Introduction\nThese are notes from a minicourse given at a workshop in Melbourne July 11\u201315\n2011. There is little pretension to originality; the main novelty is firstly that we\ngive a new (and much shorter) proof of Coornaert's theorem on Patterson\u2013Sullivan\nDate: October 24, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nmeasures for hyperbolic groups (Theorem 2.5.4), and secondly that we explain how\nto combine the results of Calegari\u2013Fujiwara in [8] with that of Pollicott\u2013Sharp [35]\nto prove central limit theorems for quite general classes of functions on hyperbolic\ngroups (Corollary 3.7.5 and Theorem 3.7.6), crucially without the hypothesis that\nthe Markov graph encoding an automatic structure is ergodic.\nA final section on random walks is much more cursory.\n2. Hyperbolic groups\n2.1. Coarse geometry. The fundamental idea in geometric group theory is to\nstudy groups as automorphisms of geometric spaces, and as a special case, to study\nthe group itself (with its canonical self-action) as a geometric space. This is accomplished most directly by means of the Cayley graph construction.\nDefinition 2.1.1 (Cayley graph). Let G be a group and S a (usually finite) generating set. Associated to G and S we can form the Cayley graph CS (G). This is\na graph with vertex set G, and with an edge from g to gs for all g \u2208 G and s \u2208 S.\nThe action of G on itself by (left) multiplication induces a properly discontinuous\naction of G on CS (G) by simplicial automorphisms.\nIf G has no 2-torsion, the action is free and properly discontinuous, and the\nquotient is a wedge of |S| circles XS . In this case, if G has a presentation G =\nhS | Ri we can think of CS (G) as the covering space of XS corresponding to the\nsubgroup of the free group FS normally generated by R, and the action of G on\nCS (G) is the deck group of the covering.\n\nFigure 1. The Cayley graph of F2 = ha, b | i with generating set\nS = {a, b}\nWe assume the reader is familiar with the notion of a metric space, i.e. a space\nX together with a symmetric non-negative real-valued function dX on X \u00d7 X\nwhich vanishes precisely on the diagonal, and which satisfies the triangle inequality\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n3\n\ndX (x, y) + dX (y, z) \u2265 dX (x, z) for each triple x, y, z \u2208 X. A metric space is a path\nmetric space if for each x, y \u2208 X, the distance dX (x, y) is equal to the infimum of\nthe set of numbers L for which there is a 1-Lipschitz map \u03b3 : [0, L] \u2192 X sending\n0 to x and L to y. It is a geodesic metric space if it is a path metric space and if\nthe infimum is achieved on some \u03b3 for each pair x, y; such a \u03b3 is called a geodesic.\nFinally, a metric space is proper if closed metric balls of bounded radius are compact\n(equivalently, for each point x the function d(x, *) : X \u2192 R is proper).\nThe graph CS (G) can be canonically equipped with the structure of a geodesic\nmetric space. This is accomplished by making each edge isometric to the Euclidean\nunit interval. If S is finite, CS (G) is proper. Note that G itself inherits a subspace\nmetric from CS (G), called the word metric. We denote the word metric by dS , and\ndefine |g|S (or just |g| if S is understood) to be dS (id, g). Observe that dS (g, h) =\n|g \u22121 h|S = |h\u22121 g|S and that |g|S is the length of the shortest word in elements of S\nand their inverses representing the element g.\nThe most serious shortcoming of this construction is its dependence on the choice\nof a generating set S. Different choices of generating set S give rise to different\nspaces CS (G) which are typically not even homeomorphic. The standard way to\nresolve this issue is to coarsen the geometric category in which one works.\nDefinition 2.1.2. Let X, dX and Y, dY be metric spaces. A map f : X \u2192 Y\n(not assumed to be continuous) is a quasi-isometric map if there are constants\nK \u2265 1, \u01eb \u2265 0 so that\nK \u22121 dX (x1 , x2 ) \u2212 \u01eb \u2264 dY (f (x1 ), f (x2 )) \u2264 KdX (x1 , x2 ) + \u01eb\n\nfor all x1 , x2 \u2208 X. It is said to be a quasi-isometry if further f (X) is a net in Y ;\nthat is, if there is some R so that Y is equal to the R-neighborhood of f (X).\nOne also uses the terminology K, \u01eb quasi-isometric map or K, \u01eb quasi-isometry if\nthe constants are specified. Note that a K, 0 quasi-isometric map is the same thing\nas a K bilipschitz map. The best constant K is called the multiplicative constant,\nand the best \u01eb the additive constant of the map.\nWe denote the R-neighborhood of a set \u03a3 by NR (\u03a3). Hence a quasi-isometry is\na quasi-isometric map for which Y = NR (f (X)) for some R.\nRemark 2.1.3. It is much more common to use the terminology quasi-isometric\nembedding instead of quasi-isometric map as above; we consider this terminology\nmisleading, and therefore avoid it.\nLemma 2.1.4. Quasi-isometry is an equivalence relation.\nProof. Reflexivity and transitivity are obvious, so we must show symmetry. For\neach y \u2208 Y choose x \u2208 X with dY (y, f (x)) \u2264 R (such an x exists by definition) and\ndefine g(y) = x. Observe dY (y, f g(y)) \u2264 R by definition. Then\ndX (g(y1 ), g(y2 )) \u2264 KdY (f g(y1 ), f g(y2 )) + K\u01eb \u2264 KdY (y1 , y2 ) + K(\u01eb + 2R)\n\nSimilarly,\n\ndX (g(y1 ), g(y2 )) \u2265 K \u22121 dY (f g(y1 ), f g(y2 )) \u2212 K \u22121 \u01eb \u2265 K \u22121 dY (y1 , y2 ) \u2212 K \u22121 (\u01eb + 2R)\n\nproving symmetry.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that the compositions f g and gf as above move points a bounded distance.\nOne can define a category in which objects are equivalence classes of metric spaces\n\n\f4\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nunder the equivalence relation generated by thickening (i.e. isometric inclusion as\na net in a bigger space), and morphisms are equivalence classes of quasi-isometric\nmaps, where two maps are equivalent if their values on each point are a uniformly\nbounded distance apart. In this category, quasi-isometries are isomorphisms. In\nparticular, the set of quasi-isometries of a metric space X, modulo maps that move\npoints a bounded distance, is a group, denoted QI(X), which only depends on the\nquasi-isometry type of X. Determining QI(X), even for very simple spaces, is\ntypically extraordinarily difficult.\nExample 2.1.5. A metric space X, dX is quasi-isometric to a point if and only if it\nhas bounded diameter. A Cayley graph CS (G) (for S finite) is quasi-isometric to a\npoint if and only if G is finite.\nExample 2.1.6. If S and T are two finite generating sets for a group G then the\nidentity map from G to itself is a quasi-isometry (in fact, a bilipschitz map) of G, dS\nto G, dT . For, there are constants C1 and C2 so that dT (s) \u2264 C1 for all s \u2208 S, and\ndS (t) \u2264 C2 for all t \u2208 T , and therefore C2\u22121 dT (g, h) \u2264 dS (g, h) \u2264 C1 dT (g, h).\nBecause of this, the quasi-isometry class of G, dS is independent of the choice of\nfinite generating set, and we can speak unambiguously of the quasi-isometry class\nof G.\nThe Schwarz Lemma connects the geometry of groups to the geometry of spaces\nthey act on.\nLemma 2.1.7 (Schwarz Lemma). Let G act properly discontinuously and cocompactly by isometries on a proper geodesic metric space X. Then G is finitely generated by some set S, and the orbit map G \u2192 X sending g to gx (for any x \u2208 X)\nis a quasi-isometry from G, dS to X.\nProof. Since X is proper and G acts cocompactly there is an R so that GNR (x) =\nX. Note that Gx is a net, since every point of X is contained in some translate gB\nand is therefore within distance R of gx.\nLet B = N2R+1 (x). Since G acts properly discontinuously, there are only finitely\nmany g in G for which gB \u2229 B is nonempty; let S be the nontrivial elements of this\nset.\nNow, if g, h \u2208 G are arbitrary, let \u03b3 be a geodesic in X from gx to hx. Parameterize \u03b3 by arclength, and for each integer i \u2208 (0, |\u03b3|) let gi be such that\ndX (gi x, \u03b3(i)) \u2264 R. Then gi\u22121 gi+1 \u2208 S and therefore\ndS (g, h) = |g \u22121 h| \u2264 |\u03b3| + 1 = d(gx, hx) + 1\n\nwhich shows incidentally that S generates G.\nConversely, if L := dS (g, h) and gi is a sequence of elements with g0 = g and\ngL = h and each gi\u22121 gi+1 \u2208 S, then there is a path \u03b3i from gi x to gi+1 x of length\nat most 4R + 2, and the concatenation of these paths certifies that\nd(gx, hx) \u2264 (4R + 2)|g \u22121 h| = (4R + 2)dS (g, h)\n\nThis completes the proof of the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 2.1.8. If G is a group and H is a subgroup of finite index, then G and H are\nquasi-isometric (for, both act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on CS (G)).\nTwo groups are said to be commensurable if they have isomorphic subgroups of finite\nindex; the same argument shows that commensurable groups are quasi-isometric.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n5\n\nExample 2.1.9. Any two regular trees of (finite) valence \u2265 3 are quasi-isometric;\nfor, any such tree admits a cocompact action by a free group of finite rank, and\nany two free groups of finite rank are commensurable.\nExample 2.1.10. The set of ends of a geodesic metric space is a quasi-isometry\ninvariant. A famous theorem of Stallings [39] says that a finitely generated group\nwith more than one end splits over a finite subgroup; it follows that the property\nof splitting over a finite subgroup is a quasi-isometry invariant.\nFiniteness of the edge groups (in a splitting) is detected quasi-isometrically by\nthe existence of separating compact subsets. Quasi-isometry can further detect\nthe finiteness of the vertex groups, and in particular one observes that a group is\nquasi-isometric to a free group if and only if it is virtually free.\nExample 2.1.11. Any two groups that act cocompactly and properly discontinuously on the same space X are quasi-isometric. For example, if M1 , M2 are closed\nRiemannian manifolds with isometric universal covers, then \u03c01 (M1 ) and \u03c01 (M2 ) are\nquasi-isometric. It is easy to produce examples for which the groups in question\nare not commensurable; for instance, a pair of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds M1 ,\nM2 with different invariant trace fields (see [27]).\nRemark 2.1.12. In the geometric group theory literature, Lemma 2.1.7 is often\ncalled the \"Milnor\u2013\u0160varc (or \u0160varc-Milnor) Lemma\"; \"\u0160varc\" here is in fact the\nwell-known mathematical physicist Albert Schwarz; it is our view that the orthography \"\u0160varc\" tends to obscure this. Actually, the content of this Lemma was first\nobserved by Schwarz in the early 50's and only rediscovered 15 years later by Milnor\nat a time when the work of Soviet mathematicians was not widely disseminated in\nthe west.\n2.2. Hyperbolic spaces. In a geodesic metric space a geodesic triangle is just a\nunion of three geodesics joining three points in pairs. If the three points are x, y, z\nwe typically denote the (oriented) geodesics by xy, yz and zx respectively; this\nnotation obscures the possibility that the geodesics in question are not uniquely\ndetermined by their endpoints.\nDefinition 2.2.1. A geodesic metric space X, dX is \u03b4-hyperbolic if for any geodesic\ntriangle, each side of the triangle is contained in the \u03b4-neighborhood of the union\nof the other two sides. A metric space is hyperbolic if it is \u03b4-hyperbolic for some \u03b4.\nOne sometimes says that geodesic triangles are \u03b4-thin.\nExample 2.2.2. A tree is 0-hyperbolic.\nExample 2.2.3. Hyperbolic space (of any dimension) is \u03b4-hyperbolic for a uniform\n\u03b4.\nExample 2.2.4. If X is a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold with curvature bounded above by some K < 0 then X is \u03b4-hyperbolic for some \u03b4 depending\non K.\nDefinition 2.2.5. A geodesic metric space X is CAT(K) for some K if triangles\nare thinner than comparison triangles in a space of constant curvature K. This\nmeans that if xyz is a geodesic triangle in X, and x\u2032 y \u2032 z \u2032 is a geodesic triangle in a\ncomplete simply connected Riemannian manifold Y of constant curvature K with\nedges of the same lengths, and \u03c6 : xyz \u2192 x\u2032 y \u2032 z \u2032 is an isometry on each edge, then\nfor any w \u2208 yz we have dX (x, w) \u2264 dY (x\u2032 , \u03c6(w)).\n\n\f6\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nFigure 2. A \u03b4-thin triangle; the gray tubes have thickness \u03b4.\nThe initials CAT stand for Cartan\u2013Alexandrov\u2013Toponogov, who made substantial contributions to the theory of comparison geometry.\nExample 2.2.6. From the definition, a CAT(K) space is \u03b4-hyperbolic whenever the\ncomplete simply connected Riemannian 2-manifold of constant curvature K is \u03b4hyperbolic. Hence a CAT(K) space is hyperbolic if K < 0.\nExample 2.2.7. Nearest point projection to a convex subset of a CAT(K) space\nwith K \u2264 0 is distance nonincreasing. Therefore the subspace metric and the path\nmetric on a convex subset of a CAT(K) space agree, and such a subspace is itself\nCAT(K).\nThinness of triangles implies thinness of arbitrary polygons.\nExample 2.2.8. Let X be \u03b4-hyperbolic and let abcd be a geodesic quadrilateral.\nThen either there are points on ab and cd at distance \u2264 2\u03b4 or there are points on\nad and bc at distance \u2264 2\u03b4, or possibly both.\n\nFigure 3. Two ways that a quadrilateral can be thin\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n7\n\nThe number of essentially distinct ways in which an n-gon can be thin is equal\nto the nth Catalan number. By cutting up a polygon into triangles and examining\nthe implications of \u03b4-thinness for each triangle, one can reason about the geometry\nof complicated configurations in \u03b4-hyperbolic space.\nLemma 2.2.9. Let X be \u03b4-hyperbolic, let \u03b3 be a geodesic segment/ray/line in X,\nand let p \u2208 X. Then there is a point q on \u03b3 realizing the infimum of distance from\np to points on \u03b3, and moreover for any two such points q, q \u2032 we have dX (q, q \u2032 ) \u2264 4\u03b4.\nProof. The existence of some point realizing the infimum follows from the properness of d(p, *) : \u03b3 \u2192 R, valid for any geodesic in any metric space.\nLet q, q \u2032 be two such points, and if d(q, q \u2032 ) > 4\u03b4 let q \u2032\u2032 be the midpoint of the\nsegment qq \u2032 , so d(q, q \u2032\u2032 ) = d(q \u2032\u2032 , q \u2032 ) > 2\u03b4. Without loss of generality there is r on\npq with d(r, q \u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b4 hence d(r, q) > \u03b4. But then\nd(p, q \u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 d(p, r) + d(r, q \u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 d(p, r) + \u03b4 < d(p, r) + d(r, q) = d(p, q)\n\ncontrary to the fact that q minimizes the distance from p to points on \u03b3.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.2.9 says that there is an approximate \"nearest point projection\" map \u03c0\nfrom X to any geodesic \u03b3 (compare with Example 2.2.7). This map is not continuous, but nearby points must map to nearby points, in the sense that d(\u03c0(x), \u03c0(y)) \u2264\nd(x, y) + 8\u03b4.\nWe would now like to show that the property of being hyperbolic is preserved under quasi-isometry. The problem is that the property of \u03b4-hyperbolicity is expressed\nin terms of geodesics, and quasi-isometries do not take geodesics to geodesics.\nA quasigeodesic segment/ray/line is the image of a segment/ray/line in R under\na quasi-isometric map. For infinite or semi-infinite intervals this definition has\ncontent; for finite intervals this definition has no content without specifying the\nconstants involved. Hence we can talk about a K, \u01eb quasigeodesic segment/ray/line.\nLemma 2.2.10 (Morse lemma). Let X, dX be a proper \u03b4-hyperbolic space. Then\nfor any K, \u01eb there is a constant C (depending in an explicit way on K, \u01eb, \u03b4) so that\nany K, \u01eb quasigeodesic \u03b3 is within Hausdorff distance C of a genuine geodesic \u03b3 g .\nIf \u03b3 has one or two endpoints, \u03b3 g can be chosen to have the same endpoints.\nProof. If \u03b3 is noncompact, it can be approximated on compact subsets by finite\nsegments \u03b3i . If we prove the lemma for finite segments, then a subsequence of the\n\u03b3ig , converging on compact subsets, will limit to \u03b3 g with the desired properties (here\nis where we use properness of X). So it suffices to prove the lemma for \u03b3 a segment.\nIn this case choose any \u03b3 g with the same endpoints as \u03b3. We need to estimate\nthe Hausdorff distance from \u03b3 to \u03b3 g . Fix some constant C and suppose there are\npoints p, p\u2032 on \u03b3 that are both distance C from \u03b3 g , but d(r, \u03b3 g ) \u2265 C for all r on \u03b3\nbetween p and p\u2032 . Choose pi a sequence of points on \u03b3 and qi a sequence of points\non \u03b3 g closest to the pi so that d(qi , qi+1 ) = 11\u03b4.\nConsider the quadrilateral pi pi+1 qi+1 qi . By Example 2.2.8 either there are close\npoints on pi pi+1 and qi qi+1 , or close points on pi qi and pi+1 qi+1 (or possibly both).\nSuppose there are points ri on pi qi and ri+1 on pi+1 qi+1 with d(ri , ri+1 ) \u2264 2\u03b4. Then\nany nearest point projections of ri and ri+1 to \u03b3 g must be at most distance 10\u03b4\napart. But qi and qi+1 are such nearest point projections, by definition, and satisfy\nd(qi , qi+1 ) = 11\u03b4. So it must be instead that there are points ri on pi pi+1 and si\non qi qi+1 which are at most 2\u03b4 apart. But this means that d(pi , pi+1 ) \u2265 2C \u2212 4\u03b4,\n\n\f8\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nso the length of \u03b3 between p and p\u2032 is at least (2C \u2212 4)d(q, q \u2032 )/11\u03b4 where q, q \u2032 are\npoints on \u03b3 closest to p, p\u2032 . On the other hand, d(p, p\u2032 ) \u2264 2C + d(q, q \u2032 ). Since \u03b3 is a\nK, \u01eb quasigeodesic, if d(q, q \u2032 ) is big enough, we get a uniform bound on C in terms\nof K, \u01eb, \u03b4. The remaining case where d(q, q \u2032 ) is itself uniformly bounded but C is\nunbounded quickly leads to a contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.2.11. Let Y be \u03b4-hyperbolic and let f : X \u2192 Y be a K, \u01eb quasiisometry. Then X is \u03b4 \u2032 -hyperbolic for some \u03b4. Hence the property of being hyperbolic\nis a quasi-isometry invariant.\nProof. Let \u0393 be a geodesic triangle in X with vertices a, b, c. Then the edges of\nf (\u0393) are K, \u01eb quasigeodesics in Y , and are therefore within Hausdorff distance C of\ngeodesics with the same endpoints. It follows that every point on f (ab) is within\ndistance 2C + \u03b4 of f (ac) \u222a f (bc) and therefore every point on ab is within distance\nK(2C + \u03b4) + \u01eb of ac \u222a bc.\n\u0003\nThe Morse Lemma lets us promote quasigeodesics to (nearby) geodesics. The\nnext lemma says that quasigeodesity is a local condition.\nDefinition 2.2.12. A path \u03b3 in X is a k-local geodesic if the subsegments of length\n\u2264 k are geodesics. Similarly, \u03b3 is a k-local K, \u01eb quasigeodesic if the subsegments of\nlength \u2264 k are K, \u01eb quasigeodesics.\nLemma 2.2.13 (k-local geodesics). Let X be a \u03b4-hyperbolic geodesic space, and let\nk > 8\u03b4. Then any k-local geodesic is K, \u01eb quasigeodesic for K, \u01eb depending explicitly\non \u03b4.\nMore generally, for any K, \u01eb there is a k and constants K \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 so that any k-local\nK, \u01eb quasigeodesic is a K \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 quasigeodesic.\nProof. Let \u03b3 be a k-local geodesic segment from p to q, and let \u03b3 g be any geodesic\nfrom p to q. Let r be a point on \u03b3 furthest from \u03b3 g , and let r be the midpoint of\nan arc r\u2032 r\u2032\u2032 of \u03b3 of length 8\u03b4. By hypothesis, r\u2032 r\u2032\u2032 is actually a geodesic. Let s\u2032 and\ns\u2032\u2032 be points on \u03b3 g closest to r\u2032 and r\u2032\u2032 . The point r is within distance 2\u03b4 either\nof \u03b3 g or of one of the sides r\u2032 s\u2032 or r\u2032\u2032 s\u2032\u2032 . If the latter, we would get a path from r\nto s\u2032 or s\u2032\u2032 shorter than the distance from r\u2032 or r\u2032\u2032 , contrary to the definition of r.\nHence the distance from r to \u03b3 g is at most 2\u03b4, and therefore \u03b3 is contained in the\n2\u03b4 neighborhood of \u03b3 g .\nNow let \u03c0 : \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 g take points on \u03b3 to closest points on \u03b3 g . Since \u03c0 moves points\nat most 2\u03b4, it is approximately continuous. Since \u03b3 is a k-local geodesic, the map\n\u03c0 is approximately monotone; i.e. if pi are points on \u03b3 with d(pi , pi+1 ) = k moving\nmonotonely from one end of \u03b3 to the other, then d(\u03c0(pi ), \u03c0(pi+1 )) \u2265 k \u2212 4\u03b4 and the\nprojections also move monotonely along \u03b3. In particular, d(pi , pj ) \u2265 (k \u2212 4\u03b4)|i \u2212 j|\nand \u03c0 is a quasi-isometry. The constants involved evidently depend only on \u03b4 and\nk, and the multiplicative constant evidently goes to 1 as k gets large.\nThe more general fact is proved similarly, by using Lemma 2.2.10 to promote\nlocal quasigeodesics to local geodesics, and then back to global quasigeodesics. \u0003\n2.3. Hyperbolic groups. Corollary 2.2.11 justifies the following definition:\nDefinition 2.3.1. A group G is hyperbolic if CS (G) is \u03b4-hyperbolic for some \u03b4 for\nsome (and hence for any) finite generating set S.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n9\n\nExample 2.3.2. Free groups are hyperbolic, since their Cayley graphs (with respect\nto a free generating set) are trees which are 0-hyperbolic.\nExample 2.3.3. Virtually free groups, being precisely the groups quasi-isometric to\ntrees, are hyperbolic. A group quasi-isometric to a point or to R is finite or virtually\nZ respectively; such groups are called elementary hyperbolic groups; all others are\nnonelementary.\nExample 2.3.4. Fundamental groups of closed surfaces with negative Euler characteristic are hyperbolic. By the uniformization theorem, each such surface can be\ngiven a hyperbolic metric, exhibiting \u03c01 as a cocompact group of isometries of the\nhyperbolic plane.\nExample 2.3.5. A Kleinian group is a finitely generated discrete subgroup of the\ngroup of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space. A Kleinian group G is is convex cocompact\nif it acts cocompactly on the convex hull of its limit set (in the sphere at infinity).\nSuch a convex hull is CAT(\u22121), so a convex cocompact Kleinian group is hyperbolic.\nSee e.g. [28] for an introduction to Kleinian groups.\nLemma 2.3.6 (invariant quasiaxis). Let G be hyperbolic. Then there are finitely\nmany conjugacy classes of torsion elements (and therefore a bound on the order of\nthe torsion) and there are constants K, \u01eb so that for any nontorsion element g there\nis a K, \u01eb quasigeodesic \u03b3 invariant under g on which g acts as translation.\nProof. Let g \u2208 G be given. Consider the action of g on the Cayley graph CS (G).\nThe action is simplicial, so p \u2192 d(p, gp) has no strict local minima in the interior\nof edges, and takes integer values at the vertices (which correspond to elements of\nG). It follows that there is some h for which d(h, gh) is minimal, and we can take\nh to be an element of G (i.e. a vertex). If d(h, gh) = k > 8\u03b4 then we can join h to\ngh by a geodesic \u03c3 and let \u03b3 = \u222ai g i \u03c3. Note that g acts on \u03b3 by translation through\ndistance k; since this is the minimum distance that g moves points of G, it follows\nthat \u03b3 is a k-local geodesic (and therefore a K, \u01eb quasigeodesic by Lemma 2.2.13).\nNote in this case that g has infinite order.\nOtherwise there is h moved a least distance by g so that d(h, gh) \u2264 8\u03b4. Since\nG acts cocompactly on itself, there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of\nelements that move some point any uniformly bounded distance, so if g is torsion\nwe are done. If g is not torsion, its orbits are proper, so for any T there is an\nN so that d(h, g N h) > T ; choose T (and N ) much bigger than some fixed (but\nbig) n. Let \u03b3 be a geodesic from h to g N h. Then for any 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n the geodesic\ng i \u03b3 has endpoints within distance 8\u03b4n of the endpoints of \u03b3. On the other hand,\n|\u03b3| = T \u226b 8\u03b4n so \u03b3 contains a segment \u03c3 of length at least T \u2212 16\u03b4n \u2212 O(\u03b4) such\nthat g i \u03c3 is contained in the 2\u03b4 neighborhood of \u03b3 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. To see this,\nconsider the quadrilateral with successive vertices h, g N h, g i+N h and g i h. Two\nnonadjacent sides must contain points which are at most 2\u03b4 apart. Since N \u226b i,\nthe sides must be \u03b3 and g i \u03b3. We find \u03c3 and g i \u03c3 in the region where these two\ngeodesics are close.\nConsequently, for any p \u2208 \u03c3 the sequence p, gp, * * * , g n p is a K, \u01eb quasigeodesic\nfor some uniform K, \u01eb independent of n. In particular there is a constant C (independent of n) so that d(p, g i p) \u2265 iC for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and therefore the infinite\nsequence g i p for i \u2208 Z is an (nC)-local K, \u01eb quasigeodesic. Since K, \u01eb is fixed, if n is\nbig enough, this infinite sequence is an honest K \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 quasigeodesic invariant under\ng, by Lemma 2.2.13. Here K \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 depends only on \u03b4 and G, and not on g.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nLemma 2.3.6 can be weakened considerably, and it is frequently important to\nstudy actions which are not necessarily cocompact on \u03b4-hyperbolic spaces which are\nnot necessarily proper. The quasigeodesic \u03b3 invariant under g is called a quasiaxis.\nQuasiaxes in \u03b4-hyperbolic spaces are (approximately) unique:\nLemma 2.3.7. Let G be hyperbolic, and let g have infinite order. Let \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032\nbe g-invariant K, \u01eb quasigeodesics (i.e. quasiaxes for g). Then \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 are a\nfinite Hausdorff distance apart, and this finite distance depends only on K, \u01eb and \u03b4.\nConsequently the centralizer C(g) is virtually Z.\nProof. Let p \u2208 \u03b3 and p\u2032 \u2208 \u03b3 \u2032 a closest point to p. Since g acts on both \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032\ncocompactly, there is a constant C so that every point in \u03b3 or \u03b3 \u2032 is within C from\nsome point in the orbit of p or p\u2032 . This implies that the Hausdorff distance from \u03b3\nto \u03b3 \u2032 is at most 2C + d(p, p\u2032 ); in particular, this distance is finite.\nPick two points on \u03b3 very far away from each other; each is distance at most\n2C + d(p, p\u2032 ) from \u03b3 \u2032 , and therefore most of the geodesic between them is within\ndistance 2\u03b4 of the geodesic between corresponding points on \u03b3 \u2032 . But \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032\nare themselves K, \u01eb quasigeodesic, and therefore uniformly close to these geodesics.\nHence some points on \u03b3 are within a uniformly bounded distance of \u03b3 \u2032 , and therefore\nall points on \u03b3 are.\nIf h commutes with g, then h must permute the quasiaxes of g. Therefore h\ntakes points on any quasiaxis \u03b3 for g to within a bounded distance of \u03b3. Hence\nC(g), thought of as a subset of G, is quasiisometric to a quasiaxis (that is to say,\nto R), and is therefore virtually Z.\n\u0003\nThis shows that a hyperbolic group cannot contain a copy of Z \u2295 Z (or, for that\nmatter, the fundamental group of a Klein bottle). This is more subtle than it might\nseem; Z \u2295 Z can act freely and properly discontinuously by isometries on a proper\n\u03b4-hyperbolic space - for example, as a parabolic subgroup of the isometries of H3 .\nExample 2.3.8. If M is a closed 3-manifold, then \u03c01 (M ) is hyperbolic if and only if\nit does not contain any Z \u2295 Z subgroup. Note that this includes the possibility that\n\u03c01 (M ) is elementary hyperbolic (for instance, finite). This follows from Perelman's\nGeometrization Theorem [31, 32].\nIf g is an isometry of any metric space X, the translation length of g is the limit\n\u03c4 (g) := limn\u2192\u221e dX (p, g n p)/n for some p \u2208 X. The triangle inequality implies that\nthe limit exists and is independent of the choice of p. Moreover, from the definition,\n\u03c4 (g n ) = |n|\u03c4 (g) and \u03c4 (g) is a conjugacy invariant.\nLemma 2.3.6 implies that for G acting on itself, \u03c4 (g) = 0 if and only if g has\nfinite (and therefore bounded) order. Consequently a hyperbolic group cannot\ncontain a copy of a Baumslag\u2013Solitar group; i.e. a group of the form BS(p, q) :=\nha, b | bap b\u22121 = aq i. For, we have already shown hyperbolic groups do not contain\nZ \u2295 Z, and this rules out the case |p| = |q|, and if |p| 6= |q| then for any isometric\naction of BS(p, q) on a metric space, \u03c4 (a) = 0.\nBy properness of CS (G) and the Morse Lemma, there is a constant N so that\nfor any g \u2208 G the power g N has an invariant geodesic axis on which it acts by\ntranslation. It follows that \u03c4 (g) \u2208 Q, and in fact \u2208 N1 Z; this cute observation is\ndue to Gromov [20].\n2.4. The Gromov boundary. Two geodesic rays \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 in a metric space X are\nasymptotic if they are a finite Hausdorff distance apart. The property of being\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n11\n\nasymptotic is an equivalence relation, and the set of equivalence classes is the\nGromov boundary, and denoted \u2202\u221e X. If X is proper and \u03b4-hyperbolic, and x is\nany basepoint, then every equivalence class contains a ray starting at x. For, if \u03b3\nis a geodesic ray, and gi \u2208 \u03b3 goes to infinity, then by properness, any collection of\ngeodesics xgi contains a subsequence which converges on compact subsets to a ray\n\u03b3 \u2032 . By \u03b4-thinness each of the triangles xg0 gi is contained in a uniformly bounded\nneighborhood of \u03b3, so the same is true of \u03b3 \u2032 ; in particular, \u03b3 \u2032 is asymptotic to\n\u03b3. We give \u2202\u221e X the topology of convergence on compact subsets of equivalence\nclasses. That is, \u03b3i \u2192 \u03b3 if and only if every subsequence of the \u03b3i contains a\nfurther subsequence whose equivalence classes have representatives that converge\non compact subsets to some representative of the equivalence class of \u03b3.\nLemma 2.4.1. Let X be a \u03b4-hyperbolic proper geodesic metric space. Then \u2202\u221e X\nis compact.\nProof. If \u03b3i is any sequence of rays, and \u03b3i\u2032 is an equivalent sequence starting at a\nbasepoint x, then by properness \u03b3i\u2032 has a subsequence which converges on compact\nsubsets.\n\u0003\nIn fact, we can define a (compact) topology on X := X \u222a \u2202\u221e X by saying that\nxi \u2192 \u03b3 if and only if every subsequence of a sequence of geodesics xxi contains a\nfurther subsequence which converges on compact subsets to a representative of \u03b3.\nWith this topology, X is compact, \u2202\u221e X is closed in X, and the inclusion of X into\nX is a homeomorphism onto its image.\nA bi-infinite geodesic \u03b3 determines two (distinct) points in \u2202\u221e X; we call these\nthe endpoints of \u03b3. Two geodesics with the same (finite or infinite) endpoints are\nHausdorff distance at most 2\u03b4 apart. Conversely, any two distinct points in \u2202\u221e X\nare spanned by an infinite geodesic \u03b3. For, if \u03b31 , \u03b32 are two infinite rays (starting at\na basepoint x for concreteness), and gi , hi are points on \u03b31 , \u03b32 respectively going to\ninfinity, some point pi on any geodesic gi hi is within \u03b4 of both xgi and xhi , and if\npi \u2192 \u221e then \u03b31 and \u03b32 would be a finite Hausdorff distance apart. Otherwise some\nsubsequence of the pi converges to p, and the geodesics gi hi converge on compact\nsubsets to a (nonempty!) bi-infinite geodesic \u03b3 through p asymptotic to both \u03b31 and\n\u03b32 . Evidently, geodesic triangles with some or all endpoints at infinity are \u03b4 \u2032 -thin\nfor some \u03b4 \u2032 depending only on \u03b4 (one can take \u03b4 \u2032 = 20\u03b4). By abuse of notation, in\nthe sequel we will call a metric space \u03b4-hyperbolic if all geodesic triangles - even\nthose with some endpoints at infinity - are \u03b4-thin.\nLet X, Y be hyperbolic geodesic metric spaces. Then any quasi-isometric map\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 Y extends uniquely to a continuous map \u2202\u221e X \u2192 \u2202\u221e Y . In particular,\nthe Gromov boundary \u2202\u221e X depends (up to homeomorphism) only on the quasiisometry type of X, and QI(X) acts on \u2202\u221e X by homeomorphisms.\nIf G is a hyperbolic group, we define \u2202\u221e G to be the Gromov boundary of some\n(any) CS (G).\nExample 2.4.2. If G is free, \u2202\u221e G is a Cantor set. If G is a \u03c01 of a closed surface\nwith negative Euler characteristic, \u2202\u221e G is a circle. If G is a convex cocompact\nKleinian group, \u2202\u221e G is homeomorphic to the limit set. For example, if G is the\nfundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary, \u2202\u221e G\nis a Sierpinski carpet.\n\n\f12\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nFigure 4. The Sierpinski carpet and the Menger sponge.\n\nIn fact, a theorem of Kapovich\u2013Kleiner [25] says that if G is a hyperbolic group\nwhich does not split over a finite or virtually cyclic subgroup, and if \u2202\u221e G is 1dimensional (in the topological sense of dimension), then \u2202\u221e G is homeomorphic to\nthe circle, the Sierpinski carpet, or the Menger sponge.\nEvidently, \u2202\u221e G is empty if and only if G is finite, and if \u2202\u221e G is nonempty, it\nhas at least two points, and has exactly two points if and only if G is itself quasiisometric to the geodesic joining these two points, which holds if and only if G is\nvirtually Z.\nIf g \u2208 G has infinite order, a quasiaxis \u03b3 is asymptotic to two points p\u00b1 \u2208 \u2202\u221e G.\nUnder (positive) powers of g, points stay a constant distance from \u03b3, and move\ntowards one of the endpoints, say p+ . As homeomorphisms from X to itself, the\nelements g n with n \u2192 \u221e converge uniformly (in the compact-open topology) on\nX \u2212 p\u2212 to the constant map to p+ . We call p+ the attracting endpoint and p\u2212 the\nrepelling endpoint of g; the actions of g on \u2202\u221e G is sometimes expressed by saying\nthat it has source-sink dynamics.\nExample 2.4.3. Let g, h \u2208 G be of infinite order, with quasiaxes \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 . If \u03b3 and\n\u03b3 \u2032 share an endpoint (without loss of generality the attracting endpoint of each)\nand p is close to both \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 , then there are ni , mi \u2192 \u221e for which d(h\u2212mi g ni p, p)\nis bounded. Since the action of G on its Cayley graph is properly discontinuously,\nit follows that there are distinct i, j with h\u2212mi g ni = h\u2212mj g nj so that hm = g n for\nsome positive n, m. In particular, in this case g and h together generate a virtual Z\nsubgroup, and their quasiaxes have the same endpoints. Otherwise the endpoints\nare disjoint, and because of the source-sink dynamics, Klein's pingpong argument\nimplies that sufficiently large powers g n , hm generate a (nonabelian) free subgroup\nof G.\nLemma 2.4.4. Suppose G is nonelementary. Then the action of G on \u2202\u221e G is\nminimal; i.e. every orbit is dense. Consequently \u2202\u221e G is infinite and perfect.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n13\n\nProof. If G is nonelementary, there are g, h whose quasiaxes have distinct endpoints\np\u00b1 and q \u00b1 respectively. If r \u2208 \u2202\u221e G is arbitrary, then either g n r \u2192 p+ or g n hr \u2192\np+ ; it follows that every attracting/repelling point is in the closure of every orbit.\nNow let \u03b3 be a geodesic from p\u2212 to p+ and let \u03b3 \u2032 be a geodesic ray asymptotic\nto r. Pick s on \u03b3 and let gi be a sequence of elements with gi (s) \u2208 \u03b3 \u2032 converging\nto r. At most one component of \u03b3 \u2212 s can come close to the basepoint x. Hence\nthere is some subsequence so that either gi p+ \u2192 r or gi p\u2212 \u2192 r, and therefore every\npoint is in the closure of the orbit of some attracting/repelling point. This proves\nthe lemma.\n\u0003\nAnother way to see the compactification \u2202\u221e X is in terms of (equivalence classes\nof) horofunctions.\nDefinition 2.4.5 (horofunction). Let \u03b3 be a geodesic ray parameterized by length.\nThe horofunction (also called the Busemann function) associated to \u03b3 is the limit\nb\u03b3 (x) := lim dX (x, \u03b3(t)) \u2212 t\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nThe level sets of horofunctions are called horospheres.\nThis limit exists and is finite, by the triangle inequality. Moreover, it is 1Lipschitz. If \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 are asymptotic, then there is some constant C(\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) so that\n|(b\u03b3 \u2212 b\u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2212 C| \u2264 2\u03b4. If x is the endpoint of \u03b3, we let bx denote any horofunction\nof the form b\u03b3 , and say that bx is centered at x.\nHere is another way to define b\u03b3 without reference to \u03b3. On any proper metric\nspace, the set of 1-Lipschitz functions mod constants is compact (in the topology\nof convergence on compact subsets). For any x \u2208 X the function dX (x, *) : X \u2192 R\nis 1-Lipschitz, and x \u2192 dX (x, *) embeds X in the space of 1-Lipschitz functions\non X mod constants. The closure of this image defines a natural compactification\nof X; quotienting further by bounded functions gives X. For each x \u2208 \u2202\u221e X the\npreimage is the set of equivalence classes of functions bx . In this way we think of\nbx as a normalization of the function which measures \"distance to x\".\nThe space \u2202\u221e X can be metrized following Gromov (see [20]).\nDefinition 2.4.6. Fix some basepoint x and some constant a > 1. The a-length\nof a rectifiable path \u03b3 in X is the integral along \u03b3 of a\u2212dX (x,*) , and the a-distance\nfrom y to z, denoted daX (y, z), is the infimum of the a-lengths of paths between y\nand z.\nA straightforward calculation shows that there is an a0 > 1 so that for a < a0 ,\nthe a-length defines a metric on X. In fact, any a0 with \u03b4 log(a0 ) \u226a 1 will work. If\na is too big, a-length still extends to a pseudo-metric on X, but now distinct points\nof \u2202\u221e X might be joined by a sequence of paths with a-length going to 0. Increasing\na will decrease the Hausdorff dimension of \u2202\u221e X; of course, the Hausdorff dimension\nmust always be at least as big as the topological dimension. In any case, it follows\nthat \u2202\u221e X is metrizable.\nThe following lemma is useful to compare length and a-length.\nLemma 2.4.7. For a < a0 there is a constant \u03bb so that for all points y, z \u2208 \u2202\u221e X\nthere is an inequality \u03bb\u22121 a\u2212dX (x,yz) \u2264 daX (y, z) \u2264 \u03bba\u2212dX (x,yz) where dX (x, yz) is\nthe ordinary distance from the basepoint x to the geodesic yz.\n\n\f14\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nFor a proof, see [13].\nThe quantity dX (x, yz) is sometimes abbreviated by (y|z) (the basepoint x is\nsuppressed in this notation), and called the Gromov product. So we can also write\n\u03bb\u22121 a\u2212(y|z) \u2264 daX (y, z) \u2264 \u03bba\u2212(y|z) . Because of this inequality, different choices of a\ngive rise to H\u00f6lder equivalent metrics on \u2202\u221e X. If X is a group G, we take id as\nthe basepoint, by convention.\nRemark 2.4.8. With our notation, (y|z) := dX (x, yz) is ambiguous, since it depends\non a choice of geodesic from y to z. Since we only care about (y|z) up to a uniform\nadditive constant, we ignore this issue. One common normalization, adopted by\nGromov, is to use the formula (y|z) := 12 (dX (x, y) + dX (x, z) \u2212 dX (y, z)). These\ndefinitions are interchangeable for our purposes, as the ambiguity can always be\nabsorbed into some unspecified constant.\nA group G acting by homeomorphisms on a compact metrizable space M is said\nto be a convergence action if the induced action on the space M 3 \u2212 \u2206 of distinct\nordered triples is properly discontinuous.\nLemma 2.4.9. The action of G on \u2202\u221e G is a convergence action. Moreover, the\naction on the space of distinct triples is cocompact.\nProof. If x, y, z is a distinct triple of points in \u2202\u221e G, there is a point p within\ndistance \u03b4 of all three geodesics xy, yz, zx; moreover, the set of such points has\nuniformly bounded diameter in G. This defines an approximate map from distinct\ntriples to points in G. Since the action of G on itself is cocompact, the same is true\nfor the action on the space of distinct triples. Similarly, if the action of G on the\nspace of distinct triples were not properly discontinuous, we could find two bounded\nregions in G and infinitely many gi in G taking some point in one bounded region\nto some point in the other, which is absurd.\n\u0003\nThe converse is a famous theorem of Bowditch:\nTheorem 2.4.10 (Bowditch's convergence theorem [3] Thm. 0.1). Let G act faithfully, properly discontinuously and cocompactly on the space of distinct triples of\nsome perfect compact metrizable space M . Then G is hyperbolic and M is Gequivariantly homeomorphic to \u2202\u221e G.\n2.5. Patterson\u2013Sullivan measure. The results in this section are due to Coornaert [12], although because of our more narrow focus we are able to give somewhat\ndifferent and shorter proofs. However by and large our proofs, like Coornaert's, are\nobtained by directly generalizing ideas of Sullivan [43] in the context of Kleinian\ngroups.\nLet G be a hyperbolic group, and let G\u2264n denote the set of elements of (word)\nlength \u2264 n, with respect to some fixed generating set. The critical exponent h(G)\n(also called the volume entropy of G) is the quantity\nh(G) := lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nlog |G\u2264n |\nn\n\nin other words, the exponential growth rate of G. Since every nonelementary hyperbolic group contains many free groups (Example 2.4.3), h(G) = 0 if and only if\nG is elementary.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n15\n\nDefine the (Poincar\u00e9) zeta function by the formula\nX\n\u03b6G (s) :=\ne\u2212s|g|\ng\u2208G\n\nThen \u03b6G (s) diverges if s < h(G) and converges if s > h(G).\nLemma 2.5.1. The zeta function diverges at s = h(G).\nProof. We will show in \u00a7 3 (Theorem 3.2.2) that for any hyperbolic group G and any\ngenerating set S there is a regular language L \u2282 S \u2217 consisting of geodesics, which\nevaluates bijectively to G. In particular,\nP |G\u2264nn| = |L\u2264n | for any n. In any regular\nlanguage L the generating function\n|L\u2264n |t is rational (Theorem 3.1.3); i.e. it\nis the power series expansion of p(t)/q(t) for some integral polynomials p, q, and\nconsequently C \u22121 (ehn nk ) \u2264 |L\u2264n | \u2264 C(ehn nk ) for some real h and non-negative\ninteger k, and constant C. Evidently, for L as above, h = h(G) and the zeta\nfunction diverges at h.\n\u0003\nFor s > h(G) construct a probability measure \u03bds on G (i.e. on G \u222a \u2202\u221e G) supported in G, by putting a Dirac mass of size e\u2212s|g| /\u03b6G (s) at each g \u2208 G. As s\nconverges to h from above, this sequence of probability measures contains a subsequence which converges to a limit \u03bd. Since the zeta function diverges at h, the\nlimit \u03bd is supported on \u2202G. This measure is called a Patterson\u2013Sullivan measure,\nby analogy with the work of Patterson and Sullivan [30, 43] on Kleinian groups.\nFor any g, the pushforward of measure g\u2217 \u03bds is defined by g\u2217 \u03bds (A) = \u03bds (g \u22121 A),\nand similarly for g\u2217 \u03bd. For any g, g \u2032 there is an inequality |g \u2032 |\u2212|g| \u2264 |gg \u2032 | \u2264 |g \u2032 |+|g|.\nFrom the definition on \u03bds , this implies that g\u2217 \u03bds is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to \u03bds , and its Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative satisfies e\u2212s|g| \u2264 d(g\u2217 \u03bds )/d\u03bds \u2264\nes|g| . Passing to a limit we deduce that e\u2212h|g| \u2264 d(g\u2217 \u03bd)/d\u03bd \u2264 eh|g| .\nThe most important property of the measure \u03bd is a refinement of this inequality,\nwhich can be expressed by saying that it is a so-called quasiconformal measure of\ndimension h. The \"conformal\" structure on \u2202\u221e X is defined using the a-distance\nfor some fixed a > 1 (recall Definition 2.4.6).\nDefinition 2.5.2 (Coornaert). For g \u2208 G define jg : \u2202\u221e X \u2192 R by\njg (y) = aby (id)\u2212by (g)\n\nfor some horofunction by centered at y. A probability measure \u03bd on \u2202\u221e X is a\nquasiconformal measure of dimension D if g\u2217 \u03bd is absolutely continuous with respect\nto \u03bd for every g \u2208 G, and there is some constant C independent of g so that\nC \u22121 jg (y)D \u2264 d(g\u2217 \u03bd)/d\u03bd \u2264 Cjg (y)D\n\nNotice that the ambiguity in the choice of horofunction by is absorbed into the\ndefinition of jg (which only depends on by mod constant functions) and the constant\nC. The support of any quasiconformal measure is evidently closed and G-invariant,\nso by Lemma 2.4.4, it is all of \u2202\u221e G.\nFrom the definition of the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative, \u03bd is a quasiconformal\nmeasure of dimension D if there is a constant C so that for all y we can find a\nneighborhood V of y in X for which\nfor all A \u2282 V .\n\nC \u22121 jg (y)D \u03bd(A) \u2264 \u03bd(g \u22121 A) \u2264 Cjg (y)D \u03bd(A)\n\n\f16\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nRemark 2.5.3. For some reason, Coornaert chooses to work with pullbacks of measure g \u2217 \u03bd := g\u2217\u22121 \u03bd instead of pushforward. Therefore the roles of g and g \u22121 are\ngenerally interchanged between our discussion and Coornaert's.\nTheorem 2.5.4 (Coornaert [12] Thm. 5.4). The measure \u03bd is a quasiconformal\nmeasure of dimension D where D = h/ log a.\nProof. Evidently the support of \u03bd is G-invariant, and is therefore equal to all of\n\u2202\u221e G. Let y \u2208 \u2202\u221e X, let by be a horofunction centered at y, and let g \u2208 G.\nBy \u03b4-thinness and the definition of a horofunction, d(g, z) \u2212 d(id, z) is close to\nby (g) \u2212 by (id) for z sufficiently close to y. In particular, there is a neighborhood V\nof y in X so that\n|g \u22121 z| \u2212 |z| \u2212 C \u2264 by (g) \u2212 by (id) \u2264 |g \u22121 z| \u2212 |z| + C\nfor some C, and for all z in V .\n\u22121\nFor each s > h we have g\u2217 \u03bds (z)/\u03bds (z) = \u03bds (g \u22121 z)/\u03bds (z) = e\u2212s(|g z|\u2212|z|) . Taking\nD\nh\nthe limit as s \u2192 h and defining D by a = e proves the theorem.\n\u0003\nTo make use of this observation, we introduce the idea of a shadow, following\nSullivan.\nDefinition 2.5.5. For g \u2208 G and R a positive real number, the shadow S(g, R) is\nthe set of y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G such that every geodesic ray from id to y comes within distance\nR of g.\nSaid another way, y is in S(g, R) if g comes within distance R of any geodesic\nfrom id to y. Given R > 2\u03b4, for any fixed n the shadows S(g, R) with |g| = n cover\n\u2202\u221e G efficiently:\nLemma 2.5.6. Fix R. Then there is a constant N so that for any y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G and\nany n there is at least 1 and there are at most N elements g with |g| = n and\ny \u2208 S(g, R).\nProof. If R > 2\u03b4, if \u03b3 is any geodesic from id to y, and if g is any point on \u03b3,\nthen y \u2208 S(g, R). Conversely, if g and h are any two elements with |g| = |h| and\ny \u2208 S(g, R) \u2229 S(h, R) then d(g, h) \u2264 2R.\n\u0003\nSullivan's fundamental observation is that the action of g \u22121 on S(g, R) is uniformly close to being linear, in the sense that the derivative d(g\u2217 \u03bd)/d\u03bd varies by a\nbounded multiplicative constant on S(g, R):\nLemma 2.5.7. Fix R. Then there is a constant C so that for any y \u2208 S(g, R)\nthere is an inequality\nC \u22121 a|g| \u2264 jg (y) \u2264 Ca|g|\nProof. Recall jg (y) = aby (id)\u2212by (g) for some horofunction by . But by \u03b4-thinness and\nthe definition of a shadow, there is a constant C \u2032 so that\n|g| \u2212 C \u2032 \u2264 by (id) \u2212 by (g) \u2264 |g| + C \u2032\nfor any y in S(g, R).\n\n\u0003\n\nFrom this one readily obtains a uniform estimate on the measure of a shadow:\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n17\n\nLemma 2.5.8. Fix R. Then there is a constant C so that for any g \u2208 G there is\nan inequality\nC \u22121 a\u2212|g|D \u2264 \u03bd(S(g, R)) \u2264 Ca\u2212|g|D\nProof. Let m0 < 1 be the measure of the biggest atom of \u03bd, and fix m0 < m < 1.\nBy compactness of \u2202\u221e G there is some \u01eb so that every ball in \u2202\u221e G of diameter\n\u2264 \u01eb has mass at most m. Now, g \u22121 S(g, R) is the set of y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G for which\nevery geodesic ray from g \u22121 to y comes within distance R of id. As R \u2192 \u221e, the\ndiameter of \u2202\u221e G \u2212 g \u22121 S(g, R) goes to zero uniformly in g (this follows from the\nquasi-equivalence of daX (y, z) and a\u2212(y|z) ; see Lemma 2.4.7). Consequently there is\nsome R0 so that for all R \u2265 R0 the measure \u03bd(g \u22121 S(g, R)) is between 1 \u2212 m and\n1, independent of g.\nNow, by Lemma 2.5.7 and the definition of a quasiconformal measure, there is a\nconstant C1 so that\nC1\u22121 a|g|D \u2264 \u03bd(g \u22121 S(g, R))/\u03bd(S(g, R)) \u2264 C1 a|g|D\n\nTaking reciprocals, and using the fact that 1 \u2212 m \u2264 \u03bd(g \u22121 S(g, R)) \u2264 1 completes\nthe proof (at the cost of adjusting constants).\n\u0003\nNote that the argument shows that \u03bd has no atoms, since any y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G is\ncontained in some shadow of measure \u2264 Ca\u2212Dn for any n. We deduce the following\ncorollary.\nCorollary 2.5.9 (Coornaert [12] Thm. 7.2). Let G be a hyperbolic group. Then\nthere is a constant C so that\nC \u22121 ehn \u2264 |G\u2264n | \u2264 Cehn\nfor all n.\nProof. The lower bound is proved in \u00a7 3, so we just need to prove the upper bound.\nFor each g with |g| = n Lemma 2.5.8 says e\u2212hn = a\u2212Dn \u2264 C1 \u03bd(S(g, R)). On\nthe other hand, Lemma 2.5.6 says that every point y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G is in at most N sets\nS(g, R) with |g| = n, so\nX\n\u03bd(S(g, R)) \u2264 N \u03bd(\u222a|g|=n S(g, R)) = N\n|Gn |e\u2212hn C1\u22121 \u2264\n|g|=n\n\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.5.9 has important consequences that we will explore in \u00a7 3.\nA second corollary gives very precise metric and dynamical control over \u2202\u221e G.\nAn action of a group G on a space X is said to be ergodic for some measure \u03bd on\nX if for any two subsets A, B of X with \u03bd(A), \u03bd(B) > 0 there is some g \u2208 G with\n\u03bd(g(A) \u2229 B) > 0.\nCorollary 2.5.10 (Coornaert [12] Cor. 7.5 and Thm. 7.7). Let \u03bd be a quasiconformal measure on \u2202\u221e G of dimension D. Then \u03bd is quasi-equivalent to D-dimensional\nHausdorff measure; i.e. there is a constant C so that C \u22121 H D (A) \u2264 \u03bd(A) \u2264\nCH D (A) for any A. In particular, the space \u2202\u221e G has Hausdorff dimension D,\nand its D-dimensional Hausdorff measure is finite and positive. Moreover, the action of G on \u2202G is ergodic for \u03bd.\n\n\f18\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nProof. Evidently, the second and third claims follow from the first (if A is a Ginvariant subset of \u2202\u221e G of positive \u03bd-measure, the restriction of \u03bd to A is a quasiconformal measure of dimension D, and is therefore quasi-equivalent to H D and\nthence to \u03bd. In particular, A has full measure). So it suffices to show that \u03bd and\nH D are quasi-equivalent.\nSince C1\u22121 a\u2212(y|z) \u2264 daX (y, z) \u2264 C1 a\u2212(y|z) it follows that every metric ball B(y, r)\nin \u2202\u221e G can be sandwiched between two shadows S(g1 , R) \u2282 B(y, r) \u2282 S(g2 , R)\nwith a\u2212|g1 | \u2265 r/C2 and a\u2212|g2 | \u2264 rC2 . From Lemma 2.5.8 we obtain C2\u22121 rD \u2264\n\u03bd(B(y, r)) \u2264 C2 rD . From this and the definition of Hausdorff measure, we will\nobtain the theorem.\nIf A is any measurable set, cover A by balls Ui of radius \u01ebi \u2264 \u01eb. Then\nX\nX\n\u03bd(Ui ) \u2264 C2\n\u01ebD\n\u03bd(A) \u2264 \u03bd(\u222ai Ui ) \u2264\ni\ni\n\nD\n\nso letting \u01eb \u2192 0 we get \u03bd(A) \u2264 C2 H (A).\nThe following proof of the reverse inequality was suggested to us by Curt McMullen. For any \u03b4 let K be compact and U open so that K \u2282 A \u2282 U and both\n\u03bd(U \u2212 K) and H D (U \u2212 K) are less than \u03b4. By compactness, there is an \u01eb so that\nevery ball of radius \u2264 \u01eb centered at a point in K is contained in U . Now inductively\ncover K by balls U1 , U2 , * * * of non-increasing radius \u01ebi \u2264 \u01eb in such a way that the\ncenter of each Ui is not in Uj for and j < i. Then the balls with the same centers\nand half the radii are disjoint, so\nX\nX\nD\n\u01ebD\n(\u01ebi /2)D \u2264 C3 \u03bd(U )\ni = 2\n\nand therefore H D (K) \u2264 C3 \u03bd(U ). Taking \u03b4 \u2192 0 gives H D (A) \u2264 C3 \u03bd(A) and we are\ndone.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5.11. Coornaert only gives the proof of the inequality \u03bd(A) \u2264 CH D (A) in\nhis paper, referring the reader to Sullivan [43] for the proof of C \u22121 H D (A) \u2264 \u03bd(A).\nHowever, there is a gap in Sullivan's proof of the reverse inequality, of which the\nreader should be warned.\nRemark 2.5.12. The approximate linearity of g \u22121 on S(g, R) has many other applications. For example, see the proof of Theorem 1 in [42].\n3. Combings\nOn a Riemannian manifold, a \"geodesic\" is just a smooth path that locally minimizes length (really, energy). A sufficiently long geodesic is typically not globally\nlength minimizing, and the entire subject of Morse theory is devoted to the difference. By contrast, one of the most important qualitative features of negative\ncurvature is that (quasi)-geodesity is a local property (i.e. Lemma 2.2.13).\nThis localness translates into an important combinatorial property, known technically as finiteness of cone types. This is the basis of Cannon's theory of hyperbolic\ngroups, and for the more general theory of automatic groups and structures (see\n[15] for more details).\n3.1. Regular languages. Let S be a finite set, and let S \u2217 denote the set of finite\nwords in the alphabet S. An automaton is a finite directed graph \u0393 with a distinguished initial vertex, and edges labeled by elements of S in such a way that each\nvertex has at most one outgoing edge with a given label. Some subset of the vertices\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n19\n\nof \u0393 are called accept states. A word w is S \u2217 determines a simplicial path in \u0393, by\nstarting at the initial vertex, by reading the letters of w (from left to right) one by\none, and by moving along the corresponding edge of \u0393 if it exists, or halting if not.\nAssociated to \u0393 there is a subset L \u2282 S \u2217 consisting of precisely those words that\ncan be read in their entirety without halting, and for which the terminal vertex of\nthe associated path ends at an accept state. One says that L is parameterized by\n(paths in) \u0393.\nDefinition 3.1.1. A subset L \u2282 S \u2217 is a regular language if there is a finite directed\ngraph \u0393 as above that parameterizes L.\nNote that \u0393 is not part of the data of a regular language, and for any given\nregular language there will be many graphs that parameterize it. A language is\nprefix-closed if, whenever w \u2208 L, every prefix of w is also in L (the empty word is\na prefix of every word).\nLemma 3.1.2. If L is prefix-closed and regular, there is a \u0393 parameterizing L for\nwhich every vertex is an accept state.\nProof. If \u0393 is any graph that parameterizes L, remove all non-accept vertices and\nthe edges into and out of them.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.1.3 (Generating function). Let L be a regular language, and for each\nn, let Ln denote the set of\nof length n,\nthe set of elements of\nP elements\nPand L\u2264n\nlength \u2264 n. Let s(t) :=\n|Ln |tn and b(t) :=\n|L\u2264n |tn be (formal) generating\nfunctions for |Ln | and |L\u2264n | respectively. Then s(t) and b(t) are rational; i.e. they\nagree as power series expansions with some ratio of integral polynomials in t.\nProof. Note that b(t) = s(t)/(1 \u2212 t) so it suffices to prove the theorem for s(t). Let\n\u0393 parameterize L, and let M be the adjacency matrix of \u0393; i.e. Mij is equal to\nthe number of edges from vertex i to vertex j. Let v0 be the vector with a 1 in\nthe initial state, and 0 elsewhere, and let va be the vector with a 1 in every accept\nT\nn\nstate, and 0 elsewhere. Then |Ln | =\nPv0 Mn va .\nA formal power series A(t) :=\nan t is rational if and only if its coefficients\nsatisfy a linear recurrence; i.e. if there are constants c0 , * * * , cd (not all zero) so that\nc0 an +c1 an\u22121 +* * *+cd an\u2212d = 0 for all n \u2265 d. For, A(t)(c0 +c1 t+* * *+cd td ) vanishes\nin degree \u2265 d, and is therefore a polynomial (reversing this argument proves the\nconverse). P\nIf p(t) = pi td\u2212i is the characteristic polynomial of M , then p(M ) = 0, and\n0 = v0T M n\u2212d p(M )va = p0 |Ln | + p1 |Ln\u22121 | + * * * + pd |Ln\u2212d |\n\nproving the theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\nAnother way of expressing s(t), more useful in some ways, is as follows.\nProposition 3.1.4. Let L be a regular language. Then there is an integer D so\nthat for each value of n mod D either |Ln | is eventually zero, or there are finitely\nmany constants \u03bbi and polynomials pi so that |Ln | = p1 (n)\u03bbn1 + * * * + pk (n)\u03bbnk for\nall sufficiently large n.\nFor a proof see e.g. [18] Thm. V.3. In particular, either |L\u2264n | has polynomial\ngrowth, or C \u22121 (nk \u03bbn ) \u2264 |L\u2264n | \u2264 C(nk \u03bbn ) for some real \u03bb and integer k, and\nconstant C.\n\n\f20\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\n3.2. Cannon's theorem. Let S be a set. A total order \u227a on S extends to a unique\nlexicographic (or dictionary) order on S \u2217 as follows:\n(1) the empty word precedes everything;\n(2) if u and v are both nonempty and start with different letters s, t \u2208 S then\nu \u227a v if and only if s \u227a t; and\n(3) if u \u227a v and w is arbitrary, then wu \u227a wv.\n\nIf G is a group and S is a generating set for G, there are finitely many geodesic words\nrepresenting any given element; the lexicographically first geodesic is therefore a\ncanonical representative for each element of g, and determines a language L \u2282 S \u2217\nthat bijects with G under evaluation. We denote evaluation by overline, so if u \u2208 S \u2217 ,\nwe denote the corresponding element of G by u. We similarly denote length of an\nelement of S \u2217 by | * |. So we always have |u| \u2264 |u| with equality if and only if u is\ngeodesic.\nGiven g \u2208 G the cone type of g, denoted cone(g), is the set of h \u2208 G for which\nsome geodesic from id to gh passes through g. For any n, the n-level of g is the\nset of h in the ball Bn (id) such that |gh| < |g|. Cannon showed that the n level\n(for n sufficiently large) determines the cone type, and therefore that there are only\nfinitely many cone types.\nLemma 3.2.1 (Cannon [10] Lem. 7.1 p. 139). The 2\u03b4 + 1 level of an element\ndetermines its cone type.\nProof. Let g and h have the same 2\u03b4 + 1 level, and let u, v be geodesics with u = g\nand v = h. Only id has an empty 2\u03b4 + 1 level, so we may assume u, v both have\nlength \u2265 1. We prove the lemma by induction. Suppose uw, vw and uws are\ngeodesics, where s \u2208 S. We must show that vws is a geodesic. Suppose to the\ncontrary that there is some w1 w2 = vws where |w1 | = |v| \u2212 1 and |w2 | \u2264 |w| + 1.\nThen h\u22121 w 1 is in the 2\u03b4 + 1 level of h, which agrees with the 2\u03b4 + 1 level of g,\nand therefore |gh\u22121 w 1 | < |g|. But then concatenating a geodesic representative of\ngh\u22121 w 1 with w2 gives a shorter path to uws, certifying that uws is not geodesic,\ncontrary to assumption.\n\u0003\nuws\nvws\nw2\nw2\ng\nh\n\nFigure 5. A shortcut w2 from the 2\u03b4 + 1 level of h to vws gives a\nshortcut from the 2\u03b4 + 1 level of g to uws. This figure is adapted\nfrom [15].\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n21\n\nThe following theorem is implicit in [10], though expressed there in somewhat\ndifferent language.\nTheorem 3.2.2 (Cannon [10]). Let G be a hyperbolic group, and S a symmetric\ngenerating set. Fix a total order \u227a on S. Then the language of lexicographically\nfirst geodesics is prefix-closed and regular.\nProof. That this language is prefix-closed is obvious. We show it is regular by\ndescribing an explicit parameterizing graph.\nAs a warm up, we show first that the language of all geodesics is regular. A\nparameterizing graph can be taken as follows. The vertices (all accept states) are\nprecisely the set of cone types, and there is an edge labeled s from a cone type of the\nform cone(g) to one of the form cone(gs) whenever |gs| = |g| + 1. By the definition\nof cone types, this is well-defined. By Lemma 3.2.1, the number of cone types is\nfinite, so this is a finite graph. By construction, this graph exactly parameterizes\nthe language of all geodesics.\nNow fix a total order \u227a on S. For each g \u2208 G, let ug be the lexicographically\nfirst geodesic from id to g. For each g \u2208 G a competitor of g is some h with |h| = |g|,\nwith uh \u227a ug , and for which d(uh |\u2264i , ug |\u2264i ) \u2264 2\u03b4 for all i, where ug |\u2264i denotes the\nprefix of ug of length i, and similarly for uh |\u2264i (this is described by saying that uh\nsynchronously fellow-travels ug ).\nIf there is some g \u2032 with |g \u2032 | = |g| + d(g, g \u2032 ) and |g \u2032 | = |h| + d(h, g \u2032 ) then by\n\u03b4-thinness and the definition of geodesics, uh synchronously fellow-travels ug . It\nfollows that for all g \u2208 G and s \u2208 S we have ugs = ug s if and only if ug s is a\ngeodesic, and there is no competitor h of g and s\u2032 \u2208 S so that hs\u2032 = gs.\n\nGiven g \u2208 G define C(g) \u2282 B2\u03b4 (id) to be the set of h for which gh is a competitor\nof g. Associated to g is the list L(g) of pairs (h \u2208 C(g), cone(gh)) together with the\ncone type of g itself. Note that the set of possible lists L(g) is finite. We can now\ndefine a parameterizing graph by taking the vertices (all accept states) to be the\npossible lists L(g), and there is an edge labeled s from a list of the form L(g) to a\nlist of the form L(gs) if and only if |gs| = |g|+1, and there is no h \u2208 C(g) and s\u2032 \u2208 S\nwith ghs\u2032 = gs. This is evidently a finite directed graph, which parameterizes the\nug ; we must show it is well-defined.\nFirst of all, h \u2208 C(gs) if and only if one of the two following possibilities occurs:\n(1) there is some h\u2032 \u2208 C(g) and s\u2032 \u2208 S \u2229 cone(gh\u2032 ) with gh\u2032 s\u2032 = gsh; or\n(2) there is some s\u2032 \u227a s in S \u2229 cone(g) with gs\u2032 = gsh.\nBoth of these possibilities depend only on C(g), cone(g) or cone(gh\u2032 ) for some\nh\u2032 \u2208 C(g), and not on g itself. Second of all, if h \u2208 C(gs), then cone(gsh) depends\nonly on cone(gh\u2032 ) and s\u2032 in the first case, and on cone(g) and s\u2032 in the second case.\nThis shows the graph is well-defined, and completes the proof of the theorem. \u0003\n\nRemark 3.2.3. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.5.1, and the subsequent results\nin \u00a7 2.5. The reader will note that the results in this section do not depend on\nLemma 2.5.1, so our reasoning has not been circular.\n3.3. Combings and combable functions.\nDefinition 3.3.1. Let G be a group, and S a generating set. A combing for G\n(with respect to S) is a prefix-closed regular language L \u2282 S \u2217 which bijects with\nG under evaluation, and satisfies |u| = |u| for all u \u2208 L (i.e. L is a language of\ngeodesics).\n\n\f22\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nTheorem 3.2.2 says that every hyperbolic group admits a combing. If L is a\ncombing with respect to S, the L-cone type of g, denoted coneL (g), is the set of\nh \u2208 G for which the L-geodesic evaluating to gh contains a prefix (which is also an\nL-geodesic) evaluating to g. There is a graph \u0393 parameterizing L with one vertex\nfor each L-cone type, and an edge from coneL (g) to coneL (gs) labeled s whenever\ns \u2208 coneL (g).\nRemark 3.3.2. The reader should be warned that many competing definitions of\ncombing exist in the literature.\nSuppose L is a combing of G, and \u0393 is a graph parameterizing L, so that there\nis a (length-preserving) bijection between directed paths in \u0393 starting at the initial\nvertex, and words of L, by reading the edge labels of the path. If u \u2208 L, we let \u03b3(u)\ndenote the corresponding path in \u0393, and \u03b3(u)i the successive vertices in \u0393 visited\nby \u03b3(u).\nDefinition 3.3.3. A function \u03c6 : G \u2192 Z is weakly combable with respect to a\ncombing L if there is a graph \u0393Pparameterizing L and a function d\u03c6 from the\nvertices of \u0393 to Z so that \u03c6(u) = i d\u03c6(\u03b3(u)i ) for all u \u2208 L.\nA function \u03c6 is combable if it is weakly combable with respect to some combing\nL, and if there is a constant C so that |\u03c6(gs) \u2212 \u03c6(g)| \u2264 C for all g \u2208 G and s \u2208 S;\nand it is bicombable if it is combable, and further satisfies |\u03c6(sg) \u2212 \u03c6(g)| \u2264 C.\nRemark 3.3.4. It might be more natural to define a function d\u03c6 on the edges of \u0393\ninstead of its vertices; however, associated to any directed graph \u0393 there is another\ngraph - the line graph of \u0393 - whose vertices are the edges of \u0393, and whose edges\nare the composable pairs of edges of \u0393, and the line graph of \u0393 parameterizes L if\n\u0393 does.\nLemma 3.3.5 (Calegari\u2013Fujiwara [8] Lem. 3.8). The property of being combable\nor bicombable does not depend on the choice of a generating set or a combing.\nThe proof proceeds along the same lines as Theorem 3.2.2. The key point is\nthat words in L are (uniformly) quasigeodesic with respect to S \u2032 , and therefore\nstay within a bounded distance of words in L\u2032 with the same evaluation. Therefore\nan automaton reading the letters of an L\u2032 -word can keep track of the states of a\ncollection of automata simultaneously reading nearby L-words, and keeping track\nof how \u03c6 changes as one goes along. See [8] for details.\nExample 3.3.6. Word length in any generating set is bicombable. In fact, if S is\na (possibly unsymmetric) set which generates G as a semigroup, word length in S\nis bicombable. One can generalize word length by giving different generators (and\ncorresponding edges in the Cayley graph) different lengths; providing the lengths\nare all integral and positive, the resulting (geodesic) word length is bicombable.\nExample 3.3.7. The sum or difference of two (bi)combable functions is (bi)combable.\nExample 3.3.8. The following definition is due to Epstein\u2013Fujiwara [16] (also see\n[5]). Let \u03c3 be a path in CS (G). A copy of \u03c3 is a translate g\u03c3 for some g \u2208 G. Given\na path \u03b3 in cS (G), define c\u03c3 (\u03b3) to be the maximal number of disjoint copies of \u03c3\nin \u03b3, and for g \u2208 G define the small counting function c\u03c3 : G \u2192 Z by the formula\nc\u03c3 (g) = |g| \u2212 inf (|\u03b3| \u2212 c\u03c3 (\u03b3))\n\u03b3\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n23\n\nCounting functions are bicombable. In fact, we can add \u03c3 to S as a (semigroup)\ngenerator, but insist that the (directed) edges labeled \u03c3 have length |\u03c3|\u22121 instead of\n1; this defines a new distance function | * |\u03c3 which is bicombable (by Example 3.3.6),\nand therefore so is the difference | * | \u2212 | * |\u03c3 = c\u03c3 (by Example 3.3.7).\nMany variations on this idea are possible; for instance, the \"big\" counting functions C\u03c3 which count all copies of \u03c3 in \u03b3, not just the maximal number of disjoint\ncopies.\n3.4. Markov chains. A directed graph \u0393 is sometimes called a topological Markov\nchain. A topological Markov chain can be promoted to a genuine (stationary)\nMarkov chain by assigning probabilities to each edge in such a way that the probabilities on the edges leaving each vertex sum to 1. Recall that we write the adjacency\nmatrix as M ; we think of this as an endomorphism of the vector space V spanned\nby the states of \u0393. Let 1 denote the vector with all components equal to 1, and let\n\u03b9 denote the vector corresponding to the initial state.\nTwo states in a topological Markov chain are said to be communicating if there\nis a directed path from each to the other. The property of being communicating\nis an equivalence relation. We write C1 \u2192 C2 for equivalence classes C1 if there is\na directed path from some (any) vertex of C1 to some (any) vertex of C2 ; observe\nthat \u2192 is a partial order. We call each equivalence class a component.\nThe induced (directed) subgraph associated to a component C is itself a topological Markov chain. Its adjacency matrix MC has the property that for any i and\nj there is an n (in fact, infinitely many n) so that (MCn )ij is positive; one says such\na Markov chain is irreducible. If there is a fixed n so that (MCn )ij is positive for all\ni, j we say the Markov chain is aperiodic; this holds exactly when the gcd of the\nlengths of all loops in C is 1. A Markov chain (on a finite state space) which is\nboth irreducible and aperiodic is ergodic.\nLemma 3.4.1 (Perron\u2013Frobenius). Let M be a real matrix with positive entries.\nThen there is a unique eigenvalue \u03bb of biggest absolute value, and this eigenvalue\nis real and positive. Moreover, \u03bb is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial,\nand it has a right (left) eigenvector with all components positive, unique up to\nscale. Finally, any other non-negative right (left) eigenvector is a multiple of the \u03bb\neigenvector.\nProof. Since the entries of M are positive, M takes the positive orthant strictly\ninside itself. The projectivization of the positive orthant is a simplex, and therefore\nM takes this simplex strictly into its interior. It follows that M has a unique\nattracting fixed point in the interior this simplex; this fixed point corresponds to\nthe unique eigenvector v (up to scale) with non-negative entries, and its entries are\nevidently all positive, and its associated eigenvalue \u03bb is real and positive.\nIf \u03c0 is any plane containing this unique positive eigenvector, the projectivization\nof \u03c0 is an RP1 ; since the eigenvector becomes an attracting fixed point in this RP1 ,\nit is not the only fixed point. This shows that \u03bb is a simple eigenvalue; a similar\nargument shows that \u2212\u03bb is not an eigenvalue.\nLet \u03bc be any other eigenvalue. If \u03bc is real, then |\u03bc| < \u03bb. Suppose \u03bc is complex,\nacting as composition of a dilation with a rotation on some plane \u03c0. If |\u03bc| = \u03bb then\nthe restriction of M to \u03c0 \u2295 hvi acts projectively like a rotation; but this contradicts\nthe fact that v is a projective attracting fixed point. This proves the theorem. \u0003\n\n\f24\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nIf M is non-negative, there is still a non-negative real eigenvector v with a\nreal positive eigenvalue \u03bb, and every other eigenvalue \u03bc satisfies |\u03bc| \u2264 \u03bb. In this\ngenerality, \u03bb might have multiplicity > 1, and the Jordan block associated to \u03bb\nmight not be diagonal. However if M is irreducible, then \u03bb has multiplicity 1, the\neigenvector v is strictly positive, and every other eigenvalue with absolute value \u03bb\nis simple and of the form e2\u03c0i/k \u03bb. These facts can be proved similarly to the proof\nof Lemma 3.4.1\nNow let G be a hyperbolic group, L a combing with respect to some generating set, and \u0393 a graph parameterizing L. Let \u0393C be the quotient directed graph\nwhose vertices are the components of \u0393. Note that \u0393C contains no directed loops.\nAssociated to each vertex of \u0393C is an adjacency matrix MC which has a unique\nmaximal real eigenvalue \u03bb(C) of multiplicity 1. We let \u03bb = maxC \u03bb(C), and we call\na component maximal if \u03bb(C) = \u03bb.\nThe next lemma is crucial to what follows, and depends on Coornaert's estimate\nof the growth function (i.e. Corollary 2.5.9).\nLemma 3.4.2. The maximal components do not occur in parallel; that is, there is\nno directed path from any maximal component to a distinct maximal component.\nProof. Since there is a directed path from the initial vertex to every other vertex,\nthe number of paths of length n is of the form p(n)\u03bbn + O(q(n)\u03be n ) for polynomials\np, q and \u03be < \u03bb, where \u03bb is as above. Moreover, the degree of p is one less than the\nlength of the biggest sequence of maximal components C0 \u2192 C1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Cdeg(p) .\nThe number of paths of length n is equal to the number of elements of G of length\nn, so Corollary 2.5.9 implies that the degree of p is zero.\n\u0003\nIt follows that all but exponentially few paths \u03b3 of length n in \u03b3 are entirely\ncontained in one of the maximal components of \u0393, except for a prefix and a suffix\nof length O(log(n)). Consequently, the properties of a \"typical\" path in \u0393 can\nbe inferred from the properties of a \"typical\" path conditioned to lie in a single\ncomponent.\nFor any vector v, the limits\n\u03c1(v) := lim n\u22121\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n\u03bb\u2212i M i v,\n\nl(v) := lim n\u22121\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bb\u2212i (M T )i v\n\ni=0\n\nexist, and are the projections onto the left and right \u03bb-eigenspaces respectively.\nHeuristically, l(v) is the distribution of endpoints of long paths that start with\ndistribution v, and \u03c1(v) is the distribution of starting points of long paths that end\nwith distribution v.\nRecall that \u03b9 denotes the vector with a 1 in the coordinate corresponding to the\ninitial vertex and 0s elsewhere, and 1 denotes the vector with all coordinates equal\nto 1. Define a measure \u03bc\u2032 on the vertices of \u0393 by \u03bc\u2032i = l(\u03b9)i \u03c1(1)i , and scale \u03bc\u2032 to a\nprobability measure \u03bc. Define a matrix N by Nij = Mij \u03c1(1)j /\u03bb\u03c1(1)i if \u03c1(1)i 6= 0,\nand define Nij = \u03b4ij otherwise.\nLemma 3.4.3. The matrix N is a stochastic matrix (i.e. it is non-negative, and\nthe rows sum to 1) and preserves the measure \u03bc.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\nProof.

Shift space. For each n let Yn denote the set of paths in \u0393 of length n starting\nat the initial vertex, and let Xn denote the set of all paths in \u0393 of length n. We\ncan naturally identify X0 with the vertices of \u0393.\nRestricting to an initial subpath defines an inverse system * * * \u2192 Xn \u2192 * * * \u2192\nX1 \u2192 X0 , and the inverse limit X\u221e is the space of (right) infinite paths. Similarly\ndefine Y\u221e \u2282 X\u221e . If we give each Xn and Yn the discrete topology, then X\u221e and\nY\u221e are Cantor sets.\nIf x := x0 , x1 , * * * and x\u2032 := x\u20320 , x\u20321 * * * are two elements of X\u221e , we define (x|x\u2032 )\nto be the first index at which x and x\u2032 differ, and define a metric on X\u221e by setting\n\u2032\nd(x, x\u2032 ) = a\u2212(x|x ) for some a > 1 (the notation (*|*) is deliberately intended to\nsuggest a resemblance to the Gromov product). If we like, we can define X =\n\u222ai Xi \u222a X\u221e and metrize it (as a compact space, in which each Xn sits as a discrete\nsubset) in the same way. Similarly, give Y\u221e the induced metric, and define Y =\n\u222ai Yi \u222a Y\u221e likewise.\nThe shift operator T : X\u221e \u2192 X\u221e is defined by (T x)i = xi+1 . We define a\nprobability measure \u03bc on each Xn by \u03bc(x0 * * * xn ) = \u03bcx0 Nx0 x1 Nx1 x2 * * * Nxn\u22121 xn\nwhere \u03bc and N are the measure and stochastic matrix whose properties are given\nin Lemma 3.4.3. By the definition of an inverse limit, there is a map X\u221e \u2192 Xn for\neach n which takes an infinite path to its initial subpath of length n; the preimages\nof subsets of the Xn under such maps are a basis for the topology on X\u221e , called\ncylinder sets. The measures \u03bc as above let us define a Borel probability measure\n\u03bc on X\u221e by first defining it on cylinder sets (note that the definitions of \u03bc on\ndifferent Xn are compatible) and extending it to all Borel sets in the standard\nway; Lemma 3.4.3 implies that \u03bc is T -invariant (i.e. \u03bc(A) = \u03bc(T \u22121 (A)) for all\nmeasurable A \u2282 X\u221e ).\nThere is a bijection between Yn and Ln , and by evaluation with Gn . This map\nextends continuously to a map E : Y \u2192 G, by sending Y\u221e \u2192 \u2202\u221e G.\nLemma 3.5.1. The map E : Y \u2192 G is surjective, Lipschitz in the a-metric, and\nbounded-to-one.\nProof. That the map is Lipschitz follows immediately from the definition, and the\nobservation that (E(y)|E(y \u2032 )) \u2264 (y|y \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b4 for y, y \u2032 \u2208 Y . The restrictions E : Yn \u2192\nGn are all bijections, so we just need to check that Y\u221e \u2192 \u2202\u221e G is surjective and\nbounded-to-one.\n\n\f26\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nSince E is continuous, Y is compact and G is Hausdorff, the image is compact.\nSince the image is dense (because it contains Gn for all n), it is surjective.\nFinally, observe that if y and y \u2032 are any two points in Y\u221e , and \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 are the\nassociated infinite geodesics in G, then \u03b3 \u2229 \u03b3 \u2032 is a compact initial segment, since\nafter they diverge they never meet again (by the definition of a combing). Fix\nx \u2208 \u2202\u221e G, let yi be a finite subset of E \u22121 (x), and let \u03b3i be the geodesic rays in\nG corresponding to the yi . For all but finitely many points p on any \u03b3i , each \u03b3j\nintersects the ball B\u03b4 (p) disjointly from the others. In particular, the number of\npoints in the preimage of any point in \u2202\u221e G is bounded by the cardinality of a ball\n(in G) of radius \u03b4.\n\u0003\nRecall that in \u00a7 2.5 we defined probability measures \u03bds on G for each s > h(G).\nNote that eh(G) = \u03bb where \u03bb is as above. For each n we define a probability measure\non Yn (which, by abuse of notation, we call \u03bds ) by \u03bds (y) = \u03bds (E(y)coneL (E(y))) for\ny \u2208 Yn , and observe that the limit as s \u2192 h(G) from above (which we denote \u03bd(y))\nexists and depends only on the cone type coneL (E(y)). Since the Patterson\u2013Sullivan\nmeasure \u03bd is supported in \u2202\u221e G, the measures \u03bd on each Yn are compatible, thinking\nof each Yn as a collection of cylinder sets in Y\u221e , and define a unique probability\nmeasure \u03bd on Y\u221e which pushes forward under E to \u03bd on \u2202\u221e G.\nPn\u22121 i\nLemma 3.5.2. The measure \u03bc on X\u221e is the limit \u03bc = limn\u2192\u221e n1 i=0\nT\u2217 \u03bd.\nProof. We give the sketch of a proof. For any y, let Ly be the (regular) language\nof suffixes of words in L P\nwith y as a prefix, and let Lyn be the subset of Ly of length\n\u22121\nn. Then \u03bds (y) = \u03b6G (s) n e\u2212s(|y|+n) |Lyn |.\nIf there is no path from the final state yn to a maximal component, the growth\nrate of Ly is strictly less than that of L, and \u03bds (y) \u2192 0. Otherwise both growth\nfunctions are eventually of the form C\u03bbn plus something P\nexponentially small comm\n1\n\u2212(|y|+i) y\n|Li |. Then\npared to \u03bbn . Define measures \u03bdm on Yn by \u03bdm (y) = m\ni=1 \u03bb\nby considering the form of the growth functions of L and Ly , we see that there is a\nconstant C (not depending on y or n) so that limm\u2192\u221e \u03bdm (y) = C\u03bd(y). Scaling \u03bdm\nto be a probability measure, we can set C = 1.\nThe proof now follows from the definition of \u03bc, N ; see [8] Lem. 4.19 for details.\n\u0003\n\n3.6. Limit theorems. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2 , * * * be a (stationary) irreducible Markov chain on\na finite state space, with stationary measure \u03bc, and let f be a real-valued function\non the state space (since this space is finite, there are no additional assumptions\non f ; in\nPngeneral we requireRf to be integrable, and have finite variance). Define\nFn := i=1 f (\u03bei ), and A = f d\u03bc.\nTheorem 3.6.1 (Markov's central limit theorem). With notation as above, there\nis some \u03c3 \u2265 0 so that for any r \u2264 s,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ s\n2\n1\nFn \u2212 nA\n\u221a\ne\u2212x /2 dx\n\u2264s = \u221a\nlim P r \u2264\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03c3 n\n2\u03c0 r\n\nEquivalently, there is convergence in probability n\u22121/2 (Fn \u2212 nA) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3)\nwhere N (0, \u03c3) denote the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation\n\u03c3 (in case \u03c3 = 0, we let N (0, \u03c3) denote a Dirac mass centered at 0).\nNow, each maximal component C as above is a stationary irreducible Markov\nchain, with stationary measure the conditional measure \u03bc|C. The measure \u03bc on X\u221e\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n27\n\ndecomposes measurably into the union of (shift-invariant) subspaces X\u221e (C), the\nsubspace of (right) infinite sequences contained in the component C. Consequently,\nif \u03c6 is a combable\nR function on G, then for each maximal component C, there are\nconstants AC = C d\u03c6/\u03bc(C)d\u03bc and \u03c3C , so that for \u03bc-a.e. x \u2208 X\u221e (C), the random\nPn\u22121\nvariable n\u22121/2 ( i=0 d\u03c6(xi ) \u2212 nAC ) converges in probability to N (0, \u03c3C ).\nBy Lemma 3.5.2, for \u03bd-a.e. y \u2208 Y\u221e there is a unique C so that T n y \u2208 X\u221e (C) for\nsufficiently big n; we say that y is associated to the component C. Let Y\u221e (C) be\nthe set of y associated to a fixed C. For \u03bd-a.e. y \u2208 Y\u221e (C) we have convergence in\nPn\u22121\nprobability n1/2 ( i=0 d\u03c6(yi ) \u2212 nAC ) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3C ) (one way to see this is to observe\nthat this is a shift-invariant tail property of y, and use Lemma 3.5.2).\nFor combable functions, this is the end of the story. It is certainly possible for\nthe constants AC , \u03c3C to vary from component to component. But for bicombable\n\u03c6 we have the following key lemma:\nLemma 3.6.2. Let \u03c6 be bicombable. Then there are constants A, \u03c3 so that AC = A\nand \u03c3C = \u03c3 for all maximal components C.\nProof. Call y \u2208 Y\u221e typical if there are constants Ay and \u03c3y (necessarily unique)\nPn\u22121\nso that n1/2 ( i=0 d\u03c6(yi ) \u2212 nAy ) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3y ). For each C we have seen that \u03bd-a.e.\ny \u2208 Y\u221e (C) is typical with Ay = AC and \u03c3y = \u03c3C .\nThe map E : Y\u221e \u2192 \u2202\u221e G is finite-to-one, and takes the measure \u03bd on Y\u221e to the\nPatterson\u2013Sullivan measure \u03bd on \u2202\u221e G. Hence E(Y\u221e (C)) has positive measure for\neach C. Let y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G be typical, and let id, g1 , g2 , * * * be the associated geodesic\nsequence of elements in G converging to E(y). Now let g be arbitrary, let y \u2032 be any\nelement of Y\u221e with E(y \u2032 ) = gE(y), and let id, g1\u2032 , g2\u2032 , * * * be the geodesic sequence of\nelements in G associated to y \u2032 . By \u03b4-thinness, d(gi\u2032 , ggi ) is eventually approximately\nconstant, and therefore bounded. Since \u03c6 is bicombable, y \u2032 is typical, with Ay\u2032 = Ay\nand \u03c3y\u2032 = \u03c3y . But the action of G on \u03bd is ergodic for \u03bd, by Corollary 2.5.10, and\ntherefore for any C, C \u2032 there are typical y \u2208 Y\u221e (C), y \u2032 \u2208 Y\u221e (C \u2032 ) with Ay =\nAC , \u03c3y = \u03c3C and Ay\u2032 = AC \u2032 , \u03c3y\u2032 = \u03c3C \u2032 , and with y \u2032 = gy for some g. This\ncompletes the proof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.6.3 (Calegari\u2013Fujiwara [8]). Let G be hyperbolic, and let \u03c6 be bicombable. Then there are constants A, \u03c3 so that if gn denotes a random element of Gn\n(in the \u03bd measure), there is convergence in probability n\u22121/2 (\u03c6(gn )\u2212nA) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3).\nNote that A and \u03c3 as above are algebraic, and one can estimate from above the\ndegree of the field extension in which they lie from the complexity of \u0393.\nThe uniform measure and the measure \u03bd on Gn are uniformly quasi-equivalent\non a large scale, in the sense that there are constants R and C so that for any\ng \u2208 Gn , there is an inequality\nC \u22121 |BR (g) \u2229 Gn |/|Gn | \u2264 \u03bd(BR (g) \u2229 Gn ) \u2264 C|BR (g) \u2229 Gn |/|Gn |\n\nIt follows that if gn denotes a random element of Gn (in the uniform measure), the\n2\ndistribution n\u22121/2 (\u03c6(gn ) \u2212 nA) has a tail that decays like C1 e\u2212C2 t .\nSince length with respect to one generating set is bicombable with respect to\nanother, we obtain the following corollary:\nCorollary 3.6.4. Let G be hyperbolic, and let S and S \u2032 be two finite generating\nsets for G. There is an algebraic number \u03bbS,S \u2032 so that if gn is a random element\n\n\f28\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nof S of word length n, then the distribution n\u22121/2 (|gn |S \u2032 \u2212 n\u03bbS,S \u2032 ) has a tail that\n2\ndecays like C1 e\u2212C2 t when n is sufficiently large.\nIt is a slightly subtle point that \u03bbS \u2032 ,S \u2265 \u03bb\u22121\nS,S \u2032 , and the inequality is strict except\nfor essentially trivial cases.\n3.7. Thermodynamic formalism. To push these techniques further, we must\nstudy classes of functions more general than combable functions, and invoke more\nsophisticated limit theorems. There is a well-known framework to carry out such\nanalysis, pioneered by Ruelle, Sinai, Bowen, Ratner, Parry etc.; [36] is a standard\nreference.\nThe setup is as follows. For simplicity, let M be a k\u00d7k matrix with 0\u20131 entries for\nwhich there is a constant n so that all the entries of M n are positive (i.e. M is the\nadjacency matrix of a topological Markov chain with k states which is irreducible\nand aperiodic). Let X\u221e be the space of (right) infinite sequences x := x0 , x1 , * * *\nsatisfying M (xn , xn+1 ) = 1 for all n, and let T be the shift operator on X\u221e . As\n\u2032\nbefore, we can metrize X\u221e by d(x, x\u2032 ) = a\u2212(x|x ) for some fixed a > 1, and observe\nthat the action of T on X\u221e is mixing. This means that for all nonempty open sets\nU, V \u2282 X\u221e there is N so that T \u2212n (U ) \u2229 V is nonempty for all n \u2265 N . Note that\nif M is irreducible but not aperiodic, there is nevertheless a decomposition of X\u221e\ninto D disjoint components which are cycled by T , and such that T D is mixing on\neach component, where D is the gcd of the periods of T -invariant sequences.\nLet MT be the space of T -invariant probability measures on X\u221e . This is a\nconvex, compact subset of the space of all measures in the weak-\u2217 topology. It is\nnot hard to show that the topological entropy h of T is equal to the supremum of\nthe measure theoretic entropies sup\u03bc\u2208MT h(\u03bc), and that h = log \u03bb where \u03bb is the\nPerron\u2013Frobenius eigenvalue of M ; see e.g. [36].\nThe shift T uniformly expands X\u221e by a factor of a, and therefore if a function\non X\u221e is sufficiently regular, it tends to be smoothed out by T . Define T \u2217 f by\nT \u2217 f (x) = f \u25e6 T x. We would like the iterates (T n )\u2217 f to have a uniform modulus\nof continuity; this is achieved precisely by insisting that f be H\u00f6lder continuous,\n\u2032\nthat is, that there is some \u03b1 so that |f (x) \u2212 f (x\u2032 )| \u2264 Cd(x, x\u2032 )\u03b1 = Ca\u2212\u03b1(x|x ) .\nThe set of functions f on X\u221e , H\u00f6lder continuous of exponent \u03b1, is a Banach space\nwith respect to the norm kf k\u221e + kf k\u03b1 where kf k\u03b1 is the least such C so that\n|f (x) \u2212 f (x\u2032 )| \u2264 Cd(x, x\u2032 )\u03b1 . We denote this Banach space C \u03b1 (X\u221e ).\nDefinition 3.7.1. Let f be H\u00f6lder\nR continuous on X\u221e . The pressure of f , denoted\nP (f ), is P (f ) = sup\u03bc\u2208MT (h(\u03bc) + f d\u03bc).\n\nIt turns out that the supremum is realized on some invariant measure \u03bcf of full\nsupport,R known as the equilibrium state (or Gibbs state) of f . That is, P (f ) =\nh(\u03bcf ) + f d\u03bcf . See e.g. [4] Ch. 1 for a proof of this theorem, and of Theorem 3.7.3\nbelow.\n\nDefinition 3.7.2. The Ruelle transfer operator Lf associated to f is defined by\nP\n\u2032\nthe formula Lf g(x) = T x\u2032 =x ef (x ) g(x\u2032 ). Note that Lf acts as a bounded linear\noperator on C \u03b1 (X\u221e ).\nTheorem 3.7.3 (Ruelle\u2013Perron\u2013Frobenius [36]). The operator Lf has a simple\npositive eigenvalue eP (f ) which is strictly maximal in modulus. The essential spectrum is contained in a ball whose radius is strictly less than eP (f ) , and the rest of\nthe spectrum outside this ball is discrete and consists of genuine eigenvalues.\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n29\n\nThere is a strictly positive eigenfunction \u03c8f satisfying Lf \u03c8f = eP (f ) \u03c8f , and an\n\"eigen probability measure\" \u03bdf satisfying L\u2217f \u03bdf = eP (f ) \u03bdf , and if we scale \u03c8f so\nR\nthat \u03c8f d\u03bdf = 1, then the equilibrium state \u03bcf is equal to \u03bdf \u03c8f .\n\nRemark 3.7.4. \u03bdf can be thought of as a left eigenvector for Lf , and \u03c8f as a right\neigenvector. When f is identically zero, Lf is basically just the matrix M , and \u03bcf\nis basically just \u03bc as constructed in \u00a7 3.4.\n\nPollicott [34] proved a complexified version of the RPF theorem, and showed\nthat P (f ) and \u03c8f are analytic on an open subset of the complex Banach space\nC \u03b1 (X\u221e , C) which contains a neighborhood of C \u03b1 (X\u221e , R) (i.e. of C \u03b1 (X\u221e )).\nBecause of the simplicity and analyticity of the maximal eigenvector/value, one\ncan study the derivatives of pressure. For simplicity, let P (t) := P (tf + g). Then\nwe can compute\nZ\nP \u2032 (0) =\n\nand a further differentiation gives\n\u2032\u2032\n\nP (0) =\n\nZ\n\nf d\u03bcg\n\nf 2 + 2f w\u2032 (0)d\u03bcg\n\nwhere w(t) = \u03c8tf +g (suitably normalized).\nPn\u22121\nNow, let Fn (x) = i=0\nf (T i x). Then from the definition of the transfer operan tFn\nn\ntor, Ltf +g (*) = Lg (e *), and therefore one obtains\nZ\n\u2032\u2032\nnP (0) = Fn2 + 2Fn w\u2032 (0)d\u03bcg\nIf we set g to be identically zero, then \u03bcg Ris just the equilibrium measure \u03bc from\nbefore. If we change f by a constant f \u2212 f d\u03bc to have mean 0, then the ergodic\ntheorem shows (1/n)Fn \u2192 0 \u03bc-a.e. and therefore\nZ\n1 2\nP \u2032\u2032 (0) = lim\nF d\u03bc\nn\u2192\u221e\nn n\nIt is usual to denote this limiting quantity by \u03c3 2 .\nThe analyticity of P lets us control the higher moments of Fn in a uniform\nmanner, and therefore by applying Fourier transform, one obtains a central limit\ntheorem n\u22121/2 Fn \u2192 N (0, \u03c3). Better estimates of the rate of convergence can be\nobtained by studying P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (0); see [11].\nThis theorem can be combined with Lemma 3.6.2 to obtain a central limit theorem for certain functions on hyperbolic groups whose (discrete) derivatives along\na combing satisfy a suitable H\u00f6lder continuity property. Such functions arise naturally for groups acting cocompactly on CAT(K) spaces with K < 0, where one\nwants to compare the intrinsic geometry of the space with the \"coarse\" geometry\nof the group.\nLet Z be a complete CAT(K) geodesic metric space with K < 0, and let G act\ncocompactly on Z by isometries. Pick a basepoint z \u2208 Z, and define a function\nF on G by F (g) = d(z, gz). Since G is hyperbolic, if we fix a finite generating\nset S we can choose a geodesic combing L with respect to S as above. Now, for\nany s \u2208 S define Ds F (g) = F (g) \u2212 F (sg). It is straightforward to see from the\nCAT(K) property that there are constants C and \u03b1 (depending on K and G) so\nthat |Ds F (g) \u2212 Ds F (h)| \u2264 Ca\u2212\u03b1(g|h) for all s and all g, h \u2208 G.\n\n\f30\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nAn element of \u222aXn corresponds to a path in \u0393. Reading the edge labels determines a word in the generators (a suffix of some word in L), and by evaluation, an\nelement of G. Let E : \u222aXn \u2192 G denote this evaluation map (note that this is not\ninjective). We can define a function DF on \u222aXn by DF (x) = Ds F (E(x)) where\ns\u22121 is the label associated to the transition from x0 to x1 (we could suggestively\nwrite s = x\u22121\nto a H\u00f6lder continuous function on X.\n1 x0 ). Evidently, DF extends\nPn\u22121\nFurthermore, for each y \u2208 Yn , we have i=0 DF (T i y) = F (E(y)).\nFor each big component C, it follows that \u03bd-a.e. y \u2208 Y\u221e (C) are AC , \u03c3C typical\n(for the function DF ) for some AC , \u03c3C depending only on C. Since F is Lipschitz\non G in the left and right invariant metrics, the argument of Lemma 3.6.2 implies\nthat AC , \u03c3C are equal to some common values A, \u03c3, and therefore we obtain the\nfollowing corollary:\nCorollary 3.7.5. Let Z be a complete CAT(K) geodesic metric space with K < 0,\nand let G act cocompactly on Z by isometries. Pick a basepoint z \u2208 Z, and a\nfinite generating set S for G. Then there are constants A and \u03c3 so that if gn is\na random element of Gn (in the \u03bd measure), there is convergence in probability\nn\u22121/2 (d(z, gn z) \u2212 An) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3).\nEvidently, the only properties of the function F we use are that it is Lipschitz in\nboth the left- and right-invariant metrics, and satisfies a H\u00f6lder estimate |Ds F (g)\u2212\nDs F (h)| \u2264 Ca\u2212\u03b1(g|h) for all s and all g, h \u2208 G. Any such function on a hyperbolic\ngroup satisfies a central limit theorem analogous to Corollary 3.7.5. For the sake\nof completeness, therefore, we state this as a theorem:\nTheorem 3.7.6 (H\u00f6lder central limit theorem). Let G be a hyperbolic group, and\nS a finite generating set for G. Let F be a real-valued function which is Lipschitz\nin both the left- and right-invariant word metrics on G, and satisfies |Ds F (g) \u2212\nDs F (h)| \u2264 Ca\u2212\u03b1(g|h) for all s in S and all g, h \u2208 G. Then there are constants\nA and \u03c3 so that if gn is a random element of Gn (in the \u03bd measure), there is\nconvergence in probability n\u22121/2 (F (gn ) \u2212 An) \u2192 N (0, \u03c3).\nRemark 3.7.7. The idea of using the thermodynamic formalism to study the relationship between distance and word length in cocompact groups of isometries of\nhyperbolic space is due to Pollicott\u2013Sharp [35]; Corollary 3.7.5 and Theorem 3.7.6\nabove are simply the result of combining their work with [12] and [8]. Nevertheless,\nwe believe they are new.\n4. Random walks\nThe main references for this section are Kaimanovich [22] and Kaimanovich\u2013\nVershik [23]. The theory of random walks is a vast and deep subject, with connections to many different parts of mathematics. Therefore it is necessary at a few\npoints to appeal to some standard (but deep) results in probability theory, whose\nproof lies outside the scope of this survey. A basic reference for probability theory\nis [41]. We give more specialized references in the text where relevant.\nThis section is brief compared to the earlier sections, and is not meant to be\ncomprehensive.\n4.1. Random walk. Let G be a group and let \u03bc be a probability measure on G.\nWe further assume that \u03bc is nondegenerate; i.e. that the support of \u03bc generates\nG as a semigroup. An important example is the case where \u03bc is the uniform\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n31\n\nmeasure on a symmetric finite generating set S. There are two ways to describe\nrandom walk on G determined by \u03bc: as a sequence of elements visited in the\nwalk, or as a sequence of increments. In the first description, a random walk\ny := id, y1 , y2 , * * * is a Markov chain with state space G, with initial state id, and\nwith transition probability pgh = \u03bc(g \u22121 h). In the second description, a random\nwalk z := z1 , z2 , * * * is a sequence of random elements of G (the increments of the\nwalk), independently distributed according to \u03bc. The two descriptions are related\nby taking yn = z1 z2 * * * zn . We write this suggestively as z = Dy and y = \u03a3z.\nWe use the notation (GN , \u03bcN ) for the product probability space, and (GN , P)\nfor the probability space of infinite sequences with the measure P on cylinder sets\ndefined by\nP({y : y begins id, y1 , * * * , yn }) = pidy1 py1 y2 * * * pyn\u22121 yn\nWith this notation, z is a random element of (GN , \u03bcN ) and y is a random element\nof (GN , P).\nThe shift operator T acts on GN by (T z)n = zn+1 or (T y)n = yn+1 . It is\nmeasure preserving for \u03bcN but not for P; in fact, from the definition, the support\nof P is contained in the set of sequences starting at id. The action of the shift T on\n(GN , \u03bcN ) is ergodic. For, if A is a subset satisfying A = T \u22121 (A), then a sequence z\nis in A if and only if T n (z) is in A for sufficiently big n. This is a tail event for the\nsequence of independent random variables zi , so by Kolmogorov's 0\u20131 law (see [41]\nThm. 1.1.2) A has measure 0 or 1.\nDefinition 4.1.1. Let G be a group and S a finitePgenerating set. Let \u03bc be a\nprobability measure on G. The first moment of \u03bc is\n|g|\u03bc(g); if this is finite, we\nsay \u03bc has finite first moment.\nLemma 4.1.2. Let \u03bc be a probability measure on G with finite first moment. Let\nid, y1 , y2 , * * * be a random walk determined by \u03bc. Then L := limn\u2192\u221e |yn |/n exists\nalmost surely, and is independent of y. In fact, if \u03bc\u2217n denotes n-fold\nP convolution\n(i.e. the distribution of the random variable yn ), then L = limn\u2192\u221e |g|\u03bc\u2217n (g).\nProof. We set z = Dy. Define hn (z) := |yn |. Then hn satisfies\nhn+m (z) \u2264 hn (T m z) + hm (z)\ni.e. hn form a subadditive cocycle. Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem (see e.g.\n[40]) says that for any subadditive L1 cocycle hn on a space with a T -invariant\nmeasure, the limit limn\u2192\u221e hn (z)/n exists a.s. and is T -invariant. In our circumstance, finite first moment implies that h1 (and all the hn ) are in L1 , so the theorem\napplies. Since the action of T on (GN , \u03bcN ) is ergodic, the limit is independent of z.\nThe lemma follows.\n\u0003\nL as above is called the drift of the random walk associated to \u03bc. Since each\n|yn | \u2265 0 we necessarily have L \u2265 0.\nExample 4.1.3. If G = Zn and \u03bc is symmetric (i.e. \u03bc(g) = \u03bc(g \u22121 ) for all g) with\nfinite support, then L = 0.\nWe now focus our attention on the case of hyperbolic groups and simple random\nwalk (i.e. when \u03bc is the uniform measure on a finite symmetric generating set).\n\n\f32\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nLemma 4.1.4. let G be a nonelementary hyperbolic group, and let \u03bc be a nondegenerate probability measure on G with finite first moment. Then the drift L of\nrandom walk with respect to \u03bc is positive.\nProof. We give the idea of a proof. Let \u03bc\u2217n denote the n-fold convolution of \u03bc as\nbefore. The probability measures \u03bc\u2217n have a subsequence converging to a weak\nlimit \u03bc\u2217\u221e in G. Clearly the support of \u03bc\u2217\u221e is contained in \u2202\u221e G (a group for which\nlim supn\u2192\u221e \u03bc\u2217n (g) > 0 for any g and for \u03bc nondegenerate is a finite group).\nTo prove the lemma itP\nsuffices to show that for any C, for sufficiently large enough\nn there is an inequality g,h (|hg| \u2212 |h|)\u03bc\u2217n (g)\u03bc\u2217N (h) \u2265 C > 0 for all N \u2265 n, since\nthen L \u2265 C/n. Now, for each h, if g satisfies |hg| \u2212 |h| < C, then the closest point\non the geodesic from h\u22121 to g is within \u03b4 of some geodesic from id to h\u22121 . So as |g|\ngoes to infinity, the a-distance from h\u22121 to g goes to 0. Hence for this inequality\nto fail to hold, almost half of the mass of \u03bc\u2217n \u00d7 \u03bc\u2217N must be concentrated near the\nantidiagonal; i.e. the set of (g, g \u22121 ) \u2282 G \u00d7 G.\nFrom this we can deduce that either the desired inequality is satisfied, or else\nmost of the mass of \u03bc\u2217n must be concentrated near a single geodesic through id.\nTaking n \u2192 \u221e, the support of \u03bc\u2217\u221e must consist of exactly two points, and G is\nseen to be elementary, contrary to hypothesis.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1.5. It is a theorem of Guivarc'h (see [46], Thm. 8.14) that if G is any\ngroup with a nondegenerate measure \u03bc (always with finite first moment) for which\nthe drift of random walk is zero, then G is amenable. Some care is required to\nparse this statement: on an amenable group some nondegenerate measures may\nhave positive drift, but on a nonamenable group, every nondegenerate measure has\npositive drift.\nA nonelementary hyperbolic group always contains many nonabelian free groups,\nand is therefore nonamenable; this gives a more highbrow proof of Lemma 4.1.4.\nLemma 4.1.6 (Kaimanovich [22] 7.2). Let X be a \u03b4-hyperbolic space. The following\ntwo conditions are equivalent for a sequence xn in X and a number L > 0:\n(1) d(xn , xn+1 ) \u2264 o(n) and d(x0 , xn ) = nL + o(n);\n(2) there is a geodesic ray \u03b3 so that d(xn , \u03b3(Ln)) = o(n).\nA sequence xn satisfying either condition is said to be regular.\nProof. That (2) implies (1) is obvious, so we show that (1) implies (2). For simplicity, we use the notation |y| := d(x0 , y). The path obtained by concatenating\ngeodesics from xn to xn+1 has finite a-length, and therefore converges to some\nunique x\u221e \u2208 \u2202\u221e X.\nLet \u03b3n (resp. \u03b3\u221e ) be geodesic rays from the origin to xn (resp. x\u221e ) and\nparameterize them by distance from the origin. Fix some positive \u01eb, and let N =\nN (\u01eb) be such that for any two n, m > N the geodesics \u03b3n and \u03b3m are within \u03b4 on\nthe interval of length (L \u2212 \u01eb)n, and let pn = \u03b3n ((L \u2212 \u01eb)n) so that d(pn , \u03b3m ) \u2264 \u03b4 for\nn > N . Now, d(pn\u22121 , pn ) \u2264 L \u2212 \u01eb + 4\u03b4 and therefore d(pn , pm ) \u2264 |n\u2212 m|(L \u2212 \u01eb + 4\u03b4).\nOn the other hand, d(pn , pm ) \u2265 ||pm | \u2212 |pn || = |n \u2212 m|(L \u2212 \u01eb). Consequently the\nsequence pi is a quasigeodesic, and therefore there is a constant H = H(\u03b4, L) so that\nd(pn , pN x\u221e ) \u2264 H for any n \u2265 N . Since pN x\u221e and \u03b3\u221e are asymptotic, d(pn , \u03b3\u221e ) \u2264\nH + \u03b4 for sufficiently large n, and therefore d(xn , \u03b3\u221e ) \u2264 H + \u03b4 + (|xn | \u2212 n(L \u2212 \u01eb))\nfor sufficiently large n. Taking \u01eb \u2192 0 proves the lemma with \u03b3 = \u03b3\u221e .\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n33\n\nTogether with Lemma 4.1.4 this gives the following Corollary:\nCorollary 4.1.7 (Kaimanovich [22] 7.3). Let G be a nonelementary hyperbolic\ngroup, and let \u03bc be a nondegenerate probability measure on G with finite first moment. Then there is L > 0 so that for a.e. random walk y there is a unique geodesic\nray \u03b3y with d(yn , \u03b3y (Ln)) = o(n).\nProof. It suffices to show that if \u03bc has finite first moment, then d(yn , yn+1 ) = o(n)\nalmost surely. Let z = Dy, and\nP for any \u01eb > 0 let En be the event that |zn | \u2265 \u01ebn.\nThen the probability of En is |g|\u2265\u01ebn \u03bc(g), and therefore\nX\nn\n\nP(En ) =\n\nX X\n\nn |g|\u2265\u01ebn\n\n\u03bc(g) \u2264\n\n1X\n(|g| + 1)\u03bc(g) < \u221e\n\u01eb\n\nTherefore by the easy direction of the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma (see e.g. [41] 1.1.4)\nthe probability that En occurs infinitely often is zero. Since this is true for every\n\u01eb, we have d(yn , yn+1 ) = |zn | = o(n) almost surely.\n\u0003\n4.2. Poisson boundary. Define an equivalence relation \u223c on GN by y \u223c y \u2032 if and\n\u2032\nonly if there are integers k, k \u2032 so that T k y = T k y \u2032 .\nDefinition 4.2.1. The measurable envelope of \u223c is the smallest measurable equivalence relation generated by \u223c. The quotient measure space (\u0393, \u03bd) of (GN , P) by\nthe measurable envelope is called the Poisson boundary of G with respect to \u03bc.\nIn other words, \u03bd-measurable functions on \u0393 correspond precisely to T -invariant\nP-measurable functions on GN . We let bnd : GN \u2192 \u0393 be the quotient map, so that\nbnd P = \u03bd.\nNow, G acts on GN on the left coordinatewise. This action commutes with T ,\nand P\ndescends to an action on \u0393. Since \u223c is T -invariant, bnd P = bnd T P, so\n\u03bd = g \u03bc(g)g\u03bd; i.e. the measure \u03bd is \u03bc-stationary.\nDefinition 4.2.2. A \u03bc-boundary is a G-space with a \u03bc-stationary measure \u03bb which\nis obtained as a T -equivariant (measurable) quotient of (GN , P).\n\nAny \u03bc-boundary factors through (\u0393, \u03bd). A \u03bc-boundary is \u03bc-maximal if the map\nfrom (\u0393, \u03bd) is a measurable isomorphism. Kaimanovich [22] gave two very useful\ncriteria for a \u03bc-boundary to be maximal.\nTheorem 4.2.3 (Kaimanovich ray criterion [22] Thm. 5.5). Let B be a \u03bc-boundary,\nand for y \u2208 GN let \u03a0(y) \u2208 B be the image of y under the (G-equivariant) quotient\nmap \u03a0 : GN \u2192 B. If there is a family of measurable maps \u03c0n : B \u2192 G such that\nP-a.e. d(yn , \u03c0n (\u03a0(y))) = o(n) then B is maximal.\nTogether with Corollary 4.1.7, this gives the following important result:\nCorollary 4.2.4 (Kaimanovich [22] Thm. 7.6). Let G be a nonelementary hyperbolic group, and let \u03bc be a nondegenerate probability measure of finite first moment.\nLet \u03a0 : GN \u2192 \u2202\u221e G take a random walk to its endpoint (which exists P-a.e.), and\nlet \u03bb = \u03a0P. Then (\u2202\u221e G, \u03bb) is the Poisson boundary of G, \u03bc.\nProof. Simply define \u03c0n to be the maps that take a point y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G to \u03b3y (nL) where\n\u03b3y is a parameterized geodesic ray from id to y, and L is the drift.\n\u0003\n\n\f34\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\n4.3. Harmonic functions.\nDefinition 4.3.1. If f is P\na function on G, the operator P\u03bc (convolution with \u03bc)\nis defined by P\u03bc f (g) :=\nh f (gh)\u03bc(h). A function f on G is \u03bc-harmonic (or\njust\nharmonic\nif\n\u03bc\nis\nunderstood)\nif it is fixed by P\u03bc ; i.e. if it satisfies f (g) =\nP\nh f (gh)\u03bc(h) for all g in G.\nP\nIn general we need to impose some condition on f for h f (gh)\u03bc(h) to be defined.\nIf the support of \u03bc is finite, then f can be arbitrary, but if the support of \u03bc is infinite,\nwe usually (but not always!) require f to be in L\u221e . We let H \u221e (G, \u03bc) denote the\nBanach space of bounded \u03bc-harmonic functions on G.\nIn probabilistic terms, if f is harmonic and y \u2208 GN is a random walk, the\nrandom variables fn := f (yn ) are a martingale; i.e. the expected value of fn given\nyn\u22121 is fn\u22121 (see e.g. [41] \u00a7 5.2 for an introduction to martingales). There is an\nintimate relation between harmonic functions and Poisson boundaries, expressed in\nthe following proposition.\nLemma 4.3.2. The Banach spaces H \u221e (G, \u03bc) and L\u221e (\u0393, \u03bd) are isometric.\nProof. Given f \u2208 H \u221e (G, \u03bc) and y \u2208 GN , the random variables f (yn ) are a bounded\nmartingale, and therefore by the martingale convergence theorem ([41] Thm. 5.2.22),\nconverge a.s. to a well-defined limit. Evidently this limit is measurable and T invariant, and therefore descends to a function on \u0393 which we denote fb. Explicitly,\nfb(bnd y) := limn\u2192\u221e f (yn ).\nR\nConversely, given fb \u2208 L\u221e (\u0393, \u03bd) we define f (g) = \u0393 fbd(g\u2217 \u03bd) (this expression is\nknown as the Poisson formula). Since \u03bd is stationary, f is harmonic.\nThe mean value property of harmonic functions implies that these maps are\nisometries, since a harmonic function achieves its maximum on the boundary. \u0003\nNote that the Poisson formula is available for any \u03bc-boundary. That is, if B\nis a G-space with a \u03bc-stationary\nprobability measure \u03bb, and fb is any element of\nR\n\u221e\nb\nL (B, \u03bb), then f (g) := B f d(g\u03bb) is a bounded harmonic function on G. If \u03bb is\nnot invariant, f is typically nonconstant.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to some miscellaneous applications of\nrandom walks to hyperbolic and other groups.\n4.4. Green metric. There is a close resemblance between the measure \u03bd and the\nPatterson\u2013Sullivan measures constructed in \u00a7 2.5. This resemblance can be sharpened if one looks at a natural metric on G adapted to the random walk, namely\nthe so-called Green metric.\nDefinition 4.4.1. Let G be a group and \u03bc a probability measure on G with finite\nfirst moment. The Green metric on G is the metric for which the distance between\ng and h is \u2212 log of the probability that random walk starting at g ever hits h.\nIf \u03bc is symmetric, so is the Green metric, since random walks are time-reversible.\nNote that the Green metric is degenerate if random walk is recurrent. For simple\nrandom walk, this occurs only if G is finite, or is virtually Z or Z2 , by a classical\nresult of Varopoulos (see [45]). For nondegenerate measures with finite first moment\non non-elementary hyperbolic groups, Blach\u00e8re and Brofferio [1] show that the\nGreen metric and the word metric are quasi-isometric (one needs to be somewhat\ncareful: the Green metric is not in general a geodesic metric).\n\n\fTHE ERGODIC THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC GROUPS\n\n35\n\nTheorem 4.4.2 (Blach\u00e8re\u2013Ha\u0131\u0308ssinsky\u2013Mathieu [2], Thm. 1.3). Let G be a nonelementary hyperbolic group, and for y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G, let B(y, R) denote the ball of radius\nR in the a-metric (see Definition 2.4.6). Let \u03bc be a symmetric probability measure\nwith finite first moment, and let \u03bd be the associated harmonic measure on \u2202\u221e G.\nThen for \u03bd-almost every y \u2208 \u2202\u221e G, there is convergence\nlim log \u03bd(B(y, R))/ log R = lG /aL\n\nR\u21920\n\nwhere L is the drift in the word metric, and lG is the drift in the Green metric.\nNote that Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem implies that the drift lG with\nrespect to the Green metric is well-defined, essentially by the same argument as the\nproof of Lemma 4.1.2.\n4.5. Harnack inequality. The classical Harnack inequality relates the values of a\npositive harmonic function at two points. In its infinitesimal version, it asserts an\nupper bound on the logarithmic derivative of a positive harmonic function.\nLet f be a non-negative boundedR harmonic function on Hn , for simplicity. The\nb\nPoisson formula says that f (p) = S\u221e\nn\u22121 f d\u03bdp where \u03bdp is the visual measure as\nseen from p. If \u03bd is visual measure as seen from the origin, and g is any isometry\ntaking the origin to p, then \u03bdp = g\u2217 \u03bd. To understand how f varies as a function\nof p therefore, it suffices to understand how \u03bdp varies as a function of p. If B is an\nn\u22121\ninfinitesimal ball centered at some point y in S\u221e\n, then the visual size of B grows\nt(n\u22121)\nlike e\nas one moves distance t in the direction of y. Hence:\nProposition 4.5.1 (Harnack inequality). Let f be a non-negative bounded harmonic function on Hn . Then the logarithmic derivative of f satisfies the inequality\n|d log f | \u2264 (n \u2212 1).\nIf f is a non-negative harmonic function on a group G, the analog of this inequality is f (gs)/f (g) \u2264 eD for any g \u2208 G and s \u2208 S where D is the dimension of\n\u03bd, which can be determined from Theorem 4.4.2.\nIf S is a closed surface of genus \u2265 2 and \u03c1 : \u03c01 (S) \u2192 G is injective, then \u03c01 (S)\nacts on G by left translation, and there is an associated foliated bundle with fiber\nthe ideal circle \u2202\u221e \u03c01 (S) with its natural \u03c01 (S) action. We can build a harmonic\n1\nconnection for this circle bundle; i.e. a choice of measure mg on the\nP circle S (g)\nover each g \u2208 G so that for any subset A \u2282 S 1 we have mg (A) =\n\u03bc(s)mgs (A).\nSince the circle is 1-dimensional, these measures integrate to metrics on the circles\nS 1 (g) for which the curvature is harmonic. The Harnack inequality then gives a\npriori bounds on this curvature, and one can deduce local compactness results for\nfamilies of injective surface maps of variable genus. For stable minimal surfaces\nin hyperbolic 3-manifolds, such a priori bounds were obtained by Schoen [38] and\nare an important tool in low-dimensional topology. The idea of using Harnacktype inequalities to obtain curvature bounds is due to Thurston [44] (also see [6],\nExample 4.6).\n4.6. Monotonicity. A norm on a group is a non-negative function \u03c4 : G \u2192 R\nso that \u03c4 (gh) \u2264 \u03c4 (g) + \u03c4 (h) for all g, h \u2208 G. A functor from groups to norms is\nmonotone if \u03c4H (\u03c6(g)) \u2264 \u03c4G (g) for any g \u2208 G and \u03c6 : G \u2192 H.\nIf \u03c4 is a norm on G, and \u03bc is a probability measure with finite first moment,\nit makes sense to study the growth rate of \u03c4 under \u03bc-random walk on G. If G\nis finitely generated, one can study the growth rate of \u03c4 under all simple random\n\n\f36\n\nDANNY CALEGARI\n\nwalks; if they all have the same growth rate, this rate is an invariant of G. Since \u03bc\nrandom walk on G pushes forward to \u03c6\u2217 \u03bc random walk on \u03c6(G) = H, the growth\nrate of a monotone family of norms cannot increase under a homomorphism; thus\nif the growth rate of \u03c4G on G is strictly smaller than the growth rate of \u03c4H on H,\nthere are strong constraints on the homomorphisms from G to H.\nAs an example, consider the commutator length cl. For any group G and any g\nin the commutator subgroup [G, G], the commutator length cl(g) is just the least\nnumber of commutators in G whose product is g (for technical reasons, one usually\nstudies a closely related quantity, namely the stable commutator length; see e.g [7]\nfor an introduction).\nOne of the main theorems of [9] is as follows:\nTheorem 4.6.1 (Calegari\u2013Maher [9]). Let G be hyperbolic, and let \u03bc be a nondegenerate symmetric probability measure with finite first moment whose support\ngenerates a nonelementary subgroup. There is a constant C so that if gn is obtained by random walk of length n, conditioned to lie in [G, G], then\nC \u22121 n/ log(n) \u2264 cl(gn ) \u2264 Cn/ log(n)\nc\n\nwith probability 1 \u2212 O(C \u2212n ).\n\nSaid another way, commutator length grows like n/ log(n) under random walk\nin a hyperbolic group. Similar estimates on commutator length can be obtained\nfor groups acting in a suitable way on (not necessarily proper) hyperbolic spaces;\nthe most important examples are mapping class groups and relatively hyperbolic\ngroups.\nAs a corollary, if H is any finitely generated group, and commutator length in\nH grows like o(n/ log(n)) for simple random walk (with respect to some generating\nset), then there are no interesting homomorphisms from H to any hyperbolic group\nG, and no interesting actions of H on certain hyperbolic complexes.\n5.
