E-mail: vorobiov@in2p3.fr\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory aims to determine the nature and origin of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR).\nThe Auger hybrid detector combines fluorescence observations of extended air showers, initiated in the atmosphere by\nthese most energetic particles, with measures of the shower front at the ground level by its large array of Cherenkov water\ntanks. This allows to improve considerably the precision on reconstructed primary cosmic ray parameters, and to make\nimportant cross-calibrations between two techniques at these energies, unreachable with accelerator experiments. The\nSouthern Auger site in Argentina is close to completion. The first measure of the primary cosmic rays energy spectrum,\nthe anisotropy search results, and the limit on the photon fraction in the UHECR are discussed.\n\n1. Objectives of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics\nDespite the recent considerable progress in cosmic ray physics domain [1], the key questions concerning ultra-high\nenergy (\u2265 1017 eV) cosmic rays are still waiting for an answer. The observation in the cosmic rays of particles with\nenergies reaching 1020 eV limits the list of potential astrophysical acceleration sites to the most energetic objects in the\nUniverse like active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts or galaxy clusters. There are also more exotic scenarios, in which\nthese highest energy particles result from interactions or decay of the primordial Universe relics such as topological\ndefects or super-heavy dark matter.\nThe first question to clarify is whether the nearly isotropic cosmic ray flux is suppressed at energies above 1019.8 eV, as\none would expect in the standard acceleration scenario with the nuclei arriving from sources at cosmological distances.\nThis spectral feature (the GZK cut-off) corresponds to the effective threshold of pion production in the interaction of the\nUHECR protons with the CMB radiation. At similar energies, nuclei photo-dissociate on the CMB. As a consequence,\nthe horizon of the UHECR sources in the standard scenario is restricted to our local \"neighbourhood\" (\u2243 50 Mpc).\nAnalysis of arrival directions of events and study of anisotropies at small and large angular scales may further help to\ndistinguish between different types of sources, and to provide constraints on extragalactic magnetic field strength and the\nUHECR primary particle charge.\nThe composition studies are of crucial importance for the test of the UHECR production models. For example, limits\non the photon fraction at the highest energies may constrain strongly exotic UHECR models. Measurements of shower\nproperties in the atmosphere (depth of the maximum of cascade) and at the ground (thickness and curvature of the\nshower front, muon richness etc.) are confronted with simulations to provide necessary discrimination criteria. Another\nimportant issue of these studies is to understand the systematic difference in energy measurement between previous\nresults obtained using different experimental techniques: from the particle density at the ground (AGASA), or from the\nfluorescence (HiRes) or Cherenkov (Yakutsk) emission triggered by UHECR-induced showers in the atmosphere.\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory was designed [2, 3] to answer these key questions of the UHECR physics. The project\naims at large aperture (> 7000 km2 sr above 1019 eV) hybrid detection (combining air fluorescence and ground particle\ntechniques) of the highest energy cosmic rays with the full-sky exposure (with 1 site per hemisphere). After presenting\nthe Southern Auger site and its current status, we will describe the first Auger results on the UHECR spectrum, anisotropy\nstudies, and the limit on the photon contents in the cosmic rays.\n\n2. The Pierre Auger Observatory\nThe Southern Auger site is located near Malarg\u00fce, in the Mendoza region of Argentina. Its hybrid design (see the\nfigure 1) allows the simultaneous detection of the same cosmic ray events by two complementary techniques. After\nits completion, the Auger Surface Detector (SD) will consist of 1600 12-tons water Cherenkov tanks spaced in 1.5 km\ntriangular array on the 3000 km2 area. Three photomuliplier tubes (PMTs) in each tank collect the Cherenkov light from\n\n\f2\n\nPierre Auger Collaboration\n\nFigure 1. (left) The plan of the Auger Observatory, with 1600 Surface Detector stations and 4 Fluorescence Detector sites. (right) High\nenergy hybrid event. In the upper plot, each triggered station is marked by a blue circle. The bold line is the projection of the shower\naxis on the ground, with the core near the station with maximal signal. The fluorescence detector captured the side view of the shower\n(the dotted line is the intersection of the Shower-Detector Plane with the horizontal plane containing the eye). The lower plot shows\nthe reconstructed shower longitudinal profile.\n\nthe passage of the electromagnetic and muonic components of showers through the purified water. The PMTs signals are\ndigitized at 40 MHz sampling frequency, which provides a temporal resolution of 8 ns. Signal timing information and\nthe integrated charge values are used for reconstruction of shower geometry (arrival direction and core position). Then\nan energy estimate can be obtained by comparing the lateral distribution of signal with simulations.\nThe Auger Fluorescence Detector (FD), once completed, will be composed of 4 fluorescence sites located on the edges\nof the surface array, with 6 Schmidt design telescopes per site, covering each a 30\u25e6 range in azimuth (see the figure 1)\nand 0\u25e6 \u221230\u25e6 range in elevation. Each telescope consists of 11 m2 segmented spherical mirrors (radius of curvature 3.4 m),\nfocusing the light from the 2.2 m diameter diaphragm onto a camera of 20\u00d722 PMTs. The image of a shower developing\nin the field of view of a telescope represents a track of triggered PMTs, which enables to reconstruct a shower-detector\nplane with a high precision (\u2243 0.3\u25e6 ). When, in addition to an FD telescope, one or more SD tanks participate in the\nevent (hybrid detection), the SD timing information improves considerably the shower geometry reconstruction. Then,\nwith the help of the absolute calibration of camera pixels and the knowledge of shower geometry, one can estimate the\nprimary energy from the total amount of fluorescence light. This estimate is nearly calorimetric as it is related directly to\nionization loss by electrons and positrons in the showers, and only a small correction (\u2243 10% at Auger energies) should\ntake into account the \"missing\" energy due to muons and neutrinos. An even more valuable information concerning\nenergy determination is obtained from the so-called \"Golden\" hybrid events, like that one shown in the figure 1, when\nthe same event can be reconstructed independently by the SD and the FD.\nCurrently, nearly 1000 (\u2243 60%) SD stations are fully operational, and about 200 more tanks are deployed in the pampa.\n18 out of 24 FD telescopes (3 sites) are now completed, and are taking data during clear moonless nights. More details on the Detector performances and calibration, numerous facilities for atmospheric monitoring can be found in the\nProceedings of the 29th ICRC at Pune, India (2005) (see [4] for the compilation).\n\n3. Measurement of the primary cosmic ray energy spectrum above 3 EeV\nThe data taken from 1 January 2004 to 5 June 2005 were used to make a first estimate [5] of the primary UHECR\nspectrum. While the average Auger SD array size for this period was only \u223c 22% of the planned 3000 km2 , the\n\n\f3\n\n10\n10\n\n2\n\ndI/d(lnE) [km sr yr]\n\n-1\n\nStatus and recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory\n\n-1\n-2 -1\n\n-1\n\n24\n\n2\n\n10\n\nE dI/dE( 10 eV m s sr )\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n1\n\nAGASA\nAuger\nHiRes I\nHiRes II\nYakutsk\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n19\n\n20\nLog(E)\n10\n\n-1\n\n17\n\n17.5\n\n18\n\n18.5\n\n19\n\n19.5\n\n20\n\n20.5\n\n21\n\nlog10(E/eV)\ndI\nrepresentation).

Two error bars indicate the systematic uncertainty at two different energies. (right) The measured Auger spectrum\ndI\n(in E 3 dE\nrepresentation) is superimposed on the results of the previous experiments [6, 7, 8].\n\nintegrated exposure was already similar to those by the largest previous experiments. The method used to derive the\nspectrum is almost free of any assumptions on primary UHECR composition or hadronic interaction models. It allows\nto combine the power of large SD array aperture with the nearly calorimetric FD energy measurement.\nThe energy assignment to the SD events is a two-step procedure. First, we establish for each event an energy-related\nparameter. We use for this purpose S(1000), the estimate of integrated signal size at a distance of 1000 m from the shower\naxis, which is determined from a fit of the lateral distribution of signal of all tanks triggered by the shower. Simulations\nshow that S(1000) is almost proportional to primary energy and that at these distances from the axis the fluctuations\nof lateral distribution are minimal for studied energies and adopted array geometry. The constant intensity cut method,\nwhich exploits the nearly isotropy of cosmic rays, is used to rescale S(1000) value from different shower inclinations.\nAt the second step, a rule for converting S(1000) to energy is established using a subset of high quality \"Golden\" hybrid\nevents.\nTo derive the spectrum, we used 3525 events above 3 EeV, detected at zenith angles \u03b8 < 60\u25e6 and falling within the welldefined fiducial area. The simulations (reinforced by an independent check of trigger probability with the hybrid events)\nshow that the array acceptance for such showers is 100%. Consequently, the array exposure for the selected dataset is\nsimply defined by the array geometry and the live-time of SD tanks. The spectrum, obtained by dividing the number of\nevents in energy bins by the exposure value (1750 km2 sr yr), is shown on the left plot of figure 2.\nThe large part of indicated systematic errors in energy assignment comes from the limited number of hybrid events that\nwere used to establish the S(1000) \u2013 energy conversion, especially at the highest energies. This systematics will of course\nshrink rapidly with the growing amount of data. Another large sources of systematics from the FD energy scale itself\n(\u223c 25% in total) are the uncertainty in fluorescence yield (15%) and the absolute calibration of the FD telescopes (12%).\nBoth cited uncertainty values will also be reduced in the near future. However, at this early stage of experiment, one\ncannot conclude yet on the presence of the GZK cutoff in the spectrum.\nThe measured spectrum is shown on the right plot of figure 2 with the results of previous experiments. The Auger data\n\n\f4\n\nPierre Auger Collaboration\n\nFigure 3. (left) The Auger map of CR overdensity significances near the GC region (top-hat windows of 5\u25e6 radius). The GC position\nis marked by a cross on the galactic plane.

(right) The corresponding histogram of overdensities computed on a grid\nof 3\u25e6 spacing compared to isotropic expectations (points with 2\u03c3 bounds).\n\npoints are \u223c 10% below the HiRes flux measures. It should be also noted that preliminary studies based on SD event\nsimulations provide energies that are systematically (by \u223c 25%) higher than those derived from the FD calibration. The\nPierre Auger Observatory, with its large statistics and the rich information available for each shower, will investigate this\nintriguing difference.\n\n4. Anisotropy Studies\nThe data from 1 January 2004 to 30 March 2006 were analyzed [9] to search for anisotropies near the Galactic Center\n(GC). This region represents an attractive target for such studies, as it harbors the very massive black hole, and the\ndetection of a very close TeV \u03b3-ray source by H.E.S.S. collaboration [10] had given birth to a number of theoretical\nmodels predicting the flux of neutrons at EeV energies. In addition, recent H.E.S.S. detection of the diffuse \u03b3-ray flux,\ncorrelated with the giant molecular clouds near the GC [11], has also provided the indirect evidence for the cosmic ray\nacceleration in that region, though at much lower energies. There were previous claims by the AGASA and SUGAR\ncollaborations of significant event excesses at EeV energies near to the GC, for [1\u20132.5] EeV and [0.8\u20133.2] EeV energy\nbands, respectively. The GC passes at \u223c 6\u25e6 from the zenith at the Auger South site latitude, and our dataset for the GC\nstudies (79265 SD and 3439 hybrid events with similar energies 1017.9 eV < E < 1018.5 eV) is significantly larger than\nthat of AGASA or SUGAR.\nThe figure 3 summarizes the results of our anisotropy analysis for the Galactic Center region. The relative exposure of\nthe different sky directions (coverage map) has been cross-checked using two different techniques leading to a difference\nof \u223c 0.5% in background estimate, a level well below the Poissonian fluctuations and the excesses to test. Then the\nsignificance of eventual anisotropies in the UHECR arrival direction distribution was estimated by comparison of the\nobserved number of events with that expected from an isotropic cosmic ray flux. The significance maps were built in\ncircular windows of 5\u25e6 radius. This angular scale is convenient to visualize the overdensity distributions in the windows\nstudied by SUGAR (excess size \u223c 5\u25e6 ) and AGASA (excess size \u223c 20\u25e6 ). Additional tests have been made with modified\nenergy ranges to take into account possible differences in energy calibration. In all cases, no significant excess has been\nfound in Auger data. We therefore do not confirm the excesses observed by AGASA and SUGAR.

A blind search for overdensities in the cosmic ray flux for the same energy ranges and at two angular scales\nof 5\u25e6 and 15\u25e6 has also given the results consistent with isotropy [13].\n\n5. Upper limit to the photon fraction in cosmic rays above 10 EeV\nThe Auger hybrid data from January 2004 to February 2006 were used to set a limit to the photon fraction in the UHECR\nabove 10 EeV [14]. For the first time, such a limit is obtained from direct measurement of the depth of shower maximum, Xmax . At these energies, the development of photon-induced showers is delayed by the LPM effect. Consequently,\nthe average Xmax values for photon showers are much larger (by \u2243 200 g/cm2 ) than those for hadron-induced showers\n(see the figure 4). The fluctuations of Xmax values for photon showers are also large (\u2243 80 g/cm2 at 10 EeV). At even\nhigher energies (\u2265 50 EeV for the Southern Auger site), a competing process of photon conversion into pairs in the\ngeomagnetic field (the \"preshowering\") brings the Xmax values of triggered showers and the corresponding fluctuation\nvalues closer to those for hadrons.\nThe average vertical depth of the atmosphere for the Southern Auger site is \u2243 880 g/cm2 , so the nearly vertical photon\nshowers reach the ground before their maximum development. Another consequence of the deeper shower maximum for\nphoton primaries is the stronger attenuation of their fluorescence light for the same geometry conditions, due to the larger\namount of the traversed air mass. To avoid a possible bias against photons in the detector acceptance, we have included\nin the analysis only sufficiently inclined events with limited maximal distance between FD telescope and shower impact\npoint. These requirements, in addition to general hybrid quality cuts (good geometry and profile reconstruction, shower\nmaximum observed, no clouds), assure that the acceptance ratio between photons and hadrons is not less than 80%. The\nenergy of the events has been calculated under assumption of their photon origin, i.e. the missing energy correction was\nonly \u2243 1% due to the smallness of the photo-nuclear production cross-section.\n29 hybrid events with energies above 10 EeV satisfy the selection criteria (one of them is the \"Golden\" hybrid event\nshown on the figure 1). 100 photon showers were simulated for each of the real events, using the reconstructed event\nparameters as the input. The average Xmax values for simulated events are considerably (in the [2\u03c3; 3.8\u03c3] range) larger\nthan those for the selected events. This allowed us to derive an upper limit f\u03b3ul on the photon fraction.\n\n\f6\n\nPierre Auger Collaboration\n\nThe calculation of the limit is based on the statistical method taking into account uncertainties \u2206Xmax in the determination of the depth of shower maximum. The main contributions to \u2206Xmax come from the uncertainties in the event\ngeometry, longitudinal profile reconstruction and atmospheric absorption. There are also photon-specific systematic uncertainties in the Xmax value, resulting from the uncertainty in the extrapolation of the photo-nuclear production cross\nsection, or from the uncertainty in the reconstructed energy (non-negligible due to the larger elongation rate for photons,\nsee the figure 4). However, the shower fluctuations for photons are considerably larger when compared to our conservative estimates of the statistical (\u2243 28 g/cm2 ) and systematic (\u2243 23 g/cm2 ) uncertainties in the Xmax measurement. As\na consequence, the f\u03b3ul value is limited mainly by the event statistics.\nFor the selected data sample, the upper limit to the photon fraction is 16% at the 95% confidence level. The Auger limit,\nshown on the figure 4, confirms and improves the previous limits obtained by the ground arrays. In the future, the larger\ndatasets will allow to reduce this upper limit value, and to constrain strongly non-acceleration UHECR models with new\nupper limits at higher energies. An order of magnitude larger Surface Detector statistics will also be exploited for the\nphoton limit studies.\n\n6. Conclusions and future prospects\nThe first results from the Pierre Auger Observatory, though obtained with the incomplete detector over the first two\nyears of operation out of 20 years planned, have already brought important new insights on the UHECR physics and\ndemonstrated the power of Auger large aperture and hybrid design. There are many advances in the understanding of the\ndetector response. To access to the large panorama of the Auger activities and results, the reader is invited to consult the\n29th ICRC Proceedings [4] and the more recent publications.\nWhile the Southern Auger site is still under construction, a preparation work for the Northern site with even larger\naperture in Colorado is on-going. At the same time, possible enhancements of the Southern site, that will allow to bring\nthe energy threshold of the detector down to 1017 eV and to measure with higher precision the UHECR composition in\nthe region where the transition from galactic to extragalactic component occurs, are discussed. Several options for such\nenhancements are envisaged, like higher elevation angle FD telescopes, muon counters, and additional surface detectors\nspaced more closely (in-fill array). There are also planned R & D on shower radio detection. We expect therefore with a\nreasonable optimism that many of the key questions that have been mentioned above will be answered in the near future.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nA.M.
