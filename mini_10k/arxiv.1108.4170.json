Introduction\nA theoretical description of the neutron-proton (np)\nsystem makes it possible to understand the nuclear\nstructure. The nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering is traditionally described in terms of the meson-nucleon theory at low and medium energies. The one-boson exchange (realistic) potential plays a predominant role in\nthis case. At higher energies, production processes and\ninelasticities become important, and systems composed\nof nucleons and mesons contribute to the NN scattering.\nAt present there is no quantitative description of the NN\nscattering above the inelastic threshold neither in terms\nof QCD nor of meson and nucleon degrees of freedom.\nThere have been several theoretical attempts built\nwithin boson exchange models to explain NN scattering data up to 1 GeV. All of them describe observables\nperfectly for energies up to 300 MeV. However, using\nboson exchange potentials at higher energies gives only\na qualitative agreement with experimental data. Optical\nmodel studies have been suggested for the medium and\nhigh energy NN scattering [1, 2]. They give a quantitative agreement with the experimental data for the NN\n\nscattering and Bremsstrahlung within the wide energy\nrange.\nThe Bethe-Salpeter (BS) approach [3, 4], as a fourdimensional covariant formalism, is the most appropriate to study the NN interaction. It is convenient to use a\nseparable ansatz [4] for the interaction kernel in the BS\nequation in this picture. Papers [5, 6] have suggested\nmultirank separable potentials to describe the np scattering with the total angular momentum J = 0, 1 and the\ndeuteron. The obtained potentials can describe all available experimental data for the phase shifts, static properties of the deuteron, and the exclusive electron-deuteron\nbreakup in the plane-wave approximation [5, 6, 7].\nHowever, it is important to investigate the influence\nof the inelastisity in the elastic NN scattering. We describe the inelasticity using a complex NN potential of a\nspecial type [8] instead of the real-valued one obtained\nearlier in Refs. [5, 6]. The method has been successfully\nused for the description of the uncoupled partial-wave\nstates of the np system with the total angular momentum J = 0, 1. Now we apply it to construct the complex\npotential for the coupled 3 S 1+ -3 D+1 partial-wave state.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.2, the\n\n\fS.G. Bondarenko et al. / Nuclear Physics B Proceedings Supplement 00 (2018) 1\u20134\n\nparametrization of the scattering matrix is described.\nThe used complex separable interaction kernel is considered in Sec.3. The procedure which we apply to find\nnew imaginary interaction kernel parameters and the obtained parameters are presented in Sec.4. The discussion and conclusion are given in Sec.5.\n2. Parametrization of the S matrix\nFollowing Arndt et al. [9], we prefer to use the\nparametrization of the K matrix rather than the scattering matrix S :\nK=i\n\n1\u2212S\n= ReK + iImK,\n1+S\n\n(1)\n\nwhere K is a 2\u00d72 matrix for the coupled partial-wave\nstate. The real part ReK is represented as\nReK = i\n\n1 \u2212 Se\n,\n1 + Se\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nSe =\n\n2i\u03b4<\n\ncos 2\u03b51 e\ni sin 2\u03b51 ei(\u03b4< +\u03b4> )\n\ni(\u03b4< +\u03b4> )\n\ni sin 2\u03b51 e\ncos 2\u03b51 e2i\u03b4>\n\n!\n\n2\n\ntan \u03c1<\ntan \u03c1< tan \u03c1> cos \u03bc\n\ntan \u03c1< tan \u03c1> cos \u03bc\ntan2 \u03c1>\n\nT l0 l (p00 , |p0 |; p0 , |p|; s) =\n\n(5)\n+\u221e\n\u221e\nZ\nZ\ni X\nVl0 l (p00 , |p0 |; p0 , |p|; s) + 3\ndk0 k2 d|k| \u00d7\n4\u03c0 l00\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\nVl0 l00 (p00 , |p0 |; k0 , |k|; s) T l00 l (k0 , |k|; p0 , |p|; s)\n.\n\u221a\n( s/2 \u2212 Ek + i\u000f)2 \u2212 k02\n\nThe square of the np pair total momentum s is related\nwith the laboratory energy T Lab as: s = 2mT Lab + 4m2 ,\nm is the mass of the nucleon.\nTo describe the inelasticity in the elastic NN scattering, we modify the real-valued relativistic potential\nadding the imaginary part:\nVr \u2192 V = Vr + iVi .\n\nTo solve the Eq.(5), the separable (rank N) ansatz [4]\nfor the NN interaction kernel is used:\nVl0 l (p00 , |p0 |; p0 , |p|; s) =\n(6)\nN\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n0\n\u03bbrmn (s) + i\u03bbimn (s) g[li ] (p00 , |p0 |)g[l]\nj (p0 , |p|),\nm,n=1\n\n(3)\n\nis the well-known Stapp parametrization [10] for the\nelastic NN scattering matrix. Here \u03b4< = \u03b4L=J\u22121 , \u03b4> =\n\u03b4L=J+1 are phase shifts of 3 S 1+ and 3 D+1 states, respectively, and \u03b51 is a mixing parameter. The ImK is given\nby\nImK =\n\n2\n\n(4)\n!\n\nin terms of the inelasticity parameters \u03c1<,> , \u03bc corresponding to the states with the orbital momenta L =\nJ \u2212 1, J + 1, and \u03b51 respectively.\n3. Complex separable kernel\nWe assume that the interaction kernel V conserves\nparity, the total angular momentum J and its projection, and isotopic spin. Due to the tensor nuclear force,\nthe orbital angular momentum L is not conserved. The\nnegative-energy two-nucleon states are switched off,\nwhat leads to the total spin S conservation. The partialwave-decomposed BS equation in the center-of-mass\nsystem of the np pair is therefore reduced to the following form:\n\nwhere the imaginary part \u03bbi has the following form [8]:\n\u0012\nsth \u0013 i\n\u03bbimn (s) = \u03b8(s \u2212 sth ) 1 \u2212\n\u03bb\u0304 ,\n(7)\ns mn\n\ni\nr\ng[l]\nj are model functions, \u03bbmn = \u03bbmn + i\u03bbmn is a matrix\nof model parameters and sth is an inelasticity threshold\nvalue (the first energy point where the inelasticity becomes nonzero). In this case, the resulting T matrix has\na similar separable form:\n\nT l0 l (p00 , |p0 |; p0 , |p|; s) =\nN\nX\n0\n\u03c4mn (s)g[li ] (p00 , |p0 |)g[l]\nj (p0 , |p|),\n\n(8)\n\nm,n=1\n\nwhere\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121 \u0012\n\u03c4mn (s) = \u03bbrmn (s) + i\u03bbimn (s) + hmn (s),\n\n(9)\n\nhmn (s) =\n(10)\nZ\nZ\n[l]\n[l]\nX\ni\ng (k0 , |k|)gn (k0 , |k|)\n\u2212 3\ndk0 k2 d|k| \u221am\n.\n4\u03c0 l\n( s/2 \u2212 Ek + i\u000f)2 \u2212 k02\n\nr\nThe functions g[l]\nm and the parameters \u03bb coincide with\ni\nthose used in Ref. [6] while \u03bb are new parameters which\nare calculated.\nThus, we introduce the imaginary part Vi of the potential V (6) adding the new parameters \u03bbi to the real\npart Vr which is left unchanged. It allows us to describe the additional inelasticity parameters by a minimal change of the previous kernel [6].\n\n\fS.G.

Calculations and results\n3\n\nS 1+ -3 D+1\n\nThe description of the inelastic part in the\nstate is performed in the same way as in our previous\npaper [8] for the uncoupled partial-wave states. We start\nfrom the real-valued rank-six interaction kernel MY6\n[6] obtained from the description of low-energy characteristics and phase shifts for the laboratory energies T Lab\nup to 1.1 GeV whose experimental values were taken\nfrom the SAID program [11]. The parameters of the\nreal part are fixed. Then \u03bbi are calculated to give a correct behavior of the inelasticity parameters \u03c1< , \u03c1> . The\nexperimental data for them can be taken from the SAID\nprogram.\nThe minimization procedure for the function\n\u03c72 =\n\nn\nX\nX\n\nexp\n\nexp\n\n(\u03b4l (sm ) \u2212 \u03b4l (sm ))2 /(\u2206\u03b4l (sm ))2\n\nm=mth l=<,>\n\nexp\n\nexp\n\n+(\u03c1l (sm ) \u2212 \u03c1l (sm ))2 /(\u2206\u03c1l (sm ))2 (11)\n\nis used. Here n is the number of available experimental\npoints, mth is the number of the data point corresponding\nto the first nonzero \u03c1 value. It is defined by the threshold\nkinetic energy T Lab th which is taken from the singleenergy analysis [11].\nThe resulting parameters \u03bbi are listed in Table 11 . In\nFigs.1-3, the results of the phase shift, inelasticity parameter and mixing parameter calculations (MYI6 - red\ndashed line) are compared with the experimental data,\nour previous result without inelasticities [6] (MY6 - red\nsolid line; only for the phase shifts and the mixing parameter), the SP07 solution [12] (green dashed-dotted\nline) and the optical potential FGA [2] (blue dasheddotted-dotted line).\n\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nThe obtained phase shifts and inelasticity parameter\nfor the 3 S 1+ partial-wave state are presented in Fig.1. We\nsee that all considered calculations (MY6, MYI6, SP07,\nFGA) give an excellent description of all available experimental data for phase shifts and are quite similar to\neach other for T Lab up to 2 GeV. However, MYI6 model\nphase shifts suddenly change their behavior at the laboratory energy T Lab & 2 GeV, which becomes similar to\nFGA (see also SM97, FA00 and SP00 solutions [13]).\nTherefore, to understand whether this behavior means\n1 We would like to note misprints in Tables 2 and 3 [6] where \u03bb\u0304\n(GeV2 ) should be read as \u03bb\u0304 (GeV4 ).\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Parameters \u03bb\u0304i of the rank-six kernel MYI6 for the coupled\n3 S + -3 D+ state.\n1\n1\n\n\u03bb\u0304i11 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i12 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i13 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i14 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i15 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i16 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i22 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i23 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i24 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i25 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i26 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i33 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i34 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i35 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i36 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i44 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i45 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i46 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i55 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i56 (GeV2 )\n\u03bb\u0304i66 (GeV2 )\nT Lab th (GeV)\n\n-366.6091\n128.6970\n-0.3089566\n-68.07828\n64.67047\n-11.51058\n68.53852\n3.129745\n458.8815\n2669.315\n11.35009\n-2.395499\n15.130951\n-55.78875\n0.4364534\n411.3334\n3280.671\n-11.29448\n5685.375\n-44.92390\n-0.07438475\n0.4\n\nsome physical effect or the model needs to be improved,\nthe experimental data at T Lab >1.1 GeV are necessary.\nThe descrpition of the inelasticity parameter is perfect\nfor the MYI6, FGA potentials and the SP07 solution\nfor T Lab up to 1.1 GeV where the experimental data are\navailable and they are different at higher energies.\nFig.2 shows the results of the calculations for the 3 D+1\nstate.
