ETHOS 1 stands out as one of the few PNe to have both\npolar outflows (jets) travelling at 120 \u00b1 10 km/s and a close binary central star. The\nlightcurve observed with the Mercator telescope reveals an orbital period of 0.535 days\nand an extremely large amplitude (0.816 mag) due to irradiation of the companion\nby a very hot pre-white dwarf. ETHOS 1 further strengthens the long suspected link\nbetween binary central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) and jets. INT IDS and VLT\nFORS spectroscopy of the CSPN reveals weak N III, C III and C IV emission lines\nseen in other close binary CSPN and suggests many CSPN with these weak emission\nlines are misclassified close binaries. We present VLT FORS imaging and Manchester\nEchelle Spectrometer long slit observations from which a kinematic model of the nebula\nis built. An unusual combination of bipolar outflows and a spherical nebula conspire to\nproduce an X-shaped appearance. The kinematic age of the jets (1750 \u00b1 250 yrs/kpc)\nare found to be older than the inner nebula (900\u00b1100 yrs/kpc) consistent with previous\nstudies of similar PNe. Emission line ratios of the jets are found to be consistent\nwith reverse-shock models for fast low-ionisation emitting regions (FLIERS) in PNe.\nFurther large-scale surveys for close binary CSPN will be required to securely establish\nwhether FLIERS are launched by close binaries.\nKey words: planetary nebulae: individual: PN G068.1+11.0 - binaries: close - stars:\nwinds, outflows - ISM: jets and outflows\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the protracted debate on the shaping mechanisms of PNe\n(Balick & Frank 2002) appropriate solutions are sought to\nexplain both the dominant nebula morphology (e.g. spherical, elliptical, bipolar; Balick 1987) and the accompanying\ncollimated outflows or 'jets'.

Highly axisymmetric or\nbipolar nebulae (Corradi & Schwarz 1995) have been modelled with some success including the generalised interacting stellar wind model (GISW; Kwok, Purton & Fitzgerald\n1978; Kwok 2000) and a combination of stellar rotation and\nmagnetic fields (e.g. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura 1997). There are however fundamental limitations in both of these models. The\nGISW model depends upon an assumed density contrast\nto produce bipolar PNe (e.g. a dusty torus) and the latter\ncannot operate without an additional supply of angular momentum (e.g. a binary companion; Soker 2006; Nordhaus,\n\n\f2\n\nB. Miszalski et al.\n\nBlackman & Frank 2007). While there are multiple advantages to a binary explanation over existing theories, we are\nonly beginning to understand the prevalence and impact of\nbinarity in PNe (De Marco 2009; Miszalski et al. 2009a,\n2009b, 2010).\nDecisive observational evidence is required to advance\nthe shaping debate which is imbalanced towards theoretical\nmodels. PNe with dusty disks seem to support the GISW\nmodel though there appears to be a strong dependence on a\nbinary companion for their formation (Chesneau 2010). Similarly, magnetic fields are difficult to observe directly in PNe\n(Jordan et al. 2005; Sabin et al. 2007), yet they appear to be\nmore influential as part of a binary-driven dynamos (Nordhaus & Blackman 2006; Nordhaus et al. 2007). Evidence\nfor close binary central stars of PNe (CSPN) that passed\nthrough a common-envelope (CE) phase is now firmly established and gaining considerable momentum with at least\n40 now known (Miszalski et al. 2009a, 2010; De Marco et al.\n2008). These make up at least 17\u00b15% of all CSPN (Miszalski\net al. 2009a; Bond 2000).\nWith a larger sample of 30 post-CE nebulae Miszalski\net al. (2009b) found at least 30%, perhaps 60\u201370%, of postCE binaries had bipolar nebulae suggesting the CE phase\npreferentially shapes bipolar nebulae. This is a substantial\nimprovement over the study of Bond & Livio (1990) whose\nsample of around a dozen close binaries showed no clear\nmorphological trends. High resolution kinematics of nebulae\naround post-CE CSPN have shown a tendency for matched\norbital and nebulae inclinations that strengthen the connection between the binary and its nebula (e.g. Mitchell et al.\n1997; Jones et al. 2010). Further progress in this aspect will\nrequire a statistically significant sample of post-CE nebulae to be identified and studied in detail to reveal trends\nbestowed upon the nebula during the CE phase (Miszalski\net al. 2010). Miszalski et al. (2009b) made the first steps\nin this direction by finding a propensity for low-ionisation\nstructures (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2001) amongst post-CE nebulae\neither in the orbital plane as a ring (e.g. Sab 41, Miszalski\net al. 2009b; the Necklace, Corradi et al. 2010) and in the\npolar direction as jets (e.g. A 63, Mitchell et al. 2007).\nJets occur in a wide variety of astrophysical objects including PNe in which they are the least understood (Livio\n1997). The connection between jets and binarity has long\nbeen suspected (Soker & Livio 1994) but never proven given\nthe paucity of known PNe with jets and binary CSPN. Jets\nin PNe typically have low outflow velocities (\u223c100 km/s),\nbut higher velocities of 200\u2013300 km/s are not uncommon,\ne.g. M 1-16 (Schwarz 1992; Corradi & Schwarz 1993), NGC\n6337 (Corradi et al. 2000) and NGC 2392 (Gieseking, Becker\n& Solf 1985), and can even reach 630 km/s in the case of\nMyCn 18 (O'Connor et al. 2000). There is no strong evidence for highly collimated outflows (e.g. Herbig-Haro-like\noutflows) in genuine PNe and Frew & Parker (2010) suggest the few objects with the most collimated outflows are\ninstead related to B[e] stars. The most striking example is\nHen 2-90 (Sahai & Nyman 2000) which was later reclassified\nas a B[e] star (Kraus et al. 2005; Frew & Parker 2010).\nInstead, jets in PNe manifest as point-symmetric\n'corkscrew'-like outflows (L\u00f3pez et al. 1993; V\u00e1zquez et al.\n2008) or as pairs of opposing knots often called fast lowionisation emitting regions (FLIERS; see e.g. Balick et al.\n1987, 1993; Dopita 1997) with notable examples being Hb 4\n\n(L\u00f3pez et al. 1997; Harrington & Borkowski 2000; Miszalski\net al. 2009b), NGC 6337 (Corradi et al. 2000; Garc\u0131\u0301a-D\u0131\u0301az\net al. 2009), A 63 (Mitchell et al. 2007), IC 4634 (Guerrero\net al. 2008), IC 4673 (Kovacevic et al. 2010), Sab 41 (Miszalski et al. 2009b) and the Necklace (Corradi et al. 2010).\nFurther examples are listed by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2001) and\nHarrington & Borkowski (2000).\nPoint-symmetric jets have received the most attention\nin the literature with models consisting of an episodic precessing jet powered by an accretion disk in a wide binary\nwith Porb \u223ca few years (e.g. Raga, Cant\u00f3 & Biro 1993; Cliffe\net al. 1995; Haro-Corzo et al. 2009; Raga et al. 2009). Precession helps smear out or widen the jet and may also explain the often 'bent' position of jets with respect to the\npresumed major axis (e.g. Hb 4 and Sab 41). Some jets appear in two pairs (e.g. NGC 6337) and these may have arose\nfrom multiple ejections (e.g. Nordhaus & Blackman 2006).\nA similar scenario involves a short-lived 'wobbling' accretion disk (Livio & Pringle 1996, 1997; Icke 2003) and models with magnetic fields have also successfully been applied\nto the problem (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura 1997). Dynamical lifetimes\nof jets suggest they are ejected well before the main nebula\n(Mitchell et al. 2007; Corradi et al. 2010), i.e. before the CE\nis ejected if a close binary is present, and this is consistent\nwith the short-lived nature of the modelled accretion disks.\nThe most constructive way to establish the link between\njets and binaries is to look for binary CSPN in a large sample of PNe with jets. This is one of the major aims behind our ongoing program to look for close binary CSPN\nvia the photometric monitoring technique (Miszalski et al.\n2010). We are also targeting bipolar PNe and through nondetections we will also be able to discern whether larger\norbital periods produce point-symmetric jets rather than\nFLIERS. The program has been very successful so far with\nat least five close binary CSPN found using the 1.2-m Flemish Mercator telescope. These include the Necklace and its\nSupernova 1987A-like ring (Corradi et al. 2010), the Type\nIa supernova candidate double-degenerate nucleus of Hen 2428 (Santander-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2010), and the subject of this\npaper, ETHOS 1.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 introduces the\nnew survey responsible for the discovery of ETHOS 1 and\nthe spectroscopic confirmation of its PN status. Spectroscopic and photometric evidence for binarity are presented\nin Sec. 3. The nebula is examined in Sec. 4 with narrow-band\nimages, high-resolution spectroscopy. Sec. 4.2 examines diagnostic emission line ratios of the jets and we conclude in\nSec. 5.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDISCOVERY AND PN CONFIRMATION\nThe Extremely Turquoise Halo Object Survey\n(ETHOS)\n\nBeyond the confines of Galactic Plane H\u03b1 surveys (Parker\net al. 2005; Drew et al. 2005) there are very few PNe currently known as less than 9% of \u223c2800 Galactic PNe are\nlocated at latitudes |b| & 10\u25e6 . Most of these were found\nfrom visual inspection of photographic broadband sky survey plates (e.g. Kohoutek 1963; Abell 1966; Longmore 1977;\nWeinberger 1977; Longmore & Tritton 1980; Hartl & Tritton 1985). With the digitisation of the same material it is\n\n\fETHOS 1\nnow possible to extend this work to lower surface brightnesses and to systematically search larger areas more efficiently (Jacoby et al. 2010). The MASH-II project (Miszalski et al. 2008) demonstrated that visual searches for PNe\nare largely insensitive to compact or star-like PNe. Several\ncompact PNe were found from catalogue queries of the SuperCOSMOS H\u03b1 Survey (Parker et al. 2005) including the\nMASH-II PN MPA 1327-6031 that lies just near the outer\nlobe of the bipolar MASH PN PHR 1327-6032 (Parker et\nal. 2006). The number of distant (compact) Halo PNe is\ntherefore essentially unknown. Further discoveries are essential to determine whether Halo PNe can only be formed\nvia close binary evolution (Bond 2000) as there is currently\nonly a small amount of supporting evidence (e.g. Pe\u00f1a &\nRuiz 1998; Tovmassian et al. 2010)\nThe Extremely Turquoise Halo Object Survey (ETHOS,\nMiszalski et al. in prep) is a new survey designed to find\nhigh-latitude compact PNe that would ordinarily be missed\nby visual searches. ETHOS is essentially an extension to\nbroadband colours of the MASH-II catalogue search applied to the whole sky (excluding the H\u03b1 surveyed regions).\nCurrently four candidate PNe have been spectroscopically\nconfirmed out of a few dozen candidates identified solely\nfrom queries of the SuperCOSMOS Science Archive (SSA,\nHambly et al. 2004), a convenient SQL interface to the entire database of catalogue data generated during the digitisation of SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey data (Hambly et al.\n2001b). Candidates are then visualised as for MASH-II, but\nthis time replacing the primary colour-composite H\u03b1 (red),\nSR (green) and BJ (blue) image with an IN (red), RF\n(green) and BJ (blue) image (Reid et al. 1991; Hambly et\nal. 2001a). The IRB image is particularly effective in distinguishing PNe apart from other objects since they often\nappear with a strong turquoise hue. Figure 1 best shows the\nturquoise false-colour in the discovery image of ETHOS 1,\nthe first PN candidate identified during the design phase\nof ETHOS (Miszalski 2009). The object was selected based\non the colours of the inner nebula but the presence of faint\nextensions either side made it stand out amongst the other\ncandidates. Further details of the survey and initial results\nwill be presented elsewhere (Miszalski et al. in prep).\n2.2\n\nSpectroscopic confirmation of ETHOS 1\n\nETHOS 1 was observed during Isaac Newton Telescope\n(INT) service time with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) on 10 March 2009. The R300V grating was\nused at a central wavelength of 5400 \u00c5 to provide wavelength coverage from 3300\u20138000 \u00c5 at a dispersion of 1.87\n\u00c5/pixel. The spectrograph slit was placed along the jets at\na position angle (PA) of 149\u25e6 and its width of 1.0\u2032\u2032 gave a resolution of 5 \u00c5 (FWHM) at 5400 \u00c5. One 30 minute exposure\nwas taken at an airmass of 1.51 followed by a 30 s exposure\nof the spectrophotometric standard star HD 192281 at an\nairmass of 1.72 with an 8\u2032\u2032 slit. Standard reductions were\nperformed with IRAF and four different extractions corresponding to different nebula regions were made using the\nIRAF task apall. The stellar continuum of the CSPN was\ntraced to guide the extractions. Aperture sizes used were 6\npixels for the CSPN (2.4\u2032\u2032 ), 54 pixels for the inner nebula\n(21.6\u2032\u2032 , which includes the CSPN), 19 pixels for the SE jet\n(7.6\u2032\u2032 ) and 23 pixels for the NW jet (9.2\u2032\u2032 ). The jet extrac-\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Discovery image of ETHOS 1 made from IN (red),\nRF (green) and BJ (blue) POSS-II SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey\nimages (Reid et al. 1991; Hambly et al. 2001a).

The extractions were then flux calibrated in the\nstandard fashion with the aforementioned standard.\nFigure 2 shows the IDS spectra that confirm the PN nature of ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1+11.0) whose basic properties\nare given in Tab. 1. We measured c, the logarithmic extinction at H\u03b2, to be 0.18 using the Howarth (1983) reddening\nlaw and Te = 17700 K (Sec. 4.2). The high ratio of He II\n\u03bb4686/H\u03b2 & 1.1 in the main nebula is typical of very high\nexcitation PNe at high Galactic latitudes in which all the helium is doubly ionised giving a mass-bounded, optically thin\nnebula (Kaler 1981; Kaler & Jacoby 1989). Similar emission\nline intensities are also found in the post-CE PNe K 1-2\n(Exter et al. 2003) and the Necklace (Corradi et al. 2010),\nbut in our case we do not find any low-ionisation species in\nthe main nebula perhaps suggesting a slightly higher CSPN\ntemperature. The only low-ionisation species are found in\nthe tips of the jets which are caused by shocks (Sec. 4.2).\nBesides the [Ne V] and [Ar V] emission found close to the\nhot CSPN, the CSPN spectrum also shows C III \u03bb4650, C\nIV \u03bb5801, \u03bb5812 and \u03bb7726 as the signature of an irradiated\nclose companion (Sec. 3.1).\n\n\f4\n\nB. Miszalski et al.\n\nFigure 2. INT IDS spectroscopy of ETHOS 1. No nebular subtraction was made for the CSPN spectrum.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTHE BINARY CENTRAL STAR\nAn irradiated spectroscopic binary\n\nETHOS 1 was also observed with the FORS2 instrument\n(Appenzeller et al. 1998) under the VLT visitor mode program 083.D-0654(A) on 14 July 2009. The objective of this\nprogram was to measure the radial velocity curves of binaries\ndiscovered by Miszalski et al. (2009a), however inclement\nweather forced the execution of a backup program in which\nETHOS 1 was included. The blue optimised E2V detector\nfrom FORS1 was used in combination with the 1200g grism\nto give continuous wavelength coverage from 4058\u20135556 \u00c5.\nThe CCD was readout with 2 \u00d7 2 binning to give a dispersion of 0.72 \u00c5/pixel, a spatial resolution of 0.252\u2032\u2032 /pixel and\na resolution measured from arc lines of 1.57 \u00c5 (FWHM) at\n4800 \u00c5.\nA 40 minute spectrum of ETHOS 1 was obtained at an\nairmass of 2.04 and the seeing varied between 1.0\u20131.3\u2032\u2032 under\nthin-thick cloud (relative flux rms up to 0.07) limiting the\nSNR in the continuum to \u223c40 near He II \u03bb4686. The 0.7\u2032\u2032 slit\nwas placed at PA = 144\u25e6 to cover the jets but because of the\ngap between FORS chips not all of the NW jet was observed.\nThe spectroscopic data were processed using the ESO FORS\npipeline and the iraf task apall was used to make three\nextractions using the CSPN continuum as a reference. These\nwere 8 pixels for the CSPN (2.0\u2032\u2032 ), 84 pixels for the inner\nnebula (21.2\u2032\u2032 , which includes the CSPN) and 70 pixels for\n\nthe SE jet (17.6\u2032\u2032 ). The jet extraction widths were measured\nfrom the jet tips inward towards the CSPN. Each spectrum\nwas flux calibrated using a 300s exposure of the CSPN of\nNGC 7293 (Oke 1990) obtained at the end of the same night\nat an airmass of 1.27 and a slit width of 0.7\u2032\u2032 . The final\nspectra are depicted in Fig. 3.\nFeatures identified in the IDS and FORS CSPN spectra\nare typical of an irradiated close binary CSPN (Pollacco &\nBell 1993, 1994). The hot primary is revealed by He II \u03bb4686,\n\u03bb5412 in absorption and the primary is irradiating a mainsequence companion to produce N III (\u03bb4634.14, \u03bb4640.64),\nC III (\u03bb4647.42, \u03bb4650.25) and C IV (\u03bb4658.30, \u03bb5801.33,\n5811.98, \u03bb7726.20) emission lines. These lines originate from\nthe irradiated zone on the side of the companion facing the\nprimary and therefore serve as a proxy for the motion of\nthe secondary. However, it should be noted that these lines\nsample the centre of light and not the centre of mass of the\nsecondary (e.g. Exter et al. 2003).\nTo measure any shifts present we used the [O III] and\nH\u03b2 emission lines of our FORS spectrum of the inner nebula\nas a reference. The systemic heliocentric velocity of the inner\nnebula was set to be Vsys = \u221220 km/s from higher resolution\nspectroscopy (Sec. 4.1). The N III \u03bb4640.64, C III \u03bb4647.42,\n\u03bb4650.25, and C IV \u03bb4658.30 emission lines gave an average\nVsec = \u2212122.0 \u00b1 4.6 km/s. Estimating Vpri is much more\ndifficult given the prominent nebular He II emission but the\nHe II \u03bb4686 absorption line is present (albeit at low S/N,\n\n\fETHOS 1\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. VLT FORS spectroscopy of ETHOS 1. No nebular subtraction was made for the rectified CSPN spectrum.\n\nFig. 3) and redshifted compared to the nebula velocity. The\nexact line profile centre is difficult to establish given the\nnebular emission and the chance that the line core may be\npartially filled in by irradiated emission. The large uncertainty means we can only estimate Vpri \u223c 105 \u00b1 80 km/s.\nOur single epoch spectrum therefore confirms the presence of\na spectroscopic binary with both components well separated\nfrom each other and the nebula. Given the large uncertainty\nin Vpri and the lack of a well-sampled radial velocity curve\nit is premature to estimate the masses of each component\nat this stage.\nAn important corollary is that the presence of the N\nIII, C III and C IV emission lines alone would ordinarily be\nsufficient grounds for a weak emission line star or wels classification (Tylenda et al. 1993; Marcolino & Ara\u00fajo 2003).\nThe wels are a heterogeneous class of CSPN that are poorly\ndefined (Fogel, De Marco & Jacoby 2003) and do not fit wellestablished classification schemes (M\u00e9ndez 1991; Crowther\net al. 1998; Acker & Neiner 2003). According to Tylenda\net al. (1993), wels are identified by (i) C IV \u03bb5801, 5812\nweaker and narrower than in [WC] CSPN, (ii) very weak or\nundetectable C III \u03bb5696, and (iii) the emission complex at\n\u03bb 4650. However, this is exactly what is observed in many\nclose binary CSPN with the best examples being Abell 46\n(Pollacco & Bell 1994), ETHOS 1 (Fig. 3) and the Necklace\n(Corradi et al. 2010). Many wels are therefore likely to be\n\nmisclassified close binaries (Miszalski 2009). Further examples will be presented elsewhere and we expect further high\nresolution spectroscopic observations of so-called wels will\nidentify further close binaries.\n\n3.2\n\nLightcurve\n\nTime series photometry of ETHOS 1 was obtained with\nthe MEROPE camera (Davignon et al. 2004) on the 1.2m semi-robotic Flemish Mercator Telescope (Raskin et al.\n2004) from 24 August 2009 to 4 September 2009. Figure 4\nshows the lightcurve phased with our ephemeris: HJD (min.\nI) = 2455076.0312\u00b10.0007 + (0.53512\u00b10.00019) E. The IDS\nand FORS spectra taken earlier during the same year covered phases 0.40\u20130.44 and 0.80\u20130.85, respectively. As for the\nNecklace, the observed periodic variability is clear evidence\nof binarity. A sine fit to the lightcurve gives a very high amplitude of 0.816 mag that indicates a very hot primary irradiating a cool main-sequence companion (see e.g. Fig. 1 of De\nMarco et al. 2008). Such a large amplitude places ETHOS 1\namongst a small group of post-CE binaries showing extreme\nirradiation effects with only Sab 41 having a larger amplitude (I = 0.849 mag, Miszalski et al. 2009a). The next\nlargest amplitudes are found in the Necklace (I = 0.747\nmag, Corradi et al. 2010) and K 1-2 (V = 0.680 mag, Exter al. 2003). There are no other post-CE binaries without\n\n\f6\n\nB. Miszalski et al.\n\nvisible nebulae that come close to these extreme amplitudes\nsimply because they have evolved significantly further along\nthe white dwarf cooling track (Aungwerojwit et al. 2007;\nShimansky et al. 2009).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nTHE NEBULA\nMorphology and Kinematics\n\nNarrow-band images of 300 s duration each were obtained\nduring the VLT visitor mode program 085.D-0629(A) on\n19 June 2010 with the FORS H Alpha+83, OIII+50 and\nOII+44 filters. The central wavelengths and full widths\nat half maximum (FWHM) of each filter are 656.3/6.1\nnm, 500.1/5.7 nm and 377.6/6.5 nm, respectively. Note the\nH Alpha+83 filter includes the [N II] \u03bb6548, \u03bb6583 emission lines. Figure 5 presents a montage of the images which\nshow three components to ETHOS 1: (i) The main nebula\n19.4\u2032\u2032 across measured at 10% of the peak H\u03b1 intensity, (ii)\nthe jets measuring 62.6\u2032\u2032 tip-to-tip also at 10% of the peak\nH\u03b1 intensity, and (iii) a faint bipolar outflow best visible in\n[O III] (Fig. 5c).\nThe absence of an inner ring of low-ionisation structures\n(LIS) sets ETHOS 1 apart from the other nebulae surrounding high-amplitude close binaries including K 1-2 (Exter et\nal. 2003), Sab 41 (Miszalski et al. 2009b) and the Necklace\n(Corradi et al. 2010). As the UV radiation field is comparably high in the other objects this may indicate the ring never\nexisted rather than recent ablation of an LIS ring. There are\nin fact no low-ionisation species detected in ETHOS 1 except for in the shocked jet tips described in Sec 4.2. A faint\ndetection in the [O II] image is due to the nebula continuum\nsince there is no [N II], [S II] or [O II] emission recorded by\nour INT spectrum of the main nebula (Fig. 2).\nSpatially resolved long slit echelle spectra of ETHOS 1\nwere made using the second Manchester Echelle Spectrometer on the 2.1-m San Pedro M\u00e1rtir Telescope (Meaburn et\nal. 2003). The primary spectral mode was used with narrowband filters to isolate the [O III] \u03bb5007, H\u03b1 and [N II]\n\u03bb6548, 6583 emission lines. Observations were performed on\n23 September 2010 with a 2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 slit and the Thomson\n2K\u00d72K CCD which gave a spatial scale of 0.38\u2032\u2032 /pixel and a\nresolving power of R \u223c 30000 (2.82 km/s per pixel). A series\nof 1800 s exposures were taken with the slit oriented approximately along the minor (PA=60\u25e6 ) and major (PA=147\u25e6 )\naxes.\nFigure 6 presents the emission line position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams observed. Alongside these are the same PV\ndiagrams extracted from a shape (Steffen & L\u00f3pez 2006)\nbest-fitting spatio-kinematic model of ETHOS 1 built following Jones et al. (2010). Figure 7 shows the model that was\ninspired by the faint Hb 12-like bipolar extensions (Vaytet\net al. 2009) that are visible in Fig. 5c. The basic components are a spherical outflow and nested thin-walled bipolar\noutflows. The inner bipolar outflow helps reproduce the Xshape and the outer (possibly related) Hb 12-like bipolar\noutflow protrudes from the central sphere. Our approach\nwas not tailored to each emission line observed, but instead\naimed to create a good overall approximation to the features\nseen in Figs. 5 and 6. The jets were not incorporated in our\nmodel but they appear to be well-aligned to the major axis\n\nFigure 7. A shape spatio-kinematic model of ETHOS 1.\n\nunlike other PNe (e.g. Hb4). The faint bipolar extensions\n(Fig. 5c) were included in our model but their low surface\nbrightness precluded their detection on the 2.1-m telescope\nat this resolution. We note that no attempt has been made\nto replicate the relative surface brightnesses of each component in the model and deeper observations should be able\nto detect these fainter features.\nAlong the major axis the PV diagrams of the inner nebula display a figure-of-eight profile best seen in H\u03b1 that is\ntypical of a bipolar outflow with a 'pinched' waist (e.g. Icke,\nPreston & Balick 1989). This bipolar profile is also apparent in [O III], but is far more irregular and lacks emission\nfrom the central region. The southern component splits into\ntwo velocity components that are consistent with the front\nand back walls of a hollow bipolar shell. A velocity ellipse is\nalso seen in the [O III] profile surrounding the figure-of-eight\nprofile. This is consistent with a spherical shell of material\nand the minor axis PV diagrams support this interpretation.\nAlong the minor axis the outer ellipse represents the spherical shell, while the inner knot at negative velocity represents\nthe pinched bipolar shell (e.g. Vaytet et al. 2009). There is\na small amount of asymmetry in the minor axis which is\npartly due to imperfect alignment of the slit along the axis\nand partly intrinsic.\nNo emission is detected from the central region in [N II]\nconsistent with our other observations. There is however an\nelongated excess of H\u03b1 emission in the inner nebula aligned\nalong the major axis that is not matched in [O III] (e.g. Fig.\n5a). While this could be explained by ionisation stratification (e.g. the same feature may be visible in O V or O VI),\nit may also be related to similar but 'tilted' inner nebulae in\nPN G126.6+01.3 (Mampaso et al. 2006), M 2-19 (Miszalski\net al. 2009b) and A 41 (Miszalski et al. 2009b; Jones et al.\n2010). We suggest these nebulae could be the remnants of\na precessing jet (Haro-Corzo et al. 2009; Raga et al. 2009)\nor nozzle (Balick 2000). The uncanny resemblance between\nPN G126.6+01.3 and the models of Haro-Corzo et al. (2009)\nsupports this hypothesis.\nThe symmetry axis of our best-fitting shape model has\nan inclination of 60 \u00b1 5 degrees to the line of sight. This\ninclination is consistent with the non-eclipsing lightcurve,\n\n\fETHOS 1\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Mercator lightcurve of ETHOS 1 phased with P = 0.53512 days.

A heliocentric radial velocity of \u221220\u00b15 km/s was\ndetermined from our model for the nebula. The expansion\nof the model nebula follows a Hubble-type flow, where all\nvelocities are proportional to the radial distance from the\nnebular centre, equivalent to an expansion velocity of 55\nkm/s at the edge of the spherical component. This is above\naverage for a PN but not unexpected for a bipolar outflow\n(Corradi & Schwarz 1995) with He II \u03bb6560 present (Richer\net al. 2008). Figure 3 shows He II \u03bb4859 and we confirm the\ndetection of He II \u03bb6560 in our MES spectroscopy.\nAlthough the distance to ETHOS 1 is unknown, the\nspatio-kinematic model was used to determine the kinematical age per kpc of the inner nebula as 900\u00b1100 years kpc\u22121 .\nSimilarly, assuming the jets have the same inclination as the\ninternal bipolar structure, we find their kinematical age to\nbe 1750\u00b1250 years kpc\u22121 at their tips, almost double that of\nthe central region! The velocities of the jet tips reach \u221255\u00b15\nkm/s (SE jet) and 65 \u00b1 5 km/s (NW jet). Their deprojected\nvelocities at our assumed inclination are \u2212110 \u00b1 10 km/s\nand 130 \u00b1 10 km/s, respectively.\n\n4.2\n\nEmission line diagnostics\n\nTable 3 gives our measured emission line intensities for our\nextracted IDS and FORS spectra. Dereddened intensities\nwere calculated using the Howarth (1983) reddening law and\nc = 0.18. As Exter et al. (2003) point out an abundance\nanalysis for such high excitation nebulae requires photoionisation modelling to properly measure the chemical abundances. Since our spectral information is rather limited and\nlacks reliable UV and far-blue coverage we postpone this\nwork for now. Abundances of the jets are likely heavily distorted by their shocked nature, but we can investigate their\nemission line ratios for diagnostic purposes.\nThe nebular package in iraf (Shaw & Dufour 1995)\nwas used to determine electron temperatures and densities\nin the main nebula and SE jet. Assuming ne = 1000 cm\u22123 ,\nthe main nebula has a very hot Te = 17700 \u00b1 500 K. This is\ncomparable to K 1-2 with Te = 17500 \u00b1 1000 K, but is larger\nthan Te = 14800+530\n\u2212460 K measured in the Necklace (Corradi\net al. 2010). The [Ar IV] \u03bb4711/4740 density diagnostic from\nour VLT spectrum lies near the lower density limit so we find\nne = 850 \u00b1 1000 cm\u22123 . We also find the jets to be cooler\nTe = 12900 \u00b1 1000 K and to have a similarly low density by\nusing the [S II] \u03bb6731/6717 diagnostic to provide an upper\nlimit of ne . 1000 cm\u22123 .\nThe emission line ratios from separate extractions of\nthe jet tips in Tab. 3 can be compared to model predictions (Dopita 1997; Raga et al. 2008). These works aim to\nreproduce FLIERS as the result of shocks in the strongly\nphotoionised medium provided by the CSPN giving the apperance of a 'reverse-shock'. In ETHOS 1 the presence of\n[O III] in the jet and its relatively low Te =12900 K indicates strong radiative cooling is occurring in the post-shock\n\n\f8\n\nB. Miszalski et al.\n\nFigure 5.

(2008) models systematically underestimate the [O III]\n\u03bb5007/H\u03b1 ratio, although this is probably due to the relatively low stellar temperatures adopted in their models.\nThe spatial distribution of the key emission lines H\u03b1, [N II]\n\u03bb6583 and [O III] \u03bb5007 are also consistent with the Raga\net al. (2008) models. Figure 8 presents spatial profiles of\nthese lines where the CSPN continuum was subtracted from\nextractions adjacent to the lines. The results qualitatively\nagree with both IC 4634 and the models presented by Raga\net al. (2008) with [N II] extending \u223c2\u2032\u2032 further out than the\nother emission lines. This effect is also evident in Fig. 5a.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have introduced ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1+11.1), the first\nspectroscopically confirmed PN discovered from the Extremely Turquoise Halo Object Survey (ETHOS, Miszalski\net al. in prep). An irradiated close binary central star was\ndiscovered with an orbital period of 0.535 days and an amplitude of 0.816 mag. The extreme amplitude is second only\nto Sab 41 (Miszalski et al. 2009a) and is consistent with the\npresence of a very hot central star that produces the highly\nionised nebula (Te = 17700 K). The Necklace (Corradi et\nal. 2010) and K 1-2 (Exter et al. 2003) also share similarly\nlarge amplitudes and high-ionisation nebulae, although the\nabsence of low-ionisation filaments in ETHOS 1 may suggest\na slightly different evolutionary history. VLT FORS spec-\n\n\f10\n\nB. Miszalski et al.\nmay represent a bubble produced by the jets clearing out a\ncavity around the PN. Similar bipolar outflows are seen in\nA 65 (Walsh & Walton 1996), PPA 1759\u22122834 (Miszalski et\nal. 2009b) and Fg 1 (Boffin & Miszalski in prep.) suggesting\nthey may have a binary-related origin. It may also be possible that ETHOS 1 represents a slightly more evolved state\nof Hb 12 (Vaytet et al. 2009) where the spherical nebula is\nejected on top of a pre-existing Hb 12 system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFigure 8. Spatial profile of the H\u03b1, [N II] \u03bb6583 and [O III]\n\u03bb5007 emission lines from the INT IDS spectrum. The insets show\nnormalised profiles of the ends of the jets. No dereddening has\nbeen applied.\n\ntroscopy of the CSPN confirms the presence of a close binary with a large velocity separation between primary and\nsecondary components and the nebula. The presence of N\nIII, C III and C IV emission lines continues the trend seen\nin other irradiated close binary CSPN. These weak emission\nlines are typical of many CSPN classified as wels in the literature and we expect many of these will turn out to be close\nbinaries. Further observations are required to constrain the\norbital inclination, masses and radii of the binary CSPN.\nA spectacular pair of jets travelling at 120 \u00b1 10 km/s\naccompanies the inner nebula of ETHOS 1 adding further\nevidence towards the long suspected relationship between\nbinary CSPN and jets. Their tips present emission line ratios that are consistent with shocked models of FLIERS in\nPNe. The fact that the jets are detached suggests a limited\nperiod of jet activity consistent with a transient accretion\ndisk before the CE is ejected. The kinematic age of the jets\n(1750 \u00b1 250 yrs/kpc) was found to be older than the inner nebula (900 \u00b1 100 yrs/kpc) supporting this hypothesis.\nETHOS 1 therefore continues to follow this trend previously\nidentified in A 63 (Mitchell et al. 2007) and the Necklace\n(Corradi et al. 2010). Both ETHOS 1 and the Necklace have\nyounger kinematic ages than A 63 consistent with the apparent ongoing cooling in the younger jets via [O III] emission.\nA close binary engine powering jets is out of place in the\nliterature with most models of jets incorporating orbital periods of several years (Cliffe et al. 1995; Haro-Corzo et al.\n2009; Raga et al. 2009). These models may be adequate if the\naccretion disk is established before the companion begins its\nin-spiral phase as our kinematic ages suggest. Nevertheless,\nnew models with shorter orbital periods may be necessary to\nmodel the jets in objects like ETHOS 1 which are relatively\nmore collimated than extant model jets.\nVLT FORS imaging and MES high-resolution spectroscopy of the inner nebula of ETHOS 1 was conducted.\nThe X-shaped inner nebula was reconstructed using a shape\nkinematic model consisting of bipolar outflows and a spherical nebula. The faint bipolar extensions particularly visible\nin the [O III] FORS image could be an earlier ejection occurring at about the same time as the jets or alternatively\n\nWe thank the DUOPM observers supervised by Jean-Eudes\nArlot and Agn\u00e8s Acker at the OHP T120 during 20\u201321 July\n2009 for observations that gave the first indication of Iband variability in ETHOS 1.
