spherical or hyperbolic simplices, when considered as a\nfunction of the dihedral angles, can be extended continuously to degenerated simplices.\n\u00a71. Introduction\n1.1. It is well known that the area of a spherical or a hyperbolic triangle can be expressed\nas an affine function of the inner angles by the Gauss-Bonnet formula. In particular,\nthe area considered as a function of the inner angles can be extended continuously to\ndegenerated spherical or hyperbolic triangles. The purpose of the paper is to show that the\ncontinuous extension property holds in any dimension. Namely, if a sequence of spherical\n(or hyperbolic) n-simplices has the property that their corresponding dihedral angles at\ncodimension-2 faces converge, then the volumes of the simplices converge. Note that if\nwe consider the area as a function of the three edge lengths of a triangle, then there does\nnot exist any continuous extension of the area to all degenerated triangles. For instance,\na degenerated spherical triangle of edge lengths 0, \u03c0, \u03c0 is represented geometrically as\nthe intersection of two great circles at the north and the south poles. However, its area\ndepends on the intersection angle of these two geodesics and cannot be defined in terms of\nthe lengths. This 2-dimensional simple phenomenon still holds in high dimension for both\nspherical and hyperbolic simplices.\nTo state our result, let us introduce some notations. Given an n-simplex with vertices\nv1 , ..., vn+1 , the i-th codimension-1 face is defined to be the (n-1)-simplex with vertices\nv1 ,...,vi\u22121 ,vi+1 ,..., vn+1 . The dihedral angle between the i-th and j-th codimension-1 faces\nis denoted by aij . As a convention, we define aii = \u03c0 and call the symmetric matrix\n[aij ](n+1)\u00d7(n+1) the angle matrix of the simplex. It is well known that the angle matrix\n[aij ](n+1)\u00d7(n+1) determines the simplex up to isometry in spherical and hyperbolic geometry.\nLet Rm\u00d7m be the space of all real m \u00d7 m matrics. Our main result is the following.\nTheorem 1.1. Let Xn (1) and Xn (\u22121) \u2282 R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) be the spaces of angle matrices\nof all n-dimensional spherical and hyperoblic simplices respectively. The volume function\nV : Xn (k) \u2192 R can be extended continuously to the closure of Xn (k) in R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) for\nk = 1, \u22121.\nNote that both spaces Xn (1) and Xn (\u22121) are fairly explicitly known. Topologically,\nboth of them are homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n(n + 1)/2. We do\nnot know if Theorem 1.1 can be generalized to convex polytopes of the same combinatorial\ntype in the 3-sphere or the hyperbolic 3-space.\nThe proof of the theorem for spherical simplieces is quite simple. It is an easy consequence of the continuity of the function which sends a semi-positive definite symmetric\nmatrix to its square root. The case of the hyperbolic simplices is more subtle. It uses\n1\n\n\fthe continuity of the square roots of semi-positive definite symmetric matrices and the\nfollowing property of hyperbolic simplices. We use BR (x) to denote the ball of radius R\ncentered at x.\nTheorem 1.2. For any \u01eb > 0 and any r > 0, there is R = R(\u01eb, r, n) so that for any hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3, if x \u2208 \u03c3 is a point whose distance to each totally geodesic codimenison-1\nhypersurface containing a codimension-1 face is at most r, then the volume of \u03c3 \u2212 BR (x)\nis at most \u01eb.\nRecall that the center and the radius of a simplex are defined to be the center and\nthe radius of its inscribed ball. The raduis of a hyperbolic n-simplex is well known to be\nuniformaly bounded from above. Applying Theorem 1.2 to the center of the n-simplex, we\nconclude that for any \u01eb > 0, there is R = R(\u01eb) so that the volume of \u03c3 \u2212 BR (c) is less than\n\u01eb for any hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3 with center c.\nRecent work of [MY] produces an explicit formula expressing volume of spherical and\nhyperbolic tetrahedra in terms of the dihedral angles using dilogarithmic function. It is\nnot clear if Theorem 1.1 in dimension 3 follows from their explicit formula.\n1.2. Using the work of Aomoto [Ao] and Vinberg [Vi], one may express the volume of a\nsimplex in terms of an integral related to the Gaussian distribution (see (2.3) and (2.7)).\nTo state Theorem 1.1 in terms of matrices, let us introduce some notations. For an n \u00d7 n\nmatrix A, we use ad(A) to denote the adjacency matrix of A. The transpose of A is denoted\nby At . The ij-th entry of A is denoted by Aij . We use A > 0 to denote the condition that\nall entries in A are positive. Evidently, if a matrix A is positive definite, or ad(A) > 0,\nthen the following function F is well defined,\n\n(1.1)\n\nF (A) =\n\np\n\n|det(ad(A))|\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ne\u2212x\n\nad(A)x\n\ndx\n\nRn\n\u22650\n\nwhere x \u2208 Rn is a column vector, R\u22650 is the set of all non-negative numbers and dx is\nthe Euclidean volume form. Theorem 1.1 is equivalent to the following,\nTheorem 1.3. Let Xn = {A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n | At = A, all Aii = 1, A is positive definite}\nand let Yn = {A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n | At = A, all Aii = 1, ad(A) > 0, detA < 0, and all principal\n(n\u22121)\u00d7(n\u22121) submatrices of A are positive definite}. Then the function F : Xn \u222aYn \u2192 R\ncan be extended continuously to the closure of Xn \u222a Yn in Rn\u00d7n .\nWe don't know a proof of Theorem 1.3 without using hyperbolic geometry (i.e., Theorem 1.2).\n1.3. The paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we recall the basic set up and the Gram\nmatrices of simplices. Also, we prove Theorem 1.1 for spherical simplices. In \u00a73, we prove\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.1 for hyperbolic simplices assuming Theorem 1.2. We prove Theorem 1.2 in\nsection \u00a74.\n1.4. I would like to thank Z.-C, Han, Daniel Ocone, Saul Schleimer for discussions. I thank\nProfessor Nick Higham for directing my attention to the results on matrices. This work is\nsupported in part by a research councile grant from Rutgers University.\n\u00a72. Preliminaries on Spherical and Hyperbolic Simplices\nWe recall some of the basic material related to the spherical and hyperbolic simplices in\nthis section. In particular, we will recall the Gram matrices, the dual simplex and the\nvolume formula. We also give a proof of Theorem 1.1 for spherical simplices. Here are\nthe conventions and notations. Let Rm denote the m-dimensional real vector space whose\nelements are column vectors. A diagonal matrix with diagonal entries a11 , ..., ann will\nbe denoted by diag(a11, ..., ann). A diagonal matrix is positive if all diagonal entries are\npositive. The Kronecker delta is denoted by \u03b4ij . The standard inner product\nin Rm is\np\ndenoted by (x, y) = xt y. The length of a vector x \u2208 Rm is denoted by |x| = (x, x). We\nuse dx = dx1 dx2 ...dxm to denote the Euclidean volume element in Rm and Rm\n\u22650 to denote\nm\nthe set {(x1 , ..., xm) \u2208 R |xi \u2265 0 for all i}.\nWe will make a use of the continuity of the square root of symmetric semi-positive\ndefinite matrix.\nRecall that if A is a symmetric semi-positive definite matrix, then its\n\u221a\nsquare root A is the symmetric semi-positive definite matrix so that it commutes with A\nand its square is A. It is well known that the square root matrix is unique. Furthermore,\nthe square root operation, considered as a self map defined on the space of all symmetric\nsemi-positive definite matrices, is continuous (theorem 6.2.37 in [HJ]).\n2.1. Gram Matrices of Spherical Simplices\nLet Rn+1 be the Euclidean space with the standard inner product. The sphere S n is\n{x \u2208 Rn+1 |(x, x) = 1}. A spherical n-simplex \u03c3 n has vertices v1 , ..., vn+1 in S n so that the\nvectors v1 , ..., vn+1 are linearly independent. The codimension-1 face of \u03c3 n opposite vi is\ndenoted by \u03c3in . Let dij be the spherical distance between vi and vj and aij be the dihedral\nangle between the codimension-1 faces \u03c3in and \u03c3jn for i 6= j. Define dii = 0 and aii = \u03c0.\nThen the Gram matrix of \u03c3 n is defined to be the matrix G = [cos(dij )] = [(vi , vj )] and the\nangle Gram matrix of the the simplex is the matrix G\u2217 = [\u2212 cos(aij )]. Note that both of\nthem are symmetric with diagonal entries being 1. The following is a well known fact.\nLemma 2.1. The Gram matrix G and the angle Gram matrix G\u2217 of a simplex are related\nby the following formula\n(2.1)\n\nG\u2217 = DG\u22121 D\n\nwhere D is a positive diagonal matrix.\nProof. Let B = [v1 , ..., vn+1 ] be the (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrix whose i-th column is the i-th\nvertex vi . Then the Gram matrix G of the simplex \u03c3 n is B t B due to the obvious formula\n3\n\n\fvit vj = (vi , vj ) = cos(dij ). To relate the matrix G\u2217 with G, we consider the dual simplex.\nFirst, find (n+1) independent vectors w1 , ..., wn+1 \u2208 Rn+1 so that\n(2.2)\n\n(vi , wj ) = \u03b4ij .\n\nDefine vi\u2217 = wi /|wi |. Then the dual simplex of \u03c3 n is the spherical simplex with vertices\n\u2217\n{v1\u2217 , ..., vn+1\n}. If we use W = [w1 , ..., wn+1 ], then (2.2) says B t W = Id. In particular,\nW = (B t )\u22121 . Thus W t W = (B t B)\u22121 = G\u22121 . However, by the formula vi\u2217 = wi /|wi |, we\nsee that the Gram matrix of the dual simplex is D(W t W )D = DG\u22121 D where D is the\ndiagonal matrix whose ii-th entry is |wi |\u22121 . On the other hand, by the definition of dual\nsimplex, the Gram matrix of the dual is exactly the same as the angle Gram matrix of \u03c3 n .\nNamely, the spherical distance between vi\u2217 and vj\u2217 is \u03c0 \u2212 aij . Thus (2.1) follows. QED\nThe volume of the simplex \u03c3 n can be calculated as follows (see [Ao], [Vi] ). For\nthe simplex \u03c3 n \u2282 S n , let the cone in Rn+1 based at the origin over \u03c3 n be K(\u03c3 n ) =\n{rx \u2208 Rn+1 |r \u2265 0 and x \u2208 \u03c3 n }. Note that the linear transformation B : Rn+1 \u2192\nRn+1 sending the vector x toR Bx takes the standard basis\n\u221a element ei to vi . In particular\n2\n\u221e\nB(Rn\u22650 ) = K(\u03c3 n ). Let \u03bck = 0 xk e\u2212x dx, i.e., \u03bc2k = \u03c0(1.3....(2k \u2212 3)(2k \u2212 1)/2k+1 and\n\u03bc2k+1 = 2.4....(2k \u2212 2)(2k)/2k+1 . Let the volume element on S n be ds, then the volume\nV (\u03c3 n ) of the simplex \u03c3 n is given by (see [Ao], [Vi]),\nZ\nn\nds\nV (\u03c3 ) =\n\u03c3n\n\n= \u03bc\u22121\nn\n= \u03bc\u22121\nn\n=\n\n(2.3)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212(x,x) dx\n\nK(\u03c3 n )\n\ne\u2212(x,x) dx\nB(Rn+1\n)\n\u22650\n\n\u03bc\u22121\nn\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u22121\nn\n\nZ\np\n|detG|\n\nRn+1\n\u22650\n\ne\u2212(By,By) |detB|dy\ne\u2212y\n\nt\n\nGy\n\ndy.\n\nRn+1\n\u22650\n\nn+1\nLemma 2.2. Let \u03c7 be the characteristic function of the set Rn+1\n, then the\n\u22650 in R\nn\nn\nvolume V (\u03c3 ) of a spherical simplex \u03c3 can be written as\nZ\n\u221a\nn\n\u22121\ne\u2212(x,x) \u03c7( G\u2217 (x))dx.\n(2.4)\nV (\u03c3 ) = \u03bcn\nRn+1\n\nt\n\u22121\nProof. Note that since G\n\u221a = B B is positive definite, G is again symmetric and positive definite. Let A = G\u22121 be the square root of G\u22121 so that A is symmetric positive definite and AGA = Id. Now make a change of variable y = Az in (2.3) where\n\n4\n\n\fn\n\u22121\nz \u2208 A\u22121 (Rn+1\n\u22650 ). Then, V (\u03c3 ) = \u03bcn\n\nR\n\nA\u22121 (Rn+1\n)\n\u22650\n\ne\u2212(z,z) dz. Note that the characteristic\n\nfunction of A\u22121 (Rn+1\n\u22650 ) is the same as the composition \u03c7 \u25e6 A. Thus the volume is\nn\n\nV (\u03c3 ) =\n\n\u03bc\u22121\nn\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212(x,x) \u03c7(A(x))dx.\n\nRn+1\n\nFinally, note that if we make a change of variable of the form x = D(y) where D is\na positive\n\u221a diagonal matrix, the integral (2.3) does not change. By lemma 1.1, we have\nA = D G\u2217 D for a positive diagonal matrix D. Thus (2.4) holds.\n2.2. A Proof of Theorem 1.1 for Spherical Simplices\nWe give a proof of Theorem 1.1 for spherical simplices in this section. Let Xn (1) be\nthe space of all angle matrices [aij ](n+1)\u00d7(n+1) of spherical n-simplices where aij = aji\nand aii = \u03c0. The map sending [aij ] to the angle Gram matrix G\u2217 = [\u2212 cos(aij )] is an\nembedding of the closure of Xn (1) into the space of all semi-positive definite, symmetric\nmatrices whose diagonal entries are 1. Thus, to prove the continuity of the volume function\non Xn (1), by (2.4) it suffices to show the continuity of the function W : Xn \u2192 R sending\na matrix A to\nZ\n\u221a\ne\u2212(x,x) \u03c7 \u25e6 A(x)dx.\n(2.5)\nW (A) =\nRn+1\n\nTo this end, take a sequence {Am } in Xn so that limm\u2192\u221e Am = A in R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) . To\nestablish the existence of limm\u2192\u221e W (Am ), we first use the fact that the function sending\na semi-positive\nto its square root is continuous (theorem 6.2.37 in [HJ]). In\n\u221a definite matrix \u221a\nparticular, Am converges to A.\nLemma 2.3. Suppose Bm is a convergent sequence of (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrices so that\nlimm\u2192\u221e Bm = B. If each row vector of B is none-zero, then the function \u03c7\u25e6Bm converges\nalmost everywhere to \u03c7 \u25e6 B in Rn+1 .\nAssuming this lemma, we finish the\nentries of A are\n\u221a proof as follows. Since all diagonal\u221a\n1, we conclude that no row\u221avector in A is zero. Thus by the lemma, \u03c7 \u25e6 Am converges\nalmost everywhere to \u03c7 \u25e6 A in Rn+1 . Since the integrant in W (A)) is bounded by the\nintegrable function e\u2212(y,y) , the dominant convergent theorem implies that limm\u2192\u221e W (Am )\nexists.\nTo prove lemma 2.3, let Ri = {x \u2208 Rn+1 |xi = 0} be the coordinate planes. Then\nB \u22121 (Ri ) is a proper subspace of Rn+1 . Indeed, if otherwise, say for some index i,\nB(Rn+1 ) \u2282 Ri , then the i-th row of B must be zero. This contradicts the assumption.\nTherefore, the Lebegue measure of B \u22121 (Ri ) is zero for all indices i. Now we claim for every\n\u22121\n(Ri ), the sequence \u03c7 \u25e6 Bm (x) converges to \u03c7 \u25e6 B(x). Indeed,\npoint x \u2208 Rn+1 \u2212 \u222an+1\ni=1 B\nby the assumption, Bm (x) converges to B(x) \u2208 Rn+1 \u2212 \u222an+1\ni=1 Ri . Thus we have \u03c7(Bm (x))\nconverges to \u03c7(B(x)). QED\n5\n\n\fThe above also produced a proof of Theorem 1.3 for the case of continuous extension\nof F to the closure of Xn .\n2.3. Volume and Gram Matrices of Hyperbolic Simplices\nn,1\nThe (n+1)-dimensional Minkowski space\nis Rn+1 together with the symmetPnR\nt\nric non-singular bilinear form < x, y >=\ni=1 xi yi \u2212 xn+1 yn+1 = x Sy where S =\ndiag(1, 1, ..., 1, \u22121) is an (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) diagonal matrix. We define the hyperboloid\nof two sheets to be S(\u22121) = {x \u2208 Rn,1 | < x, x >= \u22121} and the unit sphere S(1) =\n{x \u2208 Rn,1 | < x, x >= 1}. The space S(\u22121) has two connected components. It is well\nknown that each of them can be taken as a model for the n-dimensional hyperbolic space\nH n . For simplicity, we take H n to be the component with positive last coordinates, i.e.,\nH n = S(\u22121) \u2229 {xn+1 > 0}. Given a vector u \u2208 S(1), let u\u22a5 be the totally geodesic\ncodimension-1 space {x \u2208 H n | < x, u >= 0}. The following lemma is well known (see for\ninstance [Vi]).\n\nLemma 2.4. Suppose u, v \u2208 S(1) \u222a S(\u22121). The following holds.\n(1) If u, v \u2208 H n , then < u, v >\u2264 \u22121 and the hyperbolic distance between u, v is\n\u22121\ncosh (\u2212 < u, v >).\n(2) If u, v \u2208 S(1), then u\u22a5 intersects v \u22a5 if and only if | < u, v > | < 1. In this case,\nthe dihedral angle of the intersection u\u22a5 , v \u22a5 in the region {x \u2208 H n | < x, u >< x, v >\u2265 0}\nis arccos(\u2212 < u, v >).\np\n(3) If u \u2208 H n and v \u2208 S(1), then the distance from u to v \u22a5 is cosh\u22121 ( 1+ < u, v >2 ).\nA hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3 n has vertices v1 , ..., vn+1 in H n so that these vectors are\nlinearly independent in Rn,1 . We denote the codimension-1 face of \u03c3 n opposite to vi\nby \u03c3in . The hyperbolic distance between vi and vj is denoted by dij and the dihedral\nangle between \u03c3in and \u03c3jn is denoted by aij for i 6= j. As a convention, dii = 0 and\naii = \u03c0. As in the case of spherical simplices, we define the Gram matrix G of \u03c3 n to be\nG = [cosh dij ] = [\u2212 < vi , vj >] and the angle Gram matrix of \u03c3 n to be G\u2217 = [\u2212 cos(aij )].\nNote that both of these matrices are symmetric with diagonal entries \u00b11.\nThe counterpart of lemma 2.1 holds, it is the following,\nLemma 2.5. Suppose G and G\u2217 are the Gram matrix and the angle Gram matrix of a\nhyperbolic n-simplex, then there is a positive diagonal matrix D so that\nG\u2217 = \u2212DG\u22121 D.\nProof. By lemma 2.4, cosh dij = \u2212 < vi , vj >= \u2212vit Svj . Let B = [v1 , ..., vn+1 ] be\nthe square matrix whose i-th column is the i-th vertex vi , then by definition the Gram\nmatrix G is \u2212B t SB where S = diag(1, 1, .., 1, \u22121). To relate G\u2217 with G, we find vectors\nw1 , ..., wn+1 in Rn,1 so that < vi , wj >= \u03b4ij . Indeed, these vectors can be found by taking\nthe matrix W = [w1 , ..., wn+1 ]. The condition < vi , wj >= \u03b4ij translates to the equation,\nB t SW = Id, i.e., W = S(B t )\u22121 . By the construction of vertices {v1 , ..., vn+1 }, the bilinear\n6\n\n\fform <, > restricted to the codimension-1 linear space spanned by {v1 , ..., vn+1 } \u2212 {vi } has\n\u221a\nsignature (n \u2212 1, 1). This implies that < wi , wi > is positive. Define vi\u2217 = wi / < wi , wi >.\n\u221a\nThen vi\u2217 \u2208 S(1) and < vi\u2217 , vj >= ( < wi , wi >)\u22121 \u03b4ij . The last equation shows that\nvi\u2217 is the unit vector in S(1) orthogonal to the i-th codimension-1 face \u03c3in so that <\nvi , vi\u2217 >> 0. By lemma 2.4(2), the intersection angle aij between \u03c3in and \u03c3jn is given by\nthe equation \u2212 cos aij =< vi\u2217 , vj\u2217 >. This shows that the Gram matrix A = [< vi\u2217 , vj\u2217 >]\n\u2217\nof the vectors {v1\u2217 , ..., vn+1\n} is equal to the angle Gram matrix G\u2217 . On the other hand,\n\u221a\n\u2217\nvi = wi / < wi , wi >. Thus the Gram matrix A can be expressed as DF D where D is a\ndiagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries and F is the Gram matrix [< wi , wj >]. By\ndefinition, F = W t SW . Since W = S(B t )\u22121 , we have F = W t SW = (B t SB)\u22121 = \u2212G\u22121 .\nThis establishes G\u2217 = \u2212DG\u22121 D.

Some Results from Matrix Pertubation Theory\nThe following two results will be used frequently in the paper. See [SS], [Wi] for\nproofs. The first theorem states the continuous dependence of eigenvalues on the matrices.\nTheorem 2.7(Ostrowski) Let \u03bb be an eigenvalue of A of algebraic multiplicity m. Then for\nany matrix norm ||.|| and all sufficiently small \u01eb > 0, there is \u03b4 > 0 so that if ||B \u2212 A|| \u2264 \u03b4,\nthe disk {z \u2208 C||z \u2212 \u03bb| \u2264 \u01eb} contains exactly m eigenvalues of B counted with multiplicity.\nThe next theorem concerns the continuous dependence of eigenvectors on the matrices.\nWe state the result in the form applicable to our situation. Recall that an eigenvalue of a\nmatrix is called simple if it is the simple root of the characteristic polynomial.\nTheorem 2.8 (see [Wi], p67) Suppose Am is a sequence of n \u00d7 n matrices converging to\nB. Suppose \u03bb is a simple eigenvalue of B and \u03bbm is a simple eigenvalue of Am so that\nlimm\u2192\u221e \u03bbm = \u03bb. Then there exists a sequence of eigenvectors vm of Am associated to \u03bbm\nso that these eigenvectors converge to an eigenvector of B associated to \u03bb.\nThis theorem follows from the fact that if \u03bb is simple eigenvalue, then the adjacency\nmatrix ad(B \u2212 \u03bbId) has rank 1 and its non-zero column vectors are the eigenvectors of B\nassociated to \u03bb.\n\u00a73. A Proof of Theorem 1.1 for Hyperbolic Simplices Assuming Theorem 1.2\nRecall that Xn (\u22121) denotes the space of all angle matrices [aij ] of hyperbolic n-simplices.\nThe map cos(x) is an embedding of [0, \u03c0] to [\u22121, 1]. Thus the angle Gram matrix G\u2217 =\n[\u2212 cos(aij )] is a map which embeds the closure of Xn (\u22121) in R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) to the space of\nall symmetric matrics. The characterization of angle Gram matrix [\u2212 cos(aij )] was known.\nLemma 3.1. ([Lu], [Mi]) An (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) symmetric matrix A with diagonal entries\nbeing one is the angle Gram matrix of a hyperbolic n-simplex if and only if\n(3.1) all principal n \u00d7 n submatrices of A are positive definite,\n(3.2) det(A) < 0, and,\n(3.3) all entries of the adjacency matrix ad(A) are positive.\nLet Yn+1 be the space of all real matrices satisfying conditions in lemma 3.1 and\ndefine a function F : Yn+1 \u2192 R as in (1.1). Note that by change the variable x to D(x)\nfor a positive diagonal matrix D, we see that F (A) = F (DAD). Thus to establish theorem\n1.1 for hyperbolic n-simplices, it suffices to prove that F : Yn+1 \u2192 R can be extended\n8\n\n\f \u0304 in R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) . This will be the goal in the rest of the\ncontinuously to the closure Yn+1\nsection.\n3.1. To prove Theorem 1.3 for Yn+1 , take a convergent sequence of matrices Am \u2208 Yn+1 so\nthat limm\u2192\u221e Am = A\u221e where A\u221e \u2208 R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) . We will prove that limm\u2192\u221e F (Am )\nexists. Since the function F (A) = F (DAD) for any positive diagonal matrix D, we\nwill modify the sequence {Am } by Dm Am Am for positive diagonal matrices Dm so that\nlimm\u2192\u221e F (Dm Am Dm ) converges. This will be the strategy of the proof.\nBy definition, all diagonal entries of A\u221e are 1. If det(A\u221e ) 6= 0, then the signature\nof A\u221e is (n, 1). If det(A\u221e ) = 0, we claim that A\u221e is semi-positive definite. Indeed, by\ndefinition, all principal proper submatrices of A\u221e are semi-positive definite. This, together\nwith det(A\u221e ) = 0, implies that A\u221e is semi-positive definite. The proof of Theorem 1.3\nuses the following lemma to perturb A\u221e and Am to DA\u221e D and Dm Am Dm for some\npositive diagonal matrices D and Dm so that Dm Am Dm converges to DA\u221e D and all\nnon-zero eigenvalues of Dm Am Dm and DA\u221e D are simple, i.e., they are the simple roots\nof the characteristic polynomials.\nLemma 3.2. Given a symmetric n \u00d7 n matrix A of signature (k, 0) or (k, 1), and \u01eb > 0,\nthere exists a positive diagonal matrix D so that |D \u2212 Id| \u2264 \u01eb and all non-zero eigenvalues\nof DAD are simple.\nThis is a very simple consequence of the work on multiplicative inverse eigenvalue\nproblem (see for instance [Fr]). For completeness, we provide a simple proof of it in the\nappendix.\nApplying this lemma, we find a positive diagonal matrix D so that DA\u221e D has\nonly simple non-zero eigenvalues and also a positive diagonal matrix Dm within distance 1/m of the identity matrix so that Dm DAm DDm has distinct eigenvalues and\nlimm\u2192\u221e Dm DAm DDm = DA\u221e D. Since F (DAm D) = F (Am ) for any positive diagonal matrix D, the modification of the sequence Am to Dm DAm DDm does not change the\nexistence of the limit limm\u2192\u221e F (Am ). By theorems 2.7 and 2.8, we may assume, after\nmodifying Am to Dm DADDm , the following,\n(3.4) all eigenvalues {\u03bbi (m)|i = 1, 2, ..., n + 1} of Am are pairwise distinct, i.e.,\n\u03bb1 (m) > \u03bb2 (m) > .... > \u03bbn (m) > 0 > \u03bbn+1 (m),\nand all non-zero eigenvaules of A\u221e are pairwise distinct.\n(3.5) the limit limm\u2192\u221e \u03bbi (m) = \u03bbi (\u221e) exists for all i = 1, ..., n + 1 where \u03bbi (\u221e)'s are the\neigenvalues of A\u221e . Furthermore, either rank(A\u221e ) = n + 1 and\n\u03bb1 (\u221e) > \u03bb2 (\u221e) > .... > \u03bbn (\u221e) > 0 > \u03bbn+1 (\u221e),\nor k = rank(A\u221e ) \u2264 n and\n\u03bb1 (\u221e) > \u03bb2 (\u221e) > .... > \u03bbk (\u221e) > \u03bbk+1 (\u221e) = .... = \u03bbn+1 (\u221e) = 0.\n9\n\n\f3.2. We need the folloing canonical decomposition of matrices A \u2208 Yn+1 . Note that A2\nis symmetric\nand positive definite. In particular, the symmetric positive definite matrix\np\u221a\n2\nB=\nA exists. Furthermore, the function B = B(A) : Yn+1 \u2192 R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) can be\n \u0304 . Suppose the eigenvalues of A are \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265\nextended continuously to the closure Yn+1\n.... \u2265 \u03bbn > 0 > \u2212\u03bbn+1 . Then there exists an orthonormal matrix U = [v1 , ..., vn+1 ] whose\ncolumn vectors vi are eigenvectors of length one so that\nA = U diag(\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn, \u2212\u03bbn+1 )U t .\n\n(3.6)\n\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nWe can recover B from (3.6) by the formula B = U diag( \u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn , \u03bbn+1 )U t . In\nparticular, we have\nA = BU SU t B\n\n(3.7)\nand\n\nU t BA\u22121 BU = S.\n\n(3.8)\nFurthermore, due to Bvi =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bbi vi ,\n\np\np\np\nBU = [ \u03bb1 v1 , ..., \u03bbn vn , \u03bbn+1 vn+1 ].\nNote that in general the matrix U is not uniquely determined by A due to the multiple\neigenvalues. However, if the eigenvalues of A are pairwise distinct, then each eigenvector\nvi of norm 1 is determined by the associated eigenvalue \u03bbi up to sign.\nThe geometric meaning of the decomposition (3.7) is the following,\nn\nwith\nProposition 3.3. Consider the hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3 = U t B \u22121 (Rn+1\n\u22650 ) \u2229 H\nt\ncodimension-i faces \u03c3i for i = 1, 2, ..., n + 1. The point en+1 = [0, ..., 0, 1] is in the simplex\n\u03c3 and the\np distance from en+1 to the totally geodesic codimension-1 space sp(\u03c3i ) is at most\ncosh\u22121 ( 1 + \u03bbn+1 ) for all i.\nn\nt \u22121\n(ei )/ <\nProof. The vertices of the n-simplex \u03c3 = U t B \u22121 (Rn+1\n\u22650 ) \u2229 H are vi = U B\nt \u22121\nt \u22121\n1/2\nt\nU B (ei ), U B (ei ) >\nwhere ei = [0, .., 0, 1, 0, .., 0] is the standard basis of Rn+1 .\nTo find the distance from en+1 to the codimension-1 totally geodesic space sp(\u03c3i ), we\nfind the normal vector to sp(\u03c3i ) as follows. Consider the column vectors w1 , ..., wn+1 of\nW = SU t B. These vectors wi satisfy the conditions,\n\n(3.9) < wi , wi >= 1 for all i,\n(3.10) < wi , U t B \u22121 (ej ) >= 0 for i 6= j,\n\n(3.11) < wi , U t B \u22121 (ei ) >= 1 for all i.\n\n10\n\n\fIndeed, (3.9) follows from (3.7) that W t SW = A and Aii = 1 for all i. Also (3.10)\nand (3.11) follow from the identity W t SU t B \u22121 = BU SSU t B \u22121 = Id. This shows that wi\nis the normal vector in the de-Sitter space S(1) which is perpendicular to sp(\u03c3i ) so that\n< wi , U t B \u22121 ei >> 0. To find the distance from en+1 to the codimension-1 totally geodesic\nhypersurface containing a codimension-1 face, we shouldp\ncalculate < wi , en+1 >. Indeed,\nsince W t Sen+1 = BU SSen+1 = BU en+1 = Bvn+1 = \u03bbn+1 vn+1 and the eigenvector\np\nvn+1 has norm 1, we obtain | < wi , en+1 > | \u2264 \u03bbn+1 . By lemma 2.4(3), we conclude\np\nthat the distance from en+1 to these codimension-1 faces are at most cosh\u22121 ( 1 + \u03bbn+1 ).\nFinally, we need to show that en+1 is in the simplex \u03c3. This is the same as showing\nthat all entries of the eigenvector vn+1 have the same sign. To this end, we need,\nLemma 3.4. Suppose B is a symmetric (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrix so that all n \u00d7 n principal\nsubmatrices in B are positive definite and det(B) \u2264 0. Then no entry in the adjacent\nmatrix ad(B) is zero.\nAssuming this lemma, we prove that all entries of the eigenvector vn+1 have the\nsame sign as follows. For the variable t \u2208 [0, \u03bbn+1 ], consider the matrix C(t) = A + tId.\nBy definition, all n \u00d7 n principal submatix of C(t) are positive definite. Furthermore,\ndet(C(t)) \u2264 0 since the smallest eigenvalue of C(t) is t \u2212 \u03bbn+1 \u2264 0. By the lemma, all\nentries ad(C(t))ij are non-zero. On the other hand, ad(C(t))ij is a polynomial in t and is\npositive when t = 0 by (3.3). Thus all ad(C(t))ij > 0. Now for t = \u03bbn+1 , the first colume\nof ad(C(\u03bbn+1 )) is an eigenvector of A associated to \u2212\u03bbn+1 . Since this negative eigenvalue\nis simple, any two associated eigenvectors are multiple of each other. This ends the proof.\nNow to prove lemma 3.4, we first note that Bad(B) = det(B)Id. Also, the positive\ndefiniteness of the principal submatrice shows that ad(B)ii > 0 for all i. If there is an entry\nad(B)ij = 0, then i 6= j. Without loss of generality, let us assume that ad(B)1(n+1) = 0.\nLet w be the first colume of ad(B). The vector w is not the zero vector due to ad(B)11 > 0.\nBy the assumption that the principal submatrix P obtained by removing the last row and\ncolumn is positive definite, we have wt Bw = wt P w > 0. On the other hand, Bw =\ndet(B)[1, 0, ..., 0]t by definition and wt Bw = det(B)ad(B)11 \u2264 0 due to det(B) \u2264 0 and\nad(B)11 > 0. This is a contradiction. QED\n3.3. We now prove Theorem 1.3.

Let k be the rank of A\u221e . By theorem 2.8 and (3.4) and (3.5), we may choose\neigenvectors v1 (m), ..., vk (m) of unit length for Am associated to the simple eigenvalues\n\u03bbi (m) for so that\nlim vi (m) = vi (\u221e)\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nexists for i = 1, 2, ..., k and vi (\u221e) is an eigenvector of norm 1 for A\u221e . In particular, we\nsee that the matrix\np\np\np\np\nBm Um = [ \u03bb1 (m)v1 (m), ..., \u03bbk (m)vk (m), \u03bbk+1 (m)vk+1 (m), ..., |\u03bbn+1 (m)|vn+1 (m)]\n11\n\n\fp\np\np\nis converging\nto\n[\n\u03bb\n(\u221e)v\n(\u221e),\n...,\n\u03bb\n(\u221e)v\n(\u221e),\n0,\n...,\n0]\nif\nk\n\u2264\nn\nor\nto\n[\n\u03bb1 (\u221e)v1 (\u221e),\n1\n1\nk\nk\np\np\n..., \u03bbn (\u221e)vn (\u221e), |\u03bbn+1 (\u221e)|vn+1 (\u221e)] for k = n + 1 by (3.4) and (3.5).\nUsing (3.12), let us make a change of variable x = Bm Um (y) in\nF (Am ) =\n\np\n\n|det(Am\n\n)\u22121 |\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nex\n\nA\u22121\nm x\n\ndx.\n\nRn+1\n\u22650\n\nWe obtain by (3.8),\nF (Am ) =\n\n(3.13)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nRn+1\n\nZ\n\ney\n\nt\n\nSy\n\ndy\n\n(Bm Um )\u22121 (Rn+1\n)\n\u22650\n\ne<y,y> \u03c7 \u25e6 (Bm Um )(y)dy\n\nn+1\n.\nwhere \u03c7 is the characteristic function of Rn+1\n\u22650 in R\nBy the contruction, Bm Um converges to a matrix in R(n+1)\u00d7(n+1) . We claim that the\nsequence of functions \u03c7\u25e6(Bm Um ) converges almost everywhere in Rn+1 . In fact, by lemma\n2.3, it suffices to verify that no row vector in limm\u2192\u221e Bm Um is zero. Suppose otherwise,\nt\nsay the i-th row is zero. Then the ii-th entry in limm\u2192\u221e Bm Um SUm\nBm is zero. But by\nt\nassumption, the ii-th entry in Bm Um SUm Bm is (Am )ii which is always 1.\nTo summary, we see that the integrant in (3.13) converges almost everywhere in Rn+1 .\nTo prove that the limit limm\u2192\u221e F (Am ) exists, we will use the following well known lemma\nfrom analysis. We omit the proof.\n\nLemma 3.5. Suppose {fm } is a sequence of integrable non-negative functions converging\nalmost everywhere to f in Rn . If for any \u01eb > 0, there exists a measureable set E \u2282 Rn so\nthat\n(a) the restriction fm |E converges a.e. to f |E and is dominated by an integrable\nfunction Rg on E, and\n(b) E fm dx \u2264\nR \u01eb for all integer m \u2265 1,\nthen the limm\u2192\u221e Rn fm dx exists.\nTo apply this lemma, we will produce a decomposition of integral (3.13) as follows.\nFor any p > 0 and p < 1, consider the set \u03a9p = {x \u2208 Rn+1 | < x, x >\u2264 \u2212p(x, x)} where\n(x, x) = xt x is the Euclidean inner product.\nThe intersection \u03a9p \u2229 H n is equal to the\np\nhyperbolic ball of radius r = cosh\u22121 ( (1 + p)/2p) centered at en+1 . Indeed, we may\nwrite (x, x) =< x, xp> +2(x, en+1 )2 . Thus < x, x >\u2264 \u2212p(x, x) inside H n is the same as\nthe claim that \u03a9p \u2229 H n = Br (en+1 )\n| < x, en+1 > | \u2264 (1 + p)/2p. By lemma 2.4(1),\nR\nfollows. Now in the region \u03a9p , the integral \u03a9p e<y,y> \u03c7 \u25e6 (Bm Um )(y)dy converges since\n\nthe intergrant\nis dominated by the integrable function e\u2212p(y,y) . On the other hand, the\nR\nintegral Rn+1 \u2212\u03a9p e<y,y> \u03c7\u25e6(Bm Um )(y)dy is the same as \u03bcn vol(\u03c3m \u2212Br (en+1 )) where \u03c3m =\nn\n(Bm Um )\u22121 (Rn+1\n\u22650 ) \u2229 H is a hyperbolic n-simplex. By proposition 3.3 and the existence of\n\n12\n\n\flimm\u2192\u221e \u03bbn+1 (m), there is a constant C independent of m so that en+1 is within distance\nC to each codimension-1 totally geodesic surface containing a codimension-1 face of the\nsimplex \u03c3m . By Theorem 1.2 and proposition 3.3, the volume vol(\u03c3m \u2212 Br (en+1 )) can be\nmade arbitrary small for all n-simplices \u03c3m if the radius r is large. Thus, by lemma 3.5,\nwe conclude that the limit limm\u2192\u221e F (Am ) exists. QED\n\u00a74. A Proof of Theorem 1.2\nWe prove Theorem 1.2 in this section. Recall that BR (x) denotes the ball of radius R\ncentered at x.\nTheorem 1.2. For any \u01eb > 0 and r > 0, there exists a positive number R = R(\u01eb, r, n) so\nthat for any hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3, if x \u2208 \u03c3 is a point whose distance to each totally\ngeodesic hyperplane containing a codimension-1 face is at most r, then the volume of\n\u03c3 \u2212 BR (x) is at most \u01eb.\nThe theorem will follow from a sequence of propositions and lemmas on hyperbolic\nsimplices. To begin with, we fix the notations and conventions\nfollow. The projective\nPas\nn\nn\nn\nn\ndisk model of H is denoted by D = {(x1 , ..., xn) \u2208 R | i=1 x2i < 1}. The compact closure of Dn is denoted by D \u0304n which is the compactification of the hyperbolic\nspace by adding the ideal points. The hyperbolic distance in H n or Dn will be denoted\nby d. If {v1 , ..., vk } is a set of points in D \u0304n , the convex hull of it will be denoted by\nC(v1 , ..., vk ). The volume of C(v1 , ..., vn+1 ) in Dn , denoted by vol(C(v1 , ..., vk )), is the\nhyperbolic volume of C(v1 , ..., vn+1 ) \u2229 Dn . If v1 , ..., vn+1 are pairwise distinct, we call\n\u03c3 = C(v1 , ..., vn+1 ) a generalized n-simplex in D \u0304n . Its i-th codimension-1 face, denoted by\n\u03c3 i is C(v1 , ..., vi\u22121 , vi+1 , ..., vn+1 ). A generalized n-simplex is said to be non-degenerated\nif it has positive volume. Evidently, a generalized n-simplex C(v1 , ..., vn+1 ) in D \u0304n is nondegenerated if and only if the vectors {v1 , ..., vn+1 } are linearly independent in Rn+1 . The\ncenter and the radius of a non-degenerated generalized n-simplex are defined to be the\ncenter and the radius of its inscribed ball. Given a finite set X \u2208 D \u0304n so that X contains\nat least two points, the smallest complete totally geodesic submanifold containing X in its\nclosure is deonted by sp(X). For a measurable subset X of H n , or Dn , we use vol(X) to\ndenote the volume of the set. If X lies in a totally geodesic submanifold of dimension-k\nH k in H n , we use volk (X) to denote the volume of X in the subspace H k .\n4.1. We will establish the following propositions and lemmas in order to prove Theorem\n1.2.\nThe first proposition generalizes a result of Ratcliffe.\nProposition 4.1. (see [Ra], theorem 11.3.2) Suppose \u03c3m = C(v1 (m), ..., vn+1(m)) is a\nsequence of generalized n-simplices in Dn so that limm\u2192\u221e vi (m) = ui exists in D \u0304n for\nall i = 1, ..., n + 1 and either {u1 , ..., un+1} contains at least three points or {u1 , ..., un+1 }\nconsists of two distinct points {p, q} so that both sets {i|ui = p} and {i|uj = q} contain\nmore than one point. Then limm\u2192\u221e vol(\u03c3m ) = vol(C(u1 , ..., un+1 )).\n13\n\n\fNote that Ratcliffe proved the proposition when C(u1 , ..., un+1 ) is a non-degenerated\ngeneralized n-simplex. (In [Ra], a non-degenerated generalized simplex in our sense is called\na generalized n-simplex.) However, if one exams his proof carefully in ([Ra], p527-529), the\nnon-degeneracy condition is never used. Ratcliffe in fact already proved the proposition\nunder the assumption that {u1 , ..., un+1 } are pairwise distinct. Thus, it suffices to prove\nthe proposition in the case that the number of elements in {u1 , ..., un+1} is at most n and\nis at least 2 as specified in the proposition. This will be proved in subsection 4.3.\nProposition 4.2. For any \u01eb > 0, there is a number \u03b4 > 0 so that if the radius of the\ninscribed ball of a hyperbolic n-simplex is less than \u03b4, the volume of the simplex is less than\n\u01eb.\nLemma 4.3. For any \u03b4 > 0 and r > 0, there exists R = R(\u03b4, r, n) so that for any\nhyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3 of radius at least \u03b4, if x \u2208 \u03c3 is a point whose distance to each\ncodimension-1 totally geodesic surface containing a codimension-1 face is at most r, then\nd(x, c) \u2264 R where c is the center of \u03c3.\nFinally, we recall the following useful lemma of Thurston,\nLemma 4.4. Given a generalized hyperbolic n-simplex \u03c3 = C(v1 , ..., vn+1 ) where n \u2265 2,\nlet \u03c4 = C(v1 , ..., vn) be a codimension-1 face of \u03c3, then\nvoln (\u03c3) \u2264 1/(n \u2212 1)voln\u22121 (\u03c4 ).\nSee [Thu], chapter 6, or [Ra], p518-528, especially p528 for a proof.\n4.2. A Proof of Theorem 1.2\nAssuming the results above, we finish the proof of Theorem 1.2 as follows. Suppose\notherwise that Theorem 1.2 is not true. Then there are \u01eb0 > 0, r0 > 0, a sequence of\nhyperbolic n-simplices \u03c3m , and a point xm \u2208 \u03c3m so that,\n(4.1) The distance of xm to the totally geodesic codimension-1 surface containing each\ncodimension-1 face of \u03c3m is at most r0 , and,\n(4.2) V ol(\u03c3m \u2212 Bm (xm )) \u2265 \u01eb0 .\nBy proposition 4.2 and condition (4.2), we may assume that the radius rm of \u03c3m\nis at least \u03b40 > 0 for all m. By lemma 4.3 for \u03b40 and r0 , we find a constant R0 so\nthat d(xm , cm ) \u2264 R0 for all m where cm is the center of the simplex \u03c3m . In particular,\nBm\u2212R0 (cm ) \u2282 Bm (xm ). This implies \u03c3m \u2212 Bm (xm ) \u2282 \u03c3m \u2212 Bm\u2212R0 (cm ) and\n(4.3)\n\nvol(\u03c3m \u2212 Bm\u2212R0 (cm )) \u2265 \u01eb0 ,\n\nfor all m.\nIn the projective disk model Dn , we put the center cm to the Euclidean center 0 of Dn .\nBy taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that \u03c3m = C(v1 (m), ..., vn+1 (m))\nwhere the limit limm\u2192\u221e vi (m) = ui exists in D \u0304n .\n14\n\n\fLemma 4.5. Suppose \u03c3m = C(v1 (m), ..., vn+1 (m)) is a sequence of hyperbolic n-simplices\nwith center 0 in the projective model Dn so that the limit limm\u2192\u221e vi (m) = ui exists in\nD \u0304n for all i. If lim inf m\u2192\u221e vol(\u03c3m ) > 0, then either {u1 , ..., un+1} consists of at least\nthree points, or {u1 , ..., un+1} = {p, q}, p 6= q, so that both sets {i|ui = p} and {j|uj = q}\ncontain at least two points.\nTo prove this lemma, suppose otherwise, there are two possibilities. In the first possibility, {u1 , ..., un+1 } consists of one point {p}. Then for all m large, the points vi (m) are\nclose to p in the Euclidean metric in D \u0304n . If p is in Dn , then the volume of \u03c3m tends to zero\nwhich contradicts the assumption. If p is in S n\u22121 , then \u03c3m cannot have the center to be 0\nfor m large. In the second possibility, we may assume that u2 = ... = un+1 6= u1 . In this\n1\ncase, consider the codimension-1 face \u03c3m\n= C(v2 (m), ..., vn+1 (m)). This (n-1)-simplex is\nclose to u2 for m large in the Euclidean metric. Since the face is tangent to 0, it follows\n1\nthat u2 = ... = un+1 = 0. This implies that the (n-1)-dimensional volume voln\u22121 (\u03c3m\n)\ntends to zero. By Thurston's inequality lemma 4.4, this implies that the volume of \u03c3m\ntends to zero. This is again a contradiction. QED\nThus, by proposition 4.1 and (4.2), the simplex \u03c3 = \u03c3(u1 , ..., un+1 ) has positive volume. This implies that \u03c3 is a non-degenerated n-simplex in Dn whose center is 0. Let \u03c7m\nand \u03c7 be the characteristic functions of \u03c3m and \u03c3 in D \u0304n . Then by definition, the function\n\u03c7\nto \u03c7 in Dn . Furthermore, by proposition 4.1, the integral\nR\nR m converges almost everywhere\n\u03c7 dv converges to Dn \u03c7dv where dv is the hyperbolic volume element in Dn . By\nDn m\nFatou's lemma (see for instance [Roy], p86, problem 9), this implies that for any ball of\nradius R centered at 0, vol(\u03c3m \u2212 BR (0)) converges to vol(\u03c3 \u2212 BR (0)). Choose R so large\nthat vol(\u03c3 \u2212 BR (0)) \u2264 \u01eb0 /2. Then for m large, we have vol(\u03c3m \u2212 BR (0)) < \u01eb0 . But this\ncontradicts (4.3) for m large. QED\n4.3. A Proof of Proposition 4.1.\nBy the work of Ratcliffe [Ra], it suffices to show the proposition in two cases. In the\nfirst case, the number of elements in the set {u1 , ..., un+1} is between 3 and n. In the second\ncase, {u1 , u2 , ..., un+1} consists of two elements {p, q}, p 6= q, so that both sets {i|ui = p}\nand {j|uj = q} contain at least two points. The goal is to show that limm\u2212>\u221e vol(\u03c3m ) = 0\nin both cases.\nThe proposition holds for n = 2. Indeed, in this case, u1 , u2 , u3 are pairwise distinct.\nThus the result was proved by Ratcliffe. Assume from now on that n \u2265 3.\nFirst of all, we claim\nClaim. If ui = uj for i 6= j so that ui is in Dn , then limm\u2212>\u221e vol(\u03c3m ) = 0.\nIndeed, by lemma 4.4, we can estimate vol(\u03c3m ) \u2264 1/(n \u2212 1)!vol1 (vi (m), vj (m)). Now\nvol1 (vi (m), vj (m)) = d(vi (m), vj (m)) tends to d(ui , uj ) = 0.\nBy this claim, we may assume from now on that if ui = uj , i 6= j, then ui \u2208 S n\u22121 .\nBy the assumption on {u1 , ..., un+1 }, we may choose four points, say u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 so\nthat u1 = u2 and either u3 = u4 6= u1 , or {u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 } consists of three points. By\n15\n\n\flemma 4.4, we have vol(\u03c3m ) \u2264 1/((n \u2212 1)...4.3)vol3 (C(v1 (m), v2 (m), v3 (m), v4 (m))). This\nimplies that it suffices to prove the proposition for n = 3 which we will assume.\nTo prove the proposition, there are two cases to be considered: case 1, all ui 's are in\nS 2 , and case 2, some ui 's are in D3 .\nIn the first case that all ui 's are in S 2 , let w1 (m), ..., w4(m) be four points in S 2 so\nthat v1 (m), v3 (m) lie in the geodesic from w1 (m) to w3 (m) and v2 (m), v4 (m) lie in the\ngeodesic from w2 (m) to w4 (m). We choose w1 (m) to be the end point in the ray from\nv3 (m) to v1 (m) and w2 (m) similarly. By the construction, we still have limm\u2192\u221e wi (m) =\nui for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Furthermore, by the construction C(w1 (m), ..., w4(m)) contains the\ntetrahedron C(v1 (m), v2 (m), v3 (m), v4 (m)). In particular,\nvol(C(v1 (m), ..., v4(m))) \u2264 vol(C(w1 (m), ..., w4 (m))).\nNow, the volume of the ideal tetrahedra C(w1 (m), ..., w4(m)) can be calculated from the\ncross ratio of the four vertices w1 (m), ..., w4 (m). To be more precise, by [Th], the volume\nof an ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron with vertices z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 \u2208 C depends continuously on\nz2 \u2212z3\n3\nthe cross raio [z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ] = zz11 \u2212z\n\u2212z4 : z2 \u2212z4 . In particular, if the cross ratio tends to 0, 1,\nor \u221e, then the volume tends to 0. In our case, by the assumption, we see that the cross\nratio of (w1 (m), w2 (m), w3 (m), w4 (m)) tends to the cross ration of u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 which is\n0, 1, or \u221e. Thus the volume vol3 (C(v1 (m), v2 (m), v3 (m), v4 (m))) tends to 0.\nIn the second case that one of the points of {u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 } is in D3 , by the above\nclaim, we may assume that u1 = u2 is in S 2 . Furthermore, by the claim, we may assume\nthat u3 6= u4 and u3 \u2208 D3 . Note that u4 6= u1 . Let w1 (m), ..., w4(m) be four points in S 2\nconstructed as in the previous paragraph. By the construction C(w1 (m), ..., w4(m)) contains the tetrahedron C(v1 (m), v2 (m), v3 (m), v4 (m)). Furthermore, we have limm w1 (m) =\nlimm w2 (m) = u1 , and limm w3 (m) = w3 and limm w4 (m) = w4 both exist so that\nthe cross ration of {u1 , u1 , w3 , w4 } is 0, 1, or \u221e. Thus by case 1, we see that the\nvolume of C(w1 (m), ..., w4 (m)) tends to zero. This in turn implies that the volume of\nC(v1 (m), ..., v4 (m)) tends to zero. This finishes the proof.\n4.4. A Proof of Proposition 4.2\nSuppose otherwise, there is \u01eb0 > 0, a sequence of hyperbolic n-simplices \u03c3m = C(v1 (m), ...,\nvn+1 (m)) with center 0 in Dn so that the radius of \u03c3m is at most 1/m and its volume vol(\u03c3m ) \u2265 \u01eb0 . By taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that the limit\nlimm\u2192\u221e vi (m) = ui exists in D \u0304n . Then by lemma 4.5 and proposition 4.1, we conclude that \u03c3 = C(u1 , ..., un+1 ) is a non-degenerate generalized n-simplex. In particular,\nthese vectors u1 , ..., un+1 are linearly independent in Rn+1 . On the other hand, since\nthe radius of \u03c3m tends to zero, we see that all codimension-1 totally geodesic surfaces\nsp{u1 , ..., ui\u22121 , ui+1 , ..., un+1 } contain 0. This is impossible for a non-degenerated simplex.\nQED\n4.4. A Proof of Lemma 4.3\nSuppose otherwise, there exist \u03b40 >, r0 > 0, a sequence of n-simplices {\u03c3m |m \u2208 Z\u22651 } of\nradius at least \u03b40 , and a point xm \u2208 \u03c3m so that\n16\n\n\f(4.4) xm is within r0 distance to each codimension-1 totally geodesic surface containing a\ncodimension-1 face of \u03c3m , and,\n(4.5) d(xm , cm ) \u2265 m where cm is the center of \u03c3m .\n\nLet us put the center cm of \u03c3m to be the origin 0 of Dn . By chosing a subsequence\nif necessary, we may assume that \u03c3m = C(v1 (m), ..., vn+1 (m)) so that limm\u2192\u221e vi (m) = ui\nexists in D \u0304n , and limm\u2192\u221e xm = x also exists in D \u0304n . Since the radius of \u03c3m is bounded\naway from zero, we apply lemma 4.5 and proposition 4.1 to conclude that the simplex\n\u03c3 = C(u1 , ..., un+1 ) is non-degenerated whose center is 0. Since d(xm , 0) \u2265 m, it follows that x has to be one of the vertex, say u1 of \u03c3. Now consider the upper-half\nspace model U n for the hyperbolic space so that u1 = x is the infinity and the totally geodesic codimension-1\ncontaining u2 , ..., un+1 is the unit upper hemi-sphere\nPsurface\nn\nn\u22121\nn\n2\nS+ = {(t1 , ..., tn) \u2208 R | i=1 ti = 1, tn > 0}. Let the center of the simplex \u03c3 in this\nn\u22121\nmodel be C and the point of the shortest distance to C in S+\nbe P . We claim that the\n6\nangle P Cu1 at C is at least \u03c0/2. This follows from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Let U 2\nbe the unique 2-dimensional hyperbolic plane containing C and u1 so that U 2 is perpenn\u22121\nn\u22121\ndicular to S+\n. Let Q = [0, ..., 0, 1]t be the north pole in S+\n. Then by the construction,\nQ \u2208 U 2 and P \u2208 U 2 due to the orthogonality. If P = Q, then the angle 6 P Cu1 is \u03c0.\nThe claim follows. If otherwise, consider the hyperbolic quadrilateral QP Cu1 in U 2 . The\nangle of the quadrilateral at Q, P and u1 are \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 and 0 respectively. On the other\nhand, since C is the center of the simplex \u03c3, the complete geodesic from u1 to C intersects\nn\u22121\nthe hemi-sphere S+\nat some point, say R. Thus the quadrilateral QP Cu1 is inside the\nhyperbolic triangle \u2206u1 QR whose inner angles are \u03c0/2, 0, \u03b8. In particular, the area of this\ntriangle is less than \u03c0/2 by the Gauss-Bonnet formula. This implies that the area of the\nquadrilateral QP Cu1 is at most \u03c0/2. By Gauss-Bonnet formula, we conclude that the\nangle 6 P Cu1 at C is at least \u03c0/2.\nOn the other hand, we will derive from (4.4) and (4.5) that the angle 6 P Cu1 is strictly\nless than \u03c0/2. Thus we arrive a contradiction. To see this, let Pm be the point in the\ntotally geodesic codimension-1 surface sp(C(v2 (m), ..., vn+1 (m))) which is closest to the\ncenter cm of \u03c3m . By the construction, the limit of the angle 6 Pm cm xm is equal to 6 P Cu1 .\nTo estimate the angle 6 Pm cm xm , consider the two-dimensional totally geodesic plane Dm\nwhich contains cm and xm so that Dm is perpendicular to sp(C(v2 (m), ..., vn+1 (m))). By\nthe construction Pm is in the plane Dm . Let Rm be the point in sp(C(v2 (m), ..., vn+1 (m)) of\nthe shortest distance to xm . Then we again have Rm is in Dm . Consider the quadrilateral\nPm Rm xm cm in the plane Dm . The angles at the vertices Pm and Rm are \u03c0/2. The\ndistances d(cm , Pm ) \u2265 \u03b40 , d(xm , Rm ) \u2264 r0 and d(cm , xm ) \u2265 m. Thus, as m becomes large,\nthe quadrilateral is tending to a right angled hyperbolic triangle with one vertex at infinity\n(corresponding to Rm and xm ). There is an edge of the triangle having finite length which\nis at least \u03b40 (corresponding to the edge between cm and Pm ). The accue angle at the end\npoint of this finite length edge is at most \u03b8 = arcsin(1/ cosh(\u03b40 )) < \u03c0/2 by the cosine law.\nThus, as m tends to infinity, the angle 6 Pm cm xm tends to a number less than or equal to\n\u03b8. In particular, the angle 6 Pm cm xm is strictly less than \u03c0/2 for m large. This contradicts\nthe previous conclusion. QED\nAppendix, A Proof of Lemma 3.2\n17\n\n\fWe give a proof of the following lemma used in the paper.\nLemma 3.2. Given a symmetric n \u00d7 n matrix A of signature (k, 0) or (k, 1), and \u01eb > 0,\nthere exists a positive diagonal matrix D so that |D \u2212 Id| \u2264 \u01eb and all non-zero eigenvalues\nof DAD are simple.\nProof. For of all, it suffices to find a positive diagonal matrix D so that all non-zero\neigenvalues of DAD are simple. This is due to the fact from algebraic geometry that an\nalgebraic subvariety in Rm is either the whole space or has zero Lebesgue measure. By\n[Fr], the set of all diagonal matrices D so that DAD has a non-simple non-zero eigenvalue\nforms an algebraic variety X in Rm . Thus, as long as X 6= Rm , we can pick D in Rm\nwithin \u01eb distance to [1, ...., 1]t so that D \u2208\n/ X.\nNext, we claim that it suffices to prove the lemma for n\u00d7n matrix A so that det(A) 6= 0.\nIndeed, if k = rank(A), due to the fact that A is diagonal, A has exactly k non-zero\neigenvalues counted with multiplicity and A has a non-singular principal k \u00d7k submatrix B\nformed by i1 , ..., ik -th rows and columns of A. For simplicity, we assume that B is formed by\nthe first k rows and columns of A. Then by the result for non-singular symmetric matrix,\nwe find a positive diagonal matrix D1 = diag(a1 , ..., ak ) so that D1 BD1 has k distinct\neigenvalues. Consider the n \u00d7 n matrix D(t) = diag(a1 , ..., ak , t, t, ..., t) where t > 0. For t\nsmall, by theorem 2.7, the eigenvalues of D(t)AD(t) are close to the eigenvalues of D1 BD1\nand 0. Since D1 BD1 has k distinct non-zero eigenvalues, this implies that D(t)AD(t) has\nk distinct non-zero eigenvalue for t small.\nFinally, we prove the lemma for non-singular matrices using induction on the size of\nthe matrix. The result clearly holds for 1 \u00d7 1 and 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. Suppose A is a nonsingular n \u00d7 n matrix for n \u2265 3. Let B the principal submatrix of A obtained by removing\nthe last column and the last row. Then the signature of B is either (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 1, 0) or\n(n \u2212 2, 0). By the induction hypothesis and the argument in the previous paragraph, we\nfind a positive diagonal matrix D1 = diag(a1 , ..., an\u22121) so that all (n \u2212 1)-eigenvalues of\nB are distinct. Let us denote the eigenvalues of B by \u03bb1 > ... > \u03bbn\u22121 . Now consider the\npositive diagonal matrix D(t) = diag(a1 , ..., an\u22121, t) for t > 0. For t small, the eigenvalues\n\u03bc1 (t) \u2265 \u03bc2 (t) \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03bcn (t) of D(t)AD(t) is close to {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn\u22121 , 0}. We claim that for\nt small D(t)AD(t) has n distinct eigenvalues. Indeed, if B is non-singular, i.e., the set\n{\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn\u22121 , 0} consists of n distinct elements, then for t > 0 small, \u03bci (t) 6= \u03bcj (t) for\ni 6= j. If B is singular, then B is semi-positive definite of rank n \u2212 2. Furthermore, this\nimplies that A has signature (n \u22121, 1). In particular, D(t)AD(t) has a negative eigenvalue,\ni.e., \u03bcn (t) < 0. Now for t small, we conclude that \u03bc1 (t), ..., \u03bcn\u22121(t) are positive and are\nclose to the set of n \u2212 1 distinct numbers {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn\u22122, 0} where \u03bbi > 0. This implies that\nfor t > 0 small, the eigenvalues \u03bc1 (t), ..., \u03bcn\u22121(t) are positive and pairwsie distinct. Since\nthe smallest eigenvalue \u03bcn (t) < 0, we conclude that D(t)AD(t) has n distinct eigenvalues.\nReferences\n[Ao] Aomoto, Kazuhiko: Analytic structure of Schlfli function.
