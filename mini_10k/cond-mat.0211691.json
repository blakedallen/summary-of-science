Introduction\nCoherent and quantum phenomena are often treated as antagonists, since the former are,\nto some extent, close to classical ones1 . When describing one of these phenomena, one usually\nemploys rather different approximations. For example, a very common way of considering\ncoherent phenomena is by invoking the semiclassical approximation, which makes it possible\nto give a transparent picture of such phenomena. But the semiclassical approximation kills\nall quantum correlations, eliminating by this all quantum effects. Such a neglection of the\nlatter may be admissible if the studied coherent process is stationary or a strong coherence\nis imposed on the system by an external field. However, if one investigates a self-organized\ngrowth of coherence and when the coherent phenomena are transient or intermittent, then\nquantum effects may essentially influence the features of coherent phenomena. In that case, it\nis necessary to take account of both types of effects. For this purpose, one may resort to the\nconsideration of higher-order correlation functions. But then, the evolution equations become\nso much complicated that essentially nonstationary states are hardly treatable.\nIn this report, a method is presented, which combines the transparency of the semiclassical\napproximation with the possibility of taking account of quantum effects. The idea of the\n1\n\n\fmethod reminds, to some extent, quantization of soliton solutions in quantum field theory2 .\nBut the most important concept of the method is the notice that quantum and coherent effects\noccur on rather different scales. Quantum effects are usually connected with short-range fast\nfluctuations, while coherent phenomena are mainly long-range in space and slow in time, as\ncompared to the quantum ones. The occurrence of different spatio-temporal scales allows the\ndevelopment of Scale Separation Approach3\u22127 . The general idea of separating different scales\nis, of course, known. However, its realization, as applied to optics in the report below is new.\nThe pivotal novel technique is Quantization of Local Fluctuations.\n\n2. Resonant Atoms in Matter\nThe system of resonant atoms inside matter is described by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u0124a + \u0124f + \u0124m + \u0124af + \u0124mf .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the first term\n\u0124a =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c90\n\ni=1\n\n\u0012\n\nSiz\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nis the Hamiltonian of resonant atoms, with transition frequency \u03c90 , where Si\u03b1 are pseudospin\noperators. The field Hamiltonian is\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n1\n(3)\nE2 + B2 dr .\n8\u03c0\nThe Gaussian system of units is used, with setting h\u0304 \u2261 1. Electric and magnetic fields are\nexpressed through the vector potential,\n\n\u0124f =\n\n1 \u2202A\n,\nB=\u2207\u00d7A.\nc \u2202t\nThe Coulomb gauge \u2207 * A = 0 will be employed. This calibration is convenient for eliminating\nfield variables in the following evolution operations. The Hamiltonian \u0124m models the material\nincorporating the atoms. The atom-field interaction is presented by the dipole Hamiltonian\nE=\u2212\n\n\u0124af = \u2212\n\nN \u0012\nX\n1\n\nc\n\nn=1\n\nJi * Ai + Pi * E0i\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nin which Ai \u2261 A(ri , t) is the vector-potential operator, E0i \u2261 E0 (ri , t) is a classical external\nfield. The transition current and transition dipole operators are\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nJi = i\u03c90 dSi+ \u2212 d\u2217 Si\u2212 ,\n\nPi = dSi+ + d\u2217 Si\u2212 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere d is a transition dipole and Si\u00b1 \u2261 Six \u00b1 iSiy . Finally, the matter-field interaction is\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124mf\n\n1\n=\u2212\nc\n\nZ\n\njm (r, t) * A(r, t) dr ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fin which jm (r, t) is a local density of current in matter.\nThe Heisenberg equations of motion for the pseudospin operators yield the equation\ndSi\u2212\n= \u2212i\u03c90 Si\u2212 + 2 (k0 d * Ai \u2212 id * E0i ) Siz\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nfor the lowering operator and the Hermitian conjugated equation for the rising operator, with\nk0 \u2261 \u03c90 /c. The equation for the population-difference operator is\ndSiz\n= \u2212 (k0 d * Ai \u2212 id * E0i ) Si+ \u2212 (k0 d\u2217 * Ai + id\u2217 * E0i ) Si\u2212 .\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nIn deriving an equation for the vector potential, one has to use the commutation relations\nh\n\ni\n\nE \u03b1 (r, t), A\u03b2 (r\u2032 , t) = 4\u03c0ic\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\u2032 ) ,\n\nwhere\n\n1\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r) \u2261\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\nk \u03b1 k \u03b2 ik * r\ne\ndk\n\u2212\nk2\n!\n\nis the so-called transverse delta-function1 . These commutation relations explicitly take into\naccount the Coulomb gauge condition. The transverse delta-function can be presented in other\nforms, as\nZ\neik*r\n\u22022\ndk ,\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(r) + \u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2202r \u2202r\n(2\u03c0)3 k 2\nor as\n2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 3n\u03b1 n\u03b2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(r) \u2212\n,\n3\n4\u03c0r 3\nwhere n\u03b1 \u2261 r \u03b1 /r. As a result, for the vector potential one has\n4\u03c0\n1 \u22022\nj,\n\u22072 \u2212 2 2 A = \u2212\nc \u2202t\nc\n!\n\n(9)\n\nwith the density of current\n\u03b1\n\nj (r, t) =\n\n\"N\nX X\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r \u2212\n\nr\u2032i )Ji\u03b2 (t)\n\n+\n\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r \u2212 r\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b2\n)jm\n(r\u2032 , t)\n\ndr\n\n\u2032\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe solution to Eq. (9) reads\n1\nA(r, t) = Avac (r, t) +\nc\n\nZ\n\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nj r ,t\u2212\nc\n\u2032\n\n!\n\ndr\u2032\n,\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\n(11)\n\nwith Avac being the solution of the uniform equation related to Eq. (9). Note that the dipolar\npart of the transverse delta-function, being averaged over space, yileds zero, that is\nZ\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (r) dr =\n3\n\n2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .\n3\n\n\fThis anisotropic dipolar part, for simplicity, can be omitted. Then the vector potential (11)\ntakes the form\nA = Avac + Arad + Amat ,\n(12)\nin which the term\nArad (ri , t) =\n\nN\nX\n\nrij\n2\nJj t \u2212\n3crij\nc\nj(6=i)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nis due to radiating atoms and the potential\n2\nAmat (r, t) =\n3c\n\nZ\n\njm\n\n1\nr , t \u2212 |r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\ndr\u2032\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\nis caused by matter currents. Here rij \u2261 |rij |, rij \u2261 ri \u2212rj . The summation over j = 1, 2, . . . , N\ndoes not include the term with j = i corresponding to self-action, which will be taken into\naccount by incorporating the level and line widths in the evolution equations.\nIt is important to notice that all processes are defined for t \u2265 0, while in the expressions\nabove there appears the dependence of operators on the difference t \u2212 t\u2032 , which may be negative. Therefore it is necessary to complete the definition of quasispin operators by adding the\nretardation condition\nSj\u2212 (t) = 0\n(t < 0) .\n(13)\nThe dependence of Sj\u2212 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) on the retarded time can also be simplified by taking into account\nthat the interaction of radiation with atoms is to be essentially weaker than intra-atomic interactions. In the other case, the very notion of resonant atoms, having a well-defined transition\nfrequency, would not have sense. Then, Eq. (7) shows that Sj\u2212 (t) \u223c exp(\u2212i\u03c90 t). Combining\nthis with the retardation condition (13) gives\nSj\u2212 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = \u0398(t \u2212 t\u2032 )Sj\u2212 (t) exp(i\u03c90 t\u2032 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nHence for the typical dependence on the retarded variables, one has\nSj\u2212\n\nrij\nt\u2212\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u0398(ct \u2212 rij )Sj\u2212 (t) exp(ik0 rij ) .\n\n(15)\n\nSuch a simplification, combining the Born approximation with the retardation condition (13),\ncan be called the Retarded Born Approximation.\nIt is worth mentioning that it is sufficient to understand all operator equations in the weak\nsense, as the equations for appropriate matrix elements or averages.\n\n3. Separation of Local Fields\nThe influence of vacuum and matter on an atom enters the evolution equations through the\nexpression\n\u03be(r, t) \u2261 2k0 d * (Avac + Amat ) .\n(16)\n4\n\n\fActually, electromagnetic vacuum and matter form an effective vacuum acting on an atom by\nmeans of the local field (16). Thus, one may say that there are two types of operator variables,\nthe quasispin variables and the local field (16). An operator F\u0302 , being a function of these\nvariables, can, for brevity, be written as F\u0302 (S, \u03be), with S denoting the quasispin set {Si\u03b1 } and\n\u03be, the set {\u03be(r, t)} of local fields at different points r. According to the existence of two types\nof variables, one may define two kinds of statistical averages over the related variables, either\nquasispin or local-field ones. Such partial averages are defined by means of the corresponding\nrestricted traces, either\n< F\u0302 > \u2261 TrS \u03c1\u0302F\u0302 (S, \u03be) ,\n(17)\nwith \u03c1\u0302 being a statistical operator, or\n\u226a F\u0302 \u226b \u2261 Tr\u03be \u03c1\u0302F\u0302 (S, \u03be) .\n\n(18)\n\nWhen averaging over quasispin variables, one may assume the validity of the mean-field\ndecoupling\n< Si\u03b1 Sj\u03b2 > = < Si\u03b1 >< Sj\u03b2 >\n(i 6= j) ,\n(19)\nsince atoms interact with each other through effective long-range forces. This decoupling is not\nequivalent to the semiclassical approximation as the local-field variables have not been involved.\nThen the atomic average < Si\u03b1 > is, actually, an operator function of local fields. The latter\ndescribe local quantum fluctuations.\nFor what follows, it is convenient to use the notation Si\u03b1 (t) \u2261 S \u03b1 (ri , t).

Expressions (34) are to be substituted in Eqs. (28) to (30).\nEquation (28) is multiplied by e\u2212ikz and then all equations are averaged over space.

Method of Stochastic Averaging\nTo simplify further the evolution equations (38) to (40), one can take into consideration the\nexistence of several small parameters, such as\n\u03b31\n\u03b32\n\u03b30\n\u226a1,\n\u226a1,\n\u226a1.\n(41)\n\u03c90\n\u03c90\n\u03c90\nThe amplitude of the external field (31) is assumed to be small, so that\n|\u03bd1 |\n\u226a1,\n\u03c90\n\n\u03bd1 \u2261 d * E1 .\n7\n\n(42)\n\n\fAlso, the local quantum field \u03be is treated as weak, in the sense that its first and second moments\nare proportional to values much smaller than \u03c90 . Then the multiscale averaging technique can\nbe generalized3\u22127 to stochastic and operator equations, as Eqs. (38) to (40). The occurrence of\nthe above small parameters shows that the functions w(t) and s(t) are temporal quasi-invariants\nwith respect to the fast function u(t).\nEquation (38) for the fast function, with w and s being quasi-invariants, can be solved.\nTo this end, let us introduce the collective width and collective frequency by the corresponding\nexpressions\n\u0393 \u2261 \u03b32 \u2212 \u03b1s ,\n\u03a9 \u2261 \u03c90 + \u03b2s ,\n(43)\nand also, let us define the dynamical detuning\n\u03b4 \u2261 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9 = \u2206 \u2212 \u03b2s .\n\n(44)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (38) reads\n\u0012\n\nu = u0 \u2212\n\n\u03bd1 s\n\u03bd1 s \u2212i\u03c9t\ne\u2212(i\u03a9+\u0393)t +\ne\n+s\n\u03b4 + i\u0393\n\u03b4 + i\u0393\n\u0013\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03be(t\u2032 )e\u2212(i\u03a9+\u0393)(t\u2212t ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(45)\n\nTo simplify the following formulas, it is convenient to choose the phase of E1 so that to eliminate\nthe dependence on the transverse initial value u0 . For this purpose, the phase of E1 is taken so\nthat u\u22170 d * E1 be real, which writes\nu\u22170 \u03bd1 = u0 \u03bd1\u2217 .\n(46)\nThe solution (45) is to be substituted into Eqs. (39) and (40), whose right-hand sides are\nto be averaged according to the prescription\n1 ZT\n\u226a F (\u03be, t) \u226b dt ,\n\u226a F \u226b = lim\nT \u2192\u221e T\n0\nwhere the integration over time does not touch quasi-invariants. The quantum field \u03be(t) is\ncentered so that\n\u226a \u03be(t) \u226b = 0 .\n(47)\nTo make the resulting expressions less cumbersome, let us consider the case of small detuning\n|\u03b4| < |\u0393|, when \u03b4 can be omitted in the phase dependence, though should be kept in denominators to avoid spurious poles. In the process of the averaging, one obtains the effective\nattenuation\n\u0011\n|\u03bd1 |2 \u0393 \u0010\n\u2212\u0393t\n\u0393\u0303 \u2261 2\n+ \u03933 ,\n(48)\n1\n\u2212\ne\n\u03b4 + \u03932\nwhere the first term is due to the classical external field (31) and the quantum attenuation\n\u03933 \u2261 Re lim\n\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n1\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u226a \u03be + (t)\u03be(t\u2032 ) \u226b e\u2212(i\u03a9+\u0393)(t\u2212t ) dt\u2032\n\nappears because of the action of the quantum field \u03be(t).\n8\n\n(49)\n\n\fEquations (39) and (40) reduce to the evolution equations\nds\n= \u2212\u03b1w \u2212 \u0393\u0303s \u2212 \u03b31 (s \u2212 \u03b6) ,\ndt\n\ndw\n= \u22122(\u03b32 \u2212 \u03b1s)w + 2\u0393\u0303s2 ,\ndt\n\n(50)\n\ndescribing the coherent guiding centers. In order to make these equations complete, it is\nnecessary to define the quantum correlation function \u226a \u03be + (t)\u03be(t\u2032 ) \u226b entering the quantum\nattenuation (49).\n\n6. Examples of Quantum Attenuation\nTo make it clear how the quantum attenuation (49) can be calculated, let us give some\nexamples of defining the quantum variable \u03be(t).\nThe first simple case could be by considering the variable \u03be(t) as random, associated to\ninfrared noise characterized by\n\u226a \u03be + (t)\u03be(t\u2032) \u226b = \u03b332 .\n(51)\nThen Eq. (49) yields\n\u03b332 \u0393\n.\n(52)\n\u03a92 + \u03932\nThe opposite case would be to treat \u03be(t) as a stochastic variable representing white noise,\nwith\n\u226a \u03be + (t)\u03be(t\u2032) \u226b = 2\u03933 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n(53)\n\u03933 =\n\nwhich results in the identity \u03933 = \u03933 .\nA more elaborate modelling of the effective quantum fluctuations is by a system of oscillators, yielding\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u03be(t) =\n(54)\n\u03b3(\u03c9q ) bq e\u2212i\u03c9q t + b\u2020q ei\u03c9q t ,\nq\n\nwhere \u03c9q = \u03c9\u2212q > 0. For the Bose operators bq and b\u2020q , statistical averaging gives\n\u226a bq \u226b = 0 ,\n\n\u226a b\u2020q bp \u226b = nq \u03b4qp ,\n\n\u226a bq b\u2020p \u226b = (1 + nq )\u03b4qp ,\n\n(55)\n\nwith nq being a momentum distribution function. The averages \u226a bq bq \u226b and \u226a b\u2020q b\u2020q \u226b in\nthe case of normal effective vacuum are zero, while for a squeezed vacuum\n\u226a b\u2020q b\u2020p \u226b = mq \u2206(\u03c9q + \u03c9p \u2212 2\u03c9s ) ,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the function mq is defined by the particular properties of a squeezed vacuum, and \u2206(\u03c9)\nis the discrete delta-function\n\u2206(\u03c9) \u2261\n\n(\n\n1, \u03c9=0\n0 , \u03c9 6= 0 .\n\n9\n\n\fThe spectral function \u03b3(\u03c9) in Eq. (54) is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the central\nline, so that\n\u03b3(\u03c9s + \u03c9q ) = \u03b3(\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9q ) .\nSuch an effective squeezed vacuum can be realized if atoms are inserted into a medium with\nsqueezed collective excitations interacting with electromagnetic field. These excitations could\nbe squeezed optical phonons or magnons. The interaction of the latter with photons results in\nthe formation of squeezed polaritons.\nFor the quantum field (54), the correlation function is\n\u226a \u03be + (t)\u03be(t\u2032 ) \u226b =\n\nX\n\nh\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b3 2 (\u03c9q ) nq ei\u03c9q (t\u2212t ) + (1 + nq )e\u2212i\u03c9q (t\u2212t ) +\n\nq\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n+mq ei\u03c9q t+i(2\u03c9s \u2212\u03c9q )t + m\u2217q e\u2212i\u03c9q t\u2212i(2\u03c9s \u2212\u03c9q )t\n\ni\n\n.\n\n(57)\n\nCalculating the quantum attenuation (49), we keep in mind that nq \u2261 n(\u03c9q ) is real, while\nmq \u2261 m(\u03c9q ) is, in general, complex,\nm(\u03c9) = |m(\u03c9)|ei\u03c6s .\nThe final formulas will be simplified by remembering that |\u03b4| \u2261 |\u03c9 \u2212\u03a9| \u226a \u03c9. Then substituting\nthe correlation function (57) into Eq. (49), one finds\n\u03933 = \u0393\n\nX\nq\n\n\u03b3 2 (\u03c9)\u0393 \u2212\u0393t\n1 + nq\nnq\n\u2212\nn(\u03c9)\n+\ne\n+ \u0393s ,\n\u03b3 (\u03c9q )\n(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9q )2 + \u03932 (\u03a9 + \u03c9q )2 + \u03932\n\u03b4 2 + \u03932\n2\n\n#\n\n(58)\n\n\u0393 cos \u03c6s + 2\u03c9s sin \u03c6s \u2212\u0393t\ne\n.\n4\u03c9s2 + \u03932\n\n(59)\n\n\"\n\nwith the last term being due to the squeezing,\n\u0393s = \u2212|m(\u03c9)|\u03b3 2 (\u03c9)\n\nThe quantity (59) may be named the squeezing attenuation.\nSeparating out of the quantum attenuation (58) its resonant part, one has\n\u0393res\n\n\u0011\n\u03b3 2 (\u03c9)\u0393 \u0010\n\u2212\u0393t\n.\n= n(\u03c9) 2\n1\n\u2212\ne\n\u03b4 + \u03932\n\n(60)\n\nAs is seen, the resonant attenuation (60) is zero at t = 0. This means that, at the initial time,\nthe main role in the quantum attenuation is played by its nonresonant parts, including the\nsqueezing attenuation.\nTo complete this section, it is useful to present explicit examples of n(\u03c9) and |m(\u03c9)| in the\ncase of a squeezed effective vacuum. The latter can be generated by a parametric oscillator1 ,\nwith a squeezing field proportional to \u03b5 cos(2\u03c9s t + \u03c6s ). One employs the notation \u03bc \u2261 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b5 and\n\n10\n\n\f\u03bd \u2261 \u03b3 + \u03b5, where \u03b3 is a cavity damping rate.

If the parametric oscillator is weakly nondegenerate, with |\u03ba| \u226a |\u2206s |, or\ndegenerate, then\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03bc2\nn(\u03c9) =\n4\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 2\n2\n2\n\u2206s + \u03bc\n\u2206s + \u03bd 2\n\n!\n\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03bc2\n|m(\u03c9)| =\n4\n\n,\n\n1\n1\n+ 2\n2\n2\n\u2206s + \u03bc\n\u2206s + \u03bd 2\n\n!\n\n.\n\nBy means of different parametric oscillators, it is possible to generate squeezed fields with\nvarious characteristics.\n\n7. Conclusion\nThe method, presented in this report, makes it possible to combine the clarity of the semiclassical approximation with taking account of quantum effects. The latter are responsible for\nthe appearance of a specific quantum attenuation. The vacuum electromagnetic field interacting with matter forms an effective quantum vacuum. Preparing different kinds of such vacua,\none can regulate the value of the quantum attenuation. The latter, in its turn, can essentially\ninfluence the features of the following coherent processes.\nNotice that the squeezing attenuation (59) can change sign for the varying phase \u03c6s . Thus,\n\u0393s < 0 for \u03c6s = 0, \u03c0/2.\nFor preparing different types of effective vacua, one may incorporate resonant atoms into\ndifferent media. There exists a rich variety of materials possessing various properties, which\ncould be used for creating effective vacua with divers specific features. Just as a few cases\nof materials with interesting electromagnetic properties, one may mention biopolymers with\nphotoexcited polar vibrations8 , photonic crystals with two-photon transitions9 , and plausible\ninverted superconductors10 .\nThe feasibility of influencing coherent processes by quantum effects opens a novel way of\nregulating the characteristics of collective atomic radiation.\n\nReferences\n11\n\n\f[1] L.
