The domain of the field quantities is extended by the set of\nmesoscopic variables, here the velocities of the components. Balance\nequations on this enlarged space are the equations of motion for the\nmesoscopic fields. Moreover, local distribution functions of the velocities are introduced as a statistical element, and an equation of motion\nfor this distribution function is derived. From this equation of motion\ndifferential equations for the diffusion fluxes, and also for higher order\nfluxes are obtained. These equations are of balance type, as it is postulated in Extended Thermodynamics. The resulting evolution equation\nfor the diffusion flux generalizes the Fick's law.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost phenomena involving mass diffusion are described by means of Fick's\nlaw which relates linearly the mass flow to the gradient of the mass concentration through the diffusion coefficient. In practical applications Fick's law\nis satisfactory to a large extent. However, it is not applicable to transitory\nsituations involving for instance high frequencies. The mass balance together\nwith Ficks law leads to parabolic differential equations for the concentrations, allowing for infinite velocities of propagation of disturbances. The last\nparadox must be overcome by considering non-Fickian transport behavior\nfor the diffusive mass flux. A possible solution is given in Extended Thermodynamics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The diffusion flux is introduced as an additional\n1\n\n\f2\nfield variable, obeying a differential equation. This differential equation is\nderived either from an Irreversible Thermodynamics treatment [6, 7] of the\ndissipation inequality (for other applications see [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]), or a\nbalance type equation for the non-convective fluxes, here the diffusion flux, is\npostulated in Rational Extended Thermodynamics [14, 5, 15]. For a purely\nmacroscopic derivation of balance type differential equations for higher order fluxes see [16, 17]. Within Rational Extended Thermodynamics it has\nbeen shown that the resulting system of field equations is symmetric hyperbolic with a convex extension [18, 5, 19], thereby allowing for finite speeds\nof disturbances only [20, 21, 18].\nA foundation of the field equations of Extended Thermodynamics has\nbeen given from statistical mechanics. In most cases the single particle distribution function is used, together with Boltzmann-equation [5]. In this\ncase microscopic interactions are introduced via the collision term in the\nBoltzmann-equation. However, Boltzmann-equation is, strictly speaking,\nvalid only for dilute gases, and for liquids or solids a different foundation\nis necessary. Such a background theory can be given using the BBGKYhierarchy ([22, 23, 24, 25]) for the hierarchy of N-particle distribution functions. The structure of the field equations of Extended Thermodynamics\ncould be derived from this statistical mechanics background. Such an approach necessitates the knowledge of microscopic inter-particle interaction\npotentials.\nAn approach, different from microscopic statistical mechanics, is the so\ncalled mesoscopic theory [26, 29, 30]. It is a continuum theory, introducing constitutive functions on a continuum level, and no microscopic interparticle interactions. On the other hand the mesoscopic description is finer\nthan the macroscopic description. This additional information leads to the\ndefinition of internal variables in complex media, and to equations of motion for them. This mesoscopic concept has been applied to liquid crystals\n[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 27], to damage and fracture mechanics [37, 38], and to\ndipolar media [28]. We will show in the following that within the mesoscopic\ntheory a balance type equation for the diffusion flux can be derived.\nThe basic idea of the mesoscopic theory is to introduce an additional variable, the so-called mesoscopic variable, in the domain of the field quantities.\nOn this higher dimensional space a continuum theory is developed. In this\ntheory the mesoscopic field quantities depend not only on position and time,\nbut also on the mesoscopic variable. In addition a local distribution function\nof the mesoscopic variable is introduced as a statistical element. Macroscopic\nfields are the averages of mesoscopic ones over the additional (mesoscopic)\n\n\f3\nvariable.\nThe aim of this paper is the application of the mesoscopic concept to\nan N-component mixture and a derivation of differential equations for the\ndiffusion fluxes from the mesoscopic theory. The application of the resulting\nequations to fast phenomena, involving diffusion processes is left for future\nwork, as well as the investigation whether our generalized diffusion equation\nleads to hyperbolic field equations.\n\n2\n\nMesoscopic concept and balance equations\n\nThe mesoscopic concept introduces the mesoscopic space\n(m, x, t) \u2208 M \u00d7 R3x \u00d7 Rt\non which all field quantities are defined. Here m is a set of mesoscopic variables which is an element of a suitable manifold M on which an integration\ncan be defined. Beyond the use of additional variables m the mesoscopic concept introduces a statistical element, the so-called mesoscopic distribution\nfunction (MDF) f (m, x, t) generated by the different values of the mesoscopic variable of the particles in a volume element\nf (m, x, t) \u2261 f (*), (*) \u2261 (m, x, t) \u2208 M \u00d7 Rx3 \u00d7 Rt .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe MDF describes the distribution of m in a volume element around x at\ntime t, and therefore it is normalized\nZ\n\nf (m, x, t)dm = 1.\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt is the probability density of having the particular value m of the mesoscopic variable in the continuum element at position x and time t. Therefore\nit is the fraction\n\u03c1(m, x, t)\n.\n(2.3)\nf (m, x, t) =\n\u03c1(x, t)\nHere \u03c1(x, t) is the macroscopic mass density. By use of (2.2) we obtain\n\u03c1(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1(m, x, t)dm.\n\n(2.4)\n\n\f4\n\n2.1\n\nBalance equations\n\nLet G denote a region in R3 \u00d7M and X the density of an extensive quantity.\nThen the global quantity in the region G changes due to a flux over the\nboundary of G and due to production and supply within G:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\n3\n\u03a3X (*)d3 xdm .\n(2.5)\n\u03c6X (*)da +\nXd xdm =\ndt G\nG\n\u2202G\nA generalized Reynolds transport theorem in the mesoscopic space, analogous to the one in [39] is used to transform the time derivative, and Gauss\ntheorem is applied to the boundary integral. The boundary \u2202G of G consists\nof a boundary in position space and a boundary on the manifold M. Then\nwe have in regular points of the continuum the local mesoscopic balance [40]\n\u2202\nX(*) + \u2207x * [v(*)X(*) \u2212 S(*)] + \u2207m * [w(*)X(*) \u2212 R(*)] = \u03a3(*).\n\u2202t\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere the independent field w(*), defined on the mesoscopic space, describes\nthe change in time of the set of mesoscopic variables: With respect to m the\nmesoscopic change velocity w(*) is the analogue to the mesoscopic material\nvelocity v(*) referring to x: If a particle is characterized by (m, x, t), then\nfor \u2206t \u2192 +0 it is characterized by (m + w(*)\u2206t, x + v(*)\u2206t, t + \u2206t) at later\ntimes t + \u2206t. Besides the usual gradient, also the gradient with respect to\nthe set of mesoscopic variables appears. This expresses the fact that there\nis a flux over the boundary on the manifold M.\nAccording to equation (2.2) we obtain from the mesoscopic mass balance a\nbalance type differential equation for the MDF f (*) by inserting its definition\n[41, 30]:\n\u2202\nf (*) + \u2207x * [v(*)f (*)] + \u2207m * [w(*)f (*)] +\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\n+f (*)\n+ v(*) * \u2207x ln \u033a(x, t) = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\nApplication of the mesoscopic concept to mixtures\n\nLet us consider a mixture of N different chemical components. The different\ncomponents are distinguished by a component index in capital letters. We\nwill introduce velocity distributions of all chemical components, denoted f A .\nEach of them is a function of position of the respective continuum element,\n\n\f5\ntime, and particle velocity. f A (x, t, v) gives the probability density of finding\nthe value v for the material velocity of component A of the mixture in a\nvolume element around x at time t.\nThe mesoscopic mass densities and all other mesoscopic fields are different for different chemical components. Mesoscopic fields are denoted by a\n\"hat\", where this is necessary in order to distinguish them from the corresponding macroscopic quantities.\nThe distribution function f A is defined as follows:\nf A (x, t, v) =:\n\n\u03c1\u0302A (x, t, v)\n.\n\u03c1A (x, t)\n\n(3.1)\n\nf A (x, t, v)dv gives the fraction of particles of component A having a material\nvelocity in the element dv on R3v around v.\nThe distribution functions are normalized:\nZ\nf A (x, t, v)dv = 1, \u2200A .\n(3.2)\nR3v\n\n4\n\nMacroscopic balance equations for the mixture\nand its components\n\nIn this section, we shall recall briefly the macroscopic balance equations for\nmixtures and for the different components.\nThe total mass of a mixture is a conserved quantity, while the mass of\na particular component is not conserved, if chemical reactions occur. The\nsame happens for momentum, and energy due to chemical reactions between\ndifferent components of the mixture. Therefore, in the balance equations for\ncomponents there are production terms on the right hand side.\n\n4.1\n\nMacroscopic balance equations for the mixture\n\nThe balance equations for the mixture as a whole look the same as the\nbalance equations for a one-component system [42, 43]. From the structure of balance laws, mixtures cannot be distinguished from chemically pure\nsubstances.\nBalance of mass\n\u2202\u03c1\n(x, t) + \u2207 * (\u03c1v)(x, t) = 0\n\u2202t\n\n(4.1)\n\n\f6\nHere v is the macroscopic material velocity of the mixture, i.e., the barycentric velocity of all particles in the volume element.\nBalance of momentum\n\u2202\nT\n(\u03c1v) + \u2207 * (\u03c1v \u2297 v \u2212 t ) = \u03c1f ,\n(4.2)\n\u2202t\nwhere t denotes Cauchy stress tensor, and f is the acceleration (specific density of volume forces).

In this\nset of balance equations constitutive equations for the component stress\ntensor, component internal energy density, and heat flux density, and the\nproductions due to chemical reactions are needed in order to close the system\nof differential equations. These constitutive quantities must be related to\nthe wanted fields in a material dependent manner. The constitutive theory,\nincluding restrictions on constitutive functions from general principles, is\nout of the scope of the present paper.\nThe (total) energy density of the mixture is the sum over the components. From the additivity of the extensive quantities mass, momentum, and\nenergy follows that the balances of the mixture are obtained summing up the\ncomponent equations [42, 43]. This leads to relations between constitutive\nquantities for components and constitutive quantities for the mixture.\n\n5\n\nMesoscopic balance equations for the mixture\nand its components\n\nMesoscopic balance equations are defined on the mesoscopic space. For the\nmixture as a whole the additional mesoscopic variable is the material velocity\nv of the mixture, which is the weighted sum of the component velocities, see\nequation (4.6). The mesoscopic balance equations are derived analogously\nto the derivation discussed in the second section (see equation (2.6) for the\ngeneral structure of these balances) and by suitable identifications. The\nmesoscopic balance equations for the mixture are those derived previously\nfor one component systems (see Section 2). In all cases it is supposed that\n\n\f8\nthe constituents of the mixture have no internal angular momentum, i.e.,\nwe are not dealing with micropolar continua.\nFor the mixture we introduce the distribution function of the material\nvelocity:\n\u03c1\u0302(\u2022)\n(5.1)\nf (x, t, v) = f (\u2022) =\n\u03c1(x, t)\nExplicitly we have the following mesoscopic balances:\n\n5.1\n\nMesoscopic balance equations for the mixture\n\nMesoscopic balance of mass\n\u2202\n(\u03c1\u0302)(\u2022) + \u2207 * (\u03c1\u0302v)(\u2022) + \u2207v * (\u0175\u03c1\u0302)(\u2022) = 0\n\u2202t\n\n(5.2)\n\nhere (\u2022) is the abbreviation for (x, t, v), v and w are the mesoscopic velocity of the mixture and the change in time of the mesoscopic variable v,\nrespectively (w = v\u0307).\nAccording to the definition of the distribution function equation (5.1), we\nobtain from the mesoscopic mass balance (5.2) a differential equation for\nthe MDF f (\u2022):\n\u2202f (\u2022)\n+ \u2207 * (f (\u2022)v) + \u2207v (f (\u2022)w(\u2022)) +\n\u2202t\n\u0010\u2202\n\u0011\n+f (\u2022)\n+ v * \u2207 lg \u03c1(x, t) = 0\n\u2202t\n\n(5.3)\n\nMesoscopic balance of momentum\n\u2202\nT\n(\u03c1\u0302v) + \u2207 * (\u03c1\u0302v \u2297 v) + \u2207v * (\u03c1\u0302\u0175 \u2297 v) \u2212 \u2207 * t\u0302 \u2212 \u2207v * T\u0302T = \u03c1\u0302f\u0302 .\n\u2202t\nT\n\n(5.4)\n\nT\n\nwith t\u0302 = t\u0302 and T\u0302 = T\u0302 .

All\nfield quantities here depend on position, time and particle velocity.\nDue to definition (5.1) the macroscopic material velocity of the mixture,\nv(x, t), i.e., the mean velocity of the mixture, is expressed as follows:\n\u03c1(x, t)v(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\nR3\n\n\u03c1\u0302vdv,\n\n(5.5)\n\n\f9\nMesoscopic balance of energy\n\u2202\n1\n1\n[\u03c1\u0302(\u00ea + v * v)] + \u2207 * [q\u0302 \u2212 v * t\u0302 + \u03c1(\u00ea + v * v)v] +\n\u2202t\n2\n2\n1\n+\u2207v * [Q\u0302 \u2212 w * T\u0302 + \u03c1\u0302w(\u00ea + v * v)] =\n2\n= \u03c1\u0302(f\u0302 * v + r\u0302) + P\u0302e\n\n(5.6)\n\nQ is the analogue to the heat flux density in velocity space, i.e., a nonconvective energy flux over the boundary in the mesoscopic part of the\ndomain, which consists of position, time and velocity for all fields, here.\nBy integrating these mesoscopic balances over the mesoscopic space, i.e.,\nover all velocities, with the meosocopic distribution function as statistical\nweight, the macroscopic balance equations for the mixture are obtained.\n\n5.2\n\nMesoscopic balance equations for the components of the\nmixture\n\nMesoscopic balance of mass of component A\nBy using the general form of the mesoscopic balance of mass (see also [33,\n44, 41, 30]), we have the following equation for the component A:\n\u2202 A\nA\n(*)\n(\u03c1\u0302 )(*) + \u2207 * (\u03c1\u0302A vA )(*) + \u2207v * (wA \u03c1\u0302A )(*) = P\u0302chem\n\u2202t\n\n(5.7)\n\nhere vA represents the material velocity of component A, and wA is the\nchange in time of the mesoscopic variable vA : wA = v\u0307A .

These fields of order parameters describe macroscopically the mesoscopic state of the system introduced by vA and v and its distribution\nfunctions f A and f . Thus these are the link between the mesoscopic background description of the system and its extended description by additional\nmacroscopic fields. In a macroscopic phenomenological theory they represent in general internal variables which satisfy relaxation equations. In our\ncase the first moments a1 and aA\n1 are not internal variables, but classical\nwanted fields, namely the specific momentum densities (material velocities)\nv and vA . The higher order moments are internal variables in the sense of\nthermodynamics.\nThe diffusion fluxes JA , (A = 1, ..., N ) are proportional to the difference\nof the first moment of the distribution functions f A (*) and f (*).

Using further approximations it is possible to obtain a Cattaneo-type diffusion equation. In\norder to exploit equation (7.9) further, it is necessary to insert expressions\nfor w and wA . These are equations on the mesoscopic level, and they can\nbe interpreted as mesoscopic constitutive equations. In this case the domain of constitutive mappings, the state space has to be introduced. In\nmesoscopic theories there are different possibilities: one is to introduce a\nstate space of purely mesoscopic variables, another one is to introduce a\nmixed space including mesoscopic and macroscopic variables, and the third\n\n\f16\npossibility is one containing only macroscopic variables. The mesoscopic\nbackground of the constitutive theory has been applied to liquid crystals of\nuniaxial molecules [34, 41, 45, 46] and to dipolar media [47]. For diffusion\nin mixtures this is left for future work.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown a way to derive a differential equation for the diffusion flux\nfrom the so called mesoscopic theory. In this refined theory an additional\nvariable in the domain of the field quantities is introduced, here the velocity,\nand we have a velocity distribution. We have derived a differential equation\nfor the diffusion flux from the mesocopic balance equations. The differential\nequation for the diffusion flux is of balance type, i.e., of the form used in\nextended thermodynamics. Therefore, it can be expected that our approach\nleads to hyperbolic systems of field equations, but the investigation of this\nquestion is left for future work.\nBecause the level here is not the microscopic one, no assumptions about\ninter-particle interactions have to be made here in contrast to kinetic theory.\nWe are here on the continuum level, and many-particle interactions are taken\ninto account automatically. This is not the case for derivations of the field\nequations of extended thermodynamics based on the Boltzmann-equation.\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to W.
