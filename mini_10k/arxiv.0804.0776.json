Several years after the pioneering work by Fermi Pasta and Ulam,\nfundamental questions about the link between dynamical and statistical properties\nremain still open in modern statistical mechanics. Particularly controversial is the\nrole of deterministic chaos for the validity and consistency of statistical approaches.\nThis contribution reexamines such a debated issue taking inspiration from the problem of diffusion and heat conduction in deterministic systems. Is microscopic chaos\na necessary ingredient to observe such macroscopic phenomena?\n\n1.1 Introduction\nStatistical mechanics, founded by Maxwell, Boltzmann and Gibbs, aims to\nexplain the macroscopic properties of systems with a huge number of degrees\nof freedom without specific assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, a part\nfrom ergodicity [1, 2]. The discovery of deterministic chaos [3], beyond its\nundoubted important implications on many natural phenomena, enforced us\nto reconsider some basic problems standing at the foundations of statistical\nmechanics such as, for instance, the applicability of a statistical description\nto low dimensional systems. However, even after many years, the experts do\nnot agree yet on the basic conditions which should ensure the validity of\nstatistical mechanics.\nThe spectrum of viewpoints found in literature is rather wide, ranging\nfrom the Landau (and Khinchin [4]) earlier belief on the key role of the many\ndegrees of freedom and the (almost) complete irrelevance of ergodicity, to\nthe opinion of those who, as Prigogine and his school [5] considers chaos as\nthe crucial requirement to develop consistent statistical approaches. Recently\nsome authors (e.g. Lebowitz [6], Bricmont [7]) have given new life to the\ndebate [10, 5], renewing the intuition of Boltzmann [8] and Maxwell [9] on\nthe relevance of the huge number of particles in macroscopic systems.\nThis volume offers the opportunity to celebrate the 100th and 50th anniversaries of two of the most influential works in statistical physics: Einstein's\n\n\f2\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nwork on Brownian motion (1905) [11] and Fermi's one (1955) on the nonlinear chain of oscillators (al secolo the FPU work, from the authors E. Fermi,\nJ. Pasta and S. Ulam [12]). We shall discuss some aspects related to diffusion\nproblems and heat conduction focusing on the role of (microscopic) chaos for\nthe occurrence and robustness of these (macroscopic) phenomena. Transport\nphenomena, despite their ubiquity in everyday life, are still subject of debate\namong theoretic physicists.\nBecause of the variety of specific interactions and technical difficulties\nin realistic systems, simplified microscopic models are unavoidable tools for\nthe study of transport mechanism. Several simulations and theoretical works\nhave shown that, in systems with very strong chaos (namely hyperbolic systems), there exists a close relationship between transport coefficients (e.g.\nviscosity, diffusivity, thermal and electrical conductivity) and indicators of\nchaos (Lyapunov exponents, KS entropy, escape rates) [13, 14]. At a first\nglance, the existence of such relations would support the point of view of who\nconsiders chaos as the basic ingredient for the applicability of statistical mechanics. However, it is not possible to extend those results to generic systems.\nIn fact, we shall see that many counterexamples prove that chaos is not a\nnecessary condition for the emergence of robust statistical behaviors [15, 16].\nIn particular, we shall see that phenomena such as diffusion [17] and heat\nconduction [18] may take place also in non-chaotic systems. These and many\nother examples provide indication that microscopic chaos is not the unique\npossible origin of macroscopic transport in dynamical systems.\nThe material is organized into two, almost self-contained, parts. In the\nfirst, after a brief historical introduction to the different microscopic models\nproposed to explain macroscopic diffusion, we discuss a recent experiment\n(and the consequent debate it stimulated) aimed to prove that microscopic\nchaos is at the origin of Brownian motion. This gives us the possibility to\nintroduce and discuss the problem of diffusion in non-chaotic deterministic\nsystems, and to point point out the necessary microscopic conditions to observe diffusion. The second part is mostly devoted to a discussion of the\ncelebrated FPU numerical experiments and its consequences for the ergodic\nproblem and heat conduction. We shall see that there are non-chaotic models\ndisplaying (macroscopic) heat conduction, confirming the non-essential role\nof chaos on transport.\n\n1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the atomistic theory of matter was\nnot yet fully accepted by the scientific community. While searching for phenomena that would prove, beyond any doubt, the existence of atoms, Einstein\nrealized that \"... according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of\nmicroscopically-visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of\nsuch magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope ...\", as he\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n3\n\nwrote in his celebrated paper in 1905 [11]. In this work, devoted to compare\nthe different predictions that classical thermodynamics and molecular-kinetic\ntheory of heat make about those small bodies, Einstein argued that their motion has a diffusive character. Moreover, he discovered an important relation\namong the diffusion coefficient D, the fluid viscosity \u03b7, the particles radius a\n(having assumed spherical particles), Avogadro's number NA , the temperature T and the gas constant R:\nD=\n\n1 RT\n.\nNA 6\u03c0\u03b7a\n\n(1.1)\n\nEinstein relation (1.1), that may be seen as the first example of the fluctuationdissipation theorem [19], allowed for the determination of Avogadro's number [20] and gave one of the ultimate evidences of the existence of atoms.\nEinstein's work on Brownian motion (BM) is based on statistical mechanics and thermodynamical considerations applied to suspended particles, with\nthe assumption of velocity decorrelation.\nOne of the first successful attempts to develop a purely dynamical theory of BM dates back to Langevin [21] that, as himself wrote, gave \"... a\ndemonstration [of Einstein results] that is infinitely more simple by means of\na method that is entirely different.\" Langevin considered the Newton equation\nfor a small spherical particle in a fluid, taking into account that the Stokes\nviscous force it experiences is only a mean force. In one direction, say e.g. the\nx-direction, one has:\ndx\nd2 x\n+F\n(1.2)\nm 2 = \u22126\u03c0\u03b7a\ndt\ndt\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. The first term of the r.h.s. is the Stokes\nviscous force. The second one F (t) is a fluctuating random force, independent\nof v = dx/dt, modeling the effects of the huge number of impacts with the\nsurrounding fluid molecules, which is taken as a zero-mean, Gaussian process\nwith covariance hF (t)F (t\u2032 )i = c\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The constant c is determined by the\nequipartition condition h(dx/dt)2 i = RT /(mNA ), i.e. c = 12\u03c0\u03b7aRT /NA .\nLangevin's work along with that of Ornstein and Uhlenbeck [22] are at the\nfoundation of the theory of stochastic differential equations. The stochastic\napproach is however unsatisfactory being a phenomenological description.\nThe next theoretical challenge toward the building of a dynamical theory\nof Brownian motion is to understand its microscopic origin from first principles. Almost contemporaneously to Einstein's efforts, Smoluchowski tried to\nderive the large scale diffusion of Brownian particles from the similar physical\nassumptions about their collisions with the fluid molecules [23].\nA renewed interest on the subject appeared some years later, when it was\nrealized that even purely deterministic systems composed of a large number of\nparticles give rise to macroscopic diffusion, at least on finite time scales. These\nmodels had an important impact in justifying Brownian motion theory and,\nmore in general, in deriving a consistent microscopic theory of irreversibility.\n\n\f4\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nSome of these works considered chains of harmonic oscillators of equal\nmasses [24, 25, 26, 27], while others [28, 29] analyzed the motion of a heavy\nimpurity linearly coupled to a chain of equal mass oscillators. When the\nnumber of oscillators goes to infinity, the momentum of the heavy particle was\nproved to behave as a genuine stochastic process described by the Langevin\nequation (1.2). When their number is finite, diffusion remains an effective\nphenomenon lasting for a (long but) finite time.\nSoon after the discovery of dynamical chaos [30], it was realized that also\nsimple low dimensional deterministic systems may exhibit a diffusive behavior. In this framework, the two-dimensional Lorentz gas [31], describing the\nmotion of a free particle through a lattice of hard round obstacles, provided\nthe most valuable example. As a consequence of the obstacle convexity, particle trajectories are chaotic, i.e., aside from a set initial conditions of zero\nmeasure, exhibit a positive and finite Lyapunov exponent,. At long times, for\nthe case of billiards, the mean squared displacement from the particle initial\nposition grows linearly in time. A Lorentz system with periodically arranged\nscatterers is closely related to the Sinai billiard [32, 33], which can be obtained from the former by folding the trajectories into the unitary lattice\ncell. The extensive study on billiards has shown that chaotic behavior might\nusually be associated with diffusion in simple low dimensional models, supporting the idea that chaos was at the very origin of diffusion. However, more\nrecently (see e.g. Ref. [17]) it has been shown that even non-chaotic deterministic systems, such as a bouncing particle in a two-dimensional billiard with\npolygonal but randomly distributed obstacles (wind-tree Ehrenfest model),\nmay exhibit a diffusion-like properties. This example can lead to think that\nthe external source of randomness may play a role similar to chaos (for a\nmore detailed discussion about this point see Sect. 1.2.2).\nDeterministic diffusion is a generic phenomenon present also in simple\nchaotic maps on the line. Among the many contributions we mention the\nwork by Fujisaka, Grossmann [34, 35] and Geisel [36, 37]. A typical example\nis the one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system:\nx(t + 1) = [x(t)] + F (x(t) \u2212 [x(t)]) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere x(t) (the position of a point-like particle) performs diffusion in the real\naxis. The bracket [. . .] denotes the integer part of the argument. F (u) is a\nmap defined on the interval [0, 1] that fulfills the following requirements:\ni) The map, u(t + 1) = F (u(t)) (mod 1) is chaotic.\nii) F (u) must be larger than 1 and smaller than 0 for some values of u,\nso to have a non vanishing probability to escape from each unit cell (a unit\ncell of real axis is every interval Cl \u2261 [l, l + 1], with l \u2208 Z).\niii) Fr (u) = 1 \u2212 Fl (1 \u2212 u), where Fl and Fr define the map in u \u2208 [0, 1/2[\nand u \u2208 [1/2, 1] respectively. This anti-symmetry condition with respect to\nu = 1/2 is introduced to avoid a net drift.\nA very simple and much studied example of F is\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\nF (u) =\n\n\u001a\n\n2(1 + a)u\n2(1 + a)(u \u2212 1) + 1\n\nif u \u2208 [0, 1/2[\nif u \u2208 [1/2, 1]\n\n5\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere a > 0 is the control parameter. It is useful to remind the link between\ndiffusion and velocity correlation, i.e. the Taylor-Kubo formula, that helps to\nunravel how diffusion can be realized in different ways. The velocity correlation function is defined as C(\u03c4 ) = hv(\u03c4 )v(0)i, where v(t) is the velocity of\nthe particle at time t. It is easy to see that for continuous time systems (e.g.\nEq.(1.2))\nZ t\n2\nh[x(t) \u2212 x(0)] i \u2243 2 t\nd\u03c4 C(\u03c4 ) .\n(1.5)\n0\n\nR\u221e\n\nStandard diffusion, with D = 0 d\u03c4 C(\u03c4 ), is always obtained whenever the\nhypotheses for the validity of the central limit theorem are verified:\ni) finite variance of the velocity: hv 2 i < \u221e;\nii) faster than \u03c4 \u22121 decay of the velocity correlation function C(\u03c4 )1 .\nThe first condition, independently of the microscopic dynamics under consideration (stochastic, deterministic chaotic or regular), excludes unphysical\nmodels, i.e. with infinite variance for the velocity. The second requirement\ncorresponds to a rapid memory loss of initial conditions. It is surely verified\nfor the Langevin dynamics where the presence of the stochastic force entails\na rapid decay of C(\u03c4 ). In deterministic regular systems, such as the model\nof many oscillators, the velocity decorrelation (i.e., the small fluctuations of\nC(\u03c4 ) around zero, for almost all the time) is the result of the huge number of\ndegrees of freedom that act as a heat bath on a single oscillator. In the (nonchaotic) Ehrenfest wind-tree model decorrelation originates from the disorder\nin the obstacle positions. Deterministic chaotic systems, in spite of the fact\nthat nonlinear instabilities generically lead to a memory loss, are more subtle.\nIndeed, there are many examples, namely intermittent systems [38], characterized by a slow decay of the velocity correlation function.\nWe end this section by asking whether it is possible to determine, by the\nanalysis of a Brownian particle, if the microscopic dynamics underlying the\nobserved macroscopic diffusion is stochastic, deterministic chaotic or regular.\n1.2.1 Chaos or Noise? A difficult dilemma\nInferring the microscopic deterministic character of Brownian motion on an\nexperimental basis would be attractive from a fundamental viewpoint. Moreover it could provide further evidence to some recent theoretical and numerical studies [39, 40]. Before discussing a recent experiment[41] in this direction, we must open the \"Pandora box\" of the longstanding and controversial\nproblem of distinguishing chaos from noise in signal analysis [42] (see also\nR\n1\nIn discrete-time systems, the velocity v(t) and the integral d\u03c4 C(\u03c4 ) P\nare replaced\n2\nby the finite difference x(t+1)\u2212x(t) and by the quantity hv(0) i/2+\nrespectively.\n\n\u03c4 \u22651\n\nC(\u03c4 ),\n\n\f6\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nRefs. [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]). For the sake of clearness on the terminology\nused here, we specify that: \"chaos\" refers to the motions originating from a\ndeterministic system with at least one positive but finite Lyapunov exponent\nand therefore a positive and finite Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy; \"noise\" instead\ndenotes the outcomes of a continuous valued stochastic process with infinite\nvalue of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.\nThe first observation concerning the chaos/noise distinction is that, very\noften in the analysis of experimental time series, there is not a unique model\nof the \"system\" that produced the data. Moreover, even the knowledge of the\n\"true\" model might not be an adequate answer about the character of the\nsignal. From this point of view, BM is a paradigmatic example: in fact it can\nbe modeled by a stochastic as well as by a deterministic chaotic or regular\nprocess.\nIn principle a definite answer exists. If we were able to determine the\nmaximum Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb) or the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (hKS ) of\na data sequence, we would know without uncertainty whether the sequence\nwas generated by a deterministic law (\u03bb, hKS < \u221e) or by a stochastic one\n(hKS \u2192 \u221e). Nevertheless, there are unavoidable practical limitations in\ncomputing such quantities. They are indeed defined as infinite time averages\ntaken in the limit of arbitrary fine resolution. But, in experiments, we have\naccess only to a finite, and often very limited, range of scales and times.\nHowever, there are measurable quantities that are appropriate for extracting meaningful information from the signal. In particular, we shall consider the (\u01eb, \u03c4 )-entropy per unit time [51, 52, 53] h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) that generalizes the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy (for details see next section Cfr. Eq. (1.8)). In a\nnutshell, while for evaluating hKS one has to detect the properties of a system\nwith infinite resolution, for h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) a finite scale (resolution) \u01eb is involved. The\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy is recovered in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, i.e. h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u2192 hKS .\nThis means that if we had access to arbitrarily small scales, we could answer the original question about the character of the law that generated the\nrecorded signal. Even if this limit is unattainable, still the behavior of h(\u01eb, \u03c4 )\nprovides a very useful scale-dependent description of the signal character\n[42, 54].\nFor instance, chaotic systems (0 < hKS < \u221e) are typically characterized\nby h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) attaining a plateau \u2248 hKS , below a resolution threshold, \u01ebc , associated with the smallest characteristic length scale of the system. Instead,\nfor \u01eb > \u01ebc h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) < hKS , and in this range the details of the \u01eb-dependence\nmay be informative on the large scale (slow) dynamics of the system (see e.g.\nRefs. [42, 54]). Indeed, at large scales typically chaotic systems give rise to behaviors rather similar to stochastic processes (e.g. the diffusive behavior discussed in the previous subsection) with characteristic \u01eb-entropy. In stochastic\nsignals, although hKS = \u221e, for any \u01eb > 0, h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) is a finite function of \u01eb and\n\u03c4 . The dependence of h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) on \u01eb and \u03c4 , when known, provides a characterization of the underlying stochastic process (see Refs. [51, 53]). For instance,\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n7\n\nstationary Gaussian processes with a power spectrum2 S(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u2212(2\u03b1+1) (being 0 < \u03b1 < 1) are characterized by a power-law \u01eb-entropy [51]:\nlim h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u223c \u01eb\u22121/\u03b1 .\n\n\u03c4 \u21920\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe case \u03b1 = 1/2, corresponding to the power spectrum of a Brownian\nsignal, would give h(\u01eb) \u223c \u01eb\u22122 . Other stochastic processes, such as e.g. time\nuncorrelated and bounded ones, are characterized by a logarithmic divergence\nbelow a critical scale, \u01ebc , which may depend on \u03c4 .\nDefinition and computation of the \u01eb-entropy\nFor the sake of self-consistency in this subsection we provide some basic information on the definition and measurement (from experimental data) of the\n\u01eb-entropy, which was originally introduced in the context of information theory by Shannon [52] and, later, by Kolmogorov [51] in the theory of stochastic\nprocesses. The interested reader may find more details in [53] and [55].\nAn operative definition of h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) is as follows. Given the time evolution of\na continuous variable x(t) \u2208 Rd , that represents the state of a d-dimensional\nsystem, one introduces the vector in Rmd\nX(m) (t) = (x(t), . . . , x(t + m\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 )) ,\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhich represents a portion of the trajectory, sampled at a discrete time interval \u03c4 . After partitioning the phase space Rd using hyper-cubic cells of side \u01eb,\nX(m) (t) is coded into a m-word: W m (\u01eb, t) = [i(\u01eb, t), . . . , i(\u01eb, t+m\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 )], where\ni(\u01eb, t+j\u03c4 ) labels the cell in Rd containing x(t+j\u03c4 ). For bounded motions, the\nnumber of available cells (i.e. the alphabet) is finite. Under the hypothesis\nof stationarity, the probabilities P (W m (\u01eb)) of the admissible words {W m (\u01eb)}\nare obtained from the time evolution\nof X(m) (t). Then one introduces the\nP\nm-block entropy, Hm (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) = \u2212 {W m (\u01eb)} P (W m (\u01eb)) ln P (W m (\u01eb)), and the\nquantity hm (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) = [Hm+1 (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u2212 Hm (\u01eb, \u03c4 )]/\u03c4 . The (\u01eb, \u03c4 )-entropy per unit\ntime, h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) is defined by [52]:\nh(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) = lim hm (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) .\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is obtained in the limit of small \u01eb\nhKS = lim h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) .\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n(1.9)\n\nIn principle, in deterministic systems h(\u01eb), and henceforth hKS , does depend\nneither on the sampling time \u03c4 [3], nor on the chosen partition because its\nrigorous definition[53] would require the infimum to be taken over all possible partitions with elements of size smaller than \u01eb. However, in practical\n2\n\nThe power spectrum S(\u03c9) is the Fourier transform of h[x(t) \u2212 x(0)]2 i\n\n\f8\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\ncomputations, the specific value of \u03c4 is important, and the impossibility to\ntake the infimum over all the partitions implies that, at finite \u01eb, h(\u01eb) may\ndepend on the chosen partition. Nevertheless, for small \u01eb, the correct value\nof the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is usually recovered independently of the\npartition [3].\nLet us stress that partitioning the phase space does not mean a discretization of the states of the dynamical system, which still evolves on a continuum. The partitioning procedure corresponds to a coarse-grained description\n(due, for instance, to measurements performed with a finite resolution), that\ndoes not change the dynamics. On the contrary, discretizing the states would\nchange the dynamics, implying periodic motions in any deterministic systems. This happens, for instance, in any floating point computer simulations;\nhowever such periods are, apart from trivial cases, very long and practically\nundetectable.\nIn experimental signals, usually, only a scalar variable u(t) can be measured and moreover the dimensionality of the phase space is not known a\npriori. In these cases one uses delay embedding techniques [45, 46], where\nthe vector X(m) (t) is build as (u(t), u(t + \u03c4 ), . . . , u(t + m\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 )), now in Rm .\nThis is a special instance of (1.7). Then to determine the entropies Hm (\u01eb),\nvery efficient numerical methods are available (the reader may find an exhaustive review in Ref. [45]). The delay embedding procedure can be applied\nto compute the \u01eb-entropy of deterministic and stochastic signals as well. The\ndependence of the \u01eb-entropy on the observation scale \u01eb can be used to characterize the process underlying the signal [53].\nIn the following we exemplify the typical difficulties by analyzing the map\nx(t + 1) = f (x(t)) = x(t) + p sin(2\u03c0x(t)) .\n\n(1.10)\n\nAs soon as p > 0.7326 . . ., f (x) is such that f (x) > 1 and f (x) < 0 for some\nx \u2208]0, 1[. This implies that the trajectory can travel across different unitary\ncells giving rise to large scale diffusion, i.e. asymptotically:\nh[x(t) \u2212 x(0)]2 i \u2243 2Dt ,\n\n(1.11)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient. We note that p = O(1) sets the intrinsic\nscale of the displacements to be O(1). Therefore, as far as the \u01eb-entropy is\nconcerned, for \u01eb \u226a 1 (small scale observations) one should be able to recognize\nthat the system is chaotic, i.e. h(\u01eb) displays a plateau at hKS = \u03bb. For \u01eb \u226b 1\n(large scale observations), due to the diffusive behavior, h(\u01eb) is characterized\nby the scaling (1.6) with \u03b1 = 1/2, therefore\n\u001a\n\u03bb\nfor \u01eb \u226a 1\nh(\u01eb) \u2243\n,\n(1.12)\nD/\u01eb2 for \u01eb \u226b 1\nwhere \u03bb is the Lyapunov exponent and D is the diffusion coefficient. The typical problems encountered in numerically computing h(\u01eb) can be appreciated\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n9\n\n100\n\nh(\u03b5,\u03c4)\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n\u03b5\n\nFig. 1.1.

The boxes refer to the entropy\ncomputed with \u03c4 = 1 but by using periodic boundary condition over 40 cells. The\nuse of periodic boundary conditions is necessary to probe scales small enough to\nrecover the Lyapunov exponent. The straight lines correspond to the two asymptotic\nbehaviors, h(\u01eb) = hKS \u2243 1.15 and h(\u01eb) \u223c \u01eb\u22122 .\n\nin Fig. 1.1. First notice that the deterministic character (i.e. h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u2248 hKS )\nappears only at \u01eb < \u01ebc \u2248 1. However, the finiteness of the data set imposes\na lower cut-off scale \u01ebd below which no information can be extracted from\nthe data (see Ref. [56]). As for the importance of the choice of \u03c4 note that\nif \u03c4 is much larger or much shorter than the characteristic time-scale of the\nsystem at the scale \u01eb, then the correct behavior of the \u01eb-entropy [42] cannot\nbe properly recovered. Indeed the diffusive behavior h(\u01eb) \u223c \u01eb\u22122 is roughly\nobtained only by considering the envelope of hm (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) evaluated at different\nvalues of \u03c4 . The reason for this is that the characteristic time of the system\nis determined by its diffusive behavior T\u01eb \u2248 \u01eb2 /D. On the other hand, the\nplateau at the value hKS can be recovered only for \u03c4 \u2248 1, even if, in principle,\nany value of \u03c4 could be used.\nWe also mention that if the system is deterministic, to have a meaningful\nmeasure of the entropy, the embedding dimension m has to be larger than\ninformation dimension of the attractor [3].\n\n\f10\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nExperiments on the microscopic origin of Brownian Motion\nWe are now ready to discuss the experiment and its analysis reported in\nRef. [41]. In this experiment, a long time record (about 1.5 \u00d7 105 data points)\nof the motion of a small colloidal particle in water was sampled at regular time\nintervals (\u2206t = 1/60 s) with a remarkable high spatial resolution (25 nm).\nTo our knowledge, this is the most accurate measurement of a BM. The data\nwere then processed by means of standard methods of nonlinear time-series\nanalysis [45] to compute the \u01eb-entropy3. This computation shows a power-law\ndependence h(\u01eb) \u223c \u01eb\u22122 . Actually, similarly to what displayed in Fig. 1.1, this\nbehavior is recovered only by considering the envelope of the h(\u01eb, \u03c4 )-curves,\nfor different \u03c4 's. However, unlike to Fig. 1.1, no saturation h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u2248 const\nis observed for small \u01eb. Nevertheless, the authors assume from the outset\nthat the system dynamics\nis deterministic and, since in deterministic systems\nP+\nh(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) \u2264 hKS \u2264 i \u03bbi , deduce from the positivity of h(\u01eb) the existence of\npositive Lyapunov exponents. Their conclusion is thus that microscopic chaos\nis at the origin of the macroscopic diffusive behavior.\nHowever, as several works pointed out (see Refs. [57, 58]), the huge amount\nof involved degrees of freedom (Brownian particle and the fluid molecules),\nthe impossibility to reach a (spatial and temporal) resolution high enough,\nand the limited amount of data points do not allow for such optimistic conclusions. Avoiding a technical discussion on these three points we simply notice\nthat the limitation induced by the finite resolution is particularly relevant to\nthe experiment. For example, if the analysis of Fig. 1.1 would be restricted to\nthe region with \u01eb > 1 only, then discerning whether the data were originated\nby a chaotic system or by a stochastic process would be impossible.\nParticularly interesting is the fact that, as shown by Dettmann et al. [57,\n17], the finite amount of data severely limits our ability to distinguish not only\nif the signal is deterministic, chaotic or stochastic but also if it is deterministic\nregular, i.e. of zero entropy. The following example serves as a clue to better\nunderstand the way in which a deterministic non-chaotic systems may give\nrise (at least on certain temporal and spatial scales) to a stochastic behavior.\nLet us consider two signals, the first generated by a continuous random\nwalk:\n\u221a\n(1.13)\n\u1e8b(t) = 2D\u03b7(t) ,\nwhere \u03b7 is a zero mean Gaussian variable with h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), and the\nsecond obtained as a superpositions of Fourier modes:\n3\n\nOf course in data analysis, only scalar time series are available and the dimensionality of the space of state vectors is a priori unknown. However, one can\nuse the delay embedding technique to reconstruct the phase-space. In this way,\nthe \u01eb-entropy can be evaluated as discussed in the previous section. It is worth\nstressing that this procedure can be applied even though the equations of motion of the system, which generated the signal, are unknown. Moreover, this\napproach is meaningful independently of the stochastic or deterministic nature\nof the considered signal.\n\n\fx(t)\n\n1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n11\n\n(a)\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nt\nFig. 1.2.

We know [29]\nthat x(t) performs a genuine BM in the limit M \u2192 \u221e. For M < \u221e the\nmotion is quasi-periodic and regular, nevertheless for large but finite times it\nis impossible to distinguish signals obtained by (1.13) and (1.14) (see Fig. 1.2).\nThis is even more striking looking at the computed \u01eb-entropy of both signals\n(see Fig. 1.3).\nThe results of Fig. 1.3 along with those by Dettman et al. [57] suggest\nthat, by assuming also the deterministic character of the system, we are in\nthe practical impossibility of discerning chaotic from regular motion.\nIt is worth mentioning that recently some interesting works [43, 44] applied the entropy analysis to the motion of a heavy impurity embedded in an\nFPU-chain (see Sect. 1.3.1), which is a chaotic variant of the above example.\nThe purpose was again to infer the chaotic character of the whole FPU-chain\nby observations on the the impurity motion only. It was found that the impurity does not alter the behavior of the FPU-chain so it can be considered as a\ntrue probe of the dynamics.

In this case, in\nfact, it is possible to give an unambiguous classification of the signal character\nbased solely on the entropy analysis and free from any prior knowledge of the\nsystem/model that generated the data. Moreover the behavior of h(\u01eb, \u03c4 ) as a\nfunction of (\u01eb, \u03c4 ) provides a very useful \"dynamical\" classification of stochastic processes [53, 59]. One has then a practical tool to classify the character of\na signal as deterministic or stochastic, on a given scale, without referring to\na specific model, and is no longer obliged to answer the metaphysical question, whether the system that produced the data was a deterministic or a\nstochastic [60, 42] one.\n1.2.2 Diffusion in deterministic non-chaotic systems\nWith all the proviso on its interpretation, Gaspard's and coworkers' [41] experiment had a very positive role not only in stimulating the discussion about\nthe chaos/noise distinction but also in focusing the attention on deep conceptual aspects of diffusion. From a theoretical point of view, the study of chaotic\nmodels exhibiting diffusion and their non-chaotic counterpart is indeed important to better understand the role of microscopic chaos on macroscopic\ndiffusion.\nIn Lorentz gases, the diffusion coefficient is related, by means of periodic\norbits expansion methods [13, 14, 61], to chaotic indicators such as the Lyapunov exponents. This suggested that chaos was or might have been the basic\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n13\n\ningredient for diffusion. However, as argued by Dettmann and Cohen [17],\neven an accurate numerical analysis based on the \u01eb-entropy, being limited by\nthe finiteness of the data points, has no chance to detect differences in the\ndiffusive behavior between a chaotic Lorentz gas and its non-chaotic counterpart, such as the wind-tree Ehrenfest's model. In the latter model, particles\n(wind) scatter against square obstacles (trees) randomly distributed in the\nplane but with fixed orientation. Since the reflection by the flat edges of the\nobstacles cannot produce exponential separation of trajectories, the maximal\nLyapunov exponent is zero. The result of Ref. [17] implies thus that chaos\nmay be not indispensable for having deterministic diffusion. The question\nmay be now posed on what are the necessary microscopic ingredients to observe deterministic diffusion at large scales.\nWe would like to remark that, in the wind-tree Ehrenfest's model, the external randomness amounting to the disordered distribution of the obstacles\nis crucial. Hence, one may conjecture that a finite spatial entropy density hS\nis necessary for observing diffusion. In this case deterministic diffusion might\nbe a consequence either of a non-zero \"dynamical\" entropy (hKS > 0) in\nchaotic systems or of a non-zero \"static\" entropy (hS > 0) in non-chaotic\nsystems. This is a key-point, because someone can argue that a deterministic\ninfinite system with spatial randomness can be interpreted as an effective\nstochastic system4 .\nWith the aim of clarifying this point, we consider here a spatially disordered non-chaotic model [62], which is the one-dimensional analog of a\ntwo-dimensional non-chaotic Lorentz system with polygonal obstacles. Let\nus start with the map defined by Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4), and introduce\nsome modifications to make it non-chaotic. One can proceed as exemplified in Fig. 1.4, that is by replacing the function (1.4) on each unit cell\nby its step-wise approximation generated as follows. The first-half of Cl\nis partitioned in N micro-intervals [l + \u03ben\u22121 , l + \u03ben [ , n = 1, . . . , N , with\n\u03be0 = 0 < \u03be1 < \u03be2 < . . . < \u03beN \u22121 < \u03beN = 1/2. In each interval the map is\ndefined by its linear approximation\nF\u2206 (u) = u \u2212 \u03ben + F (\u03ben )\n\nif u \u2208 [\u03ben\u22121 , \u03ben [ ,\n\n(1.15)\n\nwhere F (\u03ben ) is (1.4) evaluated at \u03ben . The map in the second half of the unit\ncell is then determined by the anti-symmetry condition with respect to the\n\u22121\nmiddle of the cell. The quenched random variables {\u03bek }N\nk=1 are uniformly\ndistributed in the interval [0, 1/2], i.e. the micro-intervals have a random extension. Further they are chosen independently in each cell Cl (so one should\n(l)\nproperly write \u03ben ). All cells are partitioned into the same number N of randomly chosen micro-intervals (of mean size \u2206 = 1/N ). This modification of\nthe continuous chaotic system is conceptually equivalent to replacing circular\nby polygonal obstacles in the Lorentz system [17].\n4\n\nThis is probably a \"matter of taste\"\n\n\f14\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\n1.0\n\nF(u)\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nu\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFig. 1.4. Sketch of the random staircase map in the unitary cell. The parameter\na defining the macroscopic slope is set to 0.23. Half domain [0, 1/2] is divided into\nN = 12 micro-intervals of random size. The map on [1/2, 1] is obtained by applying\nthe antisymmetric transformation with respect to the center of the cell (1/2, 1/2).\n\nSince F\u2206 has slope 1 almost everywhere, the map is no longer chaotic, violating the condition i) (see Sect. 1.2). For \u2206 \u2192 0 (i.e. N \u2192 \u221e) the continuous\nchaotic map (1.3) is recovered. However, this limit is singular and as soon as\nthe number of intervals is finite, even if extremely large, chaos is absent. It\nhas been found [62] that this model still exhibits diffusion in the presence of\nboth quenched disorder and a quasi-periodic external perturbation\nx(t + 1) = [x(t)] + F\u2206 (x(t) \u2212 [x(t)]) + \u03b3 cos(\u03b1t) .\n\n(1.16)\n\nThe strength of the external forcing is controlled by \u03b3 and \u03b1 defines its\nfrequency, while \u2206 indicates a specific quenched disorder realization. The\nsign of \u03b3 is irrelevant; without lack of generality we study the case \u03b3 > 0.\nThe diffusion coefficient D is then numerically computed from the linear\nasymptotic behavior of the mean quadratic displacement, see Eq. (1.11). The\nresults, summarized in Fig. 1.5, show that D is significantly different from\nzero only for values \u03b3 > \u03b3c . For \u03b3 > \u03b3c , D exhibits a saturation close to the\nvalue of the chaotic system (horizontal line) defined by Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4).\nThe existence of a threshold \u03b3c is not surprising. Due to the staircase nature\nof the system, the perturbation has to exceed the typical discontinuity of\nF\u2206 to activate the \"macroscopic\" instability which is the first step toward\nthe diffusion. Data collapsing, obtained by plotting D versus \u03b3N , in Fig. 1.5\nconfirms this argument. These findings are robust and do not depend on the\ndetails of forcing. Therefore, we have an example of a non-chaotic model in\nthe Lyapunov sense by construction, which performs diffusion.\n\n\f1.2 On the microscopic origin of macroscopic diffusion\n\n15\n\nFig. 1.5. Log-Log plot of the dependence of the diffusion coefficient D on the external forcing strength \u03b3. Different data relative to a number of cell micro-intervals\nN = 50, 100 and 150 are plotted vs the natural scaling variable \u03b3N to obtain a collapse of the curves. Horizontal line represents the result for chaotic system (1.3,1.4).\n\nNow the question concerns the possibility that the diffusive behavior arises\nfrom the presence of a quenched randomness with non zero spatial entropy\nper unit length. To clarify this point, similarly to Ref. [17], the model can be\nmodified in such a way that the spatial entropy per unit cell is forced to be\nzero, and see if the diffusion still persists.\nZero spatial entropy per unit length may be obtained by repeating the\n(l)\n(l+M)\nsame disorder configuration every M cells (i.e. \u03ben = \u03ben\n). Looking at\nthe diffusion of an ensemble of walkers it was observed that diffusion is still\npresent with D very close to the expected value (as in Fig. 1.5). A careful\nanalysis (see Ref. [62] for details) showed that the system displays genuine\ndiffusion for a very long times even with a vanishing (spatial) entropy density,\nat least for sufficiently large M .\nThese results along with those by Dettmann and Cohen [17] allow us to\ndraw some conclusions on the fundamental ingredients for observing deterministic diffusion (both in chaotic and non-chaotic systems).\n\u2013\n\nAn instability mechanism is necessary to ensure particle dispersion at\nsmall scales (here small means inside the cells).

In systems with \"strong chaos\", all periodic orbits are unstable and, so, it is automatically fulfilled. In non-chaotic systems, such as the\nnon-chaotic billiards studied by Dettmann and Cohen and the map (1.16),\nthe stable periodic orbits seem to be suppressed or, at least, strongly depressed, by the quenched randomness (also in the limit of zero spatial entropy). However, unlike the two-dimensional non-chaotic billiards, in the 1-d\nsystem (1.4,1.15,1.16), the periodic orbits may survive to the presence of disorder, so we need the aid of a quasi-periodic perturbation to obtain their\ndestruction and the consequent diffusion.\n\n1.3 The heritage of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem for\nthe statistical mechanics\nThe ergodic theory begun with Boltzmann's effort to justify the determination of average values in kinetic theory. Ergodic hypothesis states that\ntime averages of observables of an isolated system at the equilibrium can\nbe computed as phase averages over the constant-energy hyper-surface. This\nstatement can be regarded as the first attempt to establish a link between\nstatistical mechanics and the dynamics of the underlying system. One can\nsay that proving the validity of ergodic hypothesis provides a \"dynamical\njustification\" of statistical ensembles.\nThe ergodic problem, at an abstract level, had been attacked by Birkhoff\nand von Neumann who proved their fundamental theorems on the existence\nof time averages and established a necessary and sufficient condition for the\nergodicity. In spite of their mathematical importance, on a practical ground\nsuch theorems do not help very much to really solve the ergodic problem in\nstatistical physics.\nThere exists a point of view according to which the effectiveness of a\nstatistical mechanics approach resides mainly on the presence of many degrees of freedom rather than on the underlying (chaotic or regular) dynamics.\nKhinchin in his celebrated book Mathematical Foundation of the Statistical\nMechanics [4] presents some important results on the ergodic problem that\nneed no metrical transitivity. The main point of his approach relies on the\nconcept of relevant physical observables in systems with a huge number of\ndegrees of freedom. Since physical observables are non-generic functions (in\n\n\f1.3 The heritage of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem for the statistical mechanics\n\nmathematical sense), the equivalence between time and ensemble averages\nshould be proved only for a restricted class of relevant observables. Moreover\nfor physical purposes, it is \"fair\" to accept the failure of ergodicity for few\n(in the sense of sets of small measure) initial conditions.\nIn plain words, Khinchin's formulation, coinciding with Boltzmann's point\nof view (see, e.g., Ch.1 of Ref.[2]), asserts that statistical mechanics works,\nindependently of ergodicity, because the (most meaningful) physical observables are practically constant, a part in regions of very small measure, on the\nconstant energy surface. Within this approach, dynamics have a marginal\nrole, and the existence of \"good statistical properties\" is granted by the large\nnumber of degrees of freedom. However, the validity of Khinchin's statement\nrestricts to a special class of observables not covering all the physically interesting possibilities. Therefore for each case, a detailed study of the specific\ndynamics is generally needed to assess the statistical properties of a given\nsystem.\nThe issue of ergodicity is naturally entangled with the problem of the\nexistence of non-trivial conserved quantities (first integrals) in Hamiltonian\nsystems. Consider a system governed by the Hamiltonian\nH(I, \u03c6) = H0 (I) + \u01ebH1 (I, \u03c6) ,\n\n(1.17)\n\nwhere I = (I1 , ..., IM ) are the action variables and \u03c6 = (\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6M ) are the\nphase variables. If \u01eb = 0 the system is integrable, there are M independent\nfirst integrals (the actions Ii ) and the motion evolves on M -dimensional tori.\nTwo questions arise naturally. Do the trajectories of the system (1.17) remain\n\"close\" to those of the integrable one? Do some conserved quantity, besides\nenergy, survive in the presence of a generic (small) perturbation \u01ebH1 (I, \u03c6)?\nOf course whenever other first integrals exist the system can not be ergodic.\nIn a seminal work, H. Poincar\u00e9 [64] showed that, generally, a system like\n(1.17) with \u01eb 6= 0 does not possess analytic first integrals other than energy.\nThis result sounds rather positive for the statistical mechanics approach.\nIn 1923 Fermi [65], generalizing Poincar\u00e9's result, proved that, for generic\nperturbations H1 and M > 2, there can not exist, on the 2M \u2212 1 dimensional\nconstant-energy surface, even a single smooth5 surface of dimension 2M \u2212 2\nthat is analytical in the variables (I, \u03c6) and \u01eb. From this result, Fermi argued\nthat generic (non-integrable) Hamiltonian systems are ergodic.\nAt least in the physicists' community, this conclusion was generally accepted and, even in the absence of a rigorous demonstration, there was a vast\nconsensus that the non-existence theorems of regular first integrals implied\nergodicity.\n1.3.1 FPU: relaxation to equilibrium and ergodicity violation\nThirty two years later Fermi itself, together with Pasta and Ulam, with one\nof the first numerical experiments, in the celebrated paper Studies of non5\n\nFor instance, analytic or differentiable enough\n\n17\n\n\f18\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nFig. 1.6.

Benettin [66])\n\nlinear problems [12] (often referred with the acronym FPU) showed that the\nergodic problem was still far from being solved. The FPU model studies the\ntime evolution of a chain of N particles, interacting by means of non-linear\nsprings:\nH=\n\nN \u0014 2\nX\np\n\n\u0015\nK\n\u01eb\n2\n\u03b1\n+ (qn+1 \u2212 qn ) + (qn+1 \u2212 qn ) ,\n2m\n2\n\u03b1\nn\n\nn=0\n\n(1.18)\n\nwith boundary conditions q0 = qN +1 = p0 = pN +1 = 0, \u03b1 = 3 or 4 and\nK > 0. The Hamiltonian is of the form (1.17) with a harmonic (integrable)\npart and a non-integrable (anharmonic) term O(\u01eb). For \u01eb = 0 one has a collection of N non-interacting harmonic modes of energies Ek 's, which remain\nconstant. What happens if an initial condition is chosen in such a way that\nall the energy is concentrated in a few normal modes, for instance E1 (0) 6= 0\nand Ek (0) = 0 for k = 2, . . . , N ? Before the FPU work, the general expectation would have been that the first normal mode would have progressively\ntransferred energy to the others and that, after some relaxation time, every\nEk (t) would fluctuate around the common value. Therefore, it came as a surprise the fact that no tendency toward equipartition was observed, even for\nlong times. In other words, a violation of ergodicity and mixing was found.\nFig. 1.6 shows the time evolution of the fraction of energy contained in three\nmodes (k = 1, 2, 3), in a system with N = 32. At the beginning all the energy\nis contained in mode 1. Instead of a distribution of the energy among all the\navailable modes, with a loss of memory of the initial state, the system exhibits a close to periodic behavior. The absence of equipartition can be well\nappreciated looking at Fig. 1.7, where the quantities\n\n\f1.3 The heritage of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem for the statistical mechanics\n\nFig. 1.7.

As one can see, almost all of the energy remains confined in the\nfirst four modes.\nThe existence of non ergodic behavior in non-integrable Hamiltonian systems is actually a consequence of the so-called KAM theorem [67, 68, 69],\nwhose first formulation, due to A. N. Kolmogorov, dates back to the year before the FPU paper. This was surely unbeknown to Fermi and his colleagues.\nThe FPU result can be seen (a posteriori) as a numerical \"verification\" of the\nKAM theorem and, above all, of its physical relevance, i.e. the tori survival\nfor physically significant values of the nonlinearity. After Kolmogorov and\nFPU, it is now well established that ergodicity is a non generic property of\nmechanical systems.\nConcerning the FPU problem, in terms of the KAM theorem, the following\nscenario, at least for large but finite times, can be outlined [70, 71, 72]. For\nN particles and for a given energy density E = E/N there is a threshold \u01ebc\nfor the strength of the perturbation such that\na) if \u01eb < \u01ebc the KAM tori are dominant and the system is essentially regular;\nb) if \u01eb > \u01ebc the KAM tori are negligible and the system is essentially chaotic.\nHowever, the long time evolution of very large chains with small \u01eb is hindered by the presence of metastable states. Probing such an asymptotics by\nnumerical simulations is extremely hard, for a discussion on the subject see\nthe contributions by Benettin et al. and Lichtenberg et al. in this volume. In\nmost of the physical situations where the strength of the perturbation (i.e.,\n\n19\n\n\f20\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nFig. 1.8. Time averaged fraction of energy, in all the modes k = 1, . . . , 32. The\nparameters of the system are N = 32, \u03b1 = 3, \u01eb = 0.1 and energy density E =\nEtot /N = 1.2. (Courtesy of G. Benettin [66]).\n\nthe Hamiltonian) is fixed, the control parameter is E. There exists a critical\nenergy density, separating regular from chaotic behaviors. This is evident by\ncomparing Fig. 1.8 with Fig. 1.7. In Fig. 1.8 the same quantities of Fig. 1.7\nare plotted, but now they refer to a system where the energy density is much\ngreater than before: E = 1.2; the system has entered the chaotic region and\nequipartition is established.\nHowever, also when most KAM tori are destroyed, and the system turns\nout to be chaotic, the validity of ordinary statistical mechanics is not automatically granted. Indeed the relaxation time for reaching equipartition\nmay become very large (see Ref.s [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79] for a detailed\ndiscussion about this point).\nThe problem of slow relaxation is rather common in high dimensional\nHamiltonian systems, where [80, 81] though the phase-space volume occupied\nby KAM tori decreases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom\n(which sounds like a good news for statistical mechanics) nonetheless very\nlong time-scales are involved. This means that it takes an extremely long time\nfor the individual trajectories to forget their initial conditions and to invade\na non negligible part of the phase space. Indeed, even for very large systems,\nArnol'd diffusion is very weak and different trajectories, although with a high\nvalue of the Lyapunov exponent, maintain some of their own features for a\nvery long time.\nWe conclude this part emphasizing that also in high dimensional systems the actual role of chaos is not yet well understood. For instance, in\n[82] detailed numerical computations on the FPU system show that both the\ninternal energy and the specific heat, computed with a time average, as functions of the temperature are rather close to the prediction of the canonical\nensemble. This is true also in the low energy region (i.e. low temperature)\n\n\f1.3 The heritage of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem for the statistical mechanics\n\nwhere the system behaves in a regular way (the KAM tori are dominant).\nThis supports Khinchin approach (though the observables are not in the\nclass of the sum functions6 ) on the poor role of dynamics. Indeed strong\nchaos seems to be unnecessary for the prediction of the statistical mechanics\nto hold. However, this is not the end of the story because in other nonlinear\nsystems (such as a chain of coupled rotators) the situation is different: even in\npresence of strong chaos one can observe disagreement between time average\nand ensemble average [82].\nIn the following we discuss the problem of heat transport that allows us\nto discuss the role of chaos for the validity of transport properties.\n1.3.2 Heat transport in chaotic and non-chaotic systems\nAs stated in the introduction a part of the statistical mechanics community\naccepts the picture according to which the instabilities of microscopic particle\ndynamics are the basic requirement for the onset of macroscopic transport.\nIn this framework, several works [13, 14] have shown that, in some systems,\nthere exists a relationship between transport coefficients (thermal or electrical conductivity, viscosity, diffusivity etc.) and Lyapunov exponents. Such\na link is of remarkable importance because it establishes a straightforward\nconnection between the microscopic dynamical properties of a system and\nits macroscopic behavior, which is the main goal of statistical mechanics.\nHowever, as exemplified in the previous sections, chaotic dynamics does not\nseem to be a necessary condition to both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics approaches. In fact, we have seen that transport may\noccur even in the absence of deterministic chaos. These counterexamples pose\nsome doubts on the generality and so on the conceptual relevance of the links\nfound between chaotic indicators and macroscopic transport coefficients.\nHeat conduction is a typical phenomenon that needs a microscopic mechanism leading to normal diffusion that distributes particles and their energy\nacross the whole system. Since a chaotic motion has the same statistical properties of a \"random walk\", when observed at finite resolution, this mechanism\ncan be found in the presence of either exponential instability in deterministic\ndynamics or intrinsic disorder and nonlinearities.\nIn the context of the conduction problem, FPU chains have recently played\nan important role in further clarifying the transport properties of low spatial\ndimension systems. FPU models represent simple but non trivial candidates\nto study heat transport by phonons in solids whenever their boundaries are\nkept at different temperatures. This issue becomes even more interesting at\nlow spatial dimensions where the constraints set by the geometry may induce\n6\n\nPN\n\nKhinchin defines sum functions as any function of the form n=1 fn (qn , pn ), fn\nassuming order 1 values. Such observables, in the large N limit, are self-averaging,\ni.e. they are practically constant on the constant-energy surface, aside a region\nof small measure.\n\n21\n\n\f22\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\nanomalous transport properties characterized by the presence of divergent\ntransport coefficients in the thermodynamic limit [83]. Thermal conductivity\n\u03c7, defined via the Fourier's Law\nJ = \u2212\u03c7\u2207T,\nrelates the heat (energy) flux J to a temperature gradient. When a small\ntemperature difference \u03b4T = T1 \u2212 T2 is applied to the ends of a system of\nlinear size L, the heat current across the system is expected to be\nJ =\u2212\n\n\u03c7\u03b4T\n.\nL\n\nFor some one- and even two-dimensional systems, theoretical arguments, confirmed by several simulations, predict a scaling behavior J \u223c L\u03b1\u22121 implying\na size dependent conductivity\n\u03c7(L) = L\u03b1 .\n\n(1.20)\n\nAs a consequence, \u03c7 diverges in the limit L \u2192 \u221e with a power law whose\nexponent \u03b1 > 0 depends on the specific system considered. The presence of\nthis divergence is referred to as anomalous heat conduction in contrast with\nnormal conduction which, according to dimensional analysis of Fourier's Law,\nprescribes a finite limit for \u03c7. FPU chains are systems where the anomaly in\nthe heat transport is clearly observed. Its origin can be traced back to the\nexistence of low-energy modes which survive long enough to propagate freely\nbefore scattering with other modes. Such modes can carry much energy and\nsince their motion is mainly ballistic rather than diffusive, the overall heat\ntransport results to be anomalous. Models other than FPU indeed presents\nthis peculiar conduction, as widely shown in the literature [18, 84, 85]. Then\nthe issue is the general understanding of the conditions leading to this phenomenon and more specifically the role of microscopic dynamical instabilities.\nA well know chaotic system, such as the Lorentz Gas in a channel [86] configuration, provides an example of a system with normal heat conduction.\nThis model consists of a series of semicircular obstacles with radius R arranged in a lattice along a slab of size L \u00d7 h (h << L) see Fig. 1.9. As in a\nLorentz system, particles scatter against obstacles but do not interact with\neach other.\nTwo thermostats at temperatures T1 and T2 respectively are placed at\neach end of the slab to induce transport. They reinject into the system those\nparticles reaching the ends with a velocity drawn from a Gaussian velocity\ndistribution with variance proportional to the temperatures T1 and T2 . In\nthe case of semicircular obstacles the system is chaotic and one observes a\nstandard Fourier's Law [86].\nIn references [18] and [84], some non-chaotic variants of the Lorentz channel have been proposed in order to unravel the role of exponential instabilities\nin the heat conduction. In those models, called the Ehrenfest Channel, the\n\n\f11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\nT\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\nT\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\nT\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\nT\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1.3 The heritage of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem for the statistical mechanics\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\n\n2\n\nFig. 1.9. Example of channel geometry used in Ref. [86, 84] to study heat transport\nin low dimensional chaotic (upper panel) and non chaotic billiards (lower panel).\n\nsemicircular obstacles were replaced with triangular ones, so that the system is trivially non-chaotic since collisions with flat edges of the obstacles\ncannot separate trajectories more than algebraically. The results show that\nwhen two angles (e.g. \u03c6 and \u03c8) of the triangles are irrational multiple of \u03c0,\nthe system exhibits a normal heat conduction. On the contrary, for rational\nratio, such as isosceles right triangles, the conduction becomes anomalous.\nThe single particle heat flux across N cells J1 (N ) scales as J1 (N ) \u223c N \u03b1 ,\nwhile the temperature gradient behaves as 1/N implying that \u03c7(N ) diverges\nas N \u2192 \u221e. The explanation of such a divergence can be found in the singleparticle diffusivity along the channel direction which occurs in a non standard\nway. Indeed, the evolution of a large set of particles has a mean squared displacements from initial conditions which grows in time with a power law\nbehavior\nh[x(t) \u2212 x(0)]2 i \u223c tb\nwith an exponent 1 < b < 2. This super-diffusion is the unique responsible\nfor a divergent thermal conductivity independently of Lyapunov instabilities,\nsince the model has a zero Lyapunov exponents.\nWhen an Ehrenfest Channel with anomalous thermal conductivity is disordered, for instance, by randomly modulating the height of triangular obstacles or their positions along the channel, the conduction follows Fourier's law,\nbecoming normal [18]. This scenario is rather similar to that one discussed\nin Sect. 1.2.2 for diffusion on non chaotic maps.\nThe works in Refs. [83, 87, 88] suggest that the anomalous conduction\nis associated with the presence of a mean free path of energy carriers that\ncan behave abnormally in the thermodynamic limit. For FPU the long mean\nfree path is due to soliton-like ballistic modes. In the channels the long free\nflights, between consecutive particle collisions, become relevant. The above\nconsiderations suggest a very week role of chaos for heat transport, and for\ntransport in general, since also systems without exponential instability may\nshow transport, even anomalous.\n\n23\n\n\f24\n\n1 The role of chaos for the validity of statistical mechanics\n\n1.4 Concluding remarks\nThe problem of distinguishing chaos from noise cannot receive an absolute\nanswer in the framework of time series analysis. This is due to the finiteness\nof the observational data set and the impossibility to reach an arbitrary fine\nresolution and high embedding dimension. However, we can classify the signal\nbehavior, without referring to any specific model, as stochastic or deterministic on a certain range of scales.\nDiffusion may be realized in both stochastic and deterministic systems.\nIn particular, as the analysis of polygonal billiards and non-chaotic maps\n(see sect. 1.2.2) shows, chaos is not a prerequisite for observing diffusion and,\nmore in general, nontrivial statistical behaviors.\nIn a similar way, we have that for the validity of heat conduction chaos\nis not a necessary ingredient. Also in systems with zero maximal Lyapunov\nexponent (see ref.s [86, 84, 85]) the Fourier's law (or its anomalous version)\ncan hold.\nWe conclude by noticing that the poor role of exponential instability\nfor the validity of statistical laws does not seem to be limited to transport\nproblems. For instance it is worth mentioning the interesting results of Lepri\net al. [89] showing that the Gallavotti-Cohen formula [90], originally proposed\nfor chaotic systems, holds also in some non-chaotic model.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors express their gratitude to D.
