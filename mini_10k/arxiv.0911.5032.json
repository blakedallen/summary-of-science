The contrasting areas in the textures\ncorrespond to domains where the liquid crystals molecules are oriented in different\ndirections. Within a specific domain, however, the molecules are well ordered.\nTheoretical studies of these types of materials are motivated by real-world applications. Proper functioning of many practical devices relies on optical properties\nof certain liquid crystalline substances in the presence or absence of an electric field.\nTypically, a liquid crystal layer sits between two polarizers that are crossed. The liquid\ncrystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is twisted. This twisted phase\nreorients light passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the\nsecond polarizer (and reflecting back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The\ndevice thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to a liquid crystal\nlayer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually\nuntwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In such a state, the liquid crystals\nmolecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed\nby the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In\nthis way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or\nopaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters\nused to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Similar principles can be used to make\nother liquid crystal based optical devices.\nThere have been numerous attempts to formulate continuum theories describing the behavior of liquid crystals flows. We refer to the seminal papers [4, 10], where\nLeslie and Ericksen provide a mathematical description of various properties of these\nmaterials, and to Lin and Liu [12] for the first attempt to analyze the model mathematically. We point out that, to the present state of knowledge, three main types\nof liquid crystals are distinguished, termed smectic, nematic and cholesteric. The\nsmectic phase forms well-defined layers that can slide one over another in a manner\nvery similar to that of a soap. The smectics are ordered along one direction. In the\nsmectic A phase, the molecules are oriented along the layer normal, while in the smectic C phase, they are tilted away from the layer normal. These phases are liquid-like\nwithin the layers. There are many different smectic phases characterized by different\ntypes and degrees of positional and orientational order. The nematic phase appears\nto be the most common, where the molecules do not exhibit any positional order, but\nthey have long-range orientational order. Thus, the molecules flow and their center\nof mass positions are randomly distributed similarly to a liquid, but they all point in\nthe same direction (within each specific domain). Most nematics are uniaxial: they\npossess a preferred axis that is longer, with the other two being equivalent (so they can\nbe approximately described as cylinders). Some liquid crystals are biaxial nematics,\nmeaning that, in addition to orienting their long axis, they can also orient along a\nsecondary axis. Crystals in the cholesteric phase exhibit a twisting of the molecules\n2\n\n\fperpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The\nmain difference between the nematic and cholesteric phases is that the former is invariant with respect to certain reflections while the latter is not.\nIn this paper, we consider the range of temperatures typical for the nematic\nphase. As already pointed out, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rodlike molecules, with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned. Such a kind of\nanisotropic structure may be described by means of a dimensionless unit vector d ,\ncalled director, that represents the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in a\nneighborhood of any point of a reference domain. In many experiments, the samples of\nnematic liquid crystals consist of slowly moving particles, therefore a relevant approach\nmight be to study the behavior of director field d alone in the absence of velocity.\nHowever, the flow velocity u evidently disturbs the alignment of the molecules and\nalso the converse is true: a change in the alignment will produce a perturbation of the\nvelocity field u. Hence, both d and u are relevant in the dynamics, and, to a certain\nextent, also the changes of the temperature \u03b8 (internal energy). We introduce a very\nsimple non-isothermal model for nematic liquid crystals in the spirit of the simplified\nversion of the Leslie-Ericksen model proposed by Lin and Liu [11], and subsequently\nstudied in [7, 13].\nIn the proposed model, the time evolution of the velocity field u is governed\nby the standard incompressible Navier-Stokes system, with a non-isotropic stress tensor depending on \u2207x u, \u2207x d, where the transport (viscosity) coefficients vary with\ntemperature. The dynamics of d is described by means of a parabolic equation\nof Ginzburg-Landau type, with a suitable penalization term to relax the constraint\n|d| = 1. The system is supplemented by a heat equation, where the heat flux is given\nby a variant of Fourier's law in which the dependence on the director field d is taken\ninto account, see Section 2. Although such a model may seem rather naive from the\npoint of view of real-world applications, the present system of equations captures the\nessential mathematical features of the problem, and, last but not least, it is compatible with all underlying physical principles, in particular with First and Second laws\nof thermodynamics (as we shall see in Section 2.2).\nOur goal is to show existence of global-in-time weak solutions to the system,\nwithout any essential restriction imposed on the size of initial data. In order to avoid\nproblems caused by the interaction of the fluid with a kinematic boundary, we suppose\nthe latter is impermeable and perfectly smooth imposing the complete slip boundary\nconditions on the velocity u. The existence of weak solutions to the standard incompressible Navier-Stokes system was established in the celebrated paper by Leray [9].\nOne of the major open problems is to clarify whether or not the weak solutions also\nsatisfy the corresponding total energy balance, more precisely, if the kinetic energy\nof the system dissipates at the rate given by the viscous stress. Even the so-called\nsuitable weak solutions introduced by Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg [3] allow for an\nuncontrolled dissipation of the kinetic energy that may not be captured by any term\nappearing in the classical formulation of the problem. Since the loss of kinetic energy in\nany energetically closed system must be compensated by a source term in the internal\nenergy balance, the above mentioned problem causes unsurmountable mathematical\ndifficulties whenever the equations for the kinetic and internal (heat) energy are sep3\n\n\farated. To avoid this apparent difficulty, we use the idea proposed in [5] replacing the\nheat equation by the total energy balance. Of course, the price to pay is the explicit\nappearance of the pressure in the total energy balance that must be handled by refined\narguments. Apart from the fact that the resulting system is mathematically tractable,\nsuch an approach seems much closer to the physical background of the problem, being\nan exact formulation of the First law of thermodynamics.\nLet us finally mention that, with respect to [5], the main difficulty here consists\nin the proof of sufficiently strong estimates on the director field d in order to pass to the\nlimit in the approximate problem. In particular, the celebrated Gagliardo-Nirenberg\ninequality is needed in order to control the strongly nonlinear terms containing \u2207x d\nin both the momentum equation and the internal energy balance (cf. equations (2.12)\nand (2.13) below).\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we derive the model\nfollowing the standard physical principles. The weak formulation, together with the\nmain result, are stated in Section 3. In Section 4, we derive the necessary a priori\nestimates and establish weak compactness of a family of weak solutions subject to a\npriori bounds. Finally, in Section 5, we introduce a family of approximate problems,\nbased on Galerkin-type approximations, and construct a weak solution of the system.\n\n2\n\nMathematical model\n\nSuppose that the fluid occupies a bounded spatial domain \u03a9 \u2282 R3 , with a sufficiently\nregular boundary. Let \u033a = \u033a(t, x) and u = u(t, x) denote respectively the mass density\nand the velocity in the Eulerian reference system. Accordingly, the mass conservation\nis expressed by means of continuity equation\n\u2202t \u033a + div (\u033au) = 0 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere, in addition, the standard incompressibility constraint\ndiv u = 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nis relevant in the context of nematic liquid crystals.\nBy virtue of Newton's second law, the balance of momentum reads\n\u2202t (\u033au) + div (\u033au \u2297 u) = div T + \u033af ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere T is the Cauchy stress, and f is a given external force.\nMotivated by Lin and Liu [11] we consider the stress tensor in the form\nT\n\n= S \u2212 \u033a\u03bb(\u03b8) (\u2207x d \u2299 \u2207x d) \u2212 pI ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere p denotes the pressure, and S is the conventional Newtonian viscous stress\ntensor,\n\u0001\nS(\u03b8, \u2207x u) = \u03bc(\u03b8) \u2207x u + \u2207tx u .\n(2.5)\nNote that the transport coefficients \u03bc and \u03bb are functions of the absolute temperature\n\u03b8, see also a strongly related model by Blesgen [1]. More specifically, \u03bc is the viscosity\n4\n\n\fcoefficient assumed always positive, while \u03bb denotes the thermal dilatation coefficient\nthat is an increasing function of \u03b8.\nWe assume that the driving force governing the dynamics of the director d is\nof \"gradient type\" \u2202dJ , where the potential J is given by\n1\nJ(\u03b8, \u033a, d) = W (d) + G(\u03b8, \u033a) .\n\u03b8\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere G is a regular function of \u03b8 and \u033a, and W penalizes the deviation of the length\n|d| from the value 1. W may be a general function that can be written as a sum\nof a convex (possibly non smooth) part, and a smooth, but possibly non-convex one.\nA typical example is W (d) = (|d|2 \u2212 1)2 . Consequently, d satisfies the following\nequation\n1\n\u2202t d + u * \u2207x d + \u2202dW (d) = div (\u033a\u2207x d) .\n(2.7)\n\u033a\nFinally, in accordance with the First law of thermodynamics, the internal energy\nbalance reads\n\u2202t (\u033aeint ) + div (\u033aeint u) + div q = T : \u2207x u ,\n(2.8)\nwhere eint denotes the internal energy density and q its flux. Following Ericksen's\nmodel [4], the flux can be taken in the form\nq = \u2212\u03ba(\u03b8)\u2207x \u03b8 \u2212 (\u03ba|| \u2212 \u03ba\u22a5 )(\u03b8)d(d * \u2207x \u03b8),\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere \u03ba, \u03ba|| \u2212\u03ba\u22a5 are positive functions of the temperature.

Our strategy is to pass to the limit first for N \u2192 \u221e and then\nfor M \u2192 \u221e.\nThe aproximate velocity fields uN,M \u2208 C 1 ([0, T ]; XN ) solve the Faedo-Galerkin\nsystem\nZ\nZ\nd\nuN,M * v =\nuN,M \u2297 [uN,M ]M : \u2207x v\n(5.1)\ndt \u03a9\n\u03a9\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nt\n\u2212 \u03bc(\u03b8N,M ) \u2207x uN,M + \u2207x uN,M : \u2207x v + \u03bb(\u03b8N,M )\u2207x dN,M \u2299 \u2207x dN,M : \u2207x v,\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\nuN,M (0, *) * v =\n\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\nu0 * v\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor any v \u2208 XN . Here, the symbol [v]M denotes the orthogonal projection onto the\nspace span{Vn }M\nn=1 .\nThe functions dN,M are determined in terms of uN,M as the unique solution of\nthe parabolic system\n\u2202t dN,M + [uN,M ]M * \u2207x dN,M + \u2202W (dN,M ) = \u2206dN,M ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nsupplemented with\n\u2207x (dN,M )i * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0, i = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(5.3)\n\ndN,M (0, *) = d0,M ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere d0,M is a suitable smooth approximation of d0 .\nNext, given uN,M , dN,M , the temperature \u03b8N,M is evaluated my means of the\nheat equation (cf. Lady\u017eenskaja et al. [8, Chapter V, Theorem 8.1])\n\u2202t \u03b8N,M + div (\u03b8N,M uN,M ) + div qN,M = SN,M : \u2207x uN,M\n(5.5)\n\u2212 (\u03bb(\u03b8N,M )(\u2207x dN,M \u2299 \u2207x dN,M )) : \u2207x uN,M ,\nqN,M * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0,\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u03b8N,M (0, *) = \u03b80,M ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere SN,M = \u03bc(\u03b8N,M ) (\u2207x uN,M + \u2207tx uN,M ), and\nqN,M = \u2212\u03ba(\u03b8N,M )\u2207x \u03b8N,M \u2212 (\u03ba|| \u2212 \u03ba\u22a5 )(\u03b8N,M )dN,M (dN,M * \u2207x \u03b8N,M ).\nFinally, the pressure pN,M is determined as the unique solution of a system of\nintegral identities\nZ\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\npN,M \u2206\u03c6 =\nSN,M \u2212\u03bb(\u03b8N,M )\u2207x dN,M \u2299\u2207x dN,M \u2212uN,M \u2297[uN,M ]M : \u22072x \u03c6 (5.8)\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\n11\n\n\fsatisfied for any test function \u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9), \u2207x \u03c6 * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0. In particular, we immediately deduce the estimate\nkpN,M kL2 ((0,T )\u00d7\u03a9) \u2264 C(M) .\nNow, taking H(\u03b8) = (1 + \u03b8)\u03bd , with \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1/2), in (4.12), we get\nk\u2202t \u03b8\u03bdN,M k(C 0 ([0,T ];W 1,r (\u03a9)))\u2217 \u2264 Ck\u2202t \u03b8\u03bdN,M kL1 ((0,T )\u00d7\u03a9) \u2264 C,\nwhere C is a positive constant independent of N and M , with r \u2208 (3, +\u221e), \u03bd \u2208\n(0, 1/2).\nRegularizing the convective terms in (5.1), (5.2) is in the spirit of Leray's original\napproach [9] to the Navier-Stokes system. As a result, we recover the internal energy\nequality at the level of the limit N \u2192 \u221e. This fact, in turn, enables us to replace\nthe internal energy equation (5.5) by the total energy balance before performing the\nlimit M \u2192 \u221e. For fixed M, N , problem (5.1 - 5.8) can be solved by means of\na simple fixed point argument, exactly as in [6, Chapter 3]. Note that all a priori\nbounds derived formally in Section 4 apply to our approximate problem. Thus given\nu \u2208 C([0, T ]; XN ), we find d = d[u] solving (5.2 - 5.4), and then \u03b8 = \u03b8[u, d] and\nthe pressure p satisfying (5.5 - 5.8). Plugging these d, \u03b8 in (5.1) we may find a new\nfunction T [u] defining thus a mapping u 7\u2192 T [u]. Given the a priori bounds obtained\nin Section 4, we can easily show that T possesses a fixed point by means of the classical\nSchauder's argument, at least on a possibly short time interval. However, using once\nmore the a priori estimates we easily conclude that the approximate solutions can be\nextended on any fixed time interval [0, T ] (see [6, Chapter 6] for details).\n\n5.1\n\nPassage to the limit as N \u2192 \u221e\n\nHaving established the existence of the approximate solutions uN,M , dN,M , \u03b8N,M ,\nand pN,M , we let N \u2192 \u221e and use the uniform bounds established in Section 4 to\nobtain\nuN,M \u2192 uM weakly-(*) in L\u221e (0, T ; L2 (\u03a9; R3 )) \u2229 L2 (0, T ; W 1,2(\u03a9; R3 )) ,\n\u2202t uN,M \u2192 \u2202t uM weakly in L2 (0, T ; (W 1,2(\u03a9; R3 ))\u2217 ) ,\npN,M \u2192 pM weakly in L2 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) ,\n\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n(5.11)\n\n\u03b8\u03bdN,M \u2192 \u03b8\u03bdM weakly-(*) in L2 (0, T ; W 1,2(\u03a9)) \u2229 L\u221e (0, T ; L1/\u03bd (\u03a9)) ,\n\n(5.12)\n\n\u2202t \u03b8\u03bdN,M \u2192 \u2202t \u03b8\u03bdM weakly-(*) in (C0 (0, T ; W 1,r (\u03a9)))\u2217 ,\n\u221e\n\n1,2\n\n3\n\n(5.13)\n4\n\ndN,M \u2192 dM weakly-(*) in L (0, T ; W (\u03a9; R )) \u2229 L (0, T ; W\n\u2202t dN,M \u2192 \u2202t dM weakly in L4 (0, T ; L4 (\u03a9; R3 )) ,\n\n2,4\n\n3\n\n(\u03a9; R )) ,\n\n(5.14)\n(5.15)\n\nfor any \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1/2), and r > 3. Note that at this stage M remains fixed in the\nconvective term uN,M \u2297 [uN,M ]M .\nHence, applying the Aubin-Lions compactness lemma (cf. [15]), we deduce that\nuN,M \u2192 uM strongly in L2 (0, T ; L2 (\u03a9; R3 )) ,\n\u03b8N,M \u2192 \u03b8 strongly in Lp ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9)\n12\n\n(5.16)\n(5.17)\n\n\ffor any p \u2208 [1, 5/3). Moreover, at this level of approximation, the director field dM\nis regular, and, in particular, we have\n\u2207x dN,M \u2192 \u2207x dM strongly in L4 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) .\nHence, we can perform the limit passage\n\u03bb(\u03b8N,M )(\u2207x dN,M \u2299 \u2207x dN,M ) : \u2207x uN,M\n\u2192 \u03bb(\u03b8M )(\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) : \u2207x uM in, say, L1 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9).\nThus we may infer that the limit quantities uM , dM , \u03b8M , and pM solve the\nproblem\nZ\nuM (t, *) * \u2207x \u03c6 = 0 for a.a. t \u2208 (0, T )\n(5.18)\n\u03a9\n\nfor any test function \u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9),\nZ\n\nT\n\n0\n\nZ \u0010\n\u0011 Z\nuM * \u2202t \u03c6 + uM \u2297 [uM ]M : \u2207x \u03c6 =\n\u03a9\n\nT\n0\n\nZ\n\nTM\n\n: \u2207x \u03c6 \u2212\n\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\nu0 * \u03c6(0, *) (5.19)\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor any \u03c6 \u2208 C0\u221e ([0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9; R3 ), \u03c6 * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0,\n\u2202t dM + [uM ]M * \u2207x dM + \u2202W (dM ) = \u2206dM ,\n\na.e. in (0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9,\n\n(5.20)\n\nsupplemented with\n\u2207x (dM )i * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0, i = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(5.21)\n\ndM (0, *) = d0,M ,\n\n(5.22)\n\nand\n\u2202t \u03b8M + div (\u03b8M uM ) + div qM \u2265 SM : \u2207x uM \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b8M )(\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) : \u2207x uM (5.23)\nin the sense of distributions with non-negative test functions,\nqM * n|\u2202\u03a9 = 0,\n\n(5.24)\n\n\u03b8M (0, *) = \u03b80,M ,\n\n(5.25)\n\ntogether with the total energy balance\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n1\nd\n|uM |2 + \u03b8M = 0,\ndt \u03a9 2\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhere\nTM\n\n= SM \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b8M ) (\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) \u2212 pM I ,\n\n(5.27)\n\n\u0001\n= \u03bc(\u03b8M ) \u2207x uM + \u2207tx uM .\n\n(5.28)\n\nand\nSM\n\n13\n\n\fMoreover, since the convective term uM \u2297 [uM ]M is regular (and consequently\n\u2202t uM \u2208 L2 (0, T ; (W 1,2(\u03a9; R3 ))\u2217 )), we can take uM as a test function in (5.19) to\nrecover the kinetic energy balance in the form\nkuM (t)k2L2 (\u03a9)\n\n+\n\nZ tZ\n0\n\n+2\n\nZ t \u03a9Z\n0\n\n\u03bc(\u03b8M )|\u2207x uM + \u2207tx uM |2 = ku0 k2L2 (\u03a9)\n\u03bb(\u03b8M )(\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) : \u2207x uM .\n\n(5.29)\n\n\u03a9\n\nSimilarly, taking v = uN,M in (5.1) we get\nkuN,M (t)k2L2 (\u03a9)\n\n+\n\nZ tZ\n0\n\n+2\n\nZ t \u03a9Z\n0\n\n\u03bc(\u03b8M,N )|\u2207x uN,M + \u2207tx uN,M |2 = ku0 k2L2 (\u03a9)\n\u03bb(\u03b8N,M )(\u2207x dN,M \u2299 \u2207x dN,M ) : \u2207x uN,M .\n\n\u03a9\n\nPassing to the limit N \u2192 \u221e in the last equation, using (5.16) and (3.13), and comparing the result with (5.29), we conclude, by means of (3.12), that\n\u2207x uN,M \u2192 \u2207x uM strongly in L2 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) .\n\n(5.30)\n\nAccordingly, the inequality (5.23) may be replaced by\n\u2202t \u03b8M + div (\u03b8M uM ) + div qM = SM : \u2207x uM \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b8M )(\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) : \u2207x uM . (5.31)\nAs a matter of fact, (5.31) already follows from (5.23), (5.26), and (5.29).\nMoreover, taking in (5.19) uM \u03c6 (with \u03c6 \u2208 D((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9)) in place of \u03c6, we get\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u00121\n\u0011\n1\n2\n2\n|uM | + \u03b8M + div\n|uM | + \u03b8M [uM ]M + div (pM uM ) + div qM (5.32)\n\u2202t\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= div (SM uM ) \u2212 div \u03bb(\u03b8M ) (\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM ) uM in D \u2032 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) .\nThis concludes the passage to the limit for N \u2192 \u221e.\n\n5.2\n\nPassage to the limit as M \u2192 \u221e\n\nOur final goal is to let M \u2192 \u221e (5.19\u20135.26). We notice that the limits in (5.9),\n(5.12\u20135.13), (5.16\u20135.17) still hold when letting M \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, we have\n\u2202t uM \u2192 \u2202t u weakly in L5/3 (0, T ; W \u22121,5/3(\u03a9; R3 )) ,\n\n(5.33)\n\npM \u2192 p weakly in L5/3 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) ,\ndM \u2192 d weakly-(*) in L\u221e ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9; R3 ) \u2229 L\u221e (0, T ; W 1,2(\u03a9; R3 ))\n\u2229 L2 (0, T ; W 2,2(\u03a9; R3 )) ,\n\n(5.34)\n(5.35)\n\n\u2202t dM \u2192 \u2202t d weakly in L2 (0, T ; L3/2 (\u03a9; R3 )) .\n\n(5.36)\n\n14\n\n\fNow, we can easily pass to the limit M \u2192 \u221e in (5.18\u20135.22) to recover (3.6\u20133.8).\nIn addition, by virtue of (4.2), (4.9), (4.14), we get\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n|uM |2\n+ pM [uM ]M\nbounded in L10/9 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) ,\n2\nM >0\n{\u03b8M uM }M >0 bounded in Lq (0, T ; Lq (\u03a9)) for any q \u2208 [1, 10/9) ,\n{SM uM }M >0 bounded in L5/4 ((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) ,\n{\u03bb(\u03b8M )(\u2207x dM \u2299 \u2207x dM )uM }M >0 bounded in L5/4 (0, T ; L5/4 (\u03a9)) .\nConsequently, we can pass to the limit in (5.32) to deduce the desired conclusion (3.9).\nFinally, as convex functionals are weakly lower semicontinuous, we can see that\n(5.23) gives rise to\n\u2202t \u03b8 + div (\u03b8u) + div q \u2265 S : \u2207x u \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b8)(\u2207x d \u2299 \u2207x d) : \u2207x u in D \u2032((0, T ) \u00d7 \u03a9) .
