Let H be a separable complex Hilbert space. Denote by G\u221e (H)\nthe Grassmannian consisting of closed linear subspaces with infinite dimension\nand codimension. This Grassmannian is partially ordered by the inclusion relation. We show that every continuous order preserving bijective transformation\nof G\u221e (H) is induced by an invertible bounded semi-linear operator.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet H be a separable (real or complex) Hilbert space. We write G(H) for the\nlattice of closed linear subspaces of H. The group of invertible bounded linear\noperators acts on G(H) and the orbits of this action is called Grassmannians:\n\u2022 Gk (H) consists of k-dimensional linear subspaces,\n\u2022 G k (H) consists of closed linear subspaces with codimension k,\n\u2022 G\u221e (H) consists of closed linear subspaces with infinite dimension and codimension.\nEvery closed linear subspace S \u2282 H can be identified with the orthogonal (selfadjoint) projection pS : H \u2192 S, then G(H) and all our Grassmannian are closed\nsubsets in the Banach algebra with the standard operator norm. In other words,\nthese are complete metric spaces with the distance ||PS \u2212 PU || (we refer [4] for some\nelementary topological properties of the Grassmannians).\nLet us consider the Grassmannian G\u221e (H) which is partially ordered by the\ninclusion relation.\nIn the real case, Mackey's result [2] states that every automorphism of the lattice\nG(H) is induced by an invertible bounded linear operator, and it was shown by\nauthor [3] that every order preserving bijective transformation of G\u221e (H) can be\nextended to an automorphism of the lattice. In the present paper complex versions\nof these results will be given.\nNow suppose that our Hilbert space is complex. We say that A : H \u2192 H is a\nsemi-linear operator if\nA(x + y) = A(x) + A(y)\nfor all x, y \u2208 H and there exists an automorphism \u03c3 : C \u2192 C such that\nA(ax) = \u03c3(a)A(x)\nfor all a \u2208 C and x \u2208 H. If A is a non-zero bounded semi-linear operator then the\nassociated automorphism \u03c3 : C \u2192 C is continuous. Since \u03c3(q) = q for every q \u2208 Q\nand \u03c3(i) = \u00b1i, one of the following possibilities is realized:\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46C05, 14M15.\nKey words and phrases. Hilbert grassmannian, order preserving transformation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMARK PANKOV\n\n\u2022 \u03c3 is identical and A is linear,\n\u2022 \u03c3 is the complex conjugate mapping and A(ax) = \u0101A(x) for all a \u2208 C,\nx \u2208 H.\nNote that non-continuous automorphisms of C exist.\nEvery invertible bounded semi-linear operator induces a continuous order preserving bijective transformation of G\u221e (H). Conversely, the following statement will\nbe proved.\nTheorem 1. Every continuous order preserving bijective transformation of G\u221e (H)\nis induced by an invertible bounded semi-linear operator.\nIn the real case [3], we do not require continuity.\n2. Hilbert projective spaces\nLet H be, as in the previous section, a separable (real or complex) Hilbert space.\nConsider the associated Hilbert projective space \u03a0H whose points are 1-dimensional\nlinear subspaces and whose lines are defined by 2-dimensional linear subspaces of\nH. It is clear that lines are closed and all closed subspaces of \u03a0H are induced\nby closed linear subspaces of H. The projective space whose points are closed\nhyperplanes and whose lines are defined by closed linear subspaces of codimension\n2 will be called the dual Hilbert projective space and denoted by \u03a0\u2217H . The mapping\nS \u2192 S \u22a5 (S \u22a5 is the orthogonal complement) induces an isometry between Gk (H)\nand G k (H). By this mapping, \u03a0H and \u03a0\u2217H are canonically isomorphic as metric\nprojective spaces.\nIt was proved in [2] that every collineation of \u03a0H preserving the class of closed\nhyperplanes (\"closed\" collineation) is induced by an invertible bounded linear operator if H is real. If our Hilbert space is complex then the following \"weak\" version\nof Mackey's result is true.\nTheorem 2. Every continuous collineation of \u03a0H is induced by an invertible\nbounded semi-linear operator.\nTo prove Theorem 2 we use the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let A : H \u2192 H be an invertible semi-linear operator such that the\nassociated automorphism of C is identical or the complex conjugate mapping. If A\npreserves G 1 (H) then it is bounded.\nProof. Similar to the proof of Lemma B in [2].\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 2. Let f : G1 (H) \u2192 G1 (H) be a continuous collineation of \u03a0H .\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry [1], there exists an invertible\nsemi-linear operator A : H \u2192 H such that\nf (P ) = A(P )\nfor all P \u2208 G1 (H). For the associated automorphism \u03c3 : C \u2192 C one of the following\npossibilities is realized:\n(1) the restriction of \u03c3 to Q + Qi is identical,\n(2) \u03c3 transfers p + qi to p \u2212 qi for each p, q \u2208 Q.\nSuppose that x, y \u2208 H are linearly independent and g is the continuous collineation\nof \u03a0H induced by an invertible bounded semi-linear operator transferring A(x) and\nA(y) to x and y, respectively; we require that the associated automorphism \u03c6 is\n\n\fORDER PRESERVING TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE HILBERT GRASSMANNIAN\n\n3\n\nidentical or the complex conjugate mapping in the case (1) or (2), respectively; in\nother words, the restriction of \u03c6\u03c3 to Q + Qi is identical. Then gf preserves the line\nof \u03a0H joining hxi and hyi, and it transfers hx + ayi to hx + \u03c6\u03c3(a)yi. Since\nhx + byi, b \u2208 Q + Qi\nform an everywhere dense subset in the line, the restriction of gf to the line is\nidentical. Hence \u03c3 = \u03c6. We apply Lemma 1 and finish the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 1. It follows from Theorem 2 that every continuous automorphism of the\nlattice G(H) is induced by an invertible bounded semi-linear operator.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1\nWe will use the following trivial remark concerning the automorphisms of G(H)\ninduced by invertible bounded semi-linear operators. If A : H \u2192 H is an invertible\nbounded semi-linear operator then the transformation\nS \u2192 (A(S \u22a5 ))\u22a5\nis induced by the operator (A\u2217 )\u22121 , where A\u2217 is the adjoint operator. Recall that\nA\u2217 : H \u2192 H is defined by the formula\n(A\u2217 x, y) = (x, Ay)\n\n\u2200 x, y \u2208 H\n\n(A\u2217 x, y) = (x, Ay)\n\n\u2200 x, y \u2208 H\n\nor\nif the associated automorphism of C is identical or the complex conjugate mapping,\nrespectively.\nLet f : G\u221e (H) \u2192 G\u221e (H) be a continuous order preserving bijection.\nLemma 2. Let S \u2208 G\u221e (H) and X be the set of all elements of G\u221e (H) contained\nin S. There exists an invertible bounded semi-linear operator A : S \u2192 f (S) such\nthat\nf (U ) = A(U ) \u2200 U \u2208 X .\nProof. We suppose that f (S) = S, since in the general case we can take an invertible bounded linear operator C : H \u2192 H which sends f (S) to S and consider\nthe transformation U \u2192 C(f (U )). The restriction of f to G 1 (S) is a continuous\ncollineation of \u03a0\u2217S . Then\nP \u2192 (f (P \u22a5 \u2229 S))\u22a5 \u2229 S\n\n\u2200 P \u2208 G1 (S)\n\nis a continuous collineation of \u03a0S . By Theorem 2, it is induced by an invertible\nbounded semi-linear operator B : S \u2192 S. Hence the restriction of f to G 1 (S) is\ninduced by the operator\nA := (B \u2217 )\u22121 .\nLet [U ]1 be the set of all elements of G 1 (S) containing U \u2208 X . Since f is order\npreserving,\nf ([U ]1 ) = [f (U )]1 ;\non the other hand,\nf ([U ]1 ) = A([U ]1 ) = [A(U )]1 .\nThus f (U ) = A(U ) and A is as required.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nMARK PANKOV\n\nRemark 2. In the real case, an order preserving transformation is not assumed\nto be continuous and the proof of the analogous lemma (Lemma 3 in [3]) is more\ncomplicated.\nLemma 3. Let S and U be elements of G\u221e (H) such that S \u2214U (the minimal closed\nlinear subspace containing S + U ) belongs to G\u221e (H). Then\ndim(S \u2229 U ) = dim(f (S) \u2229 f (U )).\n\u0003\n\nProof. Lemma 4 in [3].\n\nIf S and U are closed linear subspaces of finite dimension and codimension (respectively) then we write [S] and [U ] for the sets of all elements of G\u221e (H) containing\nS and contained in U , respectively. Using Lemma 3, we establish the following.\nLemma 4. For every S \u2208 Gk (H) and U \u2208 G k (H) there exist S \u2032 \u2208 Gk (H) and\nU \u2032 \u2208 G k (H) such that\nf ([S]) = [S \u2032 ] and f ([U ]) = [U \u2032 ].\n\u0003\n\nProof. Lemmas 5 and 6 in [3].\n\nTherefore f can be extended to an automorphisms of G(H). By the Fundamental\nTheorem of Projective Geometry, it is induced by an invertible semi-linear operator.\nLemma 2 guarantees that the associated automorphism of C is identical or the\ncomplex conjugate mapping. Since our operator preserves G 1 (H), Lemma 1 gives\nthe claim.\n4. Remark\nSuppose that A : H \u2192 H is an invertible bounded semi-linear operator such\nthat A and A\u2217 give the same transformation of G\u221e (H) which will be denoted by\nf . In other words, A\u2217 = aA for a certain scalar a. If A is linear then\nA = A\u2217\u2217 = (aA)\u2217 = \u0101A\u2217 = |a|2 A\n(a = \u00b11 in the real case) in the real and the complex case, respectively; thus |a| = 1.\nIf A is over the complex conjugate mapping then (aA)\u2217 = aA\u2217 and we get a = \u00b11.\nIt is easy to see that\n(1)\n\n\u2200 S, U \u2208 G\u221e (H)\n\nS \u22a5 f (U ) \u21d0\u21d2 f (S) \u22a5 U.\n\nNow we prove the following.\nLemma 5. If a bijective transformation f of G\u221e (H) satisfies (1) then it is order\npreserving.\nProof. Since a linear subspace is contained in S \u2208 G\u221e (H) if and only it is orthogonal\nto S \u22a5 , the condition (1) guarantees that f sends the set of all elements of G\u221e (H)\ncontained in S to the set of all elements of G\u221e (H) contained in the subspace\nf \u2032 (S) := f \u22121 (S \u22a5 )\u22a5 .\nThis means that the bijection f \u2032 is order preserving. Then f \u22121 is order preserving\nand we get the claim.\n\u0003\n\n\fORDER PRESERVING TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE HILBERT GRASSMANNIAN\n\n5\n\nLet f be as in Lemma 5. If H is real then it follows from the main result of\n[3] that f is induced by an invertible bounded linear operator A : H \u2192 H. In\nthe complex case, Theorem 1 implies that our transformation f is induced by an\ninvertible bounded semilinear operator A : H \u2192 H if it is continuous. In each of\nthese cases, (1) shows that\nA(T ) = A\u22121 (T \u22a5 )\u22a5\nfor every T \u2208 G\u221e (H); hence A and A\u2217 gives the same transformation of G\u221e (H).\nReferences\n[1] Baer R., Projective Geometry and Linear Algebra, Academic Press, New York 1952.\n[2] Mackey G.
