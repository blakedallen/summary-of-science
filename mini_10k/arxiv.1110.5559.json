INTRODUCTION\nWith this work, in a theoretical context, it is intended to explain the complementarily of clustering\nmodels, associated with the New Economic Geography, and polarization associated with the Keynesian tradition,\ndescribing the mechanisms by which these processes are based. It is pretended also studying the Portuguese\nregional agglomeration process, using the linear form the New Economic Geography models that emphasize the\nimportance of factors in explaining the spatial concentration of economic activity in certain locations (1)(Martinho\nand Soukiazis, 2003).\nOne of the most recent publications of (2)Fujita, Krugman and Venables (Fujita et al., 2000) presents\nitself as a good contribution for the systematization of these developments, which can be summarized in a\ndiagram like figure 1.\n\n\uf06d, \uf073 , \uf074\n\nReal\n\nEmployees\n\nwage \uf0ad \uf0de (Forward\nlinkages)\n\nFirms\n\n\uf0ad\uf0de\n\nTransport\n\n(Backward\nlinkages)\n\n\uf0ad\uf0de\n\ncosts\n\nReal\n\n\uf0af\uf0de\n\nPrices\n\n\uf0af\uf0de\n\nwage \uf0ad\n\nCentripetal forces\nFigure 1: A mechanism that describes the process of agglomeration\n\nIn Figure 2, is developed the mechanism that explains the process of polarization, based on the forces\nof demand, increasing economies of scale (in industry) and endogenous factors of production, among others\n(3)(Targetti et al., 1989).

DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL, THE DATA AND THE ESTIMATES MADE\nTo analyze the goals set for this work, it was considered only the equation of real wages, from the\nequations of static equilibrium, in reduced form (equation (1)) and linear (equation (2)). The choice, only for this\nequation and in linear form, is due to the complexity found when working on the one hand, the equations in a\nnonlinear way, and secondly, a system of nonlinear equations.\n\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f9\n\uf077 r \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0e5 YsTrs1\uf02d\uf073 Gs\uf073 \uf02d1 \uf0fa\n\uf0eb s\n\uf0fb\n\n1/ \uf073\n\n\uf0e9\n1\uf02d\uf073 \uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0e5 \uf06c s ( ws Tsr ) \uf0fa\n\uf0eb s\n\uf0fb\n\n\uf02d \uf06d /(1\uf02d\uf073 )\n\n, equation of real wages reduced\n\n(1)\n\nLinearizing the reduced equation (1), using logarithms, we obtain:\n\nlog( \uf077 r ) \uf03d\n\n\uf06d\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f9\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f9\nlog \uf0ea\uf0e5 Ys Trs1\uf02d\uf073 Gs\uf073 \uf02d1 \uf0fa \uf02d\nlog \uf0ea\uf0e5 \uf06c s ( ws Tsr )1\uf02d\uf073 \uf0fa ,\n\uf073\n\uf0eb s\n\uf0fb (1 \uf02d \uf073 )\n\uf0eb s\n\uf0fb\n1\n\n(2)\n\nIt should be noted that in the estimations made with the equations presented below, all variables were\nconsidered at national or regional level for 5 regions (NUTS II) of Portugal, and in time series of 8 years. All data\nfor these variables were obtained from the regional database of Eurostat statistics (Eurostat Regio of Statistics\n2000).\n2.1. EQUATION LINEARIZED AND REDUCED OF THE REAL WAGES, WITH THE VARIABLES\nINDEPENDENT NATIONALLY AGGREGATED\nThus, the equation of real wages that will be estimated in its linear form, will be a function of the\nfollowing explanatory variables:\n\nln \uf077 rt \uf03d f 0 \uf02b f1 ln Y pt \uf02b f 2 ln Trpt \uf02b f 3 ln G pt \uf02b f 4 ln \uf06c pt \uf02b f 5 ln w pt \uf02b f 6 ln T prt \uf02b f 7 ln Prt ,\nwhere:\n-\n\n\uf077rt\n\nis the real wage in region r (5 regions) for each of the manufacturing industries (9 industries);\n\n- Ypt is the gross value added of each of the manufacturing industries at the national level;\n- Gpt is the price index at the national level;\n- \uf06c is the number of workers in each industry, at national level;\npt\n\n- Wpt is the nominal wage for each of the industries at the national level;\n- Trpt is the flow of goods from each of the regions to Portugal;\n- Tprt is the flow of goods to each of the regions from Portugal;\n- Prt is the regional productivity for each industry;\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\f- p indicates Portugal and r refers to each of the regions.\nThe results obtained in the estimations of this equation are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\nTable 1: Estimation of the equation of real wages with the independent variables aggregated at national level\n(without productivity), 1987-1994\n\nln \uf077 rt \uf03d f 0 \uf02b f1 ln Y pt \uf02b f 2 ln Trpt \uf02b f 3 ln G pt \uf02b f 4 ln \uf06c pt \uf02b f 5 ln w pt \uf02b f 6 ln T prt\nVariable\n\nlnYpt\n\nlnTrpt\n\nlnGpt\n\nCoefficient\nf1\nf2*\nf3*\nLSDV\n-0.038\n0.674\n-0.967\nCoefficients\n(-0.970)\n(4.227)\n(-7.509)\nT-stat.\n(0.333)\n(0.000)\n(0.000)\nL. signif.\nDegrees of freedom\n290\nNumber\nof\n302\nobervations\nStandard deviation\n0.146 T.HAUSMAN - 416.930\n\nln \uf06c pt\n\nlnwpt\n\nlnTprt\n\nf4\n\nf5*\n\nf6*\n\n0.025\n(0.511)\n(0.610)\n\n0.937\n(15.239)\n(0.000)\n\n-0.594\n(-3.787)\n(0.000)\n\nR2\n\nDW\n\n0.810\n\n1.516\n\n(*) Coefficient statistically significant at 5%.\nTable 2: Estimation of the equation of real wages with the independent variables aggregated at national level\n(with productivity), 1987-1994\n\nln \uf077 rt \uf03d f 0 \uf02b f1 ln Y pt \uf02b f 2 ln Trpt \uf02b f 3 ln G pt \uf02b f 4 ln \uf06c pt \uf02b f 5 ln w pt \uf02b f 6 ln T prt \uf02b f 7 ln Prt\nVariable\n\nlnYpt\n\nlnTrpt\n\nlnGpt\n\nCoefficient\nf1*\nf2*\nf3*\nLSDV\n-0.259\n0.557\n-0.884\nCoefficients\n(-7.064)\n(4.422)\n(-9.671)\nT-stat.\n(0.000)\n(0.000)\n(0.000)\nL. signif.\nDegrees of freedom\n289\nNumber\nof\n302\nobervations\nStandard deviation\n0.126 T.HAUSMAN - 7086.989*\n\nln \uf06c pt\n\nlnwpt\n\nlnTprt\n\nlnPrt\n\nf4*\n\nf5*\n\nf6*\n\nf7*\n\n0.256\n(5.919)\n(0.000)\n\n0.883\n(19.180)\n(0.000)\n\n-0.493\n(-3.996)\n(0.000)\n\n0.258\n(10.443)\n(0.000)\n\nR2\n\nDW\n\n0.858\n\n1.560\n\n(*) Coefficient statistically significant at 5%.\nThis equation 3 estimated of real wages presents satisfactory results in terms of statistical significance\nof coefficients, the degree of adjustment and autocorrelation of errors. For the signs of the estimated coefficients\nthat represent the respective elasticities, taking into account the expected by the economic theory, we confirm\nthat, apart the gross value added, the price index and the nominal wages per employee, all coefficients have the\nexpected signs.\n2.2. LINEARIZED AND REDUCED EQUATION OF REAL WAGES, WITH THE VARIABLES\nINDEPENDENT REGIONALLY DISAGGREGATED\nFollowing it is presented the equation of real wages reduced and in a linear form, but now with the\nindependent variables disaggregated at regional level, in other words, considered only for the region being\nanalyzed, and not for the whole of Portugal, as in the previous equation. Although this equation does not\nconsider the effect of nearby regions of r in this region, aims to be a simulation to determine the effect of the\nregions in their real wages, that is:\n\nln \uf077 rt \uf03d f 0 \uf02b f1 ln Yrt \uf02b f 2 ln Trpt \uf02b f 3 ln Grt \uf02b f 4 ln \uf06crt \uf02b f 5 ln wrt \uf02b f 6 ln T prt\n\n(4)\n\nwhere:\n-\n\n\uf077rt is the real wage in the region r, for each of the manufacturing industries;\n\n- Yrt is the gross value added of each of the manufacturing industries at the regional level;\n- Grt is the price index at the regional level;\n- \uf06c is the number of workers in each industry, at regional level;\nrt\n\n- Wrt is the nominal wage per employee in each of the manufacturing industries at regional level;\n- Trpt is the flow of goods from each region to Portugal;\n- Tprt is the flow of goods to each of the regions from Portugal.\nTable 3 presents the results of estimating equation 4 where the independent variables are\ndisaggregated at regional level. About the signs of the coefficients, it appears that these are the expected, given\n\n3\n\n\fthe theory, the same can not be said of the variable\n\n\uf06crt\n\n(number of employees). However, it is not surprising\n\ngiven the economic characteristics of regions like the Norte (many employees and low wages) and Alentejo (few\nemployees and high salaries), two atypical cases precisely for opposite reasons. Analyzing the results in Tables\n1, 2 and 3 we confirm the greater explanatory power of the variables when considered in aggregate at the\nnational level.\nTable 3: Estimation of the equation of real wages with the independent variables disaggregated at the regional\nlevel\n\nln \uf077 rt \uf03d f 0 \uf02b f1 ln Yrt \uf02b f 2 ln Trpt \uf02b f 3 ln Grt \uf02b f 4 ln \uf06crt \uf02b f 5 ln wrt \uf02b f 6 ln T prt ,\nConst.\n\nlnYrt\n\nlnTrpt\n\nlnGrt\n\nln \uf06c rt\n\nlnwrt\n\nlnTprt\n\nf0*\n\nf1*\n\nf2*\n\nf3*\n\nf4*\n\nf5*\n\nf6*\n\nR2\n\nDW\n\n0.101\n(4.147)\n(0.000)\n\n0.629\n(4.625)\n(0.000)\n\n-0.571\n(-10.218)\n(0.000)\n\n-0.151\n(-5.364)\n(0.000)\n\n0.516\n(13.357)\n(0.000)\n\n-0.506\n(-3.985)\n(0.000)\n\n0.670\n\n1.858\n\n0.756\n\n1.934\n\n0.098*\n0.559*\n-0.624*\n(4.129)\n(4.449)\n(-11.380)\nLSDV\nDegrees of freedom\n295 - 289\nNumber of obervations 302 - 302\nStandard deviation\n0.155 - 0.165 T.HAUSMAN - 72.843*\n\n-0.155*\n(-6.130)\n\n0.619*\n(16.784)\n\n-0.411*\n(-3.511)\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\nRandom effects\nCoefficients\nT-stat.\nL. signif.\n\n1.530\n(3.355)\n(0.001)\n\n(*) Coefficient statistically significant at 5%.\n2.3. ALTERNATIVE EQUATIONS TO THE EQUATIONS 3 AND 4\nWe also made two alternative estimates in order to test the existence of multicollinearity among the\nexplanatory variables, considering all the variables by the weight of the work in every industry and every region in\nthe total industry in this region for the equation 3 and the weight of work in every industry and every region in the\nnational total of this industry for the equation 4, following procedures of (4)Hanson (1998). It is noted that the\nresults are very similar to those previously presented to the estimates of equations 3 and 4, which allows us to\nverify the absence of statistics infractions.\n2.4. EQUATION OF THE AGGLOMERATION\nIn the analysis of the Portuguese regional agglomeration process, using models of New Economic\nGeography in the linear form, we pretend to identify whether there are between Portuguese regions, or not,\nforces of concentration of economic activity and population in one or a few regions (centripetal forces). These\nforces of attraction to this theory, are the differences that arise in real wages, since locations with higher real\nwages, have better conditions to begin the process of agglomeration. Therefore, it pretends to analyze the\nfactors that originate convergence or divergence in real wages between Portuguese regions. Thus, given the\ncharacteristics of these regions will be used as the dependent variable, the ratio of real wages in each region and\nthe region's leading real wages in this case (Lisboa e Vale do Tejo), following procedures of Armstrong (1995)\nand Dewhurst and Mutis-Gaitan (1995). So, which contribute to the increase in this ratio is a force that works\nagainst clutter (centrifugal force) and vice versa.\nThus:\n\n\uf0e6\uf077 \uf0f6\nln\uf0e7\uf0e7 rt \uf0f7\uf0f7 \uf03d a0 \uf02b a1 ln Ynt \uf02b a2 ln Trl \uf02b a3 ln Lnt \uf02b a4 ln Prt \uf02b a5 ln RLrmt \uf02b a6 ln RLrgt \uf02b a7 RLrkt \uf02b a8 ln RLrnt\n\uf0e8 \uf077lt \uf0f8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere:\n- Ynt is the national gross value added of each of the manufacturing industries considered in the database used;\n- Trl is the flow of goods from each region to Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, representing the transportation costs;\n- Lnt is the number of employees in manufacturing at the national level;\n- Prt is the regional productivity (ratio of regional gross value added in manufacturing and the regional number of\nemployees employed in this activity);\n- RLrmt is the ratio between the total number of employees in regional manufacturing and the regional number of\nemployees, in each manufacturing (agglomeration forces represent inter-industry, at regional level);\n- RLrgt is the ratio between the number of regional employees in each manufacturing and regional total in all\nactivities (represent agglomeration forces intra-industry, at regional level);\n- RLrkt is the ratio between the number of regional employees in each manufacturing, and regional area\n(representing forces of agglomeration related to the size of the region);\n\n4\n\n\f- RLrnt is the ratio between the number of regional employees, in each of the manufacturing industries, and the\nnational total in each industry (agglomeration forces represent inter-regions in each of the manufacturing\nindustries considered).\nThe index r (1,..., 5) represents the respective region, t is the time period (8 years), n the entire national\nterritory, k the area (km2), l the region Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, g all sectors and m manufacturing activity (9\nindustries).\nThe results of the estimations made regarding equation 5 are shown in Tables 4 and 5.

SOME FINAL CONCLUSIONS\nWith the above analysis, it appears that the explanatory power of the independent variables considered\nin models of New Economic Geography, is more reasonable, even when these variables are considered in their\noriginal form, in other words, in the aggregate form for all locations with strong business with that we are\nconsidering (in the case studied, aggregated at national level to mainland Portugal). However, the agglomeration\nprocess of the Portuguese regions, analyzing the set of coefficients of the estimations, in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo\nis not impressive, but when we look at the data this region has a greater potential of attractiveness of the\npopulation and economic activity. This is because that's where real wages are more uniform across different\n\n5\n\n\findustries and higher than in other regions. However, the estimation results reflect some strange situations, in\nthe face of the theory, namely the fact the Norte has the highest value of employees in manufacturing, the\nhighest gross value added in this industry, but has the lowest real wages, explained possibly by the great weight\nof the textile industry in this region. The same we verify, but precisely in the contrary to the Alentejo. Perhaps, a\nfiner spatial unit could help to explain these strange situations, but the lack of data for the NUTS III prevents this\nanalysis. Anyway, the direct effect of considering large spatial units is reduced (as can be seen in Table 5 with\nthe value obtained for the variable RLrkt, or -0141). Despite some inconsistencies found in the face of the theory,\nit was possible to identify a set of centripetal forces (forces that favor the agglomeration) and a set of centrifugal\nforces (forces that work against agglomeration).\nOn the other hand, given the existence of \"backward and forward\" linkages and agglomeration\neconomies, represented in the variables Rlrmt and RLrgt, we can affirm the existence of growing scale\neconomies in the Portuguese manufacturing industry during the period considered. This taking into account the\nmentioned by (5)Marshall (1920) which in modern terminology argued that increasing returns to scale occur in\nindustry, in the face of \"spillover\" effects, advantages of market expertise and \"backward\" and \"forward\" linkages\nassociated with large local markets. Therefore, the trend during this period was for the regional divergence in\nPortugal, considering what referred by Hanson (1998), in other words, \"The interaction of scale economies and\ntransport costs creates a centripetal force, to use Krugman's language, that causes firms to agglomerate in\nindustry centers\".\nIt should be noted also that different estimates were made without the productivity variable and with this\nvariable in order to be analyzed the importance of this variable in explaining the phenomenon of agglomeration. It\nseems important to carry out this analysis, because despite the economic theory consider the wages that can be\nexplained by productivity, the new economic geography ignores it, at least explicitly, in their models, for reasons\nalready mentioned widely, particular those related to the need to make the models tractable.\nFinally, is important to refer the importance of the transportation costs in explaining the spatial issues,\nreinforced by the fact that the estimates made with the seven NUTS II Portugal (including Madeira and A\u00e7ores)\npresent values much worse than when considering only the five NUTS II. What makes sense, since the real\nwage developments do not follow the increase in transport costs from the continent for these two Portuguese\nislands.\n4. REFERENECES\n1. V.J.P. Martinho and E.
