INTRODUCTION\n\nUnderstanding electron conduction through atomic\nand molecular wires connecting two macroscopic electrodes is presently a very active research topic. Conductance measurements for metal nanocontacts display\nflat plateaus and abrupt drops during the elongation attributed to atomic rearrangements. In noble metals (Cu,\nAg, Au) and alkali metals (Li, Na, K) the last conductance step before breaking, most likely corresponding to a\nmonatomic nanocontact or a nanowire, has a value 2G0\n[1] (G0 = e2 /h is the conductance quantum per spin)\nwhich can be rationalized with the free propagation of\n2 valence s-electrons (one per each spin). For magnetic\ntransition metals such as Co and Ni the experimental\ndata are less consistent. Oshima et al. [2], who worked\nin vacuum, at variable temperature, and with the possibility of an external magnetic field, found conductance\nsteps in Ni nanocontacts preferentially near 2G0 and 4G0\nat room temperature (RT) and zero field, near 4G0 at 770\nK and zero field, and near 3G0 (occasionally near G0 ) at\nRT with a field. Ono et al. [3] reported again 2G0 for Ni\nin zero field, and G0 for Ni in a field. Recently, Rodrigues\net al. [4] observed 1 conductance quantum at RT and zero\nfield in a Co atomic chain. Ruitenbeek and collaborators\n[5] finally obtained low temperature zero field data on\na variety of magnetic metals, and reported a dominance\nof conductance steps between 2G0 and 3G0 in Co and\nNi. Despite the poor agreement between these results\nit is clear that the last conductance step is anomalously\nsmall with respect to the number of valence electrons determining the number of conducting channels, since in\nCo and Ni there are many d bands crossing the Fermi\nlevel.\nSeveral theoretical methods are available to study the\ntransport properties of atomic scale conductors, each\nof them tailored to the underlying electronic structure\n\nscheme [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Among these\nare methods based on nonequilibrium Green's functions\ncombined with a localized basis set [6, 7, 8] or with a\nsystem-independent wavelet basis set [9, 10]. A scattering approach for conductance calculation has been applied by Lang and co-workers [11], and Tsukada and coworkers [12] using the jellium model for the electrodes.\nA formulation based on the real-space finite-difference\napproach has been recently proposed and applied to\ncalculate conductance of gold and aluminum nanowires\n[13]. Recently, the KKR method using the Baranger and\nStone's formulation of the ballistic transport has been\npresented [15].\nIn order to deal with magnetic transition metals\nnanowires, we need a formulation capable of handling\naccurately the rather localized 3d electrons. The approach to the problem of d electrons based on Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudo-potentials (US-PPs) [17] has gained\nwidespread use in recent years. These PPs allow the\naccurate and efficient description of large-scale systems,\nwhile mantaining all the advantages of a plane waves\nbasis set. We already applied US-PPs to several electronic structure and nanowire problems [18]. Recently,\nChoi and Ihm [19] presented a method based on plane\nwaves to solve the tip-nanocontact-tip electron scattering problem in real atomic contacts and calculate from\nthat the ballistic conductance of open quantum systems\nvia the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker formula. Their approach was\noriginally formulated with norm-conserving (NC-PPs)\nKleinman-Bylander-type pseudo-potentials; but that is\nnot very suitable for the localized d electrons. In the\npresent paper a generalization of this method to US-PPs\nis presented. As we shall show, it turns out that the\nsolution of the scattering problem is not more difficult\nwith US-PPs than with NC-PPs, while the calculation\nof the transmission coefficient requires a generalization\nof the expression for the probability current carried by\n\n\f2\na propagating state, which is put forward in this paper.\nThe extra workload introduced by the US-PPs is in fact\nnegligible. Noting that a method of Thygesen et al. [9],\nformulated with a wavelet basis set, is also able to deal\nwith US-PPs, we will in Sec. IIIA compare our results\nwith those of Ref.[9] in the specific example of an infinite\nmonatomic Al wire with an H atom adsorbed on the side.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe a scattering-based approach for conductance calculation with ultrasoft pseudo-potentials extending Choi\nand Ihm's method. In Sec. III we present some test calculations and apply our approach to study electron conduction in monatomic magnetic nanowires. A summary\ndiscussion is given in Sec. IV.\n\nII. METHOD\n\nWe study electron transport in an open quantum system consisting of a scattering region (0 < z < L) attached to the left (z < 0) and to the right (z > L) to\nsemi-infinite generic electrodes. We assume that the electrons move ballistically in the self-consistent potential\nwith reflection and transmission restricted to the scattering region. The self-consistent potential is obtained\nperforming ground state density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations with a supercell containing the scattering region and some portion of left and right electrodes. In\nthe xy plane the system is repeated periodically and in\nthis plane the scattering states propagating at the energy E have the Bloch form and can be classified with a\nk\u22a5 index. Different k\u22a5 do not mix and can be treated\nseparately. Furthermore we consider sufficiently large supercells in the xy plane and limit the calculation to the\ntwo-dimensional \u0393 point, k\u22a5 = 0. The magnetic properties of the system are treated within the local spindensity approximation (LSDA). Therefore electrons with\ndifferent spin polarization move independently in different self-consistent potentials and the scattering problem\nis solved separately for the two spin directions. Therefore\nwe will from now on solve the problem at some fixed k\u22a5\nand spin index. Our approach and calculations will neglect all spin fluctuations, of either quantum or thermal\norigin, assuming a statically spin polarized state of the\nnanocontact.\nWe describe transition metals atoms such as Co and\nNi by ultrasoft pseudopotentials (US-PPs) [17]. In that\nscheme the scattering state \u03a8 at the energy E is a solution of single-particle Kohn-Sham equation [20] (atomic\nunits ~ = 2m = 1, e2 = 2 are used):\ni\nh\nE \u015c|\u03a8i = \u2212\u22072 + Veff + V\u0302N L |\u03a8i,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Veff is the effective local potential (see Refs.[17,\n\n20]) and V\u0302N L is the nonlocal part of US-PP:\nX\nI\nI\nV\u0302N L =\nDmn\n|\u03b2m\nih\u03b2nI |,\n\n(2)\n\nImn\n\nI\nconstructed using the set of projector functions \u03b2m\nasI\nsociated with atom I. The functions \u03b2m are localized\nwithin spheres of radius rc centered at the atom I. The\nI\ncoefficients Dmn\ncharacterize the US-PP and depend also\non the effective potential Veff [20]. The main difference\nwith respect to NC-PPs is the appearance in the lhs of\nEq.(1) of the overlap operator:\nX\nI\nI\n\u015c = 1 +\n|\u03b2m\nih\u03b2nI |\n(3)\nqmn\nmn\n\nas a consequence of the relaxation of norm-conserving\nI\ncondition. Here the coefficients qmn\nare the integrals\nof the augmentation functions defined in Refs. [17, 20].\nSince the energy E is a fixed input parameter one can\nrewrite the Eq.(1) as following:\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\nI\nI\nE\u03a8(r) = \u2212\u22072 + Veff \u03a8(r)+\nD\u0303mn\nh\u03b2nI |\u03a8i\u03b2m\n(r\u2212RI )\nImn\n\n(4)\nI\nI\nI\n, thus recovering a form similar\n\u2212 Eqmn\n= Dmn\nwith D\u0303mn\nto the case of NC-PPs.\nAs mentioned above, due to the translational symmetry the scattering states have the usual Bloch form in the\nxy plane:\n\u03a8(r\u22a5 + R\u22a5 , z) = eik\u22a5 R\u22a5 \u03a8(r\u22a5 , z),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere R\u22a5 are the lateral supercell lattice vectors.\nA. Electrode region\n\nDeep within the two electrodes (z < 0, z > L) the\nscattering state \u03a8 originating from the rightward propagating Bloch wave \u03c8j of the left electrode has an asymptotic form:\n\uf8f1\nP\nrij \u03c8i ,\nz<0\n\uf8f2 \u03c8j +\nP i\u2208L\n(6)\n\u03a8=\ntij \u03c8i ,\nz>L\n\uf8f3\ni\u2208R\n\nwhere summation over i \u2208 L (i \u2208 R) includes the generalized Bloch states in the left (right) electrode at the\nenergy E which propagate or decay to the left (right).\nThe generalized Bloch states (both propagating and decaying) constitute the so-called complex band structure\nof a solid [19]. They have the same Bloch form (5) in the\nxy plane while along the z axis, where the translational\nsymmetry is absent, they satisfy a condition:\n\u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z + d) = eikd \u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k is in general a complex number and d is the length\nof the unit cell in the z direction of the corresponding\n\n\f3\nbulk crystal. The wave functions \u03c8j with Imk = 0 and\nImk 6= 0 describe propagating and decaying (or growing)\nstates, respectively. In the bulk, only the former are of\ncourse eigenstates.\nInside the unit cell of the electrode z0 < z < z0 + d the\ngeneral solution of the integro-differential Eq.(4) can be\nwritten as a linear combination [19]:\nX\nX\n\u03c8j (r) =\ncn,j \u03c6n (r) +\ncIm,j \u03c6Im (r).\n(8)\nn\n\nIm\n\nHere \u03c6n are linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE\u03c6n (r) = \u2212\u22072 + Veff (r) \u03c6n (r),\n(9)\n\nand \u03c6Im is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous\nequation:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE\u03c6Im (r) = \u2212\u22072 + Veff (r) \u03c6Im (r)\nX\nI\n+\neik\u22a5 R\u22a5 \u03b2m\n(r \u2212 \u03c4 I \u2212 R\u22a5 ), (10)\nR\u22a5\n\n\u03c4I\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the vector-position of the I-th atom in the\nunit cell. Both \u03c6n and \u03c6Im are (x, y) periodic as in\nEq. (5) and the summation over Im in Eq. (8) involves all\nthe projectors in the unit cell. We calculate the functions\n\u03c6n and \u03c6Im following the method described in Ref.[19].\nThe function (8) is the solution of Eq.(4) if the coefficients cIm,j are given by:\nX\nI\ncIm,j =\nD\u0303mn\nh\u03b2nI |\u03c8j i.\n(11)\nn\n\nThe allowed values of k for a given energy E can be\ndetermined by imposing Eq.(7) along z to the function\n\u03c8j and to its z-derivative:\n\u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z0 + d) = eikd \u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z0 ),\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c8j\u2032 (r\u22a5 , z0 + d) = eikd \u03c8j\u2032 (r\u22a5 , z0 ).\n\n(13)\n\nInserting Eq. (8) into Eqs. (11)-(13) one can show that\nthe last three equations are equivalent to the generalized\neigenvalue problem:\nAX = eikd BX.\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the functions \u03c6n and \u03c6Im are the solutions of\nEqs.(9,10) in the region 0 < z < L and the summation\nover Im involves all the projectors within the scattering\nregion. The scattering state \u03a8 is completely determined\nby coefficients {cn , cIm , rij , tij }. The coefficients cIm are\nnow determined by:\nX\nI\ncIm =\nD\u0303mn\nh\u03b2nI |\u03a8i\n(16)\nn\n\nThere is one more set of equations on cIm for the nonlocal spheres intersecting the boundaries of the scattering\nregion and thus shared with the electrodes. One has:\nX\nX\nI\nrij cIm,i =\nh\u03b2nI |\u03a8i = cIm\n(17)\nD\u0303mn\ncIm,j +\nn\n\ni\n\nfor spheres intersecting the plane z = 0 and\nX\nX\nI\ntij cIm,i =\nD\u0303mn\nh\u03b2nI |\u03a8i = cIm\n\n(18)\n\nn\n\ni\n\nfor spheres intersecting the plane z = L. Eqs.(16)-(18)\ntogether with the usual matching conditions on the wave\nfunction and its z-derivative on the boundary planes\nz = 0 and z = L give a set of linear algebraic equations.\nSolving this set one obtains the unknown coefficients\n{cn , cIm , rij , tij }. The accuracy of the matching procedure described above was tested on various systems having no scattering region (e.g., infinite monatomic wires).\nIn such systems different propagating modes do not mix\nand must have unit transmission probability (tij = \u03b4ij ).\nWe found this condition to be satisfied with a very high\naccuracy (|tij \u2212 \u03b4ij | \u223c 10\u22126 ).\nC. Conductance calculation\n\nThe ballistic conductance G in the linear regime (infinitely small applied voltage) is related to the total transmission T at the Fermi energy by the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker\nformula G = G0 T , where G0 = e2 /h is the conductance\nquantum per spin. The total transmission is given by:\nX\n|Tij |2 = Tr[T+ T],\n(19)\nT =\nij\n\nwhere A and B are matrices. We solve this problem\nto obtain ino general a complex k and coefficients X =\nn\ncn,j , cIm,j determining the generalized Bloch state \u03c8j\nat a given energy E and k\u22a5 .\nB. Scattering region\n\nInside the scattering region (0 < z < L) the scattering\nstate \u03a8 can be represented in a form similar to Eq.(8):\nX\nX\n\u03a8(r) =\ncn \u03c6n (r) +\ncIm \u03c6Im (r),\n(15)\nn\n\nIm\n\nwhere T is thepmatrix of normalized transmission amplitudes Tij = Ii /Ij * tij and Ij is the probability current of the Bloch state \u03c8j in the z direction. Note that\nonly rightward propagating states in both left and right\nelectrodes should be considered so the matrix T is of dimensions MR \u00d7 ML where ML and MR are the number\nof propagating modes in the left and right electrodes, respectively. The sum over i, j is over the states of both\nspin polarizations present at the chosen energy. In our\nLSDA scheme the two spin channels are decoupled, and\ntherefore the Tij is nonvanishing only if i and j have the\nsame spin. No spin flip is allowed in our calculation.\n\n\f4\nThe eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix T+ T determine the coefficients of a unitary transformation from\nthe set of Bloch states \u03c8j to the conductance eigenchannels [21]. In the eigenchannel basis the matrix T+ T is\ndiagonal. Calling Ti the eigenvalues, the conductance is\na sum of independent contributions from each eigenchannel:\nX\nTi ,\n(20)\nG = G0\ni\n\nwhere Ti gives the transmission probability for i-th eigenchannel.\nIn order to calculate the total transmission T one needs\nto know the current Ij carried by the propagating Bloch\nstate \u03c8j in the z direction. The \u03c8j are actually pseudowave functions, and coincide with the all-electron wave\nfunctions only outside the core regions. Therefore the\nusual expression for the current flowing through a plane\nS perpendicular to the z axis and located at z0 :\n#\n\"Z\n\u2202\u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z)\n0\n2\n\u2217\n(21)\nIj = 2Im\nd r\u22a5\n\u03c8j (r\u22a5 , z0 )\n\u2202z\nS\nz=z0\nis valid only when the plane z0 does not intersect the\nnonlocal spheres. At a general point it must be modified\nas:\n\u0014X\n0\nI\nIj = Ij \u2212 2Im\nD\u0303mn\nh\u03b2nI |\u03c8j i \u00d7\nImn\n\nZ\n\nz0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\nS\n\nI\n\u03b2m\n(r\n\n\u2212\n\nRI )\u03c8j\u2217 (r)d2 r\u22a5\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nThis expression has been derived by requiring the two\nfollowing properties. First, the term added to Ij0 guarantees that Ij does not depend on z0 once the wave function \u03c8j satisfies Eq.(4) and has the Bloch form in the xy\nplane. Second, at all z0 where the plane S does not intersect the nonlocal spheres this additional term vanishes\nso that Ij = Ij0 . The accuracy of the current calculation\nwith Eq.(22) was tested by checking the unitarity of the\nscattering matrix which is a consequence of current conservation.PFor each propagating state \u03c8j one must have\nP\ni Rij = 1, where Tij and Rij are the normali Tij +\nized transmission and reflection coefficients, respectively.\nAgain, this condition was found to be satisfied with very\nhigh accuracy for all the systems considered so far.\nWe point out that Eq.(19) assumes that the current\noperator is diagonal in the basis of Bloch states. That is\nnot always true. A mixing might occur between degenerate states with the same k in z direction (for example,\nstates derived from atomic px , py or dxz , dyz levels if the\nsystem has an axial symmetry around z axis). Therefore we must orthogonalize Bloch states with respect to\nthe current operator before applying Eq.(19) for the total\ntransmission calculation. The general off-diagonal matrix\n\nelements Ijk of the current operator are given by:\nX\n0\nI\nIjk = Ijk\n+i\nD\u0303mn\n\u00d7\n\u0014\n\nImn\nz0\n\nh\u03b2nI |\u03c8k i\n\nZ\n\nh\u03b2nI |\u03c8j i\u2217\n\n\u2212\u221e\nZ z0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\nI\n\u03b2m\n(r \u2212 \u03c4 I )\u03c8j\u2217 (r)d2 r\u22a5 \u2212 (23)\n\u0015\nZ\nI\nI \u2217\n2\ndz [\u03b2m (r \u2212 \u03c4 )] \u03c8k (r)d r\u22a5 ,\n\ndz\n\nS\n\nS\n\nwhere\n0\nIjk\n= \u2212i\n\nZ \u0014\n\u2202\u03c8k (r\u22a5 , z)\n\u03c8j\u2217 (r\u22a5 , z0 )\n\u2202z\nS\n\u2202\u03c8j\u2217 (r\u22a5 , z)\n\u2202z\n\nz=z0\n\n\u2212\n\n(24)\n\nz=z0\n\n\u0015\n\u03c8k (r\u22a5 , z0 ) d2 r\u22a5 .\n\nThe ballistic conductance is calculated in three steps.\nFirst, we perform the supercell DFT electronic structure\ncalculation with the plane-wave code (PWscf) [22] to obtain the self-consistent potential Veff and the screened\nI\ncoefficients Dmn\n. For spin-polarized systems both Veff\nI\nand Dmn will depend on the spin polarization. Second,\nwe calculate the complex band structures of the infinite\nleft and right electrodes and orthogonalize the propagating Bloch states with respect to the current operator\nusing Eq.(23). The unit cells of the electrodes are chosen within the supercell, beyond the scattering region,\nwhere the potential is bulk-like. Finally, we calculate the\ntransmission coefficients tij for each rightward propagating state \u03c8j of the left electrode and obtain the total\ntransmission T and eigenchannel transmissions Ti as described above. This procedure now represents a rigorous\nextension of Choi and Ihm's method to US-PPs.\nIII. TEST CASES AND APPLICATION TO\nMONATOMIC MAGNETIC NANOWIRES\n\nWe apply now the above scheme to calculate the ballistic conductance for two test systems: a) a monatomic\nAl wire with an H impurity; b) carbon chains between Al\nelectrodes with a finite cross-section. The conductance\nof these systems has been calculated by other methods\nand we can compare our results with the known data. As\nour main application, we study the effect of the magnetization reversal on electron transport in monatomic Co\nand Ni nanowires (a case of ballistic magnetoresistance).\nA. Monatomic Al wire with an H impurity\n\nWe present first the conductance of a monatomic Al\nwire with an H atom adsorbed on the side and compare our result with the wavelet basis set calculations\nof Ref.[9]. The supercell for electronic structure calculation along with its division onto the bulk-like part (used\n\n\f5\nunit cell\n\nscattering region\n\nH\n\nSlight differences of transmission will also be related to\nthe optimized atomic positions, presumably slightly different in our calculations and in those of Ref.[9].\n\nB.

The corresponding result of\nRef. [9] and the transmission coefficient of the perfect infinite\nwire are shown by a dotted and a dashed line, respectively.\n\nfor complex band structure calculations) and the scattering region are shown in Fig. 1. The LDA calculations\nwere performed using the Perdew-Zunger parametrization [24] of exchange-correlation energy. The hydrogen\natom was described by US-PP with the parameters given\nin Ref.[18]. Energy cutoffs of 25 and 250 Ry were used\nfor the wave functions and for the charge density, respectively. The BZ was sampled by three special k-points.\nThe spacing between Al atoms was 2.39 \u00c5 while the wires\nwere separated by |R\u22a5 | = 7.5 \u00c5. As in Ref.[9] the positions of the adsorbate and of the two nearest Al atoms\nwere optimized while the other Al atoms in the supercell\nwere kept at the positions corresponding to the perfect\ninfinite wire. The relaxed Al-H distance was found to be\n1.82 \u00c5 with the Al-H-Al angle of 79.1o .\nIn Fig. 1 one can see that the calculated transmission\ncurve (solid line) is very similar to that of Ref.[9] (dotted\nline). We recover the main features found in Ref.[9]: a)\nthe adsorption of H atom reduces the transmission coefficient by a factor approximately 0.5 with respect to the\ntransmission coefficient of the perfect infinite wire (which\nis merely determined by the number of propagating states\nat a given energy and is shown by a dashed line in the figure); b) the drop of the transmission to zero at an energy\nabout \u22122.0 eV. We note a small difference in the positions\nof the edges of transmission curves in two calculations\n(see, for instance, the low maximum at about \u22121.5 eV)\nwhich is a consequence of slightly different band structures of the bulk-like Al wires. A shift of the energy band\nleads to a corresponding shift of the transmission curve.\n\nAs a second example we consider carbon chains attached to Al electrodes of finite cross-sections. The electron conduction in such systems has been recently calculated using methods based on a localized basis set [6, 7].\nThe system consists of a finite length carbon chain placed\nbetween two Al electrodes of finite cross section oriented\nalong Al(100) direction (see Fig. 2). The carbon atoms\nare described by US-PPs with the parameters of Ref.[18].\nAs in the previous case, the energy cutoffs of 25 and 250\nRy were used for the wave functions and for the charge\ndensity, respectively, and the BZ was sampled by three\nspecial k-points. The size of the supercell in the xy plane\nwas chosen to be Lx = Ly = 12.15 \u00c5. The electrode unit\ncell is composed of two layers and contains nine atoms.\nThe carbon atoms in the chain are separated by 2.5 a.u.\nThe carbon chain ends are positioned in the hollow sites\nof the Al(110) electrode sufaces, the electrode-chain distance denoted as D.\nWe considered seven-atom (with D = 1.0 \u00c5) and fouratom (with D = 1.9 \u00c5) carbon chains previously studied\nwith a localized basis set in Ref.[6] and Ref.[7], respectively. Transmission coefficients calculated for these sysscattering region\nunit cell\nD\n\nthis calculation\nlocalized basis set calculation\n\nFIG. 2: Transmission coefficient for the seven-atom carbon\nchain between two finite cross-section Al electrodes with the\nelectrode-chain separation D = 1.0 \u00c5.

The dashed\nline shows the corresponding result obtained with a localized\nbasis set [7].\n\ntems are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. Our transmission\ncurves (solid lines) show qualitatively the same behaviour\nas the corresponding curves of Refs.[6],[7] (dashed lines).\nBroad maxima in the transmission coefficient are related\nto the energy position of the carbon \u03c0 states while the energy windows with vanishing transmission (e.g., energy\nintervals [\u22121.75, \u22121.5] and [0.7,1.2]) correspond to gap\nenergies where no coupling exists between carbon chain\nand electrode states. We note some small discrepancies\nbetween the present plane waves calculation and the localized basis set calculations, mainly concerning the positions of the edges of transmission curves. For example,\nour calculations give zero transmission coefficient in the\nenergy window [\u22121.75, \u22121.5] to be compared with the energy interval [\u22121.9, \u22121.7] of Ref.[6]. As before, the shifts\nof transmission curves appear to be related to slight differences in the band structures of the electrodes obtained\nusing two different basis sets.\nC. Monatomic magnetic nanowires\n\nWe now apply the method to calculate the ballistic\nconductance of monatomic Co and Ni nanowires with\na single spin reversal. We discuss first the electronic\nand geometrical structure of an infinite monatomic Co\nwire without spin reversal [23]. Similar results for the Ni\nnanowire were reported in Ref. 26. The total energy and\nthe magnetic moment of the Co wire as a function of the\ninteratomic spacing are shown in the insets of Fig.4. The\nground state of the wire is ferromagnetic with an energy\ngain of about 0.41 eV/atom with respect to the nonmag-\n\nnetic wire. The equilibrium interatomic distance for the\nCo wire (about a = 2.11 \u00c5) is similar to that of the Ni\nwire [26] while the magnetic moment is more than twice\n(\u03bc = 2.16 \u03bcB /atom compared to 1.11 \u03bcB /atom for the Ni\nwire). Similar to the Ni wire [26] the magnetic moment\nof the Co wire vanishes and the wire turns nonmagnetic\nin the unphysical region where the interatomic distance\nis taken less than approximately 1.6 \u00c5 (1.9 \u00c5 for Ni).\nFor a perfect infinite monatomic wire the number of\nconducting channels is just the number N of bands crossing the Fermi level. Since in the absence of tip-wire junction each channel has a unit transmission probability the\nballistic conductance as given by the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker\nformula is G = G0 N . In Fig.4 we show the complex\nband structure of a monatomic Co wire obtained at the\nequilibrium interatomic spacing - an ingredient that will\nbe needed for further conductance calculation. Complex bands for the majority (spin up) and minority (spin\ndown) spin polarizations are displayed in Figs. 4a and 4b\nrespectively. Qualitatively, the complex bands of the Co\nwire look quite similar to those for a Ni wire [27] though\nthe exchange splitting is twice as large (approximately\n2 eV versus 1 eV for the Ni wire) which is directly related to a stronger Hund's rule coupling and a higher\nmagnetic moment per atom of the Co wire. As for the\nnumber of conductance channels, from the figure one can\ncount one spin up and six spin down (real) bands crossing the Fermi level, giving altogether seven propagating\nchannels. The same result was previously found for the\nNi wire. [26, 27] Not surprisingly, this overall number\nof channels is much larger than any of the observed experimental conductance steps, of both nickel and cobalt\nnanocontacts [2, 3, 4, 5].\nWe consider now a monatomic nanowire with positive magnetization as our left electrode, and another\nwith negative magnetization as our right electrode, the\nnanocontact thus consisting of a magnetization reversal.\nWe obtain the optimal shape of magnetization reversal\nby LSDA calculations, minimizing the total energy of a\nsupercell containing 12 atoms. The detailed shape of the\noptimal magnetization reversal was obtained by allowing magnetization to vary freely in magnitude and sign,\nwhile constraining the overall total magnetic moment to\nbe zero (for computational details see Ref. 26). The resulting spin reversal turned out to be quite sharp and the\nground state had, roughly speaking, 6 atoms with positive and 6 atoms with negative magnetization (see Fig. 5)\nWhile this way to build a collinear magnetization reversal would be of course incorrect for a bulk Bloch wall,\nit may not be an unreasonable description of magnetization reversal inside a very short nanocontact. Bruno\n[28] showed that the width of a nanoconstrained magnetic domain wall is essentially determined by the size\nof the constriction and can thus be much smaller than\nthe (noncollinear) Bloch wall in 3D crystals or N\u00e9el walls\nin a film.

Real\nbands, complex bands with Re k = 0, and \u03c0/a are plotted in the middle, left, and right panels, respectively. Each band is\nlabeled by its main atomic character. The total energy and the magnetic moment per atom as a function of interatomic spacing\nare shown on the left and right insets, respectively.\n\nsystem, the domain wall spin rotation must take place in\nsuch small distance to justify a spin collinear approximation.\nThe self-consistent potential for the nanowire with a\nspin reversal is subsequently used to solve the scattering\nproblem. The scattering region and the unit cell of the\nleft and right side of the wire are shown in Fig. 6. For\nsymmetry reasons the total transmission is the same for\nelectrons of both spin directions (this conclusion has also\nbeen checked numerically). Therefore we choose to consider only electrons with spin down polarization incident\nfrom the left on the spin reversal region.\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFIG. 5: Planar average of the magnetization along the Co\nnanowire.\n\nIn Fig. 6a we present the total transmission (for one\nspin channel) and the contributions from each band as\na function of energy for the Co wire with a spin reversal. The propagating state in the left half of wire can\npropagate through the spin reversal and contribute to\nthe total transmission only if it can be matched with an\nappropriate propagating state to the right. For example, at the Fermi energy there are 6 propagating states\nin the left side. However, only s \u2212 dz2 and dz2 \u2212 s states\nhave nonzero transmission since there is only one dz2 \u2212 s\npropagating 1state in the right side. The d states in particular can be matched only with decaying states in the\nright side and are therefore completely\nreflected due to\n1\nthe spin reversal. At energy about E = EF \u2212 0.4 eV\nthe two dxz,yz states start contributing to the transmission because there appear two states of the same symmetry in the right side of the wire. On the contrary, the\ndxy,x2 \u2212y2 states cannot get through the spin reversal at\nany energy and never contribute to conductance. Fig. 6b\nshows the eigenchannel\ntransmissions Ti . The s \u2212 dz2\n1\n1\nand dz2 \u2212 s states are combined to form a single perfectly propagating conductance eigenchannel (essentially\ns like). Another channel (mostly dz2 ), orthogonal to the\nfirst one, appears at energy about 0.6 eV below the Fermi\nenergy. It is quite narrow and has a smaller transmission probability (about 0.6 at the maximum). The two\n1\ndxz,yz states form two eigenchannels of the same symmetry. They contribute to the total transmission between\n0.4 eV and 1.8 eV below the Fermi energy and are partially reflected (the transmission probability is about 0.8\n\n\f8\nscattering region\nunit cell of the right wire\n\ndown\n\n...\n\n...\n\nunit cell of the left wire\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nCo\n\nCo\n\nNi\n\nT\n\nNi\n\ndz2\ndxz;yz\n\nE EF\n\ns\n\ns\ndz 2\n\n(eV)\n\ns\ndxz;yz\n\nE EF\n\ndz 2\n\ndz2\n\ns\n\n(eV)\n\nFIG. 6: Transmission coefficients for spin down electron incident from the left on a magnetization reversal in a monatomic\nCo nanowire: a) total transmission (solid curve) and contributions from each band; b) eigenchannel transmissions Ti . The\ncorresponding data for a monatomic Ni nanowire are shown on the insets. The bands and conductance channels are labeled by\ntheir main atomic character. The Fermi energy is chosen to be zero (dashed vertical lines).\n\nat the maximum).\nIn the left and right insets of Fig. 6 we show the total transmission (for one spin channel) and eigenchannel\ntransmissions, respectively, similarly calculated for a Ni\nnanowire with a spin reversal. One can see that again\nthere is a single conductance channel perfectly propagating at all the energies studied contributing one conductance quantum (per spin) to the total conductance\nat the Fermi energy. However, the contribution from\nother d channels at lower energies is now much larger\n(at the maxima these channels have almost unit transmission probabilities). This seems reasonable since the\nCo atoms in the wire have a larger exchange splitting,\nand are therefore more reflecting, compared to the Ni\natoms (as discussed above).\nAdding the transmission of the two spin channels at\nthe Fermi energy we get the overall value of G0 + G0 for\nthe conductance. This is to be compared with G0 + 6G0\nof the ferromagnetic wire. Such a large difference between conductances of uniform ferromagnetic wire and\nthe same ferromagnetic wire with a spin reversal is an example of magnetoresistance, analogous to that discussed\nearlier.[29] Note that the minimal conductance value 2G0\nobtained in presence of spin reversal is still larger than\n\nthat of \"fractional peak\" at approximately G0 reported\nfor Co and Ni nanowires [4]. We should stress, however, that the exact equivalence of the s channels for\nthe two spin polarizations, leading to the factor two in\nour result, is only valid for our chosen spin-symmetric\ngeometry. The investigation of more complex magnetic\nand structural geometries which might have lower conductance values will be the subject of future work. The\nrole of fluctuations should also be considered, as they are\nlikely to be important in a nanomagnetic system, particularly at high temperature.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have generalized to magnetic transition metals\nthe approach of Choi and Ihm for calculating the ballistic conductance of an open quantum system. The\nmethod has been implemented with ultrasoft pseudopotentials and plane wave basis set in a DFT-LSDA abinitio scheme. After checking the results against previous calculations based on different methods, we applied our method to calculate the ballistic conductance\nof monatomic Co and Ni nanowires with a single spin re-\n\n\f9\nversal. The s-like channel has a unit transmission probability at all energies for both Co and Ni nanowires. On\nthe contrary, the transmission probability of the heavy d\nelectrons is heavily influenced by the spin reversal. For\nboth wires we found that at the Fermi energy there is\nonly one conductance channel per spin (s like) while all\nd electron ballistic conductance is completely blocked by\nthe spin reversal, as was previously guessed from band\nstructure calculations [26]. In the energy window between 0.4 eV and 1.8 eV below the Fermi level the d\nelectron conductance is smaller for the Co wire, due to\nan exchange splitting almost twice as large as that of\nthe Ni wire. No structural distortions of linear chains\n(like zigzag structures or dimerizations) were considered\nin this paper, as they are not likely to be relevant in the\nshort nanocontact connecting the two tips. More efforts\nto reproduce the realistic geometries of the nanocontacts\nwill form the subject of future work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partly sponsored by MIUR COFIN03\nand FIRB RBAU01LXSH and FIRB RBAU017S8R, by\nINFM (section F, G, \"Iniziativa Trasversale calcolo parallelo\"), and by EU Contract ERBFMRXCT970155 (FULPROP).

The core radii (in a.u.) of Co pseudo-potential are:\nrsc = (2.0, 2.2), rpc = (2.2, 2.3), rdc = (1.6, 2.2). The kinetic\nenergy cut-offs of the plane wave basis set were 25 Ry and\n300 Ry for the wave functions and the charge density, respectively. k-point sampling is done with a uniform mesh\nof 40 k-points in the 1D BZ zone. The integration up to the\nFermi level was done by a standard broadening technique\n[25] with the smearing parameter of 0.005 Ry.\n[24] J.P. Perdew and A. Zunger, Phys. Rev.
