Critical\nN = 2 strings have a four-dimensional target space. The supersymmetric structure implies that\nthe target space has a complex structure. Therefore it must be of signature (4, 0) or (2, 2). In\n(4, 0) signature there are no propagating degrees of freedom in the N = 2 string spectrum. In\n(2, 2) signature there are only massless scalars in the spectrum and the infinite tower of massive\nexcitations of the string is absent.\nIn [3] the N = 2 closed strings have been divided into two families denoted by \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nConsider N = 2 strings in a flat background. In order to construct the N = 2 string we need to\ngauge the N = 2 superconformal algebra (SCA) on the worldsheet. More precisely we have two\ncopies of the N = 2 algebra to consider: the left and right sectors. The free field representation\nof the (left) N = 2 SCA takes the form\n\u0001\n1\n1\nT = \u2212 \u03b7IJ \u2202xI \u2202xJ \u2212 \u03b7IJ \u2202\u03c8 I \u03c8 J + \u2202\u03c8 J \u03c8 I ,\n2\n4\ni L I J\nJ = JIJ \u03c8 \u03c8 ,\n2\n\u0001 I J\ni\nL\n\u03b7IJ \u00b1 iJIJ\n\u03c8 \u2202x .\n(1.1)\nG\u00b1 =\n2\nHere I, J = 1, ..., 4 denote the indices of the target space in a real basis. The metric is given\nL\nby \u03b7IJ = diag(\u22121, \u22121, +1, +1). JIJ\nis a K\u00e4hler form related to the complex structure J KJ by\nJIJ = \u03b7IK J KJ , and the index L refers to the left sector. Similarly, we have the SCA generators\nin the right sector with a complex structure J R . The N = 2 string denoted by \u03b2-string in [3] is\ndefined by having the same complex structure in the left and right sectors J L = J R . The N = 2\nstring denoted as \u03b1-string in [3] has different (inequivalent) complex structures in the left and\nright sectors.\nThe \u03b2- and \u03b1-strings define two families of N = 2 strings related by T-duality [3]. In (2, 2)\nsignature both families have one scalar in the spectrum. The effective action of the \u03b2-string\nscalar has been computed in [4], which suggested its interpretation as a deformation of the target\nspace K\u00e4hler potential. The effective action of the scalar in the \u03b1-string has been computed in\n[5]. It was found that the \u03b1-string scalar is free and that the dynamics is that of a self-dual\ncurvature with torsion considered in [6].\nIn this paper we study the D-branes in both families of N = 2 strings. We will mainly consider\nthe target space with (2, 2) signature. The extension to (4, 0) signature is straightforward. We will\nconsider two types of N = 2 boundary conditions, A-type and B-type [7, 3]. We will compute\nopen and closed string scattering amplitudes in the presence of the D-branes and discuss the\n1\n\n\fresults. We find that, except the space filling D-branes, the B-type D-branes decouple from the\nbulk: the perturbative closed string scattering amplitudes off B-type branes vanish. The A-type\nD-branes exhibit an inconsistency: the scattering amplitude of two closed string modes in the\nA-branes background contains an infinite number of poles that correspond to massive excitations\nof both open and closed string states. Such an observation was first made in [8].\nWe construct the D-branes effective worldvolume theories. They are given by a dimensional\nreduction of self-dual Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. They correspond to various integrable\nsystems: Bogomolny equation [9] for the three-branes, the Hitchin system [10] for the two-branes,\nNahm equations for the one-branes [11] and the ADHM equation [12] for the zero-branes. We\nconstruct the D-branes gravity backgrounds. Finally, we comment on N = 2 open/closed string\ndualities.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we consider the A-type and B-type boundary\nconditions on the N = 2 algebra. We discuss the classification of N = 2 D-branes and their geometry. In section 3 we construct vertex operators and compute open and closed string scattering\namplitudes in the presence of the D-branes. In section 4 we construct the D-branes effective\nworldvolume theories as a dimensional reduction of self-dual Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions and see the correspondence to integrable systems. In section 5 we construct the D-branes\ngravity backgrounds. In section 6 we discuss possible N = 2 open/closed string dualities.\n\n2\n\nN = 2 Boundary Conditions\n\nIn this section we consider the A-type and B-type boundary conditions on the N = 2 algebra\nand the corresponding N = 2 D-branes. We will expand the discussion of section 7 in [3].\n\n2.1\n\nClosed N = 2 Strings\n\nIn the following we will review some aspects of the complex structures on R2,2 that are relevant\nto the generators of N = 2 SCA. In the real basis xI = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ), the metric is given by\n\u03b7IJ = diag(\u22121, \u22121, +1, +1).

The B-type boundary conditions\nin the \u03b2-string correspond to even-dimensional D-branes. The analysis of [7] implies that the\nworldvolumes are holomorphic (K\u00e4hler) submanifolds of R2,2 with the complex structure J . The\nspace-time filling (2+2)-brane is the target space R2,2 itself. If we use the complex coordinates\non R2,2 z1 , z2 in (2.2), then the (2+0) and (0+2)-branes are the holomorphic 2-cycles [z1 , z2 = 0]\nand [z1 = 0, z2 ], respectively. The (0+0)-brane is a point in R2,2 .\nThe A-type boundary conditions in the \u03b2-string correspond to a (1+1)-brane. The worldvolume cycle is a special Lagrangian submanifold of R2,2 [7]. Denote the (1+1)-brane worldvolume\ncoordinates by x1 , x3 . The pull-backs of the holomorphic 2-form \u03a9 and K\u00e4hler 2-form K read\n\u03a9|worldvolume = dx1 \u2227 dx3 , K|worldvolume = 0 .\n\n(2.22)\n\nThe A and B-type boundary conditions in the \u03b1-string correspond to odd-dimensional Dbranes. We consider R2,2 as a product of two one-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifolds M1 and M2 .\nConsider the (2+1)-brane. The worldvolume is a product of a two-dimensional cycle, say M1 =\nM1 parametrized by x1 , x2 and the one-dimensional cycle M2 \u2208 M2 parametrized by x3 . We will\nnow show that M1 is a holomorphic 2-cycle and M2 is a Lagrangian submanifold with respect to\nthe complex structure J or Je. We will follow the discussion in [13].\nWe write the matrix U (2.21) as\n\nU = U+ + U\u2212 ,\n\n5\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fwhere\nU+ =\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n!\n\nU\u2212 =\n\n,\n\n0 0\n0 \u03c33\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2.24)\n\nU + defines the cycle M1 and U \u2212 defines the cycle M2 . It is easy to see that the following relations\nhold\nU + J = +J U + , U \u2212 J = \u2212J U \u2212 ,\n(2.25)\nand\nU + Je = +JeU + , U \u2212 Je = \u2212JeU \u2212 .\n\n(2.26)\n\nThese imply that M1 is a holomorphic 2-cycle and M2 is a Lagrangian submanifold with respect\nto the complex structures J or Je. The (0 + 1)-brane is a point in M1 times a Lagrangian\nsubmanifold with respect to the complex structures J or Je in M2 .\n\nConsider next the D-branes in a curved background M. The analysis of the D-branes in the\n\u03b2-string is done in [7] and the worldvolumes are holomorphic (sub)manifolds of M. Consider\nnext the \u03b1-string. The target space geometry of \u03b1-string is given by a bi-Hermitian geometry\nwith two commuting complex structures J \u00b1 that are covariantly constant with respect to the\n\u03c1\n[14, 6]. One defines the\naffine connection with a torsion \u2207\u00b1 J \u00b1 = 0 with \u0393\u00b1\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd = \u0393\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd \u2213 H\u03bc\u03bd\nprojection operator [13]\n1\n(2.27)\n\u03a0\u00b1 = (I \u00b1 \u03a0) ,\n2\nwith\n\u03a0 = J + J \u2212 , \u03a02 = 1 .\n(2.28)\nIt defines a local product structure of the target space geometry: M is locally M1 \u00d7 M2 where\nM1 and M2 are K\u00e4hler manifolds. The D-branes have a local product structure as well. The\nmatrix U can de decomposed as in (2.23) with\nU \u00b1 = \u03a0\u00b1 U\u03a0\u00b1 .\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe boundary conditions require the the solution of two independent relations in the K\u00e4hler\ngeometry of M1 and M2\nU + J+ = \u03b7J+ U + ,\n\nU \u2212 J+ = \u2212\u03b7J+ U \u2212 ,\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere \u03b7 = 1, \u22121 for the B- and A- type boundary conditions, respectively. When \u03b7 = 1 the\nbrane geometry is a local product of a holomorphic cycle in M1 and a Lagrangian cycle in M2\nwith respect to the complex structure J + . The structure is interchanged when \u03b7 = \u22121.\n6\n\n\fN = 2 Strings Scattering off D-branes\n\n3\n\nIn this section we compute string scattering amplitudes in the presence of A-type and B-type\nbranes. We will see that in the presence of A-branes the amplitudes exhibit infinite number of\nmassive poles, which do not correspond to N = 2 string states. The amplitudes in the presence\nof B-branes vanish and imply a decoupling between the open and closed string states. We note\nthat N = 2 strings scatterings in the presence of D-branes were studied in [8], before their A and\nB classification [3]. There will be some overlap between our computations and those of [8].\n\n3.1\n\nThe Vertex Operators\n\nWe start by constructing the vertex operators of the closed N = 2 string scalar \u03c6 in the different\npictures. We consider both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 strings. We analyze first the matter part of the vertex\noperators. The ghost part will be discussed later.\nThe scalar vertex operator of the matter sector part reads in the (\u22121, \u22121)-picture\n(\u22121,\u22121)\n\nVL\n\n(\u22121,\u22121)\n\n(z) = eik*XL (z) ,\n\nVR\n\n(z\u0304) = eik*XR (z\u0304) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe picture-changing operators [15] are given by the world sheet supercharges:\nG\u00b1\nL (z) =\n\n\u0001 I\ni\nL\n\u03b7IJ \u00b1 iJIJ\n\u03c8L \u2202XLJ ,\n2\n\nG\u00b1\nR (z\u0304) =\n\nUsing the OPE's of the free fields\n\n\u0001 I\ni\nR\n \u0304 J .\n\u03b7IJ \u00b1 iJIJ\n\u03c8R \u2202X\nR\n2\n\nXLI (z)XLJ (w) \u223c \u2212\u03b7 IJ log(z \u2212 w), \u03c8LI (z)\u03c8LJ (w) \u223c \u2212\none gets\n(\u22121,\u22121)\nG\u00b1\n(0)\nL (z)VL\n\nwhere\n(0,\u22121)\n\nVL\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 (0,\u22121)\n(\u22121,0)\nV\n(0), VL\n(0) ,\n\u223c\nz L\n\n1\n(z) = (kJ\u2212L \u03c8L (z)) eik*XL (z) ,\n2\n\nHere we used J\u00b1L \u2261 \u03b7 \u00b1 iJ L .

We take the open strings on the upper-half\nplane with the real axis as a boundary. The vertex operator of the open N = 2 scalar \u03c6 [16]\nreads in the (\u22121, \u22121)-picture\nVo(\u22121,\u22121) = eik*XL +ik*XR ,\n(3.10)\nwith the boundary conditions for X and \u03c8 given by\nXLI (z) = DJI XRJ (z\u0304),\n\n\u03c8LI (z) = DJI \u03c8RJ (z\u0304) at Imz = 0 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere\nD = diag(\u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1\u00b1) .\n\n(3.12)\n\nHere +, \u2212 correspond to the Neumann(N), Dirichlet(D) boundary conditions, respectively.\nIt is useful to use the doubling technique to implement the boundary conditions. We define\nI\n\nx (z) =\nI\n\n\u03a8 (z) =\n\nXLI (z),\nImz \u2265 0\nI\nJ\nDJ XR (z), Imz \u2264 0\n\u03c8LI (z),\nImz \u2265 0\nI J\nDJ \u03c8R (z), Imz \u2264 0\n\n(3.13)\n\nwith the OPE's given by\nxI (z)xJ (w) \u223c \u2212\u03b7 IJ log(z \u2212 w), \u03a8I (z)\u03a8J (w) \u223c \u2212\n\n\u03b7 IJ\n.\nz\u2212w\n\n(3.14)\n\nIn terms of these, one gets\nVo(\u22121,\u22121) = e2ik*x .\n\n(3.15)\n\nHere we used the fact that k has non-vanishing components only in the directions parallel to a\nD-brane, i.e. the N directions. Note that the matrix D is equal to U = V , satisfying the relations\nL\nDJ\u00b1R D = J\u2213(\u00b1)\n,\n\nfor the A-type (B-type) boundary conditions.\n8\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fThe picture-changing operators acting on the open string vertex operator are given by\ni\nG\u00b1 = \u03a8J\u00b1L \u2202x .\n2\n\n(3.17)\n\nThus, the open string vertex operators with various superconformal ghost numbers are identical\nto the closed string vertex operators in the left sector with k \u2192 2k:\n\u0001\nVo(\u22121,0) = kJ+L \u03a8 e2ik*x ,\n\u0001\nVo(0,\u22121) = kJ\u2212L \u03a8 e2ik*x ,\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n(3.18)\nVo(0,0) = 2 \u2212 kJ L \u2202x + kJ+L \u03a8 kJ\u2212L \u03a8 e2ik*x .\n\nNote that both \u03b1- and \u03b2-strings have the same form of the open string vertex operators except\nfor the momentum. This fact will be important when we compute the scattering amplitudes of\nopen strings on D-branes.\n\nIn the following we compute string scattering amplitudes in the presence of D-branes. The\nanalysis is similar to that of scatterings in the presence of D-branes in N = 1 superstrings (For\na review, see [17]).\n\n3.2\n\nThe Cylinder Amplitude\n\nLet us compute the one-loop amplitude of an N = 2 open string that connects two flat parallel\nDp-branes (p refers to the number of both space- and time-like directions). This computation\ncontains the information about the force between the D-branes [18]. As expected, we will obtain\na non-vanishing force that is mediated by the closed string scalar \u03c6. The D-branes of N = 2\nstrings do not posses RR charge and are not BPS objects.\nThe amplitude is defined by\nA=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n2t\n\nZ\n\ndu d\u016b tr\u03c6 e\u22122\u03c0tL0 e2\u03c0i\u03b8J0\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\n(3.19)\n\nt is the modulus of a cylinder that corresponds to its radius. u = \u03c6 + it\u03b8 denotes the N = 2 U(1)\nmoduli. L0 , J0 are the zero modes of the Virasoro generators and the N = 2 U(1) current. tr\u03c6\nis a summation over worldsheet fermionic modes \u03c8n , n \u2208 Z + \u03c6. L0 takes the form\nL0 = \u03b1\u2032 p2k +\n\nr2\n+N ,\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere pk is the momentum along the D-branes worldvolume, r is the distance between the Dbranes and N is the oscillation number. As in the closed string case [4], all the massive excitations\ndo not contribute to the amplitude due to a cancellation between the matter and ghosts sectors.\n9\n\n\fWe obtain\nA = Vp\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n= 2\u03c0Vp\n\n\u0001\u2212p/2 \u2212 tr2\ndt 8\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 t\ne 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\u00011\u2212p\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032\nG4\u2212p (r) .\n\n(3.21)\n\nVp is the volume of the Dp-branes worldvolume and G4\u2212p is the harmonic function in a flat R4\u2212p\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 p\u22124\n2 \u2212 p p\u22122\nG4\u2212p (r) = \u03c0 2 \u0393\nr\n.\n(3.22)\n4\n2\nThe effective action of \u03b2-string is the Plebanski action [4] and that of \u03b1-string is a free real\nscalar action [5]. By adding an interaction term to Dp-branes we have\nZ\nZ\n1\n4\n2\n(3.23)\nS = 2 d x (\u2202\u03c6) + \u03bcp dp x \u03c6 ,\n2\u03ba\nwhere we omitted the cubic interaction of the \u03b2-string effective action. Note that \u03c6 has dimension\nof length squared, and the target space metric obtained from \u03c6 is dimensionless. Consequently\n\u03ba2 has a length dimension 6, and \u03bcp has a mass dimension p + 2. The action implies that the\namplitude A is\nA = \u03bc2p \u03ba2 Vp G4\u2212p (r) .\n(3.24)\nComparing (3.21) and (3.24) we get\n\u03bc2p =\n\n2\u03c0(4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 )1\u2212p\n.\n\u03ba2\n\n(3.25)\n\nSince the D-branes of N = 2 strings are not BPS objects there is a priori no reason to expect\nthat this result is not corrected by higher order terms. However, this may still be the case since\nmost of the higher order amplitudes of N = 2 strings vanish.\n\n3.3\n\nClosed Strings Scattering off D-branes\n\nConsider the scattering amplitudes of closed strings off a D-brane. The computation involves the\ninsertion of closed string vertex operators on a disk with the boundary conditions\nXLI (z) = DJI XRJ (z\u0304),\n\n\u03c8LI (z) = DJI \u03c8RJ (z\u0304) ,\n\n(3.26)\n\nat z = z\u0304. We use the doubling technique to implement the boundary conditions for the matter\nas well as the ghost sectors.\n10\n\n\fWe will use in the sequel the following formula for the ghost and bosonized superconformal\nghosts correlators\nD\n3.3.1\n\nhc(z1 )c(z2 )c(z3 )i = (z1 \u2212 z2 )(z2 \u2212 z3 )(z1 \u2212 z3 ),\nE\n1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n.\ne\u2212\u03c6 (z1 ) e\u2212\u03c6 (z2 ) =\nz1 \u2212 z2\n\n(3.27)\n\nOne Closed String\n\nHere we calculate directly the coupling of a D-brane to the closed string scalar.

Thus, G = H and I = J, implying that\nAcco = 0. Also, for (2+0)-, (0+2)-, (1+0)-, (0+1)- and (0+0)-branes the on-shell condition\nk32 = 0 means k3 = 0 and therefore Acco = 0. For (2+1)-branes, the amplitude should not have\npoles: it is found that the residues of the open and closed string massless poles take the form\nAco * Acoo and Aco * Accc respectively, which were shown to vanish. In order to see explicitly if\nunphysical massive poles disappear in the amplitude, we have to perform the integration. We\nverified that Acco = 0 at least for the case k1 * k3 = 0. We will leave it as an open problem to\nshow this for a generic value of k1 * k3 .\n\n3.6\n\nThree and Four-Point Amplitudes of Open Strings\n\nWe insert three (four) open string vertex operators on a disk with appropriate boundary conditions at the boundary. Open string vertex operators on any type of D-branes are obtained by\nsetting to zero the components of the momentum transverse to the D-branes k\u22a5 . This means\nthat the scattering amplitudes are given by setting k\u22a5 to zero in the amplitude of the space-time\nfilling (2+2)-branes [16]:\nAooo = c12 , Aoooo = 0 .\n(3.64)\n16\n\n\fThe effective action on the worldvolume of any D-brane is obtained by a dimensional reduction\nof the effective action of the (2 + 2)-brane. Using [16], we see that D-branes effective actions in\nN = 2 strings are given by a dimensional reduction of self-dual Yang-Mills theory.\nNote that apart from the space-time filling (2+2)-branes, only the B-type (2+1)-branes in \u03b1string allow non-trivial propagating degrees of freedom on the worldvolume, and the above threepoint amplitude may be non-trivial. However, it turns out to vanish for kinematical reasons. To\nsee this, we notice that an on-shell momentum on the (2+1)-brane takes (in the real basis) the\nform\nkiI = (ki cos \u03b8i , ki sin \u03b8i , ki , 0) .\n(3.65)\nIn terms of this parametrization, Aooo reads\ncij = \u2212iki kj sin(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) .\n\n(3.66)\n\nUsing the momentum conservation law, we find\ncos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) = 1 ,\n\n(3.67)\n\nand Aooo = 0 for the (2 + 1)-brane. Thus, we find that lower-dimensional D-branes in N = 2\nstrings allow no non-trivial open string scattering amplitudes.\n\n3.7\n\nSummary\n\nLet us summarize the above computations. We computed several disk amplitudes for strings in\nthe presence of A-type and B-type D-branes. We found that the one-point function of closed\nstrings is Ac = \u2212 4\u03c0i for all the D-branes. The two-point function Acc vanishes for the Btype D-branes but exhibits infinite number of massive poles for A-type D-branes, suggesting an\ninconsistency.\nWe found that for all D-branes except the (1 + 1)-brane and the space-time filling (2 + 2)brane, the open-closed amplitudes, Aco and Aooc , vanish. The disk amplitudes with two or three\nclosed strings and at least one open string vertex operators vanish for the (0 + 0)-, (2 + 0)-,\n(0 + 2)-, (1 + 0) and (0 + 1)-branes. This is due to the fact that the inserted open string vertex\noperators can be chosen to be in the (0,0)-picture, which vanish kinematically by imposing the\non-shell condition. Thus, for these D-branes all the open-closed amplitudes on a disk vanish. It\nis likely that for these cases all higher genus amplitudes vanish, since picture-changing operators\nacting on open string vertex operators always yield a vanishing operator due to the kinematics.\nFor the (2+2)-, (2+1)-, (1+2)-, (1+1)-branes, the open-closed amplitudes could be nonzero. In fact, we found that for the (1 + 1)-brane Aco = \u22122i(k1 J L k2 ), and for the (2+2)-brane\n17\n\n\fAcoo = i\u03c0c212 . However, Acco = 0 for the (2+2)-brane, giving no unphysical open and closed\nstring poles.\nWe found that for all the D-branes except the (2+2)-brane, Aooo and Aoooo vanish. The\namplitudes with more than four open string vertices and no closed string vertex operator should\nvanish too, as these are given by a dimensional reduction of the corresponding amplitudes for\nthe (2 + 2)-brane which vanish [19]. As discussed in [19], the vanishing of n-point open string\namplitudes is valid for any order of string loops. Only the space-time filling (2 + 2)-brane has a\nnon-trivial amplitude Aooo = c12 [16].\n\n4\n\nThe Effective D-branes Worldvolume Theory\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the effective action on D-branes is given by dimensional\nreduction of self-dual Yang-Mills(SDYM) theory in (2+2)-dimensions. The self-dual equation\nreads\n1\nFIJ = \u01ebIJKL F KL ,\n(4.1)\n2\nwhere\nFIJ = \u2212[DI , DJ ], DI = \u2202I \u2212 AI .\n(4.2)\nIn components,\n[D1 , D2 ] = [D3 , D4 ], [D2 , D3 ] = \u2212[D1 , D4 ], [D3 , D1 ] = \u2212[D2 , D4 ] .\n\n(4.3)\n\n(2 + 2) \u2192 (2 + 1):\nDefine A\u03bc = (A1 , A2 , A3 ), A4 = \u03c6 and regard all the fields as x4 -independent.

One gets\n[D1 , D2 ] = [\u03c63 , \u03c64 ], D2 \u03c63 = \u2212D1 \u03c64 , D1 \u03c63 = D2 \u03c64 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn terms of the complex scalar defined by \u03a6 = \u03c63 \u2212 i\u03c64 , the above equations become\ni\n[D1 , D2 ] = \u2212 [\u03a6, \u03a6\u2020 ], (D1 \u2212 iD2 )\u03a6 = 0 .\n2\n18\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fThis is the \"Hitchin\" system. Recall that if we start from SDYM in R4 of signature (4, 0), we\nend up instead of (4.6) with\ni\n[D1 , D2 ] = \u2212 [\u03a6, \u03a6\u2020 ], (D1 + iD2 )\u03a6 = 0 .\n2\n\n(4.7)\n\n(2 + 2) \u2192 (0 + 1) :\nDefine A1 = \u03c61 = \u2212\u03c61 , A2 = \u03c62 = \u2212\u03c62 , A3 = \u03c63 = +\u03c63 and regard all the fields as\nx1 , x2 , x3 -independent. One obtains\n1\nD4 \u03c6i = \u01ebijk [\u03c6j , \u03c6k ] .\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\nThis is the \"Nahm equation\". It is known that the solutions of the Nahm equation are related by\nNahm transformation to those of the Bolomolny equation. Nahm transformation is a T-duality\nthat relates (2+1)-branes with (0+1)-branes.\n(2 + 2) \u2192 (0 + 0) :\nDefine AI = \u03c6I = \u00b1\u03c6I (depending on the signature) and regard all the fields as xI independent.

A natural approach would be to use the strategy employed for N = 1 superstrings.\nThere, one considers two descriptions of D-branes: the perturbative description of D-branes as\nhyperplanes on which open strings end, and the supergravity description as solitonic solutions\nof the field equations. One then uses the decoupling limit in order to separate the open string\ndegrees of freedom from the closed string ones [20]. The decoupling limit for D-branes of N = 1\nsuperstrings is the low energy limit ls \u2192 0. One may expect that in our case such a limit is\nalready implemented since the N = 2 strings have no massive string states. Indeed, one support\nfor this seems to be the worldsheet computation of open and closed strings correlators in section\n3. The vanishing of the correlators without taking any decoupling limit indicates that at least\nperturbatively, open and closed strings decouple.\nHowever, upon taking the decoupling limit, the supergravity backgrounds of D-branes in\nN = 1 superstrings provide a solution of the low-energy N = 1 closed string equations. Here\nwe have solutions of the closed string field equations modified by a source term. Thus, without\ntaking a limit we do not have an N = 2 closed string background.\nWe may try to remove the source term by taking another limit. In this case we are back in a\nflat background without a backreaction of the D-branes. It is possible that indeed in flat space\nthe D-branes backreaction is trivial. It means that we should think about the N = 2 string as a\ntopological string with really non-trivial structure of amplitudes only in curved spaces.\nIn curved spaces one could imagine that the duality would work as in topological field theories\n[21] or the, recently discussed, c = 1 non-critical strings [22]. One would expect that the effect of\nD-branes on the curved background would be to modify some moduli of the N = 2 closed string\nbackground. Let us see how this can happen.\n\n22\n\n\fConsider, for instance, the (2 + 0) D-brane. As shown in section 4, the effective worldvolume\ntheory is the Hitchin system. Let the curved space be of the form T \u2217 \u03a3g , where \u03a3 is a genus g\nRiemann surface. When the signature is (4, 0) g = 0, 1 while when the signature is (2, 2) g \u2265 1.\nSuch (2, 2) signature solutions have been constructed in [4]. The Hitchin system in this case\nconsists of a flat U(1) connection and an harmonic one-form on \u03a3g . The harmonic one-form can\nbe viewed as an infinitesimal deformation of \u03a3g to a Riemann surface \u03a3\u2032g . One can view then\nthe effect of the D-brane as a modification of the T \u2217 \u03a3g background. The choice of a flat U(1)\nconnection can be mapped to a deformation of T \u2217 \u03a3g by tensoring the cotangent bundle by it.\nThus, one may conjecture that N = 2 closed strings on T \u2217 \u03a3g with a (2 + 0) D-brane is equivalent\nto N = 2 closed strings on the deformed T \u2217 \u03a3g .\nAnother possible approach to finding a duality could be a flop transition. This idea is an\nextension of the G2 flop [23], which was employed to explain the geometric transition [21]. Consider as before the (2+0)-branes of the \u03b2-string on T \u2217 \u03a3g , with the D-branes wrapping the base\n\u03a3g . The D-branes create a singularity of the background in their position. We can look for\na smooth background by going smoothly to a negative volume of \u03a3g . Thus, another possible\nduality is between N = 2 closed strings in the presence of D-branes and N = 2 closed strings on\nthe background after the flop transition.\nWe expect that a similar discussion applies to the other D-branes. It seems interesting to\nexplore such possible dualities by computing the topological amplitudes. The techniques of [24]\ncould be useful.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Z.
