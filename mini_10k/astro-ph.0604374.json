Introduction\nA new window to the Universe is opened by using cosmic neutrinos as probes.\nNeutrinos traverse huge amounts of matter without being absorbed. They are not\ndeflected by magnetic fields and thus point back to the source (e.g. the sources of\nthe high energy cosmic rays). Only neutrinos might reveal information about hidden\nprocesses close to the source.\nUsing different models1,2) and the observed flux of high energy cosmic rays and\ncosmic photons, the expected flux of cosmic neutrinos can be estimated. This results\nin an upper bound for the total diffuse flux of neutrinos of dN/dE\u03bd \u223c 5 * 10\u22128 E\u03bd\u22122\nGeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 , demanding very large detector mass in order to get a significant\nsignal.\nDetecting high energy cosmic neutrinos by using large volumes of water (or later\nice) as detector medium was proposed more than 40 years ago3) . Today there are\nthreeb detectors in operation: the Baikal telescope NT-200+ in the lake Baikal, the\nAMANDA telescope at the geographical South Pole and the first part of the new\nIceCube neutrino observatory at the same place.\nThe only cosmic neutrinos detected so far are low energy neutrinos from the fusion\nprocess in the Sun (< 20 MeV) and a short burst in 1987 from the supernova SN1987a\n(< 50 MeV) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. So far, no high energy cosmic neutrinos\nhave been detected.\na\nb\n\nsee http://icecube.wisc.edu/pub and doc/conferences/NOVE-06 for full list of authors\nThe ANTARES collaboration has since the conference deployed their first string\n\n\fThis paper describes the AMANDA neutrino telescope and some recent results as\nwell as the status of the construction of the new IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n1.1. Detection principle\nAMANDA and IceCube are detecting the emitted Cherenkov light from neutrino\ninteractions in the optically transparent ice at the South Pole. High energy \u03bd\u03bc produce\nmuons with a range in ice of several km (about 1 km at 200 GeV) allowing muons\ncreated far outside the instrumented detector volume to be detected. The mean angle\nbetween the incoming neutrino and the out-going muon falls approximately as E \u22120.5\nand is about 1 degree at 1 TeV.\nCharged current \u03bde and \u03bd\u03c4 (at moderate energies) and neutral current interactions\nwill produce \"cascades\" in which most of the secondary particles will interact and\nstop within a few tens of metres. To first order the Cherenkov light will look like it\nis coming from a point source inside the large detector volume. For \u03bd\u03c4 with energies\nabove several PeV the decay length of the resulting tau will be hundreds of meters,\nallowing detection of two \"cascades\" (\"double bang events\"), one from the primary\ninteraction and a second from the decay of the tau.\n2. AMANDA\nThe AMANDA telescope (figure 1) consists of 19 strings with a total of 677 optical modules. The distance between the optical modules in a string varies between\n10 m and 20 m. The main sensitive volume is situated between 1500 m and 2000\nm below the snow surface. The effective area for AMANDA is about 104 m2 for 1\nTeV muons. The optical modules are deployed in holes (about 60 cm in diameter) in\nthe ice, which have been melted by a hot water drilling system. The telescope was\ncompleted in January 2000 and is continuously taking data except for short interruptions between November and February due to service. Data were already taken\nby the partially finished AMANDA telescope using the first four and later 10 strings\n(AMANDA-B4 and AMANDA-B10). AMANDA is running in coincidence with the\nair shower detector, SPASE-II situated on the surface. SPASE-II is observing the\nelectron component of the air shower whilst AMANDA detects the muon component.\nThe muons observed inside AMANDA from coincident events with SPASE are used\nfor calibration of AMANDA as well as for composition studies of the cosmic rays.\nAMANDA is taking data with the completed detector for the seventh year. The\nAMANDA collaboration has published many results in different areas. A short sum-\n\n\fFigure 1: (Left) The AMANDA Detector. (right) a recorded upward going muon event. The size\nof the squares corresponds to recorded amplitude\n\nmary of the most recent results is given below.\n2.1. Atmospheric Neutrinos\nThe cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere produce a flux of atmospheric\nneutrinos. These are a background when searching for high energy cosmic neutrinos.\nabove 1 TeV\nThe energy dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux is about E\u03bd\u22123.7\n\u03bc\n\u22122\nand differs from the expected E\u03bd\u03bc for extra-terrestrial neutrinos. The atmospheric\nneutrinos can be used to study the efficiency of the detector. AMANDA has reported\n3329 atmospheric neutrinos from the period 2000-2003.\nAMANDA has used a regularised unfolding method to estimate the atmospheric\nneutrino energies from the observed upward going muon energies. Figure 2 (left)\nshows the preliminary atmospheric neutrino flux for AMANDA data taken during\n20004) . The maximum observed neutrino energy is about 300 TeV (about 1000 times\nhigher than available neutrino beams at FNAL or CERN). The lower energy results\nfrom Frejus5) are also shown. The dotted curves in figure 2 are the horizontal and\n\n\fFigure 2: Left: Atmospheric neutrino flux vs. neutrino energy from AMANDA and the Frejus\nexperiment 5) .

Diffuse fluxes\nNeutrinos from different cosmic sources with too few events to be detected individually will add up to a \"diffuse\" flux of cosmic neutrinos. Due to the expected harder\nenergy spectrum the signal for diffuse cosmic neutrinos will be seen as high energy\nevents above the atmospheric neutrino energy distribution. Figure 2 (left) shows a\n90 % CL upper limit of E 2 \u03a6\u03bd\u03bc < 2.6 * 10\u22127 GeV cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121 for an extraterrestrial\nflux component between 100 TeV and 300 TeV (line labeled 6 on the right). To\nE\u03bd\u22122\n\u03bc\nthe right several different limits for diffuse cosmic neutrinos (sum of all flavours) are\nshown. These are based on \u03bd\u03bc as well as cascade event (\u03bde and \u03bd\u03c4 ) analyses. The\nsingle neutrino flavour limits have been multiplied by a factor of three for neutrino\noscillations to obtain the all flavour flux at Earth. The lines labeled 7 and 8 in figure 2\n(right) are not limits but expected sensitivities since the data are still blinded.\nThe sensitivity for detecting a diffuse cosmic neutrino flux has improved by an\n\n\forder of magnitude in less than 10 years.\n2.3. Point source searches\nThe AMANDA collaboration has performed the most sensitive search for neutrino\npoint sources in the northern sky using 3329 \u03bd\u03bc events (purity about 95 %) obtained\nduring the years 2000-200310) . Figure 3 shows the directions in the northern sky\n(in celestial coordinates) and the corresponding significance map for the AMANDA\nevents. No evidence for any extraterrestrial point source is found. The highest excess\ncorresponds to a significance of about 3.4\u03c3. The probability to observe this or a\nhigher excess, taking into account trial factors, is 92 %.\n\nFigure 3: Left: sky map of the selected 3329 neutrino events collected during 2000-03. Right:\nsignificance map for the search for clusters of events in the northern hemisphere, based on the\nselected events (gray scale is in sigma).\n\nA search for 33 preselected neutrino candidate sources including galactic and\nextra-galactic sources has been done based on four years of data 10) . The result is\nshown in Table 1. The highest excess is found in the direction of the Crab Nebula,\nwith 10 observed events compared to an average of 5.4 expected background events\n(about 1.7\u03c3). Taking into account the trial factor the probability that a background\nfluctuation produces this or a larger deviation in any of the 33 search bins is 64 %, (due\nto the multiplicity of the directions examined and the correlation between overlapping\nsearch bins).\n2.4. Gamma-ray bursts\nGamma-ray bursts are candidate sources for the ultra high energy cosmic rays.\nThey are the most energetic objects in the universe and observing neutrinos in coincidence with the bursts would give evidence for the acceleration of hadrons. Due\nto the coincidence in direction and time with a GRB such a search is almost free of\nbackground from atmospheric neutrinos. The AMANDA collaboration has searched\nfor neutrinos from more than 500 GRBs without any observed signal, and derived the\n\n\fAmanda search for neutrinos\nfrom 33 preselected objects\nCandidate\n\u03b4(\u25e6 ) \u03b1(h) nobs nb \u03a6lim\nCandidate\n\u03b4(\u25e6 ) \u03b1(h) nobs\n\u03bd\nTeV Blazars\nSNR & Pulsars\n9.3 19.12 3\nMarkarian 421\n38.2 11.07 6 5.6 0.68 SGR 1900+14\nMarkarian 501\n39.8 16.90 5 5.0 0.61 Geminga\n17.9 6.57\n3\n1ES 1426+428\n42.7 14.48 4 4.3 0.54 Crab Nebula\n22.0 5.58 10\n58.8 23.39 4\n1ES 2344+514\n51.7 23.78 3 4.9 0.38 Cassiopeia A\n1ES 1959+650\n65.1 20.00 5 3.7 1.0\nGeV Blazars\nMicroquasars\nQSO 0528+134\n13.4 5.52 4 5.0 0.39 SS433\n5.0 19.20 2\nQSO 0235+164\n16.6 2.62 6 5.0 0.70 GRS 1915+105\n10.9 19.25 6\n32.9 4.36\n5\nQSO 1611+343\n34.4 16.24 5 5.2 0.56 GRO J0422+32\nQSO 1633+382\n38.2 16.59 4 5.6 0.37 Cygnus X1\n35.2 19.97 4\nQSO 0219+428\n42.9 2.38 4 4.3 0.54 LS I +61 303\n61.2 2.68\n3\n41.0 20.54 6\nQSO 0954+556\n55.0 9.87 2 5.2 0.22 Cygnus X3\nQSO 0954+556\n55.0 9.87 2 5.2 0.22 XTE J1118+480 48.0 11.30 2\nCI Cam\n56.0 4.33\n5\nMiscellaneous\n41.5 20.54 6\n3EG J0450+1105 11.4 4.82 6 4.7 0.72 J2032+4131\nM 87\n12.4 12.51 4 4.9 0.39 NGC 1275\n41.5 3.33\n4\nUHE CR Doublet 20.4 1.28 3 5.1 0.30 UHE CR Triplet 56.9 11.32 6\nAO 0535+26\n26.3 5.65 5 5.0 0.57 PSR J0205+6449 64.8 2.09\n1\nPSR 1951+32\n32.9 19.88 2 5.1 0.21\n\nnb\n\n\u03a6lim\n\u03bd\n\n4.3\n5.2\n5.4\n4.6\n\n0.35\n0.29\n1.3\n0.57\n\n4.5\n4.8\n5.1\n5.2\n3.7\n5.0\n5.4\n5.1\n\n0.21\n0.71\n0.59\n0.40\n0.60\n0.77\n0.20\n0.66\n\n5.3\n5.3\n4.7\n3.7\n\n0.74\n0.41\n0.95\n0.24\n\nTable 1: Results from the AMANDA search for neutrinos from selected objects. \u03b4 is the declination\nin degrees, \u03b1 the right ascension in hours, nobs is the number of observed events, and nb the expected\nbackground. \u03a6lim\nis the 90% CL upper limit in units of 10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 for a spectral index of 2 and\n\u03bd\nintegrated above 10 GeV.

Searches for neutralino dark matter\nThere are several questions in particle physics, which can be studied using high\nenergy neutrino telescopes. Perhaps the most important one is the question about\nthe cold dark matter in the universe. The most popular hypothesis for the nature of\nnon-baryonic dark matter is that it consists of the lightest Supersymmetric particle\n(assuming R-parity conservation), the neutralino, left over from the Big Bang. The\nmass of the neutralino is expected to be in the GeV-TeV range. The neutralinos scatter weakly on baryonic matter, lose energy and may be trapped in the gravitational\nfield of heavy objects like the Sun and the Earth. The neutralinos accumulated in the\ncentre of these objects will annihilate and, among other particles, neutrinos will be\nproduced. Observing high energy neutrinos from the Sun or the centre of the Earth\ncould give evidence for Supersymmetric particles. AMANDA analysis of data from\n1997-1999 (AMANDA-B10) has resulted in the most sensitive limits on muon flux\n\n\fAMANDA 2004\nBAKSAN 1997\nMACRO 2002\nSUPER-K 2004\nIceCube Best-Case\n\nlim\n\u03c3SI\n= CDMS 2005\n\nth\n\nE \u03bc = 1 GeV\n\n10 4\n3\n\n10\n\nlim\n\u03c3SI\n= CDMS 2005\n\nBAKSAN 1997\nMACRO 2002\nSUPER-K 2004\nIceCube Best-Case\nAntares, 3 yrs\nth\nE \u03bc = 1 GeV\n\n10 4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n\u03c3SI >\nlim\nlim\n\u03c3SI\n> \u03c3SI > 0.1\u03c3SI\nlim\n0.1\u03c3SI\n> \u03c3SI\n\n10 5\n\n2\n\n10 2\n\nJ.

The direct and indirect methods are complementary since they\nprobe different parts of the neutralino velocity distribution22) .\n3. IceCube\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory (figure 5) at the Amundsen-Scott base at the\nSouth Pole, Antarctica, is the first fully funded km3 sized neutrino detector project.\nIt will consist of the In-ice array deep in the ice and the IceTop air shower array at\nthe surface. In the ice, 80 strings with 60 Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) each will\nbe deployed between depths of 1450 m and 2450 m (17 m between optical modules).\nThe distance between the strings is 125 m. The instrumented deep ice part will\ncover about one km3 . The IceTop air shower array will consist of two ice Cherenkov\ntanks placed close to each IceCube hole. Each tank is instrumented with two of the\nsame DOMs used in the deep ice. The surface array will be used for calibration and\nbackground studies as well as for cosmic ray studies using the combined detector. This\n\n\fFigure 5: Left: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory with the air shower IceTop at the surface and\nthe In-ice array. The AMANDA telescope is seen inside IceCube as a darker cylinder. The filled\ncircles on top corresponds to completed strings and IceTop stations (February 2006). The open\ncircles corresponds to additional completed IceTop stations. Right: A large air shower event hitting\nIceTop modules and the 9-strings.\n\nis a unique feature of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The AMANDA telescope\nis located inside the volume of IceCube and will be integrated and will extend the\nreach of the IceCube detector to low energies. Parts of the IceCube detector can be\nused as veto in order to define a shielded fiducial volume including AMANDA and\nthe inner IceCube strings in order to improve the acceptance for low energy neutrinos\nfrom e.g. neutralino annihilation in the Sun. The telescope is modular and new\nstrings will be added into the data acquisition system as soon as they are deployed\nand commissioned, giving an increasing sensitivity year by year.\nThe IceCube optical modules are technically more advanced than the ones used\nin AMANDA. They have 25 cm (AMANDA 20 cm) diameter Hamamatsu Photomultipliers tubes (PMTs) and electronics for digitizing and time stamping of the\n(photonic) signals. These Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) transmit the digitized\n\n\fdata to the surface via copper cables. The dynamic range exceeds 250 photoelectrons\nper 10 ns.\n3.1. Construction\nThe deployment of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory takes place during the\naustral summer (November - February). A new more powerful hot water drill has\nbeen developed with a heat power of 5 MW compared to 2 MW for the AMANDA\ndrill. This new drill melts a 60 cm diameter hole 2500 m in less than 40 h (AMANDA\nneeded more than 90 h for 2000 m). The hole is water filled from about 50 m below\nthe surface and allows a deployment time for the DOMs of more than 24 h. Water in\nthe hole refreezes from the top down, after about one week near the top and two weeks\nnear the bottom. In the first season (2004/2005) the hot water drill was assembled\nand tested, and the first IceCube string was successfully deployed (string 21) together\nwith four IceTop stations, in total 60 + 16 DOMs. During the second deployment\nseason (November 2005 - January 2006) eight new strings were successfully deployed\nand 12 more IceTop stations completed, giving a total of nine strings and 16 IceTop\nstations. The configuration of the deployed strings and IceTop stations is shown in\nfigure 5. Given the experience from the first season the hot water drill had been\nimproved and the deployment speed raised to about 4 days per string. This is very\nencouraging and a deployment rate of 14 or more strings and IceTop stations per year\nseems within reach.\n3.2. Experiences from the first deployed string\nAll 60 DOMs in the first string (string 21) and the 16 DOMs in the four IceTop\nstations deployed in February 2005 survived the freezing-in period. The system has\nbeen running during 2005 and the performance of the first string is summarized in\nref24) . The measured DOM noise rate of about 700 Hz is lower than for the AMANDA\nmodules despite a larger PMT. After imposing an artificial dead time to suppress after\npulses, the noise rates are below 400 Hz. This is important for the IceCube supernova\ntrigger which is sensitive to small fluctuations to the general noise rate. The obtained\ntime resolution of the optical modules is within a few ns over distance of 2.5 km.\nThe deployed modules performs as well as, or even better than, expected.\nMuons passing string 21 were reconstructed and compared to the expectation from\nsimulated events. In figure 6 (left) the DOM multiplicity for muon tracks in simulation\nand experimental data is compared and a reasonable agreement can be seen. The\nzenith angle distribution is shown in figure 6 (right ) for different multiplicity cuts\n(azimuth is not possible to reconstruct with only one string). The simulation was\ndone with AMANDA software and will be improved over time probably resulting in\nan even better agreement.\n\n\f10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\ndata\nsimulation\n\n0.4\n\ndata\nsimulation\n\n6\n\n7\n\nentries [ \u22c5 10 ]\n\nentries\n\n10\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nmultiplicity: 8 12 16\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n60\nmultiplicity\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120 140 160 180\nzenith angle [ degrees ]\n\nFigure 6: (left) The number of hit DOMs in muon tracks, compared with simulation for the first\nIceCube string (21).

Here 1800 points straight downward.\n\nThe string 21 is about 328 m from the centre of AMANDA and off-line analysis\nof events in coincidence in string 21 and AMANDA has been done.\nWith only one single string the amount of physics analysis was limited, however,\nin the data taken with string 21 during 2005 two upward going tracks with high\nmultiplies (35 and 50 out of 60) were found, compatible with the expected flux of\natmospheric neutrinos (preliminary).\n3.3. The nine string IceCube\nThe new eight strings are now in an intense period of verification. The volume\ninstrumented by the nine strings is already now the largest in the world. The 540\nDOMs in ice and 64 DOMs in IceTop tanks together with the 677 optical modules in\nAMANDA constitute a very interesting scientific instrument. A recorded air shower\nhitting the Icetop stations and the in ice strings is shown in figure 5.\n4. Conclusions\nThe AMANDA neutrino telescope is taking data for the seventh year. The experience from one year of operating the first IceCube string and the four IceTop stations\nis very good and shows that the equipment performs as expected. The now deployed\nnine strings and IceTop stations will allow a more detailed study of the system as well\nas taking real data for physics analysis. The construction of the IceCube neutrino\nobservatory is proceeding very well.\n5.
