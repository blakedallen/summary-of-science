Introduction\nDenote by Mod(S) the mapping class group of a compact, oriented surface S = Sg,1\nof genus g \u2265 2 with one boundary component; i.e. Mod(S) is the group of homeomorphisms of S fixing \u2202S pointwise up to isotopies fixing \u2202S pointwise. A basic\nquestion to contemplate is: what topological or dynamical data of a mapping class\ncan be extracted from various kinds of algebraic data? Since pseudo-Anosovs are the\nmore complex mapping classes topologically and dynamically, we would like to know\nif a given mapping class is pseudo-Anosov; i.e. it has a representative homeomorphism\nwhich leaves invariant a pair of transverse measured foliations.\nOne kind of algebraic data is the action of a mapping class on \u0393 := \u03c01 (S, \u2217) and\nits various quotients. Specifically, consider the sequence of k-step nilpotent quotients\nNk := \u0393/\u0393k+1 where {\u0393k } is the lower central series of \u0393 defined inductively by\n\u03931 = \u0393\n\n\u0393k = [\u0393, \u0393k\u22121 ] for k > 1\n\nSince elements of Mod(S) fix \u2202S pointwise and we choose the basepoint \u2217 \u2208 \u2202S, we\nobtain a representation Mod(S) \u2192 Aut(\u0393), and furthermore since each \u0393k is characteristic, we obtain a representation for each k:\n\u03c1k : Mod(S) \u2192 Aut(\u0393/\u0393k+1 )\nOne natural question to ask is: given only the datum of \u03c1k (f ) for f \u2208 Mod(S), can\nwe determine if the mapping class is pseudo-Anosov or not? If the mapping class is\ndetermined to be pseudo-Anosov, can we detect the dilatation? This paper is one step\nin answering the first question.\nFor k \u2265 1, we define the kth Torelli group to be Ik (S) := ker(\u03c1k ) (and so with\nour indexing, which is different from some other authors, the classical Torelli group is\nI1 (S)). To each f \u2208 Ik = Ik (S), we associate an invariant \u03a8k (f ) \u2208 End(H1 (S, Z))\nwhich is constructed from \u03c1k+1 (f ). We will prove the following:\nTheorem 1.1 (Criterion for pseudo-Anosovs). Let f \u2208 Ik . If the characteristic polynomial of \u03a8k (f ) is irreducible in Z[x], then f is pseudo-Anosov.\nThis follows immediately from the following theorem which we prove in Section 5. For\nthe remainder of this paper, we let H := H1 (S, Z).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJUSTIN MALESTEIN\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let f \u2208 Ik . If the characteristic polynomial \u03c7(\u03a8k (f )) of \u03a8k (f ) \u2208\nEnd(H) has no (nontrivial) even degree or degree 1 factors over Z, then f is pseudoAnosov.\nSince \u03a8k uses only the data of \u03c1k+1 (f ) and ker(\u03c1k+1 ) = Ik+1 , we obtain the following\ncorollary:\nCorollary 1.3. If f \u2208 Ik satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2, then the whole coset\nf Ik+1 is pseudo-Anosov.\nNote that the data of \u03c11 is not used in Theorem 1.2. Since \u0393/\u03932 = H, the homomorphism \u03c11 is the standard representation into Aut(H) with image isomorphic to the\nintegral symplectic group Sp(2g, Z). It is not too difficult to find a criterion on \u03c11 (f ) for\nf to be pseudo-Anosov, and in fact, Casson and Bleiler give such a criterion in Lemma\n5.1 of [CB]. Casson\u2013Bleiler show that if the characteristic polynomial, \u03c7(\u03c11 (f )), is\nirreducible over Z, has no roots of unity as eigenvalues, and is not g(tn ) for any n > 1\nand g \u2208 Z[x], then f is pseudo-Anosov.\nThe Casson\u2013Bleiler criterion is well-known and has been around for many years.\nIt is unfortunately unable to detect pseudo-Anosovs in any of the Ik simply because\nIk \u2286 ker(\u03c11 ). (This is not to imply that the Casson-Bleiler criterion can detect all\npseudo-Anosovs which act non-trivially on H.) In this sense, this paper is filling in the\ngap that Casson-Bleiler left (for the case of a surface with one boundary component).\nRemark: It is well-known that I1 has pseudo-Anosov elements thanks to criteria of\nThurston, Penner, and others [T] [P] [BH]. However, their methods of finding pseudoAnosovs are all topological as opposed to algebraic in nature. Furthermore, their\ncriteria require the specification of a particular mapping class and thus are not wellsuited to dealing with the information of \u03c1k (f ) \u2208 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+1) which only specifies a\ncoset of Ik . Both Thurston's criterion and Penner's criterion require that a mapping\nclass be described in terms of twists about two multi-curves. In [BH], Bestvina\u2013Handel\ndescribe an algorithm using train tracks that can determine whether any single mapping class is pseudo-Anosov or not. In fact, this algorithm has been implemented in a\ncomputer program by Peter Brinkmann ([Br]).\nLet us now outline the contents of the paper. In Section 2, we recall some basic\nproperties of the series {\u0393k }. We then define for f \u2208 Ik the invariant \u03a8k (f ) \u2208 End(H).\n(\u03a8k (f ) is in general non-trivial which might be rather suprising given that \u03c11 (f ) \u2208\nAut(H) is necessarily trivial.) To define \u03a8k , we need two ingredients: the Johnson\nhomomorphism \u03c4 and contractions\n\u03a62k : \u03932k+1 /\u03932k+2 \u2192 H\n\n\fPSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS AND THE LOWER CENTRAL SERIES OF A SURFACE GROUP\n3\n\nDefining \u03a62k requires a bit of work and is described in Section 4. In Section 3, we will\nrecall the definition of the Johnson homomorphism \u03c4 which we describe here as follows:\n\n\u03c4 : Ik (S) \u2192 Hom\n\n\u221e\nM\n\nm=1\n\n\u0393m /\u0393m+1 ,\n\n\u221e\nM\n\n\u0393m /\u0393m+1\n\nm=k+1\n\n!\n\nWe will denote the image of f under \u03c4 as \u03c4f . We define \u03a8k as follows:\n\u03a8k (f ) :=\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03a6k \u25e6 (\u03c4f |H ) k even\n\u2208 End(H)\n\u03a62k \u25e6 (\u03c4f2 |H ) k odd\n\nNote that the map \u03a8k is a homomorphism for k even but not necessarily for k odd.\nIn Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.2. The general idea of the proof of Theorem 1.2 is\nto use the Nielsen-Thurston classification which states that a mapping class is pseudoAnosov if and only if it is neither reducible nor of finite order. Recall that f is reducible\nif f fixes the isotopy class of an essential 1-dimensional submanifold where essential\nmeans that each component is neither null-homotopic nor homotopic to a boundary\ncomponent. Since I1 is torsion-free, the classification reduces to: f is pseudo-Anosov if\nand only if it is irreducible. We then show that reducibility of f implies that \u03c7(\u03a8k (f ))\nhas a linear or even degree factor by using the fact that a certain subgroup of \u03c01 (S) is\ninvariant under f\u2217 \u2208 Aut(\u03c01 (S)).\nFor any particular f \u2208 Ik , the invariant \u03a8k (f ) is explicitly computable, provided one\ncan compute \u03c4f . In Section 6, we show some mapping classes satisfy the hypothesis\nof Theorem 1.2 by computing \u03a8k (f ) directly. Nevertheless, at present the author has\nnot found whole families of pseudo-Anosovs ranging over either g or k which satisfy\nthe hypothesis of Theorem 1.2. Additionally, in section 6 we compare Theorem 1.2 to\nthe Thurston/Penner criteria.\nRemark: We choose to work with a surface with a boundary component as opposed\nto a closed surface to simplify things technically. The fundamental group of a surface\nwith boundary is a free group. As we shall see in Section 2, this will further imply that\nthe Lie algebra associated to the {\u0393k } is a free Lie algebra. While the author suspects\nthat one may obtain a criterion for closed surfaces from this criterion, he has not done\nso at present.\nAcknowledgements.

Basic facts about the lower central series\nFor the reader's convenience, we recall basic facts about central filtrations of a group.\nSuppose\nG = G1 \u2283 G2 \u2283 G3 . . .\nis a filtration of G by normal subgroups. We call G a central filtration if [Gk , Gl ] \u2286 Gk+l .\nWe recount the following folklore result.\nTheorem 2.1. Let {Gi } be a central filtration of G by normal subgroups. Then, the\nfollowing hold:\n(1) The function Gk \u00d7Gl \u2192 Gk+l given by (x, y) 7\u2192 xyx\u22121 y \u22121 induces a well-defined\nmap\nGk /Gk+1 \u00d7 Gl /Gl+1 \u2192 Gk+l /Gk+l+1\n(2) Using the pairing from (1) as a bracket which we denote by [ , ], we obtain a\ngraded Z-Lie algebra:\nM\nL :=\nGk /Gk+1\nk\n\nFor an explanation and proof see Sections 3.1 and 4.5 of [BL]. Also, we recall for\nthe reader that the lower central series is a central filtration (see 4.4 of [BL]).\nRecall that the fundamental group of a surface with boundary is a free group. The\nLie algebra associated to a free group's lower central series is special as described in\nthe following theorem which is a rephrasing of Theorem 5.12 of [MKS].\n\nTheorem 2.2. Let G be a free group with generators a1 , . . . , an and lower central series\nG1 \u2283 G2 \u2283 . . . . Then the (graded) Z-Lie algebra\nM\nL := (\nGk /Gk+1, [ , ])\nk\n\nis a free Z-Lie algebra. L has as its generating set {a1 , . . . , an } viewed as a subset of\nG1 /G2 .\n\nThe definition of free Lie algebra is exactly what one expects: given a Z-Lie algebra\nL and elements x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 L\u2032 , there exists a unique Lie algebra homomorphism\nh : L \u2192 L\u2032 such that h(ai ) = xi . The free Lie algebra in general is fairly complicated.\nEven computing the rank of Gk /Gk+1 for arbitrary k is nontrivial. Thankfully, free Lie\nalgebras embed in simpler Lie algebras.\nA free associative Z-algebra A with generators b1 , . . . , bn is a noncommutative ring\nwith the universal property that given a Z-algebra A\u2032 and elements x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 A\u2032\nthere is a unique homomorphism h : A \u2192 A\u2032 such that h(bi ) = xi . More concretely,\nA is (canonically isomorphic to) the noncommutative polynomial ring in n variables\nover Z. However, viewing A as a polynomial ring is not particularly convenient for\nthe purposes\npaper. If we let M := Zn , then A is isomorphic to the tensor\nL\u221e of this\n\u2297k\nwhere M \u22970 := Z. The algebra A has a canonical Lie bracket:\nalgebra\nk=0 M\n\u2032\n\n\fPSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS AND THE LOWER CENTRAL SERIES OF A SURFACE GROUP\n5\n\n[x, y] := x \u2297 y \u2212 y \u2297 x. Thus, we have a canonical Lie homomorphism L \u2192 A defined\nby ai 7\u2192 bi . From Corollary 0.3 and Theorem 0.5 of [R], we obtain the following.\nTheorem 2.3. If L is a free Z-Lie algebra with generators a1 , . . . , an and A is a free\nassociative algebra over Z with generators b1 , . . . , bn , then the canonical Lie homomorphism induced by ai 7\u2192 bi is injective.\nMoreover, it is not hard to check that the map L \u2192 A respects the grading.\nNow, let us apply Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 to the group \u0393 := \u03c01 (S) with (free) generators a1 , . . . , a2g . L\nLet L be the graded Lie algebra associated to {\u0393k }. Let A be\n\u221e\n\u2297k\nwhere H \u22970 := Z. Since H \u223c\nthe tensor algebra\n= Z2g , the algebra A is a\nk=0 H\nfree associative\nalgebra To simplify notation, let us define Lk := \u0393k /\u0393k+1 . Recall that\nL\u221e\nA\u223c\n= k=0 M \u2297k where M = Z2g . We have defined the ai as elements of \u03c01 (S), but we\ncan also consider the equivalence class of ai in \u03931 /\u03932 \u2282 L or in H = H \u22971 \u2282 A. Thus,\nwe obtain a natural, injective map L \u2192 A defined by sending \"ai \" to \"ai \".\nThe mapping class group has a natural action on L by considering\n\u221e\nM\n\u0393k /\u0393k+1\nL=\nk=1\n\nas a direct sum of representations Mod(S) \u2192 Aut(\u0393k /\u0393k+1 ). We obtain an action on\nA=\n\n\u221e\nM\n\nH \u2297k\n\nk=0\n\nfrom the action on H. It is not hard to check that the map L \u2192 A respects this action.\nSince the Mod(S)-action on A is induced by the action on H, it factors through to an\nSp(2g, Z)-action and so the Mod(S)-action on L factors through Sp(2g, Z) also (This\ncan also be proven directly.).\n3. The Johnson Homomorphisms\nAll of the results in this section are the work of Johnson, Morita, Hain and others.\nRecall that\nIk := ker(Mod(S) \u2192 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+1 ))\nand H = H1 (S). A preliminary version of the Johnson homomorphism is a map:\n\u03c4 : Ik \u2192 Hom(H, \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2)\nfor each k. Note that the image of f under \u03c4 will be denoted \u03c4f as is standard. We\ndefine the preliminary version as follows. Let f \u2208 Ik . Since f\u2217 acts trivially on \u03931 /\u0393k+1 ,\nwe obtain a well-defined map of sets\ntf : \u03931 /\u0393k+2 \u2192 \u0393k+1/\u0393k+2\nx 7\u2192 f\u2217 (x)x\u22121\nThe following result is one part of Proposition 2.3 in [M3].\n\n\f6\n\nJUSTIN MALESTEIN\n\nProposition 3.1 (Johnson, Morita). The set map tf : \u03931 /\u0393k+2 \u2192 \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 induces\na well-defined homomorphism H \u2192 \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 which is \u03c4f . Moreover, \u03c4 is a homomorphism.\nProof. By the very definition of the lower central series, \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 is in the center of\n\u03931 /\u0393k+2 . Thus,\nf\u2217 (xy)(xy)\u22121 = f\u2217 (xy)y \u22121x\u22121 = f\u2217 (x)(f\u2217 (y)y \u22121)x\u22121 = f\u2217 (x)x\u22121 (f\u2217 (y)y \u22121)\nand so tf is in fact a homomorphism. As \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 is abelian, this homomorphism\nfactors through the abelianization of \u03931 /\u0393k+1 which is \u03931 /[\u03931 , \u03931 ] = \u03931 /\u03932 = H. Hence,\nwe obtain a homomorphism H \u2192 \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 . Now, suppose we are given f, g \u2208 Ik .\nThen, we have\nf\u2217 (g\u2217 (x))x\u22121 = f\u2217 (g\u2217 (x)x\u22121 )f\u2217 (x)x\u22121\n= (f\u2217 (tg (x))tg (x)\u22121 )tg (x)f\u2217 (x)x\u22121 = tf (tg (x))tg (x)tf (x)\nSince tg (x) \u2208 \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 \u2286 ker tf , we find that f\u2217 (g\u2217 (x))x\u22121 = tg (x)tf (x)\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark: In the above proof, we see that ker(tf ) \u2283 \u03932 /\u0393k+2 , and so for x \u2208 \u03932 /\u0393k+2\nwe have\n1 = tf (x) = f\u2217 (x)x\u22121 \u21d2 f (x) = x\nThus f acts trivially on \u03932 /\u0393k+2 and in particular on \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2. Looking at the short\nexact sequence\n(1)\n\n1 \u2192 \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 \u2192 \u03931 /\u0393k+2 \u2192 \u03931 /\u0393k+1 \u2192 1\n\none might think that f must act trivially on \u03931 /\u0393k+2 itself, but this is not the case.\nElements in (\u03931 /\u0393k+2 ) \\ (\u03932 /\u0393k+2) may be changed by elements in \u0393k+1 /\u0393k+2 and this\nis precisely what \u03c4f measures.\nIn view of the remark, we see that \u03c4f retains the information of f\u2217 \u2208 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+2 ).\nFurthermore, \u03c4f determines f\u2217 as an element of Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+2 ) (assuming f \u2208 Ik ). We\nsimply note that f\u2217 (x) = \u03c4f (x)x where x is the projection of x to H. Moreover, the\nfollowing sequence is exact: (see Proposition 2.3 of [M3])\n(2)\n\n1 \u2192 Hom(H, \u0393k+1/\u0393k+2 ) \u2192 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+2 ) \u2192 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+1)\n\nGiven f \u2208 Ik , one can similarly define a function\n\u0393m /\u0393m+k+1 \u2192 \u0393m+k /\u0393m+k+1\n(3)\n\nx 7\u2192 f\u2217 (x)x\u22121\n\nAs before, this induces a well-defined homomorphism \u0393m /\u0393m+1 \u2192 \u0393m+k /\u0393m+k+1 . (See\nLemma 3.2 of [M2].)\nConsider the free associative algebra A as defined in the previous section. Suppose\none has chosen 2g elements {x1 , ..., x2g } \u2286 A. From general theory about the free\nassociative algebra, we know there is then a unique derivation D : A \u2192 A such that\n\n\fPSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS AND THE LOWER CENTRAL SERIES OF A SURFACE GROUP\n7\n\nD(ai ) = xi where the ai are generators of A (see [R]). The following computation\nshows that D(L) \u2286 L and that D is a derivation on L:\nD[y, z] = D(yz \u2212 zy) = (Dy)z + yDz \u2212 (Dz)y \u2212 zDy = [Dy, z] + [y, Dz]\nThus, given f \u2208 Ik , there is a unique derivation Df of A which extends \u03c4f . It\nturns out that extending \u03c4f to all of L yields the same result regardless of whether one\nrestricts Df or uses (3). The following proposition follows more or less from Lemma\n2.3 and Proposition 2.5 of [M2].\nProposition 3.2 (Morita). For all m \u2265 1, the map defined by (3) induces a homomorphism \u0393m /\u0393m+1 \u2192 \u0393m+k /\u0393m+k+1 and is equal to the map Df |Lm .\nBy abuse of notation, we will denote the extention to L by \u03c4f . The map \u03c4 has other\nnice algebraic properties. They are collected in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.3 (Morita). Let \u03c4 be as defined above, a collection of homomorphisms\nIk \u2192 Der(L), one for each k. Then, the following hold:\n(a) The map \u03c4 : Ik \u2192 Der(L) is a homomorphism with kernel Ik+1 (S). Hence, it\ninduces a well-defined homomorphism Ik /Ik+1 (S) \u2192 Der(L)\n(b) The abelian group\n\u221e\nM\nIk /Ik+1 (S)\nk=1\n\nhas a Lie algebra structure induced by\n\nIm (S) \u00d7 In (S) \u2192 Im+n (S)\n(f, g) 7\u2192 f gf \u22121g \u22121 =: [f, g]\n(c) \u03c4 induces a Lie algebra homomorphism\n\u221e\nM\nIk (S)/Ik+1(S) \u2192 Der(L)\nk=1\n\nFurthermore, \u03c4 respects the conjugation action of Mod(S) on Ik and Der(L).\n\nProof Sketch: This proof sketch will consist mainly of citations. For (a), recall that\nby Proposition 3.1, \u03c4f \u25e6g |H = \u03c4f |H + \u03c4g |H . Since the derivations \u03c4f \u25e6g and \u03c4f + \u03c4g agree\non generators, they must agree on all of L. One deduces the kernel is Ik+1 (S) from\nthe exact sequence in (2). Part (b) is Proposition 4.1 of [M1]. Also Proposition 4.7\nof [M1] shows (in slightly different notation) that \u03c4[f,g] |H = (\u03c4f \u03c4g \u2212 \u03c4g \u03c4f )|H . Since the\ntwo derivations \u03c4[f,g] and \u03c4f \u03c4g \u2212 \u03c4g \u03c4f agree on H and since H generates L, we must\nhave equality. To show that the Mod(S) action is respected, we use the definition of\n\u03c4f given by (3). Suppose g \u2208 Mod(S). In \u0393m /\u0393m+k+1\n\u03c4gf g\u22121 (x) = g(f (g \u22121(x)))x\u22121 = g(f (g(x))g \u22121(x\u22121 ))\n= g(f (g \u22121(x))(g \u22121 (x))\u22121 ) = g(\u03c4f (g \u22121(x)))\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nJUSTIN MALESTEIN\n\nRemark: A priori, it may seem that, for f \u2208 Ik , we are using the entire action of\nf\u2217 on \u03c01 (S) since we use the action on \u0393m /\u0393m+k+1 for all m. This would conflict\nwith the characterization given in the introduction that we only use the data of f\u2217 \u2208\nAut(\u03931 /\u0393k+2). However, since \u03c4f is a derivation on L which is generated by H, it is\ncompletely determined by \u03c4f |H which is itself determined by f\u2217 \u2208 Aut(\u03931 /\u0393k+2).\n4. The Contractions \u03a6k\nOur goal in this section is to find a contraction Lk+1 \u2192 L1 respecting the Spaction and thus the Mod(S)-action by the results of Section 2. We remark that we\nwant to respect the action so that \u03c7(\u03a8k (f )) will depend only on the conjugacy class\nof f and because the argument in Section 5 implicitly uses a change of coordinates.\nThe following theorem simplifies this problem. Below, HomSp will denote the set of\nhomomorphisms which respect the Sp action, and, for X an Sp-representation, XSp\nwill indicate the space of vectors fixed by the Sp action. While I suspect the following\nmay be known, I was not able to find it in the literature.\nTheorem 4.1. If f \u2208 HomSp (Lk+1, L1 ), then \u2203 n \u2208 Z such that nf is the restriction\nof an element g \u2208 HomSp (Ak+1, A1 ), where Am is the summand H \u2297m \u2282 A.\nProof. The theorem will follow if we can find a bilinear pairing on each Ak+1 which is\nnondegenerate on both Ak+1 and Lk+1 . Let {a1 , b1 , ..., ag , bg } be a symplectic basis of\nH1 (S). The ai and bi also serve as a free generating set of L as a Lie algebra and of A\nas an associative algebra. We can easily define a pairing h , i which is nondegenerate\non Ak+1 . If x = x1 \u2297 x2 ... \u2297 xk+1 and y = y1 \u2297 y2 ... \u2297 yk+1, then set\nhx, yi := hx1 , y1 ihx2 , y2 i...hxk+1 , yk+1i\nwhere hxi , yi i is the algebraic intersection pairing on H.\nNow, let \u03b8 \u2208 Aut(A) be the algebra homomorphism defined by \u03b8(ai ) = bi and\n\u03b8(bi ) = \u2212ai . In particular, if w = x1 \u2297 x2 * * * \u2297 xn then \u03b8(w) = \u03b8(x1 ) \u2297 \u03b8(x2 )... \u2297 \u03b8(xn ).\nLet Yk be the canonical basis of H \u2297k induced by the basis of H (i.e. tensoring the\na's and b's in every possible order). For two elementsP\ny, y \u2032 \u2208 Yk , one easily sees that\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhy, y i =\n6 0 if and only if y = \u00b1\u03b8(y). Then, for P = y cy y, we have hP, \u03b8(P )i > 0,\nP\nsince all \"cross terms\" vanish and we are left with y c2y hy, \u03b8(P )i.\nWe now wish to show that h , i is nondegenerate on the embedded copy of Lk+1 , but\nthis is almost immediate. We only need that P \u2208 Lk+1 implies \u03b8(P )Lk+1. Indeed,\nsince L is the Lie subalgebra of A generated by {a1 , b1 , ..., ag , bg } and since \u03b8 preserves\nthe Lie bracket and (up to sign) permutes the generators {a1 , b1 , ..., ag , bg }, we see that\n\u03b8(L) = L.\nSuppose f \u2208 HomSp (Lk+1, L1 ) \u223c\n= (L\u2217k+1 \u2297 L1 )Sp . Since Lk+1 and L\u2217k+1 are finitely\ngenerated free Z-modules, the pairing h , i gives an embedding Lk+1 \u0592\u2192 L\u2217k+1 whose\nimage has finite index. Thus, there is some n \u2208 Z such that nf is in the image of\n\n\fPSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS AND THE LOWER CENTRAL SERIES OF A SURFACE GROUP\n9\n\n(Lk+1 \u2297 L1 )Sp , but we have\n(Lk+1 \u2297 L1 )Sp \u0592\u2192 (Ak+1 \u2297 A1 )Sp \u0592\u2192 (A\u2217k+1 \u2297 A1 )Sp \u223c\n= HomSp (Ak+1, A1 )\nThus, nf is the restriction of some g \u2208 HomSp (Ak+1, A1 ).\n\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.1 and its proof reduce our problem to finding tensors in (Ak+1 \u2297 A1 )Sp \u223c\n=\n\u2297k+2\n(H\n)Sp . Thus, if k = 2n is even, we obtain such a tensor by taking the symplectic\nP\n\u2297(n+1)\npairing \u03c90 = i (ai \u2297 bi \u2212 bi \u2297 ai ) and taking high tensor powers, i.e. \u03c90\n. The\n\u2297(n+1)\nelement \u03c90\nrepresents the contraction\n!\nn\nY\nx1 \u2297 x2 ... \u2297 xk+1 7\u2192\nhx2j\u22121 , x2j i xk+1\nj=1\n\nThis contraction is what we denote by \u03a6k .\nThere is an obvious action of the permutation group S2m on H \u22972m . Since Sp(2g, Z)\nacts diagonally on H \u22972m , it is easy to see that for any \u03c3 \u2208 S2m , we have \u03b7 \u2208 (H \u22972m )Sp\nif and only if \u03c3(\u03b7) \u2208 (H \u22972m )Sp . Thus, all the vectors \u03c3(\u03c90\u22972m ) are Sp-invariant as well.\nFor every \u03c3 \u2208 S2m , there is a corresponding \u03c3 \u2032 so that \u03c3(\u03c902m ) corresponds to the\ncontraction\n!\nn\nY\nx1 \u2297 x2 ... \u2297 xm\u22121 7\u2192\nhx\u03c3\u2032 (2j\u22121) , x\u03c3\u2032 (2j) i x\u03c3\u2032 (m\u22121)\nj=1\n\nFurthermore, it is a classical result of Weyl (see, e.g., Section 4.1 of [M4]) that {\u03c3(\u03c90\u22972m)}\u03c3\u2208S2m\nis a generating set for ((H \u2297 Q)\u22972m )Sp(2g,Q) .\n5. Proof of theorem 1.2\n\nRecall from above that for each k \u2265 1 we defined a map\n\u03a8k : Ik \u2192 End(H)\n\u001a\n\u03a6k \u25e6 (\u03c4f |H ) k even\nf 7\u2192\n\u03a62k \u25e6 (\u03c4f2 |H ) k odd\n\nWe remark that the following proof of the main theorem remains valid if we replace\n\u03a6k with any of the contractions induced by a \u03c3(\u03c90k+2) described in Section 4. In the\nfollowing, all factorization and irreducibility is with respect to Z[x].\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let f \u2208 Ik . Recall that the Nielsen\u2013Thurston classification and\ntorsion-freeness of I1 \u2287 Ik imply that f is pseudo-Anosov if and only if f is irreducible.\nIt is well-known that I1 is pure, meaning that if an isotopy class of 1-submanifold is\nfixed, then each component of the 1-submanifold is fixed (see Theorem 1.2 of [I]). Thus,\nthe proof of Theorem 1.2 reduces to proving the following two claims.\nClaim 1: Suppose f fixes an essential separating curve. Then, the characteristic\npolynomial of \u03a8k (f ) factors into two (nontrivial) even degree polynomials in Z[x].\n\n\f10\n\nJUSTIN MALESTEIN\n\nClaim 2: Suppose f fixes a nonseparating curve. Then, \u03a8k (f ) has an eigenvector\nover Z.\nBefore we begin the proofs of Claims 1 and 2, we state a theorem that will be used\nfor both. (This is Theorem 2.5 in [R])\nTheorem 5.1 (Shirshov, Witt). If L\u2032 is a subalgebra of a free Lie algebra L over a\nfield, then L\u2032 is a free Lie algebra .\nProof of Claim 1: Let \u03b3 be the (oriented) separating curve such that f (\u03b3) = \u03b3.\nCutting along \u03b3 separates S into a \u03a3g1 ,1 =: S1 and a \u03a3g2 ,2 =: S2 where g1 + g2 = g.\nLet C (resp. D) be the image of H1 (S1 , Z) (resp. H1 (S2 , Z)) in H. Since, f (Si ) = Si\n(up to isotopy), one might hope that either \u03a8k (f )(C) \u2286 C or \u03a8k (f )(D) \u2286 D. We will\nshow that this actually holds for D.\nWe begin by defining a submodule of L:\nM\nM :=\n(\u039b \u2229 \u0393m /\u039b \u2229 \u0393m+1 )\nm\n\nwhere \u039b := \u03c01 (S2 ). Note that M \u2229 L1 = D. Step 1 is to show that \u03c4f (M) \u2286 M. Step\n2 is to show that M is a free Lie subalgebra and give generators of M as a Lie algebra.\nStep 3 is to show, using the generators, that for any x \u2208 M we have \u03a6n (x) \u2208 D. Then,\nit is clear from the definition of \u03a8k that for d \u2208 D, we have \u03a8k (f )(d) \u2208 D. Since D is\nan even rank subspace, that will complete the proof.\nFirst, we need to set up some notation. Let p1 \u2208 \u2202S1 (resp. p2 \u2208 \u2202S2 ) be the basepoint of S1 (resp S2 and S). Let \u03b1 be a path from p2 to p1 , and let \u03b3\u0303 = \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u22121 \u2208 \u03c01 (S2 ).\nLet \u03b9 (resp. \u03b9\u0302) denote geometric (resp. algebraic) intersection number of unbased ho2(g2 )\n1\nmotopy classes of closed curves. Choose {c\u2032i }2g\ni=1 \u2208 \u03c01 (S1 , p1 ) and {di }i=1 \u2208 \u03c01 (S1 , p2 )\nwith the following properties (see Figure 1):\n2(g )\n\n2\n1\n(a) The set {c\u2032i }2g\ni=1 (resp. {\u03b3\u0303} \u222a {di }i=1 ) generates \u03c01 (S1 , p1 ) (resp. \u03c01 (S2 , p2 )).\n\n(b) For all m, n, we have \u03b9(c\u2032m , dn ) = \u03b9\u0302(c\u2032m , dn ) = 0.

We remark that a similar statement\nis not true for S1 . Indeed, to embed \u03c01 (S1 ) in \u03c01 (S) requires that we choose a path\nconnecting base points (e.g. \u03b1); even after choosing a representative homeomorphism\nof f which fixes \u03b3 pointwise, this path is not necessarily preserved (up to homotopy\nrel endpoints).\nRecall that one way of defining \u03c4f is to induce it from the map\n\u0393m \u2192 \u0393m+k\nx 7\u2192 f\u2217 (x)x\u22121\nSince f\u2217 (\u039b) = \u039b, it is easy to see that\nM\nM=\n(\u039b \u2229 \u0393m /\u039b \u2229 \u0393m+1 )\nm\n\nis a \u03c4f -invariant submodule of L.\nStep 2: We wish to show M is a Lie subalgebra and find its generators. We will do\nthis showing that M is the Lie algebra homomorphic image of a Lie algebra N whose\ngenerators are easily found.\n\n\f12\n\nJUSTIN MALESTEIN\n\nWe first define a filtration of \u039b which is a slight alteration of the lower central series.\nWe let\n\u230am\u230b\n\n2\nfor m \u2265 3\n\u039b1 := \u03c01 (S2 ) \u039b2 := h[\u039b1 , \u039b1 ], \u03b3\u0303i \u039bm := h[\u039bm\u2212n , \u039bn ]in=1\n\nBy Theorem 2.1,\nN :=\n\nM\n\n\u039bn /\u039bn+1\n\nn\n\nis a graded Z-Lie algebra under the commutation bracket. Since j\u2217 (\u039bn ) \u2286 \u0393n , there\nis an induced Lie algebra homomorphism N \u2192 L. It is easy to check that, as a Lie\n2\n\u2032\nalgebra, N is generated by {di }2g\ni=1 \u222a {\u03b3\u0303} and so its image M := j\u2217 (N) in L is also\n2\ngenerated by {di }2g\ni=1 \u222a {\u03b3\u0303} (viewed in L).\nProposition 5.2. N maps isomorphically onto M \u2032\nProof of Proposition 5.2. We wish to use Theorem 5.1, but L is not an algebra over a\nfield. As Q is a flat Z-module, we have M \u2032 \u2297 Q \u0592\u2192 L \u2297 Q, and so MQ\u2032 := M \u2032 \u2297 Q is\n2(g )\na free Lie algebra generated by {di }i=12 \u222a {\u03b3\u0303}, but it is not a priori clear that these\ngenerators are free. In the proof of Theorem 5.1 in [R], a recipe is given for finding free\ngenerators of a subalgebra, which we describe now.\nFor any subset X \u2286 L \u2297 Q, let hXi denote the Lie subalgebra of L \u2297 Q generated\nby X. Let\n!\nn\nM\n\u2032\nEn = MQ \u2229\nLi \u2297 Q\ni=1\n\nEn\u2032\n\nand let\n= En \u2229 hEn\u22121 i.SIf we let Xn := a set of generators (as a Q vector space)\nfor En mod En\u2032 , then X = n Xn is a free generating set of MQ\u2032 .\nWe now show the afore-mentioned generators of MQ\u2032 to be free. Clearly, we can set\n2\nX1 := {di }2g\ngenerated by X1 .\ni=1 . The\nQg1only question is whether \u03b3\u0303 is in the Lie\nPalgebra\ng1\nRecall that \u03b3\u0303 = i=1 [ci , ci+g1 ] and so in L2 , we have \u03b3\u0303 = i=1 [ci , ci+g1 ]. As elements\nof H, the ci and di freely generate L \u2297 Q, so \u03b3\u0303 \u2208\n/ hX1 i. Thus, we can set X2 = {\u03b3\u0303},\n2g2\n\u2032\nand so {di }i=1 \u222a {\u03b3\u0303} freely generates MQ . But then clearly it freely generates M \u2032 .\nNow, we can define an inverse Lie homomorphism M \u2032 \u2192 N by sending generators\nto generators, and so N \u2192 L is injective.\n\u0003\nBy the proposition, we have \u039bn \\ \u039bn+1 \u0592\u2192 \u0393n \\ \u0393n+1 , but this implies that in fact\n\u039bn = \u039b \u2229 \u0393n . Thus, M = M \u2032 .\nStep 3: Recall that C = image of H1 (S1 ) and D = image of H1 (S2 ) in H; i.e.\n2(g2 )\n1\nC = h{ci }2g\ni=1 i and D = h{di }i=1 i . Suppose x \u2208 D.

We can write \u03b3\u0303 in A as 2g\ni=1 (ci \u2297 ci+g1 \u2212 ci+g1 \u2297 ci ). Thus, M is\ncontained in the subring generated by\n( 2g\n)\n1\nX\n2(g )\n(ci \u2297 ci+g1 \u2212 ci+g1 \u2297 ci ) \u222a {di }i=12\ni=1\n\nP\nConsequently, we can write y = m ym,1 \u2297 ... \u2297 ym,n where an even number of the\nelements of {ym,1, ..., ym,n } are in C and the rest are in D. Since \u03b9\u0302(ci , dj ) = 0 for all\ni, j, we have \u03a6n\u22121 (ym,1 \u2297 ... \u2297 ym,n ) 6= 0 only if ym,n \u2208 D. Thus, \u03a8k (f )(D) \u2286 D, and\nwe are done with Claim 1.\nProof of Claim 2: Let \u03b1 be the nonseparating curve which is fixed by f \u2208 Ik . Let \u015c\nbe the surface obtained by cutting along \u03b1, and j : \u015c \u0592\u2192 S the canonical immersion.\nSimilar to the proof of Claim 1, we will show that \u03a8k (f )(C) \u2286 C where C := image of\nH1 (\u015c, Z) in H. Analagous to the above, we let\nM\n\u0393\u0302 \u2229 \u0393n /\u0393\u0302 \u2229 \u0393n+1\nM :=\nn\n\nwhere \u0393\u0302 = \u03c01 (\u015c).

Let \u03b11 and \u03b12 be the boundary curves of \u015c such\nthat j\u2217 (\u03b11 ) = j\u2217 (\u03b12 ) = \u03b1. Choose based representatives a, a1 and a2 of \u03b1, \u03b11 and \u03b12\nrespectively as in Figure 2; in particular, j\u2217 (a1 ) = a. Also, let b be as depicted in Figure\n2(g\u22121)\n2. Extend {a, b} to a \"standard\" generating set {a, b} \u222a {ci }i=1 ; i.e. the following\nhold:\n2(g\u22121)\n\n(a) The set {a, b} \u222a {ci }i=1 gives a symplectic basis in homology.\n(b) \u03b9(a, b) = \u03b9\u0302(a, b) = 1.\n(c) All ci can be homotoped to lie entirely inside the interior of \u015c.\n\u22121\nLetting a1 and a2 be as in Figure 2, one can easily check that j\u2217 (a1 a\u22121\n2 ) = [a, b ].\n\nStep 1: Choosing the same basepoint for \u015c and S, we have that j\u2217 : \u03c01 (\u015c) \u2192 \u03c01 (S) is\ninjective and \u0393\u0302 = \u03c01 (\u015c) is invariant under f\u2217 .

Theorem 1.2 vs. the Thurston\u2013Penner Criteria\nIn this section we will compare the criterion of Theorem 1.2 to the Thurston\u2013Penner\ncriteria. Since the Thurston\u2013Penner criteria are topological and Theorem 1.2 is algebraic, one might expect that there is essentially no relation between the two. We\nwill show this to be true in the following sense. There exist examples satisfying the\nThurston or Penner criteria but not the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2 and examples satisfying both. As of the writing of this paper, it has not been proven that there are\nexamples of pseudo-Anosovs which do not satisfy the Thurston\u2013Penner criteria. However, we will give an example satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2 to which the\nThurson\u2013Penner criteria do not seem to apply directly.\nSince we will be dealing with Dehn twists about separating curves, we first describe\n\u03a82 (T\u03b3 ) where \u03b3 is a \"standard\" separating curve and T\u03b3 is the Dehn twist about \u03b3.\nFirst let us set up a symplectic basis. Let {\u03b1i , \u03b2i } be the curves as depicted in Figure 3\nwith ai = [\u03b1i ] and bi = [\u03b2i ] their homology classes. Our ordered basis of H throughout\nthis section will be {a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 , . . . , ag , bg }.

Recall that \u03a62 (c1 \u2297c2 \u2297c3 ) = \u03b9\u0302(c1 , c2 )c3 . We\nthen compute for j \u2264 i that \u03a82 (fi ) = \u03a62 (\u03c4fi (aj )) = (2i + 1)aj . Clearly, \u03a62 (\u03c4fi (aj )) = 0\nfor j > i. The computation for bj is the same but with the the roles of a and b\nswitched.\n\u0003\nNow let us consider T\u03b3 where \u03b3 is an arbitrary separating curve not homotopic to\nthe boundary. Recall that \u03a8k is Mod(S)-equivariant (This follows from the Mod(S)equivariance of \u03a6k and \u03c4 ). The Mod(S) action on End(H) is as follows. If \u03c6 \u2208 Mod(S)\n\n\fPSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS AND THE LOWER CENTRAL SERIES OF A SURFACE GROUP\n17\n\nand h \u2208 End(H), then\n\u03c6 * h = [\u03c6]h[\u03c6]\u22121\nwhere [\u03c6] denotes the projection of \u03a6 to Sp(2g, Z). Thus, for f \u2208 I2 and \u03c6 \u2208 Mod(S),\nwe find that \u03a8k (\u03c6f \u03c6\u22121 ) = [\u03c6]\u03a8k (f )[\u03c6]\u22121 . Recall that if for a fixed g \u2032 , two separating\ncurves \u03b71 and \u03b72 both cut S into a \u03a3g\u2032 ,1 and a \u03a3g\u2212g\u2032 ,2 , then there is some \u03c6 \u2208 Mod(S)\nsuch that \u03c6(\u03b71 ) = \u03b72 . Thus, \u03a82 (T\u03b3 ) is of the form \u03c6\u03a82 (T\u03b3i )\u03c6\u22121 for some i and some\n\u03c6 \u2208 Sp(2g, Z). Similarly, if A is a multicurve of separating curves and TA the multicurve\ntwist, then\nm\nY\n\u03a82 (TA ) = \u03c6\u03a82 ( T\u03b3ik )\u03c6\u22121\nk=1\n\nfor some \u03c6 \u2208 Sp(2g, Z) and some subset {\u03b3ik } of {\u03b3i }.\nFor the reader's convenience, we recall a few definitions and state a corollary to both\nthe Thurston and Penner criteria. A pants decomposition is a maximal set of pairwise\nnonisotopic simple closed curves which are pairwise disjoint not null-homotopic. For\nan Sg,b , a pants decomposition consists of 3g \u22123+2b curves. Recall that a simple closed\ncurve \u03b3 is essential if it is neither homotopically trivial nor homotopic to a boundary\ncomponent. We say that two curves \u03b7 and \u03bd fill a surface S if, for any essential simple\nclosed curve \u03b3, the curve \u03b3 either intersects \u03b7 or \u03bd nontrivially. We define the notion\nof filling for two multicurves similarly.\nCorollary 6.2 (Thurston, Penner). If two multicurves A and B fill a surface, then\nthe product of multicurve twists TA TB\u22121 is pseudo-Anosov.\n6.1. Negative Results for Theorem 1.2. In this section we show that there is a\npseudo-Anosov in I2 (Sg,1) for each g \u2265 2 which satisfies the Thurston\u2013Penner criteria\nbut not the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2. Let T\u03b3 denote the twist about a simple closed\ncurve \u03b3.\nTheorem 6.3. For each g \u2265 2, there exists two simple closed curves \u03b3g,1 and \u03b3g,2\nfilling S = Sg,1 such that fg := T\u03b3g,1 T\u03b3\u22121\ndoes not satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem\ng,2\n1.2. However, by the Thurston\u2013Penner criteria, we know fg is pseudo-Anosov.\nProof. We break the proof into two cases. For g = 2, we will explicitly compute\n\u03a82 (f2 ). For g \u2265 3, we will show that there is an fg\u2032 such that fg\u2032 is reducible and\n\u03a82 (fg\u2032 ) = \u03a82 (fg ). Of course, then it is impossible for \u03a8(fg ) to satisfy the hypothesis of\nTheorem 1.2 since \u03a8(fg\u2032 ) does not.\nWe also need a consequence of Lemma 2 of Expose 13 of [FLP] to construct the fg .\nFor the reader's convenience, we state the consequence.\nLemma 6.4.
