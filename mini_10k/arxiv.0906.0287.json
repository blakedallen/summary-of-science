The most direct route to investigate the evolution of early-type galaxies is to observe them at different\nredshifts. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find the progenitors of early-type galaxies by direct observations, and\nthis method also demands large amounts of observing time\neven on the current generation of telescopes. An alternative\napproach is to infer the star formation histories (SFHs) of\nlarge samples of nearby galaxies by studying their stellar\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: siloubser@uclan.ac.uk (SIL)\n\npopulation properties and the relationships between these\nand the structural and kinematic properties of the galaxies.\nIn the context of the, now widely accepted, \u039bCDM\nmodel of structure formation, Dubinski (1998) showed that\na central cluster galaxy forms naturally when a cluster collapses along the filaments. Gao et al. (2004), using numerical simulations, predicted that central galaxies in clusters\nexperienced a significant number of mergers since z \u223c 1.\nDe Lucia & Blaizot (2007) provided a complete quantitative\nestimate of the formation of BCGs using the Millennium\nsimulation. They predicted that the stars that will end up\nin a BCG formed at high redshift (with 50 per cent of the\nstars already formed \u223c 12.5 Gyr ago). However, the BCG\ncontinues to assemble at much lower redshifts (with 50 per\ncent of the mass assembling after z \u223c 0.5). The nature of\nthese mergers (or accretion) is dissipationless and, therefore,\n\n\f2\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nno new stars are formed in the process. Thus, according to\nthese simulations, we expect to see evidence of dissipationless mergers, little dependence of metallicity on mass, and\nold stellar populations in these galaxies.\nBecause of their position in the cluster, the mergers\nforming BCGs are expected to be with preferentially radial\norbits. Boylan-Kolchin, Ma & Quataert (2006) showed that\nthese types of mergers, in absence of dissipation, create systems that depart from the Faber\u2013Jackson relationship in the\nsame way as BCGs do (Tonry 1984; Oegerle & Hoessel 1991;\nBernardi et al. 2007; Desroches et al. 2007; Lauer et al. 2007;\nVon der Linder et al. 2007). Observations that support BCG\nformation by predominantly radial mergers include those of\nBernardi et al. (2008), who showed that the shapes of the\nmost massive (\u03c3 > 350 km s\u22121 ), high luminosity objects\n(with properties similar to BCG properties) are consistent\nwith those expected if the objects formed through radial\nmergers. Observations of the luminosity functions of clusters\nput additional constraints on BCG evolution. Loh & Strauss\n(2006) found the luminosity gap between the first and second\nbrightness-ranked galaxies to be large (\u223c 0.8 mag), larger\nthan could be explained by an exponentially decaying luminosity function of galaxies. Loh & Strauss (2006) found that\nthe large luminosity gap showed little evolution with redshift since z = 0.4, and suggest that the BCGs must have\nbecome the dominant cluster members by z > 0.4.\nVarious photometric studies have found correlations between the luminosity of the BCG and the mass or density\nof the host cluster, measured through the cluster velocity\ndispersion and X-ray luminosity (e.g. Edge & Stewart 1991;\nBurke, Collins & Mann 2000; Brough et al. 2002; Whiley\net al. 2008; Stott et al. 2008). Taken together, these observations point to an evolutionary history of BCGs which are\nclosely connected to the evolution of the cluster, as predicted\nby the hierarchical models of galaxy formation, although it\nis not clear if the amount of galaxy growth due to accretion\nagrees with these models (e.g. Whiley et al. 2008).\nThe mass growth of BCGs with redshift have been wellstudied. Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca, Baugh & Kauffmann (1998) investigated the evolution of K-magnitudes since z \u223c 1 and\nfound the lack of evolution in the magnitudes compatible\nwith mass growth of a factor of two to four since z \u223c 1.\nHowever, other studies have found a more modest stellar\nmass growth of BCGs since those redshifts (e.g. Collins &\nMann 1998; Whiley et al. 2008), although it is known that\nthe amount of mass growth in BCGs depends on the luminosity of the host clusters (Burke et al. 2000; Brough et al.\n2002). No significant BCG stellar mass growth is observed\nin the most X-ray luminous clusters (LX > 1.9 \u00d7 1044 erg\ns\u22121 ) since z \u223c 1, whereas BCGs in less X-ray luminous clusters experience an increase in their mass by a factor of four\nin that redshift range (Brough et al. 2002). However, more\nrecent studies using the velocity dispersion of the cluster\ninstead of X-ray luminosity, have not confirmed this trend\n(Whiley et al. 2008).\nThe contradictory results might be partially due to the\ndifficulty in the sample selection and in the comparison between aperture magnitudes (observations) and total magnitudes (models; e.g. Whiley et al. 2008). Aperture magnitudes\nused so far in the literature include less than 50 per cent of\nthe total mass of the BCGs. Furthermore, it is not clear if\n\nintracluster light should be considered when comparing with\nthe models (Gonz\u00e1lez, Zaritsky & Zabludoff 2007).\nAn alternative to measuring the BCG mass growth with\nredshift to study their evolution, is to analyse their dynamical, structural and stellar population properties, and investigate if these are compatible with that expected from remnants of multiple dry mergers over a large redshift range.\nCooling flows are very common at low redshifts (Chen et\nal. 2007; Edwards et al. 2007), but their role in shaping the\nstellar populations of BCGs is not fully understood. The lack\nof widespread detection of iron lines, expected from cluster\ngas cooling below 1 \u2013 2 keV in XMM-Newton observations\nof cool-core clusters, contradicted the model that BCG formation is a consequence of cooling flows (Jord\u00e1n et al. 2004;\nsee also discussion in Loubser et al. 2008, hereafter Paper\n1). However, it is possible that star formation is ongoing\nin cool-core clusters at a much reduced rate (Bildfell et al.\n2008). Several studies reported examples of recent or ongoing star formation in BCGs hosted by cooling-flow clusters\n(Cardiel, Gorgas & Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca 1998a; Crawford et\nal. 1999; McNamara et al. 2006; Edwards et al. 2007; O'Dea\net al. 2008; Bildfell et al. 2008; Pipino et al. 2009). However,\nthe origin of the gas fuelling the recent star formation in\nsome BCGs is not yet known. The competing explanations\ninclude cooling flows, or cold gas deposited during a merging\nevent (Bildfell et al. 2008).\nThis paper is the second in a series of papers investigating a new, large sample of BCGs, their kinematic and\nstellar population properties and the relationships between\nthese and the properties of the host clusters. The first paper was devoted to the spatially resolved kinematics of 41\nBCGs (Paper 1). Here, we measure and interpret BCG spectral line strengths to gain insights into their stellar populations. The stellar populations in early-type galaxies have\nbeen studied by numerous authors (Gonz\u00e1lez 1993; Fisher,\nFranx & Illingworth 1995; J\u00f8rgensen 1999; Mehlert et al.\n2000; Trager et al. 2000a,b; Kuntschner et al. 2001; Moore\net al. 2002; Caldwell, Rose & Colcannon 2003; Nelan et al.\n2005; Thomas et al. 2005; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006a,\n2006b, 2006c; Trager, Faber & Dressler 2008; Ogando et al.\n2008 and many others). However, as discussed in detail in\nPaper 1, very little is known about the stellar population\nproperties of BCGs. Recently, Von der Linden et al. (2007)\ncarried out a study of 625 brightest group and cluster galaxies, taken from the SDSS, to contrast their stellar population properties with those of elliptical galaxies with the same\nmass. They found that stellar populations of BCGs are not\ndifferent from the stellar populations of ordinary elliptical\ngalaxies, except for the \u03b1-enhancement, which is higher in\nBCGs. Brough et al. (2007), with a much smaller sample,\ndid not find this difference.\nThe study of Von der Linden et al. (2007) constitutes\na benchmark in the study of stellar populations in BCGs.\nHowever, they did not have spatial information. The merger\nhistory of a galaxy determines the kinematical and stellar\npopulation properties and these can, therefore, be used as a\nprobe for the assembly history of those galaxies. Brough et\nal. (2007) showed that BCGs present a large spread in their\nmetallicity gradients, probably reflecting differences in their\nassembly history and the dissipation during the interactions.\nIn Paper 1 we showed that our sample of BCGs shows great\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\nvariety in the galaxies' dynamical and kinematic properties\n(see also Brough et al. 2007).\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the central properties\nof these galaxies. The stellar population gradients and reconstructed SFHs will be investigated in future papers in the\nseries. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains the details of the sample selection, observations and\ndata reduction. Section 3 contains the central index measurements and their relations with the velocity dispersions\nof the BCGs. The single stellar populations (SSPs) are derived, and compared with those of ordinary elliptical galaxies in Section 4. Section 5 shows the relations of the derived\nproperties with the galaxy kinematics, and Section 6 details\nthe context of the cluster environment. The conclusions are\nsummarised in Section 7.\n\n2\n\nSAMPLE, OBSERVATIONS AND DATA\nREDUCTION\n\nThis study was initially intended to investigate a subsample of BCGs with extended haloes (cD galaxies). However,\ndue to the difficulties in the classification of cD galaxies and\nthe very inhomogeneous definitions in the literature, we cannot be confident that all the galaxies in our sample are cD\ngalaxies. Instead, we can say that our sample comprises of\nthe dominant galaxies closest to the X-ray peaks in the centres of clusters. For consistency, we call these galaxies BCGs\nto comply with recent literature (for example De Lucia &\nBlaizot 2007; Von der Linden et al. 2007). For a small fraction of clusters, the BCG might not strictly be the brightest\ngalaxy in the cluster, but they are always the galaxy closer to\nthe X-ray peak. The sample selection, observations and data\nreduction procedures were detailed in Paper 1. In summary:\nthese 49 galaxies were classified as cD either in NED (in the\nmorphological classification or in the notes of previous ob1\nservations) and/or have profiles breaking the r 4 law in the\nexternal parts. In addition, NGC4946 (an ordinary elliptical) and NGC6047 (an E/S0) were also observed with the\nsame observational set-up, and are included in this project\nas control galaxies.\nThe galaxies were observed on the WHT and Gemini\nNorth and South telescopes. In addition to the 41 BCGs described in Paper 1, long-slit spectra were obtained for eight\nmore BCGs with Gemini South in the 2007B (July 2007 to\nJanuary 2008) observing semester. Thus, 49 BCGs were observed in total (for details of these galaxies see table 1, Paper\n1). The instrumental set-up and data reduction procedure\nfor the Gemini South 2007B observations were the same as\nused for the data taken in the previous semesters. The data\nreduction procedures are described in Paper 1 and will not\nbe repeated here.\nTo analyse the central parts of the BCGs, we extracted\nspectra inside apertures of ae /8 along the slit. The effective\nre (1\u2212\u01eb)\n,\nhalf-light radius was calculated as ae = 1\u2212\u01eb |cos(|P\nA\u2212M A|)|\nwith \u01eb the ellipticity (data from NED), re the radius containing half the light of the galaxy (computed from the\n2MASS K-band 20th magnitude arcsec\u22122 isophotal radius\nas described in Paper 1), PA the slit position axis, and MA\nthe major axis. For old stellar populations, these half-light\nradii do not differ much from those derived using the optical bands (Jarrett et al. 2003). The central values are for\n\n3\n\nan aperture of 1 \u00d7 ae /8 arcsec2 for the WHT data and\n0.5 \u00d7 ae /8 arcsec2 for the Gemini data, as the slit widths\nwere 1 and 0.5 arcsec, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratios per \u00c5 around the H\u03b2 region of the central spectra ranged\nbetween 16 (ESO541-013) and 502 (NGC1399), with an average of 87. The central kinematics used in the present paper\nare taken from our BCG kinematic study in Paper 1 (table\n4).\n2.1\n\nTransformation to the Lick/IDS system\n\nA widely used set of spectral absorption indices is the Lick\nsystem based on a large survey of individual stars in the\nsolar neighbourhood carried out with the image dissecting\nscanner (IDS) at the Lick Observatory (Burstein et al. 1984;\nFaber et al. 1985; Gorgas et al. 1993; Worthey et al. 1994).\nThe original Lick system consisted of 21 indices from CN1 , at\n\u223c 4150 \u00c5, to TiO2 , at \u223c 6230 \u00c5 (Faber et al. 1985; Worthey\n1994; Trager et al. 1998). Worthey & Ottaviani (1997) later\ncontributed four more indices centred on the Balmer lines\nH\u03b4 and H\u03b3. This collection of 25 indices will be referred to as\nthe Lick indices in this study. The advantages of using this\nset of indices are: they are well calibrated against globular\nclusters; the indices are not affected by dust (MacArthur\n2005); and their sensitivity to different chemical elements\nhave been calculated using model atmospheres (Tripicco &\nBell 1995; Korn, Maraston & Thomas 2005).\nLine strength indices depend on the broadening of lines\ncaused by the velocity dispersion of the galaxies and the\ninstrumental resolution. In order to use model predictions\nbased on the Lick/IDS system, spectra need to be degraded\nto the wavelength dependent resolution of the Lick/IDS\nspectrograph and indices need to be corrected for the broadening caused by the velocity dispersion of the galaxies. This\nhas been done using the prescriptions of Worthey & Ottaviani (1997). The detailed procedure follows in Appendix\nA.\n2.2\n\nEmission correction\n\nThe presence of emission lines leads to problems in analysing\nthe absorption lines in stellar populations. Key absorption\nindices like H\u03b2, H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 suffer from emission line infilling. Fe5015 is also affected by [OIII]\u03bb50071 emission,\nwhile Mgb is affected by [NI]\u03bb5199 emission. In the case of\nthe Balmer lines, emission fill-in can weaken the line strength\nand lead to older derived ages.\nTo measure the emission-line fluxes of the BCGs in\nthis study, the gandalf routine (Sarzi et al. 2006) was\nused. This software treats the emission lines as additional\nGaussian templates, and solves linearly at each step for\ntheir amplitudes and the optimal combination of stellar\ntemplates, which are convolved by the best stellar line-ofsight velocity distribution. The stellar continuum and emission lines are fitted simultaneously. The stellar templates\nused were based on the MILES stellar library (S\u00e1nchezBl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006d). The [OIII]\u03bb5007 line was fitted first.\nWhere H\u03b2 emission was relatively weak, the kinematics of\n1\n\nThe standard notation is used, where the spectral identification\nis written between two square brackets for forbidden lines.\n\n\f4\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of emission line correction of NGC6166.\nThe original spectrum is plotted over the emission-corrected spectrum with the affected indices (H\u03b2 and Fe5015) and their sidebands indicated. The H\u03b2 and [OIII]\u03bb\u03bb4958, 5007 emission lines\nare also indicated by vertical lines.\n\nFigure 2. Diagnostic diagram using emission lines to separate\nstar forming galaxies from AGN. Star forming galaxies are below\nthe line (given by Lamareille et al. 2004).\n\nall the other lines were tied to [OIII]\u03bb5007, following the\nprocedure described in Sarzi et al. (2006). This was done\nto avoid any spurious detections of H\u03b2 lines that might\nhave been caused by the presence of a number of metal\nfeatures around 4870 \u00c5. However, in cases were H\u03b2 was\nstrong enough to measure its kinematics, this was calculated independently as there is no a priori reason to expect\nthe kinematics measured from the [OIII]\u03bb5007 and H\u03b2 lines\nto be the same (as they can originate in different regions).\nThis procedure was used in order to derive the best-fitting\nemission-line spectrum in the galaxies where emission was\ndetected, and enables us to derive a purely-stellar spectrum\nfor these galaxies. The spectra of ESO349-010, MCG-02-12039, NGC0541, NGC1713, NGC3311, NGC4874, NGC4946,\nNGC6166, NGC6173, NGC7012, NGC7649, NGC7720 and\nPGC044257 have detectable emission lines. For these galaxies, a purely-stellar spectrum was derived by subtracting the\nbest-fitting emission-line spectrum from the observed one.\nFigure 1 shows the H\u03b2 region of the spectrum of NGC6166\nbefore and after the emission line correction.\nEmission lines originate from the hot ionised gas in the\ngalaxies which can indicate an active galaxy (such as AGN,\nLINER) or active star formation in the galaxy. We could\nnot measure [NII]\u03bb6584 or H\u03b1, as they were outside our\nwavelength range. Therefore, we use the diagnostic diagram\n[OIII]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 against [OII]\u03bb3727/H\u03b2 to separate the two\n\nmajor origins of emission: star formation and AGN (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich 1981; Lamareille et al. 2004). Figure 2 shows the galaxies for which the H\u03b2, [OII]\u03bb3727 and\n[OIII]\u03bb5007 lines could be measured (within at least 2\u03c3 detections) on the diagnostic plot.\nAll nine emission-line galaxies in the present work for\nwhich these three lines could be measured should be star\nforming galaxies according to this test. BCGs are known to\nbe more likely to host radio-loud AGN than any other galaxy\nwith the same stellar mass (Burns 1990; Best et al. 2007).\nThis is especially true if they are hosted by cooling-flow\nclusters (Burns et al. 1997). However, Best et al. (2007) argue that radio-loud AGN and emission-line AGN (detectable\nthrough optical emission lines) are independent, unrelated\nphenomena. Edwards et al. (2007) found, in their sample of\nBCGs, that the emission was mostly LINER-like or a combination of LINER and star formation, and concluded that\nthis emission was directly related to the cooling of X-ray\ngas at the cluster centre. Von der Linden et al. (2007) found\nemission lines in more than 50 per cent of their sample, although the four lines that they used as a diagnostic could\nonly be measured with a S/N > 3 in 30 per cent of their\nsample. From this subsample, only six per cent were star\nforming galaxies, 70 per cent LINERs and 24 per cent composite objects (star forming and LINER).\nBecause the diagnostic diagram used here in Figure 2 is\nmuch less effective at separating different sources of ionisation (Stasi\u0144ska et al. 2006), and because the fraction of the\ncurrent sample containing emission lines is relatively small,\nand with weak emission lines, it is too early to draw detailed\nconclusions about the nature of emission lines in BCGs.\n\n3\n\nCENTRAL BCG INDICES\n\nWe measured line-strength indices from the flux-calibrated\nspectra and calculated the index errors according to the error equations presented in Cardiel et al. (1998b), Vazdekis\n& Arimoto (1999) and Cenarro et al. (2001).\nThe wavelength coverage allowed us to measure all the\nLick indices, with the exception of TiO2 for most galaxies (and in a few cases also TiO1 ) in the Gemini data and\nfive indices of NGC6047 (Mg1 to Fe5335). TiO1 is very\nclose to the edge of the spectrum and therefore not reliable. On very close inspection, five galaxies (Leda094683,\nNGC7649, NGC6166, PGC025714 and PGC030223) showed\neither residuals of sky line removal or residuals where the\ngaps in between the GMOS CCDs were inside the band definitions of the indices used to derive the SSP parameters,\nhence they were also excluded from any further analysis using those indices.\nThe derived errors on the indices take the Poisson and\nsystematic errors (flux calibration effects; velocity dispersion corrections; sky subtraction uncertainties; wavelength\ncalibration and radial velocity errors) into account. We do\nnot take into account the errors derived on the offsets to\ntransform the indices to the Lick system (shown in Table\nA1). The central index measurements compared very well\nwith previous measurements from the literature, as shown\nin Appendix B.\nLick offsets are applied to correct measurements that\nwere flux-calibrated using the spectrophotometric system to\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Central index measurements against velocity dispersion. The straight lines fitted to the BCG data are in red. The blue lines\ndenote the relations found for the SB06 elliptical sample in the same mass range, and the green line the relations for the complete SB06\nelliptical sample (high and low density samples combined).\n\nthe Lick/IDS system and, therefore, should be identical for\nall flux-calibrated studies. Thus, we compare our derived\noffsets with other sources to test the robustness of the Lick\ntransformation. The Lick offsets derived here for the Gemini\ndata were compared to independently derived offsets from\nthe same Lick star dataset (M. Norris, private communica-\n\ntion), as described in Appendix A. Most of the offsets are in\nagreement, with the exception of C2 4668 and Ca4455 which\nare marginally higher in this study. Since the BCG data are\nbeing compared with SB06 (Section 3.1), the Lick offsets\nwere also compared. All the Lick offsets agree within the errors, and no real outliers were found. As a final test, we also\n\n\f6\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure 4. Central index measurements against velocity dispersion. The lines are as in Figure 3.\n\ncompare our offsets with the offsets derived by comparing\nall the stars in common between the flux-calibrated MILES\nlibrary (S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006d; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et\nal. 2009) and the Lick/IDS library. Any remaining systematics would not have been corrected by the usual Lick calibration offsets, as the systematic would have had a different\neffect on stars and on galaxies (at different redshifts).\n\n3.1\n\nResults: Index \u2013 velocity dispersion relations\n\nFollowing various other authors, and to compare with\nS\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. (2006a, hereafter SB06), the atomic\nindices will be expressed in magnitudes when correlated\nwith the velocity dispersion. These will be denoted by the\nname followedh by a primei sign, and were obtained using\nI\nIMag = 2.5 log (\u03bb1Ang\n+ 1 , where the wavelength range is\n\u2212\u03bb2 )\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 in the central bandpass, and IAng and IMag are the\nindex measurement in \u00c5 and magnitudes respectively.\nStraight line fits (I \u2032 = a + b \u00d7 log \u03c3) were made to the\nBCG data with a least-squares fitting routine, and are shown\nin Figures 3 and 4 and given in Table 1. Statistical t-tests\nwere run to explore the presence of correlations. Only six out\nof 18 indices possess a statistically significant slope different\nfrom zero (as can be seen from Table 1). These are Ca4227,\nH\u03b3F , Ca4455, Fe4531, C2 4668 and Mgb .\nThe scatter in the CN1 , CN2 , Mg1 , Mg2 , NaD and TiO1\nindices were found to be large. The molecular indices are\nknown to show only a small amounts of scatter, but are frequently affected by flux calibration uncertainties, since the\nindex definitions span a broad wavelength range. For 15 of\nthe indices plotted, the index\u2013velocity dispersion relations\nfound by SB06 for a large sample of elliptical galaxies are\nalso indicated. The complete SB06 sample consists of 98\n\ngalaxies, of which 35 belong to the Coma cluster, and the\nrest are galaxies in the field, in groups or in the Virgo cluster.\nTwo relations per index were derived by SB06: one for ellipticals in a higher density environment, and one for ellipticals\nin a lower density environment. Here, both the higher and\nlower density samples are combined for comparison with the\nBCG data, since some of the BCGs are in Virgo-equivalent\nenvironments. As mentioned in Appendix B, five galaxies\nwere in common with SB06. Four of those are in the higher\ndensity sample and one in the lower density sample. The\nBCG data are spread over a narrower range in velocity dispersion (log \u03c3 = 2.3 to 2.6 km s\u22121 ) than the SB06 sample\n(log \u03c3 = 1.4 to 2.6 km s\u22121 ), which meant that their slopes\ncould possibly be heavily influenced by the lower velocity\ndispersion galaxies. The velocity dispersion distributions of\nthe two samples are shown in Figure 5. We performed a\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test on the velocity dispersion distributions of the two samples within the log \u03c3 = 2.3 to 2.6\nkm s\u22121 range, where the null hypothesis is that the distributions were drawn from an identical parent population.\nWithin this limited range, the two velocity dispersion distributions are consistent (the test value is 0.260, where a test\nvalue larger than D = 0.290 indicates that the two samples\ncompared are significantly different from each other at the\n95 per cent confidence level). New relationships between the\nindices and velocity dispersion were derived for the SB06\nsample to compare with the BCG data, only including the\nelliptical galaxies in the same mass range and excluding the\nfive known BCGs. These new relations and their errors, derived using a subsample of 45 galaxies from SB06, are given\nin Table 1. Two relations derived for the SB06 sample are\nshown in Figures 3 and 4: the relation found for the SB06 elliptical sample in the same mass range (blue line), as well as\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\n\nFigure 5. The velocity dispersion distributions of the complete\nSB06 (red) and the BCG sample (cyan). The vertical line indicates the lower limit in velocity dispersion (log \u03c3 = 2.3 km s\u22121 )\nof the SB06 subsample used here for comparison.\n\nthe relation for the complete SB06 elliptical sample (green\nline). Both lines are for the high and low density samples\ncombined.\nMost of the fitted relations agree with those of elliptical galaxies. The only indices where a notable difference\nis detected are G4300, Ca4455 and C2 4668 where the zero\npoints of the BCG data are higher than for the SB06 elliptical data. For Ca4455 and C2 4668, this is explained by the\noffsets applied to the data to transform it onto the Lick system. But, this does not explain the discrepancy in the G4300\nindex. Thus, there are no significant discrepancies between\nthe index\u2013velocity dispersion relations of the BCG data and\nthat of normal ellipticals in the same mass range, with the\nexception of G4300.\nWe calculate the intrinsic scatter (not explained by the\nerrors) for both the BCGs and the SB06 elliptical sample in\nthe mass range considered here. All the indices, for which\nthe intrinsic scatter around the slope could be calculated\nfor both samples, showed that the BCGs are intrinsically\nmore scattered than the ellipticals (column 5 compared to\ncolumn 6 in Table 2). This might indicate that the BCGs are\nmore affected by properties other than mass, than elliptical\ngalaxies over this mass range.\n\n4\n\nDERIVATION OF\nLUMINOSITY-WEIGHTED PROPERTIES\n\nTo calculate the ages, metallicities ([Z/H]), and \u03b1enhancement ratios ([E/Fe]), we compare our derived linestrength indices with the predictions of Thomas, Maraston\n& Bender (2003) and Thomas, Maraston & Korn (2004).\nThese models are based on the evolutionary population synthesis models of Maraston (1998; 2005). Variations of the\nindices with chemical partitions departing from solar are\ncomputed with the Tripicco & Bell (1995) and Korn et al.\n(2005) model atmospheres, with a slightly modified method\nfrom the one presented by Trager et al. (2000a). The models\nare presented for six different metallicities [Z/H] = \u22122.25,\n\u22121.35, \u22120.33, 0.0, 0.35, 0.67, ages between 1 and 15 Gyr,\nevenly spaced in logarithmic steps of 0.025, and [E/Fe] =\n0.0, 0.3 and 0.5.

We started by interpolating the model\ngrids in increments of 0.05 in [Z/H] and [E/Fe] and 0.1 dex\nin age. Then we applied a \u03c72 technique to find the combination of SSP that best reproduced the four indices simultaneously. Errors in the parametres were calculated performing\n50 Monte\u2013Carlo simulations in which, each time, the indices\nwere displaced by an amount given by a Gaussian probability distribution with a width equal to the errors on these\nindices.\nAll SSP parameter results are shown in Table 3. The\nerrors for the galaxy PGC026269 are unusually high and,\ntherefore, this galaxy is excluded from further analysis.\nAs mentioned before, five galaxies (Leda094683, NGC7649,\nNGC6166, PGC025714 and PGC030223) showed sky line or\n2\n\nWhere <Fe> is defined as (Fe5270 + Fe5335)/2 (Gonz\u00e1lez\n1993).\n\n\f8\n\nLoubser et al.\nIndex\na \u00b1 std err(a)\n\u2032\n\nH\u03b4A\n\u2032\n\nH\u03b4F\n\n\u2032\n\nCa4227\n\u2032\n\nG4300\n\u2032\nH\u03b3A\n\u2032\nH\u03b3F\n\n\u2032\n\nFe4383\n\n\u2032\n\nCa4455\n\n\u2032\n\nFe4531\n\n\u2032\n\nC2 4668\nH\u03b2\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\nFe5015\n\u2032\n\nMgb\n\n\u2032\n\nFe5270\n\n\u2032\n\nFe5335\n\n\u2032\n\nFe5406\n\n\u2032\n\nFe5709\n\n\u2032\n\nFe5782\n\nBCG Galaxies\nb \u00b1 std err(b)\nt\n\nMean \u00b1 std err\n\nP\n\nEllipticals\na \u00b1 std err(a)\nb \u00b1 std err(b)\n\n0.0598\u00b10.0903\n\n\u20130.0620\u00b10.0368\n\n1.687\n\n0.098\n\n\u20130.093\u00b10.020\n\n0.184\u00b10.016\n\n\u20130.102\u00b10.007\n\n0.0280\u00b10.0592\n\n\u20130.0145\u00b10.0241\n\n0.603\n\n0.550\n\n\u20130.008\u00b10.016\n\n0.251\u00b10.018\n\n\u20130.102\u00b10.008\n\n\u20130.0700\u00b10.0681\n\n0.0800\u00b10.0277\n\n2.887\n\n0.006\n\n0.127\u00b10.016\n\n\u20130.044\u00b10.015\n\n0.059\u00b10.007\n\n0.0973\u00b10.0500\n\n0.0385\u00b10.0204\n\n1.893\n\n0.065\n\n0.192\u00b10.011\n\n0.152\u00b10.016\n\n0.008\u00b10.007\n\n\u20130.0261\u00b10.0669\n\n\u20130.0479\u00b10.0272\n\n1.758\n\n0.085\n\n\u20130.144\u00b10.015\n\n0.009\u00b10.017\n\n\u20130.060\u00b10.007\n\n0.0991\u00b10.0746\n\n\u20130.0781\u00b10.0304\n\n2.570\n\n0.013\n\n\u20130.093\u00b10.017\n\n0.135\u00b10.023\n\n\u20130.086\u00b10.010\n\n0.1403\u00b10.0950\n\n\u20130.0091\u00b10.0387\n\n0.235\n\n0.815\n\n0.118\u00b10.020\n\n0.014\u00b10.008\n\n0.042\u00b10.003\n\n\u20130.0826\u00b10.0843\n\n0.0735\u00b10.0343\n\n2.142\n\n0.037\n\n0.098\u00b10.019\n\n\u20130.049\u00b10.009\n\n0.053\u00b10.004\n0.025\u00b10.002\n\n\u20130.0140\u00b10.0460\n\n0.0424\u00b10.0187\n\n2.266\n\n0.028\n\n0.090\u00b10.010\n\n0.027\u00b10.005\n\n\u20130.0985\u00b10.0334\n\n0.0859\u00b10.0136\n\n6.317\n\n<0.001\n\n0.113\u00b10.009\n\n\u20130.103\u00b10.011\n\n0.083\u00b10.005\n\n0.0754\u00b10.0327\n\n\u20130.0060\u00b10.0133\n\n0.448\n\n0.656\n\n0.061\u00b10.001\n\n0.100\u00b10.012\n\n\u20130.018\u00b10.005\n\n0.0035\u00b10.0413\n\n0.0306\u00b10.0168\n\n1.819\n\n0.075\n\n0.079\u00b10.010\n\n\u20130.018\u00b10.013\n\n0.039\u00b10.006\n\n0.0405\u00b10.0606\n\n0.0588\u00b10.0247\n\n2.383\n\n0.021\n\n0.185\u00b10.014\n\n\u20130.169\u00b10.015\n\n0.140\u00b10.007\n\n0.0738\u00b10.0396\n\n0.0041\u00b10.0161\n\n0.253\n\n0.801\n\n0.084\u00b10.008\n\n0.029\u00b10.007\n\n0.023\u00b10.003\n\n0.0128\u00b10.0632\n\n0.0281\u00b10.0257\n\n1.093\n\n0.280\n\n0.082\u00b10.014\n\n0.030\u00b10.009\n\n0.021\u00b10.004\n\n0.0545\u00b10.0913\n\n0.0084\u00b10.0372\n\n0.225\n\n0.823\n\n0.075\u00b10.019\n\n0.1109\u00b10.0401\n\n\u20130.0291\u00b10.0163\n\n1.783\n\n0.081\n\n0.040\u00b10.009\n\n0.0877\u00b10.0517\n\n\u20130.0171\u00b10.0210\n\n0.812\n\n0.421\n\n0.046\u00b10.011\n\nTable 1.

If\na galaxy has experienced a more complicated SFH than a\nsingle burst of star formation, then the age derived here will\nbe biased towards the age of the younger stars and not the\ndominating stellar populations by mass (Li & Han 2007).\nOn the other hand, the SSP-metallicity will be more biased\nto the metallicity of the old population, depending on the\nmass fraction of the burst (Serra & Trager 2007; S\u00e1nchezBl\u00e1zquez et al. 2007). Thus, the derived age should not be\ninterpreted as the time that passed since formation of most\nstars in that galaxy. However, Balmer-line based ages allow us to detect minor amounts of recent star formation in\ngenerally old galaxies. Several authors (Maraston et al. 2003;\nTrager et al. 2005) pointed out that another complication to\nthe age and metallicity analysis of non-star forming galaxies is the possible presence of hot populations of stars not\nincluded in the models (such as blue stragglers and horizontal branch stars). However, Trager et al. (2005) showed that\nthese stars affect the inferred metallicities more than ages.\nFigure 7 shows the age, [Z/H] and [E/Fe] distributions\nfor our sample of BCGs. We compare the observed scatter\nwith that expected from the errors (see Table 4) to investigate if the distributions are compatible with a single value\nof age, [Z/H] and [E/Fe] for all the BCGs. We found that,\nwhile the errors in the age explain the observed scatter, the\nscatter in [Z/H] and [E/Fe] is much larger, possibly indicating a real variation in the mean stellar abundances of these\ngalaxies.\n4.1\n\nSSP-equivalent parameters: comparison with\nellipticals\n\nSeveral authors have found a decreasing amount of scatter\nin the age and metallicity parameters with increasing velocity dispersion for early-type galaxies (Caldwell et al. 2003;\nNelan et al. 2005; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006b).

Is this\nalso true for the galaxies in the centre of the clusters?\nFigure 7 compares the distribution of SSP-equivalent\nparameters with that of ordinary ellipticals from Thomas et\nal. (2005 \u2013 T05 hereafter) and SB06. To avoid artificial offsets between samples due the use of different techniques to\ncalculate the SSP-parameters, we recalculated these parameters using exactly the same indices and method as used for\nour sample of BCGs. Nevertheless, small offsets can remain\ndue the use of different apertures. The T05 central indices\nwere measured within 1/10 of the effective radius, and the\nSB06 indices within an equivalent aperture of 4\" at a redshift of z = 0.016. The uncertainties in assuming gradients to\nperform these aperture corrections are large because of the\ngreat variety of gradients found for elliptical galaxies. These\ngradients seem to be uncorrelated with other galaxy properties, such as mass, and mean gradients are usually calculated\n(S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2009). For the samples used here,\nwhich all contain nearby galaxies, these aperture differences\nproduce a negligible effect in the indices, and hence, given\nthe uncertainties in the aperture corrections, these corrections were not applied here. From the T05 and SB06 studies,\nwe select those galaxies with central velocity dispersions between log \u03c3 = 2.3 and 2.6 km s\u22121 to match the same range\nas in our BCGs. We also excluded their known BCGs (four\nin T05 and five in SB06). This left subsamples of 65 and 45\nelliptical galaxies from T05 and SB06, respectively.\n\n\f10\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nlog (age)\n[Z/H]\n[E/Fe]\n\nBCGs\ncompared to\nSB06\nD = 0.290\n\nBCGs\ncompared to\nT05\nD = 0.267\n\nSB06\ncompared to\nT05\nD = 0.264\n\n0.197\n0.378\n0.440\n\n0.236\n0.390\n0.560\n\n0.097\n0.203\n0.122\n\nTable 5.

The critical value of theqstatistical test, at a 95 per\n\nm+n\ncent confidence level, is D = 1.36 m\u00d7n\n, where m and n are\nthe number of galaxies in the sample. Thus, if the test value is\nlarger than D (given in the heading of the table for the three different comparisons), then the samples compared are significantly\ndifferent from each other at a 95 per cent confidence level.\n\nSystematic differences were detected between the two\nsamples of ordinary elliptical galaxies. The T05 and SB06\nsamples used here have 19 galaxies in common. In addition,\nthe three Coma BCGs (NGC4839, NGC4874 and NGC4889)\nform part of the BCG sample and the original T05 and SB06\nsamples. Thus, offsets in H\u03b2, Mgb and <Fe> could be derived between the two samples of elliptical galaxies used.\nThe indices of the three Coma BCGs measured here were in\nbetter agreement with the measurements from SB06 than\nfrom T05. For example, the average difference between the\nH\u03b2 measurements was 0.064 \u00c5 compared to the SB06 sample and 0.35 \u00c5 compared to the T05 sample. Thus, the following offsets in the indices (derived using the galaxies in\ncommon) were applied to the data from T05: H\u03b2 \u20130.158\n\u00c5; Mgb \u20130.139; <Fe> +0.013 before the derivation of the\nSSP parameters. This normalisation placed the two elliptical samples in very good agreement, as confirmed by a\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (see the last column of Table 5,\ndescribed below).\nWe explore possible differences in the distributions of\nthe SSP-parameters derived for BCGs and elliptical galaxies by performing a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test on the three\nsamples (see Table 5), where the null hypothesis is that the\ndistributions were drawn from an identical parent population. We comment on the results in the following paragraphs.\nAge: As can be seen in Figure 7, and confirmed in Table\n5, the peaks and dispersions of the age distributions of all\nthree samples coincide. Nevertheless, the BCG age distribution show a second, smaller peak at log (age) \u223c 0.65, which\nalthough not statistically significant, is absent in the elliptical galaxy distributions.\nMetallicity: The models provide an estimate of [Z/H]\nwhich includes all the elements heavier than H and He. The\ndistribution of the BCG metallicities peaks at a higher value\n(average [Z/H] = 0.31 \u00b1 0.17) than the ordinary ellipticals\n(average SB06 [Z/H] = 0.24 \u00b1 0.13; T05 [Z/H] = 0.21 \u00b1\n0.13). Table 5 confirms that the BCG metallicity distribution is significantly different from both elliptical samples.\n\u03b1-enhancement: The [E/Fe] ratio is often used as an indicator for the time-scales of star formation (Worthey, Faber\n& Gonz\u00e1lez 1992; Trager 2006), as it serves as a crude estimation of the ratio of SNII to SNIa. The high values of\n\n[E/Fe] detected in massive early-type galaxies has been commonly interpreted in terms of star formation time-scales, i.e.\nthe star formation stop before SNIa have time to contribute\nsignificantly with their products (Tinsley 1980). However,\na high [E/Fe] can also be the consequence of differences in\nthe initial mass function (IMF) where it is skewed towards\nmassive stars, differences in the binary fractions, or to selective winds that drive most of the Fe-group elements to the\nintracluster medium.\nFigure 7 shows that the BCG sample has slightly higher\n\u03b1-enhancement values (average BCG [E/Fe] = 0.41 \u00b1 0.09;\nSB06 [E/Fe] = 0.30 \u00b1 0.10; T05 [E/Fe] = 0.33 \u00b1 0.06).\nTable 5 confirms that the BCG \u03b1-enhancement distribution\nis significantly different from both elliptical samples.\nThis result agrees with that of Von der Linden et al.\n(2007), who studied brightest group and cluster galaxies in\nthe SDSS. They found that at the same stellar mass, the\nstellar populations of BCGs and non-BCGs are similar with\nthe exception of their \u03b1-element enhancement ratios, which\nwere found to be higher in BCGs. These authors interpret\ntheir results in terms of star formation time-scales (star formation occurring in shorter time-scales in the BCGs than\nin ellipticals), but it is possible that other mechanisms, related to the cluster environment and the privileged position\nof BCGs are acting to influence their chemical abundances\nratios. Other scenarios causing higher [E/Fe] values such as\ndifferences in the IMF, or in the binary fractions, or selective\nwinds cannot be conclusively eliminated.\n\n5\n\nCORRELATION BETWEEN KINEMATICS\nAND DERIVED PROPERTIES\n\nRecent studies have shown that the lack of rotation found\nin massive ellipticals is compatible with the idea that these\nobjects formed through dissipationless mergers (e.g. Naab &\nBurkert 2003; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2006). The remnants left\nby mergers with or without dissipation are expected to differ in their kinematical structure. For example, in a merger\nwhere dissipationless processes dominate, the remnant will\nshow little or no rotation, whereas rotation is expected in\nremnants left by mergers involving gas (Paper 1, and references therein). In Paper 1, we showed that our sample of\nBCGs have great variety in their kinematical and dynamical\nproperties, and that a number of BCGs show clear rotation\ncontrary to what is expected if all BCGs formed by radial\naccretion of satellites without gas. If rotating BCGs are the\nconsequence of dissipational mergers, and these happened\nrelatively recently, we would expect younger ages for these\nsystems. As numerical simulations have shown, when the gas\nis present in merging systems, it is very effectively funnelled\ntoward the centre of the remant where star formation occurs\n(e.g. Mihos & Hernquist 1994).\nFigure 8 shows the anisotropy parameters (where Vmax\nis half the difference between the peaks of the rotation curve)\nof the BCGs for which major axis spectra were observed\nagainst the ages. No real difference is visible in the ages\nof rotating and non-rotating galaxies, and a whole range of\nages were found for galaxies showing a lack of rotation. In\nfact, the two galaxies rotating the fastest are amongst the\noldest in our sample.\nFigure 9 shows the derived SSP-parameters log (age),\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\n\n11\n\nFigure 9.

To\ntest for the presence of correlations, linear relations of the\nform P = a + b \u00d7 log \u03c3 were fitted to the BCG data and\nt-tests were performed to test the null hypothesis b = 0 (see\nTable 6). The t and P values have the same meaning as previously (in Table 1). The relations derived for the BCG data\nare compared with those derived for the ordinary elliptical\ngalaxy samples of T05 (red line) and SB06 (green line) in\nFigure 9. The SSP-parameters of the elliptical samples were\nrecalculated using H\u03b2, Mgb , Fe5270 and Fe5335 with the\nKMT models in exactly the same way as for the BCG data.\nIt can be seen in Figure 9 and Table 6 that we do\nnot find significant relations between the derived SSPparameters and the velocity dispersions in our sample of\n\n\f12\n\nLoubser et al.\n\ngalaxies, although the slopes are similar to that of normal\nelliptical galaxies over the same mass range. This result, in\nprinciple, contrasts with the relationships obtained for normal elliptical galaxies, for which several authors have found\nan increase in the mean age with the velocity dispersion\n(Thomas et al. 2005; Nelan et al. 2005; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et\nal. 2006b). However, the mass range spanned by our sample is too narrow to be able to see the differences. Even\nif the BCG were simply the extension towards the massive\nend of normal elliptical galaxies, we would not be able to detect significant correlations in this mass range. Indeed, there\nare virtually no difference between the relationship obtained\nfor the BCGs and those for the two normal elliptical samples shown in Figure 9. Several authors have also found the\nexistence of a positive correlation between the degree of \u03b1enhancement in the central parts of early-type galaxies and\nvelocity dispersion (Worthey et al. 1992; Kuntschner 2000;\nTrager et al. 2000b; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2007), which is\nnot visible here because of the narrow mass range. Figure 9\nagain shows that the BCGs have, on average, higher [E/Fe]\nvalues than the ellipticals.\nWe also investigated the possibility of correlations with\nthe SSP-parameters when the total magnitude is used instead of velocity dispersion. None of the derived parameters\nshow a potential correlation with K-band magnitudes from\n2MASS, and this was not investigated further.\nOther correlations: age\u2013metallicity\nA strong age\u2013metallicity anti-correlation was found for the\nBCG sample, but is likely to be an artifact of the degeneracy\nbetween age and metallicity since the errors on these stellar\npopulation parameters are not independent (Kuntschner et\nal. 2001). To check this for the present study, 50 Monte\u2013\nCarlo simulations were performed. The mean values of the\nindices were taken and moved randomly using a Gaussian\ndistribution with a width equal to the typical error on the\nindices. The ages and metallicities were then derived with\nthe same procedure used for the BCG data. The differences\nbetween the BCG data and the simulated data are marginal\nin both the slope of the best-fitting correlation as well as\nthe standard deviation from the relation. Thus, the age\u2013\nmetallicity anti-correlation can almost entirely be explained\nby the correlation of the errors on the parameters. Table\n4 also showed that there is no intrinsic scatter (other than\nexpected from the errors) in the ages derived for the BCGs,\nwhereas the metallicities do show inherent scatter.\n\n6\n\nCONTEXT OF THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nHierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the formation of the central galaxy is closely connected with the\nevolution of the host cluster. In principle, this would not\nnecessarily be reflected by differences in the SFH, as stars\nmight have formed before the formation \u2013 or assembly \u2013\nof the real galaxy. However, it is interesting to investigate\nwhether, and to what extent, the characteristics of the host\ncluster influence the stellar populations of the BCG.\nThe X-ray properties of the host clusters are given in\nTable 7. All the X-ray luminosity and temperature (LX and\nTX ) values are from spectra observed in the 0.1 \u2013 2.4 keV\n\nFigure 10. Velocity dispersion for the BCGs plotted against log\nLX for the host clusters.\n\nband, and using the same cosmology namely H0 = 50 km\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.\n6.1\n\nVelocity dispersion \u2013 log LX\n\nCluster X-ray luminosity is directly proportional to the\nsquare of the density of the intracluster medium and thus\nprovides a measure of environmental density (Reiprich &\nBohringer 2002). We do not find a correlation between the\nX-ray luminosities of the clusters (i.e. density of the cluster)\nand the velocity dispersions of the BCGs (i.e. the mass of\nthe BCG), as shown in Figure 10. Brough et al. (2007) noted\na weak trend (only 2\u03c3) between these two properties, in the\nsense that galaxies in higher density clusters are more massive. However, their sample consisted of only six galaxies. It\ncan be seen from Figure 10 that this correlation is not found\nwhen this much larger sample of BCGs is used. Nevertheless, it is well-known that BCG luminosity does correlate\nwith host cluster mass (Lin & Mohr 2004; Popesso et al.\n2006; Hansen et al. 2007; Whiley et al. 2008).\n6.2\n\nIndices \u2013 log LX\n\nFigure 11 shows the relations of some of the central Lick/IDS\nindices measured in our sample of BCGs with the host cluster X-ray luminosity. We do not find any significant correlation for any of the indices. However, the plots of the Balmer\nlines against X-ray luminosity seem to suggest a break in the\nrelationships at log LX \u223c 44 erg s\u22121 . For low-LX clusters,\nBalmer-line strengths seem to increase with X-ray luminosity. However, for clusters with X-ray luminosity greater than\nlog LX \u223c 44 erg s\u22121 , this trend seems to reverse (with the\nexception of the most dense cluster). However, this is a weak\ntrend, and not confirmed by the relationship between the derived age with cluster X-ray luminosity (not shown here). As\ndiscussed in the introduction, previous photometric studies\nreported different evolutionary histories in X-ray bright and\ndim clusters. Brough et al. (2002) places this break at LX =\n1.9 \u00d71044 erg s\u22121 , and conclude that BCGs in high-LX clusters assemble their mass at z > 1 and have been passively\nevolving since, whereas BCGs in low-LX clusters appear to\nbe in the process of assembling their mass. Figure 11 suggests two different regimes in the cluster X-ray luminosity\nand the BCG line strengths, but this is not conclusive due\nto the scatter and large errors on the measurements.\nHost cluster velocity dispersion data were also collected\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\nGalaxy\n\nESO146-028\nESO202-043\nESO303-005\nESO346-003\nESO349-010\nESO444-046\nESO488-027\nESO541-013\nESO552-020\nGSC555700266\nIC1101\nIC1633\nIC4765\nIC5358\nLeda094683\nMCG-02-12-039\nNGC0533\nNGC0541\nNGC1399\nNGC1713\nNGC2832\nNGC3311\nNGC3842\nNGC4839\nNGC4874\nNGC4889\nNGC4946\nNGC6034\nNGC6047\nNGC6086\nNGC6160\nNGC6166\nNGC6173\nNGC6269\nNGC7012\nNGC7597\nNGC7647\nNGC7649\nNGC7720\nNGC7768\nPGC004072\nPGC025714\nPGC026269\nPGC030223\nPGC044257\nPGC071807\nPGC072804\nUGC00579\nUGC02232\nUGC05515\nUGC10143\n\nCluster\n\nRXCJ2228.8-6053\nA S0479\nRBS521\nA S1065\nA4059\nA3558\nA0548\nA0133\nCID 28\nA1837\nA2029\nA2877\nA S0805\nA4038\nA1809\nA0496\nA0189B\nA0194\nRBS454\nCID 27\nA0779\nA1060\nA1367\nA1656\nA1656\nA1656\nA3526\nA2151\nA2151\nA2162\nA2197\nA2199\nA2197\nAWM5\nA S0921\nA2572\nA2589\nA2593\nA2634\nA2666\nA0151\nA0754\nA0780\nA0978\nA1644\nA2622\nA2670\nA0119\nA0376\nA0957\nA2147\n\nLX \u00d7 1044\n(erg s\u22121 )\nref\n0.17\n\u2013\n0.79\n0.096\n2.80\u00b10.06\n6.56\u00b10.04\n0.21\n2.85\u00b10.04\n0.16\n1.28\n17.07\u00b10.18\n0.20\n0.03\n1.92\u00b10.04\n\u2013\n3.77\u00b10.05\n0.04\n0.14\n0.08\u00b10.01\n\u2013\n0.07\n0.56\u00b10.03\n1.20\u00b10.02\n\u2013\n8.09\u00b10.19\n8.09\u00b10.19\n1.19\u00b10.04\n0.98\n0.98\n\u2013\n0.13\n4.20\u00b10.12\n\u2013\n0.36\n\u2013\n0.58\n1.87\u00b10.04\n\u2013\n0.99\u00b10.03\n\u2013\n0.99\n3.97\u00b10.11\n5.61\n0.50\n3.92\u00b10.34\n\u2013\n2.70\n3.34\u00b10.05\n1.36\n0.81\n2.87\u00b10.15\n\nb\n\u2013\nb\nr\na\na\nb\na\nb\nb\na\nb\nb\na\n\u2013\na\nb\nb\na\n\u2013\nb\na\na\n\u2013\na\na\na\nc\nc\n\u2013\nc\na\n\u2013\nc\n\u2013\nc\na\n\u2013\na\n\u2013\nb\na\nb\nb\na\n\u2013\nb\na\nc\nb\na\n\nTX\n(keV)\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n3.5\n3.8\n2.4\n3.8\n\u2013\n2.4\n7.8\n3.5\n\u2013\n\u2013\n3.7\n4.7\n\u2013\n1.9\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1.5\n3.3\n3.5\n\u2013\n8.0\n8.0\n\u2013\n3.5\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1.6\n4.7\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n3.7\n3.1\n3.4\n1.6\n\u2013\n8.7\n\u2013\n\u2013\n4.7\n\u2013\n3.9\n5.1\n5.1\n2.9\n4.4\n\nCooling Flow\nref\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\n\u2013\nX\n\u2013\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\ne\ne\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\nw\n\u2013\nc\nw\nw,e\n\u2013\nw\nc\n\u2013\nw\nw\nw,e,g\n\u2013\ne,g\ne,g\n\u2013\ng\ng\ng\nw,g\nw,e,g\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\ne\nw\ne,g\ng\n\u2013\ne\ne\n\u2013\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw,e\ne\nw\ne,g\n\n\u03c3cluster\n(km s\u22121 )\nref\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n845\n986\n853\n767\n\u2013\n596\n786\n738\n\u2013\n891\n249\n705\n\u2013\n480\n240\n\u2013\n503\n608\n822\n\u2013\n1010\n1010\n\u2013\n827\n827\n323\n564\n794\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n676\n500\n690\n744\n476\n715\n747\n641\n498\n933\n942\n1038\n863\n903\n669\n1148\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nw\nw\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\nw\n\u2013\nm\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\n\u2013\nw\nw\ns\nw\nw\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nst\nw\nw\nw\nw\ns\nw\ne\nst\nw\ns\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\n\nRoff\n(Mpc)\n\n13\n\nref\n\n0.051\ncb\n\u2013\n\u2013\n0.010\ncb\n0.032\ncr\n0.019\ne\n0.019\ne\n\u22c6\ncb\n0.017\ne\n0.013\ncb\n0.020\ncb\n0.131\np\n0.015\ncb\n0.007\ncb\n0.002\ncb\n0.044\np\n0.031\ne\n0.004\ncb\n0.037\ncb\n< 0.001\ncb\n\u2013\n\u2013\n0.038\ncl\n0.015\npe\n0.252\ne\n\u22c6\n\u2013\n0.038\ncb\n0.169\ne\nnot BCG\n\u22c6\n\u2013\nnot BCG\n0.053\ncl\n0.017\ncc\n0.007\ne\n\u22c6\n\u2013\n0.002\ncc\n\u2013\n\u2013\n0.048\ncc\n0.073\ne\n0.020\ncl\n0.018\ne\n0.006\ncl\n0.006\ncb\n0.328\ne\n0.015\ne\n0.027\ncb\n0.009\npe\n0.249\ncc\n0.035\ncb\n0.054\ne\n0.136\ncc\n0.037\ncb\n0.082\ne\n\nTable 7.

Several studies reported examples of recent or ongoing star formation in BCGs hosted\nby cooling flow clusters (Cardiel et al. 1998a; Crawford et\nal. 1999; McNamara et al. 2006; Edwards et al. 2007; O'Dea\n\net al. 2008; Bildfell et al. 2008; Pipino et al. 2009). Cooling\nflow information was collected from the literature as shown\nin Table 7. Figure 12 shows the derived SSP-parameters\nagainst velocity dispersion for clusters with cooling flow or\nnon-cooling flow data available in the literature. For the six\nintermediate-aged galaxies (younger than \u223c 6 Gyr) for which\ncooling flow information is available, only one is hosted by a\ncluster without a cooling flow. Thus, there is a tendency that\nthe BCGs with younger mean ages tend to be in clusters with\ncooling flows, in agreement with the previous photometric\nresults by Bildfell et al. (2008).\nSeveral previous studies have shown that BCGs lie\n\n\f14\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure 11. Examples of indices against log LX for the BCGs.\n\nFigure 13.

The\nstraight line is the Faber\u2013Jackson relation for normal ellipticals\nThe bottom two plots show the deviation from the Faber\u2013Jackson\nrelation as a function of host cluster X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion (proxies for host cluster density and mass, respectively).\n\nFigure 12. The derived SSP-parameters against velocity dispersion for the BCGs. The blue symbols are BCGs in host clusters\nwith cooling flows, and the red symbols those in clusters without\ncooling flows.\n\nabove the Faber-Jackson relation (Faber & Jackson 1976)\ndefined by ordinary elliptical galaxies (Tonry 1984; Oegerle\n& Hoessel 1991; Bernardi et al. 2006; Desroches et al. 2007;\nLauer et al. 2007; Von der Linder et al. 2007). Figure 13\nshows the Faber\u2013Jackson relation for normal ellipticals, corresponding to L \u221d \u03c3 4 , and data points for BCGs in coolingflow and non-cooling flow clusters on the same graph. The\nlower panels in Figure 13 show the deviation from the Faber\u2013\nJackson relation against cluster X-ray luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion, respectively. No real difference can\nbe seen between the location of the cooling and non-cooling\nclusters on the relation (this is also the case if 2MASS Kmagnitudes are used). Hence, the presence of cooling flows in\nclusters does not affect the position of the BCG in this scaling relationship. This is to be expected, as the deviation from\nthe Faber\u2013Jackson relation by BCGs is naturally explained\nby models of dissipationless mergers of elliptical galaxies,\nprovided that the merger orbits become preferentially more\nradial for the most massive galaxies (Boylan-Kolchin et al.\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\n2006). Hence, this deviation is not related to the presence\nof cooling flows in the cluster centre.\nOf the nine emission-line galaxies in this sample for\nwhich cooling-flow information is available (see Table 7),\nfive are hosted by clusters with cooling flows and four are\nhosted by clusters without cooling flows. Edwards et al.\n(2007) found that the frequency of BCGs showing optical\nemission lines in their sample increased in cooling-flow clusters (70 per cent versus 10 per cent in non-cooling flow clusters), regardless of the mass density or velocity dispersion of\nthe cluster. This is also true here, where the corresponding\nfractions are 33 per cent in cooling-flow clusters and 21 per\ncent in non-cooling clusters, although the difference in the\nfractions is not as pronounced. One possible cause of this\ndifference could be that the fraction of BCGs with emission\nlines changes with the distance between the BCG and the\ncluster X-ray centre (Edwards et al. 2007; Best et al. 2007).\n\n6.4\n\nLog LX \u2013 log TX\n\nIt is believed that intrinsic scatter in the cluster X-ray\nluminosity\u2013temperature (LX \u2013TX ) relation is physical in origin, caused by processes such as radiative cooling, and those\nassociated with AGN (McCarthy et al. 2004; Bildfell et al.\n2008).\nFigure 14 shows the log LX \u2013 log TX plot for the host\nclusters for which the measurements of TX and LX were\navailable in the literature. We normalise LX with E(z) =\n1\n[\u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b ] 2 to correct for the evolution of the mean\nbackground density, where z is the redshift of the cluster.\nWe follow Bildfell et al. (2008) and fit a power law of the\nLX\n\u03b1\nform E(\nz) = \u03b2TX to the regular (i.e. old) BCGs (red dashed\nline in Figure 14). We find a strong correlation with t and\nP values of 6.66 and < 0.0001, respectively. Younger BCGs\ntend to be located above older BCGs in the diagram, i.e.\nthey are predominantly in clusters with X-ray excess. Five\nof the young galaxies for which the host cluster information\nis available are hosted by cooling-flow clusters (denoted by\na black circle). Only one of the younger galaxies, located\nat the bottom of the plot, NGC0541, is hosted by a cluster\nwithout cooling flows. The result that younger BCGs tend to\nbe hosted by clusters with X-ray excess agrees with the photometric result from Bildfell et al. (2008) who showed that\ntheir star forming BCGs are exclusively located in clusters\nwith a high-LX deviation from the LX \u2013TX relation \u2013 the region of the diagram usually populated by cool-core clusters.\nThis implies that the origin of the cold gas fuelling the star\nformation may be linked to the processes that give rise to\nthe LX excess, and points to cooling flows as the source of\nthe cold gas in galaxies with young stellar populations.\n\n6.5\n\nBCG offset from X-ray peak\n\nIf the star formation in all young BCGs is a result of cooling flows, then the young BCGs are expected to be located\nexclusively at the centres of relaxed clusters, where the cold\ngas is deposited. Furthermore, numerical simulations predict\nthat the offset of the BCG from the peak of the cluster X-ray\nemission is an indication of how close the cluster is to the\ndynamical equilibrium state, and decreases as the cluster\nevolves (Katayama et al. 2003).\n\n15\n\nFigure 14. Log (LX /E(z)) against log TX for the BCGs. The\nclusters hosting BCGs with ages log (age) < 0.8 Gyr are shown\nin blue, where the black circles denote young galaxies in coolingflow clusters. The majority of the LX values from the literature\ndoes not have errorbars.\n\nWe collected the projected angular separations between\nBCGs and the peak of the X-ray emission from the literature\nas shown in Table 7. For those clusters for which it was not\navailable, we calculated it from the BCG and published Xray peak coordinates. However, this was not possible for\nthose clusters, e.g. Coma, where a BCG is not in the centre\nand where the coordinates of a corresponding local X-ray\nmaximum were not available.\nFigure 15 shows the derived ages plotted against the Xray offsets, with separate symbols for galaxies in cooling and\nnon-cooling flow clusters, as well as plots of the derived SSPparameters against the offsets for all BCGs for which the\noffsets were available. Contrary to what was found by Bildfell et al. (2008), there is no significant difference in mean\nX-ray offsets for young and old galaxies. Thus, the younger\nBCGs are preferentially found in cooling-flow clusters, but\nthey are not necessarily closer to the centres of the clusters,\nwhere the cooling flows are deposited, than galaxies with old\nstellar populations.\nRafferty, McNamara & Nulsen (2008) found that the\ncentral galaxy is likely to experience significant star formation when: 1) the X-ray and galaxy centroids are within \u223c 20\nkpc of each other, and 2) the central cooling time of the hot\natmosphere is much less than \u223c 8 \u00d7 108 yr (an entropy of\nless than \u223c 30 keV cm2 ). Therefore, the younger BCGs need\nto be very close to the X-ray peaks, even though they are in\ncooling-flow clusters, for the recent star formation to be a\nresult of the cooling flows. As only three of the five younger\ngalaxies hosted by cooling-flow clusters are located within\n\u223c 20 kpc of the X-ray peak in the present sample, all the\nrecent star formation found in this sample is not necessarily\na consequence of the cooling flows.\nFigure 16 shows the X-ray offsets plotted against the\ngalaxy velocity dispersion and absolute K-band magnitude.\nBildfell et al. (2008) found a weak tendency for brightest\nBCGs to lie closest to their host cluster's X-ray peak while\nthe faintest BCGs are the furthest. This might be expected\nsince massive BCGs will locate at the centre of the cluster potential well on a shorter time-scale than less massive\nBCGs. They will also have an enhanced probability to merge\nwith small galaxies and will grow more rapidly than BCGs\n\n\f16\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure 15. Derived SSP-parameters plotted against BCG offset\nfrom the X-ray peak. The upper right plot shows the derived\nages plotted against the X-ray offsets, with separate symbols for\ngalaxies in cooling and non-cooling flow clusters. The other three\nplots show the derived SSP-parameters against the offsets for all\nBCGs for which the offsets were available.\n\nfurther away from the centre and they will be close to where\nthe cool gas is deposited (Bildfell et al. 2008). However, as\ncan be seen in Figure 16, no such trend can be seen for the\npresent sample, within the uncertainties.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have obtained high signal-to-noise ratio, long-slit spectra of 49 BCGs in the nearby Universe, and derived SSPequivalent ages, metallicities and \u03b1-enhancements in the\ncentres of 43 galaxies using the Lick/IDS system of absorption line indices. We compared the indices and parameters\nderived for these BCGs with those of ordinary ellipticals in\nthe same mass range. We tested the derived properties for\npossible correlations with the kinematic properties (velocity\ndispersion, rotation) and luminosity of the galaxies and the\nX-ray properties of the host clusters (density, mass, distance\nto X-ray peak, presence of cooling flows).\n\u2022 With the exception of G4300, we find no significant discrepancies between the index relations with velocity dispersion of the BCG data and those of normal ellipticals in the\nsame mass range. Only six (Ca4227, H\u03b3F , Ca4455, Fe4531,\nC2 4668 and Mgb ) out of 18 indices possess a statistically significant slope different from zero. The BCG data are much\nmore scattered around the derived index\u2013velocity dispersion\nslopes than the elliptical galaxies in that mass range.\n\u2022 In general, most BCGs are very old. However, 11 galaxies (26 per cent of the sample for which ages were derived)\nwere found with SSP-equivalent ages log (age) < 0.8 (in\nGyr). Young BCGs are not unusual. Other examples of observational signs of recent star formation and accretion activity in massive central galaxies in clusters are young glob-\n\nFigure 16. Galaxy velocity dispersion and absolute K-band magnitude plotted against X-ray offset.\n\nular clusters in NGC1275 and multiple nuclei in NGC6166\n(Trager et al. 2008, and references therein). Bildfell et al.\n(2008) also found 25 per cent of the 48 BCGs in their photometric sample to have blue cores. Active star formation\nin BCGs pose a challenge for simulations, which predict virtually no recent star formation due to the assumption of\nextremely efficient AGN feedback (for example De Lucia &\nBlaizot 2007).\n\u2022 No significant age\u2013velocity dispersion relation is found\nfor the BCG sample in this mass range. The peaks of the\nage distributions, and the slope of the age\u2013velocity dispersion relation of the BCG and elliptical samples are similar.\nHowever, the BCG age distribution also shows a smaller second peak at log (age) \u223c 0.65 which, although not statistically significant according to a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, is\nabsent in the elliptical galaxy distributions. Thus, it can be\nargued that the mean, generally old ages of BCGs are similar to normal giant elliptical galaxies, but there is a weak\nindication that for a small fraction of BCGs, recent star formation occurred as a result of their privileged location in\nthe centre of the cluster.\n\u2022 The peak of the metallicity distribution occurs at a\nhigher value for the BCGs than for the samples of massive\nelliptical galaxies. The BCG metallicity\u2013velocity dispersion\nrelation is similar in slope than that of normal ellipticals\n(Figures 7 and 9).\n\u2022 No significant [E/Fe]\u2013velocity dispersion relation is\nfound for the BCG sample in this mass range. The BCGs\nhave higher [E/Fe] values than the comparison elliptical\nsamples (Figures 7 and 9). This can naively be interpreted\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\nas a consequence of shorter formation time-scales in BCGs.\nHowever, other differences such as the IMF, differences in\nthe binary fractions, or selective winds that drive most of\nthe Fe-group elements to the intracluster medium cannot\nbe conclusively eliminated.\n\u2022 No real difference is visible in the ages of rotating and\nnon-rotating BCGs, and a wide range of ages were derived\nfor galaxies that show a lack of rotation. No relations between the derived parameters and absolute magnitude were\nfound for the BCG sample. The strong age\u2013metallicity relation found for BCGs is almost entirely due to the correlation\nbetween errors on the parameters.\n\u2022 No correlation is found between the X-ray luminosity of\nthe clusters and the velocity dispersion of the BCGs (Figure\n10). Thus, galaxies in higher density clusters are not necessarily more massive. BCGs with younger SSP-equivalent\nages are found in both dense and less dense host clusters,\nhowever, the relationships between the Balmer line indices\nand cluster X-ray luminosity possibly suggest two different\nregimes, and therefore an evolutionary history which is dependent on environment (Figure 11).\n\u2022 No clear correlation between host cluster velocity dispersion (cluster mass) and any of the derived parameters\n(age, metallicity and \u03b1-abundance) were found.\n\u2022 Several sources of gas for fuelling the recent star formation in BCGs have been postulated (discussed by Pipino\net al. 2009). These are: 1) cooling flows; 2) recycling of stellar ejecta; and 3) accretion of satellites. For the six young\ngalaxies (younger than \u223c 6 Gyr) for which cooling flow information is available, only one is hosted by a cluster without\na cooling flow. This suggest that the recent star formation\nin this galaxy (NGC0541) might have been fuelled by gas\ndeposited in a merger event, or perhaps triggered by the\nradio jet originating from the galaxy's supermassive black\nhole. NGC0541 is known to be very peculiar and is associated with Minkowski's Object, an irregular dwarf located\n16 kpc from NGC0541 and in the path of the galaxy's radio\njet. The radio jet is thought to have triggered the starburst\nin Minkowski's Object (Schaerer, Contini & Pindao 1999;\nVerdoes Kleijn et al. 1999; Croft et al. 2006).\n\u2022 As mentioned above, there is a tendency that the\nyounger galaxies in this BCG sample are hosted by clusters\nwith cooling flows. In addition, the LX \u2013TX cluster relation\nshows that the younger BCGs are located in clusters with\nlarge values of X-ray excess. However, some of the younger\ngalaxies were found to be slightly further away from the Xray peak of the cluster. This will limit the influence of the\ncluster cooling flows, which in turn suggests that the possibility that the gas fuelling the star formation had its origin\nin mergers cannot be discarded. On the other hand, potential merging and capturing of less massive galaxies would be\nenhanced by the galaxy being close to the cluster potential\nwell.\nIn summary: There are differences \u2013 albeit small \u2013 between the stellar populations in BCGs and ordinary elliptical galaxies over the same mass range. The BCGs show\nhigher metallicity and \u03b1-enhancement values. The former\npossibly indicates more efficient star formation, and the latter is most commonly interpreted as a consequence of shorter\nformation time-scales in BCGs. The SSP-equivalent parameters show very little dependence on the mass or brightness\n\n17\n\nof the galaxies, or the mass or density of the host clusters.\nNo real differences are found between the ages of rotating\nand non-rotating BCGs. Most of BCGs are very old, as expected. However, 11 galaxies (26 per cent of the sample for\nwhich ages were derived) were found to have intermediate\nages (SSP-equivalent ages of < 6 Gyr). We have shown that\nthe younger BCGs tend to be found in cooling flow clusters which lies above the LX \u2013TX relation. However, this is\nnot exclusively the case. In at least one of the young BCGs\n(NGC0541 \u2013 hosted by a cluster without cooling flows), the\ngas must have a different origin. This means that there is\nlikely to be more than one process responsible for the recent star formation in BCGs. In addition, the younger BCGs\nseem to be slightly further away from the cluster X-ray peak,\nlimiting the influence of the cooling flows. As a result, the\npossibility that more of the young BCGs experienced recent\nmergers or accretion events involving gas, and leading to\nstar formation, should not be discounted. Overall, the recent star formation in BCGs, and the connection with the\nprocesses in the cluster centres, is very complex.\nAll the indices and SSP results discussed here are only\nfor the central regions of the galaxies. The radial SSP gradients in BCGs will be investigated in a subsequent paper.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSIL thanks the South African National Research Foundation and the University of Central Lancashire for a StobieSALT Scholarship, and gratefully acknowledges helpful discussions with Rob Proctor and Scott Trager.

The Lick stars used for the\nGemini data are from the Gemini Science Archive and were\nobserved with an observational set-up corresponding to that\nof the galaxy data presented here (PI: Bryan Miller, private\ncommunication).\nAs the first step, the Lick star spectra observed with\nboth sets of observations in this work (the WHT and the\nGemini data) were shifted to zero radial velocity (Doppler\ncorrection), and broadened to the wavelength-dependent\nresolution of the original Lick/IDS spectra (Worthey & Ottaviani 1997).\nThe instrumental broadening (\u03c3I ) of the WHT telescope\nand ISIS CCD as well as that of the Gemini telescopes and\nGMOS-N and GMOS-S were measured from the emission\nlines of the arc spectra. The lines were fitted by Gaussian\nfunctions from which the FWHMs were measured.\nThe stellar velocity dispersion weakens the strength of\nmost absorption features. To calculate the effects of velocity\ndispersion on the index measurements, the Lick star spectra\nwere smoothed to varying widths in the range \u03c3c = 0 to 300\nkm s\u22121 , in intervals of 20 km s\u22121 , where \u03c3c is the width\nof the broadening Gaussian. Following Proctor & Sansom\n(2002), correction factors Ci (\u03c3c ) were determined.\nFor molecular line indices (CN1 , CN2 , Mg1 , Mg2 , TiO1\nand TiO2 ) and for indices with ranges which include negative values (i.e. H\u03b3 and H\u03b4):\nCi (\u03c3c ) = IL \u2212 IMeasured ,\n\nIndex measurements depend on the broadening of the absorption lines caused by both the instrumental spectral resolution and the line-of-sight velocities of the stars. In order to use model predictions based on the Lick system, the\nobserved spectra need to be degraded to the wavelengthdependent resolution of the Lick/IDS spectrograph, and the\nindices need to be corrected for the broadening caused by\nthe velocity dispersion of the galaxies.\nThis section entails the calibration to the Lick/IDS system which consists of three effects that should be accounted\nfor to compare the observed values with those predicted by\nmodels:\n\u2022 The difference in spectral resolution between the observational data, and that of the Lick stars observed with the\nLick set-up (Faber et al. 1985).\n\u2022 The internal velocity dispersion of the galaxies.\n\u2022 Small systematic differences caused by the fact that the\nLick/IDS spectra were not flux-calibrated.\n\nA1\n\nCorrection to Lick spectral resolution and\nvelocity dispersion corrections\n\nA total of 22 Lick calibration stars were observed with the\n5300 \u00c5 dichroic and 10 with the 6100 \u00c5 dichroic at the\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere IL is the index value at the calibration resolution and\nIMeasured the index value measured in the broadened star\nspectrum.\nFor all the other atomic line indices:\nCi (\u03c3c ) = IL /IMeasured .\n\nAPPENDIX A: CONVERTING TO THE\nLICK/IDS SYSTEM\n\n19\n\n(A2)\n\nFor each of the indices, Ci was plotted against \u03c3c , and\na third order polynomial (Ci = x0 +x1 \u03c3c +x2 \u03c3c2 +x3 \u03c3c3 ) was\nfitted. The value of x0 was fixed at zero for the molecular,\nH\u03b3 and H\u03b4 indices and at one for the other atomic indices.\nFigure A1 shows the broadening functions of the Gemini data as an example, and the plots illustrate how the index measurements are affected by velocity dispersion broadening. The derived WHT broadening functions agreed very\nwell when compared with those published by Proctor & Sansom (2002) and Kuntschner (2004).\np Depending on whether galaxies have a total broadening\n2\n) greater or smaller than \u03c3L , where \u03c3I is the in( \u03c3I2 + \u03c3V\nstrumental broadening, \u03c3V is the galaxy velocity dispersion\nand \u03c3L is the Lick resolution, their spectra were effectively\ndebroadened or broadened to the Lick resolution, as well as\ncorrected for the broadening caused by the velocity dispersion of the galaxies.\n\nA2\n\nCorrections to the Lick flux scale\n\nThe original Lick/IDS spectra were not flux-calibrated by\nmeans of spectrophotometric standard stars but instead\nwere normalised to a calibration lamp. This causes small\ndifferences in the indices compared with those measured\nfrom flux-calibrated data. By comparing the measured indices in the observed, flux-calibrated stars with those in the\nLick/IDS database, the mean differences in index measure-\n\n\f20\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure A1.

Values for the calibration of the Gemini data to Lick resolution and offsets. The values of the Lick spectral resolution (\u03c3L )\nwere taken from Worthey & Ottaviani (1997) and are given as FWHM values, where FWHM = 2.35\u03c3L (in \u00c5). The values of \u2206I are\nLick \u2013 this work, and the RMS are the error on the mean. \u2217 Relations were derived for the two CN offsets (as described in Section A2),\nwhereas all the other offsets were found to be independent of the strength of the index.\n\nments caused by this flux scale difference can be derived for\nall the indices.\nIndex values were measured from the Lick star spectra\nobserved in this work (WHT and Gemini data) broadened\nup to the Lick/IDS resolution. Comparisons to the Lick star\ndata presented in Worthey (1994) and Worthey and Ottaviani (1997) for the same stars enabled the calculation of the\nmean Lick index differences (hereafter called offsets, \u2206I). For\nall the Lick index measurements presented here, the flux calibration correction was performed by adding the appropriate\n\u2206I to the measured index value.\nAll the offsets derived for the WHT and Gemini data\nwere independent of the strength of the index itself, with\nthe exception of the two Gemini CN indices. For all other\nindices the average differences were computed and used as\nfinal corrections. For the CN indices, correlations between\nthe offsets and the measured index values (from this work)\nwere found:\n\u2206I = \u22120.0109 + 0.201 \u00d7 CN1\n\n(A3)\n\n\u2206I = \u22120.0150 + 0.184 \u00d7 CN2\n\n(A4)\n\nFor all indices, the error \u221a\nin calibration to the Lick system\nwas calculated as RMS/ N \u2212 1, where N is the number\nof calibration stars (N = 17 for the Gemini data, N =\n20 for the WHT data 5300 dichroic and N = 10 for the\nWHT data 6100 dichroic). The Gemini offsets are shown\nin Figure A2 as an example. As can be seen in the plots,\nthe offsets are typically smaller than the error on the index\nmeasurement. A comparison was made between the Gemini\n\noffsets derived in this work with those derived by M. Norris\n(private communication), using the same archive data of the\nLick stars. No systematic differences between the two sets\nof offsets were visible. Most of the offsets used here are in\nagreement, with the exception of C2 4668 and Ca4455 which\nare slightly higher than those derived by M. Norris.\nTable A1 shows all the parameters of the calibration\nto the Lick system for the Gemini data as an example, and\nsimilar parameters were derived for the WHT data.\n\nAPPENDIX B: INDICES: COMPARISON WITH\nPREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS\nThe central index measurements were compared to those\nof Trager (1998, hereafter T98) for 14 galaxies which the\nsamples had in common. The measurements of the original\n21 Lick indices were presented in T98, and the four higherorder Balmer indices (of the same galaxy sample) in Lee\n& Worthey 2005 (hereafter LW05). The central values of\nthe T98 sample were measured in an aperture of 1.4 \u00d7 4\narcsec2 . Only one of the 14 galaxies had TiO2 measurements\nin both T98 and this sample, so no comparison of TiO2\nmeasurements were made. Galaxies with large differences in\ncertain indices (for example a few Fe5270 measurements)\nwere compared on an individual basis (S. Trager, private\ncommunication), and can be attributed to lower S/N data.\nThe central index measurements were also compared to\nthose of SB06 for five galaxies in common (also indicated in\nFigure B1). For this comparison, the same central aperture\n\n\f22\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure A2. Gemini offsets derived from index measurements (original Lick data \u2013 this work) plotted against the original Lick measurements. The dashed horizontal line represents the Lick offset.\n\n\fStellar populations in BCGs\nof the galaxies was extracted, and 15 indices measured from\nthe SB06 data. Nine index measurements for five galaxies\nwere also compared with those measured by Ogando et al.\n(2008, hereafter OG08). The indices from OG08 were measured within a metric circular aperture equivalent to 1.19\nkpc at the distance of the Coma cluster. No flux calibration\nwas applied to these galaxies. No comparison between the\nsix different observing runs (WHT, Gemini North 06B and\n07A, Gemini South 06B, 07A and 07B) and T98, SB06 or\nOG08 could be made since there were too few galaxies in\ncommon. In total, index measurements of 15 galaxies (some\nof the galaxies being in common with more than one of the\nabove-mentioned samples) could be compared, and are all\nshown in Figure B1. This comparison shows that the H\u03b4A\nindex measurements in the Gemini data are systematically\nhigher (by 1 \u2013 2 \u00c5) compared with previous measurements,\nand shows a large amount of scatter. No other systematic\ndifferences were found. With the exception of the TiO1 index, which was often very close to the edge of the spectrum\nin the BCG data, all the index comparison plots show scatter that is smaller than that expected from the errors on the\nindex measurements.\n\nAPPENDIX C: NOTES ON INDIVIDUAL\nOBJECTS\nThis section contains notes of some of the individual objects that could be compared with existing SSP-equivalent\nmeasurements from the literature.\n\nIC1633\nThe surface brightness profile of this galaxy was published\nby Schombert (1986), and HST imaging by Laine et al.\n(2003). The radial velocity profile reveals some evidence for\nsubstructure at the centre of this galaxy (Paper 1). The SSP\nequivalent parameters derived for the central 81 Re in this\nstudy (log (age) = 0.935 \u00b1 0.187; [E/Fe] = 0.440 \u00b1 0.039;\n[Z/H] = 0.380 \u00b1 0.061) could be compared with those pre1\nsented in T05 for the central 10\nRe (log (age) = 0.716 \u00b1\n0.308; [E/Fe] = 0.366 \u00b1 0.024; [Z/H] = 0.563 \u00b1 0.057).\n\nNGC1399\nThe surface brightness profile was published by Schombert\n(1986). Paper 1 showed a steep decreasing velocity dispersion profile and a flat radial velocity profile with a small\ndip in the centre. Lyubenova, Kuntschner & Silva (2008)\nwere able to investigate the centres of the kinematic profiles\nof NGC1399 in much more detail, and interpreted this dip\n(r 6 0.2 arcsec) from high resolution K-band maps of the\ncentral kinematics as a dynamically cold subsystem in the\ncentre. This cold subsystem could be a central stellar disc\nor globular cluster having fallen into the centre on a purely\nradial orbit (Lyubenova et al. 2008). An age of 8.6 \u00b1 0.9 Gyr\nwas found for this galaxy in this study, which is consistent\nwith the age of 10 \u00b1 2 Gyr found by Forbes et al. (2001).\n\n23\n\nNGC2832\nThe surface brightness profiles were published by Schombert\n(1986) and Jord\u00e1n et al. (2004), and HST imaging by Laine\net al. (2003). The radial velocity profile shows the presence\nof a KDC in the centre of this galaxy (Paper 1). The SSP\nequivalent parameters derived for the central 81 Re in this\nstudy ( log (age) = 0.929 \u00b1 0.024; [E/Fe] = 0.380 \u00b1 0.043;\n[Z/H] = 0.480 \u00b1 0.062) are in very good agreement with\nthat derived by other authors. Proctor & Sansom (2002)\nderived log (age) = 0.875 \u00b1 0.069; [E/Fe] = 0.300 \u00b1 0.025;\n[Z/H] = 0.457 \u00b1 0.074 for the central 3.6 \u00d7 1.25 arcsec2 .\nS\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. (2006b) derived log (age) = 0.995\n\u00b1 0.007 in the centre (equivalent aperture of 4\" at a redshift\nof z = 0.016).\n\nNGC4839\nSurface brightness profiles were published by Schombert\n(1986), Oemler (1976) as well as Jord\u00e1n et al. (2004), who\nall confirm the presence of a very prominent cD envelope.\nRotation of the order 44 km s\u22121 and a KDC in the centre\nof the galaxy are detected (Paper 1). Table C1 shows the\nSSP-equivalent ages and metallicities for the three BCGs\nin the Coma cluster from the literature (as summarised by\nTrager et al. 2008). The data from this study is for 18 Re . For\nMehlert et al. (2000), S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. (2006b) and\nTrager et al. (2008) the data is for 2.7 arcsec diameter equivalent circular apertures (by Trager et al. 2008), and for the\nother references as originally published. It can be seen that\nthe literature SSP-equivalent age falls in a very large range,\nand the value derived in this study is within this range.\n\nNGC4874\nThis galaxy has a large, extended envelope, and is the second\nbrightest galaxy of the famous pair of BCGs at the centre\nof the Coma cluster. The surface brightness profile was published by Peletier et al. (1990). No significant rotation or\nvelocity substructure is detected for this galaxy (Paper 1).\nTrager et al. (2008) compiled a list of all the central H\u03b2\nmeasurements for this galaxy, and found an error weighted\nmean value of 1.57 \u00b1 0.05 \u00c5 (including data from Fisher\net al. 1995; Trager et al. 1998; J\u00f8rgensen 1999; Kuntschner\net al. 2001; Moore et al. 2002; Nelan et al. 2005; S\u00e1nchezBl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006b). The H\u03b2 index measured here (1.630\n\u00b1 0.082 \u00c5) compares very well with the literature data. Table C1 shows the SSP-equivalent parameters compared with\nthose from the literature.\n\nNGC4889\nA large BCG with a very extended envelope, and the brightest galaxy of the Coma cluster. The surface brightness profile\nwas published by Peletier et al. (1990), and HST imaging by\nLaine et al. (2003). The radial velocity profile clearly shows\na KDC (Paper 1). Table C1 shows the SSP-equivalent parameters compared to that of the literature. Similarly to the\nother Coma BCGs, the ages fall in a very large range, and\nthe value derived in this study is within this range.\n\n\f24\n\nLoubser et al.\n\nFigure B1.
