Introduction\nAn operator T is said to be homogeneous if its spectrum is contained in the closed unit disc and for\nevery M\u00f6bius transformation g of the unit disc D, the operator g(T ) defined via the usual holomorphic\nfunctional calculus, is unitarily equivalent to T . To every homogeneous irreducible operator T there\ncorresponds (cf. [1, Theorem 2.2]) an associated projective unitary representation U of the M\u00f6bius\ngroup G0 :\nUg\u2217 T Ug = g(T ), g \u2208 G0 .\nThe projective unitary representations of G0 lift to unitary representations of the universal cover\nf0 which are quite well-known. We can choose (cf. [1, Lemma 3.1]) Ug such that k 7\u2192 Uk is a\nG\nrepresentation of the rotation group. If\nH(n) = {x \u2208 H : Uk\u03b8 x = ei n\u03b8 x},\n\nwhere k\u03b8 (z) = ei\u03b8 z, then T : H(n) \u2192 H(n + 1) is a block shift. A complete classification of\nthese for dim H(n) \u2264 1 was obtained in [1] using the representation theory of G\u03030 . First examples\nfor dim H(n) = 2 appeared in [14]. Recently [7, 9], an m - parameter family of examples with\ndim H(n) = m was constructed. We will use the ideas of [7, 9] to obtain a complete classification of\nthe homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class. Finally, we describe the similarity classes\nwithin the homogeneous Cowen-Douglas operators. As a consequence, we obtain an affirmative\nanswer to the Halmos question (cf. [10]) for this class of operators. We also include a somewhat\nnew conceptual presentation of the Cowen-Douglas theory and a brief description of the method of\nholomorphic induction, which will be our main tool. Our paper is essentially self contained and can\nbe read without the knowledge of [7] and [9]. The results of this paper were announced in [8] except\nfor Theorem 4.2.\n1.1. Vector bundles. Let M be a complex manifold and suppose \u03c0 : E \u2192 M is a complex vector\nbundle. We write, as usual, Ez = \u03c0 \u22121 (z). For a trivialization, \u03c6 : E \u2192 M \u00d7 Cn , we write\n\u03c6(v) = (z, \u03c6z (v)) for v \u2208 Ez with \u03c6z : Ez \u2192 Cn linear. (All we are going to say here would be valid\nusing local trivializations, but in this article we will always work with global trivializations.)\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We consider Cn to be equipped with its natural inner product and identify it with\nits own anti-linear dual (so \u03be \u2208 Cn is identified with the anti-linear map \u03b7 7\u2192 h\u03be, \u03b7iCn ). Then\n\u03c6\u2217z : Cn \u2192 Ez\u2217 is well-defined. We set \u03c8z = \u03c6\u2217z \u22121 and \u03c8(u) = (z, \u03c8z (u)) for u \u2208 Ez\u2217 . This makes\nE \u2217 a complex vector bundle with trivialization \u03c8. We call \u03c6 and \u03c8, the associated trivializations\nof E and E \u2217 . If E is a holomorphic vector bundle then E \u2217 is an anti-holomorphic vector bundle\n(meaning that for any two trivializations, \u03c8\u03b1 and \u03c8\u03b2 , the transition functions z 7\u2192 (\u03c8\u03b1 )z \u25e6 (\u03c8\u03b2 )z \u22121\nare anti-holomorphic) and vice-versa.\nIf E has a Hermitian structure, we automatically equip E \u2217 with the dual structure (giving the\ndual norm of Ez to Ez\u2217 for all z \u2208 M ).\nBy an automorphism of \u03c0 : E \u2192 M , we mean a diffeomorphism \u011d : E \u2192 E such that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u011d = g \u25e6 \u03c0\nfor some automorphism g of M . We write gz for the restriction of \u011d to Ez . The automorphism \u011d also\nacts on the sections f of E, by (\u011d\u2217 f )(z) = gz\u22121 f (gz). When G is the group of automorphisms of E\n(acting on the left, as usual) we have a representation U of G on the sections given by U\u011d f = (\u011d\u22121 )\u2217 f ,\nthat is,\n(U\u011d f )(z) = gz f (g\u22121 z).\nEz\u2217 ,\n\nGiven an automorphism g of E, there is a corresponding automorphism of E \u2217 , where the place of\ngz is taken by gz\u2217 \u22121 . This also remains true in the category of Hermitian bundles. It follows that a\ngroup G of automorphisms of E also acts as a group of automorphisms of E \u2217 . If E is homogeneous,\nthat is, the action of G is transitive on M , then so is E \u2217 , and vice-versa.\n1.2. Reproducing kernel. We describe, essentially following [2], how the usual formalism of reproducing kernels can be adapted to vector bundles. Suppose H is a Hilbert space whose elements are\nsections of a vector bundle E \u2192 M and suppose the maps evz : H \u2192 Ez are continuous for all\nz \u2208 M . Then setting Kz = ev\u2217z , we have\n[u, f (z)] = [u, evz (f )] = hKz u, f iH , u \u2208 Ez , f \u2208 H.\n\n(1.1)\n\u0001\nFor all w \u2208 M then Kw u is in H and is linear in u. So, we can write Kw (z)u = evz Kw u =\n\u2217 \u2192 E , and is called\nevz ev\u2217w (u). We also write K(z, w) = Kw (z) = evz ev\u2217w which is a linear map Ew\nz\nthe reproducing kernel of H, (1.1) is the reproducing property.\nP\nClearly, K(w, z) = K(z, w)\u2217 . We have the positivity j,k [uk , K(zk , zj )uj ] \u2265 0 for any z1 , . . . , zp\nin M and u1 , . . . , up \u2208 Ez\u2217 which is nothing but the inequality\nX\nh(evzk )\u2217 uk , (ev zj )\u2217 uj iH \u2265 0.\nj,k\n\nConversely, a K with these properties is always the reproducing kernel of a Hilbert space of sections\nof E (cf. [2]).\nSuppose we have a vector bundle E and a Hilbert space H of sections of E with reproducing kernel\nK; suppose \u011d is an automorphism of E. Then \u011d acts on the sections of E by (g\u2217 f )(z) = gz\u22121 f (gz).\nBy the density of linear combinations of the sections of the form Kw u, the condition for this action\nto preserve H and act on it isometrically is\nhg\u2217 (Kw u), Kz u\u2032 iH = hKw u, (g\u22121 )\u2217 (Kz u\u2032 )iH\n\nfor all z, w; u, u\u2032 . Evaluating both sides using (1.1), this amounts to\n\u2217\nK(gz, gw) = gz K(z, w) gw\n, for all z, w \u2208 M.\n\nThe following remarks will be important for us. Suppose each evz is non-singular, that is, its range\nis the whole of Ez . (This is so in the important case where H is dense in the space of sections of\nE in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets.) Then Kz = ev\u2217z is an imbedding of Ez\u2217\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n3\n\ninto H. Postulating that this imbedding is an isometry we obtain a canonical Hermitian structure\non E \u2217 . Using (1.1) we can write for the norm on E \u2217\nkuk2z = kKz uk2H = [u, K(z, z)u], u \u2208 Ez\u2217 .\nThe vector bundle E has the dual Hermitian structure, for v \u2208 Ez we have\nkvk2z = [K(z, z)\u22121 v, v].\nIn fact this statement amounts to\n|[u, v]|2 \u2264 [K(z, z)\u22121 v, v][u, K(z, z)u]\nfor all u, v with equality reached for some u, v. Since K(z, w) is bijective by hypothesis, any v \u2208 Ez\ncan be written as v = K(z, z)u\u2032 with u\u2032 \u2208 Ez\u2217 and the inequality to be proved is equivalent to\n|[u, K(z, z)u\u2032 ]|2 \u2264 [u\u2032 , K(z, z)u\u2032 ][u, K(z, z)u]. But this is just the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\nWhen E is a holomorphic vector bundle, K(z, w) depends in z holomorphically and on w antiholomorphically. Hence K(z, w) is completely determined by K(z, z). It follows that K(z, w) is\ncompletely determined by the canonical Hermitian structure of E (or E \u2217 ).\nIn the last paragraphs, we had a Hilbert space H of sections of E and (under the assumption that\neach evz is surjective) we associated to it a family of imbeddings of Ez\u2217 , the fibres of E \u2217 , into H.\nThis procedure can be reversed which is of importance for what follows. Suppose now that E is a\nvector bundle and the fibres Ez\u2217 of E \u2217 form a smooth family of subspaces of some Hilbert space H\nwhich together span H, that is, E \u2217 is a anti-holomorphic sub-bundle of the trivial bundle M \u00d7 H).\nWe write \u03b9z : Ez\u2217 \u2192 H for the (identity) imbeddings. We define, f \u0303(z) = \u03b9\u2217z f for f \u2208 H, z \u2208 M . Then\nf \u0303 is a section of E and evz (f \u0303) = \u03b9\u2217z f . If we denote by H the Hilbert space of all f \u0303, f \u2208 H, with norm\nkf \u0303k = kf k, each evz is continuous, so we have a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The reproducing\nkernel is Kz u = \u03b9f\nz u.\n\n1.3. Operators in the Cowen-Douglas class. We modify the definition of the class of operators introduced in [4] in an inessential way. A conceptual presentation in which the role of the dual of the\nbundle constructed in [4] is apparent follows. Given a domain \u03a9 \u2286 C, we say the bounded operator\nT on the Hilbert space H is in Bn (\u03a9) if z\u0304 is an eigenvalue of T , the range of the operator T \u2212 z\u0304\nis closed, and the corresponding eigenspaces Fz are of constant dimension n for z \u2208 \u03a9. It is proved\nin [4] that the spaces Fz span an anti-holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle F \u2286 \u03a9 \u00d7 H. (In [4] the\neigenvalues are z \u2208 \u03a9 and so F is a holomorphic vector bundle; it is more convenient for us to change\nthis.) We write, for z \u2208 \u03a9, \u03b9z : Fz \u2192 H for the identity imbedding. Now, E = F \u2217 is a holomorphic\nvector bundle, this will be the primary object for us. The bundle F is identified with E \u2217 , in what\nfollows we refer to it as E \u2217 . We are now in the situation discussed above in Section 1.2.\nTo the elements f of H there correspond the sections f \u0303 of E (defined by f \u0303(z) = \u03b9\u2217z f ) and form a\nHilbert space H isomorphic with H and having a reproducing kernel Kz u = \u03b9f\nz u.\nUnder this isomorphism, the operator on H corresponding to T is M \u2217 , where M is the multiplication operator (M f \u0303)(z) = z f \u0303(z). In fact (cf. [4]) for any u \u2208 Ez\u2217 ,\n\u2217 f (z)] = h\u03b9 u, T \u2217 f i\n[u, Tg\nz\nH\n\n= hT \u03b9z u, f iH = z\u0304h\u03b9z u, f iH\n= [u, z f \u0303(z)] = [u, M f \u0303(z)]\n\n1.4. Trivialization. Finally, we describe how the preceding material appears when the vector bundle is\ntrivialized. We always use associated trivializations \u03c6, \u03c8 of E and E \u2217 . As explained in the beginning,\nthis means that \u03c8z = \u03c6\u2217z \u22121 , that is, [u, v] = h\u03c8z u, \u03c6z viCn for u \u2208 Ez\u2217 and v \u2208 Ez . We will consider\nhere only the case where E is a holomorphic vector bundle.

Induced representations. We briefly recall some known facts of representation theory. Let G, H\nbe real (or, complex) Lie groups and H \u2286 G be closed. Given a representation \u033a of H on a complex\nfinite dimensional vector space V , let F(G, V )H denote the linear space of C \u221e (or holomorphic)\nfunctions F : G \u2192 V satisfying\nF (gh) = \u033a(h)\u22121 F (g), g \u2208 G, h \u2208 H.\n\nH\nThe induced representation (cf. [5, p. 187]) U := IndG\nH (\u033a) acts on the linear space F(G, V ) by left\n\u22121\ntranslation: (Ug1 f )(g2 ) = f (g1 g2 ).\nFrom the linear representations (\u033a, V ) of H, one obtains all the G - homogeneous vector bundles\nover M = G/H as G \u00d7H V , which is (G \u00d7 V )/ \u223c, where\n\n(gh, v) \u223c (g, \u033a(h)v), h, g \u2208 G, v \u2208 V.\n\nThe map (g, v) 7\u2192 gH is clearly constant on the equivalence class [(g, v)] and hence defines a map\n\u03c0 : G \u00d7H\u0001 V \u2192 M . An action \u011d, g \u2208 G, of the group G is now defined on G \u00d7H V by setting\ngb\u2032 [(g, v)] = [(g\u2032 g, v)]. This definition is independent of the choice of the representatives chosen.\nThus G \u00d7H V is a homogeneous vector bundle on M . As in Section\u0001 1.1, there is a representation\nU of G on the sections of G \u00d7H V , where (U (g)s)(x) = \u011d s(g\u22121 * x) . The lift to G of the section\ns of the vector bundle G \u00d7H V is s\u0303 : G \u2192 V with s\u0303(g) := \u011d\u22121 s(gH). These again form the space\nF(G, V )H which shows that U is just another realization of the representation U.\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n5\n\nWhen M is a manifold with a group G acting on it transitively, we use the usual identification\nM = G/H, where H is the stabilizer in G of a chosen fixed point 0 \u2208 M . The map q : g 7\u2192 g * 0 is\nthe quotient map from G to M . Suppose that there exists a global cross-section p : M \u2192 G, that is,\na map with q \u25e6 p = id| M . Then p gives a trivialization of the bundle E = G \u00d7H V . The trivializing\nmap \u03c6 is given for v \u2208 Ez by \u03c6(v) = (z, p(z)\u22121 v), that is, \u03c6z = p(z)\u22121 . (This \u03c6 actually maps\nto M \u00d7 E0 , but E0 with H acting on it by the bundle action can be identified with (\u033a, V ).) As in\nSection 1.4, the action of G on Ez becomes Jg (z)\u22121 = \u03c6gz \u25e6 gz \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nz which is now the group product\np(gz)\u22121 gp(z) (preserving the fibre E0 ) followed by the identification of E0 with V = Cn , that is,\n\u0001\nJg (z) = \u033a p(z)\u22121 g\u22121 p(g(z)) , z \u2208 M, g \u2208 G.\n(1.4)\n\nThe representation U appears now as the multiplier representation with multiplier (1.4).\nEven though not needed in this paper, we\n\u0001 point out that given any J : G\u00d7M \u2192 GLn (C) satisfying\nthe cocycle condition (1.2), the map Ug f (z) = Jg\u22121 (z)f (g\u22121 * z) defines a multiplier representation\nof the group G. Also, it defines a representation \u033a : h 7\u2192 Jh\u22121 (0) of the group H on the vector space\nV . The representation induced by this \u033a is equivalent to U . In fact, the multiplier corresponding to\nthe cross section p and the representation \u033a is\n\u0001\n\u033a p(z)\u22121 g \u22121 p(g * z) = Jp(g*z)\u22121 gp(z) (0)\n= Jp(z) (0)Jp(g*z)\u22121 g (p(z) * 0)\n\n= Jp(z) (0)Jg (z)Jp(g*z)\u22121 (g * z)\n\n= Jp(z) (0)Jg (z)Jp(g*0) (0)\u22121 .\n\nwhich is equivalent to the multiplier J.\nWe remark that the inducing construction always gives a multiplier such that Jg (z) \u2208 \u033a(H) for\nall g, z. Not all multipliers possess this additional property. However, given any multiplier J, we\ncan always find another multiplier J \u2032 equivalent to J such that Jg\u2032 (z) \u2208 \u033a(H), where \u033a(h) = Jh\u22121 (0).\nThis is achieved by taking any section p and setting\nJg\u2032 (z) = Jp(z) (0)Jg (z)Jp(g*z) (0)\u22121 .\nHolomorphic induced representation is a refinement of the induced representation in the case of\nreal groups G, H such that G/H has a G - invariant complex structure. The complex structure\ndetermines a subalgebra b of gC , namely the isotropy algebra in the local action of gC on G/H. The\nholomorphic induced representation is the restriction of the induced representation to a subspace\nof F(G, V )H , defined by the differential equations XF = \u2212\u033a(X)F for all X \u2208 b, where \u033a now is a\nrepresentation of the pair (H, b). It is an important fact that every G - homogeneous holomorphic\nvector bundle arises by holomorphic induction from a simultaneous finite dimensional representation\n\u033a of H and b (cf. [5, Ch. 13]). We will use this fact to determine all the holomorphic vector bundles\nwhich are homogeneous under the universal cover of the M\u00f6bius group.\n2. Homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles\nIn the following, we explicitly construct all the irreducible homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian\nvector bundles over the unit disc D. Every homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle\non D is then obtained as a direct sum of the irreducible ones (Corollary 2.1). In Section 4, we\ndetermine which ones of these irreducible homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles over\nD correspond to operators in the Cowen-Douglas class Bn (D).\n2.1. The M\u00f6bius group. Let G0 be the M\u00f6bius group \u2013 the group of bi-holomorphic automorphisms\nof the unit disc D, G = SU(1, 1) and K \u2286 G be the rotation group. Let G\u0303 be the universal covering\ngroup of G (and also that of the group G0 ). The group G acts on the unit disc D according to the\n\n\f6\n\nADAM KOR\u00c1NYI AND GADADHAR MISRA\n\nrule\ng : z 7\u2192 (az + b)(b\u0304z + \u0101)\u22121 , g =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\na b\n\u2208 G, z \u2208 D.\nb\u0304 \u0101\n\nThe group G\u0303 also acts on D (by g * z = q(g) * z, where q : G\u0303 \u2192 G is the covering map), we denote\nthe stabilizer of 0 in it by K\u0303. So D \u223c\n= G/K \u223c\n= G\u0303/K\u0303. The complexification GC of the group G is the\n(simply connected) group SL(2, C).\nIn the following, we use the notation of [7, 9], which is the notation used in [13].

The subalgebra k\n1 0\n0 \u2212i\n1 0\ncorresponding to K is spanned by X0 . In the complexified Lie algebra gC , we mostly use the complex\nbasis h, x, y given by\n1 \u00101 0 \u0011\nh = \u2212iX0 =\n2 0 \u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 1\nx = X1 + iY =\n0 0\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 0\ny = X1 \u2212 iY =\n1 0\n\nThe subgroup of GC corresponding to g is G.

The product KC P \u2212 =\n: 0 6= a \u2208 C, b \u2208 C is a closed\nb a1\nsubgroup to be also denoted B; its Lie algebra is b = Ch + Cy. The product set P + KC P \u2212 = P + B\nis dense open in GC , contains G, and the product decomposition of each of its elements is unique.\n(GC /B is the Riemann sphere, gK \u2192 gB, (g \u2208 G) is the natural embedding of D \u223c\n= G/K into it.)\nLinear representations (\u033a, V ) of the algebra b \u2286 gC = sl(2, C), that is, pairs of linear transformations\n\u033a(h), \u033a(y) satisfying\n[\u033a(h), \u033a(y)] = \u2212\u033a(y)\n(2.1)\nare automatically representations of K as well. Therefore they give, by holomorphic induction, all\nthe homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles.\nA homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle that admits a G\u0303 - invariant Hermitian structure will be\ncalled Hermitizable. Since the vector bundles corresponding to operators in the Cowen - Douglas class\nare of this type, we only consider these bundles (except for some comments following Remark 3.1).\nThe G\u0303 - invariant Hermitian structures on the homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle (making it\ninto a homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle), if they exist, are given by \u033a(K\u0303) - invariant\ninner products on the representation space V . A \u033a(K\u0303) - invariant inner product exists if and only\nif \u033a(h) is diagonal with real diagonal elements in an appropriate basis. So, we will assume without\nrestricting generality, that the representation space of \u033a is Cd and that \u033a(h) is a real diagonal matrix.\nFurthermore, we will be interested only in irreducible homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector\nbundles, this corresponds to \u033a not being the orthogonal direct sum of non-trivial representations.\nLet V\u03bb be the eigenspace of \u033a(h) with eigenvalue \u03bb. We say that a Hermitizable homogeneous\nholomorphic vector bundle is elementary if the eigenvalues of \u033a(h) form an uninterrupted string:\n\u2212\u03b7, \u2212(\u03b7 + 1), . . . , \u2212(\u03b7 + m). Every irreducible homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle\nis elementary, In fact, let \u2212\u03b7 be the largest eigenvalue of \u033a(h) and m be the largest integer such\nthat \u2212\u03b7, \u2212(\u03b7 + 1), . . . , \u2212(\u03b7 + m) are all eigenvalues. From (2.1) we have \u033a(y)V\u03bb \u2286 V\u03bb\u22121 ; this and\northogonality of the eigenspaces imply that V = \u2295m\nj=0 V\u2212(\u03b7+j) and its orthocomplement are invariant\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n7\n\nunder \u033a. So, V is the whole space Cd , and we have proved that the the bundle is elementary. We\ncan write V(\u03b7+j) = Cdj and hence (\u033a, Cd ) is described by the two matrices:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212\u03b7I0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\u033a(h) = \uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n.\n\u2212(\u03b7 + m)Im\n\nwhere Ij is the identity matrix on Cdj and\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec Y1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nY2\nY := \u033a(y) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n..\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n\n..\n\n.\n\nYm\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0\n\nfor some choice of matrices Y1 , . . . , Ym that represent the linear transformations Yj : Cdj\u22121 \u2192 Cdj .\nLet E (\u03b7,Y ) denote the holomorphic bundle induced by this representation.\nIt is clear that \u033a can be written as the tensor product of the one dimensional representation \u03c3\ngiven by \u03c3(h) = \u2212\u03b7, \u03c3(y) = 0, and the representation \u033a0 given by \u033a0 (h) = \u033a(h) + \u03b7I, \u033a0 (y) = \u033a(y).\nCorrespondingly, the bundle E (\u03b7,Y ) for \u033a is the tensor product of a line bundle L\u03b7 and the bundle\ncorresponding to \u033a0 , that is, E (\u03b7,Y ) = L\u03b7 \u2297 E (0,Y ) .\n\u2202g\nFor g \u2208 G\u0303, g\u2032 (z) (we write g\u2032 (z) = \u2202z\n(z)) is a real analytic function on the simply connected set\nG\u0303 \u00d7 D, holomorphic in z. Also g \u2032 (z) 6= 0 since g is one-one and holomorphic. Given any \u03bb \u2208 R,\ntaking the principal branch of the power function when g is near the identity, we can uniquely define\ng\u2032 (z)\u03bb as a real analytic function on G\u0303 \u00d7 D which is holomorphic on D for all fixed g \u2208 G\u0303.\nFor the line bundle L\u03b7 , the multiplier is g\u2032 (z)\u03b7 . Consequently, the multiplier corresponding to the\noriginal \u033a is\n\u0001\u03b7\n(2.2)\nJg (z) = g \u2032 (z) Jg0 (z),\n\nwhere J 0 is the multiplier obtained from \u033a0 .\nThe advantage of \u033a0 is that it is also a representation of G (not only of G\u0303) and extends to a\nrepresentation of GC . The (ordinary) induced representation (in the holomorphic category) IndG\nT (\u033a)\noperates on functions F : GC \u2192 V such that F (gt) = \u033a0 (t)\u22121 F (g) (g \u2208 GC , t \u2208 T ). The restrictions of\nthese functions F to G then give exactly the functions \u03a6 : G \u2192 V which satisfy \u03a6(gk) = \u033a0 (k)\u22121 \u03a6(g)\n(g \u2208 GC , t \u2208 T ) and (X\u03a6)(g) = \u2212\u033a0 (X)\u03a6(g) (g \u2208 G, X \u2208 b), that is, the space of the representation\nholomorphically induced by \u033a0 . Taking a holomorphic local cross section p of GC defined on D, the\nfunctions f (z) = F (p(z)) give a trivialization of E (0,Y ) .\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 z\nWe use the local cross section p : D \u2192 GC , z 7\u2192 p(z):=\n.

Taking a small\nneighborhood \u0168 of the identity in G\u0303 such that the projection is a diffeomorphism onto a neighborhood\nU of the identity in G, by computing in U , we find that\ng\u2032\u2032 (z) = \u22122cg g\u2032 (z)3/2\n\n(2.5)\n\nholds with cg an analytic function of g on U , independent of z. This is then true for g \u2208 \u0168 and by\nanalytic continuation for all g \u2208 G\u0303. So the equation (2.5) can serve as a definition for cg .\nProposition 2.1. All elementary Hermitizable homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles are of the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nform E (\u03b7,Y ) with \u03b7 \u2208 R and Y as before. The bundles E (\u03b7,Y ) and E (\u03b7 ,Y ) are isomorphic if and only\nif \u03b7 = \u03b7 \u2032 and Y \u2032 = AY A\u22121 with a block diagonal matrix A.\nProof. The induced bundles are isomorphic if and only if the inducing representations \u033a, \u033a\u2032 are\nlinearly equivalent, that is, \u033a\u2032 = A\u033aA\u22121 for some A. Since we have normalized the representations\nby fixing the matrix \u033a(h), the equivalence must be given by an A which commutes with \u033a(h), that\nis, by a block diagonal A.\n\u0003\nThus E (\u03b7,{Y }) = L\u03b7 \u2297 E ({Y }) parametrizes the equivalence classes of elementary Hermitizable\nhomogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. Here, we have let {Y } denote the conjugacy class of Y\nunder conjugation by a block diagonal matrix A.\n2.2. Homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles. We proceed to discuss homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles. From here on we will always use the trivialization we just described. We will not always make a careful distinction between a section of E (\u03b7,Y ) and the functions\n(\u03b7,Y )\nfrom D to Cd on which G acts by the multiplier Jg\n(z). As in Section 1, a Hermitian structure\nappears in the trivialization as a family of quadratic forms hH(z)\u03be, \u03bei, which because of the homogeneity is determined by a single positive definite block-diagonal matrix H = H(0). We denote by\n(E (\u03b7,Y ) , H) the bundle E (\u03b7,Y ) equipped with the Hermitian structure determined by H.\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nProposition 2.2. The Hermitian vector bundles (E (\u03b7,Y ) , H) and (E (\u03b7 ,Y ,) , H \u2032 ) are isomorphic if\nand only if \u03b7 = \u03b7 \u2032 , Y \u2032 = AY A\u22121 and H \u2032 = A\u2217 \u22121 HA with a block diagonal matrix A.\nProof. The trivialization of the sections obtained by starting with \u033a (resp. \u033a\u2032 = A\u033aA\u22121 ) are related\nas f \u2032 (z) = Af (z). Now, H \u2032 (z) gives the same metric as H(z) if and only if hH \u2032 (z)f \u2032 (z), f \u2032 (z)i =\nhH(z)f (z), f (z)i. From this, the statement follows.\n\u0003\nFor any H, clearly there is an A such that A\u2217 \u22121 HA = I. This means that every elementary\nhomogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle is isomorphic to one of the form (E (\u03b7,Y , I). Two\nvector bundles of this form are equivalent if and only if Y \u2032 = AY A\u22121 with A such that A\u2217\u22121 IA\u22121 =\nI, that is, with a block-diagonal unitary A. We denote by [Y ] the equivalence class of Y under\nconjugation by block-diagonal unitaries and write E (\u03b7,[Y ]) for the equivalence class of (E (\u03b7,Y ) , I),\nomitting the I. We now have the first half of the following Proposition.\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n9\n\nProposition 2.3. For \u03b7 \u2208 R, [Y ] a block unitary conjugacy class of matrices Y , the vector bundles E (\u03b7,[Y ]) form a parametrization of the elementary homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector\nbundles. The Hermitian vector bundle E (\u03b7,[Y ]) is irreducible if and only if Y cannot be split into\northogonal direct sum Y \u2032 \u2295 Y \u2032\u2032 with Y \u2032 , Y \u2032\u2032 having the same block diagonal form as Y .\nProof. The last statement follows since the irreducibility of E (\u03b7,[Y ]) is the same as the possibility of\nsplitting \u033a into an orthogonal direct sum of two sub-representations.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.3, with a different proof, also appears in [3].\nThe following Theorem is important because its hypothesis is exactly what we know about the\nvector bundle corresponding to a homogeneous operator in the Cowen-Douglas class Bn (D). It was\nstated in [7] but proved without the uniqueness statement. Here we give a complete proof.\nTheorem 2.1. Let E be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle over D and suppose that for all\ng \u2208 G, there exists an automorphism of E whose action on D coincides with g. Then the full\nautomorphism group of E is reductive and G\u0303 acts on E by automorphisms in a unique way.\nProof. Let \u011c denote the connected component of the automorphism group of E. It is a Lie group\nbecause it is the connected component of the isometry group of E under the Riemannian metric\ndefined for vectors tangent to the fibres by the Hermitian structure and for vectors horizontal with\nrespect to the Hermitian connection by the G-invariant metric of D.\nLet N \u2286 \u011c be the subgroup of elements acting on D as the identity map. The subgroup N is\nnormal, and the projection \u03c0 : \u011c \u2192 G is a homomorphism with kernel N . Let K be the stabilizer of\n0 in G and let K\u0302 = \u03c0 \u22121 (K). The group K\u0302 contains N and is compact because it is the stabilizer of\nthe origin in the fiber over 0.\nLet \u011d, g, k, n, k\u0302 be the Lie algebras of the groups defined above, and let g = k + p be the Cartan\ndecomposition. Since K\u0302 is compact, we can choose an Ad(K\u0302) - invariant complement p\u0302 to k\u0302 in \u011d. Now,\n\u03c0\u2217 maps k\u0302 onto k with kernel n. By counting dimension, it follows that \u03c0\u2217 maps p\u0302 to p bijectively.\nWe set k\u03020 = [p\u0302, p\u0302]. Then \u03c0\u2217 (k\u03020 ) = [\u03c0\u2217 p\u0302, \u03c0\u2217 p\u0302] = k, therefore k\u03020 \u2286 \u03c0\u2217\u22121 (k) = k\u0302. It follows that\n[k\u03020 , p\u0302] \u2286 p\u0302 and by the Jacobi identity, \u011d0 = k\u03020 + p\u0302 is a subalgebra. Similarly, [n, p\u0302] \u2286 p\u0302 since n \u2286 k\u0302.\nBut n is an ideal, so [n, p] = 0, and by the Jacobi identity [n, \u011d0 ] = 0. Finally, \u011d = n \u2295 \u011d0 and g is\nreductive. The analytic subgroup \u011c0 \u2286 \u011c corresponding to \u011d0 is a covering group of G and therefore\nit acts on E by automorphisms. It is the unique subgroup of \u011c with this property because \u011d0 , being\nthe maximal semisimple ideal in the reductive algebra \u011d, is uniquely determined. The action of \u011c0\nnow lifts to a unique action of G\u0303.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.1 implies that every homogeneous operator in the Cowen-Douglas class Bn (D) has an\nassociated representation irrespective of whether it is irreducible or not. The following Corollary has\nalso appeared in [3].\nCorollary 2.1. If a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle E is homogeneous and is reducible (E =\nE1 \u2295 E2 ) as a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle then it is reducible as a homogeneous Hermitian\nholomorphic vector bundle, that is, E1 and E2 are also homogeneous.\nProof. We consider the automorphisms exp th of E, where\n(\niI\non E1\nh=\n\u2212iI on E2 .\nThen h is in n since exp th (t \u2208 R) preserves fibres. So, h commutes with \u011d0 . The sections of\nE1 , E2 are characterized as eigensections of h corresponding to different eigenvalues. Thus \u011c0 , and\nits universal covering G\u0303 preserve the eigensections of h.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nADAM KOR\u00c1NYI AND GADADHAR MISRA\n\n3. Homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles with reproducing kernel\nIn this Section, we determine which ones of the elementary homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian\nvector bundles have their Hermitian structure coming from a reproducing kernel. In other words,\nwhich are the homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles that have a G\u0303 - invariant reproducing kernel\nK(z, w). When there is a reproducing kernel K, it gives a canonical Hermitian structure by setting\n(\u03b7,Y )\n(\u03b7,Y )\nfor Jpz (z), we have\nH = K(0, 0)\u22121 . Let pz = \u221a 1 2 ( 1z\u0304 z1 ) \u2208 G, so pz * 0 = z. Writing Jz\n1\u2212|z|\n\n\u2217\n\nK(z, z) = Jz(\u03b7,Y ) K(0, 0)Jz(\u03b7,Y ) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nSo, the question amounts to enumeration of all the possibilities for K(0, 0).\n3.1. An intertwining map. For \u03bb > 0, let A(\u03bb) be the Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on the\nunit disc with reproducing kernel (1 \u2212 z w\u0304))\u22122\u03bb . It corresponds to the homogeneous line bundle\nL\u03bb . The group G\u0303 acts on it unitarily with the multiplier g\u2032 (z). This action is the Discrete series\ndj\n(\u03bb)\nrepresentation Dg . Let Cd = \u2295j=0\nCdj . We think of functions f : D \u2192 Cd as having components\n(\u03b7+j) \u2297 Cdj . For \u03b7 > 0, Y as before and f \u2208 A(\u03b7+j) \u2297 Cdj , define\nfj : D \u2192 Cdj .

Let N be an invertible d \u00d7 d block diagonal matrix with\nblocks Nj , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m, d = d0 + * * * + dm . We will assume throughout that N0 = Id0 . This is only a\nnormalizing condition. We can normalize further by assuming that each block diagonal matrix with\ndj \u00d7 dj blocks Nj is positive definite but this is not important. We can think of N as changing the\n(\u03b7,Y )\n(\u03b7,Y )\ndenote\n= \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) \u25e6 N and HN\nnatural inner product of each Cdj to hNj u, Nj viCdj .

The vector bundles\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u03b7\u2032 ,Y \u2032 )\n(\u03b7,Y )\n(0, 0))\u22121 are equivalent if and only if \u03b7 = \u03b7 \u2032 , Y \u2032 =\nE (\u03b7,Y ) , (KN (0, 0))\u22121 and E (\u03b7 ,Y ) , (KN \u2032\nAY A\u22121 and N \u2032 N \u2032 \u2217 = AN N \u2217 A\u2217 for some invertible block diagonal matrix A of size d \u00d7 d.\nProof. The existence of a reproducing kernel implies that the vector bundle is Hermitizable. Such a\nbundle is of the form (E (\u03b7,Y ) , H) by Propositions 2.1 and 2.2. When it has a reproducing kernel, then\nin our canonical trivialization this is a matrix valued function K(z, w), and we have H = K(0, 0)\u22121 .\n(\u03b7,Y )\nThe G\u0303 action U which is now unitary, is given by the multiplier Jg\n(z). The equation (2.4) shows\n\n\f12\n\nADAM KOR\u00c1NYI AND GADADHAR MISRA\n\nthat the action of K\u0303 is diagonalized by the polynomial vectors: If vj \u2208 Cdj and f (z) = z n vj , then\nfor k\u03b8 such that k\u03b8 (z) = ei\u03b8 z, we have Uk\u03b8 f = ei\u03b8(\u03b7+j+k) f . It follows that U is a direct sum of the\nDiscrete series representations D (\u03b7+j) , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m. In particular, it follows that \u03b7 > 0.\n(\u03b7,Y )\nfor any block diagonal N ) intertwines the representations U and\nThe map \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) (and \u0393N\n(\u03b7+j) , both of which are unitary.

This proves that the bundle E (\u03b7,Y ) corresponds to the Hilbert space HN .\nThe statement about equivalence follows from the analogous statement in Proposition 2.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. In the proof we only used the unitarizability of the G\u0303 action on the sections of the\nHermitizable bundle E. In this vein, an even more general result holds:\nFor any G\u0303 - homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle E, if the G\u0303 action on the sections is unitariz(\u03b7,Y )\nable then it is a direct sum of bundles corresponding to some HN . (The possible unitary structures\ncorrespond to different choices of N .)\nOne way to prove this is to use the \"Inverse propagation theorem\" of T. Kobayashi [6]. If the\naction of G\u0303 is unitary, then so is the K\u0303 action on the fibres, and we are back in the situation of\nTheorem 3.2.\nHere we sketch a more direct proof which also shows what the non-Hermitizable homogeneous\nholomorphic vector bundles are like.\nA general E is still gotten from two matrices Z = \u033a(h), Y = \u033a(y) such that [Z, Y ] = \u2212Y by\nholomorphic induction. The inclusion Y V\u03bb \u2286 V\u03bb\u22121 still holds for the generalized eigenspaces of Z.\nUsing some easy identities for g\u2032 (z), we can then verify that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nJg (z) = exp 12 (log(g\u2032 (z))\u2032 Y exp \u2212 log g \u2032 (z)Z ,\nwhich, in the case where Z is diagonal, is just another way to write (3.2), is a multiplier.\nWriting Ug for the action of G\u0303 on Hol(D, V ) given by Jg (z), we compute\n\u0001\nUexp tih f (z) = exp(itZ)f (e\u2212it z).\n\n(3.5)\n\nHence (Uh f )(0) = Zf (0) and by a similar computation (Uy f )(0) = Y f (0). This shows that Jg (z)\ngives a trivialization of our E. It also shows that Uk , k \u2208 K\u0303 maps the spaces Mp of monomials of\ndegree p to Mp for all p \u2265 0. Hence K\u0303 - finite vectors are exactly the (V - valued) polynomials.\nNow if U is unitary with respect to some inner product, then it is a sum of irreducible representations. The K\u0303-types of these (i.e. the eigenfunctions of Uh ) are known to be one dimensional and\ntogether they span the space of K\u0303 - finite vectors. By (3.5), Uh maps any z p v \u2208 Mp to z p (Zv \u2212 pv).\nIt follows that Z must be diagonalizable, otherwise the eigenfunctions of Uh could not span Mp .\n3.2. Parametrization. The description of the homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles\ngiven in Theorem 3.2 can be made more explicit. We now proceed to determine, in terms of the\nparametrization E (\u03b7,[Y ]) of elementary homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles as in\nProposition 2.3, exactly which ones of these have their Hermitian structure come from a reproducing\nkernel.\nTheorem 3.3. The Hermitian structure of E (\u03b7,[Y ]) comes from a (G\u0303 - invariant) reproducing kernel\nif and only if \u03b7 > 0 and\nI \u2212 Yj\nfor j = 1, 2, . . . , m.\n\nj\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0001 \u2217\n(\u22121)j+k\n\u2217\n\u2217\n* * * Yj\u22121\nYj\u22121 * * * Yk+1 Yk+1\nYj > 0\n(j \u2212 k)!(2\u03b7 + j + k \u2212 1)j\u2212k\n\nProof.

It obviously holds when \u03b7 is large. We can also see that there exists a number\n\u03b7Y > 0 such that it holds if and only if \u03b7 > \u03b7Y . For this we only have to see that if E (\u03b7,Y ) has a\nreproducing kernel for some \u03b7 > 0, then so does E (\u03b7+\u03b5,Y ) for all \u03b5 > 0.

Classification of the homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class\nThe following theorem together with Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, and Corollary 2.1 gives a complete\nclassification of homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class.\nTheorem 4.1. All the homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles with a reproducing kernel\ncorrespond to homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class. The irreducible ones are the\n(\u03b7,Y )\nfor some \u03b7 > 0 and irreducible Y . The\nadjoint of the multiplication operator M on the space HI\nblock matrix Y is determined up to conjugacy by block diagonal unitaries.\nProof. First we note that by Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 every homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector\nbundle can be written in the form (E \u03b7,Y , I) with \u03b7 > 0. The Hilbert space HI\u03b7,Y is a subspace of the\n(\u03b7,Y )\nof A(\u03b7) . We\n(trivialized) holomorphic sections of (E \u03b7,Y , I) which is the image under the map \u0393N\n(\u03b7,Y )\nbelongs to the Cowen-Doulas class. For this we\nhave to show only that the operator M \u2217 on HI\ncompute the matrix of M in an appropriate orthonormal basis.\nEach of the Hilbert spaces A(\u03b7+j) (0 \u2264 j \u2264 m) has a natural orthonormal basis\nr\no\nn\n(2\u03b7 + 2j)n n\nn\nz :n\u22650 .\nej (z) :=\nn!\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\nHence A(\u03b7+j) \u2297 Cdj has the basis enj \u03b5q , where {\u03b5q : 1 \u2264 q \u2264 dj } is the natural basis of Cdj . The\n(j)\n\nHilbert space A(\u03b7) then has the orthonormal basis enj \u03b5jq with \u03b5jq := \u03b5j \u2297 \u03b5q , where {\u03b5j : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m}\nis the natural basis for Cm+1 . Each enj \u03b5jq is a function on D taking values in Cd ; its part in Cdj is\n(j)\n\n\u03b5j \u2297 \u03b5q , and its part in every other Cdk (k 6= j) is 0. Defining\n\u0001\nenjq := \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) enj \u03b5jq ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwe have an orthonormal basis for H(\u03b7,Y ) .\nWe identify the \"K -types\" in H(\u03b7,Y ) , that is, the subspaces on which the representation U\n(\u03b7+j)\nrestricted to K\u0303 acts by scalars. For k\u03b8 \u2208 K\u0303 given by k\u03b8 (z) = ei\u03b8 z, we have Dk\u03b8 enj = e\u2212i\u03b8(\u03b7+j+n) enj\non A(\u03b7+j) . By the intertwining property of \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) , the basis elements of H(\u03b7,Y ) then satisfy Uk\u03b8 enjq =\ne\u2212i\u03b8(\u03b7+j+n) enjq . It follows that the subspace\nH(\u03b7,Y ) (n) := {f \u2208 H(\u03b7,Y ) : Uk\u03b8 f = e\u2212i\u03b8(\u03b7+n) f }\nn\u2212j\nis spanned by the basis elements {ejq\n: 1 \u2264 q \u2264 dj , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 min(m, n)} and H(\u03b7,Y ) equals the\ndirect sum \u2295n\u22650 H(\u03b7,Y ) (n).\nClearly, the operator M maps each H(\u03b7,Y ) (n) to H(\u03b7,Y ) (n + 1). We write M (n) for the matrix of\nthe restriction of M to H(\u03b7,Y ) (n), that is,\nX\nn\u2212j\nn+1\u2212l\nM ejq\n=\nM (n)(lr)(jq) elr\n.\n(4.2)\nl,r\n\nn\u2212j\nn\u2212j\nWe write e(jq),(st)\n(z) for the (s, t) - component (0 \u2264 s \u2264 min(m, n), 1 \u2264 t \u2264 ds ) of the function ejq\n\ntaking values in Cd . This can be regarded as a matrix of monomials in z. The coefficients of these\nmonomials form a numerical matrix which we denote by E(n).\nApplying the operator M , which is multiplication by z, to the monomials does not change their\ncoefficients. Therefore, equation (4.2) amounts to the matrix equality\nE(n) = E(n + 1)M (n).\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n15\n\nWe use (4.1) to compute E(n) explicitly.

To prove the forward direction, first we show that \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) maps A(\u03b7) onto itself, that is,\n(\u03b7,Y )\nd\n: A(\u03b1) \u2192 A(\u03b1+1) defines a surjective bounded linear\nas linear spaces.

The functions f0 , . . . , fd are determined recursively.\nSuppose, we have already determined fj , j < l. Then from the definition of the map \u0393(\u03b7,Y ) , we see\nthat taking\nl\u22121\nX\n(\u0393(\u03b7,Y ) fj )l\nfl = gl \u2212\nj=0\n\n(\u03b7,Y )\n\n(\u03b7,Y )\n\nvia the map\n\u2192 HI\nwe have the required f . Clearly, M : A(\u03b7) \u2192 A(\u03b7) is similar to M : HI\nf 7\u2192 f , which is bounded and invertible by the Closed graph theorem.\n(\u03b7+j) be the linear span of the\nFor the proof in the other direction, let K(n) \u2286 A(\u03b7) = \u2295m\nj=0 dj A\nvectors {enjq : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 dj }. The multiplication operator M on A(\u03b7) maps K(n) into\nK(n + 1). If Mn is the matrix representing M| K(n) : K(n) \u2192 K(n + 1) then M is a block shift with\nblocks {Mn : n \u2265 0}, which are diagonal matrices of size d\u00d7d. Let M \u2032 be the multiplication operator\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 (\u03b7\u2032 +j) with a similar block decomposition.

Then d = d0 + * * * + dm = codim(ran M ) = codim(ran M \u2032 ) = d\u20320 + * * * + d\u2032m\u2032 .\nIt then follows that L0k = 0 for all k \u2265 1 and consequently L00 is non-singular.

A homogeneous operator in the Cowen-Dougls class is either similar to a contraction or it is not power bounded.\n\n\fCLASSIFICATION OF HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS\n\n17\n\n5. Examples\nIn this last Section, we discuss how some formerly known examples fit into the present framework.\n5.1. The case of d0 = d1 = * * * = dm = 1. This case was already studied in [7]. Here each Yj is a\nnumber, non-zero in the irreducible case. The unitaries implementing the equivalence are diagonal,\nand clearly the conjugacy class [Y ] under these has exactly one representative with yj > 0, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m.\nThe positive m + 1 - tuples satisfying the condition given in Theorem 3.3 give a parametrization\n(\u03b7,Y )\nof homogeneous Cowen-Douglas operators. For each one, K(0, 0) = I and Jg\nis given by the\nformula (2.4).\nAnother good parametrization is possible with the aid of Theorem 3.1. All possible Y -s are now\nconjugate under diagonal unitaries A, so we may fix an arbitrary Y (0) (for example, yj = 1 for\nall j, or, as in [7], yj = j for all j). Take any positive diagonal matrix N with diagonal elements\n1 = \u03bc0 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcm . By Proposition 2.2, Y (0) , N and Y (0) , N \u2032 give isomorphic vector bundles if\nand only if A is diagonal and hence N = N \u2032 . It follows that the positive numbers \u03b7, \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcm\ngive a parametrization of the homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class Bm+1 (D). Here\n(\u03b7,Y (0) )\n\n(\u03b7,Y (0) )\n\n(0, 0) is given by the formula in Theorem 3.1. This is the\nJg\ndepends only on \u03b7 and KN\nparametrization used in [7].\nIn the case m = 1, for any d0 and d1 , the class [Y ] always contains a member for which Y is\ndiagonal. So, the corresponding bundle is reducible unless d0 = d1 = 1. When m = 2, it is easy to\nsee that d0 = 2 or d2 = 2 gives only reducible bundles. So, the first non-trivial case occurs (apart\nfrom the case d0 = d1 = d2 = 1, which has been dealt with previously) when d0 = d2 = 1, d1 = 2.\n5.2. The case of (d0 , d1 , d2 ) = (1, 2, 1). For this case, again there are two natural parametrizations.\n\u22121\nConjugating Y with a block-diagonal unitary \u0010having\n\u0011 blocks u0 , U1 , u2 changes Y1 , Y2 into U1 Y1 u0 ,\na\n\nu2 Y2 U1\u22121 . Now, U1 can be chosen so that Y1 = 0 . Then u0 , u2 and a scalar factor in front of U1 can\n\u0001\nbe found with a \u2265 0 and Y = b c with b, c \u2265 0. We have irreducibility if and only if a, b, c 6= 0 and\nno two such triples give equivalent Y -s. So, we have a parametrization of the irreducible E (\u03b7,Y ) by\nfour arbitrary non-zero parameters. There is a reproducing kernel (and hence an operator in B4 (D))\nif and only if the the right hand side of the equation (3.7) is positive; in terms of the parameters,\nthis is\na2 < 2\u03b7\nb2 <\n\n2\u03b7 + 2\n1\u2212\n\na2\n2(2\u03b7+1)\n\nc2 < 2\u03b7 + 2\nThe positive quadruple (\u03b7, a, b, c) subject to this condition parametrizes the homogeneous operators\nin B4 (D). In each case, K(0, 0) = I and Jg can be expressed in terms of the parameters using (2.4).\nThe other parametrization of the (d0 , d1 , d2 ) = (1, 2, 1) case is found using Theorem 3.1.\u0010 Simple\n\u0011\n1\narguments show that Y can always be conjugated by a block diagonal A so that Y1 =\nand\n0\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 , \u0011the bundle will be reducible for any choice of Hermitian\nY2 = 1 0 or 0 1 .

The block diagonal A that conjugates\n0\n\nthis Y (0) to itself is a diagonal matrix with (p, p, q, p) on the diagonal. If N is any positive diagonal\n\u0010\u03b1 \u03b2 \u0011\nand n2 \u2265 0, then we can ensure n1 = 1 = n2 and\ndiag (n0 , N1 , n2 ) with n0 = 1, N1 =\n\u03b2\u0304 \u03b3\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 > 0 after conjugating by an A. Thus the homogeneous bundles with reproducing kernel (and\nhence the homogeneous operators in B4 (D)) of type (1, 2, 1) are now parametrized by four positive\nnumbers (\u03b7, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) subject to the condition \u03b2 2 < \u03b1\u03b3.\nBy a different construction, a large subset of these examples already occurs in [12].\n\n\f18\n\nADAM KOR\u00c1NYI AND GADADHAR MISRA\n\nReferences\n1.
