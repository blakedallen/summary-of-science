Magnetic ordering is observed above about 1.0\nGPa, being the lowest pressure in Yb-intermetallics showing pressure induced magnetic ordering.\nUnexpectedly, ordering disappears above about 4.0 GPa, giving rise to the first observation of the\nappearance of two quantum critical points persisting in a broad range of pressure within a single\nmaterial.\nPACS numbers: Valid PACS appear here\n\nA critical temperature where some kind of ordered\nstate changes to disorder can be controlled by several parameters, e.g., pressure, chemical substitution and magnetic field, and the point where the critical temperature\nis tuned to absolute zero temperature is called a quantum\ncritical point (QCP). At the QCP, quantum fluctuations\ndevelop, inducing a variety of unusual electronic properties. Many investigations have already been carried out\nto understand quantum criticality in strongly correlated\nelectron systems.\nAmong them, several Ce based intermetallic compounds were studied under applied pressure and magnetic fields in order to analyze the properties right at\nthe QCP. In general, the magnetic phase transition of\nCe compounds can be tuned towards the QCP by the\napplication of external pressure. In the proximity of the\nQCP, strong deviations from Landau Fermi liquid behavior due to the low energy and extended spin fluctuations\nare observed. Some of such systems, e.g., CeCu2 Ge2 [1],\nCeRhIn5 [2], CePt3 Si[3] and CeRhSi3 [4], show even exotic\nsuperconductivity with the possibility of a magnetically\nmediated pairing mechanism, enhanced at the QCP.\nThis suppression of the magnetic transition temperature in Ce-intermetallic compounds by applying pressure is well described by a competition between RKKY\nand Kondo interaction. In contrast, the application of\npressure to Yb-based intermetallic compounds may induce the magnetically ordered phase. Examples here\nare e.g. YbCu2 Si2 [5,6], YbNi2 Ge2 [7], Yb2 Ni2 Al[8] and\nYbCuAl[9]. The reason of which can be explained by\na change of the valence, driving divalent non-magnetic\nYb2+ (4f14 ) towards the trivalent magnetic Yb3+ (4f13 )\nstate owing to a reduction of the unit cell volume. Note,\nthe volume associated with the 4f14 configuration is larger\nthat that of magnetic 4f13 . Quantum criticality on anti-\n\nferromagnetically ordered YbRh2 Si2 , with a very low ordering temperature TN = 65 mK, was well studied by precise magnetic field dependent measurements [10]. In general, however, the critical pressure to accomplish quantum criticality in most of the Yb-compounds investigated\nis located at quite high pressure, above 5 GPa [5,6,7,8,9].\nFor that reason, precise properties at the QCP in Yb\ncompounds are still an open question, because probes\nsatisfying the experimental requirements for both low\ntemperature measurements (below 1 K) and high pressure (above 5 GPa) are quite limited to a few methods,\ne.g., the diamond-anvil-cell (DAC) or a Bridgman type\npressure cell assembled to a dilution refrigerator.\nResuming our recent investigations regarding Yb compounds, the present study focuses on Yb2 Pd2 Sn, one\nend member of solid solution Yb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx [11,12].\nYb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx crystallizes in the tetragonal Mo2 FeB2 type in which alternating layers of Yb and the other one\nmade of Pd and Sn stack sequentially along c-axis. With\nrespect to Yb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx , both border compounds remain non-magnetic, while long range magnetic order appears in a narrow concentration range from about x =\n0.6 to x = 0.9 without changing the crystal structure. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of a single series with the possibility of two QCPs.\nThis characteristic feature might be attributed to both\nchemical pressure onto the Yb ion by substituting In by\nSn having different ionic radii, and the non-isoelectronic\ncharacter of the In/Sn substitution.\nIn Ref. [11], the pressure effect on one border compound, Yb2 Pd2 Sn, of the series Yb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx has\nbeen investigated by measuring the electrical resistivity,\n\u03c1, up to 1.7 GPa. \u03c1(T ) of Yb2 Pd2 Sn exhibits at ambihigh\nent pressure two broad maxima at around Tmax\n\u223c 200\nlow\nlow\nK and about Tmax \u223c 11 K. Tmax is concerned with the\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity normalized by the resistivity at 300 K of\nYb2 Pd2 Sn at various pressures. Magnetic transition temperatures TM are indicated by arrows. The anomalies observed\nbetween 10 and 20 K are not intrinsic and occur due to the\nfluctuation of the inner pressure of clamped-type pressure cell\nthrough temperature change.\n\ncharacteristic temperature where a coherent Kondo effect starts to develop with decreasing temperature, while\nhigh\nTmax\nis caused by incoherent Kondo scattering under\nthe influence of crystalline electric field (CEF) splitting\nof the 4f state of the Yb ion. Both features are typically observed in Yb and Ce intermetallics. However, no\nsigns of long range magnetic order were observed within\nthe measurement range (1.5 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K and 0 GPa\n\u2264 P \u2264 1.7 GPa) studied. The aim of the present paper is searching for new QCPs located within a pressure\nregion, accessible for more experimental methods. Attempting to observe pressure induced magnetic ordering\nin Yb2 Pd2 Sn, we measured the temperature dependent\nelectrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) at higher pressures, above 1.7\nGPa, and at lower temperatures, below 1.5 K.\nA polycrystalline sample of Yb2 Pd2 Sn was prepared\nfrom stoichiometric amounts of elements by high frequency melting the constituent materials in a closed tantalum crucible. A subsequent heat treatment at 1250\nK for one week served to ensure phase purity. Syn5\nthesized Yb2 Pd2 Sn crystallizes with the D4h\ntetragonal\nspace group. The 4h site occupied by Yb has a low mm\npoint symmetry. To achieve a wider pressure range with\nhigh resolution of resistivity data, we employed a DAC\nand embedded the conductive electrodes into the sample\nspace for a four-probe electrical resistivity measurement.\nThe sample and some small ruby chips were clamped in\nthe sample space with NaCl as a pressure transmitting\nmedium. Determination of the pressure value was carried out by the ruby fluorescence method at about 20 K.\nPressure distribution in the sample was within about 10\n% and pressure change from room temperature to 30 K\nis smaller than 0.5 GPa. The DAC was then assembled\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Close-up plot of temperature dependence of the electical resistivity normalized at 300 K near the\nmagnetic ordering temperature of Yb2 Pd2 Sn. Inset shows the\nanomaly observed at 3.5 GPa.\n\nin the 3 He/4 He dilution refrigerator, and the sample was\ncooled down to 70 mK. Other details of the DAC experiment are given in ref. 13.\nFig.1.shows \u03c1(T ) normalized by the resistivity at 300 K\nat several pressures. Overall feature of the \u03c1(T )/\u03c1(300K)\nis characterized by a negative logarithmic behavior which\noriginates from the dominant contribution of magnetic\nscattering to the resistivity in Yb2 Pd2 Sn. At lowest pressure of 0.3 GPa, two broad maxima are observed as often\nseen in heavy fermion compounds. The broad low temlow\nperature maximum Tmax\nreflects coherent Kondo interaction and it is regarded as a measure of the Kondo temperature TK [14]. The broad high temperature maximum\nhigh\nTmax\nis caused by the incoherent Kondo effect under the\ninfluence of CEF splitting of the 4f13 -electronic state.\nAt 1.0 K and 1.1 K in 1.7 GPa and 2.5 GPa, respectively, we found a kink-like anomaly, indicated by arrows in Fig.1 and Fig.2. Also at 3.5 GPa, a tiny kink at\n0.4 K is observed (inset of Fig.2), disappearing under a\nsmall magnetic field of 0.5 T. The overall shapes of \u03c1(T )\nat 1.7 GPa and 2.5 GPa are rather similar to that of\nYb2 Pd2 In0.2 Sn0.8 , [11] where the occurrence of bulk antiferromagnetic order is confirmed by various measurements. Therefore, we conclude that the anomaly observed reflects the onset temperature TM of magnetic order, triggered by the emergence of the full trivalent state\nof Yb under compression of the unit cell volume. The enhancement of the resistivity below TM can be explained\nin terms of a superzone boundary effect owing to the\nquasi-2D crystal structure of Yb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx . Below\nTM , the electrical resistivity rises due to the decrement\nof the 4f hole career density as a consequence of nesting\nat the Fermi energy EF . The ambiguity at TM is presumably attributed to the unexpected rapid change of TM by\npressure and/or the inevitable pressure distribution in\nthe sample.\nThe field response of \u03c1(T ) at 2.5 GPa for H \u22a5 I is\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity normalized at 300 K at 2.5 GPa under magnetic\nfields. Magnetic transition temperatures are indicated by arrows. Solid lines are fitting results by equation \u03c1 = \u03c10 + AT n .\nSee text for details.\n\nshown in Fig.3. Yb2 Pd2 Sn exhibits a negative magnetoresistance at least for fields up to 8.0 T and the total reduction of resistivity is about 40 % at the lowest\ntemperature. TM decreases from 1.1 K to 0.9 K at 0 T\nand 1.0 T, respectively, and the further application of\nmagnetic fields causes the anomaly to disappear, at least\nabove 120 mK. This rapid suppression and suppression of\nTM by magnetic fields can be described as an almost unambiguous signature of antiferromagnetic ordering. The\n\u03c1(T ) at 3.0 T obeys the power law of \u03c1 = \u03c10 + T 1.6 , indicating a field derived non-Fermi liquid state. Further\napplying magnetic fields up to 8.0 T, the exponent of\nthe power law below 3 K increases to 1.8. This might\nrefer to a crossover from a non-Fermi liquid to a field induced Fermi liquid ground state, which would follow the\nequation \u03c1 = \u03c10 + T 2 .\nFig.4(a) illustrates the pressure-temperature phase dilow\nagram of Yb2 Pd2 Sn obtained from TM and Tmax\nof the\nresistivity measurement. As TM is not observed at 0.3\nGPa but at 1.7 GPa, the magnetic ordering is induced at\naround 1.0 GPa and it disappears at the pressure slightly\nbelow 4.0 GPa. In the pressure range from 1.0 to 4.0\nlow\nGPa, Tmax\nis not observed and the shape of the resistivity curve changes to the shoulder. Increasing pressure\nabove 4.0 GPa, the maximum emerges again, presumably\ndue to the loss of magnetic ordering. This feature can be\nexplained by the opposite pressure dependence of TK and\nTM . For lower pressure it is expected that TK decreases\nwith pressure, as generally observed in Yb-intermetallics,\nreaching a minimum around 2.5 Gpa, before increasing\nagain above 4.0 GPa. Within the magnetically ordered\nphase TK is not estimated. Contrary to this pressure tendency of TK , TM shows a maximum at around 2.0 GPa,\nwhere TM is expected to exceed TK This mutual behavior of TK and TM is quite similar to the solid solution\n\nFIG. 4:\n(color online) (a) Pressure-temperature phasediagram of magnetic ordering temperature and the low temperature maximum of Yb2 Pd2 Sn. Solid and dotted lines are\nlow\ndrawn for eye-guide. Tmax\nis not observed at 1.7, 2.5 and 3.5\nGPa. However, the line passes through below TM , because\nlow\nTmax\n's are not seen at least above TM . (b) Pressure dependence of the residual resistivity normalized by the resistivity\nat 300 K. Solid line is for eye guide.\n\nYb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx and this might provide corroborative\nevidence regarding the existence of long range magnetic\norder. Additionally, similar relationships are generally\nrecognized in other studies concerning Yb compounds in\nwhich TK decreases before saturating towards a maximum pressure in the magnetically ordered phase. This\nfeature is also confirmed theoretically [15]. The maximum TM of about 1.1 K is smaller than that derived\nby chemical substitution in Yb2 Pd2 In1\u2212x Snx . This fact\nmight originate from some pressure inhomogneities due\nto NaCl used as pressure transmitting medium, or from\ndifferences of EF when substituting Sn by In which is\nexpected to lower EF . The suppression of TM and associated increase of TK above 2.5 GPa is similar to the\npressure effect of Ce-based intermetallic compounds, i.e.,\nthe suppression of TM might occur due to a competition\nbetween RKKY interaction and Kondo effect, as generally observed in Ce intermetallics. The pressures where\neither magnetic ordering appears or vanishes at 0 K corresponds to a QCP and any other Ce or Yb based intermetallic compounds with two QCPs have not been\n\n\f4\nobserved so far. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first finding of a system with two QCPs originated by magnetic ordering in a heavy fermion system.\nIn addition, it is surprising that both QCPs occur at a\ncomparable low pressure region below, 4.0 GPa.\nIn Fig.4(b), the pressure dependence of the residual\nresistivity normalized by the resistivity at 300K, \u03c1n0 =\n\u03c10 /\u03c1300K , is plotted. Obviously, TM and \u03c1n0 match each\nother as a function of pressure. Particularly, \u03c1n0 takes\nlarger values where magnetic ordering occurs. In general,\n\u03c10 can be expressed by \u03c10 = (~/e2 l)(3\u03c0 2 )1/3 n\u22122/3 , where\nl is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density. From this equation it follows that the enhancement\nof \u03c1n0 at about 2.0 GPa refers to either l or n must be\nreduced. The mean free path at low temperature limit,\nhowever, could not be affected by pressure, since it may\nbe determined by the imperfection of crystal lattice. The\nmaximum of \u03c1n0 might thus be attributed to a decrement\nof the carrier density. Such a change of the carrier density\nwould be in line with the occurrence of antiferromagentic\nordering, since there a partial opening of an energy gap at\nEF should emerge. However, it is also known that quantum fluctuations such as magnetic fluctuations increase\n\u03c10 at QCP as well [16,17]. That must be examined by\n\nfurther measurement in future experiments.\nIn summary, we found pressure induced magnetic ordering in Yb2 Pd2 Sn. Magnetic ordering is confirmed by\nthe response of TM to magnetic fields and the pressure delow\npendence of a specific relationship between TM and Tmax\n.\nCoincidence of two maxima of \u03c10 and TM also supports\nthe existence of a magnetically ordered state. Long range\nmagnetic order exists above about 1.0 GPa but disappears at about 4.0 GPa. This indicates that two QCPs\nexist in the pressure-temperature phase diagram. Such\na scenario is the first observation that two QCPs are observed within a single compound. Moreover, it is notable\nthat they are located at rather low pressures, offering\nthe proposition that other Yb compounds also have two\nQCPs in the low pressure region, which my stimulate\nfurther research in this field.\nWe thank K.
