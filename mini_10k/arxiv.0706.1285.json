INTRODUCTION\n\nThe baryonic content of the Universe is well constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis models, the cosmic\nmicrowave background, and the high-redshift Lyman-\u03b1\nforest (e.g., O'Meara et al. 2006; Spergel et al. 2006).\nHowever, surveys of the nearby Universe reveal a dearth\nof baryons in stars, galaxies, and clusters (Fukugita &\nPeebles 2004). Recent cosmological simulations have\nplaced the most likely reservoir of baryons at low redshift in moderately overdense, collisionally-ionized gas,\ncalled the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM; Dav\u00e9\net al. 2001; Fang & Bryan 2001; Cen et al. 2001). With\ntemperatures in the range 105 \u2013107 K, the most sensitive\ntracer with current observational facilities is the O VI\ndoublet \u03bb\u03bb1031, 1037 \u00c5, which dominates collisionallyionized gas at T \u2248 3 \u00d7 105 K, as discussed below.\nThe O VI doublet is a valuable absorption feature observationally because it has a characteristic separation\nand rest equivalent width (Wr ) ratio for unsaturated\nfeatures (2 : 1 for the \u03bb1031.93 : \u03bb1037.62 pair). Furthermore, oxygen is the most abundant metal, and the\nO+5 ion is an effective tracer of the low temperature\nWHIM (Tripp et al. 2006b). Assuming collisional ionization equilibrium, other ion species (e.g. O VIII, Mg X,\nNe VIII) have greater abundances in the higher WHIM\ntemperature range, where it is predicted there are more\n1 Department of Astronomy; University of California; 1156 High\nSt., Santa Cruz, CA 95064; kcooksey@ucolick.org\n2 UCO/Lick Observatory; University of California; 1156 High\nSt., Santa Cruz, CA 95064; xavier@ucolick.org\n3 Department of Astronomy; University of Chicago; 5640 S.

Cherry\nAve., Tucson, AZ 85721; bjw@as.arizona.edu\n\nbaryons; however, these other ions are extremely difficult\nto detect at low redshifts. Current X-ray telescopes are\nnot up to the task but for a few systems (Wang et al.\n2005; Williams et al. 2006; Nicastro et al. 2005).\nCosmological simulations make four important predictions about the content, temperature, ionization mechanism, and density of the WHIM. The WHIM contains\n\u223c 40% of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe (Dav\u00e9\net al. 2001; Cen et al. 2001). It has characteristic overdensity 10 . \u03b4 . 30 and is shock heated to T \u2248 105 \u2013\n107 K as it collapses onto large-scale structure (e.g., filaments; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001; Fang & Bryan 2001). The\nWHIM thermally emits soft X-rays; Dav\u00e9 et al. (2001)\nargue that the WHIM must be in a filamentary structure to agree with the soft X-ray background. Collisional\nionization dominates in high-temperature, high-density\nregions (e.g., WHIM), and photoionization dominates in\nlow-temperature, low-density regions (e.g., local Ly\u03b1 forest; Fang & Bryan 2001). Cen & Ostriker (2006) and Cen\n& Fang (2006) include new and improved prescriptions\nfor galactic super-winds and collisional non-equilibrium.\nTheir recent results substantiate previous simulations\nwhich argue for a large contribution of WHIM gas to\nthe baryonic census as well as demonstrate the importance of galactic super-winds in dispersing metals to large\ndistances from the galaxies, with impact parameters \u03c1\n\u2248 1 Mpc.\nSeveral observational papers propose that O VI absorption occurs in a multi-phase medium, with hot\ncollisionally-ionized components (105 . T . 107 K) and\nwarm photoionized components (T \u2248 104 K) (e.g. Tripp\net al. 2000; Simcoe et al. 2002; Shull et al. 2003; Sembach\net al. 2004a; Danforth et al. 2006). Other papers suggest that the O VI absorbers are in collisional ionization\nequilibrium (CIE; Richter et al. 2004), not in equilibrium\n\n\f2\n\nCooksey et al.\n\n(Tripp & Savage 2000), or photoionized and therefore not\npart of the WHIM (Prochaska et al. 2004). Richter et al.\n(2004) argue that broad Ly\u03b1 features can be used to trace\nthe WHIM if there are no O VI lines, and the simulations\nof Richter et al. (2006) indeed find broad Ly\u03b1 features\nat the redshift of O VI absorption.\nRecent observations have argued that O VI absorbers\nare often correlated with galaxies or galaxy groups (e.g.,\nRichter et al. 2004; Prochaska et al. 2004; Sembach et al.\n2004a). Typically, O VI absorbers are identified because\nLy\u03b1 absorbers were first identified at the corresponding redshifts. If O VI absorption were truly tracing the\nWHIM, the hydrogen should be predominantly ionized at\nT \u2248 105 K and therefore very broad and shallow due to\nthermal broadening, precluding easy detection (Richter\net al. 2004). This may explain the tendency to detect\nO VI absorbers near galaxies and to model the absorbers\nas a multi-phase medium. For this reason, Tripp et al.\n(2007) and the current study perform searches for O VI\ndoublets without first detecting Ly\u03b1.\nDanforth & Shull (2005) and Danforth et al. (2006,\nhereafter, DSRS06) surveyed the Hubble Space Telescope\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE ) archives for\nLy\u03b1, O VI, and C III \u03bb977. Of 45 Ly\u03b1 absorbers with\nstatistics for both metal lines, 12 (27%) have both O VI\nand C III absorption, 8 (18%) have O VI without C III,\nand 4 (9%) have C III without O VI. The prevalence\nof low-ionization absorption Ly\u03b1 and, often, C III associated with highly-ionized O VI absorption supports a\nmulti-phase model of the IGM. DSRS06 did not perform\na blind search for O VI without Ly\u03b1 absorbers.\nTripp et al. (2007) searched for H I and O VI absorption in archival STIS spectra of 16 low-redshift quasars.\nThe spectra were supplemented with FUSE data for\nsightlines with published complete line lists. Tripp et al.\n(2007) compared and contrasted 14 associated (those\nwithin 5000 km s\u22121 of the quasar) and 53 intervening H I\nand O VI absorption systems. From this survey, almost\nhalf of the intervening systems are multi-phase absorbers\nthat may host, at least in part, the WHIM, and more\nthan a third of the systems are cool, single-phase absorbers.\nPresented here is a detailed analysis of far-ultraviolet\nSTIS and FUSE spectra of the quasar PKS1302\u2013102\n(zQSO = 0.2784 \u00b1 0.0005, Corbett et al. 1998). Column\ndensities are measured for H I Lyman systems and metal\nlines. For systems with at least Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2, the H I\nDoppler parameter was measured. The redshift density\nof Ly\u03b1, O VI, and C III absorbers is determined. A direct comparison with the results of DSRS06 is given. In\naddition, the UV spectra are complemented by a galaxy\nsurvey of the field surrounding PKS1302\u2013102, made at\nLas Campanas Observatory. These observations are used\nto characterize the O VI absorbers and other metal-line\nsystems with respect to galaxies. This is the first in a\nseries of papers on the chemical enrichment of the lowredshift IGM (HST proposal 10679; PI: J. X. Prochaska).\nThe paper is organized as follows: the data and reduction procedures are discussed in \u00a7 2; the identification of\nabsorption-line systems in \u00a7 3; metal-line systems in \u00a7\n4; strong Ly\u03b1 absorbers in \u00a7 5; previous analysis in \u00a7 6;\ngalaxy survey and results in \u00a7 7; and final discussion and\n\nconclusions in \u00a7 8.\n2. DATA AND REDUCTION\n2.1. Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n\nPKS1302\u2013102 was observed for a total of 22 ks by the\nHubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST /STIS) in August 2001 (Program 8306;\nPI: M. Lemoine). The observations are summarized in\nTable 1. STIS observations were taken with the medium\nechelle grating E140M that covers 1140 . \u03bb . 1730 \u00c5.\nThe 44 orders were coadded individually before being\ncoadded into a one-dimensional spectrum, which was\nused for further analysis. There are gaps between the\norders for \u03bb & 1600 \u00c5. STIS E140M has a resolution of\nR \u2248 45, 000, or FWHM \u2248 7 km s\u22121 . More information\nabout STIS can be found in Mobasher (2002).\nThe data were retrieved from the Multimission Archive\nof Space Telescope (MAST)6 and were reduced with CalSTIS v2.15b with On-the-Fly-Reprocessing. The multiple exposures were coadded with the IDL routine COADSTIS from the XIDL library,7 which is described below.\nEach order of each exposure was rebinned to the same\nlogarithmic wavelength solution. Regions with bad data\nquality flags and a small neighboring buffer to the bad\nregions were excluded in the coadding of the observations. The STIS Data Handbook defines many data quality flags (Mobasher 2002), and all but three non-zero flags\nwere rejected (16, 32, and 1024). These three accepted\nflags indicated abnormally high dark rate and mild CCD\nblemishes.\nThe spectra were scaled to the spectrum with the\nhighest signal-to-noise ratio S/N, measured across all orders. The orders were coadded with the XIDL routine\nX COMBSPEC, which weights by S/N. To coadd the orders into one spectrum, overlapping regions of the orders\nwere combined by taking the weighted mean of the flux.\n2.2. Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer\nThe Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE )\ncomplements the STIS wavelength range and enables the\nidentification of important absorption lines at lower redshifts. FUSE covers 905 . \u03bb . 1190 \u00c5 with R \u2248 20, 000,\nor FWHM \u2248 15 km s\u22121 . In FUSE, Ly\u03b2 and O VI absorption can be detected at zabs . 0.15 and C III at\nzabs . 0.22. For PKS1302\u2013102, the H I column density\nis better constrained when Ly\u03b1 absorption from STIS is\nsupplemented with detections and upper limits of higherorder H I Lyman lines from FUSE. The O VI absorption\nthat may trace the WHIM should be more prevalent at\nlower redshifts, and it is important to search for O VI\nat zabs < 0.15. C III absorption is a common metal\nline from photoionized gas and, typically, indicates a\nmulti-phase medium when detected in a system with the\nhighly-ionized O VI (Prochaska et al. 2004).\nThe four gratings of FUSE disperse onto two detectors resulting in eight spectra per exposure. More details about the FUSE instrument and mission can be\nfound in Moos et al. (2000) and Sahnow et al. (2000).\nAll PKS1302\u2013102 FUSE observations were taken in photon address mode (i.e., time-tag mode) with the lowresolution aperture (LWRS).\n6\n7\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cxavier/IDL/\n\n\fIGM towards PKS1302\u2013102\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1\nOBSERVATIONS SUMMARY\nInstrument\n\nObs.

Sembach). The raw FUSE files, also downloaded from MAST, were completely reduced with a\nmodified CalFUSE8 v3.0.7 pipeline and coadded with\nDon Lindler's IDL tool FUSE REGISTER.\nThe two separate observations of PKS1302\u2013102 were\ncoadded into one set of eight spectra in order to increase\nS/N. The CalFUSE pipeline has procedures for this purpose. After each exposure has been processed, the intermediate data files (IDFs), which contain all information\nfrom the raw photon-event list to the wavelength solution, are combined into one IDF for each channel; in a\nsimilar manner, the bad pixel masks (BPMs) are also\ncombined. From these two files, the CalFUSE pipeline\nextracts the final, calibrated spectra.\nBy default, the combined IDF has its aperture centroid\ndefined by the first, single-exposure IDF in the list to be\ncombined. In addition, to save space, the combined BPM\nis only defined for the regions of the two-dimensional\nspectra used in the final extraction (i.e., aperture and\nbackground windows). Each single FUSE exposure of\nPKS1302\u2013102 has low S/N and a poorly measured centroid, and CalFUSE was not able to optimally extract\nthe final spectra. Even if they were optimally-extracted,\nthe spectra would exclude good data since the centroid\nused was not measured for the combined IDF.\nTo properly calculate the centroid for a combined IDF,\nseveral subroutines were copied from the CalFUSE program CF EDIT, which is an IDL GUI used to modify\nIDFs, into a customized IDL routine that calculates the\ncentroid and modifies the IDF header accordingly. This\nnew centroid was written to the headers of the individual IDFs so that the BPMs generated with the standard\nCalFUSE pipeline would automatically span the desired\nregions of the spectra. These BPMs were combined, as\nmentioned previously, and used with the combined IDFs\nto extract the calibrated spectra. In this manner, the\nPKS1302\u2013102 FUSE spectra were optimally extracted.\nThe calibrated spectra from each observation were\ncoadded with FUSE REGISTER. The eight segments\nwere not combined into one spectrum. This allowed\nfor the identification of the same feature in different\nsegments for confidence and avoids the issue that the\nFUSE channels have slightly different wavelength solutions. Values quoted in this paper primarily come from\nthe detection in the channel with the highest S/N.\nAccording to the FUSE white paper about wavelength\ncalibration,9 the two main sources of uncertainty in the\n8\n9\n\nftp://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/fuseftp/calfuse/\nhttp://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/calfuse wp1.html\n\nabsolute wavelength solution are the detector distortions\nand zero-point offsets, which, at worst, cause uncertainties of \u03b4v \u2248 13 km s\u22121 and \u2248 66 km s\u22121 , respectively. The\nSTIS wavelength solution is accurate to \u03b4v \u2248 4 km s\u22121\n(Mobasher 2002). The partial Lyman-limit system at\nzabs = 0.09487 spanned all the FUSE channels, save SiC\n1B (see \u00a7 4.5), and was used to shift the FUSE spectra\nonto the STIS wavelength solution. The alignment of the\nGalactic features is secondary evidence that the shifts are\nreasonable. For SiC 1B, the Galactic Ly\u03b3 emission was\nused. The spectra were shifted by the following amounts:\n\u221256 km s\u22121 (SiC 1B); 35 km s\u22121 (SiC 2A); 9 km s\u22121 (LiF\n2B); 21 km s\u22121 (LiF 1A); \u221222 km s\u22121 (SiC 1A); 18 km s\u22121\n(LiF 1B); and 2 km s\u22121 (LiF 2A).\nThe SiC 2B and LiF 2B segments were not used in the\nanalysis due to their poor sensitivity. The other three SiC\nchannels have poor flux zero points, resulting in negative\nflux and uncertain Wr ; however, line identification was\npossible. SiC 1A was excluded from analysis because LiF\n1A covered the same wavelength range; SiC 1B and 2A\nwere included to cover the lower wavelengths. There are\ntwo segments covering most wavelengths: 905 . \u03bb .\n1005 \u00c5 (SiC 2A and 1B); 990 . \u03bb . 1090 \u00c5 (LiF 1A);\nand 1088 . \u03bb . 1188 \u00c5 (LiF 1B and 2A).\n2.3. Continuum Fitting\nThe spectra were normalized with a parameterized bspline continuum-fitting program. Once an initial breakpoint spacing was chosen (\u2248 6 \u00c5 for STIS and \u2248 4\u20135 \u00c5 for\nFUSE ), the spectrum was iteratively fit with a b-spline.\nIn each iteration, pixels that lay outside the high/low\nsigma clips (e.g., 2.5/2) were masked out to prevent absorption features, cosmic rays, or other bad pixels from\nskewing the fit. This process was repeated until the fit\nchanged less than a set tolerance compared to the previous iteration. The breakpoint spacing was automatically decreased in regions of great change (e.g., quasar\nLy\u03b1 emission) and increased in regions of relatively little\nvariation. More specifically, the spacing is made coarser\nin regions where the binned flux fi varied by \u2264 10% compared to the error-weighted flux f \u0304; the spacing is refined\nwhere fi varied by greater than one standard deviation\n\u03c3fi of f \u0304. The value fi is the median flux in bins defined by the initial breakpoint spacing. The spectrum\nand its error were divided by the continuum to generate\nthe normalized spectrum used in the analysis.\nThe program may loosely be considered \"automatic:\"\nit will converge on the best fit for the spectrum based\non a given set of parameters. However, a fit based on\na random set of parameters may not be a good fit to\nthe continuum as judged visually by the authors. To\n\n\f4\n\nCooksey et al.\n\nestimate the errors resulting from the subjective nature\nof continuum fitting, we fit the spectra \"by-hand\" with\nthe XIDL routine X CONTINUUM and compared the\nchange in rest equivalent width Wr values. The Wr values measured from the spectra normalized by the automated program are in good agreement with those measured from the spectra normalized by hand. The rootmean-squared (RMS) fractional difference is < 5% for\nSTIS and 12% for FUSE. For column densities, the RMS\nfractional difference is < 1% for both instruments.\n3. ABSORPTION-LINE SYSTEMS\n3.1. Identifying Systems\n\nWe search for IGM absorption systems-absorption\nlines physically associated with one another\u2013with allowance for variations in e.g., ionizing mechanism, density, temperature. The absorption features detected in\nthe FUSE and STIS spectra were sorted into Galactic\nlines and intergalactic absorption lines. The latter category was further sorted into their respective systems by\ncomparing their redshifts, line profiles, and rest equivalent width Wr ratios. Lines of the same ionized species\nfrom a given absorption system should have the same\nredshift, similar line profiles, and unsaturated Wr values\nthat scale with oscillator strengths (see Figures 1 and\n2). Ions from the same phase of the IGM tend to have\nroughly the same redshift and similar profiles. For example, H I and C III of zabs = 0.04222 are well aligned\nin velocity space, and have similar asymmetric profiles,\nwhereas O VI is at a different redshift (velocity) and has\na dissimilar profile (see Figure 3); this suggests the H I\nand C III absorption arises from one phase of the IGM\nand O VI from another.\nIn order to thoroughly identify the absorption features\nin the spectra of PKS1302\u2013102, we developed an automated procedure to detect all features in the spectra\ngreater than a minimum significance and width. We then\ninteractively identified the features not coincident with\nGalactic lines.\n3.1.1. Automatic Line Detection and Doublet Search\n\nA purely interactive search (as described below) would\nbe biased towards systems with Ly\u03b1. O VI ions that are\nassociated with collisionally-ionized gas at T \u2248 3 \u00d7 105 K\n(e.g., the canonical WHIM) are likely to have associated Ly\u03b1 profiles that are broad and shallow (Richter\net al. 2004). The PKS1302\u2013102 spectra does not have\nsufficient S/N to reliably detect broad Ly\u03b1 features. To\navoid biasing the search against warm-hot O VI gas, we\nsearched for doublets independently of Ly\u03b1.\nIn order to conduct a blind search for pairs, primarily\ndoublets like O VI, an automated feature-finding program was developed to detect all possible absorption\nfeatures with a minimum significance \u03c3min and width.\nThe spectrum was first convolved with a Gaussian with\nFWHM bmin . The convolved pixels were grouped into\npotential features with significance \u03c3pix \u2265 \u03c3min . The\nprogram does not attempt to separate blended lines into\ncomponent features. The final result is a list of central\nwavelengths, observed equivalent width Wobs and error,\nand wavelength limits (used to measure Wobs ).\nNext, a blind search for doublets (O VI, C IV, N V, and\nSi IV) was performed. For example, the search assumed\n\neach automatically detected feature between Galactic\nand quasar O VI could be O VI 1031 and only identified\na possible pair when another feature was at the appropriate wavelength spacing within the bounds of \u03bb1031\ntranslated to the appropriate, redshifted wavelength of\n\u03bb1037. This procedure was repeated for the C IV, N V,\nand Si IV doublets and for Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b1, C III\npairs.\nThe blind doublet search successfully identified Galactic O VI, C IV, N V, and Si IV as well as the IGM\nO VI systems at zabs = 0.04222, 0.06471, 0.09487, and\n0.22555 verified by the interactive search. The weak O VI\nabsorbers at zabs = 0.19161 and 0.22752 are not 3\u03c3 features in both lines of the doublet and were not identified\nin the automated search when \u03c3min = 3. The search also\nresulted in a possible O VI doublet at zabs = 0.01583\nwith Ly\u03b1 not detected at 3\u03c3. However, this candidate\nO VI doublet is actually the coincidence of Galactic Ar I\n1048 and H2 1054.0 R(3). In this case, the misidentification was evident from the fact that the Wr ratio was\ninconsistent with an O VI doublet.\nIn general, the automated feature-finding program indicates features in a spectrum that have a roughly Gaussian profile and a measured significance greater than the\nminimum required. These features may or may not be\nabsorption lines. There is a balance between automatically detecting weak absorption lines and including spurious features. We calibrated the search parameters to\nmaximize the detection of lines with W\u03bb > 50 m\u00c5 while\nminimizing the inclusion of spurious features (less than\n10%).\n3.1.2. Interactive Search\n\nThe automatic line-detection procedure described\nabove generates a list of unidentified features meeting\na specified minimum set of requirements. The features\nmay be Galactic, intergalactic, or, in a few cases, spurious. The automated pair searches (e.g., Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2)\nsupply a starting point for interactively identifying the\nfeatures and sorting them into IGM absorption systems.\nThe potential feature list gives the lines that should be\nidentified and is used to determine the completeness of\nthe interactive search. The final, identified absorption\nlines are listed in Table 2.\nIdentifying the absorption lines first required disentangling Galactic from intergalactic features. The velocity\nplots of the Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2 pairs from the blind search were\nexamined individually. If these pairs were well aligned\nin velocity space, with similar line profiles, and decreasing Wr , we interactively searched for higher-order Lyman\nlines (e.g., Ly\u03b3, Ly\u03b4) and/or common metal lines, redshifted by the assumed-Ly\u03b1 redshift. These lines were\ngrouped as a possible system. The rough priority of\nmetal lines was: (a) C III, O VI, C IV \u03bb\u03bb1548, 1550;\n(b) N II \u03bb1083, Si III \u03bb1206, C II \u03bb1036 or \u03bb1334; and\n(c) N III \u03bb989, Si IV \u03bb\u03bb1393, 1402 (using atomic data\nlisted in Prochaska et al. 2004). In this initial search, no\nknowledge of the Galactic lines biased the identification\nof IGM absorption lines.\nSecond, all features from the automatic search corresponding to likely Galactic lines were recorded as such,\nregardless (for now) whether the same features were first\nidentified as IGM lines. The likely Galactic lines included\nvarious ionization states of iron, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur,\n\n\fIGM towards PKS1302\u2013102\n\n5\n\nTABLE 2\nWr SUMMARY\nIon\n\n\u03bbobs\n(\u00c5)\n\n\u03bbr\n(\u00c5)\n\nzabs\n\nW1\n(m\u00c5)\n\n\u03c3(W1 )\n(m\u00c5)\n\nW2\n(m\u00c5)\n\n\u03c3(W2 )\n(m\u00c5)\n\nWf\n(m\u00c5)\n\n\u03c3(Wf )\n(m\u00c5)\n\n47\n60\n68\n86\n74\n63\n81\n\n74\n247\n305\n350\n15\n156\n584\n\n37\n40\n38\n44\n44\n41\n37\n\n110\n262\n332\n353\n13\n111\n542\n\n29\n33\n33\n39\n38\n35\n34\n\nFUSE\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\n\nI 930\nI 937\nI 949\nI 972\nI 937\nIII 977\nI 949\n\n934.798\n941.898\n953.995\n976.903\n977.333\n981.309\n989.770\n\n930.748\n937.803\n949.743\n972.537\n937.803\n977.020\n949.743\n\n0.00435\n0.00437\n0.00448\n0.00449\n0.04215\n0.00439\n0.04214\n\n168\n293\n418\n367\n7\n7\n349\n\nNote. - Note that the list is incomplete for wavelengths < 1000\u00c5 where the data has poor\nS/N and significant line blending.

This\nset of lines was defined in a stacked spectrum of normalized STIS E140M spectra of 15 low-redshift quasars. In\nthe FUSE channels with \u03bb . 1000 \u00c5, molecular hydrogen lines are abundant due to the Lyman and Werner\nbands. The PKS1302\u2013102 sight line has moderate to\nlow molecular hydrogen absorption with a line of sight\nlog N (H2 ) = 16.3 (Wakker 2006).\nAll automatically detected features not already identified as Galactic or associated with an intergalactic system was assumed to be Ly\u03b1 if between Galactic Ly\u03b1\nand Ly\u03b1 at the redshift of PKS1302\u2013102 (i.e., 1216 .\n\u03bb . 1563 \u00c5). For example, the strong Ly\u03b1 absorber at\nzabs = 0.19243 was detected automatically, not paired\nwith Ly\u03b2, and not corresponding to a Galactic line.\nFor spectra of low-redshift quasars, line confusion (e.g.,\nblends) is minimal. However, line coincidences do occur. As an example, consider the Lyman series at\nzabs = 0.09400, which first appeared to be an especially\nstrong H I absorber. The Ly\u03b2, Ly\u03b3, and Ly\u03b4 transitions\nwere blended with Galactic lines, and higher-order Lyman lines were confused with H2 absorption and with the\nhigher-order Lyman lines at zabs = 0.09487. Occasional\nblends also occur between different IGM absorption systems. We disentangle these blends assuming common\nline-strengths for the various transitions within a blend,\nallowing for modest variations. For instance, DSRS06\nlists a Ly\u03b1 absorber at zabs = 0.08655, whereas we identify it as Si III at zabs = 0.09487 because the would-be\nLy\u03b2 at zabs = 0.08655 was less than 3\u03c3 significance and\nthe system at zabs = 0.09487 is a strong H I absorber\nexpected to have associated metal-line absorption.\nThroughout this paper, only the statistical errors from\nphoton counting are quoted, but the true errors should\naccount for the combined statistical, continuum, and systematic errors. An estimate of the combined error will\nchange the detection limit with respect to the statistical\nerror. In \u00a7 2.3, we estimated the RMS fractional difference due to continuum fitting to be < 5% for STIS\nand 12% for FUSE. The rest equivalent width is measured with a simple boxcar summation. The wavelength\nlimits of the boxcar window were defined interactively\nand are subjective. The RMS fractional difference due\nto changing the window by 15% is 6% for STIS and 13%\nfor FUSE. Column densities were affected by less than\n\n1% by changing the window.\nThe errors from the continuum fitting and boxcar summation are correlated, but as a first approximation, we\nwill add them in quadrature. Ultimately, for a feature\nto be detected at three times the combined error, the\nfeature must be detected at 3.1\u03c3 for STIS and 3.6\u03c3 for\nFUSE, where \u03c3 is the statistical error only. For example,\nC III at zabs = 0.00438 is a 3.2\u03c3 detection, but folding in\nthe 12% continuum-fitting and 13% boxcar-summation\nerrors for FUSE, the feature is 2.8 times the combined\nerror. Ly\u03b2 at zabs = 0.12565 is a similar case in the STIS\nspectrum. The majority of lines discussed in this paper\nhave significance greater than three times the combined\nerror, and we will use 3\u03c3, commonly quoted in the literature, as our detection limit knowing a more rigorous\nexamination of our errors does not affect our results.\nThere are 28 Ly\u03b1 features detected at \u2265 3\u03c3 significance\nin the spectra of PKS1302\u2013102. Of these, 15 are strong\nLy\u03b1 absorbers with log NHI \u2265 14 (54%) and eight with\nat least one metal line (29%). A ninth tentative metalline system has log NHI = 13.1. There are five probable\nO VI systems. Line identification is complete to 90%\nin the region of STIS where intergalactic Ly\u03b1 could be\ndetected with \u03c3min = 4\u03c3 and bmin = 20 km s\u22121 ,10 and\nidentification is complete to > 85% in FUSE LiF 2A, 1B,\nand 1A for bmin = 40 km s\u22121 features. Completeness was\nmeasured by correlating the identified lines from the interactive search with the automatically detected features\ndiscussed above.\n3.2. Column Densities, Doppler Parameters, and\n\nMetallicities\nFor absorption systems exhibiting at least two members of the H I Lyman series, the H I column density\nlog NHI and Doppler parameter b were measured with a\ncurve-of-growth (COG) analysis of the Wr values that\nminimized \u03c72 . For metal lines, the apparent optical\ndepth method (AODM) was used to measure the column\ndensities (Savage & Sembach 1991).\nHowever, as discussed in Fox et al. (2005), the AODMmeasured column densities from low-S/N spectra systematically overestimate the true column densities due to\n10 The remaining 10% of the automatically identified features\nthat could be Ly\u03b1 appear to be spurious.\n\n\f6\n\nCooksey et al.\n\nspurious high-AOD (low flux) pixels and the exponential\nnature of the AODM. From Monte Carlo tests, we measure this to be, at worst, a 0.2 and 0.25 dex effect for\nunsaturated features in STIS and FUSE, respectively.\nTo measure metallicities, we used ionization corrections from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) or\nphotoionization models of the metal-line systems, calculated with CLOUDY11 versions 94 and 06.02.09a, respectively, as last described by Ferland et al. (1998). The\nCIE models are described in Prochaska et al. (2004).\nTo construct the photoionization models, the medium\nwas assumed to be a plane-parallel slab ionized by a\nHaardt & Madau (1996, updated in 2005) quasar-only\nultraviolet background. The number density of hydrogen nH was assumed to be 0.1 cm\u22123 , though our models are insensitive to this parameter in the opticallythin regime. The ionization parameter log U , metallicity\n[M/H],12 neutral column density log NHI , and redshift of\nthe UV background were varied to sample the parameter\nspace. The ionization parameter is a dimensionless ratio\nof the number of hydrogen-ionizing photons to the total\nnumber of hydrogen atoms.\nAbundance-independent ionic ratios of the same metal\n(e.g., N(C++ )/N(C+3 )) and/or abundance-dependent\nratios of metals with similar ionization potentials (e.g.,\nN(C+3 )/N(O+5 )) constrained log U or T (see \u00a7 4.5). The\nlog U or T limits define the ionization corrections for the\nmeasured metallicities (e.g., [C/H]). Due to the simplifications and assumptions in the CLOUDY models, the\nmodel abundances and metallicities are reliable to within\na factor of two.\nModeling of a multi-phase medium was generally not\nconsidered because the systems presented in this paper\nsimply have too few metal lines. By the same token,\nmulti-phase and collisional ionization non-equilibrium\nscenarios are not ruled out by the observations. In select cases where the kinematics and abundances suggest\na multi-phase medium, we do use photoionization and\nCIE models to describe the different components.\n4. METAL-LINE SYSTEMS\n\nThis section summarizes the nine Ly\u03b1 systems with\nat least one metal line detected. Velocity plots, COG\nanalysis, and CLOUDY models for each system are discussed. Four of the nine systems have C III absorption\nonly, one with C III and the O VI doublet, three with\ntentative O VI detections, and one with C III, Si III, and\na broad O VI doublet. Because C III is the dominant line\nin photoionized gas, it may be more readily detected in\nthe moderate-S/N PKS1302\u2013102 spectra. The metal-line\nsystems are summarized in Table 3.\nAll but three of the metal-line systems have log NHI\n\u2265 15. The two systems with multiple metal lines are\nlikely multi-phase based on kinematic arguments (e.g.,\nvelocity offsets, line profiles) and the poor fit of singlephase models to the data.

The Voigt profile centroid is fixed\nat the redshift of Ly\u03b2 z\u03b2 = 0.00439. Ly\u03b1 is detected in the wings\nof the damped Galactic Ly\u03b1 feature, and the lines higher than\nLy\u03b2 are detected in the SiC 2A and 1B channels, which have poor\nsensitivity. C II and C IV 1550 are not detected at 3\u03c3. Ly\u03b3, Ly\u03b4,\nand Ly\u01eb are blended with Galactic C III, H2 954.0 R(4), and H2\n941.6 P(2), respectively. As shown, Galactic C II 1036 is coincident\nwhere O VI 1031 would be, and there is an absence of O VI 1037.\n\nmodels with [M/H] consistent with the final, derived\nmetallicity. In cases where the log U value is not well\nconstrained by the observations, we adopt a central\nvalue based on log NHI , as predicted by the empirical/theoretical relation in Prochaska et al. (2004). The\nnature of the galaxy environment of these systems will\nbe discussed in \u00a7 7.\n4.1. zabs = 0.00442: C III\nThis metal-line system was detected at v \u2248\n1300 km s\u22121 , in the wings of the damped Galactic Ly\u03b1\nprofile (see Figure 1). The PKS1302\u2013102 sight-line also\npasses through the Virgo cluster at this redshift (Wakker\net al. 2003). Ly\u03b1 and C III are well aligned in velocity\nspace with similar line profiles, which imply the two absorbers are kinematically similar. Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and Ly\u03b6\nwere used to fit the COG: log NHI = 15.8+0.4\n\u22120.2 and b\n\u22121\n+1.5\n= 17\u22121.7 km s (see Figure 2).\nThe H I column density is not well constrained for this\nsystem. Ly\u03b2, which was detected in LiF 1A, has the\nhighest detection significance of the Lyman series. The\nhigher-order lines fall in the SiC 2A and 1B channels,\nwhich have poor sensitivity. The AODM HI column density for the saturated Ly\u03b2 line sets a lower limit of log NHI\n\n\u22124.0\n\u22127.5\n\n\u22127.0\n\n\u22126.5\nlog(f\u03bb)\n\n\u22126.0\n\n\u22125.5\n\nFig. 2.- H I COG for zabs = 0.00438.

DSRS06 measured log NHI = 14.872 \u00b1 0.286 and\nb = 18 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 from a Voigt profile fit to Ly\u03b1. We\nexamined the velocity plot with Voigt profile outlines for\n[log NHI ,b] = [15.8,17.4] and [14.87,18]. The DSRS06 values clearly underestimate the Ly\u03b2 absorption.\nThe ionic ratios N(C+ )/N(C++ ) and N(C++ )/N(C+3 )\nconstrained the ionization parameter to \u22123.4 \u2264 log U \u2264\n\u22122.1 for the CLOUDY models with log NHI = 15.75. For\nlog U = \u22122.1, \u22122 \u2264 [C/H] \u2264 \u22120.9. From the kinematics\nof Ly\u03b1 and C III and CLOUDY modeling, the zabs =\n0.00438 system is well described as a photoionized, metalpoor, single-phase medium.\n4.2. zabs = 0.04226: O VI, C III\nThe Ly\u03b1 profile shows two strong components. The\nblueward component aligns well with C III and the redward with O VI (see Figure 3). The H I COG for\nthis absorber included Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and Ly\u03b3, and the values are well constrained: log NHI = 15.07+0.08\n\u22120.07 and b\n\u22121\n= 22+1.9\nkm\ns\n(see\nFigure\n4).\nLy\u01eb,\nO\nI\n\u03bb1302,\nC II,\n\u22121.8\nand C IV 1550 were not detected at 3\u03c3. Ly\u03b4 is blended\nwith Galactic N III, Ly\u03b3 with H2 1013.4 R(1), and Ly\u03b2\nwith C III at zabs = 0.09400. O VI 1037 is blended with\nthe weak H2 1081.7 R(3) line.\nThe H I Lyman lines and C III have similar line profiles\nand appear well aligned in velocity space, while O VI is\nshifted redward. Since Ly\u03b1 is saturated and multicomponent, its velocity is not well constrained. Taking Ly\u03b3 as\nthe reference line for the stronger H I component, O VI\n1031 has \u03b4vabs \u2261 c(zabs \u2212 z\u03b3 )/(1 + z\u03b3 ) = +54 km s\u22121 ,\nwhile C III is perfectly aligned. The significant velocity\noffset between the metal-line profiles suggests the metals\nreside in different phases of gas, with overlapping Ly\u03b1 absorption. The O VI absorption appears associated with\nmore tenuous narrow Ly\u03b1 absorption, and the doublet\nhas a width similar to the redward Ly\u03b1 component.\nThe Wr ratio of O VI 1031 to 1037 (1.1 \u00b1 0.14) does\nnot agree with the expected 2 : 1 ratio.

The Ly\u03b1 profile shows two components on either side\nof v = 0 km s\u22121 . C III is more aligned with the stronger, blueward component of Ly\u03b1, while O VI is more aligned with the\nweaker, redward component. The Voigt profiles are based on a\nsingle-component COG model (see Figure 4) with centroid fixed at\nz\u03b3 = 0.04224. O VI 1037 is blended with H2 1081.7 R(3) and is\nflanked by H2 1081.2 P(2) to the blue and Galactic F II 1081 to\nthe red. Ly\u03b2, Ly\u03b3, and Ly\u03b4 are blended (see \u00a7 4.2). Ly\u01eb, O I, C II,\nand C IV 1550 are not detected at 3\u03c3.

At the central value of\nlog U = \u22122.6, one would require [O/C] \u2248 +3 and a\nsuper-solar O abundance to explain the column densities\nof C++ and O+5 . The abundance-dependent ionic ratio\nN(C+3 )/N(O+5 ) sets log U > [C/O] \u2212 1.1 and requires\n[C/O] < \u22120.5 for the oxygen and carbon absorption to\nbe from the same photoionized phase. In this case, log U\n= \u22121.9, [C/H] = \u22121.1, and [O/H] = +0.3 (see Table 4).\nSince [O/H] = +0.3 is not likely, we consider a singlephase photoionized model to be ruled out, as supported\nby the kinematics. However, the oxygen absorption could\narise in a photoionized phase with log U = \u22121.1, assuming [C/O] = 0, and then [O/H] = \u22121.2.\nWe have considered collisional ionization models. Under the assumption of CIE, the carbon absorption is constrained to be in a warm phase 5.3 \u00d7 104 < T < 9.8 \u00d7\n104 K. Considering the limit set by N(C+3 )/N(O+5 ), the\noxygen would be from a warm-hot phase T > 2.4 \u00d7 105 K\nwith low metallicity [O/H] > \u22122. For this value, we have\nassumed the H I column density in the warm-hot phase is\nthe same as measured in the COG analysis for the warm\nphase.\nIn summary, we favor a two-phase photoionization\nmodel for this system, as strongly supported by the kinematics. The strong, blueward H I component and the\nnarrower, redward Ly\u03b1 component have strong, wellaligned C III and O VI absorption, respectively.\nzabs = 0.06468: O VI\nThough a tentative detection, O VI is well aligned with\nLy\u03b1 (see Figure 5). The Wr ratio of O VI 1031 to 1037\nis 1.1 \u00b1 0.4, and log N(O+5 ) = 13.8 (see Table 3). At\nthe redshift of Ly\u03b1, there is no C III detected. However,\nthere are two features in the vicinity: zabs = 0.09487 Ly\u03b4\nat \u03b4vabs > 100 km s\u22121 and H2 1040.4 P(2) at \u03b4vabs \u2248\n0 km s\u22121 , with respect to the centroid of the unsaturated\nLy\u03b2. The H2 P(2) profile may be blended, and we treat\nthe whole feature as an upper limit for C III at zabs =\n0.06471: log N(C++ ) < 13.1. O I and C IV 1550 are not\ndetected at 3\u03c3.\nThe zabs = 0.06471 system is one of two tentative\nmetal-line systems with log NHI < 15.

Ly\u03b3 is blended with a weak Galactic\nline. Therefore, we conservatively consider the best fit to be an\nupper limit.\n\nIn the CLOUDY models with log NHI = 15, the ionic\nratios N(C+ )/N(C++ ) and N(C++ )/N(C+3 ) constrain\nthe ionization parameter: \u22123.6 \u2264 log U \u2264 \u22121.5.

This system is well\nmodeled by a single-phase, photoionized medium.\n4.5. zabs = 0.09487: Partial Lyman Limit System\nThis system shows strong H I Lyman absorption from\nLy\u03b1 to H I 914a (see Figure 9). Ly\u01eb is in the wings of\nGalactic Ly\u03b2 absorption, and the higher-order Lyman\nlines H I 926 up to H I 914a fall in a region riddled with\nH2 lines. Though the Lyman break \u03bb912 is in a region\nof LiF 1A with low sensitivity, log NHI can be measured\nfrom the flux decrement at the limit. The optical depth\n\u03c4912 = ln(fQSO /f912 ) = \u03c3912 NHI , where fQSO (f912 ) is\nthe flux redward (blueward) of the break and the cross\nsection at the limit \u03c3912 = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm\u22122 (see Figure\n10). We measure log NHI = 17.2 \u00b1 0.2, consistent with\nthe COG value discussed below.\nThe majority of the Lyman series from Ly\u03b1 to H I 914a\nwere used in the H I COG analysis: log NHI = 16.88+0.03\n\u22120.03\n\u22121\nand b = 30.3+0.4\n(see Figure 11). A single\u22120.4 km s\ncomponent COG fits the data well, though this system\nhas multiple components, as seen in the Ly\u03b1, C III, Si II,\nand Si III line profiles.\nC III and Si III are well-aligned with Ly\u03b1. This system is the strongest C III absorber in the PKS1302\u2013102\nsight line log N(C++ ) > 13.9. A broad, well-aligned O VI\ndoublet is detected with an Wr ratio of 2.3 \u00b1 0.8 and\nlog N(O+5 ) = 14. Si II \u03bb1260, O I, and the Si IV and\nC IV doublets are not detected at 3\u03c3.\nFor the CLOUDY models with log NHI = 17, the ionic\nratios N(C+ )/N(C++ ) and N(Si++ )/N(Si+3 ) set \u22123.3 \u2264\nlog U \u2264 \u22122.6 (see Figure 12). For log U = \u22122.9, we\nderive \u22122 < [C/H] < \u22121.6 and [Si/H] = \u22121.7 (see Table 6). O VI is very broad, and this indicates at least\na kinematically different phase from the C III and Si III\nabsorption. Likely, O VI is thermally broadened, and we\nshould consider the CLOUDY CIE models.

The broad O VI indicates another phase that\nis likely collisionally ionized but is also reasonably described by a photoionization model.\nzabs = 0.14529: C III\nAlthough Ly\u03b1 is as broad as that of the partial Lyman limit system discussed previously, the system at\nzabs = 0.14533 has a significantly lower NHI value (see\nFigure 14). Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and Ly\u03b3 were used to fit the H I\n\u22121\n+1.3\nCOG: log NHI = 15.39+0.03\n(see\n\u22120.03 and b = 54\u22121.2 km s\nFigure 15). Ly\u03b4 was excluded because it lies near the\nedge of LiF 2A; it deviates from the value predicted by\nthe COG by > 3\u03c3. This discrepancy may also indicate\nthat the system is multicomponent and poorly modeled\nby a single-component COG.\nC III is well aligned with the broad Ly\u03b1, and\nlog N(C++ ) = 13.2 (see Table 3). A detection of the O VI\ndoublet is not confirmed because O VI 1037 is at the edge\nof LiF 1B and in the low-sensitivity region of STIS. The\nequivalent width of O VI 1037 is greater than that of 1031\nbecause 1037 is coincident with Ly\u03b2 at zabs = 0.15835.\nAn upper limit is given by O VI 1031: log N(O+5 ) < 14.2.\nO I and C II are not detected at 3\u03c3 significance.\nIn the CLOUDY model with log NHI = 15.5, the ionic\nratios N(C+ )/N(C++ ) and N(C++ )/N(O+5 ) set \u22123.7 \u2264\nlog U \u2264 [C/O] \u2212 1.3. Assuming log U = \u22121.9, the value\npredicted by Prochaska et al. (2004), [C/H] = \u22121.9 and\n[O/H] < \u22120.4 for [C/O] = 0. In the CLOUDY CIE\nmodel, the same ratios set 4.1 \u00d7 104 \u2264 T \u2264 1.9 \u00d7 105 K.\nAssuming the width of H I is due purely to thermal\nbroadening, then T = b2 m/(2k) < 1.8 \u00d7 105 K, where\nm is the mass of hydrogen and k is the Boltzmann constant.

STRONG Ly\u03b1 ABSORBERS WITHOUT METALS\n\n4.9. zabs = 0.22752: O VI\nThe weak Ly\u03b1 absorber at zabs = 0.22752 may potentially have O VI absorption associated with it. Ly\u03b1\nand O VI 1031 are detected at > 3\u03c3. From the AODM,\nlog NHI = 13.1\u00b10.1 and log N(O+5 ) = 13.56\u00b10.09. O VI\n1031 is likely blended with Ly\u03b1 at zabs = 0.04222. No\nother common absorption line is evident or observable:\nC II 1036 is coincident with O VI at zabs = 0.22555 and\nLy\u03b1 at zabs = 0.04658; C III is coincident with Galactic N I; and C IV is shifted out of the STIS wavelength\ncoverage. No CLOUDY models were examined for this\nsystem.\n\nIn addition to the nine metal-line systems described\nabove, we identified 15 Ly\u03b1 features detected at > 3\u03c3\nsignificance (see Table 7). There are seven Ly\u03b1 lines\nwith log NHI \u2265 14 that we identify as strong. Given\nthe absence of metal-line absorption, the identification\nof these lines as Ly\u03b1 should be considered less secure.\nHowever all of the strong Ly\u03b1 lines show corresponding\nLy\u03b2 absorption at > 3\u03c3 significance, which lends credibility to our identification. In Table 7, we quote either\nthe AODM column density or log NHI and b from the\nCOG analysis when there is at least one other Lyman\nline detected. The log NHI values from the AODM are\nlower limits when Ly\u03b1 is saturated.\nThe Ly\u03b1 absorbers at zabs = 0.19243 and 0.19296\n\n\f14\n\nCooksey et al.\nTABLE 7\nLy\u03b1 ABSORBERS SUMMARY\nba\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nlog NHI \u2265 14.0b\n1272.299\n1335.915\n1421.538\n1449.602\n1488.674\n1518.071\n1522.250\n\n0.04658\n0.09891\n0.16935\n0.19243\n0.22457\n0.24875\n0.25219\n\n228 \u00b1 12\n362 \u00b1 7\n212 \u00b1 13\n222 \u00b1 8\n298 \u00b1 13\n263 \u00b1 14\n447 \u00b1 12\n\n+0.13\n14.00\u22120.16\n+0.04 c\n14.22\u22120.05\n+0.18 c\n14.04\u22120.28\n+0.17 c\n14.02\u22120.27\n+0.09\n13.95\u22120.11\n14.10+0.06\n\u22120.06\n+0.06\n14.74\u22120.06\n\n+9.1\n23\u22123.5\n35+2.6\n\u22122.0\n+17.0\n20\u22123.2\n+22.2\n21\u22123.3\n+32.0\n42\u22129.0\n+3.3\n25\u22122.7\n+1.5\n32\u22121.5\n\nlog NHI < 14.0b\n1269.721\n1287.019\n1288.219\n1365.581\n1368.425\n1408.170\n1450.246\n1503.392\n1507.475\n1520.922\n1523.069\n1524.594\n\n0.04446\n0.05869\n0.05968\n0.12332\n0.12565\n0.15835\n0.19296\n0.23668\n0.24004\n0.25110\n0.25286\n0.25412\n\n149 \u00b1 9\n86 \u00b1 9\n71 \u00b1 7\n135 \u00b1 13\n66 \u00b1 10\n71 \u00b1 11\n220 \u00b1 8\n59 \u00b1 11\n81 \u00b1 9\n201 \u00b1 16\n280 \u00b1 11\n227 \u00b1 16\n\n13.56 \u00b1 0.03\n13.35 \u00b1 0.05\n13.21 \u00b1 0.06\n13.51 \u00b1 0.04\n13.17 \u00b1 0.07\n13.18 \u00b1 0.07\n13.82+0.12\n\u22120.15\n13.15 \u00b1 0.09\n13.28 \u00b1 0.06\n13.67 \u00b1 0.04\n13.89+0.10\n\u22120.12\n13.84 \u00b1 0.03\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n+49.1\n31\u22127.6\n***\n***\n***\n+78.8\n45\u221212.4\n***\n\na Where b not given, log N\nHI from the AODM and is typically a lower limit.

As mentioned previously, metalline absorption roughly scales with log NHI ; the zabs =\n0.25219 system should show some metal-line absorption\nsince the other three systems do. These systems appear\nto be at the edge of our ability to detect metal-line absorbers.\n6. COMPARISONS WITH PREVIOUS ANALYSES\n\nThe STIS dataset (PI: M. Lemoine) was acquired to\nmeasure an intergalactic D/H value from the z = 0.095\npartial Lyman limit system. Unexpected line-blending\nhas apparently precluded such an analysis (Lemoine,\npriv. comm.) and the data was not studied for this\npurpose. PKS1302\u2013102 was included, however, in the\ncompilation of Danforth et al. (2006) who studied Ly\u03b1,\nLy\u03b2, O VI, and C III lines along 31 AGN sightlines at\nz < 0.3. We have compared our results against DSRS06\nto search for systematic effects related to different procedures of data reduction and analysis. In particular, we\nhave derived equivalent widths differently than DSRS06;\nour analysis adopts values from a simple boxcar summation whereas DSRS06 implemented line-profile fits using\nthe VPFIT software package.\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nWr (m\u00c5)\n\n400\n\n500\n\nFig. 20.- Comparison of rest equivalent widths from our analysis\nwith Danforth et al.

The (blue) circles are for Ly\u03b1 Wr ,\nand the (red) triangles are for metal lines (i.e., C III and O VI).\nDSRS06 use COG concordance plots, Voigt profile fits, and/or the\nAODM to measure log NDSRS06 and bDSRS06 , typically assuming a\nsingle component. From log NDSRS06 and bDSRS06 , they measure\nWr,DSRS06 .

We generally agree with log NDSRS06\nbecause the sum of potential components does not greatly affect\nthe total column density (top panel). On the other hand, unresolved components tend to increase bDSRS06 compared our values,\nas discussed in DSRS06 (bottom panel).\n\n\fIGM towards PKS1302\u2013102\nFigure 20 presents a comparison of the rest equivalent\nwidth (Wr ) measurements of DSRS06 against our values\nfor Ly\u03b1 and metal-line transitions. We find that the two\nsets of measurements are in good agreement for Wr values of metal-line transitions. Similarly, there is relatively\ngood agreement between the two studies for Ly\u03b1 lines at\nlow rest equivalent widths (Wr < 300 m\u00c5). The only\nnotable difference is that the DSRS06 rest equivalent\nwidth errors \u03c3(Wr ) for the Ly\u03b1 lines are systematically\nlower than our values; DSRS06 report \u03c3(Wr ) \u2264 5 m\u00c5\nfor the majority of their lines. While line-profile fitting\ntechniques can recover more precise measurements of the\nequivalent width than a boxcar summation, we contend\nthat a 5 m\u00c5 error cannot be achieved from this dataset\n(S/N \u2248 3 to 6 per pixel). Even for strong lines where\none might be justified in assuming the core has zero flux\nwith zero uncertainty, the wings of the line-profile have\nequivalent width errors of greater than 10 m\u00c5. We can\nonly speculate on the implications of adopting very small\nerrors on Wr for Ly\u03b1 transitions. DSRS06 performed\nconcordance COG analysis of NHI and b values in a similar manner as the analysis presented here. Because the\nLy\u03b1 line has the largest Wr value in the Lyman series,\nadopting a very small uncertainty will drive the COG\nanalysis to best model the Ly\u03b1 transition. In particular,\nthis will imply bCOG = bLy\u03b1 which DSRS06 emphasize\ngenerally overestimates the true Doppler parameter of\nthe 'cloud' dominating the optical depth. We will return\nto this point below.\nThere are more serious discrepancies between our results and DSRS06 for stronger Ly\u03b1 lines (Wr > 300 m\u00c5).\nFirst, we identify five Ly\u03b1 lines with log NHI > 13.8 that\nDSRS06 have not, at zabs = 0.16935, 0.19243, 0.19296,\n0.25286, and 0.25412. The zabs = 0.16935 Ly\u03b1 is a\nmulti-component system with Ly\u03b2 lost in Galactic N I,\nand zabs = 0.19243 Ly\u03b1 has a similar problem. The\nzabs = 0.19296 and 0.25286 Ly\u03b1 have Ly\u03b2 detected at\n> 3\u03c3. These features are not Galactic lines nor misidentified metal lines from other intervening systems. Although DSRS06 detect other strong Ly\u03b1 lines without\nLy\u03b2 absorption, these lines were not reported in their\nsurvey. Second, we have derived systematically larger\nWr values for strong Ly\u03b1 lines. Most notable are the\nfive Ly\u03b1 lines in Figure 20 that deviate by more than 3\u03c3\nfrom the Wr values reported by DSRS06. The majority of the discrepancy is probably due to these features\nbeing multi-component; we quote the total Wr of the feature whereas DSRS06 generally only report the strongest\nsingle component. We find similar differences when comparing the DSRS06 results for PKS0405\u2013123 against the\nresults reported in Prochaska et al. (2004).\nWe also compare the column densities and Doppler parameter values for absorption lines analyzed by DSRS06\n(see Figure 21). The metal-line column densities are\nconsidered first. In contrast to the equivalent width\nmeasurements for these transitions, we find that our\nvalues are systematically larger than those reported by\nDSRS06. Most worrisome is that we report several lower\nlimits to the column density of C III because the line\nis clearly saturated in the FUSE observations whereas\nDSRS06 report not a single lower limit. For example,\nwe report log N(C++ ) > 13.9 for the C III transition\nin the z = 0.09487 absorber whereas DSRS06 report\n\n15\n\nlog N(C++ ) = 13.73 \u00b1 0.05. The differences in O VI column densities are < 0.3 dex, and probably due to continuum placement. The broad, shallow O VI detection\nat zabs = 0.09487 differs by 0.3 dex whereas the stronger\nzabs = 0.04222 feature differs only by 0.1 dex.\nRegarding the H I column densities, we note trends\nsimilar to those for the Wr values: at low column densities there is good agreement between the two analyses, but at larger NHI our values are systematically\nlarger. The difference is most acute for the two systems\nat log NHI > 15.5: zabs = 0.00438 and 0.09487. As mentioned in \u00a7 4.1, DSRS06 use a profile fit to zabs = 0.00438\nLy\u03b1, which falls in the Galactic damped Ly\u03b1 profile, to\ndetermine NHI . Our COG analysis includes Ly\u03b2, which\nis the only feature of the system in a good region of\nthe spectra. The difference for zabs = 0.09487 is due\nto DSRS06 only including Ly\u03b1 through H I 926 in their\nconcordance COG analysis. For this system, the higherorder H I Lyman lines are most important for measuring\nthe NHI value.\nFinally, we have compared the Doppler parameter values from the two analyses (Figure 21; lower panel). At\nlow b values, we find reasonable agreement, but at moderate values our results are systematically lower than the\nvalues reported by DSRS06. We suspect the discrepancy is related to the very small errors adopted for their\nLy\u03b1 equivalent widths (Figure 20). In this case, a COG\nanalysis will yield a Doppler parameter which better describes Ly\u03b1 and, as DSRS06 emphasize, bLy\u03b1 is systematically larger than bCOG . Because DSRS06 generally\nadopt equivalent values from the literature (e.g. Penton\net al. 2004), it is possible that this systematic effect is\nonly present in the few sightlines analyzed by DSRS06\n(e.g., PKS1302\u2013102, PKS0405\u2013123). We also note that\nthe larger b values likely lead to a systematic underestimate of NHI which explains at least part of the offset of\ntheir values from our results for log NHI > 14.\nTripp et al. (2007) searched for H I and O VI absorption in archival STIS spectra of 16 low-redshift quasars.\nThey fit Voigt profiles and applied the AODM to measure\nequivalent widths and column densities of absorption\nlines, including individual components. For PKS1302\u2013\n102, they report three O VI systems at zabs,T 07 =\n0.19159, 0.22563, and 0.22744 that correspond to the\nsystems at zabs = 0.19161, 0.22555, and 0.22752, respectively, from \u00a7 4. We briefly summarize the Tripp\net al. (2007) results for the PKS1302\u2013102 sightline. The\nH I system at zabs,T 07 = 0.19159 has a strong, narrow component coincident with a tentative weak, shallow\ncomponent. C III, Si III, and only O VI 1031 are detected at > 3\u03c3 and well-aligned with the H I lines. The\nzabs,T 07 = 0.22563 H I absorption is single component\nbut is offset (\u03b4vabs = \u221218 km s\u22121 ) from the O VI doublet, which is detected at > 3\u03c3 in both lines. Weak Ly\u03b1\n(log NHI = 13) and the O VI doublet, also detected at\n> 3\u03c3 in both lines, are well-aligned at zabs,T 07 = 0.22744.\nWe differ from Tripp et al. (2007) most with respect to\nthe measured integrated equivalent widths. The discrepancy is strongest for the O VI doublet measurements,\nbut the difference are typically less than 2\u03c3. The quoted\nDoppler parameters (for H I) and column densities (H I,\nO VI doublet) are in excellent agreement.\nIn conclusion, we qualitatively agree with one main re-\n\n\f16\n\nCooksey et al.\n\n8\n\nN\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\nzgal\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\nFig. 22.- Histogram of 64 galaxies with zgal \u2264 0.3 in PKS1302\u2013\n102 field, binned to 1000 km s\u22121 (open).

The\nexception is for a line at \u03bbobs \u2248 1321 \u00c5 that DSRS06\nidentify as Ly\u03b1 at zabs = 0.0865 and we list as Si III\n1206 at zabs = 0.09487. Discrepancies in measured quantities are due to differences in reduction (e.g., spectra extraction, continuum fitting) and analysis (e.g., measuring\nWr , accommodating blending), which greatly affect error\nestimates.\n7. GALAXY SURVEY\n\nA number of studies have examined the relationship\nbetween galaxies and absorption-line systems at z . 0.1.\nRegarding metal-line systems, the majority of recent\nanalyses can be characterized as a detailed study of a single or few absorbers (e.g. Stocke et al. 2004; Jenkins et al.\n2005; Tripp et al. 2006a), an analysis of a complete sightline and its surrounding galaxies (Sembach et al. 2004b;\nProchaska et al. 2006), or a survey comprising multiple\nfields and absorbers (Stocke et al. 2006). These studies\nhave examined metal-line systems associated with a diverse set of ions (Si+ , C+ , O0 , O+5 ), metallicities, and\nH I column densities. Furthermore, the galaxy surveys\nhave a wide range of magnitude limits and field-of-view\nareas. Not surprisingly, a range of conclusions have been\ndrawn regarding the association of galaxies and absorbers\nincluding: (i) a physical association of the gas with individual galactic halos (Chen & Prochaska 2000), (ii) outflows from dwarf galaxies (Stocke et al. 2004), and largescale (e.g. filamentary) structures (Stocke et al. 2006;\nTripp et al. 2006a). Indeed, all of these may contribute\nto metal-line systems, presumably with a dependence on\nthe metallicity, ionization state, and column density of\nthe gas. Other analyses begin with a well-defined galaxy\nsurvey and search for absorption associated with galaxies at small impact parameters to the sightline (Lanzetta\net al. 1995; Chen et al. 2001a,b). These authors con-\n\nclude that the presence of a galaxy within \u2248 200 kpc of a\nquasar sightline results in a high probability of showing\ncoincident Ly\u03b1 and C IV absorption.\nOur analysis of PKS1302\u2013102 has identified nine metalline systems showing a diverse set of characteristics, and\nwe might expect, therefore, them to arise in a range of\ngalactic environments. We have obtained spectra of objects in the field surrounding PKS1302\u2013102 using the\nWFCCD camera on the 100\u2032\u2032 Dupont telescope at Las\nCampanas Observatory during UT 2001-04-16 to 200104-20 (see Table 8). We refer the reader to Prochaska\net al. (2006) for details of the imaging and spectral data\nreduction and analysis procedures. The survey of the\nPKS1302\u2013102 field is 95% complete within 5\u2032 and 70%\nwithin 10\u2032 to the limiting magnitude R \u2248 19.5. We have\nredshift information for 82 galaxies in the PKS1302\u2013102\nfield, 64 of which are at zgal < zQSO . At the highest\nredshifts zabs \u2248 0.25, the survey covers a physical radius of \u2248 3 Mpc but not to faint intrinsic magnitudes\n(L \u2248 L\u2217 ).13 For the lowest redshift absorbers (z < 0.02),\nwe do not have the coverage to comment on large-scale\nstructures (\u03c1 \u2248 1\u20133 h\u22121\n75 Mpc) as in e.g., Penton et al.\n(2002) and Prochaska et al. (2006). For example, the\nfield-of-view covers only \u03c1 . 25 kpc around the C III system zabs = 0.00438, an absorber that is likely affiliated\nwith the Virgo cluster.\nTable 9 lists14 the galaxies are associated with the\nIGM systems by \u03b4vgal \u2261 c(zabs \u2212 zgal )/(1 + zabs ) \u2264\n1000 km s\u22121 . The velocity constraint comfortably covers the peculiar velocities expected for large-scale structures. In Figure 22, we show a histogram of the galaxy\nredshifts for the field surrounding PKS1302\u2013102 and,\nin Figure 24, the impact distribution of galaxies with\n|\u03b4vgal | < 1000 km s\u22121 from a metal-line system. Although an exact comparison of galaxy-absorber correlations cannot be performed between systems because the\nsurvey varies in field-of-view and depth with redshift, it\nis evident that the metal-line systems arise in a diverse\nset of galactic environments. For example, the partial\nLLS at z = 0.0949 is associated with a group of galaxies\nand quite likely is found within the halo of a L \u2248 0.2 L\u2217\ngalaxy at \u03c1 \u2248 65 h\u22121\n75 kpc. In contrast, the O VI absorber\nat z = 0.0646 is at least 300 h\u22121\n75 kpc away from any\ngalaxy with L > 0.01 L\u2217 and one identifies no obvious\nlarge scale-structure at this redshift. Let us now turn to\ndiscuss a few of these absorbers in greater detail.\nThere are three groups of metal-line absorbers with\n|\u03b4vabs | < 500 km s\u22121 at zabs \u2248 0.094, 0.192, and 0.225.\nThese groups may represent filamentary structures where\nthe H I and metal-line absorption arise in the gas between\nthe galaxies populating this large-scale structure (Bowen\net al. 2002). The zabs \u2248 0.094 group has ten detected\ngalaxies with 65 < \u03c1 < 800 h\u22121\n75 kpc and 0.1 < L/L\u2217 < 6.\nThe brightest galaxy is at \u03b4vgal = \u2212259 km s\u22121 from the\npartial Lyman-limit system zabs = 0.09487, with \u03c1 =\n331 h\u22121\n75 kpc. Both absorption systems near zabs \u2248 0.094\nhave C III absorption, and the partial LLS has Si III and\na broad O VI doublet. Chen et al. (2001a) have found\n13 In this paper, we assume a Hubble constant H\n0 =\n75 h75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and the absolute magnitude for L\u2217 at z = 0\nis MR = \u221221.04 (Blanton et al. 2003). This value is one magnitude\nfainter than the value used in Prochaska et al. (2006).\n14 See also http://www.ucolick.org/\u223cxavier/WFCCDOVI/\n\n\fIGM towards PKS1302\u2013102\n\n17\n\nFig. 23.- Galaxies with |\u03b4vgal | \u2264 1000 km s\u22121 from metal-line systems and strong Ly\u03b1 absorbers. The former have (blue) capital letters\nindicating the system they neighbor, while the latter have (white) lower case letters. The systems at zabs = 0.09400 and 0.09487 have\nmost all neighboring galaxies in common; they are not labeled twice. Similarly for the systems at zabs = 0.22555 and 0.22752. The O VI\nsystems are at zabs = 0.04222, 0.06471, 0.09487, and 0.22555 (B, C, D, and H, respectively). Aside from zabs = 0.14533 (F), the metal-line\nsystems are more likely probing the intra-group medium. (North is up, and east is left. PKS1302\u2013102 is indicated by a (red) capital Q.\nThere are about a dozen galaxies in the southeast corner that are either at higher redshift than PKS1302\u2013102 or not within 1000 km s\u22121\nof an intervening system.) The image is about 20\u2032 on a side.\n\nthat C IV absorption is strongly correlated with galax\u22121\nies with \u03b4vgal < 250 km s\u22121 and \u03c1 < 100 h75\nkpc. We\nhave searched for such absorption associated with the\n\u22121\ngalaxy at z = 0.09358 with \u03c1 = 65 h75\nkpc but unfortunately this places the doublet in the high-wavelength,\nlow-sensitivity end of the STIS E140M spectrum. We can\nplace an upper limit on the absorption: log N(C+3 ) <\n13.5. Given the small impact parameter of this galaxy\nto the PKS1302\u2013102 sightline, we tentatively associate\nthis galaxy with the partial LLS at z = 0.09487. This\nassociation is challenged by the observed velocity offset\n\u03b4vgal = \u2212354 km s\u22121 ; an association would require the\ngas to have a large inflow/outflow.\nThe group at zabs \u2248 0.192 has a strong H I Lyman absorber with C III, O VI 1031, and marginal Si III absorption and two Ly\u03b1 systems with log NHI > 13.8. There\n\nare four detected galaxies in this group, with 200 < \u03c1\n\u2264 520 h\u22121\n75 kpc and 0.4 < L/L\u2217 < 2.5. In the zabs \u2248 0.225\ngroup, there are five bright (L > 0.7 L\u2217) galaxies detected\nin the field with all but one at \u03c1 > 1 h\u22121\n75 Mpc. The 0.7L\u2217\ngalaxy in this group is \u03c1 = 416 h\u22121\nkpc\nfrom the tenta75\ntive O VI systems at zabs = 0.22555 (\u03b4vgal = 4 km s\u22121 )\nand 0.22752 (\u03b4vgal = \u2212477 km s\u22121 ).\nThere are very few galaxies in the survey around the\nremaining metal-line systems at zabs = 0.04222, 0.06471,\nand 0.14533 even though we probe similar impact parameters as the group at z = 0.2. The O VI systems at\nzabs = 0.04222 and 0.06471 each have two galaxies with\n|\u03b4vgal | < 160 km s\u22121 and 200 < \u03c1 < 500 h\u22121\n75 kpc. At\nthese redshifts, the survey is 100% within 200 kpc (2\u2032 )\nto L = 0.01 L\u2217 and 0.03 L\u2217, respectively (R = 20 mag).\nFor the zabs = 0.06471 system, the fainter galaxy (L \u2248\n\n\f18\n\nCooksey et al.\nTABLE 8\nOBJECT SUMMARY\nID\n\nRA\n\nDEC\n\nR\n(mag)\n\nS/Ga\n\nArea\n(\u0003\u2032\u2032 )\n\nflgb\n\nz\n\n4\n5\n107\n152\n171\n179\n234\n306\n329\n768\n\n13:04:56.0\n13:04:54.6\n13:06:21.4\n13:06:20.7\n13:06:19.5\n13:06:20.0\n13:06:17.0\n13:06:13.4\n13:06:15.4\n13:06:03.8\n\n\u201310:29:18\n\u201310:39:58\n\u201310:30:37\n\u201310:27:53\n\u201310:34:42\n\u201310:26:11\n\u201310:37:51\n\u201310:44:51\n\u201310:27:22\n\u201310:27:12\n\n18.11 \u00b1 0.02\n17.89 \u00b1 0.01\n17.29 \u00b1 0.01\n17.98 \u00b1 0.01\n17.34 \u00b1 0.01\n17.96 \u00b1 0.02\n18.94 \u00b1 0.03\n18.57 \u00b1 0.02\n18.70 \u00b1 0.02\n17.58 \u00b1 0.01\n\n0.09\n0.13\n0.25\n0.18\n0.22\n0.01\n0.89\n0.98\n0.13\n0.12\n\n6.8\n4.6\n7.3\n4.3\n4.2\n6.1\n4.2\n4.5\n4.9\n6.0\n\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n\n0.27252\n0.04576\n0.10819\n0.11608\n0.13839\n0.24866\n0.35805\n0.00000\n0.36601\n0.14202\n\nNote. - [The complete version of this table is in the electronic edition of\nthe Journal.

In\naddition, the two galaxies around zabs = 0.06471 have\nlarger \u03c1 than the galaxies near zabs = 0.04222. Since\nthe zabs = 0.06471 O VI system has lower log NHI and\nlog N(O+5 ), it may probe the extended halos of the\nnearby galaxies. The zabs = 0.04222 system, with O VI\nand C III, probably probes a multi-phase medium closer\nto the galaxies. Stocke et al. (2006) report that O VI systems with no C III absorption have larger nearest-galaxy\ndistances than systems with both lines detected.\nThere are four galaxies surrounding the zabs = 0.14533\nabsorber with \u03b4vgal < 500 km s\u22121 and 0.4 < L/L\u2217 <\n2.5, suggesting the gas arises in an intra-group medium\n(Mulchaey et al. 1996). However, one of these galaxies has a very small velocity offset and impact parameter (\u03b4vgal = \u22127 km s\u22121 and \u03c1 = 82 h\u22121\n75 kpc) and may\nhost the broad H I and C III absorption. As for the\nother strong Ly\u03b1 absorbers, there are surrounding galaxies with \u03b4vgal < 1000 km s\u22121 , except for zabs = 0.16935\nand 0.22457. However, no one bright and close galaxy appears as the source of the gas. The zabs = 0.16935 Ly\u03b1\nabsorber is obviously multi-component with no galaxies with \u03b4vgal < 1000 km s\u22121 and brighter than R =\n19.5 mag. The zabs = 0.22457 Ly\u03b1 absorber is \u03b4vgal <\n750 km s\u22121 from the metal-line systems at zabs \u2248 0.225\nand is probably associated.\nIt is illustrative to compare the galaxy-absorber connection by examining the properties of the 'nearest'\ngalaxy to each absorber and a characteristic of the largescale structure. Before proceeding, however, we wish to\ncaution that the nearest galaxy in this context corresponds to the galaxy with smallest impact parameter\nthat (i) has |\u03b4vgal | < 1000 km s\u22121 and (ii) is brighter\nthan the magnitude limit. In many cases, there may be\nno direct physical association between the galaxy and\nthe absorber.

The point types distinguish\nbetween metal-line systems (plus signs) and absorbers that only\nshow Ly\u03b1 absorption (crosses). There appears to be a trend toward\nlower \u03c1min values for higher NHI value of the absorbers.

In\nterms of the impact parameter, one notes a qualitative\ntrend of decreasing \u03c1min with increasing NHI that suggests a physical association between individual galaxies\nand absorbers for NHI & 1014.5 cm\u22122 (see also Chen et al.\n2005). At lower column densities (NHI . 1014 cm\u22122 ),\nthere is no discernible trend (for Ly\u03b1-only or metal-line\nsystems) which suggests these absorbers are predominantly associated with large-scale structures (e.g., intragroup material, filamentary structures).\nIf this qualitative picture is correct, one may comment\non the luminosities of the galaxies hosting absorbers.\nBased on the systems with \u03c1min < 100 h\u22121\n75 kpc, all of\nthe galaxies are sub-L\u2217 although we note that the partial LLS at z = 0.16 toward PKS0405\u2013123 also shows an\n\u22121\napproximately 2L\u2217 galaxy at \u03c1 < 100 h75\nkpc (Spinrad\net al. 1993). Of particular interest to examining the en-\n\n\fIGM towards PKS1302\u2013102\nrichment history of the IGM is to study the luminosity\nfunction of galaxies dominating such absorbers. We will\naddress these issues in greater depth in a future paper\nsummarizing our full set of galaxy surveys. Lastly, we\ncomment that the average ngal value may rise with NHI\nbut that there is apparently significant scatter in this\ncrude measure of galactic environment.\n8. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented the reduction and analysis of\narchival HST /STIS and FUSE UV spectra of the lowredshift quasar PKS1302\u2013102 (zQSO = 0.2784). We have\nidentified 90% of the potential Ly\u03b1 features in STIS and\n> 85% of the features in FUSE with > 4\u03c3 significance and\nFWHM = 20 km s\u22121 and 40 km s\u22121 , respectively . We\nalso performed a blind search for doublets without Ly\u03b1\nabsorption; there were no such systems in the PKS1302\u2013\n102 spectra. There are 28 Ly\u03b1 systems; 15 are strong\nabsorbers with log NHI > 14. Of those strong systems,\neight are metal-line systems: four with C III only, two\nwith C III and O VI absorption, and two tentative O VIonly systems (see Table 10). There is also a tentative\nO VI absorber with log NHI = 13.1 at zabs = 0.22752.\nThe unblocked redshift path length \u2206z for detecting\nLy\u03b1, C III, or the O VI doublet was measured for regions\nwhere the Wr \u2265 50 m\u00c5 absorption line(s) could be detected to > 3\u03c3 significance, excluding regions blocked\nby Galactic or IGM lines and within 1500 km s\u22121 of\nPKS1302\u2013102 (zQSO = 0.2784). We quote the 68%\nconfidence limits assuming Poisson statistics. With 28\nLy\u03b1 absorbers and \u2206z = 0.236, dNLy\u03b1 /dz = 118+14\n\u221212 ,\nwhich is consistent with other comparable published values, dNLy\u03b1 /dz & 100 for Wr \u2265 50 m\u00c5 (e.g., Tripp et al.\n1998; Penton et al. 2000). Similar to other published values (e.g., Richter et al. 2004; Prochaska et al. 2004; Danforth & Shull 2005), we derive dNOVI /dz = 7+9\n\u22124 for the\none doublet with both lines detected at 3\u03c3 and with Wr\n> 50 m\u00c5 for \u2206z = 0.152. On the other hand, we measure dNCIII /dz = 36+13\n\u22129 from the five detections with\nWr > 50 m\u00c5 over \u2206z = 0.138. For their entire sample, DSRS06 measure dNCIII /dz = 12+3\n\u22122 . We agree with\nDSRS06 on the number of O VI and C III absorbers in\nthe PKS1302\u2013102 sightline; the difference in redshift density for these species is likely due to fluctuations between\nsightlines.\nThe four systems with only one metal line are modeled\nwell by a single-phase absorber with [M/H] \u2248 \u22121, the\ncurrently favored value for NHI > 1014 cm\u22122 absorbers\nin the low-z IGM (Prochaska et al. 2004; Danforth et al.\n2006). The zabs = 0.00438, 0.09400, and 0.19161 systems are likely photoionized media. The zabs = 0.14533\nsystem may also be photoionized or collisionally ionized,\nassuming the Ly\u03b1 width is due to all thermal broadening.\nWith only an upper limit on C III absorption, the\nzabs = 0.06471 O VI system could be reasonably modeled\nby either a photoionized or collisionally-ionized medium.\nIf the latter, the temperature is constrained to be T >\n2.2 \u00d7 105 K, which could be a probe of the WHIM.\nThe zabs = 0.22555 O VI system might be a singlephase, collisionally-ionized absorber. No other metal\nlines were detected with the tentative O VI absorber at\nzabs = 0.22752, and no CLOUDY models were evaluated.\nFor the remaining two multiple metal-line systems,\nbased primarily on kinematic arguments, they are better\n\n19\n\nmodeled by a multi-phase medium. In the case of the\nzabs = 0.04222 system, both C III and O VI are narrow\nbut offset in by 50 km s\u22121 ; this system could be a twophase photoionized medium with [M/H] \u2248 \u22122 to \u22121.\nOn the other hand, O VI in the zabs = 0.09487 system\nis broad, implying a high temperature, while C III and\nSi III are narrow. Likely, the broad feature is due to a\ncollisionally-ionized phase, and the narrow features are\nfrom a photoionized phase. The system has a relatively\nlow metallicity, [M/H] \u2248 \u22122, for the photoionized gas.\nThe PKS1302\u2013102 sightline has a galaxy survey complement. The survey gives compelling evidence that the\nmetal-line absorption occurs in a diverse set of galactic\nenvironments. This includes a likely association with individual galactic halos (zabs = 0.09487, 0.14253), galaxy\ngroups (zabs = 0.094, 0.192, 0.225) and relatively poor environments (zabs = 0.06471). The survey does not cover\nsignificant area at zabs = 0.00438, the ninth metal-line\nsystem, but the sight line is known to pass through the\nVirgo cluster at this redshift.\nNone of the four O VI absorbers detected in the\nPKS1302\u2013102 spectra definitively trace the warm-hot intergalactic medium, which is defined to be collisionallyionized gas at T \u2248 105 \u2013107 K. The systems at zabs =\n0.06471 and 0.22555 may, though a firm conclusion is\ndifficult to draw. In agreement with previous analysis\n(Prochaska et al. 2004; Richter et al. 2004), we find O VI\nabsorption in a multi-phase medium. The two systems\nwith at least O VI and C III must be multi-phase since\nC IV is not detected and the line profiles show different kinematic structure. However, these systems do not\nnecessarily probe the WHIM, as seen in hydrodynamic\nsimulations. The metal-line systems appear to probe\nthe predominantly single-phase, photoionized intergalactic medium at low redshift.\nFrom 28 intergalactic absorption systems in one sightline, simple CLOUDY models, and a modest galaxy survey, we looked for qualitative relationships between the\nvarious systems and between the systems' environments.\nRoughly, one-third of Ly\u03b1 absorbers also have metalline absorption. Two of five O VI absorbers are clearly\nin multi-phase media. However, only one of the four\nhas strong evidence for being collisionally ionized and a\npotential WHIM candidate. The strong log NHI > 14\nsystems tend to be near galaxies (|\u03b4vgal | < 1000 km s\u22121\nand \u03c1 < 500 h\u22121\n75 kpc). The nearest galaxy distance tends\nto be correlated with H I absorption.\n\nBased on observations made with the NASA-CNESCSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer.
