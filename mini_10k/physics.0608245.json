Introduction\nThe two-body Coulomb problem is perhaps the most famous problem of quantum\nmechanics formulated on the basis of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation [1]. First solved\nanalytically for the bound states [1], it was then solved for scattering states [2], as\nwell as for the Green's function [3], [4], [5]. The situation is quite different for the\nsystems involving three and more charged particles. There is no analytic solution to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in this case and the problem exhibits a great complexity especially\nif the ionization process is energetically permitted. In this case, the infinitely many open\nexcitation channels are lead to extremely complicated behavior of the wave function,\nwhich asymptotically possesses infinitely many terms. Although definite progress has\nbeen made in the practical numerical solution of the three charged particles problem\nabove the disintegration threshold [6] by methods avoiding the explicit use of the wave\nfunction asymptotics, the theoretical status of the few-body Coulomb problem is still\nunsatisfactory in many respects. Among the very extensive literature devoted to the\nfew-body Coulomb problem, the following works [7], [8] and [9] refer to the theoretical\naspects of the problem.\nRecently we have presented a new method of handling the Coulomb potentials in the\nfew-body Hamiltonian with the help of the Coulomb-Fourier transform (CFT) [10]. The\nmethod allows us to exclude the long-range Coulomb interaction from the Hamiltonian\nby a specially constructed unitary transformation. This method was proven useful for\nrepulsive Coulomb interactions. In the case of attraction, the analytic closed form\nrepresentation for the projections onto the Coulomb bound-states subspace may lead to\na substantial simplification of the CFT method machinery. Although the latter was the\nprimary goal, it was found that the representations obtained, being quite general, are\nnot well addressed in the literature, and this has stimulated this publication.\nThe paper is organized from three sections. After the introduction, in the section\ntwo we derive representations for projection operators and consider some particular\ncases. The third section concludes the paper. Throughout the paper the bold letters,\ne.g. r, r\u2032, are used for vectors and not bold for their magnitudes, e.g. r = |r|. The unit\nvector associated with r will be denoted by r\u0302 = r/r.\n2.

Conclusion\nThe closed form representations are obtained for projections onto the n2 -dimensional\nsubspace spanned by bound-state eigenfunctions of the Coulomb Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to the principal quantum number n as well as for the projection onto the\nsubspace spanned by all Coulomb bound-states. These representations can be useful for\nsolving the few body scattering problem in a system of charged particles for energies\nabove the three body disintegration thresholds. The asymptotics computed above for\nthe projections Pn as n \u2192 \u221e may lead to drastic simplifications in calculating different\nCoulomb matrix elements between states which are spatially well confined. The analog\nof the Christoffel-Darboux summation formula for Laguerre polynomials which is derived\nas a particular case of the representations for the Coulomb projections can be useful for\nthe theory of classical orthogonal polynomials.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of S.
