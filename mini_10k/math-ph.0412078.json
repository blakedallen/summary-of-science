We study spectra of Schr\u00f6dinger operators on Rd . First we consider a pair of operators which differ by a compactly supported potential, as\nwell as the corresponding semigroups. We prove almost exponential decay\nof the singular values \u03bcn of the difference of the semigroups as n \u2192 \u221e and\ndeduce bounds on the spectral shift function of the pair of operators.\nThereafter we consider alloy type random Schr\u00f6dinger operators. The single site potential u is assumed to be non-negative and of compact support.\nThe distributions of the random coupling constants are assumed to be H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous. Based on the estimates for the spectral shift function, we prove a\nWegner estimate which implies H\u00f6lder continuity of the integrated density of\nstates.\n\n1. Introduction and Results\nIn this paper we analyze the spectral properties of multi dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger\noperators. First, we consider a pair of operators H1 , H2 which differ by a compactly\nsupported potential u. The singular values \u03bcn of the difference of the corresponding\nexponentials Veff := e\u2212H1 \u2212 e\u2212H2 are shown to decay almost exponentially in n.\nThis result allows us to deduce a bound on the Lifshitz-Krein spectral shift\nfunction (SSF) of the operator pair H1 , H2 . We give a bound on the SSF when\nintegrated over the energy axis against a bounded, compactly supported function.\nIn turn, the bound on the SSF is used to prove a Wegner estimate for random\nSchr\u00f6dinger operators of alloy type and H\u00f6lder continuity of the integrated density\nof states (IDS). Our estimates have a better continuity in the energy parameter\nthan previously known bounds. Moreover, we are able to treat random coupling\nconstants, whose distribution does not have a density. In particular, for H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous distributions we prove that the IDS is H\u00f6lder continuous, too.\nWe will treat magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger operators\n(1)\n\nH = HA + V = (\u2212i\u2207 \u2212 A)2 + V\n\nacting on Rd whose potentials (magnetic and electric) obey the following hypotheses: Each component of A is L2loc . The positive part of the electric potential,\nV+ := max(0, V ), belongs to L1loc and the negative part, V\u2212 := max(0, \u2212V ), is in\nthe Kato class. Notice that under our convention, V = V+ \u2212 V\u2212 .\nDate: October 5, 2018, HundertmarkKNSV-041221.tex.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35J10,81Q10.\nKey words and phrases. integrated density of states, random Schr\u00f6dinger operators, alloy type\nmodel.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. HUNDERTMARK, R. KILLIP, S. NAKAMURA, P. STOLLMANN, AND I. VESELI\u0106\n\nFor a general discussion of the Kato-class, see [15]; for its relevance to the\nFeynman-Kac formula see, e.g., [2, 6, 49]. In particular, V\u2212 is in the Kato-class, if\n\u0010Z\n\u00111/p\np\nkV\u2212 kLloc,unif (Rd ) = sup\n|V\u2212 (y) dy|\n<\u221e\nx\u2208Rd\n\n|x\u2212y|\u22641\n\nwhere p = 1 if d = 1 and p > d/2 if d \u2265 2. Thus the allowed potentials cover all\nphysically relevant cases.\nUnder these hypotheses, one may define H via the corresponding quadratic form\n(with core Cc\u221e ). By the same method, one can define the Dirichlet restriction of\nH to the cube \u039bl = [\u2212l/2, l/2]d, l \u2265 1. This will be denoted H l .\nLet H1 be a Schr\u00f6dinger operator of the form just described and let H2 = H1 + u\nwhere u = u+ \u2212 u\u2212 obeys the hypotheses for electric potentials just described.\nThe starting point for our analysis is an estimate on the singular values of Veff :=\ne\u2212H1 \u2212 e\u2212H2 and on the corresponding object in the finite volume case, namely\nl\nl\nl\nVeff\n:= e\u2212H1 \u2212 e\u2212H2 . Recall that the singular values of a compact operator A are\nthe square-roots of the eigenvalues of A\u2217 A. We will enumerate them as \u03bc1 (A) \u2265\n\u03bc2 (A) \u2265 * * * \u2265 0 according to multiplicity.\n\nTheorem 1. There are finite positive constants c and C such that the singular\nl\nvalues of the operator Veff\nobey\n(2)\n\n1/d\n\n\u03bcn \u2264 C e\u2212cn\n\n.\n\nIn fact, c may be chosen depending only on the dimension, while C depends on the\nKato-class norms of u\u2212 , V\u2212 and on the diameter of the support of u+ .\nThe same estimate holds for the singular values of Veff .\nP\nl\nl\nis an element of\nkJp := n \u03bcpn is finite and thus Veff\nRemarks: i) In particular kVeff\nthe operator ideal Jp := {A compact | kAkJp < \u221e} for any p > 0. Thus our result\ncan be understood as a sharpening and generalization of norm, Hilbert Schmidt,\nand trace bounds on the difference of semigroups, derived e.g. in [7, 8, 9, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 48, 51, 52].\nii) Note that the estimate (2) depends on the positive part of u only through\nsupp u. Thus, for u = \u03bb\u0169 where \u0169 \u2265 0 and \u03bb is a non-negative coupling constant,\nthe estimate is independent of the choice of \u03bb. Moreover\n(1) u may be taken to +\u221e on its support. In this case H2 equals the restriction\nof H1 to Rd \\ supp u with Dirichlet boundary conditions, provided the boundary of\nsupp u obeys some mild regularity conditions; see, e.g., [53].\n(2) Similarly, H1 may be defined on a set strictly smaller than Rd : Let D \u2282\nD\nD\nbe open, HA\nthe Dirichlet restriction of HA on D, and H1 = HA\n+ V where V\nl\nsatisfies the same conditions as before. In this case Hj is the Dirichlet restriction\nof Hj , j = 1, 2 to the set \u039bl \u2229 D.\niii) The proof of Theorem 1 is surprisingly simple. Morally, the result is an immediate consequence of Weyl's law for the eigenvalue asymptotic of Dirichlet Laplacians\non compact domains. This suggest that the decay rate of the singular values of\ne\u2212H1 \u2212 e\u2212H2 is, in fact, given by exp(\u2212cn2/d ). One might ask, however, whether\nthe singular values could not typically decay at a much faster rate. It turns out\nthat a decay rate like exp(\u2212cn\u03b1 ) for \u03b1 > 2/d is impossible, see Remark ii) after\nTheorem 2 below. This leaves open the cases \u03b1 \u2208 (1/d, 2/d]. We conjecture that,\nin fact, the true bound is of the form \u03bcn \u2264 C exp(\u2212cn2/d ).\n\n\fSPECTRAL SHIFT AND WEGNER ESTIMATES\n\n3\n\nOur interest in Theorem 1 comes from the fact that it allows us to derive an\nintegral bound on the the SSF \u03be(\u03bb, H2 , H1 ) of the pair of operators H1 , H2 , which\nshows that the SSF can have only very mild local singularities. (See Section 2.1\nfor a precise definition of the SSF.) The SSF plays a role in different areas of\nmathematical physics, for instance in scattering theory, cf. e.g. [59], and the study\nof surface potentials, see [10, 36]. Various of its properties are discussed in the\nliterature: monotonicity and concavity in [20, 22, 35], the asymptotic behaviour in\nthe large coupling constant [43, 46, 44] and semiclassical limit [42, 40]. See [5, 34]\nfor surveys.\nFor t > 0 let Ft : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) be defined by\nZ x\n(3)\nFt (x) =\n(exp(ty 1/d ) \u2212 1) dy.\n0\n\nAs the integrand is increasing, Ft is a convex function.\n\nTheorem 2. Let \u03be be the spectral shift function for the pair H1 , H2 or H1l , H2l .\ni) Let Ft be defined as above. There exisits a constant K1 , depending on t, such\nthat for small enough t > 0,\nZ T\nFt (|\u03be(\u03bb)|) d\u03bb \u2264 K1 eT < \u221e\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nfor all T < \u221e.\nii) There exists constants K1 , K2 depending only on d, diam supp u+ and the Kato\nclass norms of V\u2212 , u\u2212 , such that for any bounded compactly supported function f ,\nZ\n(5)\nf (\u03bb) \u03be(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2264 K1 eb + K2 {log(1 + kf k\u221e )}d kf k1\nwith b = sup supp(f ).\n\nRemarks: i) Note that the function Ft defined in (3) has the asymptotic behavior\nFt (x) \u223c d x(d\u22121)/d exp(tx1/d )\n\nfor large x.\n\nThus, by part i) of Theorem 2, the spectral shift function can have at most mild\nlogarithmic local singularities. It is tempting to think that, at least for non-negative\ncompactly supported perturbations, the spectral shift function should always be\nbounded. However, this is not the case. For a perturbation of the free Schr\u00f6dinger\noperator with a constant magnetic field by a compactly supported potential, Raikov\nand Warzel showed that spectral shift function diverges at each Landau level Eq\nlike\n\u0010 | ln(\u03bb)| \u0011d/2\nas \u03bb \u2193 0,\n(6)\n|\u03be(Eq + \u03bb)| \u223c\nln | ln \u03bb|\n\nsee [45] for the caseR d = 2 and [39] for the generalization to even dimensions. Thus,\nx\nsetting Ft,\u03b1 (x) := 0 (exp(ty \u03b1 ) \u2212 1) dy, the asymptotic (6) implies that Ft,\u03b1 (|\u03be|) is\nlocally integrable if and only if 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2/d, whereas Theorem 2 guarantees it only\nfor \u03b1 \u2264 1/d (and t small enough, if \u03b1 = 1/d).\nii) The proof of Theorem 2 shows that if Theorem 1 holds in the form \u03bcn \u2264\nc1 exp(\u2212c2 n\u03b1 ), then Ft,\u03b1 (|\u03be|) \u2208 L1 (\u2212\u221e, T ) for small enough t (and all finite T ).\nThus the Raikov-Warzel result shows that the estimate in Theorem 1 cannot be\nimproved beyond C exp(\u2212cn2/d ).\n\n\f4\n\nD. HUNDERTMARK, R. KILLIP, S. NAKAMURA, P. STOLLMANN, AND I. VESELI\u0106\n\niii) An example without magnetic fields, where the SSF shows unexpected divergencies, was studied by Kirsch in [28, 29]. It is related to the one with a constant magnetic field in that the high degeneracy of eigenvalues plays a crucial role.\nLet E > 0, u non-negative, bounded with compact support, and not identically\nequal to zero, a : [0, \u221e) \u2192 (0, \u221e), and \u03bel (*) := \u03be(*, \u2212\u2206l , (\u2212\u2206 + a(l)u)l ). Then\nlim supl\u2192\u221e \u03bel (E) = \u221e, for any E, a and u as above. This result relies on the degeneracy of eigenvalues of the pure Dirichlet Laplacian on a cube. There is, however,\na set of full measure E \u2282 R with dense complement such that limN\u220bl\u2192\u221e \u03bel (E) = 0,\nfor all E \u2208 E, if a(l) \u2264 l\u2212k , k > 3.\niv) In contrast to the above unboundedness results, Sobolev, [50] showed that for\nthe pair H1 = \u2212\u2206 and H2 = \u2212\u2206+u with |u(x)| \u2264 const. (1+|x|)\u2212\u03b1 and \u03b1 > d, the\nspectral shift function \u03be is, indeed, locally bounded. However, this type of result\nseems to require very strong hypotheses on H1 , for example, a limiting absorption\nprinciple and in particular, that H1 has absolutely continuous spectrum on the\npositive real axis.\nTheorem 2.ii) has a nice consequence in the theory of random Schr\u00f6dinger operators. In this case, we take f to be the the derivative of a smooth, monotone\nswitch function \u03c1 := \u03c1E,\u03b5 : R \u2192 [\u22121, 0]. By a switch function we mean that for a\npositive \u03b5 \u2264 1/2 it has the following properties: \u03c1 \u2261 \u22121 on (\u2212\u221e, E \u2212 \u03b5], \u03c1 \u2261 0 on\n[E + \u03b5, \u221e) and k\u03c1\u2032 k\u221e \u2264 1/\u03b5. Theorem 2.ii) and the Krein trace identity, see \u00a72.1,\nthen imply that there is a constant CE such that\n(7)\n\nTr [\u03c1(H2 ) \u2212 \u03c1(H1 )] \u2264 CE | log(\u03b5)|d .\n\nThe estimate (7) improves upon the bound derived by Combes, Hislop and Nakamura in [14]. They prove that for any exponent \u03b1 < 1, there is a constant C\u0303E (\u03b1)\ndepending only on d, C0 , diam supp u, E + \u03b5 and \u03b1 such that\n(8)\n\nTr [\u03c1(H2 ) \u2212 \u03c1(H1 )] \u2264 C\u0303E (\u03b1) \u03b5\u2212\u03b1 .\n\nAn alloy type model is a random Schr\u00f6dinger operator H\u03c9 = H0 + V\u03c9 , where\nH0 = HA + Vper with aPperiodic potential Vper . The random part of the potential\nhas the form V\u03c9 (x) = k\u2208Zd \u03c9k u(x \u2212 k). The coupling constants \u03c9k , k \u2208 Zd , are\na sequence of bounded random variables, which are independent and identically\nN\ndistributed with distribution \u03bc. The expectation of the product measure k\u2208Zd \u03bc\nis denoted by E. The single site potential u 6\u2261 0 is of compact support. Denote for\n\u03b5>0\n(9)\n\ns(\u03bc, \u03b5) = sup{\u03bc([E \u2212 \u03b5, E + \u03b5]) | E \u2208 R}.\n\nWith this definition, we have\n\nTheorem 3. Let H\u03c9 be an alloy type model and u \u2265 \u03ba\u03c7[\u22121/2,1/2]d for some positive\n\u03ba. Then for each E0 \u2208 R there exists a constant CW such that, for all E \u2264 E0 and\n\u03b5 \u2264 1/2\n(10)\n\nE{Tr[\u03c7[E\u2212\u03b5,E+\u03b5] (H\u03c9l )]} \u2264 CW s(\u03bc, \u03b5) (log 1\u03b5 )d |\u039bl |\n\nIn particular, if \u03bc is H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent \u03b1, then the \u03b5-dependence\nof the RHS of (10) is \u03b5\u03b1 (log 1\u03b5 )d . In [54], Stollmann proved a weaker version of (10)\nwith RHS equal to CW s(\u03bc, \u03b5) |\u039bl |2 .\nBounds like (10) are called Wegner estimates. They were first deduced by physical reasoning by Wegner in [58] for the Anderson model, the finite difference analogue of the alloy type model. Wegner estimates are important a priori estimates,\n\n\fSPECTRAL SHIFT AND WEGNER ESTIMATES\n\n5\n\nused to derive regularity properties of the integrated density of states (IDS) and to\nprove localization for random Schr\u00f6dinger operators. In this context, localization\nmeans the existence of an energy region where the random operator has almost\nsurely dense pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. See,\ne.g., [55] for a monograph exposition and, e.g., [21] (and the references therein) for\nmore recent developments.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 can be directly applied to the Anderson model. In this\ncase, one obtains a bound like (10) with the RHS side equal to CW s(\u03bc, \u03b5) |\u039b| and\nthe constant CW independent of the energy E. This gives an easy proof of a Wegner\nestimate for H\u00f6lder continuous single site distributions \u03bc.\nThe IDS N (E) is defined as the limit of the distribution functions,\nN\u03c9l (E) := |\u039bl |\u22121 #{ eigenvalues of H\u03c9l not greater than E},\nas l tends to infinity. For almost all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 the limit exists and is independent of\n\u03c9. As a consequence of Theorem 3, the IDS of the above alloy-type model satisfies\n\u0013d\n\u0012\n1\n, |E1 \u2212 E2 | \u2264 1/2,\n|N (E1 ) \u2212 N (E2 )| \u2264 CI s(\u03bc, |E1 \u2212 E2 |) log\n|E1 \u2212 E2 |\n\nwhere the constant CI may be chosen uniformly if E1 and E2 vary in a compact\ninterval I. Note that this continuity result cannot be obtained from a Wegner\nestimate with quadratic dependence on the volume of the box \u039bl . It also shows\nthat, up to a logarithmic correction, the IDS enjoys the same regularity properties\nas the distribution of the random potential.\nLet us return to the discussion of the regularity of the SSF. Denote by H1 =\nH\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 u and H2 = H1 + u the alloy type operators where the value of the coupling\nconstant at k = 0 is frozen and equal to 0 and 1 respectively. The other coupling\nconstants are still random. Despite the examples given above it is still possible\nthat the average of the SSF \u03be\u0304(\u03bb) := E{\u03be(\u03bb, H1 , H2 )} over the random background\nenvironment is locally bounded. This then implies no logarithmic loss in the Wegner\nestimate, and thus the Lipschitz continuity of the integrated density of states.\nIndeed, such a bound on \u03be \u0304 for d \u2264 3 has recently been announced by Combes and\nHislop, [23]. They have to assume that the single site distribution has a bounded\ndensity with respect to Lebesgue measure. So far, the averaging techniques at our\n \u0304\ndisposal do not seem to be sufficient enough to prove that \u03be(\u03bb)\nis locally bounded\nfor rough single site distributions, even if they are H\u00f6lder continuous.\nIn this context we would like to mention bounds on averaged fractional powers\nof the SSF derived in [1].\nAs a final remark, we discuss how Theorem 2 can be used to improve Wegner\nestimates for alloy type models with somewhat different properties than in Theorem\n3. First we present an improvement of a recent Wegner estimate by Combes, Hislop\nand Klopp [12] for single site potentials with small support.\nTheorem 4. Let H\u03c9 be an alloy type model as defined in the paragraph follwing\n(8). Assume that Vper has the unique continuation property and is bounded below,\n\u03c9 is distributed according to a bounded density and 0 \u2264 u \u2208 L\u221e is strictly positive\non an open set. Then for each E0 \u2208 R there exists a constant CW such that\n\u0013d\n\u0012\n1\nl\n|\u039b|\n(11)\nE{Tr\u03c7[E\u2212\u03b5,E+\u03b5] (H\u03c9 )} \u2264 CW \u03b5 log\n\u03b5\n\n\f6\n\nD. HUNDERTMARK, R. KILLIP, S. NAKAMURA, P. STOLLMANN, AND I. VESELI\u0106\n\nfor all E \u2264 E0 and \u03b5 \u2264 1/2.\nThis follows directly if one uses Theorem 2 instead of the Lp -estimates on the\nSSF in the Appendix of [12].\nWe mention three more disorder regimes where Theorem 2 may be used to simplify proofs of earlier Wegner estimates and to improve the dependence of the\nestimate in the energy interval length.\n(1) Single site potentials with small support and singular coupling constants. Using\nthe perturbation technique of Kirsch, Stollmann and Stolz in [32], we can extend\nthe result from Theorem 3 to single site potentials u \u2265 \u03ba\u03c7[\u2212s,s]d for some \u03ba, s > 0\nin the case of zero magnetic field for energies near spectral edges. In this case no\nassumption on the unique continuation property is needed.\n(2) Coupling constants whose distribution is continuous merely at the extreme values. In [33], Kirsch and Veseli\u0107 prove a Wegner estimate for alloy type potentials\nwith non-positive single site potentials and coupling constants which have merely\nin a neighborhood of their maximal value a continuous distribution with bounded\ndensity. The estimate applies to energies at the bottom of the spectrum. Using\nTheorem 2 in the present paper, one can improve the Wegner estimate in [33].\n(3) Single site potentials with changing sign. In [24], Hislop and Klopp studied alloy\ntype models with continuous, compactly supported single site potentials, which may\ntake values with both signs, and bounded coupling constants which are distributed\naccording to a bounded, piecewise absolutely continuous density. They prove a\nWegner estimate which is H\u00f6lder continuous in the energy variable and applies to\nenergies below the spectrum of the non-random, unperturbed operator H0 . The\nresult extends to internal spectral boundaries in the weak disorder regime. An\nextension of Theorem 2 in the present paper to the case where the perturbation is\nequal to a potential sandwiched between the square roots of the resolvent would\nmake it possible to improve the Wegner estimate in [24] with regards to the energy\ninterval length.\nFurther results on Wegner estimates for alloy type Schr\u00f6dinger operators can\nbe inferred from [4, 13, 27, 30, 31, 36, 56, 57] and the references therein. Let us\nmention specifically, that if \u03bc has bounded density and u \u2265 \u03ba\u03c7\u039b1 the IDS is actually\nLipschitz-continuous, see [37, 11].\nLet us sketch the outline of the paper: The next section contains the definition\nof the SSF and the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2. In Section 3 we prove a lemma\nwhich is needed to deal with singular coupling constants and complete the proof of\nthe Wegner estimate, Theorem 3.\n2. Bounds on the SSF\n2.1. Definition of the SSF. We define the SSF in three steps. Each of them\nextends the definition to a larger class of operators. For proofs see, e.g., [5] or [59].\nAssume first that H1 , H2 are selfadjoint, lower-semibounded with purely discrete\nspectrum. Then the SSF is defined as the difference of the eigenvalue counting\nfunctions,\n\u03be(\u03bb) := #{n | \u03bbn (H2 ) \u2264 \u03bb} \u2212 #{n | \u03bbn (H1 ) \u2264 \u03bb},\n\nwhere \u03bbn (H) enumerates the spectrum of H, including multiplicity, in increasing\norder. Consider now a pair of selfadjoint, lower-semibounded operators such that\n\n\fSPECTRAL SHIFT AND WEGNER ESTIMATES\n\n7\n\nthe difference H2 \u2212 H1 is trace class. Then there is a unique function \u03be such that\nKrein's trace identity\nZ\n(12)\nTr [\u03c1(H2 ) \u2212 \u03c1(H1 )] = \u03c1\u2032 (\u03bb) \u03be(\u03bb, H2 , H1 ) d\u03bb\n\nholds for all \u03c1 \u2208 C \u221e with compactly supported derivative (actually, \u03c1 can be taken\nto lie in a certain Besov space, see [41]). If the operators have discrete spectrum,\nthis definition of \u03be coincides with the previous one. It can be recovered choosing a\nsequence of \u03c1\u03b5 which converges to a step function as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nFinally, we weaken the trace class assumption on the operator difference. Let\ng : R \u2192 [0, \u221e) be a monotone, smooth function such that g(H2 ) \u2212 g(H1 ) is trace\nclass. Assume that g is bounded on the spectra of H1 and H2 . Then the SSF for\nthe operator pair g(H1 ), g(H2 ) is well defined and we may set\n\u0001\n(13)\n\u03be(\u03bb, H2 , H1 ) := sign(g \u2032 ) \u03be g(\u03bb), g(H2 ), g(H1 ) .\n\nThis definition is independent of the choice of g. Formula (13) is called the invariance principle. This last definition will be sufficiently general to cover the\nSchr\u00f6dinger operators we are considering. In the sequel we will choose g(x) = e\u2212x .\nAlternatively, the SSF can be defined via the perturbation determinant from\nscattering theory by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u03be(\u03bb, H1 , H2 ) := lim arg det 1 + (H1 \u2212 H2 )(H2 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 i\u03b5)\u22121 )\n\u03c0 \u03b5\u05810\n\nif (H1 \u2212 H2 )(H2 + i)\u22121 is trace class.\n\n2.2. Decay of singular values. Weyl's asymptotic law gives the asymptotic behaviour of the nth eigenvalue of the Laplacian on an open ball B for large n. The\nfollowing simple lemma provides a robust lower bound, very much in the spirit of\nWeyl's law, but valid for all n and for general magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger operators. It\nis the starting point for our proof of Theorem 1.\nAs it costs us nothing in clarity, the lemma will be presented under weaker\nhypotheses than those described in the introduction.\nLemma 5. Let H = HA + V = (\u2212i\u2207 \u2212 A)2 + V as in the introduction (cf. (1)),\nexcept that we now require that V\u2212 is merely \u2212\u2206 bounded with relative bound \u03b4 < 1.\nFurthermore, let H U be the Dirichlet restriction of H to an arbitrary open set U\nwith finite volume |U| (also defined via the corresponding quadratic forms). Then,\nfor some constant C, the nth eigenvalue of H U = HA + W satisfies\n2\u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03b4)d \u0010 n \u00112/d\n\u2212C\nfor all n \u2208 N.\n(14)\nEn \u2265\ne\n|U|\n\nProof. Since the Dirichlet Sobolev space H01 (U) is a natural subset of H 1 (Rd ), V\u2212 is\nalso relatively form bounded w.r.t. \u2212\u2206U , the Dirichlet Laplacian on U with relative\nbound \u03b4. The diamagnetic inequality, [48], then implies that V\u2212 is also relative form\nbounded w.r.t. to the Dirichlet restriction of HA to U. That is, there exists a C \u2208 R\nsuch that, as quadratic forms,\nV\u2212 \u2264 \u03b4HA + C.\nIn particular, since V+ is non-negative,\nH U \u2265 HA \u2212 V\u2212 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)HA \u2212 C,\n\n\f8\n\nD.

We will use the symbols c and C for constants that vary from line\nto line; however, their dependence on H1 and H2 will always be as stated in the\nTheorem.\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that the origin is contained in the\nsupport of u.

Using the invariance principle and a change of variables, we have\nZ T\nZ T\nF (|\u03be(\u03bb, H2 , H1 )|) d\u03bb =\nF (|\u03be(e\u2212\u03bb , e\u2212H2 , e\u2212H1 )|) d\u03bb\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\nT\n\u2264e\nF (|\u03be(s, e\u2212H2 , e\u2212H1 )|) ds\ne\u2212T\n\nBy an estimate of Hundertmark and Simon [25], the integral on the RHS is\nbounded by\nZ \u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\u03bcn (Veff )(F (n) \u2212 F (n \u2212 1))\nF (|\u03be(s, e\u2212H2 , e\u2212H1 )|) ds \u2264\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2264\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bcn (Veff )\n\nn=1\n\nZ\n\nn\n\nn\u22121\n\n1/d\n\n(ets\n\n\u2212 1)ds \u2264 C\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1/d\n\ne(t\u2212c)n\n\nn=1\n\nwhich is finite, if we chose t smaller than the constant c from Theorem 1. This\nproves (4).\nTo prove (5), we dualize the bound (4) with the help of Young's inequality for an\nappropriate pair of functions. Note that Ft is non-negative, convex with Ft\u2032 (0) = 0\nand hence its Legendre transform G is well defined and satisfies\n\u0010 log(1 + y) \u0011d\nfor all y \u2265 0\nG(y) := sup{xy \u2212 F (x)} \u2264 y\nt\nx\u22650\n\nThus, by the very definition of G, Young's inequality holds: yx \u2264 F (x) + G(y). So,\nwith b = sup supp(f ),\nZ\nZ b\nZ\n(17)\nf (\u03bb)\u03be(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2264\nF (|\u03be(\u03bb)|) d\u03bb + G(|f (\u03bb)|) d\u03bb\n\u2212\u221e\n\nUsing the estimate (4), the first integral is bounded by K1 eb . For the second integral\nin (17), we estimate\nZ\nZ\n\u0010 log(1 + |f (\u03bb)|) \u0011d\nG(|f (\u03bb)|) d\u03bb \u2264 |f (\u03bb)|\nd\u03bb \u2264 t\u2212d | log(1 + kf k\u221e )|d kf k1 .\nt\nThis finishes the proof of Theorem 2.\n\u0003\n3. Proof of the Wegner estimate\n3.1. A partial integration formula for singular distributions. The main new\nidea to deal with single site distributions that are not absolutely continuous, is the\nfollowing simple\nLemma 6. Let \u03bc be a probability measure with support in (a, b)) (or (a, \u221e), if its\nsupport is unbounded from above) and \u03c6 \u2208 C 1 (R) be non-decreasing and bounded.\nThen for any \u03b5 > 0,\nZ\n[\u03c6(\u03bb + \u03b5) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03bb)] d\u03bc(\u03bb) \u2264 s(\u03bc, \u03b5) * [\u03c6(b + \u03b5) \u2212 \u03c6(a)]\nR\n\nwhere s(\u03bc, \u03b5), the modulus of continuity of \u03bc, is defined in (9).(If b = \u221e, \u03c6(b + \u01eb)\nmeans limx\u2192\u221e \u03c6(x), which exists by the properties of \u03c6.)\n\n\fSPECTRAL SHIFT AND WEGNER ESTIMATES\n\n11\n\nProof. The proof of this lemma follows immediately from the well-known integrationby-parts formula for Stieltjes integrals. We include it for the convenience of the\nreader. We write d\u03bc = dM , where M is the distribution function of \u03bc. In the following, all integrals are defined as Stieltjes integrals. Shifting variables and using\nthat M is constant outside of [a, b] gives\nZ\nZ b+\u03b5\n\u03c6(\u03bb) d[M (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 M (\u03bb)].\n[\u03c6(\u03bb + \u03b5) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03bb)] d\u03bc(\u03bb) =\na\n\nIntegrating by parts gives\nZ\nh\nib+\u03b5\n[\u03c6(\u03bb + \u03b5) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03bb)] d\u03bc(\u03bb) = \u03c6(\u03bb)[M (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 M (\u03bb)]\na\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nb+\u03b5\n\na\n\n\u03c6\u2032 (\u03bb)[M (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 M (\u03bb)] d\u03bb.\n\nThe first term is zero, since M is constant outside of [a, b] (in case b = \u221e, one\nuses boundedness of \u03c6 and lim\u03bb\u2192\u221e [M (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b5) \u2212 M (\u03bb)] = 0).
