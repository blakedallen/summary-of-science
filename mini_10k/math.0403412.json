Email : roy@math.hu-berlin.de\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\nOn a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9), the completely integrable systems (CI in\nshort) are the dynamical systems defined by a Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M) admitting a momentum map, i.e. a set A = (A1 , ..., Ad ) : M \u2192 Rd of smooth\nfunctions, d being half of the dimension of M, satisfying {Aj , H} = 0 and\n{Aj , Ak } = 0 for all j, k : 1...d, and whose differentials dAj are linearly independent almost everywhere. Then, the Arnol'd-Mineur-Liouville Theorem\n[1, 7, 6] insures that in a neighbourhood of any connected component of any\ncompact regular fiber A\u22121 (a), a \u2208 Rd , there exists a fibration in lagrangian\ntori along which H is constant. These tori are thus invariant by the dynamics\ngenerated by the associated Hamiltonian vector field XH .\nDespite the \"local\" character of the Arnol'd-Mineur-Liouville Theorem,\none might be tempted to try to glue together these \"local\" fibrations in the\ncase of regular Hamiltonians, i.e. those for which there exists, near each point\nof M, a local fibration in invariant lagrangian tori. Nevertheless, we would\nlike to stress the fact that not all regular completely integrable Hamiltonians\nare constant along the fibers of a fibration in lagrangian tori. For example,\na free particle moving on the sphere S 2 can be described by a Hamiltonian\nsystem on the symplectic manifold T \u2217 S 2 . If we restrict ourself to the symplectic manifold M = T \u2217 S 2 \\ S 2 , we can easily show that M is diffeomorphic to\nSO (3)\u00d7R and that the Hamiltonian H depends only on the second factor. The\nenergy levels H = cst are thus diffeomorphic to SO (3). On the other hand,\nif there exists a fibration in lagrangian tori such that H is constant along the\nfibers, then each energy level is itself fibered by tori. But a simple homotopy\ngroup argument shows that there exists no fibration of SO (3) by tori.\nThis example actually belongs to the non-generic (within the class of regular CI Hamiltonians) class of degenerate Hamiltonians. Those Hamiltonians\nmight not admit any (global) fibration in lagrangian tori, or they might admit\nseveral different ones. But, as we will see, imposing a nondegeneracy condition insures that there exists a global a fibration of M in lagrangian tori along\nwhich H is constant, and moreover that it is unique.\nOn the other hand, nondegeneracy conditions arise in the K.A.M. theory\nwhere one studies the small perturbations H + \u03b5K of a given CI Hamiltonian\nH. The K.A.M. Theorem actually deals with the regular part of a completely\nintegrable system and is usually expressed in angle-action coordinates. This\ntheorem actually gives two independent statements. The first statement is that\nthe tori on which XH verifies a certain diophantine relation are only slightly\ndeformed and not destroyed by the perturbation \u03b5K, provided \u03b5 is sufficiently\nsmall. The second statement is that the set of these tori has a large mesure\nwhenever H is non-degenerate.\nThere exist different K.A.M. theorems based on different nondegeneracy\nconditions, such as the earliest ones of Arnol'd [1] and Kolmogorov [5], or\nthose introduced later by Bryuno [2] and R\u00fcssmann [8]. They are always presented in action-angle coordinates and this hides somehow their geometrical\ncontent. But they can be expressed in a geometric way if we consider CI systems defined on a symplectic manifold M by a fibration in lagrangian tori\n2\n\n\f\u03c0\n\nM \u2192 B, where B is any manifold, together with a Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M)\nconstant along the fibers \u03c0 \u22121 (b), b \u2208 B. Such a Hamiltonian must have the\nform H = F \u25e6 \u03c0, with F \u2208 C \u221e (B), and all the nondegeneracy conditions express simply in function of F and of a torsion-free and flat connection which\nnaturally exists on the base space B of the fibration.\nIn the first section, we review the geometric structures associated with a\nfibration in lagrangian tori that allow one to define the connection on the base\nspace. In Section 2, we give several nondegeneracy conditions, including those\nmentionned above, expressed both in a geometric way and in flat coordinates.\nThen, we show in Section 3 the different implication relations that exist between these different conditions. Finally, in the last section, we give some\nproperties of non-degenerate CI hamiltonians, as for example the uniqueness\nof the fibration in lagrangian tori.\n\n1 Geometric setting\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a symplectic manifold of dimension 2d and let H, M \u2192 B be a\n\u03c0\n\nregular CI system composed of a fibration in lagrangian tori M \u2192 B together\nwith a Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M) constant along the fibers Mb = \u03c0 \u22121 (b),\nb \u2208 B. Since by definition the fibers are connected, H must be of the form\nH = F \u25e6 \u03c0, with F \u2208 C \u221e (B). On the other hand, Duistermaat showed in [4]\nthat there exists a natural torsion-free and flat connection \u2207 on the base space\nB of each fibration in lagrangian tori. It can be seen as follows.\nFirst of all, a theorem due to Weinstein [9, 10] insures that there exists\na natural torsion-free and flat connection on each leaf of a lagrangian foliation. Moreover, whenever this foliation defines locally a fibration, then the\nholonomy\nof\u0011the connection must vanish. Given a fibration in lagrangian tori\n\u0010\n\u03c0\n\nH, M \u2192 B , the space V\u2207 (Mb ) of parallel vector fields on Mb = \u03c0 \u22121 (b), for\nS\neach b \u2208 B, is thus a vector space of dimension d, and the union b\u2208B V\u2207 (Mb )\nis actually endowed with a structure of a smooth vector bundle over B.\nOn the other hand, since each fiber Mb is a standard1 affine torus, one\ncan define for each b \u2208 B the space \u039bb \u2282 V\u2207 (Mb ) of 1-periodic parallel vector fields on Mb , which is easily shown\nS to be a lattice of V\u2207 (Mb ). Moreover,\none\nS can show that the union \u039b = b\u2208B \u039bb is a smooth lattice subbundle of\nb\u2208B V\u2207 (Mb ), called the period bundle. This is in fact the geometrical content of the Arnol'd-Mineur-Liouville Theorem\n[1, 7, 6]. To prove this, one\nS\nconstructs explicitly smooth sections of b\u2208B V\u2207 (Mb ) which are 1-periodic,\nnamely Hamiltonian vector fields X\u03be\u25e6\u03c0 whose Hamiltonian is the pullback of\na function \u03be \u2208 C \u221e (M) of a special type and called action. Now, the symplectic\nform on M provides for each b an isomorphism between V\u2207 (Mb ) and Tb\u2217 B.\nThe image of the bundle \u039b by this isomorphism is then a smooth lattice subbundle E \u2217 of T \u2217 B, called the Action bundle, and its dual E (called the Resonance\nbundle) is a smooth lattice subbundle of T B. This lattice subbundle E provides\na way to associate the tangent spaces Tb B for neighbouring points b. This thus\n1\n\nHere, \"standard\" means holonomy-free.\n\n3\n\n\fimplies the existence of a natural integer, torsion-free and flat connection \u2207\non the base space B (as discovered by Duistermaat [4]). Actually, angle-action\ncoordinates are semi-global canonical coordinates (x, \u03be) : \u03c0 \u22121 (O) \u2192 Td \u00d7 Rd ,\nwhere O is an open subset of B, with the properties that the xj 's are flat (with\nrespect to Weinstein's connection) coordinates on the tori, and the differentials\nd\u03bej are smooth sections of the Action bundle E \u2217 (this implies that the coordinates \u03bej are flat with respect to Duistermaat's connection on B).\nIn the sequel, the space of parallel vector fields will be denoted by V\u2207 (B)\nand the space of parallel 1-forms by \u03a91\u2207 (B). We mention that in general the\nholonomy of Duistermaat's connection does not vanish. As a consequence,\nthe spaces V\u2207 (B) and \u03a91\u2207 (B) might be empty. Nevertheless, when one works\nlocally in a simply connected subset O \u2282 B, the spaces of local parallel sections\nV\u2207 (O) and \u03a91\u2207 (O) are d-dimensional vector spaces.\n\n2 Different nondegeneracy conditions\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nLet H, M \u2192 B be a regular CI system composed of a fibration in lagrangian\n\u03c0\n\ntori M \u2192 B together with a Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M) constant along the\nfibers. As mentionned before, H is of the form H = F \u25e6 \u03c0, with F \u2208 C \u221e (B). It\nturns out that all the nondegeneracy conditions are expressed in terms of the\nfunction F and Duistermaat's connection \u2207 that naturally exists on B. On the\nother hand, these conditions are local : F is said to be non-degenerate if is nondegenerate at each b \u2208 B. Moreover, some of these conditions are expressed\nin terms of the space of parallel vector fields V\u2207 (B), but the local character of\nthe nondegeneracy conditions means that one needs actually only the spaces\nV\u2207 (O) of local parallel vector fields in a neighbourhood O \u2282 B of each point\nb \u2208 B. We will use a slight misuse of language and say \"for each X \u2208 V\u2207 (B)\"\ninstead of \"for each b \u2208 B, each neighbourhood O \u2282 B of b and each X \u2208\nV\u2207 (O)\".\nFor our purposes, let's define for each X \u2208 V\u2207 (B) the function \u03a9X \u2208\nC \u221e (B) by \u03a9X = dF (X) and the associated resonance set\n\u03a3X = {b \u2208 B | \u03a9X (b) = 0} .\nS\nWe will also denote by K = b Kb the integrable distibution of hyperplanes\nKb \u2282 Tb B tangent to the hypersurfaces F = cst, i.e. Kb = ker dF |b . The Hessian\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2207\u2207F , which is a (0, 2)-tensor field on B, will be denoted by F . It is symmetric since \u2207 is torsion-free. The connection \u2207 also yields an identification\nof the cotangent spaces Tb\u2217 B at neighbouring points b and allows us to define\nthe frequency map \u03c6 : B \u2192 \u03a91\u2207 (B) by \u03c6 (b) = dFb\u2207 , where dFb\u2207 \u2208 \u03a91\u2207 (B) is\nthe parallel 1-form which coincides with dF at the point b.

Condition \"Bryuno\" is equivalent to Condition \"N\".\nProof. Consider the linear maps U : Tb B \u2295 R \u2192 Tb\u2217 B and V : Tb B \u2192 Tb\u2217 B \u2295 R\nof Conditions \"Bryuno\" and \"N\". We will show that Ut = V. Indeed, for each\nX \u2208 Tb B and each (Y, \u03b1) \u2208 Tb B \u2295 R, the transposed Ut : Tb B \u2192 Tb\u2217 B \u2295 R\nverifies :\nUt (X) (Y, \u03b1) = U (Y, \u03b1) (X)\n\u2032\u2032\n\n= F (Y, X) + \u03b1dF (X)\n\u2032\u2032\n\n= F (X, Y ) + \u03b1dF (X) ,\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere the symmetry of F has been used. Therefore, one has\nUt (X) (Y, \u03b1) = V (X) (Y, \u03b1) .\n\u0001\nThis implies that rank (V) = rank Ut = rank (U) and thus that Conditions\n\"N\" and \"Bryuno\" are equivalent.\nProposition 2. Condition \"Bryuno\" is equivalent to Condition \"Turning frequencies\".\nProof. Let dFb\u2207 = \u03c6 (b) be the parallel 1-form which coincides with dF at the\npoint b. Condition \"TF\" (\"Turning frequencies\")\nmeans that the derivative\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n(\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217 of the map \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 : B \u2192 P \u03a9\u2207 (B) is surjective. Since P \u03a91\u2207 (B)\nis (d \u2212 1)-dimensionnal, Condition \"TF\" means that the kernel of (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217 is\n1-dimensionnal. Now, the kernel of (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217 is precisely the space of X such\nthat \u03c6\u2217 (X) is in the kernel of \u03c0\u2217 , i.e. tangent to the fibers \u03c0 \u22121 . Using\n\u0001 the\nnatural isomorphism between \u03a91\u2207 (B) and its tangent space T \u03a91\u2207 (B) , one\neasily sees that ker (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217 is composed of the vectors X such that \u03c6\u2217 Xb \u221d\n\u03c6 (b). Condition \"TF\" is thus equivalent to requiring that if Xb and Yb satisfy\n\u03c6\u2217 Xb \u221d \u03c6 (b) and \u03c6\u2217 Yb \u221d \u03c6 (b), then Xb \u221d Yb .\nOn the other hand, we show that \u03c6\u2217 Xb = \u2207Xb \u2207F . Indeed, let t \u2192 b (t)\nbe a geodesic t \u2192 b (t), passing through b at t = 0, and let Xb the tangent\nvector of b (t) at b. In a neigbourhood of b, one can extend Xb in a unique\n7\n\n\fway to a parallel vector field X. We thus have \u03c6tX (b) = b (t). We want to\nd\n\u2207 is\n(\u03c6 (b (t)))t=0 . By definition, for each t, \u03c6 (b (t)) = dFb(t)\ncalculate \u03c6\u2217 Xb = dt\nthe parallel 1-form which coincides with dFb(t) at the point b (t). It is invariant\nby the flow of any parallel vector field, and thus by the one of X, i.e.\n\u0001\u2217 \u0010 \u2207 \u0011\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\ndFb(t)\n(\u03c6 (b (t)))b = \u03c6tX\n= \u03c6tX dF b .\nb(t)\n\nUsing the definition of the Lie derivative, one obtains \u03c6\u2217 Xb = (LX (dF ))b . The\nCartan's magic formula then gives \u03c6\u2217 Xb = d (dF (X))b . Finally, since X is\nparallel, we find that \u03c6\u2217 Xb = (\u2207X \u2207F )b .\nTogether with the previous result, we have thus proved that is Xb and Xb\nsatisfy (\u2207Xb \u2207F )b \u221d dFb et (\u2207Yb \u2207F )b \u221d dFb , then they must be linearly dependent. This is precisely Condition \"Bryuno\".\n\nProposition 3. Condition \"N\" is equivalent to Condition \"Regular resonant set\".\nProof. Indeed, for each X \u2208 V\u2207 (B), one has \u03a9X = \u2207X F and thus d (\u03a9X ) =\n\u2207\u2207X F = \u2207X \u2207F . Conditions \"\"Regular resonant set\" thus reads\n\u2200X \u2208 V\u2207 (B) , \u2200b with X \u2208 Kb =\u21d2 (\u2207X \u2207F )b 6= 0.\nThis is equivalent to\n\u2200b, \u2200X \u2208 Kb =\u21d2 (\u2207X \u2207F )b 6= 0,\ni.e. precisely Condition \"N\".\nProposition 4. Condition \"Iso-energetic\" is equivalent to Condition \"Iso-energetic\nturning frequencies\".\nProof. Condition \"Iso-energetic turning frequencies\" amounts to requiring that\nat each point b the map (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217 restricted to an energy\nlevel SE = F \u22121 (E) is a\n\u0001\nisomorphism between Tb SE and T\u03c0(\u03c6(b)) P \u03a91\u2207 (B) , i.e. the kernel of (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6)\u2217\nis transverse to SE . Arguing as is the proof of Proposition 2, this is equivalent\nto requiring that if Xb verifies (\u2207Xb \u2207H)b \u221d dHb , then Xb must be transverse\nto SE , i.e. dF (Xb ) 6= 0, which is precisely Condition \"Iso-energetic\".\nProposition 5. Condition \"Russmann\" is equivalent to Condition \"Resonant set\nwith empy interior\".\nProof. By definition of the frequency map \u03c6, for each X \u2208 V\u2207 (B), one has\n\u03c6 (b) (X) = dFb\u2207 (X). Since both X and dFb\u2207 are parallel, the contraction\ndFb\u2207 (X) is a constant function on B and thus equals to its value, e.g. at the\npoint b which is nothing but dFb (X) = \u03a9X (b). We thus have \u03c6 (.) (X) =\n\u03a9X (.). Now, \u03c6 (b) annihilates X on an open subset iff the resonant set \u03a3X =\n\u03a9\u22121\nX (0) contains this open subset, and therefore its interior is not empty.\n\n8\n\n\f3.2 Stronger and weaker conditions\nProposition 6. Condition \"Iso-energetic\" implies Condition \"Weak\".\nProof. Condition \"Iso-energetic\" means that for each X \u2208 Kb , the 1-form \u2207X \u2207F |Kb\nis non-vanishing. This property remains true whithout the restriction to Kb , i.e.\nX \u2208 Kb =\u21d2 \u2207X \u2207F 6= 0,\nwhich is Condition \"N\".\nProposition 7. Condition \"Kolmogorov\" implies Condition \"Weak\".\nProof. Condition \"Kolmogorov\" means that for each X \u2208 Tb B, one has \u2207X \u2207F 6=\n0. By restriction, this remains true for each X \u2208 Kb , which is Condition\n\"N\".\nProposition 8. Condition \"Weak\" implies \"Kolmogorov or Iso-energetic\".\nProof. We will actually show the following equivalent logical statement : if\nCondition \"Weak\" is fulfilled but not Condition \"Kolmogorov\", then Condition \"Iso-energetic\" is fulfilled. Suppose that there is a vector X \u2208 Tb B such\nthat \u2207X \u2207F = 0 at b. We can then extend X around b to a parallel vector field,\n\u2032\u2032\nand thanks to the symmetry of F , one has \u2207\u2207X F = 0 at b, i.e. (d\u03a9X )b = 0.\nOn the other hand, if Condition \"Regular resonant set\" is fulfilled, this implies that b cannot belong to the resonant set \u03a3X , and thus X \u2208\n/ Kb . Moreover,\nCondition \"Bryuno\" insures that each Y satisfying \u2207X \u2207F \u221d dF at b must be\nlinearly dependent on X, i.e. Y \u221d X. We thus have showed that for each\nY \u2208 Kb satisfying \u2207Y \u2207F \u221d dF , one has Y \u221d X and therefore Y \u2208\n/ Kb . This\nimplies that Y = 0. It is precisely Condition \"Iso-energetic\".\nProposition 9. Condition \"Weak\" implies Condition \"R\u00fcssmann\".\nProof. Indeed, Condition \"Regular resonant set\" implies that for each nonvanishing parallel vector field X \u2208 V\u2207 (B), the resonant set \u03a3X is a 1-codimensional\nsubmanifold, and thus has an empty interior.\n\n3.3 Examples\nExample. \"Kolmogorov\" and \"Iso-energetic\".\nOn B = Rd \\ 0, consider the\nPd\n2\n2\n2\n1\nfunction F (\u03be) = 2 |\u03be| , where |\u03be| =\nj=1 (\u03bej ) . The differential is dF =\nPd\nj=1 \u03bej d\u03bej and the Hessian Fij (\u03be) = \u03b4ij is the identity matrix at each point \u03be.\n. Therefore, one has det (Fij ) = 1 , which means that F actually satisfies Condition \"Kolmogorov\" on Rd .

On B = R+ \u00d7 R, consider\n\u03be3\n\u03be2\nthe function F (\u03be) = 31 + 22 .

This means that Condition \"Iso-energetic\" is not satisfied on\nthis curve.\n\nExample. \"R\u00fcssmann\" but not \"Weak\". On B = R2 \\ 0, let us consider the\nfunction F (\u03be) = \u03be14 +\u03be24 . The differential is dF = 4\u03be13 d\u03be1 +4\u03be23 d\u03be2 , implying that\nfor each X \u2208 R2 ,\bone has \u03a9X = dF (X) = 4\u03be13 X1 + 4\u03be23 X2 . The associated resonant set \u03a3X = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) | \u03be13 X1 + \u03be23 X2 = 0 is simply a line passing through\n10\n\n\f\u0010 \u00111\n3\n1\nthe origine and with slope equal to \u2212 X\n, without the origin point. This set\nX2\nhas an empty interior and therefore Condition \"R\u00fcssmann\" is satisfied. On the\n\u0001\nother hand, the differential of \u03a9X is given by d\u03a9X = 12 \u03be12 X1 d\u03be1 + \u03be22 X2 d\u03be2 .\nWe can see that for some vectors X, the differential d\u03a9X vanishes at some\npoints belonging to the \u03a3X , and thus Condition \"Weak\" is not satisfied. For example, for X = (X1 , 0) the resonant set \u03a3X is the vertical axis {(0, \u03be2 ) ; \u03be2 6= 0}\nwithout the origin point. Now, at each point of this set, one has d\u03a9X = 0.\n\n4 Somes properties of ND hamiltonians\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nLet H, M \u2192 B be a regular CI system composed of a fibration in lagrangian\n\u03c0\n\ntori M \u2192 B together with a Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M) constant along the\nfibers, i.e. H = F \u25e6 \u03c0 for some F \u2208 C \u221e (B). As explained in Section 1, such a\nfibration implies the existence of a natural torsion-free and flat connection on\nthe base space B, the Duistermaat connection. Moreover, one can easily show\nthat the Hamiltonian vector field XH associated with H = F \u25e6 \u03c0 is tangent to\nthe fibration and its restriction to each torus Mb is an element of V\u2207 (Mb ), i.e.\nis parallel with respect to Weintein's connection. Therefore, on each torus, XH\ngenerates a linear dynamics that can be periodic, resonant or non-resonant.\nThe resonance properties are actually well-parametrized by using the Resonance bundle E. Indeed, for any given k \u2208 \u0393 (E), the previously defined set\n\u03a3k = \u03a9\u22121\nk (0), with \u03a9k = dF (k), is actually the set of tori on which the Hamiltonian\nvector\nfield XH satisfies at least one resonance relation which reads\nPd\nj = 0 in action-angle coordinates. On such tori, the dynamics is\nk\nX\nj=1 i\nactually confined in (d \u2212 1)-dimensionnal subtori. If the dynamics of XH is\nperiodic on a torus Mb , this means that it satisfies d \u2212 1 resonance relations,\ni.e. b belongs to the intersection of resonant sets \u03a3k1 , ..., \u03a3kd\u22121 , where the kj are\nlinearly independent sections of \u0393 (E). On the other hand, if XH is ergodic on\nsome torus Mb , this means that b does not belong to any resonant set.\nLemma 10. If F \u2208 C \u221e (B) is \"R\u00fcssmann\" non-degenerate, then the set of tori on\nwhich the dynamics is ergodic is dense in B.\n\nProof. If Mb is an ergodic torus,\nthis means that b does not\nS\nSbelong to any res.\nWe\nwill\nshow\nthat\nB\n\\\nonant set \u03a3k , i.e. b \u2208 B \\ k \u03a3S\nk\nk \u03a3k is dense in B\nby showing that the interior of k \u03a3k is empty. Indeed, whenever the function\nF satisfies Condition \"R\u00fcssmann\", then for each non-vanishing k \u2208 \u0393 (E), the\nsubset \u03a3k has empty interior. Moreover, \u03a3k is a closed subset since it is the\ninverse image of the point 0 \u2208 R by the continuous map dF (k) : B \u2192 R.\nS We\ncan then apply the Baire's Theorem (see for e.g. [3]) which insures that k \u03a3k\nhas empty interior.\nLemma 11. If the Hamiltonian H = F \u25e6 \u03c0 is \"R\u00fcssmann\" non-degenerate, then the\nspace of functions C \u221e (M) constant along the fibers equals to the space of functions\nC \u221e (M) which Poisson-commute with H.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. Indeed, if a function A \u2208 C \u221e (M) satisfies {H, A} = 0, then one has\nXH (A) = 0 and therefore A is constant along the trajectories of XH . For each\ntorus Mb on which the dynamics is ergodic, this implies that A is constant over\nthis torus. Now, Lemma 10 insures that when H satisfies Condition \"R\u00fcssmann\", then the set of ergodic tori is dense in B. By continuity, this shows that\nF is constant along all the fibers Mb . Conversely, if F is constant along all the\nfibers, then {H, F } = XH (F ) = 0 since XH is tangent to the fibration.\nCorollary 12. Let H = F \u25e6 \u03c0 be a \"R\u00fcssmann\" non-degenerate Hamiltonian and\nA, B \u2208 C \u221e (M) two functions. Then, the following holds\n{A, H} = {B, H} = 0 \u21d2 {A, B} = 0.\nProof. Indeed, if A and B commute with H, Lemma 11 implies that A and B\nare constant along the fibers. Moreover, since the fibers are lagrangian, XA is\ntangent to them and therefore {A, B} = XA (B) = 0.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nTheorem 13. If H, M \u2192 B is a \"R\u00fcssmann\" non-degenerate C.I system, then\n\u03c0\n\nM \u2192 B is the unique fibration such that H is constant along the fibers.\n\u03c0\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nProof. Indeed, suppose M \u2192 B is another\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011 fibration such that H is constant\nalong the fibers. Let a1 , ..., ad \u2208 C \u221e B be a local coordinate system in an\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nopen subset O \u2282 B and Aj = aj \u25e6 \u03c0 , j = 1..d, the pull-back functions. Since\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011\u22121\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\nthe differentials dAj are linearly independent in \u03c0 \u22121 O , the fibers \u03c0\nare given by the level-sets of the Aj 's. Moreover, we have {Aj , H} = 0 since\n\u2032\nby hypothesis H is constant along the lagrangian fibration \u03c0 . Now, Lemma 11\nimplies that the functions Aj must be constant along the fibers of the first fibration \u03c0, since H is non-degenerate. This means that the fibers \u03c0 \u22121 are included\n\u2032\nin the level sets of the Aj 's, and thus are included in the fibers of \u03c0 . Since the\nfibers of both fibrations have the same dimension, they must coincide.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.I. Arnol'd. A theorem of Liouville concerning integrable dynamics.\nSiberian Math.
