The normal form of\nthe dynamical system has periodic solutions for a large set of initial conditions.\nThis implies that an initially expanding closed isotropic universe may exhibit\noscillatory behavior.\n\nIn this paper we investigate the late time evolution of positively curved FRW\nmodels with a perfect fluid in the R + \u03b2R2 theory. The simple vacuum case was\nstudied in [1], where oscillatory behavior of the solutions of closed models was found.\nSince there is no universally acceptable answer to the issue \"which conformal frame\nis physical\", (see for example [2]), it should be interesting to compare the solution\nin the Jordan frame with the solution of the same problem obtained in the Einstein\nframe. In the following, we confine our attention to cosmologies with a perfect fluid\nwith energy density \u03c1 and pressure p, of the form p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1, 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 2.\nWe begin our study in the Einstein frame. The scalar field is minimally coupled\nto ordinary matter. The Einstein equations reduce to the constraint\n3H 2 +\n\n3k\n1\n= \u03c1 + \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6) ,\n2\na\n2\n\nand the evolution equations\n\u03b3\nk\n1\n\u1e22 = \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 \u03c1 + 2 ,\n3\n2\na\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u22123\u03b3\u03c1H, \u03c6\u0308 + 3 \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0,\na\n\u0227 = aH,\n\nwhere the potential takes the form\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u00112\n\u221a\n1 \u0010\n1 \u2212 e\u2212 2/3\u03c6 .\n8\u03b2\n1\n\n\fWe use the constraint to eliminate a, rescale the variables and set \u03c6\u0307 =: y, u := e\u2212\u03c6 ,\nto obtain the quadratic system\n\u1e8f = \u2212u + u2 \u2212 3Hy,\n1\n1\n3\u03b3 \u2212 2\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u22123\u03b3\u03c1H,\n\u1e22 = (1 \u2212 u)2 \u2212 y 2 \u2212\n\u03c1 \u2212 H 2.\n4\n2\n6\n\nu\u0307 = \u2212uy,\n\nThere are two equilibria,q\nS, corresponding to the de Sitter universe with a cos1\nand M, corresponding to the limiting state of an\nmological constant equal to 8\u03b2\never-expanding universe with H \u2192 0 while the scalar field approaches the minimum\nof the potential and the scale factor goes to infinity.\nTheorem 1 The equilibrium point S is locally asymptotically unstable.\nSketch of the proof. We apply the center manifold theorem, according to which\nthe qualitative behavior in a neighborhood of a nonhyperbolic equilibrium point q\nis determined by its behavior on the center manifold near q. We compute the center\nmanifold and find the restriction of the dynamical system on it; it turns out that S\nis unstable.\nM is totally degenerate. Applying the normal form theory, one may show that\nan initially expanding closed universe near M cannot avoid recollapse for 23 < \u03b3 \u2264 2,\nsee [3] for details.\nNext we return to the Jordan frame. With x = 1/a, the 0 \u2212 0 equation becomes\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1\nR2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n= \u03c1,\nH + kx + 2\u03b2 R H + kx + H \u1e58 \u2212\n12\n3\nand the evolution (fourth-order) equations are\n1\n\u1e22 = R \u2212 2H 2 \u2212 kx2 ,\n6\n1\n1\nR=\n(4 \u2212 3\u03b3) \u03c1.\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u22123\u03b3\u03c1H, R\u0308 + 3H \u1e58 +\n6\u03b2\n6\u03b2\n\n\u1e8b = \u2212xH,\n\nThe state of the system is (R, \u1e58, x, \u03c1, H) \u2208 R5 . We use the constraint to eliminate\n\u03c1, so we obtain a four-dimensional system.\nThere are two equilibria: S corresponding to the Einstein static universe, where\nthe effective cosmological constant is provided by the curvature equilibrium\nkx\u03042 +\n\n\u039b\n1\n= \u03c1\u0304, \u039b > 0.\n3\n3\n\nS is unstable (the local stable and unstable manifolds through S are both twodimensional).\nThe other equilibrium point is the origin (0, 0, 0, 0). Linearization shows that\nthe eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at the origin are \u00b1i, 0, 0. The normal form\nof the system near (0, 0, 0, 0) in cylindrical coordinates is\n2\n\n\f3\n\u1e59 = \u2212 ry,\n2\n\u1e8b = \u2212xy,\n\n\u03b8\u0307 = 1,\n\n(1)\n\n\u1e8f = 6 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) r 2 \u2212\n\n3\u03b3 \u2212 2 2 3\u03b3 2\nx \u2212 y .\n2\n2\n\nWe write the first and third equations as a differential equation\ndr\n3r\n=\ndx\n2x\n\n\u21d2 r = Ax3/2 , A > 0.\n\nSubstitution into the fourth equation of (1) yields the projection of the fourthdimensional system on the x \u2212 y plane, namely\n\u1e8b = \u2212xy,\n\n\u1e8f = b (\u03b3 \u2212 1) x3 \u2212\n\n3\u03b3 \u2212 2 2 3\u03b3 2\nx \u2212 y ,\n2\n2\n\nb > 0.\n\nWe note that: Trajectories are symmetric with respect to the x axis, the line x = 0\nis invariant, and the system has a first integral,\n\u03c6 (x, y) = \u2212\n\n2b 3(1\u2212\u03b3)\ny2\nx\n+ x2\u22123\u03b3 + 3\u03b3 , \u03b3 6= 1,\n3\nx\n\n\u03c6 (x, y) =\n\n1 y2\n+ , \u03b3 = 1.\nx x3\n\nThe level curves of \u03c6 are the trajectories of the system. In [4] is proved the following\nresult.\nTheorem 2 For every \u03b3 \u2208 ( 32 , 2] there are no solutions asymptotically approaching\nthe origin (ii) for \u03b3 \u2208 ( 23 , 1] there are no periodic solutions and (iii) for \u03b3 \u2208 (1, 2]\nthere exist periodic solutions and the basin of every periodic trajectory is the set\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2b 3\n2\n2\n2\n(x, y) \u2208 R : y + x \u2212 x < 0, x > 0 .\n3\nObviously we cannot assign a physical meaning to the new variables (r, \u03b8, x, y),\nsince the transformations involved in the normal form have \"mixed\" the original\nvariables in a nontrivial way. However, the periodic character of the solutions whatever the physical meaning of the variables be, has the following interpretation. Close\nto the equilibrium of the original system, there exist periodic solutions.\nThis feature is not revealed in the Einstein frame, possibly because, the scalar\nfield related to the conformal transformation is not coupled to matter, i.e., the\nmatter Lagrangian is added after performing the conformal transformation.\nIn a recent work [5], we consider a scalar field having an arbitrary, bounded\nfrom below potential function V (\u03c6) , nonminimally coupled to matter. For flat and\nnegatively curved FRW models, our preliminary results indicate that the energy\nexchange between the two matter components is such that:\nIf \u03b3 < 1 the energy density \u03c1 eventually dominates over the energy density of\nthe scalar field \u01eb and this universe follows the classical Friedmannian evolution. For\n\u03b3 > 1, \u01eb eventually dominates over \u03c1.\n3\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J. Miritzis, in Proc. MG11, p. 2048, H. Kleinert, R. T. Jantzen and R.
