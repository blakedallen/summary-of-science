Such metamaterial\nmodels provide a table top realization of metric signature change events suggested\nto occur in Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum gravity theories.\n\nPACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 42.25.Bs, 71.36.+c, 78.30.-j.\n\nThe unprecedented degree of control of the local dielectric permittivity \u03b5ik and magnetic\npermeability \u03bcik tensors in electromagnetic metamaterials has fueled recent explosion in\nnovel device ideas, and resulted in discovery of new physical phenomena. Advances in\nexperimental design and theoretical understanding of metamaterials greatly benefited\nfrom the field theoretical ideas developed to describe physics in curvilinear space-time.\nElectromagnetic cloaking [1,2,3] and electromagnetic wormholes [4] may be cited as\ngood examples. With the new found freedom of \u03b5ik and \u03bcik manipulation,\n\n\f2\n\nexperimentalists may create optical models of virtually any metric allowed in general\nrelativity [5]. Recent literature [6-9] provides good examples of how it is being achieved\nin the case of optical analogues of black holes. On the other hand, compared to standard\ngeneral relativity, metamaterial optics gives more freedom to design an effective spacetime with very unusual properties. Light propagation in all static general relativity\nsituations can be mimicked with positive \u03b5ik = \u03bcik [10], while the allowed parameter\nspace of the metamaterial optics is broader. Thus, the flat Minkowski space-time with\nthe usual (-,+,+,+) signature does not need to be a starting point. Other effective\nsignatures, such as the \"two times\" (2T) physics (-,-,+,+) signature may be realized [11].\nTheoretical investigation of the 2T higher dimensional space-time models had been\npioneered by Paul Dirac [12]. More recent examples can be found in [13,14]. Metric\nsignature change events (in which a phase transition occurs between say (-,+,+,+) and\n(-,-,+,+) space-time signature) are being studied in Bose-Einstein condensates and in\nsome modified gravitation theories (see ref.[15], and the references therein). In general,\nit is predicted that a quantum field theory residing on a spacetime undergoing a\nsignature change reacts violently to the imposition of the signature change. Both the\ntotal number and the total energy of the particles generated in a signature change event\nare formally infinite [15]. Therefore, such a metric signature transition can be called a\n\"Big Flash\", which shares some similarities with the cosmological \"Big Bang\". A\nmetamaterial model of a metric signature change event should be extremely interesting\nto observe. Unlike usual phase transitions, in which the physical system changes while\nthe background metric is intact, the signature change transition affects the underlying\nbackground metric experienced by the system. Therefore, signature change events\nconstitute a new kind of phase transition.\n\n\f3\n\nThe equation of motion of a quantum scalar field \u03c6 residing on some space-time\nis described by the Klein-Gordon equation [16]:\n\nP\u02c6 i P\u02c6i\u03c6 = m 2\u03c6\n\n(1)\n\ni\nwhere P\u02c6 = \u2202 / \u2202xi is the momentum operator. For a massless field in a \"flat\" (2+2)\n\nfour-dimensional 2T space-time the Klein-Gordon equation can be written as\n2\n2\n2\n\u239b \u22022\n\u239e\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u239c 2 + 2 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u239f\u03c6 = 0\n\u239c \u2202x\n\u239f\n\u239d 1 \u2202x2 \u2202x3 \u2202x4 \u23a0\n\n(2)\n\nin the coordinate space, and as\n\n(\u2212 k\n\n2\n1\n\n)\n\n\u2212 k 22 + k32 + k 42 \u03c6 k = 0\n\n(3)\n\nin the k-space. To illustrate how dynamics described by eq.(2) can be mimicked in\nmetamaterials, let us start with a non-dispersive (if the operating bandwidth is\nsufficiently narrow the dispersion can be neglected) and non-magnetic uniaxial\nanisotropic material with dielectric permittivities \u03b5x= \u03b5y= \u03b51 and \u03b5z = \u03b52. The wave\nequation in such a material can be written ([17]) as\n\nr\n\u2202 2 E t \u22121 r r r\n\u2212 2 2 = \u03b5 \u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 E\nc \u2202t\n\nt \u22121\n\nwhere \u03b5\n\n(4)\n\nis the inverse dielectric permittivity tensor calculated at the center frequency\n\nof the signal bandwidth. Any electromagnetic field propagating in this material can be\nexpressed as a sum of the \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" contributions, each of these\n\nr\n\nbeing a sum of an arbitrary number of plane waves polarized in the \"ordinary\" ( E\n\nr\n\nperpendicular to the optical axis) and \"extraordinary\" ( E parallel to the plane defined\nby the k\u2013vector of the wave and the optical axis) directions. Let us defined our \"scalar\"\nextraordinary wave function as \u03c6 =Ez (so that the ordinary portion of the\n\n\f4\n\nelectromagnetic field does not contribute to \u03c6). Equation (4) then yields the following\nform of the wave equation:\n\n\u2202 2\u03c6\n\u2202 2\u03c6\n1 \u239b \u2202 2\u03c6 \u2202 2\u03c6 \u239e\n\u239f\n\u239c\n=\n+\n+\nc 2 \u2202t 2 \u03b5 1\u2202z 2 \u03b5 2 \u239c\u239d \u2202x 2 \u2202y 2 \u239f\u23a0\n\n(5)\n\nWhile in ordinary crystalline anisotropic media both \u03b51 and \u03b52 are positive, this is not\nnecessarily the case in metamaterials. In the indefinite metamaterials considered for\nexample in [18,19] \u03b51 and \u03b52 have opposite signs. These metamaterials are typically\ncomposed of multilayer metal-dielectric or metal wire array structures, as shown in\nFig.1(a). Optical properties of such metamaterials are quite unusual. For example, there\nis no usual diffraction limit in an indefinite metamaterial [18-23]. In the absence of\ndispersion, eq.(5) in the case of \u03b51 <0 and \u03b52 >0 looks like the Klein-Gordon equation\n(2) for a massless field in a \"flat\" (2+2) four-dimensional 2T space-time.\nHowever, metamaterials generally show high dispersion, which often cannot be\nneglected. In this case eq.(4) is replaced by:\n\n\u03c92 r\nc2\n\nr r r\nr\nt r\nD\u03c9 = \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 E\u03c9 and D\u03c9 = \u03b5 \u03c9 E\u03c9\n\n(6)\n\nwhich results in the following wave equation for \u03c6\u03c9 :\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c92\nc2\n\n\u03c6\u03c9 =\n\n\u2202 2\u03c6\u03c9 1 \u239b \u2202 2\u03c6\u03c9 \u2202 2\u03c6\u03c9\n+ \u239c\n+\n\u2202y 2\n\u03b5 1\u2202z 2 \u03b5 2 \u239c\u239d \u2202x 2\n\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n(7)\n\nor equivalently in the k-space:\n\n\u03c92\nc2\n\n\u03c6\u03c9 , k =\n\nk z2\n\n\u03b51\n\n\u03c6\u03c9 , k +\n\nk x2 + k y2\n\n\u03b52\n\n\u03c6\u03c9 , k\n\n(8)\n\nLet us consider the case of \u03b51 <0 and \u03b52 >0 and assume that this behavior holds in some\nfrequency range. Here we observe that the effective space-time signature as seen by\n\n\f5\n\nextraordinary light propagating inside the metamaterial has different character\ndepending on the frequency. At high frequencies (above the plasma frequency of the\nmetal), the metamaterial exhibits \"normal\" Minkowski effective metric with (-,+,+,+)\nsignature, while at low frequencies the metric signature changes to (-,-,+,+). After\nsimple coordinate transformation eq.(8) can be re-written as\n\n(\u2212 k\n\n2\nt\n\n)\n\n\u2212 k z2 + k x2 + k y2 \u03c6\u03c9 ,k = 0\n\n(9)\n\nwhich coincides with the Klein-Gordon equation for a (2+2) space-time in the k-space\n(see eq.(3)). Alternatively, in the case of \u03b51 >0 and \u03b52 <0, eq.(8) can be re-written as\n\n(k\n\n2\nt\n\n)\n\n+ k x2 + k y2 \u2212 k z2 \u03c6\u03c9 ,k = 0\n\n(10)\n\nAs a result, both at the small and the large frequencies the effective metric looks like the\nMinkowski space-time. However, at small frequencies the z-coordinate assumes the role\nof a time-like variable. Note that causality and the form of eqs.(9) and (10) place\nstringent limits on the material losses and dispersion of hyperbolic metamaterials: a\ndispersionless and lossless hyperbolic metamaterial would violate causality. On the\nother hand, such metamaterials indeed enable experimental exploration of the metric\nsignature transitions [15] to and from the Minkowski space-time. Unlike the infinite\nnumber of particles created in an idealized theoretical signature change event [15],\nmetamaterial losses limit the number of particles created during the real signature\nchange transition. Nevertheless, our calculations indicate that the number of created\nparticles is still very large (see Fig.3).\nA composite metamaterial, which exhibits a metric signature phase transition as\na function of temperature can be designed using materials which exhibit metal-dielectric\ntransitions. A numerical example of such a metamaterial is presented in Fig.1. It is\nmaking use of a pronounced change in dielectric constant of gallium upon phase\n\n\f6\n\ntransition from the crystalline semi-metallic \u03b1-gallium phase to the liquid phase, in\nwhich gallium behaves as a low-loss free-electron metal. The melting point of gallium\nat the atmospheric pressure is located at 29.8o C [24], so the \"metric signature phase\ntransition\" in such a metamaterial is easy to observe. This transition may also be\ninduced by external femtosecond light pulses, as has been observed in [25] for gallium\nfilms on silica substrates. The wired metamaterial structure in the simulation is assumed\nto be made of thin gallium wires distributed inside the silica matrix, so that observations\nof ref.[25] can be used. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of liquid\ngallium were taken from ref.[24]. The optical constants of solid \u03b1-gallium were taken\nfrom [26]. The Maxwell-Garnett approximation has been used to calculate the real and\nimaginary parts of \u03b5z and \u03b5x,y of the \"wired\" metamaterial for the liquid and solid states\nof the gallium wires (Fig.1(b,c)). It has been validated in [19] in the case of low volume\nfraction N of the metallic component of the metamaterial. Therefore, the case of\nNGa=0.1 volume fraction of gallium has been considered. It is possible to further refine\nthe Maxwell-Garnet approximation by taking into account dynamical interaction\nbetween the wires [27]. Our simulations indicate that the extraordinary photons\npropagating inside the wired Ga-based metamaterial experience the metric signature\nchange from the Minkowski-like (-,+,+,+) to the 2T physics (-,-,+,+) upon melting of\nthe Ga wires. Moreover, the losses in the (-,-,+,+) regime remain relatively low: at 1.8\neV the ratio of real to imaginary part of \u03b5z is about Re(\u03b5z)/Im(\u03b5z)~2, which is translated\ninto about factor of 4 ratio between the real and imaginary parts of the photon\nwavevector. In principle, propagation loss may be further improved by using a gain\nmedium such as the dye-doped silica instead of passive silica glass [28]. We also note\nthat the \"layered\" Ga-based metamaterial having NGa=0.1 would also demonstrate a\n\n\f7\n\nmetric phase transition as a function of temperature. Femtosecond light-induced phase\ntransition inside such a metamaterial (which according to ref.[25] occur extremely fast)\nwould look like a version of the dynamical Casimir effect experiment [29,30], which is\npredicted to produce a \"flash\" of Casimir light emission.\nThe \"Big Flash\" behavior is not limited to the artificial metal-dielectric\nmetamaterials only. Many dielectric crystals, such as \u03b1-quartz, have lattice vibration\nmodes which carry an electric dipole moment. The dipole moment couples the lattice\nvibrations to the radiation field in the crystal to form the phonon-polariton modes [31].\nAs a result, multiple reststrahlen bands are formed near the frequencies of the dipoleactive lattice vibration modes \u03c9n (where n is the mode number) in which both \u03b51 and \u03b52\nbecome metal-like and negative. These bands are typically located in the mid-IR region\nof the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to crystal anisotropy, \u03b51 and \u03b52 change sign at\nslightly different frequencies [32]. Thus, in the narrow frequency ranges near the\nboundaries of the reststrahlen bands \u03b51 and \u03b52 have different signs. In these frequency\nranges natural crystals behave as indefinite metamaterials, and the extraordinary light\ndispersion law is either\n\nk x2 + k y2 \u2212 k z2 = \u03c9 n2 / c 2\nk z2 \u2212 k x2 \u2212 k y2 = \u03c9 n2 / c 2\n\n, or\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThe latter case corresponds formally to the free particle spectra in a (2+1) dimensional\nMinkowski space-time, in which the mass spectrum is given by the spectrum \u03c9n of the\nlattice vibrations (Fig.2). It is interesting to note that the liquid-solid phase transition in\nsuch a crystal provides us with an example of a phase transition in which a formal (2+1)\ndimensional Minkowski space-time emerges together with a discrete free particle\n\n\f8\n\nspectrum. The characteristic feature of this phase transition appears to be a \"Big Flash\"\ndue to the sudden emergence of the infinities of the photonic density of states near the\n\n\u03c9n frequencies. Unlike the usual finite black body photonic density of states\n\ndn\n\u03c92\n=\nd\u03c9 2\u03c0 2 c 3\n\n(13)\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndefined by the usual k x + k y + k z = \u03c9 n / c photon dispersion law in vacuum, the\n\ndensity of states of the extraordinary photons near the \u03c9n frequencies diverges in the\nlossless continuous hyperbolic medium limit:\n\ndn K 3 max \u03b5 2 \u239b 1 d\u03b5 1 1 d\u03b5 2 \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u2248\n\u2212\nd\u03c9 12\u03c0 2 \u03b5 1 \u239c\u239d \u03b5 1 d\u03c9 \u03b5 2 d\u03c9 \u239f\u23a0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Kmax is the momentum cutoff [33]. Kmax is defined by either metamaterial\nstructure scale, or by losses. As a result of the suddenly emerging divergences in the\nphotonic density of states near the \u03c9n frequencies, these states are quickly populated\nduring the liquid-solid phase transition. This event can be considered as a simultaneous\nemergence of the (2+1) dimensional Minkowski space-time and a very large number of\nparticles (extraordinary photons), which quickly populate the divergent density of states,\nand hence the emergent (2+1) Minkowski space-time itself. The number of photons\ncreated as a result of such event is defined by the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution at\nthe\n\ntemperature\n\nT\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nliquid-solid\n\ntransition:\n\nN ~ (dn / d\u03c9 ) exp(\u2212h\u03c9 n / kT ) ~ K 3 max exp(\u2212h\u03c9 n / kT ) . Since for the reststrahlen bands\nh\u03c9 n \u2264 kT , a large number of photons is created. Intriguingly, flashes of light are indeed\n\nobserved during fast crystallization of many dielectric materials, which exhibit phononpolariton\n\nresonances.\n\nThis\n\nphenomenon\n\nis\n\nknown\n\nsince\n\n18th\n\ncentury\n\nas\n\ncrystalloluminescence [34]. Unfortunately, these observations may only be treated as\n\n\f9\n\nthe \"Big Flash\" events if similar flashes are observed in the mid IR range, or some\nmechanism of photon up-conversion will be confirmed.\nOn the other hand, in the case of h\u03c9 n >> kT where \u03c9n is the frequency within\nthe hyperbolic region of the dispersion law, the number of photons emitted during the\nmetric signature change transition can be calculated via the dynamical Casimir effect.\nThe total energy E of emitted photons from a phase changing volume V depends on the\nphoton dispersion laws \u03c9(k) in both media (see eq.(3) from ref.[30]):\n\nr\nE\nd 3k \u239b 1\n1\n\u239e\nh\u03c91 (k ) \u2212 h\u03c92 (k ) \u239f\n=\u222b\n3\u239c\nV\n2\n(2\u03c0 ) \u239d 2\n\u23a0\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c91(k) and \u03c92(k) are the photon dispersion relations inside the respective media.\nEquation (15) is valid in the \"sudden change\" approximation, in which the dispersion\nlaw is assumed to change instantaneously. The detailed discussion of the validity of this\napproximation can be found in ref. [30]. Therefore, the number of photons per\nfrequency interval emitted during the transition can be written as\n\ndN 1 \u239b dn1 dn2 \u239e\n= \u239c\n\u2212\n\u239f\nVd\u03c9 2 \u239d d\u03c9 d\u03c9 \u23a0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere dni/d\u03c9 are the photonic densities of states inside the respective media. Since the\nphotonic density of states diverges in the hyperbolic regions of the photon dispersion\nnear the frequencies \u03c9n of the phonon-polariton resonances, the number of photons\nemitted during the transition would also diverge near \u03c9n in the lossless continuous\nmedium limit, leading to the \"Big Flash\" behavior. Using eqs.(15,16) we can calculate\nthe number of photons emitted during the metric signature phase transition in the\ngallium-based metamaterial presented in Fig.1, assuming that it is induced by a\nfemtosecond light pulse [25], so that the \"sudden change\" approximation is valid.\n\n\f10\n\nResults of our numerical calculations of the photon energy dE/d\u03c9 (normalized per unit\nvolume) emitted during the light-induced metric signature phase transition in the\ngallium-based metamaterial from Fig.1 are presented in Fig.3. The metamaterial\nstructure in these calculations is assumed to be fine enough, so that the value of Kmax is\ndefined by metamaterial losses. Thus, a dedicated experiment performed on an artificial\nor natural hyperbolic metamaterial exhibiting a metric signature phase transition is\npossible, and would be an extremely interesting development. In addition to Ga-based\nmetamaterial geometry described above, such materials as vanadium oxide or other\nconducting transparent oxides materials (e.g. ITO, AZO and similar [35,36]) can be\nused as the phase-changing component of the hyperbolic metamaterial. These materials\ncan be switched from dielectric to metal phase by injecting more free charge careers,\nand thus changing the plasma frequency either optically or electrically.\nReferences\n\n[1] J.
