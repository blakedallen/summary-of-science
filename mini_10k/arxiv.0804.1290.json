The first ingredient is the vertical and latitudinal differential rotation that succeeds at generating a\nlarge-scale toroidal magnetic field from an initial poloidal\nfield. The second ingredient is still a matter of debate, with\nmodels invoking either the cyclonic convection in the convection zone (Parker 1955) or the transport of decaying active regions by meridional circulation (Dikpati et al. 2004)\nas possible processes to regenerate the poloidal magnetic\ncomponent. When acting together, both effects succeed at\nbuilding continuously a large-scale magnetic field that oscil-\n\nlates with time, giving rise to the 22 yr period of the solar\ncycle. Despite considerable progress in this field since the\nvery first solar dynamo model proposed by Parker (1955),\nthere are still many aspects of solar magnetism that the current models cannot reproduce or did not thoroughly explore\n(see, e.g., the reviews of Ossendrijver 2003 or Brandenburg\n& Subramanian 2005).\nOur understanding of the solar dynamo can benefit from\nthe observation of solar-type stars, where dynamo types\nmarginal or inactive in the Sun can be observed, either because these analogues of the Sun are caught by chance in an\nunfrequented activity state or because their physical properties (in particular their mass and rotation rate) differ sufficiently from the Sun's to lead to a different dynamo output.\n\n\f2\n\nP. Petit et al.\n\nChromospheric emission, observed on stars possessing an extended convective envelope, has been monitored for decades\nas an indirect tracer of stellar magnetism (e.g. Baliunas et\nal., 1995) and offered a first opportunity to investigate the\nsolar-stellar connexion. A variety of behaviours are observed,\nfrom erratic variations (common in young solar analogues)\nto smooth cycles (which seem typical of older stars like the\nSun). Yet, the total chromospheric flux provides little information about the spatial organization of the magnetic\nfield at the stellar surface, the key observable to collect for a\ncomparison with magnetic geometries predicted by dynamo\nmodels.\nAny useful effort at drawing a solar-stellar connexion\nfrom direct magnetic field measurements needs to address\nthe case of solar twins, i.e. objects with stellar parameters\nvery close to the Sun's, including a similar level of magnetic\nactivity. Despite the strong scientific motivation, measuring\na magnetic field on a strict twin of our Sun has always failed\nso far. Although being successful on a few objects quite different from the Sun by their mass (Valenti et al. 1996, Reiners & Basri 2007) or rotation rate (R\u00fcedi et al. 1997, Donati\net al. 2003, Petit et al. 2005), measurements of Zeeman signatures have always failed at detecting the magnetic field of\nlow-activity solar twins, for well-identified reasons.\nA first option at our disposal, consisting in measuring\nthe magnetic broadening of spectral lines (Saar 1988) is sensitive to the total photospheric magnetic flux but is plagued\nby the small fraction of the photosphere covered by strong\nmagnetic fields. A second option consists in analyzing circularly polarized signatures inside line profiles (Donati et al.\n1997) to recover information on the line-of-sight component\nof the magnetic vector. This second strategy suffers from the\ncomplex magnetic topology of cool stars, featuring a mixture\nof opposite polarities on the visible hemisphere, so that their\nrespective polarized signatures cancel out whenever the rotational broadening is not sufficiently large to disentangle\ntheir respective contributions. For slow-rotators, only the\nlargest-scale components of the surface field can add-up constructively to produce detectable circular polarization. On\nthe Sun, this global component of the magnetic field displays a strength limited to a few Gauss only (Babcock &\nBabcock 1955, Smith & Balogh 1995, Sanderson et al. 2003,\nMancuso & Garzelli 2007). On other low-activity stars, the\nvery tiny Zeeman signatures associated to such global fields\nhave always escaped the scrutiny of observers so far.\nWe achieve this detection in the present study, with\nthe help of spectropolarimetric data sets collected with the\nNARVAL spectropolarimeter. From a set of observations of\na sample of four Sun-like stars covering a range of rotation\nperiods, we reconstruct their large-scale photospheric magnetic geometry and discuss the impact of rotation on their\nmagnetic properties.\n\n2\n\nSTELLAR SAMPLE\n\nOur stellar sample is constituted of four nearby dwarfs.\nTheir physical parameters are chosen to be as close as possible to the Sun's, except for their rotation period (Table\n1). According to the spectral classification study of Valenti\n& Fischer (2005), all selected objects have an effective temperature compatible with the solar value within 1.3\u03c3. They\n\nalso possess a surface gravity compatible with the Sun, except HD 76151 (lying 1.8\u03c3 above the solar value). Two of\nour targets are significantly over-metallic compared to the\nSun, with HD 190771 differing from the Sun by as much as\n4.5\u03c3.\nEvolutionary models matching these atmospheric parameters provide us with estimates of stellar ages and masses\n(also listed in Valenti & Fischer, 2005). Stellar masses are\nall close to solar, except HD 76151 that lies 2\u03c3 above 1 M .\nNote however that Nordstrom et al. (2004) propose for this\nstar a mass of 0.92+0.09\n\u22120.04 M , while all other stars of our list\nhave consistent mass estimates in both catalogues. All ages\nare consistent with a solar age, but the related uncertainties\nare generally in excess of 2 Gyr. In particular, HD 190771\nis probably younger than the Sun (given its metallicity and\nfast rotation), but is still sufficiently evolved to be taken as\na probable main-sequence dwarf. As far as the dynamo itself\nis concerned, this large uncertainty in stellar ages could be\na relevant issue in case the depth of the convection zone was\nexpected to significantly vary during the course of the main\nsequence. 1M models produced by stellar evolution codes\npredict however that the radius of the base of the convection\nzone remains constant within 5% over the first 9 Gyrs of the\nmain sequence (S. Th\u00e9ado, private communication).\nFrom this set of stellar parameters, and given the related uncertainties, we conclude that the internal structure\nof the selected objects are probably very close to the Sun's,\nwith a dynamo action that should differ from the solar dynamo through the dominant effect of rotation, including differential rotation (and possibly an unknown meridional circulation).\n\n3\n\nSPECTROPOLARIMETRIC DATA SET AND\nMAGNETIC MAPPING\n\nThe observational material consists of high-resolution spectra obtained simultaneously in classical spectroscopy (Stokes\nI) and circularly polarized light (Stokes V) in 2007 winter and summer, using the newly installed NARVAL stellar\nspectropolarimeter at T\u00e9lescope Bernard Lyot (Observatoire\ndu Pic du Midi, France). As a strict copy of ESPaDOnS (Petit et al. 2003), NARVAL provides full coverage of the optical domain (370 nm to 1,000 nm) in a single exposure, at\na resolving power of 65,000, with a peak efficiency of about\n15% (telescope and detector included). It is constituted of a\nbench-mounted spectrograph (based on a dual-pupil design\nand stored in a double thermal enclosure), fiber-fed from a\nCassegrain-mounted module containing all polarimetric facilities. A series of 3 Fresnel rhombs (two half-wave rhombs\nthat can rotate about the optical axis and one quarter-wave\nrhomb) are employed to perform a very efficient polarimetric\nanalysis over the whole spectral domain. They are followed\nby a Wollaston prism which splits the incident light into two\nbeams, respectively containing light linearly polarized perpendicular/parallel to the axis of the prism. The two beams\nproduced by the Wollaston prism are imaged onto the two\noptical fibers that carry the light to the spectrograph. Each\nStokes V spectrum is obtained from a combination of four\nsub-exposures taken with the half-wave rhombs oriented at\ndifferent azimuths (Semel et al. 1993). The data reduction\nis performed by Libre-Esprit, a dedicated, fully automated\n\n\fToroidal vs. poloidal magnetic fields in Sun-like stars\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

(1997) and implementing the optimal spectral extraction principle of Horne (1986)\nand Marsh (1989).\nA total of 9 to 14 spectra was collected for each star, at a\nrate of one spectrum every clear night (Table 2). A single, average photospheric line profile was extracted from each spectrum using the LSD technique (Donati et al. 1997), according to a line-list matching a solar photospheric model. Using\na total of some 5,000 atomic spectral lines with wavelengths\nbetween 370 nm and 1 \u03bcm, the noise level of the mean Stokes\nV profiles is reduced by a factor of about 40 with respect to\nthe initial spectrum. The resulting noise level, listed in Table\n2, ranges between 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 Ic (where Ic denotes the continuum level) depending on the source, on the\nfluctuating weather and on the adopted exposure time. The\nrecorded sets of Stokes V profiles are plotted in Fig. 1. Cir-\n\ncularly polarized signals are detected for each star, centered\nat the radial velocity of the unpolarized mean line profile.\nWe interpret this spectral line polarization as Zeeman signatures related to the presence of large-scale photospheric\nmagnetic fields. This detection, achieved for the first time\nin solar twins, is made possible by the combination of the\nlarge spectral domain (ensuring highly efficient multi-line\ntechniques) and high S/N of polarized spectra (achievable\nthanks to the high collecting power of the instrumental device).\nAssuming that the observed temporal variability of\nStokes V profiles is controlled by the stellar rotation, we reconstruct the magnetic geometry of our targets by means of\nZeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). We employ here the modelling strategy of Donati & Brown (1997), including also the\nspherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field\n\n\f4\n\nP.

Periodograms obtained for HD 73350, HD 76151 and\nHD 146233 (red, green and blue lines, respectively).\n\nFigure 3. \u03c72 map obtained when varying the differential rotation\nparameters of HD 190771. \u03a9eq is the rotation rate of the equator\nand d\u03a9 represents the difference in rotation rate between pole\nand equator (assuming a sin2 dependence of rotation rate with\ncolatitude).\n\nthe estimate of Valenti & Fischer is not compatible with the\nrotation period we derive for this star). Prior to rotational\nbroadening, we adopt a very simple gaussian model for the\nunpolarized line profile, in which any type of line broadening other than rotational enter, including instrumental\nsmearing. We only have to slightly adjust the FWHM of the\nlocal profile (between 10.1 and 10.4 km s\u22121 , depending on\nthe star) to obtain a convincing adjustment of the observed\nStokes I LSD profiles.\nTo determine the rotation period of our targets, we use\nthe principle of maximum entropy image reconstruction and\ncalculate a set of magnetic maps for each star, assuming var-\n\n\fToroidal vs. poloidal magnetic fields in Sun-like stars\nious values of the rotation period (Fig. 2). We then adopt the\nrotation period that minimizes the \u03c72 of the reconstructed\nspectra, at fixed information content (following the approach\nof Petit et al. 2002). For all stars except HD 190771, the temporal evolution of the polarized signal is consistent with a\nsolid-body rotation. For HD 190771 however, this assumption does not yield a convincing adjustment of the Stokes\nV time-series (\u03c72 = 1.5). A better fit to the profiles (\u03c72 =\n1.1) is obtained by including a solar-like differential rotation\nlaw in the imaging procedure (Petit et al., 2002 and Fig. 3).\nUsing the same method with HD 73350, we also obtain a \u03c72\nminimum in the \u03a9eq -d\u03a9 plane, but with error bars too large\nto exclude a solid-body rotation. The two other stars do not\nshow any \u03c72 minimum along the d\u03a9 axis.\nFor HD 73350, HD 76151 and HD 190771, our estimates of the rotation period (see Table 1) are 20% to 25%\nlarger than literature values derived from the less accurate\nperiod determination using chromospheric activity indicators (Noyes et al. 1984, Wright et al. 2004). For HD 146233,\nthe level of chromospheric emission and the periodic modulation of Zeeman signatures provide consistent estimates.\nThe observed rotation phases are listed in Table 2, using\nthe rotation periods of Table 1 and imposing JD=2454101.5\n(2007 Jan. 01 at 00:00 UT) as phase zero for all stars.\nFrom the combined knowledge of the rotation period\nand v sin i, we can finally deduce the inclination angle i of\nthe rotation axis with respect to the line of sight (Table 1),\nassuming that for all targets the stellar radius can be taken\nequal to the solar radius (luminosities and effective temperatures taken from Valenti & Fischer, 2005, ensure that stellar\nradii of our targets are equal to the Sun's within \u22485%). Using this set of stellar parameters, we then reconstruct photospheric magnetic maps of our stellar sample (Figs. 4 and\n5). By doing so, all data sets are fitted down to the noise\nlevel (0.9 \u2264 \u03c72 \u2264 1.1, depending on the star). We note that\nthe hypothesis of a purely potential field is actually sufficient to adjust the Stokes V profiles of HD 146233 and HD\n76151 at the same \u03c72 , without affecting the magnetic map.\nFor HD 73350 however, assuming a purely potential magnetic field does not allow the inversion procedure to reach\nbetter than \u03c72 =1.5. The situation is even worse with HD\n190771, for which the final \u03c72 cannot be better than 5 without the addition of a toroidal magnetic field. We check that\nthe magnetic maps remain essentially unaffected by the `\nlimit, provided that the magnetic expansion respects ` \u2265 4\nfor HD 73350, ` \u2265 3 for HD 190771, ` \u2265 2 for HD 146233 and\nHD 76151. For all four stars, we choose to limit the magnetic\nmodel to a spherical harmonics expansion of degree ` \u2264 10.\nFrom the estimated spherical harmonics coefficients, we\ncan derive a set of numerical quantities to characterize the\nreconstructed magnetic topologies (Table 3). To evaluate the\nuncertainties on these numerical estimates, we vary the values of stellar parameters (rotation period, v sin i, inclination\nangle) over the width of the error bar on each individual\nparameter and reconstruct a magnetic map for each new\ncombination of the parameters. The observed variations in\nthe output magnetic quantities are quoted as error bars in\nTable 3 and give an estimate of the uncertainties on the\nreconstructed magnetic geometries.\n\n4\n4.1\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\nMagnetic energy of the large-scale field\n\nThe mean (unsigned) magnetic field of the reconstructed\nmaps increases with the rotation rate (Figs. 4, 5 and 6 and\nTable 3). This trend is in qualitative agreement with previous studies investigating the rotational dependence of various magnetic tracers, in particular the chromospheric flux\n(e.g. Noyes et al. 1984, Wright et al. 2004, Hall et al. 2007a)\nor the Zeeman broadening of magnetically-sensitive spectral\nlines (Saar 2001). From our set of spectropolarimetric observations, we derive that the magnetic energy of the large-scale\nfield increases by a factor of \u2248 120 from HD 146233 (Peq\nrot\n= 22.7 d) to HD 190771 (Peq\nrot = 8.8 d). This evolution affects both poloidal and toroidal magnetic components, but\nthe poloidal magnetic energy grows by a factor of about 40,\nwhile the toroidal magnetic energy is increased by a factor\nof 104 .\nFrom our sets of spectra, we can estimate the chro0\npamospheric emission of the selected stars from the RHK\nrameter (defined as the ratio of the chromospheric emission\nin CaII H & K line cores to the stellar bolometric emission). Plotted against the mean magnetic field (Fig. 6), the\nchromospheric emission is following a power-law of the form\n0\n) = 0.32 log(Bmean ) \u2212 4.98. We obtain a very simlog(RHK\n0\ninstead of\nilar result when using literature values of RHK\n0.33\n0\nNARVAL values (RHK \u221d Bmean ). This dependence differs\n0.6\nfrom solar observations, from which an increase like Bmean\nis derived in the quiet Sun and active regions (Schrijver et\nal. 1989, Ortiz & Rast 2005).\nIn the case of low v sin i values, Zeeman-Doppler magnetic maps are only sensitive to low-order field components,\nwhile the measured chromospheric flux includes the contribution of smaller-scale elements as well (active regions\nand plages), irrespective of the rotation rate. Since the spatial resolution achieved through ZDI increases with v sin i,\none could then argue that higher-order magnetic components might be resolved in the most rapidly-rotating stars\nof our sample and might thus be included in the magnetic\nenergy we measure, explaining why the mean magnetic field\nseems to grow much faster with rotation than the chromospheric flux. We actually observe that spherical harmonics\nmodes with ` \u2264 3 (spatially resolved for all stars of our\nsample) always contain more than 94% of the total photospheric magnetic energy, even for stars with the largest\nv sin i, and despite the fact that our magnetic modelling\nallows for higher-order magnetic components to be reconstructed up to ` = 10. In fact, the v sin i range of our sample\n(from 1.2 to 4.3 km s\u22121 ) is sufficiently limited to ensure a\nconsistent behaviour of the imaging procedure for all targets\n(given the spectral resolution of NARVAL, limited to 65,000\nin polarimetric mode), and therefore a consistent estimate\nof the magnetic energy of the large-scale field.\nFrom these arguments, we propose that the observed\ndiscrepancy with the solar case is genuine. A first possibility\nis that horizontal magnetic fields (in particular the prominant toroidal field components seen in Fig. 5) are not able to\npenetrate the chromosphere and contribute to produce enhanced CaII emission. To test this idea, we have calculated\nthe power law we obtain by considering the radial field component only (Fig. 6, blue symbols). By doing so, we only\n0\n0.36\nslightly change the exponent (with RHK\n\u221d Bmean\n) and re-\n\n\f6\n\nP. Petit et al.\n\nFigure 4. Magnetic maps of HD 146233 and HD 76151 (left and right panel, respectively). Each chart illustrates the field projection\nonto one axis of the spherical coordinate frame. The magnetic field strength is expressed in Gauss. Vertical ticks above the charts indicate\nthe observed rotational phases. Note that color scales are not the same for every star.\n\nmain still very far from the steeper solar dependence. A\nsecond possibility is that a higher coverage of cool spots in\nfast-rotating Suns may contribute to alter the exponent in\nthe power-law (which is valid for the quiet Sun and plages,\nnot for sunspots). However, the dominant contributor to the\nZeeman signatures we observe is probably not originating\nfrom cool spots (except possibly the spot penumbra), since\nthe contrast with the rest of the photosphere will mostly\nhide the signal formed in these dark regions. By constraining the temperature of magnetic regions observed in cool\nactive stars, previous studies (R\u00fcedi et al. 1997, Petit et\nal. 2005) confirm that the observed magnetic elements are\nhotter than the surrounding (non magnetic) material. Petit et al. (2005) also show that Stokes V Zeeman signatures\nformed by the large-scale field of solar-type stars are asymmetric, with a difference of area and amplitude between the\ntwo lobes of the profile typical of solar faculae.\n\nelements, see Sect. 1), from which Saar (2001) obtains an\nexponent equal to -1.2.\nFinally, we note that the observed increase of the mean\nmagnetic field with the rotation rate is also in agreement\nwith recent 3-D MHD simulations of fast-rotating Suns\n(Brown et al. 2007a, 2007b). In these simulations, the global\nfield becomes stronger within the bulk of the convection zone\nwhen the rotation rate is increasing. This behaviour contrasts with classical solar MHD models where weak magnetic fields with little global-scale structure are produced\nand where fluctuating parts dominate near the surface (Brun\net al. 2004). In other words, a way to organize and amplify\nmagnetic fields in these global MHD simulations would consist in increasing the star rotation, what we also observe here\nwith these four Sun-like stars.\n\nWe therefore propose a third interpretation and suggest that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy\nis stored in large scales as rotation grows, so that a larger\nfraction of the actual magnetic energy becomes measurable\nthrough ZDI, even when the field reconstruction is limited to\nlarge-scale structures. This conclusion is also supported by\nthe observed increase of the mean magnetic field, for which\n\u22121.8\na power-law of the form Bmean = 2.8 \u00d7 103 Prot\nis derived\nfrom our observations. This increase is steeper than that\nderived from Zeeman broadening of spectral lines (a measurement technique also sensitive to smaller-scale magnetic\n\nThe second noticeable effect of rotation is to increase the\nfraction of the magnetic energy stored into a large-scale\ntoroidal component of the surface magnetic field (Figs. 4 and\n5). While the toroidal component is negligible for HD 146233\nand HD 76151 (representing respectively 1% and 7% of their\nlarge-scale magnetic energy, Table 3), the magnetic field becomes predominantly toroidal for stars rotating faster (up\nto 65% of the magnetic energy of HD 190771). The absence\nof any significant toroidal component for slow rotators is\nunlikely to come from an intrinsic limitation of ZDI in the\nlow v sin i regime (where the sharp line profiles may favour\n\n4.2\n\nLarge-scale toroidal component\n\n\fToroidal vs. poloidal magnetic fields in Sun-like stars\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. Same as Fig. 4, for HD 73350 (left panel) and HD 190771 (right panel).\n\nZeeman signatures visible in the core of the line, i.e. radial/meridional magnetic fields against the azimuthal field\ncomponent). The main reason, already invoked in sect. 4.1,\nis that the v sin i range of our sample is sufficiently limited\nto ensure a consistent response of the imaging procedure\nover this domain. Another confirmation of this idea comes\nfrom observations of \u03be Bootis A by Petit et al. (2005), where\na predominant toroidal field is reported despite a projected\nrotational velocity as low as 3 km s\u22121 (close to the v sin i\nestimate proposed by Valenti & Fischer for HD 146233).\nThe mainly poloidal geometries of HD 146233 and\nHD 76151 are reminiscent of the large-scale solar magnetic\ngeometry and might be typical of low-activity dwarfs, at\nleast for stellar masses close to the Sun's. For higher spin\nrates, the development of a toroidal field is reminiscent of\nprevious ZDI studies of stars displaying a much higher magnetic activity than the Sun (e.g. Donati et al. 2003, Petit\net al 2005). Again, these observational results are now supported by recent numerical simulations of dynamo action in\nrapidly rotating solar-type stars (Brown et al. 2007b), where\nan increase by a factor 3 of the rotation rate compared to the\nsolar case results in a stable toroidal magnetic field at global\nscales, throughout the bulk of the convective envelope and\nwithout the help of any tachocline. The ordering of the magnetic field onto a large-scale toroidal component when the\nstar rotation increases is usually associated in MHD simulations with the inclusion of a tachocline at the base of\nthe convective zone (i.e. the addition of a strong local shear\nbetween the differentially rotating convective zone and the\nsolid-rotating radiative core). Solar models with a tachocline\n\nlead to the building of strong large-scale toroidal fields confined in this interface layer (Browning et al., 2006 & 2007),\nbut the ability of these toroidal fields to travel the whole convective zone while keeping their identity remains nevertheless a matter of debate (e.g., Dorch & Nordlund 2001, Jouve\n& Brun 2007) and the last simulations of rapidly rotating\nSuns without tachocline by Brown et al. precisely overcome\nthis problem. From our analysis, and despite the small number of objects in this first available stellar sample, we infer\nthat a rotation period smaller than \u2248 12 d is necessary for\nthe toroidal component to reach an energetic level similar to\nthat of the large-scale poloidal field. This is again in agreement with Brown et al. (2007b), where a dynamo model at\n\u03a9 = 3\u03a9 produces a toroidal/poloidal field strength ratio\ngreater than unity.\n\n4.3\n\nEnergy splitting between low-order magnetic\ncomponents\n\nNo clear rotational dependence is observed for the geometrical complexity of the reconstructed surface magnetic field.\nIf we first consider the poloidal field only, a majority of\nthe magnetic energy of this component is showing up in\nthe dipole for HD 76151 and HD 190771 (with 79% and\n43% of the total poloidal magnetic energy, respectively). For\nHD 146233, we reconstruct a predominantly quadrupolar\nfield (56% of the poloidal magnetic energy). For HD 73350,\nthe poloidal magnetic energy is more evenly distributed\nwithin the dipole, quadrupole and octopole (with 24%, 29%\nand 33% respectively).\n\n\f8\n\nP. Petit et al.\n\nIf we now consider the toroidal field alone (whenever\nits contribution is not negligible, i.e. for HD 73350 and HD\n190771), we always measure a predominance of the mode\n(l = 1, m = 0) (87% and 81% of the total toroidal magnetic energy of HD 73350 and HD 190771, respectively). The\nlarge-scale toroidal field is therefore mainly organized as an\naxi-symmetric ring, displaying a striking similarity with the\n\"sea-snake\" toroidal field structures produced by 3D MHD\nsimulations in the presence of rapid rotation (Brown et al.,\n2007b).\nIn the Sun, the geometrical complexity of the largescale field is varying during the solar cycle (e.g., Sanderson\net al. 2003). An axisymmetric dipole is observed close to\nthe solar minimum, but a high quadrupole/dipole ratio is\nobserved at solar maximum. We can naturally expect time\nvariability to occur for our stellar sample as well, implying\nthat the energy splitting between low-order field components\nshould be monitored over several years before discussing the\npossible informations it can disclose about the underlying\ndynamo.\n4.4\n\nDifferential rotation\n\nOne of our target (HD 190771) possesses a measurable level\nof differential rotation. The absence of positive measurements on other targets reflects the combined effect of higher\nrelative levels of noise and sparser phase sampling. With a\nlevel of rotational shear about 2.3 times that of the Sun,\nHD 190771 is following nicely the mass-trend derived observationally by Barnes et al. (2005) for other rapidly-rotating\nstars (note that, probably because of this observational bias\ntowards high rotation rates, the solar differential rotation\nparameters fall outside the mass dependence derived by\nBarnes et al.). The same authors also report an increase of\nd\u03a9 with \u03a9eq (despite considerable scatter in available differential rotation measurements). Our own analysis is in global\nagreement with previous estimates derived for similar rotation rates by Doppler imaging (Barnes et al. 2005), broadband photometry (Henry et al. 1995) and chromospheric\nmonitoring (Donahue et al. 1996).\nRecent 3D numerical simulations investigate global\nflows in the presence of rapid rotation (Brown et al. 2007a).\nTheir model simulate the convection up to 0.95 R and\nignore the very top layers of the convective zone. This radial limit could be problematic when comparing numerical\nsimulations to observations, since the rotation can possibly\nundergo steep gradients just below the surface of rotating\nstars, as it does in the Sun (Schou et al. 1998). Whatever\nthe conclusions of numerical simulations, we can therefore\nexpect some difference with a surface estimate of differential rotation, as derived from photospheric magnetic maps.\nDespite this possible issue, Brown et al. (2007a) come to\nconclusions in good agreement with our observations, with\na level of differential rotation d\u03a9 of 1 M stars increasing\nwith the spin rate by a factor of \u22483 when increasing the\nrotation from 1 to 3 \u03a9 .\nOur isolated measurement of differential rotation\nclearly deserves to be repeated on other stars, to confirm\nthe shear level we observe at 3\u03a9 for HD 190771 and derive\nsimilar measurements for different rotation rates. From our\nanalysis, we can already propose that an increase of d\u03a9 from\nslow to fast rotation may contribute to make the \u03a9 effect of\n\nthe stellar dynamo more efficient and may, as a consequence,\nhelp to build a global-scale toroidal field throughout the convective zone.\n4.5\n\nLong-term magnetic variability\n\nThe various magnetic properties we derive here may be\nsubject to long-term variability. The monitoring of chromospheric emission reported by Baliunas et al. (1995) and Hall\net al. (2007a, 2007b), actually shows that two of our targets\n(HD 76151 and HD 146233) follow activity cycles.\nWith a period of 7 years (Hall et al. 2007b), the cycle\nlength of HD 146233 is shorter than the solar cycle. The\nchromospheric activity of this solar twin was reported to\nsharply grow between 2004 and 2006 (after a regular decrease between 2000 and 2004), so that our spectropolarimetric observations of the summer of 2007 are likely to be\nrepresentative of a high activity state. The predominantly\nquadrupolar magnetic geometry we reconstruct at that time\nis reminiscent of the magnetic topology of the Sun at solar maximum. However, despite the fact that HD 146233 is\nknown as the best solar twin among bright stars, its short\ncycle length indicates that any comparison with the solar\nmagnetic topology should be considered with caution.\nThe long-term chromospheric variability of HD 76151\n(Baliunas et al., 1995) suggests the existence of a 2.5 yr\ncycle (of weak amplitude compared to chromospheric solar\nvariability), superimposed on a possibly much longer cycle,\nof higher amplitude and unknown period. Its last activity\npeak was recorded in 2006 (Hall et al. 2007a), so that our\ndata set was collected during the following decrease of activity.\nNo such long-term chromospheric follow-up is available\nfor HD 190771 and HD 73350. The comparison with other\nstars of similar activity levels and spectral types (Baliunas et\nal. 1995) reveal however that the cyclicity undergone by their\nCaII emission is generally less pronounced than in the Sun,\nwith a range of possible cycle lengths (depending on the star)\nand the co-existence of different time-scales of variability.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFrom a set of stellar spectropolarimetric observations, we\nreport the detection of surface magnetic fields in a sample\nof four solar-type stars. Assuming that the observed variability of the polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation, we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with\nvalues ranging from 8.8 d (for HD 190771) to 22.7 d (for\nHD 146233). One star of our sample (HD 190771) displays a\nmeasurable level of surface differential rotation, with a rotational shear about 2.3 times stronger than solar. Apart from\nrotation, fundamental parameters of the selected objects are\nvery close to the Sun's, making this sample a practical basis\nto investigate the specific impact of rotation on magnetic\nproperties of Sun-like stars.\nWe reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the\ntargets as a low-order (` < 10) spherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field. From the set of magnetic\nmaps, we draw two main conclusions. (a) The magnetic energy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate.

We list the mean unsigned magnetic field (Bmean ), the fraction\nof the large-scale magnetic energy reconstructed in the poloidal field component and the fraction of the poloidal magnetic energy in the\n0\ndipolar (` = 1), quadrupolar (` = 2) and octopolar (` = 3) components. In the last column, we also list log RHK\nvalues derived from our\nsets of Stokes I spectra.\nName\n\nBmean\n(G)\n\npol. en.\n(% tot)\n\ndipole\n(% pol)\n\nquad.\n(% pol)\n\noct.\n(% pol)\n\n0\nlog RHK\n\nHD 146233\nHD 76151\nHD 73350\nHD 190771\n\n3.6 \u00b1 1\n5.6 \u00b1 2\n42 \u00b1 7\n51 \u00b1 6\n\n99.3 \u00b1 0.2\n93 \u00b1 6\n52 \u00b1 3\n34 \u00b1 1\n\n34 \u00b1 6\n79 \u00b1 13\n24 \u00b1 5\n43 \u00b1 8\n\n56 \u00b1 6\n18 \u00b1 8\n29 \u00b1 8\n20 \u00b1 2\n\n10 \u00b1 10\n3\u00b13\n33 \u00b1 5\n23 \u00b1 4\n\n\u22124.85 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22124.69 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22124.48 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22124.42 \u00b1 0.02\n\nfield is flatter than observed in the Sun. Even if we cannot\ncompletely rule out the possible influence of increased spottedness in more active stars, this observation may suggest\nthat a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored\nin large scales as rotation increases (since the chromospheric\nflux is also sensitive to magnetic elements smaller than those\ncontributing to the polarimetric signal). (b) Whereas the\nmagnetic field is mostly poloidal for low rotation rates, more\nrapid rotators host a large-scale toroidal component in their\nsurface field. From our observations, we infer that a rotation period lower than \u224812 days is necessary for the toroidal\nmagnetic energy to dominate over the poloidal component.\nIn future work, we will investigate how this rotation\nthreshold may vary for various stellar masses, and therefore\nstudy how the depth of the convection zone may influence\nthe existence of global-scale toroidal magnetic fields at the\nstellar surface. This enlargement of the available stellar sample is already under way. The magnetic properties we derive\nhere may also be subject to some level of time variability.\nThis idea is supported by the long-term monitoring of chromospheric emission of Baliunas et al. (1995) and Hall et al.\n(2007a), in which two of our targets (HD 76151 and HD\n146233) are reported to follow activity cycles. Variabilities\nof the large-scale magnetic geometries related to such fluctuating activity remain to be unveiled. A long-term observing\nprogram is now started to gather the spectropolarimetric\ndata sets necessary to tackle this question, with the objective to offer a completely new set of observables with which\nto constrain stellar dynamo theories.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the staff of TBL for their help during the observing\nruns.
