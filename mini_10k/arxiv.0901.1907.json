The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law\n[1, 2] states that the number of earthquakes as a function\nof magnitude N (M ) scales as N (M ) \u223c 10\u2212bM . The exponent b is very nearly 1. The Omori law refers to temporal correlations between earthquakes, in particular to aftershocks, namely the temporal clustering of earthquakes\nfollowing a large one, usually called the main shock. The\nOmori law of aftershocks[7] states that the number of aftershocks per unit of time decays as \u223c (t + c)\u2212p with the\ntime t from the main shock. The exponent p is typically\nvery close to 1, and c is a time constant of the order between minutes and hours. Aftershocks occur mainly in\nthe spatial region where the rupture of the main shock\ntook place.\nThe GR law has been shown to be compatible with\na state of (at least partial) critical organization of the\nsystem[3, 4, 5] that is understandable in terms of springblock models, when an appropriate velocity weakening\nfriction law (i.e., a friction force decreasing with the\nrelative velocity of the sliding elements) is assumed to\nhold. This kind of modeling was pioneered by Burridge and Knopoff[6] (BK), and was extended along different directions afterwards, particularly in the works\non self-organized-criticality of the eighties [3, 4]. The\nBK model reproduces the global statistical behavior implied by the GR law, but it fails to account for the\nexistence of spatial and temporal correlations observed\nin actual seismicity. On searching for the origin of the\naftershock phenomenon, Dieterich[8] followed by others\n[9, 10, 11, 12] have shown that an analysis based on rateand-state equations[13, 14] is able to justify the appearance of aftershocks following the Omori decay. On this\nperspective, it is puzzling that the use of a BK model\nwith a rate-and-state friction law does not produce realistic aftershocks[15]. Although aftershocks usually are\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\njagla@cab.cnea.gov.ar\n\nresponsible for less than about 5 % of the total released\nseismic moment, the finding that the GR law is also\nobeyed within individual aftershock sequences strongly\nsuggests that consistent and compatible explanations for\nGR and Omori laws should exist. We may thus say that\nat present, there is not a single, unified picture of the\nphysics behind some of the most robust features of seismicity, namely GR and Omori laws. In addition, the use\nof rate-and-state equations, although widely supported\nby experimental results, remains essentially a crude phenomenological approach.\nWe show here that when a spring-block model without\nany a priori velocity dependent frictional force is complemented with an appropriate relaxational term as discussed below, it produces: 1) earthquake patterns and in\nparticular aftershock sequences quantitatively comparable with real ones, 2) a velocity weakening friction law,\nand in general, agreement with the predictions of the\nrate-and-state equations, and 3) a power law decay of\nnumber of earthquakes with magnitude compatible with\nthe GR law, with an exponent b that compares well with\nactual values.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL IN THE ABSENCE OF\nRELAXATION\n\nOur modeling is based on the original BK model[6],\nwith the important difference that the friction law between the blocks and the substrate is not a priori assumed to have any particular form such as the velocityweakening form commonly used. A velocity dependent\nfriction law emerges naturally at large scales from the\ncharacteristic collective dynamics of elastic manifolds in\nrandom media[16]. In this context, an elastic interface\n(which corresponds to the blocks joined by springs in the\nBK model - we already describe the two dimensional case,\nmore appropriate to real faults) is driven through a disordered potential energy landscape (the 'substrate') that\nmodels the random nature of asperities. The velocitydependent frictional force between the blocks and the\nsubstrate of the BK model is therefore replaced by a disordered potential energy landscape that is chosen ran-\n\n\f2\n(A)\n\ndomly and uncorrelated for each point block of the discretized interface. In concrete, our model is described by\nthe overdamped equation\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u2202ui,j\n= k0 \u22072 ui,j + fi,j + k1 (X0 (t) \u2212 ui,j )\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ui,j is a continuous variable representing the displacement of the block labeled by the indices (i, j) in\na two dimensional grid, X0 (t) is the driving variable\n(usually X0 (t) = V t, we will refer also to X0 and to\nk1 (X0 (t) \u2212 ui,j ) as the strain and local stress in the system, respectively), \u22072 is the discrete Laplacian operator,\nand fi,j is the pinning force at each block, which is assumed to be short-range correlated along the direction of\nthe block displacements. For numerical convenience this\nspatially random force is chosen in the following way: a\nrandom position u0i,j is selected for each i, j, then the\nforce is fi,j = k(ui,j \u2212 u0i,j ). When, upon the dynamical\nth\nevolution, fi,j reaches some threshold value fi,j\n(that is\nchosen randomly distributed between 1+\u03ba and 1\u2212\u03ba), the\ncorresponding u0i,j is given the value ui,j + \u03b4, where \u03b4 is\nrandomly chosen between \u22121 and 1. Also, a new threshold is assigned to site i, j. Similar results are obtained by\nusing standard, though computationally more demanding, short-ranged correlated smooth pinning forces such\nas the ones used in Refs. [17, 18].\nWe use periodic boundary conditions, and from now\non, we set the values k0 = 0.1, k = 1, \u03ba = 0.8. Taking\nalso the numerical lattice constant as unity, this renders\nour time, distance, and forces, dimensionless. We have\ntried other parameter sets, finding no qualitatively new\nresults. The value of \u03bb in Eq. (1) fixes the time scale necessary for the surface to adapt to the conditions dictated\nby u0 and X0 . We work in the case \u03bb \u2192 0, i.e., we give\nthe surface time to relax to what we call a meta-stable\nconfiguration, defined by equating the right hand side of\nEq. (1) to zero, for fixed values of X0 and u0i,j . Note\nin particular that this also means that the duration of\nindividual earthquakes is zero in our implementation.\nAbrupt rearrangements occur in the system whenever\nat some particular position i, j the force from the pinning\npotential of the substrate is not able to sustain any more\nthe surface pinned to it (see an example of this situation\nin Fig. 1A). In this situation the local rearrangement\nof the surface can trigger instability events in neighbor\nsites, and the process continues until the surface finds a\nnew globally stable configuration. The full sequence of all\nrearrangements triggered by an initial instability is what\nwe call an event, or an earthquake, being the position of\nthe triggering instability its epicenter. We\nP measure the\nseismic moment m0 of events as m0 = i,j \u2206i,j where\n\u2206i,j is the displacement caused by the event at position\ni, j. In order to compare with real earthquakes, the magnitude M of an event is defined from the seismic moment\nas M = 2/3 log10 m0 .\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\naftershock\nepicenter\n\nmain shock\nepicenter\n\nFIG. 1: One dimensional sketch of main processes that occur\nin our model. (A) In the absence of relaxation, the interface (vertical line, with coordinates ui,j ) is driven to the right\nby an external force (not shown) through a set of randomly\nplaced pinning centers, represented by the gray rectangles.\nThe mid point of the rectangles have coordinates u0i,j , and\nthe horizontal length is the range in which pinning is effecth\ntive. Different lengths indicate different threshold values fi,j\n.\nUpon driving, the system passes from the configuration indicated by the continuous line to the dashed line, and an\nevent is triggered at the site indicated by the arrow, where\nthe maximum local pinning force is overpassed. The system\ngoes through a cascade process (not fully indicated) onto a\nnew meta-stable configuration (dotted line) in which some\npinning centers have been refreshed (outlined rectangles). In\n(B) structural relaxation is acting. A quite relaxed (and therefore more coherently pinned) initial configuration (continuous\nline) is driven until a main shock occurs, at the configuration corresponding to the dashed line. After the system has\nreached a meta-stable configuration (dotted line and outlined\nrectangles) relaxation continuous to act modifying the position of the pinning centers. The arrows at the center of the\nrectangles indicate the local value of (u\u2212u0 ). The arrows just\noutside the rectangles indicate the values of du0 /dt according\nto Eq. (2), that produce a drift in the position of the pinning\ncenters. This drift may cause a further instability as can be\nseen in (C). The process in (C) is an aftershock to the main\nshock in (B).\n\nA.\n\nResults\n\nOur model in the absence of relaxation has been widely\nstudied, and is known to have a well defined size distribution of events[17, 18, 19, 20] (note that the usual\ndefinition of the decay exponent \u03c4 is given as a func-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Results without relaxation.

We observe a power law with exponent\nb \u2243 0.4, which is consistent with the expected results\nfor two dimensional elastic interfaces both from scaling\narguments[19] and from recent analytical and numerical\ncalculations[20]. This value is however well different from\nthe b \u2243 1 observed for actual earthquakes. An exponential cut-off for large event size exists due to confinement.\nThis cut-off is controlled by the rigidity k1 of the driving\nspring and occurs when the spatial extent of the events\n\u2212\u03b6/2\nin the direction of the displacements is of order k1\n,\nwith \u03b6 the interface roughness exponent at low velocities.\nThe crossover to the exponential behavior thus moves to\nlarger magnitudes as k1 is decreased [17, 18, 19, 20].\nIn Fig. 2B we show a time-magnitude plot of all events\noccurring in a particular time interval. It is apparent that\nno obvious temporal correlations occur in this case, and\nmore quantitative observations confirm this fact. Spatial\ncorrelations are not observed neither. This is qualitatively similar to what has been obtained for the original\nBK model[6].\n\nIII.\n\nMODEL IN THE PRESENCE OF\nRELAXATION\n\nSo far, in the present form, the model does not give any\nclue on the reason for earthquake clustering, or the origin\nof a velocity weakening friction law. However, the inclu-\n\nFIG. 3: Results for the model with relaxation as compared\nto earthquakes in California[24].

(B) Actual earthquakes in the California area.\n\nsion of a simple additional ingredient changes this scenario drastically. This ingredient turns out to be what\nwe have called structural relaxation [21]. The primary\nphysical justification of its inclusion is the following. It\nis known that in solid friction the friction coefficient at\nrest increases with the time the surfaces have been in\ncontact [22, 23]. This is telling us about the existence of\na temporal dependent mechanism that makes the sliding\nsurfaces get more attached or pinned to each other when\nthey remain in contact for a longer period of time. In\nthe present model, a rather simple way to include such\nan effect is to consider, in addition to the random pinning\nforce that the substrate performs on the sliding surface,\nthe reaction that the surface performs onto the substrate.\nIf we give the substrate the possibility to react to this\nforce, the system will gain pinning energy by making the\nsubstrate more correlated, so to pin better the correlated\ninterface structure. This is in general a slow process,\nand the longer the surface remains in contact with the\nsubstrate, the stronger the join. This process of attachment is however stopped and restarted when a slip event\noccurs, since the values of the disordered potential refreshen, becoming uncorrelated again. We will show in\nthe following that this simple mechanism is enough to explain, in particular, the appearance of a robust sequence\nof aftershocks, and the occurrence of a velocity weakening friction law. Our structural relaxation mechanism is\n\n\f4\n\n\u2206t+c2 [days]\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n1E-4\n\n1E-3\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n10\n\nN(t)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Spatial distribution of aftershocks in the simulations.\nThe slip surface of a large event (shadowing proportional to\nthe local slip) and the before- (full) and after-events (open\nsymbols) of magnitude larger than 0 occurring in a symmetric time interval \u03b4t = 0.0022 around the main event are shown.\nThe increase in seismicity after the main shock is clearly observable, as well as the localization of aftershocks mainly at\nand near the slip surface of the main shock. The figure depicts\na portion of size 350x350 of a system of 512x512.\n\nwhat in other contexts is called the ageing of the material.\nThe modification to the model is as follows. We allow\nthe values of u0i,j to relax in time according to\n\u2202u0i,j\n= \u2212R\u22072 fi,j = Rk\u22072 (u0i,j \u2212 ui,j ).\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nThis conserved dynamics for the shift of the disorder potential at different block points is a generic way to introduce the back effect of the surface on the substrate\n(the actualization of the u0 's when a slip event occurs is\nmade as before). The coefficient R is a measure of the\nintensity or rate of relaxation, and can thus be related to\nexperimental relaxation times. Equation (2) generates\na tendency for the local forces fi,j to become uniform\nacross the system, generating a stronger contact between\nsurface and substrate. This relaxational effect competes\nwith the driving, which forces the movement of the surface onto the substrate at a fixed average velocity V .\nThe relevant parameter that measures the competition\nbetween the two effects is the ratio R/V .\nThe mechanism by which earthquake clustering occurs\ncan be summarized as follows (see Fig. 1). If a particular\nregion of the sample has not experienced a large event in\na rather long period of time, the structural relaxation has\nmade this region stronger (Fig. 1(B)). When an event occurs (driven by the overall displacement between surface\nand substrate) the contacts refreshen and large variations\nin the local forces remain. Relaxation continues to act,\ntrying to uniformize the local forces. In this process,\nparticular points that were originally stable immediately\n\n\u2206t+c1\n\n[t]\nFIG. 5: The Omori law.

Note that in this description it is obvious that aftershocks will occur at, or near, the rupture\nregion of the main shock. It is also worth noting here that\naftershocks are triggered by the inner dynamics of the\nsystem, and that most aftershocks occur also if we stop\nthe driving of the system after the main shock. The seemingly contradictory fact that aftershocks (which must be\ntriggered by an initial instability) are originated in a relaxation mechanism is understood when one realizes that\ndue to the disorder, relaxation according to Eq. (2) may\nproduce local increases in the forces fi,j , and this can\ntrigger aftershocks if a local threshold is overcome. Note\nin this respect the opposite direction between (u \u2212 u0 )\nand du0 /dt at the aftershock epicenter, in Fig. 1C.\n\nA.\n\nResults and comparison with an actual\nearthquake sequence\n\nIn Fig. 3A we show a magnitude-time plot of events in\na simulation of a system of 512x512 sites, in the presence\nof relaxation (R/V = 500). For comparison, the same\nplot for the earthquakes in the California area [24] is\npresented as Fig. 3B. The visual similarity is striking.\nIn both graphs, the very large activity immediately after\nlarge events, i.e., the existence of aftershocks, is apparent.\nIt is worth noting here that a minimum value around\nR/V \u223c 100 of relaxation is necessary in order to observe\naftershocks in the model, so the structural relaxation is\n\n\factual\nearthquakes\n\n3000\n\ncummulative number of events\n\nt\n\n6000\n\n6000\n\nA\n\n4500\n\n1.1\n\n3000\n\nmodel\n\n1500\n0\n2.932\n\n2.934\n\nt\n\n1.0\n2.936\n\nB\n5000\n\n9.1\n\n2500\n\n0\n\ncummulative seismic moment\n(arb.units)\n\n0\n\n2.95\n\ncummulative seismic moment\n(arb.units)\n\ncummulative number of events\n(arb.units)\n\n2.90\n\nB\n\ncummulative number of events\n\nmodel\n\ncummulative seismic moment\n(arb.units)\n\nA\n\ncummulative seismic moment\n(arb.units)\n\ncummulative number of events\n(arb.units)\n\n5\n\nactual\nearthquakes\n6630\n\n6640\n\n6650\n\nt (days)\n\n9.0\n\n8.9\n\n9000\n\nt (days)\n\nFIG. 6: Cumulative number of events and cumulative seismic\nmoment for the sequences presented in Fig. 3.\n\nthe crucial ingredient behind these particular effects.\nThe spatial location of aftershocks are strongly correlated with the slip surface of the main event. In Fig. 4 we\nshow the region that has slip in a large event in the simulations, together with the epicenters of all events occurring in a symmetric time interval around the main shock.\nEvents before and after the main shock are shown in a\nseparate way. We see that there is a rather uniform spatial distribution of before-events, whereas once the main\nshock has occurred, aftershocks occur at and near the\nregion in which the main slip occurred.\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the histogram with the number of\nevents after a main shock as a function of time. In the\nsimulations, we average over 120 large events in a single\nsimulation of size 512x512. The continuous lines correspond to Omori laws of the form N (t) = A/(t \u2212 t0 + c)p +\nN0 , where t0 is the time of the main shock and N0 is the\nvalue of background seismicity. For reference, we also\nplot the number of aftershocks of the seven earthquake\nwith M > 6.0 in the California area in the considered\ntime period. Both cases are well fitted by an Omori law\nwith p \u223c 1.\nFigure 6 shows plots of cumulated number of events\nand seismic moment corresponding to the sequences presented in Fig.3, and Fig. 7 is a detail after the events\nindicated by vertical arrows in Fig. 6. The cumulative\nnumber of events is fitted in both cases with a cumulative Omori law, with p = 1 with very good agreement.\n\nFIG. 7: Detail to Fig. 6. Cumulative number of events and\ncumulative seismic moment (taken as zero just before the\nmain shock), following the events indicated by vertical arrows in Fig. 6. In both cases, dotted lines are fitting to the\n(cumulative) Omori law with p = 1.\n\nThe evolution of the accumulated seismic moment is also\nqualitatively similar in both cases, with the main shock\naccounting for most of the released seismic moment of\nthe whole sequence.\nFinally, in Fig. 8 we present an analysis of the time intervals \u2206t between successive events of magnitude larger\nthan some defined threshold M0 . The main characteristics observed for the real sequence, that are reproduced\nby our model are the following. The curves are roughly\nindependent of the threshold value M0 chosen, and the\nglobal behavior represents almost an exponential decay\nwith \u2206t, but with a reproducible excess of events at low\n\u2206t. This excess is accounted for by the aftershocks.\n\nIV.\n\nAVERAGED FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES\n\nThe second set of results that we present corresponds\nto the stress-strain relation of the model for different driving protocols. First of all we recall that the model without relaxation shows a stress \u03c3 that is independent of\nthe strain rate, since the internal time scale of the model\nis very rapid compared to the driving. In Eq. (1) this\nmeans that \u03bb/V \u2192 0.

Distribution of the times\n(normalized by the mean time \u2206tm ) between events of magnitude larger than M0 for our data (A) and for earthquakes in\nCalifornia (B). Independence of M0 , and a rather exponential\ndistribution with an excess due to aftershocks for small \u2206t is\nobserved in both cases.\n\nEq. (2)) and now the average stress in the system depends on the ratio R/V . When R/V is small, the effect\nof relaxation is negligible, and the stress will be similar\nto that in the absence of relaxation. However, if R/V is\nhigh enough, relaxation will act by effectively correlating the pinning potential in a larger spatial region. The\nsize of this region increases with R/V . A spatially more\ncorrelated pinning potential produces, in turn, a larger\naverage stress in the system. We conclude that the larger\nis R/V the larger is the average stress. In other words,\nthe model will display velocity weakening. In Fig. 9A\nwe show a plot of the stress in the system as a function\nof strain rate where this weakening is clearly observed.\nFor large strain rates the stress converges to the value\ncorresponding to no relaxation, whereas the behavior for\nvery small strain shows a saturation at a larger value.\nThe transition between these two values is logarithmic\nand spans about a factor of 100 of strain rate. Note that\nthe values reported above as necessary to observe aftershocks (R/V & 100) correspond to the limit of small\nvelocity in this plot. A closer examination at the instantaneous stress-strain relation reveals that the lower the\nstrain rate, the more pronounced the fluctuations in the\ninstantaneous stress.\nAdditional information on the frictional behavior is obtained by studying the system response to abrupt changes\nof the strain rate. We show in Fig. 9B in particular,\nthe stress on a system in which driving is stopped dur-\n\nFIG. 9: Global frictional properties of the model. (A) Mean\nstress in a system of 256x256 as a function of relative velocity.\nA detail of the temporal dependence of stress is given for two\npoints, emphasizing the larger fluctuations that appear when\nrelative velocity is lower. (B) Time evolution of stress in a\nsystem in which velocity is changed from V /R = 0 in the hold\nperiods (indicated by arrows), to V /R = 1 in the rest of time\n(results shown correspond to an average over ten realizations).\nInset: The value of the stress peak as a function of the hold\ntime.\n\ning some time interval (the hold time) and then is reinitiated. First of all, a logarithmic decrease of stress\nduring the hold time is observed. This occurs because\nthe system continues to relax during the hold time and\nsome instability events continue to occur for some time.\nThis is related to our previous statement that aftershocks\nalso occur if driving is stopped after a main shock. Despite the stress reduction during the hold time, a stress\npeak occurs after re-initiation of sliding. The height of\nthis peak increases logarithmically with the hold time.\nThis peak is a consequence of the more stable configuration that the system reached due to relaxation during\nthe hold time. The phenomenon is similar to the one\nobserved in glass forming materials, where it has been\nexplained using the same ideas [21]. These results are in\nremarkable agreement with those obtained in laboratory\nmeasurements [22, 25].\n\nV.\n\nGUTENBERG-RICHTER BEHAVIOR\n\nThe inclusion of relaxation produces also a change in\nthe decaying exponent b of the GR law. In Fig. 10 we see\nthat a power law decaying is maintained in the presence\n\n\f7\n\nN(M)\n\nR/V\n0\n100\n100\n100\n500\n2000\n\n1\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\nk1\n0.01\n0.02\n0.01\n0.005\n0.01\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n1E-4\n1E-5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nM\n\n3\n\n4\n\nvalue b \u223c 1 observed in actual seismicity.\nThe fact that the b exponent takes a value close to 1 in\nthe presence of relaxation, quite independent of the precise value of the relaxation parameter and other details\nof the model seems to indicate that relaxation takes the\nsystem out of its original universality class with b \u2243 0.4,\nto a new one with b \u2243 1.0. Coincidence of this value with\nactual ones is another indication that we are capturing\nessential features of the seismic process with the inclusion\nof the relaxation mechanism.\n\nVI.\nFIG. 10: The decaying of number of events with event magnitude. The R = 0 case is included again for reference. The\nthin continuous line shows the case b = 1, followed rather accurately by actual seismic events. The results in our model in\nthe presence of relaxation show a behavior compatible with\nthe actual seismicity, with a cut-off at large event size that\nincreases upon decreasing the spring constant k1 . However,\nfinite size effects seem to be appreciably for the system sizes\nused. The larger decaying rate observed for M < 1 is an\nspurious effect associated with events comparable in size with\nour numerical mesh.\n\nof relaxation, with a b value substantially larger than\nthat corresponding to no relaxation. Once a minimum\nvalue of relaxation has been over passed (R/V \u223c 20),\nthe b decaying exponent is quite insensitive to the precise value of relaxation. There seems to be an excess of\nevents of large magnitude, before the cut off is reached.\nThe cut off and the peak corresponding to large events\nare mainly dependent on the value k1 of the spring driving the system. The smaller this value, the larger is the\ncut-off. It is not clear however if this tendency can be\nextrapolated to very small values of k1 . Unfortunately,\nto simulate decreasing values of this spring constant requires an increase in system size, and we reach rapidly\nvery time consuming runs. The obtained decaying exponent in the presence of relaxation is compatible with the\n\n[1] C. H.

The motivation for this approach was to introduce, in a spring-block\nmodel, a mechanism that generates (and not merely assumes) non trivial frictional effects, which can produce\nrealistic temporal and spatial clustering of earthquakes.\nOur model allows to obtain a time sequence of events\nthat globally follow the GR law with a b \u2243 1 exponent, and at the same time highly non-trivial spatial and\ntemporal correlations compatible, in particular, with the\nOmori law. In addition we have shown that frictional\nproperties of the model compare very well with laboratory results. We think this model gives a unified and\ncomprehensive physical picture of all these phenomena.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was financially supported by Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Argentina.
