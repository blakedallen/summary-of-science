An almost PI algebra is a generalisation of a just infinite algebra which\ndoes not satisfy a polynomial identity. An almost PI algebra has some nice properties: It is prime, has a countable cofinal subset of ideals and when satisfying\nACC(semiprimes) (this happens, for example, when it is affine), it has only countably many height 1 primes.\nConsider an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra R of GK dimension\n< 3, where k is an uncountable field. R is an almost PI algebra. We give some\npossible additional conditions which make such an algebra primitive, see Theorems\n2.6, 2.7, 2.9 and 2.10. This gives a partial answer to Small's question: Let R be an\naffine prime Noetherian k-algebra of GK dimension 2, where k is any field. Does it\nfollow that R is PI or primitive?\nWe also show that the center of R is a finite dimensional field extension of k\n(Theorem 2.11), and if, in addition, k is algebraically closed, then R is stably\nalmost PI (Theorem 2.13).\n\nRemember that a just infinite algebra R over a field k is an algebra infinite dimensional over k whose nonzero two sided ideals have finite codimension. A just infinite\nalgebra can be PI or not. A generalisation of a non-PI just infinite algebra was made\nby Rowen who suggested the notion of an almost PI algebra. The notion of an almost\nPI algebra is also known to Small and probably to other researchers as well.\nLet R be an associative algebra with 1 over a field k. R is called an almost PI\nalgebra if R is non-PI and R/I is PI for each nonzero two sided ideal I in R. We will\nonly deal with algebras over a field, although in some cases we can take a commutative\nNoetherian ring with 1 instead of a field.\nIn the first section we shall see some properties of almost PI algebras.\nIn the second section we shall try to answer the above mentioned question of Small:\nDoes it follow that an affine prime Noetherian k-algebra R with GK dimension 2 is\nPI or primitive? Artin and Stafford in [2] have shown that this is true if R is graded.\nBell has shown in [3] that this is false if R is not Noetherian. His example is of\nan affine prime algebra of GK dimension 2 over any field, which is non-PI and has a\nnonzero Jacobson radical (hence not primitive). Smoktunowicz and Vishne's example\nin [29] also has a nonzero Jacobson radical. Bell in [6] has shown that when k is an\nuncountable field, an affine prime Goldie k-algebra with quadratic growth is PI or\nprimitive. His result motivates the more general question: Does it follow that an\naffine prime Goldie k-algebra R with GK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable\nfield, is PI or primitive?\nWe show that such an algebra R is PI or primitive if, in addition, k is algebraically\nclosed, and there exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R such that x + P \u2208 R/P is\nalgebraic over k, for every prime ideal P with co-GK 1, see Theorem 2.6. When k is\nnot algebraically closed, the existence of such a special non-algebraic element x \u2208 R,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nmay not guarantee that R is primitive. Therefore, we add another assumption, see\nTheorem 2.7, Theorem 2.9 and Theorem 2.10. The proofs are based on ideas from\nthe first section, from Farkas and Small's theorem ([8, Theorem 2.2]) and from Bell's\ntheorem ([6, Theorem 1.1]).\nWe also show that if R is an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra of GK\ndimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field, then its center is a finite dimensional\nfield extension of k (Theorem 2.11) and if, in addition, k is algebraically closed, then\nR is stably almost PI (the K-algebra R \u2297k K is an almost PI algebra, for every field\nextension K/k. Theorem 2.13). The proofs are based on [4].\nIn the third section we remark about just infinite algebras.\n1. Basic properties of almost PI algebras\n1.1. Primality.\nTheorem 1.1. If R is an almost PI algebra (not necessarily affine), then R is prime.\nProof. Otherwise, take A, B nonzero ideals in R such that AB = 0. Let f be a\npolynomial identity for R/A and let g be a polynomial identity for R/B. We can\nassume f = f (X1 , . . . , Xl ) and g = g(X1, . . . , Xl ). Now, \u2200r1 , . . . , rl \u2208 R we have\nf (r \u03041 , . . . , r \u0304l ) = 0\u0304, so f (r1 , . . . , rl ) + A = 0 + A, hence f (r1 , . . . , rl ) \u2208 A. Similarly, \u2200r1 , . . . , rl \u2208 R g(r1 , . . . , rl ) \u2208 B. Therefore \u2200r1 , . . . , rl \u2208 R (f g)(r1, . . . , rl ) =\nf (r1 , . . . , rl )g(r1 , . . . , rl ) \u2208 AB = 0, so f g is a polynomial identity for R, which is\nimpossible (by definition R is non-PI).\n\u0003\nRemark 1.2. This proof also works for a non-PI just infinite algebra (but not for a\nPI just infinite algebra).\nThe next is a very simple observation.\nCorollary 1.3. Let R be an almost PI algebra.\n(i) If R is Artinian, then it is simple.\n(ii) If R is Goldie and algebraic, then it is simple.\nProof.\n(i) Any prime Artinian ring is simple [21, 2.3.9].\n(ii) Any algebra which is prime Goldie and algebraic is simple. Indeed, in a prime\nGoldie algebra each nonzero two sided ideal contains a regular element [21,\nProposition 3.2.13]. But this regular element is algebraic, hence invertible.\n\u0003\nThere is a criterion for an affine infinite dimensional algebra to be just infinite:\nevery nonzero prime ideal has finite codimension, see [7, Corollary 1]. Instead of\naffinity we will assume ACC(ideals) and get the following criterion, which can be\nthought of as a corollary to Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 1.4. Let R be a weakly Noetherian non-PI algebra. Assume that for every\nnonzero prime ideal P , R/P is PI. Then R is an almost PI algebra.\nProof. Otherwise, there exists a nonzero ideal I \u0303 with R/I \u0303 non-PI. So T := {0 6=\nI \u22b3 R|R/I is non-PI} 6= \u2205. Let I1 \u2286 I2 \u2286 I3 \u2286 . . . be an ascending chain of ideals\nin T . Since R satisfies ACC(ideals), it follows that there exists m \u2265 1 such that\n\n\f3\n\nIm = Im+1 = Im+2 = . . .. So Im \u2208 T is an upper bound for our chain. Hence Zorn's\nLemma implies that T contains a maximal element, call it I.\nR/I is an almost PI algebra; Indeed, I \u2208 T implies that R/I is non-PI, and\nmaximality of I implies that for every I ( J, R/J is PI, so (R/I)/(J/I) \u223c\n= R/J is\nPI.\nTherefore, from Theorem 1.1, R/I is prime. Hence I is a (nonzero) prime ideal of\nR, so by assumption R/I is PI. We reached a contradiction, so there exists no such\nnonzero ideal I \u0303 with R/I \u0303 non-PI.\n\u0003\nOf course, a similar criterion can be given for a just infinite algebra. Observe that a\njust infinite algebra A is actually weakly Noetherian. Indeed, let I1 ( I2 ( I3 ( . . . be\nonto\nonto\nonto\nan ascending chain of proper ideals in A. Let I := \u222aIi . A/I1 \u2192 A/I2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 A/I,\nimplies dimk (A/I) < . . . < dimk (A/I2 ) < dimk (A/I1 ) < \u221e, which is impossible.\nProposition 1.5. Let R be a weakly Noetherian infinite dimensional k-algebra. Assume that for every nonzero prime ideal P , R/P is finite dimensional over k. Then\nR is a just infinite algebra.\nProof. Just replace in the proof of Corollary 1.4: non-PI by infinite dimensional, PI\nby finite dimensional, almost PI by just infinite, and Theorem 1.1 by [7, Theorem 1]\n(which says that a just infinite algebra is prime, whether affine or not).\n\u0003\nNext, we mimick an observation of Small ([17, Proposition 3.2] or [8, Lemma 2.1]),\nbut again instead of affinity we assume ACC(ideals).\nLemma 1.6. Let R be a weakly Noetherian non-PI k-algebra. Then R has a homomorphic image R\u0304 which is prime and almost PI.\nProof. Define T := {I \u22b3 R|R/I is non-PI}. Since R \u223c\n= R/0 is non-PI, T 6= \u2205. Let\nI1 \u2286 I2 \u2286 I3 \u2286 . . . be an ascending chain of ideals in T . Since R satisfies ACC(ideals),\nit follows that there exists m \u2265 1 such that Im = Im+1 = Im+2 = . . .. So Im \u2208 T is an\nupper bound for our chain. Hence Zorn's Lemma implies that T contains a maximal\nelement, call it I.\nR/I is an almost PI algebra; Indeed, I \u2208 T implies that R/I is non-PI, and\nmaximality of I implies that for every I ( J, R/J is PI, so (R/I)/(J/I) \u223c\n= R/J is\nPI.\nNow there are two ways to see that R\u0304 = R/I is prime: First, just use Theorem 1.1.\nSecond, use the following general claim: Let S be a non-PI algebra. If A and B are\n(nonzero) ideals of S such that S/A and S/B are PI, then AB 6= 0: Otherwise, AB =\n0. Let f be a polynomial identity for S/A and let g be a polynomial identity for S/B.\nWe can assume f = f (X1 , . . . , Xl ) and g = g(X1 , . . . , Xl ). Now, \u2200s1 , . . . , sl \u2208 S we\nhave f (s \u03041 , . . . , s\u0304l ) = 0\u0304, so f (s1 , . . . , sl ) + A = 0 + A, hence f (s1 , . . . , sl ) \u2208 A. Similarly,\n\u2200s1 , . . . , sl \u2208 S g(s1 , . . . , sl ) \u2208 B. Therefore, \u2200r1 , . . . , sl \u2208 S, (f g)(s1, . . . , sl ) =\nf (s1 , . . . , sl )g(s1 , . . . , sl ) \u2208 AB = 0, so f g is a polynomial identity for S, which is\nimpossible (by assumption S is non-PI).\nIn our case, R\u0304 is a non-PI algebra (it is almost PI). Take any nonzero ideals \u0100 and\nB\u0304 in R\u0304. R\u0304/\u0100 and R\u0304/B\u0304 are PI, so from the above claim \u0100B\u0304 6= 0\u0304. So R\u0304 is prime.\n\u0003\nSmall's observation shows that an affine just infinite algebra is prime (however, any\njust infinite algebra is prime [7, Theorem 1]) and our observation shows that a weakly\n\n\f4\n\nNoetherian almost PI algebra is prime (however, any almost PI algebra is prime as\nwas seen above in Theorem 1.1).\n1.2. Primitive ideals. In a PI ring every primitive ideal is maximal. Almost the\nsame is true in our case:\nProposition 1.7. If R is an almost PI algebra, then every nonzero primitive ideal is\nmaximal.\nProof. Take a nonzero primitive ideal P in R. R/P is primitive PI so by Kaplansky's\ntheorem it is simple. So P is maximal.\n\u0003\nThe next Proposition says that in an affine almost PI algebra, every nonzero primitive ideal has finite codimension. This property will be used in Lemma 3.5.\nProposition 1.8. Let R be an almost PI algebra and let P be a nonzero prime ideal\nin R. Then:\n(i) dimk (R/P ) < \u221e \u21d2 P is primitive (=maximal).\n(ii) If R is, in addition, affine: dimk (R/P ) < \u221e \u21d4 P is primitive.\n(i) R/P is prime and dimk (R/P ) < \u221e, hence R/P is simple ([20, Corollary 1.6.30]), so P is maximal.\n(ii) (\u21d0): R/P is primitive PI so by Kaplansky's theorem it is Artinian. So R/P\nis PI affine and Artinian, hence finite dimensional [16, 13.10.3(iv)].\n\u0003\n\nProof.\n\nLemma 1.9. Let R be an affine almost PI algebra. If:\n(i) For each nonzero prime ideal P , dimk (R/P ) < \u221e.\nor more generally:\n(ii) For each nonzero prime ideal P , R/P is algebraic over k.\nThen R is non-PI just infinite.\nProof.\n\n(i) This follows from [7, Corollary 1] which says that if in an affine infinite\ndimensional algebra each nonzero prime ideal has finite codimension, then the\nalgebra is just infinite (of course our algebra is infinite dimensional, since it is\nnon-PI).\n(ii) For each nonzero prime ideal P , R/P is an affine algebraic PI algebra, hence\nfinite dimensional (Kurosch problem for PI, see [16, 13.8.9(2)]).\n\u0003\n\nForm Proposition 1.8 and Lemma 1.9 we get the following corollaries.\nCorollary 1.10. Let R be an affine almost PI algebra. If every nonzero prime ideal\nis primitive, then R is non-PI just infinite.\nProof. From Proposition 1.8(ii) every nonzero prime ideal has finite codimension.\nNow use Lemma 1.9(i).\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.11. Let R be an affine almost PI algebra and assume that it is not\nsimple.\nR is non-PI just infinite \u21d4 R has classical Krull dimension 1.\n\n\f5\n\nProof. (\u21d2) Any just infinite algebra (whether PI or not, whether affine or not) has\nclassical Krull dimension 1; Indeed, each nonzero prime ideal has finite codimension,\nhence is maximal (see Proposition 1.8(i)). Also any just infinite algebra is prime ([7,\nTheorem 1]). Actually, since now we are only interested in a non-PI just infinite\n(affine) algebra, we have seen above in Remark 1.2 that such an algebra is prime.\nHence it is clear that R has classical Krull dimension 1.\n(\u21d0) In view of Lemma 1.9(i) it is enough to show that each nonzero prime ideal\nhas finite codimension. Let P be a nonzero prime ideal. Since R has classical Krull\ndimension 1, P must be maximal (otherwise, there exists a maximal ideal Q strictly\ncontaining P : 0 ( P ( Q, a contradiction). Now, Proposition 1.8(ii) implies\ndimk (R/P ) < \u221e. (Another proof for (\u21d0): Since R has classical Krull dimension\n1, every nonzero prime ideal is maximal. Hence, from corollary 1.10 R is non-PI just\ninfinite).\n\u0003\nThe following proposition shows that over an uncountable field k, an affine (nonsimple) almost PI algebra has classical Krull dimension 1, if it has only countably\nmany primitive ideals and if it has finite classical Krull dimension.\nRemark 1.12. In Rowen's paper [23]: The conclusion of Proposition 3.2 that R is\nprimitive is true even if R only has a countable separating set (which satisfies the\nadditional restriction (4) of that paper) for its nonzero primitive ideals instead of for\nits nonzero ideals. This can be seen directly from the proof there.\nProposition 1.13. Let R be an affine non-simple almost PI algebra over an uncountable field having only countably many primitive ideals. If R has finite classical Krull\ndimension, then R has classical Krull dimension 1. In other words, there is no such\nalgebra R with 2 \u2264 kdim(R) < \u221e, where kdim(R) is the classical Krull dimension of\nR. Moreover, R is non-PI just infinite.\nProof. By induction on kdim(R) < \u221e.\nkdim(R) = 2: We shall see that this is impossible. Otherwise, let R be such an\nalgebra. Denote all height 1 primes in R by {P\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A and all height 2 primes in R by\n{Q\u03b2 }\u03b2\u2208B . So Spec(R) = {0, P\u03b1 , Q\u03b2 }. |B| \u2264 \u05d00 from our assumption that there are\nonly countably many primitive ideals. Indeed, each height 2 prime must be maximal,\nsince the classical Krull dimension of R is 2. (Notice: |A| \u2264 \u05d00 from Proposition\n1.26). We claim that each height 1 prime must be maximal: Otherwise, there exists a\nheight 1 prime P\u03b1 which is not maximal. So P\u03b1 is strictly contained in some height 2\nprime. Let {Qi }i\u2208I be all those height 2 primes which contain P\u03b1 (I \u2286 B). We shall\nnow see that P\u03b1 must be primitive, hence by Proposition 1.7 maximal, a contradiction\nto our choice of P\u03b1 not being maximal.\n\u2022 If |I| < \u221e: 0\u0304 = J(R/P\u03b1 ) = \u2229i\u2208I (Qi /P\u03b1 ) where R/P\u03b1 is semiprimitive by\nprimality and the Razmyslov-Kemer-Braun theorem, and since R/P\u03b1 is prime\n(of course in a prime ring finite intersections of nonzero ideals are nonzero),\nit follows that 0\u0304 must be a primitive ideal of R/P\u03b1 .\n\u2022 If |I| = \u05d00 : actually in this case we shall see a claim also applicable to |I| <\n\u221e, so it is possible not to separate to two cases. {Qi /P\u03b1 }i\u2208I are all the\nnonzero prime ideals of R/P\u03b1 , and each is maximal in R/P\u03b1 (since each Qi is\nmaximal in R). So {Qi /P\u03b1 }i\u2208I are all the nonzero primitive ideals of R/P\u03b1 .\nTherefore, taking 0\u0304 6= \u0233i \u2208 (Qi /P\u03b1 ) yields a countable separating set for the\n\n\f6\n\nnonzero primitive ideals of R/P\u03b1 . Since R/P\u03b1 is PI, by Rowen's theorem\nZ(R/P\u03b1 ) \u2229 R\u0304y \u0304i R\u0304 6= 0\u0304, hence we may take 0\u0304 6= x\u0304i \u2208 Z(R/P\u03b1 ) \u2229 R\u0304y \u0304i R\u0304 and\nget a countable separating set for the nonzero primitive ideals of R/P\u03b1 with\nelements regular (any nonzero element of the center of a prime ring is regular)\nand commuting with each other. Thus from Theorem 3.3 of [23] this separating\nset satisfies (4) in that paper. Hence we can use Proposition 3.2 there (with\na little generalisation, as mentioned in Remark 1.12) and get that R/P\u03b1 is\nprimitive.\nTherefore, each height 1 prime must be maximal. But then obviously primes of height\n2 cannot exist, hence kdim(R) = 1 (remember that we have assumed that R is not\nsimple, so kdim(R) \u2265 1).\nkdim(R) = n: We shall see that this is impossible. Otherwise, let R be such\nan algebra. Denote all height 1 primes in R by {P\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A , all height 2 primes by\n{Q\u03b2 }\u03b2\u2208B , . . . , all height n \u2212 1 primes by {F\u03bd }\u03bd\u2208M , all height n primes by {G\u03bd }\u03bd\u2208N .\nSo Spec(R) = {0, P\u03b1, Q\u03b2 , . . . , F\u03bc , G\u03bd }. |N| \u2264 \u05d00 from our assumption that there are\nonly countably many primitive ideals. Indeed, each height n prime must be maximal,\nsince the classical Krull dimension of R is n. (Notice: |A| \u2264 \u05d00 from Proposition\n1.26). Be careful: we only know that |A| = |N| \u2264 \u05d00 , but the cardinality of the\nheight 2 primes until the height n \u2212 1 primes is not known. We claim that each\nheight n \u2212 1 prime must be maximal: Otherwise, there exists a height n \u2212 1 prime\nF\u03bc which is not maximal. So F\u03bc is strictly contained in some height n prime. Let\n{Gi }i\u2208I be all those height n primes which contain F\u03bc (I \u2286 N). We shall now see\nthat F\u03bc must be primitive, hence by Proposition 1.7 maximal, a contradiction to our\nchoice of F\u03bc not being maximal.\n\u2022 If |I| < \u221e: 0\u0304 = J(R/F\u03bc ) = \u2229i\u2208I (Gi /F\u03bc ) where R/F\u03bc is semiprimitive by\nprimality and the Razmyslov-Kemer-Braun theorem, and since R/F\u03bc is prime\n(of course in a prime ring finite intersections of nonzero ideals are nonzero),\nit follows that 0\u0304 must be a primitive ideal of R/F\u03bc .\n\u2022 If |I| = \u05d00 : actually in this case we shall see a claim also applicable to |I| < \u221e,\nso it is possible not to separate to two cases. {Gi /F\u03bc }i\u2208I are all the nonzero\nprime ideals of R/F\u03bc , each is maximal in R/F\u03bc (since each Gi is maximal in R).\nSo {Gi /F\u03bc }i\u2208I are all the nonzero primitive ideals of R/F\u03bc . Therefore, taking\n0\u0304 6= \u0233i \u2208 (Gi /F\u03bc ) yields a countable separating set for the nonzero primitive\nideals of R/F\u03bc . Since R/F\u03bc is PI, by Rowen's theorem Z(R/F\u03bc ) \u2229 R\u0304\u0233i R\u0304 6= 0\u0304,\nhence we may take 0\u0304 6= x\u0304i \u2208 Z(R/F\u03bc ) \u2229 R\u0304y \u0304i R\u0304 and get a countable separating\nset for the nonzero primitive ideals of R/F\u03bc with elements regular (any nonzero\nelement of the center of a prime ring is regular) and commuting with each\nother. Thus from Theorem 3.3 of [23] this separating set satisfies (4) in that\npaper. Hence we can use Proposition 3.2 there (with a little generalisation,\nas mentioned in Remark 1.12) and get that R/F\u03bc is primitive.\nTherefore each height n \u2212 1 prime must be maximal. But then obviously primes\nof height n cannot exist, hence kdim(R) \u2264 n \u2212 1, so by the induction hypothesis\nkdim(R) = 1.\nFinally, R is non-PI just infinite from Corollary 1.11.\n\u0003\n\n\f7\n\nRemark 1.14. If one reads carefully the proof of Proposition 1.13, one sees that\ninstead of \"affine over an uncountable field\", we could assume \"the usual dimensioncardinality hypothesis\". This is because:\n\u2022 \"(Notice: |A| \u2264 \u05d00 from Proposition 1.26)\": In Proposition 1.26 affinity is\nneeded, but the countability of the height 1 primes is not used in the proof.\n\u2022 \"We shall now see that P\u03b1 must be primitive, hence by Proposition 1.7 maximal\": In Proposition 1.7 affinity is not needed.\n\u2022 In Proposition 3.2 and in Theorem 3.3 of [23] affiniy is not needed, only\ndimk (R) < |k|.\n1.3. Nullstellensatz. Another property of an affine almost PI algebra can be obtained by using the Razmyslov-Kemer-Braun theorem [13, Theorem 2.57], which says\nthat every affine PI algebra has a nilpotent Jacobson radical.\nA Jacobson ring is a ring in which every prime factor ring is semiprimitive. A ring\nR has the radical property if the Jacobson radical of each factor ring of R is nil.\nEach Jacobson ring has the radical property, see [16, 9.1.2].\nProposition 1.15. Let R be an affine almost PI algebra. For every nonzero prime\nideal P , R/P is semiprimitive. Therefore, if R is semiprimitive, then it is a Jacobson\nring.\nProof. Let P be a nonzero prime ideal of R. R/P is an affine PI algebra, so by\nRazmyslov-Kemer-Braun theorem J(R/P ) is nilpotent. Primality of R/P implies\nJ(R/P ) = 0. The second part is obvious (remember that we have seen in Theorem\n1.1 that an almost PI algebra is prime).\n\u0003\nAn algebra R over a field k has the endomorphism property over k if, for each\nsimple R-module M, EndR (M) is algebraic over k.\nAn algebra R over a field k satisfies the Nullstellensatz over k if R has both the\nradical property and the endomorphism property.\nFrom Proposition 1.8(ii) we get the following proposition.\nProposition 1.16. If R is an affine almost PI algebra which is not primitive, then\neach simple R-module is finite dimensional over k. Therefore R has the endomorphism property.\nProof. Take a maximal left ideal L in R. Since we have assumed that R is not\nprimitive, core(L) 6= 0. Denote P = core(L). P is a nonzero primitive ideal in R\ntherefore, from Proposition 1.8(ii), P has finite codimension. From P = core(L) \u2286 L\nwe see L/P \u2286 R/P , hence (R/P )/(L/P ) \u223c\n= R/L is finite dimensional over k. Since\nany simple R-module is isomorphic to R/L where L is a maximal left ideal in R, we\nare done. Finally, R has the endomorphism property: Let M be a simple R-module.\nEndR (M) \u2286 Endk (M) and Endk (M) is finite dimensional over k (since M is finite\ndimensional over k), so obviously Endk (M) is algebraic over k. Hence EndR (M) is\nalso algebraic over k.\n\u0003\nProposition 1.16 tells us that if an affine almost PI algebra R has a maximal left\nideal L with dimk (R/L) = \u221e, then R is primitive.\nFrom Proposition 1.15 and Proposition 1.16 we get the following corollary. When\nk is uncountable, it is already known that any countably generated k-algebra satisfies\n\n\f8\n\nthe Nullstellensatz, see [16, 9.1.8]. Hence, the next corollary adds something new\nonly when |k| \u2264 \u05d00 .\nCorollary 1.17. If R is an affine almost PI algebra which is semiprimitive but not\nprimitive, then R satisfies the Nullstellensatz. More generally, it is enough to demand\nthat J(R) is nil (instead of J(R) = 0).\nProof. Obvious from Proposition 1.15 and Proposition 1.16. Also the more general\nclaim is obvious.\n\u0003\n1.4. Countable cofinal subset of ideals.\nDefinition 1.18. Fisher and Snider [9] have defined for a prime ring a countable\ncofinal subset of ideals as a countable collection of nonzero ideals, such that any\nnonzero ideal contains an ideal in that collection.\nDefinition 1.19. By a separating set S for the nonzero ideals of R we mean a set S\n(0 \u2208\n/ S) such that for each nonzero ideal I in R, I \u2229 S 6= \u2205.\nThe following property of an almost PI algebra (not necessarily affine) will be used\nmany times in this paper.\nProposition 1.20. If R is an almost PI algebra, then R has a countable cofinal\nsubset of ideals. Therefore R has a countable separating set for its nonzero ideals.\nProof. Define for every n, d \u2208 N Sn,d := ((sn )d )(R) the two sided ideal generated by\nthe set ((sn )d )(R) = {((sn )d )(r1 , . . . , rn )|ri \u2208 R} where sn is the standard polynomial\nof degree n. Each Sn,d is nonzero, since R is non-PI.\nNow take any 0 6= I \u22b3 R. R/I is PI, so it satisfies some power of a standard\npolynomial [16, Theorem 13.4.8], assume it to be (sn )d for some n, d \u2208 N.\n\u2200r \u0304i \u2208 R/I ((sn )d )(r \u03041 , . . . , r \u0304n ) = 0\u0304.\n\u2200ri \u2208 R ((sn )d )(r1 , . . . , rn ) + I = 0 + I,\n\u2200ri \u2208 R ((sn )d )(r1 , . . . , rn ) \u2208 I, hence ((sn )d )(R) \u2286 I, implying Sn,d \u2286 I.\nThat R has a countable separating set for its nonzero ideals follows at once: just\nchoose one nonzero element yn,d from each Sn,d , therefore {yn,d}n,d\u2208N is a countable\nseparating set.\n\u0003\nRemarks 1.21.\n(i) In an affine almost PI algebra there exists another countable\ncofinal subset of ideals, namely {Tn (R)}n\u2208N , where Tn (R) is the two sided ideal\ngenerated by the set tn (R) = {f (r1 , . . . , rm )|f \u2208 id(Mn (k)), ri \u2208 R}. Indeed;\nFirst, each Tn (R) is nonzero, since R is non-PI. Second, take any 0 6= I \u22b3 R.\nR/I is affine PI, so it satisfies all polynomial identities of Mn (k) for some n\n(since J(R/I) is nilpotent and [20, page 216] or [22, Theorem 6.3.16]):\n\u2200f = f (X1 , . . . , Xm ) \u2208 id(Mn (k)) \u2200r \u0304i \u2208 R/I f (r \u03041 , . . . , r \u0304m ) = 0\u0304. Then,\nfor every f = f (X1 , . . . , Xm ) \u2208 id(Mn (k)) and every ri \u2208 R, we have that\nf (r1 , . . . , rm ) + I = 0 + I, so, for every f = f (X1 , . . . , Xm ) \u2208 id(Mn (k)) and\nevery ri \u2208 R, we must have f (r1 ), . . . , rm ) \u2208 I, which means that tn (R) \u2286 I,\nhence Tn (R) \u2286 I.\n(ii) If a prime Goldie ring R has a separaring set S, then we can assume each\nelement in S is regular. This is because we can replace s \u2208 S by a regular\nelement x \u2208 RsR (RsR contains a regular element since it is a nonzero ideal\n\n\f9\n\nin a prime Goldie ring). Hence any Goldie almost PI algebra has a countable\nseparating set of regular elements.\nRemember that if R is any ring which satisfies ACC(semiprimes), then:\n(a) every semiprime ideal is a finite intersection of prime ideals,\n(b) there are only finitely many prime ideals minimal over any ideal.\n(see [18, Proposition 5.2.3 and Corollary 5.2.4]).\nUsing (b) and an idea from [23, Proposition 2.4] gives the following proposition. It\nis very important for the proofs of Theorem 2.4, Theorem 2.6 and Theorem 2.7.\nProposition 1.22. If R is an almost PI algebra satisfying ACC(semiprimes), then\nR has only countably many height 1 primes.\nProof. From proposition 1.20, R has a countable separating set for its nonzero ideals,\ndenote it S = {si }i\u2208N . For each Rsi R, let Pi1 , . . . , Pit(i) be those prime ideals of\nR minimal over Rsi R. Indeed, there are only finitely many such primes since we\nhave assumed that R satisfies ACC(semiprimes). Let \u03a6 = {Piu |i \u2208 N, 1 \u2264 u \u2264\nt(i), Ht(Piu ) = 1}. \u03a6 is of course a countable set of height 1 primes. We will see now\nthat every height 1 prime belongs to \u03a6: Take any height 1 prime Q. Since S is a\nseparating set, sj \u2208 Q for some j \u2208 N. Therefore Rsj R \u2286 Q. Q must be minimal\nover Rsj R from considerations of height (Q is of height 1). Thus Q \u2208 \u03a6.\n\u0003\nRemarks 1.23. (i) In the proof of Proposition 1.22 it is enough to have a countable\nseparating set for the nonzero height 1 prime ideals of R; However, from Proposition\n1.20, R has a countable separating set for all its nonzero ideals.\n(ii) If R is an almost PI algebra satisfying ACC(semiprimes), then any infinite\n(necessarily countable, from Proposition 1.22) intersection of height 1 primes is zero;\nOtherwise, there are height 1 primes {Qn }n\u2208N with \u2229Qn 6= 0. Since \u2229Qn is a\nsemiprime ideal, it must be a finite intersection of prime ideals, as was mentioned in\n(a) above. Thus there exist P1 , . . . , Pm nonzero primes such that P1 \u2229* * * \u2229Pm = \u2229Qn .\nBut this is impossible because then \u2200j \u2208 N: P1 * * * Pm \u2286 P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pm = \u2229Qn \u2286 Qj ,\nwhich implies {Pi }1\u2264i\u2264m \u2287 {Qn }, a contradiction.\nActually, one sees that in any prime algebra (not necessarily almost PI) which\nsatisfies ACC(semiprimes), any infinite (not necessarily countable) intersection of\nheight 1 primes is zero.\nFrom the above remarks we can generalize Proposition 1.22. Instead of an almost\nPI algebra we can take a prime non-PI algebra such that for every nonzero prime\nideal, its factor ring is PI (or even more generally: for every nonzero height 1 prime\nideal, its factor ring is PI. This is a generalisation if that algebra does not satisfy\nDCC(primes)).\nProposition 1.24. Let R be a prime non-PI ring such that:\n(i) For every nonzero prime ideal P , R/P is PI.\n(ii) R satisfies ACC(semiprimes).\nThen R has only countably many height 1 primes.\nMore generally, Instead of (i) we can assume: (i') For every nonzero height 1 prime\nP , R/P is PI, and still R has only countably many height 1 primes.\n\n\f10\n\nProof. (i) implies that R has a countable separating set for its nonzero prime ideals.\nIndeed, take a nonzero prime ideal P . R/P is PI, so it satisfies some power of\na standard polynomial, assume it to be (sn )d for some n, d \u2208 N. Hence Sn,d \u2286\nP , where Sn,d := (sn )d (R) the two sided ideal generated by the set (sn )d (R) =\n{(sn )d (r1 , . . . , rn )|ri \u2208 R}. Now just choose one nonzero element yn,d from each Sn,d\n(R is non-PI, so Sn,d 6= 0). Therefore {yn,d }n,d\u2208N is a countable separating set for\nthe nonzero prime ideals of R, rename it S = {si }i\u2208N . Reading carefully the proof of\nProposition 1.22 reveals that the same proof works here also, only now S = {si }i\u2208N\nis a countable separating set for the nonzero prime ideals.\nWhen assuming (i') instead of (i): Just add \"height 1\" where requiered.\n\u0003\nNow we will consider affine almost PI algebras.\nLemma 1.25. If R is an affine almost PI algebra, then R satisfies ACC(semiprimes).\nProof. Let 0 6= P \u03031 \u2282 P \u03032 \u2282 P \u03033 \u2282 * * * be an ascending chain of semiprime ideals\nin R. Then in R/P \u03031 we have P \u03032 /P \u03031 \u2282 P \u03033 /P \u03031 \u2282 * * * , which is an ascending chain\nof semiprime ideals. This is impossible, since R/P \u03031 is an affine PI algebra, and as\nsuch it must satisfy the ascending chain condition on semiprime ideals [18, Corollary\n5.2.2].\n\u0003\nThe following Proposition is what will actually be used in the proofs of Theorem\n2.4, Theorem 2.6, Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 2.9.\nProposition 1.26. If R is an affine almost PI algebra, then R has only countably\nmany height 1 primes.\nProof. From Lemma 1.25 R satisfies ACC(semiprimes). Now use Proposition 1.22.\n\u0003\n1.5. von Neumann regularity. Notice that affinity is not needed in the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 1.27. If an almost PI algebra R is von Neumann regular, then it is primitive.\nProof. R is an almost PI algebra, so it is prime by Theorem 1.1 and has a countable\ncofinal subset of ideals by Proposition 1.20. Now use Corollary 1.2 in [9].\n\u0003\n1.6. Algebraicity. Remember that von Neumann regularity implies semiprimitivity\n[21, 2.11.19(ii)]. It is then interesting to see what happens if instead of von Neumann\nregularity we only assume semiprimitivity. Since now it is a more general question, it\nseems reasonable to add another assumption to compensate for what was lost. Again\n[9] will help us.\nThe idea of the proof of the following theorem is taken from the proof of Farkas\nand Small's Theorem [8, Theorem 2.2].\nTheorem 1.28. Let k be any field and let R be an algebraic almost PI k-algebra.\nThen J(R) 6= 0 or R is primitive.\nProof. Assume that J(R) = 0. Therefore, each nil left ideal is zero. Hence every\nnonzero left ideal is not nil, so it has a non nilpotent element. By a remark of Rowen\n[23, page 324], every nonzero left ideal of R contains an idempotent different from\n\n\f11\n\n0,1. R is prime and has a countable cofinal subset of ideals. Then Theorem 1.1 in [9]\nimplies that R is primitive.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.29. Let k be any field and let R be a semiprimitive k-algebra. Assume\nthat the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) R/I is PI, for every nonzero ideal I in R.\n(ii) R is algebraic over k,\nThen R is PI or primitive.\nNotice that one may consider Corollary 1.29 interesting only when R is not prime\nGoldie (or when R is not a domain). Indeed, an algebraic prime Goldie algebra is\nsimple- an explanation is given in the beginning of section 2 (an algebraic domain is\na division algebra).\nProof. Assume that R is non-PI. Then, from (i), R is an almost PI algebra. So\nTheorem 1.28 implies that R is primitive.\n\u0003\nWe have already seen the following theorem before (Lemma 1.9). It is an immediate\nconsequence of a solution, for PI rings, to Kurosch problem:\nTheorem 1.30. If an affine almost PI k-algebra R is algebraic, then it is non-PI\njust infinite.\nProof. Let I be a nonzero ideal of R. R/I is an algebraic affine PI algebra, hence\nfinite dimensional [16, 13.8.9(ii)].\n\u0003\nIn Theorem 1.30 we have taken an algebraic affine almost PI algebra. Now we want\nto see what may make an affine almost PI algebra algebraic.\nProposition 1.31. Let k be an uncountable field and let R be an affine almost PI kalgebra. Assume that R has only countably many primitive ideals. Then R is algebraic\nover k or primitive.\nProof. The proof is actually Farkas and Small's proof [8, Theorem 2.2]. We only give\na sketch of it, since in section 2 and in section 3, detailed similar proofs will be given.\nAssume that R is not primitive. We must show that R is algebraic over k. Otherwise,\nthere exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R. Define two subsets of k, A and B, as in\nTheorem 3.1. Notice that:\n\u2022 In Theorem 3.1, non-PI implies that there are only countably many primitive\nideals, while here we assume that there are only countably many primitive\nideals.\n\u2022 There as well as here, the countability of B follows from the finite codimensionality of the nonzero primitive ideals. There the nonzero primitive ideals\nhas finite codimension since the algebra is just infinite, while here the nonzero\nprimitive ideals has finite codimension since the algebra is affine almost PI,\nsee Proposition 1.8(ii).\nFrom the same arguments as in Theorem 3.1, we get a contradiction (for some nonzero\nprimitive ideal Qi , x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi is, on the one hand, invertible in R/Qi , and on the\nother hand, belongs to a maximal left ideal of R/Qi ). Therefore, R is algebraic over\nk.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\n1.7. Boundedness. Let R be an affine almost PI algebra. For each ideal 0 6= I \u22b3\nR there exists n = n(I), which depends on I, such that J(R/I)n(I) = 0\u0304. This\nfollows from the Razmyslov-Kemer-Braun theorem [13] which says that every affine\nPI algebra has a nilpotent Jacobson radical. This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 1.32. A ring R is bounded, if there exists some d such that for every\n0 6= I \u22b3 R, J(R/I)d = 0\u0304.\nAny such d will be called a nilpotency-bound for R.\nAn affine almost PI algebra may or may not be bounded (when there exists no such\na d). Actually, boundedness of an affine almost PI algebra is a very strong condition,\nas the following theorem shows. A theorem of Passman and Temple or of Farkas,\nhelps us to prove it.\nTheorem 1.33. If an affine almost PI algebra R is bounded, then it is non-PI just\ninfinite.\nProof. Take 0 6= I \u22b3 R. We must show that dimk (R/I) < \u221e.\nLet d be a nilpotency-bound for R. Theorem 3.3 in Passman and Temple [17] gives\nwhat we want, taking their A to be our R/I and their d to be our bound d.\nTheorem 3.3 in [17] says the following: \"Let A be an affine k algebra satisfying\na polynomial identity, and let d be a fixed integer. If the nil radical of every finite\ndimensional homomorphic image of A has nilpotence degree at most d, then A itself\nis finite dimensional\".\nIndeed our R/I is affine PI. The nil radical of every homomorphic image of R/I\nhas nilpotence degree at most d. This is because the nil radical is contained in the\nJacobson radical, and the Jacobson radical has nilpotence degree at most d, as can\neasily be seen: For 0 6= I \u2286 T \u22b3 R (R/I)/(T /I) \u223c\n=\n= R/T \u21d2 J((R/I)/(T /I)) \u223c\nd \u223c\nd\nd\nJ(R/T ) \u21d2 J((R/I)/(T /I)) = J(R/T ) = 0\u0304 \u21d2 J((R/I)/(T /I)) = 0\u0304\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.33 shows that if an affine almost PI algebra has a nonzero ideal with\ninfinite codimension, then it cannot be bounded. This shows that boundedness is not\na property that we should expect from an affine almost PI algebra to have.\nCorollary 1.34. If an affine almost PI algebra R is bounded semiprimitive and the\nbase field is uncountable, then R is primitive.\nProof. R is non-PI just infinite from Theorem 1.33. Now use Theorem 2.2 in [8]\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 1.35. If an affine almost PI algebra R is bounded, then its center, Z(R),\nis a field.\nIf, in addition, R is not simple, then dimk Z(R) < \u221e.\nProof. Since R is non-PI just infinite, we can use Proposition 2.3 in [4].\n\n\u0003\n\nWe bring now another proof how boundedness of R implies Z(R) is a field, but with\nno information about dimk Z(R). We include it here, because it shows that for every\nnonzero prime P , Z(R/P ) also a field. However, this is already known, since R/P\nis simple (from Theorem 1.33, R is just infinite, so R/P is prime finite dimensional,\nhence simple).\nTheorem 1.36. If an affine almost PI algebra R is bounded, then Z(R) is a field.\nMoreover, for every nonzero prime P , Z(R/P ) is also a field.\n\n\f13\n\nProof. The following is an argument applicable to any prime algebra S whose homomorphic images (except, maybe, S/0) has a nilpotent Jacobson radical and there\nexists a bound of nilpotency. We will prove that for such algebra S, its center is a\nfield.\nSince S is prime, each 0 6= z \u2208 Z(S) is regular. Take 0 6= z \u2208 Z(S). It is enough\nto prove that z has an inverse in S. Indeed, assume that y \u2208 S s.t. zy = yz = 1.\nFor every r \u2208 S, z(yr \u2212 ry) = z(yr) \u2212 z(ry) = (zy)r \u2212 r(zy) = 1r \u2212 r1 = 0, so by\nregularity of z we have yr \u2212 ry = 0, hence y \u2208 Z(S).\n\u2022 Step 1: For each n \u2265 1 we have z + Sz n \u2208 J(S/Sz n ): Fix n. Remember\nJ(S/Sz n ) = J(S\u0304) = {w\u0304 \u2208 S\u0304| for every r\u0304 \u2208 S\u0304 : 1\u0304 + r\u0304 w\u0304 is left invertible}.\nLet us see why for every r\u0304 \u2208 S\u0304: 1\u0304 + r\u0304z\u0304 is left invertible. Take r\u0304 \u2208 S\u0304.\nDefine yr := 1 \u2212 rz + r 2 z 2 \u2212 . . . \u00b1 r n\u22121 z n\u22121 . y \u0304r (1\u0304 + r\u0304z\u0304) = yr (1 + rz) =\n(1 \u2212 rz + r 2 z 2 \u2212 . . . \u00b1 r n\u22121 z n\u22121 )(1 + rz) = 1 \u00b1 r n z n = 1\u0304, so y \u0304r is the left inverse of 1\u0304 + r\u0304z\u0304. (Notice that for n = 1: 1\u0304 + r\u0304z\u0304 = 1 + rz = 1\u0304, so it is trivial\nthat it has a left inverse, namely itself. Actually , we will need the above only\nin case n > 1).\n\u2022 Step 2: Assume d \u2265 1 is a bound of nilpotency for S and take m > d. From\nstep 1, in particular for that m: z + Sz m \u2208 J(S/Sz m ). Then, z d + Sz m =\n(z + Sz m )d \u2208 J(S/Sz m )d = 0\u0304 = 0 + Sz m , so z d \u2208 Sz m . Hence, z d = rz m for\nsome r \u2208 S, and we have (1 \u2212 rz m\u2212d )z d = z d \u2212 rz m = 0. Finally, since z is\nregular 1 \u2212 rz m\u2212d = 0, so rz m\u2212d = 1 and z is invertible in S.\nFor the second argument: Take a nonzero prime ideal P . R/P has the property\nthat each of its homomorphic images has nilpotent Jacobson radical and there exists\na bound of nilpotency (the bound for R holds for R/P ), so we can use the above\nargument to show that Z(R/P ) is a field.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.37. If an affine almost PI algebra R is bounded, then each nonzero\nprime ideal is maximal.\nProof. Actually, this follows immediately from Theorem 1.33, which says that R is just\ninfinite. Indeed, if P is a nonzero prime ideal, then R/P is prime finite dimensional,\nhence simple.\nLet us present another argument: Let P be any nonzero prime ideal in R. From\nTheorem 1.36, Z(R/P ) is a field. Since R/P is prime PI, it follows from Rowen's\nTheorem that R/P is simple, so P is maximal.\n\u0003\nA somewhat similar idea is that of degree-boundedness:\nDefinition 1.38. An almost PI algebra (not necessarily affine) is degree-bounded, if\nthere exists some d such that for every 0 6= I \u22b3 R, R/I satisfies a polynomial identity\nof degree d. Any such d will be called a degree-bound for R\nHowever, degree-boundedness seems too strong to require, as can, for example, be\nseen from the following proposition.\nProposition 1.39. Let R be an almost PI algebra. If R is degree-bounded and\nsemiprimitive, then it is primitive.\nProof. Otherwise, 0 is not primitive, so J(R)\nQ = \u2229Q\u03bb where each Q\u03bb is a nonzero\nprimitive ideal. But J(R) = 0, hence R \u0592\u2192 R/Q\u03bb , a contradiction (reason: if d is a\n\n\f14\n\nQ\ndegree-bound for R, then R/Q\u03bb satisfies a polynomial identity of degree d, hence\nR satisfies a polynomial identity of degree d, which is impossible).\n\u0003\n1.8. Stably almost PI. This subsection is based on [4]. Notice that affinity is not\nalways needed. Luckily, some (but not all) of the theorems in [4] which deals with a\nnon-PI just infinite algebra are still true if we take an almost PI algebra instead.\nDefinition 1.40. Let R be an almost PI algebra over a field k. R is stably almost\nPI if the K-algebra R \u2297k K is an almost PI algebra, for every field extension K/k.\nFrom now on, let C(R) denote the extended center of R and Z(R) denote the center\nof R.\nTheorem 1.41. Let R be an almost PI algebra over an algebraically closed field k\nwith Z(R) = k. Then R is stably almost PI \u21d4 R is centrally closed (this means\nC(R) = Z(R)).\nProof. Reading carefully the proof of Theorem 3.4 in [4] reveals that their proof also\nworks here. Of course minor changes must be done in their proof: When R is simple\nit is centrally closed. R is stably almost PI since R \u2297k K is simple for every field\nextension K/k, hence almost PI.\nIn the notations of [4] (the only difference in notations is that our R is their A):\n(\u21d0) When R is centrally closed J is still a nonzero ideal of R. R/J is PI (since R\nis almost PI) and K is PI, therefore, from [10, Theorem 2.4], (R/J) \u2297k K is PI. Since\nonto\n(R \u2297k K)/I \u2190 (R \u2297k K)/(J \u2297k K) \u223c\n= (R/J) \u2297k K, we see that (R \u2297k K)/I is PI (as\na homomorphic image of a PI ring).\n(\u21d2) Supposing R is stably almost PI but not centrally closed, all the arguments in\n[4] are valid here untill the last three lines: R embeds in B/(a + tb) (B := R \u2297k k(t)).\nR is stably almost PI so B/(a + tb) is PI. Thus, R is PI, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nAs in [4], one gets the following propositions:\nProposition 1.42. Let R be an almost PI k-algebra. Then R is stably almost PI \u21d4\nthe C(R)-algebra R \u2297k C(R) is almost PI.\nProof. See Proposition 3.5 in [4].\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 1.43. Let R be a primitive almost PI k-algebra, where k is an algebraically closed field. If R satisfies the Nullstellensatz, then R is stably almost PI.\nProof. See Proposition 4.3 in [4].\n\n\u0003\n\nNext we consider countably generated almost PI algebras.\nThe following proposition is immediate from a theorem of Rowen and Small.\nProposition 1.44. Let R be a countably generated almost PI k-algebra. If R is\nGoldie and k is uncountable, then C(R) is algebraic over k.\nProof. Use Theorem 1 in [24], which says the following: \"Suppose R is a prime Goldie\nalgebra over a field k. If dimk (R) < |k|, and the nonzero prime ideals of R have a\nseparating set of some cardinality \u03b3 < |k|, then C(R) is algebraic over k\". Of course\nour R is prime (Theorem 1.1), dimk (R) = \u05d00 < |k|, and the nonzero (prime) ideals\nof R have a separating set of cardinality \u03b3 = \u05d00 < |k| (Proposition 1.20).\n\u0003\n\n\f15\n\nWe can remove the assumption that R is Goldie and still conclude that C(R) is\nalgebraic over k. Actually more can be said:\nProposition 1.45. Let R be a countably generated almost PI k-algebra. Then C(R)\nis a countable dimensional field extension of k. Therefore, if k is uncountable, then\nC(R) is algebraic over k.\nProof. From Proposition 6.2 and Remark 6.3 in [4], C(R) is a countable dimensional\nfield extension of k. If k is uncountable, Amitsur's trick yields that C(R) is algebraic\nover k (remember that C(R) is a field, hence for each x \u2208 C(R) \u2212 k, {x \u2212 \u03bb1}\u03bb\u2208k are\nall invertible, etc.).\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.46. Let R be a countably generated almost PI k-algebra and let k be an\nuncountable algebraically closed field. Then R is stably almost PI.\nProof. From Proposition 1.45, C(R) is algebraic over k. But k is algebraically closed,\nhence C(R) = k. Therefore C(R) = Z(R) = k, so R is centrally closed. Theorem\n1.41 shows that R is stably almost PI.\n\u0003\nThe uncountable hypothesis in Corollary 1.46 is necessary, since there exists an\naffine almost PI algebra over a countable algebraically closed field k which is not\nstably almost PI; just take the algebra A from the example in [4]. Indeed, the algebra\nA is non-PI just infinite affine over a countable algebraically closed field k and it is\nnot centrally closed. Hence A is not stably almost PI by Theorem 1.41.\nNotice that Proposition 1.44, Proposition 1.45 and Corollary 1.46 can be generalised\nto \"the usual dimension-cardinality hypothesis\":\nProposition 1.47 (generalised Proposition 1.44). Let R be an almost PI k-algebra\nwith dimk (R) < |k|. If R is Goldie, then C(R) is algebraic over k.\nProof. Use Theorem 1 in [24]. Observe that indeed, the nonzero (prime) ideals of R\nhave a separating set of cardinality \u03b3 = \u05d00 \u2264 dimk (R) < |k| (Proposition 1.20). \u0003\nAgain, we can remove the assumption that R is Goldie and still conclude that C(R)\nis algebraic over k:\nProposition 1.48 (generalised Proposition 1.45). Let R be an almost PI k-algebra.\nIf dimk (R) < |k|, then C(R) is algebraic over k.\nProof. Use Proposition 6.2 in [4] to get dimk C(R) \u2264 dimk (R). If dimk (R) < |k|, then\ndimk C(R) \u2264 dimk (R) < |k| and Amitsur's trick implies that C(R) is algebraic over\nk.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.49 (generalised Corollary 1.46). Let R be an almost PI k-algebra. If\ndimk (R) < |k| and k is an algebraically closed field, then R is stably almost PI.\nProof. From Proposition 1.48, C(R) is algebraic over k. But k is algebraically closed,\nhence C(R) = k. Therefore C(R) = Z(R) = k, so R is centrally closed. Theorem\n1.41 shows that R is stably almost PI.\n\u0003\nFinally, Proposition 2.3 in [4] says the following: \"Let A be a non-PI just infinite\nk-algebra that is not simple. Then Z(A) is a finite dimensional field extension of k\".\nIn the proof there, after knowing that Z(A) is a field, non-simplicity of A guarantees\nthat dimk (Z(A)) < \u221e.\n\n\f16\n\nFor an almost PI algebra we have a similar result, but the proof is different. Also\nnotice that for an almost PI algebra we assume, in addition, that dimk (R) < |k|.\nProposition 1.50. Let R be an almost PI k-algebra with dimk (R) < |k|. Then Z(R)\nis a field extension of k.\nIf R has a nonzero proper ideal which has finite codimension (for example: if R is\naffine and not simple), then Z(R) is a finite dimensional field extension of k.\nProof. Since R is an almost PI k-algebra with dimk (R) < |k|, C(R) is algebraic over k\n(Proposition 1.48); hence Z(R) \u2286 C(R) is algebraic over k. Primality of R (Theorem\n1.1) implies Z(R) is a domain. Therefore, Z(R) is a field.\nLet I be a nonzero proper ideal of R with dimk (R/I) < \u221e. Since Z(R) is a field,\nI \u2229 Z(R) = 0. Therefore, the natural projection R \u2212\u2192 R/I induces an injection\nZ(R) \u0592\u2192 R/I, so dimk Z(R) \u2264 dimk (R/I) < \u221e.\nIn the special case where R is affine and not simple: From Zorn's Lemma, there\nexists a maximal ideal Q. Q is nonzero (otherwise, R would be simple). As an affine\nalmost PI algebra dimk (R/Q) < \u221e (remember Proposition 1.8(ii)).\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.51. Let R be an almost PI k-algebra with dimk (R) < |k| and k is\nalgebraically closed. If R has a nonzero proper ideal which has finite codimension (for\nexample: if R is affine and not simple), then R is central (Z(R) = k).\nProof. Immediate from the above proposition.\n\n\u0003\n\n2. An affine prime Goldie algebra with GK dimension <3 over an\nuncountable field\nLet R be an affine prime Goldie k-algebra with GK dimension < 3, where k is an\nuncountable field. We want to know when such an algebra is PI or primitive.\nIf such an R is algebraic, then it is simple. This is because any algebraic prime\nGoldie algebra is simple; Indeed, in a prime Goldie algebra each nonzero two sided\nideal contains a regular element. This regular element is algebraic, hence invertible\n(actually, we have already seen that explanation in Corollary 1.3(ii)).\nIf such an R is von Neumann regular, then it is simple. Indeed, a Goldie von\nNeumann regular algebra is Artinian, see [11, Corollary 2.16], and a prime Artinian\nalgebra is simple, see [21, 2.3.9].\nIn the following subsections we will bring some partial answers to Small's question,\nnamely, that a non-PI such R is primitive when:\n(1) There exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R, such that x+P \u2208 R/P is algebraic\nover k, for every prime ideal P with co-GK 1, and k is algebraically closed.\n(2) There exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R, such that x+P \u2208 R/P is algebraic\nover k, for every completely prime ideal P with co-GK 1, and x + P \u2208 R/P\nis nilpotent, for every prime ideal P with co-GK 1, which is not completely\nprime.\n(3) There exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R, such that x+P \u2208 R/P is algebraic\nover k, for every prime ideal P with co-GK 1, and also for every such prime\nP , one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\n\u2013 the polynomial ring Z(R/P )[t] has the property (*) 2.8.\n\u2013 the center of the classical (Goldie) ring of quotients of R/P , Z(Q(R/P )),\nis isomorphic to k(X).\n\n\f17\n\nFirst we give two easy lemmas.\nLemma 2.1. Let R be a prime Goldie k-algebra with dimk (R) < |k|. Then R is\nsemiprimitive.\nProof. dimk (R) < |k| implies J(R) is algebraic over k (use Amitsur's trick). Prime\nGoldie implies that each nonzero two sided ideal contains a regular element.\nHence, if J(R) 6= 0, then J(R) contains a regular element, x. That x is also\nalgebraic over k. Therefore, x is invertible, which is impossible.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.2. Let R be an affine prime Goldie (non-simple) non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. Then\n(a) R is an almost PI algebra.\n(b) R has only countably many height 1 primes.\n(c) a nonzero prime ideal P can be one of the following three kinds:\n(1) First kind: Ht(P ) = 2, GKdim(R/P ) = 0: P is necessarily maximal.\n(2) Second kind: Ht(P ) = 1, GKdim(R/P ) = 0: P is necessarily maximal.\n(3) Third kind: Ht(P ) = 1, GKdim(R/P ) = 1: P is necessarily not primitive.\nProof.\n\n(a) Take a nonzero ideal I of R. Since R is prime Goldie I contains\na regular element. Therefore, from [14, Proposition 3.15], GKdim(R/I) \u2264\nGKdim(R) \u2212 1. Hence, from Bergman's gap theorem [14, Theorem 2.5],\nGKdim(R/I) \u2208 {0, 1}, so R/I is PI (use [25]).\n(b) Use (a) and Proposition 1.26.\n(c) This follows from Corollary 3.16 in [14] which says: \"Let A be a k-algebra\nwhose prime factor rings are right Goldie. If P is a prime ideal of A, then\nGKdim(A) \u2265 GKdim(A/P ) + Ht(P )\". Indeed we can use that corollary since;\n(i) from (a) R is an almost PI algebra, hence prime (Theorem 1.1) and we\nhave assumed that R is Goldie. (ii) a prime PI ring is Goldie ([16, 13.6.6(i)]).\nLet P be a prime of the first or of the second kind. Then R/P as a prime\nfinite dimensional algebra is simple, so P is maximal. Let P be a prime of the\nthird kind. P is necessarily not primitive; otherwise, as a nonzero primitive\nideal in an affine almost PI algebra, it must have finite codimension (see 1.8),\na contradiction.\n\u0003\n\nNotice that as a corollary to Lemma 2.2, one gets Lemma 2.8 of Bell's paper [6]\nwhich says the following: \"Let k be an uncountable field and let A be a finitely generated prime Goldie k-algebra of GK dimension two that does not satisfy a polynomial\nidentity. Then A has at most countably many height one prime ideals Q with the\nproperty that A/Q is finite dimensional as a k vector space\". Indeed, from Lemma\n2.2(b), A has only countably many height 1 primes. Also notice that Lemma 2.2(b)\ntells us a little more; not only that there are only countably many height 1 primes\nwith finite codimension, but also that there are only countably many height 1 primes\nwith infinite codimension. This fact is crucial for the proof of Theorem 2.6 and for\nthe proof of Theorem 2.7. Bell's lemma is enough for Theorem 2.4, since there we\nassume that there are only finitely many height 1 primes with infinite codimension.\nAnother corollary is the following, which will be used in the third section.\n\n\f18\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let R be as in Lemma 2.2. If R has a third kind prime, then there\nare uncountably many first kind primes.\nProof. Otherwise, there are only countably many first kind primes. Hence, for a\nthird kind prime P there are only countably many first kind primes which contain it,\ndenote them {Q\u0303i }i\u2208I where |I| \u2264 \u05d00 . Obviously, Spec(R/P ) = {0\u0304}\u222a{(Q\u0303i /P )}i\u2208I with\neach Q\u0303i /P a maximal ideal. So R/P has a countable separating set for its nonzero\nprimitive ideals; just take any nonzero xi \u2208 Q\u0303i /P . Actually, since R/P is prime PI,\nwe can choose nonzero yi \u2208 Q\u0303i /P \u2229 Z(R/P ). But then, a theorem of Rowen [23,\nProposition 3.2] implies that R/P is primitive, a contradiction (P , as a third kind\nprime, is necessarily not primitive).\n\u0003\n2.1. There are only finitely many prime ideals with co-GK 1. Let R be an\naffine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3, where k is\nan uncountable field. One can ask what happens in the special case when R has only\nfinitely many prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1 (since such primes are of height\n1, the above Lemma 2.2(b) shows that there are only countably many of them). The\nanswer is: R must be primitive. This answer is already known and brought in Bell's\npaper [6, page 832]. However, we bring its proof now.\nTheorem 2.4. Let R be an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. Asuume that R has only finitely\nmany prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1. Then R is primitive.\nProof. Lemma 2.2 tells us that R can have three kinds of nonzero primes; we shall call\nthem primes of the first, second and third kind, as in Lemma 2.2. So our assumption\nhere is that R has only finitely many third kind primes.\nFirst option: There are no third kind primes. Since there are no third kind primes, it\nfollows that there are no first kind primes (a first kind prime must contain a third kind\nprime, but there are no third kind primes). So, Spec(R) = {0, second kind primes}.\nNow we can apply [7, Corollary 1] which says that if in an affine infinite dimensional\nalgebra each nonzero prime ideal has finite codimension, then the algebra is just\ninfinite, and get that R is just infinite. From Lemma 2.1 our R is semiprimitive,\nso from Farkas and Small's theorem [8, Theorem 2.2] (which says that an affine\nsemiprimitive just infinite algebra over an uncountable field is PI or primitive), it\nfollows that R is primitive.\nSecond option: There is at least one third kind prime. By assumption, there are\nonly finitely many third kind primes, denote them {P1 , . . . , Pd }. Denote the first\nkind primes by T\u0303 = {Q \u0303\u03c6 }\u03c6\u2208\u03a6 (From Corollary 2.3 |\u03a6| > \u05d00 ). Denote the second kind\nprimes by T = {Qi }i\u2208M . From Lemma 2.2(b) |M| \u2264 \u05d00 .\n(a) |M| < \u05d00 : Then it is immediate that R is primitive;\nOtherwise, 0 = J(R) = (\u2229Q \u0303\u03c6 ) \u2229 (\u2229Qi ) \u2287 (P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd ) \u2229 (\u2229Qi ) 6= 0, where\n(P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd ) \u2229 (\u2229Qi ) 6= 0 since it is a finite intersection of nonzero ideals in a prime\nring, a contradiction. So 0 is a primitive ideal of R.\n(b) |M| = \u05d00 : The nonzero primitives are exactly the primes of the second and of\nthe first kind: T \u222a T\u0303 = {Qi }i\u2208M \u222a {Q \u0303\u03c6 }\u03c6\u2208\u03a6 .\nR is prime so P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd 6= 0. As a nonzero two sided ideal of a prime Goldie\nring, P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd contains a regular element, call it y. This y is not algebraic over k\n\n\f19\n\n(Otherwise, y is regular and algebraic, hence invertible. But then P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd = R,\na contradiction).\nDefine two countable subsets of k:\nA := {\u03b1 \u2208 k| y \u2212 \u03b1 is left invertible in R}: Indeed, from Amitsur's trick A is\ncountable (y is non-algebraic).\nB := {\u03b2 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 M such that y \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi \u2208 R/Qi\nis not invertible in R/Qi }: Indeed, \u2200i \u2208 M R/Qi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k).\nTherefore, there exists only finitely many \u03b2 \u2208 k (=the roots of the characteristic\npolynomial of y +Qi \u2208 R/Oi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k)) such that y \u2212\u03b2 +Qi =\n(y + Qi ) \u2212 (\u03b2 + Qi ) is not invertible in R/Qi , denote them B(i) = {\u03b2(i)1 , . . . , \u03b2(i)mi }.\nThen B = \u222ai\u2208M B(i), which is countable.\nNext, define E := k \u2212 (A \u222a B). E is uncountable.\nTake any nonzero \u03bb \u2208 E.\ny \u2212 \u03bb is not left invertible in R (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ A). Hence R(y \u2212 \u03bb) ( R, so there exists\na maximal left ideal L such that R(y \u2212 \u03bb) \u2286 L. annR (R/L) is a primitive ideal of R.\nThere are two options for annR (R/L):\n(I) annR (R/L) = 0. Then R is primitive.\n(II) annR (R/L) 6= 0. Hence annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 .\nWe shall now see that annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 is impossible:\n(1) annR (R/L) \u2208 T : So annR (R/L) = Qi for some i \u2208 M.\nQi = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We have an impossible situation: On\nthe one hand, y \u2212 \u03bb + Qi is invertible in R/Qi (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ B). On the\nother hand, y \u2212 \u03bb + Qi \u2208 L/Qi \u2286 R/Qi , where L/Qi is a maximal left\nideal of R/Qi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T cannot be true.\n(2) annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303 : So annR (R/L) = Q \u0303\u03c6 for some \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. There exists\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 d such that Pj ( Q \u0303\u03c6 = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We have an\nimpossible situation: On the one hand, y \u2212 \u03bb + Pj is invertible in R/Pj :\ny \u2212\u03bb+Pj = (y +Pj )+(\u2212\u03bb+Pj ) = (0+Pj )+(\u2212\u03bb+Pj ) = \u2212\u03bb+Pj (we have\ntaken y \u2208 P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd \u2286 Pj ). On the other hand, y \u2212 \u03bb + Pj \u2208 L/Pj \u2286\nR/Pj , where L/Pj is a maximal left ideal of R/Pj . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303\ncannot be true.\nHence only (I) is possible, so R is primitive.\n\u0003\nAs a special case of Theorem 2.4 consider the following algebra. Remember that\nan ideal P in a ring R is completely prime, if R/P is a domain.\nCorollary 2.5. Let R be an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable algebraically closed field. Assume that\nevery prime ideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1 is completely prime. Then R is primitive.\nProof. From Lemma 2.2 R has only countably many primes P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1.\nThere are two options:\n(i) R has only finitely many primes with co-GK 1.\n(ii) R has countably many (infinite) primes with co-GK 1. But this option is\nimpossible: An affine domain with GK dimension 1 over an algebraically\nclosed field must be commutative (this claim is a consequence of a theorem\nof Small and Warfield [26] and a theorem of Tsen). Hence, for every prime\n\n\f20\n\nideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, R/P is commutative. From Remarks 1.23\nand Lemma 1.25, the intersection of those primes is zero. But then R is\ncommutative, a contradiction (R is non-PI).\nTherefore, only option (i) is possible. Now Theorem 2.4 implies that R is primitive.\n\u0003\n2.2. There exists a non-algebraic element with algebraic images. Continue\nto assume that R is an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with GK\ndimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field.\nIn the following theorem 2.6, we show that R is primitive, if, in addition:\n\u2022 k is algebraically closed.\n\u2022 R has a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R such that for every prime ideal P with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1, x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k.\nIf R has only finitely many prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, then R is primitive\neven without the assumptions that k is algebraically closed and that R has a nonalgebraic element x such that for every prime ideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, x+P \u2208\nR/P is algebraic over k, as was proved in Theorem 2.4. So if that is the case, then\nwe are done.\nTherefore, our assumptions that k is algebraically closed and that R has such a\nspecial element are crucial when there are countably many (infinite) such primes.\nNotice:\n(1) When R has only finitely many prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, then\nthere exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R such that for every prime ideal P\nwith GKdim(R/P ) = 1, x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k: (If R has no such\nprimes, then R is just infinite, this was explained in the beginning of the proof\nof Theorem 2.4, in First option, and then R is primitive). Denote the primes\nwith co-GK 1 by {P1 , . . . , Pd }. Since R is prime Goldie, there exists a regular\nelement x \u2208 P1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Pd which is necessarily non-algebraic. Obviously, for\nevery 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d, x + Pj = 0 + Pj is algebraic over k.\nBut if R has infinitely many prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1 (necessarily countably many such primes, see Lemma 2.2(b)), then it seems to be\nyet unknown if R must have such a special non-algebraic element x.\n(2) In general, there exist non-algebraic algebras having a non-algebraic element\nwhose image in every nonzero prime is algebraic. For example: k[X] or any\nnon-algebraic just infinite algebra. Indeed, if x is a non-algebraic element in a\njust infinite algebra, then for every nonzero two sided ideal I (prime or not),\nx + I \u2208 R/I is algebraic over k. (R/I is finite dimensional, therefore every\nelement in R/I is algebraic, in particular x + I).\n(3) We could have imposed a more restrictive assumption than the assumption\nthat R has a non-algebraic element x such that for every prime ideal P with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1, x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k, namely that R is an\nalmost algebraic algebra.\nBy definition, an almost algebraic algebra is an algebra R over a field k\nwhich is non-algebraic over k, but R/I is algebraic over k, for every nonzero\ntwo sided ideal I of R. Examples of an almost algebraic algebra are k[X] or\nany non-algebraic just infinite algebra.\n\n\f21\n\nAn almost algebraic algebra R satisfies the above assumption: R is nonalgebraic over k; hence there exists a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R. For every\nnonzero two sided ideal I of R, R/I is algebraic over k, so, in particular,\nx + I \u2208 R/I is algebraic.\n(One can easily show that an almost algebraic algebra R is prime: Let\nx \u2208 R be non-algebraic. If R is not prime, then there exist A, B nonzero\nideals such that AB = 0. But, R/A is algebraic, so f (x + A) = 0 + A for\nsome f (t) \u2208 k[t], implying f (x) \u2208 A. Similarly, g(x) \u2208 B for some g(t) \u2208 k[t].\nTherefore, (f g)(x) = f (x)g(x) \u2208 AB = 0, a contradiction to our choice of a\nnon-algebraic x).\nHowever, an affine almost PI algebra R which is also almost algebraic is just\ninfinite; Indeed, for every nonzero two sided ideal I of R, R/I is an algebraic\naffine PI algebra, hence finite dimensional (Kurosch problem for PI, see [16,\n13.8.9(2)]).\nTheorem 2.6. Let k be an uncountable algebraically closed field and let R be an\naffine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3. If R has a\nnon-algebraic element x such that x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k, for every prime\nideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, then R is primitive.\nProof. If there are only finitely many primes with co-GK 1, then we are done.\nSo assume that there are infinitely many such primes (necessarily countably many).\nDenote them by {Pi }i\u2208N (third kind primes). Denote the first kind primes by T\u0303 =\n{Q \u0303\u03c6 }\u03c6\u2208\u03a6 . Denote the second kind primes by T = {Qi }i\u2208M . From Lemma 2.2(b)\n|M| \u2264 \u05d00 . Define three countable subsets of k.\nA := {\u03b1 \u2208 k| x \u2212 \u03b1 is left invertible in R}: Indeed, from Amitsur's trick A is\ncountable (By assumption, x is non-algebraic).\nB := {\u03b2 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 M such that x \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi \u2208 R/Qi\nis not invertible in R/Qi }: Indeed, \u2200i \u2208 M R/Qi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k).\nTherefore, there exists only finitely many \u03b2 \u2208 k (=the roots of the characteristic\npolynomial of x+Qi \u2208 R/Oi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k)) such that x\u2212\u03b2 +Qi =\n(x + Qi ) \u2212 (\u03b2 + Qi ) is not invertible in R/Qi , denote them B(i) = {\u03b2(i)1 , . . . , \u03b2(i)mi }.\nThen B = \u222ai\u2208M B(i), which is countable.\nC := {\u03b3 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 N such that x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi \u2208 R/Pi\nis not invertible in R/Pi }: Indeed, \u2200i \u2208 N, R/Pi is a prime PI algebra, hence can be\nembedded in a matrix ring over a field extension of k: R/Pi \u0592\u2192 Mni (Li ), where Li is\na field extension of k.\nWe have assumed that x + Pi \u2208 R/Pi is algebraic over k, so let fi (t) \u2208 k[t] be\n\u03c1i\nsuch that fi (x + Pi ) = 0 + Pi . Now think of x + Pi \u2208 R/Pi \u0592\u2192 Mni (Li ) as a matrix\nover Li . Obviously, fi (\u03c1i (x + Pi )) = \u03c1i ((fi (x + Pi )) = \u03c1i (0 + Pi ) = 0. Hence, the\nminimal polynomial of \u03c1i (x + Pi ), call it mi (t) \u2208 Li [t], divides fi (t). Remember\nwe have assumed that k is algebraically closed, so clearly mi (t) \u2208 k[t]. But then\nthe characteristic polynomial of \u03c1i (x + Pi ), call it ci (t) \u2208 Li [t] must also be over k,\nci (t) \u2208 k[t]. Let C(i) = {\u03b3(i)1 , . . . , \u03b3(i)mi } be the roots of ci (t) (of course, C(i) \u2282 k).\nTherefore, for any \u03b3 \u2208 k \u2212 C(i), x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi = (x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi ) is invertible in\nR/Pi ; Indeed, x + Pi algebraic over k implies that x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi = (x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi ) is\nalgebraic over k (this trivial claim is obviously true for any \u03b3 \u2208 k, but immediately\nwe will need the particular choice of \u03b3 \u2208 k \u2212 C(i)). x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi = (x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi )\n\n\f22\n\nalgebraic over k implies that the characteristic polynomial of \u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ) is over k,\ncall it ci,\u03b3 (t) (of course, the argument is exactly as the argument for ci (t) to be over\nk).\nSo, let ci,\u03b3 (t) = (\u22121)ni tni + bni \u22121 tni \u22121 + . . . + b1 t + b0 with bni \u22121 , . . . , b1 , b0 \u2208 k.\nFrom Cayley-Hamilton theorem, ci,\u03b3 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )) = 0: (*) (\u22121)ni (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 +\nPi ))ni + bni \u22121 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ))ni \u22121 + . . . + b1 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )) + b0 = 0. Of course,\nb0 = det(\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )).\nNow, since \u03b3 \u2208 k is not a root of ci (t), ci (\u03b3) \u2208 k \u2212 0. So, k \u2212 0 \u220b ci (\u03b3) =\ndet(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 \u03b3I) = det(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 \u03c1i (\u03b3 + Pi )) = (det(\u03c1i ((x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi )) =\ndet(\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )) = b0 .\nTherefore, (*) shows that ((\u2212b0 )\u22121 )((\u22121)ni (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ))ni \u22121 + bni \u22121 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 +\nPi ))ni \u22122 + . . . + b1 I)(\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )) = I, so the inverse of \u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ) is\n((\u2212b0 )\u22121 )((\u22121)ni (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ))ni \u22121 + bni \u22121 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ))ni \u22122 + . . . + b1 I).\nFrom this we can conclude that in R/Pi , x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi is invertible with inverse\n((\u2212b0 )\u22121 )((\u22121)ni (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )ni \u22121 + bni \u22121 (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )ni \u22122 + . . . + b1 1) \u2208 R/Pi (we use\nthe fact that \u03c1i is injective).\nOf course, for \u03b3 \u2208 C(i): 0 = ci (\u03b3) = det(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 \u03b3I) = det(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 \u03c1i (\u03b3 +\nPi )) = (det(\u03c1i ((x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi )) = det(\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi )), so \u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi ) is not\ninvertible in Mni (Li ), which implies that x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi cannot be invertible in R/Pi .\nSummarizing, C = \u222ai\u2208N C(i), which is countable.\nNotice: The argument that C is countable could also be used to show that B is\ncountable (but not vice versa). We separated to two sets B and C (according to\nthe two different options for a height 1 prime to have finite or infinite codimension,\nrespectively), for two reasons; First, it seems better to give an easier argument where\npossible. Second, in Theorem 2.7 it will be clear that the argument that the set C\nthere (which is defined a little differently from the set C here) is countable cannot\nnecessarily be used to show that B is countable.\nNext, define E := k \u2212 (A \u222a B \u222a C). E is uncountable. Take any nonzero \u03bb \u2208 E.\nx \u2212 \u03bb is not left invertible in R (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ A). Hence R(x \u2212 \u03bb) ( R, so there exists\na maximal left ideal L such that R(x \u2212 \u03bb) \u2286 L. annR (R/L) is a primitive ideal of R.\nThere are two options for annR (R/L):\n(I) annR (R/L) = 0. Then R is primitive.\n(II) annR (R/L) 6= 0. Hence annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 .\nWe shall now see that annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 is impossible:\n(1) annR (R/L) \u2208 T : So annR (R/L) = Qi for some i \u2208 M.\nQi = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We have an impossible situation: On\nthe one hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi is invertible in R/Qi (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ B). On the\nother hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi \u2208 L/Qi \u2286 R/Qi , where L/Qi is a maximal left\nideal of R/Qi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T cannot be true.\n(2) annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303 : So annR (R/L) = Q \u0303\u03c6 for some \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. There exists\ni \u2208 N such that Pi ( Q \u0303\u03c6 = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We have an\nimpossible situation: On the one hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Pi is invertible in R/Pi\n(since \u03bb \u2208\n/ C). On the other hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Pi \u2208 L/Pi \u2286 R/Pi , where\nL/Pi is a maximal left ideal of R/Pi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303 cannot be true.\nHence only (I) is possible, so R is primitive.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f23\n\n2.3. There exists a non-algebraic element with nilpotent images. One may\nwish to take in Theorem 2.6 an uncountable field which is not necessarily algebraically\nclosed. Going back to the proof of Theorem 2.6 shows that the assumptions that k is\nalgebraically closed and R has such a special non-algebraic element x, guarantees that\nfor every height 1 prime I, the characteristic polynomial of x + I \u2208 R/I \u0592\u2192 MnI (LI ),\ncI (t), is over k. (If GKdim(R/I) = 1, then cI (t) is apriori over LI ). This (and the fact\nthat the characteristic polynomial of x \u2212 \u03bc + I is over k, for any \u03bc \u2208 k) guarantees\nthat for every \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 DI , x \u2212 \u03bb + I is invertible in R/I (DI is the set of roots of\ncI (t)). Now, without assuming that k is algebraically closed, we also want to find for\nevery height 1 prime I, a finite (or countable) subset of k, call it EI , such that for\nevery \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EI , x \u2212 \u03bb + I is invertible in R/I.\n\u2022 For the height 1 primes with finite codimension, this is immediate; just choose\nany non-algebraic element x \u2208 R and take EI to be the roots of the characteristic polynomial of x + I \u2208 R/I \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/I) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/I) (k).\n\u2022 For the height 1 primes with infinite codimension (co-GK 1), it is not yet clear\nwhether algebraicity of an element x + I \u2208 R/I guarantees the existence of\na finite (or countable) EI \u2282 k, such that for every \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EI , x \u2212 \u03bb + I is\ninvertible in R/I.\nObserve that now (when k is not algebraically closed), even though the\ncharacteristic polynomial of x + I \u2208 R/I \u0592\u2192 MnI (LI ) may not be over k, such\na finite subset of k, EI , may exist, as the following example shows: Let k = R,\nR/I \u0592\u2192 M2 (C(X)) where X is an indeterminate (X commutes with C) and\nx+I = iI2 . x+I is algebraic over R since it satisfies t2 +1, but its characteristic\npolynomial is t2 \u2212 2it \u2212 1 \u2208\n/ R[t]. However, one can take EI = \u2205; Indeed, for\nevery \u03bb \u2208 R \u2212 EI = R, x \u2212 \u03bb + I = (x + I) \u2212 (\u03bb + I) = (iI2 ) \u2212 (\u03bbI2 ) = (i \u2212 \u03bb)I2 ,\nwhich is invertible in R/I, since its inverse is (1/(i \u2212 \u03bb))I2 = ((i + \u03bb)/ \u2212 (1 +\n\u03bb2 ))I2 = (i + / \u2212 (1 + \u03bb2 ))I2 + (\u03bb/ \u2212 (1 + \u03bb2 ))I2 \u2208 R/I.\nAgain, as was mentioned in the discussion preceeding Theorem 2.6, if R has only\nfinitely many prime ideals P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, then R is primitive without\nany further assumptions, as was proved in Theorem 2.4. So if that is the case, then\nwe are done.\nTherefore, the assumptions in the following Theorem 2.7 are crucial when there are\ncountably many (infinite) such primes.\nTheorem 2.7. Let k be an uncountable field and let R be an affine prime Goldie nonsimple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3. If R has a non-algebraic element\nx such that for every prime ideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1:\n(i) If P is completely prime, x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k\n(ii) If P is not completely prime, x + P \u2208 R/P is nilpotent,\nthen R is primitive.\nProof. If there are only finitely many primes with co-GK 1, then we are done.\nSo assume that there are infinitely many such primes (necessarily countably many).\nDenote them by {Pi }i\u2208N (third kind primes). Separate the third kind primes into\ntwo (disjoint) sets: {Pi }i\u2208N1 the completely primes (|N1 | \u2264 \u05d00 ), and {Pi }i\u2208N2 the\nones that are not completely primes (|N2 | \u2264 \u05d00 ).

Define four countable subsets of k.\nA := {\u03b1 \u2208 k| x \u2212 \u03b1 is left invertible in R}: Indeed, from Amitsur's trick A is\ncountable (By assumption, x is non-algebraic).\nB := {\u03b2 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 M such that x \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi \u2208 R/Qi\nis not invertible in R/Qi }: Indeed, \u2200i \u2208 M R/Qi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k).\nTherefore, there exists only finitely many \u03b2 \u2208 k (=the roots of the characteristic\npolynomial of x+Qi \u2208 R/Oi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k)) such that x\u2212\u03b2 +Qi =\n(x + Qi ) \u2212 (\u03b2 + Qi ) is not invertible in R/Qi , denote them B(i) = {\u03b2(i)1 , . . . , \u03b2(i)mi }.\nThen B = \u222ai\u2208M B(i), which is countable.\nC := {\u03b3 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 N1 such that x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi \u2208 R/Pi is not invertible in\nR/Pi }: Fix i \u2208 N1 . From (i), x + Pi \u2208 R/Pi is algebraic over k, hence for every \u03b3 \u2208 k,\n(x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b3 + Pi ) = x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi is algebraic over k. R/Pi is a domain, hence for every\n\u03b3 \u2208 k, except maybe one scalar \u03b3i \u2208 k, x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi is regular (If x + Pi is non-scalar,\nthen for every \u03b3 \u2208 k, x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi 6= 0\u0304, hence regular. If there exists \u03b3i \u2208 k such that\nx+ Pi = \u03b3i + Pi , then for every \u03b3 \u2208 k \u2212{\u03b3i }, x\u2212\u03b3 + Pi 6= 0\u0304, hence regular). Therefore,\nfor every \u03b3 \u2208 k, except maybe one scalar \u03b3i \u2208 k, x \u2212 \u03b3 + Pi is invertible in R/Pi\n(since an element which is algebraic and regular is invertible). For every i \u2208 N1 , let\nC(i) = {\u03b3i } if x + Pi = \u03b3i + Pi , otherwise C(i) = \u2205. It is clear that C = \u222ai\u2208N1 C(i),\nwhich is countable.\nD := {\u03b4 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 N2 such that x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi \u2208 R/Pi is not invertible in\nR/Pi }: Fix i \u2208 N2 . R/Pi is a prime PI algebra, hence can be embedded in a matrix\nring over a field extension of k: R/Pi \u0592\u2192 Mni (Li ), where Li is a field extension of k.\nFrom (ii), x + Pi \u2208 R/Pi is nilpotent, so let fi (t) = tli be such that (x + Pi )li =\nfi (x + Pi ) = 0 + Pi\n\u03c1i\nNow think of x + Pi \u2208 R/Pi \u0592\u2192 Mni (Li ) as a matrix over Li . Obviously, fi (\u03c1i (x +\nPi )) = \u03c1i ((fi (x + Pi )) = \u03c1i (0 + Pi ) = 0. Hence, the minimal polynomial of \u03c1i (x + Pi ),\n\u2032\ncall it mi (t) \u2208 Li [t], divides fi (t). But fi (t) = tli , so obviously mi (t) = tli with\nli\u2032 \u2264 li . Then the characteristic polynomial of \u03c1i (x + Pi ), call it ci (t) \u2208 Li [t] must\nbe ci (t) = tni . Take any nonzero \u03b4 \u2208 k. We claim that x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi is invertible in\nR/Pi ; Indeed, let ci,\u03b4 (t) \u2208 Li [t] be the characteristic polynomial of \u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi ).\nci,\u03b4 (t) = det(\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi ) \u2212 tI) = det(\u03c1i ((x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b4 + Pi )) \u2212 tI) = det(\u03c1i (x +\nPi ) \u2212 \u03c1i (\u03b4 + Pi ) \u2212 tI) = det(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 \u03b4I \u2212 tI) = det(\u03c1i (x + Pi ) \u2212 (\u03b4 + t)I) =\nci (\u03b4 + t) = (\u03b4 + t)ni \u2208 k[t]. So, ci,\u03b4 (t) = (\u03b4 + t)ni = tni + bni \u22121 tni \u22121 + . . . + b1 t + b0 with\nbni \u22121 , . . . , b1 , b0 \u2208 k (actually bj = C(ni \u2212j, ni )\u03b4 ni \u2212j . From Cayley-Hamilton theorem,\nci,\u03b4 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi )) = 0. Then, it is clear that \u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi ) \u2208 Mni (Li ) is invertible\nwith inverse ((\u2212b0 )\u22121 )((\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi ))ni \u22121 + bni \u22121 (\u03c1i (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi ))ni \u22122 + . . . + b1 I).\nFrom this we can conclude that in R/Pi , x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi is invertible with inverse\n((\u2212b0 )\u22121 )((x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi )ni \u22121 + bni \u22121 (x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi )ni \u22122 + . . . + b1 1) \u2208 R/Pi (we use the fact\nthat \u03c1i is injective).\nDefine D(i) = {0} \u2282 k. Of course, for \u03b4 \u2208 D(i): x \u2212 \u03b4 + Pi = x + Pi is our nilpotent\nelement, which is not invertible. It is clear that D = \u222ai\u2208N2 D(i) = {0}, which is\ncountable.\nNext, define E := k \u2212 (A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D). E is uncountable. Take any \u03bb \u2208 E. x \u2212 \u03bb is\nnot left invertible in R (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ A). Hence R(x \u2212 \u03bb) ( R, so there exists a maximal\n\n\f25\n\nleft ideal L such that R(x \u2212 \u03bb) \u2286 L. annR (R/L) is a primitive ideal of R. There are\ntwo options for annR (R/L):\n(I) annR (R/L) = 0. Then R is primitive.\n(II) annR (R/L) 6= 0. Hence annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 .\nWe shall now see that annR (R/L) \u2208 T \u222a T\u0303 is impossible:\n(1) annR (R/L) \u2208 T : So annR (R/L) = Qi for some i \u2208 M.\nQi = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We have an impossible situation: On\nthe one hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi is invertible in R/Qi (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ B). On the\nother hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi \u2208 L/Qi \u2286 R/Qi , where L/Qi is a maximal left\nideal of R/Qi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T cannot be true.\n(2) annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303 : So annR (R/L) = Q \u0303\u03c6 for some \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. There exists\ni \u2208 N = N1 \u222a N2 such that Pi ( Q \u0303\u03c6 = annR (R/L) = core(L) \u2286 L. We\nhave an impossible situation: On the one hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Pi is invertible in\nR/Pi (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ (C \u222a D)). On the other hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Pi \u2208 L/Pi \u2286 R/Pi ,\nwhere L/Pi is a maximal left ideal of R/Pi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T\u0303 cannot\nbe true.\nHence only (I) is possible, so R is primitive.\n\u0003\n2.4. Another partial answer to Small's question. When k is not algebraically\nclosed, we have seen in Theorem 2.7 that the existence of a non-algebraic element\nx \u2208 R with algebraic images in completely primes with co-GK 1, and nilpotent images\nin the other primes with co-GK 1, guarantees that R is primitive. If one prefers the\nweaker assumption, that of Theorem 2.6 when k was algebraically closed, (namely,\nthe existence of a non-algebraic element x \u2208 R with algebraic images in primes with\nco-GK 1), then one may add an additional condition in order to guarantee that R is\nprimitive. The following definition will be used in the additional condition.\nDefinition 2.8. Let C be a commutative k-algebra (k is any field). For the polynomial\nring C[t], the property (*), is as follows: If f (t) \u2208 C[t] and g(t) \u2208 C[t] have f (t)g(t) \u2208\nk[t], then necessarily f (t) \u2208 k[t] and g(t) \u2208 k[t].\nFor example: C = k[X] has the property (*), since it is clear that if a product\nof two polynomials over k[X] is a polynomial over k, then each of these polynomials\nmust be over k. A non-example is C = k(X), since 1 = X * (1/X).\nTheorem 2.9. Let k be an uncountable field and let R be an affine prime Goldie nonsimple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3. If R has a non-algebraic element\nx \u2208 R, such that x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k, for every prime ideal P with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1, and also for every such prime P , the polynomial ring Z(R/P )[t]\nhas the property (*), then R is primitive.\nProof. The discussion in the beginning of the previous subsection shows that if the\nfollowing condition is satisfied, then R is primitive: For every prime ideal P with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1, there exists a finite (or countable) subset of k, call it EP , such\nthat for every \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EP , x \u2212 \u03bb + P is invertible in R/P . Therefore, we only need\nto show that, in our R, for every prime ideal P with GKdim(R/P ) = 1, there exists\nsuch a finite set.\nLet P be a prime ideal with co-GK 1. R/P is a finite module over its center; this\ncan be seen by either one of the following two arguments:\n\n\f26\n\n\u2022 Small and Warfield have shown in [26] that an affine prime k-algebra with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1 is a finite module over its center.\n\u2022 Farina and Pendergrass-Rice have shown in [7, Corollary 2] that a PI just\ninfinite algebra is a finite module over its center (observe that R/P is indeed\na PI just infinite algebra).\nLet R/P \u223c\n= \u03a3ni=1 Z(R/P )r \u0304i , where r \u0304i \u2208 R/P . Hence, each element of R/P can be\nthought of as a matrix over Z(R/P ). Reason: each \u0233 \u2208 R/P can be thought of as\nan Z(R/P )-endomorphism of R/P , namely the left multiplication by \u0233. The matrix\nwhich represents this left multiplication is, of course, (aij ), where for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\n\u0233 r \u0304i = \u03a3nj=1 aji r \u0304j . Indeed, (aij )[r \u0304i ] = [\u0233 r \u0304i ]).\n(A remark: Although there may exist more then one way to think of an element\nof R/P as a matrix over Z(R/P ) (since the r \u0304i 's are probably \"dependent\"), it seems\nthat for what we would like to prove, this will not be a problem).\nNow, in particular, x\u0304 = x + P \u2208 R/P \u223c\n= \u03a3ni=1 Z(R/P )r \u0304i can be thought of as a\nmatrix over Z(R/P ). Z(R/P ) is a commutative domain, so it has a field of fractions,\nF (Z(R/P )). x\u0304 is algebraic over k, so let f (t) \u2208 k[t] be such that f (x\u0304) = 0\u0304. Let\n{Aj }j\u2208J \u2286 Mn (Z(R/P )) \u2282 Mn (F (Z(R/P ))) be all the possible options to view x\u0304 as\nan element of Mn (Z(R/P )) (we don't have any information about |J|, but we shall\nimmediately see that this is not a problem).\nObviously, for each Aj : f (Aj ) = 0\u0304 (since f (x\u0304) = 0\u0304 and if a matrix B represents\nx\u0304, then for any polynomial h(t) \u2208 Z(R/P )[t], h(B) represents h(x\u0304)), so each Aj is\nalgebraic over k. Denote by cj (t) \u2208 F (Z(R/P ))[t] the characteristic polynomial of\nAj \u2208 Mn (Z(R/P )) \u2282 Mn (F (Z(R/P ))), and denote by mj (t) \u2208 F (Z(R/P ))[t] the\nminimal polynomial of Aj .\nWe claim that, for each j \u2208 J, cj (t) \u2208 k[t]; Fix j \u2208 J. In F (Z(R/P ))[t] we\nhave: f (t) = q(t)mj (t) with q(t) \u2208 F (Z(R/P ))[t], mj (t) \u2208 F (Z(R/P ))[t]. From\nGauss's lemma, q(t) \u2208 Z(R/P )[t], mj (t) \u2208 Z(R/P )[t]. So, we have f (t) = q(t)mj (t)\nwith f (t) \u2208 k[t] and q(t), mj (t) \u2208 Z(R/P )[t]. But we have assumed that Z(R/P )[t]\nhas the property (*), therefore, q(t), mj (t) \u2208 k[t]. Now, write mj (t) as a product of irreducible polynomials in F (Z(R/P )): mj (t) = irr1,j (t) * * * irruj ,j (t), where\nirr1,j (t), . . . , irruj ,j \u2208 F (Z(R/P ))[t]. Use Gauss's lemma again to conclude that\nirr1,j (t), . . . , irruj ,j \u2208 Z(R/P )[t]. So, we have mj (t) = irr1,j (t) * * * irruj ,j (t) with\nmj (t) \u2208 k[t] and irr1,j (t), . . . , irruj ,j \u2208 Z(R/P )[t]. But we have assumed that\nZ(R/P )[t] has the property (*), therefore, irr1,j (t), . . . , irruj ,j \u2208 k[t]. Finally, since\neach irreducible factor of cj (t) is an irreducible of mj (t), we have cj (t) \u2208 k[t], as\nclaimed.\nLet K be the algebraic closure of k, so f (t) = (t \u2212 \u03b11 ) * * * (t \u2212 \u03b1d ), where d = deg(f )\nand \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1d \u2208 K (it may happen that \u03b1i = \u03b1j for i 6= j). Define E \u0303P =: {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1d }\n(E \u0303P \u2282 K).\nFix j \u2208 J. Hence, mj (t) = (t\u2212\u03b1l1 ) * * * (t\u2212\u03b1lsj ), where {l1 , . . . , lsj } \u2286 {1, . . . , d} and\nsj \u2264 d. So, \u03b1l1 , . . . , \u03b1lsj \u2286 E \u0303P are the only roots of mj (t). Therefore, \u03b1l1 , . . . , \u03b1lsj \u2286\nE \u0303P are also the only roots of cj (t). This shows that the only possible options for the\nroots of any cj (t), j \u2208 J, are among the elements of E \u0303P .\nDefine EP := E \u0303P \u2229 k. For any \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EP : Fix j \u2208 J. cj (\u03bb) = det(\u03bbI \u2212 Aj ) \u2208 k \u2212 0\n(\u2208 k since cj (t) \u2208 k[t], and 6= 0 since \u03bb is not a root of cj (t)). Now, x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u2208 R/P is\n\n\f27\n\nof course algebraic over k (since x\u0304 \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k), so let g(x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1) = 0,\nwith g(t) \u2208 k[t]. Let {Bl }l\u2208L \u2286 Mn ((Z(R/P )) \u2282 Mn (F (Z(R/P ))) be all the possible\noptions to view x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1 as an element of Mn (Z(R/P )). For each Bl , g(Bl ) = 0, so\nBl is algebraic over k, hence (from arguments just seen for Aj ), the characteristic\npolynomial of Bl , c\u2032l (t), is over k (c\u2032l (t) \u2208 k[t]).\nNotice that for any Aj , Aj \u2212 \u03bbI is a possible option for x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1 as an element of\nMn (Z(R/P )), so {Aj \u2212 \u03bbI}j\u2208J \u2286 {Bl }l\u2208L . Actually, one can see that {Aj \u2212 \u03bbI}j\u2208J =\n{Bl }l\u2208L .\nChoose any j \u2208 J, then for Aj \u2212 \u03bbI: Aj \u2212 \u03bbI = Bl for some l \u2208 L. Denote\n\u2032\ncl (t) = (\u22121)n tn + bn\u22121 tn\u22121 + . . . + b1 t + b0 with bi \u2208 k. Of course b0 = det(Bl ).\nSo, we have b0 = det(Bl ) = det(Aj \u2212 \u03bbI) = cj (\u03bb) \u2208 k \u2212 0. From Cayley-Hamilton\nTheorem, 0 = c\u2032l (Bl ) = (\u22121)n Bln + bn\u22121 Bln\u22121 + . . . + b1 Bl + b0 , hence (\u22121)n Bln +\nbn\u22121 Bln\u22121 + . . . + b1 Bl = \u2212b0 , implying ((\u22121)n Bln\u22121 + bn\u22121 Bln\u22122 + . . . + b1 I)Bl = \u2212b0 ,\nso (\u2212b0 )\u22121 ((\u22121)n Bln\u22121 + bn\u22121 Bln\u22122 + . . . + b1 I)Bl = I,\nso (\u2212b0 )\u22121 ((\u22121)n (Aj \u2212 \u03bbI)n\u22121 + bn\u22121 (Aj \u2212 \u03bbI)n\u22122 + . . . + b1 I)(Aj \u2212 \u03bbI) = I,\nThis shows that, in R/P , (\u2212b0 )\u22121 ((\u22121)n (x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1)n\u22121 + bn\u22121 (x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1)n\u22122 + . . . +\nb1 1)(x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1) = 1.\nTherefore, in R/P , x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1 is invertible (since we have found an element in R/P ,\n(\u2212b0 )\u22121 ((\u22121)n (x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1)n\u22121 + bn\u22121 (x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1)n\u22122 + . . . + b1 1) which is a left and a right\ninverse of x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1).\nWe have shown that, for any \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EP , x\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb1 = x \u2212 \u03bb + P is invertible in R/P\n(we have already seen that EP \u2282 k, |EP | \u2264 d).\n\u0003\nNotice that in the above proof of Theorem 2.9, we viewed x + P \u2208 R/P as a matrix\nover Z(R/P ), although an embedding R/P \u0592\u2192 Mn (Z(R/P )) does not necessarily\nexists. In the next theorem we impose a similar condition to that of Theorem 2.9,\nand this time R/P will be embedded in a matrix ring.\nBut first observe that for an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field, the following is true:\nTake a prime ideal P of R with GKdim(R/P ) = 1. Since R/P is a prime\nGoldie ring (R/P is Goldie since it is prime PI), it has a classical (Goldie) ring\nof quotients, Q(R/P ), which is isomorphic to Mn (D), where D is a division kalgebra (see [10, Theorem 1.35]). Actually, since R/P is prime PI, Posner's theorem ([10, Theorem 3.2]) says that Q(R/P ) is also PI, so by Kaplansky's theorem\nQ(R/P ) is finite dimensional over its center, Z(Q(R/P )) \u223c\n= Z(Mn (D)) \u223c\n= Z(D). So,\ndimZ(D) (Mn (D)) < \u221e, hence dimZ(D) (D) < \u221e. Denote dimZ(D) (D) = m, then\ndimZ(D) (Mn (D)) = mn2 and we have Mn (D) \u0592\u2192 EndZ(D) (Mn (D)) \u223c\n= Mmn2 (Z(D)).\n\u223c\nTherefore, R/P \u0592\u2192 Q(R/P ) = Mn (D) \u0592\u2192 Mmn2 (Z(D)).\nZ(D) is, of course, a field extension of k. We will add a condition on Z(D), which,\ntogether with the existence of a special non-algebraic element, will guarantee the\nprimitivity of R. (Notice that Bell has mentioned in [6, Remark 2.5] that Z(D) is a\nfinitely generated field extension of k of transcendence degree 1. Hence, the condition\nwe will add seems not too restrictive. Remember that when k is algebraically closed,\nTheorem 2.6 already tells us that R is primitive).\nTheorem 2.10. Let k be an uncountable field and let R be an affine prime Goldie\nnon-simple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3. If R has a non-algebraic\nelement x \u2208 R, such that x + P \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k, for every prime ideal P\n\n\f28\n\nwith GKdim(R/P ) = 1, and also for every such prime P , the center of the classical\n(Goldie) ring of quotients of R/P , Z(Q(R/P )), is isomorphic to k(X), then R is\nprimitive.\nProof. As was mentioned in the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2.9, it is enough\nto show that the following condition is satisfied: For every prime ideal P with\nGKdim(R/P ) = 1, there exists a finite (or countable) subset of k, call it EP , such\nthat for every \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EP , x \u2212 \u03bb + P is invertible in R/P .\nLet P be a prime ideal with co-GK 1. x\u0304 \u2208 R/P is algebraic over k; let f (t) \u2208\nk[t] be such that f (x\u0304) = 0\u0304. x\u0304 \u2208 R/P \u0592\u2192 Q(R/P ) \u223c\n= Mn (D) \u0592\u2192 Mmn2 (Z(D)),\nthus viewing x\u0304 as an element of Mmn2 (Z(D)), it has a characteristic polynomial\nc(t) \u2208 Z(D)[t] and a minimal polynomial m(t) \u2208 Z(D)[t]. Of course, in Z(D)[t]:\nm(t)|f (t), so f (t) = q(t)m(t) with q(t) \u2208 Z(D)[t]. But we have assumed that Z(D) \u223c\n=\nk(X), so f (t) = q(t)m(t) with q(t), m(t) \u2208 k(X)[t]. From Gauss's lemma, it follows\nthat q(t), m(t) \u2208 k[X][t]. But then, obviously, q(t), m(t) \u2208 k[t]. Now, in k(X)[t],\nwrite m(t) as a product of irreducible polynomials, each, apriori is over k(X). Then\nGauss's lemma shows that each irreducible factor of m(t) is over k[X]. But then each\nirreducible factor of m(t) is over k. Therefore, c(t) is also over k. Finally, take EP to\nbe the set of roots of c(t). It is clear that for every \u03bb \u2208 k \u2212 EP , x \u2212 \u03bb + P is invertible\nin R/P .\n\u0003\n2.5. The extended center. Smoktunowicz in her paper [27] proves the following:\n\"Let k be a field, and let R be an affine k-algebra, which is a domain with quadratic\ngrowth. Then either the center of R is an affine k-algebra or R satisfies a polynomial\nidentity (is PI) or else R is algebraic over k\".\nWe (almost) generalize Smoktunowicz's theorem in case the base field k is uncountable.\nTheorem 2.11. Let R be an affine prime Goldie non-simple k-algebra with GK\ndimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. Then R is PI or the center of\nR is a finite dimensional field extension of k.\nObserve that this is indeed a generalisation in case k is uncountable: a domain\nwith quadratic growth is (prime) Goldie and quadratic growth implies GK dimension\n2. Also, in Theorem 2.11 (as well as in Smoktunowicz's theorem), non-simplicity of\nR implies that R is not algebraic over k. This is because an algebraic prime Goldie\nalgebra is simple.\nProof. Assume that R is non-PI. Hence R is an almost PI algebra. Use Proposition\n1.50 to conclude that Z(R) is a finite dimensional field extension of k.\n\u0003\nWe can consider the extended center of such algebras.\nTheorem 2.12. Let R be an affine (non-simple) prime Goldie k-algebra with GK\ndimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. Then R is PI or the extended center\nof R is algebraic over k.\nProof. Assume that R is non-PI. Hence R is an almost PI algebra. Use Proposition\n1.44 or Proposition 1.45 to conclude that C(R) is algebraic over k.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.12 is a special case of a result of Bell and Smoktunowicz brought in [5]:\n\"Let k be a field and let A be a finitely generated prime k-algebra. We generalize a\n\n\f29\n\nresult of Smith and Zhang, showing that if A is not PI and does not have a locally\nnilpotent ideal, then the extended centre of A has transcendence degree at most\nGKdim(A) \u2212 2 over k\". Indeed, our algebra R is prime Goldie, hence R does not\nhave a locally nilpotent ideal. Therefore, their theorem says that the extended centre\nof R has transcendence degree at most GKdim(R) \u2212 2 < 3 \u2212 2 = 1 over k, hence\nthe extended centre of R is algebraic over k. Their theorem is more general because\nthere R is not necessarily Goldie, GKdim(R) can be \u2265 3, and k is not necessarily\nuncountable.\nIn the special case when k is also algebraically closed, we get the following.\nCorollary 2.13. Let R be an affine prime Goldie (non-simple) non PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable algebraically closed field. Then R is\nstably almost PI.\nProof. Just use Corollary 1.46 to conclude that R is stably almost PI.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Just infinite algebras\n3.1. Some remarks about Farkas and Small's theorem. Remember Farkas and\nSmall's theorem which says that an affine semiprimitive just infinite algebra over an\nuncountable field is PI or primitive.\nFirst notice that if one insists not to assume semiprimitivity, then one gets the\nfollowing trichotomy (which is consistent with the Golod-Shafarevich example, which\nis algebraic).\nTheorem 3.1 (Farkas and Small). Let R be an affine just infinite algebra over an\nuncountable field k. Then R is algebraic over k or PI or primitive.\nProof. Assume that R in non-algebraic and non-PI. Take any non-algebraic element\nx \u2208 R. Denote all the nonzero prime ideals of R by {Qi }i\u2208M . Of course each nonzero\nprime ideal is maximal (since a prime finite dimensional algebra is simple). So each\nnonzero prime ideal is of height 1 (remember that a just infinite algebra is prime,\nsee [7]). R is an almost PI algebra (since we assume that R is non-PI), hence from\nProposition 1.26, |M| \u2264 \u05d00 .\nDefine two countable subsets of k: A := {\u03b1 \u2208 k| x \u2212 \u03b1 is left invertible in R}:\nIndeed, from Amitsur's trick A is countable (x is non-algebraic).\nB := {\u03b2 \u2208 k| there exists i \u2208 M such that x \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi \u2208 R/Qi\nis not invertible in R/Qi }: Indeed, \u2200i \u2208 M R/Qi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k).\nTherefore, there exists only finitely many \u03b2 \u2208 k (=the roots of the characteristic\npolynomial of x+Qi \u2208 R/Qi \u0592\u2192 Endk (R/Qi ) \u223c\n= Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k)) such that x\u2212\u03b2 +Qi =\n(x + Qi ) \u2212 (\u03b2 + Qi ) is not invertible in R/Qi , denote them B(i) = {\u03b2(i)1 , . . . , \u03b2(i)mi }\n(obviously, for \u03b2 \u2208 k \u2212 B(i), x \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi is invertible in R/Qi , since its inverse, as an\nelement of Mdimk (R/Qi ) (k), is a k-linear combination of powers of x \u2212 \u03b2 + Qi , which is\nin R/Qi ). Then B = \u222ai\u2208M B(i), which is countable.\nNext, define E := k \u2212 (A \u222a B). E is uncountable.\nTake any \u03bb \u2208 E.\nx \u2212 \u03bb is not left invertible in R (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ A). Hence R(x \u2212 \u03bb) ( R, so there exists\na maximal left ideal L such that R(x \u2212 \u03bb) \u2286 L. annR (R/L) is a primitive ideal of R.\nThere are two options for annR (R/L):\n(I) annR (R/L) = 0. Then R is primitive.\n\n\f30\n\n(II) annR (R/L) 6= 0. Hence annR (R/L) = Qi for some i \u2208 M. Qi = annR (R/L) =\ncore(L) \u2286 L. We have an impossible situation: On the one hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi\nis invertible in R/Qi (since \u03bb \u2208\n/ B). On the other hand, x \u2212 \u03bb + Qi \u2208 L/Qi \u2286\nR/Qi , where L/Qi is a maximal left ideal of R/Qi . So annR (R/L) \u2208 T cannot\nbe true.\nHence only (I) is possible, so R is primitive.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe show that instead of R affine over an uncountable field k, one can assume \"the\nusual dimension-cardinality hypothesis\", namely dimk (R) < |k|.\nTheorem 3.2 (Farkas and Small). Let R be a just infinite algebra over a field k, with\ndimk (R) < |k|. Then R is algebraic over k or PI or primitive.\nProof. Notice that in the above proof of Theorem 3.1, we have used affinity twice\n(and uncountability of k once):\n\u2022 When using Proposition 1.26, to conclude that R, as an affine almost PI\nalgebra (since we assume that R is non-PI) has only countably many height\n1 primes.\n\u2022 When using Amitsur's trick, to conclude that the set A is countable. Not only\naffinity was used, but also uncountability of k.\nHowever, under the weaker assumption that dimk (R) < |k|, we can still have the\nsame conclusions:\n\u2022 Instead of Proposition 1.26 we can use Proposition 1.22. Indeed, R is an\nalmost PI algebra (again we assume that it is non-PI), and as a just infinite\nalgebra it satisfies ACC(ideals), so in particular, ACC(semiprimes).\n\u2022 Of course, in order to use Amitsur's trick, it is enough to have dimk (R) < |k|.\nTherefore, the proof of Theorem 3.1 is applicable here also, with the two new arguments just mentioned used, instead of the old ones.\n\u0003\nNotice that in Theorem 3.1 as well as in Theorem 3.2, semiprimitivity was not\nassumed, since we wanted to have a trichotomy. However, if one wishes to have\na dichotomy (namely, PI or primitive), then also \"the usual dimension-cardinality\nhypothesis\" can replace \"affine over an uncountable field\". This answers what Farina\nand Pendergrass-Rice have written in [7, section 3], that it is unknown whether,\nexcept semiprimitivity, the other hypotheses can be relaxed. But maybe they have\nmeant that it is unknown what happens over finite or countable fields; in that case\nthe next theorem does not give an answer.\nTheorem 3.3. Let R be a semiprimitive just infinite algebra over a field k, with\ndimk (R) < |k|. Then R is PI or primitive.\nProof. Exactly the same proof as the original proof of Farkas and Small will work\nhere. Just pay attention to the following:\n\u2022 As a non-PI just infinite algebra, R has only countably many nonzero primitive\nideals, as was explained there. Affinity is not needed.\n\u2022 Since dimk (R) < |k|, Amitsur's linear independence trick can be used to show\nthat R is an algebraic algebra over k.\n\n\f31\n\n\u2022 Fisher and Snider's theorem can still be applied; Since R is a non-PI just\ninfinite algebra, it is an almost PI algebra. Hence Proposition 1.20 can be\nused (indeed, in Proposition 1.20, affinity is not needed). The difference is\nthat instead of taking as a countable cofinal subset the set {Tn (R)}, we take\nthe set {Sn,d }.\n\u0003\n3.2. When an affine prime Goldie algebra with GK dimension less then\n3 over an uncountable field is just infinite. Let R be an affine prime Goldie\nnon-simple non-PI k-algebra with GK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field.\nIt may happen that R is a (non-PI) just infinite algebra. In that case, R must be\nprimitive: Indeed, from Lemma 2.1 R is semiprimitive, so Farkas and Small's theorem\nimplies that R is primitive.\nIf R is bounded (for definition, see 1.32), then R is a (non-PI) just infinite algebra.\nIndeed, we have seen in Theorem 1.33 that a bounded affine almost PI algebra is\n(non-PI) just infinite. However, boundedness is a very restrictive condition, so we\nlook for a weaker condition that will guarantee that R is just infinite.\nProposition 3.4. Let R be an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. If there are only countably many\nprimitive ideals in R, then R is a non-PI just infinite algebra. In that case, R is\nprimitive.\nNotice that for the above R, the converse is also true, namely: If R is a non-PI just\ninfinite algebra, then there are only countably many primitive ideals in R. This was\nexplained in the beginning of the proof of Farkas and Small's theorem.\nProof. In view of [7, Corollary 1], it is enough to show that every nonzero prime ideal\nhas finite codimension. From Lemma 2.2, R can have three kinds of nonzero prime\nideals. If R has a third kind prime, then Corollary 2.3 would imply that there are\nuncountably many first kind primes. But each first kind prime is primitive, and we\nhave assumed that R has only countably many primitive ideals. Therefore, R has no\nthird kind primes. Hence R has no first kind primes (since a first kind prime must\ncontain a third kind prime). So, Spec(R) = {0, second kind primes}, and since each\nsecond kind prime has finite codimension, we are done.\n\u0003\nSmoktunowicz has written in [28, page 266]:\"...another question of Small: if R is\na Noetherian affine algebra with quadratic growth, does it follow that R is either\nprimitive or PI? This is true in the graded case, as was shown by Artin and Stafford\nin 2000. According to Small, it is also true if every nonzero prime ideal in R is\nmaximal.\"\nA remark about \"According to Small, it is also true if every nonzero prime ideal in\nR is maximal\":\n\u2022 If k is uncountable: We shall see a proof of this in the following Proposition\n3.5.\n\u2022 If |k| \u2264 \u05d00 : It is interesting to see Small's proof. Apriori, it seems that\nsuch an algebra can even have a nonzero Jacobson radical, in contrast to the\nuncountable case where semiprimitivity is guaranteed (Lemma 2.1).\n\n\f32\n\nIn the same spirit, we bring the following Proposition 3.5. On the one hand, here\nwe demand less: our algebra is Goldie with GK dimension < 3, instead of Noetherian\nwith quadratic growth and every nonzero prime ideal is primitive instead of maximal.\nOn the other hand, here we demand more: k is uncountable, instead of any field and\nR is prime.\nProposition 3.5. Let R be an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra with\nGK dimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field. If every nonzero prime ideal in\nR is primitive, then R is a non-PI just infinite algebra. In that case, R is primitive.\nProof. First proof: R is an affine almost PI algebra in which every nonzero prime\nideal is primitive, hence Corollary 1.10 says that R is a non-PI just infinite algebra.\nSecond, more concrete, proof: From Lemma 2.2, R can have three kinds of nonzero\nprime ideals. We have assumed that every nonzero prime ideal in R is primitive,\nso R has no third kind primes. Hence R has no first kind primes. So, Spec(R) =\n{0, second kind primes}. We are done either by [7, Corollary 1], or by the following\nargument: there are only countably many second kind primes (remember that an\naffine almost PI algebra has only countably many height 1 primes, see Proposition\n1.26). Each second kind prime is primitive, so R has only countably many primitive\nideals. Now use Proposition 3.4.\n\u0003\nNotice that for the above R, the converse is also true, namely: If R is a non-PI just\ninfinite algebra, then every nonzero prime ideal in R is primitive (actually, maximal,\nby [20, Corollary 1.6.30]).\nTherefore, for an affine prime Goldie non-simple non-PI k-algebra R with GK\ndimension < 3, where k is an uncountable field: there are only countably many\nprimitive ideals in R \u21d0\u21d2 R is non-PI just infinite \u21d0\u21d2 every nonzero prime ideal\nin R is primitive.\n4.
