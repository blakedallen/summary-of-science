The Unified theory (UT) represents\nefforts of this author to create the Hierarchical picture of the World, starting from specific\nBivacuum superfluid matrix, providing the elementary particles origination and fields,\nexcited by particles Corpuscle \uf0f0 Wave pulsation.\nBivacuum is introduced, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe, composed from non mixing\nsubquantum particles and antiparticles. The subquantum particles and antiparticles are\nconsidered, as the minimum stable vortical structures of Bivacuum with dimensions about or\nless than 10 \uf03f19 m of opposite direction of rotation (clockwise and anticlockwise) of zero\nmass and charge. Their spontaneous collective paired vortical excitations represent\nBivacuum dipoles in form of strongly correlated pairs: torus(V \uf02b \uf0de \uf02b antitorus(V \uf03f \uf0de, separated\nby energetic gap. Three kinds of Bivacuum dipoles are named Bivacuum fermions,\nantifermions and Bivacuum bosons. Their torus and antitorus in primordial Bivacuum are\ncharacterized by the opposite mass and charge, compensating each other and making\nBivacuum neutral with zero energy density. The radiuses of torus and antitorus of dipoles in\nsymmetric primordial Bivacuum are equal to each other and determined by Compton\nradiuses of three generation of e, mu, tau electrons. The infinitive number of Bivacuum\nfermions and antifermions: BVF \uf0b7 \uf0af \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0ec V \uf03f \uf0e0 i and BVF \uf0b9 \uf0af \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0ee V \uf03f \uf0e0 i and Bivacuum\nbosons: BVB \uf0b1 \uf0af \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0b7\uf0b9 V \uf03f \uf0e0 i , as intermediate state between BVF \uf0b7 and BVF \uf0b9 form\nsuperfluid matrix of Bivacuum (i \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de. The correlated torus V \uf02b and antitorus V \uf03f of\nthese triple dipoles has the opposite energy, mass, charge and magnetic moments.\nThe symmetric primordial Bivacuum can be considered as the Universal Reference Frame\n(URF), i.e. Ether, in contrast to Relative Reference Frame (RRF), used in special relativity\n(SR) theory. The elements of Ether - correspond to our Bivacuum dipoles. It will be shown\nin our work, that the result of Michelson - Morley experiment is a consequence of ether\ndrug by the Earth or Virtual Replica of the Earth in terms of our theory.\nThe 1st stage of elementary particles origination is a formation of sub-elementary fermions\nor antifermions. This is a result of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions (BVF \uf0bb \uf0de symmetry\nshift towards the positive or negative energy, correspondingly, as a result their pairs rotation\naround common axis. Due to relativistic dependence of Bivacuum dipoles on tangential\nvelocity of such rotation (v), their symmetry shift is accompanied by uncompensated mass\nand charge origination.\nThe 2nd stage of elementary particles formation is a fusion of triplets\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i from sub-elementary fermions and antifermions of corresponding\nlepton generation (i \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de, representing the electrons, muons and protons/neutrons. The\ntriplets are stabilized by three factors: a) the resonance exchange interaction of Bivacuum\nvirtual pressure waves (VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de i with pulsing sub-elementary fermions of Compton\nangular frequency: \uf067 iq\uf03d1 \uf03d m iq\uf03d1 c 2 /\uf0a4; b) the Coulomb attraction between sub-elementary\nfermions of the opposite charges; c) the gluons (pairs of cumulative virtual clouds in terms\nof our theory) exchange between sub-elementary fermions (quarks in the case of protons and\nneutrons).\nBoth of stages of triplets formation - symmetry shift and fusion occur at Golden mean (GM)\nconditions: (v/c) 2 \uf03d 0. 618.\nThe fusion of elementary fermions from sub-elementary ones can be accompanied by energy\nrelease, determined by the value of mass defect. A stable triplets of sub-elementary fermions\nhave some similarity with three Borromean rings, interlocing with each other - a symbol,\npopular in Medieval Italy.\nThe boson like photon in out theory \uf0d62\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0bb \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0bb S\uf03d\uf0b11 \uf0d7 is a result of\nfusion/annihilation of two triplets: \uf0dfelectron \uf02b positron\uf0e0, turning two asymmetric fermions\nto quasi-symmetric boson. More common way of photons origination is due to acceleration\nof elementary charges - triplets, following by sufficient symmetry shift in Cooper pairs:\n3[BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0, representing secondary anchor sites for [W] phase of these triplets. The\nlatter mechanism works, for example, in the process of atoms and molecules transitions from\ntheir excited to the ground state. The electromagnetic field, is a result of Corpuscle - Wave\npulsation of photons and their fast rotation with angular frequency (\uf067 rot ) in [C] phase, equal\n\n\f4\nin symmetric Bivacuum to photons \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation frequency. The pair of\nsub-elementary fermions of photon with similar spins F \uf02b\uf0bb \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0bb S\uf03d\uf0b11 determines its integer\nvalue of spin. The clockwise or anticlockwise direction of photon rotation, as respect to\ndirection of its propagation, corresponds to spin sign: S \uf03d \uf0b1\uf0a4.\nIt is shown, that the [corpuscle (C) \uf0f0 wave (W)] duality of fermions is a result of\nmodulation of quantum beats between the asymmetric 'actual' (torus) and 'complementary'\n(antitorus) states of sub-elementary fermions and antifermions by de Broglie wave (wave B)\nfrequency of these particles. The frequency of wave B is equal to frequency of [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0\n\uf0bb\npulsations of the primary 'anchor' Bivacuum fermion \uf0ddBVF anc \uf0de i of unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i directly\nrelated to translational kinetic energy and momentum of triplets. The [C] phase of each\nsub-elementary fermions of triplets \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i exists as a mass, electric and\nmagnetic asymmetric dipoles. The total energy, charge and spin of particle, moving in space\nwith velocity (v) is determined by the unpaired sub-elementary fermion F \uf0b1\uf0bb z , as far the\npaired ones in \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 x,y of triplets compensate each other. In the case of bosons, like\nphotons, propagating in space with light velocity, the contribution of the rest mass is zero or\nvery close to zero.\nThe [C \uf0b8 W] transition of fermions is a result of two stages superposition. The 1st stage is\na reversible dissociation of [C] phase to Cumulative virtual cloud \uf0ddCVC \uf0b1 \uf0de F \uf0b1\uf0bb of subquantum\n\uf0bb\n\nparticles and the 'anchor' Bivacuum fermion \uf0ddBVF anc \uf0de:\n\uf0ddI\uf0de:\n\nRecoil/Antirecoil\n\nF \uf0b1\uf0bb\n\nC\n\ni\n\n\uf0bb\n\n\uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e BVF anc \uf02b \uf0ddCVC \uf0b1 \uf0de F \uf0b1\uf0bb\nE,H,G \uf03f fields\n\nW\n\nThe 2nd stage of [C\uf0b8 W\uf0e0 transition is a reversible dissociation of the anchor Bivacuum\n\uf0bb\nfermion \uf0ddBVF anc \uf0de i \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0 ianc to symmetric \uf0ddBVF \uf0bb \uf0de i and the anchor cumulative\nvirtual cloud (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de BVF \uf0bbanc , with linear dimension and frequency, equal to of de Broglie\nwave length and frequency of particle, correspondingly:\n\uf0ddII\uf0de :\n\n\uf0bb\n\nBVF anc\n\ni\nC\n\nRecoil/Antirecoil\n\n\uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e BVF \uf0bb \uf02b \uf0ddCVC \uf0b1 \uf0de BVF \uf0bbanc\nE,H,G \uf03f fields\n\ni\nW\n\nThis second stage of reaction of transition of [C] phase to [W] phase determines the\nempirical parameters of wave B of elementary particle. The relativistic effects are provided\n\uf0bb\nby the increasing of symmetry shift of the primary 'anchor' BVF anc with external\ntranslational velocity of particle. The effects, accompanied emission \uf0f0 absorption of\ncumulative virtual clouds \uf0ddCVC \uf0b1 \uf0de iF \uf0b1 and \uf0ddCVC \uf0b1 \uf0de iBVF \uf0bb on the 1st and 2nd stages of\n\uf0bb\n\nanc\n\n[C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation and rotation of triplets stand for origination of electric, magnetic and\ngravitational fields.\nThe 1st stage of particle duality is a consequence of the rest mass influence on dynamics of\nfermions. In the case of bosons, like photons, propagating in space with light velocity, the\ncontribution of the rest mass and 1st stage to process is negligible. The mechanism of photon\nduality is determined by the 2nd stage only. In general case the process of [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0\npulsation is accompanied by reversible conversion of rotational energy of elementary\nparticles in [C] phase to their translational energy in [W] phase.\nIt is shown, that Principle of least action is a consequence of forced combinational\nresonance of elementary particles and quantized virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1,2,3 \uf0de i of\nBivacuum. The latter provides propagation of wave packet of particle in [W] phase between\nactivated secondary anchor sites, where the [C] phase is realized.\nThe mechanism of microscopic and macroscopic quantum entanglement between remote\ni\ncoherent particles via bundles of Virtual Guides \uf0dfN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\uf0e0 x,y,z of\nspin, momentum and energy is proposed also. The VirG iSME represent quasi\none-dimensional Bose condensate, assembled form Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions\n[BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 i or Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de i . The tuning of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of\ni\nparticles, necessary for entanglement is realized under VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1,2,3 action. The bundles\nof Virtual Guides in superfluid Bivacuum have some similarity with vortical filaments in\nsuperfluid liquid helium and can be activated by rotating elementary particles.\nIt is demonstrated, that the charge and spin equilibrium oscillation in Bivacuum matrix in\nform of spherical elastic waves, provide the electric and magnetic fields origination. These\nexcitations are the consequence of reversible diverging \uf0f0 converging of Cumulative\nVirtual Clouds (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de, involving the recoil\uf0f0 antirecoil effects, accompanied\n\n\f5\n\uf0dfCorpuscle \uf0ef Wave\uf0e0 pulsation of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions of triplets and their\nfast rotation. The particle recoil\uf0f0 antirecoil oscillation of elementary particles, responsible\nfor electromagnetism and gravitation, are induced by their \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation. The most\nprobable velocity of these oscillation for the rest mass or zero-point conditions where\ncalculated.\nThe tendency of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions of opposite spins and charges to\n\uf0b7\nformation of Cooper pairs [BVF \uf02b \uf039 BVF \uf0b9\uf03f \uf0e0 ias , decreasing the resulting Bivacuum dipoles\nasymmetry with decreasing the separation between particles of opposite charges, is\nresponsible for Coulomb attraction between particles. The Coulomb repulsion between\nparticles of similar sign of charge is also a result of Bivacuum to decrease its resulting\nasymmetry in space between charges by increasing the separation.\nThe mechanism of Pauli repulsion between triplets of similar spins is shown to be a\nconsequence of the effect of excluded volume, tending to be occupied by two CVC \uf0b1 at the\nsame time emitted by unpaired sub-elementary fermions of the same phase of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0\npulsation. The energy of Pauli repulsion is about 1/\uf04a \uf070 137 times stronger, that Coulomb\ninteraction. The Pauli repulsion is most effective on the distances between fermions equal or\nless than de Broglie wave length of these particles: \uf056 B \uf03d h/p.\nThe magnetic field and N or S poles origination is a result of shift of equilibrium\n[BVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0 BVB \uf0b1 \uf0f0 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 to the left or right, correspondingly, depending on clockwise or\nanticlockwise rotation of triplets. The direction of fermions rotation is correlated with\ndirection of their propagation and sign of charge. The magnetic poles attraction or repulsion,\nlike in the case of Coulomb interaction is also dependent on possibility of Cooper pairs of\nBivacuum dipoles in space between them to assembly or disassembly. However, this process\ncan be independent on the internal symmetry shifts between torus and antitorus of BVF \uf0b7 or\nBVF \uf0b9 , responsible for electric field.\nThe gravitational waves and G-field are the result of positive and negative energy virtual\npressure waves excitation (VPW \uf02bq and VPW \uf03fq \uf0de i by the in-phase \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation of\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0d7, counterphase with pulsation of paired ones\n\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 i in elementary particles. These virtual pressure waves provide the attraction or\nrepulsion/antigravitation between pulsing remote particles, depending on the phase shift of\ntheir pulsation. Our gravitation theory has a common with hydrodynamic Bjerknes attraction\nor repulsion force between pulsing spheres. The antigravitation generated by counterphase\n\uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation of unpaired sub-elementary fermion F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0d7 in very remote objects can be\nresponsible for mysterious negative pressure energy or dark energy. For the other hand, the\npotential positive/attraction gravitational energy of huge number of symmetric Bivacuum\ndipoles exists even in the absence of matter in the empty space. This energy can be provided\nby positive and negative virtual pressure waves, excited as a result of symmetric transitions\nof tori and antitori of BVF \uf0bb . These transitions, compensating the energy of each other, can\nbe considered as zero-point oscillation of Bivacuum dipoles, in contrast to zero-point\noscillation of elementary particles at T \uf03d 0, induced by their \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation. This\nattraction effect of 'dark matter', provided by these symmetric oscillation of Bivacuum\ndipoles, is determined by sum of the absolute values of energies of excited torus and\n\uf0bb\nantitorus of BVF q \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0 q :\nN\uf0b8\uf04b\n\nN\uf0b8\uf04b\n\nE 0G \uf03d \uf03e \uf04b i \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0de i c 2 \uf03d \uf03e \uf04b i m i0 c 2 \uf0dd2n \uf02b 1\uf0de\nThis gravitational energy of empty Bivacuum may be responsible for Casimir effect and\ndark matter effect. As far the energies of tori V \uf02bj\uf03fk and antitori V \uf03fj\uf03fk pulsation are in-phase,\nsymmetric and opposite by sign, they compensate each other and do not violate the energy\nconservation law.\nIt follows from our UT, that the pace of time for any closed system is determined by pace of\nkinetic energy change of this system particles. The new approach to time problem, based on\nBivacuum, as the Universal Reference Frame, is more advanced than that, following from\nrelativistic theory, based on Relative Reference Frames. The time of action in our formula is\ndependent not only on velocity of particle/object, but also on its acceleration. It works not\nonly for inertial systems, but also for inertialess conservative systems, which are much more\ncommon in Nature, than inertial. Our theory of time, as a part of Unified theory, explains the\nsame experiments, which where used for confirmation of special and general relativity,\notherwise.\nThe validity of Unified Theory is confirmed by logical coherence of many of its\n\n\f6\nconsequences and ability to explain a lot of important conventional and unconventional\nphenomena. Among the first scope are two-slit experiment, radiation of photons by\naccelerated charges, Michelson - Morley, Hefele-Keating and Pound-Rebeka experiments,\netc. The so-called 'paranormal' phenomena (incompatible with conventional paradigm), like\nKozyrev, Shnoll and Tiller data, remote genetic transmutations and psi phenomena,\ninvolving remote vision, remote healing, telepathy, telekinesis, etc. turns to 'normal' in the\nframework of UT.\nThe specific character of telepathic signal transmission from [S] to [R] may be provided by\nmodulation of VR SMT of microtubules by VR SDNA of sender's chromosomes and vice versa in\nneuron ensembles, responsible for subconsciousness, imagination and consciousness. It\nlooks, that in cells, including neurons, the system:\n[pair of orthogonal Centrioles \uf02b Chromosomes]\nstands for sending and receiving of specific genetic and neurons state active information via\ni\nbundles of \uf0dfN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\uf0e0 x,y,z . It is a crucial stage in proposed in our\nwork mechanism of Induced Remote Genetic Transmutation (RT), Induced Remote\nMorphogenesis (RM) and Remote Healing (RH), discovered experimentally by Dzang\n(1981) and Gariaev (2001). The resonance - most effective remote informational/energy\nexchange between two living organisms or psychics is dependent on corresponding 'tuning'\nof their [Centrioles \uf02b Chromosomes] systems and corresponding neuron ensembles. In\naccordance to our theory of elementary act of consciousness, the modulation of dynamics of\n[assembly \uf0f0 disassembly] of microtubules by influence on probability of cavitational\nfluctuations and corresponding \uf0dfgel \uf0f0 sol\uf0e0 transitions in the 'tuned' nerve cells ensembles in\n[Receiver] by directed mental activity of [Sender] can provide telepathic contact and remote\nviewing between [Sender] and [Receiver]. The mechanism of remote healing could be the\nsame, but the local targets in the body of patient [R] should not be necessarily the [MTs \uf02b\nDNA] systems of nerve cells, but those in cells of the ill organs: heart, liver, etc.\nThe telekinesis, as example of mind-matter interaction, should be accompanied by strong\ncollective nonequilibrium process (excitation) in the nerve system of Sender. Corresponding\nmomentum and kinetic energy are transmitted to 'Receiver' or 'Target' via multiple bundles\ni\nof Virtual Guides: \uf0dfN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\uf0e0 x,y,z , connecting [MTs\uf02bDNA] S,R of\n[S] and [R], which can be termed a Psi- channels.\nWe may conclude, that our UT is able to explain a lot of unconventional experimental data,\nlike Kozyrev, Shnoll and Tiller ones, remote genetic transmutation, remote vision,\nmind-matter interaction, etc. without contradictions with fundamental laws of Nature.

The spatial VRM(r) may stand for remote vision of psychic. The ability of enough\ncomplex system of VRM(t) to self-organization in nonequilibrium conditions, make it\npossible multiplication of primary VR not only in space but as well, in time in both time\ndirection - positive (evolution) and negative (devolution).

In asymmetric Dirac's vacuum its realm of negative energy is saturated with\ninfinitive number of electrons. However, it was assumed that these electrons, following\nPauli principle, have not any gravitational or viscosity effects. Positrons and electron in his\nmodel represent the 'holes', originated as a result of the electrons jumps in realm of\npositive energy over the energetic gap: \uf041 \uf03d 2m 0 c 2 . Currently it becomes clear, that the\nDirac type model of vacuum is not general enough to explain all known experimental data,\nfor example, the bosons emergency. The model of Bivacuum, presented in this paper and\nprevious works of this author (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000; 2004; 2005, 2006) is more\nadvanced. However, it use the same starting point of equal probability of positive and\nnegative energy, confined in each of Bivacuum elements, named Bivacuum dipoles.\nAspden (2003) introduced in his aether theory the basic unit, named Quon, as a pair of\nvirtual muons of opposite charges, i.e. [muon \uf02b antimuon]. This idea has some common\nwith our model of Bivacuum dipoles. Each dipole represents collective excitations of\nsub-quantum particles and antiparticles, composing vortical pair: torus \uf02b antitorus of\nopposite energy/mass, charge and magnetic moments with three Compton radiuses,\ncorresponding to three lepton generation: electron, muon and tauon (Kaivarainen,\n2004-2006).\nOur notions of strongly correlated torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of Bivacuum dipoles\nhave also some similarity with 'phytons', introduced by Akimov and Shipov for\nexplanation of torsion field action. After Akimov (1995): \"In non polarized condition,\nphysical vacuum contains in each of its elements a phyton, which is a kind of circle shape two wave packets, which are rotating in opposite directions, corresponding to right and left\nspin. Primarily phytons are compensated, as far the sum of their angular momentums is\nzero. This is a reason, why the vacuum does not manifest nonzero angular momentum. But,\nif in the vacuum the spinning object appears, then the phytons, with axes of rotation,\ncoinciding with that of the object, will keep the same rotation, and phytons which'\nrotational axes were originally in the opposite direction, will be inverted partly under the\ninfluence of the spinning object.\nTwo subclasses of Bivacuum dipoles where introduced: Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de S\uf03d0\nwith torus and antitorus, rotating in opposite direction and virtual Cooper pairs of\nBivacuum fermions and antifermions with torus \uf02b antitorus both rotating clockwise or\nanticlockwise, correspondingly [BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0,\uf0b11.. . The ability of Bivacuum dipoles to\nform virtual Bose condensate from the bundles of quasi one-dimensional virtual\nmicrotubules (single and doubled) is demonstrated in our theory. These bundles, like\nvortical structures in liquid 4 He and 3 He (superfluid turbulence), makes it possible consider\nBivacuum as a two component liquid with superfluid and normal properties. The superfluid\nmodel of vacuum, composed from pairs of fermions of opposite spins and charge where\ndiscussed earlier by Sinha et. al., (1976; 1976a; 1978) and also by Boldyreva and Sotina\n(1999).\nIn accordance with Planck aether hypothesis of Winterberg (2002), the vacuum is a\nsuperfluid made up of positive and negative Planck mass particles. The Planck mass plasma\nmodel makes the following assumptions:\n1. The ultimate building blocks are positive and negative Planck mass particles. The\ninteraction obeys the laws of Newtonian mechanics, except for lex tertia, which under the\nassumed force law is violated during the collision between a positive and a negative Planck\nmass particle. The violation of the lex tertia means that during the mutually attractive\ncollision between a positive and a negative Planck mass particle, the momentum, not the\n\n\f10\nenergy, fluctuates. This establishes Heisenberg uncertainty principle at the most\nfundamental level, explaining why quantum mechanics can be derived from the Planck\nmass plasma.\n2. A Planck mass particles of the same sign repel and those of opposite sign attract each\n2\nother, with the magnitude and range of the force equal to the Planck force M P c /R P \uf03d c 4 /G\nand the Planck length R P \uf03d h/\uf0ddM P c).\n3. Space - vacuum is filled with an equal number of positive and negative Planck mass\nparticles whereby each Planck length volume is in the average occupied by one Planck\nmass particle. The collision of positive and negative Plank mass particles is a source of\nzitterbewegung in Winterberg model of vacuum.\nIn its ground state the Planck aether is a two component positive-negative mass\nsuperfluid with a phonon - roton energy spectrum for each component. Assuming that the\nphonon - roton spectrum measured in superfluid helium is universal, this would mean that\nin the Planck aether this spectrum has the same shape.\nRotons can be viewed as small vortex rings with the ring radius of the same order as the\nvortex core radius. A fluid with cavitons is in a state of negative pressure, and the same is\ntrue for a fluid with vortex rings. In vortices the centrifugal force creates a vacuum in the\nvortex core, making a vortex ring to behave like a caviton.\nIn Winterberg model the positive and negative Plank masses are not considered as a\nunified mass dipoles with possibility of polarization and symmetry shift. The mechanism of\norigination of mass, charge, magnetic moment and spin of elementary particles, the\nbackground of three lepton generation where not analyzed and proposed.\nNonetheless of some common features with models of Aspden, Akimov - Shipov's '\nand Winterberg, the concept of Bivacuum and it elements: Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de and\nfermions (BVF \uf0bb \uf0de is more advanced. It explains the origination of mass and chargeof\nsub-elementary fermions, as a result of torus V \uf02b and antitorus V \uf03f of Bivacuum dipoles\nsymmetry shift, the mechanism of corpuscle \uf0f0 wave pulsation and fusion of elementary\nparticles from triplets of sub-elementary fermions and antifermions. The electric, magnetic\nand gravitational fields are shown to be a result of elastic recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil effects and\nzitterbewegung, induced by these pulsation in Bivacuum matrix. In the framework of our\napproach all fundamental physical phenomena are hierarchically interrelated and unified.\nDavid Bohm was the first one, who made an attempt to explain wholeness of the\nUniverse, without loosing the causality principle. Experimental discovery:\n\"Aharonov-Bohm effect\" (1950) pointing that electron is able to \"feel\" the presence of a\nmagnetic field even in a regions where the probability of field existing is zero, was\nstimulating. For explanation of nonlocality Bohm introduced in 1952 the notion of quantum\npotential, which pervaded all of space. But unlike gravitational and electromagnetic fields,\nits influence did not decrease with distance. All the particles are interrelated by very\nsensitive to any perturbations quantum potential. This means that signal transmission\nbetween particles may occur instantaneously. The idea of quantum potential or active\ninformation is close to notion of pilot wave, proposed by de Broglie at the Solvay Congress\nin 1927. In fact, Bohm develops the de Broglie idea of pilot wave, applying it for\nmany-body system.\nIn 1957 Bohm published a book: Causality and Chance in Modern Physics. Later he\ncomes to conclusion, that Universe has a properties of giant, flowing hologram. Taking into\naccount its dynamic nature, he prefer to use term: holomovement. In his book: Wholeness\nand the Implicate Order (1980) he develops an idea that our explicated unfolded reality is a\nproduct of enfolded (implicated) or hidden order of existence. He consider the\nmanifestation of all forms in the universe, as a result of enfolding and unfolding exchange\nbetween two orders, determined by super quantum potential.\n\n\f11\nIn book, written by D. Bohm and B. Hiley (1993): \"THE UNDIVIDED UNIVERSE.\nAn ontological interpretation of quantum theory\" the electron is considered, as a particle\nwith well- defined position and momentum which are, however, under influence of special\nwave (quantum potential). Elementary particle, in accordance with these authors, is a\nsequence of incoming and outgoing waves, which are very close to each other. However,\nparticle itself does not have a wave nature. Interference pattern in double slit experiment\nafter Bohm is a result of periodically \"bunched\" character of quantum potential.\nAfter Bohm, the manifestation of corpuscle - wave duality of particle is dependent on\nthe way, which observer interacts with a system. He claims that both of this properties are\nalways enfolded in particle. It is a basic difference with our model, assuming that the wave\nand corpuscle phase are realized alternatively with high frequency during two different\nsemiperiods of sub-elementary particles, forming particles in the process of quantum beats\nbetween sublevels of positive (actual) and negative (complementary) energy. This\nfrequency is amplitude and phase modulated by experimentally revealed de Broglie wave of\nparticles.\nThe important point of Bohmian philosophy, coinciding with our concept, is that\neverything in the Universe is a part of dynamic continuum. Neurophysiologist Karl Pribram\ndoes made the next step in the same direction as Bohm: \"The brain is a hologram enfolded\nin a holographic Universe\".\nThe good popular description of Bohm and Pribram ideas are presented in books: \"The\nBell's theorem and the curious quest for quantum reality\" (1990) by David Peat and \"The\nHolographic Universe\" (1992) by Michael Talbot. Such original concepts are interesting\nand stimulating, indeed, but should be considered as a first attempts to transform intuitive\nperception of duality and quantum wholeness into clear geometrical and mathematical\nmodels.\nSome common features with our and Bohm-Hiley models has a Unitary Quantum\nTheory (UQT), proposed by Sapogin (1982). In the UQT any elementary particle is not a\npoint and source of field like in the ordinary quantum mechanics, but represents a wave\npacket of a certain unified field (Sapogin and Boichenko, 1991). The dispersion equation of\nsuch a nonlinear field turned out to be such, that the wave packet (particle) during its\nmovement periodically appears and disappears, and the envelope of this process coincides\nwith the de Broglie wave. Numerous particles during their periodic disappearance\n(spreading in the Universe) and repeated appearance represent vacuum fluctuations. The\ncorresponding transversal self-focusing of the wave packet is possible only in conditions if\nthe refraction index of space/vacuum is dependent of particle velocity. The square of wave\npacket describes the oscillating charged particle mass and energy (Sapogin, et.al., 2002),\nfollowing the conventional Newton equations. The essential in UQT is the absence of the\nenergy and the momentum conservation laws for single particles.\nIn 1950 John Wheeler and Charles Misner published Geometrodynamics, a new\ndescription of space-time properties, based on topology. Topology is more general than\nEuclidean geometry and deeper than non-Euclidean, used by Einstein in his General theory\nof relativity. Topology does not deal with distances, angles and shapes. Drawn on a sheet of\nstretching rubber, a circle, triangle and square are indistinguishable. A ball, pyramid and a\ncube also can be transformed into the other. However, objects with holes in them can never\nbe transformed by stretching and deforming into objects without holes. For example black\nhole can be described in terms of topology. It means that massive rotating body behave as a\nspace-time hole. Wheeler supposed that elementary particles and antiparticles, their spins,\npositive and negative charges can be presented as interconnected black and white holes.\nPositron and electron pair correspond to such model. The energy, directed to one of the\nhole, goes throw the connecting tube -\"handle\" and reappears at the other. The connecting\n\n\f12\ntube exist in another space-time than holes itself. Such a tube is undetectable in normal\nspace and the process of energy transmission looks as instantaneous. In conventional\nspace-time two ends of tube, termed 'wormholes' can be a vast distant apart. It gives an\nexplanation of quantum nonlocality.\nThe same is true for introduced in our theory nonlocal Virtual spin-momentum-energy\nguides (VirG SME \uf0de. The mono or paired VirG SME , formed by Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de or\nCooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions, correspondingly, may connect not only particles and\nantiparticles, like positrons and electrons, but also the same kind of particles (electrons,\nprotons, neutrons) with opposite spins and 'tuned' frequency of Corpuscle \uf0f0 Wave\npulsation.\nSidharth (1998, 1999) considered elementary particle as a relativistic vortex of\nCompton radius, from which he recovered its mass and quantized spin \uf0dds \uf03d 12 \uf0a4\uf0de. He\npictured a particle as a fluid vortex steadily circulating with light velocity along a 2D ring\nor spherical 3D shell with radius\nL\uf03d\n\n\uf0a4\n2mc\n\n1\n\nInside such vortex the notions of negative energy, superluminal velocities and nonlocality\nare acceptable without contradiction with conventional theory.\nBohm's hydrodynamic formulation and substitution\n\uf066 \uf03d Re iS\n\n2\n\nwhere R and S are real function of r and t, transforms the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to\n\uf02f\uf05f\n\uf02b \uf034\uf0dd\uf05fv\uf0de \uf03d 0\n\uf02ft\n2\n2\nor : \uf0a4 \uf02fS \uf02b \uf0a4 \uf0dd\uf034S\uf0de 2 \uf02b V \uf03d \uf0a4 \uf0dd\uf034 2 R/R\uf0de \uf0af Q\n2m\n2m\n\uf02ft\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n2\n\n\uf0a4\n\uf0a4\nwhere: \uf05f \uf03d R 2 ; v \uf03d 2m\n\uf034S and Q \uf03d 2m\n\uf0dd\uf034 2 R/R\uf0de\nSidharth comes to conclusion that the energy of nonlocal quantum potential (Q) is\ndetermined by inertial mass (m) of particle:\n2\nQ \uf0af \uf03f \uf0a4 \uf0dd\uf034 2 R/R\uf0de \uf03d mc 2\n2m\n\nHe treated also a charged Dirac fermions, as a Kerr-Newman black holes. Within the\nregion of Compton vortex the superluminal velocity and negative energy are possible after\nSidharth. If measurements are averaged over time t ~ mc 2 /\uf0a4 and over space L ~ \uf0a4/mc, the\nimaginary part of particle's position disappears and we are back in usual Physics (Sidharth,\n1998).\nBarut and Bracken (1981) considered zitterbewegung - rapidly oscillating imaginary\npart of particle position, leading from Dirac theory (1947), as a harmonic oscillator in the\nCompton wavelength region of particle. The Einstein (1971, 1982) and Shr\u00f6dinger (1930)\nalso spoke about oscillation of the electron with frequency: \uf058 \uf03d m 0 c 2 /h and the amplitude:\n\uf051 max \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0dd2mc\uf0de. It was demonstrated by Shr\u00f6dinger, that position of free electron can be\npresented as: x \uf03d x \uf02b \uf051, where x characterize the average position of the free electron, and\n\uf051 its instant position, related to its oscillations. Hestness (1990) proposed, that\nzitterbewegung arises from self-interaction, resulting from wave-particle duality.\nThis ideas are close to our explanation of elementary particles zero-point oscillations, as\na recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil vibrations, accompanied corpuscle \uf0ef wave pulsations. Corresponding\n\n5\n\n\f13\noscillations of each particle kinetic energy, in accordance to our theory of time\n(Kaivarainen, 2005), is related with oscillations of instant time for this closed system. We\ncame here to concept of space-time-energy discreet trinity, generated by corpuscle \uf03f wave\nduality.\nSerious attack on problem of quantum nonlocality was performed by Roger Penrose\n(1989) with his twister theory of space-time. After Penrose, quantum phenomena can\ngenerate space-time. The twisters, proposed by him, are lines of infinite extent, resembling\ntwisting light rays. Interception or conjunction of twistors lead to origination of particles. In\nsuch a way the local and nonlocal properties and particle-wave duality are interrelated in\ntwistors geometry. The analysis of main quantum paradoxes was presented by Asher Peres\n(1992) and Charles Bennett et. al., (1993).\nIn our Unified model the local properties of sub-elementary particles are resulted from\ntheir Bivacuum symmetry shift, accompanied by their uncompensated mass and charge\norigination. The nonlocal interaction of two or more particles of the same kinds (photons,\nelectrons, protons, neutrons) in state of entanglement, are the consequence of Bivacuum\ngap oscillation between torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of BVF \uf0bb , BVB \uf0b1 and corresponding\npulsation of radiuses of BVB \uf0b1 or Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions [BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0.\nThis kind of signals are mediated by quasi one-dimensional Bose condensation of\nBivacuum dipoles, assembling virtual guides (VirG SME \uf0de of spin, momentum and energy,\nconnecting these particles with close frequency and phase of [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation.\nThe quite different approach, using computational derivation of quantum relativistic\nsystems with forward-backward space-time shifts, developed by Daniel Dubois (1999), led\nto some results, similar to ours (Kaivarainen, 1995, 2001, 2003, 2004). For example, the\ngroup and phase masses, introduced by Dubois, related to internal group and phase\nvelocities, has analogy with actual and complementary masses, introduced in our Unified\ntheory (UT). In both approaches, the product of these masses is equal to the particle's rest\nmass squared. The notion of discrete time interval, used in Dubois approach, may\ncorrespond to PERIOD of [C \uf0f0 W] pulsation of sub-elementary particles in UT. The\npositive internal time interval, in accordance to our model, corresponds to forward\nC \uf0b8 W transition and the negative one to the backward W \uf0b8 C transition.\nPuthoff (2001) developed the idea of 'vacuum engineering', using hypothesis of\npolarizable vacuum (PV). The electric permittivity (\uf050 0 \uf0de and magnetic permeability (\uf057 0 \uf0de is\ninterrelated in 'primordial' symmetric vacuum, as: \uf050 0 \uf057 0 \uf03d 1/c 2 . It is shown that changing of\nvacuum refraction index: n \uf03d c/v \uf03d \uf050 1/2 , for example in gravitational or electric potentials,\nis accompanied by variation of lot of space-time parameters.\nFock (1964) and Puthoff (2001), explained the bending of light beam, induced by\ngravitation near massive bodies also by vacuum refraction change, i.e. in another way, than\nGeneral theory of relativity. However, the mechanism of vacuum polarization and\ncorresponding refraction index changes in electric and gravitational fields remains obscure.\nOur Unified theory propose such mechanism (see section 8.11).\nThe transformation of neutron to proton and electron, in accordance to Electro - Weak\n(EW) theory, developed by Glashov (1961), Weinberg (1967) and Salam (1968), is\nmediated by negative massless W \uf03f boson. The reverse reaction in EW theory: proton \uf0b8\nneutron is mediated by positive massless W \uf02b boson. Scattering of the electron on neutrino,\nnot accompanied by charge transferring, is mediated by third massless neutral boson Z 0 .\nIn (EW) theory the Higgs field was introduced for explanation of spontaneous\nsymmetry violation of intermediate vector bosons: charged W \uf0b1 and neutral Z 0 with spin 1,\naccompanied by origination of big mass of these particles. The EW theory needs also the\nquantum of Higgs field, named Higgs bosons with big mass, zero charge and integer spin.\nThe fusion of Higgs bosons with W \uf0b1 and Z 0 particles is accompanied by increasing of their\n\n\f14\nmass up to 90 mass of protons. The experimental discovery of heavy W \uf0b1 and Z 0 particles in\n1983 after their separation, accompanied getting the system a big external energy, was\nconsidered as a conformation of EW theory.\nThe spontaneous symmetry violation of vacuum, in accordance to Goldstone theorem,\nturns two virtual particles with imaginary masses (im\uf0de to one real particle with mass:\nM 1 \uf03d 2 m and one real particle with zero mass: M 2 \uf03d 0. However, the Higgs field and\nHiggs bosons are still not found. \"We have eliminated most of hunting area\", confirms Neil\nCalder from CERN recently. This author propose another explanation of mass and charge\norigination.\nIn conventional approach, described above, two parameters of W \uf0b1 particles, like charge\nand mass are considered, as independent.\nThomson, Heaviside and Searl supposed that mass is an electrical phenomena. In theory\nof Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff (1994), Rueda and Haish (1998) it was proposed, that the\ninertia is a reaction force, originating in a course of dynamic interaction between the\nelectromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) of vacuum and charge of elementary particles.\nHowever, it's not clear in this approach, how the charge itself originates.\nOur Unified theory is an attempt to unify mass and charge with magnetic moment, spin\nand symmetry shift of sub-elementary fermions, induced by external translational-rotational\nmotion (see chapter 4). This theory unifies the origination of elementary particles, their rest\nmass and charge, electromagnetism and gravitation with particles corpuscle-wave duality,\nstanding also for their zero-point oscillations. In accordance to formalism of our theory, the\nrest mass and charge of elementary fermions origination are both the result of Bivacuum\nfermions (BVF) symmetry shift, corresponding to Golden mean conditions, i.e. equality of\nthe ratio of external velocity of BVF to light velocity squared to: \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf03d 0. 618 \uf03d \uf064. At\nthis condition the asymmetric Bivacuum dipole turns to sub-elementary fermion. The\nelectric, magnetic and gravitational fields are the result of huge number of Bivacuum\ndipoles symmetry shift oscillation, excited by recoil\uf0f0 antirecoil dynamics, accompanied\nthe corpuscle \uf0f0 wave pulsation of sub-elementary particles, forming the elementary\nparticles (chapter 8).\nIn our approach, the resistance of particle to acceleration (i.e. inertia force),\nproportional to its mass (second Newton's law) is a consequence of resistance of frequency\nof particle's C \uf0f0 W pulsation to change, keeping the equilibrium (tuned state) with\nfrequency of surrounding Bivacuum dipoles symmetry - energy oscillation. We named this\nresistance to equilibrium shift between dynamics of particles and dynamics of Bivacuum \"The generalized principle of Le Chatelier's\".\nIn contrast to nonlocal Mach's principle, our theory of particle - Bivacuum interaction\nexplains the existence of inertial mass of even single particle in empty Universe.\nThe main goals of our work can be formulated as follows:\n1. Development of superfluid Bivacuum model, as the dynamic matrix of dipoles,\nformed by pairs of virtual torus and antitorus of the opposite energy/mass, charge and\nmagnetic moments, compensating each other. The explanation of fusion of the electrons,\npositrons, muons, protons, neutrons and photons, as a triplets of asymmetric Bivacuum\nsub-elementary fermions of tree lepton generation (e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de.

The validation of Unified Theory, based on logical coherence of many of its\nconsequences and ability to explain a lot of fundamental not only the conventional, but as\nwell the unconventional/paranormal experimental results, including getting the free energy\nfrom Bivacuum, cold fusion, etc.\n1. New Hierarchical Model of Bivacuum, as a Superfluid Multi-Dipole Structure\n1.1. Properties of Bivacuum dipoles - Bivacuum fermions and Bivacuum bosons\nThe Bivacuum concept is a result of new interpretation and development of Dirac\ntheory (Dirac, 1958), pointing to equal probability of positive and negative energy in\nNature.\nThe Bivacuum is introduced, as a dynamic superfluid matrix of the Universe, composed\nfrom non-mixing subquantum particles of opposite polarization and three nonquantized\nspin values, separated by an energy gap. The hypothetical microscopic subquantum\nparticles and antiparticles have a dimensions about or less than (10 \uf03f19 m), zero mass, spin\nand charge. They spontaneously self-organize in infinite number of mesoscopic paired\nvortices - Bivacuum dipoles of three generations with Compton radii, corresponding to\nelectrons (e), muons (\uf057\uf0de and tauons (\uf062\uf0de, corresponding to three different spin values. Only\nsuch mesoscopic collective excitations of subquantum particles in form of pairs of rotating\nfast torus and antitorus are quantized. In turn, these Bivacuum 'molecules' compose the\nmacroscopic superfluid ideal liquid, representing the infinitive Bivacuum matrix.\nEach of two strongly correlated 'donuts' of Bivacuum dipoles acquire the opposite mass\ncharge and magnetic moments, compensating each other in the absence of symmetry shift\nbetween them. The latter condition is valid only for symmetric primordial Bivacuum,\nwhere the influence of matter and fields on Bivacuum is negligible.\nThe symmetric primordial Bivacuum can be considered as the Universal Reference\nFrame (URF), i.e. Ether, in contrast to Relative Reference Frame (RRF), used in special\nrelativistic (SR) theory. The elements of Ether - ethons correspond to our Bivacuum\n\n\f16\ndipoles.

In primordial Bivacuum the energies of opposite\nvirtual pressure waves totally compensate each other: VPW \uf02bq \uf02b VPW \uf03fq \uf03d 0. However, in\nasymmetric secondary Bivacuum, in presence of matter and fields, the total compensation\nis absent and the resulting virtual pressure is nonzero (Kaivarainen, 2005):\n\uf0dd\uf041VirP \uf0b1 \uf03d |VirP \uf02b | \uf03f |VirP \uf03f |\uf0de \uf03e 0.\nIn accordance with our model of Bivacuum, virtual particles and antiparticles represent\nthe asymmetric Bivacuum dipoles \uf0ddBVF \uf0bb \uf0de as and \uf0ddBVB \uf0b1 \uf0de as of three electron generations\n(i \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de in unstable state, not corresponding to Golden mean conditions (see section\n2.1). Virtual particles and antiparticles are the result of correlated and opposite Bivacuum\ndipole symmetry fluctuations. Virtual particles, like the real sub-elementary particles, may\nexist in Corpuscular and Wave phases (see section 5). The Corpuscular [C]- phase,\n\n\f18\nrepresents strongly correlated pairs of asymmetric torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of two\ndifferent by absolute values energies. The Wave [W]- phase, results from quantum beats\nbetween these states, which are accompanied by emission or absorption of Cumulative\nVirtual Clouds (CVC \uf02b or CVC \uf03f \uf0de, formed by subquantum particles.\nVirtual particles have a mass, charge, spin, etc., but they differs from real\nsub-elementary ones by their lower stability (short life-time) and inability for fusion to\nstable triplets (see section 3). They are a singlets or very unstable triplets or other clusters\nof Bivacuum dipoles (BVF \uf0bb ) as in contrast to real fermions-triplets.\nFor Virtual Clouds (VC \uf0b1 \uf0de and virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf0b1 \uf0de excited by them, the\nrelativistic mechanics is not valid. Consequently, the causality principle also does not work\nin a system (interference pattern) of VPW \uf0b1 .\nThe energies of positive and negative VPW \uf02bq and VPW \uf03fq , emitted \uf0f0 absorbed by\nBivacuum dipoles, as a result of their torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f\uf0de transitions between j\nand k quantum states can be presented as:\nE iVPW \uf02bq \uf03d \uf0a4\uf067 i0 \uf0ddj \uf03f k\uf0de V \uf02b \uf03d m i0 c 2 \uf0ddj \uf03f k\uf0de\n\n1.6\n\nE iVPW \uf03fq \uf03d \uf03f\uf0a4\uf067 i0 \uf0ddj \uf03f k\uf0de V \uf03f \uf03d \uf03fm i0 c 2 \uf0ddj \uf03f k\uf0de\n\n1.6a\n\nThe quantized fundamental Compton frequency of VPW \uf0b1q is:\nq \uf067 i0 \uf03d q m i0 c 2 /\uf0a4\n\n1.7\n\nwhere: q \uf03d j \uf03f k \uf03d 1, 2, 3. . is the quantization number of VPW \uf0b1j,k energy;\nIn symmetric primordial Bivacuum the total compensation of positive and negative\nVirtual Pressure Waves takes a place:\nqE iVPW \uf02bj,k \uf03d \uf03fqE iVPW \uf03fj,k \uf03d q \uf0a4\uf067 i0\n\n1.8\n\nThis means that the coherent excitation of VPW \uf02bj,k and VPW \uf03fj,k do not violate the\nenergy conservation law.

The\nFalaco vertex is a topological defect in a viscous fluid, but due to its coherence it can form\na long-lived metastable state in which two opposite spins are paired together.

The Bivacuum nonlocal properties can be proved, using the Virial theorem\n(Kaivarainen, 2004, 2005).\n1.3 Virtual Bose condensation (VirBC), as a base of Bivacuum\nsuperfluid properties and nonlocality\nIt follows from our model of Bivacuum, that the infinite number of Cooper pairs of\nBivacuum fermions \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 iS\uf03d0 and their intermediate states - Bivacuum bosons\n(BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de i , as elements of Bivacuum, have zero or very small (in presence of fields and\nmatter) translational momentum: p iBVF \uf0b7 \uf039BVF \uf0b9 \uf03d p iBVB \uf0b8 0 and corresponding de Broglie\nwave length tending to infinity: \uf056 iVirBC \uf03d h/p iBVF \uf0b7 \uf039BVF \uf0b9 , BVB \uf0b8 \uf04b. It leads to origination of\n3D net of virtual adjacent pairs of double virtual microtubules from Cooper pairs\n\uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 , and (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de S\uf03d0 , which may form single microtubules. The longitudinal\n\n\f20\nmomentum of Bivacuum dipoles forming such virtual microfilaments and their\nbundles/beams can be close to zero and corresponding de Broglie wave length exceeding\nthe distance between neighboring dipoles lot of times. Consequently, the 3D system of\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b9\n\uf0b1\nthese twin and single microtubules, termed Virtual Guides \uf0ddVirG BVF \uf039BVF and VirG BVB \uf0de,\nrepresent Bose condensate with superfluid properties. Consequently Bivacuum, like liquid\nhelium, can be considered as a liquid, containing two components: the described superfluid\nand normal, representing fraction of Bivacuum dipoles not involved in virtual guides\n(VirG). The radiuses of VirG are determined by the Compton radiuses of the electrons,\nmuons and tauons. Their length is limited by decoherence effects, related to Bivacuum\nsymmetry shift. In highly symmetric Bivacuum the length of VirG with nonlocal\nproperties, connecting remote coherent elementary particles, may have the order of stars\nand galactics separation. However, the virtual microfilaments of VirG may form also a\nclosed - ring like rotating structures with perimeter, determined by resulting de Broglie\nwave length of this ring elements. The life-time of such closed structures can be very big,\nas far they represent standing and non dissipating virtual de Broglie waves of Bivacuum\ndipoles.\nNonlocality, as the independence of potential energy on the distance from energy\nsource in 3D net filaments of virtual (and real) Bose condensate, follows from application\nof the Virial theorem to systems of Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0\nand Bivacuum bosons \uf0ddBVB \uf0b1 \uf0de (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2004-2006).\nThe Virial theorem in general form is correct not only for classical, but also for\n\uf033\uf0de \uf03d\uf03e m i v 2i /2 and potential V\uf0ddr\uf0de\nquantum systems. It relates the averaged kinetic T k \uf0ddv\ni\n\nenergies of particles, composing these systems:\n\uf033\uf0de \uf03d\n2T k \uf0ddv\n\n\uf03e m i v 2i \uf03d \uf03e \uf033r i \uf02fV/\uf02fr\uf033i\ni\n\n1.12\n\ni\n\nIf the potential energy V\uf0ddr\uf0de is a homogeneous \uf06e \uf03f order function like:\nV\uf0ddr\uf0de \uf069 r \uf06e , then n \uf03d 2T k\nV\uf0ddr\uf0de\n\n1.12a\n\nFor example, for a harmonic oscillator, when T k \uf03dV, we have \uf06e \uf03d 2. For Coulomb\n\uf023 \uf03d \uf03fV\n\uf023 /2.\ninteraction: \uf06e \uf03d \uf03f1 and T\nThe important consequence of the Virial theorem is that, if the average kinetic energy\nand momentum ( p \uf0de of particles in a certain volume of a Bose condensate (BC) tends to\nzero:\nT k \uf03d p 2 /2m \uf0b8 0\n\n1.13\n\nthe interaction between particles in the volume of BC, characterized by the radius:\nL BC \uf03d \uf0dd\uf0a4/ p \uf0de \uf0b8 0, becomes nonlocal, as independent on distance between them:\nV\uf0ddr\uf0de \uf069 r \uf06e \uf03d 1 \uf03d const at\n\n\uf06e \uf03d 2T k /V\uf0ddr\uf0de \uf03d 0\n\nConsequently, it is shown, that nonlocality, as independence of potential on the distance\nfrom potential source, is the inherent property of macroscopic Bose condensate. The\nindividual particles (real, virtual or subquantum) in a state of Bose condensation are\nspatially indistinguishable due to the uncertainty principle. The Bivacuum dipoles\n\uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 and (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de S\uf03d0 due to quasi one-dimensional Bose condensation are\ntending to self-assembly by 'head-to-tail' principle. They compose very long virtual\n\n1.14\n\n\f21\nmicrotubules - Virtual Guides with wormhole properties. In special cases they form a\nclosed structures - rotating rings with radius, dependent on velocity of rotation. The 3D net\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b9\n\uf0b1\nof these two kind of Virtual Guides (double VirG BVF \uf039BVF and mono VirG BVB ) bundles\nrepresent the nonlocal and superfluid fraction of Bivacuum..\n2. Virtual Particles and Antiparticles\nGenerally accepted difference of virtual particles from the actual ones, is that the\nformer, in contrast to latter, does not follow the laws of relativistic mechanics:\nm0\nm\uf03d\n\uf0df1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf0e0 1/2\n\n2.1\n\nFor actual free particle with rest mass \uf0ddm 0 \uf0de and relativistic mass (m\uf0de, the formula,\nfollowing from (2.1) is:\n2\n\nE 2 \uf03f p c 2 \uf03d m 20 c 4\n\uf0b8\n\n2.2\n\uf0b8\n\nwhere E 2 \uf03d \uf0ddmc 2 \uf0de 2 is the total energy squared and p \uf03d m v is the momentum of\nparticle.\nIn accordance to our model of Bivacuum, virtual particles represent asymmetric\nBivacuum dipoles (BVF) as and (BVB\uf0de as of three electron's generation (i \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de in\nunstable state far from Golden mean conditions. Virtual particles, like the real\nsub-elementary particles, may exist in two phase: Corpuscular [C]- phase, representing\ncorrelated pairs of asymmetric torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of two different energy states\nand Wave [W]- phase, resulting from quantum beats between these states. Corresponding\ntransitions are accompanied by emission \uf0f0 absorption of Cumulative Virtual Cloud (CVC \uf02b\nor CVC \uf03f \uf0de, formed by subquantum particles and antiparticles. For virtual particles the\nequality (2.2) is invalid.\nVirtual particles differs from real sub-elementary ones by their lower stability (short\nand uncertain life-time) and inability for fusion to triplets, as far their symmetry shift,\ndetermined by their external velocity and corresponding relativistic effects are not big\nenough to follow the Golden Mean condition (see section 5).\nFor Cumulative Virtual Clouds (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de and excited by them periodic subquantum\nparticles and antiparticles density oscillation in Bivacuum - virtual pressure waves\n(VPW \uf0b1q \uf0de, the relativistic mechanics and equality (2.2) are not valid. Consequently, the\ncausality principle also do not works in a system of VPW \uf0b1q , representing oscillations of\nsubquantum particles density.\nThe [electron - proton] interaction is generally considered, as a result of virtual photons\nexchange (the cumulative virtual clouds CVC \uf0b1 exchange in terms of our theory- section\n13.2\uf0de, when the electron and proton total energies do not change. Only the directions of\ntheir momentums are changed. In this case the energy of virtual photon in the equation\n(2.2) E \uf03d 0 and:\n2\n\n2\n\nE 2 \uf03f p c 2 \uf03d \uf03fp c 2 \uf03c 0\n\n2.3\n\nThe measure of virtuality (Vir) is a measure of Dirac's relation validity:\n2\n\n\uf0ddVir\uf0de \uf069\uf050 m 20 c 4 \uf03f\uf0ddE 2 \uf03fp c 2 \uf0de \uf050\uf0b3 0\nIn contrast to actual particles, the virtual ones have a more limited radius of action. The\nmore is the virtuality (Vir), the lesser is the action radius. Each of emitted virtual quantum\n(virtual cloud) must be absorbed by the same particle or another in a course of their\n\n2.4\n\n\f22\n\uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsations.\nA lot of process in quantum electrodynamics can be illustrated by Feynman diagrams\n(Feynman, 1985). In these diagrams, actual particles are described as infinitive rays (lines)\nand virtual particles as stretches connecting these lines (Fig. 1).\nEach peak (or angle) in Feynman diagrams means emission or absorption of quanta or\nparticles. The energy of each process (electromagnetic, weak, strong) is described using\ncorrespondent fine structure constants.\n\nFig. 1.

It\nmeans, that increasing of mass/energy of the torus is compensated by in-phase decreasing\nof absolute values of these parameters for antitorus and vice versa:\n|\uf0b1m \uf02bV | |\uf040m \uf03fV | \uf03d m 20\n\n3.7\n\nTaking (3.7) and (3.1) into account, we get for the product of the internal group and\nphase velocities of positive and negative subquantum particles, forming torus and antitorus,\ncorrespondingly:\nin\n2\nv in\ngr v ph \uf03d c\n\n3.8\n\nA similar symmetric relation is reflecting the charge compensation principle:\n|e \uf02b | |e \uf03f | \uf03d e 20\n\n3.9\n\nThe sum of the actual (positive) and the complementary (negative) total energies of (3.5\n\uf0bb\nand 3.6), i.e. the resulting energy of Bivacuum fermion (BVF as \uf0de is equal to its doubled\nexternal kinetic energy, anisotropic in general case:\ni\n\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 \uf03d m \uf02bV v 2 \uf03d 2T k \uf03d\n\uf0b7\n\nm0v\n\n2\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\ni\n\n3.10\nx,y,z\n\nIn asymmetric Bivacuum fermions BVF as \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0ec V \uf03f and Bivacuum antifermions\ni\n\uf0b9\nBVF as \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0ee V \uf03f the actual and complementary torus and antitorus change their place,\nas well as relativistic dependence of their opposite mass and charge on the external velocity\nof Bivacuum dipoles (v). Similar exchange of the notions of the actual and complementary\ntorus and antitorus and their relativistic dependence on (v) takes a place for Bivacuum\nbosons of opposite polarization: \uf0ddBVB \uf02b \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0b7\uf0b9 V \uf03f \uf0de i and \uf0ddBVB \uf03f \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0b9\uf0b7 V \uf03f \uf0de i . We\nassume, that the actual mass of asymmetric dipoles of Bivacuum with regular relativistic\ndependence is always positive (like in conventional consideration of particles and\nantiparticles) and the uncompensated energy of Bivacuum dipoles is determined by the\nabsolute value of their mass symmetry shift.\nThe resulting energy of asymmetric Bivacuum antifermion and negatively polarized\nBivacuum boson, the formula (3.10) turns to shape:\n\n\f25\ni\n\n\uf0ddm \uf03fV \uf03f m \uf02bV \uf0dec 2 \uf03d m \uf03fV v 2 \uf03d 2T k \uf03d\n\nm0v\n\n2\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\nx,y,z\n\nwhere in contrast to (3.5) and (3.6), the relativistic dependences of torus and antitorus\nchange their place:\n\uf0b1 m \uf03fV \uf03d\n\nm0\n\uf0b1 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n(inertial mass)\n\n\uf040 m \uf02bV \uf03d \uf040m 0 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 (inertialess mass)\nThe fundamental Einstein equation for total energy of particle can be reformed and\nextended, using eqs. 3.10 and 3.7:\nE tot \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d mc 2 \uf03d m \uf03fV c 2 \uf02b m \uf02bV v 2\nm 20 2\nor : E tot \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d\nc \uf02b m \uf02bV v 2\nm \uf02bV\nor : E tot \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d\n\n3.10a\n3.10b\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 m 0 c 2 \uf02b 2T k\n\n3.10c\n\nThe ratio of absolute values (3.6) to (3.5), taking into account (3.7), is:\nm 20\n|\uf03fm \uf03fV |\n\uf03d\n\uf03d 1\uf03f\n\uf02b\nmV\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de 2\n\nv\nc\n\n2\n\n3.11\n\nIt can easily be transformed to the important formula for resulting external energy of\nBivacuum dipoles (3.10).\nThe opposite shift of symmetry between V \uf02b and V \uf03f of two Bivacuum fermions of\nopposite spins occur due to relativistic effects, accompanied their rotation side-by-side as a\nCooper pairs \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 as around the common axe.

The\nresulting mass/energy, charge and spin of Cooper pairs [F \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 is zero because of\ncompensation effects.\nOn the other hand, two adjacent asymmetric Bivacuum fermions and antifermions of\nsimilar direction of rotation and similar semi-integer spins can not rotate 'side-by-side',\nlike in Cooper pairs: \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 as , compensating each other, but only as\n'head-to-tail' complexes in clockwise or anticlockwise directions:\nN \uf02b \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf02b BVF \uf0b7 \uf0e0 as or N \uf03f \uf0dfBVF \uf0b9 \uf02b BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 as\nIn such bosonic configuration, corresponding to integer spin, the energy/ mass, charge and\nhalf-integer spin of the Bivacuum dipoles, are the additive values.\nAs far in primordial Bivacuum the average mass/energy, charge and spin should be\nzero, it means that the number of 'head-to-tail' pairs of Bivacuum fermions with boson\nproperties is equal to similar bosonic pairs of Bivacuum antifermions: N \uf02b \uf03d N \uf03f .\n\n3.12\n\n\f26\nIn contrast to Bivacuum fermions, which may self-assemble to the doubled virtual\nmicrotubules only, the Bivacuum bosons may polymerize also into the mono filaments of\ntwo opposite polarization (\uf0b1\uf0de, as far it do not contradict the Pauli principle:\n\n\uf03e\uf0ddBVB \uf02b \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0b7\uf0b9 V \uf03f \uf0de i\n\nand\n\n\uf03e\uf0ddBVB \uf03f \uf03d V \uf02b \uf0b9\uf0b7 V \uf03f \uf0de i\n\n3.13\n\nIt follows from our model of elementary particles (chapter 5), that the described above\nopposite symmetry shift of paired side-by-side Bivacuum fermions, antifermions and\nBivacuum bosons of opposite polarization occur, as a result of their rotation around the\ncommon axes with tangential external velocity (v).\nThe 'head-to-tail' associated Bivacuum dipoles may form the straight/linear mono and\ndoubled virtual microtubules, connecting \"Sender\" and \"Receiver\" (virtual filaments).\nAnother possible configurations of Bivacuum dipoles self-assembly is a rotating\ncircles/rings with perimeter, equal de Broglie wave length of mono dipoles (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de as or\ntheir pairs \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 as , determined by their actual mass \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de i due to mass\ni\nsymmetry shift m \uf02bV \uf03fm \uf03fV , determined, in turn, by their tangential velocity (v) of ring\nrotation:\n\uf056 iVir \uf03d 2\uf05eL iVir \uf03d\n\nh\n\uf03d\np iBVB \uf0b1 ,BVF\n\nm \uf02bV\n\nh\n\uf03fm \uf03fV\n\ni\n\nc\n\n\uf03d\n\nhc\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de i v 2\n\n3.14\n\nThis condition corresponds to that of standing de Broglie wave of particle with mass\nand tangential velocity (v).\nFor single Bivacuum dipoles (BVF \uf0b7 , BVF \uf0b9 and BVF \uf0b1 \uf0de i , the conversion of their torus\n(V \uf02b \uf0de or antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de to the actual one depends on direction of Bivacuum dipoles\npropagation in direction, parallel to the main axes of dipoles rotation.

The light velocity in UT, like sound\nvelocity in the matter, is a function of Bivacuum (primary or secondary) matrix properties.\nThe relativistic dependences of the actual charge e \uf02b and actual mass (m \uf02bV \uf0de on external\nabsolute velocity of Bivacuum dipole, following from (4.2a) and (3.5) are:\ne0\n4.5\ne\uf02b \uf03d\n\uf0df1 \uf03f \uf0ddv 2 /c 2 \uf0de\uf0e0 1/4\nm0\n4.5a\nm \uf02bV \uf03d\n2\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de\nThe influence of relativistic dependence of real particles charge on the resulting charge\nand electric field density of Bivacuum, which is known to be electrically quasi neutral\nvacuum/bivacuum, is negligible for two reasons:\n1. Densities of positive and negative real charges (i.e. particles and antiparticles) are\nvery small and approximately equal. This quasi-equilibrium of opposite charges is Lorentz\ninvariant;\n2. The remnant uncompensated by real antiparticles charges density at any velocities\ncan be compensated totally by virtual antiparticles and asymmetric Bivacuum fermions\n(BVF) of opposite charges.\nThe ratio of the actual charge to the actual inertial mass from (4.5 and 4.5a) has also the\nrelativistic dependence:\n\n\f28\ne \uf02b \uf03d e 0 \uf0df1 \uf03f \uf0ddv 2 /c 2 \uf0de\uf0e0 1/4\nm0\nm \uf02bV\n\n4.6\n\nThe decreasing of this ratio with velocity increasing is weaker, than it follows from the\ngenerally accepted statement, that charge has no relativistic dependence in contrast to the\nactual mass m \uf02bV . The direct experimental investigation of relativistic dependence of this\nratio on the external velocity (v) may confirm the validity of our formula (4.6) and general\napproach.\nFrom eqs. (3.10); (3.13) and (3.13a) we find for mass and charge symmetry shift:\nv\nc\n\n\uf041m \uf0b1 \uf03d m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf03d m \uf02bV\ne2\n\uf041e \uf0b1 \uf03d e \uf02b \uf03f e \uf03f \uf03d e \uf02b\uf02b e\n\uf02b\n\uf03f\n\n2\n\nv\nc\n\n4.7\n2\n\n4.7a\n\nThese mass and charge symmetry shifts determines the relativistic dependence of the\neffective mass and charge of the fermions. In direct experiments only the actual mass (m \uf02bV \uf0de\nand charge (e \uf0b1 \uf0de can be registered. It means that the complementary mass (m \uf03fV \uf0de and charge\nare hidden for observation.\nThe ratio of charge to mass symmetry shifts (the effective charge and mass ratio) is:\ne 2\uf02b\n\uf041e \uf0b1 \uf03d\n\uf041m \uf0b1\nm \uf02bV \uf0dde \uf02b \uf02b e \uf03f \uf0de\n\n4.8\n\nThe mass symmetry shift can be expressed via the squared charges symmetry shift also\nin the following manner:\n\uf041m \uf0b1 \uf03d m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf03d m \uf02bV\n\ne 2\uf02b \uf03f e 2\uf03f\ne 2\uf02b\n\n4.8a\n\nor using (3.11) this formula turns to:\ne 2\uf02b \uf03f e 2\uf03f\nv2\n\uf03d\ne 2\uf02b\nc2\n\n4.9\n\nWhen the mass and charge symmetry shifts of Bivacuum dipoles are small and\n|e \uf02b | \uf02b |e \uf03f | \uf070 2e \uf02b \uf070 2e 0 , we get from 4.7a for variation of charge shift:\n2\n\uf041e \uf0b1 \uf03d e \uf02b \uf03f e \uf03f \uf03d 1 e 0 v2\n2 c\n\n4.10\n\nThe formula, unifying the internal and external group and phase velocities of\n\uf0bb\nasymmetric Bivacuum fermions (BVF as \uf0de, derived from (4.2) and (4.2a), is:\nv in\ngr\nc\n\n4\n\n\uf03d 1\uf03f\n\nv\nc\n\n2\n\n4.11\n\uf0bb\n\nwhere: \uf0ddv ext\ngr \uf0de \uf0af v is the external translational-rotational group velocity of BVF as .\nAt the conditions of \"Hidden Harmony\", meaning the equality of the internal and\n\uf0bb\nexternal rotational group and phase velocities of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions BVF as :\nrot\n\ntr\n\n4.12\n\nrot\n\ntr\n\n4.12a\n\next\n\uf0ddv in\ngr \uf0de V \uf02b \uf03d \uf0ddv gr \uf0de \uf0af v\next\n\uf0ddv in\nph \uf0de V \uf03f \uf03d \uf0ddv ph \uf0de\n\n\f29\nand introducing the notation:\nv in\ngr\nc\n\n2\n\nv\nc\n\n\uf03d\n\n2\n\n\uf03d\n\nv in\ngr\nv in\nph\n\n\uf03d\n\nv ext\ngr\nv ext\nph\n\n\uf0af\uf064\n\n4.13\n\nformula (4.11) turns to a simple quadratic equation:\n\uf064 2 \uf02b \uf064 \uf03f 1 \uf03d 0,\nwhich has a few modes :\nor :\n\n4.14\n\n\uf064 \uf03d 1 \uf03f 1 or :\n\uf064\n1\n\uf03d 1\n\uf064\n\uf0dd1 \uf03f \uf064\uf0de 1/2\n\n\uf064\n\uf03d1\n\uf0dd1 \uf03f \uf064\uf0de 1/2\n\n4.14a\n4.14b\n\nThe solution of (4.14), is equal to Golden mean: \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf03d \uf064 \uf03d 0. 618.

Our theory is the first one, elucidating these roots\n(Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000; 2005).

The recoil effects of paired \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 totally compensate each other and the\nrelativistic mass change of triplets is determined only by the anchor Bivacuum fermion\n\uf0ddBVF \uf0bb \uf0de anc of the unpaired sub-elementary fermion F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e.\n\nThe fusion of asymmetric sub-elementary fermions and antifermions of e, \uf057 and \uf062\n\uf064 e,\uf057,\uf062\n\uf0bb\ngenerations F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0af BVF as\n(Fig.2) to triplets results in corresponding\nelectrons/positrons, muons/antimuons and protons/antiprotons origination\n\n5.1\n\n\f33\ne,\uf057,p\n\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 x,y \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e z\n\n5.2\n\nThis fusion becomes possible at the Golden mean (GM) conditions, stimulated by the\nresonant exchange interaction with basic (q \uf03d 1) Bivacuum virtual pressure waves\n(VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de. In the case protons it is accompanied by the energy release and gluons\norigination, equal in sum to the mass defect, as far the mass of tauons is bigger, than the\nmass of the proton. In section 12.5 it will be proved, that stabilization of the\nelectron/positron triplets is possible without e-gluons exchange. The centrifugal force,\ngenerated by rotation of pair \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 ex,y can be compensated by the Coulomb attraction\nbetween F \uf02b\uf0b7 and F \uf03f\uf0b9 .\nSimilar consideration of muons with mass 0.106 GeV/c 2 (about 200 times bigger, than\n\uf057\nelectron's) reveals that the centrifugal force, generated by fast rotation of pair \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 x,y\naround common axis exceeds strongly the Coulomb attraction between sub-elementary\n\uf057\n\uf057\nfermions of corresponding lepton generation \uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de and \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de . This makes the triplet\nstructure of \uf057 \uf03felectron unstable even at Golden mean conditions. The experimental\nlife-time of muon is 2.19703\uf0d710 \uf03f6 s. The life-time of tauon with mass 1.7771 GeV/c 2 is\neven much shorter 2.95\uf0d710 \uf03f13 s. We suppose the reason of low stability of \uf062 \uf03felectron, is\nthat, in contrast to electron and muon, it represents just a monomeric form of asymmetric\n\uf064 \uf062\n\uf0bb\n. The fusion of these\nBivacuum fermion at GM conditions F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0af BVF as\nsub-elementary fermions to protons and neutrons stabilize the structure of these triplets.\nIt was demonstrated theoretically, that the vortical structures at certain conditions\nself-organizes into vortex crystals (Jin and Dubin, 2000).\nThe fusion of triplets is accompanied by 'switching on' the resonant exchange\ni\ninteraction of CVC \uf0b1q\uf03d1 with Bivacuum virtual pressure waves \uf0ddVPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de of fundamental\nfrequency (\uf067 0 \uf03d m 0 c 2 /\uf0a4\uf0de e,\uf057,\uf062 in the process of [corpuscle\uf0ddC\uf0de \uf0f0 wave\uf0ddW\uf0de] transitions of\nelementary particles. The triplets of elementary particles and antiparticles formation (Fig.2)\nis a result of fusion of third sub-elementary fermion (antifermion) \uf0dfF \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0e0 with one of\nsub-elementary fermion (antifermion) of rotating pair \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 of the opposite spins. The\nopposite spins means that their \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsations are counterphase and these two\nsub-elementary particles are spatially compatible (see section 9). The velocity of rotation of\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 around the same axis of common rotation axis of\npair (Fig.2) provide the similar mass and charge |e \uf0b1 |, as have the paired \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 and F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0\nbecause of similar symmetry shift.\nLet us analyze the rotational dynamics of unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,\uf057,\uf062 \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0 as in triplets\n(Fig.2) just after fusion to triplet at GM conditions in the absence of the external\ntranslational motion of triplet.\nIts properties are the result of participation in two rotational process simultaneously:\n1) rotation of asymmetric F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,\uf057,\uf062 around its own axis (Fig.2) with spatial image of\ntruncated cone with resulting radius:\n\uf064\n\nL BVF as \uf03d \uf0a4/|m \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV | \uf064 c \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0dfm 0 \uf0dd1/\uf064 \uf02b \uf064\uf0dec\uf0e0 \uf03d \uf0a4/2. 236m 0 c \uf03d L 0 /2. 23\n\n5.3\n\n2) rolling of this truncated cone of F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,\uf057,\uf062 around the another axis, common for pair of\nsub-elementary particles \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 (Fig.2) inside of a larger vorticity with bigger radius,\nequal to Compton radius:\n\uf064\n\nL BVF \uf0b7as \uf039 BVF as \uf0b9 \uf03d \uf0a4/|m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV | \uf064 c \uf03d \uf0a4/m 0 c \uf03d L 0\n\n5.4\n\n\f34\nwith Golden mean angular frequency:\nm i0 c 2\n\uf064\n\uf0dd\uf067 i\uf058,\uf0e6\uf058 \uf0de rot \uf03d c \uf03d \uf067 0 \uf03d\nL0\n\uf0a4\n\uf0bb\n\n5.4a\n\n\uf064\n\n\uf0af F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e to radius of pairs \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 at GM\nThe ratio of radius of BVF as\nconditions is equal to the ratio of potential energy (V) to kinetic energy (T k ) of relativistic\nde Broglie wave (wave B) at GM conditions.

In\ncontrast to charge, the spin of unpaired \uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de \uf062 is not compensated (totally) by spin of \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de e\nin neutrons, because of strong mass and angular momentum difference in conditions of the\n\uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de e confinement.\nAnother possible explanation of zero charge of the neutron is a such configuration of its\nthree sub-elementary fermions with structure,\n\uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 W \uf039 \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de C \uf0d7 n \uf0f0 \uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 C \uf039 \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de W \uf0d7 n\nproviding the recoilless C \uf0f0 W pulsation of all three sub-elementary fermions, like in\nM\u00f6ssbauer effect (see section 8.10).\nDifferent superpositions of three sub-elementary fermions, like different combinations\nof three interlocing Borromean rings (symbol, popular in Medieval Italy) can be\nresponsible for different properties of the electrons, protons and neutrons.\nThe mass of \uf062- electron, equal to that of \uf062-positron is: m \uf062 \uf0b1 \uf03d 1782\uf0dd3\uf0de MeV, the mass of\nthe regular electron is: m e \uf0b1 \uf03d 0, 511003\uf0dd1\uf0de MeV and the mass of \uf057 \uf03f electron is:\nm \uf057 \uf0b1 \uf03d 105, 6595\uf0dd2\uf0de MeV.\nFor the other hand, the mass of proton and neutron are correspondingly:\nm p \uf03d 938, 280\uf0dd3\uf0de MeV and m n \uf03d 939,573 (3) MeV. They are about two times less, than\nthe mass of \uf062- electron, equal, in accordance to our model, to mass of its unpaired\nsub-elementary fermion \uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de \uf062 . This difference characterize the energy of neutral massless\ngluons (exchange bosons), stabilizing the triplets of protons and neutrons. In the case of\nneutrons this difference is a bit less (taking into account the mass of \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0bb \uf0e0 e \uf0de, providing,\nhowever, much shorter life-time of isolated neutrons (918 sec.), than that of protons (\uf03e10 31\nyears).\nIn accordance to our hadrons models, each of three quarks (sub-elementary fermions of\n\uf062 \uf03f generation) in protons and neutrons can exist in 3 states (red, green and blue), but not\nsimultaneously:\n1. The red state of quark/antiquark means that it is in corpuscular [C] phase;\n2. The green state of quark/antiquark means that it is in wave [W] phase;\n3. The blue state means that quark/antiquark \uf0ddF \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0de \uf062 is in the transition [C]\uf0e9[W] state.\nThe 8 different combinations of the above defined states of 3 quarks of protons and\n\n5.11a\n\n\f36\nneutrons correspond to 8 gluons colors, stabilizing the these hadrons.

The rest mass of isolated sub-elementary\nfermion/antifermion before fusion of the electron or proton, is equal to the rest mass of\nunstable muon or tauon, correspondingly. The 200 times decrease of muons mass is a result\nof mass defect, equal to the binding energy of triplets: electrons or positrons. It is provided\nby origination of electronic e-gluons and release of the huge amount of excessive kinetic\n(thermal) energy, for example in form of high energy photons or e-neutrino beams.\nIn protons, as a result of fusion of three \uf062 \uf03felectrons/positrons, the contribution of\nhadron h-gluon energy to mass defect is only about 50% of their mass. However, the\nabsolute hadron fusion energy yield is higher, than that of the electrons and positrons.\nOur hypothesis of stable electron/positron and hadron fusion from short-living \uf057 and \uf062\n- electrons, as a precursor of electronic and hadronic quarks, correspondingly, can be\nverified using special collider.\nIn accordance to our Unified Theory, there are two different mechanisms of\nstabilization of the electron and proton structures in form of triplets of sub-elementary\nfermions/antifermions of the reduced \uf057 and \uf062 generations, correspondingly, preventing\nthem from exploding under the action of self-charge:\n1. Each of sub-elementary fermion/antifermion, representing asymmetric pair of torus\n(V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de, as a charge, magnetic and mass dipole, is stabilized by the\nCoulomb, magnetic and gravitational attraction between torus and antitorus;\n2. The stability of triplet, as a whole, is provided by the exchange of Cumulative Virtual\nClouds (CVC \uf02b and CVC \uf03f \uf0de between three sub-elementary fermions/antifermions in the\nprocess of their \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation. In the case of proton and neutron, the 8 transition\nstates corresponds to 8 h-gluons of hadrons, responsible for strong interaction. In the case\nof the electron or positron, the stabilization of triplets is realized by 8 lighter e-gluons.

It is resulted in modulation of positive and negative virtual pressure\nwaves [VPW \uf02b \uf039 VPW \uf03f \uf0e0 of Bivacuum, generating the Virtual Replica Multiplication of\nnucleons (see chapter 13). The feedback reaction between Bivacuum and elementary\nparticles is also existing.\n\n\f38\n5.2 Possible structure of mesons, W \uf0b1 and Z 0 bosons of electroweak interaction\nBy definition of Standard Model, the mesons are a family of subatomic particles (about\n140) that participate in strong interactions and have masses intermediate between leptons\nand baryons. When the mass of such particles, formed by quarks like baryons, exceeds the\nmass of baryons (proton, neutron, lambda and omega), they named bosonic hadrons. It is\ngenerally assumed, that they are composed of a quark and an antiquark. They are bosons\nwith spin, equal to zero or 1 and possible charge: 0, \uf02b1 and -1.\nIn our approach (see 5.15) the pairs of sub-elementary fermions of \uf062 or \uf057 generations\n\uf062,\uf057\n\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf062,\uf057\n\uf03d \uf0dfq \uf03f \uf02bq \uf02b \uf0e0 S\uf03d0,1 (see 5.6 - 5.9a), have a properties of mesons, as a neutral\nS\uf03d0,1\n[quark \uf02b antiquark] pair with bosonic integer spin. However these sub-elementary fermions\nare not symmetric necessarily, like \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf062,\uf057\nof triplets.

This means that the probability to find a particle with permanent p is equal in any\nspace volume (or it can be localized everywhere). This contradicts the experimental data.\nThe Quantum Mechanics solve this contradiction assuming the idea of Shr\u00f6dinger, that\nparticle represents the 'wave packet' with big number of de Broglie waves with different\np \uf03d \uf0a4k, localized in a small interval \uf041p. The amplitude of all this number of de Broglie\nwaves in the packet with spatial dimension \uf041x \uf03d \uf056 B add to each other because of close\nphase. For the other hand, at the \uf041x \uf03e\uf03e \uf056 B they damper out each other because of phase\ndifference.\nThe wave packet model can be explained, using our eq.7.4 for nonrelativistic particles:\nv \uf03c\uf03c c and R \uf03d 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 ~ 1. For this case, the carrying internal frequency of C \uf0ef W\npulsation (5.4c) is much higher, than the external translational de Broglie wave modulation\nfrequency (7.5): \uf067 in \uf03e\uf03e \uf067 ext\nB . The wave packet, consequently, in this case, is formed by the\nwaves, generated by the internal \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 in dynamics, corresponding to zitterbewegung\n(Shr\u00f6dinger, 1930). However, the wave packet concept itself do not explain the mechanism\nof C \uf0ef W duality.\nOur dynamic corpuscle - wave \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 duality theory suggests another possible\n\n7.11\n\n\f49\nexplanation of the uncertainty principle realization, as a counterphase pulsation of\nmomentum and position, energy and time, described above by eqs. 7.9 and 7.9a.

This structure determines the\nproperties of photon.\nUsually the photon originate, as a result of excitation and fusion of three pairs of\nasymmetric Bivacuum fermions and antifermions - one of secondary anchor site of photon\n(7.46), in the process of transition of the excited state of atom or molecule to the ground\nstate.\nThere are two possible ways to make the rotation of adjacent sub-elementary fermion\nand sub-elementary antifermion compatible. One of them is interaction 'side-by-side', like\nin the 1st and 3d pairs of (7.11a). In such a case of Cooper pairs, they are rotating in\nopposite directions and their angular momenta (spins) compensate each other, turning the\nresulting spin of such a pair to zero. The resulting energy and charge of such a pair of\nsub-elementary particle and antiparticle is also zero, because their symmetry shifts with\nrespect to Bivacuum is exactly opposite, compensating each other.\nThe other way of compatibility is interaction 'head-to-tail', like in a central pair of\nsub-elementary fermions of 7.11a. In this configuration they rotate in the same direction\nand the sum of their spins is: s \uf03d \uf0b11\uf0a4.

This stage is accompanied by excitation of\nelastic waves in Bivacuum matrix, representing reversible Bivacuum dipoles symmetry\nshifts, provided by the external translational momentum of uncompensated sub-elementary\nfermions in [C] phase. The stage I stands for kinetic energy and momentum transmission to\nbig number of secondary anchor sites of elementary particle in matrix, using Bivacuum\nnonlocal properties. At the same stage the wave [W] phase of symmetric pairs\n\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 simultaneously transfer the potential energy to the secondary anchor sites.\nThe properties and locations of the anchor sites corresponds to particle's eigenfunctions\nand corpuscular eigen states dependent on de Broglie wave length of the particle. The\nmechanism of the instant momentum and energy transmission, responsible for anchor sites\ncan be realized via bundles of Virtual Guides (see section 14).\nThe eigenfunctions, characterizing anchor sites are alternative, i.e. incompatible with\neach other - orthogonal. It means, that only one of many may be occupied by Cumulative\nVirtual Cloud (CVC \uf0b1 ) of particle in the process of its propagation throw Bivacuum (stage\nII).\nThe energy and charge conservation law demands, that in the absence of external fields,\nthe resulting energy of all activated anchor sites should be zero. It is possible, if we assume\nthat all secondary anchor sites (AS) are composed from two or three pairs of conjugated\nand correlated Cooper pairs of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions with energy, spin and\ncharge compensating each other:\nN\n\nAS \uf03d\n\n\uf03e 3\uf0dfBVF \uf0b7\uf0b1 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9\uf040 \uf0e0 n\n\nThe opposite asymmetry of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions, forming virtual\nCooper pairs, is provided by their rotation around common basic axis. Such anchor sites are\nproper for absorption of Cumulative Virtual Clouds (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de of the electrons, positrons and\nphotons in their [W] phase.\nStage II: Corresponds to particle state, when the unpaired/uncompensated\nsub-elementary fermions F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p or \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0bb \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0bb \uf0de S\uf03d\uf0b11 \uf03e ph are in expanded [W] phase,\nrepresenting cumulative virtual cloud (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de, modulated by de Broglie wave of particles,\ndetermined by properties of its primary anchor site. The symmetric pairs \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 on this\nstage II are in the compact [C] phase.\nThe jumps of the triplets (fermions) or sextet (photons) with group velocity of wave\npacket to one of prepared in previous stage I secondary anchor sites occur on this stage.\nThe properties of secondary anchor site can change after complex formation with particle,\nhowever without violation of energy conservation and energy dissipation.\nThe most probable distance of such 'jump' is determined by de Broglie wave length of\nparticle (\uf056 B \uf03d h/p\uf0de, equal to that of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC\uf0de of uncompensated\nsub-elementary fermions and the most probable direction of jump coincide with particle\nmomentum in its [C] phase. However the new location of particle, as only one of many\n\n7.46\n\n\f60\npossible, is not rigidly predetermined and the 'jumps' can be considered as the stochastic\nprocess. The described mechanism of elementary particles propagation in space can be\nnamed \"the kangaroo effect\".\nThe principle of superposition in quantum mechanics has the same formal expression as\nthe waves superposition in classical mechanics:\n\uf0ae\uf0ddr, t\uf0de \uf03d c 1 \uf0ae\uf0ddr, t\uf0de 1 \uf02b c 2 \uf0ae\uf0ddr, t\uf0de 2 \uf02b. . . . c n \uf0ae\uf0ddr, t\uf0de n\n\n7.47\n\nwhere: c n are arbitrary complex numbers; \uf0ae\uf0ddr, t\uf0de n is wave function, describing different\nand alternative/orthogonal \uf0ddn\uf0de states of quantum system. In accordance to our theory these\nquantum states correspond to multiple secondary anchor sites of moving in space particle.\nHowever, in contrast to state/wave superposition of classical systems, in quantum\nsystem any state is not the result of 'mixing' of other states, but always the alternative or\northogonal, i.e. only one state of many allowed can be realized. It is so-called collapsing of\nthe wave function.\nOur description of the 'anchor' sites is in accordance with interpretation of wave\nfunction as a cohomological measure of quantum vorticity by Kiehn (1989, 1998). An exact\ncomplex mapping of the wave function has been found, which, when followed by a\nseparation into real and imaginary parts, transforms the two dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for a charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic field into two partial\ndifferential systems. The first partial differential system is exactly the evolutionary\nequation for the vorticity of a compressible, viscous two dimensional Navie-Stokes fluid.\nThe second system is related to the Beltrami equation defining a minimal surface in terms\nof the kinetic and potential energy. The absolute square of the wave function is exactly the\nvorticity distribution in a fluid. This distribution corresponds to distribution of secondary\nanchor sites in our model of particle propagation (7.46 and 7.47). This interpretation of the\nwave function offers an alternative to the Copenhagen dogma.\n8.

It is accompanied by oscillation of the instant de Broglie wave length\n(\uf056 tB \uf0de.\n\uf0bb\nThe acceleration of charge in the process of C \uf0ef W pulsation of the anchor BVF anc can\nbe expressed as:\na \uf03d \uf067 2B \uf041\uf056 B \uf0ddt\uf0de\n\n8.3\n\na \uf03d \uf067 2B \uf0dd\uf056 tB \uf03f\uf056 0 \uf0de sin \uf067 B t\n\n8.4\n\nwhere: \uf056 tB \uf03d 2\uf05eL tB is the instant de Broglie wave length of the particle and \uf056 0 \uf03d h/m 0 c is\nthe Compton length of triplet.\n\uf0bb\nThe intensity of dipole radiation of pulsing BVF anc from 8.2 and 8.4 is:\n\uf050 EM \uf03d\n\n2 \uf067 4 \uf0ddd t \uf0de 2\nE\nB\n3c 3\n\nwhere the oscillating electric dipole moment is: d tE \uf03d e\uf0dd\uf056 tB \uf03f\uf056 0 \uf0de.\nConsequently, in accordance with our model of duality, the EM dipole radiation is due\nto modulation of the frequency of C \uf0f0 W pulsation of three sub-elementary fermions of\n\uf0bb\nthe electron or proton by \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 anc frequency of anchor Bivacuum fermions BVF anc ,\nrelated to thermal vibrations of elementary particles. These vibrations are are accompanied\nby creation of secondary anchor sites (AS), described in previous section (eq.7.46). When\nthe accelerations and final kinetic energy of elementary charges are big enough for resonant\ninteraction with basic Bivacuum virtual pressure waves [VPW \uf02b \uf039 VPW \uf03f \uf0e0 q\uf03d1 , the AS from\nvirtual excitations transform to photons (Fig.4 of this paper).\nThe electromagnetic field, is a result of correlated Corpuscle - Wave pulsation of group\nof such transformed photons and their fast rotation in opposite directions with angle\nvelocity (\uf067 rot ), equal to \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation frequency of sub-elementary fermions and\nantifermions, forming photons. The superposition of clockwise or anticlockwise direction\nof photon's rotation as respect to direction of their propagation, determines their\npolarization.\n8.2 Different kind of Bivacuum dipoles symmetry perturbation\nby dynamics of elementary particles, as a background of fields origination\nIn the process of [C \uf0ef W] pulsation of sub-elementary particles in triplets\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p the reversibility of [local (internal) \uf0f9 distant (external)]\nsymmetry compensation effects stand for the energy conservation law. The local symmetry\neffects pertinent for the [C] phase of particles. They are confined in the volume of\nsub-elementary fermions and stabilized by the Coulomb, magnetic and gravitational\nattraction between opposite charges and mass of asymmetric torus and antitorus of sub elementary fermions. The attraction forces between two sub-elementary fermions in pairs\n\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 are balanced by centrifugal force of their axial rotation around common axes.\nThe axis of triplet rotation is strictly related, in accordance to our model, with its spin and\ndirection of translational propagation. It is supposed, that like magnetic field force lines,\nthis rotation follows the right hand screw rule and is responsible for magnetic field\norigination. The total energy of triplet, the angular frequency of its rotation and the velocity\nof its translational propagation in space are interrelated (see eqs. 6.8 and 6.8b).\nThe [C \uf0b8 W\uf0e0 transitions of unpaired/uncompensated F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p of elementary particles\nare accompanied by the diverging effects - translational and rotational (angular),\naccompanied by distant elastic deformation of Bivacuum matrix, shifting the corresponding\nsymmetry (charge and spin equilibrium) of Bivacuum dipoles.\n\n8.5\n\n\f62\nThe reverse \uf0dfW \uf0b8 C\uf0e0 transition represents the converging effect. The latter is\naccompanied by getting back the energy, diverged in previous phase and restoration of the\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion and the whole triplet local/enfolded asymmetric\nproperties.\nThe \uf0dfdivergence \uf0f0 convergence\uf0e0 of mass/energy, charge and spin equilibrium shifts in\nsurrounding medium of Bivacuum dipoles (BVF \uf0b7 and BVF \uf0b9 \uf0de in form of spherical elastic\nwaves, are induced by \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsations of triplets and accompanied recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil\neffects. These effects are generated by unpaired positive sub-elementary fermion F \uf02b\uf0bb \uf03e of\ntriplets \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p . They are opposite for particles and antiparticles.\nCorresponding charge symmetry shifts between torus and antitorus of Bivacuum dipoles\nare dependent on distance \uf0ddR\uf0de from pulsing triplets, as ( r /R). The induced by such\nmechanism attraction and assembly of Bivacuum dipoles can be accompanied by formation\nof Cooper pairs \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7\uf02b \uf039 BVF \uf0b9\uf03f \uf0e0 in space between remote F \uf02b\uf0bb \uf03e and F \uf03f\uf0bb \uf03e of different\ntriplets. The attraction between elementary particles of opposite charges is a result of\nBivacuum tendency to minimize the uncompensated symmetry shift and charge density by\n\uf0bb\nformation of Cooper pairs from BVF \uf0b1 . This compensation effect is increasing with with\ndecreasing the separation between charges \uf0ddR \uf0b8 0\uf0de. The corresponding ordering of Cooper\npairs, like bundles of virtual microfilaments stands for electrostatic field and its 'force lines\norigination. The Coulomb repulsion between similar charges is consequence of decreasing\nthe resulting Bivacuum asymmetry of the same sign (positive or negative) in space between\nthem by increasing the separation between these charges \uf0ddR \uf0b8 \uf04b\uf0de.\nThe electrostatic field tension, produced by charged particles, is proportional to their\nF \uf0b1 \uf03e e,p\nkinetic energy (\uf04aT k \uf0bb ). It can be expressed via gradients of charge symmetry shift of\nBivacuum dipoles of surrounding medium, interrelated also mass symmetry shift and the\nexternal kinetic energy of dipoles:\nF \uf0b1 \uf03e e,p\n\nE E \uf03d \uf03fgrad |e \uf02b \uf03f e \uf03f | BVF \uf03d \uf03fgrad |m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV |c 2BVF ~ \uf04aT k \uf0bb\nF \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p\n\n\uf04aT k\n\n8.5a\n\n\uf03d \uf04a 1 |m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV |c 2 \uf03d \uf04a 1 m \uf02bV v 2\n2\n2\n\nwhere: \uf04a \uf03d e 2 /\uf0a4c is electromagnetic fine structure constant.\nThe validity of 8.5a will be presented in the next section.\nThe direction of fast rotation of pairs of sub-elementary fermion and antifermion\n\uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 of triplets \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e e,p of opposite charges - clockwise or\nanticlockwise and unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e is dependent on direction of triplets propagation. The\nrotational motion is pertinent for [C] phase of \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 and is absent for their [W] phase.\nConsequently, their \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation, counterphase to pulsation of F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e should induce\nthe oscillation of spin equilibrium shift between Bivacuum fermions and antifermions of\nclockwise and anticlockwise rotation \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf0ef BVB \uf0b1 \uf0f0 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 to the left or right. The sign\nof shift is dependent on direction of triplets propagation.\nThe shift of spin equilibrium in Bivacuum is accompanied by disassembly of Cooper\npairs:\n\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7\n\nn \uf0bb \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf0b8 n \uf0b7 BVF \uf0b7 \uf02b n \uf0b9 BVF \uf0b9\nIn the absence of magnetic field the densities of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions\nare equal to each other n \uf0bb \uf03d n \uf0b7 \uf03d n \uf0b9 and all of them compensate each other spins.\nLet's assume, that the increasing of BVF \uf0b7 density (n \uf0b7 \uf0de and corresponding decreasing of\nBVF \uf0b9 density (n \uf0b9 \uf0de corresponds to the North (N) magnetic pole formation. The opposite to\n\n8.5a\n\n\f63\nthat, Bivacuum dipoles densities shifts stands for South (S) pole formation, i.e. when n \uf0b9 is\nincreasing and n \uf0b7 decreasing:\nN pole:\n\nn\uf0b7 \uf03e n\uf0b9\n\nS pole:\n\nn\uf0b9 \uf03e n\uf0b7\n\n8.5b\n\nThe attraction between opposite poles N and S reflects the tendency of BVF \uf0b7 and BVF \uf0b9\nof the excessive density to form stable Cooper pairs, equalizing the symmetry shift between\ndensities of Bivacuum dipoles of opposite spins:\nattraction: \uf0ddn \uf0b7 BVF \uf0b7 \uf0de N \uf039 \uf0ddn \uf0b9 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0de S\nFor the other hand, the repulsion between similar magnetic poles is a consequence of\nPauli principle of spatial incompatibility of two fermions (real or virtual) of the same spins\n(see section 9):\nrepulsion: \uf0ddn \uf0b7 BVF \uf0b7 \uf0de N \uf0e9 \uf0ddn \uf0b7 BVF \uf0b7 \uf0de N\n\n8.5c\n\nrepulsion: \uf0ddn \uf0b9 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0de S \uf0e9 \uf0ddn \uf0b9 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0de S\nThe magnetic attraction and repulsion between Bivacuum dipoles is most effective,\nwhen n \uf0b7 \uf070 n \uf0b9 and is increasing with their densities.\nConsequently, just the equilibrium shift between Bivacuum fermions and antifermions\nof opposite spins, depending on direction of current and rotation of triplets, stands for the\npole and intensity of curled magnetic field origination around current.\nThe thermal motion of conducting electrons in metals or ions in plasma became more\nordered in electric current, increasing correspondingly the magnetic cumulative effects due\nto increasing of probability and number of triplets, rotating in the same plane and direction.\nThe bigger is velocity and kinetic energy of triplets, the faster is their rotation and bigger\nmagnetic field tension, excited by this rotation:\nF \uf0b1 \uf03e e,p\n\nH \uf03d grad \uf0ddK BVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0BVF \uf0b9 \uf0de \uf03d \uf0dd r /R\uf0deK BVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0BVF \uf0b9 ~ \uf04aT k \uf0bb\nF \uf0b1 \uf03e e,p\n\uf04aT k \uf0bb\n\n2\n\uf03d \uf04a 1 |m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV |c 2 \uf03d \uf04a 1 m \uf02bV v 2 \uf03d \uf04a 1 m \uf02bV \uf067 2T L T\n2\n2\n2\n\nThe pulsation of potential energy of sub-elementary fermions, in contrast to that of\nkinetic one, is determined by the sum of absolute energies of their torus and antitorus:\nV \uf03d 12 \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 . Consequently, the amplitude of this kind of energy pulsation is\nindependent on the charge of fermion.\nThe potential energy oscillation of each of paired sub-elementary fermions \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0\nof triplets have similar but opposite effect on excitation of (V \uf02b \uf0de and (V \uf03f \uf0de of surrounding\nBVF \uf0bb \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0, equal to unpaired one by absolute value.\nThe excitation of positive and negative virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf02bq and VPW \uf03fq \uf0de by\nthe recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil effects, accompanied the \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of potential energy of\nsub-elementary fermions of elementary particles is a background of gravitational field in\naccordance to our theory, independently on charge. The influence of the in-phase\nrecoil/antirecoil effects of pulsing \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 on the probability of excitation of positive\nand negative virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf02b and VPW \uf03f \uf0de in Bivacuum by torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and\nantitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of Bivacuum dipoles BVF \uf0bb \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0 is equal by absolute value to\nincrement. It is determined by corresponding potential energy oscillation of unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e\nof triplets.\n\n8.5d\n\n\f64\nIt is possible to present the given above explanation of the Coulomb, magnetic and\ngravitational fields nature in more formal way. The total energies of [C \uf0b8 W] and\n[W \uf0b8 C] transitions of particles we present using general formula (6.1): E tot \uf03d V tot \uf02b T tot .\nHowever, here we take into account the diverging \uf0ef converging effects, accompanied\n[C \uf0f0 W] transitions and reversible transformation of the internal - local (Loc)\ngravitational, Coulomb and magnetic potentials to the external - distant (Dis) Bivacuum\nperturbation, stimulated by these transitions. For the end of energy conservation it is\nassumed, that the local and distant energy increments are opposite by sign and compensate\neach other. The distant diverging \uf0ef converging effects, in contrast to local\nemission \uf0f0 absorption of CVC \uf0b1 , can be described in terms of recoil (Rec) \uf0f0 antirecoil\n(ARec) effects.\nThe [C \uf0b8 W] transition, accompanied by three kinds of diverging effects, can be\ndescribed as:\nDist\nE C\uf0b8W \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d V tot \uf02b \uf0df\uf0ddE G \uf0de Loc\nRe c \uf03f \uf0ddE G \uf0de Re c \uf0e0 \uf02b\n\n8.6\n\nDist\n\uf02b T tot \uf02b \uf0df\uf0ddE E \uf0de Loc\nRe c \uf03f \uf0ddE E \uf0de Re c \uf0e0 tr \uf02b\n\n8.6a\n\nDist\n\uf02b \uf0df\uf0ddE H \uf0de Loc\nRe c \uf03f \uf0ddE H \uf0de Re c \uf0e0 rot\n\n8.6b\n\nIn the process of the reverse [W \uf0b8 C] converging transition the unpaired\nsub-elementary fermion F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e of triplet \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb S\uf03d\uf0b11/2 \uf03e gets back the\ndiverged in previous phase antirecoil energy due to elastic properties of Bivacuum, turning\nits symmetry shift from the distant to local one of opposite energy:\nDist\nE W\uf0b8C \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d V tot \uf02b \uf0df\uf03f\uf0ddE G \uf0de Loc\nA Re c \uf02b \uf0ddE G \uf0de A Re c \uf0e0 \uf02b\n\n\uf02b T tot \uf02b\n\n\uf0df\uf03f\uf0ddE E \uf0de Loc\nA Re c\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf0ddE E \uf0de Dist\nA Re c \uf0e0 tr\n\n\uf02b\n\nDist\n\uf02b \uf0df\uf03f\uf0ddE H \uf0de Loc\nA Re c \uf02b \uf0ddE H \uf0de A Re c \uf0e0 rot \uf02b\n\n8.7\n8.7a\n8.7b\n\nwhere:\n1 \uf0ddm \uf02b \uf02b m \uf03f \uf0dec 2 \uf03d V C \uf03d 1 m \uf02b c 2 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nVW\ntot \uf03d\nV\nV\ntot\n2\n2 V\nis a total potential energy of each sub-elementary fermion of triplet (6.4) in the wave and\ncorpuscular phase, non equal to zero at v \uf03d 0;\n1 \uf0ddm \uf02b \uf03f m \uf03f \uf0dec 2 \uf03d T C \uf03d 1 m \uf02b v 2\nTW\ntot \uf03d\nV\nV\ntot\n2\n2 V\nis its total kinetic energy, equal to zero at the external velocity v ext \uf03d 0 (6.5).\nThe reversible conversions of the localized potential energy \uf0b1\uf0ddV G \uf0de Loc\nto the\nRe c, A Re c\nDist\ndistant one \uf040\uf0ddV G \uf0de Re c,A Re c , accompanied the recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil effects, induced by\n[C \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation of unpaired sub-elementary fermion of triplets at v ext \uf03d 0, i.e. when its\nmass symmetry shift is equal to the rest mass, can be evaluated quantitatively.

This phenomena can be responsible for the attraction effect of 'cold dark\nmatter' of the Universe.

The bigger is quantum\nnumber of Bivacuum dipoles excitation (n), the higher is frequency of virtual pressure\nwaves \uf0dfVPW \uf02bq \uf039 VPW \uf03fq \uf0e0 G , responsible for gravitational field.\nFrom the proposed here mechanism of gravitation and similar values of \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de in the left\nand right parts of eq. (8.10) follows the equality of gravitational and inertial mass. The\ninertia itself can be defined, as a resistance to additional symmetry shift between the actual\nand complementary masses/energy of sub-elementary fermions (m \uf02bV and m \uf03fV \uf0de of\nelementary particles and surrounding Bivacuum dipoles, accompanied positive and\nnegative particles acceleration. Consequently, the inertia follows from generalized Le\nChatelier's Principle, which this author formulate, as a resistance of any system, containing\nsub-elementary fermions of elementary particles in state of dynamic equilibrium, to\nadditional symmetry shift, accompanied particles acceleration.\n8.4 The hydrodynamic mechanism of gravitational attraction and repulsion\nIn accordance to our hypothesis (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000; 2005), the mechanism of\ngravitational attraction and repulsion is similar to Bjerknes attraction/repulsion between\npulsing spheres in liquid medium of Bivacuum. The dependence of Bjerknes force on\ndistance between centers of pulsing objects is quadratic: F Bj ~ 1/r 2 :\nF G \uf03d F Bj \uf03d 12 \uf05e\uf05f G R 21 R 22 v 2 cos \uf04b\nr\n\n8.12\n\nwhere \uf05f G is density of liquid, i.e. virtual density of secondary Bivacuum. It is\ndetermined by Bivacuum dipoles (BVF \uf0bb and BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de symmetry shift; R 1 and R 2 radiuses of\npulsing/gravitating spheres; v is velocity of spheres surface oscillation (i.e. velocity of\nVPW \uf0b1q , excited by \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of elementary particles, which can be assumed to be\nequal to light velocity: v \uf03d c); \uf04b is a phase shift between pulsation of spheres or system of\ncoherent elementary particles.\nIt is important to note, that on the big enough distances the attraction may turn to\nrepulsion. The latter effect, depending on the phase shift of coherent \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of\ninteracting remote triplets (\uf04b\uf0de, can explain the revealed acceleration of the Universe\nexpansion. The corresponding antigravitation energy or negative pressure energy (dark\nenergy), is about 70% of the total Universe energy.\nThe possibility of artificial phase shift of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of coherent elementary\nparticles of any object may (for example by magnetic field) may change its gravitational\nattraction to repulsion and vice versa. The volume and radius of pulsing spheres (R 1 and\nR 2 \uf0de in such approach is determined by sum of volume of hadrons, composing gravitating\nsystems in solid, liquid, gas or plasma state. The gravitational attraction or repulsion is a\nresult of increasing or decreasing of virtual pressure of subquantum particles between\ninteracting systems as respect to its value outside them. This model can serve as a\nbackground for new quantum gravity theory.\nThe effective radiuses of gravitating objects R 1 and R 2 can be calculated from the\neffective volumes of the objects:\nV 1,2 \uf03d 4 \uf05eR 31,2 \uf03d N 1,2 4 \uf05eL 3p,n\n3\n3\nwhere: N 1,2 \uf03d M 1,2 /m p,n is the number of protons and neutrons in gravitating bodies\nwith mass M 1 and M 2 ; m p,n is the mass of proton and neutron; L p,n \uf03d \uf0a4/m p,n c is the\nCompton radius of proton and neutron.\nFrom (8.12a) we get for effective radiuses:\n\n8.12a\n\n\f69\n\n1/3\n\nM 1,2\nm p,n\n\nR 1,2 \uf03d\n\n1/3\n\nM 1,2\nm p,n\n\nL p,n \uf03d\n\n\uf0a4\nm p,n c\n\n8.12b\n\nPutting this to (8.12) we get for gravitational interaction between two macroscopic\nobjects, each of them formed by atoms with coherently pulsing protons and neutrons:\n\uf0ddM 1 M 2 \uf0de 2/3\nF G \uf03d 12 \uf05e\uf05f Bv\nr\nm 4/3\np,n\nEqualizing this formula with Newton's one: F NG \uf03d\nfor gravitational constant:\nG\uf03d\uf05e\n\n\uf05fG\n3\n\n\uf0a4\nm p,n\n1\nr2\n\n4\n\n1\nc2\n\n8.13\n\nG\uf0ddM 1 M 2 \uf0de, we get the expression\n\n\uf0a4 2 /c 2\n16\n3 m p,n\n\nM1M2\n\n8.14\n\nThe condition of gravitational constant permanency from (8.14), is the anticipated from\nour theory interrelation between the mass of gravitating bodies 3 M 1 M 2 and the virtual\ndensity \uf05f G of secondary Bivacuum, determined by Bivacuum fermions symmetry shift and\nexcitation in gravitational field:\nG \uf03d const,\n\n\uf05fG\n\nif\n3\n\nM1M2\n\n\uf03d const\n\n8.14a\n\nwhere, taking into account (8.10):\n3\n\nM1M2 ~ \uf05fG \uf03d\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\nm0\nM Pl\n3\n4\n\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0de\n\n\uf05eL 3V\n\n\uf03d2\n3\n\nm0\nM Pl\n\n2\n\nm \uf02bV \uf0dd2 \uf03f v 2 /c 2 \uf0de\n\uf05eL 3V\n\n8.15\n\nassuming, that the radius/curvature of Bivacuum fermion, characterizing it s potential\nenergy, is:\nLV \uf03d\n\n\uf0a4\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec\n\n8.16\n\nwe get for reduced gravitational density:\n\uf05fG \uf03d 2 1 3\n3 \uf05e\uf0a4\n\nm0\nM Pl\n\n2\n\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0de 4 c 3\n\nwe may see from (8.16) that the bigger is potential energy of Bivacuum:\nV \uf03d 12 \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 the bigger is gravitational density and corresponding interaction.\n8.5 Possible nature of neutrino and antineutrino\nFollowing from our approach to elementary particles formation (chapter 5), the neutrino\n(antineutrino) of three lepton generation \uf0ddi \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de can be considered, as a stable neutral\nfermion, formed by pair of asymmetric charged Bivacuum fermion (antifermion) and\nasymmetric Bivacuum antiboson (boson) of zero spin and opposite energy and charge\n(BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de i \uf0af \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0b7\uf0b9 V \uf03f \uf0e0, compensating that of\ni\n\uf02b\nBVF S\uf03d1/2\n\uf0af \uf0dfV \uf0b7\uf0b7 V \uf03f \uf0e0 or BVF S\uf03d\uf03f1/2\n\uf0af \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0b9\uf0b9 V \uf03f \uf0e0 :\n\uf03f\n\uf02b\n\n8.16a\n\n\f70\n\uf0b1\n\n\uf0dd\uf058\uf0de i ~\uf0dfBVF \uf0b7\uf040 \uf0e9BVB \uf0e0 i\n\n8.16b\n\n\uf0b9\n\uf0de i ~\uf0dfBVF \uf040 \uf0e9BVB \uf0b1 \uf0e0 i\n\n8.16c\n\n\uf0dd\uf058\n\nThese two Bivacuum dipoles are rotating as respect to each other 'side-by-side'\nprinciple.\nTheir relativistic mass/energy and charge symmetry shifts are close to Golden mean\nconditions:\n|m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV | iBVF \uf0b7\uf040 c 2 \uf072 m i0 c 2\n\n8.17\n\n|m \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV | iBVB \uf0b1 c 2 \uf072 m i0 c 2\n\n8.17a\n\nThis asymmetric pair is rotating around main common axes with Golden Mean angular\nfrequency and tangential velocity squared: v 2 \uf03d \uf064c 2 , providing corresponding symmetry\n\uf0e9 BVB \uf0b1 \uf0e0 i pairs (eq.5.4a):\nshift and frequency of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of each of \uf0dfBVF S\uf03d\uf0b11/2\n\uf040\nm i0 c 2\n\uf064\n\uf03d \uf067 iC\uf0f0W\n\uf0dd\uf067 i\uf058,\uf0e6\uf058 \uf0de rot \uf03d c \uf03d \uf067 0 \uf03d\nL0\n\uf0a4\n\n8.18\n\nThe rotating Cooper pairs (neutrinos) propagate in direction parallel to rotation axis,\nwith light velocity or very close to that, like the photons, because of their quasi-ideal\nsymmetry as respect to Bivacuum.

Good description of\nneutrino properties could be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino.\nIt is important to mention, that in accordance of our formula for total energy of\nrelativistic particle (7.4) at v \uf070 c, the relativistic factor R \uf03d 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf070 0, its total\nenergy is determined by its kinetic energy.

For example, the solution of the solar neutrino problem, as a major\ndiscrepancy between measurements of the neutrinos flowing through the Earth and\ntheoretical models of the solar interior needs the neutrino oscillation. The probability of\nmeasuring a particular flavor for a neutrino varies periodically as it propagates. In\naccordance to our model of neutrino these interconversions can be a result of simultaneous\n\uf0b1\nreversible excitation of pair \uf0dd\uf058\uf0de i ~\uf0dfBVF \uf0b7\uf040 \uf0e9 BVB \uf0e0 e from it ground state with minimum\nenergy of torus and antitorus to their certain excited states, corresponding to muon and tau\n\uf0b1\n\uf0b7\nneutrinos \uf0dfBVF \uf040 \uf0e9 BVB \uf0e0 \uf057,\uf062 . Consequently, the neutrino oscillation between different\ngenerations can be a result of absorbtion or emission by one type of neutrino the high\nfrequency pair of standing Bivacuum virtual pressure waves (8.18a) of corresponding\ngeneration \uf0dfVPW \uf02b \uf039 VPW \uf03f \uf0e0 \uf057,\uf062\nq\uf03e\uf03e1 .

The additivity of different forms of energy means the additivity of\nBivacuum dipoles torus and antitorus energy difference (i.e. forms of kinetic energy) and\nsum of their absolute values (forms of potential energy). These energy conservation\nquantum roots are illustrated for one sub-elementary particle case by eqs.(6.1 and 6.1a).\nThe reversible conversion of the localized asymmetry of sub-elementary fermions of\nelementary particles to spatially delocalized asymmetry in huge number of Bivacuum\ndipoles around these particles in the process of their \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation, is a general\n\n8.19c\n\n\f72\nphenomena. This idea of dynamic equilibrium between diverging energy, charge and\nangular momentum (spin) in the process of C \uf0b8 W transition, responsible for fields\norigination, and converging process of matter formation: W \uf0b8 C, can be formulated as\nfollows:\nThe total sum of local (corpuscular) and non-local (wave/field) kinetic and potential energies,\nresponsible for Matter and Bivacuum interconversions and interaction is zero:\n1\nZ\n\n\uf02b\n\uf04b\n\n\uf04b\n\n\uf03f\n\n\uf03f\n\nW\n\n\uf03e P k c 2 \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m V \uf0de \uf02b \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m V \uf0de\n1\nZ\n\n\uf04b\n\n\uf03e\n\nP j \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV v 2 \uf0de\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf041m \uf02bV c 2 \uf0dd2\n\n\uf03f\n\nv2\nc2\n\n\uf0de\n\nk\nC\n\n\uf03d 0\n\n8.20\n\nj\n\n\uf04b\n\nwhere: Z \uf03d \uf03e P k \uf02b \uf03e P j is the total partition function, i.e. sum of probabilities of all\npossible transitions of energy in the Universe, including interconversions of fields and\nmatter.\nIn the process of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation we have following transitions of kinetic energy:\n\uf03f\n\n\uf041T k \uf03d \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m V \uf0dec 2 \uf0f0 \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV v 2 \uf0de\n\n8.20a\n\nand following transitions of potential energy:\n2\n\uf03f\n\uf041V \uf03d \uf041\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m V \uf0dec 2 \uf0f0 \uf041m \uf02bV c 2 \uf0dd2 \uf03f v2 \uf0de j\nc\n\nm \uf02bV and m \uf03fV are the actual and complementary mass of torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of\neach Bivacuum dipoles and elementary particle in the Universe.\nSuch matter - fields energy interconversions in the Universe, as consequence of\nproposed in this work duality mechanism, can be considered, as a background for the\nenergy conservation law.\n8.7 The mechanism of electrostatic and magnetic field origination\nIt is demonstrated, that the charge symmetry and spin equilibrium shift oscillation in\nBivacuum matrix in form of spherical elastic waves, provide the electric and magnetic\nfields origination. These excitations are the consequence of reversible\ndiverging \uf0f0 converging of Cumulative Virtual Clouds (CVC \uf0b1 \uf0de, accompanied the\n\uf0dfCorpuscle \uf0ef Wave\uf0e0 pulsation of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions of triplets and\ntheir fast rotation. The tendency of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions and antifermions of\nopposite spins and charge shifts to formation of Cooper pairs [BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 is\nresponsible for Coulomb attraction and the Pauli and electric repulsion between Bivacuum\ndipoles of similar spins and charge shift stands for Coulomb repulsion. Consequently, the\nelectric field formation is a result of internal shift of charge equilibrium in each Bivacuum\ndipole.\nThe magnetic field and N or S poles origination is a result of shift of equilibrium\n[BVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0 BVB \uf0b1 \uf0f0 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 to the left or right, correspondingly, depending on clockwise or\nanticlockwise rotation of triplets, correlated with direction of their propagation and charge.\nThe magnetic poles attraction or repulsion is also dependent on possibility of Cooper pairs\nof Bivacuum dipoles assembly or disassembly. However, this process is independent on\ninternal symmetry shifts of Bivacuum dipoles, responsible for electric field.\n\n8.20b\n\n\f73\nLet us consider the origination of electrostatic and magnetic field in more formalized\nway.

The opposite or similar Bivacuum dipoles charge symmetry shifts, providing their\n\n\f74\nattraction or repulsion, correspondingly;\n2. Assembly or disassembly of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions of opposite or\nsimilar charge symmetry shifts, correspondingly;\n3.

The asymmetry of torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de of\nBivacuum dipoles means their ability to beats, accompanied by emission\uf0f0absorption of\nVirtual Clouds (VC \uf0b1 \uf0de of the opposite or similar energy. The attraction between opposite\ncharges is a consequence of exchange interaction between Bivacuum fermions (BVF \uf0b1 \uf0de\nwith opposite by sign \uf0dfVC \uf02b \uf02b VC \uf03f \uf0e0, following by decreasing of the resulting symmetry\nshift of Bivacuum. The less is separation between real charged particles, the more is\nsymmetry shift of BVF \uf0b1 in space between them and more effective is the exchange\ninteraction, stimulating the attraction between opposite charges. The attraction decreases\nwith distance between charges (R) as (r/R), where r is radius vector between charges.\nThe repulsion between similar charges is also due to superposition of VC \uf0b1 of similar\nsign decreases with distance increasing between charges. Both of these processes are the\nconsequence of energy conservation law, formulated as eq. 8.20, involving tendency of the\nBivacuum symmetry increments to zero.\nThe 2nd factor - the assembly of Bivacuum dipoles of opposite charge is a consequence\nof the 1st one as a result of exchange of VC \uf0b1 between BVF \uf02b and BVF \uf03f of opposite charge\nand their assembly in virtual Cooper pairs:\n\uf0b7\n\nBVF \uf02b \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0ec V \uf03f \uf0e0 S\uf03d\uf02b1/2\n\n\uf02b \uf0ddBVF \uf0b9\uf03f \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0ee V \uf03f \uf0e0 S\uf03d\uf03f1/2 \uf0de\n\ninduced by the unpaired sub-elementary fermions of triplets of opposite charge. The\nflip-flop spin exchange also is possible in these Cooper pairs.\nThe linear polymerization of such pairs by \"head to tail\" principle is possible in space\nbetween F \uf0b1\uf0bb S\uf03d\uf0b11/2 \uf03e of triplets of opposite charges, like. electron and positron.\n\uf0b7\nSuch virtual microtubules, composed from Cooper pairs \uf03e\uf0ddBVF \uf02b \uf02b \uf0ddBVF \uf0b9\uf03f \uf0de are\nresponsible for the 'force lines' origination between the opposite distant charges.\nIn space between similar charge the probability of virtual Cooper pairs (8.25)\ndisassembly increases due to repulsion between similar charges of Bivacuum fermions of\nthe same charge symmetry shift. This effect also decreases with distance (R) between\ncharges as (r/R), where r is unitary radius vector.\nThe 3d factor is determined by interaction of positive and negative subquantum\n\uf03f\nparticles density oscillation, representing virtual pressure waves: VPW \uf02b and VPW is\ndirectly interrelated with 2nd one. Its effect on attraction or repulsion of charges also can\nbe explained in terms of tending of system: Charges \uf02b Bivacuum to minimum symmetry\nshift and energy density in space between charges in accordance to energy conservation\nlaw in form of eq. 8.20.\n\n8.25\n\n\f75\n8.9 The magnetic field origination\nThe oscillation of magnetic dipole radiation contribution in the process of [C \uf0ef W\uf0e0\npulsations of sub-elementary fermions between local and distant modes do not\naccompanied by magnetic moments symmetry change, but only by the oscillation of\nseparation between torus and antitorus of BVF \uf0bb : L T \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec and rotational\nenergy of CVC \uf0b1 \uf0dfemitted \uf0f0 absorbed\uf0e0 in the process of [C \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation.\nIt can be described as:\nK iH\nor :\n\nLoc\n\n|\uf057 \uf02b \uf057 \uf03f |\nLT\n\nK iH\n\nC\uf0b8W\n\nK iH\n\n\uf0e8\n\n\uf0dfC\uf0e0\n\nW\uf0b8C\nLoc\n\n|\uf057 \uf02b \uf057 \uf03f |\nLT\n\nC\uf0b8W\n\nK iH\n\n\uf0e8\n\n\uf0dfC\uf0e0\n\n\uf057 20\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2\n\uf0a4c\n\nW\uf0b8C\n\n\uf057 20 \uf02b 2 2\nm \uf067 L\n\uf0a4c V T T\n\nDis\n\n8.26\n\uf0dfW\uf0e0\nDis\n\n8.26a\n\uf0dfW\uf0e0\n\n\uf0572\n\nwhere: \uf0a4c0 \uf03d \uf04c is the magnetic fine structure constant, introduced in our theory.

The nonzero contribution of the rest\nmass energy to photons and neutrino energy is a consequence of the enhanced refraction\nindex of secondary Bivacuum and corresponding decreasing of the effective light velocity.\nThe latter can be revealed by small shift of Doppler effect in EM radiation of the probe in\ngravitational field. The 'Pioneer anomaly' (Turushev et al., 2005) is a good example of\nsuch phenomena.\n8.13 Application of angular momentum conservation law for evaluation\nof curvatures of electric and gravitational potentials\nFrom the formulas of total energy of \uf0dfW\uf0e0 phase of unpaired sub-elementary fermion\n(8.17) of triplet \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 S\uf03d0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb S\uf03d\uf0b11/2 \uf03e e,\uf062 we can find out the relation between the\nsum of internal and external angular momentum of CVC, including the electric and\ngravitational increments of CVC of [W\uf0e0 phase for the one side, and a sum of corresponding\nrecoil angular momentums, for the other.\n\n8.57\n\n\f84\nFor the end of convenience, this expression can be subdivided to the internal \uf0dfM in\n0\uf0e0\next\n(zero-point) and external \uf0dfM \uf056 \uf0e0 contributions to the total angular momentum \uf0dfM tot \uf0e0:\next\nM tot \uf03d M in\n0 \uf02b M\uf056\n\n8.58\n\nIt follows from the law of angular momentum conservation, that the angular\nmomentums of Cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) and the recoil (rec) angular momentums,\naccompanied \uf0dfC \uf0b8 W\uf0e0 transitions of sub-elementary fermions, should be equal:\n0\n0\nM in\n0 \uf03d \uf0dfR \uf04am 0 cL E \uf02b R \uf04bm 0 c L G \uf0e0 rec \uf03d \uf0dfR m 0 c L 0 \uf03f R \uf04am 0 c L 0 \uf03f R \uf04bm 0 c L 0 \uf0e0 CVC\n\n8.59\n\nwhere the internal momentum of elementary particle at Golden mean (zero-point)\nconditions:\n\uf02b\n\uf03f \uf064\n\uf02b 2 \uf064\np in\n0 \uf03d m 0 c \uf03d |m V \uf03f m V | c \uf03d \uf0ddm V v \uf0de /c\n\n8.60\n\nL 0 \uf03d \uf0a4/m 0 c\n\n8.60a\n\nCompton radius\n\nand the external contribution to angular momentum:\next\next\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\nM ext\n\uf056 \uf03d \uf0df\uf04am V vL E \uf02b \uf04bm V vL G \uf0e0 rec \uf03d \uf0dfm V v L B \uf03f \uf04am V v L B \uf03f \uf04bm V v L B \uf0e0 CVC\n\n8.61\n\nwhere the external momentum of particle is directly related to its de Broglie wave\nlength (\uf056 B \uf03d 2\uf05eL B \uf03d h/m \uf02bV v\uf0de:\np ext \uf03d m \uf02bV v \uf03d h/\uf056 B \uf03d \uf0a4\nLB\n\n8.62\n\nThe sum of zero-point and angular momentums is:\n0\next\n\uf02b\nM tot \uf03d \uf04a\uf0ddR m 0 cL 0E \uf02b m \uf02bV vL ext\nE \uf0de rec \uf02b \uf04b\uf0ddR m 0 c L G \uf02b m V vL G \uf0de rec \uf03d\n\n\uf03d R m0c L0 \uf02b\n\nm \uf02bV v L B\n\n\uf03f \uf04a\uf0ddR m 0 c L 0 \uf02b\n\nm \uf02bV v L B \uf0de CVC\n\n\uf03f \uf04b\uf0ddR m 0 c L 0 \uf02b\n\n8.63\nm \uf02bV v L B \uf0de CVC\n\nThe minimum space curvatures, related to electromagnetism, corresponding to\nzero-point longitudinal recoil effects, accompanied \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation, can be find out\nfrom (8.59), reflecting the angular momentum conservation law, as:\n1 \uf03f1\nL 0E \uf03d L\uf04a0 \uf0dd1 \uf03f \uf04a \uf03f 2\uf04b\uf0de \uf072 L 0 \uf04a\n\n\uf03d a B \uf03f L 0 \uf03d 136, 036 L 0\n\n8.64\n\n\uf04b \uf03c\uf03c\uf03c \uf04a \uf03d 0, 0072973506 \uf072 1/137\nWe can see, that the space curvature, characteristic for electric potential of the electron\nat Golden Mean (zero-point) conditions (L 0E \uf0de is very close to the radius of the 1st Bohr\norbit \uf0dda B \uf0de in hydrogen atom:\n1 L 0 \uf03d 137, 036 L 0 \uf03d 0. 5291 \uf036 10 \uf03f10 m\naB \uf03d \uf04a\n\n8.65\n\nIn similar way we can find from (8.59) zero-point Bivacuum curvature, determined by\nelementary particle gravitational potential:\nL 0G \uf03d\n\n\uf056 0G\n0\n\uf03d L 0 \uf0dd1 \uf03f 2\uf04a \uf03f \uf04b\uf0de \uf072 Le,p\n2\uf05e\n\uf04b\n\uf04b\np\n\nwhere: \uf04b e \uf03d \uf0ddm e0 /M Pl \uf0de 2 \uf03d 1. 7385 \uf036 10 \uf03f45 ; \uf04b p \uf03d \uf0ddm 0 /M Pl \uf0de 2 \uf03d 5. 86 \uf036 10 \uf03f39 are\nintroduced in our theory gravitational fine structure constant, different for electrons and\n\n8.66\n\n\f85\nprotons; M Pl \uf03d \uf0dd\uf0a4c/G\uf0de 1/2 \uf03d 2. 17671 \uf036 10 \uf03f8 kg is a Plank mass; m e0 \uf03d 9. 109534 \uf036 10 \uf03f31 kg\np\nis a rest mass of the electron; m 0 \uf03d 1. 6726485 \uf036 10 \uf03f27 kg \uf03d m e0 \uf036 1. 8361515 \uf036 10 3 kg is a\nrest mass of proton.\nThe length of one light year is 9. 46 \uf036 10 15 m.

Pauli principle: How it works ?\nLet us consider the reasons why the Pauli principle \"works\" for fermions and do not\nwork for bosons. In accordance to our model of elementary particles, the numbers of\nsub-elementary fermions and sub-elementary antifermions, forming bosons, like photons\n(Fig.4), are equal. Each of sub-elementary fermion and sub-elementary antifermion in\nsymmetric pairs \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0bb \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0bb \uf0e0 of bosons can pulsate between their [C] and [W] states in-phase\n(S \uf03d 0\uf0de or counterphase (S \uf03d \uf0b11\uf0a4\uf0de. In both cases the positive and negative subquantum\nparticles, forming CVC \uf02b and CVC \uf03f do not overlap, as far they are in realms of opposite\nenergy.\nFor the other hand, the numbers of sub-elementary particles and sub-elementary\nantiparticles in composition of fermions (i.e. triplets \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i are not equal to\neach other. Consequently, the CVC \uf02b and CVC \uf03f of sub-elementary fermions and\nantifermions in triplets do not compensated each other. It leads to the external oscillations\nof Bivacuum subquantum particles density in the process of [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation, which can\nbe uncompensated also.\nIn the framework of our model, Pauli repulsion effect between fermions with the same\nspin states and energy, i.e. the same phase and frequency of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation, is similar\nto the effect of excluded volume.\nThis effect is provided by spatial incompatibility of two cumulative virtual clouds:\nCVC \uf0b11 and CVC \uf0b12 of the anchor Bivacuum fermions of unpaired sub-elementary particles\nof triplets, emitted in the same moment of time in the same volume. The latter is a case, if\nthe distance between CVC \uf0b11 and CVC \uf0b12 is equal or less, than space of their superposition\n\uf0dfCVC \uf0b11 \uf02b CVC \uf0b12 \uf0e0, determined by doubled de Broglie wave length of triplets:\n\uf056 B \uf03d \uf056 CVC \uf03d h/m \uf02bV v ext .\nLet us analyze this situation in more detail.\nC\uf0f0W\nThe average external translational kinetic energy (T tot \uf0de of fermions\n\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i is:\n\n8.71\n8.71a\n\n\f87\nC\uf0f0W\n\nT tot\n\nDist\n\uf03d T tot \uf0b1 \uf0ddE E \uf0de Loc\n\uf0dfC\uf0e0 \uf03f \uf0ddE E \uf0de \uf0dfW\uf0e0\n\ntr\n\n9.1\n\nIt involves opposite by sign oscillation of local/internal Coulomb potential interaction\nLoc\nof the anchor Bivacuum fermion of F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i , transforming to distant\nin [C] phase |eL\uf02b eT\uf03f |\nkinetic recoil perturbation of Bivacuum matrix \uf04a\uf0df\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 \uf0e0 Dis , representing electric\nfield, in the process of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation:\nE E \uf0de Loc\n\uf0dfC\uf0e0 \uf03d\n\n|e \uf02b e \uf03f |\nLT\n\nLoc\n\n\uf03d \uf04a\uf0dfm \uf02bV \uf067 2B L 2B \uf0e0\n\nLoc\n\n\uf0dfC\uf0f0W\uf0e0\n\n\uf0f0\n\nDist\n\uf04a\uf0df\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 \uf0e0 Dis \uf03d \uf04a\uf0dfm \uf02bV v 2 \uf0e0 Dis \uf03d \uf0ddE E \uf0de \uf0dfW\uf0e0\n9.2\n\nThe energy of the anchor site of unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf03e i in [W] phase of triplet, equal to\nexternal energy of de Broglie wave:\nDist\n\uf02b T CVC\nE anc \uf03d E B \uf03d \uf0ddE E \uf0de \uf0dfW\uf0e0\nk\n\n\uf0b1\n\n9.3\n\ncan be presented as a sum of energy of electric field, equal to recoil energy:\nDist\n\uf0ddE E \uf0de \uf0dfW\uf0e0\n\uf03d \uf04a\uf0df\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 \uf0e0 Dis \uf03d \uf04a\uf0dfm \uf02bV v 2 \uf0e0 Dis ~ \uf050 C \uf0ddelectric field energy\uf0de\n\n9.4\n\nand real energy of CVC \uf0b1 , equal to maximum kinetic energy of cumulative virtual cloud\nh2\n\uf03d m \uf02bV v 2 minus recoil energy:\nm\uf02b \uf056 2\nV B\n\n\uf0b1\n\n\uf03d\nT CVC\nk\n\nh 2 \uf03f \uf04a\uf0dfm \uf02b v 2 \uf0e0 \uf03d m \uf02b v 2 \uf0dd1 \uf03f \uf04a\uf0de ~ \uf050 P\nV\nV\nm \uf02bV \uf056 2B\n\n9.5\n\nThe Coulomb repulsion \uf0dd\uf050 C \uf0de between two similar elementary charge is determined by\nelectric field energy (9.4).

These conditions may occur in the process of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of\nsub-elementary fermions, composing elementary bosons, like photons, and complex bosons\n- neutral atoms. In these two situations the effect of excluded volume is absent and\n\n9.6\n\n\f88\nfermions are spatially compatible. The mechanism, proposed, explains the absence of the\nPauli repulsion in systems of Bosons and Cooper pairs, making possible their Bose\ncondensation.\n9.1 Spatial compatibility of sub-elementary fermions\nof the same charge and opposite spins\nWe postulate in our model, that [C \uf0f9 W] pulsation of paired sub-elementary fermion\nand antifermion \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 of opposite spins in composition of the electron\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e or positron \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf03e\uf0e0 are counterphase with pulsation of\nunpaired F \uf0b1\uf0b7 \uf03e (see the upper part of Fig. 8).\n\uf0dd1\uf0de\nIn the case of counterphase [C \uf0f9 W] pulsations of paired \uf0dfF \uf0b1\uf0b9 \uf0e0 and unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0b7 \uf03e \uf0dd2\uf0de\nwith opposite spins, but similar charges, localized in the same energy realm, they are\nspatially compatible, as far their corpuscular [C] and wave [W] phase are realized\nalternatively in different semi-periods. Consequently, the Pauli repulsion, described above,\nis absent.\nThe example of such compatible pairs in composition of the electron or positron is\npresented on (Fig.8).\n\nFig. 8.

The actual inertial mass\n(m \uf02bV \uf0de and energy of the electron also is determined by this unpaired/uncompensated\nsub-elementary fermion.\nThe dynamics of sub-elementary fermions of positron \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf03e\uf0e0 is similar to\nthat of electron, determined, however, by unpaired sub-elementary antifermion\n\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0bb \uf0de S\uf03d\uf0b11/2 \uf03e.\nThe process of the triplets of sub-elementary fermions spin state inversion needs 720 0\nnot 360 0 . It will be explained in the next section.\n\n\f89\n9.2 The double turn (720 0 \uf0de of magnetic field, as a condition of the fermions\nspin state reversibility\nIt is known fact, that the total rotating cycle for spin of the electrons or positrons is not\n360 0 , but 720 0 , i.e. double turn by external magnetic field of special configuration, is\nnecessary to return elementary fermions to starting state (Davies, 1985). The correctness of\nany new model of elementary particles should be testified by its ability to explain this\nnontrivial fact.\nWe may propose three possible explanations, using our model of the electrons,\npositrons, protons and antiprotons, as a triplets of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions.\nLet us analyze them on example of the electron:\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e e\n\n9.5\n\n1. We may assume, that the direction of external magnetic field rotation acts only on\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion, as asymmetric [torus (V \uf03f \uf0de \uf02b antitorus (V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0 pair:\nF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03d \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0ec V \uf02b \uf0de as , if the resulting magnetic moment of pair \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 is zero and the\npair do not interact with external magnetic field at all. In such conditions the 1st 360 0 turn\nof external H field change the direction of rotation of one of two toruses rotation to the\nopposite one: V \uf03f \uf0b7 \uf0b8 V \uf03f \uf0b9, transforming sub-elementary fermion to sub-elementary\n360 0\nboson: \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0af \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0ec V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0 \uf0ed \uf0dfB \uf03f \uf0af \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0b9\uf0b7 V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0. One more 360 0 turn of the external\nmagnetic field converts this sub-elementary boson and the triplet (9.5) to starting condition.\nThe total cycle for unpaired F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e of triplet can be presented as:\n\uf0ddI\uf0de\n\n360 0\n\n360 0\n\n\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e \uf0af \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0ec V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0 \uf0ed \uf0dfB \uf03f \uf0af \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0b9\uf0b7 V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0 \uf0ed \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e \uf0af \uf0ddV \uf03f \uf0ec V \uf02b \uf0de\uf0e0\n\n9.6\n\n2. The second possible explanation of double 720 0 turn may be a consequence of\nfollowing two stages, involving origination of pair of sub-elementary bosons \uf0ddB \uf0b1 \uf039 B \uf0b1 \uf0de\nfrom pair of sub-elementary fermions, as intermediate stage and two full turns (2 \uf036 360 0 \uf0de of\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion:\n\uf0ddII\uf0de\n\n360 0\n\n\uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e \uf0b8 \uf03c \uf0dfB \uf0b1 \uf039 B \uf0b1 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e\n\n360 0\n\n\uf0b8 \uf03c \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e\n\n9.7\n\nBoth of these mechanisms are not very probable, because they involve the action of\nexternal magnetic field on single or paired sub-elementary bosons with zero spin and,\nconsequently, zero magnetic moment.\n3. The most probable third mechanism avoids such strong assumption. The external\nrotating H field interact in two stage manner (2 \uf036 360 0 \uf0de only with sub-elementary\nfermions/antifermions, changing their spins. However this mechanism demands that the\nangle of spin rotation of sub-elementary particle and antiparticles of neutral pairs\n\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 are the additive parameters. It means that turn of resulting spin of pair on 360 0\nincludes reorientation spins of each F \uf02b\uf0b7 and F \uf03f\uf0b9 only on 180 0 . Consequently, the full spin\nturn of pair \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 resembles that of Mobius transformation.\nThe spin of unpaired sub-elementary fermion F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf03e, in contrast to paired ones, makes a\nfull turn each 360 0 , i.e. twice in 720 0 cycle:\n\uf03c \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de x \uf039 \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de y \uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de z \uf03e\n360 0\n\n\uf0ed\n\n360 0\n\n\uf0ed\n\n\uf03c \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0de x\n\n180 0 \uf02b180 0\n\n\uf039\n\n\uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de y \uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de z \uf03e \uf0b8\n\n\uf03c \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de x \uf039 \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de y \uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de z \uf03e\n\nThe difference between the intermediate - 2nd stage and the original one in (9.8) is in\n\n9.8\n\n\f90\nopposite spin states of paired sub-elementary particle and antiparticle:\n360 0\n\n\uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf0de x \uf039 \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de y \uf0e0 \uf0ed \uf0df\uf0ddF \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0de x\n\n180 0 \uf02b180 0\n\n\uf039\n\n\uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de y \uf0e0\n\n9.9\n\nBecause of Pauli repulsion (see previous section) between two sub-elementary fermions\nof the same spin state \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de y and \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de z \uf03e, in intermediate state of (9.8), the corresponding\ntriplet configuration has deformed - stretched configuration, different from original and\nfinal ones.\nIn the latter - equilibrium configurations of triplet, the \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of unpaired\nsub-elementary fermion \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de z \uf03e and paired \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0de y is counterphase and spatially compatible\ndue to the absence of Pauli repulsion.\nOne more known \"strange\" experimental result can be explained by our dynamic model\nof triplets of elementary particles. The existence in triplets paired in-phase pulsating\nsub-elementary fermions (9.9) with opposite charge, representing double electric dipoles\n(i.e. double charge), can be responsible for two times stronger magnetic field, generated by\nelectron, as compared with those, generated by rotating sphere with single charge |e \uf03f |.\n9.3. Bosons as a coherent system of sub-elementary and elementary fermions\nThe spatial image of sub-elementary boson is a superposition of strongly correlated\nsub-elementary fermions with opposite charges and spin states with properties of Cooper\npairs. In general case the elementary bosons are composed from the integer number of such\npairs.\nBosons have zero or integer spin \uf0dd0, 1, 2\uf075 \uf0de in the \uf0a4 units, in contrast to the half integer\nspins of fermions. In general case, bosons with S \uf03d 1 include: photons, gluons, mesons and\nboson resonances, phonons, pairs of elementary fermions with opposite spins, atoms and\nmolecules.\nWe subdivide bosons into elementary and complex bosons:\n1. Elementary bosons (like photons), composed from equal number of sub-elementary\nfermions and antifermions, moving with light velocity in contrast to complex bosons, like\natoms;\n2. Complex bosons, represent a coherent system of elementary fermions (electrons and\nnucleons), like neutral atoms and molecules.\nFormation of stable complex bosons from elementary fermions with different actual\nmasses: \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de 1 \uf0ae \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de 2 is possible due to their electromagnetic attraction, like in\nproton \uf02b electron pairs in atoms. It may occur, if the length of their waves B are the same\nand equal to distance between them. These conditions may be achieved by difference in\ntheir external group velocities, adjusting the momentums to the same value:\nL 1 \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0ddm \uf02bV v\uf0de 1 \uf03d L 2 \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0ddm \uf02bV v\uf0de 2 \uf075 \uf03d L n \uf03d \uf0a4/\uf0ddm \uf02bV v\uf0de n\nat :\n\nv 1 /v n \uf03d \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de n /\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf0de 1\n\nThe mentioned above conditions are the base for assembly of complex bosons, unified\nin the volume of 3D standing waves of fermions of the opposite or same spins.\nThe hydrogen atom, composing from two fermions: electron and proton is a simplest\nexample of complex bosons. The heavier atoms also follow the same principle of\nself-organization.\nThe elementary boson, such as photon, represents dynamic superposition of two triplets\nof sub-elementary fermions and antifermions, corresponding to electron and positron\nstructures. Such composition determines the resulting external charge of photon, equal to\nzero and the value of photon's spin: J \uf03d \uf02b1, 0 or -1.\n\n9.10\n\n\f91\nStability of all types of elementary particles: bosons and fermions (electrons, positrons\netc.) is a result of superposition/exchange of cumulative virtual clouds [CVC \uf02b \uf039 CVC \uf03f ]\nwith gluon properties, emitted and absorbed in the process of in-phase [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsations\nof paired sub-elementary particles and sub-elementary antiparticles [F \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 (Fig.9).\n\nFig. 9.

The F \uf02b\uf0b7 and F \uf03f\uf0b9 ,\npulsing in-phase between the corpuscle and wave states compensate the mass, spin and\ncharge of each other. Such a pair is a neutral component of elementary particles, like\nelectrons, positrons, protons, neutrons, etc. Properties of symmetric pair of \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0:\nresulting electric charge is zero; resulting magnetic charge is zero; resulting spin:\nS \uf0dfF \uf02b \uf02b F \uf03f \uf0e0 \uf03d \uf0b11, 0.\n\nThe neutral symmetric pairs of \uf062 generations \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf062,\uf057\n, forming part of triplets S\uf03d0,1\nprotons have a properties of mesons, as a neutral [quark \uf02b antiquark] pairs with integer\n\uf0e6\nspin. The coherent cluster of such pairs - from one to four pairs: \uf0ddn \uf0dfq \uf02b \uf039 q \uf03f \uf0e0\uf0de S\uf03d0,1,2,3,4 can\nprovide the experimentally revealed integer spins of mesons - from zero to four.\n10 The Mystery of Sri Yantra Diagram\nIn accordance to ancient archetypal ideas, geometry and numbers describe the\nfundamental energies in course of their dance - dynamics, transitions. For more than ten\nmillenniums it was believed that the famous Tantric diagram-Sri Yantra contains in hidden\nform the basic functions active in the Universe (Fig. 10).\n\n\f92\nFig. 10. The Sri Yantra diagram is composed from nine triangles. Four of them are pointed\nup and five down.\nIn another way this diagram can be considered as superposition of:\na) the set of pairs of cones of opposite apex, corresponding to torus and antitorus of\nasymmetric Bivacuum fermions in [C] phase in different excitation states (see Fig. 11a) and\nb) the set of diamonds, corresponding to [W] phase of corresponding excitation states of\nBivacuum fermions (dashed lines).\nAuthor is grateful to P. Flanagan for submitting of Sri Yantra diagram with precise\ncoordinates of most important points, making possible its quantitative analysis.\n\nTriangle is a symbol of a three-fold Nature. The Christian trinity, the symbol of God\nmay be represented by triangle. The symbol of trinity is coherent to our idea of triplets of\nsub-elementary particles and antiparticles, as elementary particles. In Buddhism-Hindu\ntriangle with apex up is a symbol of God-male and that with apex down is a symbol of\nGod-female.\nFor millenniums it was believed, that Sri Yantra diagram represents geometric\nlanguage, containing encrypted information about the principles of matter formation.\nLet us analyze this diagram, using notions of our theory of elementary particles\norigination from Bivacuum dipoles and the mechanism of corpuscle - wave duality.\nFirst of all, the ratio 5:4 between positive and negative energy states may reflect the\nprimordial asymmetry of torus and antitorus of Bivacuum dipoles, as a condition of matter\norigination.\nWe may see also, that Sri Yantra diagram contains the information about duality of\nsub-elementary fermions, forming elementary particles, i.e. their discrete corpuscular [C]\nand wave [W] phases. The diagram at Fig.10 can be considered as a superposition of:\na) set of pairs of cones of opposite apex, corresponding to asymmetric torus and\nantitorus of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions in [C] phase in different excitation states (see\nFig. 11a, where the diameters of bases of pairs of cones correspond to diameters of torus\nand antitorus of Bivacuum fermions) and\nb) set of diamonds, corresponding to [W] phase of Bivacuum fermions in different\nexcitation states.\nIn accordance to our theory of sub-elementary fermion/antifermion origination (section\n4), the former set (a) describes their [C] phase with different diameters of opposite cones\nbases, characterizing symmetry shift between torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de,\ncorrespondingly. The asymmetry of torus and antitorus is increasing with Bivacuum\nfermion excitation state, accompanied by decreasing of spatial separation between them.\nFrom formula (1.4) for this separation:\n[d V \uf02b \uf0faV \uf03f ] in \uf03d\n\nh\n\nm i0 c\uf0dd1\n\n\uf02b 2n\uf0de\n\nwe can see, that the distance between torus and antitorus decreases with quantum number\n(n) increasing, indeed.\nIt was astounding to find out, that at maximum excitation and maximum asymmetry of\nBivacuum dipole, corresponding to minimum diamond dimension (Fig.11b), the ratio of\ndown diameter of cone/torus base to that of upper antitorus is 0. 6, i.e. practically coincide\nwith Golden mean (\uf064 \uf03d 0. 618). For the other hand, it follows from our Unified theory, that\njust this critical ratio of torus and antitorus diameters: 2L \uf02b /2L \uf03f \uf03d \uf064 (see eq. 4.15) is a\ncondition of the rest mass and charge origination, as a crucial stage of elementary fermions\n(electrons, protons, neutrons) fusion from sub-elementary ones (section 5).\n\n10.1\n\n\f93\n\nFig. 11a. Part of Sri Yantra diagram, representing set of pairs of cones of opposite apex,\ncorresponding to torus and antitorus of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions in [C] phase in\ndifferent excitation states. The diameters of bases of pairs of cones corresponds to diameters\nof torus and antitorus of Bivacuum fermions.\nFig. 11b. Superposition of [C] and [W] phase of asymmetric Bivacuum fermion,\ncorresponding to critical state of excitation and asymmetry, determined by Golden mean\ncondition. This state is characterized by origination of the rest mass and charge, turning\nBivacuum fermion to sub-elementary fermion. The next stage of matter organization from\nBivacuum is fusion of triplets of elementary fermions from sub-elementary fermions.\n\nThe diamonds of increasing as respect to Fig.11b dimensions, incorporated in Sri\nYantra diagram (Fig.10), reflects [W] phase of Bivacuum dipoles of different excitation\nstates in form of Cumulative Virtual Clouds \uf0dfCVC\uf0e0, emitted and absorbed in the process of\nquantum beats between asymmetric states of torus and antitorus.\nThe probability of coincidental correlation of quantitative and qualitative features of Sri\nYantra diagram properties with key features of our theory of elementary particles is very\nlow. It is a surprise, indeed, that only 10 millenniums after famous Sri Yantra diagram\nbecame known in mankind history, we became ready for understanding its encrypted\ninformation about principles of Universe construction.\n11 The Link Between Maxwell's Formalism and Unified Theory\nUsing (7.18a), the quantization rule for photons can be expressed as:\n\n\f94\n\uf02b\n\n\uf02b\n\nn E el \uf03d n \uf0a4\uf067 C\uf0f0W \uf03d \uf04a n\uf0a4\uf0df\uf067 V \uf03f\uf067 \uf03fV \uf0e0 \uf03d \uf04a n\uf0ddm V \uf03fm \uf03fV \uf0dec 2\n\n11.1\n\n\uf03f\n\nwhere: m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d n \uf0a4\uf067 \uf02bV and m V c 2 \uf03d n \uf0a4\uf067 \uf03fV are the quantized energies of the actual\nvortex and complementary torus of sub-elementary particle.\nFrom this formula one can see that the electromagnetic energy is a result of quantum\nbeats with frequency (\uf067 C\uf0f0W ) between the actual and complementary corpuscular states of\ntwo uncompensated sub-elementary fermions with additive spins in composition of photons\n\uf0ddFig. 4\uf0de.\nThe electromagnetic contribution to the total energy of wave B (11.1) is defined by the\nfine structure constant, as a factor:\n\uf02b\n\uf03f\nE E \uf03d \uf04aE C\uf0f0W \uf03d \uf04an \uf0a4\uf067 B \uf03d \uf04an \uf0a4\uf0dd\uf067 \uf02bV \uf03f \uf067 \uf03fV \uf0de \uf03d \uf04a \uf0a4\uf0dfrot V \uf03f rot V \uf0e0\n2\n\n11.2\n\nwhere: n is a unit-vector, common for both vortices; \uf067 CVC \uf03d \uf0dd\uf067 \uf02bV \uf03f \uf067 \uf03fV \uf0de is a beats\nfrequency between actual vortex and complementary toruses/vortices with angle velocities:\n\uf02b\n\uf03f\nV and V , depending on radiuses of torus and antitorus.\nIt is assumed, that all of subquantum particles/antiparticles, forming actual and\ncomplementary vortices/toruses of [C] phase of sub-elementary fermions, have the same\nangle frequency: \uf067 \uf02bV and \uf067 \uf03fV and velocities, correspondingly.\nWe can express the divergency of Pointing vector: P \uf03d \uf0ddc/4\uf05e\uf0de\uf0dfEH\uf0e0 via difference of\ncontributions, related to actual and complementary toruses, using known relation of vector\nanalysis:\ndiv\uf0dfEH\uf0e0 \uf03d 4\uf05e\nc div P \uf03d H rotE \uf03f E rotH\n\n11.3\n\nwhere H and E are the magnetic and electric energy contributions of subquantum\nparticles, radiated and absorbed in a course of correlated [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of two\nuncompensated sub-elementary fermions of photon.\nTwo structures of photon, corresponding to its two polarization and spin \uf0ddS \uf03d \uf0b11\uf0a4\uf0de,\ncan be presented as:\n\uf0d62\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0\uf0d7\n\nS \uf03d \uf03f1\n\n11.4\n\n\uf0d62\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf02b F \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0e0\uf0d7\n\nS \uf03d \uf02b1\n\n11.4a\n\nThe analogy between (11.2) and (11.3), illustrating the dynamics of [torus \uf02b antitorus]\ndipole, is evident, if we assume:\n\uf02b\n\uf0a4\uf067 \uf02bV \uf069 H rotE ~ \uf04a \uf0a4 rot V\n2\n\uf03f\n\uf04a\n\uf0a4\uf067 \uf03fV \uf069 E rotH ~ \uf0a4 rot V\n2\n\n11.5\n11.5a\n\nThen, the divergence of Pointing vector will take a form:\n4\uf05e div P \uf03d \uf04a \uf0a4 rot V \uf02b \uf03f rot V \uf03f ~ \uf04a\uf0dfm \uf02b \uf03fm \uf03f \uf0e0c 2\nV\nV\nc\n2\nWe can see from 11.5 and 11.5a, that the properties of both: magnetic and electric fields\nare implemented in each of our torus and antitorus of Bivacuum dipoles. The mechanism of\nthis implementation was discussed in sections (8.6 - 8.8).\nWe may apply also the Green theorems, interrelating the volume and surface integrals,\nto our duality model.

Completely reversible.\nUsing relations (12.12) and relativistic expression for kinetic energy of system or\nmechanical object:\nT k \uf03d m \uf02bV v 2 /2 \uf03d 1 m 0 v 2 / 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n2\nthe pace of time and time of action for closed system can be presented via acceleration and\nvelocity of one or more parts, composing this system (Kaivarainen, 2004, 2005):\n\n12.12a\n\n\f98\n\ndt \uf03d d ln t\nt\n\n2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\uf03d \uf03f dv\nv 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n12.13\nx,y,z\n\nWe proceed from the fact, that the true inertial frames in our accelerating, rotating and\ngravitating Universe and in all of its lower levels formations and subsystems - are\nnonexisting.\nThe dynamics and accelerations in each closed conservative system, where\nE tot \uf03d const, are characterized by its dimensionless pace of time (12.13) and time itself:\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nt\uf03d \uf03f v\na 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n12.14\nx,y,z\n\nwhere the acceleration in different kinds of motion can be expressed in different forms:\n2\na \uf03d dv/dt \uf03d vr \uf03d \uf067 2 r\nor : a \uf03d G M2 - free fall acceleration\nr\n\nThe external reference frame for selected conservative system can be only the another\ninertialess system/frame, including the former one as a part and with other relativistic\nfactor: R 2 \uf03d 1 \uf03f\uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 . In such approach the internal time \uf0ddt in \uf0de of smaller system can be\nanalyzed as a part of external time of bigger conservative system \uf0ddt ext \uf0de :\nt in \uf03d\n\nv 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nt ext\n\uf03d\uf03f\na \uf0df2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf0e0\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv ext /c\uf0de 2\n\nThe shape of this formula in conditions, when t ext \uf03d const is close to to conventional\nformula of special relativity (12.15a) for time or clock, moving with velocity \uf0ddv \uf0c0 c\uf0de\nrelatively to the clock in rest (v\uf03c\uf03cc).\nFrom (12.14) we can see, that the time for selected object (microscopic or macroscopic)\nof conservative system is positive at velocity: 0 \uf03c v \uf03c c, if its acceleration is negative\n(dv/dt \uf03c 0\uf0de. On contrary, time is negative, if acceleration is positive (dv/dt \uf03e 0\uf0de. For\nexample, if temperature of conservative system and its kinetic energy are decreasing, the\ntime and its pace are positive.\nThermal oscillations of atoms and molecules in condensed matter, like pendulums\noscillation, are accompanied by alternation the sign of acceleration and, consequently, sign\nof time (\uf0b1t ext and \uf0b1t in \uf0de.\nThe Corpuscle \uf0b8 Wave transition of elementary particle, as it follows from Unified\ntheory, is accompanied by decreasing of mass and kinetic energy of unpaired\nsub-elementary fermion and converting the kinetic energy of [C] phase to potential energy\nof CVC \uf0b1 of [W] phase. Consequently, this semiperiod of pulsation is characterized by\npositive time \uf0ddt \uf03e 0\uf0de C\uf0b8W . On contrary, the reverse \uf0dfW \uf0b8 C\uf0e0 transition corresponds to\nnegative time \uf0ddt \uf03c 0\uf0de W\uf0b8C .\nIn the absence of particles acceleration (a \uf03d dv/dt \uf03d 0; dT k /T k \uf03d 0 and\nc \uf03e v \uf03e 0; \uf0de, the time of action (t) is infinitive and its pace (dt/t) is zero:\n\n12.14a\n\n\f99\n\nt\uf0b8\uf04b\nat\n\na \uf03d dv/dt \uf0b8 0\n\ndt\nt\n\nand\nand\n\n\uf0b80\n\nv \uf03d const\n\nThe infinitive life-time of the system means its absolute stability. The postulated by this\nauthor principle of conservation of internal kinetic energy of torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de\n\uf064\n\uf0bb\nof symmetric and asymmetric Bivacuum fermions/antifermions: BVF as \uf0af F \uf0b1\uf0bb (eq.2.1),\nindependently on their external velocity, in fact reflects the condition of infinitive life-time\nof Bivacuum dipoles in symmetric and asymmetric states. The latter means a stability of\nsub-elementary fermions and elementary particles, formed by them.\nThe permanent collective motion of the electrons in superconductors and atoms of 4 He\nin superfluid liquids with constant velocity (v \uf03d const\uf0de and dv/dt \uf03d 0 in the absence of\ncollisions and accelerations are good examples, confirming validity of our formula (12.14),\nas far in these conditions t \uf0b8 \uf04b.\nWhen the external translational velocity and external accelerations of Bivacuum dipoles\n(BVF and BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de are zero: v \uf03d 0 and dv/dt \uf03d 0, like in primordial Bivacuum, the notion\nof time is uncertain: t \uf03d 0/0.\nInteresting, that similar uncertainty in time (12.14) corresponds to opposite limit\ncondition, pertinent for photon or neutrino in primordial Bivacuum, when v \uf03d c \uf03d const\nand dv/dt \uf03d 0. Just in such conditions when causality principle do not work the\nanomalous time effects are possible.\nIn our approach, the velocity of light is the absolute value, determined by physical\nproperties of Bivacuum, like sound velocity in any medium is determined by elastic\nproperties of medium. The primordial Bivacuum superfluid matrix represents the Universal\nReference Frame (URF) in contrast to conventional Relative Reference Frame (RRF).\nConsequently the Bivacuum has the Ether properties and Bivacuum dipoles - the properties\nof ethons - elements of the Ether.\nThe positive acceleration of the Universe expansion (dv/dt \uf03e 0\uf0de at c \uf03e v \uf03e 0, in\naccordance to (12.13 and 12.14), means negative pace of external time and time itself for\nthis highest Hierarchical level of Bivacuum organization. For the other hand, the process of\ncooling of each regular star system, like our Solar system, following gradual cooling of\nstar, means slowing down the internal kinetic energy of thermal motion of atoms and\nmolecules in such system, i.e. negative acceleration (dv/dt \uf03c 0\uf0de at c \uf03e v \uf03e 0. It\ncorresponds to positive internal time and its pace in star systems. These opposite sign and\nthe 'arrow' direction of time of action on different hierarchical levels of Universe\norganization, possibly is a consequence of tending of the Universe to keep its total energy\npermanent, following energy conservation law.\nIn accordance with Einstein relativistic theory (Landau and Lifshitz, 1988), the time of\nclock in the rest state (t ext \uf0de, which can be considered, as the external inertial frame is\ninterrelated with time (t in \uf0de in other inertial frame, moving relatively to former with velocity\n(v) as:\nt ext \uf03d \uf0ddt \uf0762 \uf03f t \uf0761 \uf0de\nt in \uf03d\next\n\nt in\n\next\n\n\uf03d t in 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\nt ext\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\nwhere: t ext \uf0af \uf0ddt \uf0762 \uf03f t \uf0761 \uf0de is the characteristic time of clock in the reference rest frame;\n\uf0af \uf0ddt 2 \uf03f t 1 \uf0de in is the internal proper time of clock, moving with velocity: v \uf0c0 c, relatively\n\n12.15\n12.15a\n\n\f100\nto clock in the rest frame.\nIt is easy to see, that in relativistic conditions, when v in \uf0b8 c, the proper time of moving\nsystem/clock is tending to infinity: (T ~ t in \uf0b8 \uf04b\uf0de. This means that the moving clock is\nslower, than similar clock in state of rest relatively to moving one.\nIf we consider the imaginary system, containing only two clock in empty space,\nmoving as respect to each other with permanent velocity, and use the 1st postulate of\nSpecial Relativity, i.e. similar laws of physics in any inertial system, we should get the\nsimilar time delay in both clocks, even if they move with different velocities in our\nUniversal Reference Frame (URF) - Bivacuum. In other words, both clocks should display\nthe same time delay, independently of difference of their velocities ratio to the light\nvelocity (v/c) 2 . This result of special relativity is a consequence of assumption of the\nabsence of Ether and absolute velocity. It sounds like a nonsense and has no experimental\nconfirmation. It follows from our Unified theory, that the interpretation, given by Einstein\nto Michelson-Morley experiments, as the evidence of the Ether absence, was wrong in\ncontrast to explanation, provided by the authors of this experiment themselves.\nOur formulas (12.14 and 12.14a), describing the properties of time (time of action) for\nconservative systems, are more advanced, than Einstein's (12.15a), as far they are not\nlimited by inertialess frames and contain not only the relativistic factor, but also the\nvelocity itself and acceleration. It will be demonstrated below, that our time of action\nconcept better describe the dynamic processes on microscopic - quantum and macroscopic\n- cosmic scales.\nDifferent closed conservative systems of particles/objects, rotating around common\ncenter on stable orbits with radius \uf0ddr\uf0de, like in Cooper pairs of sub-elementary fermions,\natoms, planetary systems, galactics, etc. are characterized by centripetal (a cp \uf0de and\ncentrifugal (a cen \uf0de acceleration, equal by absolute value:\n2\n\na cp \uf03d \uf03f dv \uf03d v \uf03d \uf067 2 r \uf03d \uf03fa cen\ndt\nr\n\n12.16\n\nwhere the tangential velocity of rotation is related to the radius r and angular\nfrequency of orbital rotation (\uf067) as:\nv \uf03d 2\uf05e r \uf0d7 \uf058 \uf03d \uf067 r\n\n12.17\n\nConsequently, we get for the ratio of tangential velocity of particle/object to its\ncentripetal acceleration:\n\uf03f\n\nv\n1 \uf03d r\n\uf03d \uf067\nv\ndv/dt\n\n12.17a\n\nPutting (12.17a and 12.17) into \uf0dd12. 14\uf0de, we get the dependence of time of action for\nCorpuscular phase of elementary particle, characterizing period of rotation of structure, like\nFig.2 (electron) or Fig.4 (photon) around internal main axes with radius of rotation (r) and\nangular frequency (\uf067 \uf03d v/ r \uf0de:\nt\uf03d\n\n2\nr 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de\nv 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n\uf03d\nW\n\n2\n1 1 \uf03f \uf0dd r \uf067/L 0 \uf067 0 \uf0de\n\uf067 2 \uf03f \uf0dd r \uf067/L \uf067 \uf0de 2\n0 0\n\n12.18\nC\n\nThe transition of elementary particles in [W] phase to [C] phase is accompanied by\nreversible of translational degrees of freedom to rotational ones.\nFor sub-elementary fermion in [C] phase, when the translational energy of elementary\n\n\f101\nparticle, pertinent for [W] phase, turns to rotational one, we have, using (12.16 and 12.17):\n\uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf03d \uf0dd r \uf067/L 0 \uf067 0 \uf0de 2\n\n12.19\n\nwhere : L 0 \uf03d \uf0a4/m 0 c and \uf067 0 \uf03d m 0 c 2 /\uf0a4\nFrom (12.18) we can see, that for nonrelativistic conditions of orbital rotation of\nsystem/object, when its tangential velocity v \uf03c\uf03c c and permanent angular frequency:\n\uf067 \uf03d v/r \uf03d const, we get from 12.18 the relation between characteristic time of this system\nand period of orbital rotation (T):\nt ext\nv\uf03c\uf03cc \uf070\n\n1\n2\uf067\n\n\uf03d 1 T\n4\uf05e\n\n12.20\n\nFor relativistic conditions of the same system, when v \uf070 c at angular velocity\n\uf0dd\uf067 \uf03d v/r\uf0de \uf03d const, we get from \uf0dd12. 18\uf0de, that characteristic time and period of orbiting\nv\uf0b8c\nelementary particle or macroscopic object is tending to zero, as far 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf0b8 0 and\nv\uf0b8c\n2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf0b8 1:\nt v\uf0c0c \uf0b8 0 and the period\n\nT \uf03d 1/\uf058\n\nand r \uf0b8 r max as far \uf067 \uf03d v\nr\n\n\uf0b8 0 at v \uf0b8 c\n\n\uf03d const\n\n12.21\n12.21a\n\nFor the case, under consideration, the increasing of radius of orbit (r) proportional to\nincreasing of velocity of orbiting particle/object at permanent angular frequency is a\nconsequence of condition (12.21a).\nFor intermediate case, when v \uf03c c, using result \uf0dd12. 20\uf0de, our formula for time \uf0dd12. 18\uf0de\ncan be presented in a shape, symmetric to conventional relativistic formula for inherent\ntime (12.15):\nt \uf03d 2t v\uf03c\uf03cc\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n12.22\n\nwhere: t ~ t v\uf03e0 (12.15) and 2t v\uf03c\uf03cc ~ t v\uf03d0 (12.15).\nWe may see, that for this intermediated case, the characteristic time in formula (12.15)\nof relativistic theory and our (12.22) is decreasing with velocity increasing in both\n\uf03f1\ndescription. However, in formula (12.22) the additional factor: 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nmakes the\ndependence of time of moving object (i.e. clock) on its velocity weaker than in (12.15).\nFormula (12.14) determines, that at very low acceleration \uf0dda \uf03d dv/dt\uf0de \uf03c\uf03c 1, the ratio\n[v/a\uf0e0 should dominate on ratio:\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\uf03c\uf03c \uf03f v\na\n2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nConsequently, at condition (12.22a) the time of action should increase with velocity of\nrotating or pulsing object. The same qualitative result follows from special relativity\n(12.15a). Consequently, at these condition the time delay in moving system, following from\nspecial relativity, is in accordance with our theory of time.\nThe formula for time (12.14), determined by internal rotational degrees of freedom of\nstationary systems, like sub-elementary fermions in elementary particles, the electron\norbiting in atom of hydrogen or any planet, rotating around the star, can be transformed to:\n\n12.22a\n\n\f102\nm \uf02bV c 2 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n1\nt\uf03d \uf067\nm \uf02bV \uf0dd2c 2 \uf03f v 2 \uf0de\n\n\uf03d\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 E tot\n\uf067\n2V\n\n12.23\n\nwhere: E tot \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d const is a total energy of rotating with angular frequency \uf067\nelementary particle with actual mass m \uf02bV , as a conservative system;\n\uf02b\n2V \uf03d 2\uf0ddE tot \uf03f T k \uf0de \uf03d m V \uf0dd2c 2 \uf03f v 2 \uf0de \uf03d \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 is a doubled potential energy of\nunpaired sub-elementary fermion of elementary particle with actual and complementary\nmass of torus and antitorus: m \uf02bV and m \uf03fV .\nIn the case of harmonic oscillation or standing wave, when E tot \uf03d V \uf02b T k \uf03d 2V and\nV \uf03d T k , the characteristic time of rotating with angular frequency \uf0dd\uf067 \uf03d v/r\uf0de particle is\ndependent only on the ratio of its absolute velocity to the light one (v/c) 2 .\n12.4 The application of new time concept for explanation of\nFermat principle\nThe Fermat principle states that light waves of a given frequency traverse the path\nbetween two points which takes the least time. Its modern form is \"A light ray, in going\nbetween two points, must follow optical path length which is stationary with respect to\nvariations of the path.\" In this formulation, the paths may be maxima, minima, or saddle\npoints.\nThe most obvious example of this is the passage of light through a homogeneous\nmedium in which the speed of light doesn't change with position. In this case shortest time\nis equivalent to the shortest distance between the points, which, as we all know, is a straight\nline. The examples are existing that time of light passage, including reflected beam, can be\nminimum or maximum like for light beams from source in the center of ellipsoid with\nmirror internal surface. There can be a number of trajectories of light beams with the same\ntime of passion. For example, it is true for different beams from one focal point to another\npassing throw the lens on different distance from lens center. The most important condition\nfor realization of Fermat principle is t \uf03d const. This principle explains the law of\nreflection, as the equality of angles of incidence and angle of reflection: \uf053 I \uf03d \uf053 R and\nSnell's law of refraction: sin \uf053 I \uf03d n sin \uf053 R .\nHowever, it is not yet clear why the Fermat principle is working. Let us analyze the\napplication of Fermat principle to light refraction, using our formula for time (12.14). In\naccordance to Fermat principle the variation of action time for photons at:\nE tot \uf03d V \uf02b T k \uf03d \uf0a4\uf067 ph \uf03d const (condition of conservative system) should be zero: \uf041t \uf03d 0.\nThe ratio of velocity of light in vacuum/bivacuum to its velocity \uf0ddv \uf0c0 c\uf0de in gas, liquid\nor transparent solid determines the refraction index of corresponding medium:\n\uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf03d 1/n. Taking this into account, the variation of (12.14) in [W] and [C] phase of\nphoton can be presented as:\n1 \uf03f \uf0dd1/n\uf0de\n\uf041t \uf03d \uf041 \uf03f v\na 2 \uf03f \uf0dd1/n\uf0de\n\n\uf03d0\n\n12.24\n\nW,C\n\nAfter differentiation (12.24), we get:\n\uf041n \uf03f 2\uf041n \uf03d \uf041a \uf03f \uf041v\nv\na\nn \uf03f 1 2n \uf03f 1\nAt the conditions, when velocity of light in medium is close to this velocity in empty\n\uf041n\n2\uf041n\nspace: n \uf03d \uf0ddc/v\uf0de 2 \uf0c1 1 we have n\uf03f1\n\uf03e\uf03e 2n\uf03f1\nand \uf0dd12. 24a\uf0de turns to:\n\n12.24a\n\n\f103\n\n\uf041n \uf072 \uf0ddn \uf03f 1\uf0de\n\n\uf03f v 2 v\uf03f1 v 1\n\n\uf02b \uf041a\na\n\nW\n\n12.24b\n\nThe relative change of acceleration \uf041a/a describes the jump of light velocity on the\ninterface between two different homogeneous medium.\nIt is easy to see from this formula, that if the light velocity in 2nd medium is lower, than\nin 1st and \uf0ddv 2 \uf03f v 1 \uf0de \uf03c 0, the refraction index will increase: \uf041n \uf03e 0. This is in total\naccordance with empirical data and explains why the Fermat principle is working in\ngeometrical optics.\nFormula (12.24b) describes the change of photon parameters it its Wave [W] phase.\nThe centripetal acceleration of photon in Corpuscular [C] phase can be expressed via\n2\ntangential velocity and rotation radius of photon structure (Fig.4) as: a cp \uf03d \uf03f v \uf03d \uf03f\uf067 2 r\nr\nand\n\uf041a \uf03d\na\n\n2\uf041\uf067 \uf02b \uf041r\nr\n\uf067\n\nC\n\nThe relative jump of tangential velocity of photon rotation in [C] phase (v tn \uf03d \uf067 r \uf0de on\nthe interphase between two mediums is:\n\uf041v \uf03d\nv\n\n\uf041\uf067 \uf02b \uf041r\nr\n\uf067\n\nC\n\nConsequently, the difference in relative increments for [C] phase of photon is:\n\uf041a \uf03f \uf041v\nv\na\n\nC\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf041\uf067\n\uf067\n\nC\n\nPutting this expression to (12.24b), we get the increment of refraction index for photon\nin Corpuscular phase via relative jump of its angular frequency:\n\uf041n \uf072 \uf0ddn \uf03f 1\uf0de \uf041\uf067\n\uf067\n\nC\n\nThis angular frequency of photon rotation coincides with frequency of its \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0\npulsation only in symmetric primordial Bivacuum. In the volume of liquids or solids the\nsymmetry of Bivacuum dipoles and their dynamics are changed by elementary particles of\nmedium. From 12.24c we get, that this should be accompanied by increasing of rotational\nfrequency of photon in its [C] phase.\nOur Unified theory, in contrast to relativistic one, considers the velocity as the absolute\nparameter, relative to translational velocity of symmetric Bivacuum dipoles equal to zero\n(see eq. 4.4). The light velocity (c) is also absolute parameter, determined by properties of\nBivacuum (ether) and independent on velocity of source of photons.\n12.5 The quantitative evidence in proof of new theory of time\nand elementary particles formation from Bivacuum dipoles\nUsing eq.

The same result we get from our\n(12.14) in nonrelativistic conditions: \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf03c\uf03c 1.\nFor the other hand, from (12.30a) it follows that increasing of (r\uf0de at permanent M\nshould increase the period of pulsation (T G \uf0de and decrease its frequency - red Doppler shift.\nThe experiment for confirmation of described above consequences of General relativity\ntheory (GR) was set up by Pound and Rebka (1959) in the Harvard tower, using M\u00f6ssbauer\neffect. The Harvard tower is just 22.6 m, so the fractional gravitational red shift between\nthe frequency \u03bd bottom of \uf04c \uf03fquantums emitted at the bottom of tower and frequency \u03bd top\nabsorbed at the top of tower predicted by GRT, similar to simple classical approach\n(12.31), is given by the formula:\n\uf041E \uf03d \uf058 bottom \uf03f \uf058 top \uf03d T top \uf03f T bottom \uf03d Gl \uf03d 2. 45 \uf0d7 10 \uf03f15\nE\n\uf058 top\nT top\nc2\nwhere: G is the gravitational constant; l \uf03d r 2 \uf03f r 1 \uf03d 22. 6 m is the tower height and c is\nthe speed of light.\nPound and Rebka used the 14.4 keV gamma ray from the iron-57 isotope that has a high\nenough resolution to detect such a small difference in energy and frequency:\n\u2206E \uf03d h\uf0dd\uf058 bottom \uf03f\uf058 top \uf0de. In other set of experiments the source of \uf04c \uf03fquantum was placed at\nthe top of tower and detector at the bottom.\nThe predicted theoretically relative frequency shifts on the upward and downward paths\nwhere opposite by sign, but the same by absolute values. Their sum: 4. 9 \uf0d7 10 \uf03f15 appears to\nbe very close to measured: 5. 1 \uf0d7 10 \uf03f15 . Consequently, as it follows from our formula for\nperiod of elementary pulsations (12.14), it is smaller in locations, where gravitational or\ncentrifugal accelerations are bigger.\n\n12.33\n\n\f107\nThe coincidence of quantitative experimental relative shifts values with theoretical\nones, following from GTR and simple classical Newton's formalism (12.31a) is excellent.\nHowever, it does not contain a strong evidence that GTR works better, than classical\nNewtonian approach.\n12.7 The explanation of Hefele-Keating experiments\nThe additional confirmation of validity of our formula for time (12.14) is its ability to\nexplain well known experiments of Hefele-Keating (1971) for verification of special and\ngeneral theories of relativity (SR and GR).\nThey flew four cesium atomic clocks around the Earth in jets, first eastbound, then\nwestbound. These experiments proved that atomic clocks period is dependent on the\ndirection, velocity and altitude of jet airplanes. The direction and velocity of the airplanes\nwhere factors of the SR and the altitude was a factor of GR.\nCompared to the time kept by control atomic clock fixed on the ground (USA), the\neastbound clocks on the jets where slower (period of oscillation bigger) and westbound\nclocks - faster (period of oscillation shorter).\nThe velocity of eastbound clocks are the sum of tangential velocity of jet and tangential\nvelocity of atmosphere at the altitude of jet flight: v east\nres \uf03d v jet  \u0301 \uf02b v at . For the other hand, the\nresulting velocity of westbound clock is a difference of these velocities: v west \uf03d v jet  \u0301 \uf03f v at .\nThe correct position of reference clock (non rotating) should be at the axes of the earth\nrotation (i.e. poles) of the earth. The velocity of the earth orbiting around the Sun and Sun\nsystem velocity in the universe was not taken into account.\nWebster Kehr (2002) in his book \"The detection of Ether\" points out, that in original\nversion of special relativity (1905) each of jets flying with permanent velocity should be\nconsidered as the rest reference frames.\nHowever, even in such approximate approach, where the local reference frames instead\nUniversal reference frame (URF) was used, Hafele and Keating found out, that the time\neffects, calculated using relativity theory, coincide well with experimental ones.\nWe will show below, that these experiments can be explained also on the base of our\ntheory of time and simple Newtonian formula for gravitation and free fall acceleration, as a\npart of Unified theory.\nThe free fall acceleration following from Newton formula (12.32 and 12.32a) is:\na G \uf03d \uf0dddv/dt\uf0de G \uf03d G M2 \uf03d g\nr\n\n12.34\n\nFormula (12.14) can be presented in form, interrelating characteristic time of object\nwith gravitational free fall acceleration (a G \uf03d g\uf0de, velocity of object and the increments of\nthese parameters at permanent velocity:\nT ext\n4\uf05e\nor :\n\nv\uf03c\uf03cc\n\n\uf070\n\next\n\nt \uf03d\n\n1 \uf041T ext\n4\uf05e\n\nv r 2 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nGM 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nv\uf03c\uf03cc\n1 \uf0dd2v r\uf041r \uf02b r 2 \uf041v\uf0de\n\uf070\n2GM\nv\uf03dconst\n\nwhere: T \uf03d 2\uf05e/\uf067 is the period of elementary oscillation in external reference frame\n(atomic clock in private case).\nFormula (12.35) interrelate our concept of time with gravitation, however, in different\nway, than general theory of relativity.\nAt permanent tangential velocity of jets respectively to the Earth surface: v \uf03d const,\n\uf041v \uf03d 0 for nonrelativistic case: v \uf03c\uf03c c we get from (12.35a) the confirmation of (12.33),\nthat the external period is increasing and frequency decreasing with distance from the earth\n\n12.35\n12.35a\n\n\f108\ncenter:\n\uf0df\uf041T \uf03d \uf03f\uf041\uf058\uf0e0 ext\nv\uf03dconst\n\nv\uf03c\uf03cc\n\n\uf070\n\n4\uf05e\n\nv r\uf041r\n\uf041r\n\uf03d 4\uf05e v\ng r\nGM\n\n12.36\n\nwhere: \uf041r \uf03d r 2 \uf03f r 1 in private case corresponds to l in eq.(12.33).\nFor the other case of permanent distance to the Earth center and surface: r \uf03d const;\n\uf041r \uf03d 0 and (12.35a) turns to:\n\uf0df\uf041T \uf03d \uf03f\uf041\uf058\uf0e0 r\uf03dconst\n\nv\uf03c\uf03cc\n\n\uf070\n\n2\n2\uf05e r \uf041v \uf03d 2\uf05e \uf041v\ng\nGM\n\n12.37\n\nwhere: G \uf03d6. 67259 \uf0d7 10 \uf03f11 m 3 kg \uf03f1 s \uf03f2 ; M \uf03d5. 9742 \uf0d7 10 24 kg is the earth mass;\nr \uf03d 6. 378164 \uf0d7 10 6 m is the equatorial radius of the Earth; g \uf03d GM/r 2 \uf03d 9. 8 m/s 2 free\nfall acceleration.\nFrom this formula we can see, that as far velocity of eastbound clocks are the sum of\ntangential velocity of jet and tangential velocity of atmosphere at the altitude of jet flight:\nv east\nres \uf03d v jet  \u0301 \uf02b v at , the period of atomic clock should increase - time is slowing down. For\nthe westbound clock the decreasing of actual velocity of clock: v west \uf03d v jet  \u0301 \uf03f v at should\ndecrease the period of atomic clock and they show 'faster' time. These consequences are in\ntotal accordance with experiment of Hafele-Keating (1971).\n12.8 Interrelation between period of the Earth rotation, its radius,\nfree fall acceleration and tangential velocity\nIf we take the local reference frame, as a center of Earth, where the tangential velocity\nis zero (v tn \uf03d 0; \uf041v tn \uf03d 0\uf0de, then the time and frequency increments should be also zero , as\nit follows from both formulas (12.36 and 12.37): \uf0df\uf041T \uf03d \uf03f\uf041\uf058\uf0e0 v\uf03d0; r\uf03d0 \uf03d 0\nThe tangential velocity of the point on the Earth surface rotation is:\nv tn\nEarth \uf03d 2\uf05er/T Earth \uf03d\n\n7\n6. 28 \uf0d7 6. 378164 \uf0d7 10 6 m\n\uf03d 4. 0 \uf0d7 10 5 \uf03d 4. 63 \uf0d7 10 2 m/s\n0. 864 \uf0d7 10\n24 \uf0d7 60 \uf0d7 60 s\n\n12.38\n\nwhere: T Earth \uf03d 24 h \uf03d 8. 64 \uf0d7 10 4 s is the period of the Earth rotation.\nWe may assume, that the atmosphere of the Earth has the same tangential velocity, i.e.\nrotate with Earth.\nThe velocity of jet as respect to this rotating atmosphere is about\nv jet \uf03d 700km/h \uf03d 2 \uf0d7 10 2 m/s.\nPutting value (12.38) and others in (12.36) and assuming (\uf041r/r\uf0de \uf03d 1, we get for\ncorresponding increment of period, corresponding to change of the radius of rotation from\nzero to the earth radius:\ncal\n4. 63 \uf0d7 10 2 \uf03d 5. 93 \uf0d7 10 3 s\n\uf041r\nT Earth ~ \uf0df\uf041T\uf0e0 r\uf03dconst \uf03d 4\uf05e v\ng r \uf03d 12. 56\n9. 8\n\n12.39\n\nThis calculated value is about 15 times less, than real period of the Earth rotation:\ncal\nT Earth /T Earth \uf070 15. This discrepancy may be a result of following factors:\n1) The opposite direction of rotation of the inner volumes of the earth, for example its\nnuclear, as respect to its surface core, keeping the resulting angular momentum equal to\nzero:\nM ext v ext r ext \uf02b M in v in r in \uf03d 0\nwhere M ext ; v ext ; and \uf041r ext are the averaged mass, velocity and effective radius of\n\n12.40\n\n\f109\ncorresponding regions of the earth, rotation in opposite direction.\nThis factor may strongly increase the effective tangential velocity of the earth surface\n(v) as respect to axis of its rotation in (12.39).\n2) nonlinear dependence of (g) on the distance from center of the Earth in the internal\nregion of planet, i.e. g \uf03d f\uf0dd\uf041r/r\uf0de;\n3) contribution to (v) in (12.39) the Earth velocity motion on the orbit around Sun\n\uf0dd30 \uf0d7 10 3 m/s) and Solar system in the Universe \uf0dd370 \uf0d7 10 3 m/s);\n4) slowing down the frequency of the Earth rotation with time (billions of years) due to\ndifferent kind of energy dissipation, like interaction with moon, etc.\nFormula \uf0dd12. 36\uf0de points to qualitatively similar time effects, as general relativity and\nour formula (12.37) to the same effects, as special relativity when v \uf03c\uf03c c.\nConsequently, our Unified theory, including new approach to time problem and\naccepting simple Newtonian formula for gravitational force, can explain all most important\nexperiments, which where used for confirmation of special and general relativity.\nThe time in our approach is a characteristic parameter of any closed system (classical\nand quantum) dynamics, involving not only velocity but also acceleration. In contrast to\ntime definition, following from special relativity (12.15), the time in our Unified theory is\ninfinitive and independent on velocity in any inertial system of particles, when \uf0dddv/dt\uf0de \uf03d 0.\nHowever, at any nonzero acceleration (dv/dt) \uf03d const \uf03e 0 the time is dependent on\nvelocity of these objects in more complex manner, than it follows from special relativity.\nIn fact, there are no physical systems in our expanding with acceleration Universe, formed\nby rotating galactics and stabilized by gravitational field, which can be considered, as\nperfectly inertial, i.e. where the acceleration is absent totally. This means, that\nconventional relativistic formula for time (12.15) is not applicable for real physical systems\nin general case.\n13. The Virtual Replica (VR) of Material Objects and its Multiplication (VRM)\nTheory of Virtual Replica (VR) of material objects in Bivacuum and VR Multiplication\nin space and time: VRM(r,t) is proposed. The primary VR 0 in initial time represents a\nthree-dimensional (3D) superposition of Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPW \uf0b1m and\nVirSW \uf0b11/2\nm , modulated by \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of elementary particles and translational and\nlibrational de Broglie waves of molecules of macroscopic object\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027).\nFor the end of energy, charge and spin conservation in Bivacuum, we have to assume,\nthat symmetry shifts of Bivacuum dipoles, involved in VR formation, should compensate\neach other.

In accordance to our theory,\nthis means also the coherent [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsations of elementary particles of these molecules\nand atoms. The violation of this coherency is accompanied by density fluctuation and\ndefects origination or cavitational fluctuations in solids and liquids.\nThe surface macroscopic virtual replica of the object: VR sur \uf03d \uf03e VR sur\nmic is a part of the\nEther body. The mechanism of its origination is similar to internal macroscopic virtual\nreplica of the object VR in \uf03d \uf03e VR in\nmic . It is a result of modulation of Bivacuum virtual\nwaves by de Broglie waves of elementary particles of the atoms and molecules on the\nsurface of the object. Its dimension can exceed the dimensions of the object.\nThe superposition of the internal and surface virtual replicas corresponds to notion of\nthe \"ether body\" in Eastern philosophy:\nEther Body \uf0af VR \uf03d VR in \uf02b VR sur \uf03d\n\n\uf03e\uf0ddVR inmic \uf02b VR sur\nmic \uf0de\n\nStability of hierarchic system of whirls, forming Ether Body, as a hierarchical system of\nvirtual standing waves and curls in superfluid Bivacuum (like permanent circular currents\nand whirls in superfluid 4 He), could be responsible for so-called \"phantom effect\" of this\nobject.\n\n13.15\n\n\f115\n13.4 The infinitive spatial Virtual Replica Multiplication VPM(r).\nThe \"Astral\" and \"Mental\" bodies, as a distant and nonlocal components of VRM(r)\nThe mechanism of primary Virtual Replica Multiplication \uf0ddVPM) have general features\nwith hologram origination, however without photomaterials or screens, fixing VR. The role\nof coherent reference waves play unperturbed by the object basic Bivacuum virtual waves\n(VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 and nonlocal VirSW \uf0b11/2\nq\uf03d1 \uf0de. The role of subject waves is represented by the\nprimary Virtual Replica of the object, containing information not only on shape/surface, but\nalso about internal properties of the subject.\nThe VRM is a spatially isotropic process, like excitation of spherical waves. It can be\nsubdivided on two components - distant (translational) and nonlocal (rotational or\nlibrational):\n1) the distant component of VRM(r) dis is a result of replication of the translational\ncomponent of primary VR outside the volume of the object, by means of Virtual Pressure\nWaves (VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de. The front of 3D VRM dis in form of huge number of secondary VR\nisotropicaly expand in space like gravitation waves with light velocity\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027).\nThe virtual replica of the object can be reproducible in form of distant VRM dis (like the\nhologram) in any remote space regions, where the interference pattern of the reference\nwave VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 with primary VR as the object wave, is existing. The volume of space,\noccupied by distant VRM dis , is expanding with light velocity (c) during the life-time of\nprimary VR and atoms, composing the object.\nThe expanding with light velocity population of VR\uf0ddct\uf0de, spatially separated from the\nbody/object, may correspond to Eastern ancient notion of the \"astral body\":\nt\n\nAstral Body \uf03d\n\n\uf03e VR tr \uf0ddct\uf0de \uf03d VRM dis\nt\n\nAs far each individual secondary VR in population \uf03e VR\uf0ddct\uf0de in the absence of\ndissipation in superfluid Bivacuum is the exact copy of the primary VR, they should be\nspatially also indistinguishable, like particles in state of Bose condensate. The detected by\npsychic or by special device secondary replica displays its properties\nThe dielectric permittivity (\uf050 0 \uf0de and permeability (\uf057 0 \uf0de in the volume of the Astral bodies\nmay differ from their averaged values in Bivacuum because of small charge symmetry shift\nin Bivacuum fermions (BVF \uf0bb ): \uf041e \uf03d |e \uf02b \uf03f e \uf03f | \uf03e 0, induced by recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil effects,\naccompanied \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of elementary particles. Consequently, the probability of\natoms and molecules excitation and ionization (dependent on Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons and nuclears), as a result of their thermal collisions with excessive kinetic energy,\nmay be higher in volumes of the Astral bodies, than outside of them. This may explain their\nspecial optical effects - a shining of some objects phantoms (ghosts) in darkness, or their\nspecific spectrogram, representing astral bodies. Their spatial instability of phantoms can\nbe explained by spatial similarity of astral bodies, composing VRM dis . The possibility of\nphenomena like remote vision and remote healing also follow from our holomovement like\nmechanism of VRM\uf0ddr\uf0de S \uf039 VRM\uf0ddr\uf0de R superposition of Sender and Receiver and their\n'tuning'.\nThe sensitivity of Kirlian effect or Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) to internal\nprocess of macroscopic object, like human body, also can be explained by specific\nproperties of the surface Ether and Astral bodies, changing the probability of the air\nmolecules excitation/ionization after thermal collision;\n2) the nonlocal component of VRM nl is a result of 3D replication of the\n\n13.16\n\n\f116\nrotational/librational component of primary virtual replica (VR lb \uf0de outside the volume of the\nobject, by means of nonlocal (informational) Virtual Spin Waves (VirSW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de, propagating\nin symmetric Bivacuum instantly, i.e. without light velocity limitation.\nThe nonlocal macroscopic virtual replica multiplication (VRM nl ) or VR iteration, is a\nresult of interference of modulated by librational de Broglie waves the recoil \uf0f0 antirecoil\neffects the Bivacuum virtual spin waves: VirSW \uf0b11/2\nm \uf03f object spin waves with\ncorresponding reference spin waves of Bivacuum (VirSW \uf0b11/2\nq \uf0de.\nThe Eastern notion of mental body may correspond to VRM nl , as a multiplication\n(holoiteration or holomovement after Bohm) of informational Virtual Replicas \uf0dfVR lb \uf0e0:\nt\n\nMental Body \uf03d\n\n\uf03e VR lb \uf03d VRM nl\n\nHierarchical superposition of huge number of Astral and Mental Bodies of all human\npopulation on the Earth can be responsible for Global Informational Field origination, like\nNoosphere, proposed by Russian scientist Vernadsky in the beginning of 20th century. The\nAstral and Mental bodies may partly be overlapped with Ether body. This provide the\npossibility of dynamic exchange interaction and feedback reaction between all three virtual\nbodies of the object: Ether, Astral and Mental.\nOne important conjecture, following from our approach to distant VRM dis can be\ndiscussed. We proceed from the consequence of our theory, that the volume of space,\noccupied by distant VRM dis is expanding isotropicaly with light velocity (c) in 3D space\nduring the life-time of VR and atoms, composing the object.\nThe life span of the individual stable atoms, including hydrogen, carbons, oxygen,\ncomposing biological objects is comparable with life-time of the Universe, i.e. over ten\nbillions of years. This means, that not only nonlocal VRM nl, , but as well the distant\nVRM dis of these atoms may involve all the Universe. It is a conditions of Virtual Guides of\nspin, momentum and energy (VirG SME \uf0de 3D net formation in the Universe, connecting\nvirtually all similar and coherent elementary particles and atoms of the equal de Broglie\nwave length. We suppose, however, that only in composition of biosystems these atoms\nmay become enough coherent and orchestrated to provide a strong enough cumulative\ninteraction between Sender and Receiver, for example, between psychic and very remote\nobjects (inorganic or biological) via 3D net of VirG SME and VRM as a factors of Bivacuum\nmediated interaction (BMI). The construction of VirG SME and mechanism of their action\nwill be described in the next section.\nA complex Hierarchical system \uf03e VRM\uf0ddr, t\uf0de of Solar system, galactics, including\nNoosphere, may be considered as Hierarchical quantum supercomputer or\nSuperconsciousness, able to simulate all probable situations of virtual future and past. It is\npossible in conditions of time uncertainty: t \uf03d 0/0 when the translational velocity v \uf03d 0\nand accelerations \uf0dddv/dt\uf0de \uf03d 0 in the volume of \uf03e VRM\uf0ddr, t\uf0de are zero (Kaivarainen, 2005:\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0103031 ).\nOur theory admit a possibility of feedback reaction between the iterated VR and\nprimary one and between primary VR and the object physical properties. Consequently, the\nphenomena of most probable event anticipation by enough sensitive physical detectors and\nhuman beings (psychics) is possible in principle. This may explain the reproducible results\nof unconsciousness response (by changes of human skin conductance) of future events\n(presponse), obtained by Dick Bierman and Dean Radin (2002). However, in these\nexperiments the possibility of influence of intention of participant on random events\ngenerator (REG), choosing next photo (calm or emotional), like in Bierman's experiments,\nalso should be taken into account. Such kind of weak influence of humans intention on\n\n13.17\n\n\f117\nREG was demonstrated in long term studies of Danne and Jahn (2003).\nIn contrast to virtual time, the reversibility of real time looks impossible, as far it needs\nthe reversibility of all dynamic process in Universe due to interrelations between closed\nsystems of different levels of hierarchy. It is evident that such 'play back' of the Universe\nhistory needs the immense amount of energy redistribution in the Universe.\nAll three described Virtual Replicas: Ether, Astral and Mental bodies are interrelated\nwith each other and physical body. The experimental evidences are existing, that between\nproperties of the Ether bodies and corresponding physical bodies of living organisms or\ninorganic matter, the correlation takes a place. It is confirmed by the Kirlian effect,\nreflecting the ionization/excitation threshold of the air molecules in volume of Ether and\nastral bodies.\nThe perturbation of the Ether body of one object (Receptor) by the astral or mental\nbody of the other object (Sender) can be imprinted in properties of physical body\n(condensed matter) of Receptor for a long time in form of subtle, but stable structural\nperturbations. The stability of such kind of informational 'taping' is determined by specific\nproperties of material, as a matrix for imprinting. For example, water and aqueous systems,\nlike biological ones, are very good for stable imprinting of virtual information and energy\nvia introduced VRM and Virtual Guides (see next chapter). However, some 'sensitive'\nstones or other rigid materials have a much longer life span.\nThe Ghost phenomena can be explained by reproducing of such imprinted in walls,\ncells and floor information, mediated by distant virtual replica multiplication (VRM dis ). The\nreproduction of VR from imprinted in condensed matter VRM dis is a process, similar to\ntreatment of regular hologram by the reference waves. In the case of 'Ghost' the reference\nwaves can be presented by basic VPW \uf0b1m and VirSW \uf0b11/2\nm , modulated by special superposition\nof Virtual replicas of other objects, for example, Earth, Moon and Sun.\nThe nonlocal Mental - Informational body formation in living organisms and humans,\nin accordance to our theory (Kaivarainen, 2001; 2003), is related to equilibrium shift of\ndynamic equilibrium of [assembly \uf0f0 disassembly] of coherent water clusters in\nmicrotubules of the neurons (librational effectons), accompanied series of elementary acts\nof consciousness in nonequilibrium processes of meditation, intention and braining.\nCorresponding variations of kinetic energy and momentum of water molecules can be\ntransmitted from Sender to remote Receiver via nonlocal virtual spin-momentum-energy\nguides VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de, described in next chapter.\nIn complex process of Psi phenomena, the first stage is a 'target searching' by nonlocal\n[mental body] of psychic, then formation of VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de i , then activation of\npsychic's [astral body] by its [ether body]. The latter can be interrelated with specific\nprocesses of physical body of psychic, like dynamics of water in microtubules of neurons\nensembles, realizing elementary acts of perception and consciousness, in accordance to our\nmodel (Kaivarainen, 2000; 2005).\nThe possible mechanism of entanglement between microscopic and macroscopic\nobjects, based on our Unified theory, will be described in Chapters 14 and 15.\n13.5 Contributions of different kind of internal dynamics of matter\nto Virtual Replica of the object\nFor each of 24 selected collective excitation of condensed matter, considered in our\nHierarchic theory of matter (Kaivarainen, 2000a), the averaged thermal vibrations\ncontribution to VR of the object can be evaluated, using special computer program, named\nComprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties - CAMP.\nThe most effective source of coherent Virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf0b1 \uf0de amplitude\noscillations are the [disassembly \uf0f0 assembly] of coherent clusters, existing in liquids\n(librational primary effectons) and solids (librational and translational primary effectons).\n\n\f118\nSuch clusters are the result of the ambient temperature mesoscopic Bose condensation\n(mBC) and may contain from tens (in liquids) to thousands (in solids) of coherent\nmolecules. Primary convertons - transition states between primary librational and\ntranslational effectons in liquids represents assembly - disassembly of clusters. These\nprocesses are accompanied by oscillation of molecular de Broglie waves length and\nfrequency, modulating the carrying frequency of Bivacuum virtual pressure waves\n(VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de. In accordance to described in section (15.1) mechanism, such kind of\nmodulation follows by formation of hologram-like Virtual Replica of the object. Other\nkinds of collective excitations in condensed matter are not so coherent (Kaivarainen, 2001;\n2003) and corresponding VR components are not stable. This means that variation of mBC\nfraction in the object influence on the life-time of its virtual replica.\neff\nThe internal kinetic energy of collective excitations: primary effectons (T kin \uf0de, transitons\n(T tkin \uf0de and convertons (T con\nkin \uf0de vary, as a result of temperature change or more strongly as a\nresult of nonequilibrium cooperative process, like melting. The values of these\ncontributions and their changes may be calculated using Hierarchic theory of condensed\nmatter, based on CAMP computer program (Kaivarainen, 2000a). The translational\ndynamics dynamics turns the basic virtual Pressure Waves \uf0ddVPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de to modulated ones\nand librational dynamics modulate the basic virtual spin waves \uf0ddVirSW \uf0b11/2\nq\uf03d1 ), as was\ndemonstrated in previous section:\neff\n\nt\n2\uf041\uf0ddT tot\nkin \uf0de \uf03d 2\uf041\uf0df T kin \uf02b T kin\n\n\uf03d \uf041 V0 2\nZ\n\n\uf03e\ntr,lb\n\ntr,lb\n\nn ef\n\n\uf02b T con\nkin \uf0e0 \uf03d\n\n13.18\n\n\uf03e\uf0ddE a \uf0de 21,2,3\n2M ef \uf0ddv aph \uf0de\n2\n\n\uf0ddP aef\n2\n\neff\n\n\uf02b\n\nP bef \uf0de\n2\n\n\uf02b\n\nnt\n\n\uf03e\uf0ddE t \uf0de 21,2,3\nres\n2M t \uf0ddv s \uf0de 2\n\nE cMd\n\n2\n\nt\n\nPd\n\n13.18a\n\ncon\n\nE ac\nE bc\nn con\nP ac \uf02b\nP bc \uf02b\nres\nres\nZ 6M \uf0ddv res\n2\n6M c \uf0ddv s \uf0de 2\n6M c \uf0ddv s \uf0de 2\nc s \uf0de\n\n13.18b\n\n\uf02b\n\uf03f\n~ \uf0dfVPW \uf02bm \uf02b VPW \uf03fm \uf0e0 tr \uf02b \uf0dfVirSW \uf02b1/2\n\uf02b VirSW \uf03f1/2\nm\nm \uf0e0 lb ~ \uf0dfVirP \uf02bVirP \uf0e0 tr,lb\n\n13.18c\n\n\uf02b\uf041\n\nV0\n\nwhere: V 0 molar volume of water; Z partition function; n ef concentration of primary\neffectons; E a energy of the (a) state of the effectons; P aef and P bef probabilities of (a) and (b)\nstates of the effectons; M ef , M t and M c are the masses of primary effectons, transitons and\nconvertons; v aph is phase velocity of the effecton in a- state; n t and E t are concentration and\nenergy of transitons; n con is concentration of convertons; E ac and E bc and E cMd are the\nenergies of (a), (b) [lb/tr] convertons and macroconvertons, correspondingly.\nFor more detailed description of these parameters see paper: Hierarchic Theory of\nCondensed Matter and its Computerized Application to Water and Ice, available on-line:\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0102086.\n14 Possible Mechanism of entanglement between remote\nelementary particles via Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy (VirG iS,M,E \uf0de\nThe instant entanglement between two or more remote similar elementary particles\n(electrons, protons, neutrons, photons), named [Sender (S)] and [Receiver (R)], revealed in\na lot of experiments, started by Aspect and Grangier (1983).

In accordance with our model, the dissipation and\nviscosity friction (see section 11.6 in ) arise in the normal component of He II due to\nthermal phonons radiated and absorbed in the course of the b\uf023 \uf0b8 \u0101 and \u0101 \uf0b8 b\uf023 transitions of\nsecondary effectons, correspondingly.\n\nFig. 13.

The edge length of the corresponding cubic volume is:\nl\uf03d\n\nV 4 He\n\n1/3\n\n\uf03d 3. 58 \u00c5\n\n14.22\n\nFrom (14.21) and (14.22) we can calculate the number of 4 He atoms in the volume of\nprimary librational (rotational) effecton at \uf056-point:\nn 0V \uf03d\n\nV ef\n\uf0dd9/4\uf05e\uf0de\uf056 0\n\uf03d\n\uf03d 43 atoms\nV 4 He\nl3\n\n14.23\n\nOne edge of such an effecton of cube shape contains: q \uf03d \uf0dd43\uf0de 1/3 \uf072 3. 5 atoms of liquid\n4\nHe.\nWe must take into account, that these parameters can be lower than the real ones, as far\nin above simple calculations we did not consider the contributions of secondary effectons,\ntransitons and deformons to total internal energy (Kaivarainen, 2001).\nOn the other hand, in accordance with Hierarchic model, the conditions of the\nmaximum stability of primary effectons correspond to the integer number of particles in the\nedge of these effectons (Kaivarainen, 2001).\nConsequently, we have to assume that the true number of 4 He atoms forming a primary\neffecton at \uf056-point is equal to n 0V \uf03d 64. It means that the edge of cube as the effecton shape\napproximation contains q 0 \uf03d 4 atoms of 4 He:\nq 0 \uf03d \uf0ddn 0V \uf0de 1/3 \uf03d 64 1/3 \uf03d 4\n\n14.24\n\nThe primary librational effectons of such a type may correspond to rotons introduced by\nLandau to explain the high heat capacity of HeII.\nThe thermal momentums of 4 He atoms in these coherent clusters can totally\ncompensate each other and the resulting momentum of primary effectons is equal to zero.\nFurther decline in temperature gives rise to dimensions of primary effectons, representing\nmesoscopic Bose condensate (mBC). The most stable of them contain in their ribs the\ninteger number of helium atoms:\nq \uf03d q0 \uf02b n\n\n14.25\n\nwhere: q 0 \uf03d 4 and n \uf03d 1, 2, 3\uf075\n\uf056 0 , n 0V and n 0e can be calculated more accurately, using our computer program, based\non Hierarchic theory, if the required experimental data on IR spectroscopy and sound\nvelocimetry are available.\nLet us consider now the consequence of the phenomena observed in 4 He in the course\nof temperature decline to explain Fig. 13 in the framework of hierarchic model:\n1. In accordance to our model, the lowering of the temperature till the 4.2 K and\ngas-liquid first order phase transition occurs under condition, when the most probable wave\nB length of atoms related to their librations/rotations starts to exceed the average distance\nbetween 4 He atoms in a liquid phase and mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC) in form of\ncoherent atomic clusters becomes possible:\n\uf056 \uf03d h/mv gr \uf0b3 3. 58\u00c5\nThe corresponding value of the most probable group velocity is\n\n14.26\n\n\f128\n\nv gr \uf0b2 3. 2 \uf036 10 4 cm/s.\nThe translational thermal momentums of particles are usually bigger and waves B length\nsmaller than those related to librations. In accordance with our model of first order phase\ntransitions (Kaivarainen, 2001, section 6.2), this fact determines the difference in the\ntemperatures of [gas \uf0b8 liquid] and [liquid \uf0b8 solid] transitions.\nThe freezing of liquid 4 He occurs at a sufficiently high pressure of \uf069 25 atm. only and\nmeans the emergency of primary translational effectons in accordance to our theory of 1st\norder phase transitions (Kaivarainen, 2001). The pressure increasing, as well as temperature\ndecreasing, decline the translational thermal momentum of particles and stimulates Bose\ncondensation, responsible for coherent clusters formation of corresponding type.\nIn normal component of liquid 4 HeII, like in a usual liquid at T \uf03e 0 K, the existence of\nprimary and secondary effectons, convertons, transitons and deformons is possible. The\ncontributions of each of these quasiparticles determine the total internal energy, kinetic and\npotential energies, viscosity, thermal conductivity, vapor pressure and many other\nparameters (Kaivarainen, 2001).\nWe assume that the lower branch in the excitation spectrum of Fig. 13 reflects the\nacoustic (a) state and the upper branch the optic (b) state of primary (lb and tr) effectons.\n2. Decreasing the temperature to \uf056-point: T \uf056 \uf03d 2. 17K is accompanied by condition\n(14.24), which stimulates Bose-condensation of atoms, increasing the dimensions of\nprimary effectons. This leads to emergency of primary polyeffectons as superfluid\nsubsystem due to distant Van der Waals interactions and Josephson junctions between\nneighboring primary effectons. This second order phase transition is accompanied by\n(a)-states probability increasing \uf0ddP a \uf0b8 1\uf0de and that of (b)-states decreasing \uf0ddP b \uf0b8 0\uf0de. The\nprobability of primary and secondary deformons \uf0ddP d \uf03d P a \uf036 P b ; P\uf023 d \uf03d P\uf023 a \uf036 P\uf023 b \uf0de decreases\ncorrespondingly. In the excitation spectrum (Fig.1) these processes are displayed as a\ntending of (b)-branch closer to (a)-branch, as a consequence of degeneration of b-branch at\nvery law temperature.\nLike in the theory of 2nd order phase transitions proposed by Landau (Landau and\nLifshits, 1976), we can introduce here the order parameter as:\n\uf052 \uf03d 1 \uf03f \uf055 \uf03d 1 \uf03f Pa \uf03f Pb\nPa \uf02b Pb\nb\nis an equilibrium parameter.\nwhere: \uf055 \uf03d PP aa \uf03fP\n\uf02bP b\nOne can see that at P a \uf03d P b , the equilibrium parameter \uf055 \uf03d 0 and \uf052 \uf03d 1 \uf0ddthe system is\nfar from 2nd order phase transition). On the other hand, at conditions of phase transition:\nT \uf0b8 T \uf056 when P b \uf0b8 0, \uf055 \uf0b8 1 and parameter of order tends to zero \uf0dd\uf052 \uf0b8 0\uf0de.\nSimilar to Landau's theory, the equality of specific parameter of order to zero, is a\ncriteria of 2nd order phase transition. As usual, this transition is followed by a decrease in\nstructural symmetry with a decline in temperature.\nThe important point of our scenario of superfluidity is a statement that the leftward shift\nof \uf0dda \uf0f9 b\uf0de equilibrium of the primary effectons (tr and lb) becomes stable starting from\nT \uf056 due to their polymerization \"side by side\". This process of macroscopic\nBose-condensation in real quantum liquids, including conversion of secondary effectons to\nprimary ones, differs from condensation of an ideal Bose-gas. Such kind of\nBose-condensation means the enhancement of the concentration of primary effectons in (a)\nstate with lower energy, accompanied by degeneration of the all other kind of collective\nexcitations. The polymerization of primary effectons in He II gives rise to macroscopically\nlong filament-like polyeffectons.\n\n14.27\n\n\f129\nSuch process can be considered as self-organization on macroscopic scale. These\nfilament-like polyeffectons, standing for superfluid component in quantum, can form closed\ncircles or three-dimensional (3D) isotropic networks in a vessel with He II. The remnant\nfraction of liquid represent normal fraction of He II.\n14.5 The vortical filaments in superfluids as the analogs of virtual guides of Bivacuum\nPolyeffectons are characterized by the dynamic equilibrium:\nassembly \uf0f9 disassembly . Temperature decreasing and pressure increasing shift this\nequilibrium to the left, increasing the surface of the primary effectons side-by-side\ninteraction and number of Josephson junctions. The probability of tunneling between\ncoherent clusters increases also correspondingly.\nThe relative movement (sliding) of flexible \"snake-like\" polyeffectons occurs without\nphonons excitation in the volumes of IR deformons, equal to that of macrodeformons. Just\nmacrodeformons excitation is responsible for dissipation and viscosity in normal liquids\n(Kaivarainen, 2001; 2006). The absence of macrodeformons excitation, making it possible\nthe polyeffectons emergency (macroscopic Bose condensation), explains the absence of\ndissipation and superfluidity phenomenon according to our model.\nBreaking of symmetry in a three-dimensional polyeffectons network and its violation\ncan be induced by external fields, like the gravitational gradient, mechanical perturbation\nand surface effects. It is possible because coherent polyeffecton system is highly\ncooperative and unstable.\nIn rotating cylindrical vessel, the colinear filament-like polyeffectons originate from 3D\nisotropic net of polyeffectons and they tend to be oriented along the cylinder axis with their\nown rotation round their own axis in the direction opposite to that of cylinder rotation, as a\nconsequence of angular momentum conservation. In accordance with our model, this\nphenomenon represents the vortex filaments in He II, discussed above. The radius of the\nfilaments (42) is determined by the group velocity of the coherent 4 He atoms, which form\npart of the primary effectons\uf0ddv gr \uf03d v sf \uf0de. The numerical value of v gr must be equal to or less\nthan 6 \uf036 10 3 cm/s, this corresponding to conditions (14.23 and 14.24). At T \uf0b8 0, v gr\ndecreases, providing the filament radius (14.11) increasing. Finally most probable velocity\n0\ndeclines to the values corresponding to v min\ngr \uf03d v determined by zero-point oscillations of\n4\nHe atoms. Under these conditions the aggregation or polymerization of translational\nprimary effectons in (a)-state can occur, following by liquid-solid phase transition in 4 He.\nThe self-organization of highly cooperative coherent polyeffectons in \uf056-point and\nstrong (a \uf0f0 b\uf0de equilibrium leftward shift should be accompanied by a heat capacity jump.\nThe mechanism, leading to stabilization of (a)- state of primary effectons as the first\nstage of their polymerization, is a formation of coherent superclusters from primary\neffectons. Stabilization of (a) states in superclusters or bundles of vortical superfluid\nfilaments could be resulted from macroscopic self-organization of matter, turning\nmesoscopic Bose condensation to macroscopic one. Corresponding process stabilize the\nacoustic (a) state of primary effectons and destabilize the optic (b) state.\nThe successive mechanisms of super-clusterization of primary effectons and\npolymerization of these superclusters could be responsible for second order phase\ntransitions, leading to emergency of superfluidity and superconductivity.\nThe second sound in such a model can be attributed to phase velocity in a system of\npolyeffectons or superclusters. The propagation of the second sound through chain\npolyeffectons or superclusters should be accompanied by their elastic deformation and\n[assembly \uf0f9 disassembly] equilibrium oscillations.\nThe third sound can be also related to the elastic deformation of polyeffectons and\nequilibrium constant oscillations of superclusters, however only in the surface layers with\n\n\f130\nproperties different from those in bulk volume. In accordance with hierarchic theory of\nsurface tension for regular liquids (Kaivarainen, 2001), such a difference between surface\nand volume parameters is responsible for surface tension \uf0dd\uf061\uf0de in quantum liquid, like HeII,\nand its increasing at \uf056-point. Such enhancement of \uf061 explains disappearance of cavitational\nbubbles at T \uf03c T \uf056 .\nThe fourth sound is a consequence of primary effectons volume increasing and the\nchange in their phase velocity as a result of He II interaction with narrow capillary's walls\nand their thermal movement stabilization.\nThe normal component of He II is related to the fraction of He II atoms, not involved in\npolyeffectons formation. This fraction composes individual primary and secondary\neffectons, maintaining the ability for \uf0dda \uf0f9 b\uf0de and \uf0dd\u0101 \uf0f9 b\uf023 \uf0de transitions. In accordance with\nour hierarchic model, these transitions in composition of macroeffectons and\nmacrodeformons are accompanied by the emission and absorption of heat phonons.\nThe manifestation of viscous properties in normal liquid and normal component of He\nII is related to fluctuations of macrodeformons \uf0ddV M\nD \uf0de, accompanied by dissipation\n(Kaivarainen, 2001).\nOn the other hand, macro- and superdeformons are absent in the superfluid component,\nas far in primary polyeffectons at T \uf03c T \uf056 : the probability of B-state of macroeffectons:\nP B \uf03d P b \uf036 P\uf023 b \uf0b8 0; the probability of A-state of the macroeffectons: P A \uf03d P a \uf036 P\uf023 a \uf0b8 1 and,\nconsequently, the probability of macrodeformons tends to zero: P M\nD \uf03d P B \uf036 P A \uf0b8 0.\nS\nM\nM\nDecreasing the probability of superdeformons P D \uf03d \uf0ddP D \uf0de tr \uf036 \uf0ddP D \uf0de lb \uf0b8 0 means the\ndecreased concentration of cavitational bubbles and vapor pressure.\n3. We can explain the decrease in E(k) in Fig. 13 around T \uf03d T \uf056 by reducing the\ncontributions of (b) state of the primary effectons, due to their Bose-condensation,\ndecreasing the fraction of secondary effectons and concomitant elimination of the\ncontribution of secondary acoustic deformons (i.e. phonons) to the total energy of liquid\n4\nHe. One can see from our theory of viscosity (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001), that in the\nabsence of secondary effectons and macroeffectons excitations, providing dissipation in\nliquids, the viscosity of liquid tends to zero: \uf052 \uf0b8 0. In accordance with hierarchic theory of\nthermal conductivity (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001\uf0de, the elimination of secondary acoustic\ndeformons at T \uf0b2 T \uf056 must lead also to enhanced thermal conductivity. This effect was\nregistered experimentally in superfluids, indeed.\n4. The increase in E\uf0ddk\uf0de in Fig. 1 at T \uf03c T \uf056 can be induced by the enhanced contribution\nof primary polyeffectons to the total energy of He II and the factor: U tot /T k \uf03d S \uf03f1 in new\nstate equation, derived in Hierarchic theory. The activity of the normal component of He II,\nas a solvent for polyeffectons, reduces and tends to zero at T \uf0b8 0. Under such condition\n\uf0ddT \uf03d 0\uf0de super-polymerization and total Bose-condensation occur in the volume of 4 He.\nThe maximum in Fig. 13 at 0 \uf03c T \uf03c T \uf056 is a result of competition of two opposite\nfactors: rise in the total energy of He II due to progress of primary effectons\npolymerization and its reduction due to the decline of the most probable group velocity\n\uf0ddv gr \uf0de, accompanied by secondary effectons and deformons degeneration. The latter process\npredominates at T \uf0b8 0. The development of a polyeffectons superfluid subsystem is\naccompanied by corresponding diminution of the normal component in He II \uf0dd\uf05f S \uf0b8 1 and\n\uf05f \uf0b8 0\uf0de. The normal component has a bigger internal energy than superfluid one.\nThe own dimensions of primary translational and librational effectons in composition of\npolyeffectons increases at T \uf0b8 0.\nInaccessibility of b-state of primary effectons at T \uf0b2 T \uf056\nLet us analyze our formula (Kaivarainen, 2001) for phase velocity of primary effectons\nin the acoustic (a)-state at condition T \uf0b2 T \uf056 , when filament - like polyeffectons from\n\n\f131\nmolecules of liquid originate:\nv aph\n\nvS\n\n\uf03d\n1\uf02b\n\n1\uf03ff d\nfa\n\nPb\nPa\n\n\uf058 bres\n\n14.28\n\n\uf058 bres\n\nwhere: v S is the sound velocity; P b and P a are the thermal accessibilities of the (b) and (a)\nstates of primary effectons; f d and f a are the probabilities of primary deformons and\nprimary effectons in (a) state excitations.\nOne can see from (14.28), that if:\nP b \uf0b8 0, then P d \uf03d P b P a \uf0b8 0 and f d \uf0b8 0 at T \uf0b2 T \uf056\nthen phase velocity of the effecton in (a) state tends to sound velocity:\nv aph \uf0b8 v S\n\n14.29\n\nFor these \uf056 \uf03f point conditions, the total energy of 4 He atoms, forming polyeffectons\ndue to Bose-condensation of secondary effectons can be presented as:\nE tot \uf069 E a \uf03d mv gr v aph \uf0b8 mv gr v S\n\n14.30\n\nwhere the empirical sound velocity in He II is v S \uf03d 2. 4 \uf036 10 4 cm/s.\nThe kinetic energy of wave B at the same conditions is T k \uf03d mv 2gr /2. Dividing E tot by\nT k we have, using (14.16):\nE tot\nvS\n1\n1\nv gr \uf03d 2T k \uf03d 2S \uf03d 2\uf0ddm \uf044 /m\uf0de\n\n14.31\n\nv 0gr \uf03d v s \uf036 2S 0 \uf03d 2. 4 \uf036 10 4 \uf0d7 0. 32 \uf03d 7. 6 \uf036 10 3 cm/s.\n\n14.32\n\nand\n\nm \uf044 \uf03d 0. 16m is the semiempirical effective mass at T \uf03d T \uf056 .\nThe most probable wave B length corresponding to (14.32) at \uf056-point:\n\uf056 0 \uf03d h/mv 0gr \uf03d 15. 1 \u00c5\nThe number of 4 He atoms in the volume of such effecton, calculated in accordance with\n(14.23) is equal: q 0 \uf03d \uf0ddn 0v \uf0de 1/3 \uf03d 3. 8.\nThis result is even closer to one predicted by the hierarchic model (eq. 14.24) than\n(14.22). It confirms that at T \uf0b2 T \uf056 the probability of b-state P b \uf0b8 0 and conditions (14.29)\nand (14.30), following from our model, take a place indeed. In such a way our hierarchic\nmodel of superfluidity explains the available experimental data on liquid 4 He in a non\ncontradiction manner, as a limit case of our hierarchic viscosity theory for normal liquids.\nSuperfluidity in 3 He\nThe scenario of superfluity, described above for Bose-liquid of 4 He \uf0ddS \uf03d 0\uf0de in principle\nis valid for Fermi-liquid of 3 He \uf0ddS \uf03d \uf0b11/2\uf0de as well. A basic difference is determined by an\nadditional preliminary stage related to the formation of Cooper pairs of 3 He atoms with\ntotal spins, equal to S \uf03d 1\uf0a4, i.e. with boson's properties. The bosons only can form primary\neffectons, as a coherent clusters containing particles with equal kinetic energies.\n3\nWe assume in our model that Cooper's pairs [ 3 He \uf0b7 \uf0e9 He \uf0b7 \uf0e0 S\uf03d1 can be formed\n\n64\n\n\f132\nbetween neighboring 3 He atoms of opposite spins by head-to principle, when their spins\nare the additive values. It means that the minimum number of 3 He atoms forming part of\nthe primary effecton's edge at \uf056-point must be 8, i.e. two times more than that in 4 He\n(condition 14.24). Correspondingly, the number of 3 He atoms in the volume of an effecton\nis \uf0ddn 0V \uf0de 3 He \uf03d 8 3 \uf03d 312. These conditions explains the fact that superfluidity in 3 He arises at\ntemperature T \uf03d 2. 6 \uf036 10 \uf03f3 K, i.e. much lower than that in 4 He. For the other hand, the\nlength of coherence in superfluid 3 He is much bigger that in 4 He.\nThe formation of flexible filament-like polyeffectons, representing macroscopic\nBose-condensate in liquid 3 He responsible for superfluidity, is a process, similar to that in\n4\nHe described above. Good review of vortex formation in superfluid 3 He and analogies in\nin quantum field theory is presented by Eltsov, Krusius and Volovik (2004).\nIn contrast to 4 He II there are two major phases of superfluid 3 He, the A and B phases.\nThe important for us neutron - induced vortical filaments formation have been performed in\nthe quasi-isotropic 3 He-B (Ruutu et al. 1966). In the present context the vortices in 3 He-B\nare similar to those in superfluid 4 He-II.\n14.6 Stimulation of vortex bundles formation in 3 He-B by spinning elementary particles\nA cylindrical sample container with superfluid 3 He \uf03f B was rotated at constant angular\nvelocity and temperature T, under NMR absorption monitoring. When the sample is\nirradiated with neutrons, vortex lines are observed to form. The neutron source was located\nat a proper distance (few tens of cm) from the cryostat so that vortex lines are observed to\nform in well resolved individual events. The experimental signal for the appearance of a\nnew vortex line is an abrupt jump in NMR absorption.\nLiquid 3 He-B can be locally heated with the absorption reaction of a thermal neutron:\nn \uf02b 32 He \uf0b8 p \uf02b 31 H \uf02bE 0 \uf0ddE 0 \uf03d 764 keV)\nThe reaction products, a proton and a triton ( 31 H\uf0de produce two collinear ionization\ntracks (Meyer and Sloan 1997). The ionized particles, electrons and 3 He ions, diffuse in the\nliquid and recombine. About 80 % or more of E 0 is spent to heat a small volume with a\nradius about 50 \uf057m, turning its superfluid state into the normal one.\nSubsequently, the heated volume of normal liquid cools back through T c in\nmicroseconds. The measurements demonstrate that vortex lines are stimulated by neutron\nabsorption event indeed. In the rotating experiments in Helsinki these rectilinear vortex\nlines are counted with NMR methods (Ruutu et al. 1996a).\nIn other series of 3 He experiments, performed in Grenoble (Bauerle et al. 1996, 1998a),\nthe vortices formed in a neutron absorption event are detected calorimetrically. In zero\ntemperature limit the mutual friction becomes vanishingly small and the life time of the\nvorticity very long.\nYarmchuk and Packard (1982) obtained images of a vortex in superfluid by imaging of\nelectrons, initially trapped by the vortex cores.\nWe consider stimulation of vortex bundles formation in superfluids by elementary\nparticles, as a confirmation of our model of fermions as a triplets of sub-elementary\nfermions, rotation around joint axis (Fig.2). Corresponding superfluid vortical filaments are\na structures, analogues to introduced Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy,\nformed by Bivacuum dipoles, connecting coherent elementary particles (see Fig.12 and\ncorresponding comments).\nThe ability of quantum objects rotation to induce the vortical structures in quantum\nliquid was obtained in work of Madison et al. (2000). They stir with a focused laser beam a\nBose-Einstein condensate of 87Rb atoms confined in a magnetic trap. The formation from\nsingle to eleven vortices, increasing with frequency of beam rotation was observed. The\n\n\f133\nmeasurements of the decay of a vortex array once the stirring laser beam is removed was\nperformed.\nThis author propose, that the orbits of planets around rotating stars and star systems\naround rotating center of galactic (supermassive black hole) may correspond to vortical\nfilaments of superfluid fraction of Bivacuum, induced by central object rotation. In\naccordance to presented theory, these filaments are formed by closed bundles of virtual\ni\nguides \uf0dfN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\uf0e0 x,y,z . These orbits quantization may follow the\nrules of angular momentum quantization, induced by rotating objects in superfluids. The\nevidence supporting such idea is existing (Dinicastro, 2005).\n15 New kind of Bivacuum mediated nonlocal interaction between macroscopic objects\n15.1 The stages of Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI) activation between Sender and\nReceiver\nTheories of Virtual Replica (VR) of material objects in Bivacuum and primary VR\nMultiplication (VRM), described in chapter 13, in combination with theory of Virtual\nGuides (VirG SME \uf0de (see chapter 14), are the background for explanation of different kind of\nparanormal phenomena, including parapsychology. The primary VR represents a\nthree-dimensional (3D) superposition of Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPW \uf0b1m and\nVirSW \uf0b11/2\nm , modulated by \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of elementary particles and translational and\nlibrational de Broglie waves of molecules of macroscopic object.\nThe infinitive multiplication of VR in space and time: VRM(r,t) in form of 3D packets\nof virtual standing waves, representing iterated primary VR, is a result of interference of all\npervading external coherent basic reference waves - Bivacuum Virtual Pressure Waves\n(VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 ) and Virtual Spin Waves (VirSW \uf0b11/2\nq\uf03d1 ) with similar kinds of modulated standing\n\uf0b11/2\n\uf0b1\nwaves (VPW m and VirSW m ), forming primary VR. The latter can be considered as the\nobject waves, making it possible to name the VRM, as Holoiteration by analogy with\nregular hologram (see chapter 13).\nWe put forward a conjecture, that the dependence of complex VRM(t) on time is a\nconsequence of its ability to self-organization in both directions - positive (evolution) and\nnegative (devolution) in nonequilibrium conditions. Virtuality of such systems, means by\ndefinition, that relativistic mechanics and causality principle do not work for them.\nDepending on the type modulation (section 13.2) VR and VRM(r,t) are subdivided on\nthe:\na) frequency modulated;\nb) amplitude modulated;\nc) phase modulated;\nd) polarization modulated.\nOnly their superposition contains all the information about positions and dynamics of\natoms/molecules, composing object, possibilities of their evolution and devolution.\nThe nonlocal Virtual Guides (VirG SME ) of spin, momentum and energy (chapter 14),\nrepresent virtual microtubules with properties of one-dimensional virtual Bose condensate,\nconstructed from 'head-to-tail' polymerized Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 ) or Cooper pairs of\nBivacuum fermions (BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 ). The bundles of VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de, connecting\ncoherent atoms of Sender (S) and Receiver (S) are responsible for nonlocal Bivacuum\nmediated interaction between them. The introduced in our theory Bivacuum Mediated\nInteraction (BMI\uf0de is a new fundamental interaction due to superposition of Virtual replicas\nof Sender and Receiver and connection of their coherent atoms via VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\nbundles (eq.14.7a):\n\n\f134\nn\n\nN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7\n\n\uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\nx,y,z\n\nwhere: \uf0ddn\uf0de is a number of pairs of similar tuned elementary particles (protons, neutrons\nand electrons) in atoms and molecules of S and R; N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de is a number of coherent\natoms/molecules in the coherent molecular clusters - mesoscopic BC (Kaivarainen, 2001;\n2004).\nJust BMI(r,t) is responsible for remote ultraweak nonlocal interaction and different\npsi-phenomena. For activation of psi-channels the system: [S \uf02b R] should be in\nnonequilibrium state.\nAfter our Unified Model, the informational (spin), momentum and energy\nexchange interaction between Sender [S] and Receiver [R], representing Virtual tunnel\nformation, involves following three stages:\n1. Superposition of nonlocal (informational/spin) components of [S] and [R] Virtual\nReplicas Multiplication:\nnl\nVRM nl\nS \uf039 VRM R\n\n15.1\n\nformed by modulated by the objects de Broglie waves virtual spin waves of Sender and\nand VirSW S\uf03d\uf0b11/2\n;\nReceiver: VirSW S\uf03d\uf0b11/2\nR\nS\n2.

For activation of this channel, the whole system:\n\uf0dd\uf0dfS\uf0e0 \uf02b \uf0dfR\uf0e0\uf0de should be in nonequilibrium state.\nWe put forward a conjecture, that even teleportation or spatial exchange of\nmacroscopic number of coherent atoms between very remote regions of the Universe\n(teleportation) is possible via coherent Virtual tunnels. If this consequence of this\ntheory will be confirmed, we get a new crucial method of the instant inter-stars\npropulsion.\nFor special case if Sender \uf0dfS\uf0e0 or Receiver \uf0dfR\uf0e0 is psychic, the double conducting\nmembranes of the coherent nerve cells (like in axons) may provide the cumulative Casimir\neffect, contributing Virtual Replica of [S] and [R].\n\n1\nx,y,z\n\nVirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de is quasi-1D virtual microtubule (quasi one-dimensional virtual\nBVB \uf0b1\n\uf03c\uf03d\uf07b\uf03d\uf03e\nVirSW S\uf03d\uf03f1/2\nof\nBose condensate), formed primarily by standing VirSW S\uf03d\uf02b1/2\nR\nS\n\ndis\nVRM dis\nS \uf039 VRM R \uf03d\n\ni\n\n15.3\n\n\f135\nThe quantum neurodynamics processes in Sender (Healer) may be accompanied by\nradiation of electromagnetic waves or magnetic impulses, propagating in Bivacuum via\nvirtual guides: VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de. Such kind of radiation from different regions of\nSender/Healer has been revealed experimentally.\nThe important role in Bivacuum mediated Mind-Matter and Mind-Mind interaction,\nplays the coherent fraction of water in microtubules of neurons in state of mesoscopic\nmolecular Bose condensate (mBC) (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086).\nThis fraction of mBC is a variable parameter, dependent on structural state of microtubules\nand number of simultaneous elementary acts of consciousness (Kaivarainen:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003045). It can be modulated not only by excitation of nerve\ncells, but also by specific interaction with virtual replica of one or more chromosomes\n(VR DNA \uf0de of the same or other cells.\nThe change of frequency of selected kind of thermal fluctuations, like cavitational ones,\nin the volume of receiver [R], including cytoplasm water of nerve cells, is accompanied by\nreversible disassembly of microtubules and actin' filaments, i.e. \uf0dfgel \uf0f0 sol\uf0e0 transitions.\nThese reactions, responsible for elementary act of consciousness, are dependent on the\nchanges of corresponding activation barriers.\nThe mechanisms of macroscopic quantum entanglement, proposed in our work, is\nresponsible for change of intermolecular Van der Waals interaction in the volume of [R]\nand probability of selected thermal fluctuations (i.e. cavitational fluctuations), induced by\n[S]. In this case, realization of certain series of elementary acts of consciousness of [S] will\ninduce similar series in nerve system of [R]. This means informational exchange between\nVR R and VR S of two psychics via Virtual Guides: VirG iSME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de, and their bundles,\nforming Virtual tunnels, which may be named Psi-channels:\nn\n\nN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7\n\n\uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\nx,y,z\n\nThe specific character of telepathic signal transmission from [S] to [R] may be\nprovided by modulation of VRM SMT of microtubules by VRM SDNA of DNA of sender's\nchromosomes in neuron ensembles, responsible for subconsciousness, imagination and\nconsciousness. The resonance - the most effective remote informational/energy exchange\nbetween two psychics is dependent on corresponding 'tuning' of their nerve systems. As a\nbackground of this tuning can be the described Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI)\nbetween the crucial neurons components of [S] to [R]:\n\n\uf03e\n\n2 centrioles \uf02b chromosomes\n\nBMI\n\nS\n\n\uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e\n\n\uf03e\n\n2 centrioles \uf02b chromosomes\n\nR\n\nIn accordance to our theory of elementary act of consciousness and three stages of BMI\nmediated Psi channel formation, described above, the modulation of dynamics of\n[assembly \uf0f0 disassembly] of microtubules by influence on probability of cavitational\nfluctuations in the nerve cells and corresponding \uf0dfgel \uf0f0 sol\uf0e0 transitions by directed mental\nactivity of [Sender] can provide telepathic contact and remote viewing between [Sender]\nand [Receiver].\nThe mechanism of remote healing could be the same, but the local targets in the body\nof patient [R] are not necessarily the MTs and chromosomes of the nerve cells, but\ncentrioles \uf02b chromosomes of the ill organs (heart, liver, etc.).\nThe telekinesis, as example of mind-matter interaction, should be accompanied by\nsignificant nonequilibrium process in the nerve system of Sender, related to increasing of\nkinetic energy of coherent molecules in neurons of Sender, like cumulative momentum of\n\n15.4\n\n\f136\nwater clusters, coherently melting in microtubules of centrioles and inducing their\ndisassembly. Corresponding momentum and kinetic energy are transmitted to 'receiver target' via multiple correlated bundles of VirG SME in superimposed VRM S,R (Psichannels).\nThe specific magnetic potential exchange between [S] and [R] via Virtual tunnel can be\ngenerated by the nerve impulse regular propagation along the axons and depolarization of\nnerve cells membranes (i.e. electric current) in the 'tuned' ensemble of neuron cells of\npsychic - [Sender], accompanied by magnetic flux. These processes are accompanied by\nBVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0 BVB \uf0b1 \uf0f0 BVF \uf0b9 equilibrium shift to the right or left, representing magnetic field\nexcitation.\nThe evidence are existing, that Virtual tunnel between [S] and [R] works better, if the\nfrequencies of geomagnetic Schumann waves - around 8 Hz (close to brain waves\nfrequency) are the same in location of [S] and [R]. However, the main coherence factor in\naccordance to our theory, are all-pervading Bivacuum virtual pressure waves (VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de,\nwith basic Compton frequency [\uf067 0 \uf03d m 0 c 2 /\uf0a4\uf0e0 i , equal to carrying frequency of [Corpuscle\n\uf0f0 Wave] pulsations of the electrons, protons, neurons, composing real matter and providing\nentanglement. The macroscopic Bivacuum flicker fluctuation, activated by nonregular\nchanges/jumps in properties of complex Hierarchical Virtual replica of Solar system and\neven galactic, related to sideral time, also may influence on quality of Psi-chanells between\nSender and Receiver.\nFormation of the different kinds of virtual standing waves, representing nonlocal and\ndistant fractions of Virtual Replicas (VR) S,R of Sender [S] and Receiver [R], necessary\nn\n\nVirtual tunnel: N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n1\n\ni\n\nformation, are presented in Table\nx,y,z\n\n\f137\nTABLE 1\n\nThe role of paired and unpaired sub-elementary particles\nof the electron's [Corpuscle \uf0f0 Wave] pulsation and rotation:\n\uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 W \uf02b \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de C \uf0d7 \uf0f0 \uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 C \uf02b \uf0ddF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf0de W \uf0d7\n\nin Bivacuum mediated interaction between sender [S] and receiver\n[R]\nPair of sub-elementary particle\n\nUnpaired sub-elementary\n\nand antiparticle pulsation and rotation:\n\nfermion pulsation and rotation:\n\n\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 W \uf0f0 \uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf02b\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf03f\uf0b9 \uf0e0 C\n\n\uf0ddF \uf0b1\uf0b7\uf0b9 \uf0de C \uf0f0 \uf0ddF \uf0b1\uf0b7\uf0b9 \uf0de W \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf03e VirSW \uf0df\uf0de\n\nCVC \uf0df\uf0de\n\nBvSO\n\n1.

The\nvirtual replica (VR) of microtubules and its multiplication (VRM) can be modulated also by\nsecondary virtual replicas of DNA.\n15.2 The examples of Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI) between macroscopic objects\nIn accordance to our approach, the remote interaction between macroscopic Sender [S]\nand Receiver [R] can be realized, as a result of Bivacuum mediated interaction (BMI), like\nsuperposition of distant and nonlocal components of their Virtual Replicas Multiplication\n(VRM S \uf07b VRM R ), described in previous sections.\nNonequilibrium processes in [Sender], accompanied by acceleration of particles, like\nevaporation, heating, cooling, melting, boiling etc. may stimulate the nonelastic effects in\nthe volume of [Receiver] and increments of modulated virtual pressure and spin waves\n(\uf041VPW \uf0b1m and \uf041VirSW \uf0b11/2\nm \uf0de, accompanied [C \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of triplets\n\uf02b\n\uf03f\n\uf0b1\ni\n\uf0dfF \uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0bb \uf03e , formed by sub-elementary fermions of different generation,\nrepresenting electrons, protons and neutrons.\nThe following unconventional kinds of effects of nonelectromagnetic and\nnon-gravitational nature can be anticipated in the remote interaction between macroscopic\nnonequilibrium [Sender] and sensitive detector [Receiver] via multiple Virtual spin and\nenergy guides VirG SME (Fig.4), if our theory of nonlocal spin, momentum and energy\nexchange between [S] and [R], described above is correct:\nI. Weak repulsion and attraction between 'tuned' [S] and [R] and rotational momentum\nin [R] induced by [S], as a result of transmission of momentum/kinetic energy and angular\nmomentum (spin) between elementary particles of [S] and [R]. The probability of such\n'tuned' interaction between [S] and [R] is dependent on dimensions of coherent clusters of\natoms and molecules of condensed matter in state of mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC)\n(Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001; 2003; 2004). The number of atoms in such clusters N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de is\nn\n\nrelated to number of VirG SME in the bundles N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\n,\nx,y,z\n\nconnecting tuned mBC in [S] and [R]. The N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de may be regulated by temperature,\nultrasound, etc. The kinetic energy distant transmission from atoms of [S] to atoms of [R]\nmay be accompanied by the temperature and local pressure/sound effects in [R];\nII. Increasing the probability of thermal fluctuations in the volume of [R] due to\ndecreasing of Van der Waals interactions, because of charges screening effects, induced by\noverlapping of distant virtual replicas of [S] and [R] and increasing of dielectric\npermittivity of Bivacuum. In water the variation of probability of cavitational fluctuations\nshould by accompanied by the in-phase variation of pH and electric conductivity due to\nshifting the equilibrium: H 2 O \uf0f0 H \uf02b \uf02b HO \uf03f to the right or left;\nIII. Small changing of mass of [R] in conditions, changing the probability of the\ninelastic recoil effects in the volume of [R] under influence of [S];\nIV. Registration of metastable virtual particles (photons, electrons, positrons), as a\n\n\f139\nresult of Bivacuum symmetry perturbations.\nThe first kind (I) of new class of interactions between coherent fermions of [S] and [R]\nis a result of huge number (bundles) of correlated virtual spin-momentum-energy guides\nVirG SME \uf0af \uf0dfVirSW \uf0dfS \uf03d\uf07b \uf07b\uf03d VirSW \uf0deR \uf0e0 formation by standing spin waves (VirSW S,R ).\nThese guides can be responsible for:\na) virtual signals (phase/spin), momentum and kinetic energy instant transmission\nbetween [S] and [R], meaning the nonlocal information and energy exchange;\nb) the regulation of Pauli repulsion effects between fermions of [S] and [R] with\nparallel spins;\nc) the transmission of macroscopic rotational momentum from [S] of [R]. This process\nn\n\nprovided by N\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\n, is dependent on the difference\nx,y,z\n\nbetween the external angular momentums of elementary fermions of [S] and [R].\nThe second kind (II) of phenomena: influence of [S] on probability of thermal\nfluctuations in [R], - is a consequence of the additional symmetry shift in Bivacuum\nfermions (BVF \uf0bb \uf0de, induced by superposition of distant and nonlocal multiplicated Virtual\nReplicas of [S] and [R]: VRM S \uf039 VRM R , which is accompanied by increasing of\nBivacuum fermions (BVF \uf0bb \uf03d \uf0dfV \uf02b \uf0fa V \uf03f \uf0e0\uf0de virtual charge: \uf041e \uf03d \uf0dde V \uf02b \uf03f e V \uf03f \uf0de \uf03c\uf03c e 0 in the\nvolume of [R]. Corresponding increasing of Bivacuum permittivity (\uf050 0 \uf0de and decreasing\nmagnetic permeability (\uf057 0 \uf0de : \uf050 0 \uf03d 1/\uf0dd\uf057 0 c 2 \uf0de is responsible for the charges screening\neffects in volume of [R], induced by [S]. This weakens the electromagnetic Van der Waals\ninteraction between molecules of [R] and increases the probability of defects origination\nand cavitational fluctuations in solid or liquid phase of Receiver.\nThe third kind of phenomena (III): reversible decreasing of mass of rigid [R] can be a\nresult of reversible lost of energy of Corpuscular phase of particles, as a consequence of\ninelastic recoil effects, following the in-phase \uf0dfC \uf0b8 W\uf0e0 transition of N coh coherent\nnucleons in the volume of [R].\nThe probability of recoil effects can be enhanced by heating the rigid object or by\nstriking it by another hard object. This effect can be registered directly - by the object mass\ndecreasing. In conditions, close to equilibrium, the Matter - Bivacuum energy exchange\nrelaxation time, following the process of coherent \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of macroscopic\nfraction of atoms is very short and corresponding mass defect effect is undetectable. Such\ncollective recoil effect of coherent particles could be big in superconducting or superfluid\nsystems of macroscopic Bose condensation or in good crystals, with big domains of atoms\nin state of Bose condensation.\nThe fourth kind of the above listed phenomena - increasing the probability of virtual\nparticles and antiparticles origination in asymmetric Bivacuum in condition of forced\nresonance with exciting Bivacuum virtual waves was discussed earlier (Kaivarainen\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0103031).\nIt was demonstrated (Kaivarainen: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027), that the listed\nnontrivial consequences of our Unified theory (I - IV) are consistent with unusual data,\nobtained by groups of Kozyrev (1984; 1991) and Korotaev (1999; 2000). It is important to\nnote, that these experiments are incompatible with existing today paradigm. It means that\nthe current paradigm is timed out and should be replaced by the new one.\n15.3 The idea of nonlocal signals transmitter and detector construction and testing\nThe simple constructions of artificial physical devices with functions of [Sender] and\none or more [Receiver] for verification of nonlocal mechanism of communication via\nVirtual Guides of spin/information, momentum and energy, following from our Unified\n\n\f140\ntheory, were suggested (Kaivarainen, 2004a; 2004b). They can represent two or more\nidentical and 'tuned' to each other superconducting or superfluid multi-rings or\ntorus/donuts systems.\nThe pair: [S] and [R] can be presented by two identical systems, composed from the\nsame number (7 or more) of superconducting or superfluid rings of decreasing radius - from\nmeters to centimeters, following Fibonacci series, because of fundamental role of Golden\nmean in Nature, enclosed in each other. The \"tuning\" of Virtual Replicas of [S] and [R]\nconstructions in state of macroscopic Bose condensation (superconducting or superfluid)\ncan be realized by keeping them nearby with parallel orientation of two set of rings during\nfew hours for equalizing of their physical parameters, i.e. currents. After such tuning, they\ncan be removed from each other, keeping their superconducting or superfluid state on at the\nsame temperature, pressure and other conditions. The separation can be increased from\nhundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers and tested for signals transmission in each\nequipped for such experiments laboratory.\nThe experiments for registration of nonlocal interactions could be performed, as\nfollows. At the precisely fixed time moment, the superfluid or superconducting properties of\none of rings of Sender [S], should be switched off by heating, ultrasound or magnetic field\n(Meissner effect). At the same moment of time the superconducting or superfluid\nparameters of all rings of Receiver [R] should be registered. If the biggest changes will\noccur in the ring of [R]-system with the same radius, as that in [S]-system and faster, than\nlight velocity, it will be a confirmation of possibility of nonlocal Bivacuum mediated\ninformation and momentum exchange (entanglement), following from our theory and based\non resonant principles. The corresponding remote signals exchange via proposed in our\nwork Virtual Guides (VirG SME \uf0de, should not be shielded by any screen.\nThere are a number of laboratories over the World, capable to perform the proposed\nexperimental project. In the case of success, such Nonlocal Signals Detector/Transmitter\n(NSD/T) with variable parameters would be the invaluable tool for extraterrestrial\ncivilizations search in projects, like SETI and for distant cosmos exploration (NASA). On\nthe Earth, the Internet, radio and TV - nets also will get a strong challenge.\n15.4 GeoNet of CAMP based - Detectors of Water Properties, as a Supersensor of\nTerrestrial and Extraterrestrial Coherent Signals\nThe idea of GeoNet of equidistantly distributed over the surface of the Earth hundreds\nof water detectors, serving as a Supersensor is based on unique informational possibilities\nof new optoacoustic device: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP). The\nCAMP is one of applications of new Hierarchic theory of condensed matter, general for\nliquids and solids (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207114). Using theory based computer\nprogram (copyright, 1997, USA, Kaivarainen) and four input experimental parameters,\nmeasured at the same temperature and pressure:\n1) sound velocity;\n2) density\n3) refraction index and\n4) positions of translational and librational bands in IR or Raman spectra it is possible, using PC in less than second, to calculate more than 300 physical\nparameters of water, ice or other condensed matter. These parameters include internal\nenergy, heat capacity, viscosity, self-diffusion, thermal conductivity, surface tension,\ndimensions and life-times of 24 quantum excitations, describing condensed matter dynamic\nstructure.\nWater is a sensitive detector for any kind of fields, including gravitational one via\nbundles of nonlocal Virtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy\n\n\f141\nn\n\nN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7 \uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\n. The Sun, Moon and perhaps, the black hole in\nx,y,z\n\ncenter of our galactic are the strongest sources of coherent oscillations of gravitational field\n(GF), existing in accordance to our theory, in form of modulated virtual pressure waves of\n\uf03f\npositive and negative energy \uf0ddVPW \uf02b and VPW \uf0de, interacting with protons and electrons\nof water molecules.\nThe induced by GF coherent changes of water physical properties on the remote points\nof the Earth surface, registered by CAMP devices, can be analyzed by the global CAMP GeoNet system via Internet.\nThe corresponding coherent variations of physical properties of standard aqueous\nsolutions in EM screened vessels by Faraday cages at constant temperature and pressure\ncould be monitored by CAMP. Such [water samples/detectors \uf02b CAMP], will be distributed\nover the surface of the Earth, forming a nodes of GeoNet.\nI propose to use such GeoNet on the Earth surface, like giant Supersensor for terrestrial\nand extraterrestrial coherent signals registration. For this end a hundreds of standard\nwater-filled cells, unified with CAMP, over the planet surface should be under permanent\ncentralized control, using satellites and the Internet. The Fourier analysis of the input\nsignals, inducing water perturbations, registered by CAMP, makes it possible to select only\ncoherent patterns of dynamic changes of water properties in big number of water-filled\ncells over the Earth. These patterns will be analyzed for getting the detailed information\nabout the amplitude and frequency of coherent signals.\nSensitivity of proposed global sensor system - GeoNet is much higher than existing\ncurrently technics due to its global scale and the CAMP huge informational possibilities.\nThe localization and forecast of the Earthquakes are a minimum results of such global\nproject realization. This forecasting compensate quickly all related to project of GeoNet\nexpenses.\nThe valuable knowledge about the influence of gravitational dynamics of Sun, Moon\nand planets of Solar system on the geophysical process on the Earth could be obtained via\nproposed GeoNet of CAMP systems.\n\nMain Conclusions\n1. A new Bivacuum model is developed, as the infinite dynamic superfluid matrix of\nvirtual dipoles, named Bivacuum fermions (BVF \uf0bb ) i and Bivacuum bosons (BVB \uf0b1 \uf0de i ,\nformed by correlated torus (V \uf02b \uf0de and antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de, as a collective excitations of\nsubquantum particles and antiparticles of opposite energy, charge and magnetic moments,\nseparated by energy gap. In primordial symmetric Bivacuum, i.e. in the absence of matter\nand fields, these parameters of torus and antitorus totally compensate each other. Their\nspatial and energetic properties correspond to three generations of electrons, muons and\ntauons (i \uf03d e, \uf057, \uf062\uf0de. The symmetric primordial Bivacuum can be considered as the\nUniversal Reference Frame (URF), i.e. Ether, in contrast to Relative Reference Frame\n(RRF), used in special relativity (SR) theory. The elements of Ether - ethons correspond to\nour Bivacuum dipoles. It is shown in our work, that the result of Michelson - Morley\nexperiment can be a consequence of ether drug by the Earth or Virtual Replica of the Earth\nin terms of our theory. The positive and negative Virtual Pressure Waves (VPW \uf0b1q \uf0de and\n\uf0de are the result of emission and absorption of positive and\nVirtual Spin Waves (VirSW S\uf03d\uf0b11/2\nq\nnegative energy Virtual Clouds (VC \uf0b1q \uf0de, resulting from transitions of torus V \uf02b and antitorus\nV \uf03f between different states of excitation, symmetrical in realms of positive and negative\nenergy: j \uf03f k \uf03d q;\n\n\f142\n2. The symmetry shift between V \uf02b and V \uf03f actual and complementary mass and charge\nto the left or right, opposite for Bivacuum fermions BVF \uf0b7 and antifermions BVF \uf0b9 , has the\nrelativistic and reverse to that dependence on these dipoles external tangential or pure\ntranslational velocity. It is shown, that the value of Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift is a\ncriteria of their external absolute velocity, characterizing properties of secondary\nBivacuum. This shift is accompanied by sub-elementary fermion and antifermion\nformation. The formation of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions and their fusion to\nstable triplets of elementary fermions, like electrons or protons \uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0d7 e,p ,\nfollowing by the rest mass and charge origination, become possible at the certain rotation\nvelocity (v) of Cooper pairs of \uf0dfBVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 around their common axis. It is shown, that\nthis rotational-translational velocity value is determined by Golden Mean condition:\n(v/c) 2 \uf03d \uf064 \uf03d 0. 618. The close values of centripetal and Coulomb interaction, calculated on\nthe base of most important parameters of paired sub-elementary fermions in their\nCorpuscular phase, following from our model of elementary particles and time theory, is\nvery important fact. It is a strong evidence in proof of our Unified theory of Bivacuum,\nelementary particles, mass and charge origination at Golden mean conditions and theory\nof time;\next\n3. The fundamental physical roots of Golden Mean condition: (v/c) 2 \uf03d v ext\ngr /v ph \uf03d \uf064 are\nrevealed, as the equality of internal and external group and phase velocities of torus and\next\nin\next\nantitorus of sub-elementary fermions, correspondingly: v in\ngr \uf03d v gr ; v ph \uf03d v ph . These\nequalities are named 'Hidden Harmony Conditions';\n4. The new expressions for total, potential (V) and kinetic (T k \uf0de energies of de Broglie\nwaves of elementary particles were obtained. One of the expressions represents the\nextended basic Einstein - de Broglie formula E tot \uf03d m 0 c 2 \uf03d \uf0a4\uf067 0 for free particle:\nE tisot \uf03d V \uf02b T k \uf03d 1 \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 \uf02b 1 \uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2\n2\n2\nor : E tot \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 \uf03d \uf0a4\uf067 C\uf0f0W \uf03d\nor : E tot \uf03d \uf0a4\uf067 C\uf0f0W \uf03d\nwhere: V \uf03d\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf02b m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 ; T k \uf03d\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 m 0 c 2 \uf02b h 2 /m \uf02bV \uf056 2B\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 \uf0a4\uf067 0 \uf02b h\uf058 B\n1\n2\n\n\uf0ddm \uf02bV \uf03f m \uf03fV \uf0dec 2 ; m \uf02bV \uf03d m 0 / 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 and\n\nm \uf03fV \uf03d m 0 1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2 are the actual (inertial) and complementary (inertialess) mass of\ntorus and antitorus of sub-elementary fermion, correspondingly; \uf067 C\uf0f0W \uf03d m \uf02bV c 2 /\uf0a4 is the\nresulting frequency of \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of sub-elementary fermion; \uf067 0 \uf03d m 0 c 2 /h is the\nCompton frequency of internal \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation.\nThe new formulas take into account the contributions of the actual mass/energy of torus\n(V \uf02b \uf0de and those of complementary antitorus (V \uf03f \uf0de, correspondingly, of asymmetric\nsub-elementary fermions to the total ones. The shift of symmetry between the inertial and\ninertialess mass and other parameters of torus and antitorus of sub-elementary fermions are\ndependent on their internal rotational-translational dynamics in composition of triplets and\nthe external translational velocity of the whole triplets. The latter determines the external\ntranslational momentum and the empirical de Broglie wave frequency: \uf058 B \uf03d m \uf02bV v 2 /h and\nlength: \uf056 B \uf03d h/m \uf02bV v;\n5. A dynamic mechanism of [corpuscle (C) \uf0f0 wave (W)] duality is proposed. It\ninvolves the modulation of the internal (hidden) quantum beats frequency between the\nasymmetric 'actual' (torus) and 'complementary' (antitorus) states of sub-elementary\nfermions or antifermions by the external - empirical de Broglie wave frequency of the\nwhole particles (triplets), equal to beats of similar states of the 'anchor' Bivacuum fermion.\n\n\f143\nIn nonrelativistic conditions such modulation stands for the wave packets origination. The\nprocess of transition of corpuscular phase to the wave phase is accompanied by reversible\nchange of translational degrees of freedom to rotational ones;\n6. The high-frequency photon is a result of fusion (annihilation) of two triplets of\nparticle and antiparticle. It represents a rotating sextet of sub-elementary fermions and\nantifermions with axial structural symmetry and minimum energy 2m e0 c 2 . The regular\nphotons are the result of excitation of secondary anchor sites of the electrons or protons\nexcitation. The secondary anchor site represents three correlated Cooper pairs 3[BVF \uf0b7 \uf039\nBVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 ias . Its excitation can be a result of charge acceleration, like in ondulators or that,\naccompanied the transitions between excited and ground states of atoms and molecules.\nThe electromagnetic field is a result of Corpuscle - Wave pulsation of photons, exciting\n\uf0dfVPW \uf02b \uf039 VPW \uf03f \uf0e0 and their fast rotation with angle velocity (\uf067 rot ), equal to \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0\npulsation frequency. The clockwise or anticlockwise direction of photon rotation, as respect\nto direction of its propagation, corresponds to its spin sign: s \uf03d \uf0b1\uf0a4;\n7. It is shown, that the information, encrypted in ancient Sri-Yantra diagram, can be\ninterpreted as a confirmation of proposed mechanisms of origination of the rest mass and\ncharge of elementary particles just at Golden Mean conditions and their corpuscle - wave\nduality;\n8. The electrostatic and magnetic fields origination is a consequence of reversible\n\uf0dfrecoil \uf0ef antirecoil\uf0e0 effects in Bivacuum matrix, generated by correlated\n\uf0dfCorpuscle \uf0ef Wave\uf0e0 pulsation of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions of triplets and\ntheir fast rotation, accompanied by Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift and shift of\nequilibrium of Bivacuum fermions [BVF \uf0b7 \uf0f0 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 to the left (North pole) or to the right\n(South pole). The linear and axial alignment of Bivacuum dipoles and their dynamics are\nresponsible for electrostatic and magnetic fields 'force lines' origination, correspondingly.\nThe zero-point vibrations of particles and evaluated zero-point velocity of these vibrations\nare also the result of \uf0dfrecoil \uf0ef antirecoil\uf0e0 effects, accompanied by \uf0dfC \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation of\ntriplets in state of rest, when their external translational velocity is zero;\n9. The gravitational waves and field are the result of positive and negative energy\nvirtual pressure waves excitation (VPW \uf02bq and VPW \uf03fq \uf0de by the in-phase \uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation\nof pairs \uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 of triplets \uf0d6\uf0dfF \uf03f\uf0b7 \uf039 F \uf02b\uf0b9 \uf0e0 \uf02b F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0d7, counterphase to that of unpaired F \uf0b1\uf0bb \uf0d7.\nSuch virtual waves provide the attraction or repulsion between pulsing remote particles,\ndepending on phase shift of pulsations, as in the case of hydrodynamic Bjerknes force\ninteraction.\nThe potential gravitational energy of huge number of Bivacuum dipoles in space\nbetween gravitating objects is equal to sum of the absolute values of energies of torus and\nantitorus of these dipoles:\nN\uf0b8\uf04b\n\nE 0G\n\n\uf03d\uf03e\n\nN\uf0b8\uf04b\n\n\uf04b\uf0ddm \uf02bV\n\n\uf02b\n\nm \uf03fV \uf0dec 2\n\n\uf03d\uf03e \uf04bm 0 c 2 \uf0dd2n \uf02b 1\uf0de\n\nWhen the in-phase pulsations of pairs of remote triplets turns to counterphase,\ndepending on distance between objects or under magnetic field action, changing spin state\nof these fermions, the gravitation turns to antigravitation. The antigravitation is responsible\nfor so-called negative pressure or dark energy.\nThis attraction gravitational energy of 'empty' Bivacuum, when m \uf02bV \uf03d m \uf03fV \uf03d m 0 is\ngenerated by VPW \uf0b1q , radiated and absorbed in the process of symmetric transitions of torus\nand antitorus between excited and ground states: E VPW \uf0b1q \uf03d \uf0b1q \uf0a4\uf067 0 , compensating each\nother: \uf02bq \uf0a4\uf067 0 \uf03d \uf03fq \uf0a4\uf067 0 . Such mechanism of huge volumes of 'empty' Bivacuum\ndetermines the cold dark matter effect;\n\n\f144\n10. Maxwell's displacement current and the additional instant currents are the\nconsequences of Bivacuum dipoles (BVF \uf0fa and BVB \uf0b1 ) in empty space symmetric\nexcitations and vibrations, correspondingly. Their vibrations, corresponding to properties of\nsecondary Bivacuum, represent reversible elastic deformations of Bivacuum matrix,\ninduced by presence of fields and remote matter. The increasing of the excluded for\nphotons volume of toruses and antitoruses due to their rotations and vibrations, enhance the\nrefraction index of Bivacuum and decrease the light velocity near gravitating and charged\nobjects. The nonzero contribution of the rest mass energy to photons and neutrino energy is\na consequence of the enhanced refraction index of secondary Bivacuum and corresponding\ndecreasing of the effective light velocity (for details see section 8.11). The latter can be\nrevealed by small shift of Doppler effect in EM radiation of the probe in gravitational field.\nThe 'Pioneer anomaly' is a good example of such phenomena;\n11. It is shown that the Principle of least action and realization of 2nd and 3d laws of\nthermodynamics for closed systems - can be a result of slowing down the dynamics of\nparticles and their kinetic energy decreasing, under the influence of basic - lower frequency\nVirtual Pressure Waves (VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 \uf0de with minimum quantum number q \uf03d j \uf03f k \uf03d 1. This is a\nconsequence of forced combinational resonance between [C \uf0ef W\uf0e0 pulsation of particles\nand basic VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 of Bivacuum;\n12. The dimensionless 'pace of time' (dt/t \uf03d \uf03fdT k /T k ) and time of action \uf0ddt\uf0de itself for\neach closed conservative system are determined by the change of this system kinetic\nenergy. The time is positive, if dynamics of particles is slowing down and negative in the\nopposite case. This new concept of time is more advanced, than that of Einstein relativistic\ntheory. For example, our formula for time includes not only velocity, but also acceleration\nof the object and frequency of its orbital rotation:\nt\uf03d \uf03f\nwhere: \uf067 \uf03d \uf03f\n\nv\ndv/dt\n\n\uf03f1\n\n1 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\nv\ndv/dt 2 \uf03f \uf0ddv/c\uf0de 2\n\n\uf03d\nW\n\n2\n1 1 \uf03f \uf0dd r \uf067/c\uf0de\n\uf067 2 \uf03f \uf0dd r \uf067/c\uf0de 2\n\nC\n\n\uf03d v/ r \uf03d 2\uf05e\uf058 is the angular frequency of the object rotation\n\nwith radius of orbit r .\nIn contrast to time definition, following from special relativity, the time of action is\ninfinitive and independent on velocity in any inertial system of particles, when acceleration\nis zero. However, at any nonzero acceleration: a \uf03d dv/dt \uf03d \uf067 2 r \uf03d G rM2 \uf03d const \uf03e 0,\nincluding case of orbital rotation, the time is dependent on velocity of these objects in more\ncomplex manner, than it follows from special relativity. In fact, there are no physical\nsystems in our expanding with acceleration Universe which can be considered, as perfectly\ninertial. This means, that relativistic formula for time (12.15) is not valid in general case. It\nis demonstrated, that proposed 'time of action' theory confirms our model of elementary\nparticles from sub-elementary fermions, including mass and charge origination, explains\nthe Fermat principle and all experiments, which where considered, as a confirmation of\nspecial and general relativity;\n13. Theory of Virtual Replica (VR) of material objects in Bivacuum and VR\nMultiplication: VRM (r,t). The primary VR represents a three-dimensional (3D)\nsuperposition of Bivacuum virtual standing waves VPW \uf0b1m and VirSW \uf0b11/2\nm , modulated by\n\uf0dfC \uf0f0 W\uf0e0 pulsation of elementary particles and translational and librational de Broglie\nwaves of molecules of macroscopic object (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027). The\ninfinitive multiplication of primary VR in space in form of 3D packets of virtual standing\nwaves, representing set of secondary VR: VRM(r), is a result of interference of all\npervading external coherent basic reference waves - Bivacuum Virtual Pressure Waves\n\n\f145\n(VPW \uf0b1q\uf03d1 ) and Virtual Spin Waves (VirSW \uf0b11/2\nq\uf03d1 ) with similar kinds of modulated standing\nwaves, forming VR. The VR plays the role of the object waves. This phenomena may stand\nfor remote vision of psychic. The ability of enough complex system of VRM(r,t) to\nself-organization in nonequilibrium conditions, make it possible multiplication of primary\nVR not only in space but as well, in time in both time direction - positive (evolution) and\nnegative (devolution). The feedback reaction between most probable/stable VRM(r,t) and\nnerve system of psychic, including visual centers of brain, can by responsible for\nclairvoyance. The VRM of elementary particles coincides with notion of their secondary\nanchor sites, representing three conjugated Cooper pairs 3[BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 ias of asymmetric\nBivacuum fermions. The stochastic jumps of CVC \uf0b1 of [W] phase of particle from one\nanchor site to another and the ability of interference of single particle with its own anchor\nsite explains two slit experiment;\n14. The new general presentation of wave function, based on our wave-corpuscle\nduality model, takes into account not only the external translational dynamics of particle,\nbut also the internal rotational-translational one, responsible for the rest mass and charge\norigination;\n15. The eigen wave functions, as a solutions of Shr\u00f6dinger equation, describe the linear\nsuperposition of multiple anchor site, as a possible alternatives for realization of particle's\n[C] phase;\n16. A possible Mechanism of Quantum entanglement between remote coherent\nelementary particles: electrons and nuclears of atoms of Sender(S) and Receiver(R) via\nVirtual Guides of spin, momentum and energy (VirG S,M,E \uf0de is proposed. The single\n\uf0b1\n\uf0b1 i\nVirG BVB\nS,M,E can be assembled from Bivacuum bosons \uf0ddBVB \uf0de by 'head-to-tail' principle.\n\uf0b7 \uf039BVF \uf0b9\nfrom the adjacent microtubules, rotating in opposite directions,\nThe doubled VirG BVF\nS,M,E\ncan be formed by Cooper pairs of Bivacuum fermions [BVF \uf0b7 \uf039 BVF \uf0b9 \uf0e0 i , polymerized by\nthe same principle. The spin/information transmission via Virtual Guides is accompanied\nby reorientation of spins of tori and antitori of Bivacuum dipoles. The momentum and\nenergy transmission from S to R is realized by the instant pulsation of diameter of such\nvirtual microtubule with frequency of beats, equal to difference between frequencies of\nC \uf0f0 W pulsation of S and R. The length of VirG S,M,E , connecting fluctuating in space\nparticles of (S) and (R), also can correspondingly vary, because of immediate\nself-assembly/disassembly of VirG S,M,E from the infinitive source of Bivacuum dipoles.\nThe Virtual Guides of both kinds represent the quasi 1D virtual Bose condensate with\nnonlocal properties, similar to that of 'wormholes'. The bundles of VirG SME , connecting\ncoherent atoms of Sender (S) and Receiver (S), as well as nonlocal component of\nVRM(r,t), determined by interference pattern of Virtual Spin Waves, are responsible for\nnonlocal weak interaction;\n17. The introduced Bivacuum Mediated Interaction (BMI\uf0de is a new fundamental\ninteraction, resulting from superposition of Virtual replicas of Sender and Receiver,\nbecause of VRM(r,t) mechanism, and connection of their coherent elementary particles in\ncoherent atoms via Virtual Guides bundles:\nn\n\nN\uf0ddt, r\uf0de \uf0d7\n\n\uf03e VirG SME \uf0ddS \uf03c\uf03d\uf03e R\uf0de\n\ni\n\nx,y,z\n\nJust BMI is responsible for remote ultraweak nonlocal interaction. The system: [S \uf02b R]\nshould be in nonequilibrium state.\n\n\f146\n\nReferences\nAdams, J.S., S.R. Bandler, S.M. Brouer, R.E. Lanou, H.J. Maris, T. More and G.M. Seidel,\n1995, Phys. Lett.
