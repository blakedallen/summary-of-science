It has been pointed\nout that the quantized Hall conductivity is written in\nterms of the Berry phase as well as the Chern number\nin the 2D systems [14]. Recently, the authors generalize\nthe relation to 3D systems [15]. By using the relation\nbetween the Berry phase and the quantized Hall conductance, we can find out that the macroscopic polarization\nis closely related to the Berry phase. The relation between the macroscopic polarization and the Berry phase\nseems to be analogous to the spontaneous polarization in\nthe crystalline dielectrics [6].\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe presence of the geometrical phase (Berry phase)\nwas revealed in the adiabatic process of a quantum mechanical system around a closed loop in a parameter\nspace [1]. Thus, it could be regarded as the generalization\nof the Aharonov-Bohm effect [2] in a parameter space.\nThe Berry phase has been appeared in many contexts, for\nexample, a treatment of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [3], fractional statistics [4], the axial anomaly in\nfield theories [5], and so on.\nRecently, the relation between the spontaneous electric polarization in crystalline dielectrics and the Berry\nphase was discussed [6]. The authors of Ref. [6] treated\nthe system as Bloch electrons with a finite energy gap in\nthe absence of electromagnetic fields. They introduce an\nadiabatic change of the potential (Kohn-Sham potential)\nwith a slowly varying parameter \u03bb. The Hamiltonian is\ncompactified in the parameter space, and then, a Berry\nphase is defined in the adiabatic process. The charge\ntransfer occurs and the polarization is induced in this\nprocess with external electric field held to be zero, and it\nis represented by the Berry phase [6].\nThe two-dimensional (2D) Bloch electron system with\nan uniform magnetic field has been investigated for a long\ntime [7], and it has been revealed that the integer quantum Hall effect occurs when the Fermi energy lies in an\nenergy gap [8]. The integer part of the quantized Hall\nconductance ne2 /h (n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12 * **) is represented by\nthe Chern number [9,10], which is a topological number\ndefined on the two-torus (the magnetic Brillouin zone).\nThe effect is generalized to 3D [11,12]. Recent arguments\npoint out that the band gap could exist for the magnetic\nfield around 40 Tesla in organic compounds (TMTSF)2 X\n[12,13]. Then, to realize the quantum Hall effect of Bloch\nelectrons in 3D may be easier than that in 2D.\n\nRecently, the adiabatic pumping is discussed progressively [16,17]. In pumping, an adiabatic ac perturbation\nyields a dc current, and the charge transfer per the cycle\nis independent on the period of the perturbation. We also\nargue the relation between our results and the adiabatic\npumping.\nIn section II, we consider the 2D system. 3D system is\ndiscussed in section III. We set the light velocity c = 1\nthroughout the discussion.\n\n1\n\n\fgauge transformation is required to make the Hamiltonian invariant. It is well known that we can construct\nthe magnetic translation operators, which commute with\nHamiltonian, written as\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\ne\n(5)\nTR = exp iR * \u2212i\u2207 \u2212 A(t) .\nh\u0304\n\nII. MACROSCOPIC POLARIZATION AND\nBERRY PHASE IN 2D SYSTEM\n\nIn this section, we treat 2D noninteracting electrons in\na periodic potential in the presence of a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and a uniform electric field in the plane. The electric field is represented by\na time-dependent vector potential. Then we employ the\nadiabatic approximation assuming that the electric field\nis weak enough. In order to make the paper self-contained\nand fix the notations, we would like to introduce the discussions in Ref. [14], first. We review that the existence\nof the Berry phase is demonstrated in this situation and\nthat the Chern number is written in terms of the Berry\nphase [14]. The Chern number is well known as a topological number which represents the integer part of the\nquantized Hall conductance in the system [8\u201310]. After\nthese reviews, we show that the macroscopic electric polarization, whose time derivative corresponds to the Hall\ncurrent in the system, is written in terms of the Berry\nphase.\nThe time-dependent Shr\u00f6dinger equation we consider\nhere is\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03a8(t)\n= H(t)\u03a8(t),\n\u2202t\n\nHere we use the symmetric gauge A = (B \u00d7 r)/2. Now\nwe look for eigenstates which simultaneously diagonalize\nTR and H. However, note that the magnetic translations\ndo not commute with each other in general, since\nTa Tb = exp[2\u03c0i\u03c6]Tb Ta ,\n\nwhere \u03c6 = (eB/h)|a \u00d7 b| is the number of magnetic\nflux quanta in a unit cell. When \u03c6 is a rational number\n\u03c6 = p/q (p and q are integers with no common factor),\nwe have a subset of translations which commute with\neach other. We consider the enlarged unit cell (the magnetic unit cell), in which integral magnetic flux quanta\ngo through. For example, if we take the Bravais lattice\nvectors as\nR\u2032 = ma + nqb,\n\n1\n(\u2212ih\u0304\u2207 + eA(t))2 + U (r),\n2m\n\nand A(t) is the vector potential for the electromagnetic\nfield, therefore, the magnetic field and the electric field\nare given by B = \u2207 \u00d7 A and E = \u2212\u2202A/\u2202t, respectively.\nWe take the Bravais lattice vectors as\nR = ma + nb,\n\nTa \u03a6(\u03b1) = eik*a \u03a6(\u03b1) ,\nTqb \u03a6(\u03b1) = eik*qb \u03a6(\u03b1) ,\n\n(2)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere h\u0304k is the generalized crystal momentum in the\nmagnetic Brillouin zone (MBZ). By using the primitive\nvectors of the reciprocal lattice\n\nwhere m and n are integers, and assume that the potential is periodic in both a- and b- directions, i.e.\nU (r) = U (r + a) = U (r + b).\n\n(7)\n\nthen p of the magnetic flux quanta penetrates the magnetic unit cell which is enclosed by the vectors a and\nqb. The magnetic translation operators TR\u2032 which corresponds to the new Bravais lattice vectors commute with\neach other.\nLet \u03a6(\u03b1) be an simultaneous eigenfunction of the operators H and TR\u2032 , here \u03b1 denotes the band index. Then\nthe eigenvalues of Ta and Tqb are given by\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nH(t) =\n\n(6)\n\n2\u03c0\n(b \u00d7 \u1e91),\nv0\n2\u03c0\nGb =\n(\u1e91 \u00d7 a),\nv0\nv0 = \u1e91 * (a \u00d7 b),\n\nGa =\n\n(3)\n\nWe suppose that the electric field is weak enough. Then\nthe system evolves slowly so that it can be described by\nthe adiabatic approximation. At any instant, we have an\neigenvalue equation\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2\n(\u2212ih\u0304\u2207 + eA(t)) + U (r) \u03a6n (t, r)\nH(t)\u03a6n (t, r) =\n2m\n= En (t)\u03a6n (t, r).\n(4)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u1e91 is the unit vector perpendicular to the 2D plane,\nk is written as\nfb\nGb\nq\n0 \u2264 fa \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 fb \u2264 1.\n\nk = fa Ga +\n\nThe system is invariant under translations by a and by\nb. However, the Hamiltonian H(t) is not invariant under\nthese transformations. The reason for this is that the vector potential A(t) is not constant in space in spite of the\nfact that the magnetic field is uniform. An appropriate\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, the eigenfunction is labeled by k in addition\nto the band index \u03b1. For the magnetic translation invariance, we can write down the eigenfunction in the Bloch\nform\n2\n\n\f(\u03b1)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\n\u03a6k (r, t) = eik*r uk (r, t).\n\napplied along Ga \u22a5 b. Then the time-dependence of the\nHamiltonian Hk (t) enters in the form k \u2212 (eEv0 t/hb)Ga .\nThus we have uk (t) = uk\u2212(eEv0 t/hb)Ga , where uk (t =\n0) = uk , and the period of a transport around a closed\npath in the parameter space is given by T = (hb/eEv0 )\n[18]. The Berry phase is obtained from Eq. (16) as\n\n(11)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nFrom Eq.(5) and Eq.(8), uk (r, t) should satisfy the relation\ni\nh e\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nuk (r + a, t) = exp i a * A(t) uk (r, t),\nh\u0304\ni\nh e\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nuk (r + qb, t) = exp i qb * A(t) uk (r, t).\n(12)\nh\u0304\n\n\u0393a (fb ) = i\n\n=\n\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nEk (t)uk (r, t),\n\n=i\n\n(14)\n\nNow, we have the \"Hamiltonian\" Hk (t), which contains\n(\u03b1)\nthe parameters k and t.

A related result\nis obtained in a different context [19].\nWe see the relation between our discussion and the\nadiabatic charge pumping originally argued by Thouless\n[16,17]. The adiabatic pumping is the charge transport\nwhose specific properties are: (i) the adiabatic ac perturbation yields the dc current, (ii) the charge transfer does\nnot depend on the period of the perturbation [17].\nIn our system, the perturbation (the electric field) itself is not ac, but the Hamiltonian Hk (t) is compactified\nin the parameter space and the period T is introduced,\nand the dc Hall current Eq. (32) flows.\nThe statements (d) and (e) imply the fact that the\ncharge transfer per T across the boundary of the magnetic unit cell does not depend on T , which corresponds\nto the property (ii) of the adiabatic pumping, and is\nquantized. Actually, one can see it directly. For E \u22a5 b,\nthe Hall current \u2202Pb /\u2202t flows parallel to b and across\nthe boundary a-axis. The normal vector of the boundary\nis Ga /|Ga |. Then, the charge transfer is\n\ndt\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nwhere \u0393a,b is the Berry phase for the \u03b1-th band and we\nuse Eq. (27). The result shows that the electric dipole\nmoment per the magnetic unit cell is quantized as an\ninteger multiple of \u2212eqb.\nSimilarly, when E//Gb \u22a5 a, the period T = ha/eEqv0\nand\ne X (\u03b1)\nNCh .\n(34)\n\u2206Pa = a\nqv0\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b1F\n\nIt is also written by the Berry phase by using Eq. (27) as\nwell as the Chern number. The electric dipole moment\nper the magnetic unit cell is integer multiple of ea.\nOne could point out the specific properties of the polarization in our system as follows;\n\n\u2206Q =\n\nZ\n\nT\n\ndt\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndfa\n0\n\nGa \u2202Pb\n*\n|Ga | \u2202t\n\nGa\n=\n* \u2206Pb\ndfa\n|G\na|\n0\nX (\u03b1)\n= \u2212e\nNCh .\n\n(a) introduced by the adiabatic process\n(b) perpendicular to E\n(c) written by the Berry phase\n\n(35)\n\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b1F\n\n(d) independent of T , i.e. independent of |E|\n\nFor E \u22a5 a, the charge transfer is\n\n(e) the induced dipole moment per the magnetic unit\ncell per the period T is quantized\n\n\u2206Q = e\n\nX\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nNCh .\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b1\u2264\u03b1F\n\nFrom (a) and (b), one can see that the polarization in\nour system is quite different in the usual dielectric polarization in the insulators. In the adiabatic process, the\nsystem always remains in the ground state. In insulators, the longitudinal conductivity and the translational\nconductivity is zero, and the charge transport would not\noccur adiabatically. Then, the finite polarization is obtained beyond the adiabatic approximation and the direction of the polarization is along the external electric\nfield E. In our system, we have a finite transverse conductivity because of the presence of the magnetic field. The\ntransverse charge transport occurs even in the adiabatic\nprocess and the polarization is induced perpendicular to\nE.\nThe properties (a) and (c) suggests that the polarization in our system has some similarity to the spontaneous\nmacroscopic polarization in the crystalline dielectrics. It\nhas been pointed out by King-Smith and Vanderbilt, and\nResta [6] that the spontaneous polarization is induced by\nan adiabatic change of the potential (Kohn-Sham potential) with a slowly varying parameter \u03bb. The process is\n\nSimilar results are obtained by Thouless for the commensurate periodic ac perturbation [16]. The commensurability seems to correspond to the direction of E in our\ndiscussion (See. Eq. (20)), which is essential to define T\nand \u2206Q.\n\nIII. MACROSCOPIC POLARIZATION AND\nBERRY PHASE IN 3D SYSTEM\n\nThe aim of this section is to argue the 3D generalization of the discussions in the previous section. We define\nthe macroscopic polarization. One can see that its time\nderivative is equivalent to the quantized Hall current in\n3D. The Hall conductivity is represented by the Chern\nnumber and quantized when the Fermi energy lies on the\nband gap [11]. Recent arguments point out that such a\ngap could exist for the magnetic field around 40 Tesla in\norganic compounds (TMTSF)2 X [12,13]. Then, it may\n5\n\n\fbe easier to realize the quantum Hall effect of Bloch electrons in 3D rather than 2D. Our discussion written below could be applicable to such compounds by using the\ntight-binding scheme.\nThe relation between the Berry phase and the Chern\nnumber is also driven in the system [15]. Then, we would\nfind out the relation between the macroscopic polarization and the Berry phase in 3D system as well as 2D\nsystem. We also point out the relation between our results and the adiabatic pumping [16,17].\nLet us consider the 3D Bloch electrons in the presence\nof uniform electromagnetic fields. We have a periodic\npotential U (r) = U (r + la + mb + nc) (l, m, n; integers).\nThe electric field we consider here is weak and described\nby an adiabatically changing vector potential. We use\nthe adiabatic approximation and first, we consider the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian H(t) at fixed t.\nWe have a magnetic field written as,\nB = Ba a + Bb b + Bc c,\n\nThen we can choose four integers sa , sb , sc and sr , which\nsatisfy relations\nsa na + sc nc = r, sb nb + sr r = 1,\nand we may choose\na\u2032 = sc a \u2212 sa c,\nsb na\nsb nc\nc\u2212\na.\nb\u2032 = s r b \u2212\nr\nr\nThe Hamiltonian has the magnetic translation symmetry. Actually, we can choose the magnetic unit cell with\nthe primitive vectors a\u2032 , qb\u2032 and c\u2032 , and the magnetic\ntranslation operators for the Bravais lattice\nR\u2032 = la\u2032 + mqb\u2032 + nc\u2032 (l, m, n; integer),\nis written by the 3D generalization of Eq. (5) when we\ntake the symmetric gauge. Three operators Ta\u2032 , Tqb\u2032 and\nTc\u2032 commute with the Hamiltonian at any instant, and\nalso with each other. The wavevector in the magnetic\nBrillouin zone (MBZ) is written as\n\n(37)\n\nwhere a, b and c are the primitive vectors for the Bravais\nlattice. Let Ga = (2\u03c0/v0 )(b \u00d7 c), Gb = (2\u03c0/v0 )(c \u00d7 a)\nand Gc = (2\u03c0/v0 )(a \u00d7 b) stand for the fundamental reciprocal lattice vectors, where v0 = a * (b \u00d7 c). Ba , Bb\nand Bc are written as,\n1\nB * Ga =\n2\u03c0\n1\nB * Gb =\nBb =\n2\u03c0\n1\nBc =\nB * Gc =\n2\u03c0\n\nBa =\n\n1 h\n\u03c6a ,\nv0 e\n1 h\n\u03c6b ,\nv0 e\n1 h\n\u03c6c ,\nv0 e\n\nk = fa\u2032 Ga\u2032 +\n\nThen, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian at any instant is the generalized Bloch states. The Bloch wave\nfunction with a band index \u03b1 is written as \u03a6\u03b1\nk (r, t) =\nik*r (\u03b1)\n\u03b1\ne uk (r, t), where uk (r, t) satisfies\n(\u03b1)\n\nHk (t)uk (t, r)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(\u03b1)\n(\u2212i\u2207 + k + eA(t))2 + U (r) uk (t, r)\n=\n2m\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03c6a , \u03c6b and \u03c6c is a number of the unit flux through\nthe plane b \u00d7 c, c \u00d7 a and a \u00d7 b, respectively.

SUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we have considered Bloch electrons in\nthe presence of uniform electromagnetic fields in 2D and\n3D. The Berry phase has been induced by the adiabatic\nchange of the time-dependent vector potential. Following\nRef. [6], the electric macroscopic polarization has been\ndefined in the system. It has been shown that the time\nderivative of the macroscopic electric polarization corresponds to the quantized Hall current in the system whose\nconductivity is represented by the Chern number. Recently, it was shown that the Hall conductivity is written\nby the Berry phase as well as the Chern number in the 2D\nsystems [14], and also in 3D systems [15]. Then, we have\nfound out that the macroscopic polarization is closely related to the Berry phase. The quantized Hall current and\nalso the polarization has been induced adiabatically. In\nthe adiabatic process, the system always remains in the\nground state, and then, the polarization in our system\nis quite different from the usual dielectric polarization.\nThe relation between the macroscopic polarization and\nthe Berry phase is analogous to that between the spontaneous polarization in the crystalline dielectrics and the\nBerry phase [6]. We have also argued the relation between our results and the adiabatic pumping, which is\ndiscussed progressively [16,17].\nWe have discussed the analogy among the polarization in the quantum Hall system, the spontaneous polarization in dielectric crystalline and the adiabatic pumping. As an essential point, the analogy comes from the\nfact that these effects are caused by the closed adiabatic\nchange in the Bloch electron systems with the finite energy gap.\n\nThen, we calculate the macroscopic polarization change\nper a cycle. As well as 2D, we can define the cycle when E is parallel to the reciprocal lattice vector\nlGa + mGb + nGc . For example, the period is written\nas (See, the paragraph before Eq. (18)),\n\uf8f1 h |b\u2032 \u00d7c\u2032 |\nfor E//Ga\u2032 \u22a5 b\u2032 c\u2032 \u2212 plane,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 v0 eE\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7a |\nT = qvh |c eE\n(57)\nfor E//Gb\u2032 \u22a5 c\u2032 a\u2032 \u2212 plane,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 h0 |a\u2032 \u00d7b\u2032 |\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfor E//Gc\u2032 \u22a5 a b \u2212 plane.\nv0\neE\nThen, the polarization change per T is given;\n\uf8f1 e\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\uf8f2 qv0 (qb tc\u2032 \u2212 c qtb\u2032 ) for E \u22a5 b c \u2212 plane,\ne\n(c\u2032 ta\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 tc\u2032 ) for E \u22a5 c\u2032 a\u2032 \u2212 plane, (58)\n\u2206P =\n\uf8f3 hqv0 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\nqv0 (a qtb \u2212 qb ta ) for E \u22a5 a b \u2212 plane.\n\nFor Eqs. (54),(55) and (56), the polarization is written\nin terms of the Berry phase. The dipole moment per the\nmagnetic unit cell i.e. qv0 \u2206P is quantized in each cases.\nTherefore, one can see that the polarization in 3D also\nhas the properties (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) written in the\nprevious section. Then, the polarization is quite different\nfrom the usual dielectric polarization and has similarity\nwith the spontaneous polarization in dielectric crystalline\n[6]. As a property that it is absent in 2D, one can point\nout that the polarization changes its direction discretely\nin the 2D plane perpendicular to E, when one changes\nthe location of the Fermi level. The fact reflects the feature of the 3D quantized Hall effect [11].\nAs well as 2D, the quantization of the dipole moment\nper the magnetic unit cell per T implies the quantized\ncharge transfer across the boundary of the magnetic unit\ncell per T . As the simple extension of Eq. (35) to 3D,\none can obtain the charge transfer\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2212e(qtb\u2032 \u2212 tc\u2032 ) for E \u22a5 b\u2032 c\u2032 \u2212 plane,\n(59)\n\u2212e(tc\u2032 \u2212 ta\u2032 ) for E \u22a5 c\u2032 a\u2032 \u2212 plane,\n\u2206Q =\n\uf8f3\n\u2212e(ta\u2032 \u2212 qtb\u2032 ) for E \u22a5 a\u2032 b\u2032 \u2212 plane.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to H.
