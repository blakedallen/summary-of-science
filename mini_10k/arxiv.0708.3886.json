In high temperature superconductors, besides the superconducting phase, many\ncompeting orders, such as, spin density wave (SDW)1,2 ,\nd-density wave (DDW)3,4 , pair density wave (PDW)5,6 ,\nstripe7 , and so on, have been proposed to explain various experimental observations. Those competing orders\ncan be generally classified into two categories, the orders\nin particle-particle (P-P) channel and the orders in the\nparticle-hole (P-H) channel. So far, most of theoretical\nworks in cuprates have focused on the effect of individual\ncompeting orders. However, the orders in two channels\nare not completely independent of each other. In some\ncases, they must be correlated. In this paper, we detailed\nstudy one of these examples, the extended s-wave PDW\norder in the P-P channel and the d-wave checkerboard\ndensity (DWCB) order in the P-H channel.\nThe motivation of this study mainly comes from\nthe recent experiments of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy(STM) in cuprates. These experiments have\nrevealed surprising yet important electronic structures\nin the high temperature superconductors. The Fourier\ntransform scanning tunneling spectroscopies (FT-STS)\nfrom STM have captured two different general features in\nboth momentum and energy spaces8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 .\nOne feature is dispersive peaks in FT-STS11,12 , interpreted as interference patterns caused by elastic scattering of quasiparticles from impurities17 . The other\nis non-dispersive peaks, a checkerboard modulation observed in various different materials and circumstances.\nThe checkerboard structure was first discovered locally in\nBSCCO near a vortex core8,18 . Then, it was found to be\na characteristic of the large gap regions where the STM\nspectrum resembles that in the pseudogap phase9,12,14 .\n\nLater, in the pseudogap phase, a similar checkerboard\npattern was also observed13 . Finally, the STM studies of\nCa2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 revealed the presence of a global long\nrange commensurate checkerboard order independent of\ndoping10 .\nThere have been various theoretical proposals to\nexplain the non-dispersive checkerboard modulations.\nMost of these proposals are related to the competing orders. In these theories, the origin of the non-dispersive\nmodulations are tied to the existence of particular order\nparameters. The theories including pair density modulation5,6,19,20,21 , current density modulation22,23 , spin\nmodulation2 , stripe charge modulation7,24 , and impurity scattering25 and so on.\nAmong the proposed mechanisms, the pair density\nwave (PDW) has been shown to capture important characteristics of the checkerboard density modulation. The\nmechanism of PDW derives from high pairing energy\nscale in cuprates. It suggests that, unlike the superconductivity of normal BCS type superconductors that\ncan be destroyed by breaking Cooper pairs, the superconductivity in cuprates can be more easily weakened or\ndestroyed by phase fluctuations than by pair breaking.\nBased on this argument, pair density localization5 was\nfirst proposed to explain the local checkerboard modulation in the presence of impurity or vortex. Later, a\nglobal pair density wave(PDW) was proposed to explain\nthe checkerboard physics in the pseudogap state6,13 . It\nhas also been shown that the symmetry of the tunneling intensity can distinguish the pair density modulation\nfrom the conventional density modulation6 . While the\npair density modulation provides a good understanding\nof the experimental results, the theory does not cover\ntwo important characterizations of the tunneling experiments, namely, the dichotomy between nodal and antinodal regions and the Fermic arc.\nRecently, we have proposed a d-wave checkerboard\n\n\f2\ndensity (DWCB) order in P-H channel26 . The DWCB\ncan be viewed as a natural extension of the ddensity wave(DDW) order proposed to explain pseudogap physics3,4 , and is only different from the latter in\nterms of order wavevectors. We have shown that the\nDWCB order must exist when the PDW order is present\nin the global d-wave superconducting state. Moreover,\nwe have demonstrated that the DWCB captures many\ngeneral features of the STM experimental results. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the DWCB order has little effect\non the density of state at low energy in the superconducting phase, but has a strong effect on the STM spectrum\naround the superconducting gap at high energy. This result naturally explains the puzzling dichotomy between\nthe nodal and antinodal regions observed in STM14 and\nangle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (APRES)27 .\nThe DWCB order also preserves in FT-STS spectrum\nat the wavevectors, Q = {(\u03c0/2a, 0), (0, \u03c0/2a)}, the same\nsymmetry as that observed in the experiments. Moreover, the DWCB preserves the nodes in the single particle\nspectrum, and generates a Fermi arc with little dispersion around the nodal points at high temperature, which\nare consistent with the results from ARPES. The Fermi\narc has been a signature of the pseudogap region, and\nhas been proposed to explain the checkerboard pattern\nobserved in the pseudogap state28 . Thus, the DWCB\nprovides a physical origin of the Fermi arc.\nIn this paper, by solving the Bogoliubov-deGennes\nequation self-consistently, we further demonstrate the\nresults drawn in ref.26 .\nWe design a microscopic\nmodel with the space modulated density-density interaction. We show that from the self-consistent solutions\nof the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations, a weak spatially\nmodulated density-density interactions can generate the\nDWCB and the PDW orders simultaneously in general.\nThe combination of these two orders captures many important features of the STM experimental results. We organized the rest of this paper as follows: In Sec.II We introduce the d-wave checkerboard density (DWCB) order\nto study the electronic states in the disordered d-wave superconducting states, and the pseudogap phase at a temperature above Tc . In Sec.III we show how the complementary connection between the density orderings in the\nparticle-particle and the particle-hole channels are closely\nrelated in the order wavevector and the symmetries. In\nSec.IV we study the orders in cuprates by calculating a\nfull self-consistent BdG equation including DWCB and\nPDW in the d-wave superconducting state. In Sec.V\nwe calculate the local density of states and the spectral\nweights in the presence of both DWCB and PDW and\ncompare the recent experimental data.\n\nII.\n\nd-WAVE CHECKERBOARD DENSITY\nORDER IN CUPRATES\n\nIn this secion, we shall introduce the DWCB order\nand discuss its roles in different regions of the phase di-\n\nagram in high temperature superconductors. In ref.26 ,\nwe have proposed a DWCB to explain the experimental\nresults observed in the STM measurements in a global dwave superconducting state. It has been shown that the\npresence of DWCB and competition with DSC can capture the physics in a disordered superconducting state\nand in the pseudogap phase at a temperature above\nTc . Here we present a more detailed discussion and\nanalysis. Firstly, we will show the average density of\nstates(DOS) and the Fourier component at the order\nwavevector Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)} calculated in a mixed\nstate of DSC and DWCB orders show good agreements\nwith experiments such as the spatially modulated LDOS\nin the disordered superconductors. Secondly, we will\nshow the presence of the DWCB order with the d-wave\nsuperconducting order at a higher temperature above Tc\nplays an important role in understanding the physics\nof the pseudogap phase: an emergence of the energyindependent Fermi arcs above Tc and the linear dependence of its length on temperature.\nThe mean-field Hamiltonian for the system where the\nDWCB coexists with d-wave superconducting order is\ngiven by\nHMF = H0 + HDWCB ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nH0 =\nHDWCB =\n\nX\n\n\u03bek c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 +\n\nk,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u2206k c\u2020k\u2191 c\u2020\u2212k\u2193 + h.c.

Fig. 1 shows a static pattern of the bond\nstrength of the DWCB order, hB\u0302r i. It is clear that the\nDWCB order defined in Eq.(4) has 4a \u00d7 4a periodicity\nand dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry.

(b) The Fourier components of\nLDOS at Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)}.\n\nWe chose t = 125meV and \u03bc = 0. \u22060 = 40meV, which\nis relevant for underdoped BSCCO. The imaginary part\nof the self energy \u03b7 = 5meV was used for the numerical\ncalculation.\nFig. 2(a) shows the averaged DOS normalized by one\nof the non-interacting Fermi liquids. In the absence of\nDWCB order, i.e. W0 = 0, there are sharp coherence\npeaks at the energy of superconducting gap, as expected.\nAs DWCB order develops, the coherence peaks located at\n40meV are suppressed, while the spectrum at low energy\nremains unchanged. From W0 = 4meV the prominent\npeak begins to appear within the superconducting gap.\nNote that even small DWCB made a strong effect on the\nspectrum at high energy as W0 increases.\nFig. 2(b) shows the Fourier components of LDOS at\nthe wavevectors, Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)}. It is known6\nthat \u03c1Q (\u03c9) = \u03c1Q (\u2212\u03c9) for a bond-centered P-H pairing,\nwhile \u03c1Q (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c1Q (\u2212\u03c9) for a site-centered P-H pairing\nsuch as a conventional charge density wave(CDW). As\nexpected from the fact that the DWCB order is bondcentered, \u03c1Q (\u03c9) is even with respect to \u03c9, and it shows\ngood agreement with experiment9 .\nWe repeat our calculations with the more realistic band\ndispersion provided by Norman et al.29 and the result is\ndisplayed at Fig. 3. The band energy dispersion is now\nmodified as such\n\u03bek =\n+\n+\n+\n\nt1 /2(cos kx + cos ky ) + t2 cos kx cos ky\nt3 /2(cos 2kx + cos 2ky )\nt4 /2(cos 2kx cos ky + cos kx cos 2ky )\nt5 cos 2kx cos 2ky \u2212 \u03bc,\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: Averaged local density of states with the finite chemical potential included in the band dispersion provided by\nNorman et al29 .\n\nwhere t1 = \u22120.5951eV, t2 = 0.1636eV, t3 = \u22120.0519eV,\nt4 = \u221201117eV, and t5 = 0.0510eV29. The chemical potential \u03bc is now set to -0.1660eV. Compared with the\nP-H symmetric case, the effect of DWCB on the averaged DOS and the Fourier component of LDOS at Q is\ninsensitive to the energy band structure. Qualitatively\nthe numerical results are strikingly consistent with experimental results16 , and the large gap region can be interpreted in terms of the coexistence of weak(8-12meV)\nDWCB and DSC orders.\n\nB.\n\nDWCB in the Pseudogap state\n\nThe results of LDOS have demonstrated the consistency between the coexistence of the DWCB and DSC\norders and the STM experimental results in the disordered superconducting state. Now we will show that\nthe presence of the DWCB order also captures important\nphysics in the pseudogap phase at a temperature above\nTc . While there still have been hot debates over the interpretation of the origin of the the pseudogap phase, we will\nshow how many experimental observations in this phase\ncan be explained by interpreting the pseudogap phase as\nthe mixed state of the DWCB and DSC orders. In this\npaper, we will focus on two features of the Fermi arcs\ndeveloped from the nodal point along the Fermi surface:\nnon-dispersive energy-independence and linear temperature dependence.\nThe autocorrelation of ARPES data from BSCCO\nshow non-dispersive peaks in momentum space arising\nfrom the tips of the Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase,\nwhile the superconducting state shows dispersion with\nbinding energy28 . For the temperature dependence of the\nFermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, it is known that its\nlength increases linearly with temperature in the range\nbetween Tc and T \u2217 , below which the material is believed\nto be in the pseudogap phase30 . If the pseudogap phase is\n\nFIG. 4: The spectral function given by Eq.(12) based on\nthe energy dispersion, (10). (a) The energy dependence\nof the Fermi arc along the Fermi surface. The white bars\nwith the magnitude of |Q| = \u03c0/2 are displayed to show the\nFermi arc is non-dispersive. The deviations for the energies\n(\u03c9 = 0, \u221210, \u221220, \u221230 meV) from |Q| are negligibly small by\n8%, 2%, 0%, and 13% of |Q|, respectively. (b) In the prsence\nof DSC(\u22060 = 40 meV) and DWCB(W0 = 8meV), the spectral\nweights, A(k, \u03c9 = 0meV ), are plotted with varying temperature (T = 50K, 100K, 150K, and 200K).\n\nstrongly connected to phase fluctuations of d-wave superconductivity, the single particle spectrum should reflect\nthe DWCB order. Therefore, a robust Fermi arc feature\nshould exist in the mixed DWCB and DSC phases at high\ntemperature. We will show that this is indeed the case.\nIn order to illustrate the emergence of the nondispersive Fermi arc in the pseudogap state with DWCB\norder coexistent with DSC, we have calculated the spectral function A(k, \u03c9) as given by the imaginary part of\nthe retarded Green function:\n1\nA(k, \u03c9) = \u2212 ImG11 (k, \u03c9)\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nFirst we have studied the energy dependence of the Fermi\narcs in the pseudogap state. We have plotted the spectral function A(k, \u03c9) in the first Brillouin zone in Fig. 4\nbased on the energy dispersion, Eq.(10). In Fig. 4(a),\nthe Fermi arcs are in red, and one of the d-wave checkerboard wavevectors, Q = (\u03c0/2, 0), is shown as a white\nbar. The scattering wavevectors connecting the tips of\neach arc are nearly equal to the order wavevectors of\nDWCB, |Q| = \u03c0/2, which is consistent with the nondispersive Fermi arc in experimental observations. The\nsmall dispersion is negligible when compared with the\nelongation of the gapless part along the Fermi surface\nfrom the nodal point in the DSC state without DWCB\norder. It may depend on the band width of the calculation. When including more hopping terms in the energy\nband, the dispersion shown in the simple band calculation will be reduced.\nNow let us consider the temperature dependence of\nA(k, \u03c9) at the Fermi level(\u03c9 = 0meV). It can be calculated in the pseudogap phase by taking the temperature\ndependence as an effect from the self energy, \u03b7. We have\nplotted the spectral function A(k, \u03c9) as a function of the\ntemperature in the first Brillouin zone in Fig. 4(b). At\nvery low temperature the Fermi surface is gapped ex-\n\n\f5\ncept at the nodal point, (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). As the temperature\nrises, the nodal points grow significantly along the Fermi\nsurface with slight broadening in the direction perpendicular to the Fermi surface. We will show the detailed\ncalculations and discuss more in section V.\n\ntion, we will study how these density orderings in both\nchannels are related in the modulation wavevector and\nthe symmetry.\n\nA.\nIII.\nCOMPLEMENTARY CONNECTION\nBETWEEN THE ORDERS IN THE P-P AND P-H\nCHANNELS\n\nIn this section, we will give a general argument regarding the complementary connection between the orders in\nthe particle-particle and the particle-hole channels in the\ndisordered d-wave superconducting state at zero temperature as well as in the pseudogap phase at high temperature above Tc . As shown above, a d-wave checkerboard\norder (DWCB) in the P-H channel, hc\u2020k\u03c3 ck+Q\u03c3 i = \u03a6f (k)\nwith Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)} and f (k) = cos kx \u2212 cos ky ,\ncan explain the experiments on cuprates in the disordered\nDSC state and in the pseudogap phase. Preserving the\nsame symmetry in FT-STS spectrum as that observed in\nexperiments, the DWCB generates Fermi arcs with little\ndispersion with the binding energy around nodal points\nat high temperature above Tc . Since the Fermi arc has\nbeen a signature of the pseudogap, the DWCB provides\na direct link between the competing order and the pseudogap physics.\nThe DWCB, however, is not a completely independent\nmechanism. In fact, there are some intimate connections\nwith other orders in the P-P channel. Due to the existence of a complementary connection between orders in\nboth channels, the DWCB is directly connected to the\nPDW order. The angular symmetry of one orderings is\ndetermined by the combination of the angular symmetries of DSC and the complementary order.

A local\nEk +\u03bek \u2212\u03bc and Ek =\npair fluctuation induced by disorder such as a vortex,\nimpurities, or other factors will lead to a new ground\nstate with nonzero supercurrent due to the uncertainty\nprinciple. In other words, a new ground state |\u03a8i can be\nobtained from the BCS ground state |\u03a8BCS i by applying\na boost of the total momentum q of the Cooper pairs,\n|\u03a8i = e\u03b7\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2217\nk,q (\u03a6q ck\u2191 c\u2212k+q\u2193 \u2212\u03a6q c\u2212k+q\u2193 ck\u2191 )\n\nP\n\n|\u03a8BCS i,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a small parameter and \u03a6q is the structural factor of pair fluctuations determined phenomenologically.\nFor a commensurate checkerboard modulation, \u03a6q will\nbe peaked at the related total momenta q of the pair,\nthat is q = Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)}: \u03a6q \u223c \u03b4q,Q .\nThe effective Hamiltonian associated with |\u03a8i as a\nground state can be obtained as, up to a first order \u03b7,\nHeff = HBCS + Hkin + Hint + O(\u03b7 2 ),\n\n(29)\n\nwhere Hkin and Hint are additional terms generated by\nboosted kinetic and pair interaction terms, respectively,\nin Eq.

And\n\nThe Connection between PDW and DWCB\n\nGiven the close resemblance between DDW and\nDWCB, it is natural to expect that similar results also\nhold for the DWCB order, since the difference between\nDDW and DWCB is the order wavevector Q. Due to the\nhigh energy scale of superconducting gap in HTS, SC can\nbe destroyed or suppressed by phase fluctuations. Carrying out a similar analysis as Gossamer superconductors31 , we can show how the complementary connection\nbetween PDW and DWCB arises in the low energy effective Hamiltonian that describes a system with pair\nmodulation induced by phase fluctuations.\nWe start from a BCS Hamiltonian on a 2D square lattice,\nHBCS =\n\nX\nk,\u03c3\n\n\u03bek c\u2020k,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3 +\n\nX\n\n\u2206k c\u2020k,\u2191 c\u2020\u2212k,\u2193 + h.c., (26)\n\nk\n\nThe superconducting vacuum is constructed by the\nCooper pairs with opposite momentum and spin:\n|\u03a8BCS i = \u00dbBCS |0i \u221d e\n\nP\n\nk\n\n\u03b1k c\u2020k,\u2191 c\u2020\u2212k,\u2193\n\n|0i,\n\n(27)\n\nHint = \u03b7\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03a6q \u2206k c\u2020k,\u03c3 ck+q,\u03c3 + h.c.\n\nk,q,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nWk c\u2020k,\u03c3 ck+q,\u03c3 + h.c.,\n\n(31)\n\nk,\u03c3\n\nP\nwhere Wk = \u03b7 q \u03a6q \u2206k \u223c \u2206k \u03b4q,Q and it represents a\nd-wave density order in the P-H channel, DWCB. The\nabove derivation tells us that a d-wave-like ordering in\nthe P-H channel effectively leads to Cooper pairs with a\nfinite center of mass momentum.\n\nIV.\n\nSELF-CONSISTENT CALCULATION FOR\nPDW AND DWCB\n\nDue to the complementary connection between PDW\nand DWCB, it is suggestive to calculate a fully selfconsistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation including both orders simultaneously. It has been argued that\nlong-range interaction between charge carriers is very important in cuprates. PDW can be induced by the long\nrange interaction between hole-pairs. In this section, we\n\n\f7\nwill show that a solution of a self-consistent calculation\nwith modulating pair potential and nearest neighbor interaction can lead to orderings in both P-P and P-H channels.\nWe start from a full model Hamiltonian on a 2D lattice,\ni X\n1 Xh \u2020\nVij ni nj\ntij ci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c. +\n2 i,j,\u03c3\ni,j\nX\nni ,\n(32)\n\u2212\u03bc\n\nH = \u2212\n\ni\n\nwhere ni = ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 .\nIn particular, we will consider nearest-neighbor hopping, tij = t and an attractive nearest-neighbor interaction, Vij . The chemical potential \u03bc is chosen such that\nit is P-H symmetric case. The nearest-neighbor interactions between two opposite spins are considered to be\nattractive and modulating. They are given by a negative constant pair potential and a long-range interaction\nmodulated by Q = {(\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u03c0/2)},\nVij = \u2212V0 + \u03b4Vij\nX\n= \u2212V0 +\n\u2206Vij (cos Q * ri + cos Q * rj ), (33)\nQ\n\nwhere\n\u2206Vij =\n\n\u001a\n\n+V1 , j = i \u00b1 x\u0302\n\u2212V1 , j = i \u00b1 \u0177\n\n(34)\n\n+\n\ni\nX h (2) \u2020 \u2020\n\u2206ij ci\u2191 cj\u2193 + h.c.\n\nhi,ji\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bcij\u03c3 ni\u03c3 ,\n\nhi,ji\u03c3\n\nwhere\n(1)\n\n\u2206ij\n\n= \u2212V0 (hcj\u2193 ci\u2191 i + hci\u2193 cj\u2191 i) /2\n\nWij = \u2212\u03b4Vij hc\u2020j\u03c3 ci\u03c3 i\n\n(2)\n\u2206ij\n\nhc\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ic\u2020j\u03c3\u2032 cj\u03c3\u2032 + hc\u2020j\u03c3\u2032 cj\u03c3\u2032 ic\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3\n\n= \u03b4Vij (hcj\u2193 ci\u2191 i + hci\u2193 cj\u2191 i) /2\n\n(35)\n\nThe first two terms are nothing but the chemical potential terms. The decouplings in the second line are the\nusual BCS decouplings. The last two terms are decouplings in the P-H channel, which are just the exchange\nterms.

For interactions between two particles with opposite spins, it corresponds to a bond-centered spin density\nwave. From our full Hamiltonian, we can argue that the\nspin rotational symmetry is not broken. Thus the SDW\ndecouplings can be safely ignored. Also, since we are interested in d-wave pairing, the BCS decouplings of triplet\npairing will be dropped, too. We then arrive at the following MF Hamiltonian,\ni\n1 X h\n(t + Wij )c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c.\nHMF = \u2212\n2\nhi,ji\u03c3\ni\nX h (1) \u2020 \u2020\n(36)\n\u2206ij ci\u2191 cj\u2193 + h.c.\n+\nhi,ji\n\nwith V0 and V1 positive constants. While the local behavior of \u03b4Vij seems to be anisotropic at the center\nand (\u00b12a, \u00b12a) as seen in Fig. 5, the global behavior\nis isotropic in a sense that there is no preferential direction for attraction enhanced by negative modulation or\nweakened by positive modulation. The anisotropic modulation is rotationally invariant with the combination of\ntranslation by 4a.\nStarting with this Hamiltonian, let us derive the BdG\nequations by introducing mean-field decoupling of the\nnearest neighbor interaction terms. The quartic term\nni\u03c3 nj\u03c3\u2032 has three different types of mean-field decouplings\n\n\u21d2\n\nFIG. 5: A modulating nearest-neighbor interaction, \u03b4Vij , is\nplotted in a 2D square lattice.\n\nThe pairing amplitude on a bond (i, j), \u2206ij , stems from\na constant nearest neighbor attraction, \u2212V0 , and the density wave pairings in the P-P and the P-H channels are\ncaused by a long-range interaction, \u03b4Vij . Since our major\ninterest is to study the orderings in both channels at the\nsame time, the chemical potential, \u03bcij\u03c3 , is taken to be a\nconstant.\nThe Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nun (i)\nun (i)\nH0 \u2206\u2217\n(41)\n= En\nvn (i)\nvn (i)\n\u2206 \u2212H0\u2217\n\n\f8\nwhere H0 and \u2206 are transfer matrices such that\n\u0010X\n\u0011\nH0 x(i) = \u2212\n(t + Wji ) + \u03bcji x(j)\nj\n\u0011\nX \u0010 (1)\n(2)\n\u2206x(i) =\n\u2206ji + \u2206ji x(j)\nj\n\n(42)\n\n(2)\n\n(43)\n\nwhere x(i) can be either un (i) or vn (i).\nWe numerically solve BdG eigenvalues En and eigenvectors (un (i), vn (i)) on a lattice of N sites with a periodic boundary condition. We then calculate the pairing\namplitude, and the density orderings in the P-P and the\nP-H channels which are, respectively give by,\n(1)\n\n\u2206ij\n\n(2)\n\n\u2206ij\n\nWij\n\nV0 X\n(un (j)vn\u2217 (i) + un (i)vn\u2217 (j))\n2 n\n\u03b4Vij X\n=\n(un (j)vn\u2217 (i) + un (i)vn\u2217 (j))\n2 n\nX\n= \u2212\u03b4Vij\nvn (j)vn\u2217 (i).\n\n= \u2212\n\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n\nn\n\nSubstituting these equations back into the BdG equation, Eq.(41), and repeating the same process until selfconsisitency is achieved for each of the local variables,\nwe can obtain solutions of the BdG equations. In the\ncalculation, we have used Broyden's method for efficient\niteration.\nFrom the self-consistent solution, we can then compute the interesting order parameters. The d-wave pairing amplitude (DSC) at a lattice site r is determined by\n(1)\nfour nearest neighbors, \u2206ij :\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u2206DSC (r) = (\u2206r,r+x\u0302 + \u2206r,r\u2212x\u0302 \u2212 x \u2194 y)/4.\n\n(47)\n\nIn the same way, an extended s-wave pairing density wave\norder in the P-P channels (PDW) can be obtained by\n(2)\n\u2206ij .\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u2206PDW (r) = (\u2206r,r+x\u0302 + \u2206r,r\u2212x\u0302 + x \u2194 y)/4,\n\n(48)\n\nand d-wave density ordering in the P-H channel (DWCB)\nis\nWDWCB (r) = (Wr,r+x\u0302 + Wr,r\u2212x\u0302 \u2212 x \u2194 y)/4.\n\nwhere W0 = 0.06t = 8.3 meV and the order wavevectors\nQ = {(\u00b1\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u00b1\u03c0/2)} as shown in Fig 6 (b).\n(1)\nThe order in P-P channel has both d-wave, \u2206r,r\u2032 , and\n\n(49)\n\nWe shall now present our results of full calculation.\nThe uniform part of the interaction is set to V0 = \u22122.5t\nwhile the modulation part has amplitudes of V1 with the\nrange of 0.1t to 1.0t. The solutions we have obtained are\nindependent of the initial guesses for the local variables.\nIn Fig. 6 (a), the order parameters, \u2206DSC (r), \u2206PDW (r),\nand WDWCB (r), in a 2D real space are plotted for V0 =\n2.5t and V1 = 0.5t with t = 125 meV. The P-H channel\nordering, Wr,r\u2032 shows d-wave symmetry such that\n\u001a\nW0 (cos Q * r + cos Q * r\u2032 ) , r\u2032 = r \u00b1 x\u0302\n\u2032\nWr,r =\n(50)\n\u2212W0 (cos Q * r + cos Q * r\u2032 ) , r\u2032 = r \u00b1 \u0177\n\nextended s-wave, \u2206r,r\u2032 , part. The extended s-wave part\nis a pure modulation described by\n\u001a\n\u22061 (cos Q * r + cos Q * r\u2032 ) , r\u2032 = r \u00b1 x\u0302\n(2)\n\u2206r,r\u2032 =\n(51)\n\u22061 (cos Q * r + cos Q * r\u2032 ) , r\u2032 = r \u00b1 \u0177\nwhere \u22061 = 0.13t = 16.3 meV and the same order\nwavevectors Q. We have also obtained the results of\n(1)\n(1)\nd-wave pairing amplitude, or,\u2206r,r\u00b1x\u0302 = \u22060 and \u2206r,r\u00b1\u0177 =\n\u2212\u22060 with \u22060 = 0.28t. In Fig. 7 the modulation amplitudes of \u2206DSC (r), \u2206PDW (r), and WDWCB (r) were plotted\nas a function of V1 .\nThe self-consistent BdG calculation shows that there is\nindeed a complementary connection between the density\norder in the P-P channel (PDW) and in the P-H channel\n(DWCB). Since PDW and DWCB are based on the same\nmodulating interaction, \u03b4Vij , not only PDW and DWCB\nshould be present simultaneously with d-wave superconductivity but also the symmetries and order wavevector\nQ of both orders should be closely related to each other.\nTherefore, the mean-field solutions in the disordered dwave superconductivity should include a d-wave density\nwave with Q in the P-H pairing and an extended s-wave\ndensity wave with the same Q in the P-H pairing. Furthermore it is important to take both density orders into\naccount on the same footing when we try to understand\nthe electronic states of the disordered high Tc cuprates\nand the pseudogap state at high temperature.\nV.\n\nTHE MIXED DWCB AND PDW STATE\n\nAnalytically, the general features in STM measurements can be captured by the DWCB. Due to the\nanisotropy inherited from the d-wave factor of pairing,\na weak DWCB order has a much stronger effect on the\nantinodal region than on the nodal region. Thus it naturally explains the puzzling dichotomy between the nodal\nand antinodal excitations in high temperature superconductors. The local phase fluctuations of Cooper pairs\nlead to a local modulation of d-wave ordering in the P-H\nchannel (DWCB), which strongly affects the antinodal\nsingle particle excitations, as well as an extended s-wave\norder in the P-P channel (PDW). Since both PDW and\nDWCB are bond-centered, \u03c1Q (\u03c9) will be an even function of \u03c9 6 . This symmetry distinguishes the PDW and\nDWCB orders from the typical CDW in the P-H channel.\nThe existing experimental results are consistent with the\neven case.\nThe purpose of this section is to determine the symmetries of density orders in P-P and P-H channels and then\nstudy the pseudogap physics under the presence of the\norderings in P-P and P-H channels. Due to the complementary connection, if the PDW is an extended s-wave,\nDWCB is a d-wave P-H pairing. If the PDW is a d-wave,\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 6: (a) The amplitude of the order parameters, \u2206DSC (r), \u2206PDW (r), and WDWCB (r) defined by Eq.

(b)\nThe Fourier transforms of the order parameters are displayed in the first Brillouin zone. The prominent peaks are located at\nQ = {(\u00b1\u03c0/2, 0), (0, \u00b1\u03c0/2)} in both PDW and DWCB.\n\nthe P-H pairing density order must be extended s-wave.\nIt is worth noting that the symmetries of the orders are\nvery important to explain the behavior of the conductance spectra at low energy. We will show that in DSC\nstate the d-wave P-H pairing(DWCB) and the extended\ns-wave P-P pairing(PDW) can explain the low energy\nspectra while the solution with other symmetries cannot\nsufficiently match the experimental results.\n\nFIG. 7: The amplitudes, \u22060 , \u22061 , and W0 of \u2206DSC (r),\n\u2206PDW (r), and WDWCB (r), respectively, as a function of the\nmodulation long range interaction V1 . t = 125 meV is chosen\nto have the amplitudes in units of meV. For a d-wave superconducting order (DSC), \u22060 , denoted by x along the curve\nfor DSC, at each V1 represents the mean value of \u2206DSC (r)\nwhich is slightly modulated.\n\nIn section II, we have shown that, even without PDW,\nthe presence of DWCB and DSC orders in a pseudogap\nstate can capture the features of the Fermi arc. To understand the temperature dependence of the length of\nthe Fermi arc above Tc we assumed the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the energy \u03b7 in the\nGreen function implicitly. Using the results of the selfconsistent calculations, this assumption of the temperature dependence of \u03b7 is not necessary. The presence of\nthe complementary connected d-wave orders in P-P and\nthe extended s-wave order in P-H channels with DSC order naturally lead us to the temperature dependence of\nthe length of the Fermi arc within the Franz and Millis\nmodel32 .\n\n\f10\ncalculation are given in meV, and \u03b4h is the height of \u03c1(\u03c9)\nat \u03c9 = 0 off of the superconducting DOS displayed in a\ndashed line in Fig. 8.\nV1\n0.4t\n0.6t\n0.8t\n1.0t\n\n\u2206DSC \u2206PDW WDWCB\n33.0 12.7\n3.3\n35.7 19.9\n9.9\n39.6 27.5\n13.0\n44.2 35.6\n16.1\n\n\u03b4h\n0.0599\n0.1125\n0.1445\n0.1546\n\n(55)\n\nFor the extended s-wave P-H and d-wave P-P channel\norders, we have used V0 = 2.5t and V1 as in (56), where\nWSWCB denotes the extended s-wave P-H pairing for convenience.\nV1\n0.4t\n0.6t\n0.8t\n1.0t\nFIG. 8: (a) The averaged DOS are plotted for \u2206DSC = 33\nmeV in the case of d-wave P-H and extended s-wave P-P\nchannel orders: \u2206PDW = 12.7 meV, WDWCB = 3.3 meV.

It captures the experimental\nobservation of conductance spectrum at both low and\nhigh energy. As expected, the d-wave symmetry of the\nP-H pairing density order has little effect at low energy\nwhile it strongly affects the superconducting coherence\npeaks. Therefore we can conclude the competing order\nin the P-H channel must have d-wave symmetry. Due to\nthe complementary connection in the orders in P-H and\nP-P channels, it naturally lead to the existence of the\npair density order that has extended s-wave symmetry.\nIn Fig. 8, to illustrate the above argument, we plotted\nthe averaged DOS in two cases: (a) d-wave P-H and extended s-wave P-P channel orders, and (b) s-wave P-H\nand extended d-wave P-P channel orders in the d-wave\nsuperconducting state (\u2206DSC = 33meV).\n\nB.\n\nThe DWCB and PDW in the pseudogap state\n\nNow let us consider the spectral function A(k, \u03c9) in the\npseudogap state to capture the features in the Fermi arc.\nFirst we rewrite the mean-field Hamiltonian for PDW\nand DWCB in momentum space.

As\n\u03c9 increases(from top to bottom), the scattering wavevectors\nconnecting one tip of the green curve to another tip decrease.\nHowever, in (b) the gapless region remains unchanged as \u03c9\nincreases, that is, the Fermi arc is non-dispersive.\n\nwhere \u03c9 \u2032 is the energy shift due to the presence of a\nuniform supercurrent, and P (\u03c9 \u2032 ) is the probability distribution of \u03c9 \u2032 calculated within a 2D XY model as such\n\u221a\n\u20322\n2\nP (\u03c9 \u2032 ) = 2\u03c0W (T )e\u2212\u03c9 /2W (T )\n(65)\nwhere W (T ) is an order of pseudogap and an increasing\nfunction of temperature above Tc .\nNow we will study the energy dependence of the Fermi\narc in the pseudogap state. One of the salient features\nof the pseudogap phase is that the Fermi arc is nondispersive, whereas it is dispersive in the superconducting\nphase. The Fermi arc along the Fermi surface is identified by the peak of EDC at \u03c9 = 0. Fig. 9(b) demonstrates that the Fermi arc in green remains unchanged\nas \u03c9 is increased. In the superconducting state, however,\nthe gapless region develops as the energy decreases below\nthe Fermi level as seen in Fig. 9(a).\nWhile the Fermi arc is non-dispersive, it is found that\nthe length of it is increasing linearly as a function of temperature30 . Within the model of Franz and Millis, when\nT > Tc , W (T ) is an approximately linearly increasing\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 10: The temperature dependence of the Femi arc above Tc . (a) EDC's along the Fermi surface from the nodal point (top)\nto anti-nodal point (bottom) are plotted.

(b) The Fermi arc as a function of the temperature T\nat above Tc .\n\nfunction when the order parameters remain fixed. Adopting the values of W (T ) above Tc , we have calculated\nA(k, \u03c9) as a function of temperature.\n\nIn Fig. 10(a), EDC are plotted from the nodal to antinodal point along the Fermi surface. Clearly it shows a\ngapless nodal point and gapped anti-nodal point as indicated by darker curves. But, contrary to a superconducting state where the Fermi surface is gapped except\nat the nodal point, there is a region, the so called Fermi\narc, where peaks still survive at \u03c9 = 0 and thus the\nsuperconducting gap is closed. The curve on top is the\nEDC at the nodal point, (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), perpendicular to the\nFermi surface. It is manifest that the size of the arrows\nis increasing as the temperature rises. Fig. 10(b) shows\nthe Fermi arc in the first Brillouin zone. As in the Fig. 9\nthe green color represents the gapless region of the Fermi\nsurface, that is, the Fermi arc.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented a detailed analysis of competing orders in cuprates which explains the checkerboard pattern\nobserved in STM spectra. We have shown that in general\nthere is a complementary connection between the orders\nin the P-P and the P-H channels in both the superconducting state and the pseudogap state. The symmetries\nof the orders in both channels are closely related to each\nother. In the d-wave superconducting state, the presence of the d-wave(extended s-wave) P-H density order\nimplies the coexistence of the extended s-wave(d-wave)\nP-P pairing order. The self-consistent calculations in the\ndisordered superconducting state result in solutions with\nuniform d-wave superconducting order, a P-H channel\ncheckerboard density order with the order wavevector Q,\nand a P-P channel pairing density wave with the same\nQ. The symmetries of the channel orders is crucial to\nthe effects on the density of states in STM experiments.\nWe have found that d-wave checkerboard density order\nin the P-P and the extended s-wave pair density wave\nare in good agreement with the experimental data in the\n\n\f13\nsuperconducting phase.\nThe coexistence of orders in both P-P and P-H channels are important to understand the pseudogap phase\nwhich can be considered as a state which maintains pairing amplitude without phase coherence. The fluctuation\nof phase would naturally lead to the DWCB and PDW\norders. We have shown that the presence of DWCB and\nPDW results in a non-dispersive Fermi arc and our calculations show the linear dependence of the length of the\nFermi arc at temperatures above Tc . Moreover, the effect of the presence of PDW and DWCB on single particle\nspectra is much larger in the antinodal direction than in\nthe nodal direction. These results also explain the dichotomy between the nodal and antinodal single particle\nspectra in the cuprates.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n18\n\nS.-C.

From our results in this paper, the low energy effective theory should include both orders. So far,\nmost theories have treated them independently. It is also\nclear that the presence of both orders can result in new\nphysics in transport and thermal properties. A detailed\nstudy of these effects will be reported elsewhere.\nAcknowledgement: J.
