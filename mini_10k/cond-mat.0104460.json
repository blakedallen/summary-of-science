K. Sunko\nDepartment of Physics, Faculty of Science, Bijeni\u010dka 32, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe parameter regime in which a Brinkmann-Rice (BR) transition appears near\nhalf-filling is investigated for a model of of one kind of electrons traversing a\nplane randomly tiled with CuO4 molecules, simulating the copper-oxide planes\nof high-Tc superconductors. As the hole doping is increased, the BR transition\nevolves continuously into a state characterized by Kauzmann-like plateaus in\nthe entropy vs. temperature curves. Despite clear analogies with the glass\ntransition, these are equilibrium properties of the model. This is because the spin\ninteractions, responsible for ordering in real space, are not included.\n\nIntroduction. One difficulty in describing the metal-insulator transition,\ncaused by strong electron repulsion, is that there is no obvious classical solution in the limit of infinite repulsion. This is in contrast to 'strong-coupling'\nproblems with attractive interactions, which are difficult when the coupling is\ncompetitive with the hopping scale, but simplify when it becomes much greater.\nLike some other approaches, saddle-point slave-boson [1] and dynamical\nmean-field theory [2], the random-tiling (RT) model [3] tries to get around\nthis problem by simply postulating a 'heavy mode'. The RT heavy mode is\nessentially the one proposed by Gutzwiller: electrons of one spin see those of\nthe other as static. This is implemented as a Falicov-Kimball limit of the threeband Emery model, in which only up-electrons move, by projected hopping.\nThere are no spin interactions in the model. The parameters are the hopping\noverlap t and copper-oxygen splitting \u2206pd .\nBrinkmann-Rice regime. Here I concentrate on the limit t \u226a \u2206pd , which\nwas identified in Ref. [3] as having a crossover of Brinkmann-Rice [4] type.\nThe novelty is in what happens when one moves away from half-filling. In\nFig. (1.1), I show the entropy of the mobile spins. There appear saturation\n1\n\n\f2\nplateaus, reminiscent of Kauzmann plateaus [5] in vitreous liquids. One of\nthe curves even exhibits a 'Kauzmann paradox', extrapolation from the hightemperature part yielding a negative entropy at low temperatures. Entropy\nsaturation due to 'freezing' of kinetic motion was also observed in 3 He, and\neven modelled by the Hubbard model [6].\n1.0\nn=1.5\n\nS\u2191[kB]\n0.8\n\nt=0.25 eV\n\nn=1.8\nn=1.5\n\nn=1.2\n\nn=1.2\n\nn=1.0\n\nn=1.0\n\n0.6\n\nt=0.5 eV\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nT [K]\n\nFigure 1.1 Entropy of mobile spins, for t = 0.25 eV (left three curves), and t = 0.5 eV (right\nfour curves). Curves are marked by the corresponding concentration. Saturation plateaus are\nclearly visible. Here \u2206pd = 3 eV, U = 10 eV, and n = 2n\u2191 = 2n\u2193 .\n\nThe value of the entropy at the plateaus corresponds to complete static\ndisorder of the tiles, so it is the maximum one-band entropy, the rise beyond\nbeing due to the oxygen degrees of freedom. These play a role analogous to\nclassical translation in the case of 3 He. Once the rise occurs, the oxygen gas\nrapidly becomes Maxwellian (the chemical potential moves out of the effective\nband). The plateaus signal 'pseudogaps' in the system density of states. The\nsingle-particle model on which the problem is mapped reflects this by a very\nnarrow effective band for the parameters in question, so the Maxwellian regime\ncorresponds to the temperature becoming comparable to this effective bandwidth. The input parameters, as shown, are still on the usual 'electron' scale,\nindicating strong model renormalization when t/\u2206pd < 1/5. The effective\none-particle density of states shows no pseudogaps.\nFor realistically large values of the hopping overlap, e.g. t = 1 eV for\n\u2206pd = 3 eV, the entropy has a fairly smooth 'metallic' rise at finite fillings,\nand there is no Brinkmann-Rice regime near half-filling, either.\n\nDiscussion. The Brinkmann-Rice 'transition' in the RT model is the endpoint of a continuous range of glass-like crossovers, tuned by doping. The\nmodel interpolation, between quantum order at low temperatures and classical\n\n\fEntropy saturation and the Brinkmann-Rice transition in a random-tiling model\n\n3\n\ndisorder at high ones, is not smooth in this parameter regime, despite the input\nt/\u2206pd being fairly large, though smaller than suggested by experiment.\nThe expression 'glass-like' is used only conditionally, to describe the shape\nof the entropy curves. In the absence of spin interactions, there is no spatially\nordered state of lower free energy, even at half-filling. In fact, the RT MottHubbard transition occurs slightly below half-filling, immediately producing\na less ordered state [7]. This tendency of charge correlations to disorder the\nsystem, presumably counteracting spin correlations on the hole-doped side, is\none of the more interesting aspects of the RT model.\nExperimentally, a pseudogap can be noticed in the temperature dependence\nof the entropy of LSCO [8]. For underdoped systems, the curve is first flat,\nthen rises, so that extrapolation from the high-temperature part indicates a\ndisappearance of states at the Fermi level. However, the parameter regime\nneeded to obtain the observed values of the entropy in the RT model is the\nabove-mentioned realistic one, t/\u2206pd \u223c 1/3, where the entropy curves are\nsmooth, not like the ones shown here. This discrepancy of qualitative and\nquantitative fits is probably due to the overly simplistic Falicov-Kimball limit.\n\nAcknowledgements. Conversations with S. Bari\u0161i\u0107 and E.
