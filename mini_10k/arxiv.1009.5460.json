The previously reported dielectric study on\nthis compound shows an anomalous behavior close to the charge ordered transition temperature.9\nIn the present study, we have investigated the dielectric behavior of La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.1,\n0.3, and 0.4) series, exhibiting varying magnetic ground states. Previously reported neutron\ndiffraction studies on these compounds show the CE \u2013 type antiferromagnetic structure is stable\nfor x < 0.3.17,18 At x = 0.3, CE \u2013 type ordering coexists with an A \u2013 type antiferromagnetic phase.\nAt x = 0.4, A \u2013 type antiferromagnetic order replaces the CE \u2013 type state. Evidence of long range\nferromagnetic ordering in the temperature range of 180 \u2013 250K is observed only in case of x =\n0.4 sample. All the compounds having x \u2264 0.4 exhibit an insulating behavior.\n\n2\n\n\fEXPERIMENT\nThe polycrystalline samples were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction route\nand the method preparation has been reported elsewhere.17 Temperature dependent dielectric\nmeasurements were carried out using Novocontrol alpha impedance analyzer in the frequency\nrange of 100Hz to 5MHz, with rms ac voltage of 1V. Samples in the form of pellets were\nsandwiched between the electrodes of Novocontrol BDS1200 sample cell. The sample\ntemperature was varied between 293K and 123K using the Quatro cryosystem with liquid\nnitrogen for cooling.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe structural and magnetic phase diagram for La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (0.1 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5) series\nobtained from unpolarized neutron diffraction study has been reported previously.17 We have\nobserved that with progressive increase in Sr doping the CE \u2013 type antiferromagnetic phase is\nsuppressed and ferromagnetic phase is favored. The CE \u2013 type antiferromagnetic phase is\nobserved for x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 samples with antiferromagnetic transition temperatures 150,\n100, and 75K, respectively. At x = 0.4, the CE \u2013 type antiferromagnetic structure is fully\nsuppressed and A \u2013 type antiferromagnetic phase is observed with the transition temperature TN\n= 200K. Further increase in Sr doping at x = 0.5, the long range ordered ferromagnetic phase is\nestablished for all temperatures below 310K. Structurally, the Sr doped samples having x \u2264 0.3\ncrystallize with orthorhombic structure (space group Pnma) and x = 0.4 crystallizes with two\northorhombic phases in the space group Pnma and Fmmm. In the present study, we have chosen\na few representative compounds from La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4) series having\ndistinct magnetic structures. In figure 1(a) magnetization as a function of temperature M(T), for\n3\n\n\fx = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 samples is displayed.17 All the three samples exhibit magnetic transitions\nattributable to the onset of charge ordering (TCO), ferromagnetic (TC), and antiferromagnetic (TN)\nstates, similar to x = 0 sample.19 Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of real part of\nrelative permittivity \u03b5\u2032(T) for all the three samples at frequency ~ 12kHz. For x = 0.1 and 0.3\nsamples with CE \u2013 type antiferromagnetic state, the \u03b5\u2032(T) exhibits a maximum at 230 and 280K,\nrespectively. This maximum coincides with the maximum in M(T), evident in figure 1. Similar\nbehavior of \u03b5\u2032(T) having a maximum close to TCO is observed in x = 0 9 and other charge ordered\nmanganites.20-22 The charge ordering transition in these compounds is found to be accompanied\nby a structural transition from orthorhombic phase having space group Pnma to a lower\nsymmetry monoclinic phase with P21/m space group. This space group accounts for the two\ninequivalent sites for Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, which are created as a result of charge ordering\nleading to higher distorted octahedra. The presence of Jahn Teller lattice distortions in addition\nto strong electron phonon interactions lead to a canting instability of antiferromagnetic state.\nThis behavior favors formation of spin dimers that drives charge ordering from site centered to\nbond centered which leads to the appearance of ferroelectric properties in charge ordered\nmanganites.10 In these samples, using diffuse neutron scattering studies we have found evidence\nof short range ordering at temperatures above TCO.18 The short range ordering is found to grow\non lowering of temperatures and is suppressed below the magnetic ordering temperatures. The\nshallow maximum in \u03b5\u2032(T) for T > TC correlates with this. The x = 0.4 sample exhibits an A \u2013\ntype antiferromagnetic state and ferromagnetic phase in the intermediate temperature range of\n180 \u2013 250K. The variation of \u03b5\u2032(T) exhibits a strong temperature dependence for T > 200K, close\nto the ferromagnetic transition and its value becomes negative (not shown in the figure) above\n250K. This behavior is significantly different as compared to x = 0.1 and 0.3 samples.\n4\n\n\fAdditionally, in antiferromagnetic state the absolute value of \u03b5\u2032 is higher in case of x = 0.4\nsample indicating the influence of nature of magnetic ordering on \u03b5\u2032. The dielectric response\nclose to the transition temperature may be correlated with competing ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic interactions present near the transition temperature. This behavior is in\nagreement with earlier reported polarized neutron scattering study on these samples, where\nmagnetic polarons of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic nature coexist above the transition\ntemperatures.18 Magnetic field dependent dielectric study on La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 system reveals the\ninfluence of phase separated state on the dielectric behavior near the magnetic transitions.15 The\ntemperature dependence of imaginary part of relative permittivity, \u03b5\u2032\u2032(T), is shown in the inset to\nfigure 1(b). The primary contribution to \u03b5\u2032\u2032 is governed by dc conductivity (\u03c3dc) and is expressed\nas \u03b5\u2032\u2032 = \u03c3dc/\u03c9 \u03b50, where \u03c9 is the angular frequency and \u03b50 is the dielectric permittivity of free\nspace. At frequency \u03c9 \u2248 12kHz, for Sr doping at x = 0.1 the \u03b5\u2032\u2032(T) exhibit a rise with increasing\ntemperature. This behavior is consistent with earlier reported transport studies, wherein\nconductivity increases with increasing temperature. For higher Sr substitution (x = 0.3 and 0.4),\n\u03b5\u2032\u2032(T) shows similar temperature dependence. At a given temperature, as a function of Sr doping,\nenhancement in \u03b5\u2032\u2032(x) indicate the favoring of metallic behavior, in corroboration with transport\nstudy. Figure 2 shows the Argand plane plots (imaginary part of impedance (Z\u2032\u2032) versus real part\nof impedance (Z\u2032)) for La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.4) at 123K. One single semicircle\nhas been observed for all three samples in frequency range of 100Hz \u2013 1MHz. The size of the\nsemi circle is dependent upon the size and number of grains present in the sample, while the\ndiameter of semicircle corresponds to resistance from the grains.23,24 The presence of single semi\ncircle in the studied frequency range for all three samples corresponds to intra grain contribution\nto conductivity. As a function of Sr doping, the diameter of the semicircle reduces. The large\n5\n\n\fdecrease in diameter with composition indicates the reduction in resistivity from grains and\nincrease in conductivity, which is in agreement with our previously reported dc resistivity\nstudies.17 In figure 3, \u03b5\u2032 as a function of frequency \u03b5\u2032(\u03bd), for x = 0.1 sample at several\ntemperatures is shown. The frequency dependence of \u03b5\u2032 can be described by Debye equation\nexpressed as,25\n\u03b5\u2032 = \u03b5 \u221e +\n\n\u03b5s \u2212 \u03b5 \u221e\n1 + (i\u03c9\u03c4)1\u2212\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, \u03b5\u221e and \u03b5s are the respective value of relative permittivity at high and low frequency, \u03c9 is\nthe angular frequency, \u03b1 is a measure of the distribution of relaxation time and \u03c4 is relaxation\ntime. The thermal dependence of \u03c4 is Arrhenius type, \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(EA/kBT), where \u03c40 is a constant\nand EA is the activation energy. The fit at various temperatures for x = 0.1 sample is shown in\nfigure 3. The relaxation time \u03c4 is obtained by fitting \u03b5\u2032(\u03bd) to equation (1) and is plotted as a\nfunction of 1000/T in figure 4 for x = 0.1compound. It is evident in figure 4 that \u03c4 obeys\nArrhenius law in the temperature regime of 123 \u2013 253K. The fitting parameters obtained are EA \u2248\n0.12eV and \u03c40 \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10-9s. Similar to x = 0.1 sample, for x = 0.3 sample the frequency\ndependence of \u03b5\u2032 could be described by equation 1. Figure 5 shows the relaxation time \u03c4 versus\n1000/T along with Arrhenius fitting for x = 0.3 sample in the range of 123 \u2013 203K. The obtained\nfitting parameters are, EA \u2248 0.121eV and \u03c40 \u2248 6.03 \u00d7 10-11s, showing no significant change in\ncomparison with x = 0.1 sample. A similar analysis for x = 0.4 could not be carried out because\nof the negative values of \u03b5\u2032(\u03bd) in several temperature range. Negative capacitances (and therefore\ndielectric constants) have been observed in similar systems26 and has been primarily attributed\nto delocalization of trapped carriers. Additional effects like contacts, interfaces, space charge etc.\nmay also lead to negative capacitances. In the case of x=0.4, the conductivity at low temperatures\n6\n\n\fis highly enhanced as compared to charge ordered x=0.1 and 0.3 compositions. Under the\napplication of an electric field the carriers hop between localized states and cause an inductive\neffect giving rise to negative capacitances. In a dielectric measurement the net capacitance is a\nsum of effect from the bulk and surface13 which may be represented by an equivalent circuit of\nresistances and capacitances. The observations at any given temperature and frequency is\ntherefore a complex combination of effects from these four elements. The negative values of \u03b5\u2032\nobserved in the case of x=0.4 above the transition temperature (figure 1) indicates the reduction\nin the effects from the bulk and domination of surface effects. This is particularly true in\nmeasurements with low frequency which is the case in the present measurement. The value of EA\nfor x = 0.1 and 0.3 samples are in agreement with previous reports on similar half doped\nR0.5Ca0.5MnO3 (R = Dy, Er and Tb)12,27 and Bi doped LaMnO3 compounds.28 The value of\nactivation energy is much smaller in comparison to typical ferroelectrics and dielectric such as\nPb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) where EA \u2248 0.9eV.29 Inset to figures 4 and 5 show the temperature\ndependence of real part of relative permittivity \u03b5\u2032(T) at various frequencies for x = 0.1 and 0.3\nsamples, respectively. The \u03b5\u2032(T) exhibits a maximum in the range of 180 \u2013 280K, which\ncoincides with the maximum in M(T) (as shown in figure 1). On increasing the frequency, \u03b5\u2032\ndecreases significantly with the maximum shifting to higher temperature. At 12kHz, maximum\nvalue of \u03b5\u2032 for x = 0.1 compound is 320, which is reduced to 225 at 1MHz. Similar to x = 0.1,\n\u03b5\u2032(T) for x = 0.3 sample displays a maximum at ~ 280K, with slight dependence on frequency.\nThe maximum value of relative permittivity at 12kHz is 277. It is observed that value of \u03b5\u2032 varies\nmarkedly with frequency; however the position of a broad peak described above show a small\nchange with frequency. The \u03b5\u2032 values are a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic effects. The\nintrinsic contribution is due to the material's bulk response, observed at medium and high\n7\n\n\ffrequencies. The extrinsic contribution to \u03b5\u2032 is associated with interfacial polarization produced\nin grain boundaries and sample-electrode contacts. The extrinsic factors mainly contribute at low\nfrequencies. Equation (1) describes the low temperature behavior but not the presence of\nmaximum at ~ TCO. This maximum is observed at higher frequencies as well. Therefore, the\npresence of maximum in \u03b5\u2032(T) cannot be attributed to extrinsic factors, and must have intrinsic\norigin. In figure 6 the imaginary part of relative permittivity \u03b5\u2032\u2032 as a function of frequency for x =\n0.1 sample at several temperatures is shown. This figure is representative for all the samples\nhaving x \u2264 0.4. The \u03b5\u2032\u2032 shows a rather high value at low frequencies, which decreases with\nincreasing frequency and decreasing temperature. This behavior is in agreement with earlier\nreports.9 The \u03b5\u2032\u2032 for a given frequency shows a decrease with increasing temperature, indicating\nthe reduction in \u03c3dc. In the inset to figure 6 the frequency dependence of imaginary part of\nrelative permittivity \u03b5\u2032\u2032 for La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.4) samples at 123K is\ndisplayed. As a function of Sr doping at 123K the \u03b5\u2032\u2032 shows an increase. This behavior is in\nagreement with dc resistivity studies reported earlier wherein reduction in resistivity with Sr\ndoping is evident. Figure 7 displays the Argand plane plots for x = 0.1 compound at various\ntemperatures. Similar behavior in Argand plane plot with varying temperature is displayed for x\n= 0.3 and 0.4 samples. For these samples, single large arc is observed in the temperature range of\n123K \u2264 T \u2264 293K. This indicates that in this temperature interval and frequency range only\nintrinsic response is observed. For La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 compound, the intrinsic effects are reported to\nplay an important role in dielectric response.9 The decrease in size and diameter of the semicircle\nwith increasing temperature reflects the reduction in resistivity of grains.\n\n8\n\n\fCONCLUSION\nThe dielectric response of polycrystalline La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (0.1 \u2264 x \u2264 0.4) samples with\ndifferent magnetic ground state has been studied. It exhibits a maximum coinciding with the\nmaximum observed in M(T) indicating a coupling between the magnetic properties and electric\nfields. The position of maximum shows slight dependence on frequency. In the antiferromagnetic\nstate the absolute value of \u03b5\u2032 increases with x. The composition (x = 0.4) with A \u2013 type\nantiferromagnetic ordering is found to have a higher \u03b5\u2032 as compared to samples with CE \u2013 type\nordering despite a higher conductivity in the case of x = 0.4. The frequency dependence of \u03b5\u2032 is\ndescribed by Debye equation. The obtained values of EA ~ 0.12eV and do not show significant\nchange with Sr doping up to x \u2264 0.3, while \u03c4 is in the range 2.8\u00d710-9 \u2013 6.03\u00d710-11 s.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure captions\n\nFigure 1.
