M. Chen, Y. Luo, Q. Qin, J. Q. Wang, S. Wang, G. Xu, C. H. Yu, C. Zhang,\nIHEP, Beijing 100039, China\nAbstract\nThe Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC) has\nbeen running for both high energy physics (HEP) and\nsynchrotron radiation (SR) researches since 1989. Good\nperformance of BEPC accomplishes a lot of achievements\nin the \u03c4-charm region over the past decade, and in many\nfields of SR applications as well. As an upgrading scheme\nfrom BEPC, the BEPCII project was approved by the\nChinese government in the early time of this year, with a\nmicro-\u03b2 scheme and multi-bunch collision in a doublering machine installed in the current BEPC tunnel. The\ndesign work of the BEPCII is being carried on. This paper\nwill describe the main progresses on the design of the\nBEPCII in the field of accelerator physics.\n\n1 BEAM-BEAM INTERACTION\nTo achieve the high luminosity in the factory class\ncollider, high beam currents and small beam sizes are\nnecessary. These induce a strong beam-beam interaction.\nThe successful performance of KEKB and PEPII\nindicates that the beam-beam limit can be reached without\nany single bunch instability. This means the beam-beam\ninteraction limits the peak luminosity. It is an important\nissue to study the beam-beam interaction in the design\nand performance of such a high luminosity collider.\nThe simulation studies are done by taking the\nadvantages of the code BBC (Beam-Beam interaction\nwith a Crossing angle) developed by K. Hirata [1]. BBC\nis a weak-strong simulation code in 6-D phase space,\nincluding the effect of crossing angle. Although the weak\nstrong simulation can not investigate the coherent\nphenomena of beam-beam interaction, it is generally used\nduring the design of a collider. Because of the CPU time\nconsuming, the strong-strong simulation in a large scale\ntune scan so far has not yet been done.\nThe effect of a finite bunch length is taken into account\nby dividing a strong bunch into 5 slices longitudinally,\nand the weak one is represented by 50 randomly\ngenerated super particles, with a Gaussian distribution in\n6-D phase space. The simulation is done for more than 5\nradiation damping time.\nThe tune scan is performed for optimizing the tune\nfrom the viewpoint of high luminosity. Figure 1 shows\nthe simulated luminosity on the tune grid (fractional part\nonly) of \u03b4\u03bdx \u2208 (0,1) and \u03b4\u03bdy \u2208 (0,1) with a crossing angle\nof \u03c6c= 11 mrad \u03042, in which the luminosity reduction\nfactor L/L0 is given instead of the luminosity itself. The\nmesh size is set as 0.02, which is smaller than the\nsynchrotron tune \u03bds =0.034. It indicates that the high\nluminosity region is just above the half integer in\nhorizontal plane, and there is no significant difference\n\nbetween just above half integer and just above the integer\nin vertical plane. According to the commissioning\nexperiences of KEKB and PEPII [2], a vertical tune above\nhalf integer is preferable because the orbit distortion is\nmuch stable than that of above an integer. The high\nluminosity is expected at around \u03b4\u03bdx=0.53 and \u03b4\u03bdy=0.58,\nand these tune values are set as the design working points.\nTo achieve higher luminosity, a larger beam-beam\nparameter \u03bey is preferable. However, the maximum \u03bey is\nlimited by beam-beam interaction. The simulation results\nshow that the maximum \u03bey is decreased because of the\nlarge crossing angle of \u03c6c=11 mrad \u03042, but the design\nvalue of \u03bey = 0.04 is reasonable and reachable.\nFor BEPCII, the crossing angle of \u03c6c=11 mrad \u03042 is the\nbasic requirements of the interaction region. From the\nviewpoint of beam-beam interaction, the crossing angle\nnot only limits the maximum \u03bey, as described above, but\nalso induces some additional luminosity reductions due to\nthe geometric effects. The simulation shows that the\nluminosity reduction factor due to the finite bunch length\neffect and the crossing angle is about 80% while the\nluminosity reduction factor is 86% for the head-on\ncollision. However, the crossing angle of \u03c6c = 11 mrad \u03042\nis still acceptable. The simulation also indicates that the\nbunch length should be controlled carefully to avoid\nfurther luminosity reduction due to the finite bunch length\neffect.\n\nFigure 1: Luminosity survey with a crossing angle of\n\u03c6c= 11 mrad \u03042\n\n2 LATTICE DESIGN OF THE BEPCII\nSTORAGE RING\nWith a new inner ring installed inside the old one in the\nexisting BEPC tunnel, BEPCII will provide the colliding\n\n\fbeams with the center-of-mass energy from 1.0 GeV\u00d72 to\n2.1 GeV\u00d72 and also the dedicated synchrotron radiation\nbeam at 2.5 GeV. For the colliding beams the luminosity\nis optimized at 1.89 GeV with the peak luminosity of\n1\u00d71033 cm-2s-1. As to the dedicated synchrotron radiation\nmode, the beam current reaches 250 mA with an\nemittance as low as possible.\nThere have been several beam-lines in the BEPC for the\nsynchrotron radiation experiments, so the current bending\nmagnets and insertion devices in the southern region have\nto be fixed at their present positions. In order to increase\nthe average luminosity, the \"top-off\" injection scheme up\nto 1.89 GeV is adopted. This requires that the injection\nand collision optics be the same. The main parameters of\nthe storage ring for both collision and SR modes are\nshown in Table 1.\nTable 1 Main Parameters of the BEPCII storage ring\nParameters\nUnit\nCollision\nSR\nEnergy\nGeV\n1.89\n2.5\nCircumference\nm\n237.53\n241.13\nRF frequency\nMHz\n499.8\n499.8\nHarmonic\n396\n402\nRF voltage\nMV\n1.5\n3.0\n6.53/7.58\n8.28/5.18\nTransverse tunes\n6.53/5.58\nDamping time\nms\n25/25/12.5 12/12/6\nBeam current\nA\n0.91\n0.25\nBunch number\n93\nMulti\nSR loss per turn\nkeV\n121\n336\nSR power\nkW\n110\n84\nEnergy spread\n5.16\u00d710-4\n6.66\u00d710-4\nCompact factor\n0.0235\n0.016\nBunch length\ncm\n1.5\n1.18\n120/\nEmittance\nnm\u22c5rad 144/2.2\nm\n1/0.015\n\u03b2 function at IP\n\u2212\nCrossing angle\nmrad\n11\u00d7 2\n\u2212\nBunch spacing\nm\n2.4\n\u2212\nBeam-beam Parameter\n0.04/0.04\n\u2212\nLuminosity\ncm-2s-1 1.0\u00d71033\n\u2212\n\n2.1 Geometric Design\nBeing upgraded from BEPC, BEPCII will use the old\ntunnel and keep the present beam-lines, so that the\ncircumferences of \"three rings\" (two horizontally\nseparated colliding rings and an SR ring) and the distance\nbetween the outer and inner rings are only adjustable in a\nfew tens of centimeters. The RF frequency of the\ncolliding rings is constrained by the linac frequency and\nthe demands of the harmonic number from the data\nacquisition system of the BESIII detector. The final\nchoice of the RF frequency is 499.8 MHz, which is 7/40\nof the linac frequency 2856 MHz. Corresponding to this\nfrequency, the harmonic numbers for the colliding and SR\nrings are 396 and 402, respectively. The distance between\nthe outer and inner rings is 1.18 m. The north half ring of\nBEPC must be shifted 0.36 m northward.\n\nDue to the space limit, the only way to separate the two\nbeams is to use the crossing angle at the interaction point\n(IP). The crossing angle of BEPCII is chosen as 11 mrad\n\u00d7 2. Since the crossing angle cannot give a sufficient\nseparation, the first pair of defocusing quadrupoles of the\nIR will deflect the beams further to 26 mrad \u00d7 2 and then\na pair of septum magnets deflects the beam in the inner\nrings to 65.5 mrad, avoiding the SR background in the IR\nin the meantime. A bridge is needed in the SR mode\nconnect the two half outer rings. Two superconducting\ndipole coils on both sides of the IP are used to accomplish\nthis function. The beam will have 6 mm horizontal offset\nat the bending coils for the SR mode. In the RF region,\nthe crossing angle of the particle trajectories is 154.7\nmrad\u00d72. Vertical local bumps will be used to separate two\nbeams, so that the optics of two rings can be symmetric.\nIn the operation of the SR mode, the bridges, which\nconnect the inner and outer rings, will be powered off.\nThus, the electron beam will go straight through the\nbending magnets. In this case, both of the RF cavities can\nprovide the power to the electron beam.

Many equipment\nincluding magnets, beam diagnostic instruments, masks,\nvacuum pumps, and experiment detector must coexist in a\nvery small region. So the most difficult part of the design\nof a new collider is that of the IR.\nThe IR of BEPCII is about \u00b114 m long from the IP, in\nwhich about 20 main magnets need to be installed. The\nspace is very tight. The design criteria for the BEPCII IR\nconfiguration are based on the experiences from other\nmachines and some special requirements of the BEPCII.\nThe two beams collide at the IP with a horizontal crossing\nangle of 22 mrad. The IR configuration provides an\neffective compensation scheme of high field detector\nsolenoid. The aperture of vacuum chamber in the IR must\n\n\fbe designed at least 2\u00d7(14\u03c3 +2 mm) for the beams\n(uncoupled in the horizontal plane and fully coupled in\nthe vertical plane). And the background level of both\nsynchrotron radiation and lost particles in the detector\nmust be sufficiently low.\nThe BESIII detector consists of a cylindrical drift\nchamber, surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter,\nwhich is immersed in about 1 T magnetic field of a 3.7 m\nlong superconducting solenoid. The geometry of the drift\nchamber requires that the accelerator components inside\nthe detector should fit the conical space with an opening\nangle of 21.5 \u030a. The first accelerator component, which\nfollows the central drift chamber, can only approach to\n0.552 m on each side of the IP. The superconducting\nmagnet SCQ and the septum bend magnet ISPB are fully\nlocated inside the detector boundary. The schematic\nlayout of the IR is shown in Fig 3.\n\nR3I\n\nR4I\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n83\n0.\n\n\u03b8\n\nQ1a\n\nISPB\n\nQSC\n\nQSC\n\nISPB\n\n93\n0.\n\nQ1b\n\n=\n\ne-\n\n\u03b8\n\nIQ2\n\nQ1a\n\nQ1b\n\ne+\n\nIQ2\n\nIP\n\nOQ2\n\ne+\n\ne-\n\nOQ2\n\nFigure 3: Schematic layout of the IR\nIn order to avoid the parasitic bunch crossing, a quick\nbeam separation after collision is necessary. Our design\nchoice is to introduce a horizontal crossing angle of 2\u00d711\nmrad at the IP and to incorporate with a horizontal\nbending magnet labeled ISPB for a larger separation\nbetween e\u2212 and e+ beams. The ISPB is a septum magnet\nwith a narrow septum coil, located at 2.3 m away from the\nIP with a length of 0.6 m and the field strength of 4.6 kGs.\nIt acts on the outgoing beam only.\nOn each side of the IP, a doublet of quadrupoles on\neach beam-line is used to provide the focusing optics\nneeded at the IP (\u03b2y*=1.5 cm). The first vertical focusing\nquadrupole is a superconducting magnet (SCQ) shared by\nboth beams. The SCQ package also includes\ncompensation solenoid magnets, dipole magnets for SR\nmode and skew quadrupole coils. Its cryostat has a warm\nbore with an inner diameter of \u03c6134 mm and an outer\ndiameter of \u03c6302 mm. The endcan of the cryostat has an\nouter diameter of \u03c6635 mm. The second elements of the\ndoublets are horizontal focusing quadrupoles Q1a and\nQ1b with a distance of 0.3m between them. In order to\nkeep the symmetry for the two rings and save the space,\nQ1a and Q1b are designed as a two-in-one structure and\ntwo separated beam channels for the incoming and\noutgoing beams with the same field strengths. These\nquadrupoles have to meet some special difficulties in\ndesign because the two beam pipes at their positions are\nstill very close to each other. The next machine elements\n\nare quadrupoles Q2, Q3 and Q4, where the sufficient\nseparation of the two beams is available to allow them to\nbe installed side by side in the two rings. Those\nquadrupoles match the IR optics to that of the arc region.\n\n2.3 Optics Design of the Collision Mode\nThe double-ring geometric structure of BEPCII causes\neach ring not to be a 4-fold symmetric structure, but the\nelectron and positron rings are symmetric while the SR\nring is east-west symmetric. Each ring for collision can be\ndivided into four regions: IR, arc, injection, and RF\nregions.\nIn the IR region, two superconducting quadrupole\n(SCQ) are located at both sides of the IP to squeeze the\n\u03b2y*. It also bends the beams further from 11 mrad to 26\nmrad. 5 warm bore quadrupoles are used for connecting\nthe arc and IP. A low field bending magnet is located at\nthe beginning of the arc to decrease the synchrotron\nradiation to the IP. Since the longitudinal space in the IR\nis very tight, it is difficult to adopt a compensation\nscheme using skew quadrupoles. Thus, the coupling is\nlocally compensated inside the detector with antisolenoids and skew quadrupole coils.\nIn the RF region, there are seven quadrupoles to\nconnect the arc regions of the inner and outer rings. Part\nof the RF region is dispersion free, and the \u03b2 functions at\nthe RF cavities in both vertical and horizontal planes are\nless than 15 m.\nAt the injection points, dispersion is zero as well as the\nsymmetry position in the inner ring. The horizontal \u03b2\nfunction is larger than 20 m to reduce the sigma\namplitude of the remnant oscillation of the injected beam.\nThe phase advance between two kickers is \u03c0.\nThe main consideration of the optics in the arc region is\nto meet the designed emittance, momentum compaction\nfactor, tunes and a sufficient dynamic aperture. The \u03b2\nfunctions in both vertical and horizontal planes are less\nthan 25 m, and the dispersion is less than 2.5 m. The\nhorizontal \u03b2 functions at focusing sextupoles and the\nvertical \u03b2 functions at defocusing sextupoles are as large\nas possible. Moreover, the limited vertical aperture at the\ninsertion devices leads to the constraint of vertical \u03b2\nfunction.\n\n2.4 Chromaticity Correction and Dynamic\nAperture\nA sufficient dynamic aperture is necessary, either for\nefficient beam injection or long beam lifetime. Though\nthe requirements for the injection and the colliding beams\nare slightly different, we use the condition of the injection\nbeam for both cases, which means a large momentum\nacceptance (~10\u03c3\u03b5) and large transverse apertures. For the\ntracking results evaluated here, the horizontal RMS beam\nsize is taken from the natural horizontal emittance at 2.1\nGeV (0.18 \u03bcm), and the vertical size \u03c3y from the fullycoupled emittance, i.e., half of the uncoupled horizontal\nemittance. In the dynamic aperture tracking with SAD [3]\nprogram, particles are launched at the IP with 1000 turns.\n\n\f36 sextupoles are used to correct natural chromaticities\nin each storage ring, powered by 18 power supplies. With\nthese sextupoles, chromaticities of the BEPCII storage\nring are corrected to 1.0.\nFig. 4 shows the tracking results for the BEPCII\ndynamic aperture. One can see that the dynamic aperture\nis significantly reduced if errors from magnets are\nincluded. Studies show that for 6.53/7.58 region the\ndynamic aperture is sensitive on K1 errors for the dipoles\nand quadrupoles and more sensitive if the horizontal tune\nis closer to the half integer, this means the linear lattice\nmust be well performed otherwise it will be difficult to\noperate the machine close to the half integer, for\n6.53/5.58 region the situation is better than 6.53/7.58\nregion.\ny\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nx\n\nFigure 4: Dynamic aperture for BEPCII.

The design goal of the SR\nmode is to operate electron beam at 2.5 GeV with a\nmaximum beam current of 250 mA. The betatron tunes\nare chosen as \u03bdx/\u03bdy = 8.28/5.18. The emittance is thus 120\nnm\u22c5rad at 2.5 GeV. If the dispersion at RF cavities is\nallowable, the emittance can reach 100 nm\u22c5rad or less.\nThe maximum beta functions \u03b2x and \u03b2y are smaller than\n23 m. The maximum horizontal dispersion function Dx is\nabout 1.65 m. The natural chromaticity is \u03bex0 = \u221211.6 and\n\u03bey0 = \u22129.7 for the horizontal and vertical planes,\n\nrespectively. The dynamic aperture is larger than 25\u03c3\neven with 0.8% energy spread.\n\n2.6 Beam Injection\nBEPCII will keep the BEPC's horizontal phase space\nmulti-turn injection, and maintain its beam transport lines,\nwhich connect the linac and the ring. In order to achieve a\nhigh average luminosity, the beam injection rates have to\nbe greatly improved, which are expected to be higher than\n200 mA/min and 50 mA/min for e\u2212 and e+ beams,\nrespectively. To ensure this high injection rates, for the\npositron beam, two-bunch injection scheme will be\nadopted with an adjustable injection repetition (12.5 Hz,\n25 Hz, and 50 Hz).\nThe BEPC beam transport lines are upgraded in many\naspects, such as replacing the old power supplies, adding\nfour new independent power supplies to free some lattice\nmatching constraints and installing new beam position\nmonitors along the lines to keep close and real time\ncontrol of the beam central orbits. In order to reduce the\nnumber of the particles lost in the ring, especially in the\ninteraction region, collimators are needed in the beam\ntransport lines to clean the particles with large betatron\namplitude or energy deviation. Instead of the BEPC's\ninjection through windows separating the transport line\nand the storage ring, the beam pipes of transport line will\nbe directly connected to the storage ring to minimize the\nemittance dilution. So the vacuum condition in the end of\nthe transport lines should be improved.\nTwo horizontal kickers with a phase advance of \u03c0 are\nemployed to create the horizontal closed orbit bump for\nthe circular beam. The Lamberston septa of BEPC are\nstill kept. Since the bunch spacing is changed, new kicker\nmagnet power supplies and vacuum chamber are being\nstudied. The physical apertures given by the IR are\n14\u03c3x,y,0 +2 mm (COD), which impose strict constraint to\nthe beam injection path. The half aperture of collimators\nin the ring is designated to ~12.5\u03c3x,y,0 . Simulations of the\ninjection bunch's motion with collimators are carried out\nto decide the injection efficiency. Top-off injection will\nbe adopted to achieve the higher average luminosity.\n\n3 COLLECTIVE EFFECT\nIn BEPCII, to achieve the high luminosity, the micro-\u03b2\nscheme is adopted. This requires that the bunch length be\nwell controlled to 1.5cm. However, bunch lengthens due\nto the potential well distortion and microwave instability.\nNormally, we chose the design bunch under the threshold\nof microwave instability. This corresponds to an\nimpedance threshold of 0.97 \u03a9 at the design current of\n9.8mA. Calculation and beam measurement have shows\nthat the broadband impedance of the present BEPC\nstorage ring is about 4 \u03a9, thus a strict impedance budget\nhas been made with efforts on designing and optimizing\nthe main vacuum components to reduce the impedance.\nThe main impedance generating elements and their\nimpedance are listed in Table 2. The budget of (Z/n)0 is\nestimated as 0.23 \u03a9.\n\n\fTable 2: Impedance and loss factor of each component\nComponent\nNo.\nL\nkl\nHOM\n(nH)\n(V/pC)\n(kW)\nSRF\n1\n0.67\n4.74\nResist.

At 9.8 mA, the bunch lengthens by about 5%.\nThe coupled bunch instabilities can arise from the highQ resonant structures, such as the RF cavities and the\nresistive-wall impedance of the beam pipe. In BEPCII,\nsuperconducting cavities (SC) are adopted, so HOMs can\nbe well damped. The up bound of the growth rates is\nfirstly estimated by assuming symmetric filling pattern\nwith 99 equally spaced bunches and each bunch has\ncurrents of 9.8 mA. This is confirmed by the multiparticle tracking results. The growth time of the fastest\ngrowing instability modes is at the same level of the\nsynchrotron radiation damping time, so longitudinal\nfeedback system will be considered. The growth rate of\nthe most dangerous mode due to resistive-wall is of 4.3\nms, so this should be damped with bunch-to-bunch\ntransverse feedback system.\nTo avoid ion trapping, a clearing gap with 5% of the\ntotal buckets absent is required, i.e. with one bunch train\nof 93 bunches. The Fast Beam-Ion Instability (FBII) has\nbeen studied with analytical formulae as well as tracking\ncode, the growth time of FBII is about 3 ms which should\nbe damped with the feedback system.\nIn analogy to other two ring colliders such as , KEKB\nand PEPII, the electron cloud instability (ECI) may lead\nto the beam-size blow-up and luminosity degradation in\nBEPCII. With the existing formula [4], the threshold\nelectron cloud density leading to transverse mode-coupled\ninstability is higher than that of two B-factories. This may\nattribute to the smaller circumference of BEPCII. To\nguarantee the beam performance against ECI,\nantechamber with the inner surface of beam chamber TiN\ncoated is used in the arc to reduce the primary and\nsecondary electron yields, and in the straight section\nspace may be reserved to wind solenoids to suppress the\nconcentration of electrons near the beam axis. Besides,\n\nwe are also investigating the possibility to install clearing\nelectrodes to sweep out electrons. A simulation code[5]\nhas been developed to estimate the electron cloud density\ntaking into account each effect due to the antechamber\nstructure, the TiN coating and clearing electrode,\nrespectively. A typical distribution of electron cloud\ndensity in the antechamber is shown in Fig.5.\n\nFigure 5: The electron cloud density in the antechamber.\nSimulation shows that with antechamber and TiN coating,\nthe EC density is substantially lower than the instability\nthreshold, and feedback system is still needed to\novercome the coupled bunch instabilities.\nIn BEPCII, the beam lifetime is mainly determined by\nbeam-beam bremsstrahlung during beam collision, which\nis calculated as 5.1 hours at the peak luminosity. Other\nlimits are from the beam-gas scattering which gives beam\nlifetime of about 26 hrs at the vacuum pressure of 8\u00d710-9\nTorr, and the Touschek effect of about 7.1 hrs. So the\ntotal beam lifetime is around 3.0 hrs. With the top-off\ninjection the maximum average luminosity is expected as\n60% of the peak luminosity\n\n4 SUMMARY\nThe main issues in BEPCII accelerator physics design\nare described. The beam-beam simulation shows the\ncrossing angle of 2\u00d711mrad is acceptable and the beambeam parameter of 0.04 is reasonable and reachable. The\ngeometry satisfies the requirements for both colliding and\nsynchrotron radiation mode. The IR design realizes the\nrapid separation of two beams and can meet all the\nrequirements from hardwares. The optics for the collision\nmode is very flexible on emittance and tunes, with a good\ndynamic aperture even for 10\u03c3\u03b5, off-momentum particles\nand with multipoles' error as well as the misaliagnment\neffects. The injection design satisfies the requirements for\nthe top-off injection scheme. For collective effects, a\nstrict impedance budget is made and there is no show\nstoppers. However, feedback systems are required.\n\n5 REFERENCES\n[1] K. Hirata, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74(1995)\n[2] K.
