Many\nof them belong to the class of perovskites (cubic crystals whose chemical formula is ABO3 )\nwhich are thought to have a good ability to grow as crystalline films. However, the interface\nwith Si is of crucial importance as it must avoid gap states and be structurally compatible\nwith the film's crystallographic structure. In the search of the best candidate, the LaAlO3\ncrystal raised out of the perovskite family. This was partly due to its lower mismatch with the\nSi(001) surface (0.7 %). Moreover, the conduction band offset is expected to be greater than\n1 eV. A value has been computed[1] to be 1 eV within the \"charge neutrality level model\"\nwhich does not take the interface structure into account. Nevertheless, as La, Al and O\nrespective oxidation states are +III, +III and -II, the AlO2 and LaO layers are respectively\ncharged with -1 and +1 electron which makes it a polar crystal. This polar aspect leads to\na more complex interface construction than dealing with non polar perovskites.\nThis letter focuses on the interface between a polar perovskite and Si(100)-p(2\u00d71), taking\nLaAlO3 as a prototype. The interface may start with the deposition of La or Al atoms. For\nan interface starting with La, Ashman et al. [2] have shown that La atoms cover the Si\nsurface by pairs. This scheme is coherent with the \"electron counting model\" where 2 La\natoms provide 6 electrons to 6 Si dangling bonds, removing gap states and assuming a\ncoverage of 2/3 monolayer (ML). Klenov et al. [3] have grown a Si thin film on a LaAlO3\nsubstrate and microscopy has shown that the interface was based on La pairs. This interface\nhas been theoretically studied by F\u00f6rst et al. [4] to define the interface's Si and O networks\nthat can not be resolved by the microscopy. The Si network obtained by Si epitaxy is not\nclearly coherent with LaAlO3 epitaxy on the (2\u00d71) reconstructed Si surface. In order to\navoid dipole moment of the polar surfaces of LaAlO3 , Knizhnik et al. [5] have constructed\ntheoretical interfaces by transfering O from one boundary surface to the other in their\nLaAlO3 slab.\nOur aim here is to build an interface starting with Al atom deposition, compatible with\nthe growth of LaO-AlO2 neutral bilayers, without midgap states.\nDue to the odd oxidation state of Al (+III), atoms are arranged by pairs on the Si surface.\nIndeed, it is well known for indium, aluminum and so on that the most stable geometry\n(Fig.1) is realized at a coverage of 1/2 ML by pairs of adatoms forming monoatomic chains\n[6]. As the coverage of Si by Al lines has been realized ten years ago, we take this surface\n2\n\n\fas a starting point for the growth of LaAlO3 .\nThe electronic structures were computed thanks to the SIESTA code [7]. We made use\nof the same pseudopotentials and basis sets as Knizhnik et al. [5]. The atomic basis for\nLa, Al and O atoms were single-zeta plus polarization, and Si basis were double-zeta plus\npolarization. The supercells were fully relaxed in the Harris functional framework (until a\nmaximun force tolerance of 0.1 eV/\u00c5 is reached). Then the electronic structure of the relaxed\nsupercell was calculated in the Self-Consistent-Field framework, using a 2\u00d72\u00d71 k-point grid.\nWe carried out electronic structure calculations of this Al-lines template to get insights\non the electron distribution and bonds at the surface. We considered a supercell made of\na 7 Si layer slab whose bottom layer was fixed and saturated by hydrogen atoms, and top\nsurface was covered by the adatoms and a vacuum slab of 14 \u00c5. Charge density maps\n(Fig.2) show high density regions between top Si atoms and Al atoms, representing the\ninterface's Si-Al bonds. We also notice another high density region inside each pair of Al\natoms, corresponding to Al-Al bonds. Thus, one may understand that a pair of Al provides\n4 electrons to 4 Si dangling bonds while the 2 Al share 2 electrons, leading to a coverage of\n1/2 ML. Electronic densities of states (Fig.3) shows that the half filled state in the band gap\nof the Si(001)-p(2\u00d71) disappeared in favor of the Si-Al bond creation. Therefore, electron\ncounting model must be \"extended\" to take into account the dimer formed by the adatoms.\nThis Si surface covered by half a layer of Al was then oxidized thanks to two approaches:\ni) by considering electron counting arguments to obtain a neutral interface, ii) by computing\nwith an ab initio method the energy of the system with one O atom at various positions\n(A-F on Fig.1) in order to define the most stable ones. Let us first count the electrons. In\norder to construct a neutral interface, one considers that N O atoms need 2N electrons.\nAs the (1\u00d71) surface unit cell provides 2.5 electrons (1 electron from the dangling bonds\nand 1.5 electrons from the Al0.5 ML), the interface is neutral with 1.25 O atoms. Thus, the\ninterface stoichiometry should be Al0.5 O1.25 . Now, within ab initio computations, each of\nthe A-F site's vertical position was relaxed and the final total energy values were compared.\nA and C sites have similar energies and are more stable than the others by more than 1 eV\nper supercell. This may be easily understood if one considers the trend of O atoms to go\nwhere a high electron density stands (on Si-Al and Al-Al bonds). These stable sites were\nthen fully filled and lead to the addition of 1.25 O ML which is in agreement with a neutral\ninterface. Let us here mention that the addition of one O atom on each Si-Si bridge (B sites)\n3\n\n\fleads to 1.75 O ML which also leads to a neutral interface.\nThe resulting Al0.5 O1.25 surface was fully relaxed and its electronic structure studied. SiO bond length is found to be similar to those in SiO2 . Al-O distances (from 1.76 to 1.85 \u00c5)\nare compatible with those in an AlO2 plane of LaAlO3 . Atoms in the Al0.5 O1.25 layer are\nnearly in the same plane. Concerning the electronic density of states (Fig.3), the oxidation\ndoes not add states in the gap of the Al covered surface, and the Si gap is finally recovered.\nThe same behaviour occurs for Al0.5 O1.75 .\nIn order to define further growth over the Al0.5 O1.25 layer, the interface was also capped\nby a neutral LaAlO3 bilayer and both LaO-AlO2 and AlO2 -LaO sequences with various in\nplane positions were constructed and relaxed (Fig.4). Their total energies were found to\nbe equivalent, showing that further growth on the interface would be similar whatever its\nstructure would be. Moreover, the perovskite structure of the relaxed bilayer was maintained,\ndemonstrating the possibility of growing LaAlO3 over this interface.\nThe stability of this interface against oxidation was tested using the method proposed\nby F\u00f6rst et al.[8]. Figure 5 shows the adsorption energy of O atoms per (1\u00d71) surface\nunit cell for various O coverages. When possible, several structures were constructed for a\nfixed coverage, whose lowest energy corresponds to the most stable one. On this basis, our\nAl0.5 O1.25 interfacial layer is more stable than other lower coverages and coverages higher\nthan 1.75 (which corresponds to Al0.5 O1.25 with Si-Si oxidized dimers). Using this figure,\nthe oxygen chemical potential was evaluated to construct the phase diagram for interface\noxidation (Fig.6). It shows that: i) for a chemical potential below -0.35 eV, the Al0.5 O1.25\ninterfacial layer can be formed without silica, ii) for a chemical potential between -0.35 eV\nand 0 eV, the Si-Si dimers below the Al0.5 O1.25 interfacial layer are oxidized, leading to the\nAl0.5 O1.75 stoichiometry.\nConcerning applications, a key point is the conduction band offset with Si, which is\nwhished to be greater than 1 eV to avoid tunnelling through the oxide barrier. As the\ninterface between the oxide and Si greatly influences its value, it is important to evaluate\nthe offset for each interface. We computed this offset for the Al0.5 O1.25 interface followed\nby the previous sequences. The computations were realized on supercells built as follow: H\n- Si slice (13 \u00c5) - LaAlO3 (19 \u00c5) - Si slice (13 \u00c5) - H containing a mirror plane in order\nto avoid infinite addition of the interface's electronic dipole. The average potential method\nwas used to evaluate the band offsets [9]. The computed conduction band offsets is 1.9 eV\n4\n\n\fwhich is large enough for microelectronics applications. In case of Al0.5 O1.75 , the offset does\nnot change by more than 0.1 eV.\nIn conclusion, we have derived an interface between a polar high-\u03ba perovskite and Si. The\ninterface corresponds to the prior growth of metal lines followed by oxidation. We emphasize\nthat the Al0.5 O1.25 interface (with or without oxidized Si-Si dimers) leads to consider LaAlO3\nas a promising material to replace SiO2 with a conduction band offset of about 1.9 eV. More\ngenerally, this result plays in favor of interfaces based on B metal atoms in case of growth\nof the polar ABO3 perovskite on the Si(001)-p(2\u00d71) surface.\nThe authors thank Knizhnik et al. for giving their pseudopotentials and basis sets to use\nin SIESTA.\n\n5\n\n\f[1] P.
