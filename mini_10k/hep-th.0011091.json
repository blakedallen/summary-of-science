The B-type D-branes turn out to be characterized by the\nproperties of a compact positively curved manifold. We give geometric interpretations to\nthese boundary states in terms of coherent sheaves of the manifold.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nD-branes are the key objects by which we can study the nature of various string theories.\nThe Cardy's boundary CFT method [1] is a very powerful tool to investigate the D-branes\nin curved spaces.\nRecently, there has been great progress [2, 3] in the study of properties of charges,\nboundary states [1, 4] based on Gepner models [5, 6]. For a large class of Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds, associated boundary states have been constructed and susy cycles have been\ninvestigated based on these states in CFTs [7\u201311], [2, 3, 12\u201318]. These references consider\nD-branes as the \"rational boundary states\" , that is, the Cardy states realized as some\nlinear combinations of tensor products of Ishibashi states of each minimal model. There\nappear many consistency checks about their charges, the intersection form of the homology\ncycles. However these analyses are restricted to compact Calabi-Yau cases.\nIn [19], Giveon et al. proposed that a string theory on a noncompact singular CalabiYau manifold X represented by a hypersurface F (z1 , . . . , zn+1 ) = 0 in Cn+1 can be described by a CFT as R\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 LG(W = F ). Here R\u03c6 is a linear dilaton and LG(W = F )\nis the two dimensional N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg theory with the superpotential F .\n\nAlso, in [20\u201324], the modular invariant partition functions can be constructed in the\n\ncases that LG(W = F )'s are minimal models or direct products of minimal models, and\nit is shown that associated string theories on these singular spaces can exist consistently.\nThey are extensions of Gepner models from compact manifolds to noncompact varieties\nwith singularities.\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a method to construct boundary states of noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and to investigate their properties in order to\nunderstand structures of moduli spaces in the open string channel. In this paper, we explore the \"rational\" D-branes on a noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifold by applying\nthe Cardy's method to the Gepner-like description of the noncompact singular Calabi-Yau\nmanifold.\nAs a result, the open string Witten index turns out to be factorized into \u03b81 (\u03c4 )(= 0)\nfactor and a nontrivial one, in the same way as the closed string Witten index [22] does.\nWe investigate the nontrivial factor in the open string Witten index and show that they\ncoincide with some pairings of bundles in the manifold X/C\u00d7 .\nTo confirm the validity of this claim, we calculate the relative Euler characteristics of\nthe bundles in X/C\u00d7 by applying geometrical methods to a special case, where X/C\u00d7 is\nwritten as a Fermat type hypersurface z1N + * * * + zrN = 0 in CP r\u22121. We compare it with\nthe result in the CFT calculations.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review the Gepner-like description\nof noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and fix our convention. In section 3, we\n2\n\n\fconstruct the boundary states of the noncompact manifold in the Gepner-like description\nand study intersection number between these states. This intersection pairing is understood as a combination of characteristic classes with a pair of boundary bundles and we\ncompare the result in the CFT with the geometrical ones. We give geometrical interpretations to the boundary states in terms of coherent sheaves in section 4. Charges of\nD-branes wrapped on the susy cycles are realized as characteristic classes of the sheaves.\nSection 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions. In appendix A, we summarize several useful properties of theta functions. Periods near the orbifold point are collected in\nappendix B. Also formulas of periods in the large volume region are shown concretely in\nappendix C.\n\n2\n\nThe closed string theory on a noncompact singular\nCalabi-Yau manifold\n\nIn this section, we summarize the Gepner-like description of the closed string theory on\na noncompact singular Calabi-Yau n-fold X. We mainly use the same conventions as in\nthe paper [22].\nWe assume that the X is realized as a zero locus F (z1 , . . . , zn+1 ) = 0 in Cn+1 , where\nF (z) is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial, i.e. it satisfies the relation\nF (\u03bbr1 z1 , . . . , \u03bbrn+1 zn+1 ) = \u03bbF (z1 , . . . , zn+1 )\n\nfor \u2203 rj \u2208 R, \u2200 \u03bb \u2208 C\u00d7 .\n\nIt is proposed in [19] that the string theory on X is described by a model\nR\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 LG(W = F ),\nwhere R\u03c6 is a real line with a linear dilaton background and LG(W = F ) is a scale invariant theory realized in the IR limit of the Landau-Ginzburg theory with the superpotential\nF . In this paper we consider the case where LG(W = F ) is described as a direct product\nof A-type minimal models, namely, the polynomial F is written as a linear combination\nof constituent minimal models\n2\n2\n.\n+ * * * + zn+1\nF (z1 , . . . , zn+1 ) = z1N1 + * * * + zrNr + zr+1\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere the Landau-Ginzburg theory is composed of r minimal models and the level of the\nj-th minimal model is Nj \u2212 2.\n\nThe remaining parts R\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 also have worldsheet N = 2 superconformal symme-\n\ntry. We denote the bosonic coordinates of R\u03c6 and S 1 by \u03c6 and Y , respectively, and\nthe fermionic counterparts of R\u03c6 and S 1 by the free fermions \u03c8 \u00b1 . Then the N = 2\n3\n\n\fsuperconformal currents are expressed as\n1\nQ\n1\n1\nT = \u2212 (\u2202Y )2 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u2202 2 \u03c6 \u2212 (\u03c8 + \u2202\u03c8 \u2212 \u2212 \u2202\u03c8 + \u03c8 \u2212 ),\n2\n2\n2\n2\nQ\n1\nG\u00b1 = \u2212 \u221a \u03c8 \u00b1 (i\u2202Y \u00b1 \u2202\u03c6) \u2213 \u221a \u2202\u03c8 \u00b1 ,\n2\n2\n+ \u2212\nJ = \u03c8 \u03c8 \u2212 Qi\u2202Y.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe Liouville field \u03c6 has a background charge Q and the associated central charge of this\nalgebra is given as \u0109 (:= c/3) = 1 + Q2 . Since we are considering the string theory on\na Calabi-Yau n-fold, the central charge should satisfy the consistency condition \u0109 = n.\nWhen we take into account of the background charge Q of R\u03c6 , the condition on the central\ncharge is represented as\nr\nX\nNj \u2212 2\n1+Q +\n= n.\nNj\nj=1\n2\n\nIt means that the background charge Q is determined from the parameters of the minimal\nmodels r, Nj through a relation\nr\nX\n2\n.\nQ =n\u22121\u2212r+\nN\nj\nj=1\n2\n\nFor simplicity, we concentrate on the case that n \u2212 1 \u2212 r \u2261 0 mod 2 in this paper. Then\n\nKQ2 is an even integer with K = lcm(Nj ) and we can define an integer J as\nJ :=\n\nKQ2\n\u2208 Z.\n2\n\nNext, let us construct the modular invariant partition function of this model and\ndetermine the spectrum. As a consistency condition, we have to pick up only the states\nwith integral U(1) charges since we want a Calabi-Yau CFT. First the linear dilaton \u03c6\ndoes not have any U(1) charge and we can independently consider the partition function\nZL of \u03c6 [20]\nZL (\u03c4, \u03c4\u0304 ) = \u221a\n\n1\n,\n\u03c42 |\u03b7(\u03c4 )|2\n\nwhere \u03b7(\u03c4 ) is the Dedekind eta function.\nThe other parts, Y, \u03c8 \u00b1 and fields in the minimal models carry U(1) charges, and we\nmust apply the GSO projection to them. Let us consider first the case of Y . If we consider\nthe Verma module with primary field eipY for a real number p, the character of this Verma\nmodule is q p\n\n2 /2\n\n/\u03b7(\u03c4 ), where q = exp(2\u03c0i\u03c4 ). One can see the U(1) charge of the states in\n\nthis Verma module is pQ. We should take the case that KpQ is an integer, since the U(1)\ncharge of the other part is (integer)/K and the total U(1) charge should be an integer.\n4\n\n\fIf we write KpQ = 2KJu + m0 with two integers u, m0 and sum up the character for all\nu \u2208 Z, then we obtain the relation\nX q 21 p2\n\u0398m0 ,KJ (\u03c4 )\n=\n.\n\u03b7(\u03c4\n)\n\u03b7(\u03c4\n)\nu\u2208Z\nNote that the U(1) charges of the states included in these Verma module are m0 /K\nmod 2J.\nNext we shall consider fermionic parts. The Verma modules of two fermions \u03c8 \u00b1 are\ncharacterized by an integer s0 = 0, 1, 2, 3. The states with s0 = 0, 2 belong to the NS\nsector, and ones with s0 = 1, 3 are states in the R sector. The characters of these Verma\nmodules are expressed by using theta functions \u0398s0 ,2 (\u03c4 )/\u03b7(\u03c4 ).\nLast we study the Verma modules of a minimal model. An arbitrary Verma module in\nthis model is labelled by three integers (l, m, s). They take their values in the following\nranges\nl = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 2,\nm = 0, 1, . . . , 2N \u2212 1,\ns = 0, 1, 2, 3,\nl+m+s\u22610\n\nmod 2.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe states with s0 = 0, 2 belong to the NS sector, and ones with s0 = 1, 3 are states in\nthe R-sector. From now on, we denote the character of this Verma module as \u03c7l,s\nm (\u03c4 )\nIn order to consider the whole Verma module of a set of minimal models, we introduce\nthe following vector notations\n~l = (l1 , . . . , lr ),\n\nm\n~ = (m0 , m1 , . . . , mr ),\n\n~s = (s0 , s1 , . . . , sr ),\n\na = (~l, m,\n~ ~s)\n\nwhere (lj , mj , sj ), j = 1, . . . , r is a set of indices of the Verma module in the j-th minimal\nmodel and m0 and s0 were defined above.

The\npicture in this section is based on the closed strings on the singular manifolds. However\nD-branes couple with strings only through open strings and it is important to develop a\nmethod to describe open strings in these models. The open strings can end on susy cycles\nof the target manifolds and encode information on homology cycles of the manifolds. In\nthe context of CFT, we are able to analyze properties of these boundaries of the open\nstrings based on the boundary states. In the next section, we will construct boundary\nstates associated with these singular manifolds and investigate their properties.\n\n3\n\nBoundary states and the intersection form\n\n3.1\n\nThe open string in the N = 2 Liouville theory\n\nHere we consider D-branes in our model and analyze the properties of the associated open\nstrings. Generally it is known that two types (A-type and B-type) of boundary conditions\nare possible for N = 2 superconformal currents. These boundary conditions in the open\n\nstring channel are defined on the worldsheet boundary z = z\u0304;\n\u2022 A-type boundary condition\n\nT = T\u0304 , G\u00b1 = \u03b5\u1e20\u2213 , J = \u2212J \u0304.\n\u2022 B-type boundary condition\n \u0304\nT = T\u0304 , G\u00b1 = \u03b5\u1e20\u00b1 , J = +J.\nHere, \u03b5 = 1 in R-sector with z > 0 and NS-sector, \u03b5 = \u22121 in R-sector with z < 0 . First\nwe consider the boundary conditions in the N = 2 Liouville sector. Using N = 2 super-\n\nconformal currents represented by free fields (2.2), we express the boundary conditions\nfor free fields \u03c6, Y and \u03c8 \u00b1 ;\n\u2022 A-type\n \u0304 (Neumann) , \u2202Y = \u2212\u2202Y\n \u0304 (Dirichlet) , \u03c8 \u00b1 = \u03b5\u03c8\u0304 \u2213 .\n\u2202\u03c6 = \u2202\u03c6\n\u2022 B-type\n \u0304 (Neumann) , \u2202Y = +\u2202Y\n \u0304 (Neumann) , \u03c8 \u00b1 = \u03b5\u03c8\u0304 \u00b1 .\n\u2202\u03c6 = \u2202\u03c6\n7\n\n\fWe make a remark here; We don't consider a Dirichlet boundary condition for the linear\ndilaton field \u03c6 because it has a subtle problem. For an example, if we naively take a\n \u0304 then, from the form of the current (2.2), we can\nboundary condition of \u03c6 as \u2202\u03c6 = \u2212\u2202\u03c6,\n\nshow that the boundary condition on the stress tensor does not satisfy T = T\u0304 . So, we\n \u0304 is not a good boundary condition.\nconclude that \u2202\u03c6 = \u2212\u2202\u03c6\n\nIn the previous section, we consider closed strings on the Calabi-Yau manifold. In\n\nthat case, modular transformations play essential roles in constructing consistent string\ntheories. In the open string case, important information on modular transformations are\nencoded in the annulus amplitudes. So we will consider the annulus amplitudes and study\nmodular properties of them.\nIt is well-known that the annulus amplitude is calculated either as an open string\n1-loop partition function or as a closed string transition amplitude from one boundary\nstate to the other. We denote the moduli parameter of the annulus by \u03c42 . It is the radius\nof the circular direction of the annulus when we normalize the length of the perimeter to\n\u03c0. We also use the following notations in the open string channel\n\u03c4 = i\u03c42 , q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 .\nOn the other hand, we use the following notations in the closed string channel\n\u03c4\u0303 = i\u03c4\u03032 = \u22121/\u03c4, q\u0303 = e2\u03c0i\u03c4\u0303 ,\nbecause it is more useful to set the radius of the circle to be 1 in the closed string case.\nThen the length of the segment becomes \u03c0\u03c4\u03032 = \u03c0/\u03c42 .\nNow we introduce a boundary state |BL ii for the linear dilaton. It is determined\n\nuniquely because the boundary condition on the linear dilaton is always Neumann type\nand has no free parameters. We can easily calculate the annulus amplitude by open string\nchannel\nO\n\nTr q L0 \u2212(1+3Q\nO\n\n2 )/24\n\n=\u221a\n\n1\nC\nC\n2\n= hhBL |q\u0303 L0 +L\u03040 \u2212(1+3Q )/12 |BL ii .\n\u03c42 \u03b7(\u03c4 )\n\n(3.1)\n\nBecause the linear dilaton sector has no contribution to the U(1) charge, and because\nwe treat it as a free field, it decouples from the other sector 1 , as follows. If we denote\nthe boundary states of the other sectors than linear dilaton, i.e. the free fermions, the S 1\nboson, and the minimal models, |\u03b1ii, we can write the total boundary state as |BL ii\u2297|\u03b1ii.\n1\n\nVery recently, a paper [25] appeared where a boundary state and related amplitudes in the Liouville\nsector are discussed based on the perturbative expansions of screened vertex operators and their analytic\ncontinuations.\n\n8\n\n\fThe annulus amplitude can be written as\n(total) C\n\n(hhBL | \u2297 hh\u03b1\u0303|)q\u0303 L0\n\n(total) C\n\n+L\u03040\n\n\u2212c/12\n\n(|BL ii \u2297 |\u03b1ii)\n\n(linear dilaton) C\n(linear dilaton) C\nL0\n+L\u03040\n\u2212(1+3Q2 )/12\n\n(other) C\n\n= hhBL |q\u0303\n|BL ii hh\u03b1|q\u0303 L0\n(other) C\n(other) C\n1\n+L\u03040\n\u2212cother /12\nhh\u03b1|q\u0303 L0\n|\u03b1ii.\n=\u221a\n\u03c42 \u03b7(\u03c4 )\n\n(other) C\n\n+L\u03040\n\n\u2212cother /12\n\n|\u03b1ii\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we neglect the linear dilaton factor, but we can always obtain\nthe full amplitude by multiplying the linear dilaton factor\n\n\u221a 1\n\u03c42 \u03b7(\u03c4 )\n\n.\n\nAs a second case, we look at the S 1 sector. The boundary states in the bosonic S 1\nsector are expressed by ordinary coherent states. For the A-type (Dirichlet) boundary\ncondition, the associated state is expressed as\n\"\u221e\n#\nX1\n|piiA := exp\nYn \u0232n |p, p\u0304 = pi,\nn\nn=1\n\nwhere |p, p\u0304i is the closed string Fock vacuum with zero mode eigenvalues p and p\u0304. For the\n\nB-type (Neumann) boundary condition, we can obtain the boundary state by changing\nsigns of \u0232n , p\u0304 for the A-type case\n#\n\u221e\nX\n1\nYn \u0232n |p, p\u0304 = \u2212pi.\n|piiB := exp \u2212\nn\nn=1\n\"\n\nIn the following discussions, we sometimes omit the subscripts A, B when the methods of\ncalculations are applicable in both types of states.\nWith these boundary states, the transition amplitude is evaluated for the S 1 sector\nby using the Dedekind eta function\n1 2\n\n\u2032\n\nhhp |q\u0303\n\nHC\n\nq\u0303 2 p\n|pii = \u03b4p,p\u2032\n.\n\u03b7(\u03c4\u0303 )\n\nBut this amplitude does not have good properties under modular transformations. In\norder to improve this defect, we take a linear combination of |pii's in the same manner\nas that in the closed string \"Verma module\" case and define a state |m0 ii\nX\n2KJu + m0\n|m0 ii =\n|p =\nii.\nKQ\nu\u2208Z\n\nIn this case, an associated transition amplitude between |m0 ii and |m0 ii\u2032 are expressed\nas a combination of a theta function and the eta function\nC\nmod 2KJ \u0398m0 ,KJ (\u03c4\u0303 )\nhhm\u20320 |q\u0303 H |m0 ii := \u03b4m\n.\n\u2032\n0 \u2212m0\n\u03b7(\u03c4\u0303 )\n\nIt has nice properties under modular transformations and we take this as a candidate of\nconstituent block of a total boundary state. In the next subsection, we collect results\nabout boundary states of various constituent fields discussed in this section and analyze\na total boundary state of the whole theory.\n9\n\n\f3.2\n\nTotal boundary states and the intersection form\n\nIn this subsection we consider the whole theory realized as a product of various models\nR\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 MN1 \u00d7 MN2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 MNr\nand construct associated boundary states.\nIn order to complete this program, we still have to make boundary states associated\nwith minimal models. It seems difficult to construct full boundary states associated with\nthe tensor product of minimal models. In this paper, we shall concentrate on \"rational\nboundary states\". They are constructed as (linear combinations of) tensor products of\nboundary states of sub-theories and are expressed as (omitting the R\u03c6 part)\n|aii := |s0 ii \u2297 |m0 ii \u2297 |l1 , m1 , s1 ii \u2297 * * * \u2297 |lr , mr , sr ii.\nHere the index a is the same symbol as that used in the section 2, and |lj , mj , sj ii's are\n\nordinary Ishibashi states of minimal models [8].\n\nThe choices of boundary types lead to make differences in allowed states. For the\nA-type boundary state, the U(1) charges of the left and right movers are the same and\nall the A-type boundary states with the condition (2.4) are available. On the other hand,\nfor the B-type boundary condition, the U(1) charges of the left and right movers have the\nsame absolute values but opposite signs and the allowed states must satisfy a condition\n1 ~\nm\n~ = b\u03b2,\n2\n\nb \u2208 Z.\n\nUsing above Ishibashi states, we can construct the Cardy states with appropriate coefficients determined by the S matrix under the S modular transformation. In the next two\nsubsections, we construct the Cardy states concretely for A-type and B-type cases.\n3.2.1\n\nA-type boundary states\n\nA Cardy state [1] with the A-type boundary condition is labelled by a set of indices\n~ M\n~ , S).\n~ Here the L,\n~ M,\n~ S\n~ are respectively the same type vectors as ~l, m,\n\u03b1 = (L,\n~ ~s.

In the next subsection, we take a simple class of manifolds as an example\nand calculate its open string Witten index. That is compared with a geometric result in\nthe next section and confirms the validity of our results about boundary states.\n\n3.3\n\nA simple class of manifolds\n\nIn the previous subsection, we showed that the open string Witten index vanishes. But\nit is factorized into\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b81 (\u03c4 )\n\u03c42 \u03b7(\u03c4 )3\n\n(= 0) and a rather nontrivial factor. In this subsection, we\n\ntake a simple class of manifolds for an example and consider the meaning of the nontrivial\nfactor.\nFor simplicity, we concentrate on the B-type boundary states. The singular manifold\nX is realized as a fibered space over X/C\u00d7 [22]\nX = X/C\u00d7 \u00d7f C\u00d7 ,\nwhere the symbol \"\u00d7f \" means a fibration. In the Gepner-like description, X/C\u00d7 seems\nto correspond to a direct product of the minimal models and C\u00d7 seems to be related\nwith the N = 2 Liouville part. For the B-type D-branes, the boundary conditions on\n\ntwo bosons \u03c6, Y in the N = 2 Liouville part are Neumann types. In other words, all the\n\nB-type D-branes spread to the C\u00d7 direction. The C\u00d7 part has a trivial structure and the\n\nB-type D-brane is essentially characterized by cycles of X/C\u00d7 as we show in Fig. 1.\nLet us consider a simple case that X is written as\nN\nz1N + z2N + * * * + zn+1\n= 0 in Cn+1 .\n\n13\n\n\f\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\no\nFigure 1: The image of the intersecting noncompact two cycles. The whole space expresses\nthe singular Calabi-Yau manifold X and the origin O is the singularity. The radial\ndirection expresses the \u03c6 and Y direction, along which all the B-type D-branes spread.\nThe cones \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0303 express the D-branes. Since they intersect at a surface C\u00d7 of \u03c6 and\nY , the intersection number is indefinite. This is the reason why we got the intersection\nnumber 0. If we restrict to the section of the cycles (the base of the cone), the intersection\nnumber of this section in the manifold X/C\u00d7 is possibly definite. We claim that the\nnontrivial factor of the open string Witten index corresponds to this intersection pairing\nin X/C\u00d7\nWhen one notes the fact CP n \u223c\n= (Cn+1 \u2212 {0})/C\u00d7 , the X/C\u00d7 in our case turns out to be\na Ricci positive (n \u2212 1)-fold in CP n . Moreover, we concentrate to the boundary states\nwith L = S = 0 to simplify our analyses. Also we may set \u03b6\u03b1 = 1 in Eq.(3.2) because\n\nthe Cardy condition is satisfied even for that case. In this case, the boundary states are\nlabelled only by the index M. Then we can write down a nontrivial factor of the open\nstring Witten index in the B-type case explicitly\nX\n\nm\u20321 ,...,m\u2032r =0,...,2N\n\nmod 2N P\n\u03b4M\n\u2212M\u0303 +\n\nX\n\nmod 2N P\n\u03b4M\n\u2212M\u0303 +\n\nI\u02c6M M\u0303 =\n=\n\nm\u20321 ,...,m\u2032r =0,...,2N\n\n\u2032\nj (mj +1)\n\n\u2032\nj (mj +1)\n\nr\nY\n\nm \u22121\nN0,0j\n\nj=1\n\nr \u0010\nY\nj=1\n\n!\n\n\u0011\n\u03b4m\u2032j ,1 \u2212 \u03b4m\u2032j ,2N \u22121 .\n\nBecause M and M\u0303 should be even integers, we can introduce integers a, b (a, b = 0, 1, . . . , N\u2212\n1) as a = M/2 and b = M\u0303 /2.

We discuss the (anti-)symmetric part of this pairing. We consider the (anti)symmetric part of IG as\nI\u0007 := \u2212[IGt + (\u22121)r\u22121 IG ],\nthen, I\u0007 can be written as\nI\u0007 = (g \u22121 \u2212 1)r (g r\u2212N \u2212 1).\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis is interpreted as follows.\nIn an ordinary compact Gepner model written by the Landau-Ginzburg model with a\nsuperpotential\nW = z0N0 + z1N1 + * * * + zrNr ,\nthe intersection form of B-type cycles becomes [2, 13]\nY\nIL=L\u0303=0 =\n(g \u2212K/Nj \u2212 1), K = lcm(Nj ).\nj\n\nAccording to the paper [26], if we formally apply this formula to our case with a\nnegative and fractional power part\n\u2212N/(r\u2212N )\n\nW = z0\n\n+ z1N + * * * + zrN ,\n\nthen (3.5) is obtained.\nWe compare these results with a calculation of an intersection pairing in terms of\ngeometrical methods in the next section.\n\n4\n\nGeometric interpretation\n\nIn this section, we analyze topological properties of the manifold M = X/C\u00d7 discussed\nin the previous section. The study here is based on geometrical methods and we compare\nresults of intersection pairings obtained from two different approaches. It confirms the\nvalidity of our boundary states we constructed in the CFT.\n15\n\n\f4.1\n\nIntersection pairing\n\nIn this section, we interpret the results in the Gepner model geometrically. First we take\na Ricci positive d = n \u2212 1 dimensional manifold M = X/C\u00d7\nM ; z1N + z2N + * * * + zrN = 0\n\nin CP r\u22121 ,\n\nr = d+2 = n +1.\nIts first Chern class is evaluated by using a cohomology element H \u2208 H 2 (M)\nc1 (T M) = (r \u2212 N)H .\nBecause M is realized as a zero locus of an ambient space V = CP r\u22121, we can discuss\ntopological properties of M by analyzing characteristic classes of V through a restriction\non M. Our results in the previous sections are based on the analyses of open strings\nin the Gepner model and the associated objects \"D-branes\"(susy cycles) are expected to\nplay important roles in our theory. A suitable basis for D-branes in the orbifold point\n[27\u201332] is a set of line bundles (coherent sheaves) {O(\u2212a)} (a = 0, 1, 2, * * * , r \u2212 1) over\n\nV . (Associated analyses based on the Landau-Ginzburg models are performed in papers\n[33\u201336]. Also applications to N = 2 gauge theories are proposed in papers [26, 37, 38].)\nThe cylinder amplitude is interpreted as an index of the Dirac operator with boundary\ngauge bundles (E, E \u2032 ). In other words, it is a natural inner product on these bundles\nand is expressed as a relative Euler characteristic \u03c7V (E, E \u2032 ) over V (for E = O(\u2212a),\n\nE \u2032 = O(\u2212b))\n\nhO(\u2212a), O(\u2212b)iV := \u03c7V (O(\u2212a), O(\u2212b))\nZ\n=\nch(O(\u2212a)\u2217 )ch(O(\u2212b))Td(T V )\n\u0013\n\u0012V\nr\u22121+a\u2212b\n=: Ia,b ,\n=\na\u2212b\n(0 \u2264 a \u2264 r \u2212 1 ; 0 \u2264 b \u2264 r \u2212 1) ,\n\u0013r\n\u0012\nH\n.\nTd(T V ) =\n1 \u2212 e\u2212H\nFrom now on, we use an abbreviated notation Ra for O(\u2212a) (a = 0, 1, * * * , r \u2212 1).\nNext we construct the dual basis {S a } of the {Ra } (0 \u2264 a \u2264 r \u2212 1) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nX\nr\na \u2217\n\u22121\n\u2217\na\u2212b\nch(Rb )\u2217 ,\nch(S ) :=\n(I )a,b ch(Rb ) =\n(\u22121)\na\u2212b\nb\n\nb\n\nThey satisfy orthonormal conditions with respect to the intersection pairing\nhS a , Rb iV = \u03c7V (S a , Rb ) = \u03c7V (S a\u2217 \u2297 Rb ) = \u03b4 a b .\n16\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fThe set of line bundles {O(a)} (a = 0, 1, * * * , r \u2212 1) is a strongly exceptional collection\n\nof the V = CP r\u22121 and turns out to be a foundation of an associated helix of V .

The sign in Eq.(4.4) depends\n\non the choice of sequences Eqs.(4.2),(4.3), that is to say, (+) for Eq.(4.2), (\u2212) for Eq.(4.3).\nBy using Eq.(4.4) iteratively, we can reexpress the S a \u2217 as\na \u2217\n\nch(S ) =\n\na\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\nb=0\n\na\u2212b\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nr\nch(O(b)) = ch(L0 L1 * * * La\u22121 O(a)) .\na\u2212b\n\n(4.5)\n\nNamely, each element of S a \u2217 can be constructed by acting left mutations on the Ra\u2217 = O(a).\nNext we will take an equivalence class O(\u2212[a]) for {O(\u2212a)} because M has an extra\n\ncyclic property ZN at the orbifold point\n\nO(\u2212[a + N]) = O(\u2212[a]) .\nThe [a] is defined modulo N. Equivalently we can interpret the number a as an element of\na cyclic group ZN . We shall write these elements of equivalence classes in an abbreviated\nform R[a] = O(\u2212[a]) (a = 0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1).\n\nIn the previous sections, we investigate the boundary states in the Gepner model.\n\nGenerally open strings can end on susy cycles described by homology cycles. When one\ndiscusses boundary states, homology classes play essential roles. An important class of\ntopological invariants is an intersection pairing of homology cycles. These are related\nwith cylinder amplitudes of open strings with boundary gauge bundles or sheaves. Now\nwe define a pairing hR[a] , R[b] i on these bundles on M\nXXZ\nIa,b := hR[a] , R[b] i :=\nch(Ra+N l )\u2217 ch(Rb+N m )Td(T M) ,\nTd(T M) =\n\n\u0012\n\nl\u22650 m\u22650\n\u0013r \u0012\n\nH\n1 \u2212 e\u2212H\n\nM\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212N H\nNH\n17\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fAfter performing the sum with respect to m in Eq.(4.6), we can rewrite the pairing as\nXZ\n1\n* Td(T M)\nch(Ra+N l )\u2217 ch(Rb )\nhR[a] , R[b] i =\n\u2212N H\n1\n\u2212\ne\nM\nl\u22650\nXZ\nch(Ra+N l )\u2217 ch(Rb )Td(T V ) .\n=\nl\u22650\n\nR\n\nHere we used a relation\n\nM\n\npairing\nhR[a] , R[b] i =\n=:\n\nr\u22121\nX\nc=0\n\nV\n\n(* * * ) =\n\nXZ\nl\u22650\n\nmod N\n\u03b4a,c\n\nR\n\nV\n\nNH \u00d7 (* * * ).

Precise formulae of these periods are summarized in the appendix B.\n21\n\n\fIn the previous sections, we investigate properties of this model at an orbifold point\n\u03bcP \u223c 0 based on the Gepner model. When we look at the set of periods, some set of these\n\n\u03a0\u03c1 (in the Cases I,II in the appendix B) are combined into a basis of a ZN symmetry at\nthe orbifold point w = 0\nm\n\n\u03a0m/N (e2\u03c0i w) = e2\u03c0i N \u03a0m/N (w) ,\nm\n\u03c1=\n(m = 0, 1, 2, * * * , N \u2212 1) .\nN\nThe ZN action is diagonalized on this set and this is an appropriate basis to describe\nstructures near the orbifold point in the moduli space. It corresponds to N elements of\nthe basis in the Gepner model we discussed in the section 3. Now we note that the limit\nw \u2192 0 is also realized when \u03bc0 in M tends to zero. The parameter \u03bc0 is a coefficient of\nthe singular part z0\u2212u and this operation \u03bc0 \u2192 0 turns out to reduce M to M formally.\nThat is the reason why the geometric properties of M appear at the orbifold point.\nNext we continue these \u03a0\u03c1 (\u03c1 =\n\nm\nN\n\n; m = 1, 2, * * * , N \u2212 1) analytically in a large\n\nradius region and investigate their classical parts \u03a0cl\n\u03c1 .

But the singular Calabi-Yau manifold has vanishing cohomology\nelements indicated in the paper [22]. They are interpreted to be missing objects in the\nCFT calculation as pointed in [22\u201324]. Our analyses in the section 3 are based on the\nGepner model and we do not have enough understanding of these vanishing elements.\nThe study of them might be possible in the language of local mirror symmetries. But we\ndo not touch on them and postpone investigations of these singular properties in a future\nwork.\n\n22\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we developed a method to construct the boundary states in terms of the\nGepner-like description of a noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifold. We realize the\nsingular Calabi-Yau manifold as a product of the Liouville part, S 1 part and tensor\nproducts of minimal models.\nFirst we analyzed boundary conditions that can be imposed on fields in the Liouville\nand S 1 sectors. There are consistent A-,B-type conditions but the Liouville field always\nmust take a Neumann type condition. We find that this fact is reduced to the structure\nof the manifold X. It is represented as a C\u00d7 fibration over X/C\u00d7 and the C\u00d7 part is\nextended in the noncompact direction. Also the model has a linear dilaton background\nand the Liouville field is necessarily extended in the noncompact direction. It is the\nreason why the boundary condition of the Liouville field are free (Neumann type) in this\nC\u00d7 direction and it induces a trivial structure.\nIn section 3, we construct boundary states in the A-,B-type cases and calculate the\nopen string Witten indices between the boundary states. In both cases, they have a\ntrivial factor \u03b81 (\u03c4 ). It has its origin on the trivial structure of the C\u00d7 direction. Also\nthat is related with the Neumann type condition we impose on the Liouville field. In\naddition to this trivial factor, the indices have nontrivial factors. We can express these\nfactors explicitly and analyze their geometrical properties. Especially they are related\nwith B-type D-branes wrapping around the fibered space (cycle of X/C\u00d7 ) \u00d7f C\u00d7 .\n\nIn this paper, we only treat the Neumann boundary condition for the linear dilaton,\n\nin other words, D-branes wrapped on noncompact cycles on the noncompact manifold.\nIt remains an important problem whether we are able to consider the D-branes wrapped\non compact cycles on the noncompact manifold i.e. vanishing cycles. To consider the\nvanishing cycles, we need to impose some Dirichlet-like boundary condition on the N = 2\nLiouville theory in the noncompact direction. When one naively imposes a Dirichlet\n\ncondition on the \u03c6, the boundary condition of stress tensor T is broken. It makes the\nanalysis of \u03c6 difficult and we do not touch on this problem in this paper.\nIn section 4, we compare the cycle of X/C\u00d7 and the nontrivial factor of the open string\nWitten index of the B-type boundary states. They have suitable geometrical interpretations and associated Witten indices coincide with pairings of coherent sheaves of the\nmanifold. That is to say, the boundary states constructed here are identified with the S a 's\n(or equivalence classes S [a] 's). It is analogous to the compact Calabi-Yau cases [27\u201332].\nHowever for the compact Calabi-Yau cases, ambient spaces play crucial roles in the interpretations of the states in the geometrical language. In these cases, coherent sheaves\nof the ambient spaces are related with the boundary states through restrictions on the\nhypersurfaces. In contrast, for our noncompact Calabi-Yau cases, the Ricci positive man23\n\n\fifolds M in the singular CY's essentially encode information on geometrical properties of\nthe boundary states. The noncompact direction controlled by the Liouville field \u03c6 seems\nto lead a trivial contribution to our analyses because we always take a Neumann type\ncondition on the \u03c6. When we discard this trivial contribution associated with the \u03c6, the\nremaining parts could be understood from the geometric data of the M.\nOur results based on the CFT are completely satisfactory and have appropriate geometrical interpretations. But the singular Calabi-Yau manifold has vanishing cohomology\nelements indicated in the paper [22]. They are interpreted to be missing objects in the\nCFT calculation as pointed in [22\u201324]. Our analyses in the section 3 are based on the\nGepner model and we do not have enough understanding of these vanishing elements. In\nfact, we calculated the full open string Witten index between the boundary states and\nshowed it is actually zero. The reason why the index vanishes seems to be that we treat\nthe N = 2 Liouville theory as a free field theory and set the \"cosmological constant\" \u03bc0\n\nto 0. The geometrical meaning of this is that the singularity is not deformed. In [25],\nit is proposed that if the Liouville potential term is treated appropriately, then nonzero\nintersection numbers could be obtained. But our analyses here are based on the CFT calculations at the Gepner point and it seems that we study models with the \"cosmological\nconstant\" \u03bc0 = 0. That is consistent with the result [25]. More precise studies of them\nmight be possible in the language of local mirror symmetries. But we do not touch on\nthem and postpone investigations of these singular properties in a future work.\nAfter we had submitted this article in the hep-th archive, a paper [25] by T. Eguchi\nand Y.
