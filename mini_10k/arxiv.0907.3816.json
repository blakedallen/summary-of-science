We compare the computation times and precisions of three expansions for the gravitational potential. The evaluation of the series by Selvaggi et\nal (2008 Class. Quantum Grav. 25 015013) is time-consuming to be applied to\nthe gravitational constant (G) or STEP experiments.\nPACS numbers: 04.80.\u2013y, 02.60.\u2013x\n\nWe compare the computational efficiency of three published expansions for the\ngravitational potential (GP) of a finite, hollow, thick-walled cylinder with constant\nmass density \u03c1 and reflection symmetry with respect to the plane z = 0. The\nexpansions are those developed by Lockerbie et al , Schlamminger et al and Selvaggi\net al [1, 2, 3].\nIf V denotes the GP/(2\u03c0G\u03c1) and (2L, a, b) the length, inner and outer radii of\nthe\ncylinder,\nLockerbie et al formula, which is valid outside the sphere (S) of radius\n\u221a\nb2 + L2 and center at the origin, writes in terms of Legendre polynomials P2n as\n( n\n)\n\u221a\n\u221e\nX (\u22121)p (2n)!L2n\u22122p+1 (b2p+2 \u2212 a2p+2 ) P2n (z/ r2 + z 2 )\nX\n, (1)\nVLoc (r, z) =\n22p p!(p + 1)!(2n \u2212 2p + 1)!\n(r2 + z 2 )n+(1/2)\nn=0 p=0\nThe GP, VSch (r, z), by Schlamminger et al formula is expressed in\u221aterms of the\nGP along\u221a the axis of symmetry V (0, z). If we introduce f (x) = x + b2 + x2 and\ng(x) = x b2 + x2 , then V (0, z) & VSch (r, z) are evaluated by\n2V (0, z) = b2 {ln[f (z + L)] \u2212 ln[f (z \u2212 L)]} + g(z + L) \u2212 g(z \u2212 L) \u2212 (a \u2192 b) ,\nVSch (r, z) = V (0, z) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n V (2n) (0, z) 2n\nr , (Converges for small r) .\n22n (n!)2\nn=1\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere (a \u2192 b) substitutes a for b in the first four terms of (2).\nIn terms of the hypergeometric function 2 F1 [4], Selvaggi et al formula reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\n2\n2n+2\nG(r, u, n, a, b) = b\n2 F1 n + 1, 2n + (1/2); n + 2; \u2212b /(u + r ) \u2212 (a \u2192 b) ,\nVSel (r, z) =\n\n\u0012 \u00132n Z z+L\n\u221e\n1 X (4n \u2212 1)!!\nr\nG(r, u, n, a, b)\ndu .\n2\n2\n2 2n+(1/2)\n2 n=0 (n + 1)(n!)\n2\nz\u2212L (u + r )\n\n(4)\n\nWe consider the case where a = 1/2, b = 1 & L = 1, in SI units. We restrict\nourselves to the central plane z = 0 and compare the three formulae (1), (3) & (4)\nin their respective regions of convergence. We choose three points: P1 (0.2, 0) near\n\n\fComment on 'The Newtonian force experienced by a point mass near a finite cylindrical source'2\nthe z-axis, P2 (0.4, 0) near the inner surface of the cylinder and P3 (2, 0) outside the\ncylinder. If V (P, n + 1) denotes the potential at the point P with n + 1 being the\nnumber of terms used (here, n represents the index of summation which has been\ngiven the same symbol in all formulae (1), (3) & (4)), our results follow where the\nexact decimal places are underlined\nVSel (P1 , 4) \u2243 0.820253 ; VSel(P1 , 7) \u2243 0.820382 ; VSch (P1 , 3) \u2243 0.820385 ,\nVSel (P2 , 5) \u2243 0.825570 ; VSel(P2 , 7) \u2243 0.828583 ; VSch(P2 , 5) \u2243 0.831536 ,\nVSel (P3 , 7) \u2243 0.371846 ; VLoc (P3 , 7) \u2243 0.371958 .\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nVSch (P3 ) blows up and so do VLoc (P1 ) & VLoc (P2 ). The number of exact decimal places\nin (5) to (7) has been identified upon comparing VSch (P1 , 3), VSch (P2 , 5) & VLoc (P3 , 7)\nto more accurate results, which have been obtained at the same points using large\nvalues of n + 1 (see last paragraph). The relative errors at P are ESel\u2212Sch (P1 , 4) \u2243\n1.61 \u00d7 10\u22124 , ESel\u2212Sch(P2 , 7) \u2243 3.55 \u00d7 10\u22123 & ESel\u2212Loc (P3 , 7) \u2243 3.01 \u00d7 10\u22124 with\nESel\u2212Sch (P, n + 1) = |VSel (P, n + 1) \u2212 VSch (P, n + 1)|/VSch (P, n + 1), etc.\nNear the plane z = 0, the expansions (1) & (3) perform better than (4) (Eqs (5)\nto (7)) and are easily handled with reasonable evaluation times. The evaluation\nof each term in (4) involves a non-trivial integration which is time-consuming. In\ncontrast, (1) & (3) are evaluated via the use of Legendre polynomials, which are builtin functions in most computer algebra systems, or by differentiation. For instance, the\nevaluation of VSel (P2 , 7), by numerical integration, lasted more than 29000 times that\nof VSch (P2 , 7) (if we re-derive (2) using computer-algebra, this ratio reduces to 370)\nand the evaluation of VSel (P3 , 7) lasted more than 46000 times that of VLoc (P3 , 7).\nIn the plane z = 0 each term of (4) (n \u2265 1 up to at least 5) reaches a maximum\nvalue for a < r0 < b and decays slowly near and off the axis resulting in a slow\nconvergence of (4) around r0 . Off the plane z = 0, the convergence of (4) improves\naround the axis due to an off-axis shift of r0 and a drop in the maximum resulting\nin a rapid decay of its terms (n \u2265 1) there. At the point P4 (0.4, 2), we found\nVSel (P4 , 7) = 0.36482771, VSch (P4 , 7) = 0.36482771 & VLoc (P4 , 7) = 0.36482807. The\nevaluation of VSel (P4 , 7) lasted 8500 times that of VSch (P4 , 7) and 52000 times that of\nVLoc (P4 , 7).\nThe flexibility in using (1) or (3) allowed as to evaluate the GP using up to fortyone terms and to check over the stability of the results shown in (5) to (7) for VSch\n& VLoc . Moreover, the GP at each of the points P1 to P4 has been reobtained by\nnumerically integrating the volume integral of the potential element dv \u2032 /(2\u03c0|r \u2212 r\u2032 |).\nReferences\n[1] Lockerbie N A, Veryaskin and Xu X 1993 Class.
