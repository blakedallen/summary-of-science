Elkies\nJuly 2003\n\nAbstract. We give a new construction of nonlinear error-correcting\ncodes over suitable finite fields k from the geometry of modular\ncurves with many rational points over k, combining two recent improvements on Goppa's construction. The resulting codes are asymptotically the best currently known.\n\n1. Introduction.\n1.1 Review of Goppa's construction. Fix a finite field k of q = p\u03b1 elements.\nLet C be a (projective, smooth, irreducible) algebraic curve of genus g defined\nover k, with N rational points. It is known that\nN < (q 1/2 \u2212 1 + o(1))g\n\n(1)\n\nas g \u2192 \u221e (Drinfeld-Vl\u0103du\u0163 [1]). We say a curve of genus g \u2192 \u221e is \"asymptotically optimal\" if it has at least (q 1/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 o(1)) g rational points over k. If \u03b1 is\n\u221a\neven (that is, if q0 := q is an integer), then modular curves of various flavors\n- classical (elliptic), Shimura, or Drinfeld - attain\nN \u2265 (q0 \u2212 1)(g \u2212 1) = (q 1/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 o(1)) g\n\n(2)\n\n[10, 13], and are thus asymptotically optimal.\nLet D be a divisor on C of degree < N . Goppa ([8], see also [12]) regards the\nspace L(D) of sections of D as a linear code in k N , whose dimension r and\nminimal distance d satisfy r \u2265 deg(D) \u2212 g + 1 (by the Riemann-Roch theorem)\nand d \u2265 N \u2212 deg(D) (because a nonzero section of D has at most deg(D) zeros).\nThus the transmission rate R = r/N and the error-detection rate \u03b4 = d/N of\nGoppa's codes are related by\nR+\u03b4 >1\u2212\n\ng\n.\nN\n\n(3)\n\nThis lower bound improves as N/g increases. For q = q02 , we may take C\nasymptotically optimal, and find\nR+\u03b4 >1\u2212\n\n1\n\u2212 o(1)\nq0 \u2212 1\n\n(4)\n\nfor an infinite family of linear codes over k, which is the best that can be obtained\nfrom (3).\n1\n\n\fLet us say that (R0 , \u03b40 ) is asymptotically feasible if R0 , \u03b40 are positive and there\nexist arbitrarily long codes over k, linear or not, with1 R > R0 and \u03b4 > \u03b40 .\nThen Goppa's construction yields the asymptotic feasibility of (R0 , \u03b40 ) for any\npositive R0 , \u03b40 such that R0 + \u03b40 < 1 \u2212 (1/(q0 \u2212 1)). This is true because deg(D)\nis an arbitrary integer in (0, N ), and nontrivial (in the sense that such (R0 , \u03b40 )\nexist) once q0 > 2.\nBy comparison, a random code or random linear code of length N \u2192 \u221e and rate\nR has error-detection rate at least \u03b4 \u2212 o(1) with probability 1 \u2212 o(1) provided\n\u03b4 < (q \u2212 1)/q and R + Hq (\u03b4) < 1, where Hq is the normalized entropy function\nHq (\u03b4) := \u03b4 logq (q \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03b4 logq \u03b4 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) logq (1 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212\u03b4\n= \u03b4 logq (q \u2212 1)\n\u2212 logq (1 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\u03b4\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nN\n= lim N \u22121 logq\n.\nN\u2192 \u221e\n\u03b4N\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nTherefore if 0 < \u03b40 < (q \u2212 1)/q and 0 < R0 < 1 \u2212 Hq (\u03b40 ) then (R0 , \u03b40 ) is\nasymptotically feasible. This is the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.\nOnce q0 \u2265 7, Goppa's construction yields asymptotically feasible (R0 , \u03b40 ) beyond the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. This was the first construction to improve\non Gilbert-Varshamov in this sense, and it remains the only such construction\nthat yields linear codes.\n1.2 Beyond Goppa. For about 20 years Goppa's technique remained the best\nconstruction of codes over an alphabet of size q02 \u2265 49 beyond the GilbertVarshamov bound. Refinements concerned only algorithmic improvements, for\nexhibiting suitable curves C (see [2] for classical and Shimura curves, [3] for\nfurther Shimura curves, and [6, 7, 4, 12] for Drinfeld modular curves) and using\nthe resulting codes for error-resistant communication (polynomial-time encoding\nand decoding, see [9, 11]). In [5],2 we used rational functions on C to construct\nalgebraic-geometry codes over the (q + 1)-letter alphabet P1 (k) = k \u222a {\u221e}, and\ngave asymptotic estimates on their parameters R, \u03b4. We argued in [5] that these\ncodes improve on Goppa's in a range of parameters that includes all the Goppa\ncodes that improve on Gilbert-Varshamov; but our comparison was necessarily\nindirect due to the different alphabet sizes.\nEven more recently, Xing [14] gave a new construction of nonlinear algebraicgeometry codes over k. Like Goppa, Xing uses sections of line bundles, but he\ncleverly exploits the sections' derivatives to find codes with better asymptotic\nparameters than Goppa's. The Xing codes have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\nq\u22121\n1\nlogq 1 + 2i\n\u2212 o(1),\n(7)\nR+\u03b4 >1\u2212\n+\nq0 \u2212 1 i=2\nq\n1 As usual, the rate of a nonlinear code C \u2282 k n is defined by R = N \u22121 log (#C), which\nq\nequals r/N when C is linear.\n2 While [5] was the first publication, we obtained these results in the mid-1990's and included them in several conference and seminar talks starting in 1996.\n\n2\n\n\fwhich improves on (4) by\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\u22121\n1\nlogq 1 + 2i\ncq :=\n=\n(q \u22123 \u2212 q \u22124 + O(q \u22125 )).\nq\nlog\nq\ni=2\n\n(8)\n\nIn particular, this is the first construction of algebraic-geometry codes over a\n4-letter alphabet with R, \u03b4 both bounded away from zero. (Our codes over P1 (k)\nattained this for an alphabet of 5 letters.) Xing's construction does not require\nthat q = q02 , and yields an improvement of cq over the Goppa bound (3) for\nall q.\nIn this paper we obtain a further improvement, at least for q = q02 , by applying\nXing's technique to our codes of [5]. While those codes used an alphabet of\nq + 1 letters, our new codes CD (h) use the q-letter alphabet k, and can thus be\ncompared directly with Goppa's and Xing's codes. We find that when q = q02\nour CD (h) have parameters that improve on Xing's, replacing the sum (8) by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nlogq 1 + 3 =\n(q \u22123 \u2212 O(q \u22126 )).\n(9)\nq\nlog q\nWe conclude that (R0 , \u03b40 ) is asymptotically feasible for any positive R0 , \u03b40 such\nthat\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(10)\n+ logq 1 + 3 .\nR0 + \u03b40 < 1 \u2212\nq0 \u2212 1\nq\nThis also gives further support to our claim that the codes of [5] improve on\nGoppa's. Xing's refinement applies to both constructions and yields nonlinear\ncodes over the same alphabet, making possible a direct comparison in which the\ncodes of [5] come out ahead.\nLike the codes of [5] and (probably) [14], and unlike Goppa codes, our new codes\nCD (h) are still very far from any practical use: it is not even clear that one can\nefficiently encode integers in [1, (#CD (h))1\u2212o(1) ] or recognize whether a given\nword in k N is in that code, let alone solve the error-correcting problem.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first review the nonlinear\nalgebraic-geometry codes Cm , CD (h) of [14, 5]. We then combine these two constructions, and show that our new codes CD (h) attain the claimed improvement\nover Xing's codes.\nThis work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation (grant DMS0200687).\n\n2. Two variations on a theme of Goppa\n2.1 Xing: nonlinear codes from derivatives of sections. Let C be a\n(projective, smooth, irreducible) algebraic curve of genus g defined over k, with\nN rational points P1 , . . . , PN . For each j = 1, . . . , N , choose a local uniformizing\nparameter tj at Pj , that is, a rational function on C vanishing to order 1 at Pj .\n(Different choices of tj will yield isomorphic codes.) For any rational function\n3\n\n\f(r)\n\nf \u2208 k(C), let fj\n\n(r = 0, 1, 2, . . .) be the trj coefficient of its expansion in powers\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(3)\n\nof tj ; that is, fj = f (Pj ), and fj , fj , fj , . . . are chosen inductively so that\nP\n(r) \u0001\nt\u2212m\nf \u2212 0\u2264r<m fj trj is regular at Pj for all m.\nj\n\nLet D be a divisor on C. As in [14], we simplify the exposition by assuming that\nthe support of D is disjoint from C(k) = {P1 , . . . , PN }. (Little is lost by this\nassumption, because any divisor on C is linearly equivalent to one satisfying the\ndisjointness condition, and linearly equivalent divisors yield equivalent codes.)\nNote that we do not assume that deg(D) < N , and indeed we shall use divisors of\ndegree considerably larger than N . We denote by L(D) the vector space of global\nsections of D. For any distinct f, f \u2032 \u2208 L(D), the difference f \u2212 f \u2032 has a total\nof deg(D) zeros in C(k), counted with multiplicity. Goppa's construction does\nnot exploit multiplicity, using only the corollary that f (Pj ) = f \u2032 (Pj ) holds for\nat most deg(D) values of j. Multiple zeros are the key to Xing's improvement.\nFor r \u2265 0 define \u03c6r : L(D) \u2192 k N by\n(r)\n(r)\n(r) \u0001\n\u03c6r (f ) = f1 , f2 , . . . , fN .\n\nRecall that the Hamming distance d(*, *) on k N is defined by\n\b\nd(c, c\u2032 ) := # j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N } | cj 6= c\u2032j .\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nFor each positive integer m, Xing defines a code Cm as follows. For r =\n0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1, fix positive real numbers \u03c3r < (q \u2212 1)/q, which will be specified\nlater to optimize Cm . Choose cr \u2208 k N to maximize the size of\n\b\nMm := f \u2208 L(D) | d(cr , \u03c6r (f )) \u2264 \u03c3r N for each r = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1 , (13)\n\nand define\n\nCm := \u03c6m (Mm ).\n\n(14)\n\nAs (c0 , . . . , cm\u22121 ) varies over all q mN possible choices, the average size of Mm\nequals q \u2212mN #(L(D)) times the product of the sizes of closed Hamming balls of\nradius \u03c30 N , \u03c31 N , . . . , \u03c3m\u22121 N . The maximal Mm is therefore at least as large,\nso\n#Mm > q (H\u2212o(1))N #(L(D)),\n(15)\nwhere the negative number H is given in terms of the entropy function (5) by\nH=\n\nm\u22121\nX\nr=0\n\n(Hq (\u03c3r ) \u2212 1).\n\n(16)\n\nNow let f, f \u2032 be distinct functions in Mm , and for each r \u2265 0 let Ir be the set\n(r)\n(r)\nof i \u2208 {1, . . . , N } such that fj = fj\u2032 . If r < m then #Ir \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03c3r )N, since\nN \u2212 #Ir is the distance between the words \u03c6r (f ), \u03c6r (f \u2032 ) in the same Hamming\nball of radius \u03c3r N . On the other hand, the total number of zeros of f \u2212 f \u2032 at\nP1 , . . . , Pn , counted with multiplicity, is\n4\n\n\f\u221e\nX\ns=0\n\n#(\u2229sr=0 Ir ) \u2265\n\nm\nX\ns=0\n\ns\n\u0011\n\u0010\\\n#\nIr\nr=0\n\n\u2265\n\n(m + 1)N \u2212\n\n=\n\n(m + 1)N \u2212\n\n\u2265\n\ns\nm\nX\nX\n\ns=0\nm\nX\nr=0\n\nr=0\n\n!\n\n(N \u2212 #Ir )\n\n(17)\n\n(m + 1 \u2212 r)(N \u2212 #Ir )\n\nm\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nm\u22122\n(m + 1 \u2212 r)\u03c3r N + #Im .\nr=0\n\nSince this number may not exceed the degree of D, we deduce that\nm\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n#Im \u2264 deg(D) \u2212 m \u2212 2\n(m + 1 \u2212 r)\u03c3r N.\n\n(18)\n\nr=0\n\nDefine d0 , then, by\nm\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nd0 := m + 1 \u2212 2\n(m + 1 \u2212 r)\u03c3r N \u2212 deg(D).\n\n(19)\n\nr=0\n\nThen #Im \u2264 N \u2212 d0 . That is, d(\u03c6m (f ), \u03c6m (f \u2032 )) \u2265 d0 . Therefore Cm has\nminimum distance at least d0 .

Therefore \u03c6m is injective and\n#Cm = #Mm .\nIt remains to optimize deg(D) and \u03c3r given \u03b4 = d0 /N . By Riemann-Roch,\nL(D) is a k-vector space of dimension at least deg(D) \u2212 g + 1, with equality if\nD > 2g \u2212 2 (which will be the case for all D that we use). Combining this with\n(19) and the estimate (15) on #Mm , we find\nm\u22121\nX\n\u0001\nlogq #Cm\nd0\ng\nHq (\u03c3r ) \u2212 2(m + 1 \u2212 r)\u03c3r \u2212 o(1).\n+\n>1\u2212\n+\nN\nN\nN\nr=0\n\n(21)\n\nThe left-hand side is a lower bound on R + \u03b4 for the code Cm . If we take all\n\u03c3r = 0, the right-hand side reduces to 1 \u2212 (g/N ), and we recover the Goppa\nbound (3) - which is to be expected because in this case Cm is equivalent to the\nPN\nGoppa code L(D \u2212 m i=1 (Pj )) (this is most easily seen if we also choose each\ncr = 0). Since the derivative of Hq (\u03c3) \u2212 2(m + 1 \u2212 r) at \u03c3 = 0 is +\u221e for any\nm, r, there must exist positive \u03c3r that improve on Goppa. By differentiating\neach term of the sum in (21), Xing computed that the optimal choice is\n\u03c3r = (q \u2212 1)/(q 2(m+1\u2212r) + q \u2212 1),\n5\n\n(22)\n\n\fcorresponding to \u03c3r /(1 \u2212 \u03c3r ) = q \u22122(m+1\u2212r) (q \u2212 1). Using the equivalent formula\n(6) for Hq and taking i = m + 1 \u2212 r, the m-th term of (21) is seen to equal\nlogq (1 + q \u22122i (q \u2212 1)) at the optimal \u03c3r , whence the codes Cm attain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm+1\nX\n1\nq\u22121\nR+\u03b4 >1\u2212\nlogq 1 + 2i\n\u2212 o(1).\n(23)\n+\nq0 \u2212 1\nq\ni=2\n\nTaking m \u2192 \u221e and q = q02 recovers (7); without the hypothesis q = q02 , Xing's\nconstruction still improves on (3) by adding cq to the lower bound on R + \u03b4.\n2.2 Codes over P1 (k) from rational functions and sections.\n\nThe codes we introduced in [5] use rational functions on C instead of the global\nsections that comprise Goppa's codes. Let D be a divisor of degree zero on C.\nFor a nonnegative integer h, we define MD (h) to be the set of rational sections\nof degree \u2264 h of the line bundle LD associated to D. That is, MD (h) \u2282 k(C)\nconsists of the zero function together with the rational functions f on C whose\ndivisor (f ) is of the form E \u2212 D, where E is a divisor whose positive and\nnegative parts each have degree at most h. For instance, M0 (h) is the set of\nrational functions of degree at most h. Here, as opposed to [5], we do not assume\nthat h < N/2, and indeed we shall use considerably larger h.\nTo use these MD (h) for coding, we need an upper bound on the number of\nsolutions, with multiplicity, of f (P ) = f \u2032 (P ) for distinct rational sections f, f \u2032\nof LD , given the degrees of f and f \u2032 . We define this multiplicity as follows. For\neach P \u2208 C(k) choose a rational function \u03c6P whose divisor has the same order\nat P as D. (The definition will be clearly independent of the choice of \u03c6P .)\nThen P is a solution of f = f \u2032 if the rational functions \u03c6P f and \u03c6P f \u2032 have\nthe same value, finite or infinite, at P . In the former case, the multiplicity is\nthe valuation of (\u03c6P f ) \u2212 (\u03c6P f \u2032 ) at P . In the latter case, the multiplicity is the\nvaluation of (\u03c6P f )\u22121 \u2212 (\u03c6P f \u2032 )\u22121 at P . Of course if P is not a solution of f = f \u2032\nthen its multiplicity is zero.\nProposition. Suppose f, f \u2032 are distinct rational sections of LD , with degrees\nh, h\u2032 . P\nFor P \u2208 C(k) let m(P ) be the multiplicity of P as a solution of f = f \u2032 .\nThen P \u2208C(k) m(P ) = h + h\u2032 .\n\nProof. For P \u2208 C(k), if P is a pole of \u03c6P f , let \u03bc(P ) be the multiplicity of\nthis pole,P\nand otherwise set \u03bc(P ) = 0; define \u03bc\u2032 (P ) likewise using \u03c6P f \u2032 . Then\n\u2032\nh + h = P \u2208C(k) (\u03bc(P ) + \u03bc\u2032 (P )). But we claim that m(P ) \u2212 (\u03bc(P ) + \u03bc\u2032 (P )) is\nthe valuation at P of \u03c6P f \u2212 \u03c6P f \u2032 , considered also as a rational section of LD .\nThis claim is immediate if neither \u03c6P f nor \u03c6P f \u2032 has a pole at P ; if just one\nof them has a pole there then \u03c6P f \u2212 \u03c6P f \u2032 has a pole of the same order, which\nequals \u03bc(P )+ \u03bc\u2032 (P ), while m(P ) = 0; finally, if both \u03c6P f, \u03c6P f \u2032 have poles at P ,\nthen m(P ) > 0, and the claim follows from the identity\n(\u03c6P f )\u22121 \u2212 (\u03c6P f \u2032 )\u22121 =\n\n(\u03c6P f \u2032 ) \u2212 (\u03c6P f )\n(\u03c6P f \u2032 )(\u03c6P f )\n\nby taking valuations at P . This establishes our claim in all cases. But the sum\n6\n\n\fP\nover P \u2208 C(k) of vP (\u03c6P f \u2212 \u03c6P f \u2032 ) vanishes, since P \u2208C(k) vP (f \u2212 f \u2032 ) = 0 while\nP\nP \u2208C(k) vP (\u03c6P ) = deg(D) was also assumed to equal zero. Since\nX\nP\n\nvP (\u03c6P f \u2212 \u03c6P f \u2032 ) =\n\nX\nP\n\n\u0001 X\nm(P ) \u2212 (\u03bc(P ) + \u03bc\u2032 (P )) =\nm(P ) \u2212 (h + h\u2032 ),\nP\n\nthis proves that m(P ) = h + h\u2032 . \u2737\nRemark. This result is the analogue for rational sections of the fact that a\nnonzero element of L(D) has deg(D) zeros counted with multiplicity. It refines\nProposition 1 of [5], where we showed only that f = f \u2032 has at most h + h\u2032\nsolutions not counting multiplicity.\n\u0001N\nIn particular, if 2h < N then the evaluation\nmap \u03c60 : MD (h) \u2192 P1 (k)\n\u0001\ntaking f to (\u03c6P1 f )(P1 ), . . . , (\u03c6PN f )(PN ) is injective, and its image is a code\nof length N over P1 (k) with minimal distance at least N \u2212 2h. We call this code\nCD (h). Note that it is 2h, rather than h, that plays the role analogous to the\ndegree of the divisor on Goppa's construction; the notation h should suggest\nboth the height of a rational section of LD and half of the degree of Goppa's\ndivisor.\nWe also need the size of this code. It turns out to be easier, though still far\nfrom trivial, to estimate not individual #MD (h) but the average of #MD (h)\nas D ranges over (representatives of) the Jacobian JC , which is the group of\nequivalence classes of degree-zero divisors on C. We quote the following from\n[5, Thm.1]:3\nIf C is asymptotically optimal (i.e., if C varies in a family of curves\nof genus g \u2192 \u221e with N \u223c (q 1/2 \u22121)g rational points), and for each C\nwe choose h with \u03c1 = inf(h/N ) > q/(q 2 \u2212 1), then the average over\nD \u2208 JC of #MD (h) is\n\u0012\n\nq+1\nq\n\n\u0013N \u00b1o\u03c1 (N )\n\nq 2h\u2212g .\n\n(24)\n\nHence there exist D for which MD (h) has size at least (24), which exceeds\n\u0001N \u2212o\u03c1 (N )\nby a factor of (q + 1)/q\nthe Riemann-Roch estimate on the size of\nL(D) when deg(D) = 2h. Note that we do not require that 2h < N . We\nshall use the result also for some h \u2265 N/2, in which case we cannot deduce a\nlower bound on CD (h) (and anyway we have no nontrivial lower bound on the\nminimal distance of CD (h)), but will be able to construct another code CD (h)\nby adapting Xing's technique.\n3 For individual codes, see [5, Thm.2], which gives the same estimate but only with a\nmuch higher threshold on \u03c1. Since we later use Xing's technique, which requires an averaging\nargument, we would gain little by citing here an estimate on #MD (h) free of averaging.\nTherefore we do not invoke [5, Thm.2] in our present application.\n\n7\n\n\f3. New nonlinear codes over k\nWe again regard the evaluation map \u03c60 on MD (h) as the first of an infinite series\n\u03c60 , \u03c61 , \u03c62 , . . . that records not just the values but also the derivatives of rational\n\u0001N\nsections of D at P1 , . . . , PN . While \u03c60 takes values in P1 (k) , the \u03c6r for\nr > 0 take values in k N ; this is why we construct codes with alphabet k rather\nthan P1 (k). We define \u03c61 , \u03c62 , . . . as follows. If (\u03c6Pj f )(Pj ) = \u221e then the j-th\ncoordinate of \u03c6r (f ) is the trj coefficient of the expansion of (\u03c6Pj f )\u22121 in powers\nof tj . Otherwise that coordinate is the trj coefficient of the expansion of \u03c6Pj f .\nIn either case, Pj is a solution of f = f \u2032 of multiplicity m if and only if the\nj-th coordinates of \u03c6r (f ), \u03c6r (f \u2032 ) coincide for 0 \u2264 r < m but not for r = m. As\nin [14], we could have dispensed with the \u03c6Pj by choosing a linearly equivalent\nD whose support is disjoint from {P1 , . . . , PN }.\n\u0001N\nFix positive \u03c30 < q/(q + 1). Choose c0 \u2208 P1 (k) to maximize the size of\n\b\nMD (h) := f \u2208 MD (h) | d(c0 , \u03c60 (f )) \u2264 \u03c30 N ,\n(25)\nand define\n\nCD (h) := \u03c61 (MD (h)).\n\n(26)\n\nAs c0 varies over all (q + 1)N possible choices, the average size of MD (h) equals\n(q + 1)\u2212N #(MD (h)) times size of the closed Hamming ball of radius \u03c30 N in\n\u0001N\nP1 (k) . The maximal MD (h) is therefore at least as large, so\n#MD (h) > (q + 1)(Hq+1 (\u03c30 )\u22121\u2212o(1))N #(MD (h)).\n\n(27)\n\nIf moreover C is asymptotically optimal and h \u2265 \u03c1N for some \u03c1 > q/(q 2 \u2212 1),\nthen there exists D such that #(MD (h)) is bounded below by (24). We then\nhave\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n#MD (h) > q 2h\u2212g exp N log(q + 1)Hq+1 (\u03c30 ) \u2212 log q \u2212 o\u03c1 (1) .\n(28)\nWe next fix d0 > 0 and show that if\n\n2h \u2264 (2 \u2212 4\u03c30 )N \u2212 d0\n\n(29)\n\nthen \u03c61 is injective on MD (h) and its image CD (h) is a code of minimum\ndistance at least d0 . We have seen that for any distinct f, f \u2032 \u2208 MD (h) the\ntotal multiplicity of solutions of f = f \u2032 is at most 2h. If f, f \u2032 \u2208 MD (h) then\nf (Pj ) = f \u2032 (Pj ) for at least N \u2212 2\u03c30 N values of j. For at least\nN \u2212 2\u03c30 N \u2212 d(\u03c61 (f ), \u03c61 (f \u2032 ))\nof these, the j-th coordinates of \u03c61 (f ) and \u03c61 (f \u2032 ) also coincide, so Pj is a solution\nof f = f \u2032 of multiplicity at least 2. Hence\n(2 \u2212 4\u03c30 )N \u2212 d(\u03c61 (f ), \u03c61 (f \u2032 )) \u2264 2h.\n8\n\n\fTherefore if (29) holds then d(\u03c61 (f ), \u03c61 (f \u2032 )) \u2265 d0 , which proves are claim that\n\u03c61 maps MD (h) injectively to a code of minimum distance \u2265 d0 . (This is of\ncourse a direct adaptation of the case m = 1 of Xing's argument, which is\nTheorem 1.2 and \u00a7II of his paper [14].)\n\nFinally we take d0 = \u03b4N , let 2h = (2 \u2212 4\u03c30 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 o(1))N , and optimize \u03c30 .\nCombining our results thus far, we have\nlogq #Cm\ng\n+\u03b4 >1\u2212\n+ logq (q + 1) * Hq+1 (\u03c30 ) \u2212 4\u03c30 \u2212 o\u03c1 (1).\nN\nN\n\n(30)\n\nIf we took \u03c30 = 0, we would again recover the Goppa bound (4).4 Since the\nderivative with respect to \u03c30 of the bound (30) is +\u221e, the optimal \u03c30 must\nimprove on (4) as was the case for Xing's construction. The resulting bound\nimproves on Xing's because (30) involves the entropy function for an alphabet\nof q +1 letters rather than q. Here we calculate that the optimal \u03c30 is 1/(q 3 +1),\ncorresponding to \u03c30 /(1 \u2212 \u03c30 ) = q \u22123 . Substituting this into (30) we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nlogq #Cm\ng\n1\n(31)\n+\u03b4 >1\u2212\n+ logq 1 + 3 \u2212 o\u03c1 (1).\nN\nN\nq\nWith this choice of \u03c30 , the ratio 2h/N easily exceeds the threshold of 2q/(q 2 \u22121)\neven for \u03b4 = 1 as long as q0 \u2265 4. (We must in any event exclude q = 2 or 3,\nbecause for those q none of the methods described here could yield codes with\npositive R, \u03b4 even if asymptotically optimal curves were known.)\nWe have therefore proved:\nTheorem. Let q0 be a prime power, and k a finite field of q 2 elements. For all\npositive R0 , \u03b40 satisfying (10), and any N0 , there exist a curve C/k, a degree-zero\ndivisor D on C, and a positive integer h, such that CD (h) is a code whose length\nN , transmission rate R, and error-detection rate \u03b4 = d/N satisfy N > N0 ,\nR > R0 , and \u03b4 > \u03b40 . In particular, all positive (R0 , \u03b40 ) satisfying (10) are\nasymptotically feasible.\nAs noted already, this construction corresponds to the case m = 1 of Xing's\ncodes. One can formulate such a construction for any m, but with worse\nresults, because only \u03c30 increases, and the resulting improvement falls off as\nq \u22122m\u22122 / log(q) when m grows. Can multiplicities of order > 2 be exploited to\nyield even better codes?\n\nReferences\n[1] Drinfeld, V.G., Vl\u0103du\u0163, S.G.: The number of points of an algebraic curve.\nFunctional Anal.
