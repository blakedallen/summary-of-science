Our data are drawn from the Keck Baryonic Structure\nSurvey (KBSS), which has been optimized to examine the small-scale interplay between galaxies\nand the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the peak of the galaxy formation era at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3.\nIn this work, we use the positions and spectroscopic redshifts of 1558 galaxies that lie within \u223c3\u2032\n(4.2h\u22121 comoving Mpc; cMpc) of the hyperluminous QSO (HLQSO) sightline in one of 15 independent\nsurvey fields, together with new measurements of the HLQSO systemic redshifts. By combining\nthe spatial and redshift distributions, we measure the galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation function, the\ngalaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function, and the characteristic scale of galaxy overdensities surrounding\nthe sites of exceedingly rare, extremely rapid, black hole accretion. On average, the HLQSOs lie\nwithin significant galaxy overdensities, characterized by a velocity dispersion \u03c3v \u2243 200 km s\u22121 and\na transverse angular scale of \u223c25\u2032\u2032 (\u223c200 physical kpc).

The galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation function has a best-fit\ncorrelation length r0GQ = (7.3 \u00b1 1.3)h\u22121 cMpc, while the galaxy autocorrelation measured from the\nspectroscopic galaxy sample in the same fields has r0GG = (6.0\u00b10.5)h\u22121 cMpc. Based on a comparison\nwith simulations evaluated at z \u223c 2.6, these values imply that a typical galaxy lives in a host halo\nwith log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 11.9\u00b10.1, while HLQSOs inhabit host halos of log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 12.3\u00b10.5. In spite\nof the extremely large black hole masses implied by their observed luminosities [log(MBH /M\u2299 ) & 9.7],\nit appears that HLQSOs do not require environments very different from their much less luminous\nQSO counterparts. Evidently, the exceedingly low space density of HLQSOs (. 10\u22129 cMpc\u22123 ) results\nfrom a one-in-a-million event on scales << 1 Mpc, and not from being hosted by rare dark matter\nhalos.\nSubject headings: galaxies: high redshift \u2013 quasars: general \u2013 large-scale structure of universe\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of galaxies with supermassive black holes\nhas become a topic of considerable interest, particularly\nsince the discovery that properties of these black holes\nare strongly correlated with those of their host galaxies (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Gebhardt et al. 2000;\nFerrarese & Merritt 2000). The processes of supermassive black hole accretion and growth can produce spectacularly luminous QSOs, allowing their study over vast\ncosmological volumes (0 < z . 7). The details of these\naccretion processes, however, are concealed not only by\ndistance, but also by our lack of knowledge concerning\nthe duty cycle of AGN and the environments that drive\nand sustain their growth.\nBecause the brightest QSOs are extreme, ultraluminous objects, it is often assumed that they must inhabit comparably rare environments. In particular, the\nrarity of these objects could arise because they require\nthe highest mass dark matter halos, which are highly\nbiased with respect to the overall matter distribution,\nor because of other, finely-tuned environmental factors\nthat influence the availability of gas and the propensity\n1 Based on data obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory,\nwhich is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and\nNASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support\nof the W.M. Keck Foundation.\n\nfor the black hole to accrete. As such, the masses and\nspatial distribution of the dark matter halos that host\nQSOs are of considerable interest, and detailed statistics on these quantities have become available through\nlarge-scale surveys, primarily through studies of QSO\nclustering using the two-point correlation function. Recent surveys have covered wide regions of the sky and\nlarge ranges of redshift e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000; Eisenstein et al. 2011), the\n2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ; Croom et al. 2004), and\nthe DEEP2 Redshift Survey (Davis et al. 2003).\nBecause these surveys include QSOs with a wide range\nof luminosities and redshifts, the QSO autocorrelation\nfunction has been frequently used to constrain QSO clustering out to high redshifts using the SDSS samples\n(e.g. Myers et al. 2006, 2007; Shen et al. 2007, 2010;\nRoss et al. 2009), 2QZ samples (e.g. Porciani et al. 2004;\nPorciani & Norberg 2006; Croom et al. 2005), and combined 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO survey (2SLAQ; survey description in Croom et al. 2009, clustering results\nin da \u00c2ngela et al. 2008). The results of these analyses\nare in broad agreement that QSOs inhabit host dark matter halos of mass log(Mh /M\u2299 )\u223c12.5 at redshifts z . 3.\nDue to the low space density of QSOs at all redshifts,\nthese autocorrelation measurements have generally been\nconfined to large scales, but complementary measurements have also been obtained: Hennawi et al. (2006)\n\n\f2\n\nTrainor & Steidel\n\nand Shen et al. (2010) conducted surveys for close QSO\npairs; the galaxy-QSO cross-correlation function was\nmeasured by Adelberger & Steidel (2005), in the DEEP2\nsurvey at z \u223c 1 by Coil et al. (2007), and in a low redshift\n(z < 0.6) SDSS QSO sample by Padmanabhan et al.\n(2009). These studies generally agree with the QSO autocorrelation results, and the mass scale log(Mh /M\u2299 )\u223c12.5\nseems fairly well-established for the general population of\nQSOs at z . 3.\nHowever, studies which divide the population of QSOs\ninto specific subsamples reveal a more complicated picture of the dependence of QSO properties on halo mass.\nLow-redshift studies display a possible relation between\nobscuration and host halo mass (Hickox et al. 2011),\nwhich may be significant at higher redshifts, where the\npopulation of obscured QSOs is relatively unconstrained.\nShen et al. (2010) find that radio-loud QSOs are more\nstrongly clustered than radio-quiet QSOs matched in redshift and optical luminosity. In addition, there is an\nexpected dependence of QSO luminosity on host halo\nmass because the QSO luminosity depends on black hole\nmass, which in turn exhibits the aforementioned association with the mass of the host halo. In practice, however, QSO luminosities depend in detail on the availability of matter to accrete and the physical processes governing the efficiency with which this accretion occurs.\nThus, it is perhaps not surprising that the clustering of\nQSOs shows little association with QSO luminosity in\nobservations near z \u223c 2 (e.g. Adelberger & Steidel 2005;\nCroom et al. 2005; da \u00c2ngela et al. 2008 and in simulations by Lidz et al. 2006); however, Shen et al. (2010) detect stronger clustering among the most luminous QSOs\nin their sample at z > 2.9, and Krumpe et al. (2010) find\nthat SDSS QSOs at z \u223c 0.25 cluster more strongly with\nincreasing X-ray luminosity. Finally, the survey of close\nQSO pairs by Hennawi et al. (2006) reveals an excess at\nthe smallest scales, which the authors attribute to dissipative interaction events that trigger QSO activity in\nrich environments. In short, the properties of QSOs are\nrelated to their host halo masses in a complex manner,\nand it is clear that other environmental factors are in\nplay.\nIn this paper we study the environments of hyperluminous QSOs (HLQSOs; defined here by a luminosity\nlog(\u03bdL\u03bd /L\u2299 )&14 at a rest-frame wavelength of 1450 \u00c5)\nat 2.5 . z . 3 by measuring the magnitude and scale\nof overdensities in the galaxy distribution at small (.3\u2032 )\nprojected distances using data from the Keck Baryonic\nStructure Survey (KBSS). This approach complements\nexisting studies in numerous ways: targeting narrow\nfields allows us to study the local environments of these\nextremely rare HLQSOs, including the galaxies at comparable redshifts that lie far below the flux limits of the\ntypical wide-field QSO surveys. In this way we are able\nto constrain the properties of the relatively unexplored\nenvironments of the highest-luminosity QSOs. Focusing on the brightest QSOs should reveal whether host\nhalo mass plays a significant role in determining QSO\nproperties, while sensitivity to the local environment may\ndemonstrate whether these HLQSOs are associated with\nthe types of environments where mergers and dissipative\ninteraction are expected to be most common.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in \u00a72 we discuss the\n\nobservations used in this study; \u00a73 describes the techniques used to construct an unbiased measure of the\ngalaxy distribution around the HLQSOs and our estimates of the magnitude and scale of the surrounding\ngalaxy overdensities. In \u00a74, we describe and implement\na method for estimating the small-scale galaxy-HLQSO\ncorrelation function and galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation\nfunction from our data along with the implied galaxy\nand HLQSO host halo masses. In \u00a75 we present evidence\nthat the HLQSOs inhabit group-sized virialized structures conducive to merger events; a summary is given in\n\u00a76. Throughout this paper, we will assume \u03a9m = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and h = H0 /(100 km s\u22121 ). We have left all\ncomoving length scales in terms of h for ease of comparison to previous studies, but we quote physical scales,\nluminosities, and halo masses assuming h = 0.7. For further clarity, we denote comoving distance scales in units\nof cMpc (comoving Mpc) and physical scales as pkpc\n(physical kpc).\n2. DATA\n\nThe data used in this study form part of the Keck\nBaryonic Structure Survey (KBSS; Steidel et al. 2012), a\nlarge sample (Ngal = 2298) of high-redshift star-forming\ngalaxies (1.5 < z < 3.6) close to the lines-of-sight of 15\nHLQSOs at redshifts 2.5<z<2.9. Because we have observed fields of differing solid angle around each of these\nHLQSOs, we standardized the fields for the purposes of\nthis study by including only those galaxies within \u03b4\u03b8 \u223c 3\u2032\n(4.2h\u22121 cMpc at the HLQSO redshifts) of the line-ofsight of the HLQSO in each, an area that is well-sampled\nfor all 15 fields. This subset of the total KBSS dataset\ncontains 1558 galaxies and comprises the entire sample\nused in this paper.\n2.1. HLQSO Redshifts\nAn important prerequisite to establishing the galaxy\nenvironment of the HLQSOs is an accurate measurement of the HLQSO systemic redshifts. Redshifts for\nQSOs in the range 2 . zQSO . 3 are typically measured from the peaks or centroids of broad emission lines\nof relatively high ionization species in the rest-frame\nfar-UV (e.g., N V \u03bb1240, C IV \u03bb1549, Si IV \u03bb1399,\nC III] \u03bb1909). These lines are known to yield redshifts\nthat differ significantly from systemic, and tend to be\nblue-shifted by several hundred to several thousand km\ns\u22121 (see e.g. McIntosh et al. 1999; Richards et al. 2002;\nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2008). These velocity offsets also tend to\nincrease with QSO luminosity, thus making the present\nsample of hyperluminous QSOs particularly susceptible\nto this issue. In view of the importance of precise redshifts to locate the HLQSO environments within the survey volume, we obtained near-IR spectra of the entire\nsample using NIRSPEC on the Keck II 10m telescope,\nTripleSpec on the Palomar 200-inch (5m) telescope, and\nin some cases, both (see Table 1).\nAmong the 15 HLQSOs in the sample, narrow forbidden lines ([O III] \u03bb5007) were detected for only 2 of them\n(Q1623+268, Q2343+12), either because no such lines\nwere present in the spectra (common at the highest luminosities), or because the HLQSO redshift was such that\nthe strongest transitions fell in regions between the nearIR atmospheric bands. However, in all cases we were able\nto measure one or more hydrogen Balmer lines and the\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1\nHLQSO Redshifts and Corrections\nQSO\n\nNIR Spectra Sourcea\n\nz new b\n\nz old c\n\n\u2206z\n\nQ0100+13 (PHL957)\nHS0105+1619\nQ0142\u221210 (UM673a)\nQ0207\u2212003 (UM402)\nQ0449\u22121645\nQ0821+3107 (NVSS)\nQ1009+29 (CSO 38)\nSBS1217+490\nHS1442+2931\nHS1549+1919\nHS1603+3820\nQ1623+268 (KP77)d\nHS1700+6416\nQ2206\u2212199 (LBQS)\nQ2343+12 (also SDSS)\n\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nP200/TSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\nKeck II/NIRSPEC\n\n2.721 \u00b1 0.003\n2.652 \u00b1 0.003\n2.743 \u00b1 0.003\n2.872 \u00b1 0.003\n2.684 \u00b1 0.003\n2.616 \u00b1 0.003\n2.652 \u00b1 0.003\n2.704 \u00b1 0.003\n2.660 \u00b1 0.003\n2.843 \u00b1 0.003\n2.551 \u00b1 0.003\n2.5353 \u00b1 0.0005\n2.751 \u00b1 0.003\n2.573 \u00b1 0.003\n2.573 \u00b1 0.003\n\n2.681\n2.640\n2.731\n2.850\n2.600\n2.624\n2.620\n2.698\n2.638\n2.830\n2.510\n2.518\n2.736\n2.558\n2.515\n\n\u22120.040\n\u22120.012\n\u22120.012\n\u22120.022\n\u22120.084\n+0.008\n\u22120.032\n\u22120.006\n\u22120.022\n\u22120.013\n\u22120.041\n\u22120.018\n\u22120.015\n\u22120.015\n\u22120.058\n\n\u2206v (km s\u22121 )\n\u22123214\n\u2212983\n\u2212943\n\u22121699\n\u22126818\n+686\n\u22122620\n\u2212484\n\u22121797\n\u22121011\n\u22123452\n\u22121489\n\u22121220\n\u22121255\n\u22124854\n\na\n\nRefers to the instrument used to measure the near-IR QSO spectra and redshift.

The redshifts obtained from the\nBalmer/Mg II lines (which agree well with that given\nby [O III] in the two cases where all were measured)\nwere then subjected to several cross-checks, including:\nthe wavelength at the onset of the Lyman-\u03b1 forest measured from the high resolution HLQSO spectra (a lower\nlimit on the systemic redshift, but one which agrees to\nwithin \u2206z \u2243 0.001 of the Balmer line redshift in all but\n2 cases); the redshift of narrow He II \u03bb1640 in intermediate resolution optical spectra of the HLQSOs; and,\nin several cases, regions exhibiting narrow Ly\u03b1 emission\nwere discovered with small angular separations from the\nHLQSO, and we have found that such nebulae lie very\nclose to the systemic redshift of the nearby HLQSO. In\n2 cases (HS1603+3820 and Q1009+29) this last criterion led to a significant modification (\u2206z \u223c +0.01, or\n\u223c 800 km s\u22121 ) of the redshift suggested by the near-IR\nspectroscopy. We adopt a HLQSO redshift uncertainty\n\u03c3z = 270 km s\u22121 (for those HLQSOs without measured\n[O III] redshifts) based on the measured dispersion of\nthe Mg II line with respect to [O III] by Richards et al.\n(2002); the broad agreement among our many redshift\ncriteria suggest that this is a conservative estimate of\nthe redshift uncertainties.\nTable 1 summarizes the adopted redshifts for all 15\nHLQSOs based on these considerations; also given (column 4; zold ) is the published redshift for each and the\nredshift and velocity error that would result from adopting the published values (\u2206z \u2261 zold \u2212znew ). As expected,\nall but one of the old redshifts are systematically too low\n(the median shift is \u223c \u22121500 km s\u22121 , and the mean\n\u223c \u22122100 km s\u22121 ). Failure to account for these large\nvelocity errors would severely compromise our measurements. As we show below, the measured zQSO values\nmust be quite accurate given the very tight redshift-space\ncorrelation between the HLQSOs and the spectroscopically measured, continuum-selected galaxies nearby.\n2.2. Galaxy Redshifts\n\nGalaxy redshifts were measured using low-resolution\n(\u223c5\u00c5), rest-frame UV spectra obtained with the LRIS\nmulti-object spectrograph on the Keck I telescope\n(Oke et al. 1995; Steidel et al. 2004). Candidate galaxies were color-selected using the Lyman-break technique\nand were sorted as BX (z \u223c 2.2), MD (z \u223c 2.6), or CDM\n(z \u223c 3) galaxies based on the color criteria discussed\nin Steidel et al. (2003) and Adelberger et al. (2004); the\ndata collection and reduction procedures are described\ntherein. All galaxies in the spectroscopic sample have\nR < 25.5 [where R \u2261 mAB (6830\u00c5)], which corresponds\nto MAB (1700\u00c5) . \u221219.9 at z \u223c 2.7 (about 1 magnitude\nfainter than M\u2217 at this redshift; see Reddy et al. 2008).\nRedshifts were determined by a combination of Ly\u03b1 emission or absorption and far-UV interstellar (IS) absorption. Since Ly\u03b1 emission tends to be redshifted with\nrespect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy, and\ninterstellar absorption tends to be blueshifted (see e.g.\nShapley et al. 2003; Adelberger et al. 2003; Steidel et al.\n2010), we estimate each galaxy's systemic redshift via\nthe method proposed in Adelberger et al. (2005a) and\n\nupdated by Steidel et al. (2010). In this method, the\naverage Ly\u03b1 emission and IS absorption offsets are calculated based on the redshift of the H\u03b1 nebular line (NIR\nspectroscopy is available for a subset of the galaxy sample), which traces ionized gas in star-forming regions of\nthe galaxy, and is thus a more accurate estimate of the\nsystemic redshift. Rakic et al. (2011) derive similar corrections for the same galaxy sample using the expected\nsymmetry of IGM absorption about the systemic redshift\nof the galaxy.\nWe estimate the systemic galaxy redshifts (zgal ) based\non a combination of the above results. A more detailed\ndiscussion of our correction formulae can be found in\nRudie et al. (2011; in prep.), but the formulae are reproduced below. For galaxies with NIR spectra (e.g. the\nH\u03b1 line), the NIR redshift is used with no correction.\nFor galaxies with measured Ly\u03b1 emission but without\ninterstellar absorption, we use the following estimate:\n\u2206vLy\u03b1\n(1 + zLy\u03b1 )\n(1)\nc\nwhere zLy\u03b1 is the redshift of the measured Ly\u03b1 emission\nand \u2206vLy\u03b1 = \u2212300 km s\u22121 is the velocity shift needed\nto transform the Ly\u03b1 redshift to the systemic value, zgal .\nFor galaxies with interstellar absorption, we use an estimate based on the absorption redshift whether or not\nLy\u03b1 emission is present:\nzgal \u2261 zLy\u03b1 +\n\n\u2206vIS\n(1 + zIS )\n(2)\nc\nwhere zIS is the redshift of the measured interstellar absorption and \u2206vLy\u03b1 = 160 km s\u22121 is the velocity shift\nneeded to transform the absorption redshift to the systemic value.\nFor galaxies with both interstellar absorption and Ly\u03b1\nemission, we verify that the corrected absorption redshift\ndoes not exceed the measured redshift of the Ly\u03b1 line;\nthat is, we verify that zIS < zgal < zLy\u03b1 , where zgal is\ncalculated using Eq. 2 above. If this condition is not\nsatisfied, we recompute the galaxy systemic redshift as\nthe average of the absorption and emission redshifts:\nzgal \u2261 zIS +\n\nzIS + zLy\u03b1\n.\n(3)\n2\nThe residual redshift errors (calculated from the galaxies in the NIR sample) have a standard deviation\n\u03c3v,err = 125 km s\u22121 , which we adopt as the uncertainty\nin our galaxy redshift measurements.\nzgal \u2261\n\n3. REDSHIFT OVERDENSITY\n\nIn order to consider the positions of the galaxies relative to their corresponding HLQSOs in redshift space\nwhile accounting for the differences in the HLQSO redshifts between fields, the redshift of each galaxy was\ntransformed into a velocity relative to its associated\nHLQSO. For a galaxy with index i in a field with index\nj, this velocity difference is given by\n\u03b4vi,j =\n\nc\n(zgal,i \u2212 zQSO,j ) .\n1 + zQSO,j\n\n(4)\n\nOnce transformed to units of velocity, the distributions\nof galaxies relative to their HLQSOs were stacked to re-\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\n\nFig. 1.- Velocity distribution of galaxies with respect to their\nnearest HLQSOs, stacked for all 15 HLQSO fields. The velocity \u03b4v\nis given by Eq. 4, where \u03b4v = 0 for a galaxy at the redshift of its\ncorresponding HLQSO. The yellow shaded area corresponds to the\nselection function, constructed as described in \u00a73.1. The dashed\ncurve is a gaussian profile fit to the overdensity, with \u03c3v,fit = 350\nkm s\u22121 . After removing the effect of our \u03c3v,err \u223c 125 km s\u22121 (270\nkm s\u22121 ) galaxy (HLQSO) redshift errors, we estimate a peculiar\nvelocity scale of \u03c3v,pec \u2243 200 km s\u22121 for the galaxies associated\nwith the overdensity, with an offset h\u03b4vi = 106\u00b154 km s\u22121 from\nthe HLQSO redshifts.\n\nveal the average environment of HLQSOs in terms of the\nlocal galaxy number density (per unit velocity)\u2013this distribution is shown in Fig. 1. The distribution shows a\nwell-defined peak near \u03b4v = 0, indicating the presence of\nsignificant clustering of the galaxies around the HLQSO\nredshifts. We attribute the slight offset of the overdensity from the HLQSO redshifts (fit h\u03b4vi = 106\u00b154 km\ns\u22121 ) to a residual systematic offset in our determination\nof the HLQSO redshifts.\n3.1. Building the Selection Function\n\nClustering measurements can be grossly misinterpreted\nwhen the relevant selection functions are not wellunderstood (Adelberger 2005). While the criteria for selecting galaxies for follow-up spectroscopy were identical\nfor all 15 of the KBSS fields, small differences in image\ndepth and seeing, as well as slight changes in the algorithms used for assigning relative weights in the process\nof designing slit masks, can lead to field-to-field variations in the redshift selection functions. To at least\npartially mitigate such variations in the redshift-space\nsampling between fields, we used the number of successfully observed BX, MD and CDM galaxies in each field\nto estimate the form of our field-specific selection functions Nj (z). These estimates of the selection functions\nwere constructed as follows.\nFirst, the redshift distributions of all BX, MD and\nCDM galaxies in our sample were arranged in a coarse\nhistogram with bins of width \u2206z = 0.2. A spline fit\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- Redshift distributions for BX, MD, and CDM colorselected galaxy types. Red histograms display the measured distributions of all such galaxies in each sample, while the yellow region\nrepresents the fit spline function specific to the color-selected sample (ie. NBX (z), NMD (z), and NCDM (z)). The blue hashed region\nis the overall redshift selection function for all color types.\n\nwas then performed to estimate the smooth distribution\nfunctions of each galaxy type\u2013the histograms and spline\nfits for each type are displayed in Fig. 2.\nFor each field, we built a field-specific selection function\nby combining these galaxy redshift distributions for each\ncolor criterion according to the number of those galaxies\nsuccessfully observed in the field. Thus for a field with\nindex j, the redshift selection function is given by Eq. 5:\nNj (z) = NBX,j NBX (z) +\nNMD,j NMD (z) +\nNCDM,j NCDM (z)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere NBX,j corresponds to the number of BX-selected\ngalaxies in field j, NBX is the selection function for BXselected galaxies over all fields, and other variables are\ndefined similarly. We then transform these redshift-space\nselection functions into units of velocity relative to their\ncorresponding bright HLQSOs using Eq. 4. Finally, we\ncombined this set of field-specific velocity-space selection\nfunctions (already weighted by the number of galaxies in\neach field) into a single stacked function:\nN (v) =\n\n15\nX\n\nNj (v) .\n\n(6)\n\nj=1\n\nThe resulting selection function is fairly flat over the\nrange |\u03b4v| < 20000 km s\u22121 with a slight negative slope\n(yellow shading in Fig. 1), indicating our slight bias toward detecting objects \"in front\" of the HLQSO (that\nis, at lower redshifts) compared to galaxies slightly \"behind\" the HLQSO in each field. The selection function is\nthus a prediction for the observed distribution of galaxies\nin relative-velocity space in the absence of clustering.\n\n\f6\n\nTrainor & Steidel\n\n3.2. Bias in Field Selection\nWe previously knew one KBSS field (HS1549+1919)\nto have a large overdensity in the galaxy distribution\nvery close to the redshift of the central HLQSO. The\nvariation in overdensity among fields can be estimated by\nN1500 in Table 2, which is the number of galaxies within\n1500 km s\u22121 of the HLQSO redshift for that field. In\norder to ensure that our clustering results are not being\ndominated by a single field, we repeated our analysis on\nsubsamples of the data consisting of 14 of the 15 fields,\nremoving a different field each time. In each case the\nmagnitude and scale of the overdensity was consistent\nwith that observed when all 15 fields were included in\nthe analysis, indicating that the observed magnitude and\nscale of the overdensity are not determined by any single\nfield.\n\nFig. 3.- The relative overdensity f ovr (Eq. 7) as a function of\nvelocity relative to the central HLQSOs over a wide velocity range.\nThe overdensity is measured in bins of 500 km s\u22121 , as this Hubble\nflow velocity roughly corresponds to the same physical scale as our\ntransverse field of view (5h\u22121 cMpc \u223c 500 km s\u22121 ). See \u00a73.1 for\ndetails on the selection function.\n\n3.3. Redshift Clustering Results\nFig. 1 shows the observed galaxy distribution in units\nof velocity along with the selection function estimate\nfrom \u00a73.1. The peak in the galaxy distribution near the\nHLQSO redshifts is clearly visible. Fitting a Gaussian\nfunction to the histogram in Fig. 1 gives a velocity width\n\u03c3v,fit = 350\u00b150 km s\u22121 , which includes the effect our\n\u03c3v,err \u2243 125 km s\u22121 galaxy redshift errors and the random residual errors in our HLQSO redshifts, assumed to\nbe \u03c3v,err \u223c 270 km s\u22121 . After subtracting the redshift\nerrors in quadrature, we find an intrinsic velocity width\nof \u03c3v,pec \u2243 200 km s\u22121 for the galaxy overdensity, which\nwe attribute to peculiar velocities. Note that the residual HLQSO redshift errors are uncertain and likely to be\nlargely systematic (see \u00a72.1), so our estimated velocity\ndispersion is an upper limit on the true peculiar velocity\nscale if the random component of the HLQSO redshift\nerror is larger than we have assumed.\nWe also consider the relative overdensity at the\nHLQSO redshift by comparing the observed density to\nthat predicted by our selection function. The distribution is plotted as a relative overdensity\n\nfovr = (Nobs \u2212 Npred)/Npred\n\n(7)\n\nin Fig. 3, where N obs is the number of galaxies observed\nin a given velocity bin and N pred is the number predicted\nfor that bin by our selection function. The relative overdensity is measured in bins with \u2206v = 500 km s\u22121 ; this\nscale was chosen to correspond roughly to the transverse\nscale of our field, since a Hubble-flow velocity of 500 km\ns\u22121 \u223c 5h\u22121 cMpc at these redshifts. Fig. 3 shows that\nthe HLQSOs are associated (on average) with a \u03b4n/n \u223c 7\noverdensity of galaxies when considered on the \u223c5h\u22121\nMpc scale of our field, with no features of comparable\namplitude over a wide range of redshifts (40000 km s\u22121\ncorresponds to \u2206z \u2243 0.5 at z \u2243 2.7).\n\nFig. 4.- For each projected circular annulus, the relative overdensity (fovr ; Eq. 7) of galaxies within 1500 km s\u22121 of the HLQSO\nwith respect to the redshift selection function and angular selection\nfunction. The overdensity of galaxies is localized for the most part\nto a tranverse scale R . 0.5h\u22121 cMpc.\n\nRepeating this analysis after dividing the galaxies into\nradial annuli, we find that the redshift association is most\npronounced for those galaxies within 25\u2032\u2032 of the HLQSO\nline of sight (\u223c200 pkpc), though a lower level of redshift clustering does extend to larger projected distances\n(see Fig. 4). If this distance is taken as an isotropic\nspatial scale of the galaxy overdensity, then the line-ofsight velocity dispersion due to the Hubble flow would\nbe only \u223c65 km s-1 . However, a less-significant overdensity does extend to larger radii, and thus likely includes\nmany galaxies that are clustered around the HLQSO but\nmove with the Hubble flow. In order to ensure that the\nmeasured velocity width is not inflated by these nonvirialized galaxies, we directly measure the velocity dispersion among the 15 galaxies within 1500 km s\u22121 and\n0.5 h\u22121 cMpc (200 pkpc) of the HLQSOs; as discussed\nin \u00a75, these galaxies are likely to be virialized and associated with the HLQSO, and our selection functions\npredict only 1.5 galaxies in this volume in the absence\nof clustering. These 15 galaxy velocities have a sample\nstandard deviation of 335 km s\u22121 , consistent with the\nvelocity width measured for the entire overdensity. The\nobserved velocity spread is thus presumably set by peculiar velocities of \u03c3v,pec \u2243 200 km s-1 among the HLQSOassociated galaxies.\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\nA comparison of Figs. 3 & 4 demonstrates that the\nrelative overdensity is highly scale-dependent. If we assume that the width of the overdensity in velocity space\nis entirely due to peculiar velocities, and hence that all\n15 of the galaxies observed with R < 0.5h\u22121 cMpc and\n|\u03b4v| < 500 km s\u22121 are physically located within a threedimensional distance r < 0.5h\u22121 cMpc from their nearest\nHLQSO, then the number of galaxies in this composite\nvolume is \u223c50x the number predicted by our redshift and\nangular selection functions (described in \u00a73.1 & \u00a74.1.1,\nrespectively).\n\n7\n\nP (R)d\u03a9 = P0\u2032 d\u03a9 [1 + wp (R)] = d\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n4.1. Galaxy-HLQSO Cross-Correlation Function\n\nMuch of the recent work on QSO clustering relies on\nlarge-scale two-point correlation functions, particularly\nthe QSO autocorrelation function (see e.g. Shen et al.\n2007). The galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation function \u03beQ\ncan provide a complementary estimate of HLQSO host\nhalo mass.\nThe correlation function is defined as the excess conditional probability of finding a galaxy in a volume dV at\na distance r = |r1 \u2212 r2 |, given that there is a HLQSO at\npoint r1 , such that P (r2 |r1 )dV = P0 [1 + \u03be(r)]dV , where\nP0 dV is the probability of finding a galaxy at an average\nplace in the universe. Here we assume a power-law form\nfor the correlation function: \u03beGQ = (r/r0GQ )\u2212\u03b3 , where \u03b3\nis the slope parameter and r0 corresponds to the comoving distance at which the local number density of galaxies\nis twice that of an average place in the universe.\nMany recent analyses of the two-point correlation\nfunction have dispensed with power-law fits in favor of directly modeling the halo-occupation distribution (HOD; see e.g. Seljak 2000; Berlind & Weinberg\n2002; Zehavi et al. 2004) based on the theory of\nPress & Schechter (1974) and a statistical method of\npopulating dark matter (DM) halos with galaxies. A\ngeneral feature of these HOD models is a deviation from\na single power law at distances near 1h\u22121 cMpc due to a\ntransition from the single-halo regime (the clustering of\ngalaxies/QSOs within a single dark-matter halo) to the\ntwo halo regime (the clustering of galaxies/QSOs hosted\nby distinct halos).\nIn this paper we implement the simpler power-law\nfitting technique for the following reasons. First, our\nsmaller sample (with respect to the large surveys at low\nredshift) does not allow us to detect a deviation from a\npower-law fit with any significance, particularly for the\ngalaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation. Second, our choice to\nfix the power-law slope \u03b3 (see below) desensitizes our\nresult to the precise shape of the correlation function,\nleaving the clustering length r0GQ to primarily reflect the\nintegrated pair-probability excess over the range of projected distances in our sample.\nIn practice, the three-dimensional correlation function\n\u03be(r) is not directly measurable: line-of-sight velocities\nare an imperfect proxy for radial distance due to peculiar velocities and redshift errors. As such, it is more\nuseful to consider the reduced angular correlation function, wp (R|\u2206z) by integrating over a redshift or velocity\nwindow:\n\n(8)\n\nwhere R = DA (z)\u03b8(1 + z) is the projected comoving distance from the HLQSO, and DA (z) is the angular diameter distance to the HLQSO. In the limit \u2206z \u2192 \u221e, and\nassuming a power-law form of the three-dimensional correlation function, it can be shown that the reduced angular correlation function has an equally simple power-law\nform:\nwp (R) = AR\u2212\u03b7 .\n\n4. CORRELATION FUNCTION ESTIMATES\n\nP (r)dz\n\n\u2206z\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03b7 = \u03b3 \u2212 1. However, we would like to restrict\nour analysis to small redshift/velocity scales, choosing\na value of \u2206z that includes the entire clustering signal while eliminating the noise contribution of uncorrelated structure at large line-of-sight separations from the\nHLQSO, and this priority precludes the assumption of\n\u2206z \u2192 \u221e. In the case of a truncated redshift range, the\nreduced angular correlation function does not simplify to\na power-law, and instead takes the form of a Gaussian\nhypergeometric function, denoted as 2 F1 (a, b; c; z). In\nour particular case, the reduced angular cross-correlation\nfunction wpGQ is expressed by the following:\nwpGQ (R) =\n=\n\nZ\n\nz0\n\n(r/r0GQ )\u2212\u03b3 dz =\n\nR\n\nz0\n\n\u2212z0\n\n\u2212z0\n\nr0GQ\n\nZ\n\n!\u03b3\n\n2 F1\n\n\u0012\n\np\n( R2 + z 2 /r0GQ )\u2212\u03b3 dz\n\n1 \u03b3 3 \u2212z02\n, ; ;\n2 2 2 R2\n\n\u0013\n\n(10)\n\nwhere z0 is the half-width of the redshift window over\nwhich we compute the clustering strength. We choose\na value z0 = 1500 km s\u22121 \u2243 14h\u22121 cMpc in order\nto encompass the entire observed overdensity (see Fig.\n1) and the range of projected distances we are able\nto probe (R < 4.2h\u22121 cMpc) without including excess\nnoise. We then fit the reduced angular correlation function wpGQ (R|r0GQ , \u03b3) to the data by variation of the correlation length r0GQ . We fix \u03b3 = 1.5 for simplicity in\nmatching our data to halo populations (see \u00a74.3); this\nvalue of \u03b3 was chosen as it is a reasonably good fit to both\nthe galaxy autocorrelation function and galaxy-HLQSO\ncross-correlation function, as well as the correlation functions among the simulated halo populations. Increasing\nthe value of \u03b3 causes the best-fit value of r0GQ to decrease,\nbut the corresponding halo mass is very insensitive to the\nchoice of \u03b3, so long as the same value is used for both\nthe galaxy and the simulated halo populations.\nIn order to estimate wpGQ (R) from our data, we separate our fields into projected circular annuli of varying\nwidths, constructed so that each annulus has a roughly\nsimilar signal-to-noise ratio, and with our largest annulus having its outer edge \u223c200\u2032\u2032 from the HLQSO,\na projected distance of R = 4.2h\u22121 cMpc. As noted\nabove, we wish to restrict our analysis to those galaxies that are closely associated with a HLQSO in redshift as well as projected position, so we also separate\nour galaxy sample into two velocity groups: one with\n|\u03b4v| \u2264 1500 km s\u22121 and one with |\u03b4v| > 1500 km s\u22121 .\n\n\f8\n\nTrainor & Steidel\n\nIn this way, we define Nv (Rk ) as the number of velocityassociated galaxies in the kth annular bin and N0 (Rk ) as\nthe number of non-associated galaxies in the bin.2 The\nsolid angle covered by the kth annular bin is given by\n2\n2\nAk = \u03c0(Router,k\n\u2212 Rinner,k\n); thus we likewise define the\narea densities of galaxies \u03a3v,0 (Rk ) = Nv,0 (Rk )/Ak .\nWe then used the selection function constructed in\n\u00a73.1 to estimate the expected number of galaxies in\neach velocity group [ie. Nv = N (|\u03b4v| < 1500) and\nN0 = N (|\u03b4v| > 1500)], which we convert to expected\naverage area densities for each velocity group (\u03a3pred\nv,0 =\nNv,0 /Afield ). Finally, we divide the measured area densities by the average predicted value to define the relative overdensity of each annulus. If the overdensity\n\u03a3v (Rk )/\u03a3pred\nis purely due to the clustering signal, then\nv\nthe reduced angular cross-correlation function is given\nGQ\nby wpGQ = \u03a3GQ\nv,obs (Rk )/\u03a3v,pred \u2212 1; however, this assumption is invalid if the angular sampling of the field is not\nuniform, which we explore below.\n4.1.1. Angular Selection Function\n\nThe use of the redshift selection function in Npred ensures that large-scale variations and sampling biases in\nredshift are taken into account in our analysis. Selection biases can also occur in the plane of the sky; because our fields are centered on their HLQSOs, any bias\nthat varies with distance from the center of the field will\nmimic a change in the correlation function. To account\nfor this effect, we recall that galaxies with |\u03b4v| > 1500\nkm s\u22121 show no association with the HLQSO (see Fig.\n1), and therefore should be uniformly distributed on average. Therefore, if the function \u03a30 (R) is not a constant, it must describe a non-uniform angular selection\nfunction, which encapsulates variations in optical selection sensitivity (e.g. due to non-uniform extinction or\nfield coverage) as well as any biases in slit positions on\nour masks. We assume these biases are independent of\nredshift, and that they produce the same fractional excess of galaxy counts in all velocity bins. Therefore, the\nmeasured values of \u03a3v (R)/\u03a3pred\ncorrespond to the the\nv\ntrue reduced correlation function 1 + wp (R) multiplied\nby a transverse (angular) selection function, which we\nestimate by \u03a30 (Rk ).\n\u03a3v (Rk )\n\u03a3pred\nv\n\n=\n\n\u03a30 (R)\n\u03a3pred\n0\n\n[1 + wp (Rk )] .\n\n(11)\n\nWe found that the measured values of \u03a30 (Rk ) are wellmatched by a power-law in R, and therefore, rather than\nusing Eq. 11 directly to estimate wp (Rk ), we found bestfit parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 for the following model:\n\u03a30 (R)\n\u03a3pred\n0\n\n= \u03b1R\u03b2 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe best-fit parameters for this model are \u03b1 = 1.59,\n\u03b2 = \u22120.58 with R in h\u22121 cMpc; the fit selection function is displayed in Fig. 5. Combining Eqs. 10, 11, &\n12, we arrive at an explicit model for \u03a3v (R) in terms of\n2 In this paper, we will use the subscript or superscript v to\ndenote velocity-associated galaxies, and 0 to denote non-associated\ngalaxies.\n\nthe galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation length r0 and correlation slope \u03b3:\n\u03a3v (Rk )\n\u03a3pred\nv\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0010 r \u0011\u03b3\n1 \u03b3 3 \u2212z02\n0\n= \u03b1R\u03b2 1 +\n(13)\nF\n,\n;\n;\n2 1\nR\n2 2 2 R2\n\nwhere z0 = (1500 km s\u22121 )H0\u22121 (1 + z)\u22121 is the half-width\nof the redshift window in physical units, and again \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 are set by fitting \u03a30 (R) to \u03a30 (Rk ). We then adjust the\nfree parameter r0 corresponding to the cross-correlation\nfunction to fit the measured values of \u03a3v (Rk ).\nThe fit to \u03a3v was performed via a simple \u03c72 minimization using an error vector constructed assuming\nPoisson uncertainties in the galaxy counts. The binned\ndata cover a range of projected distances 0.22 \u2212 3.57h\u22121\ncMpc.\nOur empirical estimate for wp (R) obtained via the\nabove methods is displayed in Fig. 6. We find a best-fit\ncorrelation length r0 = (7.3 \u00b1 1.3)h\u22121 Mpc after fixing\n\u03b3 = 1.5, where the error is a 1\u03c3 uncertainty computed\nvia a bootstrap estimate. This procedure consisted of\nrepeating the entire analysis 100 times (computation of\nselection functions, counting of pairs, and \u03c72 -fitting of\nwp ) using a random bootstrap sample of 15 of the 15 independent fields selected with replacement. The quoted\nuncertainty is the standard deviation of parameter values\nderived from these 100 bootstrap samples. The results of\nthis procedure were consistent with the results of jackknifing estimates performed using 14 of the 15 fields (ie.\nan n \u2212 1 jackknife estimate) or using 8 of the 15 fields\n(ie. an approximately \u223c n/2 jackknife estimate). The\n\u03c72 value for the fit is 3.7 on 4 degrees of freedom.\nAs noted in \u00a71, Adelberger & Steidel (2005) performed\na cross-correlation measurement with a similar sample of\ncolor-selected galaxies to compare black hole and galaxy\nmasses over a large range of AGN luminosities (-20 &\nMAB (1350\u00c5) & -30) at a similar range of redshifts to our\ngalaxy sample (1.5 . z . 3.6). That study separated the\nAGN sample into two bins of black-hole mass, obtaining galaxy-AGN cross-correlation lengths r0 = 5.27+1.59\n\u22121.36\nh\u22121 cMpc for AGNs with 105.8 < MBH /M\u2299 < 108\n\u22121\nand r0 = 5.20+1.85\ncMpc for AGNs with 108 <\n\u22121.16 h\nMBH /M\u2299 < 1010.5 . These measurements are fairly consistent with our own measurement of r0 for the galaxyHLQSO cross-correlation, given the size of the uncertainties, and Adelberger & Steidel (2005) assume a correlation function slope of 1.6, rather than the slope of 1.5\nused in this study. As noted above, the best-fit value of\nr0 varies inversely with the chosen slope for the range\nof separations our measurements include, and this effect\nlikely accounts for the slight discrepancy between these\ntwo estimates.\n4.2. Comparison to Galaxy-Galaxy Clustering\n\nThe strength of the clustering signal corresponds to\nthe mass scale of the HLQSO-host halos, which we are\ninterested in comparing to the average halo mass scale of\nnon-active galaxies. As such, the relative strengths of the\ngalaxy-galaxy (GG) and galaxy-HLQSO (GQ) clustering\nreveal the relative mass scales of their respective host halos, and therefore illuminate any halo-mass requirements\nfor the formation of HLQSOs at z \u2243 2.7.\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\n\n9\n\nbetween redshift-associated galaxies (those within 1500\nkm s\u22121 and in the same field as the fiducial galaxy) and\nnon-associated galaxies (those outside the velocity range\nor in a different field). We then integrate over the redshift\nselection function (\u00a73.1) to find the expected number of\ngalaxies in each interval, from which we can define an\nangular correlation function for each interval (by analogy\nto Eq. 11):\n\u03a3GG\nv,obs (R)\n\u03a3GG\nv,pred\n\nFig. 5.- The ratio \u03a3obs /\u03a3pred for the galaxy-QSO clustering (GQ; top) and galaxy-galaxy clustering (GG; bottom). In\npred\neach panel, the red diamonds denote \u03a3obs\n, while the black\nv /\u03a3v\npred\ncrosses denote \u03a3obs\n/\u03a3\n.\nThe\nerror\nbars\nare\nfrom\nPoisson uncer0\n0\npred\n\ntainties. The dashed black line is the fit to \u03a3obs\nand defines\n0 /\u03a30\nthe angular selection function; the functional form is a power-law\nfor the GQ selection function (\u00a74.1.1) and linear for the GG case\n(\u00a74.2).\n\nOur estimate of the galaxy-galaxy correlation function\nis based on the same technique as our galaxy-HLQSO\nestimates but is modified by centering on each galaxy,\nrather than the HLQSO, in turn. In addition, we restrict\nour GG analysis to those galaxies at redshifts zgal > 2.25\nso that the GG autocorrelation function probes a similar\nredshift range to that of the GQ cross-correlation; the\nmed\n909 galaxies with z > 2.25 have a median redshift zgal\n=\nmed\n2.63, while the median HLQSO redshift is zQSO = 2.66.\nFor each galaxy in our sample, we consider the number\ndensity (per unit solid angle) of galaxies as a function of\nprojected distance from our fiducial galaxy, separating\n\n\u03a3GG\n0,obs (R) \u0002\n\u03a3GG\n0,pred\n\n\u0003\n1 + wpGG (R)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere again the v subscript denotes quantities corresponding to the redshift-associated sample, and the\n0 subscript denotes those corresponding to the nonassociated sample. The non-associated sample is not expected to cluster about the arbitrary line of sight defined\nby the position of our fiducial galaxy, so we interpret the\nquantity \u03a3obs,0 (R)/\u03a3pred,0(R) as an estimate of the relative completeness of our angular sampling. We found the\ncompleteness (ie. the angular selection function of the\ngalaxy-galaxy pairs) of our sample to be well-described\nby a linear model in R with negative slope: \u03a30 = aR + b.\nThis shape reflects the fact that we are able to measure the power on small scales for essentially all galaxies,\nwhile we can see the maximum separation \u2243 2Rmax only\nfor the small fraction of galaxies at the edge of our fields\n(and even then we see only the subset of pairs that lie\nentirely within the field). The best-fit parameter values\nfor the GG angular selection function are a = \u22120.160,\nb = 1.04 with R in h\u22121 cMpc (Fig. 5).\nAs in the case of the GQ cross-correlation function, we\nthen fit a model to \u03a3GG\nthat is a combination of the\nv\nunderlying clustering signal described by wpGG (R) and\nthe selection function described by \u03a3GG\n0 . The combined\nmodel is given by Eq. 15:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 GG \u0013\u03b3\n1 \u03b3 3 \u2212z02\nr0\n.\n= (aR+b) 1 +\n, ; ;\n2 F1\nR\n2 2 2 R2\n\u03a3pred\nv\n(15)\nFitting this model to the measured values of \u03a3GG\n(R\nk ),\nv\nwe find the best-fit galaxy autocorrelation length to be\nr0GG = (6.0\u00b10.5)h\u22121 Mpc, again fixing the slope \u03b3 = 1.5.\nIn this case, the errors in \u03a3GG\ncannot be considered Poisv\nsonian because each galaxy is counted in several pairs and\nthe galaxy counts are correlated between bins. However,\nthe 15 HLQSO fields each provide an independent es2\ntimate of \u03a3GG\nv , and the error used for the \u03c7 -fitting is\nbased on the scaled scatter among these values. The\nquoted error on r0GG is the 1\u03c3 uncertainty from the same\nbootstrap and jackknife procedures described for r0GQ\n(\u00a74.1.1). The \u03c72 value for the fit is 9.3 on 5 degrees\nof freedom.\nThis autocorrelation length is significantly larger\nthan that found by Adelberger et al. (2005b) [r0 =\n(4.0\u00b10.6)h\u22121 cMpc at z = 2.9], despite both studies\nrelying on a similarly-selected set of galaxies. However, this study is restricted to the spectroscopicallyobserved galaxies, which have a higher mean luminosity than the galaxies in the photometric sample used\nin Adelberger et al.

In addition, the much larger set\nof spectroscopic redshifts used in our sample allows us\nto characterize the redshift selection function with much\ngreater accuracy, as well as to restrict our analysis to\nthose galaxies associated with the HLQSOs in threedimensional space. For example, an injudicious choice of\nz0 in Eq. 10 would lower the estimated cross-correlation\nlength, either by failing to count HLQSO-associated\ngalaxies (z0 < 1500 km s\u22121 ) or by diluting the clustering signal by the inclusion of the voids adjacent to the\nHLQSO in redshift space (z0 > 1500 km s\u22121 ).\n\nTABLE 3\nClustering Properties of\nSimulated Halos\nMinimum\nM\nlog( M h )\n\nACF r0 a\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n\nXCF r0 b\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n\n11.50\n11.60\n11.70\n11.80\n11.90\n12.00\n12.10\n12.20\n12.30\n12.40\n12.50\n12.60\n12.70\n12.80\n\n5.1\n5.6\n6.1\n6.7\n7.1\n7.8\n8.6\n9.6\n10.5\n11.6\n12.8\n14.6\n16.3\n18.6\n\n5.6\n5.9\n6.1\n6.3\n6.8\n6.8\n7.2\n7.6\n7.8\n7.9\n8.4\n8.6\n9.0\n9.1\n\n\u2299\n\n4.3. Estimate of Halo Mass\n\nThe measured clustering of the galaxies in our sample\nis primarily useful in its connection to the mass scale of\nthe galaxy host halos. Because the clustering strength\nof dark matter halos is a function of halo mass, we can\ninvert this relation to obtain the halo mass for a population of objects with a given autocorrelation length. In\npractice, we perform this inversion numerically, finding\nthe population of simulated halos (for which the mass is\nknown) that match the clustering strength of our galaxy\nsample.\nUsing halo catalogs from the MultiDark MDR1 simulation (Prada et al. 2011; accessed via the MultiDark\nDatabase of Riebe et al. 2011), we measured the correlation length r0 as a function of minimum halo mass Mh using the Landy-Szalay estimator (Landy & Szalay 1993)\nand assuming the same power-law slope (\u03b3 = 1.5) used\nin our fit to the galaxy autocorrelation function. The\ncorrelation function was measured for halo populations\nof differing masses by varying the minimum Mh in steps\nof 0.05 dex; the correlation lengths for a subset of the\nhalo samples are listed in Table 3. A power-law correlation function is a poor fit to the halo clustering at small\nscales due to the effect of halo exclusion; therefore, we\nrestricted our fit to pairs with separations 1 \u2264 d/(h\u22121\nMpc) \u2264 5, a range that avoids the halo-exclusion zone\nwhile still closely matching the range of projected distances in our observed sample. In this manner, we find\nthat our galaxy sample is most consistent with having\na minimum halo mass log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7\u00b10.1, the fit to\nwhich is displayed in Fig. 6. The halos in this mass range\nhave a median mass log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 11.9\u00b10.1. The statistical error in the mass estimate is entirely due to the\npropagated error in the autocorrelation function, as the\nuncertainty in the autocorrelation function among simulated halos is negligible by comparison.\nIn addition to matching clustering strengths, we can\nalso attempt to match the abundances of observed galaxies and simulated halos. Although our spectroscopic\nsample of galaxies is incomplete, we can compare this\nhalo population to the galaxy luminosity function (GLF)\nof Reddy et al. (2008), which corrects for incompleteness in both the spectroscopic and photometric samples. Luminosity functions are measured separately for\ngalaxies with 1.9 \u2264 z < 2.7 and 2.7 \u2264 z < 3.4, while\nour sample straddles these two redshift intervals, but\nthe GLF evolves very little over this redshift range, and\nthe predictions of either model are quite similar. Using the Schechter (1976) GLF parameters listed in Table 7 of Reddy et al. (2008), and taking our magnitude\n\na\n\nHalo autocorrelation length (compare\nto r0GG = (6.0\u00b10.5)h\u22121 cMpc)\nb Cross-correlation length with halos\nof mass log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 (compare to\nGQ\n\nr0\n\n= (7.3\u00b11.3)h\u22121 cMpc)\n\nlimit R < 25.5 to correspond to MAB (1700\u00c5) . \u221219.9\nat z \u2243 2.7, the Reddy et al. models predict a galaxy\nnumber density \u03c6gal = 2.4 \u2212 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 (including the 1\u03c3 limits on \u03c6\u2217 ). The number density of\nlog(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 halos in the MultiDark MDR1 simulation is \u03c6sim = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 , entirely consistent\nwith the measured value of \u03c6gal .\nTaking the population of log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 halos to\nrepresent the host halos of the galaxies in our sample, we\nthen estimate the mass of the HLQSO hosts by finding\nthe population of simulated halos whose cross-correlation\nwith the representative galaxy halos is equal to our measured galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation function. Again\nvarying the minimum Mh (of fiducial HLQSO hosts) in\n0.05 dex increments, and using a Landy-Szalay variant\nfor a cross-correlation with \u03b3 = 1.5, we find that a\nHLQSO host halo mass log(Mh /M\u2299 )>12.1\u00b10.5 (a median halo mass of log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 12.3\u00b10.5) is most consistent with our galaxy-HLQSO cross-correlation measurement. The error in the mass is due to the error\non both r0GQ and the propagated error on the galaxy\nhost halo mass, since the strength of the cross-correlation\nfunction depends on the mass of both the HLQSO-host\nand galaxy-host halo populations. The fit to the corresponding simulated cross-correlation function is shown in\nFig. 6. The MultiDark halos of log(Mh /M\u2299 )>12.1\u00b10.5\nhave an autocorrelation length of 6\u221215 h\u22121 cMpc, which\nwe consider to be an estimate of the HLQSO autocorrelation length, and such halos have an abundance\n\u03c6sim = (0.17 \u2212 5.9) \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 at z\u223c2.5 in the simulation.\n4.4. Dependence on Simulation Cosmology\n\nThe MultiDark suite of simulations used cosmological parameters based on the WMAP 5-year\nresults,\n{\u03a9m ,\u03a9\u039b ,\u03c38 ,h}\n=\n{0.27,0.73,0.82,0.70},\nwhich are consistent with the most recent\nWMAP 7-year results from Larson et al. (2011):\n{0.276\u00b10.029,0.734\u00b10.029,0.801\u00b10.030,0.710\u00b10.025}.\nIn comparison, the older (and widely-utilized) Millen-\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\nnium simulation (Springel et al. 2005) used cosmological\nparameters based on the WMAP 1-year results,\n{\u03a9m ,\u03a9\u039b ,\u03c38 ,h} = {0.25,0.75,0.9,0.73}. We here consider\nhow such a variation in these cosmological parameters\naffects the halo-matching process employed in this study.\nThe parameters \u03a9m and \u03c38 both affect halo abundances, and thus affect the halo bias and the mapping\nfrom clustering strengths to halo masses. Zehavi et al.\n(2011) conduct an HOD analysis on a large sample of\ngalaxies and find that varying the matter density over the\nrange 0.25 \u2264 \u03a9m \u2264 0.3 produces only a \u223c2% variation in\ntheir clustering measurements, which is quite small compared to the statistical uncertainty in our measurements.\nHowever, the amplitude of the linear dark-matter fluctuations, \u03c38 , is tied to the clustering in a more pronounced and complicated manner. The clustering of\ngalaxies in linear theory is given by the galaxy bias and\nthe dark-matter clustering: \u03beGG (M ) = b2 (M )\u03beDM . Decreasing \u03c38 decreases the value of \u03beDM but also greatly\ndecreases the number density of high-mass halos, which\ncauses the bias at a given halo mass b(M ) to increase.\nFor high-mass halos, the overall effect is to increase the\nclustering strength at a given mass when \u03c38 is decreased,\nwhich suggests that mapping halo masses to clustering\nstrengths using the Millennium simulation would result\nin a shift toward larger halo masses. Repeating our halomatching analysis on Millennium halo catalogs, we find\nthat the best-matched halo population of galaxies has\na minimum halo mass log(Mh,Mill/M\u2299 )>12.0\u00b10.1 and a\nmedian mass log(Mh,Mill/M\u2299 )=12.2\u00b10.1 in that simulation. The discrepancy between the two simulations is\n\u223c3x the statistical uncertainty in the galaxy halo mass\nmeasurements, confirming that the clustering of these\nmassive halos is quite sensitive to the chosen cosmological parameters.\n4.5. Relative Abundances of Galaxy-Host and\n\nHLQSO-Host Halos\nThe mass scales of the host halos for galaxies and\nHLQSOs map to halo abundances, as described in \u00a74.3.\nA galaxy host halo abundance of \u03c6sim,11.7 = 4.4 \u00d7\n10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 (the MultiDark Simulation abundance of\nhalos with log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7) and a HLQSO host halo\nabundance of \u03c6sim,12.1 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 suggests\nthat halos massive enough to host a HLQSO are only\n\u223c4x less abundant than those massive enough to host\nthe average galaxy in our sample; the fact that far fewer\nthan one quarter of the galaxies in our sample host a\nHLQSO is a strong constraint on the duty cycle of these\nobjects. However, the precise value of the HLQSO duty\ncycle depends on the number density of HLQSOs, which\nin turn depends on the choice of QSO population.\nAll of our HLQSOs have luminosities at rest-frame\n1450\u00c5 of log(\u03bdL\u03bd /L\u2299 )\u223c14, or an absolute magnitude\nM(1450\u00c5) \u223c \u221230.3 This is brighter than the luminosity\nrange for which large-sample statistics are available in\nsurveys such as SDSS and SLAQ [see e.g. Croom et al.\n2009, whose Mg (z=2) is comparable to M(1450\u00c5)], but\n3 This criterion may not be satisfied for the gravitationally lensed\nobject Q0142-10, and it is possible that other QSOs in our sample\nare also lensed. However, we regard it as unlikely that significant\nlensing has remained undetected in these well-studied objects, so\nthe rest-frame luminosities quoted here are assumed to be accurate.\n\n11\n\nwe can obtain an estimate of the z \u223c 2.7 quasar luminosity function (QLF) by extrapolating the results of the\nhighest redshift bins of Croom et al. (2009) to slightly\nhigher redshifts and luminosities; in this way we roughly\nestimate the number density of M(1450\u00c5) & \u221230 QSOs\nto be \u03c6QSO \u223c 10\u22129.5 h3 Mpc\u22123 . Integrating this density over the total comoving volume between redshifts\n2 \u2264 z \u2264 3 predicts \u223c25 QSOs in this luminosity range\nover the entire sky, suggesting that a large fraction of the\ncomparably bright QSOs at these redshifts are already in\nour sample.\nGiven this number density, we can extract the duty\ncycle of HLQSOs from the ratio \u03c6QSO /\u03c6sim,12.1 \u2243\n10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127 , defining the duty cycle as the fraction\nof halos massive enough to host a hyperluminous QSO\n[log(L/L\u2299)&14] that actually do host such a QSO. This\nextreme rarity with respect to the number of potential\nhost halos indicates that the formation of the HLQSO\nmust rely on a correspondingly rare event occurring on\nscales much smaller than those probed by our analysis, perhaps related to an extremely atypical merger or\ngalaxy interaction scenario.\n4.6. Black Hole Mass vs. Halo Mass\nIt is interesting to compare the host halo masses of\nthe HLQSOs to the minimum black hole (BH) masses\nallowed by their luminosities under the assumption of\nEddington-limited accretion; we will refer to this minimum mass as MBH . The minimum BH masses for each\nHLQSO are listed in Table 2. We calculate the value of\nMBH directly from L1450 (the value of \u03bdL\u03bd at a rest-frame\nwavelength of 1450\u00c5):\n\nMBH =\n\n\u03c3T L1450\n= 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22125\n4\u03c0Gmp c\n\n\u0012\n\nL1450\nL\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\nM\u2299 .\n\n(16)\n\nWe use L1450 in place of the bolometric luminosity\nLbol in order to avoid the additional uncertainty in the\nbolometric correction. The true bolometric correction is\nlikely to be small: Nemmen & Brotherton (2010) use a\nthin accretion disc model to predict a correction factor\nLbol /L1450 \u223c 3, which is consistent with the empirical\ncorrection estimated by Netzer & Trakhtenbrot (2007)\nfor L5100 and scaled by the L5100 /L1450 relationship of\nNetzer et al. (2007). However, there is substantial scatter in these corrections, and it may be expected that\nLbol /L1450 approaches unity for QSOs selected by the\nmost extreme rest-UV luminosities, so L1450 is a useful\nestimate (and likely a lower limit) on Lbol .\nThe HLQSOs in our sample span a range of \u223c5x in\nMBH (with the possible exception of Q0142-10), and it\nis notable that the field (HS1549+1919) with the largest\nvalue of MBH is also associated with the largest redshift\noverdensity in the galaxy distribution (see column N1500\nin Table 2). However, there is no clear relation between\nN1500 and MBH among the other fields, and our galaxy\nsamples are not large enough to comment on the variation of MBH with halo mass.\nThe median value of MBH for our sample is\nlog(MBH /M\u2299 ) \u2243 9.7. This indicates that the HLQSO\nhost DM halos are only \u223c300-2000x more massive than\ntheir associated supermassive BHs, even assuming accretion at the Eddington limit. The relationship between\n\n\f12\n\nTrainor & Steidel\n\nBH mass and DM halo mass is uncertain even at z \u2243 0\n(compare e.g. Ferrarese 2002, Booth & Schaye 2010, and\nKormendy & Bender 2011), but these BHs lie well above\nthe predictions of the MBH -\u03c3 or MBH -vc relations for any\nreasonable mapping of the DM halo mass to the bulge\nvelocity dispersion \u03c3 or circular velocity vc , as demonstrated below.\nThree such mappings are considered in Ferrarese\n(2002), in which the halo virial velocity vvir is related to\nthe circular velocity by considering vc = vvir (a zerothorder approximation), vc = 1.8vvir (based on observational constraints on DM halo mass profiles by Seljak\n2002), or vc /vvir given by a function of halo mass extracted from the N-body simulations of Bullock et al.\n(2001). These three different assumptions predict BH\nmasses of log(MBH /M\u2299 ) = 7.0, 8.4, and 7.5, respectively\nfor a halo of mass log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 12.3, corresponding to\nMDM /MBH \u2243 2 \u00d7 105 , 8 \u00d7 103 , and 6 \u00d7 104 . In any of\nthese cases, the minimum BH masses for the HLQSOs\nin our sample are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than\nthe predictions of the low-redshift associations, implying\nthat the host halos must \"catch up\" with the BHs in\norder to fall on the established relations by z \u2243 0.\nThough estimates of BH masses at high redshift are\nhighly uncertain, as are the stellar masses of their host\ngalaxies, this result agrees qualitatively with several observational studies that find BH host galaxies at high\nredshift (1 . z . 4) of a given stellar mass have systematically higher BH masses than in the local universe\n(e.g. Peng et al. 2006; Decarli et al. 2010; Merloni et al.\n2010; Greene et al. 2010); Booth & Schaye (2010, 2011)\ndescribe an interpretation of this evolution in terms of\nthe compactness of DM halos, which are more tightly\nbound at high redshifts. These studies generally find a\nsmaller deviation from the z \u2243 0 relations than is present\nin our sample, but the extreme luminosities of the HLQSOs in our sample force us to probe the highest-mass\nend of the BH mass distribution, so our measurements\nare very sensitive to the scatter in the Mh \u2212MBH relation\nas well as evolution in the mean.\nIf we consider the possibility that the dynamical mass\ndiscussed in \u00a75 includes matter external to the HLQSO\nhost halo at z \u2243 2.7, which may merge into a single\nmore massive halo by z \u2243 0, we can calculate where such\na halo would fall in the Mh \u2212MBH relations of Ferrarese\n(2002). Taking a halo mass log(Mh /M\u2299 ) = 13, the above\nprescriptions predict BH masses of log(MBH /M\u2299 ) = 8.3,\n9.6 and 8.7, respectively, which lie much closer to the\nrange of BH masses seen in our sample. However, it\nseems clear that the extremely high BH masses indicate\nthat the HLQSOs are atypical (with respect to the general population of QSOs) at the smallest scales.\n5. GROUP-SIZED HLQSO ENVIRONMENTS\n\nIn addition to the properties of the HLQSO host halos\nthemselves, it is interesting to consider the type of larger\nenvironment these hyperluminous objects inhabit. The\nspatial scale of the galaxy overdensities occupied by the\nHLQSOs in our sample is \u223c0.5h\u22121 cMpc (Fig. 4; \u223c200\npkpc), and the peculiar velocity scale of the composite\noverdensity is \u03c3v,pec \u2243 200 km s\u22121 after accounting for\nour measurement errors (Fig. 1). The relatively compact\nnature of the overdensity suggests that it may represent\na virialized structure (discussed below), in which case\n\nthe inferred size and velocity scales can be combined to\nprovide a crude estimate of the mass scale of the overdensity. The virial mass estimator can be expressed in\nterms of the 3D velocity dispersion hv2 i, a characteristic\nradius R, the gravitational constant G, and a constant\n\u03b1 \u223c 1 that depends on the geometry of the system:\nMdyn = \u03b1Rhv2 i/G .\n\n(17)\n\nIf we approximate our group as a sphere of uniform\ndensity, we have \u03b1 = 5/3. We can also take hv2 i =\nhvx2 i+hvy2 i+hvz2 i = 3\u03c3v2 \u2243 3\u00d7(200 km s\u22121 )2 and R \u2243 200\npkpc from the scales above, from which we find that the\naverage HLQSO overdensity is associated with a total\nmass log(Mdyn /M\u2299 ) \u2243 13 \u2013 the approximate mass scale\nof a small galaxy group, and consistent with the HLQSO\nhost halo mass derived from the clustering analysis in\n\u00a74.3.\nBecause of the crude nature of this estimate, we considered several checks to determine whether these overdensities are indeed consistent with virialized groups.\nIf the galaxies around the HLQSOs are in virial equilibrium, their spatial extent should roughly match the\nvirial radius r200 of a log(Mh /M\u2299 ) \u2243 13 halo, where\nr200 = (3Mgrp /800\u03c0\u03c1crit)1/3 . In fact, the virial radius\nfor this mass scale is approximately r200 \u2243 200 pkpc\n\u2243 0.5h\u22121 cMpc \u2013 this close match to the observed overdensity scale suggests that the HLQSO-associated galaxy\noverdensities are indeed virialized.\nFinally, we can estimate the number of galaxies associated with each HLQSO. From our smoothed selection\nfunction (\u00a73.1), we find that the approximate number\ndensity of spectroscopically-observed galaxies at z \u223c 2.7\nis \u03c6spec = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 , while the number density of log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 halos in the MultiDark simulation is \u03c6sim = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 (which is also\nthe abundance of galaxies predicted by the GLF of\nReddy et al. 2008). Under the assumption that each\nof these log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 dark matter halos host a\ngalaxy of comparable luminosity to those in our sample (\u00a74.3), this implies that our spectroscopic sample is\n\u223c30% complete. We find a total of 15 galaxies in our\nsample that are within 1500 km s\u22121 and 0.5h\u22121 projected cMpc of a HLQSO; taking our completeness into\naccount, we expect that there are another \u223c 35 galaxies remaning unobserved in this volume. On average,\ntherefore, each of the 15 HLQSOs in our sample has \u223c3\nother log(Mh /M\u2299 ) \u2243 12 galaxies within 200 pkpc, again\nsuggesting a group-sized environment.\nNote that we use the term \"environment\" here to connote a region that may or may not correspond to the\nhost halo of the HLQSO. The mass we derive here is\nslightly larger than the average HLQSO host halo mass\nof log(Mh,QSO /M\u2299 ) = 12.3\u00b10.5 derived from our clustering analysis (\u00a74.3), and the galaxies associated with\nthe HLQSO overdensity extend to greater projected radii\nthan the \u223c130 pkpc virial radius of such a halo (Fig.\n4). The discrepancy in the mass estimate may be due\nto larger-than-assumed errors in the HLQSO redshifts,\nas noted in \u00a73.3; overestimation of the galaxy velocity\ndispersion would inflate the dynamical mass estimate of\nthe system. However, it may also be that the HLQSO\nhost and its galaxy neighbors are subhalos within a\nlarger structure corresponding to our measured dynami-\n\n\fHyperluminous QSO Environments\ncal mass.\nIn addition, we note that the velocity scale of 200\u2212300\nkm s\u22121 and the overdensity of galaxies in such an environment are extremely conducive to mergers and dissipative interactions among galaxies. We suggest that the\nresults of this study are thus strong evidence that the\nfueling of these HLQSOs is associated with merger activity, with the caveat that our sample of HLQSOs are\nextreme outliers in the QSO luminosity distribution, and\nthus may be formed and sustained by rather different\nmechanisms than the average QSO at these redshifts.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe have used a large sample of galaxy redshifts to investigate the environments of 15 hyperluminous QSOs\n(HLQSOs) in the redshift range 2.5 < z < 2.9. Our\ngalaxy sample includes 1558 spectroscopic redshifts between z = 1.5 \u2212 3.6 from the KBSS\u2013we use the galaxies\nfar from the HLQSOs to characterize our redshift selection function in much greater detail than is possible with\npurely photometric samples. Furthermore, all the redshifts in our sample are projected within \u223c3\u2032 of one of\nthe HLQSOs, which allows us to describe the HLQSO\nenvironments on sub-Mpc scales. The principal conclusions of this work are given here:\n1. The HLQSOs are associated with a \u03b4 \u223c 7 overdensity in redshift when considered on scales of\n\u223c5h\u22121 Mpc. The overdensity has a velocity scale\nof \u03c3v,pec \u2243 200 km s\u22121 after subracting the effect\nof redshift errors, and a projected scale of R \u223c 200\npkpc. When stacked at the redshifts of the HLQSOs, the combined galaxy distribution shows no\npeaks of similar significance, and stacking on random galaxy redshifts shows that the HLQSOs are\ncorrelated with much more significant small-scale\noverdensities than the average galaxy in our sample.\n2. Careful treatment of the HLQSO redshifts is essential in order to accurately determine which\ngalaxies are associated with the HLQSOs in threedimensional space. When available, we used a\ncombination of low-ionization broad lines, narrow\nemission lines, and the onset of the Ly-\u03b1 forest in\nthe HLQSO spectra themselves in conjunction with\nnarrow Ly-\u03b1 at small angular separations from the\nHLQSOs to obtain HLQSO redshifts offset by hundreds or thousands of km s\u22121 from their previously\npublished values. The velocity scale of the observed\noverdensity, which is smaller than the measured offset for any one of these HLQSOs, demonstrates\nboth the accuracy of our redshifts and the inadequacy of common techniques for estimating the\nredshifts of these hyperluminous objects.\n3. The best-fit autocorrelation function for the subset\nof galaxies in our sample with z > 2.25 (zmed \u2243\n2.63) has a correlation length r0GG = (6.0 \u00b1 0.5)h\u22121\ncMpc. Comparison to dark-matter halo catalogs\nfrom the MultiDark simulation suggests that the\ngalaxies in our sample have a minimum halo mass\nof log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7\u00b10.1 and a median halo mass\nof log(Mh,med/M\u2299 ) = 11.9\u00b10.1.\n\n13\n\n4. The best-fit galaxy-HLQSO correlation function for our sample has a correlation length\nr0GQ = (7.3 \u00b1 1.3)h\u22121 cMpc.\nBy measuring the clustering between dark matter halos of various masses and those halos having\nmasses log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7, we find that the crosscorrelation between log(Mh /M\u2299 )>11.7 halos and\nlog(Mh /M\u2299 )>12.1 halos most closely matches our\nobserved value of r0GQ . We therefore deduce\nthat each HLQSO in our sample inhabits a dark\nmatter halo with mass log(Mh /M\u2299 )>12.1\u00b10.5,\nwhich corresponds to a median halo mass of\nlog(Mh,med/M\u2299 ) = 12.3\u00b10.5. The number density\nof these halos exceeds the number density of HLQSOs by a factor \u223c106 \u2212 107 .\n5. The HLQSO luminosities imply minimum masses\nlog(MBH /M\u2299 ) & 9.7, suggesting a BH-DM mass ratio MDM /MBH . 300\u22122000 for a dark matter mass\nlog(MDM /msun) \u2243 12.3\u221213. Such a small ratio indicates that the HLQSOs are significantly overmassive with respect to the MBH \u2212Mh relation at z \u2243 0,\nand appear overmassive with respect to equivalent\nrelations at higher redshift (though black hole mass\nestimates are quite uncertain at high redshifts).\n6. The HLQSOs in our sample are associated\nwith group-sized environments with total mass\nlog(Mgrp /M\u2299 )\u223c13. This conclusion follows from\na dynamical mass estimate from the peculiar velocities and projected scale of the galaxy overdensity, and is consistent with the virial radius and\ngalaxy counts expected for such a group. The peculiar velocities and overdensities associated with\ngroups strongly indicates that these HLQSOs inhabit environments where mergers and dissipative\ninteractions are common.\nIn conclusion, the results of this paper demonstrate\nthat the host halos of HLQSOs are not rare, so the\nscarcity of these objects is likely due to an extremely\nimprobable small-scale phenomenon that produces HLQSOs. Such a phenomenon could be related to an atypical\ngalaxy interaction geometry or similar scenario: the overdense environment with small relative velocities would\nincrease the probability of such an event, but an unusual\nmerger configuration is likely required to generate such\nlarge black hole masses and QSO luminosities.\nWe thank our collaborators for their important contributions to the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey over the\ncourse of many years: M.
