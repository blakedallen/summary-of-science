Brinkmann4 ,\nMasataka Fukugita5 , and Jon Loveday6\nABSTRACT\nWe examine a sample of low redshift (10 < d < 150 h\u22121 Mpc) field galaxies including\ngalaxies with luminosities as low as Mr \u2212 5 log10 h \u223c \u221212.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 2 (SDSS). The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low\nluminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria.\nWe present the luminosity function as well as the broad-band properties of low luminosity galaxies\nin this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity\nfunction; there is an upturn in the slope for Mr \u2212 5 log10 h > \u221218. The resulting slope at low\nluminosities in this sample is \u03b12 \u223c \u22121.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of\ngalaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate\nthat the true low luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than \u03b12 \u223c \u22121.5. The results\nhere are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g-band, roughly consistent with the\nresults of the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are\npredominantly low surface brightness, exponential disks, the majority of which are red.\nSubject headings: galaxies: fundamental parameters - galaxies: statistics\n\n1.\n\nMotivation\n\nExtremely low luminosity galaxies in the field are not a well-studied population, because they are\ndifficult to find except in deep, wide-field surveys. On the other hand, one of the major problems facing\nmodels of galaxy formation is why cold dark matter models predict larger numbers of low mass galaxies\nthan observed, either in the field or in the halos of larger galaxies. Thus, understanding the properties of\nthe lowest luminosity galaxies (which are presumably also very low mass) might shed light on some of the\nmysteries surrounding the production of galaxies in low mass halos.\nMost of the observational work regarding low luminosity galaxies has concentrated on galaxies in clusters. The Virgo cluster photometric sample of low luminosity galaxies (Binggeli et al. 1985), for which the\n1 Based\n\non observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n\n2\n\nCenter for Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics, New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York,\nNY 10003\n3\n\nPrinceton University Observatory, Princeton, NJ 08544\n\n4\n\nApache Point Observatory, 2001 Apache Point Road, P.O.

The low luminosity slope of the luminosity function\nin the Virgo cluster appears to be \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.3. A number of other purely photometric studies have found\nsimilarly steep slopes, usually as steep as or steeper than \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.4 (de Propris et al. 1995; Trentham 1998;\nSecker et al. 1997), and possibly a variation of the low luminosity slope depending on the cluster (Driver et al.\n1998). However, it is worth noting that deriving luminosity functions from photometry alone requires background subtraction, an uncertain procedure which may bias one's estimates towards steep slopes (Valotto\net al. 2001).\nRecently, Deady et al. (2002) have studied the properties of spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies\nin the Fornax cluster. They report that most of the low luminosity galaxies in that cluster are dE galaxies\nthat lie on the optical color-magnitude and magnitude-surface brightness relationships for dwarf galaxies.\nNotably, they find a population of ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) which tend to be very red and (as their\nname suggests) small even for their luminosity.\nThe other location in which astronomers have studied very low luminosity galaxies is of course in the\nLocal Group (Mateo 1998). It is in this environment that we have the best constraints on the luminosity\nfunction at very low luminosities (van den Bergh 1992; Trentham et al. 2005). In the Local Group, \"late\ntype\" dwarfs (spirals or irregulars) tend to be blue, though a large fraction (\u223c 50%) of the known dwarfs\n(MV > \u221214) are \"early type\" (dwarf spheroidals and ellipticals) and have red colors typical of high luminosity\ngalaxies. In the past few years, there have been several new detections of low luminosity objects in the Local\nGroup (Ibata et al. 1995; Armandroff et al. 1998, 1999; Whiting et al. 1999; Zucker et al. 2004; Willman\net al. 2004).\nThere are a number of efforts to collect data on low luminosity galaxies in other areas. Impey et al.\n(1996) have searched for low luminosity galaxies nearby by selecting low surface brightness galaxies. More\nrecently, Karachentsev et al. (2004) released a catalog of nearby galaxies selected from the literature, from\neyeball inspection of photographic plates, from HI surveys, and from infrared surveys. Again, many of the\ngalaxies were found by selecting low surface brightness objects which were followed up in the optical or radio.\nThe resulting catalog contains galaxies as low luminosity as MB \u223c \u22128. Gil de Paz et al. (2003) have defined\na set of \"blue compact dwarf\" (BCD) galaxies, having culled these from a number of different catalogs with\nvarying selection criteria. A new very low luminosity galaxy (MI \u223c \u221210) has been recently discovered in the\nfield (Pasquali et al. 2005). There are also viable candidates (as yet unconfirmed) in small groups (Flint et al.\n2001). The HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS; Meyer et al. 2004) have a neutral-gas selected sample which\nincludes many objects with low optical luminosities and surface brightnesses (West et al. in preparation).\nPrevious large field galaxy redshift surveys have provided samples of low luminosity galaxies selected\nwithout regard to environment: for example, the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey (Huchra et al.\n1983), the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (Shectman et al. 1996), the IRAS Point Source Catalog redshift\nsurvey (Saunders et al. 2000), and the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al.\n2001). The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Abazajian et al. 2004) represents an improvement on these\nand other previous surveys. It has deep surface brightness limits in its photometry, covers a wide area of\nsky, and provides highly complete follow-up spectroscopy. On the other hand, its photometric and spectroscopic pipelines are not optimized for finding such low redshift objects, resulting in problems in creating a\nreliable low redshift catalog. In Blanton et al. (2004) we created such a catalog using extra processing and\ncareful inspection of galaxies in the SDSS catalog. The result is not perfect; in particular, there is clearly\nincompleteness at the luminous, nearby end and at low surface brightness. However, the selection process,\nwhich is homogeneous, fairly well-defined, and unbiased with respect to environment, yields a catalog whose\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nproperties we can compare to theoretical predictions.\nOur focus here is not on studying a necessarily complete census of nearby galaxies - impossible in any\ncase given the current sky coverage of the SDSS - but instead on describing the properties of a well-defined\nsample. For that reason, we have not included every object with a known (low) redshift in the catalog, but\nonly those whose selection criteria we understand - that is, those in the SDSS spectroscopic survey.\nOur sample is publicly distributed as part of the NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (Blanton et al.\n2004). As described below, that catalog includes all of the parameters used to make the figures in this paper,\nincluding atlas images.\nIn this paper we present the catalog and a basic description of their properties. Section 2 describes the\nSDSS, how we have selected our galaxies, and what properties we have measured. Section 3 investigates the\nsurface brightness completeness of our sample. Section 4 describes qualitatively the distribution in space\nof these galaxies, the distribution of their basic photometric properties relative to those of more luminous\ngalaxies, and their luminosity function. Section 5 summarizes our results.\nWhere necessary, we have assumed cosmological parameters \u03a90 = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and H0 = 100 h km\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (with h = 1). All magnitudes in this paper are K-corrected to rest-frame bandpasses using the\nmethod of Blanton et al. (2003), unless otherwise specified. Because of the small range of look-back times\nin our sample (a maximum of around 700 Myr), we do not evolution-correct any of our magnitudes.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\nSDSS\n\nThe SDSS is taking ugriz CCD imaging of 104 deg2 of the Northern Galactic sky, and, from that imaging,\nselecting 106 targets for spectroscopy, most of them galaxies with r < 17.77 mag (e.g., Gunn et al. 1998; York\net al. 2000; Abazajian et al. 2003). Automated software performs all of the data processing: astrometry (Pier\net al. 2003); source identification, deblending and photometry (Lupton et al. 2001); photometricity determination (Hogg et al. 2001); calibration (Fukugita et al. 1996; Smith et al. 2002); spectroscopic target selection\n(Eisenstein et al. 2001; Strauss et al. 2002; Richards et al. 2002); spectroscopic fiber placement (Blanton\net al. 2003a); and spectroscopic data reduction. Descriptions of these pipelines also exist in Stoughton et al.\n(2002). An automated pipeline called idlspec2d measures the redshifts and classifies the reduced spectra\n(Schlegel et al., in preparation).\nThe spectroscopy has small incompletenesses coming primarily from (1) galaxies missed because of\nmechanical spectrograph constraints (6 percent; Blanton et al. 2003a), which leads to a slight underrepresentation of high-density regions, and (2) spectra in which the redshift is either incorrect or impossible\nto determine (< 1 percent). In this context, we note that the mechanical constraints are due to the fact\nthat fibers cannot be placed more closely than 55\u2032\u2032 ; when two or more galaxies have a separation smaller\nthan this distance, one member is chosen independent of its magnitude or surface brightness. Thus, this\nincompleteness does not bias the sample with respect to luminosity. In addition, there are some galaxies\n(\u223c 1 percent) blotted out by bright Galactic stars, but this incompleteness should be uncorrelated with\ngalaxy properties.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\n2.2.\n\nNYU-VAGC\n\nFor the purposes of computing large-scale structure and galaxy property statistics, we have assembled a\nsubsample of SDSS galaxies known as the NYU Value Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC; Blanton et al.\n2004). One of the products of that catalog is a low redshift catalog. Here we use the version of that catalog\ncorresponding to the SDSS Data Release 2 (DR2; Abazajian et al. 2004). The reader can obtain this catalog\nat our web site1 ; the low redshift catalog is referred to on those pages as \"lowz.\"\nThe low redshift catalog has a number of important features which are useful in the study of low\nluminosity galaxies. Most importantly:\n1. We have checked by eye all of the images and spectra of low luminosity (Mr > \u221215) or low redshift\n(z < 0.01) galaxies in the NYU-VAGC. Most significantly, we have trimmed those which are \"flecks\"\nincorrectly deblended out of bright galaxies; for some of these cases, we have been able to replace\nthe photometric measurements with the measurements of the parents. For a full description of our\nchecks, see Blanton et al. (2004), in which we conclude that we are correctly treating the photometry\nfor > 90% of the galaxies for which we have spectroscopy.\n2. The deblending algorithm has improved over time; we targeted the spectroscopy using the original,\ninferior reductions, but have since rereduced the images with a new version of the software. For galaxies\nwhich were shredded in the target version of the deblending, the spectra are often many arcseconds\naway from the nominal centers of the galaxy in the latest version of the photometric reductions. We\nhave used the new version of the deblending to decide whether these (otherwise non-matched spectra)\nshould be associated with the galaxy in the best version.\n3. We have estimated the distance to low redshift objects by correcting for peculiar velocities using the\nWillick et al. (1997) model of the local velocity field based on the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey (Yahil\net al. 1991) density field (using \u03b2 = 0.5), and propagated the uncertainties in distance into uncertainties\nin absolute magnitude.\nOther general features of the NYU-VAGC low redshift catalog which we make use of here are:\n1. As part of NYU-VAGC, we fit the radial galaxy profile using a simple S\u00e9rsic measurement (S\u00e9rsic\n1968), accounting for seeing. The form of the S\u00e9rsic profile is:\ni\nh\n(1)\nI(r) = A exp \u2212(r/r0 )1/n .\nThe fitting procedure is fully described in Blanton et al. (2005).\n2. We estimate the maximum volume in which we could have observed each galaxy, accounting for the\nflux limits and completeness of the survey.\n3. We calculate K-corrected and Galactic extinction corrected (Schlegel et al. 1998) absolute magnitudes\nin the ugrizJHKs passbands. The JHKs passband measurements are taken from the Two-Micron All\nSky Survey Extended Source Catalog (2MASS XSC). All magnitudes in this paper are K-corrected to\nrest-frame bandpasses using the method of Blanton et al. (2003). We do not evolution-correct any of\nthe magnitudes because of the small range of redshifts in our sample.\n1 http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nAll surface brightnesses referred to in this paper are r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses\n\u03bc50,r , unless otherwise specified.\nWe select galaxies for the catalog in the range 10 < d < 150 h\u22121 Mpc. The total completeness-weighted\neffective area of the sample is 2220.9 square degrees. Thus, the volume of the sample is 7.6 \u00d7 105 h\u22123 Mpc3 .\nThe catalog contains 28,089 galaxies.\nFigures 1a and 1b show the SDSS gri images and 3\u2032\u2032 fiber spectra for the 20 lowest luminosity galaxies\nin our sample. The color images are prepared using the method of Lupton et al. (2004). They are sorted\nby color, reddest to bluest. These low luminosity galaxies tend to be blue, unconcentrated, have very little\nstructure, and no noticeable dust lanes. These properties are consistent with previous studies of faint galaxies\n(e.g., Marzke & da Costa 1997; Bromley et al. 1998; Madgwick et al. 2002). They are mostly emission-line\ngalaxies. Among these 20 galaxies, only the reddest two would be classified as dEs, according to their colors\nand spectra (one of these two is nucleated).\nAs noted in the introduction, the advantage of our catalog is its well-defined selection criteria. For\ncomparison, the more local catalog of Karachentsev et al. (2004) (limited roughly at 7 h\u22121 Mpc) includes a\nlarge number of objects less luminous than those we study here, most of them closer than 2.5 h\u22121 Mpc. In\naddition, their catalog covers the entire sky, allowing them to examine very local structures, while ours is\nrestricted to the SDSS area. Finally, because they include HI-discovered galaxies and due to their efforts at\nspectroscopic follow-up on low surface brightness objects, they include some galaxies of much lower surface\nbrightness than we include here. However, a disadvantage of their catalog is that it appears to have been\nselected using very heterogeneous criteria, making certain statistical studies difficult.\n\n3.\n\nSurface brightness completeness\n\nLow luminosity galaxies tend to be low surface brightness. For that reason, it is important to understand\nthe surface brightness incompleteness of our catalog. There are three aspects of this incompleteness. First,\nin Section 3.1, we determine the completeness of the most recent version of the SDSS photometric catalog\nby testing the software on simulated data. In Section 3.2, we test this completeness empirically. Second,\nin Section 3.3, we determine the completeness of the SDSS spectroscopic targeting with respect to the\nphotometric catalog. Third, in Section 3.4, we determine the redshift completeness of the SDSS spectroscopy\nfor targets which have been observed. Section 3.5, summarizes the effects of surface brightness on selection.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe photometric catalog\n\nWe have examined the surface brightness completeness of the SDSS photometric survey using a fake\ndata pipeline (also described in Blanton et al. 2005).\nFor the current project we create 2500 fake galaxies (each with one image in each of the five SDSS bands)\nwith exponential profiles, blue colors typical of low surface brightness galaxies, of varying axis ratios, and of\nvarying half-light surface brightnesses and magnitudes, in the ranges 18 < \u03bc50,r < 26 and 14 < mr < 17.5.\nThe faint limit here is close to but slightly brighter than the SDSS spectroscopic limit of 17.77; as this limit\nis almost 100 times brighter than the photometric detection limit, the 30% difference between 17.5 and 17.77\nis not important to our results. We distribute the fake stamps onto a random set of locations on the sky\ncovered by SDSS fields. For each observation of an object in an SDSS field in each band, we convert the fake\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nstamps to SDSS raw data units, convolve with the estimated seeing from the SDSS photometric pipeline, and\nadd Poisson noise using the estimates of the gain. We add the resulting image to the real SDSS raw data,\nincluding the tiny effects of nonlinearity in the response and the less tiny flat-field variation as a function of\ncolumn on the chip. We run the SDSS photometric pipeline photo (version v5 4 25, essentially that used in\nthe SDSS DR2 release) on the resulting set of images to extract and measure objects. This procedure thus\nincludes the effects of seeing, noise, and sky subtraction.\nUsing the resulting photometric catalog, we create a fake version of the value-added catalog of Blanton\net al. (2004), resolving multiple observations and imposing the selection criteria in exactly the same way as\nfor the full catalog, including star-galaxy separation and all of the other SDSS Main sample criteria used\nfor spectroscopic target selection (Strauss et al. 2002). These criteria include an explicit half-light surface\nbrightness limit at \u03bc50,r = 24.5. These steps ensure that the fake photometric sample is selected in the same\nmanner as the real one in the NYU-VAGC.\nFinally, we compare the resulting catalog to the input catalog in order to evaluate our completeness\nto surface brightness selection effects. We require that the output object have a center within 5\u2032\u2032 and a\nPetrosian magnitude within 0.5 mag of the input object (since usually such a large magnitude discrepancy\nindicates that a separate, nearby object has been targeted). We should note here that in the actual catalog\nwe have reinstated some objects by hand. We have not done so in the fake catalog, meaning that we slightly\nunderestimate our completeness.\nThe contours in Figure 2 show the completeness thus calculated as a function of input half-light surface\nbrightness and input total magnitude. The underlying greyscale image is the distribution of galaxies in the\nreal galaxy catalog. Several features are prominent. First, in the lower left, small, bright objects have a low\ncompleteness. This occurs because of the lower limit on size of \u03b850 > 2 arcsec imposed in the Main sample\nselection criteria for objects with mr < 15.5 in order to eliminate double stars (Strauss et al. 2002). Second,\nin the upper left, there is incompleteness in faint, high surface brightness objects. This incompleteness\nresults from the star-galaxy separator, which confuses such objects for stars in marginal seeing (such as\nin the SDSS fields we are testing here, for which the seeing is 1.5\u2032\u2032 or so). We find that in better seeing\nconditions, this corner of the plot is nearly complete. Neither of these features are of particular interest here\n(though it is worth noting that there is a class of compact galaxies that this incompleteness affects, among\nthem M32 and the UCDs of Deady et al. 2002). The greyscale shows that very few objects are observed in\nthese regimes; in addition, since low luminosity objects tend to be lower surface brightness than average,\nthese incompletenesses at high surface brightness are unimportant for the low luminosity galaxies.\nHowever, on the right side it is clear that there is significant incompleteness at low surface brightness (more or less independent of size). A very small fraction of all SDSS galaxies are affected by this\nincompleteness, since the galaxy distribution declines long before it becomes important. However, low luminosity galaxies are disproportionately affected by the incompleteness, because they tend to be low surface\nbrightness, and so for the purposes of this paper we must consider this effect.\nThe incompleteness at low surface brightness is due primarily to two effects. First, there is sometimes\ninappropriate shredding by the photometric deblender of low surface brightness galaxies, often related to the\npresence of nearby stars. This shredding tends to reduce the galaxy fluxes to well below the flux limits of the\nsurvey. Second, for many galaxies the flux is significantly reduced because the sky subtraction determination\n(a 100 by 100 arcsec median filter) subtracts a substantial fraction of the galaxy light (Strauss et al. 2002).\nAt low surface brightness the completeness is nearly independent of apparent magnitude in Figure 2.\nTherefore, we compress the information by averaging across apparent magnitude, weighting by the number\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nof objects at each magnitude. This procedure yields the dot-dashed curve in Figure 3, the photometric\ncatalog completeness fph (\u03bc50,r ) as a function of half-light surface brightness. Table 1 gives the values used\nto make this figures.\nWe emphasize that this examination reveals the limits of the SDSS software, not the SDSS data. The\nphotometric pipeline was not optimized for finding low-surface brightness objects, and there are many more\ndetectable objects in the data. For example, essentially every object in our simulations (down to \u03bc50,r = 26)\nyields a large contiguous region of 5\u03c3 detected pixels; the non-detections of the catalog are due to deblending\nand mis-estimates of the sky. This accords with the results of Cross et al. (2004), who find for the deeper\nMillenium Galaxy Catalog that \u223c 90% of their objects yielded SDSS detections even at \u03bcB \u223c 26. We\nfurther note that all the galaxies in the nearby catalog of Karachentsev et al. (2004) that fall within the\nSDSS area are of high signal-to-noise ratio in the raw data and flagged as pixels with signal, even if in\nthe catalog they are deblended into many shreds or otherwise excluded from the spectroscopic survey, as\nmany of these very nearby (< 10 Mpc) galaxies are. These facts motivate an effort to recover even lower\nsurface brightness objects from the data and to weed out the considerable background of data defects, such\nas internal reflections of bright stars. Such an effort has been begun by Kniazev et al. (2004).\n\n3.2.\n\nEmpirical test using Galactic extinction\n\nWe can test the surface brightness completeness of the photometric catalog in a different manner,\nfollowing Davies et al. (1993). The observed surface brightness distribution of galaxies is shifted faintward\nby Galactic extinction by an amount that depends on direction and is predicted by Schlegel et al. (1998).\nThe top panel of Figure 4 shows this trend for all galaxies with an extinction-corrected Petrosian magnitude\nmr < 18. We use three bins of Galactic extinction centered on the values shown. Each curve is the surface\ndensity of galaxies as a function of Petrosian half-light surface brightness for the given Galactic extinction,\nin units that are the same for each bin of extinction.\nThe distribution of intrinsic surface brightness should not depend on the amount of intervening Galactic\ndust. So if we correct the surface brightness of each galaxy in the sample for the estimated dust extinction,\nand correct the surface density using the completeness estimate above (according to the observed surface\nbrightness, of course), the curves should be independent of the extinction. Indeed, the bottom panel of\nFigure 4 shows these distributions, which lie on each other quite well.\nThese figures make clear two points. First, for the bulk of SDSS galaxies, surface brightness completeness issues are irrelevant. Second, we have reasonable estimates of our completeness at the lowest surface\nbrightness end, which we will use below to attempt to judge what constraints we can make on the low\nluminosity slope of the luminosity function.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe tiling catalog\n\nThe above tests evaluate the completeness of the catalog of SDSS objects using the most recent version\nof the photometric pipeline. However, as we found above, the completeness has as much to do with the\nphotometric software as it has to do with the data itself. Furthermore, the software has changed over the\ncourse of the survey. Of particular interest here, the deblender has improved substantially. Earlier versions\ntended to incorrectly shred large galaxies into multiple parts. When low surface brightness galaxies were\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nshredded they often had their flux reduced enough that no part of them was targeted. Although, as found\nabove, this problem persists in the later reductions, software improvements have greatly mitigated it. All\nof the spectroscopic targeting used here was performed on the v5 2 version of the photometric pipeline, or\nprevious. Thus, we need to evaluate what fraction of the objects detected in the v5 4 results actually were\ntargeted by the old version of the software.\nTo evaluate this completeness we ask what fraction of NYU-VAGC galaxies brighter than the spectroscopic flux limit in each region of sky (see Blanton et al. 2004) have matches in the \"tiling catalog,\" the list\nof targets actually selected for spectroscopy by the SDSS. We denote this fraction fti (\u03bc50,r ).\nThere is a subtlety we must account for when considering the completeness of the survey, which is\nthat the tiling completeness integrated over surface brightness is already included in the completeness as\na function of position. The completeness as a function of position fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4), given by the NYU-VAGC\nsample described in Blanton et al. (2004), is the fraction of galaxies brighter than the flux limit that are\nin the spectroscopic catalog, which is basically a subset of the tiling catalog. Thus, fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4) effectively\nincludes the tiling incompleteness integrated over all surface brightnesses. So in order to isolate just the\nsurface brightness dependence of the tiling completeness, we scale our result according to the total tiling\ncompleteness:\nfti (\u03bc50,r )\n(2)\nf \u0303ti = R\nd\u03bc50,r p(\u03bc50,r )fti (\u03bc50,r )\nwhere p(\u03bc50,r ) is the probability density distribution of surface brightness. In practice, the denominator is\naround 0.97. Naturally, then, f \u0303ti can exceed unity (slightly), which is compensated for on average by the\nfact that fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4) is less than unity.\n\nFigure 3 shows this completeness f \u0303ti (\u03bc50,r ) as a function of surface brightness as the dashed line, and\nTable 1 lists the values plotted.\n\n3.4.\n\nThe spectroscopic catalog\n\nWe determine the spectroscopic incompleteness as a function of surface brightness simply by looking at\nwhat fraction of Main sample targets whose spectra we attempted actually yielded reliable redshifts. Figure\n3 shows this fraction fsp (\u03bc50,r ) as a function of surface brightness; the bottom panel shows the number of\nobjects used in each bin.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe total surface brightness completeness function\n\nIn order to evaluate the total surface brightness completeness, we simply multiply together the three\ncomponents above. Thus, the total completeness as a function of position and surface brightness may be\nexpressed:\nf (\u03bc50,r , \u03b1, \u03b4) = f \u0303ti (\u03bc50,r )fsp (\u03bc50,r )fph (\u03bc50,r )fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4)\n(3)\nFigure 3 shows this function (for a direction in which fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4) = 1) as the solid line.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\n4.\n\nLuminosity function and properties of galaxies\n4.1.\n\nCalculating the luminosity function\n\nBecause low luminosity galaxies tend to be low surface brightness, the surface brightness selection effects\ninvestigated in the previous section are likely to cause an underestimate of the luminosity function at low\nluminosities. Below, we will present three versions of the luminosity function:\n1. the raw luminosity function for galaxies with surface brightnesses \u03bc50,r < 24, completely uncorrected\nfor surface brightness selection effects;\n2. the luminosity function for galaxies with surface brightnesses \u03bc50,r < 24, corrected for surface brightness\nincompleteness; and\n3. an estimate of the total luminosity function using a model for the luminosity-surface brightness relationship.\nThe first two we calculate in all five bands; the last we only perform in the r band.\nWe calculate the uncorrected luminosity function (1) for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 using the step-wise\nmaximum likelihood method (Efstathiou et al. 1988). An advantage of this method, compared to the Vmax\nmethod (Schmidt 1968) or the method of Blanton et al. (2003c), is that those methods are susceptible to\ncosmic variance errors due to large-scale structure in the volume probed. That is, overdensities or voids can\nlead to artificial structure in the resulting luminosity function (or, in the case of the method of Blanton et al.\n2003c, artificial number density evolution). Basically, the idea of Efstathiou et al. (1988) is to maximize the\nconditional likelihood of observing each galaxy to have its luminosity given its redshift. The exact method\nused here is described in more detail by Blanton et al. (2001).\nTo calculate the luminosity function (2) for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24, we use these same techniques but\ninclude only galaxies in that range of surface brightness and, in addition, weight each galaxy with 1/f (\u03bc50,r ),\nthe inverse of the completeness found in the previous section. In practice, this means taking the individual\nlikelihood for each galaxy to the power 1/f (\u03bc50,r ).\nFinally, to estimate the numbers of galaxies missing below \u03bc50,r = 24 and thus the \"total\" luminosity\nfunction (3), we need to assume some model for the relationship between surface brightness and luminosity.\nTo do so, we select galaxies with n < 2 and Mr < \u221218. For such galaxies, the surface brightness limits are\nunimportant, as we will see below. We fit the following model to their conditional distribution in surface\nbrightness as a function of magnitude:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nexp (\u03bc50,r \u2212 \u03bc\u030450,r (Mr ))2 /2\u03c3\u03bc2 (Mr )\nP (\u03bc50,r |Mr ) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc\u030450,r (Mr ) =\n\u03c3\u03bc (Mr ) =\n\n\u03bc50,\u2217 + \u03b3(Mr + 20.5)\n\u03c3\u03bc\u2217 + \u03b2(Mr + 20.5)\n\n(5)\n\nThe distribution is thus a Gaussian in surface brightness at all absolute magnitudes, with a power law\nrelationship between absolute magnitude and the mean (linearly expressed) surface brightness. We allow the\nwidth of the distribution to grow linearly as the absolute magnitude increases. Note that we do not specify\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nthe normalization at each absolute magnitude. In this definition, \u03bc50,\u2217 is the typical surface brightness of an\nexponential galaxy around M\u2217 \u223c \u221220.5. Our best fit is \u03b3 = 0.45, \u03bc50,\u2217 = 20.56, \u03b2 = 0.081, and \u03c3\u03bc\u2217 = 0.58.\nFigure 5 shows the surface brightness distribution in bins of absolute magnitude. The histogram is the\nobserved distribution. The dotted line is the model of Equation 4. The solid line is the model multiplied by\nthe photometric and spectroscopic completenesses from Table 1. The lines are normalized to minimize the\nresiduals between the solid line and the solid histogram. The error bars on the solid lines assume Poisson\nstatistics.\nThe model is good in the range over which we have fit (Mr < \u221218). As stated above, it is clear that\nin this regime galaxies lie safely away from the surface brightness limits of the survey. Less luminous than\nthat (Mr > \u221218), for which the model represents an extrapolation, there are some deviations. In particular,\nthe observed distribution appears to have a slightly larger tail on the high surface brightness end than the\nmodel assumes.\nWe use this model to estimate the possible magnitude of surface brightness selection effects as c, the\nratio of two integrals: that of the solid line to that of the dotted line. That is, our estimate is the fraction\nof galaxies in our model which would be observable given our estimated completeness. Figure 6 shows the\nresulting \"correction\" factor one should therefore apply as a function of absolute magnitude.\nBy weighting by c, we obtain the \"total\" luminosity function (3). This estimate is obviously highly\nuncertain, since the model of Equation 4 does not necessarily represent the surface brightness distribution\nbelow our detection limits. However, it is our best guess at what could reasonably be missing.\n\n4.2.\n\nThe luminosity function and the luminosity density\n\nFigure 7 shows the luminosity function of our sample calculated using the step-wise maximum likelihood\nestimator. The black histogram shows (1), the luminosity function for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 uncorrected\nfor surface brightness incompleteness and represents a \"minimum\" abundance of galaxies. The dark grey\nrepresents (2), the luminosity function of galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 corrected for incompleteness. The light\ngrey histogram represents (3), the \"total\" luminosity function using the method of Section 4.1 to \"correct\"\nfor missing galaxies below the surface brightness limits. Note that this third estimate, while it represents a\nreasonable extrapolation of the abundance of galaxies at these luminosities, is not an actual measurement\nof it. We claim that an abundance of low luminosity galaxies similar to the light grey histogram cannot be\nruled out from any current data. Table 2 gives the values used for the histograms in Figure 7.\nThe smooth lines in Figure 7 represent fits to the luminosity function using a double Schechter function:\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b12 \u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b11\n\u0014\nL\nL\ndL\n+ \u03c6\u2217,2\n(6)\nexp(\u2212L/L\u2217) \u03c6\u2217,1\n\u03a6(L)dL =\nL\u2217\nL\u2217\nL\u2217\nStated in terms of absolute magnitude M = \u22122.5 log10 (L)+ const this equation is:\n\u0010\n\u0011h\ni\n\u03a6(M ) = 0.4 ln 10dM exp \u221210\u22120.4(M\u2212M\u2217 ) \u03c6\u2217,1 10\u22120.4(M\u2212M\u2217 )(\u03b11 +1) + \u03c6\u2217,2 10\u22120.4(M\u2212M\u2217 )(\u03b12 +1)\n\n(7)\n\nThis function is a much better fit than a single Schechter function, which fails to capture the upturn in\nthe luminosity function at Mr \u223c \u221218 or so. Although the luminosity function is nearly flat at luminosities\nhigher than that (and less than L\u2217 ), even the uncorrected, \"minimal\" luminosity function turns up to a slope\nof about \u03b12 \u223c \u22121.3 below that luminosity. As shown in the fit to the solid histogram, surface brightness\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nselection effects may imply a much steeper slope, possibly steeper than \u03b12 \u223c \u22121.5. The full set of parameters\nfound in these fits are listed in Table 5 (listed in terms of M\u2217 ).\nThe top panel of Figure 8 shows the cumulative number density distribution of galaxies brighter than\nMr as a function of Mr , for all three versions of the luminosity function. The bottom panel of Figure 8\nsimilarly shows the luminosity density, in units of absolute magnitudes per h\u22121 Mpc3 . The total luminosity\ndensity in these units is \u221216.02 for the uncorrected case (1), and \u221216.12 for the \"total\" case (3). Note that,\neven for the \"total\" case, most of the luminosity density (> 90%) is contained in galaxies with Mr < \u221217.\nThat is, as noted by a number of authors in the past (McGaugh 1996; Sprayberry et al. 1997; Blanton et al.\n2001; Cross et al. 2001; Blanton et al. 2003b) the contribution of low luminosity and low surface brightness\ngalaxies to the overall optical luminosity density appears small.\nFigure 9 shows the distance distribution of galaxies based on our best-fit distances. The smooth line is\nthe expected distribution given the raw luminosity function (1). Note there is change by a factor of \u223c 2 in\nthe mean density of galaxies in the local volume covered by this sample, which appears to be an underdensity\nin the nearby section of the volume covered by this sample. The fluctuation is within a volume of about 2\n\u00d7 104 h\u22123 Mpc3 , equivalent to about a \u223c 20 h\u22121 Mpc radius sphere. Given the results of Tegmark et al.\n(2004), whose constraints come from galaxy clustering over much larger volumes, we expect \u03c320 \u223c 0.5. Thus,\nthe structure we observe is consistent with what we know about clustering of galaxies on large scales using\nmore distant samples (which is itself consistent with predictions based on cosmic microwave background and\nother observations).\nFigure 10 shows the joint distribution of redshift and absolute magnitude in the top panel, and of\nenclosed volume and absolute magnitude in the bottom panel. Note there is a decrease in the density of\ngalaxies at small volumes, corresponding to the change in the overdensity of galaxies seen in Figure 9. For\nthe most luminous galaxies, there is something of a decline towards small volumes, probably indicative of\na bias against large objects due to the SDSS selection process. This bias comes from the fact that large\ngalaxies are often deblended incorrectly by the SDSS photometric pipeline, because they often have complex\nstructure and because they often run into the edges of fields. For future versions of this catalog, we will\nconcentrate on a more complete sample at the bright end to resolve these problems; however, the focus of\nthis paper is on the low luminosity galaxies, so we ignore this potential problem for the moment.\nIn addition, we calculate the luminosity function in the ugiz bands using the step-wise maximum\nlikelihood method and compare our result to those of Blanton et al. (2003c). In order to calculate each\nluminosity function, we restrict our sample to galaxies for which mu < 18.4, mg < 17.7, mi < 17.5, or\nmz < 16.9, depending on which band we are interested in. At each magnitude limit we are highly complete\nin the given band (Blanton et al. 2001). We follow the same procedure as we did in calculating the rband luminosity function. Figure 11 shows the results of this procedure for the raw luminosity function for\ngalaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 (1) as the black histograms. The version for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 corrected for\nincompleteness (2) appears as the grey histograms. The smooth lines are the double Schechter function fits\nwe describe above fit to each of the corrected luminosity functions. Tables 3 and 4 tabulate the results for\nthe uncorrected and the corrected case, respectively. Table 5 lists the double Schechter function parameters\nfor each luminosity function. Note that Baldry et al. (2005) suspect large sky subtraction errors to add\nconsiderable scatter to the u-band magnitudes of spectroscopic galaxies; our luminosity function here does\nnot use the empirical corrections they recommend.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n4.3.\n\nComparison to the Vmax method\n\nFigure 12 shows a comparison of our original (uncorrected) luminosity function using the step-wise\nmaximum likelihood method and that obtained using the 1/Vmax method. The 1/Vmax method is more\nsusceptible to the effects of large-scale structure (dotted histogram). These two estimates are in good\nagreement at the bright end (where they probe a large amount of volume), though some of the features\nin the Vmax result appear to be due to large-scale structure. In particular, the overdensity closer than 20\nh\u22121 Mpc and the underdensity in the range 30\u201350 h\u22121 Mpc in Figure 9 appear to result in a corresponding\noverestimate of the luminosity function at about Mr \u2212 5 log10 h \u223c \u221214 and an underestimate at about\nMr \u22125 log10 h \u223c \u221216. We show these results to give a sense of the possible errors in the distributions of galaxy\nproperties weighted by 1/Vmax shown in Section 4.6. These errors are significant but not overwhelming. The\nVmax results are listed in Table 2.\n\n4.4.\n\nComparison to the literature\n\nThere exist previous SDSS results using the full sample of galaxies out to a redshift z = 0.22 (Blanton\net al. 2003c). Those results are quoted in the 0.1ugriz bands, which are the ugriz bands shifted blueward\nby a factor 1.1 (Blanton et al. 2003), and are evolution correction to an effective redshift of z = 0.1. We can\ncalculate the photometric transformations from 0.1ugriz to ugriz based on the SED models fit by kcorrect\nv3 2, for galaxies of median intrinsic 0.1(g \u2212 r) color. This procedure yields the relationships:\nu\ng\nr\ni\nz\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0.1\n\nu \u2212 0.38\ng \u2212 0.41\n0.1\nr \u2212 0.22\n0.1\ni \u2212 0.19\n0.1\nz \u2212 0.11\n\n0.1\n\n(8)\n\nWe correct for evolution using the luminosity evolution model of Blanton et al. (2003c):\nM (z) = M (z = 0.1) \u2212 (z \u2212 0.1)Q\nn\u0304(z) = n\u0304(z = 0.1)100.4(z\u22120.1)P\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Q = 4.22, 2.04, 1.62, 1.61, 0.76 and P = 0.20, 0.32, 0.18, 0.58, 2.28 in the ugriz bands.\nFigure 14 shows the raw luminosity function (1) in the r-band for our sample compared to the results\nof Blanton et al. (2003c), shown as the solid line. Figure 11 shows the comparison for the ugiz bands. The\nagreement between the determinations is good in the range measured by Blanton et al. (2003c).\nIt is worth noting that both the current results and those of Blanton et al. (2003c) differ markedly from\nthose of Blanton et al. (2001), whose results are incorrect because they ignored the effects of evolution on\nthe normalization and slope of the luminosity function. These effects are fully described in Blanton et al.\n(2003c), which describes exactly why the Blanton et al. (2001) is in error. Essentially, the volume-weighted\nnormalization allowed the tiny number density of high luminosity objects to carry large statistical weight.\nSince the luminosity function is so steep at high luminosity, a small evolution in absolute magnitude resulted\nin a large change in number density at fixed absolute magnitude. For this paper, we have been able to ignore\nthe effects of evolution because we are considering such a small redshift range. For example, the Q = 1.62\nevolution in the r-band found by Blanton et al. (2003c) leads to a magnitude difference across this sample\nof only about 0.08. In addition, this sample is volume-limited for Mr < \u221218.5, so the steepness of the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nluminosity function at the luminous end is not as important as it was in the more distant sample of Blanton\net al. (2001).\nBaldry et al. (2005) have measured the luminosity function in the u band using a deeper (but more\nheterogeneously selected) SDSS sample and accounting for systematic errors in u-band sky subtraction which\nwe ignore here. Figure 13 compares our result with their results in the redshift range 0.02 < z < 0.04. The\nresults are similar, though at the low luminosity end there is about a 20% discrepancy in the density found\nin our sample and in their sample. The Baldry et al. (2005) sample is restricted to the 275 square degrees\ncovered by the SDSS Southern Survey, which raises the possibility that the difference is simply cosmic\nvariance.\nIn addition, Figure 16 compares the g band luminosity function to that of Norberg et al. (2002). We\nconvert the result of Norberg et al. (2002) in the bj band to g using the relationship g = bj \u2212 0.25. The\ndashed line in Figure 16 shows the result of converting their luminosity function this way. There are\nsignificant differences between our g-band luminosity function and that of Norberg et al. (2002). However,\nthe slope at low luminosities is very similar. Furthermore, we note that the luminosity evolution assumed\nby Norberg et al. (2002) is close to Q = 1.0, much less than the empirical luminosity evolution in the g-band\nQ = 2.04 found by Blanton et al. (2003c) and less than the theoretical estimate Q = 1.60 of Bell et al.\n(2003). An extremely simplistic way of accounting for this difference at high luminosities is to simply shift\ntheir absolute magnitudes by \u2206Qzm , where zm = 0.16 is their median redshift for galaxies with Mg < \u221219.7\nand \u2206Q = 1.04 is the difference between the effective evolution assumptions of Norberg et al. (2002) and the\nempirical estimates of Blanton et al. (2004). This shift brings the results more closely in line with each other\nat the luminous end, though fainter than that there are still 20\u201330% differences in the luminosity functions.\nA real comparison may require a more careful understanding of the different treatment of K-corrections\nand evolution in Norberg et al. (2002) and Blanton et al. (2003c). K-corrections at z = 0.25, the limit of\nthe sample of Norberg et al. (2002), are significant; they can be up to 0.9 mag in the g band. For the SDSS\nbands, Blanton et al. (2003) have shown that the K-corrections recover fairly consistent intrinsic colors of\ngalaxies as a function of redshift, but this has not been shown with respect to the bj band, and inconsistencies\nat the 10\u201320% level have not been ruled out. The effects of evolution are smaller, but much more poorly\nknown; theoretical estimates of the evolution do not agree with one another, and the empirical measurement\nof Blanton et al. (2003c) is by no means definitive.\nThe SDSS and the 2dFGRS are the most complete and well-studied redshift surveys of the local universe,\nand aside from the roughly 0.15 mag disagreement in M\u2217 they are in fairly good agreement on the overall\nshape of the luminosity function. There are no important discrepancies in the low luminosity slope.\n\n4.5.\n\nComparison between environments\n\nWe can compare these field luminosity functions to those determined in the SDSS from studies of clusters\nand voids. We leave for a future paper the task of comparing the luminosity function in different regions of\nour own sample, and here will concentrate on comparison to the literature.\nPopesso et al. (2004) have used statistical background subtraction on the photometric catalog to measure\nthe optical luminosity function around X-ray clusters without recourse to determining redshifts. Similar\nmethods have been used on other cluster samples by a number of authors, such as Schechter (1976); Gaidos\n(1997); Valotto et al. (1997); Garilli et al. (1999); Paolillo et al. (2001); Andreon & Cuillandre (2002); Goto\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\net al. (2002). We will not attempt here a comparison among all of those efforts. Figure 17 shows the best-fit\ndouble Schechter function result of Popesso et al. (2004) compared to our raw luminosity function (1). The\nexponential cut-off is clearly much brighter in clusters. In addition, the low luminosity slope is much steeper\nbelow Mr \u223c \u221217. Note that the results of Popesso et al. (2004) should be free of the background subtraction\nbiases in cluster luminosity functions described by Valotto et al. (2001), since the clusters are selected from\nX-ray observations rather than the galaxy counts themselves.\nBoth of the luminosity functions in Figure 17 are susceptible to surface brightness selection effects.\nHowever, it is possible that these effects are less important in the Popesso et al. (2004) results, since they do\nnot apply the target selection limit of \u03bc50,r < 24.5 that affects the spectroscopic results.\nFigure 17 also shows the luminosity function of SDSS void galaxies found by Hoyle et al. (2005). Their\nluminosity function is affected by exactly the same surface brightness limits as this paper is. For these\ngalaxies, there is a significantly less luminous exponential cut-off, but the low luminosity slope is remarkably\nsimilar to that of the field galaxy population.\n\n4.6.\n\nLuminosity function as a function of galaxy properties\n\nThe luminosity function is known to be a function of galaxy type - among the many papers on this\nsubject are those of Binggeli et al. (1988); Roberts & Haynes (1994); Marzke et al. (1994); Marzke & da\nCosta (1997); Bromley et al. (1998); Madgwick et al. (2002); Blanton et al. (2003b). In this section, we\nexplore this dependence using the sample at hand.\nFigure 18 shows the number density distribution of galaxy properties (determined, in this case, using the\n1/Vmax estimator for convenience). We have not corrected these plots for surface brightness incompleteness\nin any way. The diagonal plots show the number density distribution of absolute magnitude Mr , color g \u2212 r,\nr-band half-light surface brightness \u03bc50,r , and S\u00e9rsic index n. The off-diagonal plots show the bivariate\nnumber distribution between each pair of properties as contours and a greyscale. Many of the qualitative\nfeatures in this plot are extensions of the relationships found in Blanton et al. (2003b) for more luminous\ngalaxies (Mr < \u221217). Low luminosity galaxies are bluer, lower surface brightness, and more exponential\nthan high luminosity galaxies. Note that at low luminosity (say Mr > \u221216 or so) the surface brightness\nselection at around \u03bc50,r \u223c 24 clearly becomes important.\nIn the left column, one can see the luminosity function as a function of color, surface brightness and\nS\u00e9rsic index. The principal trend which is evident is the large density of red, low luminosity galaxies. We\nhave seen above that these red, low luminosity galaxies are preferentially in dense regions.\nIn order to investigate the properties of these red galaxies somewhat further, we split the sample along\ncolor using the following, luminosity-dependent cut:\n(g \u2212 r)c = 0.65 \u2212 0.03(Mr + 20)\n\n(10)\n\nThis dividing line, shown as the tilted line in the appropriate panel of Figure 18, is approximately at the\nbottom edge of the red sequence. Figure 19 shows the galaxies defined as blue by this cut. Even at high\nluminosity, these tend to be low surface brightness and not particularly concentrated. Figure 20 shows\nthe galaxies defined as red. The strong dependence of S\u00e9rsic index and surface brightness on luminosity is\nevident for the red galaxies. The lowest luminosity ones are as unconcentrated and low surface brightness\nas the correspondingly luminous blue galaxies, and generally are featureless and similar morphologically to\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\ndE galaxies. In addition, one can easily see that they have comparable space densities to more luminous red\ngalaxies.\nIn order to better see the luminosity functions of galaxies of various types, Figure 21 shows the raw\nluminosity function (1) for galaxies split into two categories, in three different ways: by color, as in Equation\n10; by S\u00e9rsic index, dividing the population at n = 2.5; and by surface brightness, dividing the population\nat \u03bc50,r = 21. We show the locations of these cuts as lines in Figure 18. As in the previous plots, here we\nsee that a large fraction of low luminosity galaxies are blue, low concentration, and low surface brightness.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented a sample and basic properties of a set of low redshift (z < 0.05) galaxies in the\nSDSS. Most interestingly, this sample is the only sample of galaxies extending down to Mr \u223c \u221212.5 which\nis unbiased with respect to environment.\nFrom our measurements of the properties of these galaxies and of their luminosity function, we conclude:\n1. The slope of the luminosity function at low luminosities (Mr \u2212 5 log10 h > \u221217), here denoted \u03b12 , is\nat least as steep as \u22121.3, though it is almost certainly steeper, and perhaps as steep as \u22121.5.\n2. Galaxies at these low luminosities are low in surface brightness, close to exponential, and predominantly\nblue.\n3. Our estimate of the luminosity function is strongly affected by surface brightness selection effects at\nlow luminosities. We have taken some care in estimating the completeness in this regime.\n4. Incompleteness at low luminosities hardly affects our estimated total luminosity density because even\nwith our completeness corrections the low lumosity galaxies do not contribute significantly.\n5. There is not a large discrepancy between the SDSS and 2dFGRS determinations of the luminosity\nfunction.\n6. Comparing void, field, and cluster luminosity functions in the SDSS yields the conclusions that the\nexponential cut-off at high luminosities is a strong function of environment and that \u03b12 is not a function\nof environment at low density, but may become significantly steeper at high density.\nThere are a number of important improvements we can make to the measurements described here:\n1. With later data releases of the SDSS, we can explore more of the local volume, of which we do not yet\nhave a fair sample. In particular, we will be observing regions surrounding and including the Virgo\ncluster. This increased volume will allow a better measurement of the environmental dependence of\nthe properties of low luminosity galaxies.\n2. Deeper SDSS spectroscopy to mr < 19.5, targeted at galaxies thought to be at z < 0.1 according to\nphotometric redshifts, may result in improved statistics on the abundance of low luminosity galaxies\n(Lin et al, in preparation).\n3. Improved analysis of the SDSS imaging will allow us to detect low surface brightness galaxies. First,\nin the Southern Equatorial stripe of the SDSS, we have many epochs of imaging, which will allow us to\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\ndetect galaxies by their diffuse light. Second, Willman et al. (2002) and Zucker et al. (2004) continue\nto search for very nearby galaxies detected in resolved stars. These samples will allow us to evaluate\nthe effects of surface brightness completeness on the low luminosity slope empirically.\n4. In order to improve the sample at the luminous end, we will supplement the SDSS redshifts with known\nlarge, bright galaxies from the astronomical literature, in a statistically meaningful way.\nThese last two items will allow us to probe the regime below 10 h\u22121 Mpc, which we have excluded here\nbecause of the current incompleteness of the catalog in that regime. In addition to examining even lower\nluminosity galaxies, we will be able to perform a more direct comparison with the work of Karachentsev\net al. (2004) at these distances.\nWith the data in hand, we will be studying further the environmental dependence of galaxy properties,\nanalyzing the images to better understand the morphology of galaxies over a large range of luminosities,\nand seeking to perform follow-up observations to better understand the mass-to-light ratios, star-formation\nhistories, and dust content of extremely low luminosity galaxies in the field.\nThanks to Ivan Baldry, Eric Bell, Marla Geha, and Beth Willman for comments on early drafts of\nthe manuscript.

Each image is 57\u2032\u2032 on a side. The spectrum in each case is associated with\nthe center of the image. We have sorted them by g \u2212 r color, starting with the reddest.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 1b.- Continuation of Figure 1a.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Contours indicate the completeness of the SDSS photometric sample used here as a function of\nhalf-light surface brightness and magnitude, as determined from the fake data pipeline described in the text.\nThe underlying greyscale image is the distribution of real galaxies in the low-redshift catalog.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Solid line is the completeness as a function of surface brightness (for a direction in which fgot (\u03b1, \u03b4) =\n1. The contribution due to spectroscopic incompleteness is the dotted line. The contribution due to the\ntiling incompleteness is the dashed line. The contribution due to photometric incompleteness (estimated\nfrom simulations) is the dot-dashed line.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Top panel shows the distribution of galaxies as a function of surface brightness (determined from\nthe S\u00e9rsic fit) uncorrected for Galactic extinction, in three bins of extinction, as labeled. Bottom panel shows\nthe same distribution corrected for Galactic extinction and surface brightness incompleteness. There is no\nevidence for additional incompleteness.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Each panel shows as a histogram the distribution of surface brightness \u03bc50,r for a bin of absolute\nmagnitude Mr . The dotted line is the model of Equation 4 as fit to galaxies more luminous than Mr = \u221218.\nThe solid line is the model multiplied by the surface brightness completeness.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Estimate of possible correction factor due to surface brightness incompleteness in the SDSS, as a\nfunction of absolute magnitude. Based on fit of Equation 4 to luminosity surface brightness relationship at\nhigh luminosity (Mr < \u221218).\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- The luminosity function in the r-band calculated using the step-wise maximum likelihood method,\nwith bins of width 0.25 mag. The black histogram is the minimal luminosity function (1) for galaxies\nwith \u03bc50,r < 24, described in Section 4.1, with no correction for surface brightness selection effects. The\ndark grey histogram is the luminosity function for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 corrected for surface brightness\nincompleteness. The light grey histogram is an attempt to estimate how many galaxies there might be using\na simple model for the luminosity surface brightness relationship. The values used in this plot are given in\nTable 7. The smooth curves are double Schechter function fits to each result, whose parameters are given\nin Table 5. The bottom panel is the number of galaxies contributing to each bin. All magnitudes here and\nelsewhere in the paper are K-corrected to rest-frame bandpasses and have no evolution correction applied.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Top panel: Total number density in galaxies more luminous than Mr , as a function of Mr , for\nall three luminosity functions of Figure 7. The black line is the raw luminosity function for galaxies with\n\u03bc50,r < 24 (1); the dark grey line is the corrected luminosity function for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24 (2), and\nthe dashed line is our estimate of the \"total\" luminosity function (3), all as described in Section 4.1. Bottom\npanel: Same as top panel for total luminosity density. In all cases, most of the luminosity density (\u223c 90%)\nis contained in galaxies with Mr < \u221217.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Histogram of distances to galaxies in the sample, in 1 h\u22121 Mpc thick shells. The smooth line\nrepresents the expected number in each bin based on the best fit raw luminosity function (version 1) described\nin Section 4.1.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Top panel shows the joint distribution of distance and absolute magnitude. Bottom panel shows\nthe joint distribution of enclosed volume and absolute magnitude. The distribution of galaxies in this plot\nshows a fairly constant distribution further than z \u223c 0.015 (V \u223c 2 \u00d7 104). However, there is noticeable largescale structure interior to that, as well as some likely incompleteness at the luminous end of the distribution.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- The histograms in each panel are similar to that in the top panel of Figure 7, for the ugiz bands,\nas labeled. The black histograms correspond to the raw luminosity function for galaxies with \u03bc50,r < 24,\nversion (1) in Section 4.1. The grey histograms correspond to the luminosity function for galaxies with with\n\u03bc50,r < 24 corrected for surface brightness incompleteness, version (2) in Section 4.1. For the ugiz bands,\nwe have not created a luminosity function corresponding to version (3) in that section. The smooth lines\ncorrespond to the double Schechter function fits the surface brightness corrected luminosity function version\n(2), whose parameters we list in Table 5.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Similar to Figure 7, but showing only the uncorrected results for the step-wise maximum likelihood\nmethod (solid histogram) and the Vmax method (dotted histogram). There is complete agreement at high\nluminosity, but disagreement at low luminosity, probably due to large-scale structure affecting the Vmax\nestimate.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Similar to Figure 7, but showing only the uncorrected results in the u-band (thin black) compared\nto the results of Baldry et al. (2005) (thick grey histogram). The results are similar, though there is a 20%\ndiscrepancy at the low luminosity end.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- Similar to Figure 7, but showing only the uncorrected results for the step-wise maximum likelihood\nmethod (histogram) compared to the results of Blanton et al. (2003c). The two methods agree well.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- The histogram in each panel is identical to those in Figure 11. The smooth solid line is the\ncorresponding result from Blanton et al. (2003c), evolution and K-corrected to z = 0.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Similar to Figure 7, but showing the uncorrected results for the step-wise maximum likelihood\nmethod in the g-band (histogram) compared to the results of of Norberg et al. (2002) (dashed line). There\nis a fairly large discrepancy, much of which can be explained by the weaker luminosity evolution assumed\nby Norberg et al. (2002). The dotted line shows how the high luminosity end would be shifted if we assume\nthe stronger evolution measured by Blanton et al. (2003c).\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- Similar to Figure 7, but showing the uncorrected results for the step-wise maximum likelihood\nmethod in the r-band (histogram) compared to the results for void galaxies (Hoyle et al. 2005) and for cluster\ngalaxies (Popesso et al. 2004).\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 18.- Number density distribution of galaxy properties. All images have a square-root stretch applied to\nincrease the dynamic range of the plot. Contours indicate the regions containing 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%,\n95%, and 97% of the total number of galaxies in this sample. The upper and low triangles are identical mirror\nimages. The histograms along the diagonal show the density distribution of galaxies in each dimension. We\nhave weighted each galaxy with 1/Vmax to get the number density distribution of galaxies. The lines indicate\nthe cuts used in Figures 19\u201321. These densities have not been corrected for surface brightness incompleteness\nin any way.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 19.- Similar to Figure 18, but for the blue galaxies (those bluer than the (g \u2212 r) cut shown). Generally\nthese objects are low luminosity, exponential, and low surface brightness.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 20.- Similar to Figure 18, but for the red galaxies (those redder than the (g \u2212 r) cut shown). Note\nthe very strong relationships among absolute magnitude, surface brightness, and S\u00e9rsic index for these red\ngalaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 21.- Raw luminosity function (1) found using the step-wise maximum likelihood method for galaxies\nsplit in three different ways: using the (g \u2212 r) cut of Equation 10, at n = 2.5, and at \u03bc50,r = 21 (the cuts\nshown as the lines in Figure 18).\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
