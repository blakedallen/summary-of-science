New observations of Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies, Supernovae luminosity distances and Galaxy Clustering are sharpening our knowledge\nabout dark energy. Here we present the latest constraints.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe discovery of a possible accelerated expansion of our present universe from\ntype Ia supernovae ([1]), is perhaps the most remarkable cosmological finding\nof recent years. Furthermore, the flatness of the universe (\u03a9tot = 1) determined by Cosmic Microwave Background observations ([2]), togheter with the\nlow matter density (\u03a9matter < 0.4) inferred from Large Scale Structure ([3])\nare suggesting the presence of a cosmological constant with high statistical\nsignificance. However, the CMB+LSS result relies on the assumption of a\nparticular class of models, based on adiabatic primordial fluctuations, cold\ndark matter and a cosmological constant as dark energy component . In the\nfollowing we will refer to this class of model as \u039b-Cold Dark Matter (\u039b-CDM).\nThis weak point, shared by most of the current studies, should not be\noverlooked: it might be possible that a different solution to the dark energy\nscenario than a cosmological constant can affect the CMB+LSS determination.\nIt is therefore timely to investigate if the actual CMB data is in complete\nagreement with the \u039b-CDM scenario or if we are losing relevant scientific\ninformations by restricting the current analysis to a subset of models.\nHere first we check to what extent modifications to the standard \u039b-CDM\nscenario are needed by current CMB observations with a model-independent\nanalysis obtained fitting the actual data with a phenomenological function and\ncharacterizing the observed multiple peaks through a Monte Carlo Markov\nChain (MCMC) algorithm, which allows us to investigate a large number of\nparameter simultaneously (15 in our case). We found a very good agreement\nbetween the position, relative amplitude and width of the peaks obtained\nthrough the model independent approach with the same features expected in\na 4-parameters model template of \u039b-CDM spectra. Second, since the \u039b-CDM\nis a good fit to the CMB data, we then move to other possible candidates for\nthe dark energy component to see what kind of constraint we can obtain. The\ncommon characteristic of alternative scenarios to a cosmological constant, like\nquintessence or domain walls, is that their equations of state, wdark = p/\u03c1,\n\n\fmight differ from the value for a cosmological constant, w\u039b = \u22121. Observationally finding wdark different from \u22121 will therefore be a success for the\nalternative scenarios. We found that the present CMB and LSS data can put\nstrong constraints on the values of wdark assumed as a constant.\n\n2\n\nPhenomenological fit to the CMB data and agreement\nwith the \u039b-CDM scenario.\n\nWe model the multiple peaks in the CMB angular spectrum by the following\nfunction:\nl(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0 =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u2206Ti2 exp(\u2212(l \u2212 li )2 /2\u03c3i2 )\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere, in our case, N = 5. We use this formula to make a phenomenological fit\nto the current CMB data, constraining the values of the 15 parameters \u2206Ti , li\nand \u03c3i . For the CMB data, we use the recent results from the BOOMERanG98, DASI, MAXIMA-1,CBI, and VSA experiments. The power spectra from\nthese experiments were estimated in 19, 9, 13, 14 and 10 bins respectively\n(for the CBI, we use the data from the MOSAIC configuration), spanning\nthe range 2 \u2264 l \u2264 1500. For the DASI, MAXIMA-I and VSA experiments\nwe use the publicly available correlation matrices and window functions. For\nthe BOOMERanG and CBI experiments we assign a flat interpolation for the\nspectrum in each bin l(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0 = CB , and we approximate the signal\nCB inside the bin to be a Gaussian variable. The likelihood for a given pheph\nph\nex\nex\n\u2212 CB\n)MBB \u2032 (CB\nnomenological model is defined by \u22122lnL = (CB\n\u2032 \u2212 CB \u2032 )\nwhere MBB \u2032 is the Gaussian curvature of the likelihood matrix at the peak.\nWe consider 10%, 4%, 5%, 3.5% and 5% Gaussian distributed calibration\nerrors for the BOOMERanG-98, DASI, MAXIMA-1, VSA, and CBI experiments respectively and we include the beam uncertainties by the analytical\nmarginalization method presented in ([4]). The phenomenological fit is operated through a MCMC algorithm. The MCMC approach is to generate a\nrandom walk through parameter space that converges towards the most likely\nvalue of the parameters and samples the parameter space following the joint\nlikelihood, the posterior probability distribution. A description of the method\nused can be found in [5]. As reported in [5] we found an excellent agreement\nbetween the \u039b-CDM scenario and the model-independent fit. This result is evident in Figure 1 where we plot the best-fit phenomenological model with the\nbest-fit obtained under the assumption of a 4 parameters \u039b-CDM template.\n\n3\n\nQuintessence.\n\nSince the present CMB data is in wonderful agreement with the \u039b-CDM scenario, we can now try to extend the set of theoretical models, allowing for\n\n\f8000\n'Best fit Power Spectrum'\nGaussians(x)\n'Boomerang'\n'Maxima'\n'DASI'\n'VSA'\n'CBI even'\n\n7000\n\nl(l+1)C(l)/2pi [uK^2]\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\nl\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the best-fit theoretical power spectrum and the bestfit model-independent power spectrum.\nvalues of the dark energy equation of state different from \u22121. However, as\nalready stressed by many authors (see e.g. [6]) it is necessary to combine the\nCMB data with different data sets in order to obtain reliable constraints, since\neach dataset suffers from degeneracies with the remaining cosmological parameters. Even if one restricts consideration to flat universes and to a value of\nwdark constant in time then the SN-Ia luminosity distance and position of the\nfirst CMB peak are highly degenerate in wdark and \u03a9dark , the energy density\nin quintessence. In Fig. 2 we report the 68% and 95% likelihood contours\nin the \u03a9dark \u2212 wdark plane [7] with the inclusion of the new CBI, VSA and\nArcheops datasets.\nThe equation of state parameter is constraied to be \u22121.62 < wdark < \u22120.76\nat 95% c.l., in agreement with the wdark = \u22121 cosmological constant case\nand giving no support to a quintessential field scenario with wdark > \u22121. A\nfrustrated network of domain walls or an exponential scaling field are excluded\nat high significance. In addition a number of quintessential models are highly\ndisfavored, like, for example, power law potentials with p \u2265 1 . However darkenergy 'phantom' models with w < \u22121 (see e.g. [8]) can be in agreement with\nthe data we considered. The result is consistent with other recent independent\nanalyses (see [9] in these proceedings and references therein).\nAcknowledgements.
