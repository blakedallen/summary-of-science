It was shown that the pressure induced relative shift of Tc mirrors essentially that of the\nanisotropy. This observation uncovers a novel generic property of anisotropic type II superconductors, that inexistent in the isotropic case.\nPACS numbers: 74.72.Bk, 74.62.Fj, 74.25.Ha, 83.80.Fg\n\nIn the cuprate high-temperature superconductors\n(HTS), the canonical change in Tc with pressure is that it\nfirst increases, passes through a maximum value at some\ncritical pressure, and then decreases.1,2 It has been argued that there are at least two effects determining the\ntotal pressure dependence of Tc , an intrinsic effect and\nthe one that arises from the pressure-induced changes in\nthe charge carrier concentration.1,2 However, there are effects which make the discrimination between these contributions difficult. In most HTS the application of pressure\ndoesn't simply compress the lattice, but also prompts\nmobile oxygen defects to assume a greater degree of local order.3 This leads to relaxation effects which are both\ntemperature and pressure dependent. An exception is the\ndouble-chain compound YBa2 Cu4 O8 with a fixed oxygen\nstoichiometry. Bucher et al. [4] found that in this compound Tc increases under hydrostatic pressure with the\nrate dTc /dp \u2243 5.5 K/GPa. Subsequent studies revealed\nthat with increasing pressure Tc passes through a maximum around 9 GPa and then decreases.1,2,3 Furthermore,\nmeasurements of the in-plane penetration depth \u03bbab of\nYBa2 Cu4 O8 revealed pressure induced changes which\ncannot be simply attributed to the pressure changes of\nTc .5,6 Since in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, including YBa2 Cu4 O8 , the critical regime where\nthermal critical fluctuations dominate is experimentally\naccessible, various critical properties are not independent\nbut related by universal realtions.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 Accordingly, the isotope or pressure effects on these quantities are related as well.11,14 Here we explore the universal\nrelationship between the pressure effects on transition\ntemperature Tc , volume V and anisotropy \u03b3 emerging\nfrom the pressure induced changes of the magnetization\nnear Tc . It is shown that in the underdoped YBa2 Cu4 O8\nthe pressure effect on Tc mirrors essentially that on the\nanisotropy. This uncovers a novel generic property of\nanisotropic type II superconductors, inexistent in the\nisotropic case.\nThe polycrystalline YBa2 Cu4 O8 samples were synthesized by solid-state reactions using high-purity Y2 O3 ,\nBaCO3 and CuO.5 The hydrostatic pressure was gen-\n\nerated in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp that\nwas especially designed for magnetization measurements\nunder pressure.15 The sample was thoroughly mixed with\nFluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a\nsample to liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The\npressure was measured in situ by monitoring the Tc shift\nof the small piece of In [Tc (p = 0) \u2243 3.4K] included in the\npressure cell. The field-cooled magnetization measurements were performed with a Quantum Design SQUID\nmagnetometer at temperatures ranging from 2 to 100K.\nIn Fig. 1(a) we displayed the field-cooled (0.5 mT) magnetization M of a YBa2 Cu4 O8 powder sample vs. T near\nTc for various applied hydrostatic pressures (0.0 kbar,\n2.67 kbar, 4.29 kbar, 7.52 kbar, and 10.2 kbar). To identify the temperature regime where critical fluctuations\nplay an essential role it is instructive to consider the behavior of dM/dT vs. T displayed in Fig. 1(b). With\ndecreasing temperature dM/dT is seen to raise below\nthe transition temperature and after passing a maximum\nvalue it decreases. This behavior contradicts the meanfield behavior where dM/dT below Tc adopts a constant\nvalue.16 It implies that the fluctuation dominated regime\nis accessible and attained. This calls for an analysis beyond the mean-field approximation as outlined below.\nThe detailed description of the scaling analysis adopted\nfor magnetization changes caused by isotope substitution\nor applying pressure can be found in Refs. 17 and 18.\nBriefly, the basic principles of the analysis can be summarized as follows.

Furthermore, \u01eb (\u03b4) =\n\u00011/2\ncos2 (\u03b4) + sin2 (\u03b4) /\u03b3 2\n, where \u03b4 is the angle between\nthe applied magnetic field H and the c-axis, \u03a60 the flux\n\n\f2\nreduces to\n\u2206V\n\u2206Tc \u2206\u03b3\n\u2206M\n+\n=\n+\nM\nV\nTc\n\u03b3\n\n0.0\n\n(a)\n\nOn that condition it is impossible to extract these\nchanges from the temperature dependence of the magnetization.

Moreover, as listed in Table I, the critical\namplitude \u03bb\u22122\nab0 was found to be pressure dependent. The\nconsistency with 3D-XY critical behavior implies that\nthe transition temperature Tc and the critical amplitudes\nof the in-plane penetration depths \u03bbab0 and the c-axis\ncorrelation lengths \u03bec0 are not independent but related\nby7,8,9,10,14,20\n\nkB Tc =\n\n\u03a620 f \u03bec0\n, f \u2243 0.453.\n16\u03c0 3 \u03bb2ab0\n\n(8)\n\nUniversality implies that this relation holds irrespective\nof the applied pressure.

The solid line is \u2206Tc /Tc = 0.0068p and the\ndashed one is \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 = \u22120.006p with p in kbar.\n\nand, because of \u03b3 = \u03beab0 /\u03bec0 ,\n\nseen that the rise of Tc mirrors essentially the decrease of\nthe anisotropy. Indeed the relative volume change is an\norder of magnitude smaller. Furthermore, from Fig. 3,\nshowing \u2206Tc /Tc and \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 versus p for the estimates\nlisted in Table I, it is seen that in the pressure range\nconsidered here, both \u2206Tc /Tc and \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 depend nearly\nlinearly on pressure. Thus, under pressure not only Tc\nand the volume changes but the anisotropy is modified as\nwell. A quick glance to Table I reveal that the pressure\neffect on Tc mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy.\nIn addition, recent in-plane penetration depth \u03bbab measurements revealed that there is a pressure effect on this\nimportant property also.5 It was shown that the in-plane\npenetration depth data of YBa2 Cu2 O8 is consistent with\n3D-XY critical behavior,5 where the penetration depth\n\nUsing then the estimates for \u2206Tc /Tc and \u22122\u2206\u03bbab0 /\u03bbab0\nthe relative change \u2206\u03bec0 /\u03bec0 is readily calculated with\naid of Eq. (9), while the values for \u2206\u03beab0 /\u03beab0 follow from\nrelation (10). The values of \u2206\u03bec0 /\u03bec0 and \u2206\u03beab0 /\u03beab0 are\nlisted in Table I.\nFrom the scaling analysis of the pressure effect on magnetization and in-plane penetration depth it then emerges\nthat the rise of the transition temperature of underdoped\nYBa2 Cu4 O8 with increasing pressure is associated with a\ndecreasing anisotropy and volume V . The relative change\nof the transition temperature \u2206Tc /Tc is seen to mirror\nessentially that of the anisotropy \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3. This is consistent with the generic behavior for high-temperature superconductors, where for a given HTS family Tc increases\nwith reduced aniostropy.10,13,14 Although these changes\n\n\u2206\u03b3\n\u2206\u03bec0\n\u2206\u03beab0\n\u2212\n.\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03beab0\n\u03bec0\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nare small compared to those in the critical amplitudes\nof the in-plane penetration depth \u2206\u03bbabo /\u03bbabo and the\ncorrelation lengths \u2206\u03beab0 /\u03beab0 , \u2206\u03bec0 /\u03bec0 (see Table I)\nit becomes clear that the pressure induced change of the\nanisotropy is the essential ingredient which remains to be\nunderstood microscopically. Empirically the anisotropy\ndecreases rather steeply by approaching optimum doping\nand levels off in the overdoped regime.10,13,14 Together\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nH.
