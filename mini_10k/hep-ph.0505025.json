Among\nthe most prominent are statistical thermal models for\nequilibrated hadronic gases.\nOne result is a suppression in the yields for rare particles when treating the conservation of a corresponding\nU(1)-charge exactly [1, 2, 3]. The importance of such a\ntreatment is fortified by recent experimental results [4].\nThe suppression effect can eventually be formulated in\nterms of a volume-dependence [1].\nA dynamical interpretation has recently been offered by the formulation and solution of kinetic masterequations, which are capable of covering the time evolution of the system as well [2].\nIn the following we will demonstrate that standard\nhadronic transport models dynamically show canonical\nsuppression. More explicitly the U(1)-charge considered\nis the strangeness whose net value is taken to be zero\nthroughout our calculations. Due to simplicity we consider only inelastic reactions of the type \u03c0\u03c0 \u2194 K K\u0304,\nwhere the kaons and anti-kaons bear strangeness +1 and\n\u22121 respectively.\nAn abundant number of kaons justifies a grand canonical description of the system, in which the strangeness\nis conserved only on the average hNK i \u2212 hNK\u0304 i = 0. The\ndensity of particles having strangeness +1, the kaons, can\nthen be computed\nngc\nK =\n\n1\nZK\n,\nV\n\n(1)\n\n1\nwhere ZK\ndenotes the relativistic one-particle partion\nfunction for non-interacting particles (kaons in this case)\n\n1\nZK\n(V, T ) = gK\n\n\u0010m \u0011\nVT 2\nK\n.\nm\nK\n2\n2\u03c0 2 K\nT\n\n(2)\n\nA rare number of kaons however demands the conservation of strangeness to be treated exactly, i.e. NK \u2212 NK\u0304 =\n0. A consistent realization of this constraint eventually\nleads to a canonical partition function describing the system [1, 3] and thus to the following kaon density\nncK = \u03b7 ngc\nK,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b7=\n\nncK\nI1 (x)\n=\nngc\nI0 (x)\nK\n\n(4)\n\n1\nand x = 2ZK\n. Pursuing the kinetic master equation\napproach yields the same results for the equilibrated kaon\ndensities [2].\nInvestigating the canonical suppression factor (4) more\nclosely, using the asymptotic behaviours\n\nlim\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nI1 (x)\n\u21921\nI0 (x)\n\nlim\n\nx\u21920\n\nx\nI1 (x)\n\u2192 ,\nI0 (x)\n2\n\n(5)\n\none finds that in the grand canonical limit the kaon density nK is independent of the reaction volume, whereas in\nthe canonical regime, with the number of kaons hNK i \u226a\n1, it scales linearly with the volume as x \u221d V . This\nvolume dependent behaviour of the kaon density (3) provides a convenient reference for comparison between simulation and theory.\nII.\n\nDYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nThe simulation setup consists of a large box of 20 fm\nside length holding a relativistic gas of pions. This piongas provides a heat bath for a much smaller reaction volume of variable size centered within the large box. Inside this likewise box-shaped reaction volume processes\n\u03c0\u03c0 \u2194 K K\u0304 are allowed, covering all possible isospin states\nof pions and kaons. The kaons are reflected by the walls\nof the reaction volume, whereas these walls are permeable for the pions. After equilibration, the kaon density\nwithin the reaction volume should be governed by (3)\nwhich holds as a reference for the transport model results.\nTherefore different sizes of the inner reaction volume are\nsimulated and the number of kaons hNK i is extracted by\naveraging over many timesteps. The timesteps are sufficiently large such that no correlations are to be expected.\nWe implemented this scenario using two different types\nof transport descriptions - the microscopic transport\nmodel UrQMD [5] and a realization of a stochastic transport model borrowed from a recent and elaborated parton\ncascade [6]. The former model makes use of a geometrical\ninterpretation of cross sections in order to solve transport\nequations, whereas the latter relies on the calculation of\ntransition probabilities.\n\n\f2\n\n\u2206t\n.\n\u2206x3\n\ncascade (a=0)\nUrQMD (a=2)\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nE [GeV]\n\n(6)\n\nvrel denotes the relative velocity and \u03c322 is the cross section for the considered 2 \u2194 2 process. Any so obtained\nprobability is then compared with a random number between 0 and 1 to decide whether the collision should take\nplace or not.\nThe initial conditions in any model are chosen such\nthat the pion gas acquires a temperature of T =\n170 MeV. The appropriate number of pions and the total energy of the system are calculated via the use of a\ngrand canonical partition function for pions alone. Our\nheat bath volume of 8000 fm3 corresponds to a population of 1348 pions bearing a total energy of 747.5 GeV.\nInitially each pion is assigned the same fraction of the\ntotal energy, giving one half of the particles momenta\nin the positive x-direction, while the remaining particles\nstart out bearing momenta in the negative x-direction.\nThe spatial distribution is random.\nA fundamental and necessary verification of the simulations' reliability is of course a check for thermalization.\nFigure 1 nicely demonstrates that the energy distribution\nof the pions becomes thermal in both models.\nFigure 2 then displays our results in terms of the\nextracted kaon density plotted versus the reaction volume along with the theoretical predictions for the grand\ncanonical (1) and canonical (3) behaviour. The minor\nfluctuations in the results provide a visual indication for\nthe irrelevance of statistical errors. It is manifest that\ncanonical suppression is reproduced by both models, i.e.,\nas expected the kaon yield is suppressed with respect to\nthe grand canonical limit for small reaction volumes and\nthus small numbers of produced kaons.\nThe canonical suppression for the number of kaons\nhNK i being considerably smaller than 1, as pointed out\nin [2], originates dynamically from an enhancement of the\nannihilation process by 1/hNK i as compared to standard,\n\nFIG. 1: Logarithmic energy spectra for the simulated piongases.\n\n0.04\n0.035\n0.03\n0.025\n\nnK\n\nP22 = vrel \u03c322\n\n14\n\nln(1/(E*p)dn/dE) - a\n\nThe UrQMD model provides full space time dynamics for hadrons and strings. It is a non-equilibrium\nmodel based on the covariant propagation of hadrons\nand strings and the geometric interpretation of cross sections. For our studies it was modified such that only\nreactions \u03c0\u03c0 \u2194 K K\u0304 together with all possible elastic\n2 \u2194 2 processes remained possible. We had to choose\nsufficiently small cross sections such that the mean free\npath remained large compared\nto the interaction length\np\n\u03bbm.f.p. = (n\u03c322 )\u22121 \u226b \u03c322 /\u03c0. Otherwise the difference\nin the collision times of the involved particles viewed from\nthe lab frame causes a decrease in the collision rates as\npointed out in [6]. As different densities are involved, forward and reverse reactions are not affected in the same\nway and the change in reaction rates leads to a shifted\nequilibrium value of the kaon density. For details see [7].\nThe simulation of 2 \u2194 2 processes within the stochastic method is based on the calculation of a collision probability for each possible particle pair per unit volume \u2206x3\nand unit time \u2206t via\n\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\ncascade\nUrQMD\nc., T = 170 MeV\ng.c., T = 170 MeV\n\n0.005\n0.0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n3\n\nV [fm ]\n\nFIG. 2: Kaons density versus reaction volume as extracted\nfrom simulations with UrQMD (diamonds) and the stochastic cascade (triangles). For comparison the dashed line indicates the grand canonical behaviour. The solid line shows the\ncanonical volume dependence of the kaon density as expected\nfrom (3) for a temperature of T = 170 MeV.\n\n\f3\ngrand canonical formulation of the Boltzmann equation.\nThe reason is that any kaon in the system requires the\nexistence of a corresponding anti-kaon due to strangeness\nconservation. Thus the probability of finding a particle\nanti-particle pair turns into a highly correlated condi-\n\ntional probability. The so enhanced annihilation probability then leads to the canonical suppression in the kaon\nyields. As shown by our results, this behaviour is automatically included in the considered transport models.\n\n[1] J. Rafelski and M. Danos, Phys. Lett. B 97 (1980) 279.\n[2] C. M. Ko, V. Koch, Z. w.
