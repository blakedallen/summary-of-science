Quantum point contacts and (double) quantum dots are laterally defined using metal top\ngates. We investigate the electronic properties of these nanostructures by transport spectroscopy. Tunable\nlocalized electron states in freely suspended nanostructures are a promising tool to investigate the electronphonon-interaction.\n\nIntroduction\nThe coherent dynamics of charge states in solid-state-based quantum dots (QDs) is limited at typical experimental\ntemperatures by the electron-phonon interaction [1]. The phonon emission spectrum of a detuned double QD in\nbulk GaAs has been investigated by measuring the inelastic tunnel current [2]. Double QDs that are defined in a\nfreely suspended bridge are subject to a phonon spectrum that is modified by the cavity modes of the bridge.\nTherefore, the inelastic tunnel current of a freely suspended double QD will allow a systematic study of the cavity\nphonon spectrum and its interaction with the electronic states of the QDs. The fabrication of a freely suspended\nbridge containing metal top gates designed to define a double QD has been reported [3]. A coherent interaction\nbetween cavity phonon modes and localized electron states in a QD defined by etched narrow constrictions in a\nfreely suspended beam has been investigated [4]. Here we report on systematic studies of the electronic transport\nproperties of laterally defined suspended QDs. In these devices the charge states are widely tuneable by using\nmetal gates. In particular, we study the influence of metal top gates onto the electronic stability of freely\nsuspended devices.\n\nExperimental details\nThe GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As heterostructures (active layer) of thickness 130 nm (sample I) or 90 nm (sample II and\nsample III) are separated from the substrate by an AlAs/GaAs superlattice (sacrificial layer). In both\nheterostructures, the active layer contains a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) about 40 nm below the surface\n[5]. The ohmic contacts situated at non-suspended areas allow electric connection of the 2DEG. Optical\nlithography is used to deposit a 100 nm thick layer of nickel to protect the areas of the heterostructure that will\nlater form the 2DEG-leads. A 60 nm thick layer of gold is deposited for the contacts of the top gates and\nalignment marks. In the next step 30 nm thick top gates (5 nm titanium, 25 nm gold) are defined by e-beam\nlithography. In a second step of e-beam lithography, the intended beam area and its connection to the 2DEG-leads\nis covered by a 100 nm thick layer of nickel. This is done in the last step of lithography because the beam has to\nbe aligned accurately with respect to the gates and the nickel will be removed afterwards. Anisotropic reactive ion\n\n1\n\n\fetching using SiCl4 removes the uncovered top layers of the heterostructure [6]. The nickel layer is then removed\nby Fe-III-chloride. Finally, isotropic wet-etching with 1% hydrofluoric acid selectively removes the 400 nm thick\nsacrificial layer in the vicinity of the already etched trenches. The remaining free-standing beams are about 6 \u03bcm\nlong and between 500 nm and 800 nm wide.\nOne of our devices (sample I) is shown in the atomic force micrograph in Figure 1a. The split gate geometry of\nthese gates was designed to laterally define a double QD. The ten vertical stripes (five on each side of the beam)\nare metal top gates. They are freely suspended between the beam (dark horizontal stripe) and the sockets (dark\nrectangles at the top and bottom). The scanning electron micrograph of sample II is shown in Figure 1b. This\nimage has been recorded under a tilt angle of 85\u00b0 to better visualize the freely suspended regions.\n\na)\n\nsample I\n\nb)\n\nsample II\n\nG1\nG1\ndrain\n\nsource\nG2\n\n500 nm\n\nsource\n\ndrain\n\nG2\n\n1 \u03bcm\n\nFigure 1.

The electron\ntemperature has been determined as Tel \u2264 60 mK from Coulomb blockade oscillations of non-suspended QDs on\na similar sample. After initial illumination with an infrared LED, two\u2013terminal differential conductance\nmeasurements through the beams were performed at a frequency of f = 67 Hz and modulation voltage of\nV = 15 \u03bcV . The quantized conductance of a quantum point contact (QPC) as a function of identical negative\nvoltages applied to gates G1 and G2 (Figure 1a) is presented in Figure 2a. In these measurements all other gates\nare grounded. The lead resistance Rl = 2850 \u03a9 is already subtracted ( 1 / G= 1 / Gmeasured \u2212 Rl ). The value of Rl\n(measured two-terminal resistance R2T \u2245 3 k\u03a9 ) has been chosen so that the conductance plateaus of the first\ndepletion curve (upper curve in Figure 2a) result to be quantized in multiples of 2e2/h.\n\nResults and discussion\nWhile depleting the QPC for the first time (upper curve in Figure 2a) it shows clear conductance plateaus at\nG = 2 n e 2 / h ; n = 0,1,2,...,11. A second depletion process (after slowly sweeping the gate voltages back to zero)\nresults in less pronounced conductance plateaus showing irregular shapes and full depletion at a higher gate\nvoltage. Note, that the lead resistance is almost unaltered compared to the first depletion curve as the plateaus are\nstill close to G = 2 n e 2 / h . The lowest curve in Figure 2a was measured five days later after many depletion\ncycles. Now the QPC is completely closed at even higher gate voltages. The depletion curve shows characteristic\nresonances (local extrema) pointing to localized electron states [7].\n\n2\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\ndiff. conductance G (2e2/h)\n\ndiff. conductance G (2e2/h)\n\n12\nsample I\n11\nT ~ 60 mK\n10 el\nR = 2850 \u03a9\n9 l\ndrain 8\n7\nst\n1 depletion\n6\n5\nnd\n2 depletion\n4\n3\n2\nafter five days\n1\n0\n-1.6\n-1.2\n-0.8\n-0.4\ngate bias VG1 = VG2 (V)\n\n20\nsample II\nbridge without gates\nVG1 = VG2 = 0 V\n\n15\n\nVG1 = VG2 = -0.4 V\n\n10\n\nVG1 = VG2 = -0.6 V\n\n5\n0\n\n4\n8\ntime t (minutes)\n\n12\n\nFigure 2. a) Two terminal differential conductance after subtraction of the lead resistance as a function of the\nvoltage applied to gates G1 and G2 while all other gates are grounded. The three traces are measured at subsequent\ntimes after illumination. b) Differential conductance as a function of time for an ungated reference bridge (top\ncurve) and for different voltages applied to gates G1 and G2.\n\nSuch a behaviour can be explained by electrons that tunnel from the gates into the active layer. A tunnel current\nbetween the 2DEG and top gates has previously been reported in a non-suspended heterojunction [8]. Charges\ntunneling from the surface into the active layer produce reorganizations of the local electrostatic potential causing\ntemporal fluctuations of the conductance as well as permanent depletion. The time dependence of the\nconductance is shown in Figure 2b for different gate voltages. The top curve is measured on a suspended beam\nwithout gates. It shows no pronounced conductance fluctuations during the time period of 12 minutes. The lower\nthree curves are measured on the device shown in Figure 1b. Fluctuations are more frequent at lower gate\nvoltages. This observation supports the model of electrons tunneling from the gates into the active layer. For a\nmore negative gate voltage the electric field between the gates and the 2DEG increases and thereby decreases the\ntunnel barrier allowing a larger tunneling current of electrons into the active layer [8]. Note, that the amplitude of\nthe conductance fluctuations shown in Figure 2b depends on the strongly varying slope of the depletion curve and\nis a non monotonous function of the gate voltage. We were not able to define a double QD with this device\nbecause the gate voltages necessary to create tunnel barriers result in critical leakage currents and an unstable\nbackground potential.\n\nsample III\n\na)\n\nPL\n\nPR\n\nGL\n\nGC\n\nGR\nsource\n\ndrain\n\nd = 400nm\n1 \u03bcm\n\nc)\n\n1\n\nEC~ 0.8meV\n\n1\n0\nG (\u03bcS)\n4.3\n\nVsd (mV)\n\ndiff. conductance G (\u03bcS)\n\nb)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.38 -0.36 -0.34\nVP (V)\nR\n\n-1\n-0.4\n\nVP (V)\n\n-0.35\n\n-0.3\n\nR\n\nFigure 3.

White lines are a guide for the eyes.\n\nA revised gate design is depicted in Figure 3a. In contrast to the other two samples three gates GL, GC and GR\ncompletely cross the bridge. The gates define tunnel barriers of the two serial QDs (dashed circles). Two gates PL\nand PR (plunger gates) control the number of electrons in the QDs. The advantage of gates crossing the whole\nbeam (Figure 3a) compared to the split gate design used before (Figure 1) is, that less negative voltages are\nneeded for depletion. Therefore, we expect smaller leakage currents for the Schottky gates and a more stable\ndevice. We find that a QD is formed at a voltage VG = \u22120.275 V applied to gates GC and GR, where the\nconductance exhibits Coulomb blockade oscillations as a function of the voltage applied to gate PR (see Figure\n3b). In Figure 3c the conductance is plotted using a linear gray scale as a function of the plunger gate voltage VPR\nand the source-drain-voltage VSD. Coulomb blockade appears as darker regions (lower conductance) in the\ntransport spectrum. From the charging energy Ec ~ 0.8 meV and the dielectric constant of GaAs \u03b5 GaAs ~ 13\nwe estimate the diameter of the QD to be e 2 / 4\u03b5 GaAs\u03b5 0 Ec ~ d ~ 400 nm . A very similar QD could be defined\nbetween gates GL and GC while grounding GR (data not shown). The estimated diameters of the QDs are in\nexcellent agreement with the sample geometry (Figure 3a). The gate voltage at which each Coulomb blockade\noscillation occurs, varies over time by \u2206VG ~ \u00b11 m eV . This corresponds to a change of the local electrostatic\npotential of \u2206 \u03c6 ~ 400 \u03bceV which is larger than the phonon cavity energies of \u03b5 ph ~ 100 \u03bceV expected from\nnumerical calculations [9]. Thus, quantized mechanical excitations can not yet be resolved.\n\n-0.15\nG (\u03bcS)\n0.18\n0\n\nVPR (V)\n\n-0.17\n\n-0.19\n-0.43\n\nVPL(V)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.36\n\nFigure 4.

The voltages applied to the other gates are VGL = -0.24 V, VGC = -0.23 V and VGR = -0.23 V.\n\nFigure 4 shows the conductance as a function of both VPL and VPR while applying voltages VGL = \u22120.24 V ,\n\nVG C = \u22120.23 V and VG R = \u22120.23 V to the tunnel barrier gates. Coulomb blockade appears as dark regions (low\nconductance) in the energy diagram. Bright lines of high conductance exhibit a nonlinear dependence on both\nplunger gates, typical for the stability diagram of a double QD [10]. Black lines emphasize the two apparent\nslopes of these resonances, each corresponding to the charging line of one of the two QDs. The fact that the triple\npoints (where the bright lines of two slopes meet) are connected by (bright) lines of high differential conductance\n\n4\n\n\findicates that the two QDs are strongly tunnel coupled [11]. The characteristics of a weakly coupled DQD were\nnot observable, probably because the resulting lower tunnel current has been obscured by the apparent\nconductance fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have investigated freely suspended quantum point contacts and (double) quantum dots defined\nby split gates. Our studies reveal that the fabricated top gated devices lack the electronic stability needed to\nemploy them for detailed investigations of electronic transport through single and coupled quantum dots on\nsuspended beams. Fluctuations induced at larger gate bias are most likely caused by tunneling of electrons from\nthe gate into the 2DEG. A revised design employed gates that completely cross the bridge in order to reduce the\ntunnel currents and was successfully used to define a double quantum dot. Still, the fluctuations apparent in this\nsystem prevent a systematic investigation of electron-phonon interaction. In future, etched side gates might\nprovide a way to avoid switching noise due to leakage currents while maintaining full tunability of the system.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Stephan Manus and Alexander Paul for technical support and Jorg P.
