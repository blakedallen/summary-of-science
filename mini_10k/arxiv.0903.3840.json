In order to explain this remarkable\nbehavior, one can modify the theory of gravity [2], or construct \"field\" models of dark energy. The field models that\nhave been discussed widely in the literature consider a canonical scalar field (quintessence) [3, 4, 5], a phantom field,\nthat is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term [6], or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a\nunified model named quintom [7]. Such a combined consideration intends to describe the crossing of the dark-energy\nequation-of-state parameter w through the phantom divide \u22121 [8], which is not possible in simple quintessence or\nsimple phantom scenarios where w lies always on the same side of that bound (w > \u22121 for quintessence and w < \u22121\nfor phantom).\nAlthough one can find potential-independent solutions in field dark energy models [9], in general the cosmological\nevolution depends significantly on the potential choice. The power-law potential is a widely studied case since, amongst\nothers, it allows for a theoretical justification through supersymmetric considerations [10]. For quintessence [3, 11, 12]\nor phantom case [13] it has been shown that it exhibits \"tracker\" behavior, that is for a large class of initial conditions\nthe cosmological evolution converges to a common solution at late times [5], which can be extracted analytically. At\nintermediate times the dark-energy scalar-field is still small, but non-negligible, and one has to rely on perturbative\nanalytical expressions [12, 13]. However, such an extension to low redshift is very useful, since observations like\nsupernovae Ia, WMAP and SDSS ones, are related to this period [1]. Finally, an additional advantage of these models\nis that the field energy density remains small at early and intermediate times and thus the known cosmological epochs\nare not disturbed.\nIn this work we desire to study the quintom scenario in power-law potentials, both at high and low redshifts, and\nprovide the tracker solutions and the perturbative analytical expressions respectively. Due to the complex nature of\nthe model, we expect that the results will be qualitatively different from simple quintessence and simple phantom\nmodels, even at the tracker level. The plan of the work is as follows: In section II we construct the quintom paradigm\nin power-law potentials and we extract the matter-dominated solutions. In section III we derive the cosmological\nsolutions at intermediate times, that is when dark energy is non-negligible, but still sub-dominant comparing to\nthe matter content of the universe. In section IV we compare our analytical expressions with the exact numerical\nevolution of the quintom scenario, and in section V we provide some applications of the model, extracting two new\nw-parametrizations and discussing the cosmological implications. Finally, section VI is devoted to the summary of\nour results.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: msaridak@phys.uoa.gr\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nEARLY TIME COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION: TRACKER SOLUTIONS\n\nWe start by constructing the simple quintom cosmological scenario in a flat spacetime. The action of a universe\nconstituted of a canonical \u03c6 and a phantom \u03c3 field, is [7]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n(1)\nS = d4 x \u2212g R \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + V\u03c6 (\u03c6) + g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u2202\u03bd \u03c3 + V\u03c3 (\u03c3) + Lm ,\n2\n2\n2\nwhere we have set 8\u03c0G = 1. V\u03c6 (\u03c6) and V\u03c3 (\u03c3) are respectively the quintessence and phantom field potentials, while\nthe term Lm accounts for the (dark) matter content of the universe, considered as dust. Finally, although we could\nstraightforwardly include baryonic matter and radiation in the model, for simplicity reasons we neglect them since we\nare interested in z < 20 era. The Friedmann equations read [7]:\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03c1m + \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1\u03c3 ,\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03c1m + \u03c1\u03c6 + p \u03c6 + \u03c1\u03c3 + p \u03c3 ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nH2 =\n\n\u1e22 = \u2212\n\nand the evolution equations for the canonical and the phantom fields are:\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c6 + 3H(\u03c1\u03c6 + p\u03c6 ) = 0,\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c3 + 3H(\u03c1\u03c3 + p\u03c3 ) = 0,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter and a = a(t) the scale factor. In these expressions, \u03c1m is the dark matter\ndensity, and p\u03c6 and \u03c1\u03c6 are respectively the pressure and density of the canonical field, while p\u03c3 and \u03c1\u03c3 are the\ncorresponding quantities for the phantom field. They are given by:\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V\u03c6 (\u03c6)\n2\n1\n= \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V\u03c6 (\u03c6),\n2\n\n\u03c1\u03c6 =\n\n(6)\n\np\u03c6\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3 = \u2212 \u03c3\u0307 2 + V\u03c3 (\u03c3)\n2\n1 2\np\u03c3 = \u2212 \u03c3\u0307 \u2212 V\u03c3 (\u03c3).\n2\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nUsing these expressions, we can equivalently write the evolution equation in field terms as:\n\u2202V\u03c6 (\u03c6)\n=0\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202V\u03c3 (\u03c3)\n\u03c3\u0308 + 3H \u03c3\u0307 \u2212\n= 0.\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 +\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThe equations close by considering the evolution of the matter density, which in the case of dust reads simply\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = 0, leading to \u03c1m = \u03c1m0 /a3 , with \u03c1m0 its value at present.\nIn quintom scenario, dark energy is attributed to the combination of \u03c6 and \u03c3. Thus, we can define the dark energy\ndensity and pressure as \u03c1DE \u2261 \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1\u03c3 and pDE \u2261 p\u03c6 + p\u03c3 . Therefore, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter\nreads\nw\u2261\n\np\u03c6 + p\u03c3\npDE\n=\n.\n\u03c1DE\n\u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1\u03c3\n\n(12)\n\nIn the present work we study quintom evolution in power-law potentials. That is we consider:\nV\u03c6 (\u03c6) = \u03ba\u03c6 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1\u03c6\nV\u03c3 (\u03c3) = \u03ba\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212\u03b1\u03c3 ,\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\f3\nwhere \u03ba\u03c6 and \u03ba\u03c3 are constants with units m4+\u03b1\u03c6 and m4+\u03b1\u03c3 respectively. Note that we do not restrict the values\nof \u03b1\u03c6 and \u03b1\u03c3 a priori. However, as we are going to see, energy positivity will force \u03b1\u03c6 to be positive and \u03b1\u03c3 to be\nnegative and bounded, that is potential (13) will be an inverse power-law one while (14) will be of a normal power-law\nform.\nWe can express the aforementioned cosmological system using the scale factor a as the independent variable, since\nit is straightforwardly related to the redshift z which is used in observations.

Therefore, we consider \u03c1\u03c6 , |p\u03c6 | \u226a \u03c1m and \u03c1\u03c3 , |p\u03c3 | \u226a \u03c1m , or equivalently\nx\u03c6 \u226a 1 and |x\u03c3 | \u226a 1. Under these approximations, equations (25),(26) are simplified as:\na2 \u03c6\u2032\u2032(0) +\n\u2032\u2032\na2 \u03c3(0)\n+\n\n5a\u03c6\u2032(0)\n2\n\u2032\n5a\u03c3(0)\n2\n\n+\n\n3 dV\u03c6 (\u03c6)\n\u03c1m d\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=\u03c6(0)\n\n\u2212\n\n3 dV\u03c3 (\u03c3)\n\u03c1m d\u03c3\n\n\u03c3=\u03c3(0)\n\n=0\n\n(27)\n\n= 0.\n\n(28)\n\n\f4\nThe zero subscript in parentheses \"(0)\" denotes just these zeroth-order solutions in terms of x\u03c6 ,x\u03c3 , or equivalently\nin terms of the quintessence and phantom energy density, and must not be confused later on with the subscript 0\nwithout parentheses which stands for the present value of a quantity.\nEquation (27) can be easily solved analytically in the case of power-law potential (13). The general solution for\n\u03b1\u03c6 6= 0 (which is the trivial case of a constant potential) is\n3\n\n\u03c6(0) = C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 )a 2+\u03b1\u03c6 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the function C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 ) is related to the potential parameters through\nC\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 ) =\n\n1\nh 2\u03b1 (2 + \u03b1 )2 \u03ba i 2+\u03b1\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n.\n3\u03c1m0 (4 + \u03b1\u03c6 )\n\n(30)\n\nIn (29) we have kept only the solution part that remains small (together with its derivative) for small a's, in order\nto be consistent with the matter-dominated approximation (\u03c1\u03c6 , |p\u03c6 | \u226a \u03c1m ). This is the reason for the absence of\ninitial-condition dependent constants, which is just the central idea of tracker solutions. In addition, it is easy to see\nthat this solution remains regular for \u03b1\u03c6 \u2192 \u22122. The solution for \u03b1\u03c6 = \u22122 can be shown to diverge at small a and\nthus we do not write it explicitly.\nSimilarly, the general solution of equation (28) under potential (14)) is\n3\n\n\u03c3(0) = C\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )a 2+\u03b1\u03c3 ,\n\n(31)\n\n1\nh 2\u03b1 (2 + \u03b1 )2 \u03ba i 2+\u03b1\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n.\nC\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 ) = \u2212\n3\u03c1m0 (4 + \u03b1\u03c3 )\n\n(32)\n\nwhere\n\nThe zeroth-order solution for \u03c1\u03c6 can be calculated from (19) under x\u03c6 \u226a 1, that is \u03c1\u03c6(0) = x\u03c6(0) \u03c1m + V\u03c6 (\u03c6(0) ),\nwhere x\u03c6(0) = (a\u03c6\u2032(0) )2 /6. The result is:\n\u03c1\u03c6(0) = 3\u03c1m0\n\n3\u03b1\u03c6\n[C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\n\u03c6 .\na\n\u03b1\u03c6 (2 + \u03b1\u03c6 )\n\n(33)\n\n\u2032\nFurthermore, using the zeroth-order approximation of (20), i.e \u03c1\u03c3(0) = x\u03c3(0) \u03c1m + V\u03c3 (\u03c3(0) ) with x\u03c3(0) = \u2212(a\u03c3(0)\n)2 /6,\nwe obtain\n\n\u03c1\u03c3(0) = \u22123\u03c1m0\n\n3\u03b1\u03c3\n[C\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\n\u03c3 .\na\n\u03b1\u03c3 (2 + \u03b1\u03c3 )\n\n(34)\n\nSimilarly to the simple phantom case [13], expression (34) and the requirement of phantom-energy positivity leads\nto the constraint \u22122 < \u03b1\u03c3 < 0, that is the phantom potential is a normal power law. Additionally, (33) leads to\n\u03b1\u03c6 < \u22122 or \u03b1\u03c6 > 0, with the second case being physically more interesting since it corresponds to the well-studied\ninverse power-law potential of the literature [3, 11, 12].\nFinally, using the zeroth-order approximation of (21) and (22), namely p\u03c6(0) = x\u03c6(0) \u03c1m \u2212 V\u03c6 (\u03c6(0) ) and p\u03c3(0) =\nx\u03c3(0) \u03c1m \u2212 V\u03c3 (\u03c3(0) ) respectively, we obtain\n3\u03b1\u03c6\n[C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\n\u03c6\na\n\u03b1\u03c6 (2 + \u03b1\u03c6 )2\n3\u03b1\u03c3\n[C\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\n\u03c3 .\n= 6\u03c1m0\na\n2\n\u03b1\u03c3 (2 + \u03b1\u03c3 )\n\np\u03c6(0) = \u22126\u03c1m0\n\n(35)\n\np\u03c3(0)\n\n(36)\n\nAt this stage, the zeroth-order, that is early-time, results coincide with those of simple quintessence [12] or simple\nphantom models [13]. This was expected since the exact equations of motion (25),(26), which correspond to a coupled\nsystem for the two fields, under the zeroth-order approximation lead to the un-coupled equation system (27),(28).\nThus, at early times the two fields evolve independently. However, even at this approximation level, the complexity\nof the quintom model leads to qualitatively different results. Indeed, dark energy is attributed to both fields under\ndefinition (12). Therefore, we acquire:\n[C (\u03b1 )]2\n\nw(0)\n\n3\u03b1\u03c6\n\n2\n\n3\u03b1\u03c3\n\n\u2212 2+\u03b1\u03c3\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )]\n2+\u03b1\u03c6\n\u22122 \u03b1\u03c6 (2+\u03b1\n+ 2 \u03b1[C\n2 a\n2 a\np\u03c6(0) + p\u03c3(0)\n\u03c3 (2+\u03b1\u03c3 )\n\u03c6)\n=\n=\n.\n3\u03b1\u03c6\n3\u03b1\u03c3\n\u03c1\u03c6(0) + \u03c1\u03c3(0)\n[C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\u03c6\n[C\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )]2 \u2212 2+\u03b1\n\u03c3\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03c3 (2+\u03b1\u03c3 ) a\n\u03b1\u03c6 (2+\u03b1\u03c6 ) a\n\u2212\n\n(37)\n\n\f5\nAs we observe, although in the total absence of one of the fields this expression gives the corresponding results of\n2\n2\nsimple quintessence (w(0) = \u2212 2+\u03b1\n[12]) and simple phantom (w(0) = \u2212 2+\u03b1\n[13]), when both fields are present\n\u03c3\n\u03c6\nand despite the fact that they are not coupled at this zeroth-level, the behavior of w(0) is qualitative different. In\nparticular, as can be clearly seen, w(0) is not a constant but it is a-dependent although it is the tracker solution. On\nthe contrary, in simple quintessence and simple phantom scenarios one should go beyond tracker solutions, that is to\nintermediate times, in order to reveal a varying equation-of-state parameter. This feature makes the model at hand\ncosmologically interesting. We mention that according to the specific model and choice of parameters, w(0) can evolve\nbelow or above \u22121, or even experience the phantom-divide crossing.\nFinally, we can calculate the zeroth-order behavior of the dark-energy density parameter as:\n\u03a9DE(0) =\n\n6\n\u03c1\u03c6(0) + \u03c1\u03c3(0)\n6\n[C\u03c3 (\u03b1\u03c3 )]2 2+\u03b1\n[C\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c6 )]2 2+\u03b1\n=3\na \u03c6 \u22123\na \u03c3,\n\u03c1m\n\u03b1\u03c6 (2 + \u03b1\u03c6 )\n\u03b1\u03c3 (2 + \u03b1\u03c3 )\n\n(38)\n\nwhere we have used that \u03c1m = \u03c1m0 /a3 .\nExpressions (29)-(38) are the tracker solutions for quintom cosmology in power-law potentials. Equivalently they\ncan be expressed as a function of time, considering a \u221d t2/3 since we are in the matter-dominated era, or as a function\nof the redshift z through aa0 = 1 + z, with a0 = 1 the present value. They provide an excellent approximation to the\nbehavior of the quintom scenario as long as \u03c1\u03c6 , |p\u03c6 | \u226a \u03c1m and \u03c1\u03c3 , |p\u03c3 | \u226a \u03c1m , that is at early times.\nIII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AT INTERMEDIATE TIMES\n\nAs time passes and cosmological evolution continues, the scalar fields increase and dark-energy density becomes\nnon-negligible, although still dominated by the dark-matter one. Therefore, we expect that progressively the various\nquantities will start diverging from the expressions obtained above. We are interested in the analytical investigation\nof this intermediate evolution stage, and thus we perform a first-order perturbation to the zeroth-order solutions of\nsection II. The obtained solutions will be significant for the period during the transition from matter to dark-energy\ndomination. The corresponding quantities are denoting by the subscript \"(1)\", and the total ones by tilde, i.e:\n\u03c6e = \u03c6(0) + \u03c6(1) , \u03c3\ne = \u03c3(0) + \u03c3(1) , \u03c1e\u03c6 = \u03c1\u03c6(0) + \u03c1\u03c6(1) , \u03c1e\u03c3 = \u03c1\u03c3(0) + \u03c1\u03c3(1) , w\ne = w(0) + w(1) .\n\n(39)\n\nThe aforementioned perturbations can be equivalently considered as keeping terms up to first order in x\u03c6 and x\u03c3 (i.e\nkeeping only x\u03c6(0) and x\u03c3(0) ) and in \u03c6(1) /\u03c6(0) and \u03c3(1) /\u03c3(0) , in the exact evolution equations (25),(26). An additional\ne = V\u03c6 (\u03c6(0) ) + dV\u03c6 (\u03c6(0) ) \u03c6(1) + O(\u03c62 ), and\nconvenient formula can arise form the expansions of the potentials as V\u03c6 (\u03c6)\n(1)\n\nd\u03c6(0)\n\nsimilarly for V\u03c3 (e\n\u03c3 ).

In these expressions the complexity of the quintom model becomes clear, since they are qualitatively different\nfrom those of simple quintessence [12] or simple phantom [13] models. Indeed, since the first-order approximated\nevolution equations (42),(43) are coupled, their general solution reveals a strong interdependence of the two fields,\ntoo.

Concerning their applicability, we argued that\nthese solutions are valid at early and intermediate times, that is at both high and low redshift. In order to examine\nthe precision of our results, we evolve numerically the exact cosmological system calculating the exact quantities \u03c6(a),\n\u03a9DE (a), w(a), and then we study their divergence from the zeroth and first order formulae derived above. This can be\ne\ne DE /\u03a9DE and w(0) /w, w/w.\nachieved by examining the ratios \u03c6(0) /\u03c6, \u03c6/\u03c6,\n\u03c3(0) /\u03c3, \u03c3\ne/\u03c3 and similarly \u03a9DE(0) /\u03a9DE , \u03a9\ne\nThe initial conditions are chosen consistently with initial matter domination, since if this requirement is fulfilled then\nthe results do not depend on the specific initial conditions, as expected. Finally, we fix \u03ba\u03c6 and \u03ba\u03c3 in order to acquire\n\u03a9m0 \u2248 0.28 and \u03a9DE0 \u2248 0.72 at present. Note that contrary to simple quintessence and simple phantom cases, one\ncan satisfy these observational requirements by many different realizations of the quintom scenario (i.e many different\npotential-parameter choices), which is an additional advantage of the model at hand.\nIn fig. 1 we present the ratios of the zeroth and first order field solutions to the exact numerical values, as a function\nof the redshift.

Furthermore, for 1.5 & z & 0.5\nthe zeroth-order solution is not a good approximation (with error 15%) but the first-order one remains within 95%\naccuracy. As expected these errors are larger than the corresponding results of simple quintessence [12] and simple\nphantom [13] models, since the exact system is coupled and thus the evolution depends on both fields. Finally, at\nlate times, that is for z < 0.5, the scalar fields are enhanced significantly, dark energy dominates the universe, and\nour approximation breaks down rapidly.\ne DE /\u03a9DE as a function of z.

At intermediate times, that is at low redshifts, we have to use the\nfirst-order analytical solution, which agrees with the exact cosmological evolution up to z \u2248 0.5, within an error of\n2%. After that point, the dark energy sector enhances, it dominates the dark matter one, and our approximation\nbreaks down rapidly.\n\n\f9\nV.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nHaving tested the accuracy of our analytical expressions and having determined their applicability region, we can\nuse them to describe an arbitrary quintom evolution in power-law potentials up to z = 0.5. Clearly, the tracker\nsolutions are much simpler and can be used as a first approximation. Contrary to simple quintessence and simple\nphantom models, w presents a varying behavior even at this zeroth-order approximation level, and thus it can offer\na reliable description of the system (quantitatively up to z \u2248 1.5 and qualitatively later on). For intermediate times\ne DE , which are very accurate up to z \u2248 0.5. Here we present\none can use at will the analytical expressions for w\ne and \u03a9\nan additional simplification which allows for an easier application. Observing that their complicated form is due to\nthe a-independent coefficients (which are determined by the potential parameters) rather than the exponents of a,\nwe can make an easy shortening keeping the most significant a-terms and thus resulting to a convenient simulation\nof w-evolution. Therefore, expressing the formula in terms of the redshift z through a1 = 1 + z, we finally acquire:\nwf it z (z) = w1 (1 + z)s1 + (w0 \u2212 w1 )(1 + z)s2 .\n\n(53)\n\n1.000\n\nw\n\nfit z\n\n/w\n\nIn this w-parametrization w0 is its present value, which can be taken from observations, while w1 , s1 and s2 are\ndetermined by the potential exponents in a rather complicated way. Equivalently, we can consider w1 , s1 and s2\nas additional, free parameters. In this way, the relative large number of parameters in the fit (53) is attributed to\nthe general behavior of quintom scenario, which must be able to present a large class of cosmological evolutions.\nFurthermore, the use of three or four parameters in w-parametrizations is usual in the literature [14].\nLet us examine the accuracy of the fit (53), comparing it with the exact cosmological evolution of the model at\nhand. In fig. 4 we depict the ratio wf it z /w as a function of z for two potential choices. In this figure the value w0 has\nbeen determined numerically, that is why wf it z and w coincide both initially and finally. As we observe, the proposed\n\n0.995\n\n0.990\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nz\nFIG. 4: (Color Online)The ratio wf it z /w, where wf it z is given by (53), as a function of z, for \u03b1\u03c6 = 2, \u03b1\u03c3 = \u22121 (black, solid)\nand \u03b1\u03c6 = 1, \u03b1\u03c3 = \u22120.5 (red, dashed).\n\nw-parametrization, given by (53), agrees with the exact evolution within 99%. Similarly to the figures of the previous\nsection, the errors are larger for larger \u03b1\u03c6 and |\u03b1\u03c3 |, however small \u03b1\u03c6 , |\u03b1\u03c3 | are expected to be more realistic. The\nvery small error is due to the general and multi-parametric form of the fit (53), which allows for a very satisfactory\nfit of a general quintom evolution in power-law potentials.\nAnother useful approximated relation, that can arise from our analytical results, is the expression of w as a function\nof \u03a9DE . Indeed, since we have derived the relations w(a) and \u03a9DE (a), we can keep the most significant a-terms and\nthen eliminate a, resulting to w(\u03a9DE ). Doing so we obtain:\n3\n4\nwf it\u03a9DE (\u03a9DE ) = w2 + w3 \u03a9sDE\n+ w4 \u03a9sDE\n.\n\n(54)\n\nThe various parameters can be determined by the specific potential choice in a rather complicated way. Equivalently\nwe can consider them as free parameters, suitably fitted in order to acquire the best agreement with the exact\ncosmological evolution. Using a \u03c72 minimization routine to determine the best-fit values of these parameters, in fig.\n5 we present the ratio wf it\u03a9DE /w as a function of \u03a9DE for two potential choices, where the present \u03a9DE -value has\n\n\fDE\n\n1.00\n\nw\n\nfit\n\n/w\n\n10\n\n0.99\n\n0.98\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nDE\n\nFIG. 5: (Color Online)The ratio wf it\u03a9DE /w, where wf it\u03a9DE is given by (54), as a function of \u03a9DE , for \u03b1\u03c6 = 2, \u03b1\u03c3 = \u22121\n(black, solid) and \u03b1\u03c6 = 1, \u03b1\u03c3 = \u22120.5 (red, dashed).\n\nw\n\nfit z\n\nbeen taken to be 0.72, both in wf it\u03a9DE and w. The error introduced by the fit (54) is less than 2.5% for the examined\npotential cases, mainly at late times. The fact that it is larger than the corresponding error of wf it z , is a result of\nthe simplifications we performed in order to eliminate a and obtain wf it\u03a9DE (\u03a9DE ). Finally, we stress that fits (53)\nand (54) can be considered to be valid up to present epoch (z = 0 and \u03a9DE \u2248 0.72) although they have arisen from\nexpressions valid up to z \u2248 0.5, since the relative large number of free parameters leads to small errors and one can\nalways adjust the fit to coincide with the exact evolution both initially and finally.\nSince we have examined the accuracy of our w(z) and w(\u03a9DE ) parametrizations, we can use them at will to\ndescribe a large class of cosmological evolutions.

Case III corresponds to a quintom evolution where w crosses the phantom\ndivide in the recent cosmological past, as might be suggested by observations within 95% confidence level [1]. It is\ninteresting to see that (53) allows for a non-monotonic wf it z (z), too. Indeed, case IV corresponds to such a behavior,\nwhere w experiences the \u22121-crossing from above to below and then it starts increasing again.\nIn summary, as was mentioned above, expression (53) can describe a very large class of cosmological evolutions.\n\n\f11\nSimilar results can be obtained using wf it\u03a9DE (\u03a9DE ) from (54), where one can acquire various w(\u03a9DE ) cosmological\nbehaviors. Finally, it is easy to see, that the case of simple quintessence can be described by (53) and (54) using\n2\u03b1\u03c6 (4+\u03b1\u03c6 )\n6\n2\ns1 = 0, s2 = \u2212 2+\u03b1\n, s3 = 1, w1 = w2 = \u2212 2+\u03b1\n, w3 = \u2212 (2+\u03b1\u03c6 )(\u03b1\n2 +8\u03b1 +28) , w4 = 0, while for the simple phantom\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\nmodel the corresponding parameters are the same with \u03b1\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b1\u03c3 . However, it is more convenient to consider them as\nfree parameters.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we studied quintom models with power-law potentials. Firstly, we extracted the tracker solutions\nunder the assumption of matter domination. These solutions correspond to the general and common behavior of all\nsuch models at early times, that is at high redshifts. Contrary to simple quintessence and simple phantom cases, even\nat this zeroth-order approximation level, w is not constant but evolving, which is a result of the complex nature of\nquintom scenario. The tracker solutions are quantitatively valid up to z \u2248 1.5 (within 98% accuracy), but since this\nzeroth-order approximation possesses the qualitative features of the exact solution (varying and not constant w), it\ncould be used up to low redshifts in order to provide a first picture of the corresponding cosmological evolution.\nIn addition, we extracted the general cosmological solutions at intermediate times, that is at low redshifts, which\nis the period during the transition from matter to dark-energy domination. Such a solution can be very useful in\ndark energy observations, since probes based on supernovae Ia, WMAP and SDSS, are related to this cosmological\nepoch [1]. The comparison with the exact evolution shows that these first-order solutions are accurate within 2% up\nto z \u2248 0.5.\nIn order to use the aforementioned results in a relative simple way, we have further approximated them extracting\ntwo new w-parametrizations, one as a function of the redshift z and one as a function of \u03a9DE . Although the\nfitting parameters can be expressed as a function of the potential ones, one can equivalently consider them as free\nparameters suitably chosen to describe an arbitrary evolution. Due to the relative large number of free parameters,\nsuch parametrizations are very accurate up to present epoch. Thus one can use them in order to describe various\nquintom evolution sub-classes, including quintessence-like or phantom-like cases, realization of the \u22121-crossing, nonmonotonic w(z) evolution etc.\nThe above analysis shows that a two-field (one canonical and one phantom) quintom scenario with power-law\npotentials can offer a good description of dark energy evolution, in agreement with observations [1]. Moreover, the\nfact that power-law potentials can be justified through supersymmetric considerations [10] is an additional advantage.\nHowever, as it is usual in models where phantom fields are present, the quantum behavior of the examined scenario\nneeds some caution, since the discussion about the construction of quantum field theory of phantoms is still open in\nthe literature. For instance in [15] the authors reveal the causality and stability problems and the possible spontaneous\nbreakdown of the vacuum into phantoms and conventional particles, but on the other hand in [16] the phantom fields\narise as an effective description, consistently with the basic requirements of quantum field theory. The comparison\nwith observations and a robust theoretical justification should be the decisive tests for the present model.\n\n[1] A.G. Riess et al. [Supernova Search Team Collaboration], Astron.
