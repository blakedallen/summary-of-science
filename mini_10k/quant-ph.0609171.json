In this article we focus\non the Rare Earth Quantum Computing (REQC) system proposed by Ohlsson et al. [4]. In this proposal\nqubit states are encoded in hyperfine levels of rare earth\nions doped in an inorganic crystal host. The qubit levels are coupled via an excited state accessible by optical\nexcitation. Due to the large inhomogeneous broadening\nof the excited state, qubits may be selected in frequency\nspace and identified by the magnitude of the inhomogeneous shift. In practice qubits are prepared as narrow\nstructures in a hole burnt structure within the inhomogeneous profile and readout is achieved using absorption\nspectroscopy (see Fig. 1). Each qubit consists of an ensemble of ions centered at a certain transition frequency.\nFor this reason operation of the REQC system calls for\npulses that are robust to variations in detuning inherent\nin the proposal. Qubit interaction is mediated by the\ndipole\u2013dipole coupling. The rare earth ions within the\ncrystal acquire a change in static dipole moment when\nin the excited state |ei. This causes the excited state of\nthe surrounding ions to shift in energy, and provided the\nshift exceeds a certain threshold, resonant driving of the\n\n|e\u0001\n\n\u2206\n\n|0\u0001\n\u03b4\n\nAbsorption\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0609171v1 22 Sep 2006\n\nLundbeck Foundation Theoretical Center for Quantum System Research,\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark\n(Dated: July 11, 2018)\n\n|1\u0001\nFrequency\n\nFIG. 1: Left: simplified level diagram of a single ion.

Pulses 2\u20134\nimplement the NOT gate on the target qubit. If the control\nqubit is initially in the |0i state it is promoted by pulse 1 to\nthe excited state and pulses 2\u20134 become off resonant. If, on\nthe other hand, the control starts out in the |1i state pulse 1\nis off resonant and the NOT gate on the target ion proceeds.\n\n|ii \u2194 |ei transition is blocked. This effect can be used\nto implement a fully entangling gate [4] as illustrated in\nFig. 2\nPrevious theoretical works have dealt with the problem\nof transferring population reliably in spite of the finite\nwidth of the frequency channels [5] and the use of phase\ncompensating pulses to eliminate the effects of unknown\ndetuning dependent phases acquired during pulses [6]. In\nthe laboratory qubit initialisation [7] and basic manipulations [8] have been demonstrated with good fidelity and\nit appears that a fully entangling gate will soon be within\nreach.\nIn this paper we focus on an effect that has previously\nnot been addressed in the REQC system. Apart from the\nexcited state shift due to the finite qubit channel width\nwhich is chosen in the initialisation procedure, there is\nalso a broadening of the hyperfine qubit levels with a\nwidth of about 30 kHz. The constant but random shift of\nthe hyperfine levels within this range leads to dephasing\nbetween the |0i and |1i states and is totally destructive to\npreviously proposed gate implementations. In this paper\nwe propose gate sequences that correct for the ill effects\nof the hyperfine shift.\n\n\f2\nThe detrimental effect of atomic decay is often neglected in theoretical investigations of REQC. Although\nthis may be well justified for short pulse sequences with\nnegligible integrated population of the excited state, it\nbecomes important in longer error compensated schemes.\nWe thus present simulations which include a description\nof the main decoherence mechanisms.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section II we\ngive a theoretical description of the complex hyperbolic\nsecant pulse and discuss the effects of the hyperfine shift.\nIn Section III we investigate the effects of the hyperfine\nshift on a previously reported method for performing arbitrary qubit rotations on single qubits. In Section IV we\npropose a phase compensated implementation of a controlled phase gate which is robust to the effects of the\nfinite channel width as well as the hyperfine shift. Section V deals with the main contributions to decoherence\nand we perform a full simulation of our gate sequence\ntaking these effects into account.\nII.\n\nTHE COMPLEX HYPERBOLIC SECANT\nPULSE\n\nThe complex hyperbolic secant pulse offers population\ninversion over a broad range of detunings [9] and is therefore perfectly suited for rare earth quantum computing.\nA detailed theoretical analysis given in [10] uses the Bloch\nsphere picture of two\u2013level dynamics and shows that the\nsecant pulse, in fact, satisfies very well the adiabaticity\ncriterion during an effective chirp through atomic resonance. The Bloch sphere approach does not reveal the\nacquired global phase on the two coupled quantum states,\nwhich is important in the present quantum information\nsetting since in REQC we always address a subspace\nH = {|ei, |ii} of the full three level system and hence\na global phase acquired during the |0i \u2194 |ei transitions\nresults in a relative phase between the |0i and |1i qubit\nstates. In the following we present a perturbative treatment which reveals the global phases acquired during a\nSech pulse.\nThe complex Rabi frequency of the Sech pulse is\n1\u2212i\u03bc\n\n\u03a9sech (t) = \u03a90 (sech(\u03b2t))\n\n= \u03a9R (t)e\n\ni\u03c6(t)\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the real function\n\u03a9R (t) = \u03a90 sech(\u03b2t),\n\n(2)\n\nand the instantaneous frequency given by the time\nderivative of the phase\n\u03c6\u0307(t) = \u03bc\u03b2tanh(\u03b2t).\n\n(3)\n\nDuring the pulse the evolution is determined by the time\ndependent Hamiltonian. For a given ion with a transition frequency shifted by \u2206 with respect to the centre\nfrequency of the channel we arrive at the Hamiltonian\nH(t) = (\u2206 + \u03c6\u0307(t))|eihe| + 12 \u03a9R (t)(|iihe| + hc.),\n\n(4)\n\nwith i = 0, 1 and ~ = 1. Note that we are working in\nan accelerated frame rotating at \u03c6\u0307(t). Diagonalising the\ninstantaneous Hamiltonian we find the time dependent\nenergies\np\n\u2206 + \u03c6\u0307(t) \u00b1 (\u2206 + \u03c6\u0307(t))2 + \u03a92R (t)\nE\u00b1 (t) =\n, (5)\n2\nand the corresponding eigenstates\n2E\u00b1 (t)|ei + \u03a9R (t)|ii\n.\n|\u00b1i = q\n2 (t)\n\u03a92R (t) + 4E\u00b1\n\n(6)\n\nExpanding the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the time dependent eigenbasis we obtain the equations of motion\ni\u010b\u00b1 = E\u00b1 c\u00b1 \u2212 h\u00b1|\u2213\u0307ic\u2213 .\n\n(7)\n\nIn the adiabatic limit the coupling term h\u00b1|\u2213\u0307i tends to\nzero and the action of the Sech pulse becomes an adiabatic transfer. The equations of motion are then simply\nsolved by integrating the time dependent energies\n(0)\n\nc\u00b1 (t) = e\u2212i\n\nR\n\nt\n0\n\nE\u00b1 dt\u2032\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nWe now include the effect of the diabatic correction as\na perturbation.

We observe good agreement between the numerical result and the first order perturbative result so\nwe can dispense with higher order corrections. Note that\nas long as we are restricting ourselves to the two dimensional subspace H = {|ei, |ii} the effects of the hyperfine\nshift can always be absorbed into the effect of the excited\nstate shift. Only when we regard the full three level system do the effects of the hyperfine shift materialise.\nIII.\n\nARBITRARY QUBIT ROTATIONS\n\nThe Sech pulse described in the previous section is only\nable to implement effective \u03c0\u2013rotations.

In order to address the |1\u0304i \u2194 |ei transition we\nchoose the relative phase such that \u03c6 = \u03b1 + \u03c0.\nUsing Sech pulses we can selectively apply a phase to\nthe |1\u0304i state, i.e. effect the evolution\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u016a =\n,\n(13)\n0 ei\u03b8\nin the basis {|0\u0304i, |1\u0304i}.

A second Sech\u2013pulse is then applied\nwith the phase shifted by ei\u03b8 relative to the first pulse\nreturning the ions to the |1\u0304i state with a geometric phase\nei\u03b8 . During the two pulses the |1\u0304i state in addition to\nthe geometric phase acquires a phase \u03c6(\u2206) dependent\non the detuning from the qubit channel center. Now,\n\nwhich is an arbitrary rotation in the qubit space.\n\nA.\n\nEffects of inhomogeneous broadening\n\nThe Sech pulse offers robustness against variations \u2206\nin the resonant optical excitation frequencies. We now\ninclude in our formalism a term \u03b4|1ih1| accounting for\nthe inhomogeneous shift of the hyperfine ground levels.\nThe Hamiltonian then becomes\nH(t) =\n\n(\u2206 + \u03c6\u0307(t))|eihe| \u2212 \u03b4|1ih1|\n+ 21 \u03a90 (t)|eih0| + hc.\n+ 12 \u03a91 (t)|eih1| + hc..\n\n(15)\n\nLike \u2206, the shift \u03b4 varies for the different ions, and the\ngoal is to implement gates which are also resilient to\nthis variation.

Resorting to Eqs. (9) and (18)\u2013(19) we find\nthat when driving for example the |0\u0304i \u2194 |ei transition\nthis leakage is described by\nU1\u03040\u0304 = \u2212\n\ni\u03b4\n2\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2212T /2\n\n\u03a9R\nq\n\n\u03a92R\n\n+\n\n2\n4E+\n\ne\u2212i\n\nR t\u2032\n0\n\nE+ dt\u2032\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 ,\n\n|0\u0304\u0001\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwith \u03a9R and E+ given by Eqs. (2) and (5) respectively.\nThe population of the |1\u0304i state during the pulse is\nshown in Fig. 5. Note that with the given parameters a naive estimate of the final population would be\nP \u223c \u03b4T = 30 kHz 1.5 \u03bcs = 0.045 which is an order of\nmagnitude greater than the observed value P = 0.0043.\nIntuitively we may understand this as an effect of the AC\nStark shift. Once the field builds up sufficient strength\nthe |0\u0304i level is shifted in energy and the coupling \u03b4 is\ntoo weak to drive the transition between non\u2013degenerate\nstates (see Fig. 6). We thus understand the form of the\ncurve in Fig. 5 as follows: at the beginning of the pulse we\nobserve ordinary Rabi oscillations between the |0\u0304i and |1\u0304i\nstates. At t = 0.59 \u03bcs we find E+ = 10\u03b4 and we enter the\nregime E+ \u226b \u03b4 where the curve begins to depart from\nthe ideal sinusoidal shape. At t = 0.82 \u03bcs E+ = 100\u03b4\nand the curve flattens out and begins to oscillate due to\nthe complex exponential of Eq. (20).\n\nFIG. 6: When there is no field the weak coupling \u03b4 cannot be\nignored, but in the presence of a strong field the coupling of\nthe hyperfine levels is suppressed by the AC Stark shift.\n\nIV.\n\nA CONTROLLED PHASE GATE\n\nIn the previous section we saw how the AC Stark shift\nsuppresses the dynamics due to \u03b4 during single qubit rotations. Experimental limitations place an upper limit\non the laser power so the suppression cannot be made\ncomplete. When working with two\u2013qubit gates we may\nrestrict ourselves to a single fully entangling gate and\nthus have a little more freedom in choosing the implementation. In the following we shall consider a robust\nimplementation of a controlled phase gate.\nA naive implementation of a controlled phase gate using the dipole blockade effect is given in Table II. The\ntable is to be read in the following way. First the control\nqubit is rotated by a Sech pulse through \u03c0 radians about\nan equatorial axis of the {|eic , |0ic } Bloch sphere. Sec-\n\nTABLE II: Naive implementation of a controlled phase gate\nwith all pulses implemented as single color Sech pulses. Pulses\n2\u20133 implement an effective 2\u03c0\u2013rotation on the target qubit.\n\n\u03c60,c\n\u03c61,t\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\n\f5\n\nondly the target qubit is rotated by two consecutive Sech\npulses through 2\u03c0 radians about an equatorial axis of\nthe {|eit , |1it } Bloch sphere and finally the control qubit\nis rotated through \u03c0 radians retracing its path on the\n{|eic , |0ic } Bloch sphere. Given an arbitrary initial state\n|\u03c8i = C00 |00i+C01 |01i+C10 |10i+C11 |11i the first pulse\nexcites the |0ii components thereby blocking the subsequent excitation of the |01i component. The second pulse\nthus only addresses the |11i component, applying a phase\nof \u22121. The final pulse returns the |0ii components to\ntheir initial state.\nTwo main sources of errors affect the pulse sequence of\nTable II. First, the finite channel width causes a detuning dependent phase on each transition. This defect can\nbe remedied by applying phase compensating pulses [6].\nSecondly, the hyperfine broadening causes dephasing of\nthe qubits during gate operation. It is well known from\nnuclear magnetic resonance studies that such errors can\nbe suppressed by rapidly flipping the two levels. This\napproach is not suitable for REQC since we do not have\ndirect access to the |0i \u2194 |1i transition. Furthermore fast\noperations are unsuitable since they do not fulfill the adiabaticity criterion. We can, however, perform a robust\nbit flip (or NOT gate) using the three\u2013pulse sequence\nshown in Table III [4]. Since the Sech pulse must fulfill\nthe adiabaticity criterion the bit flip is relatively slow.\nRather than using the standard 'Bang Bang' technique\nwe must use the NOT sequence sparingly while retaining\nsome degree of refocussing. To this end we propose the\npulse sequence shown in Table IV. The sequence consists\nof a phase compensated controlled phase gate implementation interrupted by a single refocussing pulse sequence.\nThe effect of the different pulses is summarised in Fig. 7.\nIn order to evaluate the gate performance we use the\nfidelity defined by\nF = |h\u03c8in |U0\u2020 U |\u03c8in i|2 ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere |\u03c8in i is the initial state, U the evolution operator\nimplemented by the pulse sequence and U0\u2020 the ideal operator implementing the gate. The fidelity may also be\ndefined as the average of F or the minimum of F over the\nHilbert space. We are only interested in a single characteristic of the gate performance, and we shall evaluate\nEq. (21) for a single superposition input state.\nThe fidelity of the full gate implementation as a function of the hyperfine shifts of the two qubits is plotted in\nFig. 8. We observe good fidelities over the relevant parameter range, in particular the fidelity is virtually independent of the shift of the control qubit.

The initial state is chosen to be the equally weighted\nsuperposition state |\u03c8in i = 12 (|00i + |01i + |10i + |11i) and\nthe pulse parameters are \u03a90 = 4 MHz, \u03b2 = 1.28 MHz, \u03bc =\n3, T = 1.5 \u03bcs, \u2206c = 100 kHz and \u2206t = 80 kHz. Note the\nsequence is virtually insensitive to variations in \u03b4c .\n\nfor this reason it is worthwhile to consider decoherence\neffects in simulations. In this section we identify the main\nsources of decoherence in the rare earth quantum computing setup. The hyperfine ground states have very long\ncoherence times, as long as 82 ms has been reported [11].\nThe main source of decoherence is thus attributable to\npopulating the excited state.\nIn order to handle the dynamics in the face of relaxations we turn to the density operator formalism and seek\nto solve the master equation\n\u03c1\u0307 = i[\u03c1, H] + Lrelax (\u03c1).\n\n(22)\n\nThe function Lrelax (\u03c1) is required to be on the so called\nLindblad form [12]\nX\nX\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nLrelax (\u03c1) = \u2212 12\n{Cm\nCm \u03c1 + \u03c1Cm\nCm } +\nCm \u03c1Cm\n.\nm\n\n0.978\n\n0.978\n\n0.97\n\n\u221220\n\n0.984\n\n0.992\n\n0.996\n\n1\n\n0.996\n\n\u221220\n\n0.982\n\n\u221210\n\n0.986\n\n\u221210\n\n0.986\n\n\u03b4 [kHz]\n\n10\n\n0.97\n\n0.982\n\n0.988\n\n0.992\n\n0.988\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0.974\n\n20\n\n30\n\n0.984\n\n30\n\nm\n\n(23)\nThe operators Cm describe the relevant decoherence processes.

(22) for the full controlled phase gate pulse sequence. A plot of the fidelity\nas a function of the hyperfine shifts of the control and\ntarget qubits is given in Fig. 9. We observe a drop in the\nfidelity of the gate sequence compared to Fig. 8. However, we believe we have correctly identified and included\n\nFIG. 9: Fidelity of the controlled phase gate implementation\nincluding decoherence effects. The initial state is chosen to\nbe the equally weighted superposition state |\u03c8in i = 21 (|00i +\n|01i + |10i + |11i) and the pulse parameters are \u03a90 = 4 MHz,\n\u03b2 = 1.28 MHz, \u03bc = 3, T = 1.5 \u03bcs, \u2206c = 100 kHz and \u2206t = 80\nkHz.\n\nthe prominent source of decoherence and so the fidelities\nof Fig. 9 should closely resemble those obtained in the\nlaboratory. In principle the fidelity could be further increased by increasing the laser intensity thus allowing\nfaster pulses while remaining in the adiabatic limit. This\nwould be pushing the limits of current technical feasibility so we do not explore this avenue further.\nIt is interesting to analyze the connection between the\nfidelity and the lifetime Te . In Fig. 10 we plot the gate fidelity as a function of the hyperfine shift of the target ion\nfor different lifetimes (recall from Figs. 8 and 9 that the\nfidelity is all but independent of the control qubit hyperfine shift). We observe a marked improvement in fidelity\nas Te becomes longer, a point which emphasizes the importance of choosing an ion with the right properties for\nthe experimental realisation.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion we have investigated the effects of random but constant shifts of the hyperfine qubit levels in\nthe REQC system. The evolution of a two\u2013level system\nduring a complex hyperbolic secant pulse has been analysed analytically to first order using perturbation theory.\nWe have used these results to explore the consequences of\nthe hyperfine shift during single qubit rotations and have\nfound that errors are dynamically suppressed due to the\nAC Stark shift. We have presented a revised implementation of the controlled phase gate which is resilient to\nthe hyperfine shift and have shown that decent fidelities\nare possible even when considering the effects of decay\nand decoherence.\nThe fidelities are not quite as high as could be desired\nhowever this is chiefly due to relaxation and decoherence\neffects caused by prolonged integrated population of the\n\n\f7\nexcited state which is inevitable if we are to correct for\nthe errors inherent in the system. Recently Wesenberg et\nal. have proposed a single instance approach to REQC\n[13] which would eliminate some of these errors thereby\nallowing higher fidelities.\nThe gate implementation we have proposed is constructed from intuitive primitives and there is a clear\nphysical idea behind each pulse. Presumably a more\nefficient implementation could be found using optimal\ncontrol theory, possibly using our sequence as a starting\npoint for numerical optimisation.\n\n1.00\n\nF\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\u03b4 [kHz]\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nt\n\nAcknowledgments\nFIG. 10: (Color online) Fidelity as a function of the target ion\nhyperfine shift for different excited state lifetimes Te .
