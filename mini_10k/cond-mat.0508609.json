Equivalently, one can neglect the underlying\nlattice structure completely, where each spin interacts\nwith a finite number of particles, and assume that all\nspins interact with each other. In other words, one substitutes the original model by its (exactly solvable) fullyconnected version. This crude step may fail either completely, for instance predicting phase transitions where\nthere are none, or give a rather good qualitative picture\nof the physics of the model. In order to improve results\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively one must then use\nsophisticated techniques, such as renormalization group.\nDuring the last two decades, since the seminal paper\nof Viana and Bray [1], we have witnessed that it is\nstill possible to consider interesting exactly solvable versions of the original model, other than the fully connected ones, while keeping the coordination number finite. Since then, interacting spin systems on random\ngraphs have attracted quite some attention in spin glasses\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], neural networks [7, 8, 9] and small-world\nnetworks [10, 11].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Nikos.Skantzos@fys.kuleuven.be\naddress: isaac@thphys.ox.ac.uk\n\u2021 Electronic address: hatchett@brain.riken.jp\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nSurprisingly, during the last decade we have encountered\ninteresting problems that can be mathematically formalized precisely as interacting spin systems on random\ngraphs. Examples can be found in optimization problems [12, 13, 14, 15], error-correcting codes [16, 17, 18]\nand cryptography [19, 20].\nIn order to tackle this type of problems the replica approach and cavity method, fairly well understood for fully\nconnected systems [21], had to be reconsidered [2, 3]:\nwhile in the one pure-state approximation [21] a few order parameters suffice to describe the thermodynamics in\nthe fully connected case, this no longer holds as soon as\nthe coordination number is finite. In the latter case an\ninfinite set of parameters, or a function order parameter,\nis required [22].\nUnfortunately, while most analytic studies of interacting spin systems have considered spins of a discrete nature, e.g Ising spins, much less attention has been given\nto systems with real-valued variables and in particular\ntheir model realization on random graphs. Needless to\nsay, such systems are not only more realistic from a fundamental physical point of view, but are also of special\nrelevance in several contexts, as for instance in Josephson\njunctions arrays [23, 24, 25], Kuramoto models [26, 27],\netc.\nThe goal of this paper is then twofold. Firstly, we wish\nto extend the cavity method to spin systems with realvalued variables. Secondly, and following the steps in\n[28], we would like to study here the thermodynamical\nproperties of Kuramoto models in small-world networks\n[29]. Small worlds, more than just curious structures, are\n\n\f2\napparently universal and can be observed in many different circumstances: from linguistic and social networks\nto the world-wide-web (for a recent review see e.g. [30]).\nA large body of work has been devoted to the study of\nsmall-world networks, mainly numerically (see e.g. [31])\nand to a lesser extent analytically [10, 11].\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section II we introduce the XY spin model in small world networks. To\nsolve it we generalize the cavity method in Section III\nto real-valued dynamical variables to specific graph instances and in the ensemble case. We then use the cavity\nmethod on the XY small-world spin model in Section IV:\nwe first apply bifurcation analysis to calculate the continuous transition lines exactly. We also use population\ndynamics and compare the results with simulations. We\nfinish Section IV by studying the proliferation of pure\nstates. The last section is for conclusions.\nII.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nWe study a small-world network of N interacting XY\nspins \u03c3 i = (\u03c3ix , \u03c3iy ) with i = 1, . . . , N and with ||\u03c3 i ||2 =\n\u03c3 2i = 1. At equilibrium the system interacts according\nto the Hamiltonian\nX\nX\n\u03c3 i * Uij \u03c3 j , (1)\n\u03c3 i * \u03c3 i+1 \u2212 J\nH({\u03c3i }) = \u2212J0\ni\n\nThe extension of the cavity method to any type of dynamical variable was worked out by one of us in [32] and\nwe would like to recall it here. To do so, let us first\nconsider a general version of the Hamiltonian (2), viz.\n\nH({\u03c3 i }) = \u2212J\n\nCavity method on an instance\n\nThe cavity approach for diluted disordered systems\nwith Ising-type variables has been developed in [2, 3].\n\nPi (\u03c3 i ) =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the nature of the spins is unspecified (Ising, real\nvariables, spherical, multicomponent, and so on) and\nwe will require only that the partition function is welldefined. Let us assume that the graph Ge is tree-like (short\nloops are rare). It is then clear that the spins belonging\nto the neighborhood of i are mainly correlated through\nthe spin at site i. If, however, we consider the fictitious\nsituation of removing the spin at site i, then in the resulting cavity graph the joint probability distribution of\nits neighbors approximately factorizes and we can write\n\n(i,j)\u2208G\n\nGENERALIZED CAVITY METHOD\nA.\n\n\u03c3 i * Uij \u03c3 j ,\n\n(i,j)\u2208Ge\n\nwhere the first term represents a ferromagnetic interaction along a one dimensional chain while the second one\ndescribes a chiral interaction. The factors Uij are orthogonal matrices drawn from some general distribution\nD(U). Here G = (V, E) represents a graph with vertex\nset V = {1, . . . , N } and edges E \u220b (i, j), E \u2286 (V, V). We\ndenote by \u2202i the neighbors of site i and for any subset of\nvertices A \u2286 V we write \u03c3A \u2261 {\u03c3i |i \u2208 A}.\nIII.\n\nX\n\n1\nZi\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 \u2202i e\u03b2J\n\nP\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\n\nBethe\n\nP (i) (\u03c3 \u2202i ) =\n\n(i)\n\nPj (\u03c3 j ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nj\u2208\u2202i\n\n(i)\n\nwhere Pj (\u03c3 j ) denotes the cavity probability distribution\nof finding spin j in state \u03c3 j in the absence of site i. This\nis usually called the Bethe approximation. Let us now\nconsider the reverse situation where we start from a cavity graph without the spin at site i and reincorporate the\nspin i and reconnect all sites \u2202i to i. Then the physical\n(marginal ) probability distribution for \u03c3 i on the original\ngraph Ge is given by\n\n1\n\u03c3 i *Uil \u03c3 l P (i) (\u03c3 ) Bethe\n=\n\u2202i\nZi\n\nR\nwith Zi = d\u03c3 Pi (\u03c3). The marginal Pi (\u03c3 i ) is used to\ncalculate the physical one-site quantities in the original\ne Unfortunately the cavity distributions P (i) (\u03c3 l )\ngraph G.\nl\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 \u2202i e\u03b2J\n\nP\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\n\n\u03c3 i *Uil \u03c3 l\n\nY\n\n(i)\n\nPl (\u03c3 l ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\n\nare still not known. To overcome this problem we notice\nthat that we get closed relations for them if we reconnect\nall sites but one j \u2208 \u2202i\n\n\f3\n\n(j)\n\nPi (\u03c3 i ) =\n\n1\n(j)\nZi\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 \u2202i\\j e\u03b2J\n\nP\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\\j\n\n\u03c3 i *Uil \u03c3 l Y P (i) (\u03c3 ),\nl\nl\nl\u2208\u2202i\\j\n\nWe see now that eqs. (5) provide recursion relations\n(j)\nfor the cavity distributions Pi (\u03c3 i ) \u2200i = 1, . . . , N and\n\u2200j \u2208 \u2202i. Once these are known we can calculate any\nphysical one-site quantity by using eqs. (4). For instance\nthe magnetization vector M and the spin-glass parameter\nmatrix Q are given by\nN Z\n1 X\nd\u03c3 Pi (\u03c3)\u03c3a\nN i=1\nN Z\n1 X\n=\nd\u03c3d\u03c4 Pi (\u03c3)Pi (\u03c4 )\u03c3a \u03c4b ,\nN i=1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a, b labels the spin components. Note that the\ncavity distributions appearing in eqs. (4) and (5) are not\nexpressed in terms of parameters. We will call this choice\nof representation of the cavity equations the parameterindependent representation.\nIn contrast, let us go now to a parameter-dependent\nrepresentation of the cavity distributions. We denote\n(j)\n(j)\na parametrization explicitly as Pi (\u03c3) \u2192 P (\u03c3|\u03bci ).\nSince any probability distribution is defined to be positive\nthe following exponential parametrization is convenient\n!\n\u221e\nX\n(j)\n(j)\nP (\u03c3|\u03bci ) = exp\n(7)\n\u03bci,n \u03c6n (\u03c3) ,\nn=0\n\nwhere \u03bci = {\u03bci,n }n\u22650 are the so-called cavity fields and\n{\u03c6n (\u03c3)} is a set of orthogonal polynomials with respect\nto a weight \u03c9(\u03c3)\nZ\nd\u03c3 \u03c9(\u03c3)\u03c6n (\u03c3)\u03c6m (\u03c3) = \u03b4n,m .\n(8)\nWe will assume that the first polynomial \u03c60 (\u03c3) is a constant (the normalization constant of the probability).\nNow, using (7) in (5) we find the following recursion re(j)\nlations for the cavity fields {\u03bci,n }\nX\n(i)\n(j)\num (\u03bcl |J, Uil ), m > 0 ,\n\u03bci,m =\nl\u2208\u2202i\\j\n\num (\u03bc|J, A) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 w(\u03c3)\u03c6m (\u03c3)\nZ\nP\u221e\n\u00d7 log d\u03c4 e\u03b2J \u03c3*A \u03c4 + n>0 \u03bcn \u03c6n (\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nZ\n\n(j)\n\nd\u03c3 Pi (\u03c3) .\n\n(5)\n\nrecover the method of [2, 3].\nLet us also use the same parametrization of the marginal\ndistribution Pi (\u03c3 i ) \u2192 P (\u03c3 i |\u03bci ), where the \u03bci are the\nphysical fields. Then from eqs.

Finally we\ncan also write self-consistency equations for the cavity\nfields \u03bc in the ensemble. We can do this in two ways.\nLet us start from eq. (9) and analogously to the definition of the density of cavity distributions (13) we define\n\nw(\u03bc) =\n\nZ \"k\u22121\n\u221e\nX\nY\npk k\n\nk=0\n\nhki\n\nw(\u03bc) =\n\nN\n\u0011\n1 X 1 X \u0010\n(j)\n,\n\u03b4 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bci\nN i=1 |\u2202i|\n\nwe then get\n\nd\u03bcl w(\u03bcl )dUl D(Ul ) \u03b4\n\nl=1\n\n\u03bc\u2212\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n!\n\num (\u03bcl |J, Ul )\n\nl=1\n\n(17)\n\n.\n\n(j)\n\nassume that for a given set of cavity fields \u03bci there is a\n(j)\nunique cavity distribution Pi (\u03c3) and vice versa so that\n(j)\n(j)\nwe are entitled to write \u03bci = \u03bc({Pi }). Then from\neqs. (16) and (13) we obtain\n\nN\n\u0011 Z\n1 X 1 X \u0010\n(j)\n\u03b4 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc({Pi }) = {dP }W[{P }]\u03b4 [\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc({P })]\nN i=1 |\u2202i|\nj\u2208\u2202i\n\n1\nW[{P }] =\nN\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n(16)\n\nj\u2208\u2202i\n\n#\n\nAlternatively, we would like to get the self-consistency\nequations for w(\u03bc) directly from those of W[{P }] as done\nin [28]. It is instructive to notice that we can get the\ntransformations w(\u03bc) \u2194 W[{P }] from the definition (16)\nand (13) of the density of cavity fields w(\u03bc) and cavity\ndistributions W[{P }], respectively. Indeed, let us simply\n\nw(\u03bc) =\n\na density of cavity fields\n\ni Z\nh\n1 X\n(j)\n(j)\n\u03b4(F ) P (\u03c3) \u2212 Pi (\u03c3|\u03bci ) = d\u03bcw(\u03bc)\u03b4(F ) [P (\u03c3) \u2212 P (\u03c3|\u03bc)] ,\n|\u2202i|\n\n(18)\n\nj\u2208\u2202i\n\nrespectively, which is precisely the transformation\nw(\u03bc) \u2194 W[{P }] for switching between parameterdependent and parameter-independent representations\nused in [28].\nFinally the order parameters can be expressed as an integral over the density of cavity fields by using the transformations (18)\nZ\nZ\nMa = d\u03bc wphys (\u03bc) d\u03c3 P (\u03c3|\u03bc)\u03c3a\nZ\nZ\nQab = d\u03bc wphys (\u03bc) d\u03c3d\u03c4 P (\u03c3|\u03bc)P (\u03c4 |\u03bc)\u03c3a \u03c4b ,\n(19)\n\nwhere wphys (\u03bc) is the density of physical fields.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATION TO THE XY SPIN SYSTEM\nIN SMALL WORLDS\n\nLet us now consider the XY model in small worlds\ndefined by the Hamiltonian (2). The application of the\ncavity method is straightforward. We must take into account that the spins are XY, so that the integral\noverR spin\nR\ndegrees of freedom is over the unit circle, d\u03c3 \u2192 S d\u03c3\nwith S = {(\u03c3x , \u03c3y ) \u2208 R2 : ||\u03c3|| = 1}, and that the en-\n\n\f5\nergetic contribution coming from the chain and from the\ngraph is different.\nIndeed, let us define C(i) = {i \u2212 1, i + 1}. We will distinguish whenever the neighbor j \u2208 \u2202i belongs to the immediate neighbors of the chain, j \u2208 C(i), or not, j \u2208 \u2202i\\C(i).\nThen messages transmitted along the chain between two\nspins \u03c3 and \u03c4 have an energetic contribution of \u2212J0 \u03c3 * \u03c4\nwhile for those messages along the graph the contribution is \u2212J\u03c3 * U \u03c4 . Thus the message passing equations\nin this case simply read\nX\n(i)\n(j)\num (\u03bcl |J0 , 11il )\n\u03bci,m =\nl\u2208C(i)\n\nX\n\n+\n\n(i)\n\num (\u03bcl |J, Uil ),\n\nj \u2208 \u2202i\\C(i)\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\\j\n\nX\n\n(j)\n\n\u03bci,m =\n\n(i)\n\n(20)\n\num (\u03bcl |J0 , 11il )\n\n+\n\n(i)\n\num (\u03bcl |J, Uil ),\n\nwgr (\u03bc) =\n\nN\n1\n1 X\nN i=1 |\u2202i\\C(i)|\n\nX\n\nj\u2208\u2202i\\C(i)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(j)\n\u03b4 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bci\n\n(22)\n\nN\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n1 X 1\n(j)\n,\nwch (\u03bc) =\n\u03b4 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bci\nN i=1 |C(i)|\nj\u2208C(i)\n\nl\u2208C(i)\\j\n\nX\n\nIn order to have the equations in the ensemble we define\ntwo densities of cavities fields, similar to definition (16),\nas follows\n\nj \u2208 C(i) ,\n\nl\u2208\u2202i\n\nwhere 11 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix.

In order to do so,\nwe switch to the parameter-dependent representation for\nself-consistency equations (25) and apply population dynamics.\nTo do the integrals in (23) it is convenient to parametrize\nthe spin vector \u03c3 = (cos(\u03c6), sin(\u03c6)) with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0).\nThen for the cavity and physical distribution we have\nthat P (\u03c3) \u2192 P (\u03c6) and since P (\u03c6) is a periodic function\nof \u03c6 we choose a representation in Fourier modes\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\nX\nas cos(s\u03c6) +\nbs sin(s\u03c6)\uf8f8 , (33)\nP (\u03c6|\u03bc) \u223c exp \uf8ed\ns\u22651\n\ns\u22651\n\nwith \u03bc = (a1 , a2 , . . . ; b1 , b2 , . . .), which implies that we\nhave chosen, rather than polynomials \u03c6n (\u03c3), plane-waves\n\u03c6n (\u03c3) \u2192 (sin(n\u03c6), cos(n\u03c6)) with weight w(\u03c3) = 1/\u03c0.\nAfter all this has been introduced into (23) we use population dynamics to solve them. Needless to say that\nto solve the equations for an infinite number of cavity\nfields is unfeasible: we must truncate the Fourier series in the parameter representation (33). Also, we describe the macroscopic state of the\nq system in terms of\njust two order parameters m =\nMx2 + My2 and q =\n(1/2)(Qxx + Qyy ). Numerical solutions of the eqs. (23)\nusing population dynamics considering only two parameters \u03bc = (a1 , 0, . . . ; b1 , 0, . . .) are shown in Fig. 1. To see\nthe crudeness of the truncation we have compared the\nnumerical results with Monte Carlo simulations. These\nhave been done for system sizes of N = 40 * 103 spins\nand thermalizing with the Fast Linear algorithm [33].

If there were a single\npure state then the system would be ergodic, and so after\nsome transient, the state of the system would be independent of initial conditions. On the other hand, dependence\non initial conditions for long times suggests that there are\nlong range correlations contradicting the assumption of\na single pure state (i.e. the clustering property is contravened) [35]. The difference between the two populations\nof fields is measured by introducing the following parameter\n\u03bb=\n\nN\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010\n(2)\n(1)\n||mi || \u2212 ||mi || ,\nN i=1\n\n(34)\n\n(1,2)\n\nC.\n\nEquations for a given instance and proliferation\nof pure states\n\nSo far we have been tacitly assuming that there is only\n(j)\none pure state, or equivalently one set of cavity fields \u03bci\n\u2200i = 1, . . . , N and \u2200j \u2208 \u2202i, solving the message passing\nequations (20). Thus iteration of these equations does\nnot depend on initial conditions. The proliferation of solutions to the equations (20) signals ergodicity breaking.\nTo examine ergodicity breaking we follow a method similar to the one presented in [34]. For a given graph realization we take two different populations of cavity fields\n(j),2\n(j),1\nand let them evolve according to the\nand \u03bci\n\u03bci\n\nis the local magnetization for the two copies\nwhere mi\nof the system.

We have\ntaken the value of the lower cutoff of pk to be m = 1. Solid\nlines represent P\u2192F transition whereas dashed ones represent\nP\u2192 SG ones (lower lines: J0 = 0 and upper: J0 = 0.5) and\nthe dotted line represents F\u2192 SG. Small world effects play\na significant role on the phase diagram as even for small J0\nvalues the ferromagnetic area increases substantially.\n\n[28]). In this simple case, we clearly see the small-world\neffect: even for connectivity values c \u226a 1 synchronization\nis possible and the F region in parameter space becomes\nsignificantly enlarged. The impact of rewiring is such\nthat any long range connectivity value, however small\n(but finite), can lead to coherence at a finite temperature.\nA similar result based on Monte Carlo simulations has\nbeen obtained in [36, 37]. Indicatively, even for c = 0.01\none can find a P\u2192F transition temperature from (29) at\n\na finite value (around T /J \u2248 0.02).\nFor \u03c9 = 21 \u03c0, because of the anti-aligning forces imposed by the angular disorder, the P\u2192SG (spin-glass)\ntransition always occurs first (i.e. for higher temperatures\nthan the P\u2192F) and synchronization is impossible. The\nonly possible phases are paramagnetic with m = q = 0\nand spin glass with m = 0 and q 6= 0. For intermediate\nvalues, e.g. \u03c9 = 14 \u03c0 we see that one can have all three\nregions in the phase diagram, although the location of\n\n\f9\nthe F\u2192SG line cannot be obtained from our bifurcation\nanalysis. We have assumed that this is given by the line\nsegment parallel to the T /J axis connecting the triple\npoint where all phases meet and T /J = 0 [38]. This\nassumption is based on physical grounds (absence of reentrance phenomena). For \u03c9 = 41 \u03c0 we also see that increasing the short-range bond J0 leads very quickly to an\neffective elimination of the SG area (for this example no\nSG phase appears for at least c \u2264 0.01). Stability within\nthe ordered phase, for parameter regions where all three\nphases can appear, can be found using our methodology\nof section IV C. In the middle panel of figure 2 we show\nthe boundary (dotted-dashed line) separating regions of\n\u03bb = 0 from \u03bb > 0. Above the dotted-dashed of figure\n2 we have \u03bb > 0 and therefore initial conditions in the\nsolution obtained via iteration of (20) are important, signaling the presence of ergodicity breaking.\nIn figure 3 we plot phase diagrams for scale-free architectures where pk \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with m \u2264 k < \u221e. We have\nplotted them in the (\u03b3, T /J)-plane for different values of\nJ0 , \u03c9. As it has been noted in [39] for the case of Ising\nspins, we find that for exponent values \u03b3 \u2264 3 the system\nis always in a non-paramagnetic state and this is due to\nthe divergence of the second moment k 2 at \u03b3 = 3. For\nspin systems with J0 = 0 one finds that a lower cutoff\nm = 1 leads to a critical \u03b3c at zero temperature which\nceases to exist for m > 1. However, for systems on small\nworlds (J0 6= 0) we see that m = 1 can no longer lead to\nsuch a transition as even an infinitesimally small number\nof long range short-cuts is sufficient to guarantee a ferromagnetic state at zero temperature. Again, the small\nworld effect is striking. In fig. 3 we compare the phase\ndiagrams for J0 = 0 and J0 = 0.5. We see that even a relatively small coupling strength J0 guarantees coherence\nat finite temperatures and also for small values of \u03b3. As\nin the case of Poisson random graphs, without angular\ndisorder (\u03c9 = 0) there can only be a P\u2192F transition,\nwhereas for \u03c9 = 12 \u03c0 only a P\u2192SG. Notice also that by\nincreasing the lower cutoff value m the area where coherence occurs is further enlarged, as expected, since the\nmean connectivity on the graph also grows. The dottedline separating the SG and ferromagnetic phase is based\non the Parisi-Toulouse hypothesis [38]. Due to numerical\ndifficulties with population dynamics at low \u03b3 we were\nunable to calculate the ergodicity breaking line with sufficient accuracy in this case.\n\ncroscopic elements interact with one another. Typically,\nonly a vanishingly small fraction of the system, containing a finite number of other nodes, can communicate directly with any given node. Cooperativity on such networks can vary significantly depending upon parameters\nsuch as the degree distribution or a superimposed smallworld structure. As such interaction structures are commonly found in a wide range of real networks in recent\nyears they have attracted the attention of both experimentalists and theorists alike. From a theoretical standpoint the notion of 'local neighborhoods' opens up new\ndirections towards theories of finite dimensional systems.\nIn this paper we have adapted the techniques developed in [28] for the cavity method to study small-world\neffects in spin systems with real-valued variables defined\non the unit circle. Such systems are not only significant from a physical point of view, but are also of special relevance in the context of e.g. Josephson junctions\n[23, 24, 25] and coupled oscillator systems [26]. In special\ncases where the degree distribution is given exactly (e.g.\nPoisson or scale-free) we have performed a bifurcation\nanalysis and derived phase diagrams. From our results\nwe see that superimposing a small-world structure significantly enlarges the region in parameter space where\nsynchronization is possible; even for very small shortrange coupling strengths and in the presence of disorder\nthe system is able to synchronize. For scale-free architectures similar small-world effects are visible again for\nvery small connectivity values. Interestingly, for a lower\ncutoff of the scale free distribution m = 1 the system\nalways finds itself in a synchronized state along the zero\ntemperature axis. This effect is solely due to the small\nworld architecture.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nComplex networks constitute an important area of research by virtue of the architecture through which mi-\n\nN. S.
