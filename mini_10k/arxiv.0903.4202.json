Combining\nthe RASS Bright and Faint Source Catalogs yields an average of about three X-ray sources per square\ndegree. However, while X-ray source counterparts are known to range from distant quasars to nearby\nM dwarfs, the RASS data alone are often insufficient to determine the nature of an X-ray source. As\na result, large-scale follow-up programs are required to construct samples of known X-ray emitters.\nWe use optical data produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify 709 stellar X-ray\nemitters cataloged in the RASS and falling within the SDSS Data Release 1 footprint. Most of these\nare bright stars with coronal X-ray emission unsuitable for SDSS spectroscopy, which is designed\nfor fainter objects (g > 15 mag). Instead, we use SDSS photometry, correlations with the Two\nMicron All Sky Survey and other catalogs, and spectroscopy from the Apache Point Observatory\n3.5-m telescope to identify these stellar X-ray counterparts. Our sample of 707 X-ray emitting F,\nG, K, and M stars is one of the largest X-ray selected samples of such stars. We derive distances to\nthese stars using photometric parallax relations appropriate for dwarfs on the main sequence, and use\nthese distances to calculate LX . We also identify a previously unknown cataclysmic variable (CV)\nas a RASS counterpart. Separately, we use correlations of the RASS and the SDSS spectroscopic\ncatalogs of CVs and white dwarfs (WDs) to study the properties of these rarer X-ray emitting stars.\nWe examine the relationship between (fX /fg ) and the equivalent width of the H\u03b2 emission line for\n46 X-ray emitting CVs and discuss tentative classifications for a subset based on these quantities. We\nidentify 17 new X-ray emitting DA (hydrogen) WDs, of which three are newly identified WDs. We\nreport on follow-up observations of three candidate cool X-ray emitting WDs (one DA and two DB\n(helium) WDs); we have not confirmed X-ray emission from these WDs.\nSubject headings: surveys - X-rays:stars\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nX-ray data obtained since the 1970s have shown\ndefinitively that stellar X-ray emitters are present\namong almost all stellar classes (e.g., Harnden et al.\n1979; Cassinelli & Swank 1983; Stocke et al. 1983;\nSchmitt et al. 1995; Motch et al. 1998; Zickgraf et al.\n2003; Rogel et al. 2006), with the emission mechanism\nbeing different for early and late-type stars; only evolved\nK and M stars and perhaps A stars do not appear to be\nX-ray emitters (e.g., Ayres et al. 1981; Antiochos et al.\n1986; Haisch et al. 1991; Daniel et al. 2002). However,\nwithin a stellar class\u2013particularly among late-type stars\u2013\nthe strength of the X-ray emission varies greatly.

Xray spectroscopy with the Chandra X-ray Observatory\nand XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory, occasionally in\nconjunction with observations at other wavelengths, is\nproviding unprecedented insight into these connections\n(e.g., Osten et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2005; Hussain et al.\n2007). Before such studies can be conducted, however,\ncatalogs of confirmed X-ray emitting stars from all areas\nof the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram need to be compiled\nand broadly characterized.\nWe have identified a sample of stellar X-ray emitters cataloged in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS;\nVoges et al. 1999) and falling within the footprint of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000)\nData Release 1 (DR1; Abazajian et al. 2003). We produced a two-part catalog. One part includes 231 stars\nthat are previously cataloged, e.g., in SIMBAD or in\nthe NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)9 , but\nnot identified as X-ray source counterparts. Another\n478 entries are new stellar X-ray source identifications\nmade on the basis of spectroscopic observations with the\nAstrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope at\n9 This research has made use of the SIMBAD database, which\nis operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France, and of the NASA/IPAC\nExtragalactic Database and Infrared Science Archive, which are\noperated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\nof Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration.\n\n\f2\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nthe Apache Point Observatory (APO). The vast majority of these stars are F, G, K, and M stars (707 stars),\nalthough we identify a new cataclysmic variable (CV)\nin our APO data; the SIMBAD sample also includes a\nnewly identified X-ray emitting white dwarf (WD). To\nexpand the sample of X-ray emitting CVs and WDs, we\ncorrelated the SDSS spectroscopic catalogs of these objects (Szkody et al. 2002, 2003, 2004a, 2005, 2006, 2007;\nEisenstein et al. 2006) with the RASS to identify the Xray emitters among these more exotic stars. In a previous\npaper we described our efforts to use the RASS and SDSS\nto identify new isolated neutron stars, which are possibly\nthe rarest stellar X-ray emitters (Ag\u00fceros et al. 2006).\nIn Section 2, we review other efforts to construct large\nsamples of X-ray emitting stars; we also provide a brief\ndescription of SDSS, as well as a summary of the challenges of using SDSS to identify RASS stellar X-ray emitters. In Section 3, we outline the process by which we\nconstructed our list of candidate DR1 stellar counterparts to RASS sources. In Section 4, we describe how\nwe confirmed our stellar identifications, thereby obtaining our sample of stellar X-ray sources. We distinguish\nbetween previously cataloged stars we identify as X-ray\nsources and stars for which we obtained spectra with the\nAPO 3.5-m telescope. In Section 5, we begin by calculating distances and X-ray luminosities for 662 stars\nin our catalog, compare our identifications to those of\nFlesch & Hardcastle (2004) and of Parejko et al. (2008)\nfor sources that also appear in their catalogs, and describe the data in our main catalog, which includes the\nX-ray, optical, and infrared information for our 709 stellar X-ray sources. We also estimate the overall reliability\n< 10% are likely to\nof our identifications; we find that \u223c\nbe false associations. In Section 6, we present the results\nof a parallel effort to use correlations of the SDSS spectroscopic catalogs of CVs and of WDs with the RASS to\nconstruct catalogs of these rarer stellar X-ray emitters.\nWe also report on follow-up Chandra and XMM observations of several candidate cool X-ray emitting WDs. We\nconclude in Section 7.\n2. IDENTIFYING STELLAR X-RAY SOURCES...\n2.1. using optical photometry and spectroscopy\n\nThe Einstein Observatory provided the first large samples of X-ray sources. The Medium Sensitivity Survey (MSS; Gioia et al. 1984) and the Extended MediumSensitivity Survey (EMSS; Gioia et al. 1990) collected\nserendipitously detected sources with fluxes between \u223c\n5\u00d710\u221214 and 3\u00d710\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.3\u22123.5 keV\nenergy band. Because survey X-ray data are often insufficient to determine unambiguously the nature of a source,\nextensive optical follow-up was required to identify the\n112 MSS and the 835 EMSS sources. Stocke et al. (1983)\nused the MSS to confirm that a given class of X-ray\nemitters has a fairly narrow range of possible X-ray-tooptical flux ratios (e.g., for active galactic nuclei (AGN),\n\u22121.0 \u2264 log (fX /fV ) \u2264 +1.2), and that the overlap\nbetween broad classes (e.g., Galactic and extragalactic\nsources) is fairly small. They found that \u223c 25% of\nMSS sources were coronally emitting stars, primarily\nlate-type dwarfs; they also found one cataclysmic variable (CV). Stocke et al. (1991) used the MSS results to\nidentify plausible counterparts to EMSS sources based on\ntheir (fX /fopt ). Still, confirming that these counterparts\n\nwere X-ray sources was very time-intensive: Stocke et al.\n(1991) obtained two to five spectra in each X-ray error\ncircle. Six to eight nights a year over seven years were\nneeded at the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory,\nMt. Hopkins, AZ, to identify 665 sources. This work\nconfirmed that \u223c 25% of Einstein detected-sources are\nGalactic stars.\nSimilar efforts have been undertaken to identify some\nof the \u223c 125, 000 sources detected at soft X-ray energies (0.1 \u2212 2.4 keV) by ROSAT as part of its AllSky Survey. The RASS Bright Source Catalog (BSC;\nVoges et al. 1999) includes 18, 811 sources with count\nrates \u2265 0.05 cts s\u22121 and \u2265 15 counts; the Faint Source\nCatalog (FSC; Voges et al. 2000) lists another 105, 924\nwith < 0.05 cts s\u22121 . A relatively small fraction of RASS\nsources can be identified from correlations with existing\ncatalogs. Bade et al. (1998) found matches to 35% of a\nsample of 80, 000 RASS sources in SIMBAD and NED.\nTo identify other BSC sources, Bade et al. (1998) used\nobjective prism spectra obtained during the Hamburg\nQuasar Survey (HQS; Hagen et al. 1995) and found candidate counterparts for 81.2% of the 3847 sources within\nthe HQS footprint. Of these, 155 (4%) were M stars,\n136 (3.5%) K stars, 4 (0.1%) F or G stars; a further\n956 (24.9%) were saturated bright stars (B \u2264 14 mag),\nfor which no spectral class is available. There were also\n31 WDs (0.8%), and 16 CVs (0.4%). There are uncertainties associated with these identifications; the spectra\nare fairly low-resolution, for example (R \u2248 100 at H\u03b3).\nBut the RASS/HQS program suggests that one-third of\nROSAT -detected sources are Galactic stars.\nZickgraf et al. (2003) applied this method to identify\nall 5341 RASS BSC sources with \u03b4 \u2265 0\u25e6 and Galactic\nlatitudes |b| \u2265 30\u25e6 ; the total area covered was 10, 313\ndeg2 . Candidate counterparts were found for 82.2% of\nthe RASS sources; the \"missing\" counterparts are faint\noptical objects whose poor-quality prism spectra preclude classification. The fraction of the 5341 BSC sources\ndue to coronal emission from stars increases from 33% to\n\u223c 38% when one includes the likely stellar sources among\nthe missing counterparts (Zickgraf et al. 2003). The difference between this fraction and that of stellar sources\nin the EMSS may be due to the different energy sensitivities of ROSAT and Einstein (Zickgraf et al. 2003).\nThe final RASS/HQS sample includes 197 M stars, 141\nK stars, 45 F/G stars, and 1219 saturated stars without\nspectral classifications, along with 45 WDs and 26 CVs.\n2.2. using catalog matching\n\nParallel efforts have been made to produce large-scale\ncatalogs of RASS counterparts without spectroscopy.\nVoges et al. (1999) correlated the 18, 811 BSC sources\nwith a number of existing catalogs\u2013for example, of bright\nstars (Tycho; H\u00f8g et al. 1998) or of radio and ultraviolet\n(UV) sources (FIRST, NVSS, and EUVE; Becker et al.\n1995; Condon et al. 1998; Bowyer et al. 1996). They\nfound at least one cataloged counterpart within 90\u2032\u2032 for\n90% of BSC sources. 7117 X-ray sources had a single\ncataloged counterpart, which Voges et al. (1999) used to\nestablish the overall statistical properties of the catalog: 58% have Galactic counterparts. This matching was\nbased primarily on positional coincidence and relied on\nthe relatively low surface densities of BSC sources and of\nthe various candidate counterparts (Voges et al. 1999).\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\nRutledge et al. (2000) matched the BSC to the USNO\nA\u22122 catalog (Monet et al. 1998). Factoring in both the\nproximity and the USNO B of objects found within\n75\u2032\u2032 of the RASS sources, and estimating the contamination rate by comparisons to background fields, they\nsifted through > 320, 000 possible optical counterparts\nto identify those with the highest probability of being\nX-ray sources. The resulting catalog includes 11, 301\nBSC sources for which Rutledge et al. (2000) identified\na USNO object with a \u2265 50% probability of being the\ncounterpart; 2705 had a probability \u2265 98%.\nIn an even more ambitious effort, Flesch & Hardcastle\n(2004) matched X-ray data from all of the major ROSAT\ncatalogs to multiple radio and optical surveys, thereby\ncreating an all-sky catalog of radio/optical counterparts\nto some 500, 000 X-ray sources. Nearly 120, 000 of these\nsources were previously identified, while an additional\n86, 000 are estimated to be 40% to 99% likely to be previously unknown quasars (QSOs). The likelihood of a\ngiven association was calculated first by examining the\nproximity of a proposed counterpart, its B \u2212R color, and\nits optical classification, and then by comparing the density of all candidate counterparts with these properties\nto their all-sky density (Flesch & Hardcastle 2004).\n\nFig. 1.- Solid line: distribution of separations between RASS\nsources and nearby bright/saturated SDSS objects with 2MASS\ncounterparts. Dashed line: distribution of separations returned by\nmatching shifted X-ray sources to SDSS/2MASS objects.\n\nThese catalogs are very useful for developing a statistical sample of a given category of X-ray emitters, typically QSOs (e.g, Bauer et al. 2000; Flesch & Hardcastle\n2004). (There is usually almost no discussion of the stellar X-ray sources.) However, because they rely largely\non the properties of known counterparts to identify new\ncounterparts, the catalogs cannot tell us more about the\noverall properties of X-ray sources than the smaller catalogs on which they are based (Flesch & Hardcastle 2004).\nIn that sense, these catalog-based approaches cannot\nfully replace the combined photometric and spectroscopic\nmethod developed to identify Einstein sources.\nFurthermore, detailed analysis of selected subsets of these catalogs can reveal problems with\n\n3\n\nthe claimed identifications. For example, intrigued\nby apparent anomalies in the spatial distribution\nof QSOs in the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) catalog,\nL\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2008) investigated a subsample\nof 41 QSO candidates to test the reliability of their assigned QSO likelihoods. They found that only 12 were\nactual QSOs, and that the catalog likelihoods were particularly unreliable for bright objects (B \u2264 15.1 mag),\nwhere none of the 13 Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) candidates was in fact a QSO.\n2.3. using SDSS\n\nPrevious to this work, the Zickgraf et al. (2003) catalog was the single largest sample of RASS stellar sources\nfor which counterparts have been spectroscopically confirmed. In fact, only \u223c 10% of RASS BSC/FSC sources\nare identified and fully characterized (McGlynn et al.\n2004; Mickaelian et al. 2006), with the majority of the\nidentifications being of BSC sources. Large-scale programs to find the counterparts to RASS sources are still\nvery much needed.\nSDSS provides uniform optical photometric and spectroscopic data with which to correlate the RASS catalogs. The survey produces u, g, r, i, z images to a depth\nof r \u223c 22.5 mag (Fukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 1998;\nHogg et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002; Gunn et al. 2006),\nwith a photometric accuracy of \u223c 0.02 mag (Ivezi\u0107 et al.\n2004); Tucker et al. (2006) describe the photometric\npipeline. The imaging survey covers 8420 deg2 and includes photometric data for over 108 stars and a similar\nnumber of galaxies. SDSS is also a spectroscopic survey,\nand has obtained spectra for \u223c 8 \u00d7 105 galaxies, \u223c 105\nQSOs, and \u223c 2 \u00d7 105 stars.\nSDSS is an ideal tool for systematically identifying large numbers of ROSAT sources (e.g., X-ray\nemitting AGN or galaxies; Anderson et al. 2003, 2007;\nParejko et al. 2008). However, the vast majority of stellar X-ray emitters cataloged in the RASS are unlikely to\nbe discovered from routine SDSS spectroscopy. Relative\nto their optical output, the most X-ray luminous normal\nstars (i.e., coronal emitters) have log (fX /fopt ) \u223c \u22121\n(Maccacaro et al. 1988) and so almost all are optically\nbrighter than the g \u2248 15 mag SDSS spectroscopic limit.\nWe have therefore combined the SDSS photometric\ndata with infrared data from the Two Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006) to select a sample of bright stars near BSC/FSC positions. When available, we used existing catalog data to classify the stars.\nIn many cases, however, no spectral class is available,\nand we therefore used the APO 3.5-m telescope to obtain spectra for objects in about 900 of these RASS error\ncircles (the total number of spectra collected is close to\n1200). We then used a spectral-template fitting code\nto classify the likely counterparts by spectral type. We\nalso estimated (fX /fopt ) ratios for all the stars based\non their cataloged magnitudes and compared the ratios\nto those of known X-ray emitters of the same spectral\ntype, thereby verifying that these stars are indeed plausible RASS source counterparts. Each of these steps is\ndescribed in detail in the following sections.\n3. SELECTING X-RAY EMITTING STARS FROM THE\nRASS AND SDSS DR1\n\n\f4\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nFig. 2.- Left panel: distribution of positional offsets between the RASS sources and the SIMBAD stars. Right panel: the same\ndistribution, expressed in terms of the cataloged X-ray positional uncertainty.\n\nWe matched the \u223c 125, 000 RASS X-ray source positions to those of the SDSS Data Release 1 (DR1;\nAbazajian et al. 2003) stripes; each SDSS stripe is a 2.5deg-wide rectangle of sky. We found matches for 7464\nRASS sources, or just under 6% of the catalogs' entries.\nSince the DR1 area is 2099 deg2 (Abazajian et al. 2003),\nor roughly 5% of the entire sky, this number is consistent\nwith a naive surface density expectation10 .\nWe queried the SDSS photometric database using the\nSDSS Query Analyzer (sdssQA) to identify bright stars\nnear these RASS sources; see Ag\u00fceros (2006) for details.\nThis query returned coordinates, PSF magnitudes11 , and\nautomatically assigned morphology type (star or galaxy)\nfor objects with g or r < 16 mag, subject to a small\nnumber of tests of the objects' photometric flags.\nThe output from sdssQA was matched to the RASS\nsources in the DR1 footprint. This matching produced\n< 5000 RASS sources with a bright/saturated\na list of \u223c\nSDSS object within 1\u2032 , roughly two-thirds of the total\nnumber of RASS/DR1 sources. However, visual inspection of the SDSS images for these sources revealed that a\nsignificant fraction did not have a nearby bright object12 .\nWhile a more conservative set of photometric cuts might\neliminate many contaminants, it might also remove the\nreal but saturated objects in which we are interested. We\ntherefore used the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;\nSkrutskie et al. 2006) to confirm the existence of bright\nSDSS objects in the RASS error circles. While SDSS is\na much deeper survey than 2MASS, whose J, H, and Ks\nlimits are \u223c 14 mag, the two surveys are well matched at\nthe bright end (r \u2264 16), and our target sample of bright\nSDSS objects should be detected by 2MASS.\nAccordingly, the 2MASS catalog was queried for\nmatches to the 5000 SDSS objects. The typical positional\nuncertainties for point sources in both surveys are on the\n10 The quoted DR1 area is for the imaging survey; the DR1\nspectroscopic area is 1360 deg2 .\n11 PSF fitting provides better estimates of isolated star magnitudes; see Stoughton et al. (2002).\n12 We used the SDSS image list tool to examine our error circles\n(Nieto\u2013Santisteban et al. 2004).\n\norder of a fraction of an arcsecond (e.g., Finlator et al.\n2000; Pier et al. 2003); the median separation between\nmatches was 0.22\u2032\u2032 . This matching left us with a list\nof 2520 bright/saturated SDSS objects with a nearby\n2MASS counterpart within 1\u2032 of a RASS source. In Figure 1 we show the normalized histogram of the resulting\nRASS/SDSS separations \u2264 30\u2032\u2032 .\nTo estimate the likelihood of false matches, we shifted\nthe positions of RASS sources in the DR1 footprint by\n2\u2032 in declination and searched for nearby SDSS objects\nwith 2MASS counterparts in the same manner as described above. Figure 1 shows the (dashed) normalized\nhistogram for this control sample. The number of false\nmatches rises with separation, as expected. The normalization is the same as for the previous matches, so\nthat the dashed histogram gives an upper limit to the\ncontamination of our sample by chance superpositions of\nindependent RASS sources and optical/IR objects. At\n25\u2032\u2032 , the cumulative contamination is \u223c 35%. Absent\nother information, e.g., the brightness or nature of the\nproposed counterpart, positional proximity alone is generally insufficient to make secure RASS source identifications from SDSS/2MASS data. We return to the question of contamination by false matches in \u00a7 5.4, after we\nhave assembled our final catalog.\nIn general, the SDSS spectroscopic database does not\nprovide the needed additional information to identify\nstellar RASS counterparts. As objects brighter than\n\u223c 15 mag are rarely targeted, the RASS counterparts\nmost likely to be targeted for spectroscopy are QSOs and\nother AGN, since they tend to be optically fainter than\nX-ray emitting stars (cf. Anderson et al. 2003, 2007). In\n2003 Sep, \u223c 680, 000 SDSS spectra were available, a sample we defined as making up the DR1 spectroscopic survey, yet only \u223c 70 of our matched RASS/SDSS/2MASS\nobjects have an associated SDSS spectrum. Clearly, the\nmajority of our RASS DR1 sources cannot therefore be\ndirectly identified from SDSS spectroscopy.\n4. THE RASS/SDSS DR1 CATALOG OF STELLAR X-RAY\nSOURCES\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\n\n5\n\nTo identify new stellar X-ray sources, we begin by\nsearching SIMBAD to find stars with known spectral\ntypes recovered in our RASS/SDSS correlation. Among\nthese are a subset of previously identified X-ray sources,\nto which we add the (optically bright) cataloged stars\nwith small offsets relative to the RASS positions to construct flux ratio distributions. Using spectral types obtained from our APO observations, we then find those\npreviously uncatalogued stars whose log (fX /fJ ) falls\nwithin the 2\u03c3 range obtained from our RASS/SIMBAD\nsample. Our final catalog includes these stars along with\nthose cataloged in SIMBAD but not previously identified\nas RASS sources. The steps in constructing this catalog\nare described in detail below.\n4.1. RASS/SIMBAD stars\nWe searched SIMBAD for cataloged candidate stellar counterparts to our 2520 matched RASS sources\nand found 457 stars with an associated spectral\ntype. Examining the literature, we determined that\n159 of these stars were previously associated with\nROSAT X-ray sources (e.g., by Dempsey et al. 1993;\nAppenzeller et al. 1998; Fleming 1998; H\u00fcnsch et al.\n1998a,b; Metanomski et al. 1998; H\u00fcnsch et al. 1999;\nSchwope et al. 2000; Zickgraf et al. 2003) and more\nrarely with sources detected by Einstein (e.g., by\nTopka et al. 1982; Fleming et al. 1989a,b; Stocke et al.\n1991; Drake et al. 1992) or by an even earlier X-ray mission (e.g., the RS CVn systems DM UMa, detected by\nthe High Energy Astrophysics Observatory-1 and IN Vir,\nby EXOSAT; Walter et al. 1980; Giommi et al. 1991). In\nfour additional cases the stars were listed as the RASS\nsource counterparts, but the origin of the association was\nunclear13 . Conversely, 294 of these SIMBAD stars had\nnot been associated with an X-ray source.\nUnsurprisingly, these stars tend to be optically very\nbright. 427 have a cataloged V ; for these, the median\nis 8.95 mag. The stars are generally associated with\nbrighter X-ray sources: the sample median count rate\nis 0.04 counts s\u22121 . By contrast, the median for the 2520\nRASS sources is 0.03 counts s\u22121 . The median separation\nbetween RASS sources and SIMBAD stars is 12.0\u2032\u2032 ; this\nis equivalent to 0.9\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the separation between\nthe matched positions divided by the RASS positional\nuncertainty (see Figure 2). The offset distribution of the\nknown X-ray emitters in the sample suggests that the\nnumber of X-ray source counterparts drops quickly for\n> 30\u2032\u2032 or > 2\u03c3; only eight stars are at offsets\nseparations \u223c\n\u223c\n\u2032\u2032\n> 30 ; six have separations > 2\u03c3.\nThe optical brightness and small positional offsets\nof the previously unpublished RASS/SIMBAD matches\nstrongly suggest that they are also the X-ray sources.\nWe replicate the matching to the RASS BSC done by\nVoges et al. (1999) for stars in the Tycho catalog; the\nmatched stars are comparable in brightness to our SIMBAD stars (their median V \u223c 10 mag). For offsets < 30\u2032\u2032\nthe fraction of chance Tycho/RASS coincidences is \u223c 2%.\nThis implies that \u223c 248 of the 253 stars with offsets\n< 30\u2032\u2032 not yet associated with an X-ray source are likely\nRASS source counterparts.\nFigure 3 displays the RASS count rate vs. SIMBAD V\n13 These are FBS 0124\u2212098, NLTT 6782, FBS 0249\u2212084, and\nTYC 255\u2212263\u22121.\n\nFig. 3.- X-ray count rate vs. V for 139 known X-ray emitting\nSIMBAD stars and 249 SIMBAD stars offset by < 30\u2032\u2032 from a\nRASS source.

These are primarily F, G,\nK, and M stars, although there are a few candidate A\nstar counterparts (see the Appendix). There are also a\nhandful of WDs (including a WD/M-star binary) and of\nCVs, which stand out because of their relative optical\nfaintness but X-ray brightness. The brightest source is\nthe low-mass X-ray binary Hercules X-1, among the first\nextrasolar X-ray sources to be detected (Schreier et al.\n1972; Tananbaum et al. 1972).\n4.1.1. X-ray-to-optical flux ratio calculations\n\nNumerous studies have shown that there is a typical range of X-ray-to-optical flux ratios for each stellar type (e.g., Stocke et al. 1991; Krautter et al. 1999;\nZickgraf et al. 2003). Accordingly, we calculate log\n(fX /fV ) for our stars. We exclude the 23 stars listed in\nSIMBAD as belonging to luminosity classes II, III, or IV\n(see the Appendix). We also remove all stars for which\nthe RASS match has an X-ray flag set to 1, which indicates that the X-ray data are not reliable (see Voges et al.\n1999).\nWe do not remove the known binary systems from this\nsample when calculating the flux ratios. There are 64\nsuch systems within 30\u2032\u2032 of a RASS source and with\nRASS flags set to 0; one more is a known X-ray emitter\nwith an offset > 30\u2032\u2032 . 40 are listed in SIMBAD as double or multiple star systems; one is in a star cluster, and\none was identified as a binary through high-resolution\nspectroscopy by Metanomski et al. (1998). Seven of\nthese systems have been previously cataloged as X-ray\nsources. The sample also includes two Algol-type eclipsing and five spectroscopic binaries, four \u03b2 Lyr, six RS\nCVn, and six W UMa systems (including W UMa itself).\n14 20 known X-ray emitting stars lack a cataloged V , as do four\npreviously unidentified candidate RASS counterparts.\n\n\f6\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nFig. 4.- log (fX /fV ) distributions for the RASS/SIMBAD F, G, K, and M stars. The dashed histograms are the distributions for\nthe subsets of previously known X-ray emitters. The solid vertical lines correspond to the mean (fX /fV ) and the dot-dashed vertical\nlines bracket the 2\u03c3 (fX /fV ) range for each stellar type. The number of RASS/SIMBAD stars used to calculate these (fX /fV ) ranges\nis indicated in each panel; the number in parentheses is the subset of previously known X-ray emitters. The horizontal lines are (fX /fV )\nranges from the literature: the solid lines are from the Maccacaro et al. (1988) Einstein survey, while the dotted extensions are from\nKrautter et al. (1999).\n\nWhile these systems may seem unrepresentative, many\nare known X-ray emitters (e.g., all the W UMa and RS\nCVn systems, but also the Algol-type binaries), which\nargues for their inclusion in flux ratio calculations15 .\nAs part of the spectroscopic campaign described in\n\u00a7 4.2, we obtained spectra for 40 of the SIMBAD stars\nwith listed spectral types. Only 20 meet the criteria for\ninclusion in these calculations, and in only three cases\nwould using our APO-based spectral classifications affect\nthe (fX /fV ) distributions. In two cases, the difference\nin spectral type is consistent with our spectral typing\nuncertainty (see \u00a7 4.2): V* V842 Her, for which SIMBAD gives an F9V spectral type, and which we identify\nas a G2 star, and StKM 1 \u2212 1262, which Stephenson\n(1986) classifies as a K5 star, and which we find is an\nM0. In both cases, we use the SIMBAD type. The third\nstar is RX J1057.1 \u2212 0101, classified as a K4V star by\nZickgraf et al. (2005). We type the RASS counterpart as\na G5 star; however, examination of this error circle reveals that our APO target is not RX J1057.1 \u2212 0101 but\na nearby star. See the Appendix for further discussion\nof these stars.\nWe then have 105 known X-ray emitting F, G, K, and\nM stars with a cataloged V and with RASS flags = 0,\nand an additional 229 SIMBAD stars not previously associated with an X-ray source that meet the same criteria\nand are offset by < 30\u2032\u2032 from a RASS source. Following\n15 In practice, including the binaries broadens the flux ratio\ndistributions slightly by adding objects at higher (fX /fV ).\n\nMaccacaro et al. (1988), we calculate log (fX /fV ) = log\n(fX )+0.4V +5.37 and assume that on average 1 count s\u22121\ntranslates to fX = 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.1 \u2212 2.4\nkeV energy range (e.g., Motch et al. 1998; Voges et al.\n1999).\nWe first create separate distributions for the 105 known\nX-ray emitters and for the other 229 SIMBAD stars.\nKolmogorov-Smirnov tests of the resulting flux ratio distributions find that for F, G, and K stars the log (fX /fV )\ndistributions are drawn from different underlying distributions (P \u2248 0), while for the M stars the distributions\nare weakly related (P = 0.6; however, there are only six\npreviously unidentified candidate M star counterparts).\nThis is consistent with the fact that the known X-ray\nemitters are generally somewhat brighter in the optical\nand significantly brighter in the X ray than the SIMBAD stars not previously associated with a RASS source.\nGiven the high probability that based on positional coincidence the 229 previously unassociated stars considered\nhere are RASS sources, we group the known and previously unknown X-ray emitters together, and calculate\nlog (fX /fV ) for all of the stars of a given spectral type.\nThe resulting distributions are presented in Figure 4, as\nare empirical 2\u03c3 ranges estimated from the mean log\n(fX /fV ) for each spectral type.\nWe also show in Figure 4 the flux ratio limits for each\nclass as observed by Krautter et al. (1999); they identified 274 stellar X-ray emitters in an area-limited survey\nof RASS BSC and FSC sources.

Furthermore,\nthe flux ratio ranges calculated from our own distributions for these stellar types give us limits slightly more\ngenerous than the Einstein values (which are known to\nbe quite conservative; Stocke et al. 1991), but generally\nmore conservative than those of Krautter et al. (1999).\nTable 1 summarizes the properties of our sample of\nSIMBAD stars. We list the total number of stars of\neach spectral type in the initial sample, the number of\nknown X-ray emitters among them, and the number of\nnew X-ray source counterparts we identify based on the\ncombination of positional proximity and appropriate Xray-to-optical flux ratios.

For the A stars, WDs, and CVs, which\nare less numerous, we list the full range of flux ratios\nand their means. For the CVs, we give log (fX /fB ) (see\nZickgraf et al. 2003).\nBelow we touch on the properties of the CVs and WDs\nin this sample, and discuss our use of the F, G, K, and\nM stars to construct empirical log (fX /fJ ) ranges16 .\n4.1.2. The CVs and WDs\n\nTable 2 lists the matched RASS/SIMBAD CVs and\nWDs. All of the CVs are known X-ray emitters; only\nEI UMa does not have an SDSS spectrum. Szkody et al.\n(2002) and Schmidt et al. (2005b) identified FL Cet as a\npolar, where accretion from (typically) a late-type star\nis directly onto a WD's magnetic poles. The three other\nCVs are dwarf novae.\nSix of the eight WDs in Table 2 are listed as Xray sources by Fleming et al. (1996) while another, WD\n1520+525, was proposed as a soft X-ray source by\nChu et al. (2004). Seven of these WDs are DAs, stars\nwith pure hydrogen atmospheres that are the most commonly observed WD type. WD 1520+525 is the only\nnon-DA; its spectrum includes strong HeII features, making it a DO WD. Wachter et al.

While g or r would be a natural substitute for V , because many of these stars are\nsaturated, they have unreliable SDSS photometry. Instead, we use 2MASS J magnitudes; all of the stars in\nour sample have a 2MASS counterpart.\nTo calculate flux ratios, we adapt the Maccacaro et al.\n(1988) formula to reflect the definition of the 2MASS Jband flux (e.g., Cohen et al. 2003): log (fX /fJ ) = log\n(fX ) + 0.4J + 6.30. The SIMBAD stars included in our\n(fX /fJ ) calculations are either previously known X-ray\nemitters or newly identified RASS counterparts, as defined in \u00a7 4.1.1; in addition, we require that the J-band\nerrors \u2264 0.11 mag (for a discussion of the 2MASS flags,\nsee Cutri et al. 2003).\nAs mentioned above, a small number of these stars\nhave both a cataloged spectral type and one derived from\nan APO spectrum. In 24 cases, using either type has no\neffect on the (fX /fJ ) distributions; in 13 cases it does.\n11 of these stars were classified as \"F/G\" or \"K\" by\nZickgraf et al. (2003); these spectra are lower resolution\n17 A handful do: a few SIMBAD entries give a magnitude but no\nspectral class, for example. These stars are included in the APO\nspectroscopic sample discussed in \u00a7 4.2.\n\n\f8\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\nTABLE 2\nThe CVs and WDs among the RASS/SIMBAD matches\n\n1RXS J\n\nCounts s\u22121\n\nCounterpart\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nB\n(mag)\n\nV\n(mag)\n\nType\n\n015543.3+002817\n083821.6+483800\n085343.5+574846\n113826.8+032210\n020801.8+133625\n034850.1\u2212005823\n084104.2+032118\n112814.4\u2212024950\n152146.6+522215\n165008.0+370130\n165020.4+403723\n172642.8+583726\n\n0.042 \u00b1 0.012\n0.565 \u00b1 0.042\n0.414 \u00b1 0.035\n0.659 \u00b1 0.061\n0.054 \u00b1 0.016\n1.965 \u00b1 0.158\n1.207 \u00b1 0.065\n0.051 \u00b1 0.015\n0.168 \u00b1 0.016\n0.115 \u00b1 0.019\n0.094 \u00b1 0.016\n1.247 \u00b1 0.028\n\nV\u2217 FL Cet\nV\u2217 EI UMa\nV\u2217 BZ UMa\nV\u2217 T Leo\nWD 0205+133\nWD 0346\u2212011\nWD 0838+035\nWD 1125\u2212025\nWD 1520+525\nWD 1648+371\nWD 1648+407\nWD 1725+586\n\n9.9\n4.2\n8.0\n2.9\n24.7\n9.2\n5.1\n33.1\n11.6\n20.3\n3.9\n7.7\n\n16.60\n14.90\n15.30\n10.00\n13.78\n13.82\n***\n15.32\n15.56\n***\n***\n15.36\n\n15.50\n***\n***\n10.00\n***\n13.98\n14.48\n***\n16.60\n16.10\n14.50\n15.45\n\nP\nDN\nDN\nDN\nDA+dM1\nDA\nDA\nDA\nDO\nDA\nDA\nDA\n\nNote. - \"P\" indicates that CV is a polar and \"DN\" that it is a dwarf nova.\n\nFig. 5.- log (fX /fJ ) ratios for the RASS/SIMBAD F, G, K, and M stars.

The APO spectroscopic sample\n\nOur search for cataloged candidate counterparts identified \u223c 1400 RASS sources with no obvious counterparts\nin either SIMBAD or NED18 . The objects \u2264 30\u2032\u2032 from\na RASS source made up the list of primary targets for\nour spectroscopic campaign.

In our standard\nset-up, the DIS 'low' blue grating is centered on 4500 \u00c5\n(with a dispersion of 2.4 \u00c5 per pixel); its 'medium' red\ngrating is centered on 7600 \u00c5 (2.3 \u00c5 per pixel); we use\na 1.5\u2032\u2032 (3 pixel) slit. This results in wavelength coverage\nfrom 3800 to 8700 \u00c5 with a resolution of \u223c 700 in the\nblue and \u223c 1000 in the red. Almost all of our observing was done in bright time, and our integrations were\n< 5 min. The data were flux calibrated with\ntypically \u223c\nstandards taken each night. The spectra were reduced\nwith a script written in PyRAF, the Python-based command language for the Image Reduction and Analysis\nFacility (IRAF)19 . All spectra were trimmed, overscan\nand bias corrected, cleaned of cosmic rays, flat fielded,\nextracted, dispersion corrected, and flux calibrated using\nstandard IRAF tasks.\nIn most cases, a single observation was sufficient to\nobtain a spectral type for the candidate counterpart; we\nthus have 649 error circles with a unique spectrum. In\n107 error circles we took at least two spectra of the same\ntarget, generally because the target was relatively faint\n> 16) or the weather uncooperative, and the first spec(g \u223c\ntrum was of insufficient quality to allow for confident\ntyping. In an additional 98 RASS error circles we took\nspectra for more than one target, usually because of the\npresence of an apparent companion to our target. The\ntotal number of RASS sources considered is nearly 900 if\nwe include the 41 SIMBAD stars with cataloged spectral\ntypes for which we obtained APO spectra.\nTo obtain spectral types for our targets, we used the\nHammer (Covey et al. 2007). The Hammer automatically predicts the Morgan-Keenan (for stars earlier than\nM) or Kirkpatrick (for later stars) spectral type on the\nbasis of a fit to a set of 30 spectral indices20 . The\n19 PyRAF is a product of the Space Telescope Science Institute,\nwhich is operated by AURA for NASA. IRAF is distributed by the\nNational Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by\nthe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n20 The Hammer is written in IDL and is available from\n\nHammer also allows the user to interactively modify the\nassigned spectral type. Every spectrum was therefore\nchecked by eye before a final type was assigned.\nAs noted above, in 107 cases we obtained at least two\nspectra of a candidate RASS counterpart, generally because our first spectrum was fairly noisy. Nevertheless,\n80% of the time the stellar types assigned to a given\nstar agree to within two subclasses, which we take to\nbe our uncertainty. For those cases where the difference\nis larger, we assigned the spectral type obtained from\nfitting the highest signal-to-noise spectrum for that particular star.\nIn Figure 6 we present the positional offset and \u03c3 (as\ndefined earlier) distributions for stars in 751 of the 756\nRASS error circles where we selected only one target.\nFor these calculations, we updated the positional (and\nphotometric) data for the SDSS stars to the more recent\nData Release 6 (DR6; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008)\nvalues. Of the five objects not included, one is a QSO,\ntwo are stars whose spectra are too poor for confident\ntyping, and two others lack data in DR6 because they\nfall on the survey edges.\n646 of the 751 stars have separations \u2264 30\u2032\u2032 ; to these\nwe add two stars with separations > 30\u2032\u2032 previously identified as RASS counterparts by Zickgraf et al. (2003) but\nlacking a spectral type. Of these 648 stars, 645 are F, G,\nK, or M stars (two others were typed as A stars21 and\none is a CV). If we apply the same J-band quality cut\nas to our earlier sample (Jerr \u2264 0.11 mag), and remove\nobjects for which the RASS flag is not 0, we are left with\na sample of 616 stars: 70 F, 245 G, 166 K, and 132 M.\nThe log (fX /fJ ) distributions for these F, G, K,\nand M stars are plotted in Figure 7. We also include\nthe flux ratio means and 2\u03c3 ranges derived from the\nRASS/SIMBAD sample (see Table 1). We identify as\nspectroscopically confirmed counterparts to RASS X-ray\nsources objects with (fX /fJ ) within 2\u03c3 of the mean\n(fX /fJ ) value of optically bright X-ray emitters in the\nhttp://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\u223ckcovey/.\n21 Discussed in the Appendix.\n\n\f10\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nFig. 7.- log (fX /fJ ) ratios for the candidate SDSS counterparts with APO spectroscopy.

The number of SDSS/APO stars used to calculate these (fX /fJ ) ranges is indicated in each panel.\n\nsame spectral type range. These plots show clearly that\nthe probability that a spectroscopic target is a RASS\ncounterpart increases as we move to later spectral types.\nOnly 31 of the 70 spectroscopically identified F stars\nfall within the 2\u03c3 log (fX /fJ ) range derived from the\nRASS/SIMBAD F stars (44%); for the G stars, the fraction is 149 of 245 (61%). For K stars and M stars the\nfraction is much higher: 139 of 166 K stars (84%) and\n127 of 132 M stars (96%) have log (fX /fJ ) within their\nrespective 2\u03c3 ranges.\nThe X-ray, optical, and infrared properties of the 443\nnew F, G, K, and M X-ray emitters identified here are included in our final catalog22, described in \u00a7 5, along with\nthe 230 RASS/SIMBAD F, G, K, and M stars identified\nabove. Below we discuss the error circles for which we obtained multiple APO spectra, our candidate flare stars,\nand a new CV discovered in this spectroscopic campaign.\n4.2.1. The error circles with multiple spectra\n\nFor the error circles in which we have APO spectra for\nseveral targets, we calculated the positional separation\nand log (fX /fJ ) ratio and obtained a spectral type for\neach. The best candidate counterpart in each error circle\nwas then identified on the basis of its proximity (only\nstars \u2264 30\u2032\u2032 from a RASS source whose X-ray flag is 0\nwere considered) and the appropriateness of its (fX /fJ )\ngiven its spectral type. In 34 error circles we identified\n22 Note that this number reflects our removal of three stars (one\nG, one K, and one M) observed at APO from our final catalog based\non our comparison to the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) catalog. See\n\u00a7 5.2.\n\na single stellar counterpart (2 F, 11 G, 8 K, and 13 M\nstars); these are included in our final catalog.\nIn another 26 error circles, two stars met our criteria; in 14 of these cases our target has an apparent close\ncompanion (separations of \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 or less), making it difficult to avoid photometric uncertainties in the SDSS and\n2MASS catalogs and sometimes to obtain clean spectra\nwith our 1.5\u2032\u2032 slit. We list these error circles separately\nin Table 3. Higher resolution X-ray observations are required to determine which of the possible counterparts\nis in fact the X-ray source; it is also possible, of course,\nthat both stars are X-ray emitters.\n4.2.2. The candidate flare stars\n\nMany of the stars for which we obtained multiple spectra were M stars with what appeared to be stronger-thanaverage emission lines. Figure 8 shows the spectra for\nthe target with the largest number of observations, the\nproposed counterpart to 1RXS J080826.7+434745. The\ninitial spectrum suggested that we caught this M4 star\nflaring, and we returned to it regularly over the course of\nthe next two years. All of the spectra include the Balmer\nand CaII H & K emission lines typical of M star spectra. However, these features are much stronger in the\ninitial spectrum, as can be clearly seen in the bottom\npanel of Figure 8, where the spectra have been normalized to the value of their flux at 4600 \u00c5. In addition,\nan emission feature at 4471 \u00c5 is evident in the initial\nspectrum and absent in the quiescent spectra. During a\nflare, the amount of material emitting at chromospheric\ntemperatures increases, and lines due to high-excitation\nspecies such as HeI, which is responsible for this feature,\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\n\n11\n\nTABLE 3\nRASS sources with multiple candidate counterparts\n\n1RXS J\n\nCounts s\u22121\n\nSDSS J\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032

The blue continuum visible in the initial spectrum is also typically observed in\nflare events (e.g., Hawley & Pettersen 1991). In a forthcoming paper (E. Hilton et al., 2009, in preparation) we\ndescribe the properties of M stars for which we detected\nsimilar changes to the emission lines and continuum.\n4.2.3. A new CV: SDSS J171456.78+585128.3\n\nAPO spectra for the proposed counterpart to the RASS\nsource RXS J171456.2+585130 are presented in Figure 9.\nWe obtained six spectra for this star on five separate\nnights between 2005 Sep 14 and 2006 May 17 using DIS\n\nin the low-resolution setup. While the underlying spectrum corresponds to that of a K4 star, strong, persistent\nBalmer emission is obvious (see the top panel of Figure 9). The emission lines are broader than for the M\nstar in Figure 8, suggesting that we are observing accretion rather than flaring, and there is therefore a currently\ninvisible companion to the K4 star.\nOn 2007 Jul 16, we obtained three more spectra of this\nstar using DIS in the high-resolution setup (0.62 \u00c5 per\npixel in the blue, 0.56 \u00c5 in the red, with the gratings centered on 4600 and 6800 \u00c5 respectively). These spectra\nconfirmed that the emission lines are broader than those\n\n\f12\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nFig. 8.- APO spectra of the proposed stellar counterpart to\n1RXS J080826.7+434745.

Top: low-resolution spectra, presented\nas in Figure 8. Two spectra were obtained on 2006 Apr 16. Bottom:\nhigh-resolution spectra of the region including the H\u03b2, H\u03b3, and H\u03b4\nlines showing the structure typically seen in CVs.\n\nof flaring stars, and also more structured than those typically seen in flares or in symbiotic systems (see bottom\npanel of Figure 9). We used IRAF's splot routine to measure the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 equivalent widths (EqWs) in our two\nlongest observations (20 and 30 min). The average H\u03b1\nEqW = 12.5 \u00c5, corresponding to a flux of 9.5 \u00d7 10\u221214\nergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 ; for H\u03b2, the EqW = 10.0 \u00c5 and the flux\n= 7.0 \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 . We conclude that SDSS\nJ1714 is a new CV.\nTo measure its period, we used DIS in its new lowresolution setup (1.9 \u00c5 per pixel in the blue, 2.3 \u00c5 in the\nred, with the gratings centered on 4295 and 6600 \u00c5) to\nacquire a dozen 20-min spectra on 2007 Oct 07. Since\nthe secondary in this system is a K star, we expected the\norbital period to be long, on the order of 5 to 6 hours.\nIn fact, our radial velocity measurements suggest that\nthe period is \u223c 10 hours and further observations are\nrequired to determine SDSS J1714's period and nature.\nIts log (fX /fg ) of \u22121.44, while low, is consistent with it\nbeing a dwarf nova, as is its position in the log (fX /fg )\nvs. H\u03b2 EqW plot (see \u00a7 6.1.1).\n\nWe derive distances to the F, G, K, and M stars in our\ncatalog using photometric parallax relations appropriate\nfor dwarfs on the main sequence, since these dominate\nour sample. We construct B \u2212 Ks colors using the Tycho/USNO B magnitudes for 662 stars in the catalog\n(48 lack a B magnitude) and adopt the relationship between g \u2212 Ks and B \u2212 Ks derived by Covey et al. (2008).\nWe then use a fit to the MKs vs. g \u2212 Ks tabulations of\nKraus & Hillenbrand (2007) to derive distances to each\nstar. Adopting the same conversion of 1 count s\u22121 into\nfX = 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 used in \u00a7 4.1.1, we calculate\nX-ray luminosities for our stars.\nThese luminosities are shown in Figure 10 as a function of distance. We also plot data from several other\ncatalogs of X-ray emitters. The Schmitt & Liefke (2004)\nand H\u00fcnsch et al. (1999) catalogs are both of ROSAT\ndetections of nearby stars, and the luminosities are also\nover the 0.1 \u2212 2.4 keV range. We also include the 11\nX-ray emitting stars identified by Feigelson et al. (2004)\nin the Chandra Deep Field North and the 348 identified\nby Covey et al.

Also shown are the samples of\nSchmitt & Liefke (2004), H\u00fcnsch et al. (1999), Covey et al. (2008),\nand Feigelson et al. (2004).\n\nAs a test of the robustness of our identifications,\nwe queried the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) catalog for\nmatches to our own. They provide classifications for 115\nX-ray sources that appear in our catalog23. 100 have\ncounterparts that are classified as stars; while these are\ntherefore previously known sources, our work provides\nadditional information (e.g., spectral types) not available\nin the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) catalog.\nThe 15 other sources have counterparts identified by\nFlesch & Hardcastle (2004) as radio sources (six), galaxies (nine), or AGN/QSOs (three). However, in four of\nthese cases, Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) calculate that\ntheir catalog-level matching has most likely produced a\nrandom association between e.g., a radio source and an\noptical object. For five sources, inspection of the SDSS\ndata for the RASS error circles reveals that the position\nof the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) counterpart is that of\nour proposed stellar counterpart, or is offset but still\n23 In nine cases there are two entries in the Flesch & Hardcastle\n(2004) catalog for what appear to be different detections of the\nsame X-ray source.\n\nconsistent with being the star in our catalog (i.e., there\nis no SDSS object detected at the Flesch & Hardcastle\n(2004) position and the nearest object is the bright\nstar we identify as the source). The available SDSS\ndata indicate that the proposed AGN/QSOs are the\nRASS source counterparts, and we remove these three\nsources from our catalog. This leaves only three cases\nin which Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) propose a different\n(non-AGN) counterpart to the X-ray source.\nIn another 171 cases a source in our catalog is classified by Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) simply as an X-ray\nsource. They calculate that 39 of these entries most\nprobably have stellar counterparts and that for another\n50 sources their proposed association is most likely random. Inspection of the SDSS data for the remaining 82\nFlesch & Hardcastle (2004) RASS error circles finds that\nin 60 cases the counterpart's position is that of our cataloged star, or is offset but still consistent with being the\nstar in our catalog. For 149 of these 171 sources, therefore, the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) classification either\nagrees with or does not contradict our own.\nWe also checked our catalog for entries listed in the\nParejko et al. (2008) catalog of \u223c 1900 X-ray emitting\ngalaxies, constructed from matching the RASS to the socalled main galaxy sample from the SDSS Data Release\n4 (DR4; Adelman\u2013McCarthy et al. 2006). 30 sources in\nour catalog are listed as having an SDSS galaxy as the\nX-ray counterpart. This sample is dominated by unclassifiable galaxies (24), which Parejko et al. (2008) define\nas galaxies for which most or all of their chosen diagnostic emission lines have fluxes too weak to be measured,\nand for which most of the matches to the RASS are in\nfact random. Unsurprisingly, only two of these galaxies\nare quoted as having a more than 50% chance of being\nthe X-ray counterpart; 17 are less than 10% likely to be\nthe RASS source. Of the six remaining galaxies, only a\ntransition galaxy and a galaxy with unclassified emission,\nmeaning that its position in the standard BPT diagrams\n(Baldwin et al. 1981) shifts according to the line ratios\nbeing considered, have a more than 50% chance of being\nthe X-ray source counterpart.\nGiven this broad agreement between our classifications and those of both Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) and\nParejko et al. (2008) and the additional information provided by our catalog, we list all of the (non-AGN) sources\nthat appear in their catalogs and ours in our final catalog and note their Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) and/or\n\n\f14\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nParejko et al. (2008) classification.\n5.3. Available data\nThe full version of our catalog of 709 stars is available on-line only. Sample data and derived quantities\nare shown in Table 4. We give the RASS source name,\npositional error, and count rate, the SDSS counterpart's\nname, the offset between the X-ray and optical position,\nand the SDSS g and 2MASS J magnitudes. We caution that any SDSS photometry for objects brighter than\ng \u223c 14 is suspect, and should be used only once the objects' flags (included in the full on-line catalog) have been\nconsidered. We then provide the calculated log (fX /fJ ),\nthe synthetic MKs and corresponding distance for stars\nwith a cataloged B, and the resulting X-ray luminosity\nand associated error (assuming 1 count s\u22121 corresponds\nto fX = 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ).\nThe on-line catalog contains the complete SDSS\nand 2MASS photometry, and where relevant, SIMBAD\ndata or APO observation dates and derived spectral\ntypes, as well as classification information from the\nFlesch & Hardcastle (2004) or Parejko et al. (2008) catalog.\n5.4. Reliability of our identifications\nIn order to test the reliability of our identifications,\nwe replicate the test described in \u00a7 3 to estimate the\nprobability of false matches for the stars included in our\nfinal catalog. We shift the positions of our stars by a few\narcminutes and rematch the catalog to the RASS. This\nconsistently returns fewer than five matches, indicating\nthat the chance of a random association between a star\nin our catalog and a RASS source is under 1%.\nA more conservative estimate of the number of false\nidentifications in our catalog comes from our comparison to the Flesch & Hardcastle (2004) catalog discussed\nabove. There are roughly 300 X-ray sources listed in\nthat catalog for which we also provide identifications.\nFor \u223c 10% of those our classifications disagree, and we\ntake this to be an upper limit on the contamination rate\nof our catalog as a whole.\n6. USING SDSS SPECTROSCOPIC CATALOGS TO\nIDENTIFY X-RAY EMITTING...\n\n6.1. Cataclysmic Variables\n\nAs evidenced from their small numbers in our SIMBAD\nand APO sample of RASS counterparts, CVs and WDs\n(discussed in \u00a7 6.2) are both rarer types of stellar X-ray\nsources. In order to build up meaningful samples of these\nobjects, we use the full SDSS spectroscopic catalogs for\nour correlations with the RASS.\nThe properties of the 177 new CVs spectroscopically\nidentified in SDSS have been described by Szkody et al.\n(2002, 2003, 2004a, 2005, 2006, 2007); an additional 36\npreviously known CVs have been recovered in the survey data. 45 SDSS CVs have X-ray counterparts in the\nRASS; all but one have been published in the Szkody et\nal. papers (SDSS J100515.38+191107.9 will be included\nin the next catalog). Below we discuss the (fX /fopt ) distributions for the X-ray emitting CVs and reproduce the\nPatterson & Raymond (1985) log (fX /fopt ) vs. H\u03b2 EqW\nplot for the 46 for which we have spectra.\n\n6.1.1. Flux ratios and H\u03b2 equivalent widths\n\nWe calculate log (fX /fg ) for the 45 X-ray emitting SDSS CVs, for EI UMa, the only CV in our\nRASS/SIMBAD sample not included in the SDSS CV\ncatalogs, and for SDSS J1714, the CV discovered in\nour APO spectroscopic survey. While this distribution is fairly symmetric about the median (+0.38) (left\npanel, Figure 11), we find, as expected, an offset between the flux ratios for confirmed polars (median log\n(fX /fg ) = +0.99) and for dwarf novae (median log\n(fX /fg ) = +0.13) (right panel, Figure 11).\nPatterson & Raymond (1985) described a correlation\nbetween (fX /fV ) and the EqW of the H\u03b2 emission line,\na proxy for the CV's overall emission strength. In Figure 12 we plot these two quantities for our CV sample24 . The H\u03b2 EqWs are reported in Szkody et al. (2002,\n2003, 2004a, 2005, 2006, 2007) for all but two of these\nCVs (SDSS J083642.80+532838.1/SW UMa and SDSS\nJ100515.38+191107.9); in those cases (and that of our\nnew CV) we measured them using IRAF's splot routine.\nThe scatter around the (fX /fg ) predicted by the\nPatterson & Raymond (1985) relationship is comparable\nto that found in other studies (e.g., Richman 1996). However, there are clear departures from this relationship,\nwith the polars appearing to form a distinct population\nfrom the dwarf novae and other CVs. Furthermore, the\nSDSS CVs tend to have higher (fX /fopt ) ratio than those\nincluded in the earlier studies, where only a handful had\nlog (fX /fopt ) \u2265 0 (Richman 1996).\n6.1.2. Outliers\n\nSDSS J015543.40+002807.2 occupies an unusual position in Figure 12 for a polar because of its low Xray-to-optical flux ratio (log (fX /fg ) = \u22120.93). As\nnoted by Szkody et al. (2002), SDSS J0155 was significantly brighter when observed by SDSS than in its Digitized Sky Survey image. A change in brightness of a\nfew magnitudes\u2013typical for polars entering a phase of\nstronger accretion\u2013would be sufficient to explain the apparent inconsistency of this system's log (fX /fg ) relative to that of other polars. Follow-up observations\nby Woudt et al. (2004) and Schmidt et al. (2005b) confirmed the large changes in mass transfer rate in this\nsystem.\nThe spectrum of SDSS J205017.84\u2212053626.8 shows\nHeII emission, but initial follow-up observations of this\nCV could not confirm that this is a magnetic system\n(Szkody et al. 2003). Its log (fX /fg ) of +0.19 is similar\nto that of other intermediate polars (IPs) in our sample,\nbut SDSS J2050 has a period of 1.6 hr, much shorter\nthan is typical for IPs. Homer et al. (2006) determined\nthat this is an example of the most magnetized type of\nCV, a disk-less, stream-fed polar.\nSDSS J102026.53+530433.1, the dwarf nova KS UMa,\nhas an anomalously low H\u03b2 EqW relative to other DNe;\nthis is because its SDSS spectrum was taken during an\noutburst and is dominated by the accretion disk.\nThe spectrum of SDSS J204827.91+005008.9 is very\nunusual, with a hump apparent between 4000 and 5000\n\u00c5 and a typical M-dwarf continuum to the red of the\n24 The color-dependent difference between g and V is small: g =\nV + 0.05 for a low-redshift QSO with B \u2212 V = 0.3 (Fukugita et al.\n1996).\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\n\n15\n\nFig. 11.- Left panel: distribution of log (fX /fg ) for 47 SDSS CVs identified as RASS counterparts. Right panel: the same distribution\nfor the known dwarf novae (dashed histogram) and polars (solid histogram).\n\nfact be the RASS counterpart, this is a crowded field;\npointed X-ray observations are required to confirm that\nthis star, rather than SDSS J2048, is the RASS-detected\nX-ray source.\nFinally, when discovered, SDSS J084026.16+220446.6\ndid not appear to have strong HeII emission\n(Szkody et al. 2006), but its log (fX /fg ) and H\u03b2\nEqW are very similar to those of the known polar\nGG Leo. However, definitively classifying this system\nand many other SDSS CVs clearly requires more\nobservational data than are provided by the survey.\n\nFig. 12.- log (fX /fg ) vs. EqWs of the H\u03b2 line for the 46 Xray emitting SDSS CVs for which we have spectra. The predicted\n(fX /fg ) is from Patterson & Raymond (1985). The labeled objects\nare discussed in the text.\n\nhump (see Szkody et al. 2006). Follow-up observations\nby Schmidt et al. (2005a) led to the conclusion that this\nlow-accretion magnetic binary is possibly a pre-polar.\nThe X-ray luminosity derived for this CV is an order\nof magnitude greater than the LX for similar SDSS\nsystems, where the coronae of the late-type companion stars are thought to be responsible for the X-ray\nemission (Szkody et al. 2004b). Schmidt et al. (2005a)\nsuggested that this weakens the case for SDSS J2048\nas the ROSAT -detected X-ray source. Accordingly, on\n2005 Aug 29 we obtained a DIS low-resolution spectrum\nfor the most obvious potential X-ray counterpart in the\nRASS field, a bright nearby star (g = 14.43), which we\nthen typed using the Hammer. This late G star has a\n2MASS counterpart with J = 11.01; the resulting log\n(fX /fJ ) of \u22122.15 is within the typical G star range (see\nTable 1). While this suggests that the G star may in\n\n6.2. White Dwarfs\nWDs cool as they age, and the most commonly observed WDs, DAs, have an effective temperature (Tef f )\ndistribution that peaks at \u223c 104 K (e.g., Eisenstein et al.\n2006). At that temperature, one would not expect a typical DA to be a significant producer of thermal X rays.\nHowever, Shipman (1976) pointed out that the X rays\nproduced in the hotter interior of a DA should travel\nthrough its thin hydrogen atmosphere unabsorbed.\nThe consensus was that the RASS would include upwards of 5000 X-ray emitting DAs (e.g., Barstow 1989),\nbut to date the number found in the RASS is far smaller.\nFleming et al. (1996) searched 55, 000 RASS sources for\nthe super-soft sources (HR1 = \u22121 and HR2 \u2264 0), found\nonly 161 DAs, and concluded that 90% of DAs are opaque\nto X-ray emission. More recent RASS identification programs have added only a few dozen X-ray emitting WDs\nto this sample (e.g., Zickgraf et al. 2003).\nThe SDSS DR4 produced a catalog of 9309 spectroscopically confirmed WDs. \u223c 8000 of these are DAs\nand \u223c 6000 are new (Eisenstein et al. 2006). Correlating SDSS WD lists with the RASS does not add many\nnew WDs to the sample of known X-ray emitters (see the\nAppendix for details about our correlations). However,\namong these new X-ray emitters are three that, if confirmed, may be the coolest X-ray emitting DAs detected\n(see \u00a7 6.2.2), suggesting that these fainter SDSS X-ray\nemitting WDs, while small in number, may prove to be\nvery interesting. Below we summarize our results before discussing the DAs' X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and\n\n\f16\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\ntemperature distributions.\n6.2.1. New SDSS X-ray emitting white dwarfs\n\nWe list 17 new confident DA WD/RASS source associations in Table 5; this number includes three post-DR4\nWDs, described below, and four McCook & Sion (1999)\nDAs not previously identified as X-ray sources25 . Table 5 gives the relevant data for these DAs, including the\nMcCook & Sion (1999) catalog name if available.\nThree of these DAs are not included in the\nEisenstein et al. (2006) DR4 catalog:\nSDSS\nJ093921.83+264401.1,\nJ100543.92+304744.9,\nand\nJ143736.67+362213.4. We have therefore fitted the\nSDSS spectra using the WD models described in\nKleinman et al. (2004) to obtain estimates for their\nTef f and log g. Because of calibration problems with the\nSDSS spectrum, this fitting fails for SDSS J1437, and\nwe identify it as a DA based on visual inspection of the\nspectrum. For SDSS J0939, the fits yield that the star\nis a DA0.9 with log g = 7.9 and Tef f \u223c 59, 000 K; SDSS\nJ1005 is a DA0.8 with log g = 7.6 and Tef f \u223c 62, 000 K\n(see Figure 15).\nWe also identify ten DAs as less certain RASS counterparts and list them in Table 5 for reference. Follow-up\noptical and/or X-ray observations are required to confirm\nthese associations.\nWe further identify several WDs of other types as\nRASS counterparts. Among these are three DAs with\nM star companions, two DB WDs, which have heliumrich atmospheres, and a PG 1159 star, a pre-WD star\nshowing strong oxygen and carbon lines. We also identify two other non-DA WDs from our post-DR4 spectra\nas likely RASS sources. We list these objects in Table 6\nand discuss follow-up Chandra observations of the two\ncandidate X-ray emitting DBs in \u00a7 6.2.3.\n6.2.2. log (fX /fg ) and temperature distributions\n\nIn Figure 13 we plot the log (fX /fg ) distribution for\nthe 36 Fleming et al. (1996) X-ray emitting DA WDs\nwithin the SDSS footprint26 . The median log (fX /fg ) =\n\u22120.23, with the 2\u03c3 range being from \u22121.72 to +1.26.\nThe 20 WDs not cataloged in Fleming et al. (1996) that\nwe have confidently identified as X-ray emitters have flux\nratios that fall within this range. Although not included\nin this Figure, the 10 additional less certain X-ray emitting DAs listed in Table 5 also have flux ratio values\nwithin this range.\nIn Figure 14 we compare the temperature distribution for our X-ray emitting DAs to that of the 76\nFleming et al. (1996) DAs for which Marsh et al. (1997)\nobtained temperatures. We include 15 previously known\nand 12 new DAs for which the association with a RASS\nsource is most secure27 . Only three Fleming et al. (1996)\nDAs in our sample have Marsh et al. (1997) temperatures and are plotted twice: WD 1026+453, 1429+373,\n25 Our matching returned an additional 11 known X-ray emitting\nDAs; ten were identified by Fleming et al. (1996) or Zickgraf et al.\n(2003) or both; the other DA was reported as an X-ray emitter by\nChu et al. (2004).\n26 This includes the six WDs from Table 2 listed in the\nFleming et al. (1996) catalog. Of the eight WDs in that table, only\nthe last, WD 1725+586, has an SDSS spectrum. It is therefore the\nonly X-ray emitting WD identified in our earlier work included in\nthe rest of this analysis.\n27 One new DA, SDSS J1437, lacks a T\nef f , as mentioned above.\n\nFig. 13.- log (fX /fg ) distributions for X-ray emitting DA WDs.\nThe dashed histogram is for the 36 Fleming et al. (1996) DAs in\nthe SDSS footprint; the solid one is for the sample identified here\n(eight recovered Fleming et al. (1996) DAs are not included in the\nlatter histogram). The solid vertical line is the mean flux ratio,\nand the dot-dashed vertical lines bracket the 2\u03c3 ranges, for the\nFleming et al. (1996) sample.\n\nand 1725+5863. For these DAs, the difference between\nthe Eisenstein et al. (2006) and Marsh et al. (1997) Tef f\nare rather large (2700, 1900, and 8900 K), with the\nEisenstein et al. (2006) Tef f being greater in each case.\nDiscrepancies such as these have been noticed in comparisons between SDSS temperatures and those in the\nliterature, particularly for the hotter objects, with the\ndifferences reaching \u223c 10% at 50, 000 K (D. Eisenstein\n2006, private communication). Nevertheless, the temperature distributions for our sample of X-ray emitting DAs\n(median Tef f = 43, 100 K) and that of Fleming et al.\n(1996) are very similar.\nWe also plot the Tef f distribution for 7578\nEisenstein et al. (2006) DAs, normalized to the maximum of the Fleming et al. (1996) distribution. The separation between X-ray emitters and \"ordinary\" WDs is\nclear, with the Fleming et al. (1996) DAs having a median Tef f \u223c 39, 000 K, compared to 14, 000 K for the\nEisenstein et al. (2006) DAs. Interestingly, 1251 of the\nEisenstein et al. (2006) DAs are hotter than 22, 153 K,\nthe temperature of the coolest Fleming et al. (1996) DA.\nEven if, as suggested by Fleming et al. (1996), 90% of\nDAs are opaque to X rays, we would expect \u223c 125 of\nthese to be X-ray sources. If we include the uncertain\nWD/RASS associations, we have to date found roughly\nhalf that number. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the use of the Fleming et al. (1996)\nsuper-softness criterion is too restrictive at fainter X-ray\nfluxes, where the hardness ratios have larger errors. Alternatively, these sources may be too faint to be detected\nin the RASS. We plan to explore this question further.\nThree of our new X-ray emitting DAs are cooler\nthan the coolest Fleming et al. (1996) DA and below the minimum temperature theoretically needed\nfor X-ray emission from a DA. The three DAs,\nSDSS J101339.56+061529.5, J120432.67+581936.9, and\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\n\n17\n\nTABLE 5\nNew X-ray emitting SDSS DA WDs\n\nSDSS J\n\nTef f\n(K)\n\n1RXS J\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nCounts s\u22121\n\nlog\n(fX /fg )\n\n075106.51+301726.4\n082346.14+245345.6\n091215.43+011958.8\n093006.79+522803.3\n093608.90+382200.5\n093921.83+264401.1b\n095245.58+020938.9\n100543.92+304744.9b\n101339.56+061529.5\n113836.33+475509.8\n120432.67+581936.9\n125938.08+603900.0\n132629.58+571131.5\n143736.67+362213.4b\n145600.79+574150.7\n154448.25+455039.0\n163418.25+365827.1\n022618.60\u2212083049.3\n074859.06+215445.7\n093307.65+400637.9\n093456.44+023121.1\n103237.35+512857.9\n112740.90\u2212024638.7\n152349.89+041434.6\n165645.49+182437.7\n232658.89\u2212002339.9\n232659.23\u2212002348.0\n\n33158 \u00b1 65\n34521 \u00b1 47\n55691 \u00b1 1415\n36469 \u00b1 185\n37809 \u00b1 397\n59224 \u00b1 1253\n43114 \u00b1 443\n62299 \u00b1 1232\n14375 \u00b1 603\n50602 \u00b1 1169\n15725 \u00b1 545\n37640 \u00b1 225\n94382 \u00b1 5479\n***\n31500 \u00b1 79\n53109 \u00b1 1119\n10080 \u00b1 216\n9692 \u00b1 153\n29717 \u00b1 911\n9037 \u00b1 57\n20844 \u00b1 1009\n20983 \u00b1 585\n20784 \u00b1 206\n23852 \u00b1 542\n12460 \u00b1 638\n8081 \u00b1 83\n10622 \u00b1 47\n\n075107.4+301719\n082345.4+245344\n091215.5+012003\n093006.7+522752\n093609.6+382237\n093922.8+264404\n095244.6+020946\n100543.7+304809\n101340.6+061556\n113836.9+475459\n120428.0+581934\n125936.6+603910\n132634.4+571052\n143738.0+362237\n145605.0+574132\n154449.3+455035\n163421.8+365859\n022615.8\u2212083108\n074858.9+215458\n093305.6+400553\n093458.0+023151\n103236.8+512809\n112741.1\u2212024614\n152351.0+041356\n165643.7+182441\n232701.2\u2212002337\n232701.2\u2212002337\n\n13.7\n10.2\n4.8\n11.4\n37.4\n13.3\n16.6\n24.5\n30.6\n12.3\n36.9\n14.8\n55.7\n36.4\n38.6\n11.5\n53.0\n45.8\n12.5\n50.7\n37.9\n48.7\n24.9\n41.6\n25.8\n34.6\n31.3\n\n0.038 \u00b1 0.013\n0.039 \u00b1 0.014\n0.041 \u00b1 0.015\n0.039 \u00b1 0.013\n0.038 \u00b1 0.012\n0.044 \u00b1 0.013\n0.025 \u00b1 0.010\n0.046 \u00b1 0.016\n0.019 \u00b1 0.009\n0.046 \u00b1 0.015\n0.022 \u00b1 0.010\n0.039 \u00b1 0.012\n0.020 \u00b1 0.009\n0.029 \u00b1 0.009\n0.021 \u00b1 0.008\n0.046 \u00b1 0.011\n0.016 \u00b1 0.007\n0.033 \u00b1 0.011\n0.026 \u00b1 0.010\n0.035 \u00b1 0.011\n0.023 \u00b1 0.011\n0.016 \u00b1 0.007\n0.017 \u00b1 0.007\n0.059 \u00b1 0.020\n0.015 \u00b1 0.006\n0.018 \u00b1 0.009\n0.018 \u00b1 0.009\n\n\u22120.69a\n\u22120.81\n\u22120.01a\n\u22120.53\n+0.00\n\u22120.17\n\u22120.69\n\u22120.42\n+0.70\n+0.04\n+0.63\n\u22120.30\n+0.11\n\u22120.23\n\u22120.83\n\u22120.08\n+0.60\n+0.94\n+0.75\n+0.46\n+0.60\n+0.35\n\u22120.45\n+0.49\n+0.66\n+0.37\n\u22120.37\n\nMcCook &\nSion (1999)\n***\n***\nWD\n***\nWD\n***\nWD\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\nWD\n***\n***\nWD\n***\n***\nWD\n***\n***\nWD\n***\n***\n***\n\n0909+015\n0933+385\n0950+023\n\n1454+578\n0223\u2212087\n0932+027\n1521+044\n\nNote. - Above the line are highly secure RASS counterpart identifications; below it are tentative identifications\nrequiring further observations. SDSS J0936 is listed as a DQ WD by McCook & Sion (1999). However, the SDSS\nspectrum does not show the carbon absorption lines typical of DQs, and it seems that this is indeed a DA WD.\na g photometry is flagged in SDSS.\nb Post-DR4 WD.\n\nvations, given the low X-ray detection likelihoods of the\nRASS sources, are called for.\nOne of these DAs, SDSS J1634, was observed with\nXMM on 2008 Mar 11 (ObsId 0503550701). The X-ray\nbackground for these observations was very high; the onsource integration time was very short (2200 s rather\nthan the 8000 s requested) and only MOS data are available. As the MOS is not very sensitive at soft energies,\nthe non-detection of the WD in these data is neither surprising nor conclusive.\n6.2.3.

Furthermore, these RASS\nsources have low detection likelihoods; visual inspection\nof the RASS images suggests that both sources were\nmarginally detected. 5 ksec Chandra snapshots of SDSS\nJ0931 on 2008 Jan 16 (ObsId 8916) and J1532 on 2008\nJun 01(ObsId 8917) were therefore taken to locate the\nRASS source and test whether the DBs are in fact X-ray\nsources. Sources were identified using the Ciao routine\ndmextract.\nThere is no Chandra source at the position of the WD\nin either observation, nor do we appear to have detected\neither of the RASS sources. We discuss each observation\nbelow; we conclude that the RASS sources were either\nspurious or transient.\n\n\f18\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\nTABLE 6\nX-ray emitting SDSS non-DA WDs\n\nSDSS J\n\nTef f\n(K)\n\n1RXS J\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nCounts s\u22121\n\nlog\n(fX /fg )\n\nType\n\nMcCook &\nSion (1999)\n\n093122.86+362209.4\n153225.49+472700.9\n114635.23+001233.5\n114312.57+000926.6\n132725.72+505711.2b\n134100.03+602610.4\n141740.23+130148.7b\n223051.15+125706.8\n\n20496 \u00b1 1050\n17567 \u00b1 447\n100000 \u00b1 794a\n17596 \u00b1 607\n10848 \u00b1 112a\n46306 \u00b1 0\n36000 \u00b1 51\n21125 \u00b1 880\n\n093119.2+362223\n153221.7+472648\n114634.6+001238\n114313.8+000955\n132725.7+505713\n134101.0+602556\n141741.2+130206\n223051.6+125713\n\n46.4\n40.4\n10.7\n34.2\n2.0\n15.7\n22.5\n9.4\n\n0.017 \u00b1 0.008\n0.012 \u00b1 0.005\n0.091 \u00b1 0.020\n0.038 \u00b1 0.017\n0.047 \u00b1 0.012\n0.034 \u00b1 0.009\n0.032 \u00b1 0.012\n0.023 \u00b1 0.010\n\n+0.60\n+0.20\n\u22120.72\n+0.22\n+0.04\n\u22120.42\n\u22121.11\n+0.55\n\nDB\nDB\nPG 1159\nDA+dM6e\nDA+dM\nDA+dM3e\nDA+dM\nDA+dM4e\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\nWD 1325+512\n***\nWD 1415+132\n***\n\na Fit for T\nef f is unreliable.\nb Post-DR4 WD.\n\n\u2022 SDSS J0931 The closest source to the RASS position is a weekly detected (< 3\u03c3) optically faint\n(g = 22.1 mag) galaxy28 . Taking into account the\nphotometric errors, SDSS J093119.70 + 362202.4\n< 0.6, giving it the UV-excess typically\nhas u \u2212 g \u223c\nseen in SDSS QSOs (cf.

While it is offset by 22\u2032\u2032 from the\nRASS position, it seems unlikely that this is the\nRASS source, however, as its Chandra count rate\nis substantially less than that predicted from the\nRASS source count rate.\nWe note the serendipitous detection of the counterpart to the RASS source 1RXS J093210.1+363010.\nSDSS J093209.60 + 363002.5 is a relatively bright\n(g = 17.8 mag29 ) z = 0.15 early type galaxy lacking both the photometric UV-excess and the strong\nspectroscopic emission lines typically seen in AGN.\nThe likely counterpart to a FIRST source, this is\nplausibly an X-ray emitting BL Lac, as suggested\nby Plotkin et al. (2008), although it also has some\nsimilarities to e.g., CXOU J031238.9\u2212765134, an\nX-ray bright optically normal galaxy (XBONG;\nComastri et al. 2002).\n\u2022 SDSS J1532 The closest Chandra-detected source\ncorresponds to a faint SDSS object (g = 21.1 mag).\nWithin the photometric errors, SDSS J153244.22 +\n472405.2 has u \u2212 g < 0.6; its log (fX /fg ) of 0.8 is\nconsistent with this being an AGN or QSO. However, this object is over 4\u2032 from the RASS position\nand its Chandra count rate is significantly less than\nthat predicted based on the RASS source count\nrate.\n7. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have used photometric and spectroscopic data from\nSDSS to identify 709 stellar X-ray emitters detected in\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The majority of these are\noptically bright stars with coronal X-ray emission, and\nwere therefore not identified based on routine SDSS spec< 15 mag obtroscopy, which typically does not target \u223c\njects. Instead, we used SDSS imaging photometry, correlations with 2MASS and other catalogs, and spectroscopy\nfrom the APO 3.5-m telescope to identify these stellar Xray counterparts. Our sample of 707 X-ray emitting F,\n28\n\nStar/galaxy separation at these magnitudes is unreliable\n(Scranton et al. 2002)\n29 This is the Petrosian magnitude.\n\nG, K, and M stars characterized in this fashion is one\nof the largest X-ray selected samples of such stars. Our\ncatalog also includes a known WD, WD 1725+586, not\npreviously identified as an X-ray source, as well as a new\nX-ray emitting CV, SDSS J171456.78+585128.3, identified on the basis of follow-up APO observations. We\nestimate that our contamination rate by false matches\n< 10%.\nbetween a RASS source and a star is \u223c\nIn order to expand the sample of X-ray emitting\nWDs and CVs, we also matched the SDSS spectroscopic catalogs of these objects (i.e., Eisenstein et al.\n2006; Szkody et al. 2007) to the RASS. We identified 44\nof the SDSS CVs published to date as RASS sources;\nroughly half are SDSS discoveries, with the others being\npreviously known systems. We add a new X-ray emitting CV to this list; SDSS J1005+1911 is among the CVs\nspectroscopically identified since the last SDSS catalog\n(Szkody et al. 2007) and is a SDSS discovery.\nCorrelating the SDSS DR4 WD catalog of\nEisenstein et al. (2006) with the RASS does not\nyield very many new entries in the catalog of known\nX-ray emitting WDs. We identify 25 DA WDs included\nin Eisenstein et al. (2006) as RASS sources; 14 of\nthese are new identifications (e.g., not included in the\nFleming et al. (1996), Zickgraf et al. (2003), and/or\nChu et al. (2004) catalogs of X-ray emitting WDs).\nExamination of post-DR4 spectroscopy allows us to\nidentify three additional SDSS-discovered DAs as RASS\ncounterparts, but the total number of X-ray emitting\nWDs in SDSS remains small.\nThis dearth of new X-ray emitting WDs may be a result of the relative sensitivities of the two surveys. Stellar\ncounterparts to RASS sources tend to be very bright optically, and can be identified without requiring the depth\nof SDSS\u2013while the fainter WDs discovered by SDSS are\nunlikely to be bright enough in the X-ray regime to have\nRASS detections (e.g., because they are too distant).\nHowever, among the new RASS WDs are three that, if\nconfirmed, may be the coolest X-ray emitting DAs detected to date, suggesting that these fainter SDSS X-ray\nemitting WDs, while small in number, may prove to be\nvery interesting. In these cases, as in the cases of other,\nless certain WD/RASS associations we propose, followup X-ray and/or optical observations are necessary.\nWe thank the referee for comments that improved the\npaper.

A stars are not generally predicted to be X-ray emitters; an unseen, young,\nactive later-type companion is usually thought to be the\nsource for the observed X rays (c.f. discussion in G\u00fcdel\n2004). While we recover seven A stars that are previously known X-ray sources (from Stocke et al. 1991;\nSimon et al. 1995; Shaw et al. 1996; Appenzeller et al.\n1998; H\u00fcnsch et al. 1998b; Schr\u00f6der & Schmitt 2007), it\nis unlikely, therefore, that all the other matched A stars\n\n\f20\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nare X-ray sources. However, the available SDSS data do\nnot allow us to propose other counterparts to these Xray sources. Follow-up X-ray and/or optical observations\nare required to test whether they are in fact the RASS\nsources.\nIn addition, we identified two candidate A star counterparts to RASS sources in our APO spectroscopic campaign. In both cases, however, the A star seems unlikely to be the RASS source. TYC 3071 \u2212 1446 \u2212 1,\nlisted in SIMBAD without a spectral type, appears to\nbe in front of a cluster of galaxies that includes 2MASX\nJ16571256+3920176, identified as the RASS source RXS\nJ165711.6 + 392028.\nThe SDSS spectrum of SDSS J095220.07+531455.6,\n33.5\u2032\u2032 away from RXS J095223.8 + 531455, is that of\na z = 0.12 QSO. While the candidate stellar counterpart is closer (19.2\u2032\u2032 ), the RASS hardness ratios (HR1\n= \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.34; HR2 = \u22120.15 \u00b1 0.46) are consistent with\nthose commonly found for AGN (e.g., Voges et al. 1999),\nand it therefore seems most likely that the QSO is in fact\nthe RASS source.\nCOMPARISON OF SIMBAD AND APO STELLAR\nCLASSIFICATIONS\n\nIn Table 8 we list all the SIMBAD-cataloged candidate\nRASS counterparts with a spectral type for which we\nobtained an APO spectrum. For 27 stars the spectral\ntype derived from our spectrum either does not differ\nsignificantly from the SIMBAD type or is within the same\nspectral class. In these cases choosing one type or the\nother has no impact on the flux ratio calculations, since\ne.g., all F stars are binned together. In 15 of the 20\ncases where subtypes are available in SIMBAD, the DISderived and SIMBAD spectral classes agree to within two\nsubtypes. (The DIS spectra allow us to assign a subtype\nto seven other stars for which none was available.)\nFor another 14 stars, the choice of stellar type does\nimpact the flux ratio calculations. In nine cases the\nstar's type was derived by Zickgraf et al. (2003) from\nlow-resolution spectra; we consider our types, obtained\nfrom higher resolution spectra, to be more reliable. In\nthe five other cases, a stellar subtype is listed in SIMBAD; our DIS-derived spectral type agrees to within\nthree subtypes in four cases\u2013only slightly worse than\nwhat we consider our typical uncertainty when typing with the Hammer. The fourth case is that of\nthe counterpart to 1RXS J105706.3\u2212010109, identified by Appenzeller et al. (1998) as the K4V star RX\nJ1057.1\u22120101. Our APO target was a star offset by\n\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 from this one, explaining the discrepancy in spectral types.\n22 of these stars are previously identified X-ray sources;\nthree additional stars are listed in SIMBAD as RASS\ncounterparts, but the origin of these associations is unclear.\nSDSS WD/RASS IDENTIFICATIONS\nBUILDING THE SAMPLE OF X-RAY EMITTING DAS\n\nTable 5 lists our most confident SDSS DA/RASS\nassociations. We discuss how we obtained these and our\nless certain identifications. Ten of these less certain cases\nare also listed in Table 5; follow-up optical and/or X-ray\nobservations are required to confirm these identifications.\n\nDAs discovered before SDSS\nIn correlating the Eisenstein et al. (2006) catalog\nwith the RASS, we identified 22 DAs listed in the\nMcCook & Sion (1999) catalog with an X-ray source\nwithin 1\u2032 . We classified seven of these sources as unlikely X-ray emitting WDs. In four cases, a known QSO\nis in the RASS error circle and the X-ray source is not\nsuper-soft, which is consistent with the QSOs being the\nX-ray sources.\nIn three ambiguous cases, the sources are not supersoft and at large separations from the RASS source, but\nthe available SDSS data do not rule out the DAs as Xray sources. SDSS J022618.60\u2212083049.3 is in a RASS\nerror circle with two bright stars (g = 12.98 and 13.19).\nThe RASS source is not super-soft (HR1 = 0.22 \u00b1 0.36)\nand it is therefore unlikely that the WD is the X-ray\nsource. SDSS J093456.44+023121.1 is in a error circle with no obvious X-ray source counterparts. There\nis a very faint, red star closer to the RASS position\n(g = 21.35, r = 20.06), but were it the X-ray counterpart,\nits log (fX /fg ) would be much higher than typical for\nstars. The RASS source is not soft (HR1 = 0.36 \u00b1 0.52),\nso perhaps this is a QSO with stellar colors. Finally,\nSDSS J152349.89+041434.6 is in a error circle with SDSS\nJ152349.88+041400.8, a g = 17.71 galaxy. In these cases\nfollow-up spectroscopy is needed to reveal, for example,\nwhether this galaxy hosts an AGN. We consider these\nthree WDs to be less certain RASS counterparts and list\nthem as such in Table 5.\nOf the remaining 15 previously known DAs, we include\nin Table 5 the four that have not been identified as X-ray\nemitters (i.e., they are not in the Fleming et al. (1996),\nZickgraf et al. (2003), or Chu et al. (2004) catalogs) as\nnew identifications.\nSDSS DR4-discovered DAs\nOur SDSS/RASS correlations yielded a further 25\nSDSS-discovered DA WDs (i.e., not listed in the\nMcCook & Sion (1999) catalog) with an X-ray source\nwithin 1\u2032 . Five of these sources also have nearby cataloged QSOs and are not super-soft. In three other cases\nwe identify plausible non-WD counterparts to the RASS\nsources. A UV-excess source with u \u2212 g = 0.00 \u00b1 0.03 is\npositionally coincident with the RASS source for which\nSDSS J083300.12+272254.5 is proposed as a counterpart. Similarly, another UV-excess source (with u \u2212 g =\n0.24 \u00b1 0.13) is closer than SDSS J094437.72+493815.3 to\nthe RASS source for which the WD is the candidate counterpart. Finally, for SDSS J162814.59+363008.3 a very\nfaint UV-excess object (g = 21.45, u \u2212 g = 0.18 \u00b1 0.13)\nis positionally coincident with a FIRST radio source. In\nall three cases the RASS sources are not super-soft, and\nit seems likely that the UV-excess objects are QSOs and\nX-ray sources. Follow-up spectroscopy is required to confirm this, but we consider these DAs to be unlikely RASSsource counterparts.\nOf the 17 remaining DAs, there are seven cases in\nwhich inspection of the RASS error circle, combined with\nthe RASS source hardness ratio, suggests that the WD\nis probably not the X-ray source\u2013but does not provide\na strong alternate X-ray counterpart candidate. In all\nthese error circles spectroscopy of multiple objects or\nhigh spatial resolution X-ray observations are needed.\nWe consider these seven WDs to be less certain RASS\n\n\fX-RAY-EMITTING STARS IDENTIFIED FROM THE RASS/SDSS\n\n21\n\nTABLE 8\nSIMBAD stars with APO spectra\n\n1RXS J\n\nSDSS J\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\n002552.2\u2212095756\n010257.2\u2212095145\n012724.2\u2212093359\n020000.4+003216\n020144.5\u2212101743\n020221.0\u2212010715\n021042.8\u2212093817\n021559.9\u2212092913\n022839.4\u2212093550\n022942.6\u2212003026\n025150.0\u2212081338\n031114.2+010655\n101627.8\u2212005127\n103546.1+021559\n104743.9+652750\n115749.7+663406\n142049.4+604930\n144243.9\u2212003955\n152346.8\u2212004434\n153826.3+523407\n153912.0+554357\n165110.5+355500\n165445.3+423237\n170352.9+321147\n172142.4+620036\n172439.2+644054\n230240.3+003453\n074553.1+355818\n081546.8+460123\n091609.6+015320\n092023.1+021351\n101716.7+051145\n102547.0+033143\n105706.3\u2212010109\n110046.1+052307\n110804.1+052216\n143139.0+004732\n153709.0+531928\n160602.0+501124\n161022.6+450934\n171928.8+652227\n\n002550.97\u2212095740.0\n010257.42\u2212095140.5\n012723.80\u2212093409.1\n015959.78+003219.3\n020143.87\u2212101728.9\n020223.99\u2212010708.3\n021044.57\u2212093826.0\n021558.94\u2212092912.4\n022839.68\u2212093545.5\n022941.79\u2212003029.2\n025148.21\u2212081342.3\n031115.49+010630.8\n101626.93\u2212005139.4\n103546.90+021558.3\n104743.71+652736.0\n115749.80+663344.1\n142049.51+604934.9\n144244.40\u2212003955.4\n152346.11\u2212004424.8\n153826.38+523418.2f\n153912.04+554355.2\n165109.95+355507.2\n165445.04+423227.5\n170352.87+321146.2\n172142.60+620032.8\n172438.98+644052.5\n230241.41+003450.2\n074555.71+355836.0\n081548.99+460119.5\n091610.17+015308.8\n092023.40+021340.5\n101716.76+051149.8\n102545.64+033141.0\n105707.70\u2212010115.5\n110046.08+052304.6\n110803.94+052214.3\n143138.92+004731.4\n153709.43+531920.3\n160602.24+501113.0\n161022.24+450934.9\n171928.68+652229.7\n\n24.4\n8.8\n11.3\n9.8\n16.8\n45.4\n27.7\n14.1\n6.5\n12.5\n26.8\n31.4\n17.6\n12.1\n14.1\n21.9\n4.5\n7.6\n14.2\n11.3\n1.6\n9.5\n9.9\n0.9\n4.0\n2.0\n17.0\n36.5\n23.2\n14.1\n11.4\n4.4\n21.0\n21.9\n2.4\n2.9\n1.5\n9.0\n11.7\n3.8\n2.4\n\nSIMBAD\nname\nNLTT 1354\nHD 6204\nFBS 0124\u2212098\n[BHR2005] 284\nNLTT 6782\nBD\u221201 277\nNLTT 7231\nEUVE J0215\u221209.5a\nHD 15424\nBD\u221201 341a\nFBS 0249\u2212084\n[BHR2005] 344\nRX J1016.4\u22120051b\nRX 1035.7+0215b\nHD 93270\nGSC 04160\u221200286\nRX J1420.8+6049c\nBD\u221200 2862d\nTYC 5003 \u2212 309 \u2212 1e\nHD 234250\nHD 238488\nNLTT 43695\nRX J1654.7+4232c\nTYC 2594 \u2212 1478 \u2212 1a\nRX J1721.7+6200g\nTYC 4206 \u2212 1161 \u2212 1g\n[ZEH2003] RX J2302.6+0034\nHD 62547\n[ZEH2003] RX J0815.7+4601\n[ZEH2003] RX J0916.1+0153\n[ZEH2003] RX J0920.3+0213\n[ZEH2003] RX J1017.2+0511\n[ZEH2003] RX J1025.7+0331\nRX J1057.1\u22120101b,h\n[ZEH2003] RX J1100.7+0523\nRX J1108.0+0522c\nRX J1431.6+0047c\nStKM 1\u22121262\nV\u2217 V842 Her\nRX J1610.3+4509c\nRX J1719.4+6522g\n\n3c\n1c\n3c\n1c\n2c\n2c\n1c\n\nOffset\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nPublished\nType\n\nFirst APO\nObservation\n\nAPO\nType\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.4\n0.3\n0.4\n0.0\n2.5\n0.3\n1.0\n0.3\n0.2\n2.4\n1.1\n0.3\n0.3\n3.9\n0.3\n1.7\n1.7\n0.4\n0.2\n0.1\n0.6\n4.0\n0.1\n1.3\n2.4\n3.2\n3.4\n0.5\n1.0\n0.7\n3.4\n1.5\n2.9\n2.7\n2.7\n0.3\n4.9\n2.4\n\nM3\nG0\nM3...\nM3.5V\nM3...\nK0\nM4\nMe\nF8\nG\nM5...\nM5.5V\nM0e\nM2e\nF8\nM\nM\nG5V+K1V\nKe\nK2\nF8\nM4\nM\nM2.5\nK4\nG0\nK\nK0\nF/G\nK\nF/G\nF/G\nF/G\nK4V\nK\nF/G\nK\nK5\nF9V\nK\nK0\n\n2003 Sep 03\n2003 Sep 03\n2003 Nov 08\n2003 Nov 16\n2003 Nov 08\n2005 Nov 20\n2003 Nov 08\n2004 Oct 04\n2005 Jan 05\n2003 Sep 03\n2004 Oct 04\n2005 Nov 20\n2004 Dec 03\n2004 Dec 03\n2005 Jan 29\n2004 Dec 03\n2004 Apr 30\n2005 Mar 01\n2005 Mar 30\n2005 Apr 26\n2005 Apr 26\n2005 May 31\n2005 May 31\n2005 Jul 19\n2005 Sep 14\n2005 Jul 20\n2005 Nov 09\n2005 Jan 05\n2005 Jan 29\n2005 Jan 29\n2005 Jan 29\n2005 Jan 29\n2004 Mar 28\n2004 Dec 03\n2004 Mar 28\n2004 Mar 28\n2005 Mar 01\n2005 Feb 26\n2005 Apr 26\n2004 May 22\n2005 May 31\n\nM4\nG3\nM3\nM3\nM4\nK3\nM3\nM3\nF2\nG8\nM4\nM6\nM1\nM3\nF7\nM4\nM3\nG2\nK1e\nK3\nF8\nM5\nM3\nM3\nK2\nG7\nK7e\nG7\nM2\nM4\nK7e\nG5\nG2\nG5\nM3\nM0\nM0\nM0\nG2\nM0\nG7\n\nNote. - The first offset is between the RASS and SDSS positions; the second is between the SDSS and SIMBAD positions.

Once again we eliminate those WDs in error\ncircles with cataloged QSOs; there are three such error\ncircles here, all with RASS sources that are not supersoft. For two other RASS sources the SDSS data suggest\nother counterparts. SDSS J123337.71+570335.4 is a z\n= 0.351 redshift QSO nearer to the RASS source (HR1\n= 0.20 \u00b1 0.42) than SDSS J123345.52+570343.9, a DB\nWD. The UV-excess object SDSS J155209.12+433821.8\n(u \u2212 g = 0.45 \u00b1 0.04) is also closer to the RASS source\n(HR1 = \u22120.18 \u00b1 0.37) than SDSS J155205.59+433825.8,\n\none of the DA+M-star binaries. While spectroscopic confirmation is needed in the latter case, we conclude that\nboth of these RASS sources are QSOs.\nThe six remaining WDs are the likely RASS sources\nlisted in Table 6. In addition to the two DBs discussed\nin \u00a7 6.2.3, these objects include the previously known PG\n1159 star SDSS J114635.23+001233.5. The spectrum for\nthis (very hot) star is poorly fit by our models, and the\nvalue for Tef f in Table 6 should therefore not be trusted.\nThe five other stars are DA+M-star systems, of which\none is an SDSS discovery, SDSS J223051.15+125706.8\n(Silvestri et al. 2006). For the three systems included\nin the Silvestri et al. (2006) DR4 catalog of close binary systems, we give the published Tef f and note\nthe M stars' spectral types. For the two other systems, SDSS J132725.72+505711.0 (WD 1325+512) and\n\n\f22\n\nAG\u00dcEROS ET AL.\n\nJ141740.22+130148.5 (WD 1415+132), we fit the spectra\nto obtain Tef f (listed in Table 6) and log g (8.93 \u00b1 0.09\nand 7.19 \u00b1 0.02, respectively). The fit to the spectrum\nof SDSS J1327 is poor; the spectrum has relatively low\nsignal-to-noise, and the presence of the M dwarf appears\nto have corrupted the fit to the H\u03b1 line.\nBUILDING A SAMPLE OF X-RAY EMITTING WDS\nIDENTIFIED SINCE DR4\n\nSince the production of the Eisenstein et al. (2006)\nWD catalog, new WDs have been identified through inspection of the more recent SDSS spectroscopy. We have\nalso collected a few objects whose spectra were taken\nearlier in the survey but that were not included in the\nKleinman et al. (2004) DR1 or Eisenstein et al. (2006)\nsamples; we refer to all of these objects as post-DR4.\nAmong the 43 RASS sources with new candidate\nWDs within 1\u2032 , we selected the super-soft sources (HR1\n\u2264 \u22120.8). Ten sources met this criterion. Two are\nknown DA WDs, WD 1325+512 and WD 1415+132\n(McCook & Sion 1999), and known X-ray emitters30 .\nThe SDSS spectra indicate that both have M-star companions, and we include these WDs in Table 6.\nIn two other cases, the SDSS data indicate that another object may be the RASS counterpart. For SDSS\nJ114142.84+143356.5, a g = 15.76 star is nearer to the\n30 WD 1415+132 is included in Fleming et al. (1996); WD\n1325+512 is listed in SIMBAD as a known X-ray source, but is\nnot included in Fleming et al. (1996) or Zickgraf et al. (2003). It\n\nposition of the RASS source (1RXS J14145.3+143349).\nThis star, were it to be the X-ray source counterpart,\nwould have log (fX /fg ) = \u22121.04, which is high for\na main sequence stellar X-ray emitter. On the other\nhand, this is the least soft of the RASS sources (HR1\n= \u22120.88 \u00b1 0.20). For SDSS J155109.55+454252.2, a\nUV-excess object (g = 17.55, u \u2212 g = \u22120.39 \u00b1 0.03)\nis virtually coincident with the RASS source (1RXS\nJ155108.6+454312). Since the RASS source is supersoft, this UV-excess object may be a WD or a CV; the\nlatter are also frequently super-soft emitters.\nIn the remaining six cases the association of RASS\nsource and SDSS candidate WD is very strong. Fitting the SDSS spectra using WD models then reveals\nthat three of these candidate WDs are in fact hot stars:\nSDSS J125338.50+051542.1, J133024.24\u2212001636.8, and\nJ161614.02+080905.8.\nThe other three stars are new DA WDs and\nincluded in Table 5: SDSS J093921.83+264401.1,\nJ100543.92+304744.9, and J143736.67+362213.4. Because of calibration problems with the SDSS data, the\nfitting failed to return values for Tef f and log g for the\nspectrum of SDSS J143736.67+362213.4 (the spectrum\nis also truncated at 7400 \u00c5). The fits for the two other\nDAs are shown in Figure 15.\nis unclear how it was identified as a RASS source.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbazajian, K., et al. 2003, AJ, 126, 2081\nAdelman\u2013McCarthy, J.

Top panels: fit\ncontours as a function of the DA subtype, with subtype being Tef f expressed in units of 50, 400 K/Tef f (Sion et al. 1983). The likelihood\ncontours are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 \u03c3. Bottom panels: closeups of the fit plotted with the spectrum. The dashed line is the fit without reddening;\nthe solid line is the fit with reddening taken into account.\nMaccacaro, T., et al. 1988, ApJ, 326, 680\nMarsh, M.
