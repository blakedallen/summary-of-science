Introduction\nA finite k-regular graph X, k \u2208 N, is called an \u03b5-expander (0 < \u03b5 \u2208\nR), if for every subset of vertices A of X, with |A| \u2264 21 |X|, |\u2202A| \u2265 \u03b5|A|\nwhere \u2202A = {y \u2208 X| distance (y, A) = 1}.\nThe main goal of this paper is to prove:\nTheorem 1.1. There exist k \u2208 N and 0 < \u03b5 \u2208 R, such that if G is\na finite simple group of Lie type, but not a Suzuki group, then G has\na set of k generators S for which the Cayley graph Cay(G; S) is an\n\u03b5-expander.\nFor short, we will say that these groups are uniform expanders or\nexpanders uniformly.\nTheorem 1.1 is new only for groups of small Lie rank: In [K1], Kassabov proved that the family of groups\n{SLn (q)|3 \u2264 n \u2208 N, q a prime power }\nare uniform expanders. Nikolov [N] proved that every classical group\nis a bounded product of SLn (q)'s (with possible n = 2, but the proof\nshows that if the Lie rank is sufficiently high, say \u2265 14, one can use\nSLn (q) with n \u2265 3). Bounded product of expander groups are uniform\nexpanders. Thus together, their results cover all classical groups of\nhigh rank. So, our Theorem is new for classical groups of small ranks\nas well as for the families of exceptional groups of Lie type.\nTheorem 1.1 gives the last step of the result conjectured in [BKL]\nand announced in [KLN]:\nTheorem 1.2 ([KLN]). All non-abelian finite simple groups, with the\npossible exception of the Suzuki groups, are uniform expanders.\nBy the classification of the finite simple groups, Theorem 1.1 covers all the simple groups except of finitely many sporadic groups (for\nwhich the theorem is trivial) and the alternating groups. The fact that\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nTheorem 1.2 holds for the alternating and the symmetric groups is a\nremarkable result of Kassabov [K2].\nThe main new family covered by our method is {P SL2(q)|q prime power }.\nUnlike the result mentioned previously whose proof used ingenious, but\nrelatively elementary methods, the proof for P SL2 (q) will use some\ndeep results from the theory of automorphic forms. In particular, it\n3\nTheorem ([Se], see also [Lu, Chap. 4])\nwill appeal to Selberg \u03bb1 \u2265 16\nand Drinfeld solution to the characteristic p Ramanujan conjecture (\n[Dr]).\nFor its importance, let us single it out as:\nTheorem 1.3. The family {P SL2 (q)|q prime power} forms a family\nof uniform expanders.\nLet us mention right away that Theorem 1.3 was known before for\nseveral subfamilies; e.g. for {P SL2 (p)|p prime} (see [Lu, Chap. 4] ] or\n{P SL2 (pr )|p a fixed prime and r \u2208 N} ( [Mo]). The main novelty is to\nmake them expanders uniformly for all p and all r. To this end we will\nuse the representation theoretic reformulation of the expanding property (see \u00a72) as well as the new explicit constructions of Ramanujan\ngraphs in [LSV2] as special cases of Ramanujan complexes. We stress\nthat the explicit construction there is crucial for our method and not\nonly the theoretical construction of [LSV1]. This will be shown in \u00a73.\nThe case of SL2 is a key step for the other groups of Lie type: A\nresult of Hadad ([H1], which is heavily influenced by Kassabov [K1])\nenables one to deduce SLn (n \u2265 2) from SL2 . Then in \u00a74, we use a\nmodel theoretic argument to show that simple groups of Lie type of\nbounded rank (including the exceptional families except of the Suzuki\ngroups) are bounded products of SL2 's. Together with Nikolov's result\nmentioned above, Theorem 1.1 is then fully deduced.\nThe Suzuki groups have to be excluded as they do not contain a copy\nof (P )SL2 (q) for any q, but we believe Theorem 1.2 holds for them as\nwell.\nAcknowledgment: The author is indebted to E. Hrushovski, Y. Shalom\nand U. Vishne for their useful advice, and to the NSF, ERC and BSF\n(US-Israel) for their support.\n2. Representation theoretic reformulation\nIt is well known (cf. [Lu, Chap. 4]) that expanding properties of\nCayley graphs Cay(G; S) can be reformulated in the language of the\n\n\fFINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS\n\n3\n\nrepresentation theory of G. For our purpose we will need to consider\nalso cases for which S is not of bounded size, in spite of the fact that our\nfinal result deals with bounded S. We therefore need a small extension\nof some standard results, for which we need some notation:\nThe normalized adjacency matrix of a connected k-regular graph X\nis defined to be \u25b3 = k1 A where A is the adjacency matrix of X. The\neigenvalues of \u25b3 are in the interval [\u22121, 1]. The largest eigenvalue in\nabsolute value in (\u22121, 1) is denoted \u03bb(X).\nFor a group G, a set of generators S and \u03b1 > 0, we denote by\nI(\u03b1, G, S) the statement:\nFor every unitary representation (V, \u03c1) of G, every v \u2208 V and every\n0 < \u03b4 \u2208 R, if k\u03c1(s)v \u2212 vk < \u03b4 for each s \u2208 S, then k\u03c1(g)v \u2212 vk < \u03b1\u03b4\nfor every g \u2208 G, (i.e., a vector v which is \"S-almost invariant\" is also\n\"G-almost invariant\".)\nNote that the statement I(\u03b1, G, S) refers to all the unitary representations of G, wherever they have invariant vectors or not.\nProposition 2.1. (i) For every \u03b1 > 0 there is \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u03b1) > 0 such that\nif G is a finite group, S a set of generators and I(\u03b1, G, S) holds, then\nCay(G, S) is \u03b5-expander.\n(ii) For every \u03b7 > 0, there exists \u03b1 = \u03b1(\u03b7) such that if G is a finite\ngroup with a set of generators S, and \u03bb(Cay(G, S)) < 1 \u2212 \u03b7, then\nI(\u03b1, G, S) holds.\n(iii) If k = |S| is bounded then the implications in (i)(a) can be reversed.\n(So Cay(G, S) is expander iff every \"S-almost invariant\" vector is also\n\"G-almost invariant\".)\nProof. We note first that property I(\u03b1, G, S) implies that there exists\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(\u03b1) > 0, such that for every unitary representation (V, \u03c1) of G\nwithout a non-zero invariant vector, and every v \u2208 V with kvk = 1,\n1\nand so if k\u03c1(s)v \u2212\nk\u03c1(s)v \u2212 vk \u2265 \u03b2 for some s \u2208 S. Indeed, take \u03b2 < 2\u03b1\nvk < \u03b2 for every s \u2208 S, then I(\u03b1, G, S) implies that k\u03c1(g)v \u2212 vk < 21\nP\n1\nfor every g \u2208 G. This implies that v = |G|\n\u03c1(g)v which is clearly a\ng\u2208G\n\nG-invariant vector, is non-zero since kv \u2212 vk < 21 . This contradicts our\nassumption that V does not contain an invariant vector.\nAltogether, I(\u03b1, G, S) implies the usual \"property T \" formulation\nand so the standard proof of Proposition 3.3.1 of [Lu] applies to deduce that Cay(G, S) is an \u03b5-expander for some \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u03b2(\u03b1)). This\nproves (i). The proof of (ii) is also a small modification of the standard\n\n\f4\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nequivalences (see [Lu, Theorem 4.3.2]): As it is well known, a normalized eigenvalue gap (i.e. \u03bb(Cay(G, S)) < 1 \u2212 \u03b7) implies an \"average\nexpanding\", i.e. if (V, \u03c1) does not contain an invariant vector, then\n1 X\nk\u03c1(s)v \u2212 vk \u2265 \u03b7 \u2032 kvk\n(\u2217)\n|S| s\u2208S\n(where \u03b7 \u2032 depends only on \u03b7). Note, that when S is unbounded, this is\na stronger property than \"expanding\" which gives that for one s \u2208 S,\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nk\u03c1(s)v \u2212 vk \u2265 \u03b7 kvk (for \u03b7 = \u03b7 (\u03b7)). Now, assume (V, \u03c1) is an\narbitrary unitary representation space of G and v \u2208 V , of norm one,\nis \u03b4-invariant under S for some \u03b4 < \u03b7 \u2032 . Then (\u2217) implies that a large\nportion of v is in the space V G of G-fixed points. Hence v is G-almost\ninvariant as needed.\nPart (iii) is just the standard equivalences as in [Lu, Theorem 4.3.2].\n\u0003\nAn easy corollary of Proposition 2.1 is that 'bounded products of\nexpanders are expanders' or in a precise form:\nCorollary 2.2. Let G be a finite group and Gi , i = 1, . . . , l a family\nof subgroups of G, each comes with a set of generators Si \u2286 Gi , i =\n1, . . . , l, with |Si | \u2264 r. Assume G = G1 * . . . * Gl , i.e., every g \u2208 G\ncan be written as g = g1 g2 . . . gl , with gi \u2208 Gi . If all Cay(Gi ; Si ) are\nl\nS\n\u03b4-expanders, then Cay(G; S) is \u03b5-expander for S =\nSi and \u03b5 which\ndepends only on \u03b4 and l.\n\ni=1\n\nProof. If (V, \u03c1) is a unitary representation of G, and v \u2208 V is a vector\nwhich is almost invariant under S, then it is almost invariant under each\nof the subgroups Gi (by (2.1)(iii)) and as G is a product of them, it is\nalso almost invariant by G. Now use (2.1)(i) to deduce the Corollary.\n\u0003\nLet us mention here another fact that will be used freely later. The\nfollowing Proposition is a special case of a more general result in [H2]:\nProposition 2.3. Let {Gi }i\u2208I be a family of perfect finite groups (i.e.\n[Gi , Gi ] = Gi ) with sets of generators Si . Assume \u03c0i : G\u0303i \u2192 Gi is a\ncentral perfect cover of Gi and S\u0303i \u2282 G\u0303i a subset for which \u03c0(S\u0303i ) = Si .\nIf Cay(Gi , Si ) are uniformly expanders, then so are Cay(G\u0303i , S\u0303i ).\nThe Proposition shows that proving uniform expanding for finite\nsimple groups or for their central extensions is the same problem. So\na family of groups of the form P SLd (q) are expanders iff SLd (q) are.\n\n\fFINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS\n\n5\n\n3. SL2 : Proof of Theorem 1.3\nThe goal of this section is to show that all the groups {SL2 (q)|q prime power }\n(and hence also P SL2 (q)) are uniformly expanders. Let us recall\nTheorem 3.1. \u001aThe Cayley\ngraphs \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u001b\n1 1\n0 1\n), for p prime, are 3Cay(P SL2(p); A =\n, B=\n0 1\n\u22121 0\nregular uniform expanders.\nFor a proof, see [Lu, Theorem 4.4.2]. The proof uses Selberg The3\norem \u03bb1 (\u0393(m)/H2 ) \u2265 16\n- giving a bound on the eigenvalues of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator of the congruence modular surfaces. For a\nnew method see [BG].\nAnother preliminary result needed is:\nTheorem 3.2. (a) For a fixed prime p, the groups SL2 (pk ), k \u2208 N\nhave a symmetric subset Sp of p + 1 generators for which the Cayley\nk\ngraphs X = Cay(SL\n2 (p ), Sp ) are (p + 1)-regular Ramanujan graphs,\n\u221a\n2 p\ni.e. \u03bb(X) \u2264 p+1 .\n(b) The set of generators Sp in part (a) can be chosen to be of the\nform {h\u22121 Ch | h \u2208 H}, where C is some element of SL2 (pk ) and H is\na fixed non-split torus of GL2 (p). (The proof will give a more detailed\ndescription of Sp ).\nBefore proving Theorem 3.2, let us mention that part (a) has already\nbeen proven by Morgenstern [Mo], but the specific form of the generators as in (b) is crucial for our needs. We therefore apply to [LSV2]\ninstead of [Mo]. We recall the construction there: Let Fq be the field\nof order q (a prime power), Fqd the extension of dimension d and \u03c6 a\ngenerator of the Galois group Gal(Fqd /Fq ). Fix a basis {\u03be0 , . . . , \u03bed\u22121 }\nfor Fqd over Fq where \u03bei = \u03c6i (\u03be0 ). Extend \u03c6 to an automorphism of\nthe function field k1 = Fqd (y) by setting \u03c6(y) = y; the fixed subfield is\nk = Fq (y), of codimension d.\nFollowing the notation in [LSV2], we will denote by RT the ring\n1\n] and for every commutative RT -algebra (with unit) S, we\nFq [y, 1+y\ndenote by y the element y * 1 \u2208 S. For such S one defines an S-algebra\nd\u22121\n\nA(S) = \u2295 S\u03bei z j with the relations z\u03bei = \u03c6(\u03bei )z and z d = 1 + y. Let\ni,j=0\n\n1\nR = Fq [y, y1 , 1+y\n] \u2286 k and denote b = 1 + z \u22121 \u2208 A(R). For every\nu \u2208 F\u2217qd \u2282 A(R)\u2217 , we denote bu = ubu\u22121 . As F\u2217q is in the center of\nd\n\n\u22121\nA(R), bu depends on the coset of u in F\u2217qd /F\u2217q . This gives qq\u22121\nelements\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n{bu |u \u2208 Fqd /Fq } of A(R) . The subgroup of A(R) generated by the\n\n\f6\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nbu 's is denoted \u0393\u0303 and its image in A(R)\u2217 /R\u2217 by \u0393 = \u0393d,q . For every\nideal I \u22b3 R, we get a map\n\u03c0I : A(R)\u2217 /R\u2217 \u2192 A(R/I)\u2217 /(R/I)\u2217.\nThe intersection \u0393 \u2229 Ker\u03c0I is denoted \u0393(I).\nTheorem 6.2 of [LSV2] says:\nTheorem 3.3. For every d \u2265 2 and every 0 6= I \u22b3 R, the Cayley\ncomplex of \u0393/\u0393(I) is a Ramanujan complex.\nThe reader is referred to [LSV1] and [LSV2] for the precise definition\nof Ramanujan complex and for the precise complex structure of \u0393/\u0393(I).\nWhat is relevant for us here is that this gives a spectral gap on the\nd \u22121\ngenerators S = {bu |u \u2208\nCayley graph of \u0393/\u0393(I) with respect to the qq\u22121\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFqd /Fq }.\nWhen d = 2, S is a symmetric set of generators of \u0393 and so Cay(\u0393/\u0393(I); S)\nis a k = (q + 1)-regular graph. When d \u2265 3, S \u2229 S \u22121 = \u2205 and\nd \u22121)\n-regular graph. Let A be its adjacency\nCay(\u0393/\u0393(I); S) is a k = 2(qq\u22121\n1\nmatrix and \u2206 = k A the normalized one. Theorem 3.3 implies:\nCorollary 3.4. Denote by \u03bcd -the roots of unity in C of degree d and\n|y \u2208 \u03bcd }. Let \u03bb be an eigenvalue of \u2206. Then either \u03bb \u2208 Ed\nEd = { y+\u0233\n2\ndq (d\u22121)/2\nor |\u03bb| \u2264 (qd \u22121)/(q\u22121) .\nRemark 3.5. Note that when d = 2, k = |S| = q + 1, Ed = {\u00b11}\nand Corollary 3.4 states that Cay(\u0393/\u0393(I); S) are Ramanujan graphs.\nThe proof of this bound for d = 2 requires Drinfeld theorem (the Ramanujan conjecture for GL2 over positive characteristic fields). The\nproof for d \u2265 3 is based on Lafforgue's work [La]. It also requires\nthe Jacquet-Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic - see\n[LSV1], Remark 1.6). We mention, however, that for d \u2265 3, quantitative estimates on Kazhdan property (T ) for P GLd (Fq ((y))) give a\nweaker estimate such as: either \u03bb \u2208 Ed or\n1\n19\n\u03bb \u2264 \u221a + o(1) \u2264 ,\nq\n20\nwhich is valid for every d and q. But only the case of d = 2 needs the\ndeep results from the theory of automorphic forms.\nRemark 3.6. The description above of the results from [LSV2] brings\nonly what is relevant to this paper. The bigger picture is as follows: The\ngroup A(R)\u2217 /R\u2217 is a discrete cocompact lattice in A(Fq ((y)))\u2217 /Fq ((y))\u2217 .\nThe latter is isomorphic to H = P GLd (Fq ((y))) and it acts on its\n\n\fFINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS\n\n7\n\nBruhat-Tits building B. The element b \u2208 H takes the initial point of\nthe building (the vertex x0 corresponding to the lattice Fq [[y]]d ) to a\nvertex x1 of distance one from it, where the color of the edge (x0 , x1 ) is\nalso one (so x1 corresponds to an Fq [[y]]-submodule of Fq [[y]]d of index\nq). The group F\u2217qd /F\u2217q acts transitively on these (q d \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1) neighbors of x0 of this type and the group \u0393 generated by the bu 's acts simply\ntransitive on the vertices of B - a result which goes back to Cartwright\nand Steger [CS]. For bu \u2208 S, b\u22121\nu takes x0 to a neighboring vertex of x0\nwhere the edge is of color d \u2212 1. When d = 2, d \u2212 1 = 1, and S is a\nsymmetric set of size q + 1 and Corollary 3.4 says that Cay(\u0393/\u0393(I), S)\nare Ramanujan graphs. For d \u2265 3, S \u2229 S \u22121 = \u2205 and Cay(\u0393/\u0393(I), S)\nd \u22121)\n. The Ramanujan complex\nare regular graphs of degree 2|S| = 2(qq\u22121\n\u0393/\u0393(I) is in fact isomorphic to the quotient \u0393(I)\\B of the Bruhat-Tits\nbuilding. On the building B (and on its quotients \u0393(I)\\B) we have an\naction of d \u2212 1 Hecke operators A1 , * * * , Ad\u22121 and the Ramanujan property gives bounds on their eigenvalues. For d \u2265 3, A1 + Ad\u22121 is nothing\nmore than the adjacency operator of the Cayley graph of \u0393/\u0393(I), and\nfor d = 2, A1 = Ad\u22121 and A1 is the adjacency operator.\nThe structure of the quotient group \u0393/\u0393(I) is analyzed in [LSV2];\nIf I is a prime ideal of R with R/I \u2243 Fqe , then \u0393/\u0393(I) is isomorphic to a subgroup of P GLd (q e ) containing P SLd (q e ). Theorem 7.1\nof [LSV2] gives a more precise description, showing that essentially all\nsubgroups between P SLd (q e ) and P GLd (q e ) can be obtained if I is\nchosen properly. The image of S in P GLd (q e ) which we also denote\nby S is composed of one element C, the image of b in the notations\nabove, and the conjugates of C by the non-split tori in P GLd (q e ) of\norder (q d \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1).\nNote that P GLd (q e )/P SLd (q e ) is a cyclic group and the image of S\nthere is a single element - the image of C, since all the other elements\nof S are conjugates of C. The eigenvalues in Ed above, may appear as\n\"lift up\" of the eigenvalues of the cyclic group generated by C (which is\na subgroup of P GLd (q e )/P SLd (q e ) and a quotient of \u0393/\u0393(I)) whose order divides d. These eigenvalues will be called \"the trivial eigenvalues\"\nof Cay(\u0393/\u0393(I); S) and they are in the subset Ed defined in Corollary\n3.4. If the image of \u0393 in P GLd (q e ) is only P SLd (q e ), then 1 is the only\ntrivial eigenvalue of \u2206 and all the others satisfy the bound of Corollary\n3.4.\nFor d large the issue of which subgroup of P GLd (q e ) is obtained\nis somewhat delicate. For d = 2, which is what is needed here for\n\n\f8\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nthe proof of Theorem 3, Theorem 7.1 of [LSV2] ensures that for pe >\n17, P SL2(pe ) can be obtained, if I is chosen properly. Thus\nCay(P SL2(pe ), S) are (p + 1)-regular Ramanujan graphs. They are,\ntherefore, also \u03b5-expanders by Proposition 2.1(ii), but with an unbounded number of generators.\nWe now show that this is true also with a bounded number of generators. An explicit form of Theorem 1.3 is:\nTheorem 3.7. The family of Cayley graphs Cay(P SL2 (l); {A, B, C, C \u2032}),\nwhen \u0012l = \u0013\npe is any\u0012 prime\u0013power, are uniformly expanders. (Here\n1 1\n0 1\nA =\n,B =\n, C is as in the description above when\n0 1\n\u22121 0\nd = 2 and q = p and C \u2032 will be described in the proof ).\nProof. Let C be as described above (with d = 2 and q = p a prime).\nThe image of S in P SL2 (pe ) as described above, is the set of conjugates\nof C under the action of the non-split torus T of P GL2 (p) which is\nisomorphic to F\u2217p2 /F\u2217p and of order p + 1. Denote T1 = T \u2229 P SL2 (p) a\nsubgroup of index at most 2 in T (in fact index 2, unless p = 2). Let C\nand C \u2032 be two representatives of the orbits of S, under conjugation by\nT1 : C as before and C \u2032 a representative of the other orbit (if exists).\nWe can now prove the Theorem by using Proposition 2.1: Let (V, \u03c1)\nbe a unitary representation of P SL2 (l), with an {A, B, C, C \u2032}-almost\ninvariant vector v. Restrict the representation \u03c1 to the subgroup P SL2 (p).\nBy Theorem 3.1, Cay(P SL2(p); {A, B}) are expanders and hence by\nProposition 2.1(iii), v is P SL2 (p) almost invariant. As it is also Calmost invariant, it is almost invariant under the set P SL2 (p) * C *\nP SL2 (p) and similarly with P SL2 (p) * C \u2032 * P SL2 (p). The union of\nthese last two sets contain\u221aS. So, v is S-almost invariant. But\n2 p\n19\nfor every p and e, so by Proposi\u03bb(Cay(P SL2(pe ), S)) \u2264 p+1 < 20\ne\ntion 2.1(ii), v is P SL2 (p )-almost invariant and by Proposition 2.1(i),\nCay(P SL2(pe ); {A, B, C, C \u2032}) are uniform expanders. This finishes the\nproof of Theorem 3.7 (and hence also of Theorem 1.3).\n\u0003\nRecall that by Proposition 2.3, Theorem 3.7 also says that the family\n{SL2 (l)|l a prime power} is family of expanders. Let us now quote:\nTheorem 3.8 (Hadad [H1], Theorem 1.2). . Let R be a finitely generated ring with stable range r and assume that the group ELd (R) for\nsome d \u2265 r has Kazhdan constant (k0 , \u03b5o ). Then there exist \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u03b50) >\n0 and k = k(k0 ) \u2208 N such that for every n \u2265 d, ELn (R) has Kazhdan\nconstant (k, \u03b5).\n\n\fFINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS\n\n9\n\nWe refer the reader to [H1] for the proof. We only mention here\nthat if R is a field then its stable range is 1 and ELn (R), the group of\nn\u00d7n matrices over R generated by the elementary matrices, is SLn (R).\nAlso recall that a finite group G has Kazhdan constant (k, \u03b5) if it has\na set of generators S of size at most k, such that for every non-trivial\nirreducible representation (V, \u03c1) of G and for every 0 6= v \u2208 V , there\nexists s \u2208 S such that k\u03c1(s)v \u2212 vk \u2265 \u03b5kvk. As is well known, this\nimplies that Cay(G; S) is \u03b5\u2032 -expander for some \u03b5\u2032 which depends only\non \u03b5. All these remarks combined with Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 give:\n\b\nTheorem 3.9. The groups SLn (q) all 2 \u2264 n \u2208 N, q prime power\nform a family of expanders uniformly.\nRemark 3.10. In the proof of Theorem 3.9, we used for d \u2265 3, Theorem 3.8 of Hadad whose proof was heavily influenced by Kassabov's\nproof [K1] that all SLn (q), n \u2265 3, are expanders. So our proof cannot be considered as a really different proof for n \u2265 3. In [KLN], a\nsecond very different proof for SLn , n \u2265 3 was announced, based on\nthe theory of Ramanujan complexes. But it turns out that the proof\nsketched there has a mistake, for which the author of the current paper\ntakes full responsibility. The idea there was to handle SLd , d even, say\nd = 2m, by using the following argument: Corollary 3.4 above gives\na spectral gap with respect to an unbounded subset S of (P )GLd (q)\nwhich consists of conjugates of a single element by a non-split tori T .\nThis T as a subgroup of G = GLd (q) is inside a copy of H = GL2 (q m ).\nPassing from G to P GLd (q), T is then in the image H\u0304 of H. We argued\nthere that by dividing by the center, T \u2282 H\u0304 and H\u0304 is isomorphic to\nP GL2 (q m ). (We then wanted to use Theorem 1.3 for H\u0304 to deduce that\nH\u0304 is an expander and to continue to argue as in the proof of Theorem\n3.7). It is not true however, that H\u0304 is P GL2 (q m ): we divided by the\ncenter of G which is of order at most d and not by the center of H\nwhich is of order q m \u2212 1 >> d. So H\u0304 has a large abelian quotient and\nit is far from being an expander.\n4. Bounded generation by SL(2)\nA finite group G is said to be a product of s copies of SL2 , if there\nexist prime powers qi and homomorphisms \u03c6i : SL2 (qi ) \u2192 G, i =\n1, . . . , s, such that for every g \u2208 G there exist xi \u2208 SL2 (qi ), i = 1, . . . , s\nwith g = \u03c61 (x1 ) * . . . * \u03c6s (xs ).\nTheorem 3.7 shows that all the groups SL2 (q) are uniform expanders\n(with 4 generators for each one). It now follows from Corollary 2.2 that\n\n\f10\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nfor a fixed s, all the groups which are products of s copies of SL2 are\nuniform expanders with 4s generators. We will now show that this is\nindeed the case for all finite simple groups of Lie type of bounded rank,\nexcluding the groups of Suzuki type.\nTheorem 4.1. There exists a function f : N \u2192 N, such that if G is a\nfinite simple group of Lie type of rank r, but not of Suzuki type, then\nit is a product of f (r) copies of SL2 .\nBefore giving the proof we remark that Theorem 4.1 combined with\nTheorem 3.9 and the result of Nikolov [N] implies Theorem 1.1. Indeed,\nby [N], a classical group of Lie type is a bounded product of groups of\ntype SLn (q) (n and q varies) and so by Theorem 3.9 they are uniform\nexpanders. The other finite simple groups of Lie type have bounded\nrank and so are bounded product of SL2 by Theorem 4.1, and hence\nalso uniform expanders. This excludes, of course, the Suzuki groups\nfor which every homomorphism from SL2 (q) to a Suzuki group has\ntrivial image since the order of the latter is not divisible by 3. Thus\nthe validity of Theorem 1.2 for the Suzuki groups is left open.\nBack to Theorem 4.1. This result has been announced in [KLN] and\na model theoretic proof based on the work of Hrushovski and Pillay\n[HP] was sketched there. Recently, Liebeck, Nikolov and Shalev [LNS]\nproved the theorem by standard group theoretic arguments. This is\nsomewhat more technical and requires some case by case analysis but\nhas the advantage that they came out with an explicit function f (r)\nwhich is valid for every group G of rank r. This is of importance for\nour application for expanders as it enables one to deduce explicit k and\n\u03b5 in Theorem 1.1.\nAnyway, we will bring here the model theoretic proof. For a nice\nintroduction to the model theory of finite simple groups, see [W]. As\nthere are only finitely many group types of bounded rank, we can take\nG to be a fixed (twisted or untwisted) Chevalley group and we need\nto prove the result for the groups G(F ) when F is a finite field. We\nwill show below that each such G(F ) contains a copy of (P )SL2(F ) as\na uniformly definable subgroup . By a definable subgroup, we mean\na subgroup that can be defined using a first order sentence in the\nlanguage of rings with a distinguished endomorphism - the language in\nwhich G is defined. By uniformly definable we mean that the subgroup\n(P )SL2 (F ) is defined by a single sentence - independent of F .\nAssuming this fact, we can argue as follows: Let Fi be an infinite\nfamily of finite fields and K = (\u03a0Fi )/U an ultra product of them,\n\n\fFINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS\n\n11\n\ni.e., U is a non-principle ultra-filter. Thus K is a pseudo-algebraically\nclosed field (PAC, for short \u2013 see [FJ] and [HP]). Let G\u0303 = \u03a0G(Fi )/U\nthe corresponding ultra product of the groups G(Fi ). By a basic result\n(Point [P], Propositions 1 and 2 and Corollary 1) G\u0303 is a simple group\nisomorphic to G(K) and similarly the ultra-product of the (P )SL2 (Fi )'s\ngives a subgroup (P )SL2 (K) of G\u0303 = G(K).\nNow, as G\u0303 = G(K) is simple, it is generated by the conjugates\nof (P )SL2 (K). By [HP, Proposition 2.1] G(K) is a product of m <\n\u221e conjugates of (P )SL2 (K). This is an elementary statement about\nG(K) and hence it is true also for G(Fi ) for almost all i. This proves\nwhat we need modulo the promised fact.\nRemark 4.2. The model theoretic proof gives (when one follows the\narguments in [HP]) that m \u2264 4 dim G. Moreover, in principal one can\ngive an explicit bound M such that the above claim is true for every F\nwith |F | > M. The proof in [LNS] gives explicit bounds on m which\nare usually (but not always) slightly better and are valid for all F .\nWe are left with proving our claim that G(F ) contains a copy of\n(P )SL2 (F ) as a uniformly definable subgroup.\nIf G splits (i.e. untwisted type), e.g. G = E6 , it contains SL2 as a\nsubgroup generated by a root subgroup and its opposite. Note that a\nroot subgroup is definable and as SL2 is a bounded product of the root\nsubgroup and its opposite, it is also definable. Of course, in this case\nit is even an algebraic subgroup.\nIf G is twisted, but not a group of Ree type (i.e. all the simple roots\nof G are of the same length, so the type is An , Dn or E6 ), e.g., look at\nG(q) =2E6 (q). Then G is the group of points of E6 (q 2 ) of the following\nform: {g \u2208 E6 (q 2 ) | g Fr = g \u03c4 } where \u03c4 is the graph automorphism\nof E6 and Fr the Frobenius automorphism. By restriction of scalars,\nthis is an algebraic group defined over Fq . If the automorphism \u03c4 has\na fixed vertex, e.g. for our example 2 E6 , then 2 E6 (q) contains a copy\nof SL2 (q)(\u2286 SL2 (q 2 ) \u2286 E6 (q 2 )) corresponding to this vertex and as an\nFq -group- this is an algebraic subgroup. The argument we illustrated\nhere with 2 E6 (q) works equally well with the other twisted groups with\nfixed vertex (of course, for 3 D4 we should take D4 (q 3 ) - but the rest\nis the same). This covers all the cases except of An , n even. But 2 An\nis anyway SU(n + 1) which contains SU(2) and it is well known that\nSU(2, q 2 ) is isomorphic to SL2 (q).\nWe are left with the twisted groups of Ree type: 2 F4 (22n+1 ) and\n2\nG2 (32n+1 ) (the other type 2 B2 (22n+1 ) give the Suzuki groups and these\n\n\f12\n\nALEXANDER LUBOTZKY\n\nwere excluded from the theorem). Now, 2 F4 (22n+1 ) is known (cf. [GLS]\nTable 2.4 VI, Table 2.4.7, Theorems 2.4.5 and 2.48) to have a subgroup\ngenerated by a root subgroup and its opposite which is isomorphic\nto SL2 (22n+1 ). (This is not the case for all roots; for some we get\nthe Suzuki groups, but we need only one root which gives SL2 ). For\n2\nG2 (32n+1 ) one can argue by pure group theoretical terms: it is known\n(cf. [E]) to have a unique conjugacy class of involutions and if \u03c4 is\nsuch an involution, then CG (\u03c4 ) - the centralizer of \u03c4 - is isomorphic to\nH = h\u03c4 i \u00d7 P SL2 (32n+1 ). Within H, P SL2(32n+1 ) is the set of all commutators of H (since every element of P SL2 (q) is a commutator). Thus\nP SL2 (32n+1 ) is a definable subgroup in a uniform way of 2 G2 (32n+1 ).\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 (and hence of 1.1) is now complete.\nReferences\n[BG]\n\nJean Bourgain and Alex Gamburd, New results on expanders, C.
