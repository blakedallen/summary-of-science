Jets and tori are prominent features of this evolution, but their\norigins are uncertain. Using optical and millimeter line kinematics, we determine\nthe ejection history in a sample of well-observed cases. We find that jets and\ntori develop nearly simultaneously. We also find evidence that jets typically\nappear slightly later than tori, with a lag time of a few hundred years. These\ncharacteristics provide strong evidence that jets and tori are physically related,\nand they set new constraints on theories of jet formation. The ejection of a\ndiscrete torus followed by jets on a short time scale favors the class of models in\nwhich a companion interacts with the central star. Models with long time scales,\nor with jets followed by a torus, are ruled out.\nSubject headings: circumstellar matter - planetary nebulae: general - stars:\nAGB and post-AGB - stars: mass loss\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPlanetary nebulae (PNe) are observed to exhibit remarkably complex morphologies that\nare not well understood (e.g., Balick & Frank 2002; Meixner et al. 2004). Point symmetry is\nthe most striking characteristic of the nebulae and is known to be produced by the action of\nhigh velocity jets which emanate from the central star system and interact with the circumstellar gas. The jets are typically bipolar, but may show multiple components or changes\nin direction. They are widely seen in young PNe and proto-PNe (e.g., Sahai & Trauger\n1998) and, in a few cases, in the final stages of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) (e.g.,\nImai et al. 2002). The origin of the jets is, however, uncertain.\nFour different types of scenario have been proposed for the formation of the jets: a\nmagnetic wind from single stars (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura et al. 2005); an accretion disk around a\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nbinary companion, fed by the mass-loss of the primary (Morris 1987; Soker & Rappaport\n2000); a magnetic (possibly explosive) wind from the primary, spun up by a companion\n(e.g., Nordhaus & Blackman 2006; Matt et al. 2006), and an accretion disk around the core\nof the primary, formed by the overflow or break-up of a binary companion during or after a common envelope phase (Soker & Livio 1994; Soker 1996; Reyes-Ruiz & L\u00f3pez 1999;\nNordhaus & Blackman 2006). In all these cases the region of jet launching is too small to\nbe resolved by current observations. Our constraints on the process of jet formation are,\ntherefore, necessarily indirect, based on their large scale properties and our understanding\nof the environment in which they form.\nA second, extremely common characteristic of PNe and proto-PNe is a region of equatorially enhanced mass loss. This often forms a relatively well defined structure, variously\ndescribed as a ring, or torus. The mass of this component may be large, & 0.1 M\u2299 with\ncorresponding mass loss rates & 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (e.g., Huggins et al. 2004), & 1\u20132 orders of\nmagnitude larger than typical mass loss rates on the upper AGB. The origin of this enhanced\nmass loss is not known for certain, but it terminates the evolution of the star on the AGB\nand occurs in the same transition phase as the first appearance of prominent jets.\nIn this paper we explore possible relations between the ejection of the tori and the\ndevelopment of jets. We determine the timing of their appearance as accurately as possible\nusing the kinematic structure of a sample of well-observed transition objects, and use the\nresults to evaluate different jet formation scenarios.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nIn order to investigate the time sequence for the appearance of jets and tori we consider\ntransition objects whose dimensions, kinematics, and orientation are sufficiently well characterized by observations that we can estimate when these features formed. The sample is\nlisted in Table 1. It includes late AGB stars, proto-PNe, and young PNe, although the status\nof M 2-9, which is usually included among young PNe is uncertain; it may be a symbiotic\nsystem, e.g., Corradi (2004). For convenience, we shall call the objects proto-PNe as a group.\nColumn (2) of the table gives the adopted distances for later use.\nThe objects in Table 1 were selected on the basis of the following criteria: they show\nwell defined jets and tori; the kinematic structure of the tori has been observed in millimeter\nCO emission at high angular resolution; and the kinematics of the jets have been observed in\nmolecular lines, or at optical wavelengths. In fact, the sample includes most of the transition\nobjects that have so far been mapped at high resolution in CO; we have omitted only a few\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncases in which the jets or equatorial regions are complex, e.g., AFGL 2688 (Cox et al. 2000),\nor the geometry is poorly determined. The emphasis here on molecular line observations of\nthe tori is important for providing robust reconstructions of the ejection history. There are,\nof course, many optical observations of the equatorial regions of fully formed PNe, but in\nthese cases the dynamical effects of pressure in the ionized gas make reconstruction of the\nejection history subject to large systematic uncertainty.\nTable 1 summarizes the data on the sample objects. Columns (3)\u2013(4) give estimates\nfor the radii and expansion velocities of the equatorial tori (rt and vt ) for each object,\nand columns (6)\u2013(7) give the radial extents and velocities for the jets (rj and vj ). The\nobservations on which these values are based are reported in the references in the table. The\nadopted values are taken from spatio-kinematic models or data summaries by the authors\ncited, or are based on new estimates made from maps given in the papers. The observations\nare corrected for projection using data on the inclination angles (which we take to be the\nangle between the axis of the torus or the jets, to the line of sight) given in the appendix.\nThe values of rt and rj are calculated using the distances given in column (2) of Table 1.\nThe data for the tori are based on interferometric CO observations. The values of rt\nrefer to characteristic radii of the tori. In cases where the inner hole is resolved by the\nobservations, rt is the radius of peak CO emission or the mean of inner and outer radii from\nmodel fits by the authors. If the inner hole is marginally resolved or not resolved, rt gives the\nradius modeled by the authors, or the half-intensity radius estimated from the CO emission\nmaps. The data for the jets are based on molecular line or optical observations. The values\nof rj and vj refer to the prominent jet heads farthest from the center of the system. These\ndata are typically averages for oppositely directed jets, but only one is used if the data for\nit are superior.\nThe data on the radial extents and velocities of the jets and tori are used to determine\nthe expansion times given by tj = rj /vj and tt = rt /vt . These are listed in columns (5)\nand (8) of Table 1. For three objects (He 3-1475, M 2-9, and KjPn 8), we have preferred\nto use expansion times for the jets determined from optical proper motions, because they\nare generally more accurate and are independent of the inclination angle. In these cases\ntj = \u03c6/\u03c6\u0307 where \u03c6 is the angular distance of the jet head from the central star and \u03c6\u0307 is its\ntime derivative.\nIn summary, the expansion times of the tori are all determined from molecular line\nobservations, while the expansions times of the jets are from molecular line kinematics,\noptical line kinematics, or optical proper motions. In two cases, M 1-16 and He 3-1475, there\nare measurements of additional jet heads closer to the central star system. Information on\nthese and further details of the observations are given in the appendix.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nTiming\n\nNear Simultaneity\n\nWe use the expansion times of the jets and tori as estimates for the time since they were\nejected from the central star systems. The large masses and low expansion velocities of the\ndense molecular tori mean that their expansion times (tt ) provide excellent estimates for their\ntravel times. For the jets, there is a good deal of observational evidence from detailed studies\nof individual objects for approximately Hubble-type outflows that also suggest constant\nvelocity, ballistic motions (e.g., Alcolea et al. 2001; Corradi 2004; Ueta et al. 2006). We\nassume that this applies to the jet heads considered here. We discuss this assumption\nfurther in \u00a73.2.\nFig. 1 compares the expansion times of the jets with the expansion times of the tori.\nThe squares denote cases where the torus is resolved, and the diamonds denote cases where\nit is not well resolved. The solid line shows the relation tj = tt .\nOne major uncertainty that affects the location of the data points in Fig. 1 is caused\nby uncertain distances to the nebulae. Apart from the exceptions noted below, this affects\nboth tj and tt in the same way: it moves the plotted points parallel to the line tj = tt in the\nfigure and does not appreciably affect our discussion.\nA second important effect that affects the location of the data points in Fig. 1 is uncertainty in the inclination angles of the jets and tori. The adopted values and estimates of\nthe uncertainties are given in the appendix. In most cases the values of tt and tj vary with\ninclination as sin \u03b8 and cot \u03b8, respectively, and the error bars shown in Fig. 1 represent the\nuncertainty due to the inclination angle. For the three objects whose jet expansion times\nare determined from proper motions, tj is independent of the inclination and the distance,\nand the error bars in the figure reflect the formal errors from the proper motions. For these\nobjects, the distance does contribute to the uncertainty in tt , but in all cases it is well determined (to within \u223c \u00b115%, see references in Table 1), and for simplicity this additional\ncontribution is omitted in the figure.\nA third effect, which is important for He 3-1475 and AGFL 618, arises because their\nequatorial regions are only marginally resolved by the observations so the dimensions of the\ntori are not well determined. In both cases the values for the torus parameters are taken\nfrom models of the CO emission (see appendix). The errors are difficult to quantify but are\nprobably within a nominal overall factor of two in tt , and these are shown as gray error bars\nin the figure.\nThe expansion times of the jets and tori shown in Fig. 1 span a large range, from\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\u223c 100 yr to several 1000 yr. In spite of the heterogeneity of the data and the uncertainties\nin individual cases, the figure shows that the ages of the jets and the ages of the tori are well\ncorrelated, and that the data points lie not far from the line tj = tt . The implication is that\nthe torus and jets in each object were ejected nearly simultaneously.\nIt is also of interest to note that the ejection ages are roughly ordered according to\nthe degree of evolution indicated by the spectral type of the star and/or the development\nof the nebula: i.e., from youngest to oldest corresponds to AGB stars, through proto-PNe\n(typically B-type spectra), to true PNe. This is consistent with all ejections (except perhaps\nM2-9 whose status is uncertain, see \u00a72) happening in the final stages of the AGB phase, or\nshortly thereafter.\n\n3.2.\n\nJet-Lag\n\nThe jets and tori have similar ages, but the data points in Fig. 1 lie systematically\nbelow the line tj = tt . The effect appears more pronounced for the younger systems in the\nlog-log plot, but it is also present for the older systems as well. The data in a few cases\nare consistent with tj = tt within the uncertainties, but for all objects our best estimates\nof the time difference \u2206t = tt \u2212 tj (column 9 in Table 1) are positive. This ordering has\npreviously been noted in individual cases (e.g., Forveille et al. 1998; Huggins et al. 2000;\nS\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. 2004), but the result for the ensemble as a whole makes it much\nmore concrete, especially in view of the fact that tj refers to the heads of the jets, and tt\nrefers to the mean radius of the tori (or some similar measure) in most cases. In fact, given\nthe diversity of the data used to compile the figure, the uniformity of the effect is striking.\nThere are two likely explanations of the observed effect that need to be considered, and\nwe discuss each in turn. The first is that the values of tj and tt are good approximations to\nthe actual travel times of the jets and tori (as previously assumed), but the jets and tori are\nnot exactly simultaneous. The observed effect is produced if the jets are slightly younger\nthan the tori, i.e., there is a small but systematic delay in the launching of the jets relative\nto the tori. If so, this delay, or jet-lag, is given by the value of \u2206t. It might correspond, for\nexample, to a power-up time for the jets, or an accretion time scale (\u00a74.2.2). Inspection of\nTable 1 (column 9) shows that the largest value of \u2206t is for the oldest system (KjPn 8), but\nthe others are comparable, within the large uncertainties. The median jet-lag is 300 yr.\nThe second explanation to consider is that the jets and tori are ejected simultaneously,\nbut the expansion times differ from the actual travel times. The expansion times of the\nmassive molecular tori are almost certainly good approximations to the travel times for\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nreasons given earlier. In the event that they are formed deep within the star, they could\nbe decelerated by overlying layers, but this is unlikely to affect the timing over the large\ndistances and long time intervals accessible to the observations. We therefore confine our\nattention to the jets. These move through the circumstellar environment at high velocity,\nand from a theoretical point of view their kinematic behavior is uncertain, so we consider\nvarious possibilities in turn.\nIf the ejection of a jet is short-lived, the jet head may act as a bullet, in which case\nit would travel at a constant velocity, or decelerate to the extent that it interacts with\nambient circumstellar gas. The deceleration of He 3-1475 has been considered by Riera et al.\n(2003) and is estimated to be relatively small, although the theory of bullet interactions with\nambient gas is not fully developed. More generally, if the head decelerates, it can be seen\nR\nby writing the actual travel time as t = dr/v(r) that the value of tj given by the current\n(observed) value of rj /vj (or the equivalent proper motion \u03c6/\u03c6\u0307) overestimates the travel\ntime. Therefore, if the ejections of the jets and tori were simultaneous, the apparent ages of\nthe jets would be older than the tori, an effect opposite to that seen in Fig. 1. We conclude\nthat deceleration does not dominate the observations, and if it were to play any quantitative\nrole, the true jet-lag would be larger than that tabulated in Table 1.\nA different situation occurs if the jet is continuous over an extended interval of time.\nTo illustrate this case, we consider a jet driven through the circumstellar gas by a radial,\nmomentum-conserving, fast outflow, with a narrow, fixed, opening angle. For an envelope\nwith a density that varies as r \u22122 , which corresponds to a constant mass loss rate, the velocity\nof the jet head is a constant to first order (Lee et al. 2001). However, according to the\nsimulations of Lee & Sahai (2003), the effects of the motion of material along the sides of\nthe jets may lead to a small acceleration. The velocity of the jet head may then be written\nas v = uj (1 + \u03b1t), where uj is the initial velocity and \u03b1 is a parameter with a typical value\n\u223c 10\u22123 yr\u22121 for the simulations they present. If the jets and tori were ejected simultaneously,\nwe can identify t with tt and would expect the apparent ages of the jets to be smaller than\nthe ages of the tori by \u2206t given by:\n\u2206t\n\u03b1t\n=\n.\nt\n2(1 + \u03b1t)\n\n(1)\n\nThis expression has values of \u03b1t/2 \u223c 0, 0.25, and 0.5, for \u03b1t \u226a 1, \u03b1t = 1, and \u03b1t \u226b 1,\nrespectively. For an ensemble of objects, we then expect \u2206t/t to range from near zero for\nyoung systems, up to 0.5 for very old systems. The observed values are listed in column\n(10) of Table 1. They show the opposite behavior, with the largest values for the youngest\nsystems. It is not possible to rule out acceleration in any individual case, but there is\nno strong evidence for it from the ensemble of data. In view of this, and the extensive\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nempirical evidence for approximately Hubble-like jet flows cited earlier, we conclude that jet\nacceleration is probably not the primary effect, and that the jet-lag sequence is the preferred\none.\nOn the basis that the expansion times are reasonable approximations of the travel times,\nwe can reconstruct the time evolution of the torus-jet sequence. The time line for each object\nis shown in Fig. 2. The filled symbols denote the values of tt already discussed, and represent\nthe average or characteristic expansion times of the tori. The horizontal lines represent the\ntime interval over which the tori are ejected. These are based on the radial extents of the\ntori (e.g., the half intensity widths or model fits to the radial extent), and assuming the\nejection takes place at the mean expansion velocity for each object listed in the Table 1.\nIf the tori are ejected with a significant dispersion in velocity, the time lines overestimate\nthe width of the corresponding ejection interval. M 1-92 may be an extreme case with a\nvelocity gradient that suggests it was ejected in a short time (Alcolea et al. 2007, see also\nAppendix A2). The information on the partially resolved tori (AFGL 618 and He3-1475)\nis incomplete. The triangles on each line in Fig. 2 denote the times at which the jets are\nejected, and are subject to the uncertainties in timing discussed above. For two objects, M\n1-16 and He 3-1475, the timing of later jets (see appendix) is also shown, to illustrate the\noverall sequence.\nThe ejection sequences for all the objects shown in Fig. 2 are qualitatively similar. There\nis a rapid build-up of the torus and then the jets are launched, and may reoccur. As discussed\nabove, our best estimates suggest a finite lag time for the jets, with a median of 300 yr. If\nthis is measured with respect to the onset of the torus ejection, it is probably somewhat\nlonger. The interval between the jets in the objects with a sequence of jets is comparable to\nthe jet-lag time.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\nJets and Tori\n\nThe ejection of jets and tori are among the most important events in the transition\nof stars from the AGB to the PN phase. Our finding that they occur close together in\ntime provides strong evidence that they are physically related, either causally, or by some\nunderlying process or event linking the two.\nOur additional finding that jets and tori probably occur in a particular sequence, underscores their connection. These results, together with the time-scale for the torus ejection and\nthe time scale for the torus-jet sequence, provide basic constraints on formation scenarios.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nDespite their connections, it is important to emphasize that the actual ejections of jets\nand tori are different in character. The jets involve high velocity, axial outflows, while the\ntori involve low velocity equatorial outflows. The difference in the velocities is highlighted\nby the data listed in Table 1. The median velocity of the jets is 160 km s\u22121 and the median\nvelocity of the tori is 10 km s\u22121 . It is noteworthy that the latter is comparable to, but below\nthe typical wind velocity on the upper AGB: the median envelope velocities for bright carbon\nstars, infrared carbon stars, and OH/IR stars, are 11.4 km s\u22121 , 17.8 km s\u22121 , and 13.6 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively (Olofsson 2003). In addition, in the individual cases M 1-16 (Huggins et al. 2000)\nand AFGL 618 (S\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. 2004), the tori have lower expansion velocities than\nthe extended AGB envelopes. Thus the torus ejection, which may also involve a very high\nmass-loss rate (\u00a71), is likely to be a different process from, or at least a modification of, the\nregular AGB mass loss.\n\n4.2.\n\nFormation Scenarios\n\nThe linking of jets and tori, and their related time scales, considerably extend the\nrange of constraints we have on jet formation. In the following, we comment on how these\nconsiderations affect our evaluation of specific scenarios that have been proposed. Table 2 is\nused to help keep track of the different possibilities.\n\n4.2.1. Magnetic Winds from Single Stars\nOne scenario for jet formation proposed by Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura and co-workers is a collimated\nwind from single stars in the proto-PN phase. Their models (e.g., Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura et al. 2005)\ndo not appear to naturally give rise to the ejection of a torus close in time with the jets.\nThe equatorial density enhancements that are featured in some of their simulations are input\nseparately, and do not appear to constitute a discrete ejection. In view of the close connection\nbetween jets and tori presented in this paper, the single star models do not currently give a\ngood description of the observations.\n\n4.2.2. Companion Accretion Disks\nA second class of scenarios for jet formation occurs in binary systems where part of\nthe matter lost in the wind of the evolving AGB star (the primary) is captured by a binary\ncompanion (the secondary) and forms a disk (Morris 1987; Soker & Rappaport 2000). The\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndisk in turn forms jets. The jet launching mechanism is not known for certain, but is probably\nsimilar to that in young stellar objects (e.g., Frank & Blackman 2004).\nThere is growing evidence for binary interactions in AGB stars with high mass loss\nrates (e.g., Mauron & Huggins 2006), and the binary accretion disk scenario is consistent\nwith our findings on several points. (1) The presence of a close binary provides a mechanism\nto enhance the mass loss of the primary, and to preferentially confine the mass loss to the\norbital plane. (2) If a discrete torus forms, the increase in mass loss produces an increase in\nthe accretion rate of the disk; assuming that jets are enhanced or perhaps triggered by the\nincreased accretion, this model provides the basis of a causal link between tori and jets. (3)\nThis causal relationship also has the potential to account for the delay in launching the jets.\nThe delay due to the travel time of material between the primary and the secondary is\nexpected to be small under most circumstances, e.g., \u2206t = 5 yr for a separation of 10 AU\nand a gas velocity of 10 km s\u22121 . However, a significant delay could arise because it takes a\nfinite time for matter accreted by a disk to spiral into the inner regions where the jets are\npresumably launched. In the present scenario, the increased accretion rate of the disk will\noccur during the build-up of the torus, so that the jets will be delayed by a time comparable\nto the accretion time of the disk. This is given by the expression t\u03bd = R2 /\u03bd, where R is the\nradius of the disk and \u03bd is the viscosity. In the \u03b1-prescription (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973),\nthis can be parameterized as:\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011\u22121 \u0012 R \u00133/2 \u0012 M \u0013\u22121/2 \u0012 H/R \u0013\u22122\n2\nt\u03bd = 160 yr\n,\n0.1\n1 AU\n1 M\u2299\n0.1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the usual viscosity parameter, M2 is the mass of the companion, and H is the\nscale height of the disk.\nThe sizes of the disks are unknown, but simulations of accretion by relatively close\ncompanions (Theuns & Jorissen 1993; Mastrodemos & Morris 1999) and tidal truncation\n(Pastetter & Ritter 1989) suggest disks with radii \u223c 1 AU may be formed. For disks of this\nsize and reasonable values for the companion mass and disk thickness, it can be seen that\nif \u03b1 is as low 10\u22123 \u201310\u22124 as found by Bell & Lin (1994) to reproduce the flaring time of FU\nOri stars, the accretion times would be & 104 yr. This kind of time scale is completely ruled\nout by the short jet-lags observed. For a typical jet-lag of \u223c 300 yr, a disk of radius 1 AU\nrequires \u03b1 & 0.05. Thus, if this model proves relevant, the jet-lag has the potential to probe\nproperties of the disks that are currently unobservable in any other way.\nThe points outlined above are consistent with the binary accretion disk model. In\naddition, if M 2-9 proves to be a symbiotic system with a detached companion (see \u00a72), it\nadds support to this interpretation. There is, however, one aspect of the observations that is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nnot naturally explained by this scenario, and that is the ejection of a torus. Enhanced massloss is certainly a feature expected in close binary systems, but the formation mechanism of\na discrete torus is unclear.\nIn their binary model for PNe with narrow waists, Soker & Rappaport (2000) argue that\nthe tori are formed by the effects of a collimated fast wind (i.e., the jets) from the companion,\nby concentrating the AGB wind toward the equatorial plane. If the fast wind extends\nover a wide angle in latitude and forms a hot bubble, it may contribute to the equatorial\nconcentration, but the simulations of Garc\u0131\u0301a-Arredondo & Frank (2004) with more directed\njets show mainly local enhancements around the flow cavities and no clear build up of a\nlarge scale torus. In any event the relatively sudden appearance of low velocity tori with\nlarge masses (and large mass loss rates) cannot be explained by simply compressing the gas\nin latitude. A trigger or event to produce the tori is much more likely. One possibility is\nmagnetic expulsion along the lines discussed in the next section, powered by spin-up of the\nenvelope, and triggered at a point when the overlying mass of the AGB envelope is reduced\nto a critical level. This and other ways to generate a torus within this scenario warrant\nfurther attention.\nA variant of the binary accretion disk scenario is one in which a disk first forms around\nthe companion and blows jets (e.g., as a result of wind accretion or Roche lobe overflow of\nthe primary), and then enters the primary in a common envelope and ejects a torus (see\nnext section). This sequence of jets followed by a torus is ruled out by the observations.\n\n4.2.3. Magnetic Effects in Common Envelopes\nA range of scenarios for jet formation occurs where there is direct interaction between a\nclose binary companion and the AGB star in a common envelope phase (Iben & Livio 1993).\nIn this phase, the companion is engulfed by the AGB star: it may spiral in toward the center\non a rapid time scale . 10 yr, and if the mass of the companion is above \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 , it can\ndeposit enough energy to eject a significant portion of the AGB envelope (e.g., Soker & Livio\n1994; Nordhaus & Blackman 2006). Simulations show that the envelope is ejected on a short\ntime scale (\u223c 1 yr), mainly in the equatorial plane of the system (Sandquist et al. 1998).\nThe ejection, therefore, provides a natural mechanism for the formation of an expanding\ntorus.\nDuring the interaction, the envelope may be spun up by the secondary, and this can\nenhance the magnetic field by dynamo action to produce a jet, with a short lifetime .\n100 yr (Nordhaus & Blackman 2006). If both spin-up and ejection occur during the common\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nenvelope phase, this would generate jets and a torus close in time as observed. It remains\nto be seen from detailed simulations whether the jet-lag sequence is a natural feature of this\nscenario.\nA related scenario discussed by Matt et al. (2006) is one in which rotational shear between the core and envelope builds up the magnetic field until it explodes in both the polar\nand equatorial directions. This case is attractive because the jets and torus are likely to\nform close in time, as observed, and the magnetic field in the torus may have observable\ncharacteristics (Huggins & Manley 2005; Sabin et al. 2007). Again, it remains to be seen\nfrom detailed simulations whether the jet-lag sequence is a natural feature of this scenario.\nIn either the hydrodynamic or the magnetic expulsion of the equatorial gas, a very\nimportant constraint provided by the ensemble of observations in Table 1 is the low velocity\nof the tori (Table 1). The ejection of matter from the deep potential well of a close binary\nor in a magnetic explosion likely leads to a range of ejection velocities and this point needs\nto be evaluated in realistic simulations. If the simulations are unable to produce coherent\nlow velocity tori, these formation mechanisms could be ruled out.\nSeveral other considerations bear on this class of scenarios. In the case of V Hya\n(Table 1), Barnbaum et al. (1995) have found that the photospheric lines are broadened,\nand interpret this as evidence that the star is currently in the common envelope phase. If\nthis is so, the radially extended torus (Hirano et al. 2004) implies an extended interval of\nequatorial mass-loss of \u223c 1500 yr as shown in Fig. 2. This is much longer than the ejection\ntimes found in simulations of common envelope ejection noted above. On the other hand,\nKnapp et al. (1999) find evidence for a 17 yr period in V Hya, which may indicate a detached\nbinary system.\nIn the case of M 1-92 (Table 1), Alcolea et al. (2007) interpret their observations to\nindicate that the jets and torus are exactly simultaneous, and therefore support the magnetic\nexplosion model. For the best available estimate of the inclination angle of the system that\nwe adopt (see appendix), the jets are marginally younger than the torus, as in all the other\nobjects, so there is no compelling reason that they must be simultaneous. It is also true that\nthe magnetic expulsion models are at very early stages of exploration; they may not in fact\ngive rise to exactly simultaneous polar and equatorial ejections and may be consistent with\nthe jet-lag picture.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.4. Primary Accretion Disks\nA further class of scenarios that may produce jets involves a binary companion that\nforms an accretion disk around the primary during or after the common envelope phase.\nIf the companion is of low mass (brown dwarf or planet), it enters the AGB star and\nspirals in toward the core, where it is gravitationally shredded to form a disk that may blow\njets through the envelope (Soker 1996; Reyes-Ruiz & L\u00f3pez 1999; Nordhaus & Blackman\n2006). A very low mass secondary has insufficient energy to eject much of the AGB envelope\nduring the spiral-in process, so it does not naturally lead to the formation of a massive torus.\nHowever, the primary may go on to later eject the envelope, possibly with an equatorial\nenhancement. In this scenario, there is no particular co-ordination of jets and torus, and it\nyields a sequence of jets followed by a torus, which is opposite to that observed in all the\nobjects discussed here. This scenario can be rejected.\nIn a variant of this scenario (Nordhaus & Blackman 2006), the mass of the secondary\nmay be enough to eject part of the AGB envelope in a torus before the companion is shredded\nto form a disk. This leads to a torus-jet sequence, as observed. The time sequence is likely\nto be short because the spiral-in and break-up times are rapid, but a viscous jet-lag of the\nform given by equation (2) may be relevant, if the viscosity parameter is low enough to\ncompensate for a small disk radius.\nAn alternative scenario with an accretion disk around the primary occurs when the\nsecondary is a main sequence star of mass & 0.1 M\u2299 . In this case, the envelope of the\nAGB star is ejected in the common envelope phase as a torus; the spiral-in process of the\nsecondary comes to halt, but it may subsequently undergo Roche lobe overflow to form a\ndisk around the primary (Soker & Livio 1994). This produces a clear torus-jet sequence as\nobserved. However, there are two problems with this scenario. First, the timescale between\nthe torus ejection and the disk-jet formation is governed by the thermal response time of the\nsecondary, which is 103 \u2013104 yr (Soker & Livio 1994). This is somewhat too long compared\nwith the typical jet-lag sequence that we find from the observations. The second problem\nis that the jets in this scenario are produced after the common envelope phase. It seems\nunlikely that the coolest objects that we consider (which have already formed jets) are post\ncommon-envelope; this may also apply to all the objects in the sample given the ages of\ntheir jets and their likely evolution times across the H-R diagram. Except for the ejection\nplus break-up case noted above, these primary disk scenarios are not well matched to the\nobservations.\nIt is interesting to note that Mitchell et al. (2006) have recently reported on the kinematics of the PN Abell 63, which has a close binary central star and must have gone through\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\na common envelope phase. Mitchell et al. (2006) find that the lobes (jets) in Abell 63 are\nolder than the nebular rim which forms the inner edge of a cylindrical torus. They conclude\nthat this is consistent with jets formed after a common envelope (from a disk around the\nprimary core) but before formation of the main nebula. As remarked above, the sequence\nof jets followed by a torus is the opposite of all the cases discussed in this paper. It could\nbe that Abell 63 is different. On the other hand, the jets are very old (13,000 yr), so it is\nunclear if simple kinematics can be used to infer such long travel times. In addition, the\nage of the rim is determined from observations of ionized gas whose dynamical evolution\nduring the formation of the nebula is uncertain. In view of these caveats, the conclusions of\nMitchell et al. (2006) on the jet sequence in Abell 63 need to be viewed with some caution.\n\n4.2.5. Summary Evaluation\nFrom the above discussion, it can be seen that there are quite a number of scenarios\nthat might potentially produce jets in proto-PNe, and it may be that more than one of them\nactually occurs. However, the properties of the objects discussed in this paper, with well\ndefined jets and molecular tori, are sufficiently uniform that a common mechanism seems\nmost reasonable.\nOn this basis, our discussion shows that the timing observations place quite stringent\nconstraints on the physical picture, as summarized in Table 2. Some specific scenarios for\njet formation, in which the jets and tori occur in the wrong sequence, or are unconnected,\nor have time scales that are too long, are ruled out or made implausible. The relatively\nsudden ejection of a discrete torus followed by jets on a short time scale most naturally fits\nthe types of scenario in which a companion directly interacts with the central star. The\nphysical situations in these scenarios are quite different, but theoretical exploration has not\nyet gone much beyond order of magnitude estimates. More realistic simulations are needed\nto predict the detailed characteristics of specific models so that we can discriminate among\nthe possibilities.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe objects described in this paper cover a range in evolution from AGB stars to young\nPNe, but they all exhibit high velocity polar jets and dense equatorial molecular tori. From\nanalysis of the timing of the jets and tori we reach the following conclusions.\nFirst, the launching of the jets is approximately simultaneous with the ejection of the\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ntori. This implies a close connection between the two, and provides important information\non the physical system in which the jets are formed.\nSecond, there is evidence for a torus-jet sequence. In some cases the observations are\nconsistent with close or exact simultaneity, but the ensemble of data suggest a torus-jet\nsequence with a median jet-lag \u223c 300 yr. The main uncertainty here is the possible role\nof jet acceleration. This has a somewhat similar effect as a delay, but is probably not the\ndominant effect.\nThird, the ejection velocities and time scales provide further constraints on the physical\npicture. The low expansion velocities of the tori in particular may pose a challenge for\nmodels in which tori are ejected from the deep potential well of a common envelope.\nThese findings already rule out or make implausible several jet formation scenarios.\nOverall, the relatively sudden ejection of a discrete torus followed by jets on a short time\nscale most naturally fits the types of scenario in which a companion interacts with the central\nstar. More detailed simulations of specific models are needed to help us discriminate among\nthe possibilities.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge collaborative programs with R. Bachiller, P. Cox, and\nT.

For the jets, the observed\nradial extents and velocities are rj sin \u03b8j and vj cos \u03b8j , respectively, where rj and vj are the\nactual (un-projected) values. For the tori, the radii rt are seen directly on the sky at the\nsystemic velocity, and the maximum observed radial velocities are vt sin \u03b8t . The expansion\ntime scales, tj and tt , are therefore sensitive to the inclination angle, and vary as cot \u03b8j\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nand sin \u03b8t , respectively. Exceptions for which the expansion time scales are determined in a\ndifferent way are noted below.\nThe adopted inclination angles for each source are given in Table 3, together with\nestimates of the uncertainty. In five sources there are independent estimates of \u03b8t and \u03b8j ,\nand in the others there are estimates of only one: for these we assume that \u03b8t = \u03b8j . This is\nreasonable on the basis of the similarity where there are independent estimates, and by the\nfact that many (though not all) images show that jets are roughly aligned with the axes of\nthe tori when seen in projection.\nThe uncertainties adopted for the inclination angles given in Table 2 are of two types.\nIn specific cases noted in the footnotes to the table, the values of \u2206\u03b8 are taken from the\nreferences cited. For the others we have made rough estimates, based on the the observations\nand, where relevant, on the agreement between different estimates: for simplicity in these\ncases we have adopted values for \u2206\u03b8 of \u00b15\u25e6 or \u00b110\u25e6 . For the sources where we assume\n\u03b8t = \u03b8j , the errors in Fig. 1 are correlated; and for the three objects in which tj is estimated\ndirectly from proper motions, the results are independent of the inclination.\n\nA.2.\n\nNotes on Individual Sources\n\nKjPn 8.\u2013 \u03b8t is re-determined from the velocity strip maps of the torus (Forveille et al.\n1998), and agrees with \u03b8j from the jet kinematics given by Meaburn (1997). tj is from optical\nproper motions of the jets, 34 \u00b1 3 mas yr\u22121 (Meaburn 1997).\nM 1-16.\u2013 The adopted value of \u03b8j (from Schwarz 1992) is at the top of the range given\nby Corradi & Schwarz (1993); this value is preferred because the jets align with the torus\naxis on the sky and this is the closest value to \u03b8t , which is well determined. The inner edge of\nmolecular torus is not well resolved by the CO observations; the limit in Fig. 2 corresponds\nto the radius of the small ionized nebula. tj for the two additional jet components in Fig. 2\nare 1050 yr and 740 yr (Schwarz 1992).\nM 2-9.\u2013 tj is from optical proper motions of the jets, 51 \u00b1 7 mas yr\u22121 (Schwarz et al.\n1997).\nM 1-92.\u2013 The adopted value of \u03b8j = 57 \u00b1 5\u25e6 (Solf 1994) is from a geometrical method\nusing Doppler shifts in the jets. tt and tj are based on the equatorial and polar velocity\ngradients (12 and 7.6 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 , respectively) given by Alcolea et al. (2007); using\nthe gradient for the torus gives a value of tt that depends on tan \u03b8t . The gradient suggests\na torus ejection event, although the jet outflows in this source are particularly wide-angle\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nand extend to low latitudes so that the torus may be wind-swept; this may account for the\ngradient. Alcolea et al. (2007) assume the torus and jets are ejected at the same time, which\nrequires an inclination angle of 51.5\u25e6 to get the same expansion time scales. In Figs. 1 and\n2 we use the independent value of Solf (1994) given above.\nM 2-56.\u2013 The inner rim of torus not well resolved; the limit in Fig. 2 corresponds to half\nthe beamsize.\nHe 3-1475.\u2013 The data for the torus are uncertain because it is marginally resolved\nby the CO observations. The adopted values are from the CO model by Huggins et al.\n(2004). Other rough estimates give comparable values for tt . For example, the strong, low\nvelocity OH masers are spread over an area of radius \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 5 and a velocity of \u223c 18 km s\u22121\n(Zijlstra et al. 2001); this gives tt \u223c 1000 yr. tj is from optical proper motions of the jets,\n12.6 \u00b1 1.1 mas yr\u22121 (Riera et al. 2003). The younger jets shown in Fig. 2 have tj = 446 yr,\nfrom proper motions for knots NW2 and SW2 given by Riera et al. (2003).\nV Hya.\u2013 rt is the half power radius at the systemic velocity in the CO 3\u20132 line from\nthe maps by Hirano et al. (2004). The inner rim is not well resolved, the limit in Fig. 2\ncorresponds to half the beamsize.\nAFGL 618.\u2013 The data for the torus are uncertain because it is marginally resolved by the\nCO observations. The adopted values are from the CO model by S\u00e1nchez Contreras et al.\n(2004) with velocity \u221d radius; the inner rim is not resolved. Roughly the same value of\ntt (\u223c 400 yr) is obtained independently from an expanding torus model of the dense inner\nregions (rt \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 75, vt \u223c 5\u201312 km s\u22121 ) observed in HC3 N (Pardo et al. 2004). \u03b8j is for the\nsingle jet b in the nomenclature of Trammell & Goodrich (2002) and vj is the H2 velocity\nfor same jet (Cox et al. 2003).\n\u03c0 1 Gru.\u2013 Data for the torus are from the CO model by Chiu et al. (2006); rt is the\ngeometric mean of the inner and outer model radii.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlcolea, J., Bujarrabal, V., S\u00e1nchez Contreras, C., Neri, R., & Zweigle, J. 2001, A&A, 373,\n932\nAlcolea, J., Neri, R., & Bujarrabal, V. 2007, A&A, in press, astro-ph/0701455\nBalick, B., & Frank, A. 2002, ARA&A, 40, 439\nBarnbaum, C., Morris, M., & Kahane, C. 1995, ApJ, 450, 862\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nBell, K.

The squares denote cases\nwhere the tori are resolved, and the diamonds where they are marginally resolved. The\nerror bars reflect the uncertainties in the inclination angles or proper motions. The extra,\ngray error bars reflect a nominal factor of 2 uncertainty in the dimensions of the marginally\nresolved tori. The continuous line shows the locus on which the expansion time scales are\nequal.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Time sequence for the ejection of jets and tori. The horizontal axis is time in the\npast, measured from the current epoch. The filled squares and diamonds show the fiducial\ntimes of torus ejection as in Fig. 1. The horizontal lines show the characteristic duration\nof the torus ejection, assuming a constant ejection velocity. In cases where the inner rim of\nthe torus is not seen, the time line is truncated with a small vertical line corresponding to\nthe resolution limit. Data for the time lines of the marginally resolved cases (diamonds) are\nincomplete. M 1-92 may be ejected in a single event. The triangles denote the times of jet\nejection. Data on the multiple jets in He 3-1475 and M 1-16 are given in the appendix.\n\n\f"}
