Generically, the system exchanges energy and information with\nthe environment through quantum interaction processes\nwhich lead to system-environment correlations. If we\ncannot keep track of the environmental degrees of freedom we eventually lose information about the system\non so-called decoherence processes [1]. This is a major\nobstacle for quantum computation and quantum information processing, since this environmental interaction\nspoils quantum data, in the sense that it disrupts qubit\nstates causing errors and degrades resources such as entanglement, necessary for some quantum algorithms. In\nthe quantum scale the environment was long seen as an\nentity whose action needed to be eliminated in order to\npreserve quantum information in the system.\nAs an attempt to address this issue, quantum error correcting codes were developed to suppress the degradation\ninduced by the environment [2\u20136]. Most of these codes\nrely on redundancy and global operations, meaning they\nuse many physical qubits to encode the logical qubits and\nuse global operations on these several qubits to correct\nfor the errors and/or detect the error syndromes. Passive\ncodes, named error avoiding codes, were also developed\nand those are based on decoherence free subspaces in\nwhich a subspace of the system does not evolve under the\ncoupling to the environment [7]. The first designed error\ncorrecting codes used projective measurements to detect\nthe errors and unitary operations to correct them. Not\nlong after the first codes, and still recently, environment\nmeasurements and Hamiltonian feedback were employed\nin error correction protocols [8\u201315]. In the context of errors caused by spontaneous emission, hybrid codes combining passive and active codes were developed [8\u201311],\nin which there are clearly two different kinds of errors,\nthose that are avoided by encoding the quantum data in\n\na decoherence free subspace and those that need a direct\naction given that the error has occurred. Such spontaneous emission correcting codes relied on the ability to\ncontinuously monitor the environment (global measurements on independent environments in [8] or a measurement over a global environment in [10]), on the encoding\nof the logical qubits into entangled physical qubit states\nand also on complicated global operations on several subsystems for the active error correction. It was then realized that a significant redundancy reduction was possible\nwhen the distance between the physical systems is much\nlarger than the wavelength of the emitted excitations [11],\nwhich also makes the error detection a local process. Further improvement on the number of required resources\nwas given in [13] with the aid of a global driving Hamiltonian. Therefore statistically independent environments\nprobably provide a better suited scenario for less demanding quantum computation. However, these proposals scale badly in the sense that as the number of logical\nqubits grows one needs to collectively control the behavior of many systems through intricate global operations in\norder to protect quantum information which is encoded\ninto multi-qubit entangled states. As another possible\nstrategy, continuous feedback has been applied to suppress decoherence due to spontaneous emission [16], and\nfeedback based strategies have also been devised to create and protect known entangled states [17]. However,\nall the previous efficient proposals for sustaining entanglement require global operations and hence do not allow\nfor distant entanglement based communication [17].\nLet us clarify what we mean by local and global operations. Consider a network whose nodes are quantum systems, and that each quantum system may be composed\nof smaller subsystems: in our case three level systems\n(or qutrits). By global operation we mean any operation\nthat is not a product of single operations on the individual subsystems, and conversely, a local operation can be\nexpressed as a product of such single location operations.\n\n\f2\nLocal operations such as single qudit operations in unison can be simple to implement, however operations such\nas measurements comprising more than 2 close-by qudit\nlocations can be very hard to implement. Furthermore,\nif the subsystems are located at distant nodes global operation might be impossible to implement. Therefore,\nerror correcting codes relying solely on local operations\nare much more desirable.\nIn [18] the authors have proposed a local decay quantum\nerror correcting code also combining active and passive\nprotocols in which a logical qubit is locally encoded in a\nphysical qutrit. In this code the errors are detected by\nlocally measuring the independent environments and the\nsystem is deterministically recycled through local feedback. Therefore the code is 100% local and requires neither entangled ancillas nor global operations. Similar\nqudit encoding techniques were employed for error correcting continuous variable systems and phase dumping\nin qudit systems [19, 20]. However, for the spontaneous\nemission codes shown here and in [18], the minimal qudit\ndimension is d = 3, which is much less demanding and\nmuch simpler than the codes shown in [19, 20]. Since\nthe protocol is strictly local it can also be used to protect known entangled states shared by spatially separated\ndifferent parties, thus allowing for entanglement based\nquantum communication between them.\nIn this paper we extend these results to the diffusion\nlimit, that is, we develop a similar qutrit encoding and\nfeedback error correction for the case in which the measurements performed over the reservoirs present extra\nsources of noise other than the system-environment interaction (such as that introduced by a classical oscillator\nin a homodyne measurement). We also extend the analysis previously done, testing our protocol against several\nsources of inefficiency and pointing out the most important ones.\nFinally, it is worth saying that this feedback error correction is based on the indistinguishability of the decay\nchannels of the qutrits in a cascade-like energy structure. In the end of the paper, we analyze the dynamics of\nqutrit-qutrit entanglement for different energy configurations of the three-level systems and analyze the possibility of maintaing or even enhancing entanglement through\nreservoir monitoring, also extending earlier results on the\neffects of abrupt changes and sudden death of distillability [21] in 3 \u2297 3 systems.\n\nII.\n\nMEASURING THE ENVIRONMENT AND\nINFORMATION FEEDBACK\n\nWe consider a global system composed of internal\nsubsystems that are weakly and smoothly coupled to\ntheir own local and independent reservoirs. These couplings should respect typical Markov and Born approximations [22, 23]. We assume that the system is prepared\nin a given state (usually a pure state) and that it is not\ncorrelated to the environment at this stage. This can\n\nbe expressed as |\u03a8(0)i = |Si|Ei, with S and E (which\nwill be taken as the vacuum) designating system and environment initial states, respectively. Correlations arise\nas a result of the evolution\nP \u221a process that generically can\nbe given by |\u03a8(t)i = i pi |Si (t)i|Ei (t)i. However, in\nderiving the theoretical model one assumes that the environment is almost unaffected by the interaction (as a\nthermal bath, in our case at zero temperature) and that\nthe state \u03a8(t) presents correlations only to first order\nin the interaction coupling. Another important point is\nthat the environment quickly loses memory of its past\nhistory as compared to the time it takes for the system\nto evolve appreciably. The interaction Hamiltonian can\nbe written in the interaction picture under the rotating\nwave approximation as\ni\nX h\nHint =\ni \u03a0k b\u2020k (t) \u2212 \u03a0\u2020k bk (t) ,\n(1)\nk\n\nin which statistically Rindependent reservoirs are repre\u221e\nsented by bk (t) = \u221a12\u03c0 \u2212\u221e d\u03c9bk (\u03c9)e\u2212i(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9k )t , with b(\u03c9)\nthe environment many degrees of freedom labeled by frequencies \u03c9 and \u03a0k are system operators with characteristic frequencies \u03c9k . The coupling strength is already\nincluded in the definition of the system operators. The\nglobal state vector evolution can be given by the quantum stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation [24]\no\nXn\n(S) d|\u03a8(t)i =\n\u03a0k dBk\u2020 (t) \u2212 \u03a0\u2020k dBk (t) |\u03a8(t)i,\nk\n\n(2)\nwith the quantum\nwhite\nnoise\nor\nquantum\nWiener\nproRt\ncesses Bk (t) = 0 bk (s)ds. Therefore with independent\nMarkovian reservoirs initially at the vacuum state we\nhave the operator averages hdBk (t)dBl\u2020 (t0 )i = \u03b4kl \u03b4(t \u2212\nt0 )dt, and hdBk\u2020 (t)dBl (t0 )i = hdBk\u2020 (t)i = hdBk (t)i = 0.\nThis equation is in the Stratonovich form and it is convenient to convert it to the Ito form with the corresponding Ito rules dBk (t)dBl\u2020 (t0 ) = \u03b4kl \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 )dt, and\ndBk\u2020 (t)dBl (t0 ) = [dBk\u2020 (t)]2 = [dBk (t)]2 = 0, yielding\n\u001b\nX\u001a 1 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(I) d|\u03a8i =\n\u2212 \u03a0k \u03a0k dt + \u03a0k dBk \u2212 \u03a0k dBk |\u03a8i.\n2\nk\n(3)\nNow, if we are ignorant with respect to the environment\nand focus solely on the system properties our knowledge\nof the system is described by the reduced state \u03c1(t) =\ntrE {|\u03a8(t)ih\u03a8(t)|}, whose dynamics is given by the master\nequation\n\u001b\nX\u001a 1 \u2020\n\u2020\nd\u03c1 = L[\u03a0]\u03c1dt =\n\u2212 {\u03a0k \u03a0k , \u03c1} + \u03a0k \u03c1\u03a0k dt, (4)\n2\nk\n\nin which the over-line denotes an average over the reservoir. By ignoring the environment, either willingly or\nnot, we also lose information on the system and this evolution leads to loss of purity and entanglement of the\ninitially prepared state.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nMeasuring The Environment\n\nWe may choose to perform continuous selective measurements on the environment instead of averaging over\nit. By selectively collecting the measurement results\nwe acquire useful information. Take the initial state\n|\u03a8(0)i = |Si|0i, with the reservoir in the vacuum state\n(only one reservoir for simplicity) and assuming there\nis nonzero excitations in the system. If the interaction Hamiltonian Hint allows for excitation exchange,\nafter a very small time the global system evolves to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03a8(dt)i = p0 |S0 i|0i + p1 |S1 i|1i, with p1(0) the probability of one (no) excitation reaching the environment.\nThis can be seen by directly iterating equation\nwith\n\u221a (3), \u221a\n\u221a\n|S0 i = [11 \u2212 12 \u03a0\u2020 \u03a0dt]|Si/ p0 , and |S1 i = \u03a0 dt|Si/ p1 ,\nwith p1 = dthS|\u03a0\u2020 \u03a0|Si. Equation (4) gives us the system state \u03c1(dt) = p0 |S0 ihS0 | + p1 |S1 ihS1 |, while measuring the environment gives us |S0(1) i with probability\np0(1) . This corresponds to measuring the number operaRt\ntor in the environment d\u039b(t), with \u039b(t) = 0 b\u2020 (s)b(s)ds,\nwhose eigenvalues are the number of excitations counted\nin a time interval dt, one or zero excitations being the\nonly possibilities [24, 25]. Such measurement scheme\nis called a quantum jump unraveling [26]. In principle,\nthere are infinitely many other ways of observing the environment. In particular, one of them is the quadrature\noperator d\u0398 = (\u03a0\u2020 + \u03a0)dt + dB \u2020 (t) + dB(t) or homodyne\nmeasurement that gives rise to a diffusive unraveling [27].\nDiffusive unravelings are suitable in optics when one combines a system output with a classical local oscillator on\na beam splitter and measures the resulting output. They\narise naturally in condensed matter physics, for instance\nin quantum dot monitoring with a quantum point contact\nor single electron transistor [28], and are also very useful\nfor entanglement [29] and geometric phase [30] characterization in open quantum systems.\nThe quantum measurement results are, ultimately,\nclassical records and therefore can be expressed by classical (instead of quantum) stochastic processes. The\neigenvalues for the measurement operators are a Poisson process dN (t) for the quantum jump (where dN (t)\nassumes values 0 or 1) or, in the case of the diffusive unravellings, dQ(t) = h\u03a0\u2020 + \u03a0idt + dW (t), where\ndW (t) is a Wiener process [31]. Such processes obey\nthe usual Ito rules dNk (t)dNl (t0 ) = \u03b4kl \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 )dNk (t),\ndWk (t)dWl (t0 ) = \u03b4kl \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 )dt [32]. Thus, the conditional evolution of the system (where tilde indicates unnormalized state) can be written as a function of the\nmeasurement records\n\u001b\nX\u001a\nde\n\u03c1(t) =\nA\u03bek [\u03a0k ]dt + B\u03bek [\u03a0k ]d\u03bek (t) \u03c1e(t),\n(5)\nk\n\nwith \u03be(t) a classical stochastic function that records the\nmeasurement results, and represents the information we\nacquire from observing the environment. A\u03be [\u03a0] and\nB\u03be [\u03a0] are superoperators acting on the density matrix\nof the system. The operators \u03a0 can now be interpreted\n\nas a set of detectors surrounding the system in the environment. For a jump unraveling\nh we have AiNk [\u03a0k ]\u03c1 =\n\n\u2212 21 {\u03a0\u2020k \u03a0k , \u03c1}, and BNk [\u03a0k ]\u03c1 = \u03a0k \u03c1\u03a0\u2020k \u2212 11\u03c1 , with the\nPoisson process d\u03bek = dNk assuming the value one\nif the kth detector is triggered and zero if not, with\nmean value dN = h\u03a0\u2020 \u03a0idt. For a diffusive unraveling\nAQk [\u03a0k ] = L[\u03a0k ], and BQk [\u03a0k ]\u03c1 = \u03c1\u03a0\u2020k + \u03a0k \u03c1, with\nthe kth detector recording the intensity d\u03bek = dQk and\nthe Wiener process assuming any real value with a zero\nmean Gaussian distribution of width dt. Every detection apparatus suffers from imperfections, which leads to\na non unit efficiency \u03b7 not accounted for in the above\noperators. Including inefficiencies changes the jump unravelling into AN \u03b7k [\u03a0k ]\u03c1 = L[\u03a0k ]\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b7k \u03a0k \u03c1\u03a0\u2020k , with a\nconsequent decrease in the probability of triggering the\ndetectors reflected in the mean value dN = \u03b7h\u03a0\u2020 \u03a0idt.\nWhereas, the diffusive unraveling changes as dQk =\n\u221a\n\u03b7k h\u03a0\u2020k + \u03a0k idt + \u03b7k dW . This approach to inefficient\ndetection is based only on an information perspective, in\nthe sense that it describes an ability of distinguishing the\nresults that decreases with the efficiency. Realistic detection models can be found for specific systems in [33].\n\nB.\n\nInformation Feedback\n\nNow suppose that in a practical situation we wish for\nthe system to behave in a controlled way, for instance\nthat its state, either known or not, to be preserved. One\nstrategy for obtaining such control over the system is\nquantum feedback in which the observer acts on the system accordingly to the measurement outcomes [34, 35].\nGiven the outcomes d\u03be(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) at the time t \u2212 \u03c4 the feedback apparatus acts with a Hamiltonian proportional to\nan operator F at time t. The apparatus takes the delay\ntime \u03c4 to process the measurement result and activate\nthe feedback Hamiltonian. One straightforward way [34]\nof doing this is with a Hamiltonian linear in the mea)\nsurement outcomes Hfb = F d\u03be(t\u2212\u03c4\n. With the feedback\ndt\nacting after the measurement we have the evolution of the\nsystem given by (to be interpreted in the Ito calculus)\n(\nd\u03c1(t) =\n\neF d\u03be(t\u2212\u03c4 )\n\n)\n\u0015\n11 + A\u03be [\u03a0]dt + B\u03be [\u03a0]d\u03be(t) \u2212 11 \u03c1(t),\n\n\u0014\n\n(6)\nwith F\u03c1 = \u2212i[F, \u03c1].\nFor example, in the quantum jump scenario, the feedback acts unitarily and in a point like manner. For non\nunit measurement efficiency \u03b7 and nonzero feedback time\ndelay the dynamics will then be given by\n(\u0014\n)\n\u0015\nF\nde\n\u03c1(t) =\ne \u221211 dN (t\u2212\u03c4 )+Ldt+BN dN (t) \u03c1e(t)\u2212\u03b7\u03a0e\n\u03c1(t)\u03a0\u2020 dt.\n(7)\nWhereas, in the diffusive unraveling the dynamics will be\n\n\f4\nsince \u03a0\u2020 \u03a0 \u221d PC RR\u2020 PC = PC . Therefore, in a quantum jump unraveling, one can deterministically restore\nthe quantum data in the codspace with a direct feedback mechanism with Hamiltonian Hfb = F dN\ndt and recycling operation R = e\u2212iF , if the detection operator \u03a0\nobeys the above conditions. The feedback term in equation (7) can be identified with the reversing operation by\neF \u03c1 = R\u03c1 = R\u03c1R\u2020 .\nFIG. 1. Representation of the feedback loop.

First we choose a\nsubspace, a codespace, of the system to encode the logical qubits. The system is subjected to an environment\ninduced error E that can be represented in a short time\nP\nexpansion by E\u03c1 = [11 + Ldt]\u03c1 = i \u0393i \u03c1\u0393\u2020i . The system\ncan be recycled after errors have occurred if there exists\na recovery operation R such that RE\u03c1 = \u03c1 for all states\nin the codespace \u03c1 = PC \u03c1PC , with PC the projector onto\nthe codespace. We are interested in errors induced by\na Markovian environment, and for the simplest\n\u221a case we\nhave the errors \u03930 = 11 \u2212 21 \u03a0\u2020 \u03a0dt and \u03931 = \u03a0 dt. Standard error correction should then be applied as discrete\nactions over time intervals to be made very small and it\nhas to simultaneously correct for different errors \u0393i . By\nmeasuring and counting the excitations in the environment we can try to design specific recycling operations for\neach of the possible errors, moreover we can even choose\na codespace which is decoherence free with respect to at\nleast one error so we do not have to correct for all of\nthem. We find a codespace which is an eigenspace of the\n\u03930 operator and we have to recycle the system only when\na quantum jump occurs. We need to find an operation R\nthat reverses the quantum measurement and we choose\nto do it deterministically instead of probabilistically [36].\nLet us then recall the conditions for deterministic reversibility of a quantum jump [8, 37]. The recycling\noperation is an unitary R such that R\u03a0 \u221d PC (without loosing generality we neglect any effect of both the\nrecycling and jump operation outside the codespace),\ntherefore \u03a0 \u221d R\u2020 PC . Note that this implies that the\ncodespace has to be an eigenspace of the \u03930 operator\n\nFIG. 2. Representation of the local recycling process. The\nlogical qubits state is represented by the blue circle around\nthe qutrit states. The state is preserved while the system\ndoes not emit an excitation. When in does the encoded state\nshifts down the qutrit states and is recycled back to its original\nsubspace by the feedback action.\n\nNow we turn to the specific example of locally protecting quantum information against spontaneous emission. Suppose we have physical qutrits each with levels\n\u221a\n{|0i, |1i, |2i} with jump operators \u03a0 = \u03b3(|1ih2|+|0ih1|).\nIn such decay process, by detecting the emitted excitations, we cannot tell which of the qutrit's levels decayed. This is a very important condition for the protocol to work. Another favorable condition is that the\ndecay rates of transitions |2i 7\u2192 |1i and |1i 7\u2192 |0i be\nthe same \u03b3. In the long run all states are then dragged\nto the ground state. Is there a subspace in which the\nquantum jump can be reversed? The answer is affirmative with the codespace being {|1i, |2i}. To corroborate this one just needs to compute \u03a0\u2020 \u03a0 = \u03b3PC , with\nPC = |1ih1| + |2ih2|. The recycling operation is then\ngiven by R = \u221a1\u03b3 \u03a0\u2020 + |0ih2| and the feedback operator\nF = \u03bb[ \u221a1\u03b3 (\u03a0\u2020 \u2212 \u03a0) + |0ih2| \u2212 |2ih0|] with \u03bb \u2248 1, 2092i.\nThis reversing operation clearly feeds the system back\nwith one excitation after it has decayed. Information is\nthen preserved in the codespace while the detector is not\ntriggered. As the system evolves it eventually decays and\nthe qutrit state might partially or completely leave the\ncodespace. Then the detector is triggered and the feedback mechanism activated, and the system is recycled\nback to the original state. If the measurement is completely efficient and the feedback time delay is null then\nthe logical qubit is locally and perfectly protected from\nits coupling to the environment. The recycling process\nis illustrated in fig. (2). Now suppose we had n qutrits,\neach with its own recycling process, then we could protect\n\n\f5\nany state in the codespace {|1i, |2i}\u2297n , thus protecting\nn logical qubits encoded into n individual qutrits.\n\nB.\n\nQuantum State Diffusion\n\nWe can start analyzing imperfections in the recycling\nprotocol by looking at a very important sort of inefficiency that manifests itself as additional noise in the measurement records, either intentionally added or not by the\nobserver, with the measurement process corresponding to\na diffusive unraveling. We refer to the diffusive limit as an\ninefficient limit since the additional classical noise erases\npart of the information regarding the underlying interaction process between system and environment, which is\nan excitation exchange. In the jump limit we are clearly\ninformed whether there has been an excitation exchange\nor not, and this is not the case in the diffusive limit. However we may also state that we are changing the way we\ndetect the error syndromes by changing the way we measure and acquire information from the environment, and\nthen we show that to reach error correction the encoding\nand the feedback Hamiltonian are also modified. Therefore the diffusion based recycling is different to the jump\nbased and represents a different error correction code on\nits own.\nSome goals were shown to be possibly achieved with\nquantum state diffusion such as stabilization of an arbitrary (but known) pure qubit state [38] and even global\nerror correction [13] (relying on global encoding and\nglobal recovery operations). We show that it is impossible to perfectly protect an arbitrary unknown qubit state\nencoded in a physical qubit. However, by introducing the\nqutrit encoding we can achieve error correction for a logical qubit encoded in the qutrit. Furthermore, we globally\nprotect an arbitrary unknown multi-qubit state from its\ninteraction with the environment through local diffusion\nbased feedback.\nIn the diffusive limit the unconditioned feedback master equation reads (with perfect measurement and feedback)\nd\u03c1 = \u2212\n\n\u0003\ni\u0002 \u2020\n\u03a0 F + F \u03a0, \u03c1 dt + L[\u03a0 \u2212 iF ]\u03c1dt,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nand to protect an arbitrary state one needs to add a\nconstant driving Hamiltonian H = \u2212 12 (\u03a0\u2020 F + F \u03a0) to\ncancel the first term and to find an appropriate feedback\nHamiltonian F that cancels the source of decoherence in\nthe second term. The jump operator can be written as\n\u03a0 = M + X + iY , with M a multiple of the identity\nand X and Y are Hermitian operators. In the particular case of spontaneous emission we have M = 0 and X\nand Y as the renormalized angular\nmomentum operators\n\u221a\n\u03b3\nfor the physical qutrit X = 2 (|1ih2| + |0ih1| + h.c.) and\n\u221a\n\u03b3\nY = 2 (\u2212i|1ih2| \u2212 i|0ih1| + h.c.). Now suppose that the\ncodespace has some stabilizer operator S, which means\nthat the codespace is an eigenspace of S with eigenvalue\n\n+1. Then the appropriate feedback would be given by\nF = Y \u2212 iXS such that L[\u03a0 \u2212 iF ] = L[M + X(11 \u2212 S)],\nand thus the codespace is annihilated by (11 \u2212 S) and is\npreserved throughout the evolution. However, the feedback Hamiltonian must be Hermitian and hence S must\nanti-commute with X, SX + XS = 0 [13]. In the qubit\ncase the only local stabilizer would be the identity operator which does not anti-commute with any other operator\nand thus it is impossible to find the feedback Hamiltonian and perfectly protect one qubit with diffusion based\nfeedback.\nC\n|2>\n\n|2>\n\n|1>\n\n|1>\n\n|0>\n\n|0>\n\nF\n\nFIG. 3. Representation of the local recycling process. The\nlogical qubit state is encoded in the blue region around the\nqutrit states. The system suffers infinitesimal errors continuously and the state is damaged in an irregular way, such\nthat part of the information leaves the codespace and the remaining part is also disrupted. Then the error is detected (for\nexample, by homodyne measurements in optical systems) and\nthe feedback mechanism is activated and the state is recycled\nback to its original subspace by the feedback action.\n\nIn the qutrit case it is possible to find a useful stabilizer that anti-commutes with the X angular momentum\noperator. The stabilizer is then defined by S|0i = |0i,\nS|2i = |2i, and S|1i = \u2212|1i, and thus the codespace is\n{|0i, |2i} with PC = |0ih0| + |2ih2|. The recycling process goes as follows (see also figure 3). In a very short\ntime interval the detectors register the measurement outcome dQ(t) and the\n\u0002 system state evolves\u0003 accordingly as\n|SQ (t + dt)i = 11 \u2212 21 \u03a0\u2020 \u03a0dt + \u03a0dQ(t) |SQ (t)i, which\ndamages the initial state. However, immediately after the\ndetection the feedback mechanism is triggered and the\nabove state is multiplied by the feedback R = e\u2212iF dQ(t) ,\nthus the system actual evolution is\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1 \u2020\n1\n|SQ (t + dt)i = 11 \u2212\n\u03a0 \u03a0 \u2212 i (\u03a0\u2020 F + F \u03a0) + iF \u03a0\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0015\n2\nF\n+\ndt + (\u03a0 \u2212 iF ) dQ(t) |SQ (t)i\n2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u03b3dt\n= 11 \u2212\n+ XdQ (11 \u2212 S) |SQ (t)i.\n2\nNow, as we defined the appropriate feedback hamiltonian\nand stabilizer, it is easy to see that if the initial state\nis inside the codespace (PC |SQ (t)i = |SQ (t)i) then it\nremains in the codespace |SQ (t + dt)i = |SQ (t)i, since\nthe term with the stabilizer S annihilates the codespace\n(11 \u2212 S)|SQ i = 2(11 \u2212 PC )|SQ i = 0.\n\n\f6\n\nC.\n\nInefficiencies\n\nNow we analyze the performance of the protocol subjected to inefficiencies. Since the error detection relies\non measuring the environment the protocol heavily depends on the measurement efficiency. The feedback time\ndelay must be significantly smaller than the decay time\notherwise the systems dissipates before the feedback action. The measurement time resolution dt must be much\nsmaller than the decay time although it has to be grater\nthan the reservoir characteristic correlation time. We focus the analysis on the jump based code since it presents\ninteresting effects on single realizations.\nIt is clear that global resources such as entanglement\ncan also be locally preserved by the recycling protocol. Therefore, distant parties on a quantum network\ncan sustain entangled states against the environmental action and perform quantum communication protocols such as teleportation [39] and dense coding [40].\nFor such purpose using robust states would increase the\ncommunication efficiency. For instance, states that do\nnot suffer from entanglement sudden death. W type\nstates are know to be highly robust and in our recycling\nprotocol they would take the forms of |12i + |21i and\n|112i+|121i+|211i for two and three qutrits respectively.\nThere is an interesting mechanism that makes such states\nrobust against finite feedback time delay. Let us examine the simplest case with an initial state |12i + |21i and\na feedback time delay \u03c4 . Suppose that an excitation is\nemitted and detected from the first qutrit and the state\njumps to |02i+|11i partially leaving the codespace. Now,\nthis state evolves as |02i + e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 /2 |11i while the feedback\naction is delayed, and when it does act the state is put\nback into the codespace |12i + e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 /2 |21i although not\ncompletely restored. Now, if an excitation is detected\nfrom the second qutrit the state evolves and by the end\nof the delay time it is again a maximally entangled state\ne\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 /2 [|11i + |20i], and then it is finally restored by the\nfeedback. Thus the undesirable evolution that takes place\nduring the feedback delay on one of the qutrits can be\nreversed by the delay on another qutrit. This is the best\npossible situation given the time delay.

As shown in the fig-\n\n0.95\n0.9\n\nEN\n\nTherefore, as in the case of quantum jump based feedback, the encoding into qutrits allows for local actions to\nfully protect n-qubit states, but now with a diffusive environment measurement and the codespace {|0i, |2i}\u2297n .\nHowever the diffusion based recycling can be more sensitive to inefficiencies as compared to the jump based one,\nat least in single realizations. When we consider inefficiencies, for instance in the feedback time delay, the\ntrajectories become highly irregular. This behavior is a\nmanifestation of the lack of information in the diffusive\nunraveling which induces degradation of entanglement.\nIn fact diffusive unravelings are also know to minimize\nthe average entanglement when we average over trajectories [29].\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.8\n0\n\n0\n\n0.75\n0.7\n\n1\n\n2\nat\n\n0.05\n3\n\n4 0.1\n\n0.65\n\nao\n\nFIG. 5.

It is easy to see that states like\n|11i + |22i would only be degraded by a time delay.\nThe protocol is much more affected by measurement\ninefficiencies as can be seen in fig. 6. The no jump evolution starts to resemble the unconditioned master equation evolution as the measurement efficiency decreases. It\npopulates the ground state component and decreases the\nquantum coherence and entanglement in the codespace.\nAs a consequence the recycling process becomes less and\nless effective as the efficiency decreases. Still an interesting effect which is what makes the protocol effective at\nsmall inefficiencies is that when a jump occurs (followed\nby feedback) the ground state component is eliminated\nwhich increases both population and coherence in the\ncodespace leading to an entanglement leap (this effect\n\n\f7\nalso played an important role in elucidating a quantum\nclassical transition [41]).

There is no closed expression for\nthe entanglement (of formation) of such states. Here we\nchoose to plot the negativity [42] as an upper bound to\nthe distillable entanglement. For the sake of comparison\nwe plot the negativity in all the figures.\nWe have stated earlier that the indistinguishability of\nthe decay channels of the qutrit is of extreme importance for the error correction to work. Now, we relax this constraint and look at the protocol effectiveness as the transitions become more and more distinguishable. The single detection\noperator \u03a0\n\u221a is split into\u0003\n\u221a \u0002\u221a\ntwo other detectors, \u03a02 = \u03b3 \u03b1|1ih2| + 1 \u2212 \u03b1|0ih1|\n\u0003\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0002\u221a\nand \u03a01 = \u03b3 1 \u2212 \u03b1|1ih2| + \u03b1|0ih1| , each one corresponding to one of the transitions. If \u03b1 = 1/2 the transitions are indistinguishable and if \u03b1 = 1 (or zero) the\ntransitions are perfectly distinguishable. Note that by\nchanging the distinguishability we also change the overall dynamics (not just the measurement process), such\nthat for \u03b1 6= 1/2 we have L[\u03a0] 6= L[\u03a01 ] + L[\u03a02 ], however\nfor \u03b1 = 1/2 we have L[\u03a0] = L[\u03a01 ]+L[\u03a02 ]. After both detectors are triggered the same feedback action is applied.\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\nat\n\n3\n\n3\n\n`\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n4 4\n\nFIG. 9. Average entanglement (negativity) of the jump feedback as a function of time and the transition rate \u03b2.\n\nEven though the transitions may be indistinguishable\nthe transition rates may differ, which makes one of them\nmore probable than the other. This is the case in harmonic oscillators, for instance. Generically\nthe jump op\u221a \u221a\nerator would be given by \u03a0 = \u03b3[ \u03b2|1ih2|+|0ih1|], yielding a probability for the transition |2i \u2192 |1i proportional\nto \u03b2. When the rates are unbalanced the no jump (or\nno detection) evolution disturbs the chosen codespace,\nwhich means that our strategy could be combined with\na \"bang-bang\" error correction protocol [43, 44] to protect the logical qubits (although we do not apply the\n\"bang-bang\" control). Furthermore, the jump evolution\nalso disrupts the encoded information in addition to taking it outside the codespace. As the upper transition\n\n\f8\nbecomes more and more probable the protocol becomes\nless effective. However, for unbalanced transition rates\ncorresponding to harmonic oscillators (\u03b2 = 2) the protocol is still able to protect a considerable amount of\nentanglement, as shown in fig. (9).\nAnother possible imperfection in the feedback mechanism is an imprecision in the implementation of the\nrecycling operation, such as a fluctuating Hamiltonian\nstrength as in a disorder effect. For instance the Hamiltonian could be given by the ideal one with a strength which\nassumes Gaussian distributed values around the ideal\nvalue \u03bb each time the feedback is triggered. The disordered feedback Hamiltonian would be given by (1 + \u03bb\u03b4 )F ,\nwith \u03b4 a Gaussian distributed random variable with zero\nmean. This disorder effect amounts to a non perfect recycling operation that is subjected to random imperfections\nand it is given by a one parameter family of random unitary matrices: the ideal operation times a one parame\u03b4\nter family Re\u2212iF \u03bb . This disorder recycling process often\ndoes not restore the state back to the codespace since\nthe disordered matrices may differ considerably (for an\nappreciable variance of the disorder distribution var(\u03b4))\nfrom the ideal, thus leading to a degradation of global resources during periods in which the system ceases emission. We show the average negativity in fig. (10). It can\nbe seen that the protocol tolerates small fluctuations in\nthe Hamiltonian and we believe this disorder effect to be\nnot as significant as measurement inefficiency and time\ndelay, although for higher disorder the effect would be\nfar more damaging than a time delay since the average\nentanglement decreases approximately linearly with the\ntime delay and presents a decreasing curvature with the\ndisorder.\n\n0.95\n1\n0.9\n\nEN\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n0\n\n0.7\n0\n\n0.8\n2\n\n0.05\nvar(b)\n\n0.1 4\n\nat\n\nFIG. 10.

The idea\nis based on cascade decay and the indistinguishability\nof the excitations emitted by different decay channels.\nHowever, one could ask what happens when those channels are completely distinguishable and therefore entanglement cannot be protected by the local recycling protocol. In this session we address this issue by looking at the\ndynamics of entanglement of 3 \u2297 3 systems for different\ninternal structures. Note that in our analysis, each system will always be subjected to two independent decay\nchannels. As we have seen, for a decaying qubit the only\npossible structure for the decaying channel is a transition\nfrom the excited state to the ground state and the only\npossible behaviors of the disentanglement dynamics are\nan asymptotic or a sudden death of entanglement [45].\nWe show in this session that for qutrits, on the other\nhand, the picture is richer and may present asymptotic\nentanglement even under the action of local independent\nreservoirs.\nWe study three different distinguishable decay channel\nconfigurations for the qutrits:\n1) The cascade or E structure with jump operators\n\u221a\nE1 = \u03b31 |0ih1|\n\u221a\nE2 = \u03b32 |1ih2|\n(10)\n2) the V structure with\n\u221a\nV1 = \u03b31 |0ih1|\n\u221a\nV2 = \u03b32 |0ih2|\n\n(11)\n\n3) the \u039b configuration with\n\u221a\n\u039b1 = \u03b31 |0ih2|\n\u221a\n\u039b2 = \u03b32 |1ih2|\n\n(12)\n\nas shown in Fig. 11.\nAs we show bellow, different configurations will present\ndifferent dynamics. Before we proceed, please note that,\nthroughout the analysis we will always consider independent reservoirs of the same strength, \u03b31 = \u03b32 , with no\nloss of generality (all the important ingredients already\nshow up in this simple case) and reservoir detectors that\nare able to distinguish photons emitted by each internal\ntransition hence avoiding the addition of any externally\ninduced entanglement in the system. Finally, we also focus on initial states of the form |\u03c8i = a|00i+b|11i+c|22i\n(where a, b and c are real numbers and a 6= b 6= c 6= 0 for\nsimplicity), which, once again, with no loss of generality,\nalready present all the interesting features in qutrit-qutrit\ndisentanglement.\nPrevious works have introduced the possible elements\nof the dynamics of disentanglement in 3 \u2297 3 systems under dissipation such as precursors of sudden death, sudden death of distillability, and asymptotic decay [21].

Again, as in previous cases, the presence of those elements also depend on the initial state.\nWe summarize bellow the relations between the decaying\nstructure, the initial state, and the resulting general aspects of the disentanglement dynamics for each internal\nstructure (and show some examples in Fig. 12):\n1. in cascade - cascade structure: (a) aymptotic decay\nfor a > b > c, (b) one sudden change followed by\nasymptotic decay for b > a > c or a > c > b,\n(c) two sudden changes and asymptotic decay for\nb > c > a, and (d) two sudden changes and sudden\ndeath for c > b > a;\n2. in V - V structure: (a) aymptotic decay for a > b\nand a > c, (b) one sudden change and asymptotic\ndecay for a > b and a < c, and (c) two sudden\nchanges and asymptotic decay for a < b and a < c;\n3. in \u039b - \u039b: (a) asymptotic decay with asymptotic entanglement for 2a > c and 2b > c, (b) one sudden\nchange and asymptotic decay with asymptotic entanglement for 2a > c and 2b < c with c2 < 4ab,\n(c) two sudden change and asymptotic decay for\n2a > c and 2b < c with c2 > 4ab, and (d) two\nsudden change and sudden death for 2a < c and\n2b < c.\nWe also show the negative eigenvalues of the partial\ntransposition of the density matrix for some examples,\nrecalling that a sudden change occurs every time one of\nthe negative eigenvalues becomes non negative (fig. 13).\nIn all the cases we study, entanglement is measured by\nnegativity which for 3 \u2297 3 systems estimates the amount\nof free entanglement available in the system [46]. The\nfirst striking feature present in Fig. 12 is that in the\n\u039b \u2212 \u039b configuration, entanglement may not decay to zero\nbut to a non-null value, depending on the initial state (if\nc2 < 4ab). This interesting property can be explained\nby the fact that there is indeed an entangled dark state\nin this configuration, composed of the superposition of\nthe product of the lower states in each part, which is not\naffected by the dissipative dynamics.\nAnother interesting feature is that in the V structure\nonly when b or c = 0 the system may present entanglement sudden death. In this case, we have effectively a\ntwo-qubit system, given that one of the upper levels of\neach qutrit is initialy not populated and, at least for zero\n\nNegativity\n\n1\na>b>c\nV\n0.5\n\nb>a>c\nc>b>a\n\n0\n0\n\n1\nat\n\n2\n\nFIG. 12.

Incidently, E and V configuration present the same effective Hamiltonian, consequently, the same dynamics. For the initial states under\nconsideration, the non-normalized state and the negativity are respectively given by |\u03c8\u0303(t)i = a|00i + be\u22122\u03b3t |11i +\nce\u22122\u03b3t |22i and\n2\n(abe\u22122\u03b3t + ace\u22122\u03b3t + bce\u22124\u03b3t ).\n+\n+ c2 )e\u22124\u03b3t\n(14)\nIn such no-jump trajectories there is also an effect reminiscent of the optimum singlet state conversion for\nqubits [18]. Starting with a non maximally entangled\nstate there is the possibility of increasing entanglement\nbefore it reaches the asymptotic value. But now the system may attain higher values of entanglement since it is\na qutrit-qutrit and not a qubit-qubit system (fig. (14)).\nThe \u039b structure on the oder hand presents a different\neffective Hamiltonian. In this case not only it is possible\nto increase the entanglement by measurement, but there\nis also the possibility of reaching an asymptotic entangled\nstate. The no-jump evolution is given by |\u03c8\u0303(t)i = a|00i+\nb|11i + ce\u22124\u03b3t |22i and the negativity is then\nEN =\n\na2\n\n(b2\n\nEN = 2\n\nab + (a + b)ce\u22124\u03b3t\n.\n1 + c2 (e\u22128\u03b3t \u2212 1)\n\nfact, replace them with a transient increase of entanglement followed by an asymptotic preservation of entanglement through only local operations.\n2\nCascade and V\nR\nCascade and V\nR\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\nNegativity\n\nNaturally, if the temperature of the reservoir is different\nfrom zero then the system is incoherently pumped and\nentanglement dies in finite time.\nMuch in the same way as in the previous sessions, we\ncan also analyze the effects of continuous monitoring of\nthe reservoirs in the dynamics of the entanglement of\nthe system, now as a function of the configuration of the\nlevels. However, this time we only focus on no jump\ntrajectories since all transition-emitted photons are distinguishable and a single decay completely identifies the\nquantum state of the decaying qutrit and definitely kills\nentanglement.

In particular, we have shown that in the photon detection limit the\nencoding is particularly sensitive to the efficiency of the\nmeasurement process, whereas quite robust against time\ndelay in the feedback mechanism and very robust against\nfluctuations in the feedback interaction. We have also\nstudied the limit corresponding to homodyne detection\nand have shown that the encoding in qutrits allows for\na certain degree of protection of the initial entanglement\nwhich is not possible at all in this regime if the qubits are\nencoded in two-level systems. Finally, we have analyzed\nthe scenario in which the decay channels are orthogonal,\nhence single clicks already kill the entanglement of the\nsystem. We have studied different qutrit configurations\nand we have shown that in some of them the no jump\ntrajectory may still preserve entanglement even asymptotically in time due to the presence of decoherence free\nsubspaces in the system.\n\n(15)\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nIn the asymptotic limit the negativity is N (t \u2192 \u221e) =\n2ab\na2 +b2 . Note that, this behavior does not depend on decay rates. The asymptotic entanglement in no-jump and\nunconditional dynamics occurs because the \u039b structure\npresents a 2\u22972 decoherence free subspace (|00i, |01i, |10i\nand |11i), as a two-qubit system (figure (14)). The simple monitoring scheme is then able to prevent the abrupt\nchanges, including sudden death of distillability, and in\n\nWe would like to acknowledge D.
