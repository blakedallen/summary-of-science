We discuss the\nanalogous phenomena in the higher dimensional cases, developing a relation between fuzzy\nSO(2k)/U (k) cosets and unitary Lie algebras.\nNov 2001\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\nFuzzy spheres of dimension higher than two have found a variety of physical appli-\n\ncations [1][2][3][4][5] and may be relevant to the ADS/CFT correspondence [6][7][8][9]. In\nthis paper we will study some geometrical aspects of the matrix algebras which are related\nto these higher fuzzy spheres. This will allow us to observe some interesting features associated with the physics of fluctuations around solutions of brane actions involving these\nfuzzy spheres.\nIn section two we review some background on higher dimensional fuzzy spheres. Fuzzy\nspheres are described by looking for an N \u00d7 N matrix realization of the equation\n2k+1\nX\n\nX\u03bc X\u03bc = 1,\n\n\u03bc=1\n\nwhich classically describes a sphere. The X\u03bc matrices transform in the vector representation of SO(2k + 1) symmetry group of the sphere. The decomposition of the matrix\nalgebras into irreducible representations of SO(2k + 1) is reviewed. It has been pointed\nout that only a subset of these representations approaches the space of spherical harmonics\non a classical sphere [10]. This raises the issue of the geometry of the large N limit of the\nfull matrix algebra. Some relevant mathematical results in harmonic analysis are noted,\nwhich indicate that the relevant space is SO(2k + 1)/U (k).\nIn section three we describe some aspects of the system of algebraic equations obeyed\nby the generators of the matrix algebra. The X\u03bc 's are among the generators and they\nare obtained from the action of gamma matrices \u0393\u03bc of SO(2k + 1) on Sym(V \u2297n ), an\nirreducible representation of SO(2k + 1) obtained by symmetrizing the n-fold tensor power\nof the fundamental spinor. This representation is N dimensional where N \u223c nk(k+1) , and\n\nthe X \u03bc are N \u00d7 N matrices. The matrix algebra is denoted as \u00c2n (S 2k ). While the X\u03bc\n\ndo generate \u00c2n (S 2k ) under matrix multiplication at finite n, consideration of the large n\n\nlimit indicates that it is useful to introduce extra generators transforming in antisymmetric\ntensor representations of SO(2k + 1), and obeying some constraint equations. We describe\nfurther geometrical structures on \u00c2n (S 2k ), namely an algebra of derivations SO(2k + 1, 1).\nIt is useful to distinguish the matrix algebra \u00c2n (S 2k ) from a subspace An (S 2k ) which\n\ndecomposes into symmetric traceless representations of SO(2k+1). This subspace An (S 2k )\n\nhas a non-associative multiplication which becomes associative in the large N limit [10].\nIt is shown that SO(2k + 1) acts as derivations of this non-associative algebra. Further\nproperties of An (S 2k ) are developed in the Appendix.\n1\n\n\fIn section four we consider, in detail, the fuzzy four-sphere. We show that the large\nn limit of \u00c2n (S 4 ) describes the algebra of functions on SO(5)/U (2). This is done by\n\nconsidering a special solution to the system of equations obeyed by the generators of\nthe matrix algebra in the large N limit. Rather than writing out all the equations and\nlooking for solutions, we use the simple fact that the explicit matrix construction of the\ngenerators should give solutions to the equations. Following the relation between operators\nand classical variables in quantum mechanics, we obtain these solutions by considering\nthe expectation values of these generators in a state. Given the solution, we find its\nstabilizer group to be U (2). Since the system of equations obeyed by the generators is\nSO(5) covariant, the special solution generates SO(5)/U (2). The harmonics on this space\ncoincide with the large N decomposition of the matrix algebra, thus showing that the\nmatrix algebra , \u00c2n (S 4 ), approaches the space of functions on this coset.\n\nThe coset SO(5)/U (2) is a bundle over S 4 with fibre which is a two-sphere. We\n\ndescribe a finite n version of this bundle structure, with the fibre being a fuzzy two-sphere.\nThe connection between the fuzzy two-sphere and U (n + 1) is exploited to show that the\nantisymmetric generators Xij which generate the algebra of functions on the fibre can be\nassociated with field strengths of a U (n + 1) bundle at a point on the S 4 . In this way,\nwe establish a direct relation, by construction so to speak, between the matrix description\nof the worldvolume theory of N \u223c n3 /6 D0 branes with the field strengths of the dual\n\ninstanton description in terms of U (n + 1) gauge theory with N \u223c n3 /6 instantons on\nthe worldvolume of n + 1 spherical 4-branes, a connection expected on general physical\ngrounds [2][4].\nIn section five and six we develop analogous points for the fuzzy S 6 and the fuzzy\nS 8 . This uses an extension of the connection between unitary Lie algebras and fuzzy twospheres [11] to connections between unitary Lie algebras and SO(2k)/U (k) for k = 3, 4.\nThis is expected to generalize to any k.\nIn section seven, we observe that fluctuations of branes described in the fuzzy sphere\nconstructions have in addition to a description in terms of non-Abelian gauge theory on\nspheres with a large number of instantons, a description in terms of a field theory on the\nSO(2k +1)/U (k) coset. The field theory has symmetries which include a non-commutative\nU (1) gauge symmetry and a global SO(2k + 1) symmetry. A complete understanding of\nthe higher dimensional action is left for the future.\nIn the Appendix we show that the non-associative algebra An (S 2k ) is actually com-\n\nmutative at finite n. If all O(1/n) terms are dropped from the structure constants, the\n2\n\n\falgebra is commutative and associative and coincides with the algebra of spherical harmonics. If O(1/n) terms are kept, and O(1/n2 ) terms are dropped, then the algebra is an\ninfinite dimensional Jordan Algebra. At higher orders in 1/n and at finite n, it is a more\ngeneral commutative and non-associative algebra which is not Jordan. For concreteness\nthese points are developed for the case k = 2 but the arguments are of a general nature.\n\n2.\n\nReview of relevant background\nHere we will review some material from physics and mathematics literature which will\n\nbe useful.\n2.1. Fuzzy spheres and matrix brane constructions\nThe fuzzy four-sphere was used in the construction of time-dependent 4-brane solutions from the action of zero-branes in [2], in the context of Matrix Theory of BFSS. On\nthe other hand, the Lagrangian for a matrix model coupled to totally antisymmetric tensor\nfield of rank (2k + 1) is of the form [12]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\n[\u03a6\u03bc , \u03a6\u03bd ] + F \u01eb\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2k+1 \u03a6\u03bc1 * * * \u03a6\u03bc2k+1 ,\nL = Tr\n2\nwhere F is the field strength. An example of this was found by Myers [12] that D0branes expand into spherical branes in the background of RR gauge fields. Along similar\nlines, one considers the worldvolume action for D-strings ending on D5-branes and in this\ncase 5 matrices transverse to the D-string worldvolume describe the end-point acquiring\na spherical 4-dimensional geometry[4]. A discussions of fuzzy spheres in Matrix theory\nalso appears in [13]. A different application involves the study of compactifications of\nM-theory in the context of matrix model compactified on a (2k + 1)-dimensional sphere.\nThe Lagrangian is of the form\nL = Tr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n2\n2\n[\u03a6\u03bc , \u03a6\u03bd ] \u2212 a(\u03a6\u03bc \u03a6\u03bc \u2212 R ) ,\n2\n\nwhere a is the Lagrange multiplier. The X\u03bc which are used to construct fuzzy sphere\ncoordinates in the next section can be used to solve the equations of motion in all of the\nabove cases by setting \u03a6\u03bc = LX\u03bc for some constant L.\nSince the algebra of functions of X is equivalent to the algebra of N \u00d7 N matrices, in\n\nthese cases, generic configurations of the matrix variables can be described as fields living on\n3\n\n\fa manifold whose algebra of functions is approximated by the large N limit of \u00c2n (S 2k ). In\nthis paper, we will describe this manifold, and relate its finite n non-commutative geometry\n\nto non-Abelian gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere. The rank and instanton number of the\ngauge bundle are both related to N which sets the scale of non-commutativity, so these\nconstructions are far from simply being discretized versions of spheres.\n2.2. Decomposing matrix algebras into reps. of SO(2k + 1)\nThe construction of fuzzy spheres S 2k starts with the action of X\u03bc , \u03bc = 1 * * * 2k + 1,\n\nwhich are obtained from an action of \u0393\u03bc on Sym(V \u2297n ):\nX\u03bc =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc ).\n\n(2.1)\n\nr=1\n\nThe operator \u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc ) acts on the r-th copy of V in V \u2297n . Since the sum (2.1) is symmetric it\ngives a well defined action on Sym(V \u2297n ). Each X\u03bc is an N \u00d7N matrix where N \u223c nk(k+1)\n\nat large n. Products of the X\u03bc generate the full set of matrices. Different products can\n\nbe used to generate sets of matrices transforming according to different representations\nof SO(2k + 1). Each tensor representation occurs once, with a cutoff on the first row of\nthe Young diagram corresponding to the representation of r1 \u2264 n. With this cutoff, the\ndimensions of these representations add up to N 2 , exactly the size of the matrix algebra\n\n[10]. In the large n limit, all representations of SO(2k + 1) occur with unit multiplicity.\nThe algebra of functions on the sphere S 2k decomposes into representations which are\nsymmetric and traceless, i.e they correspond to Young diagrams with row lengths ri = 0\nfor i > 1. To get this algebra we have to project out the representations which have\nany columns of length greater than 1. On this projected space we have a non-associative\nmultiplication.\nIn this paper we will be focusing on the geometry of the full matrix algebra. Since the\nmatrix algebra has a simple decomposition into representations of SO(2k + 1), this can be\nexpected to give some strong hints about the geometry related to it.\n2.3. A heuristic guess\nThe operators X\u03bc have eigenvalues ranging from \u2212n to n. The number of degrees of\n\nfreedom in the matrix algebra grows like N 2 which is nk(k+1) . If we think of the space\n\ndescribed by the full matrix algebra as a discretized space and associate one degree of\nfreedom with each point, we expect the space to be k(k + 1) dimensional. This will indeed\nbe the dimension of the coset space SO(2k + 1)/U (k) which we will prove to have an\nalgebra of functions which is the classical limit of the matrix algebra.\n4\n\n\f2.4. The results of Kramer\nA paper of Kramer [14] has done the job of finding the space whose algebra of functions contains each representation of SO(2k + 1) once. It is the space SO(2k + 1)/U (k).\nThis space has dimension k(k + 1). The construction of algebras which contain each representation of SO(2k + 1) is not in fact unique. Such constructions are referred to as model\nspaces, and they can also come up as spaces of sections of certain bundles over cosets [15].\nTo establish that our matrix algebra is indeed associated with SO(2k + 1)/U (k) we will\ndescribe the system of equations obeyed by these matrices in the large n limit.\n\n3.\n\nDescription in terms of algebraic equations\n\n3.1. Explicit form of gamma matrices\nTo fix notation we will give the form of the gamma matrices \u0393\u03bc with \u03bc = 1 * * * 2k + 1.\nThe gamma matrices of SO(2k + 1) obey the equations :\n{\u0393\u03bc , \u0393\u03bd } = 2\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThey can be expressed in terms of a set of fermionic oscillators ai with i running from 1\nto k, and obeying\n{ai , a\u2020j } = \u03b4ij .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe expressions for the gamma matrices are :\n\u03932i\u22121 = (ai + a\u2020i ),\n\u03932i = i(ai \u2212 a\u2020i )\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , k and \u03932k+1 = \u03931 * * * \u03932k .\nA 2k dimensional representation of the \u0393 matrix algebra is obtained by defining a\nstate |0i which is annihilated by the fermionic annihilation operators ai and acting with\n\nthe creation operators to generate 2k different states.\n5\n\n\f3.2. Algebra of the fuzzy sphere\nFrom the matrices describing the fuzzy spheres, we can write down a set of algebraic\nequations which are satisfied by the variables. In the large n limit all the variables involved\nare commutative.\nFor a fuzzy sphere define X\u03bc as in (2.1). Let us denote their commutators by\nX\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1X\n1\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bc ).\n[X\u03bc , X\u03bd ] =\n2\n2 r\n\n(3.4)\n\nFor the fuzzy 6-sphere we also need the totally antisymmetrized cubic products of gamma\nmatrices:\n\n1\n\nX\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb =\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393[\u03bc \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bb] )\n\nr\n\n=\n\nX\nr\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bb + \u0393\u03bb \u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bd + \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bb \u0393\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bb \u2212 \u0393\u03bb \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bb \u0393\u03bd )\n\nand similarly, for the fuzzy-8-sphere, we will also need\nX\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393[\u03bc \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bb \u0393\u03c1] ).\n\n(3.6)\n\nr\n\nThese matrices satisfy the following algebraic relations:\nX\u03bc X\u03bc = c,\n\n(3.7)\n\n[X\u03bc\u03bd , X\u03c1 ] = 2(\u03b4\u03bd\u03c1 X\u03bc \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03c1 X\u03bd ),\n\n(3.8)\n\n[X\u03bc\u03bd , X\u03ba\u03c1 ] = 2(\u03b4\u03bd\u03ba X\u03bc\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03bc\u03c1 X\u03bd\u03ba \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03ba X\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03c1 X\u03bc\u03ba ),\n\n(3.9)\n\nc = n(n + 2k).\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere\n\nThe X\u03bc\u03bd 's can be identified with generators of the SO(2k + 1) Lie algebra. Together with\nX\u03bc , they generate the Lie algebra of SO(2k + 1, 1).\nIn addition, we have generalized self-duality relations\n\u01eb\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2k+1 X\u03bc1 * * * X\u03bc2k = \u03bbX\u03bc2k+1 .\n1\n\n(3.11)\n\nThey are not antisymmetric cubic products of X\u03bc 's, but are more complicated functions of\n\nthem.\n\n6\n\n\fThis relation is valid only when they are viewed as operators on Sym(V \u2297n ). For k = 1,\n\u03bb = 2. For k = 2, \u03bb = 8(n + 2). For k = 3, \u03bb = 144n(n2 + 4).\nTo describe the geometry corresponding to this algebra, we define variables Z\u03bc , Z\u03bc\u03bd ,\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb , Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 , which satisfy algebraic equations with real coefficients and they generate an\nalgebra which defines a non-commutative manifold. They are related to X through the\nfollowing relations\n1\nX\u03bc ,\nn\ni\nZ\u03bc\u03bd \u223c X\u03bc\u03bd ,\nn\n1\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u223c X\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb ,\nn\ni\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 \u223c X\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 .\nn\n\nZ\u03bc \u223c\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe Z's are suitably normalized so that they obey equations having coefficients O(1) in\n\nthe large n limit. In this paper, we will use Z as generators of the algebra of functions\n\u00c2n (S 4 ) and use X's as derivatives.\n3.3. Derivations on the matrix algebra \u00c2n (S 2k )\n\nIn the large n limit the matrix algebra reduces to an algebra of polynomials in Z's with\nconstraints, which will be given later. The action of the operators X\u03bc , X\u03bc\u03bd by commutators\ntransforms the polynomials in the variables Z\u03bc , Z\u03bc\u03bd . In particular, the X\u03bc\u03bd 's satisfy an\nSO(2k + 1) algebra, organizing all polynomials of Z's into representations of SO(2k + 1).\nRecall that we chose the normalizations (3.12) . We know from (3.4) , (3.8) that\n[X\u03bc , Z\u03bd ] = \u22122iZ\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.13)\n\n[X\u03bc , Z\u03bd\u03bb ] = \u22122i(\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd Z\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bb Z\u03bd ).\nTo reproduce these formulae we write :\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ Z\u03bd\nad(X\u03bc ) = \u22122i Z\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202Z\u03bd\n\u2202Z\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.14)\n\nSimilarly, we know from (3.8) , (3.9) that\n[X\u03bc\u03bd , Z\u03bb ] = 2(\u03b4\u03bd\u03bb Z\u03bc \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bb Z\u03bd ),\n[X\u03bc\u03bd , Z\u03bb\u03c1 ] = 2(\u03b4\u03bd\u03bb Z\u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4nu\u03c1 Z\u03bc\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bc\u03c1 Z\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bb Z\u03bd\u03c1 ).\n7\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fThis can be reproduced by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nad(X\u03bc\u03bd ) = 2 Z\u03bc\n\u2212 Z\u03bd\n\u2212 Z\u03bc\u03bb\n+ Z\u03bd\u03bb\n.\n\u2202Z\u03bd\n\u2202Z\u03bc\n\u2202Z\u03bb\u03bd\n\u2202Z\u03bb\u03bc\n\n(3.16)\n\nFor consistency, the equations (3.14) and (3.16) should agree with [X\u03bc , X\u03bd ] = 2X\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand indeed they do.\nThe X\u03bc , X\u03bc\u03bd can also be realized as differential operators on the fuzzy sphere An (S 2k ).\n\nThis is to be expected since we know that there is a dual description in terms of U (n)\ngauge theory on S 4 with instantons. In the original matrix model, Z\u03bc can be thought of\nas the matrix coordinates of D0-branes.\n3.4. Derivations on An (S 2k )\nWe showed above that the action by commutators of X\u03bc and X\u03bc\u03bd , denoted as ad(X\u03bc )\nand ad(X\u03bc\u03bd ), can be realized as derivatives on the finite n coset \u00c2n (S 2k ). We show here\n\nthat ad(X\u03bc\u03bd ) also acts as derivations on the non-associative algebra An (S 2k ), which is\nthe finite n algebra of spherical harmonics. The product on this space is defined by first\n\nmultiplying as matrices and then projecting onto symmetric representations. Indeed letting\nA and B be matrices in An (S 2k ), the product A \u25e6 B is defined by\nA \u25e6 B = P (AB),\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere P acting on any matrix transforming in anything other than a symmetric representation is zero, and leaves invariant any matrix trasmforming in the symmetric traceless\nrepresentation [10]. From its definition it is clear that P commutes with the action of\nSO(2k + 1) on matrices. Let us denote ad(X\u03bc\u03bd ) = L\u03bc\u03bd . We can write\nL\u03bc\u03bd (A \u25e6 B) = L\u03bc\u03bd (P (AB))\n= P (L\u03bc\u03bd (AB)) = P (L\u03bc\u03bd (A)B + AL\u03bc\u03bd (B))\n= P (L\u03bc\u03bd (A)B) + P (AL\u03bc\u03bd (B))\n\n(3.18)\n\n= L\u03bc\u03bd (A) \u25e6 B + A \u25e6 L\u03bc\u03bd (B).\nThis shows that L\u03bc\u03bd acts as a derivation on An (S 2k ). This is a finite n generalization of\n\nthe action of SO(2k + 1) on functions on the sphere S 2k .\n\nTo obtain an action of the full set of generators entering the algebra (3.8), (3.9) we\ncan also work with just the sphere, without invoking the coset, but we need to equip the\n8\n\n\fsphere with an embedding in R5 and consider vector fields on the normal bundle. We will\ndescribe the classical ( large n ) version of this construction here.\nIn terms of the Cartesian coordinates x\u03bc (\u03bc = 1, * * * , 2k + 1) in R2k+1 , functions\n\nrestricted to a unit sphere are functions of z\u03bc \u2261 x\u03bc /|x|. The naive derivative\n\n\u2202\n\u2202z\u03bc\n\nis not\n\nwell defined because it does not respect the constraint z\u03bc z\u03bc = 1.\nDefine vector fields on the normal bundle by\n\u2202\u03bc = |x|\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\nWe have\n[\u2202\u03bc , z\u03bd ] = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 z\u03bc z\u03bd = P\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere P\u03bc\u03bd is the projection operator which projects a vector in R2k+1 at z to the tengent\nplane on S 2k . One can check that the constraint z\u03bc z\u03bc = 1 is preserved under differentiation\nby \u2202\u03bc . It turns out that\n[\u2202\u03bc , \u2202\u03bd ] = x\u03bc\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 x\u03bd\n= L\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u2202x\u03bd\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhich is the generator of SO(2k + 1) rotations. We see that (\u2202\u03bc , L\u03bc\u03bd ) satisfy the same\nrelations (3.8) and (3.9) as (X\u03bc , X\u03bc\u03bd ) (up to an overall factor of 2). We will leave a finite\ngeneralization of this construction to the future.\n\n4.\n\nThe fuzzy 4-sphere case\nRather than analysing the complete set of equations and looking for explicit solutions,\n\na more efficient method is to use the known matrices, and obtain classical quantities, by\ntaking expectation values between states. One can check afterwards that the algebraic\nequations are indeed satisfied, as they should.\nTake the state |si \u2261 |0i \u2297 |0i * * * |0i in Sym(V \u2297n ) which is the n-fold tensor product\n\nof the fermion Fock space vacuum. Since \u03935 |0i = \u2212|0i, we have X5 |si = \u2212n|si. The\n\nnormalized operator Z5 has an expectation value hs|Z5 |si = \u22121. We also find that Z12 =\n\n1, Z34 = 1. So one solution to the system of algebraic equations that will be given in sec.4.4\nis\nZ5 = \u22121,\nZ12 = 1,\nZ34 = 1,\n9\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwith all other Z\u03bc and Z\u03bc\u03bd being zero. In the above we have abbreviated hs|Z|si as Z.\n\nNow we look at the subgroup of SO(5) which leaves this solution fixed. Requiring\n\nthat the configuration X5 = \u22121, Xi = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, be left invariant leads to\n\nan SO(4) subgroup that acts non-trivially on the index i. Consider linear combinations\nP\n\u03bb = ij \u03bbij Lij , where the lambda matrix is displayed below :\n0\n\uf8ec \u2212\u03bb13\n\u03bb=\uf8ed\n\u2212\u03bb12\n\u2212\u03bb14\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb13\n0\n\u2212\u03bb14\n\u2212\u03bb34\n\n\u03bb12\n\u03bb14\n0\n\u2212\u03bb13\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb14\n\u03bb34 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\u03bb13\n0\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe have chosen for convenience to label the rows and columns in the order (1324). These\nP\nmatrices ij \u03bbij Lij take the form\nA+B\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nA\n\u2212B\n\nB\nA\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(4.3)\n\nHere A is anti-symmetric and B is symmetric. These 4 \u00d7 4 matrices form a U (2) subgroup\nof the SO(4) subgroup of SO(5) which leaves X5 invariant.\n\nThe generators Lij , which are antisymmetric matrices of the SO(4) Lie algebra, act\non Zkl as follows :\nLij (Zkl ) = \u03b4jk Zil + \u03b4il Zjk \u2212 \u03b4ik Zjl \u2212 \u03b4jl Zik .\n(4.4)\nP\nP\nConsider a linear combination \u03b6 = i,j \u03b6ij Zij . Let a linear combination ij \u03bbij Lij act on\nP\n\u03b6. The result of this action is a sum \u03b4\u03b6 = ij Vij Zij . The coefficients V depend bilinearly\non \u03bb and \u03b6. Considering Vij as the entries of a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix V , (4.4) is equivalent to\n\nV = [\u03bb, \u03b6]. Decomposing \u03b6 into 2 \u00d7 2 blocks as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX Y\n\u03b6=\n,\n\u2212Y X\u0303\n\n(4.5)\n\nwe have X T = \u2212X, X\u0303 T = \u2212X\u0303 while Y is arbitrary. For \u03bb in the U (2) subalgebra (4.3)\n\nand using (4.5) ,\n\nV =\n\n\u0012\n\n([A, X] \u2212 [B, Y ])\n([A, Y ] + B X\u0303 \u2212 XB)\n\u2212BX + X\u0303B \u2212 [A, Y ]\n\u2212[B, Y ] + [A, X\u0303]\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(4.6)\n\nNow we want to evaluate the variation V on the solution we started with. The solution\ncan be described by a matrix \u03b6 (s) which is of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\n(s)\n\u03b6 =\n,\n1 0\n10\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fwhere each entry is a 2 \u00d7 2 block, and 0 is the zero matrix, and 1 is the identity matrix.\n\nGiven the form of the solution (4.7), this is equal to the trace of the off-diagonal blocks\n\nof V , i.e V12 + V34 . Now tr([A, Y ]) = 0. Further, B X\u0303 and BX are each antisymmetric,\ngiven that B is symmetric and X, X\u0303 are antisymmetric. Therefore, the off-diagonal block\nof the variation V , when \u03bb is in the u(2) subalgebra, has zero trace. This means that the\nsolution is invariant under the U (2) subgroup.\nWe have therefore shown that the stabilizer group of the solution is U (2). The action\nof SO(5) then generates a space of solutions which is SO(5)/U (2). The space related to the\nlarge N limit of the matrix algebra is then SO(5)/U (2). This is a bundle over S 4 with fibre\nSO(4)/U (2), a symmetric space. Using the isomorphism SO(4) = (SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2))/Z2 it\ncan be shown that the fibre is actually SU (2)/U (1), i.e the two-sphere. So we have in this\ncase\n\nSO(5)/U (2) \u2190\u2212 SO(4)/U (2) \u2261 SU (2)/U (1) \u2261 S 2\n\u2193\n\n(4.8)\n\nS 4 \u2261 SO(5)/SO(4)\nWe can also work directly with (4.4) and show that the U (2) subgroup described in\n(4.2) and (4.3) leaves (4.1) invariant. The generators of U (2) are L12 , L34 , L13 + L24 , and\nL14 \u2212 L23 . The generators L13 \u2212 L24 , L12 + L34 and L14 + L23 generate the S 2 bundle at\n|si which we will explain in more detail in the next subsection.\n\nAnother viewpoint toward this space is to view X\u03bc and X\u03bc\u03bd as generators of the\n\nSO(5, 1) Lie algebra. Similar arguments to the above lead to the conclusion that the space\nof the matrix algebra is the quotient space SO(5, 1)/U (2, 1) \u2243 SO(5)/U (2).\n4.1. Bundle structure at finite n\nIn the previous subsection we evaluated the operators Z\u03bc and Z\u03bc\u03bd for a state |si\n\nin Sym(V \u2297n ). By analysing the space of states which leaves the expectation values of\nZ\u03bc invariant, we will identify the space of states corresponding to the fibre of the noncommutative SO(5)/U (2) coset over a fixed point of the sphere.\nWe first define the base space of the bundle in the following way. As pointed out in\n[10], only totally symmetrized polynomials of Z\u03bc should be viewed as the quantum version\n\nof functions on S 4 . Let us use the term non-associative S 4 for the underlying space of\nthis (non-associative) algebra of functions. This is our base space. The non-associative\nalgebra of functions on the S 4 will be referred to as An (S 4 ).\n11\n\n\fWe define two states in the Hilbert space Sym(V \u2297n ) of the matrix algebra to be on\nthe same fiber if all functions in An (S 4 ) have the same expectation values for both states.\n\nAccording to the definition of Connes [16], this implies that the distance\n\n2\n\nbetween the\n\nprojection of the two states on An (S 4 ) is zero.\n\nThe state |si, for example, is on the same fiber with all (normalized) states in the\n\nspace W \u2261 Sym(V\u2212\u2297n ) where the space V\u2212 is spanned by |0i and a\u20201 a\u20202 |0i. One can check\n\nthat hs\u2032 |Z\u03bc |s\u2032 i is the same for all |s\u2032 i \u2208 Sym(V\u2212\u2297n ). For f in An (S 4 ), hs\u2032 |f (Z)|s\u2032 i is\n\nnonvanishing only if it is a product of an even number of Zi 's (i = 1, * * * , 4). In fact, the\n\nnonzero contributions are from terms with even numbers of \u0393i 's in each tensorial factor.\n\nHowever, a total symmetrization will render such products of \u0393i 's to be proportional to\nthe unity. Since hv|\u03935 |vi = \u22121 for all normalized |vi in V\u2212 . We see that all functions on\nAn (S 4 ) have the same expectation values for all |s\u2032 i.\n\nThe states on the fiber W form a representation for the operators M1 = Z13 \u2212\n\nZ24 , M2 = Z23 + Z14 , M3 = Z12 + Z34 , which satisfy the algebra of a fuzzy S 2\n[Mi , Mj ] = \u22122i\u01ebijk Mk .\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe rest of the Z\u03bc\u03bd 's have vanishing expectation values on the fiber. We can thus view\nthe fiber as a fuzzy 2-sphere with Cartesian coordinates Mi . Since the matrix algebra is\ncovariant under SO(5) transformations, the same can be said about every point of the base\nspace An (S 4 ). We conclude that the fuzzy 4-sphere is in fact a fuzzy S 2 fiber bundle over\n\nthe base space of An (S 4 ).\n\nThe points on the base sphere can be identified with the quotient space Sym(V \u2297n )/W .\n\nThe projection map from Sym(V \u2297n ) to the quotient space is the finite n analog of the\nprojection map from the coset space SO(5)/U (2) to the sphere S 4 .\nFunctions of Mi are sufficient to distinguish all states on the fiber. In fact, W is a\n(n + 1) dimensional irreducible representation for the SU (2) Lie algebra generated by Mi .\nThe set of all functions of Mi is the same as the set of all (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrices.\n2\n\nThe distance between two states \u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 on a space with algebra of functions A is defined to\n\nbe\ndist(\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 ) = sup{|h\u03c8|f |\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8 \u2032 |f |\u03c8 \u2032 i| : |Df | \u2264 1, f \u2208 A},\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere D is the so-called Dirac operator which defines the differential calculus. Although we did\nnot specify the Dirac operator for An (S 4 ), it should be clear that our comment here is valid for\nany choice of D.\n\n12\n\n\fHermitian functions of Mi generate the Lie algebra of U (n + 1). This leads to a direct\nconnection between the space of horizontal one-forms ( with indices parallel to the base )\non the SO(5)/U (2) coset with connections of a U (n + 1) bundle over the sphere. Further,\nscalar fields on the coset correspond to adjoint scalars which are sections of the U (n + 1)\nbundle.\n4.2. Relation to unitary bundle over S 4\nInterpreting X\u03bc\u03bd \u221d Z\u03bc\u03bd as a field strength, as is familiar in Matrix Theory, the fuzzy\n\nS 2 fiber bundle can also be understood as a U (n+1) vector bundle on spherical D4-branes,\nwhose worldvolume is the non-associative S 4 .\nThis connection can be used, in the large n limit, to compare the X\u03bc\u03bd matrix at the\npoint Z\u03bc = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) with the field strengths of the homogeneous instanton. We have\nX12 = X34 while other field strengths are zero. We will use the fact that\n1 = h0|\u03931 \u03932 |0i = h0|\u03933 \u03934 |0i,\n\n\u2212 1 = h0|a2 a1 \u03931 \u03932 a\u20201 a\u20202 |0i = h0|a2 a1 \u03933 \u03934 a\u20201 a\u20202 |0i,\n\n(4.11)\n\nA basis in Sym(V\u2212\u2297n ) can be labelled by the number of |0i's appearing in the tensor\nproduct. In such a basis it is clear that X12 = X34 is proportional to\nDiag(n, n \u2212 2, * * * , \u2212n + 2, \u2212n).\n\n(4.12)\n\nCompare this with the solution described in Appendix B of [4] where the F12 = F34 are\nthe only non-zero field strengths at the point \u03b11 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nwith all other angles zero. They are\n\nproportional to the embedding of 2\u03c33 in U (n + 1) using the standard (n + 1) dimensional\nrepresentation of SU (2), which is again the matrix (4.12) .\nA physical interpretation of this space is the following. The Z\u03bc 's can be viewed as\nmatrix coodinates of N \u2243 n3 /6 D0-branes. We know that the solution given by matrices\n\n(3.13) also contains spherical 4-branes. The number of these 4-branes at large n can be\n\ncomputed using the definition of 4-brane charge in Matrix Theory [17] as done in [2]. In\nthe application considered by [4] the zero-branes are replaced by 1 branes and the 4-branes\nby 5-branes. The number of 5-branes can be computed, in a manner similar to the Matrix\nTheory application, by analyzing couplings in the D1-brane action. Note that, in the\nprevious paragraph, the number of D4 ( or D5 ) was extracted directly from the fuzzy\nfibre bundle structure of the \u00c2n (S 2k ) without appealing to couplings on brane actions,\n13\n\n\fa fact which should be useful in more general contexts in Matrix Theory and D-brane\nphysics.\nIn the dual description, on the worldvolume of n coincident spherical D4-branes, we\nhave a U (n) gauge theory, X\u03bc 's are interpreted as the U (n) covariant derivatives and X\u03bc\u03bd\nas field strengths. D0-branes are realized as instantons of the U (n) gauge field. In (4.1) we\nsee that the field strength X\u03bc\u03bd is indeed a self-dual configuration at the north pole. Since\nthe matrix algebra is invariant under SO(5), it is clear that the matrices X\u03bc\u03bd correspond\nto homogeneous instantons on S 4 . It was found in [19][4] that the maximal number of\nhomogeneous instantons for an U (n) bundle on S 4 is n(n2 \u2212 1)/6. In the large n limit,\n\nthis is precisely the instanton number for our configuration X, as first observed in [4].\n\nFluctuations around this configuration can be described in terms of fields on the coset\nSO(5)/U (2). If a transverse matrix coordinate \u03a6 is excited to have a dependence on Z\u03bc\u03bd ,\nsuch as \u03a6 \u223c Z\u03bc\u03bd , a D2-brane dipole with charge density tr(Z\u03bc Z\u03bd \u03a6) is generated [4] . This\n\nis because each D4-brane has a different D2-brane charge density. They add up to zero\nwhen the D4-branes are on top of each other. But if different D4-branes have different\ntransverse fluctuations, D2-brane dipoles will appear.\n4.3. Traces and Integration\n\nIntegration on this non-commutative coset SO(5)/U (2) can be defined as the trace\nover Sym(V \u2297n ). The cyclicity of the trace automatically ensures SO(5) invariance of the\nintegration because\n\n1\nT r([X\u03bc\u03bd , f (Z)]) = 0.\n2\nFor a given function of Z, one can decompose it into irreducible representations of SO(5)\nT r(L\u03bc\u03bd (f (Z))) =\n\nas [10]\nf (Z) =\n\nX\n\naR,s YR,s (Z),\n\nR,s\n\nwhere R stands for irreducible representations and s for the indices of states in R. The\nSO(5) invariance implies that\nZ\n\nd\u03a9f (Z) = a0 =\n\n1\nT r(f ),\nN\n\nwhere a0 is the coefficient for the trivial representation, which is unique (with multiplicity one). Hence, in the large n limit, this integration agrees with the usual integration\non SO(5)/U (2) induced from the unique Haar measure on SO(5). The measure d\u03a9 is\nnormalized such that the volume of the coset is 1.\n14\n\n\f4.4. Further remarks on the coset SO(5)/U (2)\nHere we provide another way to obtain the same result of the coset SO(5)/U (2) \u2243\n\nS 4 \u00d7 S 2 by directly investigating the matrix algebra. Some of the algebraic relations for\n\nthe large n matrix algebra are\n\nZ\u03bc Z\u03bc \u2243 1,\n\n(4.13)\n\nZ\u03bc\u03bd Z\u03bc\u03bd \u2243 4 \u00d7 1,\n\n(4.14)\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\u03ba Z\u03bc\u03bd Z\u03bb\u03c1 \u2243 \u22128Z\u03ba ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nZ\u03bc\u03bd Z\u03bd\u03bb \u2243 \u22122\u03b4\u03bc\u03bb + Z\u03bc Z\u03bb ,\n\n(4.16)\n\nZ\u03bc Z\u03bc\u03bb \u2243 0.\n\n(4.17)\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\u03ba Z\u03bc Z\u03bd\u03bb \u2243 2Z\u03c1\u03ba ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nOne can also show that\n\nwhich says that Z\u03bc\u03bd is a self-adjoint tensor field on the sphere.\nRelation (4.13) means that Z\u03bc can be viewed as Cartesian coordinates of a unit fuzzy\nsphere. The identity (4.14) implies that the magnitude |Z\u03bc\u03bd | is of order 1. Incidentally,\nsince\n\n\u22122i\nZ\u03bc\u03bd ,\nn\n\n(4.19)\n\n\u2206Z\u03bc \u2206Z\u03bd \u223c O(1/n).\n\n(4.20)\n\n[Z\u03bc , Z\u03bd ] =\nwe can estimate the uncertainty in Z\u03bc as\n\nThis means that \"points\" on the the unit fuzzy sphere with Cartesian coordinates Z\u03bc have\nspread which scales like 1/n.\nIn the large n limit, the commutator of Z\u03bc (4.19) vanishes, showing that Z\u03bc\u03bd has to\nbe included as generators of the matrix algebra. All functions of Z\u03bc 's can be obtained from\ntotally symmetrized products of Z\u03bc 's and Z\u03bc\u03bd 's. Yet the Z\u03bc\u03bd 's are not completely independent, but are constrained by (4.14), (4.15) and (4.18) . Up to terms of order O(1/n2 ),\nwe can interpret these relations as constraints on a classical space with commutative co-\n\nordinates Z\u03bc , Z\u03bc\u03bd . At a given point on S 4 , say, (Z1 , * * * , Z5 ) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), the space of\nsolutions to these constraints is the set of anti-self dual tensors Zij for i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. This\nspace is a 2-sphere. The whole space is thus locally S 4 \u00d7 S 2 .\n15\n\n\f5.\n\nThe fuzzy 6-sphere case\n\n5.1. Solution to Equations and Stabilizer groups\nAnalogous to (4.1), the expectation values of |si are\nZ7 = \u22121, and Zi = 0 for i = 1 * * * 6,\n1\nZ12 = Z34 = Z56 = \u221a and Z\u03bc\u03bd = 0 otherwise,\n6\n1\nZ127 = Z347 = Z567 = \u221a\nand Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0 otherwise .\n18\n\n(5.1)\n\nWe have here defined Z's so that they satisfy the normalization condition\nX\n\nX\n\nZ\u03bc2 = 1,\n\n\u03bc\n\nX\n\n2\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\n= 1,\n\n\u03bc6=\u03bd\n\n2\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n= 1.\n\n(5.2)\n\n\u03bc6=\u03bd6=\u03c1\n\nThe Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 's are antisymmetric in the three indices. Eq.(5.1) is a classical solution to (5.2)\nand self-adjoint relations analogous to (4.15) and (4.18).\nWe prove that the stabilizer group of this solution is U (3). We define \u03b6 =\nOn the classical solution this takes the value\n\u03b6\n\n(s)\n\n1\n=\u221a\n6\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nP\n\nij \u03b6ij Zij .\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere we have chosen to label the rows and columns of the matrix as (135246). Similarly\nP\nwe can define a \u03b67 = ij \u03b6ij Zij7 . And we have after evaluating on the solution\n(s)\n\u03b67\n\n1\n=\u221a\n18\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe variations of \u03b6 and \u03b67 are both obtained by the action of commutators as in the\ncase of fuzzy S 4 . Therefore an argument similar to the one above shows that U (3) Lie\nalgebra matrices of the form\n\u0012\n\nA\n\u2212B\n\nB\nA\n\n\u0013\n\nwith A antisymmetric and B symmetric leave the solution invariant. As before the final\nstep will rely on the tracelessness of the off-diagonal blocks of matrices of the form (4.6),\nwhere the blocks are now 3 \u00d7 3 matrices.\n16\n\n\fSo the stabilizer group is U (3). By considering the action of the SO(7) symmetry of\nthe equations satisfied by the variables Z\u03bc , Z\u03bc\u03bd , and Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb , we find that a space SO(7)/U (3)\nis generated. This is a bundle over the sphere S 6 . The fibre is SO(6)/U (3).\nSO(7)/U (3) \u2190\u2212 SO(6)/U (3)\n\u2193\n\n(5.5)\n\nS 6 \u2261 SO(7)/SO(6)\n5.2. Bundle structure at finite n\nThe fibre over the sphere S 6 is, in the classical limit, the symmetric space SO(6)/U (3).\nAt finite n we have a fuzzy version of this space.\nAs in the discussion of \u00c2n (S 4 ), the vector subspace Sym(V\u2212\u2297n ) can be identified\n\nwith the points on the fibre. This space is spanned by |0i, and four states of the form\n\na\u2020i a\u2020j |0i. The symmetric product is an irreducible representation of SO(6) with weights\n~\u03bb = ( n , n , n ). This space has dimension ( see for exampe [20] )\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3).\n(5.6)\n6\nThe matrix algebra over this space is generated by the operators Z\u03bc\u03bd . Multiplying these\nD6 =\n\noperators leads to operators of the form\nX\n\u03c1s1 (\u0393\u0393)\u03c1s2 (\u0393\u0393) * * * \u03c1sr (\u0393\u0393).\n\n(5.7)\n\ns1 ,s2 ,***sr\n\nThis is somewhat schematic since we have not written out the indices on the \u0393 matrices.\nTo be more precise we would write out the indices and contract with a traceless tensor\nwhich has the symmetries of the Young diagram with two rows of length r. Every pair of\n\u0393 in the same \u03c1 factor is antisymmetrized. Such a representation has dimension\n1\nD(r) =\n(2r + 3)(r + 2)2 (r + 1)2 .\n12\nBy adding up these dimensions in the range 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n we get\nn\nX\n\nD(r) = D62 .\n\n(5.8)\n\n(5.9)\n\nr=0\n\n5.3. Relation to unitary bundles over the sphere\nAll these matrices are hermitian, so they form a basis for the Lie algebra of the unitary\ngroup with rank D6 = 61 (n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3). This indicates that the number of spherical\n6-branes when we use \u03a6\u03bc \u223c LZ\u03bc is 61 (n+1)(n+2)(n+3), giving a purely non-commutative\n\ngeometric derivation of the 6-brane charge. As before, the Z\u03bc\u03bd can be interpreted as field\nstrengths for unitary bundles.\n17\n\n\f6.\n\nThe fuzzy 8-sphere case\n\n6.1. Solutions to equations and stabilizer group\nThe large N limit of the matrix algebra is generated by commuting variables, Z\u03bc ,\nZ\u03bc\u03bd , Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb and Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 . The indices run from 1 to 9 and any variable with more than one\nindex is antisymmetric under exchange of any pair of indices.\nBy taking the expectation values of the appropriate matrices in a state one finds a\nparticular solution :\nZ9 = 1,\nand Zi = 0 for all other i,\n1\nZ12 = Z34 = Z56 = Z78 = \u221a ,\n8\nand Z\u03bc\u03bd = 0 otherwise ,\n1\nZ129 = Z349 = Z569 = Z789 = \u221a ,\n24\nand Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0 otherwise ,\nZ1234 = Z1256 = Z1278 = Z3456 = Z3478 = Z5678 =\n\n(6.1)\n\n\u22121\n,\n12\n\nand Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb = 0 otherwise.\nBy the statement that the variables with more than one index are zero otherwise, we mean\nthat all components not related to the ones shown by the permutation symmetries are\nzero. For example Z219 = \u2212Z912 = \u2212 \u221a124 , but Z139 = 0.\nThe normalizations are chosen such that\nX\nZ\u03bc2 = 1,\n\u03bc\n\nX\n\n2\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\n= 1,\n\n[\u03bc,\u03bd]\n\nX\n\n2\nZ\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\n= 1,\n\n(6.2)\n\n[\u03bc,\u03bd,\u03bb]\n\nX\n\n2\nZ[\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1]\n= 1.\n\n[\u03bc,\u03bd,\u03bb,\u03c1]\n\nThe sums [\u03bc, \u03bd] etc. indicate that the indices run over 1 to 9 while respecting the condition\nthat they are never equal. These variables are not all independent and obey contraints\n18\n\n\flike the one following from (3.11), and others that can be derived from the definitions in\nsection 3.2 in the large n limit.\nNow we consider the subgroup of SO(9) which leaves the solution invariant, i.e the\nstabilier group. Requiring that the Z\u03bc values stay invariant clearly forces the stabilizer\ngroup to be a subgroup of SO(8). Now requiring the Z\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb to be invariant picks\nout a U (4) subgroup of the SO(8). The proof proceeds as for the case of the fuzzy S 6 .\nThis can be described by taking 8 \u00d7 8 matrices of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA B\n,\n\u2212B A\nwhere B is symmetric and A is antisymmetric, and the rows and columns are labelled in\nthe order (13572468). We still need to prove that the configuration of Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 is invariant\nand this can be done directly using the following SO(9) transformations of the Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\nL\u03bc1 \u03bc2 (Z\u03bd1 \u03bd2 \u03bd3 \u03bd4 ) = (\u03b4\u03bc2 \u03bd1 Z\u03bc1 \u03bd2 \u03bd3 \u03bd4 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc2 \u03bd2 Z\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bd3 \u03bd4 + \u03b4\u03bc2 \u03bd3 Z\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 \u03bd4 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc2 \u03bd4 Z\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 \u03bd3 )\n\u2212 (\u03bc1 \u2194 \u03bc2 ).\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe explicit proof is tedious, we just show some example steps. Take for example the\ncombination L13 + L24 which is part of the U (3) subgroup. We have\nL13 (Z3256 ) = Z1256 ,\nL24 (Z3256 ) = \u2212Z3456 .\n\n(6.4)\n\nSince Z1256 = Z3456 on the solution, this means that the variation by L13 + L24 on Z3256\nis zero. Take another example, the variation of Z1356 . Now L13 (Z1356 ) = L24 (Z1356 ) are\nboth seen to be zero using (6.3) even before evluating on the solution. Another example\nis the variation of Z3456 . The action of L13 on this is Z1456 which is zero on the solution,\nand the variation of L24 gives Z3156 which is also zero. Similarly we can check for each\ngenerator of the U (4) that the variation of any of the Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 coordinates is zero. The steps\nare obvious and we will not spell out the complete proof.\nHaving established that the stabilizer group is U (4), it follows that action of the SO(9)\nsymmetry group generates a coset SO(9)/U (4). This is a bundle over the 8-sphere.\nSO(9)/U (4) \u2190\u2212 SO(8)/U (4)\n\u2193\n\n(6.5)\n\nS 8 \u2261 SO(9)/SO(8)\n19\n\n\f6.2. Bundle structure of the coset at finite n\nViewed as a bundle over S 8 , the coset SO(9)/U (4) has a fibre SO(8)/U (4). At finite\nn we have, as a space of states which has the same expectation values for X1 , * * * X9 , the\n\nspace Sym(V\u2212\u2297 n ), where V\u2212 is spanned by states of the form |0i, a\u2020i a\u2020j |0i and a\u20201 a\u20202 a\u20203 a\u20204 |0i.\nThis symmetric tensor product space is an irreducible representation of SO(8) with weight\n\u03bb = ( n2 , n2 , n2 , n2 ) and dimension [20]\nD8 =\n\n1\n(n + 5)(n + 4)(n + 3)2 (n + 2)(n + 1).\n360\n\n(6.6)\n\nThe operators Z\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 generate the matrices acting on this space. We get\noperators of the form\nX\n~\ns,~\nt\n\n\u03c1s1 (\u0393\u0393\u0393\u0393) * * * \u03c1sp1 (\u0393\u0393\u0393\u0393) \u03c1t1 (\u0393\u0393) * * * \u03c1tp2 (\u0393\u0393).\n\n(6.7)\n\nAfter endowing operators of this form with SO(8) indices and contracting with traceless tensors of the appropriate symmetry, these correspond to irreducible representations\nassociated with Young diagrams having row lengths (p1 + p2 , p1 + p2 , p1 , p1 ). This representation has dimension\n1\n(2p1 + 2p2 + 5)(p2 + 2)2 (p2 + 2p1 + 4)(p2 + 3)\u00d7\n4320\n\u00d7 (p2 + 3 + 2p1 )2 (p2 + 1)(p2 + 2p1 + 2)(2p1 + 1).\n\nD(p1 , p2 ) =\n\n(6.8)\n\nAdding up these dimensions, using Maple, we find\nn n\u2212p\nX1\nX\n\nD(p1 , p2 ) = D82 ,\n\n(6.9)\n\np1 =0 p2 =0\n\nwhere D8 is given in (6.6).\nThese formulae allow us to read off the representations of SO(8) and their multiplicities\n( all 1 ) appearing as harmonics on the coset space SO(8)/U (4).\n6.3. Relation to unitary bundles\nThe generating operators Z\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 are hermitian and their products which\ngenerate the full matrix algebra of dimension D82 are all hermitian. So they can be thought\nas Lie algebra elements for U (D). This shows that a fuzzy 8-sphere construction based on\nthese matrices in any matrix brane action involves D8 spherical 8-branes. As we discussed\nin the section on the fuzzy 4-sphere, we can read off the U (D) field strengths at the N-pole\nof the sphere.\n20\n\n\f7.\n\nAction for fluctuations and field theory on SO(2k + 1)/U (k)\nWe will outline here some features of the action describing fluctuations around classical\n\nsolutions of matrix brane world-volume theories, such as the solutions in [4], [3] or [2].\nThe details will depend on the particular application. We will be somewhat schematic,\noutlining generic features, in particular the appearance of the SO(2k + 1)/U (k) coset as\nthe base space of a field theory having U (1) gauge fields and an action compatible with\nthe geometrical SO(2k + 1) symmetry. For concreteness we will discuss the case of the\nfour-sphere with SO(5) symmetry.\nConsider either the application of [4] to brane intersections or the application in [2].\nTake any scalar transverse to the 5 scalars that go into the fuzzy sphere. Call it \u03a6. We\nP\nexpand it as \u03a6 = R,s aR,s YR,s (Z). The YR,s 's are operators associated with the state s\n\nin the representation R of SO(5). They are normalized as\nZ\nd\u03a9 YR,s (Z)YR,s (Z \u2020 ) = 1.\n\n(7.1)\n\nTo ensure correct normalization, operators of the form\nX\nX\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\nA[\u03bcij ]\n\u03c1s1 (\u0393\u03bc1 \u0393\u03bc1 )\u03c1s2 (\u0393\u03bc2 \u0393\u03bc2 ) * * * \u03c1sr2 (\u0393\u03bcr2 \u0393\u03bcr2 )\u00d7\n\u03bcij\n\n~\ns\n\n\u03bc1r\n\n\u00d7 \u03c1sr2 +1 (\u0393\n\n2 +1\n\n\u03bc1r\n\n) * * * \u03c1sr1 (\u0393\n\n1\n\n(7.2)\n\n),\n\nassociated with Young diagrams having a first row of length r1 and a second row of length\nr2 , are multiplied by a factor N (n, r1 , r2 ), which behaves in the large n limit as n\u2212r1 .\nFrom the kinetic term for \u03a6 we obtain\nZ\nZ\nN\n1\n2\ndt T r (\u2202t \u03a6) =\ndtd\u03a9 (\u2202t \u03a6)2 .\ng s ls\ng s ls\n\n(7.3)\n\nOn the right hand side we have converted the trace into an integral, and we have recognized\n\u03a6 as a field living on the coset.\nOther terms in the action give rise to spatial derivatives acting on the field \u03a6. Indeed\nR\nwe have terms in the zero-brane action which are of the form gs1l5 dtT r[\u03a6i , \u03a6]2 . We\ns\n\nexpand \u03a6i = LZi + L2 Ai , where L is the size of the sphere described by the matrix\nP\n2\ncoordinates \u03a6i of the zero branes and Ai = R,s aR,s\ni YR,s (Z). We chose a factor L in\n\nfront of Ai to ensure that it has the dimensions of a gauge field. Since we identiftied Xi\nas derivatives section 3.3 we will get terms of the form\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013 \u00132\nZ\n\u2212N\nL\n\u2202\n\u2202\ndtd\u03a9\nZj\n\u03a6 .\n+ Zij\ngs ls5\nn\n\u2202Zij\n\u2202Zj\n21\n\n(7.4)\n\n\fWe also have terms of the form\nL4\ngs ls5\n\nZ\n\ndt d\u03a9([Ai , \u03a6])2 .\n\n(7.5)\n\nThis should be interpreted as a commutator of star products. More detailed formulae for\nthe star product can be developed along the lines of [21] for example.\nR\nSimilarly we have terms of the form gs1l5 dt T r ([\u03a6i , \u03a6j ])2 . These lead to expressions\ns\nR\nR\nR\nwhich include dtd\u03a9(DA)2 , dtd\u03a9D2 and [A, A]2 terms, where the D's are appropriate\nR\nderivatives which can be read off from section 3. The term dtd\u03a9D2 is just constant.\nThe remaining terms are all terms we may expect from a theory containing gauge fields\n\nand scalars living on SO(5)/U (2) with an SO(5) symmetry and a non-commutative U (1)\ngauge symmetry.\nThe non-commutative U (1) gauge symmetry can be derived from the original symmetries of the Matrix Theory. We know that there is a unitary symmetry generated\nby hermitian matrices \u039b. Since hermitian matrices give the spherical harmonics on the\nSO(5)/U (2) coset, we have symmetry variations of the form\n\u03b4\u039b \u03a6i = [\u039b, \u03a6i ],\n\n(7.6)\n\n\u03b4\u039b Ai = [Xi , \u039b] + [Ai , \u03bb],\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhich translate into\n\nwhere \u039b is a function on the coset.\nNote, however, that this U (1) gauge theory is different from ordinary gauge theories\nin that the gauge potential Ai is defined only for directions along the non-associative\nsphere, not for all directions on the coset. This is because there are only 2k + 1 matrix\ncoordinates X\u03bc in the original matrix model, which are Cartesian coordinates on a 2ksphere. The k(k \u2212 1) new dimensions corresponding to fibres of the coset SO(2k + 1)/U (k)\nare generated by noncommutativity, which is dictated by the equations of motion for the\nmatrix coordinates. This is reminiscent of the recent proposal of dynamically generated\nnew dimensions [22].\n22\n\n\f8.\n\nSummary and outlook\nWe identified some higher dimensional geometries which are relevant to the matrix\n\nconstruction of fuzzy spheres of dimension greater than two. When we look at fuzzy 4spheres, the relevant geometry is 6-dimensional. For 6-spheres it is 12 dimensional, and for\n8-spheres it is 20 dimensional. These geometries of the form SO(2k + 1)/U (k) are bundles\nover spheres S 2k with fibre SO(2k)/U (k).\nWe outlined an approach to understand this geometry in terms of constructing 4branes by locally putting together D0-branes, in the case of the fuzzy 4-sphere. It is shown\nthat the fuzzy coset SO(5)/U (2) can be viewed locally as the product of fuzzy 2-sphere\nand non-associative 4-sphere. We generalized these to the 6-sphere and 8-sphere.\nIn developing the structure of the fuzzy SO(2k + 1)/U (k) algebras as bundles over a\nnon-associative sphere with a fuzzy SO(2k)/U (k) fibre, we were lead to an interpretation\nof the coordinates on the fuzzy fibre as field strengths on the base sphere for a unitary\nbundle whose rank could be read off from the geometry of the fuzzy fibre space. This gives a\npurely non-commutative geometric derivation of the brane charges involved. It also allows\nus to construct directly from the matrices the field strengths for the interpretation in terms\nof field theory on a sphere. For the case of the four sphere, this allowed us to reproduce\nthe field strengths of the homogeneous instantons first discussed in this context in [4]. It\nwould be interesting to develop this further to reproduce not just the field strength but\nalso the connection. We find that the fuzzy spheres provide very peculiar examples of\nnoncommutative space for which the noncommutativity of the non-Abelian gauge group is\nmixed with that of the base space.\nFurther study of the higher dimensional cases would also be interesting.\n\nThe\n\nSO(2k + 1) covariant Matrix Theory construction should allow the reconstruction of classical solutions for non-Abelian theories on S 2k in the large N limit.\nThe fluctuations of the solutions have a description in terms of non-Abelian theory\nof multiple branes on S 2k . Interestingly, there is also a description in terms of an Abelian\ntheory on the higher dimensional coset space SO(2k +1)/U (k). We outlined some elements\nof this description, noting the U (1) gauge symmetry and SO(2k + 1) invariance. The\ndetailed geometry of this Lagrangian remains to be understood. More generally, it will be\ninteresting to further understand and interpret the appearance of these higher dimensional\ngeometries in string theory.\nWhile the fuzzy 4-sphere has been studied in some detail [2,4,23] in the context of Matrix constructions, involving a low-dimensional brane growing into a higher dimensional\n23\n\n\fbrane, in contexts where several physical points of view are available, e.g the lower dimensional brane world-volume, the spherical brane worldvolume as well as supergravity,\nit will be very instructive to conduct analogous studies of more general spheres. Such\ngeneralizations should shed further light on the physics of the higher coset geometries\nSO(2k + 1)/U (k). Another potential class of applications of the various non-commutative\ngeometries we discussed is purely field theoretic and attempts to find symmetry preserving finite approximations to base spaces of field theories. Some recent work on different\nexamples of non-commutative cosets appears in [24][25], and metric aspects of the noncommutative geometry of spheres are studied in [26].\nAcknowledgements: We wish to thank for pleasant discussions Steve Corley, Vladimir\nFock, Zack Guralnik, Antal Jevicki, David Lowe and Djorje Minic.

For concreteness\n\nwe describe the case An (S 4 ), but the arguments are general.\n\nWe first prove that the multiplication in An (S 4 ) is commutative. Let us begin with\n\nsome examples:\n\nX\u03bc \u25e6 X\u03bd = P (\n= P(\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc )\u03c1s (\u0393\u03bd ))\n\nr\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc \u0393\u03bd )) + P (\n\nr\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc )\u03c1s (\u0393\u03bd ))\n\nr6=s\n\n\u03c1r (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ) +\n\nr\n\n= n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd +\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc )\u03c1s (\u0393\u03bd )\n\n(9.1)\n\nr6=s\n\nX\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc )\u03c1s (\u0393\u03bd )\n\nr6=s\n\n(n2 + 4n)\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd + X(\u03bc\u03bd) .\n5\nIn the third line, we have used the fact that the antisymmetric part of the first term belongs\n=\n\nto a representation with row lengths ~r = (1, 1) which is projected out by P . This leaves\n24\n\n\fonly the symmetric part which is proportional to \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd . In the last line, we have introduced\na symmetric traceless tensor of rank 2\nX(\u03bc\u03bd) =\n\nX\nr6=s\n\n\u03c1r (\u0393\u03bc )\u03c1s (\u0393\u03bd ) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n\nn(n \u2212 1)\n.\n5\n\n(9.2)\n\nIt is clear that the product in (9.1) is commutative. In general we have a product of\nthe form\nX(\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ***\u03bck ) X(\u03bd1 \u03bd2 ***\u03bdl ) = a1 X(\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ***\u03bck \u03bd1 \u03bd2 ***\u03bdl )\n+ a2 (\u03b4\u03bc1 \u03bd1 X(\u03bc2 ***\u03bck \u03bd2 ***\u03bdl ) + \u03b4\u03bc2 \u03bd2 X(\u03bc1 \u03bc3 ***\u03bck \u03bd1 \u03bd3 ***\u03bdl ) + * * *) + * * * ,\n\n(9.3)\n\nwhere a1 , a2 etc. are constants that can be worked out. The remaining terms multiplied by\na2 involve different contractions of one \u03bc index with one \u03bd index. The \"* * *\" denote terms\n\nwith more \u03b4's which contract some set of \u03bc indices with some set of \u03bd indices multiplied\nby symmetric traceless tensors with lower rank. All the terms appearing on the right\nhand side of (9.3) are symmetric under the operation which exchanges all the \u03bc with the\n\u03bd indices. This shows that the product is commutative for an arbitrary pair of elements\nin An (S 4 ).\n\nIt is important to note that while the product A\u25e6B is commutative, it does not contain\n\nthe most general element of \u00c2n (S 4 ) appearing symmetrically in the matrix product.\nA \u25e6 B 6=\n\n1\n(AB + BA).\n2\n\n(9.4)\n\nWe recall that the product A \u2217 B = 21 (AB + BA) actually make \u00c2n (S 4 ) a Jordan Algebra,\n\nwhich requires that the following identity be satisfied ( see for example [27])\n((A \u2217 A) \u2217 B) \u2217 A = (A \u2217 A) \u2217 (B \u2217 A).\n\n(9.5)\n\nThe product A \u25e6 B has an interesting relation to A \u2217 B:\nA \u25e6 B = A \u2217 B \u2212 Q(AB).\n\n(9.6)\n\nQ is a projector which acts as 1 on all elements of \u00c2n (S 4 ) which transform in representa-\n\ntions of SO(5) corresponding to Young diagrams with rows ~r = (2L+M, 2L) for L \u2265 1 and\n\nM is an arbitrary integer such that 2L + M \u2264 n. Equivalently, these Young diagrams have\n\nan even ( non-zero ) number of columns of length 2. Q is zero on all other representations.\n\nRepresentations which are picked out by Q, while they involve some antisymmetrizations\n25\n\n\fand are projected out by P , have the property that they can appear symmetrically when\nA and B, belonging to the vector space An (S 4 ), are multiplied as matrices.\n\nWe observe that Q(X\u03bc X\u03bd ) = 0. Representations with an even number of columns of\n\nlength two do not appear in the matrix product X\u03bc X\u03bd , which means that the fuzzy sphere\nproduct coincides with the symmetrized product and the identity in (9.5) is satisfied if A\nand B involve only X\u03bc , X\u03bd . When we multiply more general elements in An (S 4 ) such as\n\nX(\u03bc\u03bd) \u25e6 X(\u03b1\u03b2) we can get the representations picked out by Q.\n\nRepresentations which have ~r = (r1 , r2 ) with r1 , r2 \u226a n, give harmonics which must\n\nbe normalized by factors O(1/nr1 ), since they involve operators acting on r1 different\n\nfactors of the n-fold tensor product. Keeping track of such normalizations\nX[k] X[l]\n1 X[k+l\u22122,2]\n\u223c 2\n+ ***,\nk\nl\nn n\nn nk+l\u22122\n\n(9.7)\n\nwe have written down the simplest operator picked out by Q which appears when symmetric\ntraceless tensor operators of rank k and l are multiplied ( the subscript on the X describe\nthe row lengths of the irreducible representation they trasnform in ). If we only keep terms\nat order 1/n these can be neglected from the matrix product, so A \u25e6 B = A \u2217 B, which\nmeans that the Jordan identity is satisfied. Recall that the simplest representations which\n\ncause non-associativity of the A \u25e6 B product are the representations with a second row of\n\nlength 1 which can appear in the matrix product. This is a 1/n effect.\n\nTo summarize, if we neglect all terms in the structure constants of the normalized\noperators which are O(1/n) and higher, we have a commutative and associative multi-\n\nplication as expected for an algebra approaching the classical algebra of functions on the\nS 4 . If we keep O(1/n) and neglect terms of O( n12 ) and higher, we have commutative,\nnon-associative algebra which is an infinite dimensional Jordan algebra. If we keep higher\n\norder terms we have a commutative and non-associative algebra which is not Jordan. And\nthis is the structure at generic finite n.\n\n26\n\n\fReferences\n[1] H. Grosse, C.
