ALLEGRO was operated in three different orientations during the\nexperiment to modulate the relative sign of gravitational-wave and environmental correlations. No\nstatistically significant correlations were seen in any of the orientations, and the results were used\nto set a Bayesian 90% confidence level upper limit of \u03a9gw (f ) \u2264 1.02, which corresponds to a\ngravitational wave strain at 915 Hz of 1.5\u00d710\u221223 Hz\u22121/2 . In the traditional units of h2100 \u03a9gw (f ), this\nis a limit of 0.53, two orders of magnitude better than the previous direct limit at these frequencies.\nThe method was also validated with successful extraction of simulated signals injected in hardware\nand software.\nPACS numbers:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the signals targeted by the current generation of ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors\nis a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB)\n[1, 2, 3]. Such a background is analogous to the cosmic\nmicrowave background, although the dominant contribution is unlikely to have a blackbody spectrum. A SGWB\ncan be characterized as cosmological or astrophysical in\norigin. Cosmological backgrounds can arise from, for\nexample, pre-big-bang models [4, 5, 6], amplification of\nquantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation [7, 8, 9],\nphase transitions [10, 11], and cosmic strings [12, 13, 14].\nAstrophysical backgrounds consist of a superposition of\nunresolved sources, which can include rotating neutron\nstars [15, 16], supernovae [17] and low-mass X-ray binaries [18].\nThe standard cross-correlation search [19] for a SGWB\nnecessarily requires two or more GW detectors. Such\nsearches have been performed using two resonant bar detectors [20] and also using two or more kilometer-scale\nGW interferometers (IFOs) [22, 23, 24]. The present\nwork describes the results of the first cross-correlation\nanalysis carried out between an IFO (the 4 km IFO at\nthe LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO), known as L1)\nand a bar (the cryogenic ALLEGRO detector, referred to\nas A1). This pair of detectors is separated by only 40 km,\nthe closest pair among modern ground-based GW detector sites, which allows it to probe the stochastic GW\nspectrum around 900 Hz. In addition, the ALLEGRO\nbar can be rotated, changing the response of the correlated data streams to stochastic GWs and thus providing\na means to distinguish correlations due to a SGWB from\nthose due to correlated environmental noise [25]. This paper describes cross-correlation analysis of L1 and A1 data\ntaken between February 22 and March 23, 2005, during\nLIGO's fourth science run (S4).

(There are two \u03a9gw (f ) = 1.02 curves, corresponding to the different strain levels such a background\nwould generate in an IFO and a bar, as explained in Sec.II\nand [27].) The quantity plotted is amplitude spectral density (ASD), the square root of the one-sided power spectral\ndensity defined in (4.2), at a resolution of 0.25 Hz.\n\nThe LLO-ALLEGRO correlation experiment is complementary to experiments using data from the two LIGO\nsites, in that it is sensitive to a SGWB at frequencies\nof around 900 Hz rather than 100 Hz. Targeted sources\nare thus those with a relatively narrow-band spectrum\npeaked near 900 Hz. Spectra with such shapes can arise\nfrom exotic cosmological models, as described in Sec. II,\nor from astrophysical populations [16].\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Sec. II\nreviews the properties and characterization of a SGWB.\n\n\f4\nSec. III describes the LLO and ALLEGRO experimental arrangements, including the data acquisition and\nstrain calibration for each instrument. Sec. IV describes\nthe cross-correlation method and its application to the\npresent situation. Sec. V describes the details of the postprocessing methods and statistical interpretation of the\ncross-correlation results. Sec. VI describes the results of\nthe cross-correlation measurement and the corresponding upper limit on the SGWB strength in the range 850\u2013\n950 Hz. Sec. VII describes the results of our analysis\npipeline when applied to simulated signals injected both\nwithin the analysis software and in the hardware of the\ninstruments themselves. Sec. VIII compares our results\nto those of previous experiments and to the sensitivities\nof other operating detector pairs. Sec. IX considers the\nprospects for future work.\n\nOverlap Reduction Function\n1\n\nSTOCHASTIC GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE\nBACKGROUNDS\n\nA gravitational wave (GW) is described by the metric\ntensor perturbation hab (~r, t). A given GW detector, located at position ~rdet on the Earth, will measure a GW\nstrain which, in the long-wavelength limit, is some projection of this tensor:\nh(t) = hab (~rdet , t)dab\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere dab is the detector response tensor, which is\ndab\n(ifo) =\n\n1 a b\n(x\u0302 x\u0302 \u2212 \u0177 a \u0177 b )\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor an interferometer with arms parallel to the unit vectors x\u0302 and \u0177 and\na b\ndab\n(bar) = \u00fb \u00fb\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor a resonant bar with long axis parallel to the unit\nvector \u00fb.\nA stochastic GW background (SGWB) can arise from a\nsuperposition of uncorrelated cosmological or astrophysical sources. Such a background, which we assume to be\nisotropic, unpolarized, stationary and Gaussian, will generate a cross-correlation between the strains measured by\ntwo detectors. In terms Rof the continuous Fourier trans\u221e\nform defined by e\na(f ) = \u2212\u221e dt a(t) exp(\u2212i2\u03c0f t), the expected cross-correlation is\n1\nhe\nh\u22171 (f )e\nh2 (f \u2032 )i = \u03b4(f \u2212 f \u2032 ) Sgw (f ) \u03b312 (f )\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b312 (f ) = d1ab dcd\n2\n\n5\n4\u03c0\n\nZZ\n\ni2\u03c0f n\u0302*(~\nr2 \u2212~\nr1 )/c\nd2 \u03a9n\u0302 P TTn\u0302ab\ncd e\n\n(2.5)\nis the overlap reduction function (ORF) [26] between the\ntwo detectors, defined in terms of the projector P TTn\u0302ab\ncd\nonto traceless symmetric tensors transverse to the unit\n\nLLO\u2212ALLEGRO (N108\u00b0W) \"XARM\"\n\n0.6\n\nLLO\u2212ALLEGRO (N18\u00b0W) \"YARM\"\n\n0.4\n\nLLO\u2212ALLEGRO (N63\u00b0W) \"NULL\"\n\n0.2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22121\n0\n\nII.\n\nLLO\u2212LHO\n\n0.8\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n500\n600\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 2: The overlap reduction function for LIGO Livingston\nObservatory (LLO) with ALLEGRO and with LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO). The three LLO-ALLEGRO curves\ncorrespond to the three orientations in which ALLEGRO\nwas operated during LIGO's S4 run: \"XARM\" (N108\u25e6 W) is\nnearly parallel to the x-arm of LLO (\"aligned\"); \"YARM\"\n(N18\u25e6 W) is nearly parallel to the y-arm of LLO (\"antialigned\"); \"NULL\" (N63\u25e6 W) is halfway in between these\ntwo orientations (a \"null alignment\" midway between the two\nLLO arms). Note that for non-zero frequencies, the separation vector between the two sites breaks the symmetry between the \"XARM\" and \"YARM\" alignments, and leads to\nan offset of the \"NULL\" curve, as described in [27]. The LLOLHO overlap reduction function is shown for reference. The\nfrequency band of the present analysis, 850 Hz \u2264 f \u2264 950 Hz,\nis indicated with dashed vertical lines.\n\nvector n\u0302. The ORF for several detector pairs of interest\nis shown in Fig. 2.\nSgw (f ) is the one-sided spectrum of the SGWB. This\nis the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) the background would generate in an interferometer with perpendicular arms, which can be seen from (2.4) and the\nfact that the ORF of such an interferometer with itself\nis unity. Since the ORF of a resonant bar with itself is\n4/3 (see [27] and Sec. VII A for more details), the PSD of\nthe strain measured by a bar detector due to the SGWB\nwould be (4/3)Sgw (f ).\nA related measure of the spectrum is the dimensionless\nquantity \u03a9gw (f ), the GW energy density per unit logarithmic frequency divided by the critical energy density\n\u03c1c needed to close the universe:\n\u03a9gw (f ) =\n\nf d\u03c1gw\n10\u03c0 2 3\nf Sgw (f ) .\n=\n\u03c1c df\n3H02\n\n(2.6)\n\nNote that the definition \u03a9gw (f ) thus depends on the\nvalue of the Hubble constant H0 . Most SGWB literature\n\n\f5\navoids this artificial uncertainty by working in terms of\n\u00132\n\u0012\nH0\n\u03a9gw (f )\n(2.7)\nh2100 \u03a9gw (f ) =\n100 km/s/Mpc\nrather than \u03a9gw (f ) itself. We will instead follow the\nprecedent set by [23] and quote numerical values for\n\u03a9gw (f ) assuming a Hubble constant of 72 km/s/Mpc.\nA variety of spectral shapes have been proposed for\n\u03a9gw , for both astrophysical and cosmological stochastic\nbackgrounds [3, 30, 31]. For example, whereas the slowroll inflationary model predicts a constant \u03a9gw (f ) in the\nbands of LIGO or ALLEGRO, certain alternative cosmological models predict broken-power law spectra, where\nthe rising and falling slopes, and the peak-frequency are\ndetermined by model parameters [3]. String-inspired prebig-bang cosmological models belong to this category\n[5, 28]. For certain ranges of these three parameters\nthe LLO-ALLEGRO correlation measurement offers the\nbest constraints on theory that can be inferred from any\ncontemporary observation. This can happen, e.g., if the\npower-law exponent on the rising spectral slope is greater\nthan 3 and the peak-frequency is sufficiently close to 900\nHz [29].\nIII.\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe LIGO Livingston Interferometer\n\nThe experimental setup of the LIGO observatories has\nbeen described at length elsewhere [38]. Here we provide a brief review, with particular attention paid to details significant for the LLO-ALLEGRO cross-correlation\nmeasurement.\nThe LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO) is an interferometric GW detector with perpendicular 4-km arms.\nThe laser interferometer senses directly any changes in\nthe differential arm length. It does this by splitting a\nlight beam at the vertex, sending the separate beams\ninto 4-km long optical cavities of their respective arms,\nand then recombining the beams to detect any change in\nthe optical phase difference between the arms, which is\nequivalent to a difference in light travel time. This provides a measurement of h(t) as defined in (2.1) and (2.2).\nHowever, the measured quantity is not exactly h(t) for\ntwo reasons:\nFirst, there are local forces which perturb the test\nmasses, and so produce changes in arm length. There\nare also optical and electronic fluctuations that mimic\nreal strains. The combination of these effects causes a\nstrain noise n(t) to always be present in the output, producing a measurement of\ns(t) = h(t) + n(t)\n\n(3.1)\n\nSecond, the test masses are not really free. There is\na servo system, which uses changes in the differential\narm length as its error signal q(t), and then applies extra\n\n(\"control\") forces to the test masses to keep the differential arm length nearly zero. It is this error signal q(t)\nwhich is recorded, and its relationship to the strain estimate s(t) is most easily described in the Fourier domain:\ne )e\nse(f ) = R(f\nq (f )\n\n(3.2)\n\ne ) is estimated by a combinaThe response function R(f\ntion of modelling and measurement [39] and varies slowly\nover the course of the experiment.\nBecause the error signal q(t) has a smaller dynamic\nrange than the reconstructed strain s(t), our analysis\nstarts from the digitized time series q[k] = q(tk ) (sampled 214 = 16384 times per second, and digitally downsampled to 4096 Hz in the analysis) and reconstructs the\nLLO strain only in the frequency domain.\n\nB.\n\nThe ALLEGRO Resonant Bar Detector\n\nThe ALLEGRO resonant detector, operated by a\ngroup from Louisiana State University [41], is a two-ton\naluminum cylinder coupled to a niobium secondary resonator. The secondary resonator is part of an inductive\ntransducer [42] which is coupled to a DC SQUID. Strain\nalong the cylindrical axis excites the first longitudinal\nvibrational mode of the bar. The transducer is tuned\nfor sensitivity to this mechanical mode. Raw data acquired from the detector thus reflect the high Q resonant\nmechanical response of the system. A major technical\nchallenge of this analysis is due to the extent to which\nthe bar data differ from those of the interferometer.\n\n1.\n\nData Acquisition, Heterodyning and Sampling\n\nThe ALLEGRO detector has a relatively narrow sensitive band of \u223c 100 Hz centered around \u223c 900 Hz near\nthe two normal modes of the mechanical bar-resonator\nsystem. For this reason, the output of the detector can\nfirst be heterodyned with a commercial lock-in amplifier to greatly reduce the sampling rate, which is set at\n250 samples/s. Both the in-phase and quadrature outputs of the lock-in are recorded and the detector output\ncan thus be represented as a complex time series which\ncovers a 250 Hz band centered on the lock-in reference\noscillator frequency. This reference frequency is chosen\nto be near the center of the sensitive band, and during\nthe S4 run it was set to 904 Hz. The overall timing of\ndata heterodyned in this fashion is provided by both the\nsampling clock and the reference oscillator. Both time\nbases were locked to GPS.\nThe nature of the resonant detector and its data acquisition system gives rise to a number of timing issues: heterodyning, filter delays of the electronics and the timing\nof the data acquisition system itself [21]. It is of critical\nimportance that the timing be fully understood so that\n\n\f6\nthe phase of any potential signal may be recovered. Convincing evidence that all of the issues are accounted for\nin is demonstrated by the recovery and cross-correlation\nof test signals simultaneously injected into both detectors. The signals were recovered at the expected phase\nas presented in Sec. VII.\n\n2.\n\nStrain Calibration\n\nThe raw detector output is proportional to the displacement of the secondary resonator, and thus has a\nspectrum with sharp line features due to the high-Q resonances of the bar-resonator system as can be seen in\nFig. 3. The desired GW signal is the effective strain on\n4\n\nRaw spectrum, S4 run \u2212 averaged over orientation\n\n10\n\nAmplitude Spectrum (counts / \u221aHz)\n\nXARM\nYARM\nNULL\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nature variations, so these frequencies are determined for\neach stretch and those are incorporated into the model of\nthe mechanical response of the system to a strain. The\nmodel consists of two double poles at these normal mode\nfrequencies. In addition to this response we must then\naccount for the phase shifts due to the time delays in the\nlock-in and anti-aliasing filters.\nAfter applying the full response function, the data are\nthen inverse Fourier-transformed back to the time domain. The next 50% overlapping 30 minute segment is\nthen taken. The windowed segments are stitched together until the entire continuous stretch of good data\nis completed. The first and last 15 minutes are dropped.\nThe result represents a heterodyned complex time series\nof strain, whose amplitude spectral density is shown in\nFig. 1.\nThe overall scale of the detector output in terms of\nstrain is determined by applying a known signal to the\nbar. A force applied to one end of the bar has a simple theoretical relationship to an equivalent gravitational\nstrain [21, 32, 33]. A calibrated force can be applied via\na capacitive \"force generator\" which also provides the\nmechanism used for hardware signal injections. A reciprocal measurement \u2013 excitation followed by measurement\nwith the same transducer \u2013 along with known properties\nof the mechanical system, allows the determination of\nthe force generator constant . With that constant determined (with units of newtons per volt) a calibrated force\nis applied to the bar and the overall scale of the response\ndetermined.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n840\n\n860\n\n880\n\n900\n920\nfrequency (Hz)\n\n940\n\n3.\n\n960\n\nFIG. 3: The graph displays the amplitude spectral density\nof raw ALLEGRO detector output during S4, at a frequency\nresolution of 0.1 Hz. For this graph these data have not been\ntransformed to strain via the calibrated response\nfunction The\n\u221a\nvertical scale represents digital counts/ Hz The normal mechanical modes where the detector is most sensitive are at\n880.78 Hz and 917.81 Hz. There is an injected calibration line\nat 837 Hz. Also prominent are an extra mechanical resonance\nat 885.8 Hz and a peak at 904 Hz (DC in the heterodyned data\nstream)\n\nthe bar, and recovering this means undoing the resonant\nresponse of the detector. This response has a long coherence time \u2013 thus long stretches of data are needed\nto resolve the narrow lines in the raw data. The strain\ndata have a much flatter spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1.\nTherefore it is practical to generate the calibrated strain\ntime series, s(t), and use that as the input to the cross\ncorrelation analysis.\nThe calibration procedure, described in detail in [21],\nis carried out in the frequency domain and consists of\nthe following: A 30 minute stretch of clean ALLEGRO\ndata is windowed and Fourier-transformed. The mechanical mode frequencies drift slightly due to small temper-\n\nOrientation\n\nA unique feature of this experiment is the ability to rotate the ALLEGRO detector and modulate the response\nof the ALLEGRO-LLO pair to a GW background [25].\nData were taken in three different orientations of ALLEGRO, known as XARM, YARM, and NULL, detailed in\nTable I. As shown in Fig. 2 and (2.4), these orientations\ncorrespond to different pair responses due to different\noverlap reduction functions. In the XARM orientation\u2013\nthe bar axis parallel to the x-arm of the interferometer\u2013\na GW signal produces positive correlation between the\ndata in the two detectors detectors. In the YARM orientation a GW signal produces an anti-correlation. In the\nNULL orientation\u2013the bar aligned halfway between the\ntwo arms of the interferometer\u2013the pair has very nearly\nzero sensitivity as a GW signal produces almost zero correlation between the detectors' data. A real signal is thus\nmodulated whereas many types of instrumental correlation would not have the same dependence on orientation.\n\nIV.\n\nCROSS-CORRELATION METHOD\n\nThis section describes the method to used to search\nfor a SGWB by cross-correlating detector outputs.

Note that while the NULL orientation represents\nperfect misalignment (\u03b3 = 0) at 0 Hz, it is not quite perfect at the frequencies of interest. This is primarily because of an\nazimuth-independent offset term in \u03b3(f ) which contributes at non-zero frequencies [25, 27]. Due to this term, it is impossible\nto orient ALLEGRO so that \u03b3(f ) = 0 at all frequencies, and to set it to zero around 915 Hz one would have to use an azimuth\nof N62\u25e6 W rather than N63\u25e6 W.\n\ncase of L1-A1 correlation measurements, it is complicated\nby the different sampling rates for the two instruments\nand the fact that the A1 data are heterodyned at 904 Hz\nprior to digitization.\n\nexpected mean\n\u03bcY\n\nc\n\nT\n= hY i \u2248\n2\nc\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne )\ndf \u03b3(|f |) Sgw (f )Q(f\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand variance\nA.\n\n\u03c3Y2 c = h(Y c \u2212 \u03bcY c )2 i \u2248\n\nContinuous-Time Idealization\n\nBoth ground-based interferometric and resonant-mass\ndetectors produce a time-series output which can be related to a discrete sampling of the signal\nsi (t) = hi (t) + ni (t)\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere i labels the detector (1 or 2 in this case), hi (t) is\nthe gravitational-wave strain defined in (2.1), and ni (t)\nis the instrumental noise associated with each detector,\nconverted into an equivalent strain.

The discrete version of Q(f\ntwo ways: first, because of the averaging used in calculating the power spectrum, the frequency resolution on the\noptimal filter was generally coarser than that associated\nwith the discrete Fourier transforms of the data streams,\nand second, the value of the optimal filter was arbitrarily set to zero outside some desired range of frequencies\nfmin \u2264 f \u2264 fmax . This was justified because the optimal\nfilter tended to have little support for frequencies outside\nthat range.\nThe present experiment has two additional complications associated with the discretization of the timeseries data. First, the A1 data are not a simple timesampling of the gravitational-wave strain, but are basebanded with a heterodyning frequency f2h = 904 Hz as\ndescribed in Sec. III B 1\u2013III B 2. Second, the A1 data\nare sampled at (\u03b4t2 )\u22121 = 250 Hz, while the L1 data are\nsampled at 16384 Hz, and subsequently downsampled to\n(\u03b4t1 )\u22121 = 4096 Hz. This would make a time-domain\ncross-correlation extremely problematic, as it would necessitate a large variety of time offsets t1 \u2212 t2 . In the\nfrequency domain, it means that the downsampled L1\ndata, once calibrated, represent frequencies ranging from\n\u22122048 Hz to 2048 Hz, while the calibrated A1 data represent frequencies ranging from (904 \u2212 125) Hz = 779 Hz\nto (904 + 125) Hz = 1029 Hz. These different frequency\nranges do not pose a problem, as long as the range of frequencies chosen for the integral satisfies fmin > 779 Hz\nand fmax < 1029 Hz. Another requirement is that for the\nchosen frequency resolution, the A1 data heterodyne reference frequency must align with a frequency bin in the\nL1 data. This is satisfied for integer-second data spans\nand integer-hertz reference frequencies. With these conditions, the Fourier transforms of the A1 and L1 data\nare both defined over a common set of frequencies, as\ndetailed in [36]. Looking at the A1 spectrum in Fig. 1, a\nreasonable range of frequencies should be a subset of the\nrange 850 Hz . f . 950 Hz.\n\n2.\n\nDiscrete-Time Cross-Correlation\n\nExplicitly, the time-series inputs to the analysis\npipeline, from each T = 60 sec of analyzed data, are:\n\n\u2022 For L1, a real time series {q1 [j]|j = 0, . . . N1 \u2212 1},\nsampled at (\u03b4t1 )\u22121 = 4096 Hz, consisting of N1 =\nT /\u03b4t1 = 245760 points. This is obtained by downsampling the raw data stream by a factor of 4.\nThe data are downsampled to 4096 Hz rather than\n2048 Hz to ensure that the rolloff of the associated anti-aliasing filter is outside the frequency\nrange being analyzed. The raw L1 data are related\nto gravitational-wave strain by the calibration ree1 (f ) constructed as described in\nsponse function R\nSec. III A.\n\n\u2022 For A1, a complex time series {sh2 [k]|k = 0, . . . N2 \u2212\n1}, sampled at (\u03b4t2 )\u22121 = 250 Hz, consisting of\nN2 = T /\u03b4t2 = 15000 points. This is calibrated\nto represent strain data as described in Sec. III B 2,\nbut still heterodyned.\n\nTo produce an approximation of the Fourier transform\nof the data from detector i, the data are multiplied by\nan appropriate windowing function, zero-padded to twice\ntheir original length, discrete-Fourier-transformed, and\nmultiplied by \u03b4ti . In addition, the L1 data are multiplied\nby a calibration response function, while the A1 data\nare interpreted as representing frequencies appropriate\nin light of the heterodyne.

We approximate the power spectra P1 (f ) using\nWelch's method [37]; as a consequence of the averaging of\nperiodograms constructed from shorter stretches of data,\nthe power spectra are estimated with a frequency resolution \u03b4f which is coarser than the 1/2T associated with\nthe construction in (4.14). As detailed in [22], we handle this by first multiplying together [e\ns1 (fl )]\u2217 and se2 (fl )\nat the finer frequency resolution, then summing together\nsets of 2T \u03b4f bins and multiplying them by the coarsergrained optimal filter. For our search, \u03b4f = 0.25 Hz and\nT = 60 sec, so 2T \u03b4f = 30.\n4.\n\nPower Spectrum Estimation\n\nBecause the noise power spectrum of the LLO can vary\nwith time, we continuously update the optimal filter used\nin the cross-correlation measurement. However, using an\noptimal filter constructed from power spectra calculated\nfrom the same data to be analyzed leads to a bias in the\ncross-correlation statistic Y , as detailed in [34]. To avoid\nthis, we analyze each T = 60 sec segment of data using an\noptimal filter constructed from the average of the power\nspectra from the segments before and after the segment\nto be analyzed. This method is known as \"sliding power\nspectrum estimation\" because, as we analyze successive\n\nsegments of data, the segments used to calculated the\nPSDs for the optimal filter slide through the data to remain adjacent. The \u03b4f = 0.25 Hz resolution is obtained\nby calculating the power spectra using Welch's method\nwith 29 overlapped 4-second sub-segments in each 60second segment of data, for a total of 58 sub-segments.\n\nV.\n\nPOST-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES\nA.\n\nStationarity Cut\n\nThe sliding power spectrum estimation method described in Sec. IV B 4 can lead to inaccurate results if the\nnoise level of one or both instruments varies widely over\nsuccessive intervals. Most problematically, if the data\nare noisy only within a single analysis segment, consideration of the power spectrum constructed from the segments before and after, which are not noisy, will cause\nthe segment to be over-weighted when combining crosscorrelation data from different segments. To avoid this,\nwe calculate for each segment both the usual estimated\nstandard deviation \u03c3I using the \"sliding\" PSD estimator\nand the \"na\u0131\u0308ve\" estimated standard deviation \u03c3I\u2032 using\nthe data from the segment itself. If the ratio of these two\nis too far from unity, the segment is omitted from the\ncross-correlation analysis. The threshold used for this\nanalysis was 20%. The amount of data excluded based\non this cut was between 1% and 2% in each of the three\norientations, and subsequent investigations show the final\nresults would not change significantly for any reasonable\nchoice of threshold.\n\nB.\n\nBias-Correction of Estimated Errorbars\n\nAlthough use of the sliding power spectrum estimator removes any bias from the optimally-filtered crosscorrelation measurement, the methods of [34] show that\nthere is still a slight underestimation of the estimated\nstandard deviation associated with the finite number of\nperiodograms averaged together in calculating the power\nspectrum. To correct for this, we have to scale up the errorbars by a factor of 1 + 1/(Navg \u00d7 9/11), where Navg is\nthe number sub-segments whose periodograms are averaged together in estimating the power spectrum for the\noptimal filter. For the data analyzed with the sliding\npower spectrum estimator, 29 overlapping four-second\nsub-segments are averaged from each of two 60-second\nsegments, for a total Navg = 58. This gives a correction\nfactor of 1+1/(58\u00d79/11) = 1.021. The \"na\u0131\u0308ve\" estimated\nsigmas, derived from power spectra calculated using 29\naverages in a single 60-second segment, are scaled up by\na factor of 1 + 1/(29 \u00d7 9/11) = 1.042.\n\n\f10\nC.\n\nCombination of Analysis Segment Results\n\nAs shown in [19], the optimal way to combine a series\nof independent cross-correlation measurements {YI } with\nassociated one-sigma errorbars is\nP \u22122\nI \u03c3I YI\n(5.1a)\nY opt = P\n\u22122\nI \u03c3I\n!\u22121/2\nX\n\u22122\n\u03c3Y opt =\n\u03c3I\n(5.1b)\nI\n\nTo minimize spectral leakage, we use Hann windows in\nour analysis segments, which would reduce the effective\nobserving time by approximately one-half, so we overlap the segments by 50% to make full use of as much\ndata as possible. This introduces correlations between\noverlapping data segments, which modifies the optimal\ncombination slightly, as detailed in [35].\nD.\n\nStatistical Interpretation\n\nThe end result of the analysis and post-processing of\na set of data is a an optimally combined complex crosscorrelation statistic Y opt with a theoretical mean of \u03a9R T\nand an associated standard deviation of \u03c3Y opt on both the\nreal and imaginary parts.

The results are similar to those from the playground, except for a lower background level, and a feature\nat the heterodyning frequency.\nThe relevant range of frequencies can be determined by\nlooking at the support of the integrand of (4.11), known\nas the sensitivity integrand. The overall sensitivity integrand, constructed as a weighted average over all the\nnon-playground data used in the analysis, is plotted in\nFig. 6. The area under this curve for a range of frequencies is proportional to that frequency range's contribution\nto \u03c3 \u22122 . We see that the integrand does indeed become\nnegligible by a frequency of 850 Hz on the lower end and\n950 Hz on the upper end. We further see that most of\nthe sensitivity comes from a 20-Hz wide band centered\naround 915 Hz.\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n10\n\n850\n\n860\n\n880\n\n890\n900\n910\nfrequency (Hz)\n\n920\n\n930\n\n940\n\n950\n\nA1L1\nS4 playground Coherence \u2212\u2212 combined orientations ZOOM\n\u22121\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n896\n\nB.\n\n870\n\n897\n\n898\n\n899\n900\n901\nfrequency (Hz)\n\n902\n\n903\n\n904\n\nCross-Correlation and Upper Limit Results\n\nAfter data quality cuts, exclusion of the \"playground\",\nand application of the stationarity cut described in\nSec.

The results are shown in Table II. No statistically significant\ncorrelation is seen in any orientation, and optimal combination of all data leads to a point estimate of 0.31 + 0.30i\nfor \u03a9R , with a one-sigma errorbar of 0.48 each on the\nreal and imaginary parts.\nThe results in Table II include the ORF describing the geometry in the optimal filter. This means\nan orientation-independent non-GW cross-correlation\npresent in the data would change sign between XARM\nand YARM, and would look much larger in the NULL\nresult. One way to remove the effects of the observing\ngeometry and compare orientation-independent crosscorrelations is to remove the \u03b3(f ) from (4.9). Since the\nORF for each orientation is nearly constant across the\nobserving band, and notably across the region of peak\n\nFIG. 4: LLO-ALLEGRO (L1-A1) coherence, calculated from\n48.66 hours of playground data spanning nearly 30 days.

Based on this,\nwe mask out the nine 0.25-Hz frequency bins around 900 Hz\nfrom our analysis.\n\nsensitivity, it is sufficient to multiply the overall results\nin each case by \u03b3(915 Hz). This is shown in Table III,\nwhere we again see no significant cross-correlation, and\nsensitivities whose relative sizes are well explained by the\ndiffering observing times.\nWe use the methods of Sec.

The narrowest likely\n90% confidence interval on \u03a9R is [0, 1.02]. We thus set an\nupper limit of 1.02 on \u03a9R = \u03a9gw (fR ), which translates to\nan upper limit on Sgw (915 Hz) of (1.5 \u00d7 10\u221223 Hz\u22121/2 )2 .\n\n\f12\n\n0\n\nSensitivity Integrand from S4 non\u2212playground data\n\nA1L1 S4 full\u2212run Coherence \u2212\u2212 combined orientations\n0.09\n\n10\n\n0.08\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nFractional Sensitivity Integrand (Hz )\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n0\n850\n\n\u22127\n\n10\n\n0.07\n\n850\n\n860\n\n870\n\n880\n\n890\n900\n910\nfrequency (Hz)\n\n920\n\n930\n\n940\n\n860\n\n870\n\n880\n\n950\n\nA1L1\nS4 full\u2212run Coherence \u2212\u2212 combined orientations ZOOM\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n890\n900\n910\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n920\n\n930\n\n940\n\n950\n\nFIG. 6: The sensitivity integrand for the data used in the\ncross-correlation analysis, normalized so its integral equals\nunity.

Further details of simulated signal generation are\nin [40].\nB.\n\nResults of Software Simulation\n\nWe performed software injections into the full S4 coincident playground, 4316 overlapping one-minute analysis segments with an effective observing time of 37.0\nhours considering the effects of Hann windows (16.7 hours\nof this is in the XARM orientation, 11.2 hours in the\nYARM orientation, and 9.0 hours in the NULL orientation). We injected constant-\u03a9gw (f ) spectra of strengths\ncorresponding to \u03a9R =1.9, 3.9, 9.6, and 19, as well as a\n\n\f14\n\u03a9R injected Point Estimate Error Bar 90% conf int\n0\n1.9\n3.9\n9.6\n19\n\n0.32 \u2212 1.00i\n2.22 \u2212 0.86i\n4.14 \u2212 0.79i\n9.89 \u2212 0.65i\n19.56 \u2212 0.49i\n\n1.54\n1.55\n1.55\n1.56\n1.58\n\n[0.00,2.74]\n[0.09,4.35]\n[1.61,6.66]\n[7.32,12.45]\n[16.96,22.15]\n\nTABLE IV: Results of software injections.

The 90% confidence\nlevel ranges are calculated without marginalizing over any\ncalibration uncertainty.\n\ntest with the SGWB amplitude set to 0 to reproduce\nthe analysis of the playground itself. Note that even\nthe strongest of these injections does not produce correlations detectable in an individual one-minute analysis\nsegment. The results are summarized in table IV. In\neach case, the actual injected value of \u03a9R is consistent\nwith the real part of the point estimate to within the\none-sigma estimated error bar; the imaginary part of the\npoint estimate remains zero to within the errorbar. The\nresults for injections at \u03a9R = 1.9 and stronger would correspond to statistical \"detections\" at the 90% or better\nconfidence level.\n\nC.\n\nResults of Hardware Injection\n\nDuring S4, a set of simulated signals was injected in\nthe hardware of ALLEGRO and LLO. These injections\nserved to test the full detection pipeline as well as the\ncalibrations of both instruments. As described in detail\nin [40], the preparation of simulated waveforms for hardware injections requires application of the transfer function of the hardware component that is actuated, such as\none of the two end test masses in LLO, to the theoretical strain for that instrument. Subsequent refinements to\ninstrumental calibration mean that the precise injected\nsignal strength is determined after the fact. Six hardware\ninjections performed during S4, each 1020 seconds long,\nhad an effective constant \u03a9gw (f ) of 8100. The series of\ninjections we call \"A\" and \"B\" were performed during\nthe XARM and NULL observation periods, respectively.\nIndependent of the physical orientation of ALLEGRO,\nthe injection and analysis was performed for three different assumed orientations, producing \"plus\" (aligned, as\nin the XARM orientation), \"minus\" (anti-aligned, as in\nYARM), and \"null\" (misaligned, as in NULL) injections\nin each series. The results (after correcting for known\nphase offsets in the injection systems) for each of the six\ninjections are shown in Table V.\nThe results show some variation of magnitude and\nphase of the point estimates, especially for the \"null\" injections. However, all the injection results are consistent\nwith the injected signal strength to within statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties. This is illustrated informally\n\nin Fig. 8, which shows the point estimates on the complex plane, each surrounded by an error circle of radius\n2.15 times the corresponding estimated errorbar. (This\nradius was chosen because 90% of the volume under a\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian falls within a circle of radius\n2.15\u03c3.) Those circles all overlap with a region centered at\nthe actual injection strength illustrating the magnitude\nand phase uncertainty in the calibration. The systematic error can be more quantitatively evaluated using the\nmethod of Sec. V E to produce a posterior PDF associated with each injection measurement. This is illustrated\nfor the optimally-combined point estimate of 7448 + 65i\nand associated estimated errorbar 47 in Fig. 9, and ranges\ncorresponding to the most likely 90% confidence range\nunder the posterior PDFs (with and without marginalization) are included in Table V. For each of the six\ninjections, as well as for the combined result, the actual\ninjected value of 8100 falls into the range after marginalization over the calibration uncertainty.\n\nVIII.\n\nCOMPARISON TO OTHER\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nThe previous most sensitive direct upper limit at the\nfrequencies probed by this experiment was set by crosscorrelating the outputs of the EXPLORER and NAUTILUS resonant bar detectors [20]. They found an upper limit on h2100 \u03a9gw (907.20 Hz) of 60. Using the value of\n72 km/s/Mpc for the Hubble constant, that translates to\na limit of 116 on \u03a9gw (907.20 Hz), upon which our limit\nof 1.02 is a hundredfold improvement.\nData from LLO, taken during S4, were also correlated with data from the LIGO Hanford Observatory\n(LHO) to set an upper limit on \u03a9gw (f ) at frequencies between 50 Hz and 150 Hz [24]. Correlations between LLO\nand LHO are not suited to measurements at high frequencies because of the effects of the ORF, illustrated\nin Fig. 2. For comparison, rough measurements using\nS4 LLO-LHO data and a band from 850 Hz to 950 Hz\nyield upper limits of around 20, while those confined to\n905 Hz \u2264 f \u2264 925 Hz (the band contributing most of the\nL1-A1 sensitivity give upper limits of around 80.\nCorrelations between the 4km and 2km IFOs at LHO,\nknown as H1 and H2, respectively, are not suppressed\nby the ORF, which is identically unity for colocated,\ncoaligned IFOs. Since H1 and L1 have comparable sensitivities, the most significant factor in comparing H1-H2\nto L1-A1 sensitivity is the relative sensitivities of A1 and\nH2. Since H2 was about a factor of 50 (in power) more\nsensitive than A1 during S4, averaged across the band\nfrom 905 Hz to 925 Hz, we would expect an H1-H2 correlation measurement during S4 to be a factor of 7 or\nbetter more sensitive than L1-A1 as a measure of \u03a9gw (f )\nat these frequencies. However, the fact that H1 and H2\nshare the same physical environment at LHO necessitates\na careful consideration of correlated noise which is ongoing [43].\n\n\f15\n\u03b3\u03a9R\n\u03b3\u03a9R\n\u03a9R\n\u03a9R Point Estimate\nInjection Error Bar Point Estimate Error Bar\nValue\nMag Phase\nA-minus\n83\n\u22126623 \u2212 126i\n93\n7403 + 141i 7404 1.1\u25e6\nA-null\n99\n205 + 19i\n3106\n6429 + 607i 6457 5.4\u25e6\nA-plus\n83\n6983 + 64i\n87\n7325 + 67i 7325 0.5\u25e6\nB-minus\n95\n\u22126845 + 49i\n106\n7650 \u2212 55i 7651 \u22120.4\u25e6\nB-null\n111\n366 \u2212 50i\n3486\n11492 \u2212 1576i 11600 \u22127.8\u25e6\nB-plus\n92\n7128 + 77i\n96\n7477 + 80i 7477 0.6\u25e6\nall\n\nN/A\n\n47\n\n7448 + 65i\n\n7448\n\n0.5\u25e6\n\nunmarg. range\nmin\nmax\n7250 7555\n1565 11294\n7182 7468\n7478 7825\n5950 17035\n7317 7634\n\nmarg. range\nmin max\n6212 8820\n1435 11562\n6146 8726\n6417 9115\n5857 17365\n6272 8907\n\n7371\n\n6256 8867\n\n7526\n\nTABLE V: Results of hardware injections. Simulated waveforms with an effective signal strength of \u03a9gw (f ) = 8100 were\ninjected coincidentally in the ALLEGRO and the LIGO-Livingston (LLO) detectors. The \"A\" and \"B\" sets of injections took\nplace during the XARM and NULL observing times, respectively. Independent of the actual orientation, the simulated signals\nwere generated and analyzed assuming different orientations: YARM, NULL, and XARM orientations were assumed for the\ninjections labelled \"minus\", \"null\", and \"plus\", respectively. The first pair of columns shows the errorbars and point estimates\nscaled by \u03b3(915 Hz) to give a \"raw\" cross-correlation as in Table III. (Note that since the \"null\" alignment represents not-quiteperfect misalignment, as noted in Table I [\u03b3(915 Hz) = 0.03 rather than zero], the injection still leads to a statistically significant\ncross-correlation even in the \"null\" orientation.) Note that the errorbars, thus scaled, are comparable for all six injections,\nwhile the level of correlation or anti-correlation depends on the orientation associated with the injection being analyzed. The\nsubsequent columns relate to the standard cross-correlation statistic, with the ORF included in the optimal filter, so the\nrelative insensitivity in the \"null\" alignment is reflected in large errorbars, while the point estimates are all positive and in the\nvicinity of the injected value of 8100. All point estimates given include corrections for known phase offsets associated with the\ninjection system. The row labelled \"all\" gives the optimally-weighted combination of all six results. The point estimates and\none-sigma estimated errorbars were combined to give 90% confidence ranges with and without marginalization over calibration\nuncertainty, mimicking the statistical analysis described in Sec. V D and V E.\n\nWork is also currently underway to search for a SGWB\nat frequencies around 900 Hz by correlating data from\nthe Virgo IFO with the resonant bar detectors AURIGA,\nEXPLORER, and NAUTILUS [44].\nFinally, an indirect limit can be set on SGWB strength\ndue to the energy density in the associated gravitational\nwaves themselves, which is given by\nZ \u221e\n\u03a9gw (f )\n\u03c1gw = \u03c1crit\ndf\n(8.1)\nf\n0\nThe most stringent limit is on a cosmological SGWB, set\nby the success of big-bang nucleosynthesis, is \u03c1gw /\u03c1crit \u2264\n1.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 [3]. In comparison, a background of the\nstrength constrained by our measurement, \u03a9R = 1.02,\nwould contribute about 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 to \u03c1gw /\u03c1crit , if it were\nconfined to the most sensitive region between 905 Hz\nand 925 Hz. (Spread over the full range of integration\n850 Hz \u2264 f \u2264 950 Hz, it would contribute 1 \u00d7 10\u22121 .)\nNote, however, that this nucleosynthesis bound is not\nrelevant for a SGWB of astrophysical origin.\n\nIX.\n\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\n\nLIGO's S5 science run began in November 5 with the\naim of collecting one year of coincident data at LIGO\ndesign sensitivity. ALLEGRO has also been in operation over that time period, so the measurement documented in this paper could be repeated with S5 data.\nSuch a measurement would be more sensitive due to L1's\n\nroughly fivefold reduction in strain noise power at 900 Hz\nbetween S4 and S5, and because of the larger volume of\ndata (roughly 20 times as much). Those two improvements could combine to lead to an improvement of about\nan order of magnitude in \u03a9R sensitivity. However, no\nimmediate plans exist to carry out an analysis with S5\ndata, because this incremental quantitative improvement\nin sensitivity would still leave us far from the level needed\nto detect a cosmological background consistent with the\nnucleosynthesis bound, or an astrophysical background\narising from a realistic model.\nAdditionally, the greater sensitivity of the H1-H2 pair\nmeans that a background detectable with L1-A1 would\nfirst be seen in H1-H2. In the event that a \"surprise\" correlation is seen in H1-H2 which cannot be attributed to\nnoise, correlation measurements such as LLO-ALLEGRO\nand Virgo-AURIGA could be useful for confirming or ruling out a gravitational origin.\n\nX.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have reported the results of the first truly heterogeneous cross-correlation measurement to search for\na stochastic gravitational-wave background. While the\nupper limit of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221223 Hz\u22121/2 on the strain of the\nSGWB corresponds to a hundredfold improvement over\nthe previous direct upper limit on \u03a9gw (f ) in this frequency band [20], the amplitude of conceivable spectral\nshapes is already constrained more strongly by results at\nother frequencies [23, 24].

Each of the six point estimates of \u03a9R is plotted on the complex plane,\nwith an associated error circle of 2.15 times the estimated one-sigma errorbar. (This contains 90% of the volume under the\ncorresponding likelihood surface.) The five-pointed star indicates the actual injected level of \u03a9R = 8100. The dashed teardropshaped region indicates the calibration uncertainty, corresponding to a 2.15-sigma ellipse in log-amplitude/phase space.

The plot on the right (in which\nthe edge of the dashed calibration uncertainty teardrop can just be seen) shows that the \"plus\" and \"minus\" injections are\nall statistically consistent with each other, and consistent with the injection when systematic uncertainties associated with\ncalibration are taken into account.\n\nis thus more likely the overcoming of technical challenges\nof cross-correlating data streams from instruments with\nsignificantly different characteristics. Most obviously, we\nperformed a coherent analysis of data from resonant-mass\nand interferometric data, but additionally the data were\nsampled at different rates, ALLEGRO data were heterodyned and therefore complex in the time domain, and\nentirely different methods were used for the calibrations\nof both instruments. Lessons learned from this analysis\nwill be valuable not only for possible collaborations between future generations of detectors of different types,\nbut also between interferometers operated by different\ncollaborations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nParticle Physics and Astronomy Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom, the Max-Planck-Society and the State\nof Niedersachsen/Germany for support of the construction and operation of the GEO600 detector.
