Recently, the positron channel has received a lot of attention, since the PAMELA collaboration has released the\ndata relative to the positron fraction [1] that exhibit a\nspectacular rise, which is in agreement with earlier results from AMS-01 [2] and HEAT [3, 4, 5], and compatible with the claimed 300\u2212800 GeV excess in the electron plus positron spectrum measured by ATIC-2 balloon\nflights [6]. Lying in the energy range & 10 GeV, such an\nexcess has prompted a large number of papers putting\nforward explanations that include DM annihilations or\ndecays in the galaxy, and nearby astrophysical objects\nlike pulsars.\nHere, we consider the DM annihilation hypothesis\nand perform a multi-messenger analysis in order to constrain the properties of viable DM candidates. More\nspecifically, we study positrons, antiprotons, \u03b3-rays and\nsynchrotron emission due to the propagation of elec-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: pato@iap.fr\n\u2020 Electronic address: pieri@iap.fr\n\u2021 Electronic address: bertone@iap.fr\n\ntrons and positrons in the Galactic magnetic field. The\nmulti-messenger approach has already provided useful\nconstraints on DM scenarios. For instance, the nonobservation of an excess of cosmic-ray antiprotons up\nto \u223c 100 GeV by the PAMELA satellite [7] indicates\nthat hadronic annihilation channels should be strongly\nsuppressed. This motivates a simple distinction between\nDM candidates: leptophilic, i.e. that annihilate mainly\ninto lepton pairs, and hadrophilic, whose annihilation\nfinal states are gauge bosons or quark pairs and induce non-negligible fluxes of both positrons and antiprotons. Obviously, the former override p\u0304 bounds, while\nthe latter need to be rather heavy in order to suppress\np\u0304 fluxes below \u223c 100 GeV, but predict inevitably larger\nfluxes at higher energies, that should be soon probed.\nOther interesting messengers for DM searches are highenergy neutrinos. In fact, neutrino observatories such as\nSuper-Kamiokande [8] and IceCube [9] are able to detect\nupward-going muons produced in the interaction of highenergy neutrinos within the Earth interior. Therefore,\nonce the DM profile is fixed, neutrino observations of the\nGalactic Centre region effectively constrain the properties of dark matter, especially for multi-TeV candidates\n\u2212 see e.g. [10, 11].\nAlternative detection strategies include searches for\nnew physics in accelerators, and direct detection experiments, searching for keV nuclei recoils due to dark matter scattering off nuclei (see e.g. Refs. [12]). A convinc-\n\n\f2\ning identification of DM can probably be achieved only\nthrough a combination of different detection strategies.\nNow, if one assumes that DM candidates are thermal\nrelics from the early universe, the present annihilation\ncross section needs to be \u03c3ann v \u223c O(10\u221226 ) cm3 s\u22121 in\norder to produce the observed relic abundance \u03a9cdm h2 \u223c\n0.1. Such a thermal relic with a TeV mass needs a\n\u223c 103 boost in the annihilation flux to accommodate\nthe PAMELA excess [13], which can hardly be provided by the \"clumpiness\" of the Galactic halo (see below for a thorough discussion). Non-thermal relics, nonstandard cosmologies, or velocity dependent (\"Sommerfeld enhanced\") annihilation cross-sections, have been invoked to circumvent this problem, but the question remains of whether the large cross-sections needed to explain the positron data can be made consistent with other\nastrophysical observations. We perform here an extensive analysis of the multi-messenger constraints in the\nframework of the latest high-resolution numerical simulations of a Milky Way like halo. We explore two specific classes of models: leptohilic candidates, inspired in\nRefs. [14, 15], and hadrophilic candidates, with a specific\nemphasis on models of Ref. [16]. For all these models\nwe compute the flux of: i) positrons, ii) anti-protons,\niii) gamma-rays from the Galactic Centre, iv) gammarays from the Galactic halo, and v) synchrotron emission\ndue to the propagation of electrons and positrons at the\nGalactic Centre. We take into account the dependence of\nthe annihilation cross section on the relative velocity. In\nparticular, we calculate the boost factor due to Sommerfeld enhanced substructures, in the framework of the Via\nLactea II [17] and Aquarius [18] simulations, and we discuss the consequences for the gamma-ray flux from DM\nannihilations in Galactic and extragalactic halos.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we specify our prescriptions for the distribution of DM, including the mass-function and concentration of DM clumps.\nIn Sec. III, we introduce the DM candidates used in the\nanalysis. Sections IV to VII are then devoted to compute\nfluxes in the different channels under scrutiny: positrons,\nantiprotons, \u03b3-rays and synchrotron. The main conclusions are drawn in the last section.\n\nconcentration on the position inside the halo, as we will\nsoon explain.\nThe smooth density profile is well modelled, in the VL2\nand Aquarius scenarios, by:\n\u03c1VsmL2 (r) =\n\n\u00112 ,\n1 + rrs\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\n2\nr\nAq\n\u2212 1 , \u03b1 = 0.17,\n\u03c1sm (r) = \u03c1s exp \u2212\n\u03b1\nrs\n\nASTROPHYSICAL INPUT\n\nr\nrs\n\nbeing r the distance to the galactic centre. The local\ndensity is \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1sm (r ) with r = 8 kpc. Following\n[19], the NFW profile of Via Lactea II is considered to\nsaturate at a radius rsat such that \u03c1sm (rsat ) \u2261 \u03c1sat =\n2 * 1018 M kpc\u22123 .\nThe density profiles inside clumps are NFW in Via\nLactea II and Einasto with \u03b1 = 0.17 in Aquarius.

In this\nway, the clump inner density profile \u03c1cl (M, r, r0 ) is unambiguously defined once the clump mass M and the\ndistance to the galactic centre r are specified.

In the\nformer, both smooth and clumpy components are well\nfitted by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles and the\nabundance of subhalos follows the rather steep behaviour\nM \u22122 , while in the latter the density profiles seem to be\nEinasto-like and a shallower subhalo abundance \u221d M \u22121.9\nis found.

In the following, we will refer to\nthese expressions as \u03c1sh .\nThe normalization Ash is fixed according to the findings of numerical simulations. In the VL2 case, we impose that 10 % of the galaxy mass Mvir is virialized in\nstructures with mass in the range [10\u22125 Mvir , 10\u22122 Mvir ].\nIn the case of Aquarius, we require that 13.2 % of Mvir is\n\n\f3\nVL2\nAq.\n\n1  \u0301 108\n\nNcl <\u039e>M @kpc3D\n\n5  \u0301 107\n\n1  \u0301 107\n5  \u0301 106\n\n1  \u0301 106\n5  \u0301 105\n-20\n\n-10\n-15\n-5\nlog10 Mmin\u0090Msun\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The quantity Ncl h\u03beiM as a function of\nMmin for Via Lactea II (solid red line) and Aquarius (dashed\nblue line).

For supersymmetric neutralinos, for example, it varies in the interval 10\u221212 \u2212 10\u22123 M [20], but it may also be much\nlarger or smaller. We choose to fix Mmin = 10\u22126 M\nwhich is a typical value for WIMPs [21]. As will be\nshown in sections IV and V the positron and antiproton\nclumpy fluxes scale with the quantity Ncl h\u03beiM , where\nR Mmax\nM\nh\u03beiM = Mmin\ndM dP\ndM (M )\u03be(M, r ). Thus, for a given\nsubhalo population (either Via Lactea II or Aquarius) a\ndifferent value of Mmin may be accounted for by scaling\nthe e+ and p\u0304 clumpy contributions according to figure 1.\nOther relevant quantities are the total mass in clumps\nR Mmax\ntot\nM\nMcl\n= Ncl Mmin\ndM M dP\ndM , the local clump fraction\nf\n\n=\n\ntot\nMcl\ndPV\n\u03c1\ndV\n\ntot\n(r ) and the total clump fraction fcl\n=\n\ntot\nMcl\n\nMvir .

The three blocks refer to parameters of 1) the\nsmooth galactic halo, 2) the concentration parameter and 3)\nthe galactic subhalo population. Notice that we are setting\ntot\ntot\n.\n, f and fcl\nMmin = 10\u22126 M to compute Ncl , h\u03beiM , Mcl\n\nclaimed by ATIC have prompted the interest of the\nparticle physics community, and motivated the quest\nfor DM models leading to enhanced DM fluxes. Among\nthem, strong emphasis has been put on the Sommerfeld\nenhancement [22], arising from the presence of an\nattractive potential, that for low relative velocities leads\nto a peculiar behaviour of the annihilation cross section\n\u03c3ann v \u221d 1/v down to a given vsat , below which \u03c3ann v\nsaturates. In this scheme, one can have dark matter particles that at chemical decoupling \u2212 when v \u223c O(0.1c)\n\u2212 presented the appropriate annihilation cross section of\nweak strength, (\u03c3ann v)0 \u223c O(10\u221226 ) cm3 s\u22121 , and today,\nin the galactic halo, have a much higher \u03c3ann v since the\nlocal velocity dispersion is \u03b2 = v /c \u223c 5 * 10\u22124 . The\nsubscript 0 in \u03c3ann v denotes the value of the annihilation cross section without Sommerfeld corrections. The\nSommerfeld effect typically leads to small corrections of\nthe annihilation cross section at decoupling [23], while\nboosting significantly local anti-matter fluxes. Notice\nthat the relic abundance of a Sommerfeld-enhanced DM\nparticle may be reduced w.r.t. the standard case by a\nfactor of order unity: indeed, in Ref. [23] the authors\nhave computed the thermal relic abundance of wino-like\nneutralinos including Sommerfeld corrections and found\na reduction of about 50% compared to the standard\ncalculation.\nThe Sommerfeld enhancement is rather modeldependent and thus we choose a few examples in the\nliterature, shown in table II. These do not cover all the\npossibilities but are meant to be representative benchmarks. We consider specific implementations of ArkaniHamed et al. [14] and Nomura & Thaler [15] models\nas leptophilic-like candidates. In the former, the dark\nmatter particle annihilates into pairs of scalars or vec-\n\n\f4\nlabel\n\u0003 AH700\n\u2022 NT1\n\u25e6 NT2\n? \u03bc\u03bc\n\u0004 \u03c4\u03c4\n\u00d7 MDM3\n\u2297 MDM5\n\nRef. mDM /TeV m\u03c6,s /GeV (\u03c3ann v)0 /(10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 )\nannihilation channel\n[14]\n0.70\n0.10 (\u03c6)\n3\n\u03c6\u03c6; \u03c6 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\n[15]\n1.00\n34.0 (s)\n3\nsa; s \u2192 97%aa, 3%bb\u0304; a \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n[15]\n1.20\n5.60 (s)\n3\nsa; s \u2192 95%aa, 5%\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 ; a \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n[26]\n1.60\n\u2212\n3\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n[27]\n2.00\n\u2212\n3\n\u03c4 +\u03c4 \u2212\n[16]\n2.70\n\u2212\n\u223c1\nW W, ZZ\n[16]\n9.60\n\u2212\n\u223c1\nW W, ZZ\n\nS(v )\n43\n100\n100\n1100\n1000\n273\n1210\n\nSmax\n762\n100\n100\n1100\n1000\n273\n1210\n\nTABLE II: Properties of DM candidates recently proposed in the literature and presenting Sommerfeld-enhanced cross sections.\nThe label of each model is preceded by the corresponding symbol to be used in the plots of the next sections.\n\ntor bosons \u03c6 which then decay into muons or electrons.\nWe use m\u03c6 = 100 MeV (that means \u03c6 decays entirely\ninto e+ e\u2212 ) and put \u03b1 = \u03bb2 /(4\u03c0) = 0.01. As for Nomura & Thaler models, dark matter annihilates into a\nscalar s and an axion a. We implement the two benchmarks of [15] where s decays mainly into a pair of axions but has small branching ratios to bb\u0304 and \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 \u2212 see\ntable II. The axion a is assumed to decay entirely into\nmuons. Placing Nomura & Thaler models on figure 6\nof [14], one sees that the Sommerfeld enhancement is already saturated at v = v and reads \u223c 100 \u2212 300. We\nset S(v ) = Smax = 100 and note that taking a different value is equivalent to rescale (\u03c3ann v)0 since we are\nlying in the saturation regime. Lastly, inspired by the\nrecently published electron plus positron spectrum from\nFermi [24] and HESS [25], the authors of Ref. [26] propose an 1.6 TeV particle annihilating into \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , which\nfits well Fermi, HESS and PAMELA data given an enhancement of 1100. Even though such enhancement is\nnot necessarily due to Sommerfeld corrections, we consider this candidate setting S(v ) = Smax = 1100. Similarly, we also analyse a 2 TeV particle annihilating into\n\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with S(v ) = Smax = 1000 [27].\nFor hadrophilic candidates we adopt the case of minimal dark matter [16], namely the fermion triplet and\nquintuplet. All examples displayed in table II are Majorana fermions.\nEssential ingredients to proceed further are the energy\nspectra dN/dE of positrons, antiprotons and photons\nproduced in dark matter annihilations. Arkani-Hamed et\nal. models feature particles that annihilate in an 1-step\ncascade into e+ e\u2212 ; the relevant formulae for the positron\nspectrum are given in Appendix A of [28]. The Nomura\n& Thaler cases considered here annihilate mainly in an\n1.5-step cascade into \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u2212 which is basically half an 1step cascade and half a 2-step cascade \u2212 and the referred\nappendix gives the necessary expressions for dNe+ /dEe+ .\nThe corrections due to the branching ratios into bb\u0304 or\n\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 are introduced in the following way: from DarkSUSY\ncode version 5.0.4 [29] we take the positron spectra for the\nmentioned channels and mDM = 10 GeV (corresponding\nto ms = 20 GeV). Then, following [28], we convolute\nthem to give the dNe+ /dEe+ in the centre of mass of\nthe DM annihilations. The same procedure is applied for\ndNp\u0304 /dTp\u0304 in the bb\u0304 case. With the small branching ratios\n\ninto \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 and bb\u0304 presented in table II, the positron spectra\nobtained in this way are very similar to the ones obtained\nin a pure 1.5-step cascade. However, an important difference is a non-zero yield of antiprotons (that will turn\nout to be small) and possibly significant \u03b3-ray production. Lastly, energy spectra from minimal dark matter\nannihilations are given in reference [16] for x & 10\u22124 .\nWe implement the e+ and p\u0304 spectrum of [16] down to\nx = 10\u22124 and a flat dN/dE is assumed below that. This\nfeature does not affect our conclusions. Indeed, the main\nresults will depend on dNe+ /dEe+ for energies above 50\nGeV which are within the range of validity of all spectra\nused. Radio fluxes will depend on the number of electrons and positrons above \u223c 0.1 \u2212 10 GeV; for minimal\ndark matter \u2212 where we have implemented a flat dN/dE\nbelow a given x \u2212 the number of e\u00b1 will then be underestimated and our radio fluxes for those candidates are\nlower bounds.\n\nIV.\n\nPOSITRONS\n\nUnlike neutral particles, positrons produced in the\nMilky Way undergo different processes that change their\ndirection and energy while crossing the galactic medium.\nThe galactic magnetic fields, for instance, are responsible for deflection and, due to their (poorly known) inhomogeneities, the evolution of a positron can be treated\nas a random walk with a certain diffusion coefficient\nKe+ . Other important phenomena are energy losses\nthrough inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background and starlight and synchrotron emission, which proceed at a space-independent rate b(Ee+ ) '\nEe2+ /(GeV * \u03c4E ) with \u03c4E ' 1016 s [30, 31]. Neglecting\ngalactic convective winds and diffusive reacceleration, the\nd2 N\nnumber density per unit energy ne+ (t, x, Ee+ ) \u2261 dV dEe++\ne\nfollows the diffusion equation [30, 31]\n\u2202ne+\n\u2212Ke+ (Ee+ )\u22072 ne+\n\u2202t\n\u2202\n\u2212\n(b(Ee+ )ne+ ) = Qe+ (x, Ee+ ) , (2)\n\u2202Ee+\nand we are interested in positrons from annihilations of\ndark matter particles with mass mDM and density \u03c1DM\n\n\f5\nL [kpc] K0 [kpc2 /Myr]\nM2\n1\n0.00595\nMIN\n1\n0.0016\nMED\n4\n0.0112\nMAX\n15\n0.0765\n\n+\n\ne\nIsm\n(\u03bbD ) is the dimensionless halo function and is given\nby\n\u0012\n\u00132\nZ\n+\n\u03c1sm (x)\ne+\nIsm\n(\u03bbD ) =\nd3 x\nGe (x, \u03bbD ) ,\n(5)\n\u03c1\nDZ\n\n\u03b4 Vc [km/s]\n0.55\n\u2212\n0.85\n13.5\n0.70\n12.0\n0.46\n5.0\n\nTABLE III: Sets of propagation parameters yielding maximal,\nmean and minimal anti-matter fluxes [31, 32].\n\ncorresponding to the source term\n\u00132 X\n\ndNek+\n(E + ) ,\ndEe+ e\nk\n(3)\nwhere the 1/2 factor is valid for Majorana selfannihilating fermions. The fluxes induced by Dirac\nfermions, bosons or other particles may be obtained from\nour results by a simple rescaling.\nThe standard approach to solve (2) for ne+ is to assume steady state conditions (i.e. \u2202ne+ /\u2202t = 0) and\nadopt a cylindrical diffusion halo with radius Rgal = 20\nkpc and a half-thickness L inside which the diffusion coefficient is supposed to be space-independent [30, 31],\n\u03b4\nKe+ (Ee+ ) ' K0 (Ee+ /GeV) . The half-thickness L extends much further than the half-thickness of the galactic disk h ' 0.1 kpc and ne+ vanishes at the cylinder\nboundaries since the particles escape to the intergalactic medium. The propagation model is defined by the\nset of parameters (L, K0 , \u03b4) which turn out to be loosely\nconstrained by cosmic ray data, namely B/C measurements. Following [31, 32] we use the sets of parameters\nlabelled M2, MIN, MED and MAX in table III that are\nlikely to reflect the propagation uncertainty on dark matter induced anti-matter fluxes. M2 (MIN) is the set that\nminimises the positron (antiproton) flux. The value of\nthe galactic wind speed will be used in the antiproton\nanalysis while being neglected here.\nOnce the steady state solution is found, the flux of\nve+\npositrons is given by \u03c6e+ (x, Ee+ ) = 4\u03c0\nne+ (x, Ee+ ). We\ndisregard solar modulation, since it is unimportant for\nmulti-GeV positrons. Following [19, 30], the positron\nflux at Earth due to the smooth dark matter component\nof the Milky Way is\n1\nQe+ (x, Ee+ ) =\n2\n\n\u03c60e+ ,sm (E) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1DM (x)\nmDM\n\nwhere DZ stands for the cylindrical diffusive zone and\n+\nGe is the Green function evaluated at the solar neighbourhood:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n+\n(x \u2212 x )2 + (y \u2212 y )2\n1\n\u00d7\nGe (x, \u03bbD ) = 2 exp \u2212\n\u03c0\u03bbD\n\u03bb2D\n\nh\u03c3ann vik0\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\nve + 1 1\n\u03c1\n\u00d7\n4\u03c0 b(E) 2 mDM\nZ \u221e\ne+\ne+\ndES finj\n(ES ) Ism\n(\u03bbD (E, ES )) ,\n\n(4)\n\nE\n\nwhere the sun is at (x , y , z ) = (8, 0, 0) kpc, ve+ /c =\n\u00011/2\nP\ndN k\ne+\n1 \u2212 m2e /E 2\nand finj\n(ES ) = k h\u03c3ann vik0 dEe++ (ES ).\ne\n\u03bbD (E, ES ) is the positron diffusion length from a source\nenergy ES down to a detection energy E \u2264 ES and reads\nv\n!\nu\nu 4K0 \u03c4E \u0012 E \u0013\u03b4\u22121 \u0012 ES \u0013\u03b4\u22121\nt\n\u03bbD (E, ES ) =\n\u2212\n.\n1\u2212\u03b4\nGeV\nGeV\n\n+\n\nGe1D (z, \u03bbD ) ,\n+\n\nwith Ge1D given in [19] (and references therein) for the\nlimiting cases L > \u03bbD and L \u2264 \u03bbD .\nThe contribution from one single clump is very similar\nto the smooth one replacing \u03c1sm with \u03c1cl in equation (5).\nHowever, we are interested in the signal from a population of subhalos distributed throughout the galaxy in a\nd2 Nsh\ndPM dPV\ncertain range of masses, say dM\ndV = Ncl dM dV . Considering every clump a point source and given the local\ncharacter of the Green function, the mean positron flux\nfrom the clumpy dark matter component in the galaxy is\n[19]\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03c1\nve + 1 1\n0\nh\u03c6e+ ,cl i(E) =\nNcl h\u03beiM \u00d7\n4\u03c0 b(E) 2 mDM\nZ \u221e\n+\ne+\ndES finj\n(ES ) hGe iV (\u03bbD (E, ES )) ,\n(6)\nE\n\nwhere\n+\n\nhGe iV (\u03bbD ) =\n\nZ\nDZ\n\n+\n\nd3 x Ge (x, \u03bbD )\n\ndPV\n(x)\ndV\n\nand h\u03beiM was introduced in section II. Equation (6) is\nvalid if the density profile of the clump does not depend\non its position within the Milky Way. Therefore, we set\nc200 (M ) \u2261 c200 (M, r ) which is anyway reasonable for\nour analysis since multi-GeV positrons detected at the\nEarth travelled at most a few kpc [30].\nNext we include Sommerfeld corrections. The smooth\ncontribution \u03c60e+ ,sm will be boosted by S(v ) given the\nlocal origin of high-energy positrons. As far as clumps\nare concerned, we assume that the whole population of\nsubhalos presents velocity dispersions below vsat which\nmeans the clumpy contribution h\u03c60e+ ,cl i will be roughly\nrescaled by Smax . Such simplification is conservative in\nthe sense that we maximise the contribution of substructures \u2212 indeed, clumps with masses close to Mmax =\n1010 M may not be in the saturation regime, but that\nwould lead to an enhancement smaller than Smax . In this\nframework and following [19], the total positron flux at\nEarth for a specific dark matter candidate and a certain\npropagation model is\n\u03c6e+ (E) = (1\u2212f )2 S(v ) \u03c60e+ ,sm (E) + Smax h\u03c60e+ ,cl i(E) .\n(7)\n\n\f6\nVL2\nAq.\n\nVL2\nsmooth\n\nsmooth\n\n10-6\npositron flux @GeV-1cm-2s-1sr-1D\n\npositron flux @GeV-1cm-2s-1sr-1D\n\n10-6\n\n10-8\nclumps\n\u0081\n\n10-10\n\n10-8\n\n10-10\n\n10-12\n\n10-12\nMAX\nMED\nM2\n\n10-14\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n1.5\nlog10 E\u0090GeV\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n10-14\n\n10-8\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n2.0\n1.5\nlog10 E\u0090GeV\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n10-8\nVL2\n\nVL2\nAq.\n\nsmooth\n\nsmooth\n\nantiproton flux @GeV-1cm-2s-1sr-1D\n\n10-9\n\nantiproton flux @GeV-1cm-2s-1sr-1D\n\n10-9\n\n10-10\n\n10-10\n\nclumps\n\n10-11\n\n10-11\n\n10-12\n\n10-12\n\n10-13\n\n10-14\n\n0.0\n\n10-13\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n1.5\nlog10 T\u0090GeV\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The Sommerfeld-enhanced fluxes (1 \u2212\nf )2 S(v )\u03c60sm and Smax h\u03c60cl i of positrons and antiprotons for\nthe MDM3 candidate.

Differently from\npositrons, antiprotons do not lose much energy by synchrotron or inverse Compton since mp \u001d me . Instead, they may be swept away by galactic winds, assumed to be constant and perpendicular to the disk:\n~c (x) = sgn(z)Vc~ez . Furthermore, annihilations pp\u0304 are\nV\nresponsible for the disappearance of primary antiprotons. These annihilations take place essentially along\nthe galactic plane where the interstellar medium is concentrated, and therefore the diffusion equation for anp\u0304\npp\u0304\ntiprotons contains a term \u22122h\u03b4D (z)\u0393pann\nnp\u0304 with \u0393ann\n=\n2/3\npp\u0304\n\u22123\n(nH + 4 nHe )\u03c3ann vp\u0304 , nH ' 0.9 cm , nHe ' 0.1 cm\u22123\n[33] and\npp\u0304\n\u03c3ann\n(Tp\u0304 ) =\n\u001a\n661(1 + 0.0115Tp\u0304\u22120.774 \u2212 0.948Tp\u03040.0151 ) Tp\u0304 < 15.5\n,\n36Tp\u0304\u22120.5\nTp\u0304 \u2265 15.5\npp\u0304\nis in mbarn, Tp\u0304 = Ep\u0304 \u2212 mp is the antiproton\nwhere \u03c3ann\nkinetic energy and is in units of GeV in the above forpp\u0304 \u0001\u03b4\nmula.

Figure 4 shows the total positron and\nantiproton fluxes at 50 GeV for the models in table II\nand assuming the MED propagation configuration and\nMmin = 10\u22126 M . We see immediately that some models violate the positron and/or antiproton data. However, all candidates may present (\u03c3ann v)0 a few times\nmore or less than presented in table II, which accounts\nfor a scaling along diagonals in figure 4 since a change of\n(\u03c3ann v)0 modifies equally the positron and the antiproton fluxes. Conservatively, we are interested in knowing\nwhich points in figure 4 may be rescaled to touch the left\nvertical line without being above the upper horizontal\nline. In other words, we wish to pin down the particles\nthat can meet the PAMELA positron excess without violating antiproton bounds. Candidates lying above the\ndiagonal line in figure 4 cannot. For the DM distribution\nsuggested by Via Lactea II the model labelled MDM3 is\ndisfavoured. The situation for Aquarius is similar, but\nmore constraining. Lastly, leptophilic candidates produce no antiprotons and automatically pass the p\u0304 test;\nthey are plotted in figure 4 for completeness and with an\nartificial \u03c6p\u0304 . The exception is NT1 model that features\na non-zero BR(s \u2192 bb\u0304), even though the corresponding\nantiproton flux is rather low.\nAs mentioned above, figure 4 refers to the MED propagation parameters. From figure 3 one sees that at 50 GeV\nthe positron flux is not very sensitive to the propagation\nparameters, while the antiproton flux at 50 GeV may be\nroughly one order of magnitude above or below the flux\ncomputed with MED. Since the antiproton bound will\nturn out to be the less constraining one, we can safely\nstick to the mean propagation in presenting our main\nresults.\nNext we proceed with constraints coming from \u03b3-ray\nobservations.\n\u001a\n\nVI.\n\nGAMMA-RAYS\n\nThe expected \u03b3-ray flux from DM annihilation is proportional to the line of sight integral (LOS) of the DM\ndensity square \u03c12\u03c7 \u2212 which tells us how many annihilations we have in the cone of view defined by the ex-\n\n(13)\nFor each halo along our line of sight, M is the mass\nand d the distance from the observer. dN\u03b3f /dE\u03b3 is the\ndifferential spectrum per annihilation of prompt photons\n[35, 36] relative to the final state f , with branching ratio\nBf . The volume integral refers to the line of sight and\nis defined by the angular resolution of the instrument \u03b8\nand by the direction \u03c8 of observation. Inside each halo,\nR is the distance from the centre. \u03c1\u03c7 (M, R, c(M, R))\nis the DM density profile with concentration parameter\nc(M, r).\nWhen including the Sommerfeld enhancement of the\nlocal annihilation cross section, the term \u03c3ann v in eq.\n(13) is replaced by the velocity-dependent expression\n(\u03c3ann v)0 S(R, M ). The enhancement S depends on the\nhalo mass fixing the average velocity dispersion, and from\nthe radial coordinate inside the halo, which takes into account the features of the velocity dispersion curve that\nhas lower values closer to the centre of the galaxy hosted\nby the DM halo \u2212 see e.g. [37].\nThe enhancement will be included in the line of sight\nintegral, which transforms into\n\u03a6LOS\nS\n\nZ\n=\n\nS(M, R)\u03c12\u03c7 (M, c, R)\ndV .\nd2\n\n(14)\n\nIn the next paragraphs we will compute the prompt \u03b3rays coming from DM annihilation in 1) the smooth halo\nof our galaxy, 2) the substructures of our galaxy and 3)\nthe extragalactic halos and subhalos.\n\nA.\n\nAnnihilations in the smooth MW halo\n\nThe astrophysical contribution to the prompt \u03b3-ray\nemission from the smooth component of a DM halo can\nbe rewritten as the volume integral\n\"\n#\nZ Z Z\nS(M, R)\u03c12\u03c7 (M, R)\n\u03a6S (M, d, \u03c8, \u2206\u03a9) \u221d\nd\u03c6d\u03b8d\u03bb\n\u03bb2\nV\nwhere \u03bb is the line-of-sight coordinate, \u2206\u03a9 the solid angle\ncorresponding to the angular resolution \u03b8 of the instrument, and \u03c8 the angle of view from the GC.

To account for gravitational\ntides, we follow [40] and assume that all the mass beyond\nthe subhalo tidal radius is lost in a single orbit without\naffecting its central density profile. The tidal radius is\ndefined as the distance from the subhalo centre at which\nthe tidal forces of the host potential equal the self-gravity\nof the subhalo. In the Roche limit, it is expressed as:\n\u0012\nrtid (r) =\n\nMsub\n2Mh (< r)\n\n\u00131/3\nr\n\n(17)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the halo centre, Msub the\nsubhalo mass and Mh (< r) the host halo mass enclosed\nin a sphere of radius r.

(15).\nThe result of our computations is shown in figure 6, where\nthe expected flux from the subhalos is compared with the\nEGRET diffuse emission (galactic + extragalactic) background. Although the EGRET flux has been rescaled\nby \u223c15% in the light of the new measurement from the\nFermi telescope which does not confirm the GeV bump,\nthe diffuse emission measurements turn out to be less\nconstraining than the GC one.\n\nAq.\n10-10\n\nHESS GC\n\nphoton flux @cm-2s-1D\n\nwhere\nthe\ncontribution\nfrom\neach\nsubhalo\n\u03a6halo\n(M,\nS(M,\nR),\nc(M,\nR),\nd,\n\u03c8,\n\u2206\u03a9)\nis\nconvolved\nS\nwith its distribution function inside the galaxy \u03c1sh .

Note that our bounds refer to\nprompt \u03b3-rays only. However, DM annihilations in extragalactic halos and subhalos can also give rise to a \u03b3-ray\nflux by producing high-energy electrons and positrons\nthat up-scatter CMB photons. This inverse Compton\n\nSYNCHROTRON RADIATION\n\nSynchrotron emission arises from relativistic electrons\nand positrons propagating in the galactic magnetic field.\nSince all annihilation channels usually considered produce high-energy electrons and positrons, a DM-induced\nsynchrotron signal is expected from regions of the galaxy\nwhere a substantial magnetic field is active and the dark\nmatter density is significant \u2212 see e.g. [36, 51, 52]. Let\nus focus on a region towards the galactic centre, small\nenough so that diffusion does not play an important role\nand where the galactic magnetic field is strong enough to\nneglect electron (and positron) energy losses other than\nsynchrotron emission. Assuming further that advection\nis negligible as in [36, 52], equation (2) is easily solved in\nsteady-state conditions for positrons and electrons:\nh\u03c3ann vi 2\nN \u00b1 (> E)\n\u03c1\n(x) e\n,\n(29)\n2m2DM DM\nbsyn (x, E)\nRm\ndN \u00b1\nwhere Ne\u00b1 (> E) = E DM dE 0 dEe\u00b1\n(E 0 ) is the number\ne\nof electrons plus positrons per DM annihilation above a\ngiven energy E, bsyn (x, E) ' e4 B 2 (x)E 2 /(9\u03c0m4e ) and B\nis the galactic magnetic field.

We use the measured fluxes quoted in\n[53]. It turns out that, independently of the annihilation\nchannel, case 1 gives the most stringent bounds when\nusing the NFW smooth profile suggested by Via Lactea II\nsimulation. For the Aquarius simulation and its Einasto\nsmooth profile, case 2 is the most constraining one.\nIn principle, for DM particles with Sommerfeldenhanced cross sections, a full calculation of the synchrotron emission should include the enhancement S(v)\ninside the integral in expression (31). Nevertheless,\nfor our present proposes it suffices to put \u03c3ann v \u223c\nS(v )(\u03c3ann v)0 since the signal comes mainly from regions where v \u223c v \u2212 recall that v \u223c v at r = Racc =\n0.04 pc. In case 1, for instance, one is looking into a region of size \u223c 0.16 pc around the GC. The region defined\nin case 2 encompasses distances of \u223c 10 \u2212 20 pc from\nthe GC where v < v and S(v) \u2265 S(v ); hence, in this\ncase, considering \u03c3ann v \u223c S(v )(\u03c3ann v)0 yields actually\na lower bound on the radio flux.\nThe results for the radio flux (case 1 for Via Lactea\nII and case 2 for Aquarius) are presented in figure 7,\nplotted against the corresponding positron fluxes at 50\nGeV. In the case of Via Lactea II, we can see that most\ncandidates seem to be at odds with radio observations\neven when a rescaling of (\u03c3ann v)0 is applied to meet the\npositron excess. The situation for Aquarius (using case\n2) is similar.\n\n1500\n\u00f8\n\n\u039c\u039c\n\n1000\n\n\u03a4\u03a4\n\u00e0\n\n700\n\nae\n\nNT1\n\n500\n\nNT2\n\n\u00e7\n\nAH700\n\u00e1\n\n300\n200\n150\n\nMDM3\n\n \u0301\n\nMDM5\n\n\u00c4\n\n100\n\n10-11\n\n10-10\n\n10-9\n\n10-8\n\n10-7\n\n10-6\n\n10-5\n\npositron flux at 50 GeV @GeV-1cm-2s-1sr-1D\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTable IV summarizes our main results. There, we\npresent for each model under consideration the maximum (\u03c3ann v)0 allowed by the antiproton bound, the\nHESS measurement from the GC and radio observations.\nFor antiprotons we conservatively use the largest value in\nequation (12). The most constraining of the three limits,\ni.e. the one yielding a minimal (\u03c3ann v)0,max , is displayed\nin bold. We have disregarded here diffuse \u03b3-rays as well\nas radio fluxes in the cases 2 and 3 (1 and 3) for Via\nLactea II (Aquarius) since they give subdominant contraints. Furthermore, the e+ column shows the value of\n(\u03c3ann v)0 needed to meet the lowest positron flux in equation (11); these numbers are underlined only if allowed\nby the most stringent bound in bold. Notice that we\napply this procedure to MDM3 and MDM5 even though\nminimal dark matter is a rather predictive scheme.\nFirstly, we immediately see from table IV that radio\nobservations are rather constraining w.r.t. antiprotons or\n\u03b3-rays for models trying to explain the positron excess.\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) The radio flux for case 1 (2) and Via\nLactea II (Aquarius) parameters against the positron flux at\n50 GeV already presented in figure 4. The MED propagation\nis used and Mmin = 10\u22126 M . The horizontal line indicates\nthe measured flux (see [53] for details). Similarly to figure 4,\ncandidates lying above the diagonal line cannot be rescaled\nto explain PAMELA positron excess without violating radio\nbounds. Shaded regions are excluded by PAMELA (assuming\nthe electron fluxes discussed in the text) and radio observations.\n\nIn the case of Via Lactea II DM distribution, just one\ncandidate survives the studied bounds: AH700. There is\nstill some tension with the data though. In fact, in order\nto fit the PAMELA data, this model needs to be rescaled\ndown to (\u03c3ann v)0 of \u223c 10\u221227 cm3 s\u22121 , which means either that such particles would overclose the universe in\nthe standard thermal relic scenario, or that they are prevented to beLS4.55\nthe dominant dark matter component in the\nuniverse. As far as Aquarius is concerned, we identify no\nmodel that can evade all the implemented bounds.\n\n\f13\nAH700\nNT1\nNT2\n\n102\n\np\n\n101\n\n1\n\n102\n\nAH700\nNT1\nNT2\n\nVL2\n\ne+\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n\n1\n\n101\n\n102 102\n\nRadio H1L\n\n-2\n\n10\n\np\n\n101\n\n1\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n102\n\n102\n\n\u039c\u039c\n\u03a4\u03a4\n\nVL2\n\ne+\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n\n1\n\n101\n\n102 102\n\nRadio H1L\n\n10-2\n\np\n\n101\n\n1\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n101\n\n101\n\n1\n\n101\n\n102\n\nRadio H1L\n\n101\n102\n\n102\n\nMDM3\nMDM5\n\nVL2\n\ne+\n\n1\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n-2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n101\n\n102 102\n\nRadio H1L\n\np\n\n101\n\n1\n\n10-1 10-2\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n-2\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n101\n\n\u0393 GC\n\nAq.\n\ne+\n\n10\n\np\n\n1\n\n\u0393 GC\n102\n\n102\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n\n10-2\n\n\u0393 GC\n\nMDM3\nMDM5\n\nAq.\n\ne+\n\n10\n\n1\n\n102\n\n101\n\n1\n\n101\n\n101\n\nRadio H2L\n\n\u0393 GC\n102\n\np\n\n1\n\n10\n\n101\n\n102\n\n-1\n10-2 10\n-2\n\n\u0393 GC\n\n\u039c\u039c\n\u03a4\u03a4\n\nAq.\n\ne+\n\n1\n\n101\n\n102\n\nRadio H2L\n\n101\n\n\u0393 GC\n102\n\n102\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Multi-messenger bounds for several DM candidates.

The MED propagation is used and Mmin = 10\u22126 M . The bold values represent the most constraining channel and the\ne+ columns display the (\u03c3ann v)0 needed to meet the positron excess. Underlined values manage to explain the positron excess\nwhile being allowed by our multi-messenger scheme of constraints.\n\nIn figure 8 we introduce a new method to visualise the\nmulti-messenger constraints. We place each of the channels in a semi-axis and normalise it to the experimental\nlimits. Since we are interested in the viability of the DM\nexplanation of the positron excess, we only show models\nthat are able to reproduce the observed PAMELA flux,\nand thus cross the \"up\" axis at 1. Configurations exceeding the boxes on other axes violate observational bounds\nand are therefore ruled out. Configurations not crossing\nthe boxes are in principle viable, but one has to check\nthen whether the cross section allows to achieve the appropriate relic abundance, whether the \"boost-factors\"\nare reasonable, and whether the model provides a good\nfit to all PAMELA data. We stress that once the model\nis specified, the shape (angles and number of vertices) is\nfixed, and changing the cross-section corresponds to increasing or decreasing the overall size of the polygon.\nNote for instance that leptophilic configurations (first\nand second rows of figure 8) have a different shape with\nrespect to hadrophilic ones (third row).\n\nsubstructure and Sommerfeld enhancement \u2212 the candidates that provide a good fit to positron data, inevitably\noverproduce antiprotons, gamma-rays or radio emission.\nOur conclusions hold for the DM distributions from\nVia Lactea II and Aquarius simulations, the MED\npropagation model and Mmin = 10\u22126 M . As discussed\nin section V, modifying the propagation parameters\ndoes not change our main results. This is because the\nantiproton bound \u2212 the most sensitive to propagation\n\u2212 is subdominant. Thus, a different propagation model\nis not sufficient to reconcile the studied candidates with\nthe observational constraints. A non-standard DM\nprofile, and a non-standard magnetic field profile at\nthe Galactic Centre, can in principle make theoretical\nmodels compatible with observations, at the expenses of\nintroducing new ad-hoc hypotheses on these quantities.\nAcknowledgments\n\nTo sum up, we have analysed the possibility that the\nmodels in table II, recently suggested in the literature,\nmay explain the PAMELA positron excess without\nviolating bounds in the antiproton, \u03b3-ray and radio\nchannels.
