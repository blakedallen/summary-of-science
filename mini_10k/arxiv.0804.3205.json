DUNCAN, ILYA V. KAZACHKOV, AND VLADIMIR N. REMESLENNIKOV\n\n1. Introduction\nIn his important paper in [3] J. Stallings introduced a generalisation of amalgamated products of groups \u2013 called a pregroup, which is a particular kind of a\npartial group. He then defined the universal group U (P ) of a pregroup P to be a\nuniversal object (in the sense of category theory) extending the partial operations\non P to group operations on U (P ). The universal group turned out to be a versatile\nand convenient generalisation of classical group constructions: HNN-extensions and\namalgamated products. In this respect the following general question arises.Which\nproperties of pregroups, or relations between pregroups, carry over to the respective\nuniversal groups? The aim of this paper is to prove that universal equivalence of\npregroups extends to universal equivalence of their universal groups.\nWe begin by some preliminary model-theory results. We refer the reader to [2]\nfor a detailed introduction to model theory. The main goal here is to give a criterion\nof universal equivalence of two models in the form that best suits our needs.\n2. Preliminaries\nLet L be a language with signature (C, F, R), and variables X, where C is a\nset of constants and F and R are finite sets of functions and relations respectively.\nIn addition each element f of F is associated to a non-negative integer nf , and\nsimilarly for R.\nAn L-structure M is a 4-tuple:\n\u2022 a non-empty set M ;\n\u2022 a function fM : M nf \u2192 M for each f \u2208 F ;\n\u2022 a set rM \u2286 M nr for each r \u2208 R;\n\u2022 an element cM for each element c \u2208 C.\nIf a is an element of C, F or R we refer to aM as the interpretation of a in M.\nThe subscript M is omitted where no ambiguity arises.\nWe use the language L to write formulas describing the properties of Lstructures. Roughly speaking formulas are constructed inductively starting from\nconstant symbols from C and variable symbols v1 , . . . , vn , . . . , using the Boolean\nconnectives, relations from R, functions from F and the equality symbol '='.\nMore precisely, the set of L-terms is the smallest set T such that:\n\u2022 c \u2208 T for each constant symbol c \u2208 C;\n\u2022 each variable symbol vi \u2208 T ;\n\u2022 if t1 , . . . , tn \u2208 T and f \u2208 F then f (t1 , . . . , tnf ) \u2208 T .\nResearch supported by EPSRC grant EP/D065275.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. DUNCAN, I. KAZACHKOV, AND V. REMESLENNIKOV\n\nWe say that \u03a6 is an atomic L-formula if \u03a6 is either\n\u2022 t1 = t2 , where t1 and t2 are terms or,\n\u2022 r(t1 , . . . , tnr ), where r \u2208 R and t1 , . . . , tnr are terms.\nThe set of L-formulas is the smallest set W containing atomic formulas and such\nthat\n\u2022 if \u03a6 \u2208 W then \u00ac\u03a6 \u2208 W ;\n\u2022 if \u03a6 and \u03a8 are in W then \u03a6 \u2227 \u03a8 and \u03a6 \u2228 \u03a8 are in W and\n\u2022 if \u03a6 is in W then \u2203vi \u03a6 and \u2200vi \u03a6 are in W .\nIt is often useful in practice to observe that, as\n\u03a6 \u2228 \u03a8 \u2261 \u00ac(\u00ac\u03a6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03a8)\nand\n\u2200vi \u03a6 \u2261 \u00ac\u2203vi (\u00ac\u03a6)\nwe can construct all formulas (up to logical equivalence \u2261) without using \u2228 or \u2200.\nTo make induction arguments precise we shall define, for any term or formula s\nof L, the level l(s) and the constants C(s) of s. If s is a formula we shall also define\nthe degree d(s) of s. To begin with if t is a term and t = x or t = c, where x is a\nvariable and c a constant, then l(t) = 0 and\n\u001a\n\u2205, if t = x\nC(t) =\n.\nc, if t = c\nIf t = f (t1 , . . . , tn ), where n = nf and the ti are terms then l(t) =\nmax{l(t1 ), . . . , l(tn )} + 1, and C(t) = \u222ani=1 C(ti ).\nIf a is an atomic formula of the form t1 = t2 , for terms t1 and t2 , then we define\nl(a) = max{l(t1 ), l(t2 )} and C(t) = C(t1 ) \u222a C(t2 ). If r is an n-ary relation and\na = r(t1 , . . . , tn ) then set l(a) = max{l(t1 ), . . . , l(tn )} and C(a) = \u222ani=1 C(ti ). The\ndegree of an atomic formula a is defined to be d(a) = 0.\nIf \u03a6 = \u00ac\u03a8 or \u03a6 = \u2203x\u03a8 or \u2200x\u03a8 then we define l(\u03a6) = l(\u03a8), d(\u03a6) = d(\u03a8) + 1 and\nC(\u03a6) = C(\u03a8). If \u03a6 = \u03a61 \u2227 \u03a62 or \u03a61 \u2228 \u03a62 then we define l(\u03a6) = max{l(\u03a61 ), l(\u03a62 )},\nd(\u03a6) = d(\u03a61 ) + d(\u03a62 ) and C(\u03a6) = C(\u03a61 ) \u222a C(\u03a62 ).\nWe say that a variable v occurs freely in a formula \u03a6 if it is not inside a \u2203v or\na \u2200v quantifier, otherwise v is said to be bound. A formula is called a sentence or\nclosed if it has no free variables.\nLet \u03a6 be a formula with free variables from v = (v1 , . . . , vm ) and let \u0101 =\n(a1 , . . . , am ) \u2208 M m . We inductively define when \u03a6 holds on \u0101 in a L-structure\nM (\u03a6(\u0101) is true in M or M satisfies \u03a6(\u0101)), write M |= \u03a6(\u0101).\n\u2022 if \u03a6 is t1 = t2 , then M |= \u03a6(\u0101) if t1 (\u0101) = t2 (\u0101);\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = r(t1 , . . . , tnr ), then M |= \u03a6(\u0101) if r(t1 (\u0101), . . . , tnr (\u0101)) \u2208 rM ;\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = \u00ac\u03a8 then M |= \u03a6(\u0101) if M 2 \u03a8(\u0101);\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = \u03a81 \u2227 \u03a82 then M |= \u03a6(\u0101) if M |= \u03a81 (\u0101) and M |= \u03a82 (\u0101);\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = \u03a81 \u2228 \u03a82 then M |= \u03a6(\u0101) if M |= \u03a81 (\u0101) or M |= \u03a82 (\u0101);\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = \u2203vm+1 \u03a8(v\u0304, vm+1 ), then M |= \u03a6 if there exists b \u2208 M such that\nM |= \u03a8(\u0101, b);\n\u2022 if \u03a6 = \u2200vm+1 \u03a8(v\u0304, vm+1 ), then M |= \u03a6 if for all b \u2208 M one has M |=\n\u03a8(\u0101, b)\nA set of sentences is called a theory. We say that M is a model of a theory T if\nM |= \u03a6 for all \u03a6 \u2208 T . For an L-structure M we denote by Th(M) the collection of\n\n\fSTABILITY OF UNIVERSAL EQUIVALENCE OF GROUPS UNDER FREE CONSTRUCTIONS3\n\nall sentences that are satisfied by M, Th(M) is called the full or elementary theory\nof M.\nEvery formula \u03a6 of L with free variables v\u0304 = (v1 , . . . , vk ) is logically equivalent\nto a formula of the type\nQ1 x1 Q2 x2 . . . Qn xn \u03a8(x\u0304, v\u0304),\nwhere Qi \u2208 {\u2200, \u2203}, and \u03a8(x\u0304, v\u0304) is a boolean combination of atomic formulas in\nvariables from v\u0304 \u222a x\u0304. This form is called the prenex normal form of a formula \u03a6.\nA sentence \u03a6 is called universal (existential) if \u03a6 is equivalent to a formula of\nthe form\nQ1 x1 Q2 x2 . . . Qn xn \u03a8(x\u0304),\nwhere Qi = \u2200 (Qi = \u2203) for all i, and \u03a8(x\u0304) is a boolean combination of atomic\nformulas in the indicated variables. The collection of all universal (existential)\nsentences that are satisfied by an L-structure M is called the universal (existential)\ntheory of M, we denote it by Th\u2200 (M) (Th\u2203 (M)). If M and N are L-structures\nand Th\u2200 (M) = Th\u2200 (N ) we say that M and N are universally equivalent and write\nM \u2261\u2200 N . existential equivalence is defined similarly and we write M \u2261\u2203 N if M\nand N are existentially equivalent.\nLet A be a set of sentences of L and let M and N be models of A with underlying\nsets M and N respectively. For subsets S and T of M and N respectively we say\nthat a map \u03c6 : S \u2192 T is an L-morphism if the following conditions hold.\n(i) If c \u2208 C \u2229 S then c \u2208 T and \u03c6(c) = c.\n(ii) If f is an n-ary function (i.e. nf = n) in F and f (s1 , . . . , sn ) \u2208 S, for some\nn-tuple (s1 , . . . , sk ) of elements of S, then\n\u03c6(f (s1 , . . . , sn )) = f (\u03c6(s1 ), . . . , \u03c6(sn )) \u2208 T.\n(iii) If r is an n-ary relation in R and (s1 , . . . , sn ) \u2208 r, for some n-tuple\n(s1 , . . . , sn ) of elements of S, then (\u03c6(s1 ), . . . , \u03c6(sn )) \u2208 r.\nIf \u03c6 : S \u2192 T is a bijective L-morphism such that \u03c6\u22121 is an L-morphism from T to\nS then we say that \u03c6 is an L-isomorphism and that S and T are L-isomorphic or\nS\u223c\n=L T . L-isomorphism defines an equivalence relation on the subsets of a model\nM and we denote by [S] the equivalence class of S.\nNow we restrict attention to finite subsets of models. We denote by FL (M) =\nF (M) the set of L-isomorphism equivalence classes of finite subsets of M . We say\nthat models M and N have equivalent L-isomorphism classes of finite subsets, and\nwrite F (M) \u2261 F (N ), if there exists a bijection \u03b8 : F (M) \u2192 F (N ) such that,\nfor all finite subsets S \u2286 M , if \u03b8([S]) = [T ] then there exists an L-isomorphism\n\u03c6(S) \u2192 T \u2032 , for some T \u2032 \u2208 [T ] (hence for all T \u2032 \u2208 [T ]).\nLemma 2.1. F (M) \u2261 F (N ) if and only if, for all finite subsets S \u2286 M , there\nexists a subset T \u2286 N such that S \u223c\n=L T .\nProof. If F (M) \u2261 F (N ) and S is a finite subset of M then, by definition, S is\nL-isomorphic to some finite subset of N . Conversely, suppose every finite subset\nof M is L-isomorphic to a finite subset of N . For each isomorphism class U of\nfinite subsets of M choose a representative SU , so U = [SU ]. Similarly choose a\nrepresentative TV for each isomorphism class of finite subsets of N . Consider an\nisomorphism class U \u2208 F (M). SU is L-isomorphic to T for some finite subset of\nN . Let T \u2032 be the chosen representative of [T ]. Then SU \u223c\n=L T \u2032 . Define \u03b8(U ) = [T \u2032 ].\nThen \u03b8 is a well-defined map from F (M) to F (N ) and straightforward verification\n\n\f4\n\nA. DUNCAN, I. KAZACHKOV, AND V. REMESLENNIKOV\n\nshows that \u03b8 is a bijection. By construction, if \u03b8(U ) = V then SU is L-isomorphic\nto the representative T \u2032 of V , so the same goes of any element S \u2208 U . Hence\nF (M) \u2261 F (N ).\n\u0003\nIf M and N are models of A then it is easy to see that M \u2261\u2203 N if and only\nif M \u2261\u2200 N . The following proposition gives a further characterisation of this\nproperty, in certain cases.\nProposition 2.2.

By\ndefinition \u03c6 is an L-morphism and is a bijection of S and T . Moreover \u03c6\u22121 is, by\nconstruction of \u03a6, an L-morphism. Hence S \u223c\n=L T and it follows from Lemma 2.1\nthat F (M) \u2261 F (N ).\nNow suppose that F (M) \u2261 F (N ). Write Fn for the set of n-ary functions of\nF . Since F is finite we may assume that F is the union of Fn , for n from 1 to K,\nfor some K \u2208 N. Given a finite subset S of M we define the following sequence of\nsubsets. Set S0 = S and having defined Si set\n[\n[\n{f (m1 , . . . , mn )|mj \u2208 Si , j = 1, . . . , n}.\nSi+1 = Si \u222a\nn=1,...,K f \u2208Fn\n\nNow choose Tl \u2286 N such that there is an L-isomorphism \u03c6l from Sl to Tl , for all\nl \u2265 0.\nConsider a term t of level l with variables among x1 , . . . , xk and a k-tuple\na1 , . . . , ak of elements of M and set S = {a1 , . . . , ak } \u222a C(t). We claim that\nt(a1 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Sl . To see this note that it holds when l = 0, since in\nthis case t(a1 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 S. Suppose then that t has level l and that the\nclaim holds for at all levels below l. Then t = f (t1 , . . . , tm ), where l(ti ) <\nl. By assumption ti (a1 , . . . , tk ) \u2208 Sl\u22121 and so by definition t(a1 , . . . , ak ) =\nf (t1 (a1 , . . . , tk ), . . . , tm (a1 , . . . , tk )) \u2208 Sl ; and the claim holds for all l by induction.\nLet \u03a6 be a quantifier free formula with variables among x1 , . . . , xm and let \u03a8 =\n\u2203x1 , . . . , xm \u03a6. We wish to show that M \u000f \u03a8 if and only if N \u000f \u03a8. To do this\nwe shall proceed as follows. Suppose \u03a6 has level l and let a1 , . . . , am \u2208 M . Let\nS = S(\u03a6) = {a1 , . . . , am } \u222a C(\u03a6), where C(\u03a6) is the set of constants of \u03a6, and\ndefine S0 , S1 , . . . and \u03c61 , \u03c62 , . . . as above. We shall prove that\n(1)\n\nM \u000f \u03a6(a1 , . . . , am ) if and only if N \u000f \u03a6(\u03c6l (a1 ), . . . , \u03c6l (am )),\n\nand the result will follow immediately. We use induction on (d, l), where d is the\ndegree and l the level of \u03a6.\nAssume that (1) holds whenever \u03a6 has level at most l and degree 0. Suppose\nnow that \u03a6 has level l + 1 and degree 0. In this case \u03a6 is of the form t1 = t2 ,\nor of the form r(t1 , . . . , tm ), where r \u2208 R and the ti are terms. Since \u03a6 has\nlevel l + 1 at least one of the ti has level l + 1 and none have level greater than\nl + 1. Hence ti (a1 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Sl+1 , for all i. Set bi = \u03c6l+1 (ai ), i = 1, . . . , k.\nThen, as \u03c6l+1 is an isomorphism with domain Sl+1 , we have \u03c6l+1 (ti (a1 , . . . , ak )) =\nti (b1 , . . . , bk ), for all i. Furthermore t1 (a1 , . . . , ak ) = t2 (a1 , . . . , ak ) if and only\nif t1 (b1 , . . . , bk ) = t2 (b1 , . . . , bk ) and (t1 (a1 , . . . , ak ), . . . , tm (a1 , . . . , ak )) \u2208 r if and\nonly if (t1 (b1 , . . . , bk ), . . . , tm (b1 , . . . , bk )) \u2208 r. Hence M \u000f \u03a6(a1 , . . . ak ) if and only\nif N \u000f \u03a6(b1 , . . . , bk ). Therefore the result holds for \u03a6 of level l + 1 and degree 0.\n\n\f6\n\nA. DUNCAN, I. KAZACHKOV, AND V. REMESLENNIKOV\n\nNote that this argument also goes through in the case (d, l) = (0, 0) so by induction\n(1) holds for formulae \u03a6 of level l and degree 0, for all non-negative integers l.\nNow let d and l be non-negative integers and assume that (1) holds for formulae\n\u03a6 of degree d1 and level l1 where either (i) d1 \u2264 d and l1 = l or (ii) l1 < l.\nSuppose then that \u03a6 has level l and degree d + 1. Then either \u03a6 = \u00ac\u03a61 or\n\u03a6 = \u03a61 \u2227 \u03a62 , where \u03a61 and \u03a62 have degree at most d and level at most l. If\n\u03a6 = \u00ac\u03a61 then M \u000f \u03a61 (a1 , . . . , am ) if and only if N \u000f \u03a61 (a1 , . . . , am ), so the same\nholds with \u03a6 in place of \u03a61 . If \u03a6 = \u03a61 \u2227 \u03a62 then M \u000f \u03a6(a1 , . . . , am ) if and only if\nM \u000f \u03a6i (a1 , . . . , am ), for i = 1 and 2, if and only if N \u000f \u03a6i (a1 , . . . , am ), for i = 1\nand 2, if and only if N \u000f \u03a6(a1 , . . . , am ). It follows that (1) holds for \u03a6 of level l\nand any degree d + 1; hence by induction for all (d, l).\n\u0003\nWe call an expression of the form t1 = t2 , where t1 and t2 are terms, an equation.\nA set S of equations such that every element of S has variables among x1 , . . . , xm\nis called a system of equations in m variables. Let S be a system of equations in m\nvariables and let M be a model of L. We say that (a1 , . . . , am ) \u2208 M m is a solution\nof S in M if M \u000f s(a1 , . . . , am ), for all s \u2208 S. The variety defined by S over M\nis the set VM (S) = {(a1 , . . . , am ) \u2208 M m : (a1 , . . . , am ) is a solution of S}. We say\nthat a model M of L is equationally Noetherian if every system S of equations\ncontains a finite subset S0 such that VM (S0 ) = VM (S). As in [1] we have the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 2.3. Let M and N be L-structures. Then,\n(i) if M is equationally Noetherian and Th\u2203 (N ) \u2286 Th\u2203 (M), then N is equationally Noetherian;\n(ii) if M and N are universally equivalent, M is equationally Noetherian if\nand only if N is equationally Noetherian.\nProof. Suppose that M is equationally Noetherian and that S is a system of equations in m variables. Choose a subset S0 \u2286 S such that VM (S) = VM (S0 ). Let S0 =\n{s1 , . . . , sr } and for each s \u2208 S let \u03a6s be the sentence \u2200x1 , . . . , xm (s1 \u2227* * *\u2227sr \u2192 s).\nSince VM (S0 ) = VM (S) we have M \u000f \u03a6s and therefore, since under the assumptions of any of the two statements above Th\u2203 (N ) \u2286 Th\u2203 (M), we have N \u000f \u03a6s , for\nall s \u2208 S. As S0 \u2286 S it follows that VN (S) \u2286 VN (S0 ). If (b1 , . . . , bm ) \u2208 VN (S0 )\nthen, as N \u000f \u03a6s , we have (b1 , . . . , bm ) \u2208 VN (S), so VN (S0 ) = VN (S).\n\u0003\n3. Groups and Pregroups\nThe language of pregroups Lpre has signature (C, F, R) where C consists of a\nsingle element 1, F consists of a unary function symbol \u22121 and R consists of a\nbinary relation D and a ternary relation M . (The usual definition of a pregroup\ninvolves a product function defined on a subset D \u2282 P \u00d7 P . Our description of\nlanguage does not allow F to contain partially defined functions, so we use the\nrelation M instead of this product. We keep the relation D for compatibility with\nthe usual definition.) A pregroup is a model P of Lpre satisfying the following\naxioms.\n(i) \u2200x, y, z((x, y, z) \u2208 M \u2192 (x, y) \u2208 D).\n(ii) \u2200x, y((x, y) \u2208 D \u2192 \u2203z((x, y, z) \u2208 M )).\n(iii) \u2200w, x, y, z((w, x, y) \u2208 M \u2227 (w, x, z) \u2208 M \u2192 y = z).\n(iv) \u2200x((x, 1, x) \u2208 M \u2227 (1, x, x) \u2208 M ).\n\n\fSTABILITY OF UNIVERSAL EQUIVALENCE OF GROUPS UNDER FREE CONSTRUCTIONS7\n\n\u2200x((x, x\u22121 , 1) \u2208 M \u2227 (x\u22121 , x, 1) \u2208 M ).\n\u2200x, y, z((x, y, z) \u2208 M \u2192 (y \u22121 , x\u22121 , z \u22121 ) \u2208 M ).\n\u2200a, b, c, r, s, x((a, b, r) \u2208 M \u2227 (b, c, s) \u2208 M \u2192 ((a, s, x) \u2208 M \u2194 (r, c, x) \u2208 M )).\n\u2200a, b, c, d, x, y, z((a, b, x) \u2208 M \u2227 (b, c, y) \u2208 M \u2227 (c, d, z) \u2208 M \u2192 \u2203r, s((a, y, r) \u2208\nM \u2228 (y, d, s) \u2208 M )).\nA pregroup homomorphism is a morphism of Lpre -structures and a subpregroup is\nan Lpre -substructure of an Lpre -structure. Thus K is a subpregroup of P if and\nonly if K is a pregroup, K \u2286 P , 1K = 1P , DK = DP \u2229 (K \u00d7 K) and MK =\nMP \u2229 (K \u00d7 K \u00d7 K) (from which it follows that the operation of inversion in P\nextends that in K).\nWe wish, as in [1] for the group case, to consider pregroups which contain designated copies of some fixed pregroups (or some of their subsets). To this end we\nmake the following definition.\n\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii)\n(viii)\n\nDefinition 3.1. Let M be an L-structure and N a subset of M . The diagram of\nN is the set of all closed atomic formulas, and their negations, which hold in N .\nNow let S \u2032 be a fixed multiset of pregroups and, for each L \u2208 S \u2032 , let KL be a\nsubset of L containing 1L . Let S be the set {KL |L \u2208 S \u2032 }. We define the language of\npre\nS-pregroups Lpre\nwith signature identical to Lpre except\nS to be the extension of L\nK\nthat C = \u222aK\u2208S {dk |k \u2208 K} and R contains a unary relation \u03b4S . A K-pregroup\nis a model P of Lpre\nsatisfying the axioms for a pregroup all the formulas of the\nS\ndiagram of K, for all K \u2208 S, and the additional axioms\n(ix) dK\nk \u2208 \u03b4S , for all k \u2208 K, for all K \u2208 S, and\n(x) \u2200x(x \u2208\n/ \u03b4S \u2192 x 6= dk ), for all k \u2208 K, for all K \u2208 S.\n(There is one axiom of type (ix) and one of type (x) for each k \u2208 K and K \u2208 S.) A\nS-pregroup homomorphism is a morphism of Lpre\nS -structures and a S-subpregroup\npre\nis an Lpre\n-substructure\nof\nan\nL\n-structure.\nA\nS-pregroup is finitely generated if\nS\nS\nit is finitely generated as a model of Lpre\n.\nIf\nS\nconsists of a single element K we\nS\npre\ncall an S-pregroup a K-pregroup and write Lpre\nK instead of LS .\nLemma 3.2. Let P be a pregroup and a, b, c \u2208 P . If (a, b, c) \u2208 M then (c, b\u22121 , a)\nand (c\u22121 , a, b\u22121 ) \u2208 M .\nProof. We have (a, b, c) and (b, b\u22121 , 1) \u2208 M and, as also (a, 1, a) \u2208 M , axiom (vii)\nimplies (c, b\u22121 , a) \u2208 M . Repeating this argument starting with (c\u22121 , c, 1), (c, b\u22121 , a)\nand (1, b\u22121 , b) we see that (c\u22121 , a, b\u22121 ) \u2208 M .\n\u0003\nLet S \u2032 be a fixed multiset of groups and, for each G \u2208 S \u2032 , let KG be a subset of G\ncontaining 1G . Let S be the set {KG |G \u2208 S \u2032 }. The language of S-groups is defined\nto be the language LS with signature (C, F, R), where C = \u222aK\u2208S {dK\nk |k \u2208 K},\nF consists of a binary function symbol * and a unary function symbol \u22121 and R\nconsists of a unary relation symbol \u03b4S . Then an S-group H is a model of LS\nsatisfying the usual group axioms with respect to * as multiplication and \u22121 as\ninverse in H, as well as all the formulas of the diagram of K, for all K \u2208 S, and\nthe additional axioms\n(a) dK\nk \u2208 \u03b4S , for all k \u2208 K, K \u2208 S, and\n(b) \u2200x(x \u2208\n/ \u03b4\u03a3 =\u21d2 x 6= dK\nk ), for all k \u2208 K, K \u2208 S.\nThe class of all S-groups together with the naturally defined S-morphisms forms a\ncategory.\n\n\f8\n\nA. DUNCAN, I. KAZACHKOV, AND V. REMESLENNIKOV\n\nIf S consists of a single element K then we refer to K-groups instead of S-groups\nand write LK instead of LS . In this case, if K = G we recover the definition of\nG-group in [1]. Further, if G = K = 1 then we drop the predicate \u03b4S from the\nlanguage and we have the standard language L of groups. Note that, if G is a\ngroup, a G-group H is equationally Noetherian in the sense defined in the previous\nsection if and only if it is G-equationally Noetherian in the sense of [1].\nNotions of universal equivalence, elementary equivalence and equivalence of finite\nsubsets for S-groups are defined with respect to the language LS ; as are substructures and extensions of S-groups. A S-group H is locally S-discriminated by a Sgroup N if, given a finite subset F = {h1 , . . . , hk } of H there is a S-homomorphism\n(i.e. LS -morphism) from H to N which is injective on F . A S-group H is said\nto be finitely generated if there exists a finite subset F of H such that H is generated by F \u222a \u222aK\u2208S K. (Thus a finitely generated S-group is a finitely generated\nLS -model.) If P is any property then a S-group H is said to be locally P if every non-trivial finitely generated S-subgroup of H has property P . The following\ntheorem is proved in [1].\nTheorem 3.3 ([1]). Let G be a group and H and K be G-groups one of which\nis G-equationally Noetherian. Then H is locally G-discriminated by K and K is\nlocally G-discriminated by G if and only if K and H are universally equivalent (with\nrespect to LG ).\nIf a, b are elements of pregroup P and (a, b) \u2208 DP we write ab for the unique\nelement c such that (a, b, c) \u2208 M . Following Stallings [3] we define a word of\nlength k over a pregroup P to be a finite sequence (c1 , . . . , ck ) of elements of P .\nIf (ci , ci+1 ) \u2208 D then ci ci+1 \u2208 P and the word (c1 , . . . , ci\u22121 , ci ci+1 , ci+1 , . . . , ck ) is\nsaid to be a reduction of (c1 , . . . , ck ). The word (c1 , . . . , ck ) is said to be reduced if\n(ci , ci+1 ) \u2208\n/ D, for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1.\nLet c = (c1 , . . . , ck ) and a = (a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) be words such that (c1 , a1 ) \u2208 D,\n\u22121\n(a\u22121\ni\u22121 , ci ) and (ai\u22121 ci , ai ) are in D, for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, and (ak\u22121 , ck ) \u2208 D. Then\nthe interleaving c \u2217 a of c and a is the word (d1 , . . . , dk ) given by d1 = c1 a1 ,\ndi = a\u22121\ni\u22121 ci ai , for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, and dk = ak\u22121 ck . We define a relation \u2248 on the\nset of words by c \u2248 d if and only if d = c \u2217 a, for some word a. As shown in [3] if\nc is reduced then so is c \u2217 a and the relation \u2248 is an equivalence relation on the set\nof reduced words over P . The universal group U (P ) of the pregroup P is the set of\nequivalence classes of reduced words: the group operation being concatenation of\nwords followed by reduction to a reduced word. As P embeds in U (P ) then, if P is\na K-pregroup it follows that U (P ) is a K-group. A group G may be regarded as a\npregroup: with D = G \u00d7 G and M the multiplication table of G. It is shown in [3]\nthat U (P ) is universal in the sense that, given a group H and a pregroup morphism\n\u03b8 from P to H, there is a unique extension of \u03b8 to a group homomorphism from\nU (P ) to H.\nLemma 3.4. Let P be a pregroup and let (c1 , . . . , cm ) and (d1 , . . . , dn ) be words.\nThen (c1 , . . . , cm ) \u2248 (d1 , . . . , dn ) if and only if m = n and\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n(d\u22121\nr\u22121 * * * d1 c1 * * * cr\u22121 , cr ) \u2208 DP and (dr , dr\u22121 * * * d1 c1 * * * cr ) \u2208 DP ,\n\u22121\nr = 1, . . . m, and d\u22121\nm * * * d1 c1 * * * cm = 1.\n\nProof. Write D = DP . Suppose first that (c1 , . . . , cm ) \u2248 (d1 , . . . , dn ).

If Q is a subpregroup of a pregroup P then U (Q) is a subgroup of\nU (P ). In particular, if P is an S-pregroupthen U (P ) is an S-group.\nProof. To prove the first statement we need to show that if a and b are words over\nQ then a \u2248 b in Q if and only if a \u2248 b in P . Suppose that a \u2248 b in P . Then\nusing Lemma 3.4 and the definition of Lpre -substructure we have a \u2248 b in Q. As\nthe opposite implication is immediate this proves the first part of the corollary. For\nthe second statement suppose that K \u2208 S and that K is a subset of a pregroup\nL, as in the definition above. As K \u2286 P we may assume that L \u2286 P and so\nK \u2286 U (L) \u2286 U (P ).\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.6. Let P1 and P2 be S-pregroups. If P1 \u2261\u2203 P2 with respect to Lpre\nS\nthen U (P1 ) \u2261\u2203 U (P2 ) with respect to LS .\nProof. Let Ui = U (Pi ) and Di = DPi , for i = 1, 2. We shall show that F (U1 ) \u2261\nF (U2 ) and the theorem will then follow from Proposition 2.2.\nLet F = {\u01691 , . . . , \u0169m } be a finite subset of U1 . For each i choose a representative\nui of \u0169i and write it as a reduced word ui = (ci1 , . . . , cimi ) over P1 . Let S0 =\nmi\n\u222am\ni=1 \u222aj=1 {cij } and for all r \u2265 0 let Sr+1 = Sr \u222a {ab : a, b \u2208 Si and (a, b) \u2208 D1 }.\nLet J = max{mi : i = 1, . . . , m} and define S = S2J . As P1 \u2261\u2203 P2 there is, using\nProposition 2.2, an Lpre\nS -isomorphism \u03c6 from S to a subset T of P2 . Note that\nsetting T0 = \u03c6(S0 ) we may define Tr as we have defined Sr , with T0 in place of S0\nand P2 in place of P1 . Then, by definition of isomorphism and by construction of\nS it follows that \u03c6(Sr ) = Tr , for r = 0, . . . , 2J, so T = T2J . Let c = (c1 , . . . , ck )\nbe a word over S (i.e. ci \u2208 S, for all i) and let \u03c6(ci ) = di . Then d = (d1 , . . . , dk )\nis a word over T and we define a map \u03b8 from words over S to words over T by\nsetting \u03b8(c) = d. In this case, for all such c, we have (ci , ci+1 ) \u2208 D1 if and only if\n(di , di+1 ) \u2208 D2 , so \u03b8 maps reduced words to reduced words.\n\n\f10\n\nA. DUNCAN, I. KAZACHKOV, AND V. REMESLENNIKOV\n\nNow let p1 = (p11 , . . . , p1m1 ) and p2 = (p21 , . . . , p2m2 ) be words over S0 ,\nwith mi \u2264 J. Let \u03c6(pij ) = qij , and let \u03b8(pi ) = qi = (qi1 , . . . , qimi ), i =\n1, 2. From Lemma 3.4 we have p1 \u2248 p2 if and only if m1 = m2 = k,\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\n(p\u22121\n2,r\u22121 * * * p2,1 p1,1 * * * p1,r\u22121 , p1,r ) and (p2,r , p2,r\u22121 * * * p2,1 p1,1 * * * p1,r\u22121 p1,r ) belong\n\u22121\n\u22121\nto D1 , for r = 1, . . . , k, and p2,k * * * p2,1 p1,1 * * * p1,k = 1. Since all the elements\nof P1 involved in these conditions belong to S, the conditions hold if and only if\nthey hold on replacing pij with qij . Hence p1 \u2248 p2 if and only if q1 \u2248 q2 . Therefore\n\u03b8 induces a map \u03b8\u0303 from equivalence classes of reduced words over S0 , of length at\nmost J, to equivalence classes of reduced words over T0 .\nLet S\u0303 and T\u0303 denote the sets of equivalence classes of reduced words of length\nat most J, over S0 and T0 respectively. To see that the map that \u03b8\u0303 is an LS morphism from S\u0303 to T\u0303 consider a word (not necessarily reduced) p = (p1 , . . . , pk )\nover S0 of length k \u2264 J. Let qi = \u03c6(pi ) and let \u03b8(p) = q = (q1 , . . . , qk ). We\nclaim that for r with 0 \u2264 r \u2264 k \u2212 1 there is a sequence of r reductions which we\nmay apply to p, resulting in a word pr , if and only if there is a corresponding\nsequence of r reductions which we may apply to q resulting in a word qr such\nthat \u03b8(pr ) = qr . Moreover pr \u2208 Sr and qr \u2208 Tr . This holds trivially for r = 0.\nSuppose that it holds for 0, . . . , r, for some 0 \u2264 r \u2264 k \u2212 2. Let pr = (pr,1 , . . . , pr,s )\nand qr = ((qr,1 , . . . , qr,s ), with pr \u2208 Sr and qr \u2208 Tr and qr = \u03b8(pr ). We may\napply a reduction to pr if and only if (pr,i , pr,i+1 ) \u2208 D1 , for some i, in which\ncase we may define pr+1 = (pr,1 , . . . , pr,i pr,i+1 , . . . pr,s ) and then pr+1 \u2208 Sr+1 .\nSince \u03c6 is an Lpre\nS -isomorphism this occurs if and only if (qr,i , qr,i+1 ) \u2208 D2 , in\nwhich case we may define qr+1 = (qr,1 , . . . , qr,i qr,i+1 , . . . qr,s ) and then qr+1 \u2208 Tr+1 .\nSince \u03b8(pr ) = qr it follows that \u03b8(pr+1 ) = qr+1 and so the claim holds for all\nr. Now let p\u03031 and p\u03032 be elements of S\u0303 and let p1 and p2 be reduced words, of\nlength at most J, over S0 representing p\u03031 and p\u03032 , respectively. Suppose that p\nis a reduced word (over S) obtained from the concatenation p1 p2 by a sequence\nof reductions. Then, in U1 , we have p\u03031 p\u03032 = p\u0303, where p\u0303 is the equivalence class of\np. Let qi = \u03b8(pi ) and q = \u03b8(p). Then, from the above, the concatenation q1 q2\nreduces to q, which is a reduced word over T . Hence, in U2 , q\u03031 q\u03032 = q\u0303, where q\u0303 is\nthe equivalence class of q. Now, in the case where p is a word over S0 we have\n\u03b8\u0303(p\u03031 )\u03b8\u0303(p\u03032 ) = q\u03031 q\u03032 = q\u0303 = \u03b8\u0303(p\u0303) = \u03b8\u0303(p\u03031 p\u03032 ), showing that \u03b8\u0303 is an LS -morphism. Using\nthe result of the first half of this paragraph and the fact that \u03b8\u0303 is bijective we can\nshow that \u03b8\u0303\u22121 is also an LS -morphism. In particular \u03b8\u0303 restricted to F is an LS\nisomorphism onto its image. Therefore F (U1 ) = F (U2 ), as required.\n\u0003\n4. Applications\nIn this section we apply Theorem 3.6 to prove that the universal equivalence of\npregroups translates nicely into universal equivalence of free constructions.\n4.1. Free products.

In this case\nlet P = A \u222a B and set D = (A \u00d7 A) \u222a (B \u00d7 B). Then P is a pregroup and\nU (P ) = A \u2217 B.\nProposition 4.1.

Again it simplifies notation to assume\nthat A and B are C-groups which intersect in the designated copy of the subgroup\nC, where C 6= 1. In this case let P = A \u222a B and set D = (A \u00d7 A) \u222a (B \u00d7 B). Then\nP is a C-pregroup and U (P ) = A \u2217C B.\nProposition 4.2. Let A1 , B1 , A2 and B2 be C-groups such that A1 \u2229B1 = A2 \u2229B2 =\nC. If FLC (A1 ) \u2261 FLC (A2 ) and FLC (B1 ) \u2261 FLC (B2 ) then the group A1 \u2217C1 B1 is\nexistentially equivalent to A2 \u2217C2 B2 in the language LC and, a fortiori, in the\nlanguage L.\nProof. Let P1 = A1 \u222a B1 and P2 = A2 \u222a B2 , be two C-pregroups as above. Let S be\na finite subset of P1 in the language Lpre\nC .
