We draw comparison between the Sobolev inequality that defines\n\u2217\nthe continuous imbedding D 1,p (RN ) \u0592\u2192 Lp , p\u2217 = NpN\n, when N > p, and the\n\u2212p\nTrudinger-Moser inequality (see Yudovich [22], Peetre [14], Pohozhaev [15],\nTrudinger [21] and Moser [13]):\n\nsup\nB\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u03a9\n\ne\u03b1N |u|\n\nN\u2032\n\ndx < \u221e,\n\nB = {u \u2208 W01,N (\u03a9) : k\u2207ukN \u2264 1},\n\n(1.1)\n\n1/(N \u22121)\n\nis the\nwhere \u03a9 \u2282 RN is a bounded domain, N \u2032 = NN\u22121 , \u03b1N = N\u03c9N \u22121\noptimal constant (due to Moser [13]), and \u03c9N \u22121 is the area of the unit N \u2212 1dimensional sphere. Using the notation kukq for the Lq -norm of u, we fix\nthe norm of W01,N as k\u2207ukN . A ball in RN of radius R centered at y will be\ndenoted BR (y), abbreviated to BR when y = 0, and to B if y = 0 and R = 1.\nWe will refer to the functional\n\u02c6 \u0010\n\u0011\nN\u2032\ndef\n(1.2)\nJ(u) =\ne\u03b1N |u| \u2212 1 dx\n\u03a9\n\nas Moser functional. Analogs of Trudinger-Moser inequality has been\nestablished for more general Sobolev spaces by Adams ([1], the case of higher\nderivatives), and by Fusco, Lions and Sbordone ([8], a weighted version of the\nTrudinger-Moser inequality which allows nonlinearities of very high growth).\n\u2032\n\u2217\nImbeddings D 1,p (RN ) \u0592\u2192 Lp , p < N, and W01,N (B) \u0592\u2192 exp LN , defined,\nrespectively, by Sobolev and Trudinger-Moser inequalities, are optimal when\nthe target space in the class of Orlicz spaces. Further refinement of these\nimbeddings is possible, however, in the larger class of rearrangement-invariant\nspaces, where the correspondent Orlicz spaces can be identified on the\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u2217\nscales of Lorentz, resp. Lorentz-Zygmund, spaces as Lp = Lp ,p , resp.\n\u2032\nexp LN = L\u221e,\u221e;\u22121/N . For further details we refer the reader to Appendix A.\n \u0301\n\u2217\nIt is well known that the critical Sobolev nonlinearity RN |u|p dx. lacks\nweak continuity in D 1,p (RN ) at any point u (consider any sequence of the\nN\u2212p\nform uk (x) = u(x) + k p w(kx), w 6= 0, k \u2192 \u221e, and apply Brezis-Lieb\n2\n\n\flemma). In contrast to that, according to the result of Lions, Theorem I.6 in\n([12], Moser functional on B is weakly continuous at any point except zero,\nand it is also weakly continuous on every sequence in B that converges weakly\nto zero, unless k\u2207uk kN \u2192 1 and uk has exactly one point of concentration.\nIn restriction to radially symmetric functions, the result of Lions can be\nfurther refined by using calculations from the paper [13] of Moser, which\nallow to infer that Moser functional on B lacks weak continuity only (up\nto a remainder vanishing in W01,N ) on a sequence of Moser functions (1.3),\nconcentrating at the origin. We reproduce these calculations in Appendix B.\nThis indicates that, even without the assumption of radial symmetry,\nthe class of sequences on which the Moser functional fails to be weakly\ncontinuous, may be characterized not just by the mere property of\nconcentration at one point, but by a specific asymptotic behavior. The main\nresult of this paper, proved here for the case N = p = 2, is that this class\nconsists of the same sequences as in the radial case, but subjected to arbitrary\ntranslations. This is consistent with the observation made here that the\nconcentrating sequences that do not vanish in the exp L2 -norm are always\nasymptotically radial, in contrast with the case N > 2. By a concentrating\nsequence we mean here a sequence bounded in the corresponding Sobolev\nspace, convergent almost everywhere to zero, but which do not vanish in the\n\u2217\n\u2032\nLp -norm for N > p, resp. in exp LN -norm for N = p. In the case N > p,\nany (generally nonradial) function w can occur as a concentration profile,\nN\u22122\nsince the sequence uk (x) = k 2 w(kx) will be a concentrating sequence,\nN\u22122\nwhose normalized deflations by the scale factor k \u22121 , that is, k \u2212 2 uk (k \u22121 x),\nequal w. In the case N = p = 2, the analogous sequence uk (x) = w(kx),\nvanishes in exp L2 , i. e. it is not concentrating. The relevant counterpart of\nthe rescaling deflations, presented in this paper for N = 2, forms sequences\nwith discrete rotational symmetries whose rank goes to infinity, forming in\nthe limit radial concentration profiles.\nIn order to define concentration that describes, for sequences bounded\nin the H01 -norm, the defect of convergence in the exp L2 -norm, we prove\na suitable profile decomposition, similar to the decomposition in [4] for\nthe radial case. Our starting point (we do not survey here a vast earlier\nliterature where profile decompositions are established under substantial\nadditional assumptions, typically, for critical sequences for elliptic variational\nproblems, mentioning only the pioneering work of Struwe [18]) is the\nprofile decomposition due to Solimini [16] (a similar decomposition was\n3\n\n\findependently proved by Gerard [9] and extended to more general spaces\nby Jaffard [10], as well as by one of the authors of this paper) expresses a\nsubsequence of an arbitrary bounded sequence in the Sobolev space D 1,p (RN ),\nN\u2212p\n\nN > p, as an asymptotic sum whose terms have the form tk p w(tk x), with a\n\u2217\nremainder vanishing in Lp . In the paper [19] (elaborated in [20]) existence\nof profile decomposition was proved, for the general Hilbert space equipped\nwith a group (subject to some general conditions) of unitary operators. This\nin turn gave rise to the notion of cocompact imbedding of Banach spaces\nX \u0592\u2192 Y , which is, roughly speaking, amounts to the vanishing in the norm\nof Y of the remainder of the profile decomposition in X. The functionalanalytic profile decomposition prompted us to define operators that could\nplay the role of Solimini's \"rescalings\", with the remainder in the profile\n\u2032\ndecomposition vanishing in exp LN . In [4], dealing with the subspace of\nradial functions of W01,N (B), pertinent rescalings are given by (3.17). In\nthis paper we have adopted an extension of the unitary operators (3.17) for\nthe case N = 2 to isomertires (2.15) on the whole space W01,N (B). These\nisometries are no longer bijective. Furthermore, they are defined only for\nthe integer value of the parameter, and, while the operators (3.17) form a\ngroup, the set of operators (2.15) is only a semigroup. On the other hand, it\nis exactly the absence of bijectivity (in fact, of surjectivity, since isometries\nare always injective) that is ultimately responsible for the radial profiles of\nconcentration profiles.\nThe results of the paper are as follows. In order to establish the\nstructure of the exceptional sequences for Moser functional, we employ a\nstraightforward adaptation, Theorem 2.2, of the functional-analytic profile\ndecomposition theorem from [20]. Theorem 2.5 is an application of\nTheorem 2.2 to the Sobolev space H01 (B) equipped with the semigroup (2.15).\nIn Theorem 2.6 we verify that the remainder of the profile decomposition\nvanishes in the exp L2 -norm (which is an equivalent quasinorm of L\u221e,\u221e;\u22121/2 ,\nor in other words, that the imbedding H01 (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,\u221e;\u22121/2 is cocompact.\nCombining this and the optimal imbedding H01 (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,2;\u22121 , one gets by the\nH\u00f6lder inequality that the imbedding H01 (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,q;\u22121/q\u22121/2 is cocompact\nfor any q > 2. By analogy with Solimini's counterexample on p.333 of [16], we\nalso show that the optimal imbedding H01 (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,2;\u22121 is not cocompact.\nThe main result of the paper is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u03a9 \u2282 R2 be a bounded domain, and let J be the Moser\nfunctional (1.2). If uk \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) is such that k\u2207uk k2 \u2264 1, uk \u21c0 u, and\n4\n\n\flim inf J(uk ) > J(u), then there is a sequence \u03b6k \u2208 \u03a9\u0304 and a sequence\nsk \u2208 (0, 1) such that uk \u2212 msk (* \u2212 \u03b6k ) \u2192 0 in the H 1 -norm, where\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\nlog(1/r)\ndef\n\u2212N\n\u2032\nms (r) = (\u03c9N \u22121 ) log(1/s) N min\n, 1 , r, s \u2208 (0, 1). (1.3)\nlog(1/s)\nThe functions (1.3) were used by Moser in [13] to prove optimality of the\nconstant in (1.1), and are usually called Moser functions.\nProfile decompositions, Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.5 are proved in\nSection 2.

The proof is an elementary modification of the proof of Theorem 3.1\nfrom [20] and we give it in an abbreviated form.\n1. One shows first that (2.4) follows from (2.2) and (2.3). The proof of\nthis step is analogous to that in [20] and can be omitted.\nD\n2. Observe that if uk \u21c0 0, the theorem is verified with N0 = \u2205. If not so,\nconsider the expressions of the form\n(1)\n\nw (1) =: w-lim gk uk .\n\n(2.6)\n\nSince we assume that uk does not converge D-weakly to zero, there exists\n(1)\nnecessarily a renumbered sequence gk that yields a non-zero limit in (2.6).\nLet\n(1)\n(1) \u2217\nvk = uk \u2212 gk w (1) ,\nand observe, by (2.6), that\n(1) (1)\n\n(1)\n\ngk vk = gk uk \u2212 w (1) \u21c0 0.\n(1) D\n\n(2.7)\n\nIf vk \u21c0 0, the theorem is verified with N0 = {1}. If not \u2013 we repeat the\n(2)\nargument above \u2013 there exist, necessarily, a sequence gk \u2208 D and a w (2) 6= 0\nsuch that, on a renumbered subsequence,\n(2) (1)\n\ngk vk \u21c0 w (2) .\n6\n\n\fLet us set\n\n(2)\n\n(2) \u2217\n\n(1)\n\nvk = vk \u2212 gk\n\nw (2) .\n\nThen we will have an obvious analog of (2.7):\n(2) (2)\n\n(2) (1)\n\ngk vk = gk vk \u2212 w (2) \u21c0 0.\nIf we assume that\n\n(1) (2) \u2217\n\ngk gk\nthen by (2.1), (2.8),\n(1)\n\n6\u21c0 0,\n\n(1)\n\n(2) \u2217\n\n(1) (2) \u2217\n\nw (2) \u21c0 0.\n\ngk (vk \u2212 gk\n\n(2.8)\n\nw (2) ) \u21c0 0,\n\nwhich, due to (2.7), yields\ngk gk\n\n(2.9)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nWe now use (2.1) again to replace in (2.9) gk with gk , which results in\nw (2) \u21c0 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhich cannot be true since we assumed w (2) 6= 0. This contradiction implies\nthat\n(1) (2) \u2217\ngk gk \u21c0 0.\nSince for bounded sequences of operators Ak \u21c0 0 implies A\u2217k \u21c0 0, we also\nhave\n(2) (1) \u2217\ngk gk \u21c0 0.\nRecursively we define:\n(n)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nvk := vk\n\n(n) \u2217\n\n\u2212 gk\n\n(1) \u2217\n\nw (n) = uk \u2212 gk\n\nwhere\n\n(n) \u2217\n\nw (1) \u2212 * * * \u2212 gk\n\n(n) (n\u22121)\n\nw (n) = w-lim gk vk\n\nw (n) ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n,\n\ncalculated on a successively renumbered subsequence. We subordinate the\n(n)\nchoice of gk and thus extraction of this subsequence for every given n to\nthe following requirements. For every n \u2208 N we set\n(n)\n\nWn = {w \u2208 H1 \\ {0} : \u2203gj \u2208 D, {kj } \u2282 N : gj vkj \u21c0 w},\n\n7\n\n\fand\ntn = sup kwk.\nw\u2208Wn\n\nIf for some n, tn = 0, the theorem is proved. Otherwise, like in [20] we choose\na w (n+1) \u2208 Wn such that\n1\nkw (n+1) k \u2265 tn\n(2.12)\n2\n(n+1)\n\nand the sequence gk\n\nis chosen so that on a subsequence that we renumber,\n(n+1) (n)\nvk\n\ngk\n\n\u21c0 w (n+1) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nAn argument analogous to the one brought above for n = 1, 2 shows that\n(p) (q) \u2217\n\ngk gk\n\n\u21c0 0 whenever p 6= q, p, q \u2264 n.\n\n(2.14)\n\nThis allows to deduce immediately (2.2) from (2.13).\n3. Similarly to [20] one derives that tn \u2192 0 from which subsequently\nfollows the asymptotics (2.5). The convergence of the series (2.5), like in [20],\nis a modification of Plancherel formula that requires to extract a sufficiently\nrarefied subsequence of uk to assure sufficient approximation of orthogonality\n(n) \u2217\nby the asymptotically orthogonal terms gk w (n) .\nFrom now on we assume, without loss of generality that \u03a9 \u2282 B 1 . This\n2\nrestriction is not substantial and can be removed by linear rescaling, since,\nif we denote the Moser function subordinated to an annulus t < r < R as\n(R)\nmt , an easy computation shows that, for any R > 0,\n(R)\n\nlim k\u2207(mt\nt\u21920\n\n\u2212 mt )k2 \u2192 0.\n\nLet us now specify H1 , H0 and D as follows: H1 = H01 (B), H0 = H01 (\u03a9),\nand\n1\n\nD = {gj,\u03b6 u(z) = j \u2212 2 u(\u03b6 + z j ), \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9\u0304, j \u2208 N}.\n\n(2.15)\n\nHere and in what follows, the expression z j stays for the power of the complex\nnumber representing a point in z \u2208 R2 , and translations of functions H01 (\u03a9)\nare understood, using extension by zero, as elements of H01 (B).\nWe have the following obvious property of the asymptotic profiles (2.2).\n\n8\n\n\fRemark 2.3. If the sequences uk \u2208 H01 (\u03a9), jk \u2208 N, and \u03b6k \u2208 \u03a9 are such\nthat gjk ,\u03b6k uk \u21c0 w, jk \u2192 \u221e and zk \u2192 z0 , then w is radially symmetric.\nThere is also an obvious analytic form of (2.3).\nLemma 2.4. Let D be the set of operators as above. Two sequences,\n(1)\n(2)\n{gj (1) ,z (1) }k \u2282 D and {gj (2) ,z (2) }k \u2282 D, with jk \u2192 \u221e and jk \u2192 \u221e, satisfy\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\ngj (2) ,z (2) gj\u2217(1) ,z (1) \u21c0 0\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nif and only if\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\ninf |zk \u2212 zk | > 0 or | log jk \u2212 log jk | \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(2.16)\n\nk\n\nThis allows to express Theorem 2.2 for our particular choice of H1 , H0\nand D as follows.\nTheorem 2.5.

Let \u03a9 \u2282 B 1 , and let D be the set (2.15). If a sequence\n2\n2\nuk \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) is D-weakly convergent\nto\n\u0011 zero, then uk \u2192 0 in exp L . In\n \u0301 \u0010 \u03bbu2\nparticular, for any \u03bb > 0, \u03a9 e k \u2212 1 dx \u2192 0.\nNote that the restriction \u03a9 \u2282 B 1 is not substantial and this statement\n2\ncan be restated for any bounded domain by linear rescaling.\nBefore we prove the theorem, we state a corollary and a counterexample.\n\nCorollary 2.7. Let \u03a9 \u2282 B 1 . If a sequence uk \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) is D-weakly\n2\nconvergent to zero, then, for every q \u2208 (2, \u221e], it converges to zero in the\nLorentz-Zygmund space L\u221e,q;\u22121/q\u22121/2 .\nThis easily follows from the embedding H01 (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,2;\u22121 and the\ninterpolation by H\u00f6lder inequality between L\u221e,2;\u22121 and L\u221e,\u221e;\u22121/2 = exp L2 .\nRemark 2.8. By analogy with the counterexample given by Solimini [16] that\nremainder in his profile decomposition does not necessarily converge in the\n\u2217\nsense of Lp ,p , we can show that Corollary 2.7 does not extend to the endpoint\ncase q = 2. Our construction of the sequence is analogous to Solimini's.\nLet v \u2208 C0\u221e ((e\u22123 , e\u22122 )), v 6= 0, let w(x) = v(|x|) and let\nwk = k\n\n\u22121/2\n\nk\nX\n\ng2j ,0 w, k \u2208 N.\n\n(2.21)\n\nj=1\n\nLet us show that, for an arbitrary sequence jk \u2192 \u221e and \u03b6k \u2208 \u03a9, one has\ngjk ,\u03b6k wk \u21c0 0.\n \u0301\nBy the standard density argument, it suffices to prove that gjk ,\u03b6k wk \u03c8 \u2192 0\nfor each \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (B). Indeed, since the supports for the individual terms in\nthe sum defining wk remain disjoint under the action of gjk ,\u03b6k ,\n\u0012\u02c6\n\ngjk ,\u03b6k wk \u03c8\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2264 kgjk ,\u03b6k wk k2 k\u03c8k2 ,\n\nand an elementary computation shows that\nkgjk ,\u03b6k wk k2 \u2264 kwk k22 \u2264 k \u22121 kwk22 \u2192 0.\nObserve now that the terms in the sum in (2.21) have disjoint supports, which\nimplies that k\u2207wk k2 = k\u2207wk2. Therefore we have a bounded sequence in\n10\n\n\fH01 (B) which converges D-weakly to zero.

None\nof the lemmas, except, possibly, Lemma 3.5, is a new result, but we have\nincluded them for the sake of completeness of the presentation. We recall\nthat the expression z j , j \u2208 N, refers to a power of the complex number z\nrepresenting a point in R2 , the set of operators D is defined by (2.15), and\nD-weak convergence is defined in Definition 2.1.\nWe start with the following elementary statement.\nD\n\nLemma 3.1. Let \u03a9\u0304 \u2282 B. If uk \u2208 H01(\u03a9) and uk \u21c0 0, then gjk ,\u03b6k uk \u21c0 0\nwhenever jk \u2208 N, \u03b6k \u2208 B.\nProof. For \u03b6k \u2208 \u03a9\u0304 the assertion follows directly from the definition of\nD\nD-weak convergence. For \u03b6k \u2208 B \\ \u03a9\u0304, note that uk \u21c0 0 implies\nuk \u21c0 0 and that operators gjk ,\u03b6k map any sequence uk \u21c0 0, such that\ninf k dist(\u03b6k , supp uk ) > 0 to a sequence that weakly converges to zero. Finally,\nthe case dist(\u03b6k , supp uk ) \u2192 0 can be easily reduced by a continuity argument\nto the case \u03b6k \u2208 \u03a9\u0304.\nIn what follows, the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure will be denoted\ndxdy when the integration variable is z, and d\u03bed\u03b7 when the integration\nvariable is called \u03b6.

Then, from the definition of the set Nk above and\nthe definition of gj,\u03b6 in (2.15), it follows that the set Nk contains the ball\n{z \u2208 B : |z|jk \u2264 \u03c15jk },\nthat is, Nk \u2283 B\u03c15 .\nWe conclude that gjk ,zk A\u03c1jk uk does not converge to zero in measure, and\nthus, A\u03c1jk uk does not converge to zero D-weakly. Then by Lemma 3.2, uk\ndoes not converge to zero D-weakly, which contradicts the assumption of the\ntheorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.1 Since Moser functional is lower weakly\nsemicontinuous by Fatou lemma, and since it is known that it lacks weak\ncontinuity on the unit ball of H01 (B) only at zero, we may assume without\nloss of generality that uk \u2208 H01 (\u03a9) is such that k\u2207uk k2 \u2264 1, uk \u21c0 0 and\nlim J(uk ) > J(0) = 0. Consider a renumbered subsequence of uk satisfying\n(2.20) and recall that the remainder there converges to zero in exp L2 by\nTheorem 2.6. Then, leaving details of separating supports to the reader, we\nhave\nX\n(n)\nJ(uk ) =\nJ(vk ) + o(1).\nn\u2208N\n\nwhere\n\n(n)\n\n(n) 1/2\n\nvk = jk\n\n(n)\n\nw (n) (|z \u2212 zn |1/jk )\n\nNote that since the argument of J converges weakly to zero and\n(n)\n(n)\nk\u2207vk k2 = k\u2207w (n) k2 , one has J(vk ) \u2192 0 whenever k\u2207w (n) k2 < 1. By\nassumption, lim J(uk ) > 0, which implies that for at least one value of n,\nk\u2207w (n) k2 \u2265 1. Without loss of generality assume that this value of n is 1.\nComparing this with (2.19), we conclude that w (n) = 0 whenever n > 1.\nTherefore\n(1)\nuk = vk + \u03c9k\nD\n\nwith \u03c9k \u21c0 0 and in particular, \u03c9k vanishes in exp L2 .\nD\n(1)\nNote now, that since \u03c9k \u21c0 0, one has (\u03c9k , vk ) \u2192 0, and, consequently,\n(1)\n\n1 \u2265 lim sup k\u2207uk k22 = lim sup k\u2207vk + \u2207\u03c9k k22 = 1 + lim sup k\u2207\u03c9k k22 .\nTherefore \u03c9k \u2192 0 in H 1 .\n(1)\nIf w (1) is not a Moser function, then by Proposition 3.6, J(vk ) \u2192 0.\nA slight modification of the proof of Proposition 3.6 gives also J(uk ) \u2192 0,\nwhich is a contradiction. Consequently, using (3.18), we have uk \u2212 msk \u2192 0\nin H 1 with some sequence sk \u2192 0, which proves the theorem.\n15\n\n\fAppendix A. Optimal imbeddings of Sobolev\nspaces into Lorentz-Zygmund spaces\nLet f : RN \u2192 R be a measurable function. The distribution function \u03b1f and\na nonincreasing rearrangement f \u22c6 of f are defined as follows:\n\u03b1f (s) = |{x \u2208 RN ; |f (x)| > s}| and f \u2217 (t) = inf{s > 0; \u03b1f (s) \u2264 t}.\nLorentz-Zygmund spaces Lp,q;\u03b1 , introduced by Bennett and Rudnick [5], is\na family of spaces that contains the both the Lorentz spaces Lp,q;0 = Lp,q\nand the Zygmund spaces L0,\u221e;\u2212\u03b1 = Z \u03b1 . They are defined as spaces of all\nmeasurable functions on a unit ball with bounded quasinorms\n\u0012\u02c6 1 h\niq dt \u0013 1q\ne\nkukp,q;\u03b1 =\n, q \u2208 (0, \u221e)\nt1/p (log )\u03b1 f \u22c6 (t)\nt\nt\n0\ne\nkukp,\u221e;\u03b1 = sup t1/p (log )\u03b1 f \u22c6 (t) , q = \u221e.\nt\nt\u2208(0,1)\n\n(3.13)\n\nFor the purpose of this paper we consider the range p \u2208 (1, \u221e). The definition\nof the Lorentz space Lp,q (RN ) is the same as the definition of Lp,q;0 above\nwith the domain of integration t \u2208 (0, \u221e) instead of t \u2208 (0, 1).\nLorentz space Lr,r is equivalent to the Lebesgue space Lr , and Lorentz\nspace Lr,\u221e is equivalent to the Marcinkiewicz space M r , also known as the\n\u2032\nweak-Lr space. Lorentz-Zygmund space L\u221e,\u221e,\u22121/N is equivalent to the Orlicz\n\u2032\nspace exp LN of the Moser functional.\nFor more background material on Lorentz and Lorentz-Zygmund spaces\nwe refer the reader to Bennett and Sharpley [6] and Bennett and Rudnick\n[5].\nThe reason why the domain of the functions considered here is a unit\nball, rather than RN , lies in the role of Lorentz-Zygmund spaces in the\nimbeddings of Sobolev spaces with the gradient norm. Completion D 1,N (RN )\nof the normed space C0\u221e (RN ) equipped with the norm k\u2207ukN on does not\nadmit a continuous imbedding even into the space of distributions, which\nmeans that the space D 1,N (RN ) cannot be consistently defined as a function\nspace. On the other hand, Friedrichs' inequality gives that the completion\nof C0\u221e (B) in the same gradient norm k\u2207ukN is continuously imbedded\ninto LN (B), defining the space W 1,N (B) with the equivalent Sobolev norm\nk\u2207ukN . It should be also noted that k\u2207ukN also expresses the gradient norm\n16\n\n\fof the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the hyperbolic space HN when written\nunder the coordinate map of Poincar\u00e9 ball, which allows to understand the\n\"Euclidean\" Sobolev space W01,N (B) of the unit ball in RN is isometric to the\nSobolev space \u1e86 1,N (HN ) of a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold,\ngiving the unit ball in RN when p = N an intuitively equal standing, when\nSobolev spaces are concerned, with the whole RN when p < N.\nIn fact, the similarities between D 1,p (RN ) for N > p, and W01,N (B),\nequipped with the gradient norm, are quite extensive. In particular, while the\nN\u2212p\nnorm D 1,p (RN ) remains invariant under dilations u 7\u2192 t p u(t*) also in the\ncase p = N (even if D 1,N (RN ) is no longer a functional space), the subspace\nof radial functions of W01,N (B) admits a different isometry group (3.17) of\nnonlinear dilations. There are also similarities in imbeddings of Sobolev\ntype into rearrangement-invariant spaces. While the standard limiting\nSobolev inequality and the Trudinger-Moser inequality are quite different\nin appearance, this difference finds its explanation when one considers\nimbeddings of Sobolev spaces into the scales of correspondent Lorentz or\nLorentz-Zygmund spaces.\nWe observe first that there is a continuous imbedding of D 1,p (RN ), N > p,\n\u2217\ninto Lp ,p , which is immediate from the Hardy inequality for u\u22c6 , combined\nwith the Polia-Szeg\u00f6 inequality. The analogous imbedding for p = N is\nW01,N (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,N ;\u22121 , based on the inequality of Hardy type\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n|u|N\nN\n\u221e\n|\u2207u| \u2265 CN\n\u0001 , u \u2208 C0 (B).\n1 N\nB\nB r log\nr\n(see Adimurthi and Sandeep [3] and Adimurthi and Sekar [2]; in the case\nN = 2 it was proved first by Leray [11]).\nLorentz spaces are nested with respect to the second index, and thus there\n\u2217\nis a continuous imbedding D 1,p (RN ) \u0592\u2192 Lp ,q , N > p, for all q \u2208 [p, \u221e]\n\u2032\nA continuous imbedding W01,N (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,\u221e;\u22121/N follows from the\ninequality (3.19) for radial functions (see e.g. [13]) for p = N, combined\nwith the Polia-Szeg\u00f6 inequality, and the H\u00f6lder inequality yields therefore\nthe following family of imbedding into Lorentz-Zygmund spaces when p = N:\n\u2032\nW01,N (B) \u0592\u2192 L\u221e,q;\u22121/q\u22121/N for p \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e.\nThe smallest of the target spaces corresponds to q = p in both cases,\nand, moreover, these imbeddings are optimal in the class of rearrangementinvariant spaces (see [6] for the definition), shown by Peetre [14] in the case\nN > p and by Brezis and Wainger [7] in the case p = N.\n17\n\n\fThe limiting Sobolev inequality and the Trudinger-Moser inequality are\noptimal in the sense that one cannot replace the correspondent nonlinearity\nby any other with a faster growth. Indeed, if h(s) is any continuous nondecreasing unbounded function on [0, \u221e), then\n\u02c6\nN\u2032\nh(|u|)e\u03b1N |u| dx = +\u221e,\nsup\nu\u2208W01,N (B),k\u2207ukN \u22641\n\nand\nsup\nu\u2208D 1,p (RN ),k\u2207ukp \u22641\n\nB\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u2217\n\nh(|u|)|u|p dx = +\u221e.\n\n\u03a9\n\nIn the case N > p this can be immediately seen by evaluating the\nN\u22122\nfunctional on t 2 u0 (tx) with t > 0 and u0 6= 0. In the case p = N, one\narrives at the similar conclusion by evaluation of the functional on the Moser\nfamily of functions (1.3) normalized in the norm of W01,N (B).\n\nAppendix B. Moser functional in the radial\ncase\nIn this appendix we list some basic properties of Moser functional on the\n1,N\n(B) of W01,N (B). In particular we show that, in\nradial subspace W0,r\nrestriction to radial functions, it is weakly continuous on any sequence, that\nis not, asymptotically, a sequence of concentrating Moser functions. This\nconclusion can be inferred from the original paper by Moser [13], while the\nnotations we use here are brought from the paper [4]. The calculations\ninvolved in this proof also allow to present the original Moser's proof of\nthe Trudinger-Moser inequality in a concise and streamlined form.\nLet mt , t \u2208 (0, 1), be the family of Moser functions (1.3) and consider the\n1,N\n(B):\nfollowing functional on W0,r\n\u02c6\ndef\n\u2217\n|\u2207mt |N \u22122 \u2207mt * \u2207u dx, t \u2208 (0, 1).\n(3.14)\nhmt , ui =\nB\n\nAn elementary computation shows that the functional m\u2217t is continuous\nand\n\u2032\n1/N\nhm\u2217t , ui = \u03c9N \u22121 log(1/t)\u22121/N u(t), t \u2208 (0, 1).\n(3.15)\n\n18\n\n\f1,N\nProposition 3.6. Let uk \u2208 W0,r\n(B), k\u2207uk kN \u2264 1, uk \u21c0 u and let J be the\nMoser functional (1.2). Then J(uk ) \u2192 J(u), unless the sequence uk has a\n1,N\n(B), with tk \u2192 0.\nrenamed subsequence such that uk \u2212 mtk \u2192 0 in W0,r\n\nProof. Let us substitute (3.15) into the definition of Moser functional. After\nelementary simplifications one arrives the following representation.\n\u0012\u02c6 1\n\u0013\nN (1\u2212hm\u2217t ,uiN ) dr\nJ(u) = \u03c9N \u22121\nr\n\u2212 1/N ,\n(3.16)\nr\n0\n1,N\nwhere u \u2208 W0,r\n(B) and k\u2207ukN = 1. Assume first that there exists \u01eb > 0\n\u2217\nsuch that hmt , uk iN \u2264 1 \u2212\u01eb. Then J(uk ) \u2192 J(u) by the Lebesgue dominated\nconvergence theorem. The remaining case is when for some tk \u2208 (0, 1),\n1,N\nuk \u2212 mtk \u2192 0 in W0,r\n(B). Assume first that the weak limit u is not\n1,N\n(B) for some\nzero. Then, necessarily, uk \u2192 mt in W0,r\n \u0301 t \u2208 (0,N1). This\nimplies the uniform convergence of uk on [t, 1] as well as Bt |\u2207uk | dx \u2192 0,\nfrom which easily follows J(uk ) \u2192 J(mt ). If uk = mtk + o(1) \u21c0 0 with\ntk \u2192 1, an argument repetitive of that for the case uk \u2192 mt above will\ngive J(uk ) \u2192 0 = J(u). We have, therefore, with necessity, a renamed\nsubsequence uk = mtk + o(1) with tk \u2192 0.\n\nLet\ndef\n\n1,N\nhs u(r) = s\u22121/N u(r s ), s > 0, u \u2208 W0,r\n(B),\n\u2032\n\n(3.17)\n\nElementary calculations show that the operators (3.17) form a\n1,N\nmultiplicative group of linear isometries on W0,r\n(B).
