PLANETARY NEBULAE WITH\nLOW-IONIZATION STRUCTURES\nThe main components of a planetary nebula \u2013\nspherical and elliptical shells, bright rims, bipolar\nlobes, and halos \u2013 are better identified in the light\nof hydrogen and helium recombination lines, as well\nas in the forbidden [O iii] lines. On the other\nhand, on usually smaller scales, the low-ionization\nstructures (LISs) are features selected because they\n\nare prominent in low-ionization lines (particularly\n[N ii]), fainter in H\u03b1, and almost undetectable in\n[O iii]. Of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) known to\ncontain LISs we find that 24% have real jets and\n18% have jet-like LISs. The features we call jetlike systems are highly collimated filaments: i) directed in the radial direction of the central star; ii)\nwhich appear in symmetrically opposite pairs; and,\nat variance with real jets, iii) move with relatively\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGON\u00c7ALVES ET AL.\n\nTABLE 1\nJETS VERSUS JET-LIKE LISS\nObject\nFg 1\nHb 4\nHe 2-186\nIC 4634\nK 4-47\nM 1-16\nNGC 3918\nNGC 6210\nNGC 6543\nNGC 6884\nNGC 6891\nNGC 7009\n\nJets\nKinem. agesa\nolder\nyounger\nolder\nolder\ncoeval\nyounger\nyounger\ncoeval\ncoeval\ncoeval\n\nb\n\nOrientation\n40\u25e6\n90\u25e6\n90\u25e6\n20\u25e6\n50\u25e6\n0\u25e6\n30\u25e6\n\nObject\nHe 2-249\nIC 4593\nK 1-2\nM 3-1d\nNGC 6309d\nNGC 6751\nNGC 6881\nNGC 7354d\nWray 17-1\n\nJet-like Systems\nKinem. data\nyes\nyes\nyes\nno\nno\nyes\nyes\nno\nyes\n\nOrientationb\n0\u25e6\n40\u25e6\n-\n\nLocationc\noutside\noutside\ninside\noutside\noutside\noutside\noutside\noutside\ninside\n\na) Quoted kinematic ages are those of the jets as compared to those of the main nebular shells.\nb) Orientation column shows the approximate angle of the LISs with respect to the major axis of the main shell.\nc) The apparent location of the tip of the jet-like system with respect to the swept-up shell.\nd) M 3-1, NGC 6309, and NGC 7354 do not have kinematic data along the LISs, thus they cannot be classified as jets.\n\nFig. 1.

Table 1 illustrates the main characteristics of jet-like LISs in contrast with those of the real jets. Those PNe that will\nbe discussed in this contribution are distinguished in\nthe table by bold letters.\n2. OUR DATA FOR JET-LIKE SYSTEMS\n2.1. K 1-2\nThis PN is composed of a low surface brightness, elliptically shaped main nebula (see in Fig.1\nthe morphology of the H\u03b1 emission), in addition to\na low-ionization jet-like system (at P.A.=\u201327\u25e6 and\nwell identified in both emission lines of Fig.1). K 1-2\nalso contains another system of knots that appears\n(projected on the plane of the sky) almost perpendicular to the first one.\nIts kinematics shows that the main elliptical shell\nhas an expansion velocity of 25 km s\u22121 (determined\nfrom the splitting of the H\u03b1 line emission), and that\nthe inner regions of the P.A.=27\u25e6 jet-like LIS share\nthe expansion of the shell in which they are embedded. Note, however, that the tail of this system\n(the feature we called A' in Fig.1) has a peculiar velocity, which increases outwards \u2013 accelerating from\n25 km s\u22121 at the shell position to 45 km s\u22121 at its\noutermost region (see Corradi et al. 1999 for a complete discussion of this object).\n2.2. IC 4593\nFrom the images in Fig.2 we see that IC 4593\nhas, in addition to its bright rim and asymmetrical\nshell, two systems of collimated LISs: a jet-like system (P.A.=\u201341\u25e6) and a pair of knots (P.A.=\u2013118\u25e6).\nResembling the case of K 1-2, also in this PN the two\nmain pairs of LISs are almost mutually perpendicular. The spectra of IC 4593 allow us to determine,\nfrom the velocity field in various lines, the heliocentric systemic velocity as being 21\u00b13 km s\u22121 (Fig.2).\nAlong the jet-like system, labeled ABB' (P.A.=\u201341\u25e6 )\nthe measured velocities do not differ from that of\nthe shell. Our analysis (Corradi et al. 1997) suggests that the low radial velocities measured for the\njet-like system are not due to projection effects \u2013 as\nargued by other outhors (Harrington & Borkowski\n2000) \u2013 thus showing that this is a real low-velocity\njet-like system.\n2.3. Wray 17-1\nFrom the detailed discussion of Corradi et al.\n(1999), Wray 17-1 possesses a diffuse elliptical shell\n([O iii] emission) and two collimated low-ionization\n\n3\n\nstructures ([N ii] and ratio images of Fig.3). The\njet-like system, at P.A.=\u201328\u25e6, has a direction (projected into the sky) completely different of that of\nthe pair of knots (at P.A.=\u2013103\u25e6). From the data\non the kinematics of this object, also in Fig. 3, we\ndetermined the expansion velocity of the main elliptical shell as being 28 km s\u22121 . As is shown in the\nposition\u2013velocity diagram, the jet-like system (except for its tail) is embedded in the 28 km s\u22121 shell\nand has radial velocities smaller or similar to those\nof the shell. Note, however, that the radial velocity\nof the tail A' is very peculiar; there is a velocity gradient of 90 km s\u22121 between A' and A. Considering\nthat A and A' are morphologically well aligned, we\nexplain this gradient as an ionization effect (Corradi\net al. 1999).\n3. THEORETICAL IDEAS FOR THE ORIGIN\nOF JET-LIKE LIS'S\nTheoretical models for the formation of collimated structures in planetary nebulae can be\nroughly grouped into two kinds: those based in the\ninteracting stellar winds (ISW models) and those\nthat consider the stellar and accretion-disk winds interaction (accretion-disk models). ISW models are\nrelated to the origin of collimated features in a singlestar scenario, while the latter ones deal with processes occurring in binaries. The formation of jets\nby the ISW process was pointed out by Frank, Balick & Livio (1996). Magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the ISW also proved to be successful in predicting some of the properties of the observed PNe\nwith jets (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura 1997; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura et al.\n1999). In particular, the observed linear relationship\nbetween the jet expansion velocity and the distance\nfrom the center is one of the predictions of the latter models, while new results of the stagnation zone\njets also predict this velocity behavior (see Steffen &\nL\u00f3pez, these proceedings). Jets originating from the\ninterplay of the accretion disk and stellar winds in\nPNe have been investigated by, for instance, Soker\n& Livio (1994), Livio & Pringle (1997), and ReyesRu\u0131\u0301z & L\u00f3pez (1999). Generally, what all the above\nmodels predict is the formation of i) two-sided highly\ncollimated features with supersonic velocities larger\nthan that of the main shell, ii) kinematic ages similar to (ISW models) or older than (accretion-disk\nmodels) that of the main shell, and iii) with an orientation that depends on the presence of precession,\nwobbling, or a misalignment between the main axis\nof the coupled system (Blackman, Frank & Welch\n2001; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura & L\u00f3pez 2001).\nOn the other hand, the fake jets presented here\n\n\f4\n\nGON\u00c7ALVES ET AL.\n\nFig. 2. ABOVE: H\u03b1 and [N ii] images of IC 4593. The left panel shows the inner rim and the asymmetrical shell, while\nthe jet-like system is better identified on the right. The field of view is 45\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 45\u2032\u2032 , with north at the top and east to the\nleft. BELOW: [N ii] position\u2013velocity plots superposed on the contour plots of the observed spectra along the jet-like\nsystem (ABB') and along the pair of knots (CC'). Circles represent the measured heliocentric velocities.\n\nFig. 3. ABOVE: [O iii], [N ii], and [O iii]/[N ii] images of Wray 17-1. The main shell is easily seen in the left panel,\nwhile the jet-like system (AB, A'B') and the pair of knots (CD) are better seen in the middle image. Note that the\nratio image puts in evidence the high collimation of the LIS. BELOW: spectra and PV plot of Wray 17-1, along the\njet-like features (P.A.=\u201328\u25e6 ). Open and filled circles represent [N ii] and H\u03b1 measured velocities, respectively, and are\ncorrected for the systemic velocity of the nebula.\n\nare a bit more difficult to explain. Their main characteristic \u2013 the one that makes them different from\ngenuine jets \u2013 is that their velocities are not peculiar\nwith respect to the surrounding medium. Note that\nmost jet-like systems are located (projected onto the\nsky) outside the swept-up shell of the host nebulae\n(as well as all the jets of Table 1. See also Table 2\nof Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2001). However, for two of the\ncases we show here the jet-like features are inside\nof the main shell. It seems that this property plays\nan important role when we try to compare observed\nproperties and theoretical predictions. This is particularly true when we analyze certain details of the\nresults found by R\u00f3\u017cyczka & Franco (1996) \u2013 the first\npaper proposing magnetized interacting stellar winds\nto produce jets in PNe \u2013 since their simulations show\nthe formation of two pairs of well collimated flows\n(one pair per stagnation region, which are in the polar regions of the main shell), and in every pair one\nof the flows is of low velocity and directed toward the\ncentral star, and the other is of high velocity and expanding away from it. The stagnation zone jets of\nSteffen & L\u00f3pez (these proceedings) appear to produce low-velocity collimated features as well. Note,\nhowever, that in both models the low-velocity jetlike systems develop inside the swept-up shell, and\nthat this is not the case for four of the six PNe containing jet-like systems that are well studied (see last\ncolumn of Table 1). Another important issue is the\nlifetime of the low-velocity features that would arise\nduring the evolution of the interacting winds of the\nabove cited models. Unfortunately, this information\nis not easily obtained from the observations since the\nuseful comparison between kinematic ages of nebular components do not apply in this case. Therefore,\nthe actual origin of the low-velocity jet-like system\nin PNe is clearly a challenge for further exploration.\n\nIt is with pleasure that DRG acknowledges A.\nRaga and L.
