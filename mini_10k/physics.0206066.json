Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\n1. Introduction\nIn certain three-dimensional tissue culture settings, highly malignant human brain tumors\ncan form a remarkable growth pattern, consisting of central proliferation and invasive\nspread into the periphery1. In the brain itself, these tumors may grow in a similar way. In\nthe initial stages the tumor grows more or less symmetrically until (presumably)\nmechanical confinement pressure increases to a critical level, and an invasive phase is\ntriggered. In this phase the central multicellular tumor spheroid (MTS) continues to grow,\nbut also there is rapid invasion of surrounding tissue by mobile tumor cells, which are\ncontinually shed by the MTS at several stages. In these stages chains of single cells can\nbranch and extend around the core in an invasive zone. It is this rapid and extensive\ninvasion of brain parenchyma surrounding the main macroscopic tumor, which makes\nthis terrible disease so difficult to treat 2. This paper will introduce a model that has some\nof the salient features of this process.\nSome of the features of the growth and invasion have been revealed by in vitro\nexperiments in transparent extracellular matrix gel1: see Figure 1. The branching pattern\nsurrounding the central core is the invasive zone, which grows with a maximum velocity\nof about 4.5 \u03bcm/hr, which in turn corresponds well with values obtained from in vivo\nexperiments3. Our interest here is to try to understand the mechanism for the formation of\nthe branching structures.\nIt seems clear that we are dealing here with a growth instability. In fact, there is\nconsiderable qualitative resemblance between the pattern of Figure 1 and the well-known\ndiffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) pattern4 or biological patterns such as those\nencountered in nutrient-limited growth of bacteria colonies5. Modeling of a similar kind\nhas been used for cancers other than brain tumors6. In these biological cases the basic\npattern is determined by enhanced proliferation of tumor cells at well-nourished tips of\nbranches. This leads to unstable growth of the branches exactly as in the classic MullinsSekerka instability of metallurgy7.\nHowever, the biology of brain tumors is different from that of bacteria colonies in\nthe important respect that the invasive cells are thought to exhibit very little proliferative\nactivity\n\n8,9\n\n. This means, that all (or most) of the new cells are produced at the surface of\n\nthe MTS, and then invade the surrounding tissue. Secondary tumors may form at distant\n2\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nsites (compare also with Deisboeck et al., 1), yet the branch formation in Figure 1 is\nsupplied from the MTS core, or more accurately from its highly proliferative cell surface\nlayers (see also next section). The invasive cells move in response to various chemical\nand material gradients in the tissue and, we assume that there is a similar mechanism for\nthe in vitro assay. That is, their motion is governed by chemotaxis and haptotaxis, though,\nin what follows we will neglect haptotaxis.\nIn our model, we will assume that the growth of the invasive branches is governed\nby two major processes: (i) Chemotaxis caused by the gradient of (heterotype) nutrient\nconcentration. In the experiment, a (non-replenished) nutrient medium is mixed with the\nbio-gel, and it is consumed by the growing tumor (see the next section for details). This,\nhowever, would merely lead to an expanding cloud of mobile cells. (ii) Homotype\nattraction, another form of chemotaxis where cells secrete a soluble agent (paracrine\nproduction) which attracts other cells. There also may be tissue damage by the invading\ncells, which gives rise to pathways which other cells can follow more easily.\nIn the next section we give more details about the biological background of\nexperiments and concepts. We show, for a simplified continuum model that we can get\nbranch formation from a combination of heterotype and homotype attraction (both are\nnecessary). We then introduce a hybrid discrete-continuum model for the tumor\nexpansion. Our simulation results, in the following section, show that there are regimes of\nbranch formation depending on the strength of various effects, and these are, in some\nmeasure, found in the experiment. Finally we summarize our results, and point out\ndirections for future modeling efforts.\n\n2. Experimental Background\n2.1. Experimental Results\nWe developed an experimental model, which uses multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS 10)\nimplanted into a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) gel. This sandwich MTS assay is\ndescribed in detail in Deisboeck et al.1 In brief, we placed human U87MG\u2206EGFR11\nmulticellular glioma spheroids (\u2205 = 500-700 \u03bcm; 0.7-1.0 x 104 cells) in between two\nlayers of growth factor reduced (GFR) matrix, Matrigel\uf8e8 (BIOCAT\uf8e8, Becton\n\n3\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which forms a reconstituted basement membrane at\nroom temperature. It has been shown that such basement membranes have distinct\nnetwork structure12. This specific GFR-matrix variant contains less growth factor (e.g.,\nEGF, PDGF, TGF-\u03b2) as compared to the full Matrigel, however a similar amount of the\nECM proteins laminin (61%), collagen IV (30%) and entactin (7%). We then mixed this\ngel with (serum-free) OPTI-MEM\uf8e8 to a ratio of 3:1 GFR-M to medium, reaching a total\nvolume of 200 \u03bcl (per well; using a 48-well flat bottom tissue culture treated Multiwell\uf6db\nplate (FALCON\uf8e8, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA)).\nAs reported previously in Deisboeck et al.1, over 144 hrs, the volumetric growth\nfollowed decelerating kinetics reaching on average 0.403 mm3. During the same period\ninvasion increased significantly up to 1.705 mm2 at the end of the observation period.\nThe experimental model also showed a steep increase in invasive edge cell velocity\nreaching a peak of 109 \u03bcm/day at t = 96 hrs. Specific immunohistochemistry staining\nrevealed an inverse relationship between MTS size and proliferative index. Also, the\nproliferative cells tended to be more densely arranged in the surface layers of the MTS\nwhereas in the center of the larger MTS cells were less dense with separate lucid areas\nand apoptotic nuclei.\nFigure 1 depicts two microscopic sample images from tumor spheroids at 120\nhours (after placement into the 3D ECM gel (using the same gel composition in both\nexperiments)). Figure 1a shows \"chain-like\" invasion patterns, whereas the MTS system\nin Figure 1b displays a more \"disc-like\" invasive pattern. Invasion in both MTS\nexperiments is predominantly 2D because of the design of the experiment1. At this time\npoint, the average MTS volume was 0.356 mm3 and the average MTS invasion area was\n1.394 mm2.\n2.2. Modeling Background\nUsing the methods of the previous section we were able to study the evolving tumor with\nits key features of proliferation and invasion for up two six to eight days without\nreplenishing the nutrient supply. Volumetric growth follows Gompertzian dynamics13\nTumor growth and invasion were closely related and in fact showed evidence of\nfeedback1, (which we do not treat in this paper.) We can see in Figure 1 that invasive\n\n4\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\ntumor cells often seemed to follow one another forming a chain, previously only shown\nfor neural precursor cells14. We take this as evidence for homotype attraction of cells for\none another. The biological correlate for the attractant(s) is the paracrine production of\nsoluble protein growth factors, e.g., TGF-\u03b1 and HGF/SF by tumor cells\n\n15,16,17\n\n. Mobile\n\ncells would follow each other because of increasing paracrine attraction. There is also the\npossibility of smaller mechanical resistance in a preformed channel. Such a mechanism\nwould lead to a continuous imprinting of (initially random) invasive pathways.\n\n3. Formulation of the Model\n3.1. Continuum Modeling\nThe major features that we want to include in our description of the mobile tumor cells\nare the following: cells are shed from the MTS and, in the absence of other forces,\nundergo random motion, i.e. diffusion. In continuum terms, the cells obey a diffusion\nequation with a diffusion coefficient, Dc. In addition, there is chemotaxis, i.e. directed\nactive motion along chemical gradients. These effects are described by the usual KellerSegel equation 18:\n\u2202c/\u2202t = \u2207[Dc(r)\u2207c] - \u2207[c\u2207\u03c7(n,r)\u2207n] - \u2207[c\u03b7\u2207h]\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere c is the concentration of mobile cells, and n, the concentration of nutrient which\nguides the motion of the cells. For the chemotaxis coefficient, \u03c7, we use the receptor\nlaw: \u03c7 = \u03b2(r)n2o /(no + n) 2 . The characteristic concentration, no, will be discussed further,\nbelow. Here, \u03b2 gives the scale of the chemotaxis, i.e., the drift velocity, which a cell\nacquires in unit gradient of nutrient. This drift velocity accounts for a roughly linear\ngrowth law of the invasive zone. The last term is the homotype attraction mediated by a\nfactor whose concentration is h, and whose chemotaxis coefficient (taken to be constant\nfor simplicity) is \u03b7.\nIn our discrete simulation, below, we will allow both Dc and \u03b2 to depend on\nposition. This is to take into account the effect of tissue damage: we simply make it easier\nfor a cell to move where other cells have previously been by multiplying \u03b2 and Dc by a\ndimensionless factor, \u03b31, which will be a parameter. This is a very crude representation of\n\n5\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nthese effects, but it will allow us to show, in a fairly simple way, how branch formation\noccurs in a discrete model.\nThe boundary condition on c at the surface of the MTS corresponds to generation\nof cells as they are shed. As described above, we do not consider proliferation of cells in\nthe invasive zone, based on experimental evidence 8,9. In this respect our approach differs\nsharply from that of Burgess et al. 19 who, instead, write an equation of the form:\n\u2202c / \u2202t = \u2207[Dc\u2207c] + gc(co \u2212 c)\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith logistic growth throughout the invasive zone, and no chemotaxis. This equation is of\nthe form of a Fisher-Kolmogorov20 equation, and has traveling front solutions with a\nfixed velocity,\nv = 2 Dc gco\n\n(3.3)\n\ndue to the exponential growth of c. The authors use this equation to compute the diffusion\ncoefficient.\nHowever, our point of view is quite different. If we adopt an equation of the form\nof (3.2), we would have to put the growth term only on the surface of the MTS. We can\nsee the difficulty with this if we idealize the MTS as a point source of new cells, and\nwrite:\n\u2202c / \u2202t = \u2207[Dc\u2207c] + G\u03b4(r)\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis equation is not difficult to solve. We get:\nt\n\nc(r,t) \u221d \u222b \u03c4 \u22121/2 e\u2212r\n\n2\n\n/4 D\u03c4\n\nd\u03c4 \u2248( t \u2212 r \u03c0 /4 D...)\n\n(3.5)\n\n0\n\nwhere we have written the limit for small r. That is, as in any diffusion problem, contours\nof constant c move according to r~t1/2, not with fixed velocity. In order to get a fixed\nvelocity we need a chemotaxis (drift) term like the second term in Eq.(3.1).\nWe also need an equation for the nutrient concentration, n. In the experiments that\nwe have in mind there are several constituents of the nutrient used, but, for simplicity we\nwill think about a single species such as glucose. Thus we have simple diffusion with a\nlarge diffusion constant, Dn, and consumption of the nutrient by the mobile cells, and also\nby those belonging to the MTS.\n\u2202n /\u2202t = Dn \u22072 n \u2212\u03b1 (n)c\n\n(3.6)\n\n6\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nHere the last term corresponds to consumption of nutrient by the cells, and \u03b1(n), is a\nfunction giving the overall scale of nutrient consumption. Experiments with cultured\nbrain cancer cells 21 show that \u03b1(n) is well represented by:\n\u03b1(n) = \u03b1\u03bf n/n1 n \u2264 n1\n\u03b1\u03bf\n\n(3.7)\n\nn>n1\n\nwhere n1 is a characteristic saturation concentration. It is reasonable that n1\u2248 n o, and we\nwill make this assumption.\nFor the MTS, we assume the consumption is large, given the large number of\nhighly proliferative cells in the surface layers. In order to avoid complications we set n=0\non the surface of the MTS. Far from the tumor we have a boundary condition: n=n\u221e,\nwhere n\u221e is the nutrient concentration introduced at the beginning of the experiment, or,\nin the brain, the general supply.\nFinally, we need an equation for the homotype factor, h. We use a diffusion\nequation, again, and suppose that this factor is produced by the mobile cells at a rate, \u03bb.\nIn order to avoid a large buildup of this factor we assume that it decays at a rate, \u03bc. Thus\nwe have:\n\n\u2202h /\u2202t = Dh \u2207 2 h \u2212 \u03bch + \u03bbc\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere Dh is the corresponding diffusion coefficient. As we will see, in order to form\nbranches, Dh needs to be smaller than Dc.\n3.2. Estimate of the Parameters\nIn order to proceed with a solution of the equations above, we need to know a number of\nparameters. In this section we will try to use experimental numbers insofar as possible\nand we will quote a number of quantities. These should be regarded as order-ofmagnitude estimates for the specific experiment, which we are trying to explain, and still\nmore so for the situation in vivo where many other effects such as inhomogeneity of the\nenvironment can play an important role. The point of the enterprise is to see whether the\nparameters we use in the simulation are reasonable.\nWe turn first to Eq. (3.6). The diffusion coefficient of glucose in the brain is\nknown to be Dn=6.7 x 10-7 cm2/sec 22. The saturation consumption has been measured, \u03b1=\n\n7\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\n1.6 pg/cell/min 21. Also, n1= 0.2 g/l. Note that this is within a factor of three of n\u221e = 0.6\ng/l for the experiment1.\nWe should note that for our purposes Eq. (3.6) may simplified because the time\nscale for the diffusion of the nutrient is much faster than that of the cells, thus we may set\n\u2202n/\u2202t = 0, and write the equation in the following form (for n>no):\na 2\u2207 2(n/ n\u221e ) = [\u03b1 oa2 / Dn n\u221e \u03a9](\u03a9c)\n\n(3.9)\n\nHere we have measured c in terms of the cell volume, \u03a9, n in terms of n\u221e, and multiplied\nby the square of a length scale (a typical cell diameter), a, which we take to be 10\u03bcm.\nThe dimensionless group in brackets, \u03b3 2 = \u03b1o a 2 / Dn n\u221e\u03a9 turns out to be of order 0.1. It is\na parameter that we need for our simulations.\nFor Eq. (3.1) we need Dc, the diffusion constant of brain tumor cells in tissue. The\nonly direct measurement that we know of, by Burgess et al.19, gives 1.7 x 10-9 cm2/sec.\nHowever, this value depends on interpreting data according to Eq. (3.2). We have\nexplained above why we cannot accept this value from a tumor biology standpoint. Our\npoint of view is that the velocity of the edge of the invasive zone, v, depends primarily on\nthe chemotaxis, and is independent of the random motion of the cells.\nWe have been unable to find a direct measurement of the random diffusion of\nsingle invasive cells so that we are reduced to very crude estimates. We may state the\nproblem as that of finding the 'jump time', \u03c4, i.e., the time required for a cell to move its\nown length in a random walk, \u03c4 = a2 /D c. For example, in the experiment of Chicoine et\nal.3 a cell in a petri dish takes several hours to perform such a motion, and we may expect\nthat in the brain, or within the gel medium of our experiment, the time will be longer. As\na complete guess we suppose this time to be of order 10 hours. This amounts to guessing\nthat Dc ~ 10-12 cm2/sec. We are aware of the weakness of this chain of reasoning.\nFor the chemotaxis term we have a measurement3 of the maximum drift velocity\nof mobile cells: v=4.8 \u03bcm/hr (which corresponds very well to the 4.5 \u03bcm/hr measured\nafter 96 hrs in our 3D MTS assay1). Eq. (3.1) gives the drift velocity as:\nv=\n\n1\n\u03b2n\u221e\u2207[n / n\u221e ]\n16\n\n(3.10)\n\nHere the factor 1/16 comes from the receptor law. We may estimate the gradient in which\nthe cells move by assuming that the nutrient recovers its full concentration in\n8\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\napproximately the radius of the MTS, about 1mm. Thus \u03b2n\u221e \u2248 2 x 10 -7 cm2/sec. We note\nthat this has the units of a diffusion constant, so we define our third dimensionless\nparameter, \u03b33 = \u03b2n\u221e/Dc \u2248 100.\nMuch less is known about the dynamics of the homotype factor. We note that if a\nsteady state is attained in Eq. (3.8), the ratio of the concentration of homotype factor, ho,\nto cancer cells, co, is ho /c o = \u03bb /\u03bc \u2261 \u03b3 4 , another dimensionless parameter. It will be\nconvenient to measure the decay rate, \u03bc, in terms of the jump time, and set \u03b35=Dc\u03bc/a2=\n\u03bc\u03c4. We can parameterize the strength of the chemotaxis induced by h by noting that\n\u03b36=\u03b7ho/Dc is a dimensionless group, which gives the relative importance of the first and\nlast terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (1). Finally, we need to know the ratio of\ndiffusion coefficients, \u03b37=Dh/Dc. These three parameters are not known, even in order of\nmagnitude. The same is true of \u03b31, which characterizes the homotype attraction in another\nway. In fact, understanding the role of these parameters, is the point of our enterprise\nhere. We will attempt to deduce them from the pattern itself.\nIt is disturbing that we have seven parameters in this problem. However, we have\nbeen able to estimate two of them, and, as we will see, the general nature of the patterns\nis not terribly sensitive to the others. Also, we suggest that future experiments could be\noriented to finding out more about the homotype factor.\n\n4. Stability Analysis\nIn order to see whether chains of cells (forming the branches in Figure 1) are likely to be\nformed in our model, we start with a simplified two-dimensional continuum approach.\nSuppose that we consider a channel (a part of the invasive zone) with cells supplied at\nconcentration co at one end. Cells drift in the x-direction, with drift velocity, u, because of\na fixed gradient of nutrient. The channel has a finite width, L, in the y-direction, and we\nuse periodic boundary conditions. According to Eq. (3.8) there will be a steady state with\na fixed concentration, ho =\u03b34 co, of homotype factor. The question we pose is whether this\nuniform steady state is stable. It turns out not to be, and the growth of the instability\nshows how branches start to form.\nIn our stability analysis we write:\nc= co( 1+C )\n\nh= ho(1+H )\n\n(4.1)\n9\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nwhere C, H, are small deviations from the steady state. We then rewrite linearized forms\nof Eqs. (3.1), (3.8) in terms of these variables. Further, we set r= a\u03c1, using a, the cell\ndiameter, to rescale spatial variables, and t= (a2 /Dc )T, scaling time by the jump time.\nWe find:\n\n\u2202C /\u2202T = \u2207 2\u03c1 C \u2212 (au /Dc ) \u2022\u2207 \u03c1 C \u2212 \u03b3 6\u2207 2\u03c1 H\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u2202H /\u2202T = \u03b3 7\u2207 2\u03c1 H \u2212 \u03b3 5 (C \u2212 H)\n\n(4.3)\n\nIn order to fix our ideas we will take a model set of parameters as follows: \u03b35=.05,\ncorresponding to slow decay of the homotype agent, and \u03b36=5, i.e., moderately strong\nchemotaxis from the homotype agent. The ratio of diffusion coefficients, \u03b37, needs to be\nless than unity for a strong attraction to occur, so we take it to be 0.1. Finally, we can\nestimate the term au/Dc, from the previous section to be of order 3.\nThese are linear equations, and we seek a solution of the form:\nC, H ~ exp (\u03c9T - iQ\u2022\u03c1)\n\n(4.4)\n\nHere the (dimensionless) growth rate of the instability, \u03c9, plays the role of an eigenvalue,\nand the wavevector (in units of 1/a), Q, controls the spatial variation. The dispersion\nrelation, \u03c9(Q), gives the growth of instabilities for various wavelengths; positive \u03c9\ncorresponds to unstable behavior. In Figure 2 we plot the dispersion relation for Q in the\nx-direction and the y-direction, for the parameters quoted above. The same general\nbehavior is true over a large range in parameter space, namely instability at long\nwavelength (small Q), and stability at short wavelength.\nWe should note that the instability in the y-direction, i.e., across the channel, is\nstronger than that in the x-direction. In effect, the instability is advected by the drift\nvelocity, u. In order to see the effect on an initial perturbation, we suppose that there is a\nsmall deviation from a uniform distribution of cells, and then propagate it forward in time\nusing Eq. (4.2), (4.3). The equations can be solved exactly using Fourier Transforms, and\nthis is what we did. The result is shown in Figure 3. The initial cell cluster, on the left, is\ncarried forward by the drift, and increases in size by robbing material from the rest of the\nchannel. This is incipient branch formation due to the combination of heterotype and\nhomotype chemotaxis. Note that both are necessary to form this structure.\n\n10\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\n5. Discrete Simulation Model\n5.1. Formulation\nIn the previous section we showed a linear analysis of the formation of a branch in the\ninvasive zone. Here we will take a complementary approach and do a discrete simulation.\nIn this case we represent the homotype factor by an extreme approximation: we assume it\ndoes not diffuse at all, so that each cell leaves a 'trail' which other cells follow.\nAlternately, we could interpret the model as representing the case where each cell carves\na 'least resistance' pathway for others to follow.\nWe work on a 128x128 square lattice, with the lattice constant equal to a, the cell\ndiameter. We treat the nutrient concentration as a continuous variable and the tumor cells\nas discrete. For the nutrient we solve Eq. (3.6) numerically on the lattice. If we write\nN = n / n\u221e , then Eq. (3.6) becomes:\n\u2206 2N = \u03b3 2Cf (N)\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere f(N)=N, N <1/3, f=1, otherwise (cf. Eq. (3.7)), \u22062 is a second numerical difference,\nand C is 1 or 0 depending on whether a cell occupies that lattice site. Eq. (5.1) is\nstandard: it is a discrete version of the Helmholtz equation. We have solved it using the\nstrongly implicit scheme.\nFor the cells, and represent the various processes by a set of jump probabilities.\nOur basic rate is the random walk rate for cells (c.f. the previous section). Each cell can\njump to any empty adjacent site with rate w(0) = 1, unless it is either in a gradient of N, or\nif it undergoes homotype attraction. In the former case we put:\nw(N) = \u03b3 3 (3N +1)\u2212 2 \u2206N\n\n(5.2)\n\nif \u2206N, the numerical gradient of N in that direction, is positive. The second factor comes\nfrom the receptor law. For the homotype attraction, we keep track of the places where\nany cell has previously been. If that site has been visited we multiply each jump rate by\n\u03b31. As the simulation proceeds we pick processes according to their relative jump rates.\nShowing that this discrete process reduces to Eq. (3.1) when viewed on large space and\ntime scales is a standard exercise in stochastic analysis 23. For the MTS we take a disk of\nimmobile cells and start with about 100 mobile cells around it. In order to speed up the\nsubsequent calculations we take a somewhat irregular initial distribution of these cells. In\n11\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nthe course of the growth we allow any empty site near the immobile cells to either shed a\nnew mobile cell, or to grow the MTS, with a certain relative probability. Our intention is\nto use this parameter to match the known growth history of the MTS, but we have not yet\ndone this systematically.\n5.2. Results\nWe show the results of simulation in three regimes in Figure 4 and Figure 5. In all cases\nwe started with a tumor core of a radius of 20 cells, and liberated 100 cells to start\ninvasion. We have taken \u03b32, the parameter which characterizes consumption of nutrient as\n0.3, in the range we estimated above. The three images are representative of three\nregimes for the other two parameters. It will be important in future work to map out the\nvarious parameter regimes in more detail and see to what extent we can understand the\nunderlying processes. The general scale of the figures can be thought of as being about\n1mm, as in the experiment. In Figure 4a we have basically turned off both, chemotaxis\nand homotype attraction: \u03b31 =5, \u03b33 = 5. In this case we have a typical result of diffusion:\nrandom walks are compact in two dimensions, and the cloud of cells near the MTS does\nnot represent the invasive pattern of Figure 1. We conclude that it takes strong\nchemotaxis (or some equivalent phenomenon) to generate an invasive zone.\nIn Figure 4b we thus implemented strong chemotaxis, \u03b33 = 100, in the regime that\nwe estimated above. We also took \u03b31 =25, i.e., rather strong homotype attraction. In this\npattern (Figure 4b) we see a dispersed zone of invading cells, yet only a hint of chain\nformation. However, this sort of pattern is observed in the experiment (cf. Figure 1b). It\nwill be important to revisit the experiment in a systematic manner to try to understand\nhow this pattern evolves.\nWe find that in order to produce well-defined chain structures, in Figure 5 (cf.\nFigure 1a), we need to introduce very strong homotype attraction, \u03b31 =250, and also very\nstrong heterotype chemotaxis, perhaps a factor of 10 larger than we estimated above.\nThis might indicate that chemical triggers other than only glucose might be involved.\nWith regards to the in vitro assay there are numerous candidate substances in the tissue\nculture medium as well as in the gel, and many more soluble factors are likely to have an\nimpact in the real brain parenchyma. We are encouraged however by the fact that the\n\n12\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nmodel can produce chains at all without putting in an artificial device, which does not\ncorrespond to the biology that we understand.\n\n6. SUMMARY\nThis preliminary study introduces a new computational model, which attempts to clarify\nthe pattern of highly malignant tumor growth, in particular the origin and structure of the\ninvasive zone. We have attempted to remain grounded in the biology of the tumor, yet we\nhave, even in this preliminary study, already revealed a number of interesting features.\nThe nature of the pattern formation here is quite different from that assumed by\nother authors for related systems such as bacteria colonies5. In that case, the biology is\ndifferent, in that bacteria reproduce while in motion. Thus the diffusive instability that\ngives rise to the branching shapes in bacteria colonies, which are very well represented\nby DLA. Our case is different despite the visual resemblance of the patterns, and the\npattern formation is considerably more subtle. As such, this has model is interesting for\nstatistical physics, quite apart from the application we have in mind. We should note,\nhowever, that our discrete simulation method is similar to that of Ben-Jacob et al. 5 , and\nthe diffusive instability is present here, as it is in the bacteria colonies: tumor cells that\nare far in advance of the rest of the tumor system consume nutrient, and tend to get even\nfarther ahead.\nOur results persuade us that chemotaxis is a driving force in forming the invasive\nzone, and this prediction can be tested. We propose that the invasive zone would slow its\nexpansion considerably in situations where the main tumor mass is very well-nourished.\nThe other ingredient in our model, the homotype attraction, is treated in a very schematic\nway here. In this form, it does give the qualitative effect that we are looking for, but the\ndetails of the process will need considerable work both in modeling and in understanding\nthe underlying biological processes.\nWe are aware that several important features are not yet included in the model.\nFor example, we have made no mention of haptotaxis. Haptotaxis refers to enhanced\nmovement on a solid permissive substrate, e.g., the laminin and collagen fibers present\nwithin the matrigel used in here, and certainly in vivo. It is noteworthy that glioma tumor\ncells also produce extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin\n\n24,25\n\n, thus further\n\n13\n\n\fL.M. Sander, T.S. Deisboeck: Growth Patterns of Microscopic Brain Tumors (06-06-02)\n\nimprinting the pathway structure with increased permission on paracrine secreted, solid\nsubstrates. As such, aside from chemotaxis, haptotaxis also contributes to the observed\nbranching patterns and thus needs to be considered for future work.\nWe have also completely neglected effects arising from the elasticity of the tissue\nsurrounding the growing tumor. A growing core certainly strains the material, and this\nmay affect the migrating cells, though the effect is not trivial since it can be shown that\nan expanding sphere in an elastic medium gives rise to a pure shear, i.e., local volumes\nare not changed, but rather deformed. We suspect that the important elastic effects are\nnon-linear ones - this is quite likely in a gel, and presumably also in brain tissue. Aside\nfrom pure expansion, the mechanical effects of cell traction, i.e., tension, especially in the\nECM-gel used in the experimental assay likely also need to be considered and our own\npreliminary experimental findings already support this notion. Another effect, which\nshould be thought about in this context is the possibility of a kind of local fracture from\nthe mobile cells enhancing the damage to the tissue, and favoring chain formation. In\nbrain parenchyma, such micro-fractures may also lead to a decrease in the tissue\nconsistency, thus reduce the mechanical confinement surrounding the main tumor mass.\nThat would allow the tumor to continue its volumetric growth, which in turn would shed\n(in total) even more invasive cells. Interestingly, such a feedback pattern has indeed been\nobserved in vitro, represented by the damped oscillations of the dynamic ratio between\nvolumetric growth of the MTS and the invasive front1.\nIn future work we intend to first map out in detail the parameter space for this n\nmodel, and to attempt to put in the observed growth profile of the MTS. We will then\nalso study the effects of inhomogeneity of the 3D matrix, which should facilitate spatial\nexpansion into directions of least resistance. More specifically, we plan to map out the\nresponse of the formation of the invasive zone to easier paths of motion (including\nhaptotaxis). This effort will also help us determine more carefully the diffusion\ncoefficient of brain tumor cells in such 3D heterogeneous biological media.\nA better understanding of the processes governing the onset and the dynamics of\nmulticellular tumor invasion would be of great significance for tumor biology research\nand an important step towards the development of novel diagnostic tools and innovative\ntreatment approaches in the future.\n14\n\n\fL.M.
