We track the\ndominant mechanisms for interconversion of N2 -NH3 and HCN-NH3 in the deep, hightemperature troposphere and predict the rate-limiting step for the quenching of HCN\nat cooler tropospheric altitudes. Consistent with other investigations that were based\nsolely on time-scale arguments, our models suggest that transport-induced quenching of\nthermochemically derived HCN leads to very small predicted mole fractions of hydrogen\ncyanide in Jupiter's upper troposphere. By the same token, photochemical production\nof HCN is ineffective in Jupiter's troposphere: CH4 -NH3 coupling is inhibited by the\nphysical separation of the CH4 photolysis region in the upper stratosphere from the\nNH3 photolysis and condensation region in the troposphere, and C2 H2 -NH3 coupling is\ninhibited by the low tropospheric abundance of C2 H2 . The upper limits from infrared\nand submillimeter observations can be used to place constraints on the production of\nHCN and other species from lightning and thundershock sources.\n\n\f4\n1. Introduction\nAlthough hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was detected in the Jovian stratosphere following the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts,1\u22129 no convincing observational evidence\nexists for the presence of non-cometary HCN in Jupiter's troposphere. Tentative detections of HCN from the 1960's and 1970's have all been discounted.10 The most credible\nreport of the detection of non-cometary HCN on Jupiter resulted from ground-based\n13.5 \u03bcm observations of three spectral lines by Tokunaga et al.;11 however, this detection is now considered dubious due to the lack of confirmation from subsequent infrared,\nsub-millimeter, and millimeter observations.12\u221215 B\u00e9zard et al.13 suggest that one of the\npurported HCN absorption lines identified by Tokunaga et al.11 is actually an expected\n\"valley\" between two nearby C2 H2 emission lines, a second absorption line is much narrower than it would be if caused by HCN (and is likely an instrument artifact), and the\nidentification of the third line is suspect due to uncertainties in the position (frequency)\nof the feature. From recent 850-\u03bcm observations, a strict upper limit of 0.93 ppb has\nbeen placed on the Jovian tropospheric HCN mole fraction, assuming HCN condenses\nin the upper troposphere, or as small as 0.16 ppb if the HCN is assumed to be uniformly\nmixed throughout the troposphere and stratosphere.15\nThe production of hydrogen cyanide and other nitrogen-bearing organics in reducing atmospheres such as that of Jupiter has attracted considerable interest in the past\nhalf century due to prebiological chemistry implications16 and to the long-standing puzzle\nof the cloud coloring agents on Jupiter, for which it has been suggested that HCN polymers could play a role.17,18 The HCN abundance is expected to be negligible in thermochemical equilibrium at the cold atmospheric levels that can be probed by remote-sensing\nobservations,19 but several disequilibrium processes could supply HCN to the Jovian\ntroposphere. These processes include rapid transport from the deep troposphere,10,19\u221221\nphotochemical processing of CH3 NH2 dredged up from the deep atmosphere,10 lightning\nand related processes in thunderstorms,17,22\u221226 coupled CH4 -NH3 photochemistry,27\u221234\nand coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry.35\u221240\nKaye and Strobel35 and Lewis and Fegley10 have evaluated the various disequilibrium processes for HCN production and conclude that NH3 -C2 H2 photochemical coupling\nis the most plausible mechanism for producing HCN on Jupiter - HCN production from\nthe chemistry of hot H atoms released from NH3 (or H2 S) photolysis in the presence of\nmethane is inhibited under Jovian conditions because of rapid hot-atom thermalization\n\n\f5\nfrom collisions with H2 ,31,41,42 photochemical production of the HCN precursor CH3 NH2\nis inhibited due to an insufficient source of CH3 in the NH3 photolysis region,29,34 and\nlightning and thunder shockwave production of HCN appears to be inadequate when\nobserved production efficiencies in realistic laboratory discharge and shock-synthesis experiments are scaled to Jovian conditions.10,23 We point out, however, that Bar-Nun\nand Podolak24 and Podolak and Bar-Nun25 continue to favor the thundershock hypothesis, and Fegley and Lodders20 and Lodders and Fegley21 still support a deep-atmospheric\nsource.\nThe purpose of this paper is to use updated information on the kinetics of nitrogen species to reevaluate both the quenched chemistry (deep atmospheric source)\nand photochemistry (coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry) hypotheses for the production\nof HCN on Jupiter. We use two different one-dimensional (1D) kinetic-transport numerical models for this investigation. Both are based on the Caltech/JPL KINETICS\ncode,43 which uses finite-difference techniques to solve the 1D continuity equations. The\nfirst model considers photochemical kinetics and molecular and eddy diffusion, and we\napply that model to the stratosphere and upper troposphere of Jupiter. The second\nmodel considers thermochemical kinetics and eddy diffusion, and we apply that model\nto the deep Jovian troposphere. Previous investigators who have looked in detail at the\npossibility of HCN transport from the deep troposphere44,20,21 have used time-constant\narguments rather than full kinetic-transport models to predict the quenched HCN abundance in the upper troposphere. Recent suggested improvements to the time-constant\narguments45\u221248 have prompted us to reevaluate the thermochemical kinetics and quenching of the C-H-O system on Jupiter.49 Our success at modeling the transition from\nthermochemical equilibrium to transport-induced quenching in that C-H-O system has\nled us to investigate nitrogen species thermochemistry and quenching for this study.\n\n2. Nitrogen species kinetics\nThe full reaction list for our Jovian photochemical model includes 145 species\nand 1973 reactions. The H-C-O reactions are discussed elsewhere.49,50 The kinetics of\ncarbon-hydrogen-oxygen species has been well studied because of numerous combustionchemistry applications51\u221254 and terrestrial atmospheric-chemistry applications;55\u221259 however, less information is available for reactions of nitrogen-bearing species, particularly\nin reducing environments. Some relevant experimental data are discussed in the above\n\n\f6\ndata compilations51\u221259 and in numerous individual rate-coefficient studies. However,\nfor our application, laboratory data must be supplemented by theory - both quantum\nchemistry and master-equation calculations - for many reactions of importance in our\nmodels. We therefore rely heavily on the theoretical calculations of Dean and Bozzelli60\nfor the generation of our reaction mechanism. Several other investigations have also\nbeen useful for identifying important reactions and rate coefficients.61\u221265 Our adopted\nreaction-rate coefficients are included in the full photochemical model output available\nin the Supplementary material.\nWe consider the kinetics of H2 , H, and 58 oxygen- and carbon-bearing species,49,50\nas well as N, N2 , NH, NH2 , NH3 , NNH, N2 H2 , H2 NN, N2 H3 , N2 H4 , CN, HCN, H2 CN,\nCH2 NH, CH3 NH, CH2 NH2 , CH3 NH2 CH2 CN, CH3 CN, C3 N, HC3 N, C2 H2 CN, C2 H3 CN,\nNO, NO2 , N2 O, HNO, HNO2 , NCO, HNCO, CH3 NO, PN, and NH2 PH2 in both our\nthermochemical and photochemical models. We also include several other phosphorusbearing species, but a full discussion of the phosphorus kinetics and NH3 -PH3 photochemical coupling is deferred to a later paper (see also66,67 ). We initially included HNC,\nC2 N, and C2 N2 in the models, but these species were produced in trivial amounts in the\nphotochemical models and had little effect on the kinetics of other constituents, so we\ndropped them from consideration. For our photochemical model, we also include C2 H4 N\n(i.e., CH2 =CH\u1e44H, CH3 \u010a=NH, and/or CH3 CH=N* isomers), C2 H5 N (i.e., CH2 =CHNH2\nand CH3 CH=NH isomers), C2 H5 \u1e44H, C2 H5 NH2 , CH3 CH=NNH2 , CH3 CH=NC2 H5 , and\nCH3 CH=NN=CHCH3 based on laboratory photolysis investigations.36\u221239 However, we\nomit these latter species from our deep-tropospheric thermochemical model due to a\nlack of information on their thermodynamic parameters - information that is needed\nto fully reverse the kinetic reactions through the principle of microscopic reversibility.\nAlthough these species are unlikely to be significant constituents in the deep troposphere of Jupiter, they are potentially important photochemical products of coupled\nNH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry, as well as precursors to HCN formation in Jupiter's upper\ntroposphere,36\u221239 and must be included in the photochemical model.\nMany of our reaction rate coefficients derive from Dean and Bozzelli,60 who validate their proposed mechanism by comparing their model predictions with experimental\nresults from several flame studies. The expressions provided for their individual reaction rate coefficients are valid for temperatures in the range of 600-2500 K. Those\ntemperatures are appropriate for our deep-tropospheric thermochemical modeling but\nnot for conditions in Jupiter's upper troposphere and stratosphere, where temperatures\n\n\f7\n68\u221271\ncan drop to <\nTherefore, although we generally adopt\n\u223c 110 K at the tropopause.\nthe Dean and Bozzelli expressions as given in their paper,60 we check for pathological or\n\ninconsistent behavior at low temperatures and alter the expressions, as necessary. Some\nof the Dean and Bozzelli rate coefficients have also been replaced due to the availability of experimentally derived rate coefficients or due to inappropriate rate coefficients\ncalculated for the reverse reaction (i.e., those in excess of kinetic collision-rate considerations). Moreover, the Dean and Bozzelli60 mechanism does not cover the full suite\nof nitriles, amines, hydrazones, and other complex nitrogen-bearing organics that are\nexpected to form in coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry.36\u221239 Some important rate coefficients for the production and loss of these organo-nitrogen compounds could be found\nin the literature, but many could not. We therefore apply our reaction list to simulations of laboratory photolysis investigations to help constrain uncertain reaction rate\ncoefficients and to test our overall mechanism.\nThe first such simulation we perform is for the photolysis of pure ammonia, as\ndescribed in Groth et al.72 In this experiment, 37.5 torr of pure ammonia at room\ntemperature is introduced to a cylindrical quartz cell 10-cm long and 5.5 cm in diameter\nand irradiated by 206.2-nm photons from an iodine lamp.72 The resulting photolysis\nproduct quantum yields are derived as a function of photons absorbed. To simulate this\ninvestigation, we use the KINETICS code43 with our reaction list described above and\napply it to a 1D \"box\" of the appropriate length (10 cm), with the appropriate 298 K,\n37.5-torr NH3 initial conditions. Since the NH3 photolysis rate has a gradient within\nthe cell under these conditions, we divide our box into a 21-segment grid. We assume a\nlamp flux at 206.2 nm at the front of our cell of 3 \u00d7 1014 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , although\nexact knowledge of the lamp flux is not necessary because the experimental results were\nreported in terms of quantum yields per quanta absorbed.72 After 1.03 \u00d7 1019 photons\nabsorbed, Groth et al.72 find quantum yields for N2 , H2 , and N2 H4 production of 0.163,\n0.490, 0.0005, respectively. From our box-model simulations, we derive quantum yields\nof 0.162, 0.487, and 0.00115 for N2 , H2 , and N2 H4 , respectively, at a corresponding\nnumber of photons absorbed. As with the Groth et al. experiment72 , we find that the\nquantum yields of H2 and N2 level off after an initial rise, whereas the N2 H4 quantum\nyield goes through an early maximum, followed by a drop off to low values. The results of\nour simulation are insensitive to reasonable assumptions about the diffusion coefficients\nwithin the cylinder or the lamp flux.\nThe photolysis of ammonia at 206.2 nm occurs exclusively through the NH3 +\n\n\f8\nh\u03bd \u2192 NH2 (X\u0303 2 B1 ) + H pathway.72 Hydrazine production and loss depends critically on\nthese photolysis products, a fact that can explain the observed quantum-yield behavior\nof the N2 H4 . Hydrazine is produced in our model mainly from the termolecular reaction\n2 NH2 + M \u2192 N2 H4 + M, where M is any third body, and the dominant two loss\nprocesses (of roughly equal importance at later times) are H + N2 H4 \u2192 N2 H3 + H2 and\n\nNH2 + N2 H4 \u2192 N2 H3 + NH3 . When NH2 is released from NH3 photolysis, hydrazine is\nreadily synthesized and continues to increase in concentration until enough N2 H4 , NH2 ,\nand H is built up that loss processes can compete. At that point, the N2 H4 reaches a\nconstant concentration (i.e., it is in steady state), while N2 and H2 production continues\n\nthrough the net equation 2 NH3 \u2192 N2 + 3H2 , which goes through N2 H4 and other N2 Hx\nspecies as intermediates. For example, the dominant pathway for N2 and H2 production\nin our simulation is the following scheme:\n3 ( NH3 + h\u03bd \u2212\u2192 NH2 + H )\n\nCheng et al.73\n\n2 NH2 + M \u2212\u2192 N2 H4 + M\n\nFagerstrom et al.74\n\nNH2 + N2 H3 \u2212\u2192 NH3 + H2 NN\n\nDean and Bozzelli60\n\nN2 H4 + H \u2212\u2192 N2 H3 + H2\n\nH2 NN + H \u2212\u2192 NNH + H2\nNNH \u2212\u2192 N2 + H\n\n2 H + M \u2212\u2192 H2 + M\n\nVaghjiani75\nDean and Bozzelli60\nDean and Bozzelli60\nBaulch et al.52\n\nNet : 2 NH3 \u2212\u2192 N2 + 3 H2 ,\nwhere the reference at the end of each reaction represents the source of the rate coefficient or photolysis cross section. Note the importance of N2 Hx intermediate species in\nthis scheme (see also76 ); these species are also likely to be important in the kinetics of\nnitrogen species under combustion-chemistry conditions60 and Jovian tropospheric conditions. Reactions involving H2 NN, a singlet biradical, are speculative at this point, but\nH2 NN is expected to be a major product of the NH2 + NH2 reaction under combustionchemistry conditions.60 We strictly follow the Dean and Bozzelli theoretically derived\nrate coefficients60 for the production and loss of this species and find that it can contribute to the conversion of NH3 to N2 under low-temperature NH3 photolysis conditions.\nA main secondary scheme in our simulation involves the NH2 + N2 H4 \u2192 NH3\n\n+ N2 H3 abstraction reaction. Dean and Bozzelli60 use a \"Direct Hydrogen Transfer\"\n(DHT) method to derive a rate coefficient of 6.1 \u00d7 10\u221218 T 1.94 exp(\u2212820/T ) cm3 s\u22121 (for\n\n\f9\nT in K) for this reaction, which if extrapolated to 300 K would produce a value of\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm3 s\u22121 . In contrast, experimental data have been used to estimate a 300-K\n\nrate coefficient of 5 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 for this reaction77 - a value about 20 times larger\nthan that derived theoretically.60 We find that we get the best agreement with the Groth\net al. experimentally derived N2 and H2 quantum yields72 if we adopt a value that lies\n\nin between the experimental77 and theoretical60 values, i.e., if we adopt a rate coefficient\nof 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221217 T 1.94 exp(\u2212820/T ) cm3 s\u22121 for this reaction (seven times the Dean and\nBozzelli60 expression). We use this expression throughout our subsequent modeling.\nAlthough our modeled quantum yields (and their time variation) for N2 and H2\n\nare in excellent agreement with experimental results,72 our quantum yields for N2 H4 do\nnot exactly match the experiments. Our N2 H4 quantum yield goes through a maximum\nat slightly earlier times (albeit at a similar peak magnitude of \u223c0.03-0.04) and falls off\nmore quickly initially than was observed,72 then more slowly at later times. Moreover,\nour N2 H4 concentration reaches a steady state (with a quantum yield that therefore\nlinearly decreases with photons absorbed), whereas the N2 H4 concentration in the experiments apparently decreases after an early maximum before possibly reaching a low\nconstant value (see Fig. 1 in Groth et al.72 ). Photolysis of N2 H4 is included in our model,\nand although occurring, the N2 H4 loss due to photolysis cannot compete with abstraction by hydrogen atoms and NH2 . It is unclear what the additional loss process might be.\nDespite this slight quantitative inconsistency with the N2 H4 behavior, we have chosen\nnot to tweak the reaction rate coefficients any further, as the dominant reactions (except\nfor the one for NH2 + N2 H4 , which we modified) all have literature-derived values. Keep\nin mind, however, that our mechanism may slightly overpredict the net production of\nN2 H4 under these conditions.\nThe second simulation we perform is the investigation of the photochemical coupling of ammonia (NH3 ) and acetylene (C2 H2 ) in the presence of H2 .35\u221239 As has been\ndiscussed in detail in these investigations, several complex organo-nitrogen compounds\nare produced when H2 -NH3 -C2 H2 mixtures are irradiated by 184.9-nm and 206.2-nm\nphotons. The rate coefficients for the production and loss of these compounds are generally not available in the literature. We therefore simulate the conditions in the Keane et\nal. experiments39 and compare models to experimental results in order to help constrain\nthe relevant kinetics.\nThe specific experiment we simulate is the irradiation of a mixture of 600 torr\nH2 , 40 torr NH3 , and 5 torr C2 H2 at 296 K by 206.2-nm ultraviolet photons. Keane et\n\n\f10\nal.39 present quantum yields resulting from that investigation; however, we utilize more\ndetailed information on this experiment, including the time variation of the photoproducts, from the thesis and laboratory notebooks of T. C. Keane.38 During the experiment,\nquartz cells of 2.5-cm diameter and 10-cm length were filled with the above gas mixture,\nand an iodine lamp was used to irradiate the cell with 206.2 nm photons for various\nlengths of time. Ammonia actinometry76 was used to determine that 4.438 \u00d7 1015 photons per second were entering the cell, for a corresponding 206.2-nm flux of 9.04 \u00d7 1014\n\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The composition and abundance of the photoproducts were measured by 500 MHz NMR spectroscopy, and full details of the experimental and analysis\nprocedure can be found in the original reports.38,39\nWe use KINETICS43 to simulate this experiment in a similar manner as for the\npure ammonia photolysis experiment.72 We start with a one-dimensional 10-cm box\n(subdivided into a six-segment grid) filled with the appropriate 600/40/5 torr mix of\nH2 /NH3 /C2 H2 irradiated by a 206.2-nm flux of 9.04 \u00d7 1014 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and use\nthe KINETICS model with our full 1973-reaction list to solve for the time variation in\nthe abundances of carbon-, nitrogen-, and hydrogen-bearing species. Our model results\nare compared with the experimental results38 in Fig. 1.\nThe dominant nitrogen-bearing products in our model are N2 (not investigated\nby Keane 1995), acetaldazine (CH3 CH=N-N=CHCH3 ), ethylamine (C2 H5 NH2 ), and N ethylethylideneimine (CH3 CH=NC2 H5 ), with lesser amounts of the other species shown\nin Fig. 1. Almost no quantitative kinetic information exists for these species. Kaye and\nStrobel35 , Ferris and Ishikawa37 , and Keane38 all propose that the critical first step in\nthe coupled photochemistry of NH3 -C2 H2 is the sequence NH3 + h\u03bd \u2192 NH2 + H and\nC2 H2 + H + M \u2192 C2 H3 + M, followed by NH2 + C2 H3 + M \u2192 C2 H5 N + M. However,\n\nthe identity and fate of the C2 H5 N isomer, and the resulting production sequences for\nthe different complex organo-nitrogen species differ between these investigations. Kaye\nand Strobel35 do not attempt to distinguish the main C2 H5 N isomer, although they do\nnote that aziridine, a cyclic C2 H5 N isomer, is known to yield HCN upon photolysis,78\n\nand they suggest that the other isomers would, as well. Kaye and Strobel35 stop their\nmechanism at the C2 H5 N photolysis stage and do not further investigate the production\nof complex nitrogen-bearing organics. Ferris and Ishikawa37 and Keane38 suggest that\nvinylamine (C2 H3 NH2 ) is formed initially, followed by isomerization to ethylideneimine\n(CH3 CH=NH), a process that is common with enamines.79\u221281 Keane38 goes on to propose that the key to the formation of HCN, as well as some of the complex species is the\n\n\f11\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nFIGURE 1.

The dotted lines and\nopen triangles correspond to the model results, whereas the solid squares correspond\nto the experimental results.38 Note the change in the ordinate range for the different\nspecies. Reported measurement errors are 10-15% on species abundances, mostly due\nto the NMR technique.38\nethylideneiminyl radical (CH3 CH=N*), which can react with itself to form acetaldazine,\nor thermally decompose (or photolyze) to form HCN or CH3 CN. Although we do not\nexplicitly distinguish between C2 H5 N and C2 H4 N isomers in our model, our reaction\nlist implicitly follows the main CH3 CH=NH and CH3 CH=N* pathways suggested by\nKeane.38 However, some of our production mechanisms for the complex species diverge\nfrom those suggested by the earlier investigations.37,38\nAs an example, the dominant acetaldazine (see Fig. 1h) formation mechanism\nin our model is 2 C2 H4 N + M \u2192 CH3 CH=NN=CHCH3 , as suggested by Keane38 and\n\n\f12\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nh\n\nFIGURE 1. (cont.)\nFerris et al.,37 where their expected C2 H4 isomer is CH3 CH=N*. However, the main nonrecycling production pathway for C2 H4 N in our model is the reaction C2 H2 + NH2 + M\n\u2192 C2 H4 N + M, followed very closely in terms of importance by hydrogen abstraction\nfrom C2 H5 N by both H and NH2 , whereas only the H-atom abstraction pathway C2 H5 N\n(i.e., as CH3 CH=NH) + H \u2192 C2 H4 N + H2 is considered in the earlier investigations.37,38\n\nNote that the C2 H2 + NH2 + M reaction has been studied experimentally82\u221285 and\ntheoretically,86 and we adopt a rate coefficient for this reaction of k0 \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u221226 cm6\n\ns\u22121 and k\u221e = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221219 T 2.03 exp(\u22121300/T ) cm3 s\u22121 , where T is the temperature in\nkelvins. Photolysis of acetaldazine helps recycle C2 H4 N in our model and is the main\neffective loss process of acetaldazine.\nEthylamine (Fig. 1e) is produced in our model through the reaction NH2 + C2 H5\n+ M \u2192 C2 H5 NH2 + M, with loss due to photolysis and abstraction by H atoms to\n\n\f13\nform C2 H5 \u1e44H. These pathways are consistent with previous suggestions.38 Although\nthe rate coefficient for the reaction of C2 H5 with NH2 has been measured,87 the relative\nroles of addition and disproportionation are not clear, and the assumed relative rates of\nthe different product pathways for this reaction can affect our results. To prevent large\nquantities of ethylamine from building up in our cell, we have assumed that NH2 +\nC2 H5 \u2192 NH3 + C2 H4 is about three times faster than NH2 + C2 H5 \u2192 C2 H5 NH2 . This\nfactor-of-three value may be a overestimate, as can be seen from the fact that we slightly\nunderestimate the ethylamine abundance shown in Fig. 1e. A thorough discussion of\nthe photolysis of ethylamine can be found elsewhere.38\nKeane38 suggests that N -ethylethylideneimine (Fig. 1g) is produced through the\nnucleophilic addition/elimination reaction CH3 CH=NH + C2 H5 NH2 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-\n\nC2 H5 + NH3 . However, this reaction may have a significant activation energy barrier in the gas phase, given that the reactants are molecules and not radicals. We\ninstead suggest that CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 formation might occur through reactions such as\n(1) CH3 CH=N* + C2 H5 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 , (2) C2 H5 N + C2 H5 \u1e44H \u2192 CH3 CH=NC2 H5 + NH2 , (3) CH3 CH=N* + C2 H6 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 + H, (4) CH3 CH=N*\n+ C2 H5 NH2 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 + NH2 , (5) C2 H5 \u1e44H + C2 H5 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-C2 H5\n\n+ H2 , (6) C2 H5 N + C2 H5 \u2192 CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 + H, or (7) C2 H5 NH2 + C2 H3 \u2192\nCH3 CH=N-C2 H5 + H. Without thermodynamic parameters for N -ethylethylideneimine\nand some of these other species, the exothermicity and likely activation energies of these\nreactions cannot be determined. In our model, the first of our suggested reactions dominates N -ethylethylideneimine production, but other potential pathways are also included\nin the model; see the Supplementary material for our estimates of these reaction rate\ncoefficients. N -ethylethylideneimine is destroyed in our model predominantly through\nreactions with H (to form either CH3 CH=N* + C2 H6 or C2 H5 N + C2 H5 ) and with\nCH3 CH=N* (to form acetaldazine + C2 H5 ). The production and loss mechanisms for\nN -ethylethylideneimine remain considerably uncertain. In particular, given the rapid\nobserved rate of the gas-phase reaction of CH3 CHO and N2 H4 to form CH3 CH=NNH2 and other products,38 it is possible that CH3 CH=NH participates in nucleophilic\naddition/elimination reactions without much of an energy barrier in the gas phase, as\noriginally proposed by Keane.38\nAcetaldehyde hydrazone exhibits interesting behavior in Keane's experimental\ndata (see Fig. 1f). At room temperature, the CH3 CH=NNH2 abundance is negligible\nuntil irradiation times of 15 minutes or longer, at which point it jumps up to become\n\n\f14\na major product of coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry. The reason for this late production is unclear, and the model does not reproduce this behavior. One possibility\nis that slow photolysis of one of the more abundant photoproducts such as C2 H5 NH2 ,\nCH3 CH=NC2 H5 , or CH3 CH=NN=CHCH3 contributes, but the profiles of these species\nshow no evidence for a sudden, significant loss at late times. Atomic hydrogen begins to\nbuild up in our model at later times as more and more of the C2 H2 is destroyed, and a\nsecond possibility is that hydrogen abstraction commences as a significant loss process\nfor some of our species as H atoms build up in the cell, with a corresponding significant\nincrease in the production rate for CH3 CH=NNH2 . However, again, there are no signs\nof the corresponding reduction of any of the other observed species, and we are unable to\nfind a combination of reactions that would reproduce this behavior. The late production\nof acetaldehyde hydrazone remains a mystery. In our model, CH3 CH=NNH2 is produced\npredominantly through the addition reactions NH2 + C2 H4 N \u2192 CH3 CH=NNH2 and\n\nH2 NN + C2 H4 \u2192 CH3 CH=NNH2 and is lost mainly through H + CH3 CH=NNH2 \u2192\nNH2 + C2 H5 N, but given our poor comparisons with the experimental data,38 we have\n\nno confidence in our adopted kinetics for CH3 CH=NNH2 .\nKinetic information for some of the simpler species like HCN, CH3 CN, and\nCH3 NH2 exists in the literature, but that does not mean the production and loss of\nthese species under the Keane38 experimental conditions are well understood. Methylamine (Fig. 1c) is produced in our model largely from NH2 + CH3 + M \u2192 CH3 NH2 +\nM, for which rate-coefficient information is available.88 Photolysis dominates the loss\nof CH3 NH2 , a process that has been well studied.89\u221293 Acetonitrile (Fig. 1d) has four\nmain production mechanisms in our model, all involving Keane's key intermediate, the\nCH3 CH=N* radical.38 In order of decreasing importance, these are (1) 2CH3 CH=N*\n\u2192 CH3 CN + C2 H5 N, (2) CH3 CH=N* + C2 H5 \u2192 CH3 CN + C2 H6 , (3) CH3 CH=N* +\nH \u2192 CH3 CN + H2 , and (4) CH3 CH=N* + NH2 \u2192 CH3 CN + NH3 , for which there\n\nare no literature values for rate coefficients. In our model, CH3 CN is destroyed largely\nthrough the abstraction reactions CH3 CN + CH3 \u2192 CH2 CN + CH4 and CH3 CN + H\n\u2192 CH2 CN + H2 , as well as through CH3 CN + H \u2192 HCN + CH3 . Rate coefficients for\nthe two reactions of H with CH3 CN have been reported.63 The reaction CH3 CN + CH3\n\n\u2192 CH2 CN + CH4 is exothermic under our conditions but likely possesses a significant\nactivation barrier. We estimate a rate coefficient of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 exp(\u22123000/T ) (for T in\nK) for this reaction, based in part on analogy with H + CH3 CN.\nHydrogen cyanide (Fig. 1b) is produced in multiple ways under the conditions of\n\n\f15\nthis experiment, including from photolysis of many of the above species.38 Due to the\nrapid synthesis of C2 H4 N and H radicals with our proposed mechanism, the dominant\nproduction pathway in our model is the speculative reaction C2 H4 N + H \u2192 HCN +\n\nCH4 . This reaction is likely to be highly exothermic; however, other product pathways\nmay compete, including formation of the C2 H5 N adduct, formation of CH3 CN + H2 ,\nand, less likely because of the amount of rearrangement involved and the necessity of\nbreaking the strong C=N bond, the formation of NH3 + C2 H2 . We have adopted a\nrate coefficient of 4 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm3 s\u22121 for the C2 H4 N + H \u2192 HCN + CH4 reaction.\nOther significant production mechanisms in our model involve H2 CN, either through\nself reaction,94 reaction with H,95 or reaction with NH2 .60 Hydrogen cyanide is lost\nmainly through the reaction HCN + C2 H3 \u2192 C2 H3 CN + H.96\n\nThe acrylonitrile (C2 H3 CN, not shown in Fig. 1) that forms in the latter reaction\nalso builds up in the cell in our simulation, for an overall abundance that lies in between\nthat of acetonitrile and ethylamine. Keane38 finds no evidence for acrylonitrile in the\nNMR spectra, although he does note that a liquid polymer forms on the window of the\ncell during the photolysis experiment. It is possible that the C2 H3 CN polymerizes or that\nwe have neglected some other significant loss process for this molecule. The dominant\nloss mechanism currently in our model is the reverse of the production reaction, i.e.,\nC2 H3 CN + H \u2192 HCN + C2 H3 .\n\nTwo other species that form in noticeable quantities in our model but are not\ndetected by Keane38 are methanimine (CH2 NH), whose concentration reaches a peak\nvalue of 5.8 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 after 21 minutes before slowly dropping off with time, and\n\nC2 H5 N, whose concentration peaks at 4.6 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 after 15 minutes before slowly\ndropping off with time. Methanimine is produced in our model mainly from reaction\nof H2 CN with C2 H3 and C2 H5 radicals and is lost from abstraction by C2 H3 to form\nH2 CN + C2 H4 . Because of its suspected importance in their overall reaction mechanism,\nKeane38 searched specifically for a signature that could be caused by the C2 H5 N isomer\nethanimine (CH3 CH=NH), as well as attempted to synthesize and isolate this imine,\nbut both attempts were unsuccessful. The primary production mechanism for forming\nC2 H5 N in our model, and indeed one of the top three mechanisms for forming the C-N\nbond in our simulation, is the reaction originally proposed by Kaye and Strobel:35 NH2\n+ C2 H3 + M \u2192 C2 H5 N + M. Reaction of CH3 CH=NNH2 with H to form C2 H5 N + NH2\n\ncontributes at later times. The primary loss processes for C2 H5 N in our model include\nabstraction by H or NH2 to form C2 H4 N and H2 or NH3 , and reaction with C2 H5 \u1e44H\n\n\f16\nM\n\nto form CH3 CH=N-C2 H5 + NH2 . Aside from the C2 H3 + NH2 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 N reaction\nproposed earlier,35 the two other key reactions leading to the formation of the C-N bond\nM\n\nM\n\nin our model are NH2 + C2 H2 \u2212\u2192 C2 H4 N and NH2 + C2 H5 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 NH2 (see above).\n\nKeane38 does not track the time dependence of the N2 H4 abundance in their\nexperiment. However, a quantum yield is reported39 for N2 H4 formation of 0.007 from\n\nthe first few minutes of the irradiation (further details are not specified). We obtain\nthat N2 H4 quantum yield after 7 minutes in our model.\nAlthough our model results compare well with the time variation observed for\nmany of the species in the Keane38 experiment (see Fig. 1), problems do exist, especially\nfor CH3 CH=NNH2 (Fig. 1f), and to a lesser extent for CH3 CH=NN=CHCH3 (Fig. 1h).\nThe actual mechanism involved is likely far more complex than our limited reaction\nlist can attempt to reproduce, but without further information on the thermodynamic\nproperties of the key species and on the rate coefficients for individual reactions, we are\nunlikely to implement meaningful improvements to the proposed mechanism. Despite\nthe incomplete and cursory nature of the proposed mechanism, we at least now have\nin place a reaction list that includes estimates for the production and loss of the major\nspecies involved in the coupled chemistry of C2 H2 -NH2 -H2 mixtures, and we can test\nthe effectiveness of coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry under Jovian conditions. We\ncan test, in particular, whether the addition of these various complex nitrogen-bearing\nspecies contributes to the formation of HCN on Jupiter.\n\n3. Photochemical model\nThe photochemistry of ammonia on Jupiter was first investigated qualitatively\nby Wildt97 and quantitatively by Cadle98 and McNesby;99 the latter two authors both\ndiscussed the likelihood of carbon-nitrogen coupling. Strobel100 was the first to develop\na realistic model that explained the continuing presence of NH3 on Jupiter, through a\nnitrogen cycle in which convection allows photochemical products like N2 H4 to be transported to deeper, hotter levels of the troposphere, where they can be converted back into\nNH3 . Strobel100 suggested that slow vertical mixing above the ammonia clouds, combined with efficient NH3 photolysis and N2 H4 production, would limit the abundance\nof NH3 in Jupiter's stratosphere and thus inhibit carbon-nitrogen coupling; he was also\nthe first to suggest that condensed N2 H4 could be a major component of the Jovian\nupper tropospheric and lower stratospheric haze. Atreya et al.101 further refined these\n\n\f17\nearlier models and considered the possible effects of hydrazine supersaturation on the\ndistribution of nitrogen-bearing species, Kuhn et al.29 examined CH4 -NH3 coupled photochemistry through the production of methylamine, and Strobel102 examined NH3 -PH3\nphotochemical coupling. Kaye and Strobel34 refuted the suggestion29 that methylamine\nproduction would be significant on Jupiter and demonstrated that CH3 NH2 and HCN\nproduction would be greatly inhibited even if the catalytic destruction of CH4 through\nC2 H2 photolysis products were included in the model. Kaye and Strobel35 suggested\ninstead that coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry could lead to the production of HCN\nand other carbon-nitrogen species on Jupiter.\nAfter the seminal works of Kaye and Strobel,34,35,66,67 there was a hiatus in Jovian tropospheric photochemical modeling until observations became advanced enough\nto provide constraints on the vertical and horizontal profiles of ammonia and other tropospheric species. The first to exploit these advances were Edgington et al.,103,104 who\ncreated a photochemical model to investigate the latitude and altitude variation of ammonia and phosphine from ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope observations. However,\nthe Edgington et al. models were based on the earlier models101,105 that did not include\nthe coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry suggested by theoretical35 and experimental36\u221239\nstudies. The models we develop for this paper represent the first attempt to include\nthe photochemical production of the complex organo-nitrogen species observed in these\nNH3 -C2 H2 photolysis experiments. Advances in our knowledge of the vertical distribution of temperatures, stratospheric hydrocarbons, and tropospheric constituents on\nJupiter106,107 greatly aid our current investigation. Details concerning the photochemical\nmodel and our assumptions and inputs to that model are described below.\n3.1 Photochemical model inputs\nOur photochemical model is designed to represent global-average conditions on\nJupiter. We adopt a temperature profile for the upper troposphere and middle atmosphere as described by Moses et al.50 The temperature profile at pressures less than\n0.001 mbar derives from the Galileo probe ASI data,69 whereas the profile at pressures\ngreater than 1 mbar derives largely from global-average Infrared Space Observatory\nobservations;70 in between these pressure regions, a roughly isothermal atmosphere is\nassumed. The model extends from 6.7 bar to 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 mbar, in a grid of 111 pressure\nlevels, with a vertical resolution of at least three levels per atmospheric scale height.\nThis extensive vertical range allows us to encompass not only the NH3 photolysis region\n\n\f18\nin the upper troposphere, but the methane photolysis region in the upper stratosphere.\nLow-to-average solar ultraviolet flux values are adopted,50 and Jupiter's orbital distance\nis fixed at 5.2 AU from the Sun. As with the model described in Section 2, our reaction\nlist contains 145 C-H-O-N-P species and 1973 reactions. Diurnally averaged quantities are considered, and we run the model until steady-state conditions are achieved.\nCondensation of NH3 , N2 H4 , P2 H4 , HCN, CH3 CN, and H2 O (the latter from external\nsources) are included in a manner described elsewhere.108 Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) and\nthe tropospheric water and NH4 SH clouds, with their potential effects on ammonia and\nother constituents,107,109 are not considered.\nAt the lower boundary of the model, we assume a He mole fraction of 0.136,110,111\na CH4 mole fraction of 2.04 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,112 a CO mole fraction of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 ,48 a PH3 mole\n\nfraction of 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,113 and an NH3 mole fraction of either 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,114 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,115,116 or\n5.72 \u00d7 10\u22124 .112 The three values for the bottom NH3 boundary condition were chosen to\n\nreflect the differences between the Jovian belt regions, for which NH3 is apparently dynamically depleted at the few-bar level, and zone regions, for which NH3 might achieve\n\nits deep, well-mixed value at the few-bar level.107,109,112,115,117\u2212118 All other species are\nassumed to have a zero concentration gradient at the lower boundary such that the\nspecies are transported through the lower boundary at a maximum possible rate. Zero\nflux boundary conditions are adopted at the upper boundary for all species except H,\nH2 O, CO, and CO2 . Atomic hydrogen, which is produced in the thermosphere, is assumed to have a downward flux of 8.0 \u00d7 108 atoms cm\u22122 s\u22121 at the top boundary.50 We\n\nalso assume that H2 O, CO, and CO2 from external sources are entering at the top of the\n\natmosphere with fluxes of, respectively, 4 \u00d7 104 , 1 \u00d7 106 , and 1 \u00d7 104 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .8,48,50,119\nBoth eddy and molecular diffusion are considered in the transport terms of\nthe continuity equations. Our adopted molecular diffusion coefficients are described\nelsewhere.120 In 1D models, the \"eddy\" diffusion coefficient Kzz provides a convenient\nmeans by which to parameterize vertical motions of all scales in the atmosphere. The\nstratospheric values for Kzz are taken from Moses et al.,50 who provide a full discussion\nof the various observations that were used to help constrain the eddy-diffusion-coefficient\nprofile. All these observational constraints have model dependencies that are difficult\nto characterize quantitatively. Near the methane homopause region in the upper stratosphere, Kzz is constrained from observations of the methane density profile from spacecraft ultraviolet occultation observations,121,122 from ground-based near-infrared stellar\noccultation observations,123 and from ultraviolet airglow observations of the 121.6-nm\n\n\f19\nH Lyman \u03b1 line emission and the 58.4-nm He line emission.124,125 In the middle stratosphere, near the few tenths of a millibar level, Kzz is constrained from observations of\nthe evolution of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 vapor deposited during the plume splashback\nphase of the impacts.5,8,119 In the lower stratosphere (\u223c1-100 mbar), Kzz is constrained\nfrom mid-infrared ethane observations.50 The minimum value of Kzz \u2248 300-1500 cm2 s\u22121\n\nin the upper troposphere derives from CO observations48 (see also the inferences from\ninfrared and ultraviolet observations of PH3 and NH3 103,104,126\u2212128 ). This minimum\nvalue affects the profiles of the species that have a production source at high altitudes;\na low value (i.e., a stagnant lower stratosphere) allows a greater build up of the column\nabundance of photochemically stable species like CO and C2 H6 in the stratosphere.129\nDue to the numerous observational constraints on stratospheric Kzz values, we keep\nour stratospheric Kzz profile fixed but allow the tropospheric value to vary as a free\nparameter.\nTropospheric Kzz values are difficult to constrain by remote-sensing observations.\nWithin and below the water clouds, convective motions are expected to result in high\neffective eddy diffusion coefficients of order Kzz \u2248 108 -109 cm2 s\u22121 .130 However, when radiative processes become important and the temperature profile ceases to become purely\nconvective (i.e., in the upper troposphere above the clouds), vertical mixing is expected\nto be reduced. The PH3 and NH3 vertical profiles derived from infrared and ultraviolet\nobservations have been used in this region, usually in combination with photochemistry\nor diffusion models, to constrain Kzz in the upper troposphere, although the results are\nvery model dependent.103,104,126,128 Moreover, these observations demonstrate that the\nPH3 and NH3 profiles, and the resulting Kzz inferences, vary with latitude, whereas we\nare attempting to construct a global-average model. As we will show, our results have\nsome sensitivity to the adopted tropospheric Kzz values: high values allow for rapid\nremoval of photochemically generated species into the deep troposphere. Based on Edgington et al.,104 we adopt a Kzz profile that varies slowly and linearly with pressure in\nthe troposphere with a value of \u223c1-2 \u00d7 104 cm2 s\u22121 between \u223c180 mbar and 1 bar, and\n\nwe test the sensitivity of the results to the tropospheric eddy diffusion coefficient by\nsimply multiplying this linear Kzz profile by a constant value.\n\nRayleigh scattering of H2 , He, and CH4 has been included in the model. Aerosol\nopacity in the 150-230 nm wavelength region can also influence our model results,\nthrough shielding of PH3 , NH3 , and other molecules from photolysis. West et al.131\nreview our current state of knowledge of the Jovian cloud and haze properties. Un-\n\n\f20\nfortunately, there appears to be little consensus regarding the details of the optical\nand physical properties and structure of the upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric\nclouds and hazes on Jupiter, as different groups, using different data sets and analysis\nprocedures, derive different results. Uniquely deriving these properties is difficult due\nto the large number of unknown parameters that can strongly affect the results, and\nthe problem is exacerbated by horizontal variations in these properties across Jupiter.\nBecause of a lack of reliable, detailed information on the aerosol properties in this wavelength region,103,104,132,133 we simplify the problem by including aerosol absorption only\nand neglect aerosol scattering. For our nominal model, we assume an optically thick\nhaze in the 300-700 mbar region with vertical optical depth 2.7 at 150-230 nm, presumed to be the NH3 cloud itself, and an optically thin haze in the 10-150 mbar region\nof vertical optical depth 0.14 (see West et al.,131 Sromovsky and Fry,134 and references\ntherein for further details and comparisons with other models). We test the sensitivity\nof these results to the assumed optical thickness of the 300-700 mbar haze. Fortunately,\ncondensation itself (and the saturation vapor pressure variation with temperature) has\nthe largest effect on the vertical profile of NH3 in the upper troposphere, and our results regarding the coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry are relatively insensitive to our\naerosol-opacity assumptions.\n3.2 Photochemical model results\nOur model results in terms of the mole-fraction profiles for several important\nnitrogen-bearing species in our nominal model are shown in Fig. 2. Also shown in the\nfigure is the C2 H2 profile derived from the model. Note that although C2 H2 is abundant\nin the stratosphere, its mole fraction is expected to fall off significantly with decreasing altitude because of reaction with atomic H, photolysis, and other photochemical loss\nprocesses. Our model atmosphere contains only 0.11 ppb of C2 H2 at the tropopause (140\nmbar). Similarly, the NH3 mole fraction in the tropopause region is also significantly\nreduced by condensation, photolysis, and other loss processes. Photochemical coupling\nof C2 H2 -NH3 is therefore greatly inhibited compared to static photolysis experiments38\ndescribed above, in which the initial mole fractions of NH3 and C2 H2 were 6.2% and\n0.775%. Some NH3 -C2 H2 coupling does occur, however, in our Jovian photochemical\nmodel, resulting in the production of small amounts of HCN, CH3 CN, C2 H5 NH2 , and\nthe other complex organo-nitrogen species seen in the photolysis experiments.36\u221239 Hydrogen cyanide is the dominant end product of this coupled chemistry, but its predicted\n\n\f21\n\nFIGURE 2.

The triple-dot-dashed profile represents CH2 NH,\nthe dotted profile represents CH3 CH=NH, and the dashed profile represents CH3 NH2 .\nThe acetylene profile is included for comparison; C2 H2 is relatively abundant in the\nstratosphere but its mole fraction falls off rapidly with decreasing altitude due to photochemical loss processes. Condensation is responsible for the sharp drop off in altitude\nof the NH3 and N2 H4 profiles in the few-hundred mbar range and the more localized\n\"bite-outs\" in the HCN and CH3 CN profiles between \u223c100-200 mbar.\nabundance is well below the observational upper limits.13\u221215 Our full photochemical\nmodel output, including species abundances, reaction rate coefficients, photolysis rates,\nproduction and loss rates, and chemical loss time scales can be found in the Supplementary material.\nBecause of the large amount of atomic H produced from NH3 photolysis in and\nabove the ammonia condensation region, the dominant scheme for producing HCN in\nour Jovian photochemical model is\nNH3 \u2212\u2192 NH2 + H\nh\u03bd\n\n\f22\nM\n\nH + C2 H2 \u2212\u2192 C2 H3\nM\n\nH + C2 H3 \u2212\u2192 C2 H4\nM\n\nH + C2 H4 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5\n\nH + C2 H5 \u2212\u2192 2 CH3\nM\n\nH + CH3 \u2212\u2192 CH4\nM\n\nNH2 + CH3 \u2212\u2192 CH3 NH2\n\nCH3 NH2 \u2212\u2192 CH3 NH + H\nh\u03bd\n\nH + CH3 NH \u2212\u2192 CH2 NH + H2\n\nCH2 NH \u2212\u2192 HCN + H2\nNet : NH3 + C2 H2 + 4 H \u2212\u2192 HCN + CH4 + + 2 H2 .\nh\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\nThe column-integrated rate of the NH2 + CH3 + M \u2212\u2192 CH3 NH2 + M reaction is\n\nabout an order of magnitude larger than the next most important reaction for producing\ncarbon-nitrogen bonds, that of NH2 + C2 H3 + M \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 N + M. This solution\n\ndiffers from theoretical models of Kaye and Strobel35 for which the NH2 + C2 H3 \u2192\nC2 H5 N reaction dominates, despite the fact that we use a slightly higher estimate for\n\nthe rate coefficient for this reaction. The main difference between our model and that\nof Kaye and Strobel35 in this regard appears to be the significance of CH3 production\nthrough sequential addition of atomic H to C2 Hx hydrocarbons (i.e., the first half of\nthe scheme (1) above). The sheer amount of H produced from NH3 photolysis (and\nfrom C2 H2 photolysis at higher altitudes) makes these three-body addition reactions\nfor atomic H effective (see also 135 ). Our solution here also differs from the results of\nour box-model simulations described in Section 2, for which the NH2 + C2 H2 + M \u2192\n\nC2 H4 N + M reaction dominates the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds, due to the\nlarge concentration of C2 H2 and relatively high pressure in the reaction cell.\n\nNone of the carbon-nitrogen species appear to be produced in our Jovian photochemical model in large enough quantities to be observable with current technologies.\nAfter HCN, the second and third most abundant carbon-nitrogen species produced in\nour Jovian photochemical model are C2 H5 NH2 and CH3 CN. The dominant mechanism\nfor producing CH3 CN in our model is\nNH3 \u2212\u2192 NH2 + H\nh\u03bd\nM\n\nH + C2 H2 \u2212\u2192 C2 H3\nM\n\nNH2 + C2 H3 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 N\n\n\f23\nC2 H5 N + H \u2212\u2192 C2 H4 N + H2\n\nC2 H4 N \u2212\u2192 CH3 CN + H\nNet : NH3 + C2 H2 \u2212\u2192 CH3 CN + H2 .\nNote that this mechanism was proposed as a way to form acetonitrile in coupled NH3 C2 H2 photolysis experiments.36\u221238\nThe dominant mechanism for producing C2 H5 NH2 in our model is\nNH3 \u2212\u2192 NH2 + H\nh\u03bd\nM\n\nH + C2 H2 \u2212\u2192 C2 H3\nM\n\nH + C2 H3 \u2212\u2192 C2 H4\nM\n\nH + C2 H4 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5\nM\n\nNH2 + C2 H5 \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 NH2\nNet : NH3 + C2 H2 + 2 H \u2212\u2192 C2 H5 NH2 .\nThis mechanism was proposed as being important for the production of ethylamine in\ncoupled NH3 -C2 H2 photolysis experiments.38\nFigure 3 shows the sensitivity of some of the species abundances to the tropospheric eddy diffusion coefficient and to the assumed haze optical depth in the ammonia\ncondensation region. A larger tropospheric eddy diffusion coefficient allows slightly more\nNH3 to be carried up into the stratosphere, where slightly more NH2 is formed as a result. The stratospheric abundances of species that depend on NH2 for their production,\nwhich includes all the carbon-nitrogen species, are then slightly increased for the case of\nthe larger Kzz , and stratospheric mole fractions are correspondingly increased. However,\nthe larger tropospheric Kzz also allows these species to diffuse more quickly through the\nbottom boundary of the model, so that the tropospheric mole fractions of species that are\nproduced from the stratospheric coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry are reduced when\nKzz is increased. The NH3 and N2 H4 abundances themselves are controlled by condensation and evaporation in the troposphere and show little sensitivity to tropospheric\nKzz values. Molecular nitrogen, on the other hand, does not condense and is produced\nlargely in the troposphere, so increasing the tropospheric Kzz leads to increased transport and loss through the lower boundary, resulting in a reduced N2 column abundance\nwhen tropospheric Kzz values are increased.\nThe dotted lines in Fig. 3 represent a model in which the eddy diffusion coefficient\nprofile is the same as that of our nominal model (solid lines), but in which the haze\n\n\f24\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ne\n\nFouchet et al. 115\nEdgington et al. 104\nLara et al.126\nEdgington et al. 103\nCarlson et al. 136\nGriffith et al. 137\nIrwin et al. 138\nde Pater et al. 109\n\nFolkner et al. 118\nGibson et al. 114\nBurgdorf et al. 139\nAchterberg et al. 140\nBetremieux et al. 133\nSromovsky et al. 117\n\nf\n\nFIGURE 3.

(cont.)\nvertical optical depth at 150-230 nm in the 300-700 mbar region is 8 instead of 2.7.\nThe larger optical depth leads to increased shielding of the NH3 , with a corresponding\nslight reduction in the NH2 production rate at the base of the NH3 cloud and a very\nslight increase in the NH3 mole fraction at the top of the cloud. This change in optical\ndepth in the 300-700 mbar pressure region has almost no effect on species abundances,\nexcept for that of N2 , whose production rate slightly drops. Similarly, changing the\nassumed NH3 mole fraction at the lower boundary (not shown in the figure) has almost\nno effect on the species abundances other than on NH3 itself below its condensation\nregion. Note that we have not included chemical loss processes in the model such as\nreaction of NH3 with H2 S or interaction with the NH4 SH cloud that would explain the\n\"stair step\" reduction behavior of the NH3 mole fraction in the 1-2 bar region implied\nby some of the observations.107,109\nThese simple sensitivity studies show that our main conclusion about the unimportance of coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry on Jupiter cannot be changed by tweak-\n\n\f26\ning uncertain free parameters in the model. The observed PH3 profile on Jupiter puts\nlimits on how small the tropospheric eddy diffusion coefficient can be,103,104,126,128 and\nour tropospheric Kzz is unlikely to be much smaller than we have adopted in our nominal model. The production rate of nitriles and other organo-nitrogen compounds is\nmostly unaffected by the assumed optical depth within the ammonia cloud layer or the\nassumed NH3 abundance below the cloud. Observations show NH3 to be subsaturated\non Jupiter, particularly in belt regions,107 whereas our ammonia profile closely follows its\nsaturation vapor pressure curve in its condensation region (in contrast to N2 H4 , which is\nproduced rapidly enough in its condensation region that condensation loss cannot keep\npace, and supersaturations are maintained). A subsaturated ammonia profile would lead\nto even less C2 H2 -NH3 photochemical coupling and lower abundances of HCN and other\ncarbon-nitrogen compounds.\nThe lack of coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry in our model is entirely due to\nthe low derived abundance of C2 H2 in the NH3 photolysis region in Jupiter's upper\ntroposphere and lower stratosphere. Kaye and Strobel35 assumed a much greater C2 H2\nabundance in their model - their Model A contains C2 H2 concentrations a factor of\n\u223c70 higher than our nominal model at their 50-km altitude upper boundary and more\nthan four orders of magnitude greater than our nominal model throughout the troposphere. That difference is the main cause of our different predictions concerning the\nHCN abundance on Jupiter. On the other hand, we confirm the models of Kaye and\nStrobel35 and Strobel100 in that coupled CH4 -NH3 photochemistry is greatly inhibited\ndue to the physical separation of the CH4 photolysis region in the upper stratosphere\nfrom the NH3 photolysis region in the troposphere. The only way we could increase\nthe net production rate of HCN in our model would be to invoke an upper tropospheric\nsource of C2 H2 24,25,132,133 or unusual dynamical conditions that allow rapid transport of\nstratospheric C2 H2 into the troposphere; we discuss these possibilities further in Section\n5.2.\n\n4. Thermochemical Kinetics and\nTransport Model for the Deep Troposphere\nAt very high temperatures (>\n\u223c1500 K) in Jupiter's deep troposphere, the atmospheric composition is controlled by thermochemical equilibrium. Equilibrium models\nthat include nitrogen species141\u2212143,19\u221221 show that NH3 is the dominant nitrogen-bearing\n\n\f27\nconstituent throughout the Jovian atmosphere; HCN and N2 are not very abundant at\ncolder high altitudes, but the equilibrium mole fractions of N2 and HCN are both expected to increase toward the deeper, hotter regions of the troposphere. For the observable regions in the upper troposphere, the equilibrium HCN abundance, in particular,\nis negligible. However, as was first discussed quantitatively by Prinn and Barshay,144\nthermochemical equilibrium may be difficult to maintain on Jupiter in the presence of\nrapid convective mixing. In this scenario, thermochemical equilibrium can be preserved\nonly as long as the chemical kinetic time scale for conversion between different molecular\nspecies is shorter than the time scale for vertical atmospheric mixing. As a parcel of\ngas from deeper, hotter levels is transported up to cooler atmospheric regions, it will\neventually encounter regions where the chemical kinetic conversion time scale becomes\nlonger than the transport time scale, at which point the mole fractions of species like\nCO, N2 , CH3 NH2 , or HCN can become \"quenched\" or \"frozen in\" due to the inability\nof the kinetic reactions to overcome activation energy barriers. At altitudes above that\nquenching level (i.e., at altitudes above the level where the chemical-kinetic time constant equals the convective mixing time constant), the mole fraction of the quenched\nspecies will remain fixed at the equilibrium abundances achieved at the quench point.144\nBecause of this transport-induced disequilibrium process, species can be present in the\nupper troposphere of Jupiter in abundances much greater than their predicted equilibrium abundances. The disequilibrium quenching of N2 and HCN on Jupiter has been\ndiscussed by several investigators145,10,20,21 (see also the relevant discussions for other\nsolar-system applications146\u2212148 ).\nThrough time-constant and quenching-level arguments, Lewis and Fegley10 suggest that HCN would quench at \u223c1200 K on Jupiter, resulting in a quenched steady-\n\nstate mole fraction for HCN of only \u223c1 \u00d7 10\u221212 for a solar-composition gas. Lewis and\nFegley,10 using arguments from Prinn and Fegley,147 suggest that the rate-limiting step\nresponsible for quenching the HCN abundance is the reaction H2 + HCN \u2194 CH2 + NH.\nThe rate coefficient for this reaction and its reverse have never been measured; Lewis\n\nand Fegley10 assume that the reverse reaction will proceed rapidly with a rate coefficient\nof 1 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 . The rate coefficient in the forward direction is then estimated\n\nfrom the equilibrium constant of the reaction, along with the reverse rate coefficient,\nusing the principle of microscopic reversibility. Fegley and Lodders20 make these same\nassumptions in their follow-up study, but they derive a much larger quenched HCN mole\nfraction of 0.6-2.6 ppb for Jupiter. The differences between the two results are attributed\n\n\f28\nto the larger elemental enrichment factors used in the more recent study20,21 . We note\nthat the most likely products of the CH2 + NH reaction could be H2 CN + H and/or N\n+ CH3 , rather than HCN + H2 , so that the overall H2 + HCN reaction as stated might\nbe an oversimplification of a multiple-step process, but otherwise the assumptions seem\nreasonable. Is that reaction the only available mechanism for HCN loss, though? That\npremise seems unlikely. The reaction between HCN and H2 is very endothermic and\nwill be exceedingly slow, even at 1500 K, and we suspect there are more effective HCN\ndestruction mechanisms under deep-tropospheric conditions on Jupiter. Moreover, as\nis demonstrated by Smith,46 the adoption of the pressure scale height H for the characteristic length scale in the expression for the convective mixing time constant leads\nto a roughly two-order-of-magnitude overestimation of the transport time scale used in\nthe time-constant approach144,10,20,21 to predict quenched disequilibrium abundances on\nJupiter. If Smith46 is correct, the HCN quenching level is likely even deeper in the atmosphere than Fegley and Lodders20 have assumed (given their rate-limiting mechanism),\nwhich in turn suggests an even higher predicted quenched HCN mole fraction - a result\nin clear violation of the HCN upper limits.13\u221215\nThe details of the original Prinn and Barshay144 time-constant approach for CO\nquenching on Jupiter have been questioned.24,45\u221249 Both the assumed rate-limiting step\n(and its estimated rate coefficient) and the assumptions regarding the transport time\nscale have been criticized; several groups have suggested ways in which the original assumptions could be improved.24,45\u221249 . Fueled by these criticisms and suggested improvements, we have recently developed a way to bypass the back-of-the-envelope time-scale\napproach by directly modeling chemical kinetics and transport in the deep troposphere\nof Jupiter to more quantitatively investigate carbon-hydrogen-oxygen chemistry and the\ntransport-induced quenching of disequilibrium C-H-O species. The results are presented\nin Visscher et al.49 Using this model, we confirm the results of Smith46 regarding the\ntransport time constants and identify the most likely rate-limiting step for the quenching of CO on Jupiter. The new rate-limiting mechanism suggested by Visscher et al.49\nhelps resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Prinn and Barshay144 scheme\nand the origin of tropospheric CO on Jupiter, as well as helps constrain the deep water abundance on Jupiter. Based on kinetics and diffusion only, the model is able to\nreproduce the equilibrium composition at deep, hot atmospheric levels, and then transitions smoothly to a quenched regime at higher altitude levels based on the rates of\nthe reactions controlling the interconversion of the different atmospheric constituents.\n\n\f29\nFor this paper, we discuss the results regarding nitrogen chemistry in the deep Jovian\ntroposphere.\n4.1. Thermochemical model description\nWe again use the Caltech/JPL KINETICS code43 to solve the continuity equations for the atmospheric constituents, but we focus this time on Jupiter's deep troposphere. The model extends from 12,650 bar (2500 K) to 17.4 bar (399 K) in a grid of\n144 atmospheric levels, with a vertical resolution of at least twenty altitude levels per\nscale height. The assumed pressure-temperature profile in the 17-24 bar region is taken\nfrom the Galileo probe ASI data69 and is extended to greater depths along an adiabat,\nassuming ideal-gas behavior.148 Thermochemical equilibrium is adopted as an initial\ncondition, with elemental abundances taken from the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer\n(GPMS) results110,112 for carbon, nitrogen, and helium, but not for oxygen. The oxygen\nelemental abundance determined by the GPMS is considered to be a lower limit to the\ndeep Jovian abundance due to the probe's entry into an anomalous \"hot-spot\" region.107\nThe oxygen abundance in our model is set at 2.6 times the assumed protosolar value of\nH2 O/H2 = 9.61 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,149 where it is assumed here that a portion of the total oxygen\ncontent has already been removed by rock-forming elements (which we do not consider\nin the model). This level of oxygen enrichment was found by Visscher et al.49 to provide\n\na good fit to the observed tropospheric CO mole fraction.48 The NASA CEA code150\nis used to calculate thermodynamic equilibrium, with thermodynamic parameters taken\nfrom Gurvich et al.,151 Chase,152 , Burcat and Ruscic,153 and other literature sources.\nZero flux boundary conditions are adopted at the top and bottom of the model such\nthat no mass enters or leaves the system. Transport is assumed to occur through vertical\neddy diffusion, with our nominal model adopting a constant tropospheric Kzz of 1 \u00d7 108\ncm2 s\u22121 (see Visscher et al.49 for further details).\nWe use a subset of \u223c1800 reactions and \u223c120 species from our photochemical\nmodel described in Sections 2 and 3. Because we must fully reverse all our reactions\n(using the principle of microscopic reversibility) in order to accurately reproduce equilibrium compositions with the kinetic model, we are forced to omit several of the complex\norgano-nitrogen compounds observed in coupled C2 H2 -NH3 photolysis experiments36\u221239\ndue to a lack of information on thermodynamic properties (see Section 2 for a list of\nthese species). The top of our model (17 bar) is also deep enough that ultraviolet photons do not penetrate, so we neglect photolysis reactions. Other than these changes,\n\n\f30\nthe rate coefficient expressions are taken from the photochemical model. The kinetics of\nnitrogen species under deep-tropospheric conditions on Jupiter is less well understood\nthan the corresponding case for C-H-O species, and our predicted quench levels for the\nnitrogen-bearing species will be correspondingly less certain. We deem the modeling exercise worth the effort, however, if for nothing else than to suggest reactions that could\nbe important for the dominant quenching mechanisms and thus warrant further study.\nMore importantly, we hope to resolve the apparent paradox mentioned above regarding\nthe large quenched disequilibrium abundance of HCN in excess of observational limits\n(cf.15,20,21 ) that is predicted when the Lewis and Fegley10 rate-limiting kinetic mechanism for HCN destruction is used in combination with the convective-mixing length\nscale derived by Smith.46\n4.2. Thermochemical model results\nFigure 4 shows the results of our thermochemical kinetics and transport model\nfor some of the major nitrogen-bearing species. Because our kinetic model considers\nthe same species as our thermochemical-equilibrium calculations and because we fully\nreverse all of our kinetic reactions using that same thermodynamic data, our kinetic\nmodel will reproduce the equilibrium results in the absence of transport, provided that\nwe allow enough time for equilibrium to be achieved at any particular temperature. At\nhot, deep levels in the kinetics-transport model shown in Fig. 4, the kinetic reactions\nare very fast, and equilibrium is maintained. However, the species profiles diverge from\nequilibrium (shown with dashed lines in Fig. 4) when the kinetic rates can no longer keep\nup with dynamical mixing (i.e., when the transport time scale falls below the kinetic\nloss time scale for the species in question). This divergence occurs in the cooler, upper\nregions of the model: many reactions have significant activation barriers that cannot\nreadily be overcome as temperatures drop, so that the reactions proceed predominantly\nin one direction, and equilibrium is not preserved. At altitudes above this quench level,\nthe mole fraction of a quenched species remains constant. This behavior was first predicted analytically by Prinn and Barshay.144 Note that different species shown in Fig. 4\nhave different quench levels. Molecular nitrogen, with its strong triple bond, is difficult\nto destroy kinetically and so is quenched at relatively hot, deep levels, whereas HCN\nequilibrium is preserved even at relatively cool temperatures such that the quench level\nis at higher altitudes. Some species, such as HNCO and CH2 NH, exhibit more complex\nbehavior due to the effects of the quenching of other constituents. For instance, HNCO\n\n\f31\n\nFIGURE 4. Mole-fraction profiles (as labeled) for several nitrogen-bearing species in our\nJovian deep-troposphere thermochemical kinetics and transport model for an assumed\nconstant eddy diffusion coefficient of 1 \u00d7 108 cm2 s\u22121 . The dashed lines show our thermochemical equilibrium solution. Note that kinetic reactions are so fast in the hotter,\ndeeper regions of the model that equilibrium can be maintained. However, the species\nabundances diverge from equilibrium and are quenched at colder, higher levels as the\ntransport time scale drops below the kinetic time constants for conversion between the\ndifferent species.\nfirst begins to diverge from equilibrium when CO quenches, but HNCO itself does not\nquench until it reaches higher altitudes. In the intervening regions, HNCO continues\nto maintain an equilibrium with the quenched CO. Similarly, CH2 NH diverges from\nequilibrium when HCN quenches but does not itself fully quench until it reaches higher\naltitudes.\nBased on our adopted nitrogen reaction mechanism, we find that HCN does not\nquench until it reaches the \u223c880-K, 260-bar level. As a result, the quenched mole\nfraction is only \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u221214 , a value well below the observational limit for HCN of 0.93\n\n\f32\nppb in the Jovian upper troposphere.15 The dominant mechanism for HCN loss in our\nmodel is the following scheme:\nM\n\nH + HCN \u2212\u2192 H2 CN\n\nH2 + H2 CN \u2212\u2192 CH2 NH + H\nM\n\nH + CH2 NH \u2212\u2192 CH2 NH2\n\nH2 + CH2 NH2 \u2212\u2192 CH3 NH2 + H\nM\n\nCH3 NH2 \u2212\u2192 CH3 + NH2\n\nH2 + NH2 \u2212\u2192 NH3 + H\nH2 + CH3 \u2212\u2192 CH4 + H\nM\n\n2 H \u2212\u2192 H2\nNet : HCN + 3 H2 \u2212\u2192 NH3 + CH4 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe rate-limiting step in this scheme is the H2 + H2 CN \u2192 CH2 NH + H reaction. Our\n\nrate coefficient for this reaction comes from the reverse reaction, whose rate coefficient\nhas been calculated from the DHT method.60 Although the rate coefficient for the\nH2 + H2 CN \u2192 CH2 NH + H reaction is a relatively low \u223c3 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm3 s\u22121 at the\nquench level, it is still much faster than the likely rate for the H2 + HCN reaction\n\nsuggested as the rate-limiting step by Lewis and Fegley10 and subsequent modelers20,21\nbecause of the relative reactivity of H2 CN versus HCN. Note that our scheme begins\nwith the three-body addition of H to HCN, and continues with the products reacting\nwith H and/or H2 , which are abundant in the Jovian troposphere, to form a hydrogensaturated single-bonded species, which can then thermally dissociate to break the C-N\nbond. A very similar scheme was invoked by Visscher et al.49 to explain the dominant\nmechanism for breaking the strong carbon-oxygen bond and destroying CO in the Jovian\ndeep troposphere (see also45 ), and we find N2 to be destroyed by a similar process.\nFor instance, the dominant scheme leading to N2 destruction in our model is\nM\n\nH + N2 \u2212\u2192 NNH\n\nH2 + NNH \u2212\u2192 N2 H2 + H\nM\n\nH + N2 H2 \u2212\u2192 N2 H3\n\nH2 + N2 H3 \u2212\u2192 NH2 + NH3\n\nH2 + NH2 \u2212\u2192 NH3 + H\nNet : N2 + 3 H2 \u2212\u2192 2 NH3 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f33\nwhere NNH has recently been recognized as an important intermediate in the combustion\nchemistry of nitrogen species, particularly in flame fronts where the concentration of\natoms is high.60 Note the similarity of the first three steps in this reaction scheme (3)\nto the first three steps in our dominant HCN destruction scheme (2) above. The ratelimiting step in this N2 destruction scheme (3) is H + N2 H2 + M \u2192 N2 H3 + M. Our rate\ncoefficient for this reaction again comes from the reverse reaction, whose rate coefficient\nwas derived from QRRK analysis by Dean and Bozzelli.60\n\nAs with the destruction of other species with strong bonds in our model, our\nproposed mechanism begins with H addition to the very stable N2 molecule, followed by\nsequential reactions of H2 and H to form a single-bonded N-N species, before the N-N\nbond is broken. This mechanism differs significantly from the N2 + H2 \u2192 2 NH gas-\n\nphase, rate-limiting mechanism suggested by previous investigators.145\u2212147,10,20,21 Our\nmechanism leads to somewhat more effective conversion of N2 \u2192 NH3 in Jupiter's deep\n\ntroposphere; however, given the near-vertical slope of the N2 equilibrium profile at depth,\nour prediction for the quenched disequilibrium N2 mole fraction of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 does not\n\ndiffer too much from the 2-3 \u00d7 10\u22125 mole fraction predicted by Fegley and Lodders,20\nwho assumed a slightly smaller nitrogen elemental abundance in their model (see also21 ).\n\nIn fact, the assumptions about the deep nitrogen elemental abundances on Jupiter have\nthe largest effect on the predictions concerning the mole fraction of N2 dredged up from\nthe deep atmosphere.20 No matter what the actual rate-limiting step is, we agree with\nthe conclusions of Prinn and Olaguer145 and subsequent modelers that N2 is likely to be\nthe most abundant quenched disequilibrium species in the upper troposphere of Jupiter.\nNote that the conversion of N2 to NH3 might also occur heterogeneously on the\nsurface of metallic iron grains,145 as in the industrial Haber process. If catalytic N2\ndestruction on grain surfaces is occurring on Jupiter, Prinn and Olaguer145 demonstrate\nthat this process could be more efficient than the pure gas-phase mechanism we consider, leading to a reduced, but still significant, N2 mole fraction of 0.3-6 ppm in their\nmodel. However, modern chemical equilibrium calculations20,21,154 demonstrate that Fe\nis removed from the atmosphere by condensation at altitudes much deeper than the level\nwhere the catalysis would be occurring on Jupiter, making metallic iron unavailable as\na catalyst for N2 \u2192 NH3 conversion. The presence of another suitable catalyst remains\nproblematic, and homogeneous gas-phase reactions are expected to dominate.20\nMolecular nitrogen is stable in the Jovian upper troposphere: N2 does not readily\nreact with the photolytic products of NH3 and hydrocarbon photochemistry, and it is\n\n\f34\n\nFIGURE 5. Mole-fraction profiles for N2 , HCN, and CH3 NH2 in our nominal thermochemical kinetics and diffusion model with Kzz = 1.0 \u00d7 108 cm2 s\u22121 (solid lines)\ncompared with a model with Kzz = 1.0 \u00d7 109 cm2 s\u22121 (dotted lines). The dashed lines\nshow the thermochemical equilibrium solution.\n\nshielded from photolysis by the large overlying column of H2 . We expect N2 to survive\nwell into the upper stratosphere, where its mole fraction will eventually be reduced due\nto molecular diffusion. Galactic cosmic rays may initiate interesting N2 chemistry, as\nsuggested for Neptune,155 and N2 may participate in interesting ionospheric chemistry,\nas on Titan.156\nAs originally noted by Lewis and Fegley,10 the quenched mole fraction of methylamine (CH3 NH2 ) is greater than that of HCN, so that the additional deep tropospheric\nsource of CH3 NH2 could enhance photochemical production of HCN (see the last part of\nscheme (1) above). However, the upper-tropospheric quenched mole fraction of CH3 NH2\nin our model is only 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 . Even if the conversion of CH3 NH2 into HCN were 100%\n\neffective, the HCN produced from CH3 NH2 photochemistry would still be well below the\nHCN upper limits.13\u221215\n\n\f35\nFegley and Lodders,20 Lodders and Fegley,21 and Visscher et al. 49 demonstrate\nthat the mole fractions of the quenched species on Jupiter are very sensitive to the\nadopted eddy diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the quench level. Our adopted nominal Kzz value of 1 \u00d7 108 cm2 s\u22121 is based on free-convection and mixing-length theory\nfor a rapidly rotating atmosphere.157,158,49 The exact value of the eddy diffusion coefficient is uncertain by about an order of magnitude. A larger value would lead to more\nrapid mixing and a quench level deeper in the atmosphere, with correspondingly higher\nvalues for the mole fractions of quenched disequilibrium species like HCN, CH3 NH2 , and\nCO. Figure 5 illustrates how the quenched abundances of N2 , HCN, and CH3 NH2 would\nchange for a larger assumed Kzz of 1 \u00d7 109 cm2 s\u22121 . Even with this maximum value of\nKzz , the predicted upper-tropospheric mole fraction for HCN is well below the observational upper limit. Note that the equilibrium gradient in the deep troposphere controls\nhow the quenched abundance will be affected by the eddy diffusion coefficient; N2 , with\nits nearly vertical profile near the quench levels, is relatively unaffected, whereas HCN\nis strongly affected.\nOne loss mechanism for HCN that is not in the model is reaction of HCN with NH3\nto form condensed NH4 CN salt, as was originally suggested by Lewis.143 The formation of\nthis species may significantly limit the possible vapor abundance of HCN at temperatures\nbelow \u223c160 K (i.e., above 0.9 bar) on Jupiter.\n5. Discussion\nOur modeling suggests that neither the photochemical source nor the deep tropospheric source can provide much HCN to the Jovian upper troposphere - a result that is\nconsistent with the low observational upper limit for non-cometary HCN on Jupiter.13\u221215\nOur conclusions are at odds with some of the previous modeling predictions found in\nthe literature,35,20,21 and we now discuss some of the reasons for the differences.\n5.1. Deep tropospheric HCN source compared with previous models\nThe quenched-disequilibrium model that can be most directly compared with ours\nis that of Fegley and Lodders,20 due to the greater-than-solar nitrogen elemental abundance assumed in both models: we assume a NH3 /H2 ratio of 6.64 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,112 whereas\n\nFegley and Lodders20 assume a NH3 /H2 ratio of 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . Fegley and Lodders20 use\na time-constant approach rather than thermochemical kinetics and transport models,\n\n\f36\nbut we can use similar arguments for our comparisons. Based on an earlier estimate\nfrom Prinn and Fegley147 , Fegley and Lodders20 assume that the rate-limiting step in\nthe reduction of HCN is the reaction HCN + H2 \u2192 CH2 + NH, with an estimated rate\n\ncoefficient of 1.08 \u00d7 10\u22128 exp(\u221270, 456/T ) cm3 s\u22121 , for T in K. The estimated chemical\nkinetic time constant for HCN destruction is then\n\u03c4chem = (1.08 \u00d7 10\u22128 exp(\u221270, 456/T ) [H2 ])\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\nIf one then assumes that the convective mixing time scale \u03c4mix = L2 /Kzz , with the\neffective convective length scale L being the atmospheric pressure scale height H, then\n\u03c4mix is equal to \u03c4chem at level at which the equilibrium HCN mole fraction is \u223c1 \u00d7 10\u22129\nin the Fegley and Lodders model20 - a value similar to the observed HCN upper limit\nof 0.93 ppb.15 However, Smith46 argues that the effective mixing length scale L is more\nlike 0.11H, such that \u03c4mix would be equal to \u03c4chem deeper in the atmosphere, near the\n2300-bar, 1630-K level in our model, at which point the equilibrium HCN mole fraction\nwould be \u223c1.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 . This value is almost twenty times the observational upper limit for\n\nHCN and is clearly not supported by the infrared and submillimeter observations.13\u221215\n\nThus, we have an apparent paradox in that the predicted HCN mole fraction from the\nquenched deep-tropospheric source can only be consistent with the observational upper\nlimits if one ignores the modeling of Smith.46\nWe propose a resolution to this apparent paradox. Our model contains several\nmore efficient pathways to HCN \u2192 NH3 conversion than the HCN + H2 \u2192 CH2 + NH\nrate-limiting step first proposed by Prinn and Fegley.147 Scheme (2) above shows the\nmost effective HCN \u2192 NH3 conversion scheme in our model, but there are also several\nothers that are more efficient than the Prinn and Fegley mechanism.147 The rate-limiting\nstep in scheme (2) is the reaction\nH2 + H2 CN \u2192 CH2 NH + H ,\n\n(4)\n\nfor which the rate coefficient in our model is determined from the reverse reaction.60\nWe can fit an Arhennius expression to our rate coefficient for reaction (4), as calculated\nfrom the reverse reaction: k4 = 1.011 \u00d7 10\u221218 T 1.941 exp(\u221210, 682.5/T ) cm3 s\u22121 , for T\nin K. If we use this reaction as our rate-limiting step, the kinetic time constant for HCN\ndestruction is\n\u03c4chem =\n\n[HCN]\n[HCN]\n=\n.\nd[HCN]/dt\nk4 [H2 ] [H2 CN]\n\n\f37\nThen, using equilibrium calculations along with an effective length scale of L \u2248 0.11H,46\nwe find that \u03c4chem equals \u03c4mix at the \u223c870-K, \u223c250-bar level in our model, where the\n\nequilibrium HCN mole fraction is 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 from this time-constant approach, compared\n\nto our model-derived value of 6 \u00d7 10\u221214 . The similarity in the results from the timeconstant approach using the Smith46 length scale as compared with our thermochemical\n\nkinetics and transport model results suggests that (a) the Smith46 results are indeed\nreasonable and should not be ignored (as they frequently are now) by those who use\ntime-constant arguments to calculate the abundance of quenched disequilibrium species\ndredged up from the deep troposphere, and (b) the time-constant approach is valid\n(i.e., one does not need a full thermochemical kinetics and transport model to predict\nquenched disequilibrium abundances on the giant planets). Visscher et al.49 came to\nsimilar conclusions from their modeling of CO reduction on Jupiter (see also B\u00e9zard et\nal.48 ). Furthermore, the fact that our derived quenched HCN mole fraction lies comfortably below the observational upper limits suggests that there are faster mechanisms for\nconverting HCN to NH3 in the Jovian troposphere than the HCN + H2 \u2192 CH2 + NH\nreaction originally proposed by Prinn and Fegley.147\nOur dominant schemes for the reduction of HCN, N2 , and CO (see Visscher et\n\nal.49 ) on Jupiter all start with H-atom addition, followed by reaction of the H2 CN, NNH,\nor HCO adducts with H2 , and subsequent reactions with H and/or H2 to eventually\nform species with single C-N, N-N, or C-O bonds, before those bonds are finally broken.\nWe thus find alternative pathways to the H2 -plus-strongly-bonded-constituent reactions\nthat form the backbone of the mechanisms proposed by Prinn and Barshay,144 , Prinn\nand Fegley,147 Prinn and Olaguer,145 and subsequent modelers. Yung et al.45 call such\nreactions \"kinetically too ambitious\" - a wonderful phrase that has been often quoted.\nOur mechanism suggests that other, less ambitious reactions can do the job.\nNot all the reactions in our full mechanism have firmly determined rate coefficients, and we may be missing important pathways and/or species in our reaction list.\nAs such, we cannot be completely confident in our derived abundances for the quenched\ndisequilibrium species. However, the model development is based on the best reaction\nrate coefficients available today from combustion-chemistry studies and terrestrial atmospheric chemistry studies (both of which are unfortunately concerned more with the\noxidation of reduced species than the reduction of oxidized species) and are likely significant improvements over the H2 + N2 and H2 + HCN mechanisms proposed 30 years ago.\nGiven the likely importance of such processes for extrasolar giant planets, as well as for\n\n\f38\ngiant planets within our own solar system, we encourage further study of the dominant\nmechanisms for the reduction of N2 and HCN in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.\n5.2. Photochemical HCN source and the tropospheric C2 H2 abundance\nOur modeling in Section 3 demonstrates that NH3 -C2 H2 photochemical coupling\nis not a significant source of HCN on Jupiter. Photochemical destruction of C2 H2 in the\nlower stratosphere limits the amount of acetylene that diffuses into the NH3 photolysis\nregion, and both condensation and photolysis limit the amount of NH3 that diffuses\ninto the stratosphere. Ammonia and acetylene are simply not present in large enough\nquantities together to provide a source of HCN. In contrast, Kaye and Strobel35 predict\nthat as much as a few ppb HCN could form in the upper troposphere from coupled NH3 C2 H2 photochemistry. As we mention above, the main difference in our models relates\nto the C2 H2 abundance rather than to major differences in the kinetic reaction-rate coefficients adopted for the first critical pathway for formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds.\nFor their model in which a few ppb of HCN is formed, Kaye and Strobel35 assume a\nfixed acetylene distribution in which C2 H2 is uniformly mixed with altitude at a mixing ratio of 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 , based on observations available at the time,159 whereas our model\n\npredicts C2 H2 mole fractions of 1 ppb at \u223c80 mbar, with rapidly increasing mole fractions at higher altitudes and decreasing mole fractions at lower altitudes (see Fig. 2).\nHowever, even with the older observations,159 the mixing-ratio profiles that provided\nthe best fit to the observed spectra required C2 H2 to be depleted below the 100-mbar\nlevel, suggesting little C2 H2 in the troposphere. More recent ultraviolet and infrared\nobservations clearly indicate that the C2 H2 mole fraction decreases with decreasing altitude in Jupiter's stratosphere,13,106,115,160,161 firmly pointing to an upper stratospheric\nphotochemical source for the acetylene. Moreover, a severe constraint on the tropospheric C2 H2 mole fraction is indicated by the lack of absorption wings observed for the\nresolved C2 H2 line profiles in thermal-infrared spectra.133,161 Thus, the fact that all recent Jovian hydrocarbon photochemical models predict a rapidly decreasing C2 H2 mole\nfraction in the lower stratosphere and into the troposphere50,106,125,135,161\u2212167 appears\nconsistent with present-day observations.106\nIn contrast, two sets of observations have been used to suggest that the C2 H2\nmole fraction is relatively large in the Jovian troposphere. The first observation consists\nof ultraviolet spectra from the Jovian equatorial region taken with the Faint Object\nSpectrograph (FOS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).132,133 The acetylene\n\n\f39\nprofile derived from the B\u00e9tr\u00e9mieux and Yelle132 and B\u00e9tr\u00e9mieux et al.133 analyses of this\ndata exhibit a mole fraction that decreases with decreasing altitude in the stratosphere\nbut then increases again in the troposphere, for a best fit mole fraction of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127\n\nin the 120-700 mbar region. This large increase in the troposphere has been used as\nevidence that lightning and thundershock sources of acetylene production exist in the\nJovian troposphere.168 The second observation is the Galileo probe mass spectrometer\ndata110,112 that are interpreted as being consistent with ethane and other non-methane\nhydrocarbons going through a mole-fraction minimum near the 1-bar level, followed by\nan increased mole fraction at pressures greater than 16 bar.169 Hunten169 interprets\nthe GPMS signature as being caused by efficient ethane and acetylene adsorption on\nstratospheric and tropospheric aerosols, which then rain down through the atmosphere\nuntil they reach temperatures high enough for desorption to occur.\nWe find these reports of large tropospheric mole fractions of C2 H2 and/or C2 H6\nto be unconvincing, at least for the bulk of the planet. The HST/FOS ultraviolet spectra\nare affected by scattering and absorption from many gas-phase and aerosol species, all\nof which have poorly constrained parameters. Both NH3 and C2 H2 are clearly detected\nin the HST/FOS ultraviolet spectra,132,133 but deriving mole fractions from the spectra\nmay be problematic. The strongest argument against the 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 tropospheric C2 H2\nmole fraction derived by B\u00e9tr\u00e9mieux et al.133 is that such a large amount would generate\nabsorption wings around observed mid-infrared C2 H2 emission lines, which B\u00e9tr\u00e9mieux\net al. recognize is inconsistent with their own ground-based infrared data,133 as well as\nwith other mid-infrared observations.115,161 The NH3 profile derived from the HST/FOS\ndataset133 also differs considerably from profiles inferred from other observations (see\nFig. 3e) for reasons that are unclear. B\u00e9tr\u00e9mieux et al.133 suggest that their unexpectedly large derived C2 H2 tropospheric mole fraction, as well as their unexpectedly small\nderived NH3 mole fraction, could result from uncertain NH3 ultraviolet absorption cross\nsections at relevant Jovian temperatures, from some kind of dynamical situation where\nthe temperature profile masks the C2 H2 infrared absorption wings, or from tropospheric\nNH3 and C2 H2 profiles that vary with location and/or time on Jupiter. We note that\nthe spatially resolved Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) data of Nixon et\nal.161 preclude such large C2 H2 mole fractions over all the latitude regions that were investigated by CIRS, although given the size of the HST/FOS footprint, the explanation\nof an anomalous localized atmospheric region may still be possible.\nIn any case, the global-average Infrared Space Observatory data of Fouchet et\n\n\f40\nal.115 and the spatially resolved Cassini/CIRS data analyzed by Nixon et al.161 demonstrate that the spectral shape of the thermal-infrared C2 H2 features is inconsistent with\nlarge tropospheric C2 H2 mole fractions being present over the bulk of Jupiter.\nThe increase in the mole fraction of heavy hydrocarbons in the GPMS data\ndescribed by Hunten169 occurs too deep to affect infrared spectra, and no remote-sensing\nobservations currently exist to test this claim. However, the suggestion169 that the\nGPMS data are consistent with the adsorption of non-methane hydrocarbons onto fluffy\nstratospheric and upper-tropospheric aerosols that then sediment into the troposphere to\nevaporate at high temperatures has been questioned by Wong,170 based on the extensive\nGMPS calibrations from his thesis.171 Wong170 states that the GPMS data \"do not\nsupport the vertical variation of ethane mixing ratio\" that is key to the Hunten1968\naerosol adsorption/desorption model. In particular, the GPMS data do not support\nan upper-tropospheric minimum in the ethane mole fraction, nor do they indicate that\nthe mole fraction increases with depth in the troposphere. Wong170 provides evidence,\nincluding the relative abundances of the measured species, that suggests that the nonmethane hydrocarbons measured in the troposphere in the 8.5-12 bar region by the\nGPMS were instrumentally generated.\nWe suggest additional problems with the adsorption/desorption hypothesis. In\nthe Hunten169 model, a mole fraction of 3 ppm of non-methane hydrocarbons (mostly\nethane) must be removed from \u223c30 mbar (see his Fig. 3) through adsorption. For a\n30-mbar atmospheric density of 1.6 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 , that means 4.8 \u00d7 1012 ethane molecules\ncm\u22123 must be removed, for a column density of 9.6 \u00d7 1018 ethane molecules cm\u22122 (or re-\n\nally only \u223c70% of this value since some ethane gas remains at 30 mbar), compared with\nan estimated stratospheric haze column density of (3-8) \u00d7 108 particles cm\u22122 (see Fig. 12\n\nof West et al.172 ). These haze particles must be fluffy indeed to accommodate \u223c 1010\nadsorbed ethane molecules per particle. The situation is even worse at 1 bar, where an\n\nethane mole fraction of \u223c4 \u00d7 10\u22127 must be lost, corresponding to an ethane column density of \u223c4.4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 that must removed from the 1-bar region. The total mass that\nmust be adsorbed per particle is likely greater than the mass of the particle itself, and\nlayer upon layer of ethane molecules must adsorb on top of each other, which does not\n\ntypically happen in adsorption processes. In fact, Curtis et al.173 show that significant\nethane adsorption (i.e., a monolayer or greater) does not occur on tholin particles unless\nthe ethane concentration is at or above the ethane saturation vapor density, which never\noccurs in the Jovian atmosphere. Although the stratospheric hazes on Jupiter may be\n\n\f41\ncomposed of solid H2 O (from an external source), benzene, and/or butane,50 or perhaps\nP2 H4 and N2 H4 particles that have been transported through the tropopause from below, rather than tholins, the Curtis et al.173 study suggests that ethane and probably\nacetylene condensation under the greatly subsaturated conditions on Jupiter is not likely\nto be as efficient as Hunten169 have assumed. Therefore, because of problems with the\nphysics of the adsorption process itself, as well as to the interpretation of the GPMS\ndata, we deem it unlikely that the Hunten aerosol adsorption/desorption mechanism169\ncould operate to release a significant amount C2 H2 into the Jovian troposphere.\nAlthough it is clear that C2 H2 is not abundant in the troposphere of Jupiter\nin a global sense, the possibility that localized regions could contain enhanced tropospheric acetylene due to lightning24,25 or dynamical effects has not been ruled out. We\ntherefore investigate a photochemical model for which the bottom boundary condition\nfor C2 H2 has been changed to a mole fraction of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 .132,133 We also change the\n\nbottom boundary conditions for N2 and CH3 NH2 to mole fractions of 3.52 \u00d7 10\u22125 and\n1.52 \u00d7 10\u221212 , respectively, to reflect the deep-tropospheric quenched source from our\n\nnominal thermochemical kinetics and transport model (see Fig. 4). Species like NH3 ,\nNH2 , and N2 H4 are relatively unaffected by the increased C2 H2 and CH3 NH2 abundances\n(N2 is effectively inert in the Jovian upper troposphere), but CH2 NH, CH3 NH2 , HCN,\nCH3 CN, C2 H5 NH2 , C2 H3 CN, and all the nitrogen-bearing organic species observed in\nthe Keane et al.39 C2 H2 /NH3 /H2 photolysis experiments are significantly enhanced when\nthe C2 H2 abundance is increased. Ethylamine, in particular, shows a particularly large\nincrease and approaches 1 ppb in our model; however, ethylamine condensation, which\nis not currently included in the model, will eventually limit the column abundance. Figure 6 shows the enhancement in the HCN abundance that would result from coupled\nC2 H2 -NH3 photochemistry when more C2 H2 is available in the Jovian troposphere. The\nresulting increase in the tropospheric HCN mole fraction of two orders of magnitude is\nnot as large as one might expect because significant loss processes for C2 H2 still exist\nin the lower stratosphere and tropopause region that convert C2 H2 to C2 H6 and heavier\nhydrocarbons rather than to nitriles and other nitrogen-bearing organics. The C2 H2\nmole fraction remains low in the NH3 photolysis region, with a minimum mole fraction\nof only 1.4 ppb at 124 mbar. The HCN mole fraction therefore still remains below the\nobservational upper limits, even with the increased C2 H2 lower boundary condition. The\nonly way to increase the HCN abundance from coupled NH3 -C2 H2 coupled chemistry\nwould be to invoke rapid dynamical mixing near the tropopause, such that more C2 H2\n\n\f42\nand NH3 are available in the ammonia photolysis region.\n5.3. Thunderstorm source for HCN\nBar-Nun and Podolak24 and Podolak and Bar-Nun25 advocate lightning, and the\nresulting shock waves produced from lightning, as a source of HCN (and C2 H2 and CO)\nfor the Jovian troposphere. A discussion of the relative effectiveness of such a source\nis beyond the scope of this paper. The Bar-Nun and Podolak24 and Podolak and BarNun25 model calculations depend on several unknown parameters such as production\nefficiencies per energy released in the lightning event, the location of lightning within\nthe cloud (which must be in the top portion of the H2 O cloud to have HCN and C2 H2\nas significant products), the assumed attenuation of the observed visible light within\nthe cloud, the optical efficiency of the lightning, and the fate of the products once\nthey are generated. The fact that their derived HCN mole fraction is greater than\nthe observational upper limits13\u221215 suggests that some of the terms in their calculation\nmay need reevaluation. Note that although lightning production of C2 H2 could lead to\nenhanced photochemical production of HCN, the resulting HCN mole fraction would\nnot necessarily be observable (see Fig. 6).\nSeveral observational tests should be available to evaluate the likelihood of lightning contributing to the global production of disequilibrium species on Jupiter. If production is as effective as the models suggest,24,25 disequilibrium species should be greatly\nenhanced within active thunderstorms, and the dispersion to other latitudes would not be\ninstantaneous. Therefore, investigators could look for local enhancements in disequilibrium tropospheric species (e.g., C2 H2 from thermal infrared or ultraviolet observations,\nCO and HCN from infrared, millimeter, or sub-millimeter observations) at latitudes\nwhere active lightning storms are known to be prevalent.174 Such observational tests\nmight be more readily available for Saturn, from Cassini data already obtained or from\nthe extended mission, but should also be possible for Jupiter from ground-based observations and from the Juno mission. We encourage studies of the spatial distribution\nof tropospheric disequilibrium constituents on Jupiter and Saturn to help evaluate the\nlightning source.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have developed two theoretical models to investigate the production and\n\n\f43\n\nFIGURE 6. Mole-fraction profiles for acetylene (top) and hydrogen cyanide (bottom)\nfrom our Jovian photochemical model. The dashed line represents our nominal model, as\ndiscussed in Section 3. The solid line represents a model in which the bottom boundary\nconditions for C2 H2 , N2 , and CH3 NH2 have been increased to mole fractions of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n3.52 \u00d7 10\u22125 , and 1.52 \u00d7 10\u221212 .\n\n\f44\nloss of HCN and other nitrogen-bearing organics in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The first\nmodel covers the upper troposphere and stratosphere, for which we use the Caltech/JPL\nKINETICS code43 to track coupled NH3 -C2 H2 and NH3 -CH4 photochemistry. The second model covers the deep troposphere, for which we again use the KINETICS code,\nbut this time to track the thermochemical kinetics and transport of nitrogen species\nin the hot, high-pressure troposphere. We use simulations of the laboratory photolysis experiments,38,39 along with theoretical calculations from the combustion-chemistry\nliterature,60 to help constrain uncertain rate coefficients in our reaction mechanism. We\nfind that the photochemical production of HCN and other organo-nitrogen compounds\nis greatly inhibited in Jupiter's atmosphere. As was first discussed by Strobel,100 our\nmodels suggest that ammonia condensation in the upper troposphere, combined with\nefficient photolysis and the resulting generation of the condensible N2 H4 photoproduct,\nlimit the availability of NH3 in the Jovian stratosphere. Ammonia then does not diffuse\ninto the upper atmosphere to the methane photolysis region to participate in coupled\nNH3 -CH4 photochemistry. Contrary to several suggestions in the literature,35\u221239 we find\nthat coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry is inefficient in Jupiter's troposphere when realistic C2 H2 mixing-ratio profiles are considered. As is apparent from both photochemical\nmodels and observations, acetylene has a large mixing-ratio gradient in the stratosphere,\nleading to low abundances of C2 H2 in the tropopause region. The main factor inhibiting\nthe photochemical production of HCN and other nitrogen-bearing organics on Jupiter\nis the low acetylene abundance in the region where NH3 is being photolyzed. Our predicted HCN mole fraction from our photochemical model is well below the upper limits\nderived from infrared and sub-millimeter observations.13\u221215\nConsistent with other investigations that were based solely on time-constant\narguments,10,20,21,145 our thermochemical kinetics and transport models suggest that\ntransport-induced quenching of equilibrium abundances in Jupiter's deep troposphere\nleads to large predicted mole fractions of N2 and small predicted mole fractions of hydrogen cyanide in Jupiter's upper troposphere. However, our mechanisms for HCN and\nN2 destruction differ considerably from those suggested by previous investigators. Our\nmodels confirm the results of Smith,46 who demonstrates that the effective length scale\nfor atmospheric mixing has been overestimated in the time-scale arguments of the above\ninvestigators. As a result, the suggested rate-limiting step for HCN destruction originally suggested by Fegley and Prinn147 and used by later investigators is too slow to be\nconsistent with the observed HCN upper limits - HCN would quench too deep in the\n\n\f45\natmosphere, where the equilibrium HCN mole fraction is large, if the suggested HCN\n+ H2 \u2192 CH2 + NH reaction is the rate-limiting step. We instead find that HCN in\n\nour thermochemical kinetics and transport model is destroyed through a series of reactions that begin with H-atom addition to HCN, followed by reactions with H2 and\nH to eventually form a single-bonded C-N species (CH3 NH2 ) that can then thermally\ndecompose to break the C-N bond (see scheme (2) above). The rate-limiting step for\nHCN reduction in our mechanism is the reaction H2 + H2 CN \u2192 CH2 NH + H, where we\n\nhave calculated the rate coefficient of this reaction from that of the reverse reaction.60\nThis scheme, and others like it, are much more efficient than the proposed HCN + H2\n\ndestruction reaction,147 and our predicted quenched disequilibrium HCN mole fraction\nis therefore comfortably below the HCN observational upper limits.13\u221215\nReduction of N2 in our model follows a similar scheme (see scheme (3) above)\nwith the reaction N2 H2 + H + M \u2192 N2 H3 + M being the rate-limiting step. Molecular\n\nnitrogen is likely to be very abundant (\u223c30 ppm) on Jupiter from this quenched deeptropospheric source (see also Prinn and Olaguer147 and subsequent modelers), and N2\n\nshould survive to be transported up into the upper atmosphere, where its mole fraction\nwill eventually be reduced due to molecular diffusion. The interaction of galactic cosmic\nrays with N2 might initiate interesting N2 chemistry on Jupiter (see the equivalent\nNeptune study155 ), although the stratospheric HCN upper limit of 0.8 ppb13 may place\nconstraints on the effectiveness of this process. Molecular nitrogen may also participate\nin Jovian ionospheric chemistry, as on Titan,156,175\u2212181 with interesting consequences\nfor the composition, structure, and time-variability of the lower ionosphere, as well as\nfor the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other neutral species. The\nchemistry of N2 in the auroral regions might be particularly interesting. The suggested\nlarge N2 mole fraction on Jupiter needs observational confirmation, however.\nOne way to investigate the hypothesis of \u223c30 ppm N2 on Jupiter would be to take\na more detailed look at the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer data. The N2 abundance\nhas never been definitively determined from the GPMS data because of concerns over an\n\ninternal source of CO2 from the instrument itself,110 which could contaminate the signal\nat 28 dalton/e\u2212 due to the CO+ daughter ion of CO2 .182 Wong171 calculated a combined\nCO + N2 mixing ratio relative to H2 of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 in the 8.5-12 bar pressure region of\nthe probe entry site. An N2 mixing ratio greater than this value can only be supported\nif the contribution from the internal instrumental CO2 source was overestimated in the\nWong171 study;182 this uncertainty highlights the need for further calibration studies to\n\n\f46\nbetter characterize the instrument-generated CO2 signal (if any) in the GPMS data.\nThe observational upper limits for tropospheric HCN13\u221215 and the lack of C2 H2\nabsorption wings in thermal-infrared data133,161 can be used help constrain the effectiveness of other disequilibrium production processes, such as that of lightning-induced\nchemistry.24,25 Upper limits to the tropospheric C2 H2 mole fraction from thermalinfrared observations are seldom provided in the literature, although such information\nwould aid our understanding of the role of lightning on Jupiter and the other giant\nplanets. Spatially resolved observations that compare the tropospheric composition of\nlatitude regions known to have active thunderstorms with the composition of quiescent\nregions would also provide important information on this topic.\nThe mechanisms proposed in our investigation are still speculative due to the\nlimited experimental data available for individual reactions of interest in the models. A\nbetter understanding of the pathways for reduction of HCN and N2 is of importance for\nstudies of the composition and chemical behavior of extrasolar giant planets and brown\ndwarfs, as well as for giant planets within our own solar system, and further investigation\ninto these processes is warranted. Our thermochemical kinetics and transport model in\nparticular can be applied to studies of the \"hot Jupiters\" that are being discovered at\nan astonishing rate around other stars. The photochemical model may also be of use\nto extrasolar-giant-planet studies. Although we find that coupled carbon-nitrogen photochemistry is not important on Jupiter, that result is largely due to the removal of\nNH3 from the upper atmosphere due to condensation, and we may anticipate alternative scenarios for warmer giant planets. If an extrasolar giant planet were located closer\nto its parent star (such that NH3 does not condense) but not so close that it is being\nintensely bombarded by ultraviolet radiation (such that strongly bonded species are not\nthe only surviving molecules), then coupled NH3 -C2 H2 and NH3 -CH4 photochemistry\ncould be very important indeed (see the theoretical planetary classes of Sudarsky et\nal.183 ). Coupled NH3 -C2 H2 photochemistry might also be important in cometary comae or any other astronomical environment where ammonia and acetylene are brought\ntogether in the presence of ultraviolet radiation. We therefore encourage further investigation into the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the organo-nitrogen compounds\nobserved in the photolysis experiments of Ferris and Ishikawa,36,37 Keane,38 and Keane\net al.39\nAcknowledgments\n\n\f47\nThe Caltech/JPL KINETICS code was developed jointly by Yuk L.
