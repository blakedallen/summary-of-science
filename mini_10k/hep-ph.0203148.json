The W bb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 and tt\u0304bb\u0304 production at LHC are irreducible backgrounds for possible observability of the Standard Model and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model light Higgs boson in processes\ninvolving associated W H, ZH and tt\u0304H production followed by the H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay. The comparison presented in this paper uses the background estimates obtained with (a) complete massive matrix element\nimplemented in AcerMC Monte Carlo generator and (b) PYTHIA implementation of the inclusive W , Z, and\ntt\u0304 production, followed by the parton showering mechanism. Both approaches lead to a production of the\nfinal state of interest but differ in the approximations used. The focal point of this study is the comparison\nof the two approaches when estimating the background contributions to the light Higgs boson searches at\nthe LHC.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe W bb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 and tt\u0304bb\u0304 production at LHC has been recognized , see e.g. [1,2], to present the most substantial irreducible backgrounds for the Standard Model (SM) and\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) light\nHiggs boson observability in the associated production,\nnamely W H, ZH and tt\u0304H, followed by the H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay. The 'light Higgs boson' is in this context understood\nas the Higgs boson having the mass between 90 GeV and\n130 GeV, thus describing the SM and MSSM Higgs boson(s) in the mass range indicated by the excess observed\nin searches of LEP experiments [3,4].\nThe potential of the ATLAS detector at LHC for the\nSM and MSSM Higgs boson observability in the tt\u0304H production has already been carefully studied and documented in [2] and [5]. The proposed analysis requires four identified (tagged) b-jets, reconstruction of both top-quarks\ndecaying in hadronic and leptonic modes and an observable peak in the invariant mass distribution of the remaining b-jet pair. The irreducible tt\u0304bb\u0304 background is estimated to contribute about 60-70% to the total background, which consists mostly of the processes with a tt\u0304\npair participating in the final state. The expected significance is deemed to be of the order of 3.6 \u03c3 for the Higgsboson mass of 120 GeV at integrated luminosity of 30f b\u22121,\nwith the expected signal-to-background ratio in the mass\nwindow rated to be 32%. The total contribution from the\na\n\nSupported in part by Polish Government grant KBN\n2P03B11819.\n\nW jjjjjj backgrounds was estimated to be an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the one consisting of tt\u0304jj events\nand the contribution of the tt\u0304Z production process was\nestimated to be negligible.\nThe potential for the Higgs boson observability in the\nW H (W \u2192 l\u03bd) production, considered as rather weak,\nis documented in [1] and [5]. The expected production\nrates would be sufficient for the signal observability in\nthe mass range around 120 GeV only if the backgrounds\nfrom W bb\u0304 and tt\u0304 events could be efficiently suppressed.\nFor this channel both b-quarks are required to be tagged\nas b-jets and the reconstruction of a peak in the invariant mass of the b-jet system concentrated in the interval\n\u00b1 20 GeV around the expected Higgs mass could lead\nto an evidence of the signal. The identification of the accompanying lepton is also required in order to trigger the\ndata acquisition. Relatively simple topology of the final\nstate does not leave much room for a severe optimisation of kinematic cuts. The only possibility which can be\nexplored seems to be using a veto on an additional jet\nto suppress reducible backgrounds or angular correlations\nbetween reconstructed b-jets themselves and/or between\nb-jets and leptons. Within the low luminosity operation,\nthe irreducible W bb\u0304 background contributes about 35% of\nthe total background to this channel, the expected signalto-background ratio in the given mass window being on\nthe order of a few percent. The expected significance is\nestimated to be on the level of 3.0 \u03c3 for the Higgs-boson\nmass of 120 GeV and integrated luminosity of 30f b\u22121.\n\n\f2\n\nB. P. Kersevan, E. Richter-Wa\u0327s: What is the Wbb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 or tt\u0304bb\u0304 irreducible background . . .\n\nMuch less promising, if not hopeless to consider, is\nthe observability of the ZH production with subsequent\nleptonic Z-boson decay. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, such a study was documented in [1]. Both bquarks are required to be tagged as b-jets and the accompanying leptons are required to be identified in order to\ntrigger the data acquisition as well as for a reconstruction\nof the resonant peak around the Z-boson mass. The presence of a peak in the reconstructed invariant mass of the\nb-jet system concentrated in a mass window of \u00b1 20 GeV\naround the expected Higgs mass would lead to an evidence\nof the signal. The irreducible Zbb\u0304 background contributes\nabout 80% of the total background to this channel, the\nexpected signal-to-background ratio in the mass window\nbeing on the order of a few percent. The expected significance is estimated to be about 1.0 \u03c3 for the Higgs-boson\nmass of 120 GeV and integrated luminosity of 30f b\u22121 .\nIt is thus evident that good theoretical understanding\nof the irreducible tt\u0304bb\u0304, W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 backgrounds is crucial\nfor the light Higgs boson observation at LHC.\nIn the presented study the two available, albeit qualitatively different, approaches for simulating these backgrounds are compared. The first one (ME) is to use the\nlowest order massive matrix elements of the AcerMC generator [6] which lead to the required final state. The latter\nis subsequently completed with the initial and final state\nradiation simulated via parton showering as implemented\nin the PYTHIA [7] or HERWIG [8] generators. The second one\n(PS) is to simulate inclusive tt\u0304, W and Z production using\nthe native PYTHIA or HERWIG implementations and subsequently obtain accompanying b-quarks using the parton\nshower approximation only. Both approaches have their\ncaveats. Using the complete 2 \u2192 4 matrix element might\nnot be sufficient as the b-quarks could appear at the different steps in the evolution of the partonic cascade and\nnot necessarily only at the hard process level. Resorting\nto the parton shower approach on the other hand tends\nin several cases to underestimate hardness of the radiated\npartons and does not reproduce well their topological configurations.\nIn the presented comparison the approach of concentrating not on the partonic distributions but on the reconstructed experimental quantities, i.e. jets and isolated leptons, is chosen. The generated events are thus treated with\na simplified reconstruction procedure using the algorithms\nof the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector at LHC [10]\nand subsequent fiducial cuts on reconstructed jets and isolated leptons are applied roughly as foreseen for this type\nof physics at LHC detectors: geometrical acceptance for\nb-jets and isolated leptons identification down to pseudorapidity \u03b7 of 2.5 and transverse momenta threshold for jets\nand leptons of 15 GeV. Although leptons will be identified\nwith the lower thresholds, the 15 GeV transverse momenta\nrepresents roughly what is needed for triggering on such\nevents. This limits the given comparison to the topological configurations close to those which will be selected by\nthe experimental analysis. In jet reconstruction a simple\nprocedure in form of a cone algorithm is performed, using a cone radius of 0.4 in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal\n\nangle plane. Subsequently, the procedures of jet energy\ncalibration and b-tagging are applied. In case jet-veto was\nalso applied, events with additional jets having transverse\nmomenta pT > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 5.0 were rejected. Efficiencies for b-tagging and lepton identification are not\nincluded in the given numbers, only the efficiencies for jet\nand b-jet reconstruction are taken into account. More details on the performance of the applied algorithms can be\nfound in [10].\nThe AcerMC Monte Carlo generator code and its interfaces to PYTHIA generator were used in the given evaluation. The generated statistics was typically about 106\nevents for the ME and 108 events for the PS simulation\nchain. The ME events were generated with AcerMC matrix\nelement implementations and the PS events were generated with the default settings of PYTHIA 6.2. The ME\nevents were further completed with the initial and final\nstate radiation to assure more realistic jet reconstruction\nefficiencies and multiplicities, thus leading to a better description of the interaction kinematics. The CTEQ5L[11]\nparton density functions were used for all estimations and\nproton-proton collision at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy\nwere simulated. A similar study could also be repeated\nusing HERWIG instead of PYTHIA generator.\nAt this point it might be relevant to mention that for\nthe inclusive W and Z/\u03b3 \u2217 production the so called improved parton shower algorithm is implemented in PYTHIA,\ni.e. some higher-order corrections are integrated; as shown\nin [12], it gives good description of the complete pW\nT spectrum. A corresponding improvement is also expected for\nthe production of jets in association with the W boson.\nFor the tt\u0304 production the standard parton algorithm is\nstill used PYTHIA.\nThe comparisons between these two generation approaches for W bb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 and tt\u0304bb\u0304 events are discussed in\nSection 2, 3 and 4 of the paper. Final conclusions are summarised in Section 5.\n\n2 The Wbb\u0304 irreducible background\nIn this section the irreducible W bb\u0304 background to the\nHiggs boson searches in the W H production, followed by\nthe H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay, is discussed. The evaluation is based\non two simulation approaches, ME and PS, as specified\nbelow:\n\u2013 ME: Use the 2 \u2192 4 matrix element for q q\u0304 \u2192 W (\u2192\nl\u03bd)g \u2217 (\u2192 bb\u0304) process as implemented in [6].

This matrix element represents\nthe lowest order contribution to the lbb\u0304 final state.\nThe initial (ISR) and final state radiation (FSR) are\nsimulated with parton shower of PYTHIA, followed by\nhadronisation in order to complete the event generation.\n\u2013 PS: Use the 2 \u2192 1 matrix element for q q\u0304 \u2192 W process\nas implemented in PYTHIA, followed by the ISR/FSR\nand hadronisation.

The implementation of this process includes\nISR/FSR modeled with an improved parton shower approach [12,13] to match/merge with higher order matrix element calculations for the pW\nT spectra.\nConsidering the heavy flavour content of the cascade,\na part of the higher order corrections is a priori already included in the parton shower approach (c.f. [14,15]) whereas\nonly the lowest order term for the g \u2217 \u2192 bb\u0304 splitting is\npresent in the matrix element calculations.\nHowever, as the 2 \u2192 4 matrix element with activated\nISR and FSR is used, a part of the higher-order corrections\nis also to some extend included (e.g. additional branchings\nof b \u2192 bg are made possible), however without a rigorous\ncheck on the possible double-counting [16]. In order to limit\nthe double counting possibility the scale of the ISR/FSR\nshower is tuned to avoid the radiated partons being harder\nthan the hard-process ones. What is not included in the\n2 \u2192 4 matrix element calculations is the contribution from\nevents where gluon and quark interact in the hard process\nto produce the W -boson, with the gluon splitting into bquarks occurring in the further steps of the cascade. As\nwell not included is the contribution where the final state\ngluon in the hard process decays into light quarks, while\nb-quarks appear in another branch of the partonic shower.\nComparison of the differential distributions of the pW\nT\nspectra is presented in Fig. 1. In the top plot the PS distribution after filtering on events with reconstructed 2 jets\n+ 1 lepton is shown, along with PS and ME distributions\nafter filtering on exactly 2 b-jets + 1 lepton. In the lower\n\nrange of the pW\nT spectra the PS events have different slope\nwhen requiring 2 jets or 2 b-jets; requiring 2 b-jets strongly\nsuppresses the selection of events in the low pW\nT range. After filtering on 2 b-jets the slope and normalisation of the\nPS and ME events agree relatively well, the normalisation\nratio being on the level of 1.5-2.5. A closer look (bottom\nplots) indicates a substantial enhancement of PS events in\nW\nthe range pW\nT = 40 \u2212 120 GeV. For much higher pT the\nME predictions start to exceed the PS ones.\nTable 1 quantifies the expected cross-sections for the\ninclusive production after requiring a reconstructed lbb\nfinal state. The PS predictions turn out to be 50-100%\nhigher than the ME ones but are still quite compatible\nfor events with the invariant mass of the b-jet system in\nthe range of interest. After requiring jet-veto, important\nfor selection of the W H channel to suppress the tt\u0304 background, the ME predictions agree with the PS ones in the\nmass range of interest. The numbers in this table illustrate that the slope of the invariant mass distribution of\nthe b-jet system and jet multiplicities is quite different for\ndifferent simulation approaches.\nFor the sake of the evaluation consistency, factorisation/renormalisation energy scale Q2 = m2W was used\nthroughout the ME and PS event generation. The factorisation/renormalisation scale dependence for this process\nis of the order of 20% at most, which was estimated by\nusing a range of different definitions of the energy scale\nimplemented in [6].\nThe fact that the overall normalisations differ, one can\nnaively interpret as an effect indicating that the effective\ncascade branching into heavy flavour quarks is more intense in PS events, quantitatively by almost a factor of\n1.5-2.5 higher. The feature was discussed in more detail\nin [9], the conclusions being that it rather reflects a sum\nof several effects, not just a simple enhancement in the\neffective cascade branching.\nIn Fig. 2 the distributions relevant for the experimental analyses are plotted for events with two reconstructed\nb-jets and one tagged lepton. One can observe that there\nis a significant difference in the predicted cone separation\n\n\f4\n\nB. P. Kersevan, E.

A better agreement is observed when a large cone separation between\nb-jets and the jet-veto on the additional jets are required.\nThis could be explained by the fact that after these requirements the topology of PS events comes closer to the\nME one. As the ME events exhibit lower average multiplicity for reconstructed jets than the PS events, the latter\nare suppressed stronger by the jet veto requirement and\nthus give cross-section predictions which are even lower\nthan the ones for ME events. The invariant mass distribution for ME events however remains harder than the\none for PS events. Please also note the effect of imposing\nRbb\u2212jets > 0.7 on the shape of the invariant mass distribution of the b-jet system, which shifts the distribution\nmaximum to about 40-60 GeV (compare Fig. 2 and 3).\nMore detailed discussions on the quantitative differences between PS and ME approaches for the q q\u0304 \u2192 W (\u2192\nl\u03bd)g(\u2192 bb\u0304) process can be found in [9].\n\n3 The Zbb\u0304 irreducible background\nFig. 2.

The parton shower approach predicts more events with a small cone separation.\nThese events can be rejected if a threshold on that separation is required. In fact, they are not contributing to\nthe higher range of the invariant mass of the b-jet pair.\nAs expected, the shapes of the transverse momenta of the\nindividual b-jets and of the b-jet system are also harder\nfor the ME events. Quite different is the slope of the invariant mass distribution of the b-jet system; for PS events\n1\n\nCone separation is calculated as the separation in the plane\nof\npseudorapidity\n(\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03c6), the Rbb\u2212jets =\np\n(\u2206\u03c6bb\u2212jets )2 + (\u2206\u03b7bb\u2212jets )2 .\n\nIn this section the estimates for the irreducible Zbb\u0304 background to the Higgs boson searches in the ZH production,\nfollowed by the H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay, are discussed. The evaluation is based on two simulation approaches, ME and PS,\nas specified below:\n\u2013 ME: Use the 2 \u2192 4 matrix element for gg, q q\u0304 \u2192\nZ/\u03b3 \u2217 (\u2192 ll)bb\u0304 process as implemented in AcerMC. The\n\u03c3 \u00d7 BR = 26.2 pb for single leptonic flavour Z/\u03b3 \u2217 decay and for the invariant mass of the lepton pair above\n60 GeV. This matrix element represents lowest order\ncontribution to the llbb\u0304 final state. The initial (ISR)\nand final state radiation (FSR) is simulated with parton shower of PYTHIA, followed by hadronisation to\ncomplete the event generation.\n\u2013 PS: Use the 2 \u2192 1 matrix element for q q\u0304 \u2192 Z/\u03b3 \u2217\nprocess as implemented in PYTHIA, followed by the\nISR. The \u03c3 \u00d7 BR = 1640 pb for single lepton flavour\ndecay and invariant mass of the lepton pair above\n60 GeV. Gluon splitting in the ISR partonic cascade\nis the source of b-quarks in the event. The implementation of this process includes ISR/FSR modeled with\nan improved parton shower approach [12], [13] which\nintegrates some higher-order corrections.\nThe study begins by comparing differential distributions of the Z-boson transverse momenta for both simulation approaches, see Fig. 4, after requiring reconstructed\nleptons and jets (b-jets) in the final state. With the generation threshold for the invariant mass of the lepton pair at\n60 GeV, the studied events are dominated by the on-shell\nZ-boson exchange.\nContrary to the W bb\u0304 case, the slopes of the pZ\nT distributions in the ME and PS events are very different; the ME\nevents are found to be much harder. One should remember\nthat there are several topologies of the Feynman diagrams\n\n\fB. P. Kersevan, E.

This might explain why in\nthis case the universal improved parton shower approximation implemented in PYTHIA for q q\u0304 \u2192 Z/\u03b3 \u2217 process is\nnot working as well as in the previous case of the q q\u0304 \u2192 W\nprocess and the lbb\u0304 events.\nThe overall normalisation prediction of both simulation streams, see Table 2, seems to be in reasonable agreement for llbb\u0304 events. This agreement remains after requiring lepton-pair and b-jet pair within the mass window, but\n\n5\n\nFig. 5.

In both generation approaches the factorisation/renormalisation energy\nscale Q2 = m2Z was used. Also in this case, the variation\nof the cross-section with the factorisation/renormalisation\nscales implemented in AcerMC is less than 20%.\nIn Fig. 5 the distributions relevant for the experimental\nanalyses are drawn. One can observe that, contrary to the\nprevious case, there is no significant difference in the cone\nseparation between b-jets (Rbb\u2212jets ) distribution. In both\nsimulation approaches the dominant fraction of events has\na b-jet pair with a large cone separation. This marks the\ntopology of llbb\u0304 process as quite different from lbb\u0304 events.\nFurthermore, the shapes of the transverse momenta of the\nindividual b-jets and of the b-jet system are in this case\nalso quite similar (compatible) for ME and PS events.\nSurprisingly similar, given the complexity of the topologies introduced by the Feynman diagrams, is the distribution of the invariant mass of the b-jet system in PS and\nME events. This is illustrated in Fig. 6. To illuminate this\nfurther, Fig. 7 shows the separate ME contributions from\nthe q q\u0304 and gg events to the total invariant mass spectrum\nof the b-jet system. One sees a distinctly different shape\nof both components; as expected the q q\u0304 component is very\nsimilar to the one of W bb\u0304 events. Nevertheless, the latter\nclass of events contributes only on the level of 10% to the\ntotal.\n\n\f6\n\nB. P. Kersevan, E.

Two generation approaches, ME and PS, which lead to the tt\u0304bb\u0304 final\nstate are considered.\n\u2013 ME: Use the 2 \u2192 4 matrix element for gg, q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304bb\u0304\nprocesses as implemented in [6]. For the QCD component the \u03c3\u00d7BR = 2.7 pb, with leptonic decay (electron\nor muon) of one W-boson and hadronic decay of the\nsecond one, both W bosons being produced in the top\ndecays. For the EW component, gg, \u2192 (Z/W/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192)bb\u0304,\nthe \u03c3 \u00d7 BR = 0.26 pb. These matrix elements represent the lowest order contribution to the tt\u0304bb\u0304 final\nstate. The interference between QCD and EW component is not available in the present implementation of\n[6]. In the numerical evaluation the central value of the\nfactorisation scale [17], Q2QCD = (mt + mH /2)2 , with\nmH = 120 GeV was used for the QCD component and\nthe Q2 = m2Z was used for electroweak one. For this\nprocess, as already stressed in [6], different choices of\nthe factorisation scale could lead to the cross-section\nestimates differing even by factor of four. Event gener-\n\nThere are two classes of processes which lead to the tt\u0304bb\u0304\nfinal state, the QCD and EW ones; for the corresponding\nFeynman diagrams see [6]. The PS events, where the hard\nprocess is just the top-quark pair production, contribute\nonly the QCD component. Consequently, only the QCD\nME component should be directly compared with the PS\none.\nAs an inclusive control distribution the transverse momenta spectra of the top quarks were chosen. Fig. 8 shows\nthat there is quite a good agreement between PS and ME\npredictions. With the factorisation energy scale used for\nevaluating the ME predictions the absolute normalisation\nagrees within 20% and the ratio of the PS and ME distributions is amazingly flat. For other choices of the factorisation energy scale, the ratio would be quite different (see\nTable with the total cross-sections in [6]), but subsequent\nchecks confirm that the distributions remain very similar.\nIn the proposed experimental analysis [5] both topquarks have to be reconstructed and the remaining two\nb-jets are than considered as possible candidates for the\nHiggs boson decay products. In the present study this selection procedure was replaced by the tight matching requirements of the b-jets and their partonic origin. These\nlead to a very clean separation between b-jets originating\nfrom the top-quarks and those which are not. In what follows only the distributions of the b-jets which are not\nidentified as originating from the top-quark decays are\nconsidered.\nIn Table 3 the expected total cross-sections and the\ncross-sections after simplified event selection are given.\nThe EW ME component is on the level of 10% of the\ntotal ME cross-section and on the level of 25% of all ME\nevents accepted in the mass window. The fact that the resonant electroweak background is not negligible makes the\nprospects for the observability more difficult, especially\nfor the Higgs boson masses closer to the mass of the Zboson. This mass range has been already excluded for the\nSM Higgs boson [3], but for the MSSM scenarios is still\nin the region of a possible discovery [4]. While resonant\nEW component was estimated some time ago as negligible in [2]2 , the non-resonant EW component was to our\nknowledge not considered prior to this study. It is clear\nthat the evaluation presented in [2] should be now revised\nto include the EW background properly.\n2\nIt was the consequence of the implementation for the QQ\u0304Z\nprocess in PYTHIA 5.7 generator used at that time, which was\nnot evaluating the total cross-section correctly.\n\n\fB.

Quite different are the shapes of the transverse\nmomenta of individual b-jets and of the b-jet system.

Nicely enough, the shape of the invariant\nmass distribution of the b-jet system is quite similar in the\nrelevant mass range, see Fig. 10. Moreover, the normalisations are in a satisfactory agreement in the relevant mass\n\n7\n\nFig. 9.

The presence of\nthe flat non-resonant component, which is quite substantial with respect to the resonant one, is rather evident.\nOne can also clearly see how the shape of the EW background is smeared when going from b-quark distribution\nto b-jet distribution.\nFinally the QCD and EW component of the ME simulation chain are added together. Fig. 12 again shows the\nrespective invariant mass distributions of the b-quark pair\n(top plot) and b-jet pair (bottom plots) in reconstructed\ntt\u0304bb\u0304 events.

The EW component contributes around 20-25% of\nthe QCD one in the mass range of interest.\nIt is crucial to notice that the EW component produces\na resonant structure above the non-resonant QCD+EW.\nThis will make a discovery of MSSM light Higgs in the tt\u0304bb\u0304\nchannel, with the mass between 95-110 GeV, even more\ndifficult than assumed in [2]. One should however keep\nin mind that the relative contribution of QCD and EW\n\u2217\n\nFig. 12.

Three processes were discussed: the W bb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 and\ntt\u0304bb\u0304 production. The AcerMC Monte Carlo generator was\nused for simulating ME events while PYTHIA 6.2 was used\nfor simulating PS events.\n\u2013 For the W bb\u0304 background there is a reasonable agreement of pW\nT spectra in lbb\u0304 events. Expected rates are\nhowever almost 1.5-2.5 higher in PS simulation. This\nenhancement comes mostly from configurations where\nb-jets are very close. Requiring large cone separation\nbetween b-jets and vetoing events with additional jets\nbrings the ME estimates to be in acceptable agreement\nfor the relevant invariant mass range of the b-jet system.\n\u2013 For the Zbb\u0304 background the PS approach is clearly underestimating the hardness of the tail of the pZ\nT spectra. This is due to the dominant contribution from the\nmultipheral Feynman diagrams, not reproduced well\neven with an improved parton shower implementation\n\n\fB. P. Kersevan, E. Richter-Wa\u0327s: What is the Wbb\u0304, Zbb\u0304 or tt\u0304bb\u0304 irreducible background . . .\n\nin PYTHIA. The distributions of the invariant mass of\nthe b-jet system and their normalisations are in reasonable agreement.\n\u2013 There are two components of the tt\u0304bb\u0304 background, the\nQCD and EW ones. Only the QCD component can\nbe simulated with the PS approach. For QCD PS and\nQCD ME events there is a relatively good agreement in\nthe shape and normalisation of the invariant mass distribution of the b-jet system. The transverse momenta\ndistribution of that system is however much harder\nin ME events. The EW ME component is not negligible and leads to the resonant structure in the total\nQCD+EW background. This would make observability of the mass range around the Z-boson mass more\ndifficult than hoped so far.\nIt is quite evident that well understood theoretical predictions for these processes will provide the key for establishing the Higgs signal observability; it is however difficult\nto draw universal conclusions from the comparisons presented above. Therefore, it is rather encouraging that the\nPS and LO ME predictions are not very far off. The 50%\ndifferences e.g. for W bb\u0304 events in the overall normalisation are still within expected uncertainties for this type of\nbackground estimates. It would nevertheless be very important to perform a similar comparison with NLO ME\npredictions. Such implementations are already becoming\navailable for W bb\u0304 events [18] and Zbb\u0304 events [19]. Nevertheless, at the time of the studies presented here, they\nwere still not in the form allowing for straightforward applicability.\nGiven several possible tunings of the parton shower\nmodel as presently available in PYTHIA, one could probably easily improve further on the agreement between both\napproaches. The framework prepared in AcerMC generator\ncould well be a nice tool for such a tedious task. It is however not clear, that the parameters should be tuned in a\nway to make the PS predictions agree with the ME ones.\nRather, an enhanced theoretical understanding for which\napplications the PS or ME predictions are more credible\nand why should be achieved first. We hope that the results\npresented here could contribute to such discussions.\nIndeed, most of the ME/PS comparison studies so far\nconcentrated predominantly on soft gluon emissions and/or\nNLO effects, where the hard processes under study are\nvery simple and/or unproblematic (e.g. Drell-Yan Z boson production, tt\u0304 production etc. . . ), whereas this study\nwas concentrated on the limiting case of processes involving either a large set of diagrams (from ME viewpoint)\nor quite hard gluon emission (from PS viewpoint). The\nlatter case might be even more problematic since the soft\n(NLO) effects have already been (to some extent) properly\nincorporated into the PS algorithms [12,13] whereas the\nhard gluon radiation (at high pT ) is a feature that might\nbe supposed not to work really well under PS approach\nby virtue of GLAP equations [20] and has received relatively little study so far. An additional point to support\nthis claim is that the fiducial kinematic cuts applied in\nthe above studies, which were chosen to reflect the cuts\nthat will be applied in the future experimental analyses,\n\n9\n\nto a certain extent suppress the soft (NLO) effects (e.g.\ncuts on minimal pT , minimal cone separation etc..). This\nmakes the discrepancies in the hard process description\nthe focal point of attention.\nThe issue of establishing a consistent procedure for the\nappropriate Monte Carlo generation [21] is crucial as the\ncomplete evaluation of the expected background should\ninclude its estimates for both irreducible and reducible3\ncomponents [5]. Quantifying the discrepancies between the\nME and PS simulation approaches is important because\nit indicates what could be the expected systematic bias\non the evaluation of the reducible backgrounds. The fact\nthat PS and ME predictions are not very far off in the discussed cases of the irreducible backgrounds is also encouraging for using PS approach for simulating their reducible\ncomponents.\nResults from the presented studies thus give us a stronger confidence in using the PS approach for simulating the\ncomplete backgrounds. The ME approach alone would be\nnot sufficient but is nevertheless very valuable for quantifying the uncertainties of the PS approach in case of the\nirreducible background components. The results however\nalso indicate that (for obvious reasons) the PS approach\nalone is also not without its shortcomings. Some contributions, like e.g. the full EW tt\u0304bb\u0304 can presently not be\ncovered by the PS algorithms. One should thus definitely\naim for having both approaches available in a form which\nis straightforward to use in the experimental analyses with\na clear theoretical understanding of their individual shortcomings.\nThis work was performed within the framework of the Higgs\nWorking Group of the ATLAS Collaboration. We are grateful\nto all our colleagues for the inspiring atmosphere and several\nvery valuable discussions. We have used a simplified version of\nthe fast simulation of the ATLAS detector for the quantitative\nevaluations of the detector responses presented in this paper.\n\nReferences\n1. D.
