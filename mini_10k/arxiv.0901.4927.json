The main test beam results\nof a stack of several MicroMegas prototypes fully comply with the needs of a hadronic\ncalorimeter for future particle physics experiments. A technical solution for a large\nscale prototype is also introduced.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFuture particle physics experiments at the International Linear Collider (ILC) [1] will employ\nthe Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA). In order to achieve an optimal PFA performance, a\nhighly granular hadronic calorimeter with a good shower separation is required. One of the\nsuitable and affordable choice for an active part of the hadronic calorimeter is a thin gaseous\ndetector with embedded digital (1-bit) or semi-digital (2-bit) readout. This concept allows\nthe construction of the so-called Digital Hardronic CALorimeter (DHCAL) with very fine\ngranularity (a cell size of about 1 cm2 ) providing high MIP efficiency, low hit multiplicity\nas well as negligible performance degradation due to high dose rates, hadronic showers and\naging.\nOne of the promising candidate for a DHCAL is the MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure\n(MicroMegas) which is a micro-pattern gaseous detector [2]. Prototypes developed at LAPP\nconsist of a commercially available 20 \u03bcm thin woven mesh which separates the 3 mm drift\ngap from the 128 \u03bcm amplification gap. This simple structure allows full efficiency for MIPs\nand provides a good gain uniformity over the whole detection area. Due to the fast collection\nof the amplification charge, the MicroMegas counting rate is very high and not constrained\nas in the case of the Glass RPC. Moreover, the tiny size of the amplification avalanche results\nin fast signals without physical cross talk and, consequently, low multiplicity. The chosen\nbulk technology based on industrial PCB processes, offers a robust large area detector with\nworking voltages lower than 500 V. The MicroMegas with 1 cm2 anode pads is therefore a\nvery appealing possibility to equip a DHCAL well optimized for the PFA.\n\n2\n\nMicroMegas Prototypes\n\nThree different kinds of MicroMegas prototypes with 1 cm2 pads, were developed and built\nat LAPP. The first type is equipped with analog readout and the two others with embedded\ndigital readout ASICs.\nThe analog readout, intended for full detector characterization, uses 16-channel GASSIPLEX chips connected to a 12 bit VME ADC, which provides charge determination with a\n\u2217 This\n\nwork was performed within the CALICE collaboration.\n\nLCWS/ILC 2008\n\n\fhigh resolution (0.4 fC/ADC Count). The data acquisition is performed by the CENTAURE\nprogram [3]. Three MicroMegas with 6 \u00d7 12 pads and one with 12 \u00d7 32 pads were equipped\nwith this analog readout.\nTwo mixed-signal ASICs are designed for the digital readout, the HARDROC [4] and\nDIRAC [5]. The former was chosen as a baseline for the 1 m3 European DHCAL project in\norder to ensure the availability of the digital readout of either MicroMegas or Glass RPC\nat short time. Whereas, the latter is a long-term R&D which aims to obtain a low cost\nASIC with an easy signal routing implementation on the detector PCB, simple calibration\nand digital readout down to MicroMegas MIP charges. Four MicroMegas with 8 \u00d7 32 pads\n(see Fig. 1 left) and one with 8 \u00d7 8 pads (see Fig. 1 right) were built with HARDROC and\nDIRAC readout, respectively.\n\nFigure 1: MicroMegas prototype with HARDROC (left) and DIRAC (right) readout. Both\nphotographs show the pad and ASICs sides.\nAll MicroMegas bulks are realized by lamination at high temperature of photosensitive\nfoils and a mesh laid on a PCB with different signal routing depending on the readout. By\nphoto-lithography, the photosensitive foils are etched producing the 128 \u03bcm pillars. A thin\ncopper foil, glued to part of the calorimeter absorber medium (2 mm thick plate out of a\n2 cm thick absorber), defines the drift cathode. The top of the chamber is therefore not\ncontributing to the active medium thickness. The drift gap is realized with a 3 mm thick\nframe which provides also the gas inlets and outlets.\n\n3\n\nX-ray response\n\nIn order to determine the gain and energy resolution, each prototype was exposed to an 55 Fe\nX-ray source. The gain with the analog readout was measured up to 10000 and the energy\nresolution down to 8.5% corresponding to a FWHM of 19.6%. The gain and FWHM were\nalso measured as a function of the drift and amplification fields, gas flow and pressure. The\nexpected exponential dependence on the gain on the amplification field was verified and an\nabsolute pressure dependence of -2 fC/mbar was determined.\nLCWS/ILC 2008\n\n\f4\n\nTest beam results\n\nThe behavior of the MicroMegas prototypes under high energy particle irradiation was\nstudied during two test beam periods at CERN. In the first period, four prototypes with\nanalog readout and one prototype with DIRAC digital readout were assembled in a stack\nand tested in 200 GeV muon and pion beams at the H2 SPS line. In the second period, four\nprototypes with digital readout based on the HARDROC chip with associated electronics\nwere exposed to 7 GeV pions at the T9 PS line. Since the analysis of data collected during\nthe second period is ongoing, only results obtained during the first period in summer 2008\nare presented below.\nThe mapping of each chamber was performed in terms of pedestal and electronic noise,\nMost Probable Value (MPV) of deposited energy distribution and its standard deviation.\nThe pedestal Gaussian distribution showed very good noise performance with an average\nnoise of 0.6 fC. A clear Landau distribution of deposited energy was obtained for each pad\nwith a MPV around 45 fC. The MPV is well uniform for all the chambers (see Fig. 2 left)\nwith an average dispersion of 11% RMS (see Fig. 2 right).\n\nFigure 2: Map of the MPV of deposited energy distribution for one chamber (left) and the\nrelative MPV distributions (right) for four MicroMegas prototypes with analog readout.\nFor efficiency and multiplicity studies, the hit threshold was set to 27 ADC Counts\n(2.8 fC). The counted hit in a chamber is considered only in case when three hits of three\nother chambers are sitting on the extrapolated straight line with respect to the chosen\nchamber. The efficiency of each pad is then computed as the ratio of the counted number of\nhits in the central or adjacent pad, so in a 3 \u00d7 3 pad array, and the expected number of hits.\nThe efficiency varies from (92, 99 \u00b1 0, 10)% to (97, 05 \u00b1 0, 07)% for the oldest and newest\nprototype showing considerable progress in the manufacturing process. The hit multiplicity\nis measured by counting the number of hits in the same pad array. A multiplicity smaller\nthan 1.1 was found for all of the four prototypes.\nIn the same test beam period, the first prototype with digital readout using DIRAC ASIC\nwas tested in a 200 GeV pion beam. The functionality of the prototype was verified by beam\nscanning across the chamber. Nevertheless, further tests with a stack of several prototypes\nare compulsory to measure threshold dependence, efficiency and multiplicity. These tests\nare foreseen for spring 2009.\nLCWS/ILC 2008\n\n\f5\n\nFuture developments\n\nThe next step is the development of a 1 m2 MicroMegas prototype with 9216 readout pads.\nThe 1 m2 is an assembly of six Active Sensor Units (ASUs) with 24 ASICs each closed by two\nplates of 2 mm thick stainless steel (see Fig. 3). In order to avoid destructive sparks from the\nincreased capacitance of a too large area mesh, one mesh per ASU will be used. The total\nthickness of the prototype should not exceed 6 mm (without absorber). The construction\nof such a 1 m2 prototype is scheduled for the beginning of 2009 and its first test in a beam\nfor late 2009. The 1 m2 design is foreseen for large quantity production in order to build a\n1 m3 DHCAL prototype.\n\nFigure 3: 1m2 MicroMegas prototype\n\n6\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nSeveral MicroMegas prototypes with analog and digital readout have been successfully built\nand tested. The summer 2008 test beam results have shown very good performance complying with the DHCAL requirements. The first operational bulk MicroMegas with embedded\ndigital electronics was realized and exposed to a pion beam. Further studies with a stack of\nthese new thin prototypes are foreseen. Development of a large scale prototype compatible\nwith the CALICE DAQ is well underway to be ready for a test beam in 2009.\n\nReferences\n[1] ILC Global Design Effort and World Wide Study, International Linear Collider Reference Design Report;\n[2] I.
