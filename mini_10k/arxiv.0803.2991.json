There is a variety of applications for CMLs to\nmodel hydrodynamical flows, turbulence, chemical reactions, biological systems, and quantum field theories (see\ne.g. reviews in [3, 4]). For hyperbolic maps with slope of\nthe local maps always larger than one a variety of analytical results exists [5, 6, 7, 8]. However, promising results\nhave been achieved also for the physically more interesting non-hyperbolic maps [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nLocal non-hyperbolic maps given by N -th order Chebyshev polynomials promise to answer a long-standing\nproblem of elementary particle physics, namely the mass\nspectrum of elementary particles. With surprizing evidence it could be shown that the self-energy of the chaotic\nstring, i.e. a one-dimensional lattice based on diffusely\ncoupled Chebyshev maps, shows a fine structure with\nminima that can be related to the fundamental mass\nparameters of the standard model of elementary particle physics [4, 13]. It was recently shown that this fine\nstructure disappears if we use a lattice of more than one\ndimension [17]. In addition the chaotic string can serve as\na useful model for vacuum fluctuations and dark energy\nin the universe [18].\nIt is interesting to know whether under special circumstances a long one-dimensional lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions can be replaced by a short one.\nDettmann et al. studied a string of length L = 2, i.e.\nthe case of two coupled Chebyshev maps [19] using periodic orbit theory. In this note we examine short strings\nwith periodic boundary conditions (closed strings) as well\nas strings with open ends (open strings) and fixed ends\n(fixed strings). Our central result is that closed strings of\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: groote@thep.physik.uni-mainz.de\naddress: hardi27@ut.ee\n\nlength L \u2265 3 as well as other short string configurations\nlead to the same self energy fine structure in the scaling\nregion (i.e. for the coupling close to zero) as for the case\nof maps with rather long lengths (L = 10 000). This fact\nsupports hopes for understanding the reason for the fine\nstructure in the scaling region.\n\nII.\n\nAPPROACHING THE SCALING REGION\n\nIn this note we consider the CML given by the coupled\nChebyshev map system\n\u03c6n+1\n= (1 \u2212 a)T2 (\u03c6ni ) +\ni\n\n\u0001\na\nT2 (\u03c6ni+1 ) + T2 (\u03c6ni\u22121 )\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is denoted as 2A-string in Ref. [4]. The index n\ncounts the iterations while i names the position on the\none-dimensional string. We are calling these numbers the\ntemporal and the spatial position. Periodic boundary\nconditions close the string by implying \u03c6nL+1 = \u03c6n1 where\nL is the string length. a is the coupling and T2 (\u03c6) is the\nsecond order Chebyshev polynomial\nT2 (\u03c6) = 2\u03c62 \u2212 1.\n\n(2)\n\nIt can be shown that in the scaling region (a small) the\n2B-string (with the last two Chebyshev polynomials in\nEq. (1) replaced by identities) has the same behaviour.\nThe self energy of the chaotic string is the temporal\nand spatial average\n2\nhV (\u03c6)ia = h\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 i.\n3\n\n(3)\n\nIt is obtained by performing the map (1) iteratively and\ntaking the average over all values \u03c6ni on the string. Obviously, the precision of the result is growing with the\nproduct of the number of iterations and the length of the\n(closed) string. The self energy depends on the coupling\na in a non-obvious way. In Fig. 1 we show the self energy\nfor a closed string of length L = 10 000, a closed string\nof length L = 3, and an open string of length L = 4.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Self energy of a closed 2A-string of length L = 10 000\n(solid line), a closed 2A-string of length L = 3 (dashed), and\nan open 2A-string of length L = 4 (dotted) for a \u2208 [0, 1]\n\nFIG. 2: Self energy of the 2A-string of length L = 10 000 in\nthe range a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006] after 10 000 iterations\n\nIV.\n\nThe latter is given by the map (1) for i = 2, 3 combined\nwith \u03c6n+1\n= T2 (\u03c6n1 ) and \u03c6n+1\n= T2 (\u03c6n4 ). The boundary\n1\n4\nvalues are not influenced but themselves influence the\ncentral value. Because of the ergodicity of the Chebyshev map they are distributed according to the invariant\nprobability density[20]\n\u03c10 (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c0\n\n1\np\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03c62\n\n(4)\n\nLooking at Fig. 1 we see that close to a = 0 the differences between the three results seem to vanish. For larger\nvalues of a the self energy of the closed string of length\nL = 3 disagrees to positive values, the self energy of the\nopen string to negative values. The noticeable disagreement between the closed strings for length L = 10 000\nand L = 3 close to a = 0.04 is due to the formation of\nstable orbits on the short string. A detailed analysis of\nthe interval a \u2208 [0.039, 0.043] shows that stable orbits\nof different periods interchange with chaotic behaviour.\nHowever, we do not dwell on this point here because the\nvalue a = 0.04 is still considered to be outside of the\nscaling region.\nIII.\n\nFINE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF ENERGY\n\nThe name \"scaling region\" for the region close to a = 0\nis due to the fact that we observe the scaling behaviour\n\u221a\nhV (\u03c6)ia \u2212 hV (\u03c6)i0 = f (N ) (ln a) a\n(5)\nwhere f (N ) is a periodic function of ln a with period\nln N 2 [4]. Using perturbative methods, this scaling behaviour could be shown in Refs. [15, 16]. Looking at a\nsingle period for the 2A-string (i.e. N = 2) we observe a\nfine structure of the self energy which is not yet fully understood. However, the local minima of the self energy\ncould be shown to be related to Yukawa and gravitational couplings for all quark and lepton flavours modulo\nN 2 = 4. Therefore, the fine structure of the self energy\nas shown in Fig. 2 is of central interest for us.\n\nCLOSED STRING OF LENGTH L = 2\n\nIf we reduce the string length to two points as in\nRef. [19] by keeping the periodic boundary conditions we\nobserve a quite different shape of the self energy (Fig. 3).\nA fine structure is still visible but is different from the\none for the long string. Relative minima are reallocated\nand, therefore, are not related to physical parameter values. The self-similar structure is much more evident as in\nthe other cases. The enhancement close to a \u2248 0.000577\n(similar to the one for the closed string of length L = 3\nnear a = 0.04) is caused by stable orbits interchanged\nwith chaotic behaviour. At a = 0.0005768 for instance\nwe find an orbit of period 6 which reads\n+ 0.7070\n+0.0003\n\u22120.9989\n+0.9954\n+0.9811\n+0.9238\n\n+0.9954\n+0.9811\n+0.9238\n+0.7070\n+0.0003\n\u22120.9989\n\n(6)\n\nThe deviation between the fine structures in Figs. 2 and 3\ncan be measured by the mean value of the differences of\nthe self energy value mediated over a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.00060]\nwhich is given by (\u22121.2 \u00b1 10.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 . The distribution function of this difference measured on the interval\na \u2208 [0.00015, 0.00060] differs very much from a Gaussian\ndistribution function (cf. Fig. 4). While the large standard deviation is due to the orbit region, the shape of\nthe distribution function and the large value of the order\nof 10\u22123 for the mean value indicates the visible deviation\nof the two fine structures.\n\nV.\n\nCLOSED STRING OF LENGTH L = 3\n\nIf we are looking at the closed string of length L = 3,\nwe observe that the fine structure is recovered (Fig. 5).\nThe mean value of the differences (0.2 \u00b1 4.4) \u00d7 10\u22125 is\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Self energy of the 2A-string of length L = 2 with periodic boundary conditions in the range a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006],\nthe number of iterations being 3 \u00d7 107\n\nFIG. 5: Self energy of the 2A-string of length L = 3 with periodic boundary conditions in the range a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006],\nthe number of iterations being 6 \u00d7 107\n\nFIG. 4: Distribution function for the difference values of the\nself energies of the closed strings for L = 2 and L = 10 000\nmediated over the intervall a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006]\n\nFIG. 6: Distribution function for the difference values of the\nself energies of the closed strings for L = 3 and L = 10 000\nmediated over the intervall a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006]\n\nquite small. The standard deviation is due to statistical\nerrors which could be reduced by calculating the two fine\nstructures to higher accuracy. Finally, the distribution\nfunction is very much of the shape of a Gaussian curve\n(Fig. 6). The same is true for other closed strings of short\nlength, for instance for a string consisting of L = 4 or\nL = 6 points (mean difference values are (0.3\u00b16.6)\u00d710\u22125\nand (0.2 \u00b1 5.7) \u00d7 10\u22125 , resp.).\n\nis recovered again (mean difference (1.6 \u00b1 6.2) \u00d7 10\u22125 ).\nIn both cases we observe some scattered points which\ndeviate from the main distribution. An analysis shows\nthat unlike the case of closed strings, these points do not\nrepresent stable orbits. Instead, their occurence depends\non the starting conditions and would vanish if we sum\nover a sufficient large set of random starting values.\n\nVI.\n\nSHORT OPEN STRINGS\n\nIf we replace the perodic boundary conditions by the\nopen string boundary conditions (map (1) for i 6= 1, L\ntogether with \u03c6n+1\n= T2 (\u03c6n1 ) and \u03c6n+1\n= T2 (\u03c6nL )), we\n1\nL\nobtain a different picture (cf. Fig. 7). The open string\nof length L = 3 corresponds to the perturbative settings\ngiven in Refs. [15, 16]. A fine structure is visible but is\nagain different from the one for the closed string. This\nfact is indicated also by the mean difference (1.6 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7\n10\u22123 and the distribution function which is divided up\ninto two maxima. However, if we use an open string\nof length L = 4 (Fig. 8), the original pattern of Fig. 2\n\nVII.\n\nSHORT FIXED STRINGS\n\nA final analysis is devoted to a one-dimensional map\nlattice with border values set to \u03c6n1 = \u03c6nL = 0 (fixed\nstring). The first reoccurence of the characteristic fine\nstructure is obtained for the fixed string of length L = 5\nfor the central value of this string (i = 3). The neighboured points (i = 2, 4) also show a fine structure but\nmore of the kind we were used to from the closed string\nof length L = 2. Both fine structures are shown in Fig. 9.\n\n\f4\nreproduced. Using an open string of short length it figures out that the fine structure is reproduced for a string\nof length L \u2265 4. Finally, the central points of a string of\nlength L \u2265 5 with fixed ends shows again the same fine\nstructure of the self energy. We conclude that the closed\nstring of length L = 3, the open string of length L = 4,\nor the fixed string of length L = 5 are minimal requirements for understanding the origin of the fine structure\nof the self energy dependence on the coupling a in the\nscaling region.\n\nFIG. 7: Self energy of the 2A-string of length L = 3 with open\nends in the range a \u2208 [0.00015, 0.0006] after 6 \u00d7 107 iterations\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank C.
