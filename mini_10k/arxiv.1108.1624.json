The\nIQH effect can be understood in terms of independent\nelectrons filling Landau levels, with the extremely precise\nquantization of the Hall conductance explained by gauge\ninvariance and the existence of a mobility gap [3] or, more\nrigorously, by a topological invariant called the Chern\nnumber [4, 5]. Laughlin provided the phenomenological\nexplanation for FQH states with filling \u03bd = 1/m (with\nm odd) in terms of quantum fluids, for which he provided highly accurate trial wavefunctions [6]. Laughlin's\nstates possessed exotic new features, such as topological order [7] and quasiparticle excitations with fractional\ncharge [6] and braiding statistics [8]. Soon after Laughlin's proposal, Haldane and Halperin proposed the hierarchy theory [9\u201311] of similar states built on Laughlin states\nto explain the FQH effect at other odd-denominator filling fractions which were being discovered. Later, the\ncomposite fermion (CF) theory was proposed by Jain as\nan alternative description of these FQH states [12].\nThe CF description has been particularly successful\nbecause it provides a superficially simple physical picture of the FQH effect, a straightforward phenomenology\nthat matches well with experiments, and trial wavefunctions which extensive numerical studies have found to\nbe highly accurate and which permit certain computations for relatively large system sizes (N \u223c 100); see,\ne.g. [13], for a review. CF theory also provides a conceptual context for the \u03bd = 1/2 Fermi-liquid-like state [14].\nIn contrast, the same range of phenomenology has not\nbeen as easy to elicit from the Haldane-Halperin (HH)\nhierarchy theory. Numerical studies of hierarchy generated wavefunctions are far less extensive, but have found\nthem to also be highly accurate [15]. It has been argued that the HH hierarchy and CF states at the same\n\n\u03bd are simply descriptions of the same universality class,\nsince they possess identical topological quantum numbers, such as their quasiparticles' charge and braiding\nstatistics [16]. In contrast, it has also been argued that\nthe CF theory, which views the FQH states as IQH states\nof composite fermions, is fundamentally different from\nthe hierarchy theory and that there is no hierarchical\nrelation between different filling fractions in the CF theory, since there is none between different integer filled\nstates (see, e.g. Ch. 12.1 of [13]). In Refs. [17\u201319], it was\nshown, working on the plane, that applying the hierarchical construction for specifically designed quasiparticle\ntrial wavefunctions exactly produces CF wavefunctions.\nThese quasiparticle wavefunctions, which are generated\nvia conformal field theory operators, are equivalent to CF\ngenerated quasiparticle wavefunctions, up to ambiguities\nand freedoms associated with defining wavefunctions of\nboth approaches on the plane [20, 21].\nIn this letter, I consider hierarchical constructions for\nquantum Hall systems on the (2D) sphere [9], where the\nrelevant wavefunctions are more precisely defined than\non the plane. I apply the hierarchy theory to the \u03bd = n\nIQH states [32] to produce \u03bd = n + \u03bd\u0303 states, where 0 <\n\u03bd\u0303 \u2264 1 is the filling of a quantum Hall state into which\nthe quasielectrons are projected. The resulting \u03bd = n + \u03bd\u0303\nwavefunctions are exactly those of states with Landau\nlevels 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 filled and the filling \u03bd\u0303 quantum Hall\nstate in the nth Landau level. This is used to explicitly\ndemonstrate the hierarchical nature of the IQH effect and\nof the CF theory of the FQH effect. In the supplementary\nmaterial (following the letter), I provide details to repeat\nthis analysis for planar systems and address associated\nissues.\nIn the hierarchy theory [9\u201311], one starts from a wavefunction \u03a8 (R\u03bc ; ri ) for a state of N electrons with coordinates r1 , . . . , rN that has Nqp quasiparticles at positions\nR1 , . . . , RNqp . Then the quasiparticles are projected onto\na quantum Hall type state with (pseudo-)wavefunction\n\u03a6 (R\u03bc ) (by taking the inner product with respect to the\n\n\f2\nquasiparticles' coordinates), giving the wavefunction for\na new electronic state\n\u03a8\u2032 (ri ) =\n\nZ N\nqp\nY\n\nd2 R\u03bc \u03a6 (R\u03bc ) \u03a8 (R\u03bc ; ri ) .\n\n(1)\n\nPj\u22121\n(j)\nwhere Nj = r=0 Nr , and \u03c71 is the wavefunction for a\nfilled jth LL, given by\n(j)\n\n\u03c71 (ra ) =\n\nThe wavefunction \u03a6 must be suitably chosen so that the\nintegrand is single-valued and hence well-defined. This\nhierarchy construction can be associated with the physical picture where an additional quantum Hall fluid is\nintroduced and coupled to the original one by bose condensing composites of quasiparticles (which, in general,\nare anyonic) from the two Hall fluids that form electrically neutral bosons. Such a topological bose condensation produces a new topological phase from the previous\ntwo [22]. Requiring that a neutral boson composite of\nquasiparticles can be formed provides precisely the same\nrestriction on the allowed Hall fluid that may be added\nand hence its associated wavefunctions \u03a6, as does the\nsingle-valued integrand requirement.\nThe electron positions on the sphere are expressed using spinor coordinates ri = (ui , vi ), which are related to\nspherical coordinates (\u03b8i , \u03c6i ) by\nvi = sin (\u03b8i /2) e\u2212i\u03c6i /2 .\n\nui = cos (\u03b8i /2) ei\u03c6i /2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nIn spherical quantum Hall systems, a radial magnetic\n~N\nfield B = 2eR\u03c62 r\u0302 is produced by a magnetic monopole at\nthe center of the sphere, corresponding to N\u03c6 flux quanta\npassing through the surface (in units of \u03c60 = h/e). The\nnumber of flux is related to the filling fraction \u03bd by\nN\u03c6 = \u03bd \u22121 N \u2212 S, where the shift S is a topological quantum number (for clean systems) characteristic of how the\nelectrons couple to spatial curvature in different quantum\nHall states [23]. There are Nj = N\u03c6 + 2j + 1 orbitals in\nthe jth LL given by the monopole harmonics [24], which\nform a complete, orthogonal basis. In spinor coordinates,\nthese (single particle) orthonormal basis states are\n(j)\n(r) =\n\u03c8s,m\n\n\b\n(2s + 1) (2s \u2212 j)!\nLj us+m v s\u2212m\n4\u03c0 (s + m)! (s \u2212 m)!j!\n\n(3)\nwhere j = 0, 1, . . . specifies the LL, s = 12 N\u03c6 + j corresponds to the eigenvalue s (s + 1) of total angular momentum L2 for orbitals in the jth LL, m = \u2212s, \u2212s +\n1, . . . , s is the eigenvalue of Lz (specifying the orbital\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u016b \u2202v\nis the LL raising\nwithin the jth LL), and L = v\u0304 \u2202u\noperator.\nThus, a system filling the n lowest Landau levels (j =\n0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1) has N\u03c6 = n1 N \u2212 n and is described by the\n(unnormalized) wavefunction\n\u03c3 n\u22121\nY\n\nX (\u22121)\n\u03c7n (ri ) =\nN!\n\u03c3\u2208SN\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4 \u2208SNj\n\n\u03bc=1\n\ns\n\nNj\nX (\u22121)\u03c4 Y\n\u0001\n(j)\n\u03c8sj ,sj \u2212a+1 r\u03c4 (a) ,\nNj ! a=1\n\nj=0\n\nwhere sj = 12 N\u03c6 + j.\nIn order to introduce Nqe quasielectrons in the \u03bd = n\nstate (for which such localized point-like excitations have\ncharge \u2212e and fermionic statistics), one decreases the flux\nby 1/n for each quasielectron to N\u03c6 = n1 N \u2212 n \u2212 n1 Nqe .\nThis decreases the number of orbitals in each LL and\nforces electrons to occupy LLs above the (n \u2212 1)th. To\nform minimal uncertainty excitations that are maximally\nlocalized at specific points, one uses coherent states.\nThus, the minimal energy quasielectrons are coherent\n(n)\nstates in the nth LL. The coherent state \u03c6sn ,R (r) in the\nnth LL on the sphere, localized at the point R = (\u03b1, \u03b2)\n(in spinor coordinates) is obtained by applying Ln to the\n0th LL coherent state [9, 25], which (with a preferred\nnormalization) yields\ns\n\u00012sn o\n2sn + 1 (2sn \u2212 n)! n n\n(n)\nL\n\u1fb1u + \u03b2\u0304v\n\u03c6sn ,R (r) =\n4\u03c0\n(2sn )!n!\n=\n\nr\u03c3(Nj +aj )\n\n\u0001\n\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c8sn ,m (R) \u03c8s(n)\n(r) .\nn ,m\n\n(6)\n\nm=\u2212sn\n\nThus, the N electron wavefunction for this state with\nNqe quasielectrons localized at positions R\u03bc = (\u03b1\u03bc , \u03b2\u03bc ),\nwhere \u03bc = 1, . . . , Nqe , is given (for Nqe \u2264 Nn ) by\n\u03a8n (R\u03bc ; ri ) =\n\nY (j)\nX (\u22121)\u03c3 n\u22121\n\u0001\n\u03c71 r\u03c3(Nj +aj )\nN ! j=0\n\n\u03c3\u2208SN\n\nNqe\n\n\u00d7\n\nY\n\n(n)\n\n\u03c6sn ,R\u03bc r\u03c3(Nn +\u03bc)\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n\u0001\n\n(7)\n\nwhere this uses new values of Nj and sj corresponding\nto N\u03c6 = n1 N \u2212 n \u2212 n1 Nqe .\nThe next step in the hierarchy construction is projecting the quasielectrons of this wavefunction into another\nquantum Hall type wavefunction \u03a6 (R\u03bc ) for the quasielectrons, as in Eq.

The wavefunction \u03a8\u2032n+\u03bd\u0303 (ri ) is exactly that of a \u03bd = n + \u03bd\u0303 state of\nN electrons with Landau levels 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 filled and\n\u03a8\u0303\u03bd\u0303 partially filling the nth Landau level. It should also\nbe clear that this mapping is invertible, i.e. the wavefunction \u03a8\u0303\u03bd\u0303 can be uniquely obtained from \u03a8\u2032n+\u03bd\u0303 .\nProjecting the quasielectrons onto the (conjugate of)\na filled LL, i.e. using \u03a6 (R\u03bc ) = \u03c71 (R\u03bc ) in Eq. (1) of the\nhierarchy construction, produces \u03a8\u2032n+1 (ri ) = \u03c7n+1 (ri ),\nthe wavefunction for the state with the n + 1 lowest LLs\nfilled. Thus, I have explicitly demonstrated that the IQH\nstates possess a hierarchical structure.\n\u2217\nThe CF theory generates \u03bd = 2p\u03bd\u03bd\u2217 \u00b11 FQH states\nby viewing them as filling \u03bd \u2217 quantum Hall states of\nCFs [12], which are bound states of electrons with \u00b12p\nquantized vortices. The associated ground-state trial\nwavefunction generated from that of a \u03bd \u2217 state with\nwavefunction \u03a8\u03bd \u2217 is [33]\n\u03a8\u03bd (ri ) = [\u03c71 (ri )]\n\n2p\n\n\u03a8\u00b1\u03bd \u2217 (ri )\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03a8\u2212\u03bd \u2217 (ri ) = \u03a8\u03bd \u2217 (ri ) corresponds to using negative\nvortices. In particular, the experimentally prominent sen\ncorresponding to \u03bd \u2217 = n\nries of FQH states \u03bd = 2pn\u00b11\nare thought of as IQH states of CFs. The other odddenominator filling fractions are generated in the CF picture using \u03bd \u2217 = n+ \u03bd\u0303, where the filling fraction 0 < \u03bd\u0303 < 1\nis that of a previously obtained state (or its particle-hole\n4\nconjugate), e.g. \u03bd \u2217 = 4/3 gives \u03bd = 8p\u00b13\n, which is relevant for the observed \u03bd = 4/11 state [26] (see Ch. 7.4\nof [13] for more details). From this perspective, it is now\nobvious that the CF description of FQH states is hierarchical in nature, just as the IQH and \u03bd = n + \u03bd\u0303 FQH\nstates are hierarchical in nature.\n\nIt is also worth examining the direct application of the\nhierarchy construction to the trial wavefunctions generated from the CF picture (rather than to the IQH states)\nin order to clarify the details of how the construction\nn\ntransfers over. Here, I will focus on the \u03bd = 2pn+1\nstates.\nI stress that the hierarchy picture applies to universality\nclasses of quantum Hall states and is not immutably restricted to specific choices of their representative trial\nwavefunctions. One should, however, try to employ the\nmost accurate trial wavefunctions \u03a6 (R\u03bc ) and \u03a8 (R\u03bc ; ri )\nthat one can produce and utilize for Eq. (1). The quasielectron trial wavefunctions generated by the CF picture\nare very accurate, so it is natural to use them in the hiern\narchical construction. The CF ansatz for the \u03bd = 2pn+1\nstates [starting from the \u03bd = 1/m = 1/(2p + 1) Laughlin\nstates at n = 1, which have trial wavefunctions \u03c7m\n1 ] with\nquasielectrons is generated similar to Eq. (12), but using\nthe wavefunction \u03a8n (R\u03bc ; ri ) of Eq. (7) for IQH states\ncontaining quasielectrons. This gives\n\u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri ) = [\u03c71 (ri )]2p \u03a8n (R\u03bc ; ri ) .\n\n(13)\n\nBefore inserting this wavefunction into the hierarchy\nmachinery, it is important to notice that, as written,\nits norm has nontrivial R\u03bc dependence, i.e. it is not\njust a constant (up to corrections that are exponentially\nsuppressed with the separation of quasielectrons). Additionally, explicit transformation of this wavefunction\nupon exchanging quasielectrons results in a factor of \u22121\ncorresponding to the fermionic statistics of quasiparticles in the \u03a8n states, rather than the phase ei\u03b8 , where\n2p\nis the braiding statistical angle of quasi\u03b8/\u03c0 = 1 \u2212 2pn+1\nelectrons in the \u03a8\u03bd state. (The correct braiding statistics is recovered once the Berry's phase contribution is\nincluded.) The properly normalized wavefunction that\nexplicitly exhibits the braiding statistics is\n\u03a8\u0302\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri ) =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03c71 (R\u03bc )\n|\u03c71 (R\u03bc )|\n\n\u0015 \u03c0\u03b8 \u22121\n\n\u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri )\n.\nk\u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri )k\n\n(14)\n\nIf one uses \u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri ) in the hierarchical construction\nof Eq. (1) and projects the quasielectrons into a Laughlin type quantum Hall state, then the natural (though\nperhaps na\u0131\u0308ve) choice for the wavefunction into which\nthe quasielectrons are projected would be \u03a6 (R\u03bc ) =\n2k\u22121\n\n[\u03c71 (R\u03bc )]\n, for k a positive integer. This exactly\nreproduces the CF generated FQH trial wavefunctions\nn\n(with k = 1 giving the \u03bd = 2pn+1\nstates) as it reduces\n2p\n\nto multiplying [\u03c71 (ri )] by the \u03bd = n + \u03bd\u0303 wavefunction\n1\n. In this way, one can hierar\u03a8\u2032n+\u03bd\u0303 (ri ) with \u03bd\u0303 = 2k\u22121\nchically generate all the CF ground-state trial wavefunctions, starting from the \u03bd = 1/m Laughlin states' trial\nwavefunctions.\nHowever, it may seem more appropriate to use\n\u03a8\u0302\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri ) in the hierarchical construction, since it explicitly manifests the physical correlation and statistics\n\n\f4\nproperties of the quasielectrons. In this case, the natural choice for projecting into a Laughlin type state is\n2k\u2212 \u03b8\n\n\u03c0\n. The detailed wavefunctions re\u03a6\u0302 (R\u03bc ) = [\u03c71 (R\u03bc )]\nsulting from these two constructions are generally different. To produce exactly the same wavefunctions,\none must either multiply \u03a6\u0302 or divide \u03a6 by the factor\n\u03b8\n\u22121\nf (R\u03bc ) = |\u03c71 (R\u03bc )| \u03c0 k\u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri )k.\nFor the sake of producing wavefunctions, one can introduce factors like f (R\u03bc ) into Eq. (1) at will, since it\nleaves the integral well-defined. In fact, one can view\nthe inclusion of such factors as variational parameters\nof the trial wavefunctions [19, 27]. However, if one demands strict adherence to the physical hierarchy picture\nwith \u03a8 and \u03a6 accurately describing quantum Hall states,\nthen one must be more careful and justify that such factors do not alter the universal properties of the wavefunctions. This is a very credible claim for the factors\nf (R\u03bc ) needed to exactly equate the detailed forms of\nthe above wavefunctions. In particular, from the similarities with the analogous quasihole wavefunctions, one\n1\u2212 \u03b8\nexpects k\u03a8\u03bd (R\u03bc ; ri )k = |\u03c71 (R\u03bc )| \u03c0 up to corrections\nthat are exponentially suppressed with the separation of\nquasielectrons. This property can be demonstrated for\nquasiholes in the Laughlin and the quasihole-based HH\nhierarchy states using the plasma analogy [6, 28]. Assuming this expected property for quasielectrons, it follows\nthat f (R\u03bc ) \u2248 1 except possibly when the quasielectrons\nare near each other, which is precisely where the relevant\nwavefunctions vanish and hence have negligible contribution to the integrals. Consequently, including the factor\nf (R\u03bc ) in the hierarchical construction should not significantly modify the resulting wavefunctions nor alter\ntheir universal properties. Refs. [17\u201319] tacitly use such\narguments in their hierarchical construction of the CF\nwavefunctions.\nIn summary, I have demonstrated that the IQH and\n\u03bd = n+ \u03bd\u0303 FQH states are hierarchical in nature. Through\nits fundamental relation to these states, the CF description of FQH states shares the same hierarchical nature.\nI also demonstrated the hierarchical structure of the CF\nFQH states directly through application of the hierarchy\nconstruction to Laughlin and CF trial wavefunctions, using quasielectron wavefunctions generated from the CF\npicture. As such, one may view the CF descriptions of\nFQH states as particularly successful representatives of\nthe HH hierarchy theory. One can now obtain the sought\nafter phenomenology of the HH hierarchy theory for FQH\nstates by simply adopting that of the CF theory.\nIt is also possible to construct hierarchies over nonAbelian quantum Hall states [29]. When these are formed\nstarting with Laughlin type quasiparticles (i.e. flux \u00b11\nexcitations that occur purely in the charge sector) in\nthese states, they also admit a description by CF type\nwavefunctions [29\u201331]. The results of this letter also apply to these cases.\n\nI thank B. A. Bernevig, T. H. Hansson, J. K. Jain,\nC. V. Nayak, and especially J. K. Slingerland for illuminating discussions and comments.

(On the other hand, one might argue that such\na truncation is unnecessary as long as the quasiparticle\ncoordinates R\u03bc remain \"inside\" the area of the disk of\nquantum Hall fluid, since then the coherent states will\nhave Gaussian suppressed support in the orbitals with\nm \u2265 M , which are considered to be \"outside\" the disk.)\nA truncated nth LL coherent state written as\ntr(n)\n\n\u03c6R\n\n(r) =\n\nM\u22121\nX\n\n(n)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c8m (R) \u03c8m\u2212n (r)\n\n(23)\n\nThe effect of these normalization factors is that the\nexpansion coefficients of \u03a8\u0303\u03bd\u0303 are modified by the hierarchy\nstep to become\nNqe\n\nC[trm ,...,m ] = C[m1 ,...,mN ]\n1\nNqe\nqe\n\ntr(n)\n\u03c6R\n\n(r)\n\n(n)\n\n2\n\n|R|\n1 \u0393 M, 2\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u0393 (M )\n\nin contrast with \u03c6sn ,R (r)\n(n)\n\u03c6R\n\n2\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n2\n\n=\n\n2sn +1\n4\u03c0\n\n(25)\n\ngm (M ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f9 12\n\u0393\n(M\n)\n(0)\n\u0011\uf8fb .\nd2 R \u03c8m\n(R) \uf8f0 \u0010\n2\n\u0393 M, |R|\n2\n2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n(26)\n\nThus, the nth LL component of the resulting hierarchical\nwavefunction becomes\n\nhas an R-dependent norm\n\u0011\n2\n\ngm\u03bc (M ),\n\n\u03bc=1\n\nwhere\n\nm=0\n\n\u0010\n\nY\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nfor the sphere and\n\nfor the plane.
