In this paper we prove the Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture for quasihomogeneous linear systems of multiplicity 6 on P2 . For the proof we use the degeneration\nof the plane by Ciliberto and Miranda and results by Laface, Seibert, Ugaglia and Yang.\nAs an application we derive a classification of the special systems of multiplicity 6.\n\n1. Introduction\nA classical problem in algebraic geometry is the dimensionality problem for plane curves,\nwhich can be formulated as follows. Given finitely many general points of the projective\nplane with assigned multiplicities and a number d, determine the dimension of the linear\nsystem of curves of degree d having at the given points at least the assigned multiplicities.\nMore precisely, the problem is to classify all systems which fail to have the expected\ndimension (see [C00] for some remarks on the history of this problem and its geometric\nmeaning). Harbourne and Hirschowitz conjecture that these special systems are precisely\nthe (\u22121)-special systems. In this paper, we give a complete list of the (\u22121)-special systems\nin the case in which the assigned multiplicity is 6 at all but one of the given points. Our\nmain result is the proof of the Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture in this case.\nWe proceed along the following lines. In Section 2 we introduce the necessary notation\nand give a precise statement of the Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture. In Section 3 we\npresent a list of the (\u22121)-special linear systems in our case. Its completeness is proved in\nSection 4. In Section 5 we review the degeneration of the plane by Ciliberto and Miranda.\nThis method is the key tool in our proof of the main result which is given in the final two\nsections.\n2. The Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture\nWe work over the complex numbers and choose n + 1 general points p0 , p1 , . . . , pn in P2 ,\nthe projective plane over that field.\n2.1 Notation\nWe write L = L(d, m0 , m1 , . . . , mn ) \u2282 P(\u0393(P2 , OP2 (d))) for the linear system of all curves\nof degree d in P2 having multiplicity at least mi at pi for all i. We denote by l(L) its\nprojective dimension.\nLet P\u2032 be the blow-up of P2 at p0 , p1 , . . . , pn . By H we denote the pull-back of a line\nin P2 and by Ei the exceptional divisor over pi . The dimension of L is the same as the\ndimension of |D| on P\u2032 with D = dH \u2212 m0 E0 \u2212 m1 E1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 mn En . Using cohomology\non P\u2032 , we have\nl(L) = h0 (OP\u2032 (D)) \u2212 1.\nTherefore we have by Riemann-Roch\nl(L) =\n\nD.(D \u2212 KP\u2032 )\n+ h1 (OP\u2032 (D)) \u2212 h2 (OP\u2032 (D)) + \u03c7(OP\u2032 ) \u2212 1\n2\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\n(KP\u2032 denotes the canonical divisor on P\u2032 ). Since the arithmetic genus of P\u2032 is zero, Serre\nduality implies\nD.(D \u2212 KP\u2032 )\nl(L) =\n+ h1 (OP\u2032 (D)).\n2\n2.2 Definition\nWe define the virtual dimension v(L) of L as follows:\nv(L) =\n\nD.(D \u2212 KP\u2032 )\n.\n2\n\nWe define the expected dimension to be\nPn\n\ne(L) = max{\u22121, v(L)}.\n\n\u2212 i=0 mi (m2i +1) , one sees that the expected dimension is the one we\nAs v(L) = d(d+3)\n2\nobtain if all conditions imposed on the base points are independent.\nWe define L to be special or non-regular if\nl(L) > e(L),\notherwise we call L non-special or regular.\nWe recall some definitions from [CM98]:\n2.3 Definition ((\u22121)-special systems)\nLet A in P2 be an irreducible curve such that its strict transform \u00c3 in P\u2032 is rational and\nsmooth. Then A is a (-1)-curve if the self-intersection number\n\u00c32 = \u22121.\nBy L.A we denote the intersection number D.\u00c3 on P\u2032 .\nThe linear system L is called (-1)-special if\n\u2022 there exist A1 , . . . , At (\u22121)-curves with L.Ai = \u2212ni such that ni \u2265 1 for all i,\n\u2022 there is an j with nj \u2265 2 and\nP\n\u2022 the residual system M = L \u2212 ti=0 ni Ai has v(M) \u2265 0.\nThe main conjecture can be formulated as follows:\n2.4 Conjecture (Harbourne-Hirschowitz)\nA linear system L = L(d, m0 , m1 , . . . , mn ) is special if and only if it is (\u22121)-special.\nIt is easy to see that a (\u22121)-special system L is special because\nL.(L \u2212 KP\u2032 )\n(M + nA).(M + nA \u2212 KP\u2032 )\n=\n.\n2\n2\n= \u22121 by the rationality of \u00c3, this implies\nv(L) =\n\nSince A.KP\u2032\n\n\u2212n2 + n\n\u2212n2 + n\n\u2264 l(L) +\n.\n2\n2\nTherefore the opposite direction of the Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture is the non-trivial\none. It states that every special system L has fixed multiple (\u22121)-curves. Proving the\nconjecture leads to an answer of the dimensionality problem.\nv(L) = v(M) +\n\n2.5 Remark\nWe give a list of results on the conjecture. In fact we use all of them in several ways for\nthe proof of our main theorem.\nWe write L = L(d, mb00 , mb11 , . . . , mbrr ) if L has precisely bi base points of multiplicity mi\nfor i = 0, . . . , r.

The Classification\nIn the paper [CM98] of Ciliberto and Miranda a lot of classification work has been done\nwhich we can apply to our problem. Ciliberto and Miranda introduced two notions which\nwe recall now to use their results.\nLet L be a linear system of plane curves with general multiple base points as above. Then\nL is a quasi-homogeneous (-1)-class if L = L(d, m0 , mn ), on P\u2032 the self-intersection number\nL.L = \u22121 and the arithmetic genus\ngL =\n\nL2 + L.KP\u2032\n+ 1 = 0.\n2\n\nAs v(L) = L2 \u2212 gL + 1, these systems are never empty.\nIn this case, if A is a (\u22121)-curve such that A \u2208 L then by L.A = \u22121 and the irreducibility\nof A, we have L = {A}. So we can identify (\u22121)-curves and quasi-homogeneous (\u22121)classes and write A = L. Ciliberto and Miranda proved that such a (\u22121)-curve exists up\nto m \u2264 6. Hence a numerical classification of these systems gives a classification for all\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\n5\n\nquasi-homogeneous (\u22121)-curves up to multiplicity m = 6. Such a classification is given in\n[CM98].\nNow we consider the following phenomenon: Let L = L(d, m0 , mn ) be a quasihomogeneous linear system and A a (\u22121)-curve such that A = L(\u03b4, \u03bc0 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn ) and\nL.A \u2264 \u22122. Let Permn be the permutation group on n letters and let \u03c3 \u2208 Permn . We\ndefine A\u03c3 = L(\u03b4, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\u03c3(1) , . . . , \u03bc\u03c3(n) ). Then, as A is a (\u22121)-curve, it follows that A\u03c3 is\nagain a (\u22121)-curve. As L is quasi-homogeneous we have again L.A\u03c3 \u2264 \u22122. Therefore we\ncan construct a composition of (\u22121)-curves, which split off the system L. We define the\nset A \u2282 Permn to be maximal such that all A\u03c3 with \u03c3 \u2208 A are pairwise different. Then\nP\nwe define a new plane curve Atot = \u03c3\u2208A A\u03c3 (see [LU02]).\nWe call a linear system L\u2032 = L(d, mo , m1 , . . . , mn ) as above a quasi-homogeneous (-1)configuration if Atot is a generic element in L\u2032 . We note that L\u2032 is by construction quasihomogeneous (if k = |A| then there exists a \u03bc\u2032 such that L\u2032 = L(k\u03b4, k\u03bc0 , \u03bc\u2032n )).\n4.1 Lemma (splitting-off Lemma)\nLet L = L(d, m0 , mn ). Then every (\u22121)-curve A with L.A \u2264 \u22122 is of one of the following\ntypes (We have listed the associated quasi-homogeneous compound (\u22121)-configurations,\ntoo.):\nA = L(\u03b4, \u03bc0 , \u03bcn1 )\nA = L(\u03b4, \u03bc0 , \u03bc2 \u2212 1, \u03bc2n\u22121 ) Atot = L(n\u03b4, n\u03bc0 , (n\u03bc2 \u2212 1)n )\nA = L(\u03b4, \u03bc0 , \u03bc2 + 1, \u03bc2n\u22121 ) Atot = L(n\u03b4, n\u03bc0 , (n\u03bc2 + 1)n )\n\nProof:\nFirst one proves that strict transforms of different A\u03c3 6= A\u03c3\u2032 cannot meet positively on P\u2032 .\nThis is the case as otherwise one sees, by the Riemann-Roch theorem on P\u2032 , that the sum\nof these moves in a linear system of positive dimension, which is a contradiction to being a\nfixed part of L. This implies that all the different A\u03c3 are linearly independent in Pic(P\u2032 ).\nLet the \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn occur in sets of size k1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 ks . As rank Pic(P\u2032 ) = n + 2 we see by\nn!\ndifferent (\u22121)-curves A\u03c3 only the possibilities\ncombinatorial reasons that for the k1 !***k\ns!\ns = 1, k1 = n\nor\ns = 2, k1 = 1, k2 = n \u2212 1\ncan occur. That means we have at most three different multiplicities \u03bc0 , \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 .\nMoreover we have the equations A.A = \u22121 and A.A\u03c3 = 0 on P\u2032 . That gives A.A\u2212A.A\u03c3 =\n\u22121 which is equivalent to (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )2 = 1 (see [CM98]).\n\u0003\n\nFor the purpose of classifying the systems L(d, m0 , 6n ) we need a complete list of all (\u22121)curves which might split off such systems two times. These (\u22121)-curves can not have\nhigher multiplicities than 3 at the points p1 , . . . , pn . We obtain the following result:\n4.2 Lemma (classification of (\u22121)-curves)\nAll (\u22121)-curves A and quasi-homogeneous (\u22121)-configurations Atot up to multiplicity 3 in\nthe points p1 , . . . , pn which might split off a quasi-homogeneous system L = L(d, m0 , 6n )\nare elements of the systems in the following list (see [LU02]):\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nnot compound\nL(2, 0, 15 )\nL(e, e \u2212 1, 12e )\nL(1, 1, 11 )\nL(1, 0, 12 )\nL(6, 3, 27 )\nL(12, 8, 39 )\n\ncompound\ne\u22651\nL(n, n, 1n )\nL(3, 0, 23 )\n\nn\u22652\n\nIn particular, all the (\u22121)-curves are quasi-homogeneous.\nProof:\nWe refer to [CM98, Example 5.1] for the proof of a list of all quasi-homogeneous (\u22121)classes up to multiplicity 3. In [CM98, Example 5.15] is given a complete list of all quasihomogeneous (\u22121)-configurations up to multiplicity 3. Using this two lists and Lemma\n4.1 gives this result.\n\u0003\nNow we give the proof of the classification theorem of all (\u22121)-special systems of the form\nL(d, m0 , 6n ).\nProof of Theorem B:\nIn lemma 4.2 we have seen the possible cases for (\u22121)-curves which might split off\nL(d, m0 , 6n ). Now we have to consider all these cases. To be a little bit faster we proceed\nalong the following algorithm (see [LU02]):\nWe go through all possible combinations of these (\u22121)-curves step by step.\nFirst step: If we find a (\u22121)-curve or a (\u22121)-configuration A such that\nL.A = \u2212\u03bc \u2264 \u22122,\nthen we split off the fixed part and define M = L \u2212 \u03bc * A.\nSecond step: Let M\u2032 be the residual system of M obtained by splitting off all possible\n(\u22121)-curves. By the definition of (\u22121)-special systems we have to verify that v(M\u2032 ) \u2265 0.\nWe notice that the systems M are quasi-homogeneous of multiplicity \u2264 4 by lemma 4.2.\nTherefore we can use the results of [CM98] and [S99].\n\u2022 L = M + \u03bc * A, v(M) \u2265 0 and M.A = 0\n(1) A = L(2, 0, 15 ) and L = L(d, m0 , 65 )\nThis gives M = L(d \u2212 2n, m0 , (6 \u2212 \u03bc)5 ) and M.A = 0 gives d =\n\n30\u2212\u03bc\n2 .\n\nIf \u03bc = 2 =\u21d2 d = 14 and we get\nm0 = 0 and v(M) = 15 with M = L(10, 0, 45 ), non-special by [S99]\nm0 = 1 and v(M) = 14 with M = L(10, 1, 45 ), \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 2 and v(M) = 12 with M = L(10, 2, 45 ), \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 3 and v(M) = 9 with M = L(10, 3, 45 ), \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 4 and v(M) = 5 with M = L(10, 4, 45 ), \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 5 and v(M) = 0 with M = L(10, 5, 45 ), \u2032\u2032\n\u03bc = 3 is not possible because of M.A = 0.\nIf \u03bc = 4 =\u21d2 d = 13 and we conclude\nm0 = 0 and v(M) = 5 with M = L(7, 0, 25 ), non-special by [CM98]\nm0 = 1 and v(M) = 4 with M = L(7, 1, 25 ) , \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 2 and v(M) = 2 with M = L(7, 2, 25 ) , \u2032\u2032\nm0 = 3 and v(M) = \u22121\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\n7\n\n\u03bc = 5 is not possible because of M.A = 0.\nFrom \u03bc = 6 =\u21d2 d = 12 and m0 = 0, v(M) = 0 for M = L(0, 0).\n(2) A = L(e, e \u2212 1, 12e ) e \u2265 1 and L = L(d, m0 , 62e )\nThen follows M = L(d \u2212 \u03bc * e, m0 \u2212 \u03bc * e + \u03bc, (6 \u2212 \u03bc)2e ) and M.A = 0\ngives \u2212e * m0 + e * d \u2212 12e + m0 + \u03bc = 0 =\u21d2 m0 > d \u2212 12. v(M) \u2265 0 gives\nd \u2265 m0 + \u03bc \u2212 2.\n\u03bc = 2 =\u21d2 d \u2265 m0 > d \u2212 12\nm0 v(M) \u2264 \u22121 and M non-special\n\u2032\u2032\nd\n\u2032\u2032\nd\u22121\nm0\nfrom M.A = 0 \u21d2 d residual system\nd\u22122\n10e\nM = L(8e, 8e, 42e ) irregular by\n[S99] \u21d2 non-empty\nd\u22123\n9e + 1\nM = L(7e + 1, 7e, 42e ) irregular by\n[S99] \u21d2 non-empty\nd\u22124\n8e + 2\nM = L(6e + 2, 6e, 42e ) irregular by\n[S99] \u21d2 non-empty\nd\u22125\n7e + 3\nM = L(5e + 3, 5e, 42e ) regular by\n[S99] and v(M) = 9\nd\u22126\n6e + 4\nM = L(4e + 4, 4e, 42e ) regular by\n[S99] and v(M) = 14\nd\u22127\n5e + 5\nM = L(3e + 5, 3e, 42e ) regular by\n[S99] and v(M) = \u22122e + 20\nd\u22128\n4e + 6\nM = L(2e + 6, 2e, 42e ) regular by\n[S99] and v(M) = \u22126e + 27\nd\u22129\n3e + 7\nM = L(e+7, e, 42e ) regular by [S99]\nand v(M) = \u221212e + 35\nd \u2212 10\n2e + 8\nM = L(8, 0, 42e ) regular by [S99]\nand v(M) = \u221220e + 44\nd \u2212 11\ne+9\n\u21d2 m0 \u2264 \u22121 not possible\n\u03bc = 3 =\u21d2 d \u2212 1 \u2265 m0 > d \u2212 12\nm0 v(M) \u2264 \u22121 and M non-special\n\u2032\u2032\nd\u22121\n\u2032\u2032\nd\u22122\nm0 from M.A = 0 \u21d2 d residual system\nd\u22123\n9e\nM = L(6e, 6e, 32e ) irregular\n[CM98] and e(M) = 0\nd\u22124\n8e + 1\nM = L(5e + 1, 5e, 32e ) irregular\n[CM98] and e(M) = 2\nd\u22125\n7e + 2\nM = L(4e + 2, 4e, 32e ) regular\n[CM98] and v(M) = 5\nd\u22126\n6e + 3\nM = L(3e + 3, 3e, 32e ) regular\n[CM98] and v(M) = 9\n\nby\nby\nby\nby\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nfrom M.A = 0 \u21d2 d residual system\n5e + 4\nM = L(2e + 4, 2e, 32e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = \u22122e + 14\nd\u22128\n4e + 5\nM = L(e + 5, e, 32e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = \u22126e + 20\nd\u22129\n3e + 6\nM = L(6, 0, 32e ) regular by [CM98]\nand v(M) = \u221212e + 27\nd \u2212 10\n2e + 7\n\u21d2 m0 \u2264 \u22121 not possible\nm0\nd\u22127\n\n\u03bc = 4 =\u21d2 d \u2212 2 \u2265 m0 > d \u2212 12\nm0 from M.A = 0 \u21d2 d residual system\nd\u22122\n10e \u2212 2\nM = L(6e \u2212 2, 6e, 22e ) empty\nd\u22123\n9e \u2212 1\nM = L(5e \u2212 1, 5e, 22e ) empty\nd\u22124\n8e\nM = L(4e, 4e, 22e ) irregular by\n[CM98] and e(M) = 0\nd\u22125\n7e + 1\nM = L(3e + 1, 3e, 22e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = 2\nd\u22126\n6e + 2\nM = L(2e + 2, 2e, 22e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = 5\nd\u22127\n5e + 3\nM = L(e + 3, e, 22e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = \u22122e + 9\nd\u22128\n4e + 4\nM = L(4, 0, 22e ) regular by [CM98]\nand v(M) = \u22126e + 14\nd\u22129\n3e + 5\n\u21d2 m0 \u2264 \u22121 not possible\n\u03bc = 5 =\u21d2 d \u2212 3 \u2265 m0 > d \u2212 12\nm0 from M.A = 0 \u21d2 d residual system\nd\u22123\n9e \u2212 2\nM = L(4e \u2212 2, 4e, 12e ) empty\nd\u22124\n8e \u2212 1\nM = L(3e \u2212 1, 3e, 12e ) empty\nd\u22125\n7e\nM = L(2e, 2e, 12e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = 0\nd\u22126\n6e + 1\nM = L(e + 1, e, 12e ) regular by\n[CM98] and v(M) = 2\nd\u22127\n5e + 2\nM = L(2, 0, 12e ) regular by [CM98]\nand v(M) = \u22122e + 5\nd\u22128\n4e + 3\n\u21d2 m0 \u2264 \u22121 not possible\nFor \u03bc = 6 we have that d \u2212 4 \u2265 m0 > d \u2212 12.

From\nM.A1 = 0 and M.A2 = 0 we get m0 = d \u2212 3 and d = 9e + 1.

The Degeneration Method\nIn this section we give a rough overview of the degeneration of the plane as introduced by\nCiliberto and Miranda in [CM98]. We refer to this paper for further details. As in every\ndegeneration method the aim is to specialize the base points of a system L(d, m0 , mn ) in\nsuch a way that on the one hand the dimension is easier to compute but on the other hand\nit does not change.\nAt first we consider the geometric situation. Let \u2206 be a complex disc around the origin.\nWe define V = P2 \u00d7 \u2206. Let p1 : V \u2212\u2192 P2 and p2 : V \u2212\u2192 \u2206 be the projections. Now we\nblow up a line L in V0 = p\u22121\n2 (0) (f : X \u2212\u2192 V ) and obtain the following situation with\n\u03c0i = f \u25e6 p i :\nX0 = P \u222aR F\nX:\n::\n\u000e\u000e \u000e\n:\n\u000e f :::\n:: \u03c02\n\u000e\u000e \u000e \u000f\n\u03c01 \u000e\n:\nV\nL\nLL :::\n\u000e\u000e \u000e ~~\nL\nLL ::\n\u000e ~~\nLL :\np2 LLL::\n\u000e\u0007\u000e ~~\u000e ~~~ p1\nL% \u001c\n\nP2\n\nF?\n?\n\n?? \u03c3\n??\n??\n\u001f\n\nP2\n\n\u2206\n\n\u223c P2 for all t 6= 0. X0 = \u03c0 \u22121 (0) is a union of two surfaces, the strict\nNow Xt = \u03c02\u22121 (t) =\n2\ntransform of V0 \u223c\n= P2 (called P) and the exceptional divisor F = f \u22121 (L). F is isomorphic\nto the blow-up of P2 in one point p (here via \u03c3). The surfaces are glued together along the\nline R, which can be identified with L in P and with the exceptional divisor E = \u03c3 \u22121 (p)\nin F.\nAs in [CM98] we define OX (d) = \u03c01\u2217 OP2 (d) and OX (d, k) = OX (d) \u2297OX OX (kP). We set\n\u03c7(d, k) = OX (d, k)|X0 . Let H be the pull-back of a general line in P2 via \u03c3. Then we\nhave OX (d, k)|Xt \u223c\n= OP2 (d) for t 6= 0. Furthermore \u03c7(d, k)|P \u223c\n= OP2 (d \u2212 k) and \u03c7(d, k)|F \u223c\n=\nOF (dH \u2212 (d \u2212 k)E).\nWe fix n \u2212 b + 1 general points p0 , p1 , . . . , pn\u2212b on P and b general points pn\u2212b+1 , . . . , pn\non F. We define L0 to be the linear sub-system of \u03c7(d, k) defined by all divisors of\n\u03c7(d, k) having multiplicity at least m0 at p0 and at least m at the points p1 , . . . , pn (write\nL0 = L(d, m0 , mn\u2212b , mb )). We say that L0 is obtained from L = L(d, m0 , mn ) by an\n(k,b)-degeneration. L0 can be considered as a flat limit on X0 of L. By semi-continuity\nwe obtain\nl0 = l(L0 ) \u2265 l(L).\nIn particular, if l0 = e(L) then L is non-special.\nNow L0 restricts on P to a system LP = L(d \u2212 k, m0 , mn\u2212b ). Furthermore we restrict L0\non F to LF = L(d, d \u2212 k, mb ) (the identification we obtain by blowing down LF to P2 via\n\u03c3). Now we define as in [CM98] RP to be the linear system on R obtained by restricting\nLP to R. We have the following exact sequence\n+L\n\n|L\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 L\u0302P \u2212\u2192 LP \u2212\u2192 RP \u2212\u2192 0.\nThe kernel system L\u0302P consists of all divisors having L as component. So we can identify\nL\u0302P = L(d \u2212 k \u2212 1, m0 , mn\u2212b ).\nWe analogously define RF and obtain L\u0302F = L(d, d \u2212 k + 1, mb ) (parametrising the divisors\nin LF which have E as a component).\nLet us recall some further abbreviations from [CM98]:\n5.1 Definitions\n\n\f12\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nvP = v(LP ), vF = v(LF ),\nv\u0302P = v(L\u0302P ), v\u0302F = v(L\u0302F ),\nlP = l(LP ), lF = l(LF ),\nl\u0302P = l(L\u0302P ), l\u0302F = l(L\u0302F ),\nrP = lP \u2212 l\u0302P \u2212 1, the dimension of RP ,\nrF = lF \u2212 l\u0302F \u2212 1, the dimension of RF .\nIn [CM98] it is shown that the associated vector spaces to RP and RF are transversal\nsubspaces of \u0393(R, OR (d \u2212 k)). This leads to the following corollary:\n5.2 Corollary (Key-Lemma on l0 )\nWe have two cases:\n(1) If rP + rF \u2264 d \u2212 k \u2212 1, then l0 = l\u0302P + l\u0302F + 1.\n(2) If rP + rF \u2265 d \u2212 k \u2212 1, then l0 = lP + lF \u2212 d + k.\nA proof can be found in [CM98]\n6. Proof of the Main Theorem\nBefore giving the proof let us state two lemmas which are corollaries of the Key-Lemma\n5.2. The proof of these is given for an analogous case in [LU02].\n6.1 Lemma (case v(L) \u2264 \u22121)\nLet L = L(d, m0 , 6n ) with v(L) \u2264 \u22121. If there are integers k (k < d) and b (b < n) such\nthat a (k, b)-degeneration can be found with the following properties of the restrictions of\nL0\n\u2022 LF and LP are both non-special, and\n\u2022 the kernel systems L\u0302F and L\u0302P are empty with v\u0302P \u2264 v(L),\nthen L is empty.\n6.2 Lemma (case v(L) \u2265 \u22121)\nLet L = L(d, m0 , 6n ) with v(L) \u2265 \u22121. If there are integers k (k < d) and b (b < n) such\nthat a (k, b)-degeneration can be found with\n\u2022 LF and LP are both non-special, vP \u2265 \u22121, vF \u2265 \u22121, and\n\u2022 the kernel systems L\u0302F and L\u0302P have the property v(L) \u2212 1 \u2265 l\u0302P + l\u0302F ,\nthen L is non-special.\nThe following three lemmas state parts of the result of the Main Theorem A. We prove\nthem independently later on.\n6.3 Lemma (three base points)\nA linear system L(d, m0 , mn ) with at most three base points (n \u2264 2) is special if and only\nif it is (\u22121)-special.\n6.4 Lemma (large multiplicities m0 in p0 )\nLet d \u2265 25. If m0 \u2265 d \u2212 9 then L(d, m0 , 6n ) is special if and only if it is (\u22121)-special.\n6.5 Lemma (low degrees)\nIf d \u2264 140 then L(d, m0 , 6n ) is special if and only if it is (\u22121)-special.\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\n13\n\nProof of the Main Theorem A:\nLet L = L(d, m0 , 6n ). By the lemma for large multiplicities (6.4) we can assume that\nd \u2265 m0 + 10 \u2265 10.\nFurthermore by the lemma for low degrees (6.5) the statement is true for d \u2264 140. We\ncan assume d \u2265 141. We continue by induction on d where 6.5 can be considered as the\nbase of the induction.\nAs all such L are not (\u22121)-special we have to show that L is non-special. The method is\nto get the system L0 on the special fiber by a degeneration of L. With Lemmas 6.1 and\n6.2 we can prove the regularity of L if the restrictions of L0 to P and to F have certain\nproperties. These properties can be achieved as the main conjecture holds for the systems\non P by induction and for the ones on F by 6.4.\nWe perform now a (5, b)-degeneration on L and get the following systems on the special\nfiber:\nP: LP = L(d \u2212 5, m0 , 6n\u2212b ) F: LF = L(d, d \u2212 5, 6b )\nL\u0302P = L(d \u2212 6, m0 , 6n\u2212b )\n\nL\u0302F = L(d, d \u2212 4, 6b )\n\nStep 1 (case v(L) \u2264 \u22121):\nWe want to apply Lemma 6.1 for the case v(L) \u2264 \u22121.\nFirst of all we need to have L\u0302F empty. By the lemma for large multiplicities in m0 (6.4)\nwe have that L\u0302F is non-special if it is non-(\u22121)-special. Therefore by our classification\ntheorem B it is sufficient to choose d < 4b, i.e., b > d4 . Also we get v\u0302F \u2264 \u22121, which means\nthis system is empty.\nNext let us find a sufficient condition to get v\u0302P \u2264 v(L). A computation gives v\u0302P \u2212 v(L) =\n\u22126d + 21b + 9, hence it is sufficient to have \u22126d + 21b + 9 \u2264 0, that is b \u2264 6d\u22129\n21 .\nNow we want to find sufficient conditions to have LF non-special. By 6.4 this is already\nthe case if we find conditions for LF not to be (\u22121)-special. By Theorem B it is sufficient\n2\n2\n6d\u22129\nto force d > 7b\n2 + 3, that is b < 7 (d \u2212 3). As 7 (d \u2212 3) \u2264 21 , this new condition on b\nincludes also v\u0302P \u2264 v(L).\nIn the next step we are searching for a sufficient condition to get LP non-special. By\ninduction on d LP = L(d \u2212 5, m0 , 6n\u2212b ) is special if and only if it is (\u22121)-special. By our\nlist in Theorem B we notice that LP is non-(\u22121)-special if we choose n \u2212 b odd as we have\nassumed that d \u2212 m0 \u2265 10 and d \u2265 141.\nIn the last step we look for a sufficient condition on b to get L\u0302P empty. Here we have to\nbe more careful. When d \u2212 m0 \u2265 11 we get for the same reasons as in the case of LP that\nL\u0302P is non-special if n \u2212 b is odd. When d \u2212 m0 = 10 then from Theorem B we know that\nl\u0302P = \u221220(n \u2212 b) + 5(d \u2212 6) \u2212 6 if n \u2212 b is odd. That means we want this expression to\nbe negative. From l\u0302P \u2264 \u22121 \u21d0\u21d2 b \u2264 41 (7 \u2212 d) + n we get a sufficient condition on b. As\nby assumption v(L) \u2264 \u22121, we can conclude that v(L) = 11d \u2212 21n \u2212 45 \u2264 \u22121. Therefore\nn \u2265 11d\u221244\n21 . That means we can formulate the above condition on b without n (using a\n29\nlower bound on n) and get b \u2264 41 (7 \u2212 d) + 11d\u221244\n= \u2212 84\n+ 23d\n21\n84 .\nLet us now reformulate all sufficient conditions (separated for the cases d \u2212 m0 = 10 and\nd \u2212 m0 > 10) in a compact form: If d \u2212 m0 > 10 we find a b such that we can apply\nLemma 6.1 if\n6 1\n2\nd \u2212 \u2212 d > 2 \u21d0\u21d2 d \u2265 81.\n7\n7 4\n\n\f14\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nIf d \u2212 m0 = 10 we find also a b to apply 6.1 if\n\u2212\n\n29 23\n1\n+ d \u2212 d > 2 \u21d0\u21d2 d \u2265 99.\n84 84\n4\n\nStep 2 (case v(L) \u2265 \u22121):\nWe want to use Lemma 6.2 for the case v(L) \u2265 \u22121. Still all notations are with respect to\nthe above (5, b)-degeneration.\nIn a first step we want to find a sufficient condition on b to get LP non-special. Exactly\nas in step 1 we get by induction that LP is non-special if we choose b such that n \u2212 b is\nodd, because we assume d \u2212 m0 \u2265 10 and d \u2265 141.\nNext we want to find sufficient conditions on b to get the system LF non-special and\nvF \u2265 \u22121. By the lemma for large multiplicities (6.4) in m0 we have again as above that\nLF is non-special if and only if it is non-(\u22121)-special. We conclude that we get LF nonspecial if we have d > 72 b + 3, that is if b < 27 d \u2212 76 , by Theorem B. As vF = 6d \u2212 21b \u2212 10\nwe see that vF \u2265 \u22121 which is equivalent to b \u2264 72 d \u2212 37 . Therefore the condition for getting\nLF non-special gives already that vF \u2265 \u22121.\nFrom Theorem B we note again that b >\n\nd\n4\n\nconfirms that L\u0302F is non-special and v\u0302F \u2264 \u22121.\n\nLet us now consider L\u0302P : As above L\u0302P is by induction non-special if n \u2212 b is odd and\nd \u2212 m0 \u2265 11. In the case d \u2212 m0 \u2265 11 we force also v\u0302P \u2264 v(L), that is b \u2264 6d\u22129\n21 . In the\ncase d \u2212 m0 = 10 we conclude - exactly as above - that if n \u2212 b is odd L\u0302P is non-special\nor l\u0302P = \u221220(n \u2212 b) + 5(d \u2212 6) \u2212 6. Therefore we force \u221220(n \u2212 b) + 5(d \u2212 6) \u2212 6 \u2264 \u22121,\nthat means b \u2264 14 (7 \u2212 d) + n. As we are in the case v(L) \u2265 \u22121 we have the equation\n11d \u2212 21n \u2212 45 \u2265 \u22121 which means n \u2264 11d\u221244\n21 . It is enough to check the independence of\nall conditions on the base points in L for the highest possible number n of points. We fix\n\u2212 1 of it. That means a sufficient condition for L\u0302P to\nthis n and use a lower bound 11d\u221244\n21\n1\n11d\u221244\nbe non-special is b \u2264 4 (7 \u2212 d) + 21 \u2212 1 = \u2212113+23d\n.\n84\nTo fulfill all these conditions we need to have d large enough. All together this gives so\nfar:\nIf d \u2212 m0 \u2265 11 we are able to find a sufficient b if\n2\n6 1\nd \u2212 \u2212 d > 2 \u21d0\u21d2 d \u2265 81.\n7\n7 4\nIf d \u2212 m0 = 10 we are able to find a sufficient b if\n113 1\n23\nd\u2212\n\u2212 d > 2 \u21d0\u21d2 d \u2265 141.\n84\n84\n4\nIn both cases we have that LP and LF are non-special and vF \u2265 \u22121. From v\u0302F \u2264 \u22121 and\nfrom vP = v \u2212 1 \u2212 v\u0302F we get immediately vP \u2265 \u22121. We have v \u2265 v\u0302P . As L\u0302F and L\u0302P are\nnon-special we are able to conclude the following two cases:\nIf v\u0302P \u2264 \u22121 then\nl\u0302P + l\u0302F = \u22122 \u2264 v \u2212 1,\nand if v\u0302P \u2265 \u22121 then\nl\u0302P + l\u0302F = v\u0302P + l\u0302F \u2264 v \u2212 1.\nIn both cases we are able to apply Lemma 6.2 and conclude that L is non-special.\n\u0003\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\n15\n\n7. Proof of the Lemmas\nBefore starting the proofs we should take some time to explain the use of Quadratic\nCremona Transformations for our purpose. We identify such a transformation with blowing\nup three general points and blowing down their connecting lines. Such a transformation\nis called to be based on the three points. Furthermore one can see by the blow-up and\n-down interpretation that a linear system L(d, m0 , m1 , m2 , m3 , . . . , mn ) is transformed by\na Cremona transformation based on the points p0 , p1 , p2 to a system L(2d \u2212 m0 \u2212 m1 \u2212\nm2 , d \u2212 m1 \u2212 m2 , d \u2212 m0 \u2212 m2 , d \u2212 m0 \u2212 m1 , m3 , . . . , mn ). If all involved numbers are\nnon-negative (see [CM98]), the dimension and the virtual dimension of a system L do not\nchange under Cremona transformations. In fact a (\u22121)-curve splitting off a system L is\ntransformed again into a (\u22121)-curve, which splits off the transformed system. Therefore it\nis equivalent to examine a system L or its Cremona transformed for our purpose. We use\nsuitable sequences of Cremona transformations in the following proofs to obtain systems\nwhich are already examined in previous papers.\nProof of the lemma of three base points 6.3:\nThis can be seen by direct computations with base points (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0) and\n(0 : 0 : 1). Of course, the statement is also included in the result in [H89].\n\u0003\nProof of the lemma of large multiplicities m0 in p0 6.4:\nWe consider the system L(d, m0 , 6n ). For the case of m0 \u2265 d \u2212 7 [CM98, Proposition\n6.2., Corollary 6.3., Proposition 6.4.] give a classification of the special systems of this\ntype. Comparing it with our list in Theorem B gives the statement. Now let d \u2265 25. The\nstrategy for the proof is to perform a sequence of Cremona transformations in order to get\nsystems, which can be examined easier. Furthermore we apply the degeneration method\nagain and use again Cremona transformations to prove regularity of some of the obtained\nsystems.\ncase: d \u2212 m0 = 8\nLet L = L(d, d \u2212 8, 6n ). We note that if we perform k Cremona transformations, based\non p0 and successively on two other base points of multiplicity 6, we obtain that it is now\nequivalent to consider the Cremona transformed system (for the strategy see [LU02]):\nL \u223c L(d \u2212 4k, d \u2212 8 \u2212 4k, 6n\u22122k , 22k )\nWe set d \u2212 8 = 4t + \u01eb with \u01eb \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. And n = 2q + \u03b7 with \u03b7 \u2208 {0, 1}.\nIf t \u2264 q we perform k = t transformations on L(d, d \u2212 8, 6n ) based on p0 and successively\ntwo other base points of multiplicity 6 and obtain\nL \u223c L(8 + \u01eb, \u01eb, 6n\u22122t , 22t ).\nThe system on the right hand side is of bounded multiplicity, that means all multiplicities\nare \u2264 6. Such systems are special if and only if they are (\u22121)-special by [Y03].\nIf t > q we perform k = q transformations on L(d, d \u2212 8, 6n ) again based on p0 and\nsuccessively two other base points of multiplicity 6 and obtain\nL \u223c L(d \u2212 4q, d \u2212 8 \u2212 4q, 6\u03b7 , 22q ).\nIf \u03b7 = 0 we are in the case of quasi-homogeneous linear systems of multiplicity 2, here the\nmain conjecture is true by [CM98].\nIf \u03b7 = 1 we have to examine systems of the type L = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 8, 6, 22q ) with \u03b4 = d \u2212 4q.\nNow let us perform a (2, b)-degeneration and get the following systems:\nLP = L(\u03b4 \u2212 2, \u03b4 \u2212 8, 6, 22q\u2212b ) LF = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 2, 2b )\n\n\f16\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nL\u0302P = L(\u03b4 \u2212 3, \u03b4 \u2212 8, 6, 22q\u2212b ) L\u0302F = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 1, 2b )\nIf v(L) \u2264 \u22121 we want to apply lemma 6.1.\nBy our classification Theorem B there is no (\u22121)-special system of the type L(d, d \u2212 8, 6n )\nif d \u2265 25. That means we have to show that the system L is empty. To use 6.1 we have\nagain to consider all the systems obtained by the degeneration as in the proof of the main\ntheorem.\nIn a first step let us consider L\u0302F . As L\u0302F is a quasi-homogeneous system of multiplicity\nm = 2 we see in [CM98], that this system is never special. Then v\u0302F = 2\u03b4 \u2212 3b leads to a\nsufficient condition to get L\u0302F empty. This condition is b \u2265 2\u03b4+1\n3 .\nIn a next step we want to find a sufficient condition to get LF non-special. This is true by\n[CM98] if b is odd. So let us force b to be odd as a sufficient condition for this case.\nNow we consider LP . We claim: LP is non-special.\nTo show the claim we apply at first a Cremona transformation based on the points of\nmultiplicity \u03b4 \u2212 8, 6 and on one point of multiplicity 2. This leads to the following system:\nLP \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 4, \u03b4 \u2212 10, 4, 22q\u2212b\u22121 ).\nAbove we forced b to be odd, therefore we assume 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 \u2265 2 (otherwise skip this step)\nis even. Now we apply successively 2q\u2212b\u22121\nCremona transformations, based in p0 and two\n2\npoints of multiplicity 2. Therefore we see that we have the following equivalence:\nLP \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 4 + 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1, \u03b4 \u2212 10 + 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1, 42q\u2212b ).\nFrom \u03b4 = d \u2212 4q \u2265 12 + \u01eb we get by [S99, Theorem 2.1, Theorem 5.2] that this system is\nnever special.\nFinally we have to consider L\u0302P . Again we claim that L\u0302P is never special.\nWe have by the above assumption that 2q \u2212 b is odd. At first we split off the line through\nthe points of multiplicity \u03b4 \u2212 8 and 6. As the virtual dimension doesn't change we get\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 4, \u03b4 \u2212 9, 5, 22q\u2212b ).\nAnother Cremona transformation based in p0 , p1 and one point of multiplicity 2 leads to\nthe equivalence\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 6, \u03b4 \u2212 11, 3, 22q\u2212b\u22121 ).\nCremona transformations based in p0\nNow as in the case of LP we apply another 2q\u2212b\u22121\n2\nand successively in two points of multiplicity 2. We end up with the equivalence:\n2q \u2212 b \u2212 1\n2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 2q\u2212b\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 6 +\n, \u03b4 \u2212 11 +\n,3\n).\n2\n2\nNow we are able to conclude with [CM98] - as we are in the case of a quasi-homogeneous\nsystem of multiplicity 3 - that this system is never special.\nTo apply 6.1 we have to find a sufficient condition for b to get v\u0302P \u2264 \u22121, therefore it is\nsufficient to have v\u0302P \u2212 v(L) \u2264 0, which is equivalent to b \u2264 \u03b4.\n\u2265 2 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b4 \u2265 8. As we have seen above\nAll together we find a sufficient b if \u03b4 \u2212 2\u03b4+1\n3\nwe have already \u03b4 \u2265 12 + \u01eb. This means we can apply Lemma 6.1 and conclude that\nL(d, d \u2212 8, 6n ) is empty in the case v(L) \u2264 \u22121.\nNow we have to consider the case v(L) \u2265 \u22121. Here we want to apply the Lemma 6.2.\nAs in the case v(L) \u2264 \u22121 we can always find a b such that all the systems obtained by\nthe above (2, b)-degeneration are non-special. Let us choose such a b like above and then\nconsider the systems LP , L\u0302P , LF and L\u0302F . From vP = v(L)\u2212 v\u0302F \u22121, v\u0302F \u2264 \u22121 and v(L) \u2265 \u22121\nwe conclude vP \u2265 v(L) \u2265 \u22121. A direct computation gives vF \u2265 \u22121.\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\n17\n\nAs the inequality v\u0302P \u2264 v(L) is also fulfilled we get l\u0302P \u2264 v(L). Therefore we can apply\nLemma 6.2 and conclude that L(d, d \u2212 8, 6n ) is non-special.\ncase: d \u2212 m0 = 9\nLet L = L(d, d \u2212 9, 6n ). We note as above that if we perform k Cremona transformations,\nbased on p0 and successively on two other base points of multiplicity 6, we obtain that:\nL \u223c L(d \u2212 3k, d \u2212 9 \u2212 3k, 6n\u22122k , 32k )\nWe set d \u2212 9 = 3t + \u01eb with \u01eb \u2208 {0, 1, 2}. And n = 2q + \u03b7 with \u03b7 \u2208 {0, 1}.\nIf t \u2264 q we perform k = t transformations on L(d, d \u2212 9, 6n ) based on m0 and successively\non two other base points of multiplicity 6 and obtain\nL \u223c L(9 + \u01eb, \u01eb, 6n\u22122t , 32t ).\nThen the system on the right hand side is of bounded multiplicity, that means all multiplicities are \u2264 6. As mentioned above such systems are special if and only if they are\n(\u22121)-special by [Y03].\nIf t > q we perform k = q transformations on L(d, d \u2212 9, 6n ) and obtain\nL \u223c L(d \u2212 3q, d \u2212 9 \u2212 3q, 6\u03b7 , 32q ).\nIf \u03b7 = 0 we are in the case of quasi-homogeneous linear systems of multiplicity 3, here the\nmain conjecture is true by [CM98].\nIf \u03b7 = 1 we have to examine systems of the type L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u22129, 6, 32q ) with \u03b4 = d\u22123q. If \u03b4 < 15\nwe are in the case of systems of bounded multiplicity where the main conjecture holds by\n[Y03]. So we can assume \u03b4 \u2265 15. Also we can assume q \u2265 1 (otherwise the statement is\nclear). Now let us perform a (3, b)-degeneration and get the following systems:\nLP = L(\u03b4 \u2212 3, \u03b4 \u2212 9, 6, 32q\u2212b ) LF = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 3, 3b )\nL\u0302P = L(\u03b4 \u2212 4, \u03b4 \u2212 9, 6, 32q\u2212b ) L\u0302F = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 2, 3b )\nIf v(L) \u2264 \u22121 we again want to apply Lemma 6.1.\nSo let as go through all the systems from the above (3, b)-degeneration and search for\nsufficient conditions on b to apply Lemma 6.1.\nLet us consider L\u0302F at first. Here it is sufficient to choose b >\nspecial by [CM98] and l\u0302F = \u22121.\n\n\u03b4\n2\n\nto get this system non-\n\nIn a next step consider LF . By [CM98] this is non-special if b is odd.\nThen we force (to apply 6.1) v\u0302P \u2264 v. This is fulfilled if b \u2264\n\n2\u03b4\u22121\n3 .\n\nNow let us consider LP . We claim that this system is never special. To see that let us\nperform Cremona transformation based on the points of multiplicity \u03b4 \u2212 9, 6 and 3. We\nobtain:\nLP \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 6, \u03b4 \u2212 12, 32q\u2212b\u22121 )\nThese systems are always regular by [CM98] as we have \u03b4 high enough.\nA little bit more complicated is the case of L\u0302P . We are searching for a sufficient condition\non b to get L\u0302P empty. We want to show, that L\u0302P is never special. Then we get the\ncondition simply be choosing b such that v\u0302P \u2264 \u22121 (fulfilled by v\u0302P \u2264 v).\nFirst of all we split off a line through p0 , the point of multiplicity m0 = \u03b4 \u2212 9, and the\npoint of multiplicity 6. Therefore we obtain\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 5, \u03b4 \u2212 10, 5, 32q\u2212b ).\n\n\f18\n\nMICHAEL KUNTE\n\nas the virtual dimension doesn't change in that case. If 2q \u2212 b > 0 applying a further\nCremona transformation based in the points of multiplicity \u03b4 \u2212 10, 5 and one point of\nmultiplicity 3 gives\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 8, \u03b4 \u2212 13, 2, 32q\u2212b\u22121 ).\nNote that 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 is an even number, as b is odd. We apply now successively Cremona\ntransformations, based on the point p0 and on two other points of multiplicity 3. It is\nbetter again to consider two different cases.\nAt first assume \u03b4 \u2212 13 \u2265\n\n2q\u2212b\u22121\n.\n2\n\nThen we get\n\n2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 2q\u2212b\n2q \u2212 b \u2212 1\n, \u03b4 \u2212 13 \u2212\n,2\n).\n2\n2\nBy [CM98] such a system is never special.\nL\u0302P \u223c L(\u03b4 \u2212 8 \u2212\n\nSecondly assume \u03b4 \u2212 13 <\nwe obtain:\n\n2q\u2212b\u22121\n.\n2\n\nLet m = \u03b4 \u2212 13. Then after m such transformations\n\nL\u0302P \u223c L(5, 22m+1 , 32q\u2212b\u22121\u22122m ).\nAgain splitting off a line through two points of multiplicity 3 (virtual dimension does not\nchange) gives:\nL\u0302P \u223c L(4, 22(m+1)+1 , 32q\u2212b\u22121\u22122(m+1) ).\nNow two if 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 \u2212 2(m + 1) \u2265 2 splitting off lines gives that LP is empty. Secondly\nif 2q \u2212 b \u2212 1 \u2212 2(m + 1) = 0 we have also by [CM98] that the system is empty (as m \u2265 2\nby assumption that \u03b4 \u2265 15).\nTaking into account all our conditions on b we require\n2\u03b4 \u2212 1 \u03b4\n\u2212 > 2 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b4 \u2265 15.\n3\n2\nFinally applying Lemma 6.1 gives that the system L = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 9, 6, 32q ) is empty in the\ncase v \u2264 \u22121.\nNow we have to consider the case v(L) \u2265 \u22121. We want to apply Lemma 6.2.\nAs in the case of v \u2264 \u22121 we get that all the systems LF , L\u0302F , LP and L\u0302P are non-special\nand l\u0302F = \u22121 and v\u0302P \u2264 v with a suitable b for the degeneration.\nThat means here l\u0302P \u2264 v and we can apply Lemma 6.2 and conclude that v(L) = l, that\nmeans L = L(\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 9, 6, 32q ) is regular.\nThis finally completes our proof for the case of multiplicities m0 = d \u2212 8 and m0 = d \u2212 9.\n\u0003\nProof of the lemma of low degrees 6.5:\nThe main tool for this proof is a computer program which uses (5, b)- and (6, b)degenerations of the plane in order to prove that certain non-(\u22121)-special systems are\nnon-special. This algorithm is given by Laface and Ugaglia in [LU02]. We implemented this\nalgorithm in Singular (see [Sing]). Furthermore to treat the cases where the degenerationmethod fails we implemented a method used by Yang in [Y03]. This method specializes\nthe base points on a line and moves them to infinity. Then it is easier to check if the given\nconditions on the base points are independent. If this is still the case it proves regularity\nof a given system.\nBelow we list only the cases in which the program fails. All these but 10 cases are solved\nby ad-hoc methods (mainly Cremona transformations). The remaining 10 cases we computed directly with Singular in characteristic 32003. One can see that this implies then\nregularity in characteristic 0, too.\n\n\fQUASI-HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS ON P WITH BASE POINTS OF MULTIPLICITY 6\n\nd \u2212
