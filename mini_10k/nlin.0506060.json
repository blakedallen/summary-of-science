The dynamical instability is described as a rapid expansion of the\ndifference between two nearby trajectories, namely the\nLyapunov vector, and the system is called chaotic if at\nleast one exponential rate (Lyapunov exponent) of divergence or contraction of the amplitude of Lyapunov vector\nis positive. The Lyapunov exponent \u03bb is defined for each\nindependent direction of the phase space, so the chaotic\nproperties of many-body systems can be characterized by\nan ordered set of Lyapunov exponents, the so-called Lyapunov spectrum {\u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) , * * * } where \u03bb(1) \u2265 \u03bb(2) \u2265 * * * .\nThe Lyapunov spectrum is connected to the contraction\nrate of the phase space volume (roughly speaking, the\ndissipation rate) through the sum of all the Lyapunov exponents, allowing the calculation of transport coefficients\nfrom the Lyapunov spectra [1, 2, 3]. The conjugate pairing rule for Lyapunov spectra reduces the calculation of\nthe sum of all the Lyapunov exponents to the sum of just\none pair of Lyapunov exponents [4, 5, 6, 7]. The set of\nall positive Lyapunov exponents specifies the natural invariant measure [8, 9], which is used to calculate various\nquantities using periodic orbit theory [10] and led to the\nfirst form of the fluctuation theorem [11, 12, 13]. On the\nother hand, recently, much attention has been paid to\nindividual Lyapunov exponents and their Lyapunov vectors for many-body systems. As each Lyapunov exponent\nhas the dimensions of inverse time, the Lyapunov spectrum can be regarded as a time-scale spectrum. From\nthis point of view, Lyapunov exponents with small absolute values are connected to large and macroscopic timescale behavior of many-body systems, and in this region\nthe wave-like structure of Lyapunov vectors, known as\nthe Lyapunov modes, is observed [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nThe Lyapunov mode is a reflection of a collective movement (phonon mode) of many-body systems, and comes\nfrom dynamical conservation laws and translational invariance [18, 19, 20, 21]. On the other hand, large Lyapunov exponents are dominated by small and microscopic\ntime-scale movement, and in this region the spatially lo-\n\ncalized behavior of Lyapunov vector, the so-called Lyapunov localization, appears [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].\nFor the largest Lyapunov exponent of many-body chaotic\nsystems, analytical calculations have been attempted\n[29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. The time-scale separation in manybody systems is crucial to extract a macroscopic dynamics from microscopic many-body dynamics, and the Lyapunov spectrum allows us to discuss it dynamically.\nAs one of the features of Lyapunov vectors for manybody systems, the Lyapunov localization appears as a\nbehavior in which the Lyapunov vector components for a\nfew particles are significantly larger than the other components. Moreover, the localized region of a Lyapunov\nvector moves as a function of time. The magnitude of\nthe localization of each Lyapunov vector can be measured quantitatively by the Lyapunov localization spectrum, which is defined as a set of exponential functions\nof entropy-like quantities for the normalized amplitudes\nof the Lyapunov vector components [28, 34, 35]. We have\npreviously reported that the Lyapunov localization spectra show a bending behavior at low density, and its connection with kinetic theory properties (e.g. the Krylov\nrelation for the largest Lyapunov exponent, and the mean\nfree time being inversely-proportional to density, etc.)\nis discussed for many-hard-disk systems [28, 34]. However, the Lyapunov localization spectrum requires taking\na time-average and characterizes only the static localization of the Lyapunov vectors. The physical meaning of\nthe movement of the localized regions of Lyapunov vectors is not clearly understood.\nThe principal aim of this paper is to discuss dynamically the movement of the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors in many-hard-disk systems at low density.\nTo discuss this problem we use the fact shown in Ref.\n[28] that at low density only two particle components of\nthe normalized Lyapunov vector for large Lyapunov exponents have a non-zero value. This is due to the shortrange of particle interactions in a many-hard-disk system.\nThe movement of the localized region of the Lyapunov\nvector appears to be a series of jumps or hops, so we can\nintroduce a hopping rate to describe the dynamics. To\nsimplify the problem, in this paper we consider quasione-dimensional systems, in which the system width is\nso narrow that disks always remain in the same order\n\n\f2\n\n[18, 21, 28, 34]. We show that this hopping rate depends\non the hopping distance, and is a decreasing function of\nthe hopping distance. This implies that there is a spatial\ncorrelation among localized regions of Lyapunov vectors.\nWe explain the hopping-distance dependence of the\nhopping rate in many-hard-disk systems in two ways. In\nthe first approach we use a simple model expressed as an\naccumulation of bricks. Here, the hopping of the localized\nregion of the Lyapunov vectors is expressed as a change\nin the position of the highest brick site. This model is\na one-dimensional version of the so-called clock model,\nwhich has been used to calculate Lyapunov exponents\nfor many-hard-disk systems [31, 32, 33]. In this paper we\ndemonstrate that this model can reproduce the largest\nLyapunov exponent for quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk\nsystems. As the second approach to the hopping behavior\nof the localized Lyapunov vectors, we propose an analytical method to calculate the hopping rate from the sum\nof probability distributions for the brick height configurations between two separated highest brick sites. Using\nthis analytical approach we can also discuss the relation\nbetween the hopping rate and the Lyapunov exponent.\nHopping rates calculated by these two approaches are in\ngood agreement with the ones for quasi-one-dimensional\nhard-disk systems.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II\nwe introduce the quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk system, and show the localized behavior of the Lyapunov\nvector corresponding to the largest Lyapunov exponent\nat low density. In Sec. III we introduce the hopping\nrate of the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors, and\nshow the hopping-distance dependence for many-harddisk systems. In Sec. IV we discuss the hopping rate\nusing a brick accumulation model. In Sec. V we propose\nan analytical expression for the hopping rate. Section\nVI is our conclusion and some remarks. In Appendix\nA we discuss the technical details of the calculation of\nthe hopping rate. In Appendix B we give a microscopic\nderivation of the brick accumulation model.\nII. QUASI-ONE-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEM AND\nLOCALIZATION OF LYAPUNOV VECTORS\n\nThe system which we consider in this paper is a quasione-dimensional system consisting of N hard-disks in periodic boundary conditions. All of the particles are identical with radius R and mass M , and the shape of the system is rectangular with the length Lx and the width Ly\nsatisfying the inequality 2R < Ly < 4R. The schematic\nillustration of the system is given in Fig. 1, in which\nwe number particles 1, 2, * * * , N from the left to right in\nthis system. For the actual numerical results shown in\nthis paper, we used: the radius of a particle R = 1, the\nmass of a particle M = 1, the total energy of the system E = N , the system width Ly = 2R(1 + 10\u22126 ), and\nthe system length Lx = N Ly (1 + d) with the constant d\ncontrolling the density \u03c1 \u2261 N \u03c0R2 /(Lx Ly ). In the quasione-dimensional system, the particle interactions are restricted to nearest-neighbor particles only, so particles\nremain in the same order. These features require less calculation effort and a simpler representation of results for\n\nFIG. 1: A quasi-one-dimensional system consisting of harddisks with radius R. The length Lx and the width Ly of\nthe system control the density. The width Ly satisfies the\ninequality 2R < Ly < 4R, so that the disks remain in the\nsame order and particles can be numbered 1, 2, * * * , N from\nthe left to right.\n\nquasi-one-dimensional system compared with fully twodimensional systems. The quasi-one-dimensional system\nhas already been used to investigate the localized behavior of Lyapunov vectors [28, 34], the wave-like structure\nof Lyapunov vectors [18, 19, 21] and the transition between quasi-one-dimensional and fully two-dimensional\nsystems [36].\nThe dynamics of Lyapunov vectors in many-hard-disk\nsystems is well established, and readers should refer to\nthe references, for example, Ref. [41], for more detailed\ndiscussions. In many-hard-disk systems the dynamics is\nseparated into a free-flight part and a collision part, and\nthe free-flight part of the dynamics is integrable. This\nproperty allow us to express the dynamical evolution as\na simple multiplication of time-evolutional matrices for\nthe free-flight dynamics and the collision dynamics, leading to a fast and more accurate numerical simulation than\nfor soft-core interaction models. For numerical calculations of the Lyapunov vectors shown in this paper, we\nuse the algorithm developed by G. Benettin, et al [37]\nand I. Shimada and T. Nagashima [38] (also see Refs.\n[39, 40]). This algorithm is characterized by intermittent (e.g. after every collision) re-orthogonalization and\nrenormalization of Lyapunov vectors, preventing a divergence of the amplitude of the Lyapunov vectors.\nIn this paper we use the notation \u03b4\u0393 (n) (t) \u2261\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(\u03b4\u0393 1 (t), \u03b4\u0393 2 (t), * * * , \u03b4\u0393 N (t)) for the Lyapunov vector corresponding to the n-th Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(n) at\n(n)\ntime t. Here, \u03b4\u0393 j (t) is the Lyapunov vector component\ncontributed by the j-th particle in the n-th Lyapunov exponent at time t. To express the localized behavior of the\n(n)\nLyapunov vectors we introduce the quantity \u03b3j (t) as\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\u03b3j (t)\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03b4\u0393 j (t)\nN\nP\n\nk=1\n\n(n)\n\n2\n\n\u03b4\u0393 k (t)\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the normalized amplitude of the Lyapunov vector component for the j-th particle for the n-th Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(n) at time t. The localized behavior of Lyapunov vector, namely the Lyapunov localiza(n)\ntion, is the phenomenon where only a few of the \u03b3j (t),\nj = 1, 2, * * * , N have a non-zero value at any time t.\nFig. 2 is an example of the Lyapunov localization. It is\n(1)\na graph of the normalized amplitude \u03b3j of the Lyapunov\nvector components for the j-th particle corresponding\nto the largest Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(1) as a function of\nthe particle index j and the collision number nt (\u2248 t/\u03c4\nwith time t and the mean free time \u03c4 ). The system is\n\n\f3\n\n(1)\n\nFIG. 2: The normalized amplitude \u03b3j of the Lyapunov vector particle component corresponding to the largest Lyapunov\nexponent as a function of the collision number nt and the particle index j in a quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk system with\nd = 105 and N = 50. On the base of this graph is a contour\n(1)\nplot of \u03b3j at the level 0.2.\n\na quasi-one-dimensional system consisting of 50 harddisks and with d = 105 (the density \u03c1 \u2248 7.85 \u00d7 10\u22126 ).\nFrom this figure we recognize that the non-zero components of the Lyapunov vector are concentrated at two\nnearest-neighbor particles. This characteristic is shown\nfor hard-disk systems at low density and for large Lyapunov exponents in general, using the Lyapunov localization spectrum [28, 34]. Moreover, we observe that such\nlocalized regions of Lyapunov vector components move\nwith time in discrete jumps or hops, in Fig. 2. This\ncharacteristic hopping has already been shown in Ref.\n[28] and that such spatial hopping of the non-zero com(n)\nponents of \u03b3j (t) are caused by some particle-particle\ncollisions. However, not every collision causes a hopping\nof the localized Lyapunov vector. In this sense, particle collisions themselves are not sufficient to explain the\nhopping movement of the Lyapunov localization.\nThe Lyapunov localization appears in the Lyapunov\nvectors corresponding to large Lyapunov exponents in\ngeneral, but in this paper for simplicity we consider only\nthe Lyapunov vector \u03b4\u0393 (1) corresponding to the largest\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb(1) .\n\nIII.\n\nHOPPING RATE OF LOCALIZED\nLYAPUNOV VECTORS\n\nAn advantage of the quasi-one-dimensional system in\ninvestigations of Lyapunov localization is that the movement of particles in the transverse direction are suppressed, and roughly speaking, the particle sequence corresponds to the particle's position. Noting this feature,\nin this section we describe the hopping behavior of spatially localized Lyapunov vectors as the hopping of par(n)\nticle indices whose \u03b3j defined by Eq. (1) have non-zero\nvalues.\nAs shown in Refs. [28, 34] the particle indices with\n(1)\nnon-zero \u03b3j are a pair of nearest-neighbor particles in\nthe low density limit, and we can introduce the hopping\ndistance h at each collision as the change of particle indices. In this definition the hopping distance h is an\ninteger number satisfying the inequality \u2212[N/2] \u2264 h \u2264\n[N/2], where [x] is the integer part of the real number\nx. It should also be noted that we take the particle\nindex j as the one equivalent to the index j \u00b1 N , because of periodic boundary conditions, so the hopping\ndistance h \u00b1 N is equivalent to h. More technical details\nof the calculation of the hopping distance h are given\nin Appendix A. Using this hopping distance h, in numerical simulations, we count the number NT (h) of hops\n\nFIG. 3: The normalized hopping rates PN (h)/PN (1) for\nquasi-one-dimensional systems of different sizes at the same\ndensity (d = 103 ) as a function of the hopping distance |h|.\nThe number of particles is N = 25 (circles), 50 (triangles),\nand 75 (squares).

In this paper we use the hopping rate PN (h)/PN (1) = limT \u2192\u221e NT (h)/NT (1) normalized by PN (1). From the reflection symmetry of the\nquasi-one-dimensional system in the longitudinal direction, the hopping rate PN (h) must be symmetric, namely\nPN (h) = PN (\u2212h). We use this hopping rate to quantitatively discuss the hopping dynamics for localized Lyapunov vectors.\nFigure 3 shows log-log plots of the hopping rates\nPN (h)/PN (1) normalized by PN (1) as a function of |h| in\na quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk system with d = 103\nat different numbers of particles; N = 25 (circles), 50 (triangles), and 75 (squares). Noting the symmetric property PN (\u2212h) = PN (h), we use |PN (h) \u2212 PN (\u2212h)|/PN (1)\nas error bars in Fig. 3. It is clear from Fig. 3 that\nthe hopping rate PN (|h|) decreases as |h| increases. This\nimplies that there is a spatial correlation among the localized regions of a Lyapunov vector, rather than a random\nhopping.\nThe turn-up in the tail of the normalized hopping\nrate PN (h)/PN (1) in Fig. 3 can be explained as an\neffect of periodic boundary conditions. Under periodic\nboundary conditions the hopping distance h + jN for\nany integer j is observed as the hopping distance h in\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system consisting of N hard\ndisks. Therefore, using the hopping rate P\u221e (h) for the\nthermodynamics limit (N \u2192 \u221e at a fixed density) for\nh = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, * * * \u00b1 \u221e, the hopping rate PN (h) for a\nfinite system should be represented as\nPN (h) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP\u221e (h + jN )\n\n(2)\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nfor h = \u2212[N/2], \u2212[N/2] + 1, * * * , [N/2]. The terms on the\nright-hand side of Eq. (2) with j 6= 0 cause the turn-up\nin the tail of the hopping rate PN (h) for a finite system.\nIn this sense we can explain the N -dependence of the\nhopping rate PN (h) using an N -independent asymptotic\ndistribution P\u221e (h). To make this explanation convincing\nwe fitted the numerical data for PN (h)/PN (1) shown in\nP\nFig. 3 to the function f (h) \u2261 \u03b1[h\u03b2 + 2j=1 (|h+jN |\u03b2 +|h\u2212\njN |\u03b2 )] assuming that the decay of P\u221e (h) = \u03b1|h|\u03b2 with\nfitting parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, and neglecting the higher\norder small terms for |j| \u2265 3. Here, the fitting lines are\ndotted for N = 25, the broken for N = 50 and solid for\nN = 75. Note that these sets (\u03b1, \u03b2) of fitting parameter\nvalues, summarized in Table I, are almost independent\n\n\f4\n\nTABLE I: Fitting parameters for the power function P\u221e (h) =\n\u03b1|h|\u03b2 for quasi-one dimensional systems of different numbers\nof particles N with d = 103 .

In Appendix A we show that the normalized hopping rate PN (h)/PN (1) is almost density-independent at\nleast for 103 < d < 105 , (namely in the density region\n7.85 \u00d7 10\u22126 < \u03c1 < 7.85 \u00d7 10\u22124 ). However, a subtle\nincrease of the normalized hopping rate as the density\ndecreases is recognizable in this low density region.\nIV.\n\nBRICK ACCUMULATION MODEL\n\nAs shown in Sec. III the hopping rate of the localized\nregion of the Lyapunov vector is correlated spatially. In\nthis section we explain this characteristic using a simple\none-dimensional model, which we call the brick accumulation model.\nA schematic illustration of the brick accumulation\nmodel, or simply the brick model, is given in Fig. 4. It is\na one-dimensional model with N sites in the horizontal\ndirection. The bricks are dropped at random and occupy\na pair of neighboring sites. Each brick has width two and\nthe height 1 and they accumulate at sites without overlap. The dynamics of the brick model is described using\nthe brick height Kj (n) at the j-th site after n bricks have\nbeen dropped. The total brick height Kj (n) takes on integer values and its dynamics is expressed as follows. If\nthe n-th brick is dropped on sites jn and jn + 1 then\n\uf8f1\nmax {Kjn (n \u2212 1), Kjn +1 (n \u2212 1)} + 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nif l \u2208 {jn , jn + 1}\n(3)\nKl (n) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nKl (n \u2212 1) if l \u2208\n/{jn , jn + 1}\n(noting that the particle index N + 1 is equivalent to 1).\nHere the site number jn is chosen randomly on [1, N ] for\neach n.\n\nOne may notice that the brick accumulation model is\na one-dimensional version of the so-called clock model\n[31, 32, 33], which has been used to calculate the Lyapunov exponents for many-hard-disk systems. In the\nclock model, the brick height Kj (n) is usually called the\nclock value of the j-th particle after the n-th particleparticle collision, and the dynamics (3) is expressed as\nan adjustment of the clock values of colliding particles.\nHowever we use the name brick accumulation model for\nthe one-dimensional version of the clock model, because\nin a simple image of brick accumulations, it is easily to\nvisualize the configuration of brick heights which is essential for the analytical approach to the hopping rate\ndiscussed in the next section V, although this image is applicable only for the one-dimensional case. The image of\nbrick accumulations also helps us to easily recognize the\nsimilarity of this model to ballistic aggregation models,\nwhose scaling properties have been studied analytically\nand numerically [42, 43].\nIn the brick model described by the brick height Kj (n),\nthe site number j corresponds to the particle index, and\nthe number n of dropped bricks corresponds to the collision number nt for the quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk\nsystem. Moreover, the brick height Kj (n) itself is connected to the Lyapunov vector component amplitude\n(1)\n|\u03b4\u0393 j (t)| by\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b4\u0393 j (\u03c4 nt ) \u223c \u03b4\u0393 j (0) exp {\u2212Kj (nt ) ln \u03c1}\n\n(4)\n\nfor the particle index j and the collision number nt with\nthe mean free time \u03c4 in the asymptotic limit of low density \u03c1 \u2192 0. The derivation of the relation (4) from microscopic dynamics for hard-particle systems is given in\nAppendix B.\nFrom the relation (4) between the brick height and\nthe Lyapunov vector, the amplitude of the localized Lyapunov vector components with the highest brick height\nhave much larger values than the other components because of the huge factor \u2212 ln \u03c1 appearing in the exponent\nof Eq. (4) at low density \u03c1 << 1. Therefore, to a good\n(n)\napproximation, the normalized amplitude \u03b3j given by\nEq. (1) has non-zero components only for particles corresponding to these largest amplitudes, as shown in Fig.\n2. The combination of Eqs. (3) and (4) also explains\nwhy the amplitudes of the localized components of the\nLyapunov vectors for nearest-neighbor particles take almost the same value, thus appearing as a flat top in the\nlocalized regions in Fig. 2. After all, the localized region of the Lyapunov vector represented in Eq. (4) is\ngiven as the site indices whose brick height Kj (nt ) take\nthe maximum value after the n-th brick is dropped, and\nsuch sites with the highest brick height can be calculated\nusing the brick model dynamics (3) only, without referring to the hard-disk dynamics. Based on these features\nwe can calculate the hopping distance h for the brick accumulation model (see the end of Appendix A for more\ndetail of the hopping distance for the brick model), and\ntherefore the hopping rate PN (h), similarly to the quasione-dimensional hard-disk system.\nFigure 5 shows the normalized hopping rates\nPN (h)/PN (1) for the brick model with 50 sites (cir-\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 5: Normalized hopping rates PN (h)/PN (1) for the brick\nmodel (circles) and the quasi-one-dimensional system with\nd = 105 (squares) as a function of the absolute value of hopping distance |h| for N = 50 as log-log plots. The error bars\nare given by |PN (h) \u2212 PN (\u2212h)|/PN (1). The broken line is the\nanalytical expression for the hopping rate discussed in Sec.\nV.\n\nPN\nFIG. 6: The sum\nj=1 Kj (n) of brick heights Kj (n) as a\nfunction of the number n of dropped bricks in the brick accumulation model with N = 50 in the n interval [0, 20979999].\nInset: The same graph but enlarged in the much smaller n\ninterval [1000, 1050].

Fig. 6 is the sum\nj=1 Kj (n) of\nbrick heights as a function of n. Note that this sum must\nincrease at a speed of more than 2 per dropped brick,\nbecause accumulated bricks capture spaces below them\nwhich cannot be occupied by further dropped bricks. It is\nclear from this figure that this sum increases linearly, and\nPN\na fit of the data to the function j=1 Kj (n) = \u03b1+\u03b2n with\nfitting parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 leads to the values \u03b1 \u2248 0.00\nand \u03b2 \u2248 3.99 [47]. (Note that data points in the main\ngraph of Fig. 6 look exactly like this fit because of the\nlarge scale. In the inset to Fig. 6 we show the graph of\nPN\nj=1 Kj (n) as a function of n on a much smaller scale,\nto show its fluctuating behavior.) Therefore, on average,\neach dropped brick adds a contribution of 4 to the sum\nPN\nj=1 Kj (n), meaning that each brick occupies not only\nits own 2 spaces but also captures 2 empty spaces below\nit.\nIt is important to note that from Eq. (4) the brick\nheight Kj (n) dominates the exponential growth rate of\nthe Lyapunov vector component amplitude. Using this\nPN\nfeature of the brick heights, their sum j=1 Kj (n) is connected to the largest Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(1) as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nN\nX\n1\n1\n\uf8f0\nKj (n)\uf8fb ln \u03c1\n(5)\n\u03bb(1) \u223c \u2212 lim\nn\u2192+\u221e n\u03c4\nN j=1\n\nN\n25\n50\n75\n100\n\nHard-disk model\nPN (0)/PN (1)\n13.5\n26.8\n39.6\n52.1\n\nBrick model\nPN (0)/PN (1)\n17.1\n37.9\n58.8\n79.7\n\ncles) and for a quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk system\nconsisting of 50 hard-disks and d = 105 (squares).\nAgreement between the brick model and the quasi-onedimensional hard-disk system for the normalized hopping\nrate PN (h)/PN (1) for |h| \u2264 1 is satisfactory. Numerical\nsimulations of quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems\nshow that the normalized hopping rate PN (h)/PN (1) increases very slightly as the density decreases as shown in\nAppendix A, so the deviation of PN (h)/PN (1) in tails in\nthe brick model and the hard-disk system in Fig. 5 may\nbe a finite density effect.\nSo far we have discussed the hopping rate PN (h) for\nnon-zero hopping distances h 6= 0. Now we discuss the\nhopping rate PN (0) for zero hopping distance h = 0. Table II shows the ratio PN (0)/PN (1) for the hopping rates\nat h = 0 and 1 in the quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk\nsystem with d = 103 and the brick accumulation model\nfor N = 25, 50, 75 and 100. As shown in this table, the ratio PN (0)/PN (1) depends on the number of particles N ,\nand roughly speaking it is proportional to N . To explain\nthis linear dependence of PN (0)/PN (1) with respect to\nN , we note that in the brick model the hopping distance\n1 occurs only when a new brick is dropped at one (and not\nboth) of the sites with the highest brick height, meaning\nthat the hopping rate PN (1) should be approximately\ninversely proportional to N . On the other hand, the\nhopping distance 0 occurs when a new brick is dropped\nat a site which does not have the highest nor the second highest brick height, or is dropped at both the sites\nwhich are currently the site of the highest brick height,\nmeaning that the hopping rate PN (0) should be, roughly\nspeaking, independent of N . These considerations for\nPN (0) and PN (1) explain why the ratio PN (0)/PN (1) is\nproportional to N . However we need a more detailed\nconsideration to explain the difference between the coefficient \u03ba in the relation PN (0)/PN (1) \u2248 \u03baN between the\n\nwith the mean free time \u03c4 and the density \u03c1 in the asymptotic limit of low density. [More detailed discussion for\nthe formula (5) is given in Appendix B.] As a numerical\ncheck of the formula (5) we show in Fig. 7, the largest\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb(1) as a function of the density \u03c1 in a\nquasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems and in the brick\naccumulation model using the formula (5) with N = 50.\nHere, to calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent from\nPN\nEq. (5) we used the relation j=1 Kj (n) \u2248 4n as shown\nin Fig. 6, and the values of the mean free time \u03c4 and\nthe density \u03c1 of the quasi-one-dimensional system whose\nLyapunov exponents are plotted in Fig. 7, and the data\npoints are connected by a dashed line for ease of visibility.\nFigure 7 shows that Eq. (5) reproduces successfully the\nvalues of the largest Lyapunov exponent for the quasione-dimensional hard-disk systems, not only in the limit\nof low density but also at relatively high density such as\n\u03c1 < 0.3.

The hopping rate P\u0303\u221e (h) is calculated as the\nsummation of this probability distribution over possible values of kl , l = 1, 2, * * * , h \u2212 1.\n\nANALYTICAL EXPRESSION FOR THE\nHOPPING RATE\n\nIn this section we discuss another approach to the hopping rate of the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors.\nThis approach is inspired by some of the characteristics\nof the brick accumulation model discussed in Sec. IV, although we greatly simplified the brick model by omitting\nsome other aspects of the model. The advantage of this\napproach is that we can get an analytical expression for\nthe hopping rate, while to a good approximation it still\nreproduces the hopping rate for hard-disk systems. Another important point in this approach is that it connects\nthe dynamics of the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors with a static property, the probability distribution of\nbrick-height differences between nearest-neighbor sites.\nIn the brick accumulation model, a hop of the highest\nbrick site occurs when two (non-nearest-neighbor) sites\nhave the same brick height. Noting this characteristic\nwe consider the probability distribution P\u0303\u221e (h) under the\nconstraint that the two sites \u03bc and \u03bc+ h have the highest\nbrick height. We require that there is no other highest\nsite between the two highest sites \u03bc and \u03bc + h for |h| \u2265 2;\nKl (n) < K\u03bc (n) [= K\u03bc+h (n)],\n\uf8f1\n\u03bc + 1, \u03bc + 2, * * * , \u03bc + h \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nfor h \u2265 2\nin l =\n(6)\n\u03bc\n+\nh + 1, \u03bc + h + 3, * * * , \u03bc \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nfor h \u2264 \u22122,\n\nUsing this probability distribution P\u0303\u221e (h), we can estimate the hopping rate P\u221e (h) in the thermodynamic\nlimit as the one proportional to P\u0303\u221e (h): P\u221e (h) \u221d P\u0303\u221e (h).\nThen we can calculate the hopping rate PN (h) for a finite\nsize system using Eq. (2), apart from a constant factor.\nTo calculate the probability distribution P\u0303\u221e (h) we introduce the distribution \u039b(k) of brick-height differences\nk between nearest-neighbor sites. These two distribution\nfunctions are connected by\nX\nX\nX\nP\u0303\u221e (h) =\n***\nk1\nk2\n(k1 \u22651) (k1 +k2 \u22651)\n\nIn Eq. (7), \u2212kl is a brick-height difference of nearest neighbor sites (l = 1, 2, * * * , |h| \u2212 1). The probability distribution for the specific brick-height configuration with kl , l = 1, 2, * * * , |h| \u2212 1 is given by\nP|h|\u22121\n\u039b(\u2212k1 )\u039b(\u2212k2 )\u039b(\u2212k3 ) * * * \u039b(\u2212k|h|\u22121 )\u039b( j=1 kj ), and\nthe hopping rate P\u0303\u221e (h) is calculated as the summation\nof this probability distribution over possible values of kl ,\nl = 1, 2, * * * , h \u2212 1, leading to Eq. (7). Figure 8 is a\nschematic illustration of a brick-height configuration connecting two highest sites and the brick-height differences\n\u2212kj of nearest neighbor sites in the case of h \u2265 2. In Eq.\n(7), the lower bounds of the sums on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (7) come from the condition (6). Note that from\nEq. (7) the distribution P\u0303\u221e (h) is an even function of h,\nnamely P\u0303\u221e (\u2212h) = P\u0303\u221e (h).\nNow, for simplicity, we assume that the distribution\nfunction \u039b(k) can be expressed as an exponential function\n\u039b(k) = W exp{\u2212\u03b7|k|}\n\n(8)\n\nwith constants W and \u03b7 (> 0).

(20) the second condition (19) gives\n(\n)\n\u221a\n1 + 1 + \u2206K2\n\u03b7 = ln\n,\n\u2206K\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nsatisfying the inequality \u03b7 > 0. Inserting Eq. (21) into\nEqs. (10) and (20) we obtain\n\u00132\n\u2206K\n\u221a\n\u03a5 =\n1 + 1 + \u2206K2\n\u221a\n1 + 1 + \u2206K2 \u2212 \u2206K\n\u221a\n.\nW =\n1 + 1 + \u2206K2 + \u2206K\n\u0012\n\nspace below the brick which can now not be occupied by\nother bricks. This implies that the averaged brick-height\ndifference between nearest-neighbor sites is about 2, so\nthat\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nFrom Eqs. (22) and (23), there is only one parameter\n\u2206K remaining to determine the hopping rate using Eq.\n(11).\nTo estimate the value of \u2206K, we use a property of\nthe brick accumulation model discussed at the end of\nSec. IV. Previously, we showed an approximate rePN\nlation\nj=1 Kj (n) \u2248 4n for the sum of brick heights,\nwhich means that in the brick accumulation model each\ndropped brick gives a mean contribution of 4 to this sum.\nThis contribution consists of a contribution of 2 as the\nspace occupied by a brick itself and another 2 as empty\n\n(24)\n\nWe use this value to calculate the hopping rate based\non Eq. (11). One may notice that from the relation\nPN\nj=1 Kj (n) \u2248 (\u2206K + 2)n and the formula (5) we obtain\n\u2206K \u223c\n\nN \u03c4 (1)\n\u03bb \u22122\nln \u03c1\n\n(25)\n\nin the limit of low density. From the relation (25) between\nthe parameter \u2206K specifying the hopping rate and the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(1) , the hopping rate of the\nlocalized region of the Lyapunov vectors is connected to\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent.\nBefore comparing the hopping rate based on the analytical expression (11) with the ones for hard-disk systems and the brick accumulation model, we note that\nthis analytical expression for the hopping rate may not\nbe appropriate for small hopping distances |h|. In particular, it does not give the correct value of PN (1), because\nin the brick model the hopping distance h = \u00b11 does not\nappear from separated highest sites with the same brick\nheight, the assumption used to derive Eq. (11). Therefore it is not appropriate to calculate the hopping rate\nnormalized by PN (1) from this analytical expression and\nto compare it with the numerical results. The hopping\nrate PN (\u00b12) from Eq. (11) may also be problematic, because in the brick model the hopping distance h = \u00b12\noccurs when 4 consecutive sites have the highest brick\nheight, while to derive Eq. (11) we assumed that h = \u00b12\noccurs when non-consecutive separate sites \u03bc and \u03bc + h\nhave the same highest brick height. Based on these considerations we do not calculate the value PN (\u00b11) from\nthe analytical approach in this section, and plot the hopping rate so that PN (5) by Eq. (11) gives the same value\nas that from the brick model.\nIn Fig.\n5 for the normalized hopping rate\nPN (h)/PN (1), we plotted the function \u03a8(h) \u2261\nP\u0303N (h)PN (5)/[P\u0303N (5)PN (1)] using the value PN (5)/PN (1)\nof the brick model with P\u0303N (h) = P\u0303\u221e (h) + P\u0303\u221e (N \u2212 h)\nusing the analytical expression P\u0303\u221e (h) given by Eq. (11)\nfor |h| \u2265 2. Note \u03a8(5) = PN (5)/PN (1) so that \u03a8(h) coincides with PN (h)/PN (1) of the brick model at |h| = 5.\nHere, the value of the hopping rate values are given at\ninteger values of h, but we connect them with a broken\nline for ease of visibility. Figure 5 shows that the analytical expression (11) for the hopping rate reproduces the\nhopping rate for the brick accumulation model as well\nas the quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk system to a good\napproximation. It may be noted that for this plot we\nused the first two dominant terms on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (2), and part of the small deviation of the hopping\nrate in the tail between the brick model and the analytical expression should come from the omission of higher\norder terms in Eq. (2).\nWe notice that the approach in this section is simple enough to get an analytical expression for the hopping rate but it is not completely consistent with the\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 9: The distribution \u039b(k) of the brick-height differences\nk between nearest-neighbor sites as a function of |k| in the\nbrick accumulation model with\nP N = 50 as a linear-log plot.\nHere, \u039b(k) is normalized by 2N\nk=\u22122N \u039b(k) = 1. The distribution \u039b(k) is an even function of k, and the error bars in this\ngraph are given by |\u039b(k) \u2212 \u039b(\u2212k)|. The line is an exponential function used to obtain the analytical expression for the\nhopping rate given by Eqs. (8), (22), (23) and (24).\n\nbrick accumulation model discussed in the previous section IV. Previously, we have mentioned the irrelevance\nof Eq. (11) as a description of a small hopping rate in\nthe brick model. Actually, in the approach of this section we omitted the essential characteristic of the bricks\nas components of the brick accumulation model, except\nfor the property (24), and treated the model components\nas blocks (or half bricks). As another example, we show\nin Fig. 9 the numerical result for the distribution \u039b(k) of\nbrick-height differences k between nearest-neighbor sites\nin the brick accumulation model with N = 50. Here,\nP\n\u039b(k) is normalized by 2N\nk=\u22122N \u039b(k) = 1, instead of Eq.\n(18), because we cannot calculate \u039b(k) in |k| \u2192 +\u221e\nnumerically. In this figure we added the exponential distribution (8) using Eqs. (22), (23) and (24). Figure 9\nshows that the probability distribution \u039b(k) does not coincide with an exponential distribution (8), although it\nmay be justified as a first approximation. (On the other\nhand, the numerical evaluation of \u2206K from the distribution \u039b(k) as a numerical result in Fig. 9 gives the value\n1.99, then Eq. (24) is still justified.) On another point,\nin the brick model the highest brick sites appear as a\npair of nearest-neighbor sites, but we did not take into\naccount this characteristic in the analytical approach in\nthis section. Despite the omission of characteristics of the\nbrick accumulation model, the analytical approach in this\nsection reproduces the hopping rate for many-hard-disk\nsystems reasonably well, and it suggests that this approach still keeps enough of the essential characteristics\nthat describe the dynamics of the Lyapunov localization.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION AND REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we discussed the dynamics of the spatially localized region of the Lyapunov vector corresponding to the largest Lyapunov exponent in a quasi-onedimensional hard-disk system. To discuss the dynamics\nof the localized region of the Lyapunov vector we introduced a hopping rate for the localized region, and showed\nthat the hopping rate decreases as the absolute value of\nhopping distance increases. This hopping-distance dependence of the hopping rate was explained quantitatively in two ways: a brick accumulation model and an\nanalytical approach. In the brick accumulation model,\nthe hopping behavior of the localized Lyapunov vectors\nwas explained as the movement of the highest position\nin the brick accumulations. It was shown that using this\nbrick model we can calculate the largest Lyapunov ex-\n\nFIG. 10: The distribution D(\u03c3 * \u2206p) of the quantity \u03c3 * \u2206p\nwith the normalized collision vector \u03c3 and the momentum\ndifference \u2206p of colliding particles just before the collision;\nfor the general case (dashed line) and for the case in which\nnon-zero hopping of a localized Lyapunov vector occurs. The\nsystem is a quasi-one-dimensional system with d = 103 and\nN = 25.\n\nponent for quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems successfully. On the other hand, in the analytical approach\nthe hopping rate was calculated from probability distributions for brick height differences of nearest neighbor\nsites via multiple summations over possible configurations that connect two separated highest sites. The result\nis related to the largest Lyapunov exponent. Both of the\napproaches successfully reproduced the hopping-distance\ndependence of the hopping rate for the localized Lyapunov vectors of quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems.\nAs a remark, it may be useful to mention a previous conjecture for the dynamics of the localized region\nof Lyapunov vectors corresponding to largest Lyapunov\nexponent. Before we started this work, there had been a\nview that the origin of the hopping behavior of localized\nLyapunov vectors was:\nhConjecturei The localized region of the Lyapunov vector\nhops to the position of a new grazing collision.\nThis conjecture was suggested from the fact that a change\nof Lyapunov vectors in particle collisions may be dominated by the factor 1/(\u03c3 * \u2206p) in the collision dynamics\nfor Lyapunov vector (see Appendix B), where \u03c3 is the\nnormalized collision vector and \u2206p is the momentum difference of the colliding particles before the collision. In\nthis argument, if two particles collide at a small angle (a\ngrazing collision) with a small value of \u03c3 * \u2206p, then the\nLyapunov vector can change significantly and the position of the localized region may move. However, this scenario cannot be correct for the following reasons. First,\nthis conjecture implies that as the position at which a\ngrazing collision occurs is random, the hopping distance\nshould also be random. This contradicts our numerical result that the hopping rate decreases with increasing hopping distance, as shown in Fig. 3. Second, we\nshow in Fig. 10, the distribution D(\u03c3 * \u2206p) of \u03c3 * \u2206p\nin general collisions (dashed line), and the distribution\nof collisions causing hopping of the localized Lyapunov\nvector (solid line) [48]. It is clear from Fig. 10 that the\nquantity \u03c3 * \u2206p is not smaller in collisions which lead to\njumps of the localized region of Lyapunov vector compared with the general case. It may also be noted that\nthe hopping dynamics of the Lyapunov vector from the\nbrick accumulation model described in Sec. IV is independent of collision parameters like collision angles, the\nmomentum difference of colliding particles, and also the\nquantity \u03c3 * \u2206p. This also suggests that the conjecture\nfor the origin of the hopping of the localized region of\nthe Lyapunov vector cannot be justified. On the other\n\n\f9\n\nhand, this collision parameter independence of the hopping behavior in the brick model cannot explain why the\ndistribution D(\u03c3 * \u2206p) is different from the general case\nand the hopping case in Fig. 10. This is an open problem.\nAs another open problem, the fits in Fig. 3 suggest\nthat the hopping-distance dependence of the hopping\nrate in the thermodynamic limit seems to be a power\nlaw: P\u221e (h) \u223c h\u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2248 1.7. It remains to be determined whether this power behavior of the hopping rate\ncan be justified analytically in the brick accumulation\nmodel or the analytical approach discussed in Sec. V.\nIn this paper we showed that the hopping rate of the\nlocalized region of a Lyapunov vector, and the largest\nLyapunov exponent, are well described by the brick accumulation model. Then, one may ask a more direct\nnumerical check of the justification of the brick accumulation model in quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems,\nfor example, to check Eq. (4) or to observe numerically\nan actual brick configuration like that presented in Fig.\n4. However, such a check of the brick model is not trivial\nfor the following reasons. First, the brick accumulation\nmodel is only justified in the limit of low density, but\nnumerical simulations have to be at some finite density.\nThis effect appears, for example, as gradual changes of\nthe Lyapunov vector component amplitudes, as shown\nin Fig. 11, which do not appear in the brick accumulation model. Second, even if we could simulate at an\nextremely low density in which such finite density effects\ncan be neglected (although the case presented in this paper is not at such a low density), the factor \u2212 ln \u03c1 in Eq.\n(4) may be too large for an actual numerical calculation.\nFinally, to calculate Lyapunov vectors in this paper we\nused the algorithm developed by Benettin et al [39, 40].\nThis algorithm includes intermittent renormalizations of\nLyapunov vectors, to prevent a divergence of the amplitudes of Lyapunov vectors in numerical calculations,\nbut the brick accumulation model does not have such a\nnormalization procedure in its dynamics. This difference\nmakes a direct numerical check of Eq. (4) difficult in\nhard-disk systems. Different from Eq. (4) itself, the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors, which is required\nto calculate the hopping rate, is given simply by particle indices with the largest Lyapunov vector component\namplitude, which is not influenced by such a difference\nof normalization procedure in calculations of Lyapunov\nvectors.\nIn this paper, in order to introduce the hopping rate\nwe used the property of quasi-one-dimensional systems,\nthat the order of particles is an invariant. In this sense,\nit is not trivial to generalize our argument to fully two(or three-) dimensional systems. An effective way to describe the dynamics for the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors for higher spatial dimensions remains an\nimportant future problem. Related to this it should still\nbe noted that it is known that the clock model version of\nthe brick accumulation model itself can be easily generalized to any spatial dimensional case, although in higher\ndimension we do not have the concept of the accumulation of bricks, as we do for the quasi-one-dimensional\ncase.\n\nFinally, one should notice that the brick accumulation model (more generally the clock model) used in this\npaper has been justified for hard-disk (or hard-sphere)\nsystems only (at least so far). On the other hand, the\nLyapunov localization is observed not only in manyhard-disk systems but also in a wide variety of manybody chaotic systems, such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nmodel [22], a random matrix model [24], map systems\n[23, 25, 44, 45], coupled nonlinear oscillators [26], etc.\nIt should be an important future problem to develop approaches to the dynamics of Lyapunov localization in this\nwider class of systems.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nOne of the authors (T.T) wishes to thank to R. van\nZon, who indicated the possibility of describing the hopping dynamics for the localized Lyapunov vectors using the clock model, and supplied a computer program\nfor the clock model. We also appreciate helpful discussions with E. Zabey and J. -P. Eckmann. In particular,\nthey suggested the importance of the difference of brick\nheights for nearest-neighbor sites in the calculation of the\nhopping rate, and posed a question about the behavior of\nthe sum of brick heights as shown in Fig. 6, and also indicated the analogy between the brick accumulation model\nand ballistic aggregation models.

[28, 34], the normalized Lyapunov\nvectors corresponding to the large Lyapunov exponents\nhave non-zero components for only two particles in the\nlow density limit, and changes of the non-zero components are caused by particle-particle collisions. Applying\nthis characteristic of the Lyapunov vector to the quasione-dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions, we can introduce a hopping distance h[n] at the\nn-th particle-particle collision as\n\u001b\n\u001a\njn+1 \u2212 jn\nh[n] = jn+1 \u2212 jn \u2212 N nint\n(A1)\nN\nin the low density limit. Here {jn , jn +1} are the non-zero\ncomponents before the n-th collision and {jn+1 , jn+1 +1}\nare the non-zero components just after the n-th collision.\nThe function nint{x} is the closest integer to the real\nnumber x. We assume that changes in the position of\nthe localized region of the Lyapunov vector are negligible during the free-flight interval, so {jn+1 , jn+1 + 1}\ncan also be interpreted as the set of the particle indices\n\n\f10\n\n(1)\n\nFIG. 11: The normalized amplitude \u03b3j\n\nof the Lyapunov vec-\n\n(1)\n\u03b4\u0393 j\n\ntor component\ncorresponding to the largest Lyapunov\n(1)\nexponent \u03bb\nas a function of the collision number nt and\nthe particle index j in a quasi-one-dimensional system with\nd = 104 and N = 50. Here, the collision number interval\nshown in this graph is [k, k + 68] with k = 3600448. On the\n(1)\nbase of this graph is a contour plot of \u03b3j at the level 0.2.\nThree hops of the localized region of the Lyapunov vector are\nvisible in this time interval; The first two hops are sharp and\nthe last one is gradually.\n\nwhose Lyapunov vector components take non-zero values just before the (n + 1)-th collision. We count the\nnumber of times NT (h) that we see a hop of size h in\na time-interval T where \u2212[N/2] \u2264 h \u2264 [N/2]. The\nnormalized hopping rate PN (h) can be introduced as\nPN (h)/PN (1) = limT \u2192\u221e NT (h)/NT (1).\nHowever, in actual numerical simulations, the particle\ndensity \u03c1 is always finite, and non-zero Lyapunov components of more than two particles can often be seen,\nat least down to a density \u03c1 \u2248 10\u22125 which is the low\ndensity limit of the numerical simulations in this paper.\nThis makes the above definition (A1) of the hopping distance h[n] impractical. To explain this point concretely\nwe show Fig. 11, which is a graph of the normalized\n(1)\nLyapunov vector component amplitude \u03b3j defined by\nEq. (1) as a function of the collision number nt and the\nparticle index j in a quasi-one-dimensional system with\nN = 50 and d = 104 , (namely a density \u03c1 \u2248 7.85 \u00d7 10\u22125).\nIn this figure we can recognize three types of hops of the\nlocalized region of the Lyapunov vector. The first two\nhops keep the non-zero Lyapunov vector components of\nalmost two particles sharp enough to apply the definition\n(A1) of the hopping distance, but the third hop occurs\ngradually so that no clear hopping time can be determined. Note that the localized region of Lyapunov vector\ncomponent amplitudes in the three dimensional plot 11\nalways has a flat top with a width of two-particles even\nfor the third hop in Fig. (11).\nIn this paper, for concrete calculations, we define the\nlocalized region of the Lyapunov vector components as\n(n)\nthe particle indices j for which \u03b3j > 0.2. (Here, we\nuse the similarity between particle positions and particle indices given in Fig. 1 for the quasi-one-dimensional\nsystem.) In Fig. 11, this localized region is approximately given by the region surrounded by the contour\nlines (level 0.2) on the base of the graph. We introduce\nthe quantity ln as the number of particles satisfying the\n(n)\ninequality \u03b3j > 0.2 just before the n-th collision. Note\n(n)\n\u03b3j\n\n(n)\n\u03b3j ,\n\nso ln cannot be\n\u2264 1 by definition (1) of\nthat 0 \u2264\nlarger than 5. If ln is always 2 as in the low density limit,\nthen we can use the hopping distance definition (A1), but\nin numerical simulations at finite density ln > 2 can happen as shown in Fig. 11. The problem then is how do\nwe define the hopping distance h[n] at the n-th collision,\nwhen ln > 2.\nThe definitions of the hopping distance for each case\n\nFIG. 12: Schematic illustrations of the hopping types for\nthe localized region of the Lyapunov vector in quasi-onedimensional systems at low density. The contours represent\n(1)\nthe level \u03b3j = 0.2. (These are the contours on the base of\nFig. 11.) The vertical dotted line is collision number n at\nwhich the hopping distance of the localized Lyapunov vector is to be determined. The seven illustrations in this figure\nindicate: (a) the case of (ln , ln+1 ) = (2, 2), (b1) the case of\n(ln , ln+1 ) = (2, 3), (b2) the case of (ln , ln+1 ) = (3, 2), (b3) the\ncase of (ln , ln+1 ) = (3, 3), (c1) the case of (ln , ln+1 ) = (2, 4),\n(c2) the case of (ln , ln+1 ) = (4, 2), and (c3) the case of\n(ln , ln+1 ) = (4, 4), where ln is the number of particles in the\nlocalized region of Lyapunov vector just before the n-th collision. The numbers in the right-bottom of each illustration\ngive the possible values of the hopping distance.\n\nare categorized as follows.\nhCase (a): ln = 2 \u2192 ln+1 = 2 i Here only two particle\nindices are in the localized region before and after the collision, and they are always nearestneighbors, so the hopping distance h[n] is given by\nEq. (A1).\nhCase (b1): ln = 2 \u2192 ln+1 = 3 i Here we assume that\nthe localized regions of the Lyapunov vector are\ngiven by {jn , jn + 1}, {jn+1 , jn+1 + 1, jn+1 + 2} and\njn+1 = jn or jn+1 = jn \u2212 1. We take the value\nof the hopping distance to be 1 (-1) for h[n] where\njn+1 = jn (jn+1 = jn \u2212 1).\nhCase (b2): ln = 3 \u2192 ln+1 = 2 i In this case we assume\nthat the localized regions of the Lyapunov vector\nare given by {jn , jn + 1, jn + 2}, {jn+1 , jn+1 + 1}\nand jn+1 = jn or jn+1 = jn + 1, and the hopping\ndistance is 0 in both cases.\nhCase (b3): ln = 3 \u2192 ln+1 = 3 i In this case we assume\nthat the localized regions of the Lyapunov vector are given by {jn , jn + 1, jn + 2}, {jn+1 , jn+1 +\n1, jn+1 + 2} and jn+1 = jn + h[n] with the hopping distance h[n] . We take into account the case\nh[n] = \u22121, 0 or 1 only.\nhCase (c1): ln = 2 \u2192 ln+1 = 4 i In this case we assume\nthat the localized regions of the Lyapunov vector are given by {jn , jn + 1}, {jn+1 , jn+1 + 1}\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand {jn+1\n, jn+1\n+ 1} satisfying jn+1\n= jn and\n\u2032\n|jn+1 \u2212 jn+1 | \u2265 2. The hopping distance is defined\nby Eq. (A1) using these jn+1 and jn .\nhCase (c2): ln = 4 \u2192 ln+1 = 2 i In this case we assume\nthat the localized regions of the Lyapunov vector are given by {jn , jn + 1}, {jn\u2032 , jn\u2032 + 1} and\n{jn+1 , jn+1 + 1} satisfying |jn \u2212 jn\u2032 | \u2265 2 and\n|jn \u2212 jn+1 | \u2264 1. The hopping distance h[n] is\nh[n] = jn+1 \u2212 jn = \u22121, 0 or 1.\nhCase (c3): ln = 4 \u2192 ln+1 = 4 i In this case we consider\nonly the case in which the localized regions of Lyapunov vector are given by {jn , jn + 1}, {jn\u2032 , jn\u2032 + 1},\n\n\f11\n\nAPPENDIX B: CLOCK MODEL FOR\nMANY-HARD-PARTICLE SYSTEMS\nFIG. 13: Log-log plots of the normalized hopping rates\nPN (h)/PN (1) for a quasi-one-dimensional system of 50 harddisks as a function of the hopping distance |h| at different\ndensities, d = 103 (circles), 104 (triangles) and 105 (squares).\nThe density is a function of d given by \u03c1 = \u03c0R2 /[(1 + d)L2y ].\nThe error bars are given by |PN (h) \u2212 PN (\u2212h)|/PN (1).\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n{jn+1 , jn+1 + 1} and {jn+1\n, jn+1\n+ 1} satisfying\n\u2032\njn+1 = jn , jn+1\n= jn\u2032 and |jn \u2212 jn\u2032 | \u2265 2. The\nhopping distance takes the value 0 in this case.\n\n(For each case above, the corresponding schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 12.) Here, we use periodic boundary conditions for the particle index, so that\nthe localized regions {N, 1}, {N, 1, 2} and {N \u2212 1, N, 1}\nshould be translated to {0, 1}, {0, 1, 2} and {\u22121, 0, 1},\nrespectively, in the above definition of the hopping distance. In the examples shown in Fig. 11, the first two\nhops of the localized Lyapunov vector can be described\nas case (a), and the third hop is described as cases (c1)\nand (c2). Note that asymmetric definitions of hopping\ndistances h[n] between cases (c1) and (c2) [and similarly between cases (b1) and (b2)] are required so that\nwe can interpret the hopping distance of the third nonzero hop in Fig. 11 as only \u22122 in spite of it involving\nboth cases (c1) and (c2). Using the above hopping distance we count the number NT (h) of hops of distance\nh in time interval T , and introduce the normalized hopping rate as PN (h)/PN (1) \u2261 limT \u2192\u221e NT (h)/NT (1) for\nh = \u2212[N/2], \u2212[N/2] + 1, * * * , [N/2]. Notice that there\nare possibilities apart from those shown above, but it is\nobserved that in numerical simulations the probabilities\nof these are extremely small (for example, more than 96\npercent of all hops could be categorized this way).\nIn Fig. 13 we show the normalized hopping rate\nPN (h)/PN (1) in a quasi-one-dimensional system of 50\nhard-disks for d = 103 (circles), 104 (triangles) and\n105 (squares). The hopping rate is almost densityindependent in this low density range, although it may be\nvery slightly larger at the lowest density for |h| = 2, 3, * * * .\nWe also calculate the hopping rate for the brick accumulation model explained in Sec. IV in a similar way. In\nthe brick accumulation model we can introduce the localized region of the Lyapunov vectors as the site (particle)\nindices whose brick height are highest. For the brick\nmodel, cases (b1), (b2), and (b3) above cannot happen,\nand only cases (a), (c1), (c2) and (c3) above are taken\ninto account in the numerical calculations. It may be\nnoted that in the brick model, case (a) above can happen only when the hopping distance is \u22121, 0 or 1, and\nEq. (A1) alone is not enough to calculate the hopping\ndistance. This is another reason to take into account\nthe case where ln > 2 in the calculation of the hopping\ndistance.\n\nHere we give an extension of the derivation of the clock\nmodel for the Lyapunov vector dynamics in many-hardparticle systems in the limit of low density. We also derive the formula (5) for the largest Lyapunov exponent\nfrom the clock model. The one-dimensional version of the\nclock model is the brick accumulation model used in this\npaper. In particular, we clarify the assumptions needed\nto justify the use of this model to discuss the Lyapunov\nlocalization. For the basic idea of the clock model, see,\nfor example, Refs. [32, 33]. However, note that in this\nappendix we use notation and assumptions that are a\nlittle different from these references, so that the derived\nclock model is consistent with the discussions in this paper and able to be compared with the numerical results\nof Ref. [28].\nWe consider a D-dimensional system with N harddisks (or hard-spheres, etc.) with identical radius R and\nmass M . We assume that there is no external field in\nthe system so that the dynamics is simply free-flights,\nand collisions between two particles. We put \u03b4q j (q j ) as\nthe spatial part of the Lyapunov vector component (the\nspatial coordinate) of the j-th particle, and \u03b4p j (p j ) as\nthe momentum part of the Lyapunov vector component\n(the momentum) of the j-th particle.\nWe take t = tn to be the time of the n-th collision\nwhich involves particles jn and kn , and define \u03c4n to be\n\u03c4n \u2261\n\ntn \u2212 tn\u22121\n,\nM\n\n(B1)\n\nso that the n-th free flight time is given by \u03c4n M . The\nfree flight part of dynamics of the Lyapunov vector is\nrepresented as\n+\n+\n\u03b4q j (t\u2212\nn ) = \u03b4q j (tn\u22121 ) + \u03c4n \u03b4p j (tn\u22121 ),\n\n\u03b4p j (t\u2212\nn)\n\n=\n\n\u03b4p j (t+\nn\u22121 )\n\n(B2)\n(B3)\n\nHere, the argument t\u00b1\nn refers to the limit of the quantity\nbefore the n-th collision (\u2212) or after the n-th collision\n(+).

For later use we note\nthat\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u03b4p jn (t+\nn ) + \u03b4p kn (tn ) = \u03b4p jn (tn ) + \u03b4p kn (tn ) (B14)\n\nwhich can be derived from Eqs. (B7) and (B8). For the\nderivation of Eqs. (B4), (B5), (B6), (B7), (B8) and (B9)\nfor the Lyapunov vector dynamics, for example, see Ref.\n[41].\nWe consider a low density case, in which the free flight\ntime \u03c4n M is large (as the free flight time is inversely\nproportional to the density). This justifies our first approximation for the Lyapunov vector:\n+\n\u03b4q j (t\u2212\nn ) \u223c \u03c4n \u03b4p j (tn\u22121 )\n\n(B15)\n\nin the limit of low density, the term containing \u03c4n is much\nlarger than the other term on the right-hand side of Eq.\n(B2).

(B3). Note that the spatial part\nof the Lyapunov vector does not appear in the dynamics described in (B17) and (B18), (B19) anymore. The\nfirst and second terms on the right-hand side of (B17)\nand (B18) are negligible compared with the third term\nbecause of the large value of \u03c4n , so we obtain\n+\n[n]\n\u03b4p jn (t+\nn ) \u223c \u03c4n Q \u03b4p kn jn (tn\u22121 ),\n\n\u03b4p kn (t+\nn)\n\n\u223c \u2212\u03c4n Q\n\n[n]\n\n\u03b4p kn jn (t+\nn\u22121 ),\n\n(B20)\n(B21)\n\nwhich lead to\n+\n\u03b4p jn (t+\nn ) + \u03b4p kn (tn ) \u223c 0.\n\n(B22)\n\n+\n\u03b4p jn (t+\nn\u22121 ) + \u03b4p kn (tn\u22121 )\n2\n+\n\u03b4p jn (t+\nn\u22121 ) \u2212 \u03b4p kn (tn\u22121 )\n+\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b4p jn kn (t+\n(t\n)\n+\n\u03b4p\n\u03b4p jn (t\u2212\nn\nkn n )\nn\u22121 )\n+\n=\n2\n2\n+\n+\n(t\n)\n)\n+\n\u03b4p\n\u03b4p jn (t+\n\u03b4p\nn\nkn n\nkn jn (tn\u22121 )\n=\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\u03b4p kn jn (t+\nn\u22121 )\n(B26)\n\u223c \u2212\n2\nwhere we used Eqs.

It should also be noted that the\nassumptions used to derive this dynamics breaks some\nconservation laws in the original dynamics, for example,\nPN\nthe quantity j=1 \u03b4p j (t) is conserved in the original dynamics (B3), (B7), (B8) and (B9) but this cannot be\nguaranteed exactly in the low density dynamics (B19),\n(B20) and (B21).\nNow we consider the Lyapunov vector \u03b4\u0393 corresponding to a positive Lyapunov exponent. The positivity of\nthe Lyapunov exponent means that the amplitude |\u03b4\u0393 |\nof Lyapunov vector diverges exponentially in time. The\ndynamics given by (B19), (B20), (B21), (B25), (B28)\nand (B29) shows that the divergence of |\u03b4\u0393 | must come\nfrom the Lyapunov vector components corresponding to\ncolliding particles, as the other Lyapunov vector components diverge at most linearly. For this reason we neglect the change of the Lyapunov vector components for\nnon-colliding particles. Under this assumption the Lyapunov vector dynamics for the Lyapunov vector component \u03b4\u0393 j \u2261 (\u03b4q j , \u03b4p j )T for the j-th particle is summarized as\n+\n[n\u22121]\n(B31)\n\u03b4\u0393 jn (t+\nn ) \u223c \u2212\u03b4\u0393 kn (tn ) \u223c \u03c4n \u03b4\u039e\n+\n+\n\u03b4\u0393 l (tn ) \u223c \u03b4\u0393 l (tn\u22121 ), for l \u2208\n/{jn , kn }, (B32)\n\n\f13\n\nwhere \u03b4\u039e[n\u22121] is defined by\n\u0012 [n]\n\u0013\n\u03a9 \u03b4p kn jn (t+\n[n\u22121]\nn\u22121 )\n\u03b4\u039e\n\u2261\n.\nQ[n] \u03b4p kn jn (t+\nn\u22121 )\n\n(B33)\n\nIt is essential to note that the Lyapunov vector compo+\nnents \u03b4\u0393 jn (t+\nn ) and \u03b4\u0393 kn (tn ) for the colliding particles\nhave the same amplitude, and \u03b4\u039e[n\u22121] is independent of\n\u03c4n .\nWe assume that the ratio\n\u03bc\u2261\n\n|\u03b4q j |\n|\u03b4p j |\n\n(B34)\n\nbetween the amplitudes of the spatial and momentum\nparts of the Lyapunov vector for the j-th particle, are independent of the particle index j [46].

Here \u03c1 is the particle density whose\nvalue is 0 < \u03c1 < 1, and \u03b4\u0393 j (0) is the Lyapunov vector component for the j-th particle at the initial time.\n\nWe choose the initial Lyapunov vector \u03b4\u0393 (0) so that its\ncomponents \u03b4\u0393 1 (0), \u03b4\u0393 2 (0), * * * , \u03b4\u0393 N \u22121 (0) and \u03b4\u0393 N (0)\nhave the same order of magnitude, and a larger clock\nvalue means larger magnitude of the Lyapunov vector\ncomponent, |\u03b4\u0393 j (tn )| .\nWe have already used the fact that the free flight time\nincreases as the density \u03c1 decreases. To write down the\nclock value more meaningfully, we use the specific relation between the free flight time and the density, namely\nthat the free-flight time \u03c4n M is approximately inversely\nproportional to the density \u03c1 at low density;\n\u03c4n \u223c sn /\u03c1\n\n(B41)\n\nwhere sn is independent of the density.

Our final assumption to derive\nthe clock model is that\nlim \u2206\u03a6[n] = 0.\n\n\u03c1\u21920\n\n(B44)\n\nTo justify the assumption (B44) note that the right-hand\nside of Eq.

From Eq. (B45), the dynamics for the\nclock model is expressed as (i) the clock value is changed\nonly when the corresponding particle collides, and (ii) the\nclock values of colliding particles are tuned to the same\nvalue given by 1 plus the larger of the two clock values\nof the particles just before the collision.\nIn the quasi-one-dimensional system with periodic\nboundary conditions, particle indices of the colliding particles can be taken so that kn = jn + 1 (note that index\nN + 1 is equivalent to 1). Therefore we obtain the dynamics (3) for the brick accumulation model explained\nin Sec. IV as the one-dimensional version of the clock\nmodel. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, Kj (n)\n\n\f14\n\ncan be interpreted as the brick height of the j-site just\nafter the n-th brick is dropped.\nFinally we derive the formula (5) for the largest Lyapunov exponent from the clock value Kj (n).

[28] suggests that the ratio \u03bc depends on the density \u03c1, and it can be \u03bc >> 1 for a Lyapunov vector\ncorresponding to a positive Lyapunov exponent at low\ndensity. Therefore the assumption (B44) is not obvious.\n[47] In the actual simulation of the brick accumulation model\nwe discarded the brick accumulations after the first\n100N bricks have been dropped. In this sense, the sum\n\nPN\n\nj=1 Kj (n) is not zero at n = 0. This is the reason why\nwe\nP Nadded the fitting parameter \u03b1 in the fitting function\nj=1 Kj (n) = \u03b1 + \u03b2n in Fig. 6 for consistency, although\nit is almost zero in this case.\n[48] More exactly, the distribution D(\u03c3 * \u2206p) for non-zero\nhopping cases in Fig. 10 was calculated as follows. First\nwe chose the case satisfying the conditions: (i) the parti(1)\ncle indices satisfying \u03b3j > 0.2 are given by {jn , jn + 1}\njust before the n-th collision and {jn+1 , jn+1 + 1} just\nafter the n-th collision, such that jn 6= jn+1 , and (ii)\nthe jn+1 -th particle and (jn+1 + 1)-th particle collide at\nthe n-th collision. (Here, if the particle indices for the\n(1)\nlocalized region of the Lyapunov vector satisfy \u03b3j > 0.2\nis {1, N }, then the particle indices pair {jn , jn + 1} or\n{jn+1 , jn+1 + 1} above should be taken as {0, 1}, based\non periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction of the quasi-one-dimensional system.) Under this\ncircumstance we calculate the distribution D(\u03c3 * \u2206p)\nfrom the value of \u03c3 * \u2206p in the n-th collision between\nthese jn+1 -th and (jn+1 + 1)-th particles.\n\n\fThis figure \"figA1qua1dim.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figB1hopRateN.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figC1brickModel.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figD1brickConfig.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figE1ndpdistri.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figX1loczAmpDynGradu.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figA2loczAmpDyn.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figC2hopRateBrick.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figD2brickDisNear.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figX2hopType.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figC3brickSum.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figX3hopRateDensi.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\fThis figure \"figC4LyapuMax.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/nlin/0506060v1\n\n\f"}
