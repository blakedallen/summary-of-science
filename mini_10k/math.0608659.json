Let f and g be reduced homogeneous polynomials in separate\nsets of variables. We establish a simple formula that relates the eigenspace\ndecomposition of the monodromy operator on the Milnor fiber cohomology of\nf g to that of f and g separately. We use a relation between local systems and\nMilnor fiber cohomology that has been established by D. Cohen and A. Suciu.\n\n1. Brief Introduction and Statement of Results\nThom-Sebastiani type Theorems have a rich history. This study was initiated\nby Sebastiani and Thom [12] and improved by others [8, 11]. Perhaps the most\nsuccessful generalization has been achieved by N\u00e9methi [5]. He considers the germs\nof three holomorphic functions f, g, p at the origin of Cn , Cm and C2 respectively,\nand then draws conclusions about the topology of the Milnor fiber [4] of p(f, g).\nN\u00e9methi discovered an expression for the Weil zeta function of p(f, g) in terms of\nthe monodromy representations of f and g as well as the several variable Alexander\npolynomial of p [6, 7].\nIn this paper we will investigate the case when f and g are homogeneous polynomials and p(x, y) = xy. We will construct a fibration different from those of\n[11, Theorem 2], and [5, 6, 8]. We will then produce a formula for the eigenspace\ndecomposition of the Picard-Lefschetz monodromy of f g in terms of those of f and\ng.\nThe following describes the situation we consider,\nHypothesis 1.1. Let f \u2208 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] and g \u2208 C[y1 , . . . , ym ] be homogeneous and\nreduced of positive degrees r and s respectively.\nIn this case the restriction f : Cn \\ {x | f (x) = 0} \u2192 C\u2217 defines a fibration. The\nfiber of this fibration is called the Milnor fiber of f , denoted Ff = f \u22121 (1) . Lifting\nthe path t 7\u2192 exp(2\u03c0it) : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 in C\u2217 induces, through a local trivialization\nof f , a diffeomorphism of the fiber. This map will be called a geometric PicardLefschetz(PL) monodromy of f . A geometric PL monodromy of f induces a map on\nthe cohomology algebra H \u2217 (Ff , C) which we will call the algebraic PL monodromy\nof f . In a more general setting we may have any smooth fibration F \u2192 M \u2192 N .\nGiven a loop in the base space N we may again construct a diffeomorphism of the\nfiber; in the case when this diffeomorphism is homotopic to the identity for any\nloop we choose, we say that the fibration has trivial geometric monodromy.\nFor any M \u2286 Ct \\ {0} we denote by M \u2217 the image of M under the Hopf fibration\n\u03c1 : Ct \\ {0} \u2192 Pt\u22121 .\nNote that as f is homogeneous, Ff\u2217 is the complement of the projective hypersurface defined by f = 0. Let f = f1 * * * fe be a factorization of f into irreducible\npolynomials. We note that (Cn \\ f \u22121 (0))\u2217 has first homology generated by the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDARREN SALVEN TAPP\n\nmeridian circles \u03b3i around fi\u22121 (0) \u2282 Pn\u22121 with orientations determined by the\ncomplex orientations. For \u03b7 r = 1 we denote by V\u03b7f the rank one local system on\n(C \\ f \u22121 (0))\u2217 = Ff\u2217 induced by the homomorphism\n(1.1)\n\n\u03a6f\u03b7 : H1 (Ff\u2217 ) \u2192 GL1 (C) = C\u2217\n\nthat sends H1 (\u03c1)(\u03b3i ) to \u03b7. We define W\u03b7 to be the local system on C\u2217 induced\nby the representation that sends the standard generator of \u03c01 (C\u2217 ) to \u03b7 \u2208 C\u2217 . We\nwill also let H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 denote the eigenspace of the algebraic PL monodromy of\nf with eigenvalue \u03b7. Lastly, the symbol # will be used as a subscript of a continuous function, and denotes the induced homomorphism defined on the fundamental\ngroups.\nWe will show the following two results:\nLemma 1.2. Let f and g be as in Hypothesis 1.1. Then there is a fibration Ff\u2217g \u2192\nFf\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 defined by\n[x1 : . . . : xn : y1 : . . . : ym ] 7\u2192 ([x1 : . . . : xn ], [y1 : . . . : ym ])\nwith fiber C\u2217 and trivial geometric monodromy.\nThe Leray spectral sequence associated to this fibration will allow us to prove\nthe following formula.\nTheorem 1.3. Let f and g satisfy Hypothesis 1.1. Then,\nH \u2217 (Ff g , C)\u03b7 = H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u2297 H \u2217 (Fg , C)\u03b7 \u2297 H \u2217 (C\u2217 , C).\nIn the statement above, the tensor symbol is used to mean the tensor product\nof vectorspaces graded by cohomological degree. Namely, if M\u2217 and N\u2217 are graded\nvectorspaces then\nM\n(M \u2297 N )k =\nM i \u2297 Nj .\ni+j=k\n\nIt clearly follows from Theorem 1.3 that the Weil zeta function of the algebraic\nPL monodromy of f g is always 1, recovering N\u00e9methi's result in our case [5].\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.3\nWe will make heavy use of a Theorem of D.Cohen and A. Suciu [1] that we state\nhere.\nTheorem 2.1 (Cohen, Suciu). Let f be homogeneous and reduced of degree r, and\npick \u03b7 \u2208 C\u2217 , \u03b7 r = 1. Then\nH \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u223c\n= H \u2217 (Ff\u2217 , V\u03b7f ).\n\u0003\nThe equation above simply tells us that an eigenspace of the algebraic PL monodromy of f is isomorphic to the cohomology of a local system defined on the complement of the projective hypersurface f = 0. This Theorem leads us to consider\nthe cohomology H \u2217 (Ff g , V\u03b7f g ). We establish Lemma 1.2 to aid in the computation\nof H \u2217 (Ff g , V\u03b7f g ).\n\n\fA RESULT ABOUT PICARD-LEFSCHETZ MONODROMY\n\n3\n\nLemma 2.2. Let Pn+m\u22121 have coordinates x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , ym . Let\nM = Pn+m\u22121 \\ (Pn\u22121 \u222a Pm\u22121 )\nbe the complement of the projective variety defined by the ideal\n(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) * (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ).\nThen the map\n\u03c6 : M \u2192 Pn\u22121 \u00d7 Pm\u22121\nsending [x1 : . . . : xn : y1 : . . . : ym ] to ([x1 : . . . : xn ], [y1 : . . . : ym ]) makes M a\nC\u2217 -bundle over Pn\u22121 \u00d7 Pm\u22121 with trivial geometric monodromy.\nProof. This map is clearly well-defined. When we restrict to the chart defined by\nxj 6= 0 (resp. yj 6= 0) then \u03c6 can be interpreted as the Hopf fibration applied to the\ny's (resp. x's). This map is clearly surjective and has trivial geometric monodromy\nas Pn\u22121 \u00d7 Pm\u22121 is simply connected.\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 1.2. The restriction of \u03c6 to Ff\u2217g has image Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 and has trivial\ngeometric monodromy.\n\u0003\nWhen we look at the Leray spectral sequence induced by this fibration we obtain\nthe following result.\nTheorem 2.3. If Hypothesis 1.1 holds then there is a spectral sequence\nE2i,j =\u21d2 H i+j (Ff g , C)\u03b7 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith E2i,j = 0 for j 6= 0, 1, and\ni,1\nE2i,0 \u223c\n=\n= E2 \u223c\n\nM\n\nH j (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u2297 H k (Fg , C)\u03b7 .\n\nj+k=i\n\nProof. Let M be the complement of f = 0 in Cn and f : M \u2192 C\u2217 be the Milnor\nfibration. On page 107 of [1] we have the following commutative diagram with exact\nrows.\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b9\n\n\u03c01 (C\u2217 )\n\n/ \u03c01 (M )\nf#\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u000f\nZ\n\n/ \u03c01 (M \u2217 )\n\n\u00d7r\n\n\u000f\n/Z\n\n\u000f\n/Z\n\nThe top row of this diagram is part of the homotopy sequence associated to the\nHopf fibration restricted to M . It also follows from [1] that if f = f1 * * * fe is a\nfactorization of f into distinct irreducible polynomials and if ai is the homotopy\nclass of a meridian around fi = 0 with orientation determined by the complex\norientations, then f# (ai ) = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , e. In this way H1 (M, Z) may\nbe identified with the free Z module with basis given by the homology classes\ndetermined by each of the ai , and f\u2217 : H1 (M, Z) \u2192 Z may be identified with\nthe matrix [1, 1, . . . , 1]T . Also note by commutativity that if \u03c3 is an appropriate\nchoice of a generator of \u03c01 (C\u2217 ), then we have f# \u25e6 \u03b9(\u03c3) = r. Thus in particular\n\u03a6f\u03b7 ([\u03b9(\u03c3)]) = \u03b7 r , where [\u2217] denotes \"the homology class determined by\".\nNow recall the fibration from Lemma 1.2:\n(2.3)\n\nC\u2217\n\n\u03ba\n\n/ Ff\u2217g\n\n\u03c6\n\n/ Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 .\n\n\f4\n\nDARREN SALVEN TAPP\n\nRecall further that we consider Ff\u2217 \u00d7Fg\u2217 as a subset of Pn\u22121 \u00d7Pm\u22121 with coordinates\nx1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , ym . The open subset y1 6= 0 of Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 can be thought of as\nM \u2217 \u00d7 C where C is the complement of the hypersurface g(1, y2 , . . . , ym ) = 0 in\nAm\u22121 . In this way, \u03c6\u22121 (M \u2217 \u00d7 C) is M \u00d7 C in Am+n\u22121 . In fact \u03c6|\u03c6\u22121 (Ff\u2217 \u00d7C) may\nbe identified with the Hopf fibration applied to the x's,\n(2.4)\n\n/ M\u2217 \u00d7 C .\n\n/ M \u00d7C\n\nC\u2217\n\nLet U \u2286 C be a contractible subset of C and \u03c8 = \u03c6|\u03c6\u22121 (Ff\u2217 \u00d7U) , and consider the\nrestriction of (2.4),\nC\u2217\n\n\u03bb\n\n/ M \u00d7U\n\n\u03c8\n\n/ M\u2217 \u00d7 U .\n\nThen by the discussion in the first paragraph of this proof we know that\n(2.5)\n\n\u03a6f\u03b7 g ([\u03bb# (\u03c3)]) = \u03b7 r ,\n\nwhere [\u2217] denotes the image of the homology class of \u2217 under the natural map\nH 1 (Ff\u2217 \u00d7 U, Z) \u2192 H 1 (Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 , Z).\nLet \u03b7 r+s = 1. We will see that the spectral sequence of the Theorem is essentially\nthe Leray spectral sequence\n(2.6)\n\nH i (Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 , Rj \u03c6\u2217 (V\u03b7f g )) =\u21d2 H i+j (Ff\u2217g , V\u03b7f g ).\n\nTo compute Rl \u03c6\u2217 (V\u03b7f g ), we may apply [2, Proposition 6.4.3] to obtain:\n\u2022 Rl \u03c8\u2217 (V\u03b7f g |Ff\u2217 \u00d7U ) = \u03c01\u2217 (V\u03b7f )|Ff\u2217 \u00d7U if \u03b7 r = 1 and l = 0, 1.\n\u2022 Rl \u03c8\u2217 (V\u03b7f g |Ff\u2217 \u00d7U ) = 0 otherwise.\nHere \u03c01 : Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 \u2192 Ff\u2217 , and \u03c02 : Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 \u2192 Fg\u2217 are the natural projections.\nNote that the equation (2.5) calculates what A. Dimca calls the total monodromy\noperator on [2, p. 210]. A symmetric argument holds with f replaced by g (note\nthat \u03b7 r = \u03b7 \u2212s as \u03b7 r+s = 1) and we may conclude:\n\u2022 Rl \u03c6\u2217 (V\u03b7f g ) = \u03c01\u2217 (V\u03b7f ) \u2297 \u03c02\u2217 (V\u03b7g ) := V\u03b7f \u22a0 V\u03b7g if \u03b7 r = 1 and l = 0, 1.\n\u2022 Rl \u03c6\u2217 (V\u03b7f g ) = 0 otherwise.\nTherefore, if \u03b7 r 6= 1, \u03b7 r+s = 1 the spectral sequence (2.6) is zero. Hence\nH (Ff g , C)\u03b7 = 0. In this case H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 is also zero and the Theorem is proved.\nWhen \u03b7 r = 1 we may now apply the K\u00fcnneth formula [2, Theorem 4.3.14] to obtain\nthat for j = 0, 1 one has\nM\nH l (Ff\u2217 \u00d7 Fg\u2217 , Rj \u03c6\u2217 V\u03b7f g ) =\nH i (Ff\u2217 , V\u03b7f ) \u2297 H k (Fg\u2217 , V\u03b7f ),\n\u2217\n\ni+k=l\n\nwhile the left hand side is zero for other j. These are exactly the E2l,j terms of the\nspectral sequence of our Theorem, and we know that it converges to H \u2217 (Ff\u2217g , V\u03b7f g ) \u223c\n=\nH \u2217 (Ff\u2217g , C)\u03b7 . This establishes the Theorem for \u03b7 r+s = 1.\nIt may be noted that when \u03b7 r+s 6= 1 then either \u03b7 r or \u03b7 s is not equal to one. If\nr\n\u03b7 6= 1 then H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 is zero as well as H \u2217 (Ff g , C)\u03b7 . If \u03b7 s 6= 1 then H \u2217 (Fg , C)\u03b7\nis zero as well as H(Ff g , C)\u03b7 and the Theorem follows in these cases.\n\u0003\nWe will now concern ourselves with computing H i (Ff g , C). We first consider a\nvariant of [8, Theorem 4] and [11, Theorem 2] in our homogeneous case. We tacitly\nuse the embedding Ff g \u2282 Cn \u00d7 Cm in the following statement.\n\n\fA RESULT ABOUT PICARD-LEFSCHETZ MONODROMY\n\n5\n\nLemma 2.4. The map fb : Ff g \u2192 C\u2217 defined by (x, y) 7\u2192 f (x) is a fibration with\nfiber Ff \u00d7 Fg . A geometric PL monodromy of this fibration is,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\u03c0i\n2\u03c0i\nx, exp \u2212\ny .\n(x, y) 7\u2192 exp\nr\ns\nProof. Since f and g are homogeneous we have f (exp( rt )x) = exp(t)f (x) and\ng(exp( st )y) = exp(t)g(y). We also note that if f (x)g(y) = 1 then f (x) = g(y)\u22121 .\nThese two properties prove the Lemma.\n\u0003\nWe have a direct consequence, included here for completeness.\nTheorem 2.5. Let f and g satisfy Hypothesis 1.1, then\n\uf8eb\nH l (Ff g , C) \u223c\n=\n\nl\nM\n\n\u03bb=l\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec M\n\uf8ec\nH i (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u2297 H j (Fg , C)\u03b7\u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u03b7 r+s =1\ni+j=\u03bb\n\nwhere the inner sum runs over all possible \u03b7.\nProof. The algebraic PL monodromy operator of fb is\n\nTf \u2297 Tg\u22121 : H \u2217 (Ff , C) \u2297 H \u2217 (Fg , C) \u2192 H \u2217 (Ff , C) \u2297 H \u2217 (Fg , C)\n\nwhere Tf , Tg are the algebraic PL monodromy operators of the respective fibers.\nSince Tf , Tg are of finite order, they are diagonalizable. We let {ai } (resp. {bj })\nbe a homogeneous basis of H \u2217 (Ff , C) (resp. H \u2217 (Fg , C)) that are eigenvectors of Tf\n(resp. Tg ), with eigenvalue \u03b1i (resp. \u03b2j ). In such a case {ai \u2297 bj } are a basis of\neigenvectors for Tf \u2297 Tg\u22121 with eigenvalue \u03b1i \u03b2j\u22121 . This shows that\nM\nW\u03b1i \u03b2 \u22121 .\nRl fb\u2217 (CFf g ) =\nj\n\n(\u03b1i ,\u03b2j )\ndeg(ai )+deg(bj )=l\n\nErgo, since non-constant rank one local systems on C\u2217 have no cohomology\nM\nH p (C\u2217 , Rl \u03c8\u2217 (CFf g )) =\nC\n\u03b1i \u03b2j\u22121 =1\n\ndeg(ai )+deg(bj )=l\n\nfor p = 0, 1, and the left hand side is zero for p 6= 0, 1.\nNow we may consider the Leray spectral sequence associated with the fibration\nof Lemma 2.4. Since the base of this fibration is C\u2217 , the spectral sequence has only\ntwo columns, and thus converges on the second page. This yields the Theorem. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Theorem 1.3 now\nLfollows from Theorems 2.3 and 2.5. To see\nthis we denote by \u0393l\u03b7 the vector space i+j=l H i (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u2297 H j (Fg , C)\u03b7 . Theorem\n2.3 shows the existence of the following exact sequence,\n\u0393l\u22122\n\u03b7\n\nd2\n\n/ \u0393l\u03b7\n\n/ H l (Ff g , C)\u03b7\n\n/ \u0393l\u22121\n\u03b7\n\nBy [1, Proposition 1.1], H l (Ff , C)\u03b7 \u223c\n= H l (Ff , C)\u03b7\u22121 . Hence\nH l (Ff g , C) \u223c\n=\n\nl\nM\n\nj=l\u22121\n\u03b7 r+s =1\n\n\u0393j\u03b7 ,\n\nd2\n\n/ \u0393l+1\n.\n\u03b7\n\n\f6\n\nDARREN SALVEN TAPP\n\nby Theorem 2.5, and so the second differential, d2 is zero.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. A Few Examples\nThe reader may wish to consult [10] for definitions of terms that involve hyperplane arrangements.\nExample 3.1. Let r = 4, s = 5, f = x1 x2 (x1 + x2 )(x1 + 2x2 ), g = y1 y2 (y1 + y2 )(y1 +\n2y2 )(y1 +3y2 ). Note that f and g define generic central line arrangements. The Weil\nzeta function of any generic hyperplane arrangement singularity is presented in [9].\nTo compute the Weil zeta function of any hyperplane arrangement singularity one\nmay use [4, Theorem 9.6], the formula \u03c7(Fh ) = deg(h)\u03c7(Fh\u2217 ), and the algorithm [10,\nTheorem 5.87(c)]. This method is practical for low dimensions and is simple for line\narrangements. Also the Weil zeta function of any generic hyperplane arrangement\nsingularity is presented in [9]. Since the Milnor fiber of f and g is connected we may\neasily write down tables expressing the eigenspace decomposition of the algebraic\n(PL) monodromy as follows. Note that we express exp(2\u03c0i/5) as \u03c9.\ndim(H j (Fg , C)\u03b7 )\ndim(H j (Ff , C)\u03b7 )\n\u03b7\\j 0 1\n\u03b7\\j 0 1\n1 1 4\n1 1 3\n\u03c9 0 3\ni\n0 2\n\u03c92 0 3\n\u22121 0 2\n\u03c93 0 3\n\u2212i 0 2\n\u03c94 0 3\nNow our Theorem 1.3 immediately yields the following table for dim(H j (Ff g , C)\u03b7 ):\n\u03b7\\j\n1\n\n0 1\n1 8\n\n2 3\n19 12\n\nwhere there is a zero for every other \u03b7 and j. In this example even though the\nalgebraic PL monodromy of f and g have non-unity eigenvalues the algebraic P L\nmonodromy of f g has one as the only eigenvalue.\nThis behavior is not uncommon. Theorem 1.3 guarantees that H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 will\nnot contribute to H \u2217 (Ff g , C) if H \u2217 (Fg , C)\u03b7 is zero. We state this observation as\nthe following Corollary of Theorem 1.3.\nCorollary 3.2. We assume the conditions of Hypothesis 1.1. H \u2217 (Ff g , C)\u03b7 6= 0 if\nand only if H \u2217 (Ff , C)\u03b7 6= 0 and H \u2217 (Fg , C)\u03b7 6= 0. In particular if H \u2217 (Ff g , C)\u03b7 6= 0\nthen \u03b7 gcd(r,s) = 1.\n\u0003\nHere we give an if and only if condition for the vanishing of H j (Ff g , C)\u03b7 . The\nsecond paragraph of remark 3.2 of [3] only provides the second sentence of this\nCorollary.\nExample 3.3. Let r = 3, s = 6, f = x31 +x32 +x33 and g = y1 y2 (y1 +y2 )(y1 +2y2 )(y1 +\n3y2 )(y1 + 4y2 ). The eigenspace decomposition of f is discussed in [4, section 9] and\ng is a line arrangement so we obtain\n\n\fA RESULT ABOUT PICARD-LEFSCHETZ MONODROMY\n\n7\n\ndim(H j (Fg , C)\u03b7 )\n\u03b7\\j 0 1\ndim(H j (Ff , C)\u03b7 )\n1 1 5\n\u03b7\\j 0 1 2\n\u03c9 0 4\n1 1 0 2\n\u03c92 0 4\n\u03c92 0 0 3\n\u03c93 0 4\n\u03c94 0 0 3\n\u03c94 0 4\n\u03c95 0 4\nwhere \u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/6).
