As shown in\nrecent years, the unprecedent control and precision provided by ultracold gases in optical lattices makes these\nsystems optimal candidates for such a technology. Furthermore, since the dynamical control over the optical\nlattice parameters permits the simultaneous coupling between nearest atom-lattice sites, these systems are also\nincreasingly used as quantum simulators to mimic distinct complex condensed matter Hamiltonians[1].\nThe controlled generation of double well lattices, i.e.\nlattices whose unit cells contains two sites, has opened\nthe possibility to isolate and address individually pairs\nof atoms, and hence to manipulate the interactions between them. Seminal results are the demonstration of\ncontrolled exchange interaction between pairs of neutral\natoms in an optical lattice when the atoms are forced\nto be in the same location [2], and the demonstration of\nsuperexchange interactions [3], showing that the interactions between atoms trapped in two adjacent sites of\nthe optical lattice can be made analogous to the interactions between atomic spins in magnetic materials. While\nRef. [2] sets a basis to perform in a controlled manner\ntwo qubit gates between neighboring atoms in the double well lattice, Ref. [3] opens a direct path towards the\nrealization of low-temperature quantum magnets and a\nvariety of many-body spin models with ultracold atoms.\nThe atomic interaction control achieved with optical\nlattices has also direct applications to quantum computation. A particularly well suited approach that exploits\nthe innate massive parallelism of such systems to perform quantum computation is the Measurement Based\nQuantum Computation (MBQC), where information is\n\nprocessed by means of a sequences of measurements on a\nhighly entangled initial state. It requires the capability\nto create universal cluster state, that is, a multipartite\nquantum state able to reproduce any entangled quantum\nstate in 2D, and to perform local single qubits operations. Using as qubits two internal states of atoms in a\n2D optical lattice, it is possible to create a highly entangled quantum state by means of controlled collisions[4],\nwhich is indeed a prerequisite for the generation of universal cluster state.\nAlthough neutral atoms couple weakly to the environment and they have relatively long coherence times compared with the time scale associated with the achievable\ncoupling strength, when atoms are brought to an entangled state decoherence will rapidly destroy any quantum\nsuperposition of atoms. The larger the entangled system\nis, the faster it will decohere. To fight against decoherence one should prepare the atoms in quantum states that\nare robust against external perturbations. For periodic\narrays of double-wells [5, 6, 7], resilient encoding schemes\nusing two internal states (two Zeeman levels) of the atoms\nhave been proposed. In these schemes, each double-well\ntraps two two-level particles to encode a logical qubit.\nThe logical space is spanned by the singlet and triplet\nstates of the two spin 1/2 particle along the quantization\naxis (here denoted by z) {|Si = \u221a12 (|\u2191i |\u2193i \u2212 |\u2193i |\u2191i) and\n|T0 i = \u221a12 (|\u2191i |\u2193i + |\u2193i |\u2191i)}. Since these states have a\nzero z-component of the total spin, such encoding is insensitive to fluctuations of the magnetic field along the\nquantization axis. In practice, such an encoding scheme\nis very well suited for robust controlled interactions along\none, lets say horizontal, direction. To create a universal\n2D cluster states (cluster states in 1D are not universal),\ninteractions and hence entanglement between neighboring atoms along both, the horizontal and the vertical\ndirections, should be performed in such a way that robustness is preserved. In the above encoding, interac-\n\n\f2\ntions along the vertical direction, will leave the subspace\nof zero spin component along the quantization axis, becoming very fragile in front of external magnetic field\nfluctuations noise. In this paper we show how this limitation can be overcome by using 2D optical superlattices.\nIn passing, let us point out that superimposing secondary optical lattices (or \"superlattices\") on top of the\nprimary ones to further modify the potential in which\nthe atoms are trapped permits in general to create polymerized lattices. By polymerized lattices we mean lattices consisting of weakly coupled groups of neighboring\natomic sites denoted as plaquettes. An example of a polymerized lattice is a square lattice made of smaller squares.\nThe intra-plaquette interactions in such lattices might be\nstrong and may even be designed to include many(> 2)body terms, while the inter-plaquette interactions might\nbe much weaker. Polymerized lattices allow for instance\nto engineer Valence Bond Solids on demand, to study\ntopological spin liquids and one might envisage them as\npotential quantum circuits. It is also very appealing to\ntry to use the plaquettes as qubits or qudits (elementary\nsystems with more than two internal states) for quantum\ninformation processing and implement quantum logical\ngates, quantum protocols, and quantum error correction\nin such systems by employing either interatomic interactions or/and interactions with external (electric, magnetic, laser) fields.\nHere we take advantage of the 2 dimensional superlattices to present new schemes to prepare universal 2D\ncluster states using the plaquettes as logical qubits. The\nsuperlattices creates a periodic array of plaquettes, i.e.,\n2 \u00d7 2 potential wells (as shown in Fig. 1), each of them\nfilled with an atom with two internal degrees of freedom\n(spin 1/2 particle). On each plaquette, we encode a single logical qubit using the two-fold singlet subspace of the\nfour 1/2-spins, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, by doubling\nthe physical resources in comparison with the 2 physical\nqubit encoding previously mentioned, we obtain the desired encoding that is decoherence free against uniform\nmagnetic field fluctuations in arbitrary directions.\nThe encoding scheme using the singlet subspace of four\nqubits has been previously studied for the quantum dot\nsystems, and it is also called the \"supercoherent qubit\"\n[8, 9, 10]. Also, it has been shown that in such a configuration, tunable Heisenberg superexchange interactions\n(between neighboring spins, including the diagonal and\noff diagonal ones) are sufficient for universal quantum\ncomputation [11, 12]. In the model we propose here, the\ngeneration of a universal cluster state demands: (i) the\nability to perform one qubit gates to prepare\nall logip\ncal qubits in the initial state |+i = 1/ (2)[|0i + |1i],\nand (ii) the realization of controlled-phase gates, U =\ndiag(1, 1, 1, \u22121), between nearest logical qubits, i.e. between plaquettes, to create a maximally entangled 2D\ncluster state. Notice that the superlattice geometry of\nFig. 1 does not induce interactions along the diagonals\nsites on each plaquette, and thus, the most challenging\ningredient for universality is, indeed, the two qubit (two\n\nplaquette) gate. In this article, we propose three different approaches to couple the logical qubits that either preserve the singlet subspace at the end of the gate\noperation or keep the state within the singlet subspace\neven during the whole completion of the gate. In all approaches, we take into account realistic available tools\nand discuss the practical limitations in optical superlattices. In our first approach, we exploit the additional\nvibrational mode of the optical trap to facilitate the logical coupling gate. In our second approach, we extend the\nearlier proposals [9, 10] by removing the requirement of\nequal coupling strengths for all six pairs within the plaquette (more feasible for 2D optical superlattices), while\nwe still obtain the effective Hamiltonian within the logical subspace sufficient for universal gates. In our last\napproach, we include tunable Ising-type interactions between neighboring spins (attainable with neutral atoms\nin optical lattices [13]) and use the optimal control techniques to find efficient and robust pulse sequences for the\nlogical coupling gate.\nWe notice that other proposals which exploit the superlattice structure in 2D to create a universal resource\n(which is different from the universal cluster state) for\nMBQC by connecting Bell entangled pairs by entangling\nphase gate have been proposed recently [7].\nThe paper is organized as follows: first, in Sec. II we\npresent the general ideas for generating cluster states\nwithin a decoherence free subspace (DFS) using optical superlattices. Then, in Sec. III we briefly review the\nsinglet DFS of the plaquette and describe operations of\nsingle logical qubit using superexchange couplings. Finally, in Sec. IV we consider the key challenge of implementing the logical controlled-phase gate with the singlet DFS encoding. We propose three new approaches\nfor the controlled-phase gate: the geometric phase approach, the perturbative approach, and the optimal control approach. A detailed comparison among the three\napproaches is summarized at the end of this section (Table I) before we present our conclusion in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nDECOHERENCE FREE CLUSTER STATES\n\nOne promising approach to quantum computation is\nthe measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC)\n[14, 15], which uses universal resources such as the cluster states. The cluster states can be efficiently prepared by initializing all lattice spins in the product state\nof |+i = \u221a12 (|0i + |1i) and performing the controlledphase gate between all pairs of neighboring spins. The\ncontrolled-phase gate induces an additional factor \u22121 if\nboth input qubits are in state |1i. Up to some individual\nqubit rotations, the controlled-phase gate can be achieved\nby Ising-type interaction between two input qubits.\nThe preparation of a cluster state has been demonstrated using optical lattices [4], with logical qubits directly stored in individual spins. Controlled-collisions\nare used to implement the controlled-phase gate between\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The optical superlattice consists of\na periodic array of 2 \u00d7 2 plaquettes. The 2D optical trapping potential is created by adding two superlattice potentials\nVx (x) and Vy (y) illustrated in the bottom and left panels.\nThe intra-plaquette coupling is represented by the solid lines\nand the inter-plaquette coupling is represented by the dashed\nlines.\n\nneighboring spins. However, such atomic qubits for the\ncontrolled-collision scheme are vulnerable to magnetic\nfield fluctuations, which limits the practical implementation of the MBQC.\nThe optical superlattice inducing a periodic array of\n2 \u00d7 2 plaquettes (as shown in Fig. 1) can be created by\nsuperimposing two optical lattice potentials with short\nand long wavelengths differing by a factor of two [16]\nalong both, x and y, directions. The effective optical\ntrapping potential becomes\nV = Vx (x) + Vy (y)\n(1)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2 \u03c0\nwhere Vu = Vu,s cos2 2\u03c0\n\u03bb u \u2212 \u03c6u,s + Vu,l cos\n\u03bb u \u2212 \u03c6u,l\nfor u = x, y. The short-lattice wavelength is \u03bb, and the\nparameters Vu,s , Vu,l , \u03c6u,s and \u03c6u,l are controlled by the\nintensities and phases of the laser beams.\nFor integer filling with one particle per site, each plaquette has four particles. The four spin-1/2 particles\nhave a two-fold singlet subspace with total spin zero along\nall directions (i.e., Stot = 0). Thus, the singlet subspace\nis the DFS insensitive to uniform magnetic field fluctuations.\nThe intra-plaquette couplings (solid lines in Fig. 1) enable operations of single logical qubit encoded in the plaquette. (Note that by manipulating intra-plaquette couplings minimum instances of topological matter can be\ndemonstrated in the same optical superlattice [17].) In\norder to create the decoherence free cluster states, we\nwill also need inter-plaquette couplings (dashed lines in\nFig. 1) to implement the controlled-phase gates.\nThere are eight sites for two neighboring plaquettes. If only four middle sites are involved for the\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Simultaneous coupling between neighboring plaquettes. (a) It is possible to simultaneously implement the controlled-phase gates between neighboring plaquettes along the horizontal direction, if only four sites are\ninvolved for each controlled-phase gate (e.g., for the geometric phase approach or the optimal control approach). (b) The\noptical superlattice (with inter-plaquette coupling and alternating energy off-set for odd and even plaquettes, created by\n\u03bb, 2\u03bb, 4\u03bb) can yield the inter-plaquette coupling for the geometric phase approach. (c) The spin-dependent optical superlattice (indicated by thin and thick lines of potential profiles)\ncan generate Ising interaction [13] useful for the optimal control approach.\n\ncontrolled-phase gate (e.g., for the geometric phase approach in section IV A or the optimal control approach\nin section IV C), it is possible to simultaneously apply\ncontrolled-phase gates to couple all horizontal (or vertical) neighboring plaquettes with no overlap of sites involved for different controlled-phase gates as shown in\nFig. 2. Meanwhile, if all eight sites from both plaquettes\nare involved for the controlled-phase gate (e.g., the perturbative approach in section IV B), two steps are needed\nto couple the plaquettes along the horizontal direction:\nfirst couple each even plaquette with the neighboring odd\nplaquette on the left, and then couple each even plaquette with the neighboring odd plaquette on the right.\nIn order to use the prepared cluster state for the\nMBQC, we should also be able to measure the individual qubits. This can be achieved by first converting the\nspin singlet/triplet states into different particle number\nconfigurations [2, 16], and then using various techniques\nof coherent optical control with subwavelength resolution\n[18, 19, 20] to projectively count the particle number at\na specific site (without compromising the coherence for\nthe remaining sites).\nIn the next two sections, we will consider the rotation\nof single logical qubit using intra-plaquette couplings,\nand the controlled-phase gate between two logical qubits\nusing the additional inter-plaquette couplings, respectively.\n\n\f4\nof total spin 0. We use the two-fold singlet subspace of\nthe plaquette to encode the logical qubit. The singlet\nsubspace is spanned by\n|\u03a8H i = |Si1,2 \u2297 |Si3,4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Intra-plaquette superexchange couplings. The coupling strengths are (a) JH = t2H /U between\nhorizontal neighbors and (b) JV = t2V /U between vertical\nneighbors. They can be changed independently by tuning the\nbarriers between the sites.\nIII.\n\nLOGICAL QUBIT ENCODED IN THE\nPLAQUETTE\n\nIn this section, we focus on the operations within the\nplaquette via intra-plaquette coupling. For concreteness,\nwe consider bosonic particles, and similar results can be\nobtained for fermionic particles as well. The following\nHubbard Hamiltonian governs the dynamics of a single\nplaquette, with spin-independent tunnelings and interactions (we will introduce an additional vibration level in\nSec.

The tunneling amplitudes (tH = t12 = t34 and tV = t23 = t41 )\nand the offset energies (\u03bci ) can be changed by tuning\nthe superlattice parameters. The large on-site interaction U \u001d tH , tV ensures that the system is in the Mott\ninsulator regime with fixed particle number for each site.\nParticle tunneling only occurs virtually between neighboring sites, which leads to the superexchange coupling\nHef f = \u2212JH (~s1 * ~s2 + ~s3 * ~s4 ) \u2212 JV (~s2 * ~s3 + ~s4 * ~s1 ) ,\n(3)\nwhere ~si are Pauli operators for the spin at site i.

Since h\u03a8H |\u03a8V i =\n1/2 6= 0, it is more convenient to use the orthogonal\n\u0001\nstates |0i \u2261 |\u03a8V i and |1i \u2261 \u221a23 12 |\u03a8V i \u2212 |\u03a8H i .

(b)\n\nAlternatively combined superexchange coupling (with contributions from both JH and JV ) can implement the rotation\naround the axis ~nC , which rotates the Bloch vector from ~nV\nto ~ng in one step.\n\nB.\n\nRotating logical qubit with super-exchange\ncoupling\n\nWe now consider arbitrary rotations in the singlet subspace using super-exchange couplings. First\nof all, the superexchange coupling Hamiltonian commutes with the total spin operator of the plaquette [Hef f , ~s1 + ~s2 + ~s3 + ~s4 ] = 0, due to the identity\n[~si * ~sj , ~si + ~sj ] = 0. Consequently, the superexchange\ncoupling preserves the singlet subspace (with zero total\nspin). Within the singlet subspace we have\n\nwith ~nH\n\n. 1 1\n~nH * ~\u03c3 = \u2212 (~s1 * ~s2 + ~s3 * ~s4 )\n(12)\n2 4\n. 1 1\n~nV * ~\u03c3 = \u2212 (~s2 * ~s3 + ~s4 * ~s1 )\n(13)\n2 4\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\nand ~nV = (0, 0, 1) as illustrated\n= 23 , 0, \u22121\n2\n\nin Fig. 4(a). The constant of 1/2 can be neglected, as it\nonly induces an overall phase during the evolution. The\nrotations about these axes can be controlled by switching\non/off the superexchange couplings of JH and JV , which\nvaries expentially with the height of the corresponding\nbarriers. Since the angle between ~nH and ~nV is 2\u03c0/3,\narbitrary rotation of the Bloch sphere can be achieved\nwithin 4 operations. (This is a special case of the general\ntheorem [21, 22] stating that k+2 operations are sufficient\nfor arbitrary rotation given the angle \u03b7 between the two\n\u03c0\nrotation axes satisfies \u03c0k > min (\u03b7, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7) \u2265 k+1\n.)\nThe product state of two vertical singlet pairs |0i =\n|\u03a8V i can be initialized using the procedure demonstrated\nin [3]. Universal rotation enables dynamical preparation\nof arbitrary logical state encoded in singlet subspace.\n\nWe now consider inter-plaquette couplings (dashed\nlines in Fig. 1). In particular, we focus on implementing the controlled-phase gate between two neighboring\nplaquettes, which induces an additional \u22121 phase if both\nencoded qubits are in the logical state |1i. In principle, the controlled-phase gate can be achieved by the\nIsing-type interaction between the logical qubits, but unfortunately such interaction is not immediately available\nfrom the lattice experiments, as the effective Ising term\n\u03c3z \u03c3z0 requires four-site interaction (~s2 * ~s3 ) (~s04 * ~s01 ) [see\nEqs. (10,11)]. However, since what we want is the specific unitary evolution rather than the interaction, it is\nactually more feasible to implement the unitary evolution\ndirectly.\nIn the following, we present three different approaches\nto implement the controlled-phase gate between two\nneighboring plaquettes. For concreteness, we only consider coupling two neighboring plaquettes along the horizontal direction, while all three approaches can also couple neighboring plaquettes along the vertical direction.\nA.\n\nGeometric phase approach\n\nThe first approach uses the vibration levels and the\ngeometric phase to achieve the controlled-phase gate between neighboring plaquettes [Fig. 5(a)]. The geometric\nphase is proportional the surface area enclosed by the\nevolution trajectory in the Bloch sphere (associated with\nthe two energy levels that are degenerate). For example,\nif a half of the Bloch sphere is enclosed, the system acquires a geometric phase \u03c0. We first consider the bosonic\nparticles. It takes three steps to achieve the controlledphase gate:\nStep 1. We lower the inter-plaquette barrier and adiabatically tilt the intra-plaquette potential along the vertical direction [Fig. 5(b)]. Each lower site will be occupied\nby one particle (or two particles) if the vertical pair of\nparticles is in the singlet (or triplet) state [Fig. 5(c)]. For\nexample, if the spins (2, 3) are in the singlet state (denoted as S2,3 ), the transfer of particle from site 2 to site\n3 is prevented by the symmetry requirement of bosonic\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Geometric phase approach to\ncontrolled-phase gate (Step 1). (a) The sites from two neighboring plaquettes are labeled. (b) The intra-plaquette trapping potential along the vertical direction is adiabatically\ntilted. This results in single (or double) occupancy at the\nlower site if the vertical pair of particles is in the singlet (or\ntriplet) state. (c) Particle number configurations are plotted\nfor four possible of spin states: S2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 , S2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 ,\nT2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 , and T2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 . (S and T indicate singlet and\ntriplet.)\n\nparticles, resulting in one particle in site 3 [see the upper two panels in Fig. 5(c)]. If the spins (2, 3) are in the\ntriplet subspace (denoted as T2,3 ), the particle from site 2\nis adiabatically transferred to site 3, leaving two particles\nin site 3 [see the lower two panels in Fig. 5(c)]. Similar\nspin-dependent transfer also happens to other sites, such\nas (10 , 40 ).\nStep 2. We quickly apply a defined bias to the interplaquette lattice potential and lower the inter-plaquette\nbarrier along the horizontal direction [Fig. 6(b)]. This\ninduces single particle resonant tunneling with rate t between the vibrational ground state at site 2 and the vibrational excited state at site 10 [33], if there is one particle\nat site 2 and zero particle at site 10 [see the highlighted\nupper right panel in Fig. 6(c)]. By waiting for time 2\u03c0/t,\nwe obtain the geometric phase \u03c0 from the resonant tunneling for S2,3 \u2297T10 ,40 . As detailed in Sec. IV, for all other\nthree cases (S2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 , T2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 , and T2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 )\nwe only obtain a trivial geometric phase 0 (or 2\u03c0).\nStep 3. We change the intra-plaquette potential to\nthe initial balanced position along the vertical direction\n(having one particle per site) and restore each plaquette\nto the logical subspace.\nA recent superlattice experiment uses the resonant\ntunneling and the blockade induced by on-site interaction to count the number of atoms [23]. This experiment\ndemonstrates that the presence or absence of resonant\ntunneling can be highly sensitive to the number of particles in the lattice sites. The geometric phase approach\ncan be regarded as an extension that uses the resonant\ntunneling to coherently imprint a geometric phase for a\nspecific particle number configuration (corresponding to\ncertain logical state).\nThe procedure for the fermionic particles is almost\nthe same as that for the bosonic particles, except for\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Geometric phase approach to\ncontrolled-phase gate (Step 2). (a) The sites from two neighboring plaquettes are labeled. (b) A defined bias (\u2206) of\nthe inter-plaquette potential is quickly applied and the interplaquette barrier is lowered to facilitate the resonant tunneling along the horizontal direction. (c) Resonant tunneling\n(between the vibrational ground level of the left site and the\nvibrational excited level of the right site) can occur for the\nfollowing two cases: 1) each of the left and right sites has\nexactly one particle, and the two particles are in the singlet\nstate (see the left panel), 2) the left site has one particle and\nthe right site has zero particle (see the highlighted upper right\npanel). All other configurations are off-resonant, with negligible tunneling. After time 2\u03c0/t, a geometric phase \u03c0 from\nthe resonant tunneling is obtained for S2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 (the highlighted upper right panel), while only a trivial geometric phase\n(0 or 2\u03c0) is obtain for the other three cases (S2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 ,\nT2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 , and T2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 ).\n\nthe following three differences. First, the bias of the\nenergy off-set needs to be \u2206 = \u03c9 + URab for fermionic\nparticles (whereas \u2206 = \u03c9 for bosonic particles), where\n\u03c9 is the vibrational excitation energy and URab is the\non-site interaction between ground and excited levels at\nthe right site (10 or 40 ). Second, the geometric phase \u03c0\nis obtained from the resonant tunneling associated the\nsubspace T2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 for fermionic particles (whereas\nit is associated with S2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 for bosonic particles).\nThird, the geometric phase is 0 for the remaining cases\nfor fermionic particles (whereas it might be either 0 or\n2\u03c0 for bosonic particles).\nIt is tempting to consider using \u2206 = \u03c9 for the fermionic\nparticles, as we might expect that by exchanging the roles\nof singlet and triplets, the fermionic particles could be\nmapped to bosonic particles. However, the roles of singlet\nand triplets are not exactly symmetric. For example,\nconsider the case with one particle per site after Step\n1. For bosonic particles, the system is in the subspace\nS2,3 \u2297 S10 ,40 that has finite projection to S2,10 \u2297 S3,40 and\nT2,10 \u2297 T3,40 (but not T2,10 \u2297 S3,40 or S2,10 \u2297 T3,40 ), which\nyields a trivial 0 or 2\u03c0 geometric phase. For fermionic\nparticles, the system is in the subspace T2,3 \u2297 T10 ,40 that\nhas finite projection to T2,10 \u2297 S3,40 and S2,10 \u2297 T3,40 , as\nwell as S2,10 \u2297 S3,40 and T2,10 \u2297 T3,40 , which thus may\nyields a non-trivial \u03c0 geometric phase.\nThe detailed calculation for both bosonic and fermionic\nparticles are presented in Appendix A.\n\n\f7\nB.\n\ns\n\nPerturbative approach\n\nThe second approach uses both the intra- and interplaquette couplings acting on the eight sites. The intraplaquette coupling induces an energy gap between the\nlogical states (i.e., singlet subspace) and other non-logical\nstates, while the inter-plaquette coupling acts as a perturbation that induces different phase shifts for different logical states. The inter-plaquette coupling can be\nefficiently achieved using super-exchange interaction between the inter-plaquette neighboring sites.\nThe key challenge is to obtain the intra-plaquette interaction, with finite Heisenberg interaction between the\nsites along the diagonal and off-diagonal directions. We\ncan overcome the challenge by using a different design of\nthe optical lattice.\n1.\n\nLattice Geometry and Energy levels\n\nWe want to obtain the Hamiltonian with intraplaquette interaction:\nHintra = J\n\nX\ni=1,2,3,4\n\n~si * ~si+1 + d\n\nX\n\n~si * ~si+2 ,\n\n(14)\n\ni=1,2\n\nwhere the exchange interaction J = \u00b1t2 /U (d = \u00b1t\u03032 /U )\nis induced by the tunneling between the nearest neighbors (next-nearest neighbors) with tunneling rate t (t\u0303).\nThe positive and negative signs are for fermions and\nbosons, respectively. To simplify the notation, we have\nidentified ~s5 with ~s1 . Such type of interaction can be\ncreated by a lattice potential of the form [see Fig. 7(a)]\n\nl\n\nwhere Vus (u) = V2 cos(2ku) \u2212 V2 cos(ku) are the typical double well superlattice formed by the superposition\nof two independent sinusoidal potentials which differ in\nperiodicity, a = \u03c0/k, 2\u03c0/k, by a factor of two [3] and\nV c (x, y) = \u2212V 02 (k(x \u2212 y)) cos2 (k(x + y)) is an additional\npotential that allows to control the diagonal couplings\nwithin the plaquettes. It can be constructed for example\nfrom a folded, retro-reflected beam with out-of-the-plane\npolarization [24]. By varying the depths of the short, V s\nand V l long lattices it is possible to control the intra and\ninter-plaquette coupling independently, and in particular\nto make the latter negligibly small and the plaquettes\nindependent.\nAs the intensity of the non-separable part of the potential is ramped up, a minima at the center of the plaquettes develops. If the strength of the latter is such that\nthe energies of bound states in this minima are larger\nthan the energies of the lowest vibrational states at the\nplaquette sites it is possible to tune the ratio t\u0303/t without populating the central site, which is required for the\nvalidity of Eq. (14). For example using the parameters\nV l = 60ER = 15Er , V s = 9Er and V 0 = 10Er , with\nER = ~2 k 2 /(8m) and Er = ~2 k 2 /(2m) the photon recoil energy of the long and short lattices respectively one\ncan achieve a parameter regime with t\u0303/t \u2248 0.5 with an\nenergy gap to the first vibrational state in the central\nwell of order Eg /t \u2248 10. It is very difficult to increase\nt\u0303/t close to one by just controlling the lattice potential,\nbecause the energy gap disappears and the central sites\nbecome accessible. Therefore, we will focus on the case\nd < J.\nThe eigenstates associated with Eq. (14) can be classified according with their total spin S. As shown in\nFig. 7(b), there are two singlet (S = 0) states\n1\n|\u0003i = \u221a (|\u03a8H i + |\u03a8V i)\n3\n|\u00d7i = |\u03a8H i \u2212 |\u03a8V i,\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) (a) Density plot of the lattice potential\n[see Eq. (15)], which generates an array of 2 \u00d7 2 plaquettes in\nthe x \u2212 y plane with periodicity of 2\u03c0/k. Using parameters\nV l = 60ER , V s = 9Er and V 0 = 10Er , with ER and Er photon recoil energy of the long and short lattices respectively,\none can achieve a parameter regime with d/J \u2248 0.2. (b) Energy levels of a single plaquette described by the Hamiltonian\ngiven in Eq. (14). In the plot we assume fermionic atoms,i.e.\nJ, d > 0 (fermions). For bosons J, d < 0 the order of the energy levels is reverse i.e the S = 2 is the lowest energy state.\n\nV (x, y, z) = V c (x, y) + Vxs (x) + Vys (y),\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nwith energies E(|\u0003i) = \u22124(J \u2212 d) and E(|\u00d7i) = +4(J \u2212\nd), respectively. There are three S = 1 states denoted\nby |1(\u22121,0,1) i, with energies E(1(q) ) = 4J, 4J and 4d, respectively. For fermionic (bosonic) atoms the highest\n(lowest) energy state is a S = 2 state, |2i with energy\nE(2) = 4(2J + d).\nWe want to use the singlet states within each plaquette as encoded qubits and perform a phase gate between them by coupling nearest neighbor plaquettes into\na \"superplaquette\" (i.e., 2 \u00d7 4 potential wells). A superplaquette can be achieve by superimposing laser beams\nwith periodicities 4\u03bb and 4\u03bb/3 along one axis [25]. Such\nwavelength are experimentally available for typical Alkali\natoms or can be engineered by intersecting pairs of laser\nbeams at appropriated angles [26]. The 4\u03bb isolates pairs\nof adjacent plaquettes along one direction and the extra\n4\u03bb/3 lattice is needed to balance the offset created when\nthe latter lattice is added. When pairs of plaquettes are\nweakly coupled into a superplaquette the Hamiltonian\n\n\f8\nthat connects the plaquettes is given by\nHc = J 0 (~s2 * ~s10 + ~s3 * ~s40 ).\n\n(18)\n\nWe want to use the coupling to implement a controlledphase gate between the singlet eigenstates in the\ntwo plaquettes.\nTo achieve that we require that\nthe inter-plaquette coupling is weak (i.e., J 0 \u001c\nmin{4d, 8 (J \u2212 d) , 4(J \u2212 2d)}) and derive an effective\nHamiltonian by adiabatically eliminating the all S > 0\nstates.\nIn the following we discuss the implementation of\nthe controlled-phase gate for the experimentally relevant\nregime d < J. (The ideal case of d = J is discussed in\nAppendix B.)\n\n2.\n\nPerturbative approach with d < J\n\nFor the 2D plaquette implementation the diagonal coupling d is always smaller than J and therefore the singlet\nstates within the plaquette are non-degenerate\n|\u2206E| = |E(|\u00d7i) \u2212 E(|\u0003i)| = 8|J \u2212 d| > 0.\n\n(19)\n\nRegardless of this issue, it is still possible to derive an\neffective Hamiltonian provided that the inter-plaquette\ncoupling J 0 is less than the energy difference between\n|\u00d7i and all other states [see Fig. 7(b)]:\n0\n\nJ \u001c min{4d, 8 (J \u2212 d) , 4(J \u2212 2d)}.\n\n(20)\n\nFrom this consideration we observe that close to d =\n0, J/2 and J, the perturbative approach (based on |\u0003i\nand |\u00d7i) breaks down and we should stay away from\nthese points.\nAs detailed in Appendix B, we can obtain the effective\nHamiltonian\n\nef f\nHi,i+1\n=(\n\n0\nJ 2 \u03b3z X z\n\u2206E\n\u2212\n)\n\u03c3\u0302j\n2\nJ\nj=i,i+1\n\n(21)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0\nJ 2 1\u02c6 \u02c6\n1 z z\n\u2212\n~\u03c3i * ~\u03c3i+1 + (\u03bbz \u2212 )\u03c3\u0302i \u03c3\u0302i+1 ,\nJ 8\n8\nwhere \u03c3\u0302 are effective Pauli matrices acting on the |\u0003i, |\u00d7i\nstates, and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 9J\n8J\n24J\nJ\n\u03bbz =\n\u2212\n+2\u2212\n+\n(22)\n48 d\nd \u2212 3J\nd+J\n2J \u2212 d\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 9J\n8J\nJ\n\u03b3z =\n+\n\u22128\u2212\n.\n(23)\n48 d\nd \u2212 3J\n2J \u2212 d\nIn Fig. 8(a) the parameters \u03bbz and \u03b3z are plotted as a\nfunction of d/J.\n\u02c6i * ~\u03c3\n\u02c6i+1 commutes\nWithin a superplaquette the term ~\u03c3\n02\n\nef f\nJ\nwith Hi,i+1\n(it only introduces a phase \u03c6T = ~J8\ntc in the\neffective triplet subspace: |\u0003, \u0003i ,|\u00d7, \u00d7i and (|\u0003, \u00d7i +\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) (a) Parameters of the effective Hamiltonian for the general case d 6= J.

There\nare 4 critical points at which the fidelity drops considerably,\nthese are d/J \u2248 0, 0.5, 0.62, 1. At d/J \u2248 0 and 0.5, one of\nthe singlet states becomes degenerate with one S = 1 state\nand consequently the effective Hamiltonian breaks down. At\nthe d/J \u2248 0.62 the Ising term vanishes and at d = J the\nrotating wave approximation used in the simplification of the\neffective Hamiltonian becomes invalid. The shadow regions\nare the ones where the achievable fidelity is higher than 0.98.\n02\n\u221a\n|\u00d7, \u0003i)/ 2 and \u03c6S = \u2212 3J\ntc for the effective singlet\n~J8\n\u221a\nstates: (|\u0003, \u00d7i \u2212 |\u00d7, \u0003i)/ 2).

Consequently\nef f\nHi,i+1\ncan be used to perform a controlled-phase gate\nwithin a superplaquette. We use the standard echo technique (i.e., \u03c0 pulses at tc /2 and tc for each of the encoded\nqubits) to remove the unwanted \u03c3\u0302jz term from the effective Hamiltonian in Eq. (21). The controlled-phase gate\ncan be achieved by the unitary evolution\nU = X e\u2212i(Hintra +Hc )tc /2 X e\u2212i(Hintra +Hc )tc /2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere X represents the echo \u03c0 pules for the encoded\nqubits, which can be achieved via intra-plaquette superexchange couplings.\n\n\f9\nentanglement generation not all d/J values are allowed\nbut only the ones which satisfy the following conditions:\n\u03c6T \u2212 \u03c6S = 2\u03c0m\n\n(26)\n\n0\n\nJ2\n1\n\u03c0\ntc (\u03bbz \u2212 ) = ~(2n \u2212 1) ,\nJ\n8\n4\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) For the d < J, the cluster state generation has to be applied in two steps (a) and (b).\n\nWe use the exact diagonalization to calculate the\n2\ncontrolled-phase gate fidelity F = |f | with\nf=\n\nh\ni\n1\n\u2020\nTr Uc\u2212phase\nP U P ,\nN\n\n(25)\n\nwhere P is the projection operator to the singlet subspace\nfor each plaquette. In Fig. 8(b), we plot F as a function of\nd/J for different rations of J 0 /J, with n = 1. The Figure\nshows that at the points d \u2248 0.5J, d \u2248 0.62J, d = 0,\nd = J there is an abrupt drop of the fidelity, as the ratio\nJ 0 /J is increased. The drop at these points is expected\nsince at d \u2248 0.5J and d \u2248 0 one of the singlet states\nbecomes degenerate with one S = 1 and consequently\nthe effective Hamiltonian breaks down. At d \u2248 0.62J\n, \u03bbz = 1/8 [see Fig. 8(a)] the Ising term vanishes and\nat d = J the two singlets become degenerate and the\nrotating wave approximation (assumed for the derivation\nof the effective hamiltonian in Appendix B) is not longer\njustified.\nAway from these points the derived effective Hamiltonian provides a good description of the dynamics and\nfor values of J 0 \u2248 0.1J one can get a gate fidelity above\n0.98. In the plot we highlight with a gray shadow the\nd/J parameter regime where the achievable fidelity is\nabove 0.98. However among these shadow regions only\nthe regime d/J < 0.5 is experimentally achievable using the lattice geometry described early in this section.\nThe small fluctuations in the fidelity curves are due to\nthe non-energy preserving terms neglected to obtain the\neffective hamiltonian (see\np Appendix B), which can be\nsuppressed when J 0 \u001c 8 (J \u2212 d) J.\n\u02c6i * ~\u03c3\n\u02c6i+1 , on the other hand, does\nThe Heisenberg term ~\u03c3\nef f\nnot commute with Hi+1,i+2 and consequently the phase\ngate can not be applied simultaneously to all plaquettes.\nInstead it has to be applied first between the superplaquettes formed by the plaquettes 2i + 1, 2i + 2 and subsequently between the superplaquettes formed from plaquettes 2i + 2, 2i + 3 (see Fig. 9). Additionally in order\nto create a cluster state across all the plaquette array, it\nis required to fine tune the parameters and time evolution to eliminate the different phase accumulated by the\ntriplet and singlet states in the encoded spin basis due to\nthe Heisenberg term at tc . Consequently for multipartite\n\n(27)\n\nwhere n and m are integers. In Fig. 10(a), we show a\nset of allowed d/J values which satisfy the conditions\ngiven by Eq. (26), for different n and m values. Here\nwe also highlight with a gray shadow the corresponding d/J values which yield a fidelity higher than 0.98 for\nJ 0 /J < 0.1. In Fig. 10(b) we show two examples of traces\nof the phase gate fidelity vs J 0 /J:(n, m) = (1, 1), (3, 4)\n(indicated in panel a. by a square) computed by exact\ndiagonalization of the superplaquette Hamiltonian. The\nfigure shows that it is always possible to find parameters\nwhich allow for a high gate fidelity. However, here we\nare only including errors due to higher order terms neglected in the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian. In\nrealistic experiments other external errors such as lattice\ninhomogeneities are always present, which can be minimized at the expense of a larger J 0 /J ratio (faster evolution). There is consequently a trade off between faster\ntime evolution and small perturbative corrections.\nIn conclusion we have presented a scheme to perform\ncontrolled-phase gates in the encoded singlet subspace.\nThis perturbative scheme has two advantages: (1) the\nplaquettes are always in the decoherence free subspace,\n(2) it is easy to implement as it only relays on the coherent dynamical evolution without further manipulations.\nDue to the fact that the dynamics is determined by a\nsecond order effective Hamiltonian the achievable fidelity\nwith the proposed schemes can become very high but at\nthe cost of slower time evolution. If the strongly interacting regime is reached by using a Feshbach resonance, one\ncan achieve values of J of order of 100 Hz and therefore\ncluster generation times of order 0.1\u22121 sec. These generation times are slow but longer than the encoded qubits\ndecoherence time due to their insensitivity against environmental decoherence [3].\n\nC.\n\nOptimal control approach\n\nWe now consider the optimal control approach to fast,\nhigh fidelity implementation of the controlled-phase gate\n[between the horizontal neighboring plaquettes (1, 2, 3, 4)\nand (10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ) as shown in Fig. 5(a)]. The key challenge here is to identify an efficient set of operators that\n(i) enable the unitary evolution of the controlled-phase\ngate, and (ii) are feasible using optical superlattices as\nwell. We first provide a set of operators sufficient to\nachieve the controlled-phase gate with arbitrary precision. After that we numerically find the pulse sequences\nfor these operators to implement the controlled-phase\ngate.\n\n\f10\nfor the set of operators\nO1 = ~s2 * ~s3\nO2 = ~s01 * ~s04\nO3 = s2,z s01,z + s3,z s04,z\n\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n\nO4 = s2,x + s3,x + s01,x + s04,x\nO5 = s2,y + s3,y +\n\ns01,y\n\n+\n\n(32)\n\ns04,y .\n\n(33)\n\nTo justify that H (t) can implement the controlledphase gate\ni\nh \u03c0\n(34)\nUc-phase = exp \u2212i (1 \u2212 \u03c3z ) (1 \u2212 \u03c3z0 ) ,\n4\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) Examples of controlled-phase gate\nwith perturbative approach. (a) The values of d/J that satisfy the conditions stated in Eqs. (26). The shadow regions highlight the regime where the phase gate fidelity can\nbe larger than 0.98 for J 0 /J < 0.1. (b) The controlled-phase\ngate fidelity F as a function of J 0 /J can be calculated by exact numerical diagonalization. The red dashed (or blue solid)\ncurve is for (n, m) = (1, 1) (or (3, 4)), which is also indicated\nby the red (blue) square in panel (a).\n\n1.\n\nChoice of operators\n\nIn principle, tunable Heisenberg superexchange interactions are sufficient for the controlled-phase gate by coupling all eight sites [11]. However, for the optical lattice experiments, we would like to achieve the controlledphase gate by coupling as few sites as possible, preferably\nusing global rotations for all spins and Heisenberg/Ising\ninteractions between neighboring sites [3, 13].\nAccording to Eqs. (10,11), we need at least two sites\nfrom each plaquette to determine the \u03c3z operator. Since\nthe controlled-phase gate depends on both \u03c3z operators\nfrom the plaquettes, we should consider at least four sites\nto implement the controlled-phase gate. It turns out that\ncoupling the four middle sites (2, 3, 40 , 10 ) is sufficient to\nachieve the controlled-phase gate, which significantly reduces the complexity compared with the earlier proposal\nthat couples all eight sites [11].\nWe consider the Hamiltonian\n\nwe show that (1 \u2212 \u03c3z ) (1 \u2212 \u03c3z0 ) belongs to the Lie algebra generated by {Ok }k=1,*** ,5 . We start with these five\noperators as the available set (AS), and calculate the\ncommutators among the AS operators. We then expand\nthe AS by adding new commutators that are not linear combinations of the AS operators. We denote the\nnumber of linearly independent AS operators as the dimension of the AS. We repeat the process of calculating\nthe commutators and expanding the AS, until its dimension does not increase any more. We use Mathematica\nto iterate the process of expanding the AS until it saturates at dimension 80 (including the identity operator\nthat commutes with all other operators). Finally, we\nverify that (1 \u2212 \u03c3z ) (1 \u2212 \u03c3z0 ) \u223c (~s2 * ~s3 ) (~s01 * ~s04 ) is a linear combination of the AS operators. Therefore, according to the local properties from the Lie algebra the set\nof operators {Ok }k=1,*** ,5 is sufficient to implement the\ncontrolled-phase gate. The remaining task is to find the\nsolution for {\u03b1k (t)}.\n\n2.\n\nSmooth pulses\n\nWe use an algorithm which can be interpreted as a continuous version of the gradient ascent pulse engineering\n(GRAPE) [27, 28], though it is developed in an independent way [29]. The algorithm based on optimal quantum\ncontrol is summarized in Appendix C. Comparing with\nthe GRAPE method it has the advantage that we can find\nsolutions with specific boundary conditions (e.g. pulses\nstart and end at zero) and in terms of smooth (finite\nslope) functions of time as well.\nMore specifically, the particular form of the coefficients\n{\u03b1k (t)} are chosen to be finite sums of sinusoidal functions\n\u03b1k (t, xk1 , . . . , xkL ) =\n\nL\nX\nl=1\n\nH (t) =\n\n5\nX\n\n\u03b1k (t) Ok ,\n\n(28)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere {\u03b1k (t)} are the time-dependent control variables\n\n\u0012\nxkl sin\n\nl\u03c0t\nT\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(35)\n\neach of which depends on L parameters {xkl } (l =\n1, . . . , L). As mentioned before, note that they fulfill\nthe convenient property that \u03b1k (0) = \u03b1k (T ) = 0 and\nthat they have a finite slope. Hence, we need to optimize\n\n\f11\nGeometric Phase\nPerturbative\nOptimal Control\nApproach\nApproach\nApproach\nTime scale for controlled-Z (CZ) gate\n1/J\nJ/J 02\n1/J\nDuration out of DFS\n1/t\n0\n1/J\n2\n2\n0\nSystematic errors\n(t/U )\n(J /J)\n0\n2\n(\u03b4t/t)2 , (\u03b4\u2206/t)2\n(\u03b4J/J)2 , (\u03b4J 0 /J 0 )\n(\u03b4J/J)2\nInhomogeneity errors\nSites per CZ gate\n4\n8\n4\nSimultaneous coupling\nYes\nTwo steps\nYes\nSuperexchange\nSuperexchange\nMajor interactions\nSuperexchange\nSingle particle tunneling\nIsing interaction\nSuperlattice wavelengths\n\u03bb, 2\u03bb, 4\u03bb\n\u03bb, 2\u03bb, 4\u03bb, 4\u03bb/3\n\u03bb, 2\u03bb\nVibrational levels\nGround + excited\nGround\nGround\nPhysical process\nClear\nClear\nHard to interpret\nControl complexity\nMedium\nLow\nHigh\nTABLE I: Comparison among three approaches.

In Fig. 11(b)\n\nwe plot the infidelity \u03b5 as a function of the relative deviation \u03b4J/J. We assume that the couplings in Eq. (28) are\ndeviated from \u03b1k to (1 \u2212 \u03b4J/J) \u03b1k ; that is the system\nevolves under the deviated Hamiltonian (1 \u2212 \u03b4J/J)H.\nFor simplicity, we consider the case that \u03b4J/J is timeindependent. (For example, imperfect calibration of barrier height or barrier thickness may induce such proportional, time-independent deviation in superexchange\ncouplings.) We find that the infidelity remains a constant value (approximately 10\u22127 ) for very small deviations (with \u03b4J/J < 10\u22124 ), while the infidelity scales\n2\nas (\u03b4J/J) for larger deviations (with \u03b4J/J > 10\u22123 )\nwhich is also plotted using the linear scale in Fig. 11(c).\nSuch quadratic dependence to the deviation is not uncommon, as the infidelity for single spin rotations also\nscales quadratically with the deviation. The quadratic\ndependence can be regarded as a direct consequence of\nthe optimization procedure, which finds a local minimum\nof the function with first order derivatives being zero.\n\n3.\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) (a) Smooth pulses with L = 20 yielding to infidelities smaller than 10\u22127 .

(c) Quadratic dependence\nof the fidelity with \u03b4J/J.\n\nExperimental implementation\n\nWe now briefly discuss the implementation of operators {Ok }k=1,*** ,5 (and {Ok }) for the cluster state preparation. The operators of O1 and O2 can be achieved by\nsuper-exchange interaction using superlattice techniques\n[3], while the operator of O3 can be obtained from spindependent tunneling in optical lattices [13]. Furthermore, we note that the evolution of the Ising interactions O3 between all horizontal neighboring plaquettes\ncan be performed simultaneously, because they act on\ndifferent groups of physical spins as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nFor the same reason, the operators of O4 and O5 can\nbe performed simultaneously for all spins by driving the\nentire optical lattice with appropriate micro-wave pulses\n[4]. Therefore, the simultaneous controlled-phase gates\nbetween all horizontally neighboring plaquettes can be\n\n\f12\nachieved.\n\nV.\n\nD.\n\nComparing three approaches\n\nWe compare the three approaches (see Table I) in the\nfollowing aspects: (1) two relevant time scales: the time\nto implement the controlled-phase gate, and the duration\nfor the plaquette not being protected by the DFS (which\nshould be short compared to the coherence time outside\nthe DFS [34]), (2) two types of errors contributing to\nthe controlled-Z (CZ) gate infidelity: the systematic errors from the approximations used in our analysis, and\nthe inhomogeneity errors due to the fact that the couplings (e.g., t, \u2206, J, and J 0 ) are not exactly the same\nfor all plaquettes, (3) the number of sites involved for\neach controlled-phase gate: if each gate only couples 4\nsites, the controlled-phase gates between all horizontal\n(or vertical) neighbors can be achieved simultaneously;\notherwise two sequential steps are needed, (4) the major interactions, such as singlet particle tunneling [16],\n(Heisenberg) superexchange coupling [3], and Ising interaction [13], (5) the wavelength components needed to\nconstruct the superlattices, (6) the relevant vibrational\nlevels, (7) the interpretation of the physical process, and\n(8) the control complexity for time-dependent parameters.\nThe maximum achievable fidelity for the CZ gate\nis limited by the systematic and inhomogeneity errors.\nFor the geometric phase approach, the systematic error\n2\n(t/U ) is due to the off-resonant tunneling, which is analyzed in Table II and Table III for bosonic and fermonic\nparticles, respectively; such off-resonant tunneling can be\nsuppressed by using Feshbach resonances to increase U\nwhile keeping the same tunneling rate t. For the perturbative approach, the controlled-phase gate fidelity is\nF > 0.98 for J 0 /J < 0.1 (Fig. 10). For the optimal control approach, the systematic error is only limited by the\nprecision of the numerics [Fig. 11(b,c)]. We note that it\nis important to suppress the inhomogeneity errors, as all\nthree approaches are sensitive to such imperfections. Replacing the parabolic trap with the flat-bottom trap [30]\ncan be one possible solution to reduce the inhomogeneity errors. It would also be interesting to consider other\napproaches that are insensitive to the inhomogeneity errors.\nOverall, the geometric phase approach has the advantage of fast operational time, short unprotected duration,\nand compatibility of simultaneous coupling. The perturbative approach has the advantage of always being\nprotected by the DFS and favorable control complexity.\nThe optimal control approach has the advantage of fast\noperational time, vanishing systematic errors, and compatibility of simultaneous coupling.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have discussed preparation of large\ncluster states for neutral atoms in optical superlattices.\nEach logical qubit is encoded in the decoherence-free singlet subspace of four spins from the 2 \u00d7 2 plaquette, so\nthat it is insensitive to uniform magnetic field fluctuations along an arbitrary direction. Besides arbitrary rotations of single logical qubit achieved by superexchange\ninteraction, we provide three different approaches to couple the logical qubits from neighboring plaquettes, with\ntheir properties summarized in Table I. These approaches\nmay also be applied to other quantum systems, such as\nquantum dots or Josephson junction arrays.\nWe would thank Hans Briegel, Ignacio Cirac, Eugene\nDemler, Wolfgang D\u00fcr, G\u00e9za Giedke, Vladimir Gritsev,\nand Bel\u00e9n Paredes for stimulating discussions.

First, the bias of the energy\noff-set needs to be \u2206 = \u03c9 + URab for fermionic particles\n(whereas \u2206 = \u03c9 for bosonic particles).

Third, the geometric phase is 0 for the remaining\ncases for fermionic particles (whereas it might be either\n0 or 2\u03c0 for bosonic particles).\nFor fermionic particles, the on-site interaction Hamiltonian for site i that governs both the ground and excited\nvibrational levels (a and b) is\nHi = \u03bci ni + \u03c9i nbi + Uiaa nai,\u2191 nai,\u2193 + Uibb nbi,\u2191 nbi,\u2193\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX \u2020 \u2020\n+ Uiab \uf8ednai nbi \u2212\nai,\u03c3 bi,\u03c30 bi,\u03c3 ai,\u03c30 \uf8f8 ,\n\n(A17)\n\n\u03c3,\u03c3 0\n\nwhere we have safely neglected the energy non-conserving\nP\nterms \u03c3,\u03c30 b\u2020i,\u03c3 b\u2020i,\u03c30 ai,\u03c3 ai,\u03c30 for \u03c9i \u001d Uiab .\nFor the biased potential between the two horizontal\nsites (L and R) as shown in Fig. 12, we have\nHL = \u2206 nL + ULaa nL,\u2191 nL,\u2193 ,\n\n(A18)\n\nHR = \u03c9nbR + URaa naR,\u2191 naR,\u2193 + URbb nbR,\u2191 nbR,\u2193\n+ URab\n\nnaR nbR \u2212\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\nnaR,\u03c3 nbR,\u03c3 \u2212\n\nX\n\n(A19)\n!\n\na\u2020\u03c3 a\u03c3\u0304 b\u2020\u03c3\u0304 b\u03c3\n\n,\n\n\u03c3\n\n(A22)\n\nfor the spin dependent interaction.

In Table III, we list\nthe energy difference associated with fermionic particle\ntunneling for various particle number configurations.\nHere are some remarks on the geometric phase approach. It is crucial to have large and sufficiently different on-site interactions compared with the tunneling\nrate t, because the virtual tunneling process may induce\n2\nhigher order systematic errors \u223c (t/U ) in the accumulated phase. One may use Feshbach resonances to enhance the on-site interaction and suppress such errors. In\naddition, the tunneling rate t and the energy difference\n\u2206 should be as homogeneous as possible, since inhomogeneities \u03b4t and \u03b4\u2206 may induce leakage errors out of the\n\u00012\n\u00012\nand \u03b4\u2206\n, relogical subspace with probability \u223c \u03b4tt\nt\nspectively.

Since they are degenerate we can choose any linear combinations of them\nas a basis. For convenience we choose the states |0i and\n|1i as our basis. These two states can be regarded as the\ntwo components of an effective pseudo-spin 1/2 system.\nIn the absence of any coupling the singlet subspace\nof the chain is spanned by product states of the effective pseudo-spin states |0i, |1i at the plaquettes and all\nfour possible configurations are degenerate. A finite J 0\nbreaks the degeneracy. Since the Hc Hamiltonian does\nnot directly couple the effective pseudo spins, they get\nonly coupled through second order virtual processes to\nintermediate high energy states with S > 0.
