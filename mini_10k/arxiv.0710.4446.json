Cardona1,*, R.V. Chamberlin2, and W. Marx1\n1\n2\n\nMax Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstr. 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany\nDepartment of Physics, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1504, USA\n\n* Corresponding author E-mail: m.cardona@fkf.mpg.de\n\nThe current citations of 19th century papers have recently received considerable\nattention [1]. Among them is an article by Rudolf (Hermann Arndt) Kohlrausch (*1809,\n\u2020\n1858) [2] in which he introduced the stretched exponential function Qt = Q0 [exp(\u2013\nBt\u03b1)] to interpret charge relaxation in a Leiden jar. This work was essentially forgotten\nthroughout most of the 20th century until the appearance of Ref. 3. Unfortunately,\nR.G. Palmer et al. [3] do not refer to the correct paper by R. Kohlrausch [2], referring\ninstead to an earlier Kohlrausch paper [4] in which he only qualitatively describes\nrelaxation phenomena in galvanometer threads. The fact that such mechanical\nrelaxation can also be represented by the stretched exponential function was not\npublished until many years later by Friedrich (Wilhelm Georg) Kohlrausch (*1840,\n\u2020\n1910) [5], the son of Rudolf Kohlrausch. Therefore, the credit for the introduction of\nthe concept is sometimes given to him. But the first time the stretched exponential\nfunction appeared in the literature is 1854 in [2].\nThe stretched exponential function was rediscovered in 1970 by Graham Williams\nand David C. Watts [6], who independently developed an equivalent expression and\nre-introduced the concept, stimulating its application to relaxation and scattering\nphenomena together with theoretical studies. Accordingly, the function was termed\nthe Williams-Watts (WW) function or the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function.\nThe Williams & Watts paper [6] achieved an exceptionally high impact, currently with\n2143 citations. We note that a complementary expression known as the Weibull\ndistribution [7] evolved a similar impact, primarily in the materials science and\nengineering literature. To complete the story: The term \"stretched exponential\" is first\nfound in [8]. Since 1900 Ref. 2 was first cited in 1906 by A. Joffe in [9] and Ref. 3 was\nfirst cited in 1943 by H. Leaderman in [10].\nEver since the highly cited Palmer paper [3] (1019 citations) appeared most papers\nreferring to Kohlrausch's work give the wrong reference [4]. This is clearly\ndemonstrated in Fig. 1 where the citations per year to [4] are shown to rise sharply\nafter the appearance of [3]. Additional proof that Ref. 3 is the source of the error\npropagation is obtained by looking at how many papers cite [3] and [4]\nsimultaneously (co-citations). The number of co-citations of these two papers is 143\n(the first one appearing in 1985) whereas the number of those co-citing [2] and [3] is\nonly 43. The Palmer paper [3], however, was not the first one to cite Ref. 4 instead of\nRef. 2. There are three pre-1984 citing papers which cited Ref. 4, but they received\naltogether less than 50 citations and are therefore unlikely to be responsible for the\npropagation of the confusion.\n\n\f2\n\nInitially, Williams & Watts were not aware of the early Kohlrausch papers and hence\ndid not refer to [2] or [4]. But their paper obviously was a strong stimulus for the\nsubsequent widespread application of the concept of the stretched exponential\nfunction and thereby caused the revival of the early works of R. Kohlrausch within the\nscientific literature. Co-citation analysis of the Williams & Watts paper [6] reveals that\n(1) almost 70 percent (716 out of 1052) of the total Kohlrausch citations were co-cited\nwith [6], and that (2) the number of co-citations of [4] and [6] is still higher (475) than\nof [2] and [6] (257). Ref. 2 and Ref. 4 are both not at all co-cited with the Weibull\npaper [7]. A summary of the citation data is shown in Table 1.\nFor comparison we show in Fig. 2 the citation history (citations per year) of [3], of [6],\nand of [7], together with the sum of [2] and [4]. Notice that while the citations of the\npapers by Williams & Watts [6] and by Weibull [7] increase with time, the citations of\nthe Palmer paper [3] have been continuously decreasing since 1987. The sum of the\ncitations of both Kohlrausch papers oscillates around 60 citations per year during the\npast 15 years. The yearly rate of incorrect citations far exceeded the rate of correct\ncitations until the year 2002, indicating that the citation error has been slowly\nrealized. In the following year, however, the time-curves intersected again, so that the\ntotal number of incorrect citations (713 since 1900, including 21 in PRL) remains\nmuch higher than the total number of correct citations (368 since 1900, including 5 in\nPRL). Although several papers (e.g. Ref. 11) mentioned the incorrectness in the\nrecent past, a reversal of the trend seems to be unlikely.\nFor the sake of completeness we note that many more papers (757 since 1991) have\nmentioned explicitly the name Kohlrausch (164 together with the term \"stretched\nexponential\"), 593 without citing any original source. This reference phenomenon is\nreferred to as \"informal citation\" [12]. The citation data mentioned here are based on\nthe Thomson/ISI Web of Science (WoS) covering the time period 1900 till present\n(currently, the pre-1900 citations of papers published before 1900 are not available).\nAlthough the name Kohlrausch is not very common, we have investigated the\npossibility of additional errors related to homonyms of Kohlrausch. To start with, a\nfew words concerning Friedrich Wilhelm Kohlrausch [5]: Since 1900 we find\naltogether 2019 citing papers referring to publications by F. W. Kohlrausch. Most of\nthem (573) relate to his book \"Praktische Physik\" which first appeared in 1870 and\nhas had a large number of editions since; the last one appeared in 1996 [13]. We\nalso find articles for additional 12 Kohlrauschs, most of them lowly cited, except for\nKarl Wilhelm Friedrich Kohlrausch (*1884, \u20201953), an Austrian (grandson of Rudolf\nKohlrausch and nephew of Friedrich Kohlrausch) who published 77 articles in\njournals and many more in books and reports, mostly (59) about the Raman effect.\nK.W.F. Kohlrausch is also responsible for some confusion in the literature concerning\nthe Raman effect: Some of his early articles, the first one published 1931 [14], and a\n\n\f3\nbook [15] on this subject, refer to it as the Smekal-Raman effect. A. Smekal was a\ncolleague of K.W.F. Kohlrausch who, five years prior to Raman's experimental\ndiscovery in 1928, wrote in 1923 a short article [16] on the theory of inelastic\nscattering (114 citations). Fortunately, K.W.F. Kohlrausch soon gave up his attempt\nto establish Smekal as a co-discoverer of the Raman effect. Although the term\nSmekal-Raman is found almost exclusively in the Austrian and the German literature,\nit first appeared in an American journal [17].\nReferences\n[1] W. Marx, M.
