I NTRODUCTION\nThe Vafa-Intriligator formula counts degree d maps from a smooth complex projective curve C to the Grassmannian G(r, N ) of rank r subspaces of the vector space CN ,\nunder incidence conditions with special Schubert subvarieties at fixed domain points.\nWhen finite, the number of these maps is expressed as the sum of evaluations of a rational function at distinct N th roots of unity. Such sums are fairly complicated in general,\nand are not immediately expressible in a compact form. In this paper we show that\nintersection numbers on the moduli space N of rank r and degree d stable bundles on\nC, in the case when r and d are relatively prime, arise as coefficients of highest-degree\nterms in N in Vafa-Intriligator sums. We explicitly compute these leading coefficients\nas iterated residues. We determine in this way all intersection numbers on N appearing\nin formulas of Verlinde type.\nExpressions for all top intersections of the cohomology generators on N were originally written down by Witten as possibly divergent infinite sums over the irreducible\nrepresentations of SU (r) [W1]. An argument of Szenes identified the convergent Witten sums as iterated residues [Sz]. The simplest instances of these top-pairing formulas occur in rank 2; they received many algebro-geometric or symplectic proofs. By\ncontrast, the higher rank case is more involved. A symplectic derivation of all of the\nintersection theory of N was given by Jeffrey and Kirwan [JK], with intersection numbers expressed as iterated residues. The Jeffrey-Kirwan approach is very powerful, yet\nnot easily accessible to the uninitiated: technical difficulties concerning localization on\nsingular non-compact moduli spaces have to be carefully considered. A different approach is due to Liu who obtained, by heat kernel methods, some of the intersection\nnumbers as Witten sums [L]. Another derivation via large level limits of Verlinde-type\nformulas was hinted at in the last section of [TW]. Finally, results for arbitrary groups\nwere obtained by Meinrenken [Me] via symplectic geometry.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALINA MARIAN AND DRAGOS OPREA\n\nThe goal of our paper is to present a surprisingly simple and entirely finite dimensional algebro-geometric derivation of the Witten-Szenes-Jeffrey-Kirwan-residue formulas. The inspiration for the current work was the connection between the intersection theory of N and the enumerative geometry of Grassmannians, which emerged\nseveral years ago in the mathematics and physics literature [BDW] [W2]. On the physics\nside, Witten equates the Verlinde formula giving the dimension of non-abelian (possibly parabolic) theta functions on C with a certain count of maps to a Grassmannian.\nA precise statement (in the absence of parabolic structures) is given later in this introduction. Witten argues that the Grassmannian nonlinear sigma model and the gauged\nWZW model of U (r)/U (r), obtained after integrating out matter fields, arise as different\nlarge-distance limits of the same physical theory, a gauged linear sigma model. Some\nof the topological amplitudes of the gauged WZW model, which has a direct link to\nthe Verlinde algebra, and of the Grassmannian sigma model should therefore be closely\nrelated. In genus 0, this relation was mathematically established by Agnihotri [A], who\nproved that the small quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian G(r, N ) is isomorphic to the Verlinde algebra of the unitary group U (r) at level N \u2212 r. In higher genus,\nwe will extract (roughly half of) the intersection theory of the moduli space of bundles\nfrom the count of maps to the Grassmannian. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, it may be possible to\nrelate our method (even if only philosophically) to the more abstract approach pursued\nin [T][TW]. Note however that the bounded geometry of our setup lends itself to direct\nintersection-theoretic calculations, via simpler machinery, avoiding the use of K-theory\non the moduli stack.\nTo start, we let N be the moduli space of rank r, degree d stable bundles with fixed\ndeterminant on a smooth complex projective curve C of genus g \u2265 2. We will frequently\nuse the notation \u1e21 = g \u2212 1. We assume throughout that r and d are coprime. Let V be\nthe universal bundle on N \u00d7 C. We K\u00fcnneth-decompose its Chern classes\nci (V) = ai \u2297 1 +\n\n2g\nX\n\nbji \u2297 \u03b4j + fi \u2297 \u03c9, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r,\n\nj=1\n\nwith respect to a fixed symplectic basis 1, \u03b41 , . . . , \u03b42g , \u03c9 of H \u22c6 (C). The classes ai , bji , fi\nthus obtained are generators for the cohomology of N [AB]. They are however not\ncanonical, since the universal bundle V is only defined up to tensoring with a line bundle from the base N .\nA normalization process is required to kill this ambiguity and obtain invariant classes.\nTo this end, we write x1 , . . . , xr for the Chern roots of V, and let\n1\n(1)\nx\u0304 = (x1 + . . . + xr ) , x\u0304i = xi \u2212 x\u0304, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\nr\nth\nThe i symmetric elementary polynomial in the normalized variables is written as\nsi (x\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304r ) = \u0101i \u2297 1 +\n\n2g\nX\n\nb\u0304ji \u2297 \u03b4j + f \u0304i \u2297 \u03c9, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\n\nj=1\n\nFor instance,\n\n1\nd(r \u2212 1)\na1 = c1 (N ),\nf \u03042 = f2 \u2212\nr\n2r\n\n\fINTERSECTIONS ON THE MODULI SPACE OF BUNDLES\n\n3\n\n\u01011 = 0, and \u0101i = si (\u03b8\u03041 , . . . , \u03b8\u0304r ).\nHere \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8r are the Chern roots of V|N \u00d7point .\nWe can now explain the main result.

The iterated residue is computed from right to\nleft, at each step keeping all but one of the Ys fixed.\nTheorem 1 will be obtained by exploiting the connection between the intersection\ntheory of N and that of a suitable compactification of the scheme Mord (C, G(r, N )) of\ndegree d morphisms from C to the Grassmannian G(r, N ). This compactification, the\nscheme Quotd (ON , r, C) constructed by Grothendieck, is the fine moduli space of short\nexact sequences\n(6)\n\n0 \u2192 E \u2192 ON \u2192 F \u2192 0,\n\nwhere F is a degree d, rank r quotient sheaf of the trivial bundle. With the aid of the dual\nuniversal bundle E \u2228 on Quotd (ON , r, C)\u00d7C, we obtain, via the K\u00fcnneth decomposition,\ncohomology classes denoted by a, b, f:\n(7)\n\nci (E \u2228 ) = ai \u2297 1 +\n\n2g\nX\n\nbji \u2297 \u03b4j + fi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\n\nj=1\n\nWhen the degree d is large, it was established in [BDW] that Quotd (ON , r, C) is irreducible, generically smooth of the expected dimension\ne = \u03c7(E \u2228 \u2297 F ) = N d \u2212 r(N \u2212 r)\u1e21.\nIn general, this space may be singular and of the wrong dimension. Nonetheless,\nQuotd (ON , r, C) comes equipped with a canonical perfect obstruction theory, and hence\nwith a virtual fundamental cycle [MO]\n\u0002\n\u0003vir\n\u2208 Ae (Quotd (ON , r, C)).\nQuotd (ON , r, C)\n\n\f4\n\nALINA MARIAN AND DRAGOS OPREA\n\nPolynomials in the a, b, f classes can then be evaluated against this virtual fundamental\ncycle. In particular, the Vafa-Intriligator formula (19) proved in [ST], [MO] expresses\ntop intersections of a-classes as sums over N th roots of unity.\nNote that all intersection numbers appearing in the Verlinde formula are covered\nby Theorem 1. A derivation of this formula via Riemann-Roch was obtained in the last\nsection of [JK]; the computation for arbitrary structure groups was pursued in [BL].\nDenoting by L the ample generator of Pic (N ), we have c1 (L) = r f \u03042 , hence\n(8)\n\ns\n\n\u03c7(L ) =\n\nZ\n\nexp(sr f \u03042 ) Todd(N ) =\nN\n\nZ\n\nN\n\n\u0001\nexp (s + 1)r f \u03042 \u00c2(N ).\n\nHere, \u00c2(N ) is a polynomial in the \u0101i classes, which is explicitly given in terms of the\nChern roots \u03b8i as\n!2\u1e21\nY\n\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j\n\u00c2(N ) =\n.\n\u03b8i \u2212\u03b8j\n2\nsinh\ni<j\n2\nThe evaluation of the Verlinde Euler characteristic (8) is immediate from equation (5).\nThe emerging residue answer can be recast effortlessly as an intersection number on\nQuotd (Or(s+1) , r, C) by a backwards application of the residue formula (31) of section 3.\nThe result is the following striking equality, derived by physical considerations in [W2],\n\n(9)\n\nZ\n1\nas(d\u2212r\u1e21)+d .\n\u03c7(L ) =\n(s + 1)g [Quotd (Or(s+1) ,r,C)]vir r\ns\n\nMoreover, when d is large, intersections of a classes on the Quot scheme have enumerative meaning [B]. In particular, the right-hand-side integral of (9) is the finite count of\ndegree d maps to the Grassmannian G(r, r(s + 1)) with incidences at fixed s(d \u2212 r\u1e21) + d\ndomain points with sub-Grassmannians G(r, r(s + 1) \u2212 1) \u0592\u2192 G(r, r(s + 1)) in general\nposition.\nIn a different direction, the argument which gives Theorem 1, combined with a rescaling trick we learned from [EK], leads to a vanishing result about intersections on Quot,\nwhich will be presented in the last section of this work.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, we explain the setup of [Ma] which relates\nintersections on the moduli space of stable bundles to intersections on Quotd (ON , r, C)\nin the large N regime. Using as starting point the Vafa-Intriligator formula, the relevant\nevaluations on Quotd (ON , r, C) are cast as iterated residues in Section 3. Upon extracting the appropriate asymptotic coefficients of these residues, we immediately obtain in\nSection 4 the formulas of Theorem 1. For completeness, we also indicate how the results\nare expressed as infinite sums indexed by the irreducible representations of SU (r), as\nin [W1]. Finally, the vanishing of intersections on Quotd (ON , r, C) will be proved in the\nlast section.\n\n\fINTERSECTIONS ON THE MODULI SPACE OF BUNDLES\n\n2. V ERLINDE - TYPE\n\nINTERSECTIONS THROUGH THE\n\nQ UOT\n\n5\n\nSCHEME\n\nWe start by explaining the setup for the proof of Theorem 1. Traditionally, one studies\nthe intersection theory on the moduli space N of rank r degree d stable bundles with\nfixed determinant. However, our computations will be most naturally carried on the\nmoduli space M of stable bundles V with varying determinant. These intersections\nwill be transfered to N via the the degree r 2g \u00e9tale cover\n\u03c4 : N \u00d7 J \u2192 M,\ngiven by tensoring with degree 0 line bundles in the Jacobian J of C. When switching\nfrom N to M, we will abusively use the same notations for the universal bundle, its\nChern roots and the K\u00fcnneth components of its Chern classes.\nThe main technical ingredient of our argument is a precise relationship between the\nintersection theory of M and that of Quotd (ON , r, C). We will assume that d is large\ncompared to N , r and g to ensure that Quotd (ON , r, C) is irreducible of the expected\ndimension. We will think of the points of Quotd (ON , r, C), that is of the short exact\nsequences (6), as N tuples of sections of the bundle E \u2228 which generically generate the\nfiber. Requiring that V = E \u2228 be stable and not demanding that the sections generically\ngenerate, we arrive at a different moduli space, birational to Quotd (ON , r, C), which\nwe denote by PN,r,d . PN,r,d finely parametrizes pairs (V, \u03c6) where V is a stable rank r\ndegree d bundle on C, and \u03c6 is a non-zero N tuple of holomorphic sections, considered\nprojectively\n\u03c6 : ON \u2192 V.\nWhen d is large, the space \u03c0 : PN,r,d \u2192 M is the projective bundle PN,r,d = P(HN ),\nwhere\nH = pr\u22c6 V,\nwith pr denoting the projection from M \u00d7 C to M.\nThere is a universal morphism\n\u03a6 : \u00f8N \u2192 U on PN,r,d \u00d7 C,\nand it is easy to see that\n(10)\n\nU = \u03c0 \u22c6 V \u2297 OP (1).\n\nWe K\u00fcnneth decompose the Chern classes of U as\n(11)\n\nci (U ) = ai \u2297 1 +\n\n2g\nX\n\nbji \u2297 \u03b4j + fi \u2297 \u03c9, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\n\nj=1\n\nThe reader who compared (7) and (11) may have noticed the abusive notation. The\nreason for using the same symbols for analogous, but certainly different classes on PN,r,d\nand Quotd (ON , r, C), is that both moduli spaces and their universal structures agree on\nan open subscheme. Usually we will carefully distinguish between the different a, b, f\nclasses, by always mentioning the moduli spaces where the intersections are computed.\nAs before, we let \u0101i , b\u0304ji , f\u0304i be the normalized classes either on Quotd (ON , r, C) or PN,r,d .\n(Note however that the universal structures on Quotd (ON , r, C) and PN,r,d are canonical.)\nWe summarize our setup in the following diagram\n\n\f6\n\nALINA MARIAN AND DRAGOS OPREA\n\nMord (C, G(r, N )) \u0592\u2192 Quotd (ON , r, C) o\n\n/ PN,r,d\n\n.\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nMo\n\n\u03c4\n\nN \u00d7J\n\nLet us consider the intersection product\n(12)\n\nZ\n\nQuotd (O N ,r,C)\n\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * aM\nr ,\n\nwhere P(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) is a polynomial in the normalized \u0101 classes of total weighted degree\nat most r 2 \u1e21 + 1, and M is such that\n(13)\n\ndeg P + rM = N d \u2212 r(N \u2212 r)\u1e21.\n\nThis choice is possible since d and r are coprime. In addition to our initial assumption\nthat d is large compared to N , r and g, we will require that N be large with respect\nto r and g. This warrants the transfer of certain intersections from Quotd (ON , r, C)\nto PN,r,d , by making sure that the nonoverlapping loci of Quotd (ON , r, C) and PN,r,d\nare avoided. Indeed, when N is large, the main theorem of [Ma] asserts that the class\nN\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * aM\nr evaluates identically on Quotd (O , r, C) and PN,r,d . It is moreover\neasy to observe, using (10), that the normalized \u0101 classes on PN,r,d and M are related by\npullback\n(14)\n\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) = \u03c0 \u22c6 P(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ).\n\nConsequently, we have that for N large relative to r and g, and d large relative to N , r\nand g,\n(15)\nZ\nZ\nZ\nM\nM\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * \u03c0\u22c6 (aM\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * ar =\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * ar =\nr ).\nQuotd (O N ,r,C)\n\nPN,r,d\n\nM\n\nThe observation which lies at the heart of the argument for Theorem 1 is that the topdegree term in N of the intersection (12) is closely related to the intersection numbers\nwhich are the subject of the theorem. We will therefore study the leading behavior in N\nof (15). N is however assumed to be small compared to the degree d. We remove this\nassumption by observing that all intersections appearing in (15) depend only on d modulo r. This is clear for the rightmost intersection by the arguments below, and it follows\nfor the one on Quotd (ON , r, C) from the explicit evaluation via the Vafa-Intriligator formula. Alternatively, we can reduce the degree d on Quotd (ON , r, C) directly, making\nuse of the virtual fundamental class on Quotd (ON , r, C) constructed in [MO] and Theorem 2 there, which compares the virtual cycles for same values of d modulo r.\nLet us examine the pushforward \u03c0\u22c6 (aM\nr ). By (10), the Chern roots of U restricted to\nPN,r,d \u00d7 {point} equal \u03c0 \u22c6 \u03b81 + \u03b6, . . . , \u03c0 \u22c6 \u03b8r + \u03b6, with \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8r being the Chern roots of\n\n\fINTERSECTIONS ON THE MODULI SPACE OF BUNDLES\n\n7\n\nV|M\u00d7point , and \u03b6 = c1 (OP (1)).

It will be then easy to extract the leading N coefficient\nin the next section.

One can include the odd cohomology classes b\u0304ji in the calculation by applying a suitable version of Vafa-Intriligator involving odd b classes on Quotd (ON , r, C).\nSuch statements are proved, in a particular case, in Proposition 2 of [MO], but the\nmethod used there extends in general. To keep the notation as simple as possible, we\ndecided not to write down the general formulas, leaving them to the interested reader.\nThe remaining intersections involving other f classes can be lifted easily to the Quot\nscheme and can in principle be computed there by equivariant localization as set up in\n[MO].

The exact equations are obtained by linearity from\nthe ai -monomials of the product P * S, by requiring incidences at distinct domain points\nfor each occurrence of ai . It would be interesting to interpret these enumerative constraints geometrically.\nProof. Fix polynomials P and S as in the statement of the proposition. Using the VafaIntriligator formula we obtain the following sum over unordered tuples of distinct roots\nof unity\nZ\nP(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) * S(a1 , . . . , ar ) * aM\nr =\n[Quotd (O N ,r,C)]vir\n\n=\n\nuN r\u1e21 X\nR(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) * T(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) * (\u03bb1 * * * \u03bbr )M \u2212\u1e21 ,\nr!\n\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbr\n\nwhere T is the polynomial S expressed in terms of the Chern roots, and R is defined as\nbefore by equations (21) and (22). We rescale the variables to obtain \u03bbr = 1, and express\neverything in terms of the \u03b1s defined in (24). We are then to prove that\nX\nmr\u22121\n1\nR(\u03b11 * . . . * \u03b1r\u22121 , . . . , \u03b1r\u22121 , 1) * T(\u03b11 * . . . * \u03b1r\u22121 , . . . , \u03b1r\u22121 , 1) * \u03b1m\n1 * * * \u03b1r\u22121 = 0.\n(\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1r\u22121 )\u2208C\n\nHere m1 , . . . , mr\u22121 are defined as in (26).

On the other hand, the intersection number this residue\ncomputes is independent of t, and therefore it must vanish.\n\u0003\nRemark 2. By transferring the intersection (38) to PN,r,d and pushing it forward to M,\nProposition 1 is seen to follow from the vanishing of the Pontryagin ring of M in degree\ngreater than r(r \u2212 1)\u1e21, proved in [EK].\nConversely, it is tempting to speculate that the vanishing statement (38) implies the\nvanishing of the Pontryagin ring of N . This is true when r = 3 as shown below. In\ngeneral, taking S = 1 and considering the highest order term in N of the pushforward\nalong \u03c0 yields\nZ\nexp(f \u03042 ) * P(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ) = 0 for deg P > r(r \u2212 1)\u1e21.\nN\n\nAn analysis of the full N asymptotics of the pushforward of S(a1 , . . . , ar ) * aM\nr may be\npossible, if cumbersome.

In higher rank, it is to be surmised that the consideration of the full\nN asymptotics of the pushforwards S(a1 , . . . , ar ) * aM\nr for all polynomials S subject to the\nassumption of Proposition 1, will inductively give the vanishing of all evaluations\nZ\nf \u03042k2 * * * f \u0304rkr * P(\u01012 , . . . , \u0101r ).\nN\n\nR EFERENCES\n[A] S.
