To date, attention focused\nlargely on electric phenomena. Recently, much consideration is also given to spin-dependent thermoelectric effects\nwhich opened up the new research field of spin caloritronics [3]. A potential milestone of this emerging field were\nthe recent observations of the spin Seebeck effect in ferromagnets [4\u20136], where a spin voltage develops in response\nto an applied temperature gradient. This could be valuable for spintronics applications as the operating principle of a spin battery. Indeed thermally driven spin injection has recently been realized experimentally [7].\nBesides such practical implications, the spin Seebeck\neffect also raises theoretical puzzles. Remarkably, the\nspin chemical potential is observed to vary (quasi)linearly\nalong the sample [4\u20136]. This is surprising since unlike\ncharge, the electronic spin is generally not conserved due\nto spin-orbit interactions or magnetic impurities. While\ncharge conservation implies that the chemical potential\ndrops linearly, spin non-conservation would seem to imply that the spin chemical potential should vary exponentially on the scale of the spin diffusion length [8].\nProposed mechanisms for the linear spin-voltage profile are based on spin pumping between ferromagnet and\ncontacts [9\u201311], with previous theoretical works [9\u201312] focusing on ferromagnetic insulators or magnon drag. In\nthis paper, we consider the contribution of the conduction electrons to the spin Seebeck effect in a ferromagnetic metal. In particular, we discuss the question under\nwhat circumstances a (quasi)linear variation of the spin\nchemical potential can be obtained. Although it is well\nknown that elastic spin-flip scattering leads to an exponential decay of the spin chemical potential near the\nedges of the sample [8], we find that the situation changes\nqualitatively when additional inelastic spin-flip scattering\nis present as, e.g., arising from the exchange interaction\nwith magnetic impurities.\nAs a model system, we consider inelastic spin-flip scattering effected by the exchange interaction with partially\nspin-polarized (paramagnetic) impurities. In the absence\nof elastic spin relaxation of the conduction electrons or\n\nwithout additional relaxation mechanisms for the impurity spins, a truly linear dependence of the spin voltage\ncan be recovered due to the interplay of a conservation\nlaw for a combination of spin and heat currents with the\nspin asymmetry inherent to inelastic spin-flip scattering.\nRemarkably, even in the more general case with additional direct spin relaxation for both conduction electrons\nand impurities, we find a quasilinear variation of the spin\nvoltage whose characteristic scale is much larger than the\nspin diffusion length.\nAnother question raised by the experiment is the origin\nof the observed spin Seebeck effect [4]. In the absence of\nresponse functions which are off-diagonal in spin, linear\nresponse relates the spin-resolved charge and heat currents, J\u03c3 and JQ\u03c3 , to the gradients in the spin-resolved\nchemical potentials and temperatures, \u03bc\u03c3 and T\u03c3 ,\n\u03c3\u03c3 S\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u2207\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212\n\u2207T\u03c3\ne2\ne\n1\n= \u2212 T\u03c3 \u03c3\u03c3 S\u03c3 \u2207\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212 (\u03ba\u03c3 + T\u03c3 \u03c3\u03c3 S\u03c32 )\u2207T\u03c3 .

It is natural\nto ask whether the observed spin Seebeck effect indeed\noriginates from the spin thermopower S\u2212 = S\u2191 \u2212 S\u2193 . We\nfind that this occurs in special limits but is generically\nnot the case.\nModel.-We consider an itinerant ferromagnet where\nthe exchange interaction polarizes the electron spins\nthrough the mean field h and the electron dispersion\nis spin split, \u01ebp\u03c3 = \u01ebp \u2212 \u03c3h. Besides elastic potential\nscattering we assume that the electrons are subject to\ninelastic spin-flip scattering (with rate \u0393sf\n\u03c3 ) on partially\npolarized magnetic impurities. The electron spin can also\nrelax directly (\u0393dir\n\u03c3 ), e.g., via spin-orbit interaction. Similarly, the impurities can relax their spin directly (\u0393dir\ni ),\ne.g., via the combined action of spin-orbit interaction and\nphonons [13] in addition to spin-flip scattering with the\nconduction electrons (\u0393sf\ni ).\nOur discussion of the spin thermoelectric properties of\nthe ferromagnet is based on the kinetic equation\nel\ninel\n{\u2202t + vp\u03c3 * \u2207r + F * \u2207p }np\u03c3 = Sp\u03c3\n+ Sp\u03c3\n,\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nfor the electronic distribution function np\u03c3 .

Here, W \u03c3\u03c3 results from elastic\nimpurity scattering and can be spin dependent as, e.g.,\nfor spin polarized impurities, W \u03c3\u03c3\u0304 denotes the elastic direct spin relaxation, and W sf denotes the strength of the\ninelastic spin-flip scattering with paramagnetic impurities. For definiteness, we consider isotropic scattering\ndue to pointlike scatterers. Since paramagnetic impurities in a ferromagnet will be at least partially spin polarized, the impurity Sz -levels split by an energy of \u01ebi . We\ntreat the impurity spin as classical, i.e., we describe deviations from the maximal spin orientation with a bosonic\ndistribution function g, which is governed by\n\u0003\n\u2202g X inel \u0002 dir\ndir\n=\nSp\u2191 + Wi+ (g + 1) \u2212 Wi\u2212\ng .\n(4)\n\u2202t\np\ndir\nWi\u00b1\ndenotes direct relaxation of the impurity spin.\nTransport coefficients.-The transport coefficients \u03c3\u03c3 ,\nS\u03c3 , and \u03ba\u03c3 in Eq.

Here, N\u03c3\nis the electronic density of states and D\u03c3 = v\u03c32 /d\u0393a\u03c3\nis the diffusion coefficient in terms of v\u03c3 = vpF ,\u03c3 and\nsf\ndir\ntr\n\u0393a\u03c3 = \u0393tr\n\u03c3 + \u0393\u03c3 + \u0393\u03c3 , where \u0393\u03c3 is the transport rate for\nspin-conserving elastic scattering, \u0393dir\n= N\u03c3\u0304 (\u03bc0 )W \u03c3\u03c3\u0304 ,\n\u03c3\n\u01ebi\nsf\nsf\nand \u0393\u03c3 = N\u03c3\u0304 (\u03bc0 + \u03c3\u01ebi )(W /sinh kB T ) the rates for elastic and inelastic spin-flip scattering, respectively.

This implies,\nthat the linear spatial variation of the charge chemical\npotential \u03bc+ due to charge conservation is necessarily\naccompanied by a linear variation of the spin chemical\npotential when \u0393sf\n\u2212 is nonzero. Interestingly, the linear\ncontribution to \u03bc\u2212 is entirely determined by the collision\nintegral and thus insensitive to the response coefficients\nsuch as the conductivity.\nSpin thermoelectrics.-This mechanism does not carry\nover directly to spin thermoelectric effects since the latter\nare generically investigated in the absence of charge currents. Similarly, an ideal spin battery would also be operated without charge currents. Although charge conservation becomes inconsequential under these circumstances,\nwe find that a linear or quasilinear spatial dependence\nof the spin chemical potential due to inelastic spin-flip\nscattering persists under quite general circumstances.\nFor reference, we first review what happens without\ninelastic spin-flip scattering (\u0393sf = 0), as considered in\n[8]. Then, both the spin chemical potential and the spin\ntemperature T\u2212 = (T\u2191 \u2212 T\u2193 )/2 exhibit a purely exponential dependence, despite the presence of the conservation law \u2207 * JQ = 0 in addition to \u2207 * J = 0. The\nreason is that in the equations for the linear modes,\n\u03bc\u2212 and T\u2212 decouple completely from \u03bc+ and T+ =\n(1/2)[(T\u2191 \u2212 T0 ) + (T\u2193 \u2212 T0 )]/2.

If direct spin relaxation is negligible for both\nimpurity spins and conduction electrons, the mixing of\ncharge and spin components is accompanied by conservation of the heat and spin currents, \u2207*JQ = 0 as well as\n\u2207*Jspin = 0 leading to a linear spin voltage in the bulk of\nthe sample (see discussion below). More surprisingly, a\nlinear spin-voltage profile even persists in the presence of\ndirect spin relaxation of the impurity spins. At first sight,\nthis seems unlikely since both the heat current JQ and\nthe spin current Jspin are no longer conserved. However,\na linear combination of the two still satisfies a conservation law, namely\n\u2207 * (\u01ebi Jspin + 2JQ ) = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nSimilarly, a linear spin-voltage profile is possible when\nthere is direct spin relaxation of the conduction electrons,\nbut not of the impurity spins. While the spin relaxation\nfor the conduction electrons spoils the conservation laws\nfor the spin and the spin heat currents, the heat current\nremains conserved.\nIn the full problem where direct spin relaxation is\nincluded for both the impurity spins and the conduction electrons, only the charge current is conserved, and\nstrictly speaking, thermoelectric generation of a linear\nspin-voltage profile becomes impossible. Nevertheless, it\nis evident from the above discussion that the various currents differ in the robustness of their conservation laws,\nand consequently some of the length scales for the exponential decays can significantly exceed the spin diffusion\nlength. As a result, one may still find quasilinear spinvoltage profiles in practice even when a linear profile is no\nlonger possible. Specifically, we find from a lengthy but\nstraight-forward analysis that the three currents Jspin ,\nJQ , and JQspin involve the length scales\ndir\n1 \u03b1\u0393sf\n+ + \u0393+\n(12)\n2\nsf\ndir\nl 1 \u0393+ + \u0393+\n\"\n#\n\u2032\nsf\n\u0393sf\n\u01ebi \u0393dir\n1 \u03b1\ne\n\u2212\n+ \u0393\u2212\n2\nS+ \u2212 sf\n1/l3 \u2243 2\ndir\nsf\ndir\nl1 2 (\u0393sf\n\u0393\u2212\n+ + \u0393+ )(\u03b1\u0393+ + \u0393+ ) 2\u03b3\n\n1/l21 \u2243 e2\n\ndir\n\u0393sf\n+ + \u0393+\n,\n\u03c3+\n\n1/l22 \u2243\n\nwith S\u00b1 = (S\u2191 \u00b1S\u2193 ). Eq. (12) holds for low temperatures,\nkB T \u226a \u01ebF , and weak ferromagnets, h, \u01ebi \u226a \u01ebf .\n\n\f4\nThe length l1 is the shortest of the three length scales\nand corresponds to the usual spin diffusion length. The\nlength scale l2 is of the same order as the spin diffusion length, except when direct spin relaxation is weak\ncompared to spin-flip scattering on magnetic impurities.\nIn the latter situation, l2 becomes much larger than the\nspin diffusion length and diverges in the absence of direct spin relaxation. Importantly, l3 is generically much\nlarger than the spin diffusion length for weak ferromagnets. According to Eq. (12), the ratio l3 /l1 is of orsf 1/2\nder (\u01ebf /\u01ebi )(\u0393dir\n\u226b 1 when direct spin relaxation\n+ /\u0393+ )\ndir 1/2\ndominates and (\u01ebf /\u01ebi )(\u0393sf\n\u226b 1 in the opposite\n+ /\u0393+ )\nlimit when direct spin relaxation is weak. The length\nscale l3 diverges when no spin relaxation is present for\nelectrons or for impurity spins, as well as in the absence\nof inelastic spin-flip scattering.\nSpin voltage.-The largeness of l3 allows for the thermoelectric generation of a quasilinear spin voltage profile. To illustrate this result and to assess the role of\nthe spin thermopower S\u2212 , we consider a ferromagnet of\nlength L with a constant temperature gradient applied\nalong the x-direction, similar to the experimental setup\nin [4]. We then determine the spin-voltage profile from\nEqs.

For low temperatures kB T \u226a \u01ebf and weak ferromagnets h, \u01ebi \u226a \u01ebf , we then find the spin chemical\npotential profile\n\u03bc\u2212 = \u2212e (S\u2212 T+ + S+ T\u2212 )\n\n(13)\n\nin the bulk of the sample with T+ \u2243 \u2206T (x/L) and T\u2212 \u2243\nsf\nsf \u2032\nsf\nT+ [(eS+ /2\u03b3)\u01ebi \u0393sf\n+ \u22122\u0393\u2212 \u2212\u01ebi \u0393+ ]/2\u0393+ . Note that both S\u2212\nand S+ contribute to the spin chemical potential profile,\nand it will in general depend on the specifics of the system\nwhich of the two terms dominates.\nIn the general case, with nonzero direct spin relaxation\nfor both the conduction electrons and the impurities, we\ncan focus on the quasilinear contribution decaying on the\nlargest length scale l3 and obtain\n\u03bc\u2212 \u2243 \u03b1\n\ne\nsf\nsf \u2032\n2 S+ \u0393\u2212 \u2212 \u03b3\u0393\u2212\nT+\ndir\n\u03b1\u0393sf\n+ + \u0393+\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\u0393sf + \u0393dir\n+\n\u2212 \u03b3 +sf\nT\u2212\n\u03b1\u0393+ + \u0393dir\n+\n\n(14)\n\nwith T+ \u2243 \u2206T sinh(x/l3 )/2 sinh(L/2l3 ) and T\u2212 \u2243\nsf\nsf \u2032\nsf\ndir\nT+ [(eS+ /2\u03b3)\u01ebi \u0393sf\n+ \u2212 2\u0393\u2212 \u2212 \u01ebi \u0393+ ]/2(\u0393+ + \u0393+ ). Interestingly, there is no longer a contribution which involves S\u2212 .\nThe reason for this is that the contribution of S\u2212 is subdominant in the sense that its spatial profile is controlled\nby l2 rather than l3 . We therefore find that generically,\nthe spin thermopower does not contribute significantly\nto the spin Seebeck effect.\nConclusions.-We have shown that a (quasi)linear\nspin-voltage profile can be generated thermoelectrically\nin a ferromagnet with paramagnetic impurities. In the\n\nabsence of direct spin relaxation of conduction electrons\nor impurities, the spin chemical potential acquires a\nstrictly linear component due to conservation of a composite current made up from the heat and spin currents.\nMore generally, this conservation law is only approximate\nand a quasilinear behavior of the spin chemical potential\nemerges. Surprisingly, the resulting (quasi)linear spin\nvoltage is directly related to the spin thermopower only\nwhen neither impurities nor conduction electrons are subject to direct spin relaxation. While it is not clear to\nwhich degree our model results apply directly to the recent experiments, they show that a full understanding of\nthe observed quasilinear dependence of the spin chemical\npotential may also involve purely electronic mechanisms.\nThe underlying physics of the quasilinear dependence\nof the spin chemical potential is the spin asymmetry\nof inelastic spin-flip scattering caused by partially spinpolarized magnetic impurities. Both the spin asymmetry\nand the inelasticity should also be a feature of scattering\nof electrons on magnons in itinerant ferromagnets. For\nthis reason, our results suggest that it would be interesting to extend the kinetic theory to include the effects of\nmagnons which however, unlike impurities, have a finite\ndispersion and propagate.\nOur analysis also neglects electron-electron interactions. On the one hand, these will modify the response\nfunctions \u03c3\u03c3 , \u03ba\u03c3 , and S\u03c3 , e.g., by intoducing off-diagonal\nspin-drag components. In addition, they provide another\ndecay channel for the spin heat current which decays on\nthe shortest length scale even in the absence of electronelectron scattering. We therefore expect that electronelectron interactions modify our results only in quantitative detail. We hope to return to these issues in a future\npublication.\nAcknowledgments.-We acknowledge financial support\nthrough SPP 1285 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).\n\n[1] I. Z\u0306uti\u0107, J.
