Why\nCosmic Rays, discovered by Hess nearly 30 years before were, still in 1939, such\nan interesting topics for these distinguished scientists?\nThe answer lies in Table 1. In the years preceding 1937 both the first antiparticle (the positron) and the first unstable elementary particles (\u03bc\u00b1 ) were\ndiscovered in Cosmic Rays. Many more particles were to be discovered during\nthe following years analyzing the Cosmic Radiation, making Cosmic Rays symposia very exciting until at least 1953, when experiments at accelerators started\nto systematically discover new elementary particles while Cosmic Rays experiments suddenly stopped finding them.\nTable 1.

A growing number of physicists is\nthen turning again to CR with new experimental techniques aiming to extend\nby orders of magnitude the sensitivities reached by past experiments.\nIn particular a number of space born experiments have been proposed to\nmeasure, with unrivalled accuracy, the composition of primary high energy CR,\nsearching for new phenomena not accessible to present accelerators.\nIn this paper we will review these experiments and their physics potential.\nThe paper is organized in two parts. In the first part I will discuss the charac-\n\nFig. 1. High Energy Cosmic Rays composition [1]\n\nteristics of the CR flux, the beam nature gives us, reviewing the status of our\nknowledge of their energy spectrum and composition. In the second part I will\ndiscuss some of the space born experiments planned in the next future which\nwill contribute to the quest for answers to various unsolved questions in Astro\nParticle physics.\n\n2\n\nUnderstanding Nature's Beam\n\nThe Universe communicate with us by sending to Earth a continuous flow of\nradiation of different kind. Here we are interested to the high energy part of\nthe spectrum (E > O(GeV )). Cosmic Rays traditionally refer to the charged\n\n\f4\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\ncomponent of high the energy particles travelling through the galaxy (Figure\n1): in order of abundance p \u223c 80%,4 He \u223c 15%, e\u2212 : O(1%), e+ : O(0.1%), p\u0304 :\nO(0.01%)). In addition to p and 4 He, there is a composite hadronic component\nincluding all other nuclei and long lived isotopes, totalling about a few % of the\ntotal CR flux.\nThere are however two other forms of energetic radiation which are relevant\nfor Astro Particle physics. The first is the high energy part of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, gamma rays above \u223c 100 M eV . Their flux is at the level of 10\u22125 of\nthe CR flux. Gamma rays have an important property that charged CR do not\nhave, namely they travel along straight lines, undisturbed by the magnetic field\nand reproducing the images of their sources.\n\nFig. 2. Left: the flux of charged cosmic rays. Right: measurement and uncertainty on\nthe primary CR spectrum (proton and He).The accurate knowledge of this part of the\nCR spectrum is important for the understanding of the atmospheric neutrino flux [2].\n\nThe second component are the neutrinos, which would also allow source\nimaging: at high energy the primary neutrino flux is much lower and steeper\nwith increasing energy than for charged CR, with the exception of the secondary\natmospheric component induced by high energy CR hitting the atmosphere.\nAround 1 GeV the neutrino flux is of the order of the flux of high energy gamma\nrays, but because of their low cross section, \u03bd \u2032 s are much harder to detect.\nIf we are plan to use this energetic radiation to search for new particles or\nnew effects, we must know the properties of Nature's beam with the best possible\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n5\n\naccuracy. Which is our current level on the knowledge of the Cosmic Radiation\nand what we can expect in the coming future?\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe charged CR component\nCharged hadrons\n\nOver the last 40 years the hadronic CR component has been measured systematically, using balloons (mostly), space born (sometimes), and ground based\ndetectors. The most complete information is obtained by particle spectrometers,\nexperiments able to measure directly the CR composition through the determination of the charge, the sign of the charge, the momentum and the velocity of\neach particle. Often, however, simpler apparatus were used, based on calorimeters, emulsion chambers or Cerenkov detectors: in these cases only partial information were obtained. Until recently the most sophisticated CR spectrometers\nwere flown on balloons operating between 30 and 35 km of height (BESS[3],\nMASS[4], CAPRICE[5], IMAX[6]) but in 1998 a large magnetic spectrometer,\nAMS[7], has been operated in space, providing for the first time a very precise\nmeasurement on the composition of primary CR before their entrance in the\natmosphere.\n\nFig. 3. Cosmic deuteron measurements[8,9,10,11,12]\n\nThe flux of the main CR component, the protons, is known with 5 \u2212 10%\naccuracy up to \u223c 200 GeV , and with 10\u221230% accuracy up to \u223c 100 T eV (Figure\n2) [2]. Helium flux is known with 10% accuracy up to \u223c 10 GeV but above\nthis energy the measurements are rather poor. Light Z > 2 nuclei have been\n\n\f6\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\nmeasured with about 5% accuracy only up to \u223c 35 GeV . It would be important\nto extend the energy range for precise measurements of hadrons up to about\n10 T eV because they are the source of the atmospheric neutrinos used for the\ndetermination measurement of the neutrino mass in underground experiments.\nFor the study of CR composition, precise measurements of some stable isotopes like Deuterium, Boron and Carbon or long-lived isotopes like 9 Be are\nparticularly important to understand the propagation and trapping mechanisms\nof CR in our Galaxy. Accurate measurements of D are available only up a few\nGV of rigidity (Figure 3) while the knowledge of the cosmologically important\nratio 9 Be/10 Be is very poorly known above about hundred M V of rigidity.\n3.2\n\nAntiprotons\n\nAntiprotons are a rare but interesting hadronic component of high energy CR,\nbecause they could be produced by exotic sources like antimatter dominated\nregions or by the decay or annihilation of new particles. Their flux ratio to\nprotons is at the level of O(10\u22124 ) at kinetic energies around 1 GeV . This rate\nis in agreement with the expectation that p\u0304 are produced in high energy CR\ninteractions with the interstellar medium. However in more than 40 years of\nexperiments with balloons, only a few thousands p\u0304 have been measured, mostly\nwith energies below 10 GeV (Figure 4). Statistical errors are then quite large,\nin particular below 1 GeV and above 10 GeV : also systematic errors due to\nuncertainties in the modelling of the propagation in the Interstellar Medium or\nof the solar modulation are still at the level of 20 \u2212 30%.\n3.3\n\nThe charged leptons\n\nDue to their lower flux (\u223c 0.5% for e\u2212 and \u223c 0.05% for e+ around 1 GeV ) and\ntheir steeply falling spectrum, statistical uncertainties on the measurement of\nthe spectra of the two stable leptons are larger; the experimental situation gets\nvery confused above a few GeV (Figure 5). Precision measurement of electrons\nand positrons are important since, being their fluxes quite low and with a strong\ncharge asymmetry, contribution form exotic sources like supersymmetric particles annihilation could distort the e+ /e\u2212 ratio at a level which could detectable\nby an high precision experiment[15].\n3.4\n\nFuture experiments\n\nDuring the next 5 years our knowledge of the flux and composition of CR will\nbe greatly improved thanks to two space borne spectrometers, PAMELA on a\nRussian rocket in 2003-2006[16] and AMS-02 on the International Space Station\non 2006-2009[17]. These two experiments will increase the statistical samples of\ncharged CR by a few to several orders of magnitude. AMS-02, in particular,\nthanks to its strong magnetic field and large geometrical factor, will be able to\nextend these measurements well in to the T eV region, covering a region which is\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n7\n\nFig. 4. Compilation of antiproton measurements. A simulated measurement of the\nAMS-02 experiment on the ISS is also reported. For all balloon data and models see[13]\nand reference therein. For AMS data see[7]\n\ninteresting for various physics topics and which today is very poorly known. For\na discussion on the improvement expected from AMS-02 on the hadronic CR\ncomponent see [18]. Space born experiments operating for three years or more\nare much more accurate that balloon flights lasting only about one day. Long\nduration balloons experiments lasting for 20 days or more, however, could be\ncompetitive, as it is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Compilation of e+ (top left), e\u2212 (bottom left) and e+ /(e\u2212 + e+ ) (right) data:\nlabels corresponds to the various references cited in [14]. A simulated long exposure\nresult from AMS-02 is also included, for the case m\u03c7 = 275 GeV /c2 [15]. All experiments\nare balloon borne spectrometers with the exception of AMS 98 and AMS-02 which are\nspace borne spectrometers\n\nhave a good sensitivity to the lower energy part of the CR spectrum and will\nperform a precise measurement of low energy p\u0304. On the other side the space borne\nPAMELA spectrometer, in spite of its small aperture, is a timely experiment\nand will have a chance to perform high statistic CR measurements in the period\nbetween AMS-01 and AMS-02.\nAt energies around the knee (\u223c 1015 eV = 1 P eV ) and above, all measurements come nowadays from large area ground based arrays. At these energies the\nCR elemental composition can be determined only by modelling the interaction\nof CR with the atmosphere and it is affected by large uncertainties. To solve this\nproblem a long duration, large acceptance, space borne experiment, ACCESS,\nhas been considered[20] either for deployment on the International Space Station\nor as a free flyer.\nGround based large area arrays have measured the CR spectrum (not the\ncomposition) up to Extreme Energies (1021 eV = 1 ZeV ) and they are at the\nmoment the only experiments able to measure these very rare events. At these\nenergies the flux is so low that eventually it will becomes unpractical to extend\nthe surface or the time of exposure of ground based experiments. The largest\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n9\n\nexperiment of this kind, Auger[21], is being built right now. The next step will,\nhowever, to look to the fluorescence induced by the EECR showers from space,\nas proposed by EUSO[22], an experiment planned on the International Space\nStation and capable to collect 10-50 times more statistics than Auger or by\nKLYPVE[23] planned on a Russian free flyer.\n\n4\n\nThe neutral CR component\n\n4.1\n\nHigh energy gamma rays\n\nHigh energy gamma rays are a rare (O(10\u22125 )) component of the cosmic radiation which is not traditionally included in a CR review paper. However high\nenergy gamma rays are produced by the same sources producing high energy CR\nand carry complementary information. They should then be considered when\ndiscussing Astro Particle physics, in particular since their study could give important contributions to the understanding the problem of the origin of dark\nmatter. Their energy spectrum could, in fact, be influenced by exotic sources\nlike neutralino annihilations taking place at the center of the galaxy. Most of the\nhigh energy gamma rays data have been collected by the EGRET experiment\non the CGRO satellite during the 90\u2032 s. Since the end of the CGRO program\n(1999 \u2212 2000) there are no experiments measuring high energy gamma rays in\nspace. During the present decade there will be three space borne experiments\nwhich will be able to measure high energy gamma rays: AGILE[24] (2003) a\nsmall scientific mission of the Italian Space Agency, AMS-02 on the International\nSpace Station (2006)[25] and GLAST[26] (2007). These experiments will be able\nto cover the region up to \u223c 300 GeV competing with ground base Cerenkov\ndetectors which meanwhile will try to lower their threshold below \u223c 50 GeV .\n4.2\n\nHigh energy neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are a very important part of the Cosmic Radiation. Their spectrum\n(Figure 6) extend over several orders of magnitudes like for the charged CR\ncomponent, but is rich of features coming from the various physical process at\nwork.\nNeutrinos have a two great advantages and one disadvantage with respect to\ncharged CR:\nAdvantages:\n\u2022 1) they travel on straight lines so neutrino astronomy is a possibility;\n\u2022 2) they have a small interaction cross section so they are basically unaffected\nby the GZK[27] cutoff and can reach us from the edges of the universe (see\nFigure 7).\nDisadvantage:\n\u2022 l) they have a small interaction cross section so their detection is problematic,\nrequiring very large volumes of matter.\n\n\f10\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\nFig. 6. The Cosmic neutrinos spectrum\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n11\n\nMany of the neutrinos spectral features have been measured (\u03bd from the\nsun, from SN 1987, from reactors, from the atmosphere), some may be on the\nverge of being seen as \u03bd's of galactic origin[28] while other are expected to exist\nbut are still undetected (relic neutrinos, neutrinos from AGN's). Some could\nbe produced by exotic sources, like superheavy particles or topological defects.\nThe interest of neutrinos is their capability to escape the GZK cutoff up to\nextreme energies: they are the only particle that can reach us from the edges of\nthe universe, carrying information about the status of space, time and matter,\nbefore the recombination took place (Figure 7).\nThe main difficulty for neutrino detection is related to the mass required for\ntheir detection. The only way to access energies of the order of 1014 eV or above\nis to use the earth surface layers as targets, like the atmosphere, ice or water.\nIn the case of the atmosphere the fluorescence light emitted by the developing\nshower could be detected from a space experiment able to monitor a sufficiently\nlarge area of our planet. This is the purpose or the EUSO[22] experiment on the\nInternational Space Station, expected to increase the sensitivity of the Auger\narray by more than an order of magnitude by the end of the decade.\n\nFig. 7. Energy dependence of GZK cutoff for different CR species[29]\n\n\f12\n\n5\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\nSearching for new particles\n\nIn this section now briefly discuss the physics potential of the accurate study of\nthe cosmic radiation. An area of clear interest for particle physics is obviously\nthe search of new states of matter or for new particles.\n\nFig. 8. Antimatter limits. For the references see [30]\n\n5.1\n\nDirect search for nuclear anti-matter\n\nThe disappearence of antimatter [31,32,33] is one of the most intriguing puzzles\nin our current understanding of the structure of the Universe. Absence of nuclear\nantimatter from the scale of our galaxy to the scale of the local supercluster is\nexperimentally established at the level of 1 part in 106 by direct CR searches\nand indirect methods like the study of the energy spectrum of the diffuse gamma\nray flux. For a genuine antimatter signal one should look to nuclei heavier that\np\u0304 since secondary p\u0304 can be easily produced at the level 10\u22124 in high energy\nhadronic interaction of CR with the IM. This probability quickly vanishes with\nincreasing atomic number. For D\u0304 the secondary production is at the level of\n \u0304 it is well below 10\u221212 .\n10\u22128 or less and already for 4 He\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n13\n\nFig. 9. Sensitivity to strangelets in AMS-02\n\n \u0304 at the level of one\nThis is why the unambiguous observation of a couple of 4 He\npart in a billion or more would have profound implications on our understanding\nof baryogenesis. During the last 35 years experiments on balloons have pushed\n \u0304 at the level of less than about one part in a million (Figure\nthe limit on the 4 He\n8). Recently the AMS-01 spectrometer, during a 10 days precursor flight on the\nShuttle, has reached the same level of sensitivity. In the coming years PAMELA,\nfirst, and AMS-02, later, will eventually reach a sensitivity a thousand time\nbetter, reaching rigidities of the order of a TV.\n5.2\n\nDirect search for strange states of matter\n\nStrangelets[34] are a stable state of nuclear matter containing a large fraction\nof strange quarks. Such states could have developed during the cosmological\nquark-hadron phase transition 10\u22125 s after the Big Bang or in the high density\nconditions of compact supernova remnants, which might then be strange stars\ncomposed of quark matter rather than neutron stars. These stars could send to\nspace fragments of stable strange nuclear matter during catastrophic events like\ncollisions with other strange stars. These fragment would have variable mass but\na peculiar charge to mass ratio. For instance in the case of color-flavor locked\nstrangelets we obtain a charge to mass relation of the type Z = 0.3A2/3 . These\nparticles would look like high mass, low mass/charge ratio cosmic rays which\ncould be easily identified in a space born magnetic spectrometer like AMS-02.\nFigure 9 shows the sensitivity to strangelets expected for AMS-02 after three\nyears on the International Space Station[35].\n\n\f14\n\n5.3\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\nIndirect search for Dark Matter\n\nThe presence at all scales in our universe of a non luminous components of\nmatter, Dark Matter (DM)[37,38], is possibly the most fascinating problem in\nAstro Particle physics. A viable solution, if not the most viable solution[36] to\nthis problem, is given by the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), the neutralino (\u03c7). Supersymmetry links the existing Standard Model particles to a set\nof new, heavier, super particles through R-parity conservation, where R is a combination of the particle spin, lepton and baryon numbers, R = (\u22121)3B\u2212L+2S .\nThe conservation of R-parity requires that the LSP is stable. LEP results suggests that the LSP is heavy (m\u03c7 > 45 GeV )[39] and then these particles can be\na good DM candidate in the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario.\nUnfortunately SUSY is a theory with many parameters still poorly constrained. The LSP (neutralino) can be expressed as superposition of the neutral\ngauge (g and W ) and Higgs boson superpartners (H01 , H02 ):\n\u03c7 = N11 B + N12 W3 + N13 H01 + N14 H02\n\n(1)\n\nThe parameters of this superposition define the \u03c7 properties, like the mass, the\nannihilation cross section and branching ratios into detectable particles. These\nparameters can also be related to the \u03c7 cosmological density, which can be\nconstrained in the interesting region 0.1 < \u03a9DM < 0.3, in agreement with the\nrecent astrophysical results[40].\n\u03c7 annihilation would take place in the most dense regions of our galaxy, e.g.\nits center or in other existing DM clumps. These regions could be the source of\nprompt high energy CR without need of an acceleration mechanism. In order\nto detect these prompt CR we study rare CR components where the effects of\nthe exotic \u03c7 contributions would be detectable against backgrounds due to the\nprimary spectrum. Rare CR components like high energy p\u0304[37], e+ [15], D\u0304[42]\nand \u03b3[43] have been suggested as potential indirect signatures for cold DM .\nIn Figure 5 we give an example of spectral distortions induced by \u03c7 annihilations on the e+ /(e+ + e\u2212 ) ratio. Quite interesting is the case of D\u0304 production,\nsince it has been suggested[42] that a D\u0304 signal at kinetic energies below \u223c 1 GeV\nwould be a strong indication for \u03c7 annihilation. In the case of high energy \u03b3 rays\nthe spectral deformation due to \u03c7 annihilation is expected to have a strong spatial dependence, mimicking the DM halo structure which might have more than\none clumps in our galaxy. For a subset of SUSY models this flux of HE \u03b3 rays\ncould be detectable by space born experiments (Figure 10).\nFor many SUSY models the indirect search for \u03c7 in CR will be a difficult\nundertaking: SUSY predictions depends in fact from several parameters and the\nlimited precision in the knowledge of CR composition and spectra will challenge\nthe unambiguous detection of a \u03c7 signal. Before the advent of the LHC, however,\nthe physics potential of SUSY searches in space is promising[41,39]. In fact most\nof the cosmologically relevant SUSY parameter space can be explored by CR\nexperiments. Capability to measure at the same time all type of charged and\nneutral particles which can be signature of \u03c7 annihilation would clearly be an\nexperimental advantage: starting from 2006, the AMS-02 experiment on the ISS\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n15\n\nFig. 10. Sensitivity to SUSY dark matter for various HE gamma ray experiment,\neither ground based (bottom right) or space based (top left). Vertical axis: gamma rays\nintegral flux above a the energy threshold Ethr . The dotted line represent the integral\nflux of HE gamma rays from known sources, which represent a source of background\nfor this measurement. The continuous line represent the prediction for a SUSY model,\nwith m\u03c7 = 120 GeV and a boost factor < J(0) >= 5000[41].\n\nwill be the only experiment able to precisely measure at the same time all kind of\nparticles related to \u03c7 decay. Other experiment will also contribute to this search:\nPAMELA will contribute by precisely measure the p\u0304 component, in particular\nat low energy, starting in 2003, while GLAST will perform the most precise\nmeasurement of the high energy \u03b3 ray halo structure and spectra starting in\n2007.\n5.4\n\nIndirect search for ultraheavy particles\n\nThe existence of a measurable flux of Extreme Energies Cosmic Rays above\n1019 eV , represents a big puzzle in modern Astro Particle physics. The behavior\nof the GKS cutoff versus energy and particle type shown in Figure 7 suggests\nthat no particle except the \u03bd's can travel for large distances at these energies.\nAbove 1019 eV the volume of the region which can be traversed by hadronic\nEECR is then dramatically reduced.\nOne would then expect a steeper spectrum above the GZK cutoff. The experimental results suggest instead a smoother spectrum which would not be possible\n\n\f16\n\nRoberto Battiston\n\nFig. 11. SUSY parameter space explored by passive experiments. Before the advent\nof LHC most of the cosmologically interesting parameter space will be explored by\nground based or space born experiment. Fore more details see [41]\n\nto explain using conventional physics. Although we are talking only about few\ndozen events collected by various experiments over several years, their existence\nchallenge standard explanations. One possible scenario is based on EE \u03bd emitted\nin the decay of extremely heavy particles present in the very early phases of the\nuniverse. These particle travel until they reach regions close to us where they\ndo interact with ordinary IS matter and produce EECR which in turn reach our\nplanet where they can be detected. During this decade the advent of space experiments like EUSO[22] and KLYPVE[23] will improve by one or two orders of\nmagnitude the sensitivity to EECR of the Auger experiment, hopefully clarifying\nthe present situation.\n\n\fAstro Particle Physics from Space\n\n6\n\n17\n\nConclusion\n\nOne hundred years after their discovery Cosmic Rays have still an important\npotential for new physics. In order to exploit this potential new, more sensitive\nexperiments are planned which can take advantage of the unique conditions of\nspace for precision measurement of the primary CR flux. During the current\ndecade these experiments might well deliver exciting surprises in Astro Particle\nphysics, on issues like antimatter, dark matter or other exotic states of matter.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been partially supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) under\ncontract ARS-98/47.\n\nReferences\n1.
