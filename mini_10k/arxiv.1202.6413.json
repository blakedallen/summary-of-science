We study pairs (C, D) of unital C \u2217 -algebras where D is an abelian C \u2217 -subalgebra of C\nwhich is regular in C in the sense that the span of {v \u2208 C : vDv \u2217 \u222a v \u2217 Dv \u2286 D} is dense in C.

We show\nthat the left kernel of E, L(C, D), is the unique closed two-sided ideal of C maximal with respect\nto having trivial intersection with D. When L(C, D) = 0, we show the MASA D norms C in the\nsense of Pop-Sinclair-Smith.

We characterize when the relative commutant Dc of D in C is abelian in terms of the dynamics of the action\nof \u0393 and show that when Dc is abelian, L(C, Dc ) = (0). This setting produces examples where no\nconditional expectation of C onto Dc exists.\nIn general, pure states of D do not extend uniquely to states on C.

An inclusion is a pair (C, D) of C \u2217 -algebras with D abelian, and D \u2286 C. When C\nhas a unit I, we always assume that I \u2208 D. For any inclusion, let\nN(C, D) := {v \u2208 C : v \u2217 Dv \u222a vDv \u2217 \u2286 D};\nelements of N(C, D) are called normalizers. If (Ci , Di ) (i = 1, 2) are inclusions, and \u03b8 : C1 \u2192 C2 is\na \u2217-homomorphism, we will say that \u03b8 is a regular \u2217-homomorphism if\n\u03b8(N(C1 , D1 )) \u2286 N(C2 , D2 ).\nWhen \u03b8 is regular and one-to-one, we will say that (C1 , D1 ) regularly embeds into (C2 , D2 ).\nThe inclusion (C, D) is a\nregular inclusion if span N(C, D) is norm-dense in C;\nMASA inclusion if D is a MASA in C;\nEP inclusion if D has the extension property relative to C, that is, every pure state \u03c3 on D\nhas a unique extension to a state on C and no pure state of C annihilates D;\nCartan inclusion if (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion and there exists a faithful conditional\nexpectation E : C \u2192 D;\nC \u2217 -diagonal if (C, D) is a Cartan inclusion and also an EP-inclusion.\nExamples of regular inclusions are commonplace in the theory of C \u2217 -algebras: any MASA D in\na finite dimensional C \u2217 -algebra C yields a C \u2217 -diagonal (C, D); the categogy of C \u2217 -diagonals and\nregular \u2217-monomorphisms is closed under inductive limits [10, Theorem 4.23]; when a discrete group\n\u0393 acts topologically freely on a compact Hausdorff space X, the reduced crossed product C(X)\u22car \u0393\ntogether with the canonical embedding of C(X) yields a Cartan pair (C(X) \u22car \u0393, C(X)) [31]; when\nC is the C \u2217 -algebra of a directed graph and D is the C \u2217 -subalgebra generated by the range and\nsource projections of the partial isometries corresponding to the edges of the graph, the pair (C, D)\nis a regular inclusion. Other examples arise from certain constructions in the theory of groupoid\nC \u2217 -algebras or from C \u2217 -algebras constructed from combinatoral data.\nIn this paper, we present a number of structural results for regular inclusions. Our main results\ninclude: Theorem 3.10, which establishes the existence and uniqueness of a psuedo-expectation\nfor a regular MASA inclusion; Theorem 3.22, which shows that the left kernel L(C, D)) of the\npseudo-expectation is a two-sided ideal in C which is maximal with respect to being diagaonal\ndisjoint; Theorem 5.9, which characterizes when a regular inclusion can be regularly embedded\ninto a C \u2217 -diagonal; Theorem 8.14 which shows how constructions of Kumjian and Renault may\nbe used to produce a twist associated to a regular inclusion; Theorem 9.2, which shows that for a\nregular MASA inclusion with L(C, D) = (0), D norms C in the sense of Pop-Sinclair-Smith; and\nTheorem 9.4, which gives conditions on which an isometric isomorphism of a subalgebra A of C\ncontaining D can be extended to a \u2217 isomorphism of the C \u2217 -algebra generated by A. We turn now\nto some background.\n2\n\n\fIn a landmark paper, J. Feldman and C. Moore [13] considered pairs (M, D) consisting of a\n(separably acting) von Neumann algebra M containing a MASA D \u2243 L\u221e (X, \u03bc) such that the set\nof normalizing unitaries, {u \u2208 M : u is unitary and uDu\u2217 = D}, has \u03c3-weakly dense span in M\nand there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation E : M \u2192 D. In this context, Feldman\nand Moore showed that there is a Borel equivalence relation R on X and a cocycle c such that\nthe pair (M, D) can be identified with a von-Neumann algebra arising from certain Borel functions\non R. In a heuristic sense, their construction may be viewed as the left regular representation of\nthe equivalence relation where the multiplication is twisted by the cocycle c. This result may be\nviewed as a means of coordinatizing the von Neumann algebra along D.\nWork on a C \u2217 -algebraic version of the Feldman-Moore result was studied by Kumjian in [22]. In\nthat article, Kumjian introduced the notion of a C \u2217 -diagonals as well as the notion of regularity.\n(We should mention that the axioms for a C \u2217 -diagonal given in [22], while equivalent to the axioms\ngiven in Definition 1.1, do not explicitly mention the extension property. In the sequel, we will\nhave considerable interest in the extension property or its failure, which is why we use the axioms\ngiven in Definition 1.1.) Kumjian showed that if (C, D) is a C \u2217 -diagonal, with C separable and D\u0302\nsecond countable, then it can be coordinatized via a twisted groupoid over a topological equivalence\nrelation. This provided a very satisfying parallel to the von Neumann algebraic context.\nThe requirement of the extension property in the axioms for a C \u2217 -diagonal is at times too\nstringent, which is one of the advantages to Cartan inclusions, which need not have the extension\nproperty. For example, let H = l2 (N), with the usual orthonormal basis {en }, and let S be the\nunilateral shift, Sen = en+1 . Let C := C \u2217 (S) be the Toeplitz algebra, and let D = C \u2217 ({S n S \u2217n : n \u2265\n0}). Routine arguments show this is a Cartan inclusion, but the state \u03c1\u221e (T ) = limn\u2192\u221e hT en , en i\non D fails to have a unique extension to a state on C,\nCartan inclusions were introduced by Renault in [31], where he showed that if (C, D) is a Cartan\ninclusion (again with the separability and second countability hypotheses), then there is a satisfactory coordinatization of the pair (C, D) via a twisted groupoid. In this paper, Renault makes\na very convincing case that Cartan inclusions are the appropriate analog of the Feldman-Moore\nsetting in the C \u2217 -context.\nLet (C, D) be an inclusion. A conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D gives a preferred class,\n{\u03c1 \u25e6 E : \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302}, of extensions of pure states on D to states on C, and when the expectation E is\nunique, this class may be used for construction of coordinates. Indeed, when (C, D) is a Cartan\ninclusion (or C \u2217 -diagonal), elements of the twisted groupoid arise from ordered pairs [v, \u03c1], where\nv \u2208 N(C, D) and \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 with \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0. Such a pair determines a linear functional of norm one on\nC by the rule,\n(1)\n\n[v, \u03c1](x) =\n\n\u03c1(E(v \u2217 x))\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)1/2\n\n(x \u2208 C).\n\nThe work of Feldman-Moore also makes essential use of conditional expectations.\nBy [2, Theorem 3.4], any EP inclusion (C, D) has a unique conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D.\nThus for a C \u2217 -diagonal, the extension property guarantees the the uniqueness of the expectation expectation E : C \u2192 D. Interestingly, the extension property is not necessary to guarantee uniqueness\nof expectations. Indeed, Renault showed that when (C, D) is a Cartan inclusion, with expectation\nE : C \u2192 D, then E is the unique conditional expectation of C onto D.\nWhat other regular inclusions (C, D) have unique expectations of C onto D? While we do\nnot know the answer to this question in general, we give a positive result along these lines in\nTheorem 2.10 below: this result shows that when (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion with D\nan injective C \u2217 -algebra, then (C, D) is an EP inclusion, and therefore has a unique expectation.\nSection 2 also contains results on dynamics of regular inclusions and introduces the notion of a\nquasi-free action. Theorem 2.9 characterizes the extension property for regular MASA inclusions in\n3\n\n\fterms of the dynamics of regular inclusions: the regular MASA inclusion (C, D) is an EP-inclusion\nif and only if the \u2217-semigroup N(C, D) acts quasi-freely on D\u0302.\nUnfortunately, conditional expectations do not always exist, even when (C, D) is a regular MASA\ninclusion, and the C \u2217 -algebras involved are well-behaved. Here is a simple example, which is a\nspecial case of the far more general setting considered in Section 6.\nExample 1.2. Let X be a connected, compact Hausdorff space, and let \u03b1 : X \u2192 X be a homeomorphism such that \u03b12 is the identity map on X. Let F \u25e6 be the interior of the set of fixed\npoints for \u03b1; we assume that F \u25e6 is neither empty nor all of X. (For a concrete example, take\nX = {z \u2208 C : |z| \u2264 1 and R(z) I(z) = 0} and let \u03b1(z) = z.)

Since\n0 1 \u2208 N(C, Dc ), it follows that (C, Dc ) is a regular MASA inclusion.\n10\nSuppose E : C \u2192 Dc is a conditional expectation.

This implies that F \u25e6 = \u2205, contrary to hypothesis. Hence no\nconditional expectation of C onto Dc exists.\nOne of the goals of this paper is to show that even though conditional expectations may fail to\nexist for a regular MASA inclusion, there is a map which which may be used as a replacement.\nHere is the relevant definition.\n\nDefinition 1.3. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and let (I(D), \u03b9) be an injective envelope for D. A\npseudo-conditional expectation for \u03b9, or more simply, a pseudo-expectation for \u03b9, is a unital completely positive map E : C \u2192 I(D) such that E|D = \u03b9. When the context is clear, we sometimes\ndrop the reference to \u03b9 and simply call E a pseudo-expectation.\nThe existence of pseudo-expectations follows immediately from the injectivity of I(D). In general,\nthe pseudo-expectation need not be unique.\nHowever, in Section 3 below, we show that for any regular MASA inclusion (C, D), there is always\na unique pseudo-expectation E : C \u2192 I(D), see Theorem 3.10. Let Mod(C, D) be the family of all\n4\n\n\f[\nstates on C which restrict to elements of D\u0302. The family of states, Ss (C, D) := {\u03c1 \u25e6 E : \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)}\ncovers D\u0302 in the sense that the restriction map, Ss (C, D) \u220b \u03c1 7\u2192 \u03c1|D \u2208 D\u0302, is onto. Interestingly,\nSs (C, D) is the unique minimal closed subset of Mod(C, D) which covers D\u0302, see Theorem 3.13. We\nalso show that Ss (C, D) is closely related to the extension property. When (C, D) is \"countably\ngenerated,\" Theorem 3.13 also shows that Ss (C, D) is the closure of all states in Mod(C, D) whose\nrestrictions to D extend uniquely to C.\nFor a regular MASA inclusion, the intersection of the left kernels of the states in Ss (C, D) is the\nleft kernel of the pseudo-expectation E. Let L(C, D) be the left kernel of E. Theorem 3.22 shows\nthat L(C, D) is an ideal of C, and moreover, is the unique ideal of C which is maximal with respect\nto the property of having trivial intersection with D. When the pseudo-expectation takes values in\nD (rather than I(D)), the ideal L(C, D) may be viewed as a measure of the failure of the inclusion\nto be Cartan in Renault's sense.\nWe define a regular MASA inclusion to be a virtual Cartan inclusion when the pseudo-expectation\nis faithful, or equivalently, when L(C, D) = 0. The purpose of Section 6 is to give a large class of\nvirtual Cartan inclusions. Theorem 6.9 shows that when C is the reduced crossed product of the\nabelian C \u2217 -algebra D by a discrete group \u0393, then, provided the relative commutant Dc of D in C\nis abelian, (C, Dc ) is a virtual Cartan inclusion. We characterize when Dc is abelian in terms of\nthe dynamics of the action of \u0393 on D\u0302 in Theorem 6.6; this result shows that Dc is abelian precisely\nwhen the germ isotropy subgroup H x of \u0393 is abelian for every x \u2208 D\u0302. The results of Section 6 are\nsummarized in Theorem 6.10.\nOne of the motivations for our study of inclusions was to provide a context for the study of\ncertain nonselfadjoint subalgebras. If (C, D) is a C \u2217 -diagonal, there are numerous papers devoted\nto the study of various (usually nonselfadjoint) closed algebras A with D \u2286 A \u2286 C, see [7, 9, 10, 21,\n23, 24, 25] to name just a few. An often successful strategy for the analysis of the subalgebras of\nC \u2217 -diagonals is to use the coordinatization of (C, D) (via the twist) to impose coordinates on the\nsubalgebras; properties of the coordinate system then reflect properties of the subalgebra.\nSince many classes of regular MASA inclusions are neither C \u2217 -diagonals nor Cartan inclusions, it\nis natural to wonder whether coordinate methods may be used to analyze nonselfadjoint subalgebras\nof regular MASA inclusions. A strategy for doing so is to try to regularly embed a given regular\nMASA inclusion (C, D) into a C \u2217 -diagonal (C1 , D1 ) and then to restrict the coordinates obtained\nfrom (C1 , D1 ) to the (C, D) or to the given subalgebra. This leads to the following problem.\nProblem 1.4. Characterize when a given regular inclusion (C, D) can be regularly embedded into\na C \u2217 -diagonal.\nWe give a solution to Problem 1.4 in Section 5. To do this, we introduce a new family S(C, D) \u2286\nMod(C, D), which we call compatible states. When (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, Ss (C, D) \u2286\nS(C, D). The intersection of the left kernels of the states in S(C, D) is an ideal of C, Rad(C, D).\nThe regular inclusion (C, D) regularly embeds in a C \u2217 -diagonal if and only if Rad(C, D) = (0), see\nTheorem 5.9. In particular, any virtual Cartan inclusion regularly embeds into a C \u2217 -diagonal.\nThe needed properties of compatible states are developed in Section 4. Compatible states can be\ndefined for any inclusion, and we expect that they may be useful in other contexts as well. While\ncompatible states exist in abundance for any regular MASA inclusion, Theorem 4.8 implies that\ncompatible states need not exist for a general regular inclusion.\nFor a regular MASA inclusion (C, D), it is always the case that Rad(C, D) \u2286 L(C, D). We have\nbeen unable to resolve the question of whether equality holds. We provide some insight into this\nquestion in Section 7. Given \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, there is an equivalence relation R1 on H\u03c3 := {v \u2208 N(C, D) :\n\u03c1(v \u2217 dv) = \u03c1(d) for all d \u2208 D}, and the set H\u03c3 /R1 of equivalence classes of this equivalence relation\nmay be made into a T-group. The main result of this section, Theorem 7.13, shows that there\n5\n\n\fis a bijective correspondence between {\u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) : \u03c1|D = \u03c3} and a certain family of prehomomorphisms on H\u03c3 /R1 . Theorem 7.13 thus gives a description of a certain class of state\nextensions of \u03c3. Our description leads us to suspect that it is possible for Rad(C, D) to be a proper\nsubset of L(C, D).\nThe purpose of Section 8 is to discuss certain twisted groupoids arising from a regular MASA\ninclusion. The methods of this section are suitable modifications to our context of the methods used\nby Kumjian and Renault when coordinatizing C \u2217 -diagonals and Cartan inclusions. We show that\ngiven any regular MASA inclusion (C, D), there is a twist associated to (C, D). We use Ss (C, D)\nor another suitable subset F of S(C, D) as unit space of the twist, and define functionals [v, \u03c1] on\nC much as in equation (1), except that the functional \u03c1 \u25e6 E appearing in that formula is replaced\nwith an element of F . The main result of this section, Theorem 8.14, shows that when Rad(C, D)\nis trivial, there is a regular \u2217-monomorphism of (C, D) into the Cartan inclusion arising from the\ntwist associated to (C, D). This result gives perspective to the embedding results of Section 5, and\nsuggests that it is indeed possible to coordinatize subalgebras using this twist, as indicated prior\nto Problem 1.4.\nIn [28], we gave a method for extending an isometric isomorphism between subalgebras Ai of\nC \u2217 -diagonals (Ci , Di ) with Di \u2286 Ai \u2286 Ci to a \u2217-isomorphism of the C \u2217 -subalgebra C \u2217 (A1 ) of C1\ngenerated by A1 onto the corresponding subalgebra C \u2217 (A2 ). The two main ingredients of this\nmethod were: a) show that Di norms Ci in the sense of Pop-Sinclair-Smith ([29]), and b) show\nthat the C \u2217 -envelope of Ai is isometrically isomorphic to C \u2217 (Ai ). In Section 9, we show that if\nthe hypothesis that (Ci , Di ) is weakened from C \u2217 -diagonal to virtual Cartan inclusion, then both\nthese ingredients still hold. Theorem 9.4 generalizes [28, Theorem 2.16] to the context of virtual\nCartan inclusions. This is a considerable generalization, and allows for the simplification of some\narguments in the literature.\nThe author is indebted to William Arveson, who greatly influenced the author and the field of\noperator algebras. His passing saddens us all.\nWe thank Ken Davidson, Allan Donsig, William Grilliette, Vern Paulsen, and Vrej Zarikian for\nseveral very helpful conversations.\n1.1. Preliminaries. Given a Banach space X, we will use X# instead of the traditional X\u2217 to\ndenote the Banach space dual. Likewise if \u03b1 : X \u2192 Y is a bounded linear map between Banach\nspaces, we use \u03b1# to denote the adjoint map, f \u2208 Y# 7\u2192 f \u25e6 \u03b1 \u2208 X# .\nIf X is a topological space and E \u2286 X, E \u25e6 denotes the interior of E. Also, for f : X \u2192 C, we\nwrite supp f for the set {x \u2208 X : f (x) 6= 0}.\nStanding Assumption 1.5. For the remainder of this paper, all C \u2217 -algebras will be unital, and\nif D is a sub-C \u2217 -algebra of the C \u2217 -algebra C, we assume that the unit for D is the same as the unit\nfor C.\nLet C be a C \u2217 -algebra, and let S(C) be the state space of C. For \u03c1 \u2208 S(C) let L\u03c1 = {x \u2208 C :\n\u03c1(x\u2217 x) = 0} be the left kernel of \u03c1, and let (\u03c0\u03c1 , H\u03c1 , \u03be) be the GNS representation corresponding to\n\u03c1. We regard C/L\u03c1 as a dense subset of H\u03c1 , and for x \u2208 C will often write x + L\u03c1 to denote the\nvector \u03c0\u03c1 (x)\u03be. Denote the inner product on H\u03c1 by h*, *i\u03c1 .\nWe now recall some facts about projective topological spaces, projective covers, and injective\nenvelopes of abelian C \u2217 -algebras. Following [17], given a compact Hausdorff space X, a pair (P, f )\nconsisting of a compact Hausdorff space P and a continuous map f : P \u2192 X is called a cover\nfor X (or simply a cover ) if f is surjective. A cover (P, f ) is rigid if the only continuous map\nh : P \u2192 P which satisfies f \u25e6 h = f is h = idP ; the cover (P, f ) is essential if whenever Y is a\ncompact Hausdorff space and h : Y \u2192 P is continuous and satisfies f \u25e6 h is onto, then h is onto.\nA compact Hausdorff space P is projective if whenever X and Y are compact Hausdorff spaces\nand h : Y \u2192 X and f : P \u2192 X are continuous maps with h surjective, there exists a continuous\n6\n\n\fmap g : P \u2192 Y with g \u25e6 h = f . A Hausdorff space which is extremally disconnected (i.e. the closure\nof every open set is open) and compact is Stonean. In [15, Theorem 2.5], Gleason proved that a\ncompact Hausdorff space P is projective if and only P is Stonean.\nBy [17, Proposition 2.13], if (P, f ) is a cover for X with P a projective space, then (P, f ) is rigid\nif and only if (P, f ) is essential. A projective cover for X is a rigid cover (P, f ) for X such that P\nis projective. A projective cover for X always exists [17, Theorem 2.16] and is unique in the sense\nthat if (P1 , f1 ) and (P2 , f2 ) are projective covers for X, then there is a unique homeomorphism\nh : P1 \u2192 P2 such that f1 = f2 \u25e6 h.\nThe concept of an injective envelope for an abelian unital C \u2217 -algebras is dual to the concept of\na projective cover of a compact Hausdorff space: if (P, f ) is a cover for X, let \u03b9 : C(X) \u2192 C(P ) be\nthe map d 7\u2192 d \u25e6 f ; then (P, f ) is a projective cover if and only if (C(P ), \u03b9) is an injective, envelope\nof C(X) [17, Corollary 2.18]. (Injective envelopes can be also be defined for general unital C \u2217 algebras, not just abelian, unital C \u2217 -algebras. Like projective covers, injective envelopes of unital\nC \u2217 -algebras have a uniqueness property. If A is a unital C \u2217 -algebra, and (B1 , \u03c31 ) and (B2 , \u03c32 )\nare injective envelopes for A, then there exists a unique \u2217-isomorphism \u03b8 : B1 \u2192 B2 such that\n\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c31 = \u03c32 [18, Theorem 4.1].)\nRecall that a unital C \u2217 -algebra C is monotone complete if every bounded increasing net in the\nself-adjoint part, Cs.a. , of C has a least upper bound in Cs.a. . Hamana [20] shows that every injective\nC \u2217 -algebra is monotone complete. When (x\u03bb ) is a bounded increasing net in Cs.a. , supC x\u03bb means\nthe least upper bound of (x\u03bb ) in C.\nTheorem 6.6 of [20] implies that if A is a unital, abelian C \u2217 -algebra then any injective envelope\n(B, \u03c3) for A is Hamana-regular in the sense that whenever x \u2208 B is self-adjoint, x = supB {\u03c3(a) :\na \u2208 A, a = a\u2217 and a \u2264 x}. (Since A is abelian, we regard {\u03c3(a) : a \u2208 A, a = a\u2217 and a \u2264 x}\nas a net indexed by itself.) As Hamana observes in [20], when x \u2208 A is positive, then also,\nx = supB {\u03c3(a) : a \u2208 A and 0 \u2264 \u03c3(a) \u2264 b}.\nHere is a description of an injective envelope of an abelian C \u2217 -algebra. For details, see [16,\nTheorem 1]. Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Define an equivalence relation on the algebra\nB(X) of all bounded Borel complex-valued functions on X by f \u223c g if and only if {x \u2208 X :\nf (x) \u2212 g(x) 6= 0} is a set of first category. The equivalence class J of the zero function is an ideal in\nB(X) and the quotient D(X) := B(X)/J is called the Dixmier algebra. Define j : C(X) \u2192 D(X)\nby j(f ) = f + J. Then (D(X), j) is an injective envelope for D.\nWe conclude this section with a few comments regarding categories. Let C be the category of\nunital abelian C \u2217 -algebras with \u2217-homomorphisms, and let O be the category of operator systems\nwith completely positive (unital) maps. Let D be a unital abelian C \u2217 -algebra. Then D is an injective\nobject in C if and only if D is an injective object in O, see [17, Theorem 2.4]. (The statement of [17,\nTheorem 2.4], mentions the category of operator systems without explicitly giving the morphisms,\nbut the proof makes it clear that the authors mean the category of operator systems and unital,\ncompletely positive maps.)\nHamana shows that in the category O, there is an injective object I(D) and a one-to-one completely positive \u03b9 : D \u2192 I(D) such that the extension (I(D), \u03b9) is rigid and essential. Hamana and\nHadwin-Paulsen (see [19] and [17, Corollary 2.18]) observe that I(D) is endowed with a product\nwhich makes it into an abelian C \u2217 -algebra (and \u03b9 a \u2217-monomorphism). Set X = D\u0302, and let (P, f )\nbe a projective cover for X, so that the map \u03c4 : D \u2192 C(P ) given by \u03c4 (x) = x\u0302 \u25e6 f is a one-to-one\n\u2217-homomorphism of D into C(P ). Corollary 2.18 of [17] also shows the existence of a \u2217-isomorphism\n\u03b8 : C(P ) \u2192 I(D) such that \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c4 = \u03b9.\nThus, for us an injective envelope (I(D), \u03b9) for D will be a rigid and essential extension of D in\nthe category C. The comments above show that this is equivalent to saying that (I(D), \u03b9) is a rigid\nand essential extension for D in O.\n7\n\n\f2. Dynamics of Regular Inclusions\nGiven a regular inclusion (C, D), the \u2217-semigroup N(C, D) of normalizers acts via partial homeomorphisms on the maximal ideal space D\u0302 of D. The purpose of this section is to discuss some\nof the features of this action. The first subsection is devoted to notation and some background\nfacts regarding normalizers and intertwiners. The second subsection gives a characterization of the\nextension property in terms of the dynamics associated with the action of N(C, D) on D\u0302 (Theorem 2.9). An interesting consequence is that for any regular MASA inclusion (C, D) with D injective\nis an EP inclusion, see Theorem 2.10.\n2.1. Normalizers and Intertwiners. Let (C, D) be an inclusion. Closely related to normalizers\nare intertwiners.\nDefinition 2.1. An intertwiner for D is an element v \u2208 C such that vD = Dv. We denote the set\nof all intertwiners by I(C, D).\nProposition 3.3 of [10] shows that for any intertwiner v, the elements v \u2217 v and vv \u2217 belong to the\nrelative commutant Dc of D in C. When v is a normalizer, the fact that D is unital shows that\nboth v \u2217 v and vv \u2217 belong to D, and it is easy to see that {v \u2208 I(C, D) : v \u2217 v, vv \u2217 \u2208 D} \u2286 N(C, D).\nIn general however, there exists v \u2208 I(C, D) with {v \u2217 v, vv \u2217 } 6\u2286 D. (For a simple example, observe\nthat every operator in M2 (C) is an intertwiner for the inclusion, (M2 (C), CI2 ).) Also, by [10,\nProposition 3.4], N(C, D) \u2286 I(C, D). However, the final paragraph of the proof of [10, Proposition 3.4], shows somewhat more than this, namely that {v \u2208 I(C, D) : v \u2217 v, vv \u2217 \u2208 D} = N(C, D).\nSummarizing, we have the following result.\nProposition 2.2 ([10, Propositions 3.3 and 3.4]). Let (C, D) be an inclusion. Then\n{v \u2208 I(C, D) : v \u2217 v, vv \u2217 \u2208 D} = N(C, D) \u2286 I(C, D).\nFurthermore, when D is a MASA in C, N(C, D) = I(C, D).\nThe following example of a regular homomorphism will be useful in the sequel.\nLemma 2.3. Suppose (C, D) is an inclusion such that the relative commutant, Dc , of D in C is\nabelian. Then (C, Dc ) is a MASA inclusion and N(C, D) \u2286 N(C, Dc ); in particular the identity map\nid : (C, D) \u2192 (C, Dc ) is a regular \u2217-homomorphism.\nProof. Since D and Dc are abelian, (C, Dc ) is a MASA inclusion.\nTo show that N(C, D) \u2286 N(C, Dc ), suppose v \u2208 I(C, D). Fix h \u2208 Dc , and let d \u2208 D be selfadjoint. Since v is a D-intertwiner, we may find a self-adjoint d\u2032 \u2208 D so that dv = vd\u2032 . Then\nd(vhv \u2217 ) = vd\u2032 hv \u2217 = vhd\u2032 v \u2217 = (vhv \u2217 )d, from which it follows that vhv \u2217 \u2208 Dc . Similarly, v \u2217 hv \u2208 Dc .\nWe conclude that I(C, D) \u2286 N(C, Dc ). Since N(C, Dc ) is norm-closed, Proposition 2.2 yields,\nN(C, D) \u2286 I(C, D) \u2286 N(C, Dc ).\nThus, (C, Dc ) is a MASA inclusion and the identity mapping id : (C, D) \u2192 (C, Dc ) is a regular\n\u2217-homomorphism.\n\u0003\nFor any topological space X, a partial homeomorphism is a homeomorphism h : S \u2192 R, where\nS and R are open subsets of X. As usual, dom(h) and ran(h) will denote the domain and range\nof the partial homeomorphism h. We use InvO (X) to denote the inverse semigroup of all partial\nhomeomorphisms of X. When S is a \u2217-semigroup, a semigroup homomorphism \u03b1 : S \u2192 InvO (X)\nis a \u2217-homomorphism if for every s \u2208 S, \u03b1(s\u2217 ) = \u03b1(s)\u22121 . A subset G of InvO (X) which is closed\nunder composition and inverses (i.e. a sub inverse semigroup) is called a pseudo-group on X.\nAssociated to any pseudo-group G on X is the groupoid of germs which is the set of equivalence\nclasses, {[x, \u03c6, y] : \u03c6 \u2208 G, y \u2208 dom(\u03c6), x = \u03c6(y)}, where [x, \u03c6, y] = [x1 , \u03c61 , y1 ] if and only y = y1\n8\n\n\fand there exists a neighborhood N of y such that \u03c6|N = \u03c61 |N . Elements [w, \u03c6, x] and [y, \u03c8, z] are\ncomposable if x = y and then [w, \u03c6, x] [y, \u03c8, z] = [w, \u03c6\u03c8, z] and [x, \u03c6, y]\u22121 = [y, \u03c6\u22121 , x]. The range\nand source maps are r([x, \u03c6, y]) = x and s([x, \u03c6, y]) = y. Thus X may be identified with the unit\nspace of the groupoid of germs.\nRecall (see [22, Proposition 6]) that a normalizer v determines a partial homeomorphism\n\u03b2v : {\u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c1(v \u2217 v) > 0} \u2192 {\u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c1(vv \u2217 ) > 0}\n\ngiven by\n\n\u03b2v (\u03c1)(d) =\n\n\u03c1(v \u2217 dv)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\n\n(d \u2208 D).\n\nClearly N(C, D) and I(C, D) are \u2217-semigroups under multiplication. Routine, but tedious, calculations show that the map N(C, D) \u220b v 7\u2192 \u03b2v is a \u2217-semigroup homomorphism \u03b2 : N(C, D) \u2192 InvO (D\u0302).\nWe record this fact as a proposition.\nProposition 2.4 ([31, Lemma 4.10]). Suppose (C, D) is an inclusion. Then the following statements hold.\n(1) Suppose that v, w \u2208 N(C, D) and \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 satisfies \u03c1(w\u2217 v \u2217 vw) 6= 0. Then \u03c1(w\u2217 w) 6= 0, and\n\u03b2vw (\u03c1) = \u03b2v (\u03b2w (\u03c1)).\n(2) For every v \u2208 N(C, D), \u03b2v\u2217 = (\u03b2v )\u22121 .\nFollowing Renault [31] we will call the collection,\nPG(C, D) := {\u03b2v : v \u2208 N(C, D)}\nthe Weyl pseudo-group of the inclusion. Also, the groupoid of germs of PG(C, D) is the Weyl\ngroupoid of the inclusion, which we denote by WG(C, D).\nRemarks 2.5.\n(1) Observe that if \u03b8 is a regular homomorphism, then \u03b8(D1 ) \u2286 D2 : indeed, for d \u2208 D1\nwith d \u2265 0, d1/2 \u2208 N(C1 , D1 ) and so \u03b8(d) = \u03b8(d1/2 )1\u03b8(d1/2 ) \u2208 D2 . It follows that the\ndynamics of inclusions under regular homomorphisms are well-behaved in the sense that if\n\u03b8 : (C1 , D1 ) \u2192 (C2 , D2 ) is a regular homomorphism of the inclusions (Ci , Di ), then whenever\nv \u2208 N(C1 , D1 ) \\ ker \u03b8, the following diagram commutes:\nD\u03022 \u2287 dom(\u03b2\u03b8(v) )\n\n\u03b2\u03b8(v)\n\n/ range(\u03b2\u03b8(v) ) \u2286 D\u03022\n\u03b8#\n\n\u03b8#\n\n\u000f\n\nD\u03021 \u2287 dom(\u03b2v )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03b2v\n\n/ range(\u03b2v ) \u2286 D\u03021 .\n\n(2) For some purposes, it is easier to work with intertwiners than normalizers. Thus, one might\nbe tempted to define a regular homomorphism using intertwiners instead of normalizers,\nthat is, by mandating \u03b8(I(C1 , D1 )) \u2286 I(C2 , D2 ). However, a disadvantage of doing so is that\nsuch a \u03b8 need not carry D1 into D2 , which is why we use N(C, D) rather than I(C, D) in\nDefinition 1.1. For an example of this, let C = C([0, 1]) and let D = {f \u2208 C([0, 1]) : f (0) =\nf (1/2)}. Then C = I(C, D), and since every unitary in C normalizes D, we see that (C, D)\nis regular (as in Definition 1.1). Taking (Ci , Di ) = (C, D), then any automorphism \u03b8 of C\nsatisfies \u03b8(I(C1 , D1 )) \u2286 I(C2 , D2 ), yet clearly one may choose \u03b8 so that \u03b8(D1 ) 6\u2286 \u03b8(D2 ).\n2.2. Quasi-Freeness and the Extension Property. By Proposition 2.4, S := {\u03b2v : v \u2208\nN(C, D)} is an inverse semigroup of partial homeomorphisms of D\u0302. Recall that a group G of\nhomeomorphisms of a space X acts freely if whenever g \u2208 G has a fixed point, then g is the\nidentity. Paralleling the notion for groups, we make the following definition.\n9\n\n\fDefinition 2.6. Suppose that S is a \u2217-semigroup and X is a compact Hausdorff space, and that\n\u03b1 : S \u2192 InvO (X) is a \u2217-semigroup homomorphism. We say that S acts quasi-freely on X if whenever\ns \u2208 S, {x \u2208 dom(\u03b1(s)) : \u03b1(s)(x) = x} is an open set in X.\nWhen \u0393 is a group acting quasi-freely on X, this says that for each s \u2208 \u0393, the set of fixed points\nof \u03b1(s) is a clopen set; in particular, when X is a connected set, the notions of free and quasi-free\nactions for a group (acting as homeomorphisms) on X coincide.\nIn some circumstance, quasi-freeness is automatic. Recall that a Hausdorff topological space X\nis extremally disconnected if the closure of every open subset of X is open and that X is a Stonean\nspace if X is compact, Hausdorff, and extremally disconnected. We shall show that if a \u2217-semigroup\nacts on a Stonean space, then it acts quasi-freely. To do this we require the following topological\nproposition. The proof is a straightforward adaptation of the elegant proof by Arhangel\u2032 skii of\nFrol\u0131\u0301k's Theorem [14, Theorem 3.1] on fixed points of homeomorphisms of extremally disconnected\nspaces. We provide a sketch of the proof for the convenience of the reader.\nProposition 2.7 (Frol\u0131\u0301k's Theorem). Let X be an extremally disconnected space, let V, W be clopen\nsubsets of X, and suppose h : V \u2192 W is a homeomorphism of V onto W . Then the set of fixed\npoints F := {x \u2208 V : h(x) = x} is a clopen subset of X. Moreover, there are three disjoint clopen\nsubsets C1 , C2 , C3 of X such that for i = 1, 2, 3, h(Ci ) \u2229 Ci = \u2205 = Ci \u2229 F and V = F \u222a C1 \u222a C2 \u222a C3 .\nProof (see [4, Theorem 1]). Call an open subset A \u2286 V h-simple if h(A) \u2229 A = \u2205. By\nS the Hausdorff\nmaximality theorem, there exists a maximal chain G of h-simple sets. Put U = G. Then U is\nalso a h-simple subset of V , and since U is open, maximality shows that U is in fact clopen.\nNext observe that h(U ) \u2229 V and h\u22121 (U \u2229 W ) are clopen h-simple sets, and put\nM = U \u222a (h(U ) \u2229 V ) \u222a h\u22121 (U \u2229 W ).\nSince the intersection of F with any h-simple subset of V is empty, we have M \u2229 F = \u2205. We shall\nshow that F = V \\ M .\nSuppose to the contrary, that x \u2208 V \\ M satisfies h(x) 6= x. Let H be an open subset of V such\nthat x \u2208 H and H \u2229 M and h(H) \u2229 H are both empty. Then H is h-simple and\n(2)\n\nH \u2229 U = H \u2229 (h(U ) \u2229 V ) = H \u2229 h\u22121 (U \u2229 W ) = \u2205.\n\nBut (2) implies that H \u222aU is a h-simple set which properly contains U , contradicting the maximality\nof U . So F = V \\ M .\nSince both V and M are clopen, so is F . Finally, to complete the proof, take C1 := U , C2 :=\nh(U ) \u2229 V, and C3 := h\u22121 (U \u2229 W ) \\ (h(U ) \u2229 V ).\n\u0003\nWith this preparation, we now show that any action of a \u2217-semigroup on a Stonean space is\nquasi-free.\nTheorem 2.8. Suppose that X is a Stonean space, S is a \u2217-semigroup, and \u03b1 : S \u2192 InvO (X) is a\n\u2217-semigroup homomorphism. Then S acts quasi-freely on X.\nProof. Fix s \u2208 S, and consider the open sets G := dom(\u03b1(s)) and H := ran(\u03b1(s)). Since X is compact and extremally disconnected, the Stone-\u010cech compactifications \u03b2G and \u03b2H are homeomorphic\nto G and H respectively ([34, Exercises 15G(1) and 19G(2)]). Since \u03b1(s) is a homeomorphism of\nG onto H, general properties of the Stone-\u010cech compactification show that \u03b1(s) extends to a\nhomeomorphism h of G onto H.\nLet F \u2286 G be the set of fixed points for h; Proposition 2.7 shows that F is clopen in X. Therefore,\n{x \u2208 dom(\u03b1(s)) : \u03b1(s)(x) = x} = F \u2229 dom(\u03b1(s))\nis open in X. Thus S acts quasi-freely on X.\n\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fQuasi-freeness is intimately related to the extension property. The following result is known in the\ncase when (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion with faithful expectation, see [31, Proposition 5.11].\nParts of the proof below follow the proof of [10, Proposition 3.12], but we reproduce it here for\nconvenience of the reader.\nTheorem 2.9. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion. Then the following statements are equivalent:\na) D has the extension property in C;\nb) D is a MASA in C and the action v 7\u2192 \u03b2v of the semigroup N(C, D) is a quasi-free action\non D\u0302;\nc) D is a MASA in C and for each \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, the isotropy group of WG(C, D) at \u03c3 is the trivial\ngroup.\nProof. (a)\u21d2(b). Suppose that D has the extension property. Then [3, Corollary 2.7] shows that\nD is a MASA in C, and that there exists a conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D. Suppose that\nv \u2208 N(C, D), and \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 satisfies \u03c3(v \u2217 v) > 0 and \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3. By [10, Proposition 3.12], we have\nv \u2217 E(v) \u2208 D. Also, if G is the unitary group of D, we have for g \u2208 G,\n\u03c3(v \u2217 gvg \u22121 ) = \u03c3(v \u2217 gv)\u03c3(g \u22121 ) = \u03b2v (\u03c3)(g)\u03c3(v \u2217 v)\u03c3(g \u22121 ) = \u03c3(g)\u03c3(v \u2217 v)\u03c3(g \u22121 ) = \u03c3(v \u2217 v).\nThe extension property and [3, Theorem 3.7] show that E(v) \u2208 co{gvg \u22121 : g \u2208 G}, so that\n\u03c3(v \u2217 E(v)) = \u03c3(v \u2217 v),\nwhence \u03c3(v \u2217 E(v)) = \u03c3(v \u2217 v) 6= 0.\nHence there exists an open set U \u2286 D\u0302 so that \u03c3 \u2208 U and \u03c4 (v \u2217 E(v)) 6= 0 for every \u03c4 \u2208 U . Since\n\u2217\nv E(v) \u2208 D, we have \u03c4 = \u03b2v\u2217 E(v) (\u03c4 ) = \u03b2v\u2217 (\u03b2E(v) (\u03c4 )) = \u03b2v\u2217 (\u03c4 ) for every \u03c4 \u2208 U . But \u03b2v\u22121 = \u03b2v\u2217 , so\n\u03b2v (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 for \u03c4 \u2208 U . Thus {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3(v \u2217 v) > 0 and \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3} is open in D\u0302, so the semigroup\n{\u03b2v : v \u2208 N(C, D)} acts quasi-freely on D\u0302.\nBefore proving (b)\u21d2(a), we establish some notation. We use [C, D] for the set {cd \u2212 dc : d \u2208\nD, c \u2208 C}. Also, a normalizer v \u2208 N(C, D) is a free normalizer if v 2 = 0. Kumjian notes in [22],\nthat any free normalizer belongs to span[C, D], because v(v \u2217 v)1/n \u2212 (v \u2217 v)1/n v = v(v \u2217 v)1/n \u2192 v.\nWe turn now to the proof of (b)\u21d2(a). So assume that (b) holds. We shall prove that\nN(C, D) \u2286 D + span[C, D].\n\n(3)\n\nOnce this inclusion is established, an application of [3, Theorem 2.4] will show that whenever \u03c11\nand \u03c12 are states of C with \u03c11 |D = \u03c12 |D \u2208 D\u0302, then for every v \u2208 N(C, D), \u03c11 (v) = \u03c12 (v). Regularity\nof (C, D) then implies that \u03c11 = \u03c12 , so that D has the extension property.\nTo show (3), fix v \u2208 N(C, D). Let F = {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3(v \u2217 v) > 0 and \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3}. By hypothesis, F\nis an open subset of D\u0302. Let \u03b5 > 0, and let\nX\u03b5 := F \u2229 {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3(v \u2217 v) \u2265 \u03b52 }.\nThen X\u03b5 is a closed subset of D\u0302. Let f\u03b5 \u2208 D be such that 0 \u2264 f\u03b5 \u2264 I, f\u02c6\u03b5 |X\u03b5 \u2261 1 and supp(f\u02c6\u03b5 ) \u2286 F .\nNext let\nY\u03b5 := F c \u2229 {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3(v \u2217 v) \u2265 \u03b52 }.\nClearly Y\u03b5 \u2229 supp(f\u02c6\u03b5 ) = \u2205.\n\u02c6 \u2229\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 Y\u03b5 , we have \u03b2v (\u03c3) 6= \u03c3, so we may find d \u2208 D with \u03c3(d) = 1, 0 \u2264 d \u2264 1, supp(d)\nsupp(f\u02c6\u03b5 ) = \u2205 and (vd)2 = 0. Compactness of Y\u03b5 and a partition of unity argument\nshow that there\nP\nexists n \u2208 N and a collection of functions {gj }nj=1 \u2286 D such that, with g\u03b5 = nj=1 gj , we have:\n(vgj )2 = 0,\n\n0 \u2264 gj \u2264 I,\n\nsupp(\u011dj ) \u2229 supp(f\u02c6\u03b5 ) = \u2205,\n11\n\n0 \u2264 g\u03b5 \u2264 I,\n\nand \u011d\u03b5 |Y\u03b5 \u2261 1.\n\n\fThen g\u03b5 f\u03b5 = 0, and kv(I \u2212 (f\u03b5 + g\u03b5 ))k < \u03b5. So v = lim\u03b5\u21920 (vf\u03b5 + vg\u03b5 ). From Kumjian's observation, vg\u03b5 \u2208 span[C, D]. Moreover, since the closed support of f\u02c6\u03b5 is contained in F , we find that vf\u03b5\ncommutes with D. Hence vf\u03b5 \u2208 D, as D is a MASA in C.\nLet \u03b5n be a sequence of positive numbers decreasing to 0. We may choose elements f\u03b5n \u2208 D as\nabove but with the additional condition that f\u03b5m \u2264 f\u03b5n whenever m < n. For n > m and \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302,\nwe have\n(\n0\nif \u03c3(f\u03b5n \u2212 f\u03b5m ) = 0\n\u2217\n2\n(4)\n\u03c3(v v(f\u03b5n \u2212 f\u03b5m ) ) =\n\u2217\n2\n\u03c3(v v)\u03c3(f\u03b5n \u2212 f\u03b5m ) if \u03c3(f\u03b5n \u2212 f\u03b5m ) 6= 0.\n\u2217 v, given \u03b4 > 0, there exists a open\nNotice that if \u03c3 \u2208 F \u2229 F c , then \u03c3(v \u2217 v) = 0. By continuity of vd\nc\n\u2217\nset U \u2286 D\u0302 with U \u2287 F \u2229 F and \u03c3(v v) < \u03b4 if \u03c3 \u2208 U . Since supp(f\u03b5n \u2212 f\u03b5m ) \u2286 U when n, m are\nsufficiently large, it follows from (4) that vf\u03b5n is a Cauchy sequence in D, and hence converges to\nk \u2208 D. Then\nv \u2212 k = lim (vg\u03b5n ) \u2208 span[C, D],\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhence v = k + (v \u2212 k) \u2208 D + span[C, D]. As noted above, this is sufficient to complete the proof\nthat D has the extension property. Thus (a) holds.\n(b)\u21d2(c). Fix \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, and suppose that [\u03c3, \u03c6, \u03c3] belongs to the isotropy group of WG(C, D) at \u03c3.\nThen there is an open set N and v \u2208 N(C, D) such that with \u03c3 \u2208 N \u2286 dom \u03c6 \u2229 dom \u03b2v such that\n\u03b2v |N = \u03c6|N . By quasi-freeness of the action, there exists a neighborhood N1 of \u03c3 contained in N\nsuch that \u03b2v |N1 = id|N1 . Thus, [\u03c3, \u03c6, \u03c3] = [\u03c3, id, \u03c3] so that the isotropy group of WG(C, D) at \u03c3 is\ntrivial.\n(c)\u21d2(b). Let v \u2208 N(C, D) and suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 dom(\u03b2v ) is a fixed point for \u03b2v . Then [\u03c3, \u03b2v , \u03c3] is\nin the isotropy group for WG(C, D) at \u03c3, so that [\u03c3, \u03b2v , \u03c3] = [\u03c3, id, \u03c3]. By the definition of the Weyl\ngroupoid, \u03c3 belongs to the interior of {x \u2208 dom(\u03b2v ) : \u03b2v (x) = x}. Hence {x \u2208 dom(\u03b2v ) : \u03b2v (x) = x}\nis an open set in X. As this holds for every v \u2208 N(C, D), the action v 7\u2192 \u03b2v is quasi-free.\n\u0003\nAs an immediate corollary of our work, we have the following.\nTheorem 2.10. Suppose (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, with D an injective C \u2217 -algebra.\nThen (C, D) has the extension property.\nProof. Results of Dixmier and Gonshor [8, 16] show that D is injective if and only if D\u0302 is a compact\nextremally disconnected space. Now combine Theorems 2.8 with the equivalence of (a) and (b) in\nTheorem 2.9.\n\u0003\nExample 2.11. Suppose that M is a von Neumann algebra and D \u2286 M is a MASA. Let C be the\nnorm-closure of N(M, D). Then (C, D) has the extension property. Note that in particular, when\nD is a Cartan MASA in M in the sense of Feldman and Moore [13], then (C, D) is a C \u2217 -diagonal.\nRemark 2.12. The regularity hypothesis in Theorem 2.10 cannot be removed. Indeed, [1, Corollary 4.7] shows that when C is the hyperfinite II1 factor, and D \u2286 C is any MASA, then (C, D) fails\nto have the extension property.\n2.3. D-modular states and ideals of (C, D). In this final subsection, we make a simple observation: the action N(C, D) \u220b v 7\u2192 \u03b2v \u2208 InvO D\u0302 may be regarded as an action on certain states of\nC.\nDefinition 2.13. Let (C, D) be an inclusion. A state \u03c1 on C is D-modular if for every x \u2208 C and\nd \u2208 D,\n\u03c1(dx) = \u03c1(d)\u03c1(x) = \u03c1(xd).\n12\n\n\fWe let Mod(C, D) be the collection of all D-modular states on C; equip Mod(C, D) with the relative\nweak-\u2217 topology. Then Mod(C, D) is closed and hence is compact. Using the Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality, it is easy to see that\nMod(C, D) = {\u03c1 \u2208 S(C) : \u03c1|D \u2208 D\u0302}.\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, let Mod(C, D, \u03c3) be the set of all state extensions of \u03c3, so\nMod(C, D, \u03c3) := {\u03c1 \u2208 S(C) : \u03c1|D = \u03c3}.\nThe following simple observation will be useful during the sequel.\nLemma 2.14. Let (C, D) be an inclusion, and v \u2208 N(C, D). If \u03c3 \u2208 dom(\u03b2v ) and \u03b2v (\u03c3) 6= \u03c3, then\n\u03c1(v) = 0 for every \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D, \u03c3).\nProof. Let d \u2208 D satisfy \u03b2v (\u03c3)(d) = 0 and \u03c3(d) = 1. Then for \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D, \u03c3), we have\n\u03c1(v) =\n\n\u03c1(vv \u2217 v)\n\u03c1(dvv \u2217 v)\n\u03c1(vv \u2217 dv)\n=\n=\n= \u03c1(v)\u03b2v (\u03c3)(d) = 0.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c1(v v)\n\u03c3(v v)\n\u03c3(v \u2217 v)\n\u0003\n\nWhen \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D) and v \u2208 N(C, D) satisfies \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0, the state \u03b2\u0303v (\u03c1) on C given by\n\u03b2\u0303v (\u03c1)(x) :=\n\n\u03c1(v \u2217 xv)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\n\nagain belongs to Mod(C, D). When there is no danger of confusion, we sometimes simplify notation and write \u03b2v (\u03c1) instead of \u03b2 \u0303v (\u03c1). Thus N(C, D) also acts on Mod(C, D), and for every\n\u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D), we have \u03b2\u0303v (\u03c1)|D = \u03b2v (\u03c1|D ).\nDefinition 2.15. A subset F \u2286 Mod(C, D) is N(C, D)-invariant if for every v \u2208 N(C, D) and \u03c1 \u2208 F\nwith \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0, we have \u03b2\u0303v (\u03c1) \u2208 F .\nWe record the following fact for use in the sequel.\nProposition 2.16. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion and suppose that F \u2286 Mod(C, D) is N(C, D)invariant. Then the set\nKF := {x \u2208 C : \u03c1(x\u2217 x) = 0 for all \u03c1 \u2208 F }\nis a closed, two-sided ideal in C. Moreover, if {\u03c1|D : \u03c1 \u2208 F } is weak-\u2217 dense in D\u0302, then KF \u2229D = (0).\nProof. As KF is the intersection of closed left-ideals, it remains only to prove that KF is a right\nideal. By regularity, it suffices to prove that if x \u2208 KF and v \u2208 N(C, D), then xv \u2208 KF . Let \u03c1 \u2208 F .\nIf \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0, then by hypothesis, we obtain \u03c1(v \u2217 x\u2217 xv) = \u03b2v (\u03c1)(x\u2217 x)\u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0. On the other\nhand, if \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0, then \u03c1(v \u2217 x\u2217 xv) \u2264 kx\u2217 xk \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0. In either case, we find \u03c1(v \u2217 x\u2217 xv) = 0. As\nthis holds for every \u03c1 \u2208 F, we find xv \u2208 KF , as desired. The final statement is obvious.\n\u0003\n3. Pseudo-Conditional Expectations for Regular MASA Inclusions\nAs noted in Example 1.2, there exist regular MASA inclusions (C, D) for which no conditional\nexpectation of C onto D exists. The purpose of this section is to show that nevertheless, there is\nalways a unique pseudo-expectation for a regular MASA inclusion.\nGiven a normalizer v, our first task is to connect the dynamics of \u03b2v with the ideal structure of\nD.\n\u02c6 \u2286 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 ,\nLemma 3.1. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and suppose v \u2208 N(C, D). If d \u2208 D and supp(d)\nthen vd = dv. Moreover, if (C, D) is a MASA inclusion, then vd = dv \u2208 D.\n13\n\n\fProof. Note that v \u2217 dv and v \u2217 vd both belong to D. We first show that for every \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302,\n\u03c1(v \u2217 dv) = \u03c1(v \u2217 vd).\n\n(5)\n\nLet \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302. There are three cases. First suppose \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0. Then as \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = kvk2\u03c1 , the CauchySchwartz inequality gives,\n|\u03c1(v \u2217 dv)| = | hdv, vi\u03c1 | \u2264 kdvk\u03c1 kvk\u03c1 = 0,\nso (5) holds when \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0.\n\u02c6 so \u03b2v (\u03c1) \u2208 fix \u03b2v =\nSuppose next that \u03c1(v \u2217 v) > 0 and \u03b2v (\u03c1)(d) 6= 0. Then \u03b2v (\u03c1) \u2208 supp(d),\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfix \u03b2v\u2217 . Thus, we get \u03b2v (\u03c1) = \u03b2v\u2217 (\u03b2v (\u03c1)) = \u03c1, and hence \u03c1(v dv) = \u03c1(v v)\u03c1(d) = \u03c1(v \u2217 vd).\nFinally suppose that \u03c1(v \u2217 v) > 0 and \u03b2v (\u03c1)(d) = 0. Then \u03c1(v \u2217 dv) = 0. We shall show that \u03c1(d) =\n\u2217 dv)\n0. If not, the hypothesis on d shows that \u03c1 \u2208 fix \u03b2v . Hence, 0 6= \u03c1(d) = \u03b2v (\u03c1)(d) = \u03c1(v\n\u03c1(v\u2217 v) = 0,\nwhich is absurd. So \u03c1(d) = 0, and (5) holds in this case also. Thus we have established (5) in all\ncases.\nThus v \u2217 dv = v \u2217 vd. So for every n \u2208 N,\n0 = v \u2217 dv \u2212 v \u2217 vd = v \u2217 (dv \u2212 vd) = vv \u2217 (dv \u2212 vd) = (vv \u2217 )n (dv \u2212 vd).\nIt follows that for every polynomial p with p(0) = 0, we have, p(vv \u2217 )(dv \u2212 vd) = 0. Therefore, for\nevery n \u2208 N,\n0 = (vv \u2217 )1/n (dv \u2212 vd) = d(vv \u2217 )1/n v \u2212 (vv \u2217 )1/n vd.\nSince limn\u2192\u221e (vv \u2217 )1/n v = v, we have vd = dv.\nc \u2286 supp(d)\n\u02c6 \u2286\nNow suppose that (C, D) is a MASA inclusion. For a \u2208 D, we have supp(da)\n\u25e6\n(fix \u03b2v ) , so we have v(da) = (da)v. Since vd = dv, we get (vd)a = a(vd). Since D is a MASA,\nvd \u2208 D and the proof is complete.\n\u0003\n\u02c6 \u2286 fix \u03b2v , then we actually have supp(d)\n\u02c6 \u2286\nLet v \u2208 N(C, D). Observe that if d \u2208 D and supp(d)\n\u25e6\n(fix \u03b2v ) . Thus\n\u02c6 \u2286 fix \u03b2v } = {d \u2208 D : supp(d)\n\u02c6 \u2286 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 }\n{d \u2208 D : supp(d)\nis a closed ideal of D isomorphic to C0 ((fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 ). By the Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum commutation\ntheorem,\n{d \u2208 D : dv = vd} = {d \u2208 D : dv \u2217 = v \u2217 d},\n\n(6)\n\nand it follows that {d \u2208 D : dv = vd \u2208 D} is a closed ideal of D. The next proposition shows how\nthe set (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 may be described algebraically.\nProposition 3.2. Let (C, D) be a MASA inclusion. If v \u2208 N(C, D), then\n\u02c6 \u2286 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 } = Dv \u2217 v \u2229 {d \u2208 D : dv = vd \u2208 D}.\n{d \u2208 D : supp(d)\n\u2217 v)}.

Let \u03c10 \u2208 supp(d)\n\nr := |\u03c10 (d)|. Then r > 0. Put G = {\u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 : |\u03c1(d)| > r/2}. We show that G \u2286 fix \u03b2v . Fix\n\u2217 v)), so \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0. Since d belongs to the ideal\n\u02c6 \u2286 supp((vd\n\u03c1 \u2208 G. Since d \u2208 Dv \u2217 v, we have supp(d)\n{f \u2208 D : f v = vf \u2208 D}, we find (using (6)) that for every a \u2208 D,\n\u03b2v (\u03c1)(a) =\n\n\u03c1(v \u2217 avd)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 (ad)v)\n\u03c1(adv \u2217 v)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 av)\n=\n=\n=\n= \u03c1(a).\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(d)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(d)\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(d)\n14\n\n\fIt follows that G \u2286 fix \u03b2v . Since G is an open subset of D\u0302 with \u03c10 \u2208 G, we have \u03c10 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 . So\n\u02c6 \u2286 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 , as desired.\nsupp(d)\n\u0003\nWe need some notation.\nNotation. Let (C, D) be an inclusion.\na) For a closed ideal J in D, we let\nJ\u22a5 := {d \u2208 D : dg = 0 for all g \u2208 J}\ndenote the complement of J in the lattice of closed ideals of D.\nb) Given any two closed ideals J1 and J2 in D, J1 \u2228 J2 denotes the closed ideal generated by\nJ1 and J2 .\nc) For S \u2286 D, hSiD denotes the closed two-sided ideal of D generated by the set S.

It is easy to see that Jv \u2286 Kv\u22a5 . If equality holds,\nthen the fact that Jv \u2228 Kv is an essential ideal follows readily. However, we have not found a simple\nproof of this fact, so we proceed along different lines.\nProposition 3.3. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion and let v \u2208 N(C, D). Then Jv \u2228 Kv is\nan essential ideal in D.\nProof. We shall show that Jv \u2228 Kv is essential by showing that (Jv \u2228 Kv )\u22a5 = (0). Suppose that\nd \u2208 D and d(Jv \u2228 Kv ) = 0.\nFirst we show\n(8)\n\n\u2217 v.\nsupp d\u02c6 \u2286 supp vd\n\n\u2217 v, then we may find h \u2208 D such that \u0125(\u03c1) = 1 and \u0125(\u03c3) = 0 for\nIndeed, if \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302 and \u03c1 \u2208\n/ supp vd\n\u2217 v. Then h \u2208 hv \u2217 vi\u22a5 \u2286 K , so dh = 0. As \u03c1(h) = 1, this shows that \u03c1 \u2208\n\u02c6\nevery \u03c3 \u2208 supp vd\n/ supp d.\nv\nThus (8) holds.\nNext, we claim that\n\n(9)\n\n\u2217 v \u2286 (fix \u03b2 )\u25e6 .\nsupp d\u02c6 \u2229 supp vd\nv\n\n\u2217 v. For every h \u2208 D, we have v \u2217 hv \u2212 v \u2217 vh \u2208 K . Since \u03c1(d) 6= 0 and\nLet \u03c1 \u2208 supp d\u02c6 \u2229 supp vd\nv\n\u22a5\n\u2217\nd \u2208 Kv , this gives \u03c1(v hv) = \u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(h) for every h \u2208 D. Since \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0 by hypothesis, we have\n\u2217 v is an open subset of D\u0302, we obtain (9).\n\u03c1 \u2208 fix \u03b2v . As supp d\u02c6 \u2229 supp vd\n\u25e6\nSuppose that \u03c1 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v ) . By Proposition 3.2 there exists h \u2208 Jv so that \u03c1(h) = 1. Since\nd \u2208 Jv\u22a5 , we obtain \u03c1(d) = 0. Hence\n\n(10)\n\n(fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 \u2229 supp d\u02c6 = \u2205.\n\nCombining (8), (9), and (10) we obtain,\n\u2217 v \\ supp v\n\u2217 v.\nd\nsupp d\u02c6 \u2286 supp vd\n\n\u2217 v \\ supp v\n\u2217 v has empty interior, so supp d\u02c6 = \u2205. Therefore, d = 0 as desired.\nd\nBut supp vd\n15\n\n\u0003\n\n\fThe following is probably well known, but we include it for completeness. Recall that if A is a\nunital injective C \u2217 -algebra, then any bounded increasing net x\u03bb of self-adjoint elements of A has a\nleast upper bound in A, which we denote by supA x\u03bb .\nLemma 3.4. Let D be a unital, abelian C \u2217 -algebra, let (I(D), \u03b9) be an injective envelope for D and\nsuppose that J \u2286 D is a closed ideal. Let J1+ be the positive part of the unit ball of J and regard\nJ1+ as a net indexed by itself. Put P := supI(D) \u03b9(J1+ ). Then P is an projection in I(D).\nIf in addition, J is an essential ideal of D, the following hold:\ni) if a, b \u2208 I(D) and a\u03b9(h) = b\u03b9(h) for every h \u2208 J, then a = b;\nii) P = I.\nProof. The mapping x \u2208 J1+ 7\u2192 x1/2 \u2208 J1+ is an order isomorphism of J1+ , so P = supI(D) {\u03b9(x1/2 ) :\nx \u2208 J1+ }. So P 2 is also an upper bound for \u03b9(J1+ ). Hence P \u2264 P 2 . But as kP k \u2264 1, we have\nP 2 \u2264 P . So P is a projection.\nNow assume J is an essential ideal, and suppose a, b \u2208 I(D) satisfy (a \u2212 b)\u03b9(h) = 0 for every\nh \u2208 J. By Hamana-regularity of \u03b9(D) in I(D), we have |a\u2212 b| = supI(D) {d \u2208 D : 0 \u2264 \u03b9(d) \u2264 |a\u2212 b|}.\nBut K := {d \u2208 D : \u03b9(d) \u2208 h|a \u2212 b|iI(D) } is a closed ideal of D with K \u2286 J \u22a5 . Hence K = 0, so\n|a \u2212 b| = 0.\nNotice that if d \u2208 J1+ , then \u03b9(d)P = \u03b9(d). It follows that for every d \u2208 J, \u03b9(d)P = \u03b9(d). By\npart (i), P = I when J is an essential ideal.\n\u0003\nThe following extension of Definition 2.13 will be useful.\nDefinition 3.5.

Let D be an abelian C \u2217 -algebra and let (I(D), \u03b9) be an injective envelope for D. Then\n\u03b9 is D-thick in I(D).\nProof. Suppose b \u2208 I(D) is non-zero. The Hamana regularity of I(D) ensures that there exists a\nd \u2229 supp(b\u0302) = \u2205.\nnon-zero h \u2208 D such that 0 \u2264 \u03b9(h) \u2264 b\u2217 b. If d \u2208 D satisfies \u03b9(d)b = 0, then supp(\u03b9(d))\nd \u2286 supp(b\u0302), we get \u03b9(dh) = 0, whence h \u2208 {d \u2208 D : \u03b9(d)b = 0}\u22a5 .\nSince supp(\u03b9(h))\n\u0003\nOur interest in D-thick homomorphisms will be with the restrictions of D-modular maps to D.\nThe following lemma will be useful.\n\nLemma 3.7. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, let B be a unital abelian Banach algebra\nand let v \u2208 N(C, D). For i = 1, 2, suppose \u2206i : C \u2192 B are bounded D-modular maps such that\n\u22061 |D = \u22062 |D and set \u03b9 := \u2206i |D . Then for every h \u2208 Jv \u2228 Kv ,\n(11)\n\n\u22061 (vh) = \u22062 (vh).\n\nIn fact,\na) for every h \u2208 Kv , \u22061 (vh) = 0 = \u22062 (vh);\nb) for every h \u2208 Jv , \u22061 (vh) = \u03b9(vh) = \u22062 (vh).\nMoreover, if \u03b9 is also D-thick in B, then \u22061 = \u22062 .\n16\n\n\fProof. For (a), we consider two cases. First, if h \u2208 hv \u2217 vi\u22a5 , then for i = 1, 2,\n\u2206i (vh) = lim \u2206i (v(v \u2217 v)1/n h) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nSecond, suppose that h \u2208\n\n{v \u2217 dv\n\u2217\n\n\u2212\n\nv \u2217 vd\n\n: d \u2208 D}. Then for some d \u2208 D,\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2206i (vh) = \u2206i (v(v dv \u2212 v vd)) = \u2206i (vv \u2217 dv) \u2212 \u2206i (vv \u2217 vd)\n= \u03b9(dv \u2217 v)\u2206i (v) \u2212 \u2206i (vv \u2217 v)\u03b9(d) = \u03b9(d)\u2206i (v)\u03b9(v \u2217 v) \u2212 \u03b9(d)\u2206i (vv \u2217 v) = 0.\nThus \u2206i (vh) = 0 for all h in a generating set for Kv . Since \u2206i are D-modular and bounded, we\nobtain (a).\nNext, suppose that h \u2208 Jv . Then since vh \u2208 D,\n(12)\n\n\u22061 (vh) = \u03b9(vh) = \u22062 (vh).\n\nThis gives (b).\nParts (a) and (b) imply that \u22061 (vh) = \u22062 (vh) for all h in a generating set for Jv \u2228 Kv , so\nboundedness and D-modularity of \u2206i yields (11).\nNow suppose that \u03b9 is D-thick in B and v \u2208 N(C, D). Let b = \u22061 (v) \u2212 \u22062 (v) and choose any\nh \u2208 {d \u2208 D : b\u03b9(d) = 0}\u22a5 \u2229 (Jv \u2228 Kv ). Since h \u2208 Jv \u2228 Kv , we have b\u03b9(h) = \u22061 (v)\u03b9(h) \u2212 \u22062 (v)\u03b9(h) =\n\u22061 (vh) \u2212 \u22062 (vh) = 0. Since h \u2208 {d \u2208 D : b\u03b9(d) = 0}\u22a5 , we get h2 = 0. As D is abelian, h = 0.\nThis shows that {d \u2208 D : b\u03b9(d) = 0}\u22a5 \u2229 (Jv \u2228 Kv ) = (0). Since Jv \u2228 Kv is an essential ideal,\n{d \u2208 D : b\u03b9(d) = 0}\u22a5 = (0). Since \u03b9 is D-thick in B, we see that b = 0. Hence \u22061 (v) = \u22062 (v).\nSince this holds for every v \u2208 N(C, D), regularity of (C, D) yields \u22061 = \u22062 .\n\u0003\nLemma 3.7 has an interesting consequence for uniqueness of extensions of pure states on D to C,\nwhich we now present. This result generalizes a result found in [31], however, the proof is rather\ndifferent. Notice that Theorem 3.8 holds when C is separable or when there is a countable subset\nX \u2286 N(C, D) such that C is the C \u2217 -algebra generated by D and X. We shall use Theorem 3.8 in\nthe proof of Theorem 9.2.\nTheorem 3.8. Suppose (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion and that N \u2286 N(C, D) is a countable\nset such that the norm-closed D-bimodule generated by N is C. Let\nU := {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3 has a unique state extension to C}.\nThen U is dense in D\u0302.\nProof. For each v \u2208 N , let Gv := {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3|Jv \u2228Kv 6= 0}. Clearly Gv is open in D\u0302 and since Jv \u2228 Kv\nis an essential ideal in D, Gv is dense in D\u0302. Baire's theorem shows that\n\\\nP :=\nGv\nv\u2208N\n\nis dense in D\u0302.\nLet \u03c3 \u2208 P and suppose for i = 1, 2, \u03c1i are states on C such that \u03c1i |D = \u03c3. The Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality shows that \u03c1i : C \u2192 C are D-modular maps.\nFix v \u2208 N . Since \u03c3 \u2208 Gv , we may find h \u2208 Jv \u2228 Kv such that \u03c3(h) = 1. By Lemma 3.7 we have\n\u03c11 (v) = \u03c11 (v)\u03c3(h) = \u03c11 (vh) = \u03c12 (vh) = \u03c12 (v)\u03c3(h) = \u03c12 (v).\nSince N generates C as a D-bimodule and \u03c1i are D-modular, we see that \u03c11 = \u03c12 . Hence P \u2286 U,\nand the proof is complete.\n\u0003\nWe now show that any regular MASA inclusion has a unique completely positive mapping E :\nC \u2192 I(D) which extends the inclusion mapping of D into I(D).\n17\n\n\fLemma 3.9. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and (I(D), \u03b9) an injective envelope of D. Let E : C \u2192 I(D)\nbe a pseudo-expectation for \u03b9. Then E is D-modular.\n[ and put \u03c3 = \u03c1 \u25e6 E. Then \u03c3|D \u2208 D\u0302, so the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality implies\nProof. Let \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)\nthat for every x \u2208 C and d \u2208 D, \u03c3(xd) = \u03c3(x)\u03c3(d). Hence,\n\u03c1(E(xd)) = \u03c3(xd) = \u03c3(x)\u03c3(d) = \u03c1(E(x))\u03c1(E(d)) = \u03c1(E(x)E(d)).\n[ we obtain E(xd) = E(x)E(d). The proof that E(dx) = E(d)E(x)\nAs this holds for every \u03c1 \u2208 I(D),\nis similar.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.10. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, and let (I(D), \u03b9) be an injective envelope\nof D. Then there exists a unique pseudo-expectation E : C \u2192 I(D) for \u03b9. Furthermore, suppose\nv \u2208 N(C, D). Then\na) E(vh) = \u03b9(vh) for every h \u2208 Jv ;\nb) E(vh) = 0 for every h \u2208 Kv ;\nc) |E(v)|2 = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P , where P := supI(D) (\u03b9((Jv )+\n1 )).\nProof. The injectivity of I(D) guarantees the existence of a completely positive unital map E :\nC \u2192 I(D) such that for every d \u2208 D,\n(13)\n\nE(d) = \u03b9(d).\n\nLemma 3.7 and Lemma 3.6 imply that E is unique.\nNow suppose that v \u2208 N(C, D). Since E|D = \u03b9, parts (a) and (b) follow from Lemma 3.7.\nWe turn now to (c). Observe that Kv \u2286 Jv\u22a5 . Indeed Jv \u2286 hv \u2217 vi, so if h \u2208 hv \u2217 vi\u22a5 then hJv = 0.\nOn the other hand, if d \u2208 D and h = v \u2217 dv \u2212 v \u2217 vd, then for g \u2208 Jv , we have hg = (v \u2217 dv \u2212 v \u2217 vd)g =\nv \u2217 dgv \u2212 v \u2217 vdg = 0 because dg \u2208 Jv . Thus hJv = 0 for every h in a generating set for Kv , so\nKv \u2286 Jv\u22a5 .\nNow let h \u2208 Kv . By [20, Corollary 4.10], we have\n\"\n#\n+\n\u2217\n\u03b9(h)\u2217 P \u03b9(h) = \u03b9(h)\u2217 sup \u03b9((Jv )+\n1 ) \u03b9(h) = sup \u03b9(h (Jv )1 h) = 0.\nI(D)\n\nI(D)\n\nSince P is a projection, it follows that \u03b9(h)P = 0. Hence \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P \u03b9(h\u2217 h) = 0. Next, by part (b), we\nhave for every h \u2208 Kv , |E(v)|2 \u03b9(h\u2217 h) = \u03b9(h\u2217 )E(v)\u2217 E(v)\u03b9(h) = \u03b9(h\u2217 )E(v)\u2217 E(vh) = 0. Therefore, for\nh \u2208 Kv ,\n(14)\n\n|E(v)|2 \u03b9(h\u2217 h) = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P \u03b9(h\u2217 h) = 0.\n\nSince E(vh) = \u03b9(vh) for every h \u2208 Jv , we see that for h \u2208 Jv ,\n(15)\n\nE(v \u2217 )E(v)\u03b9(h\u2217 h) = E((vh)\u2217 )E(vh) = \u03b9(h\u2217 v \u2217 )\u03b9(vh) = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)\u03b9(h\u2217 h) = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P \u03b9(h\u2217 h).\n\nCombining (14) and (15), we see that for every h \u2208 Jv \u2228 Kv ,\nE(v)\u2217 E(v)\u03b9(h\u2217 h) = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P \u03b9(h\u2217 h).\nThen E(v)\u2217 E(v) = \u03b9(v \u2217 v)P by Lemma 3.4, so we have (c).\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following \"dual\" to Theorem 3.10 is now easily established. Notice that in the context of\n[ E # (\u03c1) = \u03c1 \u25e6 E \u2208 Mod(C, D).\nTheorem 3.10, when \u03c1 \u2208 I(D),\nTheorem 3.11.

Clearly E # has the stated property, so we need only prove uniqueness.\n[ into Mod(C, D) such that for every \u03c1 \u2208 I(D),\n[\nSuppose that l is a continuous map of I(D)\n[ \u2192 C by \u03c6x (\u03c1) = l(\u03c1)(x). Since l is\nl(\u03c1)|D = \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9. For x \u2208 C, define a function \u03c6x : I(D)\ncontinuous, \u03c6x is continuous. Hence there exists a unique element E1 (x) \u2208 I(D) such that \u03c6x\nis the Gelfand transform of E1 (x). Using the fact that Mod(C, D) \u2286 S(C), we find E1 is linear,\nbounded, unital and positive. Since I(D) is abelian, E1 is completely positive. For d \u2208 D we\nhave \u03c1(E1 (d)) = l(\u03c1)(d) = \u03c1(\u03b9(d)). Therefore, E1 |D = \u03b9, so E1 is a pseudo-expectation for \u03b9. By\nTheorem 3.10, E1 = E, hence l = E # .\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.12. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, let (I(D), \u03b9) be a C \u2217 -envelope for D,\nand let E be the (unique) pseudo-expectation for \u03b9. Define\n[\nSs (C, D) := {\u03c1 \u25e6 E : \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)}.\nWe shall call states belonging to Ss (C, D) strongly compatible states. Clearly, Ss (C, D) is a closed\n[\nsubset of Mod(C, D). Observe that D\u0302 = {\u03c4 |D : \u03c4 \u2208 Ss (C, D)}; this is because D\u0302 = {\u03c1\u25e6\u03b9 : \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)}.\nLet r : Mod(C, D) \u2192 D\u0302 be the restriction map, r(\u03c1) = \u03c1|D . We now show that Ss (C, D) is the\nunique minimal closed subset of Mod(C, D) for which r is onto. In a certain sense, this allows us\nto determine Ss (C, D) without the use of the pseudo-expectation.\nTheorem 3.13. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion and suppose F \u2286 Mod(C, D) is closed and\nr(F ) = D\u0302. Then Ss (C, D) \u2286 F .\nSuppose further that there exists a countable subset N \u2286 N(C, D) such that the norm-closed\nD-bimodule generated by N is C and set\nU(C, D) := {\u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D) : \u03c1|D has a unique state extension to C}.\nThen\nSs (C, D) = U(C, D)\n\nw-\u2217\n\n.\n\n[ is\nProof.

Therefore, the range of E # is contained in F , that\nis, Ss (C, D) \u2286 F .\nSuppose now that there is a countable subset N \u2286 N(C, D) which generates C as a D-bimodule.\nTheorem 3.8 implies that D\u0302 = r(U(C, D)), so we have Ss (C, D) \u2286 U(C, D). To complete the proof,\nobserve that Ss (C, D) is closed and U(C, D) \u2286 Ss (C, D).\n\u0003\nThe following result shows that, in the terminology of Section 4, each element of Ss (C, D) is a\ncompatible state.\nProposition 3.14. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion and let \u03c3 \u2208 Ss (C, D). Then for every\nv \u2208 N(C, D),\n|\u03c3(v)|2 \u2208 {0, \u03c3(v \u2217 v)}.\n[ be such that \u03c3 = \u03c1 \u25e6 E and suppose v \u2208 N(C, D) is such that \u03c3(v) 6= 0. Then\nProof. Let \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)\n2\n0 6= |\u03c1(E(v))| , so by part (c) of Theorem 3.10, \u03c1(P ) 6= 0. By Lemma 3.4, P is a projection, so\n\u03c1(P ) = 1. Thus, |\u03c1(E(v))|2 = \u03c1(\u03b9(v \u2217 v)) = \u03c1(E(v \u2217 v)) = \u03c3(v \u2217 v).\n\u0003\n19\n\n\fOur next goal is Theorem 3.21 below, which shows that Ss (C, D) is an N(C, D)-invariant subset of\nMod(C, D). In the case that C is countably generated as a D-bimodule, this follows from the second\npart of Theorem 3.13, but we have not found a proof in the general case using Theorem 3.13. The\nfact that the left kernel of the pseudo-expectation is an ideal will follow easily from Theorem 3.21,\nsee Theorem 3.22.\nOur route to Theorem 3.21 involves a study of the Gelfand support of E(v) for v \u2208 N(C, D); we\nalso obtain a formula for the Gelfand transform of E(v). We begin with three lemmas on properties\nof projective covers.\nLemma 3.15. Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let (P, f ) be a projective cover for X.\na) If G \u2286 X is an open set, then (f \u22121 (G), f |f \u22121 (G) ) is a projective cover for G.\nb) If Q \u2286 P is clopen, then f (Q)\u25e6 is dense in f (Q) and Q = f \u22121 (f (Q)\u25e6 ).\nProof. Before beginning the proof, observe that if \u03b9 : C(X) \u2192 C(P ) is given by \u03b9(d) = d \u25e6 f , then\n(C(P ), \u03b9) is an injective envelope for C(X).\na) Let Y := f \u22121 (G). Then Y is compact, so f (Y ) is a closed subset of X which contains\nG. Hence G \u2286 f (Y ). On the other hand, f \u22121 (G) is a closed subset of P containing f \u22121 (G), so\nY \u2286 f \u22121 (G). Hence f (Y ) \u2286 G. Therefore (Y, f ) is a cover for G.\nSince P is projective, it is Stonean, and hence Y is clopen in P . Since clopen subsets of projective\nspaces are projective, Y is projective. The proof of part (a) will be complete once we show that\n(Y, f |Y ) is a rigid cover for G (see [17, Theorem 2.16]).\nSo suppose that h : Y \u2192 Y is continuous and f \u25e6 h = f |Y . Define h\u0303 : P \u2192 P by\n(\nh(t) if t \u2208 Y\nh\u0303(t) =\nt\nif t \u2208\n/ Y.\nSince Y is clopen in P , h\u0303 is continuous. Moreover, f \u25e6 h\u0303 = f , so by the rigidity of (P, f ), we see\nthat h\u0303 is the identity map on P . Therefore h is the identity map on Y , which shows that (Y, f |Y )\nis a rigid cover.\nb) The case when Q = \u2205 is trivial, so we assume Q is non-empty. Let\n[\nM := {d \u2208 C(X) : 0 \u2264 \u03b9(d) \u2264 \u03c7Q } and set G :=\nsupp(d).\nd\u2208M\n\nThen G is non-empty because \u03c7Q 6= 0 and (C(P ), \u03b9) is Hamana regular. Notice that f \u22121 (G) \u2286 Q:\nindeed, if p \u2208 f \u22121 (G), then there exists d \u2208 M such that f (p) \u2208 supp(d), so 0 < d(f (p)) \u2264 \u03c7Q (p),\nwhence p \u2208 Q.\nAs P is extremally disconnected, W := f \u22121 (G) is a clopen subset of P . We will show that\nW = Q. Clearly W \u2286 Q. If Q \\ W 6= \u2205, then Q \\ W is a clopen subset of P , so we may find a nonzero d1 \u2208 C(X) with 0 \u2264 \u03b9(d1 ) \u2264 \u03c7Q\\W \u2264 \u03c7Q . But then d1 \u2208 M, so supp(\u03b9(d1 )) \u2286 f \u22121 (G) \u2286 W,\ncontradicting 0 \u2264 \u03b9(d1 ) \u2264 \u03c7Q\\W . Hence W = Q.\nBy part (a), (W, f |W ) is a cover for G. Thus, f (W ) = f (Q) = G. As f \u22121 (G) \u2286 Q, we have\nG \u2286 f (Q)\u25e6 , so that f (Q)\u25e6 is dense in f (Q).\nFinally, put W1 := f \u22121 (f (Q)\u25e6 ). Since G \u2286 f (Q)\u25e6 , we have Q = W \u2286 W1 . Part (a) again shows\nthat (W1 , f |W1 ) is a projective cover for f (Q)\u25e6 = f (Q), so in particular, this cover is essential. The\ninclusion map \u03b1 of W into W1 satisfies f (\u03b1(W )) = f (Q). Because (W1 , f |W1 ) is an essential cover\nof f (Q), we conclude \u03b1 is onto. Thus W = W1 , and the proof of (b) is complete.\n\u0003\nWe leave the proof of the following lemma to the reader.\n20\n\n\fLemma 3.16. Suppose that for i \u2208 {1, 2}, Xi is a compact Hausdorff space and that \u03c6 : X1 \u2192\nX2 is a homeomorphism. Let (Ci , fi ) be a projective cover for Xi . Then there exists a unique\nhomeomorphism \u03a6 : C1 \u2192 C2 such that f2 \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 f1 .\nOur final lemma on projective covers is a strengthening of Lemma 3.16: rather than extending\na homeomorphism to the injective envelope, partial homeomorphisms are extended.\nLemma 3.17. Let (P, f ) be a projective cover for the compact Hausdorff space X and suppose\nh \u2208 InvO (X) is a partial homeomorphism. Then there exists a unique partial homeomorphism\nI(h) \u2208 InvO (P ) such that:\na) dom(I(h)) = f \u22121 (dom(h)), range(I(h)) = f \u22121 (range(h)) and\nb) h \u25e6 f = f \u25e6 I(h).\nProof. Let H1 = dom(h) and H2 = range(h). Set\nT := {G \u2286 H : G is open in X and G \u2286 H1 }.\nLet G \u2208 T. Lemma 3.15 shows that (f \u22121 (G), f ) and (f \u22121 (h(G)), f ) are projective covers for G\nand h(G). By Lemma 3.16, there exists a unique homeomorphism hG : f \u22121 (G) \u2192 f \u22121 (h(G)) such\nthat\nh \u25e6 f |f \u22121 (G) = f \u25e6 hG .\nWe now let I(h) be the inductive limit of {hG }G\u2208T . Here is an outline.\nSince\n[\n[\n[\n[\nG = H1 =\nG we have\nf \u22121 (G) = f \u22121 (H1 ) =\nf \u22121 (G).\nG\u2208T\n\nin\n\nG\u2208T\n\nG\u2208T\n\nG\u2208T\n\nLet G1 , G2 \u2208 T and suppose G1 \u2229 G2 6= \u2205. Put Q := f \u22121 (G1 ) \u2229 f \u22121 (G2 ).\nP , so by Lemma 3.15, Q = f \u22121 (f (Q)\u25e6 ). Note that f (Q)\u25e6 \u2208 T. Hence\n\nThen Q is a clopen set\n\nh \u25e6 f |Q = h \u25e6 f |f \u22121 (f (Q)\u25e6 ) = f \u25e6 hf (Q)\u25e6 .\nThus, for i = 1, 2,\nf \u25e6 hGi |Q = h \u25e6 f |Q .\nThis means that given p \u2208 P , we may define I(h)(p) = hG (p) where G is any element of T containing\np.\nClearly I(h) satisfies (a) and (b). If H is another such map, then for every G \u2208 T, the restrictions\nof H and I(h) to f \u22121 (G) are both equal to hG ; this gives uniqueness of I(h). The continuity and\nbijectivity of I(h) are left to the reader.\n\u0003\n[ \u03b9# |\nWhen (I(D), \u03b9) is an injective envelope for D, (I(D),\n[ ) is a projective cover for D\u0302.

As range(I(\u03b2v )) is an open subset of I(D),\n\u22121\nassume that \u03c1\u03b1 \u2208 range(I(\u03b2v )) for every \u03b1. Put \u03c4\u03b1 = I(\u03b2v ) (\u03c1\u03b1 ), so (\u03c4\u03b1 )\u03b1 is a net in dom(I(\u03b2v ))\nsuch that \u03c4\u03b1 \u2192 \u03c4 . Since \u03c1\u03b1 \u25e6\u03b9 \u2208 (fix \u03b2w )\u25e6 , given \u03b1 we may find d\u03b1 \u2208 Jw such that 0 6= \u03c1\u03b1 (\u03b9(d\u03b1 )). But\n\u03c1\u03b1 (\u03b9(d\u03b1 )) = I(\u03b2v )(\u03c4\u03b1 )(\u03b9(d\u03b1 )) = \u03b2v (\u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9)(d\u03b1 ). Taking \u03bb = \u03c4\u03b1 in (20) shows that \u03bc\u03c4\u03b1 (w) = \u03bc\u2032\u03c4\u03b1 (w).\nContinuity of the maps \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bc\u03bb and \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bc\u2032\u03bb gives \u03bc\u03c4 (w) = \u03bc\u2032\u03c4 (w).\n\\\n\u2217 wv)), so there exists a net \u03c4 \u2208\nTurning to (2), suppose \u03bc\u03c4 (w) 6= 0.

Then \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9 \u2208 dom(\u03b2v\u2217 wv ) \u2286 dom \u03b2v . Thus, for a given \u03b1, we may\nfind a neighborhood N of \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9 with N \u2286 (fix \u03b2v\u2217 wv )\u25e6 \u2229 dom(\u03b2v ). Now for each y \u2208 N , we have\n\u03b2v\u2217 wv (y) = y, so \u03b2w ((\u03b2v )(y)) = \u03b2v (y). Hence \u03b2v (N ) \u2286 fix(\u03b2w ). Therefore \u03b2v (\u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9) \u2208 fix(\u03b2w )\u25e6 .\nSo if d \u2208 Jw satisfies \u03b2v (\u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9)(d) 6= 0, then (20) gives \u03bc\u2032\u03c4\u03b1 (w) = \u03bc\u03c4\u03b1 (w). Continuity again gives\n\u03bc\u2032\u03c4 (w) = \u03bc\u03c4 (w).\nThus both (1) and (2) hold, and the proof is complete.\n\u0003\nWe now show the left kernel of the pseudo-expectation on a regular MASA inclusion is an ideal\nwhich is the unique ideal which is maximal with respect to being disjoint from D.\nTheorem 3.22. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion. Then the left kernel of the pseudoexpectation E,\nL(C, D) := {x \u2208 C : E(x\u2217 x) = 0}\nis an ideal of C such that L(C, D) \u2229 D = (0).\nMoreover, if K \u2286 C is an ideal such that K \u2229 D = (0), then K \u2286 L(C, D).\nProof. Theorem 3.21 shows that Ss (C, D) satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 2.16. In the\nnotation of Proposition 2.16, we have L(C, D) = KSs (C,D) , so L(C, D) is a norm-closed two-sided\nideal of C. If x \u2208 L(C, D) \u2229 D, then 0 = E(x\u2217 x) = \u03b9(x\u2217 x). As \u03b9 is one-to-one, x = 0.\n23\n\n\fSuppose now that K \u2286 C is an ideal with K \u2229 D = (0). Let C1 = C/K, and let q : C \u2192 C1 be the\nquotient map. Since K \u2229 D = (0), q|D is faithful, so we may regard D as a subalgebra of C1 . Let\nF := {\u03c1 \u25e6 q : \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C1 , D)}. Then F is a closed subset of Mod(C, D), and the restriction map,\nf \u2208 F 7\u2192 f |D maps F onto D\u0302. By Theorem 3.13, Ss (C, D) \u2286 F . Hence every element of Ss (C, D)\nannihilates K, so K \u2286 L(C, D).\n\u0003\nThe ideal L(C, D) behaves reasonably well with respect to certain regular \u2217-homomorphisms, as\nthe next result shows.\nCorollary 3.23. Suppose for i = 1, 2 that (Ci , Di ) are regular MASA inclusions, and that \u03b1 :\n(C1 , D1 ) \u2192 (C2 , D2 ) is a regular \u2217-homomorphism such that \u03b1|D is one-to-one. Then\n(21)\n\n{x \u2208 C1 : \u03b1(a) \u2208 L(C2 , D2 )} \u2286 L(C1 , D1 ).\n\nProof. The set {x \u2208 C1 : \u03b1(x) \u2208 L(C2 , D2 )} is an ideal of C1 whose intersection with D1 is\ntrivial.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.24. We expect that equality holds in (21) if for every 0 \u2264 h \u2208 D2 , h = supD2 {\u03b1(d) :\nd \u2208 D1 and 0 \u2264 \u03b1(d) \u2264 h}. Also, it would not be surprising if this condition characterized equality\nin (21).\nSince every Cartan inclusion (C, D) satisfies L(C, D) = (0), we make the following definition.\nDefinition 3.25. A virtual Cartan inclusion is a regular MASA inclusion such that L(C, D) = (0).\n4. Compatible States\nSince the extension property does not always hold for an inclusion (C, D), we identify a useful\nclass of states in Mod(C, D), which we call D-compatible states.\nTo motivate the definition, observe that when (C, D) is a regular EP inclusion, the only way to\nextend a pure state \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 to C is via composition with the expectation: \u03c1 := \u03c3 \u25e6 E. Then the GNS\nrepresentation (\u03c0\u03c1 , H\u03c1 ) arising from \u03c1 has the property that for any v \u2208 N(C, D) either I + L\u03c1 and\nv + L\u03c1 are orthogonal in the Hilbert space H\u03c1 , or one is a scalar multiple of the other, according\nto whether or not the Gelfand transform of E(v) is zero in a neighborhood of \u03c3. Furthermore,\nthe techniques used in the proof of [10, Proposition 5.4] show that \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is an atomic MASA in\nB(H\u03c1 ) and also that for every v \u2208 N(C, D), v + L\u03c1 is an eigenvector for \u03c0\u03c1 (D). The intersection J\nof the kernels of such representations is the left kernel of the expectation E, D \u2229 J = (0), and the\nquotient of (C, D) by J yields a C \u2217 -diagonal with the same coordinate system as (C, D), see [10,\nTheorem 4.8].\nWe shall define the set of compatible states to be those states \u03c1 on C for which the vectors\n{v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 N(C, D)} form an orthogonal set of vectors. These states have many of the properties\nlisted in the previous paragraph, but have the advantage of not needing the extension property or\na conditional expectation for their definition. Here is the formal definition.\nDefinition 4.1. Let (C, D) be an inclusion.\n(1) A state \u03c1 on C is called D-compatible if for every v \u2208 N(C, D),\n|\u03c1(v)|2 \u2208 {0, \u03c1(v \u2217 v)}.\nWhen the context is clear, we will simply use the term compatible state instead of Dcompatible state.\n(2) We will use S(C, D) to denote the set of all D-compatible states on C. Topologize S(C, D)\nwith the relative weak-\u2217 topology.\n24\n\n\f(3) For \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), let \u2206\u03c1 := {v \u2208 N(C, D) : \u03c1(v) 6= 0}, and \u039b\u03c1 := {v \u2208 N(C, D) : \u03c1(v \u2217 v) > 0}.\nDefine a relation \u223c\u03c1 on \u039b\u03c1 by (v, w) \u2208\u223c\u03c1 if and only if v \u2217 w \u2208 \u2206\u03c1 . (We shall prove that \u223c\u03c1\nis an equivalence relation momentarily, and then will simply write v \u223c\u03c1 w.)\nRemarks 4.2.\n(1) When (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, Proposition 3.14 shows that Ss (C, D) \u2286 S(C, D).\n(2) As |\u03c1(x)|2 \u2264 \u03c1(x\u2217 x) for any state \u03c1 \u2208 C# and any x \u2208 C, we see that D-compatible states\nsatisfy an extremal property relative to the normalizers for D, and one might expect an\ninclusion relationship between compatible states and pure states. However, there is not.\nExample 7.17 gives an example of a Cartan inclusion (C, D) and element of S(C, D) which is\nnot a pure state on C, while Example 7.16 gives an example of a Cartan inclusion (C, D) and\na pure state \u03c1 on C such that \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D), yet \u03c1 \u2208\n/ S(C, D). As we shall see momentarily,\nS(C, D) \u2286 Mod(C, D). Thus no such inclusion relationship exists.\n(3) For general inclusions, it is possible that S(C, D) = \u2205 (see Theorem 4.8).\n(4) The following simple observation will be useful during the sequel: for i = 1, 2, let (Ci , Di )\nbe inclusions and suppose that \u03b1 : C1 \u2192 C2 is a regular and unital \u2217-homomorphism. Then\n\u03b1# (S(C2 , D2 )) \u2286 S(C1 , D1 ).\nHere are some properties of elements of S(C, D) which hold for any inclusion.\nProposition 4.3. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and let \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D). The following statements hold.\n(1) Suppose v \u2208 \u2206\u03c1 . Then for every x \u2208 C,\n\u03c1(vx) = \u03c1(v)\u03c1(x) = \u03c1(xv).\n(2) The restriction of \u03c1 to D is a multiplicative linear functional on D.\n(3) Suppose v \u2208 \u2206\u03c1 . Then for every x \u2208 C,\n\u03c1(v \u2217 xv) = \u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(x).\n(4) If v1 , v2 \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 and (v1 , v2 ) \u2208\u223c\u03c1 , then\n|\u03c1(v1\u2217 v2 )|2 = \u03c1(v1\u2217 v1 )\u03c1(v2\u2217 v2 ).\nMoreover, \u223c\u03c1 is an equivalence relation on \u039b\u03c1 .\n(5) S(C, D) is an N(C, D)-invariant subset of Mod(C, D).\n(6) If v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 , then v + L\u03c1 is an eigenvector for \u03c0\u03c1 (D); in particular, for every d \u2208 D,\n\u03c0\u03c1 (d)(v + L\u03c1 ) =\n\n\u03c1(v \u2217 dv)\nv + L\u03c1 .\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\n\n(7) The set S(C, D) is weak-\u2217 closed in C# and the restriction mapping, \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) 7\u2192 \u03c1|D ,\nis a weak-\u2217\u2013weak-\u2217 continuous mapping of S(C, D) into D\u0302.\nProof. Statement (1). Since \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), an easy calculation yields v \u2212 \u03c1(v)I \u2208 L\u03c1 . But L\u03c1 is a\nleft ideal and L\u03c1 \u2286 ker \u03c1. So for x \u2208 C, we have \u03c1(x(v \u2212 \u03c1(v)I)) = 0. So \u03c1(xv) = \u03c1(x)\u03c1(v). As\n\u03c1(v \u2217 ) = \u03c1(v) 6= 0, a similar argument shows that 0 = \u03c1((v \u2212 \u03c1(v)I)x). So part (1) holds.\nStatement (2). Since D \u2286 N(C, D), this follows from part (1) and continuity of \u03c1.\nStatement (3). This follows from part (1) and the fact that \u2206\u03c1 is closed under the adjoint\noperation.\nStatement (4). Let \u03c3 = \u03c1|D and for i = 1, 2 put \u03c3i = \u03b2vi (\u03c3). Then \u03c31 = \u03c32 by statement (3) and\nProposition 2.4. Therefore, since \u03c1(v1\u2217 v2 ) 6= 0, we have\n|\u03c1(v1\u2217 v2 )|2 = \u03c1(v2\u2217 v1 v1\u2217 v2 ) = \u03c32 (v1 v1\u2217 )\u03c3(v2\u2217 v2 ) = \u03c31 (v1 v1\u2217 )\u03c3(v2\u2217 v2 ) = \u03c1(v1\u2217 v1 )\u03c1(v2\u2217 v2 ).\n25\n\n\fClearly the relation \u223c\u03c1 is reflexive and symmetric on \u039b\u03c1 . For i = 1, 2, 3, suppose vi \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 ,\n(v1 , v2 ) \u2208\u223c\u03c1 and (v2 , v3 ) \u2208\u223c\u03c1 . The equality verified in the previous paragraph shows that in H\u03c1 ,\n| hv1 + L\u03c1 , v2 + L\u03c1 i\u03c1 |2 = kv1 + L\u03c1 k2\u03c1 kv2 + L\u03c1 k2\u03c1 . Hence there exists a non-zero scalar t such that\ntv1 + L\u03c1 = v2 + L\u03c1 . Similarly, there exists a non-zero scalar s such that v2 + L\u03c1 = sv3 + L\u03c1 . So\n{v1 + L\u03c1 , v3 + L\u03c1 } is a linearly dependent set of non-zero linearly vectors in H\u03c1 . Thus \u03c1(v1\u2217 v3 ) 6= 0,\nwhence (v1 , v3 ) \u223c\u03c1 .\nStatement (5). Let v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 . For w \u2208 N(C, D), we claim that |\u03c1(w\u2217 v)|2 \u2208 {0, \u03c1(w\u2217 w)\u03c1(v \u2217 v)}. If\n\u03c1(w\u2217 v) 6= 0, then as |\u03c1(w\u2217 v)|2 \u2264 \u03c1(w\u2217 w)\u03c1(v \u2217 v), we find that w \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 and w \u223c\u03c1 v, so the claim holds\nby statement (4). Hence\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|\u03c1(v \u2217 (wv))|2\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(v \u2217 w\u2217 wv)\n|\u03b2v (\u03c1)(w)|2 =\n\u2208\n0,\n= {0, \u03b2v (\u03c1)(w\u2217 w)},\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)2\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)2\nso \u03b2v (\u03c1) \u2208 S(C, D).\nStatement (6). Suppose v \u2208 N(C, D) and that \u03c1(v \u2217 v) 6= 0. For d \u2208 D, let \u03c31 (d) =\n\n\u03c1(v \u2217 dv)\n. Then\n\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\n\n\u03c31 \u2208 D\u0302, and for d \u2208 D, we have\nk(\u03c0\u03c1 (d) \u2212 \u03c31 (d)I)v + L\u03c1 k2\u03c1 = \u03c1(v \u2217 (d \u2212 \u03c31 (d)I)\u2217 (d \u2212 \u03c31 (d)I)v)\n= \u03c31 ((d \u2212 \u03c31 (d)I)\u2217 (d \u2212 \u03c31 (d)I))\u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 0.\nWe conclude that \u03c0\u03c1 (d)v +L\u03c1 = \u03c31 (d)v +L\u03c1 , so v +L\u03c1 is an eigenvector for \u03c0\u03c1 (D) and statement (6)\nholds.\nStatement (7). Suppose (\u03c1\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b is a net in S(C, D) and \u03c1\u03bb converges weak-\u2217 to \u03c1 \u2208 C# . Let\nv \u2208 N(C, D). If \u03c1(v) 6= 0, then for large enough \u03bb, \u03c1\u03bb (v) 6= 0. Hence |\u03c1(v)|2 = lim\u03bb |\u03c1\u03bb (v)|2 =\nlim\u03bb \u03c1\u03bb (v \u2217 v) = \u03c1(v \u2217 v). It follows that \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), so S(C, D) is weak-\u2217 closed. The continuity of\nthe restriction mapping is obvious.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.4. Statement (1) says that if v \u2208 \u2206\u03c1 , then v \u2208 M\u03c1 , where M\u03c1 = {x \u2208 C : \u03c1(xy) =\n\u03c1(yx) = \u03c1(x)\u03c1(y) \u2200 y \u2208 C}, see [2]. Also, if B is the closed linear span of \u2206\u03c1 , then B is a C \u2217 -algebra\nbecause \u2206\u03c1 is closed under multiplication. Clearly D \u2286 B, so that (B, D) is an inclusion enjoying\nthe properties of regularity or MASA inclusion when (C, D) has the same properties.\nWe turn now to the issue of existence of compatible states. When (C, D) is a regular MASA\ninclusion, Theorem 3.21, shows that every \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 extends to an element of Ss (C, D). Applying\nProposition 3.14, we see that compatible states exist in abundance for regular MASA inclusions.\nWe record this fact as a theorem.\nTheorem 4.5. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion. If \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, there exists \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) such\nthat \u03c1|D = \u03c3. Moreover, \u03c1 may be chosen so that \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, D).\nThe following result summarizes what we know regarding the existence of compatible states when\nthe hypothesis of regularity in Theorem 4.5 is weakened. Notice that in both parts of the following\nresult, a conditional expectation is present.\nTheorem 4.6. Suppose (C, D) is an inclusion.\na) If (C, D) is a MASA inclusion and there exists a conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D, then\nE # |D\u0302 is a continuous one-to-one map of D\u0302 into S(C, D).\nb) When (C, D) has the extension property (but is not necessarily regular), then E # |D\u0302 is a\nhomeomorphism of D\u0302 onto S(C, D).\n26\n\n\fProof. a) Since E is onto, E # is injective and continuous. We must show that E # carries D\u0302 into\nS(C, D).\nLet \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 and set \u03c1 = \u03c3 \u25e6 E. Suppose v \u2208 N(C, D), and \u03c1(v) 6= 0. By the Cauchy-Schwartz\nv \u2217 E(v)\n.\ninequality, \u03c1(vv \u2217 ) 6= 0. The definition of \u03c1 shows E(v) 6= 0. Let x :=\n\u03c1(vv \u2217 )\nWe claim that x commutes with D. This is easy to see when v \u2208 I(C, D). Since D is a MASA,\nProposition 2.2 gives N(C, D) = I(C, D). A continuity argument now establishes the claim.\nTherefore, x \u2208 D. Hence \u03c1(v)\u03c1(x) = \u03c1(vx) = \u03c1(vv \u2217 E(v)\u03c1(vv \u2217 )\u22121 ) = \u03c1(v), so that \u03c1(x) = 1.\nSince vx \u2208 D we obtain,\n|\u03c1(v)|2 = |\u03c1(vx)|2 = \u03c1(x\u2217 v \u2217 vx) = \u03c1(x\u2217 )\u03c1(v \u2217 v)\u03c1(x) = \u03c1(v \u2217 v).\nWe conclude that \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), as desired.\nb) Now suppose that (C, D) has the extension property. If \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), put \u03c3 = \u03c1|D . Then\n\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. By the extension property, we have \u03c1 = \u03c3 \u25e6 E, so \u03c1 = E # (\u03c3), whence E # |D\u0302 is onto. If\nE # (\u03c31 ) = E # (\u03c32 ), then the extension property yields \u03c31 = \u03c32 . So E # is a continuous bijection of\nD\u0302 onto S(C, D). Since D\u0302 and S(C, D) are both compact and Hausdorff, E # |D\u0302 is a homeomorphism.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.7. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion (we do not assume D is a MASA in C). The\nfollowing statements hold.\ni) Suppose (C1 , D1 ) is a regular MASA inclusion and \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) is a regular and\nunital \u2217-homomorphism. Then \u03b1# maps Ss (C1 , D1 ) into S(C, D).\nii) If the relative commutant Dc of D in C is abelian, then Ss (C, Dc ) \u2286 S(C, D) and the\nrestriction map \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, Dc ) 7\u2192 \u03c1|D , is a weak-\u2217\u2013weak-\u2217 continuous mapping of Ss (C, Dc )\nonto D\u0302.\nProof. We have already observed in Remark 4.2(4) that \u03b1# carries S(C1 , D1 ) into S(C, D). As\nSs (C1 , D1 ) \u2286 S(C1 , D1 ), the first statement holds.\nNow suppose that Dc is abelian. Lemma 2.3 shows that (C, Dc ) is a regular MASA inclusion\nand that the identity mapping of C onto itself is regular. By part (i), Id# carries Ss (C, Dc ) into\ncc , we\nS(C, D); thus Ss (C, Dc ) \u2286 S(C, D). As any element of D\u0302 can be extended to an element of D\nsee that the restriction map is onto. Part (7) of Proposition 4.3 gives the weak-\u2217 continuity.\n\u0003\nWe turn now to a result which shows that there are inclusions with few compatible states. In\nfact, some inclusions have no compatible states. This result applies when the relative commutant\nof D in C is all of C, e.g. (C, CI). The result shows that when N(C, D) is too large, it may happen\nthat S(C, D) is empty. For example, when C is a unital simple C \u2217 -algebra with dim(C) > 1, then\nS(C, CI) = \u2205.\nTheorem 4.8. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and let U(C) be the unitary group of C. Assume that\nU(C) \u2286 N(C, D). Then (C, D) is regular and S(C, D) is the set of all multiplicative linear functionals\non C.\nProof. Since span(U(C)) = C, (C, D) is a regular inclusion. As every multiplicative linear functional\non C is a compatible state, we need only prove that every element of S(C, D) is a multiplicative\nlinear functional.\nFix \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D). Then for every unitary U \u2208 C we have \u03c1(U ) \u2208 {0} \u222a T. Let \u03c0 be a universal\nrepresentation of C, and identify C## with the von Neumann algebra \u03c0(C)\u2032\u2032 . Also, regard C as a\nsubalgebra of C## . Let \u03c1## denote the normal state on C## obtained from \u03c1. By [33, II.4.11], every\n27\n\n\funitary in C## is the strong-\u2217 limit of a net of unitaries in C. Since \u03c1## is normal, \u03c1## (W ) \u2208 {0}\u222aT\nfor every unitary W \u2208 C## .\nLet P be a projection in C## . We shall show that \u03c1## (P ) \u2208 {0, 1}. We argue by contradiction.\nSuppose that 0 < \u03c1## (P ) < 1. Then 0 < |\u03c1## (P ) + i\u03c1## (I \u2212 P )| < 1. Put W = P + i(I \u2212 P ).\nThen W is a unitary belonging to C## , and therefore we may find a net U\u03b1 of unitaries in C so that\nU\u03b1 converges strong-\u2217 to W . But then |\u03c1(U\u03b1 )| \u2192 |\u03c1## (W )| \u2208 (0, 1). This implies that there exists\na unitary U \u2208 C such that |\u03c1(U )| \u2208 (0, 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore \u03c1## (P ) \u2208 {0, 1} for\nevery projection P \u2208 C## .\nNow let P, Q \u2208 C## be projections. We claim that \u03c1## (P Q) = \u03c1## (P )\u03c1## (Q). By the CauchySchwartz inequality, |\u03c1## (P Q)| \u2264 \u03c1## (P )\u03c1## (Q), so that \u03c1## (P Q) = 0 if 0 \u2208 {\u03c1## (P ), \u03c1## (Q)}.\nSuppose then that \u03c1## (P ) = \u03c1## (Q) = 1. Since 2P \u2212 I and 2Q \u2212 I are unitaries in C## , we may\nfind nets of unitaries u\u03b1 and v\u03b1 in C so that u\u03b1 and v\u03b1 converge \u2217-strongly to 2P \u2212 I and 2Q \u2212 I\nrespectively. Both \u03c1(u\u03b1 ) and \u03c1(v\u03b1 ) are eventually non-zero because\nlim \u03c1(u\u03b1 ) = \u03c1## (2P \u2212 I) = 1 = \u03c1## (2Q \u2212 I) = lim \u03c1(v\u03b1 ).\nAs multiplication on bounded subsets of C## is jointly continuous in the strong-\u2217 topology, u\u03b1 v\u03b1\nconverges strongly to (2P \u2212 I)(2Q \u2212 I). By Proposition 4.3(1),\n\u03c1## ((2P \u2212 I)(2Q \u2212 I)) = lim \u03c1(u\u03b1 v\u03b1 ) = lim \u03c1(u\u03b1 )\u03c1(v\u03b1 ) = \u03c1## (2P \u2212 I)\u03c1## (2Q \u2212 I) = 1.\nOn the other hand, a calculation shows that\n\u03c1## ((2P \u2212 I)(2Q \u2212 I)) = 4\u03c1## (P Q) \u2212 3.\n##\nCombining these\nPn equalities gives \u03c1 Pn(P Q) = 1, as desired. The claim follows.\nn\nLet X =\nj=1 \u03bbj Pj and Y =\nj=1 \u03bcj Qj be linear combinations of projections {Pj }j=1 and\n{Qj }nj=1 in C## . It follows from the previous paragraph that \u03c1## (XY ) = \u03c1## (X)\u03c1## (Y ). Since\nany von Neumann algebra is the norm closure of the span of its projections, \u03c1## is multiplicative\non C## . It then follows that \u03c1 is multiplicative on C.\n\u0003\n\nWe now turn to the representations arising from states in S(C, D). We begin with a simple\nlemma concerning states on regular inclusions, whose proof we leave to the reader.\nLemma 4.9. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion and suppose that \u03c1 is a state on C. Then\nspan{v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 N(C, D), \u03c1(v \u2217 v) > 0}\nis norm-dense in H\u03c1 .\nProposition 4.10. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion, let \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), and let T \u2286 \u039b\u03c1 be chosen\nso that for every v \u2208 T , \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 1 and T contains exactly one element from each \u223c\u03c1 equivalence\nclass. Then the following statements hold.\n(1) {v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 T } is an orthonormal basis for H\u03c1 .\n(2) For v \u2208 T , let Kv := {\u03be \u2208 H\u03c1 : \u03c0\u03c1 (d)\u03be = \u03c1(v \u2217 dv)\u03be for all d \u2208 D} and let \u03c3 = \u03c1|D . Then\nKv = span{w + L\u03c1 : w \u2208 T and \u03b2w (\u03c3) = \u03b2v (\u03c3)}.\n(3) For v \u2208 T , let Pv be theWorthogonal projection of H\u03c1 onto Kv . Then Pv is a minimal\nprojection in \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 and v\u2208T Pv = I.\n(4) \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is an abelian and atomic von Neumann algebra.\nProof. Statement (1). If v, w \u2208 T are distinct, then \u03c1(v \u2217 w) = 0, so that {v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 T } is\nan orthonormal set. Part (4) of Proposition 4.3 and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality show that\n28\n\n\fif v \u2208 T , and w \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 is such that v \u223c\u03c1 w, then w + L\u03c1 \u2208 span{v + L\u03c1 }. This, together with\nLemma 4.9, shows that\nspan{v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 T } = span{v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 } = span{v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 N(C, D)} = H\u03c1 .\nThus {v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 T } is an orthonormal basis for H\u03c1 .\nStatement (2). If \u03be \u2208 span{w + L\u03c1 : \u03b2w (\u03c3) = \u03b2v (\u03c3)}, Part (6) of Proposition 4.3 implies that\n\u03be \u2208 Kv . For the opposite inclusion, suppose \u03be \u2208 Kv . Then for w \u2208 T and d \u2208 D we have\n\u03b2v (\u03c3)(d) h\u03be, w + L\u03c1 i = h\u03c0\u03c1 (d)\u03be, w + L\u03c1 i = h\u03be, \u03c0\u03c1 (d\u2217 )(w + L\u03c1 )i = \u03b2w (\u03c1)(d) h\u03be, w + L\u03c1 i .\nHence if h\u03be, w + L\u03c1 i =\n6 0, then \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03b2w (\u03c3). This yields \u03be \u2208 span{w + L\u03c1 : w \u2208 T and \u03b2w (\u03c3) =\n\u03b2v (\u03c3)}.\nStatement (3). First note that forWv \u2208 T , v + L\u03c1 \u2208 Kv ; thus, since {v + L\u03c1 : v \u2208 T } is an\northonormal basis for H\u03c1 , we obtain v\u2208T Pv = I.\nLet X \u2208 \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032 and \u03be \u2208 Kv . Then for d \u2208 D,\n\u03c0\u03c1 (d)X\u03be = X\u03c0\u03c1 (d)\u03be = \u03c1(v \u2217 dv)X\u03be.\n\nTherefore X\u03be \u2208 Kv , showing that Kv is an invariant subspace for X. As this holds for every\nX \u2208 \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032 , we conclude that Pv \u2208 \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 .\nLet v \u2208 T and suppose that Q \u2208 \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a projection with 0 \u2264 Q \u2264 Pv . For all d \u2208 D we have\n\u03c0\u03c1 (d)Pv = \u03b2v (\u03c3)(d)Pv = h\u03c0\u03c1 (d)(v + L\u03c1 ), v + L\u03c1 i Pv . The Kaplansky Density Theorem shows that\nfor every X \u2208 \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 we have XPv = hX(v + L\u03c1 ), v + L\u03c1 i Pv \u2208 CPv . Since Q commutes with Pv ,\nQPv is a projection; hence QPv \u2208 {0, Pv }, so Pv is a minimal projection in \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 .\nStatement (4). This follows from statement (3).\n\u0003\nThe following result shows that elements of S(C, D) arise from regular representations \u03c0 of\n(C, D), which can be taken so that \u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 is atomic. For vectors h1 , h2 in a Hilbert space H we use\nthe notation h1 h\u22172 for the rank-one operator h 7\u2192 hh, h2 i h1 .\nTheorem 4.11. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion. The following statements hold.\ni) Let \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D). and let\nA\u03c1 := {(v + L\u03c1 )(v + L\u03c1 )\u2217 : v \u2208 N(C, D)}\u2032\u2032 \u2286 B(H\u03c1 ).\nThen A\u03c1 is an atomic MASA in B(H\u03c1 ) and \u03c0\u03c1 : (C, D) \u2192 (B(H\u03c1 ), A\u03c1 ) is a regular \u2217homomorphism.\nii) Conversely, suppose \u03c0 : C \u2192 B(H) is a regular \u2217-homomorphism with \u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 a (not necessarily atomic) MASA in B(H), and let E : B(H) \u2192 \u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 be any conditional expectation.\nThen for any pure state \u03c3 of \u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 , \u03c3 \u25e6 E \u25e6 \u03c0 \u2208 S(C, D).\nProof. For the first statement, choose T as in the statement of Proposition 4.10. For v \u2208 N(C, D),\nwe have v + L\u03c1 = 0 if v \u2208\n/ \u039b\u03c1 ; and if v + L\u03c1 6= 0, then there exists w \u2208 T such that v \u223c\u03c1 w, so\n(v + L\u03c1 )(v + L\u03c1 )\u2217 \u2208 C(w + L\u03c1 )(w + L\u03c1 )\u2217 . Since B := {w + L\u03c1 : w \u2208 T } is an orthonormal basis for\nH\u03c1 , we see that A\u03c1 is an atomic MASA in B(H\u03c1 ).\nWe now show that \u03c0\u03c1 is a regular homomorphism. Let v \u2208 N(C, D) and let w \u2208 T . Then\n\u03c0\u03c1 (v)(w + L\u03c1 )(w + L\u03c1 )\u2217 \u03c0\u03c1 (v)\u2217 = (vw + L\u03c1 )(vw + L\u03c1 )\u2217 \u2208 A\u03c1 . As span{(w + L\u03c1 )(w + L\u03c1 )\u2217 : w \u2208 T }\nis weakly dense in A\u03c1 , we conclude that \u03c0\u03c1 (v)A\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c1 (v)\u2217 \u2286 A\u03c1 . Similarly \u03c0\u03c1 (v)\u2217 A\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c1 (v) \u2286 A\u03c1 . Thus\n\u03c0\u03c1 is a regular \u2217-homomorphism.\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nFor the second statement, Theorem 4.6 shows that if \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c0\\\n\u03c1 (D) , then \u03c3 \u25e6 E \u2208 S(B(H), \u03c0(D) ).\nRemark 4.2(4) completes the proof.\n\u0003\n29\n\n\fRemark 4.12. We have \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 \u2286 A\u03c1 always, but in general they can be very different. Consider\nthe state \u03c1 = \u03c1\u221e from Example 7.17. Then, using the notation from that example, {S n +L\u03c1 : n \u2208 Z}\nis an orthonormal basis for H\u03c1 (where S n = S \u2217|n| when n < 0). Note that \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 = CI, while A\u03c1\nis a MASA.\nThe following proposition characterizes when \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 and A\u03c1 coincide. We first make a definition.\nDefinition 4.13. Let (C, D) be an inclusion and let f \u2208 Mod(C, D). The D-stabilizer of f is the\nset,\nD-stab(f ) := {v \u2208 N(C, D) : for all d \u2208 D, f (v \u2217 dv) = f (d)}.\nIf for every v \u2208 D-stab(f ) and x \u2208 C, we have f (x) = f (v \u2217 xv), then we call f a D-rigid state.\nProposition 4.14. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion, and suppose that \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D). The following\nstatements are equivalent.\n(1) \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a MASA in B(H\u03c1 ).\n(2) If v \u2208 D-stab(\u03c1), then \u03c1(v) 6= 0.\n(3) \u03c1 is a pure and D-rigid state.\nProof. Throughout the proof, we let \u03c3 = \u03c1|D , which by Proposition 4.3(2), belongs to D\u0302.\nSuppose \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a MASA in B(H\u03c1 ) and let v \u2208 D-stab(\u03c1), so v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 and \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3. Then,\nusing the notation of Proposition 4.10, we find that PI (v + L\u03c1 ) = v + L\u03c1 . Since \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a MASA,\nPI is the orthogonal projection onto C(I + L\u03c1 ). We conclude that v + L\u03c1 is a non-zero scalar\nmultiple of I + L\u03c1 . Hence 0 6= hv + L\u03c1 , I + L\u03c1 i = \u03c1(v). Thus v \u2208 \u2206\u03c1 , so statement (1) implies\nstatement (2).\nBefore proving the next implication, we pause for some generalities. Suppose that f is any state\non C with the property that f |D = \u03c3. If v \u2208 N(C, D) and f (v \u2217 v) = 0, then the Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality yields f (v) = 0. Also note that if v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 satisfies \u03b2v (\u03c3) 6= \u03c3, then f (v) = 0. Indeed, for\nsuch v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 , choose d \u2208 D so that \u03b2v (\u03c3)(d) = 0 and \u03c3(d) = 1. Then as v \u2217 dv \u2208 D,\n0 = f (v \u2217 dv) = f (v)f (v \u2217 dv) = f (vv \u2217 dv) = f (dvv \u2217 v) = f (d)f (v)f (v \u2217 v).\nAs f (d) and f (v \u2217 v) are both non-zero, we conclude that f (v) = 0.\nNow suppose statement (2) holds. We first prove that \u03c1 is pure. So suppose that t \u2208 [0, 1] and\nthat for i = 1, 2, \u03c1i are states on C and \u03c1 = t\u03c11 + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c12 . As \u03c1|D is a pure state on D, we have\n\u03c1i |D = \u03c3. We claim that for every v \u2208 N(C, D), \u03c11 (v) = \u03c12 (v) = \u03c1(v). By the previous paragraph,\nit remains only to prove this for v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 such that \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3. So suppose v has this property. By\nthe hypothesis in statement (2), \u03c1(v) 6= 0. Clearly |\u03c1i (v)| \u2264 \u03c1i (v \u2217 v)1/2 = \u03c1(v \u2217 v)1/2 = |\u03c1(v)|. Thus\nwe have\n\u03c12 (v)\n\u03c11 (v)\n+ (1 \u2212 t)\n= 1,\nt\n\u03c1(v)\n\u03c1(v)\nwhich expresses 1 as a convex combination of elements of the closed unit disk. Hence \u03c1i (v) = \u03c1(v),\nestablishing the claim. By regularity, we conclude that \u03c11 = \u03c12 = \u03c1, so \u03c1 is a pure state.\nNext, if v \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 and \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03c3, then by hypothesis, \u03c1(v) 6= 0. So the final part of statement (3)\nfollows from part (1) of Proposition 4.3. Thus statement (2) implies statement (3).\nFinally, suppose that statement (3) holds. Let v, w \u2208 \u039b\u03c1 be such that \u03b2v (\u03c3) = \u03b2w (\u03c3). We shall\nshow that {v +L\u03c1 , w+L\u03c1 } is a linearly dependent set, showing that Kv is one-dimensional. We have\n\u03c1(v \u2217 wxw\u2217 v)\n\u03b2w\u2217 v (\u03c3) = \u03c3 = \u03b2v\u2217 w (\u03c3), so \u03c1(v \u2217 ww\u2217 v)\u22121/2 w\u2217 v \u2208 D-stab(\u03c1). By hypothesis, \u03c1(x) =\n\u03c1(v \u2217 ww\u2217 v)\nfor every x \u2208 C. Thus if \u03b7 = \u03c1(v \u2217 ww\u2217 v)\u22121/2 w\u2217 v + L\u03c1 , we have h\u03c0\u03c1 (x)\u03b7, \u03b7i = h\u03c0\u03c1 (x)(I + L\u03c1 ), I + L\u03c1 i\nfor every x \u2208 C. Since \u03c1 is pure, \u03c0\u03c1 (C)\u2032\u2032 = B(H\u03c1 ), so that for every T \u2208 B(H\u03c1 ) we obtain\nhT \u03b7, \u03b7i = hT (I + L\u03c1 ), I + L\u03c1 i .\n30\n\n\fHence {\u03b7, I + L\u03c1 } is a linearly dependent set. Thus, {w\u2217 v + L\u03c1 , I + L\u03c1 } is linearly dependent.\nSince both vectors in this set are non-zero, we find 0 6= hw\u2217 v + L\u03c1 , I + L\u03c1 i = \u03c1(w\u2217 v). Applying\npart (4) of Proposition 4.3 and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we obtain {v + L\u03c1 , w + L\u03c1 } is\nlinearly dependent, as desired.\nAs Kv is one-dimensional, Proposition 4.10 implies that \u03c0\u03c1 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a MASA.\n\u0003\n5. The D-Radical and Embedding Theorems\nOur purpose in this section is to prove two embedding theorems. The first characterizes when\na regular inclusion can be regularly embedded into a regular MASA inclusion, while the second\ncharacterizes when a regular inclusion may be regularly embedded into a C \u2217 -diagonal.\nThe first of these theorems shows that the obvious necessary condition suffices.\nTheorem 5.1. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion. The following statements are equivalent.\na) There exists a regular MASA inclusion (C1 , D1 ) and a regular \u2217-monomorphism \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192\n(C1 , D1 ).\nb) The relative commutant Dc of D in C is abelian.\nProof. Suppose that (C1 , D1 ) is a regular MASA inclusion and \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) is a regular\n\u2217-monomorphism. Let (I(D1 ), \u03b91 ) be an injective envelope for D1 and let E1 : C1 \u2192 I(C1 ) be the\npseudo-expectation for \u03b91 .\nObserve that (Dc , D) is a regular inclusion, and N(Dc , D) \u2286 N(C, D). Let \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C1 , D1 ).\nPart (i) of Theorem 4.7 shows that \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b1 \u2208 S(C, D), and hence \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b1|Dc \u2208 S(Dc , D). Theorem 4.8\nimplies \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b1|Dc is a multiplicative linear functional on Dc . By the definition of Ss (C1 , D1 ), we see\nc\n\\\nthat for every \u03c4 \u2208 I(D\n1 ), \u03c4 \u25e6 E1 \u25e6 \u03b1|Dc is a multiplicative linear functional on D . We conclude\nE1 \u25e6 \u03b1|Dc is a \u2217-homomorphism of Dc into I(D1 ).\nLet u \u2208 Dc be a unitary element. Clearly, u \u2208 N(C, D), so regularity of \u03b1 implies that \u03b1(u) \u2208\nN(C1 , D1 ). Let J\u03b1(u) be the ideal of D1 as defined in (7). Since E1 (\u03b1(u)) is unitary, Theorem 3.10(c)\nshows supI(D1 ) (\u03b9(J\u03b1(u) )+\n1 ) is the identity of I(D1 ). Hence J\u03b1(u) is an essential ideal in D1 . Then\n\u25e6\n(fix \u03b2\u03b1(u) ) is dense in D\u03021 by Proposition 3.2. As dom(\u03b2\u03b1(u) ) = D\u03021 , we get D\u03021 = (fix \u03b2\u03b1(u) )\u25e6 =\nfix \u03b2\u03b1(u) . Therefore, D\u03021 = (fix \u03b2\u03b1(u) )\u25e6 . Another application of Proposition 3.2 gives J\u03b1(u) = D1 ,\nand hence \u03b1(u) \u2208 D1 . This shows that the image of the unitary group of Dc under \u03b1 is abelian.\nSince \u03b1 is faithful, we see that the unitary group of Dc is abelian, and hence Dc is abelian.\nFor the converse, take \u03b1 to be the identity map on C. Lemma 2.3 shows that \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C, Dc )\nis regular, so statement (a) follows from statement (b).\n\u0003\nQuestion 5.2. When does a regular inclusion regularly embed into a regular EP-inclusion?\nWe conjecture that the conditions of Theorem 5.1 also characterize when a regular inclusion may\nbe regularly embedded into a regular EP-inclusion. Here is an approach to this problem. Suppose\n(C, D) is a regular inclusion with Dc abelian. Let \u03c0 : C \u2192 B(H) be a faithful representation of C,\nlet D1 = \u03c0(Dc )\u2032\u2032 and let C1 be the (concrete) C \u2217 -algebra generated by \u03c0(C) and D1 . Then (C1 , D1 )\nis regular, and \u03c0 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) is a regular \u2217-monomorphism. If D1 is a MASA in C1 , then\nTheorem 2.10 shows that (C1 , D1 ) is an EP-inclusion. Unfortunately, we have not been able to\ndecide whether the faithful represetation \u03c0 can be chosen so that (C1 , D1 ) is a MASA inclusion.\nWe now define a certain ideal, the D-radical of an inclusion, and show its relevance to embedding\nregular inclusions into C \u2217 -diagonals.\nDefinition 5.3. For an inclusion (C, D), the D-radical of (C, D) is the set\nRad(C, D) := {x \u2208 C : k\u03c0\u03c1 (x)k = 0 for all \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D)},\n31\n\n\fprovided S(C, D) 6= \u2205; otherwise define Rad(C, D) = C. (Note that Rad(C, D) 6= C whenever (C, D)\nis a regular MASA inclusion.)\nWhen (C, D) is a regular inclusion, we have the following description of Rad(C, D).\nProposition 5.4. Suppose that (C, D) is a regular inclusion. Then\nRad(C, D) = {x \u2208 C : \u03c1(x\u2217 x) = 0 for all \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D)}.\nProof. Let J := {x \u2208 C : \u03c1(x\u2217 x) = 0 for all \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D)}. If x \u2208 Rad(C, D) and \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), then\n\u03c1(x\u2217 x) = k\u03c0\u03c1 (x)(I + L\u03c1 )k = 0, and we find that Rad(C, D) \u2286 J. For the opposite inclusion, let\nx \u2208 J. Part (5) of Proposition 4.3 and Corollary 2.16 show that J is a closed, two-sided ideal of\nC. Hence for every c \u2208 C and \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) we have \u03c1(c\u2217 x\u2217 xc) = 0, which means that \u03c0\u03c1 (x) = 0 for\nevery \u03c1. So x \u2208 Rad(C, D), showing Rad(C, D) = J.\n\u0003\nExamples 5.5. Here are some examples of the D-radical.\n(1) By Proposition 5.7, Rad(C, D) = (0) for any Cartan inclusion.\n(2) Suppose that (C, D) is a regular EP inclusion. Then Rad(C, D) is the left kernel of the\nassociated conditional expectation E, that is, Rad(C, D) = {x \u2208 C : E(x\u2217 x) = 0}. This\nfollows from Propositions 5.4 and 4.6.\n(3) Suppose that (C, D) is an inclusion such that U(C) \u2286 N(C, D). Then Theorem 4.8 shows\nthat S(C, D) is the set of characters on C. Since the intersection of the kernels of all\ncharacters is the commutator ideal, it follows from Proposition 5.4 that Rad(C, D) is the\ncommutator ideal of C.\nQuestion 5.6. Observe that when (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, Rad(C, D) \u2286 L(C, D),\nbecause Ss (C, D) \u2286 S(C, D). Is it possible for the inclusion to be proper?\nProposition 5.7. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion and suppose (C1 , D1 ) is a regular MASA inclusion. If \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) is a regular and unital \u2217-homomorphism, then Rad(C, D) \u2286\n\u03b1\u22121 (L(C1 , D1 )).\nProof. By Theorem 4.7, \u03b1(Rad(C, D)) \u2286 L(C1 , D1 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that when L(C1 , D1 ) = (0), Proposition 5.7 implies that Rad(C, D) \u2286 ker \u03b1. We have\nbeen unable to decide whether equality holds in general. However, the following lemma shows that\none can construct a C \u2217 -diagonal and a regular \u2217-homomorphism such that equality holds.\nLemma 5.8. Suppose that (C, D) is a regular inclusion. Then there exists a C \u2217 -diagonal (C1 , D1 )\nand a regular \u2217-homomorphism \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C, D1 ) with ker \u03b1 = Rad(C, D).\nProof.L\nFor each \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D), letL\n(\u03c0\u03c1 , H\u03c1 ) be the GNS representation of C arising from \u03c1. Let\nH := \u03c1\u2208S(C,D) H\u03c1 and let D1 = \u03c1\u2208S(C,D) A\u03c1 , where A\u03c1 is as in the statement of Theorem 4.11.\nAs A\u03c1 is an atomic MASA in B(H\u03c1 ), we see that D1 is an atomic MASA in B(H). Let C1 =\nspanN(B(H), D1 ). By Theorem 2.10 and the fact that the expectation onto an atomic MASA in\nB(H) is faithful, (C1 , D1 ) is a C \u2217 -diagonal.\nL\nFor each v \u2208 N(C, D), the regularity of \u03c0\u03c1 (Theorem 4.11) shows that\n\u03c1\u2208S(C,D) \u03c0\u03c1 (v) \u2208\nL\nN(B(H), D1 ). Hence for each x \u2208 C, \u03c1\u2208S(C,D) \u03c0\u03c1 (x) \u2208 C1 . Thus if \u03b1 : C \u2192 C1 is given by \u03b1(x) =\nL\n\u0003\n\u03c1\u2208S(C,D) \u03c0\u03c1 (x), then \u03b1 is a regular \u2217-homomorphism. By construction, ker \u03b1 = Rad(C, D).\nThe following is our main embedding result.\n\nTheorem 5.9. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion. Then there exists a C \u2217 -diagonal (C1 , D1 ) and a\nregular \u2217-monomorphism \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) if and only if Rad(C, D) = 0.\n32\n\n\fProof. Suppose that (C1 , D1 ) is a C \u2217 -diagonal and \u03b1 : (C, D) \u2192 (C1 , D1 ) is a regular \u2217-monomorphism.\nSince L(C1 , D1 ) = (0), Proposition 5.7 gives Rad(C, D) \u2286 ker \u03b1 = (0).\nThe converse follows from Lemma 5.8.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.10. Suppose that (C, D) is an inclusion such that U(C) \u2286 N(C, D). Then there is a\nregular \u2217-monomorphism of (C, D) into a C \u2217 -diagonal if and only if C is abelian.\nProof. Since the commutator ideal is the intersection of the kernels of all multiplicative linear\nfunctionals, the result follows directly from Theorem 4.8 and Example 5.5(3).\n\u0003\n6. An Example: Reduced Crossed Products by Discrete Groups\nIn this section we consider the regular inclusion (C, D), where C = D \u22car \u0393 is the reduced crossed\nproduct of the unital abelian C \u2217 -algebra D = C(X) by a discrete group \u0393 of homeomorphisms of\nX.\nThe main results of this section are: Theorem 6.6, which characterizes when the relative commutant Dc of D in D \u22car \u0393 is abelian in terms of the associated dynamical system; Theorem 6.9, which\nshows that when Dc is abelian, L(D \u22car \u0393, Dc ) = (0); and a summary result, Theorem 6.10 which\ngives a number of characterizations for when (D \u22car \u0393, D) regularly embeds into a C \u2217 -diagonal. By\nchoosing the space X and group \u0393 appropriately, the methods in this section can be used to produce\nan example of a virtual Cartan inclusion (C, D) where C is not nuclear, see [6, Theorem 4.4.3 or\nTheorem 5.1.6].\nSome of the results in this section complement results from [32].\nWe begin by establishing our notation. This is standard material, but we include it because\nthere are a number of variations in the literature.\nThroughout, let X be a compact Hausdorff space, let \u0393 be a discrete group with unit element\ne acting on X as homeomorphisms of X. Thus there is a homomorphism \u039e of \u0393 into the group\nof homeomorphisms of X, and for (s, x) \u2208 \u0393 \u00d7 X, we will write sx instead of \u039e(s)(x). We will\nsometimes refer to the pair (X, \u0393) as a discrete dynamical system. For s \u2208 \u0393, let \u03b1s \u2208 Aut(C(X))\nbe given by\n(\u03b1s (f ))(x) = f (s\u22121 x),\nf \u2208 C(X), x \u2208 X.\nIf Y is any set, and z \u2208 Y , we use \u03b4z to denote the characteristic function of the singleton set\n{z}.\nLet D = C(X), and let Cc (\u0393, D) be the set of all functions a : \u0393 \u2192 D such that {s \u2208 \u0393 : a(s) 6= 0}\nis a finite set. We will sometimes write a(s, x) for the value of a(s) at x \u2208 X instead of a(s)(x).\nThen Cc (\u0393, D) is a \u2217-algebra under the usual twisted convolution product and adjoint operation:\nfor a, b \u2208 Cc (\u0393, D),\nX\na(r)\u03b1r (b(r \u22121 t)) and (a\u2217 )(t) = \u03b1t (a(t\u22121 ))\u2217 .\n(ab)(t) =\nr\u2208\u0393\n\nLet C = C(X) \u22car \u0393 be the reduced crossed product of C(X) by \u0393.\nThe group\n( \u0393 is naturally embedded into C via s 7\u2192 ws , where ws is the element of Cc (\u0393, D) given\n0 if t 6= s\nby ws (t) =\nAlso, D is embedded into Cc (\u0393, D) via the map d 7\u2192 dwe and we identify\nI if t = s.\nD with its image under this map. Now ws dws\u22121 = \u03b1s (d) and span{dws : d \u2208 D, s \u2208 \u0393} is norm\ndense in C, so {ws : s \u2208 \u0393} \u2286 N(C, D). Thus (C, D) is a regular inclusion.\nIt is well known (see for example, the discussion of crossed products in [6]) that the map E :\nCc (\u0393, D) \u2192 D given by E(a) = a(e) extends to a faithful conditional expectation E of C onto D.\n33\n\n\fLikewise, the maps Es : Cc (\u0393, D) \u2192 D given by Es (a) = a(s) extend to norm-one linear mappings\nEs of C onto D. Notice that for a \u2208 C and s \u2208 \u0393,\nEs (a) = E(aws\u22121 ).\n\nP\nThe maps Es allow a useful \"Fourier series\" viewpoint for elements of C: a \u223c s\u2208\u0393 Es (a)ws .\nThe following is well-known. We sketch a proof for convenience of the reader.\nProposition 6.1. If a \u2208 C and Es (a) = 0 for every s \u2208 \u0393, then a = 0.\n\nProof. For a \u2208 Cc (\u0393, D) and s, t \u2208 \u0393, a calculation shows that\nEs (wt awt\u22121 ) = \u03b1t (Et\u22121 st (a));\n\n(22)\n\na continuity argument then shows that (22) actually holds for every a \u2208 C.\nLet J = {a \u2208 C : Et (a) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 \u0393}. Clearly J is closed. Then (22) shows that if a \u2208 J and\ns \u2208 \u0393, then ws aws\u22121 \u2208 J. Easy calculations now show that if d \u2208 D, s \u2208 \u0393 and a \u2208 J, then\n{da, ad, ws a, aws } \u2286 J, and by taking linear combinations and closures, we find that J is a closed\ntwo-sided ideal of C. Thus, if a \u2208 J, a\u2217 a \u2208 J, so that Ee (a\u2217 a) = E(a\u2217 a) = 0. Hence a = 0 by\nfaithfulness of E. This shows that J = (0), completing the proof.\n\u0003\nDefinition 6.2. We make the following definitions.\n(1) For s \u2208 \u0393, let Fs = {x \u2208 X : sx = x} be the set of fixed points of s.\n(2) For s \u2208 \u0393, let Fs = {f \u2208 D : supp(f )) \u2286 Fs\u25e6 }. Thus {Fs : s \u2208 \u0393} is a family of closed ideals\nin D.\n(3) For x \u2208 X, let \u0393x := {s \u2208 \u0393 : sx = x} be the isotropy group at x.\n(4) For x \u2208 X, let H x := {s \u2208 \u0393 : x \u2208 (Fs )\u25e6 }. We will call H x the germ isotropy group at x.\nRemarks. We chose the terminology 'germ isotropy' because s \u2208 H x if and only if the homeomorphisms s and id|X agree in a neighborhood of x, that is, they have the same germ. It is easy to see\nthat H x is a group; in fact, H x is a normal subgroup of \u0393x . To see that H x is a normal subgroup\nof \u0393x , fix x \u2208 X and let s \u2208 H x . Then there exists an open neighborhood V of x such that V \u2286 Fs .\nLet t \u2208 \u0393x and put W = t\u22121 V . Since tx = x, x \u2208 W . For y \u2208 W , ty \u2208 V , so sty = ty. Hence\nt\u22121 sty = y. Therefore, W \u2286 Ft\u22121 st . As W is open and x \u2208 W , we see that x belongs to the interior\nof Ft\u22121 st , so t\u22121 st \u2208 H x as desired.\nSimple examples show the inclusion of H x in \u0393x can be proper.\nWe record a description of the relative commutant of D in C.\nProposition 6.3. We have\nDc = {a \u2208 C : \u03b1s (d)Es (a) = dEs (a) for all d \u2208 D and all s \u2208 \u0393}\n= {a \u2208 C : Es (a) \u2208 Fs for all s \u2208 \u0393}.\nProof. A computation shows that for a \u2208 C, d \u2208 D and s \u2208 \u0393,\n(23)\n\nEs (da \u2212 ad) = (d \u2212 \u03b1s (d))Es (a).\n\nThus if a \u2208 Dc , we obtain \u03b1s (d)Es (a) = dEs (a) for every d \u2208 D and s \u2208 \u0393. Conversely, if\nEs (a)\u03b1s (d) = dEs (a) for every d \u2208 D and s \u2208 \u0393, Proposition 6.1 gives a \u2208 Dc .\nFor the second equality, suppose that a \u2208 C and Es (a) \u2208 Fs for every s \u2208 \u0393. Since Es (a)\nis supported in Fs\u25e6 , an examination of (23) shows that Es (da \u2212 ad) = 0 for every d \u2208 D. By\nProposition 6.1 again, a \u2208 Dc . For the reverse inclusion, suppose that a \u2208 Dc . Then for d \u2208 D\nand s \u2208 \u0393, 0 = (d \u2212 \u03b1s (d))Es (a). Thus if x \u2208 X and Es (a)(x) 6= 0, we have d(x) \u2212 d(s\u22121 x) = 0 for\nevery d \u2208 D. It follows that the support of Es (a) is contained in Fs . But supp(Es (a)) is open, so\nthe reverse inclusion holds.\n\u0003\n34\n\n\fWe now describe a representation useful for establishing certain formulae.\nThe very discrete representation. Let H = l2 (\u0393 \u00d7 X). Then {\u03b4(t,y) : (t, y) \u2208 \u0393 \u00d7 X} is an\northonormal basis for H. For f \u2208 C(X), s \u2208 \u0393, and \u03be \u2208 H, define representations \u03c0 of C(X) and\nU of \u0393 on H by\n(\u03c0(f )\u03be)(t, y) = f (ty)\u03be(t, y) and (Us \u03be)(t, y) = \u03be(s\u22121 t, y).\nIn particular,\n\u03c0(f )\u03b4(t,y) = f (ty)\u03b4(t,y) and Us \u03b4(t,y) = \u03b4(st,y) .\nThe\ngenerated by the images of \u03c0 and U is isometrically isomorphic to the reduced\ncrossed product of C(X) by \u0393 (see [6, pages 117-118]), and hence determines a faithful representation \u03b8 : C \u2192 B(H).\nA computation shows that for a \u2208 C, t, r \u2208 \u0393 and x, y \u2208 X,\n(\n0\nif x 6= y;\n\u03b8(a)\u03b4(t,y) , \u03b4(r,x) =\nErt\u22121 (a)(ry) if x = y.\nC \u2217 -algebra\n\nAlso for a \u2208 C, t \u2208 \u0393 and y \u2208 X, we have\n(24)\n\n\u03b8(a)\u03b4(t,y) =\n\nX\n\nEs (a)(sty)\u03b4(st,y) .\n\ns\u2208\u0393\n\nWe now define some notation. Let \u03bb : \u0393 \u2192 B(l2 (\u0393)) be the left regular representation, and\nfor x \u2208 X, regard l2 (H x ) as a subspace of l2 (\u0393). Then Cr\u2217 (H x ) is the C \u2217 -algebra generated by\n{\u03bbs |l2 (H x ) : s \u2208 H x }. Define Vx : l2 (H x ) \u2192 H by\n(\n0\nif (s, y) \u2208\n/ H x \u00d7 {x}\n(Vx \u03b7)(s, y) =\n\u03b7(s) if (s, y) \u2208 H x \u00d7 {x}.\nThen for r \u2208 H x , we have Vx \u03b4r = \u03b4(r,x) , so Vx is an isometry.\nProposition 6.4. For x \u2208 X and a \u2208 C, define \u03a6x (a) := Vx\u2217 \u03b8(a)Vx . Then \u03a6x is a completely\npositive unital mapping of C onto Cr\u2217 (H x ) and \u03a6x |Dc is a \u2217-epimorphism of Dc onto Cr\u2217 (H x ).\nProof. Clearly \u03a6x is completely positive and unital. For d \u2208 D, r \u2208 \u0393 and s, t \u2208 H x we have\n(25)\n\nh\u03a6x (dwr )\u03b4s , \u03b4t i = hVx\u2217 \u03b8(dwr )Vx \u03b4s , \u03b4t i = \u03c0(d)Ur \u03b4(s,x) , \u03b4(t,x)\n= \u03c0(d)\u03b4(rs,x) , \u03b4(t,x) = d(rsx) \u03b4(rs,x) , \u03b4(t,x) = d(rx) h\u03b4rs , \u03b4t i\n= d(rx) h\u03bbr \u03b4s , \u03b4t i .\n\nHence for every d \u2208 D and r \u2208 \u0393,\n(26)\n\n\u03a6x (dwr ) =\n\n(\n\n0\nd(x)\u03bbr |l2 (H x )\n\nif r \u2208\n/ H x,\nif r \u2208 H x .\n\nTherefore \u03a6x maps a set of generators for C into Cr\u2217 (H x ), giving \u03a6x (C) \u2286 Cr\u2217 (H x ).\nTo show that \u03a6x |Dc is a \u2217-homomorphism, it suffices to prove that the range of Vx is an invariant\nsubspace for \u03b8(Dc ). Note that range(Vx ) = span{\u03b4(t,x) : t \u2208 H x }. Let a \u2208 Dc and fix t \u2208 H x . We\nclaim that if s \u2208 \u0393, d \u2208 Fs and stx \u2208 supp(d), then s \u2208 H x . Indeed, suppose that stx \u2208 supp(d).\nAs t \u2208 H x , stx = sx. So sx \u2208 Fs\u25e6 = Fs\u25e6\u22121 , which yields x \u2208 Fs\u25e6 . Thus s \u2208 H x , so the claim holds.\nNext by (24) and Proposition 6.3, for t \u2208 H x , we have\nX\nX\n\u03b8(a)\u03b4(t,x) =\nEs (a)(stx)\u03b4(st,x) =\nEs (a)(stx)\u03b4(st,x) \u2208 range(Vx ),\ns\u2208\u0393\n\ns\u2208H x\n\nas desired. It follows that \u03a6x |Dc is a \u2217-homomorphism.\n35\n\n\fIt remains to show \u03a6x (Dc ) = Cr\u2217 (H x ). If s \u2208 H x , let d \u2208 Fs be such that d(x) = 1, and\nput a = dws . Then (26) shows that \u03a6x (a) = \u03bbs |l2 (H x ) . By Proposition 6.3, a \u2208 Dc , and hence\n\u03a6x (Dc ) is dense in Cr\u2217 (H x ). Since \u03a6x |Dc is a homomorphism, it has closed range. Therefore\n\u03a6x (Dc ) = Cr\u2217 (H x ).\n\u0003\nLet\n\nL\n\nM\n\nCr\u2217 (H x ) :=\n\nx\u2208X\nx\n\u2217\nx\u2208X Cr (H ),\n\n(\n\nf\u2208\n\nY\n\nCr\u2217 (H x ) : sup kf (x)k < \u221e\nx\u2208X\n\nx\u2208X\n\n)\n\ndefine kf k = supx\u2208X\nand for f \u2208\nL kf (x)k. Then with product, addition, scalar\nmultiplication and involution defined point-wise, x\u2208X Cr\u2217 (H x ) is a C \u2217 -algebra.\nL\nCorollary 6.5. The map \u03a6 : C \u2192 x\u2208X Cr\u2217 (H x ) given by \u03a6(a)(x) = \u03a6x (a) is a faithful completely\npositive unital mapping such that \u03a6|Dc is a \u2217-monomorphism.\nProof. It follows from the definition of \u03a6x that \u03a6 is unital and completely positive. Proposition 6.4\nshows that \u03a6|Dc is a \u2217-homomorphism; it remains to check that \u03a6 is faithful.\nFor x \u2208 X, let trx be the the trace on Cr\u2217 (H x ). For d \u2208 D and s \u2208 \u0393 equation (26) gives,\n(\n)\n0\nif s 6= e\ntrx (\u03a6x (dws )) =\n= E(dws )(x).\nd(x) if s = e\nThis formula extends by linearity and continuity, so that for a \u2208 C, trx (\u03a6x (a)) = E(a)(x). So if\na \u2265 0 belongs to C and \u03a6(a) = 0, then E(a) = 0, so a = 0. Thus, \u03a6 is faithful.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.6. The relative commutant, Dc , of D in C is abelian if and only if H x is an abelian\ngroup for every x \u2208 X.\nProof. Corollary 6.5 shows that if H x is abelian for every x \u2208 X, then Dc is abelian.\nFor the converse, we prove the contrapositive. Suppose that H x is non-abelian for some x \u2208 X.\nFix s, t \u2208 H x so that st 6= ts. Then x \u2208 (Fs )\u25e6 \u2229 (Ft )\u25e6 , so we may find d \u2208 D so that d(x) = 1 and\nsupp(d) \u2286 (Fs )\u25e6 \u2229 (Ft )\u25e6 . Then for h \u2208 D and z \u2208 X we have (by examining the cases z \u2208 Fs and\nz\u2208\n/ Fs ),\n(\u03b1s (h)(z) \u2212 h(z))d(z) = (h(s\u22121 z) \u2212 h(z))d(z) = 0.\nProposition 6.3 shows that dws \u2208 Dc . Likewise, dwt \u2208 Dc .\nThen dws dwt = d\u03b1s (d)wst . Note that by choice of d, s supp(d) = supp(d). For z \u2208 X,\n(\n0\nif z \u2208\n/ supp(d)\n\u22121\n\u03b1s (d)(z) = d(s z) =\nd(z) if z \u2208 supp(d).\nThus, \u03b1s (d) = d, and likewise, \u03b1t (d) = d. Therefore,\n(dws )(dwt ) = d2 wst 6= d2 wts = (dwt )(dws ),\nso Dc is not abelian.\n\u0003\nProposition 6.7. Let (X, \u0393) be a discrete dynamical system such that for each x \u2208 X, the germ\nisotropy group H x is abelian. Let \u03931 \u2286 \u0393 be a subgroup of \u0393, set\nC1 := D \u22car \u03931 ,\n\nand let\n\nD1 = {x \u2208 C1 : xd = dx for all d \u2208 D}.\n\nThen (C1 , D1 ) is a regular MASA inclusion and C1 \u2229 L(C, Dc ) \u2286 L(C1 , D1 ).\n36\n\n\fProof. As D1 \u2286 Dc , D1 is abelian, and as D1 is the relative commutant of D in C1 , (C1 , D1 ) is\na regular MASA inclusion. Let \u01eb : C1 \u2192 C be the inclusion map. Notice that each map in the\ndiagram,\n(C1 , D1 )\n\n\u01eb\n\n/ (C, D1 )\n\nid\n\n/ (C, Dc )\n\nis a regular map. The first is clearly regular, while the regularity of the second follows from the\nfact that the relative commutant of D1 in C is Dc and an application of Lemma 2.3. Therefore,\n\u01eb : (C1 , D1 ) \u2192 (C, Dc ) is a regular \u2217-monomorphism. An application of Corollary 3.23 completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nNotation 6.8. When G is an abelian group with dual group \u011c, we use the notation hg, \u03b3i to\ndenote the value of \u03b3 \u2208 \u011c at g \u2208 G. Also, we will identify C \u2217 (G) with C(\u011c); lastly, for \u03b3 \u2208 \u011c and\na \u2208 C \u2217 (G), we will write \u03b3(a) instead of \u00e2(\u03b3).\nTheorem 6.9. Suppose that (X, \u0393) is a discrete dynamical system such that for each x \u2208 X, the\ngerm isotropy group H x is abelian. Then L(C, Dc ) = (0).\nProof. First assume that \u0393 is a countable discrete group. Let\nY\ncx\nH\nP =\nx\u2208X\n\nbe the Cartesian product of the dual groups. Denote by p(x) the \"x-th component\" of p \u2208 P . For\n(x, p) \u2208 X \u00d7 P , define a state \u03c1(x,p) on C by\n\u03c1(x,p) (a) = p(x) (\u03a6x (a))\n\n(here a \u2208 C),\n\nand let\n\nA := {\u03c1(x,p) : (x, p) \u2208 X \u00d7 P }.\n\nDc\n\nCorollary 6.5 shows that the restriction of \u03c1(x,p) to\nis a multiplicative linear functional, so in\nparticular, A \u2286 Mod(C, Dc ).\nFor each s \u2208 \u0393, let\nXs := (X \\ Fs ) \u222a Fs\u25e6 .\nThen Xs is a dense, open subset of X. Set\n\\\nY :=\nXs and B := {\u03c1(y,p) : (y, p) \u2208 Y \u00d7 P }.\ns\u2208\u0393\n\nOur goal is to show that\n\nB \u2286 Ss (C, Dc ).\n\n(27)\n\nFix (y, p) \u2208 Y \u00d7 P , and suppose that \u03c4 \u2208 Mod(C, Dc ) satisfies \u03c1(y,p) |Dc = \u03c4 |Dc . We claim that\n\u03c1(y,p) = \u03c4 . To see this, it suffices to show that for each s \u2208 \u0393, \u03c1(y,p) (ws ) = \u03c4 (ws ). Given s \u2208 \u0393, if\nsy 6= y, we may choose d \u2208 D so that d(sy) = 1 and d(y) = 0. Using (26),\n\u03c1(y,p) (d) = p(y)(\u03a6y (d)) = 0\n\nand \u03c1(y,p) (ws\u2217 dws ) = \u03c1(y,p) (\u03b1s\u22121 (d)) = p(y)(d(sy)I) = 1.\n\nThen\n\u03c1(y,p) (ws ) = \u03c1(y,p) (ws )\u03c1(y,p) (ws\u2217 dws ) = \u03c1(y,p) (ws (ws\u2217 dws )) = \u03c1(y,p) (d)\u03c1(y,p) (ws ) = 0.\nLikewise, \u03c4 (ws ) = 0, so \u03c4 (ws ) = \u03c1(y,p) (ws ) = 0 when y \u2208\n/ Fs .\nOn the other hand, if sy = y, then as y \u2208 Xs , we have y \u2208 Fs\u25e6 , so s \u2208 H y . Choose d \u2208 D so that\n\u02c6 = 1 and supp d\u02c6 \u2286 F \u25e6 . Then dws \u2208 Dc , so that\nd(y)\ns\n\u03c1(p,y) (ws ) = \u03c1(y,p) (dws ) = \u03c4 (dws ) = \u03c4 (ws ).\nTherefore, \u03c1(p,y) = \u03c4 .\nLet U(C, Dc ) = {\u03c4 \u2208 Mod(C, Dc ) : \u03c4 |Dc extends uniquely to C}. The previous paragraph shows\nthat B \u2286 U(C, Dc ). By Theorem 3.13, B \u2286 U(C, Dc ) = Ss (C, Dc ), so (27) holds.\n37\n\n\fSuppose now that a \u2208 L(C, Dc ). Then for every \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, Dc ), we have \u03c1(a\u2217 a) = 0. In particular,\nfor each (y, p) \u2208 Y \u00d7 P ,\n0 = \u03c1(y,p) (a\u2217 a) = p(y) (\u03a6y (a\u2217 a)) .\ncy = {p(y) : p \u2208 P }, so holding y fixed and varying p, yields \u03a6y (a\u2217 a) = 0. Hence, we\nNow H\nhave Ee (a\u2217 a)(y) = E(a\u2217 a)(y) = 0 for every y \u2208 Y . By Baire's theorem, Y is dense in X, so that\nE(a\u2217 a) = 0. Since E is faithful, a = 0. This gives the theorem in the case when \u0393 is countable.\nWe turn now to the general case. Let \u0393 be any discrete group and suppose a \u2208 L(C, Dc ). Then\nthere exists a countable subgroup \u03931 \u2286 \u0393 such that a \u2208 D \u22car \u03931 . Put C1 = D \u22car \u03931 and let\nD1 = {x \u2208 C1 : dx = xd for all d \u2208 D} be the relative commutant of D in C1 . By Proposition 6.7,\nwe have a \u2208 L(C1 , D1 ) = (0). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe collect the main results of this section into a main theorem.\nTheorem 6.10. Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let \u0393 be a discrete group acting as\nhomeomorphisms on X. Let C = C(X) \u22car \u0393 and D = C(X). The following statements are\nequivalent.\na) For every x \u2208 X, the germ isotropy group H x is abelian;\nb) The relative commutant, Dc , of D in C is abelian;\nc) L(C, Dc ) = (0);\nd) (C, D) regularly embeds into a C \u2217 -diagonal.\nProof. Theorem 6.6 gives the equivalence of (a) and (b) and Theorem 6.9 shows that (a) implies\n(c).\nSuppose (c) holds. Since Rad(C, Dc ) \u2286 L(C, Dc ), Theorem 5.9 shows that (C, Dc ) regularly\nembeds into a C \u2217 -diagonal. Lemma 2.3 shows that the inclusion map of (C, D) into (C, Dc ) is\na regular \u2217-monomorphism. Composing the embedding of (C, Dc ) into a C \u2217 -diagonal with the\ninclusion map shows that (c) implies (d).\nFinally, if (d) holds, Theorem 5.1 shows that Dc is abelian, so (d) implies (b).\n\u0003\n7. A Description of S(C, D) for a Regular MASA Inclusion\nFor a regular inclusion, (C, D), the D-radical, Rad(C, D) is the intersection of the left kernels of\ncompatible states, and when (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, L(C, D) is the intersection of the\nleft kernels of strongly compatible states. Question 5.6 asks whether it is possible for these ideals\nto be distinct. In order to make progress on this question, it seems likely that a description of\nS(C, D) will be useful. The purpose of this section is to provide this description.\nThe description is in terms of groups which are determined locally by the action of N(C, D) and\ncertain positive definite forms on these groups.\nWe begin with some generalities on T-groups, and describe a class of positive-definite functions\non T-groups which behave like compatible states. The following is more-or-less standard.\nDefinition 7.1. Let G be a locally compact group with identity element 1, and let U be the\nconnected component of the identity. We say that G is a T-group if U is clopen, isomorphic and\nhomeomorphic to T, and contained in the center of G. A subgroup H of G is a T-subgroup of G\nif H contains U . When G is a T-group, we will always identify U with T (and so will write G/T\ninstead of G/U ).\nEquivalently, a T-group is a central extension of T by a discrete group K,\nq\n\n1 \u2192 T \u0592\u2192 G \u0589 K \u2192 1.\nIf f : G \u2192 T is a continuous homomorphism, we define the index of f to be the unique integer n\nfor which f (\u03bb) = \u03bbn for every \u03bb \u2208 T.\n38\n\n\fAs a set, G may be identified with T \u00d7 K, and the topology on G is the product of the usual\ntopology on T with the discrete topology on K. Also, the Haar measure on G is the product of\nHaar measure on T with the counting measure on K.\nThe T-subgroups of G are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of K: if H is a Tsubgroup of G, then q(H) is a subgroup of K and for any subgroup \u0393 of K, q \u22121 (\u0393) is a T-subgroup\nof G.\nWe also recall that a function f : G \u2192 C is positive definite if f is continuous, and if for every\nn \u2208 N and g1 , . . . , gn \u2208 G, the n \u00d7 n complex matrix, A := (f (gi\u22121 gj ))i,j satisfies A \u2265 0.\nProposition 7.2. Let G be a T-group with identity 1.\n(1) Let f : G \u2192 C be a positive-definite function such that f (1) = 1 and which satisfies\n|f (g)| \u2208 {0, 1} for every g \u2208 G. Set\nH := {g \u2208 G : f (g) 6= 0}.\nThen\na) f (g1 g2 ) = f (g1 )f (g2 ) for any g1 , g2 \u2208 G such that H \u2229 {g1 , g2 } =\n6 \u2205; and\nb) H is a T-subgroup of G and f |H is a continuous homomorphism of H onto T.\n(2) Let H \u2286 G be a T-subgroup and suppose \u03c6 : H \u2192 T is a continuous homomorphism. Define\nf : G \u2192 C by\n(\n\u03c6(h) if h \u2208 H\nf (g) =\n0\nif h \u2208\n/ H.\nThen f is a positive definite function on G such that f (1) = 1 and for every g \u2208 G,\n|f (g)| \u2208 {0, 1}.\nProof. Suppose f satisfies the hypotheses in (1). Since f (1) = 1 and f is positive definite, we have\nf (g) = f (g \u22121 ) for every g \u2208 G. Continuity of f and connectedness of T yield T \u2286 H.\nRecall that if H1 and H2 are Hilbert spaces, A \u2208 B(H1 ), C \u2208 B(H2 ), and B \u2208 B(H2 , H1 ) with\nA invertible, then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\n(28)\n\u2265 0 if and only if A \u2265 0, C \u2265 0 and C \u2212 B \u2217 A\u22121 B \u2265 0.\nB\u2217 C\n\nLet g1 , g2 \u2208 G. Then the positive definiteness of f (using the group elements h1 = 1, h2 = g1\u22121 ,\nand h3 = g2 ) implies that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\nf (g1\u22121 )\nf (g2 )\n\uf8ed f (g1 )\n1\nf (g1 g2 )\uf8f8 \u2265 0.\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nf (g2 ) f (g2 g1 )\n1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\nf (g1 g2 )\n\u22121\nApplying (28) with A = (1), B = f (g1 ) f (g2 ) , and C =\ngives\nf (g2\u22121 g1\u22121 )\n1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 f (g1 )f (g1\u22121 )\nf (g1 g2 ) \u2212 f (g1 )f (g2 )\n0\u2264\n=: M.\nf (g2\u22121 g1\u22121 ) \u2212 f (g2\u22121 )f (g1\u22121 )\n1 \u2212 f (g2\u22121 )f (g2 )\nSuppose now that g2 \u2208 H, that is, f (g2 ) 6= 0. Then f (g2 )f (g2\u22121 ) = 1, so that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 f (g1\u22121 )f (g1 )\nf (g1 g2 ) \u2212 f (g1 )f (g2 )\nM=\n.\nf (g2\u22121 g1\u22121 ) \u2212 f (g2\u22121 )f (g1\u22121 )\n0\n\nBut then 0 \u2264 det(M ) = \u2212|f (g1 g2 ) \u2212 f (g1 )f (g2 )|2 , so f (g1 g2 ) = f (g1 )f (g2 ).\nThe case when f (g1 ) 6= 0 is the same. Thus when H \u2229 {g1 , g2 } =\n6 \u2205 we obtain,\nf (g1 g2 ) = f (g1 )f (g2 ).\n39\n\n\fThe facts that H is a T-subgroup of G and f |H : H \u2192 T is a continuous homomorphism are now\napparent.\nTurning now to statement (2), let H be a T-subgroup of G, and \u03c6 a continuous homomorphism\nof H into T. Let f : G \u2192 T be given as in the statement. The continuity of f is clear, as is\nthe fact that f (1) = 1 and |f (g)| \u2208 {0, 1} for every g \u2208 G. To show f is positive definite, let\ng1 , . . . , gn \u2208 G. Since \u03c6(h) = \u03c6(h\u22121 ), it follows that f (gi\u22121 gj ) = f (gj\u22121 gi ). Put X = {1, . . . , n}.\nDefine an equivalence relation R on X by (i, j) \u2208 R if and only if gi\u22121 gj \u2208 H, and let X/R be the\nset of equivalence classes. Let q : X \u2192 X/R be the map which sends j \u2208 X to its equivalence class,\nand let u : X/R \u2192 X be a section for q. Let \u03b4x,y be the Kronecker delta function on X/R and for\nx \u2208 X/R, define\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\n\u22121\ngn )\u03b4q(n),x .\ng1 )\u03b4q(1),x . . . f (gu(q(n))\ncx := f (gu(q(1))\n\nThen c\u2217x cx is an n \u00d7 n matrix whose i, j-th entry is\n\u22121\ngj )\u03b4q(i),x \u03b4q(j),x\nf (gi\u22121 gu(q(i)) )f (gu(q(j))\n\nHence the i, j-th entry of\n\nP\n\n(\nf (gi\u22121 gj )\n=\n0\n\nif q(i) = q(j) = x\notherwise.\n\nis f (gi\u22121 gj ) if (i, j) \u2208 R and 0 otherwise. Therefore\nX\n(f (gi\u22121 gj ))i,j\u2208X =\nc\u2217x cx \u2265 0,\n\n\u2217\nx\u2208X/R cx cx\n\nx\u2208X/R\n\nas desired.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.3. Let f be a continuous positive definite function on the T-group G such that |f (g)| \u2208\n{0, 1} for every g \u2208 G. Then there exists p \u2208 Z such that for every \u03bb \u2208 T and g \u2208 G,\nf (\u03bbg) = \u03bbp f (g).\nProof. The set {g \u2208 G : f (g) 6= 0} contains T, and Proposition 7.2 shows the restriction of f to T\nis a character on T. So there exists p \u2208 Z such that f (\u03bb) = \u03bbp for every \u03bb \u2208 T. The corollary now\nfollows from another application of Proposition 7.2.\n\u0003\nDefinition 7.4. Given a T-group G, call a positive-definite function f on G satisfying f (1) = 1\nand |f (g)| \u2208 {0, 1} a pre-homomorphism.\nWe will call the number p appearing in Corollary 7.3 the index of f , and will denote it by ind(f ).\nFinally, the group H := {g \u2208 G : f (g) 6= 0} will be called the supporting subgroup for f , and will\nbe denoted by supp(f ).\nNotation. Some notation will be useful.\n(1) Let (C, D) be an inclusion. For \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, let\nS(C, D, \u03c3) := {\u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) : \u03c1|D = \u03c3},\n\nand\n\nSs (C, D, \u03c3) := {\u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, D) : \u03c1|D = \u03c3}.\n(2) For any T-group G, let pHom1 (G) denote the set of all pre-homomorphisms f : G \u2192 T\u222a{0}\nwith ind(f ) = 1.\n(3) Finally, recall the seminorms, B\u03c1,\u03c3 on C from [10, Definition 2.4]: for each \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, the\nseminorm B\u03c1,\u03c3 is defined on C by\nB\u03c1,\u03c3 (x) := inf{kdxek : d, e \u2208 D, \u03c1(d) = \u03c3(e) = 1}\n\n(x \u2208 C).\n\nWe shall require these seminorms for \u03c1 = \u03c3; however, instead of writing B\u03c3,\u03c3 we shall write\nB\u03c3 .\n40\n\n\fAssociated to each regular inclusion (C, D) and \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 is a certain T-group, denoted H\u03c3 /R1 ,\nwhich we now construct. We produce a distinguished unitary representation T of H\u03c3 /R1 . Our goal\nis to exhibit a bijection between elements of\n{f \u2208 pHom1 (H\u03c3 /R1 ) : f determines a state on the C \u2217 -algebra generated by T (H\u03c3 /R1 )}\nand S(C, D, \u03c3).\nDefinition 7.5. Let (C, D) be an inclusion, and let \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302.\n(1) Define\nH\u03c3 := {v \u2208 N(C, D) : \u03c3(v \u2217 dv) = \u03c3(d) for every d \u2208 D}.\nWe remark that H\u03c3 is the set which arises when considering the D-stabilizer of \u03c1 \u2208\nMod(C, D), where \u03c3 = \u03c1|D (see Definition 4.13). However, there our interest was in a\nparticular extension of \u03c3, while here we do not wish to specify the extension.\nNotice that for v \u2208 H\u03c3 , we have \u03c3(v \u2217 v) = 1, and that H\u03c3 is closed under the adjoint\noperation: replace d by v \u2217 dv in the definition. Furthermore, it is easy to see that H\u03c3 is a\n\u2217-semigroup.\n(2) Let \u039b \u2286 T be a subgroup, (we write the product multiplicatively). Define\nR\u039b := {(v, w) \u2208 H\u03c3 \u00d7 H\u03c3 : B\u03c3 (\u03bbI \u2212 w\u2217 v) = 0 for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039b}.\nWhen \u039b = {1}, we write R1 instead of R{1} .\nLemma 7.6. Let (C, D) be an inclusion, let \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, and let v, w \u2208 H\u03c3 . Then\nB\u03c3 (v) = 1\n\nand\n\nB\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) = B\u03c3 (I \u2212 v \u2217 w) = B\u03c3 (I \u2212 vw\u2217 ).\n\nProof. Note that for any h \u2208 D, |\u03c3(h)| = inf{kd\u2217 hdk : d \u2208 D, \u03c3(d) = 1}. Hence given \u03b5 > 0, and\ne \u2208 D with \u03c3(e) = 1, we may find d \u2208 D with \u03c3(d) = 1 and\n|kd\u2217 v \u2217 e\u2217 evdk \u2212 \u03c3(v \u2217 e\u2217 ev)| < \u03b5.\nSince \u03c3(v \u2217 e\u2217 ev) = \u03c3(e\u2217 e) = 1, we obtain 1 \u2212 \u03b5 < kevdk2 < 1 + \u03b5. Hence 1 \u2212 \u03b5 < B\u03c3 (v)2 < 1 + \u03b5,\nand the fact that B\u03c3 (v) = 1 follows.\nNext, let x, d, e \u2208 D with \u03c3(x) = \u03c3(d) = \u03c3(e) = 1. Since \u03c3(xvdv \u2217 ) = 1, we have\nB\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) \u2264 k(xvdv \u2217 )(v \u2212 w)ek = kxv(dv \u2217 ve \u2212 dv \u2217 we)k\n\u2264 kxvk kdv \u2217 ve \u2212 dv \u2217 wek\n\u2264 kxvk [kdv \u2217 ve \u2212 dek + kd(I \u2212 v \u2217 w)ek] .\nIt follows that\nB\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) \u2264 B\u03c3 (I \u2212 v \u2217 w).\nA similar argument using multiplication on the right by w\u2217 ewx gives B\u03c3 (I \u2212 v \u2217 w) \u2264 B\u03c3 (w\u2217 \u2212 v \u2217 ).\nBut B\u03c3 (v \u2217 \u2212 w\u2217 ) = B\u03c3 (v \u2212 w), so we obtain B\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) = B\u03c3 (I \u2212 v \u2217 w). Finally, B\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) =\nB\u03c3 (v \u2217 \u2212 w\u2217 ) = B\u03c3 (I \u2212 vw\u2217 ).\n\u0003\nProposition 7.7. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 and suppose that v \u2208 H\u03c3 . Let\n\u039b \u2286 T be a subgroup. The following statements are equivalent:\n(1) for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, B\u03c3 (\u03bbI \u2212 v) = 0;\n(2) there exists \u03bb \u2208 \u039b such that f (v) = \u03bb whenever f \u2208 Mod(C, D, \u03c3);\n(3) there exists \u03bb \u2208 \u039b such that \u03c1(v) = \u03bb whenever \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, D, \u03c3);\n(4) \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 and v\u0302(\u03c3) \u2208 \u039b (where v\u0302 is as in Remark 3.19);\n(5) there exists \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and h, k \u2208 D such that \u03c3(h) = 1 = \u03c3(k) and vh = \u03bbk.\n41\n\n\fProof. (1) \u21d2 (2). If f \u2208 Mod(C, D, \u03c3) and x \u2208 C, then |f (x)| = |f (dxe)| \u2264 kdxek whenever d, e \u2208 D\nand \u03c3(d) = \u03c3(e) = 1. Thus, |f (x)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (x) for every x \u2208 C. The implication (1) \u21d2 (2) follows.\n(2) \u21d2 (3) is trivial.\n(3) \u21d2 (4). Suppose \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and that \u03c1(v) = \u03bb for every \u03c1 \u2208 {f \u2208 Ss (C, D) : f |D = \u03c3}. By\nLemma 2.14, \u03c3 \u2208 fix \u03b2v . To show that \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 , we argue by contradiction. So suppose that\n\u03c3 \u2208 fix \u03b2v \\(fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 . Then every neighborhood of \u03c3 contains an element in D\u0302 \\fix \u03b2v . Hence we may\nfind a net (\u03c3s ) in D\u0302 such that \u03c3s \u2192 \u03c3 and such that \u03c3s \u2208\n/ fix \u03b2v . By Theorem 3.21, the restriction\nmap f 7\u2192 f |D from Ss (C, D) to D\u0302 is onto. Thus we may choose fs \u2208 Ss (C, D) such that fs |D = \u03c3s .\nBy passing to a subnet if necessary, we may assume that fs converges to a state f . Theorem 3.21\nshows that Ss (C, D) is closed, so f \u2208 Ss (C, D). Clearly f |D = \u03c3. Lemma 2.14 gives fs (v) = 0 for\nevery s, so 0 6= \u03bb = f (v) = lims fs (v) = 0. This is absurd, so we conclude that \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 .\nLet \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, D, \u03c3). Then for h \u2208 Jv , we have\n(29)\n\nv\u0302(\u03c3)\u03c3(h) = \u03c3(vh) = \u03c1(vh) = \u03c1(v)\u03c3(h).\n\nBy Proposition 3.2, \u03c3|Jv 6= 0. Statement (4) now follows from equation (29).\n(4) \u21d2 (5). Let \u03bb = v\u0302(\u03c3) and choose h \u2208 Jv such that \u03c3(h) = 1. Then \u03c3(vh) = v\u0302(\u03c3). Put\nk = v\u0302(\u03c3)vh.\n(5) \u21d2 (1). Let h, k \u2208 D be chosen so that \u03c3(h) = \u03c3(k) = 1 and vh = \u03bbk. Then\nB\u03c3 (\u03bbI \u2212 v) \u2264\n\ninf\n\n{d\u2208D:\u03c3(d)=1}\n\nkd(\u03bbI \u2212 v)hdk = |\u03c3(\u03bbh \u2212 vh)| = 0.\n\nThus (1) holds.\n\u0003\nWe next observe that B\u03c3 gives the quotient norm on the quotient of spanH\u03c3 by the ideal generated\nby ker \u03c3.\nProposition 7.8. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion and suppose \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. Let C\u03c3 = spanH\u03c3 . Then\n(C\u03c3 , D) is a regular inclusion. If I\u03c3 is the closed, two-sided ideal of C\u03c3 generated by ker \u03c3, then B\u03c3\nvanishes on I\u03c3 , and for x \u2208 C\u03c3 ,\nB\u03c3 (x) = inf{kx + jk : j \u2208 I\u03c3 }.\nMoreover, the following statements hold.\n(1) If \u03c1 is a state on C\u03c3 which annihilates I\u03c3 , then \u03c1 extends uniquely to a state \u03c1\u0303 on C. When\n\u03c1 \u2208 S(C\u03c3 , D) annihilates I\u03c3 , \u03c1\u0303 \u2208 S(C, D).\n(2) The map H\u03c3 \u220b u 7\u2192 u + I\u03c3 \u2208 C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 is a \u2217-homomorphism of the \u2217-semigroup H\u03c3 into the\nunitary group of C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nProof. Since H\u03c3 is closed under multiplication and the adjoint map, we see that C\u03c3 is a C \u2217 -algebra.\nFor d \u2208 D, d = limt\u21920 tI + d. But for all sufficiently small t 6= 0, (t + \u03c3(d))\u22121 (tI + d) \u2208 H\u03c3 ,\nso d is a limit of scalar multiples of elements of H\u03c3 . So D \u2286 C\u03c3 . Therefore (C\u03c3 , D) is a regular\ninclusion.\nNext, suppose that x \u2208 C and d \u2208 ker \u03c3. Then B\u03c3 (xd) = B\u03c3 (dx) = 0. When x = v \u2208 H\u03c3 and\ny \u2208 C\u03c3 ,\nB\u03c3 (vdy) = B\u03c3 (vv \u2217 vdy) = B\u03c3 (vdv \u2217 vy) = |\u03c3(vdv \u2217 )|B\u03c3 (vy) = 0.\nIt follows that when x \u2208 span H\u03c3 , we have B\u03c3 (xdy) = 0. Taking closures we obtain B\u03c3 (xdy) = 0\nwhen x, y \u2208 C\u03c3 and d \u2208 ker \u03c3. Therefore, B\u03c3 (z) = 0 for every z \u2208 I\u03c3 .\nThis gives B\u03c3 (x) \u2264 B\u03c3 (x + j) + B\u03c3 (j) = B\u03c3 (x + j) \u2264 kx + jk for every x \u2208 C\u03c3 and j \u2208 I\u03c3 . Thus,\nB\u03c3 (x) \u2264 dist(x, I\u03c3 ).\n42\n\n\fNotice that if \u03c1 is a state on C\u03c3 which annihilates I\u03c3 , then \u03c1|D annihilates ker \u03c3, so \u03c1|D = \u03c3.\nAny extension of \u03c3 to a state g on C belongs to Mod(C, D). Hence |g(x)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (x) for every x \u2208 C.\nIn particular, |\u03c1(x)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (x) for every x \u2208 C\u03c3 . So if x \u2208 C\u03c3 , we obtain,\nkx + I\u03c3 k = sup{|\u03c1(x)| : \u03c1 is a state on C\u03c3 and \u03c1|I\u03c3 = 0} \u2264 B\u03c3 (x).\nHence B\u03c3 gives the quotient norm on C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nTurning now to statement (1), let \u03c1 be a state on C\u03c3 which annihilates I\u03c3 , and suppose for\ni = 1, 2, that \u03c4i are states on C with \u03c4i |C\u03c3 = \u03c1. Let v \u2208 N(C, D) \\ {\u03bbu : u \u2208 H\u03c3 and \u03bb \u2208 C}.\nWe claim that \u03c4i (v) = 0. Since \u03c1 annihilates I\u03c3 , we have \u03c3 = \u03c1|D = \u03c4i |D . Suppose that\n\u03c3(v \u2217 v) 6= 0. By multiplying v by a suitable scalar, we may assume that \u03c3(v \u2217 v) = 1. Since v is not\na scalar multiple of an element of H\u03c3 , we see that \u03b2v (\u03c3) 6= \u03c3. Lemma 2.14 shows that \u03c4i (v) = 0.\nOn the other hand, if \u03c3(v \u2217 v) = 0, then v \u2217 v \u2208 I\u03c3 , so \u03c4i (v) = limn\u2192\u221e \u03c4i (v(v \u2217 v)1/n ) = 0. Thus the\nclaim holds.\nSince \u03c41 (v) = \u03c42 (v) for every v \u2208 H\u03c3 , we have \u03c41 (v) = \u03c42 (v) for every v \u2208 N(C, D). Hence\n\u03c41 = \u03c42 . Thus \u03c1 extends uniquely to a state on C. Notice also that if \u03c1 \u2208 S(C\u03c3 , D), then this\nargument shows that \u03c1\u0303 \u2208 S(C, D).\nTo prove statement (2), use the fact that B\u03c3 gives the quotient norm on C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 and apply\nLemma 7.6 to u \u2208 H\u03c3 .\n\u0003\nThe following is a corollary of Proposition 7.8.\nProposition 7.9. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion, \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 and let \u039b be a subgroup of T. Then\nR\u039b is an equivalence relation on H\u03c3 . Denote the equivalence class of v \u2208 H\u03c3 by [v]\u039b . The product\n[v]\u039b [w]\u039b := [vw]\u039b is a well-defined product on H\u03c3 /R\u039b . With this product, [I]\u039b is the unit and for\n\u2217\neach v \u2208 H\u03c3 , [v]\u22121\n\u039b = [v ]\u039b . Thus H\u03c3 /R\u039b is a group.\nFurthermore, the map T\u03c3 : H\u03c3 /R1 \u2192 C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 given by T\u03c3 ([u]1 ) = u + I\u03c3 is a one-to-one group\nhomomorphism of H\u03c3 /R1 into the unitary group of C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 , and T\u03c3 (H\u03c3 /I\u03c3 ) generates C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nProof. Let u, v \u2208 H\u03c3 . By Proposition 7.8 and Lemma 7.6, (u, v) \u2208 R\u039b if and only if there exists\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b such that u + I\u03c3 = \u03bbv + I\u03c3 . Routine arguments now show that H\u03c3 /R\u039b is a group under the\nindicated operations. The final statement follows from Proposition 7.8(2).\n\u0003\nLemma 7.10. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302, and suppose u, v \u2208 H\u03c3 are such\nthat (u, v) \u2208 R1 . Then the following statements hold.\n(1) If \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3), then\n\u03c1(v) = \u03c1(u).\nIf in addition, 0 6= \u03c1(v) then \u03c1(v) \u2208 T.\n(2) \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 if and only if \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2u )\u25e6 , and when this occurs, v\u0302(\u03c3) = \u00fb(\u03c3) \u2208 T.\nProof. Suppose \u03c1(v) 6= 0. Since |\u03c1(x)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (x) for every x \u2208 C and B\u03c3 (I \u2212 u\u2217 v) = 0, we have\n\u03c1(u\u2217 v) = 1. Therefore, by part 1 of Proposition 4.3,\n\u03c1(u) = \u03c1(u)\u03c1(u\u2217 v) = \u03c1(uu\u2217 v) = \u03c3(uu\u2217 )\u03c1(v) = \u03c1(v).\nLikewise, if \u03c1(u) 6= 0, then \u03c1(u) = \u03c1(v). Thus, we have \u03c1(u) = \u03c1(v) whenever \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3).\nNext, when \u03c1(v) 6= 0, the fact that \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) gives\n|\u03c1(v)|2 = \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = \u03c3(v \u2217 v) = 1,\nso \u03c1(v) \u2208 T. This completes the proof of the first statement.\nWe now turn to the second statement. Since (u, v) \u2208 R1 , Proposition 7.7 implies \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v\u2217 u )\u25e6 .\nThus \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 if and only if \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2u )\u25e6 .\n43\n\n\fNext suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 (fix(\u03b2v ))\u25e6 . Let (I(D), \u03b9) be an injective envelope for D and let E be the\n[ be such that \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u03c3. Then\npseudo-expectation for \u03b9. Let h \u2208 Jv satisfy \u03c3(h) = 1 and let \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)\n[ Thus\n\u03c1 \u25e6 E \u2208 Ss (C, D), and Proposition 3.18 shows that \u03c1 \u2208 supp(E(v)).\nv\u0302(\u03c3) = \u03c3(vh) = \u03c1(E(v)) = \u03c1(E(w)) = \u03c3(wh) = \u0175(\u03c3).\nSince \u03c1(E(v)) 6= 0, we have v\u0302(\u03c3) \u2208 T by part (1).\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark. Lemma 7.10 shows that for \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D) with \u03c1|D = \u03c3, we have a well-defined map\n\u03c1\u0303 : H\u03c3 /R1 \u2192 T \u222a {0} given by \u03c1\u0303([v]) = \u03c1(v).\nTheorem 7.11. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion, and let \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. The function\nd([v], [w]) := B\u03c3 (v \u2212 w)\nis a well defined metric on H\u03c3 /R1 and makes H\u03c3 /R1 into a T-group. More specifically, the following\nstatements hold.\n(1) Let\nU = {[v] \u2208 H\u03c3 /R1 : \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 }.\nThen U is clopen and is the connected component of the identity in H\u03c3 /R1 .\n(2) The subgroup U is contained in the center of H\u03c3 /R1 .\n(3) The map [v] \u2208 U 7\u2192 v\u0302(\u03c3) is an isomorphism of U onto T.\n(4) The quotient of H\u03c3 /R1 by U is H\u03c3 /RT .\nProof. Let T\u03c3 be the isomorphism of H\u03c3 /R1 onto a subgroup of the unitary group of C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 defined\nin Proposition 7.9. Then\nd([v], [w]) = kT\u03c3 ([v]) \u2212 T\u03c3 ([w])kC\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nIt follows that d is a well-defined metric which makes H\u03c3 /R1 into a topological group.\nWe now show that U is an open set. Let u \u2208 H\u03c3 be such that [u] \u2208 U and suppose that v \u2208 H\u03c3\nsatisfies d([u], [v]) < 1/2. We will show that \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 . To do this we modify the proof of the\nimplication (3) \u21d2 (4) in Proposition 7.7 slightly. Since B\u03c3 (u \u2212 v) < 1/2, for every \u03c1 \u2208 Ss (C, D),\nwe have |\u03c1(u) \u2212 \u03c1(v)| < 1/2.\nSuppose, to obtain a contradiction, that \u03c3 \u2208\n/ (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 . Then we may find find a directed set S\nand a net (\u03c3s )s\u2208S such that \u03c3s \u2208\n/ fix \u03b2v for every s and such that \u03c3s \u2192 \u03c3. As usual, let (I(D), \u03b9) be\n[\nan injective envelope for D and let E be the pseudo-expectation for \u03b9. For each s, choose \u03c4s \u2208 I(D)\n[\nsuch that \u03c4s \u25e6\u03b9 = \u03c3s . Passing to a subnet if necessary, we may assume that \u03c4s converges to \u03c4 \u2208 I(D).\nThen \u03c4 \u25e6E \u2208 Ss (C, D) and \u03c4 \u25e6E|D = \u03c3. Notice that \u03c4 (E(v)) 6= 0 because |\u03c4 (E(v))\u2212\u03c4 (E(u))| < 1/2\nand \u03c4 (E(u)) \u2208 T. Since \u03c4s \u25e6 E|D = \u03c3s \u2208\n/ fix \u03b2v , Lemma 2.14 shows that \u03c4s (E(v)) = 0 for every\ns \u2208 S. Then\n\u03c4 (E(v)) = lim \u03c4s (E(v)) = 0,\ns\n\ncontradicting the fact that \u03c4 (E(v)) 6= 0. Thus \u03c3 \u2208 (fix \u03b2v )\u25e6 . Therefore [v] \u2208 U , so U is an open\nsubset of H\u03c3 /R1 .\nSimilarly, the complement of U is open in H\u03c3 /R1 , so U is also closed.\nLet \u03b3 : U \u2192 T be the map \u03b3([u]) = \u00fb(\u03c3). Suppose that [u], [v] \u2208 U and \u00fb(\u03c3) = v\u0302(\u03c3). Then\nd([u], [v]) = B\u03c3 (u \u2212 v) \u2264 B\u03c3 (u \u2212 \u00fb(\u03c3)I) + B\u03c3 (v\u0302(\u03c3)I \u2212 v) = 0,\nso \u03b3 is one-to-one. Since \u03b3([\u03bbu]) = \u03bb\u03b3([u]) for any \u03bb \u2208 T, \u03b3 is onto.\nLet \u03c1 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3). Since\n|\u03c1\u0303([v]) \u2212 \u03c1\u0303([w])| = |\u03c1(v \u2212 w)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (v \u2212 w) = d([v], [w]),\n44\n\n\fwe see that \u03c1\u0303 is a continuous map on H\u03c3 /R1 . By Lemma 7.10, for [v] \u2208 U, \u03c1\u0303([v]) = \u03b3([v]). So \u03b3 is\nalso continuous. The map \u03bb \u2208 T 7\u2192 [\u03bbI] is the inverse of \u03b3, and we see that \u03b3 is a homeomorphism.\nIn particular, U is connected, and hence U is the connected component of the identity in H\u03c3 /R1 .\nTo see that U is contained in the center of H\u03c3 /R1 , observe that for [u] \u2208 U , we have [u] = [\u03b3([u])I],\nwhich evidently belongs to the center of H\u03c3 /R1 .\nSince the connected component of the identity is compact, H\u03c3 /R1 is a locally compact group.\nFinally, [v] = [w] mod U if and only if [v \u2217 w] \u2208 U . Therefore, [v] = [w] mod U if and only if\nB\u03c3 (\u03b3([v \u2217 w])I \u2212 v \u2217 w) = 0. Hence the quotient of H\u03c3 /R1 by U is H\u03c3 /RT .\n\u0003\nWe now are prepared to exhibit a bijection between S(C, D, \u03c3) and a class of pre-homomorphisms\non H\u03c3 /R1 . We pause for some notation.\nLet q : C\u03c3 \u2192 C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 be the quotient map. Define a \u2217-homomorphism \u03b8 : Cc (H\u03c3 /R1 ) \u2192 C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 by\nZ\n\u03c6(s)T\u03c3 (s) ds,\n\u03b8(\u03c6) =\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nwhere ds is Haar measure on H\u03c3 /R1 . Then the image of \u03b8 is dense in C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nDefinition 7.12. We will say that a positive definite function f on H\u03c3 /R1 is dominated by B\u03c3 if\nfor every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G),\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6(t)T\u03c3 (t) dt\n.\n\u03c6(t)f (t) dt \u2264\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nC\u03c3 /I\u03c3\n\nTheorem 7.13. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion and let \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. Let\nM\u03c3 := {f \u2208 pHom1 (H\u03c3 /R1 ) : f is dominated by B\u03c3 }.\nFor \u03c4 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3) the map \u03c4\u0303 : H\u03c3 /R1 \u2192 C given by\n\u03c4\u0303 ([v]1 ) = \u03c4 (v)\nis well-defined, and \u03c4\u0303 \u2208 M\u03c3 . Moreover, the map \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4\u0303 is a bijection between S(C, D, \u03c3) and M\u03c3 .\nProof. If \u03c4 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3), then |\u03c4 (x)| \u2264 B\u03c3 (x). Hence \u03c4 annihilates I\u03c3 , so that \u03c4 determines a state\n\u03c4 \u2032 on C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 such that\n\u03c4 |C\u03c3 = \u03c4 \u2032 \u25e6 q.\nThen \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 \u2032 \u25e6 T\u03c3 , so \u03c4\u0303 is well-defined.\nSet\nG := {[v] \u2208 H\u03c3 /R1 : \u03c4\u0303 ([v]) 6= 0}.\nProposition 4.3(1) implies that G is closed under products. For v \u2208 H\u03c3 with [v] \u2208 G, we have\n\u03c4 (v) \u2208 T, and as \u03c4 is a state, \u03c4 (v \u2217 ) = \u03c4 (v). Therefore, [v]\u22121 = [v \u2217 ] \u2208 G, so G is closed under\ninverses. It follows that G is a T-subgroup of H\u03c3 /R1 . Since \u03c4 \u2208 S(C, D), |\u03c4 ([v])| \u2208 {0, 1} for every\n[v] \u2208 H\u03c3 /R1 . Proposition 7.2 implies that \u03c4\u0303 is a pre-homomorphism on H\u03c3 /R1 . Since \u03c4 is linear,\nfor \u03bb \u2208 T and v \u2208 H\u03c3 , we have \u03c4\u0303 ([\u03bbv]1 ) = \u03c4 (\u03bbv) = \u03bb\u03c4\u0303 ([v]1 ). So ind(\u03c4\u0303 ) = 1.\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (H\u03c3 /R1 ) we have\n!\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c6(s)T\u03c3 (s) ds\n.\n\u03c6(s)T\u03c3 (s) ds \u2264\n\u03c6(s)\u03c4\u0303 (s) ds = \u03c4\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nThus, \u03c4\u0303 is dominated by B\u03c3 . Therefore, \u03c4\u0303 \u2208 M\u03c3 .\n45\n\nC\u03c3 /I\u03c3\n\n\fNext we show that the map \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4\u0303 is surjective. So suppose that f : H\u03c3 /R1 \u2192 {0} \u222a T is a\npre-homomorphism dominated by B\u03c3 and ind(f ) = 1. Then the map F0 : \u03b8(Cc (H\u03c3 /R1 )) \u2192 C\ngiven by\n! Z\nZ\n\u03c6(t)f (t) dt\n(\u03c6 \u2208 Cc (H\u03c3 /R1 ))\n\u03c6(t)T\u03c3 (t) dt =\nF0\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nextends by continuity to a bounded linear functional F on C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 . Since \u03b8 is a \u2217-homomorphism\nand f is a positive definite function, F is a positive linear functional. Clearly kF k \u2264 1.\nWe next show that F (v +I\u03c3 ) = f ([v]) for every v \u2208 H\u03c3 . Since H\u03c3 /R1 is a T-group, the connected\ncomponent of the identity is T. Since f is continuous, ind(f ) = 1 and f (1) = 1, we have f (\u03bb) = \u03bb\nfor every \u03bb \u2208 T. Given v \u2208 H\u03c3 , let \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (H\u03c3 /R1 ) be the function given by\n(\n\u03bb if t = [\u03bbv]1 for some \u03bb \u2208 T\n\u03c6(t) =\n0 otherwise.\nNow for t \u2208 {[\u03bbv]1 : \u03bb \u2208 T} \u2286 H\u03c3 /R1 , we have T\u03c3 (t) = \u03bbq(v), so\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6(t)T\u03c3 (t) dt =\n\u03b8(\u03c6) =\n\u03bbq(\u03bbv)dt = q(v).\nT\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nThus,\nF (q(v)) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(t)f (t) dt =\n\nH\u03c3 /R1\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u03bbf ([\u03bbv]1 ) dt = f ([v]1 ).\n\nIt follows that kF k = 1, so F is a state on C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 .\nAs N(C\u03c3 , D) \u2286 N(C, D), we see that if w \u2208 N(C\u03c3 , D), then w is a scalar multiple of an element of\nH\u03c3 . Since |F \u25e6 q(v)| = |f ([v]1 )| \u2208 {0, 1} for each v \u2208 H\u03c3 , we find F \u25e6 q \u2208 S(C\u03c3 , D). Proposition 7.8\nshows that F \u25e6 q extends uniquely to an element \u03c4 \u2208 S(C, D, \u03c3). As \u03c4\u0303 = f , we find that the map\n\u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4\u0303 is onto.\nTo show that \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4\u0303 is one-to-one, suppose \u03c4 and \u03c41 belong to S(C, D, \u03c3) and \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 \u03031 . Then\n\u03c4 (v) = \u03c41 (v) for every v \u2208 H\u03c3 , so that \u03c4 |C\u03c3 = \u03c41 |C\u03c3 . Proposition 7.8 then shows \u03c4 = \u03c41 .\nThus the mapping \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4\u0303 is indeed a bijection.\n\u0003\nWe conclude this section with a pair of very closely related questions and two examples.\nNotation 7.14. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion and let\nB(C, D) := {x \u2208 C : B\u03c3 (x) = 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302}.\nBy Proposition 7.8, B(C, D) = {x \u2208 C : \u03c1(x\u2217 x) = 0 for all \u03c1 \u2208 Mod(C, D)}, and by Proposition 2.16, B(C, D) is an ideal of C which satisfies\n(30)\n\nB(C, D) \u2286 Rad(C, D).\n\nQuestion 7.15. Let (C, D) be a regular MASA inclusion.\n(1) Let \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. For x \u2208 C, is B\u03c3 (x) = sup\u03c1\u2208S(C,D) \u03c1(x\u2217 x)1/2 ?\n(2) Is B(C, D) = Rad(C, D)?\nWhen Rad(C, D) = (0), the answer to both questions is yes.\nExample 7.16. This example applies the previous results to a special case of reduced crossed\nproducts to produce a Cartan inclusion (C, D) and a pure state \u03c4 on C such that \u03c4 |D \u2208 D\u0302, yet\n\u03c4\u2208\n/ S(C, D).\n46\n\n\fLet \u0393 be an infinite discrete group, let X := \u0393 \u222a {\u221e} be the one-point compactification of \u0393 and\nlet \u0393 act on X by extending the left regular representation to X: for s \u2208 \u0393 and x \u2208 X, let\n(\nsx if x \u2208 \u0393;\nsx :=\nx if x = \u221e.\nWe now use the notation from Section 6: let C = C(X) \u22car \u0393 and D be the cannonical image of\nC(X) in C. We identify D\u0302 with X. The action of \u0393 on X is topologically free, so (C, D) is a regular\nMASA inclusion. Moreover, the conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D is the pseudo-expectation.\nLet \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 be the map \u03c3(f ) = f (\u221e). We claim that H\u03c3 /RT = \u0393 and H\u03c3 /R1 = T \u00d7 \u0393. Observe\nfirst that S(C, D, \u03c3) = {\u03c3 \u25e6 E} and the map \u03b8 : \u0393 \u2192 H\u03c3 /RT given by \u03b8(s) = [ws ]T is a group\nhomomorphism. Next, suppose v \u2208 H\u03c3 . Then there exists t \u2208 \u0393, so that Et (v) = E(vwt\u22121 ) 6= 0.\nSince both v and wt\u22121 \u2208 H\u03c3 we have vwt\u22121 \u2208 H\u03c3 , so \u03c3(E(vwt\u22121 )) 6= 0. By Proposition 7.7,\n(v, wt ) \u2208 RT . Thus \u03b8 is surjective. Proposition 7.7 also implies \u03b8 is one-to-one: if [ws ]T = [wt ]T\nthen \u03c3(E(wst\u22121 )) 6= 0, so that E(wst\u22121 ) 6= 0. Thus s = t. Therefore \u03b8 is an isomorphism of H\u03c3 /RT\nonto \u0393, and we use \u03b8 to identify \u0393 with H\u03c3 /RT . The map \u0393 \u220b s 7\u2192 [ws ]1 \u2208 H\u03c3 /R1 is a group\nhomomorphism and also a section for the quotient map of H\u03c3 /R1 onto H\u03c3 /RT . It follows that\nH\u03c3 /R1 is isomorphic to T \u00d7 \u0393.\nLet \u03c1 = \u03c3 \u25e6 E and let (\u03c0\u03c1 , H\u03c1 ) be the GNS representation of C associated to \u03c1. Proposition 7.8\nimplies that I\u03c3 \u2286 ker \u03c0\u03c1 , so \u03c0\u03c1 induces a representation, again denoted \u03c0\u03c1 , of C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 on H\u03c3 .\nWe shall show that the image of C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 under \u03c0\u03c1 is isomorphic to Cr\u2217 (\u0393). To do this, first\nobserve that for v, w \u2208 H\u03c3 , v + L\u03c1 = w + L\u03c1 if and only if (v, w) \u2208 R1 . Indeed, since v, w \u2208 H\u03c3 ,\n\u03c1(w\u2217 w) = \u03c1(v \u2217 v) = 1, so \u03c1((v \u2212 w)\u2217 (v \u2212 w)) = 2 \u2212 2R(\u03c1(v \u2217 w)). Since |\u03c1(v \u2217 w)| \u2208 {0, 1}, we get\nv + L\u03c1 = w + L\u03c1 if and only if \u03c1(v \u2217 w) = 1, which by Proposition 7.7 gives the observation. This\nobservation and regularity of C\u03c3 implies that\n{ws + L\u03c1 : s \u2208 \u0393}\nis an orthonormal basis for H\u03c1 . Thus there is a unitary operator U : l2 (\u0393) onto H\u03c1 which carries\nthe basis element \u03b4s \u2208 l2 (\u0393) to ws + L\u03c1 \u2208 H\u03c1 .\nNow let \u03bb : \u0393 \u2192 B(l2 (\u0393)) be the left regular representation. For s, t \u2208 \u0393 we have U \u03bb(s)\u03b4t =\nwst + L\u03c1 = \u03c0\u03c1 (ws )U \u03b4t , so\n(31)\n\nU \u03bb(s) = \u03c0\u03c1 (ws )U.\n\nIt follows from Proposition 7.9 that the set {ws + I\u03c3 : s \u2208 \u0393} generates C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 , so (31) shows that\n\u03c0\u03c1 (C\u03c3 /I\u03c3 ) is isomorphic to Cr\u2217 (\u0393).\nThus there is a surjective \u2217-homomorphism \u03a8 : C\u03c3 \u2192 Cr\u2217 (\u0393) which annihilates I\u03c3 . The composition of \u03a8 with any pure state f on Cr\u2217 (\u0393) yields a pure state on C\u03c3 , which in turn may be extended\nto a pure state \u03c4 \u2208 Mod(C, D, \u03c3). Apply this process when \u0393 = F2 is the free group on 2-generators\nu1 and u2 . By [26, Theorem 2.6 and Remark 3.4], there exists a pure state f on Cr\u2217 (F2 ) such that\n|f (u1 )| \u2208\n/ {0, 1}. It follows that there exists a pure state \u03c4 on C such that \u03c4 |D = \u03c3, yet \u03c4 \u2208\n/ S(C, D).\nExample 7.17. Denote by {en }n\u2208N the standard orthonormal basis for H := l2 (N). Consider the\ninclusion (C, D), where C is the Toeplitz algebra (the C \u2217 -algebra generated by the unilateral shift\nS acting on H) and D \u2286 B(H) is the C \u2217 -algebra generated by {S k S \u2217k : k \u2265 0}. Then (C, D) is a\nregular MASA inclusion and D\u0302 is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of N, N \u222a {\u221e}.\nWe identify D\u0302 with this space.\nHere the pseudo-expectation is the conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D which takes T \u2208 C to the\noperator E(T ) which acts on basis elements via E(T )en = hT en , en i en .\nWe shall do the following:\n(1) give a description of S(C, D);\n47\n\n\f(2) show that not every element of S(C, D) is a pure state of C and identify the pure states in\nS(C, D).\nThe strongly compatible states are easy to identify. Let \u03c1n and \u03c1\u221e be the states on C given by\n\u03c1n (X) = hXen , en i and \u03c1\u221e (X) = limn\u2192\u221e \u03c1n (X). Then\nSs (C, D) = {\u03c1n : n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}} = {\u03c3 \u25e6 E : \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302}.\nFor each n \u2208 N, the set {n} is clopen in D\u0302, so \u03c1n is the unique extension of \u03c1n |D to a state on C.\n(This can be proved directly or viewed as a consequence of Theorem 3.8.)\nThus, to complete a description of S(C, D), we need only describe S(C, D, \u03c3\u221e ), where \u03c3\u221e =\n\u03c1\u221e |D .\nTo do this, let K = K(H) be the compact operators and let q : C \u2192 C/K = C(T) be the quotient\nmap. Given z \u2208 T, we write \u03c4z for the state on C given by \u03c4z (T ) = q(T )(z). Also, for z \u2208 T,\nwe let \u03b1z be the gauge automorphism on C determined by \u03b1z (S) = zS. For each N \u2208 N, let\n\u03bb(N ) = exp(2\u03c0i/N ) and define \u03a6N : C \u2192 C by\n\u03a6N (T ) :=\n(Note that if T =\nWe claim that\n(32)\n\nPp\n\nN \u22121\n1 X k\n\u03b1\u03bb(N ) (T ).\nN\nk=0\n\nk=\u2212p ak S\n\nk\n\nis a \"trigonometric polynomial,\" then \u03a6N (T ) =\n\nS(C, D, \u03c3\u221e ) = {\u03c1\u221e } \u222a {\u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N : z \u2208 T, N \u2208 N}.\n\nP\n\nk\u2208N Z ak S\n\nk .)\n\nEach state of the form \u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a61 = \u03c4z is multiplicative on C. Therefore, {\u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a61 : z \u2208 T} is a set\nof pure states and is a subset of S(C, D). Also, we have\nZ\nN \u22121\n1 X\n\u03c4z dz and for N \u2265 1, \u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N =\n\u03c1\u221e =\n\u03c4\u03bb(N )k z ,\nN\nT\nk=0\n\nso the only pure states on the right hand side of (32) are those of the form \u03c4z . We will show that\nstates of the form \u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N are compatible states. We proceed by first identifying the elements of\nN(C, D) with \u03c3\u221e (v \u2217 v) 6= 0.\nSuppose v \u2208 N(C, D) satisfies \u03c3\u221e (v \u2217 v) > 0. Put Av = {n \u2208 N : hv \u2217 ven , en i =\n6 0} and Bv = {n \u2208\nN : hvv \u2217 en , en i =\n6 0}. Then \u03b2v induces a bijection f : Av \u2192 Bv , and there exist scalars cj so that\n(\ncj if i = f (j);\nvij := hvej , ei i =\n0 otherwise.\n\nMoreover, note that q(v) = cq(S)m for some c \u2208 C and m \u2208 Z. Since \u03c3\u221e (v \u2217 v) 6= 0, c 6= 0, so v\nis a Fredholm operator. Let m be the Fredholm index of v. Then q(v) = \u03c1\u221e (vS \u2212m )q(S)m . Thus\nv = S m d for some d \u2208 D with \u03c3\u221e (d) 6= 0. The fact that each \u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N \u2208 S(C, D), now follows. It\nremains to show that we have found all elements of S(C, D, \u03c3\u221e ).\nWe will write H\u221e , B\u221e , C\u221e , and J\u221e rather than the more cumbersome H\u03c3\u221e , B\u03c3\u221e , C\u03c3\u221e , and\nJ\u03c3\u221e . Then\nH\u221e = {S m d : m \u2208 Z and d \u2208 D, \u03c3\u221e (d) \u2208 T}.\nThus, J\u221e = K and C\u221e = C. By Proposition 7.8, B\u221e gives the quotient norm on C\u221e /J\u221e = C(T).\nNext, for v, w \u2208 H\u221e , we have B\u221e (v \u2212 w) = 0 if and only if \u03c1\u221e (w\u2217 v) = 1. In other words,\n(v, w) \u2208 R1 if and only if q(v) = q(w). Therefore, H\u221e /R1 is isomorphic to the direct product\nT \u00d7 Z. Observe that H\u221e /RT is isomorphic to Z, and we obtain the trivial T-group extension,\n1 \u2192 T \u2192 T \u00d7 Z \u2192 Z \u2192 1.\n48\n\n\fThe generators of the subgroups of Z are the non-negative integers, so the T-subgroups of T \u00d7 Z\nare\n{T \u00d7 nZ : n \u2265 0}.\nLet f be a pre-homomorphism of index 1 on H\u221e /R1 . Then there exists a non-negative integer\nN such that f is a character on T \u00d7 N Z. Since f has index 1, there exists \u03bb \u2208 Z such that for\n(z, n) \u2208 T \u00d7 Z = H\u221e /R1 ,\n(\nz\u03bbn if n \u2208 N Z;\nf (z, n) =\n0\notherwise.\nAs B\u221e is the quotient norm on C\u221e , f is dominated by B\u221e . Let \u03c4 = \u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N . With the notation\nof Theorem 7.13, we get \u03c4\u0303 = f , so by Theorem 7.13, the compatible state corresponding to f is\n\u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N . This completes the proof of (32).\nWe now identify the topology on S(C, D). Notice that if M, N are positive integers with N \u2208\n/ M Z,\nthen for any z \u2208 T, \u03c4z (\u03a6N (S N )) = \u03c4z (S N ) = z N 6= 0 = \u03c4z (\u03a6M (S N )). Given distinct positive\nintegers N, M , either N \u2208\n/ M Z or M \u2208\n/ N Z. Thus for N > 0, {\u03c6z \u25e6 \u03a6N : z \u2208 T} is a connected\ncomponent of S(C, D) and is homeomorphic to T.\nWe next show that if G is a weak-\u2217 open neighborhood of \u03c1\u221e , then there exists N \u2208 N such that\nTn := {\u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6n : z \u2208 Z} \u2286 G for every n \u2265 N . To do this, it suffices to show that for every a \u2208 C\nand \u03b5 > 0, the set Ga,\u03b5 := {\u03c6 \u2208 S(C, D) : |\u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03c1\u221e (a)| < \u03b5} contains Tn for all sufficiently large\nn, and this is what we shall do. First observe that for every b \u2208 C,\n(33)\n\nlim k\u03a6n (b) \u2212 E(b)k = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(This is clear for \"trigonometric polynomials\" in S, approximate b in norm with a trigonometric\npolynomial to obtain (33).) Fix N \u2208 N so that k\u03a6n (a) \u2212 E(a)k < \u03b5 for every n \u2265 N . For any\nz \u2208 T, we have \u03c4z (E(a)) = \u03c1\u221e (a), so we find\n|\u03c4z (\u03a6n (a)) \u2212 \u03c1\u221e (a)| < \u03b5.\nSo Tn \u2286 Ga,\u03b5 for all n \u2265 N .\nWe conclude that\nS(C, D) = Ss (C, D) \u222a {\u03c4z \u25e6 \u03a6N : z \u2208 T, N \u2208 N},\n\u0001\nS\nwhich may be viewed as the one-point compactification of the space N \u222a\nN \u2208N T \u00d7 {N } , with\n\u03c1\u221e corresponding to the point at infinity.\n8. The Twist of a Regular Inclusion\nThroughout this section, we fix, once and for all, a regular inclusion (C, D) and a closed N(C, D)invariant subset F \u2286 S(C, D) such that the restriction map, f \u2208 F 7\u2192 f |D , is a surjection of F onto\nD\u0302. When (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion, Theorem 3.13 shows Ss (C, D) \u2286 F . For this reason,\nwe have in mind taking F = Ss (C, D), though other choices (e.g. F = S(C, D)) may be useful for\nsome purposes.\nIn this section, we show that associated to this data, there is a twist (\u03a3, G), which, when (C, D)\nis a C \u2217 -diagonal (in which case F is necessarily Ss (C, D)) or a Cartan pair (with F = Ss (C, D))\ngives the twist of the pair as defined by Kumjian [22] for C \u2217 -diagonals, or for Cartan pairs given\nby Renault in [31]. The set F will be used as the unit space for the \u00e9tale groupoid G associated to\nthe twist (\u03a3, G).\nOur construction parallels the constructions by Kumjian and Renault, but with several differences. First, in the Renault and Kumjian contexts, a conditional expectation E : C \u2192 D is present,\nand since {\u03c1 \u25e6 E : \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0302} is homeomorphic to D\u0302, Renault and Kumjian use D\u0302 as the unit space for\nthe twists they construct. In our context, we need not have a conditional expectation, so we use the\nset F as a replacement for D\u0302. Next, as in the constructions of Kumjian and Renault, we construct a\n49\n\n\fregular \u2217-homomorphism \u03b8 : (C, D) \u2192 (Cr\u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )), however, \u03b8(C) need not equal Cr\u2217 (\u03a3, G),\nand the kernel of \u03b8 is not trivial unless the ideal KF = {x \u2208 C : f (x\u2217 x) = 0 for all f \u2208 F } = (0).\nWe note however, that this ideal is trivial in the cases considered by Kumjian and Renault.\n8.1. Twists and their C \u2217 -algebras. Before proceeding, it is helpful to recall some generalities\non twists and the (reduced) C \u2217 -algebras associated to them.\nDefinition 8.1. The pair (\u03a3, G) is a twist if \u03a3 and G are Hausdorff locally compact topological\ngroupoids, G is an \u00e9tale groupoid and the following hold:\n(1) there is a free action of T by homeomorphisms of \u03a3 such that whenever (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u2208 \u03a3(2) and\nz1 , z2 \u2208 T, we have (z1 \u03c31 , z2 \u03c32 ) \u2208 \u03a3(2) and (z1 \u03c31 )(z2 \u03c32 ) = (z1 z2 )(\u03c31 \u03c32 );\n(2) there is a continuous surjective groupoid homomorphism \u03b3 : \u03a3 \u0589 G such that for every\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, \u03b3 \u22121 (\u03b3(\u03c3)) = {z\u03c3 : z \u2208 T};\n(3) the bundle (\u03a3, G, \u03b3) is locally trivial.\nNotice that \u03b3|\u03a3(\u25e6) : \u03a3(\u25e6) \u2192 G(\u25e6) is a homeomorphism of the unit space of \u03a3 onto the unit space\nof G. We will usually use this map to identify \u03a3(\u25e6) and G(\u25e6) .\nRecall that given a twist \u03a3 over the \u00e9tale topological groupoid G, one can form the twisted\ngroupoid C \u2217 -algebra of the pair (\u03a3, G). We summarize the construction in our context, for details,\nsee [31, Section 4] and [22, Section 2]. We note that in both [31] and [22], there is a blanket\nassumption that the \u00e9tale groupoid G is second countable. However, for what we require here, this\nhypothesis is not used. The reader may also wish to consult Section 3 of [12].\nLet Cc (\u03a3, G) be the family of all compactly supported continuous complex valued functions f\non \u03a3 which are equivariant, that is, which satisfy f (z\u03c3) = zf (\u03c3) for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, z \u2208 T. Given\nf, g \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G), notice whenever \u03c4, \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 with s(\u03c4 ) = s(\u03c3) and z \u2208 T, we have f (\u03c3\u03c4 \u22121 )g(\u03c4 ) =\nf (\u03c3(z\u03c4 )\u22121 )g(z\u03c4 ). For x \u2208 G and \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 with s(x) = s(\u03c3), let \u03c4 \u2208 \u03b3 \u22121 (x). Then\n(f \u229b g)(\u03c3, x) := f (\u03c3\u03c4 \u22121 )g(\u03c4 )\ndoes not depend on the choice of \u03c4 \u2208 \u03b3 \u22121 (x). The product of f with g is defined by\nX\n(f \u229b g)(\u03c3, x),\n(f \u22c6 g)(\u03c3) =\nx\u2208G\ns(x)=s(\u03c3)\n\nand the adjoint operation is defined by\nf \u2217 (\u03c3) = f (\u03c3 \u22121 ).\nThese operations make Cc (\u03a3, G) into a \u2217-algebra.\nSimilarly, notice that for f \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G), z \u2208 T and \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, |f (\u03c3)| = |f (z\u03c3)|, so for x \u2208 G, we\ndenote by |f (x)| the number |f (\u03c3)|, where \u03c3 \u2208 \u03b3 \u22121 (x). In particular, |f | may be viewed as a\nfunction on G.\nOne may norm Cc (\u03a3, G) as in [31] or [22]. For convenience, we provide a sketch of an equivalent,\nbut slightly different method. Given x \u2208 G(\u25e6) , let \u03b7x : Cc (\u03a3, G) \u2192 C by \u03b7x (f ) = f (x). Then\n\u03b7x is a positive linear functional in the sense that for each f \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G), \u03b7x (f \u2217 \u22c6 f ) \u2265 0. Let\nNx := {f \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G) : \u03b7x (f \u2217 \u22c6 f ) = 0} and let Hx be the completion of Cc (\u03a3, G)/Nx with respect\nto the inner product hf + Nx , g + Nx i = \u03b7x (g\u2217 \u22c6 f ).\nRecall that a slice of G is an open set U \u2286 G so that r|U and s|U are one-to-one. By [12,\nProposition 3.10], given f \u2208 CS\nc (\u03a3, G), there exist n \u2208 N and slices U1 , . . . , Un of G such that the\nsupport of |f | is contained in nk=1 Uk . Let n(f ) \u2265 0 be the smallest integer such that there exist\nSn(f )\nslices U1 , . . . Un(f ) with the support of |f | is contained in k=1 Uk .\n50\n\n\fFor f, g \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G), a calculation shows that\nk(f \u22c6 g) + Nx k \u2264 n(f ) kf k\u221e kg + Nx kHx .\nTherefore, the map g + Nx 7\u2192 (f \u22c6 g) + Nx extends to a bounded linear operator \u03c0x (f ) on Hx . It\nis easy to see that \u03c0x is a \u2217-representation of Cc (\u03a3, G). Also, if \u03c0x (f ) = 0 for every x \u2208 G(\u25e6) , then\nkf + Nx kHx = 0 for each x \u2208 G(\u25e6) . A calculation then gives f = 0. Thus,\nkf k := sup k\u03c0x (f )k .\nx\n\ndefines a norm on Cc (\u03a3, G). The (reduced) twisted C \u2217 -algebra, C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), is the completion of\nCc (\u03a3, G) relative to this norm. Clearly, the representation \u03c0x extend by continuity to a representation, again called \u03c0x , of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G).\nAs observed in the remarks following [31, Proposition 4.1], elements of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) may be regarded\nas equivariant continuous functions on \u03a3, and the formulas defining the product and involution on\nCc (\u03a3, G) remain valid for elements of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G). Also, as in [31, Proposition 4.1], for \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, and\nf \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G),\n|f (\u03c3)| \u2264 kf k .\nDefinition 8.2. We shall call the smallest topology on C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) such that for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, the\npoint evaluation functional, C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) \u220b f 7\u2192 f (\u03c3) is continuous, the G(\u25e6) -compatible topology on\nC \u2217 (\u03a3, G). Clearly this topology is Hausdorff.\nThe open support of f \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) is supp(f ) = {\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 : f (\u03c3) 6= 0}. Then C0 (G(\u25e6) ) may be\nidentified with\n{f \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) : supp(f ) \u2286 G(\u25e6) }.\nIn order to remain within the unital context, we now assume that the unit space of G is compact.\nIn this case C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) is unital, and C(G(\u25e6) ) \u2286 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), so that (C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )) is an inclusion.\nWe wish to show that it is a regular inclusion.\nRecall (see [12, Section 3]) that a slice (or G-set) of G is an open subset S \u2286 G such that\nthe restrictions of the range and source maps to S are one-to-one. We will say that an element\nf \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) is supported in the slice S if \u03b3(supp(f )) \u2286 S.\nIf f \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) is supported in a slice U , then a computation (see [31, Proposition 4.8]) shows\nthat f \u2208 N(C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )), and because the collection of slices forms a basis for the topology of\nG ([12, Proposition 3.5]), it follows (as in [31, Corollary 4.9]) that (C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )) is a regular\ninclusion.\nProposition 8.3. Let \u03a3 be a twist over the Hausdorff \u00e9tale groupoid G. Assume that the unit\nspace X of G is compact. Then there is a faithful conditional expectation E : C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) \u2192\nC(G(\u25e6) ), the inclusion (C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )) is regular. If in addition, is C(G(\u25e6) ) is a MASA, then\nRad(C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )) = (0).\nRemark 8.4. The condition that C(G(\u25e6) ) is a MASA is satisfied when G(\u25e6) is second countable\nand G is essentially principal, that is, when the interior of the isotropy bundle for G is G(\u25e6) , see [31,\nProposition 4.2]. We expect that it is possible to remove the hypothesis of second countability here,\nbut we have not verified this.\nProof of Proposition 8.3. The existence of the conditional expectation is proved as in [31, Proposition 4.3] or [30, Proposition II.4.8], and we have already observed that the inclusion is regular.\nWhen C(G(\u25e6) ) is a MASA in C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), the triviality of the radical follows from Proposition 5.7.\n\u0003\n51\n\n\f8.2. Compatible Eigenfunctionals and the Twist for (C, D). We turn next to a discussion\nof eigenfunctionals, for a certain class of eigenfunctionals will yield our twist. Recall (see [10])\nthat an eigenfunctional is a non-zero element \u03c6 \u2208 C# which is an eigenvector for both the left and\nright actions of D on C# ; when this occurs, there exist unique elements \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 so that whenever\nd1 , d2 \u2208 D and x \u2208 C, we have \u03c6(d1 xd2 ) = \u03c1(d1 )\u03c6(x)\u03c3(d2 ). We write\ns(\u03c6) := \u03c3\n\nand r(\u03c6) := \u03c1.\n\nDefinition 8.5. A compatible eigenfunctional is a eigenfunctional \u03c6 such that for every v \u2208\nN(C, D),\n|\u03c6(v)|2 \u2208 {0, s(\u03c6)(v \u2217 v)}.\n\n(34)\n\nLet Ec (C, D) denote the set consisting of the zero functional together with the set of all compatible\neigenfunctionals, and let E1c (C, D) be the set of compatible eigenfunctionals which have unit norm.\nEquip both Ec (C, D) and E1c (C, D) with the relative \u03c3(C# , C) topology.\nRemark. Notice that when \u03c6 is an eigenfunctional and v \u2208 N(C, D) is such that \u03c6(v) 6= 0, then\nfor every d \u2208 D,\ns(\u03c6)(v \u2217 dv)\n= r(\u03c6)(d).\ns(\u03c6)(v \u2217 v)\n\n(35)\n\nIndeed, \u03c6(v)s(\u03c6)(v \u2217 dv) = \u03c6(vv \u2217 dv) = \u03c6(dvv \u2217 v) = r(\u03c6)(d)\u03c6(v)s(\u03c6)(v \u2217 v). Thus, taking d = 1, the\ncondition in (34) is equivalent to\n|\u03c6(v)|2 \u2208 {0, r(\u03c6)(vv \u2217 )}.\n\n(36)\n\nWe now show that associated with each \u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D) is a pair f, g \u2208 S(C, D) which extend r(\u03c6)\nand s(\u03c6). Note that regularity of the inclusion (C, D) ensures the existence of v \u2208 N(C, D) such\nthat \u03c6(v) > 0.\nProposition 8.6. Let \u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D), and let v \u2208 N(C, D) satisfy \u03c6(v) > 0. Define elements\nf, g \u2208 C# by\n\u03c6(vx)\n\u03c6(xv)\nand g(x) =\n.\nf (x) =\n\u03c6(v)\n\u03c6(v)\nThen the following statements hold.\ni) f, g \u2208 S(C, D), r(\u03c6) = f |D and s(\u03c6) = g|D .\nii) For every x \u2208 C,\ng(v \u2217 x)\nf (xv \u2217 )\n\u03c6(x) =\n=\n.\ng(v \u2217 v)1/2\nf (vv \u2217 )1/2\niii) For every x \u2208 C, g(v \u2217 xv) = g(v \u2217 v)f (x) and f (vxv \u2217 ) = f (vv \u2217 )g(x).\nProof. The definitions show f |D = r(\u03c6) and g|D = s(\u03c6). We next claim that kf k = kgk = 1. For\nany d \u2208 D with s(\u03c6)(d) = 1, replacing v by vd in the definition of f does not change f . Thus, if\nx \u2208 C and kxk \u2264 1, we have |f (x)| \u2264 inf{ kvdk\n\u03c6(v) : d \u2208 D, s(\u03c6)(d) = 1} = 1 (because d may be chosen\nso that kvdk = kd\u2217 v \u2217 vdk1/2 is as close to s(\u03c6)(v \u2217 v)1/2 as desired). This shows kf k = 1. Likewise\nkgk = 1. As f (1) = g(1) = 1, both f and g are states on C.\nIf w \u2208 N(C, D) and f (w) 6= 0, we have (using (35))\n|f (w)|2 =\n\n\u03c6(wv)2\n\u03c6(v)\n\n2\n\n=\n\ns(\u03c6)(v \u2217 w\u2217 wv)\n= r(\u03c6)(w\u2217 w) = f (w\u2217 w),\ns(\u03c6)(v \u2217 v)\n\nand it follows that f \u2208 S(C, D). Likewise, g \u2208 S(C, D).\n52\n\n\fStatements (ii) and (iii) are calculations using (34) and (36) whose verification is left to the\nreader.\n\u0003\nNotation. For v \u2208 N(C, D) and f \u2208 S(C, D) such that f (v \u2217 v) > 0, let [v, f ] \u2208 C# be defined by\n*\n+\nv + Lf\nf (v \u2217 x)\n[v, f ](x) :=\n= x + Lf ,\n.\nkv + Lf kHf\nf (v \u2217 v)1/2\nHf\n\n(This notation is borrowed from Kumjian [22]. There, Kumjian works in the context of C \u2217 -diagonals\nand uses states on C of the form \u03c3 \u25e6 E with \u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302. As we assume no conditional expectation here,\nwe replace functionals of the form \u03c3 \u25e6 E, with elements from S(C, D). See also [31].)\nWe have the following.\nLemma 8.7. If v \u2208 N(C, D) and f \u2208 S(C, D) with f (v \u2217 v) > 0, then [v, f ] \u2208 E1c (C, D) and the\nfollowing statements hold.\ni) s([v, f ]) = f |D and r([v, f ]) = \u03b2v (f |D ).\nii) [v, f ] = [w, g] if and only if f = g and f (v \u2217 w) > 0.\nProof. Suppose that f \u2208 S(C, D), v \u2208 N(C, D) and f (v \u2217 v) 6= 0. Let \u03c6 = [v, f ]. A calculation shows\nthat \u03c6 is a norm-one eigenfunctional and that statement (i) holds.\nIf w \u2208 N(C, D) and \u03c6(w) 6= 0, then\n|\u03c6(w)|2 =\n\nf (v \u2217 ww\u2217 v)\n|f (v \u2217 w)|2\n=\n= \u03b2v (s(\u03c6))(ww\u2217 ) = r(\u03c6)(ww\u2217 ),\nf (v \u2217 v)\nf (v \u2217 v)\n\nso \u03c6 belongs to E1c (C, D) by (36).\nTurning now to part (ii), suppose that \u03c6 = [v, f ] = [w, g]. Then we have s(\u03c6) = f |D = g|D . For\nevery x \u2208 C, Proposition 8.6 gives\nf (x) =\nSince\n\ng(w \u2217 v)\ng(w \u2217 w)1/2\n\n\u03c6(vx)\n\u03c6(v)\n\nand g(x) =\n\n\u03c6(wx)\n.\n\u03c6(w)\n\n= \u03c6(v) = f (v \u2217 v)1/2 , we obtain\ng(w\u2217 v) = f (v \u2217 v)1/2 g(w\u2217 w)1/2 > 0.\n\nLikewise, f (v \u2217 w) > 0. Also,\nf (x) =\n\ng(w\u2217 v)g(x)\n[w, g](vx)\ng(w\u2217 vx)\n\u03c6(vx)\n=\n=\n=\n= g(x),\n\u03c6(v)\n[v, f ](v)\ng(w\u2217 v)\nf (v \u2217 v)1/2 g(w\u2217 w)1/2\n\nwhere the fourth equality follows from Proposition 4.3.\nConversely, if f \u2208 S(C, D) and v, w \u2208 N(C, D) with f (v \u2217 w) > 0, Proposition 4.3 shows that\nf (v \u2217 w)2 = f (w\u2217 w)f (v \u2217 v), so that in the GNS Hilbert space Hf , we have hv + Lf , w + Lf i =\nkv + Lf k kw + Lf k. By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, there exists a positive real number t so\nthat v + Lf = tw + Lf . But then for any x \u2208 C,\n[v, f ](x) =\n\nhx + Lf , tw + Lf i\nhx + Lf , v + Lf i\n=\n= [w, f ](x).\nkv + Lf k\nktw + Lf k\n\u0003\n\nCombining Proposition 8.6 and Lemma 8.7 we obtain the following.\n53\n\n\fTheorem 8.8. If \u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D), then there exist unique elements s(\u03c6), r(\u03c6) \u2208 S(C, D) such that\nwhenever v \u2208 N(C, D) satisfies \u03c6(v) 6= 0 and x \u2208 C,\n\u03c6(vx) = \u03c6(v) s(\u03c6)(x)\n\nand\n\n\u03c6(xv) = r(\u03c6)(x) \u03c6(v).\n\nIf v \u2208 N(C, D) satisfies \u03c6(v) > 0, then \u03c6 = [v, s(\u03c6)]. Moreover,\nE1c (C, D) = {[v, f ] : v \u2208 N(C, D), f \u2208 S(C, D) and f (v \u2217 v) 6= 0}.\nProof. Suppose v, w \u2208 N(C, D) are such that \u03c6(v) > 0 and \u03c6(w) > 0. For x \u2208 C, set\nf (x) :=\n\n\u03c6(vx)\n\u03c6(v)\n\nand g(x) :=\n\n\u03c6(wx)\n.\n\u03c6(w)\n\nProposition 8.6 shows that \u03c6 = [v, f ] = [w, g]. Lemma 8.7 yields f = g. Another application of\nProposition 8.6 shows that for any x \u2208 C,\n\u03c6(xw)\n\u03c6(xv)\n=\n.\n\u03c6(v)\n\u03c6(w)\nThen taking s(\u03c6) = f , and r(\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c6(xv)\n\u03c6(v) ,\n\nwe obtain the result.\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that for \u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D), we have s(\u03c6) \u2208 F if and only if r(\u03c6) \u2208 F .\nDefinition 8.9. Let E1F (C, D) := {\u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D) : s(\u03c6) \u2208 F }. We shall call \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D) an\nF -compatible eigenfunctional. Notice that\nE1F (C, D) = {[v, f ] : f \u2208 F and f (v \u2217 v) 6= 0}.\nWith these preparations in hand, we can show that E1F (C, D) forms a topological groupoid. The\ntopology has already been defined, so we need to define the source and range maps, composition\nand inverses.\nDefinition 8.10. Given \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D), let v \u2208 N(C, D) be such that \u03c6(v) > 0. We make the\nfollowing definitions.\n(1) We say that s(\u03c6) and r(\u03c6) are the source and range of \u03c6 respectively.\n(2) Define the inverse, \u03c6\u22121 by the formula,\n\u03c6\u22121 (x) := \u03c6(x\u2217 ).\nIf \u03c6 \u2208 E1c (C, D) and v \u2208 N(C, D) is such that \u03c6(v) > 0, (so that \u03c6 = [v, s(\u03c6)]), then a\ncalculation shows that \u03c6\u22121 = [v \u2217 , r(\u03c6)]. The fact that F is N(C, D)-invariant ensures that\n\u03c6\u22121 \u2208 E1F (C, D). Thus, our definition of \u03c6\u22121 is consistent with the definition of inverse in\nthe definition of the twist of a C \u2217 -diagonal arising in [22] and the twist of a Cartan MASA\nfrom [31].\n(3) For i = 1, 2, let \u03c6i \u2208 E1F (C, D). We say that the pair (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) is a composable pair if\ns(\u03c62 ) = r(\u03c61 ). As is customary, we write E1F (C, D)(2) for the set of composable pairs. To\ndefine the composition, choose vi \u2208 N(C, D) with \u03c6i (vi ) > 0, so that \u03c6i = [vi , s(\u03c6i )]. By\nProposition 8.6(iii), we have\ns(\u03c62 )(v2\u2217 v1\u2217 v1 v2 ) = r(\u03c62 )(v1\u2217 v1 )s(\u03c62 )(v2\u2217 v2 ) = s(\u03c61 )(v1\u2217 v1 )s(\u03c62 )(v2\u2217 v2 ) > 0,\nso that [v1 v2 , s(\u03c62 )] is defined. The product is then defined to be \u03c61 \u03c62 := [v1 v2 , s(\u03c62 )].\nWe show now that this product is well defined. Suppose that (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) \u2208 E1F (C, D)(2) ,\nf = s(\u03c62 ), r(\u03c62 ) = g = s(\u03c61 ), and that for i = 1, 2, vi , wi \u2208 N(C, D) are such that\n\u03c61 = [v1 , g] = [w1 , g] and [v2 , f ] = [w2 , f ]. Then using Lemma 8.7, we have g(w1\u2217 v1 ) > 0 and\n54\n\n\ff (v2\u2217 w2 ) > 0, so, as f \u2208 S(C, D), there exists a positive scalar t such that v2 +Lf = tw2 +Lf .\nHence,\nf ((w1 w2 )\u2217 (v1 v2 )) = h\u03c0f (v1 )(v2 + Lf ), \u03c0f (w1 )(w2 + Lf )i\n= t h\u03c0f (v1 )(w2 + Lf ), \u03c0f (w1 )(w2 + Lf )i\n= tf (w2\u2217 (w1\u2217 v1 )w2 )\n= tf (w2\u2217 w2 )r(\u03c62 )(w1\u2217 v1 )\n= tf (w2\u2217 w2 )s(\u03c61 )(w1\u2217 v1 )\n= tf (w2\u2217 w2 )g(w1\u2217 v1 ) > 0.\nBy Lemma 8.7, [v1 v2 , f ] = [w1 w2 , f ], so that the product is well defined.\n(4) For \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D), denote the map C \u220b x 7\u2192 |\u03c6(x)| by |\u03c6|. Observe that for \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 E1F (C, D),\n|\u03c6| = |\u03c8| if and only if there exists z \u2208 T such that \u03c6 = z\u03c8. Let RF (C, D) := {|\u03c6| : \u03c6 \u2208\nE1F (C, D)}. We now define source and range maps, along with inverse and product maps on\nRF (C, D).\nSince a state on C is determined by its values on the positive elements of C, we identify\nf \u2208 S(C, D) with |f | \u2208 RF (C, D). Define s(|\u03c6|) = s(\u03c6) and r(|\u03c6|) = r(\u03c6). Next we\ndefine inversion in RF (C, D) by |\u03c6|\u22121 = |\u03c6\u22121 |, and composable pairs by RF (C, D)(2) :=\n{(|\u03c6|, |\u03c8|) : (\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 E1c (C, D)(2) }, and the product by RF (C, D)(2) \u220b (|\u03c6|, |\u03c8|) 7\u2192 |\u03c6\u03c8|.\nTopologize RF (C, D) with the topology of point-wise convergence: |\u03c6\u03bb | \u2192 |\u03c6| if and only if\n|\u03c6\u03bb |(x) \u2192 |\u03c6|(x) for every x \u2208 C. We call RF (C, D) the spectral groupoid over F of (C, D).\n(5) Define an action of T on E1F (C, D) by T \u00d7 E1F (C, D) \u220b (z, \u03c6) 7\u2192 z\u03c6, where (z\u03c6)(x) = \u03c6(zx).\nNotice that if \u03c6 is written as \u03c6 = [v, f ], where v \u2208 N(C, D) and f \u2208 F , then z\u03c6 = [zv, f ].\nWe have the following fact, whose proof is essentially the same as that of [10, Proposition 2.3]\n(the continuity of the range and source maps follows from their definition).\nProposition 8.11. The set E1F (C, D) \u222a {0} is a weak-\u2217 compact subset of C# , and the maps\ns, r : E1F (C, D) \u2192 S(C, D) are weak-\u2217\u2013weak-\u2217 continuous.\nTheorem 8.12. Let E1F (C, D) and RF (C, D) be as above. Then E1F (C, D) and RF (C, D) are locally\ncompact Hausdorff topological groupoids and RF (C, D) is an \u00e9tale groupoid. Their unit spaces\nare E1F (C, D)(\u25e6) = RF (C, D)(\u25e6) = F . Moreover, E1F (C, D) is a locally trivial topological twist over\nRF (C, D).\nProof. That inversion on E1F (C, D) is continuous follows readily from the definition of inverse map\nand the weak-\u2217 topology. Suppose (\u03c6\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b and (\u03c8\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b are nets in E1F (C, D) converging to \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208\nE1F (C, D) respectively, and such that (\u03c6\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb ) \u2208 E1F (C, D)(2) for all \u03bb. Since the source and range\nmaps are continuous, we find that s(\u03c6) = lim\u03bb s(\u03c6\u03bb ) = lim\u03bb r(\u03c8\u03bb ) = r(\u03c8), so (\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 E1F (C, D)(2) .\nLet v, w \u2208 N(C, D) be such that \u03c6(v) > 0 and \u03c8(w) > 0. There exists \u03bb0 , so that \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb0\nimplies \u03c6\u03bb (v) and \u03c8\u03bb (w) are non-zero. For each \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb0 , there exists scalars \u03be\u03bb , \u03b7\u03bb \u2208 T such that\n\u03c6\u03bb (v) = \u03be\u03bb [v, s(\u03c6\u03bb )] and \u03c8\u03bb = \u03b7\u03bb [v, s(\u03c8\u03bb )]. Since\nlim \u03c6\u03bb (v) = \u03c6(v) = lim[v, s(\u03c6\u03bb )](v)\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nand\n\nlim \u03c8\u03bb (v) = \u03c8(v) = lim[v, s(\u03c8\u03bb )](v),\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nwe conclude that lim \u03b7\u03bb = 1 = lim \u03be\u03bb . So for any x \u2208 C,\ns(\u03c8\u03bb )((vw)\u2217 x)\ns(\u03c8)((vw)\u2217 x)\n=\nlim\n= lim[v, s(\u03c6\u03bb )][w, s(\u03c8\u03bb )]\n\u03bb (s(\u03c8\u03bb )((vw)\u2217 (vw)))1/2\n\u03bb\n(s(\u03c8)((vw)\u2217 (vw)))1/2\n= lim(\u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb )(x),\n\n(\u03c6\u03c8)(x) =\n\n\u03bb\n\n55\n\n\fgiving continuity of multiplication. Notice that for \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D), s(\u03c6) = \u03c6\u22121 \u03c6 and r(\u03c6) = \u03c6\u03c6\u22121 ,\nand F \u2286 E1F (C, D). Thus, E1F (C, D) is a locally compact Hausdorff topological groupoid with unit\nspace F .\nThe definitions show that RF (C, D) is a groupoid. By construction, the map q defined by \u03c6 7\u2192 |\u03c6|\nis continuous and is a surjective groupoid homomorphism. The topology on RF (C, D) is clearly\nHausdorff. If \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D), and v \u2208 N(C, D) is such that \u03c6(v) 6= 0, then W := {\u03b1 \u2208 RF (C, D) :\n\u03b1(v) > |\u03c6(v)|/2} has compact closure so RF (C, D) is locally compact. Also, if \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2208 W and\nr(\u03b11 ) = r(\u03b12 ) = f , then writing \u03b1i = |\u03c8i | for \u03c8i \u2208 E1F (C, D), we see that \u03c8i (v) 6= 0, so there exist\nz1 , z2 \u2208 T so that for i = 1, 2 and every x \u2208 C, \u03c8i (x) = zi f (xv \u2217 )f (v)\u22121 . Hence \u03b11 = \u03b12 showing\nthat the range map is locally injective. We already know that the range map is continuous, so by\nlocal compactness, the range map is a local homeomorphism.\nNote that convergent nets in RF (C, D) can be lifted to convergent nets in E1F (C, D). Indeed, if\nq(\u03c6\u03bb ) \u2192 q(\u03c6) for some net (\u03c6\u03bb ) and \u03c6 in E1F (C, D), choose v \u2208 N(C, D) so that \u03c6(v) > 0. Then for\nlarge enough \u03bb, \u03c6\u03bb (v) 6= 0, and we have [\u03c6\u03bb , s(\u03c6\u03bb )] \u2192 \u03c6. Also, |[\u03c6\u03bb , s(\u03c6\u03bb )]| \u2192 |\u03c6|. The fact that\nthe groupoid operations on RF (C, D) are continuous now follows easily from the continuity of the\ngroupoid operations on E1F (C, D). Thus RF (C, D) is a locally compact Hausdorff \u00e9tale groupoid.\nFinally, q(\u03c61 ) = q(\u03c62 ) if and only if there exist z \u2208 T so that \u03c61 = z\u03c62 . Moreover, for each\nv \u2208 N(C, D), the map f 7\u2192 [v, f ], where f \u2208 {g \u2208 S(C, D) : g(v \u2217 v) > 0} is a continuous section for\nq. Also, the action of T on E1F (C, D). given above makes E1F (C, D) into a T-groupoid. So E1F (C, D)\nis a twist over RF (C, D).\n\u0003\nNotation 8.13. We now let\n\u03a3 = E1F (C, D) and G = RF (C, D),\n\nso that G(\u25e6) = F.\n\nFor a \u2208 C, define \u00e2 : E1F (C, D) \u2192 C to be the 'Gelfand' map: for \u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D), \u00e2(\u03c6) = \u03c6(a). Then\n\u00e2 is a continuous equivariant function on E1F (C, D).\nNote that if w \u2208 N(C, D), then \u0175 is compactly supported. Indeed, for \u03c6 = [v, f ] \u2208 E1F (C, D),\n\u03c6 \u2208 supp(\u0175) if and only if [v, f ](w) 6= 0, which occurs exactly when f (v \u2217 w) 6= 0. Proposition 4.3\nshows this occurs precisely when f (w\u2217 w) 6= 0. Hence,\nsupp \u0175 = {\u03c6 \u2208 E1F (C, D) : s(\u03c6)(w\u2217 w) 6= 0},\nand it follows that \u0175 has compact support. Moreover, \u0175 is supported on a slice, so that we find\n\u0175 \u2208 N(C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )).\nBefore stating the main result of this section, recall that Proposition 2.16 shows that KF = {x \u2208\nC : f (x\u2217 x) = 0 for all f \u2208 F } is an ideal of C whose intersection with D is trivial.\nTheorem 8.14. Let (C, D) be a regular inclusion, and let G := RF (C, D) and \u03a3 := E1F (C, D).\nThe map sending w \u2208 N(C, D) to \u0175 \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) extends uniquely to a regular \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03b8 : (C, D) \u2192 (C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )) with ker \u03b8 = KF . Furthermore, \u03b8(C) is dense in C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) in the\nG(\u25e6) -compatible topology.\nRemark. In general, \u03b8(C) and \u03b8(D) may be proper subsets of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) and C(G(\u25e6) ) respectively.\nProof. The point is that the norms on C/KF and C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) both arise from the left regular representation on appropriate spaces. Here are the details.\nWe have already observed that the map w 7\u2192 \u0175 sends normalizers to normalizers. Let C0 =\nspan N(C, D). Then for any a \u2208 C0 , \u00e2 \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G).\n56\n\n\fLet f \u2208 F = G(\u25e6) . Then f can be regarded as either a state on C or as determining a state on\nvia evaluation at f . We write fC when viewing f as a state on C, and f\u03a3 when viewing\nf as a state on C \u2217 (\u03a3, G).\nLet (\u03c0C,f , HC,f ) be the GNS representation of C arising from fC , and let (\u03c0\u03a3,f , H\u03a3,f ) be the GNS\nrepresentation of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) determined by f\u03a3 . (Writing x = f , the restriction of \u03c0\u03a3,f to Cc (\u03a3, G)\nis the representation \u03c0x discussed above when defining the norm on Cc (\u03a3, G).)\nFor typographical reasons, when the particular f is understood, we will drop the extra f in the\nnotation: write \u03c0C or \u03c0\u03a3 instead of \u03c0C,f or \u03c0\u03a3,f .\nNow fix f \u2208 G(\u25e6) . For a \u2208 C0 , we claim that\nC \u2217 (\u03a3, G)\n\nk\u00e2 + Nf kH\u03a3 = ka + Lf kHC .\n\n(37)\n\nLet T \u2286 \u039bf be chosen so that f (w\u2217 w) = 1 for every w \u2208 T and so that T contains exactly one\nelement from each \u223cf equivalence class. Proposition 8.7 shows that when w1 , w2 \u2208 \u039bf , we have\n|[w1 , f ]| = |[w2 , f ]| if and only if w1 \u223cf w2 . Proposition 4.10 shows that {w + Lf : w \u2208 T } is an\northonormal basis for HC . Writing \u03c6 = [w, f ], we have,\nX\nX\nX\n|\u00e2(|\u03c6|)|2 =\n|[w, f ](a)|2 =\n|f (w\u2217 a)|2\nk\u00e2 + Nf k2H\u03a3 =\nw\u2208T\n\n|\u03c6|\u2208G\ns(|\u03c6|)=f\n\nX\n\n=\n\nw\u2208T\n\n| ha + Lf , w + Lf i |2 = ka + Lf k2HC .\n\nw\u2208T\n\nIt follows that the map a + Lf 7\u2192 \u00e2 + Nf extends to an isometry Wf : HC \u2192 H\u03a3 .\nTo see that Wf is a unitary operator, fix \u03be \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G). Since \u03be is compactly supported, the set\nS\u03be := {|\u03c6| \u2208 G : s(|\u03c6|) = f and \u03be(|\u03c6|) 6= 0}\nis a finite set. Let |\u03c61 |, . . . , |\u03c6n | be the elements of S\u03be . For 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, we may find vj \u2208 N(C, D)\nsuch that |\u03c6j | = |[vj , f ]|.\nP By Proposition 8.7, we may assume each vj belongs to the set T . Let\nzj = \u03be(\u03c6j ) and set a = nj=1 zj vj . Clearly a \u2208 C0 . Using the fact that f (w\u2217 w) = 1 for each w \u2208 T\nand the fact that f (w1\u2217 w2 ) = 0 for distinct elements w1 , w2 \u2208 T , we find that for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n,\n[vk , f ](a) = zk .\nThen\nk(\u00e2 \u2212 \u03be) +\n\nNf k2H\u03a3\n\n\u2217\n\n= f\u03a3 ((\u00e2 \u2212 \u03be) \u22c6 (\u00e2 \u2212 \u03be)) =\n\nn\nX\n\n|(\u00e2 \u2212 \u03be)(|\u03c6j |)|2\n\nj=1\n\n=\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u00e2(\u03c6j ) \u2212 \u03be(\u03c6j ))(\u00e2(\u03c6j ) \u2212 \u03be(\u03c6j )) =\n\nj=1\nn\nX\n\nn\nX\n\n|([vj , f ](a) \u2212 \u03be(\u03c6j ))|2\n\nj=1\n\n(zj \u2212 \u03be(\u03c6j ))2 = 0.\n\nj=1\n\nTherefore, {\u00e2 + Nf : a \u2208 C0 } = {\u03be + Nf : \u03be \u2208 Cc (\u03a3, G)}. As this set is dense in H\u03a3 , Wf is a unitary\noperator.\nNext, we show that for a \u2208 C0 , we have\n(38)\n\n\u03c0\u03a3 (\u00e2)Wf = Wf \u03c0C (a).\n\nTo do this, it suffices to show that for each v \u2208 T ,\n\u03c0\u03a3 (\u00e2)Wf (v + Lf ) = Wf \u03c0C (a)(v + Lf ).\n57\n\n\fLetting \u03c6 = [w1 , f ] and y = [w2 , f ] we find \u03c6y \u22121 = [w1 w2 , \u03b2w2 (f )], and a computation yields,\n\uf8f1\n(\nif w2 6\u223cf v\n\uf8f20\n\u2217 aw )f (w \u2217 v)\nf\n(w\n0\nif w2 6\u223cf v\n2\n\u22121\n1\n2\n\u2217\nf (w1 av)\n=\n\u00e2(\u03c6y )v\u0302(y) =\n=\n\u2217\n1/2\nif w2 \u223cf v\nf (w1 w1 ) f (w2 w2 ) \uf8f3\na\ncv(\u03c6) if w2 \u223cf v.\nf (w1\u2217 w1 )1/2\n\nTherefore, when s(\u03c6) = f , we have\n\n(\u00e2 \u22c6 v\u0302)(\u03c6) =\n\nX\n\n|y|\u2208G\ns(|y|)=f\n\n(\u00e2 \u229b v\u0302)(\u03c6, |y|) = a\ncv(\u03c6).\n\nSo for |y| \u2208 G with s(|y|) = f , |(\u00e2 \u22c6 v\u0302 \u2212 a\ncv)(|y|)| = 0. Then,\n\nbecause\n\nHence,\n\n\u00e2 \u22c6 v\u0302 + Nf = a\ncv + Nf\n\nk((\u00e2 \u22c6 v\u0302) \u2212 a\ncv) + Nf k2H\u03c3 =\n\nX\n\n|y|\u2208G\ns(|y|)=f\n\n|(\u00e2 \u22c6 v\u0302 \u2212 a\ncv)(|y|)|2 = 0.\n\n\u03c0\u03a3 (\u00e2)Wf (v + Lf ) = \u03c0\u03a3 (\u00e2)(v\u0302 + Nf ) = ac\nv + Nf = Wf (\u03c0C (a))(v + Lf ),\nwhich gives (38).\nb \u2212 \u00e2b\u0302\nThe definition of the norm on C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) and (38) imply that for a, b \u2208 C0 , ab\n\nC \u2217 (\u03a3,G)\n\n= 0.\n\nTherefore, the map a \u2208 C0 7\u2192 \u00e2 is multiplicative and\nk\u00e2kC \u2217 (\u03a3,G) =\n\nsup\n\n\u03c0C,f (a) .\n\nf \u2208S(C,D)\n\nThe existence of \u03b8 now follows from continuity, and the fact that ker \u03b8 = KF follows from Proposition 5.4. For v \u2208 N(C, D), \u03b8(v) = v\u0302 belongs to N(C \u2217 (\u03a3, G), C(G(\u25e6) )), so \u03b8 is a regular \u2217homomorphism.\nFinally, we turn to showing the G(\u25e6) -compatible density of \u03b8(C) in C \u2217 (\u03a3, G). Let M \u2286 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G)#\nbe the linear span of the evaluation functionals \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be(\u03c3) where \u03be \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) and \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3. Suppose\n\u03bc \u2208 M annihilates \u03b8(C). Then there exists n \u2208 N, scalars \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn , elements v1 , . . . , vn \u2208 N(C, D)\nand f1 , . . . , fn \u2208 F such that for any \u03be \u2208 C \u2217 (\u03a3, G),\n\u03bc(\u03be) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbk \u03be([vk , fk ]).\n\nk=1\n\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that [vi , fi ] 6= [vj , fj ] if i 6= j. Since \u03bc annilhlates \u03b8(C),\nfor every a \u2208 C0 ,\nn\nX\n\u03bbk [vk , fk ](a).\n0 = \u03bc(\u00e2) =\nk=1\n\nFix 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, and let d, e \u2208 D be such that \u03b2vj (fj )(d) = fj (e) = 1. For i 6= j, since [vi , fi ] 6= [vj , fj ],\neither fj 6= fi or \u03b2vi (fi ) 6= \u03b2vj (fj ). Hence we assume that d and e have been chosen so that if i 6= j,\nthen [vi , fi ](dvj e) = 0. Then\n\u03bc(v\u02c6j ) = \u03bbj fj (vj\u2217 vj )1/2 = 0.\n\nAs fj (vj\u2217 vj ) 6= 0, we obtain \u03bbj = 0. It follows that \u03bc = 0. Since the dual of C \u2217 (\u03a3, G) equipped with\nthe G(\u25e6) -compatible topology is M, we conclude that \u03b8(C) is dense in the G(\u25e6) -compatible topology\non C \u2217 (\u03a3, G). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n58\n\n\f9. Applications\nIn this section we give some applications which apply to regular MASA inclusions with L(C, D) =\n(0). Theorem 6.10 gives a very large class of such inclusions.\nHere is an application of our work to norming algebras. We begin with a definition. Recall that\nN(C, D) is a closed \u2217-semigroup containing D.\nDefinition 9.1. A \u2217-subsemigroup F \u2286 N(C, D) with D \u2286 F is countably generated over D if there\nexists a countable set F \u2286 F so that the smallest \u2217-subsemigroup of N(C, D) containing F \u222a D is\nF. The set F will be called a generating set for F.\nWe will say that the inclusion (C, D) is countably regular if there exists a \u2217-subsemigroup F \u2286\nN(C, D) such that F is countably generated over D and C = span(F).\nThe following result generalizes [28, Lemma 2.15] and gives a large class of norming algebras. In\nparticular, notice that the result holds for Cartan inclusions.\nTheorem 9.2. Suppose (C, D) is a regular MASA inclusion such that L(C, D) = (0). Then D\nnorms C.\nProof. Let F \u2286 N(C, D) be a \u2217-subsemigroup which is countably generated over D by the (countable) set F . Let CF \u2286 C be the C \u2217 -subalgebra generated by F. (Notice that CF is simply the closed\nlinear span of F.) Then (CF , D) is a countably regular MASA inclusion.\nWe will show that D norms CF . Let\nY := {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3 has a unique state extention to CF }.\nTheorem 3.8 shows that Y is dense in D\u0302. For each element \u03c3 \u2208 Y , let \u03c3 \u2032 denote the unique extension\n[ and \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u03c3, then \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c1 \u25e6 E because \u03c3 \u2032 |D = \u03c3 = \u03c1 \u25e6 E|D .\nof \u03c3 to all of CF . Notice that if \u03c1 \u2208 I(D)\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 Y , let \u03c0\u03c3 be the GNS representation for \u03c3 \u2032 . Proposition 4.14 shows that \u03c0\u03c3 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a\nMASA in B(H\u03c3 ).\nDefine an equivalence relation R on Y by \u03c31 \u223c \u03c32 if and only if there exists v \u2208 F such that\n\u03c32 = \u03b2v (\u03c31 ). (Since F is a \u2217-semigroup, this is an equivalence relation.)\nWe claim that if \u03c0\u03c31 is unitarily equivalent to \u03c0\u03c32 , then \u03c31 \u223c \u03c32 . To see this, we use a modification\nof the argument in [10, Lemma 5.8]. Let U \u2208 B(H\u03c32 , H\u03c31 ) be a unitary operator such that\nU \u2217 \u03c0\u03c31 U = \u03c0\u03c32 .\nLet L\u03c3i be the left kernel of \u03c3i\u2032 . Since \u03c0\u03c3i is irreducible, C/L\u03c3i = H\u03c3i . Hence we may find X \u2208 C\nsuch that U (I + L\u03c32 ) = X + L\u03c31 . Then for every x \u2208 C,\n\u03c32\u2032 (x) = h\u03c0\u03c32 (x)(I + L\u03c32 ), (I + L\u03c32 )i = \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 xX).\n[ such that \u03c1i \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u03c3i .\nFix \u03c1i \u2208 I(D)\nThe map C \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 x) is a non-zero linear bounded linear functional on C. Since span(F) is\ndense in C, there exists v \u2208 F so that \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 v) 6= 0. The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for completely\npositive maps shows that for any d \u2208 D,\n|\u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 vd)|2 = \u03c11 (E(X \u2217 vd)E(d\u2217 v \u2217 X)) \u2264 \u03c11 (E(X \u2217 vdd\u2217 v \u2217 X)) = \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 vdd\u2217 v \u2217 X) = \u03c32 (vdd\u2217 v \u2217 ).\nWhen d \u2208 D and \u03c31 (d) 6= 0, we have \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 vd) = \u03c31\u2032 (X \u2217 v)\u03c31 (d) 6= 0. Therefore, when d \u2208 D\nsatisfies \u03c31 (d) 6= 0,\n(39)\n\n0 < \u03c32 (vdd\u2217 v \u2217 ).\n\nIn particular, \u03c32 (vv \u2217 ) 6= 0. For any d \u2208 D, we have\n\u03b2v\u2217 (\u03c32 )(d) =\n59\n\n\u03c32 (vdv \u2217 )\n.\n\u03c32 (vv \u2217 )\n\n\fIf \u03b2v\u2217 (\u03c32 ) 6= \u03c31 , then there exists d \u2208 D with \u03c31 (dd\u2217 ) 6= 0 and \u03b2v\u2217 (dd\u2217 ) = 0. But this is impossible\nby (39). So \u03b2v\u2217 (\u03c32 ) = \u03c31 . Hence \u03c31 \u223c \u03c32 as claimed.\nThus, if \u03c31 6\u223c \u03c32 , then \u03c0\u03c31 and \u03c0\u03c32 are disjoint representations (as they are both irreducible).\nLet Y \u2286 Y be chosen so that Y contains exactly one element from each equivalence class of Y .\nPut\nM\n\u03c0=\n\u03c0\u03c3 .\n\u03c3\u2208Y\n\nThen\n(40)\n\nker \u03c0 =\n\n\\\n\nker \u03c0\u03c3 =\n\n\u03c3\u2208Y\n\n\\\n\nker \u03c0\u03c3 = {x \u2208 CF : \u03c3 \u2032 (z \u2217 x\u2217 xz) = 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 Y and all z \u2208 CF }.\n\n\u03c3\u2208Y\n\nWe next prove that\nL(CF , D) \u2287 ker \u03c0.\n\n(41)\n\nSuppose to obtain a contradiction, that x \u2208 ker \u03c0 and that E(x\u2217 x) is a non-zero element of I(D).\nLet\n[ : \u03c1(E(x\u2217 x)) > kE(x\u2217 x)k /2}.\nL := {\u03c1 \u2208 I(D)\nThen L is a clopen set. By Lemma 3.15, \u03b9\u2217 (L) = {\u03c3 \u2208 D\u0302 : \u03c3 = \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9 for some \u03c1 \u2208 L} has nonempty interior. Since Y is dense in D\u0302, we may find \u03c3 \u2208 Y and \u03c1 \u2208 L such that \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u03c3. Then\n\u03c3 \u2032 (x\u2217 x) = \u03c1(E(x\u2217 x)) 6= 0, so x \u2208\n/ ker \u03c0\u03c1 , contradicting (40). Hence (41) holds.\nSince L(C, D) \u2287 L(CF , D) \u2287 ker \u03c0, we see that \u03c0 is a faithful representation of CF .\nSince the representations in the definition of \u03c0 are disjoint and each \u03c0\u03c3 (D)\u2032\u2032 is a MASA in B(H\u03c3 ),\n\u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 is an atomic MASA in B(H\u03c0 ). Therefore, \u03c0(D)\u2032\u2032 is locally cyclic (see [29, p. 173]) for B(H\u03c0 ).\nBy [29, Theorem 2.7 and Lemma 2.3] \u03c0(D) norms B(H\u03c0 ). But then \u03c0(D) norms \u03c0(CF ). Since \u03c0 is\nfaithful, D norms CF .\nFinally, suppose that k \u2208 N and that x = (xij ) \u2208 Mn (C). For each n \u2208 N and i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k},\nP\nwe may find a finite set Fn,i,j \u2286 N(C, D) so that xij \u2212 v\u2208Fn,i,j v < 1/n. Let\nF = \u222a{Fn,i,j : n \u2208 N, i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k}}.\n\nThen F is countable. Let F be the closed \u2217-subsemigroup of N(C, D) generated by F and D. Then\nfor i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, xij \u2208 CF . Since D norms CF , we conclude that\nkxkMk (C) = kxkMk (CF ) = sup{kRxCk : R \u2208 M1,n (D), C \u2208 Mn,1 (D), kRk \u2264 1, kCk \u2264 1}.\nHence D norms C.\n\u0003\nFor any norm closed subalgebra A of the C \u2217 -algebra C, let C \u2217 (A) be the C \u2217 -subalgebra of C\ngenerated by A, and let Ce\u2217 (A) be the C \u2217 -envelope of A. (There are a number of references which\ndiscuss C \u2217 -envelopes; see [5, 11, 27].)\nThe following result is a significant generalization of [10, Theorem 4.21]. Theorem 9.3 was\nobserved by Vrej Zarikian, who has kindly consented to its inclusion here.\nTheorem 9.3. Let C and D be C \u2217 -algebras, with D \u2286 C (D is not assumed abelian). Let (I(D), \u03b9)\nbe an injective envelope for D. Suppose there exists a unique unital completely positive map \u03a6 : C \u2192\nI(D) such that \u03a6|D = \u03b9, and assume also that \u03a6 is faithful. Let A be a norm-closed (not necessarily\nself-adjoint) subalgebra of C such that D \u2286 A \u2286 C. Then the C \u2217 -subalgebra of C generated by A is\nthe C \u2217 -envelope of A.\n60\n\n\fProof. Let \u03b8 : A \u2192 Ce\u2217 (A) be a unital completely isometric (unital) homomorphism such that\nthe C \u2217 -algebra generated by the image of \u03b8 is Ce\u2217 (A). Then there exists a unique \u2217-epimorphism\nq : C \u2217 (A) \u2192 Ce\u2217 (A) such that q|A = \u03b8. Our task is to show that q is one-to-one.\nSince I(D) is injective in the category of operator systems and completely contractive maps,\nthere exists a unital completely contractive map \u03a6e : Ce\u2217 (A) \u2192 I(D) such that \u03a6e \u25e6 \u03b8 = \u03b9. Also,\nthere exists a unital completely contractive map \u2206 : C \u2192 I(D) so that \u2206|C \u2217 (A) = \u03a6e \u25e6 q. Then for\nd \u2208 D, we have \u03b8(d) = q(d), so \u03b9(d) = \u03a6e (\u03b8(d)) = \u03a6e (q(d)) = \u2206(d). The uniqueness of \u03a6 gives\n\u2206 = \u03a6. Then if x \u2208 C \u2217 (A) and q(x) = 0, we have \u03a6(q(x\u2217 x)) = 0, so q(x\u2217 x) = 0 by the faithfulness\nof \u03a6. Thus q is one-to-one, and the proof is complete.\n\u0003\nWe now obtain the following generalization of [28, Theorem 2.16]. While the outline of the proof\nis the same as the proof of [28, Theorem 2.16], the details in obtaining norming subalgebras are\ndifferent.\nTheorem 9.4. For i = 1, 2, suppose that (Ci , Di ) are regular MASA inclusions such that L(Ci , Di ) =\n(0) and that Ai \u2286 Ci are norm closed subalgebras such that Di \u2286 Ai \u2286 Ci . Let C \u2217 (Ai ) be the C \u2217 subalgebra of Ci generated by Ai . If u : A1 \u2192 A2 is an isometric isomorphism, then u extends\nuniquely to a \u2217-isomorphism of C \u2217 (A1 ) onto C \u2217 (A2 ).\nProof. Theorem 9.2 implies that Di norms Ci . Taken together, Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 9.3\nimply that C \u2217 (Ai ) is the C \u2217 -envelope of Ai . Finally, an application of [28, Corollary 1.5] completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1.
