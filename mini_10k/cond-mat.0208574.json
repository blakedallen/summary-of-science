Motivated by the scientific challenge to understand\nthe nature of complex systems, physicists have started\nto direct their attentions to a huge, and also growing\namount of economics data recorded minutes by minutes\nfor decades. Among these interesting data, the fluctuation of stock exchange indices is of special interest, since\nit might indirectly reflect the economic situation in a\ncertain region and some people happily speculate their\nmoney on it. Furthermore, the advancement in computing capabilities has enabled them to handle a large\namount of data, unlike almost 40 years ago when Mandelbrot investigated approximately 2000 data points of\ncotton prices [15].\nIt is then expected that such studies could explain the\nnature of interacting elements in the complex system and,\ntherefore, could help to forecast economic fluctuations in\nthe future. In other words, these studies were intended\nto produce new results in economics, which might help us\nto avoid economic \"earthquakes\" such as what happened\nin Indonesia a few years ago [16].\nPrevious studies in this subject so far have focused only\non the long-term behavior of the leading stock indices.\nThis is understandable, since to statistically investigate\nthe universal features in economic activities one has to\nhave a large amount of data. Very little attentions are\ngiven to investigate what happen to the stock markets\nin developing countries (e.g., Indonesia) as well as what\nhappen to the stock indices before, during, and after a\nfinancial (or monetary) crash, although in the latter the\nmost important ingredients of the financial market or economic fluctuation could exist [10, 11, 12].\nIt is the objective of this paper to study the general\nstatistical properties of the fluctuation in stock indices\nin two developing countries, as well as their properties\nbefore and after a financial crashes. This study is important in order to investigate the extent of the universality of complex behavior found previously in the leading\n\nstock indices, such as S&P 500 and NYSE. Such investigation will naturally shed important information on the\nvariation of the universal constants in the scaling behavior of the stock index. With this information at hand\nit is then possible to identify the statistical properties\nthat quantify different behaviors in stock markets and\nthose which indicate a crash or stable condition. For this\npurpose we take two different indices, the Jakarta Stock\nExchange Index (abbreviated with IHSG, an acronym of\nIndeks Harga Saham Gabungan or composite stock exchange price index) and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange index (KLSE), which belong to different countries. Comparing the two indices would be very interesting since both Indonesia and Malaysia underwent the\n\n300\n250\n\nGDP (Billions USD)\n\nI.\n\n228.2\n209.4\n\n200\n\nIndonesia\n198.2\n\n150\n111.6\n\n104.9\n100\n\nMalaysia\n\n97.1\n\n50\n0\n250\n\nPopulation (Million)\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0208574v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 29 Aug 2002\n\nT.

The vertical line indicates\nthe year when the monetary and financial crisis started to occur in the Asia region. In both countries the financial crisis\nwas started on July 1997, the impact was naturally recorded\nas the 1998 GDP. Data are taken from [17].\n\n\f2\nsame monetary crisis in 1997, which are then followed\nby financial crashes in almost all economic sectors, but\nwith quite different economic situations. As has been often discussed, the behavior of two stock indices could be\nvery different although the two stock markets are situated in the same region.\nBefore proceeding to the analysis, it is worth to glance\nat the Indonesian and Malaysian Gross Domestic Products (GDP) shown in Fig. 1. Before the crisis the growth\nrate of the Indonesian GDP seems to be faster than that\nof Malaysian GDP. The monetary crisis in 1997 has a\nclear impact on both GDPs. Nevertheless, the impact\non Indonesian GDP is more obvious. After the crisis,\nMalaysia was rather successful to stabilize its economic\nsituation and did not accept the International Monetary Fund (IMF) prescription. Three years after that\nMalaysia was able to put its GDP slightly above the\nprevious value in 1997. On the other hand, Indonesia\nwas unable to stop the declination of Rupiah against US\nDollar and decided to ask the IMF to help stabilizing\nits monetary condition. Other crises, which followed the\nmonetary crisis, are blamed as the reasons of this.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nGENERAL PROPERTIES\nTime Series and Index Returns\n\nIn our analysis we investigate the daily index returns,\nwhich are defined as\nZ\u2206t (t) = ln Y (t + \u2206t) \u2212 ln Y (t)\n= ln [Y (t + \u2206t)/Y (t)],\n\n(1)\n\nwith Y (t) indicates the closing index of the stock at day\nt. Some previous studies [6, 7] are performed with the return defined as the difference in the index, instead of the\ndifference in the logarithm of index as given by Eq. (1).\nHowever, in our analysis we found that the results of\ncalculations by using both methods do not differ significantly.\nThe available data for the IHSG index are the daily\nclosing index data recorded from January 1988 to April\n2002 which consist of 3526 data points. The KLSE data\ncontain also the daily closing index starting from December 1993 and ending with June 2002, which comprise\ntotally 2104 data points. The number of data in both indices seems to be the first obstacle in this analysis, since\ncompared with the previous analysis on the S&P 500 index, e.g. Ref. [9], which used approximately 5 \u00d7 106\ndata points, the number turns out to be extremely small.\nHowever, as shown by Mandelbrot in his analysis on the\ncotton prices, even with about 2000 data points it is still\npossible to extract a quantitative conclusion from the\ndata.\nFigure 2 shows the time series of the IHSG index along\nwith the logarithmic returns calculated by using Eq. (1).\nIt is naturally difficult to define when exactly the crisis\n\n(or crash) started and when it finished. To get around\nthis difficulty, in Fig. 2 we also display the historical time\nseries of the exchange rate between 1000 Indonesian Rupiah and 1 US Dollar, since the economic crash started\nwith the decline of this rate. The available data do not fill\nthe entire range, nevertheless they are sufficient to locate\nthe period of the crisis. It should be noted that before\nthe monetary crisis the government intervention on this\nexchange rate was very strong and as a consequence, although the Rupiah was not pegged to US Dollar with a\nfixed rate, the fluctuation in the exchange rate was relatively tiny.\nIn Fig. 2 we indicate the period when Rupiah started\nto continuously drop (10th July 1997) until it reached the\nminimum point (23rd January 1998). The IHSG index\nalso dropped significantly during this period. However,\nthe index continued to strongly fluctuate and reached\nanother minimum about one year later due to the unfortunate political situation. The same phenomenon also\nhappened in the foreign exchange rate, though with a\ndifferent scale. In view of this, according to the IHSG index, the duration of financial crisis could be longer than\none year.\nFigure 3 displays the historical time series of the KLSE\nindex along with their logarithmic returns and the ratio\nbetween 1 Malaysian Ringgit and 1 US Dollar. Coincidentally, our definition of the crash period fits nicely\nwith the latter. As in the case of IHSG, the KLSE index also significantly dropped during this period. The\ndifference between Indonesian and Malaysian foreign exchange rate is, nevertheless, apparent here, since on 1st\nSeptember 1998 Malaysia imposed currency controls, the\nRinggit was pegged with US Dollar with a fixed rate of\n3.80 Ringgit per Dollar, while Indonesia was unable to do\nthat due to the multi-crisis that simultaneously occurred\nin this country. From Fig. 3 it is not clear whether or not\nsuch policy helped to elevate the KLSE index, since comparing with the IHSG fluctuation in Fig. 2 the two indices\nseem to be strongly correlated, thus other external factors could be more relevant to explain the improvement\nin the KLSE index. In fact, Ref. [18] claims that the policy has led to a misposition of the Ringgit relative to\nits realistic exchange rate. During 1999 the Ringgit was\novervalued since the regional currencies such as Japan\nYen and Singapore Dollar have all depreciated against\nUS Dollar. As a consequence, Malaysian export became\nless competitive and eventually this policy led to an economic slowdown in Malaysia.\nA quick glance to the index fluctuation Y (t) in both\nfigures reveals that the fluctuation is more dramatic than\nthat of S&P 500, indicating that in this case the situation is more complex. After the crash the magnitude of\nreturns Z(t) is obviously larger in both indices, or, in the\neconomics language, the probability to gain or to loose\nbecomes larger than before. In the next section, it will\nbe shown that both indices are clearly more volatile after\nthe crash.\n\n\f3\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n1000 IDR / 1 USD\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nR(t)\n\nR(t)\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\nKuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Index\n\n1400\n\nJakarta Stock Exchange Index (IHSG)\n\n(KLSE)\n\n1200\n\n600\n\nY(t)\n\nY(t)\n\n1 RM / 1 USD\n\n0.0\n\n800\n\n400\n\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n\n200\n\n21 Sep. 1998\n\n200\n\n\u2193\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n10 Jul. 1997\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2190\n\n1 Sep. 1998\n\n\u2193\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n\u2192\n\n10 Jul. 1997\n\n0.2\n\n\u2190\n\n23 Jan. 1998\n\n23 Jan. 1998\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nZ(t)\n\nZ(t)\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n\n-0.1\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.3\n88\n\n89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92\n\n93\n\n94\n\n95\n\n96\n\n97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n00\n\n01\n\n02\n\n93\n\n94\n\n95\n\n96\n\nt\n\n97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n00\n\n01\n\n02\n\nt\n\nFIG. 2: The ratio between 1000 Indonesian Rupiah and 1\nUS Dollar (top), the Jakarta Stock Exchange Index (IHSG)\nY (t) (middle) and the logarithmic return Z(t) calculated from\nEq.

The advantage of such analysis is obvious, since the number of\ndata included is relatively small, while the probability is\nlargest at Z = 0, thus reducing the statistical inaccuracies.\nStarting with the characteristic function [7]\n\u03c6(\u2206t) = e\u2212\u03b3\u2206t|q| ,\n\u03b1\n\nthe L\u00e9vy stable distribution is given by\nZ\n1 \u221e \u2212\u03b3\u2206t|q|\u03b1\nP (Z) =\ne\ncos(qZ) dq .\n\u03c0 0\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u0393(1/\u03b1)\n,\n\u03c0\u03b1(\u03b3\u2206t)1/\u03b1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u0393 indicates the Gamma function.\nThe log-log plots of P (0) as a function of the sampling\ntime \u2206t for both IHSG and KLSE indices are shown in\nthe left panels of Fig. 4. Since the number of data points\nis relatively small we limit our analysis only up to \u2206t =\n19 days for the IHSG index and \u2206t = 13 days for KLSE.\nIn the former (latter) case the number of data points in\neach set decreases from 3526 (2104) for \u2206t = 1 day to the\nvalue of 181 for \u2206t = 19 days (160 for \u2206t = 13 days).\nThese values are already much smaller compared with\nprevious analyses, e.g., for the Hang Seng index [14] one\nends up with the value of 1481 for \u2206t = 128 minutes.\nThe slopes of linear regressions to these plots equal the\nnegative inverse of the L\u00e9vy stable distribution indices \u03b1.\n\n\f4\n1/\u03b1 = 0.7374\nIHSG (3526)\n\n100\n\n100\n\nIHSG (3526)\n\u03c3 = 0.0187\n\n-3\n\n\u03b3 = 1.383\u00d710\n\nP(Z)\n\nP(0)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n1\n1\n\n0.01\n-10\n\n100\n\n1/\u03b11 = 0.5736\n1/\u03b12 = 1.0918\n1/\u03b13 = 0.4145\nKLSE (2104)\n\n100\n10\n\nP(Z)\n\n100\n\nP(0)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nKLSE (2104)\n-4\n\u03b31 = 1.787\u00d710\n\u03c3 = 0.0196\n-2\n\u03b32 = 1.240\u00d710\n-6\n\u03b33 = 6.433\u00d710\n\n1\n0.1\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n\u2206 t (day)\n\n100\n\n0.01\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nZ /\u03c3\n\nFIG. 4: Left panels: Log-log plots of the IHSG (top) and\nKLSE (bottom) probability of return to the origin as a function of the sampling time \u2206t. Solid curves show linear regressions to this probability. The dashed curve in the case of\nKLSE shows another possibility if one uses only the first three\npoints in the linear regression, whereas the dotted curve is a\nlinear regression by excluding the first point (\u2206t = 1). The\nslopes of these lines, which are equal to negative inverse of the\nL\u00e9vy stable distribution indices, are shown in the left panels.\nRight panels: Comparison between normalized distribution\nfunctions for \u2206t = 1 and normalized L\u00e9vy stable distributions (solid and dashed lines) with parameters obtained from\nthe left figures. The standard deviation and the number of\ndata are shown in the right panels.\n\nUsing this index we calculate the parameter \u03b3 by means\nof Eq. (4) and plot the \"theoretical\" PDF as a function\nof normalized returns Z/\u03c3, using Eq. (3), where \u03c3 the\nstandard deviation of the distribution, and compare it\nwith the empirical PDF obtained from data in the right\npanels of Fig. 4. All relevant parameters obtained in this\ncalculation are displayed in Table I.\nIn the IHSG case we obtain m = \u22120.7374 (corresponds\nto \u03b1 = 1.3561) which is slightly smaller than that of\nthe S&P 500 index obtained from the same analysis [7]\n(\u03b1 = 1.40), or using different approach [9] ( \u03b1 = 1.60 \u2013\n3.45). The value is also smaller than the result obtained\nfor Hang Seng index (\u03b1 = 1.619) [14]. The value indicates\nthat the central part of the IHSG distribution can be\ndescribed by a L\u00e9vy stable process.\nIn the KLSE case the situation is rather different as\ndepicted by the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The PDF at zero\nreturn shows a cross-over at \u2206t between 1 and 2 and,\nas a consequence, as shown by the solid line the linear\nregression to the points does not lead to a satisfactory\nresult. To clarify this, we use the three first points in the\nsecond regression and excluding the P (Z = 0, \u2206t = 1)\n\ndata point in the third one. The results are compared\nwith the linear regression to all points in the bottom-left\npanel of Fig. 4. In the first case we obtain \u03b1 = 1.7433,\nalready close to a Gaussian distribution although still\nwithin the L\u00e9vy stable index. In the second case the\nindex \u03b1 is smaller, indicating that the distribution for\nsmall \u2206t is far from Gaussian. However, in the third case\nthe distribution is already a Gaussian unstable process.\nFrom this result, clearly we can conclude that by slightly\nincreasing \u2206t the KLSE index does not retain its power\nlaw and quickly converges to a Gaussian distribution, in\ncontrast to the IHSG index. The PDF behavior for the\nthree cases is clearly seen in the bottom-right panel of\nFig. 4.\nThe standard deviation \u03c3 is known as the historical\nvolatility in financial literatures and quantifies the risk\nassociated with the corresponding stock [23]. As shown\nin the first line of Table I, the KLSE stock is slightly\nriskier than the IHSG one. The kurtosis measures the\nrelative peakedness of the distribution to a Gaussian one.\nThe PDF of the less capitalized stocks is more leptokurtic than the PDF of the more capitalized ones [23]. From\nTable I we can clearly see that the IHSG stock is less\ncapitalized than KLSE. Finally, the skewness characterizes the degree of asymmetry of the distribution from its\nmean. A positive value of skewness indicates that the\nstock delivered more profits along its history, whereas a\nnegative value displays more losses hit the investor. Table I reveals that the IHSG stock in general gives more\nprofits than the KLSE one.\nAlthough numerical values given in Table I could be interesting, the values become much more important when\nwe discuss the behavior of the stock indices before and\nafter the financial crash in the next section.\nTo further explore statistical properties of the PDF\nof index returns we follow Refs. [6, 7], i.e. we investigate\nthe stability of the distribution for \u2206t > 1 day. Assuming\nthe central part of the distribution can be described by a\nL\u00e9vy stable distribution, then using the scaling variables\nP \u2032 (Z) = P (Z)(\u2206t)1/\u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nand\nZ \u2032 (t) =\n\nZ(t)\n,\n(\u2206t)1/\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nthe empirical PDFs for different time sampling \u2206t will\ncollapse onto the \u2206t = 1 distribution.\nThe results for both indices are displayed in Fig. 5,\nwhere we perform the analysis for \u2206t < 20 days. In general the data collapse is evident, especially in the case of\nIHSG. In the KLSE case we use \u03b1 = 1.7433 (result from\nregression to all empirical P (0) in Fig. 4), since the value\nleads to an average behavior. As Ref. [14] has reported,\nwe also find that the extent of data collapse is stronger in\nthe center of the distribution. The existence of a crossover in the KLSE case is also observed here, the scaled\nP \u2032 (Z) are more scattered than that of the IHSG.\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Summary of general statistical properties of the IHSG and KLSE returns Z(t). Linear regression to the probability\ndensity function at zero return PDF(0) as a function of \u2206t shown in Fig. 4 yields a line y = mx + n, where m = \u22121/\u03b1.

In the case of the S&P 500 index the result\nis found to be consistent with the analysis of the tails\nof cumulative distributions. They pointed out that the\nchange in the moments behavior originates from the gradual disappearance of the L\u00e9vy slope in the distribution\ntails. In our case it is also important to cross-check the\nresults shown in Fig. 4, especially the KLSE slope, which\nis found to be non-linear in the range of \u2206t = 1 \u2212 10.\nIt has been shown in Ref. [9] that Eq. (7) will diverge\nfor k \u2265 3. In this study we also constrain k within\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 3. The result for both indices compared with the\nmoment obtained from a Gaussian distribution are shown\nin Fig. 6. Obviously the results are consistent with our\nprevious analysis, the IHSG moment retains its scaling up\nto \u2206t = 9 days, only after \u2206t = 13 the moment starts to\ndeviate toward the Gaussian distribution. In the KLSE\ncase the moment quickly converges to the Gaussian distribution as \u2206t increases from 1 day and does not show\nany scaling behavior as in the former case.\nD.\n\nC.\n\n(8)\n\n0.2\n\nZ(t)\n\n\u03b1 = 0.7374\n\nZ(t) \u2212 hZ(t)i\n,\nhZ 2 (t)i \u2212 hZ(t)i2\n\nCorrelation in the stock index\n\nMoments\n\nReference [9] has pointed out that the use of the return probability to the origin PDF(0) to estimate the\nL\u00e9vy stable distribution index \u03b1 is statistically not optimal, due to discreteness of the distribution.

The only difference is observed in the power exponent of the scaling, the\nIHSG correlation falls off faster than the KLSE one. This\nis, however, in contrast to their short-range correlation.\nNote that Refs. [4, 9] fitted the long-range autocorrelation to the function in the form of a/(1 + \u03c4 b ) .

The volatility of the stock index is a measure\nof how much the index is likely to fluctuate. Information on the stock volatility is very important for investors\nsince it quantifies the risk factor and it is also an important input of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThere are many different definitions of the volatility in\nfinancial literatures [24].

It is obvious that after\nthe drop of the foreign exchange rate finished in 23rd January 1998 volatilities of both indices are still large until\nthe indices reached their minimum values in September\n1998. From that on, the volatility decreases gradually\nalthough until 2002 the values are still larger than the\nvalues before the crash.\nIt is also obvious from Fig. 9 that before 1997 the IHSG\nstock had a rather stable volatility variation, while on the\nother hand the variation in the KLSE case was already\ndramatic. In general, the two stocks maintain these behaviors after the crash, although in this period the averaged volatilities are larger than before. This might explain why the IHSG stock index is found to be more\ncorrelated than the KLSE one.\nIII.\n\n1\n\nSTATISTICAL PROPERTIES BEFORE AND\nAFTER CRASH\n\nIn section II we have shown that between July 1997 and\nSeptember 1998 the index returns of both stocks fluctuate\nstrongly. As shown in Fig. 9, compared with the situations before and after this period, both indices become\nmore volatile. A more quantitative description can be\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n\u2206 t (day)\n\n100\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nZ /\u03c3\n\nFIG. 10: Same as in Fig. 4 but for the IHSG case before,\nduring, and after the financial crash.\n\nobtained from Table II, where in the first line we average\nthe index volatility over all times before 10th July 1997,\n16 month after that (during which the volatility of both\nindices is significantly large), and over the rest of data,\nrespectively. The result confirms the finding of Ref. [23],\nnamely the volatility of a stock index tends to be large\nright after the crash and in a relatively long period after\nthat. This also happens to both stock indices, i.e. almost five years after the financial crisis both stocks are\nstill more volatile than before.\nIn the financial literature the volatility is often calculated from the standard deviation of the returns distribution [24]. In Table II we also present the standard\ndeviations of the IHSG and KLSE index returns distributions in all three cases. Table II indicates that both\ndefinitions are consistent in our analysis.\nFrom the kurtosis of stock indices we can see that the\nIHSG stock is more capitalized after the crash, whereas\nthe KLSE stock displays a very different behavior. Nevertheless, the skewness of their distributions shows a similar\ntendency, both stocks deliver less profits after the crash,\nalthough more profits could be obtained from the KLSE\n\n\f8\nTABLE II: Statistical properties of IHSG and KLSE stock indices before, during, and after crash.\nIHSG\n\nKLSE\n\nProperties\nAverage volatility\nStandard deviation \u03c3\nKurtosis\nSkewness\n\u03b3\nN\n\nBefore crash\n0.0192\n0.0167\n183.421\n6.8706\n7.581 \u00d7 10\u22124\n2347\n\nDuring crash\n0.0327\n0.0300\n2.849\n0.1417\n2.891 \u00d7 10\u22123\n296\n\nAfter crash\n0.0260\n0.0185\n4.377\n0.7079\n9.723 \u00d7 10\u22126\n883\n\nKLSE\n100\n\nBefore crash (889)\n\u03b1-1 = 0.3971\n\n3.0\n\n100\n\nBefore crash (889)\n\n2.5\n\n\u03c3 = 0.0127\n\n2.0\n\n10\n\n\u03bc(k)\n\nP(Z)\n\nP(0)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n100\n\n10\n\n0.01\n-10\n\n100\n\nDuring crash (284)\n\u03b1-1 = 0.5391\n\n100\n\nP(Z)\n\nP(0)\n\nIHSG\n\u2206t=1\n\u2206t=2\n\u2206t=3\n\u2206t=4\n\u2206t=6\n\u2206t=9\n\u2206 t = 13\n\u2206 t = 19\nGaussian\n\nDuring crash (296)\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\nk\n\nFIG. 12: Moments of the distribution of IHSG normalized\nreturns before, during, and after crash.\n\n100\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2.0\n\n\u03bc(k)\n\nAfter crash (933)\n\u03b1-1 = 0.6559\n\n100\n\n3.0\n\n10\n\n0.1\n-10\n\n100\n\n2.0\n\nk\n\nDuring crash (284)\n\n2.5\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\nk\n\n10\n\n3.0\n\n1\n\nAfter crash (883)\n\nBefore crash (2347)\n0.0\n0.0\n\nKLSE\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAfter crash\n0.0237\n0.0197\n42.925\n\u22120.2529\n2.755 \u00d7 10\u22124\n993\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c3 = 0.0323\n\n10\n\nDuring crash\n0.0341\n0.0323\n8.152\n1.0644\n3.109 \u00d7 10\u22124\n284\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nBefore crash\n0.0219\n0.0127\n6.775\n0.2053\n9.339 \u00d7 10\u22126\n889\n\nAfter crash (933)\n\u03c3 = 0.0197\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206t=1\n\u2206t=2\n\u2206t=3\n\u2206t=4\n\u2206t=6\n\u2206t=9\n\u2206 t = 13\n\u2206 t = 19\nGaussian\n\nDuring crash (284)\n\nAfter crash (933)\n\n1.0\n\nP(Z)\n\nP(0)\n\n10\n10\n\n0.5\nBefore crash (889)\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\nk\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\nk\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\nk\n\n0.1\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n\u2206 t (day)\n\n100\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nZ /\u03c3\n\nFIG. 13: Same as in Fig. 12, but for the KLSE index.\n\nFIG. 11: As in Fig. 10, but for the KLSE stock index.\n\nstock during the crash.\nIt is clearly tempting to investigate whether or not the\nuniversal properties found in section II still exist in all\nperiods and to ask what kind of differences might quantify these conditions. The answer can be found in Figs. 10\nand 11. Obviously in all cases the statistical accuracies\nare not as good as in the previous section, when we used\nall data in our analyses. Nevertheless, in spite of the\nvery limited data points used in our analysis, the mes-\n\nsage from Figs. 10 and 11 is clear, the universal properties\nof the returns distribution retain their existences in all\ncases. Linear regression to the IHSG probability of the\nreturn to the origin reveals the fact that the distribution\nturns from L\u00e9vy to Gaussian after the crash. Surprisingly, the KLSE stock index shows a contrary result, the\ndistribution alters from a Gaussian to a L\u00e9vy one after\nthe crash.\nA cross-check to the result shown in Figs. 10 and 11 is\ninevitable, since the number of data could significantly\nlimit statistical accuracies in this case. For this purpose\nin Figs. 12 and 13 we display the moments of both stock\n\n\f9\n1\n\nIHSG\n\n0.8\n\nBefore crash\nDuring crash\nAfter crash\n\nC\u2206 t (\u03c4 )\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n1\n\nKLSE\n\n0.8\n\nBefore crash\nDuring crash\nAfter crash\n\nmemory.\nIt might be more interesting if we compare results in\nthis section with currency controls shown in the top panels of Figs. 2 and 3. The government interventions on the\nexchange rate seem to create non natural economics activities which have a direct influence on the fluctuation of\nstock indices. Once the currency is under-controlled, the\nfluctuations tend to significantly deviate from the Gaussian distribution, which can be clearly seen in the IHSG\nmoment before crash (Fig. 12) and the KLSE one after\ncrash (Fig. 13). From the investors point of view this\nis obvious, a less fluctuating exchange rate reduces the\nnumber of variables considered in estimating the future\nstock price.\n\nC\u2206 t (\u03c4 )\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u03c4 (day)\n\nFIG. 14: Short range autocorrelation functions of the IHSG\nand KLSE index returns before, during, and after crash.\n\nindices in the case of before, during, and after the financial crash. A consistent result is obtained from these figures, in the case of IHSG the distribution becomes closer\nto Gaussian during and after crash, whereas the KLSE\nmoments move away from the Gaussian distribution after\nthe crash.\nAnother important finding obtained from Fig. 12 is\nthat the scaling behavior up to \u2206t = 9 shown by the\nIHSG case in the previous section originates from the\nperiod before crash. After the crash, the IHSG moments\nquickly converge to a Gaussian distribution. In fact, this\nphenomenon has already been seen in the left panels of\nFig. 10, where the empirical probability of return to the\norigin is more scattered in the crash periods and after\nthat.\nAs in the previous section, investigation of the autocorrelation function from both stocks might also be of\ninterest. The corresponding autocorrelation is shown in\nFig. 14. Although it is difficult to see how long the KLSE\nstock maintains its correlation, the IHSG stock index\nobviously becomes less correlated during and after the\ncrash. This result can be understood by looking back\nto Fig. 12, i.e. after the crash the returns distribution\nbecomes more random and therefore the index losses its\n\n[1] D. Canning, L.A.N. Amaral, Y.

Lett. 60, 335 (1995).\n\nWe have analyzed the IHSG and KLSE stock index returns using the methods developed for statistical physics.\nIn spite of the limited number of data used in our analysis, we still found that both stock indices show the universal properties previously observed in the leading stocks\nsuch as S&P 500 and NYSE, i.e. the scaling properties.\nThe difference is, nevertheless, found in the time scale,\nthe IHSG stock retains its scaling property longer than\nthe KLSE one. As a consequence, the former is more\ncorrelated than the latter.\nBy investigating their statistical properties before, during, and after the financial crash it is found that the\nscaling behavior of the IHSG index originates from its\nfluctuation before the crash period. During and after the\ncrash periods the index distributions are closer to Gaussian and do not show a stable process. In the KLSE case,\nthe return distributions in all periods show an unstable\nprocess and depart from Gaussian after the crash. One\npossible explanation to these different behaviors could\nbe the currency control. Besides these differences, both\nstock indices show some similarities, namely both stocks\nbecome more volatile during and after the crash and their\nreturn moments become closer to Gaussian during the\ncrash.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the Quality for\nUndergraduate Education (QUE) project.
