We also discuss the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty of our approach.\nJune 2000\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt present, the focus of electroweak Standard Model tests lies on W-boson-pair production at LEP2, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f [ 1, 2, 3]. While the invariant-mass distributions\nof the final-state fermion pairs allow for precise measurements of the W-boson mass, the\ntotal cross section and the angular distributions can be used to obtain information on\nthe non-abelian couplings of the W bosons. LEP2 provides us with O(104 ) W-boson\npairs, thus leading to a typical experimental accuracy of 1% [ 3]. At a future e+ e\u2212 linear\ncollider, the W-boson yield could be increased by two orders of magnitude [ 4], and the\nexperimental accuracy will reach the level of some 0.1%.\nThe Monte Carlo generators used in the past [ 5] for W-pair production are based\non the lowest-order matrix elements and typically include only the universal electroweak\ncorrections. These comprise the running of the electromagnetic coupling, corrections associated with the \u03c1 parameter, the Coulomb singularity close to threshold, and photonic\ncorrections in leading-logarithmic approximation. For the total cross section these generators have a precision at the level of 1\u20132% at LEP2 energies [ 6, 7, 8]; for distributions\nthe accuracy in general is worse. While this was sufficient for the analysis of LEP2 data\nin the past, it becomes already insufficient for the present analysis and will be definitely\ninadequate for the final LEP2 analysis. Since the non-universal corrections increase with\nenergy, the accuracy of generators including only universal corrections is at the level of\n5\u201320% [ 8] in the total cross section and thus not adequate at linear collider energies.\n< 0.5% at not too large energies1 ,\nIn this paper we aim at a theoretical accuracy of \u223c\nwhich is sufficient for LEP2 and reasonable for a 500 GeV linear collider. This requires,\non the one hand, to include the complete set of lowest-order diagrams for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f ,\nwhich is already implemented in many existing generators. Moreover, the complete O(\u03b1)\ncorrections for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f have to be taken into account, and care must be taken\nthat also the leading higher-order corrections are included.\nThe full treatment of the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f at the one-loop level is of enormous\ncomplexity. Nevertheless, there is ongoing work in this direction [ 9]. Moreover, the\nrequirement to include the finite width of the W bosons poses severe theoretical problems\nwith gauge invariance.\nAn economic approach for the calculation of the O(\u03b1) corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192\n4f consists in using the double-pole approximation (DPA). In DPA, only those terms are\nkept that are enhanced by two resonant W propagators and thus by a factor MW /\u0393W\nwith respect to all other contributions. With respect to the leading contributions, the\ncorrections to the non-doubly-resonant contributions are typically of the order \u03b1/\u03c0 \u00d7\n\u0393W /MW . Even when taking into account a conservative safety factor, this approximation\nis sufficient for our precision tag of 0.5% as long as the doubly-resonant contributions\ndominate the cross section. This is the case at LEP2 energies sufficiently above threshold\nif forward-scattered electrons or positrons in the final state (single-W production2 ) and,\nfor processes involving the neutral current, fermion\u2013antifermion pairs with low invariant\nmasses are excluded. At higher energies, where diagrams without two resonant W bosons\n1\n\nAbove 0.5\u20131 TeV at least the leading electroweak logarithms at the two-loop level should be taken\ninto account.\n2\nA discussion of state-of-the-art calculations for single-W production can be found in Ref. [ 3].\n\n1\n\n\fbecome more sizeable, it may be necessary to suppress those by appropriate cuts, e.g.\ninvariant-mass cuts, on the final-state fermions. These types of cuts must be applied\nanyhow in order to extract the physically interesting WW signal.\nThe DPA has several advantages as far as the virtual corrections are concerned. Besides reducing the number of diagrams drastically, it naturally provides a gauge-invariant\nanswer. In contrast to the corrections to the full process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f , the virtual corrections in DPA depend on the fermion flavours of the final state in a universal way,\ni.e. there is only one generic set of diagrams for all final states. Moreover, the invariant\nfunctions that build up the corrections do not depend on the decay angles but only on\nthe production angle of the W bosons, thus allowing to speed up their calculation in the\nMonte Carlo generators considerably. Finally, the virtual factorizable corrections in DPA\ncan be directly obtained from the existing results for on-shell W-pair production [ 10, 11]\nand W-boson decay [ 12, 13]. The virtual non-factorizable corrections, i.e. those virtual\ncorrections that cannot be associated with either W-pair production or W-boson decay,\nhave a simple structure [ 14, 15, 16, 17].\nOn the other hand, the definition of the DPA is problematic for the bremsstrahlung\ncorrections. Photon radiation from the initial and from the final state leads to W propagators that become resonant at different locations in phase space. The situation depends\non the regime of the photon energy. If the radiated photons are hard (E\u03b3 \u226b \u0393W ), these\nlocations are well separated, and the photon radiation can be unambiguously assigned\nto the W-pair production subprocess (at least theoretically) or to one of the W-decay\nsubprocesses. For soft photons (E\u03b3 \u226a \u0393W ), the resonances coincide, and the DPA is\nidentical to the one without photon. However, for semi-soft photons (E\u03b3 \u223c \u0393W ), the\nresonant propagators overlap, and it is not obvious how the DPA can be applied without\nomitting or double-counting doubly-resonant contributions. For these reasons, we have\npreferred to employ the exact e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 matrix element for the real bremsstrahlung\ncorrections and the exact e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f matrix element for the soft and collinear singular\nvirtual corrections, and to apply the DPA only to the non-leading part of the virtual\ncorrections. Furthermore, all observables for real photons are based on a full lowest-order\ncalculation for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 3 .\nA possible strategy for a DPA for the O(\u03b1) corrections to pair production of unstable\nparticles was already proposed in Ref. [ 18]. Recently different versions of DPAs have\nbeen used in the literature.\nA first complete calculation of the O(\u03b1) corrections for off-shell W-pair production,\nincluding a numerical study of leptonic final states, was presented in Ref. [ 19]. In that\nwork the DPA is applied both to the virtual and real corrections using a semi-analytical\napproach. Moreover, also the phase space is treated in DPA. The proposed DPA for\nthe bremsstrahlung process is based on the distinction between hard, semi-soft, and soft\nphotons, without a common treatment of photons of these domains for all observables. A\nrealistic photon recombination for collinear photon emission is not considered there. For\ninstance, the invariant masses of the W bosons are reconstructed from the momenta of the\ncorresponding decay fermions alone, without recombining soft and collinear photons. The\nresulting large shifts in the peak position of the W line shape, namely \u221220 MeV, \u221239 MeV,\nand \u221277 MeV for \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc , and e+ \u03bde final states at a centre-of-mass (CM) energy of\n3\n\nA survey of state-of-the-art calculations for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 is also contained in Ref. [ 3].\n\n2\n\n\f184 GeV, respectively, result from mass-singular logarithms of the form \u03b1 ln(ml /MW ) and\nare due to the absence of collinear photons in the definition of the invariant masses.\nO(\u03b1) corrections for W-pair production in DPA have also been implemented in the\nMonte Carlo generator YFSWW3 [ 20, 21]. In Ref. [ 20] the O(\u03b1) corrections to on-shell\nW-pair production have been combined with the exponentiation of photonic corrections\nfrom the initial and intermediate (WW) states. In Ref. [ 21], the final-state corrections\nhave been added in the leading-logarithmic approximation. The normalization of the\nW decays is fixed using the corrected branching ratios. The non-factorizable corrections\nare not fully included but only as an approximation in terms of the screened Coulomb\nansatz [ 22]. The spin correlations between the two W decays have been neglected in the\ncontributions of the non-leading corrections. In Ref. [ 21] the results of Ref. [ 19] have\nbeen confirmed qualitatively. Moreover, it has been found that the shifts of the peaks in\nthe W-invariant-mass distributions are reduced by taking into account collinear photons\nin the definition of the invariant masses, which effectively replaces the mass-singular\nlogarithms by logarithms of a minimum opening angle for collinear photon emission.\nAnother approximate version of the DPA was presented in Ref. [ 23] and discussed\nfor a purely hadronic final state. Both virtual and real corrections were treated within\nDPA, but non-factorizable corrections were neglected. The main emphasis was put on\nlinear-collider energies, in particular on the comparison to a high-energy approximation [\n24] for the one-loop correction.\nIn this paper we present the first complete calculation of the O(\u03b1) corrections for\noff-shell W-pair production in the DPA that has been implemented in a Monte Carlo\ngenerator. Numerical results of this generator, which is called RacoonWW, have already\nbeen presented in Refs. [ 25, 3] and [ 26] for LEP2 and linear-collider energies, respectively.\nThe lowest-order cross section is calculated including the complete diagrams for any fourfermion final state or in the CC03 approximation, i.e. including only the doubly-resonant\nW-pair production diagrams. The complete virtual corrections to W-pair production and\nW decay and the virtual non-factorizable corrections are included in the DPA. As far as\nthe real corrections are concerned, the matrix elements for the minimal gauge-invariant\nsubset of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 including the doubly-resonant contributions corresponding to Wpair production (the CC11 subset) are included. The real corrections and the virtual\ncorrections are matched in such a way that soft and collinear singularities cancel as far as\nthey should. The treatment of these singularities has been implemented in two different\nways, one of which uses the subtraction method described in Refs. [ 27, 17], the other one\nuses phase-space slicing. We use the exact four-fermion phase space throughout. Finally,\nwe note that all parts of the calculations have been performed in two independent ways.\nThe paper is outlined as follows: in Section 2 we describe the general strategy of\nour calculation. In Section 3 details on the virtual factorizable and non-factorizable corrections in DPA are given. In Section 4 we explain the matching of soft and collinear\nsingularities between virtual and real corrections, both for the subtraction method and\nfor phase-space slicing. The inclusion of higher-order initial-state radiation is described\nin Section 5, and Section 6 contains a discussion of QCD corrections. Numerical results\nare presented in Section 7, including predictions for the W-pair production cross section,\nangular and W invariant-mass distributions at LEP2, a detailed discussion of the intrinsic ambiguities of the proposed DPA, and comparisons to results of other authors. Our\n3\n\n\fconclusions are presented in Section 8, and the appendices provide some useful explicit\nresults.\n2\n\nStrategy of the calculation\nWe consider the process\ne+ (p+ , \u03c3+ ) + e\u2212 (p\u2212 , \u03c3\u2212 ) \u2192 W+ (k+ , \u03bb+ ) + W\u2212 (k\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 )\n\u2192 f1 (k1 , \u03c31 ) + f \u03042 (k2 , \u03c32 ) + f3 (k3 , \u03c33 ) + f \u03044 (k4 , \u03c34 ). (2.1)\n\nThe arguments label the momenta p\u00b1 , ki and helicities \u03c3i = \u00b11/2, \u03bbj = 0, \u00b11 of the\ncorresponding particles. We often use only the signs to denote the helicities. The fermion\nmasses are neglected whenever possible. As a consequence, the helicities of the incoming\nelectrons and positrons are related as \u03c3 = \u03c3\u2212 = \u2212\u03c3+ (in the absence of collinear photon\nemission). For the W-pair-mediated diagrams, and more generally for the graphs of the\nCC11 class, the helicities of the outgoing fermions are fixed, \u03c31,3 = \u2212\u03c32,4 = \u22121/2, owing\nto the left-handed coupling of the W bosons. In general this does not hold for other\nbackground diagrams.\nThe lowest-order cross section is calculated using the complete lowest-order matrix\n+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nof Ref. [ 28].\nelements MeBorn\nThe radiative corrections to (2.1) consist of virtual corrections, resulting from loop\ndiagrams, as well as of real corrections, originating from the process\ne+ (p+ , \u03c3+ ) + e\u2212 (p\u2212 , \u03c3\u2212 ) \u2192 W+ (k+ , \u03bb+ ) + W\u2212 (k\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) ( + \u03b3)\n\u2192 f1 (k1 , \u03c31 ) + f \u03042 (k2 , \u03c32 ) + f3 (k3 , \u03c33 ) + f \u03044 (k4 , \u03c34 ) + \u03b3(k, \u03bb\u03b3 ).\n(2.2)\nBoth have to be combined properly in order to ensure necessary cancellations of soft and\ncollinear singularities.\n2.1\n\nVirtual corrections\n\nWe treat the non-leading virtual corrections in double-pole approximation (DPA), i.e.\nwe take only those terms into account that are enhanced by two resonant W propagators\n(doubly-resonant corrections).\n2.1.1 Virtual factorizable corrections\nIn the DPA, there are two types of contributions, the factorizable and the nonfactorizable ones. The former are the ones that can be associated to one of the production or decay subprocesses, the latter are the ones that connect these subprocesses.\nThis splitting cannot be completely done on the basis of Feynman diagrams; otherwise\nthe splitting would not be gauge-invariant. To define this splitting, we start by inspecting only those graphs that retain two resonant W propagators outside the loops, i.e. all\ndiagrams of the generic structure shown in Figure 1. Since the loop corrections in such\ngraphs can be associated either to the production of the W-boson pair or to the decay of\n4\n\n\fe+\n\nf1\nW\nW\n\nf \u03042\nf3\n\nW\nW\n\nf \u03044\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\nOn-shell production\n\nOn-shell decays\n\nFigure 1: Diagrammatic structure of virtual factorizable corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f\none of the W bosons, this subset of graphs can be associated with the virtual factorizable\ncorrections. The corresponding amplitude is of the form\nM=\n\n2\n2\nR(k+\n, k\u2212\n, \u03b8)\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(k+ \u2212 MW + iMW \u0393W )(k\u2212 \u2212 MW\n+ iMW \u0393W )\n\n(2.3)\n\n2\nwhere k\u00b1\nare the invariant masses of the virtual W bosons, \u03b8 represents all other kinematical variables, MW is the renormalized W-boson mass, for which we take the on-shell\nmass, and \u0393W is the width of the W boson.\nThe diagrams of Figure 1 do not form a gauge-invariant subset. However, in DPA\na gauge-invariant contribution can be extracted by replacing the numerator with the\ngauge-invariant residue [ 29],\n+ \u2212\n\ne \u2192WW\u21924f\nMeDPA\n=\n\n2\n2\nR(MW\n, MW\n, \u03b8)\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(k+ \u2212 MW + iMW \u0393W )(k\u2212 \u2212 MW\n+ iMW \u0393W )\n\n(2.4)\n\n2\nIn principle, the amplitude should be expanded about the complex poles in k\u00b1\n. Replacing\n2\nthe complex pole position by MW \u2212 iMW \u0393W with on-shell mass and width introduces\nan error of O(\u03b12 ) (see App. D of Ref. [ 30]). The neglect of the width in the numerator\nintroduces an error of order \u0393W /MW . Since we apply the DPA only to the corrections, this\nleads to an error of O(\u03b1\u0393W /MW ) which is the order of the uncertainty of our calculation.\nNote that additional infrared (IR) singularities appear in the factorizable corrections when\ntaking the on-shell limit in the numerator.\nIn lowest order, the matrix element in DPA factorizes into the one for the production\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192W+ W\u2212\nof the two on-shell W bosons, MBorn\n, the (transverse parts of the) propagators of\n+ \u2192f f \u0304\n1 2\nthese bosons, and the matrix elements for the decays of these on-shell bosons, MW\nBorn\n\u2212\n \u0304\nW \u2192f3 f4\nand MBorn\n:\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192WW\u21924f\nMBorn,DPA\n\n=\n\nX\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u2192W\nMBorn\n\n\u03bb+ ,\u03bb\u2212\n\n+ W\u2212\n\n+\n\n \u0304\n\n\u2212\n\n \u0304\n\n\u2192f1 f2\nW \u2192f3 f4\nMW\nMBorn\nBorn\n,\nK + K\u2212\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere we introduced the abbreviations\n2\nK\u00b1 = k \u00b1\n\u2212 M 2,\n\n2\nM 2 = MW\n\u2212 iMW \u0393W\n\n5\n\n(2.6)\n\n\ffor the off-shellness of the W bosons.

Note that the polarizations have to be\ndefined in the same way for the production and the decay matrix elements.\nThe definition of the DPA for factorizable diagrams (2.4) implies that the squared\nmomenta of the W-boson legs of the production and decay vertex functions, which are\n2\n.\nhidden in the shaded blobs of Figure 1, have to be set to their on-shell values MW\n2\nThe W self-energies, marked by open blobs, have to be expanded about MW\n, and the\ncorresponding residues have to be distributed equally to the production and decay parts.\nFinally, we can express the factorizable doubly-resonant corrections by the product of\ngauge-independent on-shell matrix elements for W-pair production and W decays, and\nthe (transverse parts of the) W propagators,\n+ \u2212\n\ne \u2192WW\u21924f\n\u03b4Mevirt,fact,DPA\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bb+ ,\u03bb\u2212\n\n+ \u2192f f \u0304\n1 \u0010\n+ \u2212\n+\n\u2212\nW\u2212 \u2192f3 f \u03044\n1 2\n\u03b4Me e \u2192W W MW\nMBorn\nBorn\nK+ K\u2212\n\n \u0304\n\n+ \u2212\n\n+ W\u2212\n\n\u03b4MW\n\n+ \u2212\n\n+ W\u2212\n\n\u2192f1 f2\nMW\n\u03b4MW\nBorn\n\ne e \u2192W\n+ MBorn\ne e \u2192W\n+ MBorn\n\nwhere \u03b4M denote one-loop contributions.\n+ e\u2212 \u2192WW\u21924f\nMevirt,fact,DPA\ncan be found in Section 3.1.\n\n+\n\n+ \u2192f\n\n1 f2\n\n \u0304\n\n\u2212\n\n \u0304\n\nW \u2192f3 f4\nMBorn\n\u2212 \u2192f\n\n \u0304\n\n3 f4\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(2.7)\n\nDetails on the actual calculation of\n\n2.1.2 Virtual non-factorizable corrections\nAll loop diagrams that are not of the generic form of Figure 1 belong to the virtual\nnon-factorizable corrections. Simple power counting [ 16] reveals that only diagrams with\nphoton exchange in the loop can give rise to doubly-resonant (virtual) non-factorizable\ncorrections. The considered set of diagrams is not gauge-invariant even in the DPA. Therefore, we have defined the non-factorizable doubly-resonant corrections by subtracting the\nfactorizable doubly-resonant corrections from the complete doubly-resonant corrections [\n16]. The so-defined non-factorizable corrections do not only receive contributions from\ndiagrams in which the photon links the production and decay subprocesses, i.e. manifestly\nnon-factorizable diagrams [graphs like (a), (b), (c) of Figure 2], but also from factorizable diagrams [graphs like (d), (e), (f), (g) of Figure 2]. The latter contributions arise\nby subtracting the factorizable contributions of those graphs, which contain the artificial\nIR singularities mentioned above, from the complete graphs in DPA, in which the IR\nsingularities are replaced by logarithms of the form ln K\u00b1 . A representative set of diagrams contributing to the non-factorizable corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f is shown in\nFigure 2.\nNote that the non-factorizable corrections do not contain a product of two independent W propagators and that these corrections involve logarithms of the form ln(K\u00b1 ),\nwhich have to be kept exactly. Therefore, it is not possible to define a residue similar\n2\n2\n, \u03b8) for the double resonance as done for the factorizable corrections. The\n, MW\nto R(MW\nresonance structure of the non-factorizable corrections has the form of a homogeneous\npolynomial of order two in K+ and K\u2212 in the denominator.\nvirt\nThe non-factorizable corrections yield a simple correction factor \u03b4nfact,DPA\nto the lowestorder cross section.

In our formulas, we leave the form of the on-shell projection\nopen and mark all momenta of the associated on-shell point by carets. In particular, the\non-shell projections of the momenta k+ = k1 + k2 and k\u2212 = k3 + k4 of the W bosons obey\nk\u0302+ = k\u03021 + k\u03022 ,\n\nk\u0302\u2212 = k\u03023 + k\u03024 ,\n\n2\n2\nk\u0302\u00b1\n= MW\n.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe actual form of this on-shell projection is not uniquely determined, but involves some\nfreedom. However, this intrinsic ambiguity leads to differences of the order of \u03b1\u0393W /(\u03c0MW )\nfor different versions of the projection, i.e. the ambiguity remains below the desired level\nof accuracy for the DPA. The explicit on-shell projection used in the numerics is given in\nApp. A. For the on-shell kinematics we define the Mandelstam variables s and t\u0302 as usual,\ns = (p+ + p\u2212 )2 = (k\u0302+ + k\u0302\u2212 )2 ,\n\ns\n2\nt\u0302 = (p+ \u2212 k\u0302+ )2 = (p\u2212 \u2212 k\u0302\u2212 )2 = MW\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8),\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nq\n\n2\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 4MW\n/s and \u03b8 are the velocity and the scattering angle of the outgoing\nW bosons, respectively.\n\n2.2\n\nReal photonic corrections\n\nA substantial part of the O(\u03b1) corrections to four-fermion production is due to real\nphoton emission. Since detectors are not able to detect photons that are soft or collinear\nto fermions (other than muons), we have events with visible and invisible photons. The\nformer are events in which a photon of finite energy is separated from all other particles in\nthe detector, the latter correspond to events in which no separate photon is seen. Events\nwith visible photons can be taken into account via the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3, for invisible\nphotons a careful treatment of soft and collinear singularities is required in addition.\n2.2.1 The bremsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3\nFor the bremsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 the complete lowest-order matrix ele+ \u2212\nments Me e \u21924f \u03b3 are taken into account. More precisely, we employ the matrix elements\nfor the 4f + \u03b3 final states of the CC11 class, which is the minimal gauge-invariant subset\nof graphs containing all doubly-resonant diagrams corresponding to W-pair production.\nWe use the explicit results presented in Ref. [ 28].\n2.2.2 Invisible photons\nThe emission of invisible photons contributes to the O(\u03b1) corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f .\nThey include soft and collinear singularities, which are regularized by an infinitesimal\nphoton mass \u03bb and small fermion masses mf , respectively. Since the singularities of real\nand virtual corrections are related to each other, these corrections have to be combined\ncarefully, in order to avoid a mismatch in the singularity structure. We use two different\n8\n\n\fprocedures of treating soft and collinear photon emission: one is based on a subtraction\nmethod, the other on phase-space slicing. The precise implementation of these procedures\nis discussed in Section 4.\n2.3\n\nThe master formula\nThe total cross section is composed of the following contributions\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 =\n\nZ\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nd\u03c3Born\n\n+\n\nZ\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nd\u03c3virt\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n+ e\u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\n\nd\u03c3 e\n\n.\n\n(2.10)\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\nHere d\u03c3Born\nis the full lowest-order cross section to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f ,\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\n=\nd\u03c3Born\n\n+ e\u2212 \u21924f\n1\n|2\nd\u03a64f |MeBorn\n2s\n\n(2.11)\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne \u21924f\nwith the corresponding matrix element MeBorn\nand the four-particle phase-space ele+ \u2212\nment d\u03a64f .

In RacoonWW, we\nhave implemented two possibilities to extract the singularities from the real corrections,\none is based on a subtraction method and discussed in Section 4.1, the other is based\non the phase-space-slicing method and described in Section 4.2. Both procedures are\nequivalent. For the extraction of the singularities from the virtual corrections, also two\nchoices have been implemented. One is motivated by the subtraction method, the other is\ninspired by the definition of a U(1)-gauge-invariant virtual photon part following Ref. [ 31]\n(cf. Section 4.3). Since the definition of a finite part of the virtual corrections differs by\nfinite terms between both cases, and since the singular parts are treated exactly but\nthe finite parts in DPA, both approaches differ by terms of the order of the intrinsic\nuncertainty of the DPA. These differences are due to finite terms that are either taken\ninto account in DPA or exactly.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nVirtual corrections in double-pole approximation\nFactorizable corrections\n\nWe have calculated the contribution of the virtual corrections to the transition matrix\n+ e\u2212 \u2192WW\u21924f\nelements in DPA, \u03b4Mevirt,fact,DPA\n, in two different ways, the results of which are in\nperfect numerical agreement. In a first approach we made use of the results of Refs. [ 10]\nand [ 13] for the pair production and decay of on-shell W bosons, respectively. The\nvirtual corrections in DPA are given by (2.7) in this approach. When using the existing\non-shell results, particular care is needed concerning the polarization of the intermediate\nW bosons. In Refs. [ 10, 13] the polarization vectors for the W bosons were introduced\nin a way convenient for each process. In order to keep the spin correlation between\nproduction and decay subprocesses, it is, however, necessary to take one and the same\npolarization vectors for the production and the decay of a W boson and to perform the\nsummation over the W polarizations coherently, i.e. at the level of the unsquared matrix\nelement. Hence, the results for on-shell W bosons cannot be taken as black boxes, but\nhave to be carefully combined.\nIn a second approach we have performed a completely new and independent calculation of all relevant one-loop diagrams for the pair production and the decay of on-shell\nW bosons. The Feynman graphs have been generated with FeynArts [ 32]. The actual\ncalculation has been done twice using our own Mathematica [ 33] routines, once in the\n't Hooft\u2013Feynman gauge using the Feynman rules and the renormalization scheme of\nRef. [ 34] and once in the background-field formalism using the results of Ref. [ 35]. The\n10\n\n\fevaluation of the one-loop diagrams follows the methods described in Ref.

In the following we\nbriefly sketch the strategy of these calculations which exploits the factorization property\nof the amplitudes.\n3.1.1 Structure of the matrix elements\nThe DPA matrix elements are decomposed into a set of so-called standard matrix\nelements (SMEs) M\u03c3n , which contain the spin structure of the external particles, and\ninvariant coefficients Fn\u03c3 . Since the relevant diagrams factorize into W-pair production\nand W decay, the SMEs for W-pair production can be chosen as (\u03c3 = \u00b1)\nM\u03c31 = v\u0304(p+ )/\u03b5\u2217+ (/\u0302\nk + \u2212 /p+ )/\u03b5\u2217\u2212 \u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 ),\n\nM\u03c32 = v\u0304(p+ ) 21 (/\u0302\nk + \u2212 k/\u0302 \u2212 )\u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217+ \u03b5\u2217\u2212 ),\n\nM\u03c33 = v\u0304(p+ )/\u03b5\u2217+ \u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 k\u0302+ ) \u2212 v\u0304(p+ )/\u03b5\u2217\u2212 \u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217+ k\u0302\u2212 ),\nM\u03c34 = v\u0304(p+ )/\u03b5\u2217+ \u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 p\u2212 ) \u2212 v\u0304(p+ )/\u03b5\u2217\u2212 \u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217+ p+ ),\nk + \u2212 k/\u0302 \u2212 )\u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217+ k\u0302\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 k\u0302+ ),\nM\u03c35 = v\u0304(p+ ) 21 (/\u0302\n\nM\u03c36 = v\u0304(p+ ) 12 (/\u0302\nk + \u2212 k/\u0302 \u2212 )\u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217+ p+ )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 p\u2212 ),\nh\n\nk + \u2212 k/\u0302 \u2212 )\u03c9\u03c3 u(p\u2212 ) (\u03b5\u2217+ k\u0302\u2212 )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 p\u2212 ) + (\u03b5\u2217+ p+ )(\u03b5\u2217\u2212 k\u0302+ )\nM\u03c37 = v\u0304(p+ ) 12 (/\u0302\n\nwith \"effective W-polarization vectors\"\ne\n2sw\ne\n= \u221a\n2sw\n\n\u03b5\u2217,\u03bc\n+ = \u221a\n\u03b5\u2217,\u03bc\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u016b(k\u03021 )\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c9\u2212 v(k\u03022 ),\nK+\n1\n\u016b(k\u03023 )\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c9\u2212 v(k\u03024 ).\nK\u2212\n\ni\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe 14 SMEs given in (3.1) are exactly those defined in Ref. [ 34], where v\u0304(p+ ) and u(p\u2212 )\nare the Dirac spinors of the massless e+ e\u2212 initial state. The chirality projectors are given\nby \u03c9\u00b1 = 21 (1 \u00b1 \u03b35 ). The effective W-polarization vectors of (3.2) are a formal shorthand\nfor the W propagators and the tree-level decay matrix elements. Of course, the offshellness of the W bosons has to be kept in these W propagators, where k+ = k1 + k2 and\nk\u2212 = k3 + k4 are inserted, but the W decays are calculated with the on-shell kinematics,\ni.e. the Dirac spinors \u016b(k\u0302i ) and v(k\u0302i ) depend on the on-shell-projected momenta. Owing\nto the consistent neglect of fermion masses, the polarization vectors are transverse,\nk\u0302\u00b1 \u03b5\u2217\u00b1 = 0.\n\n(3.3)\n\n2\n2\nThis transversality and k\u0302\u00b1\n= MW\nensure that the algebraic reduction of the O(\u03b1) corrections to the W-pair production subprocess to SMEs and invariant coefficients can be\nperformed in the same way as for pure on-shell pair production, i.e. without knowing any\ndetails of the W decays.

The explicit expressions of the SMEs are listed in App. B.\nA few remarks on the choice of SMEs are appropriate. The choice (3.1) with (3.2) is\nobtained by taking all products of SMEs for the subprocesses e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 , W+ \u2192\nf1 f \u03042 , and W\u2212 \u2192 f3 f \u03044 for massless fermions (cf. (5.11) and (5.14) of Ref. [ 34]), and by\nsubsequently replacing \u03b5\u2217\u00b1,\u03bc\u03b5\u00b1,\u03bd by the W propagators. Owing to the purely left-handed\ncoupling of the W boson and the use of massless fermions, there is only one SME for\neach decay subprocess. Moreover, we have included the lowest-order coupling factor for\nthe decays so that the invariant functions Fn\u03c3 for the lowest-order amplitudes and the\nloop corrections for the production process are normalized in the same way as for on\u03c3\n(s, t\u0302) of the\nshell W-pair production. In particular, the non-vanishing coefficients Fn,Born\nlowest-order diagrams (see Figure 3) in DPA are given by\n\u2212\nF1,Born\n(s, t\u0302) =\n\ne2\n,\n2s2w t\u0302\n\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nF3,Born\n(s, t\u0302) = \u2212F2,Born\n(s, t\u0302) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\u2212\n2e2\n2e2\n1\u2212 2 .\n\u2212\n2\ns\ns \u2212 MZ\n2sw\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe chosen set of 14 SMEs is not minimal; more precisely, only 12 SMEs are independent.\nThe reduction to independent SMEs can be performed by making use of two relations\nbetween several SMEs that follow from the four-dimensionality of space time (cf. (11.8)\nof Ref. [ 34]).\nThe contributions of the virtual corrections to the W-pair production subprocess to\nthe invariant coefficients Fn\u03c3 can be directly read of from the results of Ref. [ 10]. The\ncontributions of the W decays are obtained by multiplying the corrections to the decay\nmatrix elements, which can be extracted for instance from Ref. [ 13], with the lowest-order\n\u03c3\ncoefficients Fn,Born\n(s, t\u0302) of (3.5). Note that care has to be taken that the relevant phases\nare taken into account properly.\n3.1.2 Evaluation of coefficient functions\nFinally, we add some remarks on the actual numerical evaluation of the invariant\ncoefficients Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302). The expressions for the one-loop contributions to these coefficients\nare rather involved (see Refs. [ 10, 11]) so that the corresponding computer codes are\nlengthy and slow. Moreover, the employed Passarino\u2013Veltman reduction [ 36] of tensor\nintegrals to scalar integrals breaks down at the boundary of phase space (cos \u03b8 = \u00b11),\n12\n\n\fnecessarily leading to numerical instabilities in the very forward and backward directions\nof the W-production angle \u03b8. In order to solve these problems of CPU time and numerical\ninstabilities, we have made use of the fact that all invariant coefficients Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302) depend\nonly on \u03b8 for a fixed scattering energy and fixed input parameters, such as masses and\ncouplings. Before starting the multi-dimensional Monte Carlo integration over the fourparticle phase space, we calculate a set of generalized Fourier coefficients\nZ\n2l + 1 +1\n\u03c3\ncn,l (s) =\nd cos \u03b8 t\u0302 Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302)Pl (cos \u03b8)\n(3.6)\n2\n\u22121\nby performing the integrals with the Legendre polynomials\ni\n1 dl h 2\nl\n,\nl = 0, 1, . . . ,\n(3.7)\n(x\n\u2212\n1)\n2l l! dxl\nnumerically. Using, for instance, Gaussian integration for these integrations yields sufficiently precise results without the need to enter the region of numerical instabilities in the\ncoefficients Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302). During the Monte Carlo integration, the coefficients are numerically\nreconstructed by making use of the generalized Fourier series\n\nPl (x) =\n\nFn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\n1 \u03c3\ncn,l (s)Pl (cos \u03b8),\nt\u0302\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich involves only trivial algebra. Thus, its evaluation is extremely fast. In practice,\nrelatively few generalized Fourier coefficients c\u03c3n,l (s) are needed; for example, taking l =\n0, . . . , 20 reproduces the full calculation of Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302) within roughly six digits for moderate\nscattering angles and LEP2 energies. Note also that the generalized Fourier series remains\nstable in the forward and backward directions where the original evaluation of Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302)\nbreaks down. The explicit factor t\u0302 in (3.6) and (3.8) was included in order to account for\na t-channel pole in some of the Fn\u03c3 (s, t\u0302); without this factor the expansion is less efficient\nand requires much more terms in the sum over l in (3.8).\n3.2\n\nNon-factorizable corrections\n\nIn Refs. [ 14, 15, 37, 16] the non-factorizable corrections have been discussed in detail.\nIn these references, however, the virtual non-factorizable corrections have been combined\nwith their counterparts involving real photon emission, in order to obtain an IR-safe\ncorrection that can be discussed separately. In our present approach we do not separate\nthe non-factorizable parts from the full real corrections so that we need the virtual nonfactorizable corrections separately. Here also those graphs must be taken into account\nthat are cancelled by their real counterparts [graphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of Figure 2]\nin the approach of Refs. [ 14, 15, 37, 16]. The complete expression for the virtual nonfactorizable corrections is given below4 , closely following the notation and conventions of\nRef. [ 16].\nThe virtual non-factorizable corrections can be written in terms of a correction factor\nvirt\nvirt\n\u03b4nfact,DPA to the lowest-order cross section. Analogously to Ref. [ 16], \u03b4nfact,DPA\nis decomposed into contributions that are associated with a pair of final-state fermions,\nX X\n\u03b1\nvirt\n(3.9)\n\u03b4nfact,DPA\n=\n(\u22121)a+b+1 Qa Qb Re{\u2206virt (p+ , p\u2212 ; k+ , ka ; k\u2212 , kb )},\n\u03c0\na=1,2 b=3,4\n4\n\nThe complete expression for the virtual non-factorizable corrections can also be found in Ref.

Finally, we note that in \u03b4nfact,DPA\nall fermion-mass singularities of the initial- and final-state fermions drop out, although some non-factorizable\ngraphs contain such fermion-mass singularities.\n4\n\nTreatment of soft and collinear photon emission\n\nIn the following we describe two procedures of treating soft and collinear photon\nemission: one is based on a subtraction method, the other on phase-space slicing. In both\ncases soft and collinear singularities are regularized by an infinitesimal photon mass and\nsmall fermion masses, respectively.\nFor convenience, we introduce a second, generic notation for the momenta and helicities\nof the external particles:\ne+ (q1 , \u03ba1 ) + e\u2212 (q2 , \u03ba2 ) \u2192 f1 (q3 , \u03ba3 ) + f \u03042 (q4 , \u03ba4 ) + f3 (q5 , \u03ba5 ) + f \u03044 (q6 , \u03ba6 ) ( + \u03b3(k, \u03bb\u03b3 ))\n(4.1)\nin addition to (2.1) and (2.2). Moreover, the masses of the external fermions are denoted\nby mi (qi2 = m2i \u2192 0), and we use the invariants sij = 2qi qj in the following.\n15\n\n\f4.1\n\nThe dipole subtraction approach\n\nThe idea of so-called subtraction methods is to subtract a simple auxiliary function\nfrom the singular integrand of the bremsstrahlung integral and to add this contribution\nback again after partial analytic integration. This auxiliary function has to be chosen in\nsuch a way that it cancels all singularities of the original integrand so that the phasespace integration of the difference can be performed numerically, even over the singular\n+ \u2212\nregions of the original integrand, which is |Me e \u21924f \u03b3 |2 in our case. In this difference\n+ \u2212\nMe e \u21924f \u03b3 can be evaluated without regulators for soft or collinear singularities, i.e. we\n+ \u2212\ncan make use of the results of Ref. [ 28] for Me e \u21924f \u03b3 with massless fermions. The\nauxiliary function has to be simple enough so that it can be integrated over the singular\nregions analytically, when the subtracted contribution is added again. This part contains\nthe singular contributions and requires regulators, i.e. photon and fermion masses have to\nbe reintroduced there. In RacoonWW we have applied the dipole subtraction formalism,\nwhich is a process-independent approach that was first proposed [ 38] within QCD for\nmassless unpolarized partons and subsequently generalized to photon radiation of massive\npolarized fermions [ 27]. We only need the limit of small fermion masses [ 27, 17] in which\nthe application of the method is relatively simple. In order to keep the description of the\nmethod transparent, we describe only the basic structure of the individual terms in (2.16)\nexplicitly and refer to Refs. [ 27, 17]5 for the details.\nIn the dipole subtraction formalism the subtraction function is constructed from contributions that are labelled by ordered pairs ij of charged fermions, so-called \"dipoles\".\nThe fermions i and j are called emitter and spectator, respectively, since by construction\nonly the kinematics of the emitter i leads to collinear singularities. The auxiliary func+ \u2212\ntions |Msub,ij |2 that are subtracted from the original integrand |Me e \u21924f \u03b3 |2 are given\nby\n|Msub,ij (\u03a64f \u03b3 )|2 = \u2212(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj e2\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 =\u00b1\n\n(sub)\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\ngij,\u03c4 (qi , qj , k) |MBorn\n(\u03a6\u03034f,ij , \u03c4 \u03bai )|2 , (4.2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u03bai denotes the helicity of the emitter6 .

This mapping is chosen differently for different ij pairs, as\n+ e\u2212 \u21924f\n. The mappings have to ensure that the\nindicated by \u03a6\u03034f,ij in the argument of MeBorn\nkinematics in \u03a64f \u03b3 and \u03a6\u03034f,ij asymptotically approach each other in the soft limit,\n\nand in the collinear limits,\n\n5\n\nqi k\u21920\ng q\u0303i ,\n\nqi \u2212 k kqg\nq\u0303i ,\ni \u21920\nqi + k kqg\nq\u0303i ,\ni \u21920\n\nqj k\u21920\ng q\u0303j ,\n\nqj kqg\nq\u0303j ,\ni \u21920\nqj kqg\nq\u0303j ,\ni \u21920\n\n(4.3)\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(4.4)\n\ni = 3, . . . , 6,\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe subtraction functions of Ref.

We define \u0398(\u03a64f (\u03b3) ) = 1 if the event passes the separation cuts\nafter eventual photon recombination and \u0398(\u03a64f (\u03b3) ) = 0 otherwise. In contrast to the first\nterm, the observable in the second term depends on the 4f phase space, \u03a6\u03034f,ij , and is independent of the photon recombination procedure. The reason for the different arguments is\nthat the final-state mass singularities included in the subtraction functions have to match\nthe corresponding singularities of the virtual corrections exactly. On the other hand, the\ndifferent arguments of the terms require that all photons have to be combined with the\n17\n\n\fnearest charged fermion in the collinear limits in order to obtain \u0398(\u03a64f \u03b3 ) = \u0398(\u03a6\u03034f,ij ) in\nthe soft and collinear limits [see (4.3) and (4.4)].\nThe calculation of distributions is similar to the application of cuts, since a histogram\nof a distribution is nothing but a series of cuts. Hence, the histogram routine that generates the desired distribution during the Monte Carlo integration has to handle each\ncolumn of the histogram in the same way as a cutted contribution to the integrated cross\nsection. Note that in this procedure the original differential cross section and the subtraction functions may contribute to different columns of the histogram for one and the\nsame event. The final result for each column is nevertheless finite, because such events\nare in general far away from the singular regions7 .\nIn addition to the finite part of the real corrections, which is given in (4.11), we have\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\n. Therefore, we have to\nto determine the singular part of the real corrections, d\u03c3sing\nevaluate the phase-space integral of all contributions |Msub,ij |2 at least over the singular\nregions for finite mass regulators mi and \u03bb. To this end, we split the five-particle phase\nspace into the four-particle phase space and the remaining photonic parts:\nZ\n\nd\u03a64f \u03b3 =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6\u03034f,ij (x)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6\u03b3,ij .\n\n(4.12)\n\nIf i and/or j are initial-state particles, the momentum of one of these is reduced by a\nfactor x, i.e. q\u03031 = xq1 or q\u03032 = xq2 . This is indicated by the argument x in \u03a6\u03034f,ij (x). (For\nfinal-state emitter and spectator d\u03a6\u03b3,ij includes the function \u03b4(1 \u2212 x) which fixes x = 1.)\nThen, the singular part of the real corrections can be written as\nZ\n\n+ \u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\n\ne e\nd\u03c3sing\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n=\u2212\n\n6 X\n\u03b1 X\n(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj\n2\u03c0 i,j=1 \u03c4 =\u00b1\n\n(4.13)\n\ni6=j\n\n(sub)\n\nd\u03a6\u03034f,ij (x) Gij,\u03c4 (s\u0303ij , x)\n\n\u0010\n\u00112 \u0010\n\u0011\n+ e\u2212 \u21924f\n1\nMeBorn\n\u03a6\u03034f,ij (x), \u03c4 \u03bai \u0398 \u03a6\u03034f,ij (x) ,\n2xs\n\n(sub)\n\nwhere the functions Gij,\u03c4 originate from the photonic phase-space integral over the radi(sub)\nator functions gij,\u03c4 ,\n(sub)\nGij,\u03c4 (s\u0303ij , x)\n\n= 8\u03c0\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n(sub)\n\nd\u03a6\u03b3,ij x gij,\u03c4 (qi , qj , k),\n\n(4.14)\n\nand s\u0303ij = 2q\u0303i q\u0303j .

These singular terms are exactly the wellknown universal logarithms of the structure-function approach for leading-logarithmic\nISR.\n7\n\nAt the edges of the histogram columns this can also occur for \"singular events\". The finiteness of\nsuch contributions is guaranteed by the suppression of phase space for those events.\n\n18\n\n\fFor both emitter and spectator from the final state (i, j = 3, . . . , 6) the convolution\nover x in (4.13) is absent, so that the integrand depends on the 4f kinematics of the\noriginal CM system in this case. For the other cases, where at least the emitter or the\nspectator are from the initial state, the soft singularities appear at the endpoint x \u2192 1 in\nthe convolution over x.

The finite remainder can be evaluated by\nusing the usual Monte Carlo techniques. For the actual implementation of this wellknown procedure (see e.g. Ref. [ 39]) we closely follow the approaches of Refs. [ 40, 41].\nWe divide the five-particle phase space into soft and collinear regions by introducing the\ncut-off parameters \u03b4s and \u03b4c , respectively.

In the case of initial-state radiation, the fourparticle phase space is generated in the CM system of the hard scattering process after\nthe emission of the collinear photon, i.e. in the system with CM energy s\u0303 = x1,2 s, and the\n21\n\n\ffour-momenta are then Lorentz-boosted back to the laboratory frame. In the case of finalstate radiation the CM energy before and after collinear photon radiation are the same,\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nso that d\u03c3Born\ndoes not depend on zi . Thus, the integration over zi can be performed\nanalytically, as done in the last equation of (4.27). Note that this procedure implicitly\nassumes that photons within small cones collinear to charged final-state fermions will\nnever be separated from those collinear fermions.\nSubtracting the soft and collinear cross sections (4.24) and (4.25) from the cross section\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\nof the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 (4.21) yields the finite cross section d\u03c3finite\n. As usual in\nthe phase-space-slicing approach, this subtraction is done in practice\nby\nimposing\ncuts\n\u221a\non the 4f \u03b3 phase space, i.e. a photon-energy cut, E\u03b3 > \u2206E = \u03b4s s/2, and a cut on the\nangles between the photon and charged fermions, \u22121 < cos \u03b8\u03b3f < 1 \u2212 \u03b4c , but by using the\nexact matrix elements for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 of Ref. [ 28]. The collinear and soft cross sections\nare added,\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\nd\u03c3sing\n= d\u03c3soft + d\u03c3coll ,\n(4.28)\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\nof Section 4.3,\nand combined with the singular part of the virtual cross section d\u03c3virt,sing\nas described in Section 2.3.\nThe full radiative corrections are split into a 4f part with no or an invisible photon,\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192WW\u21924f\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f \u03b3\nd\u03c3virt,finite,DPA + d\u03c3virt+real,sing\n, and a 4f \u03b3 part with a visible photon, d\u03c3finite\n. Both\ncontributions depend on the cut-off parameters \u03b4s , \u03b4c . The dependence on these technical\ncuts cancels in the sum when the cut-off parameters are chosen to be small enough so\nthat the soft-photon and leading-pole approximations apply. In Figure 4 we display the\ncut-off dependence of the total cross sections to both parts separately and also illustrate\nthe cancellation of the cut-off dependence in their sum.\n\n4.3\n\nDefinition of finite virtual corrections\n\nNext, we turn to the extraction of the singular contributions from the virtual correce+ e\u2212 \u21924f\ntions, i.e. the definition of d\u03c3virt,sing\nin (2.12). Here we can make use of the well-known\ncancellation for soft and collinear singularities between real and virtual corrections (KLN\ntheorem [ 43]). For inclusive photons, the only uncancelled singularities are the collinear\nsingularities originating from the continuum part of initial-state radiation (xi 6= 1). In\nother words, the singularities of the virtual corrections are exactly given by the endpoint\nparts defined in Section 4.1 within the subtraction approach, but with opposite sign.\nTherefore, we can define the singular part of the virtual corrections by\n+ \u2212\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\ne e \u21924f\nd\u03c3virt,sing,sub\n= d\u03c3Born\n\n6\n6\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u03b1 X\n(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj L(sij , m2i ) + L(sij , m2j ) + Cij + Cji\n2\u03c0 i=1 j=i+1\n(4.29)\n\nwith L(sij , m2i ) and Cij defined in (4.19) and (4.20) of Section 4.1, respectively. Note that\nwe do not include the polarization-dependent contributions of the endpoint parts [the\nterms \u00b11/2 in (4.18)] in this definition. Since the polarization-dependent terms are nonsingular, the simple formulae of this section hold also for the polarized case. Subtracting\n(4.29) from the virtual corrections yields the finite virtual cross section in the subtractionmethod-inspired approach. We note that it is gauge-invariant by construction, since only\nthe Born cross section enters without modification.\n22\n\n\f\u001b [fb]\n\n\u001b [fb]\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n\n4f\n4f\n4f + 4f\n29fb\n\n4:3\n\n3:9\n\n3:5\nlog10\n\n3:1\n\n2:7\n\n2:3\n\n4f\n4f\n4f + 4f\n29fb\n\n5\n\n4:6\n\n4:2\n\n\u000es\n\n3:8\n\nlog 10\n\n3:4\n\n3\n\n\u000e\u0012\n\nFigure 4: Cut-off dependence\nof the total cross section in the phase-space-slicing approach\n\u221a\nfor e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV. The 4f part (without Born), the 4f \u03b3 part, and\ntheir sum are shown as a function of log10 \u03b4s (l.h.s.) (with \u03b4c = 0.0005) and log10 \u03b4c (r.h.s.)\n(with \u03b4s = 0.001).\nThe definition of the virtual singular cross section is a matter of convention as far as\nfinite contributions are concerned, since finite terms can be redistributed between singular\nand finite parts. Another possibility is to define a finite virtual photon contribution\nby following the approach of Ref. [ 31]. In this YFS-inspired approach, the IR-singular\ncontributions are extracted with the help of an explicitly U(1)-gauge-invariant current as\nfollows,\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\n\nd\u03c3soft,YFS = d\u03c3Born\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\nRe (\u2212i4\u03c0\u03b1)\n\"\n\n\uf8f3\n\n6\n6\nX\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj\n\ni=1 j=i+1\n\nd4 k\n(k + 2\u03b8j qj )\u03bc\n(k \u2212 2\u03b8i qi )\u03bc\n\u2212\n(2\u03c0)4 k 2 \u2212 2\u03b8i qi k + i\u01eb k 2 + 2\u03b8j qj k + i\u01eb\n\ne e \u21924f\n= d\u03c3Born\n\n\"\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n6\n6\nX\n\u03b1 X\n(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj\n2\u03c0 i=1 j=i+1\n\nL(sij , m2i )\n\n+\n\nL(sij , m2j )\n\nsij\n+ 2 ln\nmi mj\n\n!\n\n#2\n\n\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\n1\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 + i\u01eb \uf8fe\n\n(4.30)\n#\n\n\u03c02\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u03b8(\u03b8i \u03b8j ) \u03c0 2 + 2 ,\n3\n\nwhere \u03b8i = +1(\u22121) if i is a final-state (initial-state) fermion. Again we keep the fermion\nmasses only as regulators for the collinear singularities. As can easily be seen from (4.30),\nthe U(1) gauge invariance is guaranteed by the existence of a conserved current. This\nYFS factor takes care only of the IR-singular logarithms and the double-logarithmic mass\n\n23\n\n\fsingularities. Since the single-logarithmic mass-singular terms build a separately gaugeinvariant subset we can simply add them to the YFS factor as follows [ 44],\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nd\u03c3virt,sing,YFS\n\n=\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nd\u03c3soft,YFS\n\n\u2212\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nd\u03c3Born\n\n6\n6\nX\nsij\n\u03b1X\n(\u22121)i+j Qi Qj ln\n\u03c0 i=1 j=i+1\nmi mj\n\n!\n\n.

A numerical discussion of this ambiguity for observables can\nbe found in Section 7.3.\nWhile the two different definitions of the virtual singular corrections are inspired by the\nsubtraction method and the YFS treatment of IR singularities, their use is independent\nof the method employed for the treatment of singularities in the bremsstrahlung contribution. This means that for the splitting between singular and finite virtual corrections\ne+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nboth definitions d\u03c3virt,sing,(sub,YFS)\ncan be used in the subtraction and phase-space-slicing\napproaches.\n5\n\nHigher-order initial-state radiation\n\nThe emission of photons collinear to the incoming electrons or positrons leads to\ncorrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. In order to achieve an accuracy at the\nfew 0.1% level, the corresponding higher-order contributions, i.e. contributions beyond\nO(\u03b1), must be taken into account. This can be done in the structure-function method [\n45, 7]. According to the mass-factorization theorem, the leading-logarithmic (LL) initialstate QED corrections can be written as a convolution of the lowest-order cross section\nwith structure functions, and the corresponding differential cross section reads\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 LL =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndx1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nLL\n2\ndx2 \u0393LL\nee (x1 , Q )\u0393ee (x2 , Q )\n\n24\n\nZ\n\n+ \u2212\n\ne e \u21924f\n(x1 p+ , x2 p\u2212 ).\nd\u03c3Born\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fHere x1 and x2 denote the fractions of the longitudinal momentum carried by the incoming electron and positron momenta just before the hard scattering process occurs.

On\nthe one hand, the hadronic W width receives a QCD correction, namely a factor (1+\u03b1s /\u03c0)\n[ 12, 13] in O(\u03b1s ). This affects the total W width \u0393W in the resonant W propagators. On\nthe other hand, each hadronically decaying W boson receives a QCD correction to the\nW q q\u0304 \u2032 vertex. If the full phase space for gluon emission is integrated over, this correction\nreduces to a multiplicative correction factor (1 + \u03b1s /\u03c0) for each hadronically decaying\nW boson in O(\u03b1s ). The application of this inclusive factor to distributions is usually\ncalled \"naive QCD correction\". In the total cross section these naive QCD factors cancel\nagainst the corresponding factors in the W width in the resonant W propagators. Note\nthat one-gluon exchange8 between quarks from different W bosons vanishes exactly for\npure charged-current (CC) reactions, because of the colour structure.\nIf the gluon phase space is not integrated over, QCD corrections have to be calculated\nfrom the virtual vertex corrections and from real gluon emission with the matrix elements\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f + g. This option is also supported by RacoonWW for four-fermion final\nstates of the CC11 class. The calculation is technically similar to the one for the photonic\ncorrections [ 28].\n7\n\nNumerical results\n\nFor the numerical results, with the exception of the comparison to the results of other\ngroups, we used (as in Refs.

Instead of \u03b1 we\nuse G\u03bc to parametrize the lowest-order matrix element, i.e. we use the effective coupling\n\u221a\n2 2\n2G\u03bc MW\nsw\n\u03b1G \u03bc =\n(7.2)\n\u03c0\nin the lowest-order matrix element. This parametrization has the advantage that all\nhigher-order contributions associated with the running of the electromagnetic coupling\n2\nfrom zero to MW\nand the leading universal two-loop mt -dependent corrections are already\nabsorbed in the Born cross section. In the relative O(\u03b1) corrections, on the other hand,\n8\n\nMultiple gluon exchange, which is intrinsically connected to colour reconnection, is not considered\nhere. It should be included in the hadronization simulation.\n\n26\n\n\fwe use \u03b1 = \u03b1(0), since in the real corrections and in the mass-singular virtual corrections,\nwhich yield the bulk of the remaining corrections, the scale of the real or virtual photon is\nzero. The W-boson width given above is calculated including the electroweak and QCD\none-loop corrections with \u03b1s = 0.119.\nAs default, we use the following set of separation and recombination cuts:\n1. All photons within a cone of 5 degrees around the beams are treated as invisible,\ni.e. their momenta are disregarded when calculating angles, energies, and invariant\nmasses.\n2. Next, the invariant masses Mf \u03b3 of the photon with each of the charged final-state\nfermions are calculated. If the smallest Mf \u03b3 is smaller than a certain cutoff Mrec\nor if the energy of the photon is smaller than 1 GeV, the photon is combined with\nthe charged final-state fermion that leads to the smallest Mf \u03b3 , i.e. the momenta of\nthe photon and the fermion are added and associated with the momentum of the\nfermion, and the photon is discarded9 .\n3. Finally, all events are discarded in which one of the charged final-state fermions is\nwithin a cone of 10 degrees around the beams. No other cuts are applied.\nIn Refs. [ 25, 26] we have already presented a short survey of numerical results for\nO(\u03b1) corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f obtained with RacoonWW for LEP2 and\nlinear-collider energies. In the meantime we extended RacoonWW by taking into account higher-order ISR and by considering QCD one-loop corrections as described in\nSection 5 and Section 6, respectively. Here we concentrate on LEP2 energies and provide\nresults for the total cross sections and distributions obtained with this extended version of\nRacoonWW. Additional numerical results can also be found in Ref. [ 3]. Unless stated\notherwise, for the lowest-order contributions only the CC03 diagrams are taken into account. Our \"best\" results comprise the CC03 Born cross sections and the corrected cross\nsections including all the radiative corrections described in this paper, i.e. electroweak\none-loop corrections in DPA, exact O(\u03b1) photon radiation based on the full matrix element for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3, higher-order ISR up to O(\u03b13 ) and \"naive\" QCD O(\u03b1s ) corrections\n(see Section 6).\nAs mentioned before, RacoonWW involves two branches for the treatment of soft\nand collinear singularities, one following the subtraction (see Section 4.1) and one the\nphase-space-slicing method (see Section 4.2). While these two branches use the same\nmatrix elements, the Monte Carlo integration is performed completely independently,\nthus providing us with a powerful numerical check of RacoonWW. In the following we\npresent numerical results of both branches of RacoonWW, starting with the total cross\nsections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f at LEP2 CM energies. If not stated otherwise, the finite\nvirtual corrections that are treated in DPA are defined by the subtraction-method-inspired\napproach (4.29).\n9\n\nExcept for the 1 GeV cut, the described cut and recombination procedure coincides with the one used\nin Refs.

Note that for CC03 and negligible fermion masses the results are\nindependent of the final state within these channels. In the calculation of these numbers\nno cuts have been applied. The only difference between the results shown in the two\ntables lies in the ISR beyond O(\u03b1): while Table 1 includes only the O(\u03b12 ) contributions\nof (5.2), Table 2 includes the O(\u03b13 ) contributions in addition. There are no significant\ndifferences between both tables, i.e. the effect of the O(\u03b13 ) contributions is smaller than\nthe integration error, which is at the level of 0.1%. The given errors are purely statistical.\nThe errors for the total cross sections were obtained by adding the (statistically correlated)\nerrors of the various channels linearly.\nFigure 5 shows a comparison of the results of RacoonWW as presented in Table 1\n(see also Ref. [ 3]) and of other Monte Carlo predictions with recent LEP2 data, as given\nby the LEP Electroweak Working Group [ 46] for the Winter 2000 conferences.\nThe data are in good agreement with the predictions of RacoonWW and YFSWW3\n[ 20, 21]. At the time of the conferences in Winter 2000 the predictions of YFSWW3\nwhere about 0.5\u20130.7% larger than those of RacoonWW, which is somewhat larger than\nthe intrinsic DPA ambiguity. Meanwhile, however, the main source of this discrepancy\nwas found, and the improved YFSWW3 results differ from the ones of RacoonWW\nonly by about 0.3% at LEP2 energies.

A brief summary is given in Section 7.4.2. Figure 5 also includes the prediction\nprovided by GENTLE [ 47], which is 2\u20132.5% larger than those from RacoonWW and\nYFSWW3. This difference is due to the neglect of non-leading, non-universal O(\u03b1)\ncorrections in GENTLE. The 1\u20132% reduction in the W-pair production cross section\nby these effects could already be seen from the results of Refs. [ 6, 7, 8], where such\ncorrections to on-shell W-pair production were considered. In summary, the comparison\nbetween predictions of the electroweak Standard Model and LEP2 data reveals empirical\nevidence of non-leading electroweak radiative corrections beyond the level of universal\neffects.\n7.2\n\nDistributions for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212\u03bd\u0304\u03bc at LEP2\n\nNow we turn to results obtained with the cut and recombination procedure described\nat the beginning of Section 7. We consider the cases of a tight recombination cut Mrec =\n5 GeV (\"bare\") and of a loose recombination cut Mrec = 25 GeV (\"calo\").\nIn Table 3 we provide the\n\u221a total cross sections for leptonic, semileptonic and hadronic\nprocesses at the CM energy s = 200 GeV with the bare cuts applied. The corrections are\n\u22129.1%, \u22125.8%, and \u22122.3% for the leptonic, semileptonic and hadronic channel, respectively. The results obtained when using the phase-space-slicing method agree well with\nthose of the subtraction method, i.e. within the statistical errors of about 0.05%. For calo\ncuts we find the same good agreement between both branches. The differences between\nthe cross sections for bare and calo cuts are below 0.05%; of course, the lowest-order\nresults are not affected by the recombination procedure.\nIn the following\u221awe show a variety of distributions for the semi-leptonic process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV at lowest order and when taking into account radiative\n30\n\n\fh\n\nd\u001b\nfb\ndMW+ GeV\n\ni\n\nd\u001b\ndMW\n\n200\n\n200\n\nBorn\nbest\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85\n\nMW+ [GeV]\n\nh\n\nfb\nGeV\n\ni\n\nBorn\nbest\n\n75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85\n\nMW [GeV]\n\n+\n\u2212\nFigure 6: Distributions in the\n\u221a W (l.h.s.) and W (r.h.s.) invariant masses for a calo\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\nsetup for e e \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV\n\ncorrections (\"best\"). We also display the relative corrections d\u03c3/d\u03c3Born \u2212 1 (in per cent)\nto illustrate the effect of the radiative corrections. For the relative corrections we always\nprovide the results of both branches of RacoonWW, one employing the subtraction and\none the phase-space-slicing method. Since we use the subtraction-method-inspired definition of the finite virtual corrections in both cases, and thus the same DPA definition,\nthe results should agree within integration errors.\nThe invariant-mass distributions for the W+ and W\u2212 bosons are shown in Figure 6\nfor the calo recombination cut. The relative corrections to the W+ and W\u2212 invariantmass distributions are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, for both recombination\ncuts. The invariant masses are obtained from the four-momenta of the decay fermions of\nthe W bosons after eventual recombination with the photon four-momentum. They are\nparticularly sensitive to the treatment of the photons, and thus a strong dependence of\nthe relative corrections on the recombination cut can be observed. A detailed discussion\nof the distortion of the invariant-mass distributions of the W bosons and their origin\nhas been given in Ref. [ 25]. The distributions obtained from the phase-space-slicing and\nsubtraction methods are compatible with each other. The integration errors are larger\nfurther away from the W resonance because of the decreasing statistics.\nIn Figures 9\u201311 on the l.h.s. we always show the distributions in lowest order and\nincluding the radiative corrections for the recombination cut Mrec = 25 GeV, and on the\nr.h.s. the corresponding relative corrections for both the subtraction and phase-spaceslicing methods.\nWe define all angles in the laboratory system, which is the CM system of the initial\nstate. The distributions in the cosine of the W+ production angle \u03b8W+ and of the decay angle \u03b8W+ d\u0304 , together with the corresponding relative corrections, are shown in Figures 9 and\n10, respectively. In both cases the corrections depend strongly on the angle.

The\nincrease of the integration errors for large decay angles is due to the smallness of the\ncorresponding cross section.\nFinally, we consider distributions in azimuthal angles. In Figure 11 we show the\ndistributions over the azimuthal decay angle \u03c6W+ of the W+ boson, i.e. the angle between\nthe decay plane of the W+ and the plane of W-pair production,\ncos \u03c6W+ =\n\n(k+ \u00d7 p+ )(k+ \u00d7 k1 )\n,\n|k+ \u00d7 p+ ||k+ \u00d7 k1 |\n\nsgn(sin \u03c6W+ ) = sgn {k+ * [(k+ \u00d7 p+ ) \u00d7 (k+ \u00d7 k1 )]} .\n(7.3)\n\nIn this distribution the corrections vary only weakly with the angle.\nThe distributions over the angle \u03c6 between the two planes spanned by the momenta\nof the two fermion pairs in which the W bosons decay, i.e. (note that k+ = \u2212k\u2212 for\nnon-photonic events)\ncos \u03c6 =\n\n(k+ \u00d7 k1 )(\u2212k\u2212 \u00d7 k3 )\n,\n|k+ \u00d7 k1 ||\u2212k\u2212 \u00d7 k3 |\n\nsgn(sin \u03c6) = sgn {k+ * [(k+ \u00d7 k1 ) \u00d7 (\u2212k\u2212 \u00d7 k3 )]} ,\n\n(7.4)\nare presented in Figure 12. The corrections are about \u22125% except for angles \u03c6 about\n0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6 , i.e. if the two decay planes coincide. This can be understood as follows:\nfor non-photonic events the angle \u03c6 is related to the azimuthal decay angles \u03c6W\u00b1 by\n\u03c6W+ \u00b1 \u03c6W\u2212 plus some constant (depending on the precise definition of \u03c6W\u2212 ). Since the\nvirtual corrections depend on \u03c6W\u00b1 only via sin \u03c6W\u00b1 and cos \u03c6W\u00b1 , which are rather smooth\nfunctions, the peaks for \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 180\u25e6 cannot originate from the virtual corrections.\nIf, however, a hard photon is emitted, the finite angle between k+ and \u2212k\u2212 leads to a\nfinite angle between the two decay planes except for the rare situation where k1 and k3\nare in the plane spanned by k+ and \u2212k\u2212 . Thus, for hard photonic events \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 and\n\u03c6 = 180\u25e6 are suppressed, and the large negative corrections at these angles are remnants\nof the virtual counterparts of the collinear singularities of the ISR, which are only partially\ncompensated by real photon emission.

As can be deduced from\nApp. A of Ref. [ 19], the contributions of the imaginary parts of the one-loop corrections\nalways involve a factor sin \u03c6W+ or a factor sin \u03c6W\u2212 together with symmetric functions\nin these angles. Consequently, they average to zero if the azimuthal angles of the decay\nfermions are integrated over. This is obviously the case for all quantities discussed so\nfar except for the \u03c6 and \u03c6W+ distributions. While we do not find significant effects of\nimaginary loop parts in the \u03c6 distribution, we find a small impact on the \u03c6W+ distribution.\nIn Figure 13 we compare the relative corrections to the \u03c6W+ distribution with (\"imag\")\nand without (\"def\") imaginary parts.\n\n34\n\n\fh\nfb i\nd\u001edW\u001b + deg\n\n\u001b\n1[%]\nd\u001bdBorn\n\n3\n\n0\n\nBorn\nbest\n\n2:5\n\nsubtraction\nslicing\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1:5\n6\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0:5\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u001eW+ [deg]\n\n250\n\n300\n\n10\n\n350\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u001eW+ [deg]\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nFigure 11: Distributions in the\u221aazimuthal W+ angle (l.h.s.) and the relative corrections\n(r.h.s.) for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV\n\nh\ni\nd\u001b fb\nd\u001e deg\n\nd\u001b\nd\u001bBorn\n\n3\n\n0\n\nBorn\nbest\n\n2:5\n\n1[%]\nsubtraction\nslicing\n\n2\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n8\n\n1:5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n12\n0:5\n0\n\n14\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u001e [deg]\n\n250\n\n300\n\n16\n\n350\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u001e[deg]\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nFigure 12: Distributions in the\n\u221a azimuthal \u03c6 angle (l.h.s.) and the relative corrections\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n(r.h.s.) for e e \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV\n\n35\n\n\f\u001b\n1[%]\nd\u001bdBorn\n\n0\n\ndef\nimag\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u001eW+ [deg]\n\nFigure 13: Relative corrections to the distribution in the azimuthal angle \u03c6W+ with\n(\"imag\")\nand without (\"def\") imaginary parts of the loop integrals for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n\u221a\nat s = 200 GeV\n7.3\n\nDiscussion of intrinsic ambiguities and of other options\n\nIn order to investigate the accuracy of the DPA quantitatively, we have modified the\nimplementation of the DPA and compared the obtained results. The differences should\nbe of the order of \u03b1\u0393W /MW . Recall that in RacoonWW only the finite (i.e. non-masssingular) virtual corrections are treated in DPA, while real photon emission is based on\nthe full e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 matrix element with the exact five-particle phase space. Thus,\nonly finite virtual corrections are affected by the following modifications. Specifically, we\nconsider four types of options:\n\u2022 Different on-shell projections:\nAs explained in Section 2.1.3, one has to specify a projection of the physical momenta to a set of momenta for on-shell W-pair production and decay10 , in order\nto define a DPA. This can be done in an obvious way by fixing the direction of\none of the W bosons and of one of the final-state fermions originating from either\nW boson in the CM frame of the incoming e+ e\u2212 pair. The default in RacoonWW,\nwhich is explicitly specified in App. A, is to fix the directions of the momenta of the\nfermions (not of the anti-fermions) resulting from the W+ and W\u2212 decays (\"def\").\nA different projection is obtained by fixing the direction of the anti-fermion from\nthe W+ decay (\"proj\") instead of the fermion direction.\n\u2022 Different definitions of finite virtual corrections:\nIn Section 4 the matching of soft and collinear singularities between virtual and\nreal corrections has been explained in detail. Recall that the redistribution of these\n10\n\nThis option only illustrates the effect of different on-shell projections in the four-particle phase space;\nif real photonic corrections were treated in DPA the impact of different projections could be larger.\n\n36\n\n\fsingular parts fixes only the universal, singular parts, while the redistribution of\nnon-singular parts is a mere convention. Owing to the asymmetric treatment of the\ncorrections (finite virtual in DPA, real and mass-singular virtual from full matrix\nelements), different redistributions of non-singular contributions change the result\nby terms of the order (\u03b1/\u03c0)(\u0393W /MW ), which is beyond the accuracy of the DPA.\nAs discussed in Section 4, RacoonWW allows to choose between two possible\ndefinitions of the finite part of the virtual photonic corrections to which the DPA\nis applied. As default, the subtraction-method-inspired approach (4.29) is chosen\n(\"def\") and compared to the YFS-inspired approach (\"eik\") (4.31). The two treate+ e\u2212 \u21924f\nments differ in the finite parts of the contribution d\u03c3virt,sing\n(see Section 4.3), which\nis subtracted from the virtual corrections in DPA and added in its exact form to the\nsingular part of the real photon corrections. As can be seen from the difference \u2206\nof (4.33), the ambiguity originates from terms of the form (\u03b1/\u03c0) \u00d7 \u03c0 2 \u00d7 O(1) which\nare either multiplied with the DPA or with the full off-shell Born cross sections.\n\u2022 On-shell versus off-shell Coulomb singularity:\nThe Coulomb singularity is (up to higher orders) fully contained in the virtual\nO(\u03b1) correction. Performing the on-shell projection of the DPA to the full virtual\ncorrection leads to the on-shell Coulomb singularity, which is a simple factor of\n\u03b1\u03c0/(2\u03b2). However, since the Coulomb singularity is an important correction in the\nLEP2 energy range and is also known beyond DPA [ 49], RacoonWW includes\nthese extra off-shell parts of the Coulomb correction as default. This replacement of\nthe Coulomb singularity is performed by adding and subtracting the corresponding\ncontributions in the virtual non-factorizable corrections, as described in Ref. [ 16].\nSwitching the extra off-shell parts of the Coulomb correction off (\"Coul\"), yields an\neffect of the order of the uncertainty of the DPA. Note that for CM energies close to\nthe W-pair-production threshold, the on-shell Coulomb singularity is not adequate,\nand the difference between on-shell and off-shell Coulomb singularity cannot be\nviewed as a measure of the theoretical uncertainty.\n\u2022 Imaginary parts of virtual corrections:\nAs default the imaginary parts of the loop integrals are neglected in RacoonWW.\nHowever, RacoonWW contains an option (\"imag\") that takes into account the\nimaginary parts. Since all contributions of these imaginary parts are proportional\nto the sine of the azimuthal decay angle of one of the W bosons and otherwise\ninvolve only symmetric functions of these angles, the imaginary parts drop out in\ndistributions where these decay angles are integrated over. The numerical check of\nthis cancellations can serve as a consistency check of RacoonWW. Moreover, this\noption might be useful for observables where the imaginary parts do not drop out.\nIn the following table and figures the total cross section and various distributions to\ne e \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc (\u03b3) are compared for the different versions of the DPA defined above in\nthe calo setup, i.e. with the loose recombination cut Mrec = 25 GeV. We consider the CM\nenergies 172 GeV, 200 GeV, and 500 GeV. The used lowest-order cross section is based on\nthe full 4f matrix element. \"Naive\" QCD correction factors and ISR corrections beyond\nO(\u03b1) are not included in the results of this section.\n+ \u2212\n\n37\n\n\fdef\n\n\u03c3/pb\n\u03b4/%\n\u03c3/pb\n\u03b4/%\n\u03c3/pb\n\u03b4/%\n\nproj\neik\nCoul\n\u221a\ns = 172 GeV\n400.39(22) 400.27(22) 400.03(22) 403.54(22)\n0\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.09\n0.79\n\u221a\ns = 200 GeV\n570.10(37) 569.93(37) 570.04(37) 570.85(37)\n0\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.01\n0.13\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV\n190.30(20) 190.28(20) 190.45(20) 190.31(20)\n0\n\u22120.01\n0.08\n0.01\n\nTable 4: RacoonWW predictions for the total cross section to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc (\u03b3) for\nthe calo setup at different CM energies in various versions of the DPA and the relative\ndifferences \u03b4 = \u03c3/\u03c3def \u2212 1\nThe results for the total cross section are shown in Table 4. We find relative differences\nat the level of 0.1% As expected, the prediction that is based on the on-shell Coulomb\ncorrection is somewhat higher than the exact off-shell treatment, since off-shell effects\nscreen the positive Coulomb singularity. As mentioned above, for the low CM energy of\n172 GeV the difference between on-shell and off-shell Coulomb singularity, which is quite\nlarge (0.79%), cannot be viewed as a measure of the theoretical uncertainty. While the\ndifference between the two on-shell projections is below 0.03%, the effect of including\ndifferent finite terms in the DPA (\"eik\") is at the level of 0.1% in the considered energy\nrange. When switching on the imaginary parts in the corrections we find the same results\nas without imaginary parts (\"def\").\nIn Figures 14, 15, and 16 we show the differences of the \"proj\", \"eik\", \"Coul\",\u221aand\n\"imag\" modifications to the default version of the DPA for some distributions at s =\n200 GeV. For the distribution in the cosines of the W-production angle \u03b8W+ and in the\nW-decay angle \u03b8W+ d\u0304 (Figure 14) the relative differences are of the order of 0.1% for all\nangles, which is of the expected order for the intrinsic DPA uncertainty. For the \u03bc-energy\ndistribution, shown on the l.h.s. of Figure 15, the differences are typically of the same\norder, as long\n\u221a as E\u03bc is in the range for W-pair production, which is 20.2 GeV < E\u03bc <\n79.8 GeV at s = 200 GeV. Outside this region, the four-fermion process is not dominated\nby the W-pair diagrams, and the DPA is not reliable anymore, which is also indicated\nby large intrinsic ambiguities. The r.h.s. of Figure 15 shows the DPA ambiguities for the\nud\u0304 invariant-mass distribution. Within a window of 2\u0393W around the W resonance the\nrelative differences between the considered modifications are also at the level of 0.1\u20130.3%.\nThe differences grow with the distance from the resonance point. As expected, we find\nthat the contribution of the imaginary parts to the production-angle and decay-angle\ndistributions and to the invariant-mass distributions are compatible with zero.\nFinally, we show in Figure 16 the difference between different versions of the DPA\nfor the distributions in the azimuthal angle between the decay planes of the two W\nbosons and in the azimuthal decay angle of the W+ boson.

The differences for the distributions in the W-decay angle \u03b8W+\u221a\nd\u0304 and in the ud\u0304 invariant mass, which are not flat, are illustrated in Figures 17 and 18 at s =\n\u221a172 GeV and\n500 GeV, respectively. As already stated above, for the low CM energy of s = 172 GeV\nthe difference between on-shell and off-shell Coulomb singularity cannot be viewed as an\nambiguity. \u221aOn the other hand, the effect of the Coulomb singularity is completely negligible for s = 500 GeV. Note also that the largest ambiguities, which can become of\nthe order of 0.5%, appear when the cross section becomes small. The large differences\nbetween the two different on-shell projections in the \u03b8W+ d\u0304 distribution at 500 GeV are\ndue to the increasing size and the larger angular variations of the relative corrections at\nhigher energies.

[ 3] we performed a detailed, tuned comparison of RacoonWW with a semianalytical calculation of the complete O(\u03b1) corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4 leptons in\nDPA by Beenakker, Berends and Chapovsky [ 19] (called BBC in the following) and with\nthe Monte Carlo generator YFSWW3 [ 20, 21]. Here we restrict ourselves to a brief\nsummary of the outcome and refer to Ref. [ 3] for more details. Moreover, we present a\nbrief comparison of the real-photonic corrections obtained by Jegerlehner and Kolodziej [\n48] (JK) based on an exact matrix-element calculation.\n7.4.1 Comparison with Berends, Beenakker and Chapovsky\nThe numerical comparison with BBC has been done for the purely leptonic channel\ne e \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc \u03bc+ \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . The conceptual differences between RacoonWW and the BBC\napproach are as follows: BBC treat both the virtual and real corrections in DPA, while\nthe complete real bremsstrahlung corrections and the universal leading-logarithmic part\nof the O(\u03b1) ISR correction are based on the exact CC11 matrix elements for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3\nand e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f in RacoonWW. The virtual corrections are treated in DPA in both\nprograms, but RacoonWW employs the full off-shell phase space with an appropriate\non-shell projection, whereas BBC have chosen the on-shell phase space with decoupled\ninvariant masses of the W bosons. These differences are (at least formally) beyond the\naccuracy of the DPA. Thus, if the complete photonic phase space is integrated over and\nvirtual corrections are added, both approaches yield results in DPA accuracy.\nFor the total cross section, the differences between the two approaches should be of the\nnaively expected accuracy of the DPA of 0.5% or better, whenever the DPA is applicable.\nWe found that both calculations agree very well above 185 GeV. Below this energy the\ndifferences in the implementation of the DPA become visible. The main effect originates\nprobably from the different treatment of the O(\u03b1) ISR and the phase space. While the\nuncertainty arising from the DPA is enhanced by leading ISR logarithms in the BBC\napproach, this enhancement is absent in RacoonWW.\nFor distributions unavoidable differences arise from the definition of the phase-space\nvariables in the presence of photon recombination. When defining the momenta of the\nW bosons for angular distributions, BBC choose to assign the photon to one of the\nproduction/decay subprocesses. The angles are then determined from the resulting W\nmomenta and the original fermion momenta. In RacoonWW, all angles are defined\nfrom the fermion momenta after eventual photon recombination. The two different angle\ndefinitions lead to a redistribution of events in the angular distributions, which arises,\nin particular, from hard photon emission. For the considered W-production-angle and\nW-decay-angle distributions the differences between BBC and RacoonWW turned out\nto be of the order of 1% at a typical LEP2 energy, with a tendency to increase with\nincreasing energy.\nInvariant-mass distributions of the W bosons depend crucially on the treatment of real\nphotons, which is done in a fundamentally different way in RacoonWW compared to\nthe treatment of BBC. Therefore, it does not make sense to compare these distributions\nbetween the two programs. Specifically, BBC define the W invariant masses from the\nfermion momenta only, i.e. without photon recombination at all. The resulting shifts in\n+ \u2212\n\n42\n\n\f\u00b1\nthe\n\u221a maxima of the distributions are negative, up to \u221277 MeV for e in the final state for\ns = 184 GeV, and dominated by mass singularities [ 19]. On the other hand, studies\nwith RacoonWW show that these shifts are in general positive and of the order of\nseveral 10 MeV [ 25, 26] if photon recombination is taken into account.\nFinally, we compared the photon-energy spectrum E\u03b3 (d\u03c3/dE\u03b3 ).\nSince the\nRacoonWW prediction for the E\u03b3 spectrum is not based on a DPA, but on the full\nmatrix element for 4f + \u03b3 production, this comparison can serve as a consistency check\nof the DPA for the real-photonic corrections as used by BBC. We find an agreement between the two approaches within \u223c 10%, which is of the order of the naive expectation\nfor the DPA error of O(\u0393W /\u2206E). Although these results illustrate the reliability of the\nnaive error estimate of the DPA used by BBC for the real corrections at least for LEP2\nenergies, this observation cannot serve as a proof that a DPA for real-photonic corrections\nwill work for any observable in any kinematical situation, as e.g. for higher energies.\n\n7.4.2 Comparison with YFSWW3\nIn contrast to the comparison with BBC, where some improvements of the DPA were\nswitched off in RacoonWW, in the comparison with YFSWW3 only the input parameters, cuts, and recombination procedures are chosen to be the same, but no further\nmodifications of the codes are made. Both event generators produce their \"best\" results,\nwhich can also be directly compared to the LEP2 data.\nWe compared the total CC03 cross sections for leptonic, semileptonic, and\n\u221a hadronic W+ \u2212\n\u2212\npair production channels and various distributions for e e \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc at s = 200 GeV\nfor the same setup as used in this paper.\nThe \"best\" results for the total cross sections obtained with RacoonWW and YFSWW3 when no cuts, bare or calo cuts have been applied are consistent with each other.\nThe relative differences amount to only 0.3%, which is within the expected DPA accuracy\nof 0.5%.\nThe comparison of the distributions has been done for both, calo and bare, recombination schemes. We found that the W-production-angle and W-invariant-mass distributions\nare statistically compatible with each other, i.e. they agree within 1%. We also compared\nseveral photon observables, such as the distributions of the photon energy, of the photon\nproduction angle, and of the angle between the photon and the nearest charged fermion\nand found relative differences at the 10% level. This is not surprising since visible photons\nare treated quite differently in RacoonWW and YFSWW3: while the predictions for\nphoton observables by RacoonWW are based on the exact lowest-order matrix element\nfor e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3, in YFSWW3 multi-photon radiation to W-pair production (within the\nYFS scheme) is combined with O(\u03b12 ) LL photon radiation in the W decays (done by\nPHOTOS).\n7.4.3 Comparison with Jegerlehner and Kolodziej\nIn Ref. [ 48] JK have evaluated some cross sections and distributions for semi-leptonic\nchannels e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 of the CC11 class. The calculation is based on the exact matrix\nelement with finite fermion masses, and finite gauge-boson widths are introduced in the\nso-called fixed-width scheme.

To this end, the virtual corrections\nare omitted in RacoonWW and consequently no DPA is needed. The real correction\nprovided by RacoonWW corresponds to the full e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3 cross section in the successive asymptotic limits \u03bb \u2192 0 and mf \u2192 0. The relative difference to the results of\nJK should thus be of the order of mf /MW , where mf is the largest fermion mass of the\nprocess. Table 5 shows a comparison of results for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ud\u0304\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03b3, where\nthe input parameters of Ref. [ 48] are used consistently, and the photon mass is set to\n\u03bb = 10\u22126 GeV. The parameter \u2206E\u03b3 represents the cutoff that separates the domains of\nhard and soft photon emission in the phase-space slicing approach. The matching of hard\nand soft photons is correct up to terms of O(\u2206E\u03b3 ), i.e. the exact results are formally\nreproduced for \u2206E\u03b3 \u2192 0. Since the 4f \u03b3 matrix elements in RacoonWW are based\non massless fermions, there is also a small acollinearity separation cut \u03b4c on all photon\nemission angles in the slicing approach; in the numerics we have set \u03b4c = 0.001. The\ninclusion of the collinearity regions, which involves finite fermion masses, is described in\nSection 4.2. The table shows acceptable agreement of the slicing and subtraction branches\nof RacoonWW with the results of JK.\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nA proper treatment of electroweak radiative corrections to the W-pair production process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW \u2192 4f is mandatory in order to account for the experimental accuracy\nat LEP2 and future linear colliders. A practical calculation of the O(\u03b1) corrections to\nthe full e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f process is beyond present possibilities. However, as long as W-pair\nchannels dominate, the combination of full lowest-order predictions for the four-fermion\nprocesses e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f with those corrections that are enhanced by two resonant W bosons\napproximates the full O(\u03b1)-corrected cross sections within a relative accuracy of 0.5%, at\nleast for not too high energies. A strategy for such a double-pole approximation (DPA)\nfor the O(\u03b1) corrections and its implementation in the Monte Carlo event generator\nRacoonWW are described in this paper.\nIn RacoonWW only the non-leading virtual O(\u03b1) corrections are treated in DPA,\nwhile real photonic corrections are based on full matrix elements for the radiative processes\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f \u03b3. In this way, potential problems in the definition of a DPA for real photon\n44\n\n\femission are avoided, and possible DPAs for the real corrections can be controlled. We\nhave shown explicitly how existing results for the corrections to on-shell W-pair production\nand W decay can be employed in the DPA; they define the class of so-called factorizable\ncorrections. For the remaining, non-factorizable contributions, which are due to photon\nexchange between the various production and decay subprocesses, we have completed\nthe results already given in the literature. Since virtual and real corrections are not\ntreated on equal footing, particular care is needed in the treatment of soft and collinear\nsingularities. The proper cancellation of these singularities has been discussed in detail; in\npractice two different methods (a subtraction method and phase-space slicing) have been\napplied. Finally, the leading contributions from initial-state radiation beyond O(\u03b1) have\nbeen included in RacoonWW, rendering this program a state-of-the-art calculation.\nFor LEP2 energies at detailed discussion of numerical results is presented, including total cross sections, angular and invariant-mass distributions. The consistency of\nRacoonWW is shown by comparing the results obtained with the subtraction method\nwith the ones of the slicing approach. Moreover, the reliability of the applied DPA is\ndemonstrated by various modifications of the DPA within its intrinsic freedom. The obtained intrinsic ambiguity supports the expectation that the theoretical uncertainty of\nthe used DPA is of the order of 0.5% for energies between 170 GeV and 500 GeV. Above\n500\u20131000 GeV, leading-logarithmic electroweak corrections of higher orders have to be\ntaken into account.\nAs a first phenomenological application of RacoonWW the predictions for the total\nW-pair production at LEP2 have been compared with LEP2 data and older \"improved\nBorn predictions\" of GENTLE, which were previously used in the data analyses. The\nRacoonWW results agree with the results of the new generator YFSWW3 but lie 2\u2013\n2.5% below the GENTLE predictions. The fact that the experimental LEP2 data favour\npredictions of RacoonWW and YFSWW3 can be viewed as empirical evidence for\nnon-leading electroweak radiative corrections beyond the level of universal effects.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank all the authors of Refs.

This can be ensured by fixing\n2\n2\nangles while performing the limit k\u00b1\n\u2192 MW\n. An obvious way is to fix the direction of one\nof the W bosons and of one of the final-state fermions originating from either W boson\nin the CM frame of the incoming e+ e\u2212 pair.
