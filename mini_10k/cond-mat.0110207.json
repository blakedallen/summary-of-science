The fusion mechanism we observe is\nvery different from the \"stalk\" hypothesis. Stalks do form on the first stage of fusion, but they do\nnot grow radially to form a hemifused state. Instead, stalk formation destabilizes the membranes\nand results in hole formation in the vicinity of the stalks.

The fusion process is\ncompleted by propagation of the initial connection, the stalk, along the edges of the aligned holes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nFusion of membranes is involved in basic biological\nprocesses but its mechanism remains poorly understood.\nThat different proteins trigger different fusion events obscures the possibility of a stage common to them, one\nwhich depends only on the properties of membrane bilayers themselves. The existence of such a universality is\nmade plausible by the realization that, in all fusion processes, membranes must merge, and the properties of the\nmembranes will most likely determine the nature of this\nstage, the fusion intermediate.1 Time and length scales\nof fusion events are of the order of microseconds2 and\nnanometers,3,4 so that direct measurements of intermediate structure have not been possible. Limited theoretical\ntreatment of this problem, based on membrane elasticity\ntheory, has focused on the so-called stalk mechanism.5\u20137\nIn this scenario, the leaves of the two cis membranes,\nclosest to one another, fuse forming a stalk. The stalk\nexpands radially and thins so that the trans leaves make\ncontact and form a single bilayer. This stage is denoted\nhemifusion. Hole formation in this bilayer completes the\nfusion pore. Due to the lack of direct experimental confirmation, this mechanism, although plausible, remains\nhypothetical.\nTo obtain a direct view of the fusion mechanism we\nhave undertaken the first Monte Carlo simulation of\nmembrane fusion, one in which membranes are treated\non the molecular level. In contrast to the stalk hypothesis, we find a very different fusion mechanism. Although\nstalk formation does take place in the initial stage of\nfusion, it does not result directly in the fusion pore. Instead, the stalk destabilizes the contacting bilayer membranes and promotes formation of transient holes next to\nit. When two holes are nucleated in apposing bilayers in\nthe vicinity of the stalk, the latter grows along the hole\nedges, sealing their periphery like a zipper, and eventually closes thereby forming the fusion pore.\n\nOur model describes membranes formed by singlechain amphiphiles, like block copolymers which exhibit\nthe same phases as do biological lipids, and also form\nvesicles.8 It has the advantage that it has been well studied, permits detailed analysis of molecular configurations,\nand is well suited to processes occurring on the small\ntime and length scales characteristic of fusion. The amphiphiles are treated using the bond fluctuation model9\nin which each molecular segment occupies a cube of a\nthree-dimensional lattice. The eight lattice sites defining the cube cannot be occupied by another segment\ncentered on neighboring sites. Segments along an amphiphile are\nby one of 108 bond vectors of\n\u221a connected\n\u221a\n\u221a\nlengths 2, 3, 5, 3 or 10, measured in units of the\nlattice spacing a0 . Mapping this model onto lipids in\nsolution,10 we find the lattice spacing to correspond to\napproximately 1\u00c5. The large number of bond vectors\nand the extended segment shape allow a rather faithful\napproximation of continuous space, while retaining the\ncomputational advantages of lattice models. The amphiphilic molecules consist of N = 32 segments, of which\n10 are hydrophilic and 22 are hydrophobic. This particular choice of the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic\nsegments results in the diblock system being close to coexistence of the lamellar and inverted hexagonal phases.\nThe solvent is represented by a homopolymer, chains consisting of 32 hydrophilic segments. Like segments attract each other and unlike segments repel each other\nvia a square well potential which comprises the nearest\n54 lattice sites. Each contact changes the energy by an\namount \u01eb = 0.177kB T . The particular choice of the interaction parameter \u01eb guarantees that the interfacial width\nbetween hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments is not too\nsmall to be comparable to the lattice spacing, and at the\nsame time results in well-defined bilayers.\nThe simulation cell is L \u00d7 L in the x, y directions and\nof length D in the z direction, with L = 156a0 and\nD = 96a0 . Periodic boundary conditions are utilized\nin all three directions. The monomer density of the system is \u03c1 = 1/(16a30), corresponding to 146,016 segments\n1\n\n\fwithin the volume, or 2376 amphiphiles and 2187 homopolymers. To encourage the fusion of the bilayers that\nwe study, we prepare them under tension by providing\nonly enough amphiphiles to form bilayers of thickness\n25a0 , thinner than their equilibrium thickness of 25.2a0,\nwhich we determined independently. Given that the system is nearly incompressible, this corresponds to a fractional increase of area of less than 0.8%, one easily sustained by biological membranes.11,12 Two such bilayers\nare created parallel to the x \u2212 y plane, stacked one upon\nthe other, thereby mimicking the dehydration which permits close bilayer contact, a circumstance known to promote fusion.13 Sixty-four independent starting configurations were prepared. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble. The conformations are\nupdated by local monomer displacements and slithering\u2013\nsnake like movements. The different moves are applied\nwith a ratio 1 : 3. The latter moves do not mimic the realistic dynamics of lipid molecules and we cannot identify\nthe number of Monte Carlo steps with time. However,\nthe density of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments is\nconserved and the molecules diffuse. Consequently, we\nexpect the time sequence on length scales larger than a\nsingle molecule to resemble qualitatively those of a simulation with more realistic dynamics.\nTo make sure that an isolated membrane is stable, we\nhave simulated a single bilayer under the above conditions. The system was extremely stable with respect to\nhole formation, apparently due to a very high energy cost\nto form the hole's edge, and exhibited the usual capillary\nwave fluctuations. In contrast, the system with two apposing membranes resulted in a range of structural transformations that eventually led to fusion pore formation.\n\nFIG. 1. The fusion intermediate.

(c) Top view of the layer\nbetween the two membranes. Hydrophilic segments are dark\ngrey, hydrophobic segments are light grey. (d) Side view of\nthe snapshot.\n\ncurvature energy. This reduction is roughly proportional\nto the length of the edge adjacent to the stalk.\nHole formation was a transient process, i.e. numerous\nholes were observed to open and close reversibly. Only\nwhen two holes, one in each bilayer, nucleated next to,\nand on the same side of, a given stalk did the final stage of\nthe fusion process commence. The stalk then propagated\nalong the edges of the two holes bringing them together,\nlike a zipper, to complete the fusion pore.\nWe show what one such partially formed pore looks\nlike in FIG. 1. Panel (b) presents the top view of the\ntwo membranes. Only tail segments are shown. The\npore through the two bilayers is clearly visible. Panel\n(c) presents the top view of the layer between the two\nmembranes. Hydrophobic segments are light grey, while\nhydrophilic segments are dark grey. Connectivity is established along a portion of the pore's rim by the stalk,\nwhile the two hydrophobic sheets are still unconnected\nelsewhere. This is confirmed by a side view through the\npore (d). A schematic of this intermediate is shown in\npanel (a).\n\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Qualitative observations\n\nInitially the apposed bilayers formed a number of local connections, the so-called stalks. Formation of these\nstalks was promoted by the system being near bulk coexistence between lamellar and inverted hexagonal phases.\nIn the stalk mechanism, these stalks grow radially and\neventually form transmembrane contacts. In contrast,\nwe observed anisotropic growth of the stalks, which resulted in the formation of structures whose length was a\nfew times that of their width. These may be precursors\nof line defects observed during the lamellar to invertedhexagonal transition.7\nFormation of the elongated stalks led to local destabilization of the bilayers. Holes formed next to these defects. We stress again that single, isolated, membranes\nwere very stable. Thus hole formation in the apposed bilayers is apparently due to inter-bilayer interactions expressed in the stalk formation. It is easily seen that a\nhole formed next to a stalk has a smaller edge energy, in\ncomparison to an isolated hole due to the reduction in\n\nB. Quantitative analysis\n\nAfter 62,500 attempted local monomer displacements\nper segment and 187,500 slithering\u2013snake movements per\nmolecule, we find that the initially sharp interface of the\nbilayers have widened, and profiles across the membranes\nhave adopted locally their stationary form. Profiles at a\nlater stage are broadened due to fluctuations of the local\n2\n\n\fmembrane position, and to the formation of holes in the\nmembranes. In order to reduce the effect of membrane\nfluctuations on our observation of the local profiles, we\ndefine at each x and y a local midpoint, zmiddle(x, y), of\nthe two-bilayer complex as follows.14 For each x, y and z,\nwe determine the total number of amphiphile segments,\nna (x, y, z), in a volume centered at these coordinates, of\nwidth B = 28 a0 in the lateral directions, and 50 a0 vertically, the thickness of two bilayers. The value of the coordinate z which maximizes na (x, y, z) defines zmiddle (x, y).\nWe have chosen a rather large lateral length scale, B, so\nthat a small hole in a single bilayer does not significantly\nalter our estimate for the midpoint of the two bilayers.\nTo analyze structural changes in the system, we looked\nnot only at the fusion pores traversing both bilayers, but\nalso at the holes in each bilayer which we found to occur\nabout an order of magnitude more frequently than pores.\nWe did this by calculating the local density of hydrophobic tail segments coarse grained over 4a0 \u00d7 4a0 square\ncolumns centered at x and y. Holes and pores should\nhave a very low, or vanishing, density of tails compared\nto the areal density of two normal bilayers. If the local\nvalue of the coarse-grained density of tail segments within\na column extending through the whole z-range falls below 25% of the normal areal density of the two bilayers,\nwe define this column as belonging to a pore traversing\nthem. To locate a hole in only one of the bilayers, the\nintegration over the z coordinate, rather than extending\nover the whole simulation box width, D, is limited to either the upper or lower half of it starting at the point\nbetween the two bilayers. If the local coarse-grained tail\ndensity falls below 25% of the normal areal density of\na single bilayer, the column belongs to a hole. Pores\nand holes are defined as the aggregate of nearest neighbor 4a0 \u00d7 4a0 plaquettes with low hydrophobic segment\ndensity.\nThe probability of hole sizes in the two apposed bilayers and the isolated bilayer are presented in FIG. 2.\nNot only is the absolute frequency of hole formation very\nmuch less in the isolated membrane than in the two apposed bilayers, but its decay with increasing hole size is\nalso much more rapid. This indicates that the edge free\nenergy of holes in the isolated bilayer is larger and corroborates the observation that stalk formation promotes\nhole formation when two bilayers are in contact.\nTo determine unambiguously whether fusion pore formation involves a stage in which the trans leaves make\ncontact, one unavoidable in the standard stalk mechanism, we perform a statistical analysis of the fusion intermediates observed in our simulations. We examine in\neach simulation run the first pore which exceeds a certain radius, Rmin = 5.5a0 , one sufficiently large that the\npore must be open; that is, there is a channel connecting\nupper and lower parts of the system accessible to solvent\nmolecules.\nOur strategy is to look at the region along the rim,\nor edge, of the pore in the pore's mid plane. If fusion\nproceeds via hemifusion this region has to be essentially\n\n10\n\ntwo bilayers apposed\nisolated bilayer\n\n-1\n\nP(R)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n10 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nR\n\nFIG. 2. Normalized probability distribution of the hole\nsizes in a bilayer. Circles refer to the system of two apposed\nbilayers, while squares denote the results for a single bilayer.\nData for the two apposed bilayers were collected from 64 systems and 750000 up to 956250 slithering\u2013snake steps. Data\nfor the single bilayer were sampled over 7 configurations but\nmuch longer times.\n\ncompletely hydrophobic. In contrast, if fusion proceeds\nthrough the formation of two transient holes in apposing\nbilayers, then we may see pores in an intermediate stage\nin which the holes are aligned, but the rim of the pore has\nnot fully formed. In such a case, the region along the rim\nof the pore would be at least partially hydrophilic. We\nmeasure the density of segments in a series of columns of\nheight 5a0 and base 4a0 \u00d7 4a0 centered along the rim of\nthe pore, which is defined as the points in the x \u2212 y-mid\nplane with a distance 14a0 \u00b1 2a0 from the center of the\npore. This distance corresponds to a sum of radius of the\npore, 5.5a0 , and half of the hydrophobic thickness of the\nbilayer, 8.5a0 .\nTo quantify the connectivity of the pore's rim, we extract the distribution of the density difference \u2206\u03c6 between hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments in this region. On average there are \u03c60 = 5 monomers in a column\nwhose volume is 4a0 \u00d7 4a0 \u00d7 5a0 . If the connectivity of\nthe hydrophobic regions of the two bilayers were complete, as in the stalk mechanism, then we expect the\nrim region to be hydrophobic, so that the distribution\nof \u2206\u03c6 from all these columns would exhibit a single peak\naround \u2206\u03c6/\u03c60 = \u22121. This is not at all what we see. Instead, only 12 pores have this single peaked distribution,\nwhereas the rest are either bimodal (37 configurations)\nwith a second peak centered about \u2206\u03c6/\u03c60 = +1 or have\na peak at \u2206\u03c6/\u03c60 = \u22121 with a long \"tail\" (15 configurations) toward positive \u2206\u03c6. From this we can conclude\nthat in the majority of cases there is a considerable portion of the rim which is still hydrophilic; that is, the rims\nof the two holes are only partially connected. The average of all distributions which we obtain are shown by the\nsolid circles in FIG. 3.

Although\nwe do not observe the standard stalk mechanism, our simulations do not rule it out under different thermodynamic\nconditions. Extensions of phenomenological approaches\nthat include the new observed intermediates should clarify this point. We expect the fusion intermediate we have\nseen in our simulation to be similar to that in biological\nmembranes. Its elucidation should facilitate the control\nand modification of the fusion process itself.\nNote: While preparing this manuscript, we learned\nthat Noguchi & Takasu,19 studying a very different system consisting of rigid amphiphilic molecules of three\natoms and containing no solvent, observed fusion behavior over a limited temperature range which is similar to\nthat we observed in our system. This may indicate a\nuniversality to the mechanism we have described.\n\n0.20\n\nP(\u2206\u03c6)\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u2206\u03c6/\u03c60\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3.

DISCUSSION\n\nThe fusion mechanism we propose is similar to that\nconsidered for electrofusion,15 with the addition that we\nspecify the form of the fusion intermediate. It is in accord with the recent observation in molecular dynamics simulations that lipid tails take on a much greater\nrange of configurations, including those sampling the hydrophilic region, when membranes are brought into close\ncontact.16 Our mechanism is similar in spirit to the initial\nstages of the mechanism of hemagglutinin-mediated viral\nfusion recently proposed by Bonnafous and Stegmann17\nwho suggest that before fusion can occur, a hole must\nfirst form in the target membrane. However they go on\nto suggest that this hole leads to fusion of the cis layers producing a hemifusion diaphragm in which a hole is\nnucleated. In contrast, hemifusion plays no role in the\nscenario we propose. We do observe strong mixing of amphiphiles in the cis leaves before pore formation. From\nsuch mixing, it is often inferred that hemifusion precedes\ncomplete fusion.18 Instead, we find that this exchange\nresults simply due to formation of the stalks.\nThe destabilization of the membranes by the stalks\nthat leads to formation of the transient holes in both bilayers, observed by us, is consistent with the work of Cevc\nand Richardsen13 who emphasize the fact that membrane\nfusion is strongly promoted by defects in the bilayer structure. It seems clear that the additional destabilization of\nbilayers by the defects embedded in the membranes prior\nto fusion facilitates formation of the transient holes necessary for fusion.\n\n1\n\nL.
