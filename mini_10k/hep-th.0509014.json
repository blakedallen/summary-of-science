Possessing a nonvanishing\nmagnetic moment, these solitons have also a nonzero angular momentum proportional to the electric\ncharge.\n\nIntroduction.\u2013 Many nonlinear classical field theories on flat spacetime backgrounds admit soliton solutions. These nonsingular solutions describe particle-like, localised configurations with finite energy. There\nhas been some interest in recent years in the issue of globally regular spinning soliton solutions. However,\nto the best of our knowledge, to date no stationary and spinning solitons were found. (We describe single\nlumps with angular momentum as spinning, and reserve rotating for more general (gravitating-) solutions,\nincluding multilumps.) Notably, it is known that that finite energy solutions of the Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH)\nsystem with a nonvanishing magnetic charge have zero angular momentum [1, 2] 1 . Moreover, as found in\n[5], none of the known gauge field solitons with gauge group SU (2) (e.g. dyons, sphalerons, vortices) admit\nspinning generalizations within the stationary, axially symmetric, one-soliton sector.\nTo date two types of spinning solitons have been found in the literature, a) Q-balls solitons in a complex scalar field theory with a non-renormalizable self-interaction [6], which are nontopological solitons so\ntheir stability is not guaranteed by a topological charge, and b) the electrically charged dipole monopole\u2013\nantimonopole pair [7] of the YMH system with vanishing topological charge, which is not topologically stable\neven in the limit of vanishing angular momentum.\nIt is our purpose here to construct a soliton which has intrinsic angular momentum and presents a\ntopologically stable limit 2 . Our definition for a 'soliton presenting a topologically stable limit' is, a finite\nenergy spinning lump which is topologically stable in the limit of vanishing angular momentum. This\nconfiguration corresponds to axially symmetric, electrically charged solutions of the U (1) gauged Skyrme\nmodel.\nConcerning the question of the existence of any given topologically stable solution, this is quite an intricate\nmatter that deserves a brief description. To start with, there must be a valid topological lower bound on\nthe energy, which may or may not be saturated, and for the Skyrmion it is not. Then there is the question\nwhether any given field configuration (the solution) does minimise the energy? For the Skyrme model, this\nis a difficult problem for two reasons: a) because the sigma model fields are constrained, and b) because in\naddition to the quadratic kinetic term there is also a quartic kinetic term. Thus for the 1-Skyrmion, the\nexistence proof is given by [9] and, [10], while for axially symmetric case, to the best of our knowledge, there\nis no rigorous existence proof. So axially symmetric Skyrmions and their magnetically gauged counterparts\nare supported only numerically.\nIn addition, when a nonvanishing electric field is present, as it is in the present work, the functional\nmisnimised is not the positive definite energy but the indefinite action. The proof of existence of such\nsolutions, namely that for YMH dyons, is given by [11], but again it is too hard to adapt this proof for the\ngauged (and ungauged) Skyrme model. Thus the existence of the U (1) gauged axially symmetric solutions\nof the present paper, and those of [8], are supported only numerically.\nThe model.\u2013 The Skyrme model has been proposed a long time ago [12] as an effective theory for nucleons\nin the large N limit of QCD at low energy [13, 14, 15], the baryon number being identified with the topological\ncharge. The classical as well as the quantum properties are in relatively good agreeement with the observed\n1 Also the axially symmetric spinning Einstein\u2013Yang-Mills sphalerons, although predicted perturbatively [3], are unlikely to\nexist [1, 4], but these are in anycase not topologically stable.\n2 An axially symmetric, spinning soliton of the ungauged Skyrme model, similarly presenting a topologically stable limit, has\nbeen recently constructed in [8]. However, this is a Q-ball type of solution featuring time-dependent fields.\n\n1\n\n\ffeatures of small nuclei. The U (1) gauged Skyrme model was originally proposed by Callan and Witten to\nstudy the decay of the nucleons in the vecinity of a monopole [16]. Axially symmetric solutions of this model\nwere constructed previously in [17], but the emphasis there was on the static properties of nucleons and not\nthe calculation of its classical spin.\nWe define our model in terms of the O(4) sigma model field \u03c6a = (\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6A ), \u03b1 = 1, 2; A = 3, 4, satisfying\nthe constraint |\u03c6\u03b1 |2 + |\u03c6A |2 = 1, the Lagrangean of the Maxwell gauged Skyrme model is (up to an overall\nfactor which we set equal to one)\n1\n1\n\u03ba2\nL = \u2212 |F\u03bc\u03bd |2 + |D\u03bc \u03c6a |2 \u2212\n|D[\u03bc \u03c6a D\u03bd] \u03c6b |2\n2\n2\n8\n\n(1)\n\nin terms of the Maxwell field strength F\u03bc\u03bd , and the covariant derivatives defined by the gauging prescription\nD\u03bc \u03c6\u03b1 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u03b1 + A\u03bc (\u03b5\u03c6)\u03b1\n\n,\n\nD\u03bc \u03c6A = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6A .\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor which follows from (1) is\n(\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03c4\u03bb\na\n\u03bb a\na\na\n\u03bb\n+ D\u03bc \u03c6 D\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03c6 D \u03c6\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u2212 2 F\u03bc\u03bb F\u03bc \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd F\u03c4 \u03bb F\n4\n2\n)\n\u0014\n\u0011 1\n\u0011\u0015\n\u0001\u0010\n\u0001 \u0010 [\u03c4\n\u03ba2\na\n\u03bb]\n\u03bb]\na\nb\na\na\n.\nD[\u03bd \u03c6 D \u03c6b \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd D[\u03c4 \u03c6 D\u03bb] \u03c6\nD \u03c6a D \u03c6b\nD[\u03bc \u03c6 D\u03bb] \u03c6\n\u2212 2*\n4\n4\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere we note that the Skyrmion gauged with the purely magnetic U (1) field is a topologically stable soliton.\nThis is stated in terms of topological lower bound on the static energy density functional of the purely\nmagnetically gauged system, namely the Ttt component of (3) with At = 0,\nTtt = E = |Fij |2 + |Di \u03c6a |2 +\n\n\u03ba2\n|D[i \u03c6a Dj] \u03c6b |2 .\n4\n\n(4)\n\nDefining the gauge invariant topological charge density as\n\u033a\n\n=\n=\n\n3\n1\n\u03b5ijk \u03b5abcd Di \u03c6a Dj \u03c6b Dk \u03c6c \u03c6d +\n\u03b5ijk Fij \u03b5AB \u03c6B \u2202k \u03c6A\n4\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n\u0001\n1\n3\n\u03b5ijk \u03b5abcd \u2202i \u03c6a \u2202j \u03c6b \u2202k \u03c6c \u03c6d \u2212\n\u03b5ijk \u2202k Ai \u03b5AB \u2202j \u03c6A \u03c6B\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nthe gauge invariance of \u033a is manifest from (5), while it is easily checked that the finite energy conditions lead\nto the vanishing of the surface integral term in (6), as a result of which the topological is simple the volume\nintegral of the first term, namely the winding number n or, Baryon charge.\nAs was shown in [17] in detail, the energy density functional (4) is bounded from below by\n\u03ba\nE\u2265 q\n\u033a.\n1 + 94 \u03ba\n\n(7)\n\nThe ansatz.\u2013 In a cylindrical coordinate system, we parametrise the axially symmetric Maxwell connection\nas\na(\u03c1, z) \u2212 n\nAt = b(\u03c1, z) , A\u03b1 =\n\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 x\u0302\u03b2 , Az = 0 ,\n(8)\n\u03c1\na(\u03c1, z) and b(\u03c1, z) corresponding to the electric and magnetic potentials, with n a positive integer - the\nwinding number, and the polar parametrisation of the chiral field in terms of the two functions f (\u03c1, z) and\ng(\u03c1, z) as\n\u03c6\u03b1 = sin f sin g n\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03c63 = sin f cos g,\n2\n\n\u03c64 = cos f,\n\n(9)\n\n\fp\nwhere \u03c1 = |x\u03b1 |2 , \u03b1 = 1, 2, and z = x3 . In the following we will find it convenient instead to work with\nspherical coordinates (r, \u03b8), i.e. \u03c1 = r sin \u03b8 and z = r cos \u03b8.

For solutions with parity reflection symmetry (the case considered in this paper), the boundary\nconditions along the z-axis are\nf,\u03b8 |\u03b8=0 = g|\u03b8=0 = 0, a,\u03b8 |\u03b8=0 = b,\u03b8 |\u03b8=0 = 0,\n\n(13)\n\nand agree with the boundary conditions on the \u03c1-axis, except for g(r, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2) = \u03c0/2.\nIt may appear from the boundary conditions (11)-(13) that the natural condition a|\u03b8=0,\u03c0 = n is not\nimposed. This is not done since its imposition in addition to (11)-(13) would be an an overdetermination.\nWe have nontheless checked that a = n is satisfied on the z-axis by the numerical solutions.\nThe constant V appearing in (11) corresponds to the magnitude of the electric potential at infinity and\nhas a direct physical relevance. In the pure Maxwell theory, one can set set V = 0 (or any other value)\nwithout any loss of generality. In the U(1) gauged Skyrme model, however, such a gauge transformation\nwould render the whole configuration time-dependent.\nR\n\u221a\nIntegration over all space of the energy\nE\nyields\nthe\ntotal\nmass-energy,\nE\n=\nTtt \u2212gd3 x.

The numerical calculations are performed by using the program CADSOL [18],\nbased on the iterative Newton-Raphson method. As initial guess in the iteration procedure, we use the\nspherically symmetric regular solutions of the pure Skyrme model.

The components T\u03c6t and Ttt of the energy momentum tensor are shown for a typical n = 1 solution, with\n\u03ba = 0.72, V = 0.067.\n\nFor a given Baryon number, the solutions depend on two continuos parameters, the values V of the electric\npotential at infinity and the Skyrme coupling constant \u03ba. Here we consider solutions in the one baryon\nsector only, although similar results have been found for n > 1. The solutions with V = 0 have b = 0 and\ncorrespond to static dipoles discussed in [17]. A nonvanishing V leads to rotating regular configurations,\nwith nontrivial functions f, g, a and b. Rotating solutions appear to exist for any value of \u03ba. As we increase\nV from zero while keeping \u03ba fixed, a branch of solutions forms. Along this branch, the total energy and\nthe angular momentum increase continuously with V . The ration J/E increases also, but remains always\nsmaller than one. At the same time, the numerical errors start to increase and we obtain large values for\nboth E and J, and for some Vmax the numerical iterations fail to converge. An accurate value of Vmax is\nrather difficult to obtain, especially for large values of \u03ba. Alternatively, we may keep fixed the magnitude of\nthe electric potential at infinity and vary the parameter \u03ba.\nIn Figure 1 we present the properties of typical branches of solutions. In Figure 1a, the angular momentum\nand the energy are parametrised by V for several fixed value of \u03ba, while in Figure 1b these quantities are\n\n5\n\n\fparametrised with \u03ba for several fixed values of V , including V = 0 corresponding to the non-spinning soliton.\nThe energy bound in the purely magnetically gauged case with V = 0 is not saturated, as is the case also\nfor the ungauged Skyrmion. We expect likewise that this numerically constructed solution is topologically\nstable, but cannot estimate the energy excess above the lower bound analytically.\nOne can see from Figure 1b that, for a given value of \u03ba, the energy of the spinning soliton is always\nsmaller than the energy of the ungauged Skyrmion, but is larger than the energy of the corresponding nonspinning static gauged solution. The latter is gauged only with the magnetic field and minimises the energy\nfunctional, while the spinning system gauged with both the magnetic and the electric fields minimises the\nnon-positive definite Lagrangian density, and the additional electric field does not feature in the topological\nlower bound. As a result, the spinning, electrically charged, solutions have higher energies than the static\nones. The situation here is identical with that of the Julia-Zee dyon, in this respect.\nIn Figure 2a we plot the energy density E = Ttt , and in Figure 2b the angular momentum density T\u03c6t of\na typical n = 1 solution as a function of the coordinates \u03c1, z, for \u03ba = 0.72, V = 0.067. We notice that the\nenergy density \u01eb = Ttt does not exhibit any distinctly localised individual components, a surface of constant\nenergy density being topologically a sphere. However, this is a deformed sphere such that the profiles of\nE = Ttt (r, \u03b8) versus r for each value of \u03b8 are distinct and non overlapping. It presents a peak on the symmetry\naxis, and the density profiles decrease monotonically with r.\nAlso, the electrically charged U (1) gauged Skyrmion rotates as a single object and the T\u03c6t \u2013component\nof the energy momentum tensor associated with rotation presents a maximum in the z = 0 plane and no\nlocal extrema (see Figure 2b).\nConclusions.\u2013 We have presented here the first example of spinning solution residing in the one-soliton\nsector of the theory which has a topologically stable limit. These solutions of the U (1)-gauged Skyrme model\ncarry mass, angular momentum, electric charge and a magnetic dipole momentum. The electric charge is\ninduced by rotation and equals the total angular momentum.\nSimilar qualitative results have been found by adding to the Lagrangean (1), a self-interaction potential\nof the O(4) scalar field representing the pion mass. Nonzero pion masses lead to larger values for the energy\nand angular momentum.\nAlso, we have found that similar to the ungauged case, the spinning Skyrmions admit gravitating generalisations, which are currently under study. These solutions satisfy also the generic relation (16).\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indepted to the referee for instructive comments, and to Yisong Yang for his generous advice.
