Rule (4) provides that mechanism. Using\nthis rule, a weak photon is emitted at the correct time for both the V and\n\u039b configurations, as well as for the two cascade configurations.\n\nIntroduction\nA single three-level atom has a ground state 0 and excited states 1 and 2. The\n\"strong\" decay (1-0) has a lifetime of about 10\u22128 s, and the \"weak\" decay (2-0)\nhas a lifetime of about 2s. The atom is exposed to two laser beams, where the\nfirst is tuned to the transition 0-1 and the second is tuned to 0-2.\nThe atom will oscillate rapidly between the ground state and the first excited\nstate for a period of time, giving off a visible light. It will then stop radiating\nand become dark for a period of time, after which it will resume the visible\nradiation. This light-dark florescent pulsing is thought to be due to the atom\nbeing trapped in the weak state 2 during the dark time [1, 2]. The florescent\nradiation is said by Dehmelt to be suspended for a time because the atom is\ntemporarily \"shelved\" in state 2.\nThe question is: What is the quantum mechanical mechanism that causes\nthis shelving? It is shown below that that mechanism is nuRule (4). The first\nof the nuRules provides for the existence of a stochastic trigger, and the other\nthree are textually included in the following. All four nuRules are listed in a\nprevious paper [3].\n\u2217 Department\n\nof Physics and Astronomy, State University of New York, Stony Brook,\nNew York 11794-3800, http://ms.cc.sunysb.edu/ \u0303rmould\n\n1\n\n\fThe Strong Interaction by Itself\nImagine that only the first laser (0-1) is turned on at time t0 . The first two\ncycles of the strong interaction will then take the form\n\u03a6(t = t0 ) =\n\nA0\n\n\u03a6(t \u2265 t0 ) =\n\nA0 + A1 + A0 \u03c6 + A1 \u03c6 + A0 \u03c6\u03c6 + ...\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A0 is the ground state of the atom and A1 is its excited state. In the\nsecond component, the atom has absorbed a photon from the laser beam, and in\nthe third component it has returned to the ground state and emitted a photon \u03c6.\nThe fourth and fifth components complete another cycle. The process repeats\nindefinitely. Laser photons are not shown.\nAfter t0 the second component acquires amplitude as a result of current flow\nfrom the first component, then the third component, then the fourth, etc. One\ncan imagine a pulse of states that proceeds from left to right in eq. 1, preserving\nnormalization. This results in a steady stream of photons leaving the atom\nevery 10\u22128 s, giving visible radiation.\nAdd a detector \u03a6 = A \u2297 D and the first two cycles will become\n\u03a6(t \u2265 t0 ) = (A0 + A1 ) \u2297 D0 + A0 D1 (+)A1 D1 (+)A0 D 2 (+)A1 D2 (+) ...\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the detector's ground state is D0 . After the first component (A0 + A1 ) \u2297 D0\nthe atom and the detector become entangled through the radiation field. Emitted photons are assumed to be immediately captured by the detector, so one\nphoton has been recorded by D1 and two photons by D2 .\nNuRule (2) requires that every component after the first component in eq. 2\nwill contain ready states. The underline in eq. 2 identifies these states. They\nare the basis states of a collapse, and they gain that status when the component they occupy is incoherent with the other components - generally through\nenvironmental decoherence.\nnuRule (2): If the Hamiltonian gives rise to new components that are locally\nincoherent with, and are discontinuous with the old components or with each\nother, then all states that are included in the new components will be ready\nstates.\nIn the case of eq. 2, all the new components are environmentally decoherent\nbecause of the macroscopic nature of the detector. The parentheses around\nthe + sign means that probability current cannot flow between the indicated\n\n2\n\n\fcomponents because of nuRule (4), which says that current cannot pass between\ncomponents that both contain ready states of the same object.\nnuRule (4): A transition between two components is forbidden if each is\nan entanglement containing a ready state of the same object.\nBecause of rule (4), the process in eq. 2 is stalled until there is a stochastic\nhit on A0 D1 at time tsc1 . That hit will make A0 and D1 realized states and\nwill reduce all other components to zero according to nuRule (3). A state that\nis not ready is called realized.\nnuRule (3): If a component containing ready states is stochastically chosen, then all of the states in that component will become realized, and all other\ncomponents will be immediately reduced to zero.\nThe above collapse also disentangles the atom from the detector because it\nprojects into exact eigenstates of the measurement, so at the time tsc1 of the\nstochastic choice we have\n\u03a6(t \u2265 tsc1 > t0 ) = (A0 + A1 ) \u2297 D1 + A0 D2 (+)A1 D2 (+) ...\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the new components (underlined) are all zero at tsc1 . The second component thereafter gains amplitude due to current flow from the first component.\nHowever, no current will flow into the third component in eq. 3 because of\nrule (4). After a second stochastic hit at time tsc2 the state of the system becomes\n\u03a6(t \u2265 tsc2 > tsc1 > t0 ) = (A0 + A1 ) \u2297 D2 + A0 D3 (+)A1 D3 (+) ...\n\n(4)\n\nand so forth. It is clear that each new cycle must await a stochastic hit before\nit can go to the next cycle. Each hit is followed by a renewal and a continuation\nof the process.\n\nA Competitor\nSince all the current from the initial state in eq. 2 flows into the second component, it is certain that there will be a stochastic hit on the second component\nat some time tsc1 . However, if there is a competing interaction in parallel with\neq. 2, then the current going into the second component will fall short of the\namount necessary to guarantee a hit on that component. In that case, the\ninteraction in eq. 2 will be stalled until the competing interaction has run its\n3\n\n\fcourse - however long that may take. This conclusion does not depend on the\ncompetitor being strong or weak relative to the interaction in eq. 2. The basic\nmechanism of the florescent pulse is thereby in place.\nImagine that only the second laser (0-2) is turned on at time t0 . The first\nthree cycles of the weak interaction will then take the form\n\u03a6(t = t0 ) = A0\n\u03a6(t \u2265 t0 ) = A0 + A2 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 + A2 \u03c6\u2032 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 + A2 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 ...\n\n(5)\n\nAdding the detector gives\n\u03a6(t \u2265 t0 ) = {A0 + A2 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 + A2 \u03c6\u2032 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 + A2 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 ...} \u2297 D0\n\n(6)\n\nbecause the detector does not interact with the primed photons that are products of the 2-0 decay.\n\nBoth at Once\nIf the first and second lasers are turned on together, then eqs. 2 and 6 will be\ncompeting processes. Starting with \u03a6(t = t0 ) = A0 \u2297 D0 , we get\n\u03a6(t \u2265 t0 ) =\n\nA0 \u2297 D0\n\n(7)\n\n+\n\nA1 \u2297 D0 + A0 D1 (+) ... from eq. 2\n\n+\n\n{A2 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 } \u2297 D0 + ... from eq. 6\n\nwhere both the second and the third rows must share the current flowing\nfrom the first row, and where the current received by the second row will be\nmuch greater than the current received by the third row. Therefore, in most\ncases A0 D1 in the second row will be stochastically chosen at time tsc1 giving\n\u03a6(t = tsc1 > t0 ) = A0 \u2297 D1 which begins the process all over again.\n\u03a6(t \u2265 tsc1 > t0 ) =\n\nA0 \u2297 D1\n\n+\n\nA1 \u2297 D1 + A0 D2 (+) ...\n\n+\n\n{A2 + A0 \u03c6\u2032 } \u2297 D1 + ...\n\n(8)\n\nmost probably resulting in another stochastic hit in the second row giving\n\u03a6(t = tsc2 > tsc1 > t0 ) = A0 \u2297 D2\n\n(9)\n\nIt is the rapid repetition of eqs. 7-9, that produces the radiation observed during\nthe florescent \"on\" time of the 3-level atom.\n4\n\n\fHowever, the third row in eq. 8 competes with the second row for current.\nThis means that the probability of a stochastic hit on A0 D2 in the second row of\neq. 8 might not occur; in which case, the square modulus of the component will\nstop increasing. When that happens A0 D2 will become a phantom component,\nlying dormant for a time. Its only function during this dormancy is to stall the\nstrong decay. The third row will then continue the evolution by itself. It will\ntake a (comparatively) long time to execute the cycle from A0 in the first row\nof eq. 8 back to A0 in the third row, resulting in the \"dark time\" of the 3-level\nflorescent pulse.\nWhen that execution is complete, current can again flow into A1 \u2297 D1 in\nthe second row, and then to the dormant phantom component A0 D2 . This\nwill reactivate the phantom, driving its square modulus closer to 1.0 than was\npreviously achieved. A stochastic hit accompanying this new surge of current\nwill generally start a new period of florescence; although it is possible that\nthere will be no stochastic hit, and instead, a second dark period will begin.\nFollowing such a second dark period, the phantom component will be given still\nanother chance to be selected. The probability is 1.0 that A0 D2 will eventually\nbe stochastically chosen, initiating a period of florescence that begins the full\ncycle over again.\n\nThe V and \u039b Configurations\nThe above arrangement of energy levels is called the V configuration because\nlevels 1 and 2 are above the ground level 0. It is a characteristic of this case that\nthe dark period ends with the emission of a weak photon [4]. This is confirmed\nin eq. 8 because \u03c6\u2032 appears in the last term in the third row, after the dark\nperiod is complete.\nIn the \u039b configuration levels 1 and 2 are below the ground level 0.

According to\nthese rules, a quantum mechanical state will not collapse unless an observer interacts with it; so \"objective\" measurements are not possible. When these original rules are applied to the 3-level atom, the behavior of the atomic/radiation\nsystem is the same as above. Florescent pulsing is therefore fully accounted for\nby the original rules; but in this case, pulsing does not occur unless an observer\nis present. Without an observer, the system will reach a steady \"unpulsed\"\nequilibrium as a result of the uninterrupted Schr\u00f6dinger process acting alone.\nThis may seem like an unacceptable result. But the fact is that there is no\nempirical way to determine whether or not there are florescent pulses without\nan observer on the scene. One might suggest that the system be recorded on\nvideo tape and observed much later, hoping thereby to disengage the observer\nfrom the detector. But that won't work. Because of non-local correlations, the\nresult would be the same as it is when an observer looks directly at the detector.\nThe result would confirm the existence of florescent pulsing. It would not tell\nus what happens when there is no observation at all. Therefore, we cannot\nempirically affirm or deny the existence of pulsing when there is no observer.\nThe idea that florescent pulsing depends on the presence of an observer\nmight be counterintuitive, leading one to abandon the original rules in favor of\nthe nuRules that give a more acceptable result. But since there can be no empirical evidence one way or the other, and since there is no currently established\ntheory of measurement that would settle the matter, it is wise to keep these\noptions open. Maybe florescent pulses are a consequence of observer/system\ninteraction. We are not accustomed to thinking that observers can have this\nkind of influence on physical systems under observation. But customary thinking for the last 400 years has placed the consciousness of an observer outside of\nthe universe, and that's not realistic either. Maybe, when we finally integrate\nconscious observers into the quantum mechanical universe, we will discover that\nwe (conscious creatures) play a role in Nature that we might not have otherwise\nsuspected. Therefore, we should wait and see which of these rule sets (the old\nrules or the nuRules) is most convincingly incorporated into a wider theoretical\nunderstanding.\nIt is important to realize that even the nuRules produce counterintuitive\nresults; namely, that florescent pulses require the existence of an atom/detector\ninteraction. Without a macroscopic detector present to make the measurement,\n\n7\n\n\fthe atomic system governed by the nuRules will not pulsate. The atom and laser\nfield by itself cannot produce ready states because the participating atomic levels\nare not mutually incoherent; so nuRule (4) will not be able to eliminate second\norder transitions among these levels. Because of this, the strong interaction\ncannot be brought to a halt while the weak interaction completes its cycle.\nThis result would probably please Niels Bohr, for it ties the existence of an\nobservable atomic phenomena directly to the macroscopic detector that is used\nto detect it.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
