This method is also successful for giving directly a basis for the homogeneous subspace\nof M\u03bc consisting of elements of 0 x-degree.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet \u03bc = (\u03bc1 \u2265 \u03bc2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bck > 0) be a partition of n. We shall identify\n\u03bc with its Ferrers diagram (using the French notation). To each cell s of\nthe Ferrers diagram, we associate its coordinates (i, j), where i is the height\nof s and j the position of s in its row. The pairs (i \u2212 1, j \u2212 1) occurring\nwhile s describes \u03bc will be briefly referred to as the set of the biexponents\nof \u03bc. Now let (p1 , q1 ), . . . , (pn , qn ) denote the set of biexponents arranged in\nlexicographic order and set\np\n\nq\n\n\u2206\u03bc (x, y) = \u2206\u03bc (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , yn ) = det(xi j yi j )i,j=1...n .\nLet M\u03bc be the collection of polynomials in the variables x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , yn\nobtained by taking the linear span of all the partial derivatives of \u2206\u03bc . For1\n\n\fmally we may write\nM\u03bc = L{\u2202xa \u2202yb \u2206\u03bc (x, y); a, b \u2208 Nn }\nwhere \u2202xa = \u2202xa11 . . . \u2202xann and \u2202yb = \u2202yb11 . . . \u2202ybnn . Then the n! conjecture can be\nstated as follows.\nConjecture 1 (n! conjecture): Let \u03bc be a partition of n, then dim M\u03bc = n!.\nThis conjecture, stated by A. Garsia and M. Haiman is central for their\nstudy of Macdonald polynomials (cf. [5], [6]). To be more precise, Macdonald\nintroduced in [12] a new symmetric function basis and associated MacdonaldKostka coefficients K\u03bb\u03bc (q, t), which are a priori rational functions in q, t.\nMacdonald conjectured that:\nConjecture 2 (MPK conjecture): The functions K\u03bb\u03bc (q, t) are polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients.\nLooking for a representation theoretical setting for the Macdonald basis,\nA. Garsia and M. Haiman made the following conjecture:\nConjecture 3 (C = H\u0303 conjecture): For the diagonal action of Sn , M\u03bc is\na bigraded version of the left regular representation. Moreover, if C\u03bb\u03bc (q, t)\ndenotes the bigraded multiplicity of the character \u03c7\u03bb in the bigraded P\ncharacter\nof the module M\u03bc then: C\u03bb\u03bc (q, t) = K\u03bb\u03bc (q, 1/t)tn(\u03bc) , where n(\u03bc) = ki=1 (i \u2212\n1)\u03bci .\nConjecture 3 clearly implies Conjecture 1 and 2. M. Haiman [9] using\nHilbert schemes theory recently proved that the n! conjecture actually implies\nthe C = H\u0303 conjecture. A part of the MPK conjecture is that the K\u03bb\u03bc (q, t)\nare polynomials, which is not obvious from their definition. This part has\nbeen recently proved in several independent papers (cf. [7], [8], [10], [11],\n[14]).\nWhen \u03bc = (1n ) or \u03bc = (n), \u2206\u03bc reduces to the Vandermonde determinant\nin x and y respectively. In these cases, it is a classical result (see [2]) that\ndim M\u03bc = n!. But although this conjecture has been verified by computer\nfor small partitions up to n = 8 and proved for some special cases (cf. [1],\n[4], [6], [13]), it has not been established in full generality. Several methods\nhave been developed to prove the n! conjecture but none of them has been\nable to give a proof in more than some special cases.\nIn this paper our goal is to propose a new method to prove the n! conjecture for some particular partitions. We want to construct explicit bases\nfor the space M\u03bc . These bases are made of monomial derivatives of \u2206\u03bc .\nWe present here how we are able to do it for hook-shaped partitions, i.e.,\n2\n\n\f\u03bc = (K + 1, 1L ) with K + L + 1 = n. In section 2 we describe the way to\nconstruct the basis and prove that its cardinality is n!. In the third section\nwe show that our family spans M\u03bc . Moreover, we derive from that proof an\nexplicit and simple basis for I\u03bc , the annihilator ideal of \u2206\u03bc . In the fourth\nsection we prove by a completely new method that the elements of our basis are linearly independent. In section 5 we explain how this method is\nalso successful for the homogeneous subspace of M\u03bc consisting of elements\nof 0 x-degree. We obtain in fact a direct way to construct a basis for this\nsubspace.\n\n2\n\nConstruction and enumeration\n\nLet \u03bc be a partition of n whose Ferrers diagram is a hook, i.e., \u03bc = (K +1, 1L )\nwith K + L + 1 = n.\n\n2.1\n\nConstruction\n\nLet us take an horizontal axis. A \"shape\" associated to \u03bc is constructed\nthe following way: suppose the line has room for K + L spaces. Choose K\nof these spaces to be y-columns and L to be x-columns. In the y-columns\nplace stacks of boxes above the line of height K, K \u2212 1, . . . , 1 arranged in\ndecreasing order. In the x-columns place stacks of boxes of decreasing depth\nL, L \u2212 1, . . . , 1 below the line.\nHere is an example of shape:\n\ny\n\nx\n\nassociated to the partition:\n\n3\n\n\fWe shall now put crosses in the cells of the shape to obtain \"drawings\".\nAs we shall not distinguish two drawings with the same number of crosses in\neach column, we put the crosses near the axis. The rules for putting crosses\nin a drawing are the following:\n1. the number of crosses in the x-columns is any number (not greater than\nthe depth of the column);\n2. the number of crosses in the y-columns depends on the x-crosses. For\na column which has no x-column to its right, the number of crosses is\nnot greater than the height of the column. In the other case, we look\nat the first \"plain\" x-column on the right; i.e., the first column which\nhas only crosses (full x-column) or only white cells (empty x-column).\nThere is always one, at least the x-column of depth one. Then:\n\u2022 if it is all white, then we impose at least one cross in the y-column.\n\u2022 if it is all crossed, then we impose at least one white cell in the\ny-column.\nRemark 1: The family of drawings that we defined is invariant under the\noperator that inverts the white cells and the crosses. We call this operator\nflip (it is different from the flip introduced by A. Garsia and M. Haiman in\n[6], that we denote from now on by Flip).\nHere we give an example of drawing with crosses:\n\n4\n\n\fy\n2\n1\n\n4\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n6\n\nx\n\nOnce we have defined the drawings (with crosses), we define associated\nderivative operators. We give an index to the places of the drawing from\nleft to right and from 1 to n \u2212 1. Then to each x-cross in place i, we\nderive once with respect to xi . We do the same thing for the y-crosses.\nFor example, for the last drawing, the associated derivative operator is:\n\u2202D = \u2202y12 \u2202x2 \u2202x4 \u2202x25 \u2202y6 .\n\n2.2\n\nEnumeration\n\nWe shall denote by D the set of drawings that we defined in the previous\nsubsection. We now verify that its cardinality is n!.\nAs the number of choices for the y-columns depends only on the shape\nof the drawing (and not on the x-crosses), we can write that the cardinality\nequals the following expression, where k1 denotes the number of y-columns\non the right of the last x-column:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\nk2 + L \u2212 1\n2 * 3 * * * (k1 + 1) * (k1 + 1) * * * (k1 + k2 ) * (L + 1)!\nk2\nk +k =K\n1\n\n2\n\n= L(L + 1)K!\n\nK\nX\n(k2 + L \u2212 1)!\n(K + 1 \u2212 k2 )\nk2 !\n\nk2 =0\n\n= (L + 1)!K!\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\nK \u0012\nX\nK + 1 \u2212 k2\nL \u2212 1 + k2\n\n1\nL\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0012\nK +L+1\n= (K + L + 1)!\n= (L + 1)!K!\nL+1\nk2 =0\n\nby the Chu-Vandermonde formula ([3], p. 163).\n5\n\n\f3\n\nProof that the family spans M\u03bc\n\nWe show here that {\u2202D \u2206\u03bc }D\u2208D spans M\u03bc . We begin by studying I\u03bc , the\nannihilator ideal of \u2206\u03bc .\n\n3.1\n\nStudy of I\u03bc\n\nFor P, Q two polynomials, we write P \u2261 Q if P (\u2202)\u2206\u03bc = Q(\u2202)\u2206\u03bc , i.e.,\nP \u2212 Q \u2208 I\u03bc (P (\u2202) corresponds to the substitution: xi \u2192 \u2202xi , yi \u2192 \u2202yi ). We\ndenote as usual by hk the k-th complete homogeneous symmetric function.\nLet also X denote a subset of (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ), YQa subset of (y1 , Q\ny2 , . . . , yn ),\n|X| and |Y | their cardinality. We also set X\u0304 = x\u2208X x and \u0232 = y\u2208Y y.\nWe first notice that:\n1. for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, xi yi \u2261 0;\n2. X\u0304 \u2261 0 as soon as |X| > L;\n3. \u0232 \u2261 0 as soon as |Y | > K;\n4. for any symmetric homogeneous polynomial P of positive degree, P \u2261\n0.\nThe fourth relation is well known (cf. [2]). The others are clear by observing\nthe elements in the determinantal form of \u2206\u03bc when \u03bc = (K + 1, 1L ).\nProposition 1:\nhk (Y ) \u2261 0\nas soon as k > 0 and k + |Y | > n.\nProof. It is easily proved by an induction based on hk (y1 , . . . , yn ) \u2261 0 for\nall k > 0. We have indeed h1 (Yn ) \u2261 0, where Yn = (y1 , . . . , yn ) and for any\ny 6\u2208 Y :\nhk (Y, y) = hk (Y ) + yhk\u22121(Y, y).\n\u0003\nProposition 2:\n\u0232 hk (Y \u2032 ) \u2261 0\nas soon as k > 0, k + |Y | > K and Y \u2282 Y \u2032 .\nProof. Proposition 2 is proved by decreasing induction on |Y \u2032 |.\n6\n\n\fWe observe that the result is true for |Y \u2032 | equal to K + 1 and K. Let Y\nand Y \u2032 satisfy the hypotheses and assume the result is true down to |Y \u2032 | + 1.\nWe write for all yi 6\u2208 Y \u2032 :\nhk (Y \u2032 , yi ) \u2261 hk (Y \u2032 ) + yi hk\u22121 (Y \u2032 , yi ),\nthus, by induction if k > 1 we obtain the following relation; this relation is\nobvious if k = 1 because this implies that |Y | \u2265 K:\n\u0232 hk (Y \u2032 , yi ) \u2261 \u0232 hk (Y \u2032 ).\nOnce we have this relation the conclusion easily follows by an increasing\ninduction on |Y \u2032 | (for example up to n).\n\u0003\nProposition 3:\nhk (Y )hl (X) \u2261 0\nas soon as k > 0, l > 0, k + l + |Y | + |X| \u2265 2n and X \u2282 Y or Y \u2282 X.\nProof. We only show the result when k + |Y | = n and l + |X| = n (the\nother cases are consequences of Proposition 1).\nIt is in fact proved as Proposition 1 by a simple induction based on:\nh1 (x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 )h1 (y1 , . . . , yn\u22121 ) \u2261 0\nwhich is a consequence of Proposition 1 and xn yn \u2261 0.\n\u0003\nProposition 4:\nhk (Y )hl (X) \u2261 0\nas soon as k > 0, l > 0 and\n\u2022 either Y \u2282 X and k + l + |Y | > n,\n\u2022 or X \u2282 Y and k + l + |X| > n.\nProof. This is proved by induction on \u03b1 = 2n \u2212 (k + |Y | + l + |X|).\nThe case \u03b1 \u2264 0 reduces to Proposition 3.\nSuppose the result is true up to \u03b1 \u22121 and 2n\u2212(k + |Y | + l + |X|) = \u03b1 > 0.\nBy symmetry, we shall assume that Y \u2282 X and k + l + |Y | > n. If l > 1,\nthen for any xi 6\u2208 X, we write:\n7\n\n\fhk (Y )hl (X) \u2261 hk (Y )hl (X, xi ) \u2212 xi hk (Y )hl\u22121 (X, xi )\n\u2261 hk (Y )hl (X, xi ) \u2212 xi hk (Y, yi )hl\u22121 (X, xi ) \u2261 0\nby induction.\nIf l = 1, then |Y | + k \u2265 n and we write for any xi 6\u2208 X:\nhk (Y )h1 (X) \u2261 hk (Y, yi )h1 (X) \u2212 yi hk\u22121(Y )h1 (X, xi ).\nThe first term is zero by Proposition 1. The second term is proved to be also\nzero by increasing induction on |X| (up to n), since n \u2212 k \u2264 |Y | \u2264 |X| \u21d2\nn \u2212 |X| \u2264 k.\n\u0003\n\n3.2\n\nApplication\n\nWe shall show here that any monomial derivative of \u2206\u03bc is a linear combination of the derivatives: {\u2202D \u2206\u03bc }D\u2208D (derivatives corresponding to drawings,\ni.e., the family defined in section 2).\nTheorem 1: {\u2202D \u2206\u03bc }D\u2208D spans M\u03bc .a\nProof. It is clear that any monomial can be associated to a diagram\nof crosses (by the same process as in paragraph 2.1), and let D be such a\ndiagram which is not a drawing.\nWe look at the rightmost \"anomaly\", that is the rightmost place where\nthe diagram D associated to the monomial can not be a drawing (we call\nthis place \"guilty\").\n- Case 1: the diagram D could not be put in a set of ordered columns (i.e.,\nin the shape of a drawing). This case gives four subcases. Assume the\nguilty column is a y-column. We can not put another y-column on the\nright. Either because each y-column on the left has a cross (case 1a),\nor because there is no first plain and white x-column on the right (case\n1b). If the guilty column is an x-column, we are led to cases 1c (each\nx-column on the left has a cross) and 1d (there is no first plain and\nwhite y-column on the right). Since the rules are not involved here the\nproblems are symmetric for x or y.\n8\n\n\f- Case 2: the diagram D could be put in a set of ordered columns but the\nrules are broken. Either for the white cells (case 2a), or for the crosses\n(case 2b).\nWe shall prove, using the propositions of the last section, that the monomial associated to the diagram D can be written modulo I\u03bc as a linear\ncombination of monomials strictly smaller with respect to the lexicographic\norder (x1 < x2 < * * * < xn < y1 < * * * < yn ). We look at each case that we\nhave mentioned above.\n\u2022 Case 1b with no x-column on the right is solved by Proposition 1, as\nwell as case 1d with no y-column on the right.\n\u2022 Cases 1a and 1c are symmetric and treated by Proposition 2: we note\nthat the height of the h-th y-column is K \u2212h+ 1. If it has k + 1 crosses,\nthere is a problem if k + h > K. It then can be treated by Proposition\n2: we take Y \u2032 = Y = {i1 < . . . < ih }, to be the places of the first h\ny-columns, each of which has at least one cross. The monomial is a\nmultiple of\n\u0232 yikh \u2261 \u0232 (yikh \u2212 hk (Y ))\nand all monomials in the expansion of the right side are lexicographically smaller than the monomial on the left side.\n\u2022 Case 2a is immediately settled by inverting the involved columns.\nTherefore the only remaining cases are case 1b (resp. 1d) with a first full\nx- (resp. y-) column on the right and case 2b.\n\u2022 Let us first study the case 2b.\n\nk\n\nk' y-col.\n\nk'' y-columns\n\nl' x-col.\n\nl l'' x-columns\n\n9\n\n\fWe observe that there is a problem if one has simultaneously:\n\u2013 k = k \u2032 + k \u2032\u2032 + 1,\n\u2013 l = l\u2032\u2032 + 1,\n\u2013 there is a cross in each of the l\u2032 x-columns between the two columns\nappearing on the figure.\nLet:\n\u2013 Y denote the places on the left of the y-column plus the place of\nthe y-column plus the l\u2032 places of the x-columns between the yand the x-column on D plus the place of the x-column,\n\u2013 X denote the places on the left of the x-column plus the place of\nthe x-column itself,\n\u2013 X \u2032 denote the places of the l\u2032 x-columns between the y- and the\nx-column of D.\nWe shall be able to express the monomial corresponding to this D as\na linear combination of monomials stricly smaller with respect to the\nlexicographic order if we establish that\nhk (Y )hl (X) \u2261 0.\nIndeed the leading monomial of X\u0304 \u2032 hk (Y )hl (X) (for the lexicographic\norder), in which we delete the multiples of xi yi for any i, is a divisor of\nthe monomial associated to D.\nWe want to apply Proposition 4 with |Y | = n \u2212 (k \u2032 + k \u2032\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1) and\n|X| = n \u2212 (k \u2032\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1). We have Y \u2282 X and we calculate:\nk + l + |Y | \u2212 n = 1 > 0.\nHence we are done in this case.\n\u2022 Let us now consider the case 1d with a first full y-column.\n\n10\n\n\fk\nk' y-col.\n\nk'' y-columns\n\nl' x-col.\n\nl'' x-columns\n\nl\n\nHere a problem occurs if:\n\u2013 k = k \u2032\u2032 + 1,\n\u2013 l \u2265 l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 2,\n\u2013 there is a cross in each of the k \u2032 y-columns between the two\ncolumns appearing on the figure.\nWe proceed as in the previous case. We want to use Proposition 4 to\nshow that\nhk (Y )hl (X) \u2261 0\nwith Y corresponding to all the places strictly left of the y-column on\nthe diagram D and X corresponding to all the places up to the xcolumn, plus the places of the k \u2032 y-columns between the x-column and\nthe y-column.\nWe want to apply Proposition 4 with |X| = n \u2212 (l\u2032 + k \u2032\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 2) and\n|Y | = n \u2212 (k \u2032\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1). We have X \u2282 Y and we compute:\nk + l + |X| \u2212 n \u2265 1.\nThus this case is also settled.\n\u2022 It remains to observe that the case 1b with a first full x-column is\ntreated by case 2b.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is now complete.\n\u0003\n11\n\n\f3.3\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can deduce from what precedes a basis for the ideal I\u03bc when \u03bc is a hook,\nsince the first relations exposed at the beginning of the study of I\u03bc were\nsufficient to prove that our family is a basis of M\u03bc .\nTheorem 2: If we denote by hGi the ideal generated by a set G, then for\n\u03bc a hook partition of n, we have:\nI\u03bc = hhi (Xn ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; hi (Yn ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n;\nxi yi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; X\u0304, |X| = L + 1; \u0232 , |Y | = K + 1i.\nProof. To prove this we assume that the previous ideal (we denote it by\nI) is not equal to I\u03bc , so that there is a polynomial P in I\u03bc \\I. According\nto the proof of Theorem 1, we can decompose it as P = A + Q, where A is\na linear combination of monomials of our family and Q is an element of I.\nTaking the derivatives and applying it to \u2206\u03bc , we obtain A(\u2202)\u2206\u03bc = 0. As we\nshall see in section 4, this implies A = 0, and P = Q \u2208 I.\n\u0003\n\n4\n4.1\n\nProof of the independence\nExposition and reduction of the problem\n\nWe shall now prove that our family is an independent set.\nSince the derivative operator associated to a drawing D depends only on\nthe crosses and not on the shape of the drawing, we define S as the diagram\nconsisting only of the crosses of D. We also define T as the diagram consisting\nof the white cells (a \"complement\" of S).\nLet S denote the set of S when D varies in D, the set of drawings defined\nin section 2.\nFor example, for the drawing in section 2, we have:\n\nS=\n\n12\n\n\fT=\n\nLet now \u2202S and \u2202T denote the derivative operators associated to S and\nT (after putting crosses in all the cells of T ).\nTheorem 3:\nThe family {\u2202S .\u2206\u03bc }S\u2208S is an independent set.\nLemma 1:\nS or T determines the drawing from which it comes.\nProof. Indeed, we can recontruct the shape of the drawing from S by\nproceeding from left to right. The method is the following: if there are\ncrosses at the place we are looking at, we complete the column with respect\nto the size of the successive columns. If there is no cross, we look at the\nx-crosses on the right: if they can fit in with one x-column missing, then we\nput an x-column at the empty place, else we put a y-column.\nThe method is the same for T since the family is invariant under flip.\n\u0003\nLet us now show that the family is linearly independent. Let us begin\nwith some definitions. Let D = (S, T ) and D1 = (S1 , T1 ) be two different\ndrawings; we shall say that D1 is a son of D if \u2202T \u25e6 \u2202S1 .\u2206\u03bc \u2208 Z\\{0}. We\nshall denote by T + S1 the figure corresponding to the superposition (place\nby place) of the cells of T and S1 (all these cells being crossed). If we repeat\nthis process, we obtain the notion of descendant.\nLemma 2:\nTo show the independence, it is sufficient to prove that a drawing can not\nbe its own descendant (i.e., there is no \"loop\").\nP\nProof. We assume we have a relation of dependence:\nS cS \u2202S .\u2206\u03bc = 0,\nthat the coefficients are not all zero, and that there is no loop. Then we take\na S0 for which cS0 6= 0. If S0 has no son or if they have all cS equal to zero,\nwe obtain a contradiction by applying \u2202T0 to the relation and by looking at\n13\n\n\fthe constant term of the result. If S0 has a son S1 for which cS1 6= 0, we\nrepeat with S1 . As the set is finite and there is no loop, we certainly obtain\na S \u2032 which gives a contradiction.\n\u0003\nSo we have to prove that there is no loop. It is sufficient to show that\na drawing D = (S, T ) is different from all its descendants that have the\nsame shape (i.e., the x-columns at the same places). Let D \u2032 = (S \u2032 , T \u2032 ) be a\ndescendant of D that has the same shape. We want to show that D 6= D \u2032 .\n\n4.2\n\nDefinition of completeness\n\nTo explain this notion, let D1 denotes a drawing and D2 one of its sons. We\ndefine on the places of D2 a notion of \"completeness\" (relative to D1 too)\nas follows: We say that the first k places of D2 are complete if the heights\nof the y-columns of T1 + S2 in these k places and read from left to right are\nK, K \u2212 1, K \u2212 2, . . . and if we have the same for x-columns.\nWe want now to obtain a (more quantitative) characterization of the\ncompleteness. To do this we need to introduce some more definitions.\nWe look at the left parts (made of the first k \u2212 1 places) of D1 and D2 .\nWe define d as the difference between the number of times where a y-column\nof D1 has been replaced in D2 by a white x-column and the number of times\nwhere an x-column of D1 has been replaced in D2 by a white y-column. We\nalso define d\u2032 as the difference between the number of times where a crossed\ny-column of D1 has been replaced in D2 by an x-column and the number of\ntimes where a crossed x-column of D1 has been replaced in D2 by a y-column.\nWe should note that d and d\u2032 are relative to k \u2212 1.\nSince the problem is symmetric with respect to x and y (as long as we do\nnot use the rules of construction), we shall only examine the case where we\nderive with respect to yk , i.e., where there is a y-column at the k-th place of\nT1 + S2 . The symmetric case has a similar characterization (with opposite\nsigns for d and d\u2032). We now introduce the following notations: b1 (resp. b2 )\ndenotes the number of white cells at place k in D1 (resp. D2 ) and c1 (resp.\nc2 ) the number of crosses. The characterization can now be stated as follows:\nCharacterization :\nIf the first k \u2212 1 places are complete, the k-th is complete if one of the\nfollowing conditions is verified:\n\n14\n\n\f1. at place k in D1 and D2 there is a y-column and b2 = b1 + d and\nc2 = c1 + d\u2032 (each of these equalities easily implies the other);\n2. at place k, there is a crossed x-column in D1 (i.e., b1 = 0) and a\ny-column in D2 , and b2 = d;\n3. at place k, there is a y-column in D1 and a white x-column in D2\n(c2 = 0), and c1 = \u2212d\u2032 .\nProof. To prove this result, we begin by observing that we can not have\nx- and y- cells at the same place in T1 + S2 : when \u03bc is a hook, we have\n\u2202xi \u2202yi \u2206\u03bc = 0. There are in fact three possibilities for the columns at place\nk:\n1. D1 and D2 have a y-column;\n2. D1 has a crossed x-column and D2 a y-column;\n3. D1 has a y-column and D2 a white x-column.\nWe deal with these three cases.\n1. Case 1: if in T1 + S2 the heights of the y-columns in the first k \u2212 1\nplaces are K, K \u2212 1, . . ., K \u2212 l + 1 and if our y-column is the h-th\nof D2 , we observe that l = h \u2212 1 + d. The height of the y-column of\nT1 + S2 at place k is at most K \u2212 l. But if we observe that the height\nof the h-th y-column of D2 is K \u2212 h + 1, we obtain:\nb1 + c2 \u2264 K \u2212 l = K \u2212 h + 1 \u2212 d = b2 + c2 \u2212 d.\nHence b2 \u2265 b1 + d and equality holds when it is complete. As b2 + c2 =\nb1 + c1 + d + d\u2032 , the equality c2 = c1 + d\u2032 holds too.\n2. Case 2: this case is treated like Case 1.\n3. Case 3: the reasoning is similar to Case 1. If our y-column is the h-th\nof D1 and if in the first k \u2212 1 places of T1 + S2 the successive y-columns\nhave height K, K \u2212 1, . . ., K \u2212 l + 1, then l = h \u2212 1 \u2212 d\u2032 . As the height\nof the y-column at place k of T1 + S2 is at most K \u2212 l, we deduce that\nc1 \u2265 \u2212d\u2032 , with equality corresponding to completion.\n\u0003\n15\n\n\fRemark 2: If the first k \u2212 1 places are complete but not the k-th, we\nobserve easily that it corresponds to an increasing of the number of white\ncells in D2 . We have indeed seen in the proof that b2 \u2265 b1 + d and c2 \u2264 c1 + d\u2032\nin Case 1 and similar inequalities in Cases 2 and 3.\nRemark 3: We observe that the Cases 2 and 3 can not happen simultaneously since we can not have at the same place a crossed column in D1 and\na white column in D2 (there is at least one cell at each place).\nOnce we have obtained this characterization of completeness, we shall use\nit to progress in the proof of Theorem 3.\n\n4.3\n\nApplication\n\nLemma 3:\nIf we have completeness on the first k places along the chain between two\ndrawings D and D \u2032 with the same shape, then the sum of the d along the\nchain is equal to zero, as well as the sum of the d\u2032 (d and d\u2032 relative to the\nfirst k places).\nWe will first apply this result in the following lemma and prove it after\nLemma 4.\nLemma 4:\nIf we have completeness on the first k places between D and D \u2032 , then these\ntwo drawings are identical on the first k places.\nProof. To prove this result we shall use Lemma 3. Indeed we notice that\nif we keep either an x- or a y-column at place k along the chain between D\nand D \u2032 , the result is obvious since (by Lemma 3) theP\nsum of the d is equal\n\u2032\nto zero. With natural notations, we have: b = b + d = b. Now, if the\n\"shape\" of the column at place k changes, let us observe the two following\ncases (by symmetry we look at the changes for a y-column):\n\n16\n\n\f1:\n\n1:\n\n2:\n\n2:\n\n(simple arrows mean single generation, broken arrows mean possibly several\ngenerations, but at fixed shape at place k).\nIn view of the characterization of completeness, we observe that we have\nin both cases: b2 = b1 + d, c2 = c1 + d\u2032 , as if we had not changed the shape\n(it is easily seen by looking at the d on the left and at the d\u2032 on the right).\nBy Lemma 3, we are now able to remove the condition that the shape\ndoes not change at the broken arrows. Indeed, we begin by reasoning about\nchains as above, then we can ignore the change of shape. By this method we\nobtain the general result (analogy with a Dick path for which we repeat the\nremoving of sequences \u2228 and \u2227).\n\u0003\n17\n\n\fProof of Lemma 3. This will be done by induction on k.\n\u2022 If k = 1, the result is obvious.\n\u2022 To prove the result for k, we have to show that along the chain between\nD and D \u2032 , the shape of the k-th column has changed as many times by\nappearance of a white x-column as by appearance of a white y-column\n(i.e., sum of d equal to zero) and as many times by disappearance of a\ncrossed x-column as by disappearance of a crossed y-column (i.e., sum\nof d\u2032 equal to zero).\nWe suppose that our column (assume it is a y-column in D and D \u2032 )\nchanges more times by appearance of a white x-column than by appearance of a white y-column. Let us observe the subchain on the figure\nbelow:\n\n1\n\nd1 , d'1\n2\n\nd2 , d'2\n\n3\n\nd3 , d'3\n\n4\n18\n\n\fLet h1 denote the height of the y-column of drawing 1 and h\u20321 the depth\nof the first x-column on its right. We observe that b4 = d3 \u2265 0 (Case 2\nof the Characterization) and that d2 = h\u20321 \u2212d1 \u2212d\u20321 since b3 = 0 = b2 \u2212d2\n(Case 1). Thus: d1 + d2 = h\u20321 \u2212 d\u20321 .\nWe now visualize the changes of shape at place k between D and D \u2032\non the following representation.\n\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\n\nThe even coordinates correspond to a y-column at place k, the odd ones\nto an x-column. A north-east line is either the appearance of a white\nx-column or disappearance of a crossed x-column (according to odd or\neven coordinate) and a south-east line is either the appearance of a\nwhite y-column or disappearance of a crossed y-column. The vertical\ndotted lines are defined as follows. The first is placed at the last point\nfor which the coordinate is equal to zero. Then we have clearly two\nnorth-east lines and we put another dotted line. Then we restart with\ntaking coordinate 2 as a new zero for the coordinates.\nLet us suppose that between D and D \u2032 there is a single ascent (i.e.,\na subchain like 1-2-3-4). If we verify that d0 + d1P\n+ d2 > 0, where d0\nis the sum of the d before the ascent, then since\nd = 0 between D\nand D \u2032 , we have necesseraly some d < 0 after this sequence, which is\nimpossible without a disappearance of the crossed y-column. That is\nwhat we wanted to show.\nLet us prove that d0 + d1 + d2 > 0.\nLet b denote the number of white cells at place k of D then b1 = b + d0 .\n19\n\n\fHence:\nd0 + d1 + d2 = d0 + h\u20321 \u2212 d\u20321 = b1 \u2212 b + h\u20321 \u2212 d\u20321 = h1 + h\u20321 \u2212 b.\nIt is easy to check that h1 + h\u20321 \u2212 b > 0.\nIt remains to observe that when there are several ascents, the previous\nreasoning is still true, by looking at the last one. Indeed, it suffices\nto replace the equality b1 = b + d0 by b1 \u2264 b + d0 (thanks to what\nprecedes), which keeps the result unchanged.\nThe proof of Lemma 3 is almost complete. It remains to observe that the\nsymmetries between x and y and between crossed and white cells allow us to\ndeal with the other cases.\n\u0003\nLemma 5 :\nIf there is no total completeness along the chain between D and D \u2032 , then\nD 6= D \u2032 which implies Theorem 3.\nProof. This is an easy consequence of Lemmas 2 and 4 and Remark 2. It\nsuffices to look at the leftmost place for which the completeness fails: D \u2032 has\nmore white cells (and less crosses) than D at this place.\n\u0003\n\n4.4\n\nEnd of the proof\n\nIt is now sufficient to show that there is at least one generation between D\nand D \u2032 that is not complete. We shall in fact show that each generation is\nnot complete.\nLet again D1 = (S1 , T1 ) and D2 = (S2 , T2 ) denote two different drawings,\nfather and son.\nIf D1 and D2 have the same shape, the result is obvious.\nIt then remains to study the case where D1 and D2 have different shape.\nWe suppose that completeness holds and reduce it to the absurd.\nBy looking at the place at most on the left where the shape changes,\nwe can consider only the case where the shape changes at place 1. The\nonly changes for which the non-completeness is not obvious are the following\n(remark that here d = d\u2032 = 0):\n20\n\n\fcase 1\n\ncase 2\n\ncase 3\n\ncase 4\n\nThe following remark allows us to divide by two the number of cases:\nRemark 4: D2 is a son of D1 if and only if flip(D1 ) is a son of flip(D2 ).\nThis allows us to only consider cases 2 and 4.\n\n21\n\n\f1. Case 2 :\n\na\n\nD1=\n\nD2=\n\nIf at place \"a\"(corresponding to the first plain crossed x-column in D2 ),\nthere is\n\u2022 an x-column: we first verify that at each place on the left of \"a\"\nwe have d = 0; then we show that the x-column in D1 is smaller\nthan the one in D2 , which contradicts b2 = b1 \u2212 d = b1 .\n\u2022 a y-column: we first show that in each x-column of T1 + S2 there\nis at least one cell coming from D1 and one coming from D2 . This\nis absurd since there are not enough x-columns.\n\n22\n\n\f2. Case 4:\n\nD1=\n\nD2=\n\nIn this case, if the first plain x-column of D1 is the l-th x-column of\nD1 , we begin by observing that the x-column on its left have at least\none white cell, hence have a contribution to T1 + S2 . Thus on the left\nof this place there is already an x-column of depth L \u2212 l + 1 (there are\nat least l x-columns in T1 + S2 on the left). This is absurd.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nElements of 0 x-degree\nDescription\n\nLet \u03bc = (\u03bc1 \u2265 \u03bc2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bck > 0) be any partition of n. The goal of this\nsection is to give an explicit basis for M\u03bc0 , which denotes the homogeneous\nsubspace of M\u03bc of elements of 0 x-degree. We construct this basis with the\nsame visual objects as in the case of hooks. We also obtain a basis for the\nn(\u03bc)\nsubspace of n(\u03bc) x-degree which we shall denote by M\u03bc .\nThe space M\u03bc0 has already been studied in [2] and [6]. In particular it\nis proved that its dimension is n!/\u03bc\u2032 !, where \u03bc! = \u03bc1 ! . . . \u03bck ! and \u03bc\u2032 is the\nconjugate of \u03bc. In fact our basis is related to a family introduced in [2]. But\nwe obtain here a direct (and not recursive) method of construction. Moreover\nwe apply the monomial derivatives to \u2206\u03bc itself and therefore obtain a simple\nand explicit basis for M\u03bc0 .\n23\n\n\fWe use again the drawings introduced for hook-shaped partitions, here\nin the case of any partition of n. A shape is then made of n \u2212 1 bars. Each\nof these bars has nx x-cells and ny y-cells. The set of pairs (nx , ny ) is the set\nof biexponents of the partition (the biexponent is omitted). We again put\ncrosses in the shapes and the set of rules for these drawings is the following:\n1. the bars with the same number of x-cells are arranged in decreasing\nheight;\n2. there are crosses in every x-cell;\n3. if a bar B is on the left of a bar with more x-cells than B and q y-cells,\nthen the bar B must have at least q + 1 y-white cells.\nRemark 5: By applying flip we obtain a family of drawings with no\nx-crosses.\nWe now give an example of a drawing:\n\nassociated to the partition:\n\n24\n\n\f5.2\n\nEnumeration\n\nWe verify that the number of drawings introduced in subsection 1 is n!/\u03bc!.\nWe consider the drawing from the left to the right. The bar we are looking\nat corresponds to a corner of the Ferrers diagram of the partition from which\nwe have removed the cells corresponding to the bars on the left.\nNumber the cells of the partition \u03bc by writing i in the cell associated to\nthe bar at place n \u2212 i + 1 in the drawing. By the preceding paragraph, this\ngives a standard tableau.\nWe now look at the following figures:\ni\nx\ni\n\nx\n\nWe observe that the number of choices for cell i is the length of the arrow\nthat we denote by coarm\u2217i (T i+1 ), where T i+1 is the (standard) tableau T from\nwhich we have removed the cells numbered from i + 1 to n.\nWe thus obtain that the cardinality is:\nX\n\n(1)\n\n1\nY\n\ncoarm\u2217i (T i+1 ).\n\nT standard i=n\n\nWe show that this number equals n!/\u03bc\u2032 ! by induction on n. The result\nis obvious when n = 1. We write \u03bc\u2032 = (c\u03b11 1 , . . . , c\u03b1h h ), where the cj 's are\nthe height of columns of \u03bc and \u03b1j their multiplicities. In particular, \u03bc has\nP\nQ\nh corners, \u03bc\u2032 ! = hi=j (cj !)\u03b1j , n = hj=1 \u03b1j cj and \u03b1j is the contribution of\ncorner j in the product of (1). We then rewrite this formula as:\nh\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b1j .\n\n1\nX Y\n\ncoarm\u2217i (T \u2032i+1 )\n\nT \u2032 i=n\u22121\n\nwhere T \u2032 varies amongst every standard tableaux of the Ferrers diagram\nfrom which we have removed its j-th corner (let \u03bcj denote the corresponding\n25\n\n\fpartition). We are now able to conclude, since \u03bc\u2032j ! = \u03bc\u2032 !/cj :\nh\nX\nj=1\n\n5.3\n\nh\n\n\u03b1j\n\n(n \u2212 1)!\nn!\n(n \u2212 1)! X\n\u03b1\n.c\n=\n=\n.\nj\nj\n\u03bc\u2032j !\n\u03bc\u2032 ! j=1\n\u03bc\u2032 !\n\nIndependence and conclusion\n\nAs in the case of the hook-shaped partitions, we denote by S (respectively\nT ) the diagram consisting only of the crosses (respectively of the white cells)\nof a given drawing. For example in the case of the drawing of subsection 5.1,\nwe have:\n\nS=\n\nT=\nLet now \u2202S and \u2202T denote the derivative operators associated to S and T .\nLet also S and T denote the set of all S's and T 's constructed by this way.\nWe also associate to S and T a monomial by the same way. For example,\nin the case of the previous figures, we have: MS = x2 y2 x43 x34 x6 x27 x8 and\nMT = y13 y2 y52 y6 y9 .\nTheorem 4:\nThe set {\u2202S \u2206\u03bc }S\u2208S is linearly independent and hence is a basis of M\u03bc0 .\nn(\u03bc)\nThe set {\u2202T \u2206\u03bc }T \u2208T is linearly independent and hence is a basis of M\u03bc .\nThe theorem is a consequence of the two following lemmas.\nLemma 6:\nWe can reconstruct the drawing from S or T .\n\n26\n\n\fLemma 7:\nFor the lexicographic order (x1 < x2 < * * * < xn < y1 < * * * < yn ) MT is\nthe minimal monomial for \u2202S \u2206\u03bc and MS for \u2202T \u2206\u03bc .\nProof. The proof of Lemma 6 is easy: we reconstruct the drawing from\nthe left to the right, as in the case of hooks, thanks to the rules.\nThe proof of Lemma 7 requires attention only in the case of T , so we\ndevelop this point. Once the crossed cells have been fixed, we have to show\nthat the white cells are at most on the left. It suffices in fact to show that\nthe x-white cells can not be moved to the left. We show it by looking at\nthe drawing from the left to the right. Let k and l denote the number of\nx-cells and of y-crossed cells at place p. We have to prove that a bar with\nl\u2032 > l x-cells and k \u2032 \u2265 k y-crossed cells is forbidden at place p. If the couple\n(k \u2032 , l\u2032 ) is not a biexponent of the partition or if it is present on the left, we\nare done. To conclude we observe that this couple can not be a biexponent of\nthe partition appearing on the right of the initial drawing. Indeed, because\nof the rules we should have: k > k \u2032 .\n\u0003\nRemark 6: It is possible to show that our family of monomials {MS }S\u2208S\nis equal to the family B\u03bc of [2], section 4. But whereas B\u03bc was constructed\nrecursively, our construction is direct. Moreover we apply it directly to \u2206\u03bc\nn(\u03bc)\nand obtain simple and explicit bases for M\u03bc0 and M\u03bc , whereas N. Bergeron\nand A. Garsia were dealing in [2] with linear translates of Garnir polynomials.\n\n6\n\nReferences\n1. E.
