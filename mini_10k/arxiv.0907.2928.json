By regulating the\nvarious parameters of the standing wave laser fields that create\nthe optical potentials, such as the laser power and wave length,\nmany theoretical models in the condensed matter physics can\nbe realized experimentally, especially those for the strongly\ncorrelated many body systems.1 In particular, bosons in a lattice have been widely studied in theory and experiment. The\ninvestigation of the correlated bosons can be traced back to\nthe study of 4 He.2 Recently D. Jaksch has pointed out that\nthe Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) Eq.(1) can well describe the\nultracold boson atoms in an optical lattice, if one assumes a\nshort-range pseudo potential interaction between the atoms\nand that the Wannier functions are well localized on the lattice\nsite.3,4\nThe BHM has been studied using various analytical and numerical methods. In their seminal paper, M. P. A. Fisher et\nal. used field theoretical approach to investigate the ground\nstate of this model and obtained the superfluid (SF)-Mott insulator (MI) transition on the mean field level.5 The Mott insulator is an incompressible state where integer number of\nbosons are localized on each site, while the superfluid phase\nis compressible and has nonlocal boson wave functions. As\nan interesting phase, the ground state of MI is considered\nas a good candidate to realize the qubits for quantum information processing.1,6,7 For weakly interacting bosons for\nwhich the fluctuations around the mean-field state are small,\nthe Bogolubov theory or the Gross-Pitaevskii equation applies\nbut both fail to predict the SF-MI transition.8,9 Beyond the\nmean field level, methods that can tackle the strong correlations have been applied3,5,9,10,11,12 , including the Gutzwiller\napproach13,14 , Bethe ansatz15 , time-dependent variational\nprinciple method16, slave boson approach17,18,19 , the strong\ncoupling expansion20,21,22,23 , variational method based on\nmean field theory24, and the effective action approach24,25 ,\netc. Recently the cavity method based on the Bethe lattice is\nalso applied to BHM26 . The numerical tools such as quantum\nMonte Carlo27,28,29,30,31,32,33 and density matrix renormalization group34,35 are used frequently for the unbiased studies.\n\nThe physics of the BHM depends critically on its spatial dimension. For a one dimensional system, the Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem36 excludes the possibility of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) at finite temperatures. In the strong interaction\nregime, the bosons behave as the Tonks-Girardeau gas whose\nproperties are similar to the noninteracting fermions.4,37,38\nThe BEC in two dimensions can be viewed as a quasicondensate, and the Mott transition is of the KosterlitzThouless type.4 The MI is strictly defined at zero temperature and the MI-BEC transition is a quantum transition well\ndefined at zero temperature. However, there is a finite temperature range where the occupation is fixed at an integer. As\ntemperature increases, the system changes from this Mott-like\nregime into the normal phase through a smooth crossover. For\nD > 2, the SF phase also transits into the normal phase at a\nfinite critical temperature.27,39\nExperimentally, the BHM has been realized in the system\nof alkali metal atoms in an optical lattice. The SF to MI transition has been observed in 1D, 2D and 3D, by changing the\ndepth of the optical lattices.40,41,42 These studies focused on\nthe MI and the SF phase mainly in 2D and 3D39,41,43,44,45 at\nfinite temperatures. The temperature in these studies is a key\nfactor and its effects on the observation cannot be ignored. Recent studies show that due to the finite temperature effects, the\nsharp peaks in the momentum distribution commonly adopted\nto identify the SF cannot be used as a reliable signature.27,46,47\nDue to technical difficulties, accurate studies for high dimensional system (D > 2) at finite temperatures that match the\nexperiments are still highly desirable.\nHere, we are interested in the strongly correlated bosons\non a high dimensional lattice (D > 2) at finite temperatures, which received less attention in previous theoretical\nstudies. One suitable method for our purpose is the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). DMFT is an exact theory in\ninfinite spatial dimensions.48 As an approximation for finite\ndimensional systems, it has been widely used in the study\nof strongly correlated fermion systems and received much\nsuccess.49 In a recent work, K. Byczuk and D. Vollhardt extended the idea of DMFT to correlated boson systems and applied it to the bosonic Falicov-Kimball model.50 In their theory, instead of the usual way of scaling the hopping amplitude\nin the fermionic DMFT, they used a different scaling ansatz\n\n\f2\nfor bosons: scaling ti j \u2212\u2192 t \u0303i j /z|i\u2212 j| for terms containing\n\u221a the\nanomalous averages hbi or hb\u2020 i, and scaling ti j \u2212\u2192 t \u0303i j / z|i\u2212 j|\nfor others. Such a new scaling is used to guarantee that the\nenergy density is finite as the spatial dimension goes to infinity, even if anomalous averages are involved in the boson\nsystems. It should be noted that the derivation of the above\nB-DMFT equations is not unique. Recently, the essentially\nidentical equations are also obtained by using an uniform\nscaling of t \u2192 t \u0303/z and keeping up to the subleading order\nin the 1/z expansion.51 In this paper, we apply B-DMFT to\nthe BHM. The resulting effective bosonic impurity model is\nsolved by exact diagonalization (ED) method50,52 . Results are\npresented for various phases at finite temperatures and compared to other theories and the experiments.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly introduce the single band Bose Hubbard model. We present the\nB-DMFT equations for the BHM, detail the impurity solver\nthat we use, and give tests and benchmarks. In Sec. III, the\nmain results of B-DMFT are shown and discussed. Sec. IV is\na conclusion. We put some technical details in Appendices.\n\nII.\n\nBose Hubbard Model\n\nThe single band BHM is defined by the Hamiltonian below\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\nti j b\u2020i b j\n\nhi, ji\n\nX\nUX\nni (ni \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bc\nni ,\n+\n2 i\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere b\u2020i and bi are the boson creation and annihilation operators on site i, respectively. They obey the commutation\nrelation [bi , b\u2020j ] = \u03b4i, j . ni = b\u2020i bi is the boson number operator\non the site i. Here, we consider the hopping amplitude ti j = t\nwhich is nonzero only for the nearest neighbors and U is the\non-site energy. Feshbach resonances can be used to change\nthe interaction strength over a wide range, even from repulsive to attractive.4 In this paper we study the repulsive BHM\nwith U \u2265 0. We add the chemical potential \u03bc which controls\nthe number of bosons in the grand canonical ensemble. For\nsimplicity, we take the density of states of the Bethe lattice,\nwhich is semicircular in the limit of infinite coordinations,\nD(\u01eb) =\n\n1 \u221a 2\n4t \u2212 \u01eb 2 , (|\u01eb| \u2264 2t).\n2\u03c0t2\n\nG(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) \u2261 \u2212hT \u03c4 [b(\u03c4)b\u2020 (\u03c4\u2032 )]i\n\n\u2212hT \u03c4 [b(\u03c4)b\u2020 (\u03c4\u2032 )]i \u2212hT \u03c4 [b(\u03c4)b(\u03c4\u2032)]i\n\u2212hT \u03c4 [b\u2020 (\u03c4)b\u2020 (\u03c4\u2032 )]i \u2212hT \u03c4 [b\u2020 (\u03c4)b(\u03c4\u2032 )]i\n!\nG1 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) G2 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 )\n=\n.\nG3 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) G4 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 )\n\n=\n\n(2)\n\nB. B-DMFT Equations\n\nIn DMFT, a lattice model is mapped into a single impurity problem with the self-consistently determined bath spectra. It becomes exact when the spatial dimension is infinite\nand hence ignores the spatial fluctuations from the outset.\nHowever, it fully takes into account the temporal fluctuations\n(imaginary time).49 The key ingredient to extend the DMFT to\nbosons is a proper scaling of the hopping amplitude of bosons\nin the limit of infinite dimensions.50\n\n!\n\n(3)\n\nAccording to the definition, the following relations hold for\nthe components G3 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) = G\u22172 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) and G4 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) =\nG\u22171 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ).\nThe action for the effective impurity model obtained\nthrough the cavity method49 reads,\nS ef f\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nA.\n\nWe adopt the ansatz of scaling in Ref. 50 and implement similar derivations for the BHM. The detail of derivations can be found in Ref. 50. Here we present only the\nfinal B-DMFT equations. For simplicity, here we use the\n53\nNambu\nrepresentation\nfor the boson operators b\u2020 (\u03c4) \u2261\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\nb (\u03c4) b(\u03c4) , and for the on-site interacting Green's functions (GFs) as in Ref. 50\n\nh\ni\nR\u03b2 R\u03b2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= 0 d\u03c4 0 d\u03c4\u2032 b\u20200 (\u03c4) \u2212G\u22121\n0 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 ) b0 (\u03c4 )\nR\u03b2\nR\u03b2\n+ 0 d\u03c4 U2 n0 (\u03c4)[n0 (\u03c4) \u2212 1] + 0 d\u03c4\u03a6\u20200 b0 (\u03c4).\n\nIn this equation, \u03a60 is related to the condensation via\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a6\u20200 = \u2212t \u0303hb\u20200 iS e f f \u2212t \u0303hb0 iS e f f .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nHere t \u0303 is the hopping amplitude after the scaling has been carried out. hb\u20200 i is treated as a \u03c4-independent quantity since we\nare studying an equilibrium theory. The Weiss field G\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n )\nrepresents the effective field from the environmental fluctuations acting on the impurity site.\nThe self energy is defined through the Dyson equation\n\u22121\n\u03a3(i\u03c9n ) = 2G\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n ) \u2212 Gc (i\u03c9n ).\n\n(6)\n\nHere, Gc is the connected GF defined as\nGc (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) = G(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) \u2212 Gdis (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Gdis (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u2032 ) is the disconnected part. Its fourier transform is given in Appendix C. In the imaginary time axis it is\na constant and coincides with the condensed fraction in the\nthermal dynamical limit. \u03a3 and G0 have the same symmetry\nproperties as the GF. Among the four matrix elements only\ntwo functions are independent. It is noted that the definition of the self-energy in Eq.(6) has a factor of 2 difference\nfrom Eq.(11) in Ref. 50. This difference can be traced back\nto the different conventions used for path integrals in Nambu\nrepresentation.54 We have checked that our equations are selfconsistent and they guarantee \u03a3(i\u03c9n ) = 0 for U = 0.\nThe connected local GF of the lattice Hamiltonian is given\nby the lattice Dyson equation\nGc (i\u03c9n ) =\n\ni\u22121\n1 X h (0) \u22121\n[Gc ] (k, i\u03c9n ) \u2212 \u03a3(i\u03c9n ) .\nNlatt k\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nHere Nlatt is the total lattice number.

The explicit integral\nformulas involving the semicircular density of states Eq.(A2)\nare summarized in Appendix A. Eq.(3)-Eq.(9) constitute the\nB-DMFT self-consistency equations for the BHM.\n\nand\n\u03a60 = \u2212t \u0303hb0 i.\n\n(13)\n\nHere h...i represents the average under Himp . G is calculated\nfrom the Lehmann representation. Gdis (i\u03c9n ) is the disconnected Green's function. Details are in Appendix C.\nUsing Eq.(6), one obtains the self-energy \u03a3 from Gc . It is\nthen put into the lattice Dyson equation Eq.(8) to produce a\nnew Gc . Using Eq.(6) again, we update the Weiss field G0\nand from it we get the new parameters Ek and Vk through the\nfollowing fitting procedure.49 A distance function D [Ek , Vk ]\nis defined as\n\nC. Impurity Solver\n\nIn order to solve the B-DMFT equations, a suitable impurity solver should be selected. To avoid technical complexities\nwe use the exact diagonalization method to solve the impurity\nmodel. It is simple, fast, while at the same time qualitatively\nkeeps the nontrivial many-body physics of the problem55. The\neffective impurity Hamiltonian equivalent to the action Eq.(4)\nreads\nHimp =\n\nBs\nX\nk=1\n\na\u2020k Ek ak +\n\nBs\nX\n\n(a\u2020k Vk b0 + b\u20200 V\u2020k ak )\n\nk=1\n\nU\n+ n0 (n0 \u2212 1) + \u03a6\u20200 b0 .\n2\n\n(10)\n\nThe creation and annihilation operators a\u2020k and ak are for the\nenvironmental degrees of freedom and are all in the Nambu\nrepresentation. B s is the number of bath sites. Ek and Vk\nare the kinetic energy of environmental bosons and the coupling strength between the environment and the impurity,\n! reEk1 Ek2\nand\nspectively. They are 2 \u00d7 2 matrices, Ek =\nEk3 Ek4\n!\nVk1 Vk2\n\u2020\nVk =\n. From the Hermiticity of Himp = Himp\n,\nVk3 Vk4\n\u2217\n\u2217\nwe have Ek4 = Ek1 being real, Ek3 = Ek2\n, Vk3 = Vk2\nand\n\u2217\nVk4 = Vk1 . The requirement that Himp is equivalent to the effective action S e f f in Eq.(4) gives the following relation (see\nAppendix B) between G\u22121\n0 and Ek , Vk ,\nG\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n )\n\uf8ee\n!\u22121 \uf8f9\uf8fa\nBs\nX\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef 1\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n1\n1\n= \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 i\u03c9n \u03c33 + \u03bcI \u2212\nVk i\u03c9n \u03c33 \u2212 Ek V\u2020k \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb .\n2\n2\n2\nk=1\n\n(11)\n\nWe solve the B-DMFT equations using an iterative scheme\nas usually done for fermions. We start from an initialization\nof the parameters Ek , Vk (k = 1, .., B s) and \u03a60 . With them\nwe calculate G\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n ) and define the impurity model Eq.(10).\nThe impurity Hamiltonian is then solved by ED to produce the\nconnected GF Gc and a new \u03a60 , according to the following\nequation,\nGc (i\u03c9n ) = G(i\u03c9n ) \u2212 Gdis (i\u03c9n ),\n\n(12)\n\nD [Ek , Vk ]\n\u0015\nX\u0014\n\u22121\ne\u22121\ne\u22121\nG\u22121\n=\n01 (i\u03c9n ) \u2212 G01 (i\u03c9n ) + G02 (i\u03c9n ) \u2212 G02 (i\u03c9n ) .\nn\n\n(14)\n\ne\u22121 is calculated from Ek and Vk through Eq.(11).\nHere G\n0\nD [Ek , Vk ] is then minimized with respect to Ek and Vk to find\nthe optimal parameters that can reproduce G\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n ) best. With\nthese optimal parameters we define a new impurity model to\nbe diagonalized again. The iteration continues until the lattice\nGF converges.\nOne specialty of boson is that it has an infinitely large local\nHilbert space. This poses difficulty for ED-based numerical\nmethods when adapted for bosons.56 In our ED calculations,\nwe truncate the local Hilbert space by using N +1 boson states\nfor each mode, with N a finite number. As the simplest algorithm, we use the boson number eigen state |ni (n = 0, 1, ..., N)\nas our local basis, and keep the implementation of optimal\nbasis for a future improvement.57 The truncation of boson\nHilbert space introduces additional approximation and influences the accuracy of our results, especially in the BEC phase\n(see below). It is therefore important to check our results with\nrespect to N and to make sure that the truncation errors are\nunder control.\nHowever, the truncation described above introduces a new\nproblem to the commutation relation of boson operators. In\nthe truncated Hilbert space, one has\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\nb = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n1 \u221a0 * * *\n0 2 ***\n0 0 ***\n.. ..\n. . ***\n0 0 ***\n0 0 ***\n\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n0\n..\n\u221a.\n0 N\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n(15)\n\nand b\u2020 is the hermitian conjugate matrix of b. From\nthese one gets bb\u2020 = diag{1, 2, ..., N, 0} and b\u2020 b =\ndiag{0, 1, ..., N \u2212 1, N}. The commutation relation reads\n[b, b\u2020] = diag{1, 1, ..., \u2212N} with the incorrect trace T r[b, b\u2020 ] =\n0. Therefore, using representation Eq.(15) in our calculation\nwill lead to incorrect weight in the GFs as well as in the density of states. This problem cannot be remedied by increasing\nN. To overcome this difficulty, we modify the representation\n\n\f4\nof b (b\u2020 accordingly) into\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nb = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n1 \u221a0\n0 2\n0 0\n.. ..\n. .\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n*** 0\n*** 0\n*** 0\n.\n* * * ..\n\n0\n0\n0\n..\n\u221a.\n*** 0 \u221a N\n*** 0 N +1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 .\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n(16)\n\nIt produces b\u2020 b = diag{0, 1, ..., N \u2212 1, 2N + 1}, and\u221a[bb\u2020 ]i,i = i\n(i = 1, ..., N + 1) and [bb\u2020 ]N,N+1 = [bb\u2020]N+1,N = N(N + 1).\nThe trace T r[b, b\u2020] = 0 is still incorrect. However, b\u2020 b from\nrepresentation Eq.(15) and bb\u2020 from Eq.(16), if combined together, give the correct trace T r[b, b\u2020 ] = N + 1 Therefore,\nour strategy is that for any operators involving b\u2020 b, such as\nhi|b\u2020 | jih j|b|ii in the Lehmann representation of the diagonal\nGF, we use Eq.(15). For operators involving bb\u2020 such as\nhi|b| jih j|b\u2020 |ii, we use Eq.(16) (see Eq.(C2) and (C3) in Appendix C). In this way, the truncation introduced boson commutation problem is solved.\nFor the bosonic impurity model Eq.(10) with B s bath sites\nand N + 1 states for each boson mode, the dimension of the\nHilbert space is S t = (N + 1)Bs+1 . To describe the BEC phase\nwhere \u03a60 , 0, the total particle number can no longer be\nused as a good quantum number. In this case both ED and\ncalculating the GFs are very time consuming. As a result,\nthe parameters N and B s are severely limited by the present\ncomputer power. In the DMFT (ED) study of the Fermi Hubbard model with four states on each site, it was shown that\nresults converge quite fast with the bath site number B s , and\nB s = 4 already gives qualitatively reliable results.49 To explore the B s and N dependence of calculations for the Bose\n\nHubbard model, we calculate the Ntot \u2212 \u03bc curves in both the\natomic and the free boson limit for different N and B s values.\nThe results are shown in Fig.1. In both limits, as long as the\nbath site number B s is larger than zero, the results are already\nvery close to the exact ones. At the same time, N-dependence\nis more severe. The curves keep improving observably until\nN \u2265 10. Taking a compromise between N and B s , in our study\nwe do all the calculations at B s = 1 (one bath site) and N = 15\n(16 boson states) unless stated otherwise. We check our results using larger N and B s and make sure that our conclusion\ndoes not depend on the selection of B s and N. For the Matsubara frequencies \u03c9n = 2n\u03c0/\u03b2 in the GFs, we use the cut off\n|\u03c9n | \u2264 2000.\nD. Non-Interacting Limit and Atomic Limit\n\nIn this section, we check the B-DMFT formulas and our\nnumerical results in the noninteracting as well as in the atomic\nlimit. For a noninteracting boson system, the bosons can move\nfreely in the lattices. They condense into a single particle state\nwhen the temperature is lower than T c . The exact solution\nof the Bose Hubbard model in this limit gives the thermally\nexcited boson occupation Ne as\nZ \u221e\nD(\u01eb)\nNe =\nd\u01eb \u03b2(\u01eb\u2212\u03bc)\n.\n(17)\ne\n\u22121\n\u2212\u221e\nThe B-DMFT equations Eq.(3)-Eq.(9) can also be solved exactly in this limit.50 At U = 0, by carrying out the Gaussian\nintegral in Eq.(4) and doing the functional derivative of the\nfree energy with respect to G\u22121\n0 (subtracting the disconnected\ncontribution), we get the connected GF as\nGc (i\u03c9n ) =\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\nN=4\n0.3\n\nNtot\n\nBs=0\nBs=1\nBs=2\nBs=3\n\n0\n2\n\n(b)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\nBs=1\n\n(d)\n\n0.3\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03bc\n\n30\n\nBs=1\nN=4\nN=7\nN=10\nN=15\nExact\n\n1\n\nN=1\nN=2\nN=4\nN=10\nN=15\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n60\n\n(18)\n\nwhich is independent of \u03a60 . This gives a zero self-energy\n\u03a3(i\u03c9n ) = 0 according to Eq.(6), as expected.

The expression\nEq.(17) for the thermal excited particle number Ne can be recovered from it using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nThe order parameter of BEC reads\nZ Y\n1\n\u2020\nhb0 i =\nDb\u2217i Dbi b\u20200 exp(\u2212S e f f )\nZ\ni\n(20)\n1 \u2020\n= \u03a60 G0 (i0).\n2\nTogether with Eq.(5), it gives\n(\n= 0,\n\u03bc < \u22122t \u0303, for normal phase,\n\u03a60 \u2020\n, 0,\n\u03bc = \u22122t \u0303, for BEC phase.\n\n(21)\n(21\u2032 )\n\nConsidering that for \u03bc = \u22122t \u0303, Gc (i0) = \u2212(1/t \u0303)I, we cannot\ndetermine the nonzero value of \u03a60 in the BEC phase solely\n\n\f5\nfrom the self-consistency equations. This corresponds to the\nfact that for free bosons, the condensed fraction cannot be\nfixed without giving the total particle number Ntot . The results above can also be obtained from the equation of motion\nof GFs, starting from the impurity Hamiltonian Eq.(10) with\nU = 0. From this approach one gets\n\nnumber of localized particles at zero temperature. As the temperature increases, thermal fluctuations dominate and the localized state will melt gradually. In this limit, \u03a60 = 0 according to Eq.(5). The density of states D(\u01eb) becomes a delta\nfunction, and Eq.(8) reduces to\n\u0002\n\u0003\nGc (i\u03c9n ) = i\u03c9n \u03c33 + \u03bcI \u2212 \u03a3(i\u03c9n ) \u22121 .\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\u22121\nX\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\u2020\n\u22121\nGc (i\u03c9n ) = \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0i\u03c9n \u03c33 + \u03bcI \u2212 4\nVk (i\u03c9n \u03c33 \u2212 2Ek ) Vk \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\n\n(24)\n\nComparing with Eq.(6), one gets G\u22121\n0 (i\u03c9n ) = (i\u03c9n \u03c33 + \u03bcI) /2.\nWhen inserted into the effective action Eq.(4), it gives ex-\n\nk\n\n(22)\n\nand\n\u2020\n\nhb0 i =\n\n\u03a6\u20200\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\u22121\nX\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\u2020\n\u22121\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u03bcI + 2\nVk Ek V \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb .\nk\n\nk\n\n(a)\n\n0.0001\n\nNe\n\n(a)\n\n0.1\n-3.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.0\n\n\u03bc\n\n(b)\n0.0\n\n(c)\n0.4\n\n2\n\nNtot\n\n(d)\n\nN=4\nN=7\nN=10\nN=15\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n1\nT=0.5\nT=2.0\nT=6.0\nT=10.0\n\n0.00000\n\n20\n\n\u03c9n\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n1.4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) DMFT result (dots with eye-guiding lines)\nand the exact result (solid line) for the thermal excited boson number\nNe at U = 0, t \u0303 = 1.0.

Note that in\nthe atomic limit, the B-DMFT results depend very weakly on\nB s and N. It is seen that the thermal activation will smear the\nMott plateaus and the compressibility \u2202Ntot /\u2202\u03bc has broadened\npeaks. For U = 50, the Mott plateaus are clear at low temperatures and their features disappear completely at about T = 10.\nThis observation agrees with the conclusion that the MI melts\ncompletely at about T \u2217 = 0.2U in the limit t \u0303 = 0.39\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this section we discuss the physical results obtained by\nthe B-DMFT for the BHM. At zero temperature, the system\nshould be either in the BEC phase for weak interaction or in\nthe MI phase for strong interaction. At finite temperatures,\nbesides the BEC and MI phases that are extended from the\nground state, there is the normal phase that is connected to\nthe MI and BEC phase in low temperature regimes, through a\ncrossover and a second-order phase transition, respectively.\nFig.5(a) and (b) show the diagonal component of the converged connected GFs typical for the BEC, MI, and normal\nphases. They are calculated at a finite but low temperature\nT/U = 0.05. All the high energy parts show the expected\nbehavior ReGc1 (i\u03c9n ) \u221d 1/\u03c92n and ImGc1 (i\u03c9n ) \u221d 1/\u03c9n . The\nlow energy behaviors are markedly different between the MI\nphase and the other two. Similar to the MI phase of fermions,\nImGc1 (i\u03c9n ) \u2192 0 at zero frequency, signaling strong scattering and nonexistence of well defined low energy quasiparticles in the MI phase. In contrast, in the BEC and the normal\nphases, the diagonal connected GFs are qualitatively similar.\n\n0.3\n\nRe(Gc)\n\nNtot = \u2212\n\n1X\n+\nGc1 (i\u03c9n )ei\u03c9n 0 + hb0 i2 ,\n\u03b2 n\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the condensed boson number N0 is\nN0 = hb0 i2 .\n\n(26)\n\nFor U > 0, a simple mean field analysis shows that the free\nenergy becomes a quartic function for large hb0 i and hence\nboth N0 and Ntot can be determined solely by the B-DMFT\nequations. They are plotted in Fig.6 as functions of the chemical potential. In Fig.6(a) we fix T/U = 0.05 and study the\nevolution of the curves as t \u0303/U decreases. For large t \u0303/U (small\nU for fixed t \u0303), Ntot and N0 are increasing functions of \u03bc up\nto a boundary of \u03bc and the system always stay in the BEC\nphase. At the boundary, the convergence becomes slow and\ndifficult. As t \u0303/U is smaller, a plateau of Ntot = 1 begins to\nemerge in the Ntot \u2212 \u03bc curve. N0 has a temporal decreases\nat the corresponding \u03bc and then continues to increase. The\nsystem is still in BEC phase, but the plateau and the dip in N0\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n-0.3\n\nIn Fig.5(c) and (d) are the corresponding off diagonal GFs in\nthe three phases. The condensation in the BEC phase contributes to a sharp peak in the low energy regime of ReGc2 .\nWhile in the MI and the normal phases, no such peak appears.\nIn all the three phases, ImGc2 = 0 as it is required by its definition and symmetry.\nThe full GF (not shown in Fig.5) can be written as the form\nGm (i\u03c9n ) = Gcm (i\u03c9n ) + \u2206m \u03b4n,0 , (m = 1, 2).

Symbols with eye-guiding lines are denoted\nin the figure.\n\n\f7\nshow the precursor to the MI phase. As t \u0303/U still decreases, the\nplateau enlarges at Ntot = 1 and the next one at Ntot = 2 begins\nto appear, forming Mott-like regimes. N0 has a well formed\ngap corresponding to each plateau, and has a peak signaling\nBEC between two neighboring gaps. These BEC phases appear around \u03bc = 0, U, 2U, ... where two adjacent Mott plateaus\nare connected. As t \u0303/U decreases, the height of the N0 peak\ndecreases and the critical temperature T c also decreases (see\nFig.8(b)). For very large U such as t \u0303/U = 0.02, BEC doesn't\nappear any more because the critical temperature is lower than\nthe actual T , (T/U)c < T/U = 0.05 at t \u0303/U = 0.02. Fig.6(c)\nshows the temperature evolution at a fixed t \u0303/U = 0.05. The\ntemperature effects on the Mott plateau as well as on the BEC\nphase are clearly observable. As temperature rises, the Mott\nplateaus gradually blur at the shoulders and the condensed boson number N0 reduces to zero. For high enough temperature,\nthe Mott plateaus finally disappear and the MI crosses over to\nthe normal phase.\nA recent B-DMFT study for the bosonic Falicov-Kimball\nmodel reveals that the local repulsion enhances the transition\ntemperature of BEC.50 Here we study the influence of U on\nBEC in the BHM. In Fig.7, we plot the N0 \u2212 T curves at different t \u0303/U values for a fixed total density Ntot = 1.5. For a\ngiven t \u0303/U, N0 is a decreasing function of T , and reduces to\nzero at T c . With decreasing t \u0303/U values (increasing U/t \u0303), the\nN0 \u2212 T curve shifts downwards, leading to smaller N0 for a\ngiven T and a reduction of T c . This is consistent with the\nnaive picture that strong local repulsion between bosons tends\nto suppress the particle number fluctuations and act against\nthe BEC. Also, the quasiparticle states into which the bosons\ncan condense are turned into incoherent states and shifted into\n\nthe Hubbard bands by a large U. Therefore, our conclusion\nis that, different from the bosonic Falicov-Kimball model, the\nlocal repulsion in the BHM reduces the transition temperature\nof BEC.\nDifferent phases in the system can be distinguished from\nNtot and N0 . At zero temperature, the system has two phases:\nthe BEC phase and the MI. Due to the competition between\nthe on-site repulsion U and the hopping t, there is a quantum phase transition between them. As temperature increases,\nthe BEC phase and the MI will change into normal phase\nthrough a phase transition and a crossover, respectively. We\nhave therefore three phases to identify at finite temperatures:\na nonzero N0 signals the BEC phase, while the MI has N0 = 0\nand an integer Ntot with zero compressibility \u2202Ntot /\u2202\u03bc; the\nphase with N0 = 0 but a finite compressibility is the normal\nphase. According to this criterion, we plot the phase diagrams\nin Fig.8.\nIn Fig.8(a) is the phase diagram on the \u03bc/U \u2212 t \u0303/U plane\nfor finite temperature T/U = 0.05. It is obtained by scanning\n\u03bc/U at fixed t \u0303/U. Three regimes are clearly shown, the MI\nphase, BEC and the normal phase. Due to the small N parameter that we use, only the Ntot = 1 and part of the Ntot = 2 MI\ndomains are obtained. In the large t \u0303/U regime, BEC is stable.\nBetween the two boundaries (circles and pentacles) is the normal phase. The melting temperature T \u2217 and BEC transition\ntemperature T c are marked by pentacles and circles, respectively. Similar finite temperature phase diagram is also obtainable from a static mean field theory12 . To understand the temperature effects on this diagram, we resort to phase diagrams\non the T/U \u2212 t \u0303/U plane at two different \u03bc/U values, Fig.8(b)\nand (c). At T = 0, a BEC-MI quantum phase transition occurs at a critical t \u0303/U. The difference between Fig.8(b) and (c)\nshows that (t \u0303/U)c is dependent on \u03bc/U, consistent with the\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\nT/U=0.05\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nN0\n\nBEC\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bc/U\n\nT/U\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc/U=0.5\nNormal\n\n0.2\n\nt/U\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\nMI\n\n0.0\n0.4\n\nBEC\n\nMI\n\n(c)\n\n0.3\n\nNormal\n\nBEC\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nT\n\n1.5\n\nNormal\n\n2.0\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) The condensed boson number N0 as functions\nof temperature T for fixed total number Ntot = 1.5 and different t \u0303/U\n(t \u0303 = 1.0).

At finite temperatures, the normal phase appears as a quantum critical regime\nextending from the T = 0 quantum critical point. This hints\nthat in the normal phase near (t \u0303/U)c , critical behavior such\nas power law correlation should exist. Experimental observation of such quantum critical features in the normal phase near\n(t/U)c will be an interesting issue.\nA representative quantity for comparison between different theories is the critical value (t/U)c at the tip of the the\nn = 1 Mott lobe. It has been obtained by various methods. For the 3D cubic lattice, the world line QMC gives\n(t/U)c = 0.032(Ref. 27) and the worm algorithm QMC gives\n(t/U)c = 0.03408 (Ref. 33). Recent studies for the Bethe\nlattice with z = 6 give (t/U)c = 0.033 (Ref. 26) and (t/U)c =\n0.032 (Ref. 51). In our study, we obtained (t \u0303/U)c = 0.12\nfor \u03bc/U = 0.5 (n=1 Mott lobe). The apparent discrepancy\nbetween our value and the previous ones is because we didn't\nuse the realistic lattice structure. In our calculations, we take\nz = \u221e literally and set t \u0303 = 1 as the energy unit, hence z doesn't\nappear explicitly. Since different scalings relating t \u0303 to t are\nused in B-DMFT for the normal and the condensed bosons, a\ncritical value for z = 6 cannot be simply recovered from our\nresult by doing an inverse scaling. A \u221acrude estimation, however, gives (t/U)c \u2248 0.12/z \u223c 0.12/ z = 0.02 \u223c 0.049 for\nz = 6, being consistent with the more accurate values.\nFor realistic lattices with a finite coordinate z, the B-DMFT\nis still applicable but should be regarded as an approximation to finite dimensional systems. For such a calculation,\none should use the actual dispersion \u01ebk of the given lattice\nin Eq.(9), and replace t \u0303 with zt in Eq.(5). Experimentally,\nthe BEC-MI transition point was observed for 87 Rb atoms in\n3D optical lattices.40 The transition occurs at a potential depth\nof 13Er which compares favorably with the mean-field value\nU/t = 5.8z,9,10,12 but differs from the more accurate QMC results cited above. The B-DMFT calculation for the BHM in\n3D cubic lattice and quantitative comparison with the experiments as well as with the previous theoretical results will be\nan interesting topic. But this is only attainable when an accurate impurity solver is available. Therefore we leave it for\nfuture study.\nFinally we note that the ED method used in this work poses\nlimitations to our study. Due to finite number of boson states\nN = 15, reliable calculations are only possible in the small\nNtot and small N0 regimes. The small number of bath sites\nB s = 1 causes slow convergence, especially near the MIBEC transition. Therefore, for practical applications of BDMFT to boson systems, it is necessary to develop an accurate\nand fast impurity solver. In this respect, the recently developed bosonic NRG is a promising technique.52,56 For the ED\n\nmethod, an algorithm adopting the optimal boson basis will\nbe interesting and progress is being made in this direction.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have performed the B-DMFT study for\nthe BHM. Following the ansatz of scaling in Ref. 50, we obtain the B-DMFT equations for the BHM. The bosonic effective impurity Hamiltonian is solved by ED method with\ntruncated boson Hilbert space. We focus on the finite temperature properties of the correlated bosons, and identify the\nMI, BEC and the normal phases. The repulsive U is found to\nsuppress the BEC transition temperature T c . Phase diagrams\non the \u03bc/U \u2212 t \u0303/U and T/U \u2212 t \u0303/U planes are obtained, which\ndisclose the quantum critical nature of the low temperature\nnormal phase. Relevance of our results to other theoretical\nones and the experimental observations are discussed.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Krzysztof Byczuk and Dieter Vollhardt for\nhelpful discussions and their comments on the manuscript.\nWe also thank Anna Kauch for pointing our an error in\nour formula.
