INTRODUCTION\n\nObservations of pulsed light emitted from the surface of a\nneutron star have the potential to constrain the star's mass, radius and equation of state. By modeling the physics of the\nemission region (such as the emissivity, shape and size) and\ntracing the paths of photons traveling through the relativistic\ngravitational field of the spinning neutron star to the observer,\nit is possible to create model pulse shapes which can be compared to the observed pulse shapes, allowing fits to the star's\nmacroscopic parameters to be made. The main problem in\nsuch a program is disentangling the effects arising from the\nneutron star's gravitational field and the effects coming from\nthe assumptions about the spectrum and geometry of the emission region. A further complication arises if the neutron star is\nrotating rapidly, since the effects of rotation can significantly\nalter the geodesic paths traveled by the photons from the simple Schwarzschild geodesics.\nRadio pulsars have most of their light emitted far from the\nneutron star, thus they are unlikely to be useful for constraining the neutron star's properties. However, accreting X-ray\npulsars, whose light is emitted from an accretion column close\nto the surface, provide a good probe of the strong gravitational field near the neutron star. Modeling of observed pulse\nshapes was first carried out without including gravitational effects using polar cap models of increasing complexity (Wang\n& Welter 1981; Leahy 1990, 1991). The later models were\nmotivated by radiative transfer calculations of the emissivity\nby caps and cylindrical columns by M\u00e9szaros & Nagel (1985).\nGravitational light-bending was early on realized to be important (Pechenick, Ftaclas, & Cohen 1983) and was included in\nmodel calculations of caps and columns by M\u00e9szaros & RifElectronic address: ccadeau@phys.ualberta.ca, leahy@iras.ucalgary.ca,\nmorsink@phys.ualberta.ca\n1 Theoretical Physics Institute, Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2J1, Canada\n2 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary\nAB, T2N 1N4, Canada\n\nfert (1988) and in fits of cap models to observed pulse profiles by Leahy & Li (1995). Accretion column models with\nlight-bending were computed by Kraus (2001), Leahy (2003)\nand Kraus et al. (2003). Analysis of the occultation sequence\nof the X-ray pulsar Her X-1 by Scott et al. (2000) gave the\nunique observational result that the pulse shape must be due\nto a pencil beam from the near pole and a gravitationallyfocused fan beam from the far pole. This resulted in a quantitative model for the pulse shape of Her X-1 (Leahy 2004)\nand a mass-to-radius constraint for the neutron star (Leahy\n2004b).\nFor the X-ray pulsars that have longer than millisecond periods, the rotation rates are so slow (the fastest is 69 ms, most\nare > 1 s) that it is not necessary to introduce any rotational\ncorrections at all. The first millisecond X-ray pulsar in a lowmass X-ray binary, SAX J1808.4-3658, was recently discovered by Wijnands & van der Klis (1998) and spins at a frequency of 400 Hz (Chakrabarty & Morgan 1998); this is fast\nenough that the rotational speeds at the equator must be relativistic. In addition, X-ray bursts from a number of rapidlyrotating neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries have been\nobserved to have phase lags between different energy bands\n(Cui, Morgan & Titarchuk 1998). These phase lags may have\ntheir origin in relativistic effects.\nA standard approximation scheme for ray-tracing near rotating neutron stars has been to treat the propagation of photons as though the gravitational field were static, so that\nthe Schwarzschild metric and the formalism presented by\nPechenick, Ftaclas, & Cohen (1983) can be used. The effects\nof rotation are brought into the problem by introducing special relativistic Doppler boosts as though the star had no gravitational field. We call this approximation \"Schwarzschild +\nDoppler\" (S+D). Recently the S+D approximation has been\nused by Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003) to fit the pulse profile\nof SAX J1808.4-3658 and to place constraints on the neutron\nstar's value of M/R.\nOne would expect that the S+D approximation is reasonable for slow rotation or for fast rotation with emission near\n\n\f2\nthe spin poles of the star. However, if emission occurs from a\nregion close to the equator of a rapidly-rotating neutron star, it\nis possible that this approximation scheme could break down.\nOne of the main goals of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy\nof this approximation by comparing against an exact treatment of photon propagation in the equatorial plane, where\nwe expect the largest errors to occur. To accomplish this, we\nconsider a simple model where the emitting region is a onedimensional curve that emits photons only into the equatorial\nplane. By considering a variety of calculation methods and\ntypes of emission for this one-dimensional test case, we can\nquantify the worst-case errors that can arise in applications\nusing approximate versions of the pulse shape calculation.\nThe effects of relativistic rotation on pulse shapes have been\nconsidered in a number of different treatments. The timing\nof pulses from millisecond pulsars in the polar cap model\nwhere emission comes from a radially-extended region near\nthe pulsar's surface was investigated using the metric for a\nslowly-rotating neutron star (Kapoor & Datta 1986), and the\nKerr black hole metric (Kapoor 1991). The lag of low energy photons during X-ray bursts was modeled by including special relativistic Doppler effects but ignoring all gravitational effects (Ford 1999). This work was later extended\nusing the S+D approximation in order to model the energydependent delays in SAX J1808.4-3658 (Ford 2000). The\noscillation amplitudes and energy phase lags during X-ray\nbursts on rapidly-rotating neutron stars have been investigated\nusing the S+D approximation without time-delays (Miller &\nLamb 1998; Weinberg, Miller & Lamb 2001) and with timedelays (Muno, \u00d6zel, & Chakrabarty 2002) and also using the\nSchwarzschild metric with neither Doppler effects nor time\ndelays (Nath, Strohmayer, & Swank 2002). Pulse shapes have\nalso been computed by using the rotating Kerr black hole metric to approximate the spacetime of a rotating neutron star\n(Chen & Shaham 1989; Braje, Romani, & Rauch 2000).\nIn this paper we are evaluating the accuracy of the S+D approximation against the exact calculation of a rapidly-rotating\nneutron star. In order to evaluate the largest extent of the errors, we are restricting our calculations to photons emitted\nfrom the equator which travel in the equatorial plane to the\nobserver. In Section 2 we outline the details of the calculation\nof pulse shapes for equatorial photons emitted by a rapidlyrotating neutron star. In Section 3 we briefly review the standard S+D approximation and compare its predictions against\nthose of Section 2 for a simple type of emission. In order to\nevaluate the importance of these differences, we compute the\neffects of different emission models on pulse shapes in Section 4. The effects of the approximation on the fitted neutron\nstar radius are shown in Section 5.\n2. PULSE SHAPES FOR RAPIDLY-ROTATING NEUTRON\nSTARS\n\nA two-dimensional area of a star emits light with frequency\n\u03bde , intensity I\u03bde in a direction which makes an angle of \u03b1e\nwith respect to the normal to the surface. An observer far\nfrom the star sees that the area subtends a solid angle d\u03a9o\nand the photons have an observed frequency \u03bdo . Defining the\nredshift z through the relation 1 + z = \u03bde /\u03bdo , and making use\nof the conservation of photon number density in phase space,\nthe observed flux is\nF\u03bdo = I\u03bdo d\u03a9o = I\u03bde\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1+z\n\n\u00133\n\nd\u03a9o .\n\n(1)\n\nIn order to construct a light curve if the area produced an instantaneous flash of light, we must take into account the fact\nthat the emitting surface is moving and that photons from different parts of the surface arrive at the detector at different\ntimes. In this section we describe how the observed angle\nsubtended by the emitting area and the times of arrival are\ncomputed, and light curves constructed.\nWe are interested in modeling light propagation on the\nbackground of a rapidly-rotating neutron star. Accurate models of rotating neutron stars for tabulated equations of state\ncan be computed numerically using the public-domain code\nrns3 (Stergioulas & Friedman 1995). This computer code\ncomputes the metric functions \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c1, and \u03c9 appearing in the\naxisymmetric, stationary metric\nds2 = \u2212e\u03b3+\u03c1 dt 2 + e\u03b3\u2212\u03c1 r\u03042 sin2 \u03b8(d\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c9dt)2 + e2\u03b1 (dr\u03042 + r\u03042 d\u03b82 ),\n(2)\nwhere the metric functions depend only on the coordinates\n\u03b8 and r\u0304. The metric function \u03c9 is the term responsible for the frame-dragging effect and would vanish if the\nstar weren't rotating. The coordinate r\u0304 corresponds to the\nisotropic Schwarzschild radial coordinate in the limit of zero\nrotation. The standard radial coordinate that appears in the\nSchwarzschild metric, r, is related to our coordinates by\nr = r\u0304 exp 12 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c1). In the limit of zero rotation, the following\ncombinations of metric functions are:\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n2M\n1\nlim e 2 (\u03b3+\u03c1) = 1 \u2212\n,\n(3)\n\u03a9\u22c6 \u21920\nr\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0012\n2M\n, and\n(4)\nlim r\u0304e\u2212\u03c1 = r 1 \u2212\n\u03a9\u22c6 \u21920\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2M\n\u03b1\u2212 12 (\u03b3+\u03c1)\nlim e\ndr\u0304 = 1 \u2212\ndr,\n(5)\n\u03a9\u22c6 \u21920\nr\nwhere \u03a9\u22c6 is the star's angular velocity, as measured by an\nobserver at infinity.\n2.1. Selection of Stellar Models\nWe have chosen four stellar models to illustrate the effects\ndiscussed in this paper. We have chosen equations of state\n(EOS) A and L from the Arnett & Bowers (1977) catalogue\nwhich span a realistic range of stiffness. EOS A is one of the\nsoftest equations of state and EOS L is one of the stiffest allowed by present observations. For each EOS, we have computed two 1.4M\u2299 models with spin frequencies 300 Hz and\n600 Hz, spanning the range of observed spin frequencies seen\nduring X-ray bursts. The parameters describing these models\nare given in Table 1. We have also chosen to designate Model\n4 (EOS L, 600 Hz) as our fiducial model against which all\napproximations will be made. We have selected this model\nsince it is both the fastest and largest model of the set, so we\nexpect that any effects due to relativistic velocities or long\nlight-crossing times will be maximized in this model.\nWe are interested in quantifying differences between the\nS+D approximation and the exact rotation calculation. In order to do so, we will refer to \"Schwarzschild Equivalent\" (SE)\nstars, which are spherically-symmetric stars with the same\nmass and equatorial radius as the models listed above. Note\nthat these SE stars have a larger radius than would be normally\ncomputed for a static star with the given EOS and mass.

Photon Paths in the Equatorial Plane\nIn this paper we restrict ourselves to photons emitted from\nthe equator in a direction in the equatorial plane. With this\nrestriction, the motion of a photon is specified once the initial\nlocation and impact parameter are specified. The geodesic\nequations describing the paths traced by outgoing photons\nare:\n\u0012 \u0013\ndt\n= e\u2212(\u03b3+\u03c1) (1 \u2212 \u03c9b),\n(8)\nd\u03bb\n\u0012 \u0013\nd\u03c6\nb\n= \u03c9e\u2212(\u03b3+\u03c1) (1 \u2212 \u03c9b) + 2 e\u03c1\u2212\u03b3 , and\n(9)\nd\u03bb\nr\u0304\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u00131/2\n2\ndr\u0304\n2 b 2\u03c1\n\u2212\u03b1\u2212 12 (\u03b3+\u03c1)\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9b) \u2212 2 e\n=e\n,\n(10)\nd\u03bb\nr\u0304\nwhere b is the photon's impact parameter and \u03bb is an affine\nparameter defined so that photon orbits are independent of\nenergy. We are considering photons originating on the equatorial plane (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2) emitted parallel to the equatorial plane\n(u\u03b8 = 0 initially). It is a straightforward calculation to show\nthat such photons must remain in the equatorial plane, i.e.,\nd\u03b8/d\u03bb = 0.\nSince the radial component of the four-velocity must be\nreal, the impact parameters must lie in the range bmin \u2264 b \u2264\nbmax , where the minimum and maximum impact parameters\nare:\n1\n, and\n(11)\nbmin = \u2212r\u0304e\u2212\u03c1\n1 \u2212 \u03c9r\u0304e\u2212\u03c1\n1\n,\n(12)\nbmax = r\u0304e\u2212\u03c1\n1 + \u03c9r\u0304e\u2212\u03c1\n\nwhere the metric potentials are to be evaluated at the point at\nwhich the null ray originates, e.g., the surface of the star. The\nframe-dragging term is positive, so the effect of rotation is that\n|bmin | > |bmax |. As a result, rotation allows an observer to see\nmore of the side of the star which is moving away from the\nobserver, as shown in Figure 1. In this figure, bS corresponds\nto the maximum value of the impact parameter allowed for a\nstatic star.\n2.3. Deflection of Photons\nIn Figure 1 we illustrate the deflection of photons from the\npoint of emission on the star to the observer. We define the\nazimuthal location of the distant observer to be at \u03c6 = 0. A\nphoton with impact parameter b hits the observer if it was\nemitted at azimuthal angle \u03c6i . The initial emission location is\nfound by dividing Equation 9 by Equation 10, and integrating\nfrom the star's surface to the distant observer:\nZ \u221e\n\u03c9(1 \u2212 \u03c9b) + be2\u03c1/r\u03042\n1\ne\u03b1\u2212 2 (\u03b3+\u03c1)\n\u2212\u03c6i (b) =\n\u00011/2 dr\u0304. (13)\nr\u0304e\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9b)2 \u2212 b2 e2\u03c1 /r\u03042\nThe deflection angle \u03c8 is defined by \u03c8 = \u2212\u03c6i . In the calculation of flux from a star, both the quantities \u03c8(b) and d\u03c8/db\nare of importance. These quantities are plotted for the fiducial\nstellar model in Figure 2. In addition, we show the deflections for the SE static model. The differences between the\ncalculations with and without rotation are very small. The\nworst errors occur at the limbs of the star, so these differences\nare only likely to be of importance if the light is preferentially\nemitted in directions close to the horizontal.\n2.4. Times of Arrival\nTo accurately model pulse shapes, we account for the different amounts of coordinate time that photons emitted from\ndifferent regions of the star will take to reach the observer.\nOnce the times of arrival (TOA) are known, the photons can\nbe placed into the correct detector timing bins. The choice of\nzero time is arbitrary, so we have chosen a value of zero TOA\nfor a photon with zero impact parameter. For photons emitted with the maximal values of impact parameter, the TOA is\nsimilar to the light travel time across the star. For our fiducial\nstellar model with R = 16.38 km, the light travel time is close\nto 80 \u03bcs. Compared to a spin period of 1.6 ms, this corresponds to a 5% effect, which will be seen to have a significant\neffect on the calculated pulse shapes.\nThe TOA is calculated by dividing Equation 8 by Equation 10, integrating from the star's surface to the distant observer and then subtracting off the corresponding quantity for\n\n\f4\nb+\n\n11111\n00000\n\u03b1+\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n\u03c6 i11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n\u03c6+\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n\u2206\u03c6\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n\n\u2212bs\nbmin\n\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\nd\u03b5\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n00\n11\n000000000000000000\n111111111111111111\n00000000000000000\n11111111111111111\n00\n11\nobserver\n\nb\u2212\n\n\u03c6 \u2212 = \u2212\u03c8\u2212\n\n+bs\nbmax\nv\n\nF IG . 1.- Definition of angles.\n\n2\n\n14\n\n1.5\n\n12\n\n\u03c8(b)\n\u03c8(b) (SE)\nd\u03c8/db\nd\u03c8/db (SE)\n\n10\n\n\u03c8 (rad)\n\n0.5\n8\n0\n6\n-0.5\n4\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n-1.5\n-2\n-10\n\n(GM/c2) d\u03c8/db (rad)\n\n1\n\n0\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\nc b/(GM)\n\nF IG . 2.- Bending angle and its derivative as a function of impact parameter for Model 4, calculated using the full metric and the SE metric.\n\na b = 0 photon.

Note that in the full rotational calculation, the retrograde photon takes longer to reach the observer than the\nprograde photon. This is due to the frame-dragging effect.\nThe magnitude of this effect is about 1/10 of the effect due\nto the light-crossing time in the corresponding SE models so\nwe expect that for most timing applications that it will not be\ndetectable.\n2.5. Redshift\nIn our units, the photon's energy as measured by an observer far from the star has been normalized to unity. As a\nresult, any other observer with four-velocity ua measures a\nphoton energy of Eu = \u2212la ua , where the photon's four-velocity\ncomponents la = dxa /d\u03bb are given in Equations 8\u201310.

Zenith Angle\nIf the radiation is not emitted isotropically, the intensity will\ndepend on the initial direction of the photon with respect to\nthe fluid. The angle between the local normal to the star's\nsurface and the direction in which a photon is emitted is the\nzenith angle and will be denoted \u03b1. This angle depends on\nthe frame in which it is measured.

Angles between Photons\nIn a more general calculation of flux from a twodimensional emitting area on the star, we would need to calculate the solid angle subtended by the area, as viewed by the\nobserver at infinity. In this paper, we are only including the\nflux of photons emitted from a segment of the equator into\nthe equatorial plane. Adopting this special one-dimensional\nemission region means that observed radiation will subtend\nzero solid angle in the observer's sky. The most straightforward way of adjusting the usual definition of flux for this simplified emission region is to define flux in terms of an integral\nover angle in the observer's one-dimensional \"sky\" which coincides with the equatorial plane.\nIn Figure 1 we show a curve of angular extent \u2206\u03c6 on the\nstar, and the angle measured by the observer at infinity between the two photons emitted from the end-points (points \u03c6\u2212\n\nand \u03c6+ ) is d\u03b5. If the impact parameters for these two photons\nare related by b+ = b\u2212 + db, the angle observed between the\ntwo photons reduces at infinity to\ndb\n(21)\nd\u03b5 = ,\nr\nif both photons are restricted to move only in the equatorial\nplane. This result is familiar from the usual Schwarzschild\nmetric; its validity for the current case is demonstrated in the\nAppendix.\n2.8. Outline of Numerical Method\nWe now outline the procedures used to compute pulse\nshapes from a rotating neutron star when the photons and the\nobserver are restricted to the equatorial plane. We discretise\nthe period of the star's rotation into Nt bins and keep track of\nbins of flux Fi , and bins of detector integration time Ti , where\ni indicates the period bin in which the flux is received. The\nangular size of the emission region \u2206\u03c6 is related to the number of period bins by \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0/Nt . The centre of the emission\nregion at each step is \u03c6i = (i \u2212 1)(\u2206\u03c6). Figure 1 shows the\nrelevant quantities.\nWe obtain the binned fluxes Fi by performing the following\nsteps at each period step i:\n1. Calculate the impact parameters of the null rays arriving at the observer from \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c6i \u2212 (\u2206\u03c6)/2, \u03c6i , and\n\u03c6+ = \u03c6i + (\u2206\u03c6)/2. Denote these impact parameters by\nb\u2212 , b, and b+ . This is done by numerically solving\nEquation 13.\n2. Calculate the redshift z(b) using Equation 17.\n3. Calculate the zenith angle \u03b1e (b) using Equation 19.\n4. Calculate the angular contribution to the flux integral,\nd\u03b5, using Equation 21.\n5. Calculate the TOAs for the limbs, TOA(b\u2212 ) and\nTOA(b+ ), expressed in units of the rotation period of\nthe star, and \u2206T = |TOA(b\u2212 ) \u2212 TOA(b+ )| . This is done\nvia Equation 14.\n6. Convert the TOAs of the limbs to indices of the flux\nbinning. This is done, schematically, by computing\nj\u00b1 = floor(i + (Nt )(TOA(b\u00b1 ))), where j\u00b1 is the bin corresponding to the arrival time of the flux corresponding\nto b\u00b1 .\n\n\f6\n7. If j+ 6= j\u2212 , the flux from the limbs arrives during different period bins, and one needs to calculate the fractional amount of flux to be assigned to each bin, x\u00b1 ,\nwith x+ + x\u2212 = 1.\n8.

Note that\nthis integral is a non-standard definition of flux which\nwe must adopt because we are dealing with a special one-dimensional emission region, as discussed in\nSection 2.7; the observer only receives photons from\nwithin the equatorial plane (the sky is effectively onedimensional), so the integral is over a one-dimensional\nangle, not the usual solid angle for a two-dimensional\nsky. This integral simplifies in the case of bolometric flux since the integral will be over all energies at\neach step. Since the angle d\u03b5 corresponds to an angle\nbetween photons arriving at different times, this corresponds to the energy deposited in the detector in the\ntime period \u2206T . This flux is then portioned into the\nflux bins Fj\u00b1 using F and x\u00b1 .\n9. The bins of integration time T j\u00b1 are incremented by\n(\u2206T )x\u00b1 .\nOnce the calculation for each period step is completed, the\nnon-zero bins of flux Fi are weighted by dividing by the corresponding integration time Ti . This step is necessary because\nwithout this weighting the fluxes in each bin do not necessarily correspond to uniform intervals of integration time by the\ndetector.\nThe fluxes Fi correspond to the pulse shape for an infinitesimal spot of angular size \u2206\u03c6. To investigate the pulse shapes\nof wider spots of width k(\u2206\u03c6) we can compute the new pulse\nshape Pi by\nk\nX\nPi =\nF(i\u2212k/2)+ j ,\n(23)\nj=0\n\nwhere the values Fi are understood to be periodic in the index\ni. Choosing the offset (i \u2212 k/2) above is arbitrary; this choice\nkeeps the spot initially centred as far as possible on \u03c6 = 0.\nThe rns code calculates the metric potentials to a finite\nvalue of r\u0304, and so our calculation is performed at distant\nr \u2248 1010 cm and not at infinity. We have fully accounted for\nthe very small corrections to the expressions appearing in Section 2 which result from not locating our observer at infinity.\nIn Figure 4 the bolometric pulse shapes computed using this\nalgorithm are shown for the four model stars. In these calculations, the spot size is 0.25\u25e6 for the 300 Hz models, and 0.5\u25e6\nfor the 600 Hz models; these choices were made so that the\nbin widths for these cases corresponded to equal intervals of\ntime. The general effect of rotation is to create an asymmetry\nin the pulse shape that increases as the rotational velocity increases. We have normalized all flux to the peak flux, and the\nmoment the emission region becomes visible is defined to be\nthe start of the period. We have broken each pulse into four\ntime periods: the rise time, the fall time, the total time on and\nthe total time off. These periods are listed in Table 2.\nIn Table 2 it can be seen that increasing the star's compactness M/R increases the fraction of time that the pulse is on.\n\nN OTE. - All times are in \u03bcs, and pulse shape parameters are given\nto \u00b12.3 \u03bcs, corresponding to the width of one period bin.\n\nThis is due to the gravitational bending of light increasing\nthe fraction of the time that the spot is visible. This effect\nis almost independent of the star's spin rate. The asymmetry\nbetween the rise and fall time of the pulse is shown by the\ncolumn trise /tfall in Table 2. The rise time corresponds to time\nduring which the spot first appears on the blueshifted limb to\nthe time of peak intensity. The Doppler boosting effect shifts\nthe phase of maximum intensity to the blue-shifted side of the\nstar, so that the rise time takes less than half of the total time\non. Increasing the speed increases the asymmetry, as can be\nseen by comparing Tables 1 and 2.\n3. APPROXIMATE METHODS FOR PULSE SHAPE\nCALCULATIONS\n\nApproximate methods for pulse shape calculations involve\napproximating the spacetime containing the neutron star by\na metric which is analytically known. For example, in the\nS+D approximation, light-bending and time-delays are calculated as though the star was not rotating, using the method\ndescribed in Pechenick, Ftaclas, & Cohen (1983). Special relativistic effects are included by modeling the star as a rapidlyrotating object with no gravitational field. The photons' redshifts are computed by combining the Schwarzschild gravitational redshift with the special relativistic Doppler effect.\nThis approximate approach is attractive since the gravitational\nfield is completely described by the Schwarzschild metric, for\nwhich simple formulae exist. The S+D approximation has\nbeen described in detail by Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003), so\nonly a brief outline of the method will be given here. However, it should be noted that Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003)\ndo not include time-delays due to different light travel times\nfrom different parts of the star. In Section 3.1, we show how\nthe method employed by Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003) can be\nrecovered from the more general case of Section 2 by taking\nappropriate limits.\nAn alternative, but similar approximation is the use of the\nKerr black hole metric to approximate the gravitational field\nof a rotating neutron star (Chen & Shaham 1989; Braje, Romani, & Rauch 2000; Bhattacharyya et al. 2004). While the\ngravitational fields outside of rotating neutron stars and black\nholes are not the same for arbitrarily fast rotation, the Kerr\nblack hole is a reasonable approximation to a neutron star if\nit is spinning slowly. We expect that the Kerr metric is a reasonable approximation for stars with spin frequencies of 300\nHz, but at 600 Hz there would be large differences. These\ndifferences will be quantified elsewhere.\n3.1. The Schwarzschild + Doppler Approximation\nThe S+D approximation seeks to treat the exterior spacetime of the neutron star as though it is described by the corresponding SE spacetime.

The beginning of the rise for each pulse has been aligned with Phase = 0.\n\nof the star and observer are put in by hand. Consider the SE\nspacetime described by the potentials \u03b1, \u03b3 and \u03c1, with \u03c9 = 0,\nwhere the relationship of the potentials to the star's mass and\nradius is given in Equations 3\u20135. We imagine that the matter\ncomprising the star is still rotating, but take the Schwarzschild\nmetric to be an approximation of the exterior spacetime. Denote the Schwarzschild redshift as zs so that\n1\n.\n1 + zs = p\n1 \u2212 2M/R\n\n(24)\n\nUsing Equation 3, we see that the factor of exp \u2212(\u03b3 + \u03c1)/2 reduces to 1 + zs . The equatorial velocity of the star measured in\nthe SE spacetime of Equation 6 can be written, via Equation 4,\nas veq = \u03a9\u22c6 r\u0304 exp(\u2212\u03c1). Introducing the function\nq\n1 \u2212 v2eq\n,\n(25)\n\u03b7\u2261\n1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22c6 b\nwe see that the Schwarzschild case (\u03c9 \u2192 0) of the exact redshift expression in Equation 17 is given by\nlim (1 + z) =\n\n\u03c9\u21920\n\n(1 + zs)\n,\n\u03b7\n\n(26)\n\nso that \u03b7 plays a role similar to the Doppler boost factor in\nspecial relativity with no gravitational field present.\nNow we express \u03b7 in terms of the zenith angle of Section 2.6. As measured by the co-moving observer and the\nstatic observer, these angles are respectively\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\nb2\n2M\nlim cos \u03b1e = \u03b7 1 \u2212 2 1 \u2212\n,\n(27)\n\u03c9\u21920\nR\nR\nand\n1\nlim cos \u03b1o = lim cos \u03b1e =\n\u03c9\u21920\n\u03b7 \u03c9\u21920\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\nb2\nR2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2M\n.\n1\u2212\nR\n\n(28)\n\nEquation 28 is a quadratic equation for b in terms of \u03b1o with\nthe solution\nR\nsin \u03b1o ,\n(29)\nb = \u00b1p\n1 \u2212 2M/R\n\nwhere the plus/minus sign corresponds to co- and counterrotating photons. If we know the angle \u03b1o for a given photon,\nand solve for the corresponding b via Equation 29, then using\n\nthe definition of \u03b7 from Equation 25 and our expression for\nvelocity in the SE spacetime from Equation 6, we have that\nq\n1 \u2212 v2eq\n\u03b7=\n.\n(30)\n1 \u2213 veq sin \u03b1o\nThis is the usual Doppler factor for redshift without a gravitational field present. This formula, as well as the relationship\nbetween \u03b1e and \u03b1o in Equation 28, agree with the corresponding formulae used by Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003) once it is\nnoticed that they respectively denote our angles \u03b1e and \u03b1o by\n\u03b1\u2032 and \u03b1, and that the four-velocity of the fluid is perpendicular to the normal in the observer's frame. The overall redshift,\nEquation 26, is just the product of the Doppler factor arising from emission in the co-moving frame into the observer's\nframe at the surface, and the Schwarzschild gravitational contribution to redshift as the photons travel to infinity.\nFinally, we turn our attention to the matter of time-delays.\nOne is left with the choice of accounting for the contribution of time delays according to the method described in Section 2.8, or else simply calculating flux directly as a function\nof the emitting region's location. If we elect to do the latter,\nwe can still account for the special relativistic \"snapshot\" effect; this effect arises because the image in the detector at a\ngiven instant is formed by photons emitted at different times\nfrom different parts of the star. These corrections are put in\nby hand, making use of the conformality of the Lorentz transformations discussed by Terrell (1959). The main effect of\nspecial relativity on an area element of the star is that the observed shape is not changed, but the element will be magnified if it is moving away from the observer. As discussed by\nPoutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003), the net result is that in the S+D\napproximation, the solid angle must be calculated using the\nformula\nd\u03a9S+D = \u03b7 d\u03a9o = \u03b7 b db d\u03c6/r2 ,\n(31)\nwhere d\u03a9o is the uncorrected element of solid angle. Note\nthat such a correction need not be applied to the solid angle\nelement when the flux is calculated using the method of Section 2.8 as this method accounts for all effects due to timedelay, i.e., the snapshot effect and the light-crossing time, by\ncorrectly binning the flux emitted by a region of constant angular size. To be clear, when we say a calculation \"includes\ntime-delay effects,\" we mean in the sense of Section 2.8; calculations that do not include these time-delay effects have the\nspecial relativistic Doppler correction applied instead.\n\n\f8\nSince our emitting area is actually one-dimensional, we\nneed to derive the analogue of the S+D solid angle element\nfor one dimension. The calculation for one dimension yields\nthe same Doppler boost factor,\nd\u03b5S+D = \u03b7 db/r = \u03b7\n\nd\u03c8\n,\nr d\u03c8/db\n\n(32)\n\nwhere d\u03c8/db should be evaluated using the Schwarzschild\nmetric and the angle d\u03c8 is the constant angular size of the\nspot.\n3.2. Comparison of Methods\nWe have computed pulse shapes in the S+D approximation\nfor our fiducial star, Model 4. All calculations are for bolometric flux and the same angular emission sizes as in Section 2.8. We show pulse shapes in Figure 5 for four different\ncalculation methods: Method I is the full general relativistic calculation described in Section 2. Method II is similar\nto Method I, but the time-delay binning is not performed and\nthe special relativistic correction for the snapshot effect is included instead. Method III is the S+D approximation including time-delay effects. Method IV is the S+D approximation\nwithout time-delay effects.\nIn Table 3 we show the rise, fall, on and off times for the\npulses computed with these methods. Typically, the differences between the full GR calculation and the S+D approximation is very small, amounting to only a few \u03bcs. The differences between methods that include or do not include timedelay effects is about an order of magnitude larger. The inclusion of time-delays keeps the total on or off time the same\nwithin a few \u03bcs, but decreases the rise time by 50 \u03bcs and increases the fall time by a similar amount. This corresponds to\na change of about 20% in the rise time, which is a resolvable\namount.\nThe total time on is not changed much by the inclusion of\ntime-delays since the asymmetry caused by frame-dragging\nis quite small. However, including time-delays increases the\nasymmetry between the rise and fall times. This effect enters\nbecause the beginning of the pulse corresponds to the moment when the spot is at the limb, where the time-delay is\nlargest. However, the peak intensity corresponds to a moment\nwhen the spot is relatively close to the observer, so the time\ndelay is very small. This effectively delays the beginning of\nthe pulse, but not the time of peak intensity, increasing the\nrise/fall asymmetry. This can have important consequences if\nthe pulse shape is fitted using a method that doesn't include\ntime-delays, since all pulse asymmetry will be incorrectly attributed to the rotation speed.\n4. EFFECTS DUE TO THE EMISSION REGION\n\nWe now consider the sensitivity of the pulse shapes to various properties of the emitting region. The different properties\nconsidered are the emission spectrum, beaming, and the angular size of the emitting region (\"spot size\"). Unless otherwise indicated, our calculations are for the fiducial star (EOS\nL, 600 Hz) using Method I, i.e., using the exact metric with\ntime-delay effects.\nWe computed the phase lag of soft X-rays relative to hard\nX-rays if two detectors sensitive to different energy bands observe a blackbody. We chose a blackbody of 1 keV, a soft\nband of 3\u20135 keV, and a hard band of 5\u20137 keV in order to investigate this effect. In Figure 6 we show the hard and soft\npulse shapes computed using Methods I and II for the fiducial\n\nstar; the same pulse shapes computed using Methods III and\nIV nearly overlap these curves. The peak of soft X-ray flux arrives after the peak of the hard X-ray flux; this phase lag was\ncalculated using all methods and is shown in Table 4. The\nlag is independent (within error) of the calculation method,\nalthough the individual pulse shapes do depend on the calculation method.\nNext we consider the effect of beaming. We consider infinitesimal spots which have different beaming functions and\nshow the bolometric flux. We show the cases of\n1. isotropic emission;\n2. fan beaming, I \u221d 1 \u2212 cos\u03b1e ;\n3. pencil beaming, I \u221d cos4 \u03b1e ; and,\n4. Gaussian beaming, I \u221d exp(\u2212 sin2 \u03b1e /2\u03c3 2 ) with \u03c3 = 0.1.\nFigure 7 shows these four pulse profiles. As the beaming\ntoward the normal increases, the peak intensity arrives later\nsince the light is emitted when the spot is closest to the observer. Hence, an emission region composed of two components with different types of beaming will exhibit phase lags\nwhich can be larger than the Doppler lags in energy.\nThe effect of a larger spot with uniform brightness and no\nbeaming is shown in Figure 8. Not surprisingly, the larger the\nspot size, the broader the peak intensity.\n5. ESTIMATION OF ERRORS IN FITTING RADIUS\n\nWe wish to estimate the error in fitting the radius of the\nstar using the S+D approximation. To do this, we generated\nbolometric flux pulse shapes for the following cases using\nMethod I:\n1. Models 1, 2, 3, 4: isotropic emission, infinitesimal spot;\n2. Models 1, 2, 3, 4: I \u221d 1 \u2212 cos\u03b1e emission, infinitesimal\nspot;\n3. Models 3, 4: isotropic emission, 30\u25e6 spot; and,\n4. Models 3, 4: I \u221d 1 \u2212 cos\u03b1e emission, 30\u25e6 spot.\nTo these we fit pulse shapes for one-dimensional emission\nfrom an infinitesimal region calculated using the S+D approximation without time-delays together with either the lightbending approximation of Beloborodov (2002) or the exact\nlight-bending formula of Equation 13 to obtain a fitted radius. The fits performed with the exact light-bending formula can be considered as a similar method to that employed\nby Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003) for fitting observations of\nSAX J1808.4-3658 to obtain a fitted radius; however, our\nmethod is specific to the one-dimensional flux we defined\nin Section 2.8 for emission and observation restricted to the\nequatorial plane. The results are summarised in Table 5 for\nthe fits using approximate light-bending, and Table 6 for the\nfits using exact light-bending. The quality of the fits were\ngenerally good for the cases of isotropic emission, and the fits\nwere quite poor for the fan beam emission. To understand\nthe poor quality of these fits, note that for fan beam emission most of the flux is recorded when the emitting region is\nnear the limbs of the star, so the effects due to time-delays\nare significant; another effect is the poor performance of the\nlight-bending approximation at these locations (Beloborodov\n2002), but an examination of the results in Tables 5 and 6 indicates that this is a comparatively small effect on the quality\n\n\fPulse Shapes from Rapidly-Rotating Neutron Stars\n\n9\n\nTABLE 3\nB OLOMETRIC P ULSE S HAPES U SING D IFFERENT C ALCULATION\nM ETHODS\nMethod\n\nRise\n\nFall\n\nOn\n\nOff\n\nI (Full GR, with TD)\nII (Full GR, without TD)\nIII (SE Model, with TD)\nIV (SE Model, without TD)\n\n231.5\n263.9\n233.8\n268.5\n\n787.0\n747.7\n775.5\n740.7\n\n1018.5\n1011.6\n1009.3\n1009.3\n\n648.1\n655.1\n657.4\n657.4\n\ntrise /tfall\n0.29\n0.35\n0.30\n0.36\n\nN OTE. - Comparison of timing parameters describing bolometric pulse\nshapes from different calculation methods, using Model 4 (Period = 1.6667\nms).

It is also worth noting that good fits do not necessarily imply good performance in obtaining the true radius; for\nexample, the isotropic Model 1 calculation with approximate\nlight-bending performs quite poorly at obtaining the radius,\nwhile the fit was relatively good.\nConsidering the Method I cases with an infinitesimal spot\nin both sets of fits, the radius is generally overestimated by up\nto 9.8%, with the exception of the fit to the fan-beam case for\nModel 3 calculated with exact light-bending, where the result\nwas a poor quality fit underestimating the radius by 0.8%. The\ntendency to overestimate the radius is a result of the fits ignoring the time-delay effect, so that all asymmetries between the\nrise and fall time (trise /tfall in Tables 2 and 3) are attributed to\nthe equatorial speed of the star. This forces the fitting program to assume a larger speed and therefore a larger radius\n(since the spin frequency is fixed). Of the four models computed with isotropic emission Model 4 has the worst quality\nfit, which is not surprising since it was chosen to maximize\nthe effects of rotation.\nFor the 30\u25e6 emitting region, the fits underestimate the actual radius by up to 11.4%. The change in fit radius from the\ninfinitesimal case is \u22123.8\u2013\u221217.8%, which is in part cancelled\nby the positive error in all but one of the infinitesimal cases.\nMore compact stars have light visible for a longer fraction of\ntheir period, and so the fit attempts to compensate for the effect of a large emitting region (which is visible for a longer\nfraction of the period) by making the star more compact.\nWe also performed fits with approximate light-bending to\nthe pulse shapes for Model 4 calculated using Methods II, III,\nand IV for a 0.5\u25e6 spot with both isotropic and fan beam emission; Table 5 shows the results for the isotropic cases. Methods I and II both use the exact metric, but Method II does not\ninclude time-delays. The difference between the fitted radii\nobtained for these methods is 0.3 km for isotropic emission,\nand 1.3 km for fan beam emission. Comparing the fitted radii\nfor pulse shapes that differ only by the selection of the metric\n(SE or exact), the differences in the obtained radius ranged\nfrom 0.03\u20130.17 km, depending on beaming and the inclusion\nof time-delay effects. In this case the largest effect on the\nfitted radius comes from the inclusion of time-delay effects,\nwith the effect due to the metric approximation about an order of magnitude smaller. We expect the errors arising from\nthe approximation of the metric to get larger for more compact\nmodels, i.e., softer EOS, as the frame-dragging effect can be\nlarger for such stars, while the time-delay effects would get\nsmaller owing to the shorter light-crossing time.\nFinally, the error in the fitted radius obtained when we fit\nto the Model 4 pulse shape calculated using the S+D approximation without time-delays (Method IV) was 0.02 km for\nisotropic emission and 0.1 km for fan beam emission. This\nerror arises only from the Beloborodov (2002) approximation\nfor light-bending used by the fitting procedure.\nComparing the set of results using approximate lightbending in Table 5 to the results using exact light-bending\nin Table 6, it is clear that it is not uniformly true that fitting\nwith the exact light-bending formula necessarily yields improved results, improved fit quality, or both. For example,\nthe calculations for Model 4 with isotropic emission and an\ninfinitesimal emission region is an example where the use of\nthe exact light-bending formula actually yields a poorer fit to\nthe radius, and a poorer quality of fit.\n\n11\n\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nObservations of the pulse profile of light emitted from the\nsurface of a neutron star have the potential to constrain the\nstar's mass, radius, and equation of state. Restricting ourselves to the case of light emitted and received in the equatorial plane of a rapidly-rotating neutron star, we have compared\na variety of methods to calculate the pulse shapes observed by\na distant observer; this restriction requires us to use a definition of flux adapted to the one-dimensional nature of the emitting region which was employed for all of our calculations. In\nparticular, we have compared the use of an exact neutron star\nmetric including a general relativistic treatment of all effects\ndue to rotation, with the use of an associated Schwarzschild\nmetric where the effects due to rotation of the star are put in by\nhand (the \"Schwarzschild + Doppler\" (S+D) approximation).\nFor each of these cases we have either included the effects\nof time-delays by fully accounting for the times of arrival of\nphotons from different locations on the star, or else neglected\nthe totality of these effects and only applied a special relativistic Doppler correction to account for the so-called \"snapshot\"\neffect.\nThe time-delay effects which we are able to account for can\nbe split into two classes: effects owing to the light-crossing\ntime which are also present for static stars, and effects owing\nto frame-dragging which is present in an exact calculation of\nthe neutron star spacetime. For our fiducial star, a 600 Hz,\n1.4M\u2299 neutron star with R = 16.38 km, accounting for the\nlight-crossing time had the effect of decreasing the rise time\nand increasing the fall time of the calculated pulse by about\n50 \u03bcs, which is about 20% of the rise time and is a resolvable\namount. Effects due to frame-dragging in this case were about\nan order of magnitude smaller. While we found that the calculation method does change the pulse shape, we found that the\ncalculation of the total lag between the peaks of flux in soft\nand hard X-rays for a simple blackbody emission spectrum\ndid not strongly depend on the calculation method used.\nConstraints on the stellar parameters are obtained by fitting\ntheoretical pulse shapes to observations. We wished to determine whether a fitting routine which uses the S+D approximation without time-delay effects could accurately determine the\nparameters corresponding to pulse shapes calculated with all\neffects included. Using an exact treatment of photon propagation from an infinitesimal one-dimensional emission region,\nwe created artificial light curves for a number of different neutron stars and equatorial emission types. We then attempted to\nfit these light curves using a code based on the S+D approximation without time-delays to obtain a fitted radius. We found\nfor infinitesimal emission regions that fitting to the approximate pulse shapes tends to overestimate the stellar radius by\nup to 9.8%. On the other hand, fitting to a pulse shape for an\nemission region that is 30\u25e6 wide has the effect of underestimating the radius by up to about 10%. Furthermore, the quality of these fits was quite poor in the case of emission which\nwas preferentially emitted in the horizontal direction. These\nresults should not be misconstrued as a claim that the analysis\nof SAX J1808.4-3658 observations by Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski\n(2003) is flawed since our calculations only provide a worstcase scenario. The X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 rotates\nat a slower rate than our fastest neutron star model, and most\nlikely emits its radiation from high latitudes where the S+D\napproximation should be more valid.\nIn this paper we have restricted our attention to photons\nemitted from the equator whose paths stay in the equato-\n\n\f12\nTABLE 5\nF ITS TO R ADIUS U SING A PPROXIMATE L IGHT-B ENDING F ORMULA\nMethod\n\nModel\n\nI\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n3\n4\n3\n4\n\nII\nIII\nIV\nI\n\nSpot Size\n\nFitted Radius (km)\n\nPercent Errora\n\nS.Sq./N (\u00d710\u22124 ) b\n\nisotropic\n\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n\nI \u221d 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1e\n\nisotropic\n\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n30\u25e6\n\nI \u221d 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1e\n\n30\u25e6\n\n10.517\n10.344\n15.646\n16.747\n16.463\n16.788\n16.358\n10.348\n10.744\n15.456\n17.765\n15.045\n15.68\n14.495\n14.783\n\n+9.3\n+5.7\n+3.6\n+2.2\n+0.5\n+2.5\n\u22120.1\n+7.6\n+9.8\n+2.3\n+8.5\n\u22120.4\n\u22124.3\n\u22124.1\n\u22129.7\n\n0.72\n0.38\n0.045\n3.2\n0.14\n2.8\n0.25\n34\n67\n36\n59\n0.82\n2.3\n42\n55\n\nEmission\n\na Positive\n\nvalues indicate fitted values are too large, negative values indicate fitted values are too small.\nsum of squared differences between fitted approximate calculation and rapid-rotation calculation divided\nby the number of phase bins in the exact pulse shape.\nb The\n\nTABLE 6\nF ITS TO R ADIUS U SING E XACT L IGHT-B ENDING F ORMULA\nMethod\n\nModel\n\nI\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n3\n4\n3\n4\n\nSpot Size\n\nFitted Radius (km)\n\nPercent Errora\n\nS.Sq./N (\u00d710\u22124 ) b\n\nisotropic\n\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n0.25\u25e6\n0.5\u25e6\n30\u25e6\n\nI \u221d 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1e\n\n30\u25e6\n\n9.70\n9.975\n15.19\n16.85\n9.73\n10.28\n14.98\n17.66\n14.44\n15.71\n13.93\n14.51\n\n+0.8\n+2.0\n+0.5\n+2.9\n+1.1\n+5.1\n\u22120.8\n+7.8\n\u22124.4\n\u22124.1\n\u22127.8\n\u221211.4\n\n0.44\n2.7\n0.50\n4.8\n24\n56\n32\n58\n0.61\n3.0\n33\n49\n\nEmission\nisotropic\n\nI \u221d 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1e\n\na Positive\n\nvalues indicate fitted values are too large, negative values indicate fitted values are too small.\nsum of squared differences between fitted approximate calculation and rapid-rotation calculation divided\nby the number of phase bins in the exact pulse shape.\nb The\n\nrial plane, mainly because the effects of rotation should be\nstrongest for these photons. However, if the emission area is\nlarge and encompasses a wide range of latitudes on the star,\nwe expect that the varying shape of the star will have an important effect. Rotation causes a star to become oblate, and\nthe effective gravitational field at the poles is larger than at\nthe equator. As a result, the static part of the gravitational\nredshift is larger at the poles than at the equator. In addition, light emitted near the poles will experience a greater\ngravitationally-induced time delay. We intend to explore the\neffect of rotation on pulses observed from spots and observers\nat a range of latitudes in a future publication.\nThis research was supported by grants from NSERC.

DERIVATION OF THE OBSERVED ANGLE BETWEEN PHOTONS\n\nEquation 21 gives the infintesimal angle d\u03b5 formed by the world lines of two photons as measured by a static observer located in\nthe equatorial plane at infinity. Let the two photons have four-velocities la and ma , with impact parameters b+ and b\u2212 , respectively.\nThe angle is calculated as in Section 2.6: The oberserver has ua \u221d t a , and we define the projection operator as h(\u221e)\nab \u2261 gab + ua ub\n(\u221e) b\nu\nand the magnitudes of the projected null vectors as l \u2261 |l\u22a5 | = |hab l |. The angle is calculated by the inner product of the\nprojected vectors:\ncos \u03b5 =\n\na b\nh(\u221e)\nab l\u22a5 m\u22a5\nl u mu\n\n\u0013\ne2\u03c1\n2\n\u2212\n\u03c9\nr\u03042\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\nb2\u2212 e2\u03c1\nb2+ e2\u03c1\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9b\u2212) \u2212 2 .\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9b+) \u2212 2\nr\u0304\nr\u0304\n\n= \u03c9(b+ + b\u2212 ) + b+b\u2212\ns\u0014\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n(A1)\n\nThis formula is only valid when the photons are restricted to move in the equatorial plane, i.e., u\u03b8 = 0. To get the infinitesimal\nversion of this equation, put b+ = b\u2212 + db, and Taylor expand the left-hand side for small angles d\u03b5. Expanding the right-hand side\nin db and equating the second-order terms gives:\n\u0014\n\u0015\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012 2 2\n2 2\u03c1\n\u03c9 2 r\u03042 \u2212 e2\u03c1\n\u03c9 b\u2212 r\u0304 \u2212 b\u2212 e2\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9r\u03042\n2 b\u2212 e\n2\n2\nd\u03b5 = \u2212db (1 \u2212 \u03c9b\u2212) \u2212 2\n.\n(A2)\n\u2212\nr\u0304\nr\u03042 (1 \u2212 \u03c9b\u2212)2 \u2212 b2\u2212e2\u03c1\nr\u03042 (1 \u2212 \u03c9b\u2212)2 \u2212 b2\u2212e2\u03c1\nIn the large r\u0304 limit, \u03c9 falls off as 1/r\u03043 , so to leading order in 1/r\u0304 the first term in square brackets is \u223c 1 and the second term in\nsquare brackets is \u223c \u2212e2\u03c1 /r\u03042 .
