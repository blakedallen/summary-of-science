In case of a conventional semiconductor, donors (acceptors) supply electrons (holes) in a band insulator. A metal-insulator transition takes place at a critical carrier density, where the\naverage carrier-carrier distance is comparable with the\neffective Bohr radius of the doped impurity atom. The\ncritical carrier density has been quantitatively discussed\nfor various semiconductors [2].\nMetal-insulator transitions in strongly correlated systems are completely different from that in a band insulator [3]. The most remarkable example is that in hightemperature superconductors, where the metallic state is\naccompanied by high temperature superconductivity. As\nthe second example, the colossal magnetoresistive manganites exhibit a peculiar transition where the metallic\nstate is stabilized by ferromagnetism. Actually, there are\nmany types of insulating state (Mott insulator, charge ordering, and stripes) for strongly correlated systems, and\naccordingly there are so many ways how these insulating\nstates collapse upon doping, pressure, temperature, and\nexternal field.\nSince transition-metal oxides are often insulating due\nto the strong correlation, they can be a good playground\nfor studies of metal-insulator transitions. In this sense,\nwe have paid special attention to CaPd3 O4 . Figure\n1 shows the crystal structure of CaPd3 O4 known as a\nNaPt3 O4 -type structure. The divalent Pd2+ of (4d)8 is\nsurrounded with four O2\u2212 anions, and the PdO4 clusters\nstack one another to form a column. Because of the cubic symmetry, the PdO4 column runs along the x, y, z\ndirections to make a thee-dimensional network.\nThe first interesting point is that CaPd3 O4 shows a\nmetal-insulator transition by substitution of Na for Ca,\nas was found by Itoh et al [4, 5]. Secondly, the ground\nstate of CaPd3 O4 might be exotic. Hase and Nishihra [6]\nclaimed that CaPd3 O4 was a possible candidate for an\nexcitonic insulator, in which electrons and holes bounded\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: terra@waseda.jp\n\nas excitons exhibit a Bose-Einstein condensation at low\ntemperatures. Thirdly, a Pd ion is more stable as Pd2+\nand Pd4+ than Pd3+ . Such a kind of ion is called \"valence\nskipper\". Thus the doped holes are most likely to exist\nas Pd4+ , where two holes are on the same Pd site. Varma\n[7] predicted that doped carriers in the valence skipper\nform on-site pairs to exhibit a possible high-temperature\nsuperconductivity.\nIn this paper we report on measurement and analysis of\nthe transport properties of Li doped CaPd3 O4 . We have\nfound that CaPd3 O4 is essentially a degenerate semiconductor of low carrier concentration (1019 cm\u22123 ). With\nincreasing Li content, the resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the Hall coefficient systematically change, from\nwhich the carrier concentration and the effective mass are\nreasonably evaluated.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nPolycrystalline samples of Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4 (x=0, 0.1,\n0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6) were prepared by a solidstate reaction aided with NaCl addition.

The product was finely\nground, and NaCl was rinsed out in hot distilled water.\nThe dried powder was then pressed into pellets, and was\nsintered in air at 1223 K for 48 h for x=0, and at 1103\nK for 12 h for x > 0 .\nWe think that NaCl acts as a kind of flux. At an\nearly stage of this study, 20% of metal Pd appeared as\nan impurity phase in the powder sintered above 1173 K\nwithout NaCl, suggesting that the sintering temperature\nwas too high to keep Pd oxidized. We then decreased the\nsintering temperature, but found that the prepared samples were loosely sintered, too fragile to handle. Added\nNaCl was effective to decrease the sintering temperature\nwithout reducing PdO.\nThe samples were characterized through the x-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) with Fe K\u03b1 as an x-ray source in a\n\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b8 scan mode. The resistivity was measured by a\nfour-terminal method from 4.2 to 300 K in a liquid He\ncryostat, and from 300 to 700 K in a cylinder furnace\nin air. The Seebeck coefficient was measured using a\nsteady-state technique with a typical temperature gradient of 1.0 K/cm from 4.2 to 300 K in a liquid He cryostat,\nand from 300 to 500 K in a cylinder furnace in air. The\nSeebeck coefficient of the voltage leads was carefully subtracted. The Hall coefficient was measured in a closed\nrefrigerator from 10 to 150 K. A cernox resistive thermometer was placed at 45 cm above the magnet core,\nwhich successfully suppressed the magnetoresistance of\nthe thermometer to keep the accuracy of the measured\ntemperature within 0.01% at 7 T.

An unwanted signal occurring from a misalignment of the voltage pads was carefully removed by\nsubtracting negative-field data from positive-field data.\nThe Hall voltage was linear in magnetic field, and the\nHall coefficient was determined by the data at \u00b17 T.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 2 shows typical XRD patterns of the prepared\nsamples. For x = 0, all the reflection peaks are indexed\nas a NaPt3 O4 -type structure with an a-axis length a0 of\n5.74 \u00c5[8]. As is shown in the inset, a0 decreases systematically with x, which clearly indicates that Li+ (0.76\u00c5)\nand Ca2+ (1.00\u00c5) make a solid solution. For x = 0.3,\nhowever, a tiny (5%) trace of reduced Pd is observed\nnear 2\u03b8 =51 deg. The amount of the reduced Pd gradually increases with x for x > 0.3, and exceeds 10% for\nx > 0.6.\nFigure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the\nresistivity (\u03c1) of the prepared samples. The resistivity\nchanges systematically with x, whose magnitude at 4.2\nK decreases by four orders of magnitude from x = 0 to\n0.6. This clearly indicates that the substituted Li supplies carriers into the sample. Towards 0 K, \u03c1 for x = 0\ndivergingly increases while \u03c1 for x = 0.1 remains a finite\nvalue. This means the metal-insulator transition takes\n\n\f0.4\n\n10-1\n\nx=0\nx=0.1\nx=0.2\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n0.3\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n(a)\nx=0.6\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n(b)\n\nFermi Energy (eV)\n\nCa1-xLixPd3O4\n\n(\u03c0kB/e)2 T/2S (eV)\n\n100\n\n3\n\nHall coefficient (cm /C)\n\n3\n\n80\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n0.3\nm*/m=4\n0.2\nm*/m=6\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nLi content x\n\nFIG. 4: The Hall coefficient of Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4\n\nplace between x = 0 and 0.1.\nFigure 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the\nSeebeck coefficient (S) of the prepared samples. All the\nSeebeck coefficients are positive, indicating that the majority carrier is a hole in this system. S for x = 0 is\nroughly proportional to temperature below 100 K, which\nis a hallmark of a conventional metal. In the sense\nthat a finite carrier concentration remains as T \u2192 0,\nCaPd3 O4 is essentially a metal. Considering the large\nthermopower, it would be more appropreate to regard\nCaPd3 O4 as a degenerate semiconductor rather than a\nmetal. With increasing x, S systematically decreases,\nwhich indicates that the substituted Li supplies holes to\nCa1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4 . The doped samples also show a similar T -linear Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures to\nthe x = 0 sample. At high temperatures for smaller x,\nthe Seebeck coefficient takes a maximum and decreases\nwith increasing temperature. This means that the minority carriers (electrons in this case) are thermally excited,\nand also means that the band gap of CaPd3 O4 is smaller\nthan hundreds of K.\nFigure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the Hall\ncoefficient (RH ) of the prepared samples. As is similar to\nthe Seebeck coefficient, the sign of the Hall coefficient is\npositive for all the samples, indicating the majority carriers are holes. The magnitude systematically decreases\nwith increasing x, and RH 's for x = 0.1 and 0.2 are essentially independent of temperature. These results are\nwhat is expected in a conventional metal, magnitude of\nwhich is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration.\nWe should note that RH for x = 0 saturates as T \u2192 0.\nThis clearly indicates that CaPd3 O4 is essentially a degenerate semiconductor with a low carrier concentration\nof 1019 cm\u22123 , which is consistent with the T -linear S.\nContrary to the theoretical prediction by Hase and Nishihara [6], CaPd3 O4 is unlikely to be an excitonic insulator\nhaving the charge gap of the order of an exciton binding\nenergy at low temperatures. Thus we conclude that the\nnonmetallic \u03c1 for x = 0 is due to localization effects. RH\nfor x = 0 exhibits remarkable temperature dependence,\nwhich implies the existence of the additional carriers ac-\n\nFIG. 5: (a) The Fermi energy evaluated from the Seebeck\ncoefficient.

This further suggests that the activation energy is smaller than a few tens of K, because RH\nis clearly dependent on temperature down to 10 K. The\nsmall activation energy can also explain the 170-K peak\nin S for x = 0, where the thermally activated electrons\ndominates at high temperatures. It is not surprising that\nRH and S show different temperature dependences. According to a two-band model consisting of electrons and\nholes, RH and S are averaged with different weights of\nelectron (\u03c3e ) and hole (\u03c3h ) conductivities. A more quantitive analysis would be difficult, unless \u03c3e and \u03c3h were\nexperimentally determined.\nA possible candidate for the small activation energy is\nthe band gap of CaPd3 O4 . According to the intuitive\nexplanation by Doublet et al. [9], the valence band of\nCaPd3 O4 consists of Pd 4dz2 , while the conduction band\nconsists of Pd 4dx2 \u2212y2 hybridized strongly with O 2p.\nOwing to the large dispersion of the Pd 4dz2 band, the\nenergy gap between the valence and conduction bands is\nexpected to be small. In fact, the band calculation [6]\nshowed that CaPd3 O4 was a semi-metal with zero bandgap.\nNow we will make a quantitative discussion on the\nmetal-insulator transition in CaPd3 O4 . As already\nmentioned, Li substitution supplies holes in CaPd3 O4 ,\nand the doped holes seem \"normal\", in the sense that\nthey give the T -linear Seebeck coefficients and the T independent Hall coefficients at low temperature. Thus\nwe employ the simplest formula of RH = 1/ne, where n is\nthe hole concentration. Then RH 's for x = 0.1 (7.7\u00d710\u22122\ncm3 /C) and x = 0.2 (3.7\u00d710\u22122 cm3 /C) correspond to\n0.08 and 0.16 holes per unit formula, respectively. In\nspite of the rough estimation, the hole concentration obtained from RH is in good agreement with x, and we can\nroughly assume that the Li content x supplies x holes per\nLi cation.\nIn the lowest order approximation, the Seebeck coeffi-\n\n\f4\ncient of a conventional metal is expressed as\nS=\u2212\n\n2\n\u03c0 2 kB\nT\n2eEF\n\nwhere EF is the Fermi energy. Then EF can be experimentally determined from the T -linear part of the See2\nbeck coefficient as EF = \u03c0 2 kB\nT /2e2S [eV]. Figure 5(a)\n2 2\n2\nshows \u03c0 kB T /2e S for the prepared samples. All the\ndata are roughly independent of temperature at 80 K,\nfrom which we evaluate EF for each sample. We think\nthat T /S at low temperatures is less reliable, owing to the\nsmall magnitude of S and low sensitivity of the copperconstantan thermocouple below 10 K.\nFigure 5(b) shows the evaluated EF plotted as a function of x. We further assume a nearly free hole with an\neffective mass of m\u2217 , the Fermi energy is written as\n\u0001 23\nh\u03042\nh\u03042\n2\nEF =\n3\u03c0\nn\n=\n2m\u2217\n2m\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 23\nm\n2 2x\n3\u03c0 3\n.\na0\nm\u2217\n\nwhere m is the bare mass of an electron (Note that a\nunit cell includes two unit formulae). The dotted and\nsolid curves show the calculated EF with m\u2217 /m =4 and\n6, respectively, between which the evaluated EF lies.\nThis means that the effective mass of Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4\nis nearly independent of x, and is moderately (4-6 times)\nenhanced from the bare mass, possibly owing to the 4d\nnature.\nFinally we will make brief comments on remaining issues. (i) Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4 is a possible candidate for a ptype thermoelectric oxide [10]. A thermoelectric material\nis a material that converts heat into electric power, and\nelectric power into heat, through the thermoelectric phenomena in solids. The thermoelectric power factor S 2 /\u03c1\nis 1.6 \u03bcW/cm K2 for x = 0.4 at 300 K, which is comparable to the value for the polycrystalline NaCo2 O4 known\nas a promising candidate for a thermoelectric oxide [11].\n(ii) At present, we have no direct evidence that the doped\nholes form on-site pairs like Pd4+ . The charge transport\nobserved in the present paper is quantitatively explained\nin terms of nearly free holes with the enhanced mass. In\nother words, this system is highly robust against charge\ndisproportionaltion and/or charge density wave. The or-\n\n[1] N. F. Mott, Metal-insulator transition 2nd ed.

In the case\nof Bi oxides, the valence skipper effects are most remarkable in BaBiO3 , where the charge ordered state of Bi3+\nand Bi5+ are stabilized. With doping, the Bi3+ -Bi5+\nstate collapses and the band picture gradually recovers.\nIn the present study, the Pd4+ content is less than 10 %,\nand this corresponds to BaPb1\u2212xBix O3 (x < 0.2) which\ncan be explained by the band picture [12]. Thus it would\nbe more tempting to synthesize a Pd oxide consisting\nof (formally) Pd3+ to search for the valence skipper effects. (iii) The small band gap implies that electrons can\nbe doped in the conduction band. Preliminarily we succeeded in electron doping by substitution of a trivalent\nion (La3+ , Y3+ , and Bi3+ ) for Ca2+ . (iv) The present results are quite different from \u03c1 and S for Ca1\u2212x Nax Pd3 O4\nby Itoh et al.[4, 5] We prepared Na substituted samples,\nbut found that \u03c1 and S were essentially the same as those\nfor Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4 . We employed \"NaCl flux\" technique\nto suppress reduction of PdO, but Itoh et al. used conventional solid state reaction. Thus the different preparation method might give different samples.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the Hall\ncoefficient for Ca1\u2212x Lix Pd3 O4 (x=0-0.6) have been measured and analyzed. Since the parent material CaPd3 O4\nis a degenerate semiconductor with a finite carrier concentration of 1019 cm\u22123 , it is unlikely to be an excitonic\ninsulator as suggested by Hase and Nishihara [6]. The\nmetal-insulator transition in this system is thus basically\ndriven by localization effects. The carrier concentration\ndependence of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients is consistently explained in terms of a simple one-band picture, where a hole with a moderately enhanced mass\n(m\u2217 /m \u223c4-6) is itinerant three-dimensionally.\nThe authors would like to thank T.
