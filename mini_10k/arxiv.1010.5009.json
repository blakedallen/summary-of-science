This is done in a restricted kinematical region where the Wilson loop is\nembedded in an R1,1 subspace of four dimensional Minkowski space.\nThe idea is very simple. One starts from the one loop result and then performs the OPE\nexpansion. Each term of this expansion corresponds to the exchange of a free particle. Next\nwe include the one loop energy or anomalous dimension for each particle. The expansion\nbreaks the cyclic symmetry of the answer. If one completes it in the simplest way one\nobtains a two loop answer that has the correct expansion in all the OPE channels. The\ncomputation is particularly simple because at two loops one can organize the states into\nSL(2, R) representations. With R1,1 kinematics only one SL(2) representation contributes\n(for each momentum), hence all states have the same anomalous dimension.\n2\n\n\fThe two loop functions obtained in this fashion agree with explicit results computed\nby more direct methods [2] [3] or by other inspired guesswork [4]. These were checked\nnumerically in [4] against the direct perturbative computation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We first review the OPE expansion for Wilson loops\nand explain why we have an SL(2) symmetry at two loops. We then discuss the derivation of\nthe two loop results for the octagon and decagon from this points of view, leaving the general\nn case for appendix A. We then say a few words about the three loop octagon and present\nsome conclusions. In appendix B we discuss some aspects of the spectrum of excitations\naround the flux tube that stretches between two null Wilson lines. This can also be viewed\nas the spectrum of excitations around the infinite spin limit of finite twist operators, or the\nGKP [5] string.\n\n2\n\nOPE review\n\nThe Operator Product Expansion for polygonal null Wilson loops is a certain expansion for\nthe expectation value of a Wilson loop correlator in the limit where two or more consecutive\nedges become collinear. For more details see [1].\nWe consider a polygonal Wilson loop made out of n null segments. The collinear limit\nis approached as follows. We choose two null lines that belong to the Wilson loop polygon.\nThese null lines are then extended. The two null lines preserve an SL(2) \u00d7 R\u03c3 \u00d7 SO(2)\u03c6\nsubgroup of the conformal group. Using these null lines and two other arbitrary null lines\nwe define a reference \"square\". This selects a dilatation operator R\u03c4 inside SL(2), see figure\n1. This reference square is invariant under three commuting symmetries R\u03c4 \u00d7 R\u03c3 \u00d7 SO(2)\u03c6 .\nTwo of the symmetries are non-compact and are particular elements of the conformal group.\nThen a family of polygons is constructed by acting on the bottom part of the original polygon\nwith these symmetries and joining it to the original top part of the polygon. Schematically\nwe have\nhW i(\u03c4, \u03c3, \u03c6) \u2261 htop|e\u2212\u03c4 E+i\u03c3P +i\u03c6J |bottomi\n(1)\nThis has an expansion in terms of intermediate states which are excitations of the flux tube\nthat goes between the two selected null sides. Such states can also be described in terms of\nexcitations around the infinite spin limit of local operators with spin. This correspondence\nwith local operators enables the computation of the properties of the propagating states.\nA slight complication is that, strictly speaking, the Wilson loop correlation is zero. That\nis due to certain well understood UV divergencies. After introducing a UV cut-off one\nremains with a finite answer. These symmetries are broken in a precise way determined by\nan explicitly known anomaly [6]. We can thus take into account the effects of the anomaly.\nA standard way to take it into account is to consider the ratio function\nhW i\neR = \u0002\n\u0003\u0393cusp\nhW iU (1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the denominator is the same Wilson loop but in a U (1) theory, with the coupling\nreplaced by \u0393cusp . This ratio is a finite quantity, free of anomaly, known as the remainder\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: We start from a general Wilson loop. We select two null lines, denoted in red.\nWe then act with symmetries that are preserved by these null lines on one of the sides. The\ntwo null lines preserve a certain SL(2) symmetry. Selecting a dilatation operator inside this\nSL(2) amounts to a choice of a reference square, denoted here by the red dashed lines. This\nallows us to perform an expansion which has the rough form seen on the right. The first\nterm comes from the exchange of the flux tube vacuum. The second from the exchange of\na single excitation on the flux tube, the third from two excitations, etc. The denominators\ncan be viewed as normalization factors, as we usually have in the standard OPE.\nfunction [6]. Unfortunately, in the OPE expansion of R one has already subtracted off some\ninteresting contributions from the OPE expansion of hW iU (1) , which is non-trivial. This\nmakes it difficult to apply our program to directly to R.\nFor us, in order to perform the OPE, it is convenient to introduce the following ratio\nfunction\n\u0013\n\u0012\nhW ihW square i\n(3)\nr = log\nhW top ihW bottom i\nwhere the \"square\", \"top\" and \"bottom\" polygons are defined in figure 2. We can get rid of\nthe divergencies completely if we choose a reference square that coincides with some of the\ncusps of the original polygon, see figure 2.1 In this fashion we can have a well defined and\nnon-vanishing answer already at one loop. The price we pay is however that r is not cyclic\ninvariant. The remainder function differs from r in a simple way [1]\nR \u2212 r = Rtop + Rbottom \u2212 \u0393cusp rU (1) .\n\n(4)\n\nand only the last term contributes to the OPE expansion.\nAs an example consider the octagon in R1,1 kinematics, see figure 3.a. We label the\nlocation of the cusps as\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n{. . . , (x+\ni , xi\u22121 ), (xi , xi ), (xi+1 , xi ), . . . } ,\n1\n\n(5)\n\nFor a general reference square, the ratio (3) does not quite get rid of divergencies, it leaves some\nunimportant single logarigthmic divergencies which have zero momentum (under R\u03c3 ). Here we will make\nthe choice in figure 2 which gets rid of this ambiguity.\n\n4\n\n\fSquare\n\ner\nTop\n\nBottom\n\nFigure 2: Definition of a ratio function that is finite and conformal invariant. It involves\nthe selection of a reference square whose vertices (across a diagonal) coincide with vertices\nof the original polygon.\nwhere x\u00b1 = x \u00b1 t. For the Octagon, we fix these locations at\n2\u03c4\nx+\ni = {\u2212\u221e, \u22121, 0, e } ,\n\n\u22122\u03c3\nx\u2212\n}.\ni = {\u2212\u221e, \u22121, 0, e\n\n(6)\n\nThe corresponding ratio function at one loop reads\nrUoctagon\n=\u2212\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng2\nlog 1 + e\u22122\u03c4 log 1 + e\u22122\u03c3\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThis is the \"seed\" that we will use to get the two loop answer. This one loop result is the\nsame as the result we would obtain in a U (1) theory and it only comes from a single gluon\n(or single photon) exchange between the various null segments.\n\n2.1\n\nSL(2, R) symmetry at two loops\n\nWhen we choose two null lines we preserve an SL(2) \u00d7 R\u03c3 \u00d7 SO(2)\u03c6 symmetry which is\na subgroup of the full conformal group, SO(2, 4). Here we will make some remarks about\nthe SL(2) symmetry. This SL(2) symmetry is broken by the flux tube. However, the mere\nexistence of a flux tube is an effect of order g 2 . In fact, we will see that some consequences\nof the SL(2) symmetry are still preserved at low enough orders in perturbation theory. Let\nus start with the one loop answer. This arises from the propagation of free particles between\nthe edges of a square, as in figure 1. A factor of g 2 already rises by creating and annihilating\nthe excitation from the Wilson contour. Thus, the propagation in the bulk occurs as in the\nfree theory. In the free theory this SL(2) is, of course, a symmetry, since it is just a subgroup\nof the full conformal group. Thus, the particles being exchanged form multiplets under this\nsymmetry. An SL(2) representation consists of a primary P , or lowest weight state, and an\ninfinite set of descendents of the form Pn = (L\u22121 )n P . More explicitly, in the case of R1,1\nn\nkinematics, the only relevant operator is F+\u2212 and the descendents are D\u2212\nF+\u2212 .

The red dashed line is the reference square we start with. (b) A different choice of\nreference square that is suitable for an OPE expansion in the same channel as in (a). In\nthat example, the two choices of reference squares only differ by the position of the \"bottom\"\ncusp at 0 (a) and \u2212\u000f (b). The corresponding OPE expansion parameters are related by the\ninfinitesimal transformation \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + 2\u000f e\u22122\u03c4 . We must be able to re-write the OPE expansion\nafter this transformation in the same form as before with the same anomalous dimensions.\nThat is only possible if \u03b3k (p) is independent of k. In (c) and (d) we draw the same picture\nas it would have looked like if the Octagon under consideration was Lorentzian.\nthese operators is \u000f0 = 2 + 2n. The D+ derivatives are essentially taken into account by the\nmomentum quantum number, related to the R\u03c3 .\nNow let us see what happens at two loops. At two loops, the particle starts feeling\nthe effects of the color electric flux between the two null lines. This flux breaks the SL(2)\nsymmetry. So, if we act with L\u22121 on the flux vacuum, we can create a particle, but only with\namplitude g, since the background flux F\u03bc\u03bd \u223c g 2 . In addition, the anomalous dimensions of\nthe n-th single particle descendent, Pn could be changed, to \u000f = 2 + 2n + g 2 \u03b3n + o(g 4 ) . It\nis possible to show that \u03b3n is still independent of n, so that we have\n\u000f = 2 + 2n + g 2 \u03b3(p) + o(g 4 ) ,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, * * *\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we noted that \u03b3 can depend on p, which is the quantum number under the translation\nR\u03c3 . This can be shown by starting with a single particle state Pn |0i. Acting with L\u22121\nwe get Pn+1 |0i + gPn P0 |0i, where the second term is a two particle state arising from the\n6\n\n\fnon-invariance of the vacuum. By acting with both sides of the commutator L\u22121 = [L0 , L\u22121 ]\non Pn |0i, we can show that \u03b3n should be independent of n.\nIt turns out that one can derive the same condition by demanding that the OPE expansion\nshould have the same form with different choices of reference square, see figure 3. It should\nhave the same form, but with different OPE coefficients.\n\nTwo loop polygonal Wilson loops in R1,1\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe Octagon\n\nIn this section we explain how to derive the octagon two loop remainder function up to an\noverall constant from the symmetries of the square together with the existence of the OPE\nlimit. We start by writing down the OPE expansion of the U (1) result (7),\n\u221e\n\nrUoctagon\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001 X\ng2\n= \u2212 log 1 + e\u22122\u03c4 log 1 + e\u22122\u03c3 =\n2\nk=1\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\ndp Ck (p) eip\u03c3\u22122k\u03c4 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe expansion (9) is a sum over twist 2k particles in the free theory where their energy\n(1)\nis quantized and equal to 2k. The constants Ck represent the amplitude for creating and\nannihilating these particles on the top and bottom parts of the octagon. They are the one\n(1)\nloop form factors or structure constants. We could of course compute Ck (p) by a simple\nFourier transform2 however we will not need to know their precise expressions. It suffices to\nnotice that the k dependence is very simple, since we are expanding log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 ),3\n(1)\n\nCk (p) =\n\n(\u22121)k (1)\nC (p)\nk\n\n(10)\n\nWe can now move to two loops. At two loops a few things change. On the one hand the\nsingle particle form factors get corrected. On the other hand the single particle energies get\nan anomalous dimension of order g 2 . This second contribution gives a term linear in \u03c4 of\nthe form\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\u0001\n(\u22121)k \u22122k\u03c4\noctagon\n4\nr 2 loops linear in \u03c4 = \u2212g \u03c4\ne\ndp C (1) (p) eip\u03c3 \u03b3k (p)\n(11)\nk\nk=1\nwhich comes from expanding the exponential e\u2212\u03c4 \u000fk in powers of g 2 and using (8). According\nto (8) the anomalous dimensions \u03b3k (p) is actually independent of k at this loop order. Hence\nwe have\n\u0001\n4\n\u22122\u03c4\nr 2octagon\n)f (\u03c3) .\n(12)\nloops linear in \u03c4 = \u2212g \u03c4 log(1 + e\n2\n\n(1)\n\nWe would get Ck (p) = g 2 (\u22121)k /(4kp sinh(\u03c0p/2)) and the integral over p in (9) should be understood\nas going slightly above the real axis.\n3\nThe function log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 ) is nothing but the SL(2) conformal block for a dimension 1 primary. This\nis what we should expect given the discussion of the previous section. Therefore, to a certain extent we do\nnot even need the U (1) result for this argument.\n\n7\n\n\fAt this point, we should in principle compute the anomalous dimension \u03b3(p) and compute the\nfunction f (\u03c3). There is an intuitive shortcut to the correct result. The remainder function\nR, is a cyclic invariant function and therefore \u03c4 \u2194 \u2212\u03c4 symmetric. At two loop, its term\nlinear in \u03c4 is given by (12). This allows us to make the following simple guess for the full \u03c4\ndependence\ng4\nlog(1 + e2\u03c4 ) log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 )f (\u03c3)\n(13)\nR 2octagon\n=\n\u2212\nloops\n2\nMoreover, R is parity invariant and therefore \u03c4 \u2194 \u03c3 symmetric. Now we use that symmetry\nto get f (\u03c3),\nR 2octagon\nloops = \u2212\n\ng4\nlog(1 + e2\u03c4 ) log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 ) log(1 + e2\u03c3 ) log(1 + e\u22122\u03c3 )\n2\n\n(14)\n\nis agreement with [2]. The argument we presented, however, does not fix the overall multiplicative constant in (14).\nTo do that, we need an honest computation of \u03b3(p). It is however easy to see that the\nnormalization we picked is the correct one: Fourier-transforming f (\u03c3) from (14) we can read\nthe dimension of the twist 2k fields,\n\u000fk (p) = 2k + 2g 2 [\u03c8(1 + ip) + \u03c8(1 \u2212 ip) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)] ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c8(u) = (log \u0393)0 (u). The normalization of the g 2 term in the dispersion relation is\ndirectly connected to the normalization of (14). Since we can compute (15) independently\nusing N = 4 integrability we can fix the normalization of (14) 4 , see appendix B for details.\nIt is rather simple to compute f (\u03c3) from the anomalous dimension (15): the fact that\nthe anomalous dimension is diagonal in momentum space implies that in position space it\nacts as a convolution kernel. By Fourier transforming (15) we find that the logarithmic term\nof the two loop octagon is\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\n[2R1 (\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2212 R1 (\u03c4, \u03c3 + t/2) \u2212 R1 (\u03c4, \u03c3 \u2212 t/2)]\noctagon\n2\n(16)\nR 2 loops linear in \u03c4 = \u2212\u03c4 g\ndt\net \u2212 1\n0\n= \u2212\n\ng4\n\u03c4 log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 ) log(1 + e\u22122\u03c3 ) log(1 + e2\u03c3 )\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere R1 is the one loop answer (9). Symmetrizing we get to (14).\nThese arguments allow extra terms with an OPE expansion without linear terms at large\n(positive or negative) \u03c4 or \u03c3. A simple example of one such term is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n\u03c0 log 1 +\nlog 1 +\n.\n(18)\ncosh 2\u03c4\ncosh 2\u03c3\nThis term respects the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u03c4 , \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3 and \u03c4 \u2194 \u03c3 symmetries of the square and has an\nOPE expansion without linear terms.

In this particular case we could\ndiscard it since it has extra singularities when \u03c4 = \u00b1\u03c0/4, \u00b13\u03c0/4 etc, which should not be\nthere. It would be interesting to understand in more generality to which extent is N = 4\nOPE constructible.\nIn fact, the OPE is very similar to looking at particular physical cut contributions in\namplitudes. It would be interesting to find a precise relation.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Decagon\n\nIn this section we use the same technique to derive the Decagon two loops remainder function.\nThe generalization to any even n > 10 is given in Appendix A. We start by gauge fixing the\ndecagon cusps to be at\n+\nx+\ni = {\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03c71 , \u2212\n\nx\u2212\ni\n\n\u03c7+\n1\n, 0, 1}\n1 + \u03c7+\n2\n\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n1\n2\n= {\u2212\u221e, \u2212\n\u2212 , \u2212 \u2212 , 0, 1} .\n\u03c71\n\u03c71\n\n9\n\n(19)\n\n\fThe cusps are located as in (5). A corresponding basis of four conformal cross ratios is\n\u03c7+\n1 =\n\n+\nx+\n5,1 x4,2\n+ ,\nx+\n4,5 x1,2\n\n\u03c7+\n2 =\n\n+\nx+\n4,1 x3,2\n+ ,\nx+\n3,4 x1,2\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n1 =\n\n\u2212\nx\u2212\n1,3 x5,4\n\u2212\nx\u2212\n5,1 x3,4\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n2 =\n\n\u2212\nx\u2212\n4,1 x3,2\n\u2212\nx\u2212\n3,4 x1,2\n\n(20)\n\nAny OPE limit corresponds to a choice of two non adjacent edges in the x+ or x\u2212 directions.\nFor the Decagon there are ten different such choices, i.e. ten different OPE limits. These\nlimits are all related by the symmetries of the Decagon which reshuffle the cross ratios. These\nsymmetries are parity, which reflects the sign of time, and cyclicity, which cyclicly permutes\nthe labeling of the x+ and x\u2212 points. Combining these two we get a Z10 transformation that\nacts on the cusps points as\n+\n\u2212\nx\u2212\nx+\n(21)\ni \u2192 xi+1 ,\ni \u2192 xi .\nUnder this transformation we have5\n\u03c7+\n1\n\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n2\n,\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c71\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n1\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c7+\n1\n\n\u03c7+\n2\n\n,\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n2\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n2\n\n1 + \u03c7+\n1\n\u2192\n.\n\u2212\n\u03c71\n\n(23)\n\nWe will now construct two loops Decagon OPE expansion in one channel. Demanding\nthe answer to be Z10 symmetric will guaranty the correct OPE limit in all other channels.\nThe U(1) part. We choose the two null lines for the OPE expansion to be in the x\u00b1\ndirections and located at x+ = 0 and x+ = \u221e. As before, we choose the reference square\ncusps on these lines to be located at x\u2212 = 0 and x\u2212 = \u221e (see figure 4). For that choice,\n\u22122\u03c4\n\u22122\u03c3\nthe OPE expansion parameter is \u03c7\u2212\n, whereas \u03c7+\n. The U (1) result in that\n1 = e\n1 = e\nchannel is read from the one loop amplitude as explained in section 2. It is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003 g2\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7+\ng2\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+\nlog 1 + \u03c71 \u2212 log 1 + \u03c71 log 1 +\n(24)\nrU (1) = \u2212 log 1 +\n2\n2\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n1 + \u03c7+\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c7\u2212\ng2\n\u03c7+\n1\n1\n+ log 1 +\nlog 1 +\n+ [terms independent of \u03c4 ] .\n2\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n1 + \u03c7+\n2\n2\nTo see that, note that the Decagon can be decomposed into three Octagons as in the bottom\nof figure 4. Since the U (1) part is linear, it decomposes into a sum over these three Octagons\ncorresponding to the three terms in (24). The same applies to any n > 8 (see Appendix A).\nThe OPE procedure. The expression (24) is written as a sum over three terms, each\nof the form of the Octagon U (1) part with shifted \u03c4 and \u03c3. That is, each term has the form\nZ\n\u221e\n\u0001\n\u0001 X\n\u0001\ndp e\u2212ip(\u03c3+b/2)\n\u22122\u03c4 +a\n\u22122\u03c3+b\n\u22122\u03c4 +a k 1\n(25)\nlog 1 + e\nlog 1 + e\n=\n\u2212e\nk\n2(p \u2212 i0) sinh(\u03c0p/2 \u2212 i0)\nk=1\n5\n\nThe best way to find how that transformation acts on the conformal cross ratios (20) is to map them to\n[a]\n[a+1]\nthe Y functions of [9]. The reason is that (21) has a simple action on these cross ratios given by Ys \u2192 Ys\n.\n[a+10]\n[a]\nFor the Decagon Y0 = Y3 = 0 and Ys\n= Ys . The translation between the Y functions and the cross\nratios (20) can be read from [9] and is given by\n[1]\n\n\u03c7+\n1 = Y1\n\n[6]\n\n= Y2 ,\n\n[5]\n\n\u03c7+\n2 = Y2 = Y1 ,\n[a+1]\n\n[5]\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n1 = Y1 = Y2 ,\n\n[a\u22121]\n\n[a]\n\n[1]\n\n\u03c7\u2212\n2 = Y2\n[a]\n\n[6]\n\n= Y1\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nWe can then use the Y system equations Ys\nYs\n= (1 + Ys+1 )(1 + Ys+1 ) to map all the Y functions\ngenerated by the Z10 action to the ones appearing in (22). Using these equations one finds that (21) acts on\nthe cross ratios (20) as (23). This procedure generalizes immediately for larger number of edges.\n\n10\n\n\fAs for the Octagon, we identify the terms e\u22122k\u03c4 in the sum with the exchange of the twist\n2k one particle state. At two loops, that term will give rise to a term linear in \u03c4 obtained\nby dressing the previous expression by\n\u2212\u03c4 \u03b31 (p) = \u22122\u03c4 g 2 [\u03c8(1 + ip/2) + \u03c8(1 \u2212 ip/2) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)] .\n\n(26)\n\nWe conclude that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nlog 1 + e\u22122\u03c4 +a log 1 + e\u22122\u03c3+b \u2212\u2212\u2192 2g 2 \u03c4 log 1 + e\u22122\u03c4 +a log 1 + e\u22122\u03c3+b log 1 + e2\u03c3\u2212b (27)\nOPE\n\nBy appling (27) to the three terms in the U (1) part (24), we find the part of the two loop\nremainder function which is linear in \u03c4 :\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u2212\u0003\n\u0002\ng4\n\u03c7\u2212\n1\n(2)\n1\n+\nRlinear in \u03c4 =\nlog \u03c71 log 1 +\nlog 1 + \u03c71 log 1 + +\n(28)\n2\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n\u03c71\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0002 \u2212\u0003\ng4\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7+\n1 + \u03c7+\n1\n1\n2\n\u2212 log \u03c71 log 1 +\nlog 1 +\nlog 1 +\n2\n1 + \u03c7\u2212\n1 + \u03c7+\n\u03c7+\n2\n2\n1\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n+\n+\n4\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 + \u03c72\ng\n\u03c71\n\u2212\n+ log \u03c7\u2212\n1 log 1 + \u03c71 log 1 +\n+ log 1 +\n2\n1 + \u03c72\n\u03c7+\n1\nSymmetrization. This expression is not invariant under the Z10 symmetry and therefore\ncannot be the full result. We should now proceed like in the octagon case. I.e. we should first\n\u2212\n\u2212\nreplace log(\u03c7\u2212\n1 ) by some function which behaves as log(\u03c71 ) when \u03c71 \u2192 0. Next we should\nsymmetrize the result over the Z10 action. Now, in general, this symmetrization will spoil the\nOPE expansion (28). The idea of the bootstrap program is to look for a replacement which\n\u2212\npreserves (28). Remarkably, the simple replacement log(\u03c7\u2212\n1 ) \u2192 \u2212 log(1+1/\u03c71 ) does the job!\nOf course, by construction, the remainder function obtained in this way is Z10 symmetric.\nWe therefore arrive at the following expression for the two loop Decagon remainder function6\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 +\n\u0015\n\u0014 +\n\u0015\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7\u2212\n(\u03c71 + 1)(\u03c7+\n(\u03c71 + 1)(\u03c7+\ng4\n2\n1\n2 + 1)\n2 + 1)\n+ 1 log \u2212\n+ 1 log\nlog\nR2 loop = \u2212 log \u2212\n+\n+\n2\n\u03c71 + 1\n\u03c72 + 1\n\u03c7+\n\u03c7+\n1 \u03c72\n1 + \u03c72 + 1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u2212\n\u0015\n\u0014 +\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng4\n1\n(\u03c71 + 1)(\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c71 + 1\n\u03c7+\n2 + 1)\n2\nlog\n+ 1 log +\n+1\n(29)\n\u2212 log \u2212 + 1 log\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c72\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7+\n\u03c71 + 1\n1 + \u03c72 + 1\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u2212\n\u0015\n\u0014 +\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(\u03c71 + 1)(\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c71 + \u03c7+\n\u03c7+\ng4\n1\n2 +1\n2 + 1)\n1\nlog\n+1\nlog +\n\u2212 log \u2212 + 1 log\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c71\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7+\n\u03c72 + 1\n1 + \u03c72 + 1\n1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u0002 +\n\u03c7\u2212\ng4\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 log \u2212 + 1 log + + 1 log \u03c71 + 1 log \u2212\n+1\n2\n\u03c71\n\u03c71\n\u03c72 + 1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u2212\n\u0015\n\u0002 +\n\u0003\ng4\n1\n1\n\u03c71 + \u03c7\u2212\n2 +1\n\u2212 log \u2212 + 1 log + + 1 log \u03c72 + 1 log\n.\n2\n\u03c72\n\u03c72\n\u03c7\u2212\n1 +1\nwhich is compatible with the OPE expansion in all possible channels.

In Appendix A we generalize this result for n > 10.\n\n3.3\n\nGeneral gauge theories\n\nIn the above results we have only used the symmetries of the problem. Thus, we expect\nsuch results to be valid in any conformal gauge theory with a weak coupling limit. It is also\neasy to understand from diagramatic point of view why the results are valid for any planar\nconformal gauge theory at two loops. Consider all the two loop diagrams. Many of the\ndiagrams involve only gauge bosons and are the same in all theories. The one diagram that\nis different is the bubble correction to the propagator. Such a diagram contains a piece with\ngauge bosons and a piece that involves a matter loop. The theory is a gauge theory coupled\nto matter in such a way that it leads to a CFT with a tunable coupling, with zero beta\nfunction (by assumption). The matter theory has an global symmetry that we are gauging.\nLet us call j the corresponding currents. We have a current two point function hjji \u223c k/r6 .\nThe condition that the \u03b2 function vanishes is the condition that the constant k has the value\nit has for the matter in N = 4 SYM. Thus the diagrams involving the matter bubble have\nthe same value that they would have in N = 4 SYM. This argument also appears to work\nfor non-planar gauge theories (at two loops). In this case we have different diagrams, but\nonly involving gauge fields.\nIt would be interesting to investigate a similar argument for the case of three dimensional\nconformal field theories, such as ABJM [10].\n\n4\n\nRemarks on the three loop octagon\n\nWe can attempt to extend this method to the computation of the octagon Wilson loop at\nthree loops, still in R1,1 kinematics. One difficulty is that at two loops we might be able to\ncreate propagating states consisting of two particles. Let us ignore this issue and let us first\nfocus on one part of the answer which only involves the propagation of one particle states.\nAt two loops we obtained the part of the two loop answer that goes like \u03c4 F2 (\u03c4, \u03c3), where\nF2 has an expansion in powers of e\u22122\u03c4 . This was computed by convolving the anomalous\ndimension kernel with the one loop result, see (16). At three loops we can easily obtain\nthe piece that goes like \u03c4 2 F3 (\u03c4, \u03c3). We simply need to convolve twice with the anomalous\ndimension kernel appearing in (16). We obtain\n\u03c42\n(\u2212\u03c4 )2\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 R1 = (2g 2 )2 g 2 log(1 + e\u22122\u03c4 )f3 (\u03c3)\n2\n2\n4\n2\u03c3\nf3 (\u03c3) = \u22122Li3 (\u2212e ) + 2\u03c3Li2 (\u2212e2\u03c3 ) \u2212 log3 (1 + e2\u03c3 )+\n3\n2\n\u03c0\n+4\u03c3 log2 (1 + e2\u03c3 ) \u2212 (2\u03c3 2 + ) log(1 + e2\u03c3 )\n6\n\n\u03c4 2 F3 (\u03c4, \u03c3) =\n\n(30)\n\nEven though it is not manifest, we have that f3 (\u03c3) = f3 (\u2212\u03c3). If we now symmetrize this\n12\n\n\funder \u03c4 \u2194 \u03c3 we obtain\nR3part \u221d g 6 f3 (\u03c4 )f3 (\u03c3)\n\n(31)\n\nAs we take \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e we get the right \u03c4 2 terms, in agreement with (30). One could wonder\nif (31) is the full answer or not. If one assumes that the three loop answer factorizes into\na function of \u03c4 and a function of \u03c3, then (31) is the only consistent answer. In fact, if we\nassume that the answer factorizes at all loop orders, then one can determine it using the\nsame method. However, we do not know any reason why it should factorize. And the strong\ncoupling answer [11] appears inconsistent with this factorization hypothesis. This does not\nsay at what loop order factorization would stop. There is another potential problem with\n(31). We can consider the term linear in \u03c4 . The guess (31) gives a very specific term linear\nin \u03c4 . On the other hand the OPE analysis gives two sources for terms linear in \u03c4 . We\nhave one loop corrections to the OPE coefficients and two loop corrections of the anomalous\ndimensions. The latter on its own gives a term which has a rather different structure, being\nof transcendentality two in \u03c4 and four in \u03c3. However, we have not computed in detail the\ncorrections to the OPE coefficients. This correction could involve the creation of two particle\nstates and we have not fully analyzed it. We leave this to the future. The conclusion is that\nprobably (31) is just a part of the three loop answer, which correctly captures the full \u03c4 2\nbehavior, but by some miraculous cancelations it could be the full answer.\n\n5\n\nConclusions and open problems\n\nIn this paper we have provided a quick derivation of the two loop result for polygonal Wilson\nloops in R1,1 kinematics. It is based on an important feature of the OPE expansion of the\ntwo loop results: the terms which have a logarithmic discontinuity around the factorization\nlocus can be predicted from the OPE expansion of the one loop result. The idea is to start\nfrom the known result for the one loop Wilson loops. This is a simple function which is\njust the result that we would obtain in a U (1) theory. We then apply the Operator Product\nExpansion for Wilson loops derived in [1]. One selects a particular expansion channel and\nthe structure of the OPE, together with the knowledge of the anomalous dimensions, allows\nus to derive certain logarithmic terms in the two loop result. They are the discontinuity\nof the two loop answer around the factorization locus. One then guesses a simple way to\ncomplete these terms into a full expression. When we select an expansion channel we break\nthe cyclic symmetry. Imposing the cyclic symmetry gives us a natural way to complete the\nanswer into the full expression. In this way we rederived the two loop octagon expression\n(14), derived originally in [2]. We have extended these results for higher number of gluons.\nThese expressions were guessed previously in [4]. Their approach was different. They just\nassumed a form for the functions that could appear in the answer and then imposed the\ncorrect colinear limits, which would be the zeroth order term in the OPE. In fact, if one\nknows the functions that appear in the answer, then one can find the right combination by\nlooking at simple limits. On the other hand, the OPE, can be good for determining, or at\nleast constraining the functions that appear. In this case with R1,1 kinematics the OPE gives\nus the functions that appear in the answer.\nIt is natural to try to extend this two loop analysis to the full R1,3 kinematics. In principle,\n13\n\n\fthe same method works. In practice, it is more complicated because there is a large number\nof SL(2) primaries that appears. In the case of R1,1 kinematics, we had simply one tower\nof primaries which are simply plus and minus derivatives of F\u2212+ . In the R1,3 case we have\nprimaries of the form Dzl F+z and Dz\u0304l F+z\u0304 , where z and z\u0304 are the transverse coordinates. The\nl index is related to powers of one of the extra angular coordinates that we have when we\ndo the OPE in the R1,3 context. However, we also have primaries of the form Dzl F\u2212z and\nDz\u0304l F\u2212z\u0304 . When we perform the expansion of the one loop answer, we need to separate the\ncontribution from these two sets of primaries. We leave this to the future.\nWe can also consider higher loop contributions. The leading logarithmic terms are easy\nto obtain, one simply repeats the convolution with the one loop anomalous dimension kernel\nonce again. For R1,1 kinematics we wrote an expression which reproduced all the \u03c4 2 (and\n\u03c3 2 ) terms in the OPE at three loops. It remains to be seen if there are other terms that we\nshould add to that expression in order to reproduce the full answer. In principle, we can also\nget subleading logarithmic terms. These arise from higher loop corrections to the anomalous\ndimensions, which we can compute, and also from corrections to the OPE coefficients. These\nare harder to compute since they might involve multiparticle states, etc. In short, it would\nbe great to gain analytic control over the breaking of the SL(2) symmetry discussed in the\ntext. This seems to be the main missing link to be able to extend our techniques to any\nloop order. Of course, if one restricts to the lowest terms in the OPE, which only receive\ncontributions from single particle exchanges, then it is easy to go to higher loops once one\nknows the lower loop answers, as explained in [1].\nRecently the full N = 4 all loop integrand was proposed in a remarkable Yangian invariant\nform [12]. It would be interesting to see if the OPE limit can be applied directly at this level.\nAlso, it was recently understood how to generalize the bosonic null Wilson loops into super\nloops which are dual to amplitudes with arbitrary polatizations [13, 14]. It would be very\ninteresting to apply the method we described to compute non MHV scattering amplitudes.\nIn these cases, fermionc excitations of the flux tube will also be excited. Another connection\nwhich would be interesting to work out concerns the relation between the OPE expansion\nand the high energy Reggee limit of scattering amplitudes. They seem to be closely related.\nThe recent papers [15] seem to be a promising starting point for establishing a more precise\nconnection.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank F. Alday, N. Arkani-Hamed, B.

As for the octagon and decagon,\nwe start from the U (1) contribution and use the knowledge of the one loop energy (15) to\nobtain the terms linear in \u03c4 in all channels. We will then show that the guess of [4] is the\nsimplest solution that is consistent with all the OPE expansion in all channels.\nConsider a n = 2m null polygon in R1,1 . An OPE channel in the x+ direction is defined\nby splitting the cusps points x+\ni into two groups of ordered points, top and bottom. We denote\n+\n+\n+\n+\nthese by (x1 , xi+1 , . . . , xs ) and (x+\ns+1 , . . . , xm ) respectively, see figure 5. The locations of top\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nand bottom cusps in the x direction are (x\u2212\nm , x1 , . . . , xs ) and (xs , . . . , xm ). We chose the\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nreference square cusps to be at (x+\ns , xs ), (xm , xm ), (xs , xm ) and (xm , xs ).\nTo obtain the U (1) contribution in this channel we decompose the n-gon contour as a\nsum of octagons as we did at the bottom of figure 4. The cusp of the octagons are denoted\nby A, . . . , H, see figure 6 for an example. In this decomposition all octagons share the two\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ncusps of the reference square A = (x+\nm , xm ) and E = (xs , xs ). Each octagon also shares one\nmore cusp from the top group\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nC \u2208 {(x+\n1 , x1 ), (x2 , x1 ), (x2 , x2 ), . . . , (xs\u22121 , xs\u22122 ), (xs\u22121 , xs\u22121 )}\n\n15\n\n(32)\n\n\fB\n\nD\n\nC\n\nA\n\nF\n\nH\n\nx+\nE\n\nG\n\nA\n\nx-\n\nFigure 6: Example of a Null Wilson loop (thick dark blue line) together with a reference\nsquare (dashed red line) and one of the octagons (thin light blue line). The points A and E\nare cusps of the reference square. Points C and G are points of the top and bottom part of\nthe polygon respectively. As depicted in this figure, the points B, D, F, H are automatically\nfixed given these four points.\nand one more cusp from the bottom group\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nG \u2208 {(x+\ns+1 , xs+1 ), (xs+2 , xs+1 ), . . . , (xm\u22121 , xm\u22121 )}\n\n(33)\n\nSo far we described four of the eight cusps of each octagon. It is easy to see that the four\nremaining cusps are uniquely fixed once these points are chosen, see figure 6 for illustration.\nAlthough we will not explicitly use them in what follows, their positions are\nB = (C + , A\u2212 ) ,\n\nD = (E + , C \u2212 ) ,\n\nF = (G+ , E \u2212 ) ,\n\nH = (A+ , G\u2212 ) .\n\n(34)\n\nWe have therefore a unique decomposition given by a sum over the points C and G (all\nother points are fixed in terms of these). The sign of each octagon is determined from its\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\norientation and is given by (\u22121)(c \u2212c )+(g \u2212g ) where c+ stands for the index appearing in\nC + , i.e. C + = x+\nc+ etc. To summarize, the U (1) part in that channel is given by\n(1,s)\n\nRU (1) = \u2212\n\u00b1\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng2 X\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n(\u22121)c \u2212c +g \u2212g log 1 + YGAEC\nlog 1 + YGEAC\n.\n2 C,G\n\u00b1\n\n(35)\n\n\u00b1\n\n(A \u2212B )(C \u2212D )\n\u00b1\n+\n\u2212\n\u22122\u03c4\nwhere YABCD\n\u2261 (A\nand YGEAC\n\u221d e\u22122\u03c3 .

To guess this function it is useful to notice that the sum over C and G can\nbe partially performed. First we notice that\n+\nYGAEC\n\n+\n+\n+\n(x+\ng + \u2212 xm )(xs \u2212 xc+ )\n\n+\n+\n+\n(x+\ng + \u2212 xc+ )(xs \u2212 xm )\n\n+\nx+\ng + ,c+ xs,m\n\n\u2261 + +\n(37)\n+\n+\n+\n(x+\nxg+ ,s xc+ ,m\ng + \u2212 xs )(xc+ \u2212 xm )\ni\nP\nP hP\n(.\n.\n.)\nand similar for G.\nNext notice that, from (32), we have C (. . . ) = c\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nc =c ,c +1\n\u2212\nWe should be slightly more careful with the boundary terms, e.g. when c = s \u2212 1 we only\nhave one allowed value for c+ , namely c+ = s \u2212 1, see (32). In other words, the sums over\nc+ and g + are rather trivial as they contain either two or one terms. E.g.,\n!\n!\n\u2212 +1 g \u2212 +1\n+\n+\n+\ncX\n+\nX\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ns,m\ng ,c\ng +1,c +1 g ,c\n(\u22121)c \u2212c +g \u2212g log\n= log\n(38)\n+\n+\n+\n+\nx\nx\nx\ng + ,s c+ ,m\ng \u2212 +1,c\u2212 xg \u2212 +1,c\u2212\n+\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n1+\n\nc =c\n\n=1+\n\n+\n+\n+\n(x+\ng + \u2212 xs )(xc+ \u2212 xm )\n\n=\n\ng =g\n\nwhich is valid away from the boundaries, i.e. for c\u2212 < m \u2212 1 and g \u2212 < s \u2212 1. At the\nboundaries, if g \u2212 = m \u2212 1 we have\n!\n!\n\u2212 +1\n+\n+\n+\ncX\n+\nx\nx\nx\nx\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ns,m\ng ,c\ng +1,c +1 g ,c\n= log\n(\u22121)(c \u2212c ) log\n(39)\n+\n+\n+\n+\nx\nx\nx\nx\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\ng +1,c\ng ,s c ,m\ng +1,c\n+\n\u2212\nc =c\n\nwith a similar expression for c\u2212 = s \u2212 1. Results (38) and (39) are quite interesting in the\nsense that they involve the logs of nearest-neighborhood cross-ratios, the indices s and m\ndropped out completely. These building blocks posses a very useful property:\n!\n+\nx+\nx\na+1,b+1 a,b\nlog\n+\nx+\na+1,b xa,b+1\ngives rise to a linear \u03c4 behavior if and only if a = s and b = m or viceversa. We can use this\nto write a cyclically symmetric sum which reproduces the \u03c4 -linear part in the large \u03c4 limit:\n!\n!\n!\n!\n+\n+\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n+\nX\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx+\nx\ng4\na+1,c+1 a,c\nb+1,d+1 b,d\na,d b,c\na,b d,c\nlog\nlog\nlog 1 + \u2212 \u2212 log 1 + \u2212 \u2212\n.\n+\n+\n+\n8 a,b,c,d in cyclic order\nx+\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\na+1,c a,c+1\nb+1,d b,d+1\na,b c,d\na,d xb,c\nAlthough it is not manifest, this expression is symmetric in exchanging x+ and x\u2212 . Indeed,\nit is simply the result of a telescopic sum over x\u2212 of the expression guessed in [4], thus\nshowing that it satisfies the \u03c4 -linear part of the OPE requirement in all possible channels\nand is therefore the simplest and most natural solution.\n\nB\n\nExcitations from Integrability\n\nIn this appendix we compute the anomalous dimensions of the flux tube excitations using\nintegrability. More precisely we will use the mapping of the flux tube to the GKP state\nZ D+ . . . D+ Z + . . .\n| {z }\nS\n\n17\n\n(40)\n\n\fand study the energy of fluctuations around that state. Here D+ is a light-cone direction\nand Z is one of the complex scalars of the theory which need to be included so that the\nderivatives have something to act on. We can think of the scalars as being two fast particles\nsourcing the flux tube represented by the light-cone derivatives. The spin S is to be taken to\ninfinity as explained shortly. This formula is of course schematic, the state is a complicated\nsuperposition as indicated by the dots and an overall trace is omitted.\nWe are interested in excitations\nZD+ . . . \u03c7 . . . D+ Z + . . .\n\n(41)\n\nmoving in the background of derivatives. The effective length perceived by these excitations\nis 2 log S. The energy of this state is given by\nX\nE = 2\u03b3cusp log S + C +\n\u000f\u03c7 (p\u03c7 )\n(42)\nexcitations \u03c7\n\nwhere p\u03c7 is the momentum of the excitation and \u000f\u03c7 (p) is the dispersion relation of the\nexcitation \u03c7. The first term represents the vacuum energy contribution and C is an irrelevant\nconstant, also associated to the vacuum. There are several different excitations we could\nconsider. In this appendix we will consider scalars, fermions and, most relevant for this\npaper, the case when\nk\n\u03c7 = D\u2212\nF+\u2212 .\n(43)\nThis is the most relevant case since excitations of the form (43) are the ones that we expect\nto generate in the OPE Wilson loop when considering loops in R1,1 as in this paper. Of\ncourse the detailed structure of the Bethe state with excitations (43) is quite complicated\nsince it will mix with fermions and scalars. For us what is important is that is has the correct\nquantum numbers to be created by the polygon Wilson loops. For the bulk of the text, the\nmain result is that these excitations have a one loop energy given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u0010\np\u0011\np\u0011\n+\u03c8 1\u2212i\n\u2212 2\u03c8(1) + O(g 4 ) .\n(44)\n\u000fD\u2212k F+\u2212 (p) = 2 + 2k + 2g 2 \u03c8 1 + i\n2\n2\nExcitations of the GKP string were considered in much greater detail by Benjamin Basso\nin [16] who provided all loop expressions for most excitations. In this appendix we will\nconsider mostly one loop and will mainly focus on the excitations needed for the main text.\nWe will also use the method of Baxter polynomials which is very suitable for perturbative\nweak coupling computations.\n\nB.1\n\nScalars Z at one loop\n\nTo construct the state with a single scalar \u03c7 = Z moving in the see of derivatives as in (41)\nwe use Beisert-Staudacher (BS) Bethe equations [17]. For completeness these equations are\nwritten down in section B.5. The precise notation is introduced in that section.\nThese equations describe excitations around the Z L vacuum. From this point of view the\nexcitations are the light-cone derivatives while the vacuum is made out of scalars. In other\n18\n\n\fwords, (41) is an extremely excited state. Luckily there is a way of efficiently exchanging\nparticles and vacuum constituents in Integrable models via what is called a particle-hole\ntransformation. This can be nicely implemented using the Baxter polynomial approach as\nproposed in the AdS/CF T context in [18]. We will follow this approach in what follows.\nTo build (41) we consider BS equations with S momentum carrying excitations (the\nderivatives) and L = 3 (the scalars). At one loop the relevant Bethe equations are equivalent\nto the Baxter TQ relation\nT (u)Q4 (u) = \u03a6(u + i/2)Q4 (u + i) + \u03a6(u \u2212 i/2)Q4 (u \u2212 i)\nwhere \u03a6(u) = uL with L = 3, Q4 (u) =\n\nQS\n\nk=1 (u\n\n(45)\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212 uj ) and\n\nK\u03b8\nY\nT (u) = 2 (u \u2212 \u03b8j ) .\n\n(46)\n\nj=1\n\nThe zeros of T (u) are called holes. The index 4 comes from a conventional labeling of the\nBethe roots in the BS equations, see section B.5. Since T (u) is a polynomial, the left hand\n(4)\nside of (45) vanishes for u = uj which coincides precisely with Beisert-Staudacher equations\nwhen only Z's and D+ 's are present in the single trace operator. Note that for (45) to make\nsense we must have\nK\u03b8 = 3 .\n(47)\n(4)\n\nThe idea is to trade the dynamics of the S particles uj by the dynamics of the 3 holes \u03b8j .\nActually, as explained in section B.4, two of these holes are located at\nS\n\u03b8 ' \u00b1\u221a\n2\n\n(48)\n\nand do not have therefore any interesting dynamics. They are the so called large holes.\nThis result is valid for any coupling, with any finite number of excitations with arbitrary\npolarizations. The remaining hole is the interesting one, the small hole. It corresponds to\nthe excitation \u03c7 = Z moving in the vacuum. The goal is then to find the momentum and\nenergy of this holes, pZ (\u03b8) and \u000fZ (\u03b8) to derive \u000fZ (p).\nAt values of u with positive imaginary part the first term in the right hand side of (45) is\nway bigger than the second one which can therefore be dropped7 . The resulting functional\nequation is then easy to solve [18],\n\u0010\n\u0011\nu\u2212\u03b8j\n3\nY \u0393\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nfor u in the upper half plane ,\n(49)\nQ4 (u) = c 2u/i\nu+i/2\nj=1 \u0393\ni\nwhere c is a constant which is irrelevant for our argument. For negative imaginary values\nof u we would drop instead the first term in the right hand side of (45) and we would get\nthe complex conjugate function. We can now compute the energy and momentum of the\nexcitation.\n7\n\nThis is so for |u| \u001c S which is more than enough for our purposes\n\n19\n\n\fThe energy of the state is given by (74). When taking the logarithm of Q4 , the product\nin (49) becomes a sum of three terms. Two of them are associated to the large holes (48)\nand gives us the vacuum energy contribution, containing a term proportional to log S plus a\nconstant. The remaining term gives us the energy of the excitation. More precisely, we find\n(42) with \u03b3cusp = 4g 2 + O(g 4 ) and [18]\n\u000fZ (\u03b8) = 2g 2 (\u03c8(1/2 + i\u03b8) + \u03c8(1/2 \u2212 i\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)) + O(g 4 ) ,\n\n(50)\n\nThe momentum is read off from the effective Bethe equation for the hole excitations. These\nare nothing but\n\u03a6+ Q++\n4\n= \u22121\n,\nat u=\u03b8j\n(51)\n\u03a6\u2212 Q\u2212\u2212\n4\nwhere f \u00b1 \u2261 f (u \u00b1 i/2), f ++ \u2261 f (u + i) etc. This is of course the definition of the holes.\nWhen plugging (49) into this equation, the left hand side will contain a factor of the form\ne\u2212ipZ (\u03b8)\u00d72 log S generated by the large holes in (49). From this term we read off the momentum\npZ (\u03b8) (recall that the effective length of the operator is 2 log S). In other words,\nQ4 (\u03b8 + i)\ni\nlog\n.\nS\u2192\u221e 2 log S\nQ4 (\u03b8 \u2212 i)\n\npZ (\u03b8) = lim\nWe find\n\npZ (\u03b8) = 2\u03b8 + O(g 2 ) .\n\n(52)\n\nCombining this result with (53) we arrive at the known result\n\u000fZ (p) = 2g 2 (\u03c8(1/2 + ip/2) + \u03c8(1/2 \u2212 ip/2) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)) + O(g 4 ) .\n\nB.2\n\n(53)\n\nOther excitations\n\nTo consider other excitations in Beisert-Staudacher equations associated with the Dynkin\n(a)\ndiagram of figure 9, we also need to consider the auxiliary roots uj for a 6= 4. The Baxter\nequation (45) for the momentum carrying roots is now replaced by\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\u2212 + +\nT Q4 = \u03a6+ Q++\n4 Q3 Q5 + \u03a6 Q4 Q3 Q5\n\n(54)\n\nwhere T (u) is given by (46) with K\u03b8 = L + K3 + K5 . The excitations u(3) and u(5) are\nfermionic excitations. Note that when u is in the upper half plane the first term in (54)\n(a)\ndominates exponentially over the second one. However, when u ' uj + i/2 with a = 3, 5\nthis term is suppressed by Q\u2212\na . This means that, with exponential precision, there is a\n(a)\ncomplex zero of T (u) for each fermionic root located at uj + i/2. Similarly, there is another\n(a)\nhole at uj \u2212 i/2.\n(3)\n\n(5)\n\nThere is an important exception: the case when two roots of type uj and uj are in\nthe same position v. In this case we also have the possibility of having one hole at v + i/2\nand one hole at v \u2212 i/2 instead of two holes at v + i/2 and two holes v \u2212 i/2, as one can\nconclude after a simple inspection of (54). Hence, from now on, we shall use vj to denote the\n20\n\n\f(3)\n\nroots uj = u(5) in this particular case, i.e. the which are at the same position and which\n(3)\n(5)\nare accompanied by only two holes at vj \u00b1 i/2. At the same time we shall use uj and uj\nto denote the remaining roots of type 3 and 5. Then,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 Y\nY\nS2\n1\n2\n2\nT (u) = 2 u \u2212\n(u \u2212 z) +\n(u \u2212 z)\n(55)\n2\n4\n(3)\n(5)\nz={\u03b8j }\n\nz\u2208{vj }\u222a{uj }\u222a{uj }\n\nwhere \u03b8j are real small holes like the one studied in the previous section which are not bound\nto any fermionic roots. Now, as before, we can solve the functional equation (54) by going\nto the upper half plane and using simple functional identities of Gamma functions. We find\nQ4 (u) = c exp (\u22122ui log S)\n\n+\n1\n+ + qv\nq\nq\nq\n\u03b8 3 5\n\u03c6+\nqv\u2212\n\n,\n\nfor u in the upper half plane\n\n(56)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = \u0393(u/i)L and\nqa \u2261\n\nNa\nY\n\n(a)\n\n\u0393\n\nj=1\n\nu \u2212 uj\ni\n\n!\n.\n\n(57)\n\nNote that Q4 vanishes for u = v + i/2 which means that there is a complex root u4 at this\nposition. Similarly from the expression for Q4 (u) in the lower half plane we conclude that\nthere is another root u4 at v \u2212 i/2. Figure 7 summarizes the three possibilities we found so\nfar: single real hole, fermionic excitation dressed by two complex holes and double fermionic\ncomposite dressed by two complex holes and two complex momentum carrying roots. In this\npicture we only represent the holes and the particles u(a) with a = 3, 4, 5. All other auxiliary\nroots don't couple directly to the momentum carrying roots u(4) and hence carry no energy\nnor momentum at this loop order. When considering two loops and higher we would need\nto consider the energy of excitations u(1) and u(7) as well.\nWe can now use again (74) to read of the energy in the presence of all possible excitations.\nWe find\nX\nX\nE \u2212 Evacuum =\n\u000f\u03c8 (z) +\n\u000fZ (z) ,\n(58)\n(3)\n\n(5)\n\nz\u2208{uj }\u222a{uj }\n\nz\u2208{\u03b8j }\n\nwhere (53) and the energy of u(3) and u(5) excitations are given by\n\u000f\u03c8 (\u03b8) = 2g 2 (\u03c8(1 + i\u03b8) + \u03c8(1 \u2212 i\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)) + O(g 4 ) .\n\n(59)\n\nNote that the excitations vj carry no energy at all!, they are not present in (58). We can\nnow compute the momentum of the several excitations. The momentum is read off from the\nterm eip(\u03b8)2 log S arising in the corresponding Bethe equation in (75). For composite states\nwe should multiply the corresponding equations as usual. Plugging the corresponding Q4\ngiven by (56) in (75) we read the momentum of these fluctuations as before. For u(3) and\nu(5) excitations we find again\np\u03c8 (\u03b8) = 2\u03b8 + O(g 2 )\n(60)\nwhile the v excitations have carry no momentum,\npv (\u03b8) = 0 + O(g 2 ) .\n21\n\n(61)\n\n\fi\ni/2\n\n-i/2\n-i\n\n\ufffd\n\n(3)\n\n(5)\n\nu\n\nu\n\nV\n\nFigure 7: Fundamental building blocks using the holes and the fermionic roots u(3) and u(5) . White\nballs represent holes; Blue balls correspond to fermionic roots u(3) ; Red balls indicate fermionic roots\nu(5) ; Green balls denote complex momentum carrying roots u(4) . The energy of the first building\nblock (the single hole) is given by (53) while the energy of the fermionic excitations in the middle is\ngiven by (62). The last composite, to the right, is isotopic to all loop orders [16] and hence carries\nno energy or momentum.\n\nIn sum we found\n\u000f\u03c8 (p) = 2g 2 [\u03c8(1 + ip/2) + \u03c8(1 \u2212 ip/2) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)] .\n\n(62)\n\nUsing these results we can derive the dispersion relation of several different excitations. First,\nconsider the excitation associated with a single root u(3) . An excitation of this type carries\nthe quantum numbers of c4 b1 , see figure 9. This bilinear converts\nD+ Z \u2194 D11\u0307 \u03a643 \u2194 b\u20201 a\u20201\u0307 c\u20204 c\u20203 |0i\n\n(63)\n\ninto a twist one fermionic excitation\n\u03a81\u03073 \u2194 a\u20201\u0307 c\u20203 |0i\nHence we derived that\n\u000f\u03c8 twist one (p) = 2g 2 [\u03c8(1 + ip/2) + \u03c8(1 \u2212 ip/2) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)] .\n\n(64)\n\nSuppose we added a bosonic root u(2) to this excitation. This would amount to acting with\nthe oscillators c3 c\u20204 which would convert the R-charge index 3 of the fermion into a 4. This\nwould be another fermionic twist one excitation. Since u(2) excitations do not carry energy\nor momentum this excitation would have the same anomalous dimension which is of course\nwhat we expect.\nLets now consider a real hole \u03b8 together with a composite of type v described above. As\nwe saw the v composite carries no momentum or energy at all. There is a simple reason [16]8\nfor this which becomes clear when we identify the excitation using the oscillator picture. By\nadding one root u(3) and one root u(5) we convert the scalar excitation Z = \u03a643 into another\n8\n\nWe thank Benjamin Basso for illuminating discussions on this point.

The excitation D\u2212\n12\nj\nj\nIt has therefore the exact same energy and momentum. The state (43) is nothing but the linear\nk F + D k \u1e1e\ncombination D\u2212\n12\n\u2212 1\u03072\u0307 and therefore it has the same energy as either of these states. Now,\nat one loop, only the first constituent in this figure \u2013 the single root u(3) \u2013 carries energy and\nmomentum! All other excitations are isotopic. Hence (44) follows.\n\nscalar excitation Y = \u03a632 . The v composite is an isotopic degree of freedom responsible for\nimplementing the SO(6) symmetry of the GKP vacuum! This is why it has zero energy and\nmomentum as we checked at one loop order. Of course, from this symmetry argument the\nv composite ought to have zero energy and momentum at any loop order and it does indeed\n[16].\nFinally we could consider more complicateds excitation such as (43). It is described by\nseveral roots of all possible kinds, see figure 8. However, we see that only a single fermionic\n(1)\nroot carries energy at one loop order. Hence (44) follows. At higher loops the roots uj and\n(7)\nuj are no longer isotopic in this vacuum. Thus the state (43) no longer has a reasonable\ndescription in terms of a single particle state; instead it decays into several excitations (e.g.\nfermions).\nNow, this result is part of a much more general observation which is that at one loop the\nroots u(1) and u(7) are isotopic and hence there is an isotopic symmetry enhancement which\nwill be broken at higher loops when these particles become momentum and energy carrying.\nThis symmetry contains the SL(2, R) symmetry mentioned in the main text. It implies that\nthe one loop spectrum is organized according to SL(2, R) primaries and descendents. For\nk\nk\nexample, all excitations D\u2212\n\u03c8 (or D\u2212\nX) have the same anomalous dimension because the\npattern of Bethe roots associated to this excitation is just the Bethe roots of \u03c8 (or X) plus\na bunch of isotopic roots as in figure 8. At higher loops the roots u(1) and u(7) start carrying\nenergy and momentum and all these degeneracies are lifted.\n\n23\n\n\fOne loop Summary\nWe have found that the one loop dispersion relation for excitations around the flux tube is\nalways of the form\n\u000fs (p) = 2g 2 [\u03c8(s/2 + ip/2) + \u03c8(s/2 \u2212 ip/2) \u2212 2\u03c8(1)] ,\nwhere s = S + \u2206 is the conformal spin of the excitation.

We will illustrate how to perform this computation at 2 loop order but\nthe generalization to higher loops can be done along the same lines. For all loop results see\n[16].

Up to wrapping order\ng 2L , the right hand side of this equation is a polynomial in u which allows us to define a\npolynomial T (u) thus simplifying the computations. This justifies the splitting of terms\nbetween the displayed terms and those in \"c.c.\". Now we proceed as before. For a very\nsimilar computation see [19]. For positive imaginary part of u we can drop the \"c.c.\" terms\nin (65) and find\n#\n\"\nX\nQ4 (u)\n(0)\n2\n+\n\u2202u log Qa\n\u03c8( 12 \u2212 iu) + O(g 4 ) , (66)\n= 1 + g i L \u2202u + 2\u2202u log Q4\n(0)\nu=i/2\nu=0\nQ4 (u)\na odd\n(0)\n\nwhere Q4 (u) is given by (56). As before, the energy of the several excitations can then be\nextracted from (74) while their momentum is identified by looking at the term proportional\nto 2 log S in the (logarithm of) the corresponding Bethe equation.

Consider\n\nT (u)\n\u2261 2 cos p(u)\nQ3 (u)Q5 (u)\u03a6(u)\n\n(70)\n\nat large values of u \u223c S. For example, at one loop we have, see (54),\nK\n\nS\n\nK\n\n3\n5\nL X\n1\n1X\n1X\n1\n1\np(u) =\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(4)\n(3)\n2u j=1 u \u2212 uj\n2 j=1 u \u2212 uj\n2 j=1 u \u2212 u(5)\nj\n\n(71)\n\nThe precise form of this expression is not very relevant (e.g. at higher loops this\nexpression is modified but its form as a sum of poles still holds and the argument that\nfollows goes through untouched).\nFor u ' S the roots are well described by a density and the function p(u) develops\ntwo large cuts (one for positive u and another for negative u). The real part of p(u)\non these curs coincides with the (logarithm of the) Bethe equations in the scaling limit\nand is therefore equal to the mode number of the corresponding roots. For the GKP\nground state, it equals \u03c0 (\u2212\u03c0) for positive (negative) u. For even larger u's, i.e. after\nthe cut, the function p(u) decays to zero. Between p(u) = \u03c0 and p(u) \u2192 0 there is\nonly one value where cos p(u) vanishes which is of course p(u) = \u03c0/2. Thus there is\nonly one large hole for positive u. Similarly there is only one large hole for negative u.\n2. At large u we have\nT (u) = u\n\nL+K3 +K5\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt4\nt2\n2 + 2 + 4 + ...\nu\nu\n\n(72)\n\nwhere\nt2 = S 2 + O(S) .\n\n(73)\n\nThis follows trivially from expanding (54) at large u. Now, the existence of only two\nlarge holes proved above implies that t2k /u2k \u001c t2 /u2 for k > 1. Thus, for large u,\nwe have T (u) \u221d 2u2 \u2212 S 2 so that\u221athe two large holes, which are the two large zeros of\nT (u), are indeed located at \u00b1S/ 2.9\n9\n\nIt is also fun to note that at the end of the cut we have p(u) = \u03c0 which means 2 +\nu ' S/2 which is indeed the known value for the end of the large cuts.\n\n25\n\nt2\nu2\n\n' \u22122 yielding\n\n\fFigure 9: Beisert-Staudacher Dynkin diagram and corresponding oscillators.\n\nB.5\n\nThe N = 4 Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\n\nIn N = 4 SYM single trace words are made out of letters which can be written using bilinears\nof oscillators such as\n\u03a6ab \u2194 c\u2020a c\u2020b |0i , D\u03b1\u0307\u03b2 \u2194 a\u2020\u03b1\u0307 b\u2020\u03b2 |0i , F\u03b1\u03b2 \u2194 b\u2020\u03b1 b\u2020\u03b2 |0i , \u1e1e\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 \u2194 a\u2020\u03b1\u0307 a\u2020\u03b2\u0307 |0i , \u03a8a\u03b1 \u2194 c\u2020a b\u2020\u03b1 |0i , etc .\nThe oscillators can have SU (2)\u00d7SU (2) Lorentz indices (a\u2020\u03b1\u0307 and b\u2020\u03b1 ) or SU (4) R-charge index\n(c\u2020a ).
