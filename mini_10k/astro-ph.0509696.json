The\nauthors designated the two lobes of this system shells A (the northeastern shell) and B (to\nthe southwest); following this and subsequent work, we shall use the same designations.\nMathewson et al. (1983) confirmed that the DEM L 316 system had the optical, radio, and\nX-ray characteristics typical of SNRs. A multi-wavelength study by Williams et al. (1997)\nconcluded that the most probable scenario for DEM L 316's unique morphology was that it\nconsisted of a pair of colliding SNRs. Evidence cited in support of this scenario included\na change in radio polarization between the two shells, the kinematics of the two shells,\nmultiwavelength morphological features and similar extinctions.\nAlternate scenarios for the physical association of the two shells include (a) that the\nshells are the result of a single explosion into a bi-lobed cavity, or (b) that the shells are\nisolated SNRs apparently juxtaposed along the line of sight, but in fact spatially separated.\nNishiuchi et al. (2001), using a study of combined ROSAT and ASCA X-ray data, noted\nthat the shells were spectrally distinct to an extent which would rule out the single-explosion\nscenario, and also concluded that, on the basis of its enhanced iron abundance, Shell A was\nprobably the result of a Type Ia SN.\nIn this paper, we present new Chandra observations of DEM L 316. These observations\nallow us, for the first time, to spatially resolve the structure of the DEM L 316 remnants,\nwith reasonable spectral resolution over smaller regions. We supplement these data with\nXMM-Newton observations, which allow us to more reliably determine X-ray spectra for\nlarger regions. \u00a72 describes our observations, while \u00a73 contains our analysis. A discussion of\nthe implications of our findings is given in \u00a74, and those findings are summarized in \u00a75.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed DEM L 316 with the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS)\nS3 back-illuminated chip (sequence number 500279, observation 2829, 40 ks). Data were\nreprocessed following procedures recommended by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC): we\nremoved the afterglow correction, generated a new bad pixel file, and applied corrections\nfor charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) and time-dependent gain for an instrument temperature of -120 C. We also applied background cleaning using the 5\u00d75 pixel islands of our\nVFAINT mode observation. The dataset was filtered for high-background times and poor\nevent grades, resulting in a total \"good time\" interval of 35.6 ks, and restricted to the energy\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nrange of 0.3-8.0 keV, where the S3 chip is most sensitive.\nSpectral results were extracted from the new event file. Background regions were taken\nfrom source-free areas surrounding the SNRs, and the spectra of these background regions\nwere scaled and subtracted from the source spectra. Individual spectra for regions of interest\n(Table 1), and the corresponding primary and auxiliary response files, were extracted with\nthe ciao acisspec script and analyzed in xspec. Spectra were rebinned by spectral energy\nto achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in each bin.\nRegions within DEM L 316 were chosen to examine specific morphological features seen\nin our X-ray images (Figure 1 and Table 1). Regions 1 and 2 enclose the approximate X-ray\nboundaries of Shell A and Shell B, respectively. Region 3 covers the bright central emission\nwithin Shell A, while Region 4 includes the limb of Shell A, excluding that central emission.\nRegions 5-7 cover brighter X-ray \"arcs\" to the north, east, and south of Shell A; Region 8\nsamples emission between those arcs. In Shell B, Region 9 encloses the central emission from\nthe remnant, and Region 10 covers a particularly bright knot of interior emission. Region\n11 incorporates the ring-like structure of brighter emission in Shell B, including the bright\nknot of Region 10. Region 12 covers emission on the limb of Shell B, excluding the center\nand the ring.\nTo augment our spectral data for Shells A and B (Regions 1 and 2) we used XMMNewton EPIC MOS and pn data from observation ID 0201030101, with exposure times\nof 11.2 ks (MOS1 and MOS2 detectors) and 7.0 ks (pn detector). The pipeline-processed\ndata obtained from the Science Operations Centre (SOC) were reduced using the Science\nAnalysis Software package provided by the SOC. The data were filtered for poor event grades.\nSpectra for spatial regions corresponding to Regions 1 and 2 in the Chandra observations, and\nsurrounding background regions, were extracted from the filtered event files and rebinned\nto a minimum of 25 counts per bin. Joint fits were performed in xspec to the data from\nChandra's ACIS and the XMM-Newton instruments.\nFor comparison, we utilized optical emission-line (H\u03b1, [S II], [O III]) images taken with\nthe Curtis-Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), and radio\nimages from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 4.4 and 6.0 GHz (7 and 5\ncm). The angular resolution of the CTIO images was about 1.\u2032\u2032 5; the half-power beamwidth\nof the radio images was 12\u2032\u2032 . Other details of these observations are given in Williams et al.\n(1997).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nX-ray Morphologies\n\nPrevious X-ray analyses have noted a separation between the X-ray emission from the\nshells of DEM L 316. In the Chandra ACIS data, we indeed see two distinct shells; any\noverlap is too close to background levels to constitute a significant detection. Although\ndiffuse emission between the shells is seen in the XMM-Newton observations, this emission is\nfaint (\u223c 2\u03c3 above the background with the EPIC pn); in addition, the SNRs are over 7\u2032 offaxis, and so the spatial resolution may be insufficient to distinguish betwen the boundaries\nof the two SNRs.\nThree-color images comparing the Chandra morphology to emission in H\u03b1, [O III],\nand 7 cm radio (Williams et al. 1997) are shown in Figure 2a-c. In general, the brightest\nregions of X-ray emission appear to correspond to areas that are fainter at radio wavelengths.\nConversely, the X-rays grow fainter toward the radio-bright limbs. Similarly, the X-ray\nemission appears well-confined by the optical filaments along the limbs of both shells. In\nShell A, some filaments across the face of the SNR appear to correspond roughly to regions\nof fainter X-ray emission, but there is no strong anticorrelation.\nShell A appears to have a bright ring of inner emission, as well as bright \"arcs\" extending\nradially outward from that ring. As noted by Williams et al. (1997), the peak of the Xray emission, now seen as the edge of this bright ring, corresponds to the location where\noptical filaments (particularly well seen in [O III]) from Shell B overlap with Shell A. The\nsouthwestern side of the SNR is flattened somewhat toward Shell B, and appears slightly\nbrighter on the flattened side. Notably, this flattening occurs just north of the apparent\noverlap between the two shells, running parallel to the optical filaments and radio-bright\nlimb there.\nThe faint, outermost emission from Shell B is irregular, and is elongated in the E-W\ndirection. The primary source of this elongation seems to be an extension on the western\nside, which is matched by similar extensions in the optical and radio. The X-ray emission of\nShell B is distributed over the face of the remnant, out to the boundary defined by the thick\nannulus of the radio structure. Corresponding to the inner radius of this radio annulus, there\nappears to be a brighter ring of X-ray emission, though this is not as prominent as that in\nShell A. A bright X-ray knot is visible on the north side of this ring. Curiously, this knot is\ndirectly north of a \"small-diameter source\" noted in radio images by Williams et al. (1997).\nTo examine the morphology as a function of energy, we created a three-color image (Figure 2d) with emission divided into energy bands of 0.3-0.8 keV (soft), 0.8-1.5 keV (medium),\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand 1.5-8.0 keV (hard). The middle band was selected to show the contribution from the\nblend of Fe L lines that dominate the X-ray emission in this energy range, though it should\nbe noted that other lines such as the helium-like blends of Ne and Mg also contribute to\nthis band. The overall structure is similar in all three bands. Emission from Shell A shows\nconsiderably more medium-band emission than does Shell B; in particular, the central ring\nof Shell A is bright at these energies. In contrast, the X-ray Bright Knot in Shell B appears\nbrightest in the hard band. A similar three-color map using the XMM-Newton data reproduces these primary features at lower angular resolution: the medium band is much brighter\nin Shell A than in Shell B; and the location of the X-ray knot in Shell B is brighter in the\nhard band than is any other portion of either remnant.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectral Fits\n\nWe fit non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) plane-parallel shock models (\"vpshock\" in\nxspec)1, modified by photoelectric absorption, to determine the plasma parameters for\neach spatially-selected region. The model parameters are the mean shock temperature kT ,\nionization timescale (\u03c4 =ne tion ), elemental abundances (given as fractions of the solar abundance values of Anders & Grevesse 1989), and a normalization A proportional to the distance\nR\nand volume emission measure (A(cm\u22125 ) = 10\u221214 ne nH dV /4\u03c0D 2). Here, ne is the electron\ndensity, nH the hydrogen density, tion the shock age (time since the earliest material was\nshocked), V the volume occupied by the hot gas, and D the distance, all in cgs units.\n\n3.2.1. Overall characteristics of the two shells\nWe extracted spectra from regions covering all of Shell A and all of Shell B (Table 1,\nRegions 1-2) from both the Chandra and XMM-Newton data. Spectra from the various\ninstruments were fit jointly. The fitted spectral parameters are given in Table 2. It was not\npossible to obtain a statistically acceptable fit (at or above the 90% confidence level) to both\nshell spectra with the same model parameters.\nThe fitted absorption column densities were 3.6\u00b10.6 \u00d7 1021 H-atom cm\u22122 for Shell A,\nand 2.2 \u00b10.5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 for Shell B under a range of model combinations. Fits to Chandra\ndata alone, however, gave absorption columns of 3.4\u00b10.2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 for both remnants.\n1\n\nDetails and references for the vpshock model can be found at\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/manual/node40.html.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThe value obtained from joint fits for Shell B is similar to that of 2.0\u20132.5 \u00d71021 cm\u22122\nestimated from fits to ROSAT data by Williams et al. (1997), although the value for Shell A\nis somewhat higher. The Shell A value, however, is reasonably consistent with the estimate\nof 3.8\u00d71021 cm\u22122 that those authors determined using H I data for the LMC (Rohlfs et al.\n1984) and a Galactic foreground of 5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 (Schwering & Israel 1991). Data from a\nmore recent H I survey of the LMC gives a higher figure of 6.2\u00d71021 cm\u22122 (Staveley-Smith\net al. 2003; Kim et al. 2003) toward DEM L 316, which when added to the aforementioned\nGalactic foreground gives a total absorption column of 6.7\u00d71021 cm\u22122 . Note that the H I\nestimates include contributions from gas behind DEM L 316. Conversely, contributions to\nX-ray absorption from, e.g., molecular gas will not be accounted for in H I.\nShell A is well fit by a single vpshock component with high iron abundance. Acceptable\nfits could be achieved with iron abundances between 1 and 5 times solar values; in all cases,\nsubstantially above the mean LMC abundance for iron. The Mg and Si He-like line blends\nare prominent in the spectrum, and fitted abundances for Mg, Si and S were well above\ntypical values for the LMC ISM. The best-fit model yields an absorbed 0.3\u22128.0 keV flux of\n6\u00b12\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , an unabsorbed flux of 2\u00b11\u00d710\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and a luminosity of\n3\u00b12 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 . The upper limit on an additional power-law component is an absorbed\nflux of 1\u00d710\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , or 1.7% of the total flux; inclusion of such a component,\nhowever, does not improve the fit.\nFor Shell B, a model with a single vpshock component provides only a poor fit. A\nsubstantial improvement in the fit is possible by using two components - either a combination\nof vpshock and power-law models or two vpshock models with the same abundances. For\nexample, an F-test between the single vpshock model and a combined vpshock and powerlaw model gave only a 10\u221213 probability of no improvement in the fit. The combination\ngives acceptable fits for values of the photon index \u0393 in the 1.6-1.8 range, within the typical\nrange of photon indices for pulsar-wind nebulae in SNRs (Gotthelf 2003). Fits to Shell B\ndo not require abundance fractions much above the LMC mean values. Models including an\niron abundance of 1.0 solar or above could be ruled out at the 90% confidence level. The\n0.3-8 keV flux for this model is 8\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (2\u00d710\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 unabsorbed),\nimplying a luminosity of 3\u00d71035 erg s\u22121 . The power-law component takes up \u223c30% of the\nabsorbed flux.\nThe two-plasma fit gives an ionization-equilibrium component with a temperature \u223c0.6\nkeV, and a non-equilibrium component with kT>3 keV. The fitted abundances are close\nto typical LMC abundances. The fluxes and luminosities for this model fit are the same,\nto one significant figure, as those for the combined plasma/power-law fit. In this case the\nhigh-temperature component accounts for \u223c50% of the flux.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.2. Regions within the SNR\nWe used the Chandra ACIS data to obtain spectra from smaller spatial regions within\nDEM L 316 (Figure 1). We fit the best-fit spectral model found for Shell A (\u00a73.2.1) to the\nvarious sub-regions within Shell A (Regions 3-8). For most regions (3-6,8) the emission did\nnot significantly deviate from this model, and a joint fit (with only normalizations varied)\nproduced statistically acceptable results. The exception was the S Arc region (Region 7),\nalong the \"flattened\" side of the SNR. Emission from this region had an excess of soft\nemission when compared to the best-fit model for Shell A, and the joint fit to Shell A and\nthe S Arc was poor. If we assume the abundances to be the same for this region as for Shell\nA generally, the S Arc region requires a slightly higher temperature (kT\u223c1.5) and lower\nionization parameter for a good fit.\nSimilarly, we used the two-plasma fit to Shell B (\u00a73.2.1) to perform joint fits with Shell B\nand its sub-regions (Regions 9-12). All of these regions were well described by the overall twoplasma-component Shell B fit, although the relative normalizations of the two components\ndiffer. The high temperature component accounted for > 70% of the unabsorbed flux for\nthe Bright Knot (Region 10), \u223c40% of the flux for the Center Ring (Region 11) and < 30%\nof the flux in the Limb and Faint Center (Regions 9 and 12).\nWe attempted to obtain additional information from these spatially resolved regions by\nfitting their spectra individually. To reduce the number of free parameters, we fixed the\nabsorption column density to the mean value of 3.4\u00d71021 cm\u22122 found from fits to Chandra\ndata for both shells, and fixed all plasma abundances except iron to 30% of their solar values.\nGiven the low number of counts in most regions, it is unsurprising that the fits are highly\nuncertain, as seen from the broad errors on each fitted parameter.\nFor all of these regions, a simple power-law fit alone could be ruled out at or above the\n90% confidence level. The best power-law fit, though still not statistically acceptable, was\nto the data from the Bright Knot region of Shell B (Table 1, Region 10). As with Shell B\noverall, an acceptable fit to the Bright Knot region could be obtained with a combination of\nplasma and power-law, or two plasma models at different temperatures.\nBroadly, the spectra of various regions within Shell A are quite similar. The temperatures are consistently within the range of 0.9-1.2 keV, and the fitted iron abundance within\nthe range of 1.0-1.7 times solar values. The discrepancy between our fitted values for Fe\nabundance in the entire Shell A and sub-sections of this shell appears to be due to the difference in fitting procedure. For Shell A itself, we allowed Mg, Si, S and Fe to vary, while\nfor the sub-regions we only allowed Fe to vary. When we fix all abundances except Fe at\n0.3 for Shell A, we obtain Fe abundances of 1.7\u00b10.2 solar. Allowing the S abundance, for\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nexample, to vary freely leads to a significant improvement of the fit (F-test probability for no\nimprovement of 0.08) and a larger Fe abundance. The greatest differences between spectral\nfits to the various regions appear to be in the ionization timescale \u03c4 , which is lower in regions\nalong the remnant limb than toward the center. If we assume that most of the bright X-ray\nemitting gas is recently shocked, this would imply an increase in density toward the bright\ncentral region.\nFor Shell B, the temperatures of the best-fit model combinations are generally in the\n0.6-0.8 keV range, with iron abundances less than 40% of solar values. The bright ring of\nemission (Region 11) is set apart from other areas of Shell B in requiring a high temperature\nor a second spectral component to provide an acceptable fit. The knot of emission embedded\nin this ring (Region 10) is also better described with the addition of a second spectral\ncomponent, but the number of counts in this region is insufficient to distinguish between\none- and two-component models at a high level of significance.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPhysical Properties of the SNRs\n\nWe analyzed the overall emission from these SNRs, to determine abundance ratios between key elements within the SNRs; compare our findings with those previously made using\nASCA and ROSAT instruments; and refine our estimates of the physical properties of the\nSNRs based on the Chandra and XMM-Newton results.\n\n4.1.1. Abundances and SNR Types\nOur findings confirm the striking difference, first analyzed by Nishiuchi et al. (2001),\nbetween the spectra of the two shells of DEM L 316. Model fits to the spectrum for Shell\nA require an iron abundance significantly higher than that typical for the LMC, while no\nsuch condition is required for (or indeed permitted by) the spectrum of Shell B. The iron\nabundance found for Shell A, of three times solar abundances, is somewhat higher than the\nvalue of \u223c1.9 solar found by Nishiuchi et al. (2001). However, as discussed in \u00a73.2.2, we can\nattribute this difference to the differing methods of spectral analysis. The fits of Nishiuchi\net al. (2001) fixed all elemental abundances except Ne and/or Fe to the mean LMC values of\n0.3 solar. When we use the same procedure in fitting the spectrum of Shell A, the fitted Fe\nabundances of 1.7\u00b10.2 solar are within the error range of the Nishiuchi et al. (2001) value.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe abundances found for Shell B are all well below the solar values, and in many cases\nnear the typical LMC values (Russel & Dopita 1992). Our values for the iron abundance in\nthe entire Shell B, and for sub-sections of this shell, all fall within the range of 0.16-0.4 solar.\nNishiuchi et al. (2001) did not fit the Fe value directly for this shell, but noted that a fit with\na fixed Fe abundance of 0.3 solar provided a reasonable spectral fit. These low abundance\nvalues suggest that the SNR is dominated by emission from swept-up material. However,\nthe fitted values for O and Ne are sufficiently above their LMC values, even considering the\nlarge error ranges, to suggest that ejecta contributions to the spectrum remain significant\nfor some elements. This case is far from unique, as ejecta enrichment is still detectable in\nother middle-aged LMC SNRs (e.g., Hendrick, Borkowski, & Reynolds 2003).\nThe relative contribution of the lines from iron (compared with such elements as oxygen and neon) to the X-ray spectrum of a SNR is frequently used to discriminate between\nremnants resulting from Type Ia versus Type II supernovae (e.g., Hendrick, Borkowski, &\nReynolds 2003; Nishiuchi et al. 2001; Hughes et al. 1995). Theoretical models (e.g., Badenes\net al. 2003; Iwamoto et al. 1999) of Type Ia SNe and their remnants predict substantially\nhigher ratios of Fe to other elements than those seen in remnants of Type II SNe (e.g.,\nIwamoto et al. 1999; Nomoto et al. 1997). A comparison of the ratios derived from Shells A\nand B to ratios from SN models is shown in Table 5.\nUsing the abundances determined from the joint Chandra and XMM-Newton fits (Table 2) we find an overall O/Fe ratio of \u223c1.5, and an Ne/Fe ratio of \u223c0.2 for Shell A. Models\nof Type Ia nucleosynthesis yields from Iwamoto et al. (1999) give typical O/Fe ratios \u22641.0\nand Ne/Fe ratios \u22640.1. In contrast, modeled yields from Type II SNe from Nomoto et al.\n(1997), for progenitor masses of 15\u201340 M\u2299 , give O/Fe in the 8\u2013370 range and Ne/Fe in\nthe 0.6\u201330 range. Thus, the high iron abundance, particularly when contrasted with the\nless-enhanced Mg and Si, classes Shell A among LMC SNRs such as 0548-70.4 and 0534-69.9\n(Hendrick, Borkowski, & Reynolds 2003) and DEM L 71 (Hughes et al. 2003), which are tentatively categorized as remnants of Type Ia SNe due to high iron abundances. (Supporting\nthis categorization, SNR 0548-70.4 and DEM L 71 also have Balmer-line dominated optical\nemission, a classic signature of a Type Ia remnant.) We therefore agree with the conclusion\nof Nishiuchi et al. (2001) that Shell A is probably a remnant of a Type Ia SN.\nFor Shell B, depending on the model combination, the O/Fe ratios are in the range\n30\u2013130, and the Ne/Fe ratios in the range from 8\u201316. Typical ISM abundance ratios, based\non the LMC values of Russel & Dopita (1992), would give O/Fe of 13 and Ne/Fe of 2.4. The\nnotably higher ratios found in Shell B suggest that these abundances not simply those one\nwould expect from the swept-up interstellar gas, but are instead significantly enhanced by\nthe contributions from ejecta. The abundance ratios for Shell B are clearly within the ranges\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\npredicted for Type II SNe by the models of Nomoto et al. (1997). We therefore conclude\nthat Shell B is very likely to be the remnant of a Type II SN.\n\n4.1.2. Densities, Energies and Pressures\nThe fitted parameters for the NEI plane-shock spectral models can be used to derive a\nnumber of physical properties for the SNRs. For this purpose we assume that hydrogen and\nhelium are fully ionized, and that nHe /nH = 0.1; thus, the total particle density is about\n1.92ne . We assume each SNR to be an ellipsoid with the line-of-sight dimension equal to the\nlength of the minor axis, with volume V and hot gas volume filling factor fhot .\nThe spectrum of Shell A is reasonably consistent throughout the remnant, and can\nbe well described by a single spectral component. We therefore use the overall spectral\nfit to Shell A as the basis for our estimation of its physical properties. For Shell B, the\npicture is complicated by the likely presence of more than one spectral component, and\nby variations over the face of the remnant. To characterize the properties of its overall\nexpansion, therefore, we use the single-component spectral fit to the limb region (Region 12)\nas the basis for our calculations. From the normalization factor for a fitted spectrum, we\ncan estimate the electron density and mass of the hot gas by:\n\u22121/2\n\nne = 3.89 \u00d7 107 DA1/2 V \u22121/2 fhot\n\ncm\u22123\n\nMgas = 1.17ne mH V fhot g\nThe density and the plasma temperature (here given in keV) can be used to derive the\nthermal energy and pressure of the hot gas, according to:\nEth = 4.60 \u00d7 10\u22129 ne TkeV V fhot erg\n\nPth = 3.05 \u00d7 10\u22129 ne TkeV dyn cm\u22122\nOur derived values are summarized in Table 6, in terms of fhot where appropriate.\nQuoted errors are simply propagation of errors in fitted parameters and volumes, and do not\ntake into account uncertainties due to the choice of spectral models and filling factor.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe properties dependent on ne are affected by our choice of volume filling factor.\nFor spherical Sedov expansion, we expect fhot \u2248 0.25 (Sedov 1959). Using this value, we\nfind electron densities of 0.3\u00b10.1 cm\u22123 for Shell A, and 0.28\u00b10.03 cm\u22123 for Shell B. These\ndensities are consistent with the broad ranges found by Williams et al. (1997) from ROSAT\ndata. The electron density found for Shell A is also consistent, within the errors, with the\nion density (presumed equal to the electron density) found by Nishiuchi et al. (2001) from\nASCA spectra, although it should be noted that their derived density was based on a value of\nfhot = 1 for this shell. If we similarly presumed fhot = 1 to reflect the filled morphology, our\ndensity is only 0.2\u00b10.1 cm\u22123 for Shell A. For Shell B, the value we find from the SNR limb\nis somewhat lower than that found by Nishiuchi et al. (2001); this difference is unsurprising,\ngiven that their spectral fit covered the entire remnant.\nThe thermal energies for the hot gas, using fhot \u2248 0.25, are 1.5 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d71050 erg and\n2.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d71050 erg for Shells A and B, respectively. These values are also within the broad\nranges found by Williams et al. (1997). The pressures found with this filling factor are 1.4\n\u00b1 0.6 \u00d710\u22129 dyn cm\u22122 for Shell A and 6.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d710\u221210 dyn cm\u22122 for Shell B, somewhat\nhigher than the ROSAT-derived values. We attribute this to the higher temperature (or hightemperature component) found from Chandra and XMM-Newton data; it is unsurprising that\nROSAT, sensitive in the 0.2-2.4 keV range, would not have provided sufficient information\nat the high-energy end of the spectrum for accurate temperature determinations. (However,\nnote that a higher filling factor for Shell A can lower the presumed pressure.) Our findings\nreenforce the conclusion of Williams et al. (1997) that the hot gas thermal pressure exceeds\nthe sum of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure in the warm ionized gas seen in\noptical emission lines.\n\n4.2.\n\nSpatially Resolved Features of the Two SNRs\n4.2.1. Shell A\n\nShell A fulfills many of the criteria for a \"mixed morphology\" (also known as \"thermal\ncomposite\") SNR (Rho & Petre 1998): centrally brightened thermal X-ray emission, shelllike radio emission, and the absence of a prominent central compact source. The complex\ninternal X-ray morphology does not preclude this interpretation, as structures similar to the\ninner ring of emission in Shell A have been seen in other mixed morphology SNRs, such as\nKes 79 and HB 9 (Rho & Petre 1998).\nThe identification of Shell A as a Type Ia SN might initially appear to contradict the\nmixed morphology interpretation, as these SNRs are usually associated with massive-star\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nphenomena. Mixed morphology SNRs are often found in the vicinity of molecular clouds, as\nseen in their association with maser activity (e.g., Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2003). Several mixed\nmorphology SNRs also contain pulsars or PWN (e.g., Williams et al. 2005; Shelton, Kuntz,\n& Petre 2004; Rho et al. 1994). However, it is also not uncommon for SNRs from Type\nIa SNe to be seen in proximity to massive-star phenomena. For example, the LMC SNR\nN103B, which shows X-ray inferred abundances suggestive of a type Ia origin2 (Lewis et\nal. 2003; Hughes et al. 1995), is found at the periphery of H II region DEM L 84, within\n40 pc of the NGC 1850 superbubble (Chu & Kennicutt 1988). Although not itself a mixed\nmorphology SNR, N103B demonstrates that the association of many mixed morphology\nSNRs with massive-star phenomena does not rule out the possibility that such a SNR might\nhave a Type Ia origin.\nSpectra of resolved regions for Shell A are remarkably similar in temperatures and\nabundances. This isothermal structure is similar to that seen in Galactic mixed morphology\nremnants such as Kes 79 (e.g., Sun et al. 2004) and W44 (Shelton, Kuntz, & Petre 2004; Rho\net al. 1994). The lack of large temperature gradients across SNRs are often attributed to\nthermal conduction and/or turbulent mixing (e.g., Sun et al. 2004; Shelton, Kuntz, & Petre\n2004; Shelton et al. 1999). To see whether the former possibility is plausible, we examine\nthe timescale for thermal conduction (Sarazin 1988; Spitzer 1962):\n\u0010 n \u0011 \u0012 l \u00132 \u0012 kT \u0013\u22125/2 \u0012 ln \u039b \u0013\nkne l2\ne\ne\nttc \u2248\n= 16, 000 yr\n\u22123\nKs\n1 cm\n10 pc\n1 keV\n33\nwhere Ks is the Spitzer (1962) term for thermal conductivity (1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 T 5/2 / ln \u039b erg\ncm\u22121 s\u22121 K\u22121 ), and l the characteristic length scale for temperature variations (Te /|\u25bdTe |).\nThe Coulomb logarithm ln \u039b is given by\nln \u039b = 32.2 + ln\n\n\u0012\n\nn\u22121/2\ne\n\nkTe\n1 keV\n\n\u0013\n\nwhich is \u223c33 for our overall Shell A values of ne = 0.3 and Te \u2248 T = 1.4 keV. We\ncompare this estimate for the thermal conduction timescale (\u2264 16,000 yr) to estimated\nages for the SNR. Williams et al. (1997) suggest an age for Shell A of 27,000 yr, based\non expansion velocities measured from echelle spectroscopy, and assuming Sedov expansion.\nUsing the ionization timescale from X-ray spectral fits, Nishiuchi et al. (2001) estimated\na larger age of \u223c39,000 yr. If the presence of magnetic fields does not significantly hinder\nthermal conduction, then, it is reasonable to expect temperature equilibration over the SNR.\n2\n\nThis conclusion is disputed; see van der Heyden et al. (2002).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nOne of the primary factors that, it has been argued, may disrupt thermal conduction is\nthe tangling of the SNR's magnetic field by internal mixing. However, in that case, turbulent\nmixing (i.e. bulk motions in the gas) during the SNR's development could itself produce a\nfairly flat temperature profile (Cox et al. 1999; Shelton et al. 1999). In addition, one would\nexpect these motions to create greater uniformity in the distribution of elements and in the\nionization state of the gas. We would, therefore, still not expect dramatic spectral variations\nacross the SNR if turbulent mixing is a prominent influence.\n\n4.2.2. Shell B\nIn many respects, Shell B has the characteristics of an older remnant. The sub-solar\nmetal abundances indicate substantial contributions from swept-up material to the X-ray\nemission, although, as discussed in \u00a74.1.1, some ejecta contributions are still detectable. The\nlow surface brightness of the X-ray emission and relatively slow expansion velocity are also\nconsistent with this picture.\nAs with Shell A, Shell B has some of the characteristics of mixed-morphology SNRs:\nit is generally shell-type in radio, lacks a bright outer limb in the X-ray regime, and has\nsubstantial internal emission. However, the case for Shell B is not as clear-cut as for Shell A.\nThe surface brightness profile of Shell B is shallower than that of Shell A, and the interior\nemission is more patchy. The presence of multiple spectral components for Shell B, and the\nindication that these components may be due at least in part to spectral variations across\nthe remnant, are in marked contrast to the isothermal structure discussed above.\nThe spatially-resolved spectra indicate that the high-energy spectral component is most\nprominent within the Bright Knot of X-ray emission. Given its proximity to the \"small\ndiameter radio source\" mentioned in Williams et al. (1997), and the identification of Shell B\nas the result of a Type II SN, we must consider the possibility that the hard emission may\ncome from a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) embedded within the thermally-emitting shocked\nmaterial. The high-temperature component of its X-ray spectrum is certainly consistent\nwith the spectral properties of a PWN. However, the association of the X-ray knot with the\nradio source is uncertain, as the X-ray peak is offset from the radio peak by 13\u2032\u2032 , greater\nthan can be accounted for by the radio half-power beam width of 12\u2032\u2032 . A search of the\nX-ray power spectrum of the XMM-Newton EPIC pn data for that region shows no evidence\nfor periodicity in the emission; however, the low count rate of this source would make the\ndetection of any pulsations very unlikely.\nIn the absence of timing information or other indicators, and with the possibility re-\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nmaining that the high-energy emission could be thermal, we cannot rule out the possibility\nthat the Bright Knot emission may be simply a part of the remnant structure. For example,\na dense clump of swept-up ISM could have been incorporated into the interior of the SNR. If\nthis material were to evaporate into the hot cavity within the SNR, it could raise the surface\nbrightness of high-temperature gas shocked during more energetic phases of the SNR's expansion (e.g., White & Long 1991), and thus appear as a knot of higher-temperature X-ray\nemission.\n\n4.3.\n\nImplications for Collision Scenario\n\nSeveral scenarios have been put forward to explain the unusual bi-lobed morphology\nof DEM L 316. We can examine these scenarios in light of our new findings. As put forth\nby Nishiuchi et al. (2001), we can decisively rule out the hypothesis that this system is the\nresult of a single explosion into a bi-lobed cavity, on the basis of the wholly different heavy\nelement abundances found for the two shells. On the other hand, we certainly cannot rule\nout the possibility that the two SNRs are physically separate, and simply superposed along\nthe line of sight.\nWith regards to the central assertion of Williams et al. (1997) that DEM L 316 consists\nof a pair of colliding SNRs, the case for collision is weakened by the tentative conclusion\nthat Shell A is the remnant of a Type Ia SN and Shell B is the result of a Type II SN.\nThe explosions of two massive stars within the short lifetime of a SNR is conceivable if the\ntwo were members of a loose association, but if one SNR is the endpoint of the evolution of\na low-mass star, no such association can be established. Since the observable lifetime of a\nSNR is relatively short (e.g., Slavin & Cox 1992), the probability of two independent SNe\nfrom non-associated progenitors within that lifetime is low. Even if the SN Ia progenitor\nhad a main-sequence mass in the B-star range (Weidemann 1990), the required timescales\nfor stellar evolution to culminate in a Type Ia versus a Type II SN are sufficiently different\nto make the probability of collision between their SNRs quite low. Thus, such a collision\nmust be presumed to be a rare event, and the chances of observing it small.\nInterpretation of the X-ray morphology of the remnants remains ambiguous. Models of\nshock collisions often suggest that the hot cavities of two remnants undergoing a collision\nwill be eventually connected by a \"tunnel\" allowing hot gas to flow from one to another, but\nthis connection may not form until relatively late times compared to the SNR observable\nlifetimes (Bodenheimer et al. 1984; Jones et al. 1979; Ikeuchi 1978). Based on the clear\nspectral differences between the shells, we can eliminate the scenario whereby the hot cavities\nare interacting, although this leaves open the possibility of a collision observed before such a\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ntunnel has developed. In most cases the time between a SNR collision and the formation of\na tunnel will be relatively short, so the liklihood of observing a system in this state would be\nsmall. However, if the SNRs collide during the late (radiative) stage of their evolution, such\na tunnel may never form (Ikeuchi 1978). Such collisions would primarily be characterized\nby the dense \"wall\" of cool material along the interface between the SNRs. On the other\nhand, more recent laboratory and numerical simulations of colliding shocks (Vel\u00e1zquez et\nal. 2001) show that reflected shock waves from the collision of two shocks will push the\ncavities of hot shocked gas apart from one another, producing density structures reminiscent\nof the observed multiwavelength morphologies of DEM L 316. These reflected shocks would\nbe expected initially to produce X-ray emission in the ring of dense gas along the interface;\nhowever, the very high density expected in this region also leads to rapid cooling of the gas,\nwith a correspondingly rapid drop in the observable X-ray emission. In short, the Chandra\nobservations do not provide any new support for the colliding-SNR scenario, but the scenario\ncannot be conclusively ruled out on the basis of these data.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nChandra ACIS images and spectra, supplemented by XMM-Newton spectra, reveal new\ndetails of the DEM L 316 SNRs.\n1. Shell A exhibits a complex X-ray morphology, with a bright inner ring and \"arcs\" of\nbrighter emission embedded in an elliptical region of diffuse emission. The brightest\npart of this ring occurs near an overlapping optically-emitting filament from Shell B.\nThe non-limb-brightened X-ray structure is in marked contrast to the shell-like radio\nand optical morphologies, suggesting similarities to \"mixed morphology\" SNRs. As\nwith many mixed morphology SNRs, little temperature variation is seen across Shell\nA. We suggest that the favored explanations for such homogeneity in mixed morphology\nSNRs, thermal conduction and turbulent mixing, are also applicable to Shell A.\n2. Shell B also has its brightest emission in a ring-like structure well interior to the\nremnant limb. In particular, a small knot on this ring shows the brightest emission\nin the SNR. These regions are also spectrally distinct from the SNR limb, as they\nrequire the addition of a second, high-energy spectral component. The association of\nthis high-energy component with the X-ray knot suggests the presence of an embedded\npulsar-wind nebula, and its spectrum is consistent with this supposition, although we\ncannot rule out other possible explanations.\n3. We confirm the findings of Nishiuchi et al. (2001) that the spectrum of Shell A requires\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\na high iron abundance, and thus that this SNR likely resulted from a Type Ia SN. We\nare able to extend their work by explicitly fitting abundances for both shells, and\ncomparing abundance ratios to those predicted by models of Type Ia and Type II SNe.\nWe find that the O/Fe and Ne/Fe ratios for Shell A are consistent with a Type Ia\norigin, while those for Shell B are consistent with a Type II origin. In the latter case,\nthe observed ratios are significantly above those expected from swept-up ISM alone.\n4. The inferred physical properties of the hot gas are broadly typical of middle-aged\nSNRs. The relatively high thermal pressures in the hot gas for both SNRs emphasize\nthe continued importance of the hot interiors to the evolution of the remnants.\n5. The observed spectral differences between the SNRs strengthen the argument of Nishiuchi et al. (2001) that the shells are not part of a single bipolar SNR. We further\nobserve that the spectrally-based SNR classifications weakens the case for the SNRs\nto be colliding, although the evidence is still far from conclusive.\n\nThe authors thank the anonymous referee for comments which have helped to improve\nthis paper.
