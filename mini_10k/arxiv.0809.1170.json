The problem is that the dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the quantum system, and this in turn\ncauses an exponential growth in the amount of memory and CPU-time required to carry out\nthe simulation. This inefficiency is a major stumbling block for numerical studies aiming\nto determine the asymptotic performance of quantum algorithms. For example, numerical\nsimulation of the dynamics of the quantum adiabatic evolution (QAE) algorithm applied to\nthe NP-Complete problem Exact Cover 3 has been limited to systems containing N \u2264 20\nqubits1,2 . Because the algorithm dynamics must be adiabatic, its runtime T must satisfy\nthe inequality\nT \u226b\n\nM\n;\n\u22062\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nM = max hE1 (s)|\n0\u2264s\u22641\n\ndH(s)\n|E0 (s)i ;\nds\n\n\u2206 = min [E1 (s) \u2212 E0 (s)] ;\n0\u2264s\u22641\n\n(2)\n\nand here t is time; s = t/T is dimensionless time; H(s) is the time-dependent Hamiltonian\nthat drives the dynamics of the QAE algorithm; and {Ei (s), |Ei (s)i : i = 0, . . . , 2N \u2212 1}\nare the eigenvalues and eigenstates of H(s). In the usual formulation3,4,5 of QAE, dH(s)/ds\nis an s-independent matrix whose largest eigenvalue bounds M. Typically, this eigenvalue\nscales polynomially with N. Thus, if the minimum gap \u2206(N) separating the ground- and\nfirst-excited states scales polynomially (exponentially) with N, so will the algorithm runtime\nT (N). An efficient (inefficient) algorithm6 for a computational problem is one that solves\nall instances of the problem with polynomial (exponential) T (N). We see then that the\ncomputational efficiency of the QAE algorithm is largely determined by the scaling behavior\nof the minimum gap \u2206(N). Attempts to evaluate \u2206(N) using exact diagonalization7 have\nbeen limited to N \u2264 20 qubits. Recently, however, the minimum gap \u2206(N) for QAE applied\nto Exact Cover 3 has been determined for N \u2264 128 qubits using quantum Monte Carlo\nmethods8 . This represents a substantial technical advance, and has stirred great interest in\nfinding other computational approaches that might allow quantum algorithm performance\n\n\fto be determined for still larger qubit systems.\nQuantum computation is not the only research area struggling with the difficulties of\nsimulating quantum systems9 . Condensed-matter physicists and quantum chemists have\nbeen working under the shadow of this problem for decades. A number of computational\napproaches have been developed which, together with increasingly more powerful computers,\nhave allowed much progress to be made, in spite of the ultimately unavoidable difficulties\ninvolved. Among these approaches, density functional theory (DFT) has proven to be one\nof the most successful10,11,12 . DFT is a theory of interacting fermion systems. It provides an\nexact treatment of all many-body effects through the exchange-correlation energy functional.\nIt can also handle the coupling of such fermion systems to both static and time-varying electric and magnetic fields. Ground-state density functional theory (GS-DFT) has been used\nto determine a wide range of ground-state properties of atomic, molecular, and solid state\nsystems13,14 ; while time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been used to\ndetermine excited-state properties, as well as the linear and non-linear response of interacting many-electron systems to electromagnetic fields15,16 . For our purposes, it is especially\nsignificant that DFT has been successfully applied to quantum systems containing N \u223c 103\ninteracting degrees of freedom17,18,19 .\nIn this paper we establish the applicability of DFT methods to quantum computing\nsystems. By establishing this link, we shall see that a powerful tool becomes available for\ndetermining the properties of very large quantum computing systems. Although our analysis\ncan be extended to the case of N qudits (d-level systems) residing on a D-dimensional lattice,\nwe restrict the presentation to N qubits residing on a 2D lattice since this corresponds to\nthe experimentally interesting cases of qubits placed in a 2D ion trap20 , or restricted to a\nplanar superconducting qubit circuit21 .\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. We begin in Section II by showing how an N qubit\nsystem can be transformed into a system of N lattice fermions, and then in Section III, illustrate this transformation by using it to re-write the dynamics of the QAE algorithm applied\nto the NP-Complete problem MAXCUT 22 . For the resulting interacting fermion system,\nSection IV establishes the Hohenberg-Kohn13 and Runge-Gross15 theorems, and sets up the\nauxiliary Kohn-Sham system of non-interacting fermions14 . The results of Section IV provide\nthe justification for applying GS- and TD-DFT to quantum computing systems. The proofs\ngiven in Section IV are adaptations of well-established proofs used for interacting electron\n\n\fsystems, and so their validity should not be in doubt. Section V works out the linear response of the system of interacting fermionized qubits using TD-DFT, and as an application,\nshows how this response can be used to determine the minimum energy gap \u2206(N) for the\nMAXCUT dynamics. Here we begin to see the value of the newly established link between\nDFT and quantum computing. Calculation of \u2206(N) boils down to a calculation of excitation energies, and the reliable calculation of excitation energies for very large interacting\nelectron systems was one of the first triumphs of TD-DFT. A straightforward adaptation of\nstandard TD-DFT arguments then determines \u2206(N). In light of earlier remarks, the link\nestablished in this paper between DFT and quantum computing raises the realistic prospect\nof evaluating the minimum gap \u2206(N) for N \u223c 103 qubits, and thus of studying the performance of the QAE algorithm for much larger qubit systems than is currently possible using\nother approaches. Although we focus on the calculation of the minimum gap in this paper,\nit is clear that the application of DFT to quantum computing systems has a much broader\nrange, and shows genuine promise as a means for determining the properties of very large\nquantum computing systems. Finally, the paper closes in Section VI with a discussion of\nfuture work.\n\nII.\n\nQUBIT\u2013FERMION TRANSFORMATION\n\nConsider N qubits residing on an N-site 2D lattice with basis vectors \u00eak (k = 1, 2), and\nsites specified by the position vector r. Let \u03c3(r) denote the Pauli matrices associated with\nthe qubit at r. We now show how the qubits can be converted into lattice fermions via the\n2D Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation23 . Note that the following analysis can be extended\nto N qudits (viz. N d-level systems) on a D-dimensional lattice using the generalized JW\ntransformation24 that fermionizes a spin s system (d = 2s + 1) in D spatial dimensions.\nFor a 2D system of qubits, the JW transformation is:\n\u03c3 + (r) = 2a\u2020r Qr\n\u03c3 \u2212 (r) = 2Q\u2020r ar\n\u03c3z (r) = 2n\u0302r \u2212 1.\n\n(3)\n\nHere: \u03c3 \u00b1 (r) = \u03c3x (r) \u00b1 i\u03c3y (r); a\u2020r (ar ) creates (annihilates) a lattice fermion at r; n\u0302r = a\u2020r ar\n\n\fis the fermion number operator at r; and\nQr = exp [\u2212i\u03c6r ] ; \u03c6r =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n2\u03c0\u03b8\n\n\u0013X\n\n\u03a6(r, r\u2032 ) n\u0302r\u2032 .\n\n(4)\n\nr\u2032\n\nIn Eq. (4), \u03a6(r, r\u2032 ) is the angle made by (r \u2212 r\u2032 ) with respect to some reference direction, say\n\u00ea1 . Thus: (i) \u03a6(r, r\u2032 ) changes by 2\u03c0 when (r \u2212 r\u2032 ) traces out a closed loop around r\u2032 ; and\n(ii) by convention, \u03a6(r, r) \u2261 0. The requirement that the Pauli operators \u03c3(r) commute at\ndifferent lattice sites forces \u03b8 to satisfy\n1\n= 2m + 1\n2\u03c0\u03b8\n\n(m = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, * * * )\n\nin Eq. (4).\nAs shown in Ref. 23, the lattice fermions are spinless, and minimally-coupled to a gauge\nfield Ak (r) = \u2206k \u03c6r \u2261 \u03c6r+\u00eak \u2212 \u03c6r . The action for the gauge-field A\u03bc (r) is given by the\nChern-Simons term25\n\u03b8\nAcs = \u2212\n4\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\nX\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03bc (r)F\u03bd\u03bb (r).\n\nr\n\nMaxwell's equations for this system take the form\njr\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb F\u03bd\u03bb (r),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere jr\u03bc is the fermion current, F\u03bd\u03bb (r) is the gauge field tensor, \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb is the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor, and \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03bb = 0, 1, 2. From Eq. (5), the fermion current jr,\u03bc\nhas components\njr,0 = nr ,\n1 X\n{\u2206k Gr,y } {\u2202t ny }\njr,k =\n2\u03c0 y\n\n(k = 1, 2),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Gr,y is the Green's function for the lattice Laplacian\nX\n\n\u2206k \u2206k Gr,y = \u22122\u03c0\u03b4r,y .\n\nk=1,2\n\nFermion current conservation, \u2202\u03bc j \u03bc = 0, follows immediately from Maxwell's equations.\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION: NP-COMPLETE PROBLEM MAXCUT\n\nIn the problem MAXCUT, one considers an N-node undirected graph G with nodes\nspecified by r. The nodes (edges) are assigned weights wr (wr,r\u2032 ), and a binary variable sr\n\n\fis associated with each node r. A cut of the graph G is a partition of the nodes into two\nsets S0 and S1 . For all nodes belonging to S0 (S1 ), sr is assigned the value 0 (1). The node\nvariables are used to construct a string variable s = sr1 * * * srN , and all possible assignments\nof the N (binary) node variables leads to 2N possible string assignments for s. It follows\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between cuts of G and string assignments for s.\nThe MAXCUT problem is to find the cut (viz. string assignment) that maximizes the payoff\nfunction P (s) given by\nP (s) =\n\nX\n\nsr w r +\n\nX\n\nsr (1 \u2212 sr\u2032 )wr,r\u2032 .\n\nr,r\u2032\n\nr\n\nMAXCUT is known6 to be NP-Complete, and so it belongs to the set of \"hardest problems\"\nin the complexity class NP.\nThe QAE algorithm was applied to MAXCUT in Ref. 22, where the dynamics is driven\nby the Hamiltonian\nH(t) =\n\n\u0012\n\nt\n1\u2212\nT\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\nH0 +\nHP .\nT\n\n(7)\n\nHere T is the algorithm runtime,\nH0 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c3x (r),\n\n(8)\n\nr\n\nand\nHP =\n\nX\n\nwr (1 \u2212 \u03c3z (r))/2\n\nr\n\n+\n\nX\n\nwr,r\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03c3z (r)\u03c3z (r\u2032 ))/2.\n\n(9)\n\nr,r\u2032\n\nThe Hamiltonian HP is known as the problem Hamiltonian. From Eq. (9), its eigenstates\nare the simultaneous eigenstates of the {\u03c3z (r)}:\n\u03c3z (r)|sr1 * * * srN i = (\u22121)sr |sr1 * * * srN i.\nBy construction 1,22 , each bit string s = s1 * * * sN that maximizes the MAXCUT payoff function labels a ground-state |s1 * * * sN i of HP . The QAE algorithm places the qubit system in\nthe ground-state of the initial Hamiltonian H0 , and for runtime T sufficiently large, H(t)\nevolves the quantum state adiabatically so that at time T , the system is in the ground-state\nof the final Hamiltonian HP with probability approaching 1. Measurement of the {\u03c3z (r)} at\ntime T yields, with probability approaching 1, a string s1 * * * sN that solves the MAXCUT\ninstance.\n\n\fUsing Eqs. (3) in H(t) gives the fermionized QAE Hamiltonian for MAXCUT:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt X \u2020\n[ar Qr + Q\u2020r ar ]\nH(t) = 1 \u2212\nT\n\u0012 \u0013X r\n\u0012 \u0013XX\nt\nt\n+\nwr,r\u2032 n\u0302r n\u0302r\u2032 ],\nvr n\u0302r +\nT\nT\n\u2032\nr\nr r 6=r\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nwr \u2261 vr + Wr ;\nX\nWr =\nwr,r\u2032 ;\nr\u2032 6=r\n\nand a term proportional to the identity has been suppressed.\n\nIV.\n\nDENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY\n\nIn this Section we establish the applicability of the Hohenberg-Kohn and Runge-Gross\ntheorems to the QAE/MAXCUT problem. These theorems justify the use of, respectively,\nground-state and time-dependent density functional theory to the MAXCUT dynamics.\nThroughout, the ground-state is assumed to be non-degenerate, as would be appropriate\nfor a non-vanishing minimum gap \u2206. The formalism can be extended, however, to cover\ndegenerate ground-states26,27 .\n\nA.\n\nGround-State Density Functional Theory\n\nWe have seen that the QAE algorithm has an adiabatic dynamics that is driven by a\nslowly-varying Hamiltonian H(t). In this subsection we focus on the MAXCUT Hamiltonian\nH(t) at a fixed instant of time t = t\u2217 . By fixing the time, we obtain a well-defined static\nHermitian operator H\u2217 \u2261 H(t = t\u2217 ). The aim of this subsection is to show that the\nHohenberg-Kohn theorem applies to H\u2217 . With this theorem in place, GS-DFT can be used\nto study the ground-state properties of H\u2217 = H(t = t\u2217 ) for any specific intermediate time\n0 < t\u2217 < T . We stress that even though the QAE algorithm works with a slowly-varying\nHamiltonian, the discussion in this subsection is restricted to the static Hermitian operator\nH\u2217 = H(t\u2217 ) that is the value of H(t) at the time t = t\u2217 .\n\n\fOur starting point is the energy functional for the instantaneous MAXCUT Hamiltonian\nH\u2217 \u2261 H(t = t\u2217 ):\nE[n] = min h\u03c8|H\u2217 |\u03c8i.\n|\u03c8i\u2192n\n\n(11)\n\nThe domain of E[n] is the set of all N-representable site occupation functions (SOF) nr that\ncan be obtained from an N-fermion wavefunction. The minimization in Eq. (11) is over all\n|\u03c8i for which\nn \u2261 nr = h\u03c8|n\u0302r |\u03c8i,\nand the minimizing state |\u03c8min [n]i is thus a functional of nr . Let |\u03c8 g i denote the groundstate of H\u2217 ; E g the ground-state energy; and ngr the ground-state SOF. Inserting Eq. (10)\ninto (11) gives\nE[n] = (t\u2217 /T )\n\nX\n\nvr nr + Q[n],\n\nr\n\nwhere\nQ[n] \u2261 min h\u03c8|(Tt\u2217 + Ut\u2217 )|\u03c8i,\n|\u03c8i\u2192n\n\nand Tt\u2217 and Ut\u2217 are the first and third terms, respectively, on the RHS of Eq. (10) at t = t\u2217 .\nTo establish the Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem for H\u2217 we must show28 : (i) E[ng ] = E g ;\n(ii) for nr 6= ngr , E[n] > E g ; and (iii) the ground-state expectation value of any observable is a\nunique functional of the ground-state SOF ngr . By the variational principle, h\u03c8|H\u2217 |\u03c8i \u2265 E g ,\nwith equality when |\u03c8i = |\u03c8 g i. Thus, for n = ng , the search in Eq. (11) returns the\nground-state |\u03c8 g i as the state |\u03c8min [ng ]i that minimizes E[ng ]. It follows that\nE[ng ] = h\u03c8 g |H\u2217 |\u03c8 g i = E g .\nThis establishes condition (i). For n 6= ng , the minimizing state |\u03c8min [n]i =\n6 |\u03c8 g [ng ]i, and so\nby the variational principle,\nE[n] = h\u03c8min [n]|H\u2217 |\u03c8min [n] i > E g .\nThis establishes condition (ii). Finally, since the ground-state |\u03c8 g i = |\u03c8min [ng ]i, it is a\nfunctional of ng , and consequently, so are all ground-state expectation values:\nh\u00d4igs = h\u03c8 g |\u00d4|\u03c8 g i\n= h\u03c8min [ng ]| \u00d4 |\u03c8min[ng ] i\n= O[ng ].\n\n\fCondition (iii) is thus established, completing the proof of the HK theorem for H\u2217 = H(t\u2217 ).\nTo obtain a practical calculational scheme, an auxiliary system of non-interacting KohnSham (KS) fermions is introduced14 , and it is assumed that the ground-state SOF ngr can be\nobtained from the ground-state density of the KS fermions moving in an external potential\nvrks . For H\u2217 = H(t\u2217 ), the KS Hamiltonian Hks = Tt\u2032\u2217 + V ks is defined to be:\n\u0013\nX \u0012 t\u2217 \u0013\nX\u0012\nt\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2217\n{qr ar + qr ar } +\nvrks n\u0302r ,\nHks =\n1\u2212\nT\nT\nr\nr\nwhere qr = hQr i is the ground-state expectation value of Qr . The effects of Qr are thus\nincorporated into the KS dynamics through the mean-field qr . The KS energy functional\n\u01ebks [n] is:\n\u01ebks [n] = min h\u03c8|Hks|\u03c8i =\n|\u03c8i\u2192n\n\nTt\u2032\u2217 [n]\n\n+\n\nX \u0012 t\u2217 \u0013\nr\n\nT\n\nvrks nr .\n\nTo determine the KS external potential vrks , we re-write Eq. (11) as\nX \u0012 t\u2217 \u0013\n\u2032\nvr nr + \u03bexc [n],\nE[n] = Tt\u2217 [n] +\nT\nr\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n\u03bexc [n] \u2261 Q[n] \u2212 Tt\u2032\u2217 [n]\nis the exchange-correlation energy functional. As noted in Section I, it is through the\nexchange-correlation energy functional \u03bexc [n] that DFT accounts for all many-body effects.\nSince ngr minimizes both \u01ebks [n] and E[n], Eqs. (12) and (13) are stationary about n = ng .\nTaking their functional derivatives with respect to n, evaluating the result at n = ng , and\neliminating \u03b4Tt\u2032\u2217 /\u03b4n|n=ng gives\nvrks\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nT\n= vr +\nvxc [ng ](r),\nt\u2217\n\n(14)\n\nfor t\u2217 6= 0. Here vxc [ng ](r) is the exchange-correlation potential which is the functional\nderivative of the exchange-correlation energy functional \u03bexc [ng ]:\nvxc [ng ](r) =\n\n\u03b4\u03bexc [ng ]\n.\n\u03b4ngr\n\nThis sets in place the formulas for a self-consistent calculation of the ground-state properties\nof H\u2217 = H(t\u2217 ) using GS-DFT. Entanglement29 and its links to quantum phase transitions30\nhave been studied using GS-DFT.\n\n\fB.\n\nTime Dependent Density Functional Theory\n\nHere we establish the Runge-Gross theorem15 for the instantaneous MAXCUT dynamics.\nThus we focus on the instantaneous Hamiltonian H\u2217 = H(t\u2217 ) for a fixed t\u2217 (0 < t\u2217 < T ).\nNow, however, we suppose that the external potential vr in H(t\u2217 ) begins to vary at a\nmoment we call t = 0. For t \u2264 0, vr (t) = vr , and the fermions are in the ground-state\n|\u03c80 i of H(t\u2217 ). The Runge-Gross theorem states that the SOFs nr (t) and n\u2032r (t) evolving\nfrom a common initial state |\u03c8(0)i = |\u03c80 i under the influence of the respective potentials\nVr (t) and Vr\u2032 (t) (both Taylor-series expandable about t = 0) will be different provided that\n[Vr (t) \u2212 Vr\u2032 (t)] 6= C(t). For us:\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\nt\u2217\n1\u2212\nVr (t) =\nT\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\nt\u2217\n\u2032\n1\u2212\nVr (t) =\nT\n\n\u0013\nt\u2217\nvr (t)\nT\n\u0013\nt\u2217\nvr\u2032 (t)\nT\n\nand\nVr (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nak (r)tk /k!;\n\nVr\u2032 (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na\u2032k (r)tk /k!.\n\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nLet Ck (r) \u2261\n\nak (r)\u2212a\u2032k (r).\n\nThe condition that [Vr (t)\u2212Vr\u2032 (t)] 6= C(t) means a smallest integer\n\nK exists such that Ck (r) is a non-trivial function of r for all k \u2265 K, while for k < K, it is\na constant Ck which can be set to zero without loss of generality.\nRecall (Eq. (6)) that the conserved fermion current has components\n\u0135r,0 (t) = nr (t),\n\u0012 \u0013X\n1\n\u0135r,k (t) =\n(\u2206k Gr,y )\u2202t ny (t),\n2\u03c0\ny\nwith k = 1, 2. Defining jr,k (t) = h\u03c80 |\u0135r,k (t)|\u03c80 i, it follows that\n\u2032\n\u2202t {jr,k (t) \u2212 jr,k\n(t)} = h\u03c80 |[\u0135 r,k (t), H(t) \u2212 H \u2032 (t)]|\u03c80 i.\n\n(15)\n\n\u2032\nHere jr,k (t) (jr,k\n(t)) and H(t) (H \u2032 (t)) are the expected fermion current and the Hamiltonian,\n\nrespectively, when the external potential is vr (t) (vr\u2032 (t)). The Hamiltonians H(t) and H \u2032(t)\ndiffer only in the external potential. Defining\n\u2032\n\u03b4jr,k (t) = jr,k (t) \u2212 jr,k\n(t),\n\n\fand\n\u03b4Vy (t) = Vy (t) \u2212 Vy\u2032 (t),\nevaluation of the commutator in Eq. (15) eventually gives\n\u0012 \u0013X\n1\n(\u2206k Gr,y ) \u03b4Vy (t) My (t),\n\u2202t {\u03b4jr,k (t)} = \u2212\n2\u03c0\ny\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\nMy (t) = h\u03c80 |(a\u2020y Qy + Q\u2020y ay )|\u03c80 i.\nWith K defined as above, taking K time-derivatives of Eq. (16) and evaluating the result\nat t = 0 gives\n\n\u2202 K+1\n(\u03b4jr,k (t))\n\u2202tK+1\n\nwhere we have used that\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013X\n\n(\u2206k Gr,y )My (0)CK (r),\n\n(17)\n\ny\n\n\u2202k\n(\u03b4Vy (t)) |t=0 = Ck (y) = 0\n\u2202tk\n\nfor k < K. It is important to note that My (0) 6= 0. This follows since\n[H(t\u2217 ), nr (t\u2217 )] 6= 0\nfor t\u2217 6= T , and so the eigenstates of H(t\u2217 ) (specifically, its ground-state |\u03c80 i) cannot be\nfermion number eigenstates. This ensures that the ground-state expectation value\nMy (0) = h\u03c80 |(a\u2020y Qy + Q\u2020y ay )|\u03c80 i =\n6 0\nfor t\u2217 6= T . It follows from the continuity equation for the fermion current that\nX\n\u2202\n(nr (t) \u2212 n\u2032r (t)) = \u2212\n\u2206k {\u03b4jr,k (t)} .\n\u2202t\nk=1,2\nTaking K time-derivatives of this equation, evaluating the result at t = 0, and using Eq. (17)\ngives\n\n\u2202 K+2\n(nr (t) \u2212 n\u2032r (t)) |t=0 = \u2212CK (r)Mr (0) 6= 0,\n\u2202tK+2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have used the equation of motion for Gr,y . Equation (18) indicates that nr (t)\ncannot equal n\u2032r (t) since it insures that they will be different at t = 0+ , and so cannot be\nthe same function. This proves the Runge-Gross theorem for the instantaneous MAXCUT\ndynamics.\n\n\fWe have just seen that when potentials Vr (t) and Vr\u2032 (t) differ by a time-dependent function\nC(t), they give rise to the same SOF nr (t). However, the wavefunctions produced by these\npotentials from the same initial state will differ by a time-dependent phase factor. For our\npurposes, it is important to note that this extra phase factor cancels out when calculating\nthe expectation value of an operator. In particular, it will cancel out when calculating the\ninstantaneous energy eigenvalues En (t) = hEn (t)|H(t)|En (t)i. As a result, this phase factor\nwill not affect our calculation of the minimum energy gap in Section V. Having said that,\nit is worth noting that this subtlety is not expected to cause difficulties in practice since the\nprobe potential Vr (t) is assumed to be under the direct control of the experimenter, and so\nthe precise form of Vr (t) is known. When an experimentalist says a sinusoidal probe potential\nhas been applied, this means Vr (t) = Vr sin \u03c9t; it does not mean Vr (t) = Vr sin \u03c9t + C(t).\nThus in a well-designed experiment C(t) = 0.\nThe Kohn-Sham (KS) system of non-interacting fermions can also be introduced in TDDFT15 . We must still assume that the interacting SOF nr (t) can be obtained from the SOF\nof the non-interacting KS fermions moving in the external potential vrks (t). The potentials\nvrks (t) and vr (t) are related via (t\u2217 6= 0)\nvrks (t)\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nT\nvxc [n(t)](r)\n= vr (t) +\nt\u2217\n\n(19)\n\nthough Eq. (19) is to be thought of as defining the time-dependent exchange-correlation\npotential vxc [n(t)](r).\n\nV.\n\nMINIMUM GAP\n\nA problem of longstanding treachery in GS-DFT is the calculation of the excitation\nenergies of a fermion system. TD-DFT was able to find these energies by determining the\nsystem's frequency-dependent linear response, and relating the excitation energies to poles\nappearing in that response. The arguments used31 are quite general, and can be easily\nadapted to determine the energy gap for the instantaneous MAXCUT dynamics.\nPreviously, we considered an external potential that becomes time-varying for t \u2265 0.\nOur interest is in the interacting fermion linear response, and so we assume that the total\npotential has the form\nvrtot (t) = vr + vr1 (t),\n\n\fwith vr1 (t) a suitably small time-varying perturbation. The probe potential vr1 (t) generates\na first-order response n1r (t) in the SOF:\ng\n1\nntot\nr (t) = nr + nr (t).\n\nThe susceptibility \u03c7r,r\u2032 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) connects the first-order probe potential to the SOF response.\nThe total potential vrtot (t) is related to the KS potential vrks (t) through Eq. (19), and by\nassumption, the SOF for both the interacting and KS fermions is the same. This allows the\ntime-Fourier transform of the SOF response n1r (\u03c9) to be determined from the time-Fourier\ng\n\u2032\ntransforms of the KS susceptibility \u03c7ks\nr,r\u2032 (\u03c9), the exchange-correlation kernel fxc [n ](r, r ; \u03c9),\n\nand the probe potential vr1 (\u03c9):\nX\n\n{\u03b4r,y\u2032 \u2212\n\ny\u2032\n\nX\n\ng\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\n\u03c7ks\nr,r\u2032 (\u03c9)fxc [n ](r , y ; \u03c9)}ny\u2032 (\u03c9)\n\nr\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\n\n1\n\u03c7ks\nr,r\u2032 (\u03c9)vr\u2032 (\u03c9).\n\n(20)\n\nr\u2032\n\nThe KS susceptibility16 depends on the KS static unperturbed orbitals \u03c6jr ; and the corresponding energy eigenvalues \u03b5j and orbital occupation numbers fj :\n\u03c7ks\nr,r\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\n(fk \u2212 fj )\n\nj,k\n\n\u03c6j (r)\u03c6k (r)\u03c6j (r\u2032 )\u03c6k (r\u2032 )\n.\n\u03c9 \u2212 (\u03b5j \u2212 \u03b5k ) + i\u03b7\n\n(21)\n\nThe exchange-correlation kernel fxc [ng ] incorporates all many-body effects into the linear\nresponse dynamics, and is related to the exchange-correlation potential vxc [ng ] through a\nfunctional derivative:\nfxc [ng ] =\n\n\u03b4vxc [ng ]\n.\n\u03b4ng\n\nIn general, the interacting fermion excitation energies\n\u03a9jk = Ej \u2212 Ek\ndiffer from the KS excitation energies\n\u03c9jk = \u03b5j \u2212 \u03b5k .\nThe RHS of Eq. (20) remains finite as \u03c9 \u2192 \u03a9jk , while the first-order SOF response n1y\u2032 (\u03c9)\nhas a pole at each \u03a9jk . Thus the operator on the LHS acting on n1y\u2032 (\u03c9) cannot be invertible.\nOtherwise, its inverse could be applied to both sides of Eq. (20) with the result that the RHS\n\n\fwould remain finite as \u03c9 \u2192 \u03a9jk , while the LHS would diverge. To avoid this inconsistency,\nthe operator must have a zero eigenvalue as \u03c9 \u2192 \u03a9jk . Following Ref. 31, one is led to the\nfollowing eigenvalue problem:\nX Mkj;k\u2032j \u2032 (\u03c9)\n\u03bek\u2032 j \u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03bb(\u03c9)\u03bekj (\u03c9),\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9j \u2032k\u2032 + i\u03b7\nk \u2032 ,j \u2032\n\n(22)\n\nwhere, writing\n\u03b1k\u2032 j \u2032 = fk\u2032 \u2212 fj \u2032 ,\nand\n\u03a6kj\nr = \u03c6k (r)\u03c6j (r),\nwe have\nMk\u2032 j \u2032 ;kj (\u03c9) = \u03b1k\u2032 j \u2032\n\nX\n\nkj\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n\u03a6r\u2032 {fxc [ng ](r\u2032 , y\u2032 ; \u03c9)} \u03a6yk \u2032j (\u03c9).\n\nr\u2032 ,y\u2032\n\nIt can be shown that \u03bb(\u03a9jk ) = 1.\nAt this point in the argument, it proves necessary to introduce some form of approximation to proceed further. In the single-pole approximation31 the KS poles are assumed to\nbe well-separated so that we can focus on a particular KS excitation energy \u03c9jk = \u03c9\u2217 . The\neigenvectors \u03bek\u2032 j \u2032 (\u03c9) and the matrix operator Mkj;k\u2032j \u2032 (\u03c9) are finite at \u03c9\u2217 , while the eigenvalue\n\u03bb(\u03c9) must have a pole there to match the pole on the LHS of Eq. (22):\n\u03bb(\u03c9) =\n\nA(\u03c9\u2217 )\n+ O(1).\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217 )\n\nLet \u03c9\u2217 be d-fold degenerate: \u03c9k1 j1 , * * * , \u03c9kd jd = \u03c9\u2217 . Matching singularities in Eq. (22) gives\nd\nX\n\nMki ji ;kl\u2032 jl\u2032 (\u03c9\u2217 ) \u03beknl\u2032 jl\u2032 = An (\u03c9\u2217 ) \u03bekniji (\u03c9\u2217 ),\n\n(23)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere i, n = 1, . . . , d. For our purposes, the eigenvalues An (\u03c9\u2217 ) are of primary interest and\nare found from Eq. (23). From each An (\u03c9\u2217 ), we find\nAn (\u03c9\u2217 )\n.\n\u03bb (\u03c9) =\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217 )\nn\n\nSince \u03bbn (\u03a9jk ) = 1, it follows that the sum of \u03bbn (\u03a9jk ) and its complex conjugate is 2. Plugging\ninto this sum the singular expressions for \u03bbn (\u03a9jk ) and that of its complex conjugate, and\nsolving for \u03a9njk gives\n\u03a9njk = \u03c9\u2217 + Re[An (\u03c9\u2217 )].\n\n\fInteractions will thus generally split the \u03c9\u2217 -degeneracy. Now let\n\u03b4E = min Re[An (\u03c9\u2217 )]\nn\n\nand\n\u03a9jk = min \u03a9njk .\nn\n\nOur expression for \u03a9njk then gives\n\u03a9jk = \u03c9\u2217 + \u03b4E.\nIn the context of the QAE algorithm, our interest is the energy gap\n\u2206(t\u2217 ) = E1 (t\u2217 ) \u2212 E0 (t\u2217 )\nseparating the instantaneous ground and first-excited states. In this case, our expression for\n\u03a9jk gives\n\u2206(t\u2217 ) = [\u03b51 (t\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b50 (t\u2217 )] + \u03b4E(t\u2217 ).\n\n(24)\n\nTo obtain the minimum gap \u2206 for QAE numerically, one picks a sufficiently large number\nof t\u2217 \u2208 (0, T ); solves for \u2206(t\u2217 ) using the KS system associated with H(t\u2217 ) to evaluate the\nRHS of Eq. (24); then uses the minimum of the resulting set of \u2206(t\u2217 ) to upper bound \u2206.\nBecause the KS dynamics is non-interacting, it has been possible to treat KS systems with\nN \u223c 103 KS fermions17,18,19 . This would allow the evaluation of the minimum gap \u2206(N) for\nthe QAE algorithm for N \u223c 103 .\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs with all KS calculations, the minimum gap calculation requires an approximation\nfor the exchange-correlation energy functional \u03bexc [n]. Note that, because the qubits in a\nquantum register must be located at fixed positions for the register to function properly, the\nassociated JW fermions are distinguishable since they are each pinned to a specific lattice\nsite. Consequently, anti-symmetrization of the fermion wavefunction is not required, with\nthe result that the exchange energy vanishes in the MAXCUT dynamics. The exchangecorrelation energy functional \u03bexc [n] is then determined solely by the correlation energy which\ncan be calculated using the methods of Ref. 32. Parametrization of these results yields\n\n\fanalytical expressions for the correlation energy per particle which, upon differentiation, give\nvxc [n] and fxc [n]. Replacing n \u2192 nr in \u03bexc [n] gives the local density approximation (LDA) for\nGS-DFT; while n \u2192 nr (t) gives the adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) for TDDFT. These simple approximations have proven to be remarkably successful, and provide a\ngood starting point for the minimum gap calculation. Self-interaction corrections to \u03bexc [n]\nare not necessary since the two-fermion interaction [see Eq. (10)] has no self-interaction\nterms. Finally, because the fermions are pinned, it will be necessary to test the gap for\nsensitivity to derivative discontinuities33 in \u03bec [n].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank A.
