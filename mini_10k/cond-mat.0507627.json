The main result is that for any\n(even small in height) roughness the square-gradient terms in the expression for the wave scattering\nlength (electron mean free path) are dominant, provided the correlation length of the surface disorder\nis small enough. This important effect is missed in existing studies of the surface scattering.\n\n1. The problem of wave transport (both classical and\nquantum) through the guiding surface-disordered systems has a quite long history and remains a hot topic\ntill now (see, e.g., Refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,\n15,16,17 and references therein). One of the main tools to\ntreat this problem is the reduction of the wave/electron\nsurface scattering to the bulk one in such a way that the\nlatter can be described by an effective Hamiltonian with\na complicated potential, however, with flat boundaries.\nApplying this approach, one can reasonably discriminate\nbetween the so-called amplitude and gradient scattering,\nand analyze their interplay explicitly.\nTo the best of our knowledge, originally the idea of\nthis approach was discussed by Migdal5 . After, it was\nfrequently used in the theories of classical and quantum\nwave/electron scattering, see, e.g., Refs. 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,\n13. But in the majority of them6,7,8,9,10 the study was\nrestricted to the lowest order in the roughness height \u03c3.\nOther methods11,12,13,14,15,16,17 were mainly based on the\nprincipal assumption that the surface roughness is sufficiently smooth.\nIn this contribution we present the theory of wave scattering from rough surfaces, which takes into account both\nthe amplitude and gradient scattering mechanisms. The\nimportant point is that we do not assume any special\nrestrictions on the model parameters except for general\nconditions of weak scattering. The latter provides us with\nan appropriate perturbative approach in scattering potential, however, is not restricted by the smoothness of\nsurfaces.\nThe main attention is paid to the competition between\nthe amplitude and gradient scattering. One of our main\nresults is that at fixed r.m.s. roughness height \u03c3, the less\ncorrelation length Rc of a random surface profile, the\nlarger contribution of the gradient mechanism. Thus, by\npassing from the smooth to white-noise profiles, the gradient scattering becomes to prevail. We have analyzed\nthis crossover and obtained the estimates describing the\ntransition to the dominating gradient scattering. In par-\n\nticular, we show that this transition is located within the\nregion of small roughness slopes where \u03c3/Rc \u226a 1.\n2. In what follows we consider an open plane waveguide (or conducting quasi-one-dimensional quantum wire)\nof the average width d, stretched along the x-axis. For\nsimplicity, one (lower) surface of the waveguide is assumed to be flat, z = 0, while the other (upper) surface\nhas a rough profile z = w(x) = d + \u03c3\u03be(x) with h\u03be(x)i = 0\nand \u03be 2 (x) = 1. The average h...i is performed over\ndifferent realizations of a statistically homogeneous and\nisotropic Gaussian random function \u03be(x). We also assume that its pair correlator h\u03be(x)\u03be(x\u2032 )i = W(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) decreases on a scale Rc , with the normalization W(0) = 1.\nThe roughness-height power (RHP) spectrum W (kx ) is\ndefined by\nZ \u221e\nW (kx ) =\ndx exp(\u2212ikx x) W(x).\n(1)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nSince W(x) is an even function of x, its Fourier transform\n(1) is even, real and nonnegative function of kx . The\nRHP spectrum has maximum at kx = 0 with W (0) \u223c Rc ,\nand decreases on the scale Rc\u22121 .\nIn order to analyze the surface scattering for our\nmodel, we employ the method of the retarded Green's\nfunction G(x, x\u2032 ; z, z \u2032). Specifically, we start with the\nDirichlet boundary-value problem\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u22022\n2\n+ 2 + k G(x, x\u2032 ; z, z \u2032)\n\u2202x2\n\u2202z\n= \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ),\n\n(2)\n\nG(x, x\u2032 ; z = 0, z \u2032 ) = G(x, x\u2032 ; z = w(x), z \u2032 ) = 0.\n\n(3)\n\nHere the wave number k is equal to \u03c9/c for an electromagnetic wave of the frequency \u03c9 and TE polarization,\npropagating through a waveguide with perfectly conducting walls. As for an electron quantum wire, k is the Fermi\nwave number within the isotropic Fermi-liquid model. In\n\n\f2\norder to express the surface scattering as a bulk one, we\nperform the transformation to new coordinates,\nxnew = xold ,\n\nznew = zold d/[d + \u03c3\u03be(x)],\n\nwe have obtained the average Green's function which in\nthe normal-mode representation has the form\n\n(4)\n\u2032\n\nin which both waveguide surfaces are flat. Correspondingly, we introduce p\nthe canonically conjugate Green's\nfunction, Gnew = d\u22121 w(x)w(x\u2032 )Gold and omit the subscript \"new\" in what follows. As a result, we arrive at\nthe equivalent boundary-value problem governed by the\nequation with a \"bulk\" perturbation potential,\n(\n\u0015 2\n\u0014\n\u2202\n\u22022\nd2\n\u22022\n2\n+ 2 +k \u2212 1\u2212 2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202z\nw (x) \u2202z 2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u03c3\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u2032\n\u2202\n1\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u03be (x)\n+\n\u03be (x)\n+z\nw(x)\n\u2202x \u2202x\n2\n\u2202z\n)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u03c3 2 \u03be \u2032 (x) 3\nG(x, x\u2032 ; z, z \u2032)\n+ 3z\n+ z2 2\n+ 2\nw (x) 4\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n= \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ),\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nhG(x, x ; z, z )i =\n\n\u2032\n\nG(x, x ; z = 0, z ) = G(x, x ; z = d, z ) = 0.\n\n2\n\nhV\u0302(x)V\u0302(x\u2032 )i = 2h\u03be \u2032 (x)\u03be \u2032 (x\u2032 )i2 = 2W \u2032\u2032 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(7)\n\ndetermines the square-gradient power (SGP) spectrum\nZ \u221e\n2\ndx exp (\u2212ikx x) W \u2032\u2032 (x).\n(8)\nT (kx ) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\nOne should stress that although by integration by parts\nthe power spectrum of the roughness gradients \u03c3\u03be \u2032 (x) can\nbe reduced to the RHP spectrum W (kx ), this is not possible for the SGP spectrum T (kx ). This very fact reflects\na highly non-trivial role of the square-gradient scattering,\ngiving rise to the competition with the well known amplitude scattering, in spite of the seeming smallness of\n2\nthe term \u03c3 2 \u03be \u2032 (x).\nTo proceed, we pass from Eq. (5) to the Dyson-type\nequation, performing the ensemble averaging with the\nuse of the technique developed in Ref. 3. The method allows one to develop the consistent perturbative approach\nwith respect to the scattering potential, which takes adequately into account the multiple scattering from the corrugated boundary.

Our interest is in the attenuation length or total\nmean free path Ln of the n-th mode. Its inverse value\nis given by the imaginary part of the proper self-energy\nand, in accordance with the form of the scattering potential, consists of two terms describing different scattering\nmechanisms,\n1\n1\n1\n= (1) + (2) .\nLn\nLn\nLn\n\n(6)\n\nHere the prime stands for the derivative over x.\nWe emphasize that Eq.

Moreover, the potential contains the\n2\nterm with the square gradient \u03c3 2 \u03be \u2032 (x).

(10)\n\u2013 (14) are derived. We stress that the Dyson-type equation for the average Green's function was obtained within\nthe second-order approximation in the perturbation potential. This means that the self-energy in this equation\ncontains the binary correlator of the surface-scattering\npotential and the unperturbed Green's function. In\nterms of the diagrammatic technique this is similar to\nthe \"simple vortex\" or, the same, Bourret approximation18 . Following the ideas discussed in Ref. 2, one can\nshow that this approximation is justified when the broadening 1/2Ln of the quantum wave number kn is much\nless than both the correlation scale Rc\u22121 and the spacing\n|kn \u2212 kn\u00b11 | \u2248 |\u2202kn /\u2202n| between neighboring quantum\nwave numbers. The same conditions also arise due to another approximation which is the use of the unperturbed\nvalue kn in the expression for the self-energy, instead\nof the perturbed one. Now we take into account that\n|\u2202kn /\u2202n| \u223c \u039b\u22121\nn , where \u039bn is the distance between two\nsuccessive reflections of a wave from the rough boundary inside the n-th channel. As a result, we come to the\nfollowing conditions of a weak surface scattering\n\u039bn = 2kn d/(\u03c0n/d) \u226a 2Ln ,\n\nRc \u226a 2Ln .\n\n(15)\n\nThese inequalities imply that the electron/wave weakly\nattenuates on both the correlation length Rc and the cycle length \u039bn .\nAs one can see, the expressions (11) and (12) \u2013 (14)\nrepresent, respectively, basic contributions from principally different surface-scattering mechanisms related to\nthe amplitude, gradient and square-gradient terms. It\nshould be emphasized that the corrections proportional\nto \u03c3 4 , originated from higher order approximations in the\namplitude and gradient terms of the perturbation potential, are smaller than the main contribution (11) under\nthe conditions (15). Contrary, the square-gradient terms\ngive rise to the \u03c3 4 -terms in Eqs.(13)-(14) which should\nnot be neglected due to a specific dependence on the correlation length Rc . Note that Eq. (15) implicitly includes\nthe requirement for the surface corrugations be small in\nheight (\u03c3 \u226a d), but does not restrict the value \u03c3/Rc of\nthe roughness slope.\n(2)\n(1)\n4. Since Ln and Ln depend on as many as four\ndimensionless parameters (k\u03c3)2 , kRc , kd/\u03c0, and n, the\ncomplete analysis appears to be quite complicated. For\nthis reason, below we restrict ourselves by the analysis of\n(1)\n(2)\nthe interplay between Ln and Ln as a function of the\ndimensionless correlation length kRc for Nd \u2248 kd/\u03c0 \u226b 1.\nAs follows from Eq. (11), the inverse value of the\namplitude-scattering length typically increases with an\nincrease of kRc . Specifically, in the case of the small(1)\nscale roughness (kRc \u226a 1 <\n\u223c k\u039bn ) we have 1/Ln \u221d kRc .\nThen, within the intermediate region where 1 \u226a kRc \u226a\n(1)\nk\u039bn , the increase of 1/Ln slows down, or can even be\n\nreplaced by the decrease for some values of the model\nparameters. Finally, for large-scale roughness and strong\n(1)\ncorrelations (1 <\n\u223c k\u039bn \u226a kRc ) the value of 1/Ln again\nstarts to increase linearly with kRc .\n(1)\nIn contrast with 1/Ln , the inverse square-gradient\n(2)\nscattering length 1/Ln reveals a monotonous decrease as\nthe parameter kRc increases. At small (kRc \u226a 1 <\n\u223c k\u039bn )\nand extremely large (1 <\n\u223c k\u039bn \u226a kRc ) values of kRc ,\n(2)\nthis decrease obeys the law 1/Ln \u221d (kRc )\u22123 , due to\n\u22123\nT (0) \u223c Rc .\n\u00bfFrom this analysis it becomes clear that the curves\n(2)\n(1)\ndisplaying 1/Ln and 1/Ln must intersect, and one can\nobserve the crossover from the square-gradient to amplitude surface scattering. To the left from the crossing\npoint (kRc )\u2299 the square-gradient scattering length pre(2)\n(1)\nvails, Ln \u226a Ln . To its right the main contribution is\n(1)\n(2)\ndue to the well known amplitude scattering, Ln \u226a Ln .\nIf the crossing point falls onto the interval of the smallscale roughness (kRc \u226a 1), its dependence on the model\nparameters is described by\np\n(kRc )2\u2299 \u223c (k\u03c3)n/ kn d.\n(16)\n\nThis estimate shows that the crossing point is smaller for\nsmaller values of the dimensionless roughness height k\u03c3,\nas well as for smaller mode indices n, or for larger values\nof the parameter kd/\u03c0.\nIn Fig. 1 we display the dependence of \u039bn /2Ln as a\nfunction of kRc assuming the Gaussian binary correlator\nW(x) = exp(\u2212x2 /2Rc2 ) for random surface profile \u03be(x).\nThe curves are plotted starting from such values of kRc\n(2)\nfor which \u039bn /2Ln = 1, according to the first condition\nof Eq. (15). Taking into account the second condition restricting the maximal value of kRc , we plot every curve\n(1)\nwithin the range where Rc < 2Ln . As one can see,\nall curves have the crossover from the square-gradient to\namplitude surface scattering. The first (lowest) one with\n(k\u03c3)2 = 10\u22124 has the crossing point (kRc )\u2299 \u2248 0.2 located within the interval of small-scale roughness, and\nthe crossover reveals a small dip centered at (kRc )\u2299 .\nThe curve obeys the asymptotic behavior (kRc )\u22123 to\nthe left from (kRc )\u2299 due to the main contribution from\n(1)\n(2)\n\u039bn /2Ln . Then the quantity \u039bn /2Ln becomes dominating in the sum (10), therefore, the curve starts to\nrise. Firstly, the linear dependence on kRc on the right\ndeep-side (where kRc < 1) is replaced with a smoother\none (for kRc > 1). Finally, for Rc > \u039bn (strong correlations) the linear dependence restores.\nThe crossing points of the second, third and fourth\ncurves have the values of the order one. Here the total\nattenuation length Ln within the whole small-scale region\n(2)\nis formed by the square-gradient scattering length Ln .\nIn full agreement with Eq. (16) the presented curves display that the smaller parameter (k\u03c3)2 the smaller value\nof the crossing point (kRc )\u2299 .\nNote that for all curves in Fig.1 the roughness height\nis small, \u03c3/d \u226a 1. Furthermore, for the amplitude-\n\n\f4\nAs a result, to the left from the crossing point where the\n(2)\nsquare-gradient term \u039bn /2Ln prevails, the slope reaches\nthe values of the order one, or even larger for the first tree\ncurves.\n\nFIG. 1: \u039bn /2Ln versus kRc at kd/\u03c0 = 62.5, n = 31 and\ndifferent (k\u03c3)2 .\n\ndominated scattering (to the right from the point (kRc )\u2299\n(1)\nwhere \u039bn /2Ln mainly contributes), the average corrugation slope is also small for all data, \u03c3/Rc \u226a 1. The\nroughness slope remains to be small at the crossing points\ntoo, but increases to their left with the decrease of kRc .\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nElectronic address: izrailev@venus.ifuap.buap.mx\nElectronic address: makarov@siu.buap.mx\nElectronic address: mrendon@venus.ifuap.buap.mx\nF.

Rev. B\n\nIn conclusion, we have discovered the principal importance of the square-gradient surface-scattering mechanism which was never taken into account in the literature. We have shown that at any fixed value of the\nroughness height \u03c3 one can indicate the region of small\nvalues of the correlation length Rc where the new square(2)\ngradient scattering length Ln predominates over the\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\nknown amplitude scattering length Ln (Ln \u226a Ln ).\n(1)\nThe predominance occurs in spite of the fact that 1/Ln\n(2)\nis proportional to \u03c3 2 while 1/Ln is proportional to\n\u03c3 4 . This happens since the two lengths are determined\nby the substantially different roughness-height W (kx )\nand roughness-square-gradient T (kx ) power spectra, that\nhave vastly different dependencies on Rc . It is remarkable that the square-gradient mechanism prevails in the\ncommonly used region kRc \u226a 1 of a small-scale boundary perturbation, where the surface roughness is typically\ndescribed via the white-noise potential.\nThis research was partially supported by the CONACYT (M\u00e9xico) grant No 43730, and by the VIEP-BUAP\n(M\u00e9xico) under the grant II 104-05/ING/G.\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n58, 13242 (1998); Phys.
