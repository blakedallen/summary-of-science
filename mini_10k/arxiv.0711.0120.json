The momentum of the particle-hole excitations\nare denoted by q and their energy by \u03c9. The Fermi velocity is given by\nvF . (a) Due to the large volume of the available phase space in two and\nthree dimensions, a particle-hole pair, for q < 2kF , can have a continuum of energies extending from zero. Interactions cannot form coherently\npropagating particle-hole pairs. (b) Contrary to higher dimensions, in one\ndimension due to the reduced phase space the only allowed low-energy\nexcitations are for the two Fermi points, q = 0 and q = 2kF . Particle-hole\nexcitations now have both a well defined energy and momentum for \u03c9 \u2192 0\nand q \u2192 0. A coherently propagating particle-hole pair can now form with\na result that collective bosonic excitations are stable [25]. . . . . . . . . .\n\n9\n\n3.3 The original model of fermions with band curvature (a) is replaced by a\nmodel of fermions with a linear spectrum (b). This causes to introduce\ntwo species of fermions (right (R) and left (L) going fermions).

All the fields with\nwavevector q lying in the momentum shell \u039b/b < q < \u039b, with the scale\nfactor b, are then integrated out leaving a reduced volume of radius \u03bb/b.\n\u2032\nNext, the wavevectors are rescaled by q = bq. As a result we recover the\noriginal volume in the momentum space [104\u2013108]. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n12\n\n4.1 Aluminum arsenide quantum wire fabricated using the cleaved edge overgrowth technique.

When the first two bands are filled, interactions between the\nfour Fermi points lead to gaps. The possibility of density reorganization\nis shown, in which it becomes energeticaly favorable for the first two subbands to match their Fermi momenta. This costs the kinetic energy of\nmoving the densities away from the noninteracting values, but gains the\nCDW gap energy [110].

Note the energy minimum for\naluminum arsenide is not at the \u0393-point. The distance between the two\nopen circles is half an umklapp vector. (b)In our calculation the quantum\nwire bandstructure is modelled with the two degenerate bands labeled A\nand B referring to the degenerate X and Y valleys in an aluminum arsenide\nbandstructure. Even at the lowest densities, there are two degenerate\nsubbands. In addition, the band minima are separated by half an umklapp\nvector, kU /2, giving rise to new \"umklapp\" interactions which are present\nat all fillings. The Fermi points, represented by black dots on the figure,\nare at kFA\u00b1 = \u2212 k4U \u00b1 kFo and kFB\u00b1 = k4U \u00b1 kFo where kU is the umklapp\nvector, and kFo is the magnitude of the Fermi wavevector measured from\nthe bottom of each band.

The dashed lines denote\nthe zero temperature dispersion tracking the charge part with velocity v\u03c1\nand the spin part with velocity v\u03c3 . At T 6= 0, the peaks become thermally\nbroadened as indicated by the shaded regions. In this case the effective\ndispersion now tracks the solid red line, so that the low energy part tracks\nthe sum of the two broad spin and charge peaks, resulting in a low energy\nvelocity vl which is between the spin and charge velocities. Note the high\nenergy effective dispersion is parallel to the charge part but displaced, an\neffect due to finite temperature and interactions.

Theoretical study of interacting electrons in one dimension ground states and experimental signatures. Major\nProfessor: Dr. Erica W. Carlson.\nThis dissertation focuses on a theoretical study of interacting electrons in one\ndimension. The research elucidates the ground state (zero temperature) electronic\nphase diagram of an aluminum arsenide quantum wire which is an example of an\ninteracting one dimensional electron liquid. Using one dimensional field theoretic\nmethods involving abelian bosonization and the renormalization group we show the\nexistence of a spin gapped quantum wire with electronic ground states such as charge\ndensity wave and singlet superconductivity. The superconducting state arises due\nto the unique umklapp interaction present in the aluminum arsenide quantum wire\nbandstructure discussed in this dissertation. It is characterized by Cooper pairs carrying a finite pairing momentum. This is a realization of the Fulde-Ferrell-LarkinOvchinnikov state which is known to lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity. The\ndissertation also presents a theoretical analysis of the finite temperature single hole\nspectral function of the one dimensional electron liquid with gapless spin and charge\nmodes (Luttinger liquid). The hole spectral function is measured in angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy experiments. The results predict a kink in the effective\nelectronic dispersion of the Luttinger liquid. A systematic study of the temperature\nand interaction dependence of the kink provides an alternative way to detect spincharge separation in one dimensional systems where the peak due to the spin part of\nthe spectral function is suppressed.\n\n\f1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nElectronic systems in which the kinetic energy is treated as the starting point with\nthe Coulomb interaction as a perturbation can be described by a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles. The quantum numbers of the quasiparticle are similar to\nthe non-interacting particle they are derived from. The quasiparticle parameters,\nsuch as mass and charge, are redefined to their effective values due to interactions.\nThe principal effects of the mutual electron-electron interaction are assumed to be\nadequately captured in these effective parameters. This is the Landau Fermi liquid\nparadigm [1\u20133]. Although it has been a cornerstone of solid state physics for over\nfifty years, there is increasing experimental [4\u20136] and theoretical evidence [7\u201310] for\nits inadequacy in systems where strong correlations dominate. The band structure\nlimit of nearly free electrons [11] is not an appropriate starting point and one should\napproach the problem with the interactions considered on an equal footing with the\nkinetic energy of the system [8,12\u201315]. With this in mind we define strongly correlated\nsystems as being those in which interactions have a profound effect on the ground\nstate and the low-lying excitations. Examples include transition metal oxides [15],\nheavy fermion compounds [16\u201319], quantum Hall systems [5,20\u201323], high-temperature\nsuperconductors, [10, 24] and one dimensional (1D) electronic systems [25\u201328] among\nothers.\nOne dimensional electronic systems are inherently correlated. Due to the reduced\nphase space in 1D these systems behave in a way which is radically different from their\nhigher dimensional counterparts, two and three dimensional electronic systems [1,11].\nThe usual concept of an electron-like elementary excitation gives away to a more exotic\nclass of fractionalized excitations referred to as the spinon and the holon. These\ncollective spin and charge modes, respectively, are the stable elementary excitations\nof the interacting 1D electron liquid and they propagate with different velocities,\n\n\f2\na phenomenon referred to as spin-charge separation [25]. In a spirit similar to the\nLandau Fermi liquid theory, the paradigm for describing the 1D systems where the\nstable elementary spin and charge excitation fields have not acquired an expectation\nvalue (i.e. gapless) is called Luttinger liquid [7, 25, 26] - a terminology coined by\nHaldane [28].\nInteracting 1D electrons in the Luttinger liquid phase are characterized by spincharge separation [29\u201331], suppression of the density of states near the Fermi level,\nand a power law behavior in the correlation functions. Experimental evidence for\nLuttinger liquid behavior has been reported in many 1D systems, via, e.g., a suppression of the density of states near the Fermi level in ropes of carbon nanotubes [32]\nor power law behavior in the conductance vs. temperature in edge states of the fractional quantum Hall effect [33, 34] and carbon nanotubes [35]. Direct evidence of\nspin-charge separation is evident in the measured single hole spectral function of the\nMott-Hubbard insulator SrCuO2 [36].\nA useful quantity to detect spin-charge separation is the finite temperature single hole spectral function [37] relevant in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) experiments. In the literature, theoretical analyses of this effect have mostly\nbeen performed for the zero temperature spectral function [38, 39] of the Luttinger\nliquid. Since experiments are performed at nonzero temperatures a reliable comparison between theory and experiment can only be made with the finite temperature\nspectral functions, as described in chapter 5.\nIn nature there are materials which are quasi-1D [7, 40, 41]. Experimental data\non their electronic structure and theoretical analysis of these compounds [10, 42\u201369]\nsupports the idea that there may be a temperature regime where the electronic structure can be characterized as 1D. Luttinger liquid physics or other instabilities of the\ninteracting 1D electron liquid are then usually assumed to provide a correct physical description of the ground state. However there are many assumptions behind\nthis [5, 10]. Furthermore, being quasi-1D in nature these systems do not allow theoretical ideas [8, 26] and techniques which have been primarily developed for true\n\n\f3\n1D problems to be tested. Fortunately advances in semiconductor device fabrication technology have led experimentalists to create systems such as quantum wires\n(QWR's) [70\u201373] and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [74\u201376] which are more fitting as\nexamples of a 1D system. The aluminum arsenide (AlAs) QWR studied in this dissertation is such an example.\nThis dissertation focuses on two projects. The first is concerned with characterizing the ground state electronic phase diagram of an AlAs QWR. Using 1D field\ntheoretic methods involving abelian bosonization and the renormalization group this\nQWR is shown to have a spin gapped electronic phase of matter with a novel singlet\nsuperconducting ground state arising due to the unique umklapp interaction present\nin the AlAs bandstructure. The singlet state has Cooper pairs which carry a finite\npairing momentum. This dissertation also presents a theoretical analysis of the finite\ntemperature single hole Luttinger liquid spectral function measured in the ARPES\nexperiments. The results predict a kink in the effective electronic dispersion of the\nfinite temperature Luttinger liquid. Being a finite temperature effect all previous\nanalyses which focused on the zero temperature spectral function had failed to capture this feature in the electronic dispersion. The kink analysis provides a way to\ndetect spin-charge separation in 1D systems where the spin peak is muted due to\nrepulsive interactions.\nThe dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction\nto 1D strongly correlated systems. Chapter 2 presents the reasons for studying the\nsystems and the main motivation behind the projects. Chapter 3 introduces the\ninteracting 1D electron liquid and, provides a brief overview of bosonization, the\nrenormalization group, and the finite temperature spectral function of the Luttinger\nliquid. Chapter 4 focuses on the model Hamiltonian used to study the AlAs QWR, the\ninteractions present, the RG approach applied to the system, and finally a discussion\nof the resulting phase diagram of the AlAs QWR. Chapter 5 presents the work on the\nfinite temperature single hole spectral function of the Luttinger liquid. These chapters\nare followed by a list of references and appendices which detail the calculations.\n\n\f4\n\n2. GROUND STATES AND EXPERIMENTAL\nSIGNATURES\nOne of the challenging and motivating aspect of 1D strongly correlated physics is\nto determine, characterize, and explain the nature of electronic phases of matter\narising from an interplay of strong electronic correlations and low dimensionality.\nExperimental signatures of these systems are equally intriguing [77].\nIn general, strongly correlated systems [8, 12] can support a rich variety of novel\nelectronic phases of matter like high-temperature superconductivity in ceramic layered copper-oxide materials [10] and quantum Hall states [23] in the two dimensional\nelectron gas. Some of the exotic ground states also appear in magnetic systems where\nthe electronic spins can order on long length-scales and give rise to low-energy magnetic excitations called spin-waves [8, 12, 78]. The spin degrees of freedom could also\nbe correlated only on short length-scales and have gapped (confined) excitations. This\nis the \"spin liquid\" phase [79]. In most cases variation of the external parameters such\nas temperature, pressure or chemical doping can help tune transitions from one novel\nground state to another [9]. Novel quantum phase transitions can also be realized in\nartificially engineered 1D nanostructures such as QWR's where the electrons move\nalong one direction but their transverse motions are quantum mechanically confined.\nExperimental probes capable of detecting Luttinger liquid physics include ARPES\n[6], tunneling measurements [80], neutron scattering [81], and conductance measurements [70,71]. ARPES and neutron scattering experiments are primarily used for the\nquasi-1D materials. The tunneling and conductance measurements are employed for\nthe QWR and carbon nanotube systems.\nLaboratory fabricated 1D systems, such as a QWR, present to us a unique challenge of studying a genre of correlated electron device in which there is a theoretically\n\n\f5\ncontrolled way of incorporating strong electron correlations. From a broader perspective because the device parameters in a QWR are experimentally tunable, they offer\na genuine opportunity to study transitions between ground states in 1D, for example, charge-density-wave (CDW) to singlet superconductivity (SS). The AlAs QWR\nstudied in this dissertation encourages the CDW and the SS electronic phases. In\ngeneral, QWR systems allow to confirm 1D theories in a way that is not possible\nin bulk three dimensional materials or quasi-1D materials (since bulk materials are\nnever really 1D) [7, 10]. There is a tremendous potential to control these physical\nsystems we study as an aid to test theoretical predictions, and perhaps even paving\nthe way towards designing new composite materials.\nSpin-charge separation in quasi-1D systems can be probed using ARPES measurements which measure the single hole spectral function. The effect can be hard to\ndetect experimentally due to interactions, finite temperature and experimental resolution. This dissertation presents a theoretical analysis of the finite temperature\nsingle hole Luttinger liquid spectral function [37] which predicts a kink in the effective electronic dispersion. This unique signature, a result of finite temperature and\ninteractions had been overlooked previously.\n\n2.1\n\nNovel electronic ground states in a quantum wire\nA QWR is an excellent realization of a 1D system [70\u201373,82,83] on which controlled\n\nexperiments and theoretical calculations [84\u201388] can be performed. 1D combined with\nstrong interactions cause the QWR's to display markedly non-Fermi liquid behavior\n[70, 71, 84\u201387].\nAlAs is a heavy mass system with degenerate valleys and anisotropic mass. By\nexploiting the valley degeneracy in AlAs, a single QWR has recently been fabricated\nwith two degenerate nonoverlapping bands separated in momentum-space by half an\numklapp vector (kU ) [89, 90], as illustrated in Fig. 4.3(b), using the cleaved edge\novergrowth technique. The arrangement of the bands in momentum-space allows for\n\n\f6\nthe possibility of multiple Fermi points (more than the usual case of two from a single\nband) at the Fermi energy (see Fig. 3.3(a)). The presence of multiple Fermi points\nimplies multiple charge and spin channels, causing a rich phase diagram. Multiple\nFermi points have been a recurring experimental and theoretical theme in recent years\nwithin the context of quasi-one dimensional systems [7, 40\u201354, 56\u201368, 91, 92]. In the\ncontext of these 1D AlAs QWR systems they are exciting because of the potential\nfor experimentally accessible new ground states. The multiple Fermi points in this\nsystem are present even at the lowest densities. They have a new class of interactions,\nthe everpresent umklapp interaction (see Fig. 4.5(e)), which has the possibility to\nfavor exotic electronic phases of matter; as described in chapter 4. Specifically, a SS\nstate with Cooper pairs carrying a finite pairing momentum is encouraged. Such a\nstate is a realization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but in the\npresent context for an interacting 1D system. This is known to lead to inhomogeneous\nsuperconductivity [93].\nOne dimension is characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. This prevents\nlong-range order from developing in these system at finite temperatures. However, in\norder to realize a true long-range order and a phase transition at a finite temperature\none can couple a set of 1D systems to dimensionally crossover to a two dimensional\nsystem [94]. For e.g., in the present context an array of QWR's could be fabricated\nto investigate dimensional crossover from a 1D to a two dimensional system.\n\n2.2\n\nExperimental signature of spin-charge separation\nThe interacting 1D electron liquid is characterized by spin-charge separation where\n\nthe stable elementary excitations, the holon and the spinon, propagate with different\nvelocities. This is expected to give rise to separate spin and charge peaks in the single hole spectral function of the Luttinger liquid. Until recently a clear experimental\ndetection of these two peaks has proven difficult, since the combined effects of interactions, thermal broadening, and finite experimental resolution can suppress the spin\n\n\f7\npeak for repulsive interactions. The measured peak in the effective electronic dispersion propagates with a combination of the spin and charge velocity at low energies\nbut with only the charge velocity at high energies. This change in velocity gives rise\nto a kink in the effective electronic dispersion. A systematic study of the temperature\nand interaction dependence of this kink has been performed in this dissertation. This\nis an useful experimental signature especially when the two peaks are not directly\nvisible in the Luttinger liquid spectral function to confirm the spin-charge separated\nnature of the material under investigation.\nAngle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on SrCuO2 [36] have measured spin-charge separation by detecting the spin and charge dispersions separately in\nthe single hole spectral function. Previous attempts to confirm spin-charge separation\nthrough detection of separately dispersing spin and charge peaks with ARPES [95,96]\nhave been overturned [97, 98], or lack independent verification of the spin and charge\nenergy scales [99]. Indirect experimental evidence of spin-charge separation in 1D systems also exists. For example, the tunneling measurements via real-space imaging of\nFriedel oscillations using scanning tunneling microscopy on single-walled carbon nanotubes [100] and momentum- and energy- resolved tunneling between two coupled\nQWRs [80].\nTheoretical analysis of the finite temperature single hole spectral function [77] indicates that within Luttinger liquid theory, the spinon branch is suppressed compared\nto the holon branch for repulsive interactions. This presents a difficulty in directly\nconfirming spin and charge dispersions through measurements proportional to the\nsingle particle spectral function. Nevertheless spin-charge separation can be detected\nvia the systematic temperature dependence of a kink in the electronic dispersion, even\nin cases where the spin peak is not directly resolvable, as described in chapter 5.\n\n\f8\n\n3. INTERACTING ONE DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON\nLIQUID\n3.1\n\nLuttinger liquid paradigm and Bosonization\nInteractions have drastic effects in 1D compared to higher dimensions. As a conse-\n\nquence of strong electron-electron interactions the familiar concept of an electron-like\nquasiparticle has no meaning. Due to the reduced phase space individual motion of\nan electron is impossible (see Fig. 3.1), and all the stable elementary excitations are\ncollective (see Fig. 3.2). A single fermionic excitation appears to split into a collec-\n\nFigure 3.1. In a 1D interacting system an individual electron cannot move\nwithout pushing all the neighboring electrons. As a result only collective\nexcitations can exist [25].\n\ntive excitation carrying charge (holon) and another collective excitation carrying spin\n(spinon). The electron is said to have 'fractionalized'. This is spin-charge separation\nwhere the collective charge and spin modes have in general different velocities. The\nminimal quantum numbers of the gapless modes are charge, spin, and (crystal) momentum. Here the \"spin-modes\" have spin 1/2 and charge 0 (spinon), and \"charge\nmodes\" have spin 0 and charge e (holon). This is the interacting 1D electron gas\nwhere the bosonic quasiparticles are the key to solving our 1D problem. In this context it is important to note that the Luttinger liquid is a particular phase of the 1D\nelectron gas where all the charge and spin modes are gapless [25]. The notion of a\nLuttinger liquid implies that all gapless 1D electronic systems share these properties\nat low energies [28].\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c9\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n\u03c9\n\nPSfrag replacements\nvF q\n0\n\n2kF\n\nq\n\n(a) Two and three dimensions\n\n0\n\n2kF\n\nq\n\n(b) One dimension\n\nFigure 3.2.

Interactions cannot form\ncoherently propagating particle-hole pairs. (b) Contrary to higher dimensions, in one dimension due to the reduced phase space the only allowed\nlow-energy excitations are for the two Fermi points, q = 0 and q = 2kF .\nParticle-hole excitations now have both a well defined energy and momentum for \u03c9 \u2192 0 and q \u2192 0. A coherently propagating particle-hole pair can\nnow form with a result that collective bosonic excitations are stable [25].\n\nThe particle-hole spectrum (see Fig. 3.2) holds the key to understanding the nature\nof the stable elementary excitations in 1D. In the low energy (\u03c9 \u2192 0) and low\nmomentum limit (q \u2192 0), particle-hole excitations in 1D form stable collective bosonic\nexcitations which become the basis for solving the 1D models. As shown in Fig. 3.2\na particle-hole pair in two and three dimensions can have a continuum of energies\nextending from zero for q < 2kF . Any electron-hole pair which tries to propagate\ncoherently decays immediately into the electron-hole continuum. However in 1D,\ndue to the Pauli exclusion principle there is a volume of excluded phase space (see\nFig. 3.2). The only allowed low-energy excitations are for the two Fermi points, q = 0\nand q = 2kF .

Now we use\nthe basic idea of bosonization where we associate with the right- and left- moving\nfermionic fields a corresponding bosonic field.

In the later\ncase spin-charge separation can be formally defined as a statement where the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a sum of two pieces involving only charge or spin fields\nin the absence of interactions mixing spin and charge modes in the bosonic theory.\nThe phenomenon of spin-charge separation holds for the spinfull problem even in the\npresence of forward and back-scattering fermionic interactions [25, 101].\nPhysically \u03c6\u03c1 and \u03c6\u03c3 are the phases of the charge density wave (CDW) and spin\ndensity wave (SDW) fluctuations, and \u03b8\u03c1 is the superconducting phase. The parameter K\u03bd , a measure of the electron-electron interaction strength in the theory, is\nreferred to as the Luttinger parameter, see appendix A. For K = 1, it refers to a\nnon-interacting theory. The repulsive and attractive regimes are given by K < 1 and\n\n\f12\nK > 1 for repulsive and attractive interactions respectively. Furthermore, K\u03c3 = 1 for\nsystems in which there are no explicit spin symmetry breaking fields or spontaneous\nbreakdown of spin-rotation invariance. The velocities for the charge and spin modes\nare given by v\u03bd where \u03bd = \u03c1, \u03c3.\nIt is a salient feature of the 1D electron gas that all the properties of such systems,\nincluding fermionic correlation functions, can be expressed in terms of the bosonic\nfields (apart from the Klein factors) [101\u2013103]. Any 1D problem involving only the\nforward scattering interactions can be solved exactly by using the boson representation\nin which it is non-interacting [25\u201327]. Furthermore it is advantageous that when\nspin-charge separation holds the Hamiltonian is separable, and so wavefunctions, and\ntherefore correlation functions, factor.\nThe effects of some perturbations on the low energy properties of Luttinger liquids can be studied using the renormalization group idea. In considering the 1D AlAs\nQWR model, as described in chapter 4, where such a situation may arise we employ\nthis scheme to study the phase diagram. We focus on the long distance physics\n\n\u039b\n\n\u039b/b\n\n\u039b/b\n\n\u039b\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nFigure 3.4.

The coupling\nconstants which appear in the problem are then effective parameters and implicitly\ninclude much of the high energy physics.

The procedure\ninvolves in thinning the degrees of freedom followed by a rescaling of length scales.\nThe physics of the problem is then studied by investigating the dependence of the\ncoupling constants on the length scale.

PHASE DIAGRAM OF THE ALUMINUM ARSENIDE\nQUANTUM WIRE\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\nIn the usual realization of a QWR, transverse quantization leads to a succession of\n\nnested energy bands. While much of the attention has been focused on elucidating the\ntheoretical properties of a single band QWR [65,84\u201387,110\u2013112], there is a theoretical\nand practical urgency to focus on the novel phenomena which may arise in these\nsystems when more than one energy band is involved. A theoretical attempt has been\n\nFigure 4.1. Aluminum arsenide quantum wire fabricated using the cleaved\nedge overgrowth technique. The notation 2DEG refers to the two dimensional electron gas which couples to the quantum wire from either side.\nPicture courtesy of Dr. M. Rother, Ph.D Thesis (2000), Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany.\n\nmade in this direction by Starykh et.al. [110] where they examined and demonstrated\n\n\f16\nthe possibility of gapped phases in a QWR focusing on the nested bandstructure\narrangement (see Fig. 4.2) which arises due to the quantum confinement. According to\ntheir theoretical proposal when the electronic density in such a system is tuned so that\nthe lowest two successive energy levels are occupied, there are gapped phases possible,\nfor e.g., an interband CDW, with anti-correlated charge density waves in each band,\nand a \"Cooper phase\" at zero pairing momenta with strong singlet superconducting\nfluctuations. However due to the possibility of density reorganization (see Fig 4.2) a\nmechanism in which it becomes energetically favorable for the two lowest subbands\nto match their densities, the interband CDW is the most likely state. The Cooper\nphase may exist just as the second band becomes occupied, when the difference in\nFermi momenta is the largest [110].\nIn this regard one of the questions which could be posed is the following: Is there\na possibility of a robust superconducting phase with a spin gap in a multiple Fermi\npoint QWR? To answer the question we consider the theoretical treatment of an AlAs\nQWR which has been recently fabricated by Moser et.al. [89, 90] using the cleaved\nedge overgrowth technique [70] (see Fig. 4.1). Our calculations indicate that in the\nclean limit (i.e. no disorder) this QWR has the possibility to realize a spin gap with\na stable SS phase with finite pairing momentum. The finite pairing of the Cooper\npairs is an indication of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state which is\nknown to lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity [93].\nAlAs is a heavy mass semiconductor with three degenerate valleys in the first Brillouin zone and anisotropic mass [113]. The arrangement of the bands in momentumspace makes it an ideal candidate for a system where multiple Fermi points are present\neven at the lowest densities. There are two degenerate nonoverlapping bands separated in momentum-space by half an umklapp vector (kU ), as illustrated in Fig. 4.3.\nFor low densities with only the lowest bands of transverse quantization occupied, the\ndensity-reorganizing interband CDW instability discussed above is forbidden. In addition, since the two (degenerate) band minima are connected by half an umklapp\nvector, there is a class of umklapp excitations unique to this bandstructure which\n\n\f17\nexist at all densities (see Fig. 4.5(e)) and which have the possibility to favor novel\nelectronic phases.\n\nE\nk\nPSfrag replacements\n\nFigure 4.2. Bandstructure of a quantum wire where there is only one\nband of lowest energy. When the first two bands are filled, interactions\nbetween the four Fermi points lead to gaps. The possibility of density\nreorganization is shown, in which it becomes energeticaly favorable for the\nfirst two subbands to match their Fermi momenta. This costs the kinetic\nenergy of moving the densities away from the noninteracting values, but\ngains the CDW gap energy [110]. The notations E and k refer to energy\nand momentum respectively.\n\nIn this chapter, we use abelian bosonization and the weak coupling renormalization group scheme to theoretically characterize this QWR. We find that for repulsive\ninteractions, the wire can be tuned so that the ground state has a spin gap which\nfavors either a divergent CDW correlation function or a divergent singlet superconducting correlation function with finite pairing momenta for the Cooper pairs. Even\nthough the original problem contains a repulsive electron-electron interaction, there is\na possibility of generating an effective attraction between the electrons in the course\nof renormalization of the electron-electron interaction. Such a repulsion induced superconductivity is a novel realization in itself and the fact that a mesoscopic system\nsuch as the AlAs QWR discussed in this dissertation can allow for its physical realization is a great source of excitement. The final phase has one gapless (total) charge\n\n\f18\nmode with no gapless spin modes. In the literature this is also referred to as the C1S0\nphase [42, 57, 64, 110].\nThe outline of this chapter is as follows. In section 4.2 we describe the AlAs bandstructure. In section 4.3 we state the model Hamiltonian used to describe the AlAs\nQWR and classify the low energy long wavelength fermionic interaction processes\nwhich are important. In section 4.4 we bosonize the Hamiltonian in a symmetric and\nan anti-symmetric basis of the bosonic fields constructed from the two bands A and\nB (see Fig. 4.3(b)). In section 4.5 we derive the renormalization group equations and\ndiscuss the electronic phase diagram. In section 4.6 we state the conclusions.\n\n4.2\n\nQuantum wire bandstructure\nIn bulk AlAs, conduction-band minima (or valleys) occur at the six equivalent X-\n\npoints of the Brillouin zone. The constant energy surface consists of six half ellipsoids\n(three full ellipsoids in the first Brillouin zone), with their major axes along one of\nthe h100i directions. These valleys are highly anisotropic with an anisotropic effective\nmass of 1.1me in the longitudinal direction and 0.19me in the transverse direction,\nwhere me is the bare mass of the electron. Since a large effective mass leads to\na reduced kinetic energy, many-body effects related to the Coulomb potential are\nexpected to be enhanced in AlAs compared to the light-mass, 0.067me , GaAs system.\nIn the AlAs QWR fabricated by the cleaved edge overgrowth process [70, 90], the\ninitial growth direction is along [001] with the AlAs layer flanked by GaAs and AlGaAs\non either side. This creates the two dimensional electron gas. To prepare the QWR\nthe heterostructure is then cleaved in the perpendicular direction specified by [110]\n(the cleavage plane). The 1D channel thus formed at the edge of the cleaved plane\ntogether with the tantulum gate deposited on top of the two dimensional electron gas\nthen helps to define the length of the QWR.\nThe bandstructure of the QWR can be estimated, approximately, by taking slices\nthrough the bandstructure of the corresponding two or three dimensional material.\n\n\f19\nFor special systems such as CNTs, which have cylindrical boundary conditions one can\njust take slices with various transverse momenta which is a good quantum number\nin these systems. However, most other physical systems do not have such elegant\nboundary conditions, and in general there will be boundary reflections that mix states\nof different transverse momenta. The effect of this is that the dispersion of the lowest\nlying band, rather than corresponding to a slice along a particular constant transverse\nmomentum, corresponds instead to a slice that tracks the minimum of the two or three\ndimensional dispersion relation.\nFor the cleaved edge AlAs QWR when one performs this analysis [115] we obtain\nthe bandstructure arrangement as shown in Fig. 4.3(b). In the lowest lying band\nthe transverse momentum has no role to play. The bandstructure consists of two\ndegenerate bands A and B, as shown in Fig. 4.3(b), referring to the degenerate X and\nY valleys in the AlAs bandstructure (see Fig. 4.3(a)). Even at the lowest densities,\nthere are two degenerate subbands. In addition, the band minima are separated by\nhalf an umklapp vector, kU /2, giving rise to umklapp interactions which are present\nat all fillings and is not related to the commensurability of the electron gas with the\nunderlying lattice. The four Fermi points, represented by black dots in Fig. 4.3(a)\nand Fig. 4.3(b), are at kFA\u00b1 = \u2212 k4U \u00b1 kFo and kFB\u00b1 =\n\nkU\n4\n\n\u00b1 kFo where kU is the umklapp\n\nvector, and kFo is the magnitude of the Fermi wavevector measured from the bottom\n\nof each band.\nWe also note that the band structure of AlAs electrons is similar to Si, except\nthat in Si there are six ellipsoids centered around six equivalent points along the \u2206lines of the Brillouin zone, while in AlAs we have three (six half) ellipsoids at the\nX-points. Typically these valleys are denoted by the directions of their major axes:\nX, Y, and Z for the [100], [010], and [001] valleys, respectively. For our purposes\na crucial difference between AlAs and Si is the manner in which the valleys are\noccupied in a quantum well from which eventually the QWRs are fabricated. When\nthe electrons are confined along the [001] direction in a (001) Si-MOSFET or a Si/SiGe heterostructure, the two Z valleys, with their major axes pointing out of plane, are\n\n\f20\n\nY-valley\n\u0393\n\nky\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nX-valley\n\nkx\nPSfrag replacements\n\n(a) Two valleys, four Fermi points\n\nA\n\nE\n\nB\nk\n\nkU\n2\n\n(b) Quantum wire bandstructure wire\n\nFigure 4.3. (a)The aluminum arsenide quantum wire bandstructure considered here has the four Fermi points indicated in the diagram. The\ntwo ellipses refer to the degenerate X and Y valleys [114] situated at the\nX-point (indicated by the open circle) of the Brillouin zone. Note the energy minimum for aluminum arsenide is not at the \u0393-point. The distance\nbetween the two open circles is half an umklapp vector. (b)In our calculation the quantum wire bandstructure is modelled with the two degenerate\nbands labeled A and B referring to the degenerate X and Y valleys in an\naluminum arsenide bandstructure. Even at the lowest densities, there are\ntwo degenerate subbands. In addition, the band minima are separated by\nhalf an umklapp vector, kU /2, giving rise to new \"umklapp\" interactions\nwhich are present at all fillings. The Fermi points, represented by black\ndots on the figure, are at kFA\u00b1 = \u2212 k4U \u00b1 kFo and kFB\u00b1 = k4U \u00b1 kFo where kU\nis the umklapp vector, and kFo is the magnitude of the Fermi wavevector\nmeasured from the bottom of each band. The notations E and k refer to\nenergy and momentum respectively.\n\n\f21\noccupied because the larger mass of electrons along the confinement direction lowers\ntheir energy. In AlAs quantum wells grown on a (001) GaAs substrate, however, the\nZ valley is occupied only if the well thickness is less than approximately 5 nm [116].\nFor larger well thicknesses, a biaxial compression of the AlAs layer, induced by the\nlattice mismatch between AlAs and GaAs, causes the X and Y valleys with their\nmajor axes lying in the plane to be occupied [113]. For the AlAs QWR fabricated by\nMoser et.al. [90] using the cleaved edge overgrowth technique (see Fig. 4.3), the well\nthickness is 15 nm. As a result the X and Y valleys are lower in energy and provide\nthe two degenerate conduction bands which can be occupied by electrons. For Si such\na possibility is precluded as stated above.\nThere are also crucial differences between the AlAs QWR and the CNT bandstructure. In the CNTs the two bands, around the Dirac points, between which the\nelectron-electron scattering processes take place are not separated by half an umklapp\nvector as in the AlAs QWR [74]. Furthermore, the umklapp interactions which are\ngenerated in the CNT systems are present only at half-fillings and not just at any\nelectronic density. At half-filling, a metallic CNT maps to the Hubbard model also\nat half-filling. While the Hubbard model has umklapps at half-filling, these do not\ncorrespond to umklapps in the original CNT. Rather, they are merely extra interactions which are only allowed by symmetry at the Dirac points, i.e. at half-filling.\nAlso, a metallic tube is unlike our QWR, in that the pseudospin which is equivalent\nto the sublattice quantum number prevents an electron from backscattering from one\nbranch to another around the same Brillouin zone points. A doped semiconducting\ntube could perhaps do this. We in fact do include backscattering within the same\nsubband which is strictly forbidden in a metallic CNT.\nFurthermore, empirical evidence [114, 116] suggests that in an AlAs quantum well\nthe spin degeneracy is not lifted in the absence of magnetic field leading us to conclude\nthat spin-orbit coupling effects can be safely ignored in the theoretical formulation of\nthe present problem.\n\n\f22\n4.3\n\nThe Fermionic Hamiltonian\nIn a QWR electrons are quantum mechanically confined to move along one direc-\n\ntion with their motion in the remaining transverse directions confined via a potential Vconf (r~\u22a5 ) where ~r\u22a5 = (y, z) denotes the transverse coordinates of quantization.\nElectron-electron interactions within the wire are described by U(~r) which is purely\nrepulsive. The Hamiltonian is a sum of two independent terms in the transverse and\nlongitudinal directions with the result that the wavefunction (and therefore the correlation functions) can be decomposed as a product of \u03c6(~r\u22a5 ) and \u03c8s (x) where \u03c6(~r\u22a5 ) is\nthe orthogonal wavefunction of transverse quantization of the two degenerate bands\n(X and Y valleys) and \u03c8s (x) the longitudinal part. In order to describe the physics\nalong the longitudinal direction we now promote the wavefunction, \u03c8s (x), to the level\nof a field operator (for a field theoretic description) responsible for creating and annihilating the electrons taking part in the various scattering processes. With this in\nmind the second quantized Hamiltonian suitable for our purposes of study is\nH=\n\nXZ\n\nd\n\ns\n\n1X\n+\n2 s,s\u2032\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nr\u03a8\u2020s (~r)\n\n1 ~2\n\u2212\n\u2207 \u2212 \u03bc + Vconf (~r\u22a5 ) \u03a8s (~r)\n2m r\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd3 rd3 r U(~r \u2212 r~\u2032 )\u03a8\u2020s (~r)\u03a8\u2020s\u2032 (~r )\u03a8s\u2032 (~r )\u03a8s (~r)\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03a8s (~r) = \u03c6(~r\u22a5 )\u03c8s (x) is now the field operator for an electron species of spin\ns = {\u2191, \u2193}, and \u03bc is the chemical potential in the leads. Because the low energy, long\nwavelength excitations occur around the vicinity of the Fermi points (see Fig. 4.3(b))\na further decomposition is possible with \u03a8s (~r) = \u03c6(~r\u22a5 )(\u03c8As (x) + \u03c8Bs (x)). The coordinate x is in the long direction of the wire. The longitudinal part of the field can\nbe naturally expanded in terms of the right- and left- moving excitations, Rns (x) and\nLns (x), respectively, residing around the Fermi points of the two bands (indicated\nA+\n\nby the black dots in Fig. 4.3(b)) with \u03c8As (x) = RAs (x)eikF\nB+\nikF\nx\n\n\u03c8Bs (x) = RBs (x)e\n\nB\u2212\nikF\nx\n\n+ LBs (x)e\n\nx\n\nA\u2212\n\n+ LAs (x)eikF\n\nx\n\nand\n\n.

The first type describes the interaction of electrons within the same band,\nF\nB\nn = A, B, and contains the forward (Uintra\n) and the backward scattering (Uintra\n)\n\nprocesses. These are referred to as the intraband interaction processes. The second\ntype describes electron-electron scattering processes involving both bands, classified\nas interband interactions. The relevant interband interaction terms in the fermionic\nB\nlanguage include forward (UF ), backward (UdB , UxB and Uinter\n), and inter-valley umk-\n\nlapp (Uum ) scattering.

The backscattering\nterm has three types - direct, exchange and interband. We define direct backscattering, UB\nd , as an event where backscattering processes occur in each band separately\n(see Fig. 4.5(b)). Exchange backscattering, UB\nx , has the same initial and final states\nas direct backscattering, but the electrons switch bands (see Fig. 4.5(c)). Interband\nB\nbackscattering, Uinter\n, is backscattering between two electrons in different bands (see\n\nFig. 4.5(d)). The inter-valley umklapp scattering is unique to this bandstructure (see\nFig. 4.5(e)). It is a scattering process where two electrons starting, for e.g., in band\nA with total momentum -kU /2 scatter into band B, with total momentum kU /2. The\nmomentum difference between the initial and final states is an umklapp vector which\ncan be exchanged with the lattice. This is an umklapp process which is present at\nall densities and is not related to the commensurability of the electron gas with the\nunderlying lattice. It is unique to the AlAs QWR bandstructure and as we shall see\nlater will play an important role in classifying the phase diagram.\n\n4.4\n\nBosonizing the Hamiltonian\nThe low energy properties of the interacting 1D electron gas can be conveniently\n\ndescribed within the framework of the bosonization technique [7, 25\u201327]. Within this\napproach one can associate with the right- and left- moving, Rns (x) and Lns (x),\nrespectively, fermionic field operators a combination of bosonic fields \u03c6n\u03bd = (\u03c6n\u2191 \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c6n\u2193 )/ 2 and \u03b8n\u03bd = (\u03b8n\u2191 \u00b1\u03b8n\u2193 )/ 2, where \u03bd = \u03c1, \u03c3 (the charge and spin modes) correspond to the \u00b1 combination, s = {\u2191, \u2193} is the spin index and n = A, B is the band in-\n\n\f27\nE\nPSfrag replacements\nk\n\n(a) Forward scattering (U F )\n\nE\nPSfrag replacements\nk\n\n(b) Direct backscattering (UdB )\n\nE\nPSfrag replacements\nk\n\n(c) Exchange backscattering (UxB )\n\nE\nPSfrag replacements\nk\n\nB\n(d) Interband backscattering (Uinter\n)\n\nE\nPSfrag replacements\nk\n\n(e) Inter-valley umklapp scattering (Uum )\n\nFigure 4.5.

The Fermi points are at kFA\u00b1 = \u2212 k4U \u00b1 kFo\nand kFB\u00b1 = k4U \u00b1 kFo (as described in Fig. 4.3(b)) where kU is the umklapp vector, and kFo is the magnitude of the Fermi wavevector measured\nfrom the bottom of each band. The inter-valley umklapp scattering (Fig.\n4.5(e)) shown above is unique to this aluminum arsenide quantum wire\nbandstructure arrangement.\n\n\f28\n\u2032\n\ndex.

They are required\nto preserve the anti-commutation relations of the fermionic fields. The convenient\nfield variables for the Hamiltonian in our problem will be a linear combination of the\nboson fields constructed out of the two bands. We define the transformation to a\nsymmetric and an anti-symmetric basis as \u03c6\u00b1\n\u03bd =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03c6A\u03bd\n2\n\n\u00b1 \u03c6B\u03bd ) and \u03b8\u03bd\u00b1 =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03b8A\u03bd\n2\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u03b8B\u03bd ). Upon bosonization and subsequent transformation the parts of the Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to free motion produce the harmonic terms in the symmetric and the\n\u00b1\nanti-symmetric bosonic fields (\u03c6\u00b1\n\u03bd and \u03b8\u03bd ) only. The intraband interactions and the\n\ninterband interactions, however, generate both cosine interaction terms and harmonic\nterms. Furthermore while bosonizing we also used the fact that the exponential\neikU x = 1. This is true because the electrons in the QWR move in an underlying\nlattice and their spatial coordinate x = max , where ax is the lattice spacing in the\nlong direction of the wire and m is an integer. When multiplied with the umklapp\nvector, kU = 2\u03c0/ax , and exponentiated the result is exp[\u22122m\u03c0] = 1.\nThe Hamiltonian, H, can be written in the following canonical form\n1 X X\nH=\n2 \u03bc=\u00b1 \u03bd=\u03c1,\u03c3\n\nZ\n\ndR\n\n\u0014\n\nv\u03bd\u03bc K\u03bd\u03bc (\u2202R \u03b8\u03bd\u03bc )2\n\nv\u03bc\n+ \u03bd\u03bc (\u2202R \u03c6\u03bc\u03bd )2 + Hint\nK\u03bd\n\nwhere the bosonic interaction terms, Hint , are\n\u221a\n\u221a\nt1 Z\n+\ndR\ncos[\n4\u03c0\u03c6\n]\ncos[\n4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c3\n\u03c3]\n2\u03c0 2 \u03b12 Z\n\u221a\n\u221a\nt2\n+\n+ 2 2 dR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u03c3 ]\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\n\u221a\n\u221a\nt3\n\u2212\n+ 2 2 dR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u03c3 ]\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\n\nHint =\n\n\u0015\n\n(4.12)\n\n\f29\nt4\n2\u03c0 2 \u03b12 Z\nt5\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt6\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt7\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt8\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt9\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt10\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 Z\nt11\n+ 2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\nZ\n\n+\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n]\ncos[\n4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ]\n\u03c1\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c3]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6+\n\u03c3]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR sin[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ] sin[ 4\u03c0\u03c6+\n\u03c3]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6+\n\u03c3]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c3]\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndR cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1]\n\n(4.13)\n\nwith the coupling constants defined in terms of the Coulomb matrix element M(a)\nt1 = t2 = 2 daM(a) cos[2kFo a]\nt3 = 2 daM(a)\nR\n\nR\n\n\u0012\n\ncos[2kFo a]\n\n\u2212 cos\n\n\u0014\n\nkU a\n2\n\nt4 = t5 = \u2212t10 = \u2212t11 = \u22122 M(a) cos\nt6 = \u2212t9 = \u22122\nt7 = \u22122\n\nR\n\nR\n\ndaM(a) cos[2kFo a] cos\n\ndaM(a) sin[2kFo a] sin\n\nR\n\n\u0012\n\nt8 = 2 daM(a) 1 \u2212\nR\n\n\u0013\n\ncos[2kFo a]\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\nkU a\n2\n\ncos\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u0013\nkU a\n2\n\nkU a\n2\n\n\u0015\n\nkU a\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n(4.14)\n\n\u2032\n\nIn the Hamiltonian, R = (x+x )/2 is the center-of-mass coordinate of two electrons\n\u2032\n\nand a = x \u2212 x their relative coordinate in the long direction of the QWR. In the\nquadratic part the bare symmetric and anti-symmetric Luttinger parameters, K\u03bd\u00b1 ,\nquoted in appendix A, can be expressed in terms of the original Luttinger parameters\nK\u03bd . Furthermore the Luttinger parameters which have been derived here starting\nfrom the Fermionic Hamiltonian, Eq. 4.1, are the bare effective parameters [25]. The\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric velocities v\u03bd\u00b1 , refer appendix A, can also be expressed\nin terms of the original velocities v\u03bd .\nThe coupling constants of the problem are denoted by ti , where i = 1, . . . , 11.\nThey are related to the fourier components of the interaction kernel, M(a), with\n\n\f30\nthe wavevectors of the problem - kU and kFo . It is instructive to observe that the\numklapp vector is independent of the electron density in the QWR whereas kFo is not.\nThis allows for the interesting possibility to tune kFo experimentally and control the\ninitial conditions in the renormalization group equations itself and possibly get oneself\ninto various electronic phases of matter as allowed in an interacting 1D electron gas\nproblem. Also, the initial conditions depend on the QWR parameters - the width\n(w), the length (L), and the distance of the QWR from the back-gate (d).\nThe first bosonized interaction term with the coupling t1 arises from intraband\nbackscattering type processes (refer Fig. 4.4(b)) with a coupling strength which depends on the 2kFo cosine fourier component of the interaction kernel M(a). The\nsecond is a result of the direct backscattering type interaction as shown in Fig. 4.5(b)\nand has a coupling strength equal to that of an intraband backscattering process.\nThis is evident from the diagram of the scattering processes shown in Figs. 4.4(b)\nand 4.5(b). The third interaction term has contributions from both the direct and\nexchange backscattering processes, whereas the fourth term is exclusively generated\nfrom exchange backscattering. The exchange backscattering process has a strength\nwhich depends on the kU /2 cosine fourier component of the interaction kernel M(a).\nThe third interaction term is a combination of both and has the 2kFo and the kU /2\ncosine fourier components. These first four interaction terms have in their bosonized\nexpressions the charge density wave phase \u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 for the relative charge channel in the\n\u2212\n\u2212\nantisymmetric basis together with the spin fields \u03c6+\n\u03c3 , \u03c6\u03c3 , and \u03b8\u03c3 . The next three\n\nterms t5 , t6 , and t7 are generated from the interband backscattering process shown in\n\u2212\n\u2212\nFig. 4.5(d). They involve only the spin fields \u03c6+\n\u03c3 , \u03c6\u03c3 , and \u03b8\u03c3 . For t6 and t7 the cou-\n\npling depends on both the 2kFo and kU /2 cosine fourier component of the interaction\nkernel. The strength of t5 is proportional to\n\nkU\n.\n2\n\nBosonization of the inter-valley umklapp scattering fermionic processes produce\nsix bosonized interaction terms in total. Out of those, two are of the form\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u223c cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3 ] cos[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u03c3 ]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u223c sin[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1\u2212 ] sin[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 ] sin[ 4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c3 ] sin[ 4\u03c0\u03c6\u03c3 ]\n\n(4.15)\n\n\f31\nFrom a purely physical standpoint these terms involve self destructing competing dual\nfields. Furthermore the couplings associated with these interactions can never grow\nsince the perturbations involved have a scaling dimension which is greater than two\nand makes them irrelevant in the renormalization group sense. We therefore ignore\ntheir contribution in computing the renormalization group equations. We retain only\nthe remaining four interaction terms labeled as t8 , t9 , t10 and t11 . All these terms\ninvolve the superconducting phase \u03b8\u03c1\u2212 for the relative charge channel in the antisymmetric basis togther with the spin fields of the problem. Their coupling strength\ndepends on the 2kFo and kU /2 cosine fourier component. Finally we note that the\n+\nHamiltonian remains quadratic in the total charge fields \u03c6+\n\u03c1 and \u03b8\u03c1 .\n\nIn summary, starting from the interacting 1D Hamiltonian (see Eq. 4.1) we have\nclassified the important low energy long wavelength fermionic interaction processes\nand then bosonized them (see Eqs. 4.12 and 4.13). In the next section 4.5 we use\na weak coupling renormalization group treatment, described earlier in chapter 3, to\ndetermine which of the coupling constants associated with the bosonized interaction\nterms diverge.\n\n4.5\n\nAnalyzing the renormalization group equations\nTo analyze the low energy, long wavelength behavior of the interacting system,\n\nwe employ the renormalization group approach. In this approach the shortwavelength modes are systematically eliminated leading to a set of coupled differential\nequations for the coupling constants. For the present problem, one can derive the\nappropriate renormalization group equations for the entire set of interactions, ti ,\nwhere i = 1, . . . , 11, in perturbation theory about the noninteracting fixed point,\nthe quadratic Hamiltonian Eq. 4.12 using the momentum shell renormalization group\nprocedure described in chapter 3. The renormalization group equations for these coupling constants (up to second order, O(2)) of the problem are quoted in appendix\nB.\n\n\f32\nWe study the renormalization group equations for the regimes - K\u03c1\u2212 < 1 (repulsive)\nand K\u03c1\u2212 > 1 (attractive) of the bosonic theory in the relative charge channel. The\n\u2212\nK\u03c1\u2212 < 1 case is repulsive since it promotes the CDW phase, \u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 . The K\u03c1 > 1 case\n\nis attractive because it promotes the SS phase, \u03b8\u03c1\u2212 . The equations are integrated\nnumerically for some suitable initial conditions until one or more couplings grow to\nbe of order one, O(1). The order one O(1) couplings are considered to be large and\nthus pin (gap) the appropriate bosonic modes. We then replace the gapped fields\nwith their expectation value both in the Hamiltonian and in the bosonized version\nof the correlation functions. The correlation functions which do not vanish then help\nto determine the divergent susceptibilities and the possible thermodynamic phase for\nthat regime.\nThe initial condition under which we begin the renormalization group flow is\ndetermined by evaluating the coupling constants, Eq. 4.14, for the QWR parameters\nwidth, length and the distance from the back-gate. The phenomenological form for\nthe interaction kernel is M(a) =\n\ne2 \u221a\ne\u2212(a/d)\n,\n4\u03c0\u01ebo w 2 +a2\n\nwhich has the nature of a screened\n\nCoulomb potential where e is the electronic charge and \u01ebo the permittivity of free\nspace. The screening involves two length scales. The distance of the QWR to the\nback-gate, d, and the width, w, of the wire. The width w provides the short-distance\ncutoff whereas the distance to the back-gate d is the long-distance cutoff. Using these\nparameters and the expression for the coupling constants, Eq. 4.14, we can make an\nestimate for the initial conditions.\nFor the quantum wire of Moser et.al. [89,90] we have a transverse size of w \u223c 15nm\nseparated from the metallic gate by a distance d \u223c 300nm. The wire length is\nL \u223c 1\u03bcm. We then have w/d \u223c 0.05 and the ratio L/d = 10/3. The parameters used\n\nto estimate kFo for the aluminum arsenide bandstructure are: density of the electrons\nin the quantum wire \u223c 108 m\u22121 and the effective mass of the electron m\u2217 = 0.33me\nalong the long direction where me is the bare mass of the electron [90]. Furthermore,\n\nexperimental evidence [114,116] suggests that spin rotational invariance is not broken\n\n\f33\nin the AlAs quantum wells in the absence of a magnetic field. The problem is then\nSU(2) invariant and we can set K\u03c3\u00b1 = 1 to begin the renormalization group flow.\nThe analysis, with the above initial conditions, for the repulsive regime in the\nrelative charge channel, K\u03c1\u2212 < 1, shows that the coupling constants t2 and t3 diverge, in fact (t2 , t3 ) \u2192 (\u221e, \u221e). The fields which get gapped are the antisymmetric\n\u00b1\ncharge field \u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 and the spin fields \u03c6\u03c3 . Their possible acquired expectation values are\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+\n\u2212\n(h\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c1 i, h\u03c6\u03c3 i, h\u03c6\u03c3 i)=(\u00b1 \u03c0/2, 0, 0) or (0, \u00b1 \u03c0/2, \u00b1 \u03c0/2). The final phase in either\n\ncase is a dominant divergent intraband (odd combination) 2kFo -CDW. The corre-\n\nintra,odd\nsponding CDW correlation function, \u00d4CDW,2k\no (refer appendix C), decays with the\nF\n+\n\npower law \u03c7CDW \u223c (1/r)K\u03c1 /2 where K\u03c1+ is the total charge Luttinger parameter.\nAlthough the original screened Coulomb interaction is repulsive, in the course of\nrenormalization it can be led to an effective attractive regime, K\u03c1\u2212 > 1. For this case\nthe renormalization group flows indicate that the divergent coupling constants are\nt9 and t10 where both (t9 , t10 ) \u2192 (\u221e, \u221e). From the interactions terms we can then\ndeduce that the dual antisymmetric charge field \u03b8\u03c1\u2212 gets gapped together with the spin\n\u221a\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nfields \u03c6\u00b1\n\u03c3 . They acquire the expectation values of (h\u03b8\u03c1 i, h\u03c6\u03c3 i, h\u03c6\u03c3 i)=(\u00b1 \u03c0/2, 0, 0) or\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(0, \u00b1 \u03c0/2, \u00b1 \u03c0/2). These gapped fields lead to a state with a divergent intraband SS\n+\n\ncorrelation function \u2206intra,singlet (appendix C) with the power law \u03c7SS \u223c (1/r)1/2K\u03c1 .\nWe also find through our analysis that although for the finite sized wire with\n\nL/d \u223c 3.33, the initial conditions for the renormalization group flows differ from the\ntrue 1D limit of L/d \u2192 \u221e, due to the screening of the back gate this is not a severe\neffect, and the system remains in the same basin of attraction as the infinite wire. The\nrenormalization group results can now be summarized in the phase diagram shown\nin Fig. 4.6\nFor the AlAs QWR bandstructure, due to the presence of four Fermi points we\n\u00b1\nhave in general eight fields, \u03c6\u00b1\n\u03bd and their duals \u03b8\u03bd where \u03bd = \u03c1, \u03c3 refer to the charge\n\nand spin modes. For a gapless system, Luttinger liquid, we would have a C2S2 phase\nwhere the notation refers to the number of gapless charge (C) and spin (S) modes.

The notation CDW\nstands for charge density wave and SS for singlet superconducitvity. In\nthe diagram kp denotes the pairing momenta of the center-of-mass of the\nCooper pairs. The finite pairing momentum is an indication of a FuldeFerrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state which is encouraged in this wire\ndue to the presence of the umklapp interactions. Such a state is also known\nto lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity.\n\nby the renormalization analysis get gapped. Furthermore, due to the absence of any\nbosonized interaction terms in the total charge mode we expect the total charge field\nto remain gapless. As a result we have the C1S0 phase [42, 64] where the notation\nrefers to one gapless total charge mode (\u03c6+\n\u03c1 ) with all other charge and spin modes\ngapped.\nOne of the novel aspects of this superconductivity is that it originated from a\npurely repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. In the process of renormalization, in\nthe relative charge channel for K\u03c1\u2212 > 1, an attractive interaction was generated. This\nresulted in a pairing of up and down spins within a band and subsequent scattering of\nit from one band to another via the umklapp Cooper scattering process. Energetically\nthe process can be understood as a competition between Coulomb repulsion of pairing\nand the kinetic energy of the pair where the latter wins. Such a kinetic energy driven\nmechanism for superconductivity has been proposed earlier in the context of high\ntemperature superconductors [57].\nAnother unique aspect of this superconductivity is that the pairing momenta of the\nCooper pairs is nonzero. It is half the umklapp vector. Being at a finite wavevector\n\n\f35\none could think of this as a density modulated superconducting state where the\nsuperfluid density varies from one lattice site to another with the wavevector\n\nkU\n.\n2\n\nSuch\n\nan inhomogeneous superconducting state is known to arise in the FFLO state [93].\n\n4.6\n\nConclusion\nQWRs provide an opportunity for technological innovation. In this context a\n\nphase diagram helps to understand what electronic phase the QWR may predominantly find itself in since it has an important effect on the transport properties. In\nthis paper we have investigated the possibility of a spin gapped AlAs QWR. Using\n1D field theoretic methods and perturbative renormalization group we are able to\nconclude that the novel AlAs QWR, fabricated by Moser et al. [89, 90] under investigation will have the possibility of a spin gapped state with divergent 2kFo -CDW or\nSS fluctuations. While the CDW wave phase is robust deep in the repulsive region,\nthere is a part of the phase diagram which promotes a non-trivial SS with finitemomentum Cooper pairing leading to an inhomogeneous superconducting state. The\nfinite pairing momentum is an indication of a FFLO state.\n\n\f36\n\n5. LUTTINGER LIQUID KINK\n5.1\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the most dramatic consequences of confining electrons to one spatial di-\n\nmension is the prediction of spin-charge separation. That is, due to many-body\ninteractions the electron is no longer a stable quasiparticle, but decays into separate\nspin and charge modes [29\u201331]. A direct experimental observation of spin-charge separation has proven difficult although evidence for Luttinger liquid behavior has been\nreported in many 1D systems, via, e.g., a suppression of the density of states near\nthe Fermi level in ropes of carbon nanotubes [32] or power law behavior in the conductance vs. temperature in edge states of the fractional quantum Hall effect [33, 34]\nand carbon nanotubes [35]. Until now, very limited direct evidence for spin-charge\nseparation has been reported. Tunneling measurements later provided evidence for\nexplicit spin-charge separation in 1D systems, via real-space imaging of Friedel oscillations using scanning tunneling microscopy on single-walled carbon nanotubes [100]\nand momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling between two coupled QWRs [80], both\nof which observed multiple velocities indicative of spin-charge separation. More direct evidence of spin-charge separation would be to measure separate spin and charge\ndispersions in a single-particle spectral function. [36] Despite much effort in this area,\nthis has only been achieved recently in an unambiguous way in the Mott-Hubbard\ninsulator SrCuO2 . [36] Other claims of the detection of separately dispersing spin and\ncharge peaks with ARPES [95, 96] have been overturned [97, 98], or lack independent\nverification of the spin and charge energy scales. [99]\nPart of the difficulty in directly measuring spin and charge dispersions through\nmeasurements proportional to the single particle spectral function is that within Luttinger liquid theory, the spinon branch is muted compared to the holon branch.

Schematic diagram of peak broadening due to interactions and\nfinite temperature in the Luttinger liquid spectral function. The dashed\nlines denote the zero temperature dispersion tracking the charge part with\nvelocity v\u03c1 and the spin part with velocity v\u03c3 . At T 6= 0, the peaks become\nthermally broadened as indicated by the shaded regions. In this case the\neffective dispersion now tracks the solid red line, so that the low energy\npart tracks the sum of the two broad spin and charge peaks, resulting in\na low energy velocity vl which is between the spin and charge velocities.\nNote the high energy effective dispersion is parallel to the charge part\nbut displaced, an effect due to finite temperature and interactions. This\nresults in the high energy part extrapolating back to a value kex 6= kF .\n\ntemperature and experimental resolution only compound the problem, making direct\ndetection of the spinon branch in, e.g., ARPES difficult. In this chapter, we show how\nspin-charge separation can nevertheless be detected via the systematic temperature\ndependence of a kink in the effective electronic dispersion, even in cases where the\nspin peak is not directly resolvable.\n\n\f38\n5.2\n\nTheory\nAlthough the electron is not an elementary excitation of the Luttinger liquid be-\n\ncause it is unstable to spin-charge separation, an effective electronic dispersion may\nstill be defined by the existence of (generally broad) peaks in the spectral function.\nAt zero temperature in 1D, there are two sharp peaks in the electronic spectral function, one dispersing at the velocity v\u03c3 of the collective spin modes (spinons) and the\nother at the velocity v\u03c1 of the collective charge modes (holons) [38, 39]. However, at\nfinite temperature, the spin and charge peaks are broadened, as shown schematically\nin Fig. 5.1. At low binding energy, this causes the two to merge into one broad peak\nwith an effective dispersion which lies between the spin velocity v\u03c3 and the charge\nvelocity v\u03c1 . Although the two peaks separate at higher binding energies, interactions\nand temperature strongly suppress the spin peak for repulsive interactions. As a result, the dominant (and most easily measurable) peak will disperse with the charge\nvelocity at high energy. This gives rise to a kink in the effective electronic dispersion.\nSince the Luttinger liquid is quantum critical, the kink energy scales linearly with\ntemperature, Ekink \u221d a(r, \u03b3\u03c1 )T , where a is a function of the velocity ratio r = v\u03c3 /v\u03c1\n\nand the interaction strength \u03b3\u03c1 = 81 (K\u03c1 + K\u03c1\u22121 \u2212 2) where K\u03c1 is the charge Luttinger\n\nparameter. For \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15 \u2212 0.30 and r = 0.2 \u2212 0.4, the range of a is a = 3.3 \u2212 3.9.\nThe kink is stronger for lower values of r, but diminishes again for strong enough\ninteraction strength. Moreover, the high energy linear effective dispersion extrapolates to the Fermi energy at a wavevector kex 6= kF which is shifted from the Fermi\nwavevector by an amount which scales linearly with temperature. Recently explicit\nanalytic expressions for correlation functions in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at finite temperature were obtained under various conditions [37]. We consider here the\nsingle hole spectral function, A< (k, \u03c9), since it is directly proportional to the intensity\nobserved in ARPES experiments. In the spin-rotationally invariant case, the finite-\n\n\f39\ntemperature single hole spectral function [37] may be written in terms of the scaled\nvariables k\u0303 =\n\nvs k\n\u03c0T\n\nand \u03c9\u0303 =\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c0T\n\nwith the Boltzmann constant kB = 1,\n\nA< (k\u0303, \u03c9\u0303) \u221d\nh\u03b3c + 1\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\u0303\u2212k\u0303\n2\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndq h 1 (k\u0303 \u2212 2rq)\u00d7\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n+ (1 + r)q h\u03b3c\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03c9\u0303\u2212k\u0303\n2\n\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 r)q\n\n\u0015\n\n(5.1)\nwhere r = v\u03c3 /v\u03c1 is the ratio between the spin velocity and the charge velocity and h\u03b3\nis related to the beta function\n\u0014\n\nh\u03b3 (k) = Re (2i)\u03b3 B\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3 \u2212 ik\n,1\u2212 \u03b3\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe charge interaction strength \u03b3\u03c1 is related to the charge Luttinger parameter K\u03c1\nby \u03b3\u03c1 = 18 (K\u03c1 + K\u03c1\u22121 \u2212 2), i.e. \u03b3\u03c1 = 0 in the noninteracting case, and \u03b3\u03c1 increases with\nincreasing interaction strength. Because of spin rotation invariance, we use K\u03c3 = 1\nand \u03b3\u03c3 = 0.\n\n5.3\n\nResults and Discussion\nIn order to define a single-hole effective dispersion, we use momentum distribu-\n\ntion curves (MDC's), i.e. the single hole spectral function A< (k, \u03c9o) considered as a\nfunction of k at a given value of the frequency \u03c9o . The effective dispersion is identified by the position ko = ko (\u03c9o ) of the maximum of A<\nmax (k, \u03c9o ) with respect to k.\nThis gives an implicit equation for the effective single hole dispersion \u03c9o (ko ). This\nmethod gives a more reliable definition of the effective dispersion than using energy\ndistribution curves (EDC's), i.e. the spectral function considered as a function of frequency at a given momentum ko , A< (ko , \u03c9). Whereas EDC's can become quite broad\nwith increasing interaction strength, MDC's are always sharp due to kinematic constraints, [117] so that there is less experimental uncertainty in identifying the location\nof a peak in the MDC.\nFig. 5.2(a) shows representative intensity plots of the spectral function, A< (k, \u03c9).\nIn the figure, we have used an interaction strength \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15, temperature kB T =\n\n\f40\n\n(a) A< (k, \u03c9) at \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15\n\n0\nr=0.4\n-30\nr=0.2\n\n-60\n\nE, meV\n\nr=0.3\n\n-90\n\n-120\n-0.05\n\n-0.025\nk, \u00de-1\n\n0\n\n(b) Effective dispersion at \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15\n\nFigure 5.2. Intensity of the spectral function A< (k, \u03c9) and effective dispersions at an interaction strength \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15. (a) The intensity of A< (k, \u03c9) is\nshown for three different ratios of the spin to charge velocity, r = 0.2, 0.3,\nand 0.4. The black lines are the effective electronic dispersions derived\nfrom MDC peaks, as described in the text. The dashed line in the first\npanel shows that the high energy part of the effective dispersion does not\nextrapolate back to the Fermi wavevector, kF . (b) Comparison of the dispersions at different values of the velocity ratio, r = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. In\nall cases the spin velocity v\u03c3 = 1eV-\u00c5 and the temperature kB T = 14meV .\n\n14meV, and velocity ratios r = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. Fig 5.3 shows the corresponding\nMDC's for r = 0.2, plotted as a function of momentum k at a few representative\nenergies. The red triangles show the position of the maximum of the MDC curves.\nThe resulting effective dispersion is denoted by the solid black lines in Fig. 5.2(a).\n\n\f41\n\nFigure 5.3. MDC's for \u03b3\u03c1 = 0.15. The spin velocity v\u03c3 = 1eV-\u00c5 and\nthe temperature kB T = 14meV . The ratio of spin to charge velocity is\nr = 0.2.\n\nAs is evident from the figure, the effective dispersion is linear as expected at low\nenergy and also at high energy, but with different velocities. This gives rise to a\n\"kink\" in the effective dispersion, i.e. a change in the effective velocity. While at\nzero temperature, there are two well-defined peaks in the MDC's, one dispersing with\nthe charge velocity and the other with the spin velocity, when the temperature is\nfinite, the width of these MDC peaks is thermally broadened. (See Fig. 5.1.) At low\nenergies and finite temperatures, the sum of the two broad peaks is itself one broad\npeak, as can be seen in panels (a)-(c) in Fig. 5.3, and the maximum in the MDC will\ntrack a velocity vl which is between the spin and charge velocities, v\u03c3 < vl < v\u03c1 . At\nhigh enough energies, the temperature broadened singularities due to the spin and\ncharge part become sufficiently separated, and the spin peak is sufficiently muted,\nthat the MDC peak tracks the charge velocity. The separation of the muted spin\npeak from the stronger charge peak can be seen in panels (d) and (e) of Fig. 5.3.\n\n\f42\nIn panels (f)-(i), the charge and spin peaks have moved sufficiently apart that the\npeak in the MDC will track the charge part. Aside from the presence of a kink in\nthe effective dispersion, the position of the high energy linear effective dispersion is\nanother signature of Luttinger liquid behavior. In Fig. 5.2(a), the dotted line is an\nextrapolation of the high energy linear part of the effective dispersion back to the\nFermi energy. As can be seen from the figure, the dotted line extrapolates to E = EF\nat a wavevector kex = kF + \u03b1(r, \u03b3\u03c1 )T which is shifted from the Fermi wavevector by\nan amount which scales linearly with temperature.\nFig. 5.2(b) shows the effective dispersion for each of the three values of r, overlaid\nfor comparison. As one might expect, as r \u2192 1, the kink vanishes, since then the\ncharge and spin pieces disperse with the same velocity. As r is decreased, so that\nnow v\u03c1 > v\u03c3 , a kink appears, and strengthens as r is further decreased. One can\nsee the general features that the low energy part disperses with a velocity vl which\nis between the spin and charge velocities, v\u03c3 < vl < v\u03c1 , and that the high energy\npart disperses with the charge velocity. However, this high energy effective dispersion\nextrapolates back to the Fermi energy at a wavevector kex 6= kF . At higher interaction\nstrengths, EDC's broaden significantly, so that kex is smaller and the kink diminishes\nin strength. However, Ekink moves to deeper binding energy as the interaction strength\nis increased. Additional calculations exploring the dependence of the kink on various\ninteraction strengths are shown in appendix D.\nIn Fig. 5.4 we show how the effective dispersion changes with temperature. Because the Luttinger liquid is quantum critical, the spectral function has a scaling\nform, and the only energy scale in the effective dispersion is the temperature itself.\nAs a result, the kink energy depends linearly on the temperature, Ekink \u221d T . As\ncan be seen in the figure, varying only the temperature merely moves the kink to\ndeeper binding energy, leaving the low energy velocity vl (and therefore the strength\nof the kink) unchanged. in addition, as temperature is increased, the high energy\npart extrapolates back to the Fermi energy at a higher value of kex . Up until now, we\nhave studied the Luttinger kink in a phenomenological manner, allowing \u03b3\u03c1 and r to\n\n\f43\nvary independently of each other. It is also useful to consider the systematics of the\nkink strength and energy within the context of a microscopic model. As an example,\nwe show in Fig. 5.5 results for a Luttinger liquid derived from an incommensurate repulsive 1D Hubbard model. We take the density to be away from half filling, n = 0.3.\nFor a given value of U/t, renormalized values of \u03b3c\u2217 and r \u2217 are taken from Ref. [118],\nwhere Bethe-ansatz was used to find the renormalized values of K\u03c1\u2217 , v\u03c1\u2217 , and v\u03c3\u2217 . In\nFig. 5.5, we show the intensity plots of the spectral function along with the effective\ndispersion, for the values U/t = 16, 8, and 4 of the repulsive Hubbard model. This\ncorresponds to renormalized values of \u03b3\u03c1\u2217 = 0.05, 0.04, 0.02, and r \u2217 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, respectively. Upon increasing the Hubbard interaction strength U, the strength of the\nkink is enhanced due to the change in the renormalized velocity ratio r \u2217 .

The black lines are the effective\nelectronic dispersions derived from MDC peaks, as described in the text.\n(b) Comparison of the dispersions at different values of U/t. In all cases\nthe spin velocity v\u03c3 = 1eV-\u00c5 and the temperature kB T = 14meV .\n\nin this case, the kink is more pronounced, and there is a sharper distinction between\nthe low energy and high energy linear parts.\nIt is worth noting that behavior reminiscent of this physics was recently reported in\nARPES experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulator SrCuO2 .\n[36] Being an insulating material, SrCuO2 is gapped, whereas the Luttinger spectral\nfunctions presented here are not. Nevertheless, the effective dispersion (measured by\n\n\f45\nEDC's) shows a single peak at energies close to the gap, which then separates into\ntwo peaks at higher binding energy.\n\n5.4\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have shown the existence of a temperature-dependent kink in\n\nthe effective electronic dispersion of a spin-rotationally invariant Luttinger liquid, due\nto spin-charge separation. At low energies, the effective dispersion is linear, with a\nvelocity between the spin and charge velocities, v\u03c3 < vl < v\u03c1 . At high energies, the\nMDC peak disperses with the charge velocity. Because the Luttinger liquid is quantum critical, the kink between the high energy and low energy behavior has an energy\nset by temperature, Ekink \u221d T . In addition, the high energy effective dispersion extrapolates back to the Fermi energy at a wavevector kex 6= kF which is shifted from\nthe Fermi wavevector by an amount which is proportional to temperature. As interactions are increased, the kink diminishes in strength, and moves to higher binding\nenergy. In cases where finite temperature and interactions along with experimental\nuncertainties obscure the detection of two separate peaks in the effective dispersion,\nthe kink analysis presented here can be used as a signature of spin-charge separation\nin Luttinger liquids.\n\n\fLIST OF REFERENCES\n\n\f46\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n\n[1] L.D.Landau and E.M.Lifshitz.
