In the present work, we experimentally demonstrate that correlations in a four-qubit linear cluster\nstate cannot be described by local realism. This exploration is based on a recently derived Bell-type inequality [V. Scarani\net al., Phys. Rev A, 71 042325 (2005)] which is tailored, by using a combination of three- and four-particle correlations, to\nbe maximally violated by cluster states but not violated at all by GHZ states. We observe a cluster state Bell parameter of\n2.59 \u00b1 0.08, which is more than 7\u03c3 larger than the threshold of 2 imposed by local realism.\n\nMulti-particle entanglement is a complex, and relatively unexplored landscape. For two qubits, there exists\nonly one class of entanglement [1], for three qubits there\nare two classes of genuine three-particle entangled states\n[2, 3], and for four qubits at least nine different classes of\nentanglement have been identified [4]. Recently, a great\ndeal of attention has been devoted to a class of multiparticle entangled states called cluster states. This attention is largely due to the application of cluster states in\nRaussendorf and Briegel's \"one-way\" model for universal\nquantum computation [5]. In that model, one can drive a\nquantum computation entirely through single-qubit measurements and feedforward instead of unitary evolution.\nIn addition to being a practical alternative to the standard model for quantum computing, it has also called\ninto question the requirements for quantum computing\nand the relationship between measurement and dynamics [6]. One-way quantum computation based on cluster\nstates demonstrating one-qubit gates, two-qubit gates,\nand a quantum search algorithm was recently realized\nexperimentally [7].\n\nity [16, 17] is perhaps the best-known example. The inequality is constructed from two-qubit spin or, in our\ncase, polarization correlation functions. Similarly, the\nMermin inequality [18], testing local realism in threequbit entangled states, is made entirely of three-qubit\ncorrelations. Its generalization is based entirely on Nqubit correlations [19]. In general, the choice of these\ncorrelations determines the optimality of a Bell inequality, i.e. whether entanglement is detected by a maximal\nviolation of the inequality. For example, for the specific\ncase of three qubits the inclusion of lower-order correlations can lead to an optimal Bell inequality for a W\nstate, which could not detect GHZ entanglement [20].\nThis ambiguity and selectivity of which type of entangled state produces a maximal Bell violation makes the\nconnection between entanglement and Bell's inequality\ntenuous especially in multi-particle states [21] Nevertheless, it nicely highlights the fundamentally different\nways in which the GHZ and W states manifest violations\nof local realism. Since the number of distinct classes of\nentanglement grows rapidly with the number of qubits,\none might expect to find other Bell inequalities optimal\nfor different states. Specifically, for a Bell inequality optimal for cluster states, lower-order correlations will be\nof importance, since cluster states can be generated by\nnearest-neighbor Ising interaction [5].\n\nAside from their fascinating use for quantum computing, cluster states are a novel kind of multiparticle entangled states with fundamentally new and different properties. They share some properties with multi-particle\nextensions of both\u221aGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates |GHZi = 1/ \u221a2 (|000i123 + |111i123 ) [8, 9, 10] and\nW states |Wi = 1/ 3 (|100i123 + |010i123 + |001i123 )[2,\n11, 12]. Each single-qubit constituent of a cluster state\nis completely mixed, characteristic of GHZ states. Also,\nany two of the four cluster-qubits can be projected into\na Bell state by chosing an appropriate basis, similar to a\nGHZ state, but cluster states also share their persistency\nof entanglement [13] with the W states. Recent theoretical investigations of the \"nonlocality\" of these cluster\nstates have constructed new types of Bell inequalities and\neven GHZ-type arguments to refute local realism with the\nspecific correlations of cluster states in mind [14, 15].\n\nA recent theoretical work has found a GHZ-type argument for cluster states [14]. As in the original GHZ\narticle [8], the new work showed that there exists a combination of observables whose expectation values cannot\nbe consistent with a set of local realistic properties. However, in contrast to GHZ states, cluster states can even\nfulfill a GHZ argument using combinations of three- and\nfour-qubit correlations [22]. This leads to the development of a Bell-inequality that can be maximally violated\nby cluster states but cannot be violated at all by GHZ\nstates. In this experimental work, we use four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of photons\nto test that Bell inequality.\n\nBell's inequalities are specifically designed to put quantum physics to the test against local realistic models.\nFor two-qubit entangled states, the CHSH-Bell inequal-\n\nA linear cluster state arises when a line of qubits,\neach in the |+i state, where |\u00b1i = \u221a12 (|0i \u00b1 |1i), experi1\n\n\fsince the four terms in the Bell inequality are stabilizers\nof the cluster state, with the last term having opposite\nsign, the cluster state can violate this bound up to the\nalgebraic limit of this expression, i.e. SC = 4. It is a curious fact that the GHZ state, which is often said to be a\nmaximally-entangled multi-particle state, cannot violate\nthis inequality. Notice that the four properties for the\ncluster state include not only four-particle correlations\nas in the original GHZ argument, but also three-particle\ncorrelations. Those terms involving a measurement of\n\u03c3 0 of photon 1 completely ignore the state of polarization\nof that photon. Recall that in a GHZ state this tracing out of one of the qubits leaves the remaining state\ncompletely mixed with only classical correlations between\nqubits. This is not the case in the cluster state as its persistency of entanglement allows for some particles to be\nignored before all entanglement is lost. Thus different\nclasses of multiparticle entanglement can exhibit stronger\nviolations of local realism depending on the nature of the\ncorrelations in the Bell inequality.\nTo create the cluster state, we use a method first\ndemonstrated in reference [7]. For the experiment, we\ngenerate polarization-entangled photon pairs using typeII parametric down-conversion [24]. A UV-laser pulse\nwith a central wavelength of 395nm and a pulse duration\nof 200 fs makes two passes through a \u03b2-barium borate\n(BBO) crystal which emits entangled photons into the\nforward pair of modes a & b and into the backward pair\nof modes c & d (Figure 1). Transversal and longitudinal walk-off effects are erased by compensating crystals,\nwhich exist of a half wave plate (HWP) implementing a\n90\u25e6 rotation and an additional BBO crystal. These compensators are placed in each of the four modes. Final\nHWPs, one in mode a and another in mode c, and the\ntilt of the compensation crystal allows the generation of\nany of the four Bell states. The forward pair of modes\na & b are coherently superimposed with the backward\npair of modes c & d at the two polarizing beamsplitters\n(PBS) by adjusting the position of the delay mirror for\nthe UV-pump. The preparation of the cluster state relies\non all of the lowest-order processes which result in the\nsimultaneous emission of four photons.\nRecall that the PBS is a device which transmits horizontally polarized light and reflects vertically polarized\nlight. If two photons enter a PBS from opposite input ports, they will only emerge separately if their polarizations are the same in the H/V basis.\nIf twophotons enter a PBS from the same input port, they\nonly emerge separately if they are oppositely polarized\nin the H/V basis. In the present case, the source was\naligned to produce the Bell state \u03c6\u2212 into modes a &\nb and \u03c6+ into modes c & d.\nIf one pair of photons is emitted into modes a & b and another into c\n& d, then, after the two PBSs, the four-photon state\n|HHHHi1234 \u2212|V V V V i1234 is left, provided the photons\nemerge into four different output modes. Emission of\n\nence nearest-neighbour CPhase operations, i.e., |ji |ki \u2192\njk\n(\u22121) |ji |ki , j, k \u2208 {0, 1}[5]. Linear cluster states of\ntwo and three qubits are equivalent under local unitary\ntransformations, or \"locally-equivalent\", to Bell states\nand GHZ states, respectively [5]. In contrast, the fourqubit cluster is not locally equivalent to either the fourqubit GHZ or W states. In the present work, we use photon polarization to encode qubits with horizontal (vertical) polarization corresponding to |0i (|1i). Our target\ncluster state is of the form,\n|\u03c64 i =\n\n1\n(|HHHHi1234 + |HHV V i1234 +\n2\n|V V HHi1234 \u2212 |V V V V i1234 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the subscripts 1,2,3 and 4 label different photons in\nseparated spatial modes. This state is locally-equivalent,\nunder a Hadamard transformation H = \u221a12 (\u03c3 X + \u03c3 Z ) on\nthe first and last qubit, to the four-qubit linear cluster\nstate\n\u03c6\u20324\n\nwhere |\u00b1i =\n\n=\n\n1\n(|0 + 0+i1234 + |0 \u2212 1\u2212i1234 +\n2\n|1 \u2212 0+i1234 + |1 + 1\u2212i1234 ),\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(2)\n\n(|0i \u00b1 |1i) represents the complemen-\n\ntary linear polarization. The linear cluster state, \u03c6\u20324 ,\nhas a set of 15 nontrivial stabilizer operators, Si\u2032 , each\nmade up of products of four Pauli operators such that\nSi\u2032 \u03c6\u20324 = \u00b1 \u03c6\u20324 [14]. Since each of the Pauli operators,\n\u03c3 X , \u03c3 Y , \u03c3 Z ,and \u03c3 0 , has eigenvalues of \u00b11 (\u03c3 0 is the identity), each such stabilizer operators represent a property\nof the state that is fulfilled with certainty, i.e. an element of physical reality [23]. Following the reasoning of\nGHZ one can then find sets of 4 of these stabilizers, e.g.\n\u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Z , \u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y , \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 X \u03c3 Z , \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y with\nexpectation values +1, \u22121, +1, and +1, which are inconsistent with local realism. In addition, these stabilizers\ncan be used to construct a Bell inequality. Since \u03c6\u20324\nand |\u03c64 i are equivalent only up to local transformations,\nthe stabilizer operators required for the GHZ argument\nneed to be interconverted. Obviously, the GHZ argument\nand Bell inequality, remain intact. Making use of the relations H\u03c3 X = \u03c3 Z H, H\u03c3 Z = \u03c3 X H, H\u03c3 Y = \u2212\u03c3 Y H, and\nH\u03c3 0 = \u03c3 0 H, we can convert the four operators, Si\u2032 , to\na new set, Si , to \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X , \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y , \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 X \u03c3 X ,\nand \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y , where the expectation values for |\u03c64 i are\n+1, +1, +1, and \u22121, respectively. These stabilizers can\nnow be used to construct the Bell inequality optimized\nfor our cluster state |\u03c64 i . The Bell parameter, SC , is\ngiven by\nSC = |\u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X + \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y | +\n|\u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 X \u03c3 X \u2212 \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y |\n\n(3)\n\nThe assumptions of locality and realism put a limit on the\nstrength of the correlations such that SC \u2264 2. However,\n2\n\n\ftics. The threshold for a local realistic modeling of these\ncorrelations is SC \u2264 2, which our experiment violates by\n7\u03c3.\nThe remarkable entanglement properties of cluster\nstates can be readily used for the alternative \"one-way\"\nmodel of quantum computing [5], as was recently demonstrated experimentally [7]. Different from the two wellknown classes of multiparticle entanglement, GHZ and W\ntype, the properties of cluster states, such as their robustness against decoherence and their persistency of entanglement make them practical for experimental study and\ninteresting for quantum foundations. In this experiment,\nwe have addressed a question of more fundamental rather\nthan practical interest, namely how the novel family of\ncluster states can be used to demonstrate the non-local\nfacets of quantum physics. We investigated a new kind\nof Bell inequality based on a GHZ argument for cluster\nstates. The inequality detects cluster state entanglement\noptimally, while GHZ states would not violate the inequality. Our experimentally-produced cluster violates\nthe inequality by more than 7\u03c3. Our result demonstrates\nhow specifically tailored Bell inequalities (e.g. by using\nspecific correlations of the state) can become a useful tool\nto tackle the interesting questions between multiparticle\nentanglement and quantum nonlocality.\nThe authors thank V.

Provided\nthat all of these processes are indistinguishable and their\nrelative phases are fixed, the final state is a coherent superposition of all four terms. The requisite \u03c0-phase shift\non the \u2212 |HHV V i1234 term to + |HHV V i1234 was implemented using the HWP in mode a. A HWP rotation by an angle, \u03b8, modifies the amplitude of this term\naccording to the relation \u2212 cos 2\u03b8 |HHV V i1234 , thus a\nrotation of larger than 45\u25e6 adds the required phase shift.\nNote that this rotation also changes the amplitudes of\nthe |HHHHi1234 and |V V V V i1234 terms by a factor of\ncos \u03b8. Single-mode fibre-coupled photon counters were\nused in modes 1-4 to detect the photons. Controlling the\ncoincidence counting rates from the forward and backward pairs give the extra degrees of freedom to balance\nthe four amplitudes in the state.\nThe required expectation values, comprising products\nof Pauli operators, were reconstructed from sets of multiparticle polarization correlation measurements. Each\nof the 48 measurements was performed for 600s using\ncombinations of QWPs and linear polarizers in each of\nthe 4 output modes (1-4). The Pauli operators \u03c3 X,Y,Z\nwere measured by projective polarization measurements,\n|H/V i for the \u03c3 Z operator, |+/\u2212i = \u221a12 (|Hi \u00b1 |V i) for\nthe \u03c3 X operator, and |R/Li = \u221a12 (|Hi \u00b1 i |V i) for the\n\u03c3 Y operator. For the linear polarization measurements\nthe QWP was set parallel to the orientation of the polarizer, whereas for the circular polarization measurements,\nthe QWP was fixed to +45\u25e6 while the polarizer was\nhorizontally- or vertically- oriented. In order to extract\nthe expectation value, 16 (four-particle correlations) or 8\n(three-particle correlations) measurements are required.\nExperimental imperfections, including partial distinguishability in the four relevant four-photon emission\nprocesses and phase instabilities, lead to imperfect correlations which give some coincidence counts even when\ntheory predicts none. For the three-particle correlations, we removed the polarizer from mode 1. However, since the state preparation method was reliant upon\npost-selection, four-fold coincidences were still collected.\nThose measurements made without the polarizer show an\nincrease in the coincidence rate as well as an imbalance\nmost likely due to changes in the sensitive single-mode\nspatial filtering.\n\n[1] H.-K.Lo, S.

Experimental setup for the generation of four-photon cluster states. An ultraviolet laser pulse passes twice through a nonlinear\ncrystal which is aligned to produce polarization\nentangled photon pairs on both the first and second pass. Compensators (Comp) are placed in\nthe modes a, b, c, and d to compensate birefringent effects and half waveplates (HWP) in mode\na, c to manipulate the emitted entangled pairs.\nIn each output mode quarter waveplates (QWP)\nand polarizers (Pol) are placed to project onto\nany desired state. Including the possibility of\ndouble-pair emission and the action of the polarizing beam-splitters (PBS), the four components of the cluster state are prepared. The incorrect phase on the HHVV amplitude can easily\nbe changed by using the HWP in mode a. Using these processes and multiphoton coincidence\npost-selection, the four-photon cluster state |\u03c64 i\nis generated in modes 1-4.\nFigure 2 Experimentally extracted polarization correlations.\nThe cluster-state Bell inequality requires four different polarization correlations.\nThese are extracted from a complete set of 48 four-fold coincidence measurements. The four-photon correlations, \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y\nand \u03c3 X \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y \u03c3 X, are combinations of 16 coincidence rates, whereas the three-photon correlations, \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 X \u03c3 X and \u03c3 0 \u03c3 Z \u03c3 Y \u03c3 Y , are combinations of 8 coincidence rates.\nEach measurement run was recorded for 600s.\nA quarterwave plate and linear polarizer were used for\neach polarization projection.
