That was the\nquestion [1] which was discussed for developed capital markets. Those capital\nmarkets have their properties, which are studied and understood to quite a large\nextension [2]. There exist algorithmic prescriptions, called automated trading\nsystems, for trading on these markets. It means that there exist algorithmic\nprescriptions generating buy and sell signals. These algorithmic prescriptions\nare unambiguously defined rules based on fundamental and technical analysis.\nThey are taking into account investment characteristics of an investor. While\ndevelopment in prices in future is different from that in history, reaction of\nbuyers and sellers on period of similar development on the market is similar. To\ndefine these algorithmic prescriptions for the nearest period it is necessary to\ntest and to optimize these algorithmic prescriptions on recent historical data.\nFrom similarity of reaction of buyers and sellers on similar situations we obtain\nfor using these algorithmic prescriptions with tested and optimized parameters\nconsistency. They are robust. In longer periods it is necessary to combine these\nalgorithmic prescriptions with reoptimalisation of them, using for example a\nmethod of shifting window. Main methods of using automated trading systems\nare as analysis of development on the capital market and as an investment\nstrategy, where buyers and sellers are acting after every buy or sell signal.\nThis paper has the following sections: Automated Trading Systems, Etalon\n- Developed Capital Market, Emerging Capital Markets, Automated Trading\nSystems and Emerging Capital Markets, and Summary. We studied here automated trading systems on developed and emerging capital markets. Main results\nare the following ones. The standard for developed markets automated trading\nsystem with 40-days simple moving average was used for the index SIX Industrial from the emerging slovak capital market. It was tested for 1000 and 730\ntrading days. It is not an optimal trading system for the emerging market due\nto the fact that the Buy and Hold trading system was 7.80 times more profitable\nthan this etalon trading system for active trading. Simple taking of profitable\nstandard trading system from a developed capital market thus does not lead\nto optimal results on the emerging capital markets. We then studied optimized\nstandard trading system based on the simple moving average. The parameter of\noptimization was the number of weeks in the moving average. We took the range\nfrom 1 to 100 weeks. An optimal system was that with 5 weeks. This trading\nsystem then has some of its characteristics comparable with the etalon trading\nsystem 40-days simple moving average trading on the NYSE Composite Index.\nThe emerging market is more risky than the developed market. The profit on\nthe emerging market is also higher. The range of optimized system parameter\nis quite robust. Observed was increase of number of trades in the range of the\n21 weeks to the 25 weeks. This indicates creation of new optimal middle range\ntrading system. Results of testing for liquid shares are quantitatively similar to\nthe results of testing for the SIX 30 Industrial index.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nAutomated Trading Systems\n\nAdvantages of automated trading systems are, [2], in automated decision process, in discipline, in higher consistency of results with elimination of emotions,\nautomated elimination of loss to lower levels and automated using of every profitable trend, and in finding every important trend. Disadvantages are that no\nsystem is working universally good for every conditions on the market, as the\nmarket develops its characteristics are changing and thus we should not relay on\nhistorical data only. It may happen that buy and sell signals may not be realized\ndue to some other reasons (low liquidity, broker inability to realize the trade,\nrealization of the trade at a price completely different from that signaled by the\ntrading system, and other random events which may lead to the situation in\nwhich buy and sell signals cannot be realized). There are complementary methods to lower disadvantages of the trading system, they are based on the following\nof and analyzing of several automated trading systems and indicators simultaneously (almost all of these trading systems should give the same trading signal\nand none of them should give an opposite signal), new algorithms are looking\nfor and tested (artificial intelligence, etc.). To use automated trading systems\nit is necessary to satisfy conditions like liquidity of the market with securities,\nlarge set of historical data as concerning price (at least 5 years for middle period\nrange of trading or to have at least 30 generated trades during the period which\nhistorical data cover) [3]. Normality of distribution of returns [4] on emerging\nand developed markets should be verified. A user of the automated trading\nsystems should have defined its characteristics like investment horizon, whether\nhe/she is an aggressive or conservative investor. It is necessary to know rate\nof returns for investment of free (not invested on the capital market) finances\nto banks, and to be able to reinvest to the same securities. Effective commission fees should be known. Stop-loss characteristics for an investment should\nbe known. An investor should has enough reserve funds to survive the worst\nsituations on the market. The automated trading system should be defined\nunambiguously and should be simple. Defining the algorithm of the trading\nsystem one should preserve basic principles of financial modeling, [5]. There\nis a principle of independence, a principle of minimization of constrains and a\nprinciple of top-down approach.\nAutomated trading systems should be compared with etalons of automated\ntrading systems. It is necessary to compare risk and performance of these systems. System based on passive strategy Buy and Hold (BH) is one etalon. Another etalon on developed capital markets is automated trading system based\non 40-days moving average indicator. There are such criteria of risk for a given\ntrading system like the longest and the deepest fall of the price in an open position (this is connected with reserve funds), number of trades (commission fees),\nnumber of win trades (small number of win trades with large profit does not\nmean that such a system would be consistent in the future).\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nEtalon - Developed Capital Market\n\nAs an etalon for a developed capital market we will use standard passive reference automated system Buy and Hold. Standard active etalon automatic\ntrading system for developed capital market is 40-days simple moving average\nsystem, [2]. We used 19-years (January 1977 - December 1996) period for index\nNYSE Composite. For 40-days simple moving average automated trading system we obtained profit 94.44 for this period. The etalon Buy and Hold system\ngives us for the same period only 85.01 points. Number of trades for 40-days\nsimple moving average automated trading system was 57. It means 3.20 trades\nper year. 35 percents were profitable. The largest loss in points was 10.60\npercents from the level 145.32 of the index in the year 1986. The largest loss\nin percents was 22.53 percents from the level 60.24. The index of risk for this\nautomated trading system defined as the ratio of total profit to the largest loss\nhas the value 6.13.\n\n4\n\nEmerging Capital Markets\n\nAn efficient capital market is that market in which every security price equals to\nits investment value (NPV - Net Present Value) at all times. Presence of the (log) normality distribution of returns on effective markets most of the time is that\npoint which forms a base for analyzing returns on diversified portfolios when the\nholding period is relatively short. The only correct measures of returns and risk\nare mean return per a given period and the standard deviation. It is an empirical\nevidence that the (log-) normal distribution of returns is not present all the time\nwith the same parameters on efficient markets (trends are changing), and it is\nnot true that such a distribution of returns is present on efficient markets as\nsuch for given every time periods. The aim of many econophysical models is\nto explain both phenomena. However simple tests of presence of normality of\ndistribution of returns on efficient capital markets should be done first. It is not\nknown whether an emerging capital market is or it is not an efficient market\nin the sense in which every security price equals its investment value at all\ntimes. In the case of the emerging capital market testing of the presence of\nthe (log-) normal distribution is even more important than in the case of the\nefficient capital market. It is necessary to find the answer to the questions:\nwhat are the correct measures of mean returns and risk on emerging markets?\nRecently we tested normality of distribution of returns on the slovak capital\nmarket, which is an emerging capital market, within the period of years 1993\n(the starting year of capital market trading) - 1996. We studied presence [4] of\nnormally distributed returns on the slovak capital market from the short time\npoint of view as concerning main capital market indexes, industrial indexes, and\nfor shares. We used a simple sign-test which was appropriately modified. As an\netalon we considered the capital market of the U.S.A. We have found that main\n\n5\n\n\findexes of the slovak capital market (SAX, SEVIS 100, RMS F, RMS I, SIX\nALL, SIX 50, SIX 30 Industrial) and indexes of industries on the same market,\nas well as those shares with the highest market capitalization, have comparable\nvalues of the index measuring presence of normality of distribution with those\nvalues of this index for the etalon market. On the emerging market we have\nfound an industrial structure as concerning presence of the normality of returns.\nWith increasing time and liquidity of shares on the emerging market the presence\nof the normality of returns increases. From our results it follows that the risk\nmay be described by the standard deviation of returns for main indexes of the\nslovak capital market and for some of industrial indexes of the same market, as\nwell as for those shares which have the highest market capitalization.\n\n5\n\nAutomated Trading Systems and Emerging\nCapital Markets\n\nAs an emerging capital market we used the slovak capital market. We tested\nthis market. Our aim was to find its characteristics for analysis, and for trading\n(where however number of trading days is smaller for the emerging market with\nrespect to the period of 19 years of the etalon above). We used for testing\nof automated trading systems the methodology from [3]. As an market index\nwe used the index SIX 30 Industrial. Further we tested a set of liquid shares\nfrom shares traded on Bratislava Stock Exchange (where in the period which\nwe studied 777 different share titles were traded) and a set of liquid shares from\nthe RMS Slovakia over the counter market (where in the period studied 639\ndifferent share titles were traded). We used two time periods for the index and\nshares from the Bratislava Stock Exchange (1000 and 730 trading days) and\none time period for shares traded on the RMS Slovakia (730 trading days, there\nwere not 1000 trading days on this market). We used data from the beginning\nof trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange in 1993. End of the time period is\non 31st August 1996. The time period 730 trading days does not contain data\nfrom the beginning of trading until the spring of 1994. We considered Long\npositions traded on the closing price last value in a given week for shares and\non the last value of the index for a given week in trades only. Thus trading\nwas on the Closing price for shares and on the value of the index. Number of\nweeks which we used to wait to confirm the signal buy or the signal sell was 0\nweeks. Thus we traded aggressively. We considered zero commission fees. We\nassumed that there existed possibility to reinvest all of the investment again\ninto the same share title or index.\nMain results which we obtained were the following. For the standard automated trading system with 40-days simple moving average for the index SIX\nIndustrial (1000 trading days) we have found rate of return (per annum) 3.68\npercents. There were 4 trades, one of them was profitable. The largest loss\n\n6\n\n\fwas 71.87 points. The ratio of total profit to the largest loss is 1.43 . The Buy\nand Hold trading system was 7.80 times more profitable. Thus we can see that\nsimple procedure of taking profitable standard trading system from a developed\ncapital market and to use it on an emerging capital market does not lead to\noptimal results on the emerging capital market. Or even it does not lead to acceptable results on this market, see number of trades and number of win trades\nwhich is very low.\nWe then optimized this standard trading system based on the simple moving\naverage. The parameter of optimization was the number of weeks. We took the\nrange from 1 to 100 weeks for the SIX 30 Industrial (1000 trading days trading\nperiod). An optimal system was that with 5 weeks. It is 25 trading days. The\nrate of return (per annum) was 89.59 percents. Number of trades was 13. There\nwere 4 win trades, e.i. 30.08 percents of trades. This number is comparable with\nthe etalon, the NYSE Composite Index. Number of trades per year is 3.71 .\nThis number is also comparable with the NYSE Composite etalon. The largest\nloss was 120.30 points. The ratio of the total profit to the largest loss is 20.63,\nwhich is better than on the etalon market. The emerging market is however\nmore risky than the developed market. The Buy and Hold trading system was\n0.32 times less profitable. As the optimal range for active trading using trading\nsystem based on the simple moving average we have found range from 3 to 7\nweeks. This range is quite robust. We have also observed increase of number of\ntrades in the range of the 21 weeks to the 25 weeks using trading system based\non the simple moving average. This increase indicates creation of a new optimal\nmiddle range trading system. Testing the same system on the same index for\n730 trading days we obtained quantitatively similar characteristics as for 1000\ntrading days period. Results for liquid shares are also similar quantitatively.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we discussed basic automated trading systems for developed and\nemerging capital markets. Can active management of a portfolio of securities\nadd value? That question [1] was discussed for developed capital markets. Active management of portfolio uses usually automated trading systems. They\nare algorithmic prescriptions generating buy and sell signals which may add\nvalue. These rules are taking into account investment characteristics of an investor. We used an empirical fact known from developed capital markets that\nwhile development in prices in future is different from that in history, reaction\nof buyers and sellers on period of similar development on the market is similar.\nThus it has sense to define these algorithmic prescriptions for the nearest period on the market by testing and optimizing these algorithmic prescriptions on\nrecent historical data. From similarity of reaction of buyers and sellers on similar situations we obtain prescriptions with parameters which are consistent and\nrobust. In longer periods these algorithmic prescriptions are reoptimized, using\n7\n\n\fthe method of shifting window. Automated trading systems are used mainly to\nanalyze development on the capital market and as an investment strategy, where\nbuyers and sellers are acting after every buy or sell signal. In section Automated\nTrading Systems we discussed advantages and disadvantages of these systems.\nAutomated trading systems may be used when conditions like liquidity of the\nmarket with securities and large set of historical data as concerning price are\nfulfilled. Normality of distribution of returns on developed capital markets is\nusually present. However it should be verified. It is known that this distribution\nis only roughly describing distribution of returns, see for example [6]. We discuss\nproperties of developed capital markets as well as of emerging capital markets.\nThe empirical analysis of developed capital markets lead to description of distribution of return on these markets by Truncated Lvy Flight distributions. It is\nnot known whether this distribution is present on emerging capital markets and\nit is difficult to verify presence of this distribution on emerging capital markets\ndue to their specific properties. We used properties of normal distribution of\nreturns which is most of the time present on the developed and in some time\nperiods on emerging capital markets, as we verified this fact. A user of the\nautomated trading systems has its characteristics like investment horizon and\nwhether he/she is an aggressive or conservative investor. In test we are using\nin general rate of returns for investment of free (not invested on the capital\nmarket) finances into banks. It is assumed that there is present possibility to\nreinvest return into the same securities. Effective commission fees should be\nknown. We used in our tests zero commission fees. We did not used stop-loss\ncharacteristics for trading systems because the standard 40-days moving average\nmethod on developed capital markets does not use them. It is assumed that an\ninvestor has enough reserve funds to survive the worst situations on the market.\nAutomated trading system tested in our paper was compared with the etalon\nof automated trading systems, with Buy and Hold system. Another etalon on\ndeveloped capital markets is automated trading system based on 40-days moving average indicator mentioned above. We tested this etalon for a developed\ncapital market and for an emerging capital market. We have found that on the\nemerging capital market this etalon is not a good etalon. The parameter of\n40 days should be changed. Criteria of risk for a given trading system like the\nlongest and the deepest fall of the price in an open position, number of trades\nand number of win trades may be used on emerging capital markets. We used\n19-years (January 1977 - December 1996) period for the NYSE Composite Index. For 40-days simple moving average automated trading system we obtained\nprofit 94.44. The etalon Buy and Hold system gives us for the same period only\n85.01 points. Thus active trading on developed capital market gives a value.\nNumber of trades for 40-days simple moving average automated trading system\nwas 57 during all the period. Thus 3.20 trades per year were found. 35 percents\nof the trades were profitable. The largest loss was 10.60 percents from the level\n145.32 of the index in the year 1986. The largest loss in percents was 22.53\npercents from the level 60.24. For this automated trading system we have found\n8\n\n\fthe ratio of total profit to the largest loss with the value 6.13.\nOn the efficient capital market every security price equals to its investment\nvalue (NPV) almost all the time. This is not true on emerging capital markets.\nTests of presence of the (log-) normal distribution of returns on effective markets\nand on emerging markets show that these markets are different. On developed\ncapital markets most of the time this presence is a base for analyzing returns\non diversified portfolios when the holding period is relatively short (CAPM and\nsimilar models). Then the only correct measures of returns and risk are mean\nreturn per a given period and the standard deviation of returns. It is an empirical evidence that the (log-) normal distribution of returns on developed capital\nmarkets is not present (with 95 percent probability for a given time period,\nor with a similar probability) all the time. Trends are changing on developed\ncapital markets and thus the same parameters of the normal distribution of returns on efficient markets cannot be used for longer time periods and moreover\nit is not true that such as a distribution of returns ((log-) normal)is present\non efficient markets as such for given time periods. Simple tests of presence of\nnormality of distribution of returns on efficient capital markets should be thus\ndone first also. Many of indicators in technical analysis and many models in\nfundamental analysis are using the fact of presence of this distribution on developed capital markets (in practical sense). On emerging capital markets security\nprice does not equal to its investment value (NPV) at time periods which are\nmuch more frequent than those for the developed capital market. In the case\nof the emerging capital market testing of the presence of the (log-) normal distribution of returns is necessary for the same reasons as for developed capital\nmarket. Moreover it is necessary to find the answer to such questions like what\nare the correct measures of mean returns and risk on emerging markets? Tests\nof presence of normal distribution of returns on the emerging slovak capital\nmarket within the period of years 1993 (starting year of capital market trading)\nto 1996 were performed in this paper. In this period the market was certainly\nan emerging market, thus we do not study latter years on this market in which\nit is approaching developed market properties more. Results of our tests of\npresence of normally distributed returns, from the short time point of view, as\nconcerning main capital market indexes, industrial indexes, and for shares for\nslovak capital market using a simple sign-test of hypothesis of presence of this\ndistribution with 95 percent probability which was appropriately modified have\nshown that main indexes of the slovak capital market (SAX, SEVIS 100, RMS\nF, RMS I, SIX ALL SIX 50, SIX 30 Industrial), and indexes of industries of\nthe same market, as well as those shares with the highest market capitalization,\nare reaching comparable values of the index measuring presence of normality\nwith those values of this index for the etalon market (NYSE in USA). With\nincreasing time and liquidity of shares on the emerging market the presence\nof the normality of returns increases. From our results it follows that the risk\nmay be described by the standard deviation of returns for main indexes of the\nslovak capital market and for some of indexes for industries of the same market,\n9\n\n\fas well as for those shares which have the highest market capitalization. We\ndid not tested presence of the TLF distribution for the slovak capital market.\nThus the question whether an active management of a portfolio of securities can\nadd value may be extended to emerging capital markets. This was done in this\npaper. As an emerging capital market we used the slovak capital market, as it\nwas mentioned. For testing we used the methodology used for testing developed\ncapital markets, [3]. We used the index SIX 30 Industrial as an market index.\nWe tested also a set of liquid shares from shares traded on Bratislava Stock\nExchange and a set of liquid shares from the RMS Slovakia over the counter\nmarket. Two time periods for the index and shares from the Bratislava Stock\nExchange (1000 and 730 trading days) and one time period for shares traded\non the RMS Slovakia market (730 trading days) were studied. Data from the\nbeginning of trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange in 1993 were used. The\ntime period 730 trading days does not contain data from the beginning of trading until the spring of 1994. Thus we eliminated trading days at the beginning\nof trading on the market when prices on the market were developing from those\nresulted from the coupon privatization to those resulting from trading on the\nemerging capital market. We considered Long positions in trades on the last\nClose price value in a given week for shares and on the last value of the index\nfor a given week in trades only. Short position trading is forbidden on slovak\ncapital market. Trading using software was done on the Closing price for shares\nand on the value of the index. We traded as aggressive investors, number of\nweeks which we used to wait to confirm the signal buy or the signal sell was 0\nweeks. This corresponds to the etalon for active trading systems on developed\ncapital markets which is 40-days simple moving average trading system. Zero\ncommission fees were considered. It was assumed that there existed possibility\nto reinvest all of the investment returns from a given period (from the period\nwith open Long position) again into the same share title or index. In its simplest\nform we did not gave money into bank when Long position was closed. This\nsimplification also correspond to the mentioned etalon.\nThe standard etalon automated trading system with 40-days simple moving\naverage on the index SIX Industrial (1000 trading days) lead to the rate of\nreturn (per annum) 3.68 percents. There were 4 trades, only one of them was\nprofitable. The largest loss was 71.87 points. The ratio of total profit to the\nlargest loss is 1.43 . The Buy and Hold trading system was 7.80 times more\nprofitable. The passive trading is more profitable than the active trading using\nthe standard etalon automated trading system from developed capital markets.\nWe see that it is not possible simply to take standard trading system etalon\nfrom a developed capital markets and to use it for emerging capital markets. It\ndoes not lead to optimal results on the emerging capital market. It leads even\nto such unacceptable results on this market as low number of trades and low\nnumber of win trades.\nWe then optimized this standard trading system. The parameter of optimization was the number of weeks in the simple moving average. We took the\n10\n\n\frange from 1 week to 100 weeks for the parameter for the SIX 30 Industrial\nindex with 1000 trading days trading period. An optimal system was that with\n5 weeks which corresponds to 25 trading days. The rate of return (per annum)\nwas 89.59 percents for this optimized trading system for this period. This is\nlarger than the rate of returns using Buy and Hold trading system. Number\nof trades was 13. There were 4 win trades, e.i. 30.08 percents of trades. This\nnumber is comparable with the etalon for active trading on the developed market on the NYSE Composite Index. Number of trades per year is 3.71 . Again\nthis number is also comparable with the NYSE Composite etalon. The largest\nloss was 120.30 points. The ratio of the total profit to the largest loss is 20.63,\nwhich is larger than that for trading using the etalon for developed market and\ntrading with this etalon system on the SIX 30 Industrial. The ratio is larger\nthan that on the developed market. The emerging market is more risky than the\ndeveloped market which corresponds to higher rate of returns on the emerging\nmarket than on the developed market. The Buy and Hold trading system was\n0.32 times less profitable than the trading using the optimized trading system.\nThe optimal range of the parameter for active trading using trading system\nbased on the optimized simple moving average is that range for which the results are near the results for the optimized system. We have found that the\noptimal range of the parameter is from 3 to 7 weeks with maximum for 5 weeks.\nThis range is quite robust around the optimal range of 5 weeks. As we so above\nthe 40-days simple moving average trading systems is unacceptable in this case.\nObserved increase of the number of trades in the range of 21 weeks to 25\nweeks using trading system based on simple moving average indicates creation\nof a new optimal for middle range trading system. The same system tested on\nthe same index for 730 trading days gave quantitatively similar characteristics\nas for 1000 trading days period. Thus characteristics of the emerging market\nwere similar whether we took into account the period of beginning of trading\nor not. Results of testing for liquid shares are also quantitatively similar to the\nresults of testing optimized trading system on the index SIX 30 Industrial. This\nindex contains in its portfolio liquid shares, so the observed similarity is not\nsurprising. Automated trading systems known from developed capital markets\ndo not have the same properties on emerging capital markets. It is necessary\nfor emerging capital markets to test these systems again.\n\nAcknowledgements\nPart of the results presented here was preliminary presented in the authors talk\ngiven in slovak on the seminar Infofinex 1997 in Banska Bystrica.
