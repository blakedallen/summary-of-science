Introduction\nThe appearance of the bulk motif in small sized aluminum clusters has excited many\nresearchers. As a consequence of this property, Al clusters are attracting a lot of attention for their\npotential applications in optics, medicines,2 microelectronics3 and nanocatalysis4. In addition to the\nappearance of bulk motif, ground state Aln clusters (n < 100) show size specific features in their\nstructures,5-8 cohesive energies,9-11 and thermodynamic properties.12\u201314 For example, the ground state\ngeometries of many clusters are seen to change from a disordered morphology to an ordered one (or\nvice-versa) with the addition of a single atom.15 Adding an extra atom to some clusters also changes the\nmelting transition from a first-order to a second order.16-22 The above mentioned and many other size\ndependent characteristics make the study and application of aluminum nano clusters with up to a few\nhundred atoms both interesting and challenging.\nOne such application is the synthesis of aluminum nitride. Aluminum nitride, one of the\nindustrially important materials, carries high impact as an electronic material and is usually synthesized\nthrough a direct reaction between Al surface or clusters and N2 at a high temperature and pressure23.\nNevertheless, one needs to modify a processing condition to smoothen such tedious and hard reactions.\nConsequently, recent experimental studies showing that Al clusters of range 25-100 have melting\ntemperatures that are 450 K, well below the bulk melting temperature, 934 K has excited the several\nresearchers22. Not only clusters in this range show a depressed melting temperature, they also show a\nsize sensitive melting behavior. These results can be exploited to design the chemical reactions at\ndesired temperature by choosing an appropriate cluster. In addition, the depressed melting temperature\nof clusters facilitates easier chemisorption and thus various chemical reactions at very low temperatures\n(around 450 K). It is noteworthy that N2 molecule is only known to physisorb on the Al surfaces below\nthe melting temperatures24 and thus use of clusters for such reactions could be more advantageous.\nThe above aspect is demonstrated very nicely in a recent report by Jarrold and co-workers1\nwhere they discuss the reactivity of N2 on Al100 cluster. They have determined the melting temperature\n\n\fof Al100\n\n3\nusing heat capacity measurements following which the ion beam experiments are used to\n\ninvestigate the reaction between the cluster and molecular N2. They show that above the melting\ntransition, the activation barrier for N2 adsorption decreases nearly by 1 eV. The importance of Al-N\nreaction has also motivated Romanowski et. al.25 to perform a theoretical study of N2 reaction with\nliquid Al metal. They have determined the activation barrier for dissociative chemisorption of N2 to be\n3.0 eV. They propose that the melting decreases the surface energy, and atoms in liquid are mobile and\nbetter able to adjust the N2 molecule. Hence, previous studies on N2 adsorption conclude that the atoms\non the surface of the liquid cluster move to minimize their energy lowering the activation barrier.\nApart from the enhanced mobility, very little understanding is available concerning the role of\nstructure and bonding of Al clusters on the adsorption/reactivity of the cluster. The catalytic reactivity\nis always attributed to specific and precise structural rearrangement of atoms in the material. It is\nworthwhile to correlate the above two parameters to their reactivity. Thus, the interesting questions are:\n\"Is the chemisorption of N2 molecule a consequence of highly different structure of Al cluster\nfollowing the phase transition? Do the changes in structure modify the chemical bonding property\nwithin the cluster thereby enhancing its reactivity or the higher reactivity is due the dynamical\nrearrangement of atoms within cluster? Does this reactivity vary as a function of cluster size?\" To\nanswer the above questions, we have studied systematically the adsorption behavior of N2 on Al cluster\nas a function of cluster size. We also address the issue of conformational changes following the phase\ntransition and their impact on N2 adsorption.\nTo achieve this objective, we choose a series of Al clusters of variable size. It includes low\nenergy conformers of Al2, Al3, Al13, Al30 and Al100 clusters. Al2 and Al3 are the smallest of Al clusters\nthat have been analyzed for understanding the adsorption of N2 molecule. The reason for starting with\nsuch small clusters is to have a qualitative understanding on two issues viz., (a) to understand the\nelectronic properties underlying the adsorption of the molecule on the cluster. (b) to analyze the\nadsorption of N2 molecule as a function of Al cluster size. After analyzing the various reactive sites of\n\n\f4\nthese clusters, N2 is adsorbed on them to study its interactive nature. The zero-temperature studies of\nadsorption is extended to a decahedron conformer as well as a few high energy conformers of Al13\n(typically seen after the phase transition) to analyze the ease of adsorption on high energy\nconformations. Since melting enhances distortion, these high energy structures help us to correlate the\nspecific role of structure and bonding towards chemisorption of N2. All considered structures were\noptimized and the bonding properties within them are analyzed through Electron Localization Function\n(ELF) and Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO).\nThe rest of the work is organized as follows. In Section II, we give a brief description of the\ncomputational method and descriptors of reactivity used in this work. Results and discussion are\npresented in section III for Aln--N2 interaction. Finally, our conclusions are summarized in section IV.\nII. Computational Details\nAs mentioned, we have considered aluminum clusters of varying sizes viz.,: Al2, Al3, Al13, Al30\nand Al100 for the study. All the possible conformations of these clusters are optimized. Following the\noptimization, low lying structures are considered for further study of adsorption. All the structures were\noptimized using Density Functional Theory (DFT) based method. The optimization is carried out using\nVASP.26, 27 As in standard DFT programs, the stationary ground state is calculated by solving iterative\nKohn-Sham equations.28 We use Vanderbilt's ultra-soft pseudo-potentials29 within the Local Density\nApproximation (LDA) for describing the behavior of core electrons. An energy cut-off of 400 eV is\nused for the plane wave30 expansion of Al and N atoms. The structural optimization of all geometries is\ncarried out using the conjugate gradient method,31 except for the high energy conformers where, we use\nquasi-Newton method32 in order to retain the local minima. The structure is considered to be optimized\nwhen the maximum force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV/\u00c5. Similar optimization procedures are\nrepeated for the interaction of N2 molecule at all Al cluster reactive sites, and for that of bare N2\nmolecule. All the molecules are enclosed in cubical box of 25 \u00c5 dimensions.\nVarious descriptors are used to analyze the reactivity of the Al clusters. One such is Electron\n\n\f5\nLocalization Function (ELF) modified and applied by Silvi and Savin. According to this description,\n33\n\nthe molecular space is partitioned into regions or basins of localized electron pairs or attractors. At very\nlow value of ELF all the basins are connected. As this value increases, the basins begin to split and\nfinally, we will get as many basins as the number of atoms. Typically, the existence of an iso-surface in\nthe bonding region between two atoms at a high value of ELF say >0.70, signifies localized bond in\nthat region. The mathematical description of ELF is as follows,\n\n\u03b7 (r ) =\n1+ (\n\n1\nDp\nDh\n\n)2\n\n5\n5\n3\nDh = ( )(3\u03c0 2 ) 3 * \u03c1 3\n10\n\nDp =\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\n1\n1\n| \u2207\u03c8 |2 \u2212 | \u2207\u03c1 |2\n\u2211\n2 i\n8\n\n\u03c1\nN\n\n2\n\n\u03c1 = \u2211 |\u03c8 (r ) |\ni =1\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the sum in Eqn. 2.4 is over all the occupied orbitals. Dh is the kinetic energy of the electron gas\nhaving the same density or one can say its the value of Dp in a homogeneous electron gas and \u03c1 is the\ncharge density.\nWe have analyzed the ELF for all clusters and their complexes of N2 at isovalue where atomic\nbasins start merging. Thus, as size and geometry of Al cluster changes, here, the ELF analysis helps us\nto understand the discrete bonding pattern. In addition, we also analyze the partial charge densities of\nFMO. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital\n(LUMO) are the best used global descriptors of reactivity.34-36a The N2 adsorption at particular site is\nfollowed by HOMO and LUMO analysis, which helps to distinguish the most reactive site.\nSubsequently, after complex formation, same descriptors elaborate the peculiar Al-N bonding. In\n\n\f6\naddition, to understand the over all charge distribution after complex formation, the charges on\n\nvarious atoms (in optimized bare clusters and respective complexes) are calculated through the\nGAMESS36b considering the single point energy convergence.\nFollowing the studies on the ground state conformations of Al clusters of varying sizes, as\nmentioned, we have considered few high energy conformations of Al13 for N2 adsorption. This is done\nwith an aim of elucidating the role of electronic properties of these high energy melted conformations\non the chemisorption. One of the earlier theoretical works has reported that Al13 undergoes a solid to\nliquid transition between 1000-1700 K37. Hence, the high energy conformations are obtained from a\nfinite temperature run of Al13 at 1200 and 1600K. It may be recalled that an earlier work37 predicted\n1600K to be nearly melting temperature of the cluster. The finite temperature calculations are\nperformed by using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics based on the Kohn-Sham formulation of\nDFT, employed in VASP. The ionic phase space of the cluster is sampled classically in a canonical\nensemble using a method proposed by N\u00f3se38. Pursuing the simulation of 10 pico seconds, few\nconformations were chosen from these high temperature runs. The structure, bonding and reactivity of\nthese clusters are discussed and compared with those of the low lying conformation of the same cluster.\nIII. Results and Discussion:\n(a) Ground State Geometries of Al clusters and their Interaction with N2:\n(i) Structure, Bonding of Al2 and its Interaction with N2 molecule:\n\nAl2 like any mono atomic dimer cluster is a covalently bonded one,39-43 while Al3 is a widely\nstudied system for adsorption of various molecules such as H244-46, O247 etc. Figure 1 gives the ground\nstate geometries of Al2 and their complexes with N2. The ELF contours and the frontier orbitals for\nthese systems are given in the same Figure. Various inter atomic distances along with the Mulliken\ncharges on each atom [in square bracket] for Al2 and Al2--N2 are given in the same Figure.\nWe begin with a discussion of Al2 followed by its complex with N2. The inter atomic bond\ndistance in Al2 is 2.59 \u00c5. This is in perfect agreement with the reported literature values.39-43 The\n\n\f7\n\ncovalent nature of Al2 is well seen from the contours of ELF, where both Al basins merge\nconsiderably around a value of 0.76. The FMO analysis predicts that HOMO orbital is bonding orbital\n(\u03c3-overlap) and LUMO is localized on the two Al atoms (p-orbitals). The favorable mode of N2\ninteraction with Al2 is a linear structure as seen from Figure 1. Other modes of interaction\n(perpendicular to the Al-Al bond of Al2 molecule) do not result in local minima. The Al2--N2 complex\nhas an interaction energy of -0.57 eV (-13.10 kcal/mol). Following the adsorption of N2 molecule, the\nAl-Al and N-N bond distances increase marginally from 2.59 to 2.61 \u00c5 and from 1.11 to 1.15 \u00c5,\nrespectively. The Al2--N2 interaction optimizes at an Al-N distance of 1.86 \u00c5. The corresponding ELF\ncontours at an isovalue of 0.76 reveals a polarized electron density on Al(2) and N(1) atoms (see Figure\n1). There are no merged basins in the Al-N bonding region even at an isovalue of 0.50.\nThe HOMO of Al2--N2 complex is composed of 2p orbitals of N atoms while the LUMO is\ncomposed of p orbitals of interacting Al atom and N2 atoms. To understand the charge redistribution\nfollowing the adsorption of N2, we study the difference charge density (\u0394\u03c1) (Figure 1). The blue region\nindicates charge gained where as the red region indicates the charge depletion. The presence of red\nregion along the N2 and Al2 bonds and presence of blue region around the each atom shows a small\npolarization within the whole molecular space. Thus, Al2 and N2, in their interaction show an overall\ncharge transfer from Al2 to N2. In order to quantify the charge transfer we have calculated the Mulliken\ncharges for individual systems and the complex. The charges of Al atoms in the individual Al2 are\n6.6*10-4 a. u. and -6.6*10-4 a. u respectively (and hence nearly zero). The corresponding charges on Al\natoms in the complex are 0.123 a. u. (non-interacting Al atom) and 0.513 a. u (interacting Al atom). The\nN(1) atom (interacting N atom) in N2 shows charge gain of -1.202 a. u. while N(2) is slight positively\ncharged. Thus, both the difference charge density and Mulliken charges reveal an over all charge\ntransfer from Al2 to the N2 molecule.\nThe moderate interaction energy of N2 with Al dimer promotes us to study the nature of N2\ninteraction as a function of cluster size and geometry. Does the bonding remain same for larger cluster\n\n\f8\nsizes? Does interaction energy increase with the cluster size? Various such questions will be addressed\n\nin the next few sections.\n(ii) Structure, Bonding of Al3 and its Interaction with N2 molecule:\n\nA three atom cluster has three possible geometric configurations viz., linear conformation, zigzag conformation and a cyclic conformation.48, 49 The three conformations in Al3 differ from each other\nby nearly 1 eV with cyclic Al3 as the most stable configuration. This is consistent with earlier literature\nreports.48, 49 Cyclic Al3 is an equilateral triangle as shown in Figure 2 with Al-Al bond distances of 2.47\n\u00c5. Thus, we note a decrease in the inter atomic bond distance within the Al atoms as compared to the\nAl2. In spite of the decreased bond distances, the ELF basins merge only at a value of 0.74 as compared\nto 0.76 in Al2. The HOMO of Al3 shows a multi centered bonding arising from the overlap of s-p\nhybridized orbitals. The LUMO is made up of p orbitals of Al atoms. Considering the orbital\ncontributions and their density contours, we verified two modes for N2 adsorption. One perpendicular\nto the plane of triangle and another along one of the Al-Al bonds as shown in Figure 2. The first Al3-N2 conformation was found to be a meta stable one with N2 getting desorbed. However, the second Al3-N2 configuration resulted in a stable minima with an interaction energy of -0.47 eV (i. e. -10.77\nkcal/mol). Interestingly this is nearly 3 kcal/mol lower than that of dimer complex.\nN2 adsorption reduces the symmetry of the Al3 cluster from an equilateral triangle to an nearly\nisosceles triangle. The Al(2)-Al(3) (see Figure 2) increases to 2.64 from 2.47 \u00c5 with rest of the two AlAl bond lengths remaining around their original values. The Al-N interaction converges to the same\nbond length as that in Al2--N2 complex i. e., 1.86 \u00c5. The N2 bond also increases to 1.15 \u00c5 from 1.11 \u00c5\nlike in the case of Al2-N2. The ELF contour of the complex (at an isovalue of 0.80) shows polarization\nof densities on Al(3) atom (the Al atom interacting with N2) and N(1) atom. Similar to Al2--N2 complex,\nAl3--N2 complex does not show merged basins in the Al-N bonding region. The frontier orbital analysis\nshows that HOMO is contributed by the p orbitals of N2, Al(3) and Al(2) atoms. The LUMO is\ncomposed of bonding orbital of Al(1) and Al(2) atoms (the two Al atoms not interacting with N2). The\n\n\f9\ncharges derived by Mulliken population analysis for Al3 and Al3--N2 are given in Figure 2. All the\n\natoms in the Al3 are nearly neutral in the cluster as well as the complex. However, the N2 molecule is\npolarized following the complexation. However, the difference charge density plot shown in Figure 2\nreveals that there has been some charge redistribution among the Al and N atoms. Each atom is seen to\ndonate some electrons from one of its orbital and gain in another of its atomic orbital there by\nneutralizing the overall charge transfer. Thus, Al3, shows a marginal decrease in the interaction energy.\n(iii) Structure, Bonding of Al13 and its Interaction with N2 molecule:\n\nOur next cluster to be studied for N2 adsorption is an Al13 cluster. Al13 is the most well studied\namong the aluminum clusters. Icosahedra (Ih) is indebted global minima in all extensive static and\ndynamic studies of Al13.50 Hence, we found it interesting to chose this as the next larger cluster for N2\nadsorption. Figure 3a shows optimized geometries of Ih, and its N2 complex. We now classify atoms\nwithin the cluster in order to facilitate the discussion of various reactive sites with the cluster and the\nN2 adsorption on them. The Various atomic sites in the Ih conformation can be classified into three\ntypes viz., \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" depending upon their chemical environment and their distances from the\ncentral atom (see Figure 3a). Site A is the single central atom. Site B and C are the surface atoms\ncontaining six atoms each. The atoms \"B\" lie at a distance of 2.66 \u00c5 from the central atom \"A\" and\natoms \"C\" lie at a distance from 2.60 \u00c5 from central atom \"A\". Figure 3b shows another perspective of\nthe Ih conformation for a better understanding of the reactive sites. Thus, the structure is highly\nsymmetric. Table 1 gives details of these inter atomic distances between various types of sites.\nDistances between two adjacent \"B\" atoms is 2.82 \u00c5, while that of two adjacent \"C\" atoms is 2.90 \u00c5.\nOwing to their different orientations with respect to the central atom \"A\", the inter atomic distance\nbetween two diagonally placed \"B\" atoms is 5.32 \u00c5 while the distance between \"C\" atoms is 5.21 \u00c5.\nThe inter-atomic distance between site \"B\" and \"C\" is 2.70 \u00c5.\nThis symmetry is reflected in Mulliken atomic charges (tabulated in Table 1) and ELF\nisosurfaces (seen in Figure 3a). The site A, is positively charged with 3.43 a. u., sites \"B\" and \"C\"\n\n\f10\n\nattracting a negative charge of -0.3 and -0.28 a. u., respectively. Analysis of ELF basins shows that\nELF basins do not merge until a isovalue of 0.75. Around 0.74, basins corresponding to sites \"B\" and\n\"C\" merge with each other. Interestingly, basins of adjacent \"B\" do not merge with each other. Same is\nthe case for adjacent \"C\" atoms. These basins merge at a slightly higher value of 0.72. These results\nindicate an overall covalent nature of the bonds (as in case of Al2 and Al3 clusters), with stronger\nsharing between the negatively charged \"B\" atoms with negatively charged \"C\" atoms. These bonding\npeculiarities of Ih geometry are also reproduced in the FMO's. Analysis of HOMO reveals a multi\ncentered bonding contributed by \"C\" atoms in the same plane as seen in Figure 3a. However, the\nLUMO is contributed by only \"B\" atoms.\nFollowing the analysis of FMO and ELF, site \"B\" and \"C\" appear to be susceptible51 to the N2\nattack. Hence, we have studied the adsorption of N2 on both these sites. The adsorption of N2 on site\n\"B\" results in a meta-stable structure with finally N2, desorbing from it. The adsorption of N2 on site\n\"C\" results on the other hand in a stable conformation with an interaction energy of -0.34 eV (-7.91\nkcal/mol). Interestingly, this is nearly half of that found for O2 molecule on Al13 (-0.77 eV) reported by\nShiv Khanna and co-workers47. They attribute such a low interaction energy of Al13 to its magic cluster\nproperty (exceptional stability) and hence its nonreactive behavior towards many reagents. The\nmarginally lower interaction energy of Al13 towards N2 molecule as compared to Al2 and Al3 is\nreflected in its Al-N bond distance (which is 1.90 \u00c5 as compared to 1.86 \u00c5 in Al2 and Al3 complex).\nThe N-N bond distance in the complex is 1.13 \u00c5 as compared to 1.15 \u00c5 in Al2 and Al3.\nFollowing the N2 adsorption there is a small loss of symmetry. For the sake of better\nunderstanding of structural changes following the adsorption we rename the interacting \"C\" atom as\n\"Cint\". The \"A\"-\"C\" bond distance in the Al13(Ih)--N2 complex reduces to 2.54 \u00c5 from 2.60 \u00c5, \"A\"\"Cint\" increases to 2.63 \u00c5 from 2.60 \u00c5. Similarly, \"B\"-\"C\" bonds increase to 2.78 \u00c5 from 2.70 \u00c5. The\n\"A\"-\"B\" and \"B\"-\"B\" bond distances in the complex remain around their original values. The distance\nbetween \"C\"-\"C\" is 2.86 \u00c5 in the complex as compared to \"C\"-\"C\" distance of 2.90 \u00c5 in Ih. The\n\n\f11\ninteratomic distances between the diagonally opposite \"B\" atoms in complex is 5.50 \u00c5 (as compared\n\nto 5.32 \u00c5) and that between diagonally opposite \"C\" atoms is 5.28 \u00c5 (as compared to 5.21 \u00c5). Thus,\nthe volume of the cluster increases marginally following the N2 adsorption.\nAnalysis of FMO's shows that HOMO is contributed by the interacting Al atom, and some\nlower plane of atoms in the cluster. The charge distribution in Al13--N2 complex is given in Table 1.\nThere is an overall charge transfer of 0.21 electrons to N2 from Al13 atom. It may be noted that this is\nless than that seen in Al2 but more than what is seen for Al3. The Al atom bonded to the N2 molecule\nacquires a positive charge of 0.81 a. u. As a consequence, following the charge transfer (see Figure 3c),\nthe atoms on upper half (atoms above the central atom \"A\") of Al13 are more negatively charged\ncompared to those on lower half (atoms below the central atom \"A\"). The finer details of the charge\ndistribution (see Figure 3c) show that the positive charge on central atom \"A\" increases marginally by\n0.05 a. u.\nThe ELF of Al13--N2 complex is shown in Figure 3a. It is interesting to note that there is lesser\npolarization of electron density around N2 as compared to the case of Al2 and Al3. This and the fact that\nthe first merging of the basins occurs only at 0.76 isovalue reflects the lower interaction between the\nAl13 and N2.\n(iv) Structure, Bonding of Al30 and its Interaction with N2 molecule:\n\nTo evaluate the adsorption energy of N2 molecule as a function of cluster size, we next consider\na 30 atom cluster. There have been quite a few recent reports on the lowest energy conformation of\nAl30. One of the reports has suggested a double tetrahedron as a local minima for Al30.52 Recent reports,\non the other hand have reported few other conformations as the lowest energy geometry for Al30.53, 54\nHowever, we have used the double tetrahedron for the case of N2 adsorption. The geometries of Al30\nand its complex with N2 and various other properties are given in Figure 4. Based on symmetry, the\natoms in the cluster can be classified into 7 types of sites as shown in Figure 4. The inter-atomic\ndistances between various sites are reported in Table 2. It is seen from the Table that the edge atoms are\n\n\f12\nfar from central atom (\"E\"). These bonds lay in the range 3.78 \u00c5 to 6.47 \u00c5. On the other hand,\n\nsurface atoms F and G lie at optimal distance of 2.75 \u00c5 from central atom while their corresponding\ndistances with adjacent surface and edge atoms is slightly longer. The bond lengths among edge atoms\nviz., \"A\"-\"B\" (2.65 \u00c5), \"B\"-\"C\" (2.65 \u00c5) and \"C\"-\"D\" (2.59 \u00c5) are the shortest ones.\nThe short bond distance between the edge atoms is well reflected in the ELF plots (see Figure\n4). At an isosurface of 0.86 the basins of all edge atoms merge. However, at the same value, the basins\non surface atoms remain as such which merge at a lower value of 0.74. The HOMO of this\nconformation is mainly contributed by \"A\" and \"B\" atoms. The LUMO is contributed by \"C\" and \"D\".\nConsidering the FMO contributions, N2 can preferably adsorb on the edge atoms \"A\", \"B\" \"C\", and\n\"D\" atoms.\nFirst, we consider site \"A\" for N2 adsorption (see Figure 4). The Al-N and N-N bonds optimize\nto 1.86 \u00c5 and 1.13 \u00c5 respectively as in the case of Al13. The interaction energy falls in the same range\nas observed for the earlier clusters, i. e. 8.01 kcal/mol. The structural details of Al30-N2 complex are\nreported in Table 2. Although, the original double tetrahedron is not distorted much, there are some\nsmall perturbations following the N2 adsorption. Notable among them are the inter-atomic distances\nbetween site \"C\" and \"D\" which increases and consequently, ELF at 0.86 show some disconnected\nbasins. The basin around site A atom, involved in Al-N bond, disappears. The HOMO of the complex is\nformed of P-P orbital overlap of site C, site D edge and site F, site G surface atoms. However, the\nLUMO is similar to the LUMO of bare Al30. In addition to this, LUMO is also present on N2 molecule.\nIn the above Al30--N2 complex, the N2 is adsorbed vertically on the site A. Adsorption of N2\nmolecule on sites B and C result in similar interaction energies and electronic properties. We have also\nattempted a case of multiple bonding where N2 molecule adsorbs on site B with slight inclination\ntowards site C, forming a bridge. However, this orientation results into a conformation where N2\nadsorbs only on site B atom with more or less same interaction energy.\n(v) Structure, Bonding of Al100 and its Interaction with N2 molecule:\n\n\f13\nWe must not forget that the original work reported by Jarrold et. al. is on Al100 cluster. Hence,\n\nto check the N2 interaction with such a large cluster, we consider one of the potential minima of Al100\ncluster. It is difficult to illustrate the in detail structural parameters of 100 atom clusters, hence, we only\noutline the peculiarities found in bonding those obtained from ELF and FMO reported in Figure 5. The\nFigure 5 shows that most of the Al atoms are clustered on the surface and very few of them form the\ncore. The covalency of Al100 cluster is as good as that of symmetrical Al30 cluster. The basins on the\nsurface atoms start merging at an 0.84 isovalue. The HOMO, is centered on many surface atoms,\nparticularly showing the multi-centered bonding resembling that of Ih HOMO. The N2 is adsorbed on\none of the free sites. The interaction energy is 7 kcal/mol with an optimized Al-N bond of 1.91 \u00c5. The\nN-N elongation, here, is to the same magnitude of 1.13 \u00c5. Similar to small sized Al cluster N2 complex,\nELF does not show and merged basins along Al-N bond. The ELF contours merge at lower isovalue of\n0.80 resulting in further reduction of covalency. The HOMO of Al100--N2 is localized on both N atoms\nand interacting Al atom. On the contrary, N2 also participates in LUMO formation. Thus, the interaction\nenergy of N2 molecule with the ground state conformation does not seem to vary substantially with\nrespect to the cluster size.\n(b) Structure, Bonding and Interaction of High Energy Al13 conformations with N2 Molecule:\n(i) Decehedron (Dh):\n\nAs discussed in Section I, N2 adsorption on Al clusters increases dramatically above\ntemperatures which correspond to the phase transition of the later. Just below and above the phase\ntransition, clusters visit several high energy conformations. Such high energy conformations exhibit\ncontrastingly different structural and electronic properties (particularly the surface atoms) as compared\nto the ground state conformations. One of the objectives of this work is to understand if such a change\nin surface properties can contribute to better adsorption of N2 (and hence better reactivity) on Al\nclusters. Hence, we next study some of the high energy conformations of Al clusters and N2 adsorption\non them. For this purpose, we have chosen high energy conformations of Al13 as a case study. It has\n\n\f37\n\nbeen reported earlier that Al13 undergoes a phase transition around 1400 K.\n\n14\nDecahedron is a\n\ndominant high energy conformation of Al13 seen from 400 K to 1200 K.37 Hence, we found it\ninteresting to study the adsorption of N2 on this conformation. In addition, we have also chosen two\nhigh energy conformations from a finite temperature run of 1600 K. In the next few sections, we\ndiscuss the structure and bonding of these high energy conformations and their implications on the N2\nadsorption.\nWe begin with a discussion on decahedron (Dh). Figure 6 shows the structural details of this\nconformation. Dh having lower symmetry than that of Ih, the atoms within it can be classified into 5\ntypes. Figure 6 shows five unique sites (as compared to three seen in Ih). The central atom, \"A\" is\nbonded to two vertex atoms \"B\" with an interatomic distance of 2.66 \u00c5. Rest of the ten atoms form two\nplanes between the central atom and two vertex atoms and are classified as \"C\", \"D\" and \"E\" based on\nthe symmetry (See Figure 6). The inter atomic distances between various sites are tabulated in Table 3.\nInterestingly, the inter atomic distances between sites \"E\" and \"D\" (i. e. \"D\"-\"D\" and \"E\"-\"E\" bond\ndistances) are 2.59 \u00c5, same as that of Al2 dimer. Such a short bond distance is indicative of covalent\nbonding between these atoms. \"C\"-\"C\" bonds are the next shortest ones (2.63 \u00c5) Thus, intra-planar\natoms are bonded to each other with strong covalent bonds. The inter-planar bond distances viz., \"C\"\"D\" and \"D\"-\"E\" are marginally longer with a reasonably large bond distances of 2.70 \u00c5 and 2.81 \u00c5,\nrespectively. Rest of the bond distances lay in the order of 2.66-2.72 \u00c5. Analysis of ELF basins reveals\nthe covalent nature of bonding across the two planes. The ELF basins of same sites merge at a high\nisovalue of 0.90, whereas those across the two planes merge at 0.78 isovalue.(see Figure 6). Thus, Dh\nconformation is a more covalently bonded conformation as compared to the ground state Ih\nconformation of Al13. The Mulliken charges on each site are given in Table 3. All the surface atoms are\nnegatively charged resulting in a positively charged central atom. The atoms in the two planes are the\nmost negatively charged ones.\nThe HOMO and LUMO of Dh are reported in the Figure 6. The HOMO contributed by the\n\n\f15\nbonding orbitals of p-p overlap between the \"C\"-\"C\", \"D\"-\"D\" and \"E\"-\"E\" atoms while LUMO is\n\nconcentrated only on site B i. e. vertex atom. Considering the contribution of various atoms to HOMO\nand LUMO, we finalize four sites for N2 interaction, viz., \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" and \"E\". Interestingly, sites\n\"B\" and \"C\" do not show any reactivity towards N2 adsorption. All orientations of N2 on these two sites\nresulted in high energy structures with N2 getting finally separated. The presence of highly covalent\nbonds around site \"C\" may be a probable reason for desorption on that site, site \"B\" being least\nnegatively charged may be unfavorable for the N2 adsorption. However, sites \"D\" and \"E\" are better for\nN2 adsorption leading to stable complexes. The site E gives elevated interaction energy compared to\nsite D. In both these optimizations although we started with initial Dh geometry, the final complex\nobtained was nearly Ih--N2 complex. That is during optimization Dh structure transforms into an Ih\nstructure. This has been found to be the case irrespective of the optimization algorithm and initial\norientations of N2 molecule on these sites. Thus, N2 adsorbed and stabilized complex is no more Dh--N2\ncomplex but it is same as original Ih--N2 complex. This change of geometry reflects in ELF and FMO\nplots shown in Figure 6 which shows that the contours of this complex are analogous to those in\noriginal Ih--N2 complex. However, the strength of interaction at both sites, D and E, is different. Site E\nshows almost double interaction energy than that of site D, The interaction energy at site E is 15.86\nkcal/mol and the same at site D is 8.28 kcal/mol. These high energies of interaction are obtained from\nusing definition of interaction energy as follows,\nInteraction Energy = Ecomplex \u2013 (E1 + E2)\n\n(1)\n\nWhere, Ecomplex is energy of complex which is converted to N2 adsorbed Ih geometry. E1 is energy of\noptimized Dh and E2 is energy of optimized N2. Since, final complex is no longer Dh, if we substitute E1\nas energy of optimized Ih, both interaction energies (at site D and site E) decrease significantly. In the\nlater case site D is almost not bonded to N2 (IE ~ 0.0 kcal) where as interaction of site E and N2 is just\nsame as original Ih--N2 complex. As a consequence of this Dh turned Ih--N2 complex shows similar\nbehavior of bonding as described above in Ih section. Rest of the geometrical parameters of this final\n\n\f16\n\ncomplex are same as those found in Ih--N2 complex.\n(ii) High Energy Conformations H1 and H2:\n\nWe next attempt the adsorption of N2 molecule on some of the high energy Al13 conformations\nwhich are not so well known. As mentioned earlier, these conformations have been extracted from an\nmolecular dynamical simulation of the Al13--Ih cluster around 1400 K. Figure 7 gives one of the\nperspectives of both these two clusters. It is clearly seen that these high energy conformations are\ndistorted leading to as many chemically unequal sites. H1 has nine chemically (Site \"A\" to Site \"I\" as\nshown in Figure 7) unequal sites while H2 has as many sites as the number of atoms within it. The high\nenergy conformation H1 appears to be a hybrid of Ih and Dh conformations. The ELF at an isosurface of\n0.90 reveals that both these conformations are characterized by the presence of covalent bonds at few\npockets of the clusters. The inter atomic distances between the atoms in the two clusters range from\n2.54 to 2.84 \u00c5. The charge distribution as obtained from the Mulliken population analysis for both the\nconformations is given in Table 4. It is seen from the Table that the atoms on the surface are mostly\nnegatively charged and the central atoms are positively charged. Upon adsorption of N2, H1\nconformations results in a stable complex with an adsorption energy of 7.65 kcal/mol while adsorption\nof N2 on H2 conformations leads to an interaction energy of 13.54 kcal/mol. Interaction energy\nincreases by approximately 5 kcal/mol for a high melted and distorted structure H2, however, the case\nis not same for H1--N2 complex.\nThus, interestingly it appears that varying the cluster size and just the reorientation of the bonds\ndoes not contribute significantly to the better adsorption of N2 on Al clusters. The clear understanding\nof this elevated strength of interaction in case of H2 conformer can be understood with keen\nobservation of the FMOs. The HOMO (see Figure 7) is dominantly spread over Al (7). In addition this\nis the least bonded and hence free site. The N2 is adsorbed in a plane of triangle made up of Al(5), Al(7)\nand Al(12) atoms. This forms a stable complex with Al-N bond optimized to 1.90 \u00c5. Here, the increase\nin interaction energy however is not ascribed by nature of H2 directly but is approved by additional Al-\n\n\f17\nN bond formed between Al(12) and N(1). The characteristic bond formed so is 2.93 \u00c5. The N-N\n\nelongation is 1.13 \u00c5. The Al(7)-Al(12) bond in bare H2 is 2.58 \u00c5. In the respective complex, the Al(12)\nis close to Al(7). This bond reduces to 2.55 \u00c5 as N2 approaches to Al(7) and thus retains a favorable\ngeometry to form another Al-N bond (see Figure 7, H2--N2 HOMO). There is no specific trend i. e.\nbond elongation or reduction observed in H2--N2 complex formation. In general, the bonds in close\nvicinity of Al(7) show bond reduction. We also summarize the atomic charges on the interacting Al and\nN atoms. Let us concentrate on the atomic charges which participate in Al-N bond. A positive charge of\n0.38 a .u. is built on the Al(7). The Al(12) atom is also bonded with N(1). Hence, the Al(12) pulls\ncharge of -0.34 a. u. from N(1). The N(1) here, hence, acquires slightly less negative charge compared\nto other N2 complexes.\nThus after studying various conformers of Al13 and their interaction with N2, we can conclude\nthat in case of Al13, the N2 interaction is not just dependent on structural arrangement of atom but is\nalso a function of multiple bonding of N2 with Al cluster. In other words, the highly melted or deformed\nstructure where adjacent Al-Al bonds are not so strongly coordinated, N2 can interact to form various\nAl-N bonds resulting in highly stable (Al)n--N2 complex. This is validated by the analysis of average\ninteratomic Al-Al distances in Al13 clusters. The average interatomic distance shows a substantial\nincrease in H2, a highly melted structure (3.91) as compared to 3.59, 3.65 and 3.70 in Ih, Dh and H1\nrespectively. Here, we must address that N2 adsorption is carried out on a melted structure obtained\nafter phase transition and no temperature effect is consider while its interaction. Thus, to count its\nchemisorption as mentioned by Jarrold et. al. we must bring in the thermal effects with the help of\ndynamics. Hence, in our next paper, we plan to study the high temperature thermodynamics to obtain\nhighly melted 100 atom cluster, followed by the room temperature reaction of N2 adsorption.\nIV. Conclusion and Scope\n\nDensity Functional Calculations have been carried out to understand the adsorption of the N2\nmolecule on the ground state geometries of Aln clusters (n=2, 3, 13, 30, 100). The studies were also\n\n\f18\n\nextended to few high energy conformations of Al13. We summarize the adsorption energies of N2\nmolecule on these ground state geometries and high energy conformations of Al13 clusters in Figure 8.\nWith the exception of Al2, all other ground state conformations show interaction energy between 8-10\nkcal/mol. As seen from the figure, the interaction energy is stable with respect to the cluster size. This\ninteraction is mostly accompanied by a charge transfer from Al atoms to the nitrogen atoms in the\ncomplex. The bonding within ground state geometries in all cluster sizes is partially covalent and\npartially metallic. However, the extent of covalancy is seen to vary to some extent between the various\nsized clusters. Thus, independent of the electronic and structural properties, N2 interacts weakly (an\nionic bond) with the ground state geometries of Al clusters. The presence of high energy conformations\nof Al13 on the N2 adsorption is seen to give mixed results with some high energy conformations leading\nto similar interaction energies as that of a ground state conformation (Decahedron and H1), whereas,\nhigh energy conformation of Al13, viz., H2 is seen to favor the N2 adsorption better due to the presence\nof more than one Al-N bond. Such multiple bonds between the ligand molecule and cluster are, thus, a\ncharacterstic phenomenon of high temperatures. This is a consequence of increased interatomic\ndistances between the Al-Al atoms (and thus weaker bonds) following the melting. Thus, the above\nwork indicates that the enhancement of reactivity of melted Al clusters is more due to therodynamic\nfactors and electronic factors play a minor role in the increasing adsorption energy of N2 molecule.\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors (BSK) acknowledges CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research)\nfor funding of the SRF (Senior Research Fellowship).
