As a significant increase in the number of\nprocessors, processor failure is inevitable. In order to ensure the stable running of the systems,\nwe must find out the faulty processors and repair or replace them. System-level diagnosis, as a\npowerful tool, has been widely used. The basic idea is to design an effective algorithm to find\nout faulty processors through a comprehensive analysis of test results which are stimulated\nby adjacent processors. This method does not have to use special equipment to test.\nMost of the recent research efforts in system-level diagnosis have focused on enhancing the\napplicability of system-level diagnosis-based approaches to practical scenarios such as VLSI\ntesting [8], diagnosis of interconnection networks employed in parallel computers [11, 12].\nThe classical diagnosability of a system is small owing to the fact that it ignores the unlikelihood of the corresponding processors failing at the same time. Therefore, it is attractive to\ndevelop more different measures of diagnosability based on application environment, network\ntopology, network reliability, and statistics related to fault patterns. The self-diagnosis of\nsystem is implemented without additional cost which has a very high value in practice.\nThe work was supported by NNSF of China (No. 61072080, No.11071233, 60973014), Specialized Research\nFund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No.200801411073), and the Key Project of\nFujian Provincial Universities services to the western coast of the straits-Information Technology Research\nBased on Mathematics.\n\u2217\n\n\fThe PMC model, proposed by Preparata et al. [15] for dealing with the System's selfdiagnosis, assumed that each node can test its neighboring nodes, and test results are \"faulty\"\nor \"fault-free\". Under this model, the diagnosability of an interconnection network is the\nmaximum number of faulty nodes in the system that can be identified. To grant more\naccurate measurement of diagnosability for a large-scale processing system, Lai et al. [11]\nintroduce the conditional diagnosability of a system under the PMC model, which suppose\nthe probability that all adjacent nodes of one node are faulty simultaneously is very small.\nThat is, conditional diagnosability is the diagnoability under the condition that all adjacent\nnodes of any node can't be faulty simultaneously. They further showed that the conditional\ndiagnosability of Qn is 4(n \u2212 2) + 1 for n \u2265 5. Xu et al. [18] established the conditional\ndiagnosability of matching composition networks MCN under PMC model, which generalized\nthe result on BC networks investigated by Zhu [22]. Xu et al. [19] studied the conditional\ndiagnosability of Shuffle-cubes under the PMC model. Zhu et al. [22] showed that the\nconditional diagnosability of folded hypercubes F Qn is 4n \u2212 3 for n \u2265 8. Recently, Fan et\nal. [7] have derived the diagnosability of DCC linear congruential graphs under the precise\nand pessimistic strategies based on the PMC diagnostic model. N.W. Chang, S.Y. Hsieh [3]\nstudied the conditional diagnosability of augmented cubes under the PMC model.\nThis paper establishes the conditional diagnosability of the bubble sort graph Bn under the\nPMC model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce\nsome terminology and preliminaries used through this paper. Section 3 concentrates on the\nconditional diagnosability of Bn . Section 4 concludes the paper.\n\n2\n\nTerminologies and Preliminaries\n\nFor notation and terminology not defined here we follow [20]. A multi-processor system, whose\ntopological structure is an interconnection network, can be modeled as a simple undirected\ngraph G(V, E), where a vertex u \u2208 V represents a processor and an edge (u, v) \u2208 E represents\na link between vertices u and v. If at least one end of an edge is faulty, the edge is said to be\nfaulty; otherwise, the edge is said to be fault-free. The connectivity of a graph G, denoted\nby \u03ba(G), is the minimum number of vertices whose deletion results in a disconnected graph\nor a trivial graph. The components of a graph G are its maximal connected subgraphs. A\ncomponent is trivial if it has no edges; otherwise, it is nontrivial. The neighborhood set of\nthe vertex set X \u2282 V (G) is defined as NG (X) = {y \u2208 V (G) | \u2203 x \u2208 X such that (x, y) \u2208\nE(G)} \u2212 X. For convenience, |S| denotes the number of elements in the set S. And we also\nuse |G| to represent the number of vertices in the graph G.\nThe P M C model requires that u and v can test each other for any edge (u, v) \u2208 E(G).\nWhen u tests v, we call u as testing node, and call v as tested node. The test output is 0 (or\n1) which implies that v is faulty ( or faulty-free). \u03c3(u, v) denotes the output of u testing v.\nAnd it is assumed that the test outputs are correct if the testing node is fault-free; otherwise\nthe outputs are unreliable.\nThe collection of all outputs is called the syndrome \u03c3. For a given syndrome \u03c3, a subset\nof vertices F \u2282 V (G) is said to be consistent with \u03c3 if the syndrome \u03c3 can be produced from\nthe situation that, for \u2200(u, v) \u2208 E such that u \u2208 V \u2212 F , \u03c3(u, v) = 1 if and only if v \u2208 F . It\nmeans that F is a possible set of faulty nodes. Since test output produced by a faulty node\nis unreliable, a given set F of faulty nodes may produce different syndromes. On the other\nhand, different faulty sets may produce the same syndrome. Let \u03c3(F ) represent the set of\nall syndromes that could be produced by F . Two distinct sets F1 , F2 \u2282 V are said to be\ndistinguishable if \u03c3(F1 ) \u2229 \u03c3(F2 ) = \u2205; otherwise, F1 and F2 are said to be indistinguishable.\nWe say that (F1 , F2 ) is a distinguishable pair if \u03c3(F1 ) \u2229 \u03c3(F2 ) = \u2205; otherwise, (F1 , F2 ) is an\nindistinguishable pair. We also use F1 \u2206F2 = (F1 \u2212 F2 ) \u222a (F2 \u2212 F1 ) to denote the symmetric\ndifference of F1 and F2 .\n\n\fDefinition 1. [11, 15] A system G is said to be t\u2212diagnosable if, a given syndrome can be\nproduced by a unique faulty set, provided that the number of faulty nodes present in the system\ndoes not exceed t. The largest value of t, for which a given system G is t\u2212diagnosable, is\ncalled the diagnosability of system G, denoted as t(G).\nLemma 1. [11, 15] For any two distinct sets F1 , F2 \u2282 V (G) of graph G = (V, E), (F1 , F2 ) is\na distinguishable pair iff there exists a vertex u \u2208 V (G) \u2212 (F1 \u222a F2 ) and there exists a vertex\nv \u2208 F1 \u2206F2 such that (u, v) \u2208 E(G).\n\u0003\nSo, if two sets F1 and F2 are indistinguishable, then there is no edge between F1 \u2206F2 and\nV (G) \u2212 (F1 \u222a F2 ).\nDefinition 2. [11] A faulty set F \u2282 V (G) is called a conditional fault-set, if N (v) * F for\nany vertex v \u2208 V (G).\nDefinition 3. [11] A system G is said to be conditionally t\u2212diagnosable, if for any two distinct conditional fault-sets F1 , F2 \u2282 V (G) with |F1 | \u2264 t, |F2 | \u2264 t, (F1 , F2 ) is a distinguishable\npair. The largest value of t which makes system G is conditionally t\u2212diagnosable is called\nthe conditional diagnosability of system G, denoted as tc (G).\nLemma 2. [11] A system G is said to be t\u2212diagnosable under the PMC model, if and only\nif \u2200F1 , F2 \u2282 V (G), F1 6= F2 with |F1 | \u2264 t, |F2 | \u2264 t, (F1 , F2 ) is a distinguishable pair.\n\u0003\nAn equivalent way of stating the lemma is the following.\nLemma 3. [11] A system G is said to be t\u2212diagnosable under the PMC model, if and only\nif for an indistingushable pair of sets F1 , F2 \u2282 V (G), it implies that |F1 | > t or |F2 | > t. \u0003\nLemma 4. Let G(V, E) be a multi-processor system, and (F1 , F2 ) be an indistinguishable\nconditional pair with F1 6= F2 , then\n\u0001 the following two conditions\n\u0001 hold:\n(1) |N (u) \u2229 V \u2212 (F1 \u222a F2 ) | \u2265 1 for u \u2208 V \u2212 (F1 \u222a F2 ) ;\n(2) |N (v) \u2229 (F1 \u2212 F2 )| \u2265 1 and |N (v) \u2229 (F2 \u2212 F1 )| \u2265 1 for v \u2208 F1 \u2206F2 .\n\u0003\nLet (F1 , F2 ) be an indistinguishable conditional pair, and let S = F1 \u2229F2 . By observation,\nevery component of G \u2212 S is nontrivial. Moreover, we have\n(1) for each component C1 of G\u2212S, if C1 \u2229(F1 \u25b3F2 ) = \u2205, then degC1 (v) \u2265 1 for v \u2208 V (C1 );\n(2) for each component C2 of G\u2212S, if C2 \u2229(F1 \u25b3F2 ) 6= \u2205, then degC2 (v) \u2265 2 for v \u2208 V (C2 ).\nNetwork reliability is one of the major factors in designing the topology of an interconnection network. The hypercubes and its variants were the first major class of interconnection\nnetworks. The n-star graph (Sn for short), which proposed by Akers et al., is an attractive\nalternative to the hypercube [1]. The bubble-sort graphs similar to the n-star graph [6],\nwhich belongs to the class of Cayley graphs, have been attractive alternative to the hypercubes. They have some good topological properties such as highly symmetry and recursive\nstructure. In particular, the n-dimensional bubble-sort graph Bn is vertex transitive, while\nit is not edge transitive [13]. The connectivity of Bn is n \u2212 1 and the diameter is n(n \u2212 1)/2.\nIt was shown that finding a shortest path in Bn can be accomplished by using the familiar\nbubble-sort algorithm [1]. K. Kaneko, Y. Suzuki [9] proposed a polynomial time algorithm\nfor finding disjoint paths in Bn . Y. Suzuki and K. Kaneko [17] gave an O(n5 )-time algorithm\nthat solves the node-to-set disjoint paths problem in Bn . Y. Kikuchi and T. Araki [10] have\nshown that the bubble sort graph Bn is edge-bipancyclic for n \u2265 5, and Bn \u2212 F is bipancyclic\nwhen n \u2265 4 and |F | \u2264 n \u2212 3, where F is a subset of E(Bn ). T. Araki and Y. Kikuchi [2]\nshowed that the bubble-sort graph Bn is hyper-hamiltonian laceable for n \u2265 4, and Bn is\nstill hamiltonian laceable and strongly hamiltonian laceable if there are at most n \u2212 3 faulty\nedges. L.M. Shih et al. [16] showed that the bubble-sort graph is fault tolerant maximal local\nconnected.\n\n\fNow, we introduce the bubble-sort graphs. An n-dimensional bubble-sort graph is (n \u2212\n1)\u2212regular and symmetric. It has n! nodes and (n\u22121)n!\nedges while its connectivity and\n2\nn(n\u22121)\n, respectively.\ndiameter are n \u2212 1 and\n2\nThe bubble-sort graph can be equivalently defined by using adjacent swapping operation\nwith the following fashion (see Fig.1).\nDefinition 4. (bubble-sort graph) An n-bubble-sort graph Bn has n! nodes. Each node has a\nunique address, which is a permutation of n symbols 1, 2, . . . , n. A node that has an address\nu = u1 u2 . . . un is adjacent to node whose address is ui = u1 u2 . . . ui\u22121 ui+1 ui . . . un with\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1.\n\nFig.1 The bubble sort graph B4 .\nA very important property of the bubble-sort graph is its recursive structure [2]. We decompose Bn into n subgraphs Bni (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) such that each Bni fixes i in the last position\nof the label strings which represents the vertices, and so Bni is isomorphic to Bn\u22121 . Let\nSi = S \u2229 Bni for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, the ith element of the label of vertex u in Bn is\nrepresented by u[i]. An edge e = xy is called a pair-edge if x[n] = y[n] and x[n \u2212 1] = y[n \u2212 1].\ne = x\u2032 y \u2032 is called the coupled pair-edge corresponding to e = xy, where x\u2032 [n] = x[n \u2212 1], and\ny \u2032 [n] = y[n \u2212 1]. We call two edge, xx\u2032 and yy \u2032 , the coupler or two pair-edge e = xy and\ne\u2032 = x\u2032 y \u2032 .\nLet S be a faulty set of V (Bn ). Denote A1 = {Bni | Bni contains at least n \u2212 2 nodes in\nS}, and A2 = {Bni | Bni contains at most n \u2212 3 nodes in S}. we also denote A2 the subgraph\nof Bn induced by the union of subgraphs in A2 .\nLemma 5. A2 \u2212 S is connected.\nProof. If |A2 | = 0 then there is nothing to do, and so assume |A2 | \u2265 1. If |A2 | = 1, then\nthe lemma holds, since Bni in A2 is n \u2212 2-connected. Assume |A2 | \u2265 2 below. To prove the\nlemma, we only need to show that Bni and Bnj are connected in A2 \u2212 S for any two distinct\nBni and Bnj in A2 .\nObviously, each of Bni and Bnj is connected. Since vertex u = u1 u2 . . . un\u22122 ij \u2208 Bnj links to\nvertex v = u1 u2 . . . un\u22122 ji \u2208 Bni with the same first n \u2212 2 positions of the label strings, there\nare (n \u2212 2)! matching edges between Bni and Bnj , that is to say these edges are non-adjacent.\nBecause (n \u2212 2)! > 2(n \u2212 3) for n \u2265 5, there exists at least one fault edge between Bni and\nBnj . Thus Bni is connected to Bnj , thus A2 \u2212 F is connected.\n\n\f3\n\nConditional Diagnosability of Bn\n\nWe decompose Bn into n subgraphs Bni (i = 1, 2, ..., n) such that all vertices of Bni have the\nsame last bit i of the label strings which represents the vertices and Bni \u223c\n= Bn\u22121 .\nLemma 6. tc (Bn ) \u2264 4n \u2212 11.\nProof. Let e = xy be one pair-edge with the coupled pair-edge e\u2032 = x\u2032 y \u2032 . These two pair-edges\nwith their coupler constitute a cycle of length of 4. Obviously, |NBn (x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 )| = 4(n \u2212 3).\nLet F1 = N {x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 } \u222a {x, y}, F2 = N {x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 } \u222a {x\u2032 , y \u2032 }. It is easy to check that F1 , F2\nare two indistinguishable conditional fault-sets, and |F1 | = |F2 | = 4(n \u2212 1 \u2212 2) + 2 = 4n \u2212 10.\nThus, tc (Bn ) \u2264 4n \u2212 11.\nWe are now ready to show the conditional diagnosability of Bn is 4n \u2212 11 for n \u2265 5. Let\nF1 , F2 \u2282 V (Bn ), and (F1 , F2 ) be an indistinguishable conditional-pair for n \u2265 5. We shall\nshow our result by proving that either |F1 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10 or |F2 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nLemma 7. For any two indistinguishable conditional fault-sets F1 , F2 in Bn with n \u2265 5,\nwhich satisfies F1 6= F2 , we have either |F1 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10 or |F2 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nProof. Since (F1 , F2 ) is an indistinguishable conditional-pair, there exists no edge between\nF1 \u2206F2 and Bn \u2212 (F1 \u222a F2 ) by Lemma 1. Define S = F1 \u2229 F2 and let Bn [F1 \u2206F2 ] be the\nsubgraph of Bn induced by the vertex set F1 \u2206F2 . We choose a maximal component C in\nBn [F1 \u2206F2 ] when Bn [F1 \u2206F2 ] is not connected; otherwise, let C = Bn [F1 \u2206F2 ]. By lemma 4,\nwe have |C| \u2265 4. Thus, we only need to prove \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10, which implies that\n|F1 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10 or |F2 | \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nWe decompose Bn into n subgraphs Bni (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) such that each Bni fixes i in the last\nposition of the label strings which represents the vertices. Let Si = S \u2229 Bni for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nIf |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 12, then we have \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10 for |C| \u2265 4, so the lemma holds.\nNow, we only consider the situation |S| \u2264 4n \u2212 13.\nLet A1 = {Bni | Bni contains at least n \u2212 2 nodes in S}, and A2 = {Bni | Bni contains\nat most n \u2212 3 nodes in S}. Obviously, A1 has at most three elements by the fact that\n4(n \u2212 2) > 4n \u2212 12.\nIf A1 = \u03c6, by lemma 5 we have |C| \u2265 (n \u2212 3)[(n \u2212 1)! \u2212 (n \u2212 3)] > 2(4n \u2212 12) for n \u2265 5.\nThus, we have \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10. Now, we consider A1 6= \u03c6 as follows.\nCase 1. C \u2229 (A2 \u2212 S) 6= \u03c6.\nSince A1 has at most three subgraphs, we have |C| \u2265 (n\u22123)[(n\u22121)!\u2212(n\u22123)] \u2265 2(4n\u221210)\nfor n \u2265 5; and we arrive at the result.\nCase 2. C \u2229 (A2 \u2212 S) = \u03c6.\nObviously, C \u2282 A1 , NA2 (C) \u2282 S \u2229 A2 by the maximality of C. Now, we divide this case\ninto three subcases below.\nSubcase 2.1. There is exactly one subgraph, say X, in A1 .\nSince every vertex of C \u2229 X has exactly one neighbor outside of X, we have NBn \u2212X (C) \u2282\nS \u2229 A2 ; and so |NBn \u2212X (C)| = |C|. Obviously, NX (C) \u2282 S \u2229 X. Since |C| \u2265 4, let T be a\npath of length three in C. Obviously, NX (C) \u2287 NX (T ) \u2212 (C \u2212 T ), and so\n|NX (C)| \u2265 |NX (T )| \u2212 (|C \u2212 T |) \u2265 4n \u2212 12 \u2212 |C|.\nSince S = (S \u2229 X) \u222a (S \u2229 A2 ), we have\n|S| = |S \u2229 X| + |S \u2229 A2 | \u2265 |NX (C)| + |NBn \u2212X (C)| \u2265 4n \u2212 12.\nThus, we have \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nSubcase 2.2. There are exactly two subgraphs, say X and Y , in A1 .\n\n\fWe assume, without loss of generality, that |C \u2229 X| \u2265 |C \u2229 Y |. For any x \u2208 C \u2229 X,\n|NC (x)| \u2265 2 by Lemma 4 and every vertex of Bni has exactly one neighbor outside of this\nsubgraph, then we have |C \u2229 X| \u2265 |C \u2229 Y | \u2265 2. Due to NX (C \u2229 X) \u2282 S \u2229 X, and C \u2229 X\nhas at least two vertices, |S \u2229 X| \u2265 |NX (C \u2229 X)| \u2265 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2. Similarly, we have\n|S \u2229 Y | \u2265 |NY (C \u2229 Y )| \u2265 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2. Since every pair of S \u2229 X, S \u2229 Y , S \u2229 A2 are disjoint,\nwe have\nS = (S \u2229 X) \u222a (S \u2229 Y ) \u222a (S \u2229 A2 ) \u2287 NX (C \u2229 X) \u222a NY (C \u2229 Y ) \u222a S \u2229 A2 .\nThen we have\n|S| \u2265 |NX (C \u2229 X)| + |NY (C \u2229 Y )| + |S \u2229 A2 | \u2265 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2 + 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2 + |S \u2229 A2 |.\nThus, we have \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nSubcase 2.3. There are exactly three subgraphs, say X, Y , Z, in A1 .\nWe assume, without loss of generality, that |C \u2229 X| \u2265 2 by the fact that |C| \u2265 4. We have\n|F \u2229 X| \u2265 |NX (C \u2229 X)| \u2265 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2. Since every vertex of Bni has exactly one neighbor\noutside of this subgraph, and every pair of S \u2229 X, S \u2229 Y , S \u2229 Z, S \u2229 A2 are disjoint, we have\nS = (S \u2229 X) \u222a (S \u2229 Y ) \u222a (S \u2229 Z) \u222a (S \u2229 A2 ) \u2287 NX (C \u2229 X) \u222a (S \u2229 Y ) \u222a (S \u2229 Z) \u222a S \u2229 A2 .\nThen we have\n|S| \u2265 |NX (C \u2229X)|+|S\u2229Y |+|S\u2229Z|+|S\u2229A2 | \u2265 2(n\u22122)\u22122+(n\u22122)+(n\u22122)+|S\u2229A2 | \u2265 4n\u221210.\nThus, we have \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + |S| \u2265 4n \u2212 10.\nBy Lemma 6 and 7, we have\nTheorem 1. The conditional diagnosability of bubble sort graph Bn under the PMC model\nis tc (Bn ) = 4n \u2212 11 (n \u2265 5).\n\u0003\nTheorem 2. The conditional diagnosability of bubble sort graph B4 under the PMC model\nis tc (B4 ) = 5.\nProof. Let F1 , F2 be two distinguishable fault-sets in B4 . Denote S = F1 \u2229F2 and C \u2282 F1 \u2206F2\nbe a connected component in B4 \u2212 S. By Lemma 4, we have |C| \u2265 4.\nIf |S| \u2265 4, then \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + \u2308S\u2309 \u2265 6. Now we suppose that |S| \u2264 3. In the worst case, B4 \u2212 S\nhas two components, one of which is an isolated vertex {u}, then we have C = B4 \u2212 S \u2212 {v},\nwhich implies |C| = 20. So, \u2308 |C|\n2 \u2309 + \u2308S\u2309 > 10. Thus tc (B4 ) \u2265 5, while tc (B4 ) \u2264 5, hence\ntc (B4 ) = 5.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe issue of identifying faulty processors is important for the design of multiprocessor interconnected systems, which are implementable with VLSI. The process of identifying all the\nfaulty processors is the system-level diagnosis. This paper establishes the conditional fault\ndiagnosability of the bubble sort graphs under the PMC model. The conditional diagnosability is about four times the traditional diagnosability under PMC model. This method can\nbe also applied to other complex network structure.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.B.
