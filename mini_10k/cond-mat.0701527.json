Much\nwork is devoted to homogeneous one-dimensional systems\nin which the entanglement entropy of L contiguous spins,\ndefined as the von Neumann entropy of the density matrix of the block, SL = \u2212Tr\u03c1L log2 \u03c1L , scales at the critical\npoint as:\nc\nSL = log2 L + k,\n(1)\n3\n\nit is natural to assume that the same scaling law holds\nfor the entanglement entropy as in the homogeneous system. On the contrary, for relevant perturbations the local\ncritical behavior at the block boundary is governed by a\nnew fixed point and consequently the scaling of the entanglement entropy is expected to be modified. Finally, for\nmarginal perturbations the local critical behavior is characterized by continuously varying local exponents, thus, also\nthe prefactor of the logarithmic entropy scaling is presumably a continuously varying function of the strength of the\ninhomogeneity.\nThis scenario has been checked [5] for a single defect\nwhere c is the central charge of the associated conformal\nlocated at the boundary of the block in the spinfield theory and k is a non-universal constant. In the vicin- coupling\n1\nity of the quantum critical point, L in Eq.(1) is replaced 2 XXZ chain defined by the Hamiltonian\nby the correlation length [1].\nN\nX\ny\nInhomogeneities of different kinds (localized or extended\nx\nz\nJi (Six Si+1\n+ Siy Si+1\n+ \u2206Siz Si+1\n),\n(2)\nHXXZ =\ndefects, quenched disorder, etc.) are able to modify the\ni=1\nlocal critical behavior of the system [4] and as a consequence, the scaling properties of SL in Eq.(1) can also be where the Si\u03b1 's (\u03b1 = x, y, z) are spin- 21 operators and\nchanged. We expect that in case of weak perturbations Ji = J for i 6= L and JL 6= J. Concerning the behavcaused by inhomogeneities the entropy scaling remains in- ior of the entanglement entropy, this type of perturbavariant or is modified depending on the stability of the tion is found to be irrelevant in the ferromagnetic domain\nlocal critical behavior at the boundary of the block. For (\u2206 < 0) and relevant in the antiferromagnetic (AF) doirrelevant perturbations the critical properties of the sys- main (\u2206 > 0) in complete agreement with the local critical\ntem at the boundary of the block remain unchanged and behavior of the system. More interestingly, the boundary\np-1\n\n\fF. Igl\u00f3i et al.\ndefect is a (truly) marginal perturbation in the XX chain continuous symmetry (XX and XXX models) and with\n(i.e. with \u2206 = 0), where the logarithmic scaling form in discrete symmetry (QIC) are considered.\nEq.

Contrary to random disorder, these\ncan be mapped to a system of free-fermions by means of\ntypes of perturbations may also be irrelevant or marginal.\nstandard techniques [30], we have performed large scale\nThe relevance of an aperiodic perturbation on the critnumerical calculations. Here, one determines first the reical behavior of a quantum chain is related to the sign\nstricted correlation matrix, GL\ni,j , i, j = 1, 2, . . .

According to a heuristic criterion [19] the permatrix [7] GL (GL )T , where (GL )T denotes the transpose\nturbation is relevant if \u03c6 > 0, marginal if \u03c6 = 0 and\nof GL . In this representation, the entanglement entropy\nirrelevant if \u03c6 < 0. Later aperiodic QIC-s [21\u201323] and\nis given as a sum of binary entropies of the non-correlated\nXX chains [24] were studied by an RG method and the\nfermionic modes [2, 31]:\nlow-energy properties were exactly calculated.

In the\nquantum chains, the couplings take two values, Ja = r and\nJb = 1, depending on the underlying letter. To check the\neffect of an irrelevant perturbation for the QIC, we have\ncalculated the size-dependence of the entropy for a strong\nmodulation, r = 0.01, and plotted the results in the inset\nof the upper panel of Fig.1. We can see that the entropy\nhas the same scaling form as in the homogeneous system\nwith a central charge, c = 0.500(1). Hence this value is\nfound indeed to be independent of the value of r.\nRepeating the same type of calculation for the Fibonacci\nXX model, the effective central charge is found to be r\ndependent, see the extrapolated values in the upper panel\nof Fig.1, which is in agreement with the marginal nature of\nthe perturbation for this system. ceff (r) is monotonously\ndecreasing with decreasing r < 1 and approaches a finite\nlimiting value at r = 0 with a correction of O(r2 ).\nWe have calculated limr\u21920 ceff (r) \u2261 ceff (0) for the XX\nFibonacci chain exactly by a variant of the strong disorder RG approach [12]. For details of the application of\nthe method, we refer to Refs. [26\u201329]. The basic idea is\nthat two spins coupled by a very strong bond, Jb , form a\nmaximally entangled singlet and the words aba and ababa\nare renormalized into the letters b\u2032 and a\u2032 , representing\nthe new effective couplings Jb\u2032 \u2248 \u03bar2 and Ja\u2032 \u2248 \u03ba2 r3 , respectively. For the XX model, the prefactor is \u03ba = 1. We\nnote that this renormalization step corresponds to the reversed triple application of the inflation transformation described earlier. The renormalized infinite chain is again a\nFibonacci chain with Ja\u2032 /Jb\u2032 = r, so that one can repeat the\ntransformation and finally the ground state of the system\n\nFibonacci XX chain as a function of the coupling ratio, r. In\nthe inset SL vs. log2 L is shown for the QIC at r = 0.01. Lower\npanel: the same for the tripling sequence.\n\nconsists of a set of singlet pairs. The entanglement entropy\nin this case is given by the number of singlet bonds connecting the block with the rest of the system [13]. The effective central charge can be determined by calculating the\ndifference \u2206S = SL \u2212 SL\u2032 between the averages of entanglement entropies belonging to blocks of length L = Fl+3\nand blocks of length L\u2032 = Fl . In order to do this, we\n\u221a notice that L/L\u2032 = \u03c1 = \u03c4 3 for large l, where \u03c4 = (1 + 5)/2\nis the golden-mean ratio. The ratio of the length of the\nrenormalized letters is \u03bb(a\u2032 )/\u03bb(b\u2032 ) = \u03c4 and the ratio of\nthe density of the letters is given by \u03bc(a\u2032 )/\u03bc(b\u2032 ) = \u03c4 , thus\nthe singlet bonds represented by letter b\u2032 , cover a fraction\nncov = 1/(\u03c4 2 + 1) of the chain. In this way, we obtain\n\u2206S =\n\nceff (0)\nlog2 \u03c1 = 2ncov ,\n3\n\n(5)\n\nand ceff (0) = 2/[(\u03c4 2 + 1) log2 \u03c4 ] = 0.7962 which is in excellent agreement with the numerical findings (see the arrow\nin the upper panel of Fig.1). A more detailed derivation\nof ceff based on the distribution of singlet lengths in the\ninfinite system can be found in Ref. [32].\nFor the XXX-chain the Fibonacci modulation is a relevant perturbation and the fixed point at r = 0 is strongly\nattractive. Indeed, the RG-procedure described for the\nXX-model leads to the same form of renormalized couplings but with a prefactor \u03ba = 1/2, thus the ratio\nJa\u2032 /Jb\u2032 = r/2 < Ja /Jb tends to zero even for a finite starting value of r. Consequently, the effective central charge is\nthat given in Eq.(5) and it is independent of the coupling\nratio r (provided r 6= 1).\nTripling modulation. \u2013 The next sequence we consider is a tripling sequence, which is (for small perturbations) marginal both for the QIC and for the XX\nmodel (\u03bd = 1, \u03c9 = 0) and relevant for the XXX model\n(\u03bd = 2/3, \u03c9 = 0). This sequence consists of three dif-\n\np-3\n\n\fF. Igl\u00f3i et al.\nferent letters, a, b and c and is defined by the inflation\nrule: a \u2192 aba, b \u2192 cbc and c \u2192 abc. In the following, we consider Jb > Jc > Ja and use the parameterization: Jc /Jb = Ja /Jc = r. For the QIC, the sizedependence of the entropy for r = 0.01 is shown in the\ninset of the lower panel of Fig.1, which is characterized\nby a central charge ceff = 0.560(5). For the XX model,\nthe shift in the effective central charge is even greater,\nsee the extrapolated values in the lower panel of Fig.1.\nSurprisingly, this type of inhomogeneity enhances the entanglement as opposed to random and single defect perturbations in these models. We mention that in some\nspecial chains of spins with many components also random disorder can enhance entanglement [33]. In the XX\ncase, we have also calculated the small r limiting behavior by the RG method, in which singlets form over the\nJb bonds and the new letters are defined by the deflation\nrules. The new couplings satisfy the marginality condition: Jc\u2032 /Jb\u2032 = Ja\u2032 /Jc\u2032 = r and in the aperiodic singlet\nground state we have \u03c1 = 3 and ncov = 1/3, such that we\nobtain from Eq.(5): ceff (0) = 2/ log2 3 = 1.262 (see the\narrow in the lower panel of Fig.1). For the XXX chain,\nthe tripling perturbation plays a special role: a weak perturbation at r = 1 is relevant but it is marginal at r = 0,\nwhere the same type of condition: Jb\u2032 /Jc\u2032 = Jc\u2032 /Ja\u2032 = r\nholds as for the XX chain. Consequently, the effective\ncentral charge of the tripling XXX chain is expected to be\na continuously varying function of r at least for small r\nbut discontinuous at r = 1. We note that the Fibonacci\nand the tripling XX (and XXX) chains belong to a class of\naperiodic chains for which the ground state is an aperiodic\nsinglet state in the limit r \u2192 0 and the average entropy\ncan be exactly calculated [32].\n\ntion step consists of two parts. In the first part, all strong\nJb bonds are eliminated and two-site clusters with an effective field, h\u0303 \u2248 h2c /Jb = r\u22122/3 , are created. In the second part, all the strong transverse fields with hc = 1 are\neliminated and new couplings J \u0303a \u2248 Ja3 /h2c = r\u22121 are created. Identifying J \u0303b with Ja = r\u22121/3 we have an aperiodic sequence \u00e3b\u0303b\u0303\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3b\u0303b\u0303\u00e3b\u0303b\u0303 . . . which is in a period doubling form in terms of a\u2032 \u2261 \u00e3 and b\u2032 \u2261 b\u0303b\u0303. During further renormalization steps the structure of this chain remains invariant. To calculate the entanglement entropy,\nwe consider a chain with N = 4n sites, in which there is\na strong bond at L = N/2. By eliminating this bond, an\neffective cluster is formed, which connects the block with\nthe rest of the system, such that in the limit 1/r \u2192 0\nSL (N ) = 1 and ceff (0) = 0 in accordance with the numerical results presented in Fig.2. In the free-fermion\nrepresentation, this result follows from Eq.(4) in which\nthere is only one mixed non-correlated fermionic mode in\nthe subsystem with a non-zero eigenvalue \u03bb1 = 1/2 (i.e.\n\u03bbl = 0, for l = 2, 3, . . . L). The perturbative correction\nto this term for 1/r \u226a 1 can be estimated as follows.\nFor n = 2, i.e. for N = 16, we obtain the sequence\n\u00e3b\u0303b\u0303\u00e3 after the first RG step, while by eliminating the two\nstrong b\u0303 bonds in the second RG step, a super-cluster is\nformed over the boundary of the block. The entanglement\ncontribution due to this super-cluster is calculated perturbatively leading to a new mixed fermionic mode with\nnon-zero eigenvalue: \u03bb2 = r\u22122/3 /16. For n = 3, i.e. for\nN = 64, three RG steps can be performed, which results\nin a new super-super-cluster and a new mixed mode, so\nthat there are then two non-zero sub-leading eigenvalues:\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = r\u22122/3 /16. For a general n, we then have\nn embedded clusters and there are n \u2212 1 non-zero subleading eigenvalues: \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = . . . = \u03bbn = r\u22122/3 /16.\nPeriod doubling modulation. \u2013 In the rest of the The entanglement entropy for small 1/r indeed scales with\npaper, we focus on marginally non-periodic QIC-s for n \u2212 1 = log2 N/2 \u2212 1 and the effective central charge is\nwhich even the first correction to the entanglement en- given by: ceff (r) = r\u22122/3 (log2 r/8 + const).

Saturation of the entropy is\nfound also at L = N/4 and L = N/8 and expected to\nhold for any L = N/2p , p = 1, 2, . . ., since at these special positions there are very small couplings, which act\nin the infinite system as an effective cut. Repeating the\ncalculation with a block of size L = [N/3]int , where [y]int\ndenotes the integer part of y, we obtain the usual logarithmic dependence as can be seen in Fig.2. In this case ceff (r)\nis found to be a continuously varying function of r (see\nthe extrapolated values in the inset of Fig.2). We have\nthus the surprising conclusion that the scaling function\nS\u0303(x = L/N ) = limN \u2192\u221e SL (N )/ log2 N is non-analytic at\nx = 2\u2212p , p = 1, 2, . . ., in contrast to the behavior in homogeneous systems [1].\n\nSL(N)\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\nr=0.2, L/N=1/3\nr=1.25, L/N=1/2\nr=1.0, L/N=1/2\nr=0.8, L/N=1/2\n2\n\n4\n\nceff(r)\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0\n0\n6\nlog2N\n\n1\n\nr\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 2: Size dependence of the entanglement entropy of the\nhierarchical QIC for three different values r at L/N = 1/2 and\nfor r = 0.2 at L/N = 1/3.

As for the period doubling modulation, we eliminate the strongest bonds, which are at odd\npositions (i.e. with n = 0), and create renormalized twospin clusters subjected to an effective transverse field of\nh\u0303 \u2248 h2c /J = r. The renormalized chain has now N/2 sites\nwith the same hierarchical structure of couplings. In the\nrepeated use of the transformation, bonds with n = 1\n(then with n = 2, etc) are decimated out and superclusters with a hierarchical structure are created. Then for\nany value of L, the block is connected to the environment\nthrough one super-cluster, thus the entanglement entropy\nis SL = 1 and ceff (0) = 0 in accordance with the results\npresented in the inset of Fig.2. This result can also be derived using the free-fermion representation of the system,\nwhen in the limit r \u2192 0, the density matrices of the non-\n\ncorrelated fermionic modes have eigenvalues (\u03bbi , 1 \u2212 \u03bbi )\ngiven by \u03bb1 = 1/2 and \u03bbl = 0, for l = 2, 3, . . . L, thus\nSL = 1.\nFor a small but finite r, there are perturbative corrections, which depend on the value of L. In the simplest case\nL = 3, these corrections are due to correlations between\nthe spin-clusters (1, 2) and (3, 4). In the non-correlated\nfree-fermionic description, the eigenvalues are up to O(r2 ):\n\u03bb1 = 1/2 + O(r2 ), \u03bb2 = r2 /4 and \u03bbl = 0, for l = 3, . . . L.\nFor L = 5 there are two perturbative cluster-cluster contributions which will result in \u03bb2 = 2r2 /4, whereas the\nother eigenvalues remain unchanged, at least up to O(r2 ).\nGenerally, for L\u03ba = 2\u03ba + 1, \u03ba = 0, 1, . . . there are \u03ba perturbative contributions and in the limit \u03bar2 \u226a 1 we have\n\u03bb2 = \u03bar2 /4. (cf. the form of perturbative cluster correction in the case of the period doubling sequence.) Thus\nwe obtain for the entanglement entropy:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\nS2\u03ba +1 = 1 + \u03bar2 \u2212 log2 (\u03bar2 ) + +\n+ O(\u03ba2 r4 )\n4\n2 4 ln 2\n(7)\nFor a general value of L = 2n (2m + 1), the number of\nindependent perturbative (cluster) contributions, \u03ba, does\nnot depend on n and given by \u03ba = [log2 m]int + 1. In\nthis case the entanglement entropy in the leading order is\ngiven in Eq.(7). We thus conclude, that SL (r) has logperiodic oscillations in L and the leading L dependence\nis faster than logarithmic in the range (log2 L)r2 \u226a 1,\nalthough for (log2 L)r2 \u226b 1, a logarithmic L dependence\nis expected.\nSummary. \u2013 Summing up, we have studied the entanglement properties of critical quantum spin chains,\nsuch as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XX models, as well as the quantum Ising chain in the presence of\naperiodic modulations of the couplings. As far as the critical properties of the systems are concerned, an aperiodic\ninhomogeneity can be irrelevant, marginal or relevant, depending on the model and on the fluctuation properties\nof the aperiodic sequence. An irrelevant aperiodicity alters neither the logarithmic scaling of the entropy nor the\nconstant in front of the logarithm, i.e. the growth of the\nentropy is determined by the central charge c of the pure\nsystem. For marginal and relevant modulations, the average entropy is still scaling logarithmically with the size\nof the block, however, the prefactor is modified compared\nto that of the homogeneous system i.e. ceff 6= c and in\naddition to this, log-periodic oscillations appear. Interestingly, ceff can exceed the corresponding value in the\nhomogeneous system and for marginal perturbations, it\nis a continuous function of the coupling ratio r. In the\nr \u2192 0 limit, where the ground state of several aperiodic\nsequences can be exactly constructed, the average effective\ncentral charge was analytically calculated.\n\np-5\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThis work has been supported by the National Office of\n\n\fF.
