INTRODUCTION\nMultiferroics represent an appealing class of functional materials that exhibit different ferroic\ninteractions simultaneously. The coexistence of several interactions, particularly existence of a crosscoupling between the magnetic and electric interactions, termed as magnetoelectric (ME) coupling, brings\nabout novel physical phenomena and offer possibilities for new device functions [1-3]. BiFeO3 (BF) is one\nof the most extensively studied multiferroic material in recent years [2-6] and it is the only material known\nto exhibit magnetic order (TN= 643 K) and ferroelectric order (ferroelectric transition temperature TcFE=\n1103 K) at room temperature. At 300 K, It has a rhombohedral structure with space group R3c, which\npermits coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity. It shows G-Type antiferromagnetic spin\nconfiguration along [001]h direction with a long range (periodicity ~ 620 \u00c5) cycloidal spin structure\nincommensurate with the lattice along [110]h direction of the hexagonal unit cell of the rhombohedral\nstructure below magnetic ordering temperature. It also exhibits a very weak magnetoelectric coupling [7,8]\ndue to cycloidal spin modulation which thought to be the reason for suppressed linear magnetoelectric\ncoupling. Theoretical calculations [9] predict that a large difference between the transition temperatures TcFE\nand TN causes weak ME coupling in BF. In addition to this, BF also has other shortcomings like its\nsemiconducting behavior at T \uf0b3 300 K, which does not allow electric poling and causes high dielectric losses\nin the sample at room temperature. Due to this, it is difficult to measure the ferroelectric properties of BF at\nand above room temperatures and limits its applications in devices. Thus the main aim of researchers in the\nfield has been (i) to improve the dielectric properties of BF/ modified BF and (ii) to bring ferroelectric\ntransition (TcFE) and magnetic transition (TN) temperatures in the modified BF compositions closer to each\nother; thus achieving an enhancement of ME coupling.\nThe incommensurate cycloidal spin structure can be suppressed with application of (a) magnetic\nfield, (b) strain and probably (c) chemical substitution too [1-3].\n\nIn 1996, Sosnowska et al. [10]\n\ndemonstrated that the La doping at A-site in BiFeO3 destroys the space modulated spin structure (SMSS)\nand allows the measurement of linear ME effect. In 2006, Zhang et al [11] reported enhancement of\nmagnetic and ferroelectric properties for La substituted BF. In addition to this, various workers have shown\nthat La substitution decreases the ferroelectric transition temperature in materials belonging to perovskite\nfamily [12]. In 2005, Wang et al. [13] reported an enhancement of magnetoelectric properties in the (1-x)\nBiFeO3-(x) PbTiO3 (BF-PT) solid solutions and also claimed destruction of space modulated spin structure\nin them, due to addition of PbTiO3. Using detailed powder x-ray diffraction studies, Zhu et al. [14] proposed\nphase diagram for the solid solution of (1-x) BiFeO3-(x) PbTiO3(BF-PT). Their results reveal the existence\nof a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in this system, in which rhombohedral (x\u22640.20), orthorhombic\n(0.20 \u2264x\u22640.28) and tetragonal (x\u22650.31) phases exist with a large tetragonality in the tetragonal phase region.\nIn the MPB region, they reported the simultaneous existence of orthorhombic, tetragonal and rhombohedral\nphases. It is important to note that they ruled out the presence of monoclinic phase at morphotropic phase\n2\n\n\fboundary region. They also pointed out that in BF-PT solid solutions, compositions with BF:PT ratio around\n50:50 favors the formation of chemically ordered microregions in which spiral spin modulation of BF is not\nonly disturbed but completely disappears and may give rise to weak ferromagnetic state. Further, Cheng et\nal. [15] reported that tetragonality of BF-PT solid solution decreases as concentration of the La3+ ions\nincreases (for x< 0.3). They suggest (but without any experimental evidence), that further increase of La\ncontent in BF-PT matrix may stabilize rhombohedral (R3c) phase. They also reported improved magnetic\nproperties in (BF1\u2212x\u2013LFx)\u2013(PT) system at MPB (45:55). Recently, detailed studies on the effect of further\nincreasing La content in (BF0.50\u2013LF0.50)0.50\u2013(PT)0.50 (BF-LF-PT) has been investigated by the authors [16].\nOur studies on La rich BF-LF-PT solid solution revealed that large grains (~7\u03bcm) could be obtained by\noptimizing the processing parameters, and the sample properties were significantly improved. The sample\nshowed improved spontaneous polarization, magnetization and magnetoelectric coupling. The dopants help\nin bringing the ferroelectric and magnetic transition temperatures closer to each other; a condition favored\nfor technological applications of the materials.\nHowever, the complex mechanism of origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) and magnetization in\nLa rich BF-LF-PT still needs to be understood and requires further probing. Some open questions that\nrequire further explanations are: (a) the observation of large dielectric constant and ferroelectric hysteresis\n(P-E) loop in the sample is contradictory to the observation of centrosymmetric cubic crystal structure with\nspace group Pm3m, (b) the true polarization behavior of the sample needs to be understood to explain (i) the\nobserved frequency dependent broad transitions with large dielectric constant near TcFE (ii) large remnant\npolarization observed in P-E loops, and (c) a non saturating magnetic (M-H) hysteresis loop observed at\nroom temperature could not establish the existence of long-range magnetic order in this La rich BF-LF-PT\nsystem[16] .\nIn this paper, we present the results of powder diffraction (temperature dependent neutron\ndiffraction, rotating anode powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature) in conjunction with detailed\nimpedance spectroscopy (dielectric spectroscopy, ac conductivity measurements). The results observed from\nthese measurements would be used to clarify first two issues ((a) and (b)) addressed above. The goal of\nimpedance spectroscopy investigation is to improve our understanding of these La rich BF-LF-PT properties\nby analyzing the electrical response of the grain and grain boundary effects, making an interpretation of the\nmicroscopic process. However, the powder x-ray and neutron diffraction study helps to assign correct crystal\nstructure of the system. Neutron diffraction offers certain unique advantages over x-rays, especially in the\naccurate determination of light elements like oxygen positions. It provides information about subtle changes\nin structure associated with the oxygen atoms and accompanying phase transitions that are crucial for\nresolving the above mentioned existing controversies/ issues. The observation of an anomaly at 170 K, in the\ntemperature dependence of lattice parameters, magnetization and polarization vs. temperature is taken as\nevidence of multiferroics magnetoelectric coupling. Magnetodielectric measurements (10 K\u2264T\u2264300 K)\nfinally prove that the sample starts exhibiting magnetoelectric coupling in this temperature range at ~170 K.\n3\n\n\fII. EXPERIMENT\n(a) Sample preparation and characterization\nSolid solutions are prepared using a conventional solid state reaction route as described elsewhere\n[16]. Powder X-ray diffraction studies were carried out using 12kW rotating Cu anode based Rigaku\npowder diffractometer operating in the Bragg-Brentano focusing geometry. Data were collected in the\ncontinuous scan mode at a scan speed of 1 degree per minute and step interval of 0.02 degree. The powder\nneutron diffraction data were recorded in the 2\uf071 range of 7\u00b0\u2013138\u00b0 at a step width of 0.05\u00b0 using neutrons of\nwavelength of 1.249 \u00c5 on a medium resolution powder diffractometer in the Dhruva Reactor at Bhabha\nAtomic Research Centre. The structural refinements were performed using the Rietveld refinement program\nFULLPROF [17]. A Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt with Axial divergence asymmetry function was\nused to model the peak profiles. The background was fitted using a sixth order polynomial. Except for the\noccupancy parameters of the atoms, which were fixed corresponding to the nominal composition, all other\nparameters, i.e., scale factor, zero displacement, isotropic profile parameters, lattice parameters, isotropic\nthermal parameters and positional coordinates, were refined.\nThe impedance (Z), phase angle (\uf06a), capacitance, dielectric loss (tan \u03b4), and ac conductivity were\nmeasured in the frequency range 102\u2264 f \u2264 107 Hz using an HP4192A impedance analyzer. The temperature\ndependent impedance measurements were carried out at an interval of 10 K in the range 473 K to 573 K and\nthe temperature was controlled with an accuracy of \u00b11K using a temperature controller. The low temperature\n(5 K \u2264 T \u2264 250 K) dc and ac magnetic measurements were carried out using SQUID magnetometer (MPMSXL7). While, low temperature dielectric constant (\uf065\u2032) and magneto-dielectric constant vs. temperature\nmeasurements were carried out using LCR meter and a cryogen free low temperature high magnetic field\nfacility.\n(b) Data Analysis\nThe real (Z\u201f) and imaginary (Z\") parts of the complex impedance (Z*) were calculated from the\nmeasured data using following relations.\n\nZ \uf0a2 \uf03d Z * cos\uf028\uf06a \uf029\n\n(1)\n\nZ \uf0a2\uf0a2 \uf03d Z * sin\uf028\uf06a \uf029\n\n(2)\n\nWhere complex impedance is given by the relation\n\nZ* \uf03d Z \uf0a2 \uf02b iZ \uf0a2\uf0a2\n\n(3)\n\nThe real (\u03b5\u2032) and imaginary (\u03b5\u2032\u2032) parts of dielectric constant are calculated using following relations:\n\n\uf065\uf0a2 \uf03d\n\nC .t\n\uf0650 A\n\n\uf065 \uf0a2\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf065 \uf0a2 \uf028 tan \uf064 \uf029\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n4\n\n\fWhere C = measured capacitance, t= thickness of sample, \u03b50 = permittivity of free space, A = cross\nsectional area of electrode surface and tan \u03b4 = dielectric loss.\n\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Structural analysis: A powder x-ray and neutron diffraction studies\nFigure 1 (a) depicts the Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction patterns of BF-LF-PT\nsystem at room temperature using cubic symmetry and with space group Pm3m and all the peaks can be\nindexed. But, the presence of ferroelectric hysteresis loop [16] contradicts the observation and suggests noncentrosymmetric nature of crystal structure at ambient conditions. The intensity of the superlattice reflection\nresulting from octahedral tilts depends on the small changes in the position of oxygen atoms only. The x-ray\nscattering form factor for oxygen is rather small, and if the tilt angles are small, the superlattice reflections\nwill have too low an intensity to be visible above the background count level. Thus, the non-observation of\nsuperlattice reflections in a powder x-ray diffraction pattern may lead to misinterpretation. In view of this,\nwe re-visited the crystal structure for the BF-LF-PT system using powder neutron diffraction technique.\nTo check the correctness of structure, first, we refined powder neutron data using cubic symmetry\n(space group Pm3m) as shown in Figure 1(b). It is evident from the figure that all the peaks of powder\nneutron diffraction data cannot be indexed. The origin of these additional Braggs peaks may be either\nnuclear (structure) or magnetic (in case of antiferromagnetic). The presence of additional Braggs peaks with\nwell defined intensity at high angles clearly ruled out the possibility of only magnetic origin and clearly\nsuggests that the cubic structure is incorrect. It is important to bring to notice that presence of superlattice\nreflection around ~ 38 degree is observed even in powder x-ray diffraction data [when data was collected in\nstep scan mode and shown in inset of figure 1(a)]. These observations confirm the nuclear origin of\nadditional Braggs peaks and non-centrosymmetric structure for BF-LF-PT. In view of the observation of\nferroelectric hysteresis loop at room temperature, we also refine powder neutron diffraction data using\ndifferent classical perovskite space groups that exhibit ferroelectric properties, like tetragonal P4mm,\northorhombic B2mm, rhombohedral R3m and monoclinic Cm or Pm; none of these space groups account the\nadditional Braggs peaks (also termed as superlattice reflections).\nThe Miller indices of the superlattice reflections based on a doubled pseudo-cubic cell carry\ninformation about the nature of the octahedral tilts in the structure. Superlattice reflections with all-odd\nintegered indices (\"odd-odd-odd\" i.e., \"ooo\" type) and two-odd and one-even integered indices result from\nanti-phase (\u2212 tilt) and in-phase (+ tilt) tilting of the adjacent oxygen octahedra due to structural phase\ntransitions driven by softening and freezing of the phonons at R (q= 1\u20442 1\u20442 1\u20442 ) and M (q= 1\u20442 1\u20442 0) points of the\ncubic Brillouin zone, respectively [18]. The ferroelectric instabilities in perovskite are associated with \uf047\npoint. The superlattice reflection observed by us in powder x-ray diffraction has odd-odd-odd type (i.e. 311)\nintegred indices, when indexed with respect to doubled pseudo-cubic cell and confirms the R point\n5\n\n\finstabilities. The onset of ferroelectric polarization transforms under Pm 3 m as the components of the\n\uf0474\uf02d irreducible representation (IR). Anti-phase tilting of oxygen octahedra transforms under Pm3m as the\n\ncomponents of the R4\uf02b IR. Using the software package \"ISOTROPY 2000 [19]\" to couple \uf0474\uf02d and R4\uf02b IRs, we\nobtained many space groups. We find that the rhombohedral structure with space group R3c accounted all\nthe reflection at room temperature. In the space group R3c, for the description of the crystal structure, we\nused the following hexagonal axes: ah=bp\u2212cp, bh=cp\u2212ap and ch=2ap+2bp +2cp. The hexagonal unit cell\ncontains 6 formula units, while the true unit cell in the primitive rhombohedral contains 2 formula units. The\nasymmetric unit of the structure consists of Bi/Pb/La atom at the 6a site at (0,0,1/4+w), Fe/Ti atom at the 6a\nsite at (0,0,0+w), and O atom at the 18b site at (1/6 +u,1/3+v,1/12). The fit between the observed and\ncalculated profiles is quite satisfactory and include the weak superlattice reflections (see Fig 1(c)).\nFigure 2 depicts the evolution of powder neutron diffraction patterns of the sample with temperature\nin the range of 25\u2013300 K for the two-theta range 10 to 80 degree. It is evident from this figure, in addition to\nsuperlattice peak, one additional peak around 2\uf071= 15.58 degree (similar to BF) appears below 200 K and its\nintensity increases with deceasing temperature and suggests that magnetic origin. Variation of the integrated\nintensity for the one of strong magnetic reflection (at 2\uf071 \u224815.58 degree) and superlattice reflection (at 2\uf071\n\u224830.25) as a function of temperature are shown in figure 3 and show change of slope around 200 K. The\nother interesting feature noted after Rietveld refinements is that the calculated equivalent lattice parameters\n(Fig.4(a)), volume (Fig.4(b)), tilt angle (Fig.4(c)), and calculated polarization (Fig.4(d)) as a function of\ntemperature, indicate a change between 150 K-200 K, suggesting some structural anomaly in this\ntemperature range.\nIn the next sections we discuss the results of impedance spectroscopy and ac conductivity behavior\nof the sample, to understand the origin of frequency dependent broad transitions observed in this sample and\nlarge remnant polarization values.\n\nB. Relaxation Mechanism\n(1) Impedance Spectroscopy\nImpedance spectroscopy is a well known tool for detecting the dielectric relaxation processes in a\npolycrystalline sample. It involves the application of an alternating voltage signal to a sample and\nmeasurement of phase shifted current response. It is established that the complex impedance spectroscopy is\na powerful tool to analyze the relationship between microstructure and properties. Using impedance\nspectroscopy one can distinguish between intrinsic (grain), extrinsic (grain boundaries) and sample electrode\ninterface contributions to observed properties of the sample. An equivalent circuit based on impedance\nspectra gives an insight into the physical process occurring inside the sample.\nFigures 5(a) and 5 (b) show the variations of the real (Z\u2032) and imaginary parts (Z\u2032\u2032) of impedance as a\nfunction of frequency at different temperatures (473K\u2264T\u2264573K). Two clear broad peaks are observed in\nboth Z\u2032 and Z\u2032\u2032 profiles and the intensity of these peaks in both profiles are seen to decrease with increasing\n6\n\n\ftemperature. As is evident in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) both peaks shift towards higher frequencies with rise in\ntemperature; first peak at ~103 Hz for 473 K data shifts to ~105 Hz at 573 K whereas, the second peak\nobserved at ~106 Hz for 473 K data is seen to shift to ~107 Hz at 573 K.\nThe activation energy associated with both relaxation processes are determined by fitting (see\nFig.5(c)) the Arrhenius equation in temperature range (473K \u2264T\u2264 573K) using the relation\n\n\uf0e6 \uf02d Ea\n\uf0e8 k BT\n\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf074 0 exp \uf0e7\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7,\n\uf0f8\n\n\uf074\uf03d\n\n1\n\n(6)\n\n2\uf070 f p\n\nwhere \uf074 0 is the prefactor, Ea is the activation energy for relaxation process and kB is Boltzamnn\nconstant. The fitting parameters thus obtained are \uf074 0 (grain) = 4.2\u00d710-13s, Ea (grain)=0.596eV, \u03b70 (grain\nboundary)= 4.21\u00d710-15s and Ea(grain boundary)=1.013eV.\nFigure 5(d) shows Nyquist plots (Z\"vs.Z') at all temperatures (473K\u2264T\u2264573K) having two semi\ncircle arcs (see inset of 5(d)). In Nyquist plots, these semi circle arcs represent different relaxation processes.\nUsually semi circle at lower frequency represents grain boundary relaxation process and the one at higher\nfrequencies gives the information on grain relaxation. It is evident from Nyquist plots that both grain and\ngrain boundaries are contributing to the physical properties of this polycrystalline sample. However, it is\nobserved that the centers of these semicircles arcs are below the real impedance axes.\n\nThe complex\n\nimpedance can be represented by Cole- Cole equation.\n\nRg\nZ* =\n\n\uf061g\n\n1 \uf02b ( j\uf077Rg C g )\n\n\uf02b\n\nRgb\n(7)\n\n\uf061 gb\n\n1 \uf02b ( j\uf077RgbC gb )\n\nWhere Z* = Complex Impedance, Rg= Grain Resistance, Rgb= Grain Boundary Resistance, Cg= Grain\nResistance, Cgb= Grain Boundary Resistance, \u03b6g = relaxation time distributed function for grain, \u03b6gb =\nrelaxation time distributed function for grain boundary. \"j\" and \u03c9 have their usual meanings. In this equation\nthe relaxation time distributed function \u201e\u03b1\u201f is given by the relation \" \uf071 \uf03d\n\n\uf061\uf070\n2\n\n\". The value of \u201e\u03b1\u201f varies from\n\nzero to unity; for pure Debye process the value for \u201e\u03b1\u201f should be unity. Thus \u201e\u03b1\u201f is a measure of deviation of\nrelaxation process from the ideal Debye behavior. The values of depression angle (\u03b8) (angle between the real\nimpedance axes and the centre of semicircle arc) vary in the range (~9 \u030a-19 \u030a) and calculated \u201e\u03b1\u201f values\n(~0.10-0.35) indicate that both grain and grain boundary relaxation processes are non Debye type. In order\nto account for non-Debye behavior, a well established approach [20] of replacing the specific capacitance\n\u201eC\u201f by a phenomenological constant phase element (CPE) was used. The impedance of CPE is given\nby Z CPE \uf03d\n\n1\n, where \u03b2 < 1. The Nyquist plots are well fitted with R-CPE model (shown in Fig.6 (a))\n( j\uf077 ) CPE\n\uf062\n\nboth for grain and grain boundaries. A representative plot and equivalent circuit fitting are shown in Fig\n7\n\n\f6(b). The fitting parameters R, C and \u03b2 both for grain (Rg, Cg, \u03b2g) and grain boundaries (Rgb, Cgb, \u03b2gb) are\nobtained and variation of these parameters with temperature is shown in Figs 6(e), (f) and (g). The grain\nboundaries in this sample are found to be more capacitive and resistive than the grains. Activation energies\ndetermined by fitting these resistance values (grain and grain boundaries) in Arrhenius equation (Fig 6(e))\nare in agreement with the Ea values obtained from relaxation time Arrhenius fit. The values of parameter \u03b2\n(see Fig.6 (g)) once again confirm that both relaxation processes are non Debye type. The lower activation\nenergy for grains confirms that the grains are more conducting than the grain boundaries, as is clearly\nevident from the equivalent circuit fitting.\n(2) Dielectric Spectroscopy\nThe variation of real (\u03b5') and imaginary (\u03b5\") parts of dielectric constant as a function of frequency\n(102Hz\u2264f\u2264107Hz) at different temperatures (473K\u2264T\u2264573K) are shown in Figs. 7(a) and (b). At lower\nfrequencies both \u03b5' and \u03b5\" have large values that decrease with increase in frequency. In dielectric materials\nthe coexistence of low dielectric constant regions with high dielectric constant region can influence the\npiling of charges at the interface and result in Maxwell-Wagner (M-W) polarization [21]. Catalan et al.\n[22,23] reported the onset of Maxwell-Wagner polarization at lower frequencies in ferroelectric super\nlattices. The impedance spectroscopy results clearly validate the existence of less resistive and capacitive\ngrains and highly resistive and capacitive grain boundaries in the sample that may result in dielectric\ninhomogeneity, resulting in M-W polarization in our sample. We fit Maxwell-Wagner model to \u03b5\" vs.\nfrequency profile (see Fig. 7(c)) using following relations [23].\n\n1 \uf02d \uf077 2\uf074 gb\uf074 g \uf02b \uf077 2\uf074 (\uf074 gb \uf02b \uf074 g )\n1\n\uf065 \uf0a2\uf0a2 \uf028\uf077 \uf029 \uf03d\n1 \uf02b \uf077 2\uf074 2\n\uf077C0 \uf028 Rgb \uf02b Rg \uf029\n\n(8)\n\nwhere subindex \u201eg\u201f and \u201egb\u201f refer to grain and grain boundary respectively.\n\n\uf074 g \uf03d C g Rg , \uf074 gb \uf03d Rgb C gb , \uf074 \uf03d\n\n\uf074 gb Rg \uf02b \uf074 g Rgb\nRg \uf02b Rgb\n\n, C0 \uf03d \uf065 0\n\nA\nt\n\n(9)\n\nUp to ~105 Hz frequencies the Maxwell-Wagner model fits very well with observed data implying\nthat at lower frequencies the large dielectric values are due to Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization. At\nhigher frequencies, where space charge polarization is known to be absent \u03b5\u2032\u2032 values show deviation from the\nmodel.\n3. Electric conduction Mechanism\nThe ac conductivity response with frequency was also studied in the sample, to confirm the\nMaxwell-Wagner polarization at lower frequencies (<105 Hz). Frequency dependent ac conductivity (\u03b6ac)\nwas measured in the range 102Hz\u2264f\u2264105Hz at temperatures ranging from 473K to 573K and the results are\nshown in the Figs. 8 (a) and (b). Temperature range is typically chosen in the vicinity of dielectric anomaly.\nA plateau, or a frequency independent behavior of ac conductivity at lower frequencies indicate the\ndominance of\n\ndc conductivity to conduction mechanism and the absence of hopping charge carrier\n8\n\n\fpolarization in this frequency range. The frequency dependence is analyzed by using \"Jonscher\u201fs Universal\nPower Law\" given by the relation [24]\n\n\uf073 ac \uf03d \uf073 dc \uf02b A\uf077 n\nwhere \u03b6dc is dc conductivity at particular temperature, A is a temperature dependent constant and n is\nthe power law exponent which generally varies between 0 and 1 depending upon temperature. The exponent\nn represents the degree of interaction between mobile ions with lattice around them (n=1 represents noninteracting Debye system and with decreasing n, interaction between mobile ions and lattice is expected to\nincrease). Pre-factor A gives the strength of polarizibility. The universal power law fits well up to ~105 Hz\nfrequency at all temperatures (see Figs. 8(a) and (b)) and fitting parameters \u03b60, A, and n are thus obtained.\nThe variations of the pre factor A and exponent n as a function of temperature are shown in Figs. 8(c)\nand 8(d). Pre-factor A shows a peak around ~500 K, beyond which the values of \u201eA\u201f decreases drastically.\nThe exponent n shows a minimum exactly around this temperature. There are anomalies in \u201eA\u201f and \u201en\u201f are\nthus observed in the vicinity of dielectric anomaly.\n\nIV DISCUSSION\nThe presence of superlattice reflections in powder x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns\nunambiguously show that the crystal structure is not centrosymmetric cubic (with space group Pm3m) but\nnon-centrosymmetric rhombohedral (space group R3c) at room temperature, which is consistent with the\nobserved ferroelectricity [16] in the sample. In addition to this, we also observed the anomalies in the lattice\nparameters, tilt angle, calculated polarization, volume, and integrated intensity of superlattice and magnetic\nreflection as a function of temperature around 170K.\nThe spontaneous polarization value (~16 \u03bcC/cm2) as calculated from unit cell refinement, was found\nto be much lower than the values of polarization (~61\u03bcC/cm2) earlier reported by the authors [16] at room\ntemperature. However, the extrapolation of spontaneous polarization (Ps) vs. temperature curve (Fig.3(d))\nshows that Ps vanishes at ~523K, which is also the peak temperature (TcFE ) in dielectric response of the\nsample. The polarizibility factor A obtained as a fitting parameter of frequency dependent ac conductivity\ncurves, also shows a maximum around this temperature. All these factors clearly confirm a ferroelectric\nphase transition at around this temperature. The cause of such enhanced dielectric constant values at TcFE\nand large remnant polarization values, as observed in the sample, (and also usually reported [21-23] in this\nfield of research), are analytically argued using the detailed data analyses of dielectric measurements,\nimpedance spectroscopy and ac conductivity measurements in the temperature range 473 K\u2264 T \u2264573 K.\nImpedance spectroscopy in the range of 473K\u2264T\u2264573K, gives a clear picture of presence of two types\n(grains and grain boundaries) of relaxation processes in this sample. The suppressed semicircle arcs in\nNyquist plots indicate that the relaxation processes for both grain and grain boundaries are non-Debye type.\nThis means that there is heterogeneity in the sample and sample has a distribution of relaxation times around\na mean relaxation time \u03b7m. The equivalent circuit fitting for Nyquist plots with R-CPE model also confirms\n9\n\n\fthe non Debye relaxation processes present in the sample. The fitting parameters Rg, Rgb, Cg and Cgb as\nobtained from Nyquist plots show that in this sample the grain boundaries are more capacitive and resistive\nas compared to the grains. The estimated activation energy (Ea) obtained by Arrhenius fittings of mean\nrelaxation times and resistances, indicate that the conduction process in grains is easier than that in grain\nboundaries.\nThe sample can be modeled as consisting of two regions (grains and grain boundaries) of different\ndielectric constants and conductivities, represented closely by Maxwell-Wagner model. The \u03b5 \u030b vs. frequency\nprofiles fit very well up to ~105 Hz, verifying Maxwell-Wagner polarization in the sample (See Fig. 7(c)).\nThe conducting grains and highly insulated grain boundaries result in piling of charge at interfaces, giving\nrise to large dielectric and polarization values in the frequency range up to ~105 Hz. The parameters used for\nthe fitting of Maxwell-Wagner model are in agreement with the equivalent circuit fitting parameters of\nNyquist plots. Obviously, the origin of the frequency dependent broad transitions (relaxor-like) in\ntemperature range 473K\u2264T\u2264573K, and large dielectric constant values and large remnant polarization are\nargued to be the artifact of Maxwell Wagner polarization.\nWe also show that the dc conductivity dominates the conduction mechanism in the sample at lower\nfrequencies and conduction due to hopping charge carriers is ruled out in this frequency range, giving full\nsupport to the Maxwell-Wagner polarization up to ~105 Hz.\nAnother important offshoot of this work is the evidence of M-E coupling in this La rich BF-LF-PT\nsample starting from T\u2265170 K. As shown in Fig. 3 all the calculated parameters of the sample including the\ncalculated polarization from the temperature dependent neutron diffraction data showed a distinct change in\nthe temperature range 150 \u2013 200 K, suggesting the existence of some kind of structural anomaly in this\nsample around this temperature. Low temperature dielectric constant (\uf065\u2032) vs. temperature (10 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K)\nprofile was measured and analyzed specifically to identify any change in dielectric constant (\uf065\u2032) in this\ntemperature range (~150 K-200 K). A slope change in dielectric constant (\uf065\u2032) vs. temperature profile in this\ntemperature range is clearly evident in Fig.9(a). Interestingly both dc magnetization (M) and\n\nac\n\nsusceptibility measurements (\u03c7\") vs. temperature profiles preformed at 3Hz and 999Hz, in the lowtemperature region show a slope change around same temperature (Figs.9(b) & (c)). Such slope changes in\nmagnetization in BF-PT samples at low temperatures have been identified in literature [14] as Neel\ntemperature TN. However, the neutron diffraction data reported in this work clearly links these slope changes\nwith a structural anomaly present in this BiFeO3 (BF) based solid solution.\nThe results of Magnetodielectric measurements in the temperature range 10 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K at 10 5 Hz\nare shown in Fig. 10 Such high frequency is used to avoid the artifacts of Maxwell-Wagner Polarization. It\nis observed that although below 170 K the data in zero field and in field (3T) overlap completely, above 170\nK an enhancement of dielectric constant (\uf065\u2032) on application of magnetic field continues up to 300 K. Room\ntemperature multiferroic behavior in this sample has already been reported by authors [16]. We thus\n\n10\n\n\fconclude that M-E coupling in this La rich BF-LF-PT sample is observed in the temperature range 170 K \u2264\nT \u2264 300 K.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, the presence of superlattice reflection in powder diffraction patterns confirm the\nnoncubic structure of La modify BF-PT. Detailed Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction data reveals\nthat it has ferroelectric rhombohedral crystal structure with space group R3c at the room temperature. The\ncontradiction observed between the calculated spontaneous polarization (from temperature dependent\nneutron diffraction data) and measured remnant polarization values with the enhancement of dielectric\nconstant values at Tc can be understood on the basis of Maxwell\u2013Wagner model. The sample can be\nmodeled as consisting of two regions (grains and grain boundaries) of different dielectric constants and\nconductivities, represented closely by Maxwell-Wagner model. Both grain and grain boundaries show non\nDebye relaxation behavior. A substantial evidence of magnetoelectric coupling in the sample is established\nin the temperature range (170 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\nThe authors would like to acknowledge SQUID National Facility at IIT Delhi (Funded by\nDepartment of Science and Technology (DST), India) for magnetic measurements.
