Di\u001berent sorting s enarios provide estimates for evolutionary distan e and\n\nan help explain the di\u001beren es in gene orders between two spe ies (see [9\u2104 for\n\nexample). Initially, the shortest sequen es (parsimonious) of reversals were sought, and polynomial\ntime algorithms to \u001cnd su h sequen es were des ribed ([13, 8, 18\u2104). Re ently, biologi ally motivated\nre\u001cnements have been\n\nonsidered, spe i\u001c ally a\n\nounting for groups of genes that are\n\nwith the di\u001berent homologous genes (genes having a single\ndi\u001berent spe ies. These groups are likely together in the\n\no-lo alized\n\nommon an estor) in the genomes of\n\nommon an estral genome, and were not\n\ndisrupted during evolution, hen e, we expe t them to appear together at every step of the evolution.\nIn terms of our\nthat is, a\n\nombinatorial model, a group of\n\no-lo alized genes is modeled by a\n\nommon interval,\n\nolle tion of sequential numbers that are not broken by any reversal move. This\n\nleads us ba k to the basi\n\nalgorithmi\n\nonstraint\n\nproblem:\n\nWhat is the smallest number of reversals required to sort a signed permutation into the\nidentity permutation without breaking any (subset of )\nThese s enarios are\n\nalled\n\nperfe t\n\nommon interval?\n\n[11\u2104. Be ause of the additional\n\nonstraint, it is possible that\n\nthe smallest perfe t sorting s enario is longer that the smallest s enario.\nAlready it is known that this re\u001cned problem is NP-hard [11\u2104. However, several authors have\ngiven sub-instan es whi h\n\nan be solved in polynomial time [3, 4, 10\u2104, and \u001cxed parameter tra table\n\nalgorithms exist [4, 5\u2104.
