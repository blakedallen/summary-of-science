IRAS 23365+3604\nIRAS 23365+3604 (\u03b1 =23h 39m 01.s 7, \u03b4 =36\u25e6 21\u2032 14\u2032\u2032 ), hereafter IRAS 2336, is an advanced\nmerger at a distance of 252 Mpc (1 mas\u22480.8 pc) with a very high luminosity (log(LFIR /L\u2299 ) =\n12.13) which corresponds to a CCSN rate of \u2248 5 SN/year [1].\n\n2. Observations and their analysis\nWe present multi-epoch, -frequency EVN observations of the ULIRG IRAS 2336 (see Figure\n1). Putative young radio SNe with typical peak luminosities of L\u223c1027\u221228 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 should\nhave a flux of 0.01 to 0.1 mJy at the distance of IRAS 2336. The imaging process and therefore the\nanalysis of the observations has proved to be a very challenging task due to:\n\u2022 The presence of strong extended emission (\u223c10 mJy, \u0398=0.\u2032\u2032 5) which hinders the detection of\ncompact sources (SNe).\n\u2022 The lack of short baselines, which make the imaging algorithm to fail (compare the images\nwe present here with the images we presented in the previous EVN Symposium [2]).\nThe extended emission at the distance of IRAS 2336 cannot be resolved out with the available\nangular resolution, and the only way to properly map it is by having a good combination of short\nbaselines (which give enough information for closure phase) and/or using a combination of Gaussian model fitting and delta components. This can be done within the Caltech imaging programme\nDIFMAP [3], which we have used for the imaging process. We then exported the clean images\nback into AIPS to analyse them and to produce the final maps that we present here.\n\n3. Results\nOur images reveal the presence of a nuclear starburst with an approximate extension of 200 pc.\nWe note that at 18 cm, the size of the nuclear region is larger than at 6 cm, for all the epochs. This\ncan be explained by the longer lifetime of electrons at lower frequencies [4]. The high luminosities\nof the nuclear region (see Table 1) can only be explained by the presence of non-thermal emitters most likely SNe- within extended emission. In fact, the flattening (from the first to the third epoch)\nof the spectral index from the nuclear zone (see Figure 2) can be explained by the variation in\nflux of sources therein and/or appearance of new sources (SN) which would be seen first at higher\nfrequencies and later at lower frequencies [5]. We have also detected some sources at 18 cm with\nemission >5\u03c3 (L\u223c1027\u221228 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ) with no counterpart at 6 cm. These are candidates of\nCCSNe exploding in the circumnuclear region (see sources labelled as probable SNe in Figure 1).\n\n4. Conclusions\nThe EVN has aided to obtain the deepest and highest resolution radio images ever of one of the\nmost distant ULIRGs in the local Universe. High resolution is important, but the information provided by short baselines is also necessary to properly map the morphology of the diffuse emission\nin this kind of sources.\n2\n\n\fThree epochs of EVN observations towards IRAS 23365+3604\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 4996.490 MHZ IRAS2336C1.SHGEO.1\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 1664.490 MHZ IRAS2336L1.SHGEO.1\n\n250\n\n250\n\n250\n\nEP061C (11 Mar '08)\n\nEP061A (29 Feb '08)\n\n60 pc\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n-50\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n200\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\nCristina Romero-Ca\u00f1izales\n\n0\n-50\n\n50\n0\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\nprobable\nSN\n\n-150\n-200\n\nJb1,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr,Ur\n\nJb1,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr,Ur\n\n-250\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2599719 DEC 36 21 08.525652\nCont peak flux = 3.0777E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n100\n\n-200\n\n\u0398 = 26 x 38 mas at 46 deg\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2599719 DEC 36 21 08.525652\nCont peak flux = 7.9285E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n(a)\n\n-200\n\n-250\n200\n\n100\n\n(b)\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 4996.490 MHZ IRAS2336C2.SHGEO.1\n\n200\n\n200\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n150\n\n-50\n\nprobable\nSN\n\n150\n100\n\n0\n\nprobable\nSN\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-150\n\n-200\n\n60 pc\n\nEP064D (07 Mar '09)\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n250\n\n250\n\nEP064B (28 Feb '09)\n\n0\nMilliARC SEC\n\n(c)\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 1664.490 MHZ IRAS2336L2.SHGEO.1\n\n250\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-200\n\n-250\n200\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-200\n\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\n\n-200\n\n-200\n\nJb2,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr,Cm,Kn\n\nJb2,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr\n-250\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2599719 DEC 36 21 08.525652\nCont peak flux = 3.2027E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n100\n\n-200\n\n\u0398 = 26 x 38 mas at 46 deg\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2599719 DEC 36 21 08.525652\nCont peak flux = 4.8077E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n(d)\n\n-200\n\n-250\n200\n\n100\n\n(e)\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 4990.490 MHZ IRAS2336C3.SHGEO.1\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n100\nMilliARC SEC\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n200\n\n-50\n\n-200\n\n60 pc\n\nEP064J (08 Mar '10)\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n250\n\n250\n\nEP064L (20 Mar '10)\n\n0\nMilliARC SEC\n\n(f)\n\nCONT: IRAS2336 IPOL 1658.490 MHZ IRAS2336L3.SHGEO.1\n\n250\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-200\n\n-250\n200\n\nprobable\nSN\n\n0\n-50\n\n50\n0\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-200\n\nprobable\nSN\n\n-150\n\n-200\n\nJb1,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr,Ur,Cm,Kn\n\nJb1,Ef,Wb,On,Mc,Nt,Tr,Ur,Cm,Kn,Ys\n-250\n\n-200\n\n\u0398 = 26 x 38 mas at 46 deg\n\n-250\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2603973 DEC 36 21 08.525988\nCont peak flux = 8.6628E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n(g)\n\n-200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 23 39 01.2603973 DEC 36 21 08.525988\nCont peak flux = 6.3384E-04 JY/BEAM\n\n(h)\n\n-200\n\n-250\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-100\n\n-200\n\n(i)\n\nFigure 1: IRAS 2336 at 6 cm (left), 18 cm (middle) and 18 cm contours overlaid on grey scale 6 cm images (right), in\nthree different epochs (top to bottom): March 2008, February 2009 and March 2010.

Sources labelled as probable SN in Figures (b), (e)\nand (h), are > 5\u03c3 detections and have inferred luminosities \u223c1027\u221228 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 .\n\n3\n\n\fThree epochs of EVN observations towards IRAS 23365+3604\n\nCristina Romero-Ca\u00f1izales\n\n3\n\n2.9\n\n\u03b1 = 0.2 \u00b1 0.3\n\nlog(Flux/\u03bcJy)\n\n2.8\n\n2.7\n\n\u03b1 = \u22121 \u00b1 0.3\n\n2.6\n\n\u03b1 = \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n2.2\n0.2\n\n1st epoch\n2nd epoch\n3rd epoch\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\nlog(Frequency/GHz)\n\nFigure 2: Spectral index (S \u223c \u03bd \u03b1 ) evolution of the peak component in the nuclear zone, which we expect to be\ncomposed by non-thermal sources (e.g. SNe).\n\nEpoch\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n\nL6 cm \u00d7 1028\npeak\n1.7 \u00b1 0.2\n1.8 \u00b1 0.2\n5.5 \u00b1 0.4\n\nerg s\u22121 Hz\u22121\ntotal\n1.7 \u00b1 0.2\n2.4 \u00b1 0.2\n7.2 \u00b1 0.4\n\nL18 cm \u00d7 1028\npeak\n5.5 \u00b1 0.4\n3.4 \u00b1 0.3\n4.6 \u00b1 0.3\n\nerg s\u22121 Hz\u22121\ntotal\n17.6 \u00b1 0.4\n18.9 \u00b1 0.3\n15.8 \u00b1 0.3\n\nTable 1: Peak and total luminosities of the nuclear zone at 6 cm and 18 cm in the three different epochs.\n\nReferences\n[1] Condon, J.
