of the continued fraction for values of quotients of power sums\n\narXiv:math/0401362v1 [math.NT] 26 Jan 2004\n\nP. Corvaja\n\nU. Zannier\n\nAbstract. Generalizing a result of Pourchet, we show that, if \u03b1, \u03b2 are power sums over Q satisfying suitable necessary assumptions, the length of the continued fraction for \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) tends\nto infinity as n \u2192 \u221e. This will be derived from a uniform Thue-type inequality for the rational\napproximations to the rational numbers \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n), n \u2208 N.\nIntroduction. The features of the continued fraction of a positive real number are usually extraordinarily difficult to predict. However, if the numbers in question run through certain parametrized\nfamilies, some regularity occasionally appears. For instance, we may recall remarkable\nresults by\np\nSchinzel [S1], [S2], on the lengths of the periods of the continued fractions for f (n), where f is\na polynomial with rational coefficients and n varies through N.\nIn a similar direction, but much more simply, one can deal with the continued fractions of\nthe rational numbers r(n), n \u2208 N, where now r \u2208 Q(X) is a rational function; for example, we\nmay now look at the length of the fraction: in [S2, Lemma 2], Schinzel proves that this length is\nbounded as a function of n (see also [M] for a more precise result). Substantially, the reason for\nthis is that r(X) has a finite expansion as a simple continued fraction with partial quotients in\nQ[X].(1)\nMore generally, one may inquire about the length of the continued fraction for the rational\nvalues of other arithmetical functions. In general, due to the lack of an Euclid's algorithm, we have\nnot a suitable \"functional continued fraction\"; this fact makes the situation different from the case\nof Q(X) and generally speaking considerably more difficult.\nFor certain exponential functions, we have a result by Y. Pourchet, answering an appealing\nquestion of Mend\u00e8s-France (see [M2, p. 214]); it states that, for coprime integers a, b > 1, the\nlength of the continued fraction for (a/b)n tends to infinity as n \u2192 \u221e, in marked contrast to the\nrational function case.\nThis theorem may be derived from the (deep) lower bound |(a/b)n \u2212 (p/q)| \u226b\u01eb q \u22122 exp(\u2212\u01ebn)\n(any positive \u01eb), where p, q are integers with 0 < q < bn (which follows e.g. from Ridout generalization of Roth's Theorem [R]). The estimate is in fact amply sufficient, since it implies that all the\npartial quotients of the continued fraction in question are \u226a\u01eb exp(\u01ebn), and the statement about\nthe length follows at once. (See also [Z, Ex. II.6].)\nIn this direction, one may consider more general power sums in place of an , bn . Namely, in\nanalogy to [CZ1] (where the notation is slightly different) we consider the ring (actually a domain)\nE made up of the functions on N of the form\n\u03b1(n) = c1 an1 + . . . + cr anr ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the coefficients ci are rational numbers, the ai are positive integers and the number r of\nsummands is unrestricted. (We shall often normalize (1) so that the ci are nonzero and the ai are\ndistinct; in this case the ai are called the \"roots\" of \u03b1.)\nWe then consider the ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 of nonzero elements of E and ask about the length of the\ncontinued fraction for the values \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) (provided \u03b2(n) 6= 0, which is the case for all large n).\nIt turns out (Corollary 2 below) that the length of the relevant continued fraction does not tend to\ninfinity if and only if \u03b1/\u03b2 admits an expansion as a (finite) continued fraction over E. Note that\nE is not euclidean, so in practice this condition \"rarely\" holds.\nThis result plainly generalizes Pourchet's, but now the Ridout Theorem seems no longer\nsufficient for a proof. In fact, we shall need the full force of the Schmidt Subspace Theorem,\n(1)\n\nObserve however that such continued fraction specialized at X = n may not coincide with the\ncontinued fraction for r(n).\n1\n\n\fsimilarly to [CZ1], where (among others) the related question of the integrality of the values\n\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) was investigated.\nSimilarly to the above sketched argument for Pourchet's Theorem, the conclusions about the\ncontinued fraction will be derived from a \"Thue-type\" inequality for the rational approximations\nto the values in question, which is the content of the Theorem below. Its proof follows [CZ1] in\nthe main lines, except for a few technical points; however the present new simple applications of\nthose principles are perhaps not entirely free of interest.\nPreliminary to the statements, we introduce a little more notation.\nWe let EQ be the domain of the functions of type (1), but allowing the ai to be positive\nrationals. If \u03b1 \u2208 EQ is written in the form (1), with nonzero ci and distinct ai , we set l(\u03b1) =\nmax(a1 , . . . , ar ), agreeing that l(0) = 0.\nIt is immediate to check that l(\u03b1\u03b2) = l(\u03b1)l(\u03b2), l(\u03b1 + \u03b2) \u2264 max(l(\u03b1), l(\u03b2)) and that l(\u03b1)n \u226b\n|\u03b1(n)| \u226b l(\u03b1)n for n \u2208 N tending to infinity (so in particular, \u03b1(n) cannot vanish infinitely often\nif \u03b1 6= 0).\nTheorem. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E be nonzero and assume that for all \u03b6 \u2208 E, l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2) \u2265 l(\u03b2). Then there\nexist k = k(\u03b1, \u03b2) > 0 and Q = Q(\u03b1, \u03b2) > 1 with the following properties. Fix \u01eb > 0; then, for all\nbut finitely many n \u2208 N and for integers p, q, 0 < q < Qn , we have\n1\n\u03b1(n) p\n\u2265 k exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\u2212\n\u03b2(n) q\nq\nWe tacitly mean that the alluded finite set of exceptional integers includes those n \u2208 N with\n\u03b2(n) = 0; this finite set may depend on \u01eb.\nRemarks. (i) The assumption about \u03b1, \u03b2 expresses the lack of an \"Euclid division\" in E for \u03b1 : \u03b2\nand cannot be omitted. In fact, suppose that l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2) < l(\u03b2) for some \u03b6 \u2208 E. Then, the values\n\u03b6(n) have bounded denominator and verify |(\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n))\u2212 \u03b6(n)| \u226a exp(\u2212\u01eb0 n) for large n and some\npositive \u01eb0 independent of n, against the conclusion of the Theorem (with p/q = pn /qn = \u03b6(n)).\nNote that the assumption is automatic if l(\u03b1) \u2265 l(\u03b2) and l(\u03b2) does not divide l(\u03b1).\n(ii) By the short argument after Lemma 1 below, given \u03b1, \u03b2, one can test effectively whether\na \u03b6 \u2208 E such that l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2) < l(\u03b2) actually exist. Also, the proof will show that a suitable Q\nand \"exponent\" k may be computed. On the contrary, the finitely many exceptional n's cannot\nbe computed with the present method of proof.\n(iii) Naturally, the lower bound is not significant for q larger than l(\u03b2)n/(k\u22121) . So, some upper\nbound Qn for q is not really restrictive. (Also, since the dependence of k on \u03b1, \u03b2 is unspecified,\nand since l(\u03b2)1/(k\u22121) \u2192 1 as k \u2192 \u221e, it is immaterial here to specify a suitable Q in terms of k.)\nNote also that a lower bound \u226b Qn for the denominator of \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) follows, sharpening\n[CZ1, Thm. 1]; in this direction, see [BCZ], [CZ3, Remark 1] and [Z, Thm. IV.3] for stronger\nconclusions in certain special cases.\n(iv) Like for the proofs in [CZ1], the method yields analogous results for functions of the\nform (1), but where ai are any algebraic numbers subject to the sole (but crucial) restriction that\nthere exists a unique maximum among the absolute values |ai |. Using the (somewhat complicated)\nmethod of [CZ2], one may relax this condition, assuming only that not all the |ai | are equal. For\nthe sake of simplicity, we do not give the proofs of these results, which do not involve new ideas\ncompared to [CZ1], [CZ2] and the present paper, but only complication of detail.\n(v) The Theorem can be seen as a Thue-type inequality with moving targets (similarly to\n[C] or [V]). It seems an interesting, but difficult, problem, to obtain (under suitable necessary\nassumptions) the \"Roth's exponent\" k = 2, or even some exponent independent of \u03b1, \u03b2. (As\nrecalled above, this holds in the special cases of Pourchet's Theorem.)\nCorollary 1. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be as in the Theorem. Then the length of the continued fraction for\n\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) tends to infinity as n \u2192 \u221e.\n2\n\n\fThis corollary is in fact a lemma for the following result, which gives a more precise description.\nCorollary 2. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E be nonzero. Then the length of the continued fraction for \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) is\nbounded for infinitely many n \u2208 N if and only if there exist power sums \u03b60 , . . . , \u03b6k \u2208 E such that\nwe have the identical continued fraction expansion\n\u03b1(n)\n= [\u03b60 (n), \u03b61 (n), . . . , \u03b6k (n)].\n\u03b2(n)\nIf this is the case, the mentioned length is uniformly bounded for all n \u2208 N.\nIt will be pointed out how the condition on \u03b1/\u03b2 may be checked effectively.\nThe special case \u03b1(n) = an \u2212 1, \u03b2(n) = bn \u2212 1 appears as [Z, Ex. IV.12]. For completeness\nwe give here this application.\nCorollary 3. Let a, b be multiplicatively independent positive integers. Then the length of the\ncontinued fraction for (an \u2212 1)/(bn \u2212 1) tends to infinity with n.\nProofs. We start with the following very simple:\nLemma 1. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E be nonzero and let t be any positive number. Then there exists \u03b7 \u2208 EQ\nsuch that l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b2) < t. Such an \u03b7 may be computed in terms of \u03b1, \u03b2, t.\nProof. Write \u03b2(n) = cbn (1\u2212\u03b4(n)), where c \u2208 Q\u2217 , b = l(\u03b2) and where \u03b4 \u2208 EQ satisfies u := l(\u03b4) < 1.\nIn particular, we have |\u03b4(n)| \u226a un , so for a fixed integer R we have an approximation, for n \u2192 \u221e,\n\u03b1(n)\n\u03b1(n)\n=\n\u03b2(n)\ncbn\n\nR\nX\nr=0\n\nr\n\n\u03b4(n)\n\n!\n\n+O\n\n\u0012\u0012\n\nl(\u03b1)uR+1\nb\n\n\u0013n \u0013\n\n.\n\nChoose R so that uR < t/ul(\u03b1) and define \u03b7 by the first term on the right. Then \u03b7 \u2208 EQ and\n|\u03b1(n) \u2212 \u03b7(n)\u03b2(n)| \u226a (l(\u03b1)uR+1 )n . Therefore l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b2) \u2264 l(\u03b1)uR+1 < t, concluding the proof.\nWe note at once that this argument may be used to check the assumption for the Theorem. In\nfact, suppose l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2) < l(\u03b2) for a \u03b6 \u2208 E. Then, if \u03b7 is as in the lemma, with t = l(\u03b2), it follows\nthat l(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b6) < 1. Since \u03b7 may be constructed and since the \"roots\" of \u03b6 are positive integers\nby assumption, this inequality determines \u03b6 uniquely; namely, if a suitable \u03b6 exists, it is just the\n\"subsum\" of \u03b7 made up with the integer roots.\nTo go on, for the reader's convenience, we recall a version of Schmidt's Subspace Theorem\nsuitable for us; it is due to H.P. Schlickewei (see [Schm2, Thm.1E, p.178]).\nSubspace Theorem. Let S be a finite set of places of Q, including the infinite one and normalized\nin the usual way (i.e. |p|v = p\u22121 if v|p). For v \u2208 S let L0v , . . . , Lhv be h + 1 linearly independent\nlinear forms in h + 1 variables with rational coefficients and let \u03b4 > 0. Then the solutions x :=\n(x0 , . . . , xh ) \u2208 Zh+1 to the inequality\nh\nYY\n\n|Liv (x)|v \u2264 ||x||\u2212\u03b4\n\nv\u2208S i=0\n\nwhere ||x|| := max{|xi |}, are all contained in finitely many proper subspaces of Qh+1 .\nFor our last lemma we could invoke results by Evertse [E]; for completeness we give a short\nproof of the special case we need.\nLemma 2. Let \u03b6 \u2208 EQ and let D be the minimal positive integer such that Dn \u03b6(n) \u2208 E. Then,\nfor every \u01eb > 0 there are only finitely many n \u2208 N such that the denominator of \u03b6(n) is smaller\nthan Dn exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n3\n\n\fP\nProof. We may write Dn \u03b6(n) = hi=0 ui eni , where ui \u2208 Q\u2217 and ei are distinct positive integers\nwith (e0 , . . . , eh , D) = 1. Let S be the set of places of Q made up of the infinite one and of those\ndividing De0 * * * eh .\nP\nDefine the linear form L(X) := hi=0 ui Xi .\nFor each v \u2208 S we define linear forms Liv , i = 0, . . . , h, as follows. If v does not divide D\n(including v = \u221e), then we put simply Liv = Xi for i = 0, . . . , h. If v|D, then there exists j = jv\nsuch that |ej |v = 1; then we set Ljv = L and Liv = Xi for i 6= j. The forms Liv , i = 0, . . . , h, are\nplainly linearly independent for each fixed v \u2208 S.\nSuppose now that the conclusion does not hold, so for some positive \u01eb and for all n in an infinite\nset \u03a3 \u2282 N the denominator of \u03b6(n) is \u2264 Dn exp(\u2212\u01ebn). For n \u2208 \u03a3, put x = x(n) = (en0 , . . . , enh ).\nThen, for n \u2208 \u03a3, the numerator of Dn \u03b6(n) has a g.c.d. with Dn which is \u2265 exp(\u01ebn). In turn\nthis gives\nY\n|L(x(n))|v \u2264 exp(\u2212\u01ebn),\nn \u2208 \u03a3.\nv|D\n\nAlso, for n \u2208 \u03a3, we have\nh\nYY\n\nv\u2208S i=0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n|Liv (x)|v = \uf8ed\n\nY\n\nv|D\n\n\uf8f6\n\n|L(x)|v \uf8f8\n\nh\nYY\n\n|eni |v =\n\nv\u2208S i=0\n\nY\n\n|L(x)|v ,\n\nv|D\n\nwhere the first equality holds because |ejv |v = 1 for v|D and the second because the (inner) double\nproduct is 1 by the product formula. Hence\nh\nYY\n\n|Liv (x)|v \u2264 exp(\u2212\u01ebn),\n\nn \u2208 \u03a3.\n\nv\u2208S i=0\n\nSince however ||x(n)|| is bounded exponentially in n, we may apply the Subspace Theorem (with a\nsuitable positive \u03b4) and conclude that all the x(n), n \u2208 \u03a3, lie in a finite union of proper subspaces.\nBut e0 , . . . , eh are distinct positive integers, whence each subspace corresponds to at most finitely\nmany n, a contradiction which concludes the proof.\nProof of Theorem. Let \u03b7 be as in Lemma 1, with t = 1/9. Write\n\u03b7(n) = g1 (\n\ne1 n\neh\n) + . . . + gh ( )n ,\nd\nd\n\nwhere gi \u2208 Q\u2217 and where ei , d are positive integers with e1 > e2 > . . . > eh .\nWe define k := h + 3, Q = exp(1/k), and we assume that for some fixed \u01eb > 0 (which we may\ntake < 1/6, say) there exist infinitely many triples (n, p, q) of integers with 0 < q \u2264 Qn , n \u2192 \u221e\nand\n\u03b1(n) p\n1\n(2)\n\u2212\n\u2264 k exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\u03b2(n) q\nq\nWe shall eventually obtain a contradiction, which will prove what we want.\nWe proceed to define the data for an application of the Subspace Theorem. We let S be the\nfinite set of places of Q consisting of the infinite one and of all the places dividing de1 * * * eh .\nWe define linear forms in X0 , . . . , Xh as follows. For v 6= \u221e or for i 6= 0 we set simply\nLiv = Xi . We define the remaining form L0\u221e by\nL0\u221e (X) = X0 \u2212 g1 X1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 gh Xh .\nPlainly, for each v the forms Liv are independent. For a triple (n, p, q) as above we set\nx = x(n, p, q) = (pdn , qen1 , . . . , qenh ) \u2208 Zh+1\n4\n\n\fQ\nQh\nand we proceed to estimate\nv\u2208S\ni=0 |Liv (x)|v .\nQ\nQ\nQ the double product\nn\n|\n\u2264\nq.\nIn fact, we have v\u2208S |eni |v = 1 by the\nFor i 6= 0 we have v\u2208S |Liv (x)|v = v\u2208S |qe\nv\nQi\nproduct formula, since the ei are S-units; also, v\u2208S |q|v \u2264 |q|, since q is an integer.\nQ\n(x)| Q\nFurther, we have v\u2208S |L0v (x)|v = |L0\u221e\nv\u2208S |x0 |v . As before, we see that the inner\n|x0 |\nproduct is bounded by |p|, since dn is an S-unit.\nAlso, |L0\u221e (x)| = qdn |\u03b7(n)\u2212(p/q)|. Then, using (2) and |(\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n))\u2212\u03b7(n)| \u226a (t/l(\u03b2))n \u2264 tn ,\nwe obtain\n|L0\u221e (x)| \u226a qdn tn + qdn (q \u2212k exp(\u2212\u01ebn)).\nSince q k \u2264 Qkn = exp(n) and since t = 1/9 < exp(\u22121 \u2212 \u01eb), the first term on the right does not\nexceed the second one, whence\n|L0\u221e (x)| \u226a qdn (q \u2212k exp(\u2212\u01ebn)).\nCombining this with the previous bound we get\nY\n\n|L0v (x)|v \u226a qdn (q \u2212k exp(\u2212\u01ebn))|x0 |\u22121 |p| = q \u2212(k\u22121) exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\nv\u2208S\n\nFinally, for the double product this yields (since k > h + 1)\nh\nYY\n\n|Liv (x)|v \u226a q \u2212(k\u2212h\u22121) exp(\u2212\u01ebn) \u226a exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\nv\u2208S i=0\n\nNow, (2) entails |p| \u226a ql(\u03b1)n \u226a (Ql(\u03b1))n , whence ||x|| \u226a C n for some C independent of n. Hence\nthe double product is bounded by ||x||\u2212\u03b4 for some fixed positive \u03b4 and large enough n.\nThe Subspace Theorem then implies that all the vectors x in question are contained in a\ncertain finite union of proper subspaces of Qh+1 .\nIn particular, there exists a fixed subspace, say of equation z0 X0 \u2212 z1 X1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 zh Xh = 0,\ncontaining\nan infinity of the vectors in question. We cannot have z0 = 0, since this would entail\nPh\nn\nz\ne\n=\n0 for an infinity of n; in turn, the fact that the ei are distinct would imply zi = 0\ni\ni\ni=1\nfor all i, a contradiction. Therefore we may assume that z0 = 1, and we find that, for the n's\ncorresponding to the vectors in question,\nh\n\np X ei n\nzi ( ) = \u03b6(n),\n=\nq\nd\ni=1\n\n(3)\n\nsay, where \u03b6 \u2208 EQ . We now show that actually \u03b6 lies in E. Assume the contrary; then the minimal\npositive integer D so that Dn \u03b6(n) \u2208 E is \u2265 2. But then equation (3) together with Lemma 2 implies\nthat q \u226b 2n exp(\u2212\u01ebn). Since this would hold for infinitely many n, we would find Q \u2265 2 exp(\u2212\u01eb),\nwhence exp((1/k) + \u01eb) \u2265 2, a contradiction. (Recall that k \u2265 3, \u01eb < 1/6.)\nTherefore \u03b6 lies in E; using (3) to substitute in (2) for p/q we find that, for an infinity of n,\n\u03b1(n)\n\u2212 \u03b6(n) \u2264 exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\u03b2(n)\nIn particular, l((\u03b1/\u03b2) \u2212 \u03b6) < 1, whence l(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2) < l(\u03b2), contrary to the assumptions, concluding\nthe proof.\nProof of Corollary 1. For notation and basic facts about continued fractions we refer to [Schm1,\nCh. I] and let pr (n)/qr (n), r = 0, 1, . . ., be the (finite) sequence of convergents of the continued\nfraction for \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n), where we may assume that \u03b1(n) and \u03b2(n) are positive.\n5\n\n\fAs is well-known, pr (n), qr (n) are positive integers, q0 (n) = 1, and we have\n\u03b1(n) pr (n)\n1\n\u2212\n.\n\u2264\n\u03b2(n)\nqr (n)\nqr+1 (n)qr (n)\n\n(4)\n\nSuppose the conclusion false, so for some fixed R \u2208 N there is an infinite set \u03a3 \u2282 N such that for\nn \u2208 \u03a3 the continued fraction for \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n) has finite length R + 1 \u2265 1. By this we mean that\npR (n)/qR (n) = \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n).\nSince \u03b1, \u03b2 satisfy the assumptions for the Theorem, there exist Q > 1, k \u2265 2 as in that\nstatement.\nDefine now the sequence c0 , c1 , . . . by c0 = 0 and cr+1 = (k \u2212 1)cr + 1 and choose a positive\nnumber \u01eb < c\u22121\nR log Q, so exp(cR \u01eb) < Q; we proceed to show by induction on r = 0, . . . , R, that,\nfor large n \u2208 \u03a3,\nqr (n) \u2264 exp(cr \u01ebn).\n(5)\nWe have q0 (n) = 1, so (5) is true for r = 0; we shall now show that (if r \u2264 R \u2212 1), for large n, (5)\nimplies the same inequality with r + 1 in place of r.\nObserve first that, by construction, exp(cr \u01eb) \u2264 exp(cR \u01eb) < Q, whence qr (n) \u2264 exp(cr \u01ebn) < Qn\nfor large enough n \u2208 \u03a3. We may then apply the Theorem with p = pr (n), q = qr (n) and deduce\nthat for large n \u2208 \u03a3 we have\n\u03b1(n) pr (n)\n\u2265 qr (n)\u2212k exp(\u2212\u01ebn).\n\u2212\n\u03b2(n)\nqr (n)\nHence, combining with (4),\nqr+1 (n) \u2264 qr (n)k\u22121 exp(\u01ebn) \u2264 exp(((k \u2212 1)cr + 1)\u01ebn) = exp(cr+1 \u01ebn)\nby the inductive assumption and the definition of cr+1 . This induction proves (5) for r \u2264 R.\nFinally, by (5) with r = R, we have qR (n) \u2264 exp(cR \u01ebn) for large n \u2208 \u03a3, whence qR (n) < Qn ,\nsince exp(cR \u01eb) < Q by construction. But then the Theorem holds for p = pR (n), q = qR (n),\nleading in particular to 0 = |(\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n)) \u2212 (pR (n)/qR (n))| > 0, a contradiction which concludes\nthe argument.\nProof of Corollary 2. For convenience let us denote by \u03c8(x) the length of the continued fraction\nfor the rational number x.\nWe start with the hardest half of the proof; namely, assuming that \u03c8(\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n)) is bounded\nfor n in an infinite sequence \u03a3 \u2282 N, we prove that \u03b1/\u03b2 has a finite continued fraction over E.\nLet us argue by induction on l(\u03b1) + l(\u03b2), the result being trivial when this number is \u2264 2.\nSince |\u03c8(x)\u2212\u03c8(1/x)| \u2264 1, we may plainly assume l(\u03b1) \u2265 l(\u03b2). By our present assumption, the\nhypothesis of Corollary 1 cannot hold for \u03b1, \u03b2, so there exists \u03b6 \u2208 E such that, putting \u03b7 = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2,\nwe have l(\u03b7) < l(\u03b2). For large n, we have \u03b2(n) 6= 0 and\n\u03b1(n)\n\u03b7(n)\n=\n\u2212 \u03b6(n).\n\u03b2(n)\n\u03b2(n)\nSince \u03b6 \u2208 E, the rational numbers \u03b6(n), n \u2208 N, have a finite common denominator D > 0. We\nnow appeal to [S1, Thm. 1], which bounds \u03c8((p/q) \u2212 r) in terms of \u03c8(p/q), where r is a rational\nnumber with fixed denominator. Applying this with p/q = \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n), r = \u03b6(n) and noting\nthat \u03c8(\u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n)) is bounded by assumption for n \u2208 \u03a3, we immediately obtain that the numbers\n\u03c8(\u03b7(n)/\u03b2(n)) are also bounded for n \u2208 \u03a3. Since l(\u03b7)+l(\u03b2) < l(\u03b1)+l(\u03b2), the inductive assumption\nimplies the existence of a finite continued fraction expansion over E for \u03b7/\u03b2. In turn, this yields\nthe same for \u03b1/\u03b2, proving the conclusion.\nThe \"converse\" part of Corollary 2 is again immediate from [S1, Thm. 1].\n6\n\n\fLike for Corollary 1, the condition that \u03b1/\u03b2 admits a finite continued fraction over E may be\nchecked effectively. To verify this, observe first that, if \u03b1/\u03b2 admits a continued fraction over E as\nin the statement, then it also admits an expansion such that l(\u03b6i ) \u2265 1 for all i \u2265 1; this claim\nfollows at once from the continued fraction identity\n[A, c, B] = [A + c\u22121 , \u2212c(cB + 1)],\nwhich allows to absorb all possible \"constant\" partial quotients c.\nWith this proviso (but not otherwise) the continued fraction over E is unique (if it exists); its\nexistence may be checked e.g. by iterating the effective criterion for checking the assumption of\nthe Theorem (or of Corollary 1), as in the comments after Lemma 1.\nProof of Corollary 3. We could invoke Corollary 2, but it is perhaps simpler to argue directly, by\ninduction on a + b (the assertion being empty for a + b = 2). On exchanging a, b we may assume\nthat a > b > 1.\nNow, we may assume that a is divisible by b; in fact, if this does not hold, we plainly have\nl(an \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b6(bn \u2212 1)) \u2265 a > b for any \u03b6 \u2208 E; in turn, we may then apply (a fortiori) Corollary 1 to\n\u03b1(n) = an \u2212 1, \u03b2(n) = bn \u2212 1, yielding the present assertion.\nWrite then a = bc, where c is a positive integer < a. Note that b, c are multiplicatively\nindependent (since a, b are such) whence the continued fraction for (cn \u2212 1)/(bn \u2212 1) has length\ntending to infinity, by the inductive assumption. But then the identity\nan \u2212 1\ncn \u2212 1\nn\n=\nc\n+\nbn \u2212 1\nbn \u2212 1\nimmediately implies the sought conclusion.\nFinal remarks. (a) It seems a very difficult problem to quantify the corollaries, namely to prove\nan explicit lower bound for the length of the relevant continued fractions. Even in the special case\nof Pourchet's Theorem, this seems to be related with an explicit version of Ridout's (or Roth's)\nTheorem, which presently appears inaccessible.\n(b) The methods of proof probably lead to results similar to the Theorem, where \u03b1(n)/\u03b2(n)\nis replaced by some algebraic function of a power sum, like e.g. the d-th root \u03b1(n)1/d . The pattern\nshould combine the arguments from, say, [CZ1, Cor. 1] (or [CZ4, Thm. 2]) with the above ones.\nIn case d = 2 it is perhaps possible to obtain corollaries similar to the present one, but in the\ndirection of Schinzel's mentioned papers; namely, under suitable\np assumptions on the power-sum\n\u03b1 \u2208 EQ , the length of the period of the continued fraction for \u03b1(n) tends to infinity with n.\n\nReferences.\n\n[BCZ] - Y.
