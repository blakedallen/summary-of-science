INTRODUCTION\n\nThe state of knowledge on planetary systems has undergone a major revolution over the past 14 years. Starting with the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a\nnormal, hydrogen-burning star in 1995 (Mayor & Queloz\n1995), the sample of known exoplanets has rapidly expanded from a sample of one to 320 individual planets\nresiding in 276 planetary systems2 . The majority of these\nplanets were detected by either Doppler techniques or\nby photometric transit surveys, and therefore have wellcharacterized orbits with system parameters amenable\nto uniform statistical analyses (Butler et al. 2006b;\nTorres et al. 2008). Additional planets have been discovered using gravitational microlensing and a handful of\nplanets have even been directly imaged (Beaulieu et al.\n2006; Gaudi et al. 2008; Kalas et al. 2008; Marois et al.\n2008). The occurrence rates, orbital properties, and\nphysical characteristics of these worlds inform our understanding of the formation and orbital evolution of planets\nin general, and the origin of our Solar System in particular.\n2. PLANET OCCURRENCE\n\nThe search for exoplanets began with a humble and\nancient question: do planets exist around other stars.\nHints initially emerged with the detection of Kuiper Beltlike dust disks around young stars such as Vega and \u03b2\nPic (Aumann et al. 1984; Smith & Terrile 1984), the radial velocity (RV) detection of progressively smaller substellar companions (Latham et al. 1989), and the discovery of \"pulsar planets\" (Wolszczan & Frail 1992). Since\nthen, the study of planet occurrence has evolved from a\nquestion of existence to a full-fledged statistical study of\nhundreds of systems. Where planets are found and their\nrelative frequencies around stars of various types provide\nvaluable insights into the planet formation process and\nguide future planet search efforts.\nDoppler surveys of thousands of stars have shown that\namong the Sun-like, FGK stars in the solar neighborElectronic address: johnjohn@ifa.hawaii.edu\n1 Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI\n96822; NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow\n2 http://exoplanets.org and http://exoplanet.eu\n\nFig. 1.- Top: Distribution of Doppler-detected exoplanets as\na function of semimajor axis. 10% of stars have planets within 5\nAU (Cumming et al. 2008). Middle and Bottom: The occurrence\nrate of planets rises as a function of metallicity (Fischer & Valenti\n2005) and stellar mass (Johnson et al. 2007a).\n\nhood, roughly one in ten harbors an giant planet with\na period P < 2000 days and a minimum mass greater\nthan half the mass of Jupiter (MP sin i > 0.5 MJup ;\nCumming et al. 2008). The distribution of detectable\nplanets as a function of semimajor axis, dN/d log a, is\nroughly flat out to 1 AU, and then rises toward \u223c 4.5 AU,\na cutoff corresponding the decade-long time baselines of\n\n\f2\nthe Doppler-based planet searches (Figure 1). Careful\nextrapolation to larger semimajor axes indicates that\n17-19% of stars harbor a giant planet within 20 AU\n(Cumming et al. 2008), and the planets discovered by direct imaging suggest that planets exist out to semimajor\naxes of hundreds of AU (Kalas et al. 2008; Chiang et al.\n2008; Veras et al. 2009).\nAdditional insight has been gained by studying planet\noccurrence as a function of stellar properties. The properties of stars are closely related to the properties of\nthe circumstellar environment during the early epoch of\nplanet formation. Planet host stars therefore represent\nan important link between the systems detected today\nand the processes of planet formation that took place in\nthe past.\nFor example, studies of the chemical compositions\nof planet-host stars reveals a strong correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence (Gonzalez\n1997; Santos et al. 2004; Fischer & Valenti 2005). The\nprobability of a star having a detectable planet rises\nfrom roughly 3% around stars with solar iron abundance ([Fe/H] = 0), to > 15% for stars with [Fe/H] >\n+0.25 (Figure 1; Fischer & Valenti 2005). The planetmetallicity correlation is currently best understood in\nthe context of the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which planets are formed through the collisional\nbuildup of refractory material in the protoplanetary disk\n(Pollack et al. 1996; Ida & Lin 2004). A higher stellar\nmetallicity observed today is a reflection of the higher\ndust content of the disk while planets were forming.\nMass is another stellar property closely related to\nthe surface density of solids in the disk midplane, and\nthe core accretion model predicts that planet frequency\nshould correlate with stellar mass (Laughlin et al. 2004;\nIda & Lin 2005; Kennedy & Kenyon 2008). This prediction has been confirmed by Doppler surveys of stars at\neither end of the mass scale (Figure 1). At the low\u2013mass\nend, only 4 out of \u2248 300 M dwarfs in various Doppler\nsurveys have been found to host a Jupiter-mass planet\n(Marcy et al. 1998; Butler et al. 2006a; Johnson et al.\n2007a; Bailey et al. 2008). At the other end of the scale,\nstudies of evolved, intermediat-mass stars (1.5 < M\u2217 .\n3 M\u2299 ) on the subgiant and giant branches (Reffert et al.\n2006; Sato et al. 2007; Niedzielski et al. 2007) have revealed an enhanced planet occurrence rate around highmass stars, rising from < 2% around M dwarfs, to approximately 9% around F and A stars (Lovis & Mayor\n2007; Johnson et al. 2007a).\nThe correlation between planet occurrence and stellar\nproperties not only informs theories of planet formation,\nbut also guides the target selection of future planet\nsearches. The increased \"planeticity\" of metal-rich\nstars has been harnessed by several metallicity-biased\nplanet searches to find large numbers of short-period\nplanets around nearby (d . 200 pc) stars (Laughlin\n2000; Fischer et al. 2005; da Silva et al. 2006). The\ncorrelation between stellar mass and planet occurrence\nwill be an important consideration for the target selection of current and future direct-imaging planet search\nmissions. Indeed, the first imaged planet candidates\nwere discovered around the \u223c 2 M\u2299 A-type dwarfs\nFomalhaut, HR 8799 and \u03b2 Pic (Kalas et al. 2008;\nMarois et al. 2008; Lagrange et al. 2009).\n\n3. THE OBSERVED PHYSICAL AND ORBITAL\nPROPERTIES OF EXOPLANETS\n\nDoppler surveys have uncovered a wealth of information about the orbital characteristics of exoplanets. Giant planets around other stars have a wide range of semimajor axes and orbital eccentricities (Udry et al. 2003;\nButler et al. 2006b). In contrast to the nearly circular\norbits of the Solar System gas giants, the orbits of exoplanets range from circular to comet-like, spanning the\nrange 0 \u2264 e \u2264 0.93, with a median eccentricity of 0.24\nfor a > 0.1 AU (Figure 2). The observed eccentricity\ndistribution is currently best reproduced by simulations\nof dynamical interactions among multiple planets immediately following the dissipation of the protoplanetary\ngas disk (Juri\u0107 & Tremaine 2008; Chatterjee et al. 2008;\nFord & Rasio 2008, however, see references therein for\nalternative models.).\n\nFig. 2.- Upper: Distribution of minimum masses (MP sin i) for\nall Doppler-detected planets. The dashed line shows the best fitting\npower-law. Lower: Eccentricity distribution of Doppler-detected\nplanets for P < 10 days (shaded) and P > 10 days (unshaded).\n\nThe distribution of exoplanet minimum masses,\nMP sin i, is well fit by the power-law relationship\ndMP /dN \u221d MP\u22121.4 (Figure 2), indicating that smaller\nplanets form more readily than massive \"super-Jupiters\"\nand brown dwarfs.\nThe paucity of planets with\nMP sin i > 10 MJup is known as the \"brown dwarf\ndesert,\" and high-contrast imaging surveys show that\ncompanions in this mass range are rare even out to\n\n\f3\nlarge semimajor axes (McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004;\nGrether & Lineweaver 2006). However, there are indications that the most massive Jovian planets with\nMP sin i & 2 MJup and wide orbits (a > 1 AU) are more\nprevalent around massive stars (Lovis & Mayor 2007;\nJohnson et al. 2007b; Sato et al. 2008).\nDoppler surveys have shown that 1.2% of stars have\nplanets with orbital periods P < 10 days, corresponding\nto a . 0.1 AU (Marcy et al. 2005). These short-period\nplanets are commonly referred to as \"hot Jupiters,\" and\nthey likely did not form in situ due to the high temperatures and low surface densities of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Instead, hot Jupiters and other closein planets most likely formed beyond the \"ice line\" at a\nfew AU, and then migrate inward to their present locations (Lin et al. 1996; Trilling et al. 1998). The process\nof inward migration is now thought to be a ubiquitous\nand integral feature of how planets form (Alibert et al.\n2005).\n\nFig. 3.- Transit observations of the exoplanet HAT-P-1b,\nwhich was discovered by the HAT-Net wide\u2013field transit survey\n(Bakos et al. 2007). The planet has a mass MP = 0.53 MJup , and\nan orbital period P = 4.465 days. Upper: A composite transit\nlight curve constructed from 7 individual photometric data sets\n(Winn et al. 2007). The photometry was phased by subtracting\nthe mid-transit time from each light curve. The best-fitting model\ngives a planet radius RP = 1.225 \u00b1 0.056RJ up Lower: Phased radial velocity measurements made during three transits, illustrating\nthe Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. The shape of the RM waveform yields the projected spin-obit angle. The HAT-P-1 planetary\nsystem is well aligned with a spin-orbit angle of 3.7 \u00b1 2.1 degrees\n(Johnson et al. 2008).\n\nPlanets with orbits that are serendipitously viewed\nedge\u2013on transit their host stars and provide valuable\nadditional information about the physical and orbital\ncharacteristics that cannot be studied by Doppler techniques alone (Charbonneau et al. 2005; Winn 2008).\nThe sample of known exoplanets includes 52 examples of well-characterized transiting systems. While\nthe brightest examples (V < 8) come from photometric follow-up of Doppler-detected planets (Henry et al.\n2000; Charbonneau et al. 2000; Bouchy et al. 2005),\nthe majority of transiting planets were detected by\nwide-field, photometric surveys (Konacki et al. 2003;\nAlonso et al. 2004; Bakos et al. 2007; Cameron et al.\n\n2007; McCullough et al. 2006). By monitoring hundreds\nof thousands of stars per night using networks of smallaperture, wide-field cameras, these surveys have uncovered a diverse collection of short-period planets with a\nwide range of masses, radii and orbital configurations\n(Southworth 2008; Torres et al. 2008).\nThe orbit solution of Doppler-detected planets yields\nthe minimum mass of the planet, MP sin i, but the light\ncurve of a transiting planet yields a direct measure of\nthe planet's inclination, providing an absolute measure\nof the planet's mass, assuming the stellar mass is known\nby other means. The depth of the photometric dip\nis related to the planet's radius (upper panel of Figure 3). The mass and radius together give the mean\ndensity, which can be compared to theoretical models\nof planetary interiors to provide a glimpse of their interior structures (Sato et al. 2005; Laughlin et al. 2005).\nModeling efforts of this type have revealed that enhanced\nheavy element abundance, ostensibly in the form of a\nlarge solid core, is a common feature of hot Jupiters\n(Gillon et al. 2007; Burrows et al. 2007a; Fortney et al.\n2007). The growing sample of transiting planets exhibit\nheavy-element masses ranging from tens of earth masses\nup to \u223c 100M\u2295 . For comparison, Jupiter is composed\nof 1\u201339 M\u2295 of heavy elements, and has a core mass\nranging from 0\u201311 M\u2295 (Saumon & Guillot 2004). Notably, the core masses of transiting planets correlate with\nthe metal abundances of the host stars, a finding that\nlends additional support for the core accretion model\nof planet formation (Guillot et al. 2006; Burrows et al.\n2007a; Torres et al. 2008).\nWhile many transiting exoplanets have large cores,\nothers have radii that far exceed the predictions of the\ncurrent suite of planetary interior models, even if a\nheavy-element core is omitted. These bloated planets\npose serious challenges to theoretical models of planetary interiors (Brown et al. 2001; Mandushev et al. 2007;\nBaraffe et al. 2003). The solution may lie in improved\nstellar age estimates, revised atmospheric opacities or a\nbetter understanding of chemistry and dynamics in planetary atmospheres (Chabrier et al. 2004; Burrows et al.\n2007b).\nPlanet transits also yield a measure of an additional\nfundamental orbital characteristic of planetary systems:\nthe spin-orbit alignment (Queloz et al. 2000). Measurements of a host star's radial velocity during the transit of\nits planet can reveal anomalous Doppler-shift variations\nknown as the Rossiter-McLaugnlin effect (Winn et al.\n2005; Gaudi & Winn 2007), and the time-dependent\nvariation of this effect is related to the projected angle\nbetween the star's spin axis and the planet's orbit normal, \u03bb (lower panel of Figure 3). The spin-orbit angle\nis a fundamental property of planetary systems, analogous to the eccentricity and semimajor axis. The majority of measured exoplanet spin-orbit angles are consistent with \u03bb = 0, and a single, isotropic distribution for exoplanet spin-orbit angles can be ruled out\nwith high confidence, even after accounting for projection effects (Winn et al. 2005; Fabrycky & Winn 2009).\nThis result suggests that the dominant mechanism responsible for the inward migration of planets preserves\nspin-orbit alignment (although H\u00e9brard et al. (2008) and\nWinn et al. (2009b) present a notable exception in the\nmisaligned XO-3 system).\n\n\f4\nHalf an orbital period after a planet transit, another\nobservational opportunity arises when the planet passes\nbehind the parent star. Observations made during these\noccultation events provide a means of detecting light\nfrom the planet itself, as revealed by the flux decrement caused by the star blocking the light from the\nplanet (Deming et al. 2005; Charbonneau et al. 2005).\nThe variation in the depth of the occultation light curve\nmeasured in different bandpasses provides a measure of\nthe planet's emission spectrum, which can then be compared to theoretical models to gain insights into the characteristics of planetary atmospheres. Observations of\nthis type made with space-based facilities such as Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and MOST,\nhave revealed evidence of temperature inversions in the\natmospheres of some planets (Knutson et al. 2009); detected molecules such as H2 0 and CO2 in their atmospheres (Grillmair et al. 2008); placed limits on their\nwavelength-dependent bond albedos (Rowe et al. 2008);\nand have been used to measure their eccentricities based\non the time interval between primary and secondary\neclipse (Demory et al. 2007).\n\ninteractions (Alibert et al. 2005; Ford et al. 2005).\n\n4. MULTIPLICITY\n\nThere are 31 known multi-planet systems orbiting\nnearby stars with well-characterized orbits (Figure 4;\nWright et al. 2009; Udry et al. 2007). These systems,\ntogether with single-planet systems with additional radial velocity trends, comprise 30% of all known planetary\nsystems within 200 pc. Five of the known multi-planet\nsystems systems are in mean-motion resonances, and two\nare known to contain four or more planets: the system\nof five planets around 55 Cnc and the four-planet system\naround \u03bc Ara (Fischer et al. 2008; Pepe et al. 2007). The\ncharacterization of multi-planet systems requires intensive follow-up observations, and the additional scrutiny\nhas resulted in the detection of some of the least massive planets currently known. The Gl876, 55 Cnc and\n\u03bc Ara systems all contain low-mass planets that were discovered by intensive Doppler follow-up, with MP sin i =\n5.89, 10.8 and 15 M\u2295 , respectively (Rivera et al. 2005;\nMcArthur et al. 2004; Fischer et al. 2008; Pepe et al.\n2007). The discovery of multi-planet systems has been\naided by improvements to the attainable Doppler precision, resulting in planetary systems containing multiple Neptune- and sub-Neptune-mass planets (Vogt et al.\n2005; Lovis et al. 2006; Mayor et al. 2009). The increasing time baselines of Doppler surveys, together with\nthe sensitivity of microlensing surveys, are bringing Solar System analogs within reach (Wright et al. 2007;\nGaudi et al. 2008).\nMulti-planet systems are valuable testing grounds for\ntheories of planet formation and migration (Ford 2006;\nTerquem & Papaloizou 2007). For example, planets\nshould form at arbitrary locations within the protoplanetary disk, and yet several multi-planet systems have been\ndetected in mean-motion resonances. These systems\nindicate that systems of planets migrate inward and\nare subsequently captured into resonant configurations\n(Marcy et al. 2001; Correia et al. 2009; Raymond et al.\n2008). Comparisons between the properties of multiplanet systems and those of systems containing only a\nsingle detectable planet provide important observational\nconstraints for theories of planet-planet and disk-planet\n\nFig. 4.- Chart showing the semimajor axes and minimum mases\nfor the 31 known planetary systems containing more than 1 planet\n(data from Wright et al. [2009], as updated by Correia et al. [2009],\nMayor et al. [2009] and Niedzielski et al. (2009)). The horizontal\nlines under each planet indicate the distance between periapse and\napoapse for eccentric orbits. The sizes of the planet symbols scale\nas (MP sin i)1/3 , and the labels denote the planet mass in units of\nMJup .\n\n5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nThe low-mass planets in short-period orbits detected\nby Doppler-based planet searches (Mayor et al. 2009)\nand those at wider separations detected via gravitational\nmicrolensing (Bennett et al. 2008) point the way toward\nthe future of exoplanet science: the detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. One of the primary\ngoals of the study of exoplanets is to determine whether\nsolar systems like our own exist elsewhere in the Galaxy\n(Lunine et al. 2008). However, the detection of an Earthmass planet in the terrestrial zone of a Sun-like star\n(late F-type to early K) poses a considerable technical\nchallenge. These small planets induce radial velocity\nvariations of \u223c 10 cm s\u22121 , astrometric variations of a\n\u223c 0.1 microacrseconds (\u03bcas), transit depths of \u223c 10\u22124 ,\nand have planet-star contrast ratios of 10\u221210 to 10\u22127 , for\nreflected light and thermal emission, respectively (e.g.\nSchneider 2002).\nOne immediate method of circumventing these technical hurdles is to first search for habitable worlds around\nM dwarfs. The amplitude of the Doppler variations induced by a planet of a given mass in the habitable zone\n\n\f5\n\u22123/2\n\nof a star scale as K \u221d M\u2217\n, and the transit depth\nscales as M\u2217\u22122 (assuming R\u2217 \u221d M\u2217 for he lower main\nsequence). The detection sensitivities are therefore an\norder of magnitude higher around a 0.25M\u2299 M dwarf\ncompared to a solar-type star. Targeted photometric\nand Doppler searches for transiting terrestrial planets in\nthe habitable zone of M dwarfs are currently underway\n(Butler et al. 2004; Bonfils et al. 2005; Irwin et al. 2008).\nThe low-mass planetary system tantalizingly close to the\nhabitable zone of the 0.4 M\u2299 M Dwarf Gl581 demonstrates the promise of searching for planets around lowmass stars (Udry et al. 2007).\nThe occurrence rate of terrestrial planets around Sunlike stars can be estimated from the frequency of exoplanets with masses intermediate to Earth and Neptune, commonly known as \"super-Earths.\" Planets with\nmasses \u223c 10M\u2295 in short-period orbits are readily detectable by Doppler surveys capable of \u223c 1 m s\u22121 precision, and several dedicated searches are currently underway using HARPS and Keck/HIRES (Mayor et al.\n2009; Howard et al. 2009). While these planets have\nmasses approaching the Earth's, it remains unclear\nwhether they are Earth-like with solid surfaces, or instead miniature Neptunes with massive envelopes of H\nand He (Valencia et al. 2007; Barnes et al. 2009). This\nissue will soon be addressed by the detection of transiting super-Earths around nearby, bright (V < 9)\nstars, for which Doppler follow-up can provide precise mass measurements. The recent demonstrations\nof sub-millimagnitude, ground-based transit photometry, together with the growing number of low-mass planets in short-period orbits suggest that the first nearby\n(d . 50 pc) transiting super-Earth will be detected in\nthe near future (Johnson et al. 2009; Gillon et al. 2008;\nWinn et al. 2009a).\nSearching for Earth-analogs around Sun-like stars\nis best pursued above the Earth's atmosphere. The\nCOROT and Kepler space missions will provide continuous high-precision photometric monitoring of hundreds\nof thousands of stars within select patches of the sky to\ndetect planets with a wide range of masses and orbital\ncharacteristics. Early results from COROT demonstrate\nthe advantages afforded by observing from space, both in\nterms of attainable photometric precision and continuous\ntemporal coverage, which increases detection sensitivity\nat longer orbital periods compared to ground-based surveys (Aigrain et al. 2008). The Kepler mission launched\n\nsuccessfully in March of this year and will maintain a\nphotometric precision of 20 micro-magnitudes over the\ncourse of 4 years (Borucki et al. 2004). The precision\nand time baseline of Kepler will provide a galactic census of terrestrial planets around Sun-like stars out to separations of 1\u20132 AU. The transiting systems detected by\nKepler and COROT will open up exciting new science directions for the next generation space observatories such\nas the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including atmospheric transmission spectroscopy and measuring the phase variations of thermal and reflected light\n(Seager et al. 2008).\nThe \"holy grail\" is the imaging detection, and subsequent spectroscopic study, of a terrestrial planet in\nthe habitable zone of a nearby star. Space-borne astrometry will provide a means of detecting and directly\nmeasuring the masses and orbital configurations of terrestrial planets. One such mission on the near horizon\nis the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM\u2013Lite), which\nwill provide an astrometric precision of better than 1 \u03bcas\n(Shao & Nemati 2008). Once Earth-like planets are identified, high-contrast imaging using techniques such as\nadaptive optics and coronography can be brought to bear\nto measure colors, and possibly even spectra, to search\nfor biosignatures. Ground-based imaging surveys are\nmaking impressive strides, and planet searches are now\nbeginning with the NICI campaign (Artigau et al. 2008,\n; Liu et al. 2009 in press) and in the near future with the\nGiant Planet Imager (Macintosh et al. 2008), with the\ngoal of detecting Jupiters in wide orbits. The technology\ndeveloped for and proven by these surveys, and others\nlike them, will inform future imaging efforts from space,\nsuch as the Terrestrial Planet Finder (Beichman et al.\n2004).\nIn just 14 years conceptions of planets around other\nstars have evolved from science fiction to a mature field\nof scientific inquiry. The next decade holds much promise\nas we progress toward the discoveries of solar systems like\nour own around other stars.\n\nI gratefully acknowledge Geoff Marcy, Andrew\nHoward, Debra Fischer, Jason Wright and Michael Liu\nfor their helpful conversations, feedback and edits.
