In recent years, the polarization state of single photons has been used to experimentally demonstrate\nquantum dense coding [2], quantum teleportation [3] and\nquantum cryptography [4, 5, 6]. However, due to the\ndifficulty of achieving quantum logic operations between\nindependent photons, the application of photon states\nhas been limited primarily to the field of quantum communication. More precisely, the two-qubit gates suitable\nfor quantum computation generically require strong interactions between individual photons, implying the need\nfor massive, reversible non-linearities well beyond those\npresently available for photons, as opposed to other physical systems [7].\nRemarkably, Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [8] found\na way to circumvent this problem and implement efficient quantum computation using only linear optics,\nphoto-detectors and single-photon sources. In effect they\nshowed that measurement induced nonlinearity was sufficient to obtain efficient quantum computation.\nThe logic schemes KLM proposed were not, however,\neconomical in their use of optical components or ancillary photons. Various groups have been working on\nreducing the complexity of these gates while improving their theoretical efficiency (see e.g. Koashi et al.\n[9]). In an exciting recent development, Nielsen [10]\nhas shown that efficient linear optical quantum computation is in fact possible without the elaborate teleportation and Z-measurement error correction steps in\nKLM. This is achieved by creation of linear optical versions of Raussendorf and Briegel's [11] cluster states.\nNielsen's method works for any non-trivial linear optical gate which succeeds with finite probability, but which,\nwhen it fails, effects a measurement in the computational\n\n\u2217 Present address: Physikalisches Institut, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg,\nD-69120 Heidelberg, Germany\n\u2020 Present address: Imperial College, Blackett Labs, Prince Consort\nRd, London SW7 2AZ\n\u2021 also at Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik und Quanteninformation,\n\u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften\n\nbasis.\nA crucial requirement of both KLM's and Nielsen's\nconstructions is classical feed-forwardability. Specifically,\nit must be in principle possible to detect when the gate\nhas succeeded by measurement of ancilla photons in some\nappropriate state. This information can then be fedforward in such a way as to condition future operations\non the photon modes.\nRecently [12, 13, 14] destructive linear optical gate operations have been realized. As they necessarily destroy\nthe output state, such schemes are not classically feedforwardable. In the present paper we report the first realization of a CNOT gate which operates on two polarization qubits carried by independent photons and that satisfies the feed-forwardability criterion. Moreover, when\ncombined with single qubit Hadamard rotations to perform a controlled-sign gate (so as to build the cluster\nstates of [11] via Nielsen's method) this gate also satisfies the criterion that when it fails the qubits can be\nprojected out in the computational basis.\nA CNOT gate flips the second (target) bit if and only if\nthe first one (control) has the logical value 1 and the control bit remains unaffected. The scheme we use to achieve\nthe CNOT gate was first proposed in [15] by Franson et\nal. and is shown in Fig.1. This scheme performs a CNOT\noperation on the input photons in spatial modes a1 and\na2 ; the output qubits are contained in spatial modes b1\nand b2 . The ancilla photons in the spatial modes a3 and\na4 are in the maximally entangled Bell state\n1\n|\u03c8a3 a4 i = \u221a (|Hia3 |Hia4 + |V ia3 |V ia4 )\n2\n\n(1)\n\nIn the following H (an horizontally polarized photon)\nand V (a vertically polarized one) will denote our logical\n0, 1. The scheme works in those cases where one and only\none photon is found in each of the modes b3 , b4 ; when\nboth photons are H polarized no further transformation\nis necessary on the output state (usually this is referred to\nas passive operation). The scheme combines two simpler\ngates, namely the destructive CNOT and the quantum\nencoder. The first gate can be seen in the lower part of\nthe Fig.1 and is constituted by a polarizing beam splitter\n\n\f2\n(PBS2) rotated by 45\u25e6 (the rotation is represented by the\ncircle drawn inside the symbol of the PBS), which works\nas a destructive CNOT gate on the polarization qubits,\nas was experimentally demonstrated in [15]. The upper\npart, comprising the entangled state and the PBS1, is\nmeant to encode the control bit in the two channels a4\nand b1 . The photons in the spatial modes a3 and a4 are\nin the maximally entangled Bell state 1\nThanks to the behaviour of our Polarizing Beam Splitter, that transmits horizontally polarized photons and\nreflects vertically polarized ones, the successful detection\nat the port b3 of the state |+i (the symbols +, \u2212 stand\nfor H + V and H \u2212 V ) post-selects the following transformation of the arbitrarily input state in a1\n\u03b1|Hia1 + \u03b2|V ia1 \u2192 \u03b1|HHia4 b1 + \u03b2|V V ia4 b1\n, thus we have the control bit encoded in a4 and in b1 , the\nphoton in a4 will be the control input to the destructive\nCNOT gate, and will thus be destroyed, while the second\nphoton in b1 will be the output control qubit.\nFor the gate to work properly, we want the most general input state\n|\u03a8a1 a2 i = |Hia1 (\u03b11 |Hia2 + \u03b12 |V ia2 )\n+ |V ia1 (\u03b13 |Hia2 + \u03b14 |V ia2 )\n\nto be converted to the output state\n|\u03a8a1 a2 i = |Hia1 (\u03b11 |Hia2 + \u03b12 |V ia2 )\n+ |V ia1 (\u03b13 |V ia2 + \u03b14 |Hia2 )\n\nLet us consider first the case where the control photon\nis in the logical zero (H polarization state). The control\nphoton will then travel undisturbed through the PBS,\narriving in the spatial mode b1 . As required, the output photon is H polarized. In order for the scheme to\nwork a photon needs to arrive also at the detector D3\nin b3 : given the input photon already in the mode b1 ,\nthis additional photon comes necessarily from the EPR\npair, and is H polarized as it is transmitted by the PBS1.\nWe know that the photons in a3 and a4 are correlated\n(1), so the photon in a4 is also in the horizontal polarization. Taking into account the \u221245\u25e6 rotation of the\npolarization on the paths a2 , a4 operated by the halfwave plates, the input in the PBS2 will then be the state\n| \u2212 \u2212ia2 a4 (| \u2212 +ia2 a4 ) for a target photon H (V) polarized. This state will give rise, with a probability of 50%,\nto the state where two photons go through the PBS2\n(|HHi \u00b1 |V V i)b2 b4 which, after the additional rotation\nof the polarization, and the subsequent change to the\nH/V basis (where the measurement will be performed)\nacquires the form (|HHi+|V V i)b2 b4 ((|HV i+|V Hi)b2 b4 ).\nThe expected result in the mode b2 H(V) for the case\nwhere the photon in b4 is horizontally polarized. We can\nsee in a similar way that the gate works also for the cases\n\nwhere the control photon is vertically polarized, or is polarized at 45\u25e6 .\nOur experimental setup is shown in Fig.2. In order to\nproduce the entangled pair of ancilla photons in modes a3\nand a4 , we use a type II Spontaneous Parametric Down\nConversion (SPDC) process; this pair is responsible for\nthe transmission of the quantum part of the information. We also need to produce the two input qubits in\nthe modes a1 and a2 to feed into the gate. In our setup\nthese input qubits are another SPDC pair, where photon\nnumber entanglement is used and two photons are simultaneously produced; the polarization entanglement is\ndestroyed by letting the photons pass through appropriate polarizers. Thanks to these polarization filters, and\nto appropriate half-wave plates, any desired two-qubits\ninput state can be prepared.\nAn ultraviolet pulsed laser, centered at a wavelength of\n398nm, with pulse duration 200fs and a repetition rate of\n76MH, impinges on a BBO crystal [16] producing probabilistically the first pair in the spatial modes a1 and\na2 : these two photons are fed into the gate as the input\nqubits. The UV laser is then reflected back by the mirror\nM1 and, passing through the crystal a second time, produces the entangled ancilla pair in spatial modes a3 and\na4 . Half-wave plates and non-linear crystals in the paths\nprovide the necessary birefringence compensation, and\nthe same half-wave plates are used to adjust the phase\nbetween the down converted photons (i.e. to produce the\nstate \u03c6+ ) and to implement the CNOT gate.\nWe then superpose the two photons at Alice's (Bob's)\nside in the modes a1 , a3 (a2 , a4 ) at a polarizing beam\nsplitter PBS1 (PBS2). Moving the mirror M1, mounted\non a motorized translation stage, allows to change the\narrival time to make the photons as indistinguishable\nas possible. A further degree of freedom is afforded\nby the mirror M2, whose movement on a micrometrical translation stage corrects slight asymmetries in the\narms of the set up. The indistinguishability between\nthe overlapping photons is improved by introducing narrow bandwidth (3nm) spectral filters at the outputs of\nthe PBSs and monitoring the outgoing photons by fibercoupled detectors. The single-mode fiber couplers guarantee good spatial overlap of the detected photons; the\nnarrow bandwidth filters stretch the coherence time to\nabout 700fs - substantially larger than the pump pulse\nduration [17]. The temporal and spatial filtering process effectively erases any possibility of distinguishing the\nphoton-pairs and therefore leads to interference.\nThe scheme we have described allows the output photons to travel freely in space, so that they may be further\nused in quantum communication protocols, and this is\nachieved by detecting one and only one photon in modes\nb3 and b4 . The fact that we do not yet have singlephoton detectors for this wavelength at our disposal actually forces us to implement a four-fold coincidence detection to confirm that photons actually arrive in the output\n\n\f3\nmodes b1 and b2 .\nSo far, we have analyzed only the ideal case where\nexactly one pair is produced at each passage of the UV\nlight beam through the BBO crystal. Let us see now how\nthe two-pair events are going to influence the outcomes.\nIt is easy to see that our gate cuts out those unwanted\ncases where two pairs are produced in the spatial modes\na3 , a4 : if the two photons in the spatial mode a3 are\nboth horizontally or vertically polarized, either two or no\nphotons will arrive at the detector D3. The alternative\ncase is that the pairs in each spatial mode (a3 , a4 ) have\ntwo photons that are in opposite polarization states; this\ncould produce either two or no photons in paths b3 and\nb4 . It is thus proved that no four-fold event may occur\nfrom an event of this kind.\nUnluckily, this kind of noise is present for superposed\nqubits; however, it may be easily measured and eliminated covering the spatial modes a3 and a4 and measuring the four-fold coincidences. Anyway, we note that the\nnoise is not intrinsic in the setup and is only due to practical drawbacks. Indeed, an unbalancing method like the\none used in [18] would allow one to increase the signal to\nnoise ratio to any desired value.\nOne more detail that should be addressed here is the\nproblem of birefringence. Each PBS introduces a small\nshift between the H and V components, thus deteriorating the overlap of the photon wavepackets. This birefringence is responsible for the presence of unwanted terms\nat the output state. The non-linear crystals put on the\noptical path are able to compensate for this as well, as\nremarked elsewhere [19].\nTo experimentally demonstrate that the gate works,\nwe first verify that we obtain the desired CNOT (appropriately conditioned) for the input qubits in states HH,\nHV, VH and VV. In Fig. 3 we compare the count rates\nof all 16 possible combinations. We see indeed that the\ngate is working properly in this basis. Having verified\nthis, we prove that the gate also works for a superposition of states. The special case where the control input is a 45\u25e6 polarized photon and the target qubit is a\nH photon is very interesting: we expect that the state\n|H + V ia1 |Hia2 evolves into the maximally entangled\nstate (|HHib1 b2 + |V V ib1 b2 ). This shows the reason why\nCNOT gates are so important: they can transform separable states into entangled states and vice versa. We\ninput the state |+ia1 |Hia2 ; first we measure the count\nrates of the 4 combinations of the output polarization\n(HH,..,VV) and observe that the contributions from the\nterms HV and VH are negligible with a fidelity of 81%.\nThen we prove that the output state is in a coherent superposition, which is done by a further polarization measurement. Going to the |+i, |\u2212i linear polarization basis\na Ou-Hong-Mandel interference measurement is possible;\nthis is shown in fig.4.\nTo sum up, the above demonstrated realization of a\nfeed-forwardable photonic CNOT gate uses only linear\n\noptics and entanglement. The non-linearities required in\nsuch an interaction are obtained through projective measurement of the ancilla pair. Our result is an important\nprogress in the direction of the realization of a quantum computer. The price we pay for a non-destructive\nscheme is the higher experimental sophistication, particularly the necessity to use high precision timing and\ncoincidence techniques.\nThis work was supported by the European Commission, contract numbers ERBFMRXCT960087 and IST1999-10033 and by the Austrian Science Foundation\n(FWF), project number S6506.\n\n\f4\nD3\n\n+/-\n\nb3\nb1\n\na1\n\nD1\n\nControl Bit\n\n[13] K.

A type II Spontaneous\nParametric Down Conversion is used both to produce the ancilla pair (in the spatial modes a3 and a4 ) and to produce the\ntwo input qubits (in the spatial modes a1 and a2 ). In this\ncase initial entanglement polarization is not desired, and it is\ndestroyed by making the photons go through polarization filters which prepare the required input state. Half-wave plates\nhave been placed in the photon paths in order to rotate the polarization; compensators are able to nullify the birefringence\neffects of the non-linear crystal and of the polarizing beam\nsplitters. Overlap of the wavepackets at the PBSs is assured\nthrough spatial and spectral filtering.\n\n[18] J.-W Pan et al. Nature 421, 721 (2003)\n[19] J.-W. Pan et al.

Four-fold coincidences for\nall the possible (16) combinations of inputs and outputs are\nshown. When the control qubit is in the logical value 0 (HH\nor HV), the gate works as the identity gate. In contrast, when\nthe control qubit is in the logical value 1 (VH or VV), the gate\nworks as a NOT gate, flipping the second input bit. Noise is\ndue to the non ideal nature of the PBSs.\n\na)\n120\n\n4-fold in 3000 s\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nb)\n\n0\nHH\n\nHV\n\nVH\n\nVV\n\n140\n\n+H++\n\n4-fold in 3000 s\n\n120\n\n+H+vis 66%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n6,1\n\n6,2\n\n6,3\n\n6,4\n\n6,5\n\n6,6\n\n6,7\n\n6,8\n\ndelay of the mirror (mm)\n\nFIG. 4: Demonstration of the ability of the CNOT gate to\ntransform a separable state into an entangled state.
