The violation is claimed to be by an exponentially\nincreasing amount as the number of particles n grows\n(n > 2). In fact, it is claimed to violate the local realistic\nmaximum by a factor of 2n\u22122 .\nHowever, this can not be true since all predictions (including all correlations and fluctuations) that separable\nquantum states give rise to have a local realistic description and thus satisfy all Bell-type inequalities, and this\nholds for all number of parties. Although this is known\nalready, let me nevertheless show this first (for the sake\nof completeness of the discussion) after which I will continue my comment on the work of Chen. Here, I will\ngeneralise the exposition by \u017bukowski [2] to the n-party\ncase.\nAny n-party Bell-type inequality has the following\ngeneric form\n\n|\n\nX\n\nk1 ,k2 ,...,kn\n\nc(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )E(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )| \u2264 B(c),\n\n(1)\nwhere k1 , k2 , etc. are labels that distinghuish various\n(discrete or continuous) measurement settings that can\nbe measured on system 1, 2, etc., c(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn ) are\ncertain constant coefficients, B(c) is the maximum value\nobtainable by a local realistic theory for the expression on\nthe left hand side of Eq. (1), and E(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn ) is the\n'correlation function' for outcomes of measurement with\nsettings k1 , k2 , . . . , kn , which for local realistic theories is\nassumed to be the expectation of the product of the local\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: seevinck@phys.uu.nl\n\nobservables:\nE(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn ) =\nZ\nA1 (k1 , \u03bb)A2 (k2 , \u03bb) . . . An (kn , \u03bb) p(\u03bb) d\u03bb.\n\n(2)\n\n\u039b\n\nHere \u03bb is an integration variable, often denoted as the\nhidden variable, the set \u039b is the set of hidden variables,\nand the functionals Ai (ki , \u03bb) are either the outcomes (+1\nor \u22121) of the measurements determined by the settings\nki and hidden variable \u03bb in case we are dealing with a\ndeterministic theory, or they are the expectation values\n(in the interval [\u22121, 1]) of these outcomes in the case of\na stochastic (non-deterministic) theory, and finally p(\u03bb)\nis a normalised probability distribution of the variable\n\u03bb. The Bell inequalities of Eq. (1) follow solely from the\nassumption of Eq. (2).\nLet us now suppose that we have an n-partite fully\nseparable quantum\nstate \u03c1, i.e., a convex sum of product\nP\nstates: \u03c1 = j pj \u03c11j \u2297\u03c12j \u2297. . .\u2297\u03c1nj , with \u03c1ij a density operator for party (subsystem) i.PThe index j is a summation\nor integration variable and j pj = 1, 0 \u2264 pj \u2264 1. The\ncorrelations these states give rise to all have the form\nh\u00c21 (k1 )\u00c22 (k2 )\u00c2n (kn )i\u03c1 :=\n\nTr[\u03c1 \u00c21 (k1 ) \u2297 \u00c22 (k2 ) . . . \u2297 \u00c2n (kn )] =\n(3)\nX\n1 1\n2 2\nn n\npj Tr [\u03c1j \u00c21 (k1 )]Tr [\u03c1j \u00c22 (k2 )] . . . Tr [\u03c1j \u00c2n (kn )],\nj\n\nwith Tri [ * ] the partial trace for party i (i.e., the rest of\nthe parties is traced out), and \u00c2i (ki ) the operator associated with the measurement on party i with setting\nki . Each such measurement has possible outcomes +1 or\n\u22121, just as was the case above [3]. Since we have that\n|Tri [\u03c1i \u00c2i (ki )]| = |h\u00c2i (ki )i\u03c1 | \u2264 max Ai (ki , \u03bb) the correlations of Eq. (3) can be written as in Eq. (2) and thus\nthey can be reproduced by a local realistic theory. They\nthus must satisfy all Bell-type inequalities of Eq. (1), i.e.,\n'those known at present, as well as those which one day\nwould be derived'[2]. Note that the same holds for all\nfluctuations a separable state can give rise to, cf. [4].\n\n\f2\nSince Chen claims otherwise by presenting a new inequality, claimed to be a Bell-type one, which separable\nstates supposedly can violate, there must be a flaw in\nthe argumentation. I will expose this flaw, not merely\nfor clarification of the issue, but perhaps even more importantly since it re-teaches us an old lesson John Bell\nhas made over 40 years ago, although in a different form.\nI will argue this lesson provides us with a new morale especially relevant to modern research in Bell inequalities.\nReview of Chen's results\nLet me first present the result of Chen's analysis. He\nconsiders the well-known Mermin-Roy-Singh-ArdehaliBelinski\u0131\u0306-Klyshko inequality for n-parties [5]. This inequality is characterised by a specific choise [6] of coefficients c(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn ) in Eq. (1), where each party\nchooses between two observables (i.e., each ki has two\npossibilities) that are furthermore dichotomic (\u00b11 valued). Chen takes the inequality to be normalised so that\nB(c) = 1, and chooses a specific choice of measurement\nsettings k1 , k2 . . . , kn , such that the two possible local settings for each party are given by orthogonal vectors (i.e.,\nAi (ki ) \u22a5 Ai (ki\u2032 )). Suppose that for this specific choice of\nsettings we define the so-called Bell polynomial [7]\nMn (\u03bb) :=\nX\nc(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )A1 (k1 , \u03bb)A2 (k2 , \u03bb) . . . An (kn , \u03bb).\nk1 ,k2 ,...,kn\n\n(4)\nIt follows from Ai (ki , \u03bb) = \u00b11 for all i that for the specific settings used \u22121 \u2264 Mn (\u03bb) \u2264 1. Because of linearity\nof the mean (i.e., the linear combination in Eq. (1) can\nalso be evaluated under the expectation value) the Bell\ninequality Eq. (1) (for the specific choise of coefficients\nc(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )) can be reformulated as an upperbound\non the expectation of this Bell polynomial Mn (\u03bb). Indeed, local realism predicts the result that\nZ\n|hMn iLHV | = | Mn (\u03bb) p(\u03bb) d\u03bb| \u2264 1,\n(5)\n\nR\nwith the expectation value hXiLHV := \u03bb X(\u03bb)p(\u03bb) d\u03bb.\nThis is in fact a shorthand notation for the Bell-type\ninequality\nX\nc(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )E(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )| \u2264 1, (6)\n|\nk1 ,k2 ,...,kn\n\nwith the correlation E( * ) given by Eq. (2). This the\nMermin-Roy-Singh-Ardehali-Belinski\u0131\u0306-Klyshko inequality [5].\nThe quantum mechanical counterpart of this inequality is obtained as follows. Choose p(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb \u2212 \u03c1) with \u03c1\na quantum mechanical state of n qubits, and next substitute the measurement functionals in the Bell polynomial\nby the operators associated to the measurements to give\nits quantum counterpart which is denoted by the operator M\u0302n :\nX\nc(k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )\u00c21 (k1 )\u00c22 (k2 ) . . . \u00c2n (kn ).\nM\u0302n :=\nk1 ,k2 ,...,kn\n\n(7)\n\nThe\nlocal\nsettings\nare\nanticommuting\n(i.e.\n{\u00c2i (ki ), \u00c2i (ki\u2032 )} = 0) since this incorporates the\nlocal orthogonality of the dichotomic observables.\nAfter this conversion we obtain the well-known result\n[5] that quantum mechanics obeys the inequality\n|hM\u0302n i\u03c1 | \u2264 2(n\u22121)/2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the expectation value hX\u0302i\u03c1 := Tr[X\u0302\u03c1]. The upperbound can be achieved by the maximally entangled\nGHZ states.\nIf we set n = 2 in Eq. (6) we obtain the original CHSH\ninequality for local realism and for n = 2 in Eq. (8) we\nget the Tsirelson inequality for quantum mechanics.\nChen now considers the quantum mechanical operator\nV\u0302n := M\u0302n + M\u03022n ,\n\n(9)\n\nand shows that\nhV\u0302n i\u03c1 := Tr[\u03c1V\u0302n ]\n\n= Tr[\u03c1M\u0302n ] + Tr[\u03c1M\u03022n ]\n\n= hM\u0302n i\u03c1 + hM\u0302n i2\u03c1 + \u2206(M\u0302n )\u03c1 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u2206(M\u0302n ) = h(M\u0302n \u2212hM\u0302n i\u03c1 )2 i\u03c1 the variance of M\u0302n in\nthe state \u03c1. For separable quantum states \u03c1sep he obtains\nthe bound hV\u0302n i\u03c1sep \u2264 2n\u22121 , which is tight since it can be\nachieved by a separable state (see [8]).\nLocal realism gives Eq. (5), and Chen furthermore\nclaims that\nZ\n\u2206(Mn )LHV :=\n(Mn (\u03bb) \u2212 hMn iLHV )2 p(\u03bb) d\u03bb\n= hM2n iLHV \u2212 hMn i2LHV\n\u2264 1 \u2212 hMn i2LHV ,\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nfrom which it follows that\nhVn iLHV := hMn iLHV + hM2n iLHV\n\n= hMn iLHV + hMn i2LHV + \u2206(Mn )LHV \u2264 2.\n(13)\n\nChen thus obtains that hVn iLHV \u2264 2 whereas\nhV\u0302n i\u03c1sep \u2264 2n\u22121 and since this last bound can be achieved\nby separable states, he concludes that for n > 2 they violate the local realistic inequality by an exponentially large\nfactor. This conclusion contradicts the previous analysis\nthat the correlations in separable states can be reproduced by local realism. So where did Chen's analysis go\nwrong?\nExposing the problematic relation\nLet us first note that in Eq. (12) it must have been used\nthat\nZ\nhM2n iLHV = (Mn (\u03bb))2 p(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2264 1,\n(14)\nwhich follows from (Mn (\u03bb))2 \u2264 1 that on its turn follows\nfrom the fact that \u22121 \u2264 Mn (\u03bb) \u2264 1.\n\n\f3\nUsing this we see that Chen's claim follows solely from\nthe quantum mechanical inequality\nhM\u03022n i\u03c1 \u2264 2n\u22121 ,\n\n(15)\n\nand the fact that Eq. (15) can be saturated for separable\nstates. Comparing this to Eq. (14) it would seem that\nalready for n = 2 separable states give rise to correlations\nthat can not be reproduced by local realism.\nHowever, it is of course not Mn (\u03bb) that is measured in\nany experiment, but the observables Ai (ki , \u03bb). But this\ncaptures only part of the problem since, as we have seen\nMn (\u03bb) can nevertheless be used to obtain a legitimite\nBell-type inequality (i.e. Eq. (6)), whereas (Mn (\u03bb))2 can\nnot \u2013 or so I claim. What accounts for this difference?\nA first starting point is to note that the operator\nV\u0302n = M\u0302n + M\u03022n of Eq. (9) should be translated into its\nhidden variable counterpart as Vn (\u03bb) = Mn (\u03bb)+M2n (\u03bb).\nBut in order for Chen's analysis to go through, he must\nhave translated this into Vn (\u03bb) = Mn (\u03bb) + (Mn (\u03bb))2 .\nChen must thus have assumed that M2n (\u03bb) = (Mn (\u03bb))2 ,\nand since M\u0302n and M\u03022n commute this seems a reasonable\nrequirement. Indeed, but only if the quantity Mn (\u03bb) can\nbe considered unproblematically as a hidden variable observable. However, I will now argue that this is not the\ncase.\nLet's take a closer look at the Bell polynomial Mn (\u03bb)\nof Eq. (4), and - one is reminded of Bell's 1966 critique\n[9] on von Neumann's 'no-go theorem' - it then becomes\napparent that the definition of Mn (\u03bb) uses a suspicious\nadditivity of incompatible observables, since it involves\ndifferent local setting (ki 6= ki\u2032 ). Because of this the Bell\npolynomial of Eq. (4) can not be considered to be an\nobservable that local realism determines, and is never\nmeasured as such, since, as Bell has taught us, \"a measurement of a sum of noncommuting observables cannot\nbe made by combining trivially the results of separate observations on the two terms \u2013 it requires a quite distinct\nexperiment. [. . . ] But this explanation of the nonadditivity of allowed values also established the nontriviality of\nthe additivity of expectation values. The latter is quite\na peculiar property of quantum mechanical states, not\nto be expected a priori. There is no reason to demand\nit individually of the hypothetical dispersion free states\n[hidden variable states \u03bb], whose function it is to reproduce the measurable peculiarities of quantum mechanics\nwhen averaged over. \"[9]. For Bell an expression involving noncommuting spin observables such as [\u03c3x + \u03c3y ](\u03bb)\ncould not be assumed to be equal to \u03c3x (\u03bb) + \u03c3y (\u03bb).\nIf we apply Bell's lesson to Chen's analysis we obtain\nthat measurement of the Bell polynomial Mn (\u03bb) can not\nbe made by combining trivially the results of noncommuting observables. The hidden variables \u03bb only determine the outcomes Ai (ki , \u03bb) of individual measurements\n(with settings ki ) and not the outcomes of measurement\nof the quantity Mn (\u03bb) since the latter involves incompatible observables. The only function of the Bell polynomial Mn (\u03bb) is to allow for a shorthand notation of\nthe Bell-type inequalities. Indeed, when averaged over\n\u03bb it gives the inequality Eq. (5), which by using linearity of the mean can be rewritten as a sum of expectation values in a legitimate local realistic form, namely as\n\nthe legitimate Bell-type inequality of Eq. (6) that local\nrealism must satisfy. Indeed, all expectation values in\nthe Bell-type inequality Eq. (6) involve only commuting\n(compatible) quantities, and no noncommuting ones. So\nalthough Mn (\u03bb) cannot be thought of as an observable\nspecifying the sum of local realistic quantities determined\nby the hidden variable \u03bb, and as such is never measured\nin an experiment, when averaged over it does allow for\na legitimate shorthand notation of the Bell-type inequality Eq. (6). This is the reason why the hidden variable\ncounterpart of the operator M\u0302n can be safely chosen to\nbe the Bell-polynomial Mn (\u03bb).\nHowever, I will now argue that from a local realistic\npoint of view such a manouvre cannot performed for the\nfunctional (Mn (\u03bb))2 .\nFirstly, (Mn (\u03bb))2 is not the legitimite hidden variable\ncounterpart of the operator (M\u0302n )2 . Thus when averaged over it gives the inequality Eq. (14) but this is not\na legitimite local realistic counterpart of the inequality\nEq. (15). This can be easily seen from the following example. Suppose we take n = 2 and use the observables\nA and A\u2032 and B and B \u2032 for party 1 and 2 respectively.\nThen if we expand (M2 (\u03bb))2 we get\n(M2 (\u03bb))2 =\n\n1 2\n1\n(A + A\u20322 )(B 2 + B \u20322 ) + AA\u2032 (B 2 \u2212 B \u20322 )\n4\n2\n1\n\u2032\n2\n\u20322\n+ BB (A \u2212 A ),\n(16)\n2\n\nwhere the dependency of A, A', B, and B' on \u03bb has been\nomitted for clarity. However, if we expand (M\u03022 )2 (and\nusing the local anticommutativity) we get\n1 2\n(\u00c2 + \u00c2\u20322 ) \u2297 (B\u0302 2 + B\u0302 \u20322 ) \u2212 (\u00c2\u00c2\u2032 \u2297 B\u0302 B\u0302 \u2032 )\n4\n1\n= (\u00c22 + \u00c2\u20322 ) \u2297 (B\u0302 2 + B\u0302 \u20322 ) + (\u00c2\u2032\u2032 \u2297 B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 ),\n4\n(17)\n\n(M\u03022 )2 =\n\nwith \u00c2\u2032\u2032 = [\u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 ]/2i and B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 = [B\u0302, B\u0302 \u2032 ]/2i some self adjoint operators (with eigenvalues \u00b11) that can be thought\nto correspond to some well defined observables. We indeed see that Eq. (17) is structurally different from the\nlocal realistic expression Eq. (16), and they can therefore\nnot be considered to be the counterpart of eachother.\nThe correct local realistic counterpart of (M\u03022 )2 is obtained by translating Eq. (17) directly into\nM2 (\u03bb) :=\n\n1 2\n(A + A\u20322 )(B 2 + B \u20322 ) + A\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 ,\n4\n\n(18)\n\nwith A\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 some dichotomic \u00b11 valued observables\nthat are the local realistic counterpart of respectively \u00c2\u2032\u2032\nand B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 . (The dependency of the right hand side quantitities on \u03bb has again been omitted for clarity). The functional M2 (\u03bb) (and not (M2 (\u03bb))2 ) is the Bell-polynomial\nthat, when averaged over and using linearity of the mean,\ngives the Bell-type inequality which is the counterpart of\nthe quantum mechanical inequality using (M\u03022 )2 .\nSecondly, when averaged over (Mn (\u03bb))2 does not give\na shorthand notation for a Bell-type inequality or any\nother constraint which local realism must obey. Invoking\nlinearity of the mean does not help here.\n\n\f4\nThe reason for this is that we end up with the above\nmentioned problem that Bell pointed out: we get expectation values of the products of noncommuting (incompatible) observables which cannot be determined by\ncombining measurements of the individual observables.\nTo see this we expand Mn (\u03bb))2 in h(Mn (\u03bb))2 iLHV , as\nwas done in Eq. (16) for n = 2. We then get terms\nlike h[. . . Ai (ki , \u03bb)Ai (ki\u2032 , \u03bb) . . .]iLHV , which for ki 6= ki\u2032 involve incompatible experiments that correspond to locally anticommuting operators in quantum mechanics.\nIndeed, it is precisely this local noncommutativity, i.e.,\n\u00c2i (ki )\u00c2i (ki\u2032 ) = \u2212\u00c2i (ki\u2032 )\u00c2i (ki ), that has no counterpart\nfor local realistic observables, which is responsible for\nthe structural differences in Eq. (16) and Eq. (17) and\nwhich Chen uses to get the exponentially diverging result\nthat h(Mn (\u03bb))2 iLHV \u2264 1 whereas hM\u03022n i\u03c1 \u2264 2(n\u22121 (with\nthe latter tight for separable quantum states). But we\nhave seen that for local realism these expectation values\nof the products of noncommuting (incompatible) observables are problematic for precise the same reason as why\nadditivity of expectation values is problematic for the\nsum of noncommuting observables: measurement of the\nproduct of noncommuting observables requires a quite\ndistinct experiment from the experiments used to measure the individual terms in the product.\nThus Bell's critique on von Neumann's no-go theorem\nequally well applies here too: \"[. . . ] the formal proof\ndoes not justify his informal conclusion\"[9], i.e., although\nChen's proof is mathematically correct and as such is interesting, his conclusion is nevertheless wanting since the\nlocal hidden variable theorist would not be enforced to\nregard the assumption Eq. (14) as the legitimite counterpart of Eq. (15), nor to regard (Mn (\u03bb))2 as a legitimite\nshorthand notation for any sort of Bell-type inequality.\nChen's analysis thus breaks down.\nIt is thus not the strength of correlations or fluctuations in separable states which ruled out local realism,\nbut \"[i]t was the arbitrary assumption of a particular\n(and impossible) relation between he results of incompatible measurements either of which might be made on\na given occasion but only one of which can in fact be\nmade.\"[9]\nRepercussions for modern research\non Bell-type inequalities\nIn modern research on Bell-type inequalities (see [1, 5, 7,\n10], however cf. [11]) one often considers recursive definitions and shorthand notations in terms of Bell polynomials [7] (e.g., see Eq. (4)) and their quantum mechanical\ncounterparts, the so called Bell operators. The latter are\nparticular linear combinations of operators that correspond to products of local observables. Examples of such\nBell-operators are M\u0302n in the multi-partite setting or for\nexample B\u0302 = \u00c2B\u0302 + \u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 + \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2212 \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 for the bi-partite\nsetting. In quantum mechanics these operators M\u0302n and\nB\u0302 can be considered to be observables themselves since\na sum of self-adjoint operators is again self-adjoint and\nevery self-adjoint operator is supposed to correspond to\nan observable. Furthermore, the additivity of operators\ngives additivity of expectation values. (This is the rea-\n\nson why the operators M\u0302n and M\u03022n that Chen uses can\nbe considered to be proper quantum mechanical observables.)\nThus the so called Tsirelson inequality expressed as\n\u221a\n|h\u00c2B\u0302i\u03c1 + h\u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 i\u03c1 + h\u00c2\u2032 B\u0302i\u03c1 \u2212 h\u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 i\u03c1 | \u2264 2 2\n(19)\ncan thus equally \u221a\nwell be expressed in a shorthand notation as |hB\u0302i\u03c1 | \u2264 2 2, with B\u0302 = \u00c2B\u0302 + \u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 + \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2212 \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 .\nHowever, as noted by Bell and as cited before in this\nnote, this is additivity of expectation values is \"a quite\npeculiar property of QM, not to be expected a priori\"\nfor the hidden variable states \u03bb. Thus for Bell-type inequalities such a shorthand notation involves taking care\nof some crucial subtleties. I will now discuss three such\nsubtleties that should be taken into account in deriving\nBell-type inequalities, and then relate them to the discussion of the previous section.\n(I) Firstly, the local realistic Bell polynomials are not\nto be regarded as observables. The danger is that because the operator identity in quantum mechanics B\u0302 =\n\u00c2B\u0302 + \u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 + \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2212 \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 does indeed define a new observable B\u0302, one is tempted to formulate the hidden variable\ncounterpart as:\nB(\u03bb) = A(\u03bb)B(\u03bb)+A(\u03bb)B \u2032 (\u03bb)+A\u2032 (\u03bb)B(\u03bb)\u2212A\u2032 (\u03bb)B \u2032 (\u03bb).\n(20)\nHowever, if B(\u03bb) is not regarded as merely a shorthand\nnotation for the sum of the four terms in Eq. (20), but\nis supposed to be the counterpart of the observable B\u0302,\nEq. (20) involves the problematic additivity of eigenvalues, which cannot be demanded of local realism. Indeed,\nfour different non-compatible setups are involved and not\njust one, which the notation B(\u03bb) when considered as a\nsingle observable could suggest.\nThus, when deriving local hidden variable observables\nthat depend on the hidden variable \u03bb, only compatible\nexperimental setups must be considered. The difficulty\nof measuring incompatible observables thus has to be explicitly taken into account in the hidden variable expression. This is different from quantum mechanics where\nthe incompatibility structure already is captured in the\n(non-)commutativity structure of the operators that correspond to the observables in question.\n(II) Secondly, when using a shorthand notation it must\nbe possible (by for example using linearity of the mean)\nto translate the shorthand notation into a legitimate Belltype inequality which a local realist cannot but accept or\ninto any other legitimate local realistic constraint. As\nan example, note that we have seen that Mn (\u03bb) did allow for formulating a legitimite Bell inequality whereas\n(Mn (\u03bb))2 did not.\n(III) Thirdly, suppose one would indeed regard the\nfunctionals Mn (\u03bb) and B(\u03bb) to be the quantities of interest and regard them as observables. The first subtlety\nmentioned above shows that this is unproblematic only if\nthey are thought of as being genuine irreducible observables and not to be composed out of other incompatible\nobservables. Then to be fair to local realism from the\nstart the possible values of measurement of these observables Mn (\u03bb) and B(\u03bb) in the local realist model should\nthen be equal to the eigenvalues of the quantum mechanical counterparts M\u0302n and B\u0302. And these eigenvalues are\n\n\f5\n\u221a\n\u221a\n{2(n\u22121)/2 , \u22122(n\u22121)/2 , 0} and {2 2, \u22122 2, 0} respectively. The possible outcomes for the local realist quantities should equal these eigenvalues, and then no violation can be seen to occur. Indeed, predictions for a single\nobservation can always be mimicked by a local realistic\nmodel. Furthermore, if we now go back to the problematic operator M\u03022n that Chen considered, we see that it\nhas eigenvalues {2(n\u22121) , 0}, (see footnote [8]), whereas it\nwas assumed that its local realistic counterpart has outcomes in [\u22121, 1], and can thus by construction, and not\nbecause of local realism, never reproduce the quantum\noutcomes.\nUsing these three subtleties we can now understand in\na different way where Chen's analysis has gone astray:\n(i) If we think of Eq. (14) as a mere shorthand notation\nof a complex summation, then the second subtlety is the\nmajor problem. On this reading the functional (Mn (\u03bb))2\ncannot be taken to give a constraint (i.e., Eq. (14)) which\nis a shorthand notation of a legitimate Bell-type inequality. (ii) However, one can argue that the analysis of Chen\ndoes not treat the Bell polynomial Mn (\u03bb) in Eq. (4) as\nmerely a shorthand notation for a complex summation.\n\n[1] Z.\nChen,\n'Variants\nof\nBell\ninequalities',\nquant-ph/0611126 (2006).\n[2] M. \u017bukowski, 'Separability of Quantum States vs. Original Bell (1964) Inequalities', Found. Phys. 36, 541\n(2006).\n[3] Note that in order to distinghuish between the local realistic observables (i.e., measurement functionals) and the\nquantum mechanical operators, I denote the quantum\nmechanical operators that correspond to observables in\nthe local realistic expression by a 'hat'. This difference\nwill become crucial, which will become clear later on.\n[4] Consider a bipartite scenario.
