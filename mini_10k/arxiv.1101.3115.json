KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1 Introduction\nThis paper suggest a solution for the problem of so-called\n'catastrophic quenching' of the alpha-effect of the meanfield dynamo theory. The standard alpha-effect of helical\nturbulent motions (Parker 1955; Steenbeck, Krause & R\u00e4dler 1966) with its standard (algebraic) quenching by a magnetic field (Moffatt 1972; R\u00fcdiger 1974; Roberts & Soward\n1975; R\u00fcdiger & Kitchatinov 1993) is only a part of the total alpha-effect known in the mean-field theory. Friesh et\nal. (1975) were probably the first to notice that not only\nhelical motions but small-scale helical magnetic fields produce the alpha-effect. This magnetic contribution was later\nrecognised to lead to the catastrophic quenching of the total alpha-effect (Vainshtein & Cattaneo 1992; Gruzinov &\nDiamond 1994; Blackman & Brandenburg 2002).\nThe term 'catastrophic' is used in the sense that the ar2\ngument of the quenching function is Rm B 2 /Beq\n, not just\n2\n2\nB /Beq as in the case of a standard algebraic quenching\n(Rm = \u03b7t /\u03b7 is the ratio of turbulent \u03b7t to microscopic\n\u221a\n\u03b7 magnetic diffusivity, and Beq = \u03bc\u03c1 u\u2032rms is the energy equipartition value of a magnetic field). The magnetic\nReynolds number, Rm , in astrophysical fluids is normally\nso large that even a very small mean field B suppresses the\nalpha-effect in the case of catastrophic quenching.\nThis type of magnetic quenching is related to the conservation of magnetic helicity. Its origin is, briefly, as follows.\nThe large-scale magnetic fields generated by the alpha-effect dynamos are helical. As the magnetic helicity is conserved, small-scale magnetic fields attain helicity equal in\namount and opposite in sign to that of large-scale fields. Helical small-scale fields produce their own magnetic alpha\u22c6 Corresponding author: e-mail: kit@iszf.irk.ru\n\neffect that counteracts the acting alpha-effect of whatever\norigin so that the total alpha-effect vanishes. Detailed discussions of catastrophic quenching can be found in literature (cf., e.g., Brandenburg & Subramanian 2005).\nCatastrophic quenching presents a serious problem for\nthe cosmic dynamo theory. The currently leading idea in resolving the problem for the sun is the evacuation of smallscale magnetic helicity from the solar interior by helicity\nfluxes (Vishniac & Cho 2001; Guerrero, Chatterjee & Brandenburg 2010) and then from the solar corona by coronal\nmass ejections (Brandenburg 2009). However, coronal ejections can evacuate only a minor part of magnetic helicity\n(Kliem, Rust & Seehafer 2010).\nThis paper suggests another solution related to nonlocal formulation of the alpha-effect. If the region where the\ntoroidal field is concentrated is spatially separated from the\nregion where the poloidal field is produced by the alphaeffect, the large-scale fields generated will not be helical,\nand the problem of catastrophic quenching does not arise.\nTo show this, we use a numerical model of the \u03b1\u03a9-dynamo\nwith a nonlocal alpha-effect of the Babcock-Leighton type\n(cf., e.g., Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999). Another important ingredient of our model is the diamagnetic pumping of\nlarge-scale fields. The pumping ensures that toroidal fields\nare concentrated near the base of the convection zone away\nfrom the near-top region where the alpha-effect is active.\nThe dynamical equation for the magnetic part of the alphaeffect is involved. This normally leads to a strong (catastrophic) suppression of the dynamo. We actually find catastrophic quenching when changing to a local formulation of\nthe alpha-effect in our model. The nonlocal model, however,\ndoes not show any sign of catastrophic quenching. With the\nlargest Rm = 104 we can apply, the results of the runs with\nthe magnetic alpha-effect included or neglected are practically the same. The nonlocal model reproduces the main\n\nc 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f2\n\nL.L. Kitchatinov & S.V.

There are also some disagreements with observations showing ways for model improvement.\n\n2 The model\n2.1 Dynamical equation for \u03b1M\nOur dynamo model is based on the mean-field induction\nequation\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (E + u \u00d7 B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207 \u00d7 B) ,\n(1)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03b7 is the microscopic diffusivity, u is the mean velocity, and E = hu\u2032 \u00d7 B \u2032 i is the mean electromotive force.\nThe electromotive force in its local formulation,\nE = hu\u2032 \u00d7 B \u2032 i = (\u03b1K + \u03b1M )B + ...,\n\n(2)\n\nincludes the magnetic alpha-effect \u03b1M together with the standard kinetic \u03b1K .\nThe heuristic dynamical equation for the \u03b1M\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b7t E * B\n\u03b1M\n\u2202\u03b1M\n(3)\n+ \u2207 * F = \u22122 2\n+\n2\n\u2202t\nl\nBeq\nRm\n\n(Kleeorin & Ruzmaikin 1982; Blackman & Brandenburg\n2002) can be formulated without specification of a particular form of the mean electromotive force E; l is the correlation length. For a uniform mean field, however, Eq. (2)\napplies and the steady value of the total \u03b1 = \u03b1K + \u03b1M can\nbe estimated to be\n\u03b1K\n\u03b1=\n(4)\n2 .\n1 + Rm BB2\neq\n\nThis equation describes catastrophic quenching of the\nalpha-effect. We shall use the Eq. (3) in our model of solar dynamo to see that the dynamo is strongly suppressed\nwhen the local formulation (2) for the alpha-effect is applied. Note that the magnetic alpha-effect is local by nature\nin contrast to the kinetic alpha-effect that allows a nonlocal\nformulation (Blackman & Brandenburg 2002; Brandenburg\n& K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 2007).\nWith a nonlocal formulation for the kinetic alpha-effect,\nthe toroidal field may be small in the region where the alphaeffect is active. The \u03b1M is also small in this case and catastrophic quenching does not happen. We shall see that this\npossibility can indeed be realised in a dynamo model with a\nnonlocal (kinetic) alpha-effect.\n2.2 Dynamo equations\nOur model accounts for the diamagnetic pumping of mean\nfields with an effective velocity of\n1\n(5)\nV dia = \u2212 \u2207\u03b7t .\n2\nDiamagnetic pumping was predicted analytically by Zeldovich (1957) and R\u00e4dler (1968). The diamagnetic effect\nof inhomogeneous turbulence lacks pictorial explanation\nbut its existence has been confirmed by direct numerical\n\nc 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\nsimulations (Brandenburg et al. 1996; Dorch & Nordlund\n2001; Ziegler & R\u00fcdiger 2003) and by laboratory experiment with turbulent liquid Sodium (Spence et al. 2007).\nThe concentration of magnetic fields at the base of convection zone by the diamagnetic pumping can be important\nfor a dynamo (R\u00fcdiger & Brandenburg 1995; Guerrero &\nde Gouveia Dal Pino 2008; Kitchatinov & R\u00fcdiger 2008).\nWith allowance for the diamagnetic pumping, the mean\nelectromotive force reads\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b7T B + \u03b1M B + A,\n(6)\nE = \u2212 \u03b7T \u2207 \u00d7\n\nwhere \u03b7T = \u03b7+\u03b7t is total magnetic diffusivity and A stands\nfor the contribution of the kinetic alpha-effect that can be\nwritten as\nZ\nA = \u03b1\u0302(r, r \u2032 )B(r \u2032 ) d3 r\u2032 .\n(7)\n\nWith \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1K \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ), we recover the local alpha-effect.\nThe kernel function \u03b1\u0302 for the nonlocal formulation will be\nspecified later.\nWe will consider an axisymmetric dynamo in a spherical shell. The magnetic field in this case can be written as\na superposition of its toroidal part B and a poloidal field\ndefined with a toroidal potential A:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\nB = e\u03c6 B + \u2207 \u00d7 e\u03c6\n,\n(8)\nr sin \u03b8\nwhere standard spherical coordinates are used and e\u03c6 is the\nazimuthal unit vector.\nNormalized variables are used. Time is measured in un2\nits of R\u2299\n/\u03b70 ; \u03b70 is the characteristic value of total diffusivity. The magnetic field is normalized to the field strength\nB0 for which nonlinear effects become essential, and the \u03b1parameter - to its characteristic value \u03b10 . The poloidal field\n3\npotential is measured in units of \u03b10 B0 R\u2299\n/\u03b70 .

The hb -parameter is\nthe thickness of the near-bottom region of toroidal magnetic\nfields producing the alpha-effect. The h\u03b1 is the thickness of\nthe near-surface region where this alpha-effect is produced.\nThe nonlocal alpha-effect with the kernel function (17) is\nvery similar to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism for the\npoloidal field production used in the dynamo models of Durney (1995) and Dikpati & Charbonneau (1999).\nTo compare the results of the simulations for nonlocal\nand local alpha-effects we will need a local formulation of\nthis effect, which can be obtained by applying the kernel\nfunction\n2\u03b7\u0302\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n.\n(18)\n\u03b1\u0302(x, x\u2032 ) =\n1 + B2\nThe diffusivity profile of our model reads\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\nx \u2212 x\u03b7\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b7(x) = Rm + (1 \u2212 Rm ) 1 + erf\n.

To resolve the fine nearbottom structure, a nonuniform grid over the radius with the\ngrid spacing \u2206x \u223c \u03b7 1/2 was applied. The grid over the\nlatitude was uniform. All the results of the next Section do\nnot depend on numerical resolution. This was checked by\nrepeating the runs with doubled resolution.\nEquatorial symmetry was usually not prescribed. The\nfield was evolved in time starting from a mixed-parity initial\nfield and the solution relaxed eventually to a certain equatorial symmetry. In order to determine the critical dynamo\nnumbers for excitation of the dipolar (B(\u03b8) = \u2212B(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8))\nand quadrupolar (B(\u03b8) = B(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)) dynamo modes, additional boundary conditions selecting the field mode of certain equatorial symmetry were imposed on the equator.\n\nFig. 3 Time dependencies of the volume-averaged square\nof the toroidal field hB 2 i for the runs with algebraic (\u03b1M =\n0, upper line) and catastrophic (\u03b1M 6= 0) quenching of the\nlocal alpha effect of Eq.

(18). The upper line in this Figure was\nobtained with the \u03b1M put to zero in the poloidal field equation (12). Saturation of the dynamo in this case is due to\nthe usual algebraic quenching of the alpha-effect. The lower\nline represents the computation with allowance for the magnetic alpha, \u03b1M , governed by the dynamical equation (13).\nMagnetic energy considerably decreases in this case indicating catastrophic quenching of the dynamo.\nIn the model with the nonlocal alpha-effect of Eq. (17),\nsaturation of the dynamo is due to the standard algebraic\nquenching only. The results of Fig. 4 for \u03b1M neglected or\nincluded are practically the same. When algebraic quenching is switched off by omitting B 2 in the denominator of\nthe first equation of (17), but \u03b1M is kept finite, field growth\nc 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The\ntwo bottom lines show the results of the runs with \u03b1M = 0\n(full line) and for the complete model (\u03b1M 6= 0, dotted line).\nThese two lines are hard to distinguish by eye. The upper\nline is for the computation neglecting the algebraic alphaquenching. The field growth does not saturate in this case in\nspite of the finite \u03b1M .

Clearly, the \u03b1M does not play any role in\nthese simulations.\nThe reason for the inefficiency of \u03b1M in the nonlocal\ndynamo model can be seen from Fig. 5, which shows the\nmagnetic field patterns for several instances of a magnetic\ncycle. The toroidal field is highly concentrated at the bottom. It is small in the near-top region where the alpha-effect\nis active. In this case, the alpha-effect does not contribute to\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron.

The pictures of the upper\nrow are rescaled so that the upper (dashed) boundary shows\nthe radius of r = 0.74R\u2299 below which the toroidal fields\nare localized.

The small-scale magnetic helicity balancing the helicity of large-scale fields is\nnot produced and the \u03b1M is small.\nIt should be noted that the non-locality of the alphaeffect alone does not guaranty nonoccurrence of catastrophic quenching. If the toroidal field in the near-top region\nof the alpha-effect has same sign and same order of magnitude as the near-bottom toroidal field that produces this\nalpha-effect, then catastrophic quenching can still happen\n(Brandenburg & K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 2007). It can be imagined, however, that if such a distributed toroidal field has opposite\nsigns near the top and near the bottom, then catastrophic\namplification of the magnetic field will happen.\nWhat excludes the catastrophic quenching in our model\nis the joint effect of non-locality and diamagnetic confinement of the toroidal field in the near-bottom region. This\nregion has been long recognised as a favorable site for the\nsolar dynamo (cf., e.g., Gilman 1992). The reason why the\nmagnetic field should be concentrated at this site was not\nclear, however. We suggest that the concentration can be accounted for by diamagnetic pumping.\nThe poloidal field in Fig. 5 is also concentrated at the\nbottom. The following consideration shows that somewhere\ninside the sun the poloidal field must be much stronger than\non the surface. The magnitude of the surface poloidal field is\nabout 1-2 Gauss only. If the toroidal field is estimated by its\nmagnitude in sunspots, it is about 1000 times stronger than\nthe surface poloidal field. The solar differential rotation of\nabout 30% can produce in the 11 years of the solar cycle\na toroidal field that is at most 40 times stronger than the\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n5\n\nFig. 6 Butterfly diagram of the depth-integrated toroidal\nfield B of Eq.

D = 2.2 \u00d7 104 .\npoloidal filed (the strong radial shear in the tachocline does\nnot change this estimation because the radial field should be\nas much weaker there compared to the meridional field as\nthe radial shear is larger than the latitudinal shear). Therefore, a poloidal field of several tens Gauss is necessary for\nthe production of kilogauss toroidal fields. The toroidal field\nin our dynamo model is about 1000 times stronger than\nthe polar field due to the near-bottom concentration of the\npoloidal field.\nFigure 6 shows butterfly diagrams for the surface radial\nand deep toroidal fields. The toroidal field diagram shows\nthe isolines of the quantity\nB = sin \u03b8\n\nZ1\n\n\u03c6b (x)B(x) dx,\n\n(20)\n\nxi\n\nto which the Babcock-Leighton surface alpha-effect is proportional. The factor sin \u03b8 in Eq. (20) accounts for the dependence of the length of toroidal flux tubes on latitude (it is\nsupposed that the probability of sunspot production is proportional to the length of the tube).\nThe period of the magnetic cycles of Figures 4 and\n2\n6 equals 0.75R\u2299\n/\u03b70 , that for the diffusivity of \u03b70 \u2248\n13\n2\n10 cm /s is close to the 11 year period of the solar cycle.\nThe model with nonlocal alpha-effect does not suffer from\nthe old problem of too short magnetic cycles typical of the\nlocal dynamo models (Fig. 3).\nThe radial field diagram of Fig. 6 is similar to observational diagrams of Stenflo (1988) and Obridko et al. (2006).\nThe field pattern of Fig. 6 is antisymmetric about the\nequator. The critical dynamo number for excitation of the\ndipolar modes, Dcd = 1.9 \u00d7 104 , is substantially smaller\nc 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f6\n\nL.L. Kitchatinov & S.V. Olemskoy: Alleviation of catastrophic quenching\n\nthan the critical number Dcq = 2.5 \u00d7 104 for the quadrupolar modes. Accordingly, the runs started from an initial field\nof mixed parity rapidly relaxed to dipolar parity. So clear\npreference for the dipolar modes is typical of the dynamo\nmodels with relative small magnetic diffusion near the base\nof the convection zone (Chatterjee, Nandy & Choudhuri\n2004).\nThe only clear disagreement of the model with observations is the presence of toroidal fields in Fig. 6 on too high\nlatitudes. It may be expected that even a slow meridional\nflow in the near-bottom region of low diffusion can influence the latitudinal profile of a toroidal field. Allowance for\nthe meridional flow is a perspective for model improvement.\nAcknowledgements.
