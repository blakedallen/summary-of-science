A purely geometric result [2] for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes (with a well-defined axis of symmetry) admitting one conformal motion\nimplies that both the stationary and the axial Killing vectors necessarily commute with\nthe conformal Killing. Thus, the Lie algebra of the three dimensional conformal group\ncan only adopt four inequivalent forms, which were labeled in [1] as Abelian Case and\nCases I, II and III, and which correspond to\n~ ~k = ~0,\n\u03be,\n\nh\n\nAbelian Case\n\ni\n\n~ ~k = b~k,\n\u03be,\n\nh\n\nCase I\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\n~ ~k = c\u03be,\n~\n\u03be,\n\nh\n\nCase II\n\ni\n\n~ ~k = v~\u03b7,\n\u03be,\n\nh\n\nCase III\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03be~ is the timelike Killing vector, ~\u03b7 is the axial Killing vector, ~k is the conformal\nKilling and b, c and v are arbitrary non-vanishing constants (these constants can be\nnormalised to one, but as they usually carry dimensions we prefer to retain them). In [1]\nthe general solution of Einstein's field equations for the Abelian and Case I was found.\nThe general solution for the Abelian Case depends on an arbitrary function of a single\nvariable and the perfect fluid satisfies the barotropic equation of state \u03c1 = p+const. The\nsolution is Petrov type D and the fluid velocity vector lies in the two plane generated\nat each point by the two repeated principal directions of the Weyl tensor. This solution\nwas first found under completely different hypotheses by one of us [3]. In Case I, the\ngeneral solution is an explicit Petrov type D metric with the fluid velocity vector lying\noutside the two-plane generated by the repeated principal directions and the perfect\nfluid satisfying the barotropic equation of state \u03c1 + 3p = 0. Let us remark here that\n[1] contained an erroneous statement concerning this solution which is corrected at\nthe end of this paper: the fluid velocity vector for this solution was claimed to rotate\ndifferentially when the solution is, actually, rigidly rotating. Then, as a consequence of\nthe results in [5], this solution is contained in the general Wahlquist family [6] of Petrov\ntype D rigidly rotating perfect fluids with equation of state \u03c1 + 3p =const.\nThe Cases II and III were also considered, but the study of solutions was only\nperformed under the severe restriction imposed by an Ansatz of separation of variables\nin one of the metric functions. For the first two cases in (1) this separation of variables\nis a consequence of one of the Einstein field equations but, for the remaining Cases II\nand III, it had to be imposed as an additional assumption in order to handle the field\nequations. The solution under this assumption was found and the conformal Killing\nvector turned out to be, in fact, homothetic.\n2\n\n\fThe aim of this paper is to complete the study performed in [1] by analysing the\ngeneral non-convective differentially rotating perfect-fluid solution of Einstein's field\nequations for a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime with one conformal symmetry\nsuch that the Lie algebra of the conformal group belongs to one of the Cases II or III\nabove. It turns out that there exists one perfect-fluid family of solutions for both cases.\nThe dependence of all metric coefficients of these solutions on one of the coordinates\nis explicit. The dependence on the other non-trivial coordinate can be obtained by\nsolving a remaining compatible system of ordinary differential equations. The general\nsolution of this system depends on an arbitrary function which cannot be reabsorbed\nby any coordinate change. It also results that the conformal Killing for these two\nfamilies is necessarily homothetic which proves that no non-convective stationary and\naxisymmetric perfect fluid admitting one proper conformal motion exists apart from\nthose in [1],[3]. We remark that the families we will find in this paper contain as\nparticular cases the solutions for Cases II and III considered in [1].\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we recall the line-element and the\nform of the conformal Killing for the Lie algebras II and III. We rewrite the metric in\na way which allows us to consider the two cases together. Then we write the Einstein\nfield equations for a perfect-fluid energy-momentum tensor and concentrate our efforts\nin a subsystem constituted by two partial differential equations for a single function\n\u03a8(x, y) (the conformal factor of the metric). In section 3 we find the general solution\nof this system of equations which turns out to be a set of four different families that we\nlabel as Solutions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Section 4 is devoted to impose the remaining Einstein\nequation (which is quadratic in the second derivatives) for each of the four solutions.\nWe prove that Solution 1 does not represent a perfect fluid. Regarding Solutions 2 and\n3, we show that they can be treated together and that the quadratic equation gives rise\nto a system of ordinary differential equations which can be shown to give no solution\nwith a regular axis of symmetry. In an Appendix we proof this statement completely\nfor the Case III and give the main indications regarding the Case II (the proof for this\ncase is much longer but still not difficult to perform). Let us remark here that the\nassumption of regular axis is not an additional one in our work because the restriction\nto the four possible Lie algebras (1) is based essentially on this regularity of the axis\n[1]-[2].\nThen we consider Solution 4, which makes the quadratic equation compatible thus\ngiving perfect-fluid solutions of Einstein's equations which are analysed in Section 5,\nwhere we rewrite the line-elements for these solutions in the simplest forms and write\ndown the remaining ordinary differential equations including a discussion on the compatibility of the system. We also give the expressions for the density and pressure\nand for the fluid velocity vectors. We finish the section by enclosing a table which\nsummarizes all the non-convective stationary and axisymmetric perfect-fluid solutions\nof Einstein's equations admitting one conformal Killing vector. We end this paper by\nincluding a corrigendum for an erroneous statement in [1] concerning the solution in\n3\n\n\fCase I (see above).\n\n2\n\nCanonical forms of the metric and Einstein field\nequations\n\nAs we have stated in the Introduction, we are interested in studying the Einstein field\nequations for a non-convective, differentially rotating perfect fluid in stationary and\naxisymmetric spacetimes admitting one conformal motion such that the conformal algebra belongs to Cases II or III defined above. The canonical form of the metric in\nthese two cases is explicitly given in [1] where it is shown that there exist coordinates\nin which the line-elements and the conformal Killing vectors take the forms\nCase II\n\"\n\n1\n\u2212F\u0303 (x) e\u2212cy dt + P\u0303 (x)d\u03c6\nds = 2\n\u03a8 (x, y)\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nQ\u03032 (x) 2\nd\u03c6 + dx2 + dy 2 ,\n+\nF\u0303 (x)\n#\n\n(2)\n\n~k = ct \u2202 + \u2202 .\n\u2202t \u2202y\nCase III\nQ2 (x)\n1\n\u2212F (x)dt2 +\nds = 2\n\u03a8 (x, y)\nF (x)\n\"\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nd\u03c6 + (P (x) \u2212 vy) dt\n\n2\n\n+ dx + dy\n\n2\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n~k = vt \u2202 + \u2202 .\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202y\nIn both metrics the dependence of the function \u03a8(x, y) on the variable y must be nontrivial because, otherwise, the conformal Killing ~k becomes a true Killing field.\nAs we will see in what follows, it is very convenient to study the two Cases II and\nIII together as they have similar properties. It is obvious that the two line-elements\ncan be fused into the following expression\n\u00112\n1\nQ2 (x) \u0010\nds = 2\n\u2212F (x)e\u22122cy dt2 +\nd\u03c6 + e\u2212cy (P (x) \u2212 vy) dt + dx2 + dy 2 , (4)\n\u03a8 (x, y)\nF (x)\n2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nwhere the expressions relating the functions F\u0303 (x), P\u0303 (x) and Q\u0303(x) with F (x), P (x) and\nQ(x) for Case II can be easily obtained. Case III is recovered by setting c = 0 and Case\nII corresponds to v = 0. Thus, we can set the product cv = 0 wherever it occurs in the\n4\n\n\fcalculation of the Einstein tensor. The orthonormal tetrad that we will use in order to\nwrite the components of the tensor quantities is given by\n\u03b80 =\n\n1 Q\n1 \u221a \u2212cy\nF e dt, \u03b8 1 = \u221a\n\u03a8\n\u03a8 F\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03c6 + e\u2212cy (P \u2212 vy) dt , \u03b8 2 =\n\n1\n1\ndx, \u03b8 3 = dy.\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\nWe are interested in perfect-fluid solutions of the Einstein field equations, so that the\nenergy-momentum tensor takes the following standard form\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03c1 + p) u\u03b1 u\u03b2 + pg\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nwhere \u03c1 and p are the energy density and the pressure of the fluid respectively and ~u\nis the fluid velocity vector. The fluid motion is taken as non-convective, that is to say,\nthe velocity vector ~u lies on the two-plane generated at each point by the two Killing\nvectors \u03be~ and ~\u03b7 . In the above orthonormal tetrad the fluid one-form u is given by\nu20 \u2212 u21 = 1,\n\nu = u0 \u03b8 0 + u1 \u03b8 1 ,\n\nso that the Einstein field equations, in c = 8\u03c0G = 1 units, read\nS00 = (\u03c1 + p) u20 \u2212 p,\nS01 = (\u03c1 + p) u0u1 ,\nS11 = (\u03c1 + p) u21 + p,\nS22 = S33 = p,\nS02 = S03 = S12 = S13 = S23 = 0,\nwhere S\u03b1\u03b2 stands for the components of the Einstein tensor in the {\u03b8 \u03b1} cobasis. Some\nof these equations can be rewritten involving only the Einstein tensor, while the energy\ndensity, pressure and velocity vector are calculated once these equations are solved. Due\nto the separation of the metric into two orthogonal blocks, some of the Einstein tensor\ncomponents are identically vanishing in the tetrad we are considering. Specifically, it\ncan be shown by direct calculation that\nS02 \u2261 0,\n\nS03 \u2261 0,\n\nS12 \u2261 0,\n\nS13 \u2261 0\n\nand consequently, the only non-trivially satisfied Einstein equations are\n2\n(S00 + S22 ) (S11 \u2212 S22 ) \u2212 S01\n= 0,\nS22 \u2212 S33 = 0,\nS23 = 0.\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nWe will now concentrate on the last two equations (6)-(7), which read (after dropping\nsome global non-vanishing factors)\n\u2202xy \u03a8 = H(x)\u03a8,\n\n\u2202xx \u03a8 \u2212 \u2202yy \u03a8 = G(x)\u03a8.\n5\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere the expressions for H(x) and G(x) are\n2\n2\nF\u2032\n1\n\u2032Q\n\u2032Q\ncP P 2 \u2212 c + vP 2 ,\nH(x) =\n4\nF\nF\nF\n\n!\n\nG(x) =\n\n1 F \u2032 2 1 F \u2032 Q\u2032 1 \u2032 2 Q2 1 Q\u2032\u2032 c2 P 2 Q2 c2 v 2 Q2\n\u2212\n\u2212 P\n+\n+\n\u2212 +\n,\n4 F2\n2 FQ\n4\nF2 2 Q\n4 F2\n2\n4 F2\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nthe primes meaning derivatives with respect to x. These equations were studied in [1]\nonly under the simplifying assumption \u03a8 = g(x) + h(y), which obviously corresponds to\nthe vanishing of the function H. Given that this case was completed in the mentioned\npaper, we can assume from now on that H does not vanish identically. In the next\nsection we are going to find the general solution of the system of partial differential\nequations (8) for the function \u03a8(x, y) when H 6= 0.\n\n3\n\nSolution of the system of equations for \u03a8.\n\nIn order to solve the system (8), let us find all the third-order partial derivatives of \u03a8\nwith respect to the variables x and y. Deriving the first of the equations with respect\nto x and with respect to y we immediately get, respectively\n\u2202xxy \u03a8 = H \u2032\u03a8 + H\u2202x \u03a8,\n\n\u2202xyy \u03a8 = H\u2202y \u03a8,\n\n(11)\n\nand considering the derivatives of the second equation we find, after making use of (11)\n\u2202xxx \u03a8 = H\u2202y \u03a8 + G\u2202x \u03a8 + G\u2032 \u03a8,\n\n\u2202yyy \u03a8 = H \u2032\u03a8 + H\u2202x \u03a8 \u2212 G\u2202y \u03a8.\n\n(12)\n\nWe can now impose integrability conditions on this set of partial differential equations.\nFor instance, the difference of the partial derivative of the first equation in (11) with\nrespect to x with the partial derivative of the first equation in (12) with respect to y\ngives the following first order equation\nH \u2032\u2032 \u03a8 + 2H \u2032 \u2202x \u03a8 = G\u2032 \u2202y \u03a8,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the original system (8) has been taken into account. It is easy to see that the\nintegrability condition for the other two equations is given again by (13).\nIf the function G is a constant, then (13) implies that either H is also a constant\nor \u03a8 takes the form of a product of a function of x and a function of y. From (13) it\nalso follows that when H is a constant then G(x) must also be constant (because the\nother possibility \u2202y \u03a8 = 0 needs not be considered as discussed above). Thus, let us\nfirst study the case when both H and G are constants. Since we can assume H 6= 0,\nthe original system (8) implies the following homogeneous equation\n\u2202xx \u03a8 \u2212 \u2202yy \u03a8 \u2212\n\nG\n\u2202xy \u03a8 = 0\nH\n\n6\n\n\fwhich can be immediately solved (given that G and H are constants) to give\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n2\n\n\u03a8 = f1 y \u2212 a Hx + f2\n\n1\ny+ 2 x\naH\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere f1 and f2 are arbitrary functions of their arguments and the positive constant a\nis defined by\n\u221a\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1\n1\u0010\n\u2212G + G2 + 4H 2\n2\n2 + 4H 2 .\nG\n+\n=\u21d2\n=\n(14)\nG\na \u2261\n2H 2\na2\n2\nWith this form for the function \u03a8, the second equation in (8) can be trivially separated\ninto the following two equations\n\u03b1\nf \u03082 = H 2 a2 f2 \u2212\n.\n2H\n\n1\n\u03b1\nf \u03081 = \u2212 2 f1 +\n,\na\n2H\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a separation constant and dots indicate derivatives with respect to their\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nrespective arguments. The redefinitions f1 + 2H\n\u2212\u2192 f1 and f2 \u2212 2H\n\u2212\u2192 f2 , which leave\ninvariant its sum \u03a8 = f1 + f2 , allow us to set the constant \u03b1 = 0. Thus, the solution of\nthe system (15) is clearly\nSolution 1:\n\naHy+ xa\n\n\u03a8 = Ae\n\n\u2212(aHy+ xa )\n\n+ Be\n\ny\n+ C sin\n\u2212 aHx + x0\na\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere A, B, C are arbitrary constants and x0 is a superfluous constant that can be\nreabsorbed into the coordinates. Let us remember that G is obtained in terms of H\nand a from (14).\nWe shall momentarily discard the case when G is a constant and \u03a8 is a product of a\nfunction of x and a function of y because it is contained in a more general situation we\nwill meet later. Let us then consider the general case when G\u2032 6= 0 (and then H \u2032 6= 0).\nDeriving equation (13) with respect to x and using the first equation in (8) we get\n2H \u2032\n\u2202xx \u03a8 +\nG\u2032\n\n\"\n\n2H \u2032\nG\u2032\n\n!\u2032\n\n#\n\nH \u2032\u2032\n+ \u2032 \u2202x \u03a8 +\nG\n\n\"\n\nH \u2032\u2032\nG\u2032\n\n!\u2032\n\n#\n\n\u2212 H \u03a8 = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nThe nice property of this partial differential equation is that all the coefficients and all\nthe derivatives involve only the variable x. Thus, its general solution is\n\u03a8 = A1 (y)v1 (x) + A2 (y)v2 (x),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are arbitrary integration coefficients which can depend on y, and v1 and\nv2 are two linearly independent solutions (so that in particular they are non-vanishing)\nof the ordinary second order differential equation given by the same expression (16)\nwith ordinary derivatives substituted for the partial derivatives. Our aim now is to\n7\n\n\ffind all the solutions of the original system (8) with the form for the function \u03a8 given\nin (17). It is obvious that we will also find all the solutions which are products of a\nfunction of y and a function of x (say by imposing A2 (y) = 0 in (17)), and thus the\ncase G\u2032 = 0 with H \u2032 6= 0 we had left aside is also contained in this study.\nThe first equation in the system (8) for a function \u03a8 of the type (17) takes the form\n\u02261 v1\u2032 + \u02262 v2\u2032 \u2212 A1 Hv1 \u2212 A2 Hv2 = 0,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere dots mean derivative with respect to y from now on. The lefthand side of this\nequation is a linear combination of the four functions of y, \u02261 , \u02262 , A1 and A2 , with\ncoefficients not depending on y. Thus, we can study this equation by considering\nall the possibilities of linear independence of these four functions. First of all, it is\nobvious that the case in which all four functions of y are linearly independent need\nnot be considered as it implies the vanishing of each coefficient in (18) which is clearly\nimpossible. Thus, we can move to the case in which A1 and A2 are linearly independent\nand rank{\u02261 , \u02262 , A1 , A2 } = 3, so that without loss of generality we can consider that\n\u02262 is linearly independent of A1 and A2 and write \u02261 = \u03b21 \u02262 + \u03b22 A1 + \u03b23 A2 , where \u03b21 ,\n\u03b22 , \u03b23 are constants. The equation (18) becomes\nA1 (\u03b22 v1\u2032 \u2212 Hv1 ) + A2 (\u03b23 v1\u2032 \u2212 Hv2 ) + \u02262 (\u03b21 v1\u2032 + v2\u2032 ) = 0,\nso that each term between brackets must vanish. From the coefficient multiplying A1\nand H 6= 0 we have that \u03b22 6= 0 and thus v1\u2032 = Hv1 /\u03b22 . Substituting this value\nof v1\u2032 into the second term in brackets and dropping a global factor H we obviously\nget v2 = \u03b23 v1 /\u03b22 so that the two functions v1 and v2 are linearly dependent which is\nimpossible. Thus, this possibility gives no solution for the function \u03a8 either.\nLet us now consider the next possibility given by A1 and A2 linearly independent\nand rank{\u02261 , \u02262 , A1 , A2 } = 2. Thus, each function \u02261 and \u02262 is a linear combination\nwith constant coefficients of A1 and A2 :\n\u02262 = \u03b221 A1 + \u03b222 A2 .\n\n\u02261 = \u03b211 A1 + \u03b212 A2 ,\n\nWe can redefine the two functions A1 and A2 using arbitrary non-singular linear combinations of themselves because this does not change the form (17) of \u03a8 (obviously, we\nmust redefine the two functions v1 and v2 appropriately). Under such a change, the\ncoefficients \u03b2ab (a, b = 1,2) transform like an endomorphism that can be rewritten in its\ncanonical form. Consequently, the only two inequivalent possibilities that can arise are\n\u02261 = \u03b21 A1\n\u02262 = \u03b22 A2 .\n\n)\n\n\u02261 = \u03b2A1\n\u02262 = A1 + \u03b2A2\n\n,\n\nIn the second case, equation (18) takes the form\nA1 (\u03b2v1\u2032 \u2212 Hv1 + v2\u2032 ) + A2 (\u03b2v2\u2032 \u2212 Hv2 ) = 0\n8\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhich implies that each term enclosed in round brackets must vanish. Again \u03b2 must\nbe non-vanishing so that we can set \u03b2 = \u03b11 . The solutions for v1 and v2 are trivially\nv1 = r(x)e\u03b1r(x) ,\n\nv2 = \u2212\n\n1 \u03b1r(x)\ne\n,\n\u03b12\n\nr \u2032 = H,\n\nwith\n\nwhile the solutions for A1 and A2 are\ny\n\ny\n\nA1 = Ae \u03b1 ,\n\nA2 = A (y \u2212 y0 ) e \u03b1 ,\n\nwhere A 6= 0 and y0 are constants. Obviously, we can reabsorbe y0 into the variable y.\nFinally, by imposing the second equation in (8) and using the above results we obtain\nthe following two equations\n3\n2\n2\n= 0,\nG + \u03b12 r \u2032 + 2 = 0.\n(20)\n3\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nThe first equation gives r(x) explicitly (and thereby the function H(x) after derivation),\nand the second gives G(x). Thus, both of them are differential relations for the unknown\nmetric coefficients F (x), Q(x) and P (x). Summing up, we have\nr \u2032\u2032 + 2\u03b1r \u20322 +\n\ny\n\ny\n\u03b12\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a8 = Ae\u03b1r(x)+ \u03b1 r(x) \u2212\n\nSolution 2:\n\n\u0013\n\nwith H = r \u2032\n\nand the two relations (20) must hold.\nWe must now consider the possibility given by the first set of differential relations\nin (19). Using these equations, the relation (18) takes the form\nA1 (\u03b21 v1\u2032 \u2212 Hv1 ) + A2 (\u03b22 v2\u2032 \u2212 Hv2 ) = 0,\nso that again each term in brackets must vanish. As neither v1 nor v2 can be zero,\nwe have that the constants \u03b21 and \u03b22 are non-vanishing so that we can rename them\nrespectively as \u03b111 and \u03b112 . The equations for \u02261 \u02262 , v1\u2032 and v2\u2032 allow us to write the\nfinal form of \u03a8 immediately as\n\u03b11 r(x)+ \u03b1y\n\nSolution 3:\n\n\u03a8 = Ae\n\n1\n\n\u03b12 r(x)+ \u03b1y\n\n+ Be\n\n2\n\n,\n\nH = r\u2032\n\n(with \u03b11 6= \u03b12 in order to have A1 linearly independent of A2 ). The second equation of\n(8) is equivalent now to the two equations:\n\u03b11 + \u03b12\n= 0,\n\u03b112 \u03b122\n\n2\n\nr \u2032\u2032 + (\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) r \u2032 +\n\n2\n\nG + \u03b11 \u03b12 r \u2032 +\n\n1\n1\n1\n+ 2+\n= 0.\n2\n\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b11 \u03b12\n\n(21)\n\nIt is convenient to note here that the constants \u03b11 , \u03b12 , A and B can be complex still\ngiving a real function \u03a8. This can be accomplished only when \u03b11 = \u03b1 + i\u03b2, \u03b12 = \u03b11 ,\nA = B where the bar means complex conjugation. In this case the function \u03a8 becomes\n\u03b1r(x)+\n\n\u03a8 = Ae\n\n\u03b1\ny\n\u03b12 +\u03b2 2\n\n\u03b2\nsin \u03b2r(x) \u2212 2\ny + x0\n\u03b1 + \u03b22\n9\n\n!\n\n\fwhere x0 is a constant that can be made zero by redefining the variable x.\nLet us finally consider the case when the two functions A1 (y) and A2 (y) are linearly\ndependent. Due to the symmetry in the indexes 1 and 2 we can choose A2 proportional\nto A1 , A2 (y) = \u03bbA1 (y) where \u03bb is an arbitrary constant. The form of the function \u03a8 is\nnow\n\u03a8(x, y) = A1 (y) [v1 (x) + \u03bbv2 (x)] \u2261 A1 (y)X(x)\nso that it is the product of a function of only x and a function of only y. The first\nequation in (8) is now\nX \u2032 \u02261 = H(x)XA1\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u02261 =\n\n1\nA1 ,\n\u03b1\n\nX \u2032 = \u03b1HX\n\nfor some non-vanishing separation constant \u03b1. The second equation of the system (8)\nbecomes (after dropping a global factor \u03a8)\n2\n\nG(x) \u2212 \u03b1r \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b12 r \u2032 +\n\n1\n= 0.\n\u03b12\n\n(22)\n\nThus, the final possibility for the system (8) is given by\nSolution 4:\n\ny\n\n\u03a8 = Ae\u03b1r(x)+ \u03b1 ,\n\nr\u2032 = H\n\ntogether with the differential equation (22).\n\n4\n\nAnalysis of the remaining Einstein equation\n\nHaving found all the possible solutions of the system (8), we must now impose the\nquadratic equation (5) on each one of these possibilities in order to find which of them\ngive rise to a perfect-fluid solution of Einstein's equations. In order to deal with the\nmentioned quadratic equation it is worth considering it as the vanishing of the norm of\na three-dimensional vector with components\n~ \u2261 (S00 + S33 , S11 \u2212 S22 , S01 )\nS\nin a three-dimensional vector space endowed with a scalar product given by\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\uf8ec 1\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8ed 2 0\n0 0 \u22121\n0\n\n10\n\n(23)\n\n\fThis quadratic form has signature (1, \u22121, \u22121), and therefore, equation (5) states that\nthe vector (23) is null in this indefinite scalar product.

Let us begin by what we have named Solution 1.\nSolution 1 As convenient notation let us define the following three functions of the\ntwo variables x and y\naHy+ xa\n\nk1 (x, y) \u2261 e\n\n,\n\ny\n\u2212 aHx ,\nk2 (x, y) \u2261 sin\na\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\ny\nk3 (x, y) \u2261 cos\n\u2212 aHx ,\na\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nso that \u03a8 is written as \u03a8 = Ak1 + B/k1 + Ck2 . If in this expression C vanished, the\nsolution would in fact belong to Solution 3. Similarly, if both A and B vanished, the\nsolution would be also contained in Solution 3. In consequence, we must have C 6= 0\nand at least one of the A and B non-zero. By using the change a \u2192 \u2212a we can obviously\nassume A and C non-vanishing in what follows without loss of generality .\nBy taking the derivatives of the function \u03a8, the vector (23) becomes\n~\nS\n~ 2 + Ck2 X\n~ 3 + Ck3 X\n~4,\n~1 + 1 X\n= Ak1 X\n\u03a8\nk1\n\n(24)\n\n~ j (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4) depend only on x and are given by\nwhere the four vectors X\n~ 1 = R1 + R2 + 2a2 H 2 + 2caH, M1 + M2 \u2212 2a2 H 2 , L1 + L2 + aHL3 ,\nX\na\na\na\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n11\n\n\f~ 2 = B R1 \u2212 R2 + 2a2 H 2 \u2212 2caH, M1 \u2212 M2 \u2212 2a2 H 2 , L1 \u2212 L2 \u2212 aHL3 ,\nX\na\na\na\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\n~ 3 = R1 \u2212 , M1 + , L1 ,\nX\na2\na2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~ 4 = 2c \u2212 aHR2 , \u2212aHM2 , \u2212aHL2 + L3 ,\nX\na\na\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n~ 2 because B is the only constant that can vanish.

Thus, we must\n~1 * X\n~ 2 = 0 and every scalar product of each vector X\n~ i with each X\n~j\nnecessarily have X\nmust vanish. Therefore, all these four vectors are proportional to some null vector and,\nas an obvious consequence, we have that the linear combination\n~1 \u2212 X\n~3 +\nX\n\n1 ~\n1\nX4 = a2 H 2 + 2\n2\n2\naH\na\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u0012\n\n2+2\n\nc\nL3\n, \u22122,\naH\naH\n\n\u0013\n\nhas to be also a null vector, that is to say\nL3 2\n4c\n+\n= 0,\n4+\naH a2 H 2\nfrom which we learn that c cannot vanish. Consequently, Case III is impossible and we\ncan set v = 0, so that from the definition of L3 we have L3 = \u2212c QP\n. The equation above\nF\nshows that L3 must be constant so that every vector Xi is proportional to the constant\n~ 4 with\nnull vector (2 + 2c/aH, \u22122, L3 /aH). In particular, from the proportionality of X\nthis vector and the fact that H is actually a constant in Solution 1, it immediately\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfollows that FF and QQ are also constants. Now, it is very easy to find the most general\nsolution of Einstein's equations in this case, given by the following functions\nx\n2\nF F\u2032\ny\nQ\u2032\n= , P =\u01eb ,\n= \u03b3 c = \u22122aH, \u03a8 = AeaHy+ a + C sin\n\u2212 aHx .\nQ\na\nQ F\na\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a sign and \u03b3 an arbitrary constant. The Einstein tensor for the metric (4)\nwith these explicit forms for the functions F , Q, P and \u03a8 takes the following form\nS00 + S22 = S11 \u2212 S22 = \u2212\u01ebS01 ,\n\n\u0012\n\nS22 = S33 = 3C 2 a2 H 2 +\n12\n\n1\n,\na2\n\u0013\n\nS23 = 0.\n\n\fThus, it is clear that the Einstein field equations (5), (6) and (7) are satisfied. However\nthis metric does not represent a perfect fluid because the fluid velocity vector is not defined. The reason is that the quadratic equation (5) states exactly that the determinant\nof the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\nS00 + S22\nS01\nS01\nS11 \u2212 S22\n\n!\n\nvanishes. This is in turn equivalent to the existence of two functions U0 and U1 such\nthat\nS00 + S22\nS01\nS01\nS11 \u2212 S22\n\n!\n\n=\u03c3\n\nU02 U0 U1\nU0 U1 U12\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the sign of the component S00 +S11 (if it vanishes then \u03c3 is the sign of S11 \u2212S22 ,\nif both are zero then the whole matrix is vanishing). When these two functions U0 and\nU1 satisfy\nU02 \u2212 U12 > 0\nwe can normalise this \"vector\" and define the two components u0 and u1 of the fluid\nvelocity vector as\n\u03c3U02 \u2261 (\u03c1 + p) u20 ,\n\n\u03c3U12 \u2261 (\u03c1 + p) u21 ,\n\nwith\n\nu20 \u2212 u21 = 1.\n\nThese expressions also define \u03c1+p. However, other possibilities may also happen. First,\nthere exist solutions of the quadratic equation (5) which satisfy\nU02 \u2212 U12 < 0.\nThis case would correspond to a perfect-fluid-like Einstein tensor but with the \"fluid\"\nvelocity being spacelike and thus it has no physical interest as it does not describe any\nknown matter. Finally, there exist solutions satisfying\nU02 \u2212 U12 = 0,\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nS00 + S22 = S11 \u2212 S22 .\n\nIn this case the Einstein tensor is of the form\nS\u03b1\u03b2 = K\u03b1 K\u03b2 + pg\u03b1\u03b2\n~ is a null vector lying in the two plane spanned by the Killings \u2202t and \u2202\u03c6 .\nwhere K\nThus, this solution represents a radiative fluid with pressure. So, we conclude that\nthe quadratic equation (5) contains solutions which do not represent perfect-fluids and\nthat this must be checked after having found the solution. It is clear now that the\nsolution (25) belongs to this class of radiative fluids with pressure and thus will not be\nconsidered here any further. We can now move to the following solution given by\n13\n\n\fSolutions 2 and 3 Let us define the function\nW (x, y) \u2261 r(x) \u2212\n\ny\n\u03b12\ny\n\n\u03b1r(x)+ \u03b1\nso that \u03a8 for Solution 2 is written\nW .

At this stage, however, it is convenient to study the possibility given by\nSolution 3 rather than studying this system of equations because, as we will see, the\ntwo systems of equations for Solutions 2 and 3 can be treated together.\nFor Solution 3 it is worth defining the two functions\n\u03b11 r(x)+ \u03b1y\n\n\u03a81 (x, y) = e\n\n1\n\n,\n\n\u03b12 r(x)+ \u03b1y\n\n\u03a82 (x, y) = e\n\n2\n\n,\n\nso that \u03a8 is written as \u03a8 = A\u03a81 + B\u03a82 , where A and B are non-vanishing constants\nand \u03b11 6= \u03b12 .h Taking the partial\ni derivatives of the function \u03a8, the vector (23) takes the\n~\n~\n~\nform S = \u03a8 A\u03a81 Z1 + B\u03a82 Z2 , where the two vectors Z~1 (x) and Z~2 (x) are\n!\n\n2\n2\n2c\nL3\nZ~1 = R1 + \u03b11 r \u2032 R2 + 2 + , M1 + \u03b11 r \u2032 M2 \u2212 2 , L1 + \u03b11 r \u2032 L2 +\n,\n\u03b11 \u03b11\n\u03b11\n\u03b11\n!\n2c\n2\nL3\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~\n.\nZ2 = R1 + \u03b12 r R2 + 2 + , M1 + \u03b12 r M2 \u2212 2 , L1 + \u03b12 r L2 +\n\u03b12 \u03b12\n\u03b12\n\u03b12\n\nAs \u03a821 , \u03a81 \u03a82 and \u03a822 are linearly independent functions of y, it follows that the quadratic\nequation (5) is equivalent to the vanishing of all the scalar products of Z~1 and Z~2 so that\nboth vectors must be proportional to some null vector. Of course any linear combination\nof them has also the same property.

Thus, by studying the compatibility of system\n(27)-(32) we are considering both Solutions 2 and 3 together and thereby we have\nreduced considerably the amount of work to be done. By assuming that the resulting\nspacetime has a well-defined axis of symmetry we can expand the functions involved\nin this system around the axis of symmetry and check the compatibility of this system\nof differential equations. In the Appendix we show that that the system (27)-(32) has\nno solution giving rise to a spacetime with regular axis of symmetry. Let us emphasize\nthat this assumption of regular axis is not an additional condition in our work because\nthe restriction of the possible Lie algebras to the four cases listed in the Introduction is\nbased on a geometrical result proven in [2] which makes essential use of this regularity\nproperty.\nSolution 4 This last case is the most interesting one because it gives rise to a family\nof stationary non-convective differentially rotating perfect-fluid solutions. In fact, from\ny\nthe explicit form of \u03a8 = Ae\u03b1r(x)+ \u03b1 the vector (23) takes the form\n~ = A\u03a82 R1 + \u03b1r \u2032 R2 + 2 + 2c , M1 + \u03b1r \u2032 M2 \u2212 2 , L1 + \u03b1r \u2032 L2 + L3 ,\nS\n\u03b12\n\u03b1\n\u03b12\n\u03b1\nso that the condition that this vector is null gives only one condition for the three\nfunctions F , Q and P . Besides, we know that for this Solution 4, H and G had to\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n15\n\n\fsatisfy only the two relations H = r \u2032 and (22), with no relation involving only r. Thus,\nthe Einstein field equations reduce to a system of three ordinary differential equations\nfor the four unknowns r, F , Q and P . We devote the following section to consider these\nperfect-fluid solutions.\n\n5\n\nThe solutions\n\nIn order to write down explicitly the field equations and the density and pressure for\nthe family just found, let us rewrite the line-element in a separate way for the Cases II\nand III.

(36)\n\n\fwhere A(x) and R(x) are rather long expressions depending on the functions F , Q, P\nand L. We note that the solution is differentially rotating except when R(x) \u2261 0, which\ncorresponds to the case when both the second and third terms in square brackets in the\nlast equation are vanishing.\nThe system of equations (34)-(36) is formed by three ordinary differential equations\nfor four unknowns so that, in principle, it contains an arbitrary function in its general\nsolution. However, the third equation in the system is quadratic so that the compatibility of the system is not obvious at first sight. In order to see explicitly that the system\nis indeed compatible and contains an arbitrary function, let us define a new function\nM(x) by\n\u221a\nQ M\nF \u2261\n.\nP\nThus, we are assuming P 6= 0 (the case P \u2261 0 will be dealt with below). Notice that\nwhen P is non-zero we can always make it positive (locally) by using the coordinate\nchange \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. Now, we define three new functions u(x), s(x) and w(x) by\nQ\u2032\n\u2261 u,\nQ\n\nP\u2032\n\u2261 s,\nP\n\nL\u2032\n\u2261 w.\nL\n\nWe will consider M as the arbitrary function so that the system gives differential equations for u, s and w. First of all we notice that the case M \u2261 1 gives a solution which is\nnot a perfect fluid (see the discussion above) and, therefore, we can assume M 6= 1 from\nnow on. From equation (34) we obtain u and substitute it into the other two equations.\nThen, (35) allows us to obtain s\u2032 in terms of the rest of the functions. Substituting into\n(36) we obtain an expression of the form\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nw \u2032 (M \u2212 1) 4b2 \u2212 4b + M + w \u2032\u03a31 (M, M \u2032 M \u2032\u2032 , w, s) + \u03a32 (M, M \u2032 , M \u2032\u2032 , w, s) = 0.\nWhen M \u2261 4b\u22124b2 the system (35)-(36) is linear in their two highest derivatives (w \u2032, s\u2032 )\nand therefore the existence theorems apply. In the more general case M 6= 4b \u2212 4b2 ,\nwe have to solve w \u2032 from this quadratic equation to obtain a system which is linear\nin their highest derivatives. This can be done unless the discriminant of this equation\nis negative. Evaluating this discriminant we notice that contains both positive and\nnegative terms so that it is not negative definite for all M and all initial conditions. In\ngeneral, there will be functions M and initial conditions for n and s (as well as for the\nconstant b) which make the discriminant positive thus giving solutions to the system.\nJust to give an explicit very particular example (they are trivial to construct), the value\nb = 1, the initial conditions w |x=0= 0, s |x=0 and any function M with M |x=0 = 1/2,\nM \u2032 |x=0 = 0 and M \u2032\u2032 |x=0 = 0 give a positive discriminant and produce a well-defined\nsolution. Thus, we conclude that, even though we cannot prescribe the function M\n17\n\n\ffreely, the general solution of the system (34)-(36) contains an arbitrary function M\nbelonging to a suitable open subset of the whole class of C 2 functions.\nLet us now consider what happens when P \u2261 0 (which corresponds to the static\nlimit of the family). It is indeed very simple to show that the equations can be rewritten\nin this case in the form\nF\u2032\nL\u2032\n\u2261 w(x) 6= 0,\n= 2 (2b \u2212 1) w,\nL\nF\n2\nw \u2032\u2032 8b2 \u2212 4b \u2212 1 \u2032 (2b2 \u2212 1)\n+\nw +\nw\nb\u22121\n(b \u2212 1)2\n\nQ\u2032\nw \u2032 (2b \u2212 1)2\n=\n+\nw,\nQ\nw\nb\u22121\n\n(b 6= 1)\ni\n\nh\n\n(2b \u2212 1)2 w 2 + (b \u2212 1)2 c2 = 0\n\n(37)\n\n(the case w = 0 is slightly different and can be integrated completely to give a solution\nwhich contains more symmetry).

We note that in this case the solution is always differentially rotating (its\nrigidly rotating limit must satisfy v = 0 and thus it actually belongs to the case when\nthe conformal Lie algebra is abelian).

Given that the equations\nare simpler, the analysis is easier than before. We simply need to define a new function\nN(x) by\nQ \u2261 FN\nand regard N as the arbitrary function in the system. Introducing two new functions\ns(x) and w(x) by\nF\u2032\n\u2261 s,\nF\n\nL\u2032\n\u2261 w,\nL\n\nwe notice that (39) allows us to obtain P \u2032 in terms of N and w. Substituting into\nthe other two equations we find that (40) contains s\u2032 linearly and no other derivatives\n(except for N). Substituting s\u2032 obtained from this equation into the last one we find,\nsimilarly as as before,\n4b2\n2\n1 + 2 w \u2032 + \u03a31 (N, N \u2032 , N \u2032\u2032 , w, s) w \u2032 + \u03a32 (N, N \u2032 , N \u2032\u2032 , w, s) = 0.\nN\n!\n\nEvaluating the discriminant of this quadratic equation it can be seen that it is not\nnegative definite. Thus, there exist initial conditions and functions N which make it\npositive. A trivial example is given now by s |x=0 = 0, w |x=0 = 0, b = 1/2 and any\nfunction N satisfying N |x=0 = 1, N \u2032 |x=0= 0 and N \u2032\u2032 |x=0 = 0. Therefore, the general\nsolution of the system (39)-(41) will contain an arbitrary function belonging to some\nopen non-empty subset of the class of C 2 functions.\nIt is interesting to note also that the conformal Killing of all these solutions (both\nfor algebra II and algebra III) is in fact homothetic as it satisfies\nL~k g\u03bc\u03bd = 2bcg\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(Case II),\n\nL~k g\u03bc\u03bd = 2bvg\u03bc\u03bd\n19\n\n(Case III),\n\n\fso that the scale factor is a constant. Thus, the barotropic equation of state of the\nperfect fluid, in case it exists, must be a linear relation of the form p = (\u03b3 + 1) \u03c1 for\nsome constant \u03b3 (see [4]). As the families of solutions contain an arbitrary function,\nthere always exist solutions satisfying this barotropic equation of state.\nLet us finally summarize the main results of this paper and Ref.[1] in the following\ntable where the solutions of Einstein's field equations for stationary and axisymmetric\nspace-times with a (non-isometric) conformal motion (proper for the Abelian Case and\nCase I, but homothetic for the remaining Cases II and III) and filled with a nonconvective perfect fluid are written down.\n\u03a8,x 6= 0\n\nSchwarzschild interior solution\n\n\u03a8,x = 0\n\u03a8,x 6= 0\n\nSolution in [3]\nSchwarzschild interior solution\n\n\u03a8,x = 0\n\nSolution in [1]\n\nCase II\n\n\u03a8,y = \u2212bc\u03a8\n\nSolution (33)\n\nCase III\n\n\u03a8,y = \u2212bv\u03a8\n\nSolution (38)\n\nAbelian Case\n\nCase I\n\nCorrigendum to paper [1]\nLet us end this paper by adding a corrigendum to our previous paper [1]. The general\nsolution for the Case I was explicitly found there. However, the expression for the fluid\nvelocity vector (the expression following formula (27) in [1]) is wrong and should read\n\u2202\n1\n~u = q\n\u03b2 \u1e22 2 \u2212 H 2 \u03c9 2X 2 \u2202t\nwhich implies that the rotation \u03a9 of the fluid is constant. Thus the general perfect\nfluid solution in Case I is rigidly rotating contrarily to what was stated in [1]. As a\nconsequence, we have that this solution must be contained in the general Wahlquist\nfamily [6] which is the general solution (together with its limit cases [8][9][5]) for Petrov\ntype D stationary and axisymmetric rigidly rotating perfect fluids with equation of\nstate \u03c1 + 3p =const. (see [5]).\n\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe present work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n\ny Ciencia under project No. PB93-1050. M. Mars wishes to thank the Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n y Ciencia for financial support.\nAll the tensors in this paper have been computed with the algebraic computer programs CLASSI and REDUCE. The calculations involved in the proof of incompatibility\nof the system of differential equations (27)-(32) have been performed with the essential\nhelp of REDUCE.\n\n6\n\nAppendix\n\nThe aim of this Appendix is to show that the overdetermined system of ordinary differential equations (27)-(32) has no solution representing an axially symmetric spacetime\nwith a well-defined axis of symmetry. First of all, we need to find the conditions on the\nmetric functions F , P and Q such that the metric (4) has well-defined axial symmetry. Thus, we must impose the existence of a two-dimensional surface where the axial\nKilling vector \u2202\u03c6 vanishes and where the so-called elementary flatness condition (see\ne.g. [10]) is fulfilled. A trivial calculation shows that these conditions are equivalent to\nthe existence of a finite value of x (which can be redefined to x = 0 using a coordinate\nchange x \u2212\u2192 x + const.) where\nQ |x=0 = 0,\n\nF |x=0 = 1\n\nand\n\nQ\u2032 |x=0 = 1\n\n(43)\n\n(in order to find these expressions we have also made use of the coordinate freedom of\nrescaling the coordinate t). We must now expand the metric functions around x = 0\nand show that the system of ordinary equations (27)-(32) is incompatible. The first\nthing we notice is that the equation (27) for r can be completely integrated to give\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03b11 + \u03b12\n\u2032\nr =\u2212\ntan\n(x \u2212 x0 )\nif \u03b11 + \u03b12 6= 0,\n\u03b11 \u03b12\n\u03b11 \u03b12\nr \u2032 = const 6= 0\nif \u03b11 + \u03b12 = 0.\nIn the second case we assume the constant r \u2032 to be non-zero because otherwise the\nequation (28) gives H = 0 which belongs to another case. Now, a very simple analysis\nof the function \u03a8 (which is given by Solution 2 or Solution 3) shows that r \u2032 must be\nfinite at x = 0 in order to obtain\nmetric at the axis of symmetry x = 0.\n\u0010 a non-singular\n\u0011\n\u03c0\n2\nx\n=\n6\n\u00b1\n+\n\u03c0n\n,\n(n\nbeing\nan integer). This result is necessary\nThis implies that \u03b1\u03b111+\u03b1\n\u03b12 0\n2\nin order to consider properly the different powers in x of the equations.\nWe must now consider separately the case III from the case II. The first one (c =\n0, v 6= 0) is simpler to study and the proof is as follows. First, we obtain\nP\u2032 =\n\n4r \u2032 F 2\nv Q2\n21\n\n\ffrom the equation (28) and substitute this expression everywhere so that only the\nfunctions F , Q and r \u2032 are present in the equations. We define a new function w(x) by\nQ \u2261 xw(x) so that w(0) = 1 (see (43)). The coefficient in x\u22122 of equation (32) gives\nsimply\n\u2212\n\n16 \u2032 4\nr |x=0 = 0,\nv2\n\nwhich implies from the expression for r \u2032 above that x0 = 0 and \u03b11 + \u03b12 6= 0. Now, the\ncoefficients in x\u22121 of equation (29) and (31) read, respectively\n1\n\u2212 [F \u2032 |x=0 \u22122w \u2032 |x=0] = 0,\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2032\n[F |x=0 \u22124w \u2032 |x=0 ] = 0\n\u03b112 \u03b122\n\nso that obviously F \u2032 |x=0= 0 and w \u2032 |x=0 = 0. Using these expressions the coefficient in\nx\u22122 of (30) reads\n16 (\u03b11 + \u03b12 )2\n=0\n\u2212 2\nv\n\u03b114 \u03b124\nwhich is impossible and we have shown that no regular solutions around the axis of\nsymmetry exist for the case III.\nRegarding the case II (c 6= 0, v = 0), the proof is more involved because the equations\nare more complicated. The idea is, however, the same as in the previous case. Now it\nis convenient to define a new function M(x) by\nPQ\nF =\u221a ,\nM\n\n(44)\n\nwhich allows us to write (28) in the form\n1 M \u2032 Q\u2032 4r \u2032\n1\nP\u2032\n\u2212\n=\n+\n+\nP\nM \u22121\n2M\nQ\nc\n\n!\n\n(45)\n\u2032\n\n(the subcase M \u2261 1 can be easily shown to be impossible) and substitute PP everywhere\nso that only the functions Q, M and r \u2032 appear in the system. We have to take into\naccount, however, that we still do not know the behaviour of the function M near\nx = 0 because the regularity on the axis of symmetry does not tell us anything about\nthe function P (and therefore about M through its definition), except that QP must\nbe finite at x = 0 (because the norm of the timelike Killing \u2202t must be finite and\nnegative on the axis of symmetry) and, therefore, the function M must be regular at\nx = 0. Our next aim is to show that necessarily r \u2032 |x=0 = 0 (or, equivalently, x0 = 0 and\n\u03b11 + \u03b12 6= 0). Let us suppose, on the contrary, that r \u2032 |x=0 6= 0 (but finite as discussed\n22\n\n\fabove). Again we define the function w(x) by Q \u2261 xw(x) and substitute everywhere.\nThe coefficient in x\u22122 of (32) gives\n2\n\n\u2212M |x=0 r \u2032 |x=0 = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\nM |x=0 = 0\n\nand using this information, the coefficient in x\u22123 of (30) gives M \u2032 |x=0 = 0 and then the\ncoefficient in x\u22122 in (31) gives M \u2032\u2032 |x=0= 0. Thus, we have that M has a zero of order\nn \u2265 3 at x = 0 which implies from its definition (44) that P has a zero of order n2 \u2212 1,\nbut then the expression (45) is impossible in the limit x = 0 and we have proven that\nr \u2032 |x=0= 0.\nIt is convenient to perform the change of variables\n#\n\n\"\n\n(\u03b11 + \u03b12 )\nx ,\nu = \u2212 tan\n\u03b11 \u03b12\nso thar r \u2032 = \u03b111\u03b12 u and the axis of symmetry is located at u = 0. Now, expanding\nM and w around u = 0 it is not difficult to show that the system of equations is\nincompatible. The calculations are, however, long and the use of computer algebra is\nneeded. Moreover, a number of different subcases arise so that the proof is lengthy and\ncannot be reproduced here. Let us simply give the main indications for the proof. It is\nenough to restrict the analysis to the three simplest equations (29), (31) and (32) and\nit is convenient to redefine the constants to\n\u03b11 \u2261\n\n1\n,\nK \u2212 K2\n\n\u03b12 \u2261\n\n1\nK2\n\nand define a function n(x) through\nQ\u2032\n(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) n\n=\u2212\n.\nQ\n\u03b112 \u03b122 r \u2032\nFinally, the system of equations takes a much simpler form by performing the following\ncombination\nEquation1 \u2261 4r \u20322 (29) \u2212 (32),\n\"\n#\n\u03b11 + \u03b12\n\u20322\n\u2032 d(32)\n\u20322\nEquation2 \u2261 2r (31) + r\n\u2212 2 r (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 ) +\n(n \u2212 1) (32),\ndx\n\u03b112 \u03b122\nEquation3 \u2261 (32).\nThe first of these equations contains M linearly and without derivatives of M. This\nallows us to substitute M from that equation into the two others so that we have two\nequations for the single function n(u). The analysis now is lengthy but trivial.\n\n23\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Mars M and Senovilla J M M (1994) Class. Quantum Grav. 11 3049\n[2] Mars M and Senovilla J M M (1993) Class.
