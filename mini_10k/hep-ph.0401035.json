look at three frontiers of high-energy physics, illustrating how important\nparts of our current thinking evolved from earlier explorations at preceding frontiers.\n\nElucidating the basic nature of the strong interaction was a vast enterprise to which many\ngifted scientists devoted their best efforts and made wonderful contributions. While the\nsubject is far from finished \u2013 the dramatic developments I'll be discussing this afternoon\n[1] bring that home! \u2013 I think it is clear that the foundations are secure. QCD, as the\nbasic theory, is here to stay. It is a marvelous theory, which cleanly embodies mathematical\nideas of great depth and beauty. Above all QCD demonstrates, in a unique way, the\npower of relativistic quantum field theory to produce an amazing wealth of phenomena\n(asymptotic freedom, jets, confinement, mass generation, resonance spectroscopy, chiral\nsymmetry breaking, anomaly dynamics, ...) in harmony with the observed facts of Nature.\nDavid Gross has just described for you the whirlwind of events and discoveries that led us\nto propose this theory for the strong interaction, reinforced with concrete reasons to believe\nin it (and no other!), and packaged with proposals for critical, quantitative experimental\ntests. I don't want to repeat the details, but only want to endorse what David has already\nemphasized, that he and I were fortunate indeed to be in a position to leverage a vast\naccumulation of knowledge and technique built up by a big international community of\nscientists over decades of dedicated work, much of it frustrating and not properly recognized.\nAs members of this community we should all be proud of our joint achievement.\nI'll freely admit that back in 1973 I didn't begin to anticipate the progress in experiment\nand theory that would bring our subject to the level where it is today. I had some hope\nthat deep inelastic scattering experiments and perhaps measurements of electron-positron\nannihilation (the total cross section) would be made more precise, maybe precise enough\nthat with careful analysis one would see hints of scaling deviations in the form we predicted,\nand thereby gradually build up a case for the correctness of QCD. Of course, reality has\nfar outrun these expectations. One of the great joys of my life in physics has been to\nparticipate in the process \u2013 something like parenthood \u2013 whereby unshaped concepts mature\nin surprising ways into concrete realities, which then engender new visions. I'd like briefly\nto share with you three examples, in each case mixing a little nostalgia with pointers to the\nfuture.\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nSpeech in acceptance of European Physical Society prize for high energy physics, Aachen, August 2003.\nwilczek@mit.edu\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nFrom Running Coupling to Quantitative Unification to\nSupersymmetry\n\nRunning of gauge theory couplings, and in particular the peculiar anti-screening behavior we\ncall asymptotic freedom, was first established by straight unguided calculation [2, 3]. It was\nfirst applied to renormalization group equations for deep Euclidean Green's functions and\nWilson coefficients in operator product expansions, enabled through a rather cumbersome\nformalism to describe a very few physical processes [4, 5, 6]. Before long antiscreening\nwas understood in terms accessible to intuition [7]. And by now of course we've learned\nto exploit the concept much more boldly and confidently, and with great success. Quark\nand gluon degrees of freedom are identified directly in the energy-momentum flow of jets,\nand their basic couplings are made manifest in the iconic three-jet processes seen at LEP.\nComparing the frequency of such events, at different energies, exhibits the running in as\nclear and elementary a form as one could ask for.\nThe calculation of running, of course, extends immediately to electroweak interactions.\n(Indeed, my original interest in it largely arose from this angle.) It was put to brilliant use in\nthe famous work of Georgi, Quinn, and Weinberg [8], who indicated through its use dreams\nabout unification of interactions (Pati and Salam [9], Georgi and Glashow [10]) could be\nbrought down to earth. One could check concretely whether the observed, unequal couplings\nmight result from running a single coupling from ultra-short to accessible distances. A few\nyears later Dimopoulos, Raby, and I realized [11] (to my great surprise, initially) that\nincluding the effects of low-energy supersymmetry, which is quite a drastic expansion of\nthe physics, makes only comparatively small changes in the predictions that emerge from\nthis sort of calculation. Precision experiments and improved calculations appear to endorse\nthese dreams and ideas, in their supersymmetric version.\nUnless this is a cruel tease on the part of Mother Nature, it means we can look forward\nto a lot of fun exploring supersymmetry, and maybe some aspects of unification, at the LHC.\nAn especially poetic possibility is to explore the possibility that other sorts of parameters,\nbesides gauge couplings, derive by running from a unified value [12]. It is widely speculated\nthat the masses of different sorts of gauginos, or of squarks and sleptons, might be related\nin this way.\n\n2\n\nFrom Dark Momentum to Gluonization to Higgs and Dark\nMatter\n\nFeynman interpreted the famous SLAC experiments on deep inelastic scattering using an\nintuitive model of nucleons that postulated point-like particles (partons) as nucleon constituents and treated their dynamics in a crude impulse approximation, ignoring both interactions and quantum interference [13]. Identifying the partons as quarks, and building the\nweak and electromagnetic currents by minimal coupling to quarks, led to many successful\npredictions [14]. There was, however, one clear failure. The momentum carried by quarks\ninside a fast-moving proton does not add up to the total momentum of the proton, in fact\nit is less than half.\nToday's \"dark matter\" problem in astronomy is reminiscent of this old \"dark momen2\n\n\ftum\" problem. In the formal treatments of deep inelastic scattering, the analogy becomes\neerily precise. In that framework, the (failed) sum rule expresses the equality of the full\nenergy-momentum tensor with the energy-momentum tensor constructed from quarks [5, 6].\nWhere electroweak currents see just quarks, gravitons see more! We realized early on\n[5, 6] that the color gluons of QCD, which are electroweak singlets but do carry energymomentum, would enable us to keep the good predictions while losing the bad one. Evidently the gluons had to be major, though \"dark\" (or better: invisible), constituents of the\nproton.\nOur analysis of deep inelastic scattering, which followed pioneering ideas of Wilson [15],\nand built on the insightful hard work of Christ, Hasslacher, and Mueller [16], went beyond\nthe parton model in other, more profound ways. A fast-moving quark is revealed, to probes\nat higher resolution (higher Q2 ), to be composed of slower-moving (smaller x) quarks, antiquarks and gluons, which in turn will resolve into more, softer stuff. This process, seen\nexperimentally as evolution of structure functions, is deeply characteristic of quantum field\ntheory.\nThese evolution effects further enhance the role of glue in the proton. Several of us\nworked out that there should be a dramatic pile-up of soft stuff, particularly soft glue, at\nsmall x [17]. To a hard current (indirectly), or to a hard graviton (theoretically), the proton\nmostly looks like a blob of soft glue. Twenty years later, beautiful work at HERA confirmed\nthese predictions in impressive detail [18].\nVery soft or \"wee\" constituents of protons played a major role in Feynman's ideas\nabout diffractive scattering [19]. His idea was that in diffractive scattering, by exchange of\nwee partons, the relative phases between different multiparton configurations in the proton\nwave function get disrupted, without much transfer of energy-momentum. These ideas are\nintuitively appealing, and have inspired some successful phenomenology, but as far as I\nknow they haven't yet been firmly rooted in QCD.\nMuch better understood \u2013 I hope! \u2013 is the importance of gluonization for some frontier\ntopics in high-energy physics, namely Higgs particle production and WIMP searches. The\nprimary, classical coupling of Higgs particles is to quarks, proportional to their mass. But\nbecause the u and d quarks we mainly find inside nucleons are so light, their direct coupling\nis heavily suppressed. Instead the most important coupling arises indirectly, as a quantum\neffect, through virtual top quark loops connecting to two gluons [20].\nI was originally interested in this Higgs-gluon vertex for its potential to induce Higgs\nparticle decays. Georgi, Glashow, Machacek, and Nanopoulos [21] quickly realized it could\nbe exploited for production of Higgs particles, at hadron colliders, through \"gluon fusion\".\nThis process, which of course relies completely on the glue content of protons, is expected\nto be the main production mechanism for Higgs particles at the LHC. It is important to\ncalculate the production rate accurately, including good estimates of the gluon distribution\nfunctions, so that we will be able to interpret the observed production rate, and check\nwhether the basic vertex is in fact what the standard model, in this intricate way, predicts.\nThe on-shell Higgs particle couples to hard gluons. In its decay we will see jets, and\nwe can estimate the production using gluon structure functions and perturbative QCD.\nWhen considering detection of the sorts of dark-matter candidates provided by models of\nlow-energy supersymmetry we find ourselves involved in quite a different kinematic domain.\nSince these WIMPs will be heavy and slowly moving by particle physics standards, they\n3\n\n\fwill scatter at very small momentum transfer. The coupling of SUSY WIMPs to depends\non poorly constrained details of the models, but in many realizations it is dominated by\nvirtual Higgs exchange. Here the Higgs-gluon vertex comes in at essentially zero energymomentum. Shifman, Vainshtein and Zakharov [22], in beautiful work, related the relevant\ngluon operator to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, whose matrix elements are of\ncourse known. This links back to the old dark momentum problem, bringing us full circle.\nIt is philosophically profound, and quite characteristic of modern physics, that even\nwhen viewing something so basic and tangible as a proton, what you see depends very\nmuch on how you choose to look. Low-energy electrons see point-like particles, the version\ndescribed in old high-school textbooks; hard currents see an evolving pattern of quarks;\ngravitons see these plus lots of gluons as well; wee gluons see some complicated stuff we\ndon't properly understand (we do know its name, Pomeron); real Higgs particles see gluons\nalmost exclusively; and WIMPS, through exchange of virtual Higgs particles, see the Origin\nof Mass. (The trace of the energy momentum tensor, to which they mainly couple, is on\nthe one hand dominated by contributions from massless color gluons and nearly massless\nquarks, and on the other hand equal to the nucleon mass.) Each probe reveals different\naspects of versatile reality.\n\n3\n\nFrom Asymptotic Simplicity to Quark-Gluon Plasma to\nQuark-Hadron Continuity\n\nI mentioned earlier how we've learned to use the concept of asymptotic freedom more boldly\nand confidently over the years. To put it differently, we've learned fruitful ways to lower\nour standards. Instead of trying to prove directly from first principles that weak coupling\napplies , we usually content ourselves with consistency checks. That is, we tentatively\nassume that perturbative calculation of some quantity of interest starting with quark and\ngluon degrees of freedom is adequate, and check whether the calculation contains infrared\ndivergences [23]. This check is by no means trivial, since QCD is full of massless (color)\ncharged particles. So in cases where we find there are no infrared divergences we declare\na well-earned victory, and anticipate that our calculations will approximate reality. This\nstrategic retreat has licensed a host of successful applications to describe jet processes,\ninclusive production, fragmentation, heavy quark physics, and more.\nWe aren't always forced to compromise. In some important applications, including\nlow-energy spectroscopy, direct integration of the equations using the techniques of lattice\ngauge theory is practical. But as physicists hungry for answers, we properly regard strict\nmathematical rigor as a desirable luxury, not an indispensable necessity.\nA particularly interesting and important application of the looser philosophy is to construct self-consistent descriptions of extreme states of matter, starting from quarks and\ngluons [24].\nThe high temperature, low baryon number regime is foundational for very early universe cosmology. It is also the object of an intense, international experimental program\nin relativistic heavy ion physics. The overarching theme is that a perturbative description\nof high-temperature matter, starting with free quarks and gluons, becomes increasingly\naccurate as the temperature increases. This can be seen, for the equation of state, from nu-\n\n4\n\n\fmerical simulation of the full theory [25]. After heroic calculations, which introduce several\ningenious new techniques, controlled perturbative calculations (including terms up to sixth\norder in the coupling, and some infinite resummations) match the numerical work [26]. This\nis a milestone achievement in itself, and also promising for future developments, since the\nperturbative techniques are more flexible. They might be applied, for example, to calculate\nviscosity and energy loss, which can be probed experimentally. In this way, we can hope to\ndo justice to the vision of quark-gluon plasma.\nThe regime of high baryon number density, and low temperature, is intrinsically fascinating, and might be important for describing the inner dynamics of supernovae and the\ndeep interior of neutron stars. The first fundamental result about QCD at high baryon\nnumber density is that many of its key properties, including for example the symmetry\nof the ground state and the energy and charge of the elementary excitations, can not be\ncalculated to a good approximation starting from fermi balls of non-interacting quarks. The\nperturbation theory (for just about anything) contains infrared divergences [24].\nFortunately, the main source of these divergences is well understood. It signals an instability toward the development of a condensate of quark pairs, similar to the Cooper pairs\nthat occur in metallic superconductors. Whereas the phenomenon of superconductivity in\nmetals is very delicate, because one must overcome the dominant Coulomb repulsion of like\ncharges, color superconductivity is very robust, because there is a fundamentally attractive\nforce between quarks (in the color and flavor antitriplet, spin singlet channel). One can\nconstruct an approximate ground state that accommodates the pairs, using the methods\nof BCS theory. Perturbation theory around this new ground state no longer has infrared\ndivergences. Thus we find that strongly interacting matter at asymptotically high density\ncan be studied using weak coupling, but non-perturbative methods.\nColor superconductivity has become an extremely active area of research over the past\nfew years, and many surprises have emerged. Perhaps the most striking and beautiful result\nis the occurrence of color-flavor locking, a new form of symmetry breaking, in real-world\n(3 flavor) QCD at asymptotic densities [27]. The symmetry SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R\nof local color times chiral flavor is broken down to the diagonal subgroup, a residual global\nSU (3).\nColor-flavor locking is a rigorous, calculable consequence of QCD at high density. It\nimplies confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The low-energy excitations are those\ncreated by the quark fields, those created by the gluon fields, and the collective modes\nassociated with chiral symmetry breaking. Because CFL ordering mixes up color and flavor,\nthe quarks form a spin-1/2 octet (plus heavier singlet), the gluons form a vector octet, and\nthe collective modes form a pseudoscalar octet under the residual SU (3). Altogether there\nis an uncanny resemblance between the properties of dense hadronic matter one calculates\nfor the CFL phase, and the properties one might anticipate for \"nuclear matter\" in a world\nwith three massless quarks. A nice perspective on this arises if we consider coupling in\nthe U(1) of electromagnetism. Both the original color gauge symmetry and the original\nelectromagnetic gauge symmetry are broken, but a combination survives. This is similar to\nwhat happens in the standard electroweak model, where both weak isospin and hypercharge\nare broken, but a certain combination survives (to provide electromagnetism). Just as in\nthat case, also in CFL+QED the charge spectrum is modified. One finds that the quarks,\ngluons, and pseudoscalars acquire integral charges (in units of the electron charge); in fact,\n5\n\n\fthe charges precisely match those of the corresponding hadrons.\nIt is difficult to resist the conjecture that these two states are continuously related to one\nanother, with no phase transition, as the density varies [28]. During this variation, degrees\nof freedom that are \"obviously\" three-quark baryons evolve continuously into degrees of\nfreedom that are \"obviously\" single quarks. This nifty trick is possible because diquarks\ncan be exchanged freely with the condensate.\nIf the core of a neutron star is described by the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, which\nseems plausible, it will be a transparent insulator that partially reflects light \u2013 like a diamond! This particular consequence of the CFL phase is unlikely to be observed any time\nsoon, but we are working toward defining indirect signatures in observable neutron star and\nsupernova properties.\nUnfortunately, existing numerical methods for calculating the behavior of QCD converge\nvery slowly at high density and low temperature. They are totally impractical, even for the\nbiggest and best modern computers. Developing usable algorithms for this kind of problem\nis a most important open challenge.\nThere are other stories linking the past with the future through asymptotic freedom and\nQCD, including a particularly interesting and potentially important one involving axions.\nBut I'll stop here.
