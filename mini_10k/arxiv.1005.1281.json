Finally we determine\nthe geometric dimension gd G when G is a soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar group.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a (discrete) group and let F be a family of subgroups of G. That is\nF is non-empty and closed under conjugation and taking subgroups. A classifying\nspace of G for the family F is a G-CW-complex X such that\n(1) the fixed point space X H is contractible if H \u2208 F;\n(2) the fixed point space X H is empty if H is any subgroup of G that does not\nbelong to F.\nWe also say that X is a model for EF G. The quotient space X/G is called a model\nfor BF G.\nClassifying spaces exist for any family F and are unique up to equivariant homotopy [L\u00fcc89]. However in order to do some computation with classifying spaces\nit is important to know nice representatives in the G-homotopy class of models for\nEF G. Generally a model for a classifying space is considered nice if it satisfies some\nfiniteness conditions, for example being finite dimensional or being of finite type\n(only finitely many equivariant cells in each dimension). For more details see for\nexample [L\u00fcc00].\nIn the case that F = {1} is the trivial family of subgroups, the universal cover\nof an Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane space K(G, 1) is a model for EG := EF G. A classifying\nspace for the family F = Ffin (G) of finite subgroups of G is also known as the\nuniversal G-space for proper actions and denoted by EG. For these families many\nnice models are known. For more details we refer to the comprehensive survey\narticle on classifying spaces by L\u00fcck [L\u00fcc05].\nDate: July 6, 2010.\n\n\f2\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nThe object of study in our text is the classifying space for the family F = Fvc (G)\nof virtually cyclic subgroups which is denoted by EG. Recently classifying spaces\nfor this family of subgroups caught the interest of the mathematical community\ndue to its appearance as the geometric object in the Farrell\u2013Jones conjecture in\nalgebraic K- and L-theory (this conjecture is originally stated in [FJ93]). In contrast to models for EG and EG, the classifying spaces for virtually cyclic subgroups are not well understood. Classes of groups that are understood are word\nhyperbolic groups [JPL06], virtually polycyclic groups [LW07], relative hyperbolic\ngroups [LO07] and CAT(0)-groups [L\u00fcc09, Far09]. Furthermore, there exist general\nconstructions for finite index extensions [L\u00fcc00] and direct limits of groups [LW07].\nSome more specific constructions can also be found in [CFH06] and [MPP08].\nAmong the classes of groups for which there are no known nice models for EG\nare soluble groups or, more broadly, elementary amenable groups. Even in the case\nthat G is metabelian there is no known general constructions for a nice model for\nEG. In a recent paper [KMPN10] it has been shown that one cannot expect any\nfinite type model for EG when G is an elementary amenable group. In general it\nis conjectured that the there exists no finite model for EG when G is not virtually\ncyclic [JPL06].\nIt turns out that virtually cyclic extensions are the major source of obstruction\nto a general construction of nice models for EG, see for example Theorem 5.1\nin [MP02]. As mentioned above, there exists a general construction for finite index\nextensions. However there is no known general construction for an infinite cyclic\nextension, not to mention the case of a virtually cyclic extension.\nIn this article we will consider infinite cyclic extensions of an arbitrary group B.\nThese are precisely the semidirect products G = B \u22ca Z. We will show how to\nconstruct a model for EG when a model for EB is given, provided that the following\ncondition on the extension is satisfied: Z acts freely by conjugation on the set of\nconjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B. This construction will be such that\na finite dimensional model for EB will give a finite dimensional model for EG. The\nresulting models will be far away from being of finite type. One major ingredient in\nour paper is an adaptation of a construction of Juan-Pineda and Leary in [JPL06].\nThe main result of this paper is Theorem 15, where we give bounds on the\nminimal dimension a model for EG can have. The class of groups to which this\ntheorem can be applied to includes certain strictly descending HNN-extensions with\nabelian or free base groups, certain wreath products by Z and the soluble Baumslag\u2013\nSolitar groups BS(1, m) with |m| \u2265 2. Furthermore, in the latter case we will give\nan explicite construction of a model for EG of minimal dimension. This brings us\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n3\n\nto our second main result, Theorem 20, which gives a precise answer for the possible\nminimal dimensions of a model for EG when G is a soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar group.\nThis article is part of the author's Ph.D. thesis, supervised by Brita Nucinkis at\nthe University of Southampton. The author wishes to express his gratitude to Brita\nNucinkis, Ashot Minasyan, Armando Martino and Holger Reich for their inspiring\nconversation and very valuable comment which helped the author a lot in the work\non this article. Thanks are also due to Andrew Warshall who kindly made the\nauthor aware of a missing assumption in Lemma 1.\n2. Technical Preparations\nLet B be a group and let \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(B). Recall that a model for the semidirect\nproduct\nG := B \u22ca Z\nwhere Z acts on B via the automorphism \u03c6 is the set B \u00d7 Z with the multiplication\ngiven by\n(x, r) * (y, s) := (x\u03c6r (y), r + s).\nThe identity is (1, 0) and the inverse of any element (x, r) is given by (x, r)\u22121 =\n(\u03c6\u2212r (x\u22121 ), \u2212r). The group B is embedded via x 7\u2192 (x, 0) as a normal subgroup\nof G and we consider Z embedded as a subgroup of G via r 7\u2192 (1, r).\nLemma 1. Assume that B is torsion free and does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z2 . Then Z acts freely by conjugation on the set of conjugacy classes of the\nnon-trivial elements of B if and only if G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic\nto Z2 .\nProof. \"\u21d0\": Suppose that H is a subgroup of G which is isomorphic to Z2 . Since\nH cannot be contained in B it follows that there exists (x, r) \u2208 H \\ B. On the\nother hand H cannot have a non-trivial intersection with B and thus there exist a\nnon-trivial (y, 0) \u2208 B \u2229 H. Then the commutator\n[(x, r), (y, 0)] = (x\u03c6r (y)x\u22121 y \u22121 , 0)\nmust be trivial which is the case if and only if x\u03c6r (y)x\u22121 y \u22121 = 1. This implies\nthat \u03c6r (y) and y belong to the same conjugacy class in B. Since r 6= 0 and y 6= 1\nthis implies that Z does not act freely on the set of conjugacy classes of non-trivial\nelements of B.\n\"\u21d2\": Suppose that Z does not act freely on the set of conjugacy classes of nontrivial elements of B. Then there exists 1 6= y \u2208 B and 0 6= r \u2208 Z such that\n\u03c6r (y) = x\u22121 yx for some x \u2208 B. This implies that the non-trivial elements (x, r)\nand (y, 0) commute. In general (x, r) has infinite order and since B is assumed to\n\n\f4\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nbe torsion free it follows that the order of (y, 0) is also infinite. Therefore (x, r) and\n(y, 0) generate a subgroup of G which is isomorphic to Z2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe statement in the next lemma is only non-trivial if B has torsion.\nLemma 2. Assume that Z acts freely via conjugation on the set of conjugacy classes\nof non-trivial elements of B. If H be a virtually cyclic subgroup of G which is not\na subgroup of B then H is infinite cyclic.\nProof. First we note that all x \u2208 G \\ B have infinite order. Hence the subgroup\n\u03c4 (H) of H which is generated by all the elements of H which have finite order is a\nsubgroup of B.\nBy assumption there exists (x, r) \u2208 H with r 6= 0. Then the infinite cyclic subgroup of H generated by this element has trivial intersection with B and therefore\nalso has trivial intersection with \u03c4 (H). Since H is virtually cyclic this can happen\nonly if \u03c4 (H) is finite.\nAssume towards a contradiction that there exists a non-trivial (y, 0) \u2208 \u03c4 (H).\nk\n\nThen (zk , 0) := (y, 0)(x,r) , k \u2208 N, is a sequence of elements in \u03c4 (H) such that for\neach k \u2208 N the element zk is conjugate in B to \u03c6\u2212rk (y). This claim is verified by\ninduction. The case k = 0 is trivial. Thus assume that (zk , 0) \u2208 \u03c4 (H) and that there\nexists u \u2208 B such that zk = u\u22121 \u03c6\u2212rk (y)u. Since \u03c4 (H) is a characteristic subgroup\nof H and (x, r) \u2208 H it follows that (zk+1 , 0) = (zk , 0)(x,r) \u2208 \u03c4 (H). Furthermore we\nhave that\n(zk+1 , 0) = (zk , 0)(x,r) = (\u03c6\u2212r (x\u22121 zk x), 0)\nand hence zk+1 = \u03c6\u2212r (x\u22121 u\u22121 \u03c6\u2212rk (y)ux) = v \u22121 \u03c6\u2212r(k+1) (y)v with v := \u03c6\u2212r (gx).\nThat is that zk+1 is conjugate in B to \u03c6\u2212r(k+1) (y). By assumption Z acts freely via\nconjugation on the conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B and hence all zk\nbelong to different conjugacy classes. In particular they are all pairwise different.\nThus {(zk , 0) : k \u2208 N} forms an infinite subset of \u03c4 (H). But this is a contradiction\nas we have shown above that \u03c4 (H) is finite! Therefore \u03c4 (H) must be trivial. It\nfollows that the virtually cyclic group H does not have any torsion and thus it must\nbe infinite cyclic.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3. Assume that Z acts freely via conjugation on the set of conjugacy classes\nof non-trivial elements of B. Then for any (x, r) \u2208 G \\ B and y \u2208 B we have\n(x, r)y = (x, r) \u21d0\u21d2 y = 1.\nProof. (x, r)y = (x, r) is equivalent to \u03c6(y) = xyx\u22121 , which is by assumption on\nthe action of Z on B equivalent to y = 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n5\n\nLemma 4. Under the assumptions of the previous lemma, if H is an infinite cyclic\nsubgroup of G that is not a subgroup of B, and y \u2208 B, then |H \u2229 H y | = \u221e if and\nonly if y = 1.\nProof. The \"if\" statement is trivial. Therefore assume that y 6= 1 and let (x, r) be\na generator of H. Then r 6= 0 and\n(z, r) := (x, r)y 6= (x, r)\nis a generator of H y where the inequality is due to Lemma 3. Suppose, for a\ncontradiction, that |H \u2229 H y | = \u221e. Then there must exist k, l \u2208 Z \\ {0} such that\n(x, r)k = (z, r)l . In particular this implies that k = l. But then we get\n\u0001y\n\u0001k\n(z, r)l = (z, r)k = (x, r)y = (x, r)k 6= (x, r)k ,\n\nwhere the last inequality is again due to Lemma 3, and so we achieve our desired\ncontradiction. Hence we must have |H \u2229 H y | 6= \u221e.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs in [LW07, p. 5] we define an equivalence relation \"\u223c\" on the set Fvc (G)\\Ffin (G)\nby\nH \u223c K :\u21d0\u21d2 |H \u2229 K| = \u221e.\nWe denote by [H] the equivalence class of the group H. If K is not finite then K \u2264 H\nimplies that K \u223c H. Furthermore the equivalence relation satisfies H \u223c K if and\nonly H g \u223c K g . Therefore the action of G by conjugation on the set Fvc (G)\\ Ffin (G)\ngives an action of G on the set of equivalence classes. If [H] is an equivalence class,\nthen we denote by G[H] the stabiliser of [H].\nGiven subgroup H of G, the commensurator CommG (H) of H in G is defined\nas the subgroup\nCommG (H) := {g \u2208 G : |H : H \u2229 H g | and |H g : H \u2229 H g | are finite}.\nThis subgroup is also known as the virtual normaliser V NG (H) of the subgroup H\nin G. In general it contains the normaliser NG (H) of H in G as its subgroup. In\nthe case that H is a virtually cyclic subgroup of G which is not finite we have\nCommG (H) = {g \u2208 G : |H \u2229 H g | = \u221e}.\nIn particular we have that CommG (H) = G[H] in this case.\nLemma 5. Assume that Z acts freely by conjugation on the set of non-trivial\nconjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B. Then CommG (H) is infinite cyclic\nfor any virtually cyclic subgroup H of G that is not a subgroup of B.\nProof. Any such virtually cyclic subgroup H of G is infinite cyclic by Lemma 2.\nTherefore G[H] = CommG (H). Suppose that G[H] is not infinite cyclic. Then the\ncanonical projection \u03c0: B \u22ca Z \u2192 Z cannot map G[H] isomorphically onto its image.\n\n\f6\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nHence there exists a non-trivial y \u2208 G[H] \u2229 ker(\u03c0) = G[H] \u2229 B. Since H is infinite\ncyclic we get |H \u2229H y | 6= \u221e by Lemma 4 which is equivalent to [H] 6= [H y ], and this\nis a contradiction to the assumption that y \u2208 G[H] . Therefore G[H] = CommG (H)\nmust be infinite cyclic.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 6. Let G be an arbitrary group and let F and G be families of subgroups of G such that\nFfin (G) \u2282 F \u2282 G \u2282 Fvc (G).\nAssume that the commensurator CommG (H) \u2208 G for any H \u2208 G \\ F, then every\nH \u2208 G \\ F is contained in a unique maximal element Hmax \u2208 G and NG (Hmax ) =\nHmax .\nProof. Since H is an infinite virtually cyclic subgroup of G it follows that G[H] =\nCommG (H) and thus G[H] \u2208 G by assumption.\nTrivially we have that H \u2264 G[H] . If K \u2208 G with H \u2264 K, then H \u223c K since H\nis not finite, and for any k \u2208 K we get [H k ] = [K k ] = [K] = [H]. Therefore any\nk \u2208 K stabilises [H]. This implies K \u2264 G[H] and thus G[H] is maximal and unique\nin G \\ F, that is Hmax = G[H] .\nFinally, Hmax \u2264 NG (Hmax ) \u2264 CommG (Hmax ) = G[Hmax ] = Hmax and hence\nHmax = NG (Hmax ).\n\n\u0003\n\nTogether with Lemma 2, we get then the following result:\nCorollary 7. Let G = B\u22caZ and assume that Z acts freely by conjugation on the set\nof conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B. Then every H \u2208 Fvc (G) \\ Fvc (B)\nis contained in a unique maximal element Hmax \u2208 Fvc (G)\\Fvc (B) and NG (Hmax ) =\nHmax . Moreover Fvc (B) \u2229 H = {1} for any H \u2208 Fvc (G) \\ Fvc (B).\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Juan-Pineda and Leary's Construction\nLet G be an arbitrary group and assume that F and G are two families of\nsubgroups of G which satisfy the conditions of Proposition 6.\nLet H be a virtually cyclic group. Then by [JPL06, p. 137], there exists a unique\nmaximal normal finite subgroup N of H and precisely one of the cases occurs: H\nis finite, H/N is infinite cyclic (we say H is orientable) or H/N is infinite dihedral\n(we say H is non-orientable).\nThe following result is a natural generalisation of Proposition 9 and Corollary 10\nin [JPL06, pp. 140f.]. Juan-Pineda and Leary's proof can be used unchanged to\nverify these statements.\nProposition 8 (Juan-Pineda and Leary). Assume that every H \u2208 G\\F is contained\nin a unique maximal element Hmax \u2208 G and NG (Hmax ) = Hmax . Moreover, assume\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n7\n\nthat F\u2229H \u2282 Ffin (H) for every H \u2208 G\\ F. Let C be a complete set of representatives\nof conjugacy classes of the maximal elements of G \\ F. Denote by Co and the set of\norientable elements of C and denote by Cn the set of non-orientable elements of C.\nThen a model for EG G can be obtained from model for EF G by attaching\n(1) orbits of 0-cells indexed by C;\n(2) orbits of 1-cells indexed by Co \u222a {1, 2} \u00d7 Cn ;\n(3) orbits of 2-cells indexed by C.\nFurthermore, a model for BG G can be obtained from a model for BF G by attaching\n2-cells indexed by Co .\n\n\u0003\n\nJuan-Pineda and Leary's construction is essentially the following. For each maximal H \u2208 G \\ F there exists a 1-dimensional model EH for EH which is homeomorphic to the real line. The model EH has one orbit of 1-cells and either one or\ntwo orbits of 0-cells depending on if H is orientable or non-orientable. Let X be a\nmodel for EF G. Then a model for EG G is obtained from X by attaching pieces of\nthe form\n\u000e\nXH := EH \u00d7 [0, 1] \u223c\n\nto X for each maximal element H \u2208 G \\ F using suitable equivariant maps \u03b7: EH \u00d7\n{0} \u2192 X and where the equivalence relation \"\u223c\" identifies all elements (x, 1) \u2208 XH .\nJuan-Pineda and Leary have shown how to implement this construction such that\nwe get a G-CW-complex with the desired properties.\nNote that in the case G = Fvc (G) and F = Ffin (G), we recover the original\nstatements in [JPL06]. However, we apply it to the case that G = B\u22caZ, F = Fvc (B)\nand G = Fvc (G). If Z acts freely by conjugation on the set of conjugacy classes of\nnon-trivial elements of B, then Corollary 7 tells us that we can use Proposition 8 in\norder to construct a model for EG from a model for EFvc (B) G. However, in order\nto obtain this way a nice model for EG we need to have a nice model for EFvc (B) G\nto start with. In the next section we will give a general construction for such a\nmodel if a nice model for EB is given.\n4. Constructing a Model for EF G from a Model for EF B\nWe carry out the construction in a setting that is more general than in Section 3.\nLet G = B \u22ca Z be an arbitrary infinite cyclic extension, where Z acts on B via an\nautomorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(B). Let F be a family of subgroups of B. We assume that\nF is invariant under the automorphism \u03c6, that is, \u03c6k (H) \u2208 F for every H \u2208 F and\nk \u2208 Z. This implies that H \u2208 F if and only if \u03c6(H) \u2208 F for any subgroup H of B.\nFurthermore this implies that F is not just a family of subgroups of B but also a\nfamily of subgroups of G.\n\n\f8\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nXk\u22121\n\nXk\n\nXk+1\n\nXk+2\n\nFigure 1. A schematic picture of the B-CW-complex Y .\nWe begin our construction with the assumption that we are given a model X for\nEF B. For each k \u2208 Z let Xk be a copy of X seen as a set. We define a B-action\n\u03a6k : B \u00d7 X k \u2192 X k\non Xk by \u03a6k (g, x) := \u03c6\u2212k (g)x.\nSince X0 and X1 are models for EB there exists a B-map f : X0 \u2192 X1 . In other\nwords f is a continuous map f : X \u2192 X which satisfies f (gx) = \u03c6\u22121 (g)f (x) for every\nx \u2208 X and g \u2208 B. By the equivariant Cellular Approximation Theorem [L\u00fcc89,\np. 32] we may assume without loss of generality that f is cellular. Denote by X\u221e\nthe disjoint union of B-spaces\nX\u221e :=\n\na\n\n(Xk \u00d7 [0, 1])\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nand let Y be the quotient space\n\nY := X\u221e / \u223c\nunder the equivalence relation generated by (x, 1) \u223c (f (x), 0) whenever x \u2208 Xk and\nf (x) \u2208 Xk+1 for some k \u2208 Z. Since f is a cellular B-map it follows that Y is a\nB-CW-complex. Essentially, it is a mapping telescope which extends to infinity in\nboth directions, see Figure 1. Note that if X is an n-dimensional B-CW-complex,\nthen Y is (n + 1) dimensional B-CW-complex.\nLemma 9. The B-CW-complex Y is a model for EF B.\nProof. Let H be a subgroup of B such that H \u2208\n/ F and let x \u2208 Xk for some k \u2208 Z.\nSince F is assumed to be invariant under the automorphism \u03c6 we have \u03c6\u2212k (H) \u2208\n/ F.\nTherefore there exists a h \u2208 H such that \u03c6\u2212k (h)x 6= x. But then\n\u03a6k (h, x) = \u03c6\u2212k (h)x 6= x,\nwhich implies that x \u2208\n/ XkH . It follows that XkH = \u2205 and therefore also YkH = \u2205 for\nall k \u2208 Z. Hence Y H = \u2205.\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n9\n\nOn the other hand, consider the case that H \u2208 F. Since the family F is assumed\nto be invariant under the automorphism \u03c6 it follows that \u03c6k (H) \u2208 F for every\nk \u2208 Z. Then XkH = X \u03c6\n\nk\n\n(H)\n\nis contractible for every k \u2208 Z. Choose for every\n\nk \u2208 Z an element xk \u2208 XkH and a contracting homotopy hk : XkH \u2243 {xk }. This\ninduces a contracting homotopy h: Y H \u2243 L where L is a subspace of Y H which\nis homeomorphic to the real line R. Since L is contractible it follows that Y H is\ncontractible.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor every (x, t) \u2208 Xk \u00d7 [0, 1] and (g, r) \u2208 G set\n\u03a8(g, r) := (\u03a6k+r (g, x), t) \u2208 Xk+r \u00d7 [0, 1].\nStraight forward calculation shows that this induces a well defined action\n\u03a8: G \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y\nof G on Y , which extends the already existing B-action on Y . If (g, r) \u2208 G \\ B,\nthen r 6= 0 and therefore clearly \u03a8((g, r), x) 6= x for any x \u2208 Y . Then together with\nLemma 9 this implies that Y is an (n + 1)-dimensional model for EF G. Altogether\nwe have then shown the following result.\nProposition 10. Let G = B \u22ca Z be an arbitrary infinite cyclic extension where\nZ acts on B via an automorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(B). Let F be a family of subgroups of\nB which is invariant under the automorphism \u03c6. If there exists an n-dimensional\nmodel for EF B then there exists an (n + 1)-dimensional model for EF G.\n\n\u0003\n\n5. Examples\nStrictly descending HNN-extensions are a natural source for candidates for infinite cyclic extensions G = B \u22ca Z where Z acts freely by conjugation on the set of\nconjugacy classes of the non-trivial elements of B.\nThe general setup is the following. Let B0 be a group and \u03c6: B0 \u2192 B0 a\nmonomorphism which. Recall that the descending HNN-extension determined by\nthis data is the group G given by the presentation\nG := hB0 , t | t\u22121 xt = \u03c6(x) for all x \u2208 B0 i\nand this group is usually denoted by B0 \u2217\u03c6 in the literature. The group B0 is\ncalled the base group of the HNN-extension. The HNN-extension is called strictly\ndescending if the monomorphism \u03c6 is not an isomorphism. We consider B0 in the\nobvious way as a subgroup of G.\nConjugation by t \u2208 G defines an automorphism of G which agrees on B0 with \u03c6\nwhich we will therefore denote by the same symbol. In other words, the monomorphism \u03c6: B0 \u2192 B0 extends to the whole group G if we set\n\u03c6: G \u2192 G, x 7\u2192 \u03c6(x) := t\u22121 xt.\n\n\f10\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nFor each k \u2208 Z we set Bk := \u03c6k (B0 ). We obtain this way a descending sequence\n. . . \u2283 B\u22122 \u2283 B\u22121 \u2283 B0 \u2283 B1 \u2283 B2 \u2283 . . .\nof subgroups of G. This sequence of subgroups is strictly descending if and only\nif the HNN-extension is strictly descending. We denote the directed union of all\nthese Bk by B. The automorphism \u03c6 restricts to an automorphism of B which\nis therefore a normal subgroup of G. It is standard fact that we can write G as\nthe semidirect product G = B \u22ca Z where Z acts on B via the automorphism \u03c6\nrestricted to B.\nLemma 11. Assume that for every non-trivial x \u2208 B0 there exists a k \u2208 N such\nthat x \u2208\n/ \u03c6k (B0 ). Given x \u2208 B0 denote by [x] the set of all elements in B0 which\nare conjugate in B0 to x. Assume that for each x \u2208 B we are given a finite subset\n[x]\u2032 \u2282 [x] such that \u03c6([x]\u2032 ) \u2282 [\u03c6(x)]\u2032 for every x \u2208 B0 . Then Z acts freely on the\nset of conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B.\nProof. We suppose that Z does not act freely on the set of conjugacy classes of\nnon-trivial elements of B. Then there exists x \u2208 B and n \u2265 1 such that \u03c6n (x) is\nconjugate in B to x. Without any loss of generality we may assume that x \u2208 B0\n(otherwise replace x by \u03c6k (x) for a suitable k \u2208 N). Furthermore, without any loss\nof generality we may assume that x \u2208 [x]\u2032 . Finally we may assume without any loss\nof generality that \u03c6n (x) is actually conjugate in B0 to x (otherwise, again, replace\nx by \u03c6k (x) for a suitable k \u2208 N).\nNow \u03c6rn (x) \u2208 [x]\u2032 for any r \u2265 1. Since [x]\u2032 is finite this implies that \u03c6rn (x) =\n\u03c6sn (x) for some s > r. Therefore \u03c6(s\u2212r)n (x) = x and since (s \u2212 r)n > 0 it follows\nthat x \u2208 \u03c6k (B0 ) for any k \u2208 N. However, this is a contradiction on the hypothesis\nthat Z does not act freely on the set of conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements\nof B. Therefore the opposite must be true.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that the requirement that for every non-trivial element x \u2208 B0 there exists a\nk \u2208 N such that x \u2208\n/ \u03c6k (B0 ) implies that the descending HNN-extension G = B0 \u2217\u03c6\nis actually strictly descending. Furthermore, we can conclude from it that the\nintersection of the groups Bk , k \u2208 Z, is trivial.\nExample 12. Let B0 be an abelian group and \u03c6: B0 \u2192 B0 a monomorphism\nsuch that for every non-trivial x \u2208 B0 there exists a k \u2208 N such that x \u2208\n/ \u03c6k (B0 ).\nSince B0 is abelian, each conjugacy class [x] of elements in B0 contains precisely\none element. Therefore Lemma 11 states that Z acts freely by conjugation on the\nset of non-trivial elements of B. In particular we can use Proposition 8 to obtain a\nmodel for EG from a model for EFvc (B) G.\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n11\n\nLet B0 be a free group. An element x \u2208 B0 is called cyclically reduced if it cannot\nbe written as x = u\u22121 yu for some non-trivial u, y \u2208 B0 . It follows from [MKS76,\npp. 33ff.] that every element x \u2208 B0 is conjugate to a cyclically reduced element x\u2032\nand that there are only finitely many cyclically reduced elements in B0 which are\nconjugate to x. Therefore\n[x]\u2032 := {x\u2032 \u2208 [x] : x\u2032 is cyclically reduced}\nis a finite subset of [x] for every x \u2208 B0 . Then the following two assumptions on\nthe monomorphism \u03c6: B0 \u2192 B0 are necessary in order to apply Lemma 11:\n(1) For every non-trivial x \u2208 B0 there exists a k \u2208 N such that x \u2208\n/ \u03c6k (B0 );\n(2) If x is a cyclically reduced element in B0 , then so \u03c6(x).\nExample 13. Let X be an arbitrary non-empty set and let B0 := F (X) be the free\ngroup on the basis X. Let {\u03b1x }x\u2208X be a collection of integers such that |\u03b1x | \u2265 2\nfor every x \u2208 X. Consider the endomorphism \u03c6: B0 \u2192 B0 that maps any basis\nelement x to x\u03b1x . Then \u03c6 is a monomorphism which satisfies the assumptions (1)\nand (2) above. Lemma 11 tells us then that we can use Proposition 8 to construct\na model for EG from a model for EFvc (B) G.\nExample 14. Another example of a strictly descending HNN-extension (in disguise) is the standard wreath product A \u2240 Z of an arbitrary group A by Z which is\ndefined as follows. Let Ak be a copy of A for each k \u2208 Z. Let B be the coproduct\nof all these Ak and let Z act on B via \u03c6 which maps Ak identically onto Ak+1 for\nall k \u2208 Z. Then\nA \u2240 Z := B \u22ca Z.\nSince each Ak is normal in B the above definition of \u03c6 forces the action of Z on the\nset of conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B to be free. Therefore we can\napply Proposition 8 in this case, too.\n6. Dimensions\nGiven a family F of subgroups of G, a model for EF G is only defined uniquely up\nto G-homotopy. Consider a model for EF G. One particular invariant of the group\nG is called the geometric dimension of G with respect to the family F, and this\nis defined as being the least possible dimension of a model for EF G. It is denoted\nby gdF G and may be infinite. In the case that F = {1} we recover the classical\ngeometric dimension of the group G. In the case that F = Fvc (G) we denote the\ngeometric dimension by gd G.\n\n\f12\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nTheorem 15. Let G = B \u22ca Z and assume that Z acts freely via conjugation on the\nconjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of B. Then B is not virtually cyclic and\ngd B \u2264 gd G \u2264 gd B + 1.\nProof. Since (in general) a model for EG is always a model for EB via restriction, we have that the second inequality is the only non-trivial one. If X is an\nn-dimensional model for EB, then the joint construction in Section 4 gives an\n(n + 1)-dimensional model for EFvc (B) G.\nSince B cannot be virtually cyclic we have n + 1 \u2265 2 and attaching cells of\ndimension at most 2 does not increase the dimension of the resulting space. Hence\nProposition 8 yields an (n + 1)-dimensional model for EG and this concludes the\nproof.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 16. Let G = B0 \u2217\u03c6 is a descending HNN-extension as in Section 5. If\nG = B \u22ca Z satisfies the conditions of the previous proposition then\ngd B0 \u2264 gd G \u2264 gd B0 + 2.\nProof. As exploited previously, since B0 is a subgroup of G, the second inequality\nis the only non-trivial part of the statement. The group B is the countable direct\nunion of the conjugates of B0 in G. Therefore an n-dimensional model for EB0\ngives rise to an (n + 1)-dimensional model for EB by a construction of L\u00fcck and\nWeiermann [LW07, pp. 11ff.]. Now the claim follows from the previous proposition.\n\u0003\nExample 17. Let G = B0 \u2217\u03c6 be a descending HNN-extension with B0 a free group.\nIf B0 has rank 1, then G is a soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar group and this case is treated\nbelow in Theorem 20. Thus we may assume that B0 has rank at least 2. Free groups\nare torsion free and act freely on a tree which is therefore a 1-dimensional model for\nEB0 . Free groups are word hyperbolic and therefore Proposition 9 in [JPL06] states\nthe existence of a 2-dimensional model for EB0 . On the other hand by Remark 16\nin [JPL06] there cannot exist a model for EB0 less than 2. Therefore gd B0 = 2.\nNow the direct union B of all conjugates of B0 in G is locally free and therefore\ndoes not contain a subgroup of isomorphic to Z2 . Then Lemma 1 states that we\ncan apply Corollary 16 if and only if G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic\nto Z2 . Therefore we get in this case the estimation 2 \u2264 gd G \u2264 4.\nExample 18. Consider the wreath product G = A \u2240 Z where A is a countable\nlocally finite group. Then\nB :=\n\na\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nA\n\n\fCLASSIFYING SPACES WITH VIRTUALLY CYCLIC STABILISERS\n\n13\n\nis a also a countable locally finite group. Then B is a countable colimit of its finite\nsubgroups B\u03bb and Theorem 4.3 in [LW07] gives the estimate gd B \u2264 sup{gd B\u03bb }+1.\nSince gd B\u03bb = 0 for every \u03bb and we get gd B \u2264 1. On the other hand B is not\nvirtually cyclic and therefore gd B 6= 0, that is gd B = 1. We have seen that\nG does satisfy the requirements of Theorem 15. Therefore we get the estimate\n1 \u2264 gd(A \u2240 Z) \u2264 2. Note that A \u2240 Z is not locally virtually cyclic. Therefore we can\nfurthermore exclude the possibility gd(A \u2240 Z) = 1 using the next proposition. Thus\nwe have altogether\ngd(A \u2240 Z) = 2.\nNote that the smallest concrete example of a group of this type is the lamplighter\ngroup L = Z2 \u2240 Z where Z2 is the cyclic group of the integers modulo 2.\nProposition 19. Let G be a group with gd G = 1. Then G is a locally virtually\ncyclic and not finitely generated.\nProof. The assumption gd G = 1 implies that G has a tree T as a model for EG. If\nG is finitely generated then Corollary 3 to Proposition 25 in [Ser03, pp. 64] states\nthat T G 6= \u2205 which implies that G is virtually cyclic. But this means gd G = 0 which\ncontradicts the assumption that gd G = 1. Therefore G is not finitely generated.\nLet H be a finitely generated subgroup of G. Since H is a subgroup of G we\nhave gd H \u2264 gd G. However, since H is finitely generated the the case gd H 6= 1\ncannot occur. Therefore gd H = 0 which implies that H is virtually cyclic. Hence\nG is locally virtually cyclic.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe conclude this article with a complete answer to the geometric dimension of\nthe soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar groups with respect to the family of virtually cyclic\nsubgroups. These groups belong to a class of two-generator and one-relator groups\nintroduced by Baumslag and Solitar in [BS62]. Their class consists of the groups\nBS(p, q) = hx, t | t\u22121 xp t = xq i.\nwhere p and q are non-zero integers. The soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar groups are\nprecisely those groups which are isomorphic to BS(1, m) for some m 6= 0. These\ngroups can also be written as\nBS(1, m) = Z[1/m] \u22ca Z,\nwhere Z[1/m] is the subgroup of the rational numbers Q generated by all powers\nof 1/m and where Z acts on Z[1/m] by multiplication by m. The group BS(1, 1)\nis Z2 and BS(1, \u22121) is the Klein bottle group Z \u22ca Z. If |m| \u2265 2, then BS(1, m)\nbelongs to the case described in Example 12, as well as to the case described in\nExample 13.\n\n\f14\n\nMARTIN FLUCH\n\nTheorem 20. Let G = BS(1, m) be a soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar group. Then\n(\n3 if |m| = 1,\ngd G =\n2 otherwise.\nProof. The case |m| = 1 has been answered in Example 3 and Remark 15 in [JPL06].\nThus we assume that |m| \u2265 2. The group Z[1/m] is countable and locally\nvirtually cyclic. Therefore gd Z[1/m] \u2264 1 by [LW07, pp. 11ff.]. The action of Z\non the conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of Z[1/m] is free and thus we can\napply Theorem 15 to obtain the estimate gd G \u2264 2. However, gd G cannot be zero\nas G is not virtually cyclic. Moreover G is finitely generated and therefore gd G 6= 1\nby Proposition 19. Thus gd G = 2 is the only remaining possibility.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe conclude this article with a model for EG for the soluble Baumslag\u2013Solitar\ngroups G = BS(1, m), |m| 6= 1, which is nicer than the one obtained from the\ngeneral construction in Section 4 together with Proposition 8. The group G can\nbe realised as the fundamental group of a graph (G, Y ) of groups in the sense\nof [Ser03] where Y is a loop and where the vertex and edge groups are all infinite\ncyclic. Let T be the Bass\u2013Serre tree associated with this graph of groups. It follows\nthat T is not only a model for EZ[1/m], but also a model for EFvc (Z[1/m]) G. We\ncan apply Proposition 8 and obtain a model X for EG by attaching orbits of 0-,\n1- and 2-cells to T indexed by the infinitely many conjugacy classes of maximal\ninfinite cyclic subgroups of G which are not contained in the subgroup Z[1/m].\nFurthermore, since Y = T /G, we obtain a model for BG by attaching infinitely\nmany 2-cells along the loop Y . That is, a model for BG is given by the quotient\nspace (D2 \u00d7 Z)/ \u223c where the equivalence relation is given by (x, k) \u223c (x, l) for all\nx \u2208 \u2202D2 = S 1 and all k, l \u2208 Z.\nReferences\n[BS62]\n\nGilbert Baumslag and Donald Solitar.
