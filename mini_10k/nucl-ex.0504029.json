If hydrogen targets\nare used, small\u2013angle electron scattering from protons must be distinguished\nfrom the signal of interest which is the electron\u2013electron scattering. This report describes detectors built to measure the spatial distribution and relative\nintegral flux of scattered electrons from intense incident beams of 48.3 and 45.0\nGeV electrons incident upon a liquid hydrogen target in the E158 experiment\nat the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center [1].\nThe detector design confronted two main challenges. First, the intensity of\nthe scattered electron flux of interest (\u223c 1011 electrons/s/cm2 at a duty cycle of 2.4 \u2217 10\u22125 ) created a very harsh radiation environment. This precluded\nthe use of components that would be exposed for significant periods to the\nscattered beam, including photomultiplier tubes. Second, within the scattered\nbeam the particle flux varied by more than an order\u2013of\u2013magnitude. The detector therefore needed to have fine granularity without being influenced by\nthe magnitude of the flux nearby.\nThe active detector element was fused silica that produced Cherenkov light\nand was preceded by a tungsten pre\u2013radiator. Such detectors are not only\nradiation\u2013hard, but they also have a directional response that can be exploited to suppress background. Cherenkov light from the fused silica was directed by means of a reflective air\u2013core light\u2013guide to a photomultiplier tube\n(PMT) safely located outside the scattered beam, 50 cm from the radiator.\nConventional solid light\u2013guide materials were unacceptable. Such light guides\nwould produce abundant Cherenkov light on their own and could scintillate.\nFurthermore, they would degrade or discolor because of the intense radiation\nbackground. The light produced inside such light guides could exceed the small\nsignal produced when the detector's active element \u2212 but not the light guide\n\u2212 is located in a region of relatively low scattered beam intensity. The air\u2013core\nlight guides we developed consisted of hollow\u2013tubes lined with reflective Alzak\nsheet [2]. Alzak has an optical finish produced by electrochemically brightening and anodizing a high purity aluminum alloy. It also has high permanent\nreflectivity and good resistance to corrosion and abrasion.\nThese detectors were mounted on electromechanical movers that allowed the\ndetector element to be moved remotely through the scattered beam. In one\napplication this enabled us to determine the full spatial profile of the scattered\nbeam intensity. Of course, the same result could also have been achieved by\nusing an array of detectors and light\u2013guides. However, this would have required\nperiodic cross\u2013calibrations of the responses of the various detectors. The use\nof a single, or, at most, a small number of scanning detectors not only avoided\n2\n\n\fthis chore, but also facilitated the removal of the detectors from the scattered\nbeam profile during data acquisition with other detectors.\nThese detectors were developed for SLAC experiment E158 [1] whose objective was to determine the weak mixing angle by the measurement of parity\u2013\nviolation in the M\u00f8ller scattering of polarized electrons from electrons in a liquid hydrogen target. This experiment employed a forward spectrometer, and\nthe polarization asymmetry of the M\u00f8ller cross section was determined by flux\u2013\nintegration of the forward\u2013scattered electron beams of different helicities. Due\nto the design of the E158 spectrometer, scattered electrons were constrained\nto two forward\u2013directed circular bands between 4.4 and 7.5 mr surrounding an\nintense background of forward photons generated by bremsstrahlung within\nthe target. Near the main E158 calorimeter detector, the radial distribution of\nthe scattered electron ranged from 18\u201335 cm, with M\u00f8ller electrons confined to\nan inner band of radius 18\u201324 cm containing about 2 \u2217 107 electrons per beam\npulse. Outside the M\u00f8ller band was a concentric band of electrons produced by\nthe scattering of the incident electrons off the protons in the hydrogen target.\n\n2\n\nSmall\u2013probe Cherenkov detectors\n\n2.1 General Discussion\n\nThe primary function of these detectors was to carefully map the relative\nspatial distribution of the scattered beam before it was absorbed in the M\u00f8ller\ncalorimeter. This mapping constituted the principal means of ensuring that\nthe beam was centrally aligned at the detector, and that the inner ring of\nM\u00f8ller electrons was clearly separated from the outer ring of e\u2013p electrons.\nThese measurements were critical for tuning the spectrometer during detector\ncommissioning.\nFigure 1 illustrates the essential features of these detectors. The active element\nwas a 5 \u2217 5 \u2217 20 mm3 piece of fused silica. This was oriented at an angle of\n45\u25e6 with respect to the incident beam in order to match the Cherenkov angle\nfor relativisitic electrons in fused silica. In order to increase the sensitivity of\nthe device, a rhombic 5 \u2217 15 \u2217 15 mm3 tungsten pre\u2013radiator was mounted\non the upstream side of the radiator. Cherenkov photons emerging from the\nend of the radiator were reflected along a tube lined with a reflective Alzak\n[2] foil until they were detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). For each\nbeam pulse the total charge collected on the PMT anode was digitized by the\nLeCroy 2249W ADC.\n3\n\n\fFig. 1. Schematic layout for measuring the spatial distribution of a broadly distributed intense beam. Cherenkov photons produced in the radiator are reflected to\na remotely located photomultiplier tube (PMT) by means of a air\u2013core light guide.\nBy closing the shutter, a measurement can be made of the background produced by\nionizing radiation striking the PMT.\n\n2.2 Design Considerations\n\nExtensive Monte\u2013Carlo simulations were made to optimize the design of the\ndetector. These revealed that even though the fused silica radiator was aligned\nto match the opening angle of the Cherenkov light cone, the overwhelming\nmajority of detected Cherenkov photons were multiply reflected inside the\nradiator. Because not all of these reflections proceeded by total internal reflection, wrapping the radiator in reflective foil increased the sensitivity of the\ndevice by about 10%.\nDue to the multiple reflections inside the radiator, Cherenkov photons emerge\nfrom the end of the radiator with a large range of angles. Simulations showed\nthat a reflector cone surrounding the end of the radiator would be effective\nin deflecting Cherenkov photons towards the PMT, thereby increasing the\nsensitivity of the device.\nTwo provisions were made to help identify and determine experimental backgrounds. First, as indicated in Fig. 1, an electromechanical shutter was installed immediately in front of the PMT. With the shutter open, reflected\nCherenkov photons could enter the PMT and interact in its photocathode.\nWhen shut, however, the shutter intercepted those photons permitting a measurement of the background due to ionizing radiation hitting the PMT. The\nsecond provision, not indicated in Fig. 1, was the capability of being able to\n4\n\n\fmove the pre\u2013radiator from the upstream to the downstream side of the radiator. This allowed us to ensure that the signal was due to the beam directly\nstriking the pre\u2013radiator, rather than from secondary interactions of the beam\nin other nearby components of our experimental setup.\nThe key variables affecting the sensitivity were the internal diameter and\nlength of the reflector lined tube, and the properties of the radiator, pre\u2013\nradiator, and reflecting surfaces. One concern was that rolling the Alzak sheet\nto form a small\u2013radius tubular light\u2013guide could degrade the 95% reflectivity\nspecified for our Alzak material. However, as indicated in Fig. 2, which compares measured and simulated [3] photon transmission in a 19 mm diameter\ntube of varying length, this concern was unfounded: a reflectivity of 93% gives\nexcellent agreement between experiment and theory.\n\nFig. 2. Relative transmission of light through a 19 mm diameter tube lined with\nreflective Alzak material. The light from a blue\u2013light emitting diode into a 30\u25e6\ncone was reflected from various lengths of the Alzak tube and measured using a\nphotomultipler tube (PMT). The points are data; the lines represent the results of\nsimulations with different reflectivity values.\n\nFigure 3 shows the simulated Cherenkov light collection as a function of light\nguide diameter and cone opening angle. Only photons in the wavelength range\n350 \u2013 440 nm were considered, corresponding to a quantum efficiency of 25%\nfor most photocathode materials. The photons were assumed to undergo specular reflection within the light\u2013guide cone and tube until they reached the\nPMT entrance window located 50 cm from the radiator. Photons that struck\n5\n\n\fthe PMT window at large angles of incidence failed to be transmitted through\nto the photocathode.\n\nFig. 3. Dependence of simulated light transmission on opening angle of mirror cone\nand diameter of a 50 cm long reflective tube. The calculations are for the wavelength\nrange 350 \u2013 440 nm.\n\nAs expected, for small tube diameters the calculated collection efficiency drops\ndue to the large number of reflections required for propagation along the full\nlength of the tube. The light collection generally has a broad maximum for\ncone opening angles of 35\u25e6 \u201360\u25e6 .\nAlthough large matching light guide and PMT diameters favor high collection\nefficiency, they also make the detector more susceptible to background arising\nfrom the flux of particles traversing the light guide between the radiator and\nPMT photocathode, as well as to secondary radiation interacting directly in\nthe PMT photocathode. In part, the corresponding signal\u2013to\u2013background ratio may be quantified by the ratio of the collection efficiency to the volume\nof the light guide or PMT window. An equivalent figure\u2013of\u2013merit, indicated\nin Fig. 4, is the collection efficiency divided by the square of the light guide\nor PMT diameter. The corresponding ratio is seen to be optimal for a PMT\ndiameter close to that of the 19 mm diameter tube used in our design. Somewhat different models for the background generation do not significantly alter\nthis conclusion.\nCherenkov and scintillation photons produced in the air contained within the\nlight guide constitute most of the background. In contrast to the Cherenkov\nphotons that are radiated at an angle of only 1.4\u25e6 in air relative to the initial\nelectron direction, scintillation photons are isotropically distributed. Using results of ref. [4], one can estimate that a minimum ionizing particle passing\nthrough one cm of air produces about 0.0066 photons/sr in the wavelength\n6\n\n\fFig. 4. Open points: Collection efficiency versus tube diameter for light propagation along a 50 cm\u2013long tube. Solid points: Collection efficiency divided by tube\ndiameter squared, arbitrarily normalized. This ratio constitutes a figure\u2013of\u2013merit\nfor the signal\u2013to\u2013background ratio, where the background is produced either within\nthe light guide tube, or in the PMT entrance window.\n\nrange matching the photomultiplier cathode sensitivity. Assuming a 2 sr solid\nangle of photon collection in the 19 mm diameter reflective\u2013tube and the 1.5\ncm average path of the electron traversing it, yields one scintillation photon\nreaching the PMT per about 20 passing electrons. This number should be\ncompared with about 200 Cherenkov photons reaching the PMT per electron passing through the radiator, as will be discussed, and is shown in Fig.\n6. Therefore under condition of uniform illumination, each cm of the tube\nwould contribute about 0.06% to the signal from the Cherenkov light produced within the radiator. This number is sufficiently low to assure that even\nwith an electron flux density varying by two orders of magnitude, the scintillation contribution from air in the light guide will not exceed a few percent.\nDue to the small angle of Cherenkov photons produced in air, Cherenkov\nradiation produced within the light guide was of little concern over most of\nthe length of the light guide tube: these photons just reflect back and forth,\ntransverse to the tube axis.\nOn the other hand, Cherenkov photons produced within the reflective cone\nadjacent to the radiator are not similarly trapped; such photons may \u2013 with\njust one or two reflections \u2013 enter the PMT window. Figure 5 shows the results\nof simulations of Cherenkov production in the radiator and in the air\u2013core light\n7\n\n\fguide under uniform electron flux irradiation for two light\u2013guide diameters,\n19 and 51 mm, assuming identical 5 \u2217 5 \u2217 20 mm3 radiators of fused silica.\nAs indicated, the larger diameter tube has a collection\u2013efficiency for light\nproduced in the radiator that is better by a factor of two. However, due to\nthe much smaller air volume within its cone, the background produced within\nthe light\u2013guide of the 19 mm diameter tube is smaller by about two orders\u2013\nof\u2013magnitude, a striking improvement of scanner flux profile resolution, well\nworth the cost of the reduced signal in the narrower tube.\n\nFig. 5. Results of simulations showing the position of origin of Cherenkov photons\nthat reach a PMT at the end of a 50 cm\u2013long light guide tube for two different\ntube diameters. The reflectivity of the tube is assumed to be 93%. The solid (open)\npoints are for a tube of internal diameter of 51 mm (19 mm).\n\nAs indicated in Fig. 6, the addition of the tungsten pre\u2013radiator immediately\nupstream of the fused quartz radiator makes the detector much more responsive. The signal\u2013to\u2013background ratio is similarly improved. In addition, the\npre\u2013radiator enhances the directionality of the detector response, making it\nrelatively insensitive to electron back\u2013splash and other off\u2013axis backgrounds.\nFinally, results of simulations shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate the uniformity of\nthe light collection as a function of the Cherenkov production position within\nthe radiator.\n8\n\n\fFig. 6.

The ordinate is the number of photons\nreaching the PMT per incident electron striking the pre\u2013radiator. The solid line\nshows the second order polynomial fit to the data.\n\n2.3 Construction\n\nFigure 8 shows the final version of the scanning Cherenkov detector that was\nbuilt for experiment E158. Cherenkov light was produced in a fused silica\nradiator measuring 5 \u2217 5 \u2217 20 mm3 , canted at an angle of 45\u25e6 to the incoming\nelectron beam. As noted above, the 45\u25e6 alignment of the quartz with respect\nto the beam served to optimize the response of the Cherenkov detector to the\nincoming beam and reduce sensitivity to background. Due to the high intensity\nof the scattered beam, the PMT that collects this Cherenkov light was situated\njust outside the E158 phase\u2013space, about 50 cm from the radiators.\nThe inner tube was aluminum, with an inner diameter of 20.5 mm and a\nwall thickness of 0.08 mm. It was lined with a rolled sheet of Alzak\u2013surfaced\naluminum. The sheet we used was difficult to roll because it was 0.3 mm thick;\nif available, thinner stock would be preferred.\nThe electromechanical shutter [5] had a circular aperture of 25.4 mm. Normally\nthe shutter was open, but when closed it allowed us to check for background\ngenerated by stray ionizing radiation directly hitting the 19 mm diameter PMT\n9\n\n\fFig. 7. Simulated light collection efficiency as a function of interaction position in\nquartz radiator. The position shown is the projection along the light\u2013guide axis.\n\n[6]. In order to reduce this background the sides of the PMT were shielded by\n4 cm of tungsten.\n\n2.4 Motion\n\nAs described above, in experiment E158 the electrons scattered from the protons and from the electrons in the hydrogen target formed two concentric\ncircular bands surrounding an intense forward\u2013directed bremsstrahlung background. In order to scan the two bands, Cherenkov detectors were positioned\n90\u25e6 apart on a rotatable annulus of outer diameter 246 cm as shown in Fig. 9.\nThe detectors were mounted on four linear movers [7] so that they could be\nmoved radially relative to the beam axis. The annulus could be rotated through\nan angle of 220\u25e6 thus allowing the entire profile of the scattered electrons to be\nmeasured. In order to avoid beam interception during the experimental runs,\nthe Cherenkov detectors were moved to a radial position beyond the scattered\nelectron beam.\nThe annulus [8] had an outside aluminum rim of 44 mm radial thickness and\n108 mm depth onto which was welded a 6 mm thick circular aluminum plate.\nFor ease of transport and flexibility in assembly, it separated into two halves\n10\n\n\fFig. 8. Final design for measuring spatial distribution of an intense, broadly distributed electron\u2013beam. In order to help identify and quantify background, a rotary\nactuator can move the pre\u2013radiator to a position immediately downstream of the\nfused quartz radiator. The background is also reduced by surrounding the PMT\nwith sintered tungsten shielding.\n\njoined together by fish plates and by tension blocks welded under the rim. The\nannulus was entrapped and supported by a pair of large brass bearing wheels,\nand was rotated by means of turning a sprocket wheel that engaged a roller\nchain fixed in a groove machined into the edge of the rim. The sprocket wheel\nitself was driven through a 20:1 reduction gear by a stepping motor mounted\non the support frame for the annulus. When assembled at SLAC with its full\ncomplement of detectors, the roundness of the annulus was measured to be\nbetter than 0.25 mm.\nThe annulus rotation and the linear translation of the Cherenkov scanners\nwere remotely controlled by means of a LabView Flexmotion [9] application.\nThe Cherenkov scanners were equipped both with optical rotary encoders for\nthe motion control, and with linear potentiometers [10] for providing position\ninformation into the data acquisition system.\n\n2.5 Performance\n\nThe scanner system worked well throughout the two\u2013year period of this experiment. Apart from the commissioning periods when it was used extensively,\nthe scanner was typically used for beam profile checks about twice each day.\n11\n\n\fFig. 9. Arrangement of four Cherenkov detectors on rotatable annulus. Linear\nmovers translate the detectors radially, while the annulus can be rotated 220\u25e6 by\nmeans of chain embedded in its rim. The annulus was supported on two large brass\nbearing wheels, and stabilized in the vertical plane by smaller bearings at about\n2/3 of the annulus height. The entire system was enclosed by a frame attached\nto a moveable cart that also provided earthquake protection. High\u2013voltage, signal,\nand motion control cables were bundled on both sides around the perimeter of\nthe annulus, and held on hangers at 15\u25e6 intervals so as to accommodate the cable\ntransport through the full 220\u25e6 rotation of the annulus. During experimental runs\na tungsten\u2013lead collimator was installed to intercept electrons scattered from the\nprotons.\n\nDespite the large integrated luminosity of this experiment, no degradation was\nobserved in the scanner performance. Fig. 10 shows results of radial scans during the E158 magnetic spectrometer commissioning, and a typical scan during\nthe production run. They are compared with the results of the GEANT Monte\nCarlo simulations of the spectrometer response. Very good agreement between\nmeasured scans and simulations gives account of a good control in simulations\nof all effects influencing the spectrometer performance.\n12\n\n\fFig. 10.

Panels\na) and b) show measurements (dots) and simulations (triangles) with quadrupole\nmagnets switched off and on, respectively, and a collimator inserted between the\ndipole and the quadrupole magnets. This collimator selected electrons scattered at\na fixed azimuthal angle. The focusing effect of the quadrupole magnets leading to\na separation of electrons scattered from electrons and protons is clearly seen. Panel\nc) shows scattered beam profile scan during a typical production run.\n\n13\n\n\f3\n\nCherenkov Polarimeter\n\n3.1 Introductory Remarks\nIn experiment E158 the polarization of the incident electron beam was determined by measuring M\u00f8ller scattering from magnetized iron foils mounted at\n20\u25e6 with respect to the beam and ranging in thickness between 20 and 100\n\u03bcm. For such thin targets, the M\u00f8ller count rate was reduced by a factor of\n200 compared to the rate from the 1.5 m long liquid hydrogen target used in\nthe experiment. In order to eliminate the e\u2013p background and define a certain kinematics acceptance, a collimator was used which limited the scattered\nbeam to an area of 7 x 1 cm2 in the detector plane. The M\u00f8ller calorimeter\nwas not suitable for polarimetry measurements because its size and geometry\ndid not match the collimator geometry. On the other hand, the reduction of\nthe scattered flux intensity would have made it difficult to acquire the desired\nprecision with the small scanning Cerenkov detector described in section 2.\nHence a second air\u2013core detector was designed that featured a much larger and\nthicker active element. Nevertheless, the overall concept for this polarimeter\nwas similar to that of the smaller air\u2013core Cerenkov scanners. As shown in\nFig. 11, the air\u2013core light guide of the polarimeter was a 10 cm internal diameter tube whose internal surface was lined with Alzak [2]. Cerenkov photons\nwere reflected around a 90\u25e6 angle in the tube by means of an Alzak\u2013surfaced\nrotatable mirror that could be set to bisect the angle between the horizontal\nand vertical tubes. This arrangement has two benefits. First, by rotating the\nmirror 180\u25e6 about a vertical axis, Cherenkov photons that would normally\nbe reflected towards the PMT were obstructed. This allowed a measurement\nof the background due to radiation interacting directly in the pmt. Effectively then, the rotatable mirror served the same function as the shutter in\nthe scanning Cherenkov detector. The second feature, a significant improvement over the more compact Cherenkov scanner, is that the 90\u25e6 angle in the\nlight\u2013guide permitted the photocathode of the PMT to be shielded from line\u2013\nof\u2013sight background originating in the vicinity of the beam pipe. In our case\nthe shielding was provided by 10 cm of lead surrounding the detector.\nThe active element of the polarimeter consisted of alternating layers of fused\nsilica and tungsten of total thickness of 13 radiation lengths.\n3.2 Design\nThe transverse size of the active element was optimized to match the 7 x 1\ncm2 image produced by special spectrometer optics used in the polarimetry\n14\n\n\fFig. 11. Air\u2013core Cherenkov detector installed on detector cart and used for polarimetry in experiment E158 at SLAC. Driven by a linear mover, the fused silica\u2013tungsten detector head can be moved vertically through a band of scattered electrons beneath the beam\u2013axis. Ten cm of lead shielded the PMT from line\u2013of\u2013sight\nbackground produced in the vicinity of the beam\u2013pipe.\n\nmeasurements. In order to allow for the transverse development of the electromagnetic shower within the detector, the size of the fused silica\u2013tungsten\nstack was made slightly larger than this. Each of the six fused silica plates\nmeasured 9.3 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm3 , and the tungsten plates, 7 in all, 9.8 x 3.5 x 0.6\ncm3 . As shown in Fig. 12, this stack was tilted relative to the beam by 30\u25e6 ,\nan angle calculated to optimize the response of the detector. The calculated\ndependence on angle is shown in Fig. 13. Extensive GEANT [3] Monte\u2013Carlo\ncalculations were made to optimize the details of the detector. These calculations guided the choice of the number and thicknesses of the fused silica and\ntungsten layers, as well as their orientation relative to the beam. In addition\nto the Alzak lining of the light\u2013guide tube, the simulations also favored the\nuse of reflective surfaces elsewhere in the detector. For example, calculations\nshowed that reflective foils laid against each fused silica plate increased the\nresponse of the detector by about 30%. The simulations also showed the ef15\n\n\fFig. 12. Arrangement of tungsten and fused silica layers in the active element of the\nair\u2013core polarimeter. Cherenkov photons generated by the electromagnetic shower\nreflect along the fused silica layers and emerge from the top. In the plane normal\nto this view, the photons are reflected close to the axis of the air\u2013core light guide\nby two planar semi\u2013elliptical reflectors, one above and the other below the detector\nelements. Alzak foils placed against each fused silica plate increased the response of\nthe detector by about 30%.\n\nficacy of two planar reflectors, semi\u2013elliptical in shape, installed above and\nbelow the detector element at an angle of 15\u25e6 to the tube axis. Cherenkov\nphotons emerging from the fused silica layers were reflected by these Alzak reflectors such that they followed paths more parallel to the axis of the air\u2013core\nlight guide. This reduced the number of reflections each ray underwent, thus\nimproving the light collection.\nThe adopted design provided not only large signal strength, but also the necessary energy resolution to discriminate against low energy backgrounds. As\nindicated in Fig. 14, the response of the calorimeter is also reasonably linear in\na range of 10\u2013100 GeV, though the relative signal drops considerably for low\nand for high energies. The drop at low energies aids in reducing background.\nFigure 15 shows two perspectives of the simulated response of the detector\nto the absorption of a 22 GeV electron. No shower products are shown other\nthan the Cherenkov photons. Moreover, for clarity, only 0.5% of the expected\nnumber of photons were simulated. The simulations, for a 1 m long straight\nair\u2013core light guide with a 10 cm internal diameter and a 10 cm phototube indicated that about 1800 Cherenkov photons reach the PMT for every 22 GeV\nM\u00f8ller electron absorbed in the detector. Because the constructed light guide\n16\n\n\fFig. 13. Calculated number of Cherenkov photons in the air\u2013core light\u2013guide, for a\nsingle 22 GeV electron showering in the detector stack. The response is calculated\nas a function of the angle between the incident beam and the normal to the fused\nsilica\u2013tungsten stack.\n\nwas 1.6 m long with a 90\u25e6 bend, and a 5 cm Hamamatsu PMT [11] was used,\nin practice, the yield was considerably lower. Moreover, the window material\nof the PMT was not of a type that favors high ultraviolet transmission, and\nhence a fraction of the Cherenkov photons were absorbed before reaching the\nPMT photocathode. However, these losses were considered acceptable in view\nof the large flux of M\u00f8ller\u2013scattered electrons incident upon the polarimeter\n(a few hundred electrons per 1011 electrons in the beam pulse).\n\n3.3 Some practical information\n\nThe rotatable mirror was fabricated by bolting a 6.3 mm thick brass plate\nto the 45\u25e6 \u2013beveled end of a 33 mm diameter aluminum shaft. By turning the\nshaft in a lathe, the plate was machined to the required elliptical profile. An\nAlzak foil was fixed to the brass plate to provide the reflective surface. The\nassembly was rotated by a 180\u25e6 pneumatic actuator [12], and limit switches\nwere added to indicate the mirror position.\nWhen not in use, the polarimeter was moved outside of the scattered beam\nregion. As for the Cherenkov scanners, this motion through a radial distance\n17\n\n\fFig. 14. Monte Carlo results for dependence of detector response on electron energy.\nThe response is quite linear for the 20\u201330 GeV energy\u2013range of M\u00f8ller\u2013scattered\nelectrons in experiment E158.\n\nof 0.5 m, was provided by a linear mover [7] equipped with limit and home\nswitches, and rotary and linear position encoders. The square rails of the linear\nmover were well\u2013suited for resisting the appreciable torque imposed by the 5\nkg of tungsten supported a distance of 85 cm off to the side of the mover's\naxis.\nAs with the Cherenkov scanners, the motion of the polarimeter was controlled\nby a National Instruments Flexmotion [9] with its linear potentiometer providing position information to the data acquisition system.\n\n3.4 Performance\n\nFigure 16 shows results for two radial scans for an unpolarized carbon target. One scan was made with the mirror set for transmission, the other for\nthe mirror obstructing Cherenkov photons. This lack of a sizeable signal in\nthe obstructed case confirms that background due to radiation interacting directly in the PMT was insignificant. Figure 17 shows the polarimeter response\ndistribution obtained using a polarized foil. In one case the beam polarization\nis aligned with the polarization of target electrons, (total helicity 1), in the\nother case the polarizations are opposite (total helicity 0). The response is nor18\n\n\fFig. 15. Monte Carlo simulation showing 0.5% of Cherenkov photons produced by\nthe showering of a single 22 GeV electron in the air\u2013core polarimeter.\n\nmalized according to the charge in each accelerator beam pulse, as measured\nby a toroidal coil. The difference in responses arises from the dependence of\nthe M\u00f8ller cross section on the total helicity. The data were used to determine the extent of the polarization of the incident electron beam. In our case\nthis ranged from 80\u201390%, with a statistical uncertainty of about 4% for a 20\nminute run.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe scanners described in the paper turned out to be very useful in commissioning the experiment and controlling properties of scattered beam and\nbackgrounds in the E158 detector system in which electron flux scattered from\nthe beam carrying \u223c 0.5MW of power was measured at an extremely small\nangle of \u223c0.3\u25e6 . The scanners were highly radiaton resistant and provided very\ngood spatial resolution of the flux profile. Knowledge of precise radial and azimuthal flux distributions was critical for good understanding of the detector\nsystem and minimizing backgrounds in the main calorimeter.\n19\n\n\fFig. 16.
