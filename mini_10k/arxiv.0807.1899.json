One example of the similarities between these two\ntypes of systems is the characteristic rapid X-ray variability seen from the accretion flow1. The power spectrum of\nthis variability in black hole binaries consists of a broad,\nband-limited noise with multiple quasi-periodic oscillations superimposed, where power is concentrated over a\nnarrow range of frequencies. Although the broad noise\ncomponent has been observed in many active galactic nuclei2,3, there are no significant detections of quasi-periodic\noscillations4\u20136. Here we report the discovery of a ~1h X-ray\nperiodicity in a bright active galaxy RE J1034+396. The\nsignal is highly statistically significant (at the 5.6\u03c3\n\u03c3 level)\nand very coherent, with quality factor Q > 16. This reinforces the link between stellar and supermassive black\nholes, emphasizing the universal properties of accretion\nonto objects with very different masses. The X-ray modulation arises from the direct vicinity of the black hole, so\nthis provides a new tool for studying active galactic nuclei.\nRE J1034+396 is a nearby (z = 0.042) active galaxy, spectroscopically classified as a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1).\nThese objects have strong emission lines produced by high\ndensity gas ionized by the UV and X-ray radiation from the\naccretion flow. These lines are rather narrow compared to the\nvelocity widths seen in more typical broad line active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). This fact, together with other evidence, has led\nto the suggestion that they host supermassive black holes less\nmassive than those inferred in a typical AGN of similar luminosity7.\nFrom a long (91 ks) observation using the X-ray satellite\nXMM-Newton we extracted a light curve for RE J1034+396\n(Fig. 1), over the energy band 0.3\u201310 keV. Even by eye it\nshows an evident periodic oscillation. To more rigorously test\nfor the presence of a periodic signal we folded the light curve\nwith various trial periods and analysed the root-mean-square\n(rms) amplitude of the resulting pulse profile as a function of\nthe period. We found a strong peak at 3730\u00b1130 s (FWHM).\nWe used the best-fitting period to plot the expected times of\nminima in Fig. 1. This shows that the periodicity changes its\ncharacter at around t0 = 25 ks. After that time the troughs in\nthe light curve follow the predicted minima very well, for\nalmost 16 cycles, indicating a highly coherent signal, but\nbefore t0 the troughs are shifted in phase and there are occasional additional minima. This shows that the feature is not a\ntrue periodicity, but that it wanders in phase, amplitude\nand/or frequency, as seen in the quasi-periodic oscillations\n(QPOs) in black hole binaries (BHB)8. Hence, we will refer\nto this signal as a QPO hereafter.\nWe concentrate first on the coherent part of the light curve\n(segment 2 in Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows this light curve segment\n1\n\nfolded with the best-fitting period, while Fig 3 shows its periodogram with a strong peak at ~2.7\u00d710-4 Hz. In order to\nquantify the statistical significance of the peak we adopt the\nmethod proposed by Vaughan9 to test the significance of periodicities against the red noise. This method involves dividing the periodogram by the best-fitting power law and using\nthe known distribution of the periodogram ordinates to estimate the likelihood of observing a given peak. The confidence limits (3\u03c3 and 99.99%) shown in Fig. 3 are calculated\nincluding the uncertainties in the red noise model. The QPO\nis well above these limits, and we find that it is statistically\nsignificant at the 1 \u2013 (2\u00d710-8) level (~5.6\u03c3). Even in the total\nlight curve, including segment 1 which has less obvious periodicity, the signal is still significant at the ~3.4\u03c3 level.\nThis method assumed that the underlying red noise has a\npower-law shape but there can be breaks in this continuum,\nchanging the derived significance of the QPO. We tested this\nwith Monte-Carlo simulations, generating a series of light\ncurves following a given power spectral distribution10. The\nsimulated light curves had the same number of bins, mean\ncount rate and variance, as the observed light curve. We then\ncalculated periodograms for each of them and found the\npower corresponding to the upper 3\u03c3 limit in each frequency\nchannel (the maximum significance in this method is 3.8\u03c3\n\nFigure 1 | XMM-Newton light curve of RE J1034+396. The start\ntime of this observation was 2007-05-31 20:10:12 UTC. We extracted source and background light curves from PN, MOS1 and\nMOS2 cameras in 0.3\u201310 keV energy band, using 45 arcsec circular\nselection regions and rejecting the final ~7 ks due to background\nflares. We then combined data from all cameras together. This gave\na mean count rate of 5.9\u00b10.6 and 0.04\u00b10.08 (s.d.) counts s-1 for the\nnet and background light curves, respectively. The data points,\nbinned in 100-s intervals, are plotted in gray. The error bars are 1\ns.d. The black thick curve represents the running average over 9 bins\naround a given bin and shows clear periodicity. The dotted vertical\nlines show the expected times of minima obtained from folding\nsegment 2 with the period of 3733 s. In this paper we mainly analyse\nsegment 2, showing a periodicity with high coherence. It contains\n593 contiguous 100-s bins and almost 16 full cycles of the periodic\nsignal. The fractional rms variability (in terms of excess variance21)\nin this segment is 9.2\u00b10.2%.\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK\n\n\fdue to the limited number of simulated light curves). The\nresults for a single power-law distribution with the index\ntaken from the best fit to our data (with index uncertainties\ntaken into account) are comparable to the analytical limits\nshown in Fig. 3, as expected. A broken power law with indices -1 and -2 below and above the break frequency of\n2.7\u00d710-4 Hz, respectively, decreases the confidence limits\naround the break, but the QPO remains highly significant\n(>3.8\u03c3). Therefore, we conclude that the observed signal at\n~2.7\u00d710-4 Hz in RE J1034+396 is significant at a very high\nstatistical level, irrespective of the assumed model for the\ncontinuum power.\nThe QPO lies within just one frequency bin of the periodogram, which makes it highly coherent, with a quality factor\nQ = f /\u2206f > 16, where f and \u2206f are the bin frequency and\nwidth, respectively. The rms fractional variability in the QPO\nis ~4.7% in the 0.3-10 keV energy band, which constitutes\nabout half of the rms variability in the light curve. The\nstrength of the QPO depends significantly on energy, increasing from ~2% in the 0.2\u20130.3 keV band, to ~10% above\n1 keV. There is a time lag of ~260 s in the QPO phase between 2\u201310 and 0.3\u20130.4 keV energy bands (softer X-rays\nlagging behind harder X-rays).\nThis is the first time such a strong QPO has been convincingly found in the X-ray light curve of any AGN. Earlier\nclaims all failed a more stringent statistical analysis4\u20136, such\nas that used here. The only exception was that claimed for\nNGC6814, which turned out to be from a Galactic cataclysmic variable (CV) along the line of sight11! However, XMMNewton is an imaging instrument and has a positional accuracy of ~2\u20133 arcsec, so considering that the number of X-ray\ndetected CVs is about a hundred12, the probability of a chance\nsuperposition with the AGN is vanishingly small, <10-8. We\ntherefore conclude that the X-ray source is associated with\nthe galaxy. Furthermore, its X-ray luminosity (4\u00d71043 erg s-1\nin 0.3\u201310 keV band) is then too bright for an ultra-luminous\nbinary X-ray source, which have luminosities below ~1041\nerg s-1. Therefore it must originate from the AGN.\nThe black hole mass in RE J1034+396 is not well determined, and different methods of measurement give conflicting results13.

Two cycles are plotted for clarity. The solid line represents the best-fitting sinusoid, the dotted line the mean count rate.\nThe amplitude of the sinusoid is ~6.7% of the mean which corresponds to ~4.7% of the fractional rms variability in the pulse profile.\n\n2\n\nline velocity dispersion in the broad-line region14 is\n6.3\u00d7105 M\u263c, and differs significantly from an estimate of\n3.6\u00d7107 M\u263c obtained using [OIII] as a proxy for the stellar\nvelocity dispersion in the bulge15. On the other hand, if the\nmass-velocity dispersion relation is different in NLS116 than\n\nFigure 3 | Power spectral distribution. Panel a shows the power\n\nspectrum (296 data bins), I(f), normalized to (rms/mean)2 per Hz,\ncalculated from segment 2 of the light curve (Fig. 1). The solid line\nis the de-biased9 best-fitting (least squares method) power law, P (f),\nwith index -1.35\u00b10.18. The fit excluded the data above 10-3 Hz,\ndominated by the white noise. We checked that a particular choice\nof the cut-off did not affect the significance of the peak. The dashed\ncurves represent the uncertainty in the power-law model. The dotted\nhorizontal line shows the expected level of the Poissonian noise. If\nP (f) represents the true power distribution (which is our null hypothesis) then the quantity 2I(f)/P (f) is scattered with \u03c72 distribution\nwith two degrees of freedom9,22. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nreturned the P value of ~84%, so the null hypothesis is not rejected\nat the significance level of, e.g., \u03b1 = 5%. This shows that a single\npower law is a good description of the underlying noise process. We\nalso confirm this by Monte Carlo simulations, which allow us to\nestimate 1 s. d. errors in each frequency channel and calculate \u03c7 2\u03bd =\n68.4 at 58 degrees of freedom. We use the \u03c72 distribution of 2I(f)/P\n(f) to calculate the confidence limits on the suspected periodic signal. Panel b shows 2I(f)/P (f) together with 3\u03c3 (99.73%) and 99.99%\nconfidence limits. The same confidence limits are also plotted in\npanel a. We see that the periodic signal at ~2.7\u00d7104 Hz is very\nstrong, significant at a level in excess of 99.99% (the actual significance level is ~5.6\u03c3). The significances are global, i.e. corrected for\nthe number of frequencies tested. This result is confirmed by Monte\nCarlo simulations. The periodic signal is also highly significant in\nthe individual light curves extracted from each separate X-ray camera.\n\n\fin broad-line galaxies14, then the latter mass measurement\nmay be overestimated. Our observed periodicity, if it is related to the Keplerian period of the innermost circular stable\norbit, would correspond to the central mass between 8\u00d7106\nand 9\u00d7107 M\u263c, for a non-rotating and maximally rotating\nblack hole, respectively.\nGalactic BHB show a huge variety of QPOs, differing in\nfrequency, power and coherence17. Generally, they can be\ndivided into the low- and high-frequency QPOs, with frequencies <50 and >100 Hz, respectively. The strongest and\nmost coherent low-frequency QPOs are typically seen at frequencies <10 Hz, which, when scaled to the frequency of\n2.7\u00d710-4 Hz reported here, would imply a black hole mass of\nless than ~4\u00d7105 M\u263c in RE J1034+396. Given the observed\nbolometric luminosity (dominated by the soft X-ray/far UV\ncomponent) of ~5\u00d71044 erg s-1, such a low mass requires that\nthe system is radiating at about 10 times the Eddington limit\n(LEdd).\nHigh-frequency QPOs are occasionally seen in several\nBHB with high coherence8. They sometimes occur in pairs\nwith the frequency ratio of 3:28. These frequencies appear to\nbe stable and are regarded as a signature of strong gravity in\nthe vicinity of a rotating black hole18. A tentative frequencymass relation, f0 = 931 (M/M\u263c)-1 Hz, can be derived from\nthree objects8. Here f0 is the fundamental frequency of the\npair, i.e. the observed frequencies are 2f0 and 3f0 (the fundamental is not seen). This relation yields the black hole mass\nin RE J1034+396 of 6.9\u00d7106 or 1.0\u00d7107 M\u263c, depending on\nwhether the observed periodicity corresponds to 2f0 or 3f0,\nrespectively. This would imply a luminosity of 0.5 or 0.3\nLEdd, respectively. All this clearly shows that better mass estimates (e.g. reverberation mapping or accurate stellar velocity dispersion) are required for RE J1043+396 before the\nQPO type can be uniquely identified.\nFinally we should ask why RE J1034+396 is unique in\nshowing the first convincing evidence for a QPO, given that\nmany AGN have comparable quality X-ray data and have\nbeen monitored for similar or longer timescales. Perhaps we\nare exceptionally lucky in detecting a QPO with a small duty\ncycle (the high-frequency QPO in BHB is seen only occasionally). Alternatively, it may be connected to the fact that\nRE J1034+396 is extreme even amongst NLS1, with an unusual spectral energy distribution peaking in the far UV19,20.\nThis component extends into the soft X-ray band pass, but\nnot to the harder X-rays where the QPO is seen. Thus the far\nUV/soft X-ray component cannot be directly responsible for\nthe QPO signal, but it may indicate that RE J1034+396 has\nan extreme mass accretion rate and that this drives both the\nunusual spectrum and the QPO.\nQPOs remain enigmatic, but they clearly contain information about the dynamics of the infalling material. The larger\nmass of an AGN means that we see fewer cycles of a QPO,\nbut with much higher time resolution compared to BHB.\nTherefore, future studies of such phenomena in AGN will\nshed new light on the origin of QPOs, and in turn, our understanding of accretion flows around black holes.\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n\n21.\n22.\n\nEdelson, R., Nandra, K.
