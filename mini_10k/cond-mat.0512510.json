INTRODUCTION\nThe complex electronic phase diagrams of many transition metal (TM) oxide systems,\nfor instance the intensely studied perovskite-type manganites Ln1-xAxMnO3 [1,2], reflect a\nsituation where the width of the conduction band, the electron correlation energy, and the\nstrength of the electron-phonon coupling are of comparable magnitude. If two electronic\nphases are separated by a first-order transition, phase coexistence is often observed over a\nrange of compositions, and the volume fractions can be changed by varying the composition,\ntemperature, pressure, or magnetic field. This situation is encountered in the colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR) manganites, where the ferromagnetic metallic state is stabilized by\na magnetic field with respect to competing charge ordered antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic\ninsulating states [3,4]. As a baseline for a description of the properties of the CMR\nmanganites, it is helpful to consider the electronic structure of the prototype undoped parent\ncompound LaMnO3, which contains only Mn3+ ions with a t2g3eg1 high spin configuration.\nSince the lowest energy optical excitations in LaMnO3 were assigned to intersite d-d\ntransitions [5], LaMnO3 can be considered as a Mott-Hubbard type insulator. Both, t2g and eg\nelectrons are localized, and the t2g3eg1 electron configuration gives rise to a cooperative JahnTeller effect. This is the origin of orbital ordering (TOO ~ 750 K) [6] and of the type-A\nantiferromagnetic spin structure (TN = 140 K) [7]. Hole doping of LaMnO3 leads to the\nformation of Mn4+ (t2g3) ions. The double exchange (DE) mechanism, which favors\ndelocalization of the eg electrons if the t2g spins are ferromagnetically aligned, then stabilizes a\nferromagnetic metallic state. Depending on the composition and structural details, however,\nvarious charge-ordered antiferromagnetic states have also been observed.\nIn order to improve our understanding of the physical properties of the manganites, it\nis interesting to consider iron(IV) based oxides, because the Fe4+ ion is isoelectronic with the\nMn3+ ion. In contrast to LaMnO3 the prototype Fe(IV) oxide SrFeO3 is metallic and exhibits a\ncubic perovskite structure at all temperatures, without any evidence of a Jahn-Teller effect\n[8,9]. The different properties of Fe(IV) compared to Mn(III) oxides reflect the strongly\nenhanced covalency of iron(IV)-oxygen bonding, which is in agreement with the chemical\ntrend that the M 3d orbitals are stabilized from the left to the right in a TM series and with\nincreasing oxidation state for a given M. This is corroborated by band structure calculations of\nSrFeO3 [10] as well as by comparative band structure calculations of CaFeO3 and LaMnO3\n[11]. The larger covalency leads to a larger width of the conduction band which is formed\nfrom the V* (Fe 3d \u2013 O2p) antibonding eg orbitals. The increased itinerancy of the eg electrons\nexplains the absence of the Jahn-Teller effect in SrFeO3 and related compounds. Basic\n2\n\n\felectronic structure parameters of SrFeO3 were derived from the analysis of Fe 2p core level\nspectra within a cluster configuration interaction model [12]. Within this approach, the strong\ncovalency of the Fe-O bonding results in a negative effective charge transfer energy ', which\nis the energy difference between the lowest lying states arising from the d4 and d5L multiplets.\nThis means that the electronic ground state of Fe(IV) oxides is dominated by the d5L rather\nthan the ionic d4 configurations. Here L denotes a hole in the oxygen 2p orbitals.\nOverall, the electronic situation in single-valent SrFeO3 appears to be comparable to\nthat in mixed-valent manganites. In both cases the DE mechanism favors the delocalization of\nthe eg electrons, which are coupled to the localized t2g3 subshell. In contrast to the manganites,\nno doping is required, and the itinerancy of the eg electrons is bandwidth-driven in SrFeO3.\nHowever, the charge carriers have a larger O 2p hole character. While it might be expected\nthat the DE mechanism results in a ferromagnetic metallic state for SrFeO3, the compound\nactually undergoes a phase transition from a paramagnetic to a helicoidal magnetic state near\n130 K [13,14]. This was originally explained by a competition between antiferromagnetic\nsuperexchange and DE interactions. Recently this view has been challenged, and it was shown\nby model calculations that for negative ' the DE mechanism alone is capable of stabilizing an\nincommensurate helical spin structure [15]. The metallic state found in SrFeO3 becomes\nunstable with respect to a charge disproportionation of Fe4+ into Fe(4\u0001\n\n)+\n\n(\"Fe3+\") and Fe(4+\n\u0001\n\n)+\n\n(\"Fe5+\"), if the V \u0003bandwidth is somewhat reduced. This situation occurs in the distorted\nperovskite CaFeO3 [16], where an intricate interplay between lattice distortions and\ncorrelation effects [17] leads to charge ordering (TCO = 290 K) [18] and the opening of a band\ngap. Remarkably, the helical spin structure (TN = 115 K) is not much influenced by the\ninsulator-metal transition driven by replacing Sr with Ca. This can also be understood as a\nconsequence of the negative '\u0003in these materials [15].\nThe above considerations show that in iron(IV) based oxides spin-dependent electron\ndelocalization processes as well as electron-lattice interactions are important. This has\nmotivated a search for CMR effects akin to those observed in the manganites. It turned out\nthat a successful route to large MR effects in Fe(IV) materials is the partial substitution of\niron by cobalt or nickel, which stabilizes ferromagnetic ordering. MR effects up to -65% at 4\nK and 5 T have been achieved in the systems SrFe1-xCoxO3- [19,20], Sr3Fe2-x(Co,Ni)xO7- [21\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n- 25], and Sr2/3La1/3Fe1-xCoxO3- [26]. Recently, Zhao et al. reported a sizable MR effect of up\n\u0001\n\nto -15% at 4 K and 9 T even for unsubstituted polycrystalline SrFeO2.95 [27]. This effect is\napparently related to an anomaly in the resistivity data near 55 K, which can be shifted by a\n\n3\n\n\fmagnetic field. The resistivity anomaly in turn appeared to be correlated with an anomaly near\n65 K in magnetic susceptibility data and the appearance of paramagnetic Fe(3+\n\u0001\n\n)+\n\nsites in the\n\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectra for T \u0095\u0003 \u001b\u0013\u0003 .\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003 LV\u0003 EHORZ\u0003 \u0003 WKH\u0003 1pHO\u0003 WHPSHUDWXUH\u0003 LQ\u0003 WKH\u0003 6U)H22.95\nsample). In the light of earlier neutron diffraction experiments on SrFeO2.90 [14], it was\nproposed that a modification of the pitch angle of the helical spin structure or a magnetic-field\ninduced change from the helical to a conical spin structure could be reasons for the observed\nmagnetotransport effects.\nIn contrast to manganites and the cobalt- or nickel-substituted ferrates, the MR effect\nin SrFeO2.95 does not involve a ferromagnetic state. It is therefore of fundamental interest to\nunderstand its microscopic origin. Since previous experience with the manganites has shown\nthat the coexistence of different phases can have a key influence on the physical properties\n[3,4], it is essential to consider the exact phase compositions in the investigated samples. It is\nknown that the structural phase diagram of the SrFeO3- system encompasses four phases,\n\u0001\n\nnamely the stoichiometric cubic phase (C, G = 0) as well as the oxygen vacancy ordered\n\ntetragonal (T, G = 0.125, Sr8Fe8O23), orthorhombic (O, G = 0.25, Sr4Fe4O11), and\n\nbrownmillerite-type (B, G = 0.5, Sr2Fe2O5) phases separated by miscibility gaps [28]. Other\ncompositions correspond to phase mixtures. In order to investigate the magnetotransport\nproperties in the system SrFeO3- in more detail and to establish the relation to magnetic and\n\u0001\n\ncharge ordering, we have conducted a systematic study of a series of SrFeO3- single crystals\n\u0001\n\nwith different oxygen contents (G \u0094\u0003 \u0013\u0011\u0015\u0018 \u0011\u0003 6RPH\u0003 KLJhlights of our work have already been\ncommunicated [29]. Here we report a comprehensive set of magnetotransport data, as well as\nM\u00f6ssbauer, Raman, and optical reflectivity spectra, which enable us to give a detailed account\nof the relationship between the phase compositions, the magnetic and charge ordering\ntransitions, and the magnetotransport properties. In particular, it is shown that depending on\nthe phases present different types of magnetoresistance phenomena occur in this system. A\nlarge negative MR is observed in cubic SrFeO3, which is associated with a transition seen\nnear 55 K in the magnetic as well as in the resistivity data. A giant negative MR related to a\ncombined magnetic/charge ordering transition near 70 K is found for SrFeO2.85, a material\nwith the tetragonal phase as the major component. Finally, a large positive MR effect at low\ntemperatures is evident in samples with further increased oxygen deficiency. In the light of\nour results, we reconsider the data reported by Zhao et al. and argue that the properties of their\nsample should be interpreted in terms of a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases.\n\n4\n\n\fThe paper is structured as follows. In order to support the interpretation of our\nexperimental findings, the most important structural features of the system SrFeO3- are\n\u0001\n\nsummarized in Section II. In Section III the experimental details are given. In Section IV\nM\u00f6ssbauer, magnetotransport, and optical data are presented. Finally, Section V offers some\nConcluding Remarks.\n\nII. SUMMARY OF STRUCTURAL DATA\nThe known phases in the system SrFeO3- can be described by the general formula\n\u0001\n\nSrnFenO3n-1 with n = \u0092\u000f\u0003 \u001b\u000f\u0003 \u0017\u000f\u0003 \u0015\u0011\u0003 7KHLU\u0003 FU\\VWDO\u0003 VWUXFWXUHV\u0003 ZHUH\u0003 VWXGLHG\u0003 SUHYLRXVO\\\u0003 DW\u0003 URRP\u0003\ntemperature by powder neutron diffraction [28]. The n = \u0092\u0003PHPEHU\u00036U)H23 adopts the cubic\n\nperovskite structure (space group Pm-3m) with a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing\nregular FeO6 octahedra. The other members of the series correspond to oxygen vacancyordered defect perovskites. The iron-oxygen distances are summarized in Table 1, the crystal\nstructures of tetragonal Sr8Fe8O23 (n = 8, space group I4/mmm) and orthorhombic Sr4Fe4O11\n(n = 4, space group Cmmm) are illustrated in Fig. 1. The iron-oxygen network in Sr8Fe8O23\ninvolves three different types of iron sites Fe1, Fe2, and Fe3 with a relative abundance of\n1:2:1. The Fe1 sites are in an approximate square pyramidal environment of oxygen atoms,\nwhereas the Fe2 and Fe3 sites are six-fold coordinated. Similar to the cubic perovskite\nstructure, all polyhedra are connected via corner-sharing of oxygen atoms. However, oxygen\ndeficiency leads to the formation of Fe1O5 square pyramids, two of which form dimers via\nsharing of the O1 atom. The pyramids are connected only to distorted Fe2O6 octahedra, which\nthemselves are connected to all other types of polyhedra. The Fe3O6 octahedra are nearly\nregular and form rows along the c-direction. Each of these rows is surrounded by four\ncolumns of Fe2O6 units. The Fe3-O distances are very similar to those in SrFeO3, and the Fe3\nsites are readily attributed to Fe4+. The Fe-O distances in the FeO5 units of Sr8Fe8O23 are more\nthan 0.1 \u00c5 shorter than those in Sr3Fe2O6 (4 u 1.98 \u00c5, 1 u 1.92 \u00c5) [30], the crystal structure of\nwhich contains only five-fold coordinated Fe3+ ions. Thus the Fe1 sites are also assigned to\nFe4+, whereas the remaining Fe2 sites are attributed to the Fe3.5+ species. The presence of the\nlatter is supported by the intermediate Fe2-O distances and the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of\nSr8Fe8O23 [31,32].\nOnly two iron sites are present in the crystal structure of Sr4Fe4O11 [28]. Again, dimers\nof Fe1O5 units are formed. These are connected to rows of strongly distorted Fe2O6\noctahedra. The bond distances of the square pyramids are similar to those in Sr8Fe8O23.\n\n5\n\n\fTherefore the Fe1 sites again correspond to Fe4+, whereas the large Fe-O distances in the\nFe2O6 octahedra are in accord with an assignment as Fe3+. This was concluded previously on\nthe basis of bond valence calculations [28] whose validity has, however, been questioned in\ncourse of a recent neutron diffraction study on Sr4Fe4O11 [33]. Considering a possible JahnTeller effect of Fe4+ it was proposed that the distorted Fe2O6 octahedra should be associated\nwith the Fe4+ sites and the square pyramids with the Fe3+ sites. We discard this possibility as it\nis in clear contradiction to the known bond distances in perovskite-type Fe3+ and Fe4+ oxides\n(see above). Furthermore, due to strong covalency of iron-oxygen bonding the Jahn-Teller\neffect of Fe4+ is usually suppressed.\nFinally we mention the brownmillerite-type crystal structure of the pure Fe3+ phase\nSr2Fe2O5 (n = 2 space group Icmm [28] or Ibm2 [34]) where alternating layers of tetrahedrally\nand octahedrally coordinated iron sites occur.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe experiments were performed on high quality SrFeO3- single crystals synthesized\n\u0001\n\nin a four-mirror type floating zone furnace [35]. The oxygen contents were determined to an\naccuracy of a0.02 by thermogravimetry (TG) in a reducing Ar/H2 atmosphere (H2 content 5\n\nat.%). As-grown oxygen-deficient crystals with G\u0003= 0.13, 0.15, 0.19 and 0.23 were obtained\n\nunder different growth conditions, depending upon applied oxygen pressure and growth rate.\nNearly stoichiometric SrFeO3.00 and slightly oxygen-deficient SrFeO2.95 were prepared by\npost-annealing at 400\u00b0C under high oxygen pressure of 5 kbar and 700 - 800 bar, respectively.\nA more strongly oxygen-deficient sample of composition SrFeO2.69 was obtained by postannealing at 550\u00b0C in argon flow. In the following the samples will be labeled according to\nthe oxygen contents determined by TG. An independent check of oxygen stoichiometries as\nwell as an estimate of the phase compositions was derived from M\u00f6ssbauer spectra (Section\nIV.A).\nThe magneto-transport characterization was performed with a PPMS system (Quantum\nDesign). For measurements of the electrical resistivity, U, the crystals were cut and oriented\nalong (100) faces, Cr/Au electrodes were deposited in a four-point contact geometry, and gold\nleads were glued on the electrodes with silver epoxy. The susceptibility curves were recorded\nin Field Cooling (FC) and subsequent Field Heating (FH) runs, with a 1T field. The electrical\nresistivities were measured in ac-mode in Zero Field Cooling (ZFC) and subsequent Zero\nField Heating (ZFH), this was followed by FC and FH runs at 9T. The zero-field and in-field\n\n6\n\n\fruns\n\nwere compared\n\nMR (U(H)\u0010 U(0))\n\nU(0)\n\nto\n\nobtain\n\nthe MR.\n\nWe adopt\n\nthe following definition:\n\n. Isothermal field scans were recorded near the temperature of the\n\nanomalies observed in FC and FH runs. For this series of measurements, the sample was first\nheated to room temperature and subsequently cooled to the required temperature in zero field.\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectra were measured with a standard spectrometer operating with a sinetype drive signal. The source was\n\n57\n\nCo in a Rh matrix. For the M\u00f6ssbauer investigations,\n\ncrystals of the different SrFeO3- compositions were ground, and the resulting powder was\ndiluted with polyethylene in order to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the material in the\nplexiglass sample container. The container was placed in an Oxford flow cryostat. The spectra\nnormally were evaluated by fitting Lorentzians to the data. Spectra of magnetically ordered\nphases were evaluated with six-line patterns. Spectra of magnetically ordered SrFeO3 were\nevaluated with the Voigt based fitting algorithm of the M\u00f6ssbauer software package\n\" RECOIL\" [36]. The intensity ratios were taken as 3:2:1:1:2:3 (thin absorber approximation).\nAll spectra are referenced to D-iron.\nThe Raman spectra were collected with incident light of wavelength 514.5 nm emitted\nby mixed gas Ar/Kr lasers on two triple-monochromator DILOR spectrometers. The\nspectrometers were equipped with identical charge coupled device (CCD) detectors cooled\nwith liquid N2. The spectra were calibrated at each temperature using the lines of an argon\nlamp. The samples SrFeO3.00 and SrFeO2.85 were studied in macro-Raman mode, while\nSrFeO2.69 was studied in micro-Raman mode. Great care was taken to focus on the same point\nin the whole temperature range. All samples investigated were cut along the <001> directions\nand they had a mirror-like finish.\nThe ellipsometric measurements were performed with a home-built ellipsometer in\ncombination with a fast-Fourier-transform interferometer at the infrared beamline of the\nANKA synchrotron at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany [37].\n\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIV.A M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy\nRoom temperature spectra\nIn Fig. 2 room temperature M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of various SrFeO3- samples studied in\nthis work are shown. By comparison with literature data [31,32], the spectra can be used to\n\n7\n\n\fidentify the different phases present. The spectrum of the 5 kbar annealed sample essentially\nconsists of a single line with an isomer shift IS which is typical for stoichiometric cubic\nSrFeO3 (C phase). On the other hand, the spectrum of SrFeO2.95 reveals an additional\nquadrupole doublet with a higher IS. This indicates the presence of the tetragonal (T) phase\nSr8Fe8O23 and can be assigned to an average charge Fe3.5+ signal arising from the structurally\ndistorted Fe2 sites. The spectrum of SrFeO2.87 mainly reflects the features of the T phase and\nconsists of the Fe3.5+ quadrupole doublet in addition to an Fe4+ single line. As the lowtemperature spectra reveal also some C phase (see below), the Fe4+ single line in the spectrum\nof SrFeO2.87 is attributed to a superposition of the Fe1 and Fe3 sites of the T phase and Fe4+\nsites of cubic SrFeO3. An additional Fe3+ doublet with a much larger quadrupole splitting in\nthe spectrum of SrFeO2.81 is a signature of the structurally distorted Fe3+ (Fe2) sites in the\ncrystal structure of orthorhombic (O) Sr4Fe4O11. Accordingly, SrFeO2.81 corresponds to a\nmixture of the T phase as majority and the O phase as minority components. As expected, the\nsample with composition SrFeO2.69 contains the O phase as its main constituent. This is again\napparent from the characteristic M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum. In addition to the Fe3+ quadrupole\ndoublet, a second doublet with a smaller quadrupole splitting is apparent. Based on its IS\nvalue, it is assigned to the square pyramidal Fe4+ (Fe1) sites in the crystal structure of the O\nphase. Two further weak lines in the spectrum of SrFeO2.69 are the inner components of\nsextets arising from magnetically ordered Sr2Fe2O5. These additional lines are more readily\nseen in spectra measured over an extended range of Doppler velocities. Quantitative estimates\nof oxygen stoichiometries and phase fractions as well as details about magnetic and charge\nordering phenomena are obtained from the temperature dependence of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra\nof the various materials, described below. Selected M\u00f6ssbauer parameters and the sample\ncompositions derived from data are given in Table 2.\n\nSrFeO3.00\nFrom the absence of any Fe3+ or Fe3.5+ signals in the low and room temperature\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectra of 5kbar annealed SrFeO3.00 we had concluded that this sample is\nstoichiometric (G < 0.02) [29]. In order to clarify the origin of anomalies in the magnetic and\nmagnetotransport data near 55 K (see Ref. [29] and Section IV.B), we have now performed a\ndetailed M\u00f6ssbauer study of the SrFeO3.00 sample in the temperature range 10 to 130 K.\nConsidering the pronounced hysteresis effects in the magnetotransport data, M\u00f6ssbauer\nexperiments have been performed in the heating as well as in the cooling mode. A selection of\nspectra is shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the spectra confirm the development of magnetic\n8\n\n\fordering below 130 K, indicated by six-line hyperfine patterns. Similar to the 10 K spectrum\nshown in Ref. [29], all spectra at T d 60 K consist only of a single sextet, with isomer shifts IS\nand magnetic hyperfine fields Bhf in good agreement with earlier M\u00f6ssbauer data of SrFeO3\n[31]. Within the error limits (about 2%) there is no indication of additional Fe sites in these\nspectra. Up to 60 K no major changes are seen. However, at somewhat higher temperature\nbetween 60 and 70 K some intensity near v = 0 mm s-1 starts to emerge (v is the velocity of\nthe M\u00f6ssbauer drive), and between 70 and 90 K a certain fraction of a paramagnetic signal\nbecomes apparent. Furthermore, above 60 K the outer lines of the magnetic sextet become\nasymmetric, and the lines broaden progressively up to 125 K. At 130 K, a single line spectrum\nis seen, which means that the Npel temperature for the present sample lies between 125 and\n130 K. This is somewhat lower than the literature value TN = 134 K for cubic SrFeO3 [9]. At\nfirst glance the spectra of the paramagnetic phase consist of a single line. However, detailed\ninspection of the room temperature spectrum (Fig. 2) indicates a weak shoulder towards\nhigher Doppler velocities.\nConsidering the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of SrFeO2.87 and SrFeO2.95 (see below), it appears\nlikely that the occurrence of paramagnetic sites between 70 and 90 K as well as the small\nasymmetry in the room temperature spectrum indicate the presence of small regions of\ntetragonal SrFeO3- even in the 5kbar annealed sample. In fact, the room temperature\nspectrum (Fig. 2) can be fitted by one Fe4+ single line and a 4% contribution of Fe3.5+ sites.\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer parameters of the latter sites were taken from a sample with increased oxygen\ndeficiency, where the presence of the T phase is more obvious. Using the common oxidation\nstates +2 and \u20132 for the Sr and O atoms, respectively, one obtains a sample composition\nSrFeO2.99 which is within the error limit \u00b10.02 for G derived from the TG data. At low\ntemperatures the Fe3.5+ sites in the tetragonal domains are expected to reveal charge\nlocalization (see below). The resulting 2% contribution of magnetically ordered Fe3+ sites is,\nhowever, at the detection limit of the low temperature M\u00f6ssbauer spectra.\nIt is apparent that the inner lines of the hyperfine sextets are narrower than the outer\nones. This suggests that the line broadening above 60 K reflects a distribution of magnetic\nhyperfine fields. Accordingly the spectra were evaluated with a Voigt-based fitting algorithm\n[36]. In order to account for the asymmetry of the line shapes, a Bhf distribution with two\ncomponents was required: a major sharper and a minor broader one. The Bhf distributions at\nselected temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. In the spectra at T t 70 K one Fe3.5+ quadrupole\ndoublet and one Fe4+ singlet were added to account for the paramagnetic fraction. This model\n\n9\n\n\fyields a reliable description of the spectral shapes (see Fig. 3). The area fraction of the\nmagnetically ordered Fe4+ sites (Fig. 5) decreases between 60 and 90 K, and changes only\nslightly upon further heating to 125 K. This means that the minority phase undergoes\nmagnetic ordering near 70 K, which is similar to the Npel temperature of tetragonal SrFeO3- .\nThe area fraction of the paramagnetic phase at 110 K is ~6% and is composed of 3% Fe3.5+\nand 3% Fe4+ sites. These values are in reasonable agreement with the area fractions at room\ntemperature. It is noted that the area fractions from spectra measured in the heating mode\ncompare well with those from spectra measured in the cooling mode. Accordingly, there is no\nevidence of a hysteresis in the M\u00f6ssbauer data. In Fig. 6 the temperature dependence of the\nmean values <Bhf> for the two components in the hyperfine field distribution is shown. The\nminor broad component 2 reveals a more pronounced temperature dependence than the major\nsharper component 1 and accounts for the increasing asymmetry of the spectra. The\ntemperature dependence <Bhf>(T) of component 1 was reproduced by the relation\n<Bhf(T)>/<Bhf(0)> = (1-T/TN) with <Bhf(0)> = 33.5 T, TN = 126.9 K, E = 0.16.\nIn summary, the detailed M\u00f6ssbauer study of the 5 kbar annealed sample SrFeO3.00\nindicates the presence of a small amount of oxygen vacancies (G ~ 0.01) which are\nconcentrated in more strongly oxygen-deficient domains with a behavior similar to that of\nbulk tetragonal SrFeO3- . These domains are embedded in the majority cubic perovskite\nmatrix. In the light of these results the question arises whether the 55 K transition in the\nmagnetic and magnetotransport data (see [29] and Sect. IV.B) is an intrinsic property of pure\ncubic SrFeO3, or rather related to phase inhomogeneity on a submicroscopic level. The\ntransition in the magnetic and magnetotransport data occurs at somewhat lower temperature\nthan the minority magnetic phase transition in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra. In addition there is no\nevidence for hysteresis effects in the M\u00f6ssbauer area fractions whereas a quite pronounced\nhysteresis is observed in the magnetotransport anomaly. These findings suggest that the two\ntransitions are of different origin. This conclusion is also supported by the M\u00f6ssbauer and\nmagnetotransport data of SrFeO2.95, a sample with increased fraction of T phase (see below).\nFinally, we point out that the magnetic susceptibility of a SrFeO3 sample annealed under even\nhigher oxygen pressure is nearly identical to that of the sample annealed under 5 kbar [38]. In\nparticular, the anomaly near 60 K is undiminished while the paramagnetic signals in the\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectra between 70 and 130 K are absent. This underscores our conclusion that it\nis an intrinsic feature of the cubic phase.\n\n10\n\n\fSrFeO2.87\nIn order to establish the properties of the T phase, we now turn to the M\u00f6ssbauer\nspectra of SrFeO2.87. The spectra shown in Fig. 7 provide evidence of two magnetic phase\ntransitions, in agreement with magnetic susceptibility data of the same sample. The magnetic\nsusceptibility curve of the SrFeO2.87(2) crystal is very similar to that of the SrFeO2.85(2) sample\nused in magnetotransport and optical experiments (Sections IV.B and IV.C below). The first\ntransition below TN1~130 K leads to a single hyperfine sextet D (area fraction ~20%), with\nisomer shifts IS and a temperature dependence of the magnetic hyperfine field Bhf (T) (Fig. 9)\ntypical for cubic SrFeO3. Near TN2 ~ 70 K, a second magnetic phase transition occurs. The\ncomplicated but well-structured low-temperature spectra were modeled by a superposition of\nfive (15 K) or six (>15 K) hyperfine sextets. A typical decomposition is illustrated in Fig. 8\nfor 50 K, and the results of the data evaluation are depicted in Fig. 9. From Bhf (T) it is\nevident that the magnetic order for all components except D vanishes near 70 K. Thus all sites\nexcept D are considered as intrinsic to the T phase. Based on the IS and Bhf values, charge\nstates of 3+ , 4+, and 3.5+ are assigned to the sub-spectra (A,B), (D,E,F), and C, respectively.\nConsidering the low-temperature area fractions and assuming equal Debye-Waller factors for\nthe various Fe sites, this leads to an average iron oxidation state of 3.74 and an oxygen\ncontent of 2.87 (G = 0.13), in agreement with the TG data. Above 130 K, SrFeO2.87 is\ncompletely in the paramagnetic state. Following previous work [31,32], the spectra were\nanalyzed in terms of two components only: one Fe4+ single line, and one average charge Fe3.5+\nquadrupole doublet. The area fraction of the Fe3.5+ sites decreases from ~55% in the\nparamagnetic phase to a residual fraction of about 10% in the magnetically ordered phase.\nThis suggests that the magnetic ordering near 70 K coincides with charge ordering (CO) of\nmost of the Fe3.5+ into Fe3+ and Fe4+ sites. A charge disproportionation of Fe4+, as for instance\nin CaFeO3 [16], should lead to higher Fe3+ area fractions and is therefore excluded.\nBased on the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra and previously reported room temperature structural\ndata [28], the following microscopic model for the physical properties of tetragonal Sr8Fe8O23\nis proposed. The high electrical conductivity in the paramagnetic phase arises from a\ndelocalized electronic system with higher electron density at the Fe2 sites (Fe3.5+) and lower\nelectron density at the Fe1 and Fe3 sites (both formally Fe4+). Although the coordination\nnumbers are different, the two Fe4+ species cannot be resolved in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the\nparamagnetic phase. Near 70 K the Fe23.5+ sites undergo a charge ordering transition, which\nleads to electronically localized Fe3+ and Fe4+ sites and to a concomitant development of\nthree-dimensional magnetic order. Sextet F in the spectra can then be attributed to the Fe4+\n11\n\n\fsites arising from the CO. Their more localized behavior is in agreement with a more negative\nIS than that in SrFeO3 (c.f. with IS of sextet D) [39]. This view is supported by the nearly\nequal values of the total Fe3+ area fraction due to sites A, B and of the area fraction of the Fe4+\nsite F below TN. The sum of the area fractions of the two other Fe4+ sites D and E is\ncomparable to the Fe4+ fraction in the paramagnetic phase, but below TN2 they are resolved\ndue to their different Bhf. It is suggested that component E corresponds to magnetically\nordered square pyramidal Fe4+ sites in Sr8Fe8O23 which are connected only to Fe2 atoms. In\nthe course of the CO involving Fe2, the electrons at Fe1 also become more localized, which\nagain gives rise to a more negative IS than in SrFeO3. It is observed that the area fraction of\nsextet D decreases considerably between 70 and 90 K (see Fig. 9). This implies that a certain\nfraction of about 10 - 12% of D in the low temperature spectra is not due to cubic SrFeO3, but\nintrinsic to the T phase. These sites possibly originate from the nearly regular Fe(3)O6\noctahedra.\nThe arguments considered so far rely on ideal stoichiometric Sr8Fe8O23 corresponding\nto SrFeO2.875. However, from the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra it is evident that the present crystals of\nnominal composition SrFeO2.87 contain a fraction of ~ 20% Fe4+ sites arising from cubic\nSrFeO3. This implies that an additional oxygen deficiency must be accommodated in the T\nphase compared to stoichiometric Sr8Fe8O23. This is confirmed by the analysis of the 110 K\nspectrum where the C phase contribution is already magnetically ordered. The paramagnetic\nsub-spectrum that completely reflects the T phase is composed of 59% Fe3.5+ and 41% Fe4+\nsites. For stoichiometric Sr8Fe8O23 one would expect equal fractions of Fe4+ and Fe3.5+ sites.\nAccordingly there is an excess of Fe3.5+ species, in agreement with the residual fraction of\nmagnetically ordered Fe3.5+ sites in the low temperature spectra. The latter sites are obviously\nnot involved in CO and possibly are located at a crystallographically different site in the low\ntemperature crystal structure. The above area fractions in the 110 K spectrum lead to the\ncomposition SrFeO2.85 for the T phase in the present sample. There is no evidence of the\northorhombic phase in the spectra (see below). Finally it is noted that two magnetically\ndistinct Fe3+ sites are discernible, one of which (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 7) exhibits an\nunusual temperature dependence of Bhf. This behavior could also be related to disorder effects\nintroduced by additional oxygen vacancies. Clearly the chemical, structural, electronic and\nmagnetic behavior of the T phase is very complex, and more studies on crystals with\nimproved phase homogeneity are required.\n\n12\n\n\fSrFeO2.95\nThe 800 bar oxygen-annealed SrFeO2.95 crystals are also a phase mixture of C and T\nphases, but with the C phase as the majority component. This is confirmed by the M\u00f6ssbauer\nspectra shown in Fig. 10. At 100 K, for instance, the spectra show the coexistence of\nparamagnetic sites and the magnetically ordered C phase. From the area ratios, the fractions\nof C and T phases are estimated as 60% and 40%, respectively. Near 80 K the minority phase\nbegins to develop magnetic order, and the low temperature spectra reveal the various Fe sites\npresent in the charge-ordered T phase. The spectra are well described as a superposition of the\nspectra of C and T phases. These results also support our interpretation of the M\u00f6ssbauer\nspectra of the 5 kbar annealed SrFeO3, where the small minority component behaves in a\nfashion very similar to that of the T phase fraction in SrFeO2.95. The temperature evolution of\nthe present SrFeO2.95 M\u00f6ssbauer spectra is comparable to that of a ceramic sample of similar\ncomposition reported by Zhao et al. [27]. These authors attributed the paramagnetic signal\nnear 80 K to a single Fe(3+\n\n)+\n\nsite, and included a single Fe3+ line in addition to the Fe4+ sextet\n\nin their model of the 4 K spectrum. In the light of the present work, it appears likely that the\nceramic sample of Ref. [27] is also a mixture of C and T phases, and that the changes seen in\nthe spectra near 80 K correspond to the magnetic/CO transition of the T phase. However, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra in Ref. [27] is not sufficient to resolve the\ncomplex low temperature sub-spectrum of the T phase.\n\nSrFeO2.69 and SrFeO2.81\nThe O phase Sr4Fe4O11 is characterized by magnetically disordered Fe4+ sites down to\n4 K [31,41]. The latter are indeed evident in the 4 K spectrum of the present SrFeO2.69 sample\n(Fig. 11) which reveals an Fe4+ quadrupole doublet in addition to magnetic hyperfine sextets.\nThe Fe4+ ions have been associated with the square pyramidal Fe1O5 sites in the room\ntemperature crystal structure of Sr4Fe4O11 [28]. By contrast, the Fe2 sites with Fe3+ ions\nlocated in chains of vertex-sharing FeO6 octahedra undergo magnetic ordering near 230 K\n[42,33]. In the spectra at T d 200 K shown in Fig. 11, they give rise to one Fe3+ hyperfine\n\nsextet with a large quadrupole interaction parameter. At T t 250 K, only a quadrupole doublet\nwith large quadrupole splitting is observed (Table 2). The present spectra confirm that in\nSr4Fe4O11 only the Fe3+ sublattice is magnetically ordered below TN. The unusual coexistence\nof magnetically ordered and magnetically disordered sublattices at low temperature in\nSr4Fe4O11 has been attributred to magnetic frustration [41,28,33].\n\n13\n\n\fAs expected from the oxygen content, the crystals of nominal composition SrFeO2.69\nare not single phase. The spectra at 250 K and at room temperature still reveal two\nmagnetically ordered Fe3+ sites with somewhat different IS and Bhf values. They can be\nassigned to the octahedral and tetrahedral Fe3+ sites of the magnetically ordered\nbrownmillerite-type ferrite Sr2Fe2O5. Considering the 250 K spectrum, where the O phase is\ncompletely paramagnetic, one estimates that 64% of O phase and 36% of SrFeO2.50 are\npresent. The average iron oxidation state derived from the data is 3.32, leading to an overall\nsample composition of SrFeO2.66. This estimate is in reasonable agreement with the TG data.\nFinally, the presence of the O phase as minority component in SrFeO2.81 crystals\n(showing low temperature positive MR effects, see below) is confirmed by a magnetic Fe3+\nsextet with large quadrupole interaction in the 140 K and magnetically disordered Fe4+ sites in\nthe 12 K M\u00f6ssbauer spectra (Fig. 12). The essential features of the spectra are well modeled\nby a superposition of those of the T and O phases. The fraction of the O phase is most\nreasonably estimated from the 140 K spectrum. As the Fe3+ and Fe4+ sites in the O phase\noccur in the ratio 1:1, its volume fraction is given by twice the area fraction of the\nmagnetically ordered Fe3+ component and amounts to 24%. The average iron oxidation state\nis 3.67, which leads to the overall composition SrFeO2.84. Subtracting the Fe4+ fraction of the\nO phase from the total Fe4+ content, the composition of the T phase in the sample is derived as\nSrFeO2.86. Again, there is an excess of Fe3.5+ sites in comparison with stoichiometric\nSr8Fe8O23.\n\nIV.B Magnetic susceptibility and ac transport\nMagnetic susceptibility\nFig. 13 shows the magnetic susceptibility F of a set of single crystals measured at 1 T\n\nin field cooling and heating runs. The temperatures corresponding to anomalies in the F(T)\n\ncurves are summarized in Table 3. In the G\u0003= 0 sample, a maximum heralds the onset of\nhelical order at 130 K, and an additional pronounced anomaly of the susceptibility is observed\n\nat a 60 K (FC data). The latter anomaly shows a thermal hysteresis with a width of 10 K. In\nthe G = 0.05 sample the maximum at 130 K is predominant, but a pronounced shoulder is\n\nobserved around 75 K. This is followed by a decrease of the susceptibility upon further\ncooling. The latter feature is a signature of the onset of antiferromagnetic order in the\nminority tetragonal phase and also displays thermal hysteresis. In agreement with this\ninterpretation, the G\u0003= 0.15 sample exhibits a sharp maximum at 70 K with a hysteresis of ~ 3\n\n14\n\n\fK width. The weaker shoulder near 130 K is evidence of residual C phase. A noteworthy\nadditional anomaly of the susceptibility is observed at 115 K for the three compositions\ncontaining metallic C phase. This feature has no obvious counterpart in the M\u00f6ssbauer\nspectra, and its microscopic origin is presently unknown. With a further increase of the\noxygen deficit, the 70 K feature is broadened for G = 0.19 and shifted towards lower\n\ntemperature in the G\u0003= 0.23 sample. In addition, the small inflection point in the susceptibility\nnear 230 K and the slight upturn below 50 K are consistent with what is known of the\northorhombic phase [33]. The former feature reflects the antiferromagnetic ordering of the\nFe3+ sites near 230 K, whereas the latter is associated with the Fe4+ sites which remain\nmagnetically disordered. It is emphasized that the 230 K transition in SrFeO3- samples\ncorresponds to the well-known magnetic phase transition of the orthorhombic phase. It is not\na new and unexpected feature as has been claimed recently [43].\n\nMagnetoresistance\nFigures 14 and 15 summarize the magnetoresistance (MR) properties of the SrFeO3- system.\nThe temperatures corresponding to anomalies in the MR are also included in Table 3. In\nagreement with earlier work [9], the temperature dependence of the resistivity of SrFeO3.00\n(Fig. 14a) indicates that the C phase is metallic. A precipitous decrease of the resistivity by a\nfactor of two is observed at 52 K (ZF data). The transition exhibits a hysteresis with a width\nof 9 K and appears to be related to the 60 K anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility data.\nApplication of a 9 T magnetic field shifts the transition by a5 K to higher temperature. This\ninduces a large negative MR effect (Fig. 15) in a narrow temperature range around 55 K\n('T1/2 a 8 K, max. MR ~ -25%).\nSrFeO2.95 also exhibits metallic behavior with a resistivity anomaly below 70 K (Fig.\n14b), which coincides with the 70 K maximum in the susceptibility of this sample. In contrast\nto the SrFeO3.00 data, the resistivity first exhibits an upturn upon cooling below 70 K,\nfollowed by a decrease at lower temperature. Application of a 9 T magnetic field reveals that\nthe resistivity anomaly in SrFeO2.95 actually reflects two phase transitions. The shape of the\nU(T) curve can be well understood as the superposition of the properties of C and T phases for\nthis composition. This is evident by considering the magnetotransport data of SrFeO2.85,\nwhere the T phase is the majority component. As opposed to the samples dominated by the C\nphase, the oxygen-deficient SrFeO2.85 composition displays a weakly activated, semiconducting behavior upon cooling from room temperature to 70 K, where the resistivity\n\n15\n\n\fincreases by an order of magnitude (Fig. 14c)). The resistivity jump is in agreement with a\ncharge ordering transition near 70 K, as suggested by the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of SrFeO2.87. The\ntransition is characteristic of the T phase and shifted by a6 K to lower temperature in a\nmagnetic field of 9 T, in contrast to the 52 K transition in cubic SrFeO3. The field-induced\nlow temperature shift of the transition gives rise to a giant negative MR (GMR) effect of 90% that peaks sharply at ~69 K in a narrow temperature range ('T1/2a3.8K) (Fig. 15). Below\n50 K, the small down-turn of the resistivity could be assigned to percolation paths of the\nmetallic minority phase within the insulating matrix.\nReturning now to the SrFeO2.95 magnetotransport data, the small resistivity upturn near\n70 K, which is shifted to lower temperature at 9 T, can be assigned to the charge ordering\ntransition in the minority T phase. On the other hand, the overall resistivity decrease, which is\nshifted to higher temperature at 9 T, reflects the resistivity anomaly in the majority C phase.\nThese considerations are in full agreement with the M\u00f6ssbauer data on SrFeO2.95. It is\nnoteworthy that at 9 T, in contrast to the zero-field properties, the resistivity decrease in the C\nphase occurs at higher temperature than the CO transition in the T phase. As the oxygen\ndeficit is further increased, the amount of metallic phase decreases and accordingly the\npercolation paths vanish. This is exemplified for SrFeO2.81, where the weakly activated semiconducting behavior is evidenced down to 70 K, and a resistivity jump of an order of\nmagnitude occurs akin to the one of SrFeO2.85. Below 50 K, however, an additional strong upturn in U is noticed, and the sample becomes fully insulating at low temperatures. Finally, the\nresistivity of the SrFeO2.77 samples exhibits behavior closely similar to that of SrFeO2.81, but\nthe jump of the resistivity shifts slightly to lower temperature and the thermal hysteresis is\nreduced. This presumably reflects the increasing volume fraction of the orthorhombic phase.\nWe now address the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity, which exhibits a\nvariety of behaviors as a function temperature, oxygen deficit, and phase mixture.\nRepresentative data are shown in Fig. 16. The samples with the C phase as majority\ncomponent (G=0.00 and G=0.05) have a large negative MR effect in a quite narrow\ntemperature range (Fig. 15). Within this temperature range, the resistivity is weakly field\ndependent up to about 8 T, and is abruptly reduced for larger fields. Addition of a minority\namount of tetragonal phase lowers the critical field significantly to a5.5 T (Fig. 16a). For\n\nG=0.00 and G=0.05, the MR effect is remnant after a subsequent ramp-down of the field, and\n\neven when the field is reversed (data not presented here). For the samples containing\npredominantly the T phase (Fig. 15), a giant negative MR effect is observed. This effect also\n\n16\n\n\frequires fields around 8 T (Fig. 16b), but it is fully reversible upon reducing the field back to\nzero, and a symmetric curve is observed when the field is reversed. Finally, a pronounced\npositive MR effect is apparent in the low temperature insulating phases of SrFeO2.81 and\nSrFeO2.77. For these compositions, the MR effect is history dependent, e.g. the value of MR\nmeasured at a given temperature (T = 10 K) changes between isothermal field scans and\ntemperature scans. From the first method a MR effect of 52% is derived, while for the second\na positive MR as large as 256% is measured.\nThe origin of the main MR effects in the C and T phases appears to be a shift in the\nthermodynamic balance of two phases with different conductivities, which induces a shift in\nthe critical temperature separating these phases. A similar effect has been observed at the\nVerwey transition of magnetite [44]. The more complex behavior shown in Fig. 15, as well as\nthe positive MR exhibited by the insulating samples at low temperatures, probably reflect at\nleast in part the field dependence of current paths in a mixture of phases with different\nconductivities. If this is the case, a full understanding of these effects requires detailed\ninformation about the microstructure of these samples, an interesting subject of future work.\nWe now compare the present magnetotransport data on SrFeO3- single crystals with\nthe study by Zhao et al. [27] on ceramic samples. One of our crystals had the same\ncomposition, SrFeO2.95, as the one investigated by Zhao et al. Considering the similar\ncomposition and the similar M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the two materials (see above) it is likely\nthat the sample of Ref. [27] also contains a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases. The\npronounced U(T) anomaly near 50 K in Ref. [27] and the associated MR effect then reflect the\ntransition of the majority C phase, whereas the magnetic anomaly at a somewhat higher\ntemperature (65 K) and the development of paramagnetic sites in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra\ncorrespond to the magnetic/CO transition in the minority T phase. In contrast to the present\nSrFeO2.95 single crystal, the signature of the CO transition is not seen in the U(T) data of the\nceramic sample. However the detailed electronic transport paths are determined by the\nmicrostructure of the materials, which may differ in single crystals and ceramics. We\nemphasize that the pure C phase is metallic both below and above 55 K ruling out that the\nresistivity anomaly coincides with a metal \u2013 insulator transition. Accordingly the low\ntemperature upturn in the resistivity data of Ref. [27] reflects the coexistence of metallic C\nand insulating T phases rather than a metal-insulator transition in SrFeO2.95 as was claimed by\nZhao et al. [45]. In the present single crystals, large MR effects are only found in the vicinity\nof the phase transitions in the respective compositions. The low temperature MR effects in\n\n17\n\n\fceramic SrFeO2.95 possibly correspond to grain boundary effects in the polycrystalline\nmaterial. A further weak resistivity anomaly coupled with a small MR effect was established\nnear 107 K in ceramic SrFeO2.95 and associated with the magnetic ordering transition. A\nsimilar feature near 115 K is also apparent in the present data of SrFeO3.00. It is, however,\nrather related to an additional cusp near 115 K in the magnetic susceptibility (indicated by an\narrow in Fig. 13), than to the onset of helical ordering near 130 K. The relation between\nmagnetic and resistivity anomalies is clarified in Fig. 17 where we compare the derivatives\ndlnF/dT and dlnU/dT for SrFeO3.00. It is obvious that the 130 K magnetic transition does not\ngive rise to any anomaly in U(T). Fig.17 also suggests that the resistivity response related to\nthe 60 K magnetic transition occurs at somewhat lower temperature.\nThe negative GMR effect near 70 K in mainly tetragonal materials has recently been\nconfirmed for a ceramic sample of SrFeO3- with G = 0.17 [43]. This material appears to be a\nmixture of T and O phase, as can be inferred from the presence of a 230 K transition in the\nmagnetic susceptibility data. The onset of the GMR effect is already seen at 6 T, a somewhat\nlower field than in the present G = 0.15 sample. Finally, we note that a combined magnetic\nordering/CO transition giving rise to a similar resistivity jump as in SrFeO2.85 was reported\npreviously for Sr2/3Ln1/3FeO3 [46]. In this system an antiferromagnetic phase transition is\ncoupled to a charge disproportionation of Fe4+, which results in Fe3+Fe3+Fe5+ CO along the\npseudocubic [111] direction [47]. For samples with Ln = La and Pr, a weak MR effect of -2%\nat 7 T was observed near TN. Somewhat larger MR effects up to -7% were reported at low\ntemperatures [48]. However, that there is no charge disproportionation of Fe4+ in the chargeordered state of SrFeO2.85.\n\nIV.C Raman scattering and far-infrared ellipsometry\nIn the cubic perovskite SrFeO3 (space group Pm-3m) no Raman vibrational modes are\nallowed, but three IR active modes of F1u symmetry are expected. This is in agreement with\nthe experimental Raman and ellipsometric IR spectra of SrFeO3.00 depicted in Fig. 18. While\nthe Raman spectra do not show any features attributable to phonons, three IR modes with\nroom temperature frequencies 172, 249, and 559 cm-1 are observed. The temperature\nindependence of the spectra corroborates the absence of any structural phase transitions below\nroom temperature. The phonon modes are superimposed on an electronic background due to a\nDrude-like charge carrier response, which is strongly enhanced at low temperature. This\ncompares well with the increased electrical conductivity below the 55 K phase transition.\n\n18\n\n\fFurther evidence for the CO transition in the T phase is obtained from Raman and\ninfrared spectra of SrFeO2.85. Due to symmetry lowering, Raman modes become allowed for\nthe T and O phase even in the absence of CO. In agreement with this expectation, the Raman\nspectra of the G=0.15 and G=0.31 samples, shown in Fig. 19, exhibit several phonon features\nat room temperature. For SrFeO2.85 (Fig. 19, upper panel), several new vibrational modes\nappear upon cooling below 70 K, the CO temperature of the T phase already discussed in\nSections IV.A and IV.B. As expected on general grounds, this shows that the CO transition is\ncoincident with a structural transition. For the SrFeO2.69 sample (Fig. 19, bottom panel),\nwhich does not contain any T phase, no new Raman-active phonons are observed upon\ncooling to low temperatures. This is in agreement with a recent neutron diffraction study on\nSr4Fe4O11, which has shown that the orthorhombic crystal structure is retained down to 1.5 K\n[33]. This implies that the orthorhombic phase does not undergo a CO instability.\nThese conclusions are supported by far-infrared ellipsometry data on the G=0.15\nsample. It was reported already in our previous work [29] that the optical conductivity\nsuddenly drops upon cooling below ~70 K, and that additional optical modes appear in the\nsame temperature range. Figure 20 provides a synopsis of room temperature and low\ntemperature Raman scattering data in two different polarization geometries as well as farinfrared ellipsometry data on this sample. Note that comparable changes in the optical\nconductivity have been reported for the CO transition in Sr2/3La1/3FeO3 [49]. All data sets\nexhibit numerous additional phonon modes at low temperatures. Their frequencies are\nsummarized in Table 4. Since the crystal structure of the tetragonal phase that undergoes the\nCO transition has thus far not been determined, it is impossible to assign the modes. However,\nit is evident that a number of modes are observed in both Raman polarization geometries and\nin the ellipsometry data at the same frequencies. This may either reflect the low symmetry of\nthe crystal structure in the CO state, or a symmetry lowering at the boundaries of the\nconstituent T and C phases.\n\nV CONCLUDING REMARKS\nIron(IV) rich oxides reveal a variety of magnetoresistance effects. In the previously\nstudied cobalt or nickel substituted materials, the generation of MR is related to creation of\nferromagnetic clusters or regions. The largest MR effects are encountered in compositions\nwith spin-glass like magnetic behavior [22] pointing to competing ferro- and\nantiferromagnetic interactions. In this respect these materials behave in a similar fashion as\nother magnetoresistive oxides, for instance certain cobaltites [50]. In contrast, the MR effects\n19\n\n\fin single crystals of SrFeO3- which are the subject of the present work are apparently\ndifferent as they do not involve ferromagnetic ordering. We have shown that it is essential to\nconsider the phase composition of the samples in order to establish the physical properties of\nthis system. Actually three different types of MR effects are found. In cubic SrFeO3 helical\nmagnetic ordering emerges near 130 K which is, however, not associated with any anomalies\nin the electrical resistivity. In contrast a hitherto unknown magnetic transition near 60 K gives\nrise to a sharp decrease of the resistivity. The latter is shifted by a magnetic field of 9 T to\nhigher temperature which results in a large MR effect. The detailed nature of the 60 K\ntransition remains to be established, but it obviously neither involves ferromagnetic ordering\nnor charge reorganization. A coincident charge \u2013 magnetic ordering transition is the origin of\na resistivity jump by an order of magnitude in materials containing tetragonal oxygendeficient SrFeO3- \u0003\u0003(ideal composition Sr8Fe8O23) as major component. The transition is\nshifted by a 9 T field to lower temperature which results in a giant negative MR effect of\n90%. This is the largest MR effect discovered so far in an iron(IV) based oxide. The magnetic\nphase transition shows antiferromagnetic characteristics, but the detailed low-temperature\nspin and crystal structures remain to be clarified. Finally, there is a pronounced positive MR\neffect in low-temperature insulating SrFeO3- materials which may either be a property of the\npure tetragonal phase or related to the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases.\nWe believe that exploration of the different types of magnetoresistance effects in\niron(IV) based oxides is a valuable addition to our understanding of the magnetotransport\nproperties of transition metal oxides and may broaden the concepts for the design of\nmagnetoresistive materials and devices.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank S.
