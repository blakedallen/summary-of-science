We provide such tables for a popular model of\nthe evolving UV/X-ray background radiation, computed using the photo-ionization\npackage cloudy.\nKey words: atomic processes - plasmas - cooling flows - galaxies: formation -\nintergalactic medium\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDissipation of energy via radiative cooling plays a central\nrole in many different astrophysical contexts. In general\nthe cooling rate depends on a large number of parameters,\nsuch as the gas density, temperature, chemical composition, ionization balance, and the radiation field. In the\nabsence of radiation, however, the equilibrium ionization\nbalance depends only on the temperature. In that case\nthe cooling rate in the low density regime, which is dominated by collisional processes, is simply proportional to\nthe gas density squared, for a given composition. Thus,\nthe cooling rates for a plasma in collisional ionization\nequilibrium (CIE) can be conveniently tabulated as a\nfunction of the temperature and composition (metallicity) of the gas (e.g., Cox & Tucker 1969; Raymond et al.\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: wiersma@strw.leidenuniv.nl\n\n1976; Shull & van Steenberg 1982; Gaetz & Salpeter\n1983; Boehringer & Hensler 1989; Sutherland & Dopita\n1993; Landi & Landini 1999; Benjamin et al. 2001;\nGnat & Sternberg 2007; Smith et al. 2008), and such\ntables are widely used for a large variety of problems.\nAlthough it is convenient to ignore radiation when calculating cooling rates, radiation is generally important for\nthe thermal and ionization state of astrophysical plasmas.\nFor example, Efstathiou (1992) investigated the effect of the\nextragalactic UV background on the cooling rates for gas\nof primordial composition (in practice this means a pure\nH/He plasma) and found that including photo-ionization\ncan suppress the cooling rates of gas in the temperature\nrange T \u223c 104 \u2212 105 K by a large factor. Although the effects of radiation are often taken into account for gas of\nprimordial composition, photo-ionization of heavy elements\nis usually ignored in the calculation of cooling rates (but see\nLeonard 1998; Benson et al. 2002).\n\n\f2\n\nWiersma, Schaye, & Smith\n\nIn this paper we will investigate the dependence of cooling rates of gas enriched with metals on the presence of\nionizing radiation, focusing on the temperature range T \u223c\n104 \u2212 108 K and optically thin plasmas. We will show that,\nas is the case for gas of primordial composition (Efstathiou\n1992), photo-ionization can suppress the metallic cooling\nrates by a large factor. Moreover, the suppression of the\ncooling rate is significant up to much higher temperatures\nthan for the primordial case.\nWe will also investigate the relative contributions of various elements to the cooling rates. If the relative abundances\nare similar to solar, then oxygen, neon, and iron dominate\nthe cooling in the temperature range T \u223c 104 \u2212 107 K. However, we will show that the relative contributions of different\nelements to the cooling rate are sensitive to the presence of\nionizing radiation.\nAlthough we will illustrate the results using densities\nand radiation fields that are relevant for studies of galaxy\nformation and the intergalactic medium (IGM), the conclusion that photo-ionization significantly reduces the cooling\nrates of enriched gas is valid for a large variety of astrophysical problems. For example, for T \u223c 105 K and T \u223c 106 K\nthe reduction of metal-line cooling rates is significant as\n\u22123\nlong as the dimensionless ionization parameter1 U >\n\u223c 10\n\u22121\nand U >\n\u223c 10 , respectively. We will focus on the temperature range 104 \u2212 108 K because gas in this temperature\nrange is usually optically thin and because the effects of\nphoto-ionization are generally unimportant at higher temperatures.\nTables containing cooling rates and several other useful quantities as a function of density, temperature, redshift, and composition, appropriate for gas exposed to\nthe models for the evolving meta-galactic UV/X-ray background of Haardt & Madau (2001) are available on the following web site: http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/WSS08/.\nThe web site also contains a number of videos that illustrate\nthe dependence of the cooling rates on various parameters.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we\npresent our method for calculating element-by-element cooling rates including photo-ionization and we compare the\nlimiting case of CIE to results taken from the literature.\nSection 3 shows how metals and ionizing radiation affect the\ncooling rates. Section 4 demonstrates the importance for the\nlow-redshift shock-heated IGM, which is thought to contain\nmost of the baryons. In this section we also illustrate the effect of changing the intensity and spectral shape of the ionizing radiation. We investigate the effect of photo-ionization\non the relative contributions of individual elements in Section 5 and we summarize and discuss our conclusions in\nSection 6.\nThroughout this paper we use the cosmological parameters from Komatsu et al. (2008): (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b , \u03a9b , h) =\n(0.279, 0.721, 0.0462, 0.701) and a primordial helium mass\nfraction XHe = 0.248. Densities will be expressed both as\nproper hydrogen number densities nH and density contrasts\n\u03b4 \u2261 \u03c1b / h\u03c1b i \u2212 1, where h\u03c1b i is the cosmic mean baryon\ndensity. The two are related by\n\n1 U \u2261 \u03a6 /(n c), where \u03a6 is the flux of hydrogen ionizing phoH\nH\nH\ntons (i.e., photons per unit area and time), nH is the total hydrogen number density and c is the speed of light.\n\nTable 1.

We assumed the gas to\nbe dust-free, optically thin and in ionization equilibrium.\nWe discuss the limitations and the effects of the last two\nassumptions in section 6. All cooling rates are tabulated as\na function of log nH (total hydrogen number density), log T\n(temperature), and z (redshift).\nWhen studying the effect of changes in the relative\nabundances of elements, we compute the cooling rates\non an element-by-element basis. The cooling rate \u039bi (in\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22123 ) due to element i, where element i is heavier than helium, is defined as the difference between the\ncooling rate computed using all elements (assuming solar\nabundances) and the cooling rate computed after setting\nthe abundance of element i to zero, while keeping all other\nabundances (i.e., number densities relative to H) the same.\nThis is a valid approximation provided element i does not\ncontribute significantly to the free electron density, which\nis the case for all elements heavier than helium and if the\nmetallicity Z <\n\u223c Z\u2299 .\nThe combined contributions from hydrogen and helium\nare computed by interpolating in the four dimensions log nH ,\nlog T , z, and nHe /nH from tables of cloudy models that\ncontain only H and He.\nThus, the total net cooling rate,\n2\n3\n\nhttp://www.nublado.org/\nhttp://pitto.mib.infn.it/\u223chaardt/refmodel.html\n\n\fCooling of enriched, photo-ionized gas\n\u039b = \u039bH,He +\n\nX\n\n\u039bi ,\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\ni>He\n\ncould be obtained from\n\u039b = \u039bH,He +\n\nX\n\ni>He\n\nni /nH\n\u039bi,\u2299 ,\n(ni /nH )\u2299\n\n(3)\n\nwhere (ni /nH )\u2299 is the solar abundance of element i (the\ndefault cloudy solar abundances are given in Table 1) and\n\u039bi,\u2299 is the contribution of heavy element i to the radiative\ncooling rate for solar abundances, which we have tabulated\nas a function of log nH , log T , and z. Note that we use \u039b to\ndenote the cooling rate per unit volume (erg s\u22121 cm\u22123 ).\nWe can, however, do better than equation (3) by taking the dependence of the free electron density on He/H,\ninto account (in equation (3), the electron density is implicitly assumed to be that corresponding to solar abundances - nHe /nH = 0.1). Since cooling rates due to metals\nare dominated by collisions between ions and free electrons,\n\u039bi scales as the product of the free electron and ion densities,\n\u039bi \u221d ne ni . Hence,\n\u039b\n\n=\n\n\u039bH,He +\n\nX\n\n\u039bi,\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\nX\n\n\u039bi,\u2299\n\nne /nH\n10[i/H]\n(ne /nH )\u2299\n\ni>He\n\n=\n\n\u039bH,He +\n\ni>He\n\nne\nne,\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nni\nni,\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n(4)\n\nwhere 10[i/H] \u2261 (ni /nH )/(ni /nH )\u2299 and we used the fact that\nnH = nH,\u2299 (since we tabulate as a function of nH ). While\n(ne /nH )\u2299 is obtained by interpolating the solar abundance\ntable for ne /nH in (nH , T, z), (ne /nH ) must be obtained by\ninterpolating in ((nHe /nH ), nH , T, z). Note that we tabulate\nthe electron density in the absence of metals. This is a valid\napproximation given that heavy elements only contribute\nsignificantly to the free electron density for Z \u226b Z\u2299 .\nIn practice we tabulate log \u039bi,\u2299 /n2H over the range\nlog[nH (cm\u22123 )] = \u22128.0, -7.9, . . ., 0.0 and log[T (K)] = 2.00,\n2.02, . . ., 9.00. In addition, the quantities log \u039bH,He /n2H ,\nne /nH and the mean particle mass are all tabulated as a\nfunction of density and temperature for each of the values\nnHe /nH = 0.0787, 0.0830, 0.0876, 0.0922, 0.970, 0.102, 0.107\nwhich correspond to mass fractions XHe /(XH + XHe ) =\n0.238, 0.248, 0.258, 0.268, 0.278, 0.288, 0.298. Finally, for\neach value of the ratio nHe /nH we tabulate the temperature\nas a function of density and internal energy per unit mass\nto enable simulation codes that parametrize thermal energy\nin terms of the latter quantity to use the cooling tables.\nWe have computed these tables for each of the 49 redshifts\nspanning z = 0 \u2212 9 for which the HM01 models are defined.\nAll tables are in HDF5 format and together they result in\nupwards of 232 MB of storage. Reducing the resolution in\nnH and T by a factor of two does reduce the accuracy of\ninterpolated rates significantly4 , but reduces the storage requirements to 61 MB.\nWe find that for metallicities Z <\n\u223c Z\u2299 equation (4)\n\n4\n\nReducing the temperature resolution by a factor of two roughly\ndoubles the interpolation errors near the thermal equilibrium solution, but in this regime the cooling times are in any case effectively infinite.\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of normalized CIE cooling rates\nfor various studies. All curves use the solar abundances of\nGnat & Sternberg (2007), which differ somewhat from our default solar abundances. Shown are cloudy version 07.02 (solid),\nSutherland & Dopita (1993) (dashed), mappings iii (dot-dashed),\nand Gnat & Sternberg (2007) (dot-dot-dot-dashed). mappings\ngives significantly higher cooling rates for T \u223c 105 K, but the\ndifferences are typically smaller than a factor of two. Note that\nfor this comparison the cooling rates were divided by nH ne , but\nthat we divide by n2H in our tables and in figure 6. The upturn in\nthe normalized cooling rates below 104 K is caused by the sharp\ndecrease in ne with decreasing temperature.\n\nclosely matches the true cooling rate (i.e., including all elements) with very good accuracy5 if the following 11 elements\nare included: H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe.\nFor redshift z = 0 and over the full range of densities and temperatures, the median relative errors in the\nabsolute net cooling rates are 0.33%, 1.6%, and 6.1% for\nZ = 0.1Z\u2299 , Z\u2299 , and 10Z\u2299 , respectively (we have scaled\nnHe /nH with metallicity). For higher redshifts the median\nerrors are smaller than for z = 0 because Compton cooling\noff the CMB, which is modelled accurately, becomes increasingly important. Hence, even for metallicities as extreme as\n10 times solar, using equation (4) and including 11 elements\ngives errors of only a few percent. As we shall see below,\nthis is much smaller than the differences between different\nphoto-ionization codes. Using equation (3) rather than (4)\ngives similar errors for low metallicities, but the median errors are a factor 2\u20133 higher for Z > 100.5 Z\u2299 .\nExcluding temperatures within 0.1 dex of the thermal\nequilibrium solution (where the relative errors in the net\n\n5 While the error in the total cooling rates is small, the relative\nerrors in the contribution of individual elements can be larger if\nthe element contributes negligibly to the total cooling rate (see\ne.g., the noise in the Fe contour at T < 105 K in the left-hand\npanel of figure 6). This is because the tables for individual elements were computed by taking the difference between the total\ncooling rate for solar abundances including and excluding the element. Hence, if the element does not contribute significantly to\nthe cooling rate for a particular density, temperature, and redshift, then its contribution will be computed as the difference\nbetween two nearly equal numbers. Because this can only occur\nif the contribution is negligible, we do not consider this to be a\nproblem.\n\n\f4\n\nWiersma, Schaye, & Smith\n\ncooling rate, which is computed as the absolute difference\nbetween heating and cooling, become large because we are\nsubtracting two nearly identical numbers), the maximum\nerrors in the net cooling rates are 32%, 29%, and 39% for\nZ = 0.1Z\u2299 , Z\u2299 , and 10Z\u2299 , respectively. Thus, even for extreme metallicities the maximum difference between the estimated and true rates is well within a factor of two. These\nmaxima are reached near the 0.1 dex exclusion zone, so the\nmaximum errors for temperatures that differ substantially\nfrom the equilibrium values are much smaller.\nWe have also tabulated the combined cooling rates of all\nelements heavier than helium, assuming solar relative abundances. While scaling all heavy elements simultaneously reduces the accuracy (relative to scaling the contribution of\neach element individually), these tables may be convenient\nin the absence of a complete set of elemental abundances.\nIn this case, the total cooling rate becomes:\n\u039b = \u039bH,He + \u039bZ,\u2299\n\nne /nH Z\n.\n(ne /nH )\u2299 Z\u2299\n\n(5)\n\nAlthough cooling rates including photo-ionization have\nnot yet been tabulated, CIE cooling rates have been published by various authors. In Figure 1 we compare our\nCIE results (i.e., cloudy version 07.02) with those of\nGnat & Sternberg (2007) (who used cloudy version 06.02),\nSutherland & Dopita (1993) (who used mappings) and also\nwith mappings iii (version r; Groves et al. 2008). The calculations generally differ in terms of the code, the atomic\nrates, and the solar abundances that were used. In order to\nfocus the comparison on codes and rates, we used the solar abundances assumed by Gnat & Sternberg (2007) when\ncomputing the cooling rates for all curves in this figure6 .\nNote that these abundances differ somewhat from the solar\nabundances that we use in the rest of this paper.\nThe differences in the cooling rates shown in Figure 1\nare typically smaller than 0.3 dex suggesting that the cooling rates are known to better than a factor of two, at least\nfor CIE. The differences are largest for T \u223c 105 K, with\nmappings giving higher cooling rates than cloudy.\n\n3\n\nPHOTO-IONIZATION, METALS, AND\nCOOLING RATES\n\nThe cooling rates in photo-ionization equilibrium are not\nproportional to the density squared, as is the case for CIE.\nAs a consequence, the cooling curve changes dramatically\nwith density. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows normalized, net cooling, rates (|\u039b/n2H |), as a function of temperature for solar abundances. Different curves correspond\nto different densities, as indicated in the legend.\nThe calculation includes the CMB and the HM01 background at redshift three. The z = 3 HM01 background\ncorresponds to a hydrogen photo-ionization rate \u039312 \u2261\n\u0393/10\u221212 s\u22121 = 1.1 and an ionization parameter U =\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 /nH . We stress that in the vicinity of ionizing\nsources the radiation field may be much more intense, which\n\n6\n\nSutherland & Dopita (1993) only give the cooling rates as a\nfunction of the abundance of iron, which we interpolated to the\ncorresponding Gnat & Sternberg (2007) value.\n\nFigure 2. Normalized, absolute, net cooling rates (|\u039b/n2H |) as\na function of temperature for solar abundances. Different curves\ncorrespond to different gas densities, as indicated in the legend.\nThe gas in all models is exposed to the z = 3 CMB and the z = 3\nHM01 UV/X-ray background. Note that the cooling rates were\ndivided by n2H , but that we divided by nH ne in Fig. 1.\n\nwould enhance its effect on the cooling rates compared to\nthe results presented here.\nAs the density decreases the gas becomes more highly\nionized and the cooling peaks due to collisional excitation of\nvarious ions disappear. For very low densities and high temperatures the normalized cooling rates actually increase as\nthey become dominated by Compton cooling off the CMB,\nwhich scales as \u039b \u221d ne T . For the two lowest densities shown,\nthe equilibrium temperature, for which the net cooling rate\n\u039b \u2192 0, exceeds 104 K. In these cases, curves corresponding\nto net heating appear to the left of the thermal equilibrium\ntemperature.\nFigure 3 shows how the presence of heavy elements\nand radiation affects the radiative cooling time. Each panel\nshows contours of constant cooling time in the densitytemperature plane for two models. The top panels illustrate\nwell known results, while the bottom panels demonstrate the\nimportance of radiation on the cooling due to metal lines.\nHere and throughout the cooling time refers to the absolute value of the net radiative cooling time at a fixed hydrogen density,\ntcool \u2261\n\n3\nnkT\nT\n2\n=\n.\ndT /dt\n|\u039bheat \u2212 \u039bcool |\n\n(6)\n\nFor temperatures below the thermal equilibrium temperature, tcool corresponds to a heating timescale. The calculation includes the CMB and, optionally, the HM01 background at redshift three.\nNote that adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the\nUniverse is not included, but would dominate over radiative\ncooling for sufficiently low densities. For example, the universal Hubble expansion (appropriate for densities around\nthe cosmic mean, i.e., nH \u223c 10\u22125 cm\u22123 at z = 3) corresponds to an adiabatic cooling time tcool,adiab = 1/(2H) \u2248\n1.6 \u00d7 109 yr at z = 3.\nThe top-left panel shows that for a metal-free7 gas,\n7\n\nWe use nHe /nH = 0.083 for primordial abundances.\n\n\fCooling of enriched, photo-ionized gas\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Contour plots of the net cooling time in years as a function of temperature and total hydrogen number density (note that\nthe mean baryon density corresponds to nH \u223c 10\u22125 cm\u22123 at z = 3). For temperatures below the equilibrium temperature, the contours\nindicate negative net cooling times, that is, heating times (see text). The gas in all models is exposed to the z = 3 CMB. In addition,\nmodels for which the legend indicates \u039312 = 1.1 use the z = 3 HM01 UV/X-ray background. The figure confirms that both metals and\nphoto-ionization affect the cooling rates significantly, and shows their combined effect. Top-left: The effect of photo-ionization for zero\nmetallicity; Top-right: The effect of metallicity for a purely collisionally ionized plasma; Bottom-left: The effect of photo-ionization for\nsolar metallicity; Bottom-right: The effect of metallicity for a photo-ionized plasma.\n\nionizing radiation drastically reduces the cooling rates for\n5\n104 K < T <\n\u223c 10 K (Efstathiou 1992). This happens because\nthe peaks in the cooling rate due to collisional excitation\nof neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium (followed by\nLy\u03b1 emission) are removed when the gas is photo-ionized.\nIn the presence of ionizing radiation (solid curves) there\nare actually two contours for each net cooling time, corresponding to net heating (left of the thermal equilibrium\nasymptote) and net cooling (right of the equilibrium asymptote). These two contours nearly merge8 near the (densitydependent) thermal equilibrium temperature, slightly above\n104 K, where the net cooling time goes to infinity. Below\nthis temperature, the heating time is dictated by the photoheating rate.\nFor T \u226b 105 K photo-ionization has no effect on a\nmetal-free gas because the plasma is already fully ionized\nby collisional processes. In this regime the plasma cools pre-\n\n8\n\nThe fact that the contours really do merge and then disappear\nat high densities is due to the limitations of our plotting package\nand the finite resolution of our grid.\n\ndominantly via the emission of Bremsstrahlung and/or inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons. The latter process is the dominant cooling mechanism for most of the\nbaryons at high redshift (z > 7). In the plot inverse Compton cooling off the CMB dominates the radiative cooling\nrate at low densities and high temperatures, but the corresponding cooling time exceeds the Hubble time.\nFor diffuse, intergalactic gas (i.e., for density contrasts\n\u03b4 \u226a 102 , corresponding to nH \u226a 10\u22123 cm\u22123 at z =\n3, much lower than expected in virialized objects, e.g.,\nColes & Lucchin 2002) of primordial composition, radiation\nincreases the cooling time at 105 K by at least an order of\nmagnitude and by much more at lower temperatures. Since\nthe cooling times in this regime are comparable to the Hubble time, radiation will have a large effect on the fraction\nof the baryons that are hot. At densities corresponding to\n2\n\u22123\n> \u22123\ncollapsed objects (\u03b4 >\n\u223c 10 or nH \u223c 10 cm at z = 3), the\nincrease in the cooling time is generally smaller, although it\ncan still easily be an order of magnitude at temperatures as\nhigh as 104.5 K.\nThe top-right panel shows that heavy elements strongly\nincrease the cooling rate of a collisionally ionized plasma\n\n\f6\n\nWiersma, Schaye, & Smith\n\n7\nfor 104 K \u226a T <\n\u223c 10 K (e.g., Boehringer & Hensler 1989).\nComparing the model with primordial abundances (dashed\ncontours) to the one assuming solar metallicity (solid contours), we see that the cooling times typically differ by about\nan order of magnitude. The presence of metals allows radiative cooling through collisional excitation of a large number\nof ions at a variety of temperatures. For T > 107 K the difference is smaller because there are few lines to excite since\nmost elements are collisionally ionized to a very high degree.\nBremsstrahlung is the dominant cooling mechanism at these\nvery high temperatures.\nThe bottom-left panel demonstrates that ionizing radiation also strongly reduces the cooling rates when heavy\nelements dominate the cooling. This happens for the same\nreason as in the primordial case. The radiation field ionizes the plasma to a higher degree than it would be in CIE.\nHence, the ions that are typically collisionally excited are\nnot present, reducing the cooling rates.\nNote that a similar thing happens when a collisionally ionized plasma is cooling more quickly than\nit can recombine. In that case the ionization balance\nshifts out of equilibrium leaving the gas too highly ionized for its temperature. As for photo-ionization, the\nassociated reduction of the number of bound electrons\nwith excitation energies low enough to be collisionally\nexcited, reduces the cooling rate (e.g., Kafatos 1973;\nShapiro & Moore 1976; Schmutzler & Tscharnuter 1993;\nSutherland & Dopita 1993).\nComparing the models with (solid contours) and without ionizing radiation (dashed contours), we see that for densities characteristic of the diffuse IGM (\u03b4 \u226a 102 corresponding to nH \u226a 10\u22123 cm\u22123 at z = 3), radiation significantly re6\nduces the cooling rates for T <\n\u223c 10 K and that the reduction\n5\ntypically exceeds one order of magnitude for T <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 K.\n\u22123\n\u22123\nFor densities nH >\n\u223c 10 cm the cooling rates are only suppressed substantially for T < 3 \u00d7 104 K. However, we stress\nthat what matters here is the ionization parameter. Hence,\na stronger radiation field will affect the cooling rates up to\nhigher densities. Gas with a density characteristic of collapsed objects will typically be close to sources of ionizing\nradiation and may thus be exposed to a radiation field that\nis more intense than the meta-galactic UV background.\nFinally, the bottom-right panel shows that metals\nstrongly increase the cooling rates in the presence of an ionizing radiation field, as was the case for a collisionally ionized\ngas (top-right panel). For solar metallicity the cooling rate\nat T < 107 K is typically an order of magnitude higher than\nfor a primordial composition.\n\u22125\n\u22123\nNote that for very low densities (nH <\n\u223c 10 cm ) metals increase the equilibrium temperature (towards the left\nside of the region where the net cooling time is above 1010\nyears) because their presence boosts the photo-heating (via\noxygen and iron9 ) but does not significantly affect the cooling because it is dominated by Compton cooling off the\nCMB.\n\n9\n\nThe increased He/H ratio also boosts the photo-heating rate,\nbut its contribution is smaller than that of the metals.\n\nFigure 4. Contours show where the net cooling time equals\nthe Hubble time in the density contrast - temperature plane at\nz = 0. From top to bottom, the different colours correspond to\nprimordial composition (blue), a metallicity of ten percent solar (red), and solar abundances (black). Dashed contours are for\ncollisional ionization only, while solid contours are for gas exposed to the HM01 model for the z = 0 UV/X-ray background.\nEach solid contour comprises two components, corresponding\nto net heating (low temperature component) and net cooling\n(high temperature component), respectively, which merge near\nthe (density-dependent) thermal equilibrium temperature. Both\nphoto-ionization and metallicity determine whether gas is able to\ncool and it is therefore crucial to take both into account when\npredicting the fraction of the baryons that reside in the WHIM.\n\n4\n\nEFFECT ON THE WHIM\n\nThe fraction of gas that has been shock-heated to tem7\nperatures of 105 K <\n\u223c T < 10 K is currently of great interest, mainly because this so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) is hard to detect, yet may contain a\nlarge fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe\n(e.g., Cen & Ostriker 1999). There are two reasons why the\nWHIM becomes more important at lower redshift. First, as\nstructure formation progresses, larger structures form, leading to stronger gravitational accretion shocks and a greater\nfraction of the baryons are heated to temperatures in the\nWHIM range. Second, as the universe expands, the density\nof the diffuse gas decreases as10 (1 + z)3 and the cooling\ntime due to collisional processes (which dominate for z < 7)\nwill thus increase as (1 + z)\u22123 . Hence, the cooling time increases faster than the Hubble time and more and more of\nthe shock-heated gas is unable to cool.\nSince the cooling times are of order the Hubble time for\nmuch of the WHIM, the precise values of the cooling rate\nis particularly important. Because the cooling of the WHIM\ntends to be dominated by line radiation, because its density\nis low (\u03b4 \u223c 10 \u2212 102 ; e.g., Bertone et al. 2008), and because\nthe WHIM gas may well be enriched to values of 10% of\nsolar or higher, both metals and photo-ionization by the\nUV background may be important. Figure 4 demonstrates\nthat this is indeed the case.\nFigure 4 shows a contour plot of the cooling time in the\n10\n\nIn reality the density will decrease slightly less fast with time\nif the gas is overdense and collapsing.\n\n\fCooling of enriched, photo-ionized gas\n\n7\n\ndensity contrast-temperature plane for redshift z = 0. Each\ncontour corresponds to the same net cooling time, namely\nthe Hubble time. Dashed contours are for a purely collisionally ionized gas, while the solid contours include photoionization by the z = 0 UV/X-ray background radiation\nfrom galaxies and quasars, which corresponds to a hydrogen photo-ionization rate \u039312 = 0.08 and an ionization parameter U = 9 \u00d7 10\u22127 /nH . Metallicity increases from the\ntop down from zero (i.e., primordial abundances) (blue contours), to 10% solar (red) to solar (black), as indicated in\nthe figure. Gas above a given contour is able to cool, while\ngas below it will remain hot.\nFor a primordial composition (blue contours), turning\non the ionizing radiation raises the density contrast above\n2\n5\nwhich the gas can cool from \u03b4 <\n\u223c 10 to \u03b4 \u223c 10 for T < 10 K.\nFor solar metallicity, the UV radiation becomes important\nfor T < 106 K and raises the critical density required for\ncooling within a Hubble time by about an order of magni5\ntude for T <\n\u223c 10 K. Increasing the metallicity from zero to\nsolar decreases the critical density contrast by about an order of magnitude over the full range of WHIM temperatures.\nClearly, both photo-ionization and metals are important for\nthe thermal evolution of the WHIM.\nFigure 5 shows how the intensity and the spectral shape\nof the ionizing radiation affect the results for solar abundances. The solid contour indicates the density contrasts and\ntemperatures for which the cooling time equals the Hubble\ntime for the z = 0 HM01 model for the UV/X-ray radiation\nfrom quasars and galaxies (model QG). It is identical to the\nblack, solid contour in Figure 4. The dashed contour shows\nthe tcool = tH contour after we have multiplied the entire\nHM01 radiation field by a factor of 10 (model 10\u2217QG). Increasing the intensity reduces the cooling rates, shifting the\ncontour to higher densities.\nThe dot-dashed contour corresponds to the quasar only\nHM01 model (model Q), which we have rescaled such as to\ngive the same hydrogen ionization rate as model QG. Since\nthe average energy of H-ionizing photons is higher for model\nQ than for QG, the difference between the dot-dashed and\nsolid contours reflects the effect of changing the spectral\nhardness. Comparing these two contours, we see that, at a\nfixed H ionization rate, harder spectra tend to inhibit the\ncooling more than softer spectra for temperatures above the\nequilibrium value (the tcool = tH contour moves to higher\ndensities for harder spectra). This happens because collisional excitation of heavy ions involves electrons with higher\nionization energies than hydrogen. The extra high energy\nphotons will remove many of those electrons, thus reducing the cooling rates further. For temperatures below the\nequilibrium value, however, the net cooling time actually\ndecreases (the lower-left of the left contour moves to lower\ndensities for harder spectra) because the photo-heating rates\nare larger for harder spectra.\nIn summary, for densities and temperatures characteristic of the WHIM the nature of the ionizing radiation field\nas well as the metallicity of the gas may have a significant\nimpact. Accurate cooling rates therefore require a correct\ntreatment of the composition of the gas, the spectral hardness, and the radiation intensity. Simple models may result\nin a poor estimate of the amount of baryons in the WHIM\nphase.\n\nFigure 5. Contours show where the net cooling time equals the\nHubble time in the density contrast - temperature plane for gas\nof solar metallicity at z = 0. The solid contour is for the HM01\nmodel for the z = 0 UV/X-ray background from galaxies and\nquasars (model QG), the dashed contour is for a radiation field\nwith the same spectral shape as model QG, but 10 times the intensity, and the dot-dashed contour is for the HM01 quasars only\nradiation field, scaled to the same hydrogen ionization rate as\nmodel QG. Each contour comprises two components, corresponding to net heating (low temperature component) and net cooling\n(high temperature component), respectively, which merge near\nthe (density-dependent) thermal equilibrium temperature.\n\n5\n\nTHE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF\nDIFFERENT ELEMENTS\n\nFor solar abundances, a large number of elements contribute\nto the radiative cooling rate. The black, solid curve in the\nleft-hand panel of Figure 6 shows the normalized cooling\nrate (\u039b/n2H ) as a function of temperature for a plasma\nin pure CIE and for solar abundances, reproducing previous work done on this subject (e.g., Cox & Tucker\n1969;\nRaymond et al.\n1976;\nShull & van Steenberg\n1982; Gaetz & Salpeter 1983; Boehringer & Hensler\n1989; Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Landi & Landini 1999;\nBenjamin et al. 2001; Gnat & Sternberg 2007; Smith et al.\n2008). The thin, coloured, solid curves show the contributions from individual elements, while the black, dashed\ncurve shows the total cooling rate due to H and He. For\nT \u226b 107 K Bremsstrahlung (i.e., H & He) dominates, but at\nlower temperatures line radiation is most important. Going\ndown from 107 K to 104 K the cooling rate is successively\ndominated by iron, neon, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.\nIf the cooling rate is dominated by a single element, as is\nfor example the case for oxygen at T \u2248 2\u00d7105 K and for iron\nat T \u223c 106 K, then the total cooling rate will be sensitive\nto the relative abundances of those elements. For instance,\nsince [O/Fe] is observed to vary with environment by factors\nof two or so at a fixed metallicity (e.g., Shetrone et al. 2003),\nwe can expect similar variations in the cooling rates.\nWe next turn on the HM01 ionizing background and\nillustrate the results for nH = 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and z = 3 in the\nright-hand panel of Figure 6 (recall that the left-hand panel\nis independent of both density and redshift). For this figure\nwe have excluded Compton cooling off the CMB to isolate\nthe impact of the ionizing radiation and because the former\n\n\f8\n\nWiersma, Schaye, & Smith\n\nFigure 6. Normalized cooling rates as a function of temperature for solar abundances, assuming either CIE (left-hand panel ) or photoionization equilibrium for nH = 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and an optically thin gas exposed to the z = 3 HM01 model for the meta-galactic UV/X-ray\nbackground from quasars and galaxies (right-hand panel ). Note that normalized cooling rates are independent of the density for CIE,\nbut not for photo-ionization equilibrium. The black, solid curve indicates the total cooling rate and the thin, coloured, solid curves show\nthe contributions from individual elements. The black, dashed curve shows the contribution from H and He.\n\nis only important at high redshift. We can see that photoionization affects some elements more than others. As we\nhave seen before, the effect is stronger for lower temperatures. Although we show the results for only a single density here, we note that the importance of photo-ionization\nincreases with decreasing density.\nComparing the cooling rates including photo-ionization\n(right-hand panel of figure 6) to those for CIE (left-hand\npanel of figure 6) shows that photo-ionization increases the\nrelative importance of oxygen and decreases that of carbon,\nhelium, and especially hydrogen. It is also clear that many\nof the peaks of the various elements shift to lower temperatures when an ionizing radiation field is present. This shift\noccurs because a photo-ionized gas is overionized for its temperature compared to a collisionally ionized plasma. If the\nion fractions peak at lower temperatures, then so will the\ncooling rates due to collisional excitation of those ions.\nThis last figure illustrates the central result of this work:\nphoto-ionization changes both the total cooling rates and\nthe relative importance of individual elements. For a more\ncomplete visualization of this point, we kindly refer the interested reader to our web site11 , where we host a number\nof videos, plots, and the tables themselves for download.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nRadiative cooling is an essential ingredient of hydrodynamical models of a wide range of astrophysical objects, ranging from the IGM to (proto-)galaxies and molecular clouds.\nWhile numerical simulations of objects with a primordial\ncomposition often compute non-equilibrium radiative cooling rates explicitly and sometimes even include the effect\nof ionizing background radiation, the treatment of cooling\nof chemically enriched material is typically much more approximate. For example, simulations of galaxy formation\n\n11\n\nhttp://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/WSS08/.\n\ntypically either ignore metal-line cooling altogether or include it assuming pure CIE. In addition, the abundances of\nall heavy elements are typically scaled by the same factor\n(the metallicity) (but see Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Serrano et al. 2008 and\nMaio et al. 2007 for recent exceptions). In this simplified\ntreatment metal-line cooling depends only on temperature\nand metallicity, allowing straightforward interpolation from\npre-computed two-dimensional tables.\nWe have used cloudy to investigate the effects of heavy\nelements and ionizing radiation on the radiative cooling of\ngas with properties characteristic of (proto-)galaxies and the\n\u22123\nIGM, i.e., optically thin gas with densities nH <\n\u223c 1 cm and\n4\ntemperatures T >\n\u223c 10 K, assuming ionization equilibrium.\nWe presented a method to incorporate radiative cooling on\nan element-by-element basis including photo-ionization by\nan evolving UV/X-ray background, using precomputed tables, which for heavy elements are functions of density, temperature, and redshift and for H&He (which must be considered together because they are important contributors to\nthe free electron density) depend additionally on the He/H\nratio. Using the 11 elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S,\nCa, and Fe, the redshift z = 0 median absolute errors in the\nnet cooling rate range from 0.33%, at Z = 0.1Z\u2299 to 6.1%\nfor the extreme metallicity Z = 10Z\u2299 , and the errors are\nsmaller for higher redshifts.\nThe tables as well as some scripts that illustrate how\nto use them are available from the following web site:\nhttp://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/WSS08/. We also include\ntables for solar relative abundances which can be used if\nmetallicity, but not the abundances of individual elements\nare known, as in equation (5). This web site also contains a\nnumber of videos that may be helpful to gain intuition on\nthe importance of various parameters on the cooling rates.\nWe confirmed that, assuming CIE, heavy elements greatly enhance the cooling rates for metallicities\n\u22121\n< 7\nZ>\n\u223c 10 Z\u2299 and temperatures T \u223c 10 K. We demonstrated\nthat this remains true in the presence of photo-ionization by\nthe meta-galactic UV/X-ray background.\nThe background radiation removes electrons that would\n\n\fCooling of enriched, photo-ionized gas\notherwise be collisionally excited, thus reducing the cooling\nrates. The effect is stronger for higher ionization parameters\n(i.e., higher radiation intensities or lower densities) and if the\nspectral shape of the radiation field is harder. Considering\nonly the meta-galactic radiation field, which provides a lower\nlimit to the intensity of the radiation to which optically thin\ngas may be exposed, the reduction of the metal-line cooling\nrates becomes important below 106 K for ionization param\u22121\n5\n> \u22123\neters U >\n\u223c 10 and below 10 K for U \u223c 10 (note that for\n\u22127\nthe HM01 background U = 9 \u00d7 10 /nH and 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 /nH\nat z = 0 and z = 3, respectively).\nAs an example of the potential importance of including the effects of both photo-ionization and heavy elements,\nwe considered the so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium\n(WHIM), which is thought to contain a large fraction of\nthe baryons at redshifts z < 1. We demonstrated that the\noverdensities for which gas at typical WHIM metallicities\n(Z \u223c 10\u22121 Z\u2299 ) and temperatures (T \u223c 105 \u2212 107 K) can\ncool within a Hubble time, can shift by an order of magnitude depending on whether photo-ionization and metal-line\ncooling are taken into account. Hence, photo-ionization of\nheavy elements may have important consequences for predictions of the amount of matter contained in this elusive\ngas phase.\nBecause chemical enrichment happens in a number\nof stages, involving a number of processes with different\ntimescales, the relative abundances of the heavy elements\nvaries with redshift and environment by factors of a few.\nHence, computing cooling rates on an element-by-element\nbasis rather than scaling all elements by the metallicity, will\nchange the cooling rates by factors of a few. The difference\nis therefore typically somewhat smaller than the effect of\nneglecting metals or photo-ionization altogether, but still\nhighly significant.\nWhile it was known that different elements dominate\nthe cooling for different temperatures in CIE, we showed\nthat photo-ionization both shifts the peaks due to individual elements to smaller temperatures and reduces their amplitude. Note that since photo-ionization over-ionizes the\ngas, this effect is similar (but not equivalent to) that found\nin non-equilibrium calculations without ionizing radiation\n(e.g., Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Gnat & Sternberg 2007).\nBecause the importance of photo-ionization depends on the\nionization parameter, the relative contributions of individual\nelements exposed to a fixed ionizing radiation field depends\nalso on the gas density.\nWould dropping our assumption of ionization equilibrium have a large effect on the cooling rates? Ionizing radiation results in a plasma that is overionized relative to\nits temperature. Its effect is therefore similar to that of\nnon-equilibrium ionization following rapid cooling (i.e., if\nthe cooling time is shorter than the recombination times\nof the ions dominating the cooling, see e.g., Kafatos 1973;\nShapiro & Moore 1976). We therefore anticipate that the effect of non-equilibrium ionization will be much smaller for\nour cooling rates than for those that assume CIE.\nThe assumptions that the gas is optically thin and exposed only to the meta-galactic background radiation are\nlikely to be more important than the assumption of ionization equilibrium, particularly since non-equilibrium collisional cooling rates only differ from those assuming CIE\nby factors of a few or less (e.g., Schmutzler & Tscharnuter\n\n9\n\n1993; Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Gnat & Sternberg 2007).\nFor column densities NHI > 1017 cm\u22122 self-shielding becomes important and only part of the H-ionizing radiation\nwill penetrate the gas cloud, which would particularly af5\nfect the cooling rates for T <\n\u223c 10 K. At higher temperatures\nline cooling is dominated by heavier ions, which can only\nbe ionized by higher energy photons and which therefore\nremain optically thin up to much higher column densities.\nThis is because the photo-ionization cross sections of H and\nHe drop rapidly with increasing frequency for energies exceeding their ionization potentials. Moreover, for T \u226b 104 K\nhydrogen is collisionally ionized to a high degree and consequently the optical depth for ionizing radiation will be\nsignificantly reduced.\nIt is, however, far from clear that high column densities would reduce the effect of radiation. For self-shielded\nclouds the cooling radiation may itself be trapped, providing\na source of ionizing radiation even in the absence of an external one (e.g., Shapiro & Moore 1976; Gnat & Sternberg\n2007). Moreover, gas clouds with columns that exceed\n1017 cm\u22122 are on average expected to be sufficiently close\nto a galaxy that local sources of ionizing radiation dominate\nover the background (Schaye 2006; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2005).\nUltimately, these issues can only be resolved if nonequilibrium cooling rates are computed including radiative\ntransfer and if the locations of all relevant sources of ionizing\nradiation are known. It will be some time before it is feasible to carry out such a calculation in, say, a cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation. In the mean time, we believe\nthat our element-by-element calculation of the equilibrium\ncooling rates for an optically thin gas exposed to the CMB\nand an evolving UV/X-ray background provides a marked\nimprovement over earlier treatments. In future publications\nwe will present cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations\nusing these cooling rates.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee whose helpful comments greatly improved the manuscript.
