KOZLOV\nAbstract. The main result of this paper is a proof of the following conjecture\nof Babson & Kozlov:\nTheorem. Let G be a graph of maximal valency d, then the complex Hom (G, Kn ) is at least (n \u2212 d \u2212 2)-connected.\nHere Hom (\u2212, \u2212) denotes the polyhedral complex introduced by Lov\u00e1sz to study\nthe topological lower bounds for chromatic numbers of graphs.\nWe will also prove, as a corollary to the main theorem, that the complex\nHom (C2r+1 , Kn ) is (n \u2212 4)-connected, for n \u2265 3.\n\n1. Introduction.\nGiven a graph G and a positive integer n, there is a construction of a topological\nspace, which can be thought of as a space of all n-colorings of G. This space,\ndenoted Hom (G, Kn ), is a polyhedral complex, whose set of vertices coincides with\nthe set of all allowed vertex colorings of G that use at most n colors.\nIf n < \u03c7(G), then this space is empty, otherwise, it possesses a meaningful topology. Intuitively, the cells of Hom (G, Kn ) of positive dimension encode \"homotopies\nof colorings\", i.e., in some sense, continuous procedures of changing one allowed\ncoloring into another one. The general definition is given in subsection 2.2.\nHom (\u2212, \u2212)-complexes were introduced by Lov\u00e1sz, [10], to study topological lower\nbounds for chromatic numbers of graphs. The special case Hom (K2 , G) is the motivating example, since it turns out to be homotopy equivalent to the previously\nwell-studied neighborhood complex N(G). Recall that neighborhood complexes are\nthe ones which were so spectacularly used by Lov\u00e1sz to resolve the Kneser Conjecture, see [8, 9].\nMeanwhile, the other Hom (\u2212, \u2212)-complexes are not as well-understood. The\nfamily of complexes Hom (C2r+1 , G) constitute one instance that has been studied\nlately, in connection with the proof by Babson & Kozlov of the Lov\u00e1sz Conjecture,\n[1, 2, 3].\nIt has also been recently proven by the authors, see [6], that for two arbitrary\ncycles Cm and Cn , the connected components of the complex Hom (Cm , Cn ) are\neither points, or are homotopy equivalent to circles.\nDate: September 22, 2004.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. primary 05C15, secondary 57M15.\nKey words and phrases.

KOZLOV\n\nThe intuition tells us that, if the maximal valency of the graph G is small and the\nnumber n is relatively large, then there should be a lot of freedom in completing the\nn-colorings of G locally. Expressed topologically, we may hope that the complexes\nHom (G, Kn ) will be highly connected.\nTo say that Hom (G, Kn ) is (\u22121)-connected is the same as to say that it is\nnonempty. It is well-known that a sufficient condition is provided by requiring\nthat the maximal valency of G is at most n \u2212 1 (the most primitive coloring procedure works). Next, it was shown in [2, Proposition 2.4] that, if the maximal valency\nof G is at most n \u2212 2, then Hom (G, Kn ) is connected (= 0-connected).\nMotivated by these special cases and by some further computational evidence,\nBabson & Kozlov made the conjecture which initiated our present study.\nConjecture 1.1. [2, Conjecture 2.5].\nThe following inequality is valid for an arbitrary graph G:\n(1.1)\n\nconn Hom (G, Kn ) \u2265 n \u2212 maxval(G) \u2212 2.\n\nIn other words: for an arbitrary graph G, if maxval(G) < n \u2212 k, then Hom (G, Kn )\nis (k \u2212 1)-connected.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to present a proof of this conjecture. First,\nwe analyze the situation for n \u2265 maxval(G) + 3. In this case, we find an explicit\nalgorithm for deforming an arbitrary loop inside Hom (G, Kn ) to a point, thereby\nverifying the triviality of the fundamental group.\nNot surprisingly, it is virtually impossible to generalize these explicit homotopies\nto higher dimensions. Instead, we choose to use Hurewicz theorem, and calculate\nthe nullity of the appropriate homology groups instead. Again, we give an explicit\nalgorithmic procedure for reducing an arbitrary cycle to zero, by means of adding\nto it appropriately chosen boundaries.\nAcknowledgments. The first author would like to thank Rade \u017divaljevi\u0107 for\ninvaluable discussions and constant encouragement.\n2. Basic notations and definitions.\n2.1. Notations and terminology.\nFor an arbitrary natural number n we introduce a shorthand notation: [n] =\n{1, 2, . . . , n}.\nFor any graph G, we denote the set of its vertices by V (G), and the set of its\nedges by E(G), where E(G) \u2286 V (G) \u00d7 V (G). In this paper we will consider only\nundirected graphs, so (x, y) \u2208 E(G) implies that (y, x) \u2208 E(G). Also, our graphs\nare finite and do not contain loops.\nLet G be a graph and S \u2286 V (G). Then we denote by G[S] the graph with\nV (G[S]) = S and E(G[S]) = (S \u00d7 S) \u2229 E(G). The graph G[V (G) \\ S] we will\ndenote by G \u2212 S.\nFor a graph G and v \u2208 V (G), let N(v) = {w \u2208 V (G) | (v, w) \u2208 E(G)}, N(v) is\nthe set of neighbors of v. Denote the valency of v by d(v), clearly d(v) = |N(v)|.\nAlso denote the maximal valency of G, max{d(v) | v \u2208 V (G)}, by maxval(G).\nFor a graph G and a natural number n, let vgap(G, n) denote what we call the\nn-color-valency gap, namely, set vgap(G, n) := n \u2212 maxval(G) \u2212 1. With these\nnotations, the equation (1.1) can be rewritten as:\nconn Hom (G, Kn ) \u2265 vgap(G, n) \u2212 1.\n\n\fHIGHER CONNECTIVITY OF GRAPH COLORING COMPLEXES\n\n3\n\nIn other words, the first possibly nontrivial homotopy group of Hom (G, Kn ) is indexed by the n-color-valency gap, vgap(G, n).\nDenote with Kn , and Cn the complete graph (no loops), resp. the cycle with n\nvertices, i.e., V (Kn ) = V (Cn ) = [n], and E(Kn ) = {(x, y) | x, y \u2208 [n], x 6= y},\nE(Cn ) = {(x, x +n 1), (x +n 1, x) | x \u2208 [n]}. The maximal valency of Cn is 2, for\nn \u2265 3, while the maximal valency of Kn is`n \u2212 1.\nFor any two graphs G and H, let G H denote the disjoint union of these\ngraphs.\n2.2. Hom complexes: definition, examples and basic properties.\nA standard generalization of graph colorings is provided by the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1. For two graphs G and H, a graph homomorphism from G to H\nis a map \u03c6 : V (G) \u2192 V (H) such that if (x, y) \u2208 E(G), then (\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)) \u2208 E(H).\nWe denote the set of all homomorphisms from G to H by Hom 0 (G, H).\nDefinition 2.2. [10],[1, Definition 1.2]\nHom (G, H) is a polyhedral complex whose cells are indexed by all functions \u03b7 :\nV (G) \u2192 2V (H) \\ {\u2205}, such that if (x, y) \u2208 E(G), then for all x\u0303 \u2208 \u03b7(x) and \u1ef9 \u2208 \u03b7(y),\n(x\u0303, \u1ef9) \u2208 E(H).\nThe closure of a cell \u03b7 consists of all cells indexed by \u03b7\u0303 : V (G) \u2192 2V (H) \\ {\u2205}\nwhich satisfy the condition that \u03b7\u0303(v) \u2286 \u03b7(v), for all v \u2208 V (G).\nNote. We follow [1] in our notations.\nThe set of vertices of Hom (G, H) is Hom 0 (G, H). We note that cells of Hom (G, H)\nare\nP direct products of simplices, and that the dimension of a cell \u03b7 is equal to\nv\u2208V (G) |\u03b7(x)| \u2212 |V (G)|.\nOne can describe a labeling of the cells in Hom (G, Kn ) rather directly: they are\nindexed by all p-tuples of nonempty subsets of [n], (A1 , . . . , Ap ), where p = |V (G)|,\nand such that, if (i, j) is an edge in G, then Ai \u2229 Aj = \u2205. Also, for a cell \u03b7 \u2208\nHom (G, Kn ), we will denote with A\u03b7j its j-th coordinate set (and sometimes we will\nrefer to it as j-th color list of \u03b7). With these notations, \u03b7 = (A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7p ).\nFor any three graphs G, H and K, the following is true:\na\n(2.2)\nHom (G\nH, K) = Hom (G, K) \u00d7 Hom (H, K).\nTwo examples of complexes Hom (G, Kn ) are shown on Figure 1. Note that\nHom (K1,3 , K3 ) is a 3-dimensional complex, with 3 solid cubes and 3 intervals. Further examples can be found in [2].\n3. The fundamental group of Hom (G, Kn ) .\nWe are now ready to study the fundamental group of the graph coloring complexes.\nLet \u03bb(G), resp. p(G), denote the cardinality of a maximal independent set in G,\nresp. the number of vertices of G. We shall write \u03bb and p whenever it is clear which\nG is meant. For an arbitrary graph G, label the vertices with x1 , . . . , xp , such that\n{x1 . . . , x\u03bb } is a maximal independent set.\nLemma 3.1. Let G be an arbitrary graph, and n \u2265 2. Assume that vgap(G, n) \u2265 2.\nFor an arbitrary 1 < i \u2264 n, any closed edge-path in the 1-skeleton of Hom (G, Kn ),\nsuch that the first \u03bb coordinates of every vertex in this path are elements of the\n\n\f4\n\nSONJA LJ. \u010cUKI\u0106 AND DMITRY N.

If i \u2212 1 occurs in j-th position for both wk and wk+1 we will, similar to\nthe first step, \"separate\" them by adding new vertices to the given path.

Since vertices labeled x1 , . . . , x\u03bb form an independent set, we know\nthat N(xj ) \u2286 {x\u03bb+1 , . . . , xp }.

We can see that\nafter this step j-th coordinate of any vertex from this path is in the set {i, . . . , n}.\nFinally, we arrive at the path w(\u03bb+1) which has been obtained by a sequence\nof elementary homotopies from the original path and has the additional property\nthat the first \u03bb coordinates of every vertex from this path are elements of the set\n{i, . . . , n}.\n\u0003\nNote. This proof was motivated by the ideas from [4].\nWe would like to remark, that the Steps 1 and 2 can be combined to obtain\none reduction step encoding the following transformation: we find the first vertex\nwhere i occurs in j-th position of two vertices in a row, then we glue in a square,\nas in Step 1, and then we clip off a triangle, as in Step 2, see Figure 5.\n\n\f8\n\nSONJA LJ. \u010cUKI\u0106 AND DMITRY N. KOZLOV\n\nFigure 5.\nThe outcome of this procedure will be a shortening of the undesired part (here\nmeaning i is in the j-th position) by 1. With this line of argument, one has two\nspecial cases to attend to. First, if the undesired vertices come only as singletons,\nthen we clip them all off as in Step 2. Second, if all vertices are undesired, then\ngluing in an arbitrary square, as in Step 1, reduces this to the case which we\nconsidered first.\nThe Lemma 3.1 is the crucial step in the proof of the main result of this chapter.\nTheorem 3.2. Let G be any graph. If vgap(G, n) \u2265 2, then Hom (G, Kn ) is simply\nconnected.\nProof. We will prove that Hom (G, Kn ) is simply connected using induction on the\nmaximal valency of G. We will use the same notations as in the previous lemma.\nSuppose that the maximal valency of a graph G is 0 and that n \u2265 3. Then G is\ndisjoint union of p points and, using (2.2), we conclude:\nHom (G, Kn ) = Hom (K1 , Kn ) \u00d7 Hom (K1 , Kn ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hom (K1 , Kn ).\nHom (K1 , Kn ) is a simplex, so Hom (G, Kn ) is contractible, and hence 1-connected.\nAssume now that the maximal valency of G is equal to d \u2265 1 and that\nvgap(G, n) \u2265 2. Let \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b21 be any closed edge-path in 1-skeleton of\nHom (G, Kn ). Since Hom (G, Kn ) is a polyhedral complex, it is clear that it is sufficient to consider only these paths.\nUsing Lemma 3.1 iteratively, we can homotopicaly transform this path to a path\n\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b11 which has the property that the first \u03bb coordinates of any vertex\nfrom this path are equal to n, where {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb } is a maximal independent set\nin G. Hence, the original path is homotopic to a path lying inside the subcomplex\nHom (G \u2212 {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb }, Kn\u22121 ). That path is contractible to a point by induction\nhypothesis, since {x1 , . . . , x\u03bb } is a maximal independent set, and therefore the\nmaximal valency of G \u2212 {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb } is strictly less then d.\n\u0003\nWe will now evaluate the fundamental group of Hom (G, Kn+1 ) for one case when\nthe maximal valency of a graph G equals n \u2212 1.\n\n\fHIGHER CONNECTIVITY OF GRAPH COLORING COMPLEXES\n\n9\n\nProposition 3.3. \u03c01 (Hom (Kn , Kn+1 )) is the free product of \u03b1n copies of Z, where\n2\n\u03b1n = n! n \u2212n\u22122\n+ 1.\n2\nProof. Since Hom (Kn , Kn+1 ) is a connected graph, we can choose a spanning tree\nand contract it. Then we get a bouquet of e \u2212 v + 1 circles, where v is the number\nof vertices and e number of edges of this graph. It is easy to see that v = (n + 1)!\nand, since Hom (Kn , Kn+1 ) is n-regular, e = nv\n2 . This gives us the claim of the\nproposition.\n\u0003\n4. Homology groups of Hom (G, Kn ) complexes and the main theorem.\nIn the previous section we proved that, if the maximal valency of G is d, then\nHom (G, Kn ) is simply connected (or 1-connected), for all n \u2265 d + 3. Here we will\nprove a more general statement using the notations and ideas from Lemma 3.1 and\nTheorem 3.2.\nFirst, we will introduce a new notation. Let G be a graph with the set of vertices\nV (G) = {x1 , . . . , xp } and let 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p be an integer. Then, for all i \u2208 [n], we\ndefine a subcomplex Xi (G, j) of Hom (G, Kn ) in the following way:\nXi (G, j) = {\u03b7 \u2208 Hom (G, Kn ) | \u03b7(xq ) \u2286 {i, i + 1, . . . , n}, for all q \u2208 [j]}.\nIn other words, only colors i, . . . , n have been used in the first j vertices. For example, Lemma 3.1 is exactly pushing the loops from Xi\u22121 (G, \u03bb) into the subcomplex\nXi (G, \u03bb). If it is clear which graph G is meant, we will use the notation Xi (j)\ninstead of Xi (G, j).\nLet us again label the vertices of G in the same way as we did in Lemma 3.1,\nthat is so that the vertices labeled x1 , . . . , x\u03bb form a maximal independent set.\nLemma 4.1. Let G be a graph with the maximal valency equal to d \u2265 1. If C is\na t-cycle in Xi\u22121 (\u03bb), where 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n \u2212 d \u2212 2 and i \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , n}, then there\nexist a t-cycle C \u2032 in Xi (\u03bb) such that C and C \u2032 represent the same element in\nHt (Hom (G, Kn ), Z).\nProof. Recall that a cell \u03b7 from Hom (G, Kn ) can be described by the p-tuple\n(A\u03b71 , A\u03b72 , . . . , A\u03b7p ), where A\u03b7j \u2286 [n] for all j \u2208 [p] (p = |V (G)|). Rephrasing the\ndefinition above, we get\nXq (\u03bb) = {\u03b7 \u2208 Hom (G, Kn ) | A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7\u03bb \u2286 {q, q + 1, . . . , n}},\nfor q \u2208 [n]. The orientation of the cells \u03b7 \u2208 Hom (G, Kn ) can be chosen so that the\nboundary operator \u2202 is given by\nX\n\u2202(\u03b7) = \u2202(A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7p ) =\n(\u22121)c(x) (A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7s(x) \\ {x}, . . . , A\u03b7p ),\n\nwhere s(x) denotes the index, for which x \u2208 A\u03b7s(x) , c(x) = |A\u03b71 |+* * *+|A\u03b7s(x)\u22121 |+|{y |\ny \u2208 A\u03b7s(x) and y < x}|, and the sum is taken over all x \u2208 A\u03b71 \u222a * * * \u222a A\u03b7p , such that\n|A\u03b7s(x) | \u2265 2.\nLike in the proof of Lemma 3.1, we give a description of an algorithm whose\noutput is a cycle C \u2032 , whose existence is claimed in this lemma. General scheme of\nthe proof is the same as for already mentioned Lemma 3.1. Namely, we first get rid\nof color i on vertices x\u03bb+1 , . . . , xp , and afterwards we are removing color i \u2212 1 from\ncolor lists on all vertices from the chosen maximal independent set, see Figure 2.\nInput for our algorithm is the t-cycle C\u03bb+1 = C. For each j = \u03bb + 1, . . . , p, in\nthe increasing order of j, we repeat both of the next two inductive steps.\n\n\f10\n\nSONJA LJ. \u010cUKI\u0106 AND DMITRY N. KOZLOV\n\nStep 1: This is the only step in our proof where we use the assumption about\nmaximal valency of G. In this step we eliminate all cells \u03b7 from the cycle\nCj such that A\u03b7j = {i}. Result of this step is a cycle Cj2 with the property\nthat j-th color list of each cell from Cj2 which contains i has length \u2265 2.\nNow we have new, iterative, step. Namely, step 2 is repeated for cycles Cjl ,\nstarting from l = 2, until there exists a cell \u03c3 \u2208 Cjl such that i \u2208 A\u03c3j .\nStep 2: Transforming the cycle Cjl to a homologous cycle Cjl+1 with the property that, for all \u03b7 \u2208 Cjl+1 , if i \u2208 A\u03b7j , then |A\u03b7j | \u2265 l + 1.\nSince length of each color list is certainly less or equal to n, repetition of step\n2 will stop after finite number of iterations, and we will get a cycle Cj+1 .\nInput for the second stage of this algorithm is the cycle C1 = Cp+1 . For each cell\n\u03c3 of this cycle, i \u2208\n/ A\u03c3\u03bb+1 \u222a . . . A\u03c3p . Again, we repeat the following inductive steps\nfor all j = 1, . . . , \u03bb, in the increasing order:\nStep 3: We eliminate all cells \u03b7 from the cycle Cj such that A\u03b7j = {i \u2212 1}.\nResult of this step is a cycle Cj2 with the property that j-th color list of\neach cell from Cj2 which contains i \u2212 1 has length \u2265 2.\nStep 2 is repeated for cycles Cjl , starting from l = 2, until there exists a cell\n\u03c3 \u2208 Cjl such that i \u2212 1 \u2208 A\u03c3j .\nStep 4: Transforming the cycle Cjl to a cycle Cjl+1 , such that Cjl and Cjl+1\nrepresent the same homology element, and such that, if i \u2212 1 \u2208 A\u03b7j , then\n|A\u03b7j | \u2265 l + 1, for all cells \u03b7 \u2208 Cjl+1 .\nBy the same argument as in the first part, repetition of step 4 will stop after\nfinite number of iterations, and we will get a cycle Cj+1 . In the case when\nj = \u03bb, we label the resulting cycle with C \u2032 .\nAfter describing the algorithm, we give a detailed description of steps:\nStep 1. Let \u03b7 be a t-cell appearing in the chain Cj , such that A\u03b7j = {i}, and let \u03b7\nhave the coefficient k \u2208 Z in Cj . The dimension of \u03b7 is equal to t, and we have:\nt=\n\np\nX\n\n(|A\u03b7r | \u2212 1) = (\n\nr=1\n\nX\n\n|A\u03b7r | \u2212 |N(xj )|) + (|A\u03b7j | \u2212 1)+\n\nr|xr \u2208N(xj )\n\n+(\n\nX\n\nr|xr \u2208N(x\n/\nj ),\nr6=j\n\n|A\u03b7r | \u2212 (p \u2212 |N(xj )| \u2212 1)) \u2265\n\nX\n\n|A\u03b7r | \u2212 d,\n\nr\u2208[p]\nxr \u2208N(xj )\n\nsince the second term in the middle sum is 0, the third term in the middle sum is\nnonnegative, and |N(xj )| \u2264 d. It follows that\nX\n|A\u03b7r | \u2264 t + d \u2264 n \u2212 2;\nr\u2208[p]\nxr \u2208N(xj )\n\nas we recall that, by assumption of the lemma, t \u2264 n \u2212 d \u2212 2. Hence, there exists\nI(\u03b7) \u2208 [n]\\{i} such that \u03b7 \u2032 = (A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7j\u22121 , {i, I(\u03b7)}, A\u03b7j+1 , . . . , A\u03b7p ) \u2208 Hom (G, Kn ).\n\u2032\n\u2032\nObviously, dim \u03b7 \u2032 = t + 1. Set Cj\u2032 = Cj \u2212 (\u22121)K(\u03b7 ) k \u2202\u03b7 \u2032 , where (\u22121)K(\u03b7 ) comes\n\n\fHIGHER CONNECTIVITY OF GRAPH COLORING COMPLEXES\n\n11\n\nfrom the appropriate incidence number, i.e., in our notations\n\u001a\n1, if i < I(\u03b7);\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u2032\nK(\u03b7 ) = |A1 | + * * * + |Aj\u22121 | +\n0, otherwise.\nClearly, Cj\u2032 represents the same homology element as Cj . Furthermore, the number\nof cells \u03c3 appearing in Cj\u2032 , such that A\u03c3j = {i}, is strictly less then number of such\ncells appearing in Cj , since we have just eliminated the appearance of the cell \u03b7.\nWe repeat this procedure until we get cycle Cj2 in which there are no cells \u03c3 such\nthat A\u03c3j = {i}.\nStep 2. Suppose now that we have a cycle Cjl , l \u2265 2, which represents the same\nelement in homology as Cj , and which has the additional property that |A\u03b7j | \u2265 l,\nfor each cell \u03b7 appearing in Cjl , such that i \u2208 A\u03b7j . If no such cell exists, we are done\nwith this case, and we set Cj+1 := Cjl .

If for all cells \u03be from\nCj we have that A\u03beb \u2286 Sb , for b \u2208 [p] and Sb \u2286 [n], then also for all \u03be \u2032 from Cj+1\n\u2032\nand b \u2208 [p], we have A\u03beb \u2286 Sb .\n\n\f14\n\nSONJA LJ. \u010cUKI\u0106 AND DMITRY N. KOZLOV\n\nAfter first phase, we shall eventually obtain a chain C1 := Cp+1 which has the\nfollowing additional property: for all cells \u03b7 appearing in this chain with a nonzero\ncoefficient, we have A\u03b7j \u2286 {i \u2212 1, i, . . . , n}, for j \u2208 [\u03bb] (the original condition of the\nlemma preserved), and i \u2208\n/ A\u03b7j , for j \u2208 {\u03bb + 1, . . . , p}.\nStep 3. This step is almost the same as Step 1. Namely, assume \u03b7 is a cell from Cj\nsuch that coefficient of \u03b7 in Cj is k, and A\u03b7j = {i\u22121}. Then \u03b7 \u2032 = (A\u03b71 , . . . , A\u03b7j\u22121 , {i\u2212\n1, i}, A\u03b7j+1 , . . . , A\u03b7p ) \u2208 Hom (G, Kn ), since i \u2208\n/ A\u03b7q , for all q such that xq \u2208 N(xj ).\n\u2032\nK(\u03b7 \u2032 )\n\u2032\nAgain, Cj = Cj \u2212 (\u22121)\nk \u2202\u03b7 , where K(\u03b7 \u2032 ) = |A\u03b71 | + * * * + |A\u03b7j\u22121 | + 1, is a chain\nhomologous to Cj and number of cells \u03c3 from Cj\u2032 such that A\u03c3j = {i \u2212 1} is strictly\nless then number of such cells from Cj . We repeat this procedure until we get cycle\nCj2 in which there are no cells \u03c3 such that A\u03c3j = {i \u2212 1}.\nStep 4. This step is very similar to the Step 2. The only difference is that we are\n\"removing\" i \u2212 1 (instead of i) from j-th coordinate sets of each cell from the chain\nCj and obtain a new chain Cj+1 such that i \u2212 1 \u2208\n/ A\u03b7j for each \u03b7 from Cj+1 . By the\nobservation that we have made after Step 2, we see that, for all cells \u03b7 from Cj+1\nand for all q \u2208 [j], we have A\u03b7j \u2286 {i, i + 1, . . . , n}. In the case when j = \u03bb, we set\nC \u2032 := Cj+1 .\nNow it is easy to see that C \u2032 \u2208 Xi (\u03bb) and that C \u2212 C \u2032 , is a boundary of some\n(t + 1)-chain of Hom (G, Kn ), and we have proved our claim.\n\u0003\nExample.

For simplicity, we will use slightly different notations for cells, for\nexample we will write (1, 67, 234, 2) instead of ({1}, {6, 7}, {2, 3, 4}, {2}). We have\nordered vertices of C4 as described in Lemma 3.1, see Figure 6(a).\nLet C = C3 = \u2212(1, 7, 234, 2) + (1, 6, 234, 2) \u2212 (1, 67, 34, 2) + (1, 67, 24, 2) +\n(1,\n7, 235, 2) \u2212 (1, 6, 235, 2) + (1, 67, 35, 2) \u2212 (1, 67, 25, 2) \u2208 X1 (2).

If we do the same thing for the subchain D3;1,6,\u00c2j ,2 , we will get the\ncycle C4 = \u2212(1, 67, 34, 2) + (1, 67, 35, 2) \u2212 (1, 67, 45, 2) \u2212 (1, 7, 345, 2) + (1, 6, 345, 2).\nNow we apply Step 1 for j = 4: Let \u03b7 = (1, 67, 34, 2), k = \u22121. We see that, in\nthis case, I(\u03b7) could be any element from the set {3, 4, 5}, but for convenience, we\nwill choose \u03b7 \u2032 = (1, 67, 34, 23). Then C4\u2032 = C4 + \u2202\u03b7 \u2032 . Repeating this for all cells\nsuch that their fourth coordinate set is {2}, with additional remark that we always\npick I(\u03b7) = 3, we get a chain C1 = \u2212(1, 67, 34, 3) + (1, 67, 35, 3) \u2212 (1, 7, 345, 3) +\n(1, 6, 345, 3) \u2212 (1, 67, 45, 3).\nLet us now remove 1 from the first two coordinate sets of all cells from C1 .\nFirst we apply Step 3: Let \u03b7 = (1, 67, 34, 3).

Also, let C\nbe a t-cycle from Hom (G, Kn ), that is dimension of all cells from C is equal to t\nand \u2202C = 0, where the boundary operator is defined in the proof of Lemma 4.1.\nIn order to prove that Ht (Hom (G, Kn ), Z) = 0, we need to prove that C bounds.\nAgain, we will use induction on the maximal valency of G.\nLet the maximal valency of a graph G be zero. In the Theorem 3.2 we proved\nthat in this case Hom (G, Kn ) is contractible and hence, Ht (Hom (G, Kn ), Z) = 0 for\nall 0 \u2264 t \u2264 n \u2212 2 and there exists a chain D such that C = \u2202D.\nAssume now that the maximal valency of G is d \u2265 1. By Lemma 4.1, there\nexists a cycle C \u2032 which is homologous to C and which has the property that, for\nall cells \u03b7 with nonzero coefficients in this cycle and for all q \u2208 [\u03bb], A\u03b7q = {n}.\nHence, C \u2032 is isomorphic to a cycle inside Hom (G \u2212 {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb }, Kn\u22121 ). The\nset {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb } is a maximal independent set in G, therefore, the maximal\nvalency of G \u2212 {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb } is strictly less then the maximal valency of G. It\nfollows that C \u2032 is a boundary in Hom (G \u2212 {x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u03bb }, Kn\u22121 ) by the induction\nhypothesis. We conclude that there exists a (t + 1)-chain D in Hom (G, Kn ), such\nthat \u2202D = C.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3. It was proved in [1] that:\nHi (Hom (C2r+1 , Kn ); Z) = 0, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 4.\n\n\f16\n\nSONJA LJ. \u010cUKI\u0106 AND DMITRY N. KOZLOV\n\nThis fact is a direct corollary of the previous theorem since the maximal valency of\nC2r+1 is equal to 2.\nFinally, we are able to put the pieces together and prove the Conjecture 1.1.\nProof of the Conjecture 1.1.\nThe cases when vgap(G, n) = 0, 1 were observed in [2, Proposition 2.4]. The case\nvgap(G, n) = 2 is proven in Theorem 3.2.\nLet us now deal with case vgap(G, n) \u2265 3. By the Theorem 3.2, Hom (G, Kn ) is\n1-connected, and by the Theorem 4.2 we have,\nHt (Hom (G, Kn ), Z) = Ht (Hom (G, Kn )) = 0,\nfor all 1 \u2264 t \u2264 vgap(G, n) \u2212 1. By a standard corollary to the Hurewitz theorem\n(see, for example, [5, 10.10 Corollary, page 479]), we have that \u03c0t (Hom (G, Kn ), \u2217) =\n0, for all t \u2264 vgap(G, n) \u2212 1, and, hence conn Hom (G, Kn ) \u2265 vgap(G, n) \u2212 1 by\ndefinition.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.4. We know that the result of Conjecture 1.1 is sharp for several classes\nof graphs, for example for odd cycles and complete graphs.\nRemark 4.5. By the same corollary we used in the proof of Conjecture 1.1, we\nconclude that \u03c0vgap(G,n) (Hom (G, Kn ), \u2217) \u2248 Hvgap(G,n) (Hom (G, Kn )).\nCorollary 4.6. The complex Hom (Cr , Kn ) is (n \u2212 4)-connected, for arbitrary integers r, n \u2265 3.\nReferences\n[1] E. Babson, D.N. Kozlov, Topological obstructions to graph colorings, Electron. Res.
