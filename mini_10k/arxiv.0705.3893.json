Introductory Description of Classical PT Symmetry\nThe differential equations that describe many classical dynamical systems are PT\nsymmetric; that is, these equations are invariant under combined space and time\nreflection. The equation for the simple pendulum [1], the Korteweg-de Vries and\ngeneralized Korteweg-de Vries equations [2], the Camassa-Holm equation [2, 3], the SineGordon equation [2], the Boussinesq equation [4], and the classical equations [5, 6, 7, 8]\nassociated with some non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical systems [9, 10, 11, 12] are all\nPT -symmetric.\nIn this paper we focus on Euler's differential equations, which govern the free threedimensional rotation of a rigid body about its center of mass. In dimensionless form\nthese equations may be written very simply as\nL\u03071 = L2 L3 ,\n\nL\u03072 = \u22122L1 L3 ,\n\nL\u03073 = L1 L2 .\n\n\u2021 Permanent address: Department of Physics, Washington University, St. Louis MO 63130, USA\n\n(1)\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n2\n\nThe three-dimensional classical dynamical system described by the Euler equations has\nbeen studied in detail, the critical points are known, the real solutions to these equations\nhave been found, and the structure of the phase-space trajectories is well understood\n[13]. However, until now it has not been noticed that Euler's equations, like the classical\ndifferential equations mentioned above, are PT symmetric. This paper examines the\ncomplex PT -symmetric solutions to this system of equations. It also explores this wider\nclass of solutions for some other PT-symmetric dynamical systems.\nWe begin by defining what is meant by PT symmetry for classical physical\nsystems. We say that a real differential equation that describes classical dynamics is PT\nsymmetric if it remains invariant under the combined operations of parity reflection P,\nwhich changes the sign of all spatial coordinates x, and time reversal T , which changes\nthe sign of the time coordinate t. Furthermore, since the operation of time reversal\nin quantum mechanics is associated with complex conjugation, we include complex\nconjugation in the time-reversal operation when the differential equation is complex.\nThus, under PT reflection we replace the dependent variable f (x, t) of a differential\nequation by f \u2217 (\u2212x, \u2212t), where \u2217 represents complex conjugation. If f \u2217 (\u2212x, \u2212t) satisfies\nthe same differential equation as f (x, t), then the differential equation is PT symmetric.\nFor the special case of Hamiltonian systems of ordinary differential equations, the\nsolutions x(t) = [x1 (t), x2 (t), x3 (t), . . .] and p(t) = [p1 (t), p2 (t), p3 (t), . . .] represent the\ndynamical coordinate and momentum variables. Under PT reflection x(t) is replaced\nby \u2212x\u2217 (\u2212t) and p(t) is replaced by p\u2217 (\u2212t). For the Euler equations (1), the dependent\nvariables [L1 (t), L2 (t), L3 (t)] represent the angular momentum n the rotating frame of\na rigid body and therefore these variables transform under PT reflection like spatial\ncoordinate variables: [L1 (t), L2 (t), L3 (t)] \u2192 [\u2212L\u22171 (\u2212t), \u2212L\u22172 (\u2212t), \u2212L\u22173 (\u2212t)]. It is clear\nfrom this definition that the Euler equations (1) are PT symmetric. (We treat time t\nas a real parameter; the case of complex time is not considered in this paper.)\nA solution x(t) to a system of dynamical differential equations is a trajectory in\ncoordinate space parameterized by time t. The PT reflection of this curve, represented\nby \u2212x\u2217 (\u2212t), is the mirror image of the original curve x(t) reflected through the\nimaginary-x axis. A solution to a differential equation may or may not exhibit the\nsymmetries of the differential equation. An easy way to determine if the solution to a\nPT -symmetric differential equation is itself PT symmetric is to draw the solution curve\nand to see if the curve is symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis.\nExample 1: Complex classical trajectories for the anharmonic oscillator. The one-dimensional\nclassical anharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian H = 12 p2 + x4 gives Hamilton's equations\n\u1e8b = p,\n\n\u1e57 = \u22124x3 .\n\n(2)\n\nThis dynamical system is PT symmetric. There is one integral of the motion (the energy is\nconserved), and thus the system can be reduced to a single first-order equation:\n1 2\n2 \u1e8b\n\n+ x4 = E,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the integration constant E may be complex. Note that even though (2) is PT symmetric,\nits first integral (3) need not respect PT symmetry. However, requiring that (3) be PT symmetric\ntranslates into the physical condition that E be real and allows us to interpret E as an energy.\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Classical PT -symmetric trajectories in the complex-x plane representing\nthe possible motions of a particle of energy 1. This motion is governed by the\nanharmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian H = 12 p2 + x4 . There is one real trajectory that\noscillates between the turning points at x = \u00b11 and an infinite family of nested complex\ntrajectories that enclose the real turning points but lie inside the imaginary turning\npoints at \u00b1i. (The turning points are indicated by dots.) Two other trajectories begin\nat the imaginary turning points and drift off to infinity along the imaginary-x axis.\nApart from the trajectories beginning at \u00b1i, all trajectories\nare\np\n\u0001 closed\n\u0001 and periodic.\nAll closed orbits in this figure have the same period \u03c0/2 \u0393 14 /\u0393 43 = 3.70815 . . ..\n\nSuppose first that E is real and positive. We rescale t and x(t) so that E = 1, and the four\nturning points in the complex-x plane are located at \u00b11 and \u00b1i. The conventional real periodic\nmotion of the system is represented by a trajectory that lies on the real axis and oscillates between\nthe turning points at \u00b11 (see Fig. 1). However, this real solution to (3) is only one of an infinite\nnumber of possible complex trajectories having the same energy. All but two of these trajectories\nlie outside the real turning points and inside the complex turning points, as shown in Fig. 1, and\nthey are closed and periodic. The remaining two trajectories each begin at the turning points at\n\u00b1i and run off to infinity in finite time along the imaginary axis. Note that all of these trajectories\nare PT symmetric; that is, symmetric under reflections about the imaginary axis.\nNext, suppose that E is complex. For this case the resulting trajectories are no longer PT\nsymmetric and are not closed and periodic. In Fig. 2 the trajectory for a particle whose energy is\nE = 1 + i is plotted. The trajectory begins at x = 1 and does not close.\n\nThis anharmonic-oscillator example shows that the conventional real solutions to\nthe classical equations of motion (2) form a trivial lower-dimensional subset of the class\nof complex PT -symmetric solutions shown in Fig. 1. The PT -symmetric solutions in\nFig. 1 in turn constitute a subset of the much larger class of all possible complex solutions\n(see Fig. 2). However, in this paper we limit our attention to the PT -symmetric classical\nsolutions because these solutions have real energy.\nThe PT -symmetric solutions of the classical anharmonic oscillator are special\nbecause they form closed and periodic orbits. Indeed, when the classical particles exhibit\nPT -symmetric motion in the complex plane, they are bound in a complex classical atom\nand cannot escape to infinity. (By the term complex atom we mean a localized spacefilling collection of closed and periodic orbits.) If one quantizes this classical system\n\u0001\nH\nusing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition dx p = n + 21 \u03c0, one obtains the\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. A single non-PT -symmetric classical trajectory in the complex-x plane for\na particle governed by the anharmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian H = 12 p2 + x4 . This\ntrajectory begins at x = 1 and represents the complex path of a particle whose energy\nE = 1 + i is complex. The trajectory is not periodic because it is not closed. The four\nturning points are indicated by dots.\n\nusual WKB approximation to the discrete energy levels of the quantum anharmonic\noscillator, independently of which closed classical orbit is chosen as the integration\npath. (The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition cannot be applied to the non-PT symmetric classical orbit in Fig. 2 because this orbit is not closed and periodic.) Since\nit is the PT -symmetric classical orbits that give rise to the energies of the associated\nquantum system, we regard the PT -symmetric orbits as physically relevant. Thus, the\ncorrespondence principle establishes an association between the family of PT -symmetric\nclassical orbits and the quantum system.\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition requires that the classical orbit be\nclosed. Since the trajectory of a particle in the complex-x plane cannot cross itself,\nthe condition of PT symmetry is often strong enough to ensure that the trajectory is\nclosed. However, it is possible to have PT -symmetric trajectories that are not closed [7].\nIn such cases, the quantum Hamiltonian has complex eigenvalues and is said to have\na broken PT symmetry. It is possible (though quite rare) to have non-PT -symmetric\ntrajectories that are closed and periodic, as the following example shows.\nExample 2: Closed and periodic trajectories that are not PT symmetric. The one-dimensional\nclassical harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian H = 21 p2 + 12 x2 has complex trajectories that are\nperiodic, but not PT symmetric. For this Hamiltonian the equations of motion are\n\u1e8b = p,\n\n\u1e57 = \u2212x.\n\n(4)\n\nThese equations are PT symmetric. There is one integral of the motion (the energy is conserved),\nand thus this system can be reduced to the single first-order equation\n\u1e8b2 + x2 = 2E 2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the energy E 2 is a constant that may be real or complex. The general solution to (5) is\nx(t) = E cos(t + A + iB), where A and B are arbitrary real constants. If E is real, then\nRe x(t) = E cos(t + A) cosh(B),\n\nIm x(t) = E sin(t + A) sinh(B).\n\n(6)\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Classical PT -symmetric trajectories in the complex-x plane for the\nharmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian H = 21 p2 + 12 x2 . These trajectories are the complex\npaths x(t) = E cos(t + A + iB) of a particle whose energy E 2 is real. The trajectories\nshown are a family\u221aof nested ellipses with foci located at the turning points denoted\nby dots at x = \u00b1E 2. We have chosen E to be real, so the turning points lie on the\nreal-x axis. (We could equally well have chosen E to be imaginary, and in this case the\nturning points would lie on the imaginary axis.) The real line segment (a degenerate\nellipse) connecting the turning points is the conventional real periodic classical solution\nto the harmonic oscillator. For E 2 = 1 the elliptical trajectories are closed orbits, all\nhaving the same period 2\u03c0.\n\nThus, the graph of the trajectory x(t) in the complex-x plane is the ellipse\n[Re x(t)]2 [E cosh(B)]\u22122 + [Im x(t)]2 [E sinh(B)]\u22122 = 1\n\n(7)\n\nwith semi-major and semi-minor axes |E cosh(B)| and |E sinh(B)|. Ellipses of the form in (7) are\nshown in Fig. 3. These ellipses are PT symmetric; that is, they are symmetric with respect to\nreflections about the imaginary axis. When E is real (imaginary), the turning points at \u00b1E lie\non the real (imaginary) axis. If the energy E 2 is complex, then the classical trajectories are no\nlonger PT symmetric, as we can see in Fig. 4. However, they are still closed and periodic.\n\nThe Lotka-Volterra equations provide a nice two-dimensional example of a PT symmetric dynamical system whose complex solutions are generally nonperiodic but\nwhose PT -symmetric complex solutions are periodic.\nExample 3: PT -symmetric solutions to the Volterra equations: If we generalize slightly the\ndefinition of P reflection to be P : (x, y) \u2192 (y, x) [14], then the Lotka-Volterra equations\n\u1e8b = x \u2212 xy,\n\n\u1e8f = \u2212y + xy\n\n(8)\n\nbecome PT symmetric. It is well known that the positive real solutions to these equations are\nperiodic they and provide a useful description of predator-prey population dynamics, where x(t)\nrepresents the population of the prey species and y(t) represents the population of the predator\nspecies. There is one constant of the motion for the Lotka-Volterra equations:\nx + y \u2212 log(xy) = C.\n\n(9)\n\nFor complex solutions C is generally a complex constant, but for PT -symmetric complex solutions\nC must be real.\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n6\n\nFigure 4. Classical non-PT -symmetric trajectories in the complex-x plane for the\nharmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian H = 12 p2 + 12 x2 . These trajectories are complex paths\nof the form x(t) = E cos(t + A + iB) for a particle whose energy E 2 is complex. The\ntrajectories shown are not PT symmetric, but they are still closed and periodic. The\ntwo turning points are indicated by dots.\n\nFigure 5.

Observe that\nthe trajectories are periodic and PT symmetric, where P reflection interchanges x and\ny and T reflection consists of complex conjugation.\n\nWe first choose the set of initial conditions x(0) = 1 + i, y(0) = 2.11221 \u2212 0.403243i for which\nC = 2 is real. The complex PT -symmetric solution, which is plotted in Fig. 5, is closed and\nperiodic. Next, we choose the set of initial conditions x(0) = 1 + i, y(0) = 1.09704 + 1.81173i\nfor which C = 1 + i is complex. The complex solution, which is plotted in Fig. 6, is not PT\nsymmetric and is not closed and periodic.\n\nNon-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians having unbroken PT symmetry\nare interesting because these operators have only real eigenvalues. Because of the\nquantum-classical correspondence principle, some light might be shed on the meaning\nof these quantum states by considering the PT -symmetric complex solutions of the\nequations of classical mechanics. The first examples studied have been the PT symmetric complex solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator H = p2 +x2 (ix)\u000f\n(\u000f \u2265 0) [9, 10, 11, 12]. The Hermitian quantum version of the Hamiltonian that describes\nrigid body rotation was treated in the doctoral thesis of Casimir [15]. As far as we know,\nthe PT -symmetric quantum version of this problem has not yet been treated.\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n7\n\nFigure 6.

In Sec. 2 the Euler equations (1) for free rigid-body rotation are derived\nand their complex solutions are examined. Some concluding remarks are given in Sec. 3.\n2. Complex Angular Momentum Dynamics\nThe complex body-angular-momentum solutions L(t) \u2208 C3 satisfy Euler's equations [16]\n\u2202C \u2202E\nL\u0307 =\n\u00d7\n,\n(10)\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\nwhere C and E are conserved quadratic functions defined by\nC(L) = 12 L * L,\n\nE(L) = 21 L * I\u22121 L.\n\n(11)\n\nHere, I\u22121 = diag(I1\u22121 , I2\u22121 , I3\u22121 ) is the inverse of the (real) moment-of-inertia tensor\nin principal-axis coordinates. These equations are PT symmetric; they are invariant\nunder spatial reflections of the angular momentum components in the body P : L \u2192 L\ncomposed with time reversal T : L \u2192 \u2212L.\nWe now make the simplifying choice I\u22121 \u2261 diag(1, 2, 3), which reduces (10) to\nEuler's dynamical equations in (1). Equation (1) may be written equivalently as\nL\u0307 = L \u00d7 KL\n\nwith\n\nK \u2261 diag(\u22121, 0, 1).\n\n(12)\n\nSince L is complex, we set L = x + iy and obtain four conservation laws, the real\nand imaginary parts of C(L) = 12 L * L and H(L) = 21 L * KL = E(L) \u2212 2C(L), where\nC(L) = 21 x * x \u2212 21 y * y + ix * y,\n\nH(L) = 21 x * Kx \u2212 12 y * Ky + ix * Ky.(13)\n\nThe solutions to Euler's equations that have been studied in the past are the real\nsolutions to (12), that is, the solutions for which y = 0. For this case the phase space\nis three dimensional and the two conserved quantities are\n\u0001\n(14)\nC = 21 x21 + x22 + x23 , H = 12 x23 \u2212 12 x21 .\nIf we take C = 12 , then the phase-space trajectories are constrained to a sphere of radius\n1. There are six critical points located at (\u00b11, 0, 0), (0, \u00b11, 0), and (0, 0, \u00b11). The\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n8\n\nFigure 7. Real phase-space trajectories for Euler's equations (1). Choosing C = 12\nin (14) limits these trajectories to the surface of a three-dimensional sphere of radius\n1. The critical points lie at (\u00b11, 0, 0), (0, \u00b11, 0), and (0, 0, \u00b11). The trajectories for\nvarious values of H in (14) are shown.\n\ntrajectories for various values of H are shown in Fig. 7. These are the conventional\ntrajectories that are discussed in standard textbooks on dynamical systems [13]. (When\nH = 0, the resulting equation is a first integral of the simple pendulum problem [1].)\nLet us now examine the complex PT -symmetric solutions to Euler's equations (12).\nFor this case phase space is six dimensional, which is difficult to visualize. However, the\nrequirement of PT symmetry implies that the constants of motion C and H in (13) are\nreal. The vanishing of the imaginary parts of C and H gives the two equations:\nx * y = 0,\n\nx * Ky = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nThese two bilinear constraints may be used to eliminate the y terms in the complex\nequations (12). When this elimination is performed one obtains the following real\nequations for x on the PT constraint manifolds (15):\n\u1e8b = x \u00d7 Kx + M (x) x.\n\n(16)\n\nHere, the scalar function M = P N/D, where the functions P , N , and D are given by\nP (x) = 2x1 x2 x3 ,\nN (x) = x21 + x22 + x23 \u2212 1,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202C \u2202H\nD(x) = Re\n\u00d7\n= x21 x22 + x22 x23 + 4x21 x23 .\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\n(17)\n\n(This form may be helpful in thinking about the PT-symmetric quantum spin problem.)\nThe system (16) has nonzero divergence, so it cannot be Hamiltonian even though\nit arises from constraining a Hamiltonian system. Nonetheless, the system has two\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n9\n\nFigure 8. Level surfaces in (x1 , x2 , x3 ) space for the two constants of the motion, A\nand B in (19).

(19)\nA=\nD\nD\nIn Fig. 8 the level surfaces in (x1 , x2 , x3 ) space are displayed for three values of A and\nfor three values of B.\nThe PT -symmetric trajectories in (x1 , x2 , x3 ) space are characterized by the values\nof A and B in (19) and these trajectories are precisely the intersections of the level\nsurfaces shown in the top and bottom rows of Fig. 8. For example, in Fig. 9 the level\nsurfaces corresponding to A = 1 and B = 0 are superposed. One can see that the\nintersection of these surfaces is a pair of closed butterfly-shaped curves in (x1 , x2 , x3 )\nspace. In Fig. 10 many such butterfly-shaped trajectories are shown, and all such\ntrajectories are closed and periodic. All of these trajectories lie outside a unit ball\ncentered at the origin.\nIn Fig. 11 we display the PT -symmetric trajectories that lie inside the unit ball\ncentered at the origin. All of these trajectories pass through the origin. However, these\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n10\n\nFigure 9. Superposition of two level surfaces in Fig. 8 corresponding to A = 1 and\nB = 0. The trajectory, which is the intersection of these two level surfaces, is a closed\nbutterfly-shaped curve in (x1 , x2 , x3 ) space.\n\ntrajectories are periodic and do not stop at the origin. While one can see from (1) that\nthe origin is a critical point for real trajectories, it is clear from (17) and (18) that the\norigin in (x1 , x2 , x3 ) space is not a critical point.\n3. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have used the Euler equations for the free rotation of a rigid body\nabout its center of mass to illustrate the following picture: Given a real dynamical\nsystem of differential equations, the real solutions form a tiny subset of the rich and\ninteresting class of complex solutions. If this system is PT symmetric, then some of\nthe complex solutions will themselves be PT symmetric. The PT -symmetric solutions\nare characterized by having real constants of the motion, such as the energy, and thus\nwe view these solutions as being physical. The PT -symmetric trajectories are different\nfrom the other complex trajectories in that they are closed and periodic. For example,\nif we take the constants of the motion in (13) to be complex, H = 1 + i and C = 1 + i,\nthen we see in Fig. 12 that while the complex trajectories resemble the butterfly-shaped\norbits shown in Fig. 10, they are open rather than closed and periodic orbits. Our results\nindicate that the following three statements are equivalent: (i) A complex rotating-rigidbody solution is PT symmetric; (ii) its constants of motion are real; (iii) it is periodic\n(except for possible heteroclinic cycles).\nIt is crucial that the trajectories of a classical dynamical system be multiply\n\n\fComplexified Dynamical Systems\n\n11\n\nFigure 10. Closed and periodic butterfly-shaped trajectories plotted in (x1 , x2 , x3 )\nspace. At the center of the figure there are no trajectories indicated. All curves shown\nin this figure lie outside the unit ball centered at the origin. Trajectories on the unit\nball are shown in Fig. 7. The trajectories that lie inside the unit ball are shown in\nFig. 11. Trajectories outside the unit ball never cross to the interior of the unit ball.\n\nperiodic because only then do the methods of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization apply. In\nconventional quantum mechanics only the real phase-space trajectories are considered,\nand these trajectories terminate at the turning points. On the other side of the turning\npoints is the so-called \"classically-forbidden region.\" We take a broader view and argue\nthat the set of all PT -symmetric classical orbits constitutes a complex atom. Any one\nof these orbits can be used to determine the energy levels of the associated quantum\nsystem because these orbits are closed and thus Cauchy's theorem implies that the\nenergy levels so obtained will be unique. Furthermore, the reality of the energy levels,\nwhich is a crucial property of a physical quantum system, is a consequence of the PT\nsymmetry of the underlying classical system.\nWe thank J.
