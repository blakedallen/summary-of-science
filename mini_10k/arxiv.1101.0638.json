K. Donaldson on constant scalar curvature metrics on toric complex surfaces, we study obstructions to the\nextension of the Calabi flow on a polarized toric variety. Under some\ntechnical assumptions, we prove that the Calabi flow can be extended\nfor all time.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn [4], E. Calabi proposed to deform a given K\u00e4hler metric in the direction of\nthe Levi-Hessian of its scalar curvature. This is a 4th order fully nonlinear\nsemiparabolic equation aiming to attack the existence of constant scalar\ncurvature K\u00e4hler metric (cscK for short) in a given K\u00e4hler class. Note\nthat cscK metrics are the fixed points while extremal K\u00e4hler metrics are\nsoliton solutions of the Calabi flow. The Calabi conjecture on the existence\nof K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics, as well as Yau-Tian-Donaldson's conjecture on\nthe existence of extremal K\u00e4hler metrics are central problems in K\u00e4hler\ngeometry. However, by fixing a maximal torus in the complex automorphism\ngroup, an extremal K\u00e4hler metric satisfies a 4th order nonlinear partial\ndifferential equation. It is hard to attack the existence problem directly.\nThe study of the Calabi flow seems to be an effective approach, although\nrather a complicated one. In [6], Xiuxiong Chen conjectured that the flow\nexists globally (i.e. for all time) for any smooth initial K\u00e4hler metric.\nUnfortunately, at the moment very little is known about the global existence of the Calabi flow. In the Riemannian surface case, it was settled\ndown by the work of P. Chrusci\u00e9l [10] (c.f. [6] also). In a subsequent paper\n[7], Xiuxiong Chen and Weiyong He proved that the main obstruction to\nthe global existence of the Calabi flow is the bound of the Ricci curvature.\nOther important results about Calabi flow appear in Chen-He [8], [9]; W.Y.\nHe [18]; J. Fine [15]; G. Sz\u00eakelyhidi [21].\nS.K. Donaldson [11] set up a program to prove the existence of an extremal K\u00e4hler metric on a toric surface under the K-stability assumption\nand he completed this program in the cscK case in [14]. Let us briefly\nintroduce Donaldson's results.\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.1. ([14]) Any polarized complex toric surface with zero Futaki\ninvariant is K-stable if and only if it admits a constant scalar curvature\nK\u00e4hler metric.\nHis strategy of proof is as follows: if we consider the Legendre transform u of a K\u00e4hler potential \u03c6, then we obtain a convex function u on the\npolytope P \u2282 R2 associated to the toric variety, satisfying certain boundary\nconditions defined by a measure \u03c3 on each facet of P (see Definition 3.1).\nThe Abreu's equation tells us that the metric is extremal if and only if\nuij ij = \u2212A,\nwhere A is an affine function determined by the data (P, \u03c3). We need to\nsolve this 4-th order differential equation when A is a constant and u is a\nsmooth convex function and verifies the given boundary conditions. Then,\nDonaldson applied the continuity method to prove the following theorem\n(c.f. Theorem 1 in [13]) :\nTheorem 1.2. ([13]) Let (P (\u03b1), \u03c3(\u03b1), A(\u03b1)) be a sequence of polytopes converging to (P, \u03c3, A) where the number of edges of P (\u03b1) does not depend on\n\u03b1. Suppose that for each \u03b1 there is a solution u(\u03b1) to the problem defined\nby (P (\u03b1), \u03c3(\u03b1), A(\u03b1)), i.e.\nu(\u03b1)ijij = \u2212A(\u03b1),\nwhere A(\u03b1) is a constant and u(\u03b1) satisfies the Guillemin boundary conditions of (P (\u03b1), \u03c3(\u03b1)). If there is an M > 0 such that each u(\u03b1) satisfies the\nM -condition given by Definition 3.3 below, then there is a solution of the\nproblem defined by (P, A, \u03c3), i.e. there is a smooth function u such that\nuijij = \u2212A\nand u satisfies the Guillemin boundary conditions of (P, \u03c3).\nInspired by this work of Donaldson, we attempt to study the Calabi flow\non an n-dimensional toric variety. The main theorem we obtain is\nTheorem 1.3. For any toric K\u00e4hler variety, the Calabi flow (initiated from\nany toric invariant metric) can be extended indefinitely as long as the following assumptions hold\n\u2022 The Ln -norm of the Riemannian curvature is bounded for any finite\ntime interval [0, T ).\n\u2022 At each time t \u2208 [0, T ), after rescaling the metric by |Rm|\u221e , the first\nderivative of the Riemannian curvature is uniformly bounded.\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The Euclidean norm of the gradient of scalar curvature on the polytope\ni.e. |\u2207R|, are uniformly bounded for all time.\nRemark 1.4. For K\u00e4hler surfaces, the first assumption is automatically true\nsince the Calabi flow decreases the Calabi energy, hence the L2 -norm of\nRiemannian curvature. To get rid of the second assumption, one needs to\nextend Shi's Ricci flow pointwise curvature estimates [20] to the Calabi flow.\nThe last condition is imposed to guarantee that the M -condition holds along\nthe Calabi flow. If one can extend Perelman's Ricci flow non-collapsing result\n[19] to the Calabi flow, then the third assumption is not needed.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we set up the\nnotations for the K\u00e4hler geometry and the Calabi flow as in [7]. In section 3,\nwe give a brief introduction to polarized toric varieties and study the Calabi\nflow in the corresponding polytope. In section 4, we extend Donaldson's\ngeometrical estimates [13] from dimension two to higher dimensions. In section 5, we rule out the singularities in the Calabi flow under the assumptions\nof Theorem 1.3.\nAcknowledgment This paper is a part of the author's PhD thesis.\nThe author would like to thank his advisor Xiuxiong Chen for drawing his\nattention to this problem and sharing insightful ideas with him. He also\nwants to thank Professor Pengfei Guan and Professor Vestislav Apostolov\nfor many useful suggestions. He is grateful to Fang Yuan and Song Sun for\ndiscussions on related topics. He would like to express his gratitude to the\nreferee for careful readings and many suggestions.\n\n2\n\nK\u00e4hler geometry and Calabi flow\n\nLet M be a compact complex manifold of complex dimension n. A Hermitian\nmetric metric g on M in local coordinates is given by\ng = gij\u0304 dz i \u2297 dz j\u0304\nwhere {gij\u0304 } is a positive definite Hermitian matrix with smooth dependence\non the coordinates. We use {gij\u0304 } to denote the inverse matrix of {gij\u0304 }. The\n\u221a\nK\u00e4hler condition says that the corresponding K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 = \u22121gij\u0304 dz i \u2227\ndz j\u0304 is a closed (1, 1) form. The K\u00e4hler class of \u03c9 is its cohomology class\n[\u03c9] \u2208 H 2 (M, R). By Hodge theory, any other K\u00e4hler form in the same class\nis of the form\n\u221a\n \u0304 > 0,\n\u03c9\u03c6 = \u03c9 + \u22121\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nfor some real valued function \u03c6 on M , where\n \u0304 =\n\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\n\nn\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\n\u2202i \u2202j\u0304 \u03c6dz i \u2227 dz j\u0304 = \u03c6,ij\u0304 dz i \u2227 dz j\u0304 .\n3\n\n\fThe corresponding K\u00e4hler metric is denoted by g\u03c6 = (gij\u0304 + \u03c6,ij\u0304 )dz i \u2297 dz j\u0304 ,\n\nand we use {g\u03c6ij\u0304 } to denote the inverse matrix of {gij\u0304 + \u03c6,ij\u0304 }. For simplicity,\nwe use both g and \u03c9 to denote the K\u00e4hler metric. The space of K\u00e4hler\npotentials is defined to be\n\u221a\n \u0304 > 0},\nH\u03c9 = {\u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (M )|\u03c9\u03c6 = \u03c9 + \u22121\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nwhich is identified with the space of K\u00e4hler metrics and is the main objects\nwe are interested in.\nGiven a K\u00e4hler metric \u03c9, its volume form is\n\u221a\n( \u22121)n\nn\ndet(gij\u0304 )dz 1 \u2227 dz 1\u0304 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dz n \u2227 dz n\u0304 .\n\u03c9 =\nn!\nThe Ricci curvature of \u03c9 is locally given by\nRij\u0304 = \u2212\u2202i \u2202j\u0304 log det(gkl\u0304 ),\nthe Ricci form being\nRic\u03c9 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u22121Rij\u0304 dz i dz j\u0304 = \u2212 \u22121\u2202i \u2202j\u0304 log det(gkl\u0304 ).\n\nIt is a real, closed (1,1) form. The cohomology class of the Ricci form is the\nfirst Chern class C1 (M ), and is therefore independent of the metric.\nGiven a polarized compact K\u00e4hler manifold (M, [\u03c9]), for any \u03c6 \u2208 H,\nCalabi [4], [5] introduced the Calabi functional,\nZ\nR\u03c62 \u03c9\u03c6n ,\nCa(\u03c9\u03c6 ) =\nM\n\nwhere R\u03c6 is the scalar curvature of \u03c9\u03c6 . Note that both the total volume\nZ\n\u03c9\u03c6n\nV\u03c6 =\nM\n\nand the total scalar curvature\nS\u03c6 =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nR\u03c6 \u03c9\u03c6n\n\nremain unchanged when \u03c6 varies in H\u03c9 . As a consequence, the average\nscalar curvature\nS\u03c6\nR=\nV\u03c6\nis a constant depending only on the class [\u03c9]. Usually we use the following\nmodified Calabi energy\nZ\nf\n(R\u03c6 \u2212 R)2 \u03c9\u03c6n\nCa(\u03c9\u03c6 ) =\nM\n\n4\n\n\fto replace Ca(\u03c9\u03c6 ) since they only differ by a topological constant. E. Calabi\nstudied the variational problem to minimize Ca(\u03c9\u03c6 ) in H\u03c9 . The critical\npoints turn out [5] to be either CscK or extremal K\u00e4hler metric depending\non whether the Futaki character vanishes or not. The Futaki character\nf = f\u03c6 : h(M ) \u2192 C is defined on the Lie algebra h(M ) of all holomorphic\nvector fields of M as follows,\nZ\nX(F\u03c6 )w\u03c6n ,\nf\u03c6 (X) = \u2212\nM\n\nwhere X \u2208 h and F\u03c6 is a real valued function defined by\nF\u03c6 = G\u03c6 (R\u03c6 ).\nG\u03c6 is the Hodge-Green integral operator, and F\u03c6 = G\u03c6 (R\u03c6 ) is equivalent to\n\u25b3\u03c6 F\u03c6 = R\u03c6 \u2212 R, where \u25b3\u03c6 is the Laplace operator of the metric \u03c9\u03c6 . In\n[5], E. Calabi showed that the Futaki character f = f\u03c6 is invariant when \u03c6\nvaries in H\u03c9 .\nThe existence of CscK metrics (or extremal K\u00e4hler metrics) seems intractable at the first glance since the equation is a fully nonlinear 4th order\nequation. In [4], E. Calabi proposed the so-called Calabi flow to approach\nthe existence problem. The Calabi flow is the gradient flow of the Calabi\nfunctional, defined as the following parabolic equation with respect to a real\nparameter t \u2265 0,\n\u2202\ng (t) = \u2202i \u2202j\u0304 Rg(t) .\n\u2202t ij\u0304\nOn the potential level, the Calabi flow is of the form\n\u2202\u03c6\n= R\u03c6 \u2212 R.\n\u2202t\nUnder the Calabi flow, we have\nZ\nZ\nd\n2 n\n(D\u03c6 R\u03c6 , R\u03c6 )\u03c9\u03c6n ,\n(R\u03c6 \u2212 R) \u03c9\u03c6 = \u22122\ndt M\nM\nwhere D\u03c6 is the Lichn\u00e9rowicz operator defined by\nD\u03c6 f = f,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nand where the covariant derivative is with respect to \u03c9\u03c6 . So the Calabi\nenergy is strictly decreasing along the flow unless \u03c9\u03c6 is an extremal K\u00e4hler\nor a CscK metric.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nToric geometry and Calabi flow\n\nIn this section, we use the description of toric manifolds which is due to\nGuillemin [16] [17] and Abreu [2], see also Donaldson [11] and ApostolovCalderbank-Gauduchon [3]. Given a n-dimensional polarized toric variety\nX with K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 and Hamiltonian action of an n-dimensional torus\naction Tn , we denote its moment map by \u03bc. The image of the moment map\nis a Delzant polytope P in Rn . Let X0 = \u03bc\u22121 (P0 ), where P0 is the interior\nof P ; X0 is a dense open subset of X diffeomorphic to Rn \u00d7 Tn . Also, the\npreimage of each boundary face of P corresponds to a divisor of X. A model\ncase is CP2 ; up to an appropriate normalization, the image of its moment\nmap can be taken to be the triangle in R2 with vertices (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)\nand the preimage of each facet is a projective line CP1 \u2282 CP2 .\nThe K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 restricted to X0 can be written as\n\u03c9=\n\nwhere zi = \u03bei +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22121\u03c6,ij dz i \u2227 dz j\u0304 ,\n\n\u221a\n\u22121\u03b7i , \u03bei \u2208 Rn , \u03b7i \u2208 Tn and\n\u22022\u03c6\n.\n\u2202\u03bei \u2202\u03bej\n\n\u03c6,ij =\n\nWe can write down the moment map explicitly in this case:\nx = \u03bc(z) = \u03bc(\u03be) = (\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n,...,\n).\n\u2202\u03be1\n\u2202\u03ben\n\nUsing the Legendre transformation, we obtain the symplectic potential u on\n\u2202\u03c6\nP0 : For each point x \u2208 P0 , there is a unique point \u03be \u2208 Rn such that \u2202\u03be\n= xi\ni\nand we let\nu(x) =\n\nX\n\nxi \u03bei \u2212 \u03c6(\u03be).\n\nIt is important to point out that u(x) should satisfy the Guillemin boundary conditions by Abreu [2], Donaldson [11] and Apostolov-CalderbankGauduchon [3]. Let d be the number of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional faces of P ,\nwe can describe the polytope P by a set of inequalities\nli (x) = hx, ui i \u2212 \u03bbi \u2265 0, i = 1, . . . , d;\n\nthe ui being primitive elements of the lattice Zn .\nLet\nd\n1X\nlk (x) log lk (x).\nu0 (x) =\n2\nk=1\n\nDefinition 3.1. u(x) satisfies the Guillemin boundary conditions if and\nonly if u(x) \u2212 u0 (x) is a smooth function on P0 up to the boundary and u(x)\nrestricted to each facet is smooth and strictly convex.\n6\n\n\fNext we want to write down the formula for Riemannian curvature in\nsymplectic coordinates which is due to Donaldson [11] and Abreu [1]. In\nsymplectic coordinates the metric is given by\nX\nX\ng=\nu,ij dxi dxj +\nu,ij d\u03bei d\u03bej ,\nwhere the matrix (u,ij ) is the inverse of the Hessian matrix u,ij =\nNow we define a 4-index tensor by\n\n\u22022u\n\u2202xi \u2202xj .\n\nab\nFkl\n= \u2212uab kl .\n\nWe can raise and lower indices in the usual way, using the metric uij , setting\nab\n.\nFijkl = uia ujb Fkl\n\nab\n,\nF abcd = uck udk Fkl\n\nLemma 3.2.

Since the evolution equation for \u03c6 is\n\u2202\u03c6\n= R \u2212 R = A \u2212 A,\n\u2202t\nwhere R = A is the average of scalar curvature R, Donaldson shows that\n[11],\n\u2202u\n\u2202\u03c6\n=\u2212\n= \u2212A + A.\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nIn [13], Donaldson introduces the M -condition to control the injectivity\nradius of X:\nDefinition 3.3. Let p, q be distinct points in the interior of P . Let \u03bd be\nthe unit vector pointing in the direction from p to q. We write\nV (p, q) = (\u2207\u03bd u)(q) \u2212 (\u2207\u03bd u)(p),\nwhere \u2207\u03bd denotes the derivative in the direction \u03bd. Thus V (p, q) is positive\nby the convexity condition. Let I(p, q) be the line segment\np+q\n+ t(p \u2212 q) : \u22123/2 \u2264 t \u2264 3/2}.\n2\nFor M > 0 we say that the symplectic potential u satisfies the M condition if for any p, q such that I(p, q) \u2282 P we have V (p, q) \u2264 M .\nI(p, q) = {\n\n7\n\n\fLemma 3.4. For any convex function u on a polytope P \u2282 Rn satisfying\nthe Guillemin boundary conditions, there exits a constant M such that u\nsatisfies the M -condition.\nProof. Near any boundary of P , u can be expressed as\n1\nu = (lE1 log lE1 + * * * + lEm log lEm ) + f\n2\nwhere Ei is a facet of P and lEi is the defining function for Ei . Without loss\nof generality, we only need to prove that for the function\nu\n\n:\n\nRm \u2192 R\n\nu(x1 , . . . , xm ) = x1 log x1 + * * * + xm log xm\nand for any point (x1 , . . . , xm ) where xi > 0 for all i, the difference of\nderivatives of u at (x1 , . . . , xm ) and (2x1 , . . . , 2xm ) in the direction of the\nunit vector\n(\u2212x1 , . . . , \u2212xm )\nv=p 2\nx1 + * * * + x2m\nis uniformly bounded.

For the reader's convenience, we put together\nour results with Donaldson's work.\nLemma 4.1. Suppose u satisfies the M -condition. Let I be a line segment\nin P\u0304 with mid-point p and let p\u2032 be an end point of I. Then the Riemannian\nlength of the segment pp\u2032 is at most\n1 p\n\u221a\nM |p \u2212 p\u2032 |Euc .\n2\u22121\n8\n\n\fProof. We can suppose that p\u2032 is the origin and that p is (L, 0), so |p\u2212p|Euc =\nL and the segment of the x1 -axis from 0 to 2L lies in P\u0304 . We apply the\ndefinition of the M -condition to the pair of points p, q, where q = (L/2, 0).\nThis gives\nZ\nL\n\nL/2\n\nu11 (t, 0)dt \u2264 M.\n\nThe Riemannian length of the straight line segment from q to p is\nZ L\n\u221a\nu11 (t, 0)dt\nL/2\n\nwhich is at most\np\n\nL/2\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n!1\n2\n\nu11 (t, 0)dt\n\nL/2\n\n.\n\np\nHence the Riemannian length of this segment is at most LM/2. Replacing\np by 2\u2212r p and summing over r we see that the Riemannian length of the\nsegment from 0 to p is at most\n\u221e\nX\n\u221a\n1\n( \u221a )r ,\nML\n2\nr=1\n\nfrom which the result follows.\n\nCorollary 4.2. Suppose that u satisfies the M -condition and that p is a\npoint of P . Then\n1 p\nDistg (p, \u2202P ) \u2264 \u221a\nM DistEuc (p, \u2202P ).\n2\u22121\nProof. To see this we take p\u2032 to be the point on \u2202P closest to p, in the\nEuclidean metric. If p\u2032\u2032 = 2p \u2212 p\u2032 then the segment p\u2032 p\u2032\u2032 lies in P\u0304 and we\ncan apply the lemma above.\n\nNext we derive a crucial result which relates the restriction of u to lines\nand the curvature tensor F .\nLemma 4.3.

We need a simple comparison result for Jacobi\nfields.\nLemma 4.5. Suppose \u03b3(t) \u2208 P is a geodesic parameterized by its arc length\nt \u2208 (0, a). Then for any vector \u03bd1 \u2208 Rn ,\np\n(uij )(\u03bd1 , \u03bd1 )\nsinh t\nis a decreasing function of t.\nProof. Notice that the Riemannian metric on the whole manifold is invariant\nunder the Tn action, hence we can let \u03bd1 be the Jacobi vector field along \u03b3.\nLet us fix a point t0 \u2208 (0, a); without loss of generality, we can assume \u03bd1 's\nRiemannian magnitude is 1 at \u03b3(t0 ), i.e. |\u03bd1 |2 = (uij )(\u03bd1 , \u03bd1 ) = 1. Let us\nconsider the derivative of |\u03bd1 |/ sinh t at t = t0 . We only need to show that\nh\u03bd1\u2032 , \u03bd1 i \u2264 cosh t0 / sinh t0 , where \u03bd1\u2032 = \u2207X(t0 ) \u03bd1 , X = \u2202\u03b3\n\u2202t .\nn\nLet us pick \u03bd2 , . . . , \u03bdn \u2208 R , such that |\u03bd2 | = * * * = |\u03bdn | = 1 and 0 =\nh\u03bdi , \u03bdj i = (uij )(\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ), i 6= j at \u03b3(t0 ). Assume e1 , . . . , en are orthogonal\nframe along \u03b3 such that e1 (t0 ) = \u03bd1 (t0 ), e\u20321 = 0, . . . , en (t0 ) = \u03bdn (t0 ), e\u2032n = 0.\nExpressing \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn in terms of e1 , . . . , en , we get\n\u03bdi = \u03bdi (t) = Gji (t)ej (t).\nThe Jacobi equation tells us that\n\u03bdi\u2032\u2032 + Rm(\u03bdi , X)X = 0\nLet H be a n \u00d7 n symmetric matrix such that H(ei , ej ) = Rm(ei , X, X, ej ),\nthen\nG\u2032\u2032 + GH = 0.\nLet S = G\u22121 G\u2032 , so that S satisfies the Riccati equation\nS \u2032 + S 2 = \u2212H.\nNotice that\n\u03bdi h\u03bdj , Xi = 0 = \u03bdj h\u03bdi , Xi;\nwe get\nh\u03bdj , \u2207\u03bdi Xi = h\u03bdi , \u2207\u03bdj Xi\nh\u03bdj , \u03bdi\u2032 i = h\u03bdi , \u03bdj\u2032 i\nk\n\nGkj G\u2032 i\n\nk\n\n= Gki G\u2032 j .\n\n13\n\n\fHence S(t) is a symmetric matrix for all t. At t = t0 we have h\u03bd1\u2032 , \u03bd1 i = S11 ,\nthe (1, 1) entry of the matrix S, so it suffices to prove that all the eigenvalues\nof S(t0 ) are bounded above by cosh t0 / sinh t0 . Now each eigenvalue \u03bb(t) of\nS(t) satisfies a scalar Riccati differential inequality\n\u03bb\u2032 + \u03bb2 \u2264 1.\nBy standard arguments, we may ignore the complications that might\noccur from multiple eigenvalues. Suppose by contradiction that \u03bb(t0 ) >\ncosh t0 / sinh t0 . Then we can find \u03c4 \u2208 (0, t0 ) such that \u03bb(t0 ) = cosh(t0 \u2212\n\u03c4 )/ sinh(t0 \u2212 \u03c4 ). Now the function \u03bc(t) = cosh(t \u2212 \u03c4 )/ sinh(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) satisfies\nthe equation \u03bc\u2032 + \u03bc2 = 1. So \u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bc\u2032 \u2212 \u03bc2 in the interval (\u03c4, t0 ] and\n\u03bb(t0 ) = \u03bc(t0 ). It follows that \u03bb(t) \u2265 \u03bc(t) for t \u2208 (\u03c4, t0 ) and since \u03bc(t) \u2192 \u221e\nas t tends to \u03c4 from above we obtain a contradiction.\nLemma 4.6. Let E be a face of the polytope P and suppose that the defining function \u03bbE (determined by \u03c3) is x1 . Then if u satisfies the Guillemin\nboundary conditions and |F | \u2264 1 throughout P we have\nu11 (p) \u2264 sinh2 Distg (p, E)\nfor any p in P .\nProof. To see this we consider a geodesic parameterized by t \u2265 0, starting at\ntime 0 on the boundary component E. Near the boundary we can describe\nthe geometry in terms of a 2n-manifold with a group action in the familiar\nway. The vector field \u2202\u03b8\u2202 1 is smooth in the 2n-manifold and vanishes at t = 0.\nThe condition that x1 is the normalized defining function just asserts that\nthis vector field is the generator of a circle action of period 2\u03c0. It follows\nthat\n\u2202\nlim t\u22121 |\n| \u2264 1,\nt\u21920\n\u2202\u03b81\n(with equality when\n\u221a the geodesic is orthogonal to the edge E). Then, by\nthe above lemma, u11 = | \u2202\u03b8\u2202 1 | \u2264 sinh t and the result follows.\nCorollary 4.7. Let E be a face of P with defining function \u03bbE . Then if\n|F | \u2264 1 we have\n\u03bbE (p) \u2264 cosh(Distg (p, E)) \u2212 1.\nProof. Notice that this is an affine-invariant statement. There is no loss in\nsupposing that, as above, \u03bbE = x1 . Then for a geodesic starting from a\npoint of E, parameterized by arc length, we have\n|\n\n\u221a\ndx1\n| \u2264 |dx1 |g = u11 \u2264 sinh t\ndt\n\nhence x1 \u2264 cosh t \u2212 1.\n14\n\n\fLemma 4.8. Suppose that |F | \u2264 1 and that p is a point in P with Distg (p, \u2202P ) \u2265\n\u03b1 > 0. Then if q is a point with Distg (p, q) = d we have\n(uij (q)) \u2264\n\nsinh2 (\u03b1 + d) ij\n(u (p)).\nsinh2 \u03b1\n\n(uij (q)) \u2265\n\nsinh2 (\u03b1 \u2212 d) ij\n(u (p)).\nsinh2 \u03b1\n\nIf d < \u03b1 we have\n\nProof. To prove the Lemma, observe that it suffices by affine invariance to\nprove the corresponding inequalities for the matrix entry u11 = |\u01eb1 |2 . For the\nfirst inequality we consider a minimal geodesic \u03b3 from p = \u03b3(0) to q = \u03b3(d)\nand extend it \"backwards\" to t > \u2212\u03b1. Then replacing t by t + \u03b1 we are in\nthe situation considered in Lemma 4.5 and we obtain\n|\u01eb1 (q)|\n|\u01eb1 (p)|\n\u2265\n.\nsinh \u03b1\nsinh(\u03b1 + d)\nFor the second inequality we extend the geodesic \"forwards\" to the interval\n[0, \u03b1] and argue similarly.\nSuppose that p = (p1 , . . . , pn ) is a point of P and r > 0. Put\nEp,r = {(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Rn : uij (p)(xi \u2212 pi )(xj \u2212 pj ) \u2264 r 2 }.\nSo E(p, r) is the interior of the ellipse defined by the parameter r and the\nquadratic form uij (p). The Euclidean area of E(p, r) is det(uij (p))\u22121/2 \u03c9n r n ,\nwhere \u03c9n is the volume of a standard Euclidean n-ball.\nLemma 4.9. Suppose that |F | \u2264 1 and that p is a point in P with Distg (p, \u2202P ) \u2265\n\u03b1 > 0. Then for any \u03b2 < \u03b1 the \u03b2-ball in P , with respect to the metric g\nsatisfies\nE(p, c\u03b2) \u2282 Bg (p, \u03b2) \u2282 E(p, C\u03b2),\nwhere c = sinh(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)/ sinh \u03b1 and C = sinh(\u03b1 + \u03b2)/ sinh \u03b1. In particular,\nthe Euclidean area of the \u03b2 ball for the metric g is bounded below by\nAreaEuc Bg (p, \u03b2) \u2265 cn \u03b2 n \u03c9n det(uij )(p)\u22121/2 .\nProof. There is no loss in supposing that the matrix uij (p) is the identity\nmatrix, so we have to show that the ball Bg (p, \u03b2) defined by the metric g\ncontains a Euclidean disc of radius c\u03b2, and is contained in a Euclidean disc\nof radius C\u03b2. We know by the above lemma that on the ball Bg (p, \u03b2) we\nhave\nc2 \u2264 (uij ) \u2264 C 2 .\nThus C \u22122 \u2264 (uij ) \u2264 c\u22122 , and the Euclidean length of a path in Bg (p, \u03c1) is at\nleast c\u22121 times the length calculated in the metric g, and at most C \u22121 times\n15\n\n\fthat length. The second statement immediately tells us that Bg (p, \u03b2) lies\nin E(p, C\u03b2). In the other direction, suppose q is a point in the Euclidean\ndisc of radius c\u03b2 centered on p. We claim that q lies in the (closed) g ball\nBg (p, \u03b2). For if not there is a point q \u2032 in the open line segment pq such\nthat the distance from q \u2032 to p is \u03b2 and the line segment pq \u2032 lies in Bg (p, \u03b2).\nBut the Euclidean length of this line segment is strictly less than c\u03b2 so the\nlength in the metric g is less than \u03b2, a contradiction.\n\n5\n\nSingularity Analysis\n\nBy Chen-He's result [7], the Calabi flow exists for a short time. Suppose\nthat the Calabi flow does not exist for all time and the singular time is T ,\ni.e, the Riemannian curvature blows up at time T . We will use blowing up\narguments to rule out different kinds of singularities under the Calabi flow.\ni\nSince \u2202u\n\u2202t = \u2212Ai and |\u2207A| is bounded for all t < T , we conclude that\nfor any t < T , u(t) satisfies a M -condition by Lemma 3.4. Next we want\nto show that the scalar curvature A is bounded for any finite time T . It is\nwell known that the Calabi energy, L2 -norm of A \u2212 A, is decreasing under\nthe Calabi flow. We want to see the corresponding formula in toric case. In\nfact, by the Abreu's formula, we have\nA=\u2212\nhence\n\nX \u2202 2 uij\n,\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\nij\n\ndA2\n= \u22122AE ijij ,\ndt\n\nwhere\nE ij =\nSo\nd\ndt\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nP\n\nA d\u03bc = \u22122\n\nZ\n\nZP\n\n\u2202uij\n.\n\u2202t\n\nij\n(A \u2212 A)Eij\nd\u03bc\n\nZ\n\n(A \u2212\nAj Eiij d\u03bc\n= \u22122\n+2\nP\nZ \u2202P\nAj Eiij d\u03bc\n= 2\nP\nZ\nZ\nij\nAij E ij d\u03bc\nAj E \u03bdi d\u03c3 \u2212 2\n= 2\nP\n\u2202P\nZ\nij\nAij E d\u03bc\n= \u22122\nP\nZ\nAij uia Aab ubj d\u03bc \u2264 0.\n= \u22122\nA)Eiij \u03bdj d\u03c3\n\nP\n\n16\n\n\fIn the above calculations, the integral domains in fact are P\u03b4 and \u2202P\u03b4\nwhere P\u03b4 is an interior domain whose boundary has a distance \u03b4 from the\nboundary of P and we let \u03b4 \u2192 0. The reason why all the boundary integrals\ngo to 0 relies on the Guillemin boundary condition: without loss of generality, we can set \u03bd = h1, 0, . . . , 0i, so u = x1 log x1 + f where f is a smooth\nfunction up to the boundary. Then u1j are all products of x1 with smooth\nfunctions. So E 1i = 0, Ej1j = 0 for all i and j > 1. Since the boundary\n11\nmeasure d\u03c3 is fixed, u11\n1 is fixed, hence E1 = 0.\nIf the scalar curvature is not bounded, then there is t < T and x0 \u2208 P ,\nsuch that |A(x0 , t)| > C1 . By the assumption that |\u2207A| is uniformly\nbounded at [0, t], there is a neighborhood xR0 \u2208 Q \u2282 P with V ol(Q) > C2\nand |A(x, t)| > C1 /2 for all x \u2208 Q. Then P A2 > C12 C2 /4 at time t. It\nis easy to see that we can get C1 as large as we want with C2 fixed which\ncontradicts the fact that the Calabi energy is decreasing along the Calabi\nflow.\nSince the Calabi flow cannot extend through time T > 0, the L\u221e -norm\nof Riemannian curvature of t-slice would blow up as t \u2192 T . Now pick\na sequence of points (pi , ti ) \u2192 (p, T ) where |Rm(pi , ti )| realizes the L\u221e\nRiemannian curvature norm at ti . We want to show the rescaling process in\nthe corresponding polytope. Here we follow Donaldson's work [13]. Suppose\nu is a convex function on a polytope P with uij\nij = \u2212A. Let \u03bb be a positive\nreal number. Define a function \u0169 on the polytope P\u0303 = \u03bbP by\n\u0169(x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03bbu(\u03bb\u22121 x1 , . . . , \u03bb\u22121 xn ).\nProposition 5.1 (Donaldson). \u0169 satisfies the following properties:\n\u2022 The curvature F\u0303 of \u0169 satisfies\n|F\u0303 |(\u03bbp) = \u03bb\u22121 |F |(p).\n\u2022 The scalar curvature \u00c3 = \u2212\u0169ij\nij is\n\u00c3(\u03bbp) = \u03bb\u22121 A(p).\n\u2022 If u satisfies an M -condition then so does \u0169 (with the same value of\nM ).\nProof. Using the chain rule for partial derivatives, we obtain \u0169ij kl = \u03bb\u22121 uij kl\nand hence the desired conclusion.\nDilating by a factor \u03bbi = |Rm(pi , ti )|, we get a new sequence of data\n(P\u0303 (i) , \u0169(i) ). It is clear that, perhaps after taking a subsequence, one of the\ntwo cases must occur.\n17\n\n\f\u2022 The limit of the P\u0303 (i) is the whole of Rn ;\n\u2022 The limit of the P\u0303 (i) is a (R+ )m \u00d7 Rn\u2212m with m < n.\nTo rule out those singularities, the idea is to study the equation\nX ij\n\u2212\nuij = A.\n\nDonaldson [12] rewrites the above equation in the following form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nij\n\u2212U\n= A,\ndet(ukl ) ij\n\nwhere (U ij ) is the cofactor matrix of (uij ).\nIt is easy to check that if we can show that for any compact set away\nfrom the boundary, the operator (U ij ) is uniformly elliptic, then the limit\nequation will be\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nij\n\u2212U\n=0\ndet(ukl ) ij\nin the weak sense. Thus we can use the maximal principle to obtain a\ncontradiction. To control the upper and lower bound of (uij ), we utilize\nDonaldson's idea [13].\nCase 1: The limiting domain is Rn .\nLet us normalize u(i) first. By translation we can assume that each pi is\nthe origin and u(i) is normalized at the origin, i.e, u(i) (0) = 0, \u2207(u(i) ) = 0.\nWe want to show that on any compact subset K \u2282 Rn we have upper and\nlower bounds\n(i)\n\u22121\n\u2264 \u0169ij \u2264 CK .\nCK\nThe upper bound follows immediately from Lemma 4.4 (since on compact\nsets the Euclidean distance of the boundary of P\u0303 (i) tends to infinity with\ni). Let J = J (i) be the function det(\u0169ij ). The crucial thing is to get a\nlower bound on J(0). Corollary 4.7 implies that the distance in the metric\ng\u0303 (i) corresponding to \u0169(i) from the origin to the boundary of P\u0303 (i) tends\ng (i) | is equal to 1 at the origin. Since the\nto infinity. By construction, |Rm\nderivative of Riemannian curvature is uniformly bounded, we can find a fixed\ng (i) | \u2265 1/2 on the g\u0303(i) ball of radius \u03b4 about\nsmall number \u03b4 such that |Rm\nthe origin. On the other hand Lemma 4.9 implies that this ball contains a\nEuclidean ellipse of area at least cJ(0)\u22121/2 \u03b4n , for some fixed c. Thus\nZ\ng (i) |n d\u03bcEuc \u2265 c\u03b4n J(0)\u22121/2 .\n|Rm\nP\u0303 (i)\n\nSince the Ln -norm of the Riemannian curvature is bounded and is scaling\ninvariant, the integral on the left is bounded. So we obtain a lower bound\n18\n\n\fon J(0), as required. Combined with the upper bound on \u0169ij this lower\nbound on J(0) yields an upper bound on \u0169ij at the origin. Now Lemma\n4.8 gives an upper bound on \u0169ij at points of bounded g\u0303 distance from the\norigin. The upper bound on \u0169ij implies that on compact subsets of Rn the g\u0303\ndistance to the origin is bounded. So we conclude that \u0169ij is bounded above\non compact subsets of Rn . Also \u0169ij is bounded below on compact subsets of\nRn . Once we have these upper and lower bounds on \u0169ij the convergence of a\nsubsequence is straightforward, and the limit function \u0168 satisfies \u0168 ij ij = 0.\nHowever, the following theorem tells us that it cannot happen.\nNote that Donaldson proves a stronger result in the case of n = 2 and\nTrudinger-Wang study a similar fourth order PDE in their work [22]. However, our approach is different than theirs.\nProposition 5.2. There is no convex function u satisfying the following\nconditions simultaneously: 1. uij ij = 0. 2. |F | \u2264 1. 3. |\u2207u| < M .\n1\nProof. Let G = det(u\n, then G satisfies U ij Gij = 0 where U ij is the coij )\nfactor matrix of uij . Applying Lemma 4.4, there is a constant C such that\nHess(u)(v, v) < C for any unit vector v. And for arbitrary \u01eb > 0, we know\nthat for |x| large enough,\nZ 1\nHess(u)|x+tv (v\u0304, v\u0304)dt < 2\u01eb,\n\u22121\n\nwhere v\u0304 is the unit vector at x pointing away from the origin. Using the\nsame tricks as we did in Lemma 4.4, we get\n\u0012 \u0013 !\n4\u01eb 4\u01eb 2\n.\n,\nHess(u)|x (v\u0304, v\u0304) \u2264 max\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nNow it is clear that for any \u01eb > 0, there is a R > 0, such that for any x\noutside B(0, R), | det(uij )(x)| < \u01eb. That tells us that G reaches its minimum\nin the interior of Rn . Since G satisfies U ij Gij = 0, we know that G must be\na constant; hence it must be zero, a contradiction.\nCase 2: The limiting domain is (R+ )m \u00d7 Rn\u2212m , m > 1.\nIn those cases, we still follow Donaldson's work to get the uniform ellipticity of the operator (U ij ) and use a different method to rule out the\nsingularities. We pick a point p\u0303i such that it satisfies the following two\nconditions.\n\u2022 The Euclidean distance between p\u0303i and pi is bounded and hence its Riemannian distance is also bounded by Lemma 4.1. Since the derivative\nof the Riemannian curvature is controlled, we can assume |Rm(p\u0303i )| \u2264\n1/2.\n19\n\n\f\u2022 p\u0303i is not close to the boundary in the sense of the Euclidean distance\nand hence it is not close to the boundary in the sense of the Riemannian\ndistance by Corollary 4.7.\nThe remaining process is the same as in the previous case, we normalize\n\u0169(i) at p\u0303i and there is a subsequence converging to a smooth function U\nsatisfying U ij ij = 0, |F (\u221e) |2 = U ij kl U kl ij \u2264 1 and M -condition. Notice that\nthe function f (x) = x log x satisfies f \u2032 (x/2) \u2212 f \u2032 (x) = \u2212 log 2, x > 0. Then\nfor any positive number c, there is a D > 0 such that f \u2032 (x/D) \u2212 f \u2032 (x) < \u2212c.\nBased on this observation, let us check what happens in our limiting function\nU . Without loss of generality, we can assume one edge of P is {x1 = 0} and\n{x1 > 0} \u2229 P is not empty. We want to consider the derivative of u(i) in\nthe x1 direction near the boundary x1 = 0. Since |\u2207A| is bounded, what\nreally matters is x1 log x1 . Hence for any c > 0, there is a uniform constant\nD > 0, such that\n\u2202u(i)\n\u2202u(i)\n(x1 /D, x2 , . . . , xn ) \u2212\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) < \u2212c\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x1\nfor all functions u(i) . Since we normalize \u0169(i) at p\u0303i whose Euclidean distance\nto the boundary is bounded from below, then for any positive constant c > 0,\nthere is a uniform constant d > 0 such that for every point x and for any\nj \u2264 m, if its j-th coordinate is less than d, then\n\u2202 \u0169(i)\n(x) < \u2212c.\n\u2202xj\nThe same conclusion holds for our limiting function U . In the next proposition, we will show that it is impossible.\nProposition 5.3. There is no convex function u defined on (R+ )m \u00d7 Rn\u2212m\nsatisfying the following conditions simultaneously:\n\u2022 uij ij = 0\n\u2022 |F |2 = uab cd ucd ab \u2264 1\n\u2022 u satisfies the M -condition.\n\u2022 For every positive number C > 0, there is a d > 0 such that for every\npoint x and for any i \u2264 m, if its i-th coordinate is less than d, then\n\u2202u\n< \u2212C\n\u2202xi\nProof. We will check the \u03a91 = R+ \u00d7 R \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 R case first. Let us consider\nthe Legendre dual of u, i.e, \u03c6. We have\n0 = \u03c6ij (log det(\u03c6ab ))ij\n20\n\n\fand in the coordinate system\nyi =\n\n\u2202u\n.\n\u2202xi\n\nThe corresponding region \u03a92 of \u03a91 in the yi space will be a tube, where\ny2 , . . . , yn are bounded and y1 has an upper bound but no lower bound. Let\nus pick a constant c sufficiently small such that \u03a94 = {y1 > c} \u2229 \u03a92 6= \u00f8. By\nthe fourth assumption, there is a constant d > 0 such that the preimage of\n\u03a94 will be contained in \u03a93 = \u03a91 \u2229 {x1 \u2265 d}.\nWithout loss of generality, we can pick a point \u0233 \u2208 \u03a94 such that its first\ncoordinate \u02331 > c. Let G(y) = log det(\u03c6ab )\u2212\u03bb(y1 \u2212 \u02331 ), where \u03bb is a constant\nto be determined later. The idea is that if G(y) reaches its minimum in the\ninterior of \u03a94 , the equation\n0 = \u03c6ij Gij\ntells us that in any compact set of \u03a94 , G is a constant. Hence log det(\u03c6ab ) =\n\u03bb(y1 \u2212 \u02331 ) + C on any compact set of \u03a94 . However, log det(\u03c6ab ) approaches\ninfinity at some boundaries of \u03a94 and we would get a contradiction.\nThe remaining task is to pick an appropriate \u03bb such that G(y) reaches\nit minimum in the interior of \u03a94 . Suppose y \u2208 \u2202\u03a94 and the first coordinate\nof y is strictly greater than c. We claim that G(y) is infinity in this case.\nLet us pick a sequence of points yn \u2208 \u03a94 approaching y. It is easy to see\nthat y is also in the boundary of \u2202\u03a92 , since the mapping from \u03a94 to \u03a93\nis local diffeomorphism, the corresponding xn \u2208 \u03a93 of yn must approach\ninfinity. Because the first coordinate of xn is greater than d, for any unit\nvector v, Hess(u)(v, v) is bounded from above by Lemma 4.4. And since xn\napproaches infinity, Hess(u)(v, v) approaches 0 where v is the unit vector at\nxn pointing away from (d, 0, . . . , 0). So det(uij )(xn ) approaches 0. Hence\nwe can conclude that det(\u03c6ab )(yn ) approaches infinity.\nWhat left is that the first coordinate of y is equal to c. Since det(uij )\nis bounded from above in \u03a93 , det(\u03c6ab ) is bounded from below in \u03a94 . Hence\nwe can find a \u03bb big enough such that for all such y, G(y) > G(\u0233).\nFor the other cases, they are almost the same. We let \u03a94 = \u03a92 \u2229 {y1 >\nc1 } \u2229 * * * \u2229 {ym > cm } and let G(y) = log det(\u03c6ab ) \u2212 \u03bb1 (y1 \u2212 \u02331 ) \u2212 * * * \u2212\n\u03bbm (ym \u2212 \u0233m ). Then we can show that G(y) reaches its minimum in the\ninterior of \u03a94 by picking \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm appropriately.\nBy the above arguments, we complete the proof of Theorem (1.3).\n\n21\n\n\fReferences\n[1] M.
