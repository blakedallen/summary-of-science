Among various supersymmetric models the most extensively studied is the\nminimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) [1]. Another\npopular supersymmetric model, which may be equally or\nmore attractive compared with the MSSM, is the nextto-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) [2] since it\ncan solve the \u03bc-problem and alleviate the little hierarchy. These models will soon be put to the test at the\nLHC. Thus, their phenomenological study is important\nand urgent.\nAlthough the most convincing evidence of supersymmetry is the detection of sparticle (sfermions, gauginos\nor Higgsinos) productions, the indirect probe through detecting the quantum effects of virtual sparticles in some\nmeasurable interactions will play a complementary role.\nIf the sparticles are relatively heavy (say above a few\nTeV) and hence cannot be directly detected at the LHC,\nthe indirect probe through quantum effects could be important. For this end, the Higgs boson Yukawa interactions may play a special role since they can harbor sizable quantum effects of heavy sparticles when the Higgs\nsector is not so heavy (i.e. mA is not so large). The\ndominant quantum effects of sparticles are from the supersymmetric QCD interaction and in the literature the\ncalculations have been performed in the MSSM for such\nsupersymmetric QCD effects in the Higgs boson Yukawa\ncouplings [3, 4] and the associated Higgs production processes at the LHC [5]. The studies in the decoupling\nlimit with heavy sparticles showed that for a light Higgs\nsector (mA is not large) the supersymmetric QCD can\n\nleave over large residual quantum effects in both the decay h \u2192 bb\u0304 [4] and the productions at the LHC [5]. Given\nthe popularity of the NMSSM, it is necessary to extend\nthe study to the NMSSM. This is the aim of this work.\nIn this work we will focus on the supersymmetric QCD\neffects in the hbb\u0304 coupling (h is the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson) and perform a comparative study for\nthe two popular supersymmetric models: the MSSM and\nNMSSM. Such a study is interesting for two points:\n(i) The study of the NMSSM can accommodate the\nstudy of the MSSM, and in some limit the NMSSM\nresults can reduce to the MSSM results. One can\nenvisage that the supersymmetric residual effects in\nthe MSSM can be magnified in the NMSSM. So the\nfuture measurements of such effects may be useful\nin telling the difference of the two models.\n(ii) Compared with the MSSM, the NMSSM may predict a different tree-level hbb\u0304 coupling and different\nloop contribution. In the NMSSM the mass matrix and mixings of the Higgs bosons are enriched\nand thus the components of the lightest CP-even\nHiggs boson h are different from the MSSM values. The residual supersymmetric QCD effects in\nthe NMSSM may be larger and more interesting.\nNote that supersymmetry is a decoupling theory and all\nlow-energy observables will recover their corresponding\nSM predictions when the mass scale of all supersymmetric particles (including the masses of sparticles and mA )\ntake their heavy limits. The large residual quantum effects of sparticles in the Higgs Yukawa couplings happen\nonly in case that sparticles are heavy but mA is light. If\n\n\f2\nboth sparticles and mA take their heavy limit, the residual effects of supersymmetry do vanish. Since so far such\na split scenario (with light Higgs bosons and relatively\nheavy sparticles) remains possible, we should check its\nphenomenological consequence.\nII.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n\nWe start our analysis by recapitulating the basics of\nthe NMSSM. In the NMSSM a singlet Higgs superfield \u015c\nis introduced and the Higgs terms in the superpotential\nare given by\n\u03ba\n\u03bb\u015c \u0124d * H\u02c6u \u2212 \u015c 3 ,\n3\n\n(1)\n\nA\u03ba 3\n\u03baS + h.c. .\n3\n\n(2)\n\nSo the scalar Higgs potential is given by\n`\n \u0301\nVF = |\u03bbHd * Hu \u2212 \u03baS 2 |2 + |\u03bbS|2 |Hd |2 + |Hu |2 , (3)\n \u0301\ng2 `\nVD = 2 |Hd |2 |Hu |2 \u2212 |Hd * Hu |2\n2\n \u03012\ng 2 + g22 `\n+ 1\n|Hd |2 \u2212 |Hu |2 ,\n(4)\n8\nVsoft = m2d |Hd |2 + m2u |Hu |2 + m2s |S|2\n\"\n\"\n\u03ba\n(5)\n\u2212 A\u03bb \u03bbSHd * Hu + A\u03ba S 3 + h.c. ,\n3\n\nwhere g1 and g2 are the coupling constant of UY (1) and\nSUL (2), respectively. So we can see that in the limit of\nvanishing \u03bb, \u03ba, A\u03ba and with the input of the effective\n\u03bcef f , the NMSSM can reduce to the MSSM.\nWith the vevs vu , vd and s, the scalar fields are expanded as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nvd + \u03c6d + i\u03c6d\nHd =\n,\n(6)\nHd\u2212\n\u0012\n\u0013\nHu+\nHu =\n,\n(7)\nvu + \u03c6u + i\u03c6u\nS = s + \u03c3 + i\u03be .\n\nwhere\nXb = Ab + \u03bcef f tan \u03b2 ,\n2\nML2 = MQ\u0303\n+ m2b + MZ2 (I3b \u2212 Qb s2W ) cos 2\u03b2 ,\n\nMR2 = Mb\u03032R + m2b + MZ2 Qb s2W cos 2\u03b2 .\n\nwhere \u0124u and \u0124d are the Higgs doublet superfields, and\n\u03bb and \u03ba are the dimensionless constants. Note that there\nis no explicit \u03bc-term and an effective \u03bc-parameter is generated when the scalar component (S) of \u015c develops a\nvev s: \u03bcef f = \u03bbs. The corresponding soft SUSY breaking terms are given by\n\u2212 A\u03bb \u03bbSHd * Hu \u2212\n\nIn the MSSM, h can be decomposed in the same way\nexcept that without the singlet component, U H is a 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix and can be parameterized in terms of a mixing\nangle \u03b1.\nThe sbottom squared-mass matrix in the NMSSM is\nsame as in the MSSM with \u03bc replaced by \u03bcef f . In the\nbasis of (b\u0303L ,b\u0303R ), the squared-mass matrix is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nML2 mb Xb\n2\nMb\u0303 =\n,\n(11)\nmb Xb MR2\n\n(8)\n\nThe mass eigenstates can be obtained by unitary rotations of interaction states, e.g., for the CP-even neutral\nmass eigenstates (h, H1 , H2 ) we have\n\u221a\nT\nT\n(9)\n(h, H1 , H2 ) = 2U H (\u03c6d , \u03c6u , \u03c3) .\nSo the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson h is composed by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nH\nH\nH\nh = U11\n2\u03c6d + U12\n2\u03c6u + U13\n2\u03c3.\n(10)\n\n(12)\n\nwith sW \u2261 sin \u03b8W , tan \u03b2 = vu /vd , I3b and Qb being respectively the isospin and electric charge of the b-quark,\nMQ\u0303 and Mb\u0303R being the soft breaking masses, and Ab\nbeing the soft breaking trilinear coupling. The sbottom\nmass eigenstates (b\u03031 , b\u03032 ) are obtained by the unitary rotation of the interaction eigenstates:\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nb\u03031\ncos \u03b8b\u0303 \u2212 sin \u03b8b\u0303\nb\u03031\nb\u0303L\n(13)\n=\n= ZD\nsin\n\u03b8\ncos\n\u03b8\nb\u03032\nb\u03032\nb\u0303R\nb\u0303\nb\u0303\nwhere the unitary matrix ZD parameterized by a mixing\nangle \u03b8b\u0303 diagonalizes the mass matrix in Eq.(11).\nThe coupling of sbottoms with the singlet component\n\u03c3 of the Higgs boson h comes from the F-term of the\nsuperpotential, given by\n\u221a\ng 2 mb\n\u2212\n\u03bbvu 2\u03c3 b\u0303\u2217L b\u0303R + h.c. .\n(14)\n2mW cos \u03b2\nIn terms of the mass eigenstates of sbottoms, the vertex\nhb\u0303i b\u0303j takes the form\nVhb\u0303i b\u0303j = \u2212i\n\n\"\n\"\ng2 mb\nH ij\nH ij\nH ij\nU11\ncd + U12\ncu + U13\ncs (15)\n2mW cos \u03b2\n\nwhere cij\ns is only for the NMSSM (or equivalently set\nH\nij\nU13\n= 0 for the MSSM), while cij\nd and cu are present for\nboth models.

To study the decoupling limit of SUSY particles, we assume all the soft breaking mass parameters\n\n(MQ\u0303 ,Mb\u0303R ,mg\u0303 ,Ab ) and the parameter \u03bcef f are degenerate, which are collectively denoted by MSUSY . Then\nin the MSSM the SUSY parameters are (MSUSY , MA ,\ntan \u03b2), while in the NMSSM there are three additional\nparameters (\u03bb, \u03ba, A\u03ba ). In our calculations we scan over\nthese three additional parameters in the ranges\n\u2212 0.5 < \u03bb, \u03ba < 0.5, \u2212 500 GeV < A\u03ba < 500 GeV (23)\nNote here we did not consider a large \u03bb or \u03ba. Theoretically, the requirement of perturbativity up to some\ncut-off scale will set upper bounds on \u03bb and \u03ba at weak\nscale (if the cut-off scale is chosen to be the GUT scale,\na stringent bound \u03bb2 + \u03ba2 <\n\u223c 0.5 is obtained [6]). Phenomenologically, a large \u03bb or \u03ba will incur stringent constraints from current experiments (see the last reference\nin [2]).\nBefore displaying the numerical results, we make some\nclarifications regarding to our numerical calculations:\n(1) In our calculations we used the package NMSSMTools [10] which considered the loop corrections (especially the stop/sbottom loops) to the effective potential, the masses and mixing angles of the Higgs\nbosons. These corrections are important and cannot be ignored.\n(2) Since we used the package NMSSMTools in which\nthe Higgs mass matrices are diagonalized numerically, we did not use any approximate unitary\ntransformation for our calculation.\n(3) For the b-quark mass mb , in the package NMSSMTools (and thus in our calculation), it is taken as\nthe running mass mb (Q) (we take Q = MSUSY ),\nwhich means that the sizable QCD loop effects\nare taken into account. Actually, although both\n0\nthe tree-level coupling Vhb\nand the one-loop SUSY\nb\u0304\nQCD contributions \u03b4Vhbb\u0304 are proportional to mb\nand thus very sensitive to the value of mb , the rela0\ntive correction effects \u03b4Vhbb\u0304 /Vhb\n(displayed in our\nb\u0304\nnumerical results) are not so sensitive to the value\nof mb .\nNow we present some numerical results. To see the general feature of the corrections, we first switch off the experimental constraints on the parameter space and in\nFigs.2 and 3 display the resluts of the relative correction\neffects\n\u2206SQCD \u2261\n\n\u03b4Vhbb\u0304\n= \u2206v + \u2206ct .\n0\nVhb\nb\u0304\n\n(24)\n\nWe see that for a light mA the SUSY QCD with a large\nMSUSY can leave over sizable effects in the coupling hbb\u0304.\nBut as mA gets heavy, such residual effects of SUSY QCD\nbecome small in magnitude, showing the decoupling behavior of supersymmetry. Compared with the MSSM\nresults, the effects in the NMSSM can vary in a much\nbroader region. While the corrections are always negative in the MSSM, in the NMSSM the corrections can be\nboth negative and positive.\n\n\f4\n0.1\n\nTABLE I: Some sample points in the parameter space of the\nNMSSM, in which the SUSY QCD loop effects \u2206SQCD can\nbe of very different size.

We see that for the SUSY QCD loop effects on\nthe hbb\u0304 coupling to be sizable in the NMSSM, the ratio\nH\nH\nH\nH\nU12\n/U11\n( U12\nand U11\nare respectively the components\nof \u03c6u and \u03c6d in h, as defined in Eq.10) plays the key role\nfor the following reasons. As shown in Eq.(24), \u2206SQCD\nis composed of two parts: the counter-term part \u2206ct and\nthe vertex-loop part \u2206v . We found that in most of the\nparameter space allowed by the LEP constraints, \u2206ct is\nnegative and dominant in size, which is independent of\nhow h is composed of. Whereas, \u2206v is positive and cancel \u2206ct to some extent. The size of \u2206v can be enhanced\nH\nH\nby the ratio U12\n/U11\n, as shown in Eq.(21). Although the\n\nH\nH\nH\nH\nA\u03ba MSU SY U12\n/U11\nU13\n/U11\nmh \u2206SQCD\n(%)\n446 1788\n16.2\n-0.023 117.4\n-4.1\n333 1575\n14.7\n0.042 116.3\n-6.0\n393 1145\n14.8\n-0.046 114.7\n-6.1\n460 1568\n14.1\n-0.062 116.1\n-6.8\n-294 1544\n10.1\n0.118 114.8 -12.0\n-175 1831\n9.7\n-0.100 115.2 -12.4\n-426 1738\n7.3\n-0.069 114.8 -15.5\n-377 1401\n5.4\n0.024 115.3 -18.0\n-324 1419\n4.1\n-0.017 114.9 -19.7\n-304\n623\n0.5\n0.002\n99.4 -24.5\n\nH\nH\nratio U13\n/U11\ncan also enhance the size of \u2206v , its effect\nH\nis suppressed by the smallness of U13\nand \u03bb in cij\ns (in our\nH\nscan we found that both \u03bb and U13 are small in order\nto satisfy the LEP constraints encoded in the NMSSMH\nH\nTools). Therefore, as U12\n/U11\ngets large, \u2206v becomes\nmore sizable and, due to its cancellation effect, the total\ncorrection effects become less sizable. Note that although\nthe value of mh is below 114 GeV for some points, these\npoints can still satisfy the LEP constraints encoded in\nthe NMSSMTools because the LEP bound on the MSSM\nmh is 92 GeV (see Fig.2 in the paper by Barger et. al. in\nRef.[2]). By the way, some comprehensive studies on the\nphenomenology of the NMSSM Higgs sector (which may\nbe quite different from the phenomenology of the MSSM\nHiggs sector) have been performed in Ref.[2], where all\nthe Higgs couplings and all the decay modes as well as\nproductions have been intensively studied.\nFrom Table I we see that although \u03bb is scanned in the\nrange of \u22120.5 \u223c 0.5, only small values of \u03bb (\u223c 0.1 in\nmagnitude) survived the LEP constraints encoded in the\nNMSSMTools. As \u03bb gets large, the mixing between singlet and doublet Higgs fields becomes large (although the\nmixing is not totally determined by \u03bb and other parameters are also contributing) and, consequently, is more\nconstrained by LEP experiments [2]. Such a small \u03bb, together with other NMSSM parameters appearing in the\nmass matrix of the Higgs fields, leads to a small mixing\nbetween singlet and doublet Higgs fields. As shown in\nH\nTable I, the singlet component U13\nin h is small, which\nmeans that the lightest Higgs boson h is not the singletlike one and instead it is doublet-dominant (MSSM-like).\nFor the hbb\u0304 coupling with such a MSSM-like h, the\nNMSSM can still allow for quite different SUSY QCD\neffects compared with the MSSM predictions. The reason is that, as discussed above, the SUSY QCD effects\nH\nH\n/U11\n, which is different in\nare sensitive to the ratio U12\n\n\f5\nthese two models (even for a small \u03bb, the NMSSM can\nH\nH\nstill allow for different-size components U12\nand U11\nin h\nbecause other NMSSM parameters are also contributing\nto the mass matrix and mixings of the Higgs fields).\nWhen we switch on the comprehensive experimental\nconstraints encoded in the NMSSMTools [10], we obtain\nthe results of \u2206SQCD displayed in Fig.4. These experimental constraints are comprehensive, including the LEP\nII searches for the Higgs boson, various B-decays and the\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g \u2212 2).\n\nstraint from the muon g \u2212 2 data shown in Fig.4 comes\nfrom our simple assumption that all soft masses (in the\nsquark sector, the slepton sector and the gaugino sector)\nare degenerate. Of course, the muon g \u2212 2 constraint is\nnot necessary; without such an assumption of degeneracy,\nthe constraint is lifted.\nSince the SUSY QCD residual effects can be over 20%\nfor the hbb\u0304 coupling and thus over 40% for the ratio of\nthe branching fractions (SUSY QCD does not contribute\nto h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 at one-loop level)\n\n0\n\nRb/\u03c4 =\n\n(25)\n\nfuture measurements at the LHC or ILC may unravel\nsuch supersymmetric effects. This ratio Rb/\u03c4 is proposed\nin [13] as a probe to new physics. To measure this ratio\nat the LHC, one may count the event numbers of the production of hbb\u0304 followed respectively by the decay h \u2192 bb\u0304\nand h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , and the ratio of these two event-numbers\ncan be a measure of Rb/\u03c4 (the difference of efficiency for\nb-tagging and \u03c4 -tagging should be taken into account).\nFinally, we make some remarks regarding to our results:\n\n-0.05\n\n\u2206SQCD\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.25\n\nmA = 100 GeV\n-0.3\n\nBr(h \u2192 bb\u0304)\n,\nBr(h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nMSUSY (GeV)\nFIG. 4: Same as Fig. 3, but for mA = 100 GeV in the\nNMSSM. The dark-shaded region denoted by '\u00d7' (red in\ncolor) are allowed by the experimental constraints considered\nin the NMSSMTools [10]. The light-shaded region denoted\nby '\u2022' (yellow in color) are excluded by LEP experiment or B\nphysics, and the medium-shaded region denoted by '+' (skyblue in color) are excluded by the muon g \u2212 2.\n\nFrom Fig.4 we see that in the special scenario under\nour consideration (all soft breaking mass parameters are\ndegenerate), MSUSY is constrained in a certain range.\nThe range of MSUSY <\n\u223c 600 GeV is not allowed by LEP\nexperiments, while MSUSY >\n\u223c 1 TeV cannot explain the\nmuon g \u2212 2 data (we require the supersymmetric effects\n= (29.5 \u00b1\nto account for the deviation of aexp\n\u2212 aSM\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u221210\n8.8) \u00d7 10\nat 2\u03c3 level). In the allowed region of the\nparameter space, the SUSY QCD corrections to the hbb\u0304\ncoupling can still be significant, over 20% in magnitude.\nIf we switch off the muon g \u2212 2 constraint ( the hadronic\ncontribution to aSM\nis not so certain [12]), the allowed\n\u03bc\nparameter space gets much broader, as shown in Fig.4. In\nour study we did not require supersymmetry to explain\nvarious plausible evidences of dark matter.\nNote that the SUSY contributions to the muon g\u22122 are\nsensitive to the soft masses in slepton sector and chargino\nsector, but not dependent on the squark or gluino mass\ninvolved in our SUSY QCD loops. The stringent con-\n\n(1) We only investigated the SUSY QCD corrections,\nwhich is O(\u03b1s ) and thus should be the most important among the SUSY corrections. Among\nthe SUSY electroweak corrections, the Higgs-top\nm2\nYukawa corrections, which are O(\u03b1 m2t ), may also\nW\nbe sizable although they are seemingly not as large\nas the O(\u03b1s ) SUSY QCD corrections. With the\nconsideration of the SUSY electroweak corrections,\nour conclusion will remain qualatively unchanged.\n(2) Since our main interest is the residual effects\nof heavy sparticles, we assumed all soft SUSYbreaking mass parameters are equal to MSUSY .\nThis is a very strong simplifying assumption. If\nwe lift such an assumption and consider the multiple free soft parameters, we will obtain the results which numerically are different to some extent while qualitatively exhibit the same feature,\ni.e., the NMSSM allows broader corrections than\nthe MSSM, because the NMSSM parameters can\ncomplicate the mass matrix and mixings of Higgs\nfields.\n(3) We should stress again that supersymmetry is a\ndecoupling theory and the large residual quantum\neffects of sparticles in the Higgs Yukawa couplings\nare present only in case of a light mA . If both\nMSUSY and mA take their heavy limit, the SUSY\neffects will vanish. Such a decoupling behavior is\nsimilar in the NMSSM and MSSM, as shown in\nFig.2.\n\n\f6\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe focused on the SUSY QCD effects in the hbb\u0304 coupling and performed a comparative study for the two\npopular SUSY models: the MSSM and NMSSM. We\nfound that for both models the SUSY QCD can leave\nover large residual quantum effects in hbb\u0304 coupling if\nthe sparticles are relatively heavy (a few TeV) while the\nHiggs sector is not so heavy (mA is not so large). Compared with the MSSM results, the NMSSM can allow\nfor a much broader region of such residual effects. Since\nthese residual effects can be over 20% in magnitude, fu-\n\n[1] For a review, see, e.g., H. E. Haber, G. L. Kane, Phys.\nRept. 117, 75 (1985).\n[2] See, e.g., J. R. Ellis, et. al., Phys. Rev.
