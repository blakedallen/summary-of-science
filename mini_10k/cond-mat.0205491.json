Wise\nDepartment of Applied Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA\n(Dated: May 23, 2002)\nIn our recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 65, 075316 (2002)], the selection rules for the Raman scattering\nin spherical nanocrystals are analyzed. Here we show, that a physically expedient choice of the\ncoordinate system, related to the polarization vector of the incoming or scattered light, simplifies\nand clarifies the analysis.\n\nIn the paper1 , multiphonon Raman scattering in semiconductor nanocrystals is investigated. In that work, we have\nconsidered two groups of selection rules: (i) for active exciton states and (ii) for participating phonons. Within the\ndipole approximation, the physically expedient choice implies that the axis Oz is parallel to one of the polarization\nvectors, either eI of the linearly polarized incoming light or eS of the linearly polarized scattered light. The selection\nrules on p. 5 of the paper1 correspond just to this choice of the axis Oz. We keep one and the same coordinate system\nwhen describing both exciton and phonon states throughout the paper1 .\nThe selection rules for participating phonons can be expressed in terms of the vector addition of angular moments.\nLet us denote LI(S) \u2261 1 the angular momentum of the incoming (scattered) light, and l the angular momentum of\na phonon. The corresponding z-projections (for an arbitrary coordinate system) are MI(S) and m, respectively. The\nrules for the angular-momentum addition are\n\u001a\n|l \u2212 1| 6 1,\n(1)\nMI = MS + m.\nHerefrom, we obtain the selection rules for the phonon angular momentum and for its z-projection\nl 6 2,\nm = MI \u2212 MS .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nEq. (2) means, in particular, that only s-, p- and d- phonons may participate in the one-phonon Raman scattering.\nThe selection rule (3) is just the conservation law for the z-projection of the angular momentum.\nLet us \u0001consider the case when Oz k eI , so that MI = 0. For the Raman scattering in the parallel polarizations\nS\ne k Oz , MS = 0, and, according to Eq. (3), only the scattering with the participation of phonons with m = 0 is\nallowed. Otherwise, when one considers the same Raman scattering in the parallel polarizations choosing Ox k eI k eS ,\nthe projections of the angular moments for both incoming and scattered photons on the axis Oz do not take definite\nvalues, because photon states in this case are superpositions of the states with MI(S) = 1 and MI(S) = \u22121. For this\ncoordinate system, following Eq. (3), phonons with m = 0, \u00b12 can participate in the one-phonon Raman scattering.\nThis result is in agreement with the statement of Ref.2 , that in parallel polarizations, phonons with m 6= 0 can\nparticipate in the Raman scattering when the axis Oz does not coincide with the light polarization vectors. However,\nin this case, the choice of the axis Oz is not physically expedient.\nFor the scattering in the crossed\n\u0001 polarizations, let us consider one of the aforesaid physically expedient coordinate\nsystems with Oz k eI , Ox k eS . In this system, MI = 0, while the scattered light is a superposition of states with\nMS = \u00b11. Consequently, the selection rule (3) takes the form m = \u00b11. It is worth noting, that for any coordinate\nsystem with Oz k eI or Oz k eS , we obtain the same selection\nrule m = \u00b11 for the crossed polarizations.\n\u0001\nFor the other coordinate system Ox k eI , Oy k eS , described in the comment2 , the photon angular momentum\nprojections are: MI = \u00b11, MS = \u00b11. As a result, m can take the values m = 0, \u00b12. It is worth mentioning, that\nwhen one chooses Ox k eI k eS for the parallel polarizations and Ox k eI , Oy k eS for the crossed polarizations,\nthe selection rule (3) leads to the same allowed values of m for the parallel and crossed polarizations, what makes a\ndistinction between these two scattering configurations less clear.\nIn summary, in different coordinate systems the selection rule (3) for the participating phonons (as well as the\nselection rules for the active exciton states) can formally distinguish just because a rotation of the axis Oz can lead\n\n\f2\nto superpositions of states with different values of m in a new coordinate system. As shown above, the choice of the\ncoordinate system in the paper1 is physically opportune. When a coordinate system is chosen in another way, the\ncontent of scattering can be masked, though it describes the same physical processes.\n\n*\n\nPermanent address: Department of Theoretical Physics, State University of Moldova, str.
