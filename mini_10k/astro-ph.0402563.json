Based on the morphologies and energetics we\ncan deduce physical processes taking place at the inner center of the regions. Several singledish studies agree on the results that massive molecular outflows are ubiquitous phenomena\nin massive star formation and that they are far more massive and energetic than their lowmass counterparts (e.g., Shepherd & Churchwell 1996b; Ridge & Moore 2001; Zhang et al.\n2001; Beuther et al. 2002c).\nA point these studies disagree on is the degree of collimation of massive outflows. Based\non early studies by Shepherd & Churchwell (1996a) and its follow-ups, it was believed that\nhigh-mass outflows tend to be less collimated than low-mass flows. As the outflow collimation is theoretically tightly connected with the accretion process, these studies favored\nthe idea that massive stars might form via different physical processes, e.g., the coalescence\nof intermediate-mass protostars at the very center of dense evolving cluster (Bonnell et al.\n1998; Stahler et al. 2000; Bally 2002).\nHowever, recent observations by Beuther et al. (2002c) show that the previously claimed\nlower collimation of massive outflows is mostly an observational artifact caused by the larger\ndistances of the target sources (on the average a few kpc) and too low spatial resolution of\nmost studies. Their data taken with the IRAM 30 m telescope at a spatial resolution of 11\u2032\u2032\nare consistent with massive, bipolar outflows as collimated as their low-mass counterparts.\nThis implies that massive stars can form in a qualitatively similar manner as low-mass stars,\njust with accretion rates increased by orders of magnitude.\nThese latter observations are still based on single-dish observations, and to substantiate\nthe scenario a statistically significant number of high-spatial-resolution interferometer studies\nof massive molecular outflows is necessary. As a first step in that direction Beuther et al.\n(2002a) have observed the massive star-forming region IRAS 05358+3543 with the Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer (PdBI) in CO(1\u20130), SiO(2\u20131) and H13 CO+ (1\u20130). They observed a\nmassive outflow from the central object of the evolving cluster which is jet-like and highly\ncollimated with a collimation degree of 10. This is the upper end of collimation degrees\nobserved for low-mass outflows as well (Richer et al. 2000). In addition to that collimated\njet-like structure, they observed at least two more outflows within the same region. In\nanother source, IRAS 19410+2336, the two outflows observed at single-dish resolution split\nup at least into 7 separate outflows when observed with interferometers (Beuther et al.\n2003). Similar results were observed toward G35.2 by Gibb et al. (2003). One of the main\nconclusions of these studies is that massive star-forming regions can appear confusing with\nsingle-dish instruments, but that it is possible to disentangle the structures with high enough\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nspatial resolution into features well known from low-mass star formation.\nContrary, other high-spatial-resolution studies of high-mass star-forming regions indicate that massive outflows can also appear morphologically and energetically different\nto their low-mass counterparts (e.g., Shepherd et al. 1998, 2003). As the high-spatialresolution results are still based on poor statistical grounds, we pursued massive outflow studies with the PdBI1 . Here we present the results of two more regions \u2013 IRAS 19217+1651 and\nIRAS 20293+3952 \u2013 observed at an angular resolution as high as 1.8\u2032\u2032 in CO(2\u20131) and SiO(2\u2013\n1). The two sources are part of a large and well studied sample of 69 high-mass protostellar\nobjects at early evolutionary stages prior to producing significant ultracompact Hii (UCHii)\nregions (Sridharan et al. 2002; Beuther et al. 2002b,c,d). The two sources were chosen because\nthey combine different features of massive star formation: IRAS 19217+1651 has a luminosity\nof 104.9 L\u2299 and shows a rather simple morphology with one mm continuum source associated with cm emission and H2 O and class II CH3 OH masers. Contrary, IRAS 20293+3952\ncontains a small UCHii region, contributing most of the bolometric luminosity (103.8 L\u2299 ,\nSridharan et al. 2002), and likely a cluster of younger intermediate-mass sources triggering the molecular outflows. While the single-dish outflow map of IRAS 19217+1651 shows a\nwell-defined bipolar morphology, already the single-dish data of IRAS 20293+3952 show that\nwe are dealing with multiple outflows in that region (Beuther et al. 2002c). Both sources\ncover a wide range of characteristics from intermediate- to high-mass star formation, the\nmain source parameters are listed in Table 1.\nAfter describing the observations in \u00a72, we present the observational results for both\nsources separately in \u00a73. Then we discuss the results in the framework of massive star\nformation and include literature data with special regard to the position-velocity structure\nof massive outflows in \u00a74. Finally, \u00a75 draws the conclusions, summarizes the current stage\nof massive molecular outflow studies, and outlines main topics to be tackled in the coming\nyears.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations\n\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI)\n\nWe observed IRAS 19217+1632 and IRAS 20293+3952 in different runs from November\n1999 to February 2002 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at 1.3 mm and at 3 mm in\nthe C and D configurations with 4 antennas in 1999 and 5 antennas in 2002. The 1 mm\n1\n\nIRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nreceivers were tuned to the CO(2\u20131) line at 230.5 GHz, and the 3 mm receivers covered the\nSiO(2\u20131) line at 86.85 GHz.\nThe typical system temperatures at 1.3 mm are about 300 K and at 3 mm about 135 K.\nThe phase noise was mostly below 20\u25e6 and always below 30\u25e6 . After smoothing the data,\nthe final velocity resolution in both lines is 1 km s\u22121 , adequate to sample the broad wing\nemission of the outflows. Atmospheric phase correction based on the 1.3 mm total power\nwas applied. For continuum measurements, we placed two 320 MHz correlator units in each\nband to cover the largest possible bandwidths. The primary beam at 1.3 mm is 22\u2032\u2032 , and\nto cover both regions completely mosaics were necessary. In IRAS 19217+1651 the mosaic\nconsisted of 5 fields (offsets [\u2032\u2032 ]: 19/33, 12/24, 6/14, 0/4, -5/-6) and in IRAS 20293+3952\nof 8 fields (offsets [\u2032\u2032 ]: 24/10, 12/7, 2/4, -10/1, 36/15, 32/3, 32/-9 32/-20) with respect to\nthe phase reference centers listed in Table 1. The somewhat peculiar V-shaped mosaic for\nIRAS 20293+3952 was chosen based on the previous single-dish observations (Beuther et al.\n2002c). Temporal fluctuations of the amplitude and phase were calibrated with frequent\nobservations of the quasars 1923+210, 2032+107 and 2013+370. The amplitude scale was\nderived from measurements of MWC349 and 3C345, and we estimate the final flux density\naccuracy to be \u223c 15%. Synthesized beams at the different wavelengths are listed in Table 2.\n\n2.2.\n\nShort spacings with the IRAM 30 m telescope\n\nTo account for the missing short spacings and to recover the line-flux, we also observed\nthe source in CO(2\u20131) at 11\u2032\u2032 resolution with the IRAM 30 m telescope in Summer 2002.\nThe observations were done remotely from the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie\n(MPIfR) Bonn in the on-the-fly mode. Typical system temperatures at 1.3 mm were around\n\u03bb\n400 K, the data were sampled in 4\u2032\u2032 increments (Nyquist sampling is 2D\n\u223c 4.5\u2032\u2032 ) and the\nvelocity resolution was 0.1 km s\u22121 .\nThe algorithm to derive visibilities from the single-dish data corresponding to each pointing center is described by Gueth et al. (1996). The single-dish and interferometer visibilities\nare subsequently processed together. Relative weighting has been chosen to minimize the\nnegative side-lobes in the resulting dirty beam while keeping the highest angular resolution\npossible. Images were produced using natural weighting, then a CLEAN-based deconvolution of the mosaic was performed. Synthesized beams of the merged data are listed in Table\n2.\nIt should be noted that only the CO(2\u20131) data have been complemented by short spacing\ndata from the 30 m telescope whereas we did not get these data at 3 mm. Nevertheless, at\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3 mm the short-spacings problem is less severe because the interferometer samples larger\nregions at lower frequencies.\n\n3.\n\nObservational results\n\nFor both sources we detect bipolar outflows in CO(2\u20131) and SiO(2\u20131) (Figs. 2 & 4).\nWhile IRAS 19217+1651 is dominated by one extremely energetic outflow, IRAS 20293+3952\nexhibits one collimated jet-like outflow and at least three more outflows. Before discussing\ntheir implications for massive star formation we present each star-forming region separately.\n\n3.1.\n\nIRAS 19217+1651\n\n3.1.1. Millimeter Continuum\nEven at the highest spatial resolution of \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 the mm continuum emission of IRAS 19217+1651\nremains single-peaked and does not split up into multiple sub-sources (Fig. 1). The millimeter continuum fluxes are given in Table 3. Comparing the 1.3 mm flux obtained with the\nPdBI and the 1.2 mm single-dish fluxes (Beuther et al. 2002b) we estimate that about 80%\nof the total continuum flux is filtered out by the interferometer. Compact cm continuum\nemission and 22 GHz H2 O and 6.7 GHz Class II CH3 OH maser emission observed with the\nVLA and ATCA (Sridharan et al. 2002; Beuther et al. 2002d) peak at the mm continuum\nsource 2 . It has to be taken into account that IRAS19217+1651 is five times further away\nthan IRAS 20293+3952, and thus we cannot resolve as much structure. Nevertheless, the\nspatial coincidence of mm/cm continuum emission and the two maser species suggests that\nthe region is dominated by one massive evolving protostar at the cluster center.\nAssuming optically thin dust emission at mm wavelength, we calculate the mass and\npeak column density using the 1.3 mm data following the procedure outlined for the singledish dust continuum data by Beuther et al. (2002b). Recent studies indicate that the dust\nopacity index \u03b2 could be lower than the canonical value 2 at the core centers of massive starforming regions (Goldsmith et al. 1997 and references therein; Beuther et al. 2004b,a; Kumar\net al. 2003). Unfortunately, we cannot properly differentiate between the dust and free-free\ncontributions in the mm regime toward IRAS 19217+1615, and thus not derive \u03b2 explicitly\n2\n\nBeuther et al. (2002d) presented a similar image with the cm source and one H2 O maser feature being\n\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 offset to the east. Unfortunately, the astrometry in their image was wrong, here we present the correct\npositions.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nfor this source. Based on the other studies we set \u03b2 to 1. We use a dust temperature of 38 K\nas derived by SED fits to the IRAS data (Sridharan et al. 2002). As discussed by Beuther\net al. (2002b), the errors of the estimated masses and column densities are dominated by\nsystematics like the exact knowledge of \u03b2 or the temperature. For example, reducing \u03b2 from\nthe canonical value of 2 to 1 lowers the estimated mass by about one order of magnitude.\nWe estimate the masses and column densities to be correct within a factor 5-10. The total\ngas mass of the central core observed at 1.3 mm with the PdBI is around 220 M\u2299 , and the\npeak column density of the order a few times 1023 cm\u22122 corresponds to a visual extinction\nAv = NH /2 \u00d7 1021 \u223c 600 (Table 3).\n\n3.1.2. The molecular outflow\nFigure 2 presents the merged PdBI+30m CO(2\u20131) outflow image obtained for IRAS 19217+1651.\nWe observe a bipolar outflow emanating from the mm core with the main blue emission to\nthe south-west and the main red emission to the north-east. The gas with the highest velocities (\u00b130 km s\u22121 ) is located at the core center, however we find high velocity gas offset from\nthe core as well (see below, Figure 8). The overall collimation of the outflow is pretty high\nwith a collimation degree \u223c 3 (length of the outflow divided by its width). The morphology\nof the blue outflow wing resembles a cone-like structure. The red wing to the north-east\nshows an elongated feature with a P.A. of 40\u25e6 with respect to the main outflow axis. The\nmorphology of the red wing is quite different compared with the blue wing, and one can\nget the impression that in this area might be a second outflow in the north. However, the\nmass contained in the red wing is very high (\u223c 50 M\u2299 , Table 4), and it is difficult to imagine\nsuch a massive and energetic outflow without a mm continuum source as the counterpart\n(the 3\u03c3 rms of 7.5 mJy corresponds to a mass sensitivity of 4.3 M\u2299 ). Therefore, we conclude\nthat the red and blue wing emission is part of the same outflow emanating from the massive mm core. The different morphologies to the north and south are likely attributed to\nenvironmental differences.\nThe SiO(2\u20131) emission shown in Figure 2 exhibits a similar outflow morphology as the\nCO observations but missing the broad lower intensity outflow emission depicted in CO. As\nSiO is mainly a shock tracer (Schilke et al. 1997) it is likely that SiO is not excited in the\nouter regions of the outflow. However, it should be mentioned that this difference might\nalso be an observational artifact because we do not have the short spacings data for SiO\nand thus the larger scale SiO outflow emission could be filtered out by the interferometer.\nFurthermore, due to the larger primary beam of the PdBI at 3 mm compared to 1 mm (59\u2032\u2032\nand 22\u2032\u2032 , respectively) we observe a larger field in SiO and detect an additional bipolar\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nstructure in the west not covered by the CO data. We do not detect a mm continuum\nsource there (the 3 mm continuum covers the same field). Nevertheless, it is likely that a\nmm continuum source is simply too weak and not detected due to insufficient signal to noise.\nAdopting the same assumptions outlined in \u00a73.1.1 for the 3 mm continuum data, the 3\u03c3 rms\nof 2.4 mJy corresponds to a mass sensitivity of \u223c 30 M\u2299 .\n\n3.2.\n\nIRAS 20293+3952\n\n3.2.1. Millimeter Continuum\nFigure 3 presents the mm continuum data for IRAS 20293+3952 and additionally the\ncm and H2 O maser emission in that region. Obviously, the overall picture is different from\nIRAS 19217+1651. We find three mm continuum sources with an H2 O maser associated\nwith the strongest of them. Furthermore, offset from the mm emission there is a resolved\ncm source indicating a more evolved UCHii region. We do not detect any mm continuum\nemission at the position of the UCHii region down to the 3\u03c3 rms sensitivity limit of 13.5 mJy,\ncorresponding to a mass sensitivity of 0.2 M\u2299 assuming optically thin dust emission. Instead\nof one source dominating the whole region (\u00a73.1.1) IRAS 20293+3952 exhibits four sources\npossibly interacting with each other. Comparing the interferometric and single-dish fluxes\n(Beuther et al. 2002c), nearly 90% of the total flux is filtered out in IRAS 20293+3952, even\nmore than in IRAS 19217+1651.\nAssuming optically thin dust emission with a dust temperature of 56 K (Sridharan et al.\n2002) using again the dust opacity index \u03b2 = 1 (\u00a73.1.1) we derive masses and column\ndensities for the three mm clumps. The masses of each clump listed in Table 3 are about\ntwo orders of magnitude below the value derived for IRAS 19217+1651 whereas the beam\naveraged column densities are of the same order, only lower by factors of 2-6.\nThe clump masses between 1 and 3 M\u2299 appear low regarding the overall luminosity of\nthe region of 103.8 L\u2299 . However, the luminosity is measured with the large IRAS beam and\nthus comprises also the nearby UCHii region. Assuming the cm emission to be optically thin,\nSridharan et al. (2002) estimated the stellar luminosity of its central source to be close to the\ninfrared-derived value. Therefore, while it is possible that we partly underestimate the mass\nof the dust cores in IRAS 20293+3952, it seems obvious that the dominant luminosity source\nis the UCHii region. The mm sources nearby, which trigger all the spectacular outflows,\nform a kind of secondary cluster of intermediate-mass sources.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.2.2. Four molecular outflows\nAs the millimeter continuum, the outflow emission in IRAS 20293+3952 is more complex than in IRAS 19217+1651 as well. The CO velocity spread down to zero intensity\nwith \u2206v \u223c 92 km s\u22121 in IRAS 20293+3952 is also larger compared to \u2206v \u223c 64 km s\u22121 in\nIRAS 19217+1651. Figure 4 shows three images of the CO red and blue outflow emission\n(extreme outflow velocities, moderate outflow velocities, and all outflow velocities), it also\nsketches the four outflows identified in that region. Figure 5 shows the SiO(2\u20131) emission of\nthe region. As the region is complex not all identifications are unambiguous and some features can belong to one or the other outflow, or even outflows which we do not identify yet.\nOur outflow identifications are based on the CO and SiO morphology and the assumption\nthat there are no other outflow-powering sources than mm1 to mm3.\nOutflow (A): The most prominent feature in Figure 4 is the collimated jet-like outflow\nemanating from mm1 in south-west\u2013north-eastern direction. Especially interesting is the red\nwing with its extreme collimation extending about 1 pc in length. The collimation degree\nof this red wing is \u223c 8 as high as known values for the most collimated low-mass outflows\n(Richer et al. 2000). Figure 6 shows a close-up of moderate and extreme velocities for\nthe red emission stressing that the higher-velocity gas is more collimated than the lowervelocity gas. The ratio of the projected width perpendicular to the outflow direction of the\nmoderate-velocity gas versus the extreme-velocity gas is \u2265 2. This morphology resembles the\nobservations of low-mass outflows (Bachiller 1996). It is unlikely that the moderate-velocity\ngas is strongly confused by the ambient gas because the chosen velocity interval [13,25] km s\u22121\nfor the moderate-velocity component is still significantly offset from the velocity of rest\nvLSR = 6.5 km s\u22121 . Furthermore, Figure 8 presents a position velocity diagram of outflow\n(A), and we find high-velocity gas at the outflow center as well as at the very end of the\nred wing. The morphology of the blue wing is less clear which might be partly due to the\nsmaller extend of the mosaic in that direction (\u00a72). The blue feature highlighted with the\ndashed arrow in Fig. 4 could be part of a larger cone of the blue wing of (A), but it is also\npossible that there is another outflow consisting of this blue feature and maybe the northern\nred feature we so far associate with outflow (D).\nOutflow (B): A second outflow emanates from mm1 in south-eastern direction. The\nblue CO emission is only observed at a distance of \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 but SiO is observed right to mm1.\nWhile the blue emission is strong we do not observe red emission to the north. Partly, this\nshould be due to the small extend of the PdBI mosaic in that direction (\u00a72).\nOutflow (C): We observe a third small outflow emanating from mm3 in east-west direction.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nOutflow (D): The fourth outflow (D) likely emanates from mm2 and is more or less\nparallel to outflow B. Again, we see strong blue emission toward the south-east but less red\nemission toward the north-west. As already mentioned in the context of outflow (A), the red\nfeature in the north could also be part of still another outflow emanating from mm1 with\nthe blue counterpart shown in dashed contours.\nShocked H2 emission: Additionally interesting is a comparison of the outflow data with\nshocked H2 emission at 2.12 \u03bcm. The near-infrared H2 data were taken with the Omega\nPrime camera on the Calar Alto telescope within the observations of a large sample of\nmassive star-forming regions, the basic data reduction is described in a separate paper by\nStanke et al. (in prep.). Figure 7 presents an overlay of the H2 emission with the CO outflow\ndata and the cm source outlining the UCHii region. We can distinguish a few regions of\nprominent H2 emission: first, we find H2 features associated with the blue CO emission\nof outflows (A) and (B). Furthermore, we clearly identify ring-like H2 emission around the\nUCHii region. Judging from the morphology, the red CO outflow (A) bends partly around\nthat ring-like structure. In addition, there are strong H2 emission knots between mm2 and\nmm3 which could be associated with outflows (C) and (D), but which may also be part of\nthe ring-like H2 emission.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMolecular outflows\n\n4.1.1. Masses and energetics\nThe CO(2\u20131) data allow to estimate the masses and energetics of the different outflows\nin both sources. However, for IRAS 20293+3952 it is not always clear whether emission\nbelongs to one or the other outflow. For example, the emission right at the center of mm1\ncan be part of the outflows (A) as well as (B). Most likely, both outflows contribute to\nthe observed emission. Similarly, the emission between mm2 and mm3 could be part of\nthe outflows (C) and (D). In the following calculations these regions of overlap are always\nattributed to both contributing outflows.\nWe calculate opacity-corrected H2 column densities in both outflows following the approach outlined in Beuther et al. (2002c). The average temperature in the outflows is set\nto 30 K and the average line opacity in the outflow wings to \u03c4 (13 CO 2 \u2212 1) = 0.1 (based\non observations by Choi et al. 1993). According to Cabrit & Bertout (1990) derived masses\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nare accurate to a factor 2 to 4, whereas the accuracy of dynamical parameters are lower, at\nabout a factor 10. The derived masses and energetic parameters for the outflows in both\nsources are presented in Table 4.\nA comparison of the outflow mass Mout = 75 M\u2299 in IRAS 19217+1651 with the singledish observations derived value of 108 M\u2299 (Beuther et al. 2002c) shows that both values\nagree within 25%. This gives confidence that the merging process of the PdBI data with\nthe single-dish observations worked reasonably well and we recovered most of the outflow\nemission. Such a comparison is more difficult for IRAS 20293+3952 because the single-dish\ndata did not resolve the multiple outflows.\nThe values presented in Table 4 confirm that IRAS 19217+1651 powers a very massive\nand energetic molecular outflow on pc scales. The derived outflow rate \u1e40out is of the order\n10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Under the assumption of momentum driven outflows this leads to an estimate\nof the accretion rate of the order a few times 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (for details on the assumptions\nsee Beuther et al. 2002c). Accretion rates of that order are high enough to overcome the\nradiation pressure of a forming star and build the most massive stars via accretion processes\n(e.g., Norberg & Maeder 2000; McKee & Tan 2003).\nThe outflow parameters for IRAS 20293+3952 are all about one order of magnitude\nbelow the values for IRAS 19217+1651. They are higher than typical masses and energetics\nin the low-mass regime (Richer et al. 2000) but below often observed parameters for massive\noutflows (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996a; Ridge & Moore 2001; Beuther et al. 2002c; Gibb\net al. 2003). The outflows emanate from a cluster of intermediate-mass protostars right\nin the vicinity of a more evolved UCHii region. The data show that the UCHii region\nis too evolved to trigger any collimated outflow. Thus, although most of the bolometric\nluminosity stems from the UCHii region, nearly all the mechanical force Fm and mechanical\nluminosity Lm (Table 4) is due to the outflows from the intermediate-mass cluster. Based on\nthe outflow rate \u1e40out we can again estimate accretion rates between 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nright between typical values for low- and high-mass star-forming regions.\n\n4.1.2. Dynamical interactions in IRAS 20293+3952\nThe presence of four molecular outflows emanating from three mm continuum sources,\nand one UCHii region within less than 1 pc projected on the plane of the sky reveals multiple\nregions of interaction. Obviously, the CO and SiO emission around the mm sources is caused\nby different interacting molecular outflows, but the UCHii seems to affect the outflows as\nwell. Assuming that the ring-like shocked H2 emission is caused by the star powering the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncentral UCHii region, its sphere of influence extends as far as outflow (A) and the mm\nsources mm2 and mm3. The H2 emission between mm2 and mm3 might thus not be just\ndue to the outflows (C) and (D) but there may also be contributions from the UCHii region.\nWith the data so far, we cannot unambiguously conclude whether the spatial association of\nmm2 and mm3 with the H2 ring is simple coincidence or whether the formation of mm2 and\nmm3 might even be associated with some triggering mechanism from the UCHii region.\nEven more intriguing is the spatial bending of the red wing of outflow (A) right north of\nthe UCHii region. Figure 7 shows that this bending follows largely the ring-like H2 feature\nin that region. This could be just due to projection effects, but it is also possible that an\nexpanding pressure wave from the UCHii region intercepts with outflow (A) and pushes its\ngas slightly to the north. The radius of the H2 shell is about 7.7\u2032\u2032 corresponding to 15000 AU\nat a distance of 2 kpc.\n\n4.2.\n\nPosition-velocity diagrams of massive outflows\n\nPosition-velocity (p-v) diagrams are often used as a tool to understand the driving\nmechanisms of outflows (e.g., Smith et al. 1997; Downes & Ray 1999; Lee et al. 2001, 2002).\nIn addition to p-v diagrams of outflows presented in this paper, Figure 8 shows p-v diagrams of two other massive outflow sources taken from the same initial source sample:\nIRAS 23033+5951 observed in CO(1\u20130) with BIMA by Wyrowski et al. (in prep.) and\nIRAS 20126+4104 observed in CO(2\u20131) with the IRAM 30 m by Lebron et al. (in prep.).\nFor details on the outflow characteristics, we refer to the corresponding papers, here we are\nonly interested in their p-v diagrams.\nThe range of outflow masses for these four outflows is broad, from intermediate masses in\nIRAS 20293 to very high masses in IRAS 23033 (Mout = 119 M\u2299 , Wyrowski et al., in prep.).\nThe bolometric luminosities also vary by orders of magnitude: outflow (A) in IRAS 20293 is\ndriven by an intermediate-mass protostar, and the bolometric luminosities of IRAS 20126,\nIRAS 23033 and IRAS 19217 are 103.9 , 104.0 and 104.9 L\u2299 , respectively. Admittedly, the\nstatistical number of presented outflows is low, but nevertheless we cover a broad range of\nluminosities and masses and can compare these data with theories and previous studies in\nthe low-mass regime.\nWe observe mainly two features in the p-v space: first of all, high-velocity gas is detected\nat the outflow centers in IRAS 19217 and IRAS 20293. There is some high-velocity gas in\nIRAS 23033 near the center as well, but the red and blue is shifted spatially to the other\nside of the outflow center compared with the larger scale flow, thus this high-velocity gas\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmight be due to a second outflow spatially just barely resolved (Wyrowski et al., in prep.).\nIRAS 20126 does not show any high-velocity gas near the outflow center. Secondly, we\nobserve high-velocity gas at some distances from the core center: IRAS 23033 exhibits the\nso-called Hubble-law in the blue wing, i.e., a velocity increase with distance from the core\ncenter. In IRAS 20293, the velocity also increases gradually with distance in the red wing,\nand the emission feature at the very end of the collimated outflow shows emission at all\nvelocities again. In IRAS 20126, we see a gradual velocity increase and then decrease again\nwith distance from the core center, this is the only source where the p-v diagram is rather\nsymmetric. IRAS 19217 shows some high-velocity features at distances from the center as\nwell, but there is no real symmetry with respect to the core center.\nWe compare our data with high-spatial-resolution observations of low-mass outflows by\nLee et al. (2000, 2002). They observed 10 low-mass sources and found mainly two kinematic\nfeatures in the p-v diagrams: parabolic structures originating at the driving source and\nconvex spur structures with high-velocity gas near H2 bow shocks. While the parabolic\nstructures can be explained by wind-driven models the spur structures are attributed to\njet-driven bow-shock models (Lee et al. 2000, 2001, 2002). While some outflows show clear\nsignatures of one or the other model, there are also a few sources which exhibit signatures\nof both. Lee et al. (2002) propose that a combination of a jet- and wind-driven model might\nexplain all features in a more consistent way. In their first published sample, they see nearly\nno central high-velocity gas (Lee et al. 2000), whereas in later published sources some central\nhigh-velocity gas is observable (Lee et al. 2002). High-velocity features at the core centers\nare likely due to jets but they can also be mimicked by highly inclined winds (Fig. 10, Lee\net al. 2001).\nTransferring the low-mass and simulation results to our data, we find clear spur and\nHubble-law jet-signatures in IRAS 20293 and IRAS 23033, whereas IRAS 20126 can be explained by a wind-driven model (e.g., compare with RNO 91, Fig. 10, in Lee et al. 2000).\nIRAS 19217 is a less clear-cut case because we find the jet-indicating high-velocity gas at the\ncore center but also features further outside which resemble more the parabolic structures\nindicative of wind-driven models. Morphologically, the IRAS 19217 outflow is also somewhat intermediate between a collimate jet-like outflow and cavity-like features indicative\nrather of a wind (Figure 2). Likely, both mechanisms contribute to the observed outflow in\nIRAS 19217.\nTo summarize, our intermediate- to high-mass outflow data show kinematic signatures\nwhich can be explained by jet- and/or wind-driven models. We do not find any striking\ndifference to low-mass position-velocity diagrams. Similar to their low-mass counterparts,\nno single model is yet capable to explain all observations consistently.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe presented analysis of high-spatial-resolution observations of intermediate- to highmass molecular outflows indicates that the outflow morphologies/kinematics and thus their\ndriving mechanisms do not vary significantly compared to their low-mass counterparts. The\nhigher the source luminosity the more energetic the outflows, but the qualitative signatures\nare similar. These observations indicate that similar driving mechanisms can be responsible\nfor outflows of all masses.\nWe find an extremely collimated jet-like outflow emanating from the intermediate-mass\nsource mm1 in IRAS 20293+3952. This outflow shows the highest degree of collimation\nat highest velocities and slightly lower collimation at lower velocities, similar to low-mass\nsources (Bachiller 1996). The whole region IRAS 20293+3952 shows many signs of dynamical interactions, not only between the different outflows (at least four) but there are also\nindications of a shock wave from the nearby UCHii region interacting with the collimated\noutflow. While the UCHii region is the main source of luminosity in IRAS 20293, most of\nthe mechanical force stems from the outflows of the intermediate-mass sources.\nThe high-mass source IRAS 19217+1651 shows a nice bipolar outflow, slightly less collimated than the outflow (A) in IRAS 20293, but still comparable to many low-mass flows.\nThis region is strongly dominated by the central core which exhibits mm/cm continuum\nemission as well as H2 O and CH3 OH maser emission.\nPosition-velocity diagrams of molecular outflows from intermediate to high masses show\nsimilar signatures as known for low-mass outflows. Some sources are better explained by jetdriven outflows whereas others seem to be due rather to wind-driven outflows. IRAS 19217\nexhibits signatures of both. The proposal from Lee et al. (2002) that a combination of both\ndriving mechanisms can explain all outflows consistently also holds for our sample.\nEstimated accretion rates are of the order a few times 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the intermediatemass sources in IRAS 20293 and a few times 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the high-mass source IRAS 19217,\nconsistent with models forming stars of all masses via accretion (e.g, Norberg & Maeder 2000;\nMcKee & Tan 2003).\nThe data presented in this paper further support the idea that massive stars form\nvia similar accretion-based processes as their low-mass counterparts. The main difference\nappears to be their clustered mode of formation and increasing accretion rates and energetics\nwith increasing stellar mass and luminosity. However, investigations of the most massive stars\nis just beginning, and studies like this one so far rarely exceeded sources with luminosities\n> 105 L\u2299 . This is to a large degree due to the fact that there simply do not exist many sources\nwith far higher luminosity which are in a state of evolution prior or at the very beginning to\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nform a significant UCHii region. Therefore, on the one hand we have to extend massive star\nformation research significantly to even higher luminosities to confirm the present results or\nto identify possible differences in that regime. On the other hand, the constrains set on the\nmassive star-forming processes are yet mostly indirect, e.g., observing molecular outflows on\nlarge scales and inferring the processes likely taking place at the cluster centers. As the spatial\nresolution and sensitivity of (sub-)mm interferometers increase steadily, it is now necessary\nto really study the cluster centers and try to resolve the relevant processes in more direct\nways. For example, massive disk which are crucial to explain the observed outflows need to\nbe properly identified, resolved and studied to manifest its physical conditions. Furthermore,\nthe strong radiation of the massive protostars significantly changes the chemistry of those\ncentral regions. The broad bandwidth and high spatial resolution of current and future\n(sub-)mm interferometers (SMA, PdBI, CARMA, and further on ALMA) will shed light on\nmany such processes.\nWe like to say thank you very much to Thomas Stanke, Friedrich Wyrowski and Mayra\nLebron for providing the H2 data and two of the p-v diagrams prior to publication.

The thick contours show the 3.6 cm continuum\nemission. The symbols point at the maser as labeled in the top right. The large and small\nbeams at the bottom right are from the 3 mm and 1.3 mm observations, respectively. The\nmm data are contoured from 20 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak emission (Table 3).\nThe cm observations are contoured from 30 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak emission of\n19.6 mJy/beam.\n\nFig. 2.- CO(2\u20131) (left panel) and SiO(2\u20131) (right panel) observations of IRAS 19217+1632:\nThe grey scale with thick contours presents the 1.3 mm continuum emission contoured from\n15 to 95% (10% steps) from the peak emission (Table 3). Full and dotted contours show\nthe red and blue shifted emission in both species, respectively. The velocity ranges for the\nCO(2\u20131) data are: blue v=[-35,-3] km s\u22121 and red v=[9,29] km s\u22121 . For SiO(2\u20131) the velocity\nranges are: blue v=[-12,-1] km s\u22121 and red v=[6,15] km s\u22121 . The CO and SiO beams are\nshown at the bottom left of each panel, respectively. Contour levels of the line emission\nare always from 10 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak intensities (Speak blue (CO(2 \u2212 1)) =\n50.8 Jy/beam, Speak red (CO(2 \u2212 1)) = 39.1 Jy/beam, Speak blue (SiO(2 \u2212 1)) = 1.3 Jy/beam,\nSpeak red (SiO(2 \u2212 1)) = 1.1 Jy/beam). The line in the left panel sketches the axis of the p-v\ndiagram presented in Figure 8.\nFig. 3.- Continuum emission in IRAS 20293+3952: the different features are marked at\nthe top right of each panel. At the bottom left, we present the 1.3 mm and 3 mm beams,\nrespectively. The mm data are contoured from 10 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak emission\n(Table 3). The cm observations are contoured from 40 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak\nemission of 0.8 mJy/beam.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- CO(2\u20131) emission in 20293+3952 (PdBI+PV): the full and dotted/grey scale contours show the\nred- and blue-shifted emission, respectively. The velocity ranges are: (a) blue [-40,-11] kms, red [25,52] km s\u22121 ;\n(b) blue [-10,0] km s\u22121 , red [13,25] km s\u22121 ; (c) blue [-40,0] kms, red [13,52] km s\u22121 . The 1.3 mm beam is shown\nat the bottom right of each panel, the three stars and the square mark the positions of the mm sources and\nthe UCHii region, respectively. The arrows and letters sketch the four outflows discussed in the main body.\nContour levels are always from 10 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak intensities (Speak blue ext (CO(2 \u2212\n1)) = 10.0 Jy/beam, Speak red ext (CO(2 \u2212 1)) = 19.9 Jy/beam, Speak blue mod (CO(2 \u2212 1)) = 29.7 Jy/beam,\nSpeak red mod (CO(2\u22121)) = 13.0 Jy/beam, Speak blue all (CO(2\u22121)) = 34.5 Jy/beam, Speak red all (CO(2\u22121)) =\n33.8 Jy/beam).\n\nFig. 5.- SiO(2\u20131) in IRAS 20293+3952: the full and dotted contours show the red- and blueshifted emission, respectively. The 3 mm SiO beam is presented at the bottom left, the three\nstars and the square mark the positions of the mm sources and the UCHii region, respectively.\nThe arrows and letters sketch the four outflows discussed in the main body. Contour levels\nare always from 5 to 95% (10% steps) from the peak intensities (Speak blue (SiO(2 \u2212 1)) =\n2.5 Jy/beam, Speak red (SiO(2 \u2212 1)) = 4.9 Jy/beam).\n\nFig. 6.- Red CO(2\u20131) emission in IRAS 20293+3952: the grey-scale shows the moderate\nvelocities ([13,25] km s\u22121 ) and the contours present the high-velocity gas ([25,52] km s\u22121 ).\nThe 1.3 mm beam is shown at the bottom left, the three stars and the square mark the\npositions of the mm sources and the UCHii region, respectively. Contour levels are always\nfrom 10 to 90% (10% steps) from the peak intensities as presented in Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 7.- The grey-scale presents the H2 emission (Stanke et al., in prep.). The thick and\nthin black contours outline the red and blue CO emission, respectively. The white contours\npresent the 3.6 cm VLA observations of the UCHii region, and the three stars mark the\npositions of the mm sources. The contouring is the same as in the previous images.\n\nFig.\n8.- Position-velocity diagrams of the outflows in IRAS 19217+1632 and\nIRAS 20293+3952 (outflow A) presented in this paper. Furthermore we show two positionvelocity diagrams taken from the literature: IRAS 23033+5951 (observed with BIMA,\nWyrowski et al., in prep.) and IRAS 20126+4104 (observed with the IRAM 30 m, Lebron et\nal., in prep.). The horizontal lines mark the centers of the outflows which always correspond\nto the main mm continuum sources.
