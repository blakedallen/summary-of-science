Introduction\nPresently it is well accepted by the scientific community that the evolution of the\nUniverse started with an exponential accelerated expansion dominated by an entity\ncalled inflaton, followed by a decelerated period dominated by matter fields and that\npresently the Universe has entered into a new accelerated period governed by a dark\nenergy field.\nThe search for models that could explain satisfactorily the inflationary period as\nwell as the present accelerated expansion is object of intense interest of the researchers in\ncosmology. Models which explains the accelerated expansion of the Universe are based\non scalar (see e.g. [1]) or fermion (see e.g. [2]) fields that are minimally or non-minimally\ncoupled to the gravitational field and which can simulate the inflaton in the primordial\nera and the dark energy in the present period.\nWithin the context of scalar fields the models with tachyon fields minimally coupled\nto the gravitational field received a considerable attention of the researchers. The\ntachyon field has its roots in string theory, but it can be introduced in a simple\nmanner as a generalization of the\nq Lagrangian density of a relativistic particle, i.e.,\n\u221a\n2\nL = \u2212m 1 \u2212 q\u0307 \u2192 L\u03c6 = \u2212V (\u03c6) 1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6, in the same way that the quintessence\ncould be considered as a generalization of the Lagrangian density for a non-relativistic\nparticle, namely, L = q\u0307 2 /2\u2212V (q) \u2192 L\u03c6 = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6/2\u2212V (\u03c6). In this work it is discussed\nthe role of the tachyon field within a cosmological framework and the search for any\nrelationship of the tachyon field to its root in string theory is not considered.\nIn the references [3] the inflationary period of the Universe was investigated by using\ntachyon fields minimally coupled to the gravitational field for different self interaction\npotential densities, in the form of power law, exponential and hyperbolic functions of\nthe tachyon field. Tachyon fields with such kinds of potential densities were also used\nin order to describe the present acceleration period of the Universe in the references [4]\nwhere the tachyon field behaves as dark energy. Furthermore, in the work [5] it was also\nstudied a tachyon field with an exponential potential density which can play the role\nof the inflaton and dark energy. Although in the majority of those papers the tachyon\nfield is minimally coupled to the gravitational field, in reference [6] it was investigated\na non-minimally coupled tachyon field with potential densities and coupling functions\ngiven by power law functions.\nIn all the above quoted works the potential densities were proposed in a ad-hoc\nway, with the aim the determination of desired cosmological solutions. The objective of\nthe present work is to analyze a generic model for a homogeneous and isotropic Universe\nwhose gravitational sources are a matter field and a tachyon field non-minimally coupled\nto the gravitational field. The present model appears interesting because it can describe\nin a reasonable way what is observed, since via Noether symmetry approach we can find\na unique form for the potential and coupling which describe the inflationary and the\ndecelerated-accelerated period. The forms of the potential density and coupling function\nare determined from the Noether's symmetry applied to the Lagrangian density which\n\n\f3\n\nConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n\ndescribes the model. Thus, in this paper Noether's symmetry approach works as a\ncriterion for the selection of the couplings and potentials instead of proposing their\nforms by an ad-hoc way. By this proceeding we can restrict the possibilities of choice\nfor the functions partially fixing the potentials and couplings. Moreover, the existence\nof this symmetry guarantees conserved quantities, which provide a motion constant that\ncan help to integrate the field equations. Constraining scalar fields by Noether symmetry\nis a subject of several papers in the literature (see e.g. [7]). In a recent paper [8] the\nauthors applied Noether symmetry for a fermion field non-minimally coupled with the\ngravitational field.\nThe evolution equations of the Universe follows from Einstein's field equations\nand Klein-Gordon equation for the coupled tachyon field which are solved for a given\npotential density and coupling function obtained from Noether symmetry. It is shown\nthat a non-minimally coupled tachyon field could play the role of the inflaton describing\nthe exponential accelerated expansion in the early Universe and it could behaves as dark\nenergy describing the decelerated-accelerated transition period of the late Universe.\nThe organization of the work is the following: in the second section Einstein and\nKlein-Gordon equations are derived from a point-like Lagrangian obtained from the\naction for a non-minimally coupled tachyon field and for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric. The purpose of the third section is the determination from Noether symmetry of\nthe possible forms of the self-interaction potential density and of the coupling function.\nThe search of a inflationary cosmological solution is the subject of the fourth section\nwhereas in the fifth section the decelerated-accelerated transition period is analyzed.\nFinal remarks and conclusions in section sixth close this work.

Moreover, it was supposed that \u0227 and\n\u03c6\u0307 do not vanish during the time evolution of the Universe described by this model and\nthat the restriction \u03c6\u03072 6= 1 holds. Observe that the simplifications related to a \u2013 which\nwere done to obtain the equations (12) - (16) \u2013 are possible because it was considered\nthat a 6= 0.\nThe analysis of the system of equations (12) through (16) proceeds as follows. First,\nfrom equations (14)2 and (14)3 one infers that \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b20 must be constant. Next, from\nequation (14)1 two cases must be considered, namely, dF/d\u03c6 = 0 and dF/d\u03c6 6= 0.\nThe equation (16) cannot be satisfied simultaneously with the rest of the system for\nthe case dF/d\u03c6 6= 0. When we take the case dF/d\u03c6 = 0, the system is solved if F = 0,\nwhich excludes the gravitational field from the action (1). This means that if the Noether\nsymmetry must be satisfied the case k 6= 0 is ruled out. But when one considers k = 0 \u2013\na flat Universe \u2013 for the point-like Lagrangian (3) the condition Lx L = 0 furnishes the\nsystem (12) - (16) without the equation (16) and the system can present an interesting\nsolution. Hence, the following analysis will be done for a homogeneous, isotropic and\nspatially flat Universe and it will be considered in all remaining equations that k = 0.\n\n\fConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n\n6\n\nBelow the two cases (dF/d\u03c6 6= 0 and dF/d\u03c6 = 0) will be examined separately for the\nunique permitted situation by the Noether symmetry i.e., for k = 0.\n(a) First case dF/d\u03c6 = 0\nFrom the system of equations (12) and (13) it follows that \u03b1 do not depend on \u03c6\n\u221a\nand is proportional to 1/ a. Further one concludes that the only possibility to fulfill\nequation (15) is by taking V = 0. This case is not interesting because the energy density\nand the pressure of tachyon field vanish identically.\n(b) Second case dF/d\u03c6 6= 0\nFor dF/d\u03c6 6= 0 it follows from (14)1 that \u03b1 is only a function of a and the only\npossibility for equation (15) to be satisfied is that\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 a\n\nand\n\nV = \u03bb exp(\u2212\u03be\u03c6),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b10 , \u03bb and \u03be = 3\u03b10 /\u03b20 are constants. Finally, from the system of equations (12)\nand (13) one can get that the coupling function reads\nF = \u03b3 exp(\u2212\u03be\u03c6),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is another constant.\nThe constant of motion associated with the Noether symmetry is\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u03a30 = \u03b1\n+\u03b2\n,\n\u2202 \u0227\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0307\nwhich for the symmetry found leads to\n\u03a30\n=\u2212\n6\u03b3\u03b20\n\n\"\n\n!\n\n#\n\n\u03be\n\u03ba\n\u03be2\n\u221a\n\u03c6\u0307 + H a3 exp(\u2212\u03be\u03c6),\n+\n2\n3\n3\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03ba = \u03bb/6\u03b3. This is the form of the constant of motion associated with the Noether\nsymmetry which was found for the dynamics described by the general action (1). Such\na constant of motion is a new conserved quantity which does not have any relation to\nsome known a priori quantity.\nNote that the non-interacting and pressureless matter field is proportional to a3\nand it appears as a constant in the point-like Lagrangian (3). Furthermore, it does not\nhave any influence on the equations (11)-(14) which result from the symmetry condition.\nThen the constant of motion associated with the symmetry is the same for the cases\nwith and without a matter field.\n4. Inflationary period\nIn the inflationary period the role played by a matter field is negligible, so that one can\nrid of it by letting \u03c10m = 0. In this case one has to solve the system of coupled differential\nequations that follow from equations (4) and (8), namely,\nq\n\u03be\n\u03c6\u0308\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 \u03be = 0,\n+\n3H\n\u03c6\u0307\n+\n(\n\u1e22\n+\n2H\n)\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n= 0,\nH 2 \u2212 \u03beH \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 \u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\n\fConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n\n7\n\nby using equations (6), (17) and (18).\nFor the determination of an analytical solution of the coupled system of differential\nequations (21) and (22) one makes use of the constant of motion associated with Noether\nsymmetry (20), which after differentiation with respect to \u03c6 becomes an ordinary\ndifferential equation for \u03c6 that can be written as\nv\nu\n\n!\n\nu\n\u03ba\n3\n\u03c6\u03072\n3\u03ba\nt\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u00b1\n+\n+\n4\n\u03be 2 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 2\n\u03be 2 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072\n\n!\n\n= 0,\n\n(23)\n\nthanks to (22) and \u2202H/\u2202\u03c6 = 0.\nBy considering \u03be = \u2212\u0131\u03be0 , where \u03be0 is a real constant, the solution of the differential\nequation (23) is given by\n\u03c6(t) = \u0131(k1 t + k2 ),\n\n(24)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are real constants. This solution implies the following relationships for\nthe constants\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03ba=\n=\n6\u03b3\n18\n\n\u03be0\nk1\n\n!2 q\n\n\u0012\n\n1 + k12 1 +\n\n\u0013\n\nq\n\n1 + 18k12 + 9k14 + 9k12 .\n\n(25)\n\nNow the substitution of the time evolution of the tachyon field (24) into the\nexpressions for the potential density (17) and coupling (18) leads to\nV (t) = \u03bb exp[\u2212\u03be0 (k1 t + k2 )],\n\nF (t) = \u03b3 exp[\u2212\u03be0 (k1 t + k2 )],\n\n(26)\n\nrespectively. By requiring that the potential density must decay with time, one infers\nfrom equation (26)1 that \u03be0 k1 > 0.\nFinally, one can obtain from equation (22) through integration the time evolution\nof the cosmic scale factor, namely,\na(t) = exp[K(t \u2212 t0 )],\n\nwhere K =\n\nv\nu\nu\nuq\nt\n\n\u03ba\n\n(1 + k12 )\n\n+\n\n\u03be02 k12 \u03be0 k1\n+\n.\n4\n2\n\n(27)\n\nHence, this solution describes an inflationary period, where the cosmic scale factor\nincreases exponentially with time.\nThe time evolution of the energy density and pressure of the tachyon field can be\nobtained from equations (6), (7), (24) and (26), yielding\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03bb\n\n+ 6\u03be0 \u03b3k1 K \uf8f8 exp [\u2212\u03be0 (k1 t + k2 )] ,\n\u03c1\u03c6 (t) = \uf8ed q\n2\n1 + k1\nq\n\n\u03bb 1 + k12 + 2\u03be0 \u03b3k1 (2K \u2212 \u03be0 k1 )\np\u03c6 (t) = \u2212\n\u03c1\u03c6 (t).\n\u221a \u03bb 2 + 6\u03be0 \u03b3k1 K\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\n1+k1\n\nFrom the above equations one concludes that (i) the pressure is proportional to energy\ndensity and is negative and (ii) the inflationary period comes to an end at a finite time\nsince the energy density and pressure of the tachyon field tend to zero after that time.\n\n\f8\n\nConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n5.

In the above equations the prime denotes the derivative with respect to\nthe red-shift z.\nThe search for exact solutions of the coupled system of differential equations (31)\nand (32) is a very hard job and a numerical solution of the system of equations will be\nanalyzed afterwards.\nFor the determination of numerical solutions of the system of differential equations\n(31) and (32) one has to specify initial conditions for \u03c6(z), \u03c6\u2032 (z) and H(z) at present\ntime, i.e., at z = 0. As usual the energy densities are replaced by the density parameters\n\u03a9\u03c6 (z) = \u03c1\u03c6 (z)/\u03c1(z) and \u03a9m (z) = \u03c1m (z)/\u03c1(z) where \u03c1(z) = \u03c1\u03c6 (z) + \u03c1m (z) is the total\nenergy density of the sources of the gravitational\nfield. Furthermore,\none introduces\nthe\nq\nq\nq\ndimensionless quantities H\u2217 (z) = H(z)/ \u03c1(0), \u03c6\u2217 (z) = \u03c1(0)\u03c6(z), \u03be\u2217 = \u03be/ \u03c1(0) and\n\u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb/\u03c1(0). Here the present values of the energy densities adopted are \u03a9\u03c6 (0) = 0.72\nand \u03a9m (0) = 0.28 (see e.g. reference [9]).\nOne expects that the present value of the coupling is F = c3 /16\u03c0G or F = 1/2\nin natural units. Hence, it follows from (18) that \u03c6\u2217 (0) = ln(2\u03b3)1/\u03be\u2217 . Besides, since\nin the late time the Universe is accelerating, the negative pressure of the tachyon\nfield must be the responsible for its acceleration. To guarantee this behavior one\nimposes the condition \u03c6\u03072 (0) \u226a 1. It follows from equation (8) that \u03c1\u03c6 (0) \u2248 V (0),\nso that \u03c6\u2217 (0) = ln(\u03bb\u2217 /0.72)1/\u03be\u2217 , which together with the previous expression leads to\nthe relationship \u03b3 = \u03bb\u2217 /1.44.\n\n\f9\n\nConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n1\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9m\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.6\nq\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.05\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.10\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.20\n\u039bCDM\n\n-0.2\n\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.05\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.10\n\u03be\u2217 = 0.20\n\u039bCDM\n\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n\n1\nz\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-0.6\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nz\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.

To find the numerical solutions of the system of differential\nequations it was chosen \u03bb\u2217 = 1 and three values for the parameter which is related with\nthe strength of the coupling, namely, \u03be\u2217 = 0.05; 0.10; 0.20. Furthermore, the desired\nconditions at z = 0 \u2013 by taking into account that \u03c6\u03072 (0) \u226a 1 \u2013 are\nH\u2217 (0) =\n\nq\n\n1/3,\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (0) = \u2212 ln(0.72)1/\u03be\u2217 ,\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u2217 (0) = 10\u22123.\n\n(36)\n\nIn the left frame of figure 1 the density parameters of the matter and tachyon fields\nare plotted as a function of the red-shift in the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2. One observes from\nthis figure that the coupling parameter \u03be\u2217 has influence on the decay of the density\nparameter of the tachyon field and the corresponding increase of the matter field, being\nmore efficient according as the value of \u03be\u2217 decreases. This behavior can be explained by\nnoting that the increase of the coupling parameter \u03be\u2217 increases the energy transfer from\nthe tachyon field to the gravitational field. Furthermore, as was expected, the limiting\ncase \u03be\u2217 \u2192 0 tends to the \u039bCDM model.\nThe deceleration parameter q = 1/2 + 3p/2\u03c1 is plotted as function of the red-shift\n0 \u2264 z \u2264 2 in the right frame of figure 1, whereas in table 1 it is compared the values taken\nfrom the curves with the predicted values of the present deceleration parameter q(0) and\nthe transition red-shift zt where the decelerated period turns over an accelerated period.\nFrom table 1 one infers that all values are almost within the uncertainty of the predicted\nvalues. Furthermore, by increasing the value of the coupling the red-shift transition zt\ndecreases whereas the deceleration parameter q(0) increases. It is noteworthy to call\nattention that for high values of the red-shift the coupling is not important, since the\ndeceleration parameters for different values of coupling parameter \u03be\u2217 tend to a common\nvalue.\nIt is also interesting to analyze the evolution with the red-shift of the coupling\nfunction F (z) for different values of the coupling parameter \u03be\u2217 .

Indeed, the variation of the coupling function\nF is less accentuated for small values of the coupling constant \u03be\u2217 . This behavior was\nexpected due to the expression of F given by equation (23). Another point is that\nfor different values of the coupling parameter \u03be\u2217 the coupling function tends to an\nasymptotic value by increasing values of the red-shift. The behavior of the potential\ndensity V with the red-shift is similar to the coupling function F , since they have the\nsame exponential dependence on \u03c6.\nIn the right frame of figure 2 it is plotted the ratio of the pressure and energy\ndensity of the tachyon field \u03c9\u03c6 = p\u03c6 /\u03c1\u03c6 as function of the red-shift z. One observes\nfrom this figure that \u03c9\u03c6 \u2192 \u22121 when z \u2192 0 for small values of the coupling parameter\n\u03be\u2217 , i.e., for small values of \u03be\u2217 the tachyon field approaches the \u039bCDM model. For high\nvalues of the red-shift \u03c9\u03c6 \u2192 0, i.e., the tachyon field tends to a pressureless matter field.\nThe difference of the apparent and absolute magnitude of a source is defined in\nterms of the luminosity distance and given by\n\"\n\n\u03bc0 = m \u2212 M = 25 + 5 log (1 + z)\n\nZ\n\nz\n0\n\ndz \u2032\n.\nH(z \u2032 )\n#\n\n(37)\n\nIt is plotted in figure 3 as function of the red-shift, where the circles denote observational\ndata of super-novae of type Ia (see reference [12]). Only one curve for the coupled model,\nnamely for \u03be\u2217 = 0.2, was plotted since there is no sensible difference with the \u039bCDM\nmodel when \u03be\u2217 \u2192 0. From this figure one concludes that the values of \u03bc0 for the coupled\nmodel does not differ from the \u039bCDM model for small red-shifts existing only a small\n\n\fConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n\n11\n\n44\n42\n44.5\n\n\u03bc0\n\n40\n44\n\n38\n\n43.5\n43\n\n36\n42.5\n\n34\n0\n\n42\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nz\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 3. \u03bc0 as a function of the red-shift z.

Final remarks\nIn the last section the conditions chosen for the scalar field were: (i) F (0) =\n\u03b3 exp[\u2212\u03be\u03c6(0)] = 1/2 which corresponds to the value of the gravitational constant\npresently and (ii) that tachyon field \u03c6 is rolling very slowly in the late accelerated\nperiod so that \u03c6\u03072 \u226a 1. With these conditions the action (1) becomes\nZ\n\u221a\n(38)\nS = d4 x \u2212g{R/2 \u2212 V } + Sm ,\n\nfor the present time. So one recovers the gravitational action that describes the gravity\nas it is observed today. Moreover, one has a potential term with a cosmological constant\nbehavior which accelerates the actual expansion of the Universe.\nThe action (38), which results from the limit of small derivatives of the field \u03c6,\ncoincides with the actions analyzed in detail for the models proposed in the references\n[14, 15]. Then the limiting situation (38) leads to a constant gravitational coupling\nfor a constant field \u03c6. In this limit the present model is similar to the models in\nthe quoted references which present this limiting propriety, being in accordance with\nthe experimental data. The models proposed in the works [14, 15] can produce an\nexponential solution for the scale factor, characterizing an accelerated expansion. One\nshould hope this same behavior from the field equations of the present model, once\nthere is a relation between the two models for the limit of small derivatives, and this\nreally happens. One may infer this kind of solution by observing that for the late time,\nwhen the small derivatives are imposed for the present model, the solutions describe\na progressing accelerated Universe while the energy density of the matter decays and\n\n\fConstraining non-minimally coupled tachyon fields by Noether symmetry\n\n12\n\nthe energy density of the tachyon field increases. Furthermore, the present model can\ndescribe the inflationary period with the same function of coupling and potential which\ndescribes the present acceleration by taking the limit of small derivatives, but one should\nnote that in the inflationary case the limit of small derivatives is not taken into account.\nIt is also interesting to analyze the evolution equation for the energy density of\nthe coupled tachyon field \u03c1\u03c6 . By differentiating Friedmann equation (8) with respect to\ntime and taking into account the acceleration equation (5) and the expression for the\ncoupling function (18), yields\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H(\u03c1 + p) = \u2212\u03be \u03c6\u0307\u03c1,\n\nhence\n\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c6 + 3H(\u03c1\u03c6 + p\u03c6 ) = \u2212\u03be \u03c6\u0307\u03c1,\n\n(39)\n\nthanks to \u03c1 = \u03c1m + \u03c1\u03c6 , p = p\u03c6 and \u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = 0. From equation (39)2 one can\nunderstand the role played by the coupling constant \u03be on the energy transfer from the\ntachyon field to the gravitational and matter fields.\n7. Conclusions\nAs was explained before the application of Noether symmetry to the Lagrangian density\nis a very important tool, since it guarantees the conservation laws and restricts the\npossible expressions for the potential density and for the coupling function of a tachyon\nfield. Here it was shown that according to Noether symmetry only exponential functions\nof the tachyon filed are possible expressions for the potential density and for the coupling\nfunction of non-minimally coupled tachyon fields.\nThe cosmological solutions found are of two kinds. The first one refers to a nonminimally coupled tachyon field as the only gravitational source of the early Universe\nwhich behaves as an inflaton and leads to an exponential accelerated expansion which\nends in a finite time. In the second one the gravitational sources of the Universe are a\nnon-minimally coupled tachyon field and a pressureless matter field where the tachyon\nfield comports as dark energy and is the responsible for the decelerated-accelerated\ntransition period of the late Universe. In the latter case it was shown that the coupling\nconstant has influence on the density and deceleration parameters and also on the\nluminosity distance, since the coupling constant is connected with the energy transfer\nfrom the tachyon field to the gravitational and matter fields.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the support from CNPq (Brazil).\nReferences\n[1] Peebles P J E and Ratra B 2003 Rev.
