Introduction\nSince 1996 the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nhas regularly observed comets close to the sun with its Large\nAngle Spectrometric coronagraph (LASCO) C2 and C3 cameras. C2 has a circular field of view with a diameter of\naround 1.5\u25e6 while C3 reaches out to almost 4\u25e6 solar elongation. Most of the observed comets belong to the well-known\nKreutz comet group (Biesecker et al. 2002). There appeared,\nhowever, a number of non-Kreutz comets with perihelion distances 0.01 AU < q < 0.1 AU. Similarities in orbital elements\nof a number of objects led to the establishment of three other\ngroups of near-sun comets (Green 2002; Meyer 2003).\nWhile the Meyer group has a mean inclination i = 72.44\u25e6 ,\ncomets of the Marsden and Kracht groups have rather small\ninclinations (see Table 1). Shortly after the discovery of these\nnew groups Marsden (2002) remarked on similarities in the\norbital elements of the Marsden group comets and comet\n96P/Machholz, which has already been associated with various\nmeteor streams. Discussions on the long-term evolution of\nthe Quadrantids (Williams, Murray & Hughes 1979) and 96P\n(Rickman & Froeschl\u00e9 1988) have been brought together by\nMcIntosh (1990), who included the Daytime Arietids as well\nas the Southern and perhaps Northern \u03b4 Aquarids into this\ncomplex of meteor streams and a comet. More recently it\nwas suspected that near-earth asteroid 2003 EH1 is the parent\nbody of the Quadrantids (Jenniskens 2003) and that C/1490\nY1, the Ursids, Carinids and \u03ba Velids might also fit into the\nscheme (McIntosh 1990; Babadzhanov & Obrubov 1992;\nOhtsuka, Nakano & Yoshikawa 2003; Sekanina & Chodas\n2005). Given that the Kracht and Marsden groups fit into\nSend offprint requests to: S. F. H\u00f6nig,\ne-mail: shoenig@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de\n\nTable 1.

In fact,\ntwo pairs of Marsden group comets could be found where\nformal links have been presented by Marsden (2004b, 2005).\nOn the other hand, two suspect Kracht group pairs could\nnot be unequivocally linked due to poor measurments and\nambiguities.\nFurther to the comets of the Marsden and the Kracht groups\nthere exist another three SOHO comets with similar low-i orbital elements which do not fit into the Machholz interplanetary\ncomplex. These are C/1999 R1 (SOHO), C/2002 R5 (SOHO)\nand C/2003 R5 (SOHO). Remarks on the similarity of the apparent C2 tracks of C/1999 R1 and C/2002 R5 came from R.\nKracht shortly after discovery. He also noted the possible relation of C/2003 R5 to this pair.\n\n2. Observations and initial orbits\nAstrometric positions and initial parabolic orbital elements\nfor C/1999 R1 (SOHO), C/2002 R5 (SOHO) and C/2003 R5\n(SOHO) have been published in MPEC 1999\u2013R19, MPEC\n2002\u2013S35 and MPEC 2004\u2013J59, respectively.

They showed no sign of degrading or break-up. On the other hand, C/2002 R5 was less bright\nwhich results in a shorter orbital arc. Its apparent track, however, was quite similar to the other comets and led R. Kracht\nto the conclusion that they may form the core of another new\ncomet group (Marsden 2004a).\n\n3. Identification C/1999 R1 (SOHO) = C/2003 R5\n(SOHO)\nOrbital calaculations were accomplished using Bill Gray's\nFind Orb software1 . It includes perturbations by all major planets plus the Earth's moon and the three largest minor planets (1)\nCeres, (2) Pallas and (4) Vesta. Additionally, relativistic effects\ndue to the comet's small perihelion distance are considered in\nthe software.\nTo get a meaningful link a first step is to choose the most\nvalidated observations. The main problem is that C3 has a scale\nof 55\u2032\u2032 /pixel, while C2 has 12\u2032\u2032 /pixel. For the initial orbital calculation we thus chose only C2 observations. It has to be noted\nthat the 2003 data show higher individual residuals than the\n1999 observations, regardless of whether they are taken as the\nstarting point or not. For the calculations initial parabolic elements for one apparition were taken and the eccentricity e\nwas forced also to match the other apparition. After a rough\nfit this constraint was removed and further integration steps led\nto convergence of the final link. Table 2 presents elements for\nC/1999 R1 (SOHO) and C/2003 R5 (SOHO) from C2 observations only. They have been used as a starting point for the\nlinking, as well as the actual C2 link. Additionally, a link with\nboth C2 and C3 data was calculated (Table 3) where individual C2 observations are weighted 6 times more than individual\nC3 observations. Considering that there are around 3 times as\nmany C3 positions as for C2 the latter ones are overweighted\nby roughly a factor of two \u2013 although C3 still covers a much\n1\n\nsee http://www.projectpluto.com/find orb.htm\n\nTable 3.

A residual table is available online in the\nA&A version. Table 3 shows predictions for the next perihelion passage calculated from the C2 double weighted elements.\nWe want to note that the whole solution appears to be stable in\nthe sense that use of shorter integration steps does not lead to\nother elements with smaller residuals or residuals with similar\nquality. These can be taken as an indication that the link may\nbe correct. Actually a comet with a period of around 4 years\nis somewhat unusual since there is only comet 2P/Encke with\na shorter period. Further arguments for the periodicity of the\nobject, however, will be given in Sect. 4 and the nature of the\nobject \u2013 comet or asteroid \u2013 discussed in Sect. 5.\n\n4. The role of C/2002 R5 (SOHO)\nSince C/2002 R5 (SOHO) has similar orbital elements to\nC/1999 R1 (SOHO) = C/2003 R5 (SOHO) it is worth considering whether there may be some physical association.\nCalculations show that a direct linkage with a periodicity of\nP \u223c 3.0 yr to C/1999 R1 is not possible due to large overall\nresiduals and systematic trends therein. The same applies to the\n2003 apparition and C/2002 R5. Together with its difference in\nbrightness compared to C/1999 R1 and C/2003 R5 we can rule\nout that it is identical with one of the latter two objects. In view\nof the fragmentation history of some members of the other lowinclination comet groups (Marsden 2005) C/1999 R1 = C/2003\n\n\fS. F. H\u00f6nig: Identification of a new short-period comet near the sun\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Backwards integration of various possible orbital elements for C/2002 R5 (SOHO). Each line represents one set of elements with a certain 3.40 yr < P < 4.65 yr, according to the results for C/1999 R1 = 2003 R5 (SOHO). The black line indicates the\norbital evolution of C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 (SOHO), green and blue lines represent elements with P < 3.90 yr and P > 3.95 yr,\nrespectively. The red lines mark the elements for P = 3.90 yr and P = 3.95 yr which show best overall agreement with C/1999 R1\n= C/2003 R5 (SOHO) (see text). The x-axis of each panel represents Julian Date (JD), while the y-axis represents the Ascending\nNode \u03a9, Inclination i, Perihelion Distance q and Eccentricity e, respectively.\nR5 (SOHO) and C/2002 R5 (SOHO) may have a common origin. In other words: C/2002 R5 (SOHO) may have separated\nfrom the parent body C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 (SOHO) sometime in the past \u2013 which seems plausible due to the potential\nparent body's recurring close approaches to the sun. Therefore,\nit is highly interesting to perform backwards integration of both\nobjects to see if the orbital elements have been more identical at\na certain time in the past. For this purpose we have to assume\nthat C/2002 R5 is also of short periodic nature. If it is really\npossible to find hints for a common origin within this scenario,\nit would be a strong argument for the periodicity of C/1999 R1\n= C/2003 R5 (SOHO) aside from the linkage.\nAs a starting point we assume that C/2002 R5 has somewhat similar periodicity to C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5. This can\nbe satisfied by the assumption of fragmentation. We did, however, take a broad range of orbital elements with 3.40 yr < P <\n4.65 yr in steps of 0.05 yr for the backwards integration. A set\nof orbital elements for each step was calculated and put into\nthe freely available orbital integrator Solex 8.52 , developed by\n2\n\nsee http://chemistry.unina.it/\u223calvitagl/solex/\n\nTable 4.

All 26 solutions for C/2002 R5, together\nwith the orbital elements for C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 have\nbeen integrated backwards simultaneously. In general, orbits\nfor SOHO comets show large RMS residuals due to non-perfect\nastrometrical circumstances. Thus backwards integration is a\nproblematic issue, especially in the case of C/2002 R5 where\nthere is only a small orbital arc available and the data quality\n\n\f4\n\nS. F. H\u00f6nig: Identification of a new short-period comet near the sun\n\nis not the best. Since we have the P-constraint from C/1999\nR1's orbit we think that integrating the above mentioned set of\nelements will give us a rough idea of the object's past 200 000\ndays (\u223c 544 yr), although no final statement on the object's past\nwill be possible.\nOur calculations illustrate that the orbital developments of\nC/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 and C/2002 R5 are quite different\nwithin the simulated time span (see Fig. 1). Especially the inclination evolution is quite extreme for most of the elements of\nC/2002 R5 in comparision to C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5. There\nis, however, a certain time span around 2410000 JD where\nthe elements have been quite similar for both objects for periodic solutions around the interval 3.90 yr < P < 3.95 yr.\nThere is no other time within the last 550 yr where such a\ngood agreement in orbital elements can be achieved. Around\n2410000 JD a good match of the Argument of Perihelion \u03c9, the\ninclination i, the eccentricity e, the perihelion distance q, and\nthus also the semi-major axis a to C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 is\nfound. Furthermore the difference in Longitude of Ascending\nNode \u03a9 is smaller than 6\u25e6 (see Table 4). Although the orbits\nof C/2002 R5 and C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 seem to be close\ntogether in the late 18th century, the difference in the angular\nelements did hardly improve with respect to the present elements. Additionally, the longitude of perihelion of C/2002 R5\n(L = 58\u25e6 ) is still way off the value for C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5\n(L = 48\u25e6 ), while the latitude of perihelion matches quite well\n(B = 9\u25e6 for both objects). This may be an effect of the unknown\nscatter in initial conditions for C/2002 R5. As a measure for this\nscatter we illustrated the uncertainities of the elements, based\non the variations for one periodicity interval dP = 0.05yr, in\nTable 4. The resulting deviation may partly explain the large\ndifference in L while the agreement is still not striking. For\na final statement on this scenario it is necessary to improve\nthe quality of the current orbit. If C/2002 R5 is really periodic\nand has seperated from the parent body in the late 19th century\n(probably around 1890 \u00b1 10), we may soon reobserve it.\nThe first step to test this scenario would be a search for\nC/2002 R5 in LASCO data at the previous return. The problem\nis that it should have appeared in September or early October,\n1998. At around this time there are no LASCO images availbale since SOHO experienced major problems. Therefore we\nencourage observations at the possible next return in 2006 (see\nTable 5). On the other hand, periodicities which placed the object around perihelion later than the end of October 1998 or\nearlier than July 1998 can almost certainly be ruled out since\nthere was nothing found in the LASCO archives, although thoroughly inspected by several people. It has to be pointed out that\nthe actual time of perihelion for the next return is much more\nuncertain than the difference in the orbits may suggest.\n\n5. Comet or minor planet?\nIt is widely known that almost no SOHO comet displays\na tail, except for a number of Kreutz group members and\nvery few bright other comets. Nevertheless, all objects are\ndesignated and referred to as comets, mostly because of the\nparabolic elements that fit into this scheme, and the origin\nof the Kreutz group where small tail-less members are frag-\n\nTable 5.

The suggested\nconnection between comet 96P/Machholz and the Kracht and\nMarsden groups supports this procedure. Additionally there are\nhints that the identified recurring objects of these groups show\na trend to have fainter second perihelion passages as a result\nof their losing a lot of material and thus desintegrate over time\n(Sekanina & Chodas 2005).\nGiven the semi-major axis a \u223c 2.52 AU of C/1999 R1 =\nC/2003 R5, one may ask whether this object is really a comet\nor an Alinda-type asteroid close to the 3:1 resonance with\nJupiter. In fact, no tail was visible, in either C3 or in C2 images. It is also not clear if the object displayed a coma. We\naccomplished an analysis of photometric data acquired during\nthe 1999 perihelion passage (Biesecker 1999) and searched for\npossible phase effects which would be typical asteroidal behaviour. It has to be noted that photometric measurements from\nLASCO images are highly affected by a number of disturbing\nfactors, such as severe radial vignetting or obscuration by the\npylon (Biesecker et al. 2002). An analysis of the absolute magnitude of this object with standard minor planet (G = 0.15) and\ncometary (n = 2.0) slope parameters give no conclusive answer (Table 6). Both possibilities satisfy the photometric data\nand allow for similar standard deviation in their absolute magnitudes. It has to be remarked that the absolute value for H MP\nis not consistent with the standard translation to the object's\nsize (\u223c 10 km). From estimations for other SOHO comets its\nsize should be of the order of 10s of meters up to perhaps 100\nmeters, depending on its actual nature.\n\n6. Discussion\nWe present the identification of a new short periodic comet\nwhich was only observed with the SOHO spacecraft so far. We\nlinked the objects C/1999 R1 and C/2003 R5 as two consecutive perihelion passages of the same object. Orbital elements\nfor the next return in 2007 were calculated. Additionally, we\nshow that the third object, C/2002 R5, with similar orbital elements may be a fragment of the periodic comet and has separated from it some time in the late 19th century. Aside from the\norbital link this supports the idea of short periodicity of C/1999\nR1 = C/2003 R5. If the whole scenario is true, C/2002 R5 may\nbe observed in 2006 with the SOHO satellite. In the last section\nwe discussed the nature of C/1999 R1 = C/2003 R5 and concluded that from currently available photometric measurements\n\n\fS. F.
