High resolution imaging indicates that their luminosities are intrinsic and not\ncaused by lensing (e.g., Fan et al. 2001, 2003; Richards et al. 2004). X-ray (Brandt et\nal. 2002; Mathur, Wilkes & Ghosh 2002; Shemmer et al. 2005), UV/optical and near-IR\nspectroscopic observations (Fan et al. 2003; Barth et al. 2003; Maiolino et al. 2003) show\nthat these sources share many properties with luminous QSOs at lower redshift (z . 2). In\nparticular, ultraviolet continua, high ionization emission lines, and strong low ionization MgII\nand FeII emission are all present in proportions consistent with the low redshift counterparts.\n1\n\nSpace Science Institute, 4750 Walnut Street, Suite 205 Boulder, CO 80301\n\n2\n\nSteward Observatory, The University of Arizona, 933 N. Cherry Ave., Tucson, AZ 85721\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nSubmillimeter and centimeter radio observations indicate that these QSOs have copious\ndust (e.g., Omont et al. 1996; Bertoldi et al. 2003a, 2003b; Robson et al. 2004; Carilli\net al. 2004), but this cool material may simply be heated by massive star formation in\nhighly luminous host galaxies, and thus be unrelated to the QSO activity. Active nuclei can\nheat dust directly to produce stronger mid-infrared emission than is characteristic of star\nformation. This behavior is common in radio galaxies and QSOs at low redshift (Neugebauer\net al. 1986; Low et al. 1988, 1989; Polletta et al. 2000; Wilkes et al. 2000; Kuraszkiewicz\net al. 2003; Haas et al. 1998, 2000, 2003; Shi et al. 2005). However, the IRAS and ISO\nobservatories were not sensitive enough to probe this type of emission in high-redshift QSOs.\nThe Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer: Werner et al. 2004) provides sufficient sensitivity\nto search for this mid-IR emission from even the most highly redshifted QSOs currently\nknown. As part of a large survey of luminous AGN, we have observed 13 high redshift\n(z > 4.5), UV/optically-selected QSOs with the goal of comparing their spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) with lower redshift objects. In this Letter, we use the new observations\nto study the rest wavelengths between 0.6 and 4.3\u03bcm, a region containing the characteristic\nlocal minimum (\u03bb \u223c 1.5\u03bcm) in QSO SEDs as well as the thermal emission from the hot\n(Tdust & 300K), AGN-heated dust. A complementary General Observer program will report\non a larger sample of high redshift QSOs and will investigate their SEDs from X-ray through\nthe Spitzer and radio wavelengths (Fan et al., in prep).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nImages at 24\u03bcm (5.\u2032\u2032 25 \u00d7 5.\u2032\u2032 25/pixel) were obtained for each object using the photometry\nmode of MIPS (Rieke et al. 2004) as part of the MIPS GTO program titled \"The Far-IR\nSpectral Energy Distributions of Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei\" (PID 82). After initial\nprocessing by the Spitzer Science Center (SSC) pipeline (S10.5.0) to provide reconstructed\npointing information, the MIPS data were further processed into a final image using the MIPS\nData Analysis Tool (DAT, ver. 2.71) developed by the MIPS Instrument Team (Gordon et\nal. 2004, 2005). Aperture photometry was performed on the images with IDP3 (version\n2.9: Schneider & Stobie 2002), using a 14.\u2032\u2032 7 target aperture and a background annulus from\n29.\u2032\u2032 4 \u2013 41.\u2032\u20327. The median background per pixel was scaled to the appropriate target aperture\nsize and subtracted from the summed target aperture flux for each object. The final flux\nin instrumental units was then corrected to an infinite aperture, and conversion to physical\nflux density units was performed by multiplying the instrumental total flux by the MIPS\ncalibration factor (MIPS Data Handbook, V3.1, hereafter MDH3.1). Random uncertainties\nin the background\u2013subtracted estimates of on\u2013source flux were estimated from the rms pixel-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nto-pixel dispersion inside the background annulus measured on the image and scaled to the\narea of the target aperture. The final uncertainties are dominated by the absolute calibration\nuncertainty of 10%.\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC: Fazio et al. 2004) observations of nine QSOs were obtained in channels 1, 2, 3 and 4 (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0\u03bcm). Images were obtained as Basic\nCalibrated Data products from the SSC data pipeline (S11.5.0) as described in the SOM4.6\nand the Pipeline Description Document available through the SSC. Aperture photometry\nwas performed using a 3 pixel (3.\u2032\u2032 66) target aperture and background annuli from 3-7 pixels.\nOther aspects of the photometry were similar to the procedures used at 24\u03bcm. The measurement uncertainties were estimated from the rms noise in the background annulus. The\nuncertainty in absolute calibration is 3 \u2212 5% (Reach et al. 2005).\nThe measured flux densities for each object are presented in Table 1 along with their\nmeasurement uncertainties. The QSOs were detected with high signal-to-noise in the MIPS\n24\u03bcm band, and in all four bands for the nine objects that were observed with IRAC. The\nobjects were unresolved, except for BR 1202-0725, which is known to have a nearby, IRbright companion galaxy 2.\u2032\u2032 6 to the NW (e.g., Hu et al. 1996; Ohyama et al. 2004). For this\nobject, the photometry in the IRAC and MIPS bands was re-derived using a two component\nPSF-fit. Only the flux densities attributable to the QSO are presented in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\nSpectral Energy Distributions\n\nFigure 1 shows the rest-frame UV through mid-IR SEDs of the high redshift sample.\nA composite SED for radio-quiet QSOs is also shown in each panel for comparison (Elvis\net al. 1994). The composite represents the average behavior of low redshift QSOs, but\nindividual objects can show significant deviations. In Figure 1c, we also present the radio\nloud composite SED from Elvis et al. (1994), and a composite constructed only from the PG\nQSOs (Sanders et al. 1989). The high redshift QSOs generally match the composite SEDs\nand would not be obviously distinguishable from typical, optically selected luminous QSOs\nat low redshift. In particular, the rise in the high-redshift SEDs for \u03bb & 1.5\u03bcm is likely to\nbe the signature of thermal emission from hot dust (e.g., Rieke & Lebofsky 1981; Cutri et\nal. 1985; Barvanis 1990; Elvis et al. 1994; Haas et al. 1998, 2000, 2003).\nThe deviations from the composite SEDs are not surprising. A few objects (e.g., SDSS\nJ1148+5251, BR0004-6224) show a more rapid rise into the infrared, and SDSS J0836+0054\nis radio loud (Petric et al. 2003), but their behavior still lies within the scatter seen for\nlower redshift objects (Elvis et al. 1994). The rapid decrease for \u03bb . 0.2\u03bcm in the SEDs\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nof the three QSOs with z\u2265 5.8 is caused by absorption from the Ly\u03b1 forest in the observed\nframe. In addition, the photometric bands that contain the H\u03b1 emission line in each object\nare elevated above the extrapolated continuum.\nAt low redshift, the strength of the \u03bb \u2248 3.7\u03bcm infrared band is correlated with the\nB-band flux density implying that IR emission arises from hot dust heated directly by the\nUV/optical continuum from the central active nucleus (Rieke & Lebofsky 1981; Cutri et al.\n1985; Barvanis 1990; Haas et al. 2003). The rest frame flux density ratios F\u03bd (3.7\u03bcm)/F\u03bd (B)\nderived from the three composite SEDs shown in Figure 1c are 7.8, 6.0 and 5.6 for the\nradio-quiet, radio-loud QSOs and the PG QSOs, respectively. A recent Spitzer investigation\nof the SEDs of unreddened, low-redshift QSOs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) suggests that this ratio can be somewhat larger (\u223c 8 \u2212 9: Richards et al. 2006).\nThe ratio for our sample of high redshift QSOs is 8.1 \u00b1 1. X-ray to UV/optical emission is\nalso correlated, with the X-ray to UV/optical spectral index depending on the luminosity of\nthe AGN, but there is negligible dependence of the spectral index on redshift (e.g., Strateva\net al. 2005). These correlations together suggest that the source of the 3.7\u03bcm emission in\nQSOs is the same over a range of luminosities and for redshifts from z\u223c 0.1 to 6.4, and that\nthe mid-infrared feature is emitted from dust heated directly by the central active nucleus.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMany lines of evidence suggest that the high-redshift QSOs are essentially indistinguishable from their lower redshift counterparts. The rest frame UV/optical continua and\nemission lines (e.g., Barth et al. 2003; Fan et al. 2004), and the derived metallicities, are all\ntypical of low redshift QSOs (e.g., Pentericci et al. 2002; Maiolino et al. 2003). The objects\nalso have similar X-ray (Brandt et al. 2002; Mathur, Wilkes & Ghosh 2002), sub-millimeter\n(Bertoldi et al. 2003a; Robson et al. 2004), and radio properties (Bertoldi et al. 2003b;\nCarilli et al. 2004; Frey et al. 2005). Estimates of the masses of the super-massive black\nholes in some of these high-redshift systems imply MSMBH \u223c 109 M\u2299 (e.g., Willott, McLure\n& Jarvis 2003), comparable to low redshift QSOs. Our Spitzer measurements strengthen the\nevidence that QSOs have similar properties over the entire range of observed redshifts. Thus,\nthe fundamental structures that characterize luminous QSOs in the local universe, including\nhot dust heated directly by the active nucleus, were already in place in these objects \u223c 900\nMyrs after the big bang1 .\nThe presence of substantial amounts of both cold and hot dust around the high-redshift\n1\n\nH0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nQSOs (e.g., Bertoldi et al. 2003a; Robson et al. 2004; this work) is consistent with their\napparently unobscured ultraviolet continua only if, as with lower-redshift QSOs (e.g., Neugebauer et al. 1986; Low et al. 1988, 1989), the dust is in structures that leave some lines\nof sight unobscured. Many of the ultra- and hyperluminous infrared galaxies have been\nshown to harbor QSOs that are typical of UV/optically-selected objects, but are obscured\nfrom direct view by dust (e.g., Hines et al. 1995; 1999; Young et al. 1996; Goodrich et al.\n1996; Tran et al. 2000). The many so-called Type-2 QSOs that have been identified (at\nz \u2264 1) in the SDSS (Zakamska et al. 2003, 2004, 2005) and with Spitzer (e.g., Mart\u0131\u0301nezSansigre et al. 2005) also must have obscuring material. Possibilities for these structures\ninclude the circumnuclear torus envisioned in simple unified schemes (e.g., Antonucci 1993;\nRowan-Robinson 1995; Urry & Padovani 2000) or more complex structures in disk winds\n(e.g., Konigl & Kartje 1994; Kartje & Konigl 1996; Elvis 2000).\nIn this context, the currently identified high redshift QSOs would then represent only\na fraction of the true space density of such objects, with the remainder obscured in our\ndirection by their circumnuclear material. Furthermore, reionization of the intergalactic\nmedium by these objects would not be distributed spherically around each QSO, but would\ninstead extend in reionization (bi) cones analogous to the ionization bicones seen in the\ninterstellar media of nearby QSOs.\nIt appears that the solid state emission features associated with aromatic molecules play\nan important role in the Spitzer 24\u03bcm detections of objects out to z \u223c 2.2 (e.g., Caputi et al.\n2005). At larger redshifts, the effects of these features on the detection rates will decrease,\nbecause: 1.) they begin to move out of the MIPS band; 2.) at the extremely high galaxy\nluminosities required for detections, the equivalent widths of the features are reduced; and\n3.) the effects of low metallicity and hard UV continua will tend to destroy the carriers (e.g.,\nEnglebracht et al. 2005 and references therein). Our results show that the rest-frame nearand mid-infrared continua of luminous AGNs remain strong to at least z \u223c 6. Thus, we\nexpect that such AGNs will play an increasing role in the 24\u03bcm detections above z = 2.2,\nand will probably dominate the detections for z > 3.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom new 3.5, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 and 24\u03bcm Spitzer measurements of high-z QSOs (z \u2265 4.5)\nwe find:\n\u2022 The QSOs are easily detected with IRAC and MIPS at 0.6-4.3\u03bcm in the rest frame.\n\u2022 There is no obvious evolutionary trend in the UV through mid-IR SEDs compared\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwith low redshift QSOs (z . 2).\n\u2022 The high redshift QSOs conform to the relationship between LB and L3.7\u03bcm as established for low redshift AGN, supporting the conclusion that the rest-frame emission\nnear 4\u03bcm in the high redshift objects originates from hot dust heated directly by the\ncentral active nucleus.\n\u2022 AGNs will play an increasing role in the Spitzer 24\u03bcm detections above z = 2.2, and\nwill probably dominate the detections for z > 3.\nOur results add further evidence that the fundamental structures of QSOs can be established by z = 6.4, corresponding to \u223c 900 Myr after the big bang. They also suggest that\nthere is a population of QSOs at these redshifts that will be extremely difficult to identify\ndue to dust obscuration along the line of sight.\nWe thank D. Sanders and B.

The objects and redshifts are\nindicated in the legends. Panels (a) & (b) show objects for which both MIPS and IRAC observations were\nobtained. Heavy solid curves (without individual data points) in panels (a) & (b) show the Elvis et al.\n(1994) radio-quiet QSO composite SED for comparison. Panel (c) shows objects for which only MIPS 24\u03bcm\nobservations were obtained. Panel (c) also presents the Elvis et al. (1994) radio-quiet composite SED, but in\nthis panel the SED is fitted to the rest frame UV/optical photometry for each object. For comparison, BR\n2237-0607 is also fit with: (dotted line) the radio-loud composite SED of Elvis et al. (1994); and (triple-dot,\nlong-dash line) a composite SED constructed from PG QSOs (Sanders et al. 1989).\n\n\fTable 1.
