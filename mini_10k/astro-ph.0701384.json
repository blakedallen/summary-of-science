Seyfert galaxies, as relatively\nnearby low-luminosity active galaxies, can be studied in particular detail. These objects contain emission lines within\ntheir spectrum, including in general broad lines produced\nwithin the inner parsec, close to the central black hole and\naccretion disk, and narrow lines whose region of production may extend over a kiloparsec. In addition, many Seyfert\ngalaxies have weak radio emission, often in a linear structure\ncorresponding to an outflow from the central active nucleus.\nThe physics of emission lines is of particular interest.\nThese are thought mostly to arise through photoionization,\nand many studies have been done which use sophisticated\nphotoionization models to reproduce emission lines in great\ndetail. However, additional physics may be needed to reproduce some lines. In particular, the near-infrared [Feii] line\nat 1.257\u03bcm has been suggested as a diagnostic of shock excitation, which may arise as dust grains are dissociated in\nfast shocks (e.g. Forbes & Ward 1993). The idea that shocks\nmay have general applicability to AGN spectra was argued\nby Sutherland et al. (2003) and Dopita & Sutherland (1995)\nwho succeeded in reproducing many characteristic photoionized spectra using shock models. This arises because shocks\n\ngenerate UV and X-ray photons which can then ionize the\ngas \u2013 indeed, the difference between the observed properties\nof such \"autoionizing\" shocks and regions photoionized by\na central active nucleus can be quite subtle and depend on\nthe details of the spectra of the incident photons.\nMore recently, Simpson et al. (1996) showed that the\nobserved [Feii] line is also consistent with predominantly\nbeing produced by photoionization, and Mouri, Kawara &\nTaniguchi (2000) conducted more sophisticated calculations\nsuggesting that electron collisions in a partially-ionized zone\nassociated with a shock may be the production mechanism rather than grain dissociation. Based on such studies,\nAlonso-Herrero et al. (1997) propose the use of the ratio of\ninfrared [Feii] lines to the hydrogen recombination lines to\nseparate active galaxies from starbursts. Oliva et al. (2001)\nstudied the problem of shock ionization versus photoionization. They suggested that the [Pii] line is potentially useful\nin disentangling this problem, because similar physical conditions are needed to produce it to those which produce\n[Feii], but unlike iron, phosphorus is not produced in destruction of dust grains. A high Fe/P ratio is thus a prediction of models in which dust grains are dissociated by\nshocks. Oliva et al. find that pure photoionization better\nfits their spectrum of the very bright Seyfert galaxy NGC\n1068. In fainter galaxies where [Pii] is not detected, even\n\n\f2\n\nN. Jackson and R. J. Beswick\n\nlower limits on the Fe/P ratio may be useful in ruling out\nshock models if the spectra are sensitive enough.\nAlthough Seyfert galaxies have been studied extensively\nin the optical, high signal-to-noise observations in the nearinfrared are rarer. A compilation has recently been published by Riffel, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila & Pastoriza (2006) including many of their own JHK spectra (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila,\nRiffel & Pastoriza 2005). Many of these spectra suggest that\nthe line ratio of active galaxies have a [Feii]/H\u03b2 ratio suggestive of X-ray heating or regions of star formation. Recently, Ramos Almeida et al. (2006) have published infrared\nspectra of one of the objects discussed here, Mkn 78, and\ndeduce from observations and simulations that the predominant line-excitation mechanism in the nuclear region is photoionization by the hard UV continuum from the active nucleus, although radio-induced shocks may contribute within\none of the radio lobes.\nIn this work we choose objects in which linear radio\nstructure is clearly seen in order to investigate the emissionline structure along the jet axis and look for evidence for\nshock excitation. If shocks are indeed an important part of\nthe physics, the area where the radio jet is depositing energy\ninto the interstellar medium is an obvious place to look.\nThe spectra presented here are from deep exposures (1\u20132\nhours with an 8-m class telescope) and therefore allow us to\ninvestigate both nuclear and off-nuclear emission.\n\nblackbody spectrum of 7200K for the Hipparcos F0V star\nHIP36366 (Perryman 1997) and temperatures of 7200K and\n7000K for the stars HIP56601 and HIP75411 respectively.\nThe Pa5\u21923, 6\u21923 and higher order absorption bands were\ninteractively edited out of the stellar spectrum before this\nprocess in order to avoid them appearing as emission lines\nin the divided spectrum.\nFor deriving velocity profiles, successive rows of the\nsky-subtracted image have been extracted, continuumsubtracted using line-free regions immediately around each\nline, and fitted with Gaussian profiles. Profile fitting has\nbeen done by software written by us, using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm as implemented by Press et al. (1992).\nIn addition to the infra-red data, some data from the\nIsaac Newton Group (ING) archive was extracted for the\nSeyfert galaxy Markarian 34. These data were taken using\nthe William Herschel 4.2-m telescope on La Palma on 1998\nDecember 17 using the ISIS two-arm spectrograph. On the\nred arm of this spectrograph the TEK-2 chip was used together with an R600R grating, using a 1.\u2032\u2032 23 slit and a resulting spectral resolution of just over 0.2nm. The data were\nco-added and fluxes of [Oi] and H\u03b1 derived assuming a flat\nspectral response over this wavelength range, because both\nthe TEK-2 chip and the R600R grating have a flat spectral\nresponse over this range to within a few percent.\n\n2.2\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\nInfrared and optical data\n\nAll infrared observations were conducted using the 8-m\nGemini-North Telescope, Mauna Kea, on the nights of 2005\nFebruary 17, February 18 and May 22 using the NIRI imaging spectrograph in f/6 spectroscopy mode. The J grism was\nused with a J-band order-sorting filter, giving a wavelength\nrange of approximately 1.05\u03bcm \u2013 1.42\u03bcm, together with a\n4-pixel slit which corresponds to 0.\u2032\u2032 46 on the sky and a resolving power of about 600 (Hodapp et al. 2003). Mkn 78 was\nobserved for 2 hours on 2005 February 17, Mkn 34 for 2 hours\non 2005 February 18 and NGC 5929 for 70 minutes on 2005\nMay 22. Each observation was divided into 3\u00d730 second exposures, and each successive exposure was chopped up and\ndown the slit to make sky subtraction easier and minimize\neffects of bad pixels. Lamp flatfield exposures and argon arc\nexposures were also obtained for Mkn 34 and Mkn 78. In the\ncase of NGC 5929, no argon lamp spectrum is available and\nin this case the atmospheric OH lines have been used for\nwavelength calibration.\nData reduction was performed using the Starlink figaro package and began with combination of the flatfields\nand division of the data frames by a flatfield normalised in\nthe spectral direction. A second-order polynomial fit to at\nleast six arc lines was obtained which gave a maximum error of 0.1 nm across the wavelength range. The spectra were\ncorrected for S-distortion using three spectra of the Hipparcos stars taken at different positions on the chip. The sky\nwas then subtracted using the Figaro task polysky and the\nspectra extracted using the optimal extraction algorithm of\nHorne (1986) using the Figaro task optextract.\nRelative flux calibration was performed assuming a\n\nRadio data\n\nComplementary, mainly previously-published (Falcke, Wilson & Simpson 1998; Whittle & Wilson 2004) public domain\nradio data for each of these three sources were obtained and\nre-mapped for comparison purposes from the NRAO's Very\nLarge Array (VLA) archive. In each case these data were\nobserved at a wavelength 3.6 cm and in the VLA's highest\nresolution configuration, providing an angular resolution of\n\u223c0.2-0.3 arcsec which is directly comparable to the spectroscopic observations presented. A brief summary of the\nobserving parameters is given in Table 1. Each data-set was\ncalibrated using standard data reduction techniques within\nNRAO's aips package where these data were edited before\nphase solutions from a nearby reference source were applied.\nIn each case the flux density scale was calibrated with respect to 3C 286 using the Baars et al. (1977) scale.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS AND LINE DIAGNOSTICS\nMkn 34 (z=0.0505)\n\nMarkarian 34 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy with a 2.\u2032\u2032 4 extended radio structure whose extended optical line emission has been\nstudied in detail by Whittle et al. (1988) and Falcke, Wilson & Simpson (1998). Its off-nuclear line emission shows\na velocity profile with relatively broad [Oiii] emission extending slightly beyond the radio lobes. There is a distinct\ndifference between the velocity of the line emission near to\nthe nucleus and that beyond the radio lobes. The new infrared spectrum was taken with the slit at a position angle\n158\u25e6 East of North, coincident with the radio axis. Figure\n1 shows the image of the spectrum along the slit, showing\na clear rotation-type velocity profile in all securely detected\nlines (Hei, [Feii], Pa\u03b2 and Pa\u03b3).\n\n\fInfra-red spectra of Seyferts\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

J-band spectrum of Mkn 34, showing the brightest\nemission lines.\n\n[Pii] is detected at a marginal level in the nuclear spectrum. In the nuclear region, the ratio [Feii]\u03bb1.257/[Pii] is\n3.2\u00b11.0, which is consistent with the range of values typical\nof nuclear photoionization (Oliva et al. 2001).\nThe radio map of Falcke et al. (1998) shows structure\nsimilar to that seen earlier by Ulvestad & Wilson (1984) at 6\nand 20 cm, but with higher angular resolution and sensitivity\nshows the definition of the radio jet structure more clearly.\nIn particular the jet is resolved into several discrete knots\nand a significant change in the projected position angle of\nthe tip of the southeastern jet is seen.\nThe most striking feature of the spectrum is the different distribution between [Feii] and the other lines. Figure\n2 illustrates the rotation curve and strength of the lines,\nand it is clear that [Feii] has a bright knot about 1.\u2032\u2032 2 to\nthe SE. This is just behind the bright radio knot in the\nsoutheastern jet imaged here and by Whittle et al. (1988).\nAlthough the Paschen recombination lines are slightly enhanced in the off-nuclear regions compared to the nucleus,\nthe ratio of [Feii]/Pa\u03b2 becomes a factor of 2\u20133 stronger away\nfrom the nucleus, suggesting that different ionization mechanisms may be operating here. The Hei line displays a different behaviour to the hydrogen recombination lines, showing\na smooth decrease in each direction away from the nucleus\nwith little sign of any increase in strength in the radio lobes.\n\nFigure 2.

J-band spectrum of NGC 5929, showing the brightest\nemission lines.\n\n3.2\n\nern radio lobe. Around the northeastern radio lobe, there is\nsome evidence of disturbed kinematics in the [Feii] line.\n\nNGC 5929 (z=0.00831)\n\nNGC5929 is a Seyfert galaxy with a radio jet extending\nabout 0.\u2032\u2032 7 in PA \u223c 60\u25e6 either side of a compact nucleus (Su\net al. 1996; Cole et al. 1998) and extended optical emission\npartly coincident with the western radio lobe (Bower et al.\n1994), strongly suggesting an interaction. Nuclear infrared\nspectroscopy was performed by Simpson et al. (1996) who\nclearly detected the [Feii] line and found it to be marginally\nresolved. The current observations have a smaller pixel scale,\nand we clearly see the resolution in this object, using a slit\nat the position angle of the extended optical emission previously seen (65\u25e6 ). The nuclear spectrum is shown in Figure\n3.\nIn the nuclear emission the [Pii] line is detected at\njust over the 3\u03c3 level; a previous spectrum reported by\nRodr\u0131\u0301gues-Ardila, Riffel & Pastoriza (2005) and Riffel et\nal. (2006) did not detect this line. A Gaussian fit to the\n[Feii] and [Pii] lines was carried out, constraining the [Pii]\nline width to be equal to that of [Feii]. The [Feii]/[Pii] ratio\nis 4.3\u00b11.1 in the nuclear region, which again is typical of\nphotoionized regions and considerably less than the value of\n\u223c20 expected for shock ionization (Oliva et al. 2001). The\n[Feii]/Pa\u03b2 ratio is approximately 1, in agreement with the\nprevious spectra.\nFigure 4 shows the radio map; similar structure is seen\nto the earlier radio map of Su et al. (1996) and Cole et al.\n(1998) with a compact core and two lobe structures detected.\nThe most remarkable feature of the spectrum is the\nwholesale displacement of the line emission from the centre of the galaxy and of the velocity profile (Figure 5). This\neffect is extreme around the southwestern radio lobe, where\nthe [Feii] line strength peaks. The Hei line peak is also offset, although by less than the [Feii]. Optical studies with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (Bower et al. 1994) have also\nrevealed [Oiii] emission which peaks around the southwest-\n\n3.3\n\nMkn 78 (z=0.03715)\n\nMkn 78 has recently been the subject of an extensive optical study with the Hubble Space Telescope by Whittle\n& Wilson (2004), Whittle et al. (2004) and Whittle et al.\n(2005) specifically directed at disentangling shock ionization\nand photoionization. This Seyfert galaxy has extended radio emission, in a linear structure about 2\u2032\u2032 long in an E-W\ndirection, and Whittle & Wilson (2004) have imaged a large\nand complex extended structure in [Oiii] extending 3\u2032\u2032 from\nthe nucleus in each direction. In these observations the slit\nwas aligned in PA 90\u25e6 in the hope of detecting significant\nextended structure in the infrared emission lines. The nuclear spectrum of this object is shown in Figure 6, and the\nmeasurements of the extended emission and velocity profile\nare displayed in Figure 7.\nIn the optical observations of Whittle et al. (2005), very\ncomplex extended optical line emission was detected in all\nmajor recombination and forbidden lines. In these infrared\nobservations, the structure is not well resolved either spatially or spectrally. However, the overall rotation curve is\ndetected in extended emission in three major emission lines,\nHei, [Feii] and Pa\u03b2, covering about 2\u2032\u2032 to the East of the\nnucleus. Relatively little line emission is seen to the West,\nwhich is also the direction of lower surface brightness in\n[Oiii] from the maps of Whittle & Wilson (2004).\nA recent detailed infrared study has been carried out\nwith the LIRIS spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope by Ramos Almeida et al. (2006). They find a nuclear\nratio of [Feii]/Pa\u03b1 which is consistent with photoionization\nfrom the active nucleus. Moreover, they detect [Pii] in the\nnucleus at a strength that is a factor of 1.82 lower than\nthe [Feii]\u03bb1.644 line. This ratio is also consistent with photoionization, being similar to the ratio found in NGC 1068\nby Oliva et al. (2001), and is inconsistent with shock mod-\n\n\fInfra-red spectra of Seyferts\n-2.0\n\nRelative distance (arcsec)\n\n-0.6\n\n-1.5\n\nSW\n\n-1.0\n\nRelative distance (arcsec)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nHeI\n\n2.0\n\n5\n\n[FeII]\n\nNE\n\n-0.4\n-0.2\n\nPa\u03b2\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n\nFigure 6.

Central panel: Velocity profile of NGC 5929. Two lines\nare shown, Hei (circles) and [Feii] (squares). Line quantities have\nbeen measured by Gaussian fits to successive rows of the spectral image, and the amplitude within each sequence of line fits is\nproportional to the size of the symbol. Each successive line has\nbeen offset by 200 km s\u22121 for clarity.

The bottom panel shows the\nvariation of the line ratio [Feii]/Heiover the same scale.\n\nels. However, in the extended emission associated with the\nwestern radio lobe, they find that the [Feii] line strength\nincreases by a factor \u223c2 relative to the hydrogen recombination lines, suggesting a contribution from interaction with\nthe radio bow shock. We find a similar effect in our data,\nwith an enhancement in [Feii] which peaks at \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 6 from the\nnucleus. However, the association of increased [Feii] emission\nwith the radio structure is less obvious in this object than\nin the other two in this study. In the western lobe the peak\nof the [Feii] does coincide with the W-knot of radio emission\nseen at higher resolution by Whittle et al. (2004) and shown\nin the superposed uniformly weighted image in the top panel\nof figure 7. The stronger, eastern radio jet is co-spatial with\n\nNuclear emission: the [Feii]/[Pii] ratio\n\nThis paper adds to the total number of detections of\n[Pii]\u03bb1.188\u03bcm in the literature. Since its original detection\nin NGC 1068 by Oliva et al. (2001) the line has been detected in the Seyfert 1 galaxy Akn 564 by Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila,\nRiffel & Pastoriza (2005), in Mkn 78 by Ramos Almeida et\nal. (2006), and in a total of 11 galaxies in the compilation\nof Riffel et al. (2006). Although very marginal, the detections of [Pii] in Mkn 34 and NGC 5929 suggest [Feii]/[Pii]\nratios of 3\u20134, in agreement with ratios determined in other\nobjects. Comparison with the models presented by Oliva et\nal. (2001) suggests that the dominant ionization mechanism\nis photoionization by the active nucleus rather than shock\nexcitation; fast shocks would be expected to disrupt dust\ngrains and produce line ratios a factor of 10 higher.\n4.2\n4.2.1\n\nExtended emission\nLine diagnostic diagrams\n\nThere have been a number of investigations which have attempted to compare near-infrared line ratios with ionization codes. Many have used the cloudy code (Ferland et al.\n1998) for a range of physical parameters, namely: density of\n\n\fN. Jackson and R. J.

Also interesting is the optical [Oi]\u03bb6300 line, as this\nhas a similar ionization potential to [Feii] and is produced\nin a partially-ionized zone with similar physical properties\nto the region producing [Feii]. It can therefore serve as an\nalternative diagnostic of shock excitation to [Pii]. Although\nmuch stronger than [Pii], [Oi] suffers from the disadvantage\nthat the [Oi]/[Feii] ratio is subject to substantial reddening\nand is difficult to measure with the same instrument.\nThe effect of different physical parameters on the relative strengths of the [Feii] and hydrogen recombination lines\n(in particular Pa\u03b2 ) can be summarized as follows (Simpson\net al. 1996, Mouri et al. 2000; Ramos Almeida et al. 2006):\n\u2022 Metal abundance changes the [Feii]/Pa\u03b2 ratio by approximately the scaling of the abundance, for example by a\nfactor of \u223c6 from solar to Orion abundance.\n\u2022 Neutral hydrogen density has relatively little effect, except at very high densities when the forbidden lines are in\nany case close to collisional de-excitation. For most values\nof ionization parameter, increasing densities decreases the\nrelative strength of [Feii] very slightly.\n\u2022 Increasing ionization parameter causes a slow decrease\nin the [Feii]/Pa\u03b2 ratio below U = 10\u22121.5 , and a rapid increase above this.\n\u2022 The slope of the power-law has a drastic effect on the\n[Feii]/Pa\u03b2 ratio; a steepening by 0.4 (from \u22121.0 to \u22121.4)\ntypically halves the ratio, and the ratio becomes even smaller\nif a 40000-K blackbody model is adopted instead. This was\nconsidered in detail by Simpson et al. (1996), although\nRamos Almeida et al. (2006) use an index of \u22122.0 throughout their simulations.\n\nFigure 7. Velocity profile of Mkn 78. Three lines are shown,\nHei (circles), Pa\u03b2 (crosses), [Feii] (squares). Line quantities have\nbeen measured by Gaussian fits to successive rows of the spectral image, and the amplitude within each sequence of line fits is\nproportional to the size of the symbol. Each successive line has\nbeen offset by 200 km s\u22121 for clarity. The radio map (top panel)\nis made using the data of Whittle & Wilson (2004); it shows the\ncentral part of the radio emission, rotated to the axis of the spectrograph slit. Superposed on this radio map is a higher resolution\n(0.\u2032\u2032 075) uniformly weighted radio image of the core and inner jet.\nThis inner image uses the same contouring scheme as the outer\nimage with a lowest contour value contour of 0.1 mJy beam\u22121 .\nThe apparent high amplitude of the [Feii] line at 0.\u2032\u2032 7 is the result\nof a noisy fit which is unlikely to be representative of the true\nflux; the same is true of the Pa\u03b2 line at 0.\u2032\u2032 45.

Others\nhave used the mappings code or modifications to it (Sutherland et al. 1993; Mouri et al. 2000). Of particular interest\nis the ratio of [Feii] to the other lines available in the near-\n\nIn order to compare results with physical models and\nextract physical information from the line ratios, we have\nused the cloudy program (Ferland et al. 1998), version\nc06.02b. Models have been calculated for ionization parameters ranging from 10\u22123.5 to 10\u22121.5 in steps of 100.5 and electron densities between 103.5 and 106 , also in steps of 100.5 .\nFor each combination of ionization parameter and density,\ntwo different metallicities (0.4Z\u2299 and Z\u2299 ) and two values\nof the spectral index of the power-law photoionizing continuum (\u22121 and \u22122) have been used. Grains were added to the\nsimulation and were adjusted to be similar to Orion grains.\nThe diagnostic diagram of [Feii]\u03bb1.257/Pa\u03b2 vs. [Oi]/H\u03b1\nis shown for Mkn 34 in Figure 8. This is the same diagram\nas presented in Figure 3 of Mouri et al. (2000). The trends\nin line ratio with ionization parameter, hydrogen density\nand slope of the ionizing continuum agree with previous\ndeterminations. In particular, an increase in ionization parameter causes decreases in both the [Feii]\u03bb1.257/Pa\u03b2 and\nthe [Oi]/H\u03b1 ratio of about the same magnitude, provided\nthat the slope of the ionizing continuum, is relatively steep\n(< \u22121.5); in practice, relatively steep continua are needed\nto fit these data.\nWe have already noted that the ratio between\n[Feii]\u03bb1.257 and the hydrogen recombination lines increases\nin the objects studied as one moves from the nuclear regions\nto the areas associated with radio lobe emission. In principle,\nif the sole mechanism operating is ionization by hard-UV\nradiation from an active nucleus, this change in line ratio\ncould be caused by a decrease in ionization parameter resulting from a geometrical dilution in the ionizing photon\n\n\fInfra-red spectra of Seyferts\n\nFigure 8. Diagnostic diagram of [Feii]\u03bb1.257/Pa\u03b2 vs. [Oi]/H\u03b1\ncompared to the observations of Mkn 34. Observational values\n(circles) within 2\u2032\u2032 either side of the nucleus are shown, and pixels\n<0.\u2032\u2032 4 from the nucleus are shown as solid blobs surrounded by\na circle. Model tracks from the cloudy program are also shown,\nfor various values of the ionizing continuum power-law slope (p),\nhydrogen density (n, in log10 cm\u22123 ). All tracks are calculated for\nZ = 0.4Z\u2299 . Within each track, the ionization parameter U varies\nfrom \u22121.5 to \u22123.5, with the higher values of [Feii]\u03bb1.257/Pa\u03b2\noccurring at lower U .\n\nflux or an increase in the electron density associated with\ncompression by the radio jet. This is indeed the conclusion of\nFalcke et al. (1998) who study the variation of the [Oiii]/H\u03b1\nratio and find that it decreases away from the nucleus. In\nthis case, however, one would also expect the [Oi]/H\u03b1 ratio\nto increase, and this does not seem to be the case (Figure\n8). In fact, this ratio is actually smaller in the southeastern lobe of Mkn 34, where the strongest interaction may be\ntaking place, than in the nucleus of Mkn 34. Since the [Oi]\nand [Feii] lines are produced in the same type of partially\nionized zone and in similar physical conditions, the lack of\ncorrelation between their ratios to hydrogen recombination\nlines is puzzling.\nThe same, however, does not appear to be the case in\nMkn 78. Whittle et al. (2005)'s extensive study of the extended optical emission lines in this object suggest that all\nlines, including [Oi], follow standard tracks from photoionization diagnostics, with a variation of about a factor of 10\nin U ; this is sufficient to produce a difference of about a\nfactor of 2 in [Feii]\u03bb1.257/Pa\u03b2.\nImages of some optical emission lines in the extended\nregions of NGC 5929 are presented by Bower et al. (1994)\nand discussed further by Su et al. (1996); however, we do not\nhave enough information on this object to present detailed\ndiagnostic diagrams comparable with previous work.\n4.2.2\n\nTentative detections of extended [Pii]\n\nA definitive test would be the detection of the [Pii] line in\nthe extended emission line region. In Figure 9 an extraction\nis shown of 0.\u2032\u2032 7 of the slit in the region where the [Feii] line is\nstrongest, just behind the southeastern radio lobe of Mkn 34.\n\n7\n\nFigure 9. (Bottom panel) Area around the [Pii] line in the six\npixels (0.\u2032\u2032 7) near the southeastern radio lobe of Mkn 34 with the\nstrongest [Feii] emission. The predicted [Pii] emission, deduced\nfrom scaling the [Feii] emission by the known wavelength ratio\nand by scaling in intensity by factors of 4 and 20, is shown by\ndotted lines. The wavelength scale is that of the observed frame in\nMkn 34. (Top panel) Combined extranuclear emission from near\nto the southeastern radio lobe of Mkn 34, as above, and the region\nof 0.\u2032\u2032 6 around the southwestern radio lobe of NGC 5929. Both of\nthese regions have enhanced [Feii] emission. The spectra have\nbeen coadded and corrected to the same wavelength scale by use\nof the [Feii] line. The predicted position of the [Pii] line is shown\nin each case; the dotted lines show the [Pii] line as it would appear\nif it were factors of 4 and 20 weaker than [Feii]. The wavelength\nscale is that of the observed frame of NGC 5929.\n\nThe [Feii] line in this region has been fitted with a Gaussian,\nand is shown shifted to the [Pii] wavelength and divided in\nintensity by factors of 4 and 20. There is a spike at exactly\nthe expected wavelength, although it is extremely close to\nthe noise level. If this is real, it clearly indicates that the\nmechanism operating in this extended region is photoionization, with little or no shock contribution. Unfortunately\nthe signal-to-noise in this spectrum is just too low to make\na definite statement.\nHowever, repeating this exercise in the extended region\nof NGC 5929 associated with the southwestern radio lobe\n(Figure 5) and in which the [Feii] is also enhanced over its\nvalue in the nuclear region, reveals a similar very marginal\n[Pii] detection in the extended emission. Adding the two together, with the appropriate scaling in wavelength (Figure 9)\ngives a more secure detection of the extended [Pii] at a level\nof about 0.2 times the strength of the extended [Feii] line.\nThis suggests, somewhat surprisingly, and despite the association with the radio jet, that the dominant mechanism of\nline excitation in these regions is still photoionization rather\nthan shock excitation.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA number of near-IR studies of Seyfert galaxies with extended optical emission have now been carried out, in particular Mkn 78 (Ramos Almeida et al. 2006 and this work),\nMkn 34 and NGC 1068 (Oliva et al. 2001). The picture which\nemerges with reasonable consistency is that the nuclear regions are almost certainly dominated by photoionization by\n\n\f8\n\nN. Jackson and R. J. Beswick\n\nUV photons, consistent with a mechanism involving the active nucleus. This is indicated both by the ability of photoionization to reproduce observed emission line ratios, and\nspecifically by the inconsistency of the [Feii]/[Pii] diagnostic with the enhanced ratios expected from shock models.\nIn the extended emission regions which coincide with radio\njets, there is a consistent pattern of changes in emission line\nratio consistent with compression of the gas by the bowshock associated with radio emission. Tentative detections\nof [Pii] in these regions, however, suggest that photoionization is still the dominant mechanism. The fact that the peak\nline emission is slightly behind the head of the radio jet in\nMkn 34 may suggest that the gas has been compressed by\nthe shocks but ionized by the active nucleus after the [Feii]\nhas been returned to the gas phase, rather than by UV and\nX-ray photons from the shocks themselves. In this case the\nfact that NGC 5929's peak of [Feii] is coincident with the radio lobe could indicate that the shock compression of the gas\nhas occurred more recently. It is important to confirm these\ndeterminations in other objects, using longer integrations on\nlarge (8-m class) telescopes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nBased on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities\nfor Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership:\nthe National Science Foundation (United States), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT\n(Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq\n(Brazil) and CONICET (Argentina).
