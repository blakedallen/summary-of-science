Using truncated convolution of perverse sheaves on a flag variety\nLusztig associated a monoidal category to a two sided cell in the Weyl group.\nWe identify this category in the case which was not decided previously.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet W be a finite irreducible crystallographic Coxeter group and let Irr(W ) be\nthe set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of W over Q. It is\nwell known that two irreducible representations of dimension 512 for W of type E7\nand four irreducible representations of dimension 4096 for W of type E8 behave\ndifferently from other elements of \u2294W Irr(W ) in many ways, see e.g. [Cu], [BL], [L1,\nTheorem 4.23] (see [L1, p. 109] for the definition of function \u2206). For this reason\nthe representations above are called exceptional. In this note we give one more\nexample of unusual behavior of exceptional representations or rather of associated\ngeometric objects.\nRecall that the group W is partitioned into two sided cells, W = \u2294c, see e.g. [L1,\np. 137]. We say that a two sided cell c is exceptional if the corresponding family\n(see [L1, 5.15, 5.25]) consists of exceptional representations of W . Thus there are\njust three exceptional two sided cells, one for W of type E7 and two for W of type\nE8 , see [L1, Chapter 4].\nWe fix an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero. Let G be a simple\nalgebraic group over C with the Weyl group W . Using truncated convolution of\nperverse K\u2212sheaves (in the classical topology) on the flag variety of G, Lusztig\nassociated to each two sided cell c \u2282 W a semisimple monoidal category P c (over\nK) , see [L4] and \u00a72.3 below. Moreover, Lusztig conjectured that there is a tensor\nequivalence P c \u2243 CohA(c) (Y \u00d7Y ) where A(c) is a finite group associated with family\ncorresponding to c in [L1, Chapter 4], Y is a finite A(c)-set and CohA(c) (Y \u00d7 Y )\nis the category of A(c)-equivariant sheaves on the set Y \u00d7 Y with convolution as a\ntensor product and a natural associativity constraint, see [L4, \u00a73.2]. This conjecture\nwas verified in [BFO1] for all non-exceptional two sided cells.\nLet c be an exceptional cell. Then A(c) = Z/2Z is the cyclic group of order\n2. The Lusztig's conjecture from [L4] predicts that we have a tensor equivalence\nP c \u2243 CohA(c) (Y \u00d7 Y ) where Y is a finite set with free A(c) = Z/2Z-action (the set\nY should be of cardinality 1024 if W is of type E7 and of cardinality 8192 if W is\nof type E8 ). Our main goal is to show that one needs to change the associativity\nconstraint a little bit in order to make this statement correct.\nDate: September 11, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nLet Y \u2032 be a finite set of cardinality 512 if W is of type E7 and of cardinality 4096\nif W is of type E8 (one can identify Y \u2032 with the set of Z/2Z-orbits on the set Y ).\nLet VecZ/2Z be the monoidal category of finite dimensional Z/2Z-graded spaces.\nThen there is a tensor equivalence CohZ/2Z (Y \u00d7 Y ) \u2243 VecZ/2Z \u22a0 Coh(Y \u2032 \u00d7 Y \u2032 ).\nThe category VecZ/2Z has two simple objects, the unit object 1 and one more\nsimple object \u03b4. Let Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z be the same as category VecZ/2Z but with modified\nassociativity constraint: for simple objects X, Y, Z the associativity constraint (X \u2297\nY ) \u2297 Z \u2243 X \u2297 (Y \u2297 Z) is the same as in the category VecZ/2Z if at least one of\nX, Y, Z is isomorphic to 1 and the associativity constraint (\u03b4 \u2297 \u03b4) \u2297 \u03b4 \u2243 \u03b4 \u2297 (\u03b4 \u2297 \u03b4)\nin Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z differs by sign from the one in VecZ/2Z . Here is our main result:\nTheorem 1.1. For an exceptional two sided cell c there is a tensor equivalence\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP c \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z \u22a0 Coh(Y \u00d7 Y ).\nRemark 1.2. (i) It will be clear from the proof that the category Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z \u22a0\nCoh(Y \u2032 \u00d7 Y \u2032 ) is not equivalent to VecZ/2Z \u22a0 Coh(Y \u2032 \u00d7 Y \u2032 ).\n(ii) Using the methods from [BFO1] one can show that for an exceptional two\n\u2032\nsided cell c one has either P c \u2243 VecZ/2Z \u22a0Coh(Y \u2032 \u00d7Y \u2032 ) or P c \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z \u22a0Coh(Y \u00d7\n\u2032\nY ). Thus our main result is just a computation of the sign in the associativity\nconstraint.\n(iii) Lusztig's construction of the category P c and our arguments extend with\ntrivial changes to the settings of D-modules (G is defined over an algebraically\nclosed field of characteristic zero) or l-adic sheaves (G defined over an algebraically\nclosed field in which l is invertible).\n(iv) There is an alternative definition of the category P c based on idea of\nA. Joseph. Namely, it is proved in [BFO2, Corollary 4.5(b)] that (D-module counterpart of) the category P c is tensor equivalent to certain subquotient of the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules with tensor product coming from the usual\ntensor product of bimodules.\n(v) The arguments in the proof of Theorem 1.1 extend to the case of monodromic\nsheaves on the flag variety as in [BFO1, \u00a75]. Thus we get a proof of statement in\n[BFO1, Remark 5.7].\nA direct computation of the associativity constraint in the category P c seems\nto be difficult. Thus our proof of Theorem 1.1 is indirect. Our main tool is the\ntheory of (unipotent) character sheaves developed by Lusztig [L3]. We use a commutator functor (see [BFO1, \u00a76]) from P c to the category of sheaves on the group\nG (values of this functor are direct sums of character sheaves on G). Our main\nobservation is that a commutator functor carries a canonical automorphism and\nkeeping track of the order of this automorphism is sufficient in order to distinguish\nbetween categories VecZ/2Z and Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z .\n2. Proofs\n2.1. Commutator functors. Let C be a monoidal category with associativity\nisomorphism a and let A be a category.\nDefinition 2.1. ([BFO1, \u00a76]) A commutator functor F : C \u2192 A is a functor\nendowed with a natural isomorphism uX,Y : F (X \u2297 Y ) \u2243 F (Y \u2297 X) such that the\n\n\fTENSOR CATEGORIES ATTACHED TO EXCEPTIONAL CELLS IN WEYL GROUPS\n\n3\n\nfollowing diagram commutes:\nF (X \u2297 (Y \u2297 Z))\nSSS\nl55\nSSSuX,Y \u2297Z\nSSS\nSSS\nSS))\nF ((Y \u2297 Z) \u2297 X))\n\nF (aX,Y,Zl)llll\n\nll\nlll\nlll\nF ((X \u2297 Y ) \u2297 Z)\nuX\u2297Y,Z\n\nF (aY,Z,X )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\nF (Y \u2297 (Z \u2297 X))\nF (Z \u2297 (X \u2297 Y ))\nSSS\nkk55\nSSFS(a\u22121\n)\nuZ\u2297X,Ykkkk\nSSZ,X,Y\nk\nSSS\nk\nSSS\nkkk\nkkk\n))\nF ((Z \u2297 X) \u2297 Y )\nRemark 2.2. It follows immediately from definition that uX,1 : F (X) \u2192 F (X) is\nan idempotent and hence an identity map.\nDefinition 2.3. The map u1,X : F (X) \u2192 F (X) is called canonical automorphism\nof the commutator functor F .\nRemark 2.4. It follows from definition that uY,X \u25e6 uX,Y = u1,X\u2297Y .\nRecall that a central functor G : A \u2192 C is a functor endowed with functorial isomorphism vA,X : G(A) \u2297 X \u2243 X \u2297 G(A) such that the following diagram\ncommutes:\nG(A) \u2297 (X \u2297 Y )\nSSS\nl55\nSSSvA,X\u2297Y\nSSS\nl\nl\nl\nSSS\nl\nl\nl\nSS))\nl\nl\nl\n(G(A) \u2297 X) \u2297 Y\n(X \u2297 Y ) \u2297 G(A)\naG(A),X,Y llll\n\nvA,X \u2297idY\n\naX,Y,G(A)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\n(X \u2297 G(A)) \u2297 Y\nX \u2297 (Y \u2297 G(A))\nSSS\nl55\nSSaSX,G(A),Y\nlll\nidX \u2297vA,Y\nSSS\nlll\nl\nSSS\nl\nll\nSS))\nlll\nX \u2297 (G(A) \u2297 Y )\nEquivalently, the structure of central functor on G is the same as factorization\nA \u2192 Z(C) \u2192 C where Z(C) is the Drinfeld center of C and Z(C) \u2192 C is the forgetful\nfunctor, see e.g. [ENO, \u00a72.3].\nProposition 2.5. ([BFO1, \u00a76]) Assume that the category C is rigid and has a\npivotal structure (that is an isomorphism of tensor functors Id \u2192 \u2217\u2217 ). Let (G, F )\nbe an adjoint pair of functors between C and A. Then the structures of commutator\nfunctor on F are in natural bijection with structures of central functor on G.\nProof. Assume that G has a central structure. Then\nHom(?, F (X \u2297 Y )) = Hom(G(?), X \u2297 Y ) = Hom(G(?) \u2297 \u2217 Y, X)\n\n= Hom(\u2217 Y \u2297 G(?), X) = Hom(G(?), \u2217\u2217 Y \u2297 X) = Hom(?, F (Y \u2297 X))\nand it is straightforward to check that the resulting isomorphism F (X \u2297 Y ) \u2243\nF (Y \u2297 X) satisfies the definition of commutator functor.\n\n\f4\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nConversely, assume that F has a commutator structure. Then\nHom(G(A) \u2297 X, ?) = Hom(G(A), ? \u2297 X \u2217 ) = Hom(A, F (? \u2297 X \u2217 ))\n\n= Hom(A, F (X \u2217 \u2297?)) = Hom(G(A), X \u2217 \u2297?) = Hom(X \u2297 G(A), ?)\nand it is straightforward to check that the resulting isomorphism G(A) \u2297 X \u2243\nX \u2297 G(A) satisfies the definition of central functor.\nFinally, one verifies that the two constructions above are mutually inverse. \u0003\nLet C be a pivotal category. Assume that the forgetful functor Z(C) \u2192 C has\na right adjoint functor Ind : C \u2192 Z(C). It follows from Proposition 2.5 that\nthe functor Ind has a canonical structure of commutator functor. Clearly, for any\nInd\nfunctor Z(C) \u2192 A the composition C \u2212\u2212\u2192 Z(C) \u2192 A has a structure of commutator\nfunctor. Moreover, we have the following universal property:\nCorollary 2.6. Let F : C \u2192 A be a commutator functor such that left adjoint of\nInd\nF exists. Then F factorizes as C \u2212\u2212\u2192 Z(C) \u2192 A. \u0003\nLet D be a ribbon category, for example Drinfeld center Z(C) of a spherical\ncategory C. Recall that there is a canonical automorphism \u03b8 of the identity functor\ncalled twist defined as following composition:\nX \u2192 \u2217\u2217 X \u2297 \u2217 X \u2297 X \u2192 \u2217\u2217 X \u2297 X \u2297 \u2217 X \u2192 \u2217\u2217 X = X.\n\nOne can rewrite this definition in terms of functor represented by X as follows:\nHom(?, X) = Hom(? \u2297 \u2217 X, 1) = Hom(\u2217 X\u2297?, 1) = Hom(?, \u2217\u2217 X).\n\nThus we have the following\n\nCorollary 2.7. The canonical automorphism of the commutator functor Ind : C \u2192\nZ(C) equals the twist automorphism. \u0003\nExample 2.8. (a) Let C = VecZ/2Z . It is well known that the category C is\nspherical (in two different ways) and the twist of any simple object of Z(C) is \u00b11\n(for any choice of the spherical structure). It follows that for any commutator\nfunctor F : C \u2192 A such that left adjoint of F exists the square of the canonical\nautomorphism is the identity map.\nhas two spherical structures and the\n(b) Let C = Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z . The category C \u221a\ntwists of simple objects of Z(C) are 1 and \u00b1 \u22121. Thus there exists a commutator\nfunctor F : C \u2192 A such that left adjoint of F exists and the square of the canonical\nautomorphism is not the identity map, for example F = Ind.\n2.2. Commutator functor \u0393 and its canonical automorphism. Let G be a\nsimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field and let B \u2282 G be a Borel\nsubgroup. The group B \u00d7 B acts on G via left and right translations. We consider\nthe subcategories CB\u00d7B and CG of the bounded derived category of constructible\nsheaves on G consisting of complexes that are isomorphic to a finite direct sum of\nshifts of simple, B \u00d7 B-equivariant (respectively, G-equivariant with respect to the\nadjoint action) perverse sheaves on G.\nWe recall now that the category CB\u00d7B has a natural monoidal structure with\ntensor product given by the convolution, see e.g. [L4, Section 1]. The group B\nacts freely on G \u00d7 G as follows: b * (x, y) = (xb, b\u22121 y). Let G \u00d7B G denote the\nquotient of G \u00d7 G by this action and let \u03c0 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G \u00d7B G be the natural\nprojection. Clearly, the multiplication map m(x, y) = xy is a well defined map\n\n\fTENSOR CATEGORIES ATTACHED TO EXCEPTIONAL CELLS IN WEYL GROUPS\n\n5\n\nm : G \u00d7B G \u2192 G.

It follows from the Decomposition Theorem\n(see [BBD]) that F1 \u2217 F2 \u2208 CB\u00d7B and it is clear that the convolution is a bifunctor.\nLet G \u00d7B G \u00d7B G be the quotient of G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G by the free B \u00d7 B-action via\n\u22121\n(b1 , b2 ) * (x, y, z) = (xb1 , b\u22121\n1 yb2 , b2 z) with obvious projection \u03c02 : G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G \u2192\nG \u00d7B G \u00d7B G and multiplication map m2 : G \u00d7B G \u00d7B G \u2192 G, m2 (x, y, z) = xyz.\nFor F1 , F2 , F3 \u2208 CB\u00d7B the convolutions (F1 \u2217 F2 ) \u2217 F3 and F1 \u2217 (F2 \u2217 F3 ) are both\ncanonically isomorphic to (m2 )! (F1 \u22a0^\nF2 \u22a0 F3 ) where F1 \u22a0^\nF2 \u22a0 F3 is the unique\n\u2217\n^\ncomplex on G \u00d7B G \u00d7B G such that \u03c02 (F1 \u22a0 F2 \u22a0 F3 ) = F1 \u22a0 F2 \u22a0 F3 . Identifying\n(F1 \u2217 F2 ) \u2217 F3 and F1 \u2217 (F2 \u2217 F3 ) via these isomorphisms we endow the category\nCB\u00d7B with associativity constraint satisfying the pentagon axiom. Moreover, CB\u00d7B\nis a monoidal category with unit object given by the constant sheaf on B \u2282 G.\nRemark 2.9. The indecomposable objects of the category CB\u00d7B are ICw [i] where\nICw is the intersection cohomology complex (see [BBD]) of the Bruhat cell corresponding to w \u2208 W and [i] stands for the shift. It is well known (see e.g. [L4,\n\u00a71.4]) that the (split) Grothendieck ring of the category CB\u00d7B identifies with Hecke\nalgebra; under this identification the objects ICw [i] correspond to the elements of\nKazhdan-Lusztig basis multiplied by i-th power of the Hecke algebra parameter.\nThere is an equivariantization functor \u0393 : CB\u00d7B \u2192 CG defined as follows (see\n \u0303 B G be the quotient of G\u00d7G by the following free B-action:\n[MV, Section 1]). Let G\u00d7\n \u0303 B G and\nb \u2299 (g, x) = (b\u22121 g, b\u22121 xb). We have a canonical projection \u03c0\u0303 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G\u00d7\n \u0303 B G \u2192 G, a(g, x) = g \u22121 xg. For F \u2208 CB\u00d7B let F\u0304 be\nthe adjoint action map a : G\u00d7\n \u0303 B G such that \u03c0\u0303 \u2217 F\u0304 = K \u22a0 F . We set \u0393(F ) := a! (F\u0304 ). It is\na unique complex on G\u00d7\nclear that \u0393(F ) is G-equivariant complex on G (with respect to the adjoint action)\nand the Decomposition Theorem (see [BBD]) implies that \u0393(F ) is semisimple. In\nother words, \u0393 is a functor CB\u00d7B \u2192 CG .\n\nRemark 2.10. We recall that irreducible constituents of perverse cohomology of\ncomplexes \u0393(F ) are by definition character sheaves (with trivial central character,\nor unipotent) on G, see [L3, Sections 2, 11] and [MV, Lemma 2.3].\n\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G)\nWe now define commutator structure on the functor \u0393. Let G\u00d7\nbe the quotient of G \u00d7 G \u00d7 G with respect to the following free B \u00d7 B-action:\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(b1 , b2 ) * (g, x, y) = (b\u22121\n1 g, b1 xb2 , b2 yb1 ). We have an obvious projection \u03c0\u03032 :\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G) and a well defined map a2 : G\u00d7\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G) \u2192 G,\nG \u00d7 G \u00d7 G \u2192 G\u00d7\na2 (g, x, y) = g \u22121 xyg. We have an obvious isomorphism \u0393(F1 \u2217F2 ) = (a2 )! (F1 \u22a0 F2 )\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G) such that \u03c0\u03032\u2217 (F1 \u22a0 F2 ) =\nwhere F1 \u22a0 F2 is a unique complex on G\u00d7\nK \u22a0 F1 \u22a0 F2 .\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G) \u2192 G\u00d7\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G),\nConsider the following (well defined) map \u03c1 : G\u00d7\n\u03c1(g, x, y) = (yg, y, x). For F1 , F2 \u2208 CB\u00d7B there is a unique isomorphism \u0169F1 ,F2 :\n\u03c1! (F1 \u22a0 F2 ) \u2243 F2 \u22a0 F1 inducing the identity map in every stalk (clearly, the stalks\n \u0303 B (G \u00d7B G) are canonically\nof both \u03c1!

Thus we have an\nisomorphism uF1 ,F2 : \u0393(F1 \u2217 F2 ) \u2243 \u0393(F2 \u2217 F1 ) defined as composition\n(a2 )! (\u0169F\n\n,F\n\n)\n\n1\n2\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 (a2 )!

(F1 \u22a0 F2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\nThe following result is straightforward:\n\n\f6\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nProposition 2.11. The functor \u0393 together with isomorphism u\u2022,\u2022 is a commutator\nfunctor CB\u00d7B \u2192 CG . \u0003\nThere is a canonical automorphism \u0398 of the identity functor of the category\nCG defined as follows (see [O2, Definition 2.1]): for any F \u2208 CG by definition of\nequivariance there is an isomorphism ad\u2217 (F ) \u2243 p\u2217 (F ) where p : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G is the\nsecond projection and ad : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G is the adjoint action map, ad(g, x) = g \u22121 xg;\ntaking pullback of this isomorphism with respect to the diagonal map \u2206 : G \u2192 G \u00d7\nG and noticing that \u2206 \u25e6 ad = \u2206 \u25e6 p = Id we get an automorphism \u0398F : F \u2192 F . In\nother words, the automorphism \u0398F at the stalk Fx is precisely ad(x) : Fx \u2243 Fx\u22121 xx .\nWe have the following\nProposition 2.12. The canonical automorphism of the commutator functor \u0393\nequals \u0398, that is u1,F = \u0398\u0393(F ) . \u0003\nRemark 2.13. Our construction of commutator structure on the functor \u0393 is just\na more explicit version of construction in [BFO1, \u00a76] (we will not need this fact in\nwhat follows). The advantage of the present version is that it makes Proposition\n2.12 easy.\n2.3. Truncated convolution and equivariantization. We recall (see e.g. [L1,\nChapter 5]) that the Weyl group W is partitioned into two sided cells, W = \u2294c.\nRemind that there is a partial order \u2264LR on the set of two sided cells. Let a(c)\ndenote the common value of Lusztig's a-function on w \u2208 W , see [L4, \u00a72.3].\nLet PB\u00d7B denote the full subcategory of CB\u00d7B consisting of perverse sheaves.\nc\nLet PB\u00d7B\ndenote the full subcategory of PB\u00d7B consisting of direct sums of perverse\nc\nsheaves ICw , w \u2208 c and let prc : PB\u00d7B \u2192 PB\u00d7B\nbe the obvious projection functor.\np\nLet H denote the perverse cohomology functor. Consider the following bifunctor\nc\nc\nc\nPB\u00d7B\n\u00d7 PB\u00d7B\n\u2192 PB\u00d7B\n:\nF1 \u229b F2 := prc (p H a(c) (F1 \u2217 F2 )).\nIt is explained in [L4, Section 2] that the associativity constraint of the convolution\ncategory CB\u00d7B restricts to the associativity constraint for the bifunctor \u229b. Morec\nc\nover, there exists the unit object 1c \u2208 PB\u00d7B\n(see [L4, \u00a72.9]), so the category PB\u00d7B\nhas a monoidal structure. We have the following result\nc\nProposition 2.14. ([BFO1, p. 222]) The monoidal category PB\u00d7B\nis rigid. Hence\nc\nPB\u00d7B is a multi-fusion category in a sense of [ENO, \u00a72.4]. \u0003\nc\nRemark 2.15. The Grothendieck ring of the category PB\u00d7B\nidentifies with Lusztig's\nasymptotic Hecke ring Jc , see [L4, \u00a72.6]. This together with [L1, Corollary 12.16]\nc\nimplies that the multi-fusion category PB\u00d7B\nis indecomposable in the sense of [ENO,\n\u00a72.4].\n\nLet PG be the full subcategory of CG consisting of direct sums of (unshifted)\nunipotent character sheaves, see Remark 2.10. It is known (see [L3, Section 16], [G,\n\u00a73.4]) that there is a unique direct sum decomposition (or, equivalently,\nL partition\nc\nwith\nof the set of isomorphism classes of unipotent character sheaves) PG = c PG\nthe following properties:\nL\nc\u2032\n(i) For w \u2208 c and i \u2208 Z we have p H i (\u0393(ICw )) \u2208\nc\u2032 \u2264LR c PG ; moreover\nL\n\u2032\nc\np i\nif |i| > a(c).\nH (\u0393(ICw )) \u2208 c\u2032 <LR c PG\n\n\fTENSOR CATEGORIES ATTACHED TO EXCEPTIONAL CELLS IN WEYL GROUPS\n\n7\n\nc\n(ii) For a simple perverse sheaf A \u2208 PG\nthere exists w \u2208 c such that A is a direct\np a(c)\nsummand of H\n(\u0393(ICw )).\nc\nLet pr\ne c denote the projection functor PG \u2192 PG\n. We consider the functor \u0393c :\nc p a(c)\nc\nc\nc\nPB\u00d7B \u2192 PG , \u0393 (F ) := pr\ne ( H\n(\u0393(F )). Notice that the property (ii) implies\nc\nthat the functor \u0393c is surjective, that is each simple object of PG\nappears as a direct\nc\nsummand of some \u0393 (F ). The properties above imply that the restriction of the\ncommutator structure of the functor \u0393 gives a well defined commutator structure\nuc of the functor \u0393c , see [BFO1, \u00a76]. We have\nc\nc\nProposition 2.16. The functor \u0393c : PB\u00d7B\n\u2192 PG\nis a surjective commutator\nfunctor with canonical automorphism \u0398.\n\nProof. We need only check the statement about the canonical automorphism of \u0393c .\nBy definition the object \u0393c (1c \u229bF ) is a direct summand of \u0393(1c \u2217F ). The canonical\nautomorphism of \u0393c (F ) = \u0393c (1c \u229bF ) equals the restriction of automorphism uF ,1c \u25e6\nu1c ,F of \u0393(1c \u2217 F ) to this direct summand. By Remark 2.4 the composition uF ,1c \u25e6\nu1c ,F equals the canonical automorphism of \u0393(1c \u2217 F ). Now the result follows from\nProposition 2.12.\n\u0003\n2.4. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Recall that c is an exceptional two sided cell. Let\nc\nP c = PB\u00d7B\n.\nThe following result follows easily from [Sh2, p. 347] (for W of type E7 ) and\n[Sh1, Proposition 3.6] (for W of type E8 ):\nProposition 2.17. Assume that c is an exceptional two sided cell. The category\nc\nPG\nhas 4 isomorphism classes\nof simple objects. The automorphism \u0398 acts as Id\n\u221a\non two of them and as \u00b1 \u22121Id on two others. \u0003\nIt follows from Proposition 2.16 that the canonical automorphism of the comc\nhas order 4.\nmutator functor \u0393c : P c \u2192 PG\nLet 1c = \u2295i 1i be the decomposition of the unit object 1c \u2208 P c into irreducible\nsummands. It is clear that {1i }i are orthogonal idempotents, that is 1i \u2297 1i \u2243 1i\nand 1i \u2297 1j = 0 if i 6= j. For any simple object X \u2208 P c there are unique i and\nj such that X = 1i \u2297 X \u2297 1j ; observe that i 6= j implies \u0393c (X) = 0 (indeed, in\nthis case \u0393c (X) = \u0393c (1i \u2297 X) = \u0393c (X \u2297 1i ) = \u0393c (0) = 0). Thus there exists i and\na simple object X = 1i \u2297\u221aX \u2297 1i \u2208 P c such that \u0393c (X) contains an irreducible\nsummand F with \u0398F = \u00b1 \u22121IdF . We fix such i.\nClearly 1i \u2297 P c \u2297 1i \u2282 P c is a tensor subcategory with unit object 1i and the\nrestriction \u0393c |1i \u2297P c \u22971i is a commutator functor. The choice of i guarantees that\nthe order of the canonical automorphism of \u0393c |1i \u2297P c \u22971i is 4. The Grothendieck\nring of the category 1i \u2297 P c \u2297 1i is computed in [L2, Corollary 3.12] (cf. Remark\n2.15); we see that this category has precisely 2 isomorphism classes of simple objects\n1i and \u03b4i , furthermore \u03b4i \u2297\u03b4i \u2243 1i . The following result is well known; it is a special\ncase of results of [S]:\nLemma 2.18. Let C be a fusion category with two (isomorphism classes of ) simple\nobjects: the unit object 1 and one more object \u03b4 such that \u03b4 \u2297 \u03b4 \u2243 1. Then either\nC \u2243 VecZ/2Z or C \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z . \u0003\nIn view of Example 2.8 we see that 1i \u2297 P c \u2297 1i can not be equivalent to VecZ/2Z\n(notice that the commutator functor \u0393c |1i \u2297P c \u22971i has the left adjoint since it is a\nfunctor between semisimple categories). Hence 1i \u2297 P c \u2297 1i \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z .\n\n\f8\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nLet C be a multi-fusion category and let e \u2208 C be a direct summand of the unit\nobject. Then e \u2297 C \u2297 e is a tensor subcategory of C and e \u2297 C is a module category\nover e \u2297 C \u2297 e via the left multiplication, see [O1]. Each object X \u2208 C gives rise\nto a functor ? \u2297 X : e \u2297 C \u2192 e \u2297 C commuting with the module structure above.\nThus we get a tensor functor from C to the category Fune\u2297C\u2297e (e \u2297 C, e \u2297 C) of\ne \u2297 C \u2297 e-module endofunctors of e \u2297 C. The following result is well known:\nLemma 2.19. Assume that multi-fusion category C is indecomposable. The functor\nabove is an equivalence C \u2243 Fune\u2297C\u2297e (e \u2297 C, e \u2297 C).\nProof. The category e\u2297C is a right module category over C and the obvious functor\ne \u2297 C \u2297 e \u2192 FunC (e \u2297 C, e \u2297 C) is an equivalence with the inverse functor F 7\u2192 F (e).\nIn the language of [O1, \u00a74.2], this means that the category e \u2297 C \u2297 e is dual to the\ncategory C. Now, the result follows by duality, see [O1, Corollary 4.1].\n\u0003\nThus we can reconstruct multi-fusion category C from smaller category e \u2297 C \u2297 e\nand module category e \u2297 C. We apply this to the case C = P c and e = 1i . It\nis well known (see e.g. [O1, Remark 6.2(iii)]) that the fusion category 1i \u2297 P c \u2297\n1i \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z has only one indecomposable semisimple module category, namely the\nc\nregular module category Vec\u03c9\n(M, M) where M is a\nZ/2Z . Hence P \u2243 FunVec\u03c9\nZ/2Z\ndirect sum of several copies of this module category (the number of indecomposable\nsummands in M equals the number of irreducible summands in 1c ). The same\n\u2032\n\u2032\nargument applies to the multi-fusion category Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z \u22a0 Coh(Y \u00d7 Y ) (in this case\nthe irreducible summands of the unit object are naturally labeled by the elements\nof the set Y \u2032 ). Thus choosing the set Y \u2032 of appropriate size we get\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP c \u2243 FunVec\u03c9Z/2Z (M, M) \u2243 Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z \u22a0 Coh(Y \u00d7 Y )\n\nand Theorem 1.1 is proved.\nc\nRemark 2.20. In [BFO2, Section 4] the category PG\nis endowed with tensor\nc\nstructure; moreover [BFO2, Theorem 5.3] states that PG \u2243 Z(P c ) and the functor\nc\n\u0393c is isomorphic to the induction functor Ind : P c \u2192 Z(P c ) \u2243 PG\n(one can use it\nto give a shorter proof of Theorem 1.1). This implies that for an exceptional cell c\nwe have P c \u2243 Z(Vec\u03c9\nZ/2Z ) (see [BFO2, Corollary 5.4(b)] for the case when c is not\nexceptional).\n\nReferences\n[BBD] A. Beilinson, J.
