First studied were the A-type stars (Rodgers et al. 1981; Lance 1988).\nSuch intermediate-age stars have most recently been studied by Preston and\nSneden (2000) and are likely to be blue stragglers. More recently, a number of\nOB stars have been found, also situated at vertical distances of up to several\nkpc from the plane (Conlon et al. 1989; Conlon et al. 1990; Conlon 1992;\nSchmidt et al. 1997; Ringwald et al. 1998). The shorter lifetimes of these stars\nexacerbate the problems of their interpretation in terms of the standard picture\nof star formation and galactic evolution. The most extreme examples, if they\noriginated in the plane, must have been ejected with velocities surpassing 1000\nkm/s, which clearly are unrealistically high values.\n\u2217 Instituto de Astronomia, UNAM, Apartado, Postal 70-264 04510, Mexico, D.F. email:\nchris@astroscu.unam.mx\n\u2020 KPNO/NOAO(Operated by AURA, Inc., under contract with the NSF), P.O.Box 26732,\nTucson, AZ 85726-6732, USA. email:kinman@noao.edu\n\n1\n\n\fDifferent mechanisms have been put forward to explain the existence of these\nstars, either within the conventional view, or postulating star formation in the\ngalactic halo itself (see for instance Lance 1988; or Tobin 1991, for extensive\nreviews). These mechanisms range from arguing that they are misidentified\nevolved or pathological stars, to postulating powerful ejection mechanisms for\nyoung, thin disk stars, or to proposing that they were formed in situ, in the\ngalactic halo, from a mixture of gas acquired while the Galaxy captured a small\nsatellite galaxy, or from collisions between cloudlets, or other possibilities.\nIt has become clear that the anomalous stars are quite a mixed bag themselves, and that, as a group, they undoubtedly contain some misidentified\nevolved stars, or some Population II stars posing as young B stars. But the\nyouth of quite a number of them seems well established, as shown by accurate\ndeterminations of surface gravities and colors, high resolution spectral studies, detailed abundance determinations, rotational velocities, etc. Among the\ngenuinely young OB stars far from the plane, it is also clear that no single mechanism is capable of explaining all cases. Extreme examples, like PG 1002+506,\na Be star with z > 10 kpc (Ringwald et al. 1998), PG 009+036, a rapidly\nrotating normal B star at z > 5 kpc (Schmidt et al. 1996), and others, are\nlikely to remain puzzling for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, Tobin (1991)\nconcludes that dynamical ejection from small clusters in the plane, as envisaged\nfor runaway stars by Poveda et al. (1967) and further studied by Gies end\nBolton (1986), Leonard and Duncan (1988,1990), and others, remains the most\nlikely explanation for many of the young stars at large distances from the plane.\nClearly, it is then of importance to determine for which stars this mechanism is\nthe likely explanation\n\n2\n\nA group of young stars far from the galactic\nplane\n\nAlthough there are many more examples of presumably young stars far from\nthe galactic plane scattered in the literature, for the purposes of this work\nwe will focus our attention on the relatively homogeneous group of 32 stars\nstudied by Conlon et al. (1990). The evidence for the youth of these stars\ncomes from detailed, high resolution abundance studies not only of elements of\nthe CNO group, but also of heavier elements. These determinations allow the\nauthors to conclude that their stars are bona fide, normal young B stars, and\nnot evolved, intermediate composition stars, or Population II stars mimicking\nthe spectroscopic characteristics of early type stars.\nBy means of a rudimentary estimation of the times of flight of these stars,\nassuming they were dynamically ejected from the plane, Conlon et al. conclude\nthat ejection is indeed the most likely mechanism to explain the majority of\nthem.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nOrbital analysis\n\nWe have obtained improved estimates of the times of flight by numerically integrating the galactic orbits of these stars. We have updated the proper motions\nof the Conlon et al. stars using Hipparcos data. Radial velocities were taken,\nwhen available, from the Hipparcos Input Catalogue; otherwise, they were calculated from the data given by Conlon et al. We used their values for the\ndistances. We then proceeded to numerically integrate the galactic orbit of\neach star. The galactic potential model of Allen and Santillan (1993) was used\nfor the integration of the orbits.\nFor each of the stars, times of flight since they left the galactic plane were\nobtained from the orbit computations. These times of flight were then compared\nwith the nuclear lifetimes of disk-composition stars using the models of Schaller\net al. (1992). The stellar masses determined by Conlon et al. were used. The\nresults of this analysis are summarized in Table 1. Successive columns contain\nthe Hipparcos number of the star, the time elapsed since it left the plane, the\nmass, the main sequence lifetime, the velocity of ejection from the plane, the\nestimated error in the computed times of flight, the times of flight if the stars\nformed at z = 700 pc, and finally, a code tagging the stars that can be explained\nby the ejection mechanism, or some variants thereof.\nTable 1 shows that for 24 out of the 32 stars the times of flight are smaller\nthan the nuclear lifetimes. It is clear, then, that these stars could indeed have\nbeen ejected from the plane. They are marked by a 'y' (for yes) in the last column of Table 1. The ejection velocities, also obtained from the orbital analysis,\nare shown in Column 5. Their values are quite reasonable, and compatible with\nthe ejection model. The errors in the times of flight, shown in Column 6, were\nestimated by computing two additional orbits for each star, with the initial conditions modified by the observational errors in distances, proper motions and\nradial velocities. The uncertainties in the times of flight are fairly small, and\nare largely due to the estimated errors in the distances.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nWe have shown that the dynamical ejection mechanism is a plausible alternative\nto explain the majority of the stars in Table 1. However, for 8 stars the times of\nflight are larger than the nuclear lifetimes, and these stars do not have time to\nreach the z-distances at which they are observed. We could pose the question\nas to whether there are ways to prolong the nuclear lifetimes of massive stars.\nOne obvious possibility is rapid rotation, which will induce mixing. However,\nmodels calculated with rotation increase the nuclear lifetimes by at most 20\npercent (Meynet and Maeder 2000). So, rotation would solve the problem only\nfor three additional stars. They are marked by an 'r' in the last column of Table\n1.\n\n3\n\n\fAnother possibility we can explore is star formation not on the galactic\nplane, but a few hundreds of parsecs above or below it. Such a mechanism was\nproposed by Martos et al. (2000), and is a result of the passage through the disk\nof a spiral density wave, which can eject sheets of gas to distances of up to 800\npc from the plane. After the spiral density wave passes, the gas will fall back\nonto the plane; however, in certain cases, Martos et al. showed that conditions\nare favorable for star formation while the ejected gas is still far from the plane.\nWe can envisage that, as occurs in the plane, star formation will result not in\nsingle stars being born, but rather multiples or small clusters, within which the\ndynamical ejection mechanism could take place. We would then have runaway\nstars being produced not at z = 0 but at z = 500-800 pc.\nReturning to the orbital analysis, we can determine the times of flight not\nsince the star left the plane, but since the star left a region situated 700 pc\nabove or below the plane, where it could have formed according to the Martos\net al. scheme. Such times of flight are, of course, shorter than the times of flight\nfrom the plane, and could be shorter than the nuclear lifetimes of the problem\nstars. The stars for which this is the case are marked by an 'f' (for birth far\nfrom the plane). There is a total of five stars for which formation away from\nthe plane, as in the Martos et al. scheme, would make the ejection mechanism\na plausible alternative.\nTo sum up our results, the last column of Table 1 shows that taking into\naccount both the increase in the nuclear lifetimes than can result from stellar\nrotation, and star formation away from the plane, 29 out of the 32 stars can\nbe explained by the dynamical ejection mechanism. This leaves, however, three\nstars for which another explanation is necessary.\n\nReferences\nAllen, C., Santillan, A. (1993). Rev. Mexicana Astron.
