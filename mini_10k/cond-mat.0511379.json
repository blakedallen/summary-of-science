Introduction\n\nMany crucially important processes in biology involve the translocation of a\nbiopolymer through nanometer-scale pores, such as DNA and RNA translocation\nacross nuclear pores, protein transport through membrane channels, and virus\ninjection.1-3 Due to various potential technological applications, such as rapid DNA\nsequencing,4-5 gene therapy and controlled drug delivery,6 polymer translocation has\nbeen the subject of a number of experimental,7-17 theoretical17-35 and numerical\nstudies.32-43 In order to overcome a large entropic barrier typical to polymer\ntranslocation and to speed up the translocation, an external driving force is needed,\nsuch as an electric field, chemical potential difference, or selective adsorption on one\nside of the membrane. There have also been several theoretical studies on chain\ntranslocation in the presence of binding particles.28,29,43\nThe nanopore detection and analysis of single molecules is based on the working\nprinciple of a Coulter counter.44 When a particle passes through a nanopore, the\nelectrolyte in the solution is displaced, resulting in blockades in the ionic current. The\nmagnitude of these blockades is roughly proportional to the volume of the particle.\nKasianowicz et al.7 demonstrated that an electric field can drive single-stranded DNA\n(ssDNA) and RNA molecules through the water-filled \u03b1-hemolysin channel and that\nthe passage of each molecule is signaled by a blockade in the channel current. The\ntranslocation process includes two essential steps. First, one end of the polymer enters\nthe pore directed by diffusion and by the action of an electric field near the pore.\n\n2\n\n\fSecond, the polymer is translocated from one side of the membrane to the other,\ndriven by the electric field. For the first step, the experimental results show that the\nability of the polymer to enter the nanopore depends linearly on polymer\nconcentration.7,10 For the second step, the translocation time is highly sensitive to the\npolynucleotide sequence of ssDNA and RNA and secondary structure of RNA.8 As to\nthe dependence of the polymer translocation on the chain length, two regimes are\nfound, depending on the polymer length.11 For long polymers, the mean translocation\ntime appears to be linear with the chain length,7,11 while it decreases rapidly with\ndecreasing chain length in a nonlinear way.11 In addition, an inverse linear and a\ninverse quadratic dependence of the translocation time on applied voltage are\nobserved for different experiments.7,11\nOnly a limited voltage range can be applied across a biological pore. Furthermore,\nthere are difficulties in analyzing the current variations because the shot noise is\ncomparable to the expected signal. Recently, solid-state nanopores have been used for\nsimilar experiments.14-17 Storm et al.17 carried out a set of experiments on\ndouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules with various lengths that translocate\nthrough a solid-state nanopore. Surprisingly, a power-law scaling of the most probable\ntranslocation time with the polymer length was observed with an exponent of 1.27, in\ncontrast to the linear behavior observed for the experiments on \u03b1-hemolysin\nchannel.7,11\nThus existing theories17,19,22,33 provide different predictions for the scaling\nbehavior of the translocation time as a function of polymer length, ranging from\n\n3\n\n\f\u03c4 \u223c N to \u03c4 \u223c N 1+\u03bd , where \u03bd is the Flory exponent.45,46 Moreover, they do not agree\nwith the recent experimental finding17 that \u03c4 \u223c N 1.27 . To clarify these issues, here we\nperform numerical simulation studies based on a 2D fluctuating bond lattice model for\npolymers to investigate the translocation dynamics under an external driving field\nwithin the pore. As our main result, we find that for short nanopores, the translocation\ntime crosses over from N 2\u03bd to N 1+\u03bd with increasing chain length. In 3D, the\nexponent45,46 2\u03bd =1.18, which is in reasonably good agreement with the experimental\nresult of 1.27. We demonstrate that the crossover is due to a change in the\ntranslocation velocity of the polymer as a function of the chain length. Finally, we\nalso discuss the influence of the pore length on forced translocation.\nII. The Fluctuating Bond Model\n\nThe fluctuating bond (FB) model47 with single-segment Monte Carlo (MC)\nmoves is an efficient model to study various static and dynamic properties of\npolymers. Here, we consider the two-dimensional (2D) lattice FB polymer model for\nMC simulations of a self-avoiding polymer, where each segment excludes four\nnearest and next nearest neighbor sites on a square lattice. The bond lengths bl are\nallowed to vary in the range 2 \u2264 bl \u2264 13 in units of the lattice constant, where the\nupper limit prevents bonds from crossing each other. With these restrictions each\nsegment can occupy 36 different lattice sites and there are 28 different bond angles\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 [ 0, \u03c0 ) , thus yielding a reasonable approximation for continuum behavior.\nThe external driving force in the present work was modeled as a potential\ndifference applied linearly across the length of the pore with the profile in the manner\n\n4\n\n\fdescribed by Chern et al.36\nE L\n\u23a7\n, x>L 2\n\u2212\n\u23aa\nk BT 2\n\u23aa\n\u23aa E\n2\nx, L 2 \u2265 x \u2265 \u2212 L 2 and y 2 \u2264 (W 2 )\nU e \u23aa\u2212\n= \u23a8 k BT\n,\nk BT \u23aa\nE L\n\u23aa\n, x < \u2212L 2\nk BT 2\n\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u221e, Otherwise\n\u23a9\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L and W are the length and width of the pore, respectively, and E is the strength\nof the external field.\nDynamics is introduced by Metropolis moves of a single segment, with a\nprobability of acceptance min[ e \u2212\u2206U e\n\nk BT\n\n,1], where \u2206U e is the energy difference\n\nbetween the new and old states. As to an elementary MC move, we randomly select a\nmonomer and attempt to move it onto an adjacent lattice site (in a randomly selected\ndirection). If the new position does not violate the excluded-volume or maximal\nbond-length restrictions, the move is accepted or rejected according to Metropolis\ncriterion. N elementary moves constitute one MC time step (MCS). In the FB model,\neach effective monomer corresponds to several real chemical monomers along the\nbackbone of the chain. Each segment separating two adjacent effective monomers has\na physical meaning corresponding approximately to the Kuhn length a which\nmeasures the length scale at which the polymer is stiff and not flexible.\nIII. Results and discussion\n\nTo begin the simulation of translocation of the polymer through the pore, a chain\nis placed on one side of the pore with one end of it in the pore entrance. Then the\nchain is allowed to reach an equilibrium state using MC moves, but with the\n\n5\n\n\fconstraint that the first monomer is fixed. Once the polymer is in its equilibrium state,\nthe first monomer at the entrance of the pore is released, and that moment is\ndesignated as \u03c4 = 0. The translocation time \u03c4 is defined as the duration of time taken\nfor the chain to move through the pore in the direction of the driving force. In our\nsimulations, the pore width is fixed as two lattice units unless otherwise stated.\nA. Polymer translocation through a short nanopore\n1. Influence of the electric field strength on translocation time\n\nTo determine how translocation time depends on the electric field strength E/kBT,\nwe considered a polymer chain of length N = 75. The length and the width of the pore\nwere chosen as 3 and 2 lattice units, respectively. It is important to note that not all\nthe simulation runs result in a successful translocation and even when they do, the\ntranslocation times vary over a wide range of values. We define the translocation time\n\n\u03c4 as the average time over all successful runs. For the present case where the driving\nforce is relatively strong, the distribution of translocation times is narrow without a\nlong tail and symmetric with respect to the most probable translocation time, as noted\nby Kantor and Kardar.33 Therefore, the average is well defined. With increasing\nelectric field the translocation time decreases rapidly for weak fields and saturates to a\nconstant value for strong fields, as shown in Fig.1. This is because the electric field\ninteracts with the polymer only inside the pore and therefore within our model, the\ntranslocation rate has a finite maximum. For weak fields, we find that \u03c4 \u223c E \u22120.83\u00b1 0.01 ,\nwhich is in agreement with the experiments of Kasianowicz et al.7 who found that the\nchannel blockade life time was inversely proportional to the applied voltage. By\n\n6\n\n\fcontrast, Meller et al.11 found an inverse quadratic dependence of apparent\ntranslocation velocities on the applied field.\n2. Numerical results for a crossover scaling behavior of \u03c4 with N\n\nNext, we consider the influence of the chain length on translocation for the short\npore case (L = 3). Fig.2 shows the dependence of \u03c4 on N for two different fields. One\nof the main features is that there is a crossover for both cases. For a smaller chain of\nlength N < 200, \u03c4 \u223c N 1.46\u00b1 0.01 is observed. This exponent is close to 2\u03bd, where \u03bd =\n0.75 is the Flory exponent for a self-avoiding walk in 2D. For longer chains of length\nN > 300, the slopes become 1.70 and 1.72, which is in good agreement \u03bd + 1 = 1.75.\nWith increasing the width of the pore from 2 to 5 lattice units, we observed the same\nexponents and crossover behavior. Thus, we conclude that for smaller chain length,\ntranslocation time vs. polymer chain length satisfies \u03c4 \u223c N 2\u03bd and it crosses over to\n\n\u03c4 \u223c N 1+\u03bd for larger N independent of the strength of the field. A crossover of \u03c4 as a\nfunction of N has also been reported in very recent Langevin dynamics simulations.48\nOur results are in contrast with the experimental data that \u03c4 depends linearly on N\nin the case of \u03b1-hemolysin,7-11 but the predicted short chain exponent 2\u03bd = 1.18 in 3D\nagrees reasonably well with the solid-state nanopore experiments of Storm et al.17,\nwho found an exponent of 1.27. The ssDNA is a flexible polymer and the Kuhn\nlength a ~ 1 \u2212 5nm ~ 2 \u2212 10bp (base pairs),49,50 while the dsDNA is a semi-flexible\npolymer and typically a ~ 100nm ~ 340bp.51,52 The beginning of the crossover region\noccurs at N = 200 which corresponds to real lengths of the ssDNA and the dsDNA\nabout 400 \u2212 2kbp and 68kbp, respectively. These lengths are beyond or near the\n\n7\n\n\flongest ssDNA and dsDNA used in the experiments so far.7,11,17 Thus, it is not\nsurprising that crossover in scaling behavior has not been experimentally observed\nyet.\n3. Comparison with theoretical scaling predictions\n\nA number of recent theories17-35 have been developed for the dynamics of\npolymer translocation. Sung and Park19 considered equilibrium entropy of the\npolymer as a function of the position of the polymer through the nanopore. Under the\ninstantaneous equilibrium approximation during the translocation process, the\ntranslocation problem is reduced to the escape of a ''particle'' over an entropic barrier.\nThe limiting case of an extremely long chain, and an infinitely thin membrane and\nnarrow pore was considered. For a Gaussian chain under an external force, it is shown\nthat \u03c4 \u223c N D , where D is the relevant diffusion coefficient. Muthukumar22 suggested\nthat D is not that of the whole chain, but rather the diffusion coefficient of the\nmonomer that just passes the pore, and hence it is a constant independent of N. As a\nresult, a linear dependence \u03c4 \u223c N is obtained under a strong field. This is in\nagreement with some experimental results7,11 for polymer translocation through\n\u03b1-hemolysin channel. In addition, there is support for the linear scaling behavior from\nthe 3D Gaussian chain MC simulations of Chern et al.36 and Langevin dynamics\nsimulations for relatively short polymers.37,42 However, the above theories cannot\nexplain the recent experimental result, namely that \u03c4 \u223c N 1.27 for polymer translocation\nthrough a solid-state nanopore.17 Incidentally, according to our present results in the\nshort chain limit, \u03c4 scales as N 2\u03bd which would also yield a linear scaling result for\n\n8\n\n\fthe Gaussian chain since 2\u03bd = 1 in this case.\nKardar et al.32,33 have argued that the assumption of equilibrium in Brownian\npolymer dynamics by Sung and Park,19 and Muthukumar22 breaks down when the\ntranslocation time is shorter than the equilibration time for the polymer, which occurs\nfor a self-avoiding polymer in the long chain limit. For a Gaussian polymer, the\nequilibrium assumption is marginal even in the absence of driving field. Instead, a\nlower bound for translocation time was obtained by considering the unimpeded\nmotion of a polymer that best mimics the situation with a chemical potential\ndifference applied across the pore.33 Absent the restrictions imposed by the pore in the\nmembrane, a force applied to a single monomer exists at the spatial position where the\npore resides. Because the monomer to which the force is applied changes constantly,\nit was assumed that there is no incentive for a drastic change in the shape of the\npolymer and the scaling of the size remains the same, independent of \u2206\u03bc . At each\nmoment a force is applied to the polymer. The drift velocity u of the polymer due to\nthe\n\napplied\n\nforce\n\nF\n\ncan\n\nu ( F ) \u223c ( Rg \u03c4 r ) \u03c6 ( FRg k BT ) \u223c N\n\nbe\n\nwritten\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nscaling\n\nform\n\nas32\n\n\u03c6 ( FN \u03bd ) , where Rg is the radius of gyration\n\n\u2212(1+\u03bd )\n\nwhich scales as Rg \u223c N \u03bd , and \u03c4 r is the relaxation time of the polymer that scales as\n\n\u03c4 r \u223c N 1+ 2\u03bd for Rouse dynamics. If u is proportional to the force, the scaling function\n\u03c6 is linear and thus the mobility u F scales 1/N. They thus conclude that the time\nfor such unhindered motion scales as33\n\n\u03c4 ( \u2206\u03bc ) \u223c\n\nRg\nu\n\n\u223c\n\nN 1+\u03bd\n,\n\u2206\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nThis provides a lower bound for the scaling of the translocation time which agrees\n9\n\n\fwith our numerical results for large N. The fact that the numerical study of Kantor and\nKardar did not yield the scaling form N 1+\u03bd was attributed to the fact that the large N\nlimit has not been reached yet.33\nFor the shorter polymers, the situation under an electric field driving force is\ndifferent. In this case, the equilibrium radius of gyration Rg is not an appropriate\nvariable for the scaling form, since the shape of the polymer can be greatly distorted\nby the applied field. Instead, if we denote by N trans ( t ) the number of segments that\nhave passed through the pore, we can write a scaling form for\n\ndN trans ( t )\nas\ndt\n\nsuggested in Refs. 32 and 34:\ndN trans ( t )\ndt\n\n\u221d\n\nN \u239b \u2206\u03bc N \u239e\n1\u2212 2\u03bd\n\u03c6\u239c\n\u239f \u221d N \u2206\u03bc ,\n\u03c4 r \u239d k BT \u23a0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bc is the chemical potential difference between two sides of the membrane.\nIntegrating both sides from the beginning to the end of the translocation process\nyields the result for the scaling of the translocation time as\n\n\u03c4 \u223c N 2\u03bd ,\n\n(4)\n\nin agreement with our result for short chains. We note that the same scaling law in\nEq.(4) was recently derived by Storm et al.17 based on force balance between the\ndriving force and the hydrodynamic friction experienced by the polymer. They thus\nattributed their experimentally observed non-linear scaling to hydrodynamic\ninteraction. However, further theoretical and numerical support for their argument is\ncurrently missing. The effect of hydrodynamic interaction on polymer translocation is\nnontrivial and will be investigated in future work.\n\n10\n\n\f4. Crossover behavior of translocation time\n\nAlthough the above scaling arguments support our numerical results for small and\nlarge N, the crossover scaling behavior cannot be understood based on these\narguments. Theoretically, we need to answer two questions: Does Rg remain constant\nduring the translocation under an external field, and is the translocation velocity really\ninversely proportional to N for a wide range of N?\nTo study these assumptions, we have numerically calculated Rg during the\ntranslocation process for L = 3 and W = 2, as shown in Fig. 3. For both N = 100 and N\n= 500, during translocation Rg first increases and reaches a maximum, and then\ndecreases with time. The same behavior was verified even for a relatively wide pore\nwith W = 200. In addition, there is a slight asymmetry of Rg with time in that it is\nsomewhat larger before the translocation than immediately after it. This indicates that\nthe chain remains in a non-equilibrium state, and the assumption that there is no\ndrastic change in the shape of the polymer during the translocation is invalid.\nTo study this issue in detail, we calculated the average initial horizontal distance\nbetween the last monomer of the polymer and the wall R0 as shown in Fig. 4.\nAccording to the definition of the translocation time, at the completion of the\ntranslocation process, the chain has moved a distance of R0 along the direction parallel\nto the axis of the pore. Here we should point out that R0 is the component of an\nend-tethered chain along the pore and we thus have\ntranslocation velocity as53 v =\n\nR0\n\n\u03c4\n\nR0 \u223c N \u03bd . We now define the\n\n. For a crossover scaling behavior of \u03c4 with N ,\n\nthe scaling of v with N must have a crossover, too. According to our numerical results,\n11\n\n\fwe must have that\n\u23a7 N\u03bd\n\u223c N \u2212\u03bd\nN \u03bd \u23aa\u23aa N 2\u03bd\n\u223c\u23a8 \u03bd\nv\u223c\n\u03c4\n\u23aa N \u223c N \u22121\n\u23aa\u23a9 N 1+\u03bd\n\nfor small N\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nfor large N\n\nFigure 5 shows the influence of the chain length on the translocation velocity. As\nexpected, there is a crossover. For N > 200, we find v ~ N -0.97, where the exponent is\nindeed close to \u22121. For N < 200, we find v ~ N -0.63. This is in reasonably good\nagreement with \u2212\u03bd = \u22120.75.\nThe reason why the translocation velocity slows down for large N can be seen in\nFig.6, which shows the chain configurations for N = 100 and 600 just at the moment\nafter translocation. The density of segments near the pore is much higher for a long\nchain than for a short chain. At the late stages of translocation, the high density of\nsegments near the pore slows down the translocation velocity. The translocation time\nis much shorter than the Rouse relaxation time for a self-avoiding chain, and thus Fig.\n6 demonstrates the fact that the polymer remains in a non-equilibrium state, as the\ntranslocated segments do not have enough time to diffuse away from the vicinity of\nthe pore.\n5. Waiting times for monomers\n\nAn important issue from the experimental point of view concerns the dynamics of\nsingle monomers passing through the nanopore during translocation. The\nnon-equilibrium nature of the driven translocation problem should have a significant\neffect on this. To this end, we numerically calculated the average waiting time for\neach monomer to pass through the pore. This is defined as the time duration between\n12\n\n\fthe events when monomers s and s + 1 exit the pore. In Fig. 7 we show the results for\ntwo chain lengths. There is strong dependence of the waiting time on the position of\nthe monomer in the chain. For N = 100, the longest waiting time approximately\ncorresponds to the middle monomer of the chain. However, for N = 400,\napproximately the 300th monomer needs the longest time to thread the pore, which\nindicates that during late stages of translocation the high density of segments of a long\npolymer near the pore slows down the translocation. For sequencing DNA, one\nexpects to distinguish monomers one by one according to the blockade of current and\nthe waiting time. From our numerical results, even for identical monomers, the\nwaiting times are different and are determined by the monomer positions in the chain.\nFor heteropolymers, it thus becomes very difficult to distinguish based on the waiting\ntime how many monomers of the same kind are connected together in the chain,\nwhich is very important for successful sequencing DNA.\nB. Polymer translocation through a long nanopore\n\nIn this section, we discuss the influence of the pore length on translocation\ndynamics. Here we fixed the field strength to be E/kBT = 5, which means that the\nvoltage drop increases with increasing the pore length. Fig. 8(a) shows the\ntranslocation time as a function of the chain length for different pore lengths L. For\n\nR L\n\n1 , where R is the radius of gyration along the pore, the asymptotic scaling\n\n\u03c4 \u223c N 1+\u03bd is recovered for all L. However, for a smaller ratio of R L the situation is\nmore complicated. For L = 6, scaling follows the previous short pore result \u03c4 \u223c N 2\u03bd\nas expected, while for longer pores there is no obvious power law scaling. Our data\n\n13\n\n\falso indicate that translocation times decrease rapidly with decreasing chain length in\na nonlinear way for short polymers, which is in good agreement with the experimental\nresults.11 The dependence of \u03c4 on L is shown in Fig. 8(b). For relatively short\npolymers, \u03c4 increases with increasing L, while it is independent of L for long\npolymers. On one hand, with increasing L the voltage drop increases, which leads to a\nfaster translocation. On the other hand, with increasing L the polymer needs to move a\nlonger distance, which results in a longer translocation time. For long enough\npolymers, the cancellation of these two factors leads to the lack of dependence of \u03c4 on\nL.\n\nNext, we fixed EL/2kBT = 2, which means that the voltage drop across the pore\ndoes not change with the length of the pore. Fig.9 shows \u03c4 as a function of the pore\nlength L for different chain lengths. It can be seen that \u03c4 increases with increasing L.\nThis is because the field decreases and the distance that the polymer has to move\nincreases with increasing L.\nIn our previous work,35 in the absence of an external driving force we considered\na polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore and studied the escape\ntime \u03c4e required for the polymer to completely exit the pore on either end. We showed\nthat \u03c4e has a minimum as a function of L when the radius of gyration along the pore\nR \u2248 L . To study whether or this still holds for the forced case, we investigated the\n\ninfluence of driving on \u03c4e as a function of L with constant voltage drop, as shown in\nFig. 10. The width of the pore is W = 7 here. For a weak field of EL/2kBT = 0.05, we\nstill observe the \"optimal\" pore length for minimum passage time in agreement with\n\n14\n\n\four previous results35 for EL/2kBT = 0. However, the minimum in the escape time\nrapidly vanishes with increasing field such that for EL/2kBT = 0.1, \u03c4e already changes\ninto a monotonously increasing function of L.\n\nIV Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we have investigated the problem of polymer translocation through\na nanopore under an electric field based on the 2D fluctuating bond model with\nsingle-segment Monte Carlo moves. We examined the influence of the field strength,\nchain length and pore length on translocation dynamics. As our main result, we have\nfound a crossover scaling for the translocation time with chain length from \u03c4 \u223c N 2\u03bd\nfor relatively short polymer to \u03c4 \u223c N 1+\u03bd for longer polymers. With increasing N,\nthere is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore due to slow relaxation of\nthe chain, which slows down the translocation process. We demonstrated that the\nchange in the dependence of the translocation velocity v on the chain length\ndetermines this crossover behavior. For relatively short polymers v \u223c N \u2212\u03bd , which\ncrosses over to v \u223c N \u22121 for long chains. In addition, we also examined the\ntranslocation through a long pore for constant field strength. For short polymers, i.e.,\nwhere Rg along the pore direction is less than the pore length, translocation times\ndecrease rapidly with decreasing chain length in a nontrivial way. In the long polymer\nlimit, the scaling relation \u03c4 \u223c N 1+\u03bd is recovered. Finally, we have also shown that for\na polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore, there exists a minimum\nin the escape time, which occurs at R \u2248 L , provided that the applied field is\n\n15\n\n\fsufficiently weak such that EL is less than some critical value. For larger EL, the\nescape time becomes a monotonously increasing function of the pore length.\n\nAcknowledgments: This work has been supported in part by a Center of Excellence\n\ngrant from the Academy of Finland.
