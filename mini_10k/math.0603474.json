Introduction\nConsider a separable Hilbert space H, which could be finite or infinite dimensional, and\na Stochastic Differential Inclusion of the form:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 dXt \u2208 (AXt \u2212 \u2202U (Xt ))) dt + dWt ,\n(1.1)\n\uf8f3\nX0 (x) = x \u2208 H,\n\nwhere A is self-adjoint in H, U : H 7\u2192] \u2212 \u221e, +\u221e] is convex and lower semi-continuous\nwith sub-differential \u2202U and W a cylindrical white noise in H.\nWe recall that, if U is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable on H, then \u2202U coincides with the gradient\n\u2207U . For general convex U , the subdifferential \u2202U (x) at x \u2208 H is the set {y \u2208 H : U (\u03be) \u2265\nU (x) + hy, \u03be \u2212 xi, \u2200 \u03be \u2208 H} and the differential inclusion (1.1) is a formal way of writing\nwhich needs to be made precise. Notice that \u2202U (x) is a non empty closed convex set for\nall x such that U (x) < \u221e and there exists an element of minimal norm \u22020 U (x).\nIf \u2207U is Lipschitz-continuous, then existence and uniqueness of the SDE (1.1) is well\nknown under suitable conditions on A. Moreover, in this case X is reversible with respect\nto a probability measure \u03bd := Z1 e\u22122U d\u03bc, where \u03bc is the Gaussian measure N (0, (\u22122A)\u22121 )\nand X can be characterized as the diffusion process in H associated with the Dirichlet\nform obtained closing in L2 (H, \u03bd) the symmetric bilinear form:\nZ\n1\nE(\u03c6, \u03c8) :=\n(1.2)\nh\u2207\u03c6, \u2207\u03c8iH d\u03bd,\n\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cb1 (H).\n2\nIn this paper we consider a sequence of processes X n , solving (1.1) for some choice of\n(H, A, U, W ) = (Hn , An , Un , Wn ), and we give conditions under which X n converges to a\nsolution of (1.1) for some choice of (H\u221e , A\u221e , U\u221e , W\u221e ). More precisely, we adopt here the\nDirichlet form setting, and consider X n associated with E n for some choice of (Hn , \u03bd n )\nin (1.2) and we give conditions for convergence of X n to a process X associated with\nE for some choice of (H, \u03bd). Our result includes pointwise convergence of the transition\nsemigroups P n of X n to the transition semigroups P of X.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLORENZO ZAMBOTTI\n\nAn important example of this situation is the following: consider the Yosida approximations of U :\n\b\n(1.3)\nUn (x) := inf U (y) + n kx \u2212 yk2 .\ny\u2208H\n\nThen it is well known that Un is smooth and Un , respectively \u2207Un , converge to U , resp.\n\u22020 U . An interesting particular case is:\n\u001a\n0\nx\u2208K\nU (x) :=\n(1.4)\n+\u221e\nx\u2208\n/K\n\nwhere K \u2282 H is a non-empty closed convex set. However we have several other interesting\napplications in mind besides Yosida approximations: see the end of this introduction.\nThere is an extensive literature on equations of the type (1.1). If H = Rd is finitedimensional, then well-posedness and existence of strong solutions of (1.1) even with more\ngeneral drift and diffusion coefficients has been established by C\u00e9pa in [11]. If dim H = \u221e,\nthen Da Prato and R\u00f6ckner prove well-posedness of (1.1) in the class of weak solutions: see\n[8]. However, in the latter paper, \u2207U is assumed to satisfy suitable integrability conditions,\nand in particular the interesting case (1.4) is not covered.\nNotice also that (1.1) is naturally associated with the following second-order elliptic\noperator:\n1\n\u2200 x \u2208 D(A),\n(1.5)\nL\u03c6(x) := Tr[D 2 \u03c6(x)] + hAx, \u2207\u03c6(x)i \u2212 h\u22020 U (x), \u2207\u03c6(x)i,\n2\nwhere \u03c6 is a smooth test-function. Da Prato, starting with the paper [6], has investigated\nthe analytical properties of L in a suitable L2 (H, \u03bc) space, where the probability measure\n\u03bc makes L essentially self-adjoint. The same analytical approach is used by Da Prato and\nLunardi in [7] in the finite-dimensional case. Again, if H = Rd then the paper [7] covers\nessentially the most general situation, while, if dim H = \u221e, several interesting situations\nincluding (1.4) are not covered by the existing literature.\nAll papers cited above (and many others) use the Yosida approximations (1.3) and the\napproximating processes X n , solving (1.1) with U = Un . If H = Rd , C\u00e9pa [11] proves that\nX n converges almost surely to the solution of the limit differential inclusion; moreover, Da\nPrato and Lunardi prove that the operator L defined in (1.5), with a Neumann condition at\nthe boundary of K := {U < +\u221e}, is self-adjoint in L2 (Rd , e\u22122U dx). In infinite dimension,\nonly weaker results are known under more restrictive assumptions.\nOur approach allows to prove that under rather general conditions, the transition semigroup of X n\nPtn \u03c6(x) := E [\u03c6(Xtn (x))] ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cb (H), t \u2265 0, x \u2208 H,\n\nconverges as n \u2192 \u221e to a semigroup Pt , and in particular that the finite dimensional\ndistributions of the Markov process X n converge. We can prove this, for instance, when\n(\u22122A)\u22121 is trace-class, for any convex lower semi-continuous U : H 7\u2192] \u2212 \u221e, +\u221e] such\nthat \u03bc(U < \u221e) > 0 with \u03bc := N (0, (\u22122A)\u22121 ), and Un is the Yosida approximation of U .\nFor instance, in the case (1.4) with dim H = \u221e this result seems to be new.\nWe stress that we do not prove that the limit process X, which exists by the Kolmogorov\nextension theorem, solves (1.1): this can be (and has been) done in several interesting\nsituations, like for equations (1.6) and (3.4) below, but only in particular cases and using\nadditional information about the model. For instance, a detailed description of the right\nhand side of the integration by parts formula (2.7) below, combined with the Fukushima\ndecomposition, can lead to interesting results: see [17].\n\n\fCONVERGENCE OF APPROXIMATIONS OF MONOTONE GRADIENT SYSTEMS\n\n3\n\nWe describe now briefly some applications of our general result. First, we discuss the\nfollowing Stochastic Partial Differential Equation of Cahn-Hilliard type and reflection at\n0, that has been considered in [10]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u22022 \u22022u\n\u2202\n\u2202u\n=\u2212 2\n+\u03b7 +\n\u1e86 ,\nu \u2265 0,\nd\u03b7 \u2265 0,\nu d\u03b7 = 0\n(1.6)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 2\n\u2202\u03b8\nwhere u is a continuous function of (t, \u03b8) \u2208 [0, +\u221e) \u00d7 [0, 1], \u03b7 is a locally finite positive\nmeasure on (0, +\u221e) \u00d7 [0, 1] called the reflection measure, preventing u from becoming\nnegative, and \u1e86 is a space-time white noise on [0, +\u221e) \u00d7 [0, 1]. In this case we have\nH = H \u22121 (0, 1), Sobolev space of order \u22121, and U of the form (1.4) with K := {x \u2208\nL2 (0, 1) : x \u2265 0}. If we choose:\n\uf8f1 R1\n\uf8f2 n 0 [x(\u03b8) \u2227 0]2 d\u03b8\nx \u2208 L2 (0, 1)\nUn (x) :=\n\uf8f3\n+\u221e\nx \u2208 H \u22121 (0, 1)\\L2 (0, 1)\n\nthen our method applies and we can prove convergence of X n as n \u2192 \u221e. Notice that\nUn is not smooth in the topology of H (in fact, Un is the Yosida approximation of U in\nL2 (0, 1) rather than in H). We notice that X n is not a monotone sequence in n, and no\ndeterministic method is known to prove convergence of X n .\nAnother interesting application is provided by interface models: in [15], Funaki and Olla\nintroduce a finite dimensional SDE whose solution (\u03c6i , i = 1, . . . , N ) is stationary with\nrespect to a 1-dimensional Gibbs measure. The process \u03c6i is always non-negative and \u03c6\nmodels the motion of an interface between a gas and a liquid phase. Under a suitable\nrescaling, the process \u03c6 converges in law to the solution a SPDE with reflection:\nZ\n\u22022v\n\u2202v\n=\n+ \u03b6 + \u1e86 ,\nv \u2265 0,\nd\u03b6 \u2265 0,\nv d\u03b6 = 0.\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8 2\n\nAlso this problems fits in the general scheme we discuss here: a sequence (\u03c6N ) associated\nwith a Dirichlet form like (1.2) with \u03bd n = Z1n e\u22122Un dx and Un convex, and a limit process\nv associated with a Dirichlet form like (1.2) with \u03bd weak limit of \u03bd n . Indeed, also the\nresults of [15] can be proven using the techniques of this paper: we refer to [18].\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we present the setting and the main\nresults; in section 3 we show some applications; in section 4 we give a tightness lemma\nand in section 5 we prove the main results.\n1.1. Notation. For a real separable Hilbert space H, we denote the scalar product by\nh*, *iH and the associated norm by k * kH . If J is Hilbert space with scalar product h*, *iJ\nand associated norm k * kJ such that J is continuously embedded in H, we denote by\nCb (J), respectively Cb1 (J), the space of all bounded uniformly continuous functions on J,\nresp. bounded and uniformly continuous together with the first Fr\u00e9chet derivative. For all\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cb1 (J) we the directional derivative of \u03c6 along h \u2208 J denote by \u2202h \u03c6:\n1\n\u2202h \u03c6(x) := lim (\u03c6(x + th) \u2212 \u03c6(x)),\nt\u21920 t\n\nx \u2208 J.\n\nIf \u2207J \u03c6 : J 7\u2192 J denotes the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of \u03c6, then we have:\nh\u2207J \u03c6(x), hiJ = \u2202h \u03c6(x),\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 J, h \u2208 J.\n\n\f4\n\nLORENZO ZAMBOTTI\n\nIf \u0393 \u2282 H is closed and convex, we denote by Lip(\u0393) the set of all bounded \u03c6 : \u0393 7\u2192 R with:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|\u03c6(h) \u2212 \u03c6(k)|\n[\u03c6]Lip(\u0393) := sup\n, h 6= k, h, k \u2208 \u0393 < \u221e.\nkh \u2212 kkH\n\nFinally, if D \u2282 H is dense, we define ExpD (H) \u2282 Cb (H) as the linear span of {cos(hh, *iH ),\nsin(hh, *iH ) : h \u2208 D}.\n2. Main result\n\nIn this section we describe the general setting and the main result. In the next section\nwe show some concrete example.\nAll processes we consider take values in the fixed separable Hilbert space H, which could\nbe finite or infinite dimensional. In order to cover also convergence of finite dimensional\napproximations, we consider a sequence (Hn )n of closed affine subspaces of H, each itself\na Hilbert space endowed with a scalar product h*, *iHn and associated norm k * kHn , such\nthat for a fixed constant c > 0:\n1\nkhkH \u2264 khkHn \u2264 c khkH ,\n\u2200 h \u2208 Hn , n \u2208 N.\n(2.1)\nc\nFor all n \u2208 N we consider a probability measure \u03bd n on Hn with topological support\nKn \u2286 Hn and we suppose that Kn is convex and closed.

Indeed, setting Tn : Cb (H) 7\u2192\nR\nR, Tn \u03c6 := \u03c6 d\u03a3nh , the family of linear functionals (Tn )n is equicontinuous and converges\non the dense set Cb1 (H) in the sup-norm and therefore converges on Cb (H), i.e. we have\n(2.5). The proof of the density of Cb1 (H) in Cb (H) in the sup-norm can be found in [9,\nTheorem 2.2.1].\nOn the other hand, consider a dense sequence (xj )j in H and set Aki := \u222anj=1 B(xj , 1/k).\nIt is enough to prove that there exists i such |\u03a3nh |(H\\Aki ) \u2264 2\u2212k /m: indeed, in this case\nJm := \u2229k Aki is a compact set such that |\u03a3nh |(H\\Jm ) \u2264 1/m.

By the lower semicontinuity of the total variation on open sets we find: |\u03a3h |(Aki ) \u2264 |\u03a3h |(H) \u2212 2\u2212k /m for all\ni and therefore |\u03a3h |(H) \u2264 |\u03a3h |(H) \u2212 2\u2212k /m, a contradiction. Therefore (2.6) is proven.\nWe prove now (3.3). Let Z be a H-valued random variable with distribution \u03bc = N (0, Q)\nand h \u2208 D(A). We can suppose that h\u22122Ah, hiH = 1. Setting: Y := Z + hZ, 2Ahi h,\nwe have that Z = Y \u2212 hZ, 2Ahih and Y is independent of hZ, 2Ahi. Notice that Y \u223c\nN (0, Q \u2212 h \u2297 h) and hZ, 2Ahi \u223c N (0, 1). Then for all z \u2208 H we can write uniquely\nz = y + th with t \u2208 R and y \u2208 (Ah)\u22a5 \u2282 H and with this notation:\n\u03bc(dz) = N (0, 1)(dt) * N (0, Q \u2212 h \u2297 h)(dy).\n\nLet now V : H 7\u2192] \u2212 \u221e, +\u221e] be convex and lower semi-continuous.

The map\nn 7\u2192 mint vn (t) is monotone non-decreasing. We want to prove that limn min vn = min v.\nBy (3.2): lim|t|\u2192\u221e vn (t) = \u221e for all n \u2208 N.

By monotone convergence and since\nZ n \u2192 Z, (3.3) is proven. \u0003\nIn analogy with the finite dimensional example of the next subsection, if K 6= H then\n\u03a3h is expected to contain an infinite dimensional boundary term: this has been explicitly\ncomputed in several recent papers, for instance [17], [3], [14], [10]. If U is, as in (1.4), equal\nto 0 on K and to +\u221e on H\\K, then Theorem 2.1 gives a construction of the reflecting\nO.U. process in K, in analogy with Fukushima's approach to reflecting processes in finite\ndimension: see examples 4.4.2 and 4.5.3 in [13].\nFor instance, let us consider the case H = L2 (0, 1), A the realization of \u2202 2 with homogeneous Dirichlet condition at {0, 1} and U of the form (1.4) with K := {x \u2208 L2 (0, 1) :\nx \u2265 \u2212\u03b1} with \u03b1 \u2265 0. Then the Yosida approximation of U is the distance from K in H,\nthe process X n is the solution of the SPDE:\n\u22022X n \u22022W\n\u2202X n\n=\n+\n+ 2n (X n + \u03b1)\u2212 ,\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1]\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8 2\n\u2202t\u2202\u03b8\nwhere W is a Brownian sheet, and the limit X solves the following SPDE with reflection:\nZ\n\u2202X\n\u22022X\n\u22022W\n=\n+ \u03b7(t, \u03b8),\nX \u2265 \u2212\u03b1, d\u03b7 \u2265 0,\n(X + \u03b1) d\u03b7 = 0,\n(3.4)\n+\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8 2\n\u2202t\u2202\u03b8\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a reflection term which prevents the continuous solution X from becoming less\nthan \u2212\u03b1: see [17]. If \u03b1 > 0 then we are in the situation of Proposition 3.1. If \u03b1 = 0 then\n\u03bc(K) = 0 and Proposition 3.1 does not apply directly. However in this case it is possible\nto let first n \u2192 \u221e with \u03b1 > 0 and afterwards let \u03b1 \u2192 0: both these limits satisfy the\nassumptions of Hypothesis 1 and 2.\nAnother interesting example is the Cahn-Hilliard equation with reflection (1.6) described\nin the introduction.\n3.2.

However the convergence of \u03a3nh to\n\u03a3h in the sense of (2.5) and (2.6), is quite general and of independent interest.\nConsider for instance the example (1.4) with K \u2282 Rd a convex compact set with nonempty interior.

We want to prove first that there exists a measurable kernel\n(r\u03bb (x, A) : \u03bb > 0, x \u2208 K, A \u2208 B(H)), such that for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cb (H) and x \u2208 K:\nZ\nR\u03bb \u03c6(x) =\n\u03c6(y) r\u03bb (x, dy).\n(5.7)\n\nb in distribution of X\nb n along a subsequence (ni )i .\nBy Lemma 4.1 there exists a limit X\n(2)\nThen for all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cb (H ) \u2282 Cb (H):\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u03bb t\nb ni ) \u03c6(X\nb ni )] dt\nb\nb\ne\u2212\u03bb t E [\u03c8(X\ne\nE [\u03c8(X0 ) \u03c6(Xt )] dt = lim\nt\n0\ni\u2192\u221e\n0\nZ0\nZ\n\u03c8 R\u03bbni \u03c6 d\u03bd ni =\n\u03c8 R\u03bb \u03c6 d\u03bd.\n= lim\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nSince this is true for any \u03c8 \u2208 Cb (H (2) ) we obtain:\nZ \u221e\nbt ) | X\nb0 = x] dt,\ne\u2212\u03bb t E [\u03c6(X\nR\u03bb \u03c6(x) =\n0\n\n\u03bd \u2212 a.e. x.\n\nTherefore for \u03bb > 0 fixed, the measurable kernel r\u03bb (x, *) exists for \u03bd-a.e. x, in particular for\nx in a set K0 dense in K. Let now any x \u2208 K\\K0 and \u03c6n \u2208 Cb (H) a monotone sequence\nconverging pointwise to \u03c6 \u2208 Cb (H) and let xm \u2208 K converging to x. Then R\u03bb \u03c6n (xm )\nconverges to R\u03bb \u03c6(xm ) by Dominated Convergence. Since (R\u03bb \u03c6n )n is equicontinuous, then\nnecessarily also R\u03bb \u03c6n (x) must converge to R\u03bb \u03c6(x), and the existence of r\u03bb (x, *) follows\nfrom general measure theory.\nWe prove now convergence of Ptn \u03c6(\u03a0Kn (x)) to Pt \u03c6(x). Let \u03c6 \u2208 Lip(H): by (2.2), for\nevery t > 0 and for any sequence \u03b5N \u2192 0, we have pointwise convergence of [Ptn \u03c6] \u25e6 \u03a0Kn\nalong a subsequence (mi )i to F \u2208 Cb (H): see step 1 of the proof of Proposition 5.1. We\nwant to prove that F = Pt \u03c6. Let mn,\u03c6 be the spectral measure of the generator of E n\nassociated with \u03c6:\nZ\nZ 0\n1\nn,\u03c6\n\u03bb > 0, l \u2208 N.\nm (dx) =\n\u03c6 (R\u03bbn )l \u03c6 d\u03bd n ,\nl\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\nx)\n\u2212\u221e\nAnalogously, we denote the spectral measure of the generator of E associated with \u03c6 by\nm\u03c6 . By (5.7) and Lemma 5.2, we obtain that (R\u03bbn )l converges pointwise to (R\u03bb )l , and\ntherefore for all \u03bb > 0, l \u2208 N, by Proposition 5.1:\nZ 0\nZ 0\n1\n1\nn\u2192\u221e\nn,\u03c6\nm (dx) \u2212\u2192\nm\u03c6 (dx).\nl\nl\n\u2212\u221e (\u03bb \u2212 x)\n\u2212\u221e (\u03bb \u2212 x)\n\nBy the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, the vector space spanned by the set of functions {x 7\u2192\n(\u03bb\u2212x)\u2212l , \u03bb > 0, l \u2208 N} is dense in the set C0 ((\u2212\u221e, 0]) of continuous functions on (\u2212\u221e, 0]\nvanishing at \u2212\u221e. In particular we obtain:\nZ\nZ 0\nZ\nZ 0\nn\u2192\u221e\ntx\n\u03c6\ntx\nn,\u03c6\nn\nn\ne m (dx) =\n\u03c6 Pt \u03c6 d\u03bd.\ne m (dx) \u2212\u2192\n\u03c6 Pt \u03c6 d\u03bd =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nBy polarization we have for all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cb (H):\nZ\nZ\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03c8 Pt \u03c6 d\u03bd\n\u03c8 Ptn \u03c6 d\u03bd n \u2212\u2192\n\nand we conclude that limn\u2192\u221e Ptn \u03c6(\u03a0Kn (x)) = Pt \u03c6(x) for all x \u2208 K. By the density of\nLip(H) in Cb (H), Ptn \u03c6(\u03a0Kn (x)) converges to Pt \u03c6(x) for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cb (H).\n\n\fCONVERGENCE OF APPROXIMATIONS OF MONOTONE GRADIENT SYSTEMS\n\n15\n\nArguing like for the existence of the kernel r\u03bb , we can prove that there exists a measurable kernel (pt (x, A) : t \u2265 0, x \u2208 K, A \u2208 B(H)), such that:\nZ\nPt \u03c6(x) =\n\u03c6(y) pt (x, dy),\n\u2200 x \u2208 K, \u03c6 \u2208 Cb (H).\n\nBy Lemma 5.2, we can now prove the convergence stated in the third assertion of Theorem 2.1, obtaining also that (pt (x, dy))t,x satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.\nBy the Kolmogorov extension Theorem we have existence of the Markov process X. Convergence of Pt \u03c6(x) to \u03c6(x) follows from the strong continuity of Pt in L2 (\u03bd), the estimate\n[Pt \u03c6]Lip(H) \u2264 c [\u03c6]Lip(H) which follows from (2.2) and the density of Lip(H) in Cb (H).\nThe closability of E has been proven in Proposition 5.1. The last assertion of Theorem 2.1\nfollows from Lemma 4.1 and the third assertion. \u0003\nReferences\n[1] L. Ambrosio, N. Fusco, D.
