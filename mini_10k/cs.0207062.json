Introduction\nThis report presents supplementary results to recent report series [1-3] on the distance\nfunction wavelets (DFW) transforms and series. The classic integral transforms and series\nare seen to base on eigenfunctions of partial differential equation (PDE), while the DFW\nuses the fundamental and/or general solutions of PDEs. Notably different from the former\ntwo, the common wavelets have very little to do with the solutions of PDEs and are often\nconstructed via the filter theory and spline construction approach. Similarly, most\nresearch on the distance functions (radial basis functions, rbf) has long ignored the\nunderlying PDE and integral equation theory. The PDE is arguable language describing\nthe laws of universe [4]. Thus, the wavelets and distance functions should be established\non the kernel solutions of PDEs. [5] has made a brief comment on wavelets (rbf\nprewavelets) and rbf from a PDE perspective.\nThe standard applications of the distance functions such as the multiquadratics (MQ) and\nthin plate spline (TPS) are simply single-scale calculations lacking crucial multiscale\nanalysis capability. By now, many efforts have been dedicated to examining the\ninvertiblility of the distance function approximations. Notably, scanty research, however,\nhas involved with issues of completeness and convergence. In the author's view, the\nDFW series provides a complete basis for distance function approximations and thus\nguarantees the convergence. Most importantly, the DFW are very powerful and flexible\nto deal with the multifractal, multiscale, multivariate scattered data and meshfree\nnumerical solution of PDE.\nThe rest of the report is organized into a few independent sections. Section 2 further\nrefines the general (fractional) distance in terms of the Riesz potential. The Abel DFW\ntransform is also presented via the fractional integral and Laplacian. Section 3 illustrates\nthe underlying connections between the DFW Laplace transform, Weyl transform and\nRadon transform. In section 4, by analogy with the Taylor and polynomial interpolation\nexpansions, a conjecture is presented on the truncation error formula of the multiple\nreciprocity (MR) Laplace DFW series, and then, the error distribution is discussed in\n\n2\n\n\fcomparison to the Chebyshev polynomial interpolation. In section 5, the local Hermite\ndistance function expansion is presented to compete with overlapping in the domain\ndecomposition. In terms of the Possion kernel, section 6 defines the MQ shape parameter\nas an extra axis contribution to Euclidean distance. Finally, some issues are remarked in\nsection 7.\n\n2. General distance, fractal, fractional integral and Laplacian,\nAbel DFW transforms\n\nThe Riesz potential [6] is defined by\n\nI s f (x ) =\n\nf (\u03be )\n\u0393((n \u2212 s ) 2 )\nd\u03be ,\nn\nn2 s\nn\u2212s\n\u222b\nIR\n\u03c0 2 \u0393(s 2 )\nx \u2212\u03be\n\n0 p s p n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the order of Riesz potential, and n is the topological dimension. Accordingly,\n[3] defined a general distance variable by\n1s\n\ns\uf8f6\n\uf8eb n\nrks = \uf8ec \u2211 (x i \u2212 x ki ) \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed i =1\n\uf8f8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere s could even be a complex number in relation to complex dimensions and is\nconnected with capacity dimension, fractional derivative, fractal [3] and Holder\nexponent. It is noted that s=2 leads to the Newtonian potential and corresponding\nEuclidean distance.\n\nIt is known [7] that the forward Abel transform\n\nf (x ) = \u222b\n\nx\n\n0\n\ng (t )dt\n(x \u2212 t )1\u2212 \u03b2\n3\n\n0 p \u03b2 p1,\n\n(3)\n\n\fcan be seen as a fractional integral [8] in one dimension, while the backward Abel\ntransform\n\ng (t ) = \u2212\n\nsin(\u03c0 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 )) d t f ( x )dx\n\u03c0\ndt \u222b0 ( x \u2212 t )\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nis easily regarded as a fractional derivative. [6] also relates the fractional integral to the\nRiesz potential [1]. Thus, we can construct the multidimensional DFW Abel transforms\n\nH ( y, x ) =\n\n\u0393((n \u2212 y ) 2 )\nh (\u03be )\nd\u03be ,\nn\nn2 y\n\u222b\n\u03c0 2 \u0393( y 2 ) IR x \u2212 \u03be n \u2212 y\n\n(\n\nh(x ) = \u2212 \u2206\n\nwhere \u2212 \u2206\n\ny 2\n\ny 2\n\n0p y p 2,\n\n(5)\n\n)H ( y, x ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nis the fractional Laplacian of y order.\n\n3. DFW Laplace transforms and Radon transforms\n\nThe DFW Weyl transform was presented by [3]:\n\nWn (\u03be , \u03b3 ) =\n\n[\n\n2\u0393(n 2 )\n2\nf (x ) \u03be \u2212 x \u2212 \u03b3 2\nn\n\u222b\nIR\n\uf8eb n \u22121\uf8f6\n\u03c0 \u0393\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2 \uf8f8\n\n4\n\n]\n\n(n \u22123 ) 2\n\n(\n\n2\n\n)\n\n\u03be \u2212 x H \u03be \u2212 x \u2212 \u03b3 2 dx ,\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere H is the Heaviside step function. [9] links the radial Weyl and Radon transforms\nby\n\nRn f =\n\n\u03c0n2\n\n\u0393(n 2 )\n\nWn f .\n\n(8)\n\nBy (7) and (8), we have the DFW Radon transform\n\nRn (\u03be , \u03b3 ) =\n\n[\n\n2\u03c0 n 2\n2\nf (x ) \u03be \u2212 x \u2212 \u03b3 2\nn\n\u222b\n\u0393(n 2 ) IR\n\n]\n\n(n \u2212 3 ) 2\n\n(\n\n2\n\n)\n\n\u03be \u2212 x H \u03be \u2212 x \u2212 \u03b3 2 dx ,\n\n(9)\n\nLet the shape parameter \u03b3=0, the DFW Radon transform turns out to be the DFW Laplace\npotential transform\n\n2\u03c0 n 2\n(n \u2212 2 )\nDn (\u03be , n ) =\nf (x ) \u03be \u2212 x\ndx\nn\n\u222b\nIR\n\u0393(n 2 )\nf (x )\n1\n=\ndx\nn\n*\n\u222b\nn \u2212 2 IR u Ln ( \u03be \u2212 x )\n\nn\u22602,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere u L*n is the fundamental solution of the n-dimensional Laplace equation, and the\n\"scale parameter\" of this DFW transform is the dimensionality. It is easy to see that the\nWeyl transform is a shifted DFW Laplace transform.\n\nAccording to (10), we find that the weight function 1 \u03be \u2212 x in various potential DFW\ntransforms presented in chapter 2 and 3 of [3] may not be necessary. In addition, the\ndimensional parameter n in the backward DFW potential transforms may be replaced by\n(n-2) instead or simply removed.\n\n5\n\n\f4. Conjecture on truncation error of MR Laplace DFW series\n\nThe multiple reciprocity Laplacian DFW series is given by [3]\n\nN\n\nM\n\nf ( x ) = f 0 ( x ) + \u2211\u2211\u03b1 mk u L*m ( x \u2212 x k ) + R ( x ) ,\n\n(11)\n\nn\n\nm =1 k =1\n\nwhere f0(x) is evaluated via the boundary integral equation detailed in [1,3], and u L*m is the\nn\n\nfundamental solution of the m-th order n-dimensional Laplacian \u22072(m+1). R(x) is the\ntruncation error. It is noted that when the order m\u22651, these kernel solutions are no longer\nsingular at the origin.\n\nThe above MR Laplacian DFW series is an analogue to the polynomial interpolation. By\nanalogy with the truncation error formula of Taylor and polynomial interpolation\nexpansions, a conjecture formula on the MR Laplacian DFW expansion (11) is given by\n\nR(x ) =\n\nC\n(M !)N\n\nM\n\n\u220f\nk\n\nx \u2212 x k (\u2207 2 ( N +1) f (\u03be )),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a node among interpolation domain. [10] conjectured that the truncation error\nunder M nodes and N scale might be O(M-N(logM)n-1) and is independent of\ndimensionality. The known accuracy orders of the TPS and cubic spline are the special\ncases of (12).\n\nAs in the case of polynomial interpolations, the error distribution is determined by\n\n6\n\n\fM\n\nw( x ) = \u220f x \u2212 x k .\n\n(13)\n\nk\n\nThe optimal placement of nodes should satisfy the minimization of maximum w(x),\nnamely,\n\nx k \u2192 Min (Max (w( x ))) .\n\n(14)\n\nIn the classic Chebyshev polynomials, we have L2 optimal distribution of truncation\nerrors which satisfies (14). Under the uniformly-spaced nodes, the truncation errors at the\ncentral region will be much less than those at the vicinity of the boundary. So, the nodes\nshould be placed increasingly dense toward the boundary as the zeros of Chebyshev\npolynomials in one dimensional case. Meanwhile, the condition of interpolation matrix\nunder the optimal placement of nodes is also relatively better.\n\n5. Hermite interpolation, edge effect, and domain decomposition\n\nThe domain decomposition seems a promising technique to result in a sparse matrix of\ndistance function interpolation. Overlapping among different subdomains is a common\napproach for connectivity. However, the arbitrary placement of overlapping nodes causes\nsome troublesome issues in practical engineering computing.\n\nLet Q(x) is the object function to be approximated. If\n\nR{Q ( x )} = g ( x )\n\n7\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere R is a differential operator, and g(x) tends to be zero or very smooth. We think R\nis a good smoothing operator in the distance function approximation of Q(x). In terms of\nGreen second identity, we have\n\uf8ee \uf8f1\uf8f4 \u2202Q (x j ) *\n\u2202uR* (x \u2212 x j )\uf8f9\nc( x )Q ( x ) = \u2212 \u222b g ( x k )u ( x \u2212 x k )dx k + \u222b \uf8ef \uf8f2\nuR (x \u2212 x j ) \u2212 Q (x j )\n\uf8fa dx j (16)\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u2202n\n\uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f4\uf8f3 \u2202n\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n*\nR\n\nwhere uR* is the fundamental solution of R; n is the unit outward normal; xk and xj denote\nsource points on the whole domain and the boundary, respectively. c(x) depends on the\nlocation, c(x)=1 inside domain and c(x)=1/2 on smooth boundary, varying c(x) on\nirregular boundary vertices.\n\nBy numerical integration of (16), Chen [11] presented a Hermite scheme of distance\nfunction interpolation to mitigate the so-called edge effect in the function interpolation\nand numerical solution of PDEs, i.e.\n\nQ (x ) =\n\nN +L\n\nN +2 L\n\nN +3L\n\ni =1\n\ni = N + L +1\n\ni = N + L +1\n\n\u2211 \u03b2 i\u03c6 ( x \u2212 x i ) +\n\n\u2211 \u03b2 i\u03c6 ( x \u2212 x i ) +\n\n\u2211\n\n\uf8eb \u2202\u03c6 ( x \u2212 xi ) \uf8f6\n\uf8f7,\n\u2202n\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03b2i \uf8ec \u2212\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the kernel distance function built on the fundamental solution uR*. N and L are\nrespectively the numbers of inside domain and boundary nodes. Note that the boundary\nnodes are here interpolated twice respectively for Dirichlet and Neumann data. To keep\nthe symmetry of the interpolation matrix, a minus sign is added before Neumann\nboundary in (17) due to the fact that Neumann boundary condition is not self-adjoint.\n\nIn terms of the Local boundary integral equation [12] and corresponding Green second\nidentity, we can extend the above interpolation scheme into subdomains and has an\nalternative scheme to overlapping in the domain decomposition technique. Namely, by\n8\n\n\fkeeping the different degrees of differential continuity, we can connect different\nsubdomains without using overlapping nodes. The penalty is that the scheme is not fully\nmeshfree any more since we need connect large or small subregions through somehow\nconnectivity like those in the standard FEM mesh.\n\n(17) can also be easily extended to implementing multiple boundary conditions of high\norder partial equation problems. For instance, we need to enforce two boundary\nconditions at each boundary knot for the biharmonic equation. In that case, we have\n\nQ (x ) =\n\nN + L1\n\nN +L\n\nN + L1 + L2\n\nN +3L\n\n\u2211 \u03b2 \u03c6 (x \u2212 x ) + \u2211 \u03b2 B {\u03c6 (x \u2212 x )}+ \u2211 \u03b2 B {\u03c6 (x \u2212 x )}+ \u2211 \u03b2 B {\u03c6 (x \u2212 x )},\ni\n\ni =1\n\ni\n\ni\n\n1\n\ni\n\ni\ni = N + L1 +1\n\ni = N +1\n\n2\n\ni\n\ni 3\ni = N + L1 + L2 +1\n\ni\n\n(18)\nwhere B's and L's with the subscripts 1,2,3 indicate the three different boundary\nconditions and the corresponding numbers of boundary knots. For Neumann boundary\nconditions we need add a minus sign as did in (15) to get a symmetric interpolation.\n\n6. Shape parameter in MQ-type kernel distance functions\n\nReplacing the Euclidean distance variable rk by the MQ\n\nrk2 + c 2 in the rotational\n\ninvariant fundamental solution and general solution of PDEs will yield a variety of the\nMQ-type kernel distance functions (KDF) [3,10]. In particular, [3] pointed out that the\nPossion kernel belongs to the MQ-type KDF, i.e.\nPqn ( x \u2212 x k , q ) =\n\n(x\u2212x\n\ncn q\n2\nk\n\n+q\n\n9\n\n2\n\n)\n\n(n +1) 2\n\n,\n\nq>0,\n\n(19)\n\n\f\u222b P (x )dx = 1\n\nwhere n denotes dimension, and x\u2208Rn+1.\n\nn\nq\n\nfor all q>0, and q is the shape\n\nparameter in terms of the MQ. The object function f(x) is defined boundary condition on\nq=0 surface of a Rn+1 domain, i.e.\nu ( x,0) = f ( x ) .\n\n(20)\n\nWe also have\nu ( x, q ) = (Pqn * f )( x ) =\n\n2q\n\n\u03c9 n +1\n\n\u222b\n\nIR\n\nn\n\nf (\u03be )\n\n(\u03be \u2212 x\n\n2\n\n+ q2\n\n(n +1) 2 d\u03be\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nWhen shape parameter q \u2192 \u221e , the function is approximated as the boundary value in\ninfinite surface.\n\nThe MQ-type distance function expansion should be stated as\n\nN\n\nM\n\nf ( x ) \u2245 a 0 + \u2211\u2211\u03b1 mk\nj =1 k =1\n\n)\n\n(\n\nx \u2212 x k + c 2j .\n\n(22)\n\nIt is noted that the augmented polynomial terms are not necessary as in the boundary\nintegral equation. We also have a general DFW series as follows:\n\nN\n\nM\n\nf ( x ) \u2245 a 0 + \u2211\u2211\u03b1 mk x \u2212 x k\nm =1 k =1\n\n10\n\nm\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\n\f7. Other issues\n\nThe compactly-supported rbfs (CS-RBF) [13,14] are built with the spline construction.\n[15] also creates the compactly-supported spline rbf wavelets. Both CS-RBF [13,14] and\nCS-RBF wavelets [15] do not consider the dimensional effect. By analogy with the\ncompactly-supported polynomial basis function in the FEM, we can also construct the CS\nDFW via the kernel solution of the Laplace equation, where the building blocks will be\nthe fundamental solutions of different order Laplacians. We can call them the Laplacian\nspline, which also has something to do with what we discussed in the preceding section\n[5].\n\nFurthermore, by analogy with the rational polynomial interpolation, we also have the\nrational Laplace DFW series of the form:\n\nN1 M 1\n\nP(x ) =\n\nP0 ( x ) + \u2211\u2211\u03b1 mk u L*m ( x \u2212 x k\nm =1 k =1\nN2 M2\n\ng 0 ( x ) + \u2211\u2211 \u03b2 ij u\ni =1 j =1\n\nn\n\n*\nLin\n\n)\n\n(x\u2212x )\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nj\n\nThe DFW built on the fundamental and general solutions of PDEs are scale orthogonal\nand can be orthonormalized via the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization scheme over\nirregular translation. For regular translation, it is not difficult to get the scale and\ntranslation orthogonal DFWs.\nThe Gaussian rbf is often considered as a candidate of weight function in moving least\nsquares in relation to various meshfree methods. In fact, the kernel distance function\npresented in [1-3] can be used to serve the same function. The differentiation smoothing\ndefined in [3] may be better renamed as differentiation elimination, which eliminates the\ninhomogeneous terms via the composite differentiation processing and leads to a\n\n11\n\n\fboundary-only approximation scheme. We also need to mention that the Neumann and\nDirichlet eigenvalues of HF series discussed in section 3.3 of [1] correspond to the\nrespective homogeneous boundary conditions and have nothing to do with the known\ninhomogeneous boundary conditions.\nBy analogy with the high-order fundamental solutions of the geodesic Laplacian distance\nfunctions [3], we have the corresponding geodesic TPS and cubic splines for\nheterogeneous media:\n\uf8f1\uf8f4[\u03ba ij ]\u22121 2 R 2 m ln R,\n\u03c6 (x \u2212 \u03be ) = \uf8f2\n\u22121 2\n2 m \u22121\n,\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 [\u03ba ij ] R\n\nn = 2,\nn = 3,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the coefficient matrix \u03ba=[\u03baij] represents the parameters in different directions (j)\nand locations (i) of anisotropic and inhomogeneous media, and the geodesic distance R is\ndefined by\n\nR2 =\n\nn\n\n\u2211\u03ba (x\n\ni , j =1\n\n\u22121\nij\n\ni\n\n\u2212 \u03be i )(x j \u2212 \u03be j ).\n\n(26)\n\nSimilarly, we have the geodesic MQ-type (Gaussian) distance functions:\n\n\u03c6 ( x \u2212 \u03be ) = [\u03ba ij ]\u22121 2 R 2 + c 2 ,\n\ng (x \u2212 \u03be ) =\n\n[\u03ba ]\n\n\uf8f1\uf8f4[\u03ba ij ]\u22121 2 (R 2 + c 2 )m ln (R 2 + c 2 ),\n\u03c8 (x \u2212 \u03be ) = \uf8f2\n[\u03ba ij ]\u22121 2 (R 2 + c 2 )2m\u22121 ,\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\n12\n\n(27a)\n\n\u22121 2\n\nij\n\nR2 + c2\n\n,\n\nn = 2,\nn = 3,\n\n(27b)\n\n(28)\n\n\fP (x \u2212 \u03be ) =\nn\nc\n\n[\u03ba ]\n\n\u22121 2\n\n(R\n\nij\n\n2\n\n+ c2 )\n\nG ( x \u2212 \u03be ) = [\u03ba ij ]\n\ne\u2212R\n\n\u22121 2\n\n( n +1) 2\n\n2\n\n\u03b12\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere c and \u03b1 are the shape parameter, and n is the dimensionality.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
