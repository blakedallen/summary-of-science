However, the practical realisation of atom-cavity\nquantum computing schemes usually requires C's above\n200 to achieve single-operation fidelities above 90 % [7\u2013\n14]. The only alternative are probabilistic quantum computing schemes. These promise fidelities above 90 % even\nwhen C = 10 but rely either on the detection of single\nphotons [15, 16] or on the observation of macroscopic fluorescence signals [17]. Because of being conditional, they\nrequire relatively high photon detection efficiencies and\ncavity mirrors with low absorption coefficients. Using\ncurrently available experimental setups to entangle atoms\nin optical cavities with a very high fidelity therefore requires a different approach than previously proposed in\nthe literature.\nRecently it has been pointed out by several authors\n[18\u201326] that it is possible to generate entanglement in a\ncontrolled way by simply cooling qubits into well-defined,\nhighly entangled states. The main idea behind this approach is to design laser fields such that the target state\nbecomes the stationary state of the system. State preparation schemes based on this idea are expected to tolerate much higher spontaneous decay rates than proposals\nwhich do not use dissipation in this way. Moreover, when\ncooling a system into an entangled state, the fidelity of\nthe state preparation no longer depends on the initial\nstate of the system which makes the entanglement generation more robust against errors. Although being very\npromising, this approach has only recently been studied\nas a tool to entangle two atoms trapped inside the same\noptical cavity. The only examples are Kastoryano et al.\n\n(b)\n\n\u0393\n\n|2\ufffd\n\n\u03930\n\ng\n\n\u03931\n\n\u03ba\n\u03a9 0 , \u03a91\n\n|0\ufffd\n\n|1\ufffd\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Experimental setup to cool two atoms inside an\noptical cavity into a maximally entangled state.

The 1\u20132 transition couples resonantly with coupling constant g to the cavity field. The spontaneous decay rates for the 0\u20132 and the 1\u20132 transitions are\n\u03930 and \u03931 with \u0393 = \u03930 + \u03931 .\n\n[27] and Wang and Schirmer [28].\nIn this paper we follow similar ideas as Refs. [27, 28]\nand design an entangling scheme to cool two atoms inside an optical cavity into a maximally entangled state.\nAs proposed in Ref. [23], and in close analogy to the\nlaser sideband cooling technique of trapped ions [29], we\nemploy level shifts and apply laser fields such that only\nthe target state experiences off-resonant driving. Every\nground state of the system other than the target state\ncouples resonantly and sufficiently strong to rapidly decaying excited states. Doing so, the target state becomes\nthe stationary state of the quantum system. It is reached\nindependently of the initial state of the system after a\ncertain transition time. As in laser sideband cooling, the\nfidelity of the final state reaches one when the detuning\nof the target state becomes much larger than the relevant\nlaser Rabi frequencies and decay rates.\nThe concrete experimental setup which we consider in\nthis paper is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of two atoms simultaneously trapped inside an optical cavity. The main\ndecay channels in this system are the spontaneous emis-\n\n\f2\nsion of photons from the excited atomic state |2i with\ndecay rate \u0393 and the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors with decay rate \u03ba. Both atoms are driven\nby external laser fields which couple respectively to the\n0\u20131 and the 1\u20132 transition. In the following, we design\nthe detunings and Rabi frequencies of these laser fields\nsuch that the stationary state of the atom-cavity system\nis to a very good approximation given by the maximally\nentangled atomic ground state\n\u221a\n|+i = (|01i+ |10i)/ 2 ,\n(2)\nwhile there is no photon inside the cavity. As we shall\nsee below, individual laser addressing of the atoms is not\nrequired. The entangling scheme proposed in this paper\nuses an energy shift of the target state which is due to\na non-zero atom-cavity coupling constant g as well as\nspontaneous emission from excited states. This makes it\npossible to prepare the state in Eq. (2) with a fidelity\nabove 90 % even when C is as low as 20 and without\nhaving to detect photons.\nOne advantage of the state preparation scheme presented in this paper is that it predicts higher fidelities than the recently proposed entangling schemes in\nRefs. [27, 28] although they employ similar level shifts\nto cool two the atoms into a maximally entangled state.\nRef. [27] uses a similar atomic level scheme as the one\nshown in Fig. 1 but with the addition of a driven microwave transition between the triplet states. Ref. [28]\nrelies on the presence of an external magnetic field gradient to produce the required level splittings.\nThere are five sections in this paper. In the next section, we introduce a four-level toy-model and discuss how\nto cool it into one of its ground states. The reason for\nthe introduction of this toy-model is that the entangling\nscheme proposed in this paper cannot be modelled easily analytically. There is no interaction picture in which\nthe system Hamiltonian becomes time-independent. Although being much simpler, the toy-model in Section\nII captures all the basic features of the proposed state\npreparation scheme, provides much insight into its cooling mechanism, but is nevertheless analytically tractable.\nIn Section III, we present all the details of our entangling\nscheme, draw analogies to the toy-model, and support\nour claims about the parameter dependence of its fidelity\nwith the help of numerical simulations. We finally summarize our findings in Section IV.\nII.\n\nSTATE PREPARATION IN A TOY-MODEL\n\nIn this section we consider a simple four-level system\nand pose the task to prepare it in one of its two ground\nstates. The role of the experimental parameters in this\nsimple model, i.e. its laser Rabi frequencies, detunings,\nand spontaneous decay rates, can later be mapped onto\nthe atom-cavity coupling constant g, the cavity and the\natom decay rates \u03ba and \u0393, and laser parameters \u03a9i and\n\u03b4i in the entangling scheme proposed in Section III.

The 0\u20132 and the 1\u20133\ntransitions are driven by a laser field with Rabi frequency \u03a9\nand a detuning \u2206 with respect to the 0\u20132 transition. The\nexcited atomic states both decay spontaneously into |0i and\n|1i with a decay rate \u0393/2.\n\nunderstanding of the toy-model will allow us to correctly\npredict the general dependence of the fidelity and the\ncooling rate of the proposed entangling scheme on these\nexperimental parameters.\n\nA.\n\nTheoretical model\n\nThe toy-model contains only two ground states |0i and\n|1i and two excited states |2i and |3i, as shown in Fig. 2.\nFor simplicity, we assume that the decay rates for all\nfour decay channels are the same and denote the overall\nspontaneous decay rate of level 2 and 3 by \u0393. Moreover,\nwe assume that the system is driven by a single laser\nfield of frequency \u03c9L and Rabi frequency \u03a9. This laser\nis in resonance with the 1\u20133 transition but detuned from\nthe 0\u20132 transition by a detuning \u2206. The spontaneous\nemission of photons is in the following taken into account\nusing the master equation\n%\u0307(t) = \u2212\n\ni\ni h\n\u2020\nHcond % \u2212 %Hcond\n+ R(%) ,\n~\n\n(3)\n\nwhere % is the density matrix of the system.

(3) can now be used to\ncalculate the fidelity of the proposed state preparation\nscheme, i.e. the stationary state population of its target state |0i, and its cooling rate. This is most easily\ndone using rate equations which are a complete set of\ndifferential equations for the time evolution of expectation values. The time derivative of an expectation value\nof a time-independent operator A equals\nh\u0226i = Tr(A%\u0307) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe above master equation hence implies that\n1\nh\u0226i = \u2212 i\u03a9 h [A, |0ih2| + |1ih3| + H.c.] i\n2\nX 1\n\u0393 h A|jihj| + |jihj|A i\n\u2212i\u2206 h [A, |2ih2| ] i \u2212\n2\nj=2,3\n+\n\nX X 1\n\u0393 h |jihi| A |iihj| i .\n2\ni=0,1 j=2,3\n\n(8)\n\nIn the following we consider the Hermitian operators\n|iihi|, |iihj| + |jihi|, and i(|iihj| \u2212 |jihi|) and denote their\n(real) expectation values by\nPi = hi| % |ii ,\nkij = 2Im hi| % |ji ,\nlij = 2Re hi| % |ji .\nSubstituting these operators into Eq.

This is possible when laser\ndriving is applied such that the |0i state becomes the\nstationary state of the toy-model as it applies when the\nlaser detuning for the 0\u20132 transition is much larger than\nthe other system parameters, i.e. when\n\u2206 \u001d \u03a9, \u0393 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis condition guarantees that it is much more likely\nfor the system to spontaneously decay into the |0i state\nwhen being in one of the other three states, than being\ndriven out of it [23]. Once the system has reached its\nstationary state it therefore remains there with a very\nhigh probability.\nThis is confirmed by Fig. 3 which shows the time dependence of 1 \u2212 F, i.e. of the total population in states\nother than the target state |0i, for a wide range of experimental parameters. The solid lines in this Fig. 3 are\nthe result of a numerical integration of the rate equations in Eq. (10) which assumes the worst case scenario\nwith the toy-model initially in |1i. The plots show exponential cooling towards the target state until the system\nreaches a stationary state. The fidelity of the state preparation equals the population of the |0i state and is indeed\nvery close to unity, as long as condition (11) applies.

When the system reaches\nits stationary state, the fidelity remains constant. The\nabove equation hence implies\n\u03b3h F = \u03b3c (1 \u2212 F) .\n\n(15)\n\nSince we already know F (cf. Eq. (12)), this relation can\nbe used to obtain the cooling rate after obtaining an estimate for the heating rate. As we shall see below, it is\neasier to derive an approximate expression for \u03b3h , than\ncalculating \u03b3c directly.\nConsidering the parameter regime in Eq. (11), the rate\nequations in Eq. (10) can be simplified via an adiabatic\nelimination. Only the coherences k02 and l02 evolve on\nthe fast time scale given by \u2206. Setting their time derivatives equal to zero, we find that\n\nHeating and cooling rates\n\nk02 =\nTo see how quickly the toy-model reaches its stationary state, we now introduce the notion of a cooling and\na heating rate which we denote \u03b3c and \u03b3h , respectively.\nFor simplicity, and since we are anyway only interested in\nthe general scaling of these rates with the experimental\nparameters, we assume that these rates do not depend\non the current state % of the system.

For relatively small Rabi frequencies\n\u03a9, the cooling process becomes faster with increasing \u03a9.\nHowever, it is not worth increasing \u03a9 beyond a certain\nsize which saturates \u03b3c .

(19) reflects the general parameter dependence of the cooling rate on \u03a9/\u2206\nand \u0393/\u2206 correctly. The above approximate solution is in\ngeneral slightly higher than the actual cooling rate. The\nreason for this is that the heating rate in Eq. (18) has\nbeen calculated for the case, where the system is initially\nin |0i, i.e. when it is the highest.\nE.\n\nChoosing experimental parameters\n\nFig. 4 shows that maximising the stationary state fidelity F requires a Rabi frequency \u03a9 as small as possible.\nHowever, from Fig. 5 we see that we only obtain high\ncooling rates when \u03a9 is relatively large. To minimise the\nstate preparation time while maintaining a high fidelity,\nwe therefore suggest using a laser pulse with a timedependent Rabi frequency to prepare the target state.\nThis laser pulse should be large initially and should reach\nzero by the end of the cooling process. For example one\ncould choose\n\u03a9(t) =\n\n3\u03a90\n(1 + \u03b3c (0)t)\n\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwith \u03b3c (0) being the cooling rate in Eq. (20) for the initial Rabi frequency \u03a9(0) = \u03a90 . Alternatively, one could\nchoose an exponentially decreasing Rabi frequency. However, in this case, \u03a9 would drop off too rapidly, thereby\nresulting in a fidelity that is far from optimal. Here we\ndo not discuss how to optimise the spontaneous decay\nrate, since \u0393 is in general fixed.\nFig. 6 confirms that choosing the Rabi frequency \u03a9 as\nin Eq. (22) indeed yields a significant speed up compared\n\n\f6\nto time-independent Rabi frequencies. We also observe a\nstationary state fidelity which is close to the theoretical\nmaximum obtained when setting \u03a9 = 0. From Eq. (13)\nwe see that this maximum is to a very good approximation given by\nF(\u03a9 = 0) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03932\n.\n4\u22062 + 2\u03932\n\nENTANGLING SCHEME\n\nThe toy-model described in the previous section is\nbased on a simple principle: driving populations out of\nall undesired states resonantly while driving the target\nstate off-resonantly. This approach can indeed be used\nto prepare target states with a high fidelity [23]. In this\nsection, we use this idea to prepare two atoms inside\nan optical cavity (cf. Fig. 1) in the maximally entangled\nstate |+i in Eq. (2). The first half of this section presents\na theoretical description of the atom-cavity system. After identifying its dressed states, we select appropriate\nlaser Rabi frequencies and detunings. As we shall see below, the state preparation requires three different driving\nlasers but there is no need to address atoms individually.\nA comparison with the toy-model introduced in the previous section allows us to predict the dependence of fidelity and cooling rate of the proposed state preparation\nscheme on the experimental parameters with a very high\naccuracy.\n\nA.\n\nSystem Hamiltonian without laser driving\n\nThe experimental setup which we consider in this paper consists of two atoms placed inside an optical cavity\nas shown in Fig. 1. Each atom contains a \u039b-type level\nconfiguration with ~\u03c9j and |ji denoting the corresponding energies and energy eigenstates (j = 0, 1, 2). Suppose\nthe 1\u20132 transition of each atom couples resonantly with\ncoupling strength g to the quantised cavity field mode\nwith frequency \u03c9c . Then the Hamiltonian Hsys of this\nsystem equals\nHsys =\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\n~g |1iii h2|c\u2020 + H.c. +\n\u2020\n\n+~\u03c9c c c\n\n2 X\n2\nX\ni=1 j=0\n\nEnergy\n\n|00, 0i\n\u221a\n|+, 0i \u2261 (|01, 0i+ |10, 0i) / 2\n\u221a\n|\u2212, 0i \u2261 (|01, 0i\u2212 |10, 0i) / 2\n|11, 0i\n\n0\n~\u03c91\n~\u03c91\n2~\u03c91\n\n(23)\n\nIt is indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 6. In the next Section we use similar time-dependent laser pulses to prepare\ntwo atoms inside an optical cavity relatively fast and with\na high fidelity in a maximally entangled state.\n\nIII.\n\nEnergy eigenstate\n\nTABLE I: Energy eigenstates and energy eigenvalues of the\nsystem Hamiltonian Hsys in Eq. (24) for the H0 subspace with\nno atom in |2i and no photons in the cavity.\n\n|1i differ in energy by an amount which is significantly\nlarger than ~g.\nIn the following, we identify the relevant energy eigenstates of this Hamiltonian, since this will allow us to identify appropriate laser drivings and detunings for the proposed state preparation scheme. To do so, we denote\nstates with atom 1 in |j1 i, atom 2 in |j2 i and n photons\nin the cavity by |j1 j2 , ni. Moreover we notice that the\nHamiltonian Hsys preserves the total amount of population in the excited atomic state |2i and the cavity field\nmode. It therefore acts on fixed excitation subspaces Hn\nof the complete Hilbert space whose energy eigenstates\ncan be calculated separately. The eigenstates and eigenvalues of the subspace H0 of states with no population of\nthe excited atomic state |2i and no photons in the cavity are summarised in Table I. Table II shows the eight\nenergy eigenstates and the corresponding energy eigenvalues of the subspace H1 of states with either one atom\nin |2i or one photon in the cavity and adopts the notation\n\u221a\n|\u03bc1 i \u2261 (|21, 0i\u2212 |12, 0i) / 2 ,\n|\u03bc0 , \u00b1i \u2261 (|02, 0i\u2212 |20, 0i\u00b1 |01, 1i\u2213 |10, 1i) /2 ,\n|\u03bb0 , \u00b1i \u2261 (|02, 0i+ |20, 0i\u00b1 |01, 1i\u00b1 |10, 1i) /2 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n|\u03bb1 , \u00b1i \u2261 |12, 0i+ |21, 0i\u00b1 2 |11, 1i /2 .\n(25)\nFortunately, there is no need to identify the energy eigenstates of the atom-cavity system of the subspace of states\nwith more than one excitation in the atomic state |2i and\nthe cavity field mode. The reason for this is that these\nstates do not couple directly to the states in Table I in\ncase of laser driving. Therefore they do not have to be\ntaken into account when choosing laser parameters such\nthat only the |+, 0i state experiences off-resonant laser\ndriving.\nB.\n\n~\u03c9j |jiii hj|\n(24)\n\nin the absence of external laser driving.

For simplicity, we show\nonly the least detuned couplings.\n\nAppropriate laser parameters\n\nAs already mentioned above, the target state of the\nstate preparation which we propose here is the maximally entangled atomic state |+i in Eq. (2). In order to\nassure that this state becomes the stationary state of the\natom-cavity system in Fig. 1, we need to choose the laser\n(1)\n(2)\nfrequencies \u03c9L0 , \u03c9L0 , and \u03c9L1 such that the |+, 0i experiences only off-resonant driving, while the states |00, 0i,\n|\u2212, 0i, and |11, 0i couple resonantly to at least one of the\nthree driving lasers. Having a closer look at Table III,\nwe see that this applies, if we choose\n(1)\n\n\u03c9L0 = \u03c92 \u2212 g ,\n(2)\n\n\u03c9L0 = \u03c92 ,\n\u03c9L1 = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2g .\n\n(32)\n\nTable IV shows the effect of this choice of laser frequencies on the sixteen transitions which need to be taken into\naccount when designing the state preparation scheme\nproposed in this paper.\nThe system Hamiltonian Hsys treats both atoms in exactly the same way. Its eigenvectors are therefore either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to an exchange of the two atoms. The same applies to the effective laser Hamiltonian H\u0303L (t). Since both atoms experience exactly the same Rabi frequencies, the lasers\nexcite either transitions between two symmetric states\n\nor two anti-symmetric states. This allows us to consider\nthe symmetric and the antisymmetric state space separately when analysing the effect of the laser driving in the\ndressed state picture of the atom-cavity system. There\nare three symmetric ground states and one antisymmetric ground state. These are {|00, 0i, |+, 0i, |11, 0i} and\n{|\u2212, 0i} respectively.\nFig. 7 illustrates the laser driving experienced by the\ntarget state |+, 0i. Since this state is a symmetric state,\nthe relevant level configuration involves only the target\nstate and the four symmetric states with one excitation\nin |2i or the cavity mode. As one can see from Table\nIV, in the dressed state picture, these three lasers involve |+, 0i in six different transitions. For simplicity, we\nshow only the least detuned couplings for each laser. We\nsee that the target state |+, 0i experiences indeed only\noff-resonant driving. The smallest and therefore most\nrelevant detuning is given by\n\u221a\n\u03b4min = ( 2 \u2212 1)g ,\n(33)\nas long as the frequency \u03c91 is sufficiently larger than the\natom-cavity coupling constant g. All other states with no\nexcitation are resonantly driven by one laser field. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 8 which shows the resonant transitions in the symmetric and the antisymmetric subspace\nseparately.

In principle,\nwe would like these lasers which empty unwanted states\nto be relatively strong. However, it is not possible to increase them without increasing also the Rabi frequencies\nfor the off-resonant driving of the target state shown in\nFig. 7.\n\nE.\n\nFidelities and cooling rates for constant laser\ndriving\n\nEq. (33) shows that the minimum detuning experienced by the target state \u03b4min depends only on the atomcavity coupling constant g. Eq. (11) in Section II therefore suggests that the stationary state of the atom-cavity\nsystem in Fig. 1 is to a very good approximation given\nby the state |+, 0i as long as\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c91 \u001d g \u001d \u0393, \u03ba, \u03a90 , \u03a90 , \u03a91 .\n\n(34)\n\nIn other words, for this parameter regime we can expect\nthe atoms to be with a very high fidelity in the maximally\nentangled state |+i in Eq. (2) after a certain transition\ntime t. A comparison with the toy-model state prepa-\n\nration scheme in Section II even yields approximate solutions for the fidelity F and the cooling rate \u03b3c of the\nproposed entangling scheme.\nFor simplicity, we assume in the following that all\nthree cooling lasers have the same Rabi frequency \u03a9\nand that the two atomic decay rates, \u03930 and \u03931 , are\nequal. The only remaining spontaneous decay rates are\nthe spontaneous atom decay rate \u0393 and the cavity photon leakage rate \u221a\n\u03ba. For example, the symmetric state\n(|\u03bb0 , +i+|\u03bb0 , \u2212i)/ 2 with one atom in |2i has the sponta\u221a\nneous decay rate \u0393, whilst the state (|\u03bb0 , +i\u2212|\u03bb0 , \u2212i)/ 2\nwith one photon in the cavity decays with \u03ba. We infer from this that the fidelity of the proposed entangling\nscheme depends on the size of both decay rates. Taking\nthis into account, we replace the spontaneous decay rate\n\u0393 in Eq. (20) in the following with the average of \u03ba and\n\u0393,\n\u0393 \u2212\u2192\n\n1\n(\u03ba + \u0393) .\n2\n\n(35)\n\nThe analog of the laser detuning \u2206 in the toy-model state\npreparation scheme is the detuning \u03b4min in Eq.

This implies that ideally one should\nhave\n\u03ba = 2\u0393 ,\n\n(37)\n\nThis result confirms Eq. (34) which suggests that fidelities F close to one are only obtained when g is much\nlarger than all other system parameters.\nThe remainder of this paper confirms these approximate solutions with the help of a numerical analysis of\nthe proposed entangling scheme. The following analysis\nis based on the quantum jump approach [30] which allows\nus to simulate all the possible trajectories of the atomcavity system in Fig. 1. By averaging over many trajectories, we obtain an approximate solution of the master\nequation in Eq. (3). To calculate the no-photon time evolution of the system we use the conditional Hamiltonian\nHcond in Eq. (30). In case of a photon emission we reset\nthe atom-cavity system such that its state after a photon\nemission is on average given by R(%)\u2206t with R(%) as in\nEq. (31). For simplicity, we consider only relatively small\nRabi frequencies. In this way we avoid the population of\nhighly excited states. The population of such states is\nnot expected to decrease the fidelity of the final state\nsince they decay relatively rapidly. However, in this way\nwe can restrict the size of the Hilbert space which has to\nbe taken into account during simulations to states with\nat most three photons in the cavity.\nLet us first have a closer look at how changing the\nrelative size of \u03ba with respect to \u0393 affects the fidelity\nF of the state preparation. Fig. 9 shows F for different spontaneous decay rates \u03ba and \u0393. These are chosen\nsuch that the single-atom cooperativity parameter C in\nEq. (1) remains constant at C = 25. Each data point\n\n(38)\n\nwhen C = 25. We therefore assume that this applies in\nthe remainder of this section.\nThe main result of this subsection is an estimation of\nthe stationary state fidelity of the maximally entangled\natomic state |+i which can be achieved with the proposed entangling scheme. To establish this numerically,\nwe use a series of time evolutions such as those shown\nin Fig. 11 and average over the fidelity once the system\nis approximately in its stationary state. Fig. 10 shows\nthe stationary state fidelity of the target state as a function of the cooperativity parameter C for a constant laser\nRabi frequency \u03a9. The numerical results are compared\nwith the analytical result for F in Eq. (37). Indeed we\nfind very good agreement between analytical and numerical results. It is clear from Fig. 10 that the achievable\nfidelity F increases rapidly with increasing cooperativity\nparameter C. However, fidelities above 90% are possible,\neven for a cooperativity parameter C as low as 20.\nF.\n\nMinimising the state preparation time\n\nAs in Section II, we find that a relatively large cooling\nrate \u03b3c requires relatively large Rabi frequencies. At the\nsame time, we only obtain a fidelity F close to unity\nfor very small Rabi frequencies. In order to maximise\nthe fidelity of the state preparation while maintaining\na substantial cooling rate, we therefore proceed in the\nfollowing as in Section II E and assume a time dependent\nRabi frequency \u03a9. Similarly as in Eq. (22), we assume in\n\n\f11\n0\n\n10\n\n1\u2212F\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nt in units of 1/g\n\nFIG. 11: (a) Logarithmic plot of the time dependence of the\ndistance 1 \u2212 F from the target state |0i for the case where\nthe system is initially in |00, 0i and where \u03ba = 2\u0393 = 0.2 g\nand \u03a9 = 0.03 g.

Fig. 11\nconfirms that choosing a time-dependent Rabi frequency\n\u03a9 indeed improves the speed of the entangling scheme\nwithout sacrificing much of its quality.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we propose an entangling scheme for two\natoms trapped inside an optical cavity. Each atom should\ncontain a \u039b-like level configuration with the ground states\n|0i and |1i forming one qubit and an excited state |2i\n(cf. Fig. 1). Three laser fields should be applied simultaneously. Two of them continuously drive the 0\u20132 transition which is in resonance with the cavity mode, while\nthe third laser drives the 1\u20132 transition. Individual laser\naddressing of the atoms is not required. Most importantly, the laser detunings should be chosen as proposed\nin Eq. (32) in Section III D. As a result, the maximally\nentangled atomic ground state |+, 0i with no photons\nin the cavity becomes the stationary state of the atomcavity system. To complete the state preparation, the\nlaser fields should be turned off after a certain transition time. The presence of non-zero spontaneous decay\nchannels, i.e. the leakage of photons through the cavity\nmirrors and direct spontaneous emission from the atoms,\nare essential for the scheme to work.\nThe proposed state preparation scheme is a concrete\n\nrealisation of a recent proposal to cool atoms into entangled state [23]. Choosing the laser detunings as proposed\nin Eq. (32) guarantees that only the target state |+, 0i\nexperiences off-resonant driving. All other states with\nno population in |2i and in the cavity mode interact resonantly with one of the three applied laser fields. As\nin laser sideband cooling [29], this makes it much more\nlikely for the atom-cavity system to decay into the target\nstate than being driven out of it. As a result, most of\nthe population of the system accumulates in |+, 0i with\nboth atoms in a well-defined, maximally entangled state.\nSince the relevant detuning of this state is essentially\ngiven by the atom-cavity coupling constant g, the analogy to laser sideband cooling suggests that the scheme\nworks best when all other system parameters are much\nsmaller than g.\nDue to laser driving with three different laser fields, it\nis not possible to solve the time evolution of the proposed\nentangling scheme analytically. The reason is that there\nis no interaction picture in which the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem becomes time independent. To obtain at least\napproximate analytical solutions for the cooling rate \u03b3c\nand the stationary state fidelity F (cf. Eq. (37)), Section\nII discusses a closely related state preparation scheme for\na much simpler analytically tractable toy-model. A comparison with this toy-model provides much insight into\nthe state preparation via cooling as well as analytical results. These are confirmed in Section III E by extensive\nnumerical solutions of the time evolution of the atomcavity system in Fig. 1. Section III F finally suggests a\nmethod to speed up the state preparation without sacrificing its fidelity by using time-dependent laser fields\nwith rapidly decreasing Rabi frequencies (cf. Eq. (39)).\nCompared to other recent entangling schemes for\natom-cavity systems [27, 28], the scheme proposed here\npredicts higher fidelities for the same experimental parameters. As illustrated in Fig. 10 in Section III E, it can\nachieve fidelities above 90% even when the single-atom\ncooperativity parameter C is as low as 20. With a cooperativity parameter C = 25 we can achieve a fidelity\nof 93%, while Ref. [27] predicts fidelities above 92% only\nfor C > 50. Ref. [27] uses a similar level scheme as our\nproposal but with the addition of a driven microwave\ntransition between the triplet states. Ref. [28] requires\nthe presence of a magnetic field gradient to produce the\nrequired level splittings to cool atoms into an entangled\nstate. Compared to other quantum computing schemes\nusing dissipation [7\u20139, 11, 13\u201317], the state preparation\nscheme discussed here no longer relies on the detection\nof single photons or macroscopic fluorescence signals to\nherald the success of the state preparation. Its implementation might already be in reach with current technology.\nAcknowledgement. J.
