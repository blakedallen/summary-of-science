INTRODUCTION\n\nIn polymer solutions the overlap of depletion zones for monomers due to repulsive confining walls or mesoscopic particles dissolved in the solution induces an important and tunable\neffective interaction potential [1]. For example, this depletion interaction explains successfully phase diagrams of colloid-polymer mixtures [2\u20134]. Recent experimental techniques\nfacilitate even the measurement of the depletion force between a wall and a single colloidal\nparticle [5\u20137]. In the context of such solutions confined to thin films and porous materials\nthe geometry of two parallel walls has been extensively studied as a paradigmatic case [8\u201314].\nFor strongly overlapping chains as realized in a semidilute polymer solution, chain flexibility is taken into account within self-consistent field theory or within the framework of\nphenomenological scaling theory [15\u201317]. On the other hand, in a dilute polymer solution\ndifferent chains do not overlap so that the behavior of the polymer solution is determined\nby the behavior of a single chain. To a certain extent and under certain circumstances,\na single chain can be modeled by a random walk without self-avoidance (ideal chain). In\nthree dimensions this situation is closely realized in a so-called \u03b8-solvent [18]. If the solvent\ntemperature is below the \u03b8-point (poor solvent) the polymer coils tend to collapse [19,20].\nHowever, in the common case that the solvent temperature is above the \u03b8-point (good solvent) the excluded volume (EV) interaction between chain monomers becomes relevant so\nthat the polymer coils are less compact than the corresponding ideal chains. The emphasis\nin this work is on the latter situation and we investigate the effect of the EV interaction\non the depletion interaction between two parallel walls as compared to the case of confined\nideal chains.\nBy focusing on long flexible chains in a system of mesoscopic size we obtain mostly universal results which are independent of microscopic details [18,21\u201326]. Due to the universality\nof the corresponding properties it is sufficient to choose a simple model for calculating these\nresults. For our investigations we use an Edwards-type model [18,21,22] for the polymer\nchain which allows for an expansion in terms of the EV interaction and which is amenable\nto a field-theoretical treatment via the polymer magnet analogy. The basic elements in this\n[0]\nexpansion are partition functions Zseg (r, r\u2032 ) for chain segments which have no EV interaction\n(as indicated by the superscript [0]) and with the two ends of the segment fixed at r and r\u2032 .\nThis perturbative treatment has to be carried out in presence of confining geometries. We\nconsider two structureless parallel walls in d dimensions and a distance D apart so that in\ncoordinates r = (rk , z) the surface of the bottom wall is located at z = 0 and rk comprises\nthe d \u2212 1 components of r parallel to the walls. The surface of the upper wall is located at\nz = D. The interaction of the polymer with the non-adsorbing walls is implemented by the\nboundary condition that the segment partition function and thus the partition function for\nthe whole chain vanishes as any segment approaches the surface of the walls [18,23], i.e.,\n[0]\nZseg\n(r, r\u2032 ) \u2192 0 ,\n\nz, z \u2032 \u2192 0, D .\n\n(1.1)\n\nFor the present purpose the only relevant property which characterizes one of the polymer\nchains is its mean square end-to-end distance in the bulk solution which we denote by d R2x\n[24\u201326]; for convenience we include the spatial dimension d as a prefactor. The results\npresented in the following are obtained for d = 3 both for ideal chains and for chains with\nEV interaction. In Sec. II we present our results for the interaction potential and the force\n2\n\n\fbetween two parallel walls. We note that for chains with EV interaction these results are\nonly valid in the limit D \u226b Rx because our theoretical approach is not capable to describe\nthe dimensional crossover to the behavior of a quasi d \u2212 1 dimensional system which arises\nfor D \u226a Rx . In Sec. III we compare these results with the simulation data of Milchev and\nBinder [14]. In Sec. IV we apply the Derjaguin approximation in order to obtain from the\nresults in Sec. II the depletion interaction between a spherical particle and a wall in a dilute\npolymer solution and compare it with the corresponding experimental results of Rudhardt,\nBechinger, and Leiderer [6].\nIn view of the complexity of the actual experimental systems involving spatially confined\ncolloidal suspensions dissolved in a solution containing polymers, in the past the corresponding theoretical descriptions relied on suitable coarse-grained, effective models and on\nintegrating out less relevant degrees of freedom. The gross features of these systems can be\nobtained by mapping the polymers onto effective hard spheres as pioneered by Asakura and\nOosawa [27]. In a more refined description Louis et al. [28,29] derived effective interaction\npotentials between polymer coils such that they behave like soft spheres. This approach\nallows one to capture the crossover in structural properties to semidilute and dense polymer\nsolutions. Based on such a model Louis et al. [29] have calculated, inter alia, the corresponding depletion energy between two parallel repulsive plates. Besides presenting the depletion\nenergy for ideal chains in terms of an expansion introduced by Asakura and Oosawa, they\nfind the occurrence of repulsive depletion forces in an intermediate regime of D upon significantly increasing the polymer density. In our present completely analytic study we focus on\ndilute polymer solutions, for which the depletion forces turn out to be always attractive, by\nfully taking into account the flexibility of the polymer chains and the self-avoidance of the\npolymer segments with a particular emphasis on long chains. This complementary point of\nview allows us to make contact to the Monte Carlo simulation data in Ref. [14] and with\nthe experimental data in Ref. [6]; both these comparisons have not been carried out before.\nII. EFFECTIVE INTERACTION BETWEEN PARALLEL WALLS\nA. Grand canonical ensemble\n\nIn a dilute polymer solution the interaction between N different chains can be neglected\nso that the total free energy of the system is N times the free energy of a single chain. We\nconsider the polymer solution within the slit to be in equilibrium contact with an equivalent\npolymer solution in a reservoir outside the slit so that there is exchange of polymer coils\nbetween the slit and the reservoir. The free energy of interaction between the walls in such\na grand canonical ensemble is given by\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nZ|| (D)\nZ|| (D = \u221e)\n\u03b4F = \u2212kB T N ln\n\u2212 ln\n,\nZ\nZ\n(2.1)\nwhere Z|| (D) is the partition function of one polymer chain in a large volume V containing\nthe walls and Z is the corresponding partition function of one polymer chain in the volume\nV without the walls. In the thermodynamic limit V \u2192 Rd one has [24\u201326]\n3\n\n\fZ \u2192 V \u1e90b\n\n(2.2)\n\nR\nwith \u1e90b = Rd dd r \u2032 Zb (r, r\u2032) and where Zb (r, r\u2032) denotes the partition function of one polymer\nchain in the unbounded solution with its ends fixed at r and r\u2032 . Correspondingly Z|| (r, r\u2032)\ndenotes the partition function of one polymer chain within the volume V containing the\nparallel walls and with its ends fixed at r and r\u2032 . The volume V = VI + VO can be divided\ninto the volume VI within the slit and the volume VO outside the slit. Since the polymer\nchain cannot penetrate the walls, whose lateral extensions are large, Z|| (r, r\u2032) is nonzero only\nif both r and r\u2032 are in VI or in VO so that\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\nd \u2032\n\u2032\nd\nZ|| (D) =\nd r d r Z|| (r, r ) =\nd r \u1e90O (z) +\ndd r \u1e90I (z) ,\n(2.3)\nV\n\nV\n\nVO\n\nVI\n\nR\nwith \u1e90O,I (z) = VO,I dd r \u2032 Z|| (r, r\u2032). In the thermodynamic limit V \u2192 Rd the logarithm\nln(Z|| /Z) in Eq. (2.1) can be expanded using Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3), i.e.,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ|| (D) \u2212 Z\nZ|| (D)\n= ln 1 +\n(2.4)\nln\nZ\nZ\n\u0014Z\n\u0013 Z\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 Z|| (D) \u2212 V \u1e90b\n1\n\u1e90O (z)\n\u1e90I (z)\nd\nd\n\u2192\n=\n\u22121 + d r\n\u22121\n,\nd r\nV\nV VO\n\u1e90b\n\u1e90b\n\u1e90b\nVI\nZ (D)\u2212Z\n\nis of the order VI /V which tends to zero because the slit width D\nwhere the ratio || Z\nis fixed. Since in the thermodynamic limit the leading contribution to the first integral of\nEq. (2.4) is independent of the slit width D we find for Eq. (2.1)\n)\n!\n!\n(Z\nZ\n\u1e90\n(z)\n\u1e90\n(z)\nI\nI\n,\n(2.5)\n\u22121 \u2212\n\u22121\ndd r\n\u03b4F = \u2212np kb T\ndd r\n\u1e90b\n\u1e90b\nVI\nVI\nD=\u221e\nwith the number density np = N/V of the polymer chains in the bulk solution. The second integral in Eq. (2.5) reduces to the sum of two half-space (HS) integrals which yield\ncontributions proportional to the area A of the walls [25]:\n!\n!\nZ\nZ\n\u1e90I (z)\n\u2206\u03c3\n\u1e90HS (z)\nd\nd\nd r\n=2\nd r\n\u22121\n\u2212 1 = \u22122A\n,\n(2.6)\nnp kB T\n\u1e90b\n\u1e90\nVI\nHS\nb\nD=\u221e\nwhere we have introduced the surface tension \u2206\u03c3 between the polymer solution and the\nconfining wall [compare Eqs. (1.7) and (2.41) in Ref. [25]]. Note that the mean polymer\ndensity within the slit is determined by the bulk density np , i.e., in the grand canonical\nensemble the chemical potential \u03bc of the polymer coils is fixed instead of the number NI of\npolymer coils in the slit (see Subsec.

Free energy of interaction and mean force\n\nWe employ the polymer magnet analogy [18,21\u201325] in order to calculate the partition\nfunctions \u1e90HS (z), \u1e90I (z), and \u1e90b as needed in Eqs. (2.5), (2.6), and (2.8) for a single chain\nwith EV interaction. They are functions of the parameter u0 which characterizes the strength\nof the EV interaction and L0 which determines the number of monomers of the chain such\nthat L0 equals R2g = R2x / 2 for an ideal chain in the bulk, i.e., for u0 = 0. The wellknown arguments of the polymer magnet analogy [18,21\u201323] imply for the present case the\ncorrespondence\nZ|| (r, r\u2032; L0 , D, u0) = Lt0 \u2192L0 h\u03a61 (r)\u03a61 (r\u2032 )i\n\nN =0\n\n(2.14)\n\nbetween Z|| (r, r\u2032) and the two-point correlation function h\u03a61 (r)\u03a61 (r\u2032 )i in a O(N ) symmetric\nfield theory for an N -component order parameter field \u03a6 = (\u03a61 , ... , \u03a6N ) in the restricted\nvolume VI . In Eq. (2.14) the operator\nZ\n1\nLt0 \u2192L0 =\ndt0 eL0 t0\n(2.15)\n2\u03c0i C\nacting on the correlation function is an inverse Laplace transform with C a path in the\ncomplex t0 -plane to the right of all singularities of the integrand. The Laplace-conjugate\nt0 of L0 and the excluded volume strength u0 appear, respectively, as the 'temperature'\nparameter and as the prefactor of the (\u03a62 )2 -term in the Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nt0 2 u0 2 2\n1\n2\nd\n(2.16)\n(\u2207\u03a6) + \u03a6 + (\u03a6 )\nH{\u03a6} =\nd r\n2\n2\n24\nV\nwhich provides the statistical weight exp(\u2212H{\u03a6}) for the field theory. The requirement in\nEq. (1.1) describing the repulsive character of the walls imposes the Dirichlet condition\n\u03a6(r) = 0 ,\n\nz = 0, D ,\n\n(2.17)\n\non both walls. This corresponds to the fixed point boundary condition of the so-called\nordinary transition [31,32] for the field theory. For the renormalization group improved\nperturbative investigations we use a dimensionally regularized continuum version of the field\ntheory which we shall renormalize by minimal subtraction of poles in \u03b5 = 4 \u2212 d [33]. The\nbasic element of the perturbation expansion is the Gaussian two-point correlation function\n(or propagator) h\u03a6i (r) \u03a6j (r\u2032 )i[0] where the subscript [0] denotes u0 = 0 [see Eq. (A1) in\nAppendix A].\nThe loop expansion to first order in u0 and the renormalization of \u03c9 in Eq. (2.8) is\ncompletely analogous to that outlined in Subsec. II A of Ref. [25]. Some key results of this\nprocedure relevant for the present case are given in Appendix A. The final result for fs and\n\u03b4f on the rhs of Eq. (2.9a) are given by Eqs. (A6) and (A7) in Appendix A, where N = 0\nfor the present polymer case and \u03b5 = 1 in d = 3.\nFigure 1 shows the universal scaling function for the free energy of interaction\n\u0398(y) =\n\n1\n\u03b4f\nRx\n6\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fwith \u03b4f from Eq.

For\nchains with EV interaction the present theoretical approach is only amenable to capture\nthe behavior for D/Rx large, i.e., y \u226b 1. As expected the depletion potential and the\nresulting force is weaker for chains with EV interaction than for ideal chains, because the\nEV interaction effectively reduces the depletion effect of the walls. The inset of Fig. 1 shows\nboth \u0398 and \u0393 for ideal chains.

But whether the\nbulk contribution D fb has to be taken into account in addition depends on the 'experimental'\nsetup. In the case that the force is measured between plates immersed in a container filled\nwith the dilute polymer solution such that solvent and polymer coils can freely enter the slit\nfrom the reservoir, only the scaling functions \u0398 and \u0393 are relevant. This is also true for the\nparticle wall geometry discussed in Sec. IV. But if no exchange is allowed as for the Monte\nCarlo simulation discussed in Sec. III the force K defined in Eq. (3.2) is needed.\nIII. COMPARISON WITH MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS\n\nMonte Carlo simulations of polymers are well established both for ideal chains and for\nchains with self-avoidance. In this section we compare our results with the simulation of a\npolymer chain between two repulsive walls by Milchev and Binder [14] which corresponds\nto the case studied theoretically here. These authors use a bead spring model for the selfavoiding polymer chain with a short-ranged repulsive interaction between the beads.\n7\n\n\fIn Refs. [9] and [14] (see in particular Fig. 4 in Ref. [14]) it is stated that the total force\nK between the two walls is repulsive and diverges in the narrow slit limit, i.e.,\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121/\u03bd\nDK\nD\n\u221d\n,\n(3.1)\nkB T\nRg\nwhere \u03bd = 12 for ideal chains and \u03bd = 0.588 for chains with EV interaction and Rg is the\nradius of gyration of the polymer chain in unbounded space [14]. [For the definition of Rg\nsee Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) in Sec. IV.] The qualitative difference to the scaling function \u0393(y)\npresented for the force in Subsec. II C is explained by the following arguments. (a) The total\nforce between the walls is repulsive due to the contribution from the cost in free energy\ncaused by the loss of the total available space for the polymer chains within the slit, i.e.,\nthe bulk pressure \u2212fb contributes to the total force. (b) The total force K diverges due to\nthe change from the grand canonical to the canonical ensemble (see Subsec. II B). In the\nsimulation in Ref. [14] the number NI of polymers in the slit is given by one polymer in the\nslit volume. Therefore we obtain the total force K by differentiating Eq. (2.13) with respect\nto the slit width D and by setting NI = 1, i.e.,\nDK\n1 d\n=\n(D \u03c9) ,\nkB T\n\u03c9 dD\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere D \u03c9 = \u2212\u03a9/(np kB T A) is given by the rhs of Eq. (2.9a) in conjunction with Eqs. (A6)\nand (A7) in Appendix A. The lhs of Eq. (3.2) corresponds to the quantity Df in Ref. [14].\nFigure 2 shows the comparison of the simulation data of Ref. [14] and the corresponding\ntheoretical result from Eq. (3.2), the latter both for ideal chains and chains with EV interaction. Note that the theoretical curve for chains with EV interaction is only valid for large\nD/Rg . The curve for chains with EV interaction is closer to the simulation data than the\ncurve for ideal chains, in agreement with the fact that the polymer chain in the simulation\nis a self-avoiding one. One possible reason for the remaining deviation might be that the\nchain in the simulation is too short to be fully described by the present field-theoretical\napproach. The deviation of the Monte Carlo simulation data at large values of D/Rg from\nthe power-law behavior at small values of D/Rg (dashed line) occurs because kDK\ntends to\nBT\n1 for large D/Rg , which is not captured by Eq. (3.1).\nFigures 5 \u2212 9 of Ref. [14] show density profiles for the simulated chains with EV interaction, including a comparison with the analytical result for the profile of ideal chains in the\nslit (Fig. 9 in Ref. [14]). We want to mention here that the field-theoretical treatment of the\nmonomer density for chains with EV interaction requires a perturbation expansion involving\nintegrals over G \u2217 G \u2217 G \u2217 G instead of G \u2217 G \u2217 G (see Appendix A) and thus in view of the\ntechnical challenges is beyond the scope of the present study. Alternative information about\nthe monomer density profiles beyond the ideal behavior can be found in Ref. [34] in which a\nself-consistent mean-field approximation is used to obtain the monomer density profiles for\na single polymer chain between two repulsive walls.\nIV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT\n\nRudhardt, Bechinger, and Leiderer [6] have measured the depletion interaction between\na wall and a colloidal particle immersed in a dilute solution of nonionic polymer chains in a\n8\n\n\fgood solvent by means of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM). They monitored the\nfluctuations of the relative distance of the colloid particle from the wall induced by Brownian\nmotion. From the resulting Boltzmann distribution one can infer the corresponding effective\ndepletion potential between the repulsive wall and the particle.\nIn order to compare these experimental data with our results we apply the Derjaguin\napproximation [35]. In the limit that the radius R of the spherical particle is much larger\nthan both Rx and the distance a of closest approach surface-to-surface between the particle\nand the wall, the particle can be regarded as composed of a pile of fringes. Each fringe\nbuilds a fringe-like slit with distance D = a + r||2 /(2R), where r|| is the radius of the fringe.\nThus the interaction between the particle and the wall is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n\u03a6depl (a)\n\u03c52\na\n2\n,\n(4.1)\n= 2\u03c0R Rx\n+\nd\u03c5 \u03c5 \u0398\nnp kB T\nRx\n2\n0\nwhere \u03c5 is a dimensionless variable and \u0398(y) is the scaling function for the free energy of\ninteraction for the slit geometry [see Eq. (2.18)].\nIn Ref. [6] the interaction potential \u03a6depl (a) is measured for nonionic polymer chains in\na good solvent for polymer number densities np = 0, 7.6, 10.2, 12.7, and 25.5 \u03bcm\u22123 . All\nthese polymer number densities represent a dilute polymer solution so that \u03a6depl (a) is a\nlinear function of np [see Eq. (2.1)]. Therefore our results are applicable and Fig. 3 shows\n\u03a6depl /np as a function of a. The crosses in Fig. 3 correspond to those values of a for which\nthe above mentioned linear behavior \u03a6depl \u221d np (not shown) is in good agreement with\nthe experimental data. Deviations from the linear behavior \u03a6depl \u221d np for small and large\nparticle-wall distances a (not shown) can be explained by the experimental method TIRM\nused in Ref. [6]: a higher interaction potential implies a lower probability to find the particle\nat the corresponding distance causing lower accuracy. It turns out that the total interaction\npotential as the sum of depletion potential, electrostatic repulsion, and gravity is highest\nfor short and large distances, which are those where the linear relationship \u03a6depl \u221d np is not\nconfirmed experimentally. Figure 3 also shows the corresponding theoretical predictions for\nthe experimental data, both for ideal polymer chains and chains with EV interaction, i.e.,\nchains in a good solvent as realized in the experiment. Note that all parameters entering\nthese theoretical predictions are fixed by available experimental data for np , a, and Rg , i.e.,\nthere are no freely adjustable parameters. In particular, the radius of gyration Rg of the\npolymer chains used in Ref. [6] has been measured fairly accurately by means of small angle\nscattering of x-rays [36], resulting in Rg = 0.101\u03bcm. According to the definition of Rg as\nmeasured in small angle scattering experiments [37], i.e.,\nR 3 R 3 \u2032\nd r d r \u03c1(r)\u03c1(r\u2032 )|r \u2212 r\u2032 |2\nR\nR\n,\n(4.2)\nR2g =\n2 d3 r d3 r \u2032 \u03c1(r)\u03c1(r\u2032 )\n\nwhere \u03c1(r) is the monomer density, in d = 3 one has [38]\nRg = 0.6927 Rx ,\n\nd=3.\n\n(4.3)\n\nFigure 3 shows that the experimental data of Ref. [6] deviate from the theoretical result\nderived here. Note that this deviation is not visible if the polymer size is used as a freely\nadjustable parameter in order to gain agreement between the experimental and theoretical\n9\n\n\fdata. The theoretical curve for chains with EV interaction, as realized in the experiment,\nis even further away from the experimental data than the theoretical curve for ideal chains.\nThe latter observation confirms the necessity of reinterpreting of the experimental data,\ne.g., by adjusting the radius of gyration. This can be done such that agreement with the\ntheoretical data for chains with EV interaction is gained for the intermediate values of the\ndistance where the linear relationship \u03a6depl \u221d np allows for a direct comparison with the\ntheory. [The remaining differences outside this intermediate regime (\u25e6) pose a separate issue\nas discussed in the paragraph following Eq. (4.1).] However the difference between the two\ntheoretical curves for ideal chains and chains with EV interaction is small compared to the\ndeviation from the experimental data.\nAny attempt to use the Monte Carlo data obtained in Ref. [14] for predicting the depletion interaction between a colloidal particle and a wall would require two integrations of K\nand a change to the grand canonical ensemble, which poses prohibitive accuracy problems.\nNonetheless a qualitative statement can be given easily. Figure 2 shows that the force obtained in the Monte Carlo simulation is weaker than the force calculated for chains with EV\ninteraction. This is also expected to hold for the depletion interaction between a particle\nand the wall.\nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUMMARY\n\nBased on field-theoretical techniques we have determined the effective depletion interaction between two non-adsorbing walls confining a dilute solution of long flexible polymer\nchains. Our main results are:\n1. The field-theoretical calculation yields the universal scaling functions of the depletion\ninteraction potential and the corresponding force for ideal chains and for chains with\nexcluded volume interaction in the limit y = D/Rx \u226b 1 , where D is the separation between the walls and Rx is the projected end-to-end distance of the chains [see\nEqs. (2.18), (2.19), and (4.3) and Fig. 1]. The depletion potential is weaker for chains\nin a good solvent than for ideal chains.\n2. For y & 1 we find fair agreement with corresponding Monte Carlo simulation data\n[14] if the excluded volume interaction is taken into account (see Fig. 2). We surmise\nthat remaining discrepancies are due to higher order terms in the field-theoretical\ncalculation which are not yet taken into account and due to the possibility that the\nlength of the simulated polymer chain has not yet reached the scaling limit for which\nthe field theory is valid.\n3. Using the Derjaguin approximation we have compared our theoretical results with the\nexperimental data [6] for the depletion potential between a spherical colloidal particle\nand a wall (see Fig. 3). We obtain a fair agreement only if the radius of gyration Rg of\nthe polymers is used as a fit parameter. This value, however, differs from independently\ndetermined values for Rg . The reasons for these differences are not yet understood.\nThe excluded volume interaction between the monomers of the polymer chain plays\nonly a minor role for reaching agreement between theory and experiment.\n\n10\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank A.
