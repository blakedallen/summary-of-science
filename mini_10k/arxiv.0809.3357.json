Batch codes were first presented by Ishai, Kushilevita,\nOstrovsky and Sahai [1] in STOC'04. In this paper we answer some of the questions put\nforward by Paterson, Stinson and Wei and give some results for the general case t > 1\nwhich were not studied by the authors.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBatch codes were proposed by Ishai, Kushilevita, Ostrovsky and Sahai [1]. Suppose there\nexists a large database of n items distributed in m devices. A user has to choose an arbitrary\nsubset of k items such that she can read at most t items from each device. The problem is\nto distribute the items in the database such that the total storage N is minimized. Batch\ncodes are constructed for this purpose. Paterson, Stinson and Wei [2] gave a combinatorial\nformulation of the above problem and introduced the study of Combinatorial batch codes.\nThey studied the special case when t = 1. In this paper we extend their work to study\ncombinatorial batch codes for arbitrary t. We also give solutions to some of the questions\nraised by them.\nBatch codes can be defined as follows:\nP\nDefinition\n1 [2, Section 1] An (n, N, k, m, t) batch code\nencodes a string\nP\u2217 over an alphabet\nPn\n(also referred to as servers) of total\ninto an m \u2212 tuple of strings y1 , y2 , . . . , ym \u2208\nx\u2208\nlength N , such that for each k \u2212 tuple (batch) of distinct indices i1 , i2 , . . . , ik \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n},\nthe entries xi1 , xi2 , * * * , xik from x can be decoded by reading at most t symbols from each\nserver.\nOur aim is to minimize N . In [2], Paterson, Stinson and Wei initiated the study of\nCombinatorial Batch Codes which is combinatorial formulation of the replication based Batch\ncodes as proposed by Ishai, Kushilevita, Ostrovsky and Sahai [1]. Combinatorial Batch codes\ncan be defined as follows:\nDefinition 2 [2, Section 1] An (n, N, k, m, t) combinatorial batch code (CBC) is a set system\n(X, B), where X is a set P\nof n elements (called items), B is a collection of m subsets of X\n(called servers) and N = B\u2208B |B|, such that for each k-subset {xi1 , xi2 , . . . , xik } \u2282 X there\nexists a subset Ci \u2286 Bi , where |Ci | \u2264 t, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, such that\nS\n{xi1 , xi2 , * * * , xik } \u2282 m\ni=1 Ci\n1\n\n\fCombinatorial batch codes can be represented as follows : The items are represented by\npoints of the set system and the servers are represented by subsets of these points. We follow\nthe conventions as given in [2]. We consider the dual set system, in which the servers are\nrepresented by points and each item in a database is represented by a set (referred to as a\nblock ) containing the points (i.e., the servers) that stores that item.\nGiven a set system (X, B) with X = {x1 , x2 , * * * , xn } and B = (B1 , B2 , * * * , Bb ), the\nincidence matrix of (X, B) is a b \u00d7 n matrix A = (ai,j ), where\n(\n1 if xj \u2208 Bi\nai,j =\n0 if xj \u2208\n/ Bi\nPaterson, Stinson and Wei considered the special case where t = 1. They represented\n(n, N, k, m, 1) by (n, N, k, m)-CBC. We also follow this convention. Additionally, we represent\n(n, N, k, m, t) by (n, N, k, m)t -CBC for t > 1. The (n, N, k, m)-CBC is optimal if N \u2264 N \u2032 for\nall (n, N \u2032 , k, m)-CBC and we denote the corresponding value of N by N (n, k, m). Similarly\nwe denote the optimal value of a (n, N, k, m)t -CBC by Nt (n, k, m) for t > 1.\nA set if positions in a matric is called a transversal, if it contains one position in each row\nand in each column. We state the important lemma given in [2].\nLemma 1 [2][Section 1.1] An m \u00d7 n 0-1 matrix is an incidence matrix of an (n, N, k, m)CBC if and only if, for any k columns, there is a k \u00d7 k sub matrix which has at least one\ntransversal containing k ones.\nRefer to exmaple 1. If we consider any four columns say 12, 25, 40, and 55, then a\ntransversal can be obtained as shown in the figure 1 below.\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: One way of choosing k columns.\nThe rate of a code is defined as the ratio c = n/N . We define column uniform Batch\nCodes as batch codes which have the same number of ones in all the columns. If c be the rate\nthen there are exactly 1/c ones in each column. This also implies that each item is replicated\n1/c times and stored in servers. We denote by n(m, c, k) and nt (m, c, k), the maximum values\nof n for which there exists a uniform (n, cn, k, m)-CBC and nt (n, cn, k, m)-CBC respectively.\n\n1.1\n\nPrevious results\n\nWe present the results given by Paterson, Stinson and Wei [2].\n1.

We also present some column uniform batch\ncodes with fixed rate 1/3. This question was also posed by Paterson, Stinson and Wei.\nIn their paper [2], the authors considered the case t = 1.

They\nm \u0001\nm \u0001\nshowed that if n \u2265 (k \u2212 1) k\u22121 , then N (n, k, m) = kn \u2212 (k \u2212 1) k\u22121 .\nm \u0001\nm \u0001\n.\n\u2264 n \u2264 (k \u2212 1) k\u22122\nWe extend this result for values of n such that k\u22122\nWe say that s columns span l rows if the s blocks span l points. This means that s blocks\ntogether contain l points. Putting another way, s items are contained\u0001in l servers. First\nm\n. We observe that\nwe try to find the exact values of N (n, m, k) for n close to (k \u2212 1) k\u22121\nm \u0001\nwhen n = (k \u2212 1) k\u22121 , then each column of the incidence matrix contains k \u2212 1 ones and is\nrepeated k \u2212 1 times. The reason behind this is that any two distinct columns span at least\nk rows. If k columns\nare selected at least two will be distinct and hence will span k rows. We\n\u0001\nm\nsay that k\u22121 distinct columns belong to the same group. So there are k \u2212 1 groups.\nWe denote a column i of the\nincidence matrix of a CBC by (a1,i a2,i . . . am,i )T .\n\u0001\nm\ncolumns in a given block then, the number of columns which\nIf we consider all the k\u22121\nwill have ones in the same k \u2212 1 rows is 1, the number of distinct columns which will have\nones in the same k \u2212 2 rows will be m \u2212 (k \u0001\u2212 2).

We show that if such a construction is made, then any\nk columns will span k rows.\nWe consider the three possible cases.\n1. If we consider any k columns such that replica of the deleted/modified column(s) is not\nchosen, then any two of them will be distinct. As shown previously they will span k\nrows.\n2. If one or more columns are so selected that the replica of the deleted column has been\nselected and the modified column is not selected then atleast two distinct columns will\nbe selected. So any k columns will span at least k rows.\n3. So now we consider that the modified column is selected. Here two cases arise.\n(a) The k \u2212 2 selected columns are the same as the modified column (chosen from the\nother groups) and one column is selected at random. Since there are atleast two\ndistinct columns containing k \u2212 1 ones, the k columns will span k rows.\n\n(b) The k \u2212 1 columns are selected at random, then atleast two will be distinct. So\nthe k columns will span k rows.\nWe note that there are k \u2212 2 duplicate columns which will have ones in the same position as\nthe modified column. These k \u2212 2 columns together with the modified column will span k \u2212 1\nrows. However if we select any other row then all the k columns will span k rows. From this\nthe Theorem follows.\nTheorem 2 If n = (k \u2212 1)\n\n\u0001\n\nm\nk\u22121\n\n\u2212 (m \u2212 k + 1), then N (n, m, k) = n(k \u2212 1) \u2212 1.\n\nm \u0001\nWe now present a construction which gives us the optimal value for any n where k\u22122\n\u2264\nm \u0001\nn \u2264 (k \u2212 1) k\u22121 .

If we delete less than m \u2212 k + 1 = 3 columns say columns 59,60, then\nn = 58 and N = n(k \u2212 1). We delete the columns 56,59,60 and modify the column 50, such\nthat it now contains 2 ones in rows 5 and 6. So now n = 57 and N = n(k \u2212 1) \u2212 1, We\ndelete the columns 58,55 and modify the column 49, such that it now contains 2 ones in rows\n4 and 6. We see that the if the columns 20, 40, and modified columns 49 and 50 are selected,\nthen the four columns span only three rows. By construction we delete column 40. So now\nn = 54 and N = n(k \u2212 1) \u2212 2. In the third step we delete the columns 57, 54 and 20 and\nmodify the column 48 such that new column has only two ones in rows 4 an 5. For n = 55, 56,\nN = n(k \u2212 1) \u2212 2. This gives n = 51 and N = n(k \u2212 1) \u2212 3. In the next few steps we delete\nthe following columns.

The reason for selecting m \u2212 k columns\nfrom the same group and one column from another group for deletion in Step 3 is that, if we\nk\u22123\nm\u2212k+2\nk\u22122\nm\u2212k+1\nk\u22121\nm\u2212k+1\nz }| { z }| {\nz }| { z }| {\nz }| { z }| {\nT\nT\nchoose the column (00 * * * 0 10 11 * * * 1) , (00 * * * 0 11 * * * 1) , and the column (00 * * * 0 11 * * * 1)T\nk \u2212 2 times then the k columns will span only k \u2212 1 rows, which is undesirable.

When we consider the columns which have a one in the\nm \u2212 k + 2-th row in the same group then we note that i such columns in the same group have\nbeen already deleted in the previous steps. So we delete m \u2212 k + 1 \u2212 i = m \u2212 k \u2212 i + 1 of the\nremaining columns having one in the m \u2212 k \u2212 i + 2-th row and k \u2212 2 ones in the same k \u2212 2\nrows. We modify the remaining one column. However in this process we can observe that k\ncolumns can be selected such that they span only k \u2212 1 rows. Hence i other columns have\nto be deleted from other groups ( as done in step 4). Thus each step we delete m \u2212 k + 1\ncolumns.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nm\u22121\nm\u22121\nAfter m\u22121\nk\u22122 steps we will be left with (k \u2212 1) k\u22122 , such that k\u22122 columns will have\n7\n\n\fk \u2212 2 ones and the rest have k \u2212 1 ones (with one\nin the first column).

This means that every item is stored in exactly three\nservers.\nWe think of the points as vertices of a graph. Any three points which lie in the same\nblock correspond to a triangle in the graph. For any block b such that ax,b = ay,b = az,b = 1\nand ai,b = 0 for i = {1, 2, . . . , m}\\{x, y, z}, there is a triangle xyz in the corresponding graph.\nFrom Corollary 3.3 and 3.5 of [2] we see that\n\u0001\n1. n(m, 3, 4) = 3 m\n3\n\u0001\n2. n(m, 3, 5) = m\n3\n\nWe next try to find some values for n(m, 3, 6). The question of finding a valid (n, 3n, k, m)CBC thus boils down to finding a graph such that any k triangles in the graph must span\natleast k vertices. More importantly, we are interested in finding the graph on n vertices\nwhich has the maximum number of triangles such that any k triangles in the graph will span\natleast k points.\nWe give a construction for a column uniform CBC which has rate equal to 1/3. We note\nthat the graph K4 has four triangles. So any four triangles span atleast four vertices. Let\nm = 8. Then the graph G8 (Refer to Figure 2) has 16 triangles such that any 6 triangles\nspans atleast 6 points. So there exists a (16, 48, 6, 8) \u2212 CBC.\n\nFigure 2: The graph G8 .\nNow we consider the graphs G8 and K4 as units. The units have be interconnected as\nshown in the Figure 3.\n8\n\n\fFigure 3: A unit consisting of G8 and K4\nWe replace the graphs G8 and K4 by an octagons and squares. If there are g octagons\nand s squares, then there will be 8g + 4s vertices and 16g + 4s + 4e triangles, where e is the\nnumber of common edges between faces. The calculation of e will be done in the following\nway.\n\nFigure 4: The pattern of octagon and square.\nWe refer to the Figure 4 below. Level d denotes the octagons and squares at a distance d\nfrom the central octagon. Consider a graph with only one level. We see that the number of\noctagons and squares at distance one is four each. Number of common edges between faces\nis 16. We thus note that g = 5, s = 4 and e = 16. So if m = 8.5 + 4.4 = 56, then the number\nof triangles present in the original graph is 160. So n(56, 3, 6) = 16.5 + 4.4 + 64 \u2265 160. For a\ngraph with level two, the number of octagons and squares is 8 each. So g = 13, s = 12, e = 56.\nSo (152, 3, 6) \u2265 480. To generalize at distance d, number of octagons and squares is 4d each.\n9\n\n\fg = 1 + 2d(d + 1), s = 2d(d + 1), e = (8(g \u2212 4d) + 4(s \u2212 4d))/2 + 8d + (4d + 3(4d \u2212 4) + 4)/2.\nLet m = 8g + 4s, then n(m, 3, 6) \u2265 16g + 4s + 4e, where g = 1 + 2d(d + 1), s = 2d(d + 1),\ne = 4g + 2s \u2212 8d \u2212 4.\nGiven the value of m, we find lower bound\u221afor (m, 3, 6) in the following way.\n24+\n\n242 +96(m\u22128)\n\nThe distance can be calculated as d = \u230a\n\u230b. g = 1+2d(d+1), s = 2d(d+1),\n48\ne = 4g + 2s \u2212 8d \u2212 4.\nLet \u2206\u2032 = 16g + 4s + 4e, m\u2032 = m \u2212 (8g + 4s), j = m\u2032 (mod 8), then,\n\u2206 = \u2206\u2032 + oct(j) + l\u2032 (j) + \u2206\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0 for j = 1, 2,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 for j = 3,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f24 for j = 4,\n1 for j = 1\noct(j) = 5 for j = 5,\n, l\u2032 (j) =\n, \u2206\u2032\u2032 = max {8s\u2032 + 20i + 4l},\ni=1\n\uf8f4\n4\notherwise\n\uf8f4\nto\u2308m\u2032 /8\u2309\n\uf8f4\n6\nfor\nj\n=\n6,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n10 for j = 7,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n16 for j = 8,\n\uf8f1\n(\n\uf8f4\n7 for j = 1, 2 and i + s\u2032 + 1 = 8,\n\uf8f2\n0 for j = 1, 2,\nm\u2032 \u22128i\n\u2032\nwhere s = \u230a 4 \u230b, l = u + s\u2032 + i for j 6= 1, 2 and i + u + s\u2032 = 8, and u =\n\uf8f4\n1 otherwise\n\uf8f3\nu + s\u2032 + i \u2212 1 otherwise.\n\n4\n\nOptimal values of N for t > 2\n\nWe generalize the problem to find Nt (n, m, k) which was not done in [2].\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n\nFrom the above matrix we see that we can four elements from any four columns by selecting\na maximum of two elements from each row.\nWe give optimal value when m = n. This is a trivial case and for any t we can state the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 4 Nt (n, k, n) = n\nWe next show the present the following example.\nExample 2 The following represents the incidence matrix corresponding to N2 (10, 5, 5).\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n10\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n.\n\n\fFrom the example it is very easy to see that\nTheorem 5 If n \u2264 tk, then Nt (n, k, k) = n.\nNext we present results for column uniform batch codes with fixed rates. Let us consider\nthe fixed rate c = 2. Suppose we can choose a maximum\u0001 of t elements from each server. We\nconstruct the incidence matrix such that each of the m\n2 combinations is repeated. We can\nsee that on choosing 2t columns in the worst case we can choose the same combination 2t\ntimes. Suppose this combination takes into consideration the first and the second rows. Then\nwe can select t ones each from the first and second rows. This essentially means we have\nchosen 2t items taking t item from each of the first and second servers. From this we arrive\nat the following theorem.\nTheorem 6 nt (m, 2, 2t) = \u221e.\nAs a consequence for k < 2t, we can choose the k items in any way we like such that at most\nt items are selected from each of the servers(columns).\nCorollary 1 If k \u2264 2t, nt (m, 2, k) = \u221e.\n\u0001\n1. nt (m, c, ct + i) = ct m\nc , for i \u2264 t\n\u0001\n2. nt (m, c, ct + t + j) = t m\nc , for j \u2264 t\n\u0001\n3. nt (m, c, k) < m\nc , if k > tm\n\u0001\nProof\u0001 : There are m\nc ones. We show that nt (m, c, ct +\nc distinct columns each having\nm\u0001\ncolumns\nct times. Now if we select\n,\nfor\ni\n\u2264\nt.\nWe\ncan\nreplicate\neach\nof\nthe\ni) \u2265 ct m\nc\nc\nany ct columns columns which are replicas then\u0001we can choose t ones from each of the c\nrows and get a valid CBC. So nt (m, c, ct) \u2265 ct m\nc . If k = ct + i, i \u2264 t, then we can chosen\nct columns which are replicates and any other i columns. Suppose we choose the column\nm\u2212c\nc\u22121\nm\u2212c\u22121\nc\nz }| { z }| {\nz }| { z }| {\nT\n(11 * * * 1 00 * * * 0) ct times and the column (11 * * * 1 01 00 * * * 0)T i (i \u2264 t times then the ones\ncan be selected from the c + 1 rows a maximum of t times. So we get a valid CBC. Any\n\u0001 other\nchoice of ct + i columns will also give rise to a valid CBC. So nt (m, c, ct + i) \u2265 ct m\nc , when\ni \u2264 t.\n\u0001\nm\u0001\nWe show that nt (m, c, ct + i) \u2264 ct m\nc , when i \u2264 t. Suppose atleast one of the\nc\ncolumns be repeated ct + 1 times. For k > ct, let the choose columns include all the ct + 1\ncolumns. Then at least one\n\u0001 server contributes more than t items, which is a contradiction.\nSo nt (m, c, ct + i) \u2264 ct m\nc , when i \u2264 t.\nHence the Part 1 of the theorem follows.\nThe proof of Part 2 is similar to Part\u0001 1.\nConsider k > tm. If nt (m, c, k) \u2265 m\nc , then any k columns will span only m rows. Since\nk > tm, at least any two rows contribute more than t elements, which violates the condition\nthat of combinatorial batch codes.\nCorollary 3.3 and 3.5 of [2] is a special case of the above Theorem 7 when t = 1.\nComment We give below a table which compares the storage N for t = 1 and t = 2. We\nobserve that the storage space required when t = 1 is about two times than when t = 2. This\nshows that for storage efficiency we can increase the number of probes. However we may note\nthat for load balancing the number of probes cannot be too large.\n\nTheorem 7\n\n11\n\n\fn\n180\n180\n720\n240\n\nm\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nk\n5\n6\n7\n9\n\nN (t = 1)\n640\n684\n4185\n1860\n\nN (t = 2)\n360\n360\n2160\n720\n\nFrom Theorem 7 it follows that\n\u0001\n1. n2 (m, 2, 5) = 4 m\n2\n\u0001\n2. n2 (m, 2, 6) = 4 m\n2\n\u0001\n3. n2 (m, 2, 7) = 2 m\n2\n\u0001\n4. n2 (m, 2, 8) = 2 m\n2\n\nWe next try to find out the values of n2 (m, 2, 9) and n2 (m, 2, 10). We note that n2 (m, 2, k) \u2264\nk > 10.\nWe look at the graph in Figures 5(a) and 5(b). The graph does not have any triangle or\nsquare.\nm\u0001\n2 ,\n\n(a) Square and triangle free (b) Square and triangle free\ngraph on 9 vertices\ngraph on 11 vertices\n\nFigure 5: Square triangle free graphs\nFrom this the following Lemma 3 follows. The lemma is important in proving Theorem 8.\nLemma 3 Let G be a graph on v vertices. Then the maximum number of edges such that G\ndoes not any triangle or square is greater than 2 + 3\u230a(v \u2212 3)/2\u230b.\n\u0001\nTheorem 8\n1. n2 (m, 2, 9) \u2265 m\n2 + 2\u230am/3\u230b.\n\u0001\n2. n2 (m, 2, 10) \u2265 m\n2 + 2 + 3\u230a(m \u2212 3)/2\u230b.\n\u0001\nProof : If we consider all possible two combinations, then there are m\n2 columns. We\n\u0001\nnote that 52 = 10. So if 9 elements\u0001 are selected atleast five servers must\ncontribute maximum\nm\nm\u0001\ntwo elements. So n2 (m, 2, 9) \u2265 2 . Similarly for \u0001n2 (m, 2, 10) \u2265 2 .\nLet the incidence matrix containing all the m\n2 columns be denoted by A. Now we try to\nfind if we can add more columns containing two ones each. We represent the new augmented\nincidence matrix by A\u2032 = (a\u2032i,j ). We map the incidence matrix to a graph, such that columns\nrepresent the edges. An edge i is incident on two vertices e and f if a\u2032e,i = a\u2032f,i = 1. We have\nconsidered the cases when all the k items represent columns in A. Now we consider some\nitems to be selected from A\u2032 as well. A\u2032 is a sub matrix of A constructed taking some columns\nof A.\nWe first prove Part 2. We are interested in finding the maximum number of columns that\nwe must select from A to form A\u2032 such that all the conditions of combinatorial batch codes\n12\n\n\fare met. If all the k elements are selected from A\u2032 , then we have a valid code. So we select\nsome elements from A and some from A\u2032 . In particular we consider the condition where the\nsame row is selected from the matrices A and A\u2032 . The length of A\u2032 can be analyzed once\nwe consider this situation. We note that if we select items such that they belong to five or\nmore servers, then it is clear that a maximum of two items are selected from each server. So\nwe consider the situation in which items are selected from four servers. Now we try to see\nwhich columns can be replicated. At the maximum six columns can be selected from A such\nthat the columns span only four rows. If another four columns are so chosen as shown that\nthey belong to the same row, then the ten chosen columns will span at the maximum four\nrows giving an invalid CBC. We call such combinations the forbidden configurations. Thus\ncolumns can be replicated such that the underlying graph does not contain any subgraph as\nthe forbidden configurations. The forbidden configurations are graphs on four vertices with\nfour edges as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Forbidden configuration : graphs on four vertices which contain four edges.\nFrom the graphs we see that there can be no triangle or square. From Lemma 3 we see\nthat the maximum number\n\u0001 of edges in a graph having no triangle or square is 2+3\u230a(v \u22123)/2\u230b.\nThus n2 (m, 2, 10) \u2265 m\n2 + 2 + 3\u230a(m \u2212 3)/2\u230b.\nWhile finding a lower bound for n(m, 2, 9) we see that the following are the forbidden\nconfigurations (Refer to Figure 7). We find that the graphs which do not have subgraphs\n\nFigure 7: Forbidden configuration : graphs on four vertices which contain three edges.\nas any of the configurations. Such graphs will consist of disjoint\npaths of length two. The\n\u0001\nnumber of edges on m vertices is 2\u230am/3\u230b. So n(m, 2, 9) \u2265 m\n+\n2\u230am/3\u230b.\n2\n\n5\n\nConclusion and open problems\n\nIn this paper we answer some of the questions put forward by Paterson, Stinson and Wei\nin [2].
