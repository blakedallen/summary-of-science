We study the interplay between the order parameters to clarify\nhow superconductivity is affected by the presence of ferromagnetism and spin-orbit coupling. One of our key\nfindings is that the spin-orbit coupling seems to enhance both ferromagnetism and superconductivity in all spin\nchannels. We discuss our results in the context of the heavy fermion superconductor UIr and analyze possible\nsymmetries of the order parameter by the group theory method.\nPACS numbers: 74.20.Rp, 74.50.+r, 74.20.-z\n\nIn the past decade, a number of superconductors have been\ndiscovered that are called 'unconventional' as they fall outside\nthe Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) paradigm of electronphonon mediated pairing with an isotropic gap. Of those,\nUPt3 1 and Sr2 RuO4 2 were the first compounds to have been\nconfirmed as triplet p-wave superconductors. More recently, a\nferromagnetic (FM) superconductor was discovered in UGe2\nunder pressure3 , where the presence of an internal FM moment strongly suggests that only the equal-spin triplet pairing survives. In this latter example both the time-reversal and\nthe gauge symmetry due to SC order are spontaneously broken, which made UGe2 , as well as its cousins URhGe4 and\nUCoGe5 an exciting avenue for theoretical and experimental\nresearch.\nFor spin-triplet pairing, Anderson noticed6 that inversion\nsymmetry is required to obtain a pair of degenerate states\nc\u2020k |0i and c\u2020\u2212k |0i capable of forming a Cooper pair. It was\ntherefore surprising that superconductivity was discovered in\nthe heavy fermion compound CePt3 Si which lacks inversion\nsymmetry7. It soon became clear however that in the case of a\nnon-centrosymmetric crystal, the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nmixes different spin states, so that the division into triplet\nand singlet symmetry of the SC order parameter becomes\nmeaningless. A bulk of theoretical work exists that has provided a symmetry-based phenomenology to explain this in details8,9,10,11,12 . The symmetry of the superconducting (SC) gap\nin this and other unconventional superconductors is presently\na matter of intense investigation13,14,15,16 .\nAn intriguing question is what happens if time-reversal\nsymmetry is broken in a crystal that lacks a centre of inversion. Can such a material become a superconductor? This\nquestion was answered affirmatively when superconductivity was discovered in the non-centrosymmetic ferromagnetic\ncompound UIr under pressure17 . The symmetry of the SC order parameter and its connection to FM nevertheless remains\nunclear, which motivates the present study. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in condensed matter systems is conceptually\nof immense importance, as it may provide clues for what\ncould be expected in systems belonging to vastly different areas of physics. The study of a condensed-matter system such\n\nas UIr with multiple broken symmetries is likely to have impact on a number of disciplines of physics, including such\ndisparate phenomena as mass differences between elementary\nparticles and extremely dilute ultra-cold atomic gases.\nIn this work, we study a model system of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with substantial spin-orbit\ncoupling, which at the same time exhibits itinerant ferromagnetism. The origin of the SOC may be either that the crystal\nstructure lacks a center of inversion, such as in UIr, or due to a\nthin-film geometry where the breakdown of inversion symmetry near the surface induces transverse electrical fields, leading\nto the well-known Rashba SOC18 . Our model should therefore\nbe relevant both to the non-centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric heavy fermion compounds, since the SOC is considerable in any case due to the high atomic number. Specifically,\nmaterials that exhibit coexistence of SC and FM order and\nwhere SOC is large include UGe2 3 , URhGe4 , UCoGe5 , and\nUIr17 . For this model, we construct a mean-field theory, solve\nthe saddle point equations for the order parameters and study\nthe effect of spin-orbit coupling on the superconducting order\nparameters. Finally, we discuss application of this model to\nthe case of UIr.\nTo label the SOC+FM split bands, it is possible to introduce\na pseudospin basis in which the normal-state Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized. In the original spin basis, the SC matrix order\nparameter is characterized, in analogy to the p-wave state19 ,\n\u02c6 \u03b1\u03b2 (k) = \u0131\u2206s \u03c3\u0302y +\nby a vector dk and scalar \u2206s so that \u2206\n[\u0131(dk * \u03c3\u0302)\u03c3\u0302y ]\u03b1\u03b2 . Note that, unlike the usual p-wave SC, a\nsinglet component \u2206s of the gap will also be present since\nantisymmetric SOC in general mixes the parity of the order\nparameter. Below, . \u02c6. . is used for 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. We now\nproceed to write down the effective Hamiltonian H = HN +\nHSC for our system. In the normal state, the Hamiltonian in\nmomentum-space reads22\nX \u2020\nHN = H0 +\n[ck\u03b1 (\u03b5k 1\u0302 \u2212 h\u03c3\u0302z + \u03c3\u0302 * gk )\u03b1\u03b2 ck\u03b2 ], (1)\nk\u03b1\u03b2\n\nwhere H0 = IN M 2 /2. Above, the dispersion relation \u03b5k is\nmeasured from chemical potential \u03bc, and the magnetization\nM = |M| is taken along the easy-axis, while h = IM is\n\n\f2\n\nHSC =\n\n1 X\nVkk\u2032 \u03c3 c\u0303\u2020k\u03c3 c\u0303\u2020\u2212k\u03c3 c\u0303\u2212k\u2032 \u03c3 c\u0303k\u2032 \u03c3 ,\n2N \u2032\n\n(2)\n\nkk \u03c3\n\nand perform a standard mean-field decoupling, which after\nan additional diagonalization yields the total Hamiltonian in\nthe superconducting state: H = H0 + \u03a3k\u03c3 (\u1ebck\u03c3 \u2212 Ek\u03c3 \u2212\n \u0303 k\u03c3 |2 )1/2\n \u0303 k\u03c3 b\u0303\u2020 + 2\u03b7 \u2020 \u03b7k\u03c3 )/2, where Ek\u03c3 = (\u1ebc 2 + |\u2206\n\u2206\nk\u03c3\nk\u03c3\nk\u03c3\n\u2020\nand {\u03b7k\u03c3 , \u03b7k\u03c3 } are new fermion operators. The merit of this\nprocedure is that we can now obtain simple self-consistency\n \u0303 k\u03c3 , which may then be transformed\nequations for the gaps \u2206\nback to the gaps in the original spin-basis \u03c6k by means of\nthe unitary transformation Pk . We assume a chiral p-wave\nsymmetry for the gaps with a corresponding pairing potential\n\u2032\nVkk\u2032 \u03c3 = \u2212gsc e\u0131\u03c3(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6 ) , where tan \u03c6 = kx /ky . The motivation for this is that this choice ensures that the condition\ndk k gk is satisfied exactly for h \u2192 0, and corresponds to\na fully gapped Fermi surface which favors the condensation\n \u0303 k\u03c3 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2206\n \u0303 \u03c3,0 e\u0131\u03c3\u03c6 and\nenergy. The gaps obtain the form \u2206\nwe find a self-consistency equation of the standard BCS form\nwith a cutoff \u03c9 on the pairing-fluctuation spectrum which we\ndo not specify further. Moreover, N \u03c3 (\u03b5) is the pseudospinresolved density of states (DOS) for the \u1ebck\u03c3 (\u03c3=\u00b1) bands\nof the quasiparticle excitations24 .

In such a scenario, the SC order parameter couples to\nthe spontaneous magnetization M through a term \u03b3M * dk \u00d7\nd\u2217k in the free energy, where the sign of \u03b3 is determined by the\ngradient of the DOS at Fermi level21 and hSk i = \u0131dk \u00d7 d\u2217k\nis the spin associated with the Cooper pair. Thus, for \u03b3 < 0\nit is expected that a SC pairing state obeying \u0131dk \u00d7 d\u2217k k M\nis energetically favored, implying that dk must be complexvalued. Our model captures broken time-reversal symmetry in\naddition to antisymmetric SOC. As shown by Anderson6, the\npresence of the latter is detrimental to spin-triplet SC pairing\nstate, unless dk k gk . In our case, it is obvious that a nonunitary SC pairing state cannot satisfy this condition since dk\nis complex, whereas gk must be real for the Hamiltonian to\nbe hermitian.\nThe SOC vector reads gk = \u2212g\u2212k , and we introduce\ngk = gk,x \u2212 \u0131gk,y for later use. We consider the SOC in\nthe Rashba form, namely gk = \u03bb(ky , \u2212kx , 0). This corresponds to a situation where an asymmetric potential gradient\nis present along the z-axis, and is also the scenario realized in\nnon-centrosymmetric CePt3 Si11 . We have introduced fermion\noperators {ck\u03c3 } in a basis \u03c6k = [ck\u2191 , ck\u2193 ]T .\nDiagonalizing the normal-state Hamiltonian\nyields the\n\u221a\nquasiparticle excitations \u1ebck\u03c3 = \u03b5k \u2212 \u03c3 h2 + \u03bb2 k 2 , which\ndue to the SOC are characterized by the pseudospin \u03c3 =\n\u00b11.\nFor later use, we define Nk = [1 + \u03bb2 k 2 /(h +\n\u221a\nh2 + \u03bb2 k 2 )2 ]\u22121/2 . The superconducting pairing is now assumed to occur between the excitations described by \u03c6\u0303k . Due\nto the presence of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, this automatically leads to a mixed-parity SC state in the original\nspin basis.

(3, 4) are the main analytical results of this work.\nLet us briefly investigate some important limiting cases of\nEq. (3). In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (\u03bb \u2192 0), one\n \u0303 k\u03c3 while \u2206k\u2191\u2193 = 0, such that\nfinds Nk\u03c3 \u2192 1 and \u2206k\u03c3 = \u2206\nwe reproduce the results of Refs.22,23 . In the absence\n\u221a of an\nexchange energy (h \u2192 0), one finds that Nk\u03c3 \u2192 1/ 2 and\n \u0303 \u2191,0 + \u2206\n \u0303 \u2193,0 )/2, \u2206k\u2193 = e\u2212\u0131\u03c6 (\u2206\n \u0303 \u2191,0 + \u2206\n \u0303 \u2193,0 )/2,\n\u2206k\u2191 = \u2212e\u0131\u03c6 (\u2206\n \u0303 \u2193,0 \u2212 \u2206\n \u0303 \u2191,0 )/2. As demanded by consisand \u2206k\u2191\u2193 = (\u2206\ntency, the triplet gaps are equal in magnitude since there is\nno exchange field and the singlet component is nonzero since\n \u0303 \u2191,0 6= \u2206\n \u0303 \u2193,0 in general. Finally, Eq. (4) reproduces the well\u2206\nknown Stoner criterion I \u0303 \u2265 1 for the onset of FM in the absence of SOC and SC (\u03bb \u2192 0, g \u2192 0).\nWe now focus on the general case in which h 6= 0 and\n\u03bb 6= 0. First of all, we must specify the range of the pa-\n\n\f3\nrameters in the problem that corresponds to a physically realistic scenario. We allow h to range, in principle, from 0\nto \u03bc, the latter denoting a fully polarized ferromagnet. As\na convenient measure of the strengthpof SOC, we introduce\nthe dimensionless quantity \u03b1soc \u2261\n2\u03bb2 m/\u03bc which has a\ndirect physical interpretation: namely, it is the ratio of the\nSOC (at EF ) to the Fermi energy \u03bc. The parameter \u03b1soc is\nallowed to vary from 0 to \u03b4, where \u03b4 denotes a fraction of\nthe Fermi energy. We take \u03b4 = 0.5 as a sensible upper limit.\nNote that generically, the SOC strength at the Fermi level is\ndifferent for the two quasiparticle bands, and moreover depends on h. For\npa given value of h, one may derive that\n\u03bb \u2264 \u03b4\u03bc/[2\u03bcm+ 2m2 (h2 + \u03b4 2 \u03bc2 )]1/2 ensures that the spinorbit energy is less than \u03b4 \u00d7 \u03bc for both quasiparticle bands.\nIn Fig. 1a-d, we present the self-consistent solutions for\nthe order parameters in Eqs. (3) and (4) as a function of the\nFM exchange parameter I \u0303 for several values of \u03b1soc . We have\ndefined \u2206\u03c3 = |\u2206k\u03c3 | and \u2206\u2191\u2193 = |\u2206k\u2191\u2193 |, and fixed \u03c9/\u03bc =\n0.01 and m/\u03bc = 5 \u00d7 104 with c = 0.2, which are standard\nchoices. For \u03b1soc = 0, the onset of FM occurs at I \u0303 = 1.0\nwhich lifts the degeneracy of \u2206\u2191 and \u2206\u2193 , while \u2206\u2191\u2193 is always\nzero. Upon increasing \u03b1soc , it is interesting to note that the\n \u0303 indicating that\nPM-FM transition occurs at lower values of I,\nspin-orbit coupling favors ferromagnetic ordering. For \u03b1soc 6=\n0, it is seen that \u2206\u2191\u2193 is also non-zero, although it becomes\nsuppressed at the onset of ferromagnetism. A common feature\nfor all gaps is that they increase with \u03b1soc in the absence of\nferromagnetism and deep inside the ferromagnetic phase I \u0303 \u2265\n1.02. In the intermediate regime, there are crossovers between\nthe gaps for different values of \u03b1soc due to the different onsets\nof ferromagnetic order. By comparing the behaviour between\nthe gaps for increasing I \u0303 with \u03b1soc 6= 0, one infers that \u2206\u2193 and\n\u2206\u2191\u2193 eventually saturate at a constant non-zero value, while\n\u2206\u2191 continues to increase steadily. This is quite different from\nthe case when \u03b1soc = 0, where the minority spin-gap goes\n \u0303 This seems to suggest that\nto zero rapidly with increasing I.\nthe presence of spin-orbit coupling in the system ensures the\nsurvival of the minority-spin gap \u2206\u2193 and the singlet gap \u2206\u2191\u2193\neven though the FM exchange energy becomes strong.\nIn Fig. 1e and 1f, we plot the ratio of the singlet and triplet\ngaps, defined as R\u2206 = \u2206\u2191\u2193 /(\u2206\u2191 + \u2206\u2193 ), and the maximal\ncritical temperature Tc,max for the onset of superconductivity. It is seen from the left panel that R\u2206 increases with \u03b1soc\nin the PM regime, suggesting that the singlet component becomes more prominent in the system as compared to the triplet\ngaps. However, at the onset of FM order, R\u2206 decreases since\nthe singlet component becomes suppressed by the Zeemansplitting. In the right panel, one observes that Tc,max in \u0303 Our findings suggest that the\ncreases both with \u03b1soc and I.\npresence of antisymmetric SOC, originating from e.g. noncentrosymmetricity of the crystal structure, enhances both the\ntendency towards ferromagnetism and the magnitude of the\nSC gaps in all spin channels. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, it was shown in Ref.22 that the simultaneous coexistence\nof FM and non-unitary triplet superconductivity is the thermodynamically favored state as compared to the pure normal,\nFM, or SC state. Since the presence of spin-orbit coupling is\nseen to enhance both the FM and SC order parameters, it is\n\nreasonable to expect that the coexistent state is still thermodynamically the most favorable one even when \u03b1soc 6= 0.\nOut of the known non-centrosymmetric superconductors,\nUIr is the only compound that is also a ferromagnet. This material, which is ferromagnetic at ambient pressure, develops\nsuperconductivity in a narrow pressure region around P \u223c\n2.6 GPa right next to the FM\u2013PM quantum phase transition,\nwith a maximum SC transition temperature TSC \u223c 0.14 K17 .\nAt this pressure, the saturated magnetic moment was measured to be 0.07\u03bcB per U atom, and such a small value clearly\nindicates the itinerant character of the ferromagnetism, presumably due to 5f electrons of uranium. UIr crystallizes in\nthe monoclinic structure (space group P 21 ) which lacks inversion symmetry, and the FM moment is Ising-like, oriented\nalong the [101\u0304] direction in the (ac)-plane.\nGiven the proximity of the SC state in UIr to the PM transition, one may probably consider the magnetization h as a\nperturbation on top of the SOC-split bands. Neglecting the\neffect of the former, it is known12 that even in the case of\nnon-centrosymmetric superconductors (and h = 0), the band\nenergies still satisfy the relation \u03b5\u03b2 (k) = \u03b5\u03b2 (\u2212k) due to the\ntime reversal symmetry of the single-electron Hamiltonian.\nAs a consequence, the SC order parameter on the \u03b2-th sheet\nof the Fermi surface transforms according to one of the irreducible representations of the normal state point group. In the\ncase of UIr, the point group C2 has two one-dimensional irreducible representations, denoted A and B. Then the SC order\nparameter is an odd function \u2206(\u2212k) = \u2212\u2206(k) given by27\n\u2206A,B\n(k) \u221d t(k) \u03c6A,B\n(k), where t(k) is an odd phase fac\u03b2\n\u03b2\ntor28 and the basis functions \u03c6A,B are even in k. Denoting the\nrotation axis of the C2 group as z (this actually corresponds to\nb-axis in case of UIr), the even functions \u03c6A and \u03c6B can then\nbe cast in the following form: \u03c6A (k) = (kz2 + C) u1 (k), and\n\u03c6B (k) = kz (kx u2 (k) + ky u3 (k)), where C is some constant and {ui (k)} are arbitrary even functions of kx , ky , kz .\nFunction \u03c6A generically has no nodes, whereas \u03c6B has two\npoint nodes at the poles (kx =ky =0) and a line of nodes at the\nequator. The symmetry argument does not allow one to determine which pairing channel is realized, however the experimental observation of the strong pair-breaking effect due to\ndisorder17 indicates that the gap must be anisotropic, possibly\nfavouring the gap with the nodes such as \u2206B (k).\nOne way of experimentally probing the symmetry of the\nsuperconducting order parameter in UIr would be by means\nof transport properties such as Josephson tunneling or pointcontact spectroscopy. In particular, it has recently been shown\nthat the presence of multiple gaps in superconductors with\nbroken inversion symmetry should manifest itself through\nclear signatures at bias voltages corresponding to the sum and\ndifference of the singlet and triplet components22,25,26 . We expect similar behavior in the present case, at least when the\nferromagnetism is weak, and point-contact spectroscopy data\ncould then be compared with the predictions for R\u2206 in Fig.\n1e. Alternatively, it should be possible to directly probe the\nspin-texture of the superconducting order parameter by studying the effect of an externally applied magnetic field when the\nparamagnetic limitation dominates, e.g. in a thin-film structure, where the orbital mechanism of destroying superconduc-\n\n\f4\ntivity is suppressed29 .\nIn summary, we have developed a mean-field model for\na superconductor lacking inversion symmetry and displaying\nitinerant ferromagnetism. Specifically, we have investigated\nthe interplay between ferromagnetism and asymmetric spinorbit coupling and how these affect superconducting order,\nwhich in general is a mixture of a singlet and triplet components. Our main results are the analytical expression Eqs. (3)\nand (4) and the belonging discussion. We find that spin-orbit\ncoupling may enhance superconductivity in both the singlet\nand triplet channels in addition to favoring the Stoner crite-\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nR.
