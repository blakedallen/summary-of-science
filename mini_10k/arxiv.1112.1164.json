This allows for example for more efficient use of infrared light, however, the current achievable\nupconversion efficiencies limits its applications.\nFor application of photon upconversion it is desirable\nthat this process takes place even in the lower power density excitation regime (< 1 W/cm2 ). Such upconversion\nshould not occur through simultaneous absorption of two\nphotons ((Fig. 1) a)), but rather through interaction of\nan incident photon and an excited particle (Fig. 1 b))\nor energy transfer between two excited particles (Fig. 1\nc)). Such a phenomenon is reported in semiconductor\nheterojunctions and bulk systems.1\u201310 Upconverted photoluminescence (UPL) from materials systems with InAs\nquantum dots (QDs) has already been reported.11,12 Recently, we showed that upconversion is observed even for\nInAs thickness below QD formation and suggested the\npossibility of upconversion occurring through confined\nstates in extended InAs islands.13 Because such quantum structures are like quantum wells (QWs) with defined borders in the in-plane directions, we term these\nisland structures QW islands (QWIs). The observed PL\nexcitation (PLE) spectra and power dependence suggest\nthat in QWIs energy transfer between the excited particles (Fig. 1 c)) is most important. Therefore, two-step\ntwo-photon-absorption (TS-TPA) processes without photon recycling (Fig. 1 b)) will be not considered hereafter.\nAt least two factors are involved in determining the upconversion efficiency. Firstly, the intrinsic lifetime of the\nintermediate state. Because interaction between two particles is needed, a longer lifetime increases the probability for energy transfer. To distinguish this time constant\nfrom the one discussed later we will call this lifetime a\ntemporal cross section. Secondly, the spatial cross section for energy transfer between the excited particles. In\nthe case of local energy transfer (e.g. Auger processes1 ),\na large spatial overlap between the two excited particles\nwill increase the probability for energy transfer. For nonlocal processes (e.g. TS-TPA with photon recycling)2 the\n\nEgap\n\nb) TS-TPA without c) TS-TPA with recycling\nor Auger process\nrecycling\n\n{\n1 carrier\n& 2 photons\n\nIntermediate state\n1 carrier\n& 2 photons\n\nEnergy transfer\n2 carriers\n& 2 photons\n\nFIG. 1. (color online) Energy diagram for three types of upconversion in semiconductor systems. In all three cases two incident photons with energy about 75% of the bandgap energy\nEgap are absorbed and the final state consists of one carrier\nwith energy larger than Egap . Radiative recombination from\nthe conduction band minimum will result in an upconverted\nphoton, that is, one photon with energy larger than the incident photons used for excitation. a) Two-photon-absorption\n(TPA) process. Two photons are simultaneously absorbed\nby a single carrier. b) Two-step two-photon-absorption (TSTPA) without photon recycling. Successive absorption of\ntwo incident photons. The second photon must be absorbed\nwithin the time interval the carrier being in the intermediate\nstate. Else, recombination leads to a new photon (in case\nof radiative recombination) with energy of the intermediate\nstate. c) Energy transfer between two excited carriers. TSTPA process with photon recycling is defined as the process\nwhere a photon by radiative recombination of the carrier in\nthe left intermediate state is absorbed by the right excited\ncarrier, i.e., the dipole matrix element determines the interaction strength. In an Auger process the Coulomb potential\nbetween the carriers mediates the energy transfer.\n\ncross section for the second particle for absorbing the\nemitted photon from the first particle has to be large. It\nis of interest to determine how these two cross sections\ncontribute to upconversion in a specific system.\nWith this in mind, we would like to point out that\nhighly efficient upconversion phenomena through rare\nearth14,15 are generally believed to have their origin in\na long living intermediate state (high temporal cross section). In this work it is shown that high UPL efficiency\ncan be achieved even through intermediate states with\nrelatively short lifetimes.

In\nsample A the InAs layer is embedded in an AlGaAs barrier, leading to higher confined states of the InAs quantum\nstructures compared to a GaAs barrier (sample B). The three\nGaAs/AlGaAs QWs below the InAs layer are referred to as\nthe MQW, the single GaAs/AlGaAs on top is referred to as\nthe SQW.\n\nlows. Even with short-lifetime states, a highly efficient\nupconversion process can be observed if the spatial cross\nsection for energy transfer between the two excited carriers is sufficiently large. With regard to the InAs based\nquantum structures used in this study, we believe that an\nefficient Auger process between excitons in InAs QWIs is\nthe origin for UPL.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nIn this letter, optical data obtained from two samples whose structures are shown in Fig. 2 are compared.\nDetailed PL data for sample A as well as the model\nfor the upconversion process are described in our previous publication.13 The intermediate states investigated\nhere are formed in the InAs quantum structures which\nare sandwiched by an AlGaAs barrier (sample A) or\nby a GaAs barrier (sample B). Reference quantum wells\n(QWs) are also included in these samples.\nBoth samples were grown on semi-insulating GaAs\n(001) wafers by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Following a GaAs buffer and an Al0.22 Ga0.78 As layer growth,\nGaAs/AlGaAs multi QWs (MQWs) were grown at\n650 \u25e6 C. For sample A the growth was then interrupted\nand a two monolayer (ML) InAs layer was deposited at\n500 \u25e6 C and immediately capped by a GaAs/AlGaAs single QW (SQW) structure while gradually raising the substrate temperature to 650 \u25e6 C. For sample B two further\ngrowth interrupts were introduced; one before the InAs\ngrowth in order to grow the lower GaAs barrier at 600 \u25e6 C\nand another before the top SQW growth to grow the AlGaAs barrier at 650 \u25e6 C.\nPhotoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed at 4K.

The PL spectra from the GaAs\nregion show similar features for both samples. The Al\ncontent for sample B was slightly higher (due to a deviation in the growth conditions), therefore, the AlGaAs\nband to acceptor (e-A) peak and the SQW and MQW\npeaks are blue shifted by 5 nm.

This energy is smaller than the\nQW states (> 1.70 eV), but still larger than the GaAs\nbandgap (1.52 eV). Therefore, the PL observed from\nthe AlGaAs and QW regions are anti-Stokes PL or UPL,\nwhereas the PL from the GaAs is Stokes PL. The data\nobtained by cw excitation are shown in Fig. 4 with the\norange (sample A) and blue (sample B) curves. Again,\nthe PL spectra from GaAs for both samples are similar.\nThe main differences lie in the UPL. On the whole, the\nUPL from sample B is stronger than that from sample A.\n\nFIG. 6. (color online) PLE spectra for selected states. Excitation power density: 10 W/cm2 (cw). The intensities are\nnormalized by the integration time and power density. The\ndata shows a clear difference between samples A and B when\ncrossing the GaAs bandgap. From the difference in the total intensity an approximate value for the contribution of the\nGaAs bandgap UPL to the observed TRPL can be calculated.\nThe lines are guides to the eyes. The inset shows how a weak\nand strong resonance of the GaAs bandgap UPL would be\nobserved in the UPLE.\n\nFor instance, the SQW UPL from sample B is an order\nof magnitude larger than that from sample A. This increase in the QW UPL intensity pushes the relative UPL\nefficiency \u03b7rel (ratio of the SQW luminescence intensities for excitation with 1.54 eV, 10 W/cm2 and 2.33 eV,\n10W/cm2 ) up to about 0.2%. The power dependence of\nthe UPL is \u22481.23 for cw excitation (see Fig. 5). The gray\ndata points in Fig. 4 represent the spectrum observed by\nthe streak camera integrated over 12.5 ns. This spectrum is normalized to the GaAs exciton peak of sample\nA. Due to the higher power density we see broadening\nof all peaks accompanied with a relative increase in the\nUPL intensity, which is inevitable for the streak camera\nmeasurement.\nFollowing our previous report,13 we wish to assure\nthat the observed UPL is mainly due to the InAs layer,\nand not due to upconversion from the GaAs bandgap (in\nthe following referred to as GaAs bandgap UPL) which\nis also excited during the TRPL measurements. This\ncan be verified with the PLE spectra shown in Fig. 6,\nwhich compares both samples A and B for excitation\nabove and below the GaAs bandgap. The features in\nsample A have been discussed in detail in our previous\nwork.13 In brief, for sample A we observe a resonant peak\nat the GaAs band gap for all three states (this manifests\nin the plateau above the GaAs bandgap energy and a\nsmall peak at the bandgap, triangle U-S-C in Fig. 6),\nand a prominent decrease in the MQW when crossing\nthe band gap. This is due to the capture of upconverted\ncarriers from the GaAs buffer in the MQW states for\nexcitation energies above the GaAs bandgap. The top\n\n\f4\n\nB.\n\nTime resolved measurement\n\nThe time decay of the UPL from the top SQW of sample B is shown in Fig. 7. It is obvious that the time\nconstant for the state responsible for UPL is only on the\nnano-second (ns) order. To our best knowledge this is\nthe first direct observation of the time constant for upconversion through InAs intermediate states. This data\nproves that upconversion with efficiencies on the order of\n1% in a semiconductor system can be realized without\nlong lifetimes on the order of \u03bcs, which is usually considered necessary. We explain the observed efficient UPL\nwith short lifetime intermediate states by considering a\nhigh spatial cross section for the energy transfer between\ntwo excited particles.\nA simple interpretation of the data is given first. The\nrise time of the UPL signal is about 270 ps, mainly determined by the radiative recombination time constant of\nthe probe SQW and the exciton formation. After a maximum is reached, a two-component decay is observed.\nWe attribute the short lifetime component (high intensity regime) to the upconversion from the InAs intermediate state and the long lifetime component (low intensity\nregime) to the upconversion from the GaAs bandgap region.\nA set of rate equations is solved to determine the approximate time constants. It is assumed that a sub 20\n\n1000\nUPL Intensity (arb. units)\n\nSQW is less influenced, mainly receiving carriers from\nthe InAs intermediate state. For sample B, we observe\na prominent decrease for both the SQW and MQW, and\nonly a very weak resonance at the GaAs bandgap (no\nplateau visible, triangle U-W-C in Fig. 6). This is explained by considering the nature of the resonant absorption of the GaAs barrier surrounding the InAs QWI. For\nwavelengths shorter than 814 nm GaAs is excited mainly\nnon-resonantly, which results in part of the carriers relaxing to the InAs QWI. When the laser energy approaches\nthe GaAs bandgap energy, stronger resonant excitation\nof GaAs leads to less carriers relaxing to the InAs QWI.\nHence, UPL induced by the InAs layer must decrease during the resonant excitation of GaAs in sample B, which\nis the result observed. From the comparison between the\nPLE intensity increase due to the GaAs bandgap UPL\n(Fig. 6, intensity difference between points C-S and C-W\nfor strong and weak influence, respectively) and the total intensity increase for below and above bandgap excitation (intensity difference between points L-U) we infer\nthat for sample B the GaAs bandgap UPL contributes\nabout eight times less (ratio of UPL through InAs QWIs\nand UPL through GaAs bandgap \u03b1 \u2248 8) to the total\nUPL than the InAs QWI. This means that UPL through\nthe intermediate state in the InAs layer should be either\ndominant at the initial stage of TRPL decay in sample B\nor has a much slower decay than the GaAs bandgap UPL.\nThe latter case can be discarded due to the experimental\ndata shown below.\n\nB SQW transient\nLaser pulse\nFit\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\nTime (ns)\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 7.

The intensity reaches its maximum about 270 ps\nafter the laser pulse (green line). Then a clear two component\ndecay is observed. We attribute the fast decay to the InAs\nUPL and the slow decay to the GaAs bandgap UPL. The fit\nindicated incorporates a local process (major contribution)\nand a non-local process (minor contribution) as described in\nthe text.

There are two major contributions to UPL: the upconversion from the GaAs bandgap\nto the GaAs/AlGaAs SQW and the upconversion from\nthe InAs quantum structure to GaAs/AlGaAs SQW. The\neffective decay constants for these two processes are each\ncomposed of two sub decay constants, that is,\n\u03c4e\u22121 = \u03c4i\u22121 + \u03c4p (n)\u22121 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe effective decay constant \u03c4e for the intermediate state\nfor upconversion has two \"decay\" channels: an intrinsic\nlifetime \u03c4i (independent of the carrier density n), and\nan upconverion time constant \u03c4p that depends on the\ncarrier density n. The effective time constants obtained\nfrom TRPL for InAs UPL and GaAs bandgap UPL are\n\u03c4InAsUP L \u2248 265 ps and \u03c4GaAsUP L \u2248 1300 ps, respectively. The effective time constant for the initial increase\nis \u03c4initial \u2248 180 ps. This value is a series sum of exciton\nformation and SQW decay. The values indicate that the\ntime constant for the GaAs/AlGaAs SQW being within\nthe values reported for similar systems17,18 for an exciton\nrelaxation time constant \u2248 100 ps.\nFor the discussion and detailed fit of the upconversion\n\n\f5\ntime constants, it must be considered that these are effective values as described above. If one of the two sub time\nconstants is much larger than the other one, the effective\ntime constant is practically identical to the shorter sub\ntime constant. This may be the case for the GaAs UPL.\nThe effective time constant can be well explained with\nthe intrinsic lifetime of carriers in the GaAs intermediate\nstate for upconversion (\u2248 1350 ps).19 If this is the case,\nthen the time constant for upconversion has to be one\nto two orders of magnitude larger, which we believe is\nplausible for an excitonic Auger process in bulk GaAs.\nThe focus of the following discussion lies on the InAs\nUPL. The effective time constant for the InAs UPL provides an important clue for elucidating the upconversion\nmechanisms. Time constants of Stokes PL of QDs are\nusually several times larger than 265 ps, the effective time\nconstant obtained for the InAs intermediate state.20,21 If\nwe assume that the effective time constant of the confined\nstate in flat QDs (aspect ratio larger than \u224810) solely depends on the QD height,22 then, considering calculations\nof the oscillator strength of a narrow QW,23 it can be\nestimated that the thickness of the QW responsible for\nthe observed InAs UPL is several times thinner than the\nusual QD height. This leads to the model that several\nmonolayer thick InAs QWIs are reasonable origins for the\nInAs intermediate states.\nThis proposed model is supported by the following observations. InAs deposition leads to random formation\nof several-monolayer-thick islands before transition into\nQDs. Due to the stochastic growth process, islands can\nalso exist for InAs deposition above the critical thickness for QD formation. Extended islands form thin InAs\nQWIs in the barrier, where at least two excitons can\noccupy the lowest energy state within the same island.\nBased on the temperature dependence and PLE of the\nUPL, which are similar to our earlier report,13 we believe that a highly efficient energy transfer between these\nnearly degenerated excitons confined in these thin (about\n2 to 3ML) InAs QWIs is taking place.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe upconversion mechanism can be classified into two\ndifferent processes: local and non-local (Fig. 8). We assume that for both processes the ensemble upconversion\nrate is proportional to the average carrier density in a\nsingle island (this should be well fulfilled for low power\ndensity regime). In the non-local process, an exciton will\ninteract with another exciton seperated up to a certain\ndistance. For higher densities the number of partner excitons which can be found within the interaction distance\nis larger, therefore the recombination time decreases with\nincreasing average carrier density. In the local process,\nan exciton can only interact with another exciton in the\nsame island. It is assumed that for the excitation power\ndensities applied, the majority of QWIs is occupied only\nwith one or two excitons. Therefore, the local upconver-\n\nNon-local Local\nHigh\ndensity\n(pulse)\nLow\ndensity\n(cw)\n\nFIG. 8. (color online) Schematic description of possible upconversion processes in the InAs quantum structure in top\nview (growth direction is out of plane). The circles and the\nred dots represent InAs QWIs and excitons, respectively. The\nlines show possible exciton-exciton interaction of the center\nexciton due to a non-local process (orange) or a local process\n(blue). In the cw case, the probability for two excitons being in the same island during the same time interval is much\nsmaller than for the pulse excitation (both excitations have\nthe same averaged power density), hence the probability of\na second exciton being in any nearby island at any time is\ndistinctively higher. Therefore, the non-local process must\nbe the majority at very low excitation densities. However, if\nQWIs are reasonably large, the local process can be the major\nprocess down to solar excitation power densities due to higher\nbi-exciton formation probability (Fig. 12).\n\nsion rate is expressed with a constant recombination time\n(equations shown below).\nIn the following we explain why we discard the nonlocal process from the major mechanisms in pulse excitation, and also why the contribution of both local and\nnon-local processes may become comparable in cw excitation.\nThe definition of the upconversion efficiency is crucial\nfor understanding the following discussion in detail. The\nrelative intensity ratio defined earlier (ratio of the observed SQW UPL intensity for excitation at 10W/cm2\nand the observed Stokes PL intensity of the SQW at\n10W/cm2 ) is\n\u03b7rel = 0.2\u00b10.02% .\n\n(2)\n\nWith the given excitation densities the investigated\nstructure should be\n\u03b7ideal \u2248 2.4\u00b10.8%\n\n(3)\n\nin the cw case (Fig. 9). For this estimation it is assumed\nthat the island geometry is similar to that observed from\nsamples with 1.5ML InAs (rQW I \u2248 40 nm, area coverage \u2248 5%), and the absorption coefficient (for 3ML thick\nQWIs) is bulk-like.

Recombination at the SQW state\nleads to upconverted photons (for the SQW we consider radiative recombination only).\n\npair will result in an upconverted photon. However, in\nreality only a fraction of the excitons in the QWI contribute to upconversion. This is the internal efficiency\nfor the upconversion mechanism,\n\u03b7internal \u2248 \u03b7rel /\u03b7ideal = 8.3\u00b13.6% .\n\n(4)\n\nThis value means that out of 100 excitons in the QWIs,\nabout 8 take part in the upconversion process, leading to\n4 upconverted photons in total, that is, the internal quantum efficiency for upconversion in the QWIs observed is\n\u03b7 = 4.2\u00b11.8%. This efficiency may be compared with\nthe internal quantum efficiencies of other mechanisms.\nThe uncertainty of this value is mainly determined by\nthe difference between the real absorption coefficient and\nthat of bulk material, and the probability with which the\nSQW captures the upconverted carriers. The calculation\nin the following is performed for \u03b7 close to the estimated\nvalues: 2.3%, 4.7%, 7%, and 10%. It is found that only\nvalues larger than 4.7% result in good fits as shown later.\nThe model of the relaxation processes used is shown in\nFig. 10. From the left to the right it shows the excitation\nvia the laser followed by the relaxation of the excitons to\nthe GaAs and InAs intermediate states (for simplicity we\nassume the same rate for both).

At the InAs and GaAs\nintermediate states the excited carriers can either be upconverted via a local or a non-local process, or decay radiatively\nor non-radiatively without transferring their energy to other\nexcited carriers. The corresponding time constants are shown\nnext to the arrows.\n\nby the excitation, \u03c4relax the time constant for relaxing to\nthe ground state, and \u03c4i is the time constant for exciton\nrecombination without energy transfer to another exciton. The time constants for local and non-local energy\ntransfer between excitons are noted with \u03c4loc and \u03c4non ,\nrespectively. The terms on the right side of Eq. 5 express in order, the rate of the excitons which relax to\nthe island, the decay of carriers due to the intrinsic lifetime, the upconversion through a local process and that\nthrough a non-local process, respectively. The equation\nprovides the definition of the time constants used, which\nis needed to compare the fitted values with theoretical\ncalculations.\nIt is important to note that for the non-local process\nthe time constant must depend on the density, as explained above.

Best fits, close to the experimentally obtained parameters \u03b1 \u2248 8 and r \u224820 to 40 nm\nare found for \u03b7 \u2248 7%. For \u03b7 \u2248 2.3% all residuals are too\nlarge, for \u03b7 \u2248 4.7% only residuals for large \u03b1 are acceptable\nand for \u03b7 \u2248 10% the residuals are small, but \u03b1 is not close\nenough to the estimated value.

(color online) Interactions between two excitons (red\ndots) in small an large QWIs (circles and ellipses, respectively) for low excitation power densities. In systems with\nsmall QWIs the distant excitons can only interact via nonlocal dipole interaction. For extended QWIs the probability\nfor two excitons in the same QWI is higher. Therefore, local processes can be major under small excitation densities.\nThe exciton radius and exciton diffusion determine if the local\nprocess is a dipole or an Auger process.\n\nrole in the cw regime. The average fitting values for the\npoints in the 7% region in Fig. 11 is x = 0.048 \u00b1 0.036,\n\u03b1 = 5.76 \u00b1 0.45, \u03c4i = 383\u00b122 ps, \u03c4loc = 4.9\u00b10.3 ns and\n\u03c4non \u2248 203.7 \u00b1 129.0 ns. Lower efficiencies (4.7%) result in roughly values doubled for x, \u03b1, and \u03c4loc . This\nsuggests that any reasonable time constant for the local\nprocess is smaller than 10 ns, several times smaller than\nthe non-local time constant.\nThe estimated range of x predicts a power dependence\nclose to linear for cw excitation with 10 W/cm2 , as is\nobserved in the experiment. Such a system (i.e., a system with dynamic relation between local and non-local\nprocesses) will gradually change its power dependence\nfrom quadratic (low power density) to linear (high power\ndensity) also observed by other groups.12 Samples with\nlarge island densities should then have a quadratic power\ndependence up to high excitation densities, whereas samples with low island densities show linear dependence\neven for lower excitation densities (Fig. 12) (we find the\ncrossover between squared and linear power dependence\nat about 1 W/cm2 ). From the experimental point of view\nthis model seems to account for all observed upconversion\ncharacteristics. We suggest two elementary mechanisms\nfor the local and non-local processes. Excitonic Auger\nprocesses are purely local, recombination of an exciton\nwill transfer its energy to the second exciton under momentum conservation. This exciton will then break up\ninto an upconverted electron and hole. The linear power\ndependence of the Auger process is only strictly correct\nas long as the number of bi-excitons in QWIs is proportional to the excitation power density, and three or more\nexcitons do not occupy the lowest energy state in the\nQWI. The observed power dependence 1.23 may also be\ninterpreted such that tri-exciton formation takes place to\nsome extent.\nThe non-local process can be explained with a TSTPA process with photon recycling, i.e. , two excitons\ninteract resonantly via electromagnetic dipole field. This\nprocess also inherits the ability for local upconversion,\n\n\f8\nhowever, if the time constant for an excitonic Auger process is much shorter, local upconversion essentially occurs through Auger and the non-local part is described\nby the TS-TPA process with photon recycling. To verify\nthe correctness of this assignment a theoretical study on\nthe upconversion time constant is needed. This requires\nthe matrix elements to be determined without a large\nerror due to the uncertainty of the material parameters.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo conclude, we found that the time constant responsible for efficient UPL (experiment: \u03b7rel \u22480.2% for a\nstate at \u2248 1.77 eV = 700 nm with an excitation energy of 1.54 eV = 805 nm, that is, 0.2 eV energy gain\nwith a power density of 10 W/cm2 ) in InAs quantum\nstructures is on the order of 265 ps (this is the effective time constant). This is relatively short compared to\nthe usually expected lifetimes for efficient UPL materials systems. We estimate that this system can achieve\n4.2\u00b11.8% internal quantum efficiency for upconversion,\nwhich is a promising value considering the small excitation power density. The order of the estimated efficiency\nis confirmed with the fit of the UPL transient (\u2248 7%),\nsuggesting an intrinsic lifetime of \u2248 380 ps and an upconversion time constant of \u2248 4.9 ns.\nWe point out the importance of considering high spatial cross section processes for energy transfer for UPL.\nFor InAs quantum structures such as those we have\ngrown, the spatial cross section is relatively large compared to the temporal cross section. We define the onset\nof relative strong spatial cross section for \u03c4loc < 30\u03c4i .\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nW. Seidel, A. Titkov, J. P. Andr\u00e9, P.

The statement\nof strong spatial cross section holds true for any upconversion model conjectured for this system, because despite the relatively good UPL efficiency the UPL decay\ntime constant is below 1 ns. We explain this with the\nhigh spatial overlap of the excitons in the QWIs, and\nlow impurity concentration in the crystal. A numerical\ninvestigation of the data leads to the conclusion that nonlocal processes (for example TS-TPA with photon recycling) are minor in this materials system for excitation\nwith 10 W/cm2 . Local processes (for example excitonic\nAuger) can be used to explain both the cw and pulse data\ncorrectly, yet a non-local process may play a supporting\nrole in a cw regime where bi-exciton formation becomes\nless frequent.\nThe total efficiency is proportional to the product of\nthe spatial and temporal cross sections. Naturally, one\nneeds to maximize this product to achieve UPL at high\nefficiency. However, not all materials systems allow significant increase in the temporal cross section (lifetime).\nHence, the key factor to be investigated is the spatial\ncross section when developing upconversion devices with\nsemiconductor materials. Intelligent structures could\nlead to much better spatial cross sections, allowing UPL\nefficiencies to reach a level useful for applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Strategic Research Infrastructure Project, the Ministry of Education, Culture,\nSports, Science and Technology, Japan.\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n15841 (2000).\nC.
