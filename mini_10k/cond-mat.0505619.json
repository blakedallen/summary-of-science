Summary\nRecently reported structural complexity and superconducting transition in lithium under\npressure has increased the interest in light alkalis, otherwise considered as simple and well\nknown systems under normal conditions. In this work we present an analysis of the pressure\ninduced Fermi surface deformation in lithium with increasing pressure. According to our\ncalculations, under pressure the Fermi surface becomes highly anisotropic and around 30\nGPa develops an extended nesting, which could be the origin of the complex phase\ntransitions observed at this pressure via a phonon instability. On the other hand, the phonon\nsoftening induced by the observed distortion and nesting in the Fermi surface could also\nimply an increasing electron-phonon interaction with pressure, which might also allow a\nbetter understanding of the observed superconducting transition in lithium at around the\nsame pressure range.\nI. Introduction\nLight alkali metals have usually been considered simple metals due to their monovalency,\nhigh conductivity and crystallization in high symmetric structures. Under normal conditions\nthe interaction between valence electrons and ionic cores is weak in these elements and the\nsimple nearly free electron (NFE) model has been considered a good approximation to\nanalyze their properties (Wigner and Seitz 1933), which can be easily checked by their\nalmost spherical Fermi surfaces. However, recent both theoretical and experimental results\nhave radically changed our picture of the alkalis as simple systems, as phase transitions to\nlow coordinated structures induced by electronic localization have been reported (Neaton\nand Ashcroft 1999, Hanfland et al. 2000, Christensen and Novikov 2001, Bergara et al.\n2001). More surprisingly, recent experiments have shown that lithium even superconducts at\naround 20 K when the applied pressure rises to 30 GPa (Shimizu et al. 2002, Struzhkin et al.\n2002, Deemyad and Schilling 2004), becoming the highest transition temperature between\nsimple elements (Ashcroft 2002). It is noteworthy that experiments looking for\nsuperconductivity in lithium under ambient pressure have failed (Juntunen and Tuoriniemi\n2004), which even rises the interest to characterize physical properties of compressed light\nelements.\nIn what follows, we present an ab initio analysis of the pressure induced deformation of the\nFermi surface in lithium. According to our calculations, the Fermi surface develops a nesting\nunder pressure, which could be the origin of the interesting and unexpected new properties\narising in compressed lithium. Section III describes the theoretical and computational method\n\n\fJoint 20th AIRAPT \u2013 43th EHPRG, June 27 \u2013 July 1, Karlsruhe/Germany 2005\n\nthat we have used in this study. In Sec. IV we present our results and, finally, conclusions\nare presented in Sec. V.\nIII. Theoretical and Computational Method.\nIn order to analyze the electronic properties of lithium under pressure we have used a planewave implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) (Hohenberg and Kohn 1964, Kohn\nand Sham 1965) within the Local Density Approximation (LDA) (Perdew and Wang 1992), as\nimplemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) (Kresse and Hafner 1993,\nKresse and Furthmuller 1996). When dealing with high pressures an important core overlap\nis observed and requires methods that actually take into account the core electrons, instead\nof just adding them to the ionic cores. Therefore, we have considered the Projector\nAugmented Wave (PAW) approximation (Blochl 1994), which fully treats all the electrons. In\norder to obtain an accurate description of the whole Fermi surface, a dense Monkhorst-Pack\nmesh of 40 x 40 x 40 has been considered and three dimensional graphics have been\ngenerated by XCrySDen (Kokalj 1999). On the other hand, for each cross section of the\nFermi surface we have used a different set of around 3000 k-points in the corresponding\nplane inside the Brillouin zone, with a denser mesh in the proximities of the Fermi line. The\ndescription of the ML is implemented by a supercell which, in order to minimice interactions\nbetween them, contains ten layers of vacuum between MLs. The energy cutoff for all the\ncalculations carried out is 1090 eV.\n\n1.a\n(rs=3.02)\n\n1.b\n(rs=2.5)\n\n1.c\n(rs=2.15)\n\n1.d\n(rs=1.85)\n\nFig.1: Fermi lines of a monoatomic hexagonal lithium ML at equilibrium, rs=3.02, (a)\nand rs=2.5 (b), and a monoatomic square lithium ML at rs=2.15 (c) and rs=1.85 (d). Solid\nlines correspond to the Fermi line of the s-like band and, as at rs=2.4 the pz-like band\nstarts to be occupied, the Fermi line associated to this band is represented by a\ndashed line. Dotted lines represent the Brillouin zone boundary. The circular shape\nobserved at rs=3.02, which shows a NFE-like behavior at equilibrium, significantly\nbreaks under compression. Particularly, at rs=2.15 the Fermi line becomes a perfect\nsquare, as corresponds to a half filled tight binding-like model, indicating a strong\nelectronic coupling in the \u0393M direction. Although at higher densities the observed\nnesting in the Fermi line breaks, it is noteworthy that around rs=2.15 it induces phase\ntransitions to more complex structures (Rodriguez-Prieto and Bergara 2005a).\n\n\fJoint 20th AIRAPT \u2013 43th EHPRG, June 27 \u2013 July 1, Karlsruhe/Germany 2005\n\nIV. Results.\nAn essential feature determining electronic properties of materials is the geometry of the\nFermi surface. In this section we present the analysis of the pressure induced modification of\nthe Fermi surface in both a lithium monolayer (ML) and bulk. Besides the intrinsic interest to\nanalyze physical properties of systems with reduced dimensionality, our main motivation to\nstudy a ML is related to its simpler geometrical configuration, which allows us to make a\ndeeper analysis of the interesting new physical properties that can be induced by pressure,\nand will be used as well as a first guide for a better understanding of the compressed bulk\nlithium.\na. Li Monolayer:\nLithium ML at equilibrium, rs=3.02 (rs is the two-dimensional linear density parameter, defined\nby the relation A/N=\u03c0(rs a0)2 where N is the number of nuclei in a ML with area A and a0 is the\nBohr radius), favors the compact monoatomic hexagonal structure. However, at rs < 2.25 the\nmore open monoatomic square structure becomes favored over the hexagonal one (Bergara\net al. 2001). As it is shown in Fig. 1a, at equilibrium just one Fermi line exists, associated to\nthe s band, which is almost circular as corresponds to a NFE approximation. However, this\nsimple picture breaks under pressure. For example, at higher densities (rs<2.4) the second\nband, of pz character, starts to be occupied around the \u0393 point. Therefore, at rs=2.15 there\nare two Fermi lines associated to the two occupied s and pz bands and, surprisingly, the\nFermi line associated to the s band becomes a perfect square as corresponds to a half filled\ntight binding-like model (Fig. 1c). As it is well known, this model becomes appropriate to\ndescribe electronic properties of systems with localized electronic states, just being the\nopposite case of the NFE approximation valid at ambient pressures. The perfect nesting\nobserved at rs =2.15 strongly couples electronic states close to the Fermi line along the \u0393M\ndirection, and becomes the physical origin of the proposed phase transitions to more\ncomplex structures at higher densities in the ML (Rodriguez-Prieto and Bergara, 2005a).\n\n2.a\n\n2.b\n\nFig.2: Fermi surfaces of bcc-lithium at equilibrium (a) and fcc-lithium at P=30 GPa (b).\nThe almost perfect sphere obtained at equilibrium confirms the validity of the NFE\napproximation for lithium at ambient pressures. However, under compression the\nsphere becomes strongly distorted, with necks along the \u0393L direction and even\npresents parallel faces along the \u0393K direction.\n\n\fJoint 20th AIRAPT \u2013 43th EHPRG, June 27 \u2013 July 1, Karlsruhe/Germany 2005\n\nb. Li Bulk:\nAt normal conditions of pressure and temperature bulk lithium favors the bcc structure, but\nwith a slight energy difference over the fcc. However, when the applied pressure rises to\naround 8 GPa the fcc structure emerges as the preferred one and it remains favored up to\naround 40 GPa, where new more complex structures (i.e. cI16) starts to be favored\n(Hanfland et al. 2000).\n\n3.a\n\n3.b\n\nFig.3: Fermi surface cross sections (solid lines) of fcc-lithium at 30 GPa along \u0393KX (a)\nand \u0393KL (b) planes. Dotted lines represent the Brillouin zone boundary. Although the\ncross section along the \u0393KX plane shows an almost perfect circle, it becomes highly\ndistorted in the \u0393KL plane with a clear nesting along the \u0393K direction.\nFig. 2 displays the Fermi surface of bcc-lithium at equilibrium (Fig. 2a) and fcc-lithium at\nP=30 GPa (Fig. 2b). The almost perfect sphere obtained at ambient pressure deforms\nsignificantly under compression, losing its spherical shape and, similar to the Fermi surface\nof cooper at normal conditions, presents necks along the \u0393L direction. More interestingly, as\nwill be described bellow, we can also distinguish almost parallel faces connecting each two\nnearest neighbor necks. Fig. 3a and 3b show cross sections of the Fermi surface along (100)\nand (110) planes (\u0393KX and \u0393KL planes), respectively. As a result of the increasing non-local\ncharacter of the pseudopotential (Bergara et al. 2001) the Fermi surface of lithium under\npressure becomes highly anisotropic and, although the cross section along the \u0393KX plane\nshows an almost perfect circle, it becomes highly distorted in the \u0393KL plane and a clear\nnesting in the \u0393K direction (equivalent to the \u0393M direction in the ML) can be also observed.\nIn order to analyze the extension and magnitude of the nesting, Figs. 4a-4d show cross\nsections of the Fermi surface of fcc-lithium at 30 GPa along planes parallel to \u0393KL at 0.2, 0.3,\n0.4 and 0.6 times the \u0393K distance, respectively. It is interesting to point out that the nesting\npersists in the parallel planes and, although the magnitude of the nesting momentum slightly\ndecreases as the cross section plane approaches the zone boundary, its weight increases\nbecause the Fermi surface area connected by the nesting becomes larger. This Fermi\nsurface anisotropy is expected to be the origin of important physical properties in lithium at\nthis pressure range. For example, our preliminary calculations indicate that at around 30 GPa\na phonon mode becomes unstable, associated to the Kohn anomaly corresponding to the\nobserved nesting (Rodriguez-Prieto and Bergara, 2005b), which could explain the complex\nphase transitions observed in this pressure range.\n\n\fJoint 20th AIRAPT \u2013 43th EHPRG, June 27 \u2013 July 1, Karlsruhe/Germany 2005\n\n4.a\n\n4.b\n\n4.c\n\n4.d\n\nFig.4: Fermi surface cross sections (solid lines) of fcc-lithium at 30 GPa along planes\nparallel to the \u0393KL plane at 0.2 (a), 0.3 (b), 0.4 (c) and 0.6 (d) times the \u0393K distance.\nDotted lines represent the Brillouin zone boundary.\nV. Conclusions.\nWe have performed ab initio calculations of the Fermi surface deformation with increasing\npressure in both lithium ML and bulk. According to our calculations, although the nearly free\nelectron model correctly describes the properties of lithium at normal conditions, it loses its\nvalidity as the electronic density increases. As a result of the increasing non-local character\nof the pseudopotential, the Fermi surface becomes highly anisotropic under pressure and at\n30 GPa even shows an extended nesting along the \u0393K direction. Preliminary calculations\nindicate that the observed Fermi surface deformation induces a phonon instability associated\nto the nesting momentum vector (Rodriguez-Prieto and Bergara, 2005b), which can be the\norigin of the observed complex phase transitions in the same pressure range. On the other\nhand, related to the observed phonon softening the electron-phonon interaction might also\nbecome large in lithium under pressure, so that an analysis based on the evolution of the\nFermi surface might also provide a new perspective to understand the experimentally\nobserved high superconducting transition temperature.\nVI.
