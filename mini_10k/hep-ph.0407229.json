These determinations are important\nin extracting the remaining CKM matrix elements.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA large scale experimental and theoretical effort is underway to overconstrain\nthe CKM matrix and uncover any internal inconsistencies revealing new physics.\nUncertainties in determinations of the CKM elements arise not only from experiment but also, in no small part, from the theoretical calculations needed to\naccount for hadronic QCD effects. Within the next few years the theoretical\nuncertainties must be reduced to the few percent level in order not to dominate\nuncertainties from experiment.\n\n\fB decay and mixing processes are most suitable for extracting |Vub |, |Vcb |,\n|Vtd |, and |Vts |; a large fraction of the CKM matrix. The QCD coupling at the\nrelevant hadronic scales is large and thus a non perturbative method is needed.\nLattice QCD holds the most promise in being able to provide the required\nhadronic factors with the required accuracy. Recent lattice QCD results give\nconfidence that the required precision calculations are now possible.\nThis paper reviews the current status of lattice QCD calculations for\nthe semileptonic decays of the B mesons needed to determine Vub and Vcb .\nAdditionally, semileptonic D meson decay calculations, suitable as rigorous\nchecks of lattice methods, are discussed.\n2\n\nLattice QCD\n\nLattice QCD (see, e.g. 1) ) involves the use of a mathematical 'trick' where\nspacetime is discretized into a finite lattice. Quarks live on the lattice points\nand gluons live on the links between the points. This formalism regularizes\nQCD by providing a momentum cut-off: no momenta greater than \u03c0/a can\npropagate where a, typically \u223c 0.1fm, is the lattice spacing. The Feynman\npath integral becomes an ordinary integral over a finite number of degrees\nof freedom, and can be computed numerically on a computer. Continuum\nQCD results can be obtained by taking the lattice spacing to zero, provided\nthat the matching factors, or differences between the continuum and lattice\nrenormalization schemes, have been taken into account. In heavy-light physics\nthese matching factors are usually determined by comparing a perturbative\ncontinuum calculation with the corresponding perturbative calculation on the\nlattice.\nUnfortunately, the numerical integrations corresponding to the Feynman\npath integral are extremely computationally expensive. Even with the use of\nefficient Monte Carlo methods approximations must be done in order to obtain\nresults with the computational technology of today. A dramatic saving can be\nmade by ignoring closed quark loops in the vacuum, and the vast majority of\nlattice calculations have been done in this so called quenched approximation.\nThe use of this incorrect theory, however, leads to systematical errors at the\n10-20% level. Unquenched calculations must be done in order to achieve the\nabove precision results.\nIn unquenched calculations, when vacuum or dynamical quarks are in-\n\n\fcluded, the expense of the simulation increases dramatically with decreasing\ndynamical quark mass, meaning that in practice the light dynamical quarks are\nincluded with masses greater than their physical masses. If light enough, however, extrapolations can be done to the correct physical masses with the help\nof 'chiral perturbation theory' (see, e.g. 2) ): an effective theory involving expansions around the massless limit. Up until recently, unquenched simulations\nhave not been able to reach this 'chiral regime'.\nNow for the first time, simulations have been done with dynamical quarks\nlight enough to allow the agreement at the 3% level of theory with experiment\nfor a variety of (simply calculable) quantities 3) . These simulations have been\npossible due to the combination of ever increasing computing power and the\nemergence of a better understanding about the properties of quarks on the\nlattice, which has lead to the use of the so called improved staggered formulation.\nThis was used by the MILC collaboration (see 4, 5) and references therein) to\ncreate ensembles of 'configurations' (snapshots of the QCD vacuum on the\nlattice) which are then used to 'measure' required physical quantities such as\nthose above.\n3\n\nHeavy Quarks on the Lattice\n\nNaive discretization of heavy quark fields leads to large O(amQ ) discretization\nerrors due to large heavy quark mass mQ . However, one can use effective theories which take advantage of the fact that the heavy quarks typically have low\nvelocities within the hadron, and are therefore somewhat non-relativistic. This\nalso often results in simplifications reducing simulation time and allowing high\nstatistics. The calculations reviewed in this paper incorporate two alternative\nheavy quark methods.\nNon Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) 6) involves an expansion of the QCD\nLagrangian in powers of 1/mQ . This is very useful for b quarks but not so\nappropriate for c quarks.\nThe Fermilab method 7) (although more complicated than NRQCD) is\nvery appropriate for c quarks as it incorporates smooth transitions from relativistic light quarks to non relativistic heavy quarks.\n\n\f4\n\nSemileptonic Decays\n\nRecently the first fully unquenched results for the semileptonic decay form\nfactors have appeared and, although preliminary, are very promising.\nThe matrix element for the decay of a heavy B or D meson to a pion is\ngiven by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\nMH\n\u2212 m2\u03c0 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\nh\u03c0(p\u03c0 )| V |H(pH )i = f+ (q ) pH + p\u03c0 \u2212\nq\nq2\nM 2 \u2212 m2\n+f0 (q 2 ) H 2 \u03c0 q \u03bc\nq\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u2261\n(1)\n2mH f|| (E\u03c0 )v \u03bc + f\u22a5 (E\u03c0 )p\u03bc\u22a5\n\nwhere v \u03bc = p\u03bcH /MH and p\u03bc\u22a5 = p\u03bc\u03c0 \u2212 E\u03c0 v \u03bc become (1, ~0) and (0, p~\u03c0 ) respectively\nin the heavy meson rest frame.\nThe alternative f|| (E\u03c0 ) and f\u22a5 (E\u03c0 ) form factors have been introduced\nbecause they are more appropriate for lattice calculations and the associated\nchiral perturbation theory formulae are usually given in terms of E\u03c0 , the pion\nenergy in the heavy meson rest frame. It is straightforward to interchange\nbetween these two conventions.\nUnfortunately, experimental results are limited to the small q 2 region\nwhereas, for B mesons, lattice calculations are most reliable for small recoil\n(large q 2 ). This is because lattice calculations currently work in the B meson\nrest frame and large recoil would give the pion large momenta introducing large\nO(a2 p2\u03c0 ) discretization errors and large statistical errors. However, the lattice\ncommunity is excited about the development of Moving NRQCD 8) which\nallows the momentum to be shared between the B and the \u03c0. This will allow\ncalculations over the full q 2 range providing excellent overlap with experiment\nand should be ready to implement within the next year.\nIn the mean time it is necessary to use a model in order to extrapolate the\nlattice results to the low q 2 region. It will, however, be seen that results using\nthe Becirevic Kaidalov (BK) parameterization 9) are encouraging. The BK\nparameterization satisfies Heavy Quark Effective Theory scaling laws, the fact\nthat f+ must have a pole at q 2 = MB2 \u2217 and the necessary condition f+ (0) =\nf0 (0).\n\n\flin[solid], \u03c7PT[dashed], stag_\u03c7PT[dotted] fits (4 points)\n1.4\n1.2\n\na\n\n\u22121/2\n\nfperp/\u03c1V\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n2\n\n(aE) =0.15\n2\n(aE) =0.25\n2\n(aE) =0.35\n2\n(aE) =0.45\n\n0.4\n\nD\u2212>\u03c0\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nml\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\nD\u2192\u03c0\nFigure 1: Chiral extrapolations for f\u22a5\nwith Fermilab heavy quarks 10) .\nSolid: linear; dashed: chiral perturbation theory without staggered effects;\ndotted: full staggered chiral perturbation theory.\n\n5\n\nSemileptonic D Decay Results\n\nThe CKM elements |Vcs | and |Vcd | are known more accurately than |Vub | and\nthe CLEO-c program aims to further improve this accuracy 11) . Semileptonic\nD decays are thus very suitable processes for testing lattice calculations.\nUsing the MILC ensembles and Fermilab heavy quarks, Okamoto et al 10)\nhave calculated the D \u2192 \u03c0 (and similarly D \u2192 K) form factors. Lattice\ndeterminations of the matrix element Eq. 1 were done for several q 2 and\nlight quark mass mq . For each mq , the BK parameterization was used to\ninterpolate to common E\u03c0 values. Then, for each E\u03c0 , chiral extrapolations were\ndone to obtain results at the physical light quark masses. Chiral perturbation\ntheory is used to give the appropriate extrapolation function, dependent on\nthe lattice action used. Figure 1 shows chiral extrapolations for f\u22a5 . The\ncorrect (full staggered) chiral extrapolation is shown along with linear and nonstaggered functions. \u03c1v is a matching factor between the lattice and continuum\nrenormalization schemes which is 1 at tree-level.\nFigure 2 shows results for linearly1 chirally extrapolated form factors as\n1\n\nThe analysis for the full staggered chirally extrapolated form factors is\nunderway.\n\n\f1.5\n\n1\n\nf0/\u03c1V\nf+/\u03c1V\nexperiment\n\nD\u2212>\u03c0\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nf0/\u03c1V\nf+/\u03c1V\nexperiment\n\nD\u2212>K\n0.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nq [GeV ]\n\nFigure 2: D \u2192 \u03c0 and D \u2192 K form factors with Fermilab heavy quarks 10) .\na function of q 2 for both D \u2192 \u03c0 and D \u2192 K. In both cases good agreement\nwith experiment at q 2 = 0 is seen, although the CLEO-c results will provide a\nmore stringent test over the full q 2 range.\nThere exists one set of MILC ensembles with a relatively large lattice\nspacing (the 'coarse' set) and there similarly exists a 'fine' set. This work has\nso far only been done on the coarse ensembles and must be repeated on the\nfine ensembles to check for lattice spacing dependence.\n6\n\nB \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd Results\n\nThe MILC coarse ensembles were again used for B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd calculations. Both\nNRQCD and Fermilab heavy quarks have been used.\nIn similar fashion to the D decay analysis, the form factor results were\ninterpolated to common E\u03c0 values and chiral extrapolations were performed,\nbut only linearly so far. Figure 3 shows these extrapolations for f|| and f\u22a5\nfor the NRQCD case 12) . The full staggered chiral function has recently been\ndetermined and must now be incorporated into this analysis. The BK parameterization was then used to extrapolate to the low q 2 region, as can be seen\n\n\fB\u2192\u03c0\nFigure 3: Linear chiral extrapolations for f||B\u2192\u03c0 and f\u22a5\nwith NRQCD heavy\n12)\nquarks\n.\n\non the left hand side of figure 4. The data fits the model excellently with f+\nexhibiting the expected pole at q 2 = MB2 \u2217 and with f0 consistent with the soft\npion relation f0 (MB2 ) = fB /f\u03c0 . Although f0 is not needed for the decay rate,\nit has relatively small statistical errors and its inclusion in the fit is very useful\nin constraining f+ . These results include one-loop matching but O(1/amb )\ncurrents have still to be included, and again this work must be repeated on the\nfine ensembles. This plot includes old quenched results for comparison, some\nof which have had their errors removed for clarity.\nAn equivalent plot of results with Fermilab quarks 10) is shown on the\nright hand side of figure 4, again comparing with old quenched results. In this\ncase again only the coarse ensembles have been used, only tree level matching\nhas been done, and mb is not tuned well.

It is encouraging that these results agree with each other, and are\nconsistent with the current inclusive B decay determinations 14) .\nIt is hoped that the lattice errors for this quantity will be at around the\n10-13% level when this analysis is complete. The main sources of error are\nuncertainties in chiral extrapolations, continuum extrapolations and matching.\nEstimates have been made as to how the magnitude of the overall error will\nreduce with future calculations 15) . The next generation of machines, being\nbuilt just now, should allow simulations where a2 or ml is halved, shrinking the\nerror to the 5.5-6.5% level, assuming that 2-loop matching has been performed.\nLooking further ahead, if both a2 and ml could be halved it is hoped that 4-5%\nprecision will be possible, again assuming 2-loop matching. The timescale for\nthis, however, is not known.\n\n\f7\n\nB \u2192 D\u2217 l\u03bd Results\n\nThe differential B \u2192 D\u2217 l\u03bd decay width is given by\n\nd\u0393\n(4)\n\u221d |Vcb |FB\u2192D\u2217 (\u03c9)\nd\u03c9\nwhere \u03c9 = v \u2032 .v and v and v \u2032 are the B and D four-velocities respectively. In\norder to extract |Vcb |, the form factor at zero recoil F (1) must be determined.\nSince B and D mesons can both be considered heavy, heavy quark symmetry\ncan be exploited. The errors then scale with 1 \u2212 F (1) instead of F (1) because\nin the infinitely heavy quark limit F (1) = 1 16) .\nThe best lattice determination thus far, which is in the quenched approximation and uses Fermilab heavy quarks, is given by 17)\n+0.003 +0.000 +0.006\nFB\u2192D\u2217 (1) = 0.913+0.024\n\u22120.017 \u00b1 0.016\u22120.014 \u22120.016 \u22120.014\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the errors are from statistics, matching, lattice spacing dependence, chiral extrapolation, and quenching respectively.\nWith reference to the previous section, it is hoped that this total error\nwill be reduced from 4% to around the 2% level with the next generation of\nmachines and then to as low as 1% with the next again generation. At this\nlevel, it will be important to compute the slope and curvature of F (\u03c9), and\nMoving NRQCD will again be of great help in achieving this.\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nUnquenched lattice gauge theory calculations are appearing, and have already\nmade an impact. The lattice community is confident that such calculations\ncan now be done to obtain the quantities important for extracting the CKM\nelements, including the semileptonic B decay form factors. Comparison of D\nsemileptonic decay lattice results with precise CLEO-c data should enhance\nthis confidence.\nThe calculations are still at a preliminary stage, but good understanding\nexists on, and plans are in place to address, all sources of error. Precision\nresults are likely to appear within the next few years.\nReferences\n1. R. Gupta, hep-lat/9807028.\n\n\f2. D. Arndt, hep-lat/0406011.\n3. HPQCD, C. T. H. Davies et al., Phys. Rev.
