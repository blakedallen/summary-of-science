KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1. Introduction\nPeriods of exponential growth of supermassive black holes\nare observed as quasars in the distant Universe. These\nquasars, however, are only seen to outshine their host galaxy\nif the geometry of the dusty torus surrounding the accretion\ndisk is at a favourable angle (Antonucci 1993). These are\nknown as type-1 quasars, which show a spatially-unresolved\n\"blue bump\" in the UV-optical wavebands, as well as broad\nemission lines. The activity of such type-1 quasars is known\nto increase with lookback time, and seems to have peaked\naround z \u223c 2 (Wolf et al. 2003). However, the understanding\nof the obscured quasar population (known as type-2 quasars)\nis far less complete, and it is not known how much growth\noccurs in obscured regions.\nOne of the problems in understanding the amount of obscured growth is that there are several discrepancies in the ratio of type-2 to type-1 quasars, depending on the wavelength\nat which these are observed.\n\u2013 Unified schemes, where type-1 and type-2 objects are the\nsame intrinsically but viewed at a different orientation\nwith respect to the torus, predict type-2 to type-1 ratios\nCorrespondence to: ams@astro.ox.ac.uk\n\n\u223c 1, for a half-opening angle of \u223c 40\u25e6 . Studies of radioloud AGN are consistent with this picture (Willott et al.\n2000).\n\u2013 The summed emission from quasars generates the cosmic\nX-ray background, and modelling of this background is\nconsistent with a population of type-2 quasars that outnumber the type-1s by \u223c3:1 (Worsley et al. 2004).\n\u2013 Deep X-ray surveys are sensitive to intrinsically faint\nAGN down to the Seyfert regime and have found an obscured population but this population is not large enough\nto account for the unresolved X-ray background (Zheng\net al. 2004; Barger et al. 2005).\nPossible explanations for these discrepancies include a\nnumber of Compton thick quasars (e.g. Alexander et al.\n2005), which are invisible even to deep X-ray surveys,\nand another type of optical obscuration unrelated to the\ntorus. With objects such as IRAS F10214 in mind (RowanRobinson et al. 1991), and following the success of midinfrared selection at lower redshift (Lacy et al. 2004; 2005a),\nwe devised an alternative method for looking for radio-quiet\ntype-2 quasars at the peak of the quasar activity (z \u223c 2).\nIn order to be able to compare this population to the type-1\nquasars, we used well defined selection criteria.\n\n\f3 OBSERVATIONAL RESULTS\n\n2. Selection Criteria\nOur first step in choosing a method of hunting for the elusive high redshift type-2 population is to consider the effects of dust on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a\ntype-1 quasar. Figure 1 shows the X-ray to far-infrared SED\nfor two quasars, one with AV = 0 (a type-1) and another\nwith AV = 10 (a moderate extinction for a type-2). We see\nthat the effect of dust is negligible at (observed) far- to midinfrared, but suddenly becomes very severe in the mid- to\nnear-infrared. The far- to mid- infrared SED of a type-1 and\ntype-2 are thus almost identical, while the type-2 quasar SED\nwill be dominated by the host galaxy at near-infrared to UV\nwavelenghts. With this in mind, we used the 1.4 GHz, 24-\u03bcm\nand 3.6-\u03bcm data from the Spitzer First Look Survey (Condon et al. 2003; Marleau et al. 2004; Lacy et al. 2005b; Fadda\net al. in prep.) and the following selection criteria (Mart\u0131\u0301nezSansigre et al. 2005):\n1. S24 \u03bcm > 300 \u03bcJy\n2. S3.6\u03bcm \u2264 45 \u03bcJy\n3. 350 \u03bcJy \u2264 S1.4 GHz \u2264 2 mJy\nThe mid-infrared criterion S24\u03bcm > 300 \u03bcJy was chosen\nto select quasars below the \"break\" in the luminosity function at z \u223c 2. The peak of the quasar activity occurred at\nthis redshift and by targeting the quasars around the \"break\"\nwe would be sensitive to the dominant part of the population. At z = 2, the break in the quasar luminosity function, L\u2217quasar , corresponds to MB = \u221225.7 (Croom et al.\n2004, with Pure Luminosity Evolution), so assuming a typical quasar SED (Rowan-Robinson 1995) our 24-\u03bcm selection will select quasars just below the break in the luminos\u2217\nity function ( >\n\u223c 0.2 Lquasar ) at z = 2, and more luminous\nquasars at higher redshifts.\nQuasars are normally considered as being type-2 if they\nhave an AV >\n\u223c 5 (Simpson et al. 1999) which will make\ntheir observed near-infrared emission much fainter than that\nof type-1s. The 3.6-\u03bcm criterion was therefore chosen to\nremove naked (type-1) quasars as well as lower redshift\n(z <\n\u223c 1.4) type-2s. Dust extinction ensures that type-2 quasars\nare much fainter than type-1 quasars, even for a moderate\nAV . Indeed, the S3.6\u03bcm emission (rest-frame 1-2 \u03bcm) is\nlikely to be dominated by starlight for AV \u2265 10, and since\nlight at 3.6-\u03bcm is dominated by the old stellar population,\nthere will be an S3.6\u03bcm \u2212z correlation, analogous to the K \u2212z\nrelation for radio galaxies (Willott et al. 2003). Assuming that\nhost galaxies for z = 2 radio-quiet quasars have a luminosity of 2L\u2217gal (Kukula et al. 2001), we adapt the K \u2212 z relation to 2L\u2217gal hosts at 3.6-\u03bcm. This criterion corresponds to\na limiting 'photometric redshift' zphot >\n\u223c 1.4. This was chosen to target z \u223c 2 type-2 quasars, while allowing for scatter\nin the photometric redshift estimation and filtering out type1 quasars and low-redshift contaminants like radio galaxies.\nThe infrared selection criteria are plotted schematically in\nFigure 2.\nThe radio selection criteria is added to ensure that the\ncandidates are radio-quiet quasars rather than starburst galaxies. The 3.6-\u03bcm - 24-\u03bcm \"colour\" we are demanding can be\n\nFig. 1. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of AMS05, a\nz = 2 type-2 quasar (fit by eye). The data points are (left\nto right) observed 1.4 GHz (bottom left) and 24, 8, 5.8, 4.5\nand 3.6 \u03bcm from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Type-1 SED\n(dashed line) is from Rowan-Robinson (1995). We have removed the far-infrared 'bump' as we have no information\non it. To obtain the type-2 SED (solid line) we applied the\ndust model from Pei (1992). The host galaxy is 2L\u2217 from\nBruzual & Charlot (2003). We can see that for an extinction\nof AV > 10 the 24 \u03bcm flux density will be identical for a\ntype-1 and a type-2, while the 3.6 \u03bcm flux density will be\ndominated by the host galaxy, allowing us to apply a '3.6\n\u03bcm-z relation' to obtain rough photometric redshifts.\nachieved by lower redshift (z \u2264 1) ULIRGs. To avoid such\nstarburst contaminants, we chose a lower limit on S1.4GHz\nwell above the level reached by high-redshift starburst galaxies (Chapman et al. 2005) as well as an upper limit to filter\nout the radio-loud objects, whose extended jets might complicate interpretation. We do not demand a detection at 3.6-\u03bcm,\nallowing for very high-redshift objects. In addition, the FLS\nradio positions (Condon et al. 2003), accurate to \u223c 0.5 arcsec, were better for spectrosocopic follow-up than the 24-\u03bcm\npositions.\n\n3. Observational Results\nThese selection criteria led to 21 candidate type-2 radio-quiet\nquasars in the 3.8 square degrees of the Spitzer First Look\nRegion that have coverage with all three wavebands. To obtain optical spectra, the 21 candidates were looked at for\n\u223c 30 minutes each with the ISIS instrument at the WHT.\nThis yielded 10 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.4 \u2264\nz \u2264 4.2, 10 blank spectra and one with faint red continuum.\nThe spectrum of the highest redshift object is shown in Figure 3. All the objects with redshifts showed narrow emission\nlines and no type-1 quasar or lower redshift starbursts were\nfound to contaminate the sample (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al.\n2005; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. in prep.). In the remainder of\nthis paper we will refer to the candidates with spectroscopic\nredshifts as narrow-lined objects, and the rest as blank objects.\n\n\f5 DISCUSSION\n\nFig. 2. (from Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. 2005) The sources\nplotted all obey the radio criterion, so they are all AGN.\nCrosses and upper limits are sources that do not make the infrared criteria. Triangles are sources with spectroscopic redshifts, diamonds are sources with blank spectra or no lines.\nThe track for a z = 1 quasar (solid line) shows that any\nquasar bright enough to make the 24-\u03bcm criterion (upper half\nof the figure) will be too bright to make the 3.6-\u03bcm criterion\nif it has an extinction between AV = 0 and AV \u223c 25. If the\nextinction is larger (AV > 25) then the 3.6 \u03bcm emission will\nbe dominated by the host galaxy (the cross at z = 1) which\nis still too bright to make our cut. A quasar at z = 2 (dashed\nline) bright enough to make the 24-\u03bcm criterion will also be\ntoo bright unless it has an AV >\n\u223c 10\n\u223c 6. Any quasar with AV >\nwill, in addition, have its 3.6 \u03bcm light dominated by the host\ngalaxy. This allows us to apply a rough photometric redshift\nestimate, based on the K \u2212 z relation.\nEight of the objects showed narrow Lyman-\u03b1 with equivalent width > 100 nm, and several objects showed higherexcitation lines. The object with faint red continuum is probably a type-2 with z < 1.7 so that Lyman-\u03b1 is not visible\nin the optical, and has no other lines bright enough to be detected. There is therefore no evidence for contamination in\nour sample.\n\n4. Modelling the Population\nTo place our results in context, we modelled the expected\nnumber of type-1 quasars with z \u2265 2 which would meet our\n24 \u03bcm and 1.4 GHz selection criteria. We used a type-1 luminosity function (LF) from the COMBO-17 survey (Wolf\net al. 2003) and a model SED (Rowan-Robinson 1995) to\nconvert between rest-frame B-band luminosity and observed\n24 \u03bcm flux density. To model the radio selection, we used\nan optical-to-radio correlation with scatter (Cirasuolo et al.\n2003). From this modelling, we would expect 4.3+2.2\n\u22121.1 type-1\nquasars at z \u2265 2 matching our mid-infrared and radio criteria. This number is small mainly due to the radio cut: we are\nlooking at the radio-bright end of the radio-quiet quasar population. Without the radio criterion we would expect \u223c 55\ntype-1 quasars.\n\nFig. 3. (from Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. 2005) The spectrum of\nAMS16, the highest redshift type-2 in our sample, showing\nhigh-excitation lines as well as Lyman-\u03b1.\nUsing a Bayesian approach, we produced probability distributions for the quasar fraction at z \u2265 2, q given our data\nand assuming 4.3 type-1 quasars (where q is the fraction of\ntype-1 quasars over the total number of type-1 and type-2\nquasars). Two such distributions were calculated (Figure 4):\none where only the spectroscopically confirmed type-2s with\nz \u2265 2 were included (5 type-2s) and one were the photometric redshifts were used for the objects with no spectroscopic\nredshift (for a total of 11 type-2s with z \u2265 2).\nIf we only take the redshift of the objects with lines in\nthe spectra, then the quasar fraction, q is consistent with \u223c\n0.5 and the type-2 to type-1 ratio is \u223c1:1. The probability\ndistribution peaks at q \u223c 0.25 when the photometric redshifts\nare used to fill in, resulting in a type-2 to type-1 ratio \u223c3:1.\nFigure 4 also includes the predicted q for two recedingtorus models (Simpson 1998; 2005). These are consistent\nwith the quasar fraction from narrow-line objects at the 1\u03c3\nlevel, and with q from both narrow-line and blank objects at\nthe 2\u03c3 level.\n\n5. Discussion\nWe have found two possible values for the quasar fraction, q.\nThe spectroscopic redshifts are, on average, consistent with\nthe photometric redshifts, indicating that the host galaxies\nof the narrow-line objects are consistent with progenitors of\npresent-day 2L\u2217 elliptical galaxies. The narrow line objects\nare therefore hosted by relatively dust-free (and hence transparent) galaxies so we can see the narrow line region. The\nquasars in the narrow-line objects are therefore obscured by\nthe torus around the accretion disk. The ratio of narrow-line\ntype-2 to type-1 is consistent with this torus picture. Type-1\nquasars must also be hosted by relatively transparent galaxies\n(i.e. ellipticals, Kukula et al. 2001), so we find that the quasar\nfraction in high-redshift elliptical galaxies is consistent with\nq \u223c 0.5 as expected from unified schemes.\nThe blank objects, however, are almost certainly also in\nthe redshift range 1.4 \u2264 z \u2264 5. Our photometric redshifts\nare reliable on average, and there is no hint of contamination\n\n\fReferences\n\nReferences\nde Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia for financial support for this conference.

(from Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. 2005) The probability\ndistributions for the quasar fraction, q, given our data and assuming 4.3 type-1 quasars at z \u2265 2 would satisfy our 24 \u03bcm\nand radio criteria. The solid line is the distribution if we only\ntake our type-2 quasars with spectroscopic redshift z \u2265 2,\nwhile the dashed line is the distribution if we add those with\nphotometric z \u2265 2. The two receding-torus models labelled\nare RT1: Simpson (1998) and RT2: Simpson (2005).\nby type-1s or lower-redshift starbursts (which would show the\n[OII] 3727 \u00c5 line in the red end of the spectra or at least some\nbright continuum). We are therefore confident that the blank\nobjects are also high redshift type-2s but the quasar is probably obscured by some dust on scales large enough to obscure\nthe narrow-line region as well as the broad-line region. Such\nkpc-scale dust is characteristic of starbursts, and we could\ntherefore be seeing supermassive black holes growing inside\nstarbursting galaxies (Fabian 1999). The orientation of the\ntorus would therefore become irrelevant for the blank objects,\nas the obscuring dust would be distributed along the entire\nhost galaxy.\nThis would explain why the ratio of narrow-line ('hostobscured') type-2s to type-1s is \u223c1:1, while the total ratio\nof type-2s ('host-obscured' and 'torus-obscured') to type1s would be \u223c3:1, consistent with the X-ray background\n(Worsley et al. 2004). Unified schemes can only be tested\nin relatively transparent galaxies, where the obscuration is\ndue to orientation, so the receding-torus models (Simpson\n1998; 2005) must only be compared to the curve that uses\nthe narrow-line objects and they are consistent. However, for\nthe X-ray background the location of the obscuring material\nis irrelevant: at high-redshift there are \u223c 3 times more obscured quasars than unobscured. Hence, 50-80% of the accretion at 2 \u2264 z \u2264 5 is obscured by dust . Since this is the\npeak of the quasar activity and since at lower redshifts, most\nAGN are obscured (from X-ray studies: Barger et al. 2005),\nwe can conclude that most supermassive black hole growth is\nobscured by dust (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. 2005).\nAcknowledgements.
