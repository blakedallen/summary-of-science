Rotation\ncurves are the major tool for determining the distribution of mass in spiral galaxies, and are also important to study\nkinematics and to infer the evolutionary histories in galactic systems. Historically they are the most basic and classic\nmanner to infer the presence of dark matter in galaxies (for a complete review about rotation curves, see for instance\n[2]). On the other hand, it is verified that cluster of galaxies are composed of three main components: \u223c 5% in\nmass is the optically luminous baryonic matter in hundred of bright galaxies; \u223c 15% is in the form of a bright X-ray\ninter-cluster gas; and the remaining \u223c 80% is some sort of non-baryonic \"missing mass\". Such techniques plus the\ntemperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Background Radiation have been regarded as confirming the dark matter\nexistence.\nIn [5], a thin disk constructed from a space-time endowed with extra dimensions just provide the needed extra\nparameters to construct, without dark matter, a configuration that mimics a generic and idealized axially symmetric\ngalaxy. At this same reference, an impressive result was also obtained for gravitational lensing effects for a spherical\ncluster living within the same space-time. These outcomes are directly related to the dark matter problem, as it is\nexplained above, in the sense that \"dark matter\" can be translated as an ignorance to explain why spiral galaxies have\nexotic rotation curves (see e.g. [2, 6] and references therein), galaxy clusters have a greater amount of ray deflection\nthan expected for gravitational lensing [4] (and also mass when confronted to virial theorem [1]), and the universe\nappears to have an unexpected few fraction of baryons produced during nucleosynthesis [7].\nIn the present text it is given a phenomenological example where the previous thin disk model is naturally extended\nby using an isotropic configuration to construct a galaxy as mentioned in [8]. Unlike the results obtained for the\nthin disk model, where the galaxy is interpreted as a flux and counterflux of geodesic particles, at the present article\nwe obtain a stable configuration similar to a spiral galaxy, i.e., where we have a central bulge and a thick disk\ndisplayed in a particular density profile. In this way, the \"artificial\" galaxy constructed by the previous thin disk is\nsubstituted here by a richer model and a more realistic configuration. The design is totaly carried out by a 4D isotropic\nconfiguration living in a multidimensional universe. It is constructed a 6D galaxy following the arguments about the\nsimplicity of self-gravitating objects living in six dimensions (even number of space-time dimensions) presented in\n\n\u2217\n\nP. S. Letelier passed away in June, 9th 2011. The present constitutes a posthumous publication.\naddress: carlos.coimbra@ufpr.br\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\n[5]. The obtained Einstein equations allow the system to be solved by Miyamoto-Nagai solutions. Such solutions\nare important because they describe a family of self-gravitating configurations that can be seen as three-dimensional\nmodels for the distribution of mass in galaxies [8, 10].\nThe present work is organized as follows: in Section II the field equations are calculated from a 4D isotropic metric\nplus extra terms and a Miyamoto-Nagai ansatz is used to solve them. In Section III a general equation for the circular\ngeodesics in the planar part of the configuration is calculated and it is argued that such equation could approximately\nrepresent the rotation curves and in Section IV we use a general relativistic exact method to calculate the stability of\nsuch curves. Many spiral galaxies can be constructed from our results and in Section V it is presented an example for\na well known galaxy (NGC 3198) and the density profile from the obtairned rotation curves is recovered and compared\nwith the Newtonian potential and other examples. Finally in Section VII we present some concluding remarks. In\nwhat follows we use c = 1 and G = 1 (and do not consider possible variations of c or G with space, time or number\nof dimensions).\nII.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS\n\nConsider a generalization where our universe has D = 4 + n dimensions. For an Einstein\u2013Hilbert gravitational\naction we have\n1\nS=\n16\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd4 xdn y\n\nwhat leads to the field equations\n(4+n)\n\np\n\u2212(4+n) g\n\nGAB = \u22128\u03c0\n\n(4+n)\n\n(4+n)\n\nR,\n\nTAB ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A, B = 0, 1, ..., 4 + n \u2212 1, y are the extradimensions and the indices (4 + n) tells about the multidimensional\nnature of the action. In many theories of compactified extra dimensions it is calculated a new Newton constant G\nfor dimensions greater than 1 + 3. Here we relax about compactification and maintain the usual value for G. First\nof all, let us consider the case of axial-symmetric 4D space-times whose metric can be written in a isotropic form in\ncylindrical coordinates (t, R, z, \u03c6):\nds2 = e\u03bd(R,z) dt2 \u2212 e\u03bb(R,z) (dR2 + dz 2 + R2 d\u03c62 ).\n\n(3)\n\nA general relativistic formulation for the Newtonian well known galaxy models can be written in the form of the\nSchwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates (see e.g. [10]). Also, as a form to extend the formalism developed in [5],\nwe introduce n extradimensional coordinates. For this case, it is showed in [5] that non-exotic matter is only possible\n(including the fact about a satisfactory Huygens principle) if n is even. Let us consider e.g. the simplest case, where\nn = 2:\nds2 =\n\n(1 \u2212 f )2 2\ndt \u2212 (1 + f )4 [dR2 + dz 2 + R2 d\u03c62 ]\n(1 + f )2\n\u2212e\u2212k dx2 \u2212 ek dy 2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f = f (R, z) and k = k(R, z). The field equations (2) yield the next expressions for the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. The Ttt component is calculated as:\nTtt\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n1\nf,R\n2\n2\n2\n3\n2\n=\n(1 + f ) + (k,R \u2212 k,z )(f + f + f + 1) .\n16 f,RR + f,zz +\n32\u03c0(1 + f )7\nR\n\n(5)\n\nHere as a first approximation it will be assumed that the density profile coincides with the Newtonian potential in\n3D and so one can rewrite the above expression only with visible components as\nTtt =\nand therefore the constraint\n\n1\n2\u03c0(1 + f )5\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf,R\n,\nf,RR + f,zz +\nR\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\n\n2\n2\nk,R\n\u2212 k,z\n= 0.\n\n(7)\n\nIt is a very interesting approach because we can at the same time obtain a observational quantity that can be compared\nwith what is observed in real galaxies and a differential equation that gives the aspect of the extradimensional function\nk(R, z). The general solutions for this last have the form\nk = k1 (z \u2212 R) + k2 or k = k1 (z + R) + k2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are constants, and for simplicity we will consider k2 = 0. Also, with a such constraint, the 4D part\nof pressure solutions are the same as obtained by Vogt and Letelier [10]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf f,R\n1\n2\n2\nR\n+ 2f,R \u2212 f,z ,\n(9)\nf f,zz +\nTR =\n4\u03c0(1 + f )5 (1 \u2212 f )\nR\nTzz =\n\n1\n4\u03c0(1 + f )5 (1 \u2212 f )\n\nTzR = TRz = \u2212\nT\u03c6\u03c6 =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf f,R\n2\n2\n,\nf f,RR +\n+ 2f,z\n\u2212 f,R\nR\n\n1\n(f f,Rz \u2212 3f,R f,z ) ,\n4\u03c0(1 + f )5 (1 \u2212 f )\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\n2\n2\n.\nf (f,RR + f,zz ) \u2212 f,R\n\u2212 f,z\n5\n4\u03c0(1 + f ) (1 \u2212 f )\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nThe extradimensional pressure part has the form\nTxx\n\ne\u2212 k\n=\n4\u03c0(1 + f )5\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf,R\n,\nf,RR + f,zz +\nR\n\nTyy = \u2212Txx.\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThe last two equations permit one to interpret the model as part of some universal extradimensional theory. The\nenergy density is given by \u03c1 = Ttt , and the stresses (pressures or tensions) along a particular direction read Pi = \u2212Tii\nwhen the energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. It is a surprising fact that the component Ttt is proporcional to the\nusual Laplacian of the function f in f lat cylindrical coordinates. Note that in the Newtonian limit when f \u226a 1, Eq.\n(6) reduces to Poisson equation\n\u22072 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0\u03c1N ,\n\n(15)\n\nif the function f is related to the gravitational potential \u03a6 by\n\u03a6\nf =\u2212 .\n2\nIn this case, \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1N and the energy conditions for the disk has no exotic matter\nX\nPi > 0.\n\u03c1+\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\ni\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor will be diagonal (TzR = TRz = 0) provided f has the form\nC\nf= p\n,\nw(R) + g(z)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere C is a constant and w(R) and g(z) are arbitrary functions. Complementarily, TRR and T\u03c6\u03c6 will be equal (isotropic\nradial and azimuthal stresses) only if w(R) = R2 . The density profile \u03c1 can now be deduced, e.g., by Miyamoto-Nagai\n\n\f4\n\n180\n\nNGC 3198 (Begeman 1989)\n\n160\n\nVrot (km/s)\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\nBegeman (1989)\nGEDi Miyamoto-Nagai galaxy\n4D Miyamoto-Nagai galaxy\n\n80\n\nTotal mass considered:\n9\nGas ~ 4.9 x 10\nM\n\n60\n\nStars ~ 34 x 10\n\n40\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n9\n\nM\n\n(Begeman 1989)\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nR (kpc)\n\nFIG. 1: Rotation curves of NGC3198 implemented from gravitation with extra dimensions (GEDi, here with six dimensions)\nand a pure 4D Miyamoto-Nagai solution. The plots come only from the mass due to gas and stars, i.e., no dark matter\nis considered. The discrepancy at 5-7 kpc is due to the fact that our method is not a fitting technique and also the gas\ndynamics was not modeled. The result comes from circular geodesics of test particles around the designed configuration. We\nuse b/a = 0.01 (that models a disky galaxy) and the stability parameter used here is k1 = 10\u22126 . To address stability we use\nalso (for extradimensional parameters) Cx = 0.2 and Cy = 0.8.\n\nsolutions [8], which represent stratifications of mass in the central bulges and in the disk parts of galaxies. In this\ncase, the simplest gravitational potential that provides diagonal components is\nM\n\u03a6(R, z) = \u2212 q\n,\n\u221a\nR2 + (a + z 2 + b2 )2\n\nwhere a, b are positive constants.\nThe corresponding three-dimensional density derived from Eq.

(16), is\nM\n.\nf (R, z) = q\n\u221a\n2 R2 + (a + z 2 + b2 )2\n\n(21)\n\nAs we will see in next sections, the gravitational potential only can be approximated by f (R, z) in the Newtonian\nlimit. By now, the true gravitational potential will be calculated from the circular velocity of some test particle in\nthe system.\nIII.\n\nAPPROXIMATED ROTATION CURVES FROM CIRCULAR GEODESICS\n\nNow, the particles of such configuration describe trajectories that can be derived by calculating the system geodesic\nequations. Usually, when there are some stresses (and there are, both radial and azimuthal), the configuration can\nhardly be interpreted in terms of particles moving on circular geodesics. However, the assumption of geodesic motion\nis only valid for the case of a particle moving in a very diluted gas like the gas made of stars that models a galaxy\ndisk. Given this important statement, it is possible to obtain the tangential velocities of the disk particles (i.e. the\n\n\f5\napproximated planar rotation curves) from geodesic equations. Assuming \u1e58 = 0 and \u017c = 0 (the particles have no\nradial motion and for simplicity are confined in the surface z = 0), the metric (4) can be rewritten as\n(1 \u2212 f )2 2\n\u1e6b \u2212 (1 + f )4 R2 \u03c6 \u03072 \u2212 e\u2212k \u1e8b2 \u2212 ek \u1e8f 2 = 1\n(1 + f )2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u1e8bA = dxA /ds, which gives\n2\n\n\u1e6b =\n\n\u0012\n\n1+f\n1\u2212f\n\n\u00132\n\n[1 + (1 + f )4 R2 \u03c6 \u03072 + e\u2212k \u1e8b2 + ek \u1e8f 2 ].\n\n(23)\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations for x and y coordinates permit to calculate the following geodesic equations\n(e\u2212k \u1e8b)* = 0; e\u2212k \u1e8b = Cx ,\n\n(24)\n\n(ek \u1e8f)* = 0; ek \u1e8f = Cy ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere Cx and Cy are integration constants.

(8). In the case of constants Cx and Cy , the values coincides exactly with the same obtained in [11].\nIn the case of the constant k1 , it must be tiny (k1 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22127 ). The usual manner to determine parameters a\nand b (that are given in kpc) in Eq. (21) is to obtain them phenomenologically by observing values of density for the\ngalaxies, as done in [8].

(b) The variation of\nrotation curves for the range of stable models ploted in (a).\n\nand b can be rearranged in the new parameter b/a. Usually, disky galaxies have b/a \u223c 0.01. Observation of densities\nplus the stability study present a complete manner to construct a galaxy for a system modeled from gravitation with\nextra dimensions.\nV.\n\nPROBING THE MODEL WITH REAL GALAXIES\n\nAs showed in [8] one can model a real spiral galaxy by using a superposition of the central and outbound densities\nfor different values of a and b.PHere we will constrain as well the value of k as explained in the previous section.\nThis is the same P\nas write \u03c1 = i \u03c1(ai , bi ). In other words, this is the same to write the function f , Eq. (21), by the\nsuporposition of i f (ai , bi ). For the case of a spiral galaxy, say, it is suffice to write for the central bulge and for\nthe disk galaxy part. It is possible indeed to calculate the rotation curves for many galaxies (including not only the\nspiral morphology). As an example, the spiral galaxy NGC 3198 can be modeled. Considering the surface density\nobserved on the disk and the morphology characteristics [12] and assuming that the bulge density is not so different\nthan that observed for Milky Way [8] (where usually a is set to zero and b \u223c 1kpc; this means that b/a \u2192 \u221e, or a\ntotal spherical \u223c 1kpc central bulge), we obtain a set of stable rotation curves (see Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe potential presented at Eq. (19) \u2013 i.e. a Miyamoto-Nagai ansatz \u2013 is purely Newtonian and was useful to\ncalculate the form of the function f in the metric. Therefore it is necessary to calculate the true potential related to\nthe problem. We can translate the potential form by calculating the density by\n\n\u03c1=\n\n\u22072 \u03a6\n,\n4\u03c0\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the potential is reconstructed from the planar circular geodesics (27) by\n\u03a6=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nR\n\nVC2\ndR,\nR\n\n(39)\n\nwhere VC is given in Eq. (27). The density contour plots recovered from such equations is showed in Fig. 4, and our\nobject is very similar to a spiral galaxy.\nWe can compared such result with other potentials known in literature. In e.g. [15], it is listed some of possible\ngalaxy potentials. A first one, used here as well (Miyamoto-Nagai potential-density pair) is compared to the density\nrecovered from our circular velocities (see Fig. 5).\nAnother interesting potential to be compared is the Satoh's\n\u03a6\u221e\nM (R, z) = \u2212\n\nM\n,\nS\n\n(40)\n\n\f8\n3\n2\nz kpc\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\nR kpc\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFIG. 4: The GEDi density contour plots for NGC 3198.

The bit difference between the reconstructed\ndensity profile and conventional Newtonian 4D examples, shows that the extra dimensions affect remarkably the\ncircular velocity profile but, although affect poorly some absolute values when compared to other potentials (what\nindeed does not disagree remarkably with observations), the density contours point to an object very similar to a\nspiral galaxy.\nVI.\n\nROTATION CURVES ARE NOT FLAT!\n\nAn essential observational remark is that real galaxy rotation curves are not flat. Thus the flat rotation curve\nparadigm should be dismissed for every galaxy model. Here it is possible to show that when the parameter k1 is in\nthe superior limit of stable curves, i.e., k1 \u223c 10\u22125 , the curves become non-planar. It is showed in Fig. 7.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nHere we presented stable rotation curves of a configuration living in a 6D universe and the comparison with some\npotentials present in literature.

Parameters used: b/a = 0.01,\nCx = 0.2, Cy = 0.9 and k1 = 10\u22125 .\n\npotential for spiral galaxies our model was constructed and a Miyamoto-Nagai ansatz was used to solve Einstein\nequations. The stable rotation curves of such system were computed and, without fitting techniques, we recovered\nwith fidelity the observational data.\nThe present semi-phenomenological approach points to the evidence that a universe endowed with extra dimensions\ncould explain the \"missing mass\" problem without a dark matter particle, at least for the case of rotation curves\nof galaxies, following the same results obtained in [5]. As explained in [5] and also in [11], although there is no\nfundamental theory presented, Eqs. (23)\u2013(25) allow one to connect our model with some universal extra dimension\nlike theory [16], although here we relax about compactification.\nExtra dimensions arise here three main integration new constants (k1 , Cx and Cy ), that are used as parameters of\nthe model. The main goal is to find stable parameters using a geodesic perturbative approach. Thus we find that\nCx and Cy should range as the conventional thin disk calculation obtained in [11], and k1 is a very tiny parameter\nranging from 10\u22127 \u2212 10\u22125 . Miyamoto-Nagai configurations also introduce the parameter b/a and for disky galaxies\nwe should use b/a \u223c 0.01.\nFor the actual solution of k(R, z) we have one of the two extra dimensions becoming large and the other very small.\nIt is well known that the important part of the galaxy rotation curve for spirals (our case) occurs for 0 < R < 10Rd ,\nas can be seen in [15], and where Rd is the half luminosity radius of the disk. Thus with no loss of generality, in the\n\n\f10\nregion of interest we do k = k1 (z \u00b1 R). As explained in section IV, the stability of the model is guaranteed for k1 very\nsmall (here 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22127 for R calculated in kpc). When R > 10Rd we have only k greater than one when R \u223c 107\nkpc, a value as great as the radius of the universe. Thus the smallness of k1 guarantee a approximated asymptotically\nflat spacetime in scales of a galaxy.\nOur model also, inside the range where curves are stable, reproduces the behavior of non flat galaxy rotation curves.\nThe incredibly amount of theories that either imply or assume the existence of an observational scenario in which\nrotation curves of spirals are asymptotically flat, is clearly in contradiction with observational evidence. Thus, in this\naspect, the present model can explain both planar and non-planar rotation curves.\nHere obviously there is no claim to replace the dark matter paradigm since the usual models of dark matter have been\na relatively successful black box, fitting very well with many theoretical and observational issues: not only rotation\ncurves and lensing, but also N\u2013body numerical simulations, structure formation and the analysis of anisotropies of\nthe CMB. To replace this black box by another one is not a simple matter, and requires its testing in a wide scope of\ntheoretical and observational areas.\nAlso one can interpret the model as part os some theory of universal extra dimensions. The phenomenology\npresented has no pretension to rise aspects of some fundamental theory based on quantum fields. As we relaxed about\ncompactification and worked on some effects on large scales (i.e. galaxy scales), it is not in the scope of the present\npaper to argue about constraints from particle experiments.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are very grateful to I.T.

From now, (4+n) GAB and (4+n) TAB will be simply called GAB and TAB (the same for the\ncurvature tensor and scalar, and as well for the metric).\nThe most general metric for the space-time given above is\n\uf8f6\ng\u03b1\u03b2\n|\ng\u03b1b\ng(x\u03b1 ) = \uf8ed\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\uf8f8 ,\nga\u03b2\n|\ngab\n\uf8eb\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = (0, .., 3) and a, b = (4, .., n), for any integer n > 4, and we are considering the conventional treatment to\ndo the metric a function only of 3 + 1 coordinates. This metric, as written above, contains the explicit terms meaning\nthe 3 + 1 universe and also the n terms plus crossed components. In fact, Eq. (A3) can be as well rewritten, for\nconvenience, in a different way as\na \u03b2\n\u03b1 b\n\u03b1 \u03b2\na b\n\u03b4B + ga\u03b2 \u03b4A\n\u03b4B ,\ngAB = g\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4A\n\u03b4B + gab \u03b4A\n\u03b4B + g\u03b1b \u03b4A\n\n(A4)\n\nfor A, B = (0, .., 3 + n) and where \u03b4ji are the conventional Kronecker symbols.\nConsidering the particular case where the metric is diagonal, it is possible to find the derivatives and consequently\nthe curvature terms (see [9] for the explicit calculation). The equations of motion for such system are calculated as\n\u1e8d\u03bc +\n\nn\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\no\n\n\u1e8b\u03b1 \u1e8b\u03b2 =\n\n1\ngab,\u03b3 g \u03bc\u03b3 Nc g ac Nd g bd ,\n2\n\n(A5)\n\n\f11\nwhere Na means a vector that contains, e.g., the parameters Cx and Cy (for the case of 6D). The metric elements\nshould be calculated by a new Poisson equation (plus boundary conditions and initial values) that arises from the\nnew terms in Einstein equations. The Myiamoto-Nagai example in the present paper is a particular case for such\napproach. All the discussion about those terms are presented at [9].\nInside the disk galaxy, extra dimensions affect gravity from an effective potential calculated as\n\u03a6 = \u03c6 + C cosh(k + \u03b4),\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the potential that comes from 4D, C and \u03b4 are constants to be calculated and k is the function associated\nwith extra dimensions inside the metric.\n\n[1] J.
