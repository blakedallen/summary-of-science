The data have been anticipated\nbecause of the light they cast on the structure of the pion and nucleon.\nIn [1] the ZEUS Collaboration uses an effective flux method[2] to determine\nthe photon-pion total cross section at high W, and the deep inelastic structure\nfunction of the pion, F2\u03c0 (x, Q2 ) 1 . In this note, the method is described; its\nassumptions and inherent difficulties are discussed; and the problem of error is\nconfronted. Implications of the ZEUS data are examined critically for the role\nof meson exchange in the production of leading neutrons and for the structure\nof the pion.\nEmail address: levman@physics.utoronto.ca (Garry Levman).\nURL: http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~ levman (Garry Levman).\n1 The notation used follows [1]. W is a center of momentum frame energy. x is a\nBjorken scaling variable. Q2 is the virtuality of the exchanged photon.\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n23 October 2018\n\n\f2\n\nMeson Exchange Picture of Leading Baryon Production\n\nLeading baryons are those produced with small transverse momentum, pT ,\nand carrying a large fraction xL , of the incoming proton's energy. They are\nthought to represent the conserved baryon current because the squared 4momentum transfer, t, between the incoming proton and outgoing baryon is\nsmall([1], Fig. 1).\nThe production data for leading baryons can be understood in terms of meson\nexchanges. Consider the specific case \u03b3p \u2192 Xn. The cross section for the\nproduction of a leading neutron is given by a sum over all possible meson\nexchanges between the photon and proton which lead to an outgoing neutron\nat the proton vertex([1], Fig. 1):\n\u03c3\u03b3p\u2192Xn (xL , t, W 2) \u223c a\u03b3,p (t)\n\nX\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nfi/p (xL , t)\u03c3\u03b3i (1 \u2212 xL )W 2 , t\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere i = \u03c0, \u03c1, or a2 meson; \u03c3\u03b3i is the total \u03b3i cross section; fi/p is the\nsplitting function for p \u2192 n via i exchange; and a\u03b3,p is a form factor which\naccounts for rescattering of the neutron (absorption) due to the finite size\nof the projectile. Projectiles other than the photon, and produced baryons\nother than the neutron are treated similarly. For example, in the reaction\npp \u2192 Xp the \u03c9 and f2 mesons, and the pomeron IP also contribute. There are\ncomplications. The direct production of baryons which decay, such as \u2206 \u2192 n\u03c0,\nleads to the indirect production of nucleons; there can be two-meson exchange,\nand different exchanges can interfere; the form factor, a\u03b3,p , can depend on xL\nand perhaps on the exchanged meson i. The simple factorization assumed in\nEqn. 1 is only an approximation.\n\n3\n\nLeading Neutron Production and Pion Exchange\n\nIn hadro-production experiments (projectile=p, \u03c0) leading neutron production\nis believed to be dominated by pion exchange. The spectrum of leading neutrons in pp collisions at Fermilab and the ISR is fairly well represented by a\nsingle term (one-meson-exchange) of the form\n\u03c3pp\u2192Xn =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 g2\n\u22122t\n1\u22122t\n2\n(1\n\u2212\nx\n)\n\u03c3\n(1\n\u2212\nx\n)W\n,\nt\n=\n0\nL\n\u03c0p\nL\n4\u03c0 4\u03c0 (t \u2212 m2\u03c0 )2\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere m\u03c0 is the mass of the pion, g 2 /4\u03c0 = 14.5, and \u03c3\u03c0p is the measured,\non-mass-shell, \u03c0p total cross section. The splitting function\nfef f (xL , t) =\n\n1 g2\n\u22122t\n(1 \u2212 xL )1\u22122t\n4\u03c0 4\u03c0 (t \u2212 m2\u03c0 )2\n\n(3)\n\nis very close to that expected from pure one-pion exchange. The result is\nsimple, but surprising. Note in Eqn. 3 the absence of\n\u2022 an absorptive factor a(t);\n\u2022 an off-mass-shell correction, that is, a t dependence to \u03c3(\u03c0p);\n\u2022 contributions from \u03c1 and a2 exchange, and \u2206 production.\nThe self-consistency of the meson exchange picture requires the presence of\nsuch 'backgrounds'. In addition, the value, 14.5, of the p\u03c0 0 p coupling constant\nis larger than recent estimates[3,4] which suggest that g 2 /4\u03c0 lies in the range\n(13.5\u201314.1).\nThe ZEUS Collaboration has reviewed (see [1], \u00a710.1) the expected backgrounds to one-pion exchange which are known both from experimental measurements (eg. \u2206 production) and from theoretical calculations (eg. absorption). The effects are large, roughly 20-30%, apparently confounding the experimental observation embodied in Eqns. 2 and 3; however,\n\u2022 \u03c1, a2 exchange and \u2206 production increase neutron production, while absorptive effects decrease neutron production\n\u2022 absorption preferentially removes \u03c1 and a2 compared to \u03c0 exchange because\na(t) decreases with increasing t and the contribution of the higher mass\nmesons increases relative to the pion at high t.\nThe conclusion to draw is that simple one-pion exchange agrees well with the\nhadro-production data because of a fortuitous near cancellation of absorptive\neffects and background contributions. The large value of the effective coupling\nconstant (14.5) implies that the cancellation is not perfect, and that there\nis a residual . 5% contribution to the normalization. fef f is not the true\npion flux, but rather an effective pion flux in the presence of competing and\n'compensating' processes.\n\n4\n\nThe Effective Flux\n\nThe effective flux of pions in the proton (effective splitting function) can be\ndefined by experiment as the deconvolution of the measured semi-inclusive\n3\n\n\fdifferential cross section for pp \u2192 Xn and the measured \u03c0p total cross section,\nfef f (xL , t) \u2261\n\nd\u03c3pp\u2192Xn\n/\u03c3\u03c0p\ndxL dt\n\n(4)\n\nwhere deconvolution is written as division. By construction and definition\nfef f corrects one-pion exchange in pp collisions for \u03c1 and a2 exchange, \u2206\nproduction, rescattering and off-mass-shell effects, etc. From Eqn. 1 it is seen\nthat a 'model' for fef f is\nfef f \u223c ap,p (t)\n\nX\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nfi/p (xL , t)\u03c3ip (1 \u2212 xL )W 2 , t /\u03c3\u03c0p (1 \u2212 xL )W 2 , t = 0\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\nIt is important to emphasize: experiments find that a convenient parameterization of fef f is given by Eqn. 3. Because of the universal behavior of hadronic\ncross sections fef f is also expected to work for \u03c0p and \u03b3p collisions.\n\n5\n\nThe Structure of the Pion and the Effective Flux\n\nIt has been proposed[8,9] to measure the structure function of the pion F2\u03c0\nat HERA using virtual \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 collisions assuming pion exchange dominates the\ninteraction \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 Xn, just as it does in hadro-production.\nA vital consistency check for any extraction of F2\u03c0 using the electro-production\nof leading neutrons is the demonstration that the photo-production of leading\nneutrons is in accord with the hadro-production measurements. The importance of the photo-production data arises because:\n\u2022 W is the single relevant leptonic variable (Q2 = 0).\n\u2022 the W dependence of measured hadronic cross sections closely follows a\nsimple universal behavior; at high W the hadronic total cross sections behave as a power law W 2(\u03b1IP \u22121) , where \u03b1IP is a constant independent of the\nprojectile and target.\n\u2022 the photo-production (Q2 < 0.02 GeV2 ) and transition region (0.1 < Q2 <\n0.74 GeV2 ) data from HERA are in good agreement with vector dominance\nin which the photon behaves like an exchanged vector meson and the collision is hadronic[7,10].\nIn contrast to photo-production, the situation in electro-production is less well\nunderstood. The additional degree of freedom quantified by Q2 adds complication. Rescattering, background composition and levels, and factorization\nproperties can vary with Q2 . Moreover, in deep inelastic scattering (Q2 & 4\nGeV2 ) the chief interest lies in measuring the W (that is x, x \u2248 Q2 /W 2 at low\n4\n\n\fx) dependence of the cross section. In summary, a prerequisite for a believable determination of F2\u03c0 using high Q2 electro-production data is a consistent\ndetermination of \u03c3\u03b3\u03c0 using photo-production data.\nA standard technique for determining \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) involves fitting the observed differential cross section for \u03b3p \u2192 Xn while simultaneously correcting for background exchanges, Delta production, absorption, and off-mass-shell effects[11].\nThis procedure has the important advantage of providing an estimate of the\nsize of the contributing sub-processes and giving a transparent estimate of the\nerror. It has the disadvantage that there is a large number of effects to be\naccounted for, with a corresponding large degree of freedom. The parameters\nmust be guessed, fit, or fixed by experiment.\nThe effective flux is used instead to directly determine \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) without determining the individual sub-processes. This has the advantages of simplicity\nand directness, but the disadvantage that no information is obtained about\nthe relative importance of the various processes which contribute. The error\nis difficult to estimate (see \u00a76) because the amount of pion exchange present\nis not unambiguously determined. If pion exchange does not contribute, the\nresult, although well defined, is meaningless.\nThe arguments which follow (in \u00a75.1 and \u00a75.2) give the essence of what obtains\nfrom the ZEUS measurement.\n\n5.1 \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) at high W\n\nThe \u03b3\u03c0 total cross section is obtained from the photo-production data using\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) =\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 Xn)/dxL\nfef f\n\nwhere the variable t has been integrated out in the numerator. Substitution\nfor fef f from its definition in Eqn. 4 shows that \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) can be determined from\n(double) ratios\nd\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 Xn)/dxL\n\u03c3(\u03c0p)\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0)\n\u03c3(\u03b3p)\n*\n=\nd\u03c3(pp \u2192 Xn)/dxL \u03c3(pp)\n\u03c3(\u03b3p)\n\u03c3(pp)\nof measured quantities.\n5\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe ZEUS Collaboration has observed that the relative rate of neutron production in photo-production at HERA is half that of pp collisions. It follows\nfrom Eqn. 5 that \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0)/\u03c3(\u03b3p) is half \u03c3(\u03c0p)/\u03c3(pp). Therefore, as ZEUS deduces directly,\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) \u2243 \u03c3(\u03b3p)/3\nrather than two-thirds as expected from Regge factorization or the counting\nof valence quarks (the Additive Quark Model).\nAn important consistency check, which the ZEUS Collaboration has performed\n([1], Fig. 6 & 8), is that the neutron energy and angular distributions are\ndescribed by fef f .\n5.2 F2\u03c0 at low x\nThe double ratio (Eqn. 5) is robust for hadro- and photo-production; however,\nfor electro-production, absorptive rescattering decreases as Q2 increases, as\ndiscussed in [5] and [6] (see also [1], Fig. 9). At low Q2 (Q2 . 1 GeV2 ), F2\u03c0\nand \u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0) are related by\nF2\u03c0 \u2243\n\nQ2\n\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0)\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nwhich, in analogy with \u03c1 dominance in \u03b3p interactions[7], can be written as\nF2\u03c0 \u2243\n\nm2\u03c1\nQ2\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0)\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1 m2\u03c1 + Q2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere m\u03c1 is the mass of the \u03c1 meson.\nEquations 6 and 7 connect the photo-production \u03b3\u03c0 cross section to the transition region \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 cross section; together with the corresponding equations for\n\u03b3 (\u2217) p interactions,\n\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p)\n\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0)\n\u2243\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0)\n\u03c3(\u03b3p)\n\n(8)\n\nobtains. In the kinematic region 0 < Q2 < 4 GeV2 the ratio of neutron production (i.e. tagged divided by all) increases. To maintain Eqn. 8 an absorptive correction needs to be applied. Rescattering decreases, and the effective\nflux must increase correspondingly in order to maintain consistency between\n6\n\n\fphoto-production, the transition region, and deep inelastic scattering. The\nDIS\nZEUS data require for deep inelastic scattering (DIS) fef f \u2192 fef\nf = 1.3fef f .\nThe measurements show that 2.5% of deep inelastic scattering events, independent of x and Q2 , have a leading neutron with 0.64 < xL < 0.82\nand pT < 0.66xL GeV ([1], Fig. 10). The constancy of the ratio of neutron production in DIS as a function of x and Q2 implies that F2\u03c0 (x, Q2 ) =\nkF2p ((1 \u2212 xL )x, Q2 ) = kF2p (0.27x, Q2 ) with a constant of proportionality k\ngiven by\nk=RR\n\n0.025\nDIS\nfef\nf (xL , t)dxL dt\n\n= 0.25\n\nwhere the integration is over the xL and t(pT ) range covered by the ZEUS\nmeasurement. Because F2p (x) \u221d (1/x)\u03bb with \u03bb \u2248 0.2[7]\nF2\u03c0 (x, Q2 ) \u2248 F2p (x, Q2 )/3\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nFor the determination of F2\u03c0 the effective flux method requires little theoretical\ninput. Only the general concepts of meson exchange theory are needed. The\ndata, hadro-production, photo-production and electro-production, determine\neverything. Note especially that\n\u2022 one-pion-exchange is not assumed. It is only assumed that pion exchange\ndominates neutron production.\n\u2022 the contribution of backgrounds is not neglected. The method accounts for \u03c1\nand a2 exchange and for indirect neutron production through \u2206 production\nand decay.\n\u2022 the exact composition and relative contribution of the backgrounds is unimportant.\n\u2022 absorptive effects are measured.\n\u2022 the consistency of the photo-production (Q2 < 0.02 GeV2 ), transition region\n(0.1 < Q2 < 0.74 GeV2 ), and DIS (Q2 > 4 GeV2 ) analyses requires and\ndefines an absorptive correction.\nIf absorption approximately compensates for background exchanges in hadroand photo-production, as the data suggest, then the 30% rise in neutron ratio\nbetween photo-production and DIS is a measure of the relative contribution\nof the backgrounds.\n7\n\n\fThe effective flux gives a normalization of \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) which differs by a factor\nof two from that expected by Regge factorization or valence quark counting.\nThe disagreement follows directly from the experimental observation that the\nrelative rate of neutrons in photo-production is half that observed in hadroproduction. Can fef f , which is determined by pp collisions, be wrong by a\nfactor of two when used for photo-production?\nBackground exchanges and absorptive effects are of the same magnitude, but\ncontribute with opposite signs. The ZEUS leading neutron data show that\nthe relative size of absorptive effects is approximately 20-30%. Background\nprocesses must contribute at approximately this level, in agreement with estimates from phenomenological studies (reviewed in[1], \u00a710.1). With this in\nmind, a conservative estimate for the error on using fef f for photo-production\nis obtained by assuming that pion exchange contributes & 50% and that the\nbackgrounds change by . 50% on moving from pp to \u03b3p collisions. The change\nin fef f is then . 25%. Suppose that the low neutron rate is not due to a small\nphoton-pion cross section, but rather due to changes in absorption or backgrounds. Then absorption must increase or backgrounds decrease strongly in\nthe photon-proton system compared to the proton-proton system.\nIf the meson exchange picture underestimates the normalization of \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) by a\nfactor of two, the theory is wrong, misapplied, or there is a significant missing\ningredient. Then one cannot extract with any confidence the x and Q2 behavior\nof F2\u03c0 .\nIf the photo-production result is disbelieved, the ZEUS data can be taken as\nevidence that meson exchange plays little role in the production of leading\nnucleons at HERA. One then argues that the ZEUS measurement is merely\na reflection of F2p , arising because of factorization (limiting fragmentation) at\nthe proton vertex and baryon conservation.\nOn the other hand, the experimental evidence for the meson exchange picture\nis good (see references in [1]). One can accept the picture and the normalization\nof \u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0) and F2\u03c0 implied by the ZEUS data. In this case some conjectures can\nbe make:\n\u2022 the x dependence of F2 for all hadrons is similar at low x and is determined mainly by the QCD evolution equations, only weakly by the valence\nstructure of the hadron.\n\u2022 the number of partons at low x in the pion is 1/3 that of the proton; since\nthe charged radius of the pion is 2/3 the proton's, the volume density of\npartons in the pion is approximately the same as in the proton.\n\u2022 there is a large probability for the proton to be found in a meson-nucleon\nor meson-Delta Fock state (the nucleon within the nucleon); the proton is a\nloosely bound meson-nucleon system composed of infinitely bound partons.\n8\n\n\f\u2022 the quark-antiquark sea of a hadron is generated mainly by valence-valence\ninteractions (three for the proton and one for the pion), and not by self\ninteractions.\nMoreover, there is a significant violation of the quark counting rules and Regge\nfactorization.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the context of the meson exchange picture of leading baryon production, the\nleading neutron data from ZEUS, taken together with the hadro-production\ndata from Fermilab and the ISR, make a statement about the normalization of\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u03c0). With the assumption that the x and Q2 dependence of the difference\nbetween pion exchange and the backgrounds is weak, F2\u03c0 can be extracted\nfrom the data. The normalization is the firmer of the determinations. If the\nnormalization fixed by the photo-production data is incorrect, then an extraction of F2\u03c0 is doubtful since the self-consistency of the picture is questionable.\nIn particular, the x and Q2 dependence extracted from the data is questionable because the high Q2 region is less well understood than photo-production,\nboth experimentally and phenomenologically.\nIf the determination of F2\u03c0 using the effective flux method is correct, then the\nZEUS data have important implications for the structure of the nucleon and\nthe pion.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank the ZEUS Collaboration for many useful discussions and for its efforts\nin publishing the inclusive leading neutron data.
