The SLE will provide a unified theory of statistics of random curves\nin the plane, which covers (continuum limits of) random interfaces characterizing surface\ncritical phenomena in equilibrium (e.g. the percolation exploration process, the critical Ising\ninterface), models of random chains in polymer physics (e.g. the self-avoiding walks), fractal\npatterns playing important roles in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models (e.g. the\nloop-erased random walks and the uniform spanning trees for sandpile models and forest\nfire models showing self-organized criticality), and so on [4\u20136]. The theory is based on two\nbranches of mathematics, the complex function theory [7] and the stochastic analysis [2, 3]\nand is strongly connected with the conformal field theory [8\u201310].\nAs well as by wideness of applications and by richness of mathematics, we are attracted\nby simple setting of the theory ; Consider a complex plane C. (i) First we consider a motion\nof Brownian particle on the real axis R. We assume that it starts from the origin 0 at time\nt = 0 and the diffusion constant is given by \u03ba > 0. If we write the position of the diffusion\nparticle on R at time t \u2265 0 as Ut , then hUt i = 0 and hUt2 i = \u03bat for t \u2265 0. Usually we\ndenote the position of a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion (BM) at time t by Bt ,\nfor which hBt i \u2261 B0 = 0, hBt2 i = t, t \u2265 0. The BM has the scaling property such that for\nany constant c > 0, the distribution of the position of BM at time c2 t is equal to that of the\n\nposition of BM at time t multiplied by a factor c, that is, the equality Bc2 t = cBt holds in\ndistribution. Then we can give the above Ut by\nUt =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03baBt ,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(1)\n\n(ii) Then we solve the following partial differential equation for a complex function ft (z) on\nthe upper half complex-plane H = {z \u2208 C : Im z > 0},\n\n\u2202ft (z) 2\n\u2202ft (z)\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202z z \u2212 Ut\n\n(2)\n\nunder the initial condition f0 (z) = z. (iii) Note that the boundary of H consists of the real\naxis R and an infinity point. When z \u2208 H approaches the special point Ut on R, the position\nof the BM, the RHS of (2) diverges. If we trace the image of this singular point\n\u03b3t = ft (Ut ),\n2\n\nt\u22650\n\n(3)\n\n\fwe will have a curve \u03b3(0, t] \u2261 {\u03b3s : 0 < s \u2264 t} in H starting from the origin. For each s > 0\nthe curve \u03b3(0, s] and the region enclosed by parts of the curve and the real axis R should be\neliminated from H in order to continue to solve Eq.(2) for t > s.\nFor any deterministic simple curve \u03b3(0, t] in H, t \u2265 0, Loewner proved that there exists a\nreal-valued function Ut and a conformal map ft , which is one-to-one from H to H \\ \u03b3(0, t] \u2261\n{z \u2208 H : z 6= \u03b3s , 0 < s \u2264 t}, the upper half complex-plane with a slit \u03b3(0, t], such that ft\nand Ut solve Eq.(2) with the condition (3). The equation (2) is called the Loewner equation\n[7, 11]. Schramm considered an inverse problem: given Ut on R and derive a curve \u03b3(0, t] by\nsolving Eq.(2). Since he gave Ut by a BM as Eq.(1), \u03b3t given by Eq.(3) performs a stochastic\nmotion and the obtained curve \u03b3(0, t] is statistically distributed in H [1]. Equation (2)\ndriven by a BM with variance \u03bat is called the stochastic Loewner equation or the SchrammLoewner evolution (SLE) [12], and a random curve \u03b3(0, t], t \u2265 0 is called the SLE curve with\nparameter \u03ba (the SLE\u03ba curve).\nAlthough the change of diffusion constant \u03ba causes only quantitative change of the driving\n\u221a\nfunction Ut , that is, scale/time change \u03baBt = B\u03bat in distribution, it does qualitative change\nof SLE\u03ba curves. When 0 < \u03ba \u2264 4, the curve is simple (with no self-intersection) with\n\u03b3(0, \u221e) \u2282 H. When 4 < \u03ba < 8, the curve is self-intersecting and \u03b3(0, \u221e) hits the real axis\nR infinitely many times, but it is not dense on H : \u03b3(0, \u221e) \u2229 H 6= H with limt\u2192\u221e |\u03b3t | = \u221e.\nAnd when \u03ba \u2265 8, it will cover whole of H in t \u2192 \u221e [2, 3]. The fractal dimension (Hausdorff\ndimension) of the SLE\u03ba curve is determined as [13, 14]\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 + \u03ba/8, 0 < \u03ba < 8\nd\u03ba =\n\uf8f3 2,\n\u03ba \u2265 8.\n\n(4)\n\nMoreover, if \u03ba is chosen to be a special value, SLE\u03ba curves provide the statistical ensembles of\ncontinuous limits of random discrete paths studied in statistical mechanics models exhibiting\ncritical phenomena or in fractal models on lattices. For example, the value \u03ba = 6 is for the\ncritical percolation model [15, 16]. Effective methods for numerical simulations of SLE\u03ba\ncurves by computers have been reported [17\u201319].\nToday we can learn from mathematics literatures that the Loewner equation (2) for a\ndeterministic function Ut had played important roles in the complex function theory even\nbefore Schramm introduced its stochastic version [7]. We shall say, however, that this\nequation has not been familiar to us, physicists. More familiar differential equation to us in\n3\n\n\fthe complex calculus is the one, whose solution gives a conformal transformation from H to\nthe interior of a polygon on the complex plane with mapping the real axis R to a piecewise\nlinear boundary of the polygon, called the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation (SCT) (see,\nfor example, [20]). So here we try to discuss the Loewner equation (2) by using a special\ncase of SCT.\n\nFIG. 1: SCT generating a straight slit in H\n\nLet 0 < \u03b1 < 1. Consider a conformal map f from H to the upper half complex-plane\nwith a straight slit starting from the origin, H \\ {a slit}, where the angle between the slit\nand the positive direction of the real axis is \u03b1\u03c0 as shown in Fig.1. Since H with the straight\nslit can be regarded as a polygon with the interior angles (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c0 on the left side of the\norigin, 2\u03c0 around the tip of the slit, and \u03b1\u03c0 on the right side of the origin, for any length of\na slit, the conformal map is given as an SCT, which solves the differential equation\ndf (z)\n= b1 (z + xL )\u2212\u03b1 (z \u2212 x0 )(z \u2212 xR )\u03b1\u22121 ,\ndz\n\n(5)\n\nwhere b1 is a complex number and xL , x0 , xR are real numbers satisfying the inequalities,\nxL > 0, xR > 0, \u2212xL < x0 < xR . By this transformation, both of the points \u2212xL and xR on\nR are mapped to the origin, f (\u2212xL ) = f (xR ) = 0, and x0 to the tip of the slit. See Fig.1.\nWe have found the general solution of (5) expressed by\nf (z) = b0 + b1 (z + xL )1\u2212\u03b1 (z \u2212 xR )\u03b1\n\u001a\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nx0 \u2212 xR + \u03b1(xL + xR ) \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nxL + z\n\u00d7 1+\n,\n(6)\nF 1, 1, 2 \u2212 \u03b1; L\nxL + xR\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03b1)\nx + xR\nR\u221e\nwhere b0 is a complex number, \u0393(z) = 0 e\u2212u uz\u22121 du (the gamma function), and F (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3; z)\nP\nis Gauss's hypergeometric function F (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3; z) = \u0393(\u03b3)/{\u0393(\u03b1)\u0393(\u03b2)} \u221e\nn=0 \u0393(\u03b1 + n)\u0393(\u03b2 +\nn)z n /{\u0393(\u03b3 + n)n!}. We impose the hydrodynamic condition\nf (z)\n\u2192 1 in z \u2192 \u221e.\nz\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fThen b0 = 0, b1 = 1 and x0 \u2212 xR + \u03b1(xL + xR ) = 0, and we have f (z) = (z + xL )1\u2212\u03b1 (z \u2212 xR )\u03b1 .\nEq.(5) is rewritten in this case as\ndf (z) 2\n2f (z)\n=\n.\n0\ndz z \u2212 x\n(z + xL )(z \u2212 xR )\n\n(8)\n\nWe then introduce a parameter \"time\" t \u2265 0 and assume that xL and xR , and thus also x0 ,\ndepend on t by setting\n\u03b1\nft (z) = (z + xLt )1\u2212\u03b1 (z \u2212 xR\nt ) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe differential of ft with respect to t is written as\n\u2202ft (z)\n2A(z, t)ft (z)\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n(z + xLt )(z \u2212 xR\nt )\nL\nL\nR\nL\n\u03b2\nR\n\u03b2\nwith A(z, t) = [\u2212(1\u2212\u03b1)(z \u2212xR\nt )dxt /dt+\u03b1(z +xt )dxt /dt]/2. Let xt = 2ct , xt = 2t /c with\np\nconstants c > 0 and \u03b2. Then we can see that, if and only if c = \u03b1/(1 \u2212 \u03b1) and \u03b2 = 1/2,\n\nA(z, t) becomes independent both of z and t; A(z, t) \u2261 1. Combining this observation with\nEq.(8) gives the following result: For 0 < \u03b1 < 1, the SCT\n!\u03b1\nr\nr\n\u00131\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1\nt\nz\u22122\nt\nft\u03b1 (z) = z + 2\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(10)\n\nis not only a solution of the Schwarz-Christoffel differential equation (5), but also of the\nLoewner equation (2) with the driving function\n\nwhere\n\n\u2212 \u03b1(xLt + xR\nUt\u03b1 = x0t = xR\nt )\n\uf8f1\u221a t\n\uf8f2 \u03ba\u03b1 t\nif \u03b1 \u2264 1/2\n=\n\u221a\n\uf8f3 \u2212 \u03ba\u03b1 t if \u03b1 > 1/2,\n\u03ba\u03b1 =\n\n4(1 \u2212 2\u03b1)2\n.\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nAs time t goes, the straight slit performs as an \"evolutionary boundary\" of the image of H\nby ft , in which the tip of the slit (3) is evolving as\n\u03b3t\u03b1 = ft\u03b1 (Ut\u03b1 )\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\u2212\u03b1\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b1\n= 2\nei\u03b1\u03c0 t,\n\u03b1\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(13)\n\nOne can observe the equality\nUt\u03b1\n\nq \u221a\n= \u00b1 h( \u03ba\u03b1 Bt )2 i,\n5\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(14)\n\n\fsince hBt2 i = t. That is, the driving function Ut\u03b1 for the above SCT (11) is the positive or\nthe negative root square of the squared average of the random driving function (1) of the\nSLE. So if we are able to introduce fluctuations into the SCT systematically, we can draw\napproximations of SLE curves on H. It may be the basic idea to simulate SLE curves by\ndividing a time period (0, t] into n small intervals {(tj\u22121, tj ] : j = 1, 2, . . . , n} by setting\n0 = t0 < t1 < * * * < tn = t and the above single SCT is replaced by an n-multiplicative map\nof infinitesimal SCTs with sufficiently large n [17, 18].\nOn the other hand, we know the fact that the diffusion property of BM can be observed\nin long-time asymptotic behavior of a simple discrete-time stochastic process, random walk\n(RW). Let \u03c3j , j = 1, 2, 3, . . . be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables taking values \u03c3j = 1 with probability 1/2 and \u03c3j = \u22121 with probability 1/2. Consider\na simple symmetric RW on the one-dimensional lattice Z = {. . . , \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, . . . } starting from the origin 0 at time n = 0. We denote the position of the random walker at time\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . by wn . Then, w0 = 0 and\nwn =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c3j ,\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\n(15)\n\nj=1\n\nIn the present paper, we consider an SCT as a functional of a random variable \u03c3 and consider\nan Iterative system of SCTs (ISCTs) driven by RW. By this system, each time series of steps\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . ) of RW is mapped to a series of points (\u03be1, \u03be2 , . . . ) in H. Let Wn and \u039en , n \u2265 0\nbe the interpolations by straight lines of wn and \u03ben , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , respectively. Since for\n\u221a\nT > 0, {WN t / N : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T } converges to {Bt : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T } as N \u2192 \u221e in distribution,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u039eN t\nN\n(16)\n\u03b6 (0, T ] = \u221a , 0 < t \u2264 T , T > 0,\nN\nwhich we call the rescaled ISCT path with N up to time T , will converge to an SLE curve\nup to time T , \u03b3(0, T ], in distribution as N \u2192 \u221e.

They seems to approximate the\nSLE\u03ba curves \u03b3(0, 1] very well. In the present paper, we will show that, for sufficiently large\nN, \u03b6tN has the same statistical properties as the SLE curve \u03b3t has.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we define the ISCT driven by random walk\nwith a parameter \u03ba = \u03ba\u03b1 defined by (12) and the ISCT\u03ba paths. In Sec.III, by observing\nthe behavior of ISCT paths \u039e(0, n] for small values of n, we show that, even if we use the\n6\n\n\fFIG. 2: Approximations of the SLE\u03ba curves up to time T = 1 expressed by the ISCT\u03ba paths for\n\u03ba = 2 and \u03ba = 6.\n\nsame realization of RW as a driving function, the ISCT\u03ba paths with large values of \u03ba exhibit\nmuch more complicated motion on H than those with smaller values of \u03ba. In Sec.IV, we\nreport the properties of the rescaled ISCT paths \u03b6 N (0, T ] with T = 1 based on large scaled\ncomputer simulations with N \u2243 104 \u223c 105 . We evaluate the fractal dimensions d\u03baISCT of\nthe N \u2192 \u221e limits of \u03b6 N (0, 1] for several values of \u03ba, and the dependence of d\u03baISCT on \u03ba\n\nis compared with that of the fractal dimensions d\u03ba of the SLE curves given by (4). We\nalso show that, for 4 < \u03ba < 8, the generalized version of Cardy's formula of SLE\u03ba curves\n[2, 21] will be applicable to the rescaled ISCT\u03ba paths \u03b6 N (0, T ], if N and T are sufficiently\nlarge. Section V is devoted to give concluding remarks. Appendix A is prepared for giving\nrecurrence relations, which will be useful to analyze the ISCT paths.\n\n7\n\n\fII.\n\nISCT DRIVEN BY RW\n\np\nNoting that Eq.(12) is solved for \u03b1 as \u03b1 = [1 \u00b1 \u03ba/(\u03ba + 16)]/2, we set\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03ba\n1\n\u03ba\n1\u2212\u03c3\n\u03b1 (\u03c3) =\n2\n\u03ba + 16\n\n(17)\n\nfor \u03ba > 0, \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, 1}, and define the SCT as a functional of a random variable \u03c3 by\n\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\nF\u03c3\u03ba (z) \u2261 f1\n=\n\n(z)\ns\n\nz+2\n\n\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n1\u2212\n\n\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\n!1\u2212\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\nz\u22122\n\ns\n\n\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\n1\u2212\n\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\n!\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c3)\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nGiven one step \u03c31 of RW on Z, we consider an SCT, F\u03c3\u03ba1 (z), which is a conformal map\nfrom H to the region H with a straight slit. The straight slit starts from the origin and ends\nat the tip located at\n\u221a\n\u03be1 = F\u03c3\u03ba1 ( \u03ba\u03c31 )\n\u00131/2\u2212\u03b1\u03ba (\u03c31 )\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03ba (\u03c31 )\n\u03ba\nei\u03b1 (\u03c31 )\u03c0 .\n= 2\n\u03ba\n\u03b1 (\u03c31 )\n\n(19)\n\nNext assume that two steps of RW, (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ), is given. We transform H by an SCT, F\u03c3\u03ba2 . The\nimage of H, F\u03c3\u03ba2 (H), is the region H with the straight slit, which starts from the origin and\n\u221a\n(1)\nends at \u03be2 \u2261 F\u03c3\u03ba2 ( \u03ba\u03c32 ). Then we consider the transformation of the region H with this\nstraight slit by another SCT, F\u03c3\u03ba1 . By this SCT, a straight slit from the origin to the point\n\n\u03be1 is generated as shown by (19). The image by F\u03c3\u03ba1 of the straight slit between the origin\n(1)\n\nand \u03be2\n\nin H is, however, no longer a straight line but a curvy one. It starts from \u03be1 and\n\nends at\n\u221a\n(1)\n\u03be2 = F\u03c3\u03ba1 ( \u03ba\u03c31 + \u03be2 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= F\u03c3\u03ba1 ( \u03ba\u03c31 + F\u03c3\u03ba2 ( \u03ba\u03c32 )).\n\n(20)\n\nWe have then a set of two points (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) in H. Set n \u2265 1 and now we assume that a realization\nof RW on Z up to time n is specified by the series of n steps, \u03c3(n) = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3n ). Let\n\u221a\nS\u03c3\u03ba (z) = F\u03c3\u03ba ( \u03ba\u03c3 + z)\n\n(21)\n\nfor \u03ba > 0, \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, 1} and z \u2208 H.

See Fig. 3. In the present paper we call S\u03c3\n(n) (z) the iterative Schwarz-Christoffel\ntransformation (ISCT for short) driven by RW specified by \u03c3(n) = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ).\n\nFIG. 3: Iteration of SCTs\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , we define the points in H by\n\u03ba\n\u03ben = S\u03c3\n(n) (0).\n\n(23)\n\nWe set \u03be0 \u2261 0. The sequence of points (\u03be0 , \u03be1 , \u03be2, . . . , \u03ben ) is interpolated by straight lines.\nWe call it an ISCT path in H and denote it by \u039e(0, n]. In other words, each realization \u03c3(n)\nof RW on Z is mapped to a path \u039e(0, n] on H by the ISCT.\nFor a given n \u2265 1, we introduce the following recurrence relations for a series\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(n)\n\n(\u03ben , \u03ben , . . . , \u03ben ),\n\u03ben(k+1) = S\u03c3\u03ban\u2212k (\u03ben(k) ),\n(0)\n\nwith \u03ben\n\nk = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1\n\n(24)\n\n= 0.

We can see that the ISCT path with \u03ba = 8 is much\nmore complicated than the path with \u03ba = 2. As shown by Fig.5 and Fig.6, the network\nNn\u03ba is bounded by the rightmost path \u039emax (0, n] generated by \u03c3 max (n) = (1, 1, . . . , 1) and\nthe leftmost path \u039emin (0, n] generated by \u03c3 min (n) = (\u22121, \u22121, . . . , \u22121).

As shown by this figure, the data for any \u03ba can\nbe fitted by a straight line very well and we can evaluate the approximate values of fractal\ndimensions for finite N.\n\nFIG. 7: Log-log plot of the box-counting data for the restricted ISCT paths for \u03ba = 4.\n\nThe evaluated values up to at most N = 3 \u00d7 105 are then plotted versus 1/N in Fig.8.\nFor each evaluation we prepared M = 20 samples, and the ranges of scattering of results are\nshown by error bars in the figure.

The obtained values a0 by the extrapolation are denoted\nby d\u03baISCT .\nFigure 9 shows dependence of d\u03baISCT on \u03ba. The Hausdorff dimensions of the SLE\u03ba curves\ngiven by (4) are also shown by a dotted line. Systematic deviation is found between d\u03ba for\nthe SLE curves and d\u03baISCT numerically evaluated for the rescaled ISCT paths. We observe\nin Fig.8 that the approximate value of fractal dimension for finite N is increasing as N\nis increasing, and the ratio of increment becomes larger as \u03ba approaches the value 8. So\nwe expect that the deviation will be systematically reduced, if we can perform numerical\nsimulation for larger N's and make appropriate extrapolation to the N \u2192 \u221e limit.\n\n14\n\n\fFIG. 8: Extrapolation of fractal dimensions in the N \u2192 \u221e limit.\n\nFIG. 9: Dependence of the fractal dimensions d\u03baISCT of rescaled ISCT paths is shown.

Note that, if\n\u03ba \u2264 4, t\u2217 (x) = \u221e, and if \u03ba \u2265 8, \u03b3t\u2217 (x) = x, with probability one. For (32), \u03b3t\u2217 (x) has a\nnontrivial distribution.

For integers N and T with N \u226b 1, prepare a realization\nof RW represented by \u03c3(NT ) = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3N T ). For each n = 1, 2, . . . , NT , by using the\ndata (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3n ), we calculate the position \u03ben in H following the recurrence formula (24).\nAs noted at the end of Sec.III, Im \u03ben > 0 for any n \u2265 1.

Since T = 1, we are allowed to consider\nonly small values of x and \u03b5. The threshold value h is wanted to be small, but for finiteness\nof N, it should be positive. In Fig.11, we show log-log plots of the numerical evaluations of\nP(Re \u03b6tNh (x) < x + \u03b5, th (x) \u2264 1) for \u03ba = 5 with x = 0.8, h = 0.1, \u03ba = 6 with x = 0.5, h = 0.1,\nand \u03ba = 7 with x = 0.8, h = 0.2. For finiteness of N and smallness of the number of samples\nM, data scatter for small \u03b5. We find, however, power-law behaviors in the intermediate\nregions of \u03b5;\nP(\u03b6t\u2217 (x) < x + \u03b5) \u2243 \u03b5\u03b4 .\n\n(40)\n\nBy linear fitting as shown in Fig.11, we have evaluated the values of exponent \u03b4. The results\nare plotted in Fig.12, where Eq.(36) derived from the generalized Cardy's formula is also\n17\n\n\fshown by a curve. The good agreement implies that in the proper limit (39) will also follow\nthe generalized Cardy's formula in the parameter region (32).\n\nFIG. 12: Numerical evaluations of the exponent \u03b4 in the power law (40) for \u03ba = 5, 6, and 7.

The system has one parameter \u03ba > 0\nand we call the path an ISCT\u03ba path. We have studied the rescaled ISCT\u03ba path defined by\n\u221a\n\u03b6 N (0, T ] = \u039e(0, NT ]/ N for large N by computer simulations. The numerical analysis of\nthe distributions of \u03b6 N (0, T ] supports our expectation that the limits of the rescaled ISCT\u03ba\npaths \u03b6(0, \u221e) = limT \u2192\u221e limN \u2192\u221e \u03b6 N (0, T ] will have the same statistical properties as the\nSLE\u03ba curves have.\nThe rescaled ISCT\u03ba paths \u03b6 N (0, T ] can be regarded as discrete approximations of the\nSLE\u03ba curves. In this sense, the present study could be included by the previous numerical\nwork [17, 18]. In this paper, however, we have emphasized on our interest in the ISCT itself as\na simple algorithm to generate complicated discrete dynamics of a point on H. Dependence\non the parameter \u03ba of complexity of the SLE curves is demonstrated by dependence of\ncomplexity of the network Nn\u03ba of the ISCT paths on the angle \u03b1\u03c0 of the slit generated by a\nsingle SCT.\n18\n\n\fWe have learned that stochastic analysis is necessary and useful to study statistics and\nstochastics of the SLE\u03ba curves [2, 3]. Although we have reported only numerical study in\nthis paper, we hope that the combinatorics and statistical mechanics methods developed for\nsolvable models on lattices will be useful to analyze statistics and stochastics of the ISCT\u03ba\npaths on H, since they are functionals of simple random walks in one dimension.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe present authors would like to thank M.
