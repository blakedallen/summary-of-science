The addition of a third\naspheric mirror to construct telescope optics enables the removal of remaining major aberrations\n(Paul 1935; Robb 1978; Yamashita, Nariai 1983; Epps 1983; Schroeder 1987; Wilson 1996). For\ninstance, Willstrop (1984) designed a wide-field telescope with three aspheric mirrors, giving\n4\u25e6 field of view with an image size better than 0.\u2032\u2032 31, or a 3\u25e6 field of view with a flat focal plane\n(Willstrop 1985). Rakich and Rumsey (2002) as well as Rakich (2002) found solutions for a flatfield three-mirror telescope with only one mirror aspherized. However, many of the three-mirror\ntelescope designs suffer from obscurations, except for the design reported by Korsch (1980) for\npractical applications. A four-mirror telescope with spherical primary is another approach to\n1\n\n\fachieve small obstruction (Meinel et al. 1984; Wilson et al. 1994; Rakich, Rumsey 2004). In the\npresent paper, we report on a new concept of three-mirror telescope design for a next-generation\nextremely large telescope.\n2.\n\nTwo-Mirror System\n\nAn all-mirror optical system is characterized by the set of the aperture Di , the radius of\ncurvature ri , and the distance to the next surface of the i-th mirror surface di . We use D1 to\nrepresent the aperture diameter of the primary mirror.\nThe geometry of a two-mirror system is determined when four design parameters (D1 ,\nr1 , d1 , r2 ) are given. We adopt a coordinate system where light proceeds from left to right.\nThus, in a two-mirror system, r1 < 0 and d1 < 0; while r2 < 0 for a Cassegrain system and r2 > 0\nfor a Gregorian system.\nInstead of radius r, we can also use focal length f . In this case, f is positive for a\nconcave mirror and is negative for a convex mirror:\nr2\nr1\nf2 = .\n(1)\nf1 = \u2212 ,\n2\n2\nWe represent the distance from the second mirror to the focal plane of the two-mirror\nsystem by d2 . The imaging formula for the secondary mirror gives\n1\n1\n1\n+ = ,\n(2)\n\u2212(f1 + d1) d2 f2\nand the geometrical relation gives the ratio of focal lengths,\nf1 + d1\nf1\n=\n,\n(3)\nfcomp\nd2\nwhere fcomp is the focal length of the composite system.\nFor a two-mirror system, instead of d2 , we often use the back focus dBF , which is the\ndistance of the focal plane from the primary mirror,\ndBF = d2 + d1.\n\n(4)\n\nIt is more convenient to give three parameters as the focal length of the primary mirror f1 ,\nthe composite focal length fcomp , and the focal position, which is usually represented by dBF .\nInstead of f1 and fcomp , we also use the F -ratio of the primary, F1 = f1 /D1 , and the composite\nF -ratio, Fcomp = fcomp /D1 . When F1 , Fcomp , dBF , and the diameter of the primary D1 are given\nas design parameters, f1 , fcomp , r1 , d1 , and r2 are derived by\nf1 = F1 D1 ,\nFcomp\n,\nfcomp = f1\nF1\nr1 = \u22122f1 ,\nfcomp \u2212 dBF\n,\nd1 = \u2212f1\nfcomp + f1\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n2\n\n\fand\nr2 = \u22122fcomp\n\nf1 + d1\n.\nfcomp \u2212 f1\n\n(9)\n\nBesides the radius, a surface has parameters to characterize its figure: the conic constant,\nk, and the coefficients of higher-order aspheric terms. We describe in the following the design\nprinciple of basic two-mirror optics systems characterized by k1 and k2 , since the third-order\naberration coefficients are governed by these parameters.\nIn a two-mirror system, because k1 and k2 are determined as functions of r1 , r2 , and\nd1 , the astigmatism C and the curvature of field D are also functions of r1 , r2 , and d1 .\n\u221a\nSchwarzschild (1905) provided an anastigmat solution with a flat field as d = 2f and r1 = 2 2f ,\nwhere f is the composite focal length, and is given by 1/f = 2/r1 + 2/r2 \u2212 4d/r1 r2 . Two con\u221a\ncentric sphere system with d1 = \u2212r1 (1 + 5)/2 also gives an anastigmat solution, known as\nSchwarzschild optics, which is used in the microscope objective (Burch 1947). However, if the\nradii and the distance between the mirrors are to be determined by other requirements, such\nas the final focal ratio and the back focal distance, we can no longer make a two-mirror system\nanastigmatic.\nThe classical Cassegrain or Gregorian telescope uses a paraboloid for the primary (k1 =\n\u22121) and a hyperboloid for the secondary (k2 6= \u22121). This arrangement makes it possible to have\na pinpoint image on the optical axis by making the spherical aberration B = 0 by appropriately\nchoosing k2 , but the field of view is limited by remaining non-zero coma F .\nA Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope has no spherical aberration or coma. The use of hyperboloids for both the primary and secondary makes it possible to vanish two principal aberrations\n(k1 and k2 are used to make B = F = 0). Most of the modern large telescopes adopt the Ritchey\u2013\nChr\u00e9tien system because of its wider field of view compared with the classical Cassegrain or\nGregorian system.\nThe remaining aberrations among the third-order aberrations, excepting the distortion,\nare the astigmatism, C, and the curvature of field, D. With k1 and k2 already used to make\nB = F = 0 for the Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien system, there are no parameters available to control C and\nD. It is thus clear that we cannot make an anastigmat with a two-mirror system except for\nsome special cases (Schwarzschild 1905; Burch 1947).\n3.\n\nThree-Mirror System\n\nIn our three-mirror system, the last mirror is placed so that it refocuses the intermediate\nimage made by the first two mirrors. The intermediate focal plane of the first two mirrors is\nused as a virtual third surface, and the last concave mirror is numbered as the fourth surface.\nThree additional free parameters introduced are d3 , r4 , and k4 . We determine r4 by the\ncondition that the Petzval sum P vanishes,\n3\n\n\f1\n1\n1\n\u2212 + = 0.\n(10)\nr1 r2 r4\nFor ordinary telescopes, because the radius of curvature of the primary mirror is larger than\nthat of the secondary mirror, 1/|r1 | is smaller than 1/|r2|. Therefore, the sign of the sum of\nthe first two terms is determined by r2 . Therefore, r2 and r4 should have the same sign. Since\nr4 < 0, r2 < 0, the first two-mirror system should be of the Cassegrain type, not of the Gregorian\ntype.\nThe distance d4 from the third mirror to the final focal position is calculated by\n1\n2\n1\n+\n=\n.\n(11)\nd3 |d4 | |r4 |\nThe magnification factor M by the third mirror is given by\nM=\n\nd4\n.\nd3\n\n(12)\n\nUsing k1 , k2 , and k4 , we can make B = F = C = 0. When we set P = 0, we automatically\nhave D = 0. We thus obtained an anastigmatic optical system with a flat focal plane. As for the\ntreatment of higher order aberration and an evaluation of the optical systems, readers might\nwish to see some reviews (e.g., Wilson 1996; Schroeder 1987). We have not attempted to obtain\nexplicit mathematical expressions for the aberration coefficients of this three-mirror system, but\nused an optimization procedure provided by the optical design program optik written by one\nof the authors (K.N.). Since the sixth-order aspheric coefficients of the mirror surface affect\nthe fifth-order aberration, the sixth-order aspheric coefficient of the primary mirror is used to\ncontrol the spherical aberration of the fifth order of the system. For this case, too, we used\nthe optimizing function of optik. The mathematical expressions for the fifth-order aberration\ncoefficients can be found, for instance, in Matsui (1972). Because there are 12 independent fifthorder aberrations, it is not as straightforward as in the third-order case to control them with\navailable aspheric coefficients, excepting the case of the fifth-order spherical aberration. We\ntherefore treat only the fifth-order spherical aberration using the sixth-order aspheric coefficient\nof the primary mirror.\n4.\n\nExit Pupil\n\nWe now consider the position and the radius of the exit pupil before discussing the\nvignetting problem. Let us study the size of the radius of the exit pupil first. We take the\nprimary mirror as the pupil.\nWe write the lens equations for the second and third mirrors with the sign convention\nfor a single mirror; namely, f2 is negative since the mirror is convex and f4 is positive since the\nmirror is concave. Let ti and t\u2032i be the distances that appear in the imaging of pupil by the i-th\nlens. Note that t2 and t4 are positive, whereas t\u20322 is negative, since the image is imaginary and\nt\u20324 is positive, since the image is real.\n4\n\n\fThe lens equation for the second mirror and the third mirror (= surface 4) is written as\n1 1\n1\n+ \u2032 = , (i = 2, 4).\n(13)\nti ti fi\nLet us define \u03bei and \u03b7i as\nfi\nt\u2032\n\u03bei = , \u03b7i = i , (i = 2, 4).\n(14)\nti\nti\nThen, \u03b7i can be rewritten with \u03bei or with fi and ti as\n\u03bei\nfi\n\u03b7i =\n=\n, (i = 2, 4).\n(15)\n1 \u2212 \u03bei ti \u2212 fi\nSince the distance between the first and the second mirror is usually large compared to the\nfocal length of the secondary mirror, \u03be2 and \u03b72 are small compared to unity, say, 0.1 in a typical\ncase. If the center of curvature of the third mirror is placed at the focal position of the first\ntwo mirrors, f4 = d4 /2 and \u03be4 and \u03b74 may have a value of around 0.3. Using\nt2 = d1 ,\n\nt4 = d2 + d3 \u2212 t\u20322 = d2 + d3 \u2212 f2 (1 + \u03b72),\n\n(16)\n\nwe can rewrite equation (14) explicitly as\n\u03be2 =\n\n\u03b72 =\n\nf2\n,\nd1\n\n\u03be4 =\n\nf2\n,\nd1 \u2212 f2\n\nf4\n=\nd2 + d3 \u2212 t\u20322\n\u03b74 =\n\nf4\nd2 + d3 \u2212\n\nd1 f2\nd1 \u2212 f2\n\nf4\n.\nd1 f2\n\u2212 f4\nd2 + d3 \u2212\nd1 \u2212 f2\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nThe radius Rep of the exit pupil is the radius of the entrance pupil, D1 /2, multiplied by t\u20322 /t2\nand t\u20324 /t4 ,\nRep =\n=\n\nD1 t\u20322 t\u20324 D1 \u03b72 \u03b74\n=\n2 t2 t4\n2\n\n(19)\n\nf2\nD1\n2 (d1 \u2212 f2 )\n\n(20)\n\nf4\n!.\nd1 f2\n\u2212 f4\nd2 + d3 \u2212\nd1 \u2212 f2\n\nThe position of the exit pupil is written as\nf4\nt\u20324 =\n= f4 (1 + \u03b74).\n(21)\n1 \u2212 \u03be4\nNote that the current optical system is not telecentric, since the exit pupil is at a finite\ndistance. The principal rays in the final focal plane are not collimated, but are diverging in\nproportion to the distance from the optical axis. This feature, however, will not be a practical\ndifficulty in designing the observational instrument, unless one wants to cover the entire field,\nfilling 2 m in diameter, in a single optical train.\n\n5\n\n\fTable 1.

We solve this problem by using only the\nsemi-circular half field of view at the focal plane of the first two mirrors. If the magnification\nis M = 1, the image on one half field at this virtual plane is reimaged to the other half side,\nwhere the detector can be placed without essential vignetting.\nIf the magnification/minification factor, M, is not unity, the field of view without vignetting is narrowed because of obstruction. It is easy to see that obstruction on the optical\naxis is always 50% regardless of the value of M.\nFigure 1 illustrates the geometry, showing the third mirror, pupil plane, virtual image\nplane, and final image plane, where the position along the optical axis (z-axis) of each surface\nis measured from the origin set at the apex of the third mirror. In figure 1, we assume that\nat the virtual focal plane of the two-mirror system (surface 3), light passes from left to right\nabove the axis (x > 0), reflected at the third mirror (surface 4), passing through the exit pupil\n(surface 5), and imaged at the final focal plane below the optical axis (x < 0) (surface 6).\nThe point A(\u2212d3 , 0) at the field center of the virtual image plane is reimaged by the\nthird mirror onto the point B(\u2212d4 , 0) of the final image plane. The upper half of the beam\nfrom point A is vignetted at the folding mirror, and does not reach to point B on the detector\nsurface. The limiting radius, h, on the virtual image plane, beyond which the beam from the\nvirtual plane is reflected by the third mirror and refocused on the detector surface, does not\nsuffer any obstruction, and is defined by joining the edge point, A, of the folding mirror and\nthe edge point HP (\u2212t\u20324 , Rep ), of the exit pupil.\nTable 1 gives the coordinates of some particular points for defining the edge of the\npartially vignetted field.\nBecause \u25b3BHF A and \u25b3PHP A are similar to each other,\nMh (M \u2212 1) d3\n=\n.\nRep\nd3 \u2212 t\u20324\n\n(22)\n\nThus, the limiting radius on the image plane, Mh, is written as\n6\n\n\fMh = Rep\n\n(M \u2212 1) d3\nd3 \u2212 t\u20324\n\n= Rep (M \u2212 1)\n\n(23)\n1\n\n1\u2212\n\nt\u20324\n\n=\n\nd3\n\nRep (M 2 \u2212 1)\n.\n1 \u2212 M\u03b74\n\n(24)\n\n5.2.

Note that for M = 1, the 50% vignetting takes place only along the x = 0 axis of\nthe semi-circular field. The field away from this axis by the diffraction size of the optics can be\nmade essentially obstruction-free.\n7\n\n\f6.\n\nExample Layout to Cover the Circular Field\n\nFigure 4 shows an example layout of an all-mirror anastigmat telescope to cover a full\ncircular field of view of 10\u2032 radius by two optical branches, each covering a semi-circular field of\nview. In this figure, only one of the two optical branches is shown, for simplicity. By folding the\nbeam by flat mirrors, M3 and M4, one can have an unvignetted semi-circular focal plane FP\nreimaged by M5 (third aspheric mirror), and refolded by M6 as shown in figure 5, where two\noptical branches are shown. Table 2 gives the lens data of the optical system shown in figure 4.\nA spot diagram out to 10\u2032 from the optical axis is shown in figure 6. Note that the\ndesigned spot sizes are smaller than the diffraction circle for a 30 m ELT out to 8\u2032 .\nActual manufacturing of such an anastigmat system needs to be further studied.\n7.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe present three-mirror anastigmat telescope system provides a flat focal plane with\ndiffraction-limited imaging capability with minimal vignetting. The magnification factor by the\nthird mirror, M, should be designed to be close to unity. Although only a semi-circular field\nof view can be made unvignetted in one optical train, one can cover the entire circular field\nwithout vignetting by deploying two such separate optical trains, each covering a semi-circular\nfield.\nThe present system is similar to the three-mirror anastigmat Korsch system with a 45\u25e6\nmirror placed at the pupil plane (Korsch 1980) concerning its aberration-free optical performance. However, the magnification factor by the third mirror, M, should be large in order to\nmake the vignetting factor small for the Korsch system, whereas the magnification factor by\nthe third mirror should be close to unity in the present system. Therefore, the present system\ncan be used for applications that require a wider field of view. Another merit of the present\nsystem is the avoidance of central obscuration.\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. A.
