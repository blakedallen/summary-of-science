Ideally, the circuits would be constructed in a bottom-up approach\nwith functional units and all the wiring on the molecular scale. To approach the goal, present-day experiments in\nthe area of molecular electronics concentrate on measuring the current-voltage response of single molecules in contact\nto metallic electrodes. In these studies, also purely metallic atomic contacts and wires serve as important reference\nsystems.6\nIn order to support the experiments and to stimulate further technological advance, theoretical modeling of atomicscale charge transport is needed. Here one faces the challenge to describe infinitely extended, low-symmetry quantum\nsystems that may, in addition, be far from equilibrium and involve strong electronic correlations. While a complete\ntheoretical understanding is still lacking, sophisticated ab-initio methods have been developed for approximate but\nparameter-free numerical simulations. In order to study the prototypical metal-molecule-metal systems or metallic\natomic contacts, many groups use density functional theory (DFT) combined with nonequilibrium Green's function\n(NEGF) techniques.7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 Some shortcomings related to the use of DFT in this context\nhave been pointed out, and solutions are being sought.23,24,25,26 On the other hand, from a practical point of view\nDFT presently appears to be one of the most useful ab-initio electronic structure methods, since studies of quantum\ntransport require dealing with a large number of atoms. Furthermore the metal-molecule-metal contacts are hybrid\nsystems, where the central regions frequently behave rather insulator-like, while the electrodes are metallic. For more\ncomplete discussions we refer to Refs. 27,28,29.\nThe DFT approaches can mainly be divided into two types. In the first one, atomic-sized contacts are modelled by\nperiodically repeated supercells, and computer codes developed for solid-state calculations are employed.7,15,22 The\nuse of periodic boundary conditions facilitates the electrode description. However, the conductance is determined for\nan array of parallel junctions and may be affected by artifical interactions between them. The second type is based on\nfinite clusters and originates more from the chemistry community.8,9,14,16,21 It has the advantage that genuinely singleatom or single-molecule contacts are described, and it makes possible investigations of molecules of large transverse\nextent. The drawback is typically the description of the electrode, since it is difficult to treat bulk properties based on\nfinite clusters. Furthermore the coupling between the device region and the electrode can be complicated by finite-size\nand surface mismatch effects.\n\n\f2\nTo arrive at an ab-initio DFT description it is necessary to treat the whole system consistently by using the same\nbasis set and exchange-correlation functional everywhere. The problem of the cluster-based approaches regarding the\nelectrodes is apparent, for example, from the work of Refs. 8,9,21, where the authors resort to a separate tight-binding\nparameterization obtained from the literature.30 Damle et al. proposed to resolve this issue by extracting electrode\nparameters from finite clusters computed within DFT.16,31 However, their treatment of the electrodes should be seen\nas a first approximation, since only couplings between nearest neighbor atoms were considered. Furthermore, they\nfinally use energy-independent self-energies, which is well-justified only for electrode materials with a constant density\nof states (DOS) near the Fermi energy.\nIn this work we present a cluster-based DFT approach for the atomistic description of quantum transport. We\nfollow the ideas of Ref. 31, but place special emphasis on the treatment of the electrodes. In particular, we show\nthat extracting electrode parameters from small metal clusters can lead to an unphysical behavior of the overlap\nof the nonorthogonal basis functions in k-space. The description of the electrodes can be improved systematically\nby employing metal clusters of increasing size. Our implemenation is based on the quantum-chemistry package\nTURBOMOLE, which allows us to treat clusters of several hundred atoms. In this way we obtain an ab-initio\nformulation of quantum transport in atomic-sized contacts, where the whole system is treated on an equal footing. It\nhas the advantage that we can employ high-quality quantum-chemical Gaussian basis sets, which are well-tested for\nisolated systems.\nThe theoretical framework of our approach is presented in Sec. II. Several technical details, related to the use of\nnonorthogonal basis functions and the electrode treatment can be found in Apps. A and B. To demonstrate the power\nof our methods we study in Sec. III the transport properties of atomic contacts of Au and Al. The choice of these\nmaterials is motivated by the fact that Au exhibits a rather energy-independent DOS near the Fermi energy, while\nAl does not. Furthermore, for these systems we can compare our results to the literature. We find good agreement,\nand demonstrate the robustness of our results. Further applications have been presented in Refs. 32,33,34,35,36. We\nsummarize our results in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL APPROACH\nA.\n\nElectronic structure\n\nOur ab-initio calculations are based on the implementation of DFT in TURBOMOLE 5.9.37 By ab-initio we mean\nthat the simulations require no system-specific parameters. Self-consistent DFT calculations of large systems are\ngenerally very time-consuming. TURBOMOLE, however, is specialized in handling such systems, and offers several\npossibilities to reduce the computational effort. Thus, one can exploit point group symmetries, including non-Abelian\nones. In this way, the calculations speed up by a factor given by the order of the point group. Further options are\nthe \"resolution of the identity in J\" (RI-J)38,39 and the \"multipole-accelerated resolution of the identity J\" (MARIJ),40 which are both implemented in the ridft module of TURBOMOLE. The approximations help to reduce the\neffort to compute the Coulomb integrals J, which are particularly expensive to evaluate. With the help of the RI-J\napproximation, known also under the name \"density fitting\", the four-center-two-electron integrals can be expressed\nas three-center-two-electron ones.41 Calculations are faster by a factor of 10-100 as compared to standard DFT,\nbut equally accurate. The MARI-J technique concerns the Coulomb interactions between distant atoms. They are\ndivided into a near-field and a far-field part, where the near field is treated with RI-J and the far field by a multipole\napproximation. Compared to RI-J, it can accelerate the calculations by another factor of 2-7.40 DFT requires the\nchoice of an exchange-correlation functional.42 We select the generalized-gradient functional BP86,43,44 which is known\nto yield good results for large metal clusters.45,46,47,48 To express the orbital wave functions, Gaussian basis sets of\nsplit-valence-plus-polarization (SVP) quality are used,38,39,49 which are the TURBOMOLE standard. Within the\nclosed-shell formalism of DFT, total energies of all our clusters are converged to a precision better than 10\u22126 a.u. In\norder to obtain ground-state structures, the total energy needs to be minimized with respect to the nuclear coordinates.\nWe perform such geometry optimizations or \"relaxations\" until the maximum norm of the Cartesian gradient has\nfallen below 10\u22124 a.u.\nB.\n\nTransport formalism\n\nWe compute transport properties of atomic-sized contacts using the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker theory and Green's functions\nexpressed in a local, nonorthogonal basis.50,51 The local atomic basis allows us to partition the basis states |i, \u03b1i into\nleft (L), central (C), and right (R) ones, according to a division of the contact geometry. In the basis states, \u03b1 refers to\nthe type of orbital at the position of atom i. For reasons of brevity we will frequently suppress the orbital index. The\n\n\f3\nHamiltonian (or Kohn-Sham) matrix Hi\u03b1,j\u03b2 = hi, \u03b1| H |j, \u03b2i, and analogously the overlap matrix Si\u03b1,j\u03b2 = hi, \u03b1 |j, \u03b2i,\ncan thus be written in block form,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nHLL HLC\n0\nH = \uf8ed HCL HCC HCR \uf8f8 .\n(1)\n0 HRC HRR\nBoth S and H are real-valued and are hence symmetric. In addition, we assume the C region to be large enough to\nhave SLR = HLR = 0. Within the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker theory,52 the linear conductance can be expressed as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u2202\n2e2\nf (E, T ) \u03c4 (E),\n(2)\ndE \u2212\nG=\nh\n\u2202E\n\u22121\n\nwhere f (E, T ) = {exp [(E \u2212 \u03bc) / (kB T )] + 1} is the Fermi function, and the chemical potential \u03bc is approximately\nequal to the Fermi energy EF , \u03bc \u2248 EF . Using the standard NEGF technique, the transmission function is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c4 (E) = Tr [\u0393L (E)GrCC (E)\u0393R (E)GaCC (E)] = Tr t\u2020 (E)t(E)\n(3)\nwith the transmission matrix\n\nt(E) =\nHere we define the Green's functions\n\np\np\n\u0393R (E)GaCC (E) \u0393L (E).\n\nGrCC (E) = [ESCC \u2212 HCC \u2212 \u03a3rL (E) \u2212 \u03a3rR (E)]\n\n(4)\n\n\u22121\n\n(5)\n\n\u2020\n\nand GaCC = [GrCC ] , the self-energies\nr\n\u03a3rX (E) = (HCX \u2212 ESCX ) gXX\n(E) (HXC \u2212 ESXC ) ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u0393X (E) = \u22122Im [\u03a3rX (E)] ,\n\n(7)\n\nand the scattering-rate matrices\n\nr\nwhere gXX\nis the electrode Green's function for lead X = L,R. At low temperatures, the expression for the conductance simplifies to\n\nG=\n\nX\n2e2\n\u03c4 (EF ) = G0\n\u03c4n (EF ),\nh\nn\n\n(8)\n\nwith G0 = 2e2 /h the quantum of conductance and \u03c4n the eigenvalues of t\u2020 t. The latter are the transmission probabilities of the transmission channels n.85 Also other observables, such as the thermopower or the photoconductance,\ncan be studied based on the knowledge of \u03c4 (E).32,33,53,54\nInformation on the energetics of a system may help to identify conduction mechanisms. Such information can be\nextracted from the spectral density55\n\u03c1(E) =\n\ni\n1\n[Gr (E) \u2212 Ga (E)] = \u2212 Im [Gr (E)] .\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\nUsing this, we define the local density of states (LDOS) at atom i and its decomposition into orbitals \u03b1 via\nX\nLDOSi (E) =\nLDOSi\u03b1 (E)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1\n\nLDOSi\u03b1 (E) =\n\n\u0010\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nSCC \u033aCC (E)SCC\n\n\u0011\n\ni\u03b1,i\u03b1\n\n(11)\n\nIn App. A we discuss the approximations involved in this definition. There we also consider further the issues related\nto the use of nonorthogonal basis sets to evaluate the single-particle Green's functions and the electric current.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1: Quantum transport scheme. The conduction properties of an atomic-sized contact (a) shall be studied. For this\npurpose it is divided into a C region and two semi-infinite L and R electrodes. Using a similar division as for the contact,\ninformation on the electronic structure of the C region (SCC , HCC ) as well as the CL and CR couplings (SCL , HCL and SCR ,\nHCR ) is extracted from the ECC (b). In order to obtain the self-energies \u03a3rL and \u03a3rR (a), the remaining task is to determine\nr\nr\nthe electrode surface Green's functions gLL\nand gRR\n. This procedure is described further below in the text.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation of the transport method\n1.\n\nCentral system\n\nIn order to determine the transmission function \u03c4 (E) we need a practical scheme to obtain the necessary information\non the electronic structure. In Fig. 1 we present our procedure. The goal is to describe the whole atomic-sized contact\n[Fig. 1(a)] consistently, by treating the L, C, and R regions with the same basis set and exchange-correlation functional.\nWe obtain the parameters SCC and HCC as well as the couplings to the electrodes SCX and HCX with X = L, R from\nthe extended central system (ECC) [Fig. 1(b)], in which we include large parts of the tips of the metallic electrodes.\nThe division of the ECC into the L, C, and R regions is performed so that the C region is identical to that in Fig. 1(a).\nThe atoms in the L and R parts of the ECC [blue-shaded regions in Fig. 1(a)] correspond to that part of the electrodes\nthat is assumed to couple to C. The partitioning or division of the ECC is commonly made somewhere in the middle\nof the metal tips, and we will also refer to it as \"cut\". The electrodes [L and R regions in Fig. 1(a)] are modeled as\nr\nsurfaces of semi-infinite crystals, described by the surface Green's functions gXX\n. They are constructed from bulk\nparameters, extracted from large metal clusters. Further below we discuss in detail, how this is accomplished.\nIn our approach, we assume the metal tips included in the ECC to be large enough to satisfy basically two criteria.\nFirst, all the charge transfer between the L and R electrodes and the C part of the contact should be accounted for.\nThis ensures the proper alignment of the electronic levels in C with EF . Second, most of the metal tips, especially\nthe L and R parts of the ECC, should resemble bulk as closely as possible. In this way, we can evaluate the surface\nGreen's functions by using bulk parameters of an infinitely extended crystal. Owing to surface effects caused by the\nfinite size of the ECC, this can be satisfied only approximately. The mismatch between the parameters in the L and\nR regions of the contact and the ECC will thus lead to spurious scattering at the LC and CR interfaces. In principle\nthis resistance can be eliminated systematically by including more atoms in the metal tips of the ECC. On the other\nhand, if the resistance in the C region is much larger than the spurious LC and CR interface resistances, they will\nhave little influence on the results.\n2.\n\nElectrodes\n\nWe extract bulk parameters describing perfect crystals from large metal clusters. The complete procedure, which\nr\naims at determining the surface Green's functions gXX\nwith X = L, R is summarized in Fig. 2. In this work we study\nexclusively electrode materials with an fcc structure, of which Au and Al are examples.\nIn a first step [Fig. 2(a)] we construct spherical metal clusters, henceforth called \"spheres\". They are made up of\n~ j |R\n~ j = P3 jn~an \u2227 |R\n~ j | \u2264 Rsphere } with the standard fcc primitive lattice vectors ~an and the\natoms at positions {R\nn=1\nsphere\nsphere radius R\n. Here, we will use the vector of integer indices j = (j1 , j2 , j3 ) to characterize the atomic position\n~ j . We do not relax the spheres, but set the lattice constant a0 to its experimental literature value.56 Increasing the\nR\nradius Rsphere should make the electronic structure in the center resemble that of a crystal. From the clusters we\nextract the overlap and Hamiltonian between the central atom at position 0 and the neighboring ones at position j\nsphere\nsphere\n(including j = 0). This yields the matrix elements Sj\u03b1,0\u03b2\nand Hj\u03b1,0\u03b2\n, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 stand for the basis functions\nsphere\nsphere\nof the atoms at j and 0. For reasons of brevity, we will often suppress the orbital indices. Sj0\nand Hj0\nare\n\n\f5\n\nr\nFigure 2: In order to obtain the electrode Green's functions gXX\nfor lead X = L, R, we determine bulk parameters from large\nsphere\nsphere\nmetal clusters. In a first step (a) we extract overlap and hopping elements, Sj0\n, Hj0\n, from the cluster's central atom to\nall its neighbors. They are (b) symmetrized by imposing the space-group of the electrode lattice. After (c) a rotation to adapt\nr\nthem to the orientation of the respective electrode, (d) gXX\nis constructed with the help of a decimation procedure.\n\nthen matrices with appropriate dimensions.\nsphere\nThe bulk parameters Sj0 , Hj0 need to satisfy the symmetries of the fcc space-group [Fig. 2(b)]. While Sj0\ndepends only on the relative position of atoms, surface effects due to the finite size of the fcc clusters lead to deviations\n(X)\n(X)\nsphere\nfrom the translational symmetry for Hj0\n. A rotation may still be necessary to arrive at parameters Sj0 , Hj0 ,\nwhich are adapted to the orientation of the electrode X = L, R [Fig. 2(c)]. Details on the symmetrization procedure\n(X)\n(X)\nand the transformation of crystal parameters under rotations are presented in App. B. The parameters Sj0 , Hj0\nr\nare finally employed to construct the semi-infinite crystals and to obtain the surface Green's function gXX [Fig. 2(d)].\nr\nDue to the finite range of the couplings SCX , HCX , we need to determine gXX\nfor the first few surface layers only\n[blue-shaded regions in Fig. 1(a)]. We compute these with the help of the decimation technique of Ref. 57, which we\nhave generalized to deal with the nonorthogonal basis sets.58 The parameters Sj0 , Hj0 can be computed once for a\ngiven metal and can then be used in transport calculations with electrodes of various spatial orientations.\nFor Au (a0 = 4.08 \u00c5) we have analyzed spheres ranging between 13 and 429 atoms, while for Al (a0 = 4.05 \u00c5)\nthey vary between 13 and 555 atoms. Since we want to describe bulk, the parameters extracted from the largest\nclusters will obviously provide the best description. There is, however, an additional criterion, which necessitates the\nuse of large metal clusters for a reliable description of the electrodes. As discussed in App. B 1, it is based on the\npositive-semidefiniteness of the bulk overlap matrix. We find a strong violation of this criterion, if the extraction of\nparameters is performed such that only the couplings of the cental atom to its nearest neighbors are considered. As a\nfurther demonstration of the quality of our description, we show in App. B 2 the convergence of the DOS with respect\nto Rsphere .\nFor the transport calculations we need a value for the Fermi energy. The biggest Au and Al spheres computed,\nAu429 and Al555 , respectively, are very metallic. They exhibit differences between the highest occupied molecular\norbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of less than 0.06 eV. Therefore we set EF\nmidway between these energies. In this way we obtain EF = \u22125.0 eV for Au and EF = \u22124.3 eV for Al. The values\nwill be used in all the results below. Notice that the negative values of EF agree well with experimental work functions\nof 5.31 to 5.47 eV for Au and 4.06 to 4.26 eV for Al.59\nIII.\n\nMETALLIC ATOMIC CONTACTS\n\nIn this chapter we explore the conduction properties of metallic atomic contacts of Au and Al. These systems,\nin particular atomic-sized Au contacts, have been studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically, and can\ntherefore be used to test our method. We start by discussing the transport properties of the Au contacts, consisting\nof a four-atom chain, a three-atom chain, and a two-atom chain or \"dimer\". Since Al does not form such chains, we\nconsider only a single-atom contact. For all systems we analyze the transmission, its channel decomposition, and,\nin order to obtain knowledge about the conduction mechanism, the LDOS for atoms in the narrowest part of the\ncontact. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our transmission curves with respect to different partitionings\nof the large ECCs.\nA.\n\nGold contacts\n\nLet us first discuss the electronic structure of Au, where we display the DOS in Fig. 3. The Fermi energy at\nEF = \u22125.0 eV is located in a fairly structureless, flat region somewhat above the d band. Based on the electronic\nconfiguration [Xe].4f 14 .5d10 .6s1 of the atom, one might have expected a strong contribution only from the s orbitals\nat EF . But, as is visible from Fig. 3(b), s, p, and d states all yield comparable contributions.86 This signifies that\nvalence orbitals hybridize strongly in the metal.\n\n\f6\n1.2\n(a)\n\n0.05\n\ntotal\ns\np\nd\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nDOS (1/eV)\n\nDOS (1/eV)\n\n1\n\n0.06\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\ns\npx,py,pz\ndxy, dxz, dyz\nd3z2-r2, dx2-y2\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n-14\n\n-12\n\n-10 -8\n-6\nenergy (eV)\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-4\n-5\nenergy (eV)\n\n-3\n\nFigure 3: DOS for Au. (a) DOS resolved into s, p, and d contributions and (b) DOS resolved into all individual orbital\ncomponents. The dashed vertical line indicates EF = \u22125.0 eV.\n\nWhen an atomic contact of Au is in a dimer or atomic chain configuration, a conductance of around 1G0 is expected\nfrom experimental measurements60,61,62,63,64 as well as from theoretical studies.7,65,66,67,68 The analysis shows that\nthis value of the conductance is due to a single, almost fully transparent transmission channel. It arises dominantly\nfrom the s orbitals of the noble metal Au, since the electronic structure in the narrowest part of the contact resembles\nmore the electronic configuration of the atom.64,65\n1.\n\nDetermination of contact geometries\n\nDespite the consensus that the conductance of atomic chains of Au is around 1G0 , the precise atomic positions\nplay an important role.68,69 Therefore it is necessary to construct reference geometries that have been studied with\na well-established transport method. We choose to compare to results obtained with TRANSIESTA.7 The ECCs\ninvestigated are shown in Fig. 4. The four-atom Au chain with electrodes oriented in the [100] direction, called\nAu100c4, corresponds to a contact geometry examined in Ref. 70 [see Fig. 1(b) therein]. The three-atom Au chain,\nAu111c3, is similar to a configuration in Fig. 9(d) of Ref. 7. In addition, we study a Au dimer contact, Au111c2, where\na two-atom chain is forming the narrowest part. In contrast to Au100c4, for the latter two contacts the electrodes are\nalong the [111] direction.\nLet us briefly explain, how we determine these geometries (Fig. 4). For Au100c4 we construct two ideal, atomically\nsharp Au [100] pyramids, with two atoms in between. The pyramids end with the layer consisting of 25 atoms. The\ndistance between the layers containing four atoms is set to 12.68 \u00c5 [Fig. 4(a)], as in Ref. 70. Next we relax the four\nchain atoms without imposing symmetries, keeping all other atoms fixed. After geometry optimization, we find that\n\nFigure 4: ECCs for Au. (a) Au100c4 is a four-atom Au chain, (b) Au111c3 is a three-atom Au chain, and (c) Au111c2 is a\ntwo-atom Au chain or dimer contact. For (a) electrodes are oriented in the [100] direction, while for (b) and (c) this is the [111]\ndirection. The main crystallographic direction is assumed to be parallel to the z axis. Indicated are also the most important\nbond distances together with information on the construction of the ECCs.\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 5: Au100c4. (a) ECC with two different partitionings into L, C, and R regions, cuts 1 and 2, and (b) the transmission\nas a function of the energy for these cuts. For cut 2 (c) transmission resolved into its transmission channels and (d) LDOS of\nthe chain atom indicated in (a).\n\nthe configuration agrees well with symmetry D4h . We add two more Au layers with 16 and 9 atoms on each side, where\nthe ECC now consists of 162 atoms, and perform a final DFT calculation, exploiting the symmetry D4h . As compared\nto Ref. 70, all bond distances indicated in Fig. 4(a) agree to within 0.01 \u00c5, except for the distance between the central\nchain atoms, where our distance is shorter by 0.07 \u00c5. For Au111c3 we proceed similarly to Au100c4 [Fig. 4(b)]. We\nstart with two perfect Au [111] pyramids, set the distance between the Au layers with 3 atoms to 9.91 \u00c5,7 and cut\nthe pyramid off at the layers containing 10 atoms. Then we add one atom in the middle, relax the three chain atoms,\nadd two layers on each side with 12 and 6 atoms, and perform a calculation in symmetry D3d . Au111c3 consists of 77\natoms in total. Our bond distances agree with those in Fig. 9(d) of Ref. 7 to within 0.02 \u00c5. For Au111c2 we include\nalso the first Au layer in the geometry optimization process. The distance between the fixed layers with 6 atoms is\n12.12 \u00c5. Otherwise the steps are the same as for Au111c3. The ECC is computed in symmetry D3d and consists of 76\natoms. In the parts excluded from the geometry optimization, atoms are all positioned on the bulk fcc lattice, where\nwe set the lattice constant to the experimental value of 4.08 \u00c5, which corresponds to a nearest-neighbor distance of\n2.88 \u00c5. In each ECC the main crystallographic direction is aligned with the z axis, which is the transport direction.\n2.\n\nFour-atom gold chain\n\nLet us now study the conduction properties for the contact Au100c4 [Fig. 5(a)]. There are different possibilities to\npartition the ECC into the L, C, and R regions. The cuts should be done so that L and R are unconnected (SLR = 0\nand HLR = 0, see Sec. II B). Hence the C region must be long enough. In order to describe well the coupling to the\nelectrode surface (Fig. 1), it is furthermore necessary to have sufficiently many layers in the L and R regions. We\nobserve that at least two layers are needed to obtain reasonable transmission curves. For the two different cuts of\nFig. 5(a) \u03c4 (E) is plotted in Fig. 5(b). In both cases it is found to be almost identical, indicating a sufficient robustness\nof our method. The transmissions at the Fermi energy are \u03c4 (EF ) = 0.93 and 0.98 for cuts 1 and 2, respectively. These\nvalues correspond well to the result \u03c4 (EF ) = 0.99 of Ref. 70.\nFor cut 2 it is visible in Fig. 5(c) that the transmission at EF is dominated by a single channel, in good agreement\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 6: Au111c3. (a) ECC with two different partitionings into L, C, and R regions, cuts 1 and 2, and (b) the transmission\nas a function of the energy for these cuts. For cut 1 (c) transmission resolved into its transmission channels and (d) LDOS of\nthe central chain atom indicated in the ECC.\n\nwith experimental observations64 and previous theoretical studies.7,66 In general, the electronic structure at the\nnarrowest part should have the most decisive influence on the conductance of an atomic contact. Therefore we plot in\nFig. 5(d) the LDOS of the atom indicated by the arrow in Fig. 5(a), resolved in its individual orbital contributions.\nCompared to the bulk DOS of Fig. 3, it is dominated by s at EF , where the contributions of all other orbitals than\ns and pz are suppressed. These two orbitals will form the almost fully transparent transmission channel, which is\nradially symmetric with respect to the z axis.\n3.\n\nThree-atom gold chain\n\nExactly the same analysis will now be carried out for the contact Au111c3. In Fig. 6 the geometry of the ECC, the\ntransmission for different partitionings, the transmission channels, and the LDOS of the central chain atom are shown.\nAs for Au100c4, we observe that the different cuts yield very similar transmission curves [Fig. 6(b)]. Furthermore\nall the basic features in \u03c4 (E) are the same as in the TRANSIESTA calculation [see Fig. 11(d) of Ref. 7]. Above the\nd band, which exhibits a very narrow and high final peak, there is a dip in \u03c4 (E) in both cases. The transmission\nrecovers, however, and a flat region with a value of around one is visible. At the Fermi energy cuts 1 and 2 yield\n\u03c4 (EF ) = 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. This is in reasonable agreement with \u03c4 (EF ) = 0.94 in Ref. 7, considering the\ndifferences in the electrode geometry, basis set, and exchange-correlation functional. We observe from Fig. 6(c) for\ncut 1 that the transmission at EF is dominated by a single transmission channel, and the LDOS indicates a dominant\ncontribution of s orbitals [Fig. 6(d)]. In addition, the peak structures in \u03c4 (E) for the d states correspond well to peaks\nin the LDOS. This observation can also be made in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d) for Au100c4.\n\n\f9\n\nFigure 7: Au111c2. (a) ECC, and for the cut and atom indicated (b) the transmission resolved into its transmission channels\nand (c) the LDOS with its individual orbital contributions, respectively.\n\n4.\n\nTwo-atom gold chain\n\nThe transmission and LDOS resolved into transmission channels and orbital components, respectively, are shown\nin Fig. 7 for the dimer contact Au111c2. As for Au100c4 and Au111c3 we observe a single dominant channel at EF ,\nand \u03c4 (EF ) = 0.96. The finding of such a dominant channel for chains of two or more atoms is in good agreement with\nour analysis of less symmetric contacts, which were based on a combination of a tight-binding model and classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations.68 However, that \u03c4 (E) increases partly even above one in the vicinity of EF , signals\nthat the influence of other channels is increased as compared to Au100c4 and Au111c3. Indeed, the LDOS of the atom\nin the narrowest part of the constriction [Figs. 7(a) and 7(c)] shows in particular increased px and py contributions.\nAlso, the d states exhibit a less pronounced peak structure than was visible in Figs. 5(d) and 6(d). This is due to the\nhigher coordination number of the atom and the enhanced coupling to the electrodes.\nB.\n\nAluminum contacts\n\nAs is visible from the bulk DOS in Fig. 8, the electronic structure of Al differs substantially from that for Au. While\nthe latter is a noble metal with an s valence, the Al atom has the electronic configuration [Ne].3s2 .3p1 with an open\np shell, and the metal is hence considered sp-valent. The strong contribution of s and p states is also observed in the\nDOS, where d states play only a minor role. As compared to Au, the DOS exhibits a noticeable energy dependence\naround EF .\nFor Al we study an ideal fcc [111] pyramid, consisting of 251 atoms [Fig. 9(a)], henceforth referred to as Al111c1.\nIdeal means that the atoms are positioned on an fcc lattice with the experimental lattice constant a0 = 4.05 \u00c5.

For cut 2 (c) the transmission resolved into its transmission channels and (d) the\nLDOS of the central atom, indicated by the arrow in (a). The nearest-neighbor distance shown in the ECC is identical for all\natoms.\n\n1.\n\nAluminum single-atom contact\n\nIn Fig. 9 the transmission is displayed for three different partitionings of the ECC Al111c1. Also shown are the\ntransmission channels and the LDOS of the atom in the narrowest part of the contact for a selected cut. For energies\nbelow \u22126 eV, there are practically no differences visible between the curves for the three different partitionings.\nNevertheless, some deviations arise at EF , and we obtain \u03c4 (EF ) = 2.36 (cut 1), 1.88 (cut 2), and 2.23 (cut 3). Similar\nto Au, we attribute these 20% relative variations to spurious scattering at the LC and CR interfaces. Our values\nfor \u03c4 (EF ) of around two agrees nicely with those reported for single-atom contacts in Ref. 12. Compared to Au, the\ntransmission-channel structure has changed in an obvious way. There are three channels at EF , which is in line with\nexperimental observations of Refs. 64,71. Due to the D3d symmetry of the ECC, transmission-channel degeneracies\narise, where in particular \u03c42 = \u03c43 . As is visible from the LDOS, these additional channel contributions mainly stem\nfrom the px and py orbitals, while s and pz are forming the nondegenerate \u03c41 .64,65,72\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have developed a cluster-based method to study the charge transport properties of molecular and atomic\ncontacts. We treat the electronic structure at the level of DFT, and describe transport in terms of the Landauer\nformalism expressed with standard Green's function techniques. Special emphasis is placed on the modeling of the\nelectrodes and the construction of the associated bulk parameters from spherical metal clusters. We showed that\nthese clusters need to be sufficiently large to produce reliable bulk parameters, where a criterion for the extent of\nthe spherical clusters is set by the overlap of the nonorthogonal basis functions. In our studies we crucially rely on\nthe accurate and efficient quantum-chemical treatment of systems consisting of several hundred atoms, made possible\nby use of the quantum chemistry package TURBOMOLE. Compared to supercell approached, our method has the\n\n\f11\nadvantage that we genuinely describe single-atom or single-molecule contacts.\nAs an application of our method we analyzed Au and Al atomic contacts. Studying a four-, a three-, and a twoatom chain with varied electrode lattice orientations for Au, we found a conductance close to 1G0 , carried by a single\ntransmission channel. Next we investigated an ideal Al single-atom contact, and found three transmission channels\nto contribute significantly to the conductance of around 2G0 . These results are in good agreement with previous\nexperimental and theoretical investigations. Both for Au and Al we demonstrated the robustness of our transmission\ncurves with respect to partitionings of the contact systems. The results illustrate the applicability of our method to\nvarious electrode materials.\nBeside the metallic atomic contacts examined here, the presented method has been applied in the field of\nmolecular electronics. Studies include the dc conduction properties of dithiolated-oligophenylene and diaminoalkane junctions32,33,35,36 as well as oxygen adsorbates in Al contacts.34 In addition, the thermopower32 and\nphotoconductance33 of molecular junctions has been investigated in this way. Our studies demonstrate the value\nof parameter-free modeling for understanding transport at the molecular and atomic scale.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank R.

The electronic structure is described in the spirit of the linear\ncombination of atomic orbitals (LCAO),41,73,74 and this is also how TURBOMOLE is implemented. While it is in\nprinciple always possible to transform to an orthogonal basis, it may be more convenient to work directly with the\nnonorthogonal states.\nA concise mathematical description using nonorthogonal basis states can be formulated in terms of tensors. The\nformalism is presented in a fairly general form in Ref. 75, where also the modifications of second quantization are\naddressed. Below we discuss some of the subtleties related to the use of nonorthogonal basis functions that are\nimportant for our method.58 Since the basis functions are real-valued in our case, the full complexity of the tensor\nformalism is not needed.76,77 Furthermore we use a simplified notation, where all tensor indices appear as subscripts\nof matrices.\n1.\n\nCurrent formula for nonorthogonal, local basis sets\n\nThe most important quantity for transport calculations is the electric current. In the NEGF formalism, its determination requires a separation of the contact into subsystems similar to Fig. 1(a).52,78,79 However, due to the overlap\nof the basis functions in a nonorthogonal basis, the charges of the subsystems are not well defined. Different ways of\ndetermining them exist, e.g. the Mulliken or L\u00f6wdin population analysis.73 Despite these additional complications,\nthe Landauer formula [Eq. (2)] can be derived in a similar fashion as for an orthogonal basis. Recent discussions of\nthe derivation can be found in Refs. 51,80.\n2.\n\nSingle-particle Green's functions\n\nConsider the single-particle Hamiltonian H describing the entire system. The retarded Green's operator is defined\n\u22121\nas Gr (E) = [(E + i0+ ) 1 \u2212 H] . Now consider the local, nonorthogonal basis |ii with the (covariant) matrix elements\nof the overlap Sij = hi |ji and the Hamiltonian Hij = hi| H |ji.76,77 Compared to Sec. II B the index i, used throughout\nthis appendix, is a collective index, denoting both the position at which the basis state is centered and its type. The\n\n\f12\ncomponents of the retarded Green's function, defined by Gr =\nX\u0002\nk\n\nP\n\ni,j\n\n|iiGrij hj|,87 satisfy the equation50\n\n\u0001\n\u0003\nE + i0+ Sjk \u2212 Hjk Grkl (E) = \u03b4jl .\n\n(A1)\n\nThe Green's function GrCC is defined as Grij restricted to the central region C. It can be calculated according\nto Eq. (5). Due to the nonorthogonal basis, the perturbation that couples C to the lead X = L, R and enters the\nself-energy [Eq. (6)], is given by HCX \u2212 ESCX and thus includes also an overlap contribution. It is interesting to\nobserve that as E \u2192 \u221e the self-energies and the Green's function behave as\n\u22121\n\n\u03a3rX (E) E\n\u2192\n)\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u221e\n\u2192 ESCX (SXX\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\nS\nGCC E\n\u2192\nCC\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u221e\n\u2192 E\n\nwith\nS\n\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\nCC\n\n\uf8ee\n\n= \uf8f0SCC +\n\nX\n\nSXC\n\n(A2)\n(A3)\n\n\u22121\n\nSCX (SXX )\n\nX=L,R\n\n\uf8f9\u22121\n\nSXC \uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(A4)\n\nThus also the inverse overlap matrix of C is \"renormalized\" due to the coupling to the leads.\n3.\n\nLocal density of states\n\nUsing a set P\nof orthonormal energy eigenstates |\u03bci that satisfy H |\u03bci = \u03b5\u03bc |\u03bci, we obtain the decomposition \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd (E) =\nh\u03bc|\u03c1(E)|\u03bdi = \u03bc \u03b4(E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bc )\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd of the spectral density defined by Eq.

Since the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the overlap decay similarly with increasing\ninteratomic distance, we can concentrate on the overlap. For it a rather well-defined criterion can be found: The\nclusters should so large that the extracted bulk overlap matrix is positive-semidefinite.\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 10: s-orbital-chain model.

To do so for a complex quantum-chemistry basis set, we define the positive-definiteness measure\n\u03be(Rsphere ) = min(S(~k)).\n~\nk\n\n(B3)\n\nIn this expression S(~k) is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix S\u03b1\u03b2 (~k), where S\u03b1\u03b2 (~k) is constructed from the crystal\nP\n~ ~\nparameters extracted from a cluster with radius Rsphere [S\u03b1\u03b2 (~k) = R~ j ;|R~j |\u2264Rsphere e\u2212ik*Rj Sj\u03b1,0\u03b2 ]. In the discrete\nFourier transformations we assume periodic boundary conditions with a finite periodicity length along the standard\nprimitive lattice vectors.56,58 Rsphere must be chosen large enough for \u03be to be positive or, if \u03be remains negative, it\nmust at least be sufficiently small in absolute value.\nLet us first illustrate the behavior of \u03be at the example of an s-orbital model. Gaussian s functions are described by\n\u03c6s (~r) =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03b1\n\u03c0\n\n\u00133/4\n\n2\n\ne\u2212\u03b1|~r|\n\nwith an exponent \u03b1, characterizing the radial decay. Hence, the overlap between two atoms\nZ\n~ j )\u03c6s (~r) = e\u2212\u03b1R2j /2\nSjs,0s = d3 r\u03c6s (~r \u2212 R\n\n(B4)\n\n(B5)\n\n~ j | like a Gaussian function. We consider an infinitely extended chain with atoms\ndecays with their distance Rj = |R\n~ j = j1 a0~ex ). The overlap from a selected atom to its neighbors drops\nat equally spaced positions along the x-axis (R\noff exponentially as shown in Fig. 10(a). The Fourier transformation will again result in a Gaussian with purely\npositive values Sss (kx ) [Fig. 10(b)]. If, however, overlap matrix elements are taken into account only up to a certain\n~ j | \u2264 Rsphere , as in a finite cluster, a rough sin(kx )/kx -behavior results, where Sss (kx ) becomes\nmaximum value |R\nnegative at certain k-values. Upon an increase of Rsphere , Sss (kx ) will evolve into a Gaussian function and \u03be will thus\napproach zero from below. The negative tails of Sss (kx ) are unphysical, and our observation implies that the clusters\nused to extract bulk parameters (Fig. 2) need to be of a sufficiently large radius Rsphere , in order to obtain a reliable\ndescription of a crystal. Obviously, the magnitude of Rsphere depends on the basis set chosen.\n\n\f14\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n-0.4\n\nAu\n\nAl\n\n\u03be\n\n\u03be\n\n-1\n-1.5\n\n-0.8\n\nSVP\nLANL2DZ\n\n-2\n\nSVP\n\n-2.5\n-3\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nsphere\nR\n/a0\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-1.2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nsphere\nR\n/a0\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 11: The positive-definiteness measure \u03be for Au and Al as a function of Rsphere . Beside the SVP basis set, the behavior\nof \u03be is also shown for LANL2DZ, used in Refs. 16,31. S(~k) [Eq. (B2)] is evaluated at 323 k-points. The radius Rsphere has been\nscaled with the respective lattice constants (a0 = 4.08 \u00c5 for Au and a0 = 4.05 \u00c5 for Al).\n\nIn Fig. 11 we plot the behavior of \u03be as a function of Rsphere for Au and Al. Beside the results for the SVP basis\nset, we display \u03be for Au also for the basis set LANL2DZ, used in Refs. 16,31. It is visible that \u03be is positive for a single\natom (Rsphere = 0), but negative for small spheres. With increasing Rsphere , \u03be approaches 0 from below similar to the\ns-orbital model. We find that the elimination of diffuse functions reduces the radius Rsphere for \u03be to become positive\nor negligibly small. For practical reasons it may happen that Rsphere cannot be chosen large enough to fulfill the\npositive-semidefiniteness criterion \u03be \u2265 0. In such a case negative eigenvalues of S\u03b1\u03b2 (~k) can lead to negative eigenvalues\nr\nof the scattering-rate matrices \u0393X [Eq. (7)], since \u03c1XX = \u2212Im [gXX\n] /\u03c0 may no longer be positive-semidefinite (see\nalso the discussion in Sec. A 3).\n2.\n\nBulk densities of states\n\nThe DOS can be used as another measure for the convergence to a solid-state description. With a k-space Hamiltonian in an orthogonal basis set H orth (~k), it is given as\nh h\nii\nX\n1\n,\n(B6)\nDOS(E) =\nDOS\u03b1 (E) = \u2212 Tr\u03b1 Im Gorth,r\n0\u03b1,0\u03b1 (E)\n\u03c0\n\u03b1\nR\nwhere \u03b1 runs over all basis functions on a bulk atom and Gorth,r\n(E) = BZ d3 kGorth,r (~k, E)/VBZ with Gorth,r (~k, E) =\n00\ni\u22121\nh\nand with the volume VBZ of the first Brillouin zone BZ. The orthogonal Hamiltonian can be\nE 1 \u2212 H orth (~k)\n\nobtained in several ways. Two possible choices are (i) to Fourier transform Sj0 and Hj0 and perform a L\u00f6wdin\north\northogonalization in k-space H orth (~k) = S \u22121/2 (~k)H(~k)S \u22121/2 (~k) or (ii) to construct Hj0\n, which involves the L\u00f6wdin\n\u0001\n\u0001\nsphere\nsphere\nsphere,orth\nin real space, extraction of Hj0\nand the\ntransformation H sphere,orth = S \u22121/2\nH sphere S \u22121/2\nimposing of the fcc space group, and to carry out the Fourier transformation only thereafter. For parameters extracted\nfrom large enough clusters we observe the equivalence of the DOS construction with respect to the two different\northogonal Hamiltonians H orth (~k). If \u03be remains (slightly) negative due to a too small Rsphere , then the construction\north\nof the DOS from Hj0\n[procedure (ii)] is of a higher quality than that resulting from the L\u00f6wdin orthogonalization\nin k-space [procedure (i)].\nIn Fig. 12 we show the DOS as constructed via procedure (ii) with parameters extracted from different Au and Al\nspheres with 141 to 555 atoms. We observe that the DOS seems well converged with respect to Rsphere both for Au\nand Al for the largest spherical clusters Au429 and Al555 .\n3.\n\nTransformation of electrode parameters under rotations\n\nWe assume that two coordinate systems are connected by the rotation \u033a, where ~r\u2032 = \u033a~r.

In this work only s, p, and d basis functions are used, and\nhence we restrict ourselves to l = 0, 1, and 2. Since s functions just depend on the radius, \u03c8 0 (~r) = \u03c8 0 (r), we have\nD0 (\u033a) = 1.\n\n(B9)\n\nFor l = 1 there are three p functions, p1 = px = f1 (r)x, p2 = py = f1 (r)y, and p3 = pz = f1 (r)z, with a certain radial\nP3\ndependence f1 (r).74 Exploiting \u033a\u22121 = \u033aT , we obtain p\u2032i = j=1 pj \u033aji .

It is easy to show the positive-semidefiniteness of \u0393L , necessary for the determination of both r and t [Eq. (4)].\nThe orbital contributions are obtained by summing over all the basis functions of a certain angular symmetry: px , for\nexample, results from a sum over all the px functions of the basis set, and p is the sum over the px , py , and pz components.\nNote that the Grij are the contravariant components of Gr .76,77,83,84 In the conventional tensor formulation they would be\nwritten (Gr )ij , but in our simplified notation no distinction between co- and contravariant components is being made.\nWe assume that all basis functions are real-valued and that Y is a local single-particle operator h~r| Y |~r\u2032 i = Y (~r)\u03b4(~r \u2212 ~r\u2032 ).\nThe overlap and Kohn-Sham fock operator of DFT are of this form.\n\n\f"}
