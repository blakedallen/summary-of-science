Moreover, comparison of \u03bcSR spectra between GN-(S) and GN-(R) suggests that\nthey are a pair of complete optical isomers in terms of both crystallographic and magnetic\nstructure. Possibility of magnetic chirality in such a pair is discussed.\nKEYWORDS: molecule-based magnets, chiral symmetries, magnetism, \u03bcSR\n\nMagneto-optical activity bears a strong phenomenological resemblance to natural (conventional) optical activity in many respects. Both represent a difference in\nabsorption and refraction between left and right circularly polarized light, where the latter occurs in media\nhaving crystallographic chirality while the former in media subject to magnetic field parallel to the wave vector of the light. The two effects, however, have completely different origins. Natural optical activity is a result of nonlocal optical response in media that lack mirror symmetry, whereas magneto-optical activity results\nfrom the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by a magnetic field. In recent years, optical and magnetic properties of molecule-based magnets have attracted much interests because of their transparency for light and their\napplication. Especially, in the case of a magnet with\nnon-centrosymmetric structure, it is expected that both\nspace-inversion and time-reversal symmetry breaking occurs simultaneously. Moreover, when a magnet is characterized by chiral structure, the magnetic structure of\nthe crystal is expected to induce chiral spin structure.\nWagniere and Mejer theoretically predicted that chiral magnets (i.e., those in which the magnetic moments\ntake a chiral structure) shows magneto-chiral dichroism\n(MChD) effect besides the above two effects.1 (Note that\nthe presence of chirality in the crystallographic structure\nhas no direct relevance to that in the magnetic structure.)\nWhile the natural and magneto-optical activities are effective over polarized light, the characteristic of MChD\nis that it occurs over ordinary light.

Since\nMChD effect depends on the bulk magnetization, relatively large effect may be expected in chiral magnets\ncompared with paramagnetic compounds.\nSince molecule-based magnets have a flexibility in the\ndesign of molecular building blocks and their intermolecular structure including dimensionality, they are open\nto enormous possibilities to create new magneto-optical\nmaterials. As a matter of fact, several optically chiral\nmagnets (which are simply called \"chiral magnets\" regardless of magnetic chirality) have been synthesized as\noptically active magnetic materials in the recent years.3\u20138\nOne of these new molecule-based materials is a twodimensional chiral magnet of a green needle-shaped crystals, [Cr(CN)6 ][Mn(S or R)-pnH(H2 O)](H2 O) ((S or R)pn:(S or R)-1,2-diaminopropane, abbreviated as green\nneedles or GN-(S or R)). (Note that (S)-pn and (R)pn are the optical isomers.) The crystal structure of\nthis compound is indexed on the basis of an orthorhombic unit cell with a space group P 21 21 21 , and lattice\nconstants a, b and c are estimated to be 7.6280(17)\u00c5,\n14.510(3)\u00c5 and 14.935(3)\u00c5, respectively. There are twodimensional planes consisting of Mn and Cr stacking\nalong c axis. Both zero-field cooled and field cooled magnetization with a low applied field (5 Oe) indicate a magnetic order below 38 K. The saturated magnetization at\n5 K is about 2 \u03bcB . This value is in good agreement with\nthe theoretical value of antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr3+ and Mn2+ ions. These results suggest that\nGN-(S) is a ferrimagnet in which Cr3+ and Mn2+ spins\nare antiparallel on a axis. The most interesting issue associated with this compound is whether or not it has\nany chirality in the magnetic structure, which is suggested by the enhanced magnetic circular dichroism ef-\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nKazuki Ohishi, et al.\n\nLetter\n\nfect near TC ,5 by the MChD effect, and magnetizationinduced second harmonic generation (MSHG) effect in\nGN-(S) and GN-(R),9 and also by a theoretical study.10\nIn order to investigate the local structure of magnetically ordered phase which might be missed by neutron\npowder diffraction (NPD) measurements due to a large\nbackground from hydrogen atoms,11 we have performed\nmuon spin rotation and relaxation (\u03bcSR) measurements\non GN-(S) and GN-(R).\nIn this Letter, we show that there are four muon spin\nprecession signals under zero-external field below TC , indicating the appearance of a long-range magnetic order\nand associated multiple muon stopping sites. The internal fields at the muon sites in GN-(S) estimated from\nthe muon precession frequencies are consistent with the\nmagnetic dipolar field which is estimated from an average magnetic structure suggested by the NPD measurement. A reasonable set of muon stopping sites are identified near the cyano-bridges without introducing any local modulation of magnetic moments. In addition, \u03bcSR\nmeasurements in the enantiomer, GN-(R), indicates that\nthere is no effective difference in the local magnetic structure from that in GN-(S). This is consistent with the\npresence of a magnetic chirality which, if it exists, should\nbe in conjunction with crystallographic chirarity, thereby\nsuggesting that the MChD and MSHG effects in this\ncompound would have closer relevance to the possible\nabsence of inversion symmetry in the magnetic structure.\nThe GN-(S) and GN-(R) samples used in this study\nwere obtained by chemical reaction in a solution of\nK3 [Cr(CN6 )], Mn(ClO4 )2 , (S)-pn*2HCl or (R)-pn*2HCl\nand KOH. For the \u03bcSR experiment, a beam of nearly\n100% polarized muons with an incident energy of 4 MeV\nwas focused on a target sample. After stopping almost\ninstantaneously at interstitial sites, each muon spin exhibits the Larmor precession under an internal field B\nwith a frequency 2\u03c0f = \u03b3\u03bc B (\u03b3\u03bc = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 135.54 MHz/T).\nWhen the muon decays, an energetic positron is emitted\npreferentially along the muon spin direction. As a result,\nthe accumulated positron time histograms allow one to\nmonitor the time evolution of muon spin. \u03bcSR measurements under zero field (ZF-\u03bcSR) were conducted at the\nMuon Science Laboratory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK-MSL), Japan and at the TriUniversity Meson Facility (TRIUMF), Canada. Powder\nsamples with a net amount of about 0.7 g were mounted\non a thick silver sample holder (at KEK-MSL) or on a\nthin sheet of mylar film (at TRIUMF, where one can\nobtain background free spectra) and loaded to the 4 He\ngas flow cryostat. ZF-\u03bcSR measurements were mainly\nperformed at temperatures between 2 K and room temperature, and additional measurements were performed\nabove TC under a transverse field (\u2243 2 mT) to calibrate\nthe instrumental asymmetry and also to check whether\nor not muonium (a muonic analogue of paramagnetic hydrogen atom) was formed in the samples. The dynamics\nof local magnetic fields at the muon sites was investigated by \u03bcSR measurements under a longitudinal field\n(LF-\u03bcSR).12\nFigure 1 shows the time evolution of the decay positron\nasymmetry (which is proportional to the time-dependent\n\nmuon spin polarization Pz (t)) observed in GN-(R) under zero field and a longitudinal field at 294 K. The\nZF-\u03bcSR time spectra exhibits exponential damping, indicating that there is a contribution from local electronic\nmoments besides that from randomly oriented nuclear\nmagnetic moments which give rise to a weak Gaussian\ndamping. Therefore, we assume that the time evolution\nis represented by the sum of diamagnetic and paramagnetic components:\nA0 Pz (t, H) = [A1 + A2 exp(\u2212\u03bb(H)t)]GKT\nz (t, H),\n\u03bb(H) \u2243\n\n2\u03b4e2 \u03bde\n\u03bde2 + \u03b3\u03bc2 H 2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere Ai is the partial asymmetry of each components\n(A1 + A2 = A0 ), GKT\nz (t, H) is the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function13 characterized by the Gaussian damping\nat early times (\u223c exp[\u2212(\u2206t)2 ]), followed by the recovery\nof the polarization to 1/3 when H = 0 (with \u2206 being\nthe rms width of the field distribution arising from the\nnuclear moments), GKT\nz (t, H) also represents the recovery of polarization with increasing H, \u03bb(H) is the relaxation rate due to electronic moments which exert a\nhyperfine field, \u03b4e , with a fluctuation rate, \u03bde . Fitting\nanalysis yields A1 = 0.083 and A2 = 0.147 (their ratio\nA1 /A2 \u2243 3/5), and \u2206 = 0.3(2) \u03bcs\u22121 , \u03bb(0) = 0.40(1) \u03bcs\u22121\nand \u03bb(100mT) = 0.14 \u03bcs\u22121 . In order to confirm the presence of two components, we have performed transverse\nfield (TF-) \u03bcSR measurements under a field of 1 T. As\nshown in the inset of Fig. 1, the fast Fourier transform\nof the TF-\u03bcSR spectrum has two peaks. The fractional\nyield of these two peaks is consistent with that of ZF- and\nLF-\u03bcSR results, A1 and A2 . While it is known that the\nmuon gyromagnetic ratio is often subject to modification\nby the formation of muonium in insulating compounds,\nthe observed peak frequencies in Fig. 1 inset indicate that\nno such modification occurs in those samples.\nThe relaxation rate \u03bb gradually increases with decreasing temperature, which is followed by the appearance of\nspontaneous muon spin precession signals below 38.5 K\nin the GN-(S) specimen. Figure 2 shows the ZF-\u03bcSR\ntime spectra near TC and those at the lowest temperature. They unambiguously demonstrate that the system\nfalls into the state of a long-range magnetic order below\nTC . Consequently, the data are analyzed by the following\nfunction;\nA0 Pz (t) =\n\nn\nX\n\nKT\nosc\nAosc\ni Gz (t) exp(\u2212\u03bbi t) cos(2\u03c0fi t + \u03c6)\n\ni=1\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nnon \u0393\n+ Anon GKT\nt)\nz (t) exp \u2212(\u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Aosc\nand Anon are the partial asymmetry\nof oscili\nP\nlating and non-oscillating components ( Aosc\n+\nAnon =\ni\nand\nA0 ), fi is the muon spin precession frequency, \u03bbosc\ni\n\u03bbnon are the relaxation rate, and \u0393 is the power of the\nexponent. As mentioned later, we analyzed the data with\nn = 5 above 30 K, and n = 4 below 30 K.\nThe temperature dependence of f1 is shown in Fig. 3.\nIt exhibits a sharp reduction with increasing temperature\ntowards TC , where the oscillating component disappears\naround 39.5 K.

These indices suggest that three-dimensional (3D)\ninteraction is dominant in this system. (e.g., \u03b2 = 0.38\nfor 3D Heisenberg magnets) The fast Fourier transform\nspectrum at 5.5 K is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. As\nshown in Figs. 2 and 3 inset, the precession signal primarily consists of at least four components (shown by\nmarkers in Fig. 3 inset). In particular, it is inferred from\nthe time spectrum at 38.5 K in Fig. 2 that there is an additional high frequency component just below TC with a\nfrequency f5 \u2243 92.6(5) MHz. Unfortunately, it turns out\nthat this component is not observed below 30 K probably because of the increased frequency that exceeds the\ncurrent time resolution (\u223c a few ns) at lower temperatures. Note that a peak seen in the inset of Fig. 3 at\n3 MHz is not a precession signal but one with a fast relaxation. Their amplitudes at 5.5 K are deduced as Aosc\n1 =\n= 0.004(1)\n= 0.002, Aosc\n= 0.021(2), Aosc\n0.011(2), Aosc\n4\n3\n2\nand Anon = 0.059. In the case of polycrystalline samples, it is predicted that Anon /A0 is close to 1/3, corresponding to the probability that the direction of internal\nmagnetic field is parallel to the initial muon spin direction. However, the observed value of Anon /A0 is slightly\nsmaller than 1/3 (where A0 = 0.23 at ambient temperature), suggesting a fractional loss of initial polarization\ndue to some unknown process (e.g., muonium formation\nat low temperatures). More importantly, A0 is considerably reduced from the value observed at ambient temperature, which is also consistent with the loss of muon\npolarization at the initial stage of muon implantation.\nAs suggested by the spectrum near TC , the missing part\nof the asymmetry may be attributed to the precession\nsignal(s) which might exhibit unresolved fast precession\nor relaxation.\nWe have also performed ZF- and LF-\u03bcSR measurements in the optical isomer, GN-(R). As found in Fig. 2\n(b), the ZF-\u03bcSR spectra observed below TC are virtually identical with those in GN-(S). A procedure of fitting analysis similar to that for GN-(S) has been applied\nto those data, and components with four different frequencies were identified. The temperature dependence\nof f1GNR is shown in Fig. 3 (by open triangle), which\nexhibits perfect agreement with that of GN-(S). Thus,\nthe comparison of the results in GN-(S) with those in\nGN-(R) indicates that they are magnetically equivalent\nin the atomic scale.\nIt is suggested by the results of NPD11 that the magnetic structure of GN-(S) is that of noncollinear ferrimagnet with the magnetic (Shubnikov) space group\nP 21 2\u20321 2\u20321 , and that the magnetic moments of Cr and Mn\natoms are mutually antiparallel along a direction near\nthe a axis with their moment size being 3.84 \u03bcB and\n5.88 \u03bcB , respectively. Since the electronic Cr and Mn\nmoments are ordered below TC , the observation of multi-\n\n3\n\nple components in the precession signals under zero field\nindicates that there are multiple muon sites. Provided\nthat the local field felt by muon is predominantly due to\nmagnetic dipole field Hdip , we have\nHdip = A\u03b1\u03b2\ndip \u03bci\nA\u03b1\u03b2\ndip =\n\n\u0013\nX 1 \u0012 3\u03b1i \u03b2i\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n\u03b1\u03b2\nri3\nri2\ni\n\n(\u03b1, \u03b2 = x, y, z),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A\u03b1\u03b2\ndip is the dipole tensor. The sum is over the contribution of the i-th Cr3+ and Mn2+ ions which have\nmagnetic moments \u03bci at a distance ri = (xi , yi , zi )\nfrom the muon. We can identify the possible muon\nsite by comparing the observed internal field (2\u03c0fi /\u03b3\u03bc )\nand that calculated by the above form with the orientation and moment size of Cr and Mn ions determined by NPD measurements.11 As noted earlier,\nwe have observed four frequencies below TC , f1 =\n45.94(20) MHz, f2 = 23.89(13) MHz, f3 = 20.39(8) MHz\nand f4 = 17.27(12) MHz, yielding the respective local\nmagnetic field at muon sites, B1 = 338.9(1) mT, B2 =\n176.3(1.0) mT, B3 = 150.4(6) mT and B4 = 127.4(9) mT\nat the lowest temperature. The comparison strongly suggests that all the muon sites are located near the cyanobridges. This is also supported by the fact that the cyanobase is negatively charged and thereby reduce the electrostatic energy associated with the positive charge of\nmuons. Figure 4 shows the primary candidates for the\nmuon stopping sites for each frequency.\nThe fact that ZF-\u03bcSR spectra yields reasonable muon\nsite assignment indicates that the average magnetic\nstructure suggested by NPD (based on the assumption\nthat the muon sites are correctly identified) is close to the\nactual magnetic structure without local modulation. The\neffectively identical \u03bcSR results in GN-(S) and GN-(R)\nsuggests that the stopping sites of muons are the same\nin both two samples. As illustrated in Figs. 5a) and 5b),\nthis also suggests that all of the Cr and Mn moments\nare in the opposite direction with each other between\nGN-(R) and GN-(S); otherwise the inversion of crystallographic structure without magnetic structure (as shown\nin Fig. 5c) would yield different internal fields at the\nrespective muon sites. More specifically, a mirror conversion of ri with reference to xy-plane, ri\u2217 = (xi , yi , \u2212zi ),\non the dipole tensor leads to the change in the sign of\nzy\nsome components (e.g., Azx\ndip , Adip ). As a result, the sum\nin eq. (4) yields different values between the pair of enantiomers. Thus, we conclude that GN-(R) and GN-(S)\ngive rise to a complete pair of mirror images in both\ncrystallographic and magnetic structures. Provided that\nCr and Mn moments have a small degree of non-collinear\ncharacter due, for example, to the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya\ninteraction, this immediately leads to a possibility that\nthe system has a chirality in the magnetic structure:\nthe Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction is in conjunction\nwith the crystal structure and thus the associated noncollinear spin structure would gives rise to the magnetic\nchirality.10 Our observation is consistent with the presence of such a chiral magnetic structure conjugating between GN-(R) and GN-(S).\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nKazuki Ohishi, et al.\n\nLetter\n\nIn summary, we have performed \u03bcSR measurements in\npolycrystalline samples of GN-(S) and GN-(R) in order\nto elucidate the local magnetic properties. Muon precession signals were observed under zero field below TC\nin both samples, indicating the presence of long-range\nferrimagnetic order which is close to the average magnetic structure suggested by the result of neutron powder\ndiffraction. The identical \u03bcSR results obtained in GN-(S)\nand GN-(R) indicate that they are a pair of complete optical isomer in terms of both crystallographic and magnetic structure.\nWe would like to thank the staff of TRIUMF and KEK\nfor their technical support during the experiments.
