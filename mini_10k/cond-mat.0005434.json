We attribute the T dependence of \u03c7's\nand \u03c1c to the anomalous (pseudogapped) density-of-states (DOS) in high-Tc\ncuprates. Furthermore, the anisotropy in the T dependence of \u03c7's is universal,\ni.e., \u03c7c \u221d 1.6\u03c7ab , showing that there is only a single T -dependent component\nin the \u03c7's. This implies that the Curie-like behavior (d\u03c7/dT < 0) observed in\noverdoped samples is also caused by a DOS effect.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fAlthough in recent years a lot of evidence for the pseudogap phenomenon in high-Tc\ncuprates has been obtained, there is still no consensus about when (at what temperatures) it\nopens [1]. This is mainly because of our incomplete understanding of the T dependence of the\nuniform susceptibility \u03c7. For example, in the La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 system, it is known that \u03c7 first\nincreases, takes a broad maximun, and then decreases from some characteristic temperature\n(here defined as T\u03c7\u2217 ) with decreasing temperature and T\u03c7\u2217 decreases with increasing doping (Sr\ncontent) [2]. D. C. Johnston has interpreted this as the sum of two-dimensional (2D) S=1/2\nsquare-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnetism and T -independent Pauli paramagnetism [2].\nRecently, there has been proposed a model based on the mode-mode coupling theory of\nspin fluctuations in 2D metals with a technically nested Fermi surface, which explains the\nT dependence as a crossover from the localized to itinerant spin fluctuations [3]. In those\npictures, the gradual decrease in \u03c7 is not attributed to the formation of the pseudogap.\nOn the other hand, J. W. Loram et al. have shown from susceptibility and high-resolution\nspecific heat measurements that the pseudogap is developed below T\u03c7\u2217 in the YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4\n[4] and La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 systems [5]. Similar results have been reported from NMR Knight\nshift measurements [6]. Up to now, we have not had a unified description of the T /doping\ndependence of \u03c7, that is the pseudogap-like behavior at low dopings and Curie-like behavior\nat high dopings.\nSeveral characteristic temperatures are thought to indicate the opening of the pseudogap.\nIn the case of YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 , T\u03c1\u2217c coincides with T\u03c1\u2217a [7] as well as T\u03c7\u2217 , where T\u03c1\u2217c and T\u03c1\u2217a are the\ntemperatures below which out-of-plane resistivity \u03c1c (T ) shows typical semiconductive upturn\nand in-plane resistivity \u03c1a (T ) shows a deviation from high-temperature T -linear behavior.\nThis supports the view that the characteristic change in \u03c1a (T ), \u03c1c (T ), and \u03c7(T ) comes solely\nfrom the opening of the pseudogap. However, in Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 , we have previously\npointed out that T\u03c1\u2217c and T\u03c1\u2217a are different [8]. Therefore, examining the above hypothesis\nwith materials other than YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 is important for understanding the meaning of\nthe T \u2217 's. Recently, K. Ishida et al. have found from their NMR measurement [9] that\nT \u2217 (the peak in 1/T1 T ), TK\u2217 (the steep decrease in the 63 Cu Knight shift) and T\u03c1\u2217a follow\nthe same doping dependence. They have also noticed that TmK (the gradual decrease in\nthe Knight shift from a constant and which thus corresponds to our T\u03c7\u2217 ) follows a different\ndoping dependence. They attribute TK\u2217 to the pseudogap and TmK to a signature for the\ndevelopment of AF-spin correlations [3]. There has been up to now, however, no systematic\nstudy on the anisotropic susceptibilities \u03c7ab (T ) (H \u22a5 c), \u03c7c (T ) (H k c) and \u03c1c (T ) for the\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 system.\nSingle crystals were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method with\na feed rod of Bi2.1 Sr1.9 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 . To control \u03b4 precisely, we first made the PO2 \u2212 T equilibrium phase diagram of a Bi2.1 Sr1.9 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 single crystal for various \u03b4 using a thermogravimetric measurment. The samples were then annealed under the corresponding oxygen\npartial pressures at 600 \u25e6 C for 20\u223c30 h, after which, in order to suppress high-temperature\ndisorder that causes the Curie-Weiss behavior, they were slowly cooled to 300\u223c400 \u25e6 C while\nkeeping the equilibrium oxygen pressures. Finally, they were rapidly quenched [8]. Heavily\noverdoped samples with Tc \u224860 K were made by high O2 pressure (400 atm) annealing at\n500 \u25e6 C for 50 h using a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) furnace. The \u03b4 for the HIP-treated\nsample was estimated as \u22480.3 from our equilibrium phase diagram [8]. We attained high\naccuracy in the measurements by using the reciprocating sample option (RSO: absolute sen2\n\n\fsibility \u22655 x 10\u22128 emu) of a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) magnetometer as well as by using large crystals (sample weight \u224820 mg).\nThe magnetic susceptibilities \u03c7c (T ) and \u03c7ab (T ) under H=5 T of the Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4\nsingle crystals with various oxygen contents (\u03b4) are shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively.\nThe overall magnitude of \u03c7c (T ) and \u03c7ab (T ) increases with increasing \u03b4. We interpret this\nin terms of an increase in the density-of-states (DOS) near the Fermi level with carrier\ndoping. The susceptibilities in the underdoped (\u03b4=0.22, Tc =82 K) and optimum-doped\n(\u03b4=0.25, Tc =89 K) samples monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature. For the\nslightly overdoped sample (\u03b4=0.26, Tc =86 K), they are almost constant at high temperatures\nand gradually decrease from a characteristic temperature T\u03c7\u2217 [shown by the arrow in Fig.\n1(a)] upon cooling. A further increase in \u03b4 causes a shift of T\u03c7\u2217 to lower temperatures,\nwhereas above T\u03c7\u2217 the susceptibilities prominently decrease with increasing temperature.\nT\u03c7\u2217 is estimated as 200, 175, and 135 K for \u03b4=0.26, 0.27, and 0.28, respectively. Here, T\u03c7\u2217\nwas determined as the temperature at which \u03c7c deviates 2 % from the high temperature\nT -linear behavior. The difference in the absolute value between \u03c7c and \u03c7ab may come from\nthe anisotropic Van Vleck paramagnetism of the Cu2+ ions, which is almost completely\nT -independent [10].\nThe out-of-plane resistivity \u03c1c (T ) for optimum and overdoped (0.26\u2264\u03b4\u22640.3, 86 K\u2265Tc \u226560\nK) Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 single crystals is shown in Fig. 2. The \u03c1c in a optimum-doped sample\n(\u03b4=0.25, Tc =89 K) shows semiconductive behavior in all temperature regions measured.\nWith increasing \u03b4, the overall magnitude of \u03c1c decreases and the characteristic temperature\nT\u03c1\u2217c (shown by the arrow in Fig. 2) for the onset of upturn appears. If T\u03c1\u2217c is defined in the\nsame manner as T\u03c7\u2217 , it can be estimated as 185, 165, and 130 K for \u03b4=0.26, 0.27, and 0.28,\nrespectively. For the heavily overdoped sample (\u03b4\u22480.3, Tc =60 K), \u03c1c (T ) shows no upturn\nbehavior, suggesting the pseudogap completely vanishes at this doping level.\nThe above obtained T\u03c7\u2217 and T\u03c1\u2217c together with several other characteristic temperatures,\nincluding Tc , are plotted as a function of carrier concentration p in Fig. 3. Here p was\nestimated from Tc using the empirical relation Tc /Tc,max = 1 \u2212 82.6(p \u2212 0.16)2 [11]. T\u03c7\u2217 and\nT\u03c1\u2217c coincides for each p. Unlike YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 , which may change its dimensionality from two\n(2D) to three (3D) upon doping, the Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 stays in 2D for all doping levels. We\nhave previously shown that the \u03c1c in the Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 system is governed by a simple\ntunneling process [12]. Then \u03c1c should reflect the in-plane DOS. Since the magnitude of spin\nsusceptibility also reflects the DOS, the coincidence of T\u03c7\u2217 and T\u03c1\u2217c simply indicates that the\npseudogap opens at these temperatures. This is different from the explanation where the\ngradual decrease in \u03c7 is attributed to the development of AF-spin correlations. It should be\nnoted, however, that the pseudogap behavior at the doping level of \u03b4=0.28 (p=0.193) may not\nbe distinguishable from the superconductive DOS fluctuation effect [13]. We have confirmed\nthis pseudogap opening at T\u03c7\u2217 /T\u03c1\u2217c by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) (shown as\n\u2217\nTtunnel\nin Fig. 3) [14,15], although we recently recognized that there was a little shift in the\ndoping level due to oxygen depletion from the surface in the experiment in [14]. Our results\nhere may conflict with the NMR measurement [9] and the angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) [16], which show that the pseudogap opens at around T\u03c1\u2217a ,(shown as\n\u2217\nTK\u2217 and TARP\nES , respectively, in Fig. 3). We could not observe any discontinuous change\nin temperature dependence or anisotropy of the susceptibility at around T\u03c1\u2217a . We point out,\nhowever, that if T \u2217 in [9] is defined as a temperature at which 1/T1 T departs from high3\n\n\ftemperature Curie-Weiss behavior, it will come close to TmK and thus will come close to our\npseudogap phase boundary. A slight dip structure in the DOS, which causes the decrease\nin the susceptibility, may not have been assigned as a gap opening by the ARPES in terms\nof the leading edge analysis. In order to understand the anomaly seen at T\u03c1\u2217a , one may need\nto consider the strongly k-dependent quasiparticle lifetime, or it may be simply unrelated\nto the pseudogap phenomena.\nNext, in order to analyze the T dependence of anisotropic susceptibilities quantitatively,\nwe plotted \u03c7c (T ) vs. \u03c7ab (T ) with an implicit parameter T for several doping levels (Fig. 4).\nHere, we assume that the T dependence comes from spin susceptibilities of the doped CuO2\nplane. Each of the \u03c7c (T ) vs. \u03c7ab (T ) plots [Figs. 4(a), (b) and (c)] shows the same linear\nrelation, i. e., \u03c7c \u221d 1.6\u03c7ab , except near Tc (\u2264140 K). This implies that the spin susceptibility\nhas a single component with the ratio of anisotropic g-factors, (gc /ga )2 =1.6, and thus the\nCurie-like explanation for the \u03c7 of overdoped samples may be excluded. This is because it\nis unlikely that the localized paramagnetic centers, which could have appeared additively\nin the overdoped state, have accidentally the same anisotropy as the main spin component.\nThis single-component hypothesis is consistent with NMR experiments [17] and ensures\nthat we are actually measuring the intrinsic spin susceptibility. In Fig. 3, we included the\ntemperatures at which the deviation from the linear scaling becomes evident, Tscf . Since\nthe Tscf scales with Tc , it is considered to be the onset temperature of Aslamasov-Larkin\n(AL)-type superconductive fluctuation, which is extremely anisotropic in high-Tc cuprates\n[10].\nAs already mentioned, we consider that the T dependence of \u03c7 for underdoped samples\nis caused by the pseudogap opening, which has been evidenced by STS [14,15,18,19]. Then,\nit is natural to consider that the Curie-like behavior of \u03c7 for overdoped samples is also\ncaused by a DOS effect, since the system is expected to be more Fermi-liquid like upon\ndoping. One such possibility is an van-Hove singularity (vHs), whose existence has been\nconfirmed by ARPES at somewhat below the Fermi energy (\u03b5F ) for a slightly overdoped\nsample [20]. The vHs is considered to grow and come near the \u03b5F with increasing doping.\nHere, we assume simply\nthe Pauli paramagnetism for the single-component spin susceptiR\n2 \u221e\nbility, \u03c7pauli = \u03bcB \u2212\u221e N(\u03b5)(\u2212\u2202f (\u03b5)/\u2202\u03b5)d\u03b5, where N(\u03b5) is the DOS and f (\u03b5) is the Fermi\nfunction. Since \u03c7pauli reflects the thermally averaged DOS near \u03b5F , when one takes into\naccount the anomalous energy-dependent DOS (pseudogap and vHs) and its doping evolution, it will explain the \u03c7 observed. This kind of interpretation was first proposed by J. W.\nLoram et al. [5] and later asserted by G. V. M. Williams et al. [21]. Our data here support\ntheir interpretation from a different point of view.\nThe assumption of the Pauli paramagnetism for the spin susceptibility enables us to\nestimate the pseudogap value. Here in the underdoped state, the energy independent background DOS, N0 , was assumed (the vHs may sit far below \u03b5F and be smeared out). For\nthe pseudogap, the BCS-type DOS (Dynes formula)\nwith the d-wave symmetry gap was\nq\nR 2\u03c0\nassumed, N(\u03b5)/N0 = 0 (d\u03b8/2\u03c0)Re[| \u03b5 \u2212 i\u0393 | / (\u03b5 \u2212 i\u0393)2 \u2212 (\u2206 cos(2\u03b8))2 ], where \u0393 is the\nquasiparticle scattering rate, which was assumed here as 2kB T in a consistent way with the\ntransport data, and \u2206 is a maximum d-wave gap, the temperature dependence of which\nwas neglected. Then we can fit the experimental spin susceptibility \u03c7iso\nspin (T ) [22] by the\ncalculated ones with a free parameter \u2206 as shown in Fig. 5. The pseudogap value \u2206 was estimated as 65\u00b13 and 48\u00b13 meV for the underdoped (\u03b4=0.22) and optimum doped (\u03b4=0.25)\n4\n\n\fsamples, respectively. These pseudogap values coincide with our direct STS measurements\n[14,15] and, possibly, with the \"high energy gap\" recently suggested by photoemission spectroscopy [23], but are larger than the superconducting gap (20 meV\u2264\u2206\u226445 meV) obtained\nby ARPES/STS [14,15,16,18,19].\nIn conclusion, the experimentally obtained pseudogap phase boundary (T\u03c7\u2217 and T\u03c1\u2217c ) is\nnot a smooth extrapolation of the Tc boundary of the heavily overdoped state, rather, it\nseems to cross the Tc boundary at a slightly overdoped level (Fig. 3). This result together\nwith the estimated larger pseudogap compared to superconducting gap suggests the two\ngaps are different in origin, although there are many arguments that the pseudogap is a\nprecursor of the d-wave superconducting gap [18].\nWe would like to thank Professors M. Kohmoto and M. Suzuki for helpfull discussions\nand Dr. H. Shibata for extending the use of the HIP facility.\n\n5\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\nB.
