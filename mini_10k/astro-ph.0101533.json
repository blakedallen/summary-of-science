These phenomena and a zoo of astrophysical\nobjects will be the targets of the next generation multi-national telescope facilities.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u03b3-ray astronomy has traditionally been thought of as an extension of X-ray\nsatellite experiments into the \u03b3-ray regime. An all-sky survey by the most\nrecent satellite experiment, EGRET (1991 - 2000), increased the catalogue of\ndiscrete astronomical sources of 20 MeV - 20 GeV \u03b3-rays from 4 to 271. As a\nresult, the question of what happens at energies beyond 20 GeV has gained\nmomentum. Since the \u03b3-ray count rate from these sources is a steeply falling\nfunction of photon energy, a sensitive area four orders of magnitude greater\nthan EGRET's is needed for reasonable counting statistics in the Very High\nEnergy (200 GeV - 50 TeV) \u03b3-ray regime. To attain this we must make the\nabsorbing atmosphere work for us as our calorimeter.\nIn the early 1960s, it was suggested that cosmic photons at energies of\n\u223c1 TeV from point sources could be detected via \u010cerenkov radiation, produced by the e\u2212 e+ particle airshowers which they initiated in the atmosphere.\nThe main drawback of this method for the study of \u03b3-rays was the huge background of airshowers produced by charged cosmic rays. It was essential to\nbe able to discriminate between the two classes of primary particles. Success\ncame in 1989 with the introduction of the \u010cerenkov imaging technique, by\nwhich the Crab Nebula, the remnant of the supernova of AD 1054, was firmly\nestablished as a source of TeV \u03b3-rays.17 Current atmospheric \u010cerenkov detec-\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n1\n\n\ftors operate either by imaging, as described here, or by wavefront sampling.14\nAlmost a century after their discovery, the origin of hadronic cosmic rays\nremains a mystery. Their arrival directions at Earth provide no clue as to their\nsource since their paths are contorted by galactic magnetic fields; they form\nan apparently isotropic background for \u010cerenkov telescopes. The hadronic\ncosmic ray distribution throughout the galaxy should be traceable through\ntheir interactions with matter and subsequent \u03b3-ray emission, for example\nvia \u03c0 \u25e6 decay. The remnants of supernova explosions are generally believed to\nsupply the cosmic ray particles of energies up to Z \u00d7 1014 eV in our galaxy,\nsince little else could provide sufficient energy. Such objects are therefore\nprime targets for VHE \u03b3-ray astronomers seeking the cosmic ray accelerators.\nLess than 1% of the VHE \u03b3-ray sky has been mapped by the most sensitive\nmeans and there are about a dozen recognised VHE \u03b3-ray sources. Some are\nactive galaxies, which emit dramatic flares during which the count rate of\nVHE \u03b3-rays doubles on a timescale of hours. 10 15 The \u03b3-ray luminosity and\nflare timescale, together with near simultaneous X-ray and optical emission\nepisodes, allow us to estimate the magnetic field strength and Doppler factor\nat the source, indicating emission from highly relativistic plasma jets.\n2\n\nThe Imaging Atmospheric \u010cerenkov Technique\n\nTypically about 0.01% of the energy of an incoming cosmic \u03b3-ray is expected\nto be dissipated as \u010cerenkov light. This illuminates a disc of radius \u223c125 m\non the ground for the \u223c10 ns equivalent to the lifetime of the particle shower.\nIn essence, an atmospheric \u010cerenkov telescope acts as a \"light bucket\", a\nsingle mirrored dish which reflects a fraction of the \u010cerenkov light pool onto\na camera in the focal plane.\n2.1\n\nTelescope Construction\n\nThe largest single dish now in operation is the 10 m diameter telescope at the\nWhipple Observatory in Arizona, shown in figure 1. This will be surpassed\nby the 17 m diameter MAGIC Telescope in the latter half of 2001. Atmospheric ozone absorbs much of the UV component of the \u010cerenkov flash so\nthat the light intensity peaks at around 300 nm, for which a high reflectivity\ncan be achieved with an anodized aluminium coating on a glass or lightweight\naluminium substrate. Current telescopes use cameras of several hundred closepacked photomultiplier tubes to record images of the \u010cerenkov light flashes.\nThese are digitized and subsequently parameterized in terms of brightness,\nshape, orientation and angular position. The ability to derive an arrival di-\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1. The Whipple Observatory 10 m imaging atmospheric \u010cerenkov telescope.\n\nrection, primary energy and primary particle type (\u03b3-ray, cosmic ray nucleon\nor local muon) from these images is dependent upon both the accuracy of our\nmodels of high energy particle cascade development, and our knowledge of the\nvariable state of the calorimetric volume of atmosphere above the telescope.\n2.2\n\nNature's Challenges\n\n\u010cerenkov telescopes are pointed instruments viewing a few square degrees of\nsky. \u03b3-rays from an astronomical object are expected to produce compact\n\u010cerenkov images pointing towards the position of that object in the field\nof view. Cosmic ray induced airshowers develop sub-showers as a result of\nthe relatively high transverse momentum of hadronic daughter particles and\nshould therefore produce identifiably irregular \u010cerenkov images. When attempting to lower a telescope's energy threshold, by reducing the threshold\nlight level for an event to be recorded, individual muons created in hadronic\nshowers which reach the level of the detector (as seen in figure 2) can mimic\n\u03b3-ray events. Whilst the \u010cerenkov light ring from a muon striking the centre\nof the mirror is clearly recognisable (in figure 3), a small \"muon arc\" image\nwill be recorded if the impact point is several metres from the telescope. One\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 2. Simulated air showers initiated by vertical 1 TeV \u03b3-ray (left) and proton (right)\nprimaries.

Filled circles scale with no. of ADC counts in a channel.\n\nway to eradicate this background is to require that a \u03b3-ray like image has\nbeen simultaneously observed by multiple telescopes tracking the same astronomical object. 9 A further source of background noise events is quite simply\nthe fluctuating brightness of the night sky. This can instantaneously result\nin two or three random photomultiplier signals above the fixed discrimination\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n4\n\n\fthreshold, triggering the recording of a false event. A programmable hardware trigger has been developed for the Whipple Telescope which can identify\ncandidate \u010cerenkov events with adjacent pixel signals within 65 ns. 7\nDealing with background light is further complicated by bright stars in\nthe field of view. As objects are tracked across the sky the movement of the\ntelescope places a variable strain on cables and connectors. These must also\nwithstand diurnal and seasonal temperature changes, humidity, wind and an\noccasional loading of snow at high altitudes. Where necessary control connections are made over optical fibre to reduce the likelihood of lightning damage.\nPrototype, low cost, analogue fibre optic links have been developed to transmit photomultiplier signals to data acquisition electronics on the ground. 16\nThese introduce far less signal dispersion than co-axial cable. Keeping the\npulse width narrow allows one to reduce the integration time and hence the\namount of night sky background noise included with the \u010cerenkov signal. 6\nThe use of FADCs for charge digitization can provide not only a better estimate of instantaneous background light levels, but also some information on\nthe time structure of each pulse, a characteristic of the airshower's development and hence a potential clue to the primary particle type.\n3\n3.1\n\nCosmic Particle Accelerators\nGalactic VHE \u03b3-ray Sources\n\nThe non-thermal radiation from the Crab Nebula supernova remnant is well\ndocumented from radio wavelengths through to VHE \u03b3-rays. It is supposed\nthat the central neutron star spinning at 30 Hz is generating a pulsar wind of\nrelativistic electrons. The spectrum, shown in figure 4 is dominated by the\ninteractions of these electrons with the magnetic fields in the gaseous nebula\nand ambient photon fields. Synchrotron emission can account for the curve\nfrom the radio through to satellite \u03b3-ray observations by COMPTEL and\nEGRET at up to 1 GeV. The corresponding electron energies required are from\n10 GeV to 100 TeV as indicated. The VHE \u03b3-ray emission is fitted by a second\ncomponent (dashed curve in figure 4), due to the inverse Compton scattering\nof soft photons up to energies above 10 TeV by relativistic electrons. 1 Effective\nacceleration of particles to beyond 1014 eV is implicit. Given the electron\nspectrum required to generate the VHE \u03b3-ray flux, a local magnetic field\nstrength of \u223c16 nT was deduced from the observed level of X-ray synchrotron\nemission presumed to be due to these same electrons. 12\nThere have been three tentative detections of VHE \u03b3-rays from shelltype supernova remnants which lack a central neutron star dynamo. X-ray\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 4. Nonthermal radiation of the Crab Nebula. The solid and dashed curves are model\nfits of synchrotron and inverse Compton components by Aharonian and Atoyan1 .\n\nobservations of one of these objects, SN 1006, indicate synchrotron emission\nfrom electrons with energies of \u223c100 TeV. The \u03b3-ray flux can therefore be accounted for without invoking \u03b3-ray production as a result of collisions between\nrelativistic protons and the interstellar medium (principally atomic hydrogen)\ne.g. according to p + ISM \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 + X \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 + X. There is still no firm\nevidence for hadronic cosmic ray production at supernova shock fronts.\n3.2\n\n\u03b3-ray Sources at Cosmological Distances\n\nThere are two well-established sources of VHE \u03b3-rays outside our own galaxy,\nobjects known as Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. These are both blazar\ntype active galaxies, at a distance of some 500 million light years, in which\ngravitational accretion of matter onto a central supermassive black hole is\nassumed to be powering an outflow of material in relativistic plasma jets. 8\nThe rapid variability and high luminosity of the VHE \u03b3-ray flux from these\nobjects seems to indicate that the \u03b3-rays are relativistically beamed. Our line\nof sight to each must therefore be such that we happen to be looking straight\ndown one of the jets. For the 15 minute timescale VHE \u03b3-ray variability\nobserved from Markarian 421, causality implies an emission region as small as\nour solar system. 10\nThe multi-wavelength spectra of Markarian 421 and Markarian 501 conform quite well to the two component synchrotron plus electron inverse Comp-\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n6\n\n\fton scattering mechanism proposed for the Crab Nebula. Correlated episodes\nof enhanced emission of \u03b3-ray and optical/UV photons imply that these photons are produced in the same region of the jet. In this case, jet Doppler\nfactors in the range of 2 < \u03b4 > 40 are required to avoid a significant loss\nof VHE \u03b3-rays to pair production with the low energy photons. If the VHE\n\u03b3-rays in fact result from hadronic cascades produced by high energy protons\nin the jet, as proposed by Mannheim 13 and others, then \u03b4 \u2248 10.\nThe cosmic infrared background (CIB) traces the history of star formation\nand galaxy evolution in the early universe. VHE \u03b3-rays from active galaxies\ncan provide a means of probing the CIB. The \u03b3-ray signal will be attenuated\nby pair production: \u03b3V HE + \u03b3IR \u2192 e\u2212 + e+ . Since the attenuation becomes\nmore significant as the \u03b3-ray energy increases, we expect to see a distance\ndependent, high energy cut-off in the VHE spectra of active galaxies. Upper\nlimits on the CIB which are more restrictive than direct measurements in\nthe 0.025 to 0.3 eV range have already been obtained. 5 To establish whether\nspectral cut-offs are due to this effect or are in fact intrinsic to these objects\nmore sensitive instruments are required to extend the source catalogue.\n4\n\nNext Generation Telescopes\n\nSeveral \"next generation\" atmospheric \u010cerenkov observatories are under construction. VERITAS 18 in Arizona, HESS in Namibia and CANGAROO III\nin Australia will be arrays of 10 m diameter class imaging \u010cerenkov telescopes.\nBy viewing each airshower with several telescopes separated by about 100 m,\ngreatly improved angular and energy resolution and an increased collection\narea will be achieved between 100 GeV and 10 TeV. As a single 17 m diameter\ndish, the MAGIC Telescope, on the Canary Island La Palma, will have the\nlowest energy threshold of 30 GeV using a standard photomultiplier camera,\nor 15 GeV if equipped with hybrid GaAsP photocathode photodetectors. 2\n4.1\n\nFundamental Physics\n\nThe greater sensitivity of the planned instruments will improve the chances\nof new detections of active galaxies, the pulsed signatures of objects such as\nthe Crab pulsar and \u03b3-ray bursts. Their angular resolution should enable\nus to identify some of the 170 sources detected with large position errors by\nthe EGRET satellite instrument. In addition, VHE \u03b3-ray observations may\nimprove our view of some fundamental physics phenomena.\nOur current understanding requires the presence of cold dark matter in the\nuniverse to explain certain astrophysical data. The neutralino is a favoured\n\npaper: submitted to World Scientific on October 28, 2018\n\n7\n\n\fdark matter candidate. A concentration of neutralinos towards the centre of\nour galaxy may produce a detectable monoenergetic annihilation line in the\nneutralino mass range of 30 GeV to 3 TeV. 3\n\u03b3-ray observations of distant objects can be searched for the effects of\nquantum gravity. The velocity of light may exhibit an energy dependence\ndue to quantum fluctuations in a gravitational medium, resulting in a time\ndispersion within VHE \u03b3-ray flares. A 15 minute flare from Markarian 421\nhas already been used to place a limit on this effect, 4 which could be vastly\nimproved by instruments sensitive to minute by minute variability.\nLow mass black holes, remnants of inhomogeneities in the early universe,\nshould emit a burst of radiation peaked at around 1 TeV in the final stages\nof their evaporation, according to Halzen et al. 11 In fact, the predicted time\nprofile and energy spectrum depend on whether one follows the standard or\nbootstrap models for the particle spectrum at high energies.\nThese are just a few of the topics in particle physics and astrophysics\nwhich the next generation of imaging \u010cerenkov telescopes may address.
