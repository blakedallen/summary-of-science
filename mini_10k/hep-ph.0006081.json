In particular, the decays D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 and D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7, which are largely suppressed\nin the absence of FSI, are enhanced dramatically by resonant FSI. It is stressed that the effect\nof resonant FSI is negligible for \u03c1+ (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) final states because of the mismatch of the G parity of\n\u03c1+ (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) and the J = 0, I = 1 meson resonance. We argue that a possible gluon-mediated process\nin which two gluons couple directly to the gluonic component of the \u03b7 \u2032 , e.g. the gluonium, rather\nthan to the flavor-singlet \u03b70 , can enhance both modes Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 and Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7, especially the\nformer; that is, this new mechanism can account for the unexpectedly large branching ratio of \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032\nwithout suppressing \u03c1+ \u03b7.\n\n1\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\n\nWe have shown recently in [1] that in the decays of charmed mesons into the final states\ncontaining an \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 , final-state interactions (FSI) in the resonance formation are able to\n0\nenhance B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 ) and B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7) by an order of magnitude. Resonance-induced\ncouple-channel effects will suppress Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 and enhance Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 . Contrary to\n\u2032\n\u22170 \u2032\nD \u2192 P \u03b7 ( ) decays, resonant FSI play only a minor role for D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 ( ) and do not\n\u2032\ncontribute to (D + , Ds+ ) \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) . We argued that it is difficult to understand the observed\nlarge decay rates of the \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03c1+ \u03b7 decay modes of Ds+ simultaneously. FSI are not helpful\ndue to the absence of Ds+ \u2192 P P decays that have much larger decay rates than Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 .\nW -annihilation and a possible production of the \u03b7 \u2032 due to gluon-mediated processes can in\nprinciple enhance B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 ), but, unfortunately, they will also suppress B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7).\nIn [1] we have followed [2] to use the strong reaction matrix K0 together with the unitarity\nconstraint of the S matrix to study the effects of resonant FSI and showed that resonanceinduced FSI amount to modifying, for example, the W -exchange amplitude C in D 0 \u2192\nK\u03c0, K\u03b7, K\u03b7 \u2032 decays by [2]\n1\nC \u2192 C + (C + A)(cos \u03b4ei\u03b4 \u2212 1)\n3\n\n(1.1)\n\nand leaving the other quark-diagram amplitudes intact, where A is an external W -emission\namplitude. In this addendum we will derive the above relation in a rigorous way and find\nthat the modification due to FSI for the W -exchange amplitude as shown in Eq. (1.1) is too\nsmall by a factor of 2.\nIn the present paper we will update the previous analysis [1] by correcting the error\noccurred in Eq. (1.1), discussing its implication and employing the new measurement of\nthe Ds+ lifetime. Moreover, we shall show explicitly that contributions from resonant FSI\n\u2032\nto the decays (D + , Ds+ ) \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) should be negligible, otherwise the predicted branching\nratios will become too large compared to experiment. This is ascribed to the mismatch of\nthe G parity of \u03c1+ (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032) and the J = 0, I = 1 meson resonance. We will also employ the\n0\nmode D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 as an example to demonstrate that resonance-induced FSI, which are\ncrucial for some two-body decays involving one single isospin component, e.g. the final state\ncontaining an \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , play only a minor role compared to isospin FSI for decay modes\ninvolving several different isospin components. We then turn to some possible explanation\nof the unexpectedly large branching ratio of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 . Finally we discuss in detail the\npossible sources of theoretical uncertainties for estimating the effects of resonant FSI.\nII. RESONANT FINAL-STATE INTERACTIONS\n\nThere are several different forms of FSI: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering such\nas quark exchange, resonance formation,* * *, etc. Since FSI are nonperturbative in nature,\nin general it is notoriously difficult to calculate their effects. Nevertheless, the effect of\nresonance-induced coupled-channel FSI can be estimated provided that the mass and the\nwidth of the nearby resonances are known. It appears that the resonance formation of FSI\nvia q q\u0304 resonances is probably the most important one if the final state has only one single\n2\n\n\fisospin component. For previous studies of the effects of resonant FSI in charm decays, see\n[3,2,1,4,5].\nIn the presence of resonances, the decay amplitude of the charmed meson D decaying\ninto two mesons M1 M2 is modified by rescattering through a multiplet of resonances [6]\u2217\nA(D \u2192 Mi Mj )FSI = A(D \u2192 Mi Mj ) \u2212 i\n\n\u0393\nE \u2212 mR + i\u0393/2\n\nX\n\n(r)\n\ncij\n\nr\n\nX\nkl\n\n(r)\u2217\n\nckl A(D \u2192 Mk Ml ), (2.1)\n\n(r)\n\nwhere cij are normalized coupling constants of Mi Mj with the scalar resonance r, obeying\nthe relations\nX\n\n(r) (s)\u2217\n\ncij cij\n\nX\n\n= \u03b4rs ,\n\nij\n\nij\n\n(r)\n\n|cij |2 = 1.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe presence of a resonance shows itself in a characteristic behavior of phase shifts near the\nresonance. For each individual resonant state r, there is an eigenstate of A(D \u2192 Mi Mj )\nwith eigenvalue [6]\ne2i\u03b4r = 1 \u2212 i\n\n\u0393\n,\nmD \u2212 mR + i\u0393/2\n\n(2.3)\n\nin the rest frame of the charmed meson, where mR and \u0393 are the mass and the width of the\nresonance, respectively. Therefore, resonance-induced FSI are amenable technically in terms\nof the physical resonances.\n0\n\n\u22170\n\nA. D 0 \u2192 (K , K )(\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) decays\n\nTo illustrate the effect of FSI in the resonance formation, consider the decays D 0 \u2192 K i Pj\n \u0304 quark content in the charm\nas an example. The only nearby 0+ scalar resonance with (sd)\n0\n0\n0\n\u2217\n\u2212 +\nmass region is r = K0 (1950) and the states K i Pj are K \u03c0 , K \u03c0 0 , K \u03b7, K \u03b7 \u2032 .

Since (e2i\u03b4r \u2212 1) = 2(cos \u03b4r ei\u03b4r \u2212 1),\nwe see that the contribution of resonant FSI to the W -exchange amplitude as given in Eq.\n(1.1) is too small by a factor of 2.\nThe resonance contribution to FSI, which arises mainly from the external W -emission\ndiagram for the decay D 0 \u2192 (K\u03c0)1/2 followed by final-state q q\u0304 resonance, has the same\ntopology as the W -exchange quark diagram. We thus see that even if the short-distance\nW -exchange vanishes, as commonly asserted, an effective long-distance W -exchange still can\nbe induced via FSI in resonance formation.\nConsidering the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing parameterized by\n\u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b78 sin \u03b8 + \u03b70 cos \u03b8,\n\n\u03b7 = \u03b78 cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b70 sin \u03b8,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwith \u03b78 and \u03b70 being SU(3) octet and singlet wave functions respectively, and neglecting the\nW -exchange amplitude C, we obtain [1]\n2i\u03b4r\n\u0011\n\u221a\n0\n\u22121\u0010\nGF\n0 \u2212 + e\n0\n\u221a\nA(D \u2192 K \u03b7) = \u221a Vcs\u2217 Vud a2 X (D \u03b7,K ) + a1 X (D K ,\u03c0 )\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 \u2212 2 2 sin \u03b8 ,\n2\n3 6\n#\n\"\n2i\u03b4\nr\n\u0011\n\u221a\n0\n\u22121\u0010\nGF \u2217\n0 \u2032\n(D 0 K \u2212 ,\u03c0 + ) e\n(D 0 \u03b7\u2032 ,K )\n0\n\u221a\n+ a1 X\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 + 2 2 cos \u03b8 ,\nA(D \u2192 K \u03b7 ) = \u221a Vcs Vud a2 X\n2\n3 6\n0\n\n0\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nand\n4\n\n(2.10)\n\n\f\"\n\n0\u2217\nGF\n0\nA(D \u2192 K \u03b7) = \u221a Vcs\u2217 Vud a2 X (D \u03b7,K )\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22170\n\n\u0010\n\n(D 0 K \u2212\u2217 ,\u03c0 + )\n\n\u0010\n\n(D 0 K \u2212\u2217 ,\u03c0 + )\n\n+ a1 X\n\n+X\n\n(D 0 K \u2212 ,\u03c1+ )\n\n\"\n\n0\u2217\nGF\n0 \u2032\nA(D \u2192 K \u03b7 ) = \u221a Vcs\u2217 Vud a2 X (D \u03b7 ,K )\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22170 \u2032\n\n+ a1 X\n\n+X\n\n(D 0 K \u2212 ,\u03c1+ )\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\ne2i\u03b4r\u2032 \u2212 1 \u0010\n\u221a\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 \u2212 2 2 sin \u03b8 ,\n6 6\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\ne2i\u03b4r\u2032 \u2212 1 \u0010\n\u221a\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 + 2 2 cos \u03b8 , (2.11)\n6 6\n\n#\n\n#\n\nwhere X (DM1 ,M2 ) denotes the factorizable amplitude with the meson M2 being emitted out:\nX (DM1 ,M2 ) = hM2 |(q\u03041 q2 )|0ihM1 |(q\u03043 c)|Di,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwith (q\u03041 q2 ) \u2261 q\u03041 \u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )q2 .

To see how the mechanism of resonant FSI\nworks, notice that the big parentheses in Eqs. (2.10,2.11) reflect the coefficient of the W exchange amplitude. Taking \u03b8 = \u221219.5\u25e6 as a benchmark, the wave functions of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032\nhave the simple expressions [9]:\n1\n1\n\u03b7 = \u221a (u\u016b + dd \u0304 \u2212 ss\u0304),\n\u03b7 \u2032 = \u221a (u\u016b + dd \u0304 + 2ss\u0304).\n(2.14)\n3\n6\n\u221a\nIn Eqs. (2.10,2.11), (cos \u03b8 + 2 2 sin \u03b8) = 0 indicates that there is no intrinsic W -exchange\n\u221a\n0(\u2217)\ndiagram in D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7, while (2 2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8) = 3 shows that D 0 \u2192 K 0(\u2217) \u03b7 \u2032 contains\nthe amplitude 3 C. Since the internal W -emission amplitude is color suppressed, while the\ncontributions from resonant FSI are induced from the external W -emission, it is clear that\n0\nthe decay D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 receives large contributions from FSI in the resonance form, so that\n0\nits decay rate is larger than that of D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7.\nUsing the effective coefficients\na1 = 1.25,\n\na2 = \u22120.51,\n\n(2.15)\n\nthe \u03b7\u2212\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03b8 = \u221222\u25e6 [10], the mass 1945\u00b110\u00b120 MeV and the width 210\u00b134\u00b179\nMeV for the 0+ resonance K0\u2217 (1950), mR = 1830 MeV and \u0393 = 250 MeV for the 0\u2212 resonance\n5\n\n\fK(1830) [11], and various form factors given in [1], the calculated branching ratios are\nexhibited in Table I. We see that in the presence of resonant FSI, the branching ratio of\n0\u2217\n0\u2217\nK \u03b7 \u2032 is enhanced by an order of magnitude, while the decay rate of K \u03b7 is only slightly\n0\n0\nincreased. The \u03b7 \u2032 enhancement for D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 over D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7, which cannot be accounted\nfor in the factorization approach, can be explained in terms of resonance-induced FSI. For\ncomparison, the theoretical predictions by Buccella et al., [3] are also shown in Table I. As\nnoted in passing, the phase in Eq. (3.3) of [3] is too small by a factor of 2.\nIt should be stressed that although resonant FSI can make a dramatic effect on hadronic\ndecays of the charmed mesons containing an \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 , i.e. final states with one single isospin\ncomponent, they are not expected to play the same essential role in the decay channels\ninvolving several different isospin components. A well known example is the decay D 0 \u2192\n0\nK \u03c0 0 with the decay amplitude:\n1\n0 \u2212 +\n\u2212 a1 (e2i\u03b4r \u2212 1)X (D K ,\u03c0 )\n3\n\u0013\u221a \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\n0\n2 \u2212i(\u03b41/2 \u2212\u03b43/2 )\n0\n\u2212\n+\n(D K ,\u03c0 )\n(D 0 \u03c0 0 ,K )\ne\n\u22121 ,\n(2.16)\n+ a1 X\n+ a2 X\n3\n\u221a\n0\n0 0\n0 +\nwhere X (D \u03c0 ,K ) = ifK (m2D \u2212 m2\u03c0 )F0D \u03c0 (m2K )/ 2 and \u03b4i are the isospin phase shifts. In\nnaive factorization with a1,2 = c1,2 + c2,1 /3 and in the absence of any FSI, we find B(D 0 \u2192\n0\nK \u03c0 0 ) = 0.03% for c1 (mc ) = 1.26 and c2 (mc ) = \u22120.51, which is obviously too small compared\nto the experimental value (2.12 \u00b1 0.21)% [11]. In the large-Nc limit where a2 = c2 , the\n0\nbranching ratio is increased to 1.0%. When the resonant FSI are turned on, B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 )\nis decreased to 0.36% ! Using the isospin phase shift difference (\u03b41/2 \u2212 \u03b43/2 ) = 71.4\u25e6 extracted\n0\nfrom the isospin analysis of D \u2192 K\u03c0 data, the branching ratio of D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 is enhanced\nby isospin FSI to 1.44%. It is clear that in order to understand the color non-suppression\n0\nof D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 , one needs nonfactorizable effects to account for the non-smallness of a2 and\n0\nisospin FSI to generate adequate K \u03c0 0 from K \u2212 \u03c0 + .\n0\n\nA(D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 ) = a2 X (D\n\n0 \u03c0 0 ,K 0 )\n\nB.

As noted in [1], Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 is suppressed in the presence\nof FSI through resonances, whereas Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 is enhanced (see Table I). This is ascribed\nto the fact that the external W -emission amplitudes for Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 and \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 are opposite\n\u2032\nin sign due to a relative sign difference between the form factors F0Ds \u03b7 and F0Ds \u03b7 . There\nare several new measurements of the Ds+ lifetime [13].

Unfortunately, the phase of this decay\n+ \u2032\nrelative to X (Ds \u03b7 ,\u03c1) is unknown. In the extreme case that A(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + ) is real and opposite\n8\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\nto X (Ds \u03b7,\u03c1 ) in sign, then we find B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7) = 8.3%, whereas B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 ) = 3.6%,\nrecalling that the external W -emission amplitudes for \u03c1+ \u03b7 and \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 are opposite in sign.\nBy contrast, if the amplitude of \u03c9\u03c0 + is purely imaginary, then the branching ratios of\n\u03c1+ \u03b7 and \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 will be 6.4% and 4.1%, respectively. Therefore, even if the former mode is\naccommodated, the latter is still too small compared to experiment.\nIf \u03c1+ \u03b7 and \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 are dominated by the external W -emission, then it is advantageous to\n\u2032\n\u2032\nconsider the ratios R\u03b7(\u2032 ) \u2261 \u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 ( ) )/\u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) e+ \u03bd). Generalized factorization\nleads to the form-factor-independent predictions R\u03b7 = 2.9 and R\u03b7\u2032 = 3.5, while experimentally R\u03b7 = 4.4 \u00b1 1.2 and R\u03b7\u2032 = 12.0 \u00b1 4.3 [11]. The large discrepancy between theory and\nexperiment for R\u03b7\u2032 means that there must be an additional contribution to \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 . An enhancement mechanism has been suggested in [15] that a cs\u0304 pair annihilates into a W + and\ntwo gluons, then the two gluons will hadronize mostly into \u03b7 \u2032 . If the two gluons couple to\n\u2032\n\u03b7 ( ) through the triangle quark loop, they will hadronize into the flavor-singlet \u03b70 . Since\n\u03b70 = \u03b7 \u2032 cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 sin \u03b8,\n\n(2.26)\n\nand the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03b8 is negative, it is evident that if \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 is enhanced by this\nmechanism, \u03c1+ \u03b7 will be suppressed due to the destructive interference between the external\nW -emission and the gluon-mediated process. Specifically, we find that if the branching ratio\nof \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 is increased to 9.5%, then B(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7) will be decreased to 3.9%. The other\npossibility is that the gluonic component of \u03b7 \u2032 , which can be identified with the physical\nstate, e.g. the gluonium, couples to two gluons directly. From the wave function of the\ngluonium [16]\ngluonium = \u2212\u03b7 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 + g cos \u03c6,\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhere g is a glue rich particle, we see that the gluonium contribution can enhance both \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032\nand \u03c1+ \u03b7, especially the former; that is, this new mechanism can account for the unexpectedly\nlarge branching ratio of \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 without suppressing \u03c1+ \u03b7.\nIt is clear that a production of the \u03b7 \u2032 due to gluonium-mediated processes can in principle\nenhance \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 sizeably and \u03c1+ \u03b7 slightly. Therefore, if the gluon-mediated process is responsible for the major production of \u03b7 \u2032 in Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 decay, the two gluons in the intermediate\nstate must couple to the gluonium rather than to the \u03b70 .\nSince the additional contribution to Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 is not needed to explain the other decays\ninvolving \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 (see Table I), one may wonder if the new contribution is special only to\nthe above-mentioned decay. We conjecture that this mechanism is operative if the naive W annihilation diagram is prohibited under G-parity consideration while allowed when gluons\nare emitted from the initial quark. Under this conjecture, the gluon-mediated processes are\nimportant only for the decays (D + , Ds+ ) \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 . It is likely that the branching ratio of\nD + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 is enhanced by a factor of 2, namely, B(D + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 ) = 0.16%, which is safely\nbelow the current experimental limit (see Table I).\nIII. THEORETICAL UNCERTAINTIES\n\nThe calculation of the effects of resonant FSI suffers from many theoretical uncertainties.\nIt is useful to explain them below.\n9\n\n\f1. Thus far we have assumed that coupled-channel FSI are dominated by nearby resonances in the charm mass region; other types of FSI, e.g. quark exchange, are not\nconsidered in the present work. Resonances with lower masses, e.g. the 1\u2212 resonance\nK \u2217 (890) and the 0+ resonant state K \u2217 (1430) have not been included in our calculations as they are not close to the charm mass region. However, they can contribute\nto W -exchange or W -annihilation directly via pole diagrams [17,18]. Recall that the\ndetermination of a1 and a2 from D \u2192 K\u03c0 decays is usually obtained by neglecting the\nW -exchange contribution. The inclusion of K \u2217 (1430) resonance will certainly affect\nthe extraction of a1 and a2 [17].\n2. For simplicity we have neglected W -exchange or W -annihilation contributions in our\ncalculations. However, data analysis based on the flavor-SU(3) quark-diagram scheme\nindicates that W -exchange and W -annihilation are not negligible [7,21].\n(r)\n\n3. Flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking has been introduced to the couplings cij in the\nliterature via phase-space corrections [3,4]. For example, in [4] phase-space induced\nSU(3)-symmetry breaking is included in the coupling constants:\n(r)\ncij\n\n=\n\n\u221a\nhMi Mj |Heff |ri pij\n\nqP\n\nij hMi Mj |Heff |ri\n\n2p\n\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\nij\n\nwhere pij is the momentum of the final particles in the D rest frame. In our work, we\nassume SU(3) flavor symmetry for quark-diagram amplitudes and consider its breaking\nonly at the decay rate level; it seems to us that it is not appropriate to have the phasespace correction in coupling constants.\n4. Recently it was found in [19] that phenomenologically the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle is given\nby \u03b8 = \u221215.4\u25e6 , which is somewhat smaller than the mixing angle \u221222\u25e6 employed in the\npresent paper. However, we found empirically that the latter yields a better agreement\nbetween theory and experiment than the former. For example, in the absence of\n0\nresonant FSI, or equivalently \u03b8 = \u221219.5\u25e6 , B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7) = 0.54%. The branching\nratio is increased to 0.62% when \u03b8 = \u221222\u25e6 and decreased to 0.35% at \u03b8 = \u221215.4\u25e6 ,\n0\nrecalling that experimentally B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7) = (0.70 \u00b1 0.10)% [11]. Of course, we\ncannot conclude that the magnitude of the mixing angle should be larger than 20\u25e6 in\nview of many simplified assumptions we have made.\n5. Resonance-induced FSI are mainly governed by the width and the mass of nearby\nresonances, which are unfortunately not well determined. For example, a reanalysis in\na K-matrix formalism [20] quotes mR = 1820 \u00b1 40 MeV and \u0393 = 250 \u00b1 50 MeV for the\n0\n0\n0+ resonance K \u2217 (1950). We then obtain B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7) = 0.65% and B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 ) =\n3.44%, to be compared with 0.62% and 2.57%, respectively for mR = 1945 MeV and\n0\n\u0393 = 210 MeV. Hence, the prediction of B(D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7) is significantly affected by the\nuncertainties in mR and \u0393 of the resonance.\n\n10\n\n\fIV. CONCLUSIONS\n0\n\n\u22170\n\nFor hadronic decay modes D 0 \u2192 (K , K )(\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) and (D + , Ds+ ) \u2192 (\u03c0 + , \u03c1+ )(\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032) which\nhave only one single isospin component, resonance-induced final-state interactions that mimic\nthe W -exchange or the W -annihilation topology can play an essential role. In particular,\n0\nthe decays D 0 \u2192 K \u03b7 \u2032 and D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7, which are largely suppressed in the absence of FSI,\nare enhanced dramatically by resonant FSI. It is stressed that resonant FSI are negligible\nfor \u03c1+ (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) final states because of the mismatch of the G parity of \u03c1+ (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) and the J = 0,\nI = 1 meson resonance.\n0\nWe have utilized the mode D 0 \u2192 K \u03c0 0 as an illustration to demonstrate that resonanceinduced FSI, which are crucial for some two-body decays involving one single isospin component, e.g. the final state containing an \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , play only a minor role compared to isospin\nFSI for decay modes involving several different isospin components.\nIt is difficult to understand the observed large decay rates of Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 . We argue that\na possible gluon-mediated process in which the two gluons couple directly to the gluonic\ncomponent of the \u03b7 \u2032 , e.g. the gluonium, rather than to the flavor-singlet \u03b70 , can enhance\nboth decays Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7 \u2032 and Ds+ \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b7, especially the former. Since this additional\ncontribution is not needed to explain the other decays involving the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , we conjecture\nthat this mechanism is operative if the naive W -annihilation is prohibited under G-parity\nconsideration while allowed when gluons are emitted from the initial quark.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Council of ROC under Contract\nNo. NSC89-2112-M-001-016.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] H.Y.
