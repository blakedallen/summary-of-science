Strong\ninteraction scattering in the final state [1] (Final State\nInteractions, or FSI) can modify the decay dynamics and\nmust be well understood. The two-body hadronic B decays with a charmed final state, B \u2192 D(\u2217) h, where h\nis a light meson, are of great help in studying stronginteraction physics related to the confinement of quarks\nand gluons in hadrons.\nThe decays B \u2192 D(\u2217) h can proceed through the emission of a W \u00b1 boson following three possible diagrams:\n\n\f6\nexternal, internal (see Fig. 1), or by a W \u00b1 boson exchange whose contribution to the decay rate is expected\nto be much smaller than the external and internal amplitudes [2]. The neutral B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decays proceed\nthrough the internal diagrams [3]. Since mesons are color\nsinglet objects, the quarks from the W \u00b1 decay are constrained to have the anti-color of the spectator quark,\nwhich induces a suppression of internal diagrams. For\nthis reason, internal diagrams are called color-suppressed\nand external ones are called color-allowed.\nd\nW\n\u2013\n\nB0\n\nb\n\n\u2013\n\nc\nW\n\n\u2013\n\nd\n\nu\n\nd\n\nb\n\u20130\n\n\u2013\n\nc\n\n\u2013\n\nd\n\nB\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\u03c0 ,\u03c1\n\u2013\n\n-\n\n(a)\n\nD(*)+\n(*)0\n\n(b)\n\n\u2013\n\nD\n\nd\n\n\u03c00, \u03b7, \u03c10, \u03c9, \u03b7,\n\nu\n\u2013\n\nd\n\nFIG. 1: External (a) and internal (b) tree diagrams for B 0 \u2192\nD(\u2217) h decays.\n\nWe already discussed factorization models [3\u20136] in our\nprevious publication [7]. Within that approach the nonfactorizable interactions in the final state by soft gluons are neglected. The matrix element in the effective\nweak Hamiltonian of the decay B \u2192 D(\u2217) h is then factorized into a product of asymptotic states. Factorization\nappears to be successful in the description of the colorallowed decays [8].\nThe color-suppressed b \u2192 c decays B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 were\nfirst observed by Belle [9] and CLEO [10] with 23.1 \u00d7 106\nand 9.67 \u00d7 106 BB pairs respectively. Belle has also observed the decays D0 \u03b7 and D0 \u03c9 and put upper limits on\nthe branching fraction (B) of D\u22170 \u03b7 and D\u22170 \u03c9 [9]. The\nbranching fraction of the color-suppressed decays B 0 \u2192\nD(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 , D(\u2217)0 \u03b7, D(\u2217)0 \u03c9, and D0 \u03b7 \u2032 were measured by\nBABAR [7] with 88\u00d7106 BB pairs and an upper limit was\nset on B(B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7 \u2032 ). Belle updated with 152\u00d7106 BB\npairs the measurement of B(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 ), h0 = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7,\n\u03c9 [11], and \u03b7 \u2032 [12] and studied the decays B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c10\nwith 388\u00d7106 BB pairs [13]. In an alternative approach,\nBABAR [14] used the charmless neutral B to K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0\nDalitz plot analysis with 232\u00d7106 BB pairs, and found\nB(B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 ) to be in excellent agreement with earlier\nexperimental results. BABAR has also performed a preliminary Dalitz-plot analysis of the mode B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nwith 471\u00d7106 BB pairs [15].\nMany of these branching fraction measurements are\nsignificantly larger than predictions obtained within the\nfactorization approximation [3, 16]. But, while the initial various experimental results demonstrated overall\n\ngood consistency, the most recent measurements published by Belle [11, 12] have moved on average towards\nlower B for the color-suppressed B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decays, closer to factorization predictions. However, it\nhas been demonstrated [17] that non-factorizable contributions are mostly dominant for the color-suppressed\ncharmed B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 decay and therefore cannot be neglected.\nStronger experimental constraints are therefore needed\nto distinguish between the different models of the colorsuppressed dynamics like pQCD (perturbative QCD) [18,\n19] or SCET (Soft Collinear Effective Theory) [20\u201322].\nFinally, we emphasize the need for accurate measurements of hadronic color-suppressed B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decays\nto constrain the theoretical predictions on B\u0304u,d,s decays\nto D(\u2217) P and D\u0304(\u2217) P states, where P is a light pseudoscalar meson such as a pion or a kaon [23]. Using flavor\nSU (3) symmetry, the comparison of Bd and Bs decays\noffers new possibilities to determine the decay constant\nratio fs /fd [23]. These decays are and will be employed\nto extract the CKM-angle \u03b3 and other angles [24], especially in the context of the B-physics program at the\nLHC.\nThis paper reports improved branching fraction measurements of eight color-suppressed decays B 0 \u2192\nD(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 , D(\u2217)0 \u03b7, D(\u2217)0 \u03c9, and D(\u2217)0 \u03b7 \u2032 with 454\u00d7106 BB\npairs and presents for the first time the measurement\nof the longitudinal polarization for the decay mode to\ntwo vector mesons B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9, which also constrains\nQCD models and challenges Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) (see Sec. VI).\n\nII.\n\nTHE BABAR DETECTOR AND DATA\nSAMPLE\n\nThe data used in this analysis were collected with the\nBABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212\nstorage rings operating at SLAC. The BABAR detector is\ndescribed in detail in Ref. [25]. Charged particle tracks\nare reconstructed using a five-layer silicon vertex tracker\n(SVT) and a 40-layer drift chamber (DCH) immersed in\na 1.5 T magnetic field. Tracks are identified as pions\nor kaons (particle identification or PID) based on likelihoods constructed from energy loss measurements in\nthe SVT and the DCH and from Cherenkov radiation\nangles measured in the detector of internally reflected\nCherenkov light (DIRC). Photons are reconstructed from\nshowers measured in the CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic\ncalorimeter (EMC). Muon and neutral hadron identification is performed with the instrumented flux return\n(IFR).\nThe results presented are based on a data sample of\nan integrated luminosity of 413 fb\u22121 recorded from 1999\nto 2007 at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance with a e+ e\u2212 center-ofmass (CM) energy of 10.58 GeV, corresponding to (454\u00b1\n5) \u00d7 106 BB pairs. The equal production rate of B 0 B 0\nand B + B \u2212 at that resonance is assumed in this paper,\n\n\f7\nas suggested by the Particle Data Group (PDG) [26]. A\ndata sample of 41.2 fb\u22121 with a CM energy of 10.54 GeV,\nbelow the BB threshold, is used to study background\ncontributions from continuum events e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u,\nd, s, c). We call that latter dataset off-peak events in\nwhat follows.\nSamples of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events are\nused to determine signal and background characteristics,\nto optimize selection criteria and to evaluate efficiencies. Simulated events e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 B +B \u2212 , B 0 B 0 ,\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s) and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc are generated\nwith EvtGen [27], which interfaces to Pythia [28] and\nJetset [29]. Separate samples of exclusive B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0\ndecays are generated to study the signal features and\nto quantify the signal selection efficiencies. We also\nuse high statistics control samples of exclusive decays\nB \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 \u2212 and D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 for specific selection and\nbackground studies. We study these control samples both\nin data and in the MC, using the same selection criteria.\nAll MC samples include simulation of the BABAR detector\nresponse generated through Geant4 [30]. The equivalent\nintegrated luminosity of the MC samples is about three\ntimes that of the data for BB, one time for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq\n(q = u, d, s) and twice for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc respectively. The\nequivalent integrated luminosities of the exclusive B decay mode simulations range from 50 to 2500 times the\ndataset.\n\nIII.\n\nANALYSIS METHOD\n\nA.\n\nGeneral considerations\n\nThe color-suppressed B 0 meson decay modes are reconstructed from D(\u2217)0 meson candidates that are combined with light neutral-meson candidates h0 (\u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9,\nand \u03b7 \u2032 ). The D(\u2217)0 and h0 mesons are detected in various\npossible decay channels. In total, we consider 72 different\nB 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decay modes.\nWe perform a blind analysis: the optimization of the\nvarious event selections, the background characterizations and rejections, the efficiency calculations, and most\nof the systematic uncertainty computations are based on\nstudies done with MC simulations, data sidebands, or\ndata control samples. The fits to data, including the\nvarious signal regions, are only performed after all analysis procedures are fixed and systematic uncertainties are\nstudied.\nIntermediate particles of the decays B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0\nare reconstructed by combining tracks and/or photons\nfor the decay channels with the highest decay rate and\ndetection efficiency. Vertex constraints are applied to\ncharged daughter particles before computing their invariant masses. At each step in the decay chain we require\nthat the candidate mesons have masses consistent with\ntheir assumed particle type. If daughter particles are\nproduced in the decay of a parent meson with a natural width that is small relative to the reconstructed\n\nwidth, we constrain the mass of this meson to its nominal\nvalue, except for the \u03c9 and the \u03c10 [26]. The B 0 mass is\ncomputed using the constraint of the beam energy (see\nSec. III C 1). This fitting technique improves the resolution of the energy and the momentum of the B 0 candidates as they are calculated from improved energies and\nmomenta of the D(\u2217)0 and h0 .\nCharged particle tracks are reconstructed from measurements in the SVT and/or the DCH, and they are\nassigned various particle identification probabilities by\nthe PID algorithms. Extrapolated tracks must be in the\nvicinity of the e+ e\u2212 interaction point, i.e. within 1.5 cm\nin the plane transverse to the beam axis and 2.5 cm along\nthe beam axis. The charged tracks used for the reconstruction of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7(\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) must\nin addition have a transverse momentum pT larger than\n100 MeV/c and at least 12 hits in the DCH. When a\nPID positive identification is required for a track, the\ntrack polar angle \u03b8 must be in the DIRC fiducial region\n25.78\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 146.10\u25e6. Photons are defined as single\nclusters of energy deposition in the EMC crystals not\nmatched to a track, and with shower lateral shape consistent with photons. Because of the high machine background in the very forward part of the EMC, we reject\nphotons detected in the region \u03b8 < 21.19\u25e6 . We assume\nthat the production point of the photons is the reconstructed primary vertex of each e+ e\u2212 collision.\nThe selections applied to each meson (\u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9, \u03b7 \u2032 , D0 ,\nand\u221aD\u22170 ) are optimized by maximizing the figure of merit\nS/ S + B, where S is the number of signal and B is the\nnumber of background events. The numbers S and B\nare computed from simulations, and the branching ratios\nused to evaluate S are the present world average values\nof color-suppressed decay modes [26]. Each particle mass\ndistribution is fitted with a set of Gaussian functions or\na so-called modified Novosibirsk empirical function [31],\nwhich is composed of a Gaussian-like peaking part with\ntwo tails at low and high values. Particle candidates are\nthen required to have a mass within \u00b12.5 \u03c3 around the\nfitted mass central value, where \u03c3 is the resolution of\nthe mass distribution obtained by the fit. For the decays\nD0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03b3, the lower bound is\nextended to 3 \u03c3 because of the photon energy losses in\nfront of and between the EMC crystals, which makes the\nmass distribution asymmetric with a tail at low values.\n\nB.\n\nSelection of intermediate particles\n1.\n\n\u03c0 0 selection\n\nThe \u03c0 0 mesons are reconstructed from photon pairs.\nEach photon energy E\u03b3 must be greater than 85 MeV\nfor \u03c0 0 produced directly from B 0 decays, and greater\nthan 60 MeV for \u03c0 0 from \u03b7, \u03c9, or D0 meson decays.\nSlow neutral pions originating from D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 decays\nmust satisfy E\u03b3 > 30 MeV. The \u03c0 0 reconstructed mass\nresolution ranges 6.5 \u2212 7.0 MeV/c2 for \u03c0 0 from \u03b7, \u03c9, and\n\n\f8\nD0 mesons decays, and 7.0 \u2212 7.5 MeV/c2 for \u03c0 0 produced\nin D\u22170 or B 0 decays.\n2.\n\n\u03b7 selection\n\nThe \u03b7 mesons are reconstructed in the \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0\ndecay modes, accounting for about 62% of the total decay\nrate [26], and may originate from B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 decays.\nThe \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidates are reconstructed by combining two photons that satisfy E\u03b3 > 200 MeV for B 0\ndaughters and E\u03b3 > 180 MeV for \u03b7 \u2032 daughters. As photons originating from high momentum \u03c0 0 mesons may\nfake a \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 signal, a veto is applied. The \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\ncandidate is rejected if either photon combined with any\nother photon in the event with E\u03b3 > 200 MeV has an invariant mass between 115 and 150 MeV/c2 . Such a veto\nretains 93% of the signal while reducing the background\nof fake \u03b7 mesons candidates by a factor of two. The resolution of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mass distribution is approximately\n15 MeV/c2 , dominated by the resolution on the photon\nenergy measurement in the EMC.\nFor \u03b7 candidates reconstructed in the decay channel\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the \u03c0 0 is required to satisfy the conditions described in Sec. III B 1. The mass resolution is about\n3 MeV/c2 , which is better than for the mode \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3,\nthanks to the relatively better resolution of the tracking system and the various vertex and mass constraints\napplied to the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 candidates.\n3.\n\n\u03c9 selection\n\nThe \u03c9 mesons are reconstructed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay mode. This mode accounts for approximately 89%\nof the total decay rate. The \u03c0 0 is required to satisfy\nthe conditions described in Sec. III B 1 and the transverse momenta of the charged pions must be greater than\n200 MeV/c. The natural width of the \u03c9 mass distribution \u0393 = 8.49 MeV [26] is comparable to the experimental resolution \u03c3 \u223c 7 MeV/c2 , therefore the \u03c9 mass is not\nconstrained\np to its nominal value. We define a total width\n\u03c3tot = \u03c3 2 + \u03932 /c4 \u2243 11 MeV/c2 and require the \u03c9 candidates to satisfy |m\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bcm\u03c9 | < 2.5 \u03c3tot (where \u03bcm\u03c9 is\nthe mean of the \u03c9 mass distribution).\n\nthe angular distribution is proportional to sin2 \u03b8\u03c10 for signal, and is flat for background. The \u03c10 candidates with\n| cos \u03b8\u03c10 | > 0.73 are rejected. Due to the large \u03c10 natural\nwidth \u0393 = 149.1 MeV [26], the mass of the \u03c10 candidate\nmust lie within 160 MeV/c2 around the nominal mass\nvalue and no mass constraint is applied.\n\n5.\n\nThe \u03b7 \u2032 mesons are reconstructed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7(\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\nand \u03c10 \u03b3 decay modes. These modes account for approximately 46.3% of the total decay rate.\nOnly the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 sub-mode is used in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 reconstruction due to its higher efficiency. The selection\nis described in Sec. III B 2. For candidates reconstructed\nin the \u03c10 \u03b3 decay channel we select \u03c10 candidates as described in Sec. III B 4, and the photons must have an energy larger than 200 MeV. As photons coming from \u03c0 0\ndecays may fake signal, a veto as described in Sec. III B 2\nis applied. The \u03b7 \u2032 mass resolution is about 3 MeV/c2 for\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 and 8 MeV/c2 for \u03c10 \u03b3.\n\n6.\n\n\u03c10 selection\n\nThe \u03c10 mesons originate from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03b3 and are reconstructed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode. The charged tracks\nmust satisfy pT (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) > 100 MeV/c, where pT is the transverse component of the momentum with respect to the\nbeam axis. We define the helicity angle \u03b8\u03c10 as the angle between the direction of the momentum of one of the\ntwo pions and that of the \u03b7 \u2032 both evaluated in the \u03c10\ncenter-of-mass frame. Because the \u03c10 is a vector meson,\n\nKS0 selection\n\nThe KS0 mesons are reconstructed through their decay\nto two charged pions (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ) which must originate from\na common vertex, with a \u03c72 probability of the vertex\nfit that must be larger than 0.1%. We define the flight\nsignificance as the ratio L/\u03c3L , where L is the KS0 flight\nlength in the plane transverse to the beam axis and \u03c3L\nis the resolution on L determined from the vertex fit.\nThe combinatorial background is rejected by requiring a\nflight significance larger than 5. The reconstructed KS0\nmass resolution is about 2 MeV/c2 for a core Gaussian\npart corresponding to about 70% of the candidates and\n5 MeV/c2 for the remaining part, depending on the transverse position of the KS0 decay within the tracking system\n(SVT or DCH).\n\n7.\n\nD0 selection\n\nThe D0 mesons are reconstructed in the K \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\nK \u03c0 \u03c0 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and KS0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay modes.\nThese modes account for about 29% of the total decay rate. All D0 candidates must satisfy p\u2217 (D0 ) >\n1.1 GeV/c, where p\u2217 refers to the value of the momentum\ncomputed in the \u03a5 (4S) rest frame. That requirement is\nloose enough so that various sources of background can\npopulate the sidebands of the signal region.\nFor the decay modes reconstructed only with tracks,\nwe require that the charged pions originating from the\nD0 candidates fulfill pT (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) > 400 MeV/c for K \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\npT (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) > 100 MeV/c for K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and pT (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) >\n120 MeV/c for KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + .\n\u2212 + 0\n\n4.\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 selection\n\n\f9\nThe charged tracks must originate from a common vertex, therefore the \u03c72 probability of the vertex fit must be\nlarger than 0.1% for the decay channel K \u2212 \u03c0 + and larger\nthan 0.5% for the other modes with more abundant background. Because of the increasing level of background\npresent for the various decay modes, the kaon candidates\nmust satisfy from looser to tighter PID criteria for the\nmodes K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 respectively.\nFor KS0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the KS0 candidates must satisfy the selection criteria described in Sec. III B 6.\nFor the decay D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 the combinatorial\nbackground can significantly be reduced by using the\nparametrization of the K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 Dalitz-plot distribution\nas provided by the Fermilab E691 experiment [32]. This\ndistribution is dominated by the two K \u2217 resonances\n(K \u22170 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and K \u2217\u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) and by the \u03c1+ (\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 )\nresonance. Therefore we select only D0 candidates that\nfall in the enhanced region of the Dalitz plot as determined by the above parametrization. The \u03c0 0 must satisfy\nthe selections described in Sec. III B 1.\nThe reconstructed D0 mass resolution is about 5, 5.5,\n6.5, and 11 MeV/c2 for the decay modes K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\nKS0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 respectively.\n8.\n\nD\u22170 selection\n\nThe D\u22170 mesons are reconstructed in the D0 \u03c0 0 and\nD \u03b3 decay modes. The \u03c0 0 and D0 candidates are requested to satisfy the selections described in Sec. III B 1\nand III B 7 respectively. The photons from D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03b3\nmust fulfill the additional condition E\u03b3 > 130 MeV and\nmust pass the \u03c0 0 veto as described in Sec. III B 2.\nThe resolution of the mass difference \u2206m \u2261 mD\u22170 \u2212\nmD0 is about 1.3 MeV/c2 for D0 \u03c0 0 and 7 MeV/c2 for\nD0 \u03b3.\n0\n\nC.\n\nSelection of B-meson candidates\n\nThe B candidates are reconstructed by combining a\nD(\u2217)0 with an h0 , with the D(\u2217)0 and h0 masses constrained to their nominal values (except when h0 is an\n\u03c9). One needs to discriminate between true B signal\ncandidates and fake B candidates. The fake B candidates originate from combinatorial backgrounds, from\nother specific B modes, or from the cross feed events\nbetween reconstructed color-suppressed signals.\n1.\n\nB-mesons kinematic variables\n\nTwo kinematic variables are commonly used in BABAR\nto select B candidates: the energy-substituted mass mES\nand the energy difference \u2206E. These two variables use\nconstraints from the precise knowledge of the beam energies and from energy conservation in the two-body decay\n\u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB. The quantity mES is the invariant mass of\n\nthe B candidate where the B energy is set to the beam\nenergy in the CM frame:\ns\u0012\n\u00132\ns/2 + p~0 .~\npB\nmES =\n\u2212 |~\np B |2 .\n(1)\nE0\nThe variable \u2206E is the energy difference between the\nreconstructed B energy and the beam energy in the CM\nframe:\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2206E = ED\n(\u2217) + Eh \u2212\n\n\u221a\ns/2,\n\n(2)\n\u221a\nwhere s is the e+ e\u2212 center-of-mass energy. The small\nvariations of the beam energy over the duration of the run\nare corrected when calculating mES . For the momentum\n~pi (i = 0, B) and the energy E0 , the subscripts 0 and B\nrefer to the e+ e\u2212 system and the reconstructed B meson,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nrespectively. The energies ED\n(\u2217) and Eh are calculated\n(\u2217)0\n0\nfrom the measured D\nand h momenta.\nFor the various decay channels of the B signal events,\nthe mES distribution peaks at the B mass with a resolution of 2.6 \u2212 3 MeV/c2 , dominated by the beam energy\nspread, whereas \u2206E peaks near zero with a resolution of\n15 \u2212 50 MeV depending on the number of photons in the\nfinal state.\n2.\n\nRejection of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq background\n\nThe continuum background e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq, where q is a\nlight quark u,\u2032 d, s, or c, creates high momentum mesons\nD(\u2217)0 , \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 ( ) , \u03c9 that can fake the signal mesons originating from the two body decays B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 . That\nbackground is dominated by cc\u0304 processes and to a lesser\nextent by ss\u0304 processes. Since the B mesons are produced\nalmost at rest in the \u03a5 (4S) frame, the \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB\nevent shape is isotropically distributed. By comparison,\nthe qq events have a back-to-back jet-like shape. The\nqq background is therefore discriminated by employing\nevent shape variables. The following set of variables was\nfound to be optimal among various tested configurations:\n\u2022 The thrust angle \u03b8T defined as the angle between\nthe thrust axis of the B candidate and the thrust\naxis of the rest of event, the thrust axis being the\naxis on which the sum of projected momentum is\nmaximal. The distribution of | cos \u03b8T | is flat for\nsignal and peaks at 1 for continuum background.\n\u2022 Event shape monomials L0 and L2 defined as\nX\nX\n\u2192\n\u2192\n|\u2212\np \u2217i | cos2 \u03b8i\u2217 ,\n(3)\n|\u2212\np \u2217i |; L2 =\nL0 =\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2192\nwith \u2212\np \u2217i being the CM momentum of the particle\ni that does not come from the B candidate, and \u03b8i\u2217\n\u2192\nis the angle between \u2212\np \u2217i and the thrust axis of the\nB candidate.\n\n\f10\n\u2217\n\u2022 The polar angle \u03b8B\nbetween the B momentum in\nthe \u03a5 (4S) frame and the beam axis. With the\n\u03a5 (4S) being vector and the B mesons being pseudoscalar, the angular distribution is proportional to\n\u2217\nsin2 \u03b8B\nfor signal and roughly flat for background.\n\nThese four variables are combined into a Fisher discriminant built with the TMVA [33] toolkit package. An\nalternate approach employing a multi-layer perceptron\nartificial neural network with two hidden layers within\nthe same framework was tested and showed marginal relative gain, therefore the Fisher discriminant is used.\nThe Fisher discriminant Fshape is trained with signal\nMC events and off-peak data events. In order to maximize the number of off-peak events all the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0\nmodes are combined. We retain signal MC events with\nmES in the signal region 5.27 \u2212 5.29 MeV/c2 and off-peak\ndata events with mES in the range 5.25 \u2212 5.27 MeV/c2 ,\naccounting for half of the 40 MeV CM energy-shift below the \u03a5 (4S) resonance. The training and testing\nof the multivariate classifier are performed with nonoverlapping data samples of equal size obtained from a\ncocktail of 20, 000 MC simulation signal events and from\n20, 000 off-peak events. The obtained Fisher formula is\nFshape = 2.36 \u2212 1.18 \u00d7 | cos \u03b8T | +\n\u2217\n0.20 \u00d7 L0 \u2212 1.01 \u00d7 L2 \u2212 0.80 \u00d7 | cos \u03b8B\n|.\n\n(4)\n\nThe qq background is reduced by applying a selection cut\non Fshape . The selection is optimized for each of the 72\nsignal decay channels by maximizing the statistical significance with signal MC against generic MC e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq,\nq 6= b. This requirement for the various decay modes retains between about 30% and 97% of B signal events,\nwhile rejecting between about 98% and 35% of the background from light qq.\n\n3.\n\nWe require B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c9 candidates to satisfy Fhel > \u22120.1,\nto obtain an efficiency (rejection) on signal (background)\nof about 85% (62%).\nWe also exploit the angular distribution properties in\nthe decay D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 to reject combinatorial background. We define the helicity angle \u03b8D\u2217 as the angle\nbetween the line-of-flight of the D0 and that of the B 0 ,\nboth evaluated in the D\u22170 rest frame. The angular distribution is proportional to cos2 \u03b8D\u2217 for signal and roughly\nflat for combinatorial background. Although in principle such a behavior could be employed for B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0 ,\nD\u22170 \u03b7, and D\u22170 \u03b7 \u2032 , a selection on | cos \u03b8D\u2217 | significantly\nimproves the statistical significance for the B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0\nmode only. Therefore D\u22170 candidates coming from the\ndecay B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0 are required to satisfy | cos \u03b8D\u2217 | > 0.4\nwith an efficiency (rejection) on signal (background) of\nabout 91% (33%).\nA major BB background contribution in the analysis of the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 decay channel comes from the\ncolor-allowed decay B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 . If the charged pion\n(mostly slow) from the decay \u03c1\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is omitted in\nthe reconstruction of the B 0 candidate, B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212\nevents can mimic the D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 signal. Moreover, the decay modes B(B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 ) are 30 \u2212 50 times larger\nthan those of the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 modes, and are poorly\nknown: \u2206B/B = 13.4%\u221217.3% [26]. A veto is applied to\nreduce this background. For each B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 candidate, we combine any remaining negatively charged track\nin the event to reconstruct a B \u2212 candidate in the decay\nmode D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 . If the reconstructed B \u2212 candidate satisfies mES (B \u2212 ) > 5.27 GeV/c2 , |\u2206E(B \u2212 )| < 100 MeV,\n0\n2\nand |m\u03c1\u2212 \u2212 mPDG\n\u03c1\u2212 | < 250 MeV/c , then the initial B\ncandidate is rejected. For the analysis of the decay mode\nB 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 (B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0 ), the veto retains about\n90% (82%) of signal and rejects about 67% (56%) of\nB \u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c1\u2212 and 44% (66%) of B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c1\u2212 background.\n\nRejection of other specific backgrounds\n\nThe \u03c9 mesons in B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c9 decays are longitudinally\npolarized. We define the angle \u03b8\u03c9 [7, 34] as the the angle\nbetween the normal to the plane of the three daughter\npions in the \u03c9 frame and the line-of-flight of the B 0 meson\nin the \u03c9 rest frame. This definition is the equivalent\nof the two-body helicity angle for the three-body decay.\nTo describe the three-body decay distribution of \u03c9 \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , we define the Dalitz angle \u03b8D [7] as the angle\nbetween the \u03c0 0 momentum in the \u03c9 frame and the \u03c0 +\nmomentum in the frame of the pair of charged pions.\nThe signal distribution is proportional to cos2 \u03b8\u03c9 and\nsin2 \u03b8D , while the combinatorial background distribution\nis roughly flat as a function of cos \u03b8\u03c9 and cos \u03b8D . These\ntwo angles are combined into a Fisher discriminant Fhel\nbuilt from signal MC events and generic qq and BB MC\nevents:\nFhel = \u22121.41 \u2212 1.01 \u00d7 | cos \u03b8D | + 3.03 \u00d7 | cos \u03b8\u03c9 |.\n\n(5)\n\n4.\n\nChoice of the \"best\" B candidate in the event\n\nThe average number of B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 candidates per\nevent after all selections ranges between 1 and 1.6 depending on the complexity of the sub-decays. We perform all the 72 B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decay mode analyzes in\nparallel. Such that each possible decay channel is selected with a dedicated analysis, for a given decay mode\none B candidate only is kept per event. The chosen B is\nthat with the smallest value of\n\n\u03c72B =\n\n\u0012\n\nm D 0 \u2212 \u03bcm D 0\n\u03c3mD0\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\nmh0 \u2212 \u03bcmh0\n\u03c3mh0\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n\f11\nfor D0 h0 modes, and\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm D 0 \u2212 \u03bcm D 0 2\nmh0 \u2212 \u03bcmh0 2\n+\n\u03c3mD0\n\u03c3mh0\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u2206m \u2212 \u03bc\u2206m\n,\n+\n\u03c3\u2206m\n\n\u03c72B =\n\n\u0012\n\n(7)\n\nfor the D\u22170 h0 modes. The quantities \u03c3mD0 and \u03c3mh0\n(\u03bcmD0 and \u03bcmh0 ) are the resolution (mean) of the mass\ndistributions. The quantities \u03bc\u2206m and \u03c3\u2206m are respectively the mean and resolution of the \u2206m distributions.\nThese quantities are obtained from fits of the mass distribution of simulated candidates selected from signal MC\nsimulations.\nThe probability of choosing the true B 0 candidate in\nthe event according to the above criteria ranges from 71\nto 100%. The cases with lower probabilities correspond\nto the D(\u2217)0 h0 modes with high neutral multiplicity.\n5.\n\nSelection efficiencies\n\nThe branching fractions of the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 decays\nis computed as\nB(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 ) =\n\nNS\n,\nNB B\u0304 * E * Bsec\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Bsec is the product of the branching fractions associated with the secondary decays of the D(\u2217)0 and h0\nmesons for the each of the 72 decay channels considered\nin this paper [26]. NB B\u0304 is the number of BB pairs in\ndata and NS is the number of signal events remaining\nafter all the selections. The quantity E is the total signal\nefficiency including reconstruction (detector and trigger\nacceptance) and analysis selections. It is computed from\neach of the 72 exclusive high statistics MC simulation\nsamples.\nThe selection efficiency from MC simulation is slightly\ndifferent from the efficiency in data. The MC efficiency\nand its systematic uncertainty therefore has to be adjusted according to control samples. For the reconstruction of \u03c0 0 /\u03b3, the efficiency corrections are obtained from\ndetailed studies performed with a high statistics and\nhigh purity control sample of \u03c0 0 mesons produced in\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c1(\u03c0\u03c0 0 )\u03bd\u03c4 decays normalized to \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03c4 , to unfold\ntracking effects. Such corrections are validated against\nstudies performed on the relative ratio of the number of\ndetected D0 mesons in the decays D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and\nD0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and produced in the decay of D\u2217+ mesons\nfrom e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304 events. The relative data/simulation\nefficiency measurements for charged tracks are similarly based on studies of track mis-reconstruction using e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events. On one side the events are\ntagged from a lepton in the decay \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l \u03bd\u03c4 and on\nthe other side one reconstructs two or three tracks from\nthe decay \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h+ \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . The simulated efficiency\n\nof charged particle identification is compared to the efficiency computed in data with control samples of kaons\nfrom D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + produced in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304\nevents. The efficiency for KS0 candidates is modified using\na data sample of KS0 , mainly arising from the continuum\nprocesses e+ e\u2212 into qq.\nThe efficiency corrections for the selection criteria applied to D(\u2217)0 candidates and on the Fisher discriminant\n(Fhel ) for the continuum qq (q 6= b) rejection are obtained\nfrom studies of a B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 \u2212 control sample. This\nabundant control sample is chosen for its kinematic similarity with B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 . The corrections are computed\nfrom the ratios Erel. (data)/Erel.(MC), where the relative\nefficiencies Erel. are computed with the signal yields as obtained from fits to mES distributions of B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 \u2212\ncandidates in data and MC simulation, before and after applying the various selections. The obtained results are checked with the color-allowed control sample\nB \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 , which has slightly different kinematics\ndue to the relatively higher mass of the \u03c1\u2212 , and therefore\nvalidates those corrections for the modes such as D(\u2217)0 \u03b7 \u2032 .\nThe reconstruction efficiency of B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 depends\non the angular distribution, which is not yet known\n(fL \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1). To evaluate this efficiency we combine\na set of properly weighted fully longitudinally and fully\ntransversely polarized MC samples, according to the fraction of longitudinal polarization that we measure in this\npaper (see Sec. VI).\nD.\n\nFit procedure and data distributions\n\nWe present the fits used to extract the branching fractions B. For each of the 72 possible B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 subdecay modes, using an iterative procedure (discussed in\nSec. III D 5), we fit the \u2206E distribution in the range\n|\u2206E| < 280 MeV for mES > 5.27 GeV/c2 to get the\nsignal (NS ) and background yields. The fit of the \u2206E\ndistribution allows us to model and adjust the complex\nnon-combinatoric B background structure without relying completely on simulation.\nThe data samples corresponding to each B 0 decay\nmode are disjoint and the fits are performed independently for each mode. According to their physical origin, four categories of events with differently shaped \u2206E\ndistributions are considered: signal events, cross-feed\nevents, peaking background events, and combinatorial\nbackground events.

Some of the PDF component parameters are fixed from the MC simulation (see details\nin the following sections).\nThe individual corresponding branching ratios are\ncomputed and then combined as explained in Sec. V.\n1.\n\nSignal contribution\n\nAll of the 72 possible reconstructed B 0 decay channels\ncontain at least one photon. Due to the possible energy\nlosses of early showering photons in the detector material before the EMC, the \u2206E shape for signal is modeled\nby the modified Novosibirsk PDF [31]. A Gaussian PDF\nis added to the modes with a large \u2206E resolution to\ndescribe mis-reconstructed events. The signal shape parameters are estimated from a ML fit to the distributions\n\nof simulated signal events in the high statistics exclusive\ndecay modes.\n2.\n\nCross-feed contribution\n\nWe call \"cross feed\" the events from all of the reconstructed D(\u2217)0 h0 modes, except the one under consideration, that pass the complete selection. The cross-feed\nevents are a non-negligible part of the \u2206E peak in some\nof the modes, and the signal event yield must be corrected\nfor these cross-feed events. As the various decay channels\nare studied in parallel, we use an iterative procedure to\naccount for those contributions in the synchronous measurements (see Sec. III D 5).\nThe dominant cross-feed contribution to B 0 \u2192 D0 h0\ncomes from the companion decay channel B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 h0 ,\nwhen the \u03c0 0 /\u03b3 from the D\u22170 decay is not reconstructed.\nSuch cross-feed events are shifted in \u2206E by approximately the mass of the \u03c0 0 (\u2212135 MeV), with a long\ntail from D\u22170 (\u2192 D0 \u03b3)h0 leaking into the signal region.\nSimilarly, the decay channel B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 h0 receives a\ncross-feed contribution from the associated decay mode\nB 0 \u2192 D0 h0 and there is a cross-contamination between\nthe D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 and D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03b3 decay channels.\nThe remaining cross-feed contributions, i.e. from other\nB 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 color-suppressed decay modes, were stud-\n\n\f400\n\n(b)\n\n350\n300\n250\n200\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n(d)\n\n40\n30\n\n10\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n(e)\n\n16\n\n12\n10\n8\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n(f)\n\n100\n\n14\n\n80\n60\n40\n\n4\n10\n\n40\n\n20\n\n6\n\n20\n\n50\n\n50\n0.2\n\n50\n\n60\n\n30\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n60\n\n70\n\n100\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n80\n\n150\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n(a)\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n220\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n13\n\n20\n\n2\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\nFIG. 3: Fits of \u2206E distributions in data for modes B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0 (a), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 (b), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3) (c), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7(\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 0 )\n(d), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c0\u03c0\u03b7) (e), and B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c10 \u03b3) (f), where the D\u22170 mesons decay into the signal mode D0 \u03c0 0 . A detailed\nlegend is provided in the caption of Fig. 2.\n\nied with the generic MC simulation. They were found to\nbe highly negligible and represent at most 1 % of the signal, in the region |\u2206E| < 100 MeV. Therefore they are\naccounted for by the generic MC simulation, whose generated branching fractions were taken from the PDG [26].\n\n3.\n\nPeaking BB background contributions\n\nThe major background in the reconstruction of B 0 \u2192\nD\n\u03c0 comes from the decays B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212\n(see Sec. III C 3). Their contribution is modeled by\nhistogram-based PDFs built from the high statistics exclusive signal MC simulation samples. The individual distributions of the two backgrounds B \u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c1\u2212\nand B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c1\u2212 that pass the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 selections, including the specific veto requirement as described\nin Sec. III C 3, cannot be distinguished. As a consequence, given the large uncertainty on their branching\nfractions, the overall normalization of B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212\nPDF is left floating but the relative ratio N (B \u2212 \u2192\nD\u22170 \u03c1\u2212 )/N (B \u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c1\u2212 ) of the PDF normalization\nis fixed. The value of this ratio is extracted directly\nfrom the data by reconstructing exclusively each of the\nB \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 modes rejected by the veto requirements. Those fully reconstructed B \u2212 mesons differ from\nthe B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 , that pass all the B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0\nselections, by the additional selected slow charged \u03c0\n(\u2217)0 0\n\noriginated from the \u03c1\u2212 meson. The relative correction\non that ratio for events surviving the veto selection is\nthen computed using the MC simulation for generated\nB \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 decays. A systematic uncertainty on that\nassumption is assigned (see Sec. IV).\nIn the cases of B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c9/\u03b7(\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) modes,\nadditional contributions come from the B decay modes\nD(\u2217) n\u03c0\u03c0 (0) , where n = 1, 2, or 3, and through interme\u2212\ndiate resonances such as \u03c9 and \u03c1\u2212\n3 (1690)(\u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 ). These\npeaking backgrounds are modeled by a first-order polynomial PDF plus a Gaussian PDF determined from the\ngeneric BB MC simulation. The relative normalization\nof that Gaussian PDF component is left floating in the\nfit, since some of the branching fractions of the B decay\nmodes D(\u2217) n\u03c0\u03c0 (0) are not precisely known [26].\n\n4.\n\nCombinatorial background contribution\n\nThe shape parameters of the combinatorial background PDFs are obtained from ML fits to the generic\nBB and continuum MC, where all signal, cross feed\nand peaking BB background events have been removed.\nThe combinatorial background from BB and qq (q 6= b)\nare summed and modeled by a second-order polynomial\nPDF.\n\n\f350\n\n(b)\n\n300\n\n200\n\n250\n\n150\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n\n20\n10\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n6\n5\n\n3\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n0\n\n(f)\n\n100\n\n7\n\n10\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\n120\n\n(e)\n\n8\n\n4\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n15\n\n0\n\n40\n\n50\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n(d)\n\n50\n\n30\n\n0.2\n\n(c)\n\n60\n\n100\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n40\n\n70\n\n150\n\n50\n0\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n(a)\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n250\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\nEvents / 14 MeV\n\n14\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206 E (GeV)\n\nFIG. 4: Fits of \u2206E distributions in data for modes B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 0 (a), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 (b), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3) (c), B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7(\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 0 )\n(d), and B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c0\u03c0\u03b7) (e), where the D\u22170 mesons decay into the signal mode D0 \u03b3.

A detailed legend is provided in the caption of Fig. 2.\n\n5.\n\nIterative fitting procedure\n\nWe fit the \u2206E distribution using the PDFs for the signal, for the cross feed, for the peaking background, and\nfor the combinatorial background as detailed in the previous sections. The normalization of the signal, the peaking BB backgrounds, and the combinatorial background\ncomponents are allowed to float in the fit. The mean of\nthe signal PDF is left floating for the sum of D(\u2217)0 subdecays. For each D0 sub-mode, the signal mean PDF\nis fixed to the value obtained from the fit to the sum of\nD0 sub-modes. Those free parameters are extracted by\nmaximizing the unbinned extended likelihood to the \u2206E\ndistribution defined in Eqs. (9) and (10). Other PDF\nparameters are fixed from fit results obtained with MC\nsimulations, when studying separately each of the signal\nand background categories.\nIn the global event yield extraction of all the various\nB 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 color-suppressed signals studied in this\npaper, a given mode can be signal and cross feed to other\nmodes at the same time. In order to use the B computed\nin this analysis, the yield extraction is performed through\nan iterative fit on D\u22170 h0 and D0 h0 . The normalization\nof cross-feed contribution from D(\u2217)0 h0 is then fixed to\nthe B measured in the previous fit iteration. For the\ncross-feed contributions, the PDG branching fraction [26]\nvalues are used as starting points. This iterative method\nconverges quickly to stable B values, with a variation of\n\nless than 10% of the statistical uncertainty, in less than\n5 iterations.\nWe check the absence of biases in our fit procedure\nby studying pseudo-experiments with a large number of\ndifferent data-sized samples for the various signals. The\nextraction procedure is applied to these samples where\nbackground events are generated and added from the fitted PDFs. The signal samples are assembled from nonoverlapping samples corresponding to the exclusive high\nstatistics MC signals, with yields corresponding to the\nMC-generated value of the branching fraction. No significant biases are found.\n\n6.\n\nData distributions and event yields from summed\nsub-decay modes\n\nThe fitting procedure is applied to data at the very\nlast stage of the blind analysis. Though the event yields\nand B measurements are performed separately for each\nof the 72 considered sub-decay modes, we illustrate here,\nin a compact manner, the magnitude of the signal and\nbackground component yields, and the statistical significances, of the various decay channels B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 ,\nsumming together all the D0 sub-modes.

(data)/Erel. (MC), including the correlations between the samples before and after selections\n(see Sec. III C 5). The effects of the cuts on \u03c10 and D0 \u03c9\nhelicities are obtained by varying the selection cut values\nby \u00b110% around the maximum of statistical significance.\nAll uncertainties on intermediate particle selections are\ncombined into the category \"Particles selection\".\nThe uncertainty quoted for \"\u2206E Fit\" gathers the\nchanges due the limited knowledge on the shapes of signal\nand background PDFs, and on the cross-feed branching\nfraction. For example, the modes D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 /\u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3) have\n\n\f17\nhigh or low momentum \u03b3 in the final state. The difference\nbetween data and MC simulation in energy scale and resolution for neutrals is estimated from a study of the high\nstatistics control sample B \u2212 \u2192 D0 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c1\u2212 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u2212 ),\nwhich yields the difference between data and MC simulation, \u2243 5.7 MeV, for the mean and \u2243 3.3 MeV, for\nthe resolution. This study was cross-checked against another one performed with the high statistics and very\npure control sample B \u2212 \u2192 D0 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 )\u03c0 \u2212 . With that\ncontrol sample we find a difference between data and\nMC simulation of respectively \u2243 1.7 MeV, for the mean\nand \u2243 0.04 MeV, for the resolution. For the modes\nB 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 /\u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3), the uncertainty due to the signal\nshape is obtained by varying conservatively the signal\nPDF mean by \u00b15.7 MeV and the width by \u00b13.3 MeV.\nFor the other B 0 signal modes, each PDF parameter is\nvaried within \u00b11 \u03c3 of its MC simulation precision, and\nthe relative difference on the fitted event yield is taken as\na systematic incertitude. The various parameters are varied one at a time, independently. The relative differences\nwhile varying the \u2206E PDF parameters are then summed\nup in quadrature. This sum is taken as the systematic\ndoubt on the \u2206E shapes.\nThe uncertainty on the combinatorial background\nshape (including both BB and qq (q 6= b) events) is evaluated from the comparison of generic MC simulation and\ndata in the mES sidebands: 5.24 < mES < 5.26 GeV/c2 .\nThe observed difference between data and simulation has\nthen been used as a systematics. When a Gaussian is\nadded to the combinatorial background shape, to model\nadditional peaking BB background contributions (see\nSec. III D 3), the related effect is computed by varying\nits means and resolution by \u00b11 \u03c3.\nWe account for possible differences in the PDF shape\nof the B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 background that is modeled by a\nnon-parametric PDF. As above, it is obtained by shifting\nand smearing the PDF mean and resolution by \u00b15.7 MeV\nand \u00b13.3 MeV respectively. The non-parametric PDF is\nconvoluted with a Gaussian with the previously defined\nmean and width values. The quadratic sum of the various changes on the signal event yield is taken as the\nsystematic uncertainty.\nThe relative ratio of the B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c1\u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192\nD0 \u03c1\u2212 backgrounds for the studies of the modes B 0 \u2192\nD(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 has been fixed to the selected B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212\nevents of the data control sample, for rejected B \u2212 events\nwith the veto described in Sec. III C 3. The effect of such\na veto on that ratio is then computed from MC simulation. We assign as a conservative systematic uncertainty\nhalf of the difference between the nominal result and\nthe result from the MC simulation assuming the PDG\nbranching ratios of B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 [26].\nThe acceptance of B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 is computed from the\nsum of purely longitudinally (fL = 0) and transversely\n(fL = 1) polarized MC simulation signals, weighted by\nour measurement of fL (see Sec. VI). The systematic limited knowledge of the efficiency due to the unknown fraction of D\u22170 \u03c9 longitudinal polarization is then estimated\n\nby varying fL by \u00b11 \u03c3 in the estimation of the signal\nacceptance. This contribution is slightly larger than 1%,\nwhile it is expected to be about 10.5% if the fraction fL\nwere unknown. This is one of the motivations for measuring the polarization of the decay channel B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9\n(see Sec. VI).\nThe most significant sources of systematic uncertainties come from the \u03c0 0 /\u03b3 reconstruction, the \u2206E fits,\nand the uncertainties on the world average branching\nfractions of the secondary decay channels. In the case\nof the modes B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 , the contributions from\nB \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 backgrounds are also not negligible.\nTABLE IV: Branching fractions of decay channels B 0 \u2192\nD(\u2217)0 h0 , where the branching fraction measured in each D0\nmodes are combined.

The previous experimental results from BABAR [7, 14], Belle [11, 12],\nand CLEO [10] are also shown (black points). The horizontal bars represent the statistical contribution alone and the quadratic\nsum of the statistical and systematic uncertainty contributions. The width of the vertical yellow band corresponds to \u00b11 \u03c3 of\nthe combined measurement, where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are summed in quadrature.\n\n\f20\nThese branching fractions are combined using the socalled Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) technique [35], that accounts for the correlation between the\nvarious modes. In the BLUE method the average value\nis a linear combination of the individual measurements,\nB=\n\nt\nX\ni=1\n\n(\u03b1i * Bi ),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere each coefficient \u03b1i is a constant weight, not necessarilyPpositive, for a given measurement Bi . The cont\ndition i=1 \u03b1i = 1 ensures that the method is unbiased.\nThe set of coefficients \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , ..., \u03b1t ) is calculated\nso that the variance of branching fraction is minimal,\n\u03b1=\n\nE \u22121 U\n,\nU T E \u22121 U\n\n(14)\n\nwhere U is a t-component vector whose elements are all\n1 (U T is its transpose) and E is the (t \u00d7 t) covariance\nmatrix. The variance of branching fraction is then given\nby\n\u03c3 2 = \u03b1T E\u03b1.\n\n(15)\n\nThe covariance matrix E is evaluated for each source of\nsystematics. Its matrix elements are, for two modes i and\nj,\nEij = \u03c1ij \u03c3i \u03c3j ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c3i and \u03c3j are the systematic uncertainties for the\nmodes i and j, and \u03c1ij is their correlation coefficient.\nWe distinguish several types of systematic uncertainties\naccording to their correlations between the modes:\n\u2022 full correlation, |\u03c1ij | \u223c 1: neutrals (but uncertainties for \u03c0 0 and single \u03b3 are independent), PID,\ntracking, number of BB, B(D\u22170 ), D\u22170 \u03c9 polarization in that mode,\n\u2022 medium correlation: B(D0 ), B(h0 ), whose correlations are taken from the PDG [26] and range from\n2% to 100%, D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 background in B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 0 ,\n\u2022 negligible correlation, |\u03c1ij | \u223c 0: statistical uncertainties, PDF systematics, selection of intermediate\nparticles, MC statistics.\nThe total covariance matrix E is then the sum of the covariance matrices for each source of uncertainty, plus the\ncovariance matrix associated to statistical uncertainties.\nThe systematic (statistical) uncertainty on the combined\nvalue of branching fraction computed by using Eq. (15)\nwhere the error matrix includes only the systematic (statistical) uncertainties.\nThe combined branching fractions in data are given\nin Table IV with the \u03c72 of the combination, the number of degrees of freedom of the combination (ndof), and\nthe corresponding probability (p-value). The individual\nbranching fractions together with the combined value are\n\ndisplayed in Figs. 5 and 6 and they are compared to the\nprevious measurements by CLEO [10], BABAR [7, 14], and\nBelle [11, 12].\nThe results of this analysis, based on a data sample of 454\u00d7106 BB pairs, are fully compatible with our\nprevious measurements [7, 14], and also with those of\nCLEO [10]. They are compatible with the measurements by Belle [11, 12] for most of the modes, except for\nB 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03b7, D\u22170 \u03c9, and D\u22170 \u03c0 0 , where our results are\nlarger. Those four branching fractions are from 2.5 to\n3.7 standard deviations (including systematic uncertainties) away from the latest measurements by Belle [11, 12].\nOur measurements are the most precise determinations\nof the B(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 ) from a single experiment. They\nrepresent significant improvements with respect to the\naccuracy of the existing PDG averages [26].\nAs a cross check we also perform the branching fractions measurements with the sub-data set of 88\u00d7106 BB\npairs that we previously studied [7]. When studying the\nsame decay modes we find values compatible with that of\nRef. [7] with both statistical and systematic uncertainties\nlowered by significant amounts. In addition to the benefit from improved procedures to reconstruct and analyze\nthe data, this updated analysis incorporates new decay\nmodes, higher signal efficiency, and better background\nrejection and modeling. We use additional control data\nsamples and measure directly in the data the relative ratio of the B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c1\u2212 backgrounds. This analysis\nemploys better fitting techniques and uses more sophisticated methods to combine the results obtained with the\nvarious sub-decay modes.\nVI.\n\nPOLARIZATION OF B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9\n\nThe polarization of the vector-vector (V V ) decay\nB 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 has never been measured. Until now, it was\nsupposed to be similar to that of the decay B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c1\u2212 ,\nbased on HQET and factorization-based arguments [36].\nThe angular distributions for the decay B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 are\ndescribed by three helicity amplitudes: the longitudinal\nH0 amplitude and the transverse H+ and H\u2212 amplitudes.\nIn the factorization description of B \u2192 V V decays, the\nlongitudinal component H0 is expected to be dominant,\nleading to the fraction of longitudinal polarization, defined as\nfL \u2261\n\n|H0 |2\n\u0393L\n,\n=\n2\n\u0393\n|H0 | + |H+ |2 + |H\u2212 |2\n\n(17)\n\npredicted to be close to unity [3, 37\u201339].\nSignificant transverse polarizations were measured in\nB \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 (see the review in [26]) and investigated as\npossible signs of New Physics [40], but could also be the\nresult of non-factorizable QCD effects [41]. Similar effects were studied in the context of SCET [22], and are\nexpected to arise in the B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 decay, in particular\nthrough enhanced electromagnetic penguin decays [42],\nleading to significative deviation of fL from unity. It has\n\n\f21\nalso been argued in SCET studies that non-trivial long\ndistance contributions to the B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 amplitude may\nallow a significant amount of transverse polarization of\nsimilar size to the longitudinal polarization, leading to a\nvalue fL \u223c 0.5.\nApart from the motivation of these phenomenological\nquestions, the uncertainty on the angular polarization\nof B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 affects the kinematic acceptance of this\ndecay channel and therefore would be the dominant contribution to the systematic effects for its B measurement.\nHence we measure the fraction of longitudinal polarization for this decay mode. The analysis is performed with\n\nB 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 candidates selected with the same requirements as for the B analysis described in the previous\nsections. We consider the sub-decays D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 and\nD0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and KS0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\nA.\n\nDescription of the method\n\nThe differential decay rate of B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 for the subdecay D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 is [43]\n\nd3 \u0393\n2\n2\n2\n\u2217\nd cos \u03b8D\u2217 d cos \u03b8\u03c9 d\u03c7 \u221d \u00024|H0 | cos \u03b8D cos \u03b8\u03c9 +\n\u0003\n\u2217\n\u2217\n|H+ |2 + |H\u2212 |2 + 2(Re(H+ H\u2212\n) cos 2\u03c7 \u2212 Im(H+ H\u2212\n) sin 2\u03c7) sin2 \u03b8D\u2217 sin2 \u03b8\u03c9 +\n(Re(H+ H0\u2217 + H\u2212 H0\u2217 ) cos \u03c7 \u2212 Im(H+ H0\u2217 \u2212 H\u2212 H0\u2217 ) sin \u03c7) sin 2\u03b8D\u2217 sin 2\u03b8\u03c9 ,\n\nwhere \u03b8D\u2217 (\u03b8\u03c9 ) is the helicity angle of the D\u2217 (\u03c9) meson (see Sec. III C 3 for definitions). The angle \u03c7, called\nthe azimuthal angle, is the angle between the D\u22170 and\n\u03c9 decay planes in the B 0 frame. Since the acceptance\nis nearly independent of \u03c7, one can integrate over \u03c7 to\nobtain a simplified expression:\nd2 \u0393\n\u221d 4|H0 |2 cos2 \u03b8D\u2217 cos2 \u03b8\u03c9\nd cos \u03b8D\u2217 d cos \u03b8\u03c9\n+(|H+ |2 + |H\u2212 |2 ) sin2 \u03b8D\u2217 sin2 \u03b8\u03c9 .\n\n(19)\n\nThis differential decay width is proportional to\n4fL cos2 \u03b8D\u2217 cos2 \u03b8\u03c9 + (1 \u2212 fL ) sin2 \u03b8D\u2217 sin2 \u03b8\u03c9 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is the weighted sum of purely longitudinal (fL = 1)\nand purely transverse (fL = 0) contributions.\nWe employ high statistics MC simulations of exclusive\nsignal samples of B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 decays with the two extreme configurations fL = 0 and 1 to estimate the ratio\nof signal acceptance, \u03b50 /\u03b51 , of fL = 0 events to fL = 1\nevents. The longitudinal fraction fL , can be expressed in\nterms of the fraction of background events (\u03b3) and the\nfraction of fL = 1 events in the observed data sample\n(\u03b1):\nfL =\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3) *\n\n\u03b50 .\n\u03b51\n\n(21)\n\nThe fraction \u03b3 is taken from the fit of \u2206E for a signal region |\u2206E| < 2.5 \u03c3\u2206E and mES > 5.27 GeV/c2 ,\nwhere \u03c3\u2206E is the fitted \u2206E width of the signal distribution, ranging from 20.8 to 23.3 MeV depending on the\nmode. The fraction \u03b1 is determined from a simultaneous 2-dimensional fit to the distributions of the helicity\n\n(18)\n\nangles cos \u03b8\u03c9 and cos \u03b8D\u2217 , for B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9 candidates selected in the same signal region. The correlation between\ncos \u03b8\u03c9 and cos \u03b8D\u2217 is found to be negligible.\n\nThe signal shapes are described with parabolas (see\nEq. (20)), except for the cos \u03b8\u03c9 distribution of fL = 0\nsignal events, which is described by a non-parametric\nPDF based on the MC simulation. As the signal distribution of cos \u03b8\u03c9 is distorted around zero because of\nthe selection cut on pion momentum and on the \u03c9 boost\n(see Sec. III B 3). The signal PDF parameters are fixed\nto those fitted on the D\u22170 \u03c9 simulations. The shape\nof the cos \u03b8\u03c9 and cos \u03b8D\u2217 background distributions is\ntaken from the data sideband |\u2206E| < 280 MeV and\n5.235 < mES < 5.270 GeV/c2 . The consistency of the\nbackground shape was checked and validated for various\nregions of the sidebands in data and generic MC simulations. Possible biases on fL from the fit are investigated\nwith pseudo-experiment studies for various values of fL\nfrom 5 to 95 %. No significant biases are observed.\n\nAn additional study is performed with an embedded\nsignal MC simulation, i.e. with signal events modeled\nfrom various different fully simulated signal samples and\nwith a generated value fL \u2243 90% (as expected from\nHQET [36, 44]). A small bias on the fitted value of\nfL is observed (\u223c 14% of the statistical uncertainty).\nThis bias is due to the slight difference on the description of the signal shape for the cos \u03b8\u03c9 distribution and\nfor fL = 0, modeled by a non-parametric PDF, and that\nof the actual shape obtained from the embedded signal\nMC simulation.

The dots with error bars are data,\nthe curves are the various PDF contributions: the solid blue (blue) is the total PDF, the dash-dot (grey) is the background\ncontribution, the long dash (blue) is the fL = 1 signal part and the dots (red) is the fL = 0 signal.\n\nB.\n\nStatistical and systematic uncertainties\n\nThe statistical uncertainty on fL is estimated with\na conservative approach by varying independently the\nvalues of the two fitted parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3 by \u00b11 \u03c3\nin Eq. (21). An extended study based on MC pseudoexperiments accounting for the correlations between \u03b1\nand \u03b3 gave slightly smaller uncertainty.\nThe uncertainty due to the signal shape in the simultaneous 2-dimensional fit to cos \u03b8\u03c9 and cos \u03b8D\u2217 is measured using the control sample B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 \u2212 , with\nD\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 and D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . This mode was chosen for its high purity and for its longitudinal fraction\nfL = 1, which enables us to directly compare its shape\nto our signal fL = 1. The distribution of the helicity angle of the D\u22170 is found to be wider in the data than in the\nMC, this difference being parameterized by a parabola.\nThe uncertainty on the signal shape is then measured by\nrefitting \u03b1, with the signal PDF being multiplied by the\ncorrection parabola. The relative difference is then taken\nas the uncertainty.\nWe assign a systematic effect due to the correction that\n\nwe apply for the observed small bias on the value for fL ,\nwhen fitting the embedded signal MC simulation (see the\ndiscussion at the end of Sect. VI A).\nThe uncertainty due to the background shape is measured by refitting \u03b1 with the background shape fitted in\na lower data sideband |\u2206E| < 280 MeV and 5.200 <\nmES < 5.235 GeV/c2 . The relative difference is then\ntaken as the uncertainty.\nAn uncertainty is assigned to fL due to the assumption\nof the acceptance being independent of \u03c7. The acceptance of the MC simulation signal is measured in bins of\n\u03c7 and fitted with a Fourier series to account for any deviation from flatness. The resulting fitted function is used\nas a parametrization of the acceptance dependency to \u03c7\nand multiplied to the decay rate (as written in Eq. (19)).\nWe then perform in a study based on pseudo-MC simulation experiments where the events are generated from\nthis new decay rate. The resulting cos \u03b8\u03c9 \u00d7 cos \u03b8D\u2217 distributions are fitted with the procedure described above.\nA small bias is observed and its value is assigned as a\nsystematic effect.\nThe uncertainty on the efficiency ratio \u03b50 /\u03b51 , from the\n\n\f23\nTABLE V: Total relative uncertainties computed in data on\nthe measurement of fL in the decay channel B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9,\nwith D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 and D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\nand KS0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\nSources\n\n\u2206fL /fL (%)\nK\u03c0 K3\u03c0 K\u03c0\u03c0 0 KS0 \u03c0\u03c0\n\nSignal PDFs\nCorrection of the bias\nBackground PDF\nLimited MC statistics\nFlat acceptance vs. \u03c7\n\n2.5\n1.0\n0.3\n0.1\n1.5\n\n2.9\n1.3\n4.2\n0.2\n1.8\n\n2.4\n2.0\n3.6\n0.3\n0.5\n\n2.3\n2.3\n4.0\n0.3\n6.9\n\nTotal systematic\n\n3.1\n\n5.6\n\n4.8\n\n8.6\n\nStatistical uncertainty\n\n9.6 16.3 16.3\n\n25.6\n\nTotal uncertainty\n\n10.0 17.2 17.0\n\n27.0\n\nTABLE VI: Values of \u03b1 fitted in data, of the background\nfraction \u03b3 and of the acceptance ratio \u03b50 /\u03b51 , with the corresponding values of the longitudinal fraction fL after the bias\ncorrection.

The dominant uncertainty is statistical. Among the various systematic\nsources, the largest contribution comes from the signal\nand background parametrizations, and for some modes\non the assumption of a flat acceptance versus \u03c7.\nAs a check, the fL measurement is applied in data\nfirst on the high purity and high statistics control sample B \u2212 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c0 \u2212 , with D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 0 and D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + .\nThis decay channel is longitudinally polarized, i.e. fL =\n1.

The measurements for each\nD0 decay channel are then combined with the BLUE statistical method [35] (see Sec. V) with \u03c72 /ndof = 1.01/3\n(i.e.: a probability of 79.9%).

It should\nbe noted that the values of these ratios are not computed\ndirectly from those quoted in Table IV, as we take advantage of the fact that common systematic uncertainties\ncancel between D0 h0 and D\u22170 h0 modes. Therefore the\nratios of the B are first calculated for each sub-decays of\nD0 and h0 , and then combined with the BLUE method.\nThe ratios B(B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 h0 )/B(B 0 \u2192 D0 h0 ) for h0 = \u03c0 0 ,\n\u03b7, and \u03b7 \u2032 are compatible with 1. All are displayed in\nFig. 9 together with the theoretical predictions.\n\u2192\nFactorization predicts the ratio B(B 0\n(\u2217)0 \u2032\nD\n\u03b7 )/B(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03b7) to have a value between\n0.64 and 0.68 [49], related to the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing.\nThose ratios are also given in Table VIII and Fig. 10\ncompares the theoretical predictions with our experimental measurements. The measured ratios are\nsmaller than the predictions and are compatible\nat the level of less than two standard deviations.\nThe SCET gives also a prediction about the ratio\nB(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03b7 \u2032 )/B(B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03b7) \u2243 0.67, which is\nsimilar to the prediction by factorization.\nSCET [20\u201322] does not predict the absolute value\nof the B but it predicts that the ratios B(B 0 \u2192\nD\u22170 h0 )/B(B 0 \u2192 D0 h0 ) are about equal to one for h0 =\n\u03c0 0 , \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 . For h0 = \u03c9 that prediction holds only for\nthe longitudinal component of B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9, as non trivial\nlong-distance QCD interactions may increase the transverse amplitude. We measure the fraction of longitudinal\npolarization to be fL = (66.5 \u00b1 4.7(stat.) \u00b1 1.5(syst.))%\nin the decay mode B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9, and find that the ratio B(B 0 \u2192 D\u22170 \u03c9)/B(B 0 \u2192 D0 \u03c9) is significantly higher\nthan one, as expected by SCET [22].\n\nVIII.\n\nFactorization\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe measure the branching fractions of the colorsuppressed decays B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 , where h0 = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7,\n\u03c9, and \u03b7 \u2032 with 454\u00d7106BB pairs.

This reinforces the conclusion drawn from the B measurements on the validity\nof factorisation in color-suppressed decays and supports\nexpectations from SCET.\nWe confirm the significant differences from theoretical\npredictions by factorization and provide strong constraints on the models of color-suppressed decays. In\nparticular our results support most of the predictions of\nSCET on B 0 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 h0 [20\u201322].\n\n\f26\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful for the extraordinary contributions of\nour PEP-II colleagues in achieving the excellent luminosity and machine conditions that have made this work possible.
