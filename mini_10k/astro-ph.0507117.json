The probe of interior properties is based on\nthe accurate determination of the four parameters, i, \u03c60 , J2 and C22 , where i is Mercury's\nobliquity, \u03c60 is the amplitude of the physical libration in longitude, and J2 and C22 are the\nsecond degree harmonic coefficients in the expansion of Mercury's gravitational field. These\nparameters are sufficient for determining the factors in the equation (Peale, 1976a; 1981;\n1988; Peale et al. 2002)\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\nCm\nB\u2212A\nCm\nMM R2\n=\n\u2264 1,\n(1)\n2\nB\u2212A\nMM R\nC\nC\nwhere MM and R are the mass and radius of Mercury, A < B < C are the principal moments\nof inertia, and Cm is the polar moment of inertia of the mantle alone.\nThe first factor follows from the amplitude of the physical libration\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n3 B\u2212A\n959 4\n2\n\u03c60 =\n1 \u2212 11e +\ne +*** ,\n2\nCm\n48\n\n(2)\n\nwhere e is the orbital eccentricity, and Cm occurs in the denominator because a liquid core is\nnot expected to follow the 88 day physical libration of the mantle. The second factor follows\nfrom\nB\u2212A\n= 4C22 ,\n(3)\nMM R2\nand the third from (Peale, 1969)\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n123\n7\n3\ne\u2212\ne\nJ2 /(1 \u2212 e2 )3/2 + 2C22\nC\nn\n2\n16\n=\n,\n2\nMM R\n(sin I)/ic \u2212 cos I\n\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ic is the obliquity of Cassini state 1, (E.g., Colombo, 1966:, Peale, 1969), which\nMercury is expected to occupy (i = ic ), I is the inclination of the orbit plane to the Laplace\nplane on which Mercury's orbit precesses at the constant rate \u2212\u03bc, and n is the orbital mean\nmotion, and the equation assumes ic \u226a 1. In a Cassini state the spin axis is coplanar with\nthe normal to the Laplace plane and the orbit normal as both the spin and the orbit normal\nprecess around the Laplace plane normal with an approximately 280,000 year period. Fig. 1\nshows the configuration for Cassini state 1, where the ascending node of the equator plane on\nthe orbit plane remains coincident with the ascending node of the orbit plane on the Laplace\nplane. In Fig. 1, the Z axis is normal to the orbit plane, the Y axis is in the orbit plane, and\nthe X axis comes out of the paper. Eq. (4) shows the dependence of C/MM R2 on J2 , C22\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand ic , and together, the last three equations show the necessity of knowing ic , \u03c60 , J2 and\nC22 to determine Cm /C.\n[Figure 1]\nConditions for the success of the experiment are\n1) The liquid core must not follow the mantle during the 88 day forced libration in longitude.\n2) The core must follow the mantle during the 280,000 year orbit precession, where the spin\naxis is locked to this precession if it occupies the Cassini state.\n3) B \u2212 A must be due to the mantle alone.\n4) Adiabatic invariance must keep the spin close to the Cassini state during the slow variation\nof the orbital elements.\nThe first two conditions are satisfied for viscous core-mantle coupling, topographical\ncoupling due to core-mantle boundary (CMB) irregularities, magnetic core-mantle coupling,\nand gravitational coupling between an axially asymmetric solid inner core and the mantle\n(Peale, et al. 2002). The third condition requires that there not be long wavelength irregularities in the CMB such that dense core material contributes to B \u2212 A. Such irregularities\ncould be induced by mantle convection (D. Stevenson, private communication, 2003), but a\nmajor contribution to B \u2212 A would occur only if the convective cells have circumferential\nscales comparable to the planet radius R. Otherwise, the plus and minus contributions due\nto short wavelength topography would tend to average to a zero total contribution to B \u2212 A.\nAs the iron core must be near 0.75R in radius (Siegfried and Solomon, 1974), the horizontal\nscale of any convective cells is unlikely to greatly exceed the 0.25R thickness of the mantle.\nIt has also been argued that Mercury's mantle convection ceased early in Mercury's history\n(Reese and Peterson, 2002), and the CMB should thereby be nearly axially symmetric with\nlittle or no contribution to B \u2212 A from the core.\nIt is implicitly assumed in the above that all free motions associated with Mercury's spin\nare damped to near zero amplitude, and that the spin remains close to the current location\nof Cassini state 1 in spite of slow variation of the orbital parameters that define the state.\nThe free motions include a free libration in longitude, a free precession of the spin about\nCassini state 1, and a free wobble. The free libration in longitude results when the axis of\nminimum moment of inertia does not point toward the Sun when Mercury is at perihelion.\nThe gravitational torque on the permanent asymmetry of the planet, averaged around the\norbit, tends to restore the alignment of the axis of minimum moment of inertia with the\nSun at perihelion because of the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, so viewed at perihelion, the long\naxis will tend to librate about the direction toward the Sun with a period of about 10 years.\nThe free precession of the spin axis is like the 26,000 year precession of the Earth's spin axis\nabout the ecliptic, except the precession is about the Cassini state instead of the orbit normal,\nwhere the deviation of the Cassini state from the orbit normal is less than 2 arcmin. The\nperiod of this precession is O(1000 years). Free wobble or non principal axis rotation occurs\nwhen the spin axis does not coincide with the axis of maximum moment of inertia. The\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nspin axis then precesses around the axis of maximum moment of inertia in the body frame\nof reference with a period O(500 years). The wobble is analogous to the Chandler wobble\nof the Earth. The angular momentum is conserved during free wobble, and the spin axis\nmakes only small excursions relative to inertial space. The spin angular momentum is not\nconserved during the free libration and free precession as the planet responds to the external\ngravitational torque due to the Sun. In the former the spin axis direction is maintained as\nthe magnitude of the spin varies periodically, whereas in the latter the spin describes a cone\nabout the Cassini state, which is almost a cone relative to inertial space.\nThe term \"free\" characterizes these motions as having arbitrary phases and amplitudes,\nwhich amplitudes, if significantly different from zero, could complicate the interpretation\nof the spacecraft and radar data constraining the properties of the interior. For example,\na finite amplitude free precession would displace Mercury's spin vector from the Cassini\nstate, and its arbitrary phase and amplitude would thereby increase the uncertainty in the\nobliquity of the state used in determining C/MM R2 in Eq. (4). Tidal friction has been shown\nto carry the spin to Cassini state 1 from almost any initial configuration on a time scale that\nis short compared to the age of the solar system (Peale, 1974; Ward, 1975). Free libration in\nlongitude (9.2 year period, for (B \u2212A)/Cm = 3.5 \u00d710\u22124 ) is similarly damped, but such a free\nlibration does not confuse the experiment, as the 88 day forced libration is superposed on the\nfree libration (Peale, et al. 2002), and its amplitude is readily discernible. Any free wobble\nwill also damp due to dissipation by internal friction as the equator plane changes relative\nto the body principal axis system in addition to tidal friction and core-mantle dissipation.\nFor the Moon, tidal dissipation is about 4 times more effective than the dissipation caused\nby the changing orientation of the equator (Peale, 1976b). Finally it was asserted (Peale,\n1974) that the spin would remain close to the instantaneous position of the Cassini state if\nit were ever close because of the adiabatic invariance of an action integral that is equivalent\nto the solid angle swept out by the spin vector as it precesses around the Cassini state.\nIf, on the other hand, free motions of measurable amplitude are found, excitation mechanisms must be sought given the damping. Relatively small amplitudes of free motions can\nbe detected by orbiting spacecraft (Zuber and Smith, 2000) and radar (Holin, 2003; Margot\net al. 2003). The damping time scales constrain the types of excitation mechanisms that\nare likely to be responsible. For example, short time scales make excitation by the impact of\nlarge objects less likely (See Section 4). The existence of a liquid core introduces damping\nby core-mantle interaction that shortens the time scales for the damping of free motions\ndeduced for tidal dissipation. This paper is the first of three where we consider the free\nmotions and quantify the adiabatic invariance of the spin axis separation from the Cassini\nstate. Here we derive and compare damping time scales for the two processes of tidal friction and core-mantle dissipation with viscous coupling for free libration and free precession.\nQuantifying the adiabatic invariance and determining the damping of a free wobble require\ndifferent approaches, and these will be considered in the following papers. The damping of\nthe free rotational motions of the Moon have been determined earlier using a Hamiltonian\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nformulation with dissipation accounted for by introducing phase lags in the periodic terms\ndescribing the response of the Moon to various forcing potentials (Peale, 1976b). This analysis is general albeit somewhat complicated. For the libration and precession considered here\nwe use a much simpler approach by fixing the orbit and writing the equations of motion\ndirectly in terms of the external and internal torques on the mantle and core. However, this\nsimplified approach will not work well for the wobble, so the general Hamiltonian analysis\nwill be used in a following paper to treat the wobble damping, although the torque equations\nwill be applied there for the core-mantle coupling. In Sections 2 and 3, we show that the\ndamping times for the free precession and the free libration in longitude are both near 105\nyears with the core-mantle interaction being between one and two orders of magnitude more\neffective than tidal friction. In Section 4 we show that the time between impacts capable of\ngenerating observable amplitudes of free libration or precession exceeds 109 years, making\nsuch excitation exceeding unlikely. Summary and conclusions follow in Section 5. We begin\nwith the free precession, as the equations describing the damping of the libration in longitude\nare scalar versions of those describing the damping of the precession.\n\n2.\n\nDamping of free precession\n\nGenerally, the spin axis precesses about Cassini state 1 which is offset approximately\n1.7 arcmin from the orbit normal. However, for the purposes of calculating the damping, we\nassume the orbit is fixed, so that the precession will be about the orbit normal. (The Cassini\nstate for a fixed orbit can be thought to coincide with the orbit normal, since the state\napproaches the orbit normal as the orbital precession rate is decreased, or it can be thought\nnot to exist at all.) Accordingly, we adopt an XY Z inertial system centered on Mercury\nwith the XY plane coincident with the orbit plane, the X axis pointing from Mercury to\nthe perihelion of the Sun's relative orbit, and with unit vector eo = eZ being the orbit\nnormal. During the precession about the orbit normal, the damping of the precession angle\nabout the orbit normal will be essentially the same as the damping of the precession about\nthe Cassini state without involving the complications induced by the orbit precession. (See\nPeale, (1976b) for a complete analysis applied to the Moon.)\nWe assume that the core mantle interaction is simply proportional to the difference in\nthe vector spin angular velocities of the mantle and core as the simplest possible coupling.\nThis coupling is consistent with a viscous coupling between two rigid spheres. Mercury is\nrotating slowly enough such that pressure coupling of the core and mantle from the elliptical\nshape of the core-mantle boundary is not important, which leaves viscous coupling the most\nprobable. We also assume principal axis rotation.

The z axis is the axis of maximum moment of inertia coincident with the spin\naxis, and x and y are axes of minimum and intermediate moments of inertia in the equator\nplane. We define m\u0302 = ez as a unit vector along the spin axis of the mantle. The xyz axes\nare oriented with respect to the XY Z axes through Euler angles \u03a9, i, \u03c8m as shown in Fig.\n2, where \u03a9 is the longitude of the ascending node of the equator on the orbit plane, i is the\nobliquity, and \u03c8m is the angle between the node and the x axis in the equator plane, with\nthe subscript m again referring to the mantle.\n[Figure 2]\n~ in spherical coordinates relative to the body axes (Eq.

(11) describe the retrograde precession of m\u0302 about the orbit\nnormal, but now with a rate that varies with twice the precession frequency. The triple\ncross product term varies the obliquity i with the same frequency. Recall that the longitude\nof the ascending node of the equator on the orbit plane \u03a9 is measured from the perihelion\ndirection. The precession rate is minimal when \u03a9 = 0 or \u03c0 and maximal when \u03a9 = \u00b1\u03c0/2.\nThe former corresponds to the node of the equator plane being parallel to the line of apsides\nsuch that at the perihelion, the torque due the axial asymmetry of Mercury (K2 has C22\nas a factor.) vanishes. When \u03a9 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, the node is perpendicular to the line of apsides,\nand at perihelion, the long axis is tilted the maximum amount relative to the orbit plane.\nThe torque and hence the averaged precession rate is thus maximal for this phase, since the\nbiggest torque due to the egg shape of Mercury comes at the perihelion when the long axis\nis tipped above or below the plane of the orbit while still being oriented toward the Sun\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nas closely as possible because of the spin-orbit resonance. For \u03a9 = 0 or \u03c0, the opportunity\nfor the Sun to exert a large torque on the axial asymmetry at perihelion is lost, and so the\naverage of the torque around the orbit is minimal.\nThe triple product term in Eq. (11) lies along the projection of the spin vector m\u0302 on\nthe orbit plane. So for \u03c0/2 > \u03a9 > 0 the obliquity is increasing, whereas it is decreasing for\n0 > \u03a9 > \u2212\u03c0/2. Hence, the obliquity has a minimum when the spin is crossing the X axis\n(\u03a9 = \u00b1\u03c0/2) and a maximum when it crosses the Y axis (\u03a9 = 0 or \u03c0). The precession rate is\nmaximal when the obliquity is minimal and vice versa, and the precession path of the spin\nis elliptical with the long axis along the Y axis. The reader will notice that there is also a\ncomponent of the triple vector product torque that is parallel to m\u0302. This component may\nnot be real because of the approximations involved in arriving at Eq. (9), but if it is real,\nthere may be a displacement of the center of physical libration as a function of precessional\nphase.\nA good approximation to the precessional motion can be obtained by neglecting the\nlast term in Eq. (9), since it is O(i2 ) smaller than the next smallest term. With m\u0302 =\nsin i sin \u03a9 eX \u2212 sin i cos \u03a9 eY + cos i eZ , we can write Eq. (9) in still another way with a\nrearrangement of terms,\n~\nhNi\n=\nCm \u03c8\u0307m\n\n\u0015\n(1 + mZ )\nmY eX\nK1 mZ + K3 (1 \u2212 mZ ) \u2212 K2\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nK2 (1 + mZ )\n\u2212 K1 mZ + K3 (1 \u2212 mZ ) +\nmX eY ,\n2\n\u0014\n\n(13)\n\nwhere mX,Y,Z are the respective components of m\u0302.

With Cm = 0.18MM R2 ,\n\u03c8\u0307 = 1.5n, J2 = 6\u00d710\u22125 , and C22 = 1\u00d710\u22125 (Anderson et al. 1987), K1 = 1.117\u00d710\u22122rad/yr\nand K2 = 8.391\u00d710\u22125 rad/yr, the precession period of Mercury's spin about the orbit normal\n(or the Cassini state) is 562 years. If Cm = 0.16MM R2 , the precession period would be\nreduced to 500 years. If the core were solid and C = 0.33MM R2 , the precession period would\nbe 1031 years. This compares to a 1066 year period obtained numerically by Rambaux and\nBois (2004). The ratio of the axes of the p\nellipse traced out by the projection of the spin\nmax\nmax\nvector on the orbit plane is mY /mX = (K1 + K2 )/(K1 \u2212 K2 ) = 1.0075. This solution\nis consistent with the deductions about the precession from Eq.

The dissipation parameter Q for an system oscillating at frequency \u03c9 is defined by\n(e.g. Lambeck, 1980 p 14)\nI\ndE\ndt\n1\ndt\n=\n= \u03c9\u2206t,\n(22)\nQ\n2\u03c0E \u2217\nwhere the numerator is the energy dissipated during a complete cycle of oscillation and E \u2217 is\nthe maximum energy stored during the cycle. For a tidally distorted, nearly spherical body\nwith the disturbing body in a circular equatorial orbit, a cycle would consist of half a rotation\nof the distorted body relative to the body causing the tide. For a complex tide generated by\na non circular, non equatorial orbit of the disturbing body, each periodic term in a Fourier\ndecomposition of the tide would have its own maximum stored energy and dissipation over\na complete cycle of oscillation.\nThe response of an oscillator with forcing function F = A\u2032 sin \u03c9t when \u03c9 \u226a \u03c90 , with\n\u03c90 being the lowest frequency of free oscillation, can be represented by x = B \u2032 sin \u03c9(t \u2212 \u2206t),\nwhere \u2206t is the phase lag in the response due to the dissipation as was assumed above for\nthe tidal response. The rate at which the forcing function does work is dE/dt = F \u1e8b =\nA\u2032 B \u2032 \u03c9 sin \u03c9t cos \u03c9(t \u2212 \u2206t). Then\nZ t\nh \u2212 cos (2\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c9\u2206t) sin \u03c9\u2206t it\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+\nt .\n(23)\nE(t) =\nF \u1e8bdt = A B \u03c9\n4\u03c9\n2\nt1\nt1\nThe first term in Eq. (23) is the periodic storage of energy in the oscillator, and the second\nis the secular loss of energy. The maximum energy stored is just twice the coefficient of the\ncosine term, E \u2217 = A\u2032 B \u2032 /2, and the energy dissipated during a complete period of 2\u03c0/\u03c9 is\n\u2206E = A\u2032 B \u2032 \u03c0\u03c9\u2206t with sin \u03c9\u2206t \u2248 \u03c9\u2206t. We use the energy stored as the energy increment\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nabove the minimum energy in the first term since the stored tidal energy will always be an\nincrease over the relaxed spherical shape of the body. Hence 1/Q = \u03c9\u2206t as indicated in\nEq. (22). Since \u2206t is independent of frequency, Q is inversely proportional to frequency in\nthis model. For Earth like materials, Q is almost independent of frequency for a wide range\nof frequencies above typical tidal frequencies (Knopoff, 1964), but to avoid a step function\nreversal in torque when a tidal frequency changes sign, it is not unlikely that the above\nfrequency dependence will prevail for the small tidal frequencies.\nQ = 100 is typical of Earth-like materials (Knopoff, 1964) and apparently for Phobos\ngenerated tides on Mars (Smith and Born, 1976). For Mars the dominant frequency is\n\u03c9 = 2(\u03c8\u0307 \u2212 nP ), where \u03c8\u0307 is Mars rotational angular velocity and nP is Phobos' mean orbital\nmotion. The factor 2 follows from there being two tidal cycles for each synodic period. With\na rotation period of 24h 37m 23s and an orbital period of 0.319 days, \u03c9 = 3.14 \u00d7 10\u22124 rad/s\nleading to \u2206t \u2248 32 seconds for Q = 100. For Mercury, the fundamental tidal period is\nthe orbit period, since Mercury rotates 180\u25e6 relative to the Sun for each orbit. Although\none might infer that Q is inversely proportional to frequency near a particular frequency to\nsmooth the transition from positive to negative frequency, it cannot be the case that the\nsame proportionality constant will apply over a very wide range of frequency as indicated\nby Q \u2248 100 nearly independent of frequency between approximately 10 and 106 cps for\nEarth materials (Knopoff, 1964).

Here\n\u03c8\u0307m = 1.5n, Rc = 0.75R is Mercury's core radius (Siegfried and Solomon, 1987), \u03a9\u0307 =\n(2\u03c0/562) yr\u22121 and C \u2032 = Cc /Cm \u2248 1.

(1998). If we\nchoose \u03bd = 0.01 cm2 /sec, then \u03b1 = 2k \u2032 = 1.72 \u00d7 10\u22123, and its square can be neglected in the\ndenominator of the first term on the right of Eq. (37). With P = 88 days, R = 2439 km,\nCm = 0.18MM R2 , MM = 3.302 \u00d7 1026 g, the time scale for damping Mercury's free precession\nbecomes\n89 years\n.\n(40)\n\u03c4prec =\n\u22123\n1/2\n8.59 \u00d7 10 \u03bd + 8.08 \u00d7 10\u22123 k2 /Q0\nTheoretical values of Mercury's k2 \u2248 0.3 to 0.4 (Spohn et al. 2001; Van Hoolst and Jacobs,\n2003), and Q0 \u2248 100 is typical for Mars and Earth (Smith and Born, 1976; Knopoff, 1964)\nsuch that k2 /Q0 = 0.004 is a plausible value. With \u03bd = 0.01 cm2 /sec, we find \u03c4prec \u2248\n1.00 \u00d7 105 years under the action of both tidal dissipation and core mantle interaction, and\n\u03c4prec = 1.04 \u00d7 105 years and \u03c4prec = 2.76 \u00d7 106 years for core-mantle interaction and tidal\ndissipation respectively if they acted alone.\nThe development of Eqs. (5) for numerical integration is given in Appendix A. An\nadvantage of a numerical approach is that the consequences for the damping of large values\nof \u03bd, where the approximations used above are not valid, can be determined. Since, \u03bd \u226b 0.01\nis unlikely, we shall not show the damping histories for large \u03bd, but remark that the damping\ntime scale is a minimum for \u03bd \u2248 1000 cm2 /sec where the precession amplitude is nearly\ncritically damped. For larger \u03bd the coupling is sufficiently strong that the core nearly follows\nthe mantle as both precess together and the precession period increases from 562 years\nto somewhat over 1000 years appropriate for a solid planet. The damping time scale for\nthe precession amplitude is similarly increased from the minimum as \u03bd is increased. The\nGreenspan and Howard spin-up time scale in Eq. (38) also must be replaced by a viscous\ntime scale for large \u03bd in relating \u03bd to k \u2032 .\nIn Fig. 3 we demonstrate that the same time scale for damping the precession amplitude from the combination of core-mantle and tidal dissipation is obtained numerically\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nas analytically for the same \u03bd = 0.01 cm2 /sec and k2 /Q0 = 0.004. If we set k = 0, the\ndamping time estimated numerically similarly to Fig. 3 is \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 106 years compared to\n2.76 \u00d7106 years determined analytically, which confirms the analytic development. Damping\ntime scales for reasonable choices of \u03bd and k2 /Q0 are all short compared to the solar system\nage, so we would expect the free precession to be completely damped, barring excitation by\nan unspecified mechanism.\n[Figure 3]\n\n3.\n\nDamping of free libration\n\nThe treatment of the libration damping is considerably simpler than that of the precession amplitude as we can assume zero obliquity as well as principal axis rotation. Eqs. (5)\nstill apply, but are now scalar equations since there are only torques about the Z axis, which\nis now coincident with the z axis. With r\u0302 \u00d7 r\u0302 \u0307 = \u2212(\u03c8\u0307m \u2212 f \u0307)ez , we can write\nCm \u03c8\u0308m = N + T \u2212 k(\u03c8\u0307m \u2212 \u03c8\u0307c ),\n\n3k2 GM\u22992 R5\n3\nGM\u2299\n= \u2212 (B \u2212 A) 3 sin 2\u03be \u2212\n2\nr\nr 6 Q0\n\nCc \u03c8\u0308c = k(\u03c8\u0307m \u2212 \u03c8\u0307c ),\n\n\u03c8\u0307m \u2212 f \u0307\nn\n\n!\n\n\u2212 k(\u03c8\u0307m \u2212 \u03c8\u0307c ),\n(41)\n\nwhere C22 = (B \u2212 A)/(4MM R2 ) has been used. The relations between f, \u03c6, \u03be, and \u03c8m are\nshown in Fig. 4, where the X axis is now drawn from the Sun to the perihelion with line\nSM drawn from the Sun to Mercury. The angles are linked to the orbital motion through\n\u03c8m = \u03be + f , where f is the true anomaly.\n[Figure 4]\nMercury's rotation deviates from \u03c8\u0307m = 1.5n by only a small amount, where \u03c8\u0307m is\n~ \u0307m . We therefore write \u03b3\u0307m = \u03c8\u0307m \u2212 1.5n as the deviation of the spin\nthe magnitude of \u03c8\nfrom the mean value. The angular deviation of, say, Mercury's axis of minimum moment\nof inertia (\"long axis\") from the position it would have had if the rotation were uniform is\nthen \u03b3m = \u03c8m \u2212 1.5M, where M = nt is the mean anomaly. \u03b3m is thus the angle between\nMercury's long axis and the direction to the Sun when Mercury is at perihelion.

We have made the equation dimensionless by dividing by n2 and letting\nnt = M \u2192 t. Also, sin 2\u03b3m \u2192 2\u03b3m , cos 2\u03b3m \u2192 1 have been used, and a Fourier series in t\nmultiplied by \u03b3m has been omitted from the right hand side of the equation, since it is so\nmuch smaller than the unit coefficient of the displayed series.\nIf we neglect the weak tidal and core-mantle torques for the moment, Eq.(43) is a simple\nforced harmonic oscillator equation describing the free and forced librations of longitude for\nMercury. The amplitude of the sin 2t term is about 11% of that of the sin t term and\nhigher order terms are even less. Since the overall amplitude of the physical libration is not\nchanged by this second term in the series, and higher order terms contribute negligibly, we\nretain only the sin t in defining the amplitude of the physical libration in Eq. (2). Although\nthis truncation of the series gives a reasonably good approximation to the physical libration\nangle, it gives a poor representation of the deviation of the angular velocity from the mean\nvalue. This is shown in Fig. 5 where the flat tops on the angular velocity curve at perihelion\nresult from the fact that the orbital angular velocity is close to the spin angular velocity\nnear perihelion, and with the long axis nearly aligned with the direction to the Sun during\nthis time, the torque on the axial asymmetry is nearly zero. A detailed explanation of the\nbehavior of d\u03c8m /dt near the perihelion is given in Appendix B.\n[Figure 5]\nThe free libration is treated by averaging Eq.

T is replaced by its averaged\nvalue hT i and \u03b3\u0307m and \u03b3\u0307c are uniform on the orbital time scale.

Similar to the\ntreatment of the precession, the fact that the tidal and core-mantle torques on the mantle\nare small means that the mantle will librate almost as it would if k and F were zero.

Subtracting the second of Eqs. (45) from the first yields an equation for\n\u2032\n\u03b4 = \u03b3\u0307m\n\u2212 \u03b3\u0307c\u2032 .\n1 + C\u2032\nd\u03b4\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+\nk\n\u03b4\u0307 = \u2212\u03b3\u0307m0\nsin t\u2032 \u2212 F \u2032 (V + x\u03b3\u0307m0\ncos t\u2032 ),\n(46)\ndt\u2032\nC\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere we have substituted the zero order solutions\nfor \u03b3m and \u03b3\u0307m\non the right. Now F \u2032 =\np\n1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 k2 /Q0 , where we have used x =\n3(B \u2212 A)(7e/2 \u2212 123e3 /16)/Cm = 0.0262,\nCm = 0.18MM R2 , inferred from Siegfried and Solomon (1974), (B \u2212 A)/Cm = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\nand Mercury's mass MM = 3.302 \u00d7 1026 g. The coefficient of cos t\u2032 in Eq. (46) is a factor of\n3.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 less than the coefficient of sin t\u2032 so we can neglect the former term.

Tidal friction displaces the zero point of\nthe libration by \u2212F \u2032 V /(1 + C \u2032) = 1.83 \u00d7 10\u22123 k2 /Q0 = 7.34 \u00d7 10\u22126 radians or \u223c 1.5 arcsec for\nk2 /Q0 = 0.004 (x = 0.0262, V = 0.244). A measure of this displacement would determine\nk2 /Q0 for Mercury. (Tidal friction attempts to slow Mercury's spin to a value that is less\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthan the current 1.5n, so at perihelion, the axis of minimum moment of inertia is displaced\nfrom exact alignment with the Sun (\u03b3m \u2261 0) until the averaged torque on the permanent\ndeformation balances the tidal torque and keeps the spin at the resonant rate.)\nThe time scale \u03c4lib for damping the free libration amplitude is twice the inverse of the\ncoefficient of \u03b3\u0307m in Eq. (48). The transient part of the expression for \u03b4 in Eq. (47) is\nthe same as that for the precession analysis, so the coupling constant k \u2032 is related to the\nkinematic viscosity of the core by Eq. (39), except \u03a9\u0307 must be replaced by xn.

(1998) along with k2 /Q0 = 0.004 discussed above, we find\n\u03c4lib \u2248 1.86 \u00d7 105 years under the action of both tidal dissipation and core mantle interaction,\nand \u03c4lib = 2.07 \u00d7 105 years and \u03c4lib = 1.86 \u00d7 106 years for core-mantle interaction and tidal\ndissipation respectively if they acted alone. Eqs. (41) are numerically integrated in Fig. 6\nfor \u03bd = 0.01 cm2 /sec and k2 /Q0 = 0.004, where the short period fluctuations in Fig. 6 are\nthe 88 day forced librations superposed on the free libration. The approximately determined\ntime scale is 1.8 \u00d7 105 years, which is close to the analytic value of 1.86 \u00d7 105 years. Damping\ntime scales for reasonable choices of \u03bd and k2 /Q0 are all short compared to the solar system\nage, so we would expect the free librations to be completely damped, barring excitation by\nan unspecified mechanism.\n[Figure 6]\n\n4.\n\nConsequences of Impact\n\nThis is an exercise to determine what size impactor would be necessary to generate an\nobservable free libration or free precession. We shall assume Mercury has no free motions\nprior to the impact, and that there is a complete transfer to Mercury of the entire angular\nmomentum of the impactor relative to the center of mass of Mercury. If the impact ejecta\nis distributed symmetrically about the point of impact, it will carry away little angular\nmomentum. This approximate conservation of angular momentum allows us to infer that\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nthe angular increment in the amplitude of the precession is simply the component of the\nimpactor angular momentum that is perpendicular to the spin axis divided by the spin\nangular momentum Cm \u03c8\u0307m . The increment in the free libration amplitude follows easily\nfrom the parallel component of the impactor angular momentum. We shall assume that a\nfree libration amplitude or free precession amplitude of 0.1 arcmin is detectable.\nGenerally, an impactor, which can be either a comet or asteroid, will strike at a point\nwith spherical coordinates R, \u03b8, \u03c6 relative to the body principal axis system with velocity\nrelative to the center of mass of Mercury of V~ = VR eR +V\u03b8 e\u03b8 +V\u03c6 e\u03c6 . The angular momentum\nof the impactor relative to the center of mass of Mercury is given by\n~I = R\n~ \u00d7 MV~ = MR(V\u03b8 e\u03c6 \u2212 V\u03c6 e\u03b8 ),\nL\n\n(51)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the impactor. With e\u03c6 = \u2212 sin \u03c6 ex +cos \u03c6 ey and e\u03b8 = cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 ex +\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03c6ey \u2212 sin \u03b8 ez , we can write\n~ I = MR[(\u2212V\u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u2212 V\u03c6 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)ex\nL\n+(V\u03b8 cos \u03c6 \u2212 V\u03c6 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6)ey\n\n+V\u03c6 sin \u03b8 ez ],\n\n(52)\n\n~M = L\n~ I , the components of L\n~M =\nWith the increment in Mercury's angular momentum, \u2206L\n~ 0 +\u2206L\n~ M along ex and ey indicates that a free wobble has been induced. But that is not all,\nL\nM\nsince the redistribution of mass due to the crater and its ejecta redefines the inertia tensor,\nso x, y, z are no longer the principal axes. The new axis of maximum moment being offset\nfrom the original z axis also contributes to the wobble. The component \u2206Lz means \u03c8\u0307m has\n~ M to the\nbeen incremented thereby creating a free libration in longitude. Transforming L\ninertial system defines a new direction of the total spin angular momentum which no longer\ncoincides with the Cassini state, which has itself been changed because of the change in the\n~ M now precesses around the new position of the Cassini state. A random\ninertia tensor. L\nimpact thus excites all three free motions (see Peale, 1975 for a more detailed treatment),\nbut how large must the impact be for detectable amplitudes?\nFirst we note that\nLIk = MRV\u03c6 sin \u03b8\n\nLI\u22a5 = MR(V\u03b82 + V\u03c62 cos2 \u03b8)1/2\n\n(53)\n\nare the components of impactor angular momentum just before impact at coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nthat are parallel and perpendicular to the spin axis. We consider first the excitation of\na free libration, which involves only LIk . The free libration is characterized by Eq. (43),\nwhere we neglect the right hand side\np to yield a small amplitude pendulum equation, whose\nfrequency of oscillation is xn = n 3(B \u2212 A)G201 (e)/Cm . Recall that \u03b3m = \u03c8m \u2212 1.5M is\nthe angular deviation of the x axis from the position it would have had if Mercury were\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n0\nrotating uniformly at angular velocity 1.5n. If \u03b3m = 0 and \u03b3\u0307m = \u03b3\u0307m\nat t = 0, the amplitude\nof the libration is\nLIk\nmax\n0\n\u03b3m\n= \u03b3\u0307m\n/\u03c90 =\n,\n(54)\nCm xn\nwhere the final form assumes that all of the libration amplitude is induced by the impact.\nmax\nIf we set \u03b3m\n= 0.1\u2032 = 2.91 \u00d7 10\u22125 rad as the minimum observable, choose V\u03c6 =\n60 km/sec as a common impact velocity, set Cm = 0.18MM R2 as before, choose (B\u2212A)/Cm =\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 so that xn = 0.026n, and maximize the effect of the collision for a given M by\nassuming \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, we find the necessary M = 1.51 \u00d7 1015 g. For a density of 1 g/cm3 , the\nradius of the impactor is 0.712 km.\n\nHolsapple (1993) has described a careful development of scaling laws that predict the\nproperties of impact craters from the size and velocity of the impactor and the strength\nand gravitational acceleration of the body on which the impact occurs. His Eq. (22b) gives\nthe rim radius for large craters where gravity dominates the strength of the materials in\ncontrolling the outcome of the crater formation.\nRr = 10.14G\u2032 \u22120.17 a\u2032 0.83 U 0.34 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere Rr is the rim radius of the crater just after it is formed in meters, G\u2032 is the ratio\nof the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the body to that of the Earth, a\u2032 is the\nradius of the impactor in meters, and U is the velocity in km/sec. Eq. (55) ignores the\nratio of the impactor density and surface material density raised to a small fractional power.\nWith Mercury's gravitational acceleration of 363 cm/sec compared to Earth's 980 cm/sec,\na\u2032 = 712 m and U = V\u03c6 = 60 km/sec, we find Rr =11.3 km. For a crater this large, it gets\neven larger because of slumping of the walls, with the expression for the final crater size in\nterms of Rr given by Eq. (28a) of Holsapple (1993). This is called a transition from a simple\nbowl-shaped crater to a complex crater with a shallow floor and central peak.\n\u0012 \u00130.079\nRf\nRf\n= 1.02\n,\n(56)\nRr\nR\u2217\nwhere Rf is the final rim radius, and R\u2217 is the transition radius from simple to complex\ncraters. R\u2217 is a function of the surface gravity with R\u2217 = 5 km for Mercury (Pike, 1988) (9.5\nkm for the Moon and 1.5 km for Earth and Venus). Substitution of this value of R\u2217 into\nEq. (56) yields 12.4 km as the rim radius expected for the impact event leading to a 0.1\u2032\nfree libration amplitude for Mercury. This is a minimum value because of the choice of the\nextreme optimum values of V\u03c6 and sin \u03b8 in Eq. (54). It should be noted that the Holsapple\ncrater radii are for vertical impacts, whereas we have calculated the angular momentum\nimpulse for an almost grazing impact. However, this caveat does not change the conclusion\nthat even the least detectable amplitude of a free libration of 0.1\u2032 excited by an impact would\nleave a more than 20 km diameter pristine scar on the surface of Mercury.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nFor an impact excitation of the precession, the angular amplitude would be\n\u2206i =\n\nLI\u22a5\nMV\u03b8 R\n=\n,\nCm \u03c8\u0307m\nCm \u03c8\u0307m\n\n(57)\n\nwhere we have assumed the impact is along a meridian for simplicity. If \u2206i = 0.1\u2032 , V\u03b8 =\n60 km/sec, and Cm = 0.18MM R2 , then M = 8.72 \u00d7 1016 g. The impactor radius is then\na\u2032 = 2.75 km for a density of 1 g/cm3 . It takes a much more energetic impact to excite an\nobservable free precession than an observable free libration. These numbers, when substituted into Eqs. (55) and (56), yield Rf = 41.7 km, and the pristine crater left behind from an\nimpact causing a 0.1\u2032 increment in the amplitude of the free precession would be more than\n80 km in diameter. The fact that the Cassini state itself has shifted slightly because of the\nredefinition of the inertia tensor would not change the free precession amplitude sufficiently\nto alter this conclusion.\nIn Table 1 of Levison and Duncan (1997), the rate of impact of Jupiter family comets\non Mercury is given as 8.6 \u00d7 10\u221210 comets/year. These are for comets of absolute magnitude\n< 9, which correspond to radii a\u2032 >\n\u223c 1 km (H. Levison, private communication 2005). The\ncollision rate of very long period comets is probably small compared to this rate for the\nJupiter family comets. (H. Levison, private communication 2005). More than a billion\nyears would elapse on average between impacts on Mercury of sufficient size to excite a 0.1\u2032\namplitude of the free libration in longitude, and because the larger impactor required, even\nmore time between excitations of a 0.1\u2032 amplitude of the free precession. Comparing this\ntime between excitations with the O(105 ) year damping times for the libration and precession\namplitudes means collisions almost certainly could not be the cause of any observable free\nlibration or free precession.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe spin orbit resonance of Mercury leads to a 30% reduction of the period of precession\nof the spin about the Cassini state from a contribution of the C22 term, compared to the\nusually derived precession period depending on J2 alone. This effect also leads to an elliptical\nprecessional path of the spin, where the ratio of the axes of the ellipse is about 1.0075.\nThere is a slight variation in the precession rate about the elliptical path with the maximum\noccurring when the separation of the spin from the Cassini state is minimal.\nThe simultaneous effects of tidal dissipation and a viscous liquid core-solid mantle coupling lead to time scales for damping Mercury's free libration in longitude and free precession\nof the spin about Cassini state 1 that are near 105 years. Because Mercury's liquid core is so\nlarge, the time scale for damping the precession amplitude by the core-mantle coupling acting\nalone is a factor of about 25 smaller than the time scale due to the tides alone for plausible\nchoices of the parameters. For the libration damping, the core-mantle time scale is a factor\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nof about 10 smaller than that for tidal friction. For all reasonable choices of the parameters,\nthe time scales are short compared with the age of the solar system. So if a free libration\nor free precession amplitude is found by the radar experiments or by the observations of\nthe MESSENGER or BepiColombo spacecraft, still unspecified recent or ongoing excitation\nmechanisms must be sought. It is possible that there exist observable forced deviations of\nthe spin axis from the Cassini state. If the forcing terms are identified, the amplitudes and\nphases of such deviations should be known and should not hinder the identification of the\nCassini state obliquity. On the other hand, the forcing terms are likely to be of fairly long\nperiod, as is likely if the amplitudes of the deviations from the Cassini state are observable.\nAs such their identity may not be obvious and the Cassini state position could be thereby\nuncertain until careful numerical integrations mapped such forced motions.\nAn observable libration amplitude (assumed to be 0.1\u2032 ) is much easier to generate by\nimpact than an observable precession. But such impact excitation of either motion is very\nunlikely, since there is an estimated average time span between impacts of sufficient size of\nabout 109 years with current cometary fluxes. Excitation by impact no more than a few\ndamping time scales in the past would leave a fresh crater larger than 20 km diameter for\nthe excitation of an observable amplitude of libration and larger than 80 km diameter for the\nexcitation of an observable precession amplitude. An observable free precession will make\nthe obliquity of the Cassini state, and thereby the determination of C/MM R2 uncertain.\nBut an observable free libration does not hamper the determination of the physical libration\namplitude. If Mercury's core were solid, the term with the kinematic viscosity would vanish\nin the expressions for the damping times of the precession and libration (Eqs. (40) and (50).\nBut the resulting damping times due to the tides alone would be longer that these equations\nwould indicate for \u03bd = 0, because the constants would then involve the moment of inertia of\nthe entire planet instead of just that of the mantle.\nThis analysis applies to other bodies in spin-orbit resonances such as the Moon, the\nregular satellites of the major planets, and Pluto's satellite Charon. The terms selected\nfrom the expansion of the torque expressions by the averaging process would correspond\nto rotation synchronous with the the orbital mean motions instead of 1.5 times the mean\nmotion used here. There are similar contributions to the rate of precession about the Cassini\nstate from C22 , since the synchronous rotation ensures terms involving C22 do not average\nto zero and C22 will be comparable to J2 in magnitude. There are indications that some\nof these bodies even have liquid layers in their interiors (e.g., Spohn and Schubert, 2003),\nalthough Europa would be a special case with a liquid ocean (e.g. Greenberg, 2004)\nIt will be more fun to seek alternative dynamic mechanisms of excitation of observed free\nmotions of Mercury than if no such motions are found. A possible albeit unlikely excitation\nof libration may lie in a coupling between the torques on the permanent deformation as\naffected by the spin-orbit resonance and the small obliquity of the Cassini state. Although\nsuch a libration would not be \"free,\" a near resonant forcing frequency could mimic a free\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nlibration. The investigation of such speculation is a future objective.\n\n6.\n\nAppendix A: Numerical Integration of the Precession Damping\n\nWe want to integrate Eqs. (5) over the precession time scale without following high\nfrequency motions on the orbit or libration time scales. The averaged torque on the perma~ i is given in Eq. (9), where we set \u03c8m = \u03c80 + 1.5M with \u03c80 = \u2212\u03a9 to\nnent deformation hN\naccommodate the conditions of the spin-orbit resonance in the averaging process. The last\nterm of Eq. (9) is of order i2 smaller than the next smallest term, and it is neglected in Eq.\n(13) written in terms of the components of the unit vector along the spin axis m\u0302. It is this\nlatter form of the averaged torque on the permanent deformation that we will use here.\nThe averaged tidal torque is given by Eq. (21). The component of hT~ i parallel to the\nspin axis is balanced by a slight offset of the axis of minimum moment of inertia from the\n~\ndirection to the Sun at perihelion. However, we have removed that degree of freedom in hNi\nby assigning \u03c80 = \u2212\u03a9 after Eq. (9). In order to avoid a secular change in \u03c8\u0307m , we keep\nonly the component of hT~ i perpendicular both to the spin vector and to the line of nodes.\nThe unit vector in this direction is e\u22a5 defined in Eq. (25). From this last equation, we see\nthat this is the only component of hT~ i that affects the obliquity. With \u03c80 = \u2212\u03a9 and the\nelimination of the tidal acceleration of the spin, we have eliminated integration over the free\nlibration period leaving only the precession time scale in the calculation. So in place of hT~ i,\nwe shall use\n\"\n#\nhT~ i * e\u22a5\n\u03c8\u0307m cos i\ne\u22a5 = K4 sin i nf1 (e) \u2212\n(f2 (e) \u2212 f3 (e) cos 2\u03a9) \u00d7\n2\nCm \u03c8\u0307m\n(\u2212 cos i sin \u03a9 eX + cos i cos \u03a9 eY + sin i eZ )\n\n(58)\n\nwhere K4 is defined by Eq. (28) with 1/(nQ0 ) replacing \u2206t as described in Section 2.2.\nInclusion of the f3 (e) part of the bracketed coefficient in Eq. (58) leads to a sin i in the\ndenominator, which complicates the calculation.

In this figure there is\na local minimum in \u03b3\u0307m at perihelion and two local maxima at equal times before and after\nperihelion. The angular acceleration is zero at these extremes and corresponds to the axis of\nminimum moment of inertia (long axis) of Mercury being aligned with the direction to the\nSun. We ignore the slight variation in rotation due to the physical librations in determining\nthe torque on Mercury by assuming it is rotating uniformly with \u03c8\u0307m = 1.5n. At perihelion,\nthe long axis is also pointing toward the Sun, but f \u0307 > \u03c8\u0307m = 1.5n at this point in the orbit.\nThe long axis does not keep up with the motion of the Sun in Mercury's sky as Mercury\npasses perihelion, so it starts to point away from the Sun in the direction of the orbital\nmotion. The angle between the Sun and the long axis continues to grow and reaches a local\nmaximum when f \u0307 = \u03c8\u0307m , which occurs when f = 25.743\u25e6 and M = 16.777\u25e6 , 4.101 days after\nperihelion passage. The torque on Mercury during this time tends to increase the angular\nvelocity corresponding to the positive slope on d\u03b3\u0307m /dt in Fig. 5 just after perihelion passage.\nThe increasing slope has an inflection at and starts to decrease after the time when f \u0307 = \u03c8\u0307m ,\nwhich is when the angle between the long axis and the Sun starts to decrease. The slope\nof the d\u03c8m /dt = d\u03b3m /dt curve reaches zero when the axes are again aligned. To bring the\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nlong axis back into alignment with the Sun after perihelion passage, Mercury must rotate\nthrough the same angle as it has moved in its orbit, so that f = 1.5M at the time of the\nfirst post perihelion alignment. This corresponds to f = 44.442\u25e6, M = 29.628\u25e6 at 7.242 days\nafter perihelion passage. After this time, the long axis points on the other side of the Sun\nand the angular velocity starts to decrease.\nThe motion is symmetric with respect to the perihelion passage so the numbers corresponding to the approach to perihelion are the negatives of those above. It is ascertained\nthat Mercury is almost synchronously rotating with its instantaneous orbital motion near\nthe perihelion, during which time the long axis never deviates much from pointing toward\nthe Sun. Hence, \u03b3\u0307m is almost constant for a time near the perihelion as shown in Fig. 5,\nwith the small deviations from a constant value explained above.\n\n8.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThanks are due H.
