We extend knot contact homology to a theory over the ring\nZ[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], with the invariant given topologically and combinatorially.\nThe improved invariant, which is defined for framed knots in S 3 and can\nbe generalized to knots in arbitrary manifolds, distinguishes the unknot\nand can distinguish mutants. It contains the Alexander polynomial and\nnaturally produces a two-variable polynomial knot invariant which is\nrelated to the A-polynomial.\n\n1. Introduction\nThis may be viewed as the third in a series of papers on knot contact\nhomology, following [15, 16]. In this paper, we extend the knot invariants\nof [15, 16], which were defined over the base ring Z, to invariants over the\nlarger ring Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ]. The new invariants, defined both for knots in S 3\nor R3 and for more general knots, contain a large amount of information\nnot contained in the original formulation of knot contact homology, which\ncorresponds to specifying \u03bb = \u03bc = 1. We will recapitulate definitions from\nthe previous papers where necessary, so that the results from this paper can\nhopefully be understood independently of [15, 16], although some proofs rely\nheavily on the previous papers.\nThe motivation for the invariant given by knot contact homology comes\nfrom symplectic geometry and in particular the Symplectic Field Theory of\nEliashberg, Givental, and Hofer [8]. Our approach in this paper and its predecessors is to view the invariant topologically and combinatorially, without\nusing the language of symplectic topology. Work is currently in progress to\nshow that the invariant defined here does actually give the \"Legendrian contact homology\" of a certain canonically defined object. For more details, see\n[15, \u00a73] or the end of this section, where we place the current work in context\nwithin the general subject of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.\nWe introduce the invariant in Section 2. For a knot in R3 , the form for the\ninvariant which carries the most information is a differential graded algebra\nover Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], which we call the framed knot DGA, modulo an equivalence\nrelation known in contact geometry as stable tame isomorphism, which is a\nspecial case of quasi-isomorphism. We can define this algebra in terms of a\nbraid whose closure is the desired knot; this is the version of the invariant\nwhich is directly derived from considerations in contact geometry. There is\na slightly more natural definition for the framed knot DGA in terms of a\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL. NG\n\ndiagram of the knot, but a satisfying topological interpretation for the full\ninvariant has yet to be discovered.\nWe refer to the homology of the framed knot DGA, which is also a knot\ninvariant, as framed knot contact homology. The most tractable piece of\ninformation which can be extracted from the framed knot DGA is the degree\n0 piece of this homology, which we call the cord algebra of the knot because it\naffords a natural topological reformulation in terms of cords, in the spirit of\n[16]. The cord algebra can easily be extended to knots in arbitrary manifolds\nusing homotopy groups, specifically the peripheral information attached to\nthe knot group. It seems likely that this general cord algebra measures\nthe degree 0 part of the corresponding Legendrian contact homology, as for\nknots in S 3 , but a proof would need to expand our current technology for\ncalculating contact homology.\nThe framed knot DGA contains a fair amount of \"classical\" information\nabout the knot. In particular, one can deduce the Alexander polynomial\nfrom a certain canonical linearization of the algebra. More interestingly, one\ncan use the framed knot DGA, or indeed the cord algebra derived from it, to\ndefine a two-variable polynomial knot invariant which we call the augmentation polynomial. The augmentation polynomial, in turn, has a factor which\nis the well-studied A-polynomial introduced in [2]. In particular, a result of\nDunfield and Garoufalidis [3] about the nontriviality of the A-polynomial\nimplies that the cord algebra (and hence framed knot contact homology)\ndistinguishes the unknot from all other knots. There is a close relationship\nbetween knot contact homology and SL2 C representations of the knot complement, as evidenced by the link to the A-polynomial, but there does not\nseem to be an interpretation for the framed knot DGA purely in terms of\ncharacter varieties.\nOn a related topic, the cord algebra is a reasonably effective tool to distinguish knots. Certainly it can tell apart knots which have different Alexander\npolynomials, and it can also distinguish mirrors (e.g., left handed and right\nhanded trefoils). It can even distinguish knots which have the same Apolynomial, such as the Kinoshita\u2013Terasaka knot and its Conway mutant.\nThe tool used to produce such results is a collection of numerical invariants\nderived from the cord algebra, called augmentation numbers, which can be\nreadily calculated by computer. It is even remotely possible that the cord\nalgebra could be a complete knot invariant.\nHere is an outline of the paper. Section 2 contains the various definitions\nof the knot invariant, and the nontrivial portions of the proofs of their invariance and equivalence are given in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss\nproperties of the invariant, including the aforementioned relation with the\nAlexander polynomial. Section 5 examines some information which can be\nextracted from the invariant, including augmentation numbers and the augmentation polynomial, and discusses the relation with the A-polynomial.\nSection 6 outlines extensions of the invariant to various other contexts, including spatial graphs and higher-dimensional knots.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n3\n\nWe conclude this section with some remarks about the contact geometry\nof the framed knot DGA. As discussed in [15], the knot DGA of a knot\nin R3 measures the Legendrian contact homology of a naturally defined\nLegendrian torus (the unit conormal to the knot) in the contact manifold\nST \u2217 R3 . In its most general form (see [9]), Legendrian contact homology is\ndefined over the group ring of the first homology group of the Legendrian\nsubmanifold: briefly, the group ring coefficients arise from considering the\nboundaries of the holomorphic disks used in Legendrian contact homology,\nwhich lie in the Legendrian submanifold and can be closed to closed curves\nby adding capping paths joining endpoints of Reeb chords.\nIn our case, the Legendrian torus is essentially the boundary of a tubular\nneighborhood of the knot, and the group ring ZH1 (T 2 ) can be identified\nwith Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] once we choose a framing for the knot. The resulting\nDGA, whose homology is the Legendrian contact homology of the Legendrian torus, is precisely the framed knot DGA defined above; this result is\nthe focus of an upcoming paper of Ekholm, Etnyre, Sullivan, and the author.\nSince its introduction by Eliashberg and Hofer [7], Legendrian contact\nhomology has been studied in many papers, including [1, 4, 9, 14]. Much\nof this work has focused on the lowest dimensional case, that of Legendrian\nknots in standard contact R3 (or other contact three-manifolds). The present\nmanuscript, along with its predecessors [15, 16], comprises one of the first\ninstances of a reasonably nontrivial and involved computation of Legendrian\ncontact homology in higher dimensions; see also [5]. (This statement tacitly\nassumes the pending result, mentioned above, that the combinatorial version\nof knot contact homology presented here agrees with the geometric version\nfrom contact topology.)\nBeyond its implications for knot theory, the Legendrian contact homology\nin this case is interesting because it has several features not previously observed in the subject. In particular, the use of group ring coefficients in our\nsetting is crucial for applications, whereas the author currently knows of no\napplications of group ring coefficients for, say, the theory of one-dimensional\nLegendrian knots.\nAcknowledgments.

The first, in terms of\nhomotopy groups, generalizes the version of the cord ring given in the appendix to [16]. The second, in terms of cords, generalizes the original definition\nof the cord ring in [16]. The third, in terms of a braid representation of the\nknot, and the fourth, in terms of a knot diagram, extend the definition of\nknot contact homology and the knot DGA from [15].\n\n\f4\n\nL. NG\n\nThroughout this section, we work with noncommutative algebras, but for\nthe purposes of our applications, one could just as well abelianize and work in\nthe commutative category. (Note that for the full DGA, abelianizing forces\nus to work over a ring containing Q [9].) This is in contrast to the situation\nof Legendrian knots in R3 , where it is sometimes advantageous to exploit\nnoncommutativity [14]. It is possible that one could use the noncommutative\nstructure for the cord algebra or framed knot DGA to distinguish a knot\nfrom its inverse; see Section 4.1.\n2.1. Homotopy interpretation. This version of the invariant has the advantage of being defined in the most general setup.\nLet K \u2282 M be a connected codimension 2 submanifold of any smooth\nmanifold, equipped with an orientation of the normal bundle to K in M .\nDenote by \u03bd(K) a tubular neighborhood of K in M , and choose a point x0 on\nthe boundary \u2202(\u03bd(K)). The orientation of the normal bundle determines an\nelement m \u2208 \u03c01 (\u2202\u03bdK, x0 ) given by the oriented fiber of the S 1 bundle \u2202\u03bdK\nover K. The inclusion \u03b9 : \u2202\u03bdK \u0592\u2192 M \\ K induces a map \u03b9\u2217 : \u03c01 (\u2202\u03bdK, x0 ) \u2192\n\u03c01 (M \\ K, x0 ).\nDenote by R = ZH1 (\u2202\u03bdK) the group ring of the homology group H1 (\u2202\u03bdK),\nwith coefficients in Z; the usual abelianization map from \u03c01 to H1 yields\na map p : \u03c01 (\u2202\u03bdK, x0 ) \u2192 R. Let A denote the tensor algebra over R\nfreely generated by the elements of the group \u03c01 (M \\ K, x0 ), where we view\n\u03c01 (M \\ K, x0 ) as a set. We write the image of \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (M \\ K, x0 ) in A as\n[\u03b3]; then A is generated as an R-module by words of the form [\u03b31 ] * * * [\u03b3k ],\nk \u2265 0. (Note that [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] 6= [\u03b31 ][\u03b32 ] in A.)\nDefinition 2.1. Let I \u2282 A be the subalgebra generated by the following\nelements of A:\n(1) [e] \u2212 1 \u2212 p(m), where e is the identity in \u03c01 (M \\ K) and 1 is the unit\nin A;\n(2) [\u03b3\u03b9\u2217 (\u03b3 \u2032 )] \u2212 p(\u03b3 \u2032 )[\u03b3] and [\u03b9\u2217 (\u03b3 \u2032 )\u03b3] \u2212 p(\u03b3 \u2032 )[\u03b3], for any \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 \u03c01 (\u2202\u03bdK) and\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (M \\ K);\n(3) [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] + [\u03b31 \u03b9\u2217 (m)\u03b32 ] \u2212 [\u03b31 ] * [\u03b32 ], for any \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u03c01 (M \\ K).\nThe cord algebra of K \u2282 M is the algebra A/I, over the ring R.\nThis algebra, modulo isomorphism fixing the base ring R, is evidently an\nisotopy invariant of K. We note that the relation [e] = 1 + p(m) in A/I is\nchosen to give consistency between the other two relations; the third relation\ngives\n[\u03b31 ][e] = [\u03b31 e] + [\u03b31 \u03b9\u2217 (m)e] = [\u03b31 ] + [\u03b31 \u03b9\u2217 (m)]\nfor \u03b31 \u2208 \u03c01 (M \\ K), while the second relation gives [\u03b31 ] + [\u03b31 \u03b9\u2217 (m)] =\n(1 + p(m))[\u03b31 ].\nIn our case of interest, K is an oriented knot in M = S 3 (or R3 ), \u2202\u03bdK\nis topologically a 2-torus, and H1 (\u2202\u03bdK) = Z2 . A framing of K gives a set\n{\u03bb, \u03bc} of generators of H1 (\u2202\u03bdK), where \u03bb is the longitude of K and \u03bc is the\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n5\n\nmeridian. Given a framing, we can hence identify R = ZH1 (\u2202\u03bdK) with the\nring Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ].\nDefinition 2.2. Let K \u2282 S 3 be a framed knot, and let l, m denote the homotopy classes of the longitude and meridian of K in \u03c01 (S 3 \\K). The framed\ncord algebra of K is the tensor algebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] freely generated by\n\u03c01 (S 3 \\ K), modulo the relations\n(1) [e] = 1 + \u03bc;\n(2) [\u03b3m] = [m\u03b3] = \u03bc[\u03b3] and [\u03b3l] = [l\u03b3] = \u03bb[\u03b3], for \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K);\n(3) [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] + [\u03b31 m\u03b32 ] = [\u03b31 ][\u03b32 ], for \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K).\nIt is clear that, for framed knots, this definition agrees with Definition 2.1\nabove.\nA few remarks are in order. First, the condition [\u03b3m] = [m\u03b3] = \u03bc[\u03b3] in\n(2) of Definition 2.2 is actually unnecessary since it follows from (1) and (3)\nwith (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ) = (\u03b3, e) or (e, \u03b3).\nSecond, changing the framing of the knot by k \u2208 Z has the effect of\nreplacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u03bck in the cord algebra. If we change K to the mirror of K,\nwith the corresponding framing, then the cord algebra changes by replacing\n\u03bc by \u03bc\u22121 ; if we reverse the orientation of K, then the cord algebra changes\nby replacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u22121 and \u03bc by \u03bc\u22121 .\nFinally, as an illustration of Definition 2.2, we compute the framed cord\nalgebra for the 0-framed unknot in S 3 . Here \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) \u223c\n= Z is generated by\nthe meridian m, and the relations in Definition 2.2 imply that [e] = 1 + \u03bc,\n[m] = \u03bc[e], and [e] = \u03bb[e], and so the framed cord algebra is\nZ[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ]/((\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1)).\n2.2. Cord interpretation. The homotopy definition of the cord algebra\ngiven above is perhaps not the most useful formulation from a computational\nstandpoint. Here we give another topological definition of the cord algebra,\nin terms of the paths which we termed \"cords\" in [16].\nDefinition 2.3. Let K \u2282 S 3 be an oriented knot, and let \u2217 be a fixed\npoint on K. A cord of (K, \u2217) is any continuous path \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 S 3 with\n\u03b3 \u22121 (K) = {0, 1} and \u03b3 \u22121 ({\u2217}) = \u2205. Let AK denote the tensor algebra\nover Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] freely generated by the set of homotopy classes of cords of\n(K, \u2217).\nNote that this definition differs slightly from the definition of cords in\n[16]. As in [16], we distinguish between a knot and its cords in diagrams by\ndrawing the knot more thickly.\nIn AK , we define skein relations as follows:\n(1)\n\n= 1 + \u03bc;\n\n\f6\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nL. NG\n\n*\n\n=\u03bb\n\n*\n+\u03bc\n\nand\n\n=\n\n*\n*\n\n=\u03bb\n\n*\n\n;\n\n.\n\nThese diagrams are understood to depict some neighborhood in S 3 outside\nof which the diagrams agree. To clarify the diagrams, if one pushes either\nof the cords on the left hand side of (3) to intersect the knot, then the cord\nsplits into the two cords on the right hand side of (3); also, the cord in\n(1) is any contractible cord. Note that the skein relations are considered as\ndiagrams in space rather than in the plane. For example, (3) is equivalent\nto\n+\u03bc\n\n=\n\n*\n\n,\n\neven though the two relations are not the same when interpreted as plane\ndiagrams.\nDefinition 2.4. The cord algebra of (K, \u2217) is AK modulo the relations (1),\n(2), and (3).\nNote that the definition of the cord algebra of (K, \u2217), if we set \u03bb = \u03bc = 1,\nis the same as the definition of the cord ring of K from [16], after we change\nvariables by replacing every cord by \u22121 times itself.\nProposition 2.5. The cord algebra of (K, \u2217) is independent, up to isomorphism, of the choice of the point \u2217, and is isomorphic to the framed cord\nalgebra of Definition 2.2 when K \u2282 S 3 is given the 0 framing.\nProof. To see the isomorphism between the algebras specified by Definitions 2.2 and 2.4, connect the base point x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03bdK from the homotopy\ninterpretation to a nearby point x \u2208 K (with x 6= \u2217) via some path. By\nconjugating by this path, we can associate, to any loop \u03b3 representing an\nelement of \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K, x0 ), a cord \u03b3\u0303 beginning and ending at x, and homotopic loops are mapped to homotopic cords. The map from the framed cord\nalgebra with framing 0 to the cord algebra of Definition 2.4 sends [\u03b3] to\n\u03bclk(\u03b3,K) [\u03b3\u0303], where lk is the linking number. It is easily verified that this\nmap is an isomorphism. Note that the 0 framing is necessary so that a\ncord following the longitude of K is identified with \u03bb times the contractible\ncord.\n\u0003\nIt follows readily from Definition 2.4 that the cord algebra of a knot K is\nfinitely generated and finitely presented. Any cord, in fact, can be expressed\nin terms of the so-called minimal binormal chords of the knot, which are the\nlocal length minimizers among the line segments beginning and ending on\nthe knot (imagine a general cord as a rubber band and pull it tight). For a\ndescription of how we can calculate the cord algebra from a diagram of the\nknot, see Section 2.4.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n7\n\n2.3. Differential graded algebra interpretation I. This version of the\ninvariant is the original one, derived from holomorphic curve theory and\ncontact homology. The invariant we define here is actually \"better\" than\nthe cord algebra defined above; it is a differential graded algebra whose\nhomology in degree 0 is the cord algebra. It is an open question to develop\na topological interpretation for the full differential graded algebra, using\ncords or homotopy groups as in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.\nWe recall some definitions from [15], slightly modified for our purposes.\nLet Bn be the braid group on n strands, and let An denote the tensor\nalgebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] freely generated by the n(n \u2212 1) generators aij ,\nwith 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i 6= j.

There is a similar representation \u03c6ext : Bn \u2192 Aut An+1 given by the composition of the inclusion\nBn \u0592\u2192 Bn+1 with the map \u03c6 on Bn+1 , where the inclusion adds a strand\nwe label \u2217 to the n-strand braid. For B \u2208 Bn , we can then define n \u00d7 n\nR\nmatrices \u03a6L\nB , \u03a6B with coefficients in An by the defining relations\n\u03c6ext\nB (ai\u2217 )\n\nn\nX\n(\u03a6L\n=\nB )ij aj\u2217\nj=1\n\nand\n\n\u03c6ext\nB (a\u2217j )\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\na\u2217i (\u03a6R\nB )ij .\n\ni=1\n\nFix a braid B \u2208 Bn . Let A be the graded tensor algebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ]\ngenerated by: aij , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i 6= j, of degree 0; bij and cij , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n,\nof degree 1; and dij , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and ei , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, of degree 2. (Note that\nA contains An as a subalgebra.) Assemble the a, b, c, d generators of A into\nn \u00d7 n matrices as follows: B = (bij ), C = (cij ), D = (dij ), and A = (a\u2032ij ),\nwhere\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\ni<j\n\uf8f2\u03bcaij ,\n\u2032\naij = aij ,\ni>j\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u22121 \u2212 \u03bc, i = j.\n\n(The matrix B is only tangentially related to the braid B; the distinction\nshould be clear from context.)

Define\na differential \u2202 on the generators of A by\n\u2202A = 0\n\u2202B = (1 \u2212 \u039b * \u03a6L\nB) * A\n\u22121\n\u2202C = A * (1 \u2212 \u03a6R\nB *\u039b )\n\u22121\nL\n\u2202D = B * (1 \u2212 \u03a6R\nB * \u039b ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u039b * \u03a6B ) * C\n\n\u2202ei = (B + \u039b * \u03a6L\nB * C)ii ,\nwhere * denotes matrix multiplication, and extend \u2202 to A via linearity over\nZ[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] and the (signed) Leibniz rule. Then (A, \u2202) is the framed knot\nDGA of B.\nHere \"DGA\" is the abbreviation commonly used in the subject for a\n(semifree) differential graded algebra. We remark that if we set \u03bb = \u03bc = 1,\nwe recover the definition of the knot DGA over Z from [15].\nThere is a standard notion of equivalence between DGAs known as stable\ntame isomorphism, originally due to Chekanov [1]; we now briefly review its\ndefinition, in the version which we need. Note that an important property\nof stable tame isomorphism is that it preserves homology (see [9]).\nSuppose that we have two DGAs (A, \u2202) and (A\u2032 , \u2202 \u2032 ), where A, A\u2032 are\ntensor algebras over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] generated by a1 , . . . , an and a\u20321 , . . . , a\u2032n , respectively. An algebra map \u03c8 : A \u2192 A\u2032 is an elementary isomorphism if it\nis a graded chain map and, for some i,\n\u03c8(ai ) = \u03b1a\u2032i + v\n\u03c8(aj ) = a\u2032j\n\nfor all j 6= i,\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a unit in Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] and v is in the subalgebra of A\u2032 generated\nby a\u20321 , . . . , a\u2032i\u22121 , a\u2032i+1 , . . . , a\u2032n . A tame isomorphism between DGAs is a composition of elementary isomorphisms. Let (E i , \u2202 i ) be the tensor algebra on\ntwo generators ei1 , ei2 , with deg ei1 \u2212 1 = deg ei2 = i and differential induced\nby \u2202 i ei1 = ei2 , \u2202 i ei2 = 0. The degree-i algebraic stabilization of a DGA (A, \u2202)\nis the coproduct of A with E i , with the differential induced from \u2202 and\n\u2202 i . Finally, two DGAs are stable tame isomorphic if they are tamely isomorphic after some (possibly trivial, possibly different) number of algebraic\nstabilizations of each.\nWe can now state the invariance result for framed knot DGAs. For any\nbraid B \u2208 Bn , define the writhe w(B), as usual, to be the sum of the\nexponents of the word in \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 comprising B.\nTheorem 2.7. If braids B and B \u2032 have isotopic knot closures, then the\nframed knot DGA for B \u2032 is stable tame isomorphic to the DGA obtained by\n\u2032\nreplacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u03bcw(B )\u2212w(B) in the framed knot DGA for B.\nWe defer the proof of Theorem 2.7 to Section 3.1.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n9\n\nDefinition 2.8. Let K \u2282 S 3 be a knot. The f -framed knot DGA of K is\nthe (stable tame isomorphism class of the) framed knot DGA of any braid\nB whose closure is K and which has writhe f . We will often refer to the\n0-framed knot DGA, which can be obtained from the f -framed knot DGA\nby replacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u03bcf , as the framed knot DGA.\nSince mirroring affects the framed knot DGA nontrivially, Definition 2.8 is\nnot completely clear until we specify what positive and negative braid crossings look like when the braid is embedded in R3 . We choose the convention\nthat a positive crossing in a braid (i.e., a generator \u03c3k ) is one in which\nthe strands rotate around each other counterclockwise. Thus the writhe\nof a braid is negative the writhe of the knot which is its closure; we will\nhenceforth only use the term \"writhe\" vis-\u00e0-vis braids.\nSince stable tame isomorphic DGAs have isomorphic homology, the homology of the framed knot DGA produces another framed knot invariant.\nDefinition 2.9. Let K be a framed knot in S 3 with framing f , or a knot\nwith framing 0 if no framing is specified. The framed knot contact homology\nof K, denoted HC\u2217 (K), is the graded homology of the framed knot DGA of\nK.\nNote that HC\u2217 (K) only exists in dimensions \u2217 \u2265 0. The following result\nconnects the invariant defined in this section to the invariants from the two\nprevious sections.\nTheorem 2.10. Let K \u2282 S 3 be a knot. Then the degree 0 framed knot contact homology HC0 (K), viewed as an algebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], is isomorphic\nto the cord algebra of K.\nWe will indicate a proof of Theorem 2.10 in Section 3.2.\nCorollary 2.11 (cf. [15, Prop. 4.2]). If B \u2208 Bn is a braid which has closure\nK, then the cord algebra of K is the result of replacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u03bc\u2212w(B) in\nAn /I, where I is the subalgebra generated by the entries of the matrices\nR\n\u22121\n(1 \u2212 \u039b * \u03a6L\nB ) * A and A * (1 \u2212 \u03a6B * \u039b ).\nPotentially the framed knot DGA of a knot contains much more information than the cord algebra. However, it seems difficult to compute HC\u2217\nfor \u2217 > 0, and it remains an open question whether stable tame isomorphism is a stronger relation than quasi-isomorphism (i.e., having isomorphic\nhomology).\nAs an example, we compute the cord algebra for the left handed trefoil,\nwhich is the closure of the braid \u03c313 \u2208 B2 . As calculated in [15], we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2a12 \u2212a12 a21 a12 \u22121+a12 a21\n2a21 \u2212a21 a12 a21 1\u2212a21 a12\nR\n,\n=\nand\n\u03a6\n=\n\u03a6L\n3\n3\n1\u2212a\na\na\n\u22121+a\na\na\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n21 12\n21\n12 21\n12\n1\n\n1\n\nand hence HC0 is A2 modulo the entries of the matrices\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22121\u2212\u03bc+\u03bb(1+2\u03bc)a21 \u2212\u03bb\u03bca21 a12 a21 \u03bb+\u03bb\u03bc+\u03bca12 \u2212\u03bb(1+3\u03bc)a21 a12 +\u03bb\u03bca21 a12 a21 a12\n)*A\n=\n(1\u2212\u039b*\u03a6L\n3\n\u03c3\n\u22121\u2212\u03bc+a21 +\u03bca12 a21\n\u22121\u2212\u03bc+(1+2\u03bc)a12 \u2212\u03bca12 a21 a12\n1\n\n\f10\n\nL.

Differential graded algebra interpretation II. The definition of\nthe framed knot DGA from Section 2.3 is somewhat formal and inscrutable.\nHere we give another formulation for the DGA, using a diagram of the knot\nrather than a braid presentation. This is based on the cord formulation for\nthe invariant, and improves on Section 4.4 of [16].\nWe first describe how to use a knot diagram to calculate the cord algebra.\nSuppose that we have a knot diagram of K with n crossings; see Figure 1.\nThe crossings divide the diagram of the knot into n connected components,\nwhich we label 1, . . . , n; also number the crossings 1, . . . , n in some way.\nCrossing \u03b1 can be represented as (o\u03b1 , l\u03b1 , r\u03b1 ), where o\u03b1 is the overcrossing\nstrand, and l\u03b1 and r\u03b1 are the left and right undercrossing strands from the\npoint of view of the orientation on o\u03b1 . Choose the point \u2217 of Definition 2.4\nto be the undercrossing point of crossing 1, and define \u01eb1 to be 1 if crossing\n1 is a positive crossing, and \u22121 if it is negative.\nLet An denote the tensor algebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] generated by aij , where\ndiagram\n\u2282 An\n1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and i 6= j, and set aii = 1+\u03bc for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.

Then the generators of IK\nare the entries of the\nmatrices\n\u03a8L * \u00c2,\n\n\u00c2 * \u03a8R .\n\nFor \u0012\nexample, for the\n\u0013 right handed\n\u0012 trefoil shown\u0013 in Figure 2, we have\n\u03bb\u03bc \u2212a13 1\n\u03bb\u22121\n\u03bc \u2212a23\n1\n\u03bc \u2212a21 .

Setting a12 = x, we can use the\nrelations to compute that the cord ring of the right hand trefoil is\n(Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ])[x]/(x2 \u2212 x \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc, x2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bcx \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc).\nThis agrees with the expression given in Section 2.3, after we change variables x \u2192 \u2212\u03bc\u22121 x.\nWe now construct a differential graded algebra whose degree 0 homology\nis the cord algebra. Similarly to Section 2.3, the algebra is the graded tensor\nalgebra over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] generated by: aij , 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 n, of degree 0; b\u03b1i\nand ci\u03b1 , 1 \u2264 \u03b1, i \u2264 n, of degree 1; and d\u03b1\u03b2 , 1 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 n, and e\u03b1 , 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 n,\n\n\f12\n\nL.

This defines a differential, and the resulting differential\ngraded algebra is stable tame isomorphic to the framed knot DGA.\nThe author's current proof of Proposition 2.13 is quite laborious, involving\nverification of invariance under Reidemeister moves and then identification\nwith the framed knot DGA for a particular knot diagram. Since we have no\napplications yet of Proposition 2.13, we omit its proof. We have nevertheless\nincluded this formulation of the framed knot DGA in hopes that it might\nshed light on the topology behind the DGA invariant.\nWe remark that, using the above expression for the cord algebra in terms\nof a knot diagram, we can write the cord algebra for a knot of bridge number\nk as a quotient of Ak . Express the knot as a 2k-plat, with k vertical tangents\nto the knot diagram on the left and k on the right, and label the k leftmost\nstrands of the diagram 1, . . . , k; then if we progressively construct the knot\nstarting with these k strands and moving from left to right, we can express\nany generator aij involving a strand not among 1, . . . , k in terms of the\ngenerators of Ak . More generally, we can use stable tame isomorphism to\nexpress the framed knot DGA as a DGA all of whose generators have indices\nless than or equal to k, although this is more difficult to establish.\n3. Equivalence and Invariance Proofs\nHere we prove the main theorems from Section 2, invariance of the framed\nknot DGA (Theorem 2.7) and equivalence of the cord algebra and HC0\n(Theorem 2.10). The proofs rely heavily on the corresponding proofs in\n[15, 16], and the casual reader will probably want to skip to the next section.\n3.1. Proof of Theorem 2.7. Theorem 2.7 is proven by following the proof\nof Theorem 2.10 in [15], which is the special case of Theorem 2.7 when\n\u03bb = \u03bc = 1, and making modifications where necessary. We will provide the\nproof at the end of this section.\nWe first need an auxiliary result, which will also be useful in Section 4.1.\nIn the definition of the framed knot DGA, we used a matrix \u039b = diag(\u03bb, 1, . . . , 1).\nWe could just as well have used a diagonal matrix where \u03bb is the m-th diagonal entry rather than the first. The result states that this does not change\nthe framed knot DGA, up to tame isomorphism. Note that the corresponding result for HC0 essentially amounts to the statement that the cord algebra\nof Definition 2.4 is independent of the base point \u2217.\nFor any vector v of length n, let \u2206(v) be the n \u00d7 n diagonal matrix whose\ndiagonal entries are the entries of v. If n is fixed, then for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, define\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n13\n\nvm to be the vector (1, . . . , 1, \u03bb, 1, . . . , 1) of length n with \u03bb as its m-th entry.\nWrite \u039bm = \u2206(vm ).\nProposition 3.1. For B \u2208 Bn , let (A, \u2202) be the framed knot DGA of B,\n \u0303 be the DGA obtained from the same\nas given in Definition 2.6. Let (\u00c3, \u2202)\ndefinition, but with \u039b replaced by \u039bm for some m \u2264 n. Then (A, \u2202) and\n \u0303 are tamely isomorphic.\n(\u00c3, \u2202)\nBefore we prove Proposition 3.1, we establish a simple lemma. Fix a braid\nB \u2208 Bn which closes to a knot. Let s(B) denote the image of B under the\nusual homomorphism s : Bn \u2192 Sn to the symmetric group; there is an\nobvious action of s(B) on vectors of length n, by permuting entries.\nR\nThe matrices \u03a6L\nB , \u03a6B have entries which are (noncommutative) polynoR\nmials in the aij variables; for clarity, we can denote them by \u03a6L\nB (A), \u03a6B (A),\nwhere A is the usual matrix of the aij 's. If \u00c3 denotes the same matrix\nR\nbut with each aij replaced by \u00e3ij , then we write \u03a6L\nB (\u00c3), \u03a6B (\u00c3) to be the\nR\nmatrices \u03a6L\nB (A), \u03a6B (A) with each aij replaced by \u00e3ij .\nLemma 3.2. Let v be a vector of length n, and define \u00e3ij by the matrix\nequation \u00c3 = \u2206(v) * A * \u2206(v)\u22121 ; that is, \u00e3ij = vvji aij . Then\nL\n\u22121\n\u03a6L\nB (\u00c3) = \u2206(s(B)v)*\u03a6B (A)*\u2206(v)\n\nand\n\nR\n\u22121\n\u03a6R\nB (\u00c3) = \u2206(v)*\u03a6B (A)*\u2206(s(B)v) .\n\nProof. The ij entry of \u03a6L\nB (A) is a linear combination of words of the form\nas(B)(i),i1 ai1 i2 * * * aik\u22121 ik aik j , while the ij entry of \u03a6L\nB (\u00c3) is the same linear\nvs(B)(i)\ncombination of words \u00e3s(B)(i),i1 \u00e3i1 i2 * * * \u00e3ik\u22121 ik \u00e3ik j = vj as(B)(i),i1 ai1 i2 * * * aik\u22121 ik aik j .\nHence the ij entry of \u03a6L\nB (\u00c3) is\n\nvs(B)(i)\nvj\n\ntimes the ij entry of \u03a6L\nB (A). The\n\nR\nresult follows for \u03a6L\nB ; an analogous computation yields the result for \u03a6B . \u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 3.1. Since the braid B closes to a knot, the permutation s(B) can be written as a cycle (1, m1 , . . . , mn\u22121 ). Define a vector vm\nof length n whose i-th entry is \u03bb if i appears after 1 but not after m in the\ncycle for s(B); for example, for B = \u03c31 \u03c33 \u03c32\u22123 \u2208 B4 , we have s(B) = (1243),\nand thus v2 = (1, \u03bb, 1, 1), v3 = (1, \u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb), v4 = (1, \u03bb, \u03bb, 1).\nTo distinguish between the algebras A and \u00c3, denote the generators of \u00c3\nby \u00e3ij , b\u0303ij , c\u0303ij , d \u0303ij , \u1ebdi ; the first four families can be assembled into matrices\n\u00c3, B\u0303, C\u0303, D\u0303. We claim that the identification \u00c3 = \u2206(vm ) * A * \u2206(vm )\u22121 ,\nB\u0303 = \u2206(vm )*B *\u2206(vm )\u22121 , C\u0303 = \u2206(vm )*C *\u2206(vm )\u22121 , D\u0303 = \u2206(vm )*D*\u2206(vm )\u22121 ,\n \u0303\ne \u0303i = ei also identifies \u2202 \u0303 with \u2202.\nIndeed, under this identification, we have\n\u2202 \u0303B\u0303 = \u00c3 \u2212 \u039bm * \u03a6L\nB (\u00c3) * \u00c3\n\u22121\n= \u2206(vm ) * A * \u2206(vm )\u22121 \u2212 \u039bm * \u2206(s(B)vm ) * \u03a6L\nB (A) * A * \u2206(vm )\n\u22121\n= \u2206(vm ) * (A \u2212 \u039b * \u03a6L\nB (A) * A) * \u2206(vm )\n\n= \u2202 B\u0303,\n\n\f14\n\nL. NG\n\nwhere the second equality follows from 3.2, and the third follows from the\nfact that \u039bm = \u2206(vm ) * \u039b * \u2206(s(B)vm ), by the construction of vm . We\nsimilarly find that \u2202 \u0303 = \u2202 on C\u0303, D\u0303, and \u1ebdi . Thus the identification gives\n \u0303 as\na (tame) isomorphism between A and \u00c3 which intertwines \u2202 and \u2202,\ndesired.\n\u0003\n\nSketch of proof of Theorem 2.7. The theorem can be proved in a way precisely following the proof of Theorem 2.10 in [15], making alterations where\nnecessary. It suffices to establish the theorem when B and B \u2032 are related\nby one of the Markov moves. We consider each in turn, giving the identification of generators which establishes the desired stable tame isomorphism,\nand leaving the easy but extremely tedious verifications to the reader.\nConjugation.

By Proposition 3.1, the\nmodified framed knot DGA for B\u0303 is tamely isomorphic to the same DGA\n \u0303 with generators\nbut with \u039b replaced by \u039b\u0303; call the latter DGA (\u00c3, \u2202),\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\u00e3ij , b\u0303ij , c\u0303ij , dij , \u1ebdi .

Proof of Theorem 2.10. This proof is essentially the proof of Theorem 1.3 from [16], with only slight modifications. Rather than giving the\nproof in full, we will outline the steps here and refer the reader to [16] for\ndetails.\nLet D be the unit disk in C, and choose points p1 , . . . , pn , q1 , . . . , qn in D\nsuch that p1 , . . . , pn lie on the real line with p1 < * * * < pn and qj = pj + \u01ebi\nfor each j and some small \u01eb > 0. We will depict the points p1 , . . . , pn by an\nopen circle, and q1 , . . . , qn by closed circles; see Figure 3.\nThe braid group Bn acts by homeomorphisms in the usual way on the\npunctured disk D \\ P , where P denotes {p1 , . . . , pn }. That is, \u03c3k rotates\npk , pk+1 in a counterclockwise fashion around each other until they change\nplaces. Furthermore, we can stipulate that the line segments pk qk and\npk+1 qk+1 remain vertical and of fixed length throughout the isotopy, so that\n\u03c3k also interchanges qk , qk+1 , and hence every element of Bn fixes the set\nQ = {q1 , . . . , qn }. Then Bn acts on the set of framed cords, as defined below.\nDefinition 3.3 (cf. [16, Def. 3.1]). A framed cord of (D, P, Q) is a continuous map \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 D \\ P such that \u03b3(0), \u03b3(1) \u2208 Q. The set of\nframed arcs modulo homotopy is denoted Pn . Define \u03b4i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and \u03b3ij ,\n1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 n, to be the framed cords depicted in Figure 3.\nProposition 3.4 (cf. [16, Props. 2.2, 3.2, 3.3]). With An as in Section 2.3,\nthere is an unique map \u03c8 : Pn \u2192 An satisfying:\n(1) Equivariance: \u03c8(B * \u03b3) = \u03c6B (\u03c8(\u03b3)) for any B \u2208 Bn and \u03b3 \u2208 Pn ,\nwhere B * \u03b3 denotes the action of B on \u03b3;\n\n\f18\n\nL.

Wrapping a braid around the line l to create the\nknot K, and a close-up of the area around the disk D.\n(2) Framing: if \u03b3 is a framed arc with \u03b3(0) = pj , then \u03c8(\u03b3j \u03b3) = \u03bc\u03c8(\u03b3),\nwhere \u03b3j \u03b3 denotes the framed arc obtained by concatenating \u03b3j and\n\u03b3m and similarly if \u03b3(1) = pl , then \u03c8(\u03b3\u03b3l ) = \u03bc\u03c8(\u03b3);\n(3) Normalization: \u03c8(\u03b3ij ) = \u2212aij if i < j, \u03c8(\u03b3ij ) = \u2212\u03bcaij if i > j, and\n\u03c8(\u03b3i0 ) = 1 + \u03bc where \u03b3i0 is the trivial cord which is constant at qi .\nFurthermore, we have the following skein relations for framed cords:\n\u03c8(\n\n) + \u03c8(\n\n) = \u03c8(\n\n)\u03c8(\n\n),\n\n\u03c8(\n\n) + \u03c8(\n\n) = \u03c8(\n\n)\u03c8(\n\n).\n\nFinally, the above skein relations, along with (2) and (3), suffice to define\n\u03c8.\nNote that the normalization of (3) has been chosen for compatibility with\nqk\nq k+1\n(1) and (2): \u03c3k sends \u03b3k,k+1 to\npk\np k+1 , which is mapped under \u03c8 to\n\u03bc\u22121 \u03c8(\u03b3k+1,k ). The main difference between Proposition 3.4 and the corresponding results from [16] is the framing axiom, which incorporates the\nvariable \u03bc into the map \u03c8.\nProof of Theorem 2.10 (cf. [16, \u00a73.2]). Suppose that the knot K is the closure of a braid B \u2208 Bn , with framing induced from the braid. If l is a line in\nR3 , then R3 \\ l is topologically a solid torus S 1 \u00d7 D 2 ; let D be a D 2 fiber of\nthis solid torus, viewed as sitting in R3 . The complement of D in S 1 \u00d7 D 2 is\na solid cylinder in which we can embed B, and the closure of this embedding\nin R3 is precisely K.\nNow K intersects D in n points p1 , . . . , pn , and the framing of K allows\nus to push K off of itself to obtain another knot K \u2032 , which then intersects D\nin points q1 , . . . , qn . Choose the base point \u2217 on K, which we need to define\nthe cord algebra, to be just beyond p1 in the direction of the orientation of\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n19\n\nK. See Figure 4. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let \u03b7i denote the path along K \u2032 running\nfrom qi to q1 in the direction of the orientation of K (so that it does not\npass \u2217).\nAny cord \u03b3 of K, in the sense of Definition 2.3, can be homotoped to lie\nentirely in D; a slight perturbation of the ends yields a framed cord \u03b3\u0303 of\n(D, P, Q), in the sense of Definition 3.3, say beginning at qi and ending at\nqj . Now the perturbation yielding \u03b3\u0303 is not uniquely defined up to homotopy,\nand so \u03c8(\u03b3\u0303) is defined in An only up to multiplication by powers of \u03bc. We\ncan however compensate for this by considering the linking number of K\nand the closed oriented curve \u03b3\u0303 \u222a \u03b7j \u222a (\u2212\u03b7i ). More precisely, it is easy to\ncheck that \u03bclk(K,\u03b3\u0303\u222a\u03b7j \u222a(\u2212\u03b7i )) \u03c8(\u03b3\u0303) is well-defined. Given a cord of K lying in\nD, we hence get an element of An which we denote by \u03c8\u0303(\u03b3). Moreover,\nthe skein relation defining the cord algebra maps to the skein relation in\nProposition 3.4.\nWe conclude that the cord algebra of K is a quotient of An ; this quotient\narises from the non-uniqueness of the homotopy from an arbitrary cord of K\nto a cord of K lying in D. Now the argument of the proof of [16, Thm. 1.3]\nshows that the cord algebra of K is An /I, where I is the subalgebra of An\nR\n\u22121\ngenerated by the entries of the matrices (1\u2212 \u039b*\u03a6L\nB )*A and A*(1\u2212 \u03a6B *\u039b ).\n(The reason that we need the entries of A above the diagonal to be of the\nform \u03bcaij , rather than aij as in [16], is because in this case the map \u03c8 sends\n\u03b3ij to \u2212\u03bcaij rather than \u2212aij .) But An /I is precisely the degree 0 homology\nof the framed knot DGA of K.\n\u0003\n4. Properties of the Invariants\n4.1. Symmetries. The cord algebra and framed knot DGA invariants change\nin predictable manners when we change the framed knot by various elementary operations: framing change, mirror, and inversion. Here, as usual,\n\"inversion\" refers to reversing the orientation of the knot, and the framing\nunder mirror and inversion is the induced framing from the original knot.\nThe effects of these operations are easiest to see in the homotopy interpretation of the framed cord algebra (Definition 2.2). As mentioned previously,\nchanging the framing of a knot by f keeps the meridian fixed and changes the\nlongitude by the corresponding power of the meridian; hence the framed cord\nalgebra changes by replacing \u03bb by \u03bb\u03bcf . A reflection of three-space about a\nplane changes a framed knot into its mirror, maps the knot's longitude to\nits mirror's longitude, and maps the meridian to the mirror's meridian with\nthe opposite orientation; hence mirroring changes the framed cord algebra\nby replacing \u03bc by \u03bc\u22121 . Changing the orientation of a framed knot changes\nthe orientation of both its longitude and meridian, and so inversion replaces\n\u03bb by \u03bb\u22121 and \u03bc by \u03bc\u22121 .\nProposition 4.1. The framed cord algebra of a framed knot changes under\nthe following operations as shown: framing change by f , \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u03bcf ; mirror,\n\u03bc \u2192 \u03bc\u22121 ; inversion, \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u22121 and \u03bc \u2192 \u03bc\u22121 . In addition, the commutative\n\n\f20\n\nL. NG\n\nframed cord algebras (in which multiplication is commutative) of a knot and\nits inverse are isomorphic.\nProof. The only statement left to prove is the invariance of the commutative\nframed cord algebra under inversion. Let l, m be the longitude and meridian\nof a framed knot K; then l\u22121 , m\u22121 are the longitude and meridian of its\ninverse. The map sending \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) to \u03b3 \u22121 extends in a natural way\nto a map on the tensor algebra generated by \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K). This map descends\nto an isomorphism on the commutative framed cord algebras; the key point\nis that the relation [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] + [\u03b31 m\u03b32 ] = [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] in the cord algebra of K is\nmapped to\n[\u03b32\u22121 \u03b31\u22121 ] + [\u03b32\u22121 m\u22121 \u03b31\u22121 ] = [\u03b31 ]\u22121 [\u03b32 ]\u22121 = [\u03b32 ]\u22121 [\u03b31 ]\u22121 ,\nwhich is the corresponding relation for the cord algebra of the inverse of\nK.\n\u0003\nNot surprisingly, the same operations lead to the same transformations\nin \u03bb, \u03bc in the framed knot DGA, although the proof is not particularly\nenlightening. Define the commutative framed knot DGA of a knot to be the\nquotient of the framed knot DGA obtained by imposing sign-commutativity,\ni.e., vw = (\u22121)|v||w| wv. (Note that this does not specialize to the \"abelian\nknot DGA\" from [15] when we set \u03bb = \u03bc = 1; there does not seem to be a\nreasonable lift of the abelian knot DGA to group ring coefficients.)\nProposition 4.2. The framed knot DGA of a framed knot changes under\nframing change, mirroring, and inversion as in Proposition 4.1, and the\ncommutative framed knot DGAs of a knot and its inverse are equivalent.\nProof. Framing change has already been covered by Theorem 2.7.\nMirror: We follow the proof of Proposition 6.9 from [15], which is the\nanalogous result for the DGA over Z; see that proof for notation. If a\nframed knot K is given as the closure of a braid B \u2208 Bn , then the mirror of\nK (with the corresponding framing) is the closure of B \u2217 . Let (A, \u2202) be the\n \u0303 be the framed knot DGA for B \u2217 ,\nframed knot DGA for B, and let (\u00c3, \u2202)\n\u22121\nbut with \u03bc replaced by \u03bc and \u039b replaced by \u039b\u0303 = \u039bn , with notation as in\nSection 3.1; this is equivalent to the usual framed knot DGA for B \u2217 (with\n \u0303 are\n\u03bc \u2192 \u03bc\u22121 ) by Proposition 3.1. It suffices to show that (A, \u2202) and (\u00c3, \u2202)\ntamely isomorphic.\nAssemble the generators aij , \u00e3ij into matrices A, \u00c3 as usual, except that\n\u00c3 has \u03bc replaced by \u03bc\u22121 . If we set \u00e3n+1\u2212i,n+1\u2212j = aij as in the proof of\nL\n[15, Prop. 6.9], then we find that \u00c3 = \u03bc\u22121 \u039e(A), while \u03a6L\nB \u2217 (\u00c3) = \u039e(\u03a6B (A))\nR\nR\nand \u03a6B \u2217 (\u00c3) = \u039e(\u03a6B (A)).

As usual, assemble the generators of \u00c3 into matrices\n\u00c3, etc., except that \u00c3 has \u03bc replaced by \u03bc\u22121 . If we set \u00e3ij = aji for all\ni, j, then \u00c3 = \u03bc\u22121 At .

Presumably an\napplication to distinguish inverses would require some sort of involved calculation using noncommutative Gr\u00f6bner bases.\n4.2. Relation to the alternate knot DGA. It is immediate from the\ndefinition of the framed knot DGA that one can recover the knot DGA over\nZ from [15] by setting \u03bb = \u03bc = 1. What is less obvious is that the framed\nknot DGA also specializes to the \"alternate knot DGA\" from [15, \u00a79].\nProposition 4.3. The knot DGA is obtained from the framed knot DGA\nby setting \u03bb = \u03bc = 1; the alternate knot DGA is obtained from the framed\nknot DGA by setting \u03bb = \u03bc = \u22121.\nProof. Let B \u2208 Bn be a braid whose closure gives the desired framed knot,\nand note that, since B closes to a knot, w(B) \u2261 n + 1 (mod 2). Setting\n\n\f22\n\nL. NG\n\n\u03bb = \u03bc = \u22121 in the framed knot DGA for K is the same as setting \u03bc = \u22121,\n\u03bb = (\u22121)w(B)+1 = (\u22121)n in the framed knot DGA corresponding to B. The\nargument of the proof of Proposition 3.1 shows that \u039b can be replaced in\nthe definition of the framed knot DGA by any diagonal matrix, the product\nof whose diagonal entries is \u03bb. Since \u03bb = (\u22121)n , we can use the matrix\n\u22121 instead of \u039b in defining the framed knot DGA. Let (A, \u2202) denote the\n \u0303 denote the alternate knot DGA of B, and assemble\nresulting DGA, let (\u00c3, \u2202)\nthe generators of A and \u00c3 into matrices, as usual.\nIf we set aij = \u00e3ij if i < j and aij = \u2212\u00e3ij if i > j, then A = \u2212\u00c3. In\nthe notation of Section 9.1 of [15], since \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 are conjugate through the\nL\nautomorphism which negates aij for i > j, we have \u03a6\u0303L\nB (\u00c3) = \u03a6B (A) and\nR\n\u03a6\u0303R\nB (\u00c3) = \u03a6B (A). It follows readily from the definition of the alternate knot\nDGA that if we further set B\u0303 = \u2212B, C\u0303 = \u2212C, D\u0303 = \u2212D, \u1ebdi = \u2212ei , then\n \u0303 The proposition follows.\n\u2202 = \u2202.\n\u0003\nNote that there are, in fact, four natural projections of the framed knot\nDGA to an invariant over Z, corresponding to sending each of \u03bb, \u03bc to \u00b11.\nWe have seen that two of these projections yield the knot DGA and the\nalternate knot DGA from [15]. The other two seem to behave slightly less\nnicely. For instance, for two-bridge knots, it can be shown that both the\nknot DGA and the alternate knot DGA have degree 0 homology which can\nbe written as a quotient of Z[x] by a principal ideal. (For the knot DGA,\nthis was shown in [15, Thm. 7.1].) This is not the case for the other two\nprojections.\nAs an example, consider the left-handed trefoil examined in Section 2.3.\nFor \u03bb = \u03bc = 1, we obtain HC0 \u223c\n= Z[x]/(x2 + x \u2212 2), the knot DGA for the\ntrefoil, and for \u03bb = \u03bc = \u22121, HC0 \u223c\n= Z[x]/(x2 \u2212 x), the alternate knot DGA\nfor the trefoil. By contrast, we have HC0 \u223c\n= Z[x]/(x2 \u2212 x, 2x) when \u03bb = 1\n2\n\u223c\nand \u03bc = \u22121, and HC0 = Z[x]/(x + x \u2212 2, 2x) when \u03bb = \u22121 and \u03bc = 1.\nIt may be worth noting that, by Proposition 4.2, none of the projections\nto Z can detect mirrors or inverses, since \u03bb = \u03bb\u22121 and \u03bc = \u03bc\u22121 in all\ncases. We also remark that the \"special\" status of the cases \u03bb = \u03bc = 1 and\n\u03bb = \u03bc = \u22121 is an artifact of a choice of a particular spin structure on T 2 .\nMore precisely, the signs in the definition of the framed knot DGA, which\narise from a coherent choice of orientations of the relevant moduli spaces,\ndepend on a choice of one of the (four) spin structures on the Legendrian\n2-torus; changing the spin structure negates either or both of \u03bb and \u03bc. See\n[6].\n4.3. Framed knot contact homology and the Alexander polynomial.\nIt has been demonstrated in [16, \u00a77.2] that a linearized version of knot\ncontact homology over Z encodes the determinant of the knot. Here we\nshow that the framed knot DGA has a similar natural linearization, with\nrespect to which we can deduce the Alexander polynomial of the knot.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n23\n\nLet K be a knot, and let (A, \u2202) denote the DGA over Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ] obtained\nby setting \u03bb = 1 in the framed knot DGA of K. To define a linearization of\n(A, \u2202), we need an augmentation of (A, \u2202) over Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ], that is, an algebra\nmap \u01eb : A \u2192 Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ] which is 0 in nonzero degrees and satisfies \u01eb \u25e6 \u2202 = 0.\nIn this case, an augmentation is just a ring homomorphism from the cord\nalgebra of K with \u03bb = 1 to Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ]. There is a natural choice for such\na homomorphism, namely the one which sends every cord to 1 + \u03bc; this\nclearly satisfies the relations for the cord algebra.\nIf \u01eb denotes the corresponding augmentation, which we call the distinguished augmentation of the framed knot DGA, then we can construct a\nlinearized version of (A, \u2202) in the standard way. Let M be the subalgebra\nof A generated by all words (in aij , bij , cij , dij , ei ) of length at least 1,\nand let \u03c6\u01eb : A \u2192 A be the algebra isomorphism sending each generator g\nof A to g + \u01eb(g). The differential \u03c6\u01eb \u25e6 \u2202 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n\u01eb maps M to itself and hence\ndescends to a differential \u2202\u01eblin on the free Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ]-module M/M2 . We define\nthe linearized framed contact homology of K, written HC\u2217lin (K), to be the\ngraded homology of \u2202\u01eblin .\nTo relate linearized homology to the Alexander polynomial, we recall some\nelementary knot theory adapted from [17]. Fix a knot K in S 3 , and let X\u0303K\ndenote the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement. Then H1 (X\u0303K )\nhas a natural Z[t\u00b11 ] module structure, with respect to which it is called\nthe Alexander invariant. The Alexander polynomial \u2206K (t) can be deduced\nfrom the Alexander invariant in the usual way; in particular, if the Alexander invariant is cyclic of the form Z[t\u00b11 ]/(p(t)), then p(t) is the Alexander\npolynomial up to units.\nProposition 4.4. If K is a knot, then we have an isomorphism of Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]modules\nHC lin (K) \u2297 Q \u223c\n= (H1 (X\u0303K ) \u2295 Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]) \u2297 (H1 (X\u0303K ) \u2295 Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]) \u2295 (Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ])m\n1\n\nfor some m \u2265 0. Here H1 (X\u0303K ) is understood to be a Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]-module by\nsetting t = \u2212\u03bc.\nBefore proving for Proposition 4.4, we note that the result, along with\nsome simple linear algebra, implies that we can calculate the Alexander\npolynomial from HC1lin .\nCorollary 4.5. The framed knot DGA with \u03bb = 1, along with the distinguished augmentation of the DGA, determines the Alexander polynomial.\nProof. Suppose that the invariant factors for the Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]-module H1 (X\u0303K )\nare p1 , . . . , pk \u2208 Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ], with p1 | * * * |pk , so that p1 . . . pk is some rational multiple of the Alexander polynomial. Then the invariant factors of\n(H1 (X\u0303K ) \u2295 Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]) \u2297 (H1 (X\u0303K ) \u2295 Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ]) \u2295 (Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ])m are gcd(pi , pj ) for\n1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k, along with 2k additional invariant factors which consist of\np1 , . . . , pk with multiplicity 2 each. In other words, the invariant factors of\nHC1lin (K) are p1 with multiplicity 2k + 1, p2 with multiplicity 2k \u2212 1, . . . , pk\n\n\f24\n\nL. NG\n\np1\n\np'1\n\np2\n\np'2\n\np3\n\np'3\n\nFigure 5.

This\ngives us the Alexander polynomial up to a constant factor, which can be\neliminated via the normalization \u2206K (1) = 1.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Proposition 4.4 will occupy the remainder of this section. It\nis nearly identical to the proof of the analogous Proposition 7.8 from [15]\nand is rather unilluminating, and the reader may wish to skip it.\nWe first give an explicit description of the distinguished augmentation for\na framed knot DGA, as derived by inspecting the translation between cords\nand framed knot contact homology from the proof of Theorem 2.10. Let\nB \u2208 Bn be a braid which closes to a knot. Draw B from right to left with\n\u03c3k giving a crossing where strand k crosses over strand k + 1, viewed from\nthe right; see Figure 5. Write p1 , . . . , pn for the leftmost endpoints of the\nbraid, and p\u20321 , . . . , p\u2032n for the rightmost endpoints. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, traverse\nthe braid from left to right, beginning at pi and looping around (that is,\nidentify p\u2032j with pj ) until p1 is reached; this traces out a path on the braid,\nwhich we define to be trivial when i = 1. Now let ri be the signed number of\nundercrossings traversed by this path, where an undercrossing contributes 1\nor \u22121 depending on whether it corresponds to a braid generator \u03c3k or \u03c3k\u22121 .\nFinally, define vB to be the vector (\u03bcr1 , . . . , \u03bcrn ).\nRecall from Section 3.1 that \u2206(v) is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal\nentries are the entries of v, and let \u0398 denote the n \u00d7 n matrix whose entries\nare all \u2212\u03bc \u2212 1.\nDefinition 4.6. The distinguished augmentation of the framed knot DGA\nof a braid B \u2208 Bn is the map which sends\nA 7\u2192 \u2206(vB ) * \u0398 * \u2206(vB )\u22121 ;\nin other words, it sends aij to \u03bcri \u2212rj (\u2212\u03bc \u2212 1) if i > j and \u03bcri \u2212rj \u22121 (\u2212\u03bc \u2212 1)\nif i < j.\nWe will see shortly that the distinguished augmentation is, in fact, an\naugmentation.\nA bit more notation: let \u039bB denote the matrix \u039b with \u03bb set to \u03bc\u2212w(B)\nwhere w(B) is the writhe of B; that is, \u039bB = \u2206((\u03bc\u2212w(B) , 1, . . . , 1)). Define\nthe vector uB to be (\u03bcs1 , . . . , \u03bcsn ), where si is the signed number of undercrossings traversed if we begin at pi , travel from left to right, and end when\nwe reach the right hand end of the braid; see Figure 5.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n25\n\nAlso, let B\u0302 be the braid obtained by reversing the word which gives B.\nFinally, let Bur denote the Burau representation on Bn , defined over Z[t\u00b11 ],\nso that Bur\u03c3k is the n \u00d7 n matrix which is the identity except from the\u0001 2 \u00d7 2\nt\nsubmatrix formed by the k, k + 1 rows and columns, which is 1\u2212t\n1 0 . We\nnow give a series of lemmas, culminating in the proof of Proposition 4.4.\nLemma 4.7. Let vk denote the vector (1, . . . , 1, \u03bc, 1, . . . , 1), with \u03bc in the\nk-th position. Then\n\u03c6\u03c3k (\u0398) = \u2206(vk ) * \u0398k * \u2206(vk )\u22121 ,\n\u0001\n\u03a6L\n\u03c3k (\u0398) = \u2206(vk ) * Bur\u03c3k |t=\u22121/\u03bc ,\n\nT\n\u22121\n\u03a6R\n\u03c3k (\u0398) = (Bur\u03c3k |t=\u2212\u03bc ) * \u2206(vk ) ,\n\nwhere\n\nT\n\ndenotes transpose.\n\nProof. Easy calculation using the definitions, along with the expressions for\nR\n\u0003\n\u03a6L\n\u03c3k and \u03a6\u03c3k from [15, Lemma 4.6].\nLemma 4.8.

We will establish the formula for \u03a6L\nB (\u0398), with \u03a6B (\u0398) established\nsimilarly. The second equality follows from the fact that si = ri \u2212 rs(B)(i)\nfor i \u2265 2 and s1 = r1 \u2212 rs(B)(1) + w(B). To prove the first equality, we use\ninduction, noting that uB can be defined even when B closes to a multicomponent link rather than a knot.\nBy [15, Prop. 4.4], Lemma 3.2, and Lemma 4.7, we have\nL\n\u22121\nL\n\u03a6L\n\u03c3k B (\u0398) = \u03a6B (\u2206(vk ) * \u0398 * \u2206(vk ) ) * \u03a6\u03c3k (\u0398)\n\u22121\n= \u2206(s(B)vk ) * \u03a6L\nB (\u0398) * \u2206(vk )\n\n\u0001\n= \u2206(u\u03c3k B ) * \u2206(uB )\u22121 * \u03a6L\nB (\u0398) * Bur\u03c3k |t=\u22121/\u03bc .\n\nHence the formula holds for B if and only if it holds for \u03c3k B. Since it\ncertainly holds when B is the trivial braid, the formula holds for general B\nby induction.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.9.

If we\nchange variables by replacing B by \u2206(vB ) * B * \u2206(vB )\u22121 and similarly for\n\u0001\nC, D, E, F , then the differential becomes \u2202\u01eblin E = B \u2212 D \u2212 C * BurB\u0302 |t=\u22121/\u03bc ,\n\u0001\n\u2202\u01eblin F = B \u2212 C \u2212 BurB\u0302 |t=\u2212\u03bc * D.\nThe matrices BurB\u0302 |t=\u22121/\u03bc and BurB\u0302 |t=\u2212\u03bc both give presentations over\nQ[t\u00b11 ] for the Alexander invariant of K, or, more precisely, for the direct sum\nof the Alexander polynomial and a free summand Q[t\u00b11 ], once we identify\nt with \u2212\u03bc. (Note that the Alexander invariant is unchanged if we invert t.)\nIt is now straightforward to deduce the proposition; just use the method of\nthe proof of [15, Prop. 7.8], working over the ring Q[\u03bc\u00b11 ] rather than Z. \u0003\n5. Invariants from Augmentation\nIn this section, we focus on applications of framed knot contact homology.\nThe essential difficulty is that it is a nontrivial task to determine when\ntwo DGAs over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] are equivalent. To obtain some computable\ninvariants, we consider augmentations of the DGA. These give rise to a\nlarge family of readily calculable numerical invariants of knots (Section 5.1),\nas well as a 2-variable polynomial with very strong ties to the A-polynomial\n(Section 5.2).\n5.1. Augmentation numbers. Let k be a field, and k\u2217 = k \\ {0}. Any\npair (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 (k\u2217 )2 gives rise to a map Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ] \u2297 k \u2192 k by sending \u03bb\nto \u03bb0 and \u03bc to \u03bc0 . If (A, \u2202) is a DGA over Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], then (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) allows\nus to project A \u2297 k, which is an algebra over k[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], to an algebra over\nk, which we write as A|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) .\nDefinition 5.1. An augmentation of a DGA (A, \u2202) over a field k is an\nalgebra map \u03b5 : A \u2192 k such that \u03b5(1) = 1, \u03b5(a) = 0 if a \u2208 A has pure\nnonzero degree, and \u03b5 \u25e6 \u2202 = 0.\nIf k is finite and A is finitely generated as an algebra, then there are only\nfinitely many possible augmentations.\nDefinition 5.2. Let K be a knot with framed DGA (A, \u2202), let k be a finite\nfield, and let (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 (k\u2217 )2 . The augmentation number Aug(K, k, \u03bb0 , \u03bc0 )\nis the number of augmentations of A|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) over k.\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n27\n\nFigure 6. The Kinoshita\u2013Terasaka knot (left) and Conway\nmutant (right).\nSince a knot has many different framed DGAs depending on its braid representative, Definition 5.2 technically requires proof of invariance; however,\nsince framed knot DGAs have generators only in nonnegative degree, it is\neasy to see that an augmentation of A|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) is the same as an algebra\nmap (HC0 (K) \u2297 k)|\u03bb=\u03bb0 ,\u03bc=\u03bc0 \u2192 k, and so augmentation numbers are welldefined.\nFrom Section 2.4, if the bridge number of a knot K is m, then there\nis a way to write HC0 (K) as an algebra with m(m \u2212 1) generators and\n2m2 relations. Calculating an augmentation number Aug(K, k, \u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) then\ninvolves counting how many of the possible |k|m(m\u22121) maps of the generators\nto k satisfy the relations; this can be readily done by computer when |k| is\nsmall enough.\nIn particular, if p is a prime, the finite field Zp gives rise to (p \u2212 1)2\naugmentation numbers of a knot, corresponding to the different choices of\n(\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ), each of which is a knot invariant. It can be calculated without\ntoo much effort that nearly any pair of nonisotopic knots with 8 or fewer\ncrossings can be distinguished by one of the 69 total augmentation numbers\nfor Zp with p = 2, 3, 5, 7. The only pairs not so distinguished are the knot\n815 and its mirror, and the connect sum 31 #51 and its mirror; each of these\npairs share the same augmentation numbers over fields up to Z7 but can be\ndistinguished using augmentation numbers over Z11 .\nAs an application of augmentation numbers, we can calculate that the\nKinoshita\u2013Terasaka knot and its Conway mutant, as shown in Figure 6, do\nnot have all the same augmentation numbers: Aug(KT, Z7 , 3, 5) = 2 while\nAug(Conway, Z7 , 3, 5) = 1. The author's web page includes a Mathematica\nprogram to calculate augmentation numbers.\nProposition 5.3. The Kinoshita\u2013Terasaka knot and its Conway mutant\nhave nonisomorphic cord algebras (and thus inequivalent framed knot DGAs).\nWe conclude that augmentation numbers are a rather effective tool to\ndistinguish between knots. It is not known to the author whether there are\ntwo nonisotopic knots which share the same augmentation numbers for all\nfields Zp .\n\n\f28\n\nL. NG\n\n5.2. The augmentation polynomial. Here we consider augmentations,\nas in the previous section, but now over the field C. If we fix (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 (C\u2217 )2\nand a knot K, then we obtain a DGA (A|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) , \u2202) over C, and we can ask\nwhether this DGA has an augmentation, i.e., whether there is an algebra\nmap (HC0 (K) \u2297 C)|\u03bb=\u03bb0 ,\u03bc=\u03bc0 \u2192 C. Since HC0 (K) is finitely generated\nand finitely presented, this is just a question in elimination theory, and the\n(closure of the) locus of (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) for which the DGA has an augmentation is\nan algebraic set.\nDefinition 5.4. Let K be a knot, with framed knot DGA (A, \u2202). The set\n{(\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 (C\u2217 )2 : (A|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) , \u2202) has an augmentation} is called the augmentation variety of K. If the augmentation variety is not 2-dimensional\n(and thus a Zariski open subset of (C\u2217 )2 ), then the union of its 1-dimensional\ncomponents is the zero set of the augmentation polynomial \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2208\nC[\u03bb, \u03bc], which is unique up to constant multiplication once we specify that\nit has no repeated factors and is not divisible by \u03bb or \u03bc.\nThe author does not know of any examples for which the augmentation\nvariety has any components which are not 1-dimensional.\nConjecture 5.5. The augmentation polynomial is defined for all knots in\nS 3.\nProposition 5.6. The augmentation polynomial \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc) is always divisible by (\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1).\nProof. If \u03bb0 = 1, then there is a map from HC0 (K)|(1,\u03bc0 ) to C sending all\ncords to 1 + \u03bc; if \u03bc0 = \u22121, then there is a trivial map from HC0 (K)|(\u03bb0 ,\u22121)\nto C sending all cords to 0.\n\u0003\nWe computed in Section 2.1 that the cord algebra for the unknot is\nZ[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ]/((\u03bb\u22121)(\u03bc+1)); hence the unknot has augmentation polynomial\n\u00c30 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1).\nA slightly more interesting case is the right hand trefoil, for which we computed in Section 2.4 that the cord algebra is (Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ])[x]/(x2 \u2212 x \u2212\n\u03bb\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc, x2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bcx \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc). For this to have a map to C, we need the two\npolynomials generating the ideal to have a common root. Their resultant\nis \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc3 ), and so the right hand trefoil has augmentation\npolynomial\n\u00c331 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc3 ).\nWe will give some more computations of augmentation polynomials shortly,\nbut first we establish a couple more properties of augmentation polynomi.\nals. For Laurent polynomials in Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ], let = denote equality up to\nmultiplication by a unit in Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ].\nProposition 5.7. The augmentation polynomial is independent of the orientation of the knot. If K is a knot with mirror K, then\n.\n.\n\u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc) = \u00c3K (\u03bb\u22121 , \u03bc\u22121 )\nand\n\u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc) = \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc\u22121 ).\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n29\n\nProof. Follows immediately from Proposition 4.1; note that the augmentation polynomial depends only on the commutative framed cord algebra,\nrather than the noncommutative version.\n\u0003\nNote also that one can define an augmentation polynomial for knots with\narbitrary framing f by using the f -framed knot DGA instead of the 0-framed\nknot DGA; then the augmentation polynomial of a knot K with framing f\nis \u00c3K (\u03bb\u03bc\u2212f , \u03bc).\nProposition 5.8. The augmentation variety VK1 #K2 for a connect sum\nK1 #K2 is related to the augmentation varieties VK1 , VK2 for K1 , K2 as follows:\nVK1 #K2 = {(\u03bb1 \u03bb2 , \u03bc) \u2208 (C\u2217 )2 | (\u03bb1 , \u03bc) \u2208 VK1 and (\u03bb2 , \u03bc) \u2208 VK2 }.\nThis formula defines \u00c3K1 #K2 in terms of \u00c3K1 and \u00c3K2 . In particular, both\n\u00c3K1 and \u00c3K2 divide \u00c3K1 #K2 .\nProof. Since {\u03bc = \u22121} is a component of all augmentation varieties, it\nsuffices to prove the equality in the statement in the complement of this\ncomponent.\nBy Van Kampen's Theorem, \u03c01 (S 3 \\ (K1 #K2 )) is the free product of\n\u03c01 (S 3 \\ K1 ) and \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K2 ), modulo the identification of the two meridians.\nThus there are elements l1 , l2 , m \u2208 \u03c01 (S 3 \\(K1 #K2 )) such that l1 l2 , m are the\nlongitude and meridian classes of K1 #K2 , and li , m project to the longitude\nand meridian classes in \u03c01 (S 3 \\ Ki ) for i = 1, 2.\nA map p : HC0 (K1 #K2 )|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) \u2192 C with \u03bc0 6= \u22121 sends [l1 ], [l2 ] to\ncomplex numbers which we write as \u03bb0,1 (1 + \u03bc0 ), \u03bb0,2 (1 + \u03bc0 ). We claim\nthat p induces maps from HC0 (Ki )|(\u03bb0,i ,\u03bc0 ) to C. The only relation for\nHC0 (Ki )|(\u03bb0,i ,\u03bc0 ) from Definition 2.2 that is not trivially preserved by p is\n[\u03b3li ] = [li \u03b3] = \u03bb0,i [\u03b3]. But in HC0 (K1 #K2 )|(\u03bb0 ,\u03bc0 ) , we have\n[\u03b3][li ] = [\u03b3li ] + [\u03b3mli ] = [\u03b3li ] + [\u03b3li m] = (1 + \u03bc0 )[\u03b3li ],\nand so p([\u03b3li ]) = p([\u03b3][li ])/(1+\u03bc0 ) = \u03bb0,i p([\u03b3]). Similarly p([li \u03b3]) = \u03bb0,i p([\u03b3]),\nand so p does indeed restrict to maps from HC0 (Ki )|(\u03bb0,i ,\u03bc0 ) to C. In addition, we have\n\u03bb0 (1 + \u03bc0 ) = p([l]) = p([l1 l2 ]) = \u03bb0,1 p([l2 ]) = \u03bb0,1 \u03bb0,2 (1 + \u03bc0 ).\nWe conclude that if (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 VK1 #K2 , then there exist \u03bb0,1 , \u03bb0,2 with\n\u03bb0,1 \u03bb0,2 = \u03bb0 such that (\u03bb0,i , \u03bc0 ) \u2208 VKi for i = 1, 2.\nConversely, suppose that we are given maps pi : HC0 (Ki )|(\u03bb0,i ,\u03bc0 ) \u2192 C.\nWe construct a map p : HC0 (K1 #K2 )|(\u03bb0,1 \u03bb0,2 ,\u03bc0 ) \u2192 C as follows: if \u03b3j,i \u2208\n\u03c01 (S 3 \\ Ki ) for i = 1, 2 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, then\np([\u03b31,1 \u03b31,2 * * * \u03b3k,1 \u03b3k,2 ]) =\n\np1 ([\u03b31,1 ])p2 ([\u03b31,2 ]) * * * p1 ([\u03b3k,1 ])p2 ([\u03b3k,2 ])\n.\n(1 + \u03bc0 )k\u22121\n\nSince any element of \u03c01 (S 3 \\(K1 #K2 )) can be written in the form \u03b31,1 \u03b31,2 * * * \u03b3k,1 \u03b3k,2 ,\nthis defines p on HC0 (K1 #K2 )|(\u03bb0,1 \u03bb0,2 ,\u03bc0 ) . It is straightforward to check\n\n\f30\n\nL. NG\n\nthat p preserves the relations defining HC0 (K1 #K2 )|(\u03bb0,1 \u03bb0,2 ,\u03bc0 ) and is hence\nwell-defined.\n\u0003\nTo illustrate Proposition 5.8, we can calculate that the augmentation\npolynomial for the connect sum of two right hand trefoils is\n\u00c331 #31 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc3 )(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc6 ),\nwhile the augmentation polynomial for the connect sum of a left hand trefoil\nand a right hand trefoil is\n\u00c331 #31 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bc + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc3 )(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc3 ).\n5.3. The augmentation polynomial and the A-polynomial. The augmentation polynomial is very closely related to the A-polynomial introduced\nby Cooper et al. in [2], which we briefly review here. Let K \u2208 S 3 be a knot,\nand let l, m denote the longitude and meridian classes in \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K), as\nusual. Consider a representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) \u2192 SL2 C. Since l, m commute, \u03c1 is conjugate to a representation in which \u03c1(l) and \u03c1(m) are upper\ntriangular, and so we restrict our attention to representations \u03c1 with this\nproperty. There is a map from SL2 C-representations of \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) to (C\u2217 )2\nsending \u03c1 to ((\u03c1(l))11 , (\u03c1(m))11 ), where M11 denotes the top left entry of M ,\nand the 1-dimensional part of the image of this map forms a variety, which\nis the zero set of the A-polynomial AK \u2208 C[\u03bb, \u03bc]. (Note that we are thus\nassuming the convention that \u03bb \u2212 1 always divides AK .)\nThe following result shows that the A-polynomial is subsumed in the \u00c3polynomial. Note that the A-polynomial involves only even powers of \u03bc [2,\nProp. 2.9].\nProposition 5.9. Let AK (\u03bb, \u03bc), \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc) denote the A-polynomial and\naugmentation polynomial of a knot K. Then\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )AK (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc2 ).\nProof. From [2, \u00a72.8], \u03bc \u00b1 1 does not divide the A-polynomial. On the other\nhand, by Proposition 5.6, \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc2 ) is divisible by 1 \u2212 \u03bc2 . It thus suffices\nto prove that AK (\u03bb, \u03bc) divides \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc2 ).\nSuppose that we have an SL2 C-representation \u03c1 of \u03c01 (S 3 \\K) which maps\nto (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 ) in (C\u2217 )2 . We wish to show that there is a map from the cord\nalgebra of K with (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb0 , \u2212\u03bc20 ) to C. Since \u03bc+1 is a factor of \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u03bc),\nwe may assume that \u03bc0 6= \u00b11. Then we can conjugate \u03c1 so that it becomes\ndiagonal on the peripheral subgroup:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb0\n0\n\u03bc0\n0\n\u03c1(l) =\nand\n\u03c1(m) =\n.\n0 \u03bb\u22121\n0 \u03bc\u22121\n0\n0\nWe use the formulation of the cord algebra from Definition 2.2, with \u03bb\nreplaced by \u03bb0 and \u03bc replaced by \u2212\u03bc20 ; we can change variables by replacing each generator [\u03b3] by (1 \u2212 \u03bc20 )(\u2212\u03bc0 )lk(\u03b3,K) [\u03b3] to obtain an algebra with\ndefining relations\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n31\n\n(1) [e] = 1;\n(2) [\u03b3m] = [m\u03b3] = \u03bc0 [\u03b3] and [\u03b3l] = [l\u03b3] = \u03bb0 [\u03b3];\n(3) [\u03b31 \u03b32 ] \u2212 \u03bc0 [\u03b31 m\u03b32 ] = (1 \u2212 \u03bc20 )[\u03b31 ][\u03b32 ].\nNow if we send each generator [\u03b3] to the top left entry of \u03c1(\u03b3), it is easy to\ncheck that the above relations are preserved, and so we obtain a map from\n\u0003\nthe cord algebra to C with (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb0 , \u2212\u03bc20 ), as desired.\nProposition 5.9 has some immediate consequences. The first uses a result\nof Dunfield and Garoufalidis [3] which is based on work of Kronheimer and\nMrowka [13] on knot surgery and SU2 representations.\nProposition 5.10. The cord algebra distinguishes the unknot from any\nother knot in S 3 .\nProof. We have seen that the cord algebra for the unknot is Z[\u03bb\u00b11 , \u03bc\u00b11 ]/((\u03bb\u2212\n1)(\u03bc + 1)), and so the augmentation variety for the unknot is the union of\nthe lines \u03bb = 1 and \u03bc = \u22121. On the other hand, the main result of [3] states\nthat any nontrivial knot in S 3 has nontrivial A-polynomial (i.e., not equal\nto \u03bb \u2212 1). Hence the augmentation variety for a nontrivial knot either is\n2-dimensional or contains a nontrivial 1-dimensional component; in either\ncase, it strictly contains the augmentation variety for the unknot.\n\u0003\nThe next consequence of Proposition 5.9 relates the augmentation variety\nto the Alexander polynomial. By analogy with [2], say that a point (\u03bb0 , \u03bc0 )\nin the augmentation variety of K is reducible if \u03bb0 = 1 and the corresponding\nmap from the cord algebra (from Definition 2.4) to C sends every cord\nto 1 + \u03bc0 . (This is slightly bad notation: we mean a point which is on\na component of the augmentation variety different from \u03bb \u2212 1, with the\ncorresponding map from the cord algebra to C.)\nProposition 5.11. If \u2212\u03bc0 is a root of the Alexander polynomial \u2206K (t), then\n(1, \u03bc0 ) is a reducible point on a nontrivial component of the augmentation\nvariety of K.\nProof. This follows directly from [2, Prop. 6.2].\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now examine the difference between the augmentation polynomial and\nthe A-polynomial for some specific knots. It seems that the two polynomials\nessentially coincide for 2-bridge knots, but as of this writing, a proof has not\nbeen completed, and so the following \"result\" is presented as a conjecture.\nConjecture 5.12. If K is a 2-bridge knot, then\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )AK (\u03bb, \u03bc) = \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc2 ).\nOn the other hand, there are knots for which \u00c3K (\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc2 ) contains nontrivial factors not present in AK (\u03bb, \u03bc).

A quick calculation then shows that\nAT (3,4) (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)(1 + \u03bb\u03bc12 )(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc12 ).\nOn the other hand, we can define the cord algebra for T (3, 4) from Definition 2.6, using the braid (\u03c31 \u03c32 )\u22124 \u2208 B3 which closes to T (3, 4). It is\nstraightforward to check that if we set \u03bb = \u03bc\u22128 and a12 = a21 = a13 = a31 =\na23 = a32 = \u22121, then the relations defining the cord algebra for T (3, 4)\nvanish, and so 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc8 is a factor of \u00c3T (3,4) . In fact, a slightly more involved\ncalculation using resultants demonstrates that\n.\nBT (3,4) (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc8 =\n6 1.\nUsing Mathematica, one can compute the augmentation polynomials for\nmany other knots. In particular, for the non-two-bridge knots whose Apolynomials are computed in [2], we have\nB85 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc4 ;\nB820 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc2 ;\nBP (\u22122,3,7) (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc12 .\nThe author does not know whether there is any geometric significance to\nthe B-polynomial, as there is for the A-polynomial.\n6. Extensions of the Invariant\nIn Section 2.1, the cord algebra was defined for any connected cooriented\ncodimension 2 submanifold of any manifold. In fact, the cord algebra, and\nsometimes the full DGA invariant, can be defined for many geometric objects. Here we discuss extending the invariant to four settings other than\nknots in S 3 . What follows is expository and somewhat sketchy at points.\n6.1. Links in S 3 . The cord algebra can be defined for (oriented, framed)\nlinks in S 3 as for knots. For an n-component link L, the base ring is\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nZ[\u03bb\u00b11\n1 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bbn , \u03bcn ] since there are now n longitudes and n corresponding meridians in \u03c01 (S 3 \\L), and the relations in Definition 2.2 change accordingly. The cord algebra can be written in terms of cords and skein relations\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n33\n\nas for knots:\n= 1 + \u03bci ,\n\n*\n\n= \u03bbi\n\n*\n+ \u03bci\n\nand\n=\n\n*\n*\n\n= \u03bbi\n\n*\n\n,\n\n,\n\nwhere i is the label of the link component depicted in the skein relation.\nIt is possible to extend the framed knot DGA from Section 2.4 to an\ninvariant of links in such a way that the degree 0 homology of the DGA is\nthe cord algebra of the link; one just needs to supply \u03bb, \u03bc in the definition\nof the DGA with indices corresponding to components of the link. There is\nthen a canonical augmentation of the DGA which sends each aij to 1+ \u03bcn(i) ,\nwhere n(i) is the label of the link component containing strand i. It should\nbe the case that the linearized homology of the DGA with respect to this\naugmentation contains the multivariable Alexander polynomial of the link,\njust as the linearized homology of the framed knot DGA contains the usual\nAlexander polynomial of a knot; however, the author has not worked through\nthe detailed computation in general.\n6.2. Spatial graphs. As noted in [16], the cord algebra over Z extends\nnaturally to an invariant of spatial graphs (embedded graphs in S 3 ) modulo\nneighborhood equivalence; two spatial graphs are neighborhood equivalent\n(terminology by Suzuki) if they have ambient isotopic tubular neighborhoods. If \u0393 is a spatial graph and H1 (\u0393) has rank g, then one can lift the base\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nring of the cord algebra of \u0393 from Z to Z[\u03bb\u00b11\n1 , . . . , \u03bbg , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcg ], where\nthe \u03bbi represent generators of H1 (\u0393) and the \u03bci represent g linearly independent meridians. However, since the choices of longitudes and meridians are\nnot canonical in general, an isomorphism of cord algebras of neighborhood\nequivalent graphs may not fix the base ring.\nOne can also generalize the framed knot DGA to spatial graphs by using\nthe formulation from Section 2.4. Note that a diagram of \u0393 with, say, n\ncrossings will have n \u2212 g + 1 connected components. The DGA for \u0393 has\n(n \u2212 g + 1)(n \u2212 g) generators aij in degree 0, 2n(n \u2212 g + 1) generators b\u03b1i , ci\u03b1\nin degree 1, and n2 + n generators d\u03b1\u03b2 , e\u03b1 in degree 2; the differential is\nL\nas in Section 2.4, where \u03a8L , \u03a8L\n1 , \u03a82 are now n \u00d7 (n \u2212 g + 1) matrices and\nR\n\u03a8R , \u03a8R\n1 , \u03a82 are (n\u2212g+1)\u00d7n matrices. The proof that the DGA is invariant\nunder neighborhood equivalence is identical to the corresponding (omitted)\nproof of invariance for knots under isotopy.\nBy the definition of neighborhood equivalence, the cord algebra and framed\nknot DGA also yield isotopy invariants for any closed embedded surface in\nS 3 whose complement has a component which is a handlebody; simply consider the spatial graph given by the core of the handlebody. In general,\n\n\f34\n\nL. NG\n\nany embedded surface in R3 (or immersed surface without dangerous selftangencies) should yield a DGA and \"cord algebra\" from symplectic considerations, given by the Legendrian contact homology of its conormal bundle\n(Legendrian lift) in ST \u2217 R3 , but a combinatorial form for these invariants is\ncurrently unknown. When the surface arises as the boundary of a tubular\nneighborhood of a spatial graph, we conjecture that the DGA for the spatial\ngraph defined above calculates the Legendrian contact homology of the lift\nof the associated surface.\n6.3. Virtual and welded knots in S 3 . The framed knot DGA extends\neasily to virtual knots (for definitions, see e.g. [10]), via the formulation\nin Section 2.4. The definition of the invariant from Section 2.4 carries over\nwholesale, with the clarification that only actual crossings contribute; if\nthere are n non-virtual crossings, then they divide the diagram of the knot\ninto n components, each going from undercrossing to undercrossing, some\nof which may pass through virtual crossings. In particular, the cord algebra\ncan be defined for virtual knots as for usual knots, with the added stipulation\nthat endpoints of cords can move unobstructed through virtual crossings.\nBoth the cord algebra and the framed knot DGA constitute invariants of\nvirtual knots. In fact, they are invariants under a weaker equivalence, that\nof welded knots [18]. The fact that the cord algebra gives an invariant of\nwelded knots essentially follows from the proof that it gives an invariant of\nusual knots; one can also verify that the framed knot DGA is also invariant\nby checking the virtual Reidemeister moves and the relevant \"forbidden\"\nmove, along the lines of the discussion at the end of Section 2.4. We omit\nthe details here.\nThe extension of the framed knot DGA to welded knots is closely related\nto an extension of the braid homomorphism \u03c6 from Section 2.3 to the welded\nbraid group [11]. The welded braid group WBn adds to the usual braid group\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nBn (with generators {\u03c3k }k=1\n) a set of generators {\u03c4k }k=1\n, and relations \u03c4k2 =\n1, \u03c4k \u03c4k+1 \u03c4k = \u03c4k+1 \u03c4k \u03c4k+1 , \u03c4k \u03c4k+1 \u03c3k = \u03c3k+1 \u03c4k \u03c4k+1 , \u03c3k \u03c3k+1 \u03c4k = \u03c4k+1 \u03c3k \u03c3k+1 ,\nand \u03c4k \u03c4j = \u03c4j \u03c4k , \u03c3k \u03c4j = \u03c4j \u03c3k for |k \u2212 j| > 1. Now define \u03c6\u03c4k : An \u2192 An to\nact on generators aij by replacing the index k whenever it appears by k + 1\nand vice versa. It is easy to check that the relations in WBn are satisfied\nand hence \u03c6 descends to a homomorphism WBn \u2192 Aut An . Any welded\nknot is the closure of a welded braid, and one can use \u03c6 to give an alternate\ndefinition for the framed knot DGA of a welded knot.\nWe remark that the fact that the framed knot DGA extends to welded\nknots suggests that it may be related to knot quandles or racks. Indeed,\none presentation [12] of the fundamental rack of a framed knot K involves\nhomotopy classes of paths in S 3 \\ K from a fixed base point in S 3 to a\nparallel copy of K. By comparison, one can define the cord algebra of K to\nbe generated by paths in S 3 \\ K beginning and ending on a parallel copy of\nK, and a cord is then a juxtaposition of two elements of the fundamental\nrack. The defining relations for the cord algebra can be expressed in terms\n\n\fFRAMED KNOT CONTACT HOMOLOGY\n\n35\n\nof the binary operation on the fundamental rack, at least if we set \u03bb = 1 in\nthe cord algebra. A more precise correspondence between the cord algebra\nand the fundamental rack currently remains elusive, however.\n6.4. 2-knots in R4 . Definition 2.1 yields a definition of the cord algebra\nfor embedded surfaces (2-knots) in R4 which extends the cord ring from the\nappendix to [16]. We claim that this invariant is highly nontrivial. Let K\nbe a knot in R3 , and denote by K\u0303 the spun knot (topologically S 2 ) in R4\nobtained from K. Then \u03c01 (R4 \\ K\u0303) = \u03c01 (R3 \\ K), and H1 (\u2202\u03bd K\u0303) = Z is\ngenerated by the meridian m of K.\nIt follows that the cord algebra of K\u0303 is the tensor algebra over Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ]\nfreely generated by \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K), modulo the relations (1) and (3) from Definition 2.2. In other words, its defining relations are the same as those of\nthe cord algebra of K, but without [\u03b3l] = [l\u03b3] = \u03bb[\u03b3]. Equivalently, the cord\nalgebra of K\u0303 is the cord algebra of any long knot whose closure is K.\nUsing this formulation, one computes that the cord algebra of the unknotted S 2 in R4 (the spun unknot) is the base ring Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ], while the cord algebra\nof the spun trefoil (with either chirality) is Z[\u03bc\u00b11 ][x]/((x \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 1)(\u03bcx + 1)).\nSome indication of the strength of the cord algebra for spun knots comes\nfrom the following generalization of [16, Prop. A.6].\nProposition 6.1. The cord algebra distinguishes the spun version of any\nnontrivial knot from the unknotted S 2 \u2282 R4 .\nProof. Let K be a nontrivial knot. The nontriviality of the A-polynomial of\nK implies that for generic \u03bc0 \u2208 C\u2217 , there are at least two maps HC0 (K) \u2297\nC \u2192 C sending \u03bc to \u03bc0 (and \u03bb to any nonzero complex number). It follows\nthat there are at least two maps from the complexified cord algebra of K\u0303 to\nC sending \u03bc to \u03bc0 . This is not the case when K is the unknot.\n\u0003\nIt appears that the cord algebra may constitute an interesting invariant\nfor twist-spun knots as well, though computation of the cord algebra for\ntwist-spun knots might be a bit more involved than for spun knots.\nReferences\n[1] Yu.
