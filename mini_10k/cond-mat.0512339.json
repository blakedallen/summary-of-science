Introduction\nThe possibility of using polymers in various photonic applications such as flat\npanel displays and LEDs has led to increased interest in their electronic and optical\nproperties. Among the important classes of optically active polymers are conjugated\nsystems with alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds such as the\npolyfluorenes. Due to the nature of the bonding, which is analogous to the alternating\nbonding in benzene, the polymeric units have a planar or \"platelet\" character. Each\nplatelet is connected to neighboring identical platelets by a single bond. Rotation about\nthe bond can take place which leads to a situation where the individual platelets are\ncharacterized by local normal directions. In situations where the electron-phonon\ninteractions are weak, the low-lying optically active states are frequently singlet excitons\ninvolving the \u03c0 and \u03c0* orbitals of the platelets. In this paper we report the results of\ntheoretical studies of the effects of disorder on the distribution and localization of the\nexcitonic states and the corresponding excitonic spectra.\nOur approach is based on the Frenkel exciton picture in which we regard each\npolymeric unit as a single chromaphore, analogous to the situation in molecular crystals.\nThe corresponding Hamiltonian takes the form\n\nH = \u2211kEkck*ck \u2212 \u2211ktk,k+1(ck+1*ck+ck*ck+1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ek denotes the chromaphore transition energy, tk,k+1 is the transfer integral, and the\nck and ck* are exciton operators. In our analysis, we assume all of the transition energies\nare identical (i.e. no diagonal disorder) and that the transfer integral is proportional to the\ncosine of the angle between the normal vectors of platelets k and k+1 [1]. That is we\nhave\n\n2\n\n\ftk,k+1 = tcos(\u03c6k+1 \u2212\u03c6k) \u2261 tcos (\u2206\u03c6k,k+1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03c6k,k+1 is the relative angle of rotation between platelets k and k+1 [1]. The\ncorresponding Hamiltonian has the form\n\nH = \u2211kE0ck*ck \u2212 \u2211k tcos (\u2206\u03c6k,k+1) (ck+1*ck+ck*ck+1)\nIn this model, the disorder arises from random fluctuations in \u2206\u03c6.\n\n(3)\nTwo types of\n\nrotational disorder are considered: segmental disorder where \u2206\u03c6 = 0, except for large,\nrandom excursions [1], and continuous modulation in which there are small random\nfluctuations in \u2206\u03c6 between adjacent platelets. In the analysis we compare our results\nobtained assuming angular disorder with the corresponding results arising from random\nvariations in bond length with no angular disorder.\nIn the standard treatment of Frenkel excitons, the Hamiltonian (3) is transformed\ninto a set of coupled linear equations that take the form\n\n(E \u2013 Ek)ak= - tcos(\u2206\u03c6k,k+1)ak+1\u2212 tcos(\u2206\u03c6k-1,k)ak-1,\n\n(4)\n\nwith eigenvalues E\u03bd and orthonormal eigenvectors ak\u03bd, \u03bd = 1, 2,..., N , for a chain of N\nplatelets.\nThe distribution and localization of the exciton modes are characterized by the\ndensity of states and the inverse localization length, respectively, with the latter being the\nreciprocal of the number of platelets where the mode has significant amplitude. In the\ncase of one-dimensional arrays with nearest-neighbor interactions, both of these\nquantities can be determined by making use of mode-counting techniques [2,3]. In detail,\none introduces the amplitude ratios Rk = ak/ak\n\n\u22121\n\nand calculates Rk from the recursion\n\nrelation\n\n(E \u2013 Ek) = - tcos(\u2206\u03c6k,k+1)Rk+1 (E) \u2212 tcos(\u2206\u03c6k-1,k) /Rk (E)\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe density of states (DOS) and the inverse localization length (ILL) are\nexpressed in terms of the quantity\n\n\u03b3(E) = (1/N)\u03a3nN ln[Rn(E)]\n\n(6)\n\nby means of the equations [4]\n\nILL(E) = Re \u03b3(E)\n\n(7a)\n\nDOS(E) = (1/\u03c0)d[Im \u03b3(E)]/dE\n\n(7b)\n\nwhere Re and Im denote real and imaginary parts, respectively.\nThe absorption spectra are calculated from the equation\n\nI(E) = |\u03bc|2 \u03a3\u03bd =1N| \u03a3k akv| 2 \u03b4(E - Ev)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the optical transition matrix element. Note that unlike the DOS and ILL, the\nabsorption spectra is calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix associated with\nEq. (4).\n\nIn practice, one replaces the delta function appearing in Eq. (8) with a\n\nLorentzian or similar broadening function.\n\nII. Model Calculations\nIn the model calculations, we assume that the angular differences between\nadjacent platelets, \u2206\u03c6, are distributed at random according to the equation\n\nProb(\u2206\u03c6k+1,k = \u2206\u03c6) = c,\n\nProb(\u2206\u03c6k+1,k = 0) = 1 \u2013 c\n\n(9)\n\nwith no correlation between sites. We note that when \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 (cos\u2206\u03c6 = 0), the effect of\nthe fluctuations is to divided the polymer into ideal, independent segments of average\nlength 1/c, a situation that has been studied in detail by various authors (e.g. [5]). The\ncase \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0 is unusual in that a mathematical analysis, confirmed by numerical studies,\nshows that the density of states is the same as in an ideal chain (c = 0), and all of the\n\n4\n\n\fmodes are delocalized (ILL = 0). The eigenvectors, however, are not the same as for the\nideal chain, leading to optical spectra that broaden with increasing c (see Fig. 1).\nIn Figs. 2 \u2013 4 we display the density of states, the inverse localization length and\nthe optical spectra for \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/4 with c = 0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50. We see that the effects of\ndisorder on the DOS and ILL show up most strongly at the band edges. Toward the center\nthe states are more extended and the distribution resembles that of the ideal chain. The\noptical absorption is strongest near the lower band edge, consistent with the direct\nabsorption. With increasing disorder, the peak broadens and shifts toward the center of\nthe band. Although the spectra were calculated with one value of \u2206\u03c6, the results are\nrepresentative of the results obtained for other large, discrete changes in relative platelet\norientation apart from \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 and \u03c0.\nAs noted above, we have also explored the effects of small fluctuations in the\nrelative orientations of nearest-neighbor platelets. This was accomplished by giving \u2206\u03c6 a\nGaussian distribution centered at 0o with no correlation between sites. The results for the\nabsorption spectra with variance \u03c32, \u03c3 = 0o, 6o and 15o, are shown in Fig. 5. From this\nfigure it is evident that the effects of continuous disorder resemble those of segmental\ndisorder in that the peak in absorption broadens and moves toward the center of the band\nwith increasing disorder.\nAt high temperatures, one may approach a situation where \u2206\u03c6 is uniformly\ndistributed between 0 and 2\u03c0. In this limit the excitons are strongly localized (except at\nthe center of the band [6]), and the absorption spectrum resembles the density of states,\nwhich is shown in Fig. 6. One can understand this behavior from Eq. (8) by expanding |\n\u03a3k akv| 2. In a strongly disordered system, we have random phases so that terms in the\n\n5\n\n\fexpansion of the form akv ak' v* average to zero for k \u2260 k'. Thus, the expression |\u03a3k akv| 2\nreduces to \u03a3k |akv|2 = 1, since the eigenvectors are normalized. In this limit we obtain\n\nI(E) = |\u03bc|2 \u03a3\u03bd =1N\u03b4(E - Ev) \u2261 |\u03bc|2DOS(E)\n\n(10)\n\nIn other words, I(E) is proportional to the density of states.\n\nIII. Discussion\nThe most direct information about the excitons in conjugated polymers comes\nfrom studies that probe the absorption lineshape. As noted, isolated, large fluctuations\nand continuous small fluctuations in \u2206\u03c6 have qualitatively similar effects on the\nlineshape. In both cases the effect of the disorder is to broaden and shift the peak toward\nthe center of the band. This behavior is in contrast to the behavior found when the\ndisorder arises from fluctuations in bond length. This can be seen in a model calculation\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 = 0 and the transfer integral varies as\n\nt=1+X\n\n(11)\n\nwhere X has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance \u03c32. The absorption\nlineshapes and the corresponding densities of states calculated with \u03c3 = 0, 0.10, 0.25 and\n0.50 are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively.\n\nIt is apparent there are qualitative\n\ndifferences between the bond angle disorder and bond length disorder. In the latter, the\nabsorption peak shifts away from the band center with increasing disorder and develops\nexponential tails. The difference between Fig. 7 and Figs. 4 and 5 can be traced to the\nproperty that the magnitude of the transfer integral is bounded in the latter two cases, \u22121\n\u2264 tk+1,k \u2264 1, so that all of the eigenvalues lie between \u22122 and 2 as in systems with no\ndisorder.\n\nWith the Gaussian distribution of bond lengths, the eigenvalues are not\n\nbounded, and thus the states tail off from the upper and lower band edges (with a\n\n6\n\n\fsingularity at the center of the band [6]). Thus with angular disorder, one predicts a well\ndefined onset for the absorption whereas in the case of bond length disorder, one has a\nlineshape that reflects the tailing of the density of states. Note that a similar lineshape is\nalso obtained with a Gaussian distribution of transition energies, i.e. diagonal disorder\n[7].\nEvidence that supports the picture of angular disorder comes from measurements\nof the absorption and photoluminescence of the polyfluorene PF8 [8,9].\n\nIn these\n\nreferences, it was pointed out that the photoluminescence at low temperatures comes\nfrom a thermally populated band of \u03b2-exciton states associated with an absorption\nlineshape that varies as E3/2 near the edge. The authors of Ref. 9 were able to model the\nemission and photoluminescence profiles in an approach that incorporates both segmental\ndisorder (due to the admixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases with different torsion angles) and\ncontinuous disorder.\n\nAcknowledgment\nDLH would like to thank M.

Note that the spectral weight shifts toward the center of the band with\nincreasing disorder.\n\nFig. 2. Density of states vs E for \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/4 with c = 0, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 (Eq. (9)). Note\nthat the spectral weight shifts toward the center of the band with increasing\ndisorder, and there are no states with |E| > 2.\n\nFig. 3. Inverse localization length vs E for \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/4 with c = 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 (Eq.\n(9)). Note that the excitons are most localized near the band edges and the ILL\nincreases with increasing disorder.\n\nFig. 4. Absorption intensity vs E for \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/4 with c = 0, 0.10, 0.25 and\n0.50 (Eq. (9)). Note that the peak shifts toward the center of the band with\nincreasing disorder.\n\nFig. 5. Absorption intensity vs E for a Gaussian distribution of the fluctuations in \u2206\u03c6.\nResults are presented for different various values of the variance \u03c3 2: \u03c3 = 0o (no\ndisorder), 6o and 15o. Note that the peak shifts toward the center of the band with\nincreasing disorder.\n\n8\n\n\fFig. 6. Density of states vs E for a uniform distribution of the fluctuations in \u2206\u03c6, 0 \u2264\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. Note there are no states with |E| > 2.\n\nFig. 7. Absorption intensity vs E for bond length disorder. Results are presented for\nvarious values of the variance \u03c32: \u03c3 = 0 (no disorder), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50 (Eq.\n(11)). Note that the peak shifts away from the center of the band with increasing\ndisorder in contrast to what happens in the case of angular disorder.\n\nFig. 8. Density of states vs E for bond length disorder. Results are presented for various\nvalues of the variance \u03c32: \u03c3 = 0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50 (Eq. (11)).
