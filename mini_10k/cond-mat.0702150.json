There have recently been\nseveral examples of such systems where these inhomogeneities can occur intrinsically via quenched disorder in the system, or can occur spontaneously.\nFor example, impurities can be driven in a superconductor by irradiation\nor chemical substitution. On the other hand, holes in the cuprate superconductors or magnetic or charge ordered domains in manganites spontaneously arrange in geometric patterns like stripes or a checkerboard at certain fillings [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Using scanning tunneling microscopy evidence for\nelectronic inhomogeneity has been reported in the high-Tc superconductor\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+x by McElroy, et al. [2]. Most of the high-Tc materials are\nceramic in nature and inhomogeneities are present in even the best prepared\nsamples. This inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variations in both the\nlocal density of states and the superconducting energy gap[7].\nThere has been a number of theoretical attempts to understand the effect\nof quenched disorder in superconductors [8, 9]. In the context of repulsive\nmodels, both in the weak-coupling models and their strong-coupling counterparts, considerable numerical work has been done with inhomogeneities\n[10, 11]. In such cases stripes and checkerboard patterns have been reported\n\n\f[12, 13], the presence of d-wave superconductivity, however, is less convincing. Enhancement of Tc due to inhomogeneities in the weak-coupling regime\nis demonstrated by Martin et al. [14]. Aryanpour et al. [8] studied an s-wave\nsuperconductor with quenched disorder starting from a negative-U Hubbard\nmodel using a mean-field theory. The disorder enters in their model through\na random choice of two values of the attractive interaction (bimodal distribution) at different sites. Quite interestingly, it was shown that below a certain\nvalue of the average attraction, the zero temperature superconducting gap\nis larger than that of the homogeneous superconductor with same (uniform)\nattraction. Ghosal et al., [9] use an s-wave superconductor and look for\nthe effect of disorder using a mean-field treatment. Both these calculation\nobserve strong effects of disorder on the superconducting order parameters.\nIn certain specific cases, lower dimensional orders, like stripes or checkerboard order [5, 15] has been found [8] in the numerical calculations. One\npossible application of these inhomogeneities is to manipulate the degree of\nsuperconductivity and the transition temperature through varying degree of\ninhomogeneities. Another possibility is the study of the coupling of two adjacent systems, where superconductivity in either could be controlled by the\ndegree of disorder in them. In many of the tunneling devices such conditions\nare obtained.\nWe consider a similar situation with the local attractive interaction taken\ncompletely random, which, we believe, is more realistic than using a bimodal\ndistribution. We take a system of two such disordered, superconducting\nblocks connected by a channel. This model conforms to various actual situations in tunnel junctions and the study of them is quite interesting. We\nlook into the problem of disordered superconductivity and compare the results with homogeneous systems. Using mean-field exact diagonalization\ntechniques, we work out the case of random disorder (as opposed to forcing\nspecific geometrical patterns like stripes[8] from the outset) in a two dimensional square lattice and also for a system of two such blocks with a channel\nconnecting them. We compute various microscopic parameters such as the\nlocal pairing amplitude \u2206i , the average electron density ni , the local chemical\npotential \u03bci and the density of states for different fillings for various average\ninteractions. We also look for any emergent one dimensional pattern in the\nreal-space. The effect of coupling of two such systems is studied in detail.\n\n2\n\nModel and calculation\n\nOur starting point is the attractive Hubbard model given by\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n<ij>\u03c3\n\n(c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + c\u2020j\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ) \u2212 \u03bc\n\nX\ni\n\nc\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 \u2212\n\nX\n\n|Ui |n\u02c6i\u2191 n\u02c6i\u2193\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere t is the hopping potential, \u03bc is the chemical potential and Ui is the\nlocal attractive interaction between the fermion of the opposite spins residing\n\n\fon the same lattice site i. c\u2020i\u03c3 and ci\u03c3 are creation and destruction operators\nfor an electron with spin \u03c3 on site i, n\u0302i\u2191 and n\u0302i\u2193 are number operators at site\ni with spin up and down. Superconductivity and other charge instabilities in\nthe homogeneous case have been studied in great detail [16, 17] in the past.\nAt half filling the superconducting state is degenerate with a charge density\nwave state and they are connected by a pseudospin rotation.\nIn order to study the effect of disorder, an inhomogeneous calculation is\nnecessary. We use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field approximation and replace local electron correlation by the local superconducting pairing amplitude \u2206i , at site i (only s-wave pairing considered here). \u2206i = hci\u2191 ci\u2193 i\nand ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 . Assuming hni\u2191 i=hni\u2193 i = hni i/2 we get,\nHef f =\n\nX\n<ij>,\u03c3\n\n(c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + c\u2020j\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u0303i c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3\n\ni\u03c3\n\nX\n\n|Ui |[\u2206i c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020i\u2193 + \u2206\u2217i ci\u2193 ci\u2191 ]\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303i = \u03bc + |Ui |hni i/2 is a site-dependent Hartree shift with hni i =\nP\n\u03c3 hni\u03c3 i. All energies are scaled to t = 1. We use an initial value of the\nchemical potential \u03bc and use different random configurations of Ui to realize\nthe inhomogeneous superconductor. We then compare its tendency of superconductivity with the homogeneous system, that is, Ui = U for all i. For the\ninhomogeneous case we have taken Ui to be uniformly random between two\nspecified values. In all these cases we use the self-consistent diagonalization\nof the Hamiltonian - at every iteration compute the averages at every site,\nrecalculate the Hamiltonian and set out for diagonalization again. When\nthe iterations converge we obtain a self-consistent result as usual and then\ncompute the values of the physical the quantities.\n\n3\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWe take a square lattice of finite size and set up the BdG Hamiltonian. On\nreaching self-consistency, the average electron density, i.e., the average filling,\nis calculated. This is repeated for many initial \u03bc and the results are inverted\nto find the necessary physical quantities for a fixed hni as is customary in\ngrand canonical ensemble (the local inhomogeneity and self-consistent interactions forbid fixing the average electron density). We note that ideally one\nwould expect only topological order in two dimensions. However, this does\nnot apply to mean-field order.\nThe variation of \u2206i with Ui is shown in Fig.1. As expected, the sites\nwith large negative attraction have larger superconducting amplitude. It is\ninteresting to note that although there are sites with strictly zero or very\nsmall |Ui |, there are no sites with zero \u2206i . This is not unexpected, as a\nlarge local fluctuation of order parameter is quite unfavourable with respect\nto quantum fluctuations and are energetically costly in terms of the loss of\ninteraction energy. Such finding have also been reported earlier [8], but we\n\n\fdo not find any value of hUi for which the disordered system has a larger\naverage gap than the uniform case. In the case of a bimodal distribution of\nUi , though, the proximity effect seems to be much stronger and the disordered\nsystem has a larger gap than the uniform one below a certain hUi. We also\nobserved that unless a specific geometry of the disorder is quenched into the\nlattice, there is no possibility of a stripe like state to organize self-consistently\nas observed by Dagotto[8]. We believe in a situation where the disorder is\nannealed and randomly distributed, such highly anisotropic states are quite\nunlikely in the present model.\n\nFigure 1: (Colour online) (a)Variation of the local pairing amplitude \u2206i with\nthe interaction Ui , distributed uniformly in the range 0-4 (b)Comparison\nbetween the variation of < \u2206 > with < U > for uniform and disordered\ncases at < n >= 1, < n >= 0.8 and < n >= 0.6. (c)Variation of <\n\u2206unif orm > / < \u2206disorder >with < U >. (d)Variation of average local pairing\namplitude< \u2206 > with < n >)(e) Superconducting regions for U=0-2. The\nred islands represent superconducting regions with large amplitude (see text).\n\n\fFig. 1a shows that \u2206i increases with Ui and saturates at large Ui , there is\na broad distribution of \u2206i for lower values of Ui . Fluctuation in the pairing\namplitude \u2206i are indeed larger in the weak-coupling region. The variation of\nP\nthe average Ui and the average < \u2206 >= N1 i \u2206i gives a good indication of\ntheir relationship and can be compared with the uniform case. The comparison in Fig.1b shows an enhancement of the average superconducting pairing\namplitude h\u2206i with hUi as expected saturating at a higher value of the attraction. The value of average pairing amplitude is higher for the uniform\ncase than the disorder case for all values of< n >= 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 contrary\nto that of bimodal distribution. Fig. 1c shows the ratio as a function of average interaction, and it rises sharply at low U and always stays above one.\nThis implies that the random disorder inhibits long range superconducting\norder. Fig.1d shows the usual bell-shaped curve of < \u2206 > versus < n > with\nmaximum at < n >= 1.\nIn order to glean the real-space picture of the superconducting regions,\nwe mark the sites where the value of \u2206i is greater than the corresponding\nvalue in the homogeneous case (Fig.1e). Since all sites have non-zero \u2206i , this\nprescription allows us to locate preferred patterns, if any, in the real space.\nWe do not see any such pattern while the regions of strong \u2206i are quite randomly distributed forming patches. The formation of islands in turn reduces\nthe overall observed Tc (which is determined by the phase coupling across\nsuch regions) in a real system and the corresponding superfluid stiffness.\nPlotting the frequency distribution of \u2206i gives a good account of the effects of disorder. The peak in Fig. 2a is certainly above the mean value.\nWith higher disorder the peak shifts towards right. Further on we calculate\nthe pair correlation function (Fig. 2b), defined as c(ri \u2212 rj ) =< \u2206i \u2206j >.\nA disorder averaging is done as usual to restore the translational invariance.\nThe correlation function drops sharply at short distances but saturates at\nlarge distances indicating a true (mean-field) long range order. The correlation function for four ranges of U are shown in Fig. 2b, they all merge to a\nsingle curve (except for small fluctuations due to finite size) when normalized.\n\nFigure 2: (a)Frequency Distribution P(\u2206) of \u2206 for U=0-2 (b)Plot of correlation for four U ranges: 0-2 0-4 0-6 0-8\n\n\fFigure 3: Density of States plot for U=0-2 and 0-4, the two sets of curves\nare offset vertically to make them separate.\nThe presence of a superconducting gap is another indication of the true\nlong range order [9]. It is, therefore, very important to look at the density\nof states (DOS) of the system. As mentioned above there are no sites with\nzero pairing amplitude. This is reflected in the DOS where the gap at zero\nenergy is clearly seen in Fig. 3, while the very sharp peaks (divergences in\na homogeneous superconductor) are now broadened into two symmetrical\nregions with a broad distribution of states at higher and lower energies. The\npresence of the energy gap even in the highly disordered systems clearly\nindicates that s-wave superconductivity is possible even in the presence of\nlarge disorder.\nTo understand the effect of coupling of two disordered superconductors,\nwe take up two such superconductors and join them via a narrow channel\n(Fig. 4f) and observe the effects due to the proximity of each other. We\nfind that contrary to the common expectation the width and length of the\nchannel do not have any significant effect on the superconductivity in either\nsystems (4d,e).More interestingly, results from the comparative variation of\nh\u2206i, hUi, hni of the two blocks (Fig. 4a-e) do not give any clear influence of\nthe channel. For example, we observed the variation of h\u2206i of one superconductor with the hUi in both uniform and disordered case and compared with\nsimilar results of the single block system we had obtained earlier. Results are\nsymmetric with respect to interchange of systems 1 and 2. It is clearly seen\nfrom Fig. 4a that the average superconducting pairing amplitude in blocks\nof the coupled system follow identically the pattern of a single block system\nin both disorder and uniform regime. The channel was kept homogeneous.\nThe results do not change if the channel is maintained homogeneous but non\nsuperconducting (Ui = 0 for all i in the channel).This unexpected behaviour,\nwe believe, is due to the formation of islands of low pairing amplitude discussed earlier (Fig 1e). These regions localize the electron in the block since\nit would be energetically unfavourable for the electrons to percolate through\nthe channel. This inhibits correlations between the blocks,effectively making\n\n\fthem behave as independent systems.\nThe average superconducting pairing amplitude in the second system increases at the expense of h\u22061 i (Fig. 4b since the enhanced attraction in\nsystem 2 provides extra stabilization energy in that region. Note that the\nvariation of < \u22062 > with < U2 > is also unaffected (Fig. 4b) by the presence\nof system 1 and nearly similar to that for a single system. The variations\nof overall average pairing amplitude h\u22061 + \u22062 i with total average interaction at a fixed overall density is shown in Fig. 4c. The combined system\nbehaves like an isolated single system and expectedly shows the typical rise\nand saturation behaviour seen in a single system.\nFig. 4d demonstrates clearly how the average order parameter in the two\nsystems are correlated with the corresponding interactions. The larger the\nattraction, more is the average h\u2206i. As hUi increases in any system, the\ndensity of electrons tends to increase for the extra stabilization available in\nthat region. Fig. 4e shows this tendency, with hni i in each superconductor\nincreasing rapidly with the average attractive interaction there.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied inhomogeneous s-wave superconductors using the Bogoliubov de-Gennes mean-field theory. Superconductivity is suppressed over the homogeneous weak-coupling value due to disorder, though\nthe proximity effect is strong with non-zero pairing amplitude at all sites\n(even with Ui = 0). The frequency distribution of p(\u2206) shows a peak towards\nhigher values of \u2206. The gap in the density of states persists even for the high\ndisordered case lending support to the existence of strongly disordered inhomogeneous superconductivity. When two such blocks of inhomogeneous\nsuperconductors are connected via a channel, there is no appreciable effect\nof one on the other. The individual blocks are not affected significantly by the\nother block connected by the channel . We argue that this is due to the fact\nthat the fluctuating local order parameters remain pinned to the individual\nvalues thereby preventing significant correlation between the blocks.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nBC acknowledges a junior research fellowship from the Council of Scientific\nand Industrial Research, India.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] D.
