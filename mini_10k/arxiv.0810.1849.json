At the electron accelerator ELSA a linearly polarised tagged photon beam is produced by coherent bremsstrahlung off a diamond crystal. Orientation and energy range of the linear polarisation can\nbe deliberately chosen by accurate positioning of the crystal with a goniometer. The degree of polarisation is determined by the form of the scattered electron spectrum. Good agreement between experiment\nand expectations on basis of the experimental conditions is obtained. Polarisation degrees of P\u03b3 = 40%\nare typically achieved at half of the primary electron energy. The determination of P\u03b3 is confirmed by\nmeasuring the beam asymmetry, \u03a3, in \u03c0 0 photoproduction and a comparison of the results to independent\nmeasurements using laser backscattering.\nPACS. 13.60.-r Photon and charged-lepton interactions with hadrons \u2013 13.60.Le Meson production \u2013\n13.88.+e Polarization in interactions and scattering\n\n1 Introduction\nExperiments based on photo-induced exclusive reactions\nare well suited to improve our understanding of the complicated structure of the nucleon.

From linearly polarised\nphotons alone the beam asymmetry, \u03a3, can be extracted\n(for a definition of the observables see e.g. ref. [1]). In case\nof pseudoscalar meson photoproduction the beam asymmetry alone does not allow an unambiguous extraction of\nall partial waves [2], but its measurement is essential in\nview of a complete experiment [3].\nThe two common methods for generation of linearly polarised photons are coherent bremsstrahlung and Compton backscattering (CBS). In Compton backscattering the\nelectron beam collides with a laser beam of short wavelength. Linearly polarised photons can be produced using\nlinearly polarised laser photons [4,5]. The degree of polarisation of the CBS photons is proportional to that of laser\nphotons, with its maximum at the highest photon energy.\n\n\f2\n\nD. Elsner et al.: Linearly polarised photon beams at ELSA\n\nAt the present facilities this method is compared to electron bremsstrahlung limited in intensity and achievable\nmaximum photon energy.\nIn coherent electron bremsstrahlung the recoil is transferred to a crystal radiator. Depending on its orientation\nrelative to the electron beam, the whole crystal absorbs\nthe recoil, which fixes the plane of electron deflection. Consequently, the photons produced by the coherent process\nare linearly polarised. Compared to CBS, photon beams\nfrom coherent bremsstrahlung have a higher intensity, but\non the other hand a lower maximum degree of polarisation\nat higher photon energies.\nSeveral facilities successfully use coherent bremsstrahlung\nto produce linearly polarised photons at high energies [6,\n7]. For the first time a setup for coherent bremsstrahlung\nwas installed and operated at the electron accelerator ELSA\n[8]. The following section is first devoted to the basics of\ncoherent bremsstrahlung. The description of the apparatus is then followed by the alignment procedure for the\ncrystal and the results obtained for the photon polarisation. In sect. 6 the measurement of the photon beamasymmetry, \u03a3, in \u03c0 0 -photoproduction is presented as an\nindependent cross check for the polarisation analysis.\n\n2 Coherent Bremsstrahlung\nRadiators with a periodical lattice structure allow the production of linearly polarised photons via the process of\ncoherent bremsstrahlung. In this section properties of the\ncoherent process are described which are essential for the\nunderstanding of the experimental methods. For a more\ndetailed discussion we refer to review articles [9\u201314].\nIn the case of incoherent bremsstrahlung (bs), an electron\nwith energy E0 and momentum p0 radiates a photon with\nenergy k, due to coulomb interaction. Momentum conservation requires a recoil partner to take over the recoil momentum\nq = p0 \u2212 p \u2212 k.\n\n(1)\n\nHere p denotes the momentum of the outgoing electron. In\ngeneral, a kinematical constraint applies for the longitudinal, ql , and transversal, qt , momentum transfer. A good\napproximation for this so-called \"pancake\" condition [13,\n14] is given by the relations\n\u03b4 \u2264 ql \u2264 2\u03b4\n0 \u2264 qt \u2264 2x.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe longitudinal momentum transfer shows a non-zero\nlower limit given by\n\u03b4(x) \u2261: qlmin =\n\nx\n1\n,\n2E0 1 \u2212 x\n\n(4)\n\nwith the fractional photon energy x = k/E0 .\nIn the case of incoherent bs only one single nucleus\n(or electron) absorbs the momentum transfer, in contrast\nto the coherent process where the whole lattice participates, comparable to the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer effect. The process of\n\nFig. 1. Left: Projection of four parallel planes through the reciprocal lattice vectors [000], [001], [002] and [003] in the plane\nb1 , b2 . The primary momentum p0 is rotated by a small angle\n\u03b8. The pancake region is indicated by a grey band. With regard\nto the b3 -axis, perpendicular to the drawing plane, many vectors still lie in the allowed kinematical region (circle). Right:\nReciprocal lattice vectors in the plane b2 , b3 . Compared to the\nleft picture the angle \u03b8 is larger and p0 is tilted out of the plane\nb1 , b2 by the angle \u03b1, such that only the vector [022] lies in\nkinematical allowed region.\n\ncoherent bs depends decisively on the orientation of the\nmomentum transfer q in the reciprocal lattice space, more\nprecisely, the momentum transfer has to fit to a vector of\nthe reciprocal lattice. Consequently, only discrete recoil\nmomenta can be transferred to the crystal as a whole,\nspecified by the Laue condition\nq = n * g.\n\n(5)\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector\ng=\n\n3\nX\n\nhk bk\n\n(6)\n\nk=1\n\nis composed of the Miller indices, hk , and the basis vectors\nof the reciprocal lattice, bk (below we use the nomenclature [h1 h2 h3 ]). Figure 1 shows the momentum vector p0\nin the reciprocal lattice space. For the selection of only\none reciprocal lattice vector in the kinematical region of\nallowed recoils the angles \u03b8 in the plane b1 b2 and \u03b1 in\nthe plane b2 b3 have to be carefully chosen. The pancake\nregion is illustrated by the grey band perpendicular to the\nmomentum vector p0 .\nContributions to the coherent bs cross section only result from reciprocal lattice vectors within the pancake region. At a fixed orientation of the lattice, the pancake\nshifts with increasing photon energy, cf. eq. 4. Consequently, at a certain point a reciprocal lattice vector leaves\nthe pancake. This leads to a discontinuity in the coherent\nbs intensity at the fractional photon energy\nxd =\n\n2E0 \u03b4\n.\n(1 + 2E0 \u03b4)\n\n(7)\n\nThe plane of the electron deflection is fixed very tightly\nby the incoming electron momentum p0 and the reciprocal lattice vector g responsible for the coherent process.\nHence, the linear polarisation of the emitted photons is\noriented in the plane (g, p0 ).\n\n\fD. Elsner et al.: Linearly polarised photon beams at ELSA\n\nFig. 2. Goniometer setup for the Crystal-Barrel/TAPS experiment at ELSA. Left: Available amorphous radiators which can\nbe selected by rotation of the azimuthal axis. The horizontal\ntranslation allows the choice of either crystal or amorphous radiator. Right: Three step-motor drives may be used to rotate\nthe crystal around a vertical axis (\u03b8vlab ), a horizontal axis (\u03b8hlab )\nand an azimuthal axis (\u03c6lab ). The diamond crystal is mounted\nin the center of the three axes with its [100] crystal axis parallel to the goniometer axis (\u03c6lab ). The remaining two axes allow\nthe horizontal and vertical translation.\n\n3 Apparatus\nThe electron beam of ELSA [8] hits the radiator target in\nfront of the tagging system [15]. Electron beams of E0 =\n2.4 GeV and E0 = 3.2 GeV were routinely used for experiments with linearly polarised photons.\nThe crystal has a front surface of (4 x 4) mm and thickness\nof 500 \u03bcm. It is accurately positioned by a dedicated commercial 5-axis goniometer1. The maximum angular uncertainty is \u03b4 < 170 \u03bcrad due to the wobble along the axes.\nOptical test measurements showed that other uncertainties, like absolute accuracy, uni-directional repeatability\nand reversal value (hysteresis) are negligible. The crystal, glued on a 12.5 \u03bcm kapton foil, is positioned in the\ncommon center of the three rotation axes of the goniometer, horizontal (\u03b8hlab ), vertical (\u03b8vlab ) and azimuthal (\u03c6lab ),\ncf. fig. 2. The minimum incremental motion (the smallest increment of motion the device is capable of consistently and reliably delivering) of each rotation axes is \u03b8\n= 0.001 degree. Special measurements, discussed in sect.\n4, confirm the orientation of the [100] crystal axis perpendicular to its front surface.\nFurther copper radiators with different thicknesses and\nwires to scan size and position of the electron beam are\nmounted on a disk around the crystal, as can be seen in\nfig. 2.\nElectrons which radiated a photon are momentum analysed using the tagging-spectrometer, as schematically depicted in fig. 3. The detection system consists of 14 plastic scintillators providing fast timing and additional hodoscopes, a 480 channel scintillating fibre detector and a\nMWPC, to achieve a good energy resolution. The optimisation and analysis of linear polarisation is solely based on\nthe data of the scintillating fibre detector which covers the\nenergy range E\u03b3 = 0.18...0.8 E0. The fibres are arranged\n1\n\nNewport Corporation, Irvine, CA 92606, USA\n\n3\n\nin two layers. The individual fibres overlap by around 2/3\nof their diameter. The energy resolution varies between\n2 MeV for the high photon energies and 25 MeV for the\nlow energies for E0 = 3.2 GeV. The tagged photon beam\nremains virtually uncollimated. Hence, the measured electron spectrum directly reflects the photon spectrum. The\norientation of the linear polarisation and the position of\nthe coherent maximum in the photon energy-spectrum depends on the alignment of the crystal relative to the electron beam direction. Maximum polarisation is found in\nthe plane (g, p0 ). The direction of the momentum vector\np0 in the reference frame of the crystal is defined by the\npolar angle, \u03b8, and the azimuthal angle, \u03b1, cf. fig. 1. The\nangle \u03c6 is the azimuth of the reciprocal lattice vector g\nin the same reference frame.

It is essential to\ndetermine all angular offsets between the crystal reference\nframe and the goniometer system on the one hand, and\nthe incoming electron beam and the goniometer system on\nthe other hand with sufficient accuracy. The former offsets\nhave to be measured once in case of a fixed installation.\nThe latter depend on the stability of the beam alignment\nand have to be determined repeatedly. For the alignment\nprocess we use the coherent bremsstrahlung itself as described in the next section.\n\nFig. 3. Setup of the tagging-system as described in the text.\n\n\f4\n\nD.

The structures rotated by 45 degrees result from the\n[044] and [044] vectors and give additional interpolation points\n.\n\n4 Crystal alignment - Stonehenge Technique\nThe alignment is achieved by the Stonehenge Technique.\nThe procedure can cope with a relatively large mounting\nmisalignment and allows any arbitrary orientation of the\npolarisation plane to be selected. A detailed description\nis given in [16,17]. The basis of the technique is a quasi\nazimuthal scan which sweeps the crystal axes in a cone\nof angular radius \u03b8c by stepping simultaneously on the\nhorizontal and vertical axis of rotation:\n\u03b8vlab = \u03b8c cos \u03a6;\n\u03b8hlab\n\n= \u03b8c sin \u03a6.\n\n0 \u2264 \u03a6 < 2\u03c0\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nFor each point of the scan a photon energy spectrum\nis measured and plotted in a polar diagram (Stonehenge\nplot), where the photon energy increases in the outward\nradial direction and the x- and y-directions correspond to\nthe rotation axes \u03b8vlab and \u03b8hlab , respectively. In order to accentuate the coherence effect, the spectra are normalised\nto the spectrum of an amorphous copper radiator. Therefore the colour code of the diagram denotes the coherent intensity. A Stonehenge plot for a non aligned crystal taken for the Crystal-Barrel/TAPS experiment [2] is\nshown in fig. 4. The coherent contributions from different\nsettings of crystal planes result in pronounced structures\ndue to the different angles between crystal and electron\nbeam. The strongest intensities typically relate to the [022]\nand [022] reciprocal lattice vectors and the points where\nthey converge at E\u03b3 \u2192 0 (inner circle) indicate where the\ncorresponding setting of planes is parallel to the electron\n\nFig. 5. Stonehenge plot for perfect aligned crystal at\nE0 =3.2 GeV, cf. fig. 4. Here the opening cone of the quasi\nazimuthal scan is \u03b8c = 10 mrad. Photon energy spectra for\nthree different \u03c6-angles are plotted additionally to illustrate\nthe shifting of the coherent peak.\n\nbeam. The analysis of the symmetry in the Stonehenge\nplots yields all independent offsets of the crystal. For a\ndetailed description of this analysis method it is referred\nto [16,17].\nTaking into account the angular offsets, it is possible to set\nthe linear polarisation at any desired spatial direction and\nat any photon energy by choosing the crystal orientation.\nFigure 5 shows the Stonehenge plot of a perfectly aligned\ncrystal with a vertical orientation of the [022] plane. Three\none-dimensional sample histograms for different directions\nare shown on the right side. The precision of the angular\noffsets depends on scan parameters, basically the step size\nand the cone \u03b8c (cf. eq. 15). The resulting azimuthal orientation has an accuracy of \u2206\u03c6 = 0.5 degree [17].\nIn order to preserve the alignment during the experiment,\nthe stability of the beam position is monitored online, using the coherent peak itself, since the position of the coherent peak in the energy spectrum is extremely sensitive\nto angle of the incident beam. As for the Stonehenge plots,\nalso for beam diagnostics the coherent spectrum is always\nnormalised to the spectrum of an amorphous copper radiator. At the beginning of each experiment a normalised\nreference histogram is defined, which is compared with\nthe online spectrum permanently. The incoherent copper\nspectrum is measured in regular intervals.\n\n5 Degree of linear polarisation\nThe generation of high degrees of linear polarisation requires the isolated contribution of one of the [0,\u00b12,\u00b12,]\nreciprocal lattice vectors to coherent bremsstrahlung. Precisely determined offsets (cf. sect. 4) enable to deliberately set both, the energy of the coherent peak and the\norientation of the linear polarisation. The determination\n\n\fD.

Comparison of the polarisation contribution of the\n[044] vector, with its maximum at E\u03b3 =1900MeV, underneath\nthe selected [022] vector at E\u03b3 =1300MeV. The curve with the\nbroadened peaks shows the effect of typical experimental conditions, basically multiple scattering and electron-beam divergence.\n\nof the polarisation degree is based on the comparison of\nthe measured electron spectrum with the ANB (\"analytic\nbremsstrahlung calculation\") software [19] from T\u00fcbingen\nUniversity. The ANB code allows the calculation of coherent intensities for each single reciprocal lattice vector. It\nintegrates over all desired vectors. Taking into account the\nincoherent contributions, the degree of polarisation can be\ndetermined. If there is no overlap of different reciprocal\nlattice vectors within a given energy interval, the degree\nof polarisation can be obtained from any fit of the intensity spectrum.\nFigure 6 shows the ANB-calculated relative photon intensity spectrum along with the calculated photon polarisation. Due to a tiny overlap with the adjacent peak of the\n[044] vector the exact determination of the polarisation\ndegree from the experimental data alone is not feasible.\nIn our particular case no clear separation of the vector\n[022] was realisable in the required energy region.\nUnder given experimental conditions the shape of the\ncoherent spectrum is not determined by the crystal orientation alone. Each single process has a small deviation\nfrom the nominal kinematics as a result of beam divergence and multiple scattering in the crystal. Both effects\ncause a smearing of the sharp edge at the discontinuity\nposition, due to the different pancake conditions for individual processes, and hence lower the intensity and consequently the maximum degree of polarisation (cf. fig. 6).\nThe effects of beam divergence, beam spot-size, energy resolution and multiple scattering are included in the ANB\nsoftware. Tables 1-3 show overviews of typical values for\nour experimental parameters. The electron-beam energy\nand the spot size are precisely measured. The values of\nthe beam divergence result from calculations of the beamline optic.\n\nE\u03b3 (Pmax. )/MeV\n1305\n1515\n1610\n1814\n\nPmax.\n0.49\n0.42\n0.39\n0.31\n\n\u03b8hcry /mrad\n-3.16\n-4.09\n-4.58\n-5.88\n\n\u03b8vcry /mrad\n-56.78\n-64.00\n67.00\n76.00\n\nTable 3. Coherent peak position, maximum degree of polarisation, P max. , and crystal angles for the vertical orientation of the polarisation plane.\n\nAdditionally, collimation affects the degree of polarisation,\ndue to the different angular distribution for the coherent\nand incoherent bs. However, no effective collimation of the\nphoton beam was used in the experimental.\nDuring the first round of CBELSA/TAPS data taking at\nELSA four different crystal settings were used, with maximum polarisation at E\u03b3 =1305 MeV, 1515 MeV, 1610 MeV\nand 1814 MeV. Vertical orientation of the polarisation vector was chosen, since the vertical divergence of the ELSA\nelectron beam is about an order of magnitude smaller than\nin horizontal direction. Normalised electron spectra are\nshown in fig. 7. The curves represent a calculation using\nan improved version [22] of the original ANB software. The\ndescription of the measured intensity spectrum is very accurate at all settings. Two main improvements in the ANB\ncode were necessary to obtain this level of agreement between calculation and experimental data. The inclusion of\nmultiple scattering was improved by a more precise approximation of the angular distribution [23]. The original\ndescription [24] only accounts for the first order of the series expansion of the scattering angle in Moli\u00e8re theory.\nThis accuracy was not sufficient to describe the experimental spectrum. As a consequence a discrepancy appears\nin the steep edge of the coherent peak.\nFurthermore, the incoherent description of the ANB software needs to be scaled for all calculations by a factor of\n1.35 (cf. table 2). This was traced back to an uncertainty\nin the parametrisation of the atomic form factor. A scaling\nof the atomic form factor according to Cromer and Waber\n[18] by a factor of 1.1 yields the same result, as the scaling of the incoherent part. Taking into account the formfactor parametrisation after Schiff [20], the difference of\nthe form factors is also a factor of 1.1. Consequently, the\ntwo alternative parametrisations provide an uncertainty\nin the order of 10% in the required momentum-transfer\nregion.

The measured coherent bremsstrahlung intensity normalised to an incoherent spectrum in comparison to an improved\nversion [22] of the ANB-calculation [19] (full curve).

The numbered blocks\nindicate the ranges covered by the 14 timing scintillators of the tagging detector.\n\ncontributions determine the absolute value of linear polarisation. In this respect the re-scaling of the incoherent\ncontributions introduces no significant additional error.\nAn absolute error of \u03b4P\u03b3 < 0.02 is estimated using variations of the calculated relative intensity by \u00b15%. These\nworst-case estimate accounts for deviations from the shape\nof the spectrum due to combined statistical and systematical effects.\nAssigning the appropriate photon energy to each single\nevent in the data analysis yields the event-weighted average polarisation in each bin of photon energy. An independent cross check of the determination of the polarisation degree is the measurement of the photon beamasymmetry, \u03a3, in an energy region were it is well known\nfrom other independent measurements. This is discussed\nin the next section.\n\n6 Beam asymmetry in \u03c0 0 photoproduction\nThe analysis of the photon beam-asymmetry, \u03a3, in the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 0 provides a well suited consistency check\nfor the determination of the degree of polarisation. Large\n\nphoton asymmetries are involved, especially at small angles \u03b8\u03c0cm\n0 , and a zero-crossing at certain energies. Comparing our results to earlier measurements at GRAAL2\n[5] gives an independent check, in particular because at\nGRAAL linearly polarised photon beams are produced\nby a different process, laser backscattering, with a well\ndefined and high degree of polarisation. Our results are\nbased on the same data set and data analysis presented in\na previous publication on the beam asymmetry in \u03b7 photoproduction [2]. The experimental setup and the main\nsteps of the data analysis are shortly summarised in the\nfollowing.\n\n6.1 Experimental setup and data analysis\nThe linearly polarised photon beam from the tagging system (cf. Sec. 3) was incident on a 5.3 cm long liquid hydrogen target. The target is surrounded by a cylindrical,\nthree layer scintillating fibre detector, covering the polar\nangular range from 15 to 168 degrees, and the Crystal\nBarrel (CB) detector [25], consisting of 1290 individual\n2\n\nGRenoble Anneau Accelerateur Laser\n\n\fD.

Note the logarithmic scale.\n\n(17)\n\nthe product of beam asymmetry and photon polarisation,\nP\u03b3 \u03a3, is given by the ratio B/A in each bin of photon energy and pion angle, \u03b8\u03c0cm\n0 . Finally, the event-weighted average polarisation, assigned as described in Sec. 5, allows\nthe determination of \u03a3 in each data bin.\n6.2 Results\n\nCsI(Tl) crystals covering a polar angular range of 30 -\n168 degrees. The forward cone of 5.8 - 30 degree was covered by the TAPS detector, a setup of 528 BaF2 modules\nat a distance of 118.7 cm from the target. Charged particle recognition is obtained by the hit information from\nthe plastic-scintillator modules in front of TAPS and the\nscintillating fibre detector inside CB. The first level trigger was derived from the TAPS detector modules, which\nare individually equipped with photomultiplier readout.\nTwo alternative trigger conditions were used, either \u2265 2\nhits above a low threshold (A) or \u2265 1 hit above a high\nthreshold (B). Within \u2243 10 \u03bcs, a fast cluster recognition\nfor the Crystal Barrel provides the second level trigger\n(C). Finally, the total trigger condition required 2 clusters\nidentified: [A \u2228 (B \u2227 C)].\nThe offline analysis is based on three detector hits, corresponding to two photons from the pion decay, and the\nproton. A photon hit is usually composed of a cluster of\nadjacent crystals whose energy is summed over. Due to the\ndetection of the proton, the kinematics is overdetermined.\nThe analysis starts with all combinatorial possibilities, i.e.\n3 for the 3\u2013cluster events. No charged particle identification for the proton was used to avoid false azimuthal\ndistributions due to inefficiencies of the veto detectors.\nFurthermore, only the angular information of the proton\ncandidate was used. The energy of the proton candidate\nwas disregarded.\nKinematic cuts, based on longitudinal and transverse momentum conservation, are used to extract the desired reaction. Additionally, a cut on the missing mass was applied\nto the proton candidates (mp \u00b1 150MeV). Figure 8 shows\nthe two-photon invariant mass distribution [2] obtained.\nBelow the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 peaks the overall background is very\nsmall (note the logarithmic scale). After background subtraction a clean event sample was obtained from cuts of\n\nFigure 9 shows the results for the beam asymmetry extracted for one crystal setting with a maximum degree of\npolarisation at E\u03b3 = 1305 MeV. Statistical errors are directly attached to the data points. The bars indicate the\nestimated total systematic uncertainty. The major contribution to the systematic error of this experiment stems\nfrom angle-dependent inefficiencies [22]. Data within the\nrange \u03b8\u03c0cm\n0 = 60 \u2013 100 degree are missing due to the trigger\ncondition B, which was used to select events with higher\nphoton multiplicity than \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3. In fig. 9 our data are\ncompared to data of the GRAAL collaboration [5]. Both\ndata sets show a very good agreement, despite small fluctuations around \u03b8\u03c0cm\n0 = 115 degree. The kinematics of these\ndata points are correlated to a very low proton energy,\nprobably the protons got stuck in the \u03c6-unsymmetrical\nholding structure of the inner detector. This \u03c6-dependence\nof detection efficiency affects directly the experimental\nasymmetry.\nFigure 9 also shows the good agreement between both\ndata sets and two standard calculations, the Mainz isobar model MAID [28] and the Bonn\u2013Gatchina partial wave\nanalysis BnGa [29].\nAn explicit deviation of both data sets is shown in fig. 10.\nThe difference of the absolute values of the beam asymmetries (|\u03a3CB | \u2212 |\u03a3GRAAL |) is plotted in one histogram.\nThis representation is more sensitive to an incorrect measurement of the photon polarisation than the difference of\nthe signed values. In fig. 10 the mean value of a gauss distribution is compatible with zero. Also the width (sigma)\ncorresponds to our mean statistical error. Consequently\nthis cross check shows no indications for an additional\ncontribution to the systematic error in the determination\nof the degree of polarisation. Hence we conclude that the\nabsolute determination of the degree of linear polarisation\n\n\f8\n\nD. Elsner et al.: Linearly polarised photon beams at ELSA\n\n0\nFig. 9.

Within the photon energy range E\u03b3 = 800...1400 MeV we achieve polarisation\ndegrees up to 49 %. At higher energies the polarisation reduces to e.g. P\u03b3 \u2248 30% at E\u03b3 = 1800 MeV. The precise orientation of the diamond crystal versus the incoming electron beam is essential. It is realised by a 5-axis goniometer. The alignment is based on the Stonehenge Technique.\nBoth, the relative intensity spectrum and the polarisation\ndegree, have been calculated with an improved version of\nthe ANB software.\nAn independent consistency check is provided by the measurement of the photon beam asymmetry, \u03a3, in the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 0 .
