In some cases, this simply\nmeans ensuring that people have a correct understanding of\nyour actions, while in other cases it may involve giving a\nmisleading impression by telling a \"white lie.\"\n\nAllison Woodruff\nIntel Research Berkeley\n2150 Shattuck Avenue, Suite 1300\nBerkeley, CA 94704-1347 USA\nFor example, imagine that you called your friend two\nweeks ago and left a message asking them to call you back,\nbut they did not. Based on previous events in your\nrelationship, you account for this failure as likely being due\nto a busy schedule as opposed to a personal issue. You\nlater run into your friend at a party. Your friend,\napparently concerned that you will feel you have been\nrebuffed, says, \"I'm sorry I didn't call you back. I've been\nout of town.\" Now, you may or may not believe your\nfriend is telling the truth. However, in either case you are\nlikely to give the impression that you accept your friend's\nstory and move on, saying something like, \"That's all right.\nI just wanted to ask you for Mary's phone number.\" By\ntaking this action, you are helping to maintain harmony,\njust as your friend was helping to maintain harmony by\noffering an explanation. You and your friend have now\nreached a \"working consensus\" [15] on a story that allows\nyou to proceed without direct confrontation \u2013 your friend is\nnot directly confronted with the suggestion that they were\nnegligent or untruthful, and you are not directly confronted\nwith the suggestion that you have been rebuffed.\nWireless personal communication systems can easily\nmultiply the complexity of such situations, increasing the\ndaily burden of face-work. Because the devices are both\nportable and personal, people who initiate contact can gain\nincreased insight into one's activities, often achieving\naccess to domains (home, work, friends,...) that one might\notherwise try to keep separate [28]. More importantly, the\ndevices support a growing number of lightweight\ncommunication services \u2013 text messaging, mobile instant\nmessaging, push-to-talk audio messaging, etc. \u2013 and\nthereby enable remote interactions to occur on an\nincreasingly spontaneous basis (see, e.g., [25]). Many\ncommunicative acts have implications for the status of a\nrelationship (providing contact information [25], accepting\na call [24], replying promptly [22,23], using appropriate\nlanguage [33]), making each lightweight interaction an\nopportunity for a problematic event.\nRecognizing this, we suggest that the design of personal\ncommunication systems can be reconceptualized in a way\nthat helps designers in addressing these issues. Rather than\nsimply looking at novel personal communication systems\nin terms of their effectiveness in transmitting information,\nwe also need to consider their designs in terms of how they\naddress users' overall social needs. A key observation is\n\n\fthat more interpersonal knowledge often makes relationship\nmanagement harder \u2013 sociologists have long argued that\n\"[r]elationships...presuppose a certain ignorance and a\nmeasure of mutual concealment\" [32] to function smoothly.\n(In the scenario above, suppose you had perfect\ninformation about your friend's movements. If your friend\nwere aware of this, they would be restricted to stories that\nwere consistent with that information; if not, and they told\na \"white lie,\" they would be caught.) We might, then, think\nof evaluating designs in terms of their support for creating\npersonal space through ambiguity, a goal that may have to\nbe traded off against the goal of clarity that we usually\nassociate with communication systems.\nA central theme of this paper is that, while participants in\ninteraction always observe and account for the actions of\nothers, it is not always desirable for all parties to be able to\naccount accurately and precisely. The communication\nsystem, through its design, can provide resources for\nparticipants to create ambiguity in their interactions.1\n(Here, and throughout this paper, we use ambiguity in its\nsense of \"admitting of multiple interpretations.\") Put\nanother way, rather than trying to provide perfect\ninformation to eliminate ambiguity, the designer can try to\npreserve enough space for the stories that make up the\nworking consensus of successful face-work.\nIn this paper, we illustrate some ways in which users\nexploit properties of personal communication technologies\n\u2013 not necessarily consciously \u2013 to create ambiguity. In\nparticular, we focus on how people handle two variations of\nunresponsiveness in interaction: when people fail to\nrespond to others' conversation, or when people fail to\nreciprocate others' attempts to establish mutual access in a\ncommunication medium. In part, we draw upon examples\nfrom research literature in mediated communication\ntechnologies. However, we mainly discuss implications of\nour own fieldwork and design experience with a mobile\naudio communication system (described in part in [2,37]).\nAMBIGUITY AND MEDIATION\n\nParticipants in social interaction attempt to account for\nothers' behavior and to make their own behavior\naccountable to others; participants continually form\nmeaning from what others say and do, combining this with\ncontext such as recent utterances and occurrences, personal\nknowledge, cultural norms, etc. [12]. In this section, we\ndiscuss two main ways in which mediation can affect how\npeople account for each other's behavior. First, we discuss\n\"passive effects\" \u2013 effects that are natural results of the fact\nthat mediated communication passes through a channel and\nis therefore less direct than face-to-face communication.\nSecond, we discuss \"active effects\" \u2013 effects that result\nfrom explicit efforts to manage the perception of\n1\n\nWhile there are some shared motivations and techniques for the\npreservation of ambiguity and the preservation of privacy, this proposition\nis not the same as simply saying that designers must consider privacy\nissues; see the discussion in the later section on \"Ambiguity in Design.\"\n\nparticipants.\nBecause much previous literature has\ndiscussed the attempts of humans to influence how other\nhumans account for their actions, in this discussion of\nactive effects, we focus on features in the communication\nsystem that are intentionally designed to influence how one\nparticipant accounts for actions of another.\nBefore launching into the discussion of technological\naspects, we need to expand upon the relationship between\nambiguity and accounting. For a variety of reasons,\nparticipants in social interaction cope with substantial\nambiguity even in the most ordinary face-to-face\nencounters. Sometimes, participants deliberately make\ntheir actions ambiguous. They may also increase the\nlikelihood of misunderstanding by inadvertently failing to\nprovide enough information about some specific subject.\nHowever, the reason why ambiguity is pervasive in\ninteraction is that interaction is full of unstated \"commonsense\" assumptions that are based on context: participants\n\"just know\" how they should behave in public and at home,\nwhat kinds of behavior are polite and rude, and so on, and\nexpect others to have analogous knowledge of how to act\n[12]. Therefore, each participant accounts for others'\nactions on a continual basis as the interaction unfolds. In\nshort, any discussion of ambiguity in interaction must\nconsider how people account. 2\nPassive Effects of Mediation\n\nIn this subsection, we describe a framework for thinking\nabout how passive aspects of personal communication\ntechnology affect the way in which people account. This\nframework is intended to be illustrative rather than original,\ncomprehensive or predictive; although it approximates the\ncommon assumptions of a variety of writings in social\npsychology and sociology, it is not derived from or justified\nby a particular theory.\nConsider two people, A and B. In face-to-face interaction\n(Figure 1, top), person A's actions and their subsequent\nresults, if any, are directly observable by person B. While\nperson A's intent remains ambiguous and must be inferred\n(since intent cannot be observed), person B has relatively\nlittle doubt as to what was done. By contrast, in interaction\nthrough a mediated communication system (Figure 1,\ncenter and bottom), person A's actions are generally not\ndirectly observable, a fact represented here by the\nmetaphorical barrier between A and B. Therefore, in the\nmediated case person B must make inferences about person\nA's actions as well as inferences about person A's intent.\nIf the mediating technology is very simple (or very wellunderstood by person B), there may only be a trivially\n2\n\nGarfinkel generally uses \"account\" as a noun, to mean a description that\nserves to lead others to see that one's actions make sense in context. In\ninteraction, one strives to make one's actions \"account-able\" at all times \u2013\nall parties should have an idea of what each of the others is saying and\nwhy. Our use of \"account\" as a verb is an attempt to capture this implicit\nmulti-sided notion \u2013 if one is constructing accounts of one's actions for\nothers, it must be true that the others continually account for one's actions.\n\n\fintent\n\naction\n\nobserved\nresult\ntalk\n\ncancel\n\ndisconnect\n\nreduce\nbandwidth\ncancel\n\ndisconnect\n\nturn off\n\nFigure 1. Informal examples of ambiguity resulting from\nmediation and from multiple possible actors/actions.\n\nsmall number of plausible actions that explain what person\nB is observing (Figure 1, center). In this case, B's\nobservation-action inference is easy. For example, say A\nand B are communicating by telephone (using an ideal\nservice with reliable connectivity). If the connection is\nsuddenly cut off, B can infer that A has taken some\ndeliberate action to end the call; B can then use this\nassumption to make further inferences about A's intent.\nIn more complex, \"intelligent\" forms of mediated\ncommunication in which an autonomous device may act on\nthe user's behalf (Figure 1, bottom), not only is the exact\naction that resulted in the observed result unclear, but it\nmay not even be clear which actor initiated the action.\nPerson A's intent is doubly hidden from person B by a\nmultiplicity of possible actions and possible actors. For\nexample, say A and B have established an open audio\nchannel (again, using an ideal service). If the open channel\ncloses, person B cannot tell if (e.g.) the audio stream was\nterminated by software to reduce bandwidth consumption,\nthe channel was deliberately selected for cancellation, or\nthe handset itself was switched off. Person B also cannot\nconclude whether person A or their device took an action.\nTo summarize, it is harder for observers to tie observed\nresults or actions to personal intentions and dispositions if\nthere are many possible explanations. As mentioned above,\nthis general idea comes up in many theories in various\nfields. For example, consider attribution theory in social\npsychology: \"An action is seen as corresponding to a\nparticular intention to the extent that other possible reasons\nfor the action can be 'discounted'...the fewer unique\neffects the chosen behavior has, the less ambiguous it is\njust which effect the actor intended\" [7]. However, similar\nideas can also found elsewhere (e.g., in sociology, one can\nconsider [12,15,31]; in linguistics, [5]). We need not \"buy\ninto\" attribution theory, ethnomethodology, or other\nspecific theories to be able to reason about these processes.\n\nActive Effects of Mediation\n\nOf course, the effect of mediated communication on\naccounting is not limited to that of the structure of the\ncommunication channel. Participants take an active role,\ngoing beyond observing and accounting for others'\nbehavior \u2013 they try to influence how others are accounting\nfor their own actions. Furthermore, the communication\nsystem itself can provide features that influence how\nparticipants account for each other's actions. The former\ntopic is the subject of much social science research, so here\nwe will restrict our attention to the latter topic.\nThere are two main strategies that have been used in\ncommunication systems in the past to alter information to\nreduce the degree to which people can make inferences\nfrom it. First, the communication system can change the\nprecision of information. Omitting the information entirely\nis an extreme form of this strategy. However, one can be\nmore selective, altering only particular aspects of the\ninformation; for example, if one does not want people to be\nidentifiable in a video stream, one can selectively blur\nportions of the video images. Second, the communication\nsystem can change the accuracy of information. Falsifying\nthe information entirely is an extreme form of this strategy.\nReduced accuracy is not unthinkable in social interaction,\nas prevention of undesired inferences often involves\ndeception of some kind, even between friends [8].\nProducts exist that are solely intended to actively mislead\nothers about illicit behavior (e.g., recordings of background\nsounds to fake one's \"surroundings\" in phone calls [10]).\nHowever, ambiguity, being about meaning, is a social\nconstruction and a designer of a mediated communication\nsystem can go farther than just processing particular data\ntypes or data streams according to the right set of rules.\nThe point is that appropriate degrees of ambiguity can be\nprovided through careful design. The idea is not merely to\ntry to hide the truth, or to try to convince someone of an\nuntruth, but rather to multiply the possible situations so that\nnegative formulations can be avoided if mutually desired.\nDESIGN CASES\n\nThe previous sections have left open the question of how\nwe can design lightweight communication systems to\nprovide appropriate resources for interactional ambiguity.\nRather than trying to consider all relevant resources and\npossible designs, we will instead focus on the uses of\nambiguity to facilitate the ability of users to be\ninteractionally unresponsive. In this section, we first\nexplain the problem and its importance. We then work\nthrough two illustrative design cases. The first case\nillustrates how empirical methods can be applied to assess\nthe use of ambiguity in a communication system; as such, it\nis based primarily on an analysis of fieldwork of users\nusing an existing commercial communication system, and it\ngives a relatively simple and grounded example of how a\nparticular design succeeds in providing an appropriate kind\nof ambiguity. The second case is more complex and\ntheoretical, illustrating how one might move forward from\n\n\fempirically-grounded insights and apply them in the design\nprocess.\nMotivated by fieldwork findings from the\nliterature, we describe a design technique that facilitates a\ndifferent kind of ambiguity and work out two design\nscenarios for concreteness.\nUnresponsiveness has been largely unaddressed in previous\nwork: research in lightweight communication systems has\ntended to focus on designs that allow interactions to begin\nwith greater spontaneity, rather than on facilitating the\nability to avoid, pause, or escape interactions as needed.\nHowever, many situations exist in which it is desirable to\ndelay or avoid communication. People are constantly\nbalancing demands on their attention. Even in face-to-face\ninteraction, balancing the attentional demands of co-present\nparties and tasks can be difficult. The challenge is much\ngreater as mobile technologies make communication with\nremote parties more pervasive.\nThe fundamental problem with unresponsiveness, however,\nis that interaction is an affirmation of a social relationship\nas well as communication [15]. For this reason, the closing\nsequence [30] of a telephone call between people with an\nestablished relationship often involves an affirmation that\nthey will talk again (and perhaps even when this will\nhappen). Consequently, a simple lapse contains an element\nof social insensitivity. Even in co-presence, an abrupt lapse\nin talk is a social signal (usually of rudeness) when it\noccurs between people who are not well-attuned to each\nothers' behavior.\nOur goal in this section, then, is to discuss how\ninteractional unresponsiveness can be facilitated through\nappropriate ambiguity. We describe this at two levels. The\nfirst is the conversational level, i.e., managing\nresponsiveness within a single interaction. (We use\n\"conversational\" in a loose, colloquial sense, meaning only\na sequence of communications \u2013 textual messages, turns at\ntalk, etc. \u2013 that are responsive.) At this level, we assume\nthat users have the ability to reach each other in a given\nmedium, and we consider how particular types of\nambiguity may support delayed responses or spontaneous\nlapses in conversation. The second level is associational or\nrelational, i.e., managing communicative access with\nothers. At this level, users establish boundaries regarding\nwho can contact (\"associate\" with) them in a given\nmedium. For example, users make decisions about to\nwhom they will give their telephone number.\nIn terms of the relationship between the conversational\nlevel and the associational level, one may broadly consider\nthat conversational is within an interaction (or sequence of\ninteractions) in a medium, while associational determines\nwhether that interaction can occur. Our goal is to consider\ndesigns that support stories at both levels.\nCase I: Conversational Ambiguity and Push-to-Talk\n\nAs\njust\nmentioned,\nunexplained\nincidents\nof\nunresponsiveness in face-to-face interaction and real-time\n\nmediated communication tend to have negative social\nimplications. For example, when communicating through a\nfull-duplex audio connection, such as a telephone call or an\nopen audio channel, people generally feel they must\nrespond promptly when someone speaks to them (see, e.g.,\n[1]). However, this is not true to the same degree in all\nforms of mediated communication. In this subsection\n(which expands substantially on a brief discussion in [37]),\nwe discuss our experience with push-to-talk audio provided\nby cellular radios. Observed conversation in push-to-talk\naudio contained delayed responses. We first discuss the\nphenomenon of response delays and then discuss how they\nwere related to ambiguity. We then relate this discussion to\nprevious studies of other mediated communication\ntechnologies to try to separate design issues from the\nparticulars of the specific technologies.\nRelease from Responsiveness\n\nThese findings are based on a study conducted in June 2002\n[37]. We provided a close-knit social group of seven\ncollege students with cellular radios and observed and\ninterviewed them regarding their use of the technology.\nCellular radio service is push-to-talk, similar to walkietalkies or other radio services (however, it is provided\nthrough a cellular network rather than through direct radio\nsignaling). A number of factors distinguish push-to-talk\ninteraction from telephone interaction. Most relevant to\nour discussion is the fact that audio is only transmitted by a\nparticipant when they take the explicit action of pushing\nand holding a button. More specifically, if person A wishes\nto speak to person B, they press a button and begin\nspeaking; person A's utterance emanates from person B's\ndevice as it is produced, with a network delay identical to\nthat of a mobile phone call. Further, the half-duplex\ncellular radio channel inherently prevents overlap. By\ncontrast, in a full-duplex channel such as a telephone call,\nboth parties transmit continuously during a connection,\ne.g., a participant who is talking can hear audio from the\nother participant such as laughter or a baby crying in the\nbackground.\nIn interviews, participants reported that they did not feel\nthey needed to reply immediately when someone spoke to\nthem via the cellular radio.\nKelly: \"[I feel like I have to answer if somebody says something\nto me] but not immediately. I can do it on my own time... if I'm\nlike busy or something like that, and then when I get a chance\nI'll be like, what did you say, what do you want?\"\n\nTo see an example of this in practice, consider the\nfollowing transcript. During this excerpt, Julie was at\nhome while Todd was at work. Julie and Todd had had\nseveral recent conversational exchanges prior to line 1; the\nlast exchange was 56 seconds ago. Prompted by a\nconversation with a co-present party, Julie asked Todd\nabout communication technologies he uses while at work.\n(\"IM\" refers to instant messaging, a textual medium that\nenables users to set up near-synchronous communication\n\n\fsessions in a lightweight manner [27,34]. \"AIM\" refers to\na specific IM system, AOL\u00ae Instant MessengerTM.)\nExcerpt 1:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nJulie:\nTodd:\nJulie:\n\u00ff\nTodd:\n\nWhy don't you use IM at work?\n((pause of 3 seconds))\nWhat?\n((pause of 0.2 seconds))\nWhy don't you use IM at work?\n((pause of 3 minutes and 13 seconds))\nBecause they don't have AIM here.\n((pause of 1.4 seconds))\n\nNote that in this case, a large pause occurs without apology,\nexplanation, or recrimination within a question-answer\nsequence (marked by \u00ff in line 6). Consider how odd this\nwould be in typical face-to-face or telephone conversation.\nBecause she does not immediately pursue an answer, Julie\nis plainly accounting for Todd's pause \u2013 so long as to\npractically constitute a lapse in talk \u2013 as being caused by\nsome acceptable factor.\nWe observed several important types of ambiguity relating\nto the cellular radios. Here we focus on two that are\nrelevant to reduced accountability to respond quickly.\nFirst, due to the push-to-talk nature of cellular radio\ntransmissions, there was ambiguity about the recipient's\nactivities. As with most types of audio communication,\nbackground noise can be heard while a participant is\ntransmitting. However, because the channel is one-way\nand because users only transmit when they press and hold a\nbutton, information did not \"leak through.\" For example, a\ntransmitter could not hear whether a remote recipient was\nengaged in activities such as conversing with other copresent people or typing. (Contrast this with most audible\nmedia such as telephones and audio spaces which are fullduplex so such activities can easily be heard by the other\nparticipant(s).) Therefore, as far as transmitters knew, a\nrecipient might be doing anything from having an argument\nwith their boss to playing a computer game to politely\nattending to the transmission.\nErica: \"I understand to wait if I'm talking to anybody till they're\nfree and stuff [if they don't answer]... I tried to message Julie\nearlier but it wasn't working and I figured she was probably at\nwork, busy in a meeting or something.\"\n\nAgain, as in Excerpt 1, we see how participants tended to\naccount for lapses in positive ways. Of course, nonresponsive participants may in fact have been rudely\nignoring messages, but the ambiguity allowed participants\nto construe reasons that were socially acceptable.\nSecond, several factors resulted in ambiguity about whether\nor not a transmission was received. Although the cellular\nradios were mobile, participants were not always within\nhearing distance (e.g., they might have left the handset on a\ndesk while in the bathroom). Since the medium was not\npersistent (reviewable [6], recordable [20]), transmissions\nsent during such periods were lost. Additionally, the\n\nmedium was not entirely reliable, as transmissions were\noccasionally dropped by the network.\nDiscussion\n\nThe flexibility to reduce responsiveness without causing\nsocial difficulties can be quite valuable.\nThis raises an\nobvious design question: are there simple principles for\naffording the kind of conversational ambiguity described\nabove?\nIn fact, the fieldwork on lightweight\ncommunication systems has identified a number of system\ndesign factors that appear to relate to reduced\nresponsiveness. However, while these are likely to be\nuseful in guiding design in a heuristic manner, predicting\nthe final outcome may be more difficult.\nThe fieldwork on IM suggests two such factors. The first\nrelates to a lack of \"leak-through\" (similar to that noted in\ncellular radio). In particular, there is the notable finding\nthat recipients report a feeling of plausible deniability [27].\nThat is, recipients rely on the sender's lack of information\nto excuse a lack of responsiveness: \"[T]he sender generally\ndoesn't know for certain whether the intended recipient is\nthere or not. As a result, failing to respond is not\nnecessarily interpreted as rude or unresponsive\" [27]. Note\nthat this is not restricted to the initiation of an interaction.\nIn ongoing interactions, replies to messages may be\ndelayed, or interaction may (more rarely) lapse without\nexplanation [27,34]. The person waiting at the other end\nsimply has to assume that the other participant had some\nreason to stop responding because they have little visibility\ninto the other participant's environment. (Even if positive\npresence information is available, senders do not always\nassume that the recipient is necessarily able to reply and\ntherefore obligated to respond.) It is remarkable to find\nsimilar ambiguity-related behavior in both IM (a desktop,\ntext-based system) and cellular radio (a mobile, audiobased system). The second relates to reviewability. It is\nsuggested that message persistence makes it safer to delay\nresponses in IM \u2013 the message is a reminder to respond,\nand both the sender and recipient are aware of this [27].\nThe fieldwork on text messaging suggests a third factor,\none that relates to mobility. SMS text messaging enables\nusers to send short, asynchronous messages between\nmobile phones. It is reported that recipients feel pressure to\nreply \"immediately\" [22] (though timescales vary) and,\nmore importantly, to explain any delays in replying\n[22,23,33]; it has been suggested that recipients may feel\nthis pressure because the sender is aware that the handset is\ncarried \"at all times\" [22,23]. (Note that reviewability\nplays an implicit role here as well.)\nWhile these factors are plausible, it may prove difficult to\nreason about them in aggregate. From Table 1, it is hard to\nidentify individual factors or combinations of factors that\nexplain the reported feelings of plausible deniability and/or\nreduced responsiveness. For example, since the factors in\nTable 1 have been (re)formulated so that each increases the\nexpectation of responsiveness, one might hypothesize that\n\n\fmedium\n\"leak-through\" [27,37]\nnot reviewable [27]\nmobile [22,23]\nreported \"deniability\"\n\nm. phone\naudio\n\nSMS\ntext\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nIM\ntext\n\nc. radio\naudio\nX\nX\n\n[27]\n\n[37]\n\nTable 1. Some factors relating to reduced responsiveness.\n\nmedia with fewer of these factors are more likely to afford\nreduced responsiveness. The difficulty is that SMS and\nIM would be predicted to be more similar than IM and\ncellular radio, which has not been the case.\nThis is hardly an exhaustive analysis, and there are many\nmore factors (such as media affordances, costs and\nconstraints [6,13,36]) that could be investigated. However,\nthere are at least two reasons to suspect that reasoning\nabout a medium in isolation will prove difficult.\nFirst, the factors and the phenomena of interest are\nsomewhat soft. In particular, the reported feelings of\nreduced responsiveness may be more a matter of how\npeople orient to the medium than how they actually behave\nin the medium. For example, people do actually explain\nsome of their response delays in IM, even though they extol\nthe ability it gives them to be unresponsive [34].\nSecond, various factors relating to emergent practice are\nrelevant. Studies of email [13] and IM [34] suggest that\nsenders who do not receive a response to a communication\nappear to account for unresponsiveness in a way that is\nconsistent not only with their understanding of the medium\nbut also with their knowledge of common practice and\nconventions in that medium.\nSuch practices and\nconventions may even have been influenced by other\nmedia; multiple participants in the cellular radio fieldwork\nmade interview comments of the form, \"It's kind of like IM\nover the phone\" [37], offering the comments as a reflexive\nbasis for their unresponsiveness in the cellular radios. A\nmedium constrains, but does not determine, people's\nattitudes and practices around responsiveness [13].\nAt this point, fieldwork has revealed the presence and\nutility of conversational ambiguity in various media.\nHowever, while simple guidelines may be helpful in the\ndesign process, much more work needs to be done before\nwe can predict how conversational ambiguity will operate\nin a given medium. The effectiveness of a design with\nrespect to conversational ambiguity should be evaluated\nthrough trial use.\n\ncommunication systems, showing how they provide\nresources for important social processes. After going\nthrough two illustrative design exercises, we conclude with\na discussion of some broader implications.\nSocial Difficulties Caused by Existing Access Mechanisms\n\nToday, most widely-deployed personal communication\nsystems can be characterized as using static mechanisms\nthat rely on social mediation for access control. That is,\naccess to a given communication channel is enabled by\nsharing a static piece of address information, such as a\nphone number; possession of a given user's address implies\nthe (technological) ability to contact that user at any time.\nPotential contactees are expected to control who has their\naddress, and contacters are expected to behave in a\nreasonable manner. Such social mediation is often difficult.\nThe desire for contact is often asymmetric and it can be\nsocially awkward to refuse to provide contact information\n[25]. Participants in our push-to-talk fieldwork complained\nthat this static access does not meet their changing needs:\nJulie: \"But like you give someone your cellphone number once\nand they think it's like how they can always get ahold of you.\"\n\nThe key issue here is that social relationships (including\nwork relationships) evolve, and as they change, the desire\nof one person to be contacted by another often changes.\nTechnologists often have the idea of putting the contactee\nin total control by using access tokens that can be revoked\nor expired (e.g., [21]); early examples include telephone\nproxy services that allow one to receive live responses to\npersonal advertisements without giving out \"real\" contact\ninformation (for example, see U.S. Patent 4,847,890).\nThis is plausible if the right power relationships are in place\nbetween the parties. However, since it is just as much of a\nunilateral predeclaration of relationship limits as a refusal,\nit is no less problematic in more general settings \u2013 as with\nrefusal, the entire onus of access denial is on the contactee.\nFaced with these issues, users frequently resort to other\nstrategies, such as avoidance. Some strategies greatly\nreduce the utility of the personal communication system.\nFor example, users may change their address information,\nas when a user changes their phone number to avoid a\npersistent caller. More incremental strategies often have\ndrawbacks as well.3 For example, call screening requires\nthe user to modify their call-answering behavior relative to\nall callers for an indefinite period in order to cope with a\nsingle unwanted caller. Ultimately, users may even\nabandon a technology entirely.\n\nCase II: Associational Ambiguity and Leases\n\nWe now turn to the notion of unresponsiveness at the\nassociational level. In the previous subsection, we focused\non an analysis of an existing design. In this subsection, we\nstructure the discussion around the design process and how\nideas related to ambiguity might be worked into it. We\nbegin by reviewing existing support for access in mediated\ncommunication systems. We then introduce the notion of\nleases to allow parties to negotiate access in mediated\n\n3\n\nAn interesting incremental strategy known as \"cyber-ditching\" has\nbecome associated with the youth-oriented Microsoft 3\u00b0 service [38] and\nshows how much effort some users put into avoidance. 3\u00b0 provides a\nnotion of a \"group\" that is akin to a shared desktop workspace for\nsocializing. The designers report that users have investment in their\nscreen names and so prefer not to change them, but since groups are\ninvitation-only, a subset of the original members can effectively \"revoke\"\nthe access of other members by (1) creating a new group and (2) agreeing\nnot to re-invite the excluded members.\n\n\fA Proposal: Leases for Negotiating Access\n\nUsers' strategies for managing access in these static\nsystems are often cumbersome and/or have uncomfortable\nsocial consequences. In the rest of this subsection, we\ndiscuss novel leasing mechanisms that offer users more\nresources for managing who has access to them.\nThe approach we consider here is a service to provide\nrenewable leases of temporary duration. The concept of a\nresource lease is often used in distributed systems\napplications such as file system cache consistency [17]. In\nsuch applications, a resource manager (RM) leases access\nrights to a resource consumer (RC) for an explicitly\nnegotiated time period. At the end of this time period, the\nRM revokes the RC's rights (i.e., the lease expires) unless\nthe RM and RC go through another negotiation and come\nto mutual agreement on a lease renewal. The key aspects\nof a leased resource, then, are (1) initial access is by\nnegotiation between the RM and RC; (2) in the absence of\nappropriate subsequent interaction, access expires without\nfurther action on the RM's part; and (3) renewal occurs\nonly by negotiation, i.e., if the RM and RC both act and\nconcur. Hence, leases are a technical means of capturing\nexpressions of ongoing reciprocal interest between entities.\nAs a design exercise, we applied the notion of leases to\naccess in mediated communication channels. In this design\nspace, the RM and RC are human social actors instead of\nfile system clients and servers.\n(In a bidirectional\ncommunication channel, each user may serve as the RM in\none direction and as the RC in the other.) Initial setup of a\nlease might consist of transmitting a digital representation\nof a cryptographically-secured capability. If renewal\nconditions are met (e.g., both parties contact each other\nfrequently), access continues. Otherwise, if expiration\nconditions are met (e.g., the passage of a specified period\nof time), the lease expires. When a lease expires, the RM is\nnotified, at which point the RM may renew the lease,\nreallocate the lease to someone else, or leave the lease\nunassigned. The RC is not notified about the specific\ncondition causing the expiration or about the precise action\nthe RM has taken.\nThe use of leases in a social context is, of course, mainly\nintended to afford several kinds of ambiguity, particularly\nthose relating to actors, actions and intentions (Figure 1).\nFor example, lease expiration will in some cases be due to a\nmutual failure to act, which distributes the social onus.\nWhere the RC has clearly acted, expiration may have\noccurred because the RM explicitly chose not to renew\n(perhaps by clicking \"I don't want to talk to this person\nanymore\" in a dialog box) or the RM may have simply\nfailed to take some action (perhaps being too busy or\ndistracted to renew). The RC will not know if the RM has\ntaken the more offensive explicit action or committed the\nless offensive action of simply \"forgetting.\" (And, in fact,\nthe RM can offer \"I forgot\" as an explanation if asked in\neither case.) Even if the actions are known, the intentions\nof that party may not be clear. As a result, leases inherently\n\nprovide resources for explanations and stories that are not\navailable with static access mechanisms.\nA few caveats are in order concerning some simplifications\nwe will make for reasons of clarity. The first concerns\nterminology. We will continue to refer to leases as such, to\nthe party issuing the lease to be contacted as the RM, and to\nthe person using the lease to contact the RM as the RC. It\nshould be understood that these exact terms and\nabstractions would not necessarily be presented to endusers. The second concerns the role of leases when there\nare multiple communication media available. We discuss\nleases here as if they correspond to a given medium, but the\nidea can be applied in a variety of ways (many of which are\nrelatively straightforward) that integrate multiple media.\nExercise I: Scarcity as Resource for Stories\n\nWe now turn to the first of our design exercises, which was\ninspired by the observation that people frequently use\nexternally-imposed limitations \u2013 whether real or fictitious \u2013\nas resources for face-work. Such limitations include\nmoney (students often have financial constraints which\nthey discuss explicitly and use as socially acceptable\nexcuses) and time (as when people say they do not have\ntime to talk or to go to dinner). Personal communication\nservice plans are a rich source of explanations, as they\noften impose limitations that are fairly arbitrary from the\nsubscriber's perspective.4 Teens and young adults with\nlimited funds often explain that they cannot talk on the\nphone by saying they are out of minutes.\nThis observation can be translated straightforwardly into a\ndesign in which an RM's service subscription includes a\nfixed number of leases. This may be the same for all users\nof the service, or may vary depending on the price of their\nsubscription; in either case, the key social resource is that\nthe limits appear to derive from a technological or\neconomic basis, as they often do with today's mobile phone\ncalling plans. The limited supply of leases offers a\nplausible explanation of the intent behind a failure to\nrenew: that the RM had to reallocate the lease to someone\nelse with whom they had an urgent need to communicate.\nScenarios were a major part of the exercise; one is\nexcerpted here for illustration. Social science research\nproviding taxonomies of excuses and justifications [31] and\npoliteness strategies [5] can be very helpful in grounding\nthe outcomes of such scenarios.\nExcerpt 2:\nTwo high school girls, Monica and Christina,...are assigned to\nwork together on a class project. Christina (RC) asks Monica\n(RM) for her push-to-talk number so that they will be able to\ncoordinate their work using the cellular radio... [Afterward,]\n4\n\nMobile phone service plans in the United States frequently impose limits\non the number of minutes a subscriber may use during a month, with\nsevere charges for exceeding the limit. The plans are often quite complex,\nimposing differential charges and minute limitations depending on\nwhether the subscriber is contacting a subscriber to the same service\nprovider, or a member of a pre-defined group of friends and family, etc.\n\n\fChristina has an interest in continuing social interactions with\nMonica... Monica [does not and] begins to keep her push-totalk cellular radio turned off most of the time. Alternatively,\nconsider how this situation might play out with a lease. Monica\nallows the lease to expire... Monica can offer a plausible\nexcuse such as \"Oh, sorry, I needed that lease to give to my\nproject partner for my history class. I only have five leases\nbecause my parents won't pay for more. I'll try to get one for\nyou soon.\"\n\nWhether or not the stories seem \"transparent\" is not\n(necessarily) the point. Such explanations are often\ntransparent in that sense; preservation of face requires\ncredibility and the willingness to accept an explanation, not\nactual belief [16].\nIt is important to note that the design process must continue\nto consider social affordances and user interaction issues\nother than associational ambiguity.\nFor example,\nexternally-imposed scarcity has lead to the appropriation of\nsystems as tools for defining and negotiating the status of\nsocial relationships. The limited capacity of mobile phone\naddress books makes them one such tool, as when users\ninspect and even edit each other's address books [19]; this\nis particularly true for the teen and young adult age groups,\nwho are in a phase of life in which defining relationships\nthrough indirect mechanisms is appealing [18,19]. Leases\ncould be similar resource, and additional scenarios have\nconsidered possible practices arising around the initial\nnegotiation of leases; renewal of leases; and even, in some\ncases, the dramatic cancellation of leases.\nExercise II: Context-awareness as Resource for Face-work\n\nOur second design exercise was inspired by ongoing\nresearch in context-aware computing. For example, one\ncould base lease expiration on contextual data, such as the\ndegree of contact between two people for a certain period\nof time \u2013 if the lease was unused, if it was used too much, if\none party failed to return the other party's calls, if the\nparties were not in each other's physical presence, etc.\nThis type of lease increases ambiguity of actor, action, and\nintention because explicit lease-related actions are taken\nonly by the system, and the system is a \"black box.\" In\nparticular, if the system aggregates information about\nmultiple users' implicit actions (e.g., physical proximity), it\ncan be difficult for a given user to draw inferences about\nwhat actions have been taken by another user. In many\ncases, a participant cannot rule out the idea that their own\nactions resulted in the expiration. Note that, in contrast to\nsituations in which mysterious contextual inference\nnegatively impacts usability [4], this is one in which \"black\nbox\" contextual inference may have advantages.\nAs in the previous exercise, scenarios helped in thinking\nout possible outcomes of ambiguity-related strategies as\nwell as technological design issues.\nExcerpt 3:\nMichael and Carrie are both in their thirties. They meet at a bar\nand Michael (RM) gives Carrie (RC) his phone number. They\ndate briefly... Michael becomes disinterested in Carrie and...\n\nstarts screening his calls. [This] affects his telephone behavior\nwith all callers. Alternatively, consider how this situation might\nplay out with a lease. When they first meet, Michael \"beams\" a\nlease from his phone to Carrie's using Bluetooth, one that will\nexpire if two weeks pass without them being physically\nproximate (as measured by their phones recognizing each\nother's Bluetooth identifiers).... When they stop seeing each\nother...the lease expires... Carrie must consider many possible\nexplanations.\n[S]he may decide that they are jointly\nresponsible because they have not been in frequent contact.\nShe might even choose to hold herself primarily responsible,\nthinking that if she had kept her date to meet Michael for coffee\nlast week, the lease might have been renewed...\n\nAgain, both parties' choice of explanation is not just about\nfacts, but also about the degree to which they wish to\npreserve face.\nDiscussion\n\nWith respect to the specific idea of leases, we have\nprovided illustration rather than definitive guidance. The\ndesigner must make a number of strategic choices for any\nparticular implementation, and the intended context for a\ngiven system (user population, situations, etc.) provides key\nfactors in navigating the design space.\nWe intend to\nfollow an iterative design process with these leases,\ndesigning and conducting user studies to learn more about\nwhich mechanisms are most effective in which situations.\nIn this subsection, and in particular in the two design\nexercises, we have attempted to bring out several points\nthat have application beyond leases. First, we have tried to\nillustrate that socially useful forms of associational\nambiguity can be located by examining existing practice\nand how they might be targeted in the design process.\nSecond, while the general idea of adding mechanisms to\nafford such ambiguity may seem to burden the user with\nadditional effort, it should not be dismissed as the specific\nmechanisms can have significant benefits.\nSuch\nmechanisms may be less burdensome than the workarounds\nthat users otherwise employ (such as avoidance), and they\nmay have additional social benefits (such as resources for\ndefining social relationships). Third, we have tried to\nreinforce a point made in the previous design case, which is\nthat while ambiguity mechanisms can provide the space for\nstories and face-work, the rest is up to the participants.\nManaging access still requires skill in story-telling, social\nnegotiation, and managing power relationships [18].\nAMBIGUITY IN DESIGN\n\nIn the previous section, we observed that designing to\nprovide \"appropriate\" resources for ambiguity in\ncommunication systems is not always a straightforward\nproposition. Other areas of research in computer science\nand the social sciences address the question of ambiguity in\ncommunication, and it seems plausible that they could\nprovide guidance. We have touched on many of these\nalready, and in this section, we provide pointers into some\nadditional relevant areas of research, making caveats as\nnecessary about their applicability.\n\n\fDiscussion of ambiguity in the general design literature is\ngenerally limited to attempts to cope with it on the\n\"human\" side of human-computer interaction, such as the\nengineering of systems that must interpret human gestures\n[26]. When ambiguity is discussed on the \"computer\" side\nof HCI, it is generally considered to lead to a frustrating\nuser experience and therefore held to be undesirable. There\nare forceful arguments that the actions of computer systems\nshould be made intelligible to users [9]. It is, of course, a\ndesign truism that a system should \"let the user know what\nis going on\" (even though not all systems do so); this\nadvice is held to be even more important in systems which\ncannot completely hide system complexities [9] or that\nmake inferences about users' intentions [4].\nThere are, however, a number of perspectives that argue for\na role for ambiguity in design:\nCritical design. In a recent paper [14], Gaver et al. draw\non examples from art and critical design to illustrate the\nuses of ambiguity in developing \"engaging and thoughtprovoking\" artifacts. They provide a taxonomy of ways in\nwhich ambiguity can be made relevant to interactive\nsystems design that can serve as a resource for expanding\nour discussion of the active effects of mediation.\nHuman communication. While the focus in this paper has\nbeen on the process of designing to provide resources for\nambiguity, a substantial body of research on human-human\ninteraction can be mined for insights on how the resulting\nstory-telling and face-work might unfold. At least three\nareas can be seen that would be very useful in scenario\nconstruction. First, researchers in areas such as social\npsychology, communication, and sociolinguistics have\nexamined how people communicate ambiguously for\nvarious purposes. For example, there have been detailed\nexaminations of the goals and strategies that people apply\nin face-work [5,16], equivocation [3], and related forms of\ndeception [8] during social interaction. Second, there has\nbeen research on how the technical characteristics of\ndifferent\ncommunication\nmedia\ninteract\nwith\ncommunicative ambiguity. Some was mentioned in the\nfirst design case (e.g., [13]), but there are a number of\ntheories and studies on the ways in which different media\naffect how the content of messages is constructed and\ninterpreted (see [35] for a recent survey). Third, there has\nbeen research on how people choose between various\nmedia that are available to them. For example, studies of\npeople's media choices to facilitate deception [8,20]\nsuggest that different media may be favored based on the\nusers' beliefs about the likely outcome (including others'\ninterpretations) of using them.\nPrivacy. While much work in privacy can be summarized\nas information hiding plus access control, recent HCI work\nhas applied privacy regulation theory from social\npsychology [29]; this theory describes privacy as a dynamic\nand highly contextual boundary regulation process in which\ntechnological mediation plays a role. Research on systems\n\nfor providing activity awareness and presence information\nalso shares many of the concerns discussed in this paper,\nand much of it is quite sophisticated \u2013 for example,\nErickson and Kellogg's notion of social translucence [11].\nAll of these outlooks are useful for design, but perhaps less\napplicable than our framework at the \"micro\" level at\nwhich one analyzes individual conversations.\nWe close this discussion by noting an important difference\nbetween frameworks that consider \"information\" (privacy,\nawareness,...) and a framework that considers \"stories\" and\nface-work. In the former, \"information\" is usually defined\nin a factual way, whereas in the latter, the most important\nelement of successful face-work is not its truth per se but\nthat it is accepted by the participants.\nAmbiguous\nsituations often work as part of a story, not because they are\nfactually convincing, but because they leave room for a\nface-saving formulation of the situation \u2013 and the ongoing\nrelationship is more important than clarity.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have touched upon the complex\nrelationships between ambiguity in social interaction, the\nprocess by which participants in social interaction account\nfor each others' actions, and the relevant technological\naspects of mediated communication systems. In particular,\nwe have highlighted the notion that accounting for others'\nactions is a continual process, both in individual\ninteractions and in relationships; an analysis of a system\ndesign with respect to ambiguity should consider not only\nwhat information passes through the system, but what the\neffects are on a user's ability to account and, when\nnecessary, to execute face-work.\nThis discussion can be expanded in many ways. While the\ndiscussion has been framed quite generally in some\nsections, the design cases presented here are quite specific\n\u2013 they relate to particular interactional difficulties that\noccur in lightweight communication systems. Plainly,\nthere is room for a great deal of theoretical and designoriented generalization. There is also an enormous amount\nof empirical work that needs to be done \u2013 increasing our\nunderstanding of phenomena such as plausible deniability,\nevaluating the effectiveness of leasing in practice, etc.\nHowever, what we have attempted to do is to fortify the\ndialogue between designers of mediated communication\nsystems and social scientists. Rather than simply having\nsocial scientists analyze users' behavior in communication\nsystems that have been designed with relatively arbitrary\nsocial affordances, we hope that future design discussions\nmight include explicit consideration of how users make\nsense of their interactions and relationships.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research has been strongly influenced by our project's\nexpert on conversation analysis, Peggy Szymanski. The\npaper has benefited greatly from reviewer comments.\nErrors and misrepresentations, however, are ours alone.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n1.
