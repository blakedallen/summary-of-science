Introduction\nSeveral classes of enzyme molecules that convert chemical energy into mechanical\nmotion are called motor proteins, or molecular motors. In recent years, these\nproteins have attracted a significant attention because of their importance for multiple\nbiological processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Motor proteins, such as kinesins, myosins, dyneins,\npolymerases and helicases, move in a linear fashion along the rigid biopolymers (actin\nfilaments, microtubules, DNA and RNA molecules). Typically, a fuel for the motion\nof these nanomotors comes from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or\nrelated compounds. Although some progress in understanding the mechanisms of\nmotor proteins has been achieved [3, 4, 5], there are still many unresolved issues.\nOne of the most important fundamental questions concerning motor proteins is how\ndifferent domains of these enzymes coordinate and regulate their complex dynamics\nand functions. The goal of this paper is to address some aspects of this issue from the\ntheoretical point of view.\nThe enzymatic activity of motor proteins takes place in the so-called motor subunits\nthat contain ATP-binding sites. Motor proteins typically have several such domains.\nThe functioning of molecular motors strongly depends on the relative position and\ndynamics of these subunits [3, 5]. Two possible mechanisms for two-headed motor\nproteins have been proposed: an inchworm motion and a hand-over-hand mechanism\n[3, 6]. In the inchworm mechanism one motor domain is always in the leading position,\nwhile another one always trails. However, in the hand-over-hand mechanism the motor\ndomains alternate their leading and trailing positions as the motor protein molecule\nproceeds along the filament track. Single-molecule experiments that utilized fluorescent\nimaging with one-nanometer accuracy (FIONA) have shown that individual doubleheaded kinesins, myosins V and VI, and cytoplasmic dyneins step in the hand-overhand fashion [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Thus, this mechanism explains stepping dynamics of the\nmajority of motor protein species.\nIn the current version of the hand-over-hand mechanism it is assumed that two\nheads move independently from each other, i.e., when the trailing motor subunit moves\nits dynamics is not affected by the presence of another motor subunit. Then a mean\ndwell time to advance one step forward for a heterodimeric motor protein with two\nheads labeled as A and B is given by\n1\n(1)\n\u03c4A/B = (\u03c4A/A + \u03c4B/B ),\n2\nwhere \u03c4A/A and \u03c4B/B are mean dwell times for homodimeric A/A and B/B motor\nproteins, respectively. The corresponding relation for the velocity can be written as\n2VA/A VB/B\n.\n(2)\nVA/B =\nVA/A + VB/B\nHowever recent single-molecule investigations of dynamics of kinesins [12] do not support\nthese relations, and, consequently, the independence of two motor domains during the\nmotion is put in a doubt. In these experiments force-velocity curves and enzymatic\n\n\fInteraction Between Motor Domains in Kinesins\n\n3\n\nactivities have been measured for different homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesins.\nSurprisingly, it was shown that the velocity of the heterodimeric kinesin with a mutation\nin one of the motor heads is not given by Eq. (2). It was suggested that the two heads\nstrongly influence the dynamic and enzymatic properties of each other, although the\nmechanism was not specified. In this paper we present a simple discrete stochastic model\nthat might explain several aspects of the complex dynamics of heterodimeric kinesins.\nOur main idea is that motor domains interact with each other and significantly modify\nthe overall dynamics.\nTheoretical investigations of molecular motors follow several approaches that\ninclude continuum ratchets [13, 14], discrete stochastic models [5] and computer\nsimulations [15, 16]. In this work we utilize a discrete stochastic approach because\nit conveniently provides explicit expressions for dynamic properties, and it is able\nto describe successfully different aspects and trends of motor proteins transport\n[5, 6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\n2. Theoretical Model\nIn our theoretical model it is assumed that a kinesin protein molecule steps from a\ngiven binding site to the next one at a distance d = 8.2 nm along the microtubule\nthrough N intermediate biochemical states. Different kinetic schemes for the motion of\nhomodimeric and heterodimeric kinesin molecules are shown in Fig. 1. Similar approach\nhas been used successfully to describe dynamic properties of kinesins and myosins V\n[5, 17, 21, 22].\nLet us label homodimeric motor proteins of wild type as W/W, homodimeric motor\nproteins with mutations in both heads as M/M, and heterodimeric proteins with only\none mutated motor domain as W/M. Although the motion of motor proteins includes\nmany complex biochemical and biophysical processes, in the simplest approximation it\nis reasonable to use only two-state (N = 2) discrete stochastic models to describe the\ndynamics of both homodimeric kinesins: see Fig. 1. The motor protein molecule can\njump forward from a state 0 to a state 1 with the rate u0 , and this transition corresponds\nto ATP binding, yielding\nu0 = k0 [ATP],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k0 is a rate constant. The reverse transition is given by the rate w1 . The forward\nand backward transitions between the state 1 and the state 0 on the next binding\nsite, with the rates u1 and w0 respectively, describe several biochemical processes, such\nas ATP hydrolysis and release of hydrolysis products, but combine them in one step.\nWe assume that mutations do not affect strongly ATP binding process, but only the\nenzymatic functions are changed, which leads to a different pair of transition rates (u\u20321\nand w0\u2032 ) for the mutated molecule (see Fig. 1). Experiments show that some mutations\ndecrease the binding affinity of motor proteins to microtubules, thus leading to decrease\nin enzymatic activity [12]. The transition rates for W/W and M/M motor proteins are\n\n\f4\n\nInteraction Between Motor Domains in Kinesins\n\nd=8.2 nm\n\n0\n\nu0\nw1\n\n1\n\nu1\n\nd=8.2 nm\n\n0\n\n0\n\nw0\nW/W(N=2)\n\nu0\nw1\n\n0\n\nu'\n1\n1\n\nw'\n0\n\n\u03b5\n\nM/M (N=2)\n\n2d=16.4 nm\n\n0\n\nu0\nw1\n\n(1)\n1\n\nu\n1\n\n0\n\nu0\n\n0\nu(2)\n1\n\u03b52\n(2)\n1 w0\n\nw\nw0(1) \u03b51 1 W/M (N=4)\n\nFigure 1. General schematic view of discrete stochastic models for kinesins. W/W\nlabels the homodimeric motor protein with both wild-type motor heads, M/M\ncorresponds to the homodimeric kinesins with mutations in both motor domains, while\nW/M describes the heterodimeric motor proteins with mutation in only of the heads.\nParameters \u03b5, \u03b51 and \u03b52 describe free energy changes due to mutations relative to the\nwild-type motor proteins.\n\nrelated via the detailed balance condition,\nu\u20321\nu1\nexp(\u2212\u03b5/kB T ).\n(4)\n=\n\u2032\nw0\nw0\nThe parameter \u03b5 describes the effect of mutation on the enzymatic properties of\nthe motor protein, i.e., how the ATP hydrolysis for the mutated homodimer is\nthermodynamically less favorable in comparison with that of wild-type homodimer.\nMicroscopic origin of this parameter is the result of complex interactions between two\nmotor domains and between motor heads and the microtubule track.\nThe situation is more complex for heterodimeric W/M kinesins, as illustrated in\nFig. 1. Two motor domains and interactions between them are different from the cases\nof homodimer kinesins. As a result we have two different sets of rates to model ATP\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\nhydrolysis by the wild head (u1 and w0 ) and by the mutated head (u1 and w0 ).\nThese rates are also related via detailed balance conditions,\n(1)\n\nu1\n\n(1)\nw0\n\nu1\n=\nexp(\u2212\u03b51 /kB T ),\nw0\n\n(2)\n\nu1\n\n(2)\nw0\n\n=\n\nu1\nexp(\u2212\u03b52 /kB T ).\nw0\n\n(5)\n\nIt is important to note that generally, \u03b51 6= \u03b52 6= \u03b5, because of different interactions\nbetween the motor domains. Then, assuming that the hand-over-hand mechanism still\n\n\f5\n\nInteraction Between Motor Domains in Kinesins\n\nis a valid description for the stepping of individual molecules, the dynamics of W/M\nkinesin molecules can be described by N = 4-state model with step size equal to 2d=16.4\nnm.\nThe explicit expressions for the rates can be obtained from Eqs.

Results and Discussion\nIn the experimental work of Kaseda et al. [12] the coordination of two heads for\ndifferent homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesin molecules has been investigated using\nmicrotubule-gliding assays and optical trapping spectroscopy. Different homodimeric\nand heterodimeric motor proteins were prepared by mutations in the motor domains\nthat affect microtubule-binding region. It was found that dynamic properties of\nheterodimeric proteins with one mutated head could not be described by independent\nhand-over-hand stepping mechanism.\nTo analyze experimental data we consider kinesins with only one type of mutation,\nalthough our method can be easily applied to different molecular motor species.\nSpecifically, it was shown [12] that at [ATP]=1 mM a wild-type homodimer travels\nwith the stationary velocity V (W/W ) = 679 \u00b1 59 nm/s, and it produces the maximum\nstall force of FS (W/W ) = 6.3 \u00b1 0.9 pN. When the mutation labeled L12 affects both\nmotor heads the resulting homodimeric M/M kinesin does not attach to microtubules,\nindicating zero velocity and stall force. However, surprisingly, heterodimer with the same\nmutation L12 in one of the motor heads can move with the velocity V (W/M) = 101\u00b125\nnm/s, while exerting the maximal stall force of FS (W/M) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 pN. Then, from\nEqs. (19) and (21) we obtain\n\u03b5 = 12.6 \u00b1 1.8 kB T, \u03b51 + \u03b52 = 11 \u00b1 4.4 kB T.\n(25)\nThe important result is that \u03b51 + \u03b52 < 2\u03b5, which indicates that biochemical properties of\nmutated and wild-type motor heads in the W/M kinesin differ from the corresponding\nproperties in the W/W and M/M motor proteins, supporting our idea of modifying\nfree-energy landscapes for motor proteins via interaction between motor subunits.\nAfter systematically exploring parameter space, we found that all experimental\ndata for kinesins with L12 mutation can be well described by the following parameters,\nk0 = 1.2\u03bcM\u22121 s\u22121 , u1 = 90s\u22121 , w1 = 10s\u22121 , w0 = 0.05s\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 = 0.14, \u01eb = 12.3 kB T, \u03b51 = \u03b52 = 10.6 kB T.\n(26)\nNote that obtained transition rates are similar to parameters previously utilized to\ndescribe the dynamics of single kinesins, and they are consistent with chemical kinetic\nexperimental results [21]. In addition, in our calculations we also used load-distribution\nfactors reported earlier [21],\n\u03b80+ = 0.135, \u03b81\u2212 = 0.080, \u03b81+ = 0.035, \u03b80\u2212 = 0.750.\n\n(27)\n\nThe results of theoretical calculations for the velocities of homodimeric and\nheterodimeric kinesins at different conditions are presented in Fig. 2. The effect of\nexternal load on the motor protein dynamics is shown in Fig. 2a. The force slows down\nthe motion of all motor proteins, as expected. It is found that the stall forces FS for\nW/W and W/M kinesins are equal to 6.2 pN and 0.8 pN respectively, which are in\nexcellent agreement with experimentally measured values [12]. The force-velocity curve\nfor heterodimer is essentially linear, while for homodimeric W/W kinesins it deviates\n\n\fInteraction Between Motor Domains in Kinesins\n\n8\n\nfrom the linear dependence. Again, this theoretical result agrees well with experimental\nobservations (compare with Fig. 4b from Ref. [12]). The dependence of the velocity on\nthe concentration of ATP (see Fig. 2b) shows typical Michaelis-Menten character, i.e.,\na linear behavior at small concentrations of ATP and a saturation at large [ATP]. One\nof the important theoretical predictions of our model is that the heterodimeric kinesin\nwith L12 mutation in one of the motor heads will not function (V = 0) even without\nexternal resisting force (F = 0) for ATP concentrations smaller than 0.186 mM. This\ntheoretical prediction can be easily tested in experiments.\nIn addition to the mean velocity, an important characteristic of the motor protein\ndynamics is a diffusion constant or dispersion [5]. In our theoretical framework it can\nbe calculated exactly, and the results of these computations are given in Fig. 3. The\neffect of external forces on dispersions for homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesins is\nshown Fig. 3a. External forces have qualitatively different effects on the fluctuations\nof wild-type and mutated motor proteins. Dispersion for homodimeric W/W kinesins\nis a decreasing function of the external load, while for homodimeric M/M proteins it\nincreases. It is interesting to note that the behavior of the heterodimeric W/M is nonmonotonic, depending on the strength of the external forces. At low external loads\n(F \u2264 1 pN) the dispersion of W/M kinesins decreases, as is for W/W kinesins, however\nfor larger external forces it starts to increase, similarly to M/M kinesins. Dispersion as\na function of [ATP] is plotted in Fig. 3b. Again, the behavior of heterodimeric W/M\nproteins is intermediate between wild-type and fully mutated homodimeric kinesins.\nOur theoretical calculations of dynamic properties and analysis of the experimental\nobservations for homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesins suggest the following\nmechanistic (however strongly simplified) picture of the motor protein dynamics.\nMutations change the free energy landscapes for the enzymatic activity and the\nmechanical processivity of molecular motors. However, motor domains in W/W, M/M\nand W/M proteins interact with each other differently, leading to different free energy\nsurfaces. As a result, two heads in the heterodimeric molecule become very similar\nin the biochemical properties, but different from the corresponding motor domains in\nthe homodimers. The heterodimeric motor protein still moves along the microtubules\nin the hand-over-hand mechanism, although with the transition rates modified by\ninteraction between motor heads. We suggest that this theoretical picture can be tested\nin experiments by, for example, labeling differently both motor domains to obtain a\nnecessary dynamic information.\n4. Conclusions\nWe developed a simple theoretical description of the dynamics of motor proteins based\non the discrete sequential stochastic models. This approach allows us to resolve the\ncontradiction between experimental observations on homodimeric and heterodimeric\nkinesins and the widely accepted hand-over-hand stepping mechanism for two-headed\nmolecular motors. It is argued that the interaction between motor domains can modify\n\n\f9\n\nInteraction Between Motor Domains in Kinesins\n\nWT/WT\nWT/L12\n\nVelocity (nm/s)\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n[a]\n\n5\n\n3\n4\nLoad F (pN)\n\n6\n\nVelocity (nm/s)\n\n600\nWT/L12\nWT/WT\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n[b]\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n[ATP] (mM)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. a) Force-velocity curves for W/W homodimeric kinesins (black line)\nand for W/M heterodimeric kinesins (red line) at [ATP]=1 mM. b) Velocities of\nW/W homodimeric kinesins (black line) and W/M heterodimeric kinesins (red line)\nas a function of [ATP] at the constant external force F = 0.5 pN.
