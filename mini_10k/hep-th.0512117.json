Extending it to less supersymmetric cases [3-16] may allow\nus to find simple string-theoretic descriptions of various dynamical aspects of gauge theories,\nfrom high-energy scattering to confinement in phenomena. The generalization of AdS/CFT\nduality to the non-BPS string mode sector can be guided by semiclassical considerations as\nsuggested in [3-6]. In particular, the investigations of [5,6] had found that using the novel\nmulti-spin string states one can carry out the precise test of the AdS/CFT duality in a\nnon-BPS sector by comparing the J\u03bb2 \u226a 1 expansion of the classical string energy with the\ncorresponding quantum anomalous dimensions in perturbative SYM theory [7-9].\nIn recent Lunin and Maldacena [10] had demonstrated that certain deformation of the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background corresponds to a \u03b2-deformation of N = 4 SYM gauge theory in\nwhich the supersymmetry being broken was studied by Leigh and Strassler [11]. Since then\nthere are many studies of AdS/CFT correspondence in the \u03b2-deformation Lunin-Maldacena\nbackground [12-15].\nIn a previous publication [16] we considered the magnetic-flux deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 4 and\nAdS4 \u00d7 S 5 background which are obtained by performing the dimensional reduction of the\n10D spacetime of the N D3-branes through the transformation of mixing azimuthal and\ninternal coordinate, the \"twist\" identification of a circle [17,18]. The new backgrounds may\nbe regarded as those with Melvin magnetic flux [19]. As the supersymmetry in the deformed\nAdSm \u00d7 S n backgrounds has been broken by the presence of magnetic field they offer the\nspacetimes to study the AdS/CFT correspondence with less supersymmetry.\nIn this paper we will apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate [17,18 ] or mixing time and internal coordinate [20,21] to the 11D M-theory with a\nstack N M2 branes [22] and then use T duality [23,24] to find the spacetime of a stack of\nN D3-branes with external magnetic or electric field. In the near-horizon limit the background becomes the magnetic or electric field deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . As the isometry groups\nof AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 are SO(2, 4) \u00d7 SO(6) which are exactly the conformal group and R-symmetry\nof N = 4 supper Yang-Mills theory the background studied in this paper will be more\nphenomenally interesting.\nWe will first use the method in [5,6] to find the classical rotating string solutions which\nare rotating in deformed S 5 with three equal angular momenta J in the three rotation planes.\nThe relations between the classical string energy and its angular momenta are found. The\nresults show that the external magnetic and electric fluxes will increase the classical string\nenergy. We also investigate the small fluctuations in these solution and discuss the effects of\nthe magnetic and electric fields on the stability of these classical rotating string solutions.\n\n2\n\n\fAs the corrections to the classical string energy, from the AdS/CFT point of view, give\nthe anomalous dimensions of operators in the dual SYM theory our results therefore are of\nprimary interest. We next use the method in [25,26] to find the classical pulsating string\nsolutions and show that the corrections to the anomalous dimensions of operators in the\ndual SYM theory are non-negative.\nIn section II we study the case of classical rotating string in the electric field deformed\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and in section III the case in the magnetic field deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . In section\nIV we study the string pulsating on the deformed spacetimes. In section V we discuss our\nresults.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nRotating String in Electric Field Deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nElectric Field Deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nWe now apply the transformation of mixing time and internal coordinate [20,21] to the 11D\nM-theory with a stack N M2-branes [22] and then use the T duality [23,24] to find the\nspacetime of a stack of N D3- branes with electric flux.\nThe full N M2-branes solution is given by [22]\nds211 = H\n\n\u22122\n3\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 + H 3 dx23 + d\u03c12 + \u03c12 \u03a925 + dx211 ,\n\nd\u03a925 \u2261 d\u03b3 2 + cos2 \u03b3d\u03c621 + sin2 \u03b3(d\u03c8 2 + cos2 \u03c8 d\u03c622 + sin2 \u03c8 d\u03c623 ),\nA(3) = H \u22121dt \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 .\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nH is the harmonic function defined by\nH =1+\n\nR\nr D\u2212p\u22123\n\nr 2 \u2261 x23 + \u03c12 + x211 ,\n\n,\n\nR\u2261\n\n16\u03c0GD Tp N\n,\nD\u2212p\u22123\n\n(2.3)\n\nin which GD is the D-dimensional Newton's constant and Tp the p-brane tension.

This can be obtained by solving the\nequations of \u03b3(\u03c3) and \u03c8(\u03c3) associated to the Lagrangian (2.17), and imposing the conformal\ngauge constraints of (2.15).

We now use the above results to analyze two cases.\n\n\u221a\n1. \u03bd = 0: In this case, using (2.26) we see that E = 2 n sin\u03b30 , J1 = 0 and J =\n\u221a\n1\n1 \u2212 E 2 n sin2 \u03b30 , thus\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\nnJ > 2 nJ .\n(2.27)\nE=\n1\n(1 \u2212 E 2 ) 4\nTherefore the external electric fluxes will increase the string energy. To analyze the stability\nof the above solution we recall that, without the E field the problems of the stability of the\nrotating string in the S 5 had been investigated in detail in [5] by Frolov and Tseytlin. The\nresult of appendix A.2 in [5] had shown that the rotating string is stable only if\n3\n0 \u2264 \u03ba2 \u2264 .\n2\n\n6\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fWe claim that the above criterion could still be used in the electric field deformed S 5 background. This is because that the Lagrangian associated to the metric eq.(2.13) used to\ninvestigate the fluctuation field in the deformed case is equal to that used in the undeformed\n\u221a\nt\ncase, up to an overall constant value \" 1 \u2212 E 2 \", after rescaling the time by t \u2192 \u221a1\u2212E\n2.\nTherefore, the criterion (2.28) would not be changed in the case with electric field deforma1\ntion. Now, from (2.25), (2.26) and (2.27) we know that \u03ba2 = (1 \u2212 E 2 ) E 2 = 4 (1 \u2212 E 2 ) 2 nJ.\nThus the criterion (2.28) becomes\n0 < J < Jc \u2261\n\n3\n1\n\n8n (1 \u2212 E 2 ) 2\n\n.\n\n(2.29)\n\n3\nthe electric fields therefore have inclinations to improve the stability of these\nAs Jc > 8n\nclassical rotating string solutions.\n\n\u221a\n2. \u03bd \u226b n: In this case, using (2.26) we see that J1 + 2J \u2248 1 \u2212 E 2 \u03bd and sin2 \u03b30 \u2248\n\u221a 2J\n= J12J\n, thus\n+2J\n1\u2212E 2 \u03bd\nJ1 + 2J\n.\n(2.30)\nE\u2248\u221a\n1 \u2212 E2\nTherefore the external electric fluxes will increase the string energy. To analyze the stability\nof the above solution we recall that, without the E field the problems of the stability of the\nabove rotating string in the S 5 had been investigated in detail in [6] by Frolov and Tseytlin.\nThe result of eq.(2.36) in [6] had shown that the rotating string is stable only if\n3\n0 \u2264 sin2 \u03b30 \u2264 .\n4\n\n(2.31)\n\nFollowing the discussion in the previous case we see that the above criterion could still be\nused in the electric field deformed S 5 background. In the case of \u03bd \u226b 1 we can substitute\nthe relation sin2 \u03b30 \u2248 J12J\ninto the criterion (2.23) and find that\n+2J\n0<\n\n3\n2J\n\u2264\nJ1 + 2J\n4\n\n\u21d2\n\n3\nJ\n\u2264 .\nJ1\n2\n\n(2.32)\n\nThis means that the electric fields does not change stability of these classical rotating string\nsolutions. Let us make two comments to conclude this section.\n1. As the correction to the rotating classical string energy is positive then, from the\nAdS/CFT point of view, the correction of the anomalous dimensions of operators in the\ndual SYM theory will be positive.\n2. In principle, there are the dilaton and anti-symmetric fields terms in the string Lagrangian. However, as the induced metric of the rotating string solution found in this section\nis flat and there is not NS-NS B2 field in our background the action (2.14) is a proper one\nto be used. The property also reveals in the section III.\n\n7\n\n\fRotating String in Magnetic Field Deformed AdS5 \u00d7\n\n3\n\nS5\n\n3.1\n\nMagnetic Field Deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nWe now apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate [17,18 ] to\nthe 11D M-theory with a stack N M2-branes [22] and then use the T duality [23,24] to find\nthe spacetime of a stack of N D3- branes with magnetic flux.\nUsing the full N M2-branes metric described in (2.1) we can transform the angle \u03c61 by\nmixing it with the compactified coordinate x11 in the following substituting\n\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c61 + Bx11 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nUsing the above substitution the line element (2.1) becomes\nds211\n\n=H\n\n\u22122\n3\n\n1\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 + H 3 dx23 + d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03b3 2 +\n2\n\n+sin\n\n\u03b3d\u03a923\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n+H\n\n1\n3\n\n\u0010\n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n1 + B \u03c1 cos \u03b3\n\n\u0011\n\ncos2 \u03b3 d\u03c621\nd\u03c621\n2\n2\n2\n1 + B \u03c1 cos \u03b3\n\nB\u03c12 cos2 \u03b3 d\u03c621\ndx11 +\n1 + B 2 \u03c12 cos2 \u03b3\n\n!2\n\n,\n\nd\u03a923 \u2261 d\u03c8 2 + cos2 \u03c8 d\u03c622 + sin2 \u03c8 d\u03c623 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nUsing the relation between the 11D M-theory metric and string frame metric, dilaton field\nand 1-form potential described in (2.6) the 10D IIA background is then described by\nds210 = H\n\n\u22121\n2\n\nq\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n\nq\n\n\u0010\n\n1 + B 2 \u03c12 cos2 \u03b3 \u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 + H 2 1 + B 2 \u03c12 cos2 \u03b3 dx23 + d\u03c12\n2\n\n+\u03c1\n\ncos2 \u03b3 d\u03c621\nd\u03b3 +\nd\u03c621 + sin2 \u03b3 d\u03a923\n1 + B 2 \u03c12 cos2 \u03b3\n2\n\n!!\n\n.\n\n(3.3)\n\nB\u03c12 cos2 \u03b3\n.\n(3.4)\n2 (1 + B 2 \u03c12 cos2 \u03b3)\nIn this decomposition into ten-dimensional fields which do not depend on the x11 , the tendimensional Lagrangian density will be described by (2.9) and the parameter B is the magnetic field defined by B 2 = 12 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd |\u03c1=0 .

However, as the algebra in there is too complex we will first consider the case of\n\u03bd = 0 under a small magnetic flux.\n\n10\n\n\f1. \u03bd = 0: In this case, using (3.18) we can express cos2 \u03b30 as a function of J, i.e.\n4J\nJ\n2J\n1\u2212\nB 2 + O(B 4 ).\n)+\ncos \u03b30 = (1 \u2212\nn\nn\nn\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.19)\n\nSubstituting this relation into (3.16) we obtain a simple form of the string energy\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\u221a\n2J\nB 2 + O(B 4 ).\nE = 2 nJ +\nnJ 1 \u2212\n2\nn\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe second term is the corrected energy raised from the Melvin magnetic flux which deforms\nthe S 5 . As a rotating string with 12 \u2264 Jn will be a unstable solution, which is investigated in\nthe following, the above result shows that the stable rotating string has a positive corrected\nenergy.\nTo analyze the stability of the above rotating string solution we can also use the criterion\n(2.28), 0 \u2264 \u03ba2 \u2264 32 , in the case of weak magnetic flux. The reason is that, from (3.8) we see\nthat the magnetic flux B 2 only appears in the combination form \"1 + B 2 cos2 \u03b3(\u03c3)\". Thus,\nduring considering the fluctuation of the field \u03b3 we shall replace \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b30 + \u03b3\u0303(t, \u03c3) in the\noriginal Lagrangian. Then the combination form could be approximated by 1 + B 2 cos2 (\u03b30 +\n\u03b3\u0303(t, \u03c3)) \u2248 1 + B 2 cos2 \u03b30 , in the case with a small value of B 2 . Thus, the Lagrangian used\nto investigate the fluctuation field \u03b3 in the deformed case is equal to that used in the\n\u221a\nundeformed case, up to an overall constant value \" 1 + B 2 cos2 \u03b30 \", after rescaling the field\n\u22121/2\nby \u03c61 \u2192 (1 + B 2 cos2 \u03b30 )\n\u03c61 . Therefore, the criterion (2.28) would not be changed under\na small magnetic-flux deformation. Now, as found in (3.19) we have expressed cos2 \u03b30 as a\nfunction of J, we can now substitute this relations into (3.14) and (3.15) and, therefore can\nexpress \u03ba as a function of J. Substituting the function into the criterion (2.28) we finally\nobtain a simple relation\n0\u2264J \u2264\n\n3\n1\n3\n1+\n\u2212 2 B 2 + O(B 4 ).\n8n\n2 8n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhich is the stability criterion of the rotating string in the deformed spacetime. We thus see\nthat magnetic fluxes have inclination to improve the stability of the string solutions.\nNote that, although the metric (3.7), which represents a deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , is different\nform that in our previous paper [16], which represents a deformed AdS4 \u00d7S 5 , as the string we\nconsidered is fixed on the spatial coordinates in AdS5 and AdS4 respectively, the background\nconsidered in the both cases indeed have the same deformed S 5 space. (Some calculation\nerrors of the previous paper are corrected in this paper.)\n2. \u03bd \u226b n: In this case, using (3.17) and (3.18) we can find that\ncos2 \u03b30 =\n\nJ1\n.\nJ1 + 2J\n\n11\n\n(3.22)\n\n\fAs (3.17) tells us that \u03bd can be expressed as a function of J1 and cos2 \u03b30 , we can therefore\nsubstitute (3.22) into (3.16) to obtain a simple form of the string energy\nE = (2J + J1 )\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\nJ1\n2J + J1\n\n\u00132\n\nB2 ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhich tells us that there is a positive corrected energy raised from the Melvin magnetic flux\nwhich deforms the S 5 . To analyze the stability of the above rotating string solution we can\nfollow the previous argument to see that the criterion (2.31), 0 \u2264 sin2 \u03b30 \u2264 43 , could also be\nused here. Now, substituting the relation (3.22) into the criterion (2.31) we finally obtain\nthe criterion of a stable rotating string\nJ\n3\n\u2264 .\nJ1\n2\n\n(3.24)\n\nwhich shows that the magnetic fluxes does not change the stability property of the string\nsolutions. Note that as the correction to the rotating classical string energy is positive then,\nfrom the AdS/CFT point of view, the correction of the anomalous dimensions of operators\nin the dual SYM theory will be positive.\n\n4\n\nPulsating Strings in Electric and Magnetic Fields\nDeformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nWe will follow the method in [25] to find the possible pulsating string solutions in the electric\nand magnetic field deformed spacetimes.\n\n4.1\n\nPulsating String Solution in Electric Field Deformed S 5\n\nTo proceed, we first identify t with \u03c4 and \u03c61 with m\u03c3 to allow for multiwrapping and\nconsider a circular pulsating string expanding and contracting on S 5 .

If we are interested in large quantum numbers, the potential\nmay be considered as a perturbation and we can proceed by considering free wavefunctions\non S5 and then do first order perturbation theory to find the correction. Denoting the total\nS5 angular momentum quantum number by L and the total angular momentum quantum\nnumber on S3 by J the corresponding zero-order wavefunction had been found in [25]. To\nthe first order correction it was found that\nL2 \u2212 J 2\n,\n(4.5)\n2L2\nwhich was calculated in eq.(2.9) of [25].

The Nambu-Goto action corresponding to the metric (3.8) becomes\nS = \u2212m\n\nZ\n\ndt cos\u03b3\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b3\u0307 2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b3 gij \u03c6\u0307i \u03c6\u0307j ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere gij is the metric on S3 described in (3.8) and \u03c6i refers to the coordinates on S3 . As the\naction is independent of magnetic field B the pulsating string solution is exactly like that in\n[25].\nIt shall be remarked that this trivial behavior may be traced to the special pulsating\nstring we assumed. Other pulsating string solutions like those described [26] are difficult to\nbe investigated and are expected to have nontrivial behaviors. Note also that we have only\nconsidered the strings on the deformed S 5 spacetimes in this paper. The coordinates of the\ndeformed AdS5 spacetime in (2.12) or (3.7) are mathematically complex and it is difficult to\nstudy the strings therein. The problems remain to be investigated.\n\n13\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate or\nmixing time and internal coordinate to the 11D M-theory with a stack N M2-branes to find\nthe spacetime of a stack of N D2-branes with magnetic or electric flux in 10 D IIA string\ntheory, after the Kaluza-Klein reduction. We perform the T duality to the spacetimes to\nfind the backgrounds of a stack of N D3-branes with magnetic or electric flux. In the nearhorizon limit the background becomes the magnetic or electric field deformed AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\nIn contrast to the previous study in which the background were magnetic-flux deformed\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 4 and AdS4 \u00d7 S 5 , the isometry groups of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 is SO(2, 4) \u00d7 SO(6) which\nare exactly the conformal group and R-symmetry of N = 4 supper Yang-Mills theory, the\nbackgrounds studied in this paper will be more phenomenally interesting.\nWe have found the classical spinning string solutions which are rotating in the deformed\n5\nS with three angular momenta J in the three rotation planes. The relations between\nthe classical string energy and its angular momenta are obtained and results show that\nthe external magnetic and electric fluxes will increase the string energy. Therefore, from the\nAdS/CFT point of view, the corrections to the anomalous dimensions of operators in the dual\nSYM theory will be positive. We have investigated the small fluctuations in these solutions\nand discuss the effects of magnetic and electric fields on the stability of these classical rotating\nstring solutions. We have also found the possible solutions of string pulsating on the deformed\nspacetime. From the corrections to the pulsating string energy we see that the corrections\nto the anomalous dimensions of operators in the dual SYM theory are non-negative.\nAs the supersymmetry is broken by the magnetic or electric field there will in general\nappear tachyon when the string is in the magnetic or electric deformed spacetime. However,\nas the classical solutions studied in this paper correspond to the states with large quantum\nnumber the tachyon will not be shown. It will be interesting to find the string spectrum by\nfollowing the method in [27] to see more properties of the effects of the magnetic or electric\nfield on the rotating and pulsating string solutions. Also, the correspondence between spin\nchain [28] and classical strings in the electric or magnetic filed deformed AdS 5 \u00d7S 5 , which can\nimprove our understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence, are deserved to be investigated.\nFinally, it is known from AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 case that in order to establish the correspondence\nrelation between the energy and spins to the anomalous dimension it is important to prove\nthat the non Cartan elements of the angular momentum are vanishing. Also, as the energy\nof a string state is conjectured to be equal to the scaling dimension of the dual gauge theory\noperator it is important to find the Yang-Mills operators corresponding to the classical\nrotating and pulsating strings in the magnetic or electric field deformed spacetimes. (The\ncorresponding operators in the undeformed backgrounds had been studied in [4,5,6,25].)\n\n14\n\n\fTo complete the analysis from AdS/CFT point of view we shall also develop Bethe ansatz\nanalysis [29,30] and compare the above result to that in SYM side. These important problems\nare left to further research.\n\nReferences\n1. J. M. Maldacena, \"The large N limit of superconformal field theories and supergravity,\" Adv.\nTheor. Math.
