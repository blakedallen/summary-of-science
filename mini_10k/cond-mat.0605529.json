If these MEPDs are supposed to have\na physical and statistical meaning, then they must be real and positive. The q-exponential function\nhowever is not always a real and positive quantity. Usually, to avoid negative or complex values of the\nmicrostate probabilities for some energy values, one introduces cut-off prescriptions. One example of\nthis is the \"Tsallis cut-off prescription\" (3) which simply sets pi = 0 whenever this is the case. This is\nnot necessarily an ad-hoc requirement. For instance in self-gravitating systems, as in the case of stellar\npolytropic distributions, cut-offs arise naturally and correspond to a gravitational escape velocity (4).\nAnother scenario leading naturally to Tsallis' cut-off is the case of a system S with energy levels \u03b5i coupled\nto a finite heat-bath B with quasi-continuous energy level distributions. A. R. Plastino and A. Plastino\nshowed (5) that if the heat-bath's number of states with energy less or equal than, say E, increases as a\npower law of E, then Tsallis' cut-off implies the obvious fact that the probability to find the system with\nenergy \u03b5i \u2265 E0 , with E0 the total energy of the \"total\" system S+B, is zero.\nHowever, there are other systems where one has no reason to set a priori a cut-off on the energy levels\n(e.g. on asymptotic behaviors like in a Maxwellian velocity distribution or a black body radiation curve\nor other quantum distributions). For these kind of situations Teweldeberhan, Plastino and Miller (6)\nsuggested to redefine the q-generalized exponential function itself such that \"it leads, via the maximum\nentropy principle, to quantum distribution functions that have been very successful in the study of a concrete and important physical phenomena: high TC superconductivity\", and working with this special case\nthe thermodynamical consistency of their cut-off prescription is shown. Proposing alternative definitions\nof the q-exponential function as has done in this case is one possible way and is inescapable if one wants\nto maintain a continuously varying q-parameter. However, we might also wonder which are the discrete\nvalues of the q-parameter for which the generalized exponential remains nevertheless always real and\npositive such that no cut-off and no redefinition of the q-exponential function is needed.\nHere we will investigate for this purpose the deformed logarithm-exponential representation of probability distributions (PD) and entropy measures subjected to Jaynes' MEP focussing our attention on the\ndual description of generalized statistics. We will first study some properties of the generalized exponential and logarithmic function and, investigating the domain where the former maintains itself real and\npositive, outline what role the known dualities q \u2194 q1 and q \u2194 2 \u2212 q play. This will then be applied to\nmicrocanonical PDs and q-deformed generalized entropy measures. We will show how these q-generalized\nentropy measures and MEPDs with no cut-off prescriptions (i.e. no energy constraints) are positive and\nreal (as any meaningful physical measure should be) only for discrete values of the q-parameter and will\ndetermine these explicitly.\n\n2\n\nThe spectrum of the q-deforming parameter for real generalized exponentials\n\nThroughout the literature the application of the q-deformed generalized exponential and logarithm function has become commonplace. As it is well known the usual Euler exponential ex can be defined as\nthe solution of the differential equation y(x)\u2032 = y(x). The q-deformed exponential can be regarded as a\ngeneralization in the sense that it can be obtained from the solution of\ny \u2032 (x) = y(x)q\n\n(2.1)\n\nand initial condition y(0) = 1, with q a real parameter, as\n1\n\nexq \u2261 eq [x] = [1 + (1 \u2212 q)x] 1\u2212q ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich becomes the exponential function for q = 1. The inverse of the q-exponential is the generalized\nq-logarithm function\nx1\u2212q \u2212 1\n,\nlogq x =\n1\u2212q\n2\n\n\fwhich, for q = 1, becomes the common Napier logarithm.\nUseful for our purposes will be the fact that\neq [x + y] = eq [\u03b3x] eq [y] ;\nwith\n\u03b3=\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 R\n\n(2.3)\n\n1\n.\n1 + (1 \u2212 q)y\n\nThere are many indications (7) which suggest that statistical theories based on functionals of power\nlaw PDs (or probability density functions) obeying (2.1) describe correctly several complex systems.\nNow, the generalized exponential (2.2) is a quantity of type eq [x] = a(x, q)b(q) with\na(x, q) = 1 + (1 \u2212 q)x\n\n;\n\nb(q) =\n\n1\n,\n1\u2212q\n\nand which can take real or complex, positive or negative values according to what we choose for a(x, q)\nand b(q). Obviously, if a(x, q) is a real and positive quantity for some x, then a(x, q)b(q) is always real\n1\nfor every b(q) \u2208 R, i.e. for every q such that eq [x] = [1 + (1 \u2212 q)x] 1\u2212q remains real and positive. But\nonce an interval Ix = [x1 , x2 ] for x1 , x2 \u2208 R is chosen, also a continuous interval Iqcont = [q1 , q2 ] is fixed\nso that a(x, q) = 1 + (1 \u2212 q)x \u2265 0 always. While for every q outside Iqcont it is a(x, q) < 0, \u2200x \u2208 Ix . In\nthis case eq [x] might become complex. To know where this precisely does not occur we can write\neq [x] = a(x, q)b(q) = (\u22121)b(q) |a(x, q)|b(q) = ei\u03c0b(q) |a(x, q)|b(q) ,\nwhich is real if and only if b(q) = k for every k \u2208 Z (and is positive for k even and negative for k odd).\nThen, defining\n\u0010\nx \u0011k\nk \u2208 Z/{0}\neq(k) [x] = 1 +\nk\nas the \"discrete spectrum generalized exponential \", to distinguish it from the \"continuous spectrum\ngeneralized exponential \" eq [x], one establishes that the generalized exponential is real on all Ix iff\n1\nb(q) = 1\u2212q\n= k \u2208 Z, i.e. when eq [x] \u2261 eq(k) [x] with\n{q(k)} =\n\n\u001a\n\nk\u22121\n; k \u2208 Z/{0}\nk\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\n1 2 3\n4 3\n0, , , , ..., 1 \u2229 1, ..., , , 2 .\n2 3 4\n3 2\n\nThe figures in the appendix trace the behavior of the discrete spectrum generalized exponential for\nsome examples of the above set of q-parameters.\nThe q-exponential is always positive for k even (Fig.1 with k \u2208 Z+ /{0}, and Fig.2 with k \u2208 Z\u2212 /{0}),\ni.e. given l \u2208 Z/{0} for all\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001a\n1 3 5\n7 5 3\n2l \u2212 1\n=\n.\n, , , ..., 1 \u2229 1, ..., , ,\n{q(l)} =\n2l\n2 4 6\n6 4 2\nIt can become negative if k is odd (Fig.3 with k \u2208 Z+ /{0}, and Fig.4 with k \u2208 Z\u2212 /{0}), i.e. given l \u2208 Z\nfor all\n\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\n2l\n2l\n2 4 6\n6 4\n{q(l)} =\n=\n= {0} \u2229\n, , ..., 1 \u2229 1, ..., , , 2 ,\n2l + 1\n2l \u2212 1\n3 5 7\n5 3\nwhere q = 1 is a point of accumulation of the discrete spectrum.1\nTherefore, in general, outside the continuous parameter space for q, in order to maintain a generalized\nexponential to be a real quantity on all the domain Ix , only discrete values of 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2 are allowed.\n1 From the graphs it becomes also clear how to approximate e [x] \u2248 ex for q \u2248 1, must be done cautiously since e [x]\nq\nq\ncan diverge in some regions from Euler's exponential for every value which is not exactly q = 1. On the other side,\nif PD are expressed with q-exponentials, the infinities for q > 1 and x > 0 (in Fig. 2 and Fig.4) might at first look\nworrisome. However, as we will see later, the partition function of MEPDs renormalizes these divergences (see eq. 3.2).\nThe discontinuities of the q-exponential should cause no concern for stationary normalized PDs.\n\n3\n\n\fNow, note also how there exists (except, of course, for the special case q = 0) a one-to-one correspondence\n1\n(2.4)\n\u03c0:q\u2194\nq\n(i.e. the Fig.1\u2194Fig.4 and Fig.2\u2194Fig.3 correspondences) of the discrete spectrum between the real even\n(always positive) and a real odd (negative somewhere) generalized exponential function. Also a\n\u03c8 : q \u2194 2\u2212q\n\n(2.5)\n\ncorrespondence between the two always positive (Fig.1 \u2194 Fig.2) and the two sign-changing (Fig.3 \u2194\nFig.4) generalized exponentials is established. These are reminiscent of the q \u2194 1q and q \u2194 2 \u2212 q\ndualities first noted by Tsallis, Mendes and Platino (8) (and further investigated by Naudts(9), Abe and\nOkomoto(10), Frank and Plastino(11) and others), and acquire here a new meaning.\nThen it is quite natural to search for the bijections between Fig.1\u2194Fig.3 and Fig.2\u2194Fig.4 (i.e.\nbetween the sign-changing and the always positive generalized exponentials). These are given by the\n1\ncorrespondence (Fig.3 \u2192 Fig.1 and Fig.4 \u2192 Fig.2), and \u03c6 : q \u2192 2 \u2212 q1 (Fig.1 \u2192 Fig.3 and\n\u03c6 : q \u2192 2\u2212q\nFig.2 \u2192 Fig.4).\nAll these are correspondences which have their roots in in the complex coniugate z = z, z \u2208 C.\nHowever, the \u03c0 and \u03c8 transformations are involutions, while \u03c6 and \u03c6 are clearly not. \u03c0 and \u03c8 appear\nto be more fundamental in the sense that \u03c6 and \u03c6 are a composition of the first two. One can of course\nconstruct an infinite number of correspondences between the discrete spectra but only as compositions\nof these. And another decisive difference is that these represent a transformation between a q > 1 and\nq < 1 statistics, while \u03c6 and \u03c6 always map on the same q < 1 or q > 1 statistics.\nPutting all this together we can finally say that two possibilities exist.\n1\n1) eq [x] = a(x, q)b(q) = [1+1(1\u2212q)x] 1\u2212q is real and positive on all the domain interval Ix = [x1 , x2 ] \u2208 R\nfor the continuous parameter spectrum q \u2208 Iqcont = [q1 , q2 ], where Ix and Iqcont are determined by the set\nof\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f1\n1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2264 1 + x \u2200 x> 0\n\uf8f4 \u2265 q\u22121 \u2200 q < 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2265 1 + x \u2200 x< 0\n\uf8f2 \u2264 q\u22121 \u2200 q > 0\nq\nand\nx\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+\n+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif x = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 < +\u221e\n\uf8f4 < +\u221e if q = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 > \u2212\u221e\n\uf8f3\n\u2212\nif x = 0\n> \u2212\u221e if q = 1\u2212\n2) The generalized exponential can still be real on the entire domain Ix also outside Iqcont , but only\nfor a discrete parameter spectrum Iqdis = {q(k)} with\nq(k) =\n\nk\u22121\n\u2208 [0, 2]/Iqcont ;\nk\n\n(k \u2208 Z/{0}) ,\n\n1\nwhere eq(k) [x] = (1 + kx )k remains always positive for k even, but changes sign in x\u2217 = q\u22121\n= \u2212k, if k is\nodd.\nCases of particular interest where one might need to know where eq [x] is non complex on all Ix are\nfor instance\n\nIx =] \u2212 \u221e, 0] = R\u2212 \u21d2 eq [x] \u2208 R \u21d4\nq\u2208\n\nIqcont\n\n= [1, +\u221e[\n\nor\n\nq(k) \u2208\n\nIqdis\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\nk\u22121\n; k \u2208 Z+ /{0}\nk\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2208 [0, 1[\n\n(2.6)\n\nIx = [0, +\u221e[= R+ \u21d2 eq [x] \u2208 R \u21d4\nq \u2208 Iqcont =] \u2212 \u221e, 1]\n\nor\n\nq(k) \u2208 Iqdis =\n4\n\n\u001a\n\nk\u22121\n; k \u2208 Z\u2212 /{0}\nk\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2208]1, 2]\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fIx =] \u2212 \u221e, +\u221e[= R \u21d2 eq [x] \u2208 R \u21d4\nq \u2208 Iqcont = {1}\n\nor\n\nq(k) \u2208 Iqdis = {\n\nk\u22121\n; k \u2208 Z/{0}} \u2208 [0, 2]/{1}\nk\n\n(2.8)\n\nWhen the k-values over the discrete spectrum are even, then we are restricting on eq [x] \u2208 R+ .\nIn general, expanding the dominion Ix \u2208 R for which we require eq [x] to be real means expanding the\ndiscrete spectrum while reducing the continuous one, and viceversa. Moreover, for every q \u2208 Iqdis then\n1\ncont\n, but in general not always the viceversa is true. In any case this holds always for some q's\nq \u2208 Iq\nbetween a 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 statistics and a 12 \u2264 q \u2264 1 statistics.\nFrom case (2.8) we see that if we want a generalized exponential to be real on all the real dominion\nonly discrete values for q are allowed because the continuous spectrum reduces to a single element, i.e.\nq = 1. With this, one incidentally discovers that the known sequence which leads to the good old Euler\nfunction\n\u0010\nx \u0011k\n= e\u00b1x ,\nlim eq(k) [x] = lim 1 +\nk\u2192\u00b1\u221e\nk\u2192\u00b1\u221e\nk\n\nhas its origin and interpretation as the limit of the sequence of discrete spectrum generalized exponentials,\ni.e. the limiting case (converging to the accumulation point in q = 1) of the generalized exponentials\nwhich are real on all R.\nSo far we were concerned with things from a purely analytic point of view. We can now direct our\nattention to generalized exponentials in the frame of entropies and microcanonical probabilities.\n\n3\n\nThe discrete q-deforming spectrum for real and positive MEPDs\nand entropies\n\nIn statistical physics entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the phase space volume (\u0393-space) of the\nentire system\nS = log \u0393 .\nIn order to show that what we are trying to do has a validity which goes beyond Tsallis' entropy, we\nkeep very general to any form of entropy measures which lead to q-exponential MEPDs. These are all\nthose measures where one extends from Napier's logarithm to a second parameter r-generalized logarithm\nfunction as follows2\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n! 1\u2212r\n1\u2212q\nX\n1 \uf8f0\npiq\n\u2212 1\uf8fb ,\n(3.1)\nSSM = logr \u0393(P, q) = logr eSq T =\n1\u2212r\ni\n\nwhere\n\n\u0393(P, q) =\n\nX\n\npqi\n\ni\n\nand\n\nST =\n\n1\n! 1\u2212q\n\n= eSq T ,\n\nP\n\npqi \u2212 1\n,\n1\u2212q\ni\n\nis Tsallis' entropy (1). For r = q one obtains Tsallis entropy, if r = 1 we have\nSR = log \u0393(P, q) =\n\nX q\n1\npi ,\nlog\n1\u2212q\ni\n\n2 This is of course a somewhat heuristic development for an entropy generalization, but it is sufficient for our purposes.\nFor a more rigorous explanation of all that see also (11) and (12).\n\n5\n\n\fwhich is Renyi's entropy (2), while in general 3.1 can be recognized as the less known entropy of B.D\nSharma and D.P Mittal (13). It can be shown that 3.1 is the most general pseudo-additive measure\nwhich includes Tsallis' and Renyi entropies based on escort averages statistics admitting of a partition\nfunction((14), (11)). This \"logr \u00d7 expq \"-form representation will later make it easier to recognize the\nq-spectrum of \u0393(P, q).\nNow, one can check (1) with the method of the Lagrangian multipliers that, applying Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, the generalized MEPDs are (lets label with pbi the stationary PDs of family\nPb )3\neq [\u2212\u03b2g (Ei \u2212 U )]\n,\n(3.2)\npbi =\nZ(Pb )\nwith\n\nZ(Pb) =\n\nX\n\neq [\u2212\u03b2g (Ej \u2212 U )]\n\nj\n\na generalized partition function, where Ej is the j-th energy microstate, U the mean energy of the\nsystem and \u03b2g the generalized Lagrangian parameter (the inverse temperature in BG-statistics). The\nr-parameter gets absorbed in \u03b2g .\nIt might be useful to recall that expressions like that in 3.2 are invariant under the choice of the mean\nenergy U . Because of 2.3, one can rewrite it as\n\u0002\n\u0003\neq \u2212\u03b2 g Ei\n(3.3)\npbi =\nZ(Pb)\n\nwith\n\nZ(Pb) =\n\nand\n\nX\nj\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ(Pb )\neq \u2212\u03b2 g Ej =\n,\neq [\u03b2g U ]\n\n\u03b2 g = \u03b2g\n\n1\n.\n1 + (1 \u2212 q)\u03b2g U\n\nAs we have seen (and tried to depict in the figures in the appendix), the transformations of the\ndeforming parameter (2.4) and (2.5) establish a relationship between the discrete generalized exponentials\nwhich are (positively or negatively) real. MEPDs 3.2 are in form of generalized exponentials and must\ntherefore have for every parameter q their real dominion. (3.3) is especially useful to evaluate for which\nvalues of q the microstate probabilities, pbi , with no energy cut-off, are always real and positive. If we\nconsider \u03b2 g being positive, then we are dealing with the case (2.6)4 and must conclude that if we want the\ngeneralized optimized PDs to have statistical and physical significance, i.e. to be real and positive on all\nR\u2212 (k even), then we are forced to restrict our choice to a continuous parameter spectrum Iqcont = {q \u2265 1}\nor on a discrete parameter spectrum\n\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\n2l \u2212 1\n1 3 5\ndis\nIq =\n; l \u2208 N/{0} =\n, , , ..., 1 .\n2l\n2 4 6\nOn the other side consider the q-generalized \u0393-space of the entropy in its \"logr \u00d7 expq \"-form, \u0393 = eqST .\nAlso the phase space volume and Tsallis' entropy are supposed to be a statistical meaningful physical\nquantity only if they are real and positive. If no cut-off is imposed on the entropy and since ST \u2208 R+ ,\nthen case (2.7) determines the q\u2212spectrum as Iqcont = {q \u2264 1} and\nIqdis =\n\n\u001a\n\n2l \u2212 1\n; l \u2208 Z\u2212 /{0}\n2l\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n7 5 3\n.\n1, ..., , ,\n6 4 2\n\n3 We did obtain the MEPDs not only for Tsallis' entropy, as indicated in the reference, but for a more general set of\nentropies. The analytic procedure of maximization is of course equivalent.\n4 The case for \u03b2 < 0 is 2.7 and is more delicate since it implies negative temperatures if one considers the lagrangian pag\nrameter proportional to an inverse temperature. We will not consider the physical implications of this here, but analytically\none proceeds in the same way.\n\n6\n\n\fPutting this together, we can say that any physically meaningful generalized q-exponential statistics\nbased on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle (i.e. with entropies and the associated MEPD's as real\nand positive scalars) with no cut-off prescriptions must be restricted to case (2.8) and the q-deforming\nspectrum can have only discrete values\n\u001b\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001a\n7 5 3\n1 3 5\n2l \u2212 1\ndis\n,\n(3.4)\n; l \u2208 Z/{0} =\n, , , ..., 1, ..., , ,\nIq =\n2l\n2 4 6\n6 4 2\nwith q = 1 a point of accumulation.\nThis was a strictly formal treatment and in the frame of a thermostatistical reasoning this does of\ncourse not show that nature chooses just the values for q of (3.4). But if so, also the energy states\nof systems described by this statistics must be discrete. Since, in some physical systems, there are\nno physical reasons to introduce a priori energy cut-offs, one can conjecture that these parameters\nmight be preferred over others. This might give also a hint for further experimental work that tries to\nhighlight if nature indeed prefers to be described by general exponentials or not. Because the necessity\nto introduce cut-offs can also suggest that the generalized exponential function is not the correct, or only\nan approximate form to describe an extended statistics. Empiric evidence is to our knowledge so far\nstill affected by too much incertitude. However, the best experimental and statistical measurement we\nare aware of might be the work of Silva, Alcaniz and Lima (15) with plasma oscillation data who claim\nto have obtained a value of q = 0.77 \u00b1 0.03 at 95% confidence level. This would be in line with our\nvalue q(k = 4) = q(l = 2) = 43 . Of course only further experimental evidence can confirm or dismiss this\nhypothesis.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe studied the q-parameter (continuous and discrete) spectrum on which a generalized exponential\nis real and positive and concluded that assuming that Jaynes' maximum entropy principle holds also\nin a generalized q-statistics, if we want to have physically meaningful real and positive MEPDs and\nentropy scalars on an energy range without cut-off prescriptions, then only discrete parameters q \u2208 [ 12 , 32 ]\nare allowed. This does not mean that a q-statistics with different values than those given in 3.4 isn't\npossible, but then the introduction of limited energy ranges or the redefinition of a new q-generalized\nexponential is inescapable.\n\n7\n\n\fAppendix\nGraphs and relationships between the discrete generalized exponentials\n\neq @xD\n\neq @xD\n\n200\n30\n20\n100\n10\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx\n\n-10\n-100\n-20\n-30\n-200\nFig.1 q = { 12 , 34 , 65 , 78 ,\n\nq\u2192\n\n9 11\n, }\n10 12\n\nFig.2 q = { 13\n,\n12\n\n11 9 7 5 3\n, , , , }\n10 8 6 4 2\n\n\u2732\u271f\n\u272f\n\u2768\n\u274d\u271b\n\u274d\u274d\nq \u21942\u2212q\n\u271f\u271f\n\u274d\u274d\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u271f\u271f\n\u274d\u274d\n\u271f\u271f\n\u274d\u274d\n\u271f\u271f\nq \u2192 2 \u2212 1q\nq \u2192 2 \u2212 q1\n\u271f\n\u274d\n\u271f\u274d\nq\u2192\n\u271f\u271f q \u2194 q1 \u274d\u274d\n\u271f\n\u274d\n\u274d\u274d\n\u271f\u271f\n\u274d\u274d \u2744\n\u2744 \u271f\u271f\n\u271f\u271b\n\u2732\u274d\n\u2719\n\u271f\n\u2765\n\u274d\n\n1\n2\u2212q\n\n1\n2\u2212q\n\nq \u21942\u2212q\n\neq @xD\n\neq @xD\n\n200\n30\n20\n100\n10\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\nx\n\n-10\n-100\n-20\n-30\n-200\nFig.3 q = {0, 32 , 54 , 67 , 89 ,\n\n10 12\n, }\n11 13\n\nFig.4 q = { 12\n,\n11\n\n10 8 6 4\n, , , , 2}\n9 7 5 3\n\nNote: the q < 1 and q > 1 cases are displayed with different scales in order to convey a qualitative understanding.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.
