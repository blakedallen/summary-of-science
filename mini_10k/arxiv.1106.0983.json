RAHM\n\narXiv:1106.0983v3 [math.KT] 21 Dec 2013\n\n(communicated by James D. Stasheff)\nAbstract\nWe examine the topological characteristic cohomology classes of\ncomplexified vector bundles. In particular, all the classes coming from\nthe real vector bundles underlying the complexification are determined.\nThis article is dedicated to Mark F. Feshbach (1950-2010), for his\nvaluable work on cohomology rings of classifying spaces.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction and statement of the results\n\nIn the theory of characteristic classes (in the sense of Milnor and Stasheff [4], whom we\nfollow in terminology and notation in this article), it is well-known how the Chern classes\nare mapped to even Stiefel-Whitney classes when converting complex vector space bundles\nto real vector space bundles by forgetting the complex structure. In the other direction, we\nhave the fibre-wise complexification: Given a real vector bundle F \u2192 B with fibre Rn , its\ncomplexification is the complex vector bundle F C := F \u2297R C \u2192 B obtained by declaring\ncomplex multiplication on F \u2295F in each fibre Rn \u2295Rn by i(x, y) := (\u2212y, x) for the imaginary\nunit i. The Pontrjagin classes of a real vector bundle are (up to a sign) constructed as\nChern classes of its complexification. Conversely, which classes of a real vector bundle can\nbe attributed to its complexification? These are the complexifiable characteristic classes\nwhich we determine in this article, under the request that they are characteristic classes in\nthe sense of [4].\nConsider a real vector bundle F \u2192 B and a complex vector bundle E \u2192 B over the same\nparacompact Hausdorff base space B (we keep the latter assumption on B throughout this\narticle).\nDefinition 1. A real vector bundle F is called a real generator bundle of E, if its complexification F C is isomorphic to E. In the case that such a bundle F exists, we call E\nreal-generated.\nNot every complex vector bundle is real-generated; as the odd degree Chern classes have\nthe property c2k+1 (E) = \u2212c2k+1 (E) on the complex conjugate bundle E, it is an easy exercise to show that no complex vector bundle with some nonzero and non-2-torsion odd Chern\nclass can admit a real generator bundle. This makes it seem possible that the subcategory\nFunded by the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.\nReceived July 14, 2012, revised October 11, 2018; published on Month Day, Year.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 55R40, Homology of classifying spaces, characteristic classes.\nKey words and phrases: Characteristic classes, Classifying spaces of groups and H-spaces, Stable classes of\nvector space bundles.\nc 2013, Alexander D.

However, we will see that the\nChern classes already contain all of the relevant information.\nDefinition 2. A characteristic class c of real vector bundles is complexifiable if for all\npairs (F , G) of real vector bundles with isomorphic complexification F C \u223c\n= GC , the identity\nc(F ) = c(G) holds.\nWe will now give a complete classification of the complexifiable characteristic classes.\nDenote by Z2 := Z/2Z the group with two elements.\nTheorem 1. Let c be a polynomial in the Stiefel-Whitney classes wi , i \u2208 N \u222a {0}. Then\nthe following two conditions are equivalent:\n(i) The class c is an element of the sub-ring Z2 [wi2 ]i\u2208N\u222a{0} of the polynomials in the\nStiefel-Whitney classes.\n(ii) The class c is complexifiable.\nThe implication (i)\u21d2(ii) follows easily from the fact that the square of the n-th StiefelWhitney class of a real vector bundle is the mod-2-reduction of the n-th Chern class of the\ncomplexified vector bundle. The proof of the implication (ii)\u21d2(i) is prepared with several\nintermediary steps leading to it. One ingredient, Lemma 1, follows essentially from work of\nCartan on fibrations of H-spaces (at Cartan's time called Hopf spaces). But this only allows\nus to show that complexifiable characteristic classes in cohomology with Z2 \u2013coefficients are\ncontained in the ideal generated by the squares of the Stiefel-Whitney classes. To show that\nthey constitute exactly the subring generated by the squares of the Stiefel-Whitney classes,\nwhich is much smaller, we need the technical decomposition of Lemma 2 that we prove by\ninduction.\nBy their naturality, characteristic classes are uniquely determined on the universal bundle\nover the classifying space (BO for real vector bundles). As the cohomology ring H\u2217 (BO, Z2 )\nis generated by the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the universal bundle, all modulo 2 characteristic classes are polynomials in the Stiefel-Whitney classes, and Theorem 1 tells us which of\nthem are complexifiable.\nWe build on this result to investigate which integral cohomology classes are complexifiable. To express our result, we use Feshbach's description [3] of the cohomology ring\nof the classifying space BO with Z\u2013coefficients. Generators for this ring are known since\nThomas [5], [6], and all the relations between its generators are known since Brown [1]\nand Feshbach [3]. Consider the Steenrod squaring operation Sq 1 and the mod\u20132\u2013reduction\nhomomorphism\n\u03c1 : H\u2217 (BO, Z) \u2192 H\u2217 (BO, Z2 ).\nAs generators for H\u2217 (BO, Z), Feshbach uses\n\b Pontrjagin classes and classes VI with index\nsets I that are finite nonempty subsets of 12 \u222a N, admitting mod\u20132\u2013reductions\n!\n[\n\u03c1(VI ) = Sq 1\n\u03c92i ,\ni \u2208 I\n\nwhere \u03c9i is the i-th Stiefel Whitney class of the universal bundle over BO. In particular,\nwe have a generator V{ 21 } . We give the details of Feshbach's description in the appendix.\nOur final result now takes the following shape.\n\n\fJournal of Homotopy and Related Structures, vol. 1(1), 2013\n\n3\n\nTheorem 2. Let C be a polynomial in VI2 , with I arbitrary, V{ 21 } and the Pontrjagin\nclasses. Then C is complexifiable.\nAnd conversely, we can say the following.\nTheorem 3. Let C be a complexifiable integral characteristic class. Then for any real vector\nbundle \u03be, C(\u03be) is completely determined by some Chern classes ck (\u03be C ), k \u2208 N.\n\n2.\n\nClasses in cohomology with Z2 \u2013coefficients\n\nIn this section, we shall prove Theorem 1, after developing all the tools we need to do\nso. For this entire section, we only consider cohomology with Z2 \u2013coefficients. We write N\nfor the natural numbers without 0.\nLet F \u2192 B be a real vector bundle over a paracompact Hausdorff base space. Let c be a\ncomplexifiable polynomial in the Stiefel-Whitney classes wi . Let O be the direct limit of\nthe orthogonal groups, U the direct limit of the unitary groups and EU the universal total\nspace to the classifying space BU for stable complex vector bundles. Let BO := EU/O, via\nthe inclusion O \u2282 U induced by the canonical inclusion R \u2282 C. Let \u03b3(R\u221e ) be the universal\nbundle over BO, and denote its Stiefel-Whitney classes by \u03c9i := wi (\u03b3(R\u221e )). Let \u03b5 be the\ntrivial vector bundle.\nLemma 1. Let c be a complexifiable class in cohomology with Z2 \u2013coefficients.\nThen c(\u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(\u03b5) is contained in the ideal h\u03c9i2 ii \u2208 N .\nProof. We use Cartan's fibration of H-spaces [2, p. 17-22] (fibration en espaces de Hopf),\nU/O\n\nf\n\n/ BO\n\np\n\n/ / BU.\n\nThe cohomology ring H\u2217 (BO, Z2 ) is the polynomial algebra Z2 [\u03c91 , \u03c92 , ...] with generators\nthe Stiefel-Whitney classes of the universal bundle. Cartan [2, p. 17-22] has shown that f \u2217\nmaps these generators \u03c9i to the generators \u03bdi := wi (f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e )) of the exterior algebra\n^\nH\u2217 (U/O, Z2 ) = (Z2 [\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , ...]),\n\nwhich is obtained by dividing out the ideal h\u03bdi2 ii \u2208 N of the polynomial algebra Z2 [\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , ...].\nHence, exactly the ideal h\u03c9i2 ii \u2208 N is mapped to zero. So,\nh\u03c9i2 ii \u2208 N = ker f \u2217 .\n\nComposing f with the projection p : BO \u2192 BU , we obtain a constant map and therefore a trivial bundle (p \u25e6 f )\u2217 \u03b3(C\u221e ). This pullback of the complex universal bundle is the\ncomplexification of f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e ):\n(p \u25e6 f )\u2217 \u03b3(C\u221e ) = f \u2217 p\u2217 EU \u00d7U C\u221e = f \u2217 EO \u00d7O C\u221e = f \u2217 (EO \u00d7O R\u221e )C\n= f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e )C = (f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e ))C .\nSo, f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e ) admits a trivial complexification, and all of the complexifiable classes c must\ntreat it like the trivial bundle \u03b5:\nc(f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e )) = c(\u03b5). A pullback of the trivial bundle is trivial too, so\n0 = c(f \u2217 \u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(f \u2217 \u03b5) = f \u2217 (c(\u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(\u03b5))\n\n\fJournal of Homotopy and Related Structures, vol. 1(1), 2013\n\n4\n\nby naturality. Whence, c(\u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(\u03b5) is an element of the kernel of f \u2217 , which we have\nidentified with the ideal h\u03c9i2 ii \u2208 N .\nThe above lemma allows us to write the characteristic class c under investigation as a\nsum over products with squares of Stiefel-Whitney classes,\nc(\u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(\u03b5) =\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03c9i2j \u222a rj (\u03b3(R\u221e )),\n\nj=1\n\nwith rj some polynomials in the Stiefel-Whitney classes. We must inductively identify\nsquares of Stiefel-Whitney classes as factors of the remainders rj , until we achieve the\ndecomposition claimed in the following lemma.\nNotation.

We set ~j0 := 0.\nNote that the classes c(\u03b5), r~j (\u03b5) of the trivial bundle \u03b5 that we are going to use now, are\njust coefficients in H0 (BO, Z2 ) \u223c\n= {0, 1}.\nLemma 2.

Then, that lower degree remainder admits a decomposition as a linear combination\nof squares \u03c9i2~j with coefficients r~j2 (\u03b3(R\u221e )) in H\u2217 (BO, Z2 ), leading to a new decomposition\n2\nof c(\u03b3(R\u221e )) \u2212 c(\u03b5).
