In addition to the usual \u22c6-product deformation of the algebra of\nfield functions, we show that the parameter of noncommutativity can occur in noncommutative field\ntheory even in the case of free fields without self-interacting potentials.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n1. Introduction\nParticle Quantum Mechanics can be viewed in the free field or weak coupling limit as a minisuperspace\nsector of quantum field theory where most of the degrees of freedom have been frozen. It is thus a\nvery convenient arena for further investigating the implications of the quantum mechanical spacetime\nnoncommutativity in the formulation of field theories, as well as for evaluating the justification of some\nstatements that are considered as generally accepted wisdom among practitioners of noncommutative\nfield theory. Cf e.g. [1] -[14] and references therein for related works, albeit in a somewhat different\nspirit from the problem considered here, on noncommutative quantum mechanics. Further, in [15]\nnoncommutativity was considered within the context of the Weyl-Wigner-Gr\u00f6enewold-Moyal (WWGM)\nformalism for extended Heisenberg algebras, and its relation to the Bopp shift map (or what some\nauthors refer to as the quantum mechanical equivalent of the Seiberg-Witten map) for expressing the\nalgebra of extended Heisenberg operators in terms of their commutative counterparts was discussed and\nresults were compared for problems previously studied in some of the above cited works. Moreover, the\ncanonical, noncanonical and the possible quantum mechanical nonunitarity nature of some of these maps\nwas additionally analyzed in [16, 17]. The results found there are conceptually relevant to our approach\nhere, since as shown in several of the examples considered, transforming a problem in NCQM into a\ncommutative one does not always lead to two unitarily equivalent quantum mechanical formulations.\nA case in point, arises when we compare some of our results and their physical implications with\nthose obtained by the procedure followed in Ref [18]. The comparison is quite pertinent since both\napproaches are analogous in that they both have a quantum mechanical minisuperspace as a starting\npoint for a construction of a field theoretical model. Indeed, the original quantum Hamiltonian in [18],\nmodulo some irrelevant normalizations, is the same as the one considered here. On the other hand,\nthe extended original Heisenberg algebra used in that work (Eq(2.6)) is different from ours because the\nauthors there require to introduce (for their latter arguments) also noncommutativity of the momenta\noperators. Making then a linear transformation (actually a Bopp shift map) to a new set of quantum\nvariables which satisfies the usual Heisenberg algebra results in their new Hamiltonian (2.9). The\nremainder of the construction in [18] follows from the above. Note, however, that the two decoupled\nquantum oscillators obtained in that work are not the same as ours (to see this it suffices to set B\u0302 = 0,\nin their equations (2.10) and compare them with our equation (3.60)). Thus the quantum mechanical\nproblems implied by Eqs. (2.5) and (2.9) in [18] are not unitarily equivalent. In fact, the quantum\nmechanical problem that is actually considered there is that of a two dimensional anharmonic oscillator\nwith a particular choice of frequencies containing some constant terms labeled with the symbols \u03b8\u0302 and\nB\u0302, which can not truly be identified with the noncommutativity of any of the observables generated by\nthe Heisenberg algebra (2.8) characterizing the quantum problem that at the end of the day is involved\nin that work.\nMoreover, the field constructed in [18] is a complex scalar field, which is not so in our case, and the\nFeynman propagator derived there and given in Eq(3.5) is quite different from ours (cf Eq(4.66)). The\nmost important difference being that (3.5) in Ref [18] satisfies a highly non-local differential equation\nwhich violates both ordinary as well as twisted Poincar\u00e9 invariance, while the symmetries of the Feynman\npropagator we derive in this work are in agreement with recent results on twisted NCQFT.\nBased on the above remarks and recalling that observables in quantum mechanics are represented\nby Hermitian operators acting on a Hilbert space, noncommutativity of the dynamical variables of a\nquantum mechanical system can be readily understood as the noncommutativity of their corresponding\noperators. In this way the physical argument that measurements below distances of the order of the\n\n\f3\n\nPlanck length loose operational significance [19], can be mathematically described by extending the\nusual Heisenberg algebra of ordinary quantum mechanics to one including the noncommutativity of the\noperators related to the spacetime dynamical variables. Consistently in this paper we shall therefore\nuse a quantum basis which is fully compatible with the noncommutativity of the coordinates.\nIn particular in order to formulate space noncommutativity in Quantum Mechanics we use the\nextended Heisenberg algebra with generators satisfying the commutation relations\ni\nh\n= i\u03b8ij ,\nQ\u0302i , Q\u0302j\ni\nh\n(1.1)\n= i~\u03b4ij ,\nQ\u0302i , P\u0302j\nh\ni\nP\u0302i , P\u0302j\n= 0,\n(these could of course be generalized even more by also postulating noncommutativity of the momenta).\nThe parameters \u03b8ij of noncommutativity in (1.1) have dimensions of (length)2 and can, in general, be\nthemselves arbitrary antisymmetric functions of the spacetime operators. However, most of the work\nso far appearing in the literature assumes for simplicity that these parameters are constant, and so\nshall we in what follows. The observables formed from the generators in (1.1) act on a Hilbert space\nwhich is assumed to be the same as the one for ordinary quantum mechanics, for any of the admissible\nrealizations of the extended noncommutative Heisenberg algebra.\nFurthermore, utilizing the WWGM formalism for a quantum mechanical system, with observables\nobeying the above extended Heisenberg algebra, we showed in a previous paper [17] that the Weyl\nequivalent to a Heisenberg operator \u03a9(P\u0302, Q\u0302, t) satisfies the differential equation\n\n(1.2)\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\n\u2202\u03a9W (p, q, t)\n2\n1\n= \u2212 HW sin \uf8f0 (~\u039b +\n\u03b8ij \u039b\u2032ij )\uf8fb \u03a9W (p, q, t),\n\u2202t\n~\n2\ni6=j\n\nwhere\n\n\u039b =\n(1.3)\n\n\u039b\u2032ij\n\n=\n\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2207 q * \u2207 p \u2212 \u2207 p * \u2207 q,\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2202 qi \u2202 qj ,\n\nand HW is the Weyl equivalent to the quantum Hamiltonian.\nMaking use of (1.2) we further showed in [17] that in the WWGM formalism of quantum mechanics,\nthe labeling variables q, p, can be interpreted as canonical classical dynamical variables provided their\nalgebra A is modified with a multiplication given by the star-product:\n\u0010 1P\n\u2212 \u0011\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2192\n(1.4)\nqi \u22c6\u03b8 qj := qi e 2 k,l \u03b8kl \u2202 qk \u2202 ql qj .\n\nApplying these results to the simple case of a two dimensional harmonic oscillator satisfying the algebra\n(1.1), which is taken as the unfrozen mode, or the one particle sector of a two-component vector (or\ncomposite system) field, and using spectral analysis in order to reconstruct the corresponding quantum\nfield, we shall show how the parameter of the quantum mechanical noncommutativity appears in the\ntheory even for the case of a free field. This novel result, which as we shall see is a quite natural\nconsequence of our approach, and contrasts with the usually made assumption that the presence of\nnoncommutativity in field theory is manifested only through the deformation of the multiplication in\nthe algebra of the fields [20], [21], [22].\n\n\f4\n\n2. The quantum mechanics of the harmonic oscillator in noncommutative space\nAs discussed in [17], a configuration space basis for the quantum mechanics with an extended Heisenberg algebra generated by (1.1) is not an admissible basis, since the position operators Q\u0302i , Q\u0302j , i 6= j, do\nnot simultaneously form part of a complete set of commuting observables.

Field theoretical model\nParalleling standard quantum field theory we next construct a noncommutative field theory over a\n(1 + 2)-Minkowski space by taking an infinite superposition of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator minisuperspaces described by (2.40). Each of these oscillators consists of the pair x1 (k), x2 (k),\nlabeled by the continuous parameter k and satisfying (2.41). Thus in our construction, the quantum\nmechanical spacial noncommutativity will reflect itself both in the deformation parameter dependence\nof the different frequencies of the pairs of oscillators, as well as in the twisting of the product of the\nalgebra of the resulting fields. Consequently this simple model shows that spacetime noncommutativity\ncan be present in field theory even in the absence of self-interaction potentials.\nLet us consider a field system \u03a6i (q, t), i = 1, 2, over a (1 + 2)-Minkowski space-time, satisfying the\nuncoupled Klein-Gordon field equations\n!\n!\n\u03a61 (q1 , q2 , t)\n\u00032 + \u03bc21\n0\n= 0,\n(3.45)\n\u03a62 (q1 , q2 , t)\n0\n\u00032 + \u03bc22\nwhere\n(3.46)\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03a6i (q, t) = (2\u03c0)\n\nand\n\nZ\n\ndk xi (k, t) eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 ,\n\n1\neik.q\n:= 1 + ik.q + (ik.q) \u22c6\u03b8 (ik.q) + . . . .\n\u22c6\u03b8\n2\nNote that in the above definition of the field system in terms of its Fourier transform we have used the\nstar-exponential for describing plane waves. Our rationale for this is based on the observation made in\n([15]) where, by making use of the WWGM formalism and elements of quantum group theory, we show\nthat quantum noncommutativity of coordinate operators in the extended Heisenberg algebra leads to\na deformed product of the classical dynamical variables that is inherited to the level of quantum field\ntheory. This deformed product is the so called Moyal star-product defined in (1.4). Thus, expressing\nthe fields as in (3.46) guarantees explicitly that they are elements of the deformed algebra A\u03b8 with the\n\u22c6-multiplication.\n(3.47)\n\nNote also that in (3.45) the D'Alembertian is given by\n\u00032 = \u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202 \u0304i\u2020 \u2202 \u0304i ,\n\n(3.48)\n\nwith the anti-hermitian derivation \u2202 \u0304i defined by [28]:\n(3.49)\n\n\u22121\n\u2202 \u0304i = \u03b8ij\nadqj , and \u2202 \u0304i\u2020 = \u2212\u2202 \u0304i , i = 1, 2,\n\nand where the adjoint action is realized by the twisted product commutator\n(3.50)\n\n[qi , qj ]\u22c6\u03b8 := qi \u22c6\u03b8 qj \u2212 qj \u22c6\u03b8 qi .\n\nThus, the algebra (1.4) has been incorporated into (3.45) through the defining Fourier transformation\nequation (3.46) for the fields since these, as functions of the qi 's, they inherit the \u22c6-multiplication and\nare therefore also elements of the twisted algebra A\u03b8 .\nNow, by making use of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff theorem, together with the commutator (3.50)\n(n\u22121)\nas well as of the identity [q2 , q1n ]\u22c6\u03b8 = \u2212in\u03b8q1\n, we have that\n\u2202 \u03041 (eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 ) =\n\n(3.51)\n\n=\n\ni\n\n\u03b8\u22121 [q2 , eik1 q1 eik2 q2 e 2 k1 k2 \u03b8 ]\u22c6\u03b8\nk1 eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 ,\n\n\f9\n\nand (recalling that \u2202 \u0304i\u2020 = \u2212\u2202 \u0304i )\n2 ik.q\n\u2202 \u03041\u2020 \u2202 \u03041 (eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 ) = \u2212k1 e\u22c6\u03b8 .\n\n(3.52)\nSimilarly\n\n2 ik.q\n\u2202 \u03042\u2020 \u2202 \u03042 (eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 ) = \u2212k2 e\u22c6\u03b8 .\n\n(3.53)\n\nWe therefore find that the field equations (3.45) read\nZ\n(3.54)\n(\u00032 + \u03bc2i )\u03a6i (q, t) = (2\u03c0)\u22121 dk[\u1e8di + (k2 + \u03bc2i )xi ]eik.q\n\u22c6\u03b8 = 0, i = 1, 2.\nUsing next the orthonormality\n(3.55)\n\n(2\u03c0)\u22122\n\nZ Z\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212ik .q\ndq1 dq2 eik.q\n= \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n\u22c6\u03b8 e \u22c6\u03b8\n\nand the dispersion relation\n(3.56)\n\nk2 + \u03bc2i = k02 = \u03c9i2 (k),\n\nwe obtain from the right hand of (3.54):\n(3.57)\n\n\u1e8di (k, t) + \u03c9i2 (k)xi (k, t) = 0.\n\nObserve that \u03c9i (k), i = 1, 2, in (3.56) is given by (2.24) with \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9(k) and \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8(k) being now\nrespectively the wave vector dependent frequency in (1.1) and the noncommutative parameter of the\nquantum mechanical system for each k in the spectral decomposition (3.46). Comparing (3.57) with\n~\u03b8\u0303\n(2.41), and observing that according to our definition (2.27) we now have \u03b8(k) = m\u03c9(k)\n, we choose\n\u03b8(k) such that \u03b8\u0303 remains a pure number independent of k.

Path integral and Feynman propagator\nIn order to derive the Feynman propagator for our theory, we use (3.46) and a similar expression for\nthe Fourier transform F\u0303i of the sources Ji together with (3.55), as well as the transformations\nZ\n\u2212 12\nxi ((k, t) = (2\u03c0)\ndk0 eik0 t x\u0303i (k, k0 ),\nZ\n1\n(4.61)\ndk0 eik0 t F\u0303i (k, k0 ).\nFi ((k, t) = (2\u03c0)\u2212 2\nWe thus get\n\nS=\n(4.62)\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8eb\n\ndk0 dk \uf8f0(k02 \u2212 k2 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) \uf8ed\n\nX\n\ni=1,2\n\n\uf8f6\n\nx\u0303i (k, k0 )x\u0303i (k, \u2212k0 )\uf8f8\n\n+ x\u03031 (k, k0 )F\u03031 (k, \u2212k0 ) + x\u03031 (k, \u2212k0 )F\u03031 (k, k0 )\ni\n+ x\u03032 (k, k0 )F\u03032 (k, \u2212k0 ) + x\u03032 (k, \u2212k0 )F\u03032 (k, k0 ) .\n\nFollowing standard procedures (see e.g. [29]), we now make the change of variables\n\n(4.63)\n\nx\u03031 (k, k0 ) =\n\nZ1 (k, k0 ) + \u03b2(k0 )F\u03031 (k, k0 ) + \u03b3(k0 )F2 (k, k0 ),\n\nx\u03032 (k, k0 ) =\n\nZ2 (k, k0 ) + \u03bb(k0 )F\u03031 (k, k0 ) + \u03bd(k0 )F2 (k, k0 ).\n\nInserting (4.63) into (4.62) and requiring that terms linear in the Zi 's cancel, allows us to fix the\nparameters \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bb, \u03bd as:\n\n(4.64)\n\n\u03b2(k0 ) =\n\n(k02 \u2212 k2 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\u22121 ,\n\n\u03bb(k0 ) =\n\n\u03b3(k0 ) = 0,\n\n\u03bd(k0 ) =\n\n\u2212(k02 \u2212 k2 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\nIf we next replace (4.64) into the action resulting from (4.62) by the above procedure, we derive the\nfollowing contribution to the integrand in that action from the terms quadratic in the sources:\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n. . . dq dq\u2032 dt dt\u2032 J1\u2020 (q, t) J2\u2020 (q, t)\nhZ0 [J]i := \u2212\n2\n!\n!\n(4.65)\nJ1 (q\u2032 , t\u2032 )\nD1 (q \u2212 q\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n0\n,\n\u00d7\nJ2 (q\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n0\nD2 (q \u2212 q\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )\nwhere Di (q \u2212 q\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 ) are the Feynman propagators:\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22123\n(4.66)\nDi (q \u2212 q , t \u2212 t ) = (2\u03c0)\n. . . dk dk0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212i[k0 (t\u2212t )\u2212k.(q\u2212q )]\nk02 \u2212 \u03c9i2 (k) + i\u01eb\n\n!\n\n, i = 1, 2,\n\nand the \u03c9i2 (k) are given by (3.60).\nNote that these propagators satisfy the Klein-Gordon equations\n\u0001\n(4.67)\n\u00032 + \u03bc2i Di (q \u2212 q\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = \u2212\u03b4(q \u2212 q\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\nObserve also that (4.67) is invariant under the twisted Poincar\u00e9 transformations discussed in [30], since\nthe D'Alembertian, as defined in (3.48), is invariant under these transformations and the indices i = 1, 2,\nare not space-time indices.\nIn consequence of the above, the vacuum to vacuum amplitude for our theory is thus given by\n(4.68)\n\ni\n\nW [J] = W [0]e ~ hZ0 [J]i ,\n\n\f11\n(0)\n\nand the classical fields \u03a6(cl)i \u2261 \u2212i\n\n\u03b4 ln W0\n\u03b4Ji\u2020 (q,t)\n\n=\n\n\u03b4Z0\n\u03b4Ji\u2020 (q,t)\n\nsatisfy the driven Klein-Gordon field equations\n(0)\n\n(\u00032 + \u03bc2i )\u03a6(cl)i =\n\n(4.69)\n\n1\nJi .\n2\n\n5. Second Quantization\nLet us promote the xi in (3.46) to the rank of operators and, similarly to that equation, let us define\nfield canonical momenta by\nZ\n\u22121\n(5.70)\n\u03a0\u0302i = (2\u03c0)\ndk \u03c0\u0302i (k, t) e\u2212ik.q\n,\n\u22c6\u03b8\n\nwith x\u0302i , \u03c0\u0302j , satisfying now the commutation relations\n\n[x\u0302i (k, t), \u03c0\u0302j (k\u2032 , t)] =\n(5.71)\n\ni~\u03b4ij \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n\n[x\u0302i (k, t), x\u0302j (k\u2032 , t)] =\n\n0,\n\n[\u03c0\u0302i (k, t), \u03c0\u0302j (k\u2032 , t)] =\n\n0.\n\nAssuming further that \u03a6\u0302i and \u03a0\u0302i are real, we have by Hermicity that\n(5.72)\n\nx\u0302\u2020i (k, t) = x\u0302i (\u2212k, t),\n\n\u03c0\u0302i\u2020 (k, t) = \u03c0\u0302i (\u2212k, t),\n\nand we also take \u03c9i (k) = \u03c9i (\u2212k).\nNext let\ns\n\n\u0011\n~ \u0010\n\u00e2i (k, t) + \u00e2\u2020i (\u2212k, t) ,\n2\u03c9i (k)\nr\n\u0011\n~\u03c9i (k) \u0010 \u2020\n\u03c0\u0302i (k, t) = i\n(5.73)\n\u00e2i (k, t) \u2212 \u00e2i (\u2212k, t) .\n2\nIt readily follows from (5.73) and (5.71) that\nx\u0302i (k, t)\n\n=\n\n[\u00e2i (k, t), \u00e2\u2020j (k\u2032 , t)] = \u03b4ij \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n(5.74)\n\n[\u00e2i (k, t), \u00e2j (k\u2032 , t)] = 0,\n[\u00e2\u2020i (k, t), \u00e2\u2020j (k\u2032 , t)] = 0.\n\nSo \u00e2\u2020i and \u00e2i , are the usual Fock creation and destruction operators. Note however that while particleantiparticle degeneracy at the dispersion relation level is preserved for a given value of the label i = 1, 2,\nthe energies of the particles-antiparticles created (destroyed) by \u00e2\u2020i (\u00e2i ) are different and are given by ~\u03c9i .\n\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nSpacetime noncommutativity in field theory is understood in some circles as a merely convenient way\nto describe a special type of interaction. Such a description consisting in mathematically deforming\nthe product in the algebra of field functions by means of the so-called Moyal star-product. However, as\nwe tried to stress throughout the paper, referring to the formalism under such premises as spacetime\nnoncommutativity is, at best, a misnomer since the arguments of the fields are parameters of the theory.\nSpeaking about noncommutativity in this context then has little physical basis, beyond the rather loose\nanalogy of the Moyal product with the Groenewold- Moyal product occurring in the WWGM phasespace formulation of quantum mechanics. One of our contentions here has been, however, that there\nis more physical substance to that designation if one recalls the operational nature of observables in\n\n\f12\n\nquantum mechanics from where noncommutativity of the dynamical variables of the system is readily\nunderstood then as the noncommutatitivity of their corresponding operators. Furthermore, based on the\nconcept that quantum mechanics can be viewed as a minisuperspace sector of field theory, where only a\nfew degrees of freedom are unfrozen, we have used the quantum mechanics of a harmonic oscillator over\nan extended Heisenberg algebra, to construct a field theoretical model which inherits the space-space\nnoncommutativity of the quantum mechanical problem.\nAn interesting feature of our construction is that it shows that the global symmetry of the original\ntheory (2.5) is broken by the noncommutativity. This in turn implies that if at the level of field theory\nthe index tagging the fields denotes a composite system of scalar fields (and not the components of a\nvector field), then the noncommutativity can be seen as giving rise to a field doublet (or more generally\nan n-tuplet) of slightly different masses where classical Lorentz symmetry for each member is broken,\nbut each one satisfies a deformed Klein-Gordon equation which is invariant under a twisted Lorentz\nsymmetry. On the other hand, if the labeling of the fields is taken as corresponding to that of a vector\nfield of spacetime dimensions then, because of the mass differences, both classical and twisted Lorentz\ninvariance are broken by the noncommutativity.\nThis symmetry breaking and mass differences resulting from the presence of noncommutativity is in\nsome way reminiscent of the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism that occurs in the Standard\nModel, but without the appearance of a Goldstone boson.\nIn addition, by thinking of noncommutativity of spacetime as the quantum mechanical operator\nalgebra expressing the loss of operational meaning for localization at distances of orders smaller than\nthe Planck length, it then follows that minisuperspaces based on noncommutative spacetimes have to be\nat least of two dimensions, and the fields constructed from them must necessarily contain the presence\nof the parameter of noncommutativity even in the absence of self-interacting potentials.\nAn alternate way to mathematically express the physical argument that measurements below distances of the order of the Planck length loose operational significance, can be accomplished, both at\nthe quantum mechanical and field theoretical level, by using parametrization invariance of the action\nand following the canonical quantization approach of embedding a spatial manifold \u03a3 in the spacetime\nmanifold. Such an approach, whereby the embedding variables acquire a dynamical interpretation,\nwhich, in turn, gives physical sense to their noncommutativity and is achieved by the inclusion of a\ngeneral symplectic structure in the formalism, has been analyzed extensively by the authors elsewhere\n[31]. The deformed algebra of the constraints resulting from the parametrization and general symplectic structure of the theory is particularly convenient for analyzing the twisting of its symmetries and\nfor indeed thinking of a true physical spacetime noncommutativity as underlying the merely axiomatic\nmathematical deformation of the algebra product describing a certain type of interactions in field theory.\nFinally, we note that although our construction has been restricted for simplicity to two spacial\ndimensions and to bosonic fields, it can be generalized to allow for higher dimensional spaces in a\nconceptually straightforward (albeit algebraically more complicated) way, and to the case of fermionic\nfields by including Grassmanian variables in the construction of the spectral oscillators.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge partial support from CONACyT project UA7899-F (M.
