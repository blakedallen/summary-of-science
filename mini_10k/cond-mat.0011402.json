The answer seems to be no, and the effect depends sensitively on the details of the geometry and other\nphysical parameters of the problem.\n\nResearch on transport in mesoscopic open rings has\nprovided several counterintuitive results1\u201310 . The classic\nexample of one such result is the observation of normal\nstate Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect4 . Among other such\neffects in the context of mesoscopic systems, attention\nmay be drawn upon the current amplification effect in\nthe open ring system7,8 wherein a current flowing in the\nlead is amplified, after passage through the junction, in\none of the ring arms and appears as a negative current\nin the other ring arm. Like AB effect, this effect too\nis purely quantum mechanical in origin. This effect has\nbeen extended to thermal currents11 and to spin currents\nin the presence of Aharonov-Casher flux12 .\n\nIn the case of a mesoscopic loop with unequal arms\nconnected to two electron reservoirs at chemical potentials \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 via ideal leads currents Ilow and Iup flow\nin the lower and upper arm of the loop such that total\ncurrent I = Ilow + Iup is conserved in accordance with\nKirchoff's law. In general these two currents differ in\nmagnitude and are individually smaller than the total\ncurrent I. However, in certain range of Fermi energies\nthe current Ilow or Iup may become larger than the total\ncurrent I. This is the current magnification effect. To\nconserve the total current at the junctions, the current\nin the other arm becomes negative i.e., flows against the\napplied external field. This negative current continues\nto flow in the loop as a circulating current. The magnitude of the circulating current is the same as that of\nthe negative current. The circulating current here arises\nin the absence of magnetic field. The effect of a simple\nimpurity (an impurity without any internal structure) in\none arm of the ring on the current magnification property\nhas been studied earlier8 . It was found that the impurity could not only suppress but also enhance the current\nmagnification depending on the Fermi energy. Thus the\nimpurity plays a dual role as far as current magnification\nis concerned. The experimental possibility of the observation of this current magnification effect by looking at\nthe orbital magnetic response of the loop is mentioned in\nRefs. 7,8.\n\nRecently we have studied the effect of decoherence on\nAB oscillations in mesoscopic open ring13 . In the simple model that we consider, a magnetic impurity in one\narm of the ring is coupled via exchange interaction to the\nincoming electron. Though the interaction induces spinflip scattering there is no exchange of energy. This fact\nalong with entanglement14 shows that spin-flip scattering\narising due to exchange coupling with magnetic impurity\nreduces the AB oscillations and leads to decoherence13 .\nThe study of decoherence is important to understand\nthe evolution of quantum system towards a classical one\n(destruction of entanglement due to environment). It is\nworthwhile to note that coupling to a single impurity or\nsingle degree of freedom is enough to suppress the quantum effect1,15 . In our case the impurity does not dynamics of its own. Generally, it is believed that only coupling\nwith infinite degrees of freedom (a thermal bath) could\ninduce dephasing. We know that the current magnification effect, to be discussed below, is a quantum effect.\nHence one would like to study whether quantum entan-\n\nIn the following we study the current magnification effect in presence of a magnetic impurity in one arm of\n1\n\n\f\u03c82\u2032 (x = l2 ) + \u03c84\u2032 (x = l3 + l4 ) = \u03c85\u2032 (x = 0).\n\nthe ring. Consider a single channel loop of circumference\nL coupled to two electron reservoirs by two ideal leads\n(see Fig. 1). We introduce a magnetic impurity atom\n(referred to as spin-flipper, or the flipper, for short) in\none arm (upper) of the ring at length l3 from junction\nJ1 and l4 from J2. The lower arm is of length l2 and\nL = l2 + l3 + l4 . The spin of the electron (~\u03c3 ) is thus\n~ via the exchange\ncoupled to the spin of the flipper (S)\n~\ninteraction \u2212J~\u03c3 * S\u03b4(x \u2212 l3 ). This leads to scattering of\nthe electron in which both the spin states of the electron\nand the impurity could change without any exchange of\n~\nenergy. This interaction conserves the total spin (~\u03c3 + S)\nas well as the z-component of the total spin. The two\nreservoirs are kept at chemical potentials \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 respectively. When \u03bc1 is greater than \u03bc2 , a net current\nflows from reservoir 1 on the left to the reservoir 2 on the\nright. Details of the ring geometry with the impurity are\nindicated in Fig. 1.\nWe follow the standard quantum waveguide\ntheory6\u20138,16 to study this problem. The wavefunctions\n(\u03c8 \u2032 s) for the individual segments, as indicated in Fig. 1,\ncan be written as below\n\u03c81 = (eikx + ru e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m \u03b1 +\nrd e\u2212ikx \u03c7m+1 \u03b2,\n\u03c82 = (Au eikx + Bu e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m \u03b1 +\n(Ad eikx + Bd e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m+1 \u03b2,\n\u03c83 = (Cu eikx + Du e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m \u03b1 +\n(Cd eikx + Dd e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m+1 \u03b2,\n\u03c84 = (Eu eikx + Fu e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m \u03b1 +\n(Ed eikx + Fd e\u2212ikx )\u03c7m+1 \u03b2,\n\u03c85 = tu eikx \u03c7m \u03b1 + td eikx \u03c7m+1 \u03b2.\n\nHere G = 2mJ/h\u03042 is the dimensionless coupling constant indicative of the \"strength\" of the spin-exchange\ninteraction. The primes denote the spatial derivatives\nof the wave functions. Equations (1) along with the\nboundary conditions (2) were solved to obtain the amplitudes, with these we evaluate the current densities in\neach arm of the ring. We have taken the flipper to be\na spin-half object (M = 2) situated symmetrically at\nthe center of the upper arm, i.e., we consider the case\nin which l3 = l4 . Now, depending upon the initial state\nof the flipper we have possibility of either spin-flip scattering (\u03c3z = 1/2, Sz = \u22121/2) or no spin-flip scattering\n(\u03c3z = 1/2, Sz = 1/2), as demanded by the conservation of the total spin and its z-component. In the former\ncase the problem reduces to that of a simple potential\nscattering from the impurity as studied earlier8 .\nWe have set h\u0304 = m = 1 and the value of interaction\nstrength G is given in dimensionless units throughout.\nThe dimensionless current density I2 in the small energy\ninterval dE (see Refs. 7,8) flowing in lower arm of the ring\nis defined as I2 = I2u +I2d , wherein I2u = | Au |2 \u2212| Bu |2\n2\n2\nand I2d = | Ad | \u2212 | Bd | . The current densities I3 and\nI4 flowing in the upper arm are similarly defined. Current\nconservation at the impurity site demands I3 = I4 which\nwe have verified. The total current flowing through the\narms can be calculated by integrating the corresponding current densities over the Fermi energy interval \u03bc1\nto \u03bc2 7,8 . In the present work we confine ourselves to the\neffect of the flipper on the circulating current density Ic .\nWe have studied the behaviour of the current densities\nIlow = I2 and Iup = I3 in the lower and the upper arms\nof the ring, as a function of kL. In any range of Fermi energy, if any one of these is negative, the magnitude of the\nnegative current density can be identified with that of the\ncirculating current density7,8 Ic . When Ilow is negative\nthe direction of the circulating current density is clockwise and when Iup is negative then it is anti-clockwise. A\nclockwise circulating current density is taken to be positive and an anti-clockwise one, negative according to the\nusual convention. It has been seen earlier that there is\nan enhancement in current magnification in presence of\na simple impurity(no spin-flip)8 . In the following paragraphs we describe our results graphically.\nFigure 2 shows the plot of circulating current density\n(Ic ) versus kL for the two separate cases of spin-flip scattering and no-spin-flip scattering. When the impurity\nspin is \"up\" the interaction does not allow spin-flip for a\nspin-up incident electron due to conservation laws mentioned above. For this case problem reduces to that of\nsimple impurity studied earlier as mentioned above. On\nthe other hand when the impurity spin is \"down\" a spinflip scattering takes place. We compare the circulating\ncurrent densities for these two cases in order to see the\nrole of entanglement induced by the spin-flipper. Given\nthe fact that the entanglement reduces AB-oscillations\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, k is the wave-vector of incident electron. The subscripts u and d represent \"up\" and \"down\" spin states\nof the electron with the corresponding spinors \u03b1 and \u03b2\nrespectively (i.e., \u03c3z \u03b1 = 12 \u03b1, \u03c3z \u03b2 = \u2212 21 \u03b2) and \u03c7m denotes the wave function of the impurity17 with Sz = m\n(i.e., Sz \u03c7m = m\u03c7m ). The wavefunctions in equation\n(1) is a correlated function of the electron and impurity\nspins which takes into account the fact that the exchange\ninteraction conserves the z-component of the total spin\n~\n(~\u03c3 + S).\nThe incident electron is taken to be spin-up\npolarized. The reflected (transmitted) waves have amplitudes ru (tu ) and rd (td ) corresponding to the \"up\"\nand \"down\" spin components respectively. Continuity of\nthe wave functions and the current conservation6,16,17 at\nthe junctions J1 and J2 imply the following boundary\nconditions.\n\u03c81 (x = 0) = \u03c82 (x = 0) = \u03c83 (x = 0),\n\u03c81\u2032 (x = 0) = \u03c82\u2032 (x = 0) + \u03c83\u2032 (x = 0),\n~ 3 (x = l3 ),\n\u03c8 \u2032 (x = l3 ) \u2212 \u03c8 \u2032 (x = l3 ) = G(~\u03c3 * S)\u03c8\n4\n\n(2)\n\n3\n\n\u03c83 (x = l3 ) = \u03c84 (x = l3 ),\n\u03c84 (x = l3 + l4 ) = \u03c85 (x = 0) = \u03c82 (x = l2 ),\n2\n\n\freversals and current magnification in additional Fermi\nenergy ranges. We believe that non-suppression of this\nquantum effect is peculiar to elastic scattering in presence\nof exchange interaction leading to entanglement between\nthe different degrees of freedom of the electron (space\nand spin) and the impurity spin state. This model can\nalso be extended to study the phenomenon of quantum\nerasure with appropriate modifications. Only the presence of inelastic scattering, leading to irreversible loss of\nphase memory, can dephase AB oscillations and reduce\ncurrent magnification simultaneously.\n\nwe study whether it also reduces the current magnification. The solid curve is for the no-flip case while the\ndashed one is for the spin-flip case with all other parameters kept identical. The impurity strength (G) for both\nthe cases is 4.0. In both the cases we take l2 /L = 0.6\nand l3 /L = l4 /L = 0.2. The figure shows that , the\ncirculating current for spin-flip case is significantly less\nthan that of the no-flip case in the range 12 < kL < 16.\nThus one is led to believe that the flipper acting as a\ndephasor suppresses the quantum phenomena of current\nmagnification.\nHowever, this naive expectation turns out to be incorrect. This is substantiated in Fig. 3 which shows circulating current densities for the spin-flip and no-flip cases\nin the range 16 < kL < 19 for the same lengths as mentioned above. From this figure we see that in this range\nof Fermi energies the amplitude of the circulating current\nis actually enhanced in spite of the spin-flip scattering.\nThus the flipper can not only suppress the current magnification effect but can also enhance it in some other\nrange of Fermi energies. This effect can be ascribed to\nmultiple reflections induced by the flipper and the junctions. The fact that entanglement due to exchange interaction between the electron and the flipper does not\neliminate multiple reflections due to scattering at the impurity (and at the junctions) seems to be the reason behind the aforesaid features8 . Thus far we have discussed\nhow the flipper affects well known features of the impurity current magnification effect. However, the flipper induces some new features which we discuss below.\nThe plot of circulating current density (Ic ) versus kL\nfor l3 /L = l4 /L = 0.25 and l2 /L = 0.5 in the range\n5.6 < kL < 6.6 shows an additional peak in the circulating current density arising at a point corresponding to a\nminimum of spin-up transmission (which is same as the\nmaximum of the spin-down transmission). This is indicative of the spin-flip process. This effect is unique for the\nflipper having no counterpart in case of a simple impurity, i.e., in this region (5.6 < kL < 6.2) no-flip scattering\ncase does not show any circulating current. This can be\nascribed to the additional phase shifts caused by spin-flip\nscattering along-with multiple reflections. In the range\n6.2 < kL < 6.6 spin-flip scattering suppresses the current\nmagnification.\nFurther, we see yet another interesting feature, namely\nthe phenomenon of current reversal. This is depicted\nin Fig.5. In this figure we plot the circulating current\ndensity (Ic ) versus kL for l3 /L = l4 /L = 0.3125 and\nl2 /L = 0.375 in the wave vector range 10 < kL < 15\nin which we see that the spin-flip circulating current reverses its direction as compared to the no-flip case, i.e.,\nan anti-clockwise circulating current for the no-flip case\nis converted into a clockwise one in the spin-flip case.\nIn conclusion we have shown that presence of the spinflipper which suppresses the AB oscillations, need not\nsuppress the amplitude of current magnification. In fact,\nin certain range of Fermi energies the flipper enhances the\ncurrent magnification. Apart from this it leads to current\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nOne of us (DS) would like to thank Professor S.
