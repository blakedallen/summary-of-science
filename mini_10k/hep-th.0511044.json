Introduction\nUnderstanding the gauge/string correspondence in the context of realistic, non-supersymmetric, confining gauge theories remains a major open problem. No fully satisfactory\ngeometries dual to confining gauge theories are known so far, and there are general arguments that, in order to fully describe QCD, one will have to go beyond simple supergravity\nconsiderations. Nevertheless, it is quite remarkable that many qualitative properties of\nconfining theories do get reproduced correctly from computations in dual supergravity\ntheories. So far, a large body of work in this field has been concerned with a comparison of\nhadron spectra with the spectra of states on the gravity side. This is a rather kinematical\ntest, and one wonders whether more dynamical properties, such as decay rates, may perhaps also be captured by the correspondence. In recent work by Sakai and Sugimoto [1]\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\flarge mass\nflavour brane\n\nPSfrag replacements intermediate mass\nflavour brane\n\ninfrared \"wall\"\nFigure 1: A high-spin meson composed of heavy quarks, represented in the dual string\npicture as an open string ending on a flavour brane far away from the infrared \"wall\". To\ngood approximation, the string consists of two vertical segments, called \"region I\" and\none horizontal segment, called \"region II\".\n\ndecays of low-spin particles (which are captured by the supergravity and DBI modes) have\nbeen considered. The decays of high-spin mesons, which correspond to genuine stringy\nprocesses, have, however, not been addressed so far. In the present paper, we initiate the\nstudy of high-spin meson decays using the dual string theory description.\nIn the context of gauge/string duality, mesons are incorporated by adding one or more\nflavour branes into confining dual geometries [2]. In this setup, mesons of low-spin are\nidentified with small fluctuations of the flavour brane. This has allowed for a computation\nof masses and decay rates, both in the approximation in which the flavour brane is treated\nas a probe [1, 3] and in the case where the backreaction is taken into account [4]. However,\nthe supergravity (i.e. DBI) approximation is not sufficient to deal with mesons with spin\nlarger than one, which from a phenomenological point of view are at least as important.\nThese mesons are described by genuine string excitations, and their precise treatment would\nrequire the quantisation of strings in the confining geometries. Given the complexity of\nthe candidate dual geometries, this is a rather formidable task. However, very high-spin\nmesons can be described in this set up using semi-classical macroscopic spinning string\nconfigurations.\nThe open string configuration which we will consider is depicted in figure 1. This is\na U-shaped string, with its endpoints located on the flavour branes, and which is pulled\ntowards the infrared \"wall\" by the gravitational potential. It also extends along the \"wall\",\nwhere it is prevented from collapse by its rigid rotation. This string is equivalent to a system\ntwo quarks connected by a flux tube, with masses proportional to the distance from the\nflavour branes to the \"wall\". Thus one can have high-spin mesons with light, medium or\nheavy quarks. The spectrum exhibits deviation from Regge behaviour with appropriate\nnon-linear corrections which depend on the quark masses [5, 6].\nIn the present paper we study decays of high-spin mesons in detail, both from a qualitative as well as from a quantitative point of view. Semi-classically, the U-shaped string\ncan decay due to an instability of its endpoints or due to breaking of the string itself. The\nfirst type of decay channel is associated to radiation processes on the flavour brane, and\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fflavour brane\n\nPSfrag replacements\ninfrared \"wall\"\n\nFigure 2: The basic idea behind the description of high-spin mesons in duals of confining\ngauge theories (left). The open string corresponding to the meson starts on a flavour\nbrane, stretches to the infrared \"wall\", and then reaches up again to the (same or another)\nflavour brane. A decay process (right) requires that the string fluctuates, touches the\nflavour brane and then reconnects to it.\n\nwill be discussed a separate publication. To describe the second family of decay channels,\nrecall that an open string always has to end on a brane, and that therefore the string can\nbreak semi-classically if and only if one (or more) of its middle points touch one of the\nflavour branes. If no flavour brane is present on the infrared \"wall\", then classically this\ncondition is never satisfied for the U-shaped string of figure 1, except at those points where\nthe vertical part of the string intersects a flavour brane (splitting at these points, i.e. of the\nvertical segments of the string, was analysed in [7] and turns out to be highly suppressed).\nHowever, semi-classically, there is a finite probability that the string, due to the quantum\nfluctuations, touches one of the flavour branes, splits and gets reconnected to it, producing\ntwo or more outgoing mesons (i.e. \"hanging\" open strings, see figure 2).\nTherefore, in order to compute the decay rate semi-classically, we need to compute the\nprobability of the horizontal part of the string to touch a flavour brane and the probability\nthat the string splits when it is on the brane.1 Although the calculation of the string fluctuation probability is a hard task, we have found several simplification and approximation\nmethods which make it feasible. The main idea is to focus on the part of the geometry\nnear the \"wall\", and then construct the string wave function in this simplified geometry by\nsemi-classical quantisation (for details see section 4). Once this is achieved, the probability\nfor finding the string at a certain distance from the \"wall\" can be extracted. On the other\nhand, for a string which is located on the brane, the probability for it to split at any given\npoint can be computed using the flat space results of Dai and Polchinski [8] and Mitchell\nand Turok [9]. We expect that these semi-classical computations should capture the main\nfeatures of the full string decay process. That this is indeed the case can be shown explicitly\nin flat space, by comparing this splitting rate with a full quantum computation.\nIn gauge theory (i.e. QCD), meson decay widths are not easily computable from first\nprinciples because of strong coupling problems. A heuristic model has therefore been\ndeveloped some thirty years ago, which goes under the name of the \"Lund\" model, and\n1\n\nFluctuations of the vertical parts of the strings are also possible, and would lead to decay channels\nin which the initial meson decays into a meson (i.e. a hanging open string) and a glue ball (i.e. a closed\nstring). These channels are more suppressed due to the centrifugal force which suppresses the transverse\nfluctuations, and additional powers of gs which suppress open-to-closed string amplitudes with respect to\nopen-to-open string amplitudes. We will therefore not discuss these processes.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fvery successfully describes decays of various mesons. In this model a meson is described\nby two massive particles (quarks) connected by a massless relativistic string which models\nthe strong force between the quarks. The probability that a string splitting event occurs\nis determined by the Schwinger pair production probability. This model is in widespread\nuse in event generators such as Pythia [10], and has turned out to be surprisingly effective.\nWe will see that the main qualitative features of the Lund model are, indeed, reproduced\nfrom the holographic stringy dual computation (for a comparison between our model and\nthe Lund model, see section 5). Moreover, properties such as the Zweig rule, which have to\nbe \"added by hand\" to the Lund model, are an automatic consequence of the holographic\ndescription. Our model also predicts some deviations from the Lund model for very large\nvalues of the spin, but there is unfortunately not yet enough experimental data in this\nregime to see whether those corrections are indeed required.\nIn order to make this paper self-contained, we first review in section 2 in some detail\nthe dual picture of mesons, as it arises in the string/gauge theory correspondence (readers\nfamiliar with this material can safely skip to the next section). In section 3 we then give\na qualitative description of the decay process of mesons, both in the old phenomenological\nmodels as well as in the new setup. Our main quantitative result is presented in section 4,\nwhere we show that the decay rates computed in the new picture indeed agree with the\nrates obtained in the Lund model. The reader who is not interested in any technical details,\nbut rather in our setup and in comparison with experiment, is advised to go directly to\nsection 5, which can be read independently.\n\n2. A review of the dual picture of mesons\n2.1 Supergravity duals of confining gauge theories\nTo construct the holographic picture of mesons one first has to specify a supergravity\nmodel which is dual to the desired confining gauge theory. By now, there are several\nsupergravity backgrounds which are know to be associated to confining gauge dynamics.\nAn important model based on near-extremal D4-branes [11] was shown to exhibit, in the\nlimit of large temperature, features of the low energy regime of strongly coupled pure YangMills theory [12]. In particular, the Wilson loop of these models was shown to exhibit an\narea law behaviour, as required by a confining theory [13]. Recently, an analogous noncritical supergravity model was proposed, which is dual to the same gauge system, but\nwithout a contaminating Kaluza-Klein sector [14].\nIn this work we study a mechanism for meson decays which does not rely heavily on\nthe details of the confining background, but rather uses generic features which all known\nconfining geometries possess. However, some explicit parts of the computations will be\nperformed for a prototype class of models based on near-extremal D4-branes. Therefore,\nlet us first briefly review the main features of this model. The basic setup is that of type-IIA\nsuperstring theory with a set of Nc D4-branes that wrap a circle [12]. Fermions are taken to\nhave anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circle. The corresponding near-horizon\nlimit of the background consists of a metric, a running dilaton, and a four-form RR field\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fstrength given by\n\u0012 \u00133/2 \u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0003\nU 3/2 \u0002\nR\ndU 2\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n2\nds =\n+ U d\u03a94\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dX dX + f (U )d\u03b8 +\nR\nU\nf (U )\n\u0012 \u00133/4\n\u0012 \u00133\nU\nU\u039b\n2\u03c0Nc\n\u03c6\ne = gs\n\u01eb4 ,\nf (U ) = 1 \u2212\n,\nF4 =\n.\nR\nV4\nU\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere U is the radial direction, which has dimension of length and is bounded from below\nby U \u2265 U\u039b . We will refer to U = U\u039b as the \"wall\" of space-time. Note, however, that this\nis only a wall in coordinate space, in the same sense in which r = 0 in polar coordinates\nis a \"wall\" of the plane. The geometry near U = U\u039b is actually cigar-like. Extending\nbeyond U = U\u039b , one ends up on the other side (i.e. at an antipodal point) of the cigar.2\nThe worldvolume coordinates of the D4-branes are along the X \u03bc (\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3) directions and \u03b8 is the thermal circle. The line element of the unit four-sphere is denoted by d\u03a94 ,\nits volume by V4 = 38 \u03c0 2 , its volume-form by \u01eb4 and its radius R is given by R3 = \u03c0gs Nc ls3\nwhere ls is the string length.

At every fixed radial slice, the space has four-dimensional Lorentz invariance (corresponding to the directions parallel to the \"wall\") times the internal direction\n2\n\nFor future reference, let us also recall that the four-dimensional Yang-Mills gauge coupling is related\nto the other parameters by\n2\ngYM\nN = 2 M\u039b R3 /\u03b1\u2032 ;\n(2.2)\ndetails of the derivation of this formula and the other expressions in this section can be found in [6].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f(corresponding the required global symmetries of the theory, but giving rise to unwanted\nKaluza-Klein excitations). And the warping of the space in the transverse direction is such\nthat the Wilson loop in this geometry shows area law behaviour.\n2.2 Flavour branes in confining backgrounds\nTo describe the holographic picture of mesons requires the introduction of additional flavour\nbranes to the system of branes which give rise to confining geometries. If the number of\nflavour branes is small enough, these can be treated as probes, whose dynamics is governed\nby the DBI action. The open strings between the original Nc branes and the flavour branes\nplay the role of quarks (anti-quarks) in the fundamental (anti-fundamental) representation\nof the colour and flavour groups. This way of incorporating fundamental quarks was\noriginally proposed by Karch and Katz [2] in the context of the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 model. The first\napplication of these ideas to a confining model was made in [15] with D7-branes probing the\nKlebanov-Strassler geometry. Bending of the probe brane due to the gravitational potential\nis an important effect, as it was shown to be associated to U (1)A symmetry breaking in\nthe work of [16]. Flavour D6-branes were introduced into the model given by (2.1) in [17].3\nIn order to exhibit flavour chiral symmetry breaking, one has to consider models which\nexhibit UL (Nf ) \u00d7 UR (Nf ) chiral symmetry. The recent model of Sakai and Sugimoto [1, 3]\nincorporates this phenomenon by introducing D8/D8-branes as flavour probe branes. An\nanalogous non-critical model based on D4/D4-branes was analysed in [33]. For the purpose\nof our calculations, the distinction between all these models is, however, irrelevant. Because\nthe spinning string configurations are readily available for the model with D6-branes [17],\nwe will restrict to this case in our explicit computations.\nIn order to describe flavour probe D6-branes in the geometry (2.1), it is more convenient\nto introduce different coordinates in the metric in the directions transverse to the \"wall\".\nA metric adapted to the embedding of the D6-brane is [17]\ni\ni\nh\nh\nds\u03032 = K(\u03c1) d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03a924 = K(\u03c1) d\u03bb2 + \u03bb2 d\u03a92 + dr 2 + r 2 d\u03c62 ,\n3/2\n\nU (\u03c1)\n\n\u2261\u03c1\n\n3/2\n\nU\u039b2\n,\n+ 3/2\n4\u03c1\n\n(2.7)\n\nK(\u03c1) = R\n\n3/2\n\nU\n\n1/2 \u22122\n\n\u03c1\n\n,\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c1 =\u03bb +r .\n\nThe probe D6-brane extends in the \"wall\" directions, fills out the S 2 sphere spanned by d\u03a92\nand has nontrivial profile in the r, \u03bb plane. The equation for the brane profile r(\u03bb) follows\nfrom the DBI action, and can be solved approximately in various regions. The shape\nof the D6-brane in these direction is depicted in figure 3: it stretches in the r direction\nfrom r = \u03c1f at \u03bb = 0 to r = r\u221e at \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. Due to the non-trivial profile of the D6-brane,\nthe U (1)A symmetry (corresponding to rotations in the r, \u03c6 plane, i.e. in the \u03c6 direction)\nis spontaneously broken and the quark condensate hq\u0304qi is non-zero. Asymptotically one\nhas r = r\u221e + \u03bbc where r\u221e is related to the QCD (current algebra) quark mass and c is\n3\n\nFlavour branes have since been introduced in many other confining and non-confining models (see\ne.g. [4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]). Other related holographic models for hadrons have also\nbeen built [29, 30, 31, 32], achieving notable success for their quantitative predictions.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fr\n\u03c1f\n\nPSfrag replacements\nD6\n\nr\u221e\n\n\u03c1\u039b\nD4\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 3: Schematic overview of the embedding of the probe D6-brane, described by r(\u03bb),\ninto the geometry of the stack of D4-branes (negative values of \u03bb correspond to points\nwith \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u03c0 while negative values of r correspond to \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c0). The dotted halfcircles are equal-potential lines of the gravitational field, the solid half-circle is the IR\n\"wall\". Also depicted is a high-spin meson, represented by the thick vertical line. This is\na side-on view of an open string stretching from the flavour D6-brane to the \"wall\", along\nthe \"wall\", and then back up to the flavour D6-brane.\n\nrelated to the quark condensate. The U (1)A symmetry is thus restored asymptotically\nwhen the quark mass is set to zero, but spontaneously broken due to the bending of the\nbrane. Equipped with this information we now proceed to describe the mesons of these\nmodels.\n2.3 High-spin mesons\nThe spectrum of the (pseudo) scalar and vector mesons can be extracted in the dual\nsupergravity backgrounds from the spectrum of the fluctuation of the flavour branes. Just\nas for glueballs, these can only account for the meson states with spin smaller than or\nequal to one. The other mesons should be captured by genuine string excitations, which\nare generically very hard to analyse. However, when the spin of the string becomes very\nlarge, further simplifications occur, and classical solutions of the string sigma model can\nbe used.\nA particularly interesting large, open string configuration, was recently constructed\nby Kruczenski et al. [6] and Paredes and Talavera [34]. This is an open, U-shaped string\nas depicted in figure 1 and 3. It hangs from the probe D6-brane and is pulled by the\ngravitational force towards the \"wall\" of the background. At the same time, the string\nrotates in the plane parallel to the \"wall\", and is extended in this direction due to the\ncentrifugal force. More precisely, the region spanned by the open string can be divided\ninto two parts:\n\u2022 Region I, a \"vertical\" section characterised by\n\u2022 Region II, a \"horizontal\" section\n\nd\u03c1\n\u2192 \u221e,\ndR\n\nd\u03c1\n\u2192 0,\ndR\n\nwhere R2 = (X 1 )2 + (X 2 )2 and X 1 , X 2 is the plane of rotation of the string. In the limit of\nlarge angular momentum and hence large separation, the string is indeed well-approximated\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fby two vertical segments and one horizontal one, and explicit simple solutions can be found\nseparately in these two regions.\nIt was further realised in [6] that this classical string configuration can be viewed\nas a rigid open string with two massive endpoints, where the masses of the particles are\nproportional to the vertical parts of string. The equivalence comes about as follows. To\n\"sew\" the solutions in regions I and II one has to impose the condition that the string\nendpoints move with the same velocity as the vertical parts of the string,\nZ \u03c1f\nmq\n1\nU (\u03c1)\n1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2 = \u03c9 2 L\nd\u03c1\n= \u03c92L\n,\n(2.8)\n\u03c1\nTeff\n(U\u039b /R)3/2 \u03c1\u039b\nwhere on the right-hand side of the equation we have used the expression for the mass of\nthe dynamical quarks [35],\nZ \u03c1\u039b\nZ \u03c1\u039b\n1\nU\n1\n\u221a\ng\ng\n=\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1 .\n(2.9)\nmq =\n00 \u03c1\u03c1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1 \u03c1f\n2\u03c0\u03b1 \u03c1f\n\u03c1\nThere are several arguments in favour of identifying the mass of the vertical part of the\nstring with the constituent mass of the quark, and not a current algebra mass.\nThe relation (2.8) is precisely the relation that one derives for a string with two massive\nendpoints of mass mq . Indeed by evaluating the energy and angular momentum of the string\nin the two regions one finds that\nEI = \u221a\n\n2mq\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2\n\nEII = Teff\n\n2\narcsin(\u03c9L) ,\n\u03c9\n\n2mq \u03c9L2\n,\nJI = \u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2\n\u0011\np\n1 \u0010\nJII = Teff 2 arcsin(\u03c9L) \u2212 \u03c9L 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2 .\n\u03c9\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe expressions in region I are those for two spinning relativistic particles. In region II\nwe find the energy and angular momentum of an open string in flat spacetime, with an\neffective string tension Teff , given by\n\u0012 \u00133/2\nq\n1\n1\nU\u039b\n2\ng00 gxx wall =\nTeff =\n=\nM 2 (g2 N ) .\n(2.11)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1\n2\u03c0\u03b1\nR\n27 \u03c0 \u039b YM\nCombining the results from the two regions we get\nr\nr\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nTeff\nmq\nmq\nTeff\n2\narcsin x +\n, J = 2 arcsin x + x\n,\nE=2\n\u03c9\nTL\n\u03c9\nTL\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere x \u2261 \u03c9L. For fixed mq and Teff , there is only one free parameter, for example L,\nwhich uniquely fixes all other parameters: the energy E, the angular momentum J and\nthe angular velocity \u03c9.\nThere are two important limits of this solution which will be relevant for us later. The\nfirst limit is the one in which the dynamical quarks are very light. This limit is relativistic,\nas the velocity x of the endpoints tends to the velocity of light. The energy and angular\nmomentum reduce to\n1\n\u03c0\nE2 ,\n(2.13)\nx\u21921:\nE \u2192 \u03c0Teff L ,\nJ \u2192 Teff L2 \u21d2 J \u2192\n2\n2\u03c0Teff\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fi.e. we recover the standard Regge trajectory in flat space with the effective tension (2.11),\nas expected. We thus see that the mass of the U-shaped high-spin mesons is of the order\nq\n(2.14)\nMhigh \u223c M\u039b gY2 M N\n\nwhile recall that masses of the low spin (supergravity) mesons were Mlow \u223c M\u039b \u223c MKK .\nWe thus see that in the supergravity regime, where gY2 M N \u226b 1, there is a gap between\nthe low and high-spin mesons which hints at the fact that the holographic dual of hadron\n2 N \u223c 1.\nphysics will require gYM\nThe second limit is the limit of heavy quarks, i.e. the non-relativistic limit\nx\u21920:\n\nmq \u2248\n\nTeff L\n\u2192\u221e\nx2\n\n\u21d2\n\nmq \u226b Teff L .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThis in turn implies\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nE = 2Teff L 1 + 2 + O(x3 )\nx\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nJ = 2Teff L\n+ O(x)\nx\n\n\u2192 2 mq + Teff L ,\n\n(2.16)\n\np\n\u2192 2 Teff mq L3/2 .\n\nWe see that in this limit, the energy and angular momentum blow up as one would expect:\nit takes an infinite amount of energy to spin very heavy particles. Note that in both these\nlimits, whether the quark is light or heavy is measured with respect to the total mass of\nthe flat part of the string. This mass is given by Teff L, rather than by Ts L,\nmq = \u22122Teff L \u03b4x \u21d4 mq \u226a 2Teff L .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe relations (2.16) imply that for a fixed and finite energy, the length of the string has to\n\u221a\ngo to zero (in units of 1/ Teff ) as the mass of the quarks is increased .\nIt is also straightforward to generalise the expressions of the energy and angular momentum of the classical meson (2.12) to the case of a meson composed of quarks of two\ndifferent masses; details can be found in [36]. In general one can associate a different value\nof \u03c1f to each of the stacks of the probe brane, namely \u03c1fi to the ith stack. In presently\navailable holographic setups, there are no limitations on the locations \u03c1fi and the corresponding quark masses. For convenience we group them into three classes according to the\nvalue of distance from the \"wall\", which translates to three types of quark masses:\nml \u2248 Teff (\u03c1fl \u2212 \u03c1\u039b ) \u226a \u039bQCD ,\n\n(2.18a)\n\nmm \u2248 Teff (\u03c1fl \u2212 \u03c1\u039b ) \u223c \u039bQCD ,\n\n(2.18b)\n\nmh \u2248 Teff (\u03c1fl \u2212 \u03c1\u039b ) \u226b \u039bQCD .\n\n(2.18c)\n\nAccordingly, there are six classes of mesons according to the possible different probe branes\non which the stringy meson ends,\n(l, l) , (l, m) , (l, h) , (m, m) , (m, h) , (h, h) .\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(2.19)\n\n\f3. Old and new descriptions of meson decay\n3.1 The Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov model\nHaving reviewed the dual kinematical picture of glueballs and mesons, we now want to\nfocus on dynamical aspects. In the present section we will compare the qualitative aspects\nof the old, phenomenological picture of meson decay with the new picture as it arises from\nthe gauge/string correspondence. A quantitative discussion follows in section 4.\nIn [37] the decay of a meson, or rather the process of multiple quark pair production,\nwas described in terms of a model where a meson is built from a quark/anti-quark pair\nwith a colour electric flux tube between them.4 When a new pair is created at a certain\npoint along the flux tube, it will be pulled apart and tear the original tube into two tubes.\nThe model is based on two assumptions: (i) that at the hadronic energy scale of 1 GeV\nthe quarks can be treated as Dirac particles with constituent masses; (ii) that there is a\nchromo-electric flux tube of universal thickness which is being created in a timescale that is\nshort compared to the hadronic timescale. The chromoelectric field is treated as a classical\nlongitudinal abelian field.5 The flux tube is parametrised by the radius of the tube rt , the\ngauge coupling g which is also the charge of the quark and the electric field Et . The energy\nper unit length stored in the tube is equal to the string tension,\n1\n1\n1\nTeff = Et2 \u03c0 rt2 =\n= g Et\n\u2032\n2\n2\u03c0\u03b1\n4\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere in the last part of the equation the Gauss law was used. It is easy to verify that\ng2 = 4rt2 /\u03b1\u2032 . When the radius of the flux tube is smaller than the size of the tube but\nlarger than the distance scale relevant to pair production, i.e. when it is of the order of\nrt \u223c 2.5 GeV\u22121 , the coupling constant is indeed weak, g2 /8\u03c0 < 1.\nThe process of pair creation inside the tube is mapped to a system of Dirac particles\nof mass mq interacting with a constant electric field, which was solved by Schwinger. From\nthe probability of a single pair-creation event to occur,\n!\n\u03c0m2q\n,\n(3.2)\nPpair prod. = exp \u2212\n2 Teff\none derives [37] the decay probability per unit time and per unit volume,\n!\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\n2 X\n2\u03c0m2q n\n\u03c0m2q n\nTeff\ng2 E 2 X 1\n1\nP =\n= 3\n.\nexp \u2212\nexp \u2212\n16\u03c0 3 n=1 n2\ngE\n\u03c0 n=1 n2\n2Teff\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis probability was then used to determine the probability of a meson to decay, which\nwas found to be 1 \u2212 e\u2212V4 (tM )P where tM is the meson lifetime measured in its rest frame.\nThe volume of the system was computed for a rotating flux tube and for a one dimensional\n4\n\nThis model was also suggested independently at around the same time by Gurvich [38], who obtained\nsimilar qualitative results as Casher et al. [37].\n5\nA more precise calculation, which does not rely on the WKB approximation and probes the full nonabelian structure of the flux tube, was recently presented by Nayak [39].\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\foscillator. For the first case we use M = \u03c0Teff L which implies that V4 (tM ) = \u03c0rt2 LtM and\nhence the decay width is \u0393 = \u03c0rt2 LP and finally\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0393\n2r 2\n(3.4)\n= t P = (0.6 \u2212 8.5) \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nM rot Teff\nThe numerical value was derived by using (3.3) for the decay probability, introducing\nconstituent masses for mu , md and ms (taken to be 75 MeV for the light quarks and\n400 MeV for the heavy ones, with Teff \u2248 0.177 GeV2 ) and summing it over the three\nflavours.\nFor the case of the oscillator, the relation between the length and the mass is given\nby M = Teff L and therefore on average V4 (tM ) = 21 \u03c0rt2 LtM and hence \u0393 = 12 \u03c0rt2 LP which\nmeans that\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0393\n\u03c0 \u0393\n=\n.\n(3.5)\nM osc\n4 M rot\nFrom expression (3.3) two properties are immediately clear: the exponential suppression\ndoes not depend on the length of the string, while the total probability scales linearly in\nthe length.\nLet us finally also mention that the Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov model is not the only\nmodel for meson decay. An alternative approach to string breaking, which does not involve\nthe Schwinger pair production process but rather the quantum fluctuations of the flux\ntube, was developed by Kokoski and Isgur [40]. Since their model is rather different in\nspirit we will not discuss it here.\n3.2 Corrections due to masses and angular momentum\nThe model described above is one of the main ingredients of the so-called Lund fragmentation model [41, 42, 43], used for prediction of meson shower and hadronisation events in\naccelerators. Two simple improvements have been suggested in the literature. The first\none consists of taking into account the presence of massive particles at the string endpoints.\nIn this case the linear relation M = Teff L between the length and the mass of the meson\nis modified. In the approximation of small quark masses one finds [44]\n\u0012 2\u0013\nL\nmi\n2\nm1 + m2\n=\n\u2212\n+O\n.\n(3.6)\nM\n\u03c0 Teff\n2Teff M\nM2\n\nThis relation has been derived by many authors, see e.g. [36, 45]. Gupta and Rosenzweig [45] applied this relation to decay rates, and concluded that for a decay width \u0393\nwhich is linear in the length, \u0393/M is no longer a constant. It was shown in [45] that the\nratio increases with the increase of M until it reaches its universal value for large M , i.e. for\na small ratio mq /M .\nFurthermore, the model of Gupta and Rosenzweig [45] incorporates the centrifugal\nbarrier that the quark has to pass in the tunnelling process of the pair creation. The WKB\napproximation, which for the case of a single pair creation with no centrifugal barrier\nreproduces exactly the exponential factor of (3.3), now reads\n!\nZ rc r\nl(l\n+\n1)\n,\n(3.7)\ndr (E \u2212 V (r))2 \u2212 m2q \u2212\nP \u223c exp \u22122\nr2\n0\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhere mq is the mass of the quark created, rc is the turning point and l is the angular\nmomentum of the tunnelling quark. If the quark tunnels from the point at a distance Rq\nfrom the centre of mass to a point at a distance Rq + r, then the quark acquires the angular\nmomentum of the vaporised segment of the string which can easily be calculated in the\nlimit of small r. When this expression is inserted into (3.7) one finds that the probability\nfor a split of the string takes the form\n\uf8ee\n\u0010\n\u00112 \uf8f9\nw\n2\n1\n+\n6m(1\u2212w 2 R2q )\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u03c0mq\n(3.8)\nP \u223c exp \uf8f0\u2212\n\u00113/2 \uf8fb ,\n\u0010\n2Teff\nw 3 Rq\n1 \u2212 2Teff (1\u2212w2 R2 )2\nq\n\nwhich means that there is an extra suppression factor which is position dependent. This\nyields a preference of the string to decay in a symmetric fashion, i.e. in the middle. The\nmain net effect of the centrifugal potential is to increase the stability of the meson. In [45] a\ncomparison with experimental data was made, indicating that corrections due the massive\nstring end points lead to better agreement than with the massless approximation of the\nbasic model [37]. Due to the lack of high-precision data for decay widths, the detailed\nstructure of the exponent could, however, not be tested.\n3.3 Decay of mesons in the new picture\n\nHaving summarised the Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov model for meson decay, as well as\nthe various improvements of it, the question is now whether we can reproduce those phenomenological formulae from the holographically dual description. We have recalled the\ndescription of high-spin mesons in section 2.3. These are U-shaped strings, with two vertical sections that connect to the two endpoints which are on one or two flavour branes, and a\nhorizontal part that stretches along the infrared \"wall\". Kinematically, this closely mimics\nthe mesons of the Lund model because, a was shown by Kruczenski et al. [6], the vertical\nparts of the U-shaped string behave as two massive particles attached to the endpoints of\nthe string. Classically, this system is stable.\nQuantum mechanically, the meson configuration is unstable. One distinguishes decay\nmodes due to fluctuations of the string endpoints and those associated with the splitting\nof the string. The former translates into the production of low-spin mesons, which will be\ndiscussed in a forthcoming publication. The process of splitting implies the presence of two\nhigh-spin mesons in the outgoing state. In the present paper we will focus exclusively on\nthe last channel, leaving the other channel for future work. Before we go into the details of\nthe computation, we will first describe this decay channel qualitatively and highlight some\nuniversal features which are independent of the actual calculation.\nIn the general setup described in section 2.2, the system is built from three types of\nflavour branes characterised by their distance from the \"wall\", namely, light medium and\nheavy (l, m, h) flavour branes, and correspondingly by six types of mesons. For a meson\nto decay into two mesons it has to split, in such a way that the new endpoints also lie on\na flavour brane. The decay probability thus naturally consists of two separate factors: the\nprobability of the string to split at a given point, multiplied with the probability that this\ngiven point is actually located at a flavour brane.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\nfluctuate + split\n\nfluctuate + split\n\nonly split\n\nFigure 4: The decay channels for a meson composed of one heavy and one intermediatemass quark. When the newly produced quarks are massive, the computation of the decay\nwidth involves the computation of the probability that the string undergoes quantum\nfluctuations and touches a flavour brane. This is expected to lead to exponentially suppression (two figures on the left). Only when the new quarks are massless is the decay\nwidth given simply by the open string decay decay width.\n\nThe probability of an open string to split has been studied a long time ago for strings\nwith Neumann boundary conditions in flat space-time [8, 9, 46]. Assuming that these\nresults are qualitatively correct also in a curved background6 , the first factor of the decay\nwidth is therefore under control. The results of [8, 9, 46] show that the open string decay\nprobability per unit length is constant, or equivalently, that the decay width is linear in\nthe length of the string. This linear scaling with the length is also present in the CasherNeuberger-Nussinov model.\nThe second factor is more complicated. If the string splits on the infrared \"wall\", it\ncorresponds to the creation of two massless quarks at the new endpoints. This is clearly a\nvery special situation. In the general case, the string will first have to undergo quantummechanical fluctuations, such that one or more points touch one of the flavour branes\nassociated to massive quarks. Schematically, any meson can split into three kinds of mesons\n(a, b) \u2192 (a, c) + (c, b)\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere the a, b, c stands for l, m and h. In figure 4 we demonstrate the decay pattern of a\nmeson composed of one heavy and one intermediate-mass quark. Our goal will be to show\nthat this fluctuation probability is responsible for a Gaussian suppression as a function of\nthe mass of the newly created quarks, just like in (3.3) of the Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov\nmodel.\nTechnically, it is quite complicated to compute the fluctuation probabilities, as it involves the quantum dynamics of the U-shaped string in a curved background subject to\nnon-trivial boundary conditions. We will address this computation in detail in the next\n6\n\nThis assumption has been used also in the context of strings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [47, 48].\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fPSfrag replacementsq\n\nq\nq\u0304\n\nq\u0304\n\nq\n\nq\u0304\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u0304 \u2032\n\nFigure 5: The Zweig rule illustrated. The dominant decay channel for mesons is the\nprocess on the left, in which the original quarks are part of the mesons in the outgoing\nstate. The process on the right, in which the quark and anti-quark which constitute the\ninitial meson annihilate, is suppressed.\n\nsection. However, several general features of meson decays can easily be seen to be automatically satisfied, without further computations:\n\n\u2022 Due to the fact that a split involves only one flavour brane, it is completely trivial in\nthis geometrical picture that the decay obeys the conservation of flavour symmetry.\nDue to the split, a new vertical line coming into a certain flavour brane is necessarily\nfollowed by an outgoing vertical line. If the former is assigned to be a charge + then\nthe latter has obviously a \u2212 charge and hence charge is conserved. If there is a set\nof Nf flavour branes, then the endpoints of the created pair of vertical strings are\nin the complex conjugate representation of each other, and thus also the non-abelian\nflavour symmetry is conserved.\n\n\u2022 It is also clear that the pattern of decays depicted in figure 4 do not include processes\nthat are suppressed by the so-called Zweig rule. These suppressed decays, described\nin figure 5, involve the annihilation of the original pair of quark anti-quark. In our\npicture this involves fluctuations that bring together the two endpoints. This is\nobviously of higher order in gs and hence further suppressed in the large-N limit.\n\nThe decay of a meson is quite different from the decay of glueballs. The reason is that\nan open string corresponding to a meson can spontaneously split if and only if the splitting\npoint lies on a flavour probe D6-brane. Thus, for the U-shaped string as in figure 2, no\ndecays are possible which are as simple as the decay process of closed strings. Instead, one\nhas to take into account the probability that the U-shaped string fluctuates and touches the\nflavour brane. This is a true quantum-mechanical effect and requires information beyond\nthe probability of splitting a string. In the next section, we will show that this effect can,\nhowever, be computed in several approximations. We will thereby obtain a prediction for\nthe decay rate of mesons.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f4. Meson decay widths\n4.1 General remarks on wave functions, probabilities and widths\nIn the previous sections we have reviewed the kinematical description of mesons and glueballs in confining backgrounds, as well as the old and the new ways to describe decay\nprocesses. We will now turn to a quantitative analysis of the decay rates of mesons as\ncomputed using the the gauge/string correspondence. We will see that this new way of\ndescribing meson decay agrees also at the quantitative level with the results of the old\nCasher-Neuberger-Nussinov model [37, 43, 45]. Before we go into the details of this computation, we should first make some general comments concerning the construction of the\nwave function and the method to extract the decay width.\nThe general idea behind the construction of the string wave function is the following.\nOne starts from the classical configuration of the rotating U-shaped string. One then\ndetermines the spectrum of fluctuations \u03b4X M (\u03c4, \u03c3) around this string configuration.7 In\norder to be able to quantise these fluctuations, they have to be written in decoupled form,\ni.e. in terms of normal coordinates. Generically, the normal coordinates {Nn (X M )} are\nnontrivial functions of all target space coordinates X M , due to the fact that the target\nspace metric is curved. Each mode Nn is described by its own wave function \u03a8n [Nn ], and\nthe total wave function is just a product of wave functions for the individual modes,\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003 Y \u0002\n(4.1)\n\u03a8 {Nn } =\n\u03a8n Nn (X M ) .\nn\n\nAnalysing the system through the normal modes Nn is in general not an easy task, because\nthe space is curved and the normal modes are thus hard to find.\nOnce the wave function is constructed, the first thing one would like to extract is the\nprobability that, due to quantum fluctuations, the string touches the brane at one or more\npoints. We will call this probability Pfluct and it is formally given by\nZ \u2032\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\n,\n(4.2)\n\u03a8 {Nn }\nPfluct =\n{Nn }\n\nwhere the prime indicates that the integral is taken only over those string configurations\n{Nn } which satisfy the condition\n\u0001\nmax U (\u03c3) \u2265 UB .\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis is a complicated condition to take into account, because U (\u03c3) is a linear combination\nof an infinite number of modes. While the constraint is simple in terms of U (\u03c3), it thus\nbecomes highly complicated in terms of the modes Nn . The probability (4.2) only measures\nhow likely it is that the string touches the brane, independent of the number of points that\ntouch the brane. Note that this is a dimensionless probability, not a dimensionful decay\nwidth.\n7\n\nFermionic fluctuations are irrelevant for our discussion and will be ignored throughout.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\n+\n\nR\n\nx\n\u0002\n\u0003\nK {Nn } dx \u2248 2L \u00d7 \u03ba\u22121\nmax\n\nFigure 6: The approximation used to separate the L-dependent factor in the decay width\nfrom the dimensionless remainder. The integral over all configurations which touch the\nstring at two points and have a maximum at U = UB is, after taking into account the\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndimensionful measure factor K {Nn } , approximately equal to L times the volume of this\nsubspace of configuration space.\n\nLet us now turn to the computation of the decay width itself. As we have explained\nin section 3.3, we will assume that the decay width of the mesonic string is approximately\nequal to the decay width of an open string in flat space-time multiplied with the probability\nthat the string actually touches the flavour brane. As we have already mentioned (see also\nappendix A.2), the decay width of an open string in flat space-time has been shown to be\nlinear in the length [8, 9, 46] (and, for dimensional reasons, therefore inversely proportional\nto the tension). We can thus define the \"decay width per unit length\" \u0393open /L, as well as\na related, dimensionless, L-independent quantity given by\nPsplit :=\n\n1 \u0393open\n.\nTeff L\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn terms of this \"splitting probability\", the decay width of our U-shaped string is now\ngiven by\nZ \u2032\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003 2 \u0002\nK {Nn } .\n(4.5)\n\u03a8 {Nn }\n\u0393 = Teff Psplit \u00d7\n{Nn }\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\nThe factor K {Nn } is a measure factor with the dimension of length. It measures, for a\ngiven string configuration, the size of the segment(s) of the string which intersect(s) the\nflavour brane. We will not be very explicit about this factor. A simple way to think about\nit is to consider e.g. the subspace of configurations with two intersection points for which\nthe maximum of U (\u03c3) is fixed (see figure 6). There is then one direction in configuration\nspace which effectively integrates over all positions at which the string intersects the brane.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThe K {Nn } measures the infinitesimal size of the intersection point(s) of the string with\nthe brane. Provided that the probabilities for the configurations in this integral are more\nor less equal (for which we will find evidence in section 4.3), we then obtain an overall\nfactor L in the decay width. The overall factor L of course also arises trivially for the zero\nmode fluctuation, where the string touches the brane at all points at the same time.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nWe will not be able to compute (4.5) as it stands, because the factor K {Nn } is too\ncomplicated to write down in general. We will instead assume that any configuration is\nalways part of a one-parameter family of related configurations, which intersect the brane\nat different points but otherwise have similar shape, as in figure 6. We will assume that\nthe probability for all these configurations is roughly the same, and that we can therefore\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\falways split off a factor L from the integral. Typically this will yield an upper bound on\nthe decay width, because the configurations with intersections in the middle typically have\nlarger probability. What remains is a dimensionless factor depending on the position of\nthe flavour brane. To be precise, we will compute the right-hand side of\nZ \u2032\nZ \u2032\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003 2 \u0002\n, (4.6)\n\u03a8 {Nn }\nK {Nn } < Teff Psplit L \u03bamax\n\u03a8 {Nn }\n\u0393 = Teff Psplit\n{Nn }\n\n{Nn }\n\nwhere Pfluct is given in (4.2) and \u03bamax is now dimensionless, arising from our approximation\n(in case all configurations would be as in figure 6, \u03bamax would equal 1/\u03c0). In the following,\nwe will therefore only be concerned with the computation of\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(4.7)\n\u0393approx = Teff Psplit \u00d7 L \u00d7 \u03bamax \u00d7 Pfluct .\n\nIn particular, we will not be concerned any more with the factor in brackets, but focus\nsolely on the dependence of the fluctuation probability Pfluct on the position UB of the\nflavour brane. This dependence on UB translates to a dependence of the decay width on\nthe mass of the produced quarks.\nDespite this simplification, the computation of the decay width is still complicated, as\nthe computation of Pfluct involves dealing with the curvature of the background and taking\ninto account the non-trivial constraint (4.3). In the following sections, we will describe\nvarious approximation methods which can be used to evaluate Pfluct and thereby the decay\nwidth \u0393. A justification of these simplifications will be obtained in section 4.3, where we\ncompare the continuum results with a numerical analysis using a string bit model.\n4.2 Explicit computation of the decay widths\nLet us first discuss the simplest type of approximation in which we approximate the spacetime near the \"wall\" with flat space-time. There are two different configurations which\nmay appear: the light and the heavy mesons (see section 2.3). Recall that in the case of a\nlight meson, i.e. when the flavour brane associated to the initial quarks is located on the\n\"wall\", the string endpoints satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the case of a heavy\nmeson, the long vertical parts of the string suppress, by their \"weight\", the fluctuations of\nthe part of the string near the end of the horizontal part. Therefore, when viewed from\nthe \"wall\", the string again looks like an open string with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nHence, in both cases, one can think about these strings, in first approximation, as being\nattached to the \"brane\" which is located at the \"wall\".\nSince the horizontal part of the string fluctuates near the \"wall\", it experiences, at leading order approximation, a flat-space geometry. Note though, that the Dirichlet boundary\ncondition for heavy mesons exist solely because of the vertical gravitational potential. In\nthis sense, the leading order flat-space approximation refers only to the horizontal part of\nthe string. As the amplitudes of the fluctuations of the horizontal part of the string increase,\ncurvature effects set in and should be taken into account. Let us first discuss the flat-space\napproximation. In order to see when it makes sense to use it, a useful intermediate step is\nto introduce a coordinate\nU \u2212 U\u039b\n.\n(4.8)\n\u03b72 =\nU\u039b\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fThe expansion of the metric (2.1) around \u03b7 = 0 yields, to quadratic order [49],\n2\n\nds \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\nU\u039b\nR\n\n\u00133/2\n\n4\n3\n(1 + \u03b7 2 )(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dX \u03bc dX \u03bd ) + (R3 U\u039b )1/2 (d\u03b7 2 + \u03b7 2 d\u03b8 2 )\n2\n3\n1\n+ (R3 U\u039b )1/2 (1 + \u03b7 2 )d\u03a924 . (4.9)\n2\n\nWe now want to quantised the fluctuations of the rigid rotating rod solution which is sitting\nat the IR \"wall\" in the linearised metric (4.9). The solution is given by\nT = L\u03c4 ,\n\nX 1 = L sin \u03c4 sin \u03c3 ,\n\nX 2 = L cos \u03c4 sin \u03c3 ,\n\nU = U\u039b ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]. This same solution is valid both for the light and heavy mesons,\nsince there is no coupling between the fluctuations along the \"wall\" and direction transverse\nto it.\nThere are two ways to quantise fluctuation around (4.10): using the Nambu-Goto or\nthe Polyakov formulation. The main idea and subtleties related to the presence of the\nconstraints are reviewed in the appendix. The upshot of this analysis is that fluctuations\nin the directions X i transverse to the plane in which the string rotates (i.e. fluctuations\nin the direction of the brane X a , the radial direction Z and in the direction of internal\nsphere Y m ) are massless in the flat space approximation and become massive if the effects of\ncurvature are taken into account. The fluctuations in the direction of the angular coordinate\nin the plane where the string rotates are always massive, with a sigma-dependent mass\nterm. As explained before, the fluctuations in the direction of the \"wall\" are irrelevant\nfor the construction of the wave function. By expanding the Polyakov action around the\nsolution (4.10) and keeping all terms quadratic in \u03b7, we obtain the following action for the\nfluctuations in the \u03b7 and X \u03bc directions,\n1\nS=\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\nU\u039b\nR\n\n\u00133/2 Z\n\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0011 8\n3 2\n4 R3 \u0010 2\n\u20322\n2\n\u2212 b cos (\u03c3) 1 + \u03b7\n\u03b7\u0307 \u2212 \u03b7\nd\u03c4 d\u03c3\n3 U\u039b\n3\n2\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0011\u0015\n3 2\n\u03bd\u2032\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\u2032\n\u03b4\u1e8a \u03b4\u1e8a \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4X \u03b4X \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n, (4.11)\n+ 1+ \u03b7\n2\n\nwhere we have introduced a dimensionless quantity,\nb\u2261\n\n9 L2 U\u039b\n.\n16 R3\n\n(4.12)\n\nWe thus see that, unlike the linearised metric (4.9), the linearised action (4.11) in addition\nto the small parameter \u03b7 depends also on the extra parameter b, which specifies what kind\nof string we are considering. Thus various approximations will depend not only on the\nvalues of \u03b7, but also b and their relative ratio.\nTo get a feeling for the meaning of the parameter b, let us rewrite it as\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 \u00132\n9 \u03b1\u2032\nL\nL\n=\n,\n(4.13)\nb=\n2\nL\u039b\n16 R\n\u03b1\u2032eff\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fwhere L\u039b and R are defined in (2.3) and (2.5) respectively. We see that if b \u226a 1, the\nexpression (4.11) reduces to a flat-space action; this case will be considered in the following\nsection. As the size of the fluctuations is increased, the string starts to see the curvature\neffect; these additional corrections will be discussed in section 4.2.2. Note that the b \u226a 1\nregime is not compatible with the decoupling of the Kaluza-Klein states: b small implies\nthat the string is \"short\" enough to probe the extra compact directions (i.e. the energy\nof the string violates condition (2.4)). However, semiclassical treatment of the string still\nmakes sense, as one can make the string macroscopic (L2 \u226b \u03b1\u2032eff ). This is possible as long\nas the supergravity approximation is valid, i.e. as long as R2 \u226b \u03b1\u2032 , see (4.13).\nThe situation is very different if b \u223c 1. A flat space limit is not possible in this case,\nregardless of the size of the fluctuations. Despite the fact that the string is fully localised\nalong the \"wall\", and probes the transverse directions only via small fluctuations, if the\nlength of the string along the \"wall\" is large enough (in units of Kaluza-Klein radius L\u039b )\nthe string will always \"see\" curved transverse space. The reason for this is the potential\nterm b\u03b7 2 in the action (4.11) which cannot be neglected for the low frequency modes (i.e.\nwhen \u03b7\u0307 \u223c \u03b7 \u2032 \u223c \u03b7).8\n4.2.1 The flat space approximation\nAs explained before, the action (4.11) can be reduced to the flat space action when b \u226a 1.\nThough this condition violates the requirement that the Kaluza-Klein states decouple, this\nis a generic problem of present models and we will ignore it in what follows. Making\nthe fluctuations \u03b7 sufficiently small switches off all curvature and allows us to write the\nmetric (4.9) in a conformally flat form, by introducing a new radial coordinate z as\nr\n3 1/2 \u22123/2\nz.\n(4.16)\nU R\n\u03b7=\n4 \u039b\nThe metric then reduces to the simple form\n2\n\nds \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\nU\u039b\nR\n\n\u00133/2 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dX \u03bc dX \u03bd + dz 2 + (R3 U\u039b )1/2 d\u03a924 .\n\n(4.17)\n\n8\n\nThe action (4.11) was obtained by linearising the Polyakov action. In this approach, the constraints\nare easy to take care of at leading order (see the appendix), but become more complicated at higher orders.\nThe linearisation of the Nambu-Goto form leads to a more complicated action, but does not require any\nseparate treatment of the constraints. Therefore, studying the higher curvature effects may be simpler in\nthis approach.\nThe expansion the Nambu-Goto action in powers of \u03b7 has the schematic form\nS = b(q 2 + q 4 + . . . ) + (q 2 + q 4 + . . . ) + b\u22121 (q 4 + q 6 + . . . ) + b\u22122 (q 6 + q 8 + . . . ) + . . . .\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere q \u223c \u03b7 \u223c \u03b7\u0307 \u223c \u03b7 \u2032 . We thus see that the expansion in \u03b7 leads to a double expansion, in q and bq.\nHence, independent of whether b \u226a 1 or b \u226b 1, the parameter bq has to be much smaller than one for the\nsemiclassical expansion (4.14) to make sense. In addition, the flat space reduction makes sense if and only if\nq 4 /b \u226a q 2 \u226b bq 2\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nq2 \u226a b \u226a 1 .\n\n(4.15)\n\n\fIn this form it is immediately transparent that a string extended in the X and \u03b7 directions\n(but not in the four-sphere directions) will be described by a flat-space string action, but\nwith a string tension which is given by (2.11). The mass of a vertical string segment,\nstretching from the infrared \"wall\" to the flavour brane at z = zB , is then simply given by\nmq = Teff zB .\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe fluctuations in the direction of the angular coordinate in the plane where the string rotates are massive, with a sigma-dependent mass term. As explained before, the fluctuations\nin the direction of the \"wall\" are irrelevant for the construction of the wave function. By\nexpanding the Polyakov action around the solution (4.10), we obtain the following action\nfor the fluctuations in the direction transverse to the \"wall\"\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\nL\n2\n2\n(4.19)\ndT d\u03c3 \u2212(\u2202T z) + 2 (\u2202\u03c3 z) + . . . .\nSfluct =\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032eff\nL\nHere the dots refer to fluctuations in the directions along the \"wall\". Note that, by rotational symmetry, we can always align the system such that fluctuations in the \u03b8-direction\ndecouple. Taking into account the Dirichlet boundary conditions, the fluctuations z(\u03c3, \u03c4 )\ncan be written as\nX\nz(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) =\nzn cos(n\u03c3) .\n(4.20)\nn>0\n\nUsing this expression in the action and integrating over the \u03c3 coordinate, the action for\nthe fluctuations in the z-direction reduces to\n\"\n\u0013#\nZ\nX\u0012\nn2 2\nL\n2\n.\n(4.21)\ndT\n\u2212(\u2202T zn ) + 2 zn + . . .\nSfluct =\n2\u03b1\u2032eff\nL\nn>0\nThe main result which we deduce from this formula is that the system is equivalent to\nan infinite number of uncoupled linear harmonic oscillators, with frequencies n/L and\nmasses L/\u03b1\u2032eff . Note that the form of the action (4.21) (i.e. the values of the masses and\nthe frequencies of the linear harmonic oscillators) is gauge dependent. Thus to make computations more transparent, we have intentionally chosen the static gauge on the worldsheet,\nso that these worldsheet masses and frequencies coincide with their target space values.\nNote however, that the relevant combination m\u03c9 which appears in the wave function is a\ngauge invariant quantity.\nWe now write the wave function in the factorised form\n\u03a8({zn }, {xn }) = \u03a8long ({xn }) \u00d7 \u03a8sphere ({yn }) \u00d7 \u03a8\u03b8 ({\u03b8n }) \u00d7 \u03a8trans ({zn }) .\n\n(4.22)\n\nBecause the fluctuations along the \"wall\" and in the compact directions are irrelevant for\nthe computation of the probability that the string touches the flavour brane, one can simply\n\"integrate\" these out (and thus effectively set \u03a8long = \u03a8sphere = \u03a8\u03b8 = 1). The relevant,\ntransverse part of the wave function is now given by\n\u03a8[{zn }] =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nn=1\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\u03a80 (zn ) ,\n\n(4.23)\n\n\fwhere the wave functions for the individual modes are given by\n\u03a80 (zn ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u03c0\u03b1\u2032eff\n\n\u00131/4\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\nexp \u2212 \u2032 zn2 ,\n2\u03b1eff\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhere all coordinates zn are unconstrained (i.e. run from (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e)).9 Note that negative\nvalues of z correspond to a fluctuation of the string in antipodal directions on the cigar\n(antipodal points in \u03b8); see also the discussion of the geometry around (2.1). However,\nsince the flavour brane is a point in the \u03b8-direction, the fluctuations in the negative zdirection will not touch the flavour brane. Note that all oscillators are in the ground state,\nas classically none of the modes are excited in the z-direction.\nWe can obtain several estimates for the probability that the string touches the flavour\nbrane. These are all easiest to obtain by turning the problem upside down, and asking for\nbounds on the probability that the string does not touch the brane. A lower bound on\nthis probability is given by integrating over all values of the zn for which the sum of the zn\nsatisfy\nX\nzn \u2264 zB .\n(4.25)\nn>0\n\n(in words, this means that even if all modes add up constructively, the total amplitude is\nstill smaller than zB ).

The L-dependent prefactor in (4.7) will be\nmotivated further in section (4.3) from a full numerical analysis of the decay width using\na string bit model.

Let us first analyse the effects that the curvature\nhas on the decay width.\n4.2.2 Approximation using curved space\nIn this section we will discuss the effects of the curvature on the mesons decay widths.\nIn order to incorporate the leading effects of curvature, we use the expansion of the D4brane background (2.1) around the \"wall\" at U = U\u039b as given in (4.9). In contrast to the\nsituation discussed in section 4.2.1, we will now consider the \"full\" metric (4.9) rather than\nthe truncated one (4.17).\nWe now need to insert this metric in the string sigma model action and expand the\nlatter in small fluctuations around the classical, rotating, U-shaped solution (4.10). The\naction for the fluctuations in the \u03b7 direction becomes\n\"\n\u0012 \u00133/2 #\nZ\n\u0001\nU\u039b\n4 3\n1\n2\n(4.30)\n(R U\u039b )1/2 \u03b7\u0307 2 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212 3 L2 cos2 (\u03c3)\nd\u03c4 d\u03c3\n\u03b72 .\nS=\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1\n3\nR\nJust as for the closed, folded string analysed in [49], we now find an effective equation of\nmotion for the fluctuation in the \u03b7 direction which is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\nd2\nd2\n9 L2 U\u039b\n\u2212 2+ 2\u2212\n1 + cos(2\u03c3) \u03b7(\u03c4, \u03c3) = 0 .\n(4.31)\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c3\n8 R3\n\nWe want to know the solutions to this equation subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions,\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03b7(\u03c4, \u2212 ) = \u03b7(\u03c4, ) = 0 .\n(4.32)\n2\n2\nSolutions of (4.31) and (4.32) only exist if there is a non-zero and positive contribution\nto (4.31) coming from the \u2212d2 /d\u03c4 2 term. First, factorise the solution according to\n\u03b7(\u03c4, \u03c3) = ei\u03c9\u03c4 f (\u03c3) ,\n\n(4.33)\n\nwith a real frequency \u03c9. The resulting equation in \u03c3 is the Mathieu equation [5, 49]. The\nsolution which satisfies the boundary condition at the left end (i.e. \u03c3 = \u2212\u03c0/2) is given, up\n\n10\n\nWe should emphasise that we do not claim that the probability is well-approximated by a Gaussian for\nall values of zB . This would imply a finite value for the expectation value hzB i, but the expectation value in\nthe ground state is known to diverge [50]. Our results only show that for relatively small zB the probability\nis well-approximated by a Gaussian. At large distances the decay has to go slower than Gaussian to ensure\ndivergence of hzB i. However, the regime in which the Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov model has been tested\ncorresponds to small zB . We thank Ofer Aharony for discussions on this issue.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fto an overall multiplicative constant, by\nf (\u03c3) =\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\nb \u03c0\nb \u03c0\nb\nb\n2\n2\n2\n2\nC \u03c9 \u2212 b, , \u2212\nS \u03c9 \u2212 b, , \u03c3 \u2212 S \u03c9 \u2212 b, , \u2212\nC \u03c9 \u2212 b, , \u03c3 .

We now need to\ntune \u03c9 2 such that the boundary condition at the right end (i.e.\u03c3 = \u03c0/2) is satisfied.\nThis boundary condition at \u03c3 = \u03c0/2 can be satisfied by making use of the Mathieu\ncharacteristic functions an (q) and bn (q), which give the value of the first parameter of the\neven and odd Mathieu functions respectively, such that they are periodic with period 2\u03c0n.\nWe use the following properties of the Mathieu functions,\nS(an (q), q, \u00b1\u03c0/2) = S(bn (q), q, \u00b1\u03c0/2) = 0\n\nfor even n,\n\nC(an (q), q, \u00b1\u03c0/2) = C(bn (q), q, \u00b1\u03c0/2) = 0\n\nfor odd n.\n\n(4.35)\n\nThese properties imply that for even n, the second term of (4.34) vanishes and the first one\nsatisfies both boundary conditions. For odd n, the situation is reversed, and the first term\nin (4.34) vanishes altogether while the second term satisfies both boundary conditions. We\nthus see that the boundary condition at \u03c3 = \u03c0/2 is satisfied for any of the frequencies\n\u03c9n2 = an (b/2) + b\n\nfor n \u2265 0 ,\n\n\u03c9n2 = bn (b/2) + b\n\nfor n > 0 .\n\n(4.36)\n\nThis spectrum has been plotted in figure 9. At leading order these frequencies behave\nlike n2 but there are b-dependent (and thus L-dependent) corrections.\nKnowing the frequencies of the modes, we can write down the corresponding harmonic\noscillator system. By writing the action (4.30) in terms of the target-space time T and\nusing the equation of motion to eliminate (after partial integration) the \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 term, we find\n#\n\"\nZ\nX \u0012 d\u03b7n \u00132 \u03c9 2\nL 4 3\n(4.37)\n\u2212 n2 \u03b7n2 ,\n(R U\u039b )1/2 dT\nS=\n2\u03b1\u2032 3\ndT\nL\nn\nwhere \u03b7n denotes the amplitude of the n-th mode (observe that there are actually two\nmodes for all n \u2265 1).

In order to get a better\nfeeling for the physics stored in the wave function, let us rewrite the b parameter, using\nthe value valid for low-mass quarks (2.13), in terms of gauge theory quantities.

One should,\nhowever, keep in mind that both in the old string model and in our setup, the corrections\ndue to finite quark masses (3.6) tend to enhance the decay as J increases. There are thus\ntwo competing effects. Unfortunately, the experimental data of the decay of high-spin\nmesons into other high-spin mesons is rather scarce. We will return to a comparison with\nexperiment in section 5.\n4.3 Approximation using a string bit model in flat space\nSo far, we have used a continuum description to determine the decay width. However,\nan alternative way to set up the computation is to use a discrete approximation, where\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fzB\n\nx1\n\na\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\u2212zB\n\nL\nFigure 11: The discretised string, consisting of a number of horizontal rigid rod segments\n(blue) connected by vertical springs. Also depicted are the flavour brane at z = zB ; this\nflavour brane has a finite width.\n\ninstead of a continuum string one uses a set of beads and springs. This of course introduces a\ncertain approximation, but it has the advantage that the integration over the right subset of\nconfiguration space becomes much more manageable. As a result, we obtain an independent\nverification of the decay rates obtained in the previous sections.\nThe situation we will consider is as in figure 11. We will again make the approximation\nin which the string is very close to the \"wall\", so that the metric becomes flat, as in (4.17).\nThe string tension of the string bit model should thus be taken equal to Teff given in (2.11).\nWe now want to compute the probability that, when the system is in the ground state,\none or more beads are at the brane at x = zB . In order to write down the wave function\nas a function of the positions xi of the beads, we have to go to normal coordinates in\nwhich the equations of motion decouple. Denote the string tension by Teff , the number\nof beads by N , their individual masses by M and the length of the system by L, which\nsatisfies L = a (N + 1). The action is given by\n!\nZ\nN +1\nN\nX\n\u00012\n1\nTeff X\n2\nS=\ndt\nM \u1e8bn \u2212\n,\n(4.40)\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121\n2\na\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nwhere xN +1 \u2261 0.

For each bead position, we define the\nintegration intervals corresponding to being \"at the brane\" and being \"elsewhere in space\"\nby\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\nIbrane : \u2212 zB \u2212 \u2206, \u2212zB \u222a zB , zB + \u2206 ,\n(4.48)\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\nIspace : \u2212 \u221e, \u2212zB \u2212 \u2206 \u222a \u2212 zB , zB \u222a zB + \u2206, \u221e .\nHere \u2206 is the width of the flavour brane, which of course has to be taken equal to a finite\nvalue in order to be left with a finite probability. The probability of finding a configuration\nwhich has, e.g., one bead at the brane and all others away from it, is then given by\nP(one bead at brane) =\nN Z\nX\ni=1\n\nIbrane\n\ndxi\n\nYZ\n\nk6=i Ispace\n\n\u0001\ndxk J {y1 , y2 , . . . , yN }, {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN }\n\u00012\n\u00d7 \u03a8 {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN } . (4.49)\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fThe factor J is a Jacobian arising from the change of normal coordinates to the original\npositions of the beads (and which is just a constant since the transformation is linear, so\nit can be computed by demanding that the integral of |\u03a8|2 over the full x-space is equal to\none). Similar expressions exists for other subsets of configuration space where more than\none bead is located at the brane.\nLet us now consider the simplest decay process, namely the one-meson to two-meson\nprocess. The total decay width is a sum of decay widths labelled by the number of beads\nwhich are at the brane,\nX (p)\n\u0393meson\u21922 mesons =\n\u0393meson\u21922 mesons .\n(4.50)\np\n\nwhere the partial width \u0393(p) is given by\nX\n(p)\np * Pconfiguration * Teff Psplit * length per bead . (4.51)\n\u0393meson\u21922 mesons =\nall configurations\nwith p beads at brane\n\nThe factor p occurs because a configuration with p beads at the brane can decay in p different ways into a two-string configuration. The symbol Psplit is the dimensionless coefficient\nrelated to the decay width of open strings, as described around (4.4).\nIn the discrete picture, it is easy to see that the decay width grows linearly with the\nlength of the string. Namely, consider the system with Teff fixed and N fixed (and large\nin the continuum limit). The total length (and thus the total mass) is now changed by\nvarying the spacing a. The partial decay width \u0393(1) , for instance, is given by\n(1)\n\u0393meson\u21922 mesons\n\n=\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nPbead i at brane * Teff Psplit * a\n\nN +1\nN\n\n\u2248 Pone bead at brane * Teff Psplit * L , (4.52)\nwhere the last equality holds when the probability to sit at the brane is approximately the\nsame for all beads (recall, in this context, the discussion in section 4.1). In fact, as long as\nP\ni Pbead i at brane scales linearly in N , one obtains a linear dependence of the decay width\non L. For the partial width \u0393(N ) the proportionality with L is in actually trivial,\n(N )\n\n\u0393meson\u21922 mesons = N * Pall beads at brane * Teff Psplit * a\n\nN +1\nN\n\n= Pall beads at brane * Teff Psplit * L . (4.53)\nLet us now analyse the total decay width. Clearly, integrals of the type (4.49) are\ncomplicated because they involve exponentials which are not decoupled Gaussians (alternatively one could of course integrate directly over the ym , as in the continuum discussion,\nbut then one has to deal with complicated boundary conditions). However, one can certainly do these integrals numerically using Monte-Carlo integration.\nWith such a numerical integration process, we have obtained results which are close to\nthe ones which we obtained using approximation methods in the continuum.

Superposed is a best-fit Gaussian, with parameters \u0393 = 0.12 exp(\u22121.22 zB\n/\u03b1\u2032eff ).\nThe string is allowed to split if a bead is at the brane, but the other beads are allowed to\nbe anywhere (both below and above the brane).\n\nof the decay width of a six-bead system is given in figure 12.

It is perhaps good to emphasise\nthat this shape of the decay width is only obtained when \"being at the brane\" and \"being\nsomewhere else\" is defined as in (4.48). If one allows the string to split not only when\na bead is at the brane, but also when the bead is above the brane, the decay width is\nqualitatively different. A different result is also obtained if one disallows the string to split\nwhen any of the beads is above the brane. See figure 14 for details.\nThe result (4.54) is to be compared with the result of the Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov\nmodel, given by (3.2). By using expression (4.18) for the mass of the produced quarks\nin terms of the distance between the \"wall\" and the flavour brane, we see that the decay\nwidth in their model, when translated into string theory variables, is given by\n\u0012\n2 \u0013\n1 zB\n\u0393CNN = const. * exp \u2212 \u2032\n* Teff Psplit * L .\n(4.55)\n4 \u03b1eff\n11\n\nAfter completion of this work we learned that a very similar calculation was done, analytically, in the\nappendix of [40], though with an entirely different, non-holographic underlying picture.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fGaussian exponent\n1.5\n\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nN\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 13: The behaviour of the scale of the Gaussian shape of the decay width as a\nfunction of the number of beads N .

However, we should perhaps not be\ntoo surprised about this, given the fact that it is not entirely clear yet whether the mass\nappearing in (2.9) is constituent, current or something in between.\nFinally, let us remark once more that the results obtained with the string bit model\nsupport the assumptions made in section 4.1, in particular those which lead to the conclusion that the decay width is linear in the length of the string.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\f5. Summary of the results and comparison with experiment\nIn this section we will summarise the results obtained throughout the paper, and compare\nthem with the available experimental data. Since our construction is very generic (i.e. it\ndoes not crucially rely on the details of the geometry dual to QCD) we focus on the\nqualitative features of the decay width as they follow from our model, rather than on exact\nnumbers.\nIn this paper we have studied decays of two types of high-spin mesons: those consisting\nof two heavy or two light quarks. These mesons were modelled by classical, open U-shaped\nstrings (see figure 1) with long and short vertical parts, respectively. The main idea for the\ncomputation of meson decay widths was to study the fluctuations of the horizontal part of\nthe U-shaped string in the direction transverse to the \"wall\", and from there deduce the\nprobability that the string touches the flavour probe brane (see figure 2). This probability\nwas then multiplied with the probability for the string to reconnect with the probe, using\nthe flat space results for string decay widths of [8].\nIn order to compute the probability for the transverse fluctuations we had to construct the string wave function (4.1), for which it was necessary to perform a semi-classical\nquantisation of the string fluctuations around the classical U-shaped configuration. Given\nthat the full confining background (2.1) is complicated, and that we are anyhow mainly\ninterested in infrared phenomena of the theory, we have focused in all our computations\nonly on the region near the \"wall\".\nThe description of the U-shaped strings also simplifies in this approximation. Both\nfor mesons with heavy quarks and for mesons with light quarks, the horizontal part of the\nU-shaped string can be modelled as an open string with Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nthe \"wall\". This is obvious for the mesons with light quarks (where the flavour brane is on\nthe \"wall\"). For mesons with heavy quarks the vertical parts of the string cannot easily\nfluctuate in the transverse direction in the full geometry due to their weight, and thereby\nimpose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the endpoints of the horizontal segment. Note\nthough, that the Dirichlet boundary condition for heavy mesons exist solely because of the\nvertical gravitational potential. At leading order, the horizontal part of the string undergoes\nfluctuations near the wall just like in flat space. As the amplitude of the fluctuations is\nincreased, the curvature effects can be taken into account perturbatively.\nWithin the frame work of these approximations the decay width \u0393flat for heavy, highspin mesons (4.29) was shown to exhibit a) linear dependence on the string length (i.e. the\nmass of the meson) b) exponential suppression with the masses of the produced quarks\nc) flavour conservation, d) suppression in the large-Nc limit and e) the Zweig rule. The\nthird feature is automatically built into the setup, and corresponds to the geometrical fact\nthat when a string splits, it produces two endpoints on the same brane. The suppression\nin the large-Nc limit follows from the fact that reconnection of the string to the brane is an\nopen string process, and thus is weighted with a gs \u223c 1/Nc factor. The Zweig rule, which\nis not automatic in the Lund model, is similarly a simple consequence of the holographic\ndescription of mesons. Processes violating the Zweig rule (see section 3.3) would involve\nsimultaneous annihilation of the endpoints of the open string and splitting of the string in\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\f\u0393/M\nK4\u2217 (2045)\n\n0.1\n\nK3\u2217 (1780)\n\nPSfrag replacements 0.08\n\nK5\u2217 (2380)\nK2\u2217 (1430)\n\n0.06\n\nK \u2217 (892)\n\n0.04\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nM (GeV)\n\nFigure 15: The decay width divided by the mass of the mesons on the K \u2217 trajectory, versus the mass of the states [52]. These satisfy \u0393/M = const. only very approximately. Also\ndepicted is a fit based on the assumption of a constant width per unit length, i.e. \u0393 \u223c L,\ntogether with the finite quark mass relation between the length and the mass, (3.6). Our\nmodel based on the gauge/string duality predicts a lower decay width at higher spin, but\nthe data are too scarce to say anything conclusive about such corrections.\n\nthe middle, and are thus suppressed by extra powers of the string coupling constant.\nThese first three of the features listed above are in very good agreement with the\nexperimentally tested Lund model formula (4.55) as computed in [37]. In relation to the\nexponential suppression of \u0393, we should in particular note that the quark masses which\nfigure in the Lund result (4.55) are the so-called \"constituent\" quark masses, i.e. masses\nwhich are of the order of hadronic masses (for example \u223c 300 MeV for u, d quarks, and\n\u223c 500 MeV for the s quarks [37]). In our model the mass figuring in the exponent is related\nto the mass of the vertical parts of the string, and thus corresponds to the constituent mass\nrather than the current algebra mass. The latter is related to the asymptotic separation\nof the D4 and D6-branes (i.e. to the parameter r\u221e in figure 3).12\nThe main differences between our results and those of the Lund model are contained in\nthe precise form of the exponent, in particular in the dependence on the spin of the initial\nmeson. Let us explain what we mean here more precisely. However, as a general remark,\nnote that the fine structure of the exponent in (4.55) has not been extensively tested in\nexperiments so far and in particular not for the decay of high-spin mesons.\nThe quantity which can be extracted experimentally is \u0393/M , where \u0393 is the partial\ndecay width and M the mass of the initial meson. The Lund formula (4.55) and our flat\nspace results both imply that the ratio \u0393/L is constant on the same Regge trajectory,\nsee (4.54) and (4.55). Here L is the length of the horizontal part of the U-shaped string,\ni.e. the length of the flux tube in the Lund model. Thus, if one approximates mesonic\n12\n\nNote that even if r\u221e = 0, the constituent quark masses are non-zero, corresponding to the fact that\nthe non-flat profile of the D6-brane, as depicted in figure 3, persists even in this case.\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fRegge trajectories with straight lines (i.e uses the condition M = Teff L), then we expect\nthat the ratio \u0393/M is constant on a Regge trajectory. The experimental data however,\nsupport this statement only very approximately (see for example the decay widths for the\nK \u2217 trajectory in figure 15).\nThere are at least two ways in which the observed deviations from constant \u0393/M could\nbe incorporated in the model. One way is by incorporating the fact that in nature, Regge\ntrajectories are not straight lines and the relation between the meson mass and the effective\nstring \"length\" L is modified, due to the presence of massive quark endpoints (3.6).13 This\nkinematical effect is automatically incorporated for our U-shaped string, since the U-shaped\nstring satisfies (3.6). Note that this effect means that for fixed energy, the string length\nis shorter, and hence the meson is more stable than with massless quarks. As the spin of\nmesons is increased, this effect is \"washed\" out, as the energy stored in the string becomes\nmuch larger than the energy of the quarks. The correction to \u0393/M due to the finite quark\nmasses indeed seems to be in much better agreement with the experimental data, see for\ninstance the fit to the widths of the K \u2217 trajectory in figure 15.\nThe other reason for deviation of \u0393/M from a constant value could be a modification\nto the exponential factor for the decay rates. In the \"standard\" Lund model the ratio \u0393/M\nis \"blind\" to the value of the spin of the mesons. The same is true for our model in the flat\nspace approximation, since the probabilities for the fluctuations in the direction transverse\nto the \"wall\" were independent of the spin (i.e. length) of the classical string (4.24). However, both the Lund model and our setup allow for an improvement of the exponential term\nto incorporate spin effects. In the Lund model the Schwinger pair production in the flux\ntube is modified due to the presence of a centrifugal barrier (see (3.7) and the discussion\naround it). This effect leads to a stabilisation of mesons with the increase of their spin. In\nour setup, inclusion of curvature terms leads to the effect that fluctuations in the transverse\ndirection become dependent on the properties of the string around which they are excited\n(see (4.11)). The leads to a twofold effect (4.38). Firstly, for a given meson, the lifetime\nis increased as compared to the prediction in flat space, i.e. as compared to the simple\nLund approximation (it becomes harder to fluctuate in the transverse direction due to the\n\"positive\" curving of the space). Secondly, for a given trajectory, the mesons become more\nstable as their spin is increased. We would like to emphasise that the direction in which\nthese corrections act is very generic, and basically independent of the particular model\nunder consideration. Since both our model and the improved Lund model seem to predict\nsimilar behaviour of the decay rates of high-spin mesons (namely that they do not decay\nas fast as the naive Lund model predicts), it would be extremely interesting to see whether\nexperimental data offers support for this behaviour. More precise data to be collected in\nthe future will hopefully allow for more detailed tests of the exponential factors, and thus\nallow one to discriminate between various models.\n13\n\nThis simple mechanism cannot be used to explain deviations from the straight line for the Pomeron\ntrajectory (which corresponds to a closed string). In this case, the one-loop world-sheet corrections do,\nhowever, modify the relation in the right direction [5]. Similar worldsheet quantum effects also modify the\nRegge trajectories for mesons, but are much less relevant than the classical corrections due to the quark\nmasses.\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Johanna Erdmenger, Sergey Frolov, Vadim Kaplunovsky, Shmuel\nNussinov, Jan Plefka, Jorge Russo, Diana Vaman and Shimon Yankielowicz for discussions.\nWe would especially like to thank Ofer Aharony for comments on the manuscript, and\nStefano Kovacs for participation at early stages of this project.

Appendix\nA.1 Semiclassical quantisation of macroscopic strings\nIn this appendix we discuss the general formalism required for quantisation of fluctuations\nof the string around a given classical solution. Most of this is based on appendix A of Frolov\nand Tseytlin [53].\nOne starts from the Polyakov string action in a curved background, gauge-fixed to a\nconformal worldsheet metric,\n1\nS=\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032\n0\n\nh\ni\nd\u03c3 GM N \u1e8a M \u1e8a N \u2212 X M \u2032 X N \u2032 .\n\n(A.1)\n\nIn order to write down the lowest-energy state of the system, we have to find an expression\nfor operator corresponding to the space-time energy of a string state. So we assume that the\ntarget-space metric has been written proper-time form, G0i = 0, and that all components\nare independent of time so that it admits a time-like Killing vector. The energy operator\nis then given by P0 , or\nZ 2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032\n\u22121\nd\u03c3 Gtt \u1e6b .\n(A.2)\nE = P0 =\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 0\nUsing the Virasoro constraint, this expression can be converted to an expression which\ninvolves the oscillators. The constraint reads\nh\ni\ni\nj\n\u2212Gtt \u1e6b2 + Gij \u1e8a i \u1e8a j + X \u2032 X \u2032 = 0 .\n(A.3)\nNow first expand the time coordinate around its classical value t = L\u03c4 + t\u0303. The constraint (A.3) then allows one to derive the expression\nGtt \u1e6b =\n\n1\n1\nLGtt + H(t\u0303, X, Y, Z) .\n2\nL\n\nHere H(t\u0303, X, Y, Z) is the world-sheet Hamiltonian density,\nh\ni\ni\nj\nH(t\u0303, X, Y, Z) = \u2212Gtt t\u0303 \u03072 + Gij \u1e8a i \u1e8a j + X \u2032 X \u2032 .\n\n(A.4)\n\n(A.5)\n\nNow also expand the other fields around the classical solution, i.e.\nX i = X0i + X\u0303 i ,\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhere X0i can for instance be the solution given in (4.10). Upon integration over the \u03c3\ncoordinate, the terms linear in the fluctuations integrate to zero, so that the result becomes\n1\nE = const. +\nL\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032\n0\n\nd\u03c3 H(T\u0303 , X\u0303, \u1ef8 , Z\u0303) .\n\n(A.7)\n\nThis is the classical expression for which we want to write down the corresponding quantum\noperator and the lowest-eigenvalue eigenstate.\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fA.2 Decays of massive open strings in flat space-time\nWe briefly review here the decay of open bosonic strings and the type-I superstrings via a\nsplit into two open strings. We follow the papers [8, 46].\nIntuitively, the string can split at any point of it and hence one expects that the decay\nrate will be proportional to the length of the string \u0393 \u223c L. This property was indeed\nproved for the bosonic critical open [8, 54] and closed string [46] as well as for the critical\nsuperstring theory [55, 56]. The idea is to use the optical theorem and compute the total\ndecay rate by taking the imaginary part of the self energy function. Whereas in [46, 54] the\nannulus diagram associated with the split and rejoining of an open string was computed,\nthe authors of [8] use a trick and translate the problem into that of disk amplitude with\ntwo closed string vertex operators. This is done by assuming one compact space dimension\nof period L around which the initial and final string are wound. So the process is that of\nan incoming closed string that opens up and then closes again to yield an outgoing closed\nstring.\nThe corresponding amplitude takes the form\n\u0014\n\u00152 Z\niT N\n\u03ba\n\u221a\niA = 2 L\nd2 z h: eip0 X(0) :: e\u2212ip0 X(z) :i ,\ng\n2\u03c0 L\n|z|<1\n\n(A.8)\n\nwhere g is the coefficient of the open string tachyon operator, \u03ba is the gravitational coupling,\nthe normalisation factor iT N/g 2 is determined by calculating the amplitude of a graviton\nto couple to two open string tachyons, the factor L comes from the zero modes along\n\u221a\nthe compact direction and the 1/ L factor for each vertex operator follows from the\nnormalisation of the centre of mass wave function of the string. By using the operator\nproduct expansions of the left and right-moving modes of the string one finds that the\nintegrand of (A.8) is given by\nh: eip0 X(0) :: e\u2212ip0 X(z) :i = |zz\u0304|\u22122 (1 \u2212 zz\u0304)\u2212\u03b3 ,\n\n(A.9)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03b3 = L2\u03c0T \u2212 2. Performing the integral, taking the imaginary part of the amplitude\nand using Stirling's approximation one finds that\nIm A = \u2212\n\nT N \u03ba2\n\u03b3\n2g2\n\n(A.10)\n\nwhich means that in the large-L limit the decay rate equals [8]\n\u0393 = \u2212 Im \u03b4m = \u2212\n\n1\nT N \u03ba2\nT N \u03ba2\ng2 T 13\nIm A =\n\u03b3\n\u2192\nL\n=\nNL .\n2m\n4g2 E\n8\u03c0g2\n226 \u03c0 12\n\n(A.11)\n\nIn the last step \u03ba was expressed in terms of g2 and T using either unitarity, careful treatment\nof the path integral normalisation, or by factorisation of the annulus amplitude. The decay\nrate is thus linear in the length of the string. Using the relation between the length, the\nmass and the excitation level M 2 = n/\u03b1\u2032 = L2 /\u03b1\u20322 it is clear that the decay rate is also\nlinear in the mass of the string, and goes with the square root of the excitation level.\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\f111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111\n\nFigure 16: The setup for the computation of the open string decay width as used by Dai\nand Polchinski [8].\n\nEventually the decay rate has units of time\u22121 \u223c M so we rewrite (A.11) in the following\nform\n1\n\u221a M,\n(A.12)\n\u0393=\n\u03c0 23 245\nwhere, following [8], the decay rate of (A.11) was multiplied by\n\n16\u03c0 \u221a 1\ng 2 N (\u03c0T )25 .\n\nThe calculations of Turok et al. [46, 54] include the evaluation of the planar contribution\nto the self energy. The self energy which is related to the shift of the trajectory has threshold\ncuts along the positive mass-squared axis, and the discontinuity across the cut gives the\ndecay rate. To determine the values of the decay rates of the asymptotically high-mass\nstates, the method of stationary phase was used to compute the self energy integrals in\nthe upper and lower half planes. It was shown that the decay rates are independent of the\nendpoint charges, namely the decay of the different gauge representation are the same.\nThe decay rate of [54] does not agree in general with the one computed by [8], as the\nformer paper finds a decay rate which is not (at leading order) linear in the length L of the\nstring. However, the disagreement disappears in the critical dimension (see the note added\nin proof in [54]). Since the two methods of calculations used in [8] and [46, 54] are different,\nthe fact that the results agree in the critical dimension is significant. In particular it seems\nto imply that the impact of the endpoints is not important and indeed the split is a local\nproperty. If this conclusion is correct, it is more probable that the massive endpoints of\nour open strings would not dramatically influence the probability to split.\n\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1] T.
