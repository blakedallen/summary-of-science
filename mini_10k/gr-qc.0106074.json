INTRODUCTION\n\nThe inflationary universe scenario has become an integral part of the standard model of universe. It does resolve\nthe outstanding problems of the standard model like the flatness problem, the horizon problem, the homogeneity and\nisotropy problem etc. It also provides an important clue for the origin of structure formation in the universe [1,2, 3] .\nThe underlying idea of inflation is that there was an epoch when the universe was slowly rolling down the flat wings\nof the scalar potential such that vacuum energy was dominant leading to the exponential growth of the scale factor.\nAt the end of slow roll, the universe falls into the core of the potential and fast oscillates near the minimum leading\nto the re-heating ultimately. Damour and Mukhanov have discussed the possibility of inflation during the period of\noscillations [ 4 ] . Further discussion on the same theme can be found in reference [ 5 ]. In fact, such a possibility was\nfirst pointed out by Turner[ 6 ]. Inflation with oscillation can be realized by a non-convex potential V (\u03c6) ( V,\u03c6\u03c6 < 0)\nwith small convex core near the minimum of the potential and with large flat wings such that universe spends most\nof the time away from the core and inflates. In this paper we study general aspects of inflation during oscillations .\nWe derive general expression for the number of e-folds which reduce to the standard formula in the slow role regime\nand leads to the Damour-Mukhanov type expression for slowly varying adiabatic index. We apply our result to the\nlogarithmic potential and show that the model exhibits simple analytical solution which has remarkable agreement\nwith the numerical simulation.\nII. EVOLUTION EQUATIONS AND CRITERIA OF INFLATION WITH OSCILLATIONS:\n\nThe field evolution equations in the Freedman cosmology have the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd 1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V = \u22123H \u03c6\u03072\ndt 2\nH2 =\n\n8\u03c0\n\u03c1\n3M 2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u22123H(\u03c1 + p) = \u22123H \u03c6\u03072\n\n(3)\n\n4\u03c0\n\u00e4\n(\u03c1 + 3p)\n=\u2212\na\n3M 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1=\n\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6)\n2\n\n(5)\n\np=\n\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n2\n\n(6)\n\nEquations (3) and (4) are not independent of (1) and (2) but will be useful in view of forthcoming discussion. Equation\n2\n(3) reveals that the energy density in scalar field \u03c6 decreases because of the red shifting away of the kinetic part \u03c6\u03072 .\n1\n\n\fIn what follows , we shall assume that the potential is even and has minimum at \u03c6 = 0 . When the field initially being\ndisplaced from the minimum of the potential, rolls below its slow roll value, the coherence oscillation regime \u03c9 >> H\ncommences. The evolution equation can then be approximately solved by separating the two times scales namely the\nfast oscillation time scale and the longer expansion time scale. On the first time scale, the Hubble expansion can be\nneglected, and one obtain \u03c6 as a function of time;\nZ\n1\nt \u2212 t0 = \u00b1 p\nd\u03c6,\n(7)\n2(Vm \u2212 V (\u03c6))\n\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 Vm \u2261 V (\u03c6m ) ; Vm being the maximum current value of the potential energy and \u03c6m being the field\namplitude . On the longer time scale \u03c1 and \u03c6m slowly decrease because Hubble damping term in equation ( 1 ) .The\naverage adiabatic index \u03b3 is defined as ,\n\u001d * 2+\n\u001c\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u03c1+p\n=\n(8)\n\u03b3=\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nwhere< . > denotes the time average over one oscillation . Equation (4) then tells that expansion during oscillations\nwould continue (\u00e4 > 0) if \u03b3 < 32 . The adiabatic evolution of a(t) and \u03c1 is given by ,\n2\n\nAs \u03c6\u0308 =\n\n\u2212dV\nd\u03c6\n\n,the condition \u03b3 <\n\n2\n3\n\na(t) \u221d t 3\u03b3\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c1 \u2261 V (\u03c6m ) \u221d t\u22122\n\n(10)\n\ncan equivalently be written [ 6 ] ,\n\u03b3=\n\n=\n\n*\n\n\u03c6\u03072\n\u03c1\n\n+\n\n=\n\n< \u03c6V,\u03c6 >\n<V >\n= 2(1 \u2212\n)\nVm\nVm\n\nR \u03c6m\n\n1\n\n(1 \u2212 V (\u03c6)/Vm ) 2 d\u03c6\n2 R \u03c60m\n1\n(1 \u2212 V (\u03c6)/Vm )\u2212 2 d\u03c6\n0\n\n<\n\n2\n3\n\n(11)\n\nIt is suggestive to write (11) in an equivalent form,\n\nhU (\u03c6)i \u2261 hV \u2212 \u03c6V,\u03c6 i > 0\n\n(12)\n\nThe expression (12) has a simple geometric meaning; the average over one oscillation of the intercept U(\u03c6) at \u03c6 should\nbe positive to ensure accelerated expansion. In models of inflation with oscillation the slow roll value of the field \u03c6s is\n\" far away\" from convex core given by \u03c6c such thathU i is positive before \u03c6 rolls below certain critical value of the field\n\u03c6cr Fig.1 . As a result the universe undergoes accelerated expansion (\u00e4 > 0). This is because the average of intercept\nU (\u03c6) is negative for 0 < \u03c6 < \u03c6c and the positive contribution to < U (\u03c6) > starts coming only as \u03c6 gets bigger than\n\u03c6c . Obviously one has to take \u03c6 further to some \u03c6cr in order to cancel the negative contribution to < U (\u03c6) > coming\nfrom the convex core . In certain sense the \u03c6cr defines the effective size of convex core . Clearly , as \u03c6 rolls below\n\u03c6cr , the average of U (\u03c6) over one oscillation turns negative and consequently inflation ceases loosing to oscillations\nwithout accelerated expansion . Hence for inflation to occur during oscillations , the field amplitude \u03c6m should very\nbetween \u03c6cr and \u03c6s . We shall call this regime \" oscillatory inflation regime \" .\n\n2\n\n\fV/V0\n\n\u03c6c\n\n\u03c6 cr\n\n\u03c6s\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 1. Qualitative picture of an effective potential showing the intercept U (\u03c6) of the tangent to the curve V (\u03c6) at various\nvalues of the field \u03c6.For \u03c6 < \u03c6c ,the value of the intercept is negative . U (\u03c6)is positive for \u03c6 > \u03c6c . The critical field \u03c6cr is fixed\nsuch that the positive contribution coming from the interval \u03c6c < \u03c6 < \u03c6cr to the average intercept hU (\u03c6)i exactly cancel the\nnegative contribution of the convex core . hU (\u03c6)i is positive as \u03c6 varies between \u03c6cr and \u03c6s and the universe expands in this\nregime called the \"oscillatory inflation regime \".\n\nIII. MODEL:\n\nWe shall study here the logarithmic potential which may implement inflation with oscillations,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nV (\u03c6) = V0 ln 1 + (\u03c6/\u03c6c )2 )\n\nThis is the q tending to zero limit of the potential suggested by Damour and Mukhanov,\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u0013q/2\n\u03c62\nV0\n+1\n\u22121\nV (\u03c6) =\nq\n\u03c62c\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThe potential has a convex core near the bottom of potential given by \u03c6c whereas V,\u03c6\u03c6 is negative away from the\ncore. For \u03c6 >> \u03c6c ,V (\u03c6) = 2V0 ln(\u03c6/\u03c6c ) and consequently \u03b3 \u2243 1/ ln(\u03c6m /\u03c6c ) \u2261 1/ ln(\u03b2)\nA. critical value of field\n\nIn order to compute the size of inflation , it would be necessary to determine hU i :\nhU i =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(V (x, \u03b2) \u2212 xV,x (x, \u03b2))dx\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2261 \u03c6m /\u03c6c , x \u2261 \u03c6/\u03c6m and V (x, \u03b2) = V0 ln(1 + \u03b2 2 x2 ) in case of the potential given by ( 13 ). Since only the\nsigh of hU i is important we have omitted several positive constants in the expression( 15 ) . The average intercept\nhU i is plotted in Fig. 2 in case of the logarithmic potential under consideration .The value of \u03b2 where hU i changes\nsign precisely determines the critical value of the field or equivalently \u03b2cr .For the logarithmic potential \u03b2cr turns out\nto be nearly equal to 3.2.\n\n3\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.3\n\n<U>\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\u03b2\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2.

Number of e-folds:\n\nThe number of e-folds is defined by ,\nN = ln\n\naf\n,\nai\n\n(18)\n\nSince the scale factor \"a\" depends upon \u03c6m or equivalently upon \u03b2, ( 18 ) should be used carefully . We divide the\ninterval [\u03b2cr , \u03b2s ] into small slices , \u2206\u03b2j = \u03b2j+1 \u2212 \u03b2j with j = 1, M such that \u03b21 = \u03b2cr and \u03b2M = \u03b2s .The number of\ne-foldings obtained for the interval \u2206\u03b2j is given by ,\nN (\u03b2j )\u2206\u03b2j = \u2212 ln\n\na(\u03b2j+1 )\na(\u03b2j )\n\nwhere aj+1 < aj for universe rolling down from \u03b2s to\u03b2cr using ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) leads to the following expression ,\nNj \u2206\u03b2j =\n\n1\nln (V (\u03b2j+1 )/V (\u03b2j ))\n3\u03b3(\u03b2)\n\nExpanding V (\u03b2j+1 ) in Teller series in the neighborhood of \u03b2j and using ln(1 + x) \u2243 x for x << 1 we get ,\n4\n\n\fNj \u2206\u03b2j =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n3\u03b3(\u03b2j )\n\n\u0013\n\nV \u2032 (\u03b2j )\n\u2206\u03b2j\nV (\u03b2j )\n\n(19)\n\nIntegrating ( 19 ) from \u03b2cr to \u03b2s one obtains the total number of e-foldings ,\nN=\n\n\u03b2s\n\nZ\n\nN (\u03b2)d\u03b2\n\n\u03b2cr\n\nwhere\nN (\u03b2) =\n\nV \u2032 (\u03b2)/V (\u03b2)\n3\u03b3(\u03b2)\n\nN (\u03b2) can be interpreted as the density of e-foldings with regard to \u03b2. The correct definition , however , should take\ninto account the change in the comoving Hubble length [ 7 ] ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\na f Hf\n\u00d1 = ln\n(20)\na i Hi\nSimilar arguments as above can be used to obtain the expression for\u00d1 ,\n\u00d1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2s\n\n\u00d1 (\u03b2)d\u03b2\n\n(21)\n\n\u0013\n1\n1 V \u2032 (\u03b2)\n\u2212\n3\u03b3(\u03b2) 2 V (\u03b2)\n\n(22)\n\n\u03b2cr\n\nwhere\n\u00d1 (\u03b2) =\n\n\u0012\n\nExpression ( 22 ) formally written for oscillatory regime presents a general result for the number e-foldings . In fact\n,in slow roll approximation ,\n\u03c6\u03072 /2 \u2212 V\n\u03c6\u03072\n\u03b3=\n+1\u2243\n\u2243\nV\n\u03c6\u03072 /2 + V\n\n\u0012\n\nM2\n24\u03c0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nV\u2032\nV\n\n\u00132\n\nSubstituting this expression in ( 22 ) leads to the standard formula for the number of e-foldings [ 2 ].Needless to say\nthat \u00d1 nearly coincides with N in case of the slow role regime .In case \u03b3 is a slowly varying function of \u03b2, \u00d1 assumes\nthe following form ,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\nV (\u03b2s )\n\u00d1 = (\n(23)\n\u2212 ) ln\n3\u03b3\n2\nV (\u03b2cr )\nFor a power law potential ( 23 ) readily reduces to the expression obtained by Liddle and Majumdar [ 6 ].\nIV. NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS\n\nWe will show that a simple and elegant analytical formula for the number of e-folding can be obtained in case of\nthe logarithmic potential ( 13 ). As mentioned earlier that \u03b3 \u2243 1/ ln(\u03b2) in the present case [ 4,5 ].Substituting the\napproximate value of \u03b3 in ( 22 ) leads to a simple expression for \u00d1 (\u03b2),\n\u00d1 (\u03b2) =\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n3\u03b2\n2\u03b2 ln \u03b2\n\nUsing ( 21 ) we obtain the formula for the total number of e-foldings ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b2s\nln \u03b2s\n1\n\u2212 ln\n\u00d1 = ln\n3 \u03b2cr\n2\nln \u03b2cr\n5\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\n\fIt should be mentioned that we have used the approximate value of \u03b3 to obtain the above expression for \u00d1 .Since\nthe approximation holds good away from the core and little contribution to the number of e-foldings comes from the\nregions near the core, we would expect that the expression ( 25 ) gives the correct value of \u00d1 .We have evolved the field\nequations numerically and studied the evolution of the number of e-foldings. Fig2 displays the numerical evolution\nof \u00d1 for two different values of \u03c6c .The dependence of \u03b2s on \u03c6c can in general be red off from ( 17 ).The heights of\nmaxima of \u00d1 are described by ( 25 ).We see the remarkable agreement of our analytical result with the numerical\nsimulation.As emphasized earlier [ 4, 5 ] the number of e-foldings \u00d1 is small.Even if \u03c6c is pushed to electro-weak\nscale \u00d1 does not exceed 10.One might think that brane world inflation would be helpful here as the brane corrections\nenhances the prospects of inflation [ 8, 9, 10]. Unfortunately , this is not so as the brane induced term increases the\nHubble expansion rate which is not relevant during oscillations.\n2.5\n\u03c6c=10-7\n\n2\n\n\u03c6c=10-6\n\n~\n\nN\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\u03b7\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\nFIG. 3. Plot of \u00d1 versus \u03b7 \u2261 tM based upon numerical simulation for two choices of \u03c6c .The evolution takes place from the\nend of slow roll and counts the number of e-foldings during the oscillations.The heights of maxima give the actual number of\ne-foldings described by ( 25 ).\n\nWe have described the general features of oscillatory inflation.We have been able to obtain a general expression for\nthe number of e-foldings and demonstrated its consistency. Applying the same to the logarithmic potential we obtained\nan elegant and simple analytical formula for the number of e-foldings.We evolve the field equations numerically and\nobserve a remarkable agreement of the analytical result with the numerical simulation.\nV.
