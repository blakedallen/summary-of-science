Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15260\nUnited States of America\n\nThe status of some of the recently discovered heavy hadrons is presented.\n\n1. Introduction\nMore than 30 years after the November Revolution, charmonium spectroscopy continues to surprise and challenge. A new era began in April of 2003 when BaBar\nannounced the discovery of the enigmatic Ds (2317). This state continues to perplex\nus and Fermilab, CLEO, BES, BaBar, and Belle continue to add grist to the mill.\nThis conference report is a brief review of the new heavy hadron spectroscopy.\n\n2. The New States\n2.1. Bc\nCDF recently announced the discovery of the Bc meson. The timing was arranged\nwith the FNAL lattice group to permit them a prediction of its mass. The respective\nresults are 6287(5)(1) MeV1 and 6304(4) MeV2 . Thus CDF may claim a state, the\nlattice may claim a victory, and the Bc appears to carry no surprises. Historians\nmay be interested to know, however, that Godfrey and Isgur3 predicted this mass\nwith the same accuracy as the lattice, but with a twenty year lead time.\n\n2.2. hc\nThe hc has been observed by CLEO4 with a mass of 3524(1) MeV. This may be\ncompared with typical quark model expectations5 of 3518 MeV, leading one to\nsuspect that the hc is also not hiding anything from us. Nevertheless, it tells us\nsomething: the hc lies within 2 MeV of the spin-averaged mass of the \u03c7cJ multiplet:\nMc.o.g. = 91 (\u03c70 + 5\u03c71 + 9\u03c72 ) = 3525.36. Since the splittings between these states\nare driven by the O(v/c) quark interactions, we are learning something about the\nDirac structure of confinement (namely that it is an effective scalar).\n1\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018 21:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nHH\n\nSwanson\n\n2.3. \u03b7c\u2032\nThe CLEO collaboration6 has observed the \u03b7c\u2032 with a mass of 3638(4) MeV and\na width of 19(10) MeV. This is to be compared with the old result of Crystal\nBall7 of 3592(5) MeV. The \u03b7c\u2032 is of some interest because its splitting with the \u03c8 \u2032 is\ndriven by the hyperfine interaction and hence probes this interaction in a new region.\nSpecifically, the ground state vector-pseudoscalar splitting is m(J/\u03c8)\u2212 m(\u03b7c ) = 117\nMeV whereas the excited splitting is now measured to be m(\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2212 m(\u03b7c\u2032 ) = 48 MeV.\nTheoretical expectations for the former range from 108 to 123 MeV in simple\n(or 'relativised') quark models5 and thus are within expectations. Alternatively,\nthe latter is predicted to be 67 MeV in the quark model of Eichten, Lane, and\nQuigg8. However, the authors note that including unquenching effects due to open\ncharm meson loops lowers this splitting to 46 MeV which is taken as evidence\nin favour of their 'unquenched' quark model. However, the simple quark models\nmentioned above5 find splittings of 42 - 53 MeV, indicating that it is too early to\nmake definitive conclusions about loop effects. It is worth noting, furthermore, that\nattempts to unquench the quark model are fraught with technical difficulty9 and\na great deal of effort is required before we can be confident in the results of any\nmodel.\n2.4. Ds (2317) and Ds (2460)\nThese states are roughly 100 MeV below quark model expectations and point to\neither exotic structure, such as DK molecules11, or to a deep misunderstanding of\nheavy-light hadrons. For example, the DK and D\u2217 K continua are both nearby and\ncouple to Ds0 and Ds1 in S-wave. Is it possible that we have underestimated the\nimportance of coupled channel effects in some systems?\n2.5. Ds (2632)\nThe Ds (2632) was discovered by the SELEX collaboration at FNAL12 in the final\nstates D0 K + and Ds \u03b7. The measured mass is 2632.6(1.6) MeV and the state is\nsurprisingly narrow with a width of less than 17 MeV at the 90% confidence level.\nThe ratio of the partial widths is measured to be\n\u0393(Ds \u2192 D0 K + )\n= 0.16 \u00b1 0.06.\n\u0393(Ds \u2192 Ds \u03b7)\n\n(1)\n\nAs pointed out by the SELEX collaboration, this is an unusual result since the DK\nmode is favoured by phase space.\nIt is unlikely that this state is a cs\u0304 hybrid since the mass of such a state is\nexpected to be roughly 3170 MeV. Possible molecular states include a Ds\u2217 \u03b7 system\nat 2660 MeV or Ds\u2217 \u03c9 or D\u2217 K \u2217 states at 2900 MeV. However the former is a P-wave\nwhich is not favoured for binding, while the latter are too heavy to be plausible.\nThe remaining possibility is that the Ds (2632) is a radially excited cs\u0304 vector13\n(although it is some 100 MeV lighter than quark model predictions of 2730 MeV).\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018 21:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nHH\n\nReview of Heavy Hadron Spectroscopy\n\n3\n\nThe peculiar decay ratio remains to be explained. Experience with the decay modes\nof the \u03c8(3S) to DD, DD\u2217 and D\u2217 D\u2217 points to a possible resolution: transition\nmatrix elements for excited hadrons may have zeroes due to wavefunction nodes.\nIt is possible that such a node is suppressing the DK decay mode. Computation14\nreveals that there is indeed a node but that it occurs at a wavefunction scale which\nis 20% lower than preferred. Furthermore, the DK mode is always larger than the\nDs \u03b7 mode.\nWe have run out of options and must conclude that the Ds (2632) is an experimental artefact. This conclusion now appears likely because searches by FOCUS15 ,\nBaBar16, and CLEO17 have found no evidence for the state.\n2.6. X(3872)\nThe X(3872) is the poster boy of the new heavy hadrons \u2013 it has been confirmed by\nfour experiments18 at a mass of 3872 MeV and is very narrow, \u0393 < 2.3 MeV at 95%.\nThe anomalous nature of the X has led to much speculation: tetraquark19, cusp20 ,\nhybrid21 , or glueball22 . But the most popular explanation is that it is a DD\u0304\u2217 bound\nstate23,24 . This model has successfully predicted24 the quantum numbers of the X\n(J P C = 1++ 25 ), the decay mode \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 26 , that the \u03c0\u03c0 and 3\u03c0 modes should be\ncomparable27, and that the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass distribution should be dominated by\nthe \u03c128 while the 3\u03c0 invariant mass distribution should be dominated by the \u03c9 26 .\nThis string of successes has met with recent experimental challenges: (i) The X\nhas been observed decaying to \u03b3J/\u03c8 26 with a strength Br(X \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8)/Br(X \u2192\n\u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8) = 0.14(5)29. This rate is substantially larger than predicted in the model\nof Ref. 24 . (ii) There are rumours that Belle have seen the mode X \u2192 DD\u0304\u03c0 and\nthat its rate is ten times larger than that of \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 30 . The model predicts this ratio\nto be 1/20. (iii) BaBar report31\nBr(B 0 \u2192 XK 0 )\n= 0.61(36)(6).\nBr(B + \u2192 XK + )\n\n(2)\n\nThis is at odds with the molecular picture which predicts a ratio of O( N12 ) +\nc\nZ\nO( D+ D\u2212 ) \u2248 10%. (iv) Belle25 and BaBar31 have measured the product of branchZD0 D\u03040\u2217\n\ning ratios:\nBr(B + \u2192 XK + )Br(X \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8) = 1.3(3)[0.85(30)] * 10\u22125 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe new DD\u0304\u03c0 data imply that Br(B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8) < 0.1 which implies that Br(B \u2192\nXK) > 10\u22124 . This is comparable to the rate Br(B \u2192 \u03c7c1 K) and points to a large\ncc\u0304 component in the X.\nAll of these new data may be accounted for if the predicted hidden charm interactions of Ref.24 were over-estimated. This leads to weaker binding which gives\nrise to a much narrower X with a dominant DD\u0304\u03c0 mode, weak \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 and \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8\nmodes, and a radiative transition of the desired magnitude.\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018 21:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nHH\n\nSwanson\n\n2.7. X(3940)\nThe X(3940) is seen by Belle32 recoiling against J/\u03c8 in e+ e\u2212 collisions. The state\nhas a mass of 3943(11)(13) MeV and a width of 87(22)(26) MeV33 . The X is seen to\ndecay to DD\u0304\u2217 and not to \u03c9J/\u03c8 or DD\u0304. It is natural to attempt a 2P cc\u0304 assignment\nfor this state since the expected mass of the 23 PJ multiplet is 3920 - 3980 MeV\nand the expected widths are 30 - 165 MeV5 . Finally, if the DD\u0304\u2217 mode is dominant\nit suggests that the X(3940) is the \u03c7\u2032c1 . The problem with this assignment is that\nthere is no evidence for the \u03c7c1 in the same data. This has led Olsen to speculate34\nthat the X is the \u03b7c\u2032\u2032 . Unfortunately this interpretation is also suspect because the\n\u03b7c\u2032\u2032 has an expected mass of 4064 MeV, 120 MeV too high.\n2.8. Y (3940)\nThe Y (3940) is claimed as a resonance in the \u03c9J/\u03c8 subsystem of the decay B \u2192\nK\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 35 with a mass of 3940(11) MeV and a width of 92(24) MeV. The state\nhas not been seen in the decay modes Y \u2192 DD\u0304 or DD\u0304\u2217 . Again, the mass and width\nof the Y suggest a radially excited P-wave charmonium. However, the \u03c9J/\u03c8 decay\nmode is peculiar. In more detail, Belle measure Br(B \u2192 KY )Br(Y \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8) =\n5.0(9)(16)*10\u22125. One expects that Br(B \u2192 K\u03c7\u2032cJ ) < Br(B \u2192 K\u03c7cJ ) = 4(1)*10\u22124 .\nThis implies Br(Y \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8) > 12%, which is unusual for a canonical cc\u0304 state above\nopen charm threshold.\nThus the Y is something of an enigma, driving the claim of the Belle collaboration that it is a hybrid. This is perhaps premature \u2013 certainly more data are\nrequired before strong claims can be made.\n2.9. Z(3930)\nThis state was observed by the Belle collaboration10 in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 DD\u0304 with a mass\nof 3931(4) MeV and a width of 20(8)(3) and a claimed significance of 5.5 sigma.\nThe DD\u0304 helicity distribution is consistent with J=2. In line with the X and the Y ,\nthe Z seems an obvious candidate for the \u03c7\u2032c2 (the \u03c7\u2032c1 cannot decay to DD\u0304). The\npredicted mass of the \u03c7c2 is 3972 MeV and the predicted width is 80 MeV5 . However,\nsetting the mass to the measured 3931 MeV restricts phase space sufficiently that\nthe predicted strong width drops to 47 MeV, reasonably close to the measurement.\nThe predicted branching fraction to DD\u0304 is 70%. The largest radiative transition\nis \u03c7\u2032c2 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03b3 with a rate of 180(30) keV. At this stage we have no reason not to\nbelieve that the Z is the previously unknown \u03c7\u2032c2 .\n2.10. Y (4260)\nThe Y (4260) was discovered as an enhancement in the \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 subsystem of the\nreaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3ISR \u03c8\u03c0\u03c0 with a mass of 4259(8)(4) MeV and a width of 88(23)(5)\nMeV by the BaBar collaboration36. Evidentally the state is a vector with cc\u0304 flavour.\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018 21:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nHH\n\nReview of Heavy Hadron Spectroscopy\n\n5\n\nOf course the low lying charmonium vectors are well known and the only mesonic\ncharmonium vector available is the \u03c8(3D). However quark model estimates of its\nmass place it at 4460 MeV, much too heavy for the Y . Of course this statement\nrelies on the quark model itself \u2013 Llanes-Estrada37 has argued that the Y is the\n\u03c8(4S) based on the spectrum of a relativistic model. Maiani al.38 claim the Y is a\ntetraquark cc\u0304ss\u0304 state which decays predominantly to Ds D\u0304s . Of the states which we\nknow must exist, the most natural explanation is as a cc\u0304 hybrid39 . The lightest charmonium hybrid is expected at 4400 MeV, somewhat high, but perhaps acceptable\ngiven our lack of experience in this sector.\nLastly, it is tempting to examine molecular interpretations of this state. In particular DD1 is an S-wave threshold at 4290 MeV \u2013 close enough that the enhancement\nmay simply be a cusp effect. If the system does bind, it does so with a novel mechanism since pion exchange does not lead to a diagonal interaction in this channel\n(unlike the case of the X(3872)). Off-diagonal interactions may provide the required\nnovelty.\n3. Conclusions\nThe new heavy meson spectroscopy is no mere butterfly collecting \u2013 the Ds spectrum\nand the Xs, Y s, and Zs challenge our understanding of QCD. Can we rise to the\nchallenge? It is clear that the simple constituent quark model must fail somewhere\n(gluonic degrees of freedom turn on, relativity and chirality become important, and\ncoupled channels become dense) \u2013 are we seeing this? Lastly, have we entered a new\nera of 'mesonic nuclear physics' ?\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by PPARC grant PP/B500607 and the US Department\nof Energy under contract DE-FG02-00ER41135.
