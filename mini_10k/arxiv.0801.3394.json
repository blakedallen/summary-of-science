A k-subset R of G is called an (m, n, k, \u03bb) relative difference\nset (RDS) in G relative to N if every element g \u2208 G\\N has exactly \u03bb representations g = r1 r2\u22121 with r1 , r2 \u2208 R, and no non-identity element of N has such\na representation. The subgroup N is usually called the forbidden subgroup. If\nthe group G is abelian (resp. non-abelian), then D is called an abelian (resp.\nnon-abelian) relative difference set. When n = 1, R is an (m, k, \u03bb) difference\nset in the usual sense. If k = n\u03bb, then R is said to be semi-regular.\nFor a subset X of G, we set X (\u22121) = {x\u22121 | x \u2208 X}; also we use the same X to\nP\ndenote the group ring element x\u2208X x \u2208 Z[G]. Then, a k-subset R of G is an\n(m, n, k, \u03bb) relative difference set in G relative to N if and only if it satisfies\nthe following equation in the group ring Z[G]:\nRR(\u22121) = k + \u03bb(G \u2212 N).\nCharacter theory is a very useful tool in the study of difference sets and relative\ndifference sets in abelian groups. We state the Fourier inversion formula below,\nwhich will be used many times in the paper.\nInversion formula Let G be an abelian group of order v. If A = g\u2208G ag g \u2208\nP\nZ[G], then ah = v1 \u03c7\u2208\u011c \u03c7(Ah\u22121 ), for all h \u2208 G, where \u011c is the group of\nP\ncharacters of G and \u03c7(Ah\u22121 ) = g\u2208G ag \u03c7(gh\u22121 ).\nP\n\nOne consequence of the inversion formula is as follows. Let G be an abelian\ngroup of finite order, and let A and B be two elements of Z[G]. Then we have\nA = B if and only if \u03c7(A) = \u03c7(B) for all characters \u03c7 of G. The following\nresult is a standard characterization of relative difference sets by using their\ncharacter values (c.f. [3, p. 374]).\n\nProposition 1.1 Let G be an abelian group of order mn with a subgroup N\nof order n. Let k and \u03bb be positive integers satisfying k(k \u2212 1) = \u03bbn(m \u2212 1).\nThen a k-subset D of G is an (m, n, k, \u03bb) difference set in G relative to N if\nand only if for every non-principal character \u03c7 of G,\n\u03c7(D)\u03c7(D) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 k,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3k\n\nif \u03c7|N 6= 1 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u2212 \u03bbn, if \u03c7|N = 1 .\n\nwhere \u03c7|N is the restriction of \u03c7 to N.\nRecently a connection between semi-regular abelian RDS and mutually unbiased bases is established in [7]. To explain the connection, we first give the\n2\n\n\fdefinition of mutually unbiased bases. Let C be the field of complex numbers.\nA pair of bases x1 , x2 , . . . , xd and y1 , y2 , . . . , yd of Cd is said to be mutually\nunbiased if they are both orthonormal and there is a constant a such that\n|hxi , yj i| = a,\nfor all i and j, i 6= j, where h*, *i is the standard inner product of Cd . Let\nNMUB (d) denote the maximum size of any set containing pairwise mutually\nunbiased bases (MUB) of Cd . It is an open question to determine NMUB (d)\nfor every d. There are some similarities between NMUB (d) and NMOLS (d), the\nmaximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of size d. For example,\nit is known [5] that NMUB (d) \u2264 d + 1; and when d = pe is a prime power it\nwas shown [9], [19] that NMUB (pe ) = pe + 1. Also if d = st, then we have\nNMUB (d) \u2265 min{NMUB (s), NMUB (t)}.\n\n(1.2)\n\nFor an arbitrary positive integer d and a prime p, we use \u03bdp (d) to denote p\u03b1 ,\nwhere p\u03b1 |d but p\u03b1+1 \u2224 d. We also use \u03c0(d) to denote the set of prime divisors\nof d. Then by (1.2), we have\nNMUB (d) \u2265 minp\u2208\u03c0(d) {NMUB (\u03bdp (d))} = minp\u2208\u03c0(d) {\u03bdp (d) + 1}.\n\n(1.3)\n\nWe will refer to this construction as the reduce to prime power construction.\nFor more information on NMUB (d), we refer the reader to [1] and [7].\nWe now state a theorem in [7] which establishes a connection between semiregular abelian RDS and mutually unbiased bases.\nTheorem 1.2 ([7]) The existence of a semi-regular (m, n, m, m/n) RDS in\nan abelian group implies the existence of a set of n + 1 mutually unbiased\nbases of Cm .\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 is a straightforward application of Proposition1.1.\nWe refer the reader to [7] for the proof and other background materials on\nmutually unbiased bases. Motivated by the desire to use Theorem 1.2 to construct more MUB than the minimum in (1.3) given by the reduce to prime\npower construction, Wocjan [18] asked the following question: Does there exist\nan abelian semi-regular relative difference set with parameters (m, n, m, m/n)\nsatisfying\nn > minp\u2208\u03c0(m) {\u03bdp (m)}?\n(1.4)\nWe make some preliminary observations regarding this question. First of all,\nmost known semi-regular RDS have parameters (pa , pb , pa , pa\u2212b ), where p is a\nprime. The parameters of these RDS will not satisfy (1.4). The reason is quite\nstraightforward. Note that if m is a prime power, then (1.4) simply becomes\nn > m. For RDS with parameters (pa , pb , pa , pa\u2212b ), where p is a prime, we\n3\n\n\fhave pa\u2212b \u2265 1; hence n = pb \u2264 pa = m. Therefore to answer the question\nof Wocjan we have to consider semi-regular (m, n, m, m/n) RDS with m not\na prime power. As far as we know, there are only two general constructions\n([12], [4]) of such semi-regular RDS with n > 2. The RDS constructed in these\npapers have parameters\n(p2t (p + 1), p + 1, p2t (p + 1), p2t ),\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere t is a positive integer, and p = 2 or p is a Mersenne prime. Note\nthat the parameters in (1.5) do not satisfy (1.4) either since n = p + 1 and\nminr\u2208\u03c0(m) {\u03bdr (m)} = p + 1 (here p = 2 or p is a Mersenne prime).\nTherefore we are motivated to search for semi-regular RDS with parameters\n(m, n, m, m/n) not of the form (1.5) and m not a prime power. The simplest\ncase to consider is when (m, n, m, m/n) = (2p, p, 2p, 2), p an odd prime. We\nprove in Section 3 that there does not exist a (2p, p, 2p, 2) RDS in any group of\norder 2p2 . Next we prove that an abelian (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS with p an odd prime\ncan only exist in the group Z22 \u00d7 Z23 . On the construction side, we construct a\nfamily of (4q, q, 4q, 4) non-abelian RDS, where q is an odd prime power greater\nthan 9, q \u2261 1 (mod 4). When q = p is a prime (also p > 9 and p \u2261 1 (mod 4)),\nby the above nonexistence result on abelian (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS, we see that the\nRDS we construct here are genuinely nonabelian in the sense that there does\nnot exist an abelian RDS with the same parameters.\nWe give some preparation results in the rest of this section. For any group\nG with a subgroup N, we use CG (N) to denote the centralizer of N in G,\nnamely, CG (N) = {x \u2208 G : xy = yx, \u2200y \u2208 N}. Also we use exp(G) to denote\nthe exponent of G. The following lemma on RDS is implicitly contained in [6],\nand has its origin in [15].\nLemma 1.3 Let G be a group of order mn with an abelian normal subgroup\nN of order n, and let R be an (m, n, m, m/n) RDS in G relative to N. Then\nexp(CG (N)) divides 2m. Furthermore if the Sylow 2-subgroup of N is not cyclic\nor m/n is even, then exp(CG (N)) divides m.\nPROOF. Since N is abelian, we have CG (N) \u2265 N. If CG (N) = N, then\nof course |CG (N)| = |N|. Hence exp(CG (N)) divides |N| = n, which in turn\ndivides m since m/n is an integer. So we will assume that CG (N) 6= N from\nnow on. Given an element g \u2208 G, we use \u1e21 to denote its image in G/N.\nAlso we use r\u1e21 to denote the unique element in R \u2229 gN. Now for any given\ng \u2208 CG (N) \\ N, we set\nS = {(rgh , rh\u0304 ) : h\u0304 \u2208 G/N}.\nWe have |S| = m. Since N is normal in G, we see that for any pair (r1 , r2 ) \u2208 S,\nr1 r2\u22121 \u2208 gN. Next we claim that each gu, where u \u2208 N, can be represented\n4\n\n\fas gu = r1 r2\u22121 , for m/n pairs (r1 , r2 ) \u2208 S. This claim can be seen as follows.\nSince R is an (m, n, m, m/n) RDS in G relative to N, each gu, u \u2208 N, can be\nrepresented as gu = xy \u22121 , for m/n pairs (x, y) \u2208 R \u00d7 R. Let y = hu\u2032 , where\nu\u2032 \u2208 N. Then x = guhu\u2032 = gh(h\u22121 uh)u\u2032. Since N is normal in G, we have\nh\u22121 uh \u2208 N. Hence x \u2208 R \u2229 ghN. The claim is proved. It follows that,\ngm(\n\nY\n\nu)m/n =\n\nu\u2208N\n\nY\n\n(gu)m/n =\n\nu\u2208N\n\nY\n\nr1 r2\u22121 .\n\n(r1 ,r2 )\u2208S\n\nNow using the assumption that g \u2208 CG (N), we can arrange the terms in the\nlast product above in such a way that r1 r2\u22121 is followed by r2 r3\u22121 , and so on.\nTherefore we have\nY\ngm(\nu)m/n = 1.\nu\u2208N\n\nThe element a := u\u2208N u has order at most 2. So g 2m = 1. Hence exp(CG (N))\ndivides 2m. If the Sylow 2-subgroup of N is not cyclic, then N has at least two\nelements of order 2; hence a = 1. Therefore we have g m = 1 and exp(CG (N))\ndivides m. If m/n is even, then clearly we have g m = 1 and exp(CG (N))|m.\nThe proof is complete.\n\u2737\nQ\n\nLet p be a prime and f : Znp \u2192 Zp be a function. The Fourier transform f\u02c6 of\nf is defined by\nX\nf\u02c6(b) =\n\u03bepf (x)+b*x , \u2200b \u2208 Znp ,\nx\u2208Zn\np\n\nwhere b * x is the standard dot product and \u03bep is a primitive pth root of unity\nin C. The function f is said to be p-ary bent if |f\u02c6(b)| = pn/2 for all b \u2208 Znp .\nIn Section 4, we will need the following theorem from [10].\nTheorem 1.4 ([10]) Let p be an odd prime. Then a function f : Zp \u2192 Zp is\np-ary bent if and only if deg(f ) = 2.\nThroughout this paper, we fix the following notation: For a multiplicative\ngroup G, we denote its identity by 1G , or simply by 1 if there is no confusion.\nFor a positive integer\n\u0010 \u0011 m, \u03bem denotes a primitive mth root of unity in C.

Therefore it suffices\nto show that the first three equations hold in Z[H]. We will do so by proving\nthat the left hand side and the right hand side of each of the first three\nequations have the same character values for all characters of H. This can be\nchecked easily for the principal character of H. Now let \u03c7u,v be an arbitrary\nnon-principal character of H. For simplicity write \u03c7 = \u03c7u,v , \u03c71 = \u03c7eu,f v ,\n\u03c72 = \u03c7e2 u,f 2 v . Let\n(a, b, c, d) = (\u03c7(R0 ), \u03c7(R1 ), \u03c7(R2 ), \u03c7(R3 )),\n(a , b\u2032 , c\u2032 , d\u2032 ) = (\u03c71 (R0 ), \u03c71 (R1 ), \u03c71 (R2 ), \u03c71 (R3 )),\n(a\u2032\u2032 , b\u2032\u2032 , c\u2032\u2032 , d\u2032\u2032 ) = (\u03c72 (R0 ), \u03c72 (R1 ), \u03c72 (R2 ), \u03c72 (R3 )).\n\u2032\n\nBy Fact 3, in order to prove the theorem, it suffices to show that\na\u0101 + bb\u0304 + cc\u0304 + dd \u0304 = 4q \u2212 4\u03c7(N),\nab\u2032 + bc\u2032 + cd\u2032 + da\u2032 = 0,\nac\u2032\u2032 + ca\u2032\u2032 + bd\u2032\u2032 + db\u2032\u2032 = 0.\n\n8\n\n\fIf v = 0, then \u03c7 is principal on N. Hence \u03c7(N) = q, and a = b = c = d = 0.\nWe see that all three equations above hold in this case.\nIf v 6= 0, then \u03c7 is non-principal on N. Hence \u03c7(N) = 0. Using Fact 1, we see\nthat\na\u0101 = bb\u0304 = cc\u0304 = dd \u0304 = SS = q.\nTherefore we have a\u0101 + bb\u0304 + cc\u0304 + dd \u0304 = 4q \u2212 4\u03c7(N) in this case.

When q = p is a prime, p \u2261 1 (mod 4), p > 9, we have constructed\na (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS in groups G\u203213 (e = \u2212f ), G14 (e = 1), G15 (e = \u22121), G16\n(e = f ) as listed in [8].\n\n3\n\nNon-existence of (2p, p, 2p, 2) RDS in groups of order 2p2\n\nThroughout this section p is an odd prime. We will show that there does not\nexist a (2p, p, 2p, 2) RDS in any group of order 2p2 .\nLet G be a group of order 2p2 . Then G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup H\nof order p2 . (This is an easy consequence of Sylow's theorems.) Hence H is a\nnormal subgroup of G.\nWe first consider the case where H is cyclic. In this case, H has a unique\nsubgroup N of order p. Hence N is a normal subgroup of G. Also CG (N) \u2265 H.\nIf R is a (2p, p, 2p, 2) RDS in G relative to N, then by Lemma 1.3, we have\np2 |2p, which is impossible. So from now on, we assume that H is not cyclic,\nsay H = ha, b : ap = bp = 1, [a, b] = 1i.\nLet c \u2208 G be an element of order 2. Then G is a semidirect product of H and\n{1, c}. Since Aut(H) \u223c\n= GL2 (Fp ), and every element of order 2 in GL2 (Fp )\nis conjugate to a diagonal matrix with \u00b11's on the diagonal, there are three\nisomorphism types of semidirect product of H and {1, c}. Below we list the\nthree nonisomorphic groups of order 2p2 with noncyclic Sylow p-subgroup H:\nG1 =ha, b, c : ap = bp = c2 = 1, [a, b] = 1, ac = a\u22121 , bc = b\u22121 i;\nG2 =ha, b, c : ap = bp = c2 = 1, [a, b] = 1, ac = a\u22121 , [b, c] = 1i;\nG3 =ha, b, c : ap = bp = c2 = 1, [a, b] = [a, c] = [b, c] = 1i.\n\nIn each Gi , i = 1, 2, 3, we consider the orbits of subgroups of order p under\nthe action of the full automorphism group Aut(Gi ). There is only one orbit\nof subgroups order p in G1 and G3 , and there are three such orbits in G2 .

We then have \u03bb2 + (4 \u2212 p)\u03bb + 2 = 0.\nHence \u03bb = 1 or 2, and p = 7.\nIf \u03bb = 1, then S is a (7, 3, 1) difference set in Z7 . Since 2 is a multiplier of S\n(see [3, p. 323]), we have S = {t + s,\u00102t + s, 4t +\u0011s} for some integers s, t, where\nP\nP6\nt+s\ni\ni\n1 \u2264 t \u2264 6.

Then there does not exist a (2p, p, 2p, 2)\nRDS in any group of order 2p2 .\n\nPROOF. By the analysis preceding Lemma 3.1, we only need to consider\nthe five cases listed before Lemma 3.1. We use the same notation as in the\ndiscussion at the beginning of this section. Suppose R is a putative (2p, p, 2p, 2)\nRDS in G relative to N. Write R = R1 +R2 c, where Ri \u2208 Z[H], H = hai\u00d7hbi \u223c\n=\nZp \u00d7 Zp . Then RR(\u22121) = 2p + 2(G \u2212 N). Hence we have\n(\u22121)\n\nR1 R1\n\n(\u22121)\n\n+ R2 R2\n\n= 2p + 2(H \u2212 N),\n\n(\u2212c)\n\nR1 R2\n\n(\u2212c)\n\n+ R2 R1\n\n= 2H.\n\nApplying the principal character of H to the above equations, we find that\n|R1 | = |R2 | = p.\n12\n\n\fWe now consider the five cases one by one.\n(\u2212c)\n\nCase 1. G = G1 and N = hai. In this case we have R1 R2 = R1 R2 . Hence\n(\u22121)\n(\u22121)\nR1 R1 + R2 R2 = 2p + 2(H \u2212 N) and R1 R2 = H. For any \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 whose\nrestriction on N is non-principal, we have\n\u03c7(R1 )\u03c7(R2 ) = 0,\n\u03c7(R1 )\u03c7(R1 ) + \u03c7(R2 )\u03c7(R2 ) = 2p.\nHence |\u03c7(R1 )|2 = 2p or 0. Let S1 = {\u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 : \u03c7 is non-principal on N and\n(\u22121)\n|\u03c7(R1 )|2 = 2p}. It is clear that the coefficient of 1H in R1 R1 is |R1 | = p. This\ncoefficient can also be calculated by using the inversion formula. We therefore\nhave\n1\n1 X\n(\u22121)\n\u03c7(R1 R1 ) = 2 (p2 + 2p|S1 |).\np= 2\np \u03c7\u2208\u0124\np\nIt follows that |S1 | = p(p\u22121)\n. Now note that Gal(Q(\u03bep )/Q) acts on \u0124, and\n2\nS1 is fixed (setwise) under this action. Therefore S1 is partitioned into orbits\nunder the aforementioned action, each having size p \u2212 1. So |S1 | \u2261 0 (mod\n. We have reached the desired\np \u2212 1). But this is impossible since |S1 | = p(p\u22121)\n2\ncontradiction.\nCase 2. G = G3 and N = hai. In this case, the group G is abelian. For any\n\u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 whose restriction to N is non-principal, we have |\u03c7(R1 \u00b1 R2 )|2 = 2p.\nFrom the proof of Lemma 3.1, we have \u03c7(R1 + R2 ) = f1 \u2206 and \u03c7(R1 \u2212 R2 ) =\nf2 \u2206, where fi \u2208 Z[\u03bep ] and |fi |2 = 2, for i = 1, 2. Since (f1 \u2212 f2 )\u2206 = 2\u03c7(R2 ),\nwe have 2|(f1 \u2212 f2 ) in Z[\u03bep ]. Let f2 = f1 + 2x for some x \u2208 Z[\u03bep ]. Multiplying\nboth sides of this equation by f \u03041 , we have\nf \u03041 f2 = f \u03041 f1 + 2xf \u03041 = 2 + 2xf \u03041 .\nSo 2|f \u03041 f2 . Let f \u03041 f2 = 2y for some y \u2208 Z[\u03bep ]. Multiplying both sides of the\nequation\nby f1 , we obtain f2 = f1 y. Since both f1 and f2 have modulus\n\u221a\n2, we have f1 = \u03b7f2 for some root of unity \u03b7 \u2208 Z[\u03bep ]. Now 2\u03c7(R1 ) =\n(f1 + f2 )\u2206 = f2 (1 + \u03b7)\u2206. Multiplying this equation by its own complex conjugate, we find that 2|(1 + \u03b7)(1 + \u03b7). Recall that \u03b7 is a root of unity in Z[\u03bep ]\nand gcd((2), (1 \u2212 \u03bep )) = 1, we see that \u03b7 = \u00b11. It follows that |\u03c7(R1 )|2 = 0 or\n2p. Now the same arguments as those in the first case yield a contradiction.\nCase 3: G = G2 and N = hai. For any (u, v) \u2208 Z2p , we denote by \u03c7u,v the char\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nacter of H defined by \u03c7u,v (au bv ) = \u03bepuu +vv . Then \u03c7u,v ((ai bj )c ) = \u03c7\u2212u,v (ai bj ).\n(\u2212c)\nSo \u03c7u,v (Ri ) = \u03c7u,\u2212v (Ri ) for i = 1, 2. Let \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 and \u03c7|N 6= 1. If \u03c7 is princi(\u2212c)\n(\u2212c)\npal on hbi, then from R1 R2 +R2 R1 = 2H we deduce that \u03c7(R1 )\u03c7(R2 ) = 0.\n13\n\n\fWithout\n\u221a loss of generality we assume that \u03c7(R1 ) = 0. Then \u03c7(R2 ) has modulus 2p. Since R2 has size p, we have p = 7 by Lemma 3.1. Noting that the\ncharacters \u03c7u,0 with u \u2208 Z\u2217p form a single orbit of size (p \u2212 1) under the action\nof Gal(Q(\u03bep )/Q), we have \u03c7u,0 (R1 ) = 0 for all u \u2208 Z\u2217p .\n(\u22121)\n\n(\u22121)\n\n(c)\n\n(\u2212c)\n\n(c)\n\n(\u2212c)\n\nFrom R1 R1 + R2 R2 = 2p + 2(H \u2212 N), we have R1 R1 + R2 R2 =\n2p + 2(H \u2212 N). Now, apply a character \u03c7 which is non-principal on N to these\ngroup ring equations, we have\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\n|\u03c7(R1 )|2 + |\u03c7(R2 )|2 = 2p,\n(c)\n\n|\u03c7(R1 )|2 + |\u03c7(R2 )|2 = 2p,\n\n(c)\n\n(\u2212c)\n\n\u03c7(R1 )\u03c7(R2 ) + \u03c7(R2 )\u03c7(R1 ) = \u03c7(R1 )\u03c7(R2\n\n(\u2212c)\n\n) + \u03c7(R2 )\u03c7(R1\n\n) = 0.\n\nFrom the last equation, we have\n(\u2212c) 2\n\n|\u03c7(R1 )|2 |\u03c7(R2\n\n(\u2212c) 2\n\n| = |\u03c7(R2 )|2 |\u03c7(R1\n\n|.\n\n(\u2212c) 2\n\nSubstitute |\u03c7(R1 )|2 by 2p \u2212 |\u03c7(R2 )|2 , and |\u03c7(R1\nabove equation, we obtain\n(\u2212c)\n\n(2p \u2212 |\u03c7(R2 )|2 )|\u03c7(R2\n\n(\u2212c) 2\n\n| by 2p \u2212 |\u03c7(R2\n(\u2212c) 2\n\n)|2 = |\u03c7(R2 )|2 (2p \u2212 |\u03c7(R2\n\n(\u2212c)\n\nwhich simplifies to |\u03c7(R2 )|2 = |\u03c7(R2\n(\u2212c)\n|\u03c7(R1 )|2 . Hence\n\n| in the\n\n| ).\n\n)|2 . Similarly, we can show that |\u03c7(R1 )|2 =\n\n|\u03c7u,v (Ri )| = |\u03c7\u2212u,\u2212v (Ri )| = |\u03c7\u2212u,v (Ri )| = |\u03c7u,\u2212v (Ri )|.\nThus the characters of H that are principal on neither N nor hbi are partitioned\ninto subsets of size four of the form {\u03c7\u01eb1 u,\u01eb2v : \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 = \u00b11}, u, v \u2208 Z\u2217p , where\n(\u22121)\n|\u03c7\u01eb1 u,\u01eb2 v (Ri )| = |\u03c7u,v (Ri )|. Now computing the coefficient of 1H in R1 R1 by\nthe inversion formula, we have\np=\n\nX\n1 2 X\n1\n(p +\n|\u03c7u,0 (R1 )|2 +\n|\u03c70,v (R1 )|2 + 4x) = 2 (p2 + 4x)\n2\np\np\nu\u2208Z\u2217p\nv\u2208Z\u2217p\n\nfor some algebraic integer x . Hence 4|(p \u2212 1). But p = 7: we have reached a\ncontradiction.\nCase 4: G = G2 and N = hbi. Let \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 and \u03c7|N 6= 1. If \u03c7 is principal on\n(\u22121)\n(\u2212c)\nhai, then \u03c7(Ri ) = \u03c7(Ri ) for i = 1, 2. By the same arguments as those\nin Case 2, we have |\u03c7(R1 )|2 = 2p or 0. In the former case, since |R1 | = p, we\nhave p = 7 by Lemma 3.1. In the latter case, we have |\u03c7(R2 )|2 = 2p. Again\nsince |R2 | = p, we have p = 7 by Lemma 3.1. Now the same arguments as\nthose in the third case yield a contradiction.\n\n14\n\n\fCase 5: G = G2 and N = habi. Let \u03c71 be the character of H which maps a\nto 1 and b to \u03bep . Then \u03c71 is non-principal on N. Since \u03c71 |hai = 1, we have\n(\u22121)\n(\u2212c)\n\u03c71 (Ri ) = \u03c71 (Ri ). Using the same arguments as those in Case 2, we have\n|\u03c71 (R1 )|2 = 2p or |\u03c71 (R2 )|2 = 2p. Without loss of generality we assume that\n|\u03c71 (R1 )|2 = 2p. Since |R1 \u2229 ai N| = 1 for all i = 0, 1, . . . , (p \u2212 1), we can find a\nmap F1 : Zp \u2192 Zp such that\nR1 = {ax+F1 (x) bF1 (x) : x \u2208 Zp }.\nLet ai = |{x \u2208 Zp : F1 (x) = i}|. Then p\u22121\ni=0 ai = p, ai \u2265 0, and \u03c71 (R1 ) =\nPp\u22121\ni\n2\ni=0 ai \u03bep . Since |\u03c71 (R1 )| = 2p, by Lemma 3.1, we have p = 7, as = 4, a2i t+s =\n1, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2, and aj = 0 for the remaining j, where s, t are two integers, 0 \u2264\ns \u2264 6 and 1 \u2264 t \u2264 6. Assume that F1\u22121 (s) = {i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 }, F1\u22121 (t + s) = {i5 },\nF1\u22121 (2t + s) = {i6 }, F1\u22121 (4t + s) = {i7 }. Now let \u03c72 to be the character\n(\u22121)\nwhich maps a to \u03bep and b to 1. Then \u03c72 (Ri ) = \u03c72 (Ri ). Combining this\n(\u2212c)\n(\u2212c)\n= 2H, we deduce that \u03c72 (R1 )\u03c72 (R2 ) = 0. Hence\nwith R1 R2 + R2 R1\n|\u03c72 (R1 )|2 = 0 or 14. That is,\nP\n\n\u03c72 (R1 )\u03be7\u2212s = (\n\n4\nX\n\ni\n\n\u03be7j ) + \u03be7i5 +t + \u03be7i6 +2t + \u03be7i7 +4t\n\nj=1\n\n\u221a\nhas modulus 14 or 0. We assume that t is a non-square of Z7 . The case where\nt is a nonzero square in Z7 can be handled similarly.\nWe first consider the case where |\u03c72 (R1 )|2 = 14. Define\nS(x) := (\n\n4\nX\n\nj=1\n\nxij ) + xi5 +t + xi6 +2t + xi7 +4t \u2208 Z[x]/(x7 \u2212 1).\n\nThen S(x)S(x\u22121 ) = 14 + \u03bbT (x), where T (x) = 1 + x + x2 + * * * + x6 and \u03bb is a\nP\nnonnegative integer. It follows that \u03bb = 71 (72 \u221214) = 5. Write S(x) = 6i=0 ci xi .\nP\nSince the ij 's are distinct, we have 0 \u2264 ci \u2264 4, for all i. Also 6i=0 ci = 7 and\nP6\n2\ni=0 ci = 19. From these constrains, we find that there is only one possibility,\nnamely {c0 , c1 , . . . , c6 }={4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}. We may assume that ci1 = 4. It\nfollows that i1 = i5 + t = i6 + 2t = i7 + 4t. After replacing R1 by a\u2212i1 b\u2212s R1 if\nP\ni\nnecessary, we may assume that i1 = 0 and s = 0. In order for ( 4j=2 \u03be7j ) + 4 to\n\u221a\nhave modulus 14, we must have {i2 , i3 , i4 } = {1, 2, 4} or {3, 5, 6} by Lemma\n3.1. Since all ij 's are distinct and t is assumed to be a non-square modulo\n7, we see that {i2 , i3 , i4 } = {3, 5, 6}. So F1 maps all non-squares modulo 7\nto 0, and maps each square modulo 7 to its additive inverse. Let \u03c73 be the\ncharacter that maps a to \u03be7 and b to \u03be7u , and \u03c74 be the one that maps a to\n\u03be7 and b to \u03be7\u2212u , where u = 2 or 4. Then it is easy to see that |\u03c73 (R1 )|2 = 7,\n|\u03c74 (R1 )|2 = 0. But similar arguments to those in Case 3 show that we must\nhave |\u03c73 (R1 )| = |\u03c74 (R1 )|: a contradiction.\n15\n\n\fNext we consider the case where \u03c72 (R1 ) = 0. We have\n4\nX\n\ni\n\n\u03be7j + \u03be7i5 +t + \u03be7i6 +2t + \u03be7i7 +4t = 0.\n\nj=1\n\nHence {i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , i5 + t, i6 + 2t, i7 + 4t} = Z7 . It follows that {i5 , i6 , i7 } =\n{i5 +t, i6 +2t, i7 +4t}. Since t 6= 0, we have either (i5 , i6 , i7 ) = (i5 , i5 \u22122t, i5 +t)\nor (i5 , i6 , i7 ) = (i5 , i5 + t, i5 + 3t). By replacing R1 with a\u2212i5 b\u2212s R1 if necessary,\nwe may assume that s = 0 and i5 = 0. When (i5 , i6 , i7 ) = (0, \u22122t, t), apply the\ncharacter \u03c7\u20323 (resp. \u03c7\u20324 ) that maps a to \u03be7 and b to \u03be7u (resp. \u03be7\u2212u ) to R1 , where\nu = 3, we find that |\u03c7\u20323 (R1 )|2 = 7 and |\u03c7\u20324 (R1 )|2 = 0. But again we should\nhave |\u03c7\u20323 (R1 )| = |\u03c7\u20324 (R1 )| as before: a contradiction. The case (i5 , i6 , i7 ) =\n(0, t, 3t) is similarly ruled out: take u = 2 (in the definition of \u03c7\u20323 and \u03c7\u20324 );\nthen |\u03c7\u20323 (R1 )|2 = 14 and \u03c7\u20324 (R1 ) = 0, again contradicting |\u03c7\u20323 (R1 )| = |\u03c7\u20324 (R1 )|.\nThe proof of the theorem is now complete\n\n4\n\n\u2737\n\nNon-existence of (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS in abelian groups of order 4p2\n\nThroughout this section we let G be an abelian group of order 4p2 , p an odd\nprime. If G contains a (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS relative to a subgroup N of order\np, then by Lemma 1.3 the Sylow p-subgroup of G is non-cyclic. Therefore in\nthe rest of this section we always assume that the Sylow p-subgroup of G is\nisomorphic to Zp \u00d7 Zp .\nIn this section we will first show that if p 6= 3 is an odd prime, then G = Z22 \u00d7Z2p\ndoes not contain a (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS. We remark that G = Z22 \u00d7 Z23 indeed\ncontains a (12, 3, 12, 4) RDS, see [4] and [12].\nTheorem 4.1 Let p \u2265 5 be an odd prime. Then there does not exist a (4p, p, 4p, 4)\nrelative difference set in G = Z22 \u00d7 Z2p .\nPROOF. We write G = h\u03b11 : \u03b112 = 1i \u00d7 h\u03b12 : \u03b122 = 1i \u00d7 Z2p and H := Z2p < G.\nAssume that R is a (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS in G relative to a subgroup N of order\np. Since the subgroups of order p of G form a single orbit under the action of\nAut(G), we may choose N to be {0} \u00d7 Zp < H. By the definition of an RDS,\nwe have\nRR(\u22121) = 4p + 4(G \u2212 N) in Z[G].\n(4.1)\nOn one hand, if \u03b8 \u2208 \u011c and \u03b8|N = 1, then by applying \u03b8 to both sides of (4.1)\nwe obtain that \u03b8(R) = 0. On the other hand, if \u03b8 \u2208 \u011c and \u03b8|N 6= 1, then by\napplying \u03b8 to both sides of (4.1) we obtain that \u03b8(R)\u03b8(R) = 4p; by the same\n16\n\n\farguments as those at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 3.1, we find that\n\u03b8(R) = f0 (\u03bep )\u2206, where |f0 (\u03bep )|2 = 4 and f0 (x) \u2208 Z[x].

We consider two cases.\nCase 1. ordp (2) is odd. Let (2) = Q1 * * * Qg Q\u03041 * * * Q\u0304g be the prime ideal decomposition of (2) in Z[\u03bep ]. (Note that since ordp (2) is odd, the decomposition\ngroup of Ql does not contain the complex conjugation.) For each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4,\nlet\n(fi ) = Q1ri1 * * * Qrgig Q\u0304s1i1 * * * Q\u0304sgig ,\nwhere ril , sil \u2265 0. Then from fi f\u0304i = 4 we obtain that ril + sil = 2, \u2200l =\n1, 2, . . . g.\n\nWe claim that (fi ) = (fj ), \u2200 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 4. The proof of the claim goes as\nfollows. First note that by subtracting the two equations in (4.4) that involve\nfi and fj , we find that 2|(fi \u2212 fj ). Hence Ql |(fi \u2212 fj ) as well as Ql |(fi \u2212 fj )\n17\n\n\ffor each l. If ril = 0 for some l, then Ql does not divide fj since otherwise\nfrom fj \u2208 Ql and fi \u2212 fj \u2208 Ql we obtain fi \u2208 Ql , i.e. Ql |(fi ). So we must\nhave rjl = 0. Hence sil = sjl = 2. Similarly, if sil = 0 for some l, then sjl = 0\nand ril = rjl = 2. If ril = sil = 1 for some l, then neither rjl nor sjl can\nbe zero for otherwise ril = 0 or 2 from the above analysis. It follows that\nrjl = sjl = 1. We have thus proved that (fi ) and (fj ) has the same prime\nideal decomposition. Hence (fi ) = (fj ). It follows that fi = f1 \u03bci , where \u03bc1 = 1\nand \u03bci , 2 \u2264 i \u2264 4, are 2pth roots of unity. Furthermore, if fi 6= \u00b1fj for some\ni, j, then since (\u03bci \u2212 \u03bcj ) and (2) have no common prime ideal divisor, and\n2|(fi \u2212 fj ), we have (fi ) = (fj ) = (2). There are two possibilities to consider.\n(i) \u03bci = \u00b11, \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}. In this case, noting that \u03bc1 = 1, we see that\nP4\nP4\ni=1 \u03bci can only take one of the values 0, 4, \u00b12. If\ni=1 \u03bci = 0 or 4, then\n(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 , \u03bc4 ) must be one of\n(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, \u22121, 1, \u22121), (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121), (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1).\n\n\u221a\nIn each case, exactly one of a, b, c, d has modulus 4p and the others are 0. If\ni=1 \u03bci = \u00b12, then three of \u03bci , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are equal. We must have (f1 ) = (2)\nsince a is an algebraic integer. It follows that {a, b, c, d} = \u2206 * {\u03b7, \u03b7, \u03b7, \u2212\u03b7} for\nsome root of unity \u03b7.\n\nP4\n\n(ii) Some \u03bci is not equal to \u00b11. In this case, we have (fi ) = (2), \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4},\nby the analysis immediately preceding (i). So we write fi = 2\u03c9i with \u03c9i a\nroot of unity, for each i. It is clear that any subset of size p \u2212 1 of X :=\n{1, \u03bep , . . . , \u03bepp\u22121} forms an integral basis of Z[\u03bep ]. So any k-subset of X can be\ncompleted to an integral basis of Z[\u03bep ] when k < p \u2212 1. Write \u03c9i = \u01ebi \u03bepli with\nli \u2208 Zp and \u01ebi = \u00b11 for each i. Then at least two of the li 's are distinct, and\nthe distinct elements among the four \u03bepli 's can be completed to an integral\nbasis of Z[\u03bep ] as we remarked. We only consider\nthe case where P\nl1 6= l2 . The\nP\n4\n\n\u03c9\n\n4\n\n\u03c9\n\ni\ni\n\u2206, we see that i=1\nis an\nremaining cases are similar. From a = i=1\n2\n2\nalgebraic integer. Hence the sum of coefficients of \u03bepl1 (resp. \u03bepl2 ) is even in\nP4\ni=1 \u03c9i . Therefore we must have {l3 , l4 } = {l1 , l2 }, which in turn implies that\n{\u03c93 , \u03c94 } is one of \u00b1{\u03c91 , \u03c92}, \u00b1{\u03c91 , \u2212\u03c92 }. Case-by-case examinations show\nthat we must have either {a, b, c, d} = \u2206 * {\u03b71 , \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u2212\u03b72 } or {a, b, c, d} =\n\u2206*{\u03b71 +\u03b72 , \u03b71 \u2212\u03b72 , 0, 0}, where both \u03b71 and \u03b72 are roots of unity and \u03b71 6= \u00b1\u03b72 .\n\nTo summarize, we have the following\nthree possibilities for (a, b, c, d):\n\u221a\n(1A) exactly one has modulus 4p, and the others are 0;\n(2A) {a, b, c, d} = \u2206 * {\u03b71 , \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u2212\u03b72 };\n(2B) {a, b, c, d} = \u2206 * {\u03b71 + \u03b72 , \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 , 0, 0}, with \u03b71 6= \u00b1\u03b72 ,\nwhere \u03b71 , \u03b72 are roots of unity in Z[\u03bep ].\nCase 2. ordp (2) is even. In this case, each prime ideal divisor of (2) in Z[\u03bep ]\nis fixed by the complex conjugation. So fi = 2\u03bci for some root of unity \u03bci\n18\n\n\ffor each i. The same arguments as those in the above case work for this case;\nand there are also three possibilities as listed above. In particular, a, b, c, d are\nmultiples of 2\u2206 in case (1A) this time. In the following, we will consider the\nordp (2) even case and the ordp (2) odd case together.\nFirst we prove that Case (2B) does not occur. Assume to the contrary that\n\u03c7 := \u03c7u,u\u2032 with u\u2032 6= 0 is a character of H such that Case (2B) occurs. Then\n\u2032\n\u03c7(Ri ) = (1 \u2212 \u03bepl )\u03bepl \u01eb\u2206 for some i, where l \u2208 Z\u2217p and \u01eb = \u00b11. Since Ri meets\neach coset of N in H in a unique element we may write Ri = {(x, f (x)) : x \u2208\nZp }, where f : Zp \u2192 Zp is a function. Define F (x) := ux + u\u2032 f (x) \u2212 l\u2032 and\naj := |{x \u2208 Zp : F (x) = j}|, \u2200j \u2208 Zp . Then\n\u2032\n\u03c7(Ri )\u03bep\u2212l\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bepF (x)\n\n=\n\np\u22121\nX\n\naj \u03bepj\n\nj=0\n\nx\u2208Zp\n\n= (1 \u2212\n\n\u03bepl )\u01eb\u2206\n\n=\n\n\"\np\u22121\nX \u0010\nj=0\n\n#\n\nj \u0011 \u0010j \u2212 l\u0011 j\n\u2212\n\u01eb\u03bep .\np\np\n\nComparing theh coefficients of \u03be j on\nthe above equation, we find\ni the two sides ofP\np\u22121\n\u2212l\nthat aj \u2212a0 = ( pj )\u2212( j\u2212l\n)+(\n)\n\u01eb.\nTogether\nwith\nj=0 aj = p, we deduce that\np\np\nh\n\ni\n\n) \u01eb. We now show that there exists j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p \u2212 1, such\naj = 1 + ( pj ) \u2212 ( j\u2212l\np\nthat aj is negative. Let (RN) (resp. (NR)) be the number of pairs (x, x \u2212 l)\nin the set 1, 2, . . . , p \u2212 1 such that x (resp. x \u2212 l) is a non-zero square modulo\np and x \u2212 l (resp. x) is a non-square modulo p. Then by elementary number\ntheory (see, e.g. [11, p. 64]), we find that\np\u22121 1\n+ (\u03b4(\u2212l \u2208 Q) \u2212 \u03b4(l \u2208 Q)),\n4\n2\np\u22121 1\n\u2212 (\u03b4(\u2212l \u2208 Q) \u2212 \u03b4(l \u2208 Q)),\n(NR) =\n4\n2\n\n(RN) =\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the Kronecker delta function and Q is the set of nonzero squares\nmodulo p. Since p \u2265 5, both (RN) and (NR) are positive. Hence there exists j \u2208 Z\u2217p such that \u2212( pj ) = ( j\u2212l\n) = \u01eb. It follows that aj = \u22121 < 0: a\np\ncontradiction. Therefore Case (2B) can not occur.\nNext we show that Case (1A) does not occur. Assume to the contrary that\n\u03c7 := \u03c7u,u\u2032 with u\u2032 6= 0 is a character of H such that Case (1A) occurs. Then\nP\nP\nP\n\u03c7(Ri ) = ( j bj \u03bepj )\u2206 for some i, where ( j bj \u03bepj )( j bj \u03bep\u2212j ) = 4, bj \u2208 Z. Since Ri\nmeets each coset of N in H in a unique element we may write Ri = {(x, f (x)) :\nx \u2208 Zp }, where f : Zp \u2192 Zp is a function. Define F (x) := ux + u\u2032 f (x) and\nP\naj := |{x \u2208 Zp : F (x) = j}|. Then \u03c7(Ri ) = j aj \u03bepj . Multiplying both sides of\nthe following equation\nX\nj\n\naj \u03bepj\n\n=\n\nX \u0010j \u0011\nj\n\np\n\nby \u2206, we get\n19\n\n\u03bepj\n\n!\n\n\u0010X\nj\n\nbj \u03bepj\n\n\u0011\n\n\f\u0010X\n\naj \u03bepj\n\n\u0011 X \u0010 \u2212j \u0011\n\np\n\nj\n\nj\n\n!\n\n\u03bepj = p(\n\nX\n\nbj \u03bepj ).\n\nj\n\nThe following arguments are similar to those in the proof of Lemma 3.1. By\ncomparing coefficients of \u03bepk , we get\nX\n\nak\u2212j\n\nj\n\n\u0010 \u2212j \u0011\n\np\n\n= pbk \u2212 c, \u2200k \u2208 Zp\n\nfor some integer c. Summing the above equations over k, we get c = j bj .\nP\nP\nSince ( j bj \u03bepj )( j bj \u03bep\u2212j ) = 4, we have c2 \u2261 4 mod ((1 \u2212 \u03bep ) \u2229 Z), i.e., c2 \u2261 4\n(mod p). Hence c \u2261 \u00b12 (mod p). Write c = pc1 + 2\u01eb with \u01eb = \u00b11. Note that\nP\n\n|p(bk \u2212 c1 ) \u2212 2\u01eb| = |pbk \u2212 c| = |\n\nX\n\n\u2212j\n)| \u2264 p \u2212 ak \u2264 p.\np\n\nak\u2212j (\n\nj\n\nSo if \u01eb = 1, then \u03b4k := bk \u2212 c1 = 1 or 0. Since pc1 + 2 = j bj = j (c1 + \u03b4j ),\nP\nwe have j \u03b4j = 2. Hence only two of the \u03b4j 's are equal to 1. It follows that\nP\nj\ni1\ni2\ni1\ni2\nj bj \u03bep = \u03bep + \u03bep with i1 6= i2 \u2208 Zp . Now \u03bep + \u03bep clearly can not have\nmodulus 2: a contradiction. The case where \u01eb = \u22121 is similarly ruled out.\nP\n\nP\n\nSo we have proved that for each character \u03c7 of H that is non-principal on N\nonly Case (2A) can possibly occur. Write Ri := {(x, hi (x)) : x \u2208 Zp } \u2282 H for\nall i = 1, 2, 3, 4, where hi : Zp \u2192 Zp . For any \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 and \u03c7|N 6= 1, we have\n\u221a\n|\u03c7(Ri )| = p for each i. This implies that each hi is a p-ary bent function\nfrom Zp to itself. By Theorem 1.4, we have hi (x) = ai x2 + bi x + ci , ai 6= 0,\nai , bi , ci \u2208 Zp for each i. For any u \u2208 Zp , we write \u03c7u := \u03c7u,1 , which is a\ncharacter of H and whose restriction to N is non-principal. Define for each\nu \u2208 Zp the following 4-tuple\n(A1u , A2u , A3u , A4u ) = (\u03c7u (R1 ), \u03c7u (R2 ), \u03c7u (R3 ), \u03c7u (R4 )).\n\u2212(bi +u)2\n+ci\n4ai\n\n( api ) by direct computations. Hence to meet the\nWe have Aiu = \u2206\u03bep\nconditions in Case (2A), we must have three of ( api ) being equal and the fourth\nbeing distinct from them. Without loss of generality we assume that\n\u0010a \u0011\n1\n\np\n\n=\n\n\u0010a \u0011\n2\n\np\n\n=\n\n\u0010a \u0011\n3\n\np\n\n\u0010a \u0011\n\n=\u2212\n\n4\n\np\n\nFor each u \u2208 Zp , one of the following should occur:\n(i) A1u = A2u , A3u = \u2212A4u ;\n(ii) A1u = A3u , A2u = \u2212A4u ;\n(iii) A2u = A3u , A1u = \u2212A4u .\n20\n\n\fIf we are in Case (i), then a3 6= a4 since\n2\n\n\u0010\n\na3\np\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n=\u2212\n\na4\np\n\n\u0011\n\n2\n\n+u)\n, and \u2212 (b34a\n+ c3 =\n3\n\n+u)\n\u2212 (b44a\n+ c4 . The last equation is quadratic in u (the coefficient of u2 is\n4\na3 \u2212a4\n6= 0). Therefore there are at most two u's satisfying that equation. In\n4a3 a4\nother words, Case (i) occurs for at most two values of u. The same is true for\nthe other two cases. Now note that for any u \u2208 Zp , one of the above three\ncases must occur. It follows that p \u2264 6. Hence p = 5 (since p is assumed to be\ngreater than or equal to 5). It will be convenient to define\n\nU1 = {u \u2208 Z5 | A1u = A2u , A3u = \u2212A4u },\nU2 = {u \u2208 Z5 | A1u = A3u , A2u = \u2212A4u },\nU3 = {u \u2208 Z5 | A2u = A3u , A1u = \u2212A4u }.\nBy the above analysis, we have U1 \u222a U2 \u222a U3 = Z5 , 1 \u2264 |Ui | \u2264 2 for all i, and\nUi 6= Uj for 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 5.\nWe first claim that it is impossible to have a1 = a2 = a3 . If a1 = a2 , then\nb1 6= b2 since otherwise (a1 , b1 , c1 ) = (a2 , b2 , c2 ), which implies U2 = U3 , a\ncontradiction. Therefore, if a1 = a2 , then A1u = A2u becomes a degree one\nequation in u, which has at most one solution; hence |U1 | = 1. By the same\nreasoning we see that if a1 = a2 = a3 , then |U1 | = |U2 | = |U3 | = 1, which is\nclearly impossible.\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nNow recall that a51 = a52 = a53 . Since there are two non-zero squares and\ntwo nonsquares in Z5 , we must have two of a1 , a2 , a3 being equal. Without loss\nof generality assume that a1 = a2 = \u2212a3 . After replacing R by R\u03c3 g for some\ng \u2208 G and \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(G) which fixes elements of h\u03b11 i \u00d7 h\u03b12 i, we may assume\nthat h1 (x) = x2 (hence a1 = 1, b1 = c1 = 0). In the following we study the\ncase where a4 = 2. The case where a4 = \u22122 can be handled similarly.\nNow that we assumed a1 = a2 , by the above reasoning we must have b1 =\n6 b2 ,\nthat is b2 6= 0 since b1 is now assumed to be 0. We must have |U1 | = 1,\n|U2 | = |U3 | = 2, and U1 , U2 and U3 are mutually disjoint.\nSolving A1u = A2u , we see that the unique element of U1 is u = 2b2 \u2212\nwhich must also satisfy\nu2 + (\u2212b4 \u2212 2b3 )u + 2b24 \u2212 c4 + c3 \u2212 b23 = 0\n\nc2\n,\n2b2\n\n(4.5)\n\nThis last equation comes from A3u = \u2212A4u .\nAny element u \u2208 U2 must satisfy\n2u2 + 2b3 u + b23 \u2212 c3 = 0,\n3u2 + (\u2212b4 + 2b2 )u + 2b24 \u2212 c4 + c2 + b22 = 0.\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nSince |U2 | = 2, the two equations above should have two distinct common\n21\n\n\fsolutions. So by comparing coefficients we have b4 = 2b2 + 2b3 and 2b24 \u2212 c4 +\nb23 \u2212 c3 + b22 + c2 = 0.\nNow, u = 2b2 \u2212 2bc22 \u2208 U1 can not be a solution to (4.6). But adding twice of\n(4.6) to (4.5) gives u = 2b2 \u2212 2bc22 : a contradiction.\nWe have shown that for any character \u03c7 of H that is non-principal on N,\nnone of the cases 1A, 2A, 2B can occur. Therefore for an odd prime p \u2265 5, a\n(4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS in G cannot exist. The proof is complete.\n\u2737\nTheorem 4.2 Let p be an odd prime. Then there does not exist a (4p, p, 4p, 4)\nrelative difference set in G = Z4 \u00d7 Z2p .\n\nPROOF. We write G = h\u03b1 : \u03b14 = 1i \u00d7 Z2p and H := Z2p < G. Assume that\nR is a (4p, p, 4p, 4) RDS in G relative to a subgroup N of order p. Since the\nsubgroups of order p of G form a single orbit under the action of Aut(G), we\nmay choose N to be {0} \u00d7 Zp < H. By the definition of an RDS, we have\nRR(\u22121) = 4p + 4(G \u2212 N) in Z[G].\n\n(4.8)\n\nOn one hand, if \u03b8 \u2208 \u011c and \u03b8|N = 1, then by applying \u03b8 to both sides of (4.8)\nwe obtain that \u03b8(R) = 0. On the other hand, if \u03b8 \u2208 \u011c and \u03b8|N 6= 1, then by\napplying \u03b8 to both sides of (4.8) we obtain that \u03b8(R)\u03b8(R) = 4p; by the same\narguments as those at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 3.1, we find that\n\u03b8(R) = f (\u03bep )\u2206, where |f (\u03bep )|2 = 4 and f (x) \u2208 Z[x]. Write\nR = R0 + R1 \u03b11 + R2 \u03b12 + R3 \u03b13 ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere Rj \u2282 H for j = 0, 1, 2 and 3. Applying the characters of G whose\nrestrictions to H are trivial to both sides of (4.9), we have\n\n|R0 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |R3 | = 4p,\n|R0 | \u2212 |R1 | + |R2 | \u2212 |R3 | = 0,\n|R0 | + i|R1 | \u2212 |R2 | \u2212 i|R3 | = 0,\n|R0 | \u2212 i|R1 | \u2212 |R2 | + i|R3 | = 0,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere i2 = \u22121. From these equations, we find that |R0 | = |R1 | = |R2 | =\n|R3 | = p.\nFor any character \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 that is non-principal on N, write (a, b, c, d) =\n(\u03c7(R0 ), \u03c7(R1 ), \u03c7(R2 ), \u03c7(R3 )). By applying the characters of G whose restric22\n\n\ftions to H are \u03c7 we obtain\na + b + c + d = f1 (\u03bep )\u2206,\na \u2212 b + c \u2212 d = f2 (\u03bep )\u2206,\n|(a \u2212 c) + (b \u2212 d)i|2 = 4p,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere |fj (\u03bep )|2 = 4, j = 1, 2, with fj (x) \u2208 Z[x]. From the first two equations\nin (4.11), we find that 2(b + d) = \u2206(f1 \u2212 f2 ). Hence 2|(f1 \u2212 f2 ). By the same\narguments as those in the proof of Theorem 4.1, we deduce that f2 = f1 \u03b7 for\nsome 2pth root of unity \u03b7 \u2208 Z[\u03bep ]. We show that \u03b7 has to be \u00b11. Assume to\nthe contrary that \u03b7 6= \u00b11. Then from \u2206f1 (1 \u2212 \u03b7) = 2(b + d) and \u2206f1 (1 + \u03b7) =\n2(a + c) we find that 2|f1 . It follows that 2|f2 . We thus have f1 = 2\u03b71 and\nf2 = 2\u03b72 for some roots of unity \u03b71 , \u03b72 \u2208 Z[\u03bep ]. Denote a + c = (\u03b71 + \u03b72 )\u2206 by x\nand b + d = (\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 )\u2206 by y. Expanding |(a \u2212 c) + (b \u2212 d)i|2 = |(x \u2212 2c) + (y \u2212\n2d)i|2 = 4p and noting that 1, i are linearly independent over Z[\u03bep ], we get\nxc\u0304 + x\u0304c + y d\u0304 + \u0233d = 2cc\u0304 + 2dd\u0304,\n \u0304\nxd + \u0233c \u2212 yc\u0304 \u2212 x\u0304d \u2212 2cd \u0304 + 2dc\u0304 = p(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304).\nHere we have used the facts that xx\u0304 + y \u0233 = 4p and x\u0233 \u2212 x\u0304y = 2p(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304). In\nZ[\u03bep ], we have x \u2261 y (mod 2), x\u0304 \u2261 \u0233 (mod 2). So from the above two equations\nwe have p(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304) \u2261 0 (mod 2): a contradiction. Therefore we have proved that\n\u03b7 = \u00b11. It follows that for an arbitrary character \u03c7 of H that is non-principal\non N we have\nq\n\u03c7(R0 + R2 ) = 0, |\u03c7(R1 + R3 )| = 4p,\n\nor\n\n\u03c7(R1 + R3 ) = 0, |\u03c7(R0 + R2 )| =\n\nq\n\n4p.\n\nWe also note that for a nontrivial character \u03c7 of H that is principal on N we\nhave \u03c7(R0 + R2 ) = \u03c7(R1 + R3 ) = 0 (the argument is similar to the one we\nused to find |Rj |). By the inversion formula, the coefficient of the identity in\n(R0 + R2 )(R0 + R2 )(\u22121) is\n1\n4z\n(4p2 + 4pz) = 4 + ,\n2\np\np\nwhere\nz = |{\u03c7 \u2208 \u0124 : \u03c7|N 6= 1, |\u03c7(R0 + R2 )| =\n\nq\n\n4p}.\n\nHence we have p|z. Noting that the above set of characters is stable under\nthe action of Gal(Q(\u03bep )/Q) on \u0124, we see that its elements are partitioned\ninto orbits, each of size p \u2212 1. Hence (p \u2212 1)|z. So z = 0 or z = (p \u2212 1)p.\nIf z = (p \u2212 1)p, then \u03c7(R1 + R3 ) = 0 for all non-principal character \u03c7 of\nH. It follows that R1 + R3 = \u03bbH for some positive integer \u03bb. This is clearly\nimpossible since |R1 | = |R3 | = p. The case z = 0 is similarly ruled out. The\nproof is complete.\n\u2737\n23\n\n\fBy the analysis at the very beginning of this section, and combining Theorem 4.1 and 4.2 with the known example of a (12, 3, 12, 4) RDS in Z22 \u00d7 Z23 in\n[4] we have\nTheorem 4.3 Let p be an odd prime. An abelian group G of order 4p2 contains a (4p, p, 4p, 4) relative difference set if and only if G = Z22 \u00d7 Z23 .\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nA (v, k, \u03bb) difference set D in a non-abelian group of order v is said to be\ngenuinely non-abelian if none of the abelian groups of the same order contains a\ndifference set with these parameters. The first genuinely non-abelian difference\nset was constructed by K. Smith in [16], and its parameters are (100, 45, 20).\nWe define a genuinely non-abelian relative difference set in the analogous\nway. Combining the construction in Section 2 and the non-existence results\nin Section 4, we therefore have constructed an infinite family of genuinely\nnon-abelian semi-regular relative difference sets with parameters (4p, p, 4p, 4),\nwhere p \u2261 1 (mod 4) is a prime and p > 9.\nReferences\n[1] M.
