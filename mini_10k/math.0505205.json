Levi's book [10] about the\nsubject starts with the remark that they can be considered a starting point\nfor studying combinatorial geometry. It was also Levi who wrote in 1926\nthe first known paper [9] of pseudoline arrangements, the antecedent of the\ngeneral oriented matroid concept. Within this paper we use the latter concept in the context of configurations. We assume the reader to be familiar\nwith basic concepts from the theory of oriented matroids in the rank 3 case\n(see for instance [6] or [2, Chapter 6]). For an introduction to the theory of\noriented matroids see also [3].\nWe fix our notation in Section 2, however, an intuitive impression of a\nrealizable n4 -configuration can be obtained from looking at the smallest\nknown example of a realizable n4 -configuration for n = 21 in Figure 1. A\nrealizable n4 -configuration consists of two n element sets, a set of n points\nand a set of n lines in the Euclidean plane. The defining property of an n4 configuration requires each element of one set to be incident with precisely\n4 elements of the other.\nIt is known that realizable n4 -configurations do not exist for n \u2264 14. For\n15 \u2264 n \u2264 20 and for n = 22, 23, 26, 29, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 43, the existence\nof realizable n4 -configurations is a long standing problem in this context,\nwhereas for all other n, we do have realizable configurations (see [7]). For\nall even values that are larger than 21, realizations with pseudolines are\nknown. For the values n = 22 and n = 28 these can be found see [8]. For the\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The smallest known realizable n4 -configuration\nother values the realizations were unpublished; Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum provided\nus with his drawings (see Figure 8).\nIn Section 2 we prove a general Theorem 1, which implies in particular\nthat a realizable 154 -configuration does not exist. The proof for the case n =\n16 in Section 3 is more involved. Our results have been achieved without\nusing a computer in our final argument, although a foregoing result of the\nsecond author in connection with computations of Betten and Betten (see\n[1]) did use a computer in the case n = 16. In Section 4 we give an overview\nof this foregoing result.\n2. O N\n\nGENERAL\n\nnk - CONFIGURATIONS\n\nAn nk -configuration (with k \u2265 3) is a matroid M of rank 3 on n points\nsuch that every line of M has at most k points and each point is contained\nin exaktly k k-point lines. We say that an nk -configuration is in general\nposition, if the only number of points on a line is either k or 2.\nT HEOREM 1. A realizable nk -configuration can only exist if n > k2 + k \u2212 5\nholds. This implies that a realizable 154 -configuration does not exist.\nLet C be a nk -configuration. If an arrangement of pseudolines has exactly\nthe incidences prescribed by C , we say that C is realizable with pseudolines; or short pl-realizable. By the Folkman-Lawrence representation theorem (for an elementary proof in the rank-3-case, see [4]) this is equivalent\nto the fact that the matroid M underlying C is orientable. Our definition\nof pl-realizablity implies that every realizable configuration \u2013 that is one\nthat can be drawn with straight lines in the projective plane \u2013 is also plrealizable. So pl-realizability is a necessary condition for realizabilty in the\nordinary sense.\nWe only have to deal with points of C in general position:\n\n\fTHERE ARE NO REALIZABLE 154 - AND 164 -CONFIGURATIONS\n\n3\n\nRemark. Let C be a pl-realizable nk -configuration. Then there exists a plrealizable nk -configuration C \u2032 such that C \u2032 is in general position.\nWe note that we can always change to polar formulation where we switch\nthe roles of points and lines.\nProof of Theorem 1. The result follows from an application of Euler's formula. We may assume that C is in general position. We assume further\nthat we are given a pl-realization of C on the sphere. This induces a graph\nembedding on the sphere.\nWe count the number\nof vertices\n\u0011 and edges. The number of vertices is\n\u0010\nk\u0001\nn\u0001\ngiven by f0 = 2 n + 2 \u2212 n 2 = n(n \u2212 k(k \u2212 1) + 1). The number of\n\nedges is given by f1 = 2n (k + (n \u2212 k(k \u2212 1) \u2212 1)) = 2n(n \u2212 k2 + 2k \u2212 1).\nFrom Euler's formula we can deduce the number of cells: f2 = f1 \u2212 f0 + 2.\nA pseudoline-arrangement as a pl-realization of C implies that digons are\nnot allowed. By double-counting edge-cell incidences we get the following\nadditional inequality: 3 f2 \u2264 2 f1 . Plugging in the above expressions for f0 ,\nf1 , and f2 our inequality becomes:\n\u2212n2 \u2212 5 n + nk2 + nk + 6 \u2264 0.\nFor fixed k \u2265 3 and nonnegative n the expression on the left-hand-side is\nmonotonically decreasing. For n = k2 + k \u2212 5 the inequality does not hold\nwhereas for n = k2 + k \u2212 4 the inequality holds.\n\u0003\nRemark. The proof allows us to replace realizable with pl-realizable in the\nstatement of Theorem 1.\nC OROLLARY 1. Realizable 154 -configurations do not exist.\nWe are using the fact that two nk -configurations in general position are\n\u03c0 -equivalent; they have the same Poincar\u00e9 polynomial (for a definition, see\nthe book by Orlik and Terao [11]).\n3. T HE C ASE n = 16\nThe aim of this section is to prove the following theorem:\nT HEOREM 2. Realizable 164 -configurations do not exist.\nWe start of with some convenient definitions: We call the intersection\npoint between pseudolines crossing. We call such a point an n-crossing if\nexactly n pseudolines go through that point. As in the section above we\nassume that our configuration is in general position. So, we only have to\ndeal with 2- and 4-crossings. We pick an arbitrary pseudoline as line at\ninfinity in our arrangement and we denote it with \u221e.\n\n\f4\n\nJ\u00dcRGEN BOKOWSKI AND LARS SCHEWE\n\nIn the case n = 16 we have to have exactly four 4-crossings and three 2crossings on each pseudoline. This means that we have two 4-crossings that\nare adjacent on our pseudoline \u221e. Now call the elements that intersect in\nthese two 4-crossings a, b, c, and d, e, f , respectively. These six pseudolines\nhave to have nine additional distinct crossings which we label from A to I as\nin Figure 2(a). We call these crossings also grid points to distinguish them\nfrom other crossings. Note that we have chosen our starting situation so\nthat no pseudoline in our arrangement can go to \u221e between the pseudolines\nc and d above A and no pseudoline can go to \u221e between a and f below I.\nAll the pseudolines a,. . . , f cross \u221e in a 4-crossing. This means that they\ncontain only six further crossings in total: three 4-crossings and three 2crossings. We further remark that at most nine and at least six of the grid\npoints have to be 4-crossings.\nHowever, not all nine grid points can be 4-crossings. This follows from\nthe following Lemma.\nc\n\nc\n\nd\n\nd\nb\n\nb\n\ne\n\ne\nA\n\na\n\nA\n\na\n\nf\n\nf\nB\n\nD\n\nB\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nD\n\nF\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nH\n\nF\n\nH\n\nI\n\nI\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nF IGURE 2.\nL EMMA 1. The grid points A and I cannot be both 4-crossings.\nProof. Assume both A and I were 4-crossings. Then the two non-grid pseudolines leaving A have to cross the line b in two distinct crossings that both\nlie above B. However, the two non-grid pseudolines leaving I have to cross\nb in two distinct crossings as well, but those crossings have to lie below H.\nSo we get four additional crossings to the crossings B, E, and H on b. This\nis a contradiction.\n\u0003\nIf eight grid points are 4-crossings, we may assume that one of the points\nA or I is a 2-crossing. Now we can show that the case of eight 4-crossings\nin the grid cannot occur.\nL EMMA 2. At most seven grid points can be 4-crossings.\n\n\fTHERE ARE NO REALIZABLE 154 - AND 164 -CONFIGURATIONS\n\n5\n\nProof. We cannot have nine grid points that are 4-crossings. This would\ncontradict Lemma 1. So, assume we had eight grid points that were 4crossings. We may then assume w.l.o.g. that A is a 4-crossing and I is not.\nSo we are in the situation of Figure 2(a). We can then see that the new\npseudolines leaving C have to cross b in at least one new crossing. The new\npseudolines leaving G have to cross b in at least one new crossing as well.\nHowever, this would give us seven crossings on b, which is impossible. \u0003\nNow we deal with the case that A and I are both 2-crossings.\nL EMMA 3. The grid points A and I cannot be both 2-crossings.\nProof. Assume both were 2-crossings. Then at most one further grid point\nis a 2-crossing. So w.l.o.g. we are in the situation of Figure 2(b). No 4crossings can lie in the bold 1-cells of c, otherwise we would get too many\ncrossings on f . By symmetry the same holds for the bold 1-cells of g. So\nwe know the 1-cells in which the further 4-crossings on c resp. g lie. We\ncount the number of lines entering the 2-cell on the right which is bordered\nby the dashed line. This number is ten, but only nine lines are leaving this\ncell to cross \u221e, which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nFrom now on we can always assume that A is a 4-crossing, I is a 2crossing and we have at least one and at most two further grid points that\nare 2-crossings. First we deal with the case that precisely one further grid\npoint is a 2-crossing.\nc\n\nc\n\nd\n\nd\n\nb\n\nb\n\ne\n\ne\nA\n\na\n\nA\n\na\nf\n\nB\n\nD\n\nf\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nB\n\nF\n\nD\n\nH\n\nC\n\nE\n\nG\n\nI\n\nF\n\nH\n\nI\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nF IGURE 3.\nL EMMA 4. At most six grid points can be 4-crossings.\nProof. We deal with two cases seperately: First we assume E is our further\n2-crossing. Then we are in the situation of Figure 3(a). The bold 1-cells\n\n\f6\n\nJ\u00dcRGEN BOKOWSKI AND LARS SCHEWE\n\ncannot contain a 4-crossing. This would lead to too many crossings on line\nb, or e, respectively. So one 4-crossing has to lie above the point C on e.\nNow there are again ten pseudolines entering the 2-cell which is bordered\nby the dashed line, but again only nine pseudolines form our arrangement.\nThis is the desired contradiction in this case.\nSo we may assume E is a 4-crossing. So we are in the situtation of\nFigure 3(b). By symmetry we can assume w.l.o.g. that G is a 4-crossing.\nNow, however, H has to be a 4-crossing as well, otherwise we would get a\ncontradiction. The two lines coming from G cross b in two points. If one\nof these was not H, we would have eight crossings on b. So both G and H\nhave to be 4-crossings.\nNow by symmetry we may assume that C is a 4-crossing. Then the two\nlines coming from C that cross b give at least one new crossing on b. Together with the crossing that H gave, we have eight crossings in total. This\nis our desired contradiction. So we have shown that no seven grid points can\nbe 4-crossings.

Assume A, F, and H are 4-crossings and I is a 2-crossing. Then\nC is a 4-crossing.\nProof. This is the situation of Figure 4(a). Assume C is a 2-crossing. If\nthere was a 4-crossing on f below F, we would get too many crossings\non b. However, no 4-crossing can lie above F on c as well, we would get\ntoo many crossings on f . So we get one 4-crossing above F on f and\none 4-crossing below F on c. Now the cell bounded by the dashed line is\n\n\fTHERE ARE NO REALIZABLE 154 - AND 164 -CONFIGURATIONS\n\n7\n\nentered by ten pseudolines. This is a contradiction. Hence, C has to be a\n4-crossing.\n\u0003\nThe next lemma reduces the possibilities further.\nL EMMA 6. The situation that A, C, F, and H are 4-crossings and G and I\nare 2-crossings cannot occur.\nProof. This is the situation of Figure 4(b). As can be seen in the figure, the\nlines coming from H that cross a give too many crossings on e.

The situation, that the grid points D, E, and I are 2-crossings\ncannot occur.\n\n\f8\n\nJ\u00dcRGEN BOKOWSKI AND LARS SCHEWE\n\nProof. This is the situation of Figure 6. No 4-crossings may lie on b below\nH. Also no 4-crossings may lie on d above B. Additionally, no 4-crossing\nlies on a below D. So the two further 4-crossings on a have to lie above\nD. This means, however, that no 4-crossing on d can lie below D. Hence,\nthe missing 4-crossing on d has to lie between D and B. Now we have five\nfurther lines \u2013 coming from the new 4-crossing and G \u2013 that need to cross b\nbelow B. We only have one further 4-crossing that lies on b, which can only\nlie in the segment denoted by the dotted line. This means that we only have\ntwo possible exit points for the above mentioned five lines. This, however,\nleads to a contradiction. The three lines coming from the new 4-crossing on\nd need to cross b in three pairwise distinct crossings.\n\u0003\nNow, we take on the last \u2013 and hardest \u2013 case.\n\nc\n\nc\n\nd\n\nd\nK\n\nb\n\nb\ne\n\ne\nA\n\na\n\nB\n\nC\nX\n\nD\n\nA\n\na\n\nJ\n\nL\n\nf\n\nf\n\nB\n\ng\n\nC\n\nM\n\nE\n\nF\n\nD\n\nh\n\nE\n\nF\n\nO\n\nY\nG\n\nG\n\nH\n\nH\n\nI\n\nI\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nF IGURE 7.\nL EMMA 8. The situation, that the grid points G, H, and I are 2-crossings\ncannot occur.\nProof. This is the situation of Figure 7(a). We see that no 4-crossing can\nlie on a below D. No 4-crossing can lie on b below E. By symmetry no\n4-crossing can lie on e below E, and no 4-crossing can lie on f below F.\nThe drawing in Figure 7(b) shows that the 4-crossings that are missing on\nb and e cannot both lie directly above E. We may assume that the missing\n4-crossing on e lies above C; we call it J. The other line coming from A\ncrosses e in a 2-crossing, which means that only one further crossing lies\non e.\nNow we see that the five lines that come from C and J have to cross f\nabove F. They have the possibility to cross f in the two missing 4-crossings\non f , which have to lie above F; we call them K and L. This takes care of\n\n\fTHERE ARE NO REALIZABLE 154 - AND 164 -CONFIGURATIONS\n\n9\n\nfour of the five lines. However, one of the lines cannot go through K or L, it\nyields a new 2-crossing on f . So, all the crossings on f are now determined.\nNow we take a closer look at K and L. Of the two lines that come from\nA at least one has to cross f in K or L \u2013 the other one could go through J\nand leads to the above mentioned 2-crossing. Together with the four lines\nthat come from C and J five of the six lines that go through K and L are\ndetermined. So exactly one of the lines that go through K and L does not\ncross e in C or J; we call this line g.\nTo determine the place where g crosses e, we first look at the lines that\ncome from F. The two additional lines coming from F have to cross e\nbelow C. However, we have already determined two 2-crossings on e, and\nonly one 4-crossing lies below C. One of the lines leaving F has to cross\ne in E, and the other has to cross it in a 2-crossing which either lies above\nE or below E; we call these lines h and i. If i crosses e above E, we call\nthe resulting crossing X , and if i crosses e below E, we call the resulting\ncrossing Y . All 2-crossings are now determined, so g has to cross e in E.\nNow we have two cases. If i crosses e in X , i has first to cross g. We call\nthis crossing M. This crossing M, however, has to be a 2-crossing. We have\nalready determined all lines that enter the 2-cell bordered by C, E, F, and\nH, and there are simply not enough of them to make M a 4-crossing. The\n4-crossings E and F are adjacent on h, no lines cross between them. And\nthe segment between them borders two triangles which have a 2-crossing as\nthe remaining vertex. So, if we take h to be the line at infinity, we are in the\nsituation of Lemma 2(b), which settles this case.\nIf i crosses e in Y , then i has to cross b in a 2-crossing between E and H,\nwe call it O. Now we look at the points M, F, O, E, we are again in the\nsituation of Lemma 2(b) using h as line at infinity.\n\u0003\nSo, with the proof of this lemma, we have settled all cases in which six\ngrid points were 4-crossings. We already know, however that no more than\nsix grid points can be 4-crossings (Lemma 4), and we also know that no\nless than six grid points can be 4-crossings. This concludes the proof of\nTheorem 2.\nRemark. We can replace realizable with pl-realizable in Theorem 2.\n4. F URTHER R EMARKS\nAll n4 -configurations up to n = 17 have been classified by Betten and Betten [1]. They have shown that there exist only 19 different 164 -configurations.\nThis result gives us all possible matroids that can lead to (pl-)realizable\n164 -configurations. Such a configuration can only be pl-realizable, when\nthe matroid is orientable. Using software, written by the second author,\n\n\f10\n\nJ\u00dcRGEN BOKOWSKI AND LARS SCHEWE\n\nwe can decide whether a matroid is orientable. The program tries to find a\nbase orientation for the given matroid that satisfy the Grassmann-Pl\u00fcckerRelations. In all 19 cases found by Betten and Betten the matroid was not\norientable, thus giving another proof of Theorem 2.\nWe are optimistic that further arguments in connection with computer\nsupport might lead to results in other cases as well.\nAfter this article was written, Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum has sent us his pseudoline arrangements of Figure 8.\n\n(a) 264\n\n(b) 324\n\n(c) 344\n\n(d) 384\n\nF IGURE 8.
