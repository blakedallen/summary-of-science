Introduction\nQuantum information processing (QIP) with solid state devices is currently a highly\nchallenging, though not impossible, task in quantum computation and quantum\nsimulation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Due to decoherence [6, 7], quantum information stored in\nphysical systems is much more fragile than classical information in terms of fidelity\npreservation; it is expected that quantum error correction (QEC) [8] will play an\nimportant role to maintain the fidelity of the phase sensitive quantum states. In the\nstandard paradigm of QEC, it is crucial that spatially correlated errors (at least on\nthe same logical qubit) have to be avoided. On the other hand, to minimize thermal\nnoises in solid state systems, it is often preferable to lower the operating temperatures.\nThis, however, would typically increase the \"quantumness\" of the noises. For example,\nindirect interaction between qubits would be induced through the interaction with the\nenvironment (for a related recent review, see e.g. [9]). To avoid the \"attacks\" of\ncorrelated errors, it is conceivably advantageous to encode logical qubits over spatially\nseparated physical qubits.\nTo allow the physically separated qubits to communicate with each other, it is\nnecessary that some sort of robust quantum channels are available. This problem\nis often called the quantum state transfer (QST) problem. Lots of different state\ntransfer schemes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] and further development\n[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] have been proposed in recent years (earlier\nreferences can be traced from here [32]). However, most of them focus only on onedimensional and single qubit transfer. For this reason, this work is motivated to fill up\nthe gap, or stimulate the development in this direction.\nWe are interested in the problem of connecting different parts of a quantum network.\nIn classical computing networks, this function is carried out by network hubs and/or\nswitches [33]. Likewise, quantum switches are conceivably necessary for building up\nquantum networks. In this work, we show that a group of permanently coupled spins\nin the star topology [34, 35, 36] can function as a quantum switch by varying the local\npotentials only. Any quantum state initialized at one spin at the edge (called node)\nwill be transfered to any other node through the natural Hamiltonian evolution. Note\nthat this is not the same as the method of quantum cloning [37, 38], as the final state\nis required to be perfectly transferred to a specific node only.\nWe note that the solution to this problem is not unique; there are at least two\nalternatives ways of achieving the same goal. First, if we have perfect controls over\nthe interaction between the spins, then one can simply perform a swap operation from\nnode A to the central node, and then another swap to node B. Second, if the spins\nare permanently coupled, but strong local pulses are available to effectively control\npairwise interactions, as in the case of NMR quantum computing [39], then quantum\nstates can be swapped through as well. These two conditions, namely full control\nand strong local pulses, are not necessary available in many proposals of solid state\nimplementations. Here we assume that we do not have these conditions i.e., spins are\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Quantum state transfer with a permanently coupled spin star. Each node\nmay be a port connecting another part of the network. a) By engineering the right set\nof local potentials, a quantum state can be transfered from node 1 to node 2 under the\nfree Hamiltonian evolution. b) The state can also be selectively transferred to another\nnode by adjusting the local potentials.\n\npermanently\n\u221a coupled and local potential can be varied only mildly (it turns out to\nscale as N , cf Eq. (40)). In the following, we shall adopt the approach of spin-chain\nengineering problem [40, 41, 42, 43] which aims at minimize dynamical controls by\nachieving quantum state transfer with the free Hamiltonian evolution (see Fig. 1). It\nhas been [44] pointed out that such approach is less affected by the gate control noise.\nOur strategy is to change the local potentials acting on different sites; similar, but not\nidentical, idea has been explored in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic chain [30].\n2. Definition of the QST problem\nTo solve this problem, we need to \"engineer\", or design, a suitable Hamiltonian for a\nsystem with N +1 spins (N edge nodes and 1 central node). Inspired by the spin-chain\nengineering problem, we consider a Hamiltonian of the following form:\nH=\n\nN \u0010\nN\n\u0011 X\n\u0011\n\u03c90 X\n\u03bbj \u0010 z\n\u03c30x \u03c3jx + \u03c30y \u03c3jy +\n\u03c3j + 1 .\n2 j=1\nj=0 2\n\n(1)\n\nHere we assume that the couplings \u03c90 between the edge spins and the central spin are\nthe same, but the local potentials \u03bbj could be varied. The \u03c3j 's are the standard Pauli\nmatrices acting on the node j. With the Hamiltonian H, we define\nU (t) \u2261 e\u2212iHt\n\n(2)\n\nto be the time evolution operator for a period of time t. Note that [H, \u03c3z ] = 0, the\nHamiltonian H can be block-diagonalized by the basis consisting of fixed number of\nspin-up's and down's. Therefore, H is spin-conserving. This implies that\nU |00 01 02 ...0N i = |00 01 02 ...0N i\n\n(3)\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n4\n\nfor all times. Suppose at t = 0, nodes 1 is encoded with an arbitrary qubit state\n\u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhile the rest are in the definite state |0i, the qubit is said to be (perfectly) transfered\nto node k at t = \u03c4 , whenever (up to a phase factor)\nU (\u03c4 ) |00 11 02 03 ...0k ...0N i = |00 01 02 03 ...1k ...0N i\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\n2.1. Transformation to a four-spin problem\nThe question is what values of \u03c90 , \u03bbj and \u03c4 would make perfect QST (Eq.(5)) possible?\nTo answer this question, we note that we can confine ourselves to the single-spin subspace\ndefined by\n{|0i \u2261 |10 01 02 ...0N i , |1i \u2261 |00 11 02 ...0N i , ...}.\n\n(6)\n\nIn this subsapce, the Hamiltonian HS is of the arrow-head form:\n\uf8eb\n\nHS =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03bb0 \u03c90 \u03c90\n\u03c90 \u03bb1 0\n\u03c90 0 \u03bb2\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n\u03c90 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n* * * \u03c90\n\uf8f7\n*** 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n*** 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n. . \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n* * * \u03bbN\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nWithout loss of generality, we consider state transfer from node 1 to node 2. The\ntransition amplitude can be expanded by the following:\nh2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i =\n\nN\nX\n\nh2|ek i hek |1i e\u2212iEk \u03c4\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere |ek i is an eigenvector of HS , and Ek the corresponding eigenvalue.\nFor the purpose of performing perfect state transfer, we require\n|h2| U |1i| = 1 .\n\n(9)\n\nGenerally, it is in principle possible to choose any complex phase for Eq. (8), i.e.\nh1| U |2i\u2217 = h2| U |1i = ei\u03c6 . However, for simplicity, we consider the special case\nh2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i = h1| U (\u03c4 ) |2i = 1 .\n\n(10)\n\nIn this way, any state initialized in the state \u03b1 |000...0i + \u03b2 |1i will be transformed into\nthe state \u03b1 |000...0i + \u03b2 |2i under the action of U (\u03c4 ). Then, Eq. (10) implies that\nh1| e\u2212iP HS P \u03c4 |2i = h1| e\u2212iHS \u03c4 |2i\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\nP \u2261 |2i h1| + |1i h2| +\n\nN\nX\n\n|ki hk|\n\n(12)\n\nk=3\n\nis the permutation operator for node 1 and 2. This suggests that HS is invariant about\nthe exchange of the two spin positions:\nP HS P = HS ,\n\n(13)\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n5\n\nIn other words, HS must be symmetrical with respect to node 1 and 2. Therefore,\nwe need to set\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nNow, suppose we further impose a symmetry condition for the other spins, and set\n\u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = ... = \u03bbN\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nthen within the subspace {|0i , |3inew , |1i , |2i}, where\n\u221a\n|3inew \u2261 (|3iold + |4i + ... + |N i) / M ,\n\n(16)\n\nThe Hamiltonian is reduced into a 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian H4 in the following form:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\nH4 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\na\nb\nc\nc\n\nb\nd\n0\n0\n\nc\n0\ne\n0\n\nc\n0\n0\ne\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\na \u2261 \u03bb0 ,\n\u221a\nb \u2261 M \u03c90\nc \u2261 \u03c90\n\n(18)\n,\n\n,\n\nd \u2261 \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = ... = \u03bbN\ne \u2261 \u03bb1 = \u03bb2\n\n,\n\n.\n\nThis fact can be readily checked by direct multiplication. Explicitly,\nH |0i = \u03bb0 |0i +\nH |3i =\n\n\u221a\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c90 |ki + \u03c90 |1i + \u03c90 |2i = a |0i + b |3i + c |1i + c |2i ,\n\nk=3\n\nM \u03c90 |0i + \u03bb3 |3i = b |0i + d |3i ,\n\nH |1i = \u03c90 |0i + \u03bb1 |1i = c |0i + e |1i ,\nH |2i = \u03c90 |0i + \u03bb2 |2i = c |0i + e |2i .\n\n(19)\n\nTherefore, the M \u2261 N \u22122 edge spins act effectively as a single \"renormalized\" spin,\nwith\n\u03c90\n\n\u2192\n\n\u221a\n\u03c90 M\n\n(20)\n\nbut local potentials \u03bbk (k \u2265 3) unchanged. The many-spin problem is then reduced to a\nfour-spin problem; a very similar procedure was described in the work of Burgarth and\nBose [45].\nThe transition amplitude h2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i is still given by the form of Eq. (8) provided\nthat we now consider |ek i and Ek as the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of H4 and sum\nup to N \u2192 3, and adopt the new basis {|0i , |3inew , |1i , |2i}.\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n6\n\n2.2. Exchange symmetry\nHere we shall further exploit the advantages gained from the exchange symmetry. Since\nby definition\nP2 = P\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nthe requirement\nP H4 P = H4\n\n(22)\n\nor equivalently [P, H4 ] = 0 implies that the eigenvectors of H4 are also eigenvectors of\nP , with eigenvalues \u00b11. Consider explicitly the eigenvalue equation\nH4 |ek i = Ek |ek i\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nBy direct substitution, the vector (0, 0, 1, \u22121)T is an eigenvector of H4 with eigenvalue\ne. By inspection, it is also an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue \u22121.\nFor Ek 6= e, we shall assume that the exchange of 1 and 2 gives no phase change.\nIn other words,\nP |ek i = \u2212 1 |ek i\n\nfor Ek = e ,\n\nP |ek i = + 1 |ek i\n\nfor Ek 6= e .\n\n(24)\n\nConsequently, Eq. (8) becomes\nh2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i =\n\nN\nX\n\nh1| (P |ek i) hek |1i e\u2212iEk \u03c4\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nk=0\n\nTo satisfy the perfect state transfer condition, or h2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i = 1. It is necessary that\nthe phase factors e\u2212iEk \u03c4 can cancel the \u00b11 phase according to Eq. (24).\nIt is remarkable that this property is highly analogous to that [41] in the 1-D\nspin-chain engineering problem. In fact, with the knowledge of the eigenvalues and the\nexchange properties of the eigenvectors, one can determine the matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian H4 . This type of problem is called inverse eigenvalue problem [46].\n3. Mapping to an inverse eigenvalue problem\nInverse eigenvalues problems are often more challenging than the ordinary eigenvalue\nproblems. In particular, not many analytic solutions have been obtained in the spinchain engineering problem. Fortunately, because our (N + 1)-spin problem is now\neffectively a four-spin problem, the inverse eigenvalue problem is exactly solvable.\nWith Eq. (24), to ensure we have h2| U (\u03c4 ) |1i = 1 in Eq. (8), consider Eq. (25).\nThe goal is to choose the phase factors e\u2212iEk \u03c4 to cancel the phase factors \u00b11 due to the\nexchange operator P . We set for Ek = e,\ne\u03c4 = \u03c0\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nand for Ek 6= e, we set Ek \u03c4 = 0, \u00b12n\u03c0, where n is a positive integer. This can be\nachieved by choosing the following eigenvalue spectrum\n{0, e, \u00b1\u03b7e}\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n7\n\nGiven any\n\u03b7 = 2n ,\n\n(28)\n\nif we know a solution of e satisfying Eq. (32) for the Hamiltonian H4 , then at\nt = \u03c4 = \u03c0/e ,\n\n(29)\n\ncombining Eq. (24), Eq. (8) and the conditions above, we have h2| U (\u03c0/e) |1i = 1 and\nthe state transfer problem can be solved.\n4. Solution to the inverse eigenvalue problem\nWe shall briefly describe how the solutions (i.e., to determine a set of {a, b, c, d, e}) to\nthe inverse eigenvalue problem can be found and skip technical details. To get started,\nconsider the characteristic polynomial of H4 :\np (\u03bb) \u2261 det |H4 \u2212 \u03bb| / (e \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere det |H4 \u2212 \u03bbI| = (e \u2212 \u03bb) [(a \u2212 \u03bb) (d \u2212 \u03bb) (e \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 b2 (e \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 2c2 (d \u2212 \u03bb)]. Here\n\u03bb is the variable of the function p(\u03bb). To simplify the notation, we write\np (\u03bb) = \u039b0 e3 + \u039b1 e2 \u03bb + \u039b2 e\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 ,\n\n(31)\n\ne3 \u039b0 = ade \u2212 b2 e \u2212 2c2 d ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere\ne2 \u039b1 = b2 + 2c2 \u2212 ad \u2212 (a + d) e ,\ne \u039b2 = a + d + e .\nWith the eigenvalue spectrum chosen to be {0, e, \u00b1\u03b7e}, where \u03b7 is a tuning\nparameter. We also have det |H4 \u2212 \u03bb| = \u03bb (e \u2212 \u03bb) (\u03b7 2 e2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ) = (e \u2212 \u03bb) (\u03b7 2 e2 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb3 ).\nComparing it with Eq. (31), we have\n\u039b0 = \u039b2 = 0\n\n(33)\n\n\u039b1 = \u03b7 2\n\n(34)\n\nand\n.\n\nFor simplicity, we measure all quantities in unit of c, or equivalently set c = 1 and hence\nb2 = M\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwhich means that b and c is nowdetermined.\nEliminating a and d in Eq. (32), we have\ngM (e; \u03b7) \u2261 x0 + x2 e2 + x4 e4 + x6 e6 = 0 ,\n\n(36)\n\nx0 = M + 2 ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\nx2 = 3 \u2212 \u03b7 2\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\nx4 = (3/2) 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2\nx6 = (1/4) 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2\n\n,\n.\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n8\n\nGiven \u03b7 and M , as we have fixed b and c, our goal is to find e (and hence a and d)\nwhich solves Eq. (32). This can be done efficiently using any numerical method. The\nkey point here is that the complexity for solving the problem does not scale with the\nnumber of spins N involved.\n4.1. Examples\nAs an example, for M = 2 (i.e., 4+1 spins), we can choose \u03b7 = 4 (i.e., with eigenvalue\nspectrum {0, e, \u00b14e}), one of the solutions is e = \u2212d = 0.516, a = 0 and of course\n\u221a\nc = 1 and b = 2. Note that the local potentials e and d are roughly the same order as\nthe couplings c. Consequently, a qubit of information encoded at node 1 at time t = 0\nwill evolve to node 2 at t = \u03c0/e under the free evolution of this Hamiltonian, and the\nproblem is solved. The fidelity as a function of time is shown in Figure 2.\n345\" 1.0\n\n365\" 1.0\n\nM=2\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n./01\"2\"\n\n375\" 1.0\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n385\"\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n./01\"2\"\n\n20\n\n25\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n./01\"2\"\n\n10\n\n385\" 1.0\n\nM = 20\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\nM=4\n\n0.8\n\n30\n\n12\n\nM = 100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n./01\"2\"\n\n50\n\n60\n\n!\"\n\n#\"\n\n$\"\n\n%\"\n\n&\"\n\n'\"\n\n!\"\n\n#$%&\"\n\n#$&#\"\n\n#\"\n\n'!$(#\"\n\n)$*((\"\n\n&\"\n\n!$%&\"\n\n!$))\"\n\n#\"\n\n'+$++\"\n\n)$&,-\"\n\n!)\"\n\n($*-\"\n\n&$&*\"\n\n#\"\n\n'($,(\"\n\n)$!)%\"\n\n#))\"\n\n#-$+\"\n\n#)$)\"\n\n#\"\n\n'#-$&\"\n\n)$),!\"\n\nFigure 2. Quantum state transfer with a permanently coupled spin star of M + 2 + 1\nspins, where M is the number of spins get normalized (see Eq. (16)). The vertical\n2\naxis is F (t) \u2261 |h2| U (t) |1i| , the transfer fidelity; it reaches the maximum (F = 1)\nwhen t = \u03c0/e, which corresponds to a perfect state transfer from state |1i to |2i.\nFigure (a)-(d) show the cases of different values of M . Figure (d) is a table listing the\ncorresponding matrix elements of the Hamiltonian defined in Eq. (17).\n\nSuppose we now want to transfer the state from node 1 to node 3 instead of 2, as\nthe couplings \u03c90 are all the same, we just need to exchange the local potential between 2\n\n\fSpin Star as a Switch for Quantum Networks\n\n9\n\nand 3, \u03bb2 \u2194 \u03bb3 . Practically, we may apply a global offset field, so that only the \"active\"\nnodes are subject to some non-zero potentials, and all other \u03bbk = 0 (or some constant\nvalue).\n4.2. Scaling Analysis\nLastly, to complete our discussion, we should also consider the constraints of \u03b7 which\nat this point seems to be arbitrary. In fact, to ensure (a pair of) real roots of gM (e; \u03b7)\nexist, we require the global minimum of gM (e\u2217 ; \u03b7) (denote the corresponding value of e\nas e\u2217 ), as a function of e, to be less than zero. We found\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011 \u0010\n(38)\ne2\u2217 = 6 + 2 3\u03b7 /3 \u03b7 2 \u2212 1\nwhich suggests that \u03b7 > 1. The condition gM (e\u2217 ; \u03b7) < 0 implies that\n\u221a\n4 3 \u03b73\n>N .\n9 \u03b72 \u2212 1\n\n(39)\n\nFor large N\u221a, \u03b7 needs to be at least of order O(N ). Therefore, from Eq. (38), e is of\norder O(1/ M ). In this limit, from Eq. (32), we have the local fields\n\u221a\n(40)\na \u2248 \u2212d \u2248 O( M ).\nAll of these are in agreement with the numerical results in Fig. 2.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated how the spin-chain engineering problem can\nbe generalized to the topology of spin-star, which can be potentially useful to function as\na switching device for building up quantum networks. Our main idea is the reduction of\nthe many-spin problem to a four-spin problem which is exactly solvable. Together with\none-dimensional chains, this result allows the quantum state transfer to more general\nquantum networks, e.g. consisting of superconducting devices [47].\nAcknowledgments\nM.H.Y. are grateful to the funding sources: NSF grant EIA-01-21568 and Croucher\nFoundation.\n[1] M.A. Nielsen and I.L.
