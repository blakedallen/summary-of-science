We investigate the thermal and kinematic configuration of a sunspot penumbra using very high spectral and spatial\nresolution intensity profiles of the non-magnetic Fe \uf769 557.6 nm line. The dataset was acquired with the 2D solar spectrometer\nTESOS. The profiles are inverted using a one-component model atmosphere with gradients of the physical quantities. From\nthis inversion we obtain the stratification with depth of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and microturbulence across the\npenumbra. Our results suggest that the physical mechanism(s) responsible for the penumbral filaments operate preferentially\nin the lower photosphere. We confirm the existence of a thermal asymmetry between the center and limb-side penumbra, the\nformer being hotter by 100-150 K on average. We also investigate the nature of the bright ring that appears in the inner penumbra\nwhen sunspots are observed in the wing of spectral lines. It is suggested that the bright ring does not reflect a temperature\nenhancement in the mid photospheric layers. The line-of-sight velocities retrieved from the inversion are used to determine the\nflow speed and flow angle at different heights in the photosphere. Both the flow speed and flow angle increase with optical\ndepth and radial distance. Downflows are detected in the mid and outer penumbra, but only in deep layers (log \u03c4500 \u2264 \u22121.4).\nWe demonstrate that the velocity stratifications retrieved from the inversion are consistent with the idea of penumbral flux tubes\nchanneling the Evershed flow. Finally, we show that larger Evershed flows are associated with brighter continuum intensities\nin the inner center-side penumbra. Dark structures, however, are also associated with significant Evershed flows. This leads us\nto suggest that the bright and dark filaments seen at 0.\u2032\u2032 5 resolution are not individual flow channels, but a collection of them.\nOur analysis highlights the importance of very high spatial resolution spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric measurements for\na better understanding of sunspot penumbrae.\nKey words. Line: profiles \u2013 Sun: photosphere \u2013 Sun: sunspots\n\n1. Introduction\nThe fine structure of the penumbra is intimately connected\nto the Evershed flow, the most conspicuous dynamical phenomenon observed in sunspots (e.g., Solanki 2003; Thomas &\nWeiss 2004). Therefore, a proper observational characterization of this fine structure is essential to understand the Evershed\nflow and, more generally, the nature of the penumbra itself.\nStudying the fine structure of the penumbra is difficult because of the very small scales involved. Recent imaging observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (Scharmer\net al. 2003; Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2004) have revealed\nthat even at a resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 1 some of the filaments that form\nthe penumbra may be unresolved. That is, different structures\n(each having different properties) may coexist in the resolution element, and we are not able to separate them. A proper\n\u22c6\n\nOperated by the Association of Universities for Research in\nAstronomy, Inc. (AURA), for the National Science Foundation\n\ncharacterization of the penumbra calls not only for diffractionlimited imaging observations, but also for more quantitative\nspectroscopic and spectropolarimetric analyses at the highest\nresolution possible. By interpreting the shape of spectral lines\nwe can derive the thermal, magnetic, and kinematic configuration of the penumbra via the Zeeman and Doppler effects.\nUnfortunately, current spectroscopic observations do not attain\nresolutions better than \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 5, and this limit is often reached at\nthe cost of poor spectral resolution. The situation is even worse\nin the case of spectropolarimetric measurements: the best angular resolution of existing solar polarimeters is about 1\u2032\u2032 .\nThis paper is the third of a series devoted to the analysis of 2D spectroscopic observations of a sunspot. The\ndata were acquired with the TElecentric SOlar Spectrometer\n(TESOS; Kentischer et al. 1998; Tritschler et al. 2002) and\nthe Kiepenheuer Adaptive Optics System (KAOS; Soltau et\nal. 2002; von der L\u00fche et al. 2003) at the German Vacuum\nTower Telescope of Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife, Spain).\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\n2. Observations and data analysis\n\n2.1. Observations\nOn July 5, 2002, TESOS was used to measure the intensity profiles of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm in the main sunspot of NOAA AR 10019\n(cf. Paper I). At the time of the observations, the spot was located 23o off the disk center. The line was scanned at 100 wavelength points with a wavelength step of 8.4 pm, corresponding\nto overcritical spectral sampling. The time needed to complete\nthe scan was 37 s. Operated in high resolution mode, TESOS\nyielded a pixel size of 0.\u2032\u2032 089 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 089. During the scan, the\nKAOS system provided real-time correction of wavefront distortions due to turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Diagnostic capabilities of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm\nWe use the intensity profiles of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm to derive the\nstratification of temperature and velocity in the penumbra.\nTherefore, it is important to examine the properties of this line\nin some detail. Fe \uf769 557.6 nm is a fairly strong photospheric\nline with zero effective Land\u00e9 factor, i.e., it does not undergo\nany Zeeman splitting. The line is often quoted to be temperature insensitive, but this is too a simplistic statement. Figure 5\nof Paper I shows that the equivalent width of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm\nchanges by non-negligible amounts when going from the quiet\nsun to the umbra, where the temperatures are rather different.\nIn the following, we elaborate on the temperature sensitivity of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm by means of response functions (RFs;\nsee Ruiz Cobo & del Toro Iniesta 1994 and del Toro Iniesta\n2003). The upper panel of Fig. 1 shows the RF of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm\nto temperature perturbations as evaluated in the penumbral\nmodel atmosphere of del Toro Iniesta et al. (1994; hereafter\nTTR). This plot tells us how much the specific intensity at \u03bb\nchanges when the temperature of the model is increased by\n\ndI/dT [% K-1]\n\nlog \u03c4500\n\nThese observations combine high spectral (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 250 000)\nand spatial (0.\u2032\u2032 5) resolution (Tritschler et al. 2004; hereafter referred to as Paper I). In Paper II of this series (Schlichenmaier\net al. 2004), we investigated the properties of the Evershed flow\nthrough a bisector analysis of the observed intensity profiles.\nHere we perform a full inversion of the same data set in\norder to study the thermal and kinematic configuration of the\npenumbra. Our analysis allows us to explain a number of findings reported in Paper I and to remove some of the uncertainties\nassociated with the methods employed in Paper II. At the same\ntime, we gather new information on the thermal properties of\nthe penumbra. This is particularly important because very few\nthermal studies of sunspot penumbrae have been published\nto date (del Toro Iniesta et al. 1994; Balasubramaniam 2002;\nRouppe van der Voort 2002; S\u00e1nchez Cuberes et al. 2005).\nA brief account of the observations and details of the inversion procedure are given in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we discuss the\nmaps of physical quantities inferred from the inversion. The\nthermal and kinematic configuration of the penumbra is described in detail in Sects. 4 and 5. Some implications of the\nresults are presented in Sect. 6, and a summary of our findings\nis given in Sect. 7.\n\n1\n\n0.010\n\n0\n\n0.008\n\n-1\n\n0.006\n\n-2\n\n0.004\n\n-3\n\n0.002\n\n-4\n-0.04\n\n0.000\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\ndI/dvLOS [% (m/s)-1]\n1\n\n0.002\n\n0\nlog \u03c4500\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n-1\n\n0.000\n\n-2\n\n-0.001\n\n-3\n-0.002\n\n-4\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\u2206\u03bb [nm]\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFig. 1.

The thermal stratification of the penumbral model of TTR has been employed for\nthese calculations.\n\n1 K at a given optical depth \u03c4500 . The figure demonstrates that\nthe line reacts to temperature changes. The sensitivity of any\nspectral line to temperature perturbations is determined by two\ncompeting effects: changes in the absorption and in the emission. Usually, only opacity variations are considered (e.g., Gray\n1988, Chapter 13) but, as pointed out by Cabrera Solana et al.\n(2005), the dominant contribution is that of the source function.\nNeglect of this dominant factor is the likely cause of the line\nbeing quoted as temperature insensitive in most publications.\nFigure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the equivalent width for a set of neutral iron lines commonly used in\nsolar physics (adapted from Cabrera Solana et al. 2005). It is\napparent from this figure that Fe \uf769 557.6 nm is one of the most\ntemperature sensitive lines. Indeed, it shows a larger sensitivity\nthan lines presumed to be appropriate for temperature measurements such as Fe \uf769 524.7 and 525.0 nm. The large variation of\nthe equivalent width of Fe \uf769 557.6 nm with temperature is consistent with the observed behavior of the line in the quiet sun,\numbra and penumbra (Fig. 5 of Paper I).\nLet us now turn our attention to the sensitivity of Fe \uf769 557.6\nnm to line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. The bottom panel of Fig. 1\nshows the RF of the intensity to velocity perturbations as evaluated in the penumbral model of TTR.

The calculations have been carried out using the\nthermal stratification of the penumbral model of TTR.\nare symmetric about the line center (models in which the LOS\nvelocity varies with height would result in asymmetrical RFs\nand slightly different sensitivities in the different atmospheric\nlayers). As can be seen, the line is sensitive to velocities in a\nheight range from about log \u03c4500 = 0 to \u22123.5. The maximum\nsensitivity is attained in the mid photosphere. In the deep and\nhigh layers where the continuum and the line core are formed,\nrespectively, the sensitivity to velocities is much reduced. The\nreason has been explained by Cabrera Solana et al. (2005): at\na given wavelength, the intensity variation induced by Doppler\nshifts is proportional to the slope of the line at that position.\nThus, the intensity changes are maximum near the line wings\n(which sample the mid photosphere) and minimum near the\ncontinuum and the line core, where the slope of the intensity\nprofile (dI/d\u03bb) quickly goes to zero. The lower panel of Fig. 1\nalso demonstrates that the intensity observed at a fixed wavelength is sensitive to LOS velocities in a broad range of optical\ndepths. That is, the Doppler shifts measured from line bisectors\nat a given intensity level contain information from a significant\nfraction of the atmosphere. Thus, it is difficult to ascribe them\nto any particular layer. This limitation of bisector analyses has\nlong been recognized (Maltby 1964; Rimmele 1995).\n\n2.3. Inversion procedure\nThe intensity profiles observed with TESOS have been inverted\nin order to determine the stratification of temperature, LOS velocity, and microturbulence with optical depth. To this end,\nwe have used the SIR code (Ruiz Cobo & del Toro Iniesta\n1992). Despite the high spectral resolution of our observations,\nthe number of data points does not allow us to use complex\natmospheric models. Hence, we have adopted a simple onecomponent model with gradients of the physical parameters.\nWe derive the temperature stratification by modifying the\nthermal structure of the penumbral model of TTR with two\nnodes. For a better recovery of this parameter, the observed\nprofiles are normalized to the continuum intensity of the average quiet sun profile. Such an absolute normalization implies\nthat the continuum of the individual profiles carries information\n\n3\n\nabout the temperature in the deep atmospheric layers. The two\nnodes used to infer the thermal structure allow for changes in\nthe gradient and absolute position [e.g., T (\u03c4500 = 1)] of the initial temperature stratification. We assume local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). Since non-LTE effects may be important\nin the upper layers, our temperatures are reliable only up to,\nsay, log \u03c4500 \u223c \u22123. Electron pressures are computed from the\ninferred temperatures using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law.\nThe inversion also yields the stratification with depth of the\nLOS velocity and microturbulent velocity. In both cases we assume linear variations with log \u03c4500 , i.e., two nodes for each\nparameter. In the case of the LOS velocity, this choice seems\nto be appropriate considering that most observed bisectors possess quite linear shapes (Paper II). From the inversion we also\ndetermine the (height-independent) macroturbulence needed to\nreproduce the observed line widths. The synthetic profiles are\nconvolved with the instrumental profile of TESOS before being\ncompared with the observed ones. To describe the broadening\nof the line due to collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms we\nuse the quantum mechanical formulation of Anstee, Barklem,\n& O'Mara (see Barklem et al. 2000). The total number of free\nparameters is 7, which compares favorably with the number of\nobservables (100).\nWithout additional spectral lines observed, or measurements of the four Stokes parameters, it is not possible to estimate the amount of stray light contamination. We expect, however, that stray light arising from seeing fluctuations is much\nreduced with respect to earlier observations that did not benefit\nfrom adaptive optics. By contrast, parasitic light inside TESOS\nhas been corrected for. In Paper I we determined that \u223c 5% of\nthe mean continuum intensity contributes to each filtergram in\nthe form of ghosts and scattered light. This parasitic light has\nbeen subtracted from the individual images before extracting\nthe intensity profiles.\nOur inversion approach avoids important shortcomings of\nsimpler analyses. Since the complete radiative transfer problem is solved, we effectively separate the contribution of temperatures and LOS velocities to the observed profiles using the\ninformation provided by the RFs. From Fig. 1 it is clear that\nthe intensity at a fixed wavelength depends on the temperature\nand LOS velocity stratification along the atmosphere. Thus,\nwe determine both parameters simultaneously in order not to\nmisinterpret thermal effects as velocity effects and vice versa.\nAnother important improvement is that we can ascribe the inferred velocities and temperatures to specific optical depths, because our procedure takes into account the finite width of the\nintensity contribution functions.\nThe simple one-component model atmosphere used in this\ninvestigation has several limitations. First, it does not allow for\nany unresolved structure in the pixel. Although our spatial resolution is one of the highest ever reached in spectroscopic studies, we are still far from resolving the individual constituents of\nthe penumbra. Spectropolarimetric measurements suggest that\nat least two magnetic components are necessary to understand\nthe penumbra (Schlichenmaier & Collados 2002; Bellot Rubio\net al. 2003, 2004; Borrero et al. 2004, 2005). One of the two\ncomponents carries most of the Evershed flow, while the other\n\n\f4\n\nBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\nI/Ic_QS\n\nCenter-side penumbra\n\nLimb-side penumbra\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\u2206\u03bb [pm]\n\n20\n\n40\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\u2206\u03bb [pm]\n\n20\n\n40\n\nFig. 3.

The vertical dashed lines indicate the\nposition of zero velocities (see Paper I). Note the strong asymmetries of the line, with an extended blue wing in the centerside penumbra and an extended red wing in the limb-side\npenumbra.\nis essentially at rest. If the flow channels are horizontally unresolved and we do not account for this possibility, the LOS velocities determined from the inversion would represent lower\nlimits to the real velocities. Second, we have chosen a very\nsimple functional dependence to describe the run of the LOS\nvelocity with height. In an uncombed penumbra consisting of\npenumbral flux tubes embedded in a background magnetic atmosphere, lines of sight that pierce the tubes would 'see' discontinuities in the LOS velocity as they encounter the upper\nand lower boundaries of the tubes. Our assumption of linear velocity stratifications would provide only a very rough description of such discontinuous velocity stratifications. In that case,\nit would be the magnitude and sign of the LOS velocity gradient inferred from the inversion which would inform us about\nthe velocity inside the flux tubes and the height position of the\nflow channels.\nDespite these shortcomings, the adopted model atmosphere\ndoes an excellent job in explaining the observed intensity profiles. On average, the residuals of the fit are only slightly larger\nthan the noise (after 2 \u00d7 2 binning, the observed profiles have a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of about 120 in the continuum intensity).\nFigure 3 shows examples of profiles recorded in the center- and\nlimb-side penumbra, along with the best-fit profiles resulting\nfrom the inversion. The very asymmetrical shapes induced by\nthe photospheric Evershed flow are successfully reproduced,\nindicating that the assumption of linear LOS velocity stratifications suffices to explain the observed Doppler shifts and line bisectors. This is true for all profiles showing linear bisectors. In\nthe very outer penumbra, bisector kinks and reversals are common (Paper II). We cannot reproduce these profiles so well. In\nthese cases, it seems that more complex LOS velocity stratifications than the one used here would apply.\n\n3. Results\nThe filtergrams have been binned by a factor of 2 before extracting the intensity profiles. This increases the pixel size to\n\n0.\u2032\u2032 18 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 18, which is still sufficient to sample our seeinglimited spatial resolution of about 0.\u2032\u2032 5. After binning, we are\nleft with 37 000 individual profiles which are inverted independently. The inversion has been performed using a parallelized\nversion of SIR in a 16-processor Linux Beowulf cluster. The\ninversion of the data cube is accomplished in about 2.5 hours.\nFigure 4 displays maps of the temperature and LOS velocity at two representative optical depths in the atmosphere\n(log \u03c4500 = 0 and \u22122). The fine structure of the penumbra is\napparent (both in temperature and velocity) in the deep photosphere, where hot penumbral filaments and flow filaments are\nseen to extend from the inner to the outer penumbral boundary.\nThe fluctuations in temperature and LOS velocity are much reduced at log \u03c4500 = \u22122; indeed, no fine-scale organization of\nthe penumbra is obvious at this optical depth. Consequently,\nthe physical mechanisms producing the filaments must operate\npreferentially in the deep layers.\nThe right panels of Fig. 4 show maps of the microturbulence at log \u03c4500 = 0 and the macroturbulent velocity.\nAccording to our results, no microturbulence is needed in either\nthe umbra or the inner penumbra. This is in contrast to the outer\npenumbra, where microturbulent velocities of 1.8\u20132 km s\u22121 are\ncommon. Thus, the smaller line widths observed in the inner\npenumbra (Fig. 5 of Paper I) can be interpreted as being due\nto a reduced microturbulence. Note that the map of microturbulence shows fine structure in the mid penumbra. Also important is the fact that microturbulence decreases with height, until\nzero values are reached in the high layers (see Sect. 5.3). Again,\nthis is consistent with the idea that the mechanisms enhancing\nthe line width operate preferentially in deep atmospheric layers. The macroturbulence stays relatively constant across the\npenumbra, with values of 1\u20131.2 km s\u22121 . Only in the very inner penumbra and the umbra is the macroturbulence reduced,\nperhaps as a consequence of their stronger magnetic fields.\nIn the next sections, we describe in more detail the thermal\nand kinematic configuration of the penumbra as deduced from\nthe inversion.\n\n4. Thermal structure\nFirst, let us examine the reliability of the inferred temperatures.\nFigure 5a shows the temperature at \u03c4557.6 = cos \u03b8 = 0.92 returned by the inversion code versus the observed continuum\nintensities. The scatter of the points is small, indicating an excellent correlation between the two quantities. The fact that we\nuse an absolute normalization for the observed profiles is one\nof the main reasons why the inversion code is able to determine\nthe temperature of the continuum-forming layers so accurately.\nThe solid line in Fig. 5a represents the temperatures obtained from the Eddington-Barbier approximation I\u03bb (\u03b8) =\nS \u03bb (\u03c4\u03bb = cos \u03b8), where I\u03bb (\u03b8) is the specific intensity observed\nat an heliocentric angle \u03b8, S \u03bb is the source function (assumed\nto be the Planck function), and \u03c4\u03bb is the continuum optical\ndepth at the wavelength of the observation. As can be seen,\nthe Eddington-Barbier approximation yields the same temperatures as those deduced from the inversion. Only for small continuum intensities are the inferred temperatures slightly larger\nthan those indicated by the Eddington-Barbier relation, but\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\nTemperature at log \u03c4500 = 0 [K]\n5800\n\n6000\n\n6200\n\nLOS velocity at log \u03c4500 = 0 [km s-1]\n6400\n\n-2\n\nTemperature at log \u03c4500 = -2 [K]\n4200\n\n4400\n\n4600\n\n4800\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nMicroturbulence at log \u03c4500=0 [km s-1]\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nLOS velocity at log \u03c4500 = -2 [km s-1]\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nMacroturbulence [km s-1]\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFig. 4.

Negative LOS velocities indicate redshifts. The lower right panel displays the\nmacroturbulent velocity, assumed to be height independent. Contours outline the inner and outer penumbral boundaries.\noverall the agreement is very satisfactory. This implies that the\nobserved continuum intensities can be reliably used to estimate\ntemperatures in deep photospheric layers. A similar conclusion\nhas been reached by TTR and Rouppe van der Voort (2002).\nIn the line wing, the one-to-one correspondence between\nspecific intensity and temperature found before does not hold\nany longer. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5b, where we plot the\ntemperatures resulting from the inversion at log \u03c4500 = \u22121.3\nversus the intensities observed at \u22125.2 pm from line center. We\nuse log \u03c4500 = \u22121.3 because this is the optical depth of the\ncentroid of the contribution function for the line depression at\n\u2206\u03bb = \u22125.2 pm, evaluated in the mean penumbral model atmosphere. It is immediately apparent from the figure that the same\nline wing intensity can be associated with a wide range of temperatures (up to about 500 K). Thus, line wing intensities cannot be employed to infer temperatures directly. The reason is\nthat the intensities critically depend on the line asymmetries in-\n\nduced by the Evershed flow and on the line width variations due\nto microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities. All these factors contribute to the large scatter of the points seen in Fig. 5b.\nThe problem has been recognized by Balasubramaniam (2002).\nIn an attempt to cure it, Balasubramaniam introduced the concept of flowless maps, i.e., intensity maps constructed by removing the global Doppler shift of the lines emerging from\neach individual pixel. Unfortunately, flowless maps are still affected by the line asymmetries caused by the Evershed flow.\nLet us now investigate the radial variation of the temperature at different optical depths. To this end, we have computed\nazimuthally averaged temperatures along elliptical paths centered on the spot (cf. Fig. 6 of Paper I). The average temperatures are plotted in Fig. 6 for four optical depths. At all heights\nin the atmosphere, the temperature is observed to increase radially from the sunspot center to the outer penumbral boundary.\nThis increase is rather linear except for an obvious hump in the\n\n\f6\n\nBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\n6.5\n\nlog \u03c4500 = 0\nlog \u03c4500 = -1\nlog \u03c4500 = -2\nlog \u03c4500 = -3\n\nTemperature [kK]\n\n6.0\n5.5\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNormalized radial distance\n\nFig. 6.

The amplitude of the hump decreases\nas one moves towards the upper photospheric layers. In deep\nlayers (log \u03c4500 = 0), the hump is so pronounced that the radial variation of the temperature is almost flat between 0.6 and\n0.9 penumbral radii (i.e., the mid penumbra and most of the\nouter penumbra). We also note that the hump is located increasingly closer to the umbra/penumbra boundary as the upper layers are approached. These temperature enhancements could be\ndue to the presence of hot penumbral tubes, as suggested by\nthe numerical simulations of Schlichenmaier et al. (1998). The\nhot tubes would be more easily detected in the inner penumbra because the plasma emerging from subphotospheric layers\nquickly cools off by radiation away from the tube's inner footpoint (Schlichenmaier et al. 1999). If the humps exhibited by\nthe temperature curves of Fig. 6 are indeed produced by hot\nflux tubes, then it is clear that they must be located preferentially in the lower layers.\nThe mean temperature stratification of the penumbra considering all pixels is shown in Fig. 7a. For comparison, we\nalso plot the mean temperature stratification obtained by TTR.\nThe two curves have the same curvature at all heights, but are\n\nTemperature [kK]\n\n7\n\n(b) CS and LS temperatures\n\nThis work\nTTR - 200 K\n\n7\n\n6\n\nCenter side\nLimb side\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n4\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\nlog \u03c4500\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\nlog \u03c4500\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nFig. 7.

In\naddition, the two data sets may be affected by different levels\nof stray light contamination.\nIn Fig. 7b we plot the average temperature stratifications\nfor the center-side and limb-side penumbra. Again, the curvature of the two stratifications is very similar, but the limb-side\npenumbra is observed to be cooler than the center-side penumbra at all heights. The difference is larger in the upper layers (up\nto 150 K). A similar asymmetry has been reported by Rouppe\nvan der Voort (2002) from an analysis of Ca \uf769\uf769 K observations.\nRouppe van der Voort suggests that the larger average temperature of the center-side penumbra is produced by an excess of\nbright structures in the outer center-side penumbra. Our results\nsupport this idea.

The inner penumbra does not\nshow significant differences between the two sides of the spot.\nPixels in the outer penumbra, by contrast, are generally hotter\non the center side.\nThe fact that both sides of the penumbra show different\ntemperatures might be related to the different viewing angle.\nRouppe van der Voort (2002) suggests that the higher temperatures of the outer center-side penumbra can be explained\nby isotherms being tilted downwards away from the umbra.\nThe required tilt is opposite to what one would expect from\nthe Wilson depression (inclined upwards away from the umbra, e.g., Mathew et al. 2004), but it may be real: it has been\ndemonstrated that penumbral flux tubes dive down below the\nsolar surface in the mid penumbra and beyond (Westendorp\nPlaza et al. 1997, 2001; Bellot Rubio et al. 2004; Borrero et al.\n2004). That is, the field lines are slightly inclined downwards in\nthe outer penumbra. Perhaps this configuration of the magnetic\nfield is capable of determining the inclination of the isotherms,\nalthough the exact mechanism has not been identified yet.\nAs pointed out by Rouppe van der Voort (2002), other authors also find that the center-side penumbra is generally hotter\nthan the limb-side penumbra (e.g., TTR; Westendorp Plaza et\nal. 2001). To the best of our knowledge, only one discrepant\nanalysis exists.

Clearly, more\nobservations are required to settle the issue.\nTaking advantage of the high spatial resolution of our\ndataset, we conclude this section with a discussion of the\ntemperature fluctuations observed at different optical depths.\nFigure 9 displays such fluctuations along an azimuthal path\ncrossing the penumbra at a normalized radial distance of 0.8,\nfor log \u03c4500 = 0, \u22121, and \u22122. The fluctuations become smaller\nand smaller as the upper layers are approached. At log \u03c4500 = 0,\nthe temperature fluctuates by some 200 K, while at log \u03c4500 =\n\u22122 the fluctuations are smaller than 50\u2013100 K. The vertical\nlines mark a few positions where the temperature is enhanced\nlocally. Clearly, hot structures in the deep layers remain hot\nin the upper layers, but with lower temperature contrasts. This\nis in excellent agreement with the findings of Rouppe van der\nVoort (2002) and Bello Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005). Our results suggest that the structures giving rise to the bright penumbral filaments seen in white-light images (probably flux tubes) are located mainly in the lower photosphere. The small temperature\nfluctuations observed in high layers do not necessarily imply\nthat flux tubes are present there: if the deep-lying tubes are hot,\nit is very likely that they can heat the layers above them.

Kinematic structure\nWe start this section by examining how well the bisector velocities of Papers I and II compare with the velocities inferred from\nthe inversion. Such a comparison is important to strengthen the\nconclusions drawn in Paper II from the analysis of the observed\nbisectors. Figure 10 shows scatter plots of the LOS velocities\ndeduced from the two different methods. As can be seen, the\nagreement is very satisfactory in both deep and high layers.\nBisector velocities near the continuum (intensity levels 60%\u2013\n80%) are well correlated with the LOS velocities determined\nat log \u03c4500 = \u22120.6, with an rms difference of only 55 m s\u22121 .\nBisector velocities near the line core (intensity levels 2%\u201320%)\nare also well correlated with the LOS velocities returned by the\ninversion at log \u03c4500 \u223c \u22121.8, the rms difference being about\n70 m s\u22121 . We have chosen the optical depths that yield the best\nagreement, but it should be remarked that they coincide almost\nexactly with the centroids of the RFs to velocity perturbations,\nevaluated in the average penumbral model atmosphere. The\ncentroids are located at log \u03c4500 \u223c \u22120.8 and \u223c \u22121.6 for intensity levels of 60%\u201380% and 2%\u201320%, respectively. The agreement is not surprising: Ruiz Cobo & del Toro Iniesta (1994)\nand S\u00e1nchez Almeida et al. (1996) have shown that physical\nparameters measured from spectral lines using simple techniques (e.g., Doppler shifts from line bisectors) are an average\nof the actual stratification of the parameter weighted by the corresponding RF. If the stratification is linear with depth, then the\nheight of formation of the measured parameter is the barycenter\nof the RF (del Toro Iniesta 2003, Chapter 10).\nFigure 10 demonstrates that Doppler velocities derived\nfrom bisectors near the line core should be ascribed to layers\nsignificantly deeper than the 'formation height' of the line core.\nThis is because of the very large widths of the RFs of I to vLOS .\nSuch widths imply that a wide range of layers contribute to the\nobserved Doppler shift. As shown in Fig. 1, the line core reacts\nonly little to mass motions in the upper photosphere, and so\nvelocities there are difficult to detect unless the contribution of\ndeeper layers is properly considered.\n\nIn Fig. 11 we show the azimuthally averaged LOS velocity at\nfour optical depths as a function of normalized radial distance.\nWe consider separately the limb-side and center-side penumbra (left and right upper panels, respectively). The curves depicted in Fig. 11 confirm in a more quantitative way the impression from Fig. 4 that the Evershed flow strongly decreases with\nheight. A velocity reversal is observed around log \u03c4500 = \u22122.\nOn the limb side, we infer redshifts in the deep photosphere\nand blueshifts in the upper layers. For most of the center-side\npenumbra, blueshifts in deep layers and redshifts in high layers\nare retrieved (an exception is the very outer part of the centerside penumbra). Interestingly, the LOS velocity stratifications\ndisplayed in Fig. 4 of TTR also feature sign reversals around\nlog \u03c4500 = \u22122. A possible explanation for the sign reversal is\noffered in Sect. 6.2.\nThe lower panels of Fig. 11 show the average velocity stratifications at two radial distances: r = 0.6R and r = 0.97R. On\nthe limb side, the gradient of vLOS with log \u03c4500 is significantly\nlarger in the outer penumbra. On the center side, the situation is\nreversed, with slightly larger gradients in the inner penumbra.\nThese gradients reproduce the slopes of the observed bisectors\nin the different parts of the penumbra (Fig. 1 of Paper II). Note\nthe occurrence of negative velocities (blueshifts) in the upper\nlayers except in the inner center-side penumbra, where positive velocities are retrieved above log \u03c4500 = \u22122. The inferred\nvelocity stratifications, together with the various broadening\nand smearing mechanisms, explain the line-core blueshifts observed almost everywhere in the penumbra, as well as the small\nline-core redshifts detected in the inner center-side penumbra\n(e.g., bisectors #33 and #34 in Paper II). At this point it is important to remark that the line-core blueshifts cannot be produced by the inverse Evershed flow. According to Georgakilas\net al. (2003, his Fig. 6), the speed and angle with respect to the\nlocal vertical of the inverse Evershed flow are \u223c 0.5 km s\u22121 and\n100o in the inner penumbra, at the height where the intensity\nobserved at 0.5 \u00c5 from the center of the H\u03b1 line is formed.\nThe flow speed and the flow angle near the outer penumbral\nboundary are \u223c 4.5 km s\u22121 and 115o , respectively. With these\nflow configurations and the heliocentric angle of our observations, the inverse Evershed effect would produce non-negligible\nDoppler shifts only in the outer center-side penumbra, where it\nwould show up as a redshift, not as a blueshift.\n\n5.2. Flow geometry at different heights\nWe have computed the flow speed and flow angle at different\noptical depths from the azimuthal variation of the LOS velocities returned by the inversion code. The calculations have been\nperformed as explained in Sect. 5.4 of Paper I. If one assumes\nthat the flow field is axially symmetric, the azimuthally averaged LOS velocity reflects the vertical flow component, and\nthe amplitude of the azimuthal variation of the LOS velocity reflects the horizontal flow component. Using these components,\nthe mean flow inclination and the absolute flow velocity can be\ndeduced. The results of the analysis are presented in Fig. 12 as\na function of normalized radial distance.\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\nLimb-side penumbra\n2.0\n\nLOS velocity [km s-1]\n\nCenter-side penumbra\n1.0\n\nlog \u03c4500 = 0\nlog \u03c4500 = -1\nlog \u03c4500 = -2\nlog \u03c4500 = -3\n\n1.5\n\n9\n\nlog \u03c4500 = 0\nlog \u03c4500 = -1\nlog \u03c4500 = -2\nlog \u03c4500 = -3\n\n0.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-0.5\n-1.0\n0.0\n\n-1.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNormalized radial distance\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNormalized radial distance\n\nLOS velocity [km/s]\n\nLimb-side penumbra\n1.5\n\nCenter-side penumbra\n\nr/R = 0.60\nr/R = 0.97\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n-4\n\n-3\n\nr/R = 0.60\nr/R = 0.97\n\n-2\n\nlog \u03c4500\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-1.0\n-4\n\n1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nlog \u03c4500\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFig. 11.

Bottom: Average LOS velocity stratifications\nin the limb-side penumbra (left) and center-side penumbra (right) at r = 0.6R and r = 0.97R.\nAs mentioned in Sect. 2.3, our simple model atmosphere\ndoes not account for the possibility of unresolved structure in\nthe resolution element. Thus, the flow speeds resulting from the\ncalculations are probably smaller than the real ones1 . To first\norder, however, the flow angles are not influenced by this effect,\nbecause they are derived from the ratio of the horizontal and\nvertical components of the flow, and both are affected equally\nby the lack of spatial resolution.\nFrom Fig. 12 we note the following features:\n1. The flow inclination (with respect to the local vertical) increases with optical depth. Downflows are present in the\nmid and outer penumbra, but only in deep layers. In high\nlayers, the flow is always inclined upward.\n2. The flow velocity decreases with decreasing optical depth.\n3. The radial position of maximum flow velocity and maximum flow inclination 'migrate' outwards as we go to higher\natmospheric layers.\n1\n\nFollowing Bellot Rubio (2004), we may assume for simplicity that\nat a given radial distance the flow channels occupy a fraction 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264\n1 of the resolution element, the remaining (1 \u2212 \u03b1) being plasma at\nrest.

This strengthens the conclusions of Paper II, where we inferred a similar\nflow configuration from the interpretation of individual bisector shapes. It is important to remark that calculations using the\nbisector velocities derived in Paper II lead to the very same\nflow angles and flow speeds (cf. Fig. 6 in Bellot Rubio 2004),\nas could have been expected from Fig. 10.\nThe results presented in Fig. 12 are in good agreement with\nthe flow inclinations determined by Bellot Rubio et al. (2003,\n2004) from a two-component inversion of infrared Stokes profiles. The radial variation of the flow angle described by Bellot\nRubio et al. corresponds roughly to our curve for log \u03c4500 = 0,\nbecause the Fe \uf769 1565 nm lines they use are sensitive to velocities in very deep and narrow photospheric layers. Our results\nare also consistent with those of S\u00e1nchez Cuberes et al. (2005),\nwho inverted spectropolarimetric measurements of a sunspot at\ndisk center in terms of one-component model atmospheres with\ngradients of velocity. These authors found that downflows occur predominantly in deep layers (log \u03c4500 < \u22121), disappearing\nhigher up in the atmosphere. The present analysis, however,\ndoes not confirm the small downflows retrieved by S\u00e1nchez\nCuberes et al. (2005) in the inner penumbra.\n\n2.0\nMicroturbulence [km s-1]\n\n10\n\nlog \u03c4500 = 0\nlog \u03c4500 = -1\nlog \u03c4500 = -2\nlog \u03c4500 = -3\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNormalized radial distance\n\nFig. 13.

Microturbulence\nFor each pixel the inversion returns the height variation of the\nmicroturbulence, assumed to be linear with log \u03c4500 . Figure 13\nshows the azimuthally averaged microturbulence at four optical\ndepths versus normalized radial distance. From this figure it is\napparent that:\n1. In the inner penumbra, up to about 0.6 penumbral radii, the\nmicroturbulence is zero at all heights.\n2. In the mid and outer penumbra, the microturbulence is different from zero and increases with optical depth and radial\ndistance.\n3. The gradient with depth of the microturbulence increases\nwith increasing radial distance.\nIn Paper I (Fig. 7) we determined the radial dependence of\nthe azimuthally averaged equivalent width (EW) and the full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity profiles observed in NOAA 10019. For both parameters we found minima\nin the inner penumbra (r \u223c 0.65R) and maxima in the outer\npenumbra (r \u223c 0.95R). According to the present results, this\nradial increase of the EW and the FWHM is due to a microturbulence that increases radially (item 2 above).\nWhat is the origin of the microturbulent velocities returned by the inversion code? One can speculate that stronger\nEvershed flows result in increased shear at the boundary layer\nseparating the flow channels from the surrounding (static) magnetic atmosphere. Strong shears may produce small-scale turbulence through the onset of instabilities. This would explain\nwhy we detect enhanced microturbulence in the mid and outer\npenumbra, where the flow speeds are larger.\nHowever, we also found in Paper I that both the EW and\nthe FWHM tend to be slightly enhanced in the regions of maximum Doppler shifts (i.e., along the line connecting the disk\ncenter and the sunspot center). A similar tendency is observed\n\nFig. 14. LOS velocities determined from the inversion at\nlog \u03c4500 = \u22121.5 versus the microturbulence at the same optical depth. The vertical dotted lines indicate LOS velocities of\n\u00b10.4 km s\u22121 . Larger velocities are always associated with enhanced microturbulence. The same correlation is seen in deeper\nlayers, but less clearly.\n\nfor the microturbulence. Figure 14 shows the microturbulence\ndetermined from the inversion at log \u03c4500 = \u22121.5 versus the\nLOS velocity at the same optical depth. From this figure, it\nis clear that large LOS velocities are always associated with\nlarge microturbulences. The findings of Paper I led us to conjecture that the increase in the EW and the FWHM associated\nwith large velocities may be due to the presence of strongly\nDoppler-shifted (but spectrally unresolved) line satellites. This\nsuggests that part of the microturbulence we infer may not represent real small-scale turbulence, but a convenient means to\naccount for the effects of line satellites.\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\n11\n\n6. Discussion\n\nCenter-side profiles\n0.8\n\n6.1. Origin of enhanced line-wing intensities in the\ninner penumbra\n\n0.7\n\nI/Ic,QS\n\n0.6\n\nFrom an analysis of the Stokes profiles of the Fe \uf769 1564.8 nm\nline, Bellot Rubio (2003) found that the intensity emerging\nfrom the inner penumbra is higher than that emerging from the\nouter penumbra at wavelengths close to, but not exactly at, the\nline center. That is, sunspots exhibit a bright ring in the inner penumbra when observed in the wing of spectral lines. The\nbright ring can be interpreted as a temperature enhancement in\nthe mid-photospheric layers (as it is detected in the wings of\nthe line but not in the continuum or line core).\nOur high spatial resolution observations of NOAA 10019\nconfirm this behavior (Fig. 8 of Paper I) and at the same time\nadd new information on it: the intensity enhancement occurs\nin the form of radial, narrow fibrils very similar to the bright\npenumbral filaments seen in continuum images, but with much\nhigher contrast (Fig. 3 of Paper I). Moreover, the enhancement\nis observed preferentially in the inner center-side penumbra\nblueward of the line core, and in the inner limb-side penumbra redward of the line core. The temperature stratifications\nof Fig. 6 indicate that the inner penumbra is always cooler\nthan the outer penumbra at all heights in the atmosphere, so\nthe enhanced brightness cannot be due to a temperature effect.\nHeating of the mid photosphere was the mechanism originally\nproposed by Bellot Rubio (2003). It is also the scenario favored\nby S\u00e1nchez Cuberes et al. (2005).\nHere we argue that the bright ring is actually produced by\n(a) the small Doppler shifts and line asymmetries observed\nin the inner penumbra, together with (b) the increase of the\nline width toward the outer sunspot boundary. The left panel\nof Fig. 15 shows an intensity map of the spot at \u2206\u03bb = \u22126.4\npm from line center (filtergram #42 in Fig. 3 of Paper I). The\nenhanced brightness of the inner center-side penumbra is apparent in this image. The intensity profiles emerging from the\ntwo spatial positions marked with crosses are displayed in the\nright panel of Fig. 15. As can be seen, these profiles possess\nvery different properties: in the outer penumbra (solid line)\nthey are broader and have a stronger asymmetry than in the\ninner penumbra (dashed line). The bright ring results from a\ncomparison of the intensities of pixels belonging to the inner\nand outer penumbra at fixed wavelengths (dotted vertical lines).\nConsider, for example, wavelengths in the blue wing (leftmost\nvertical line). At this wavelength, the inner penumbra is clearly\nbrighter than the outer penumbra. In the red wing (rightmost\nvertical line), the inner penumbra would still be brighter, but\nwith a much reduced contrast. This is consistent with the observations described in Paper I. Similar arguments apply to profiles emerging from the limb-side penumbra: because of the\nsmaller line widths and asymmetries in the inner penumbra, the\nintensity at fixed wavelengths is enhanced relative to the outer\npenumbra, with higher contrasts redward of the line core.\nThus, the bright ring can be explained satisfactorily in\nterms of the radial variation of the microturbulence and the\nEvershed flow. Microturbulence is an important parameter: if it\nwere the same everywhere across the spot, redward of the line\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n-30\n\nOuter PU\nInner PU\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n10\n\u2206\u03bb [pm]\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFig. 15.

The vertical dotted lines mark fixed\nwavelength positions in the blue wing, the line core, and the\nred wing (from left to right). The blue and red wing positions\ncorrespond to filtergrams #42 and #58 of Fig. 3 in Paper I.\n\nFig. 16. Maps of temperature at log \u03c4500 = 0 (left) and\nlog \u03c4500 = \u22121 (right) resulting from an inversion of the observed profiles in which only constant velocities along the LOS\nare permitted.\ncore the inner penumbra would appear darker than the outer\npenumbra on the center side, contradicting the observations.\nTo further support the idea that the bright ring is not due to\ntemperature enhancements, we have carried out the same inversions by forcing the LOS velocity to be constant with height\n(i.e., we do not allow for line asymmetries). In addition, we set\nthe microturbulence to zero. The thermal stratification resulting\nfrom these inversions is shown in Fig. 16 at log \u03c4500 = 0 and\n\u22121. While the temperature in the deep layers is essentially unchanged, the map of temperature at log \u03c4500 = \u22121 shows a nice\nbright ring in the inner penumbra. From this we conclude that\nthe only way to explain the enhanced line-wing intensities of\nthe inner penumbra when no line asymmetries are considered\nis by an increase of the temperature in the mid photosphere.\nUsing flowless maps, Balasubramaniam (2002) detected\nbright structures in the inner penumbra at wavelengths close to\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\nline center (his Fig. 8). Transforming observed intensities into\nradiation temperatures, he concluded that these structures are\nhotter than their surroundings. In our opinion, however, they\nmore likely trace regions of reduced Evershed flows and smallscale turbulence.\n\n6.2. Interpretation of the LOS velocity stratifications\n\nCenter side: inner PU\n\nLimb side: inner PU\nLOS velocity [km/s]\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-5\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2 -1\nlog \u03c4500\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-4\n\nLimb side: outer PU\nLOS velocity [km/s]\n\nIn Paper II we demonstrated that the uncombed model proposed by Solanki & Montavon (1993) is able to explain the\nbisector shapes observed in the penumbra of NOAA 10019. In\nan uncombed penumbra, the Evershed flow occurs along flux\ntubes whose magnetic fields are more horizontal than that of\ntheir surroundings. Here we use this model to interpret the LOS\nvelocity stratifications displayed in Fig. 11.\nAs pointed out in Sect. 2.3, it is the magnitude and slope\nof the inferred velocity stratification which inform us about the\nflow geometry (flow speed and flow angle) and height of the\nEvershed channels. Figure 5 of Paper II shows that, in the very\nouter penumbra, two flow channels stacked along the LOS and\nwith different inclination angles are necessary to understand\nthe kinks and reversals of the observed bisectors. In the inner\nand mid penumbra the bisectors are rather linear, and can be\nexplained in terms of a single, deep-lying flow channel.\nBased on these results, in the inner penumbra (r = 0.6R)\nwe consider a flow channel located in deep layers, between\nlog \u03c4500 = \u22120.7 and 0. The flow has a speed of 8 km s\u22121 and\nan inclination of 87\u25e6 with respect to the vertical. In the outer\npenumbra (r = 0.97R), we assume two flow channels located\nin deep and mid photospheric layers. The deep-lying channel\nextends from log \u03c4500 = \u22120.2 to 0.5. It has a flow speed of 8\nkm s\u22121 and an inclination of 135\u25e6 . The upper channel extends\nfrom log \u03c4500 = \u22121.8 to \u22121.1 and is assumed to have a flow\nspeed of 7 km s\u22121 and an inclination of 85\u25e6 . This flow configuration is similar to the one deduced in Paper II, except for the\nfact that our higher-lying channel is slightly inclined upward\ninstead of being horizontal. The LOS velocities resulting from\nthe two flux-tube geometries at the heliocentric angle of our\nobservations (\u03b8 = 23\u25e6 ) are represented by solid lines in Fig. 17,\nfor the center and limb-side penumbra.\nTo investigate whether or not these flow configurations can\nexplain the LOS velocities retrieved from the inversion, we\nhave computed synthetic profiles under the assumption that\nthe resolution element contains two different atmospheres. The\ntemperature and pressure stratifications of both atmospheres\nare taken to be the mean stratifications deduced from the inversion of NOAA 10019. The LOS velocity is set to zero in\nthe first component, whereas for the second component we use\nthe stratifications of Fig. 17. In the inner penumbra we adopt\na filling factor of 0.2, i.e., only 20% of the resolution element\nis occupied by flows. In the outer penumbra the filling factor\nis 0.5, as in Paper II. The resulting profiles are convolved with\nthe instrumental profile of TESOS and a macroturbulent velocity of 2 km s\u22121 (inner penumbra) or 1 km s\u22121 (outer penumbra).\nFinally, they are inverted under the same conditions as the real\ndata (two nodes for velocity, temperature and microturbulence,\nand a height-independent macroturbulence).

See text for details on the flux-tube\ngeometries adopted in the inner and outer penumbra.\n\nthe simulated profiles show the same bisector shapes and bisector variations across the penumbra as the real observations.\nThe linear velocity stratifications retrieved from the inversion of the simulated profiles are represented by dashed lines\nin Fig. 17. The first thing to notice is that the inferred stratifications change sign in the mid photosphere (around log \u03c4500 =\n\u22122) both on the center and limb sides, even though there are\nno structures in high layers that could be responsible for such\nvelocity reversals. Actually, the sign reversal is the result of extrapolating the jump(s) of velocity sensed by the LOS to the upper layers, where the response of the line to plasma motions is\nsmall. This extrapolation effect was first described by Mart\u0131\u0301nez\nPillet (2000) in connection with inversions of Stokes profiles\nof visible lines that do not explicitly account for the existence\nof penumbral flux tubes. The same effect has been observed\nby Mathew et al. (2003) in their one-component inversions of\nnear-infrared lines.\nThe second thing to note is that the azimuthally averaged\nLOS velocities inferred from the inversion of NOAA 10019\n(Fig. 11) are in excellent accord with the linear velocity stratifications resulting from the flux tube configurations displayed\nin Fig. 17. Specific features that are well reproduced include\nthe following:\n\u2013 On the limb side, the slope of the stratifications is larger in\nthe outer penumbra as compared with the inner penumbra,\nwhereas on the center side it is slightly larger in the inner\npenumbra.\n\u2013 The slope of the stratifications in the inner penumbra is\nlarger on the center side.\n\n\fBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\n13\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n\u2206Ic\n\ny [arcsec]\n\n15\n\n0.0\n10\n\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\n5\n\n-1.5\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nx [arcsec]\n\n15\n\n20\n\nvLOS (log \u03c4500=0)\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n280\nAzimuthal angle [deg]\n\n300\n\nFig. 18. Continuum intensity fluctuations (solid) and LOS velocity at log \u03c4500 = 0 (dashed) along an azimuthal path crossing the\ninner center-side penumbra as indicated on the left image. Negative velocities represent blueshifts. The vertical dotted lines mark\npositions of local maxima of the continuum intensity.\n\u2013 The LOS velocities corresponding to the outer center-side\npenumbra are negative all along the atmosphere.\nFrom this we conclude that the presence of flux tubes in the\npenumbra can explain the observed LOS velocity stratifications. In particular, the seemingly weird run with depth of the\nLOS velocity in the center-side penumbra at normalized radial distances larger than 0.9 (with zero or small redshifts at\nlog \u03c4500 = 0 and blueshifts increasing with height, see Fig. 11)\ncan be understood in terms of two flux tubes stacked along the\nLOS. The tube lying deeper contributes with positive velocity (i.e., a redshift). This redshift is necessary to explain the\nbisector reversals described in Paper II. In order to produce a\nredshift in the center-side penumbra, the deep-lying flux tube\nmust be inclined downward with respect to the horizontal by\nmore than 23o (the heliocentric angle of the spot), otherwise it\nwould show negative velocities and the slope of the resulting\nLOS velocity stratification would be opposite to what we observe. Flux tubes returning to the solar surface have previously\nbeen inferred by, among others, Westendorp Plaza et al. (1997,\n2001), Schlichenmaier & Schmidt (2000), Bellot Rubio et al.\n(2003, 2004) and Borrero et al. (2004, 2005).\nThe tube located higher in the atmosphere may be horizontal (as in Paper II) or slightly inclined upwards (less than 23\u25e6\nfrom the horizontal). The later configuration would still produce redshifts on the limb side and blueshifts on the center side,\nexactly what is required to explain the velocity stratifications\nobserved in the penumbra. Interestingly, such high-lying tubes\ndo not seem to be necessary in the inner penumbra, only in the\nmid and outer penumbra. It is tempting to associate them with\nthose described by Westendorp Plaza et al. (2001) and Bellot\nRubio et al. (2004). These authors found indications of a new\nfamily of penumbral tubes in the mid penumbra and beyond.\nSpectropolarimetric measurements suggest that such tubes are\nmore vertically oriented than the deeper ones, carrying a fraction of the Evershed flow to the upper photosphere.\n\n6.3. Do we see individual flow channels?\nContinuum intensity fluctuations and LOS velocities are very\nwell correlated in the inner penumbra. This is shown in Fig. 18,\nwhere we plot normalized continuum intensity variations and\nLOS velocities at log \u03c4500 = 0 along an azimuthal path crossing\n\n8 distinct continuum filaments of the inner center-side penumbra (we do not consider the limb-side part of the azimuthal path\nbecause no clear filaments are observed on the limb side). The\ncurves depicted in Fig. 18 reveal that larger continuum intensities are associated with larger LOS velocities, i.e., the Evershed\nflow is more intense in the brighter structures, at least in the inner center-side penumbra. This agrees with the conclusions of\nBello Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) and Schlichenmaier et al. (2005).\nHowever, the most important fact demonstrated by Fig. 18\nis that also the dark structures show large LOS velocities. Stray\nlight from the bright filaments may change the line profile in\nthe dark structures, but only to some extent (cf. Sect. 3.2 in\nPaper I). Unless the stray light contamination is unreasonably\nlarge, the velocities found in the dark filaments must be real.\nThis means that we see the Evershed flow everywhere: even at\na resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 5, there is almost no position in the penumbra\nwhere the velocity drops to zero (except where it must be zero\nfor geometrical reasons). In our opinion, this well established\nfact (see also Hirzberger & Kneer 2001 and Rouppe van der\nVoort 2002) has not been emphasized adequately in the past.\nSince Evershed flows are ubiquitous, it is tempting to think\nthat the bright and dark structures observed in continuum images are individual flow channels (i.e., isolated flux tubes). But\nthis interpretation is problematic. For example, one would have\nto explain why the flow channels possess different temperatures and velocities at the same radial distance and, more importantly, why there exists such a regular azimuthal pattern of\ntemperature enhancements/coolings and larger/smaller plasma\nflows. An alternative explanation is that the filaments seen in\ncontinuum images are not individual flow channels, but a collection of them. If the filling factor of the tubes changes regularly in the azimuthal direction, i.e., if the number of flow channels present in the resolution element changes azimuthally, then\none would observe larger LOS velocities and higher temperatures at those positions where there are more tubes (provided,\nof course, that the tubes are hot in the inner penumbra, as suggested by the simulations of Schlichenmaier et al. 1998 and\nthe uncombed inversions of Borrero et al. 2005). The important idea here is that the intrinsic flow speed and temperature\nof the flux tubes would not change azimuthally at a fixed radial distance from sunspot's center, only the filling factor would\nchange. We believe this is a natural explanation for the correla-\n\n\f14\n\nBellot Rubio et al.: Thermal and kinematic structure of the penumbra\n\ntion displayed in Fig. 18. Independent support for this idea has\nbeen gathered from the analysis of full Stokes profiles of nearinfrared lines (Bellot Rubio 2004; Bellot Rubio et al. 2004).\nOur results strongly suggest that the filaments observed in\nDoppler maps at a resolution of about 0.\u2032\u2032 5 are still unresolved.\nThat is, they are not individual flow channels. For this reason,\nin Paper II we referred to them as flow filaments, to clearly\ndistinguish them from the actual, smaller flow channels.\n\n7. Summary\nUsing high spectral and spatial resolution intensity profiles of\nthe non-magnetic Fe \uf769 557.6 nm line, we have studied the thermal and kinematic properties of a sunspot at 23\u25e6 from disk center. The profiles, obtained with TESOS, have been inverted in\nterms of a one-component model atmosphere with gradients of\nthe physical quantities.\nThe temperature, LOS velocity, and microturbulent velocity maps resulting from the inversion show that the fine structure of the penumbra is less apparent in high layers than in\ndeep layers. This suggests that the physical mechanism(s) producing the penumbral filaments operate mainly in the lower\nphotosphere.\nOur analysis confirms the existence of a thermal asymmetry\nbetween the center and limb side penumbra, the former being\nhotter by 100-150 K on average. Such an asymmetry seems to\nbe related to the presence of a larger number of hot structures\nin the outer center-side penumbra, but its nature is still unclear.\nWe have also investigated the origin of the enhanced linewing intensities exhibited by sunspots in the inner penumbra.\nOur results indicate that the bright ring is produced by the\nsmaller line widths and Doppler shifts observed in the inner\npenumbra as compared with the outer penumbra. Thus, it does\nnot reflect temperature enhancements in the mid photosphere.\nThe inferred LOS velocities have been used to determine\nthe geometry of the Evershed flow assuming axial symmetry\nof the flow field. We find that both the flow speed and flow angle increase with optical depth and radial distance. Downflows\nare detected in the mid and outer penumbra, but only in deep\nlayers (log \u03c4500 \u2264 \u22121.4). By means of simulated profiles, we\nhave shown that the velocity stratifications retrieved from the\ninversion are consistent with the existence of penumbral flux\ntubes channeling the Evershed flow. In the inner penumbra,\na deep-lying tube slightly inclined upwards is able to explain\nthe observations. In the outer penumbra, two flux tubes stacked\nalong the LOS and with different inclination angles are necessary. The deep-lying tube is inclined downwards, whereas the\nhigher-lying tube carries upflows. We suggest that the later may\nbelong to a different family of tubes, perhaps the ones first described by Westendorp Plaza et al. (2001).\nFinally, we have demonstrated that there is an excellent\ncorrelation between continuum intensities and LOS velocities\nin the inner center-side penumbra, with larger Evershed flows\nassociated with brighter continuum structures. Very remarkably, however, dark structures also exhibit significant Evershed\nflows. This led us to propose that the bright and dark filaments\nseen in continuum images at a resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 5 are not individual flow channels, but a collection of them.\n\nOur analysis shows that spectroscopy with 2D filter instruments provides a wealth of information on the physical properties of sunspots. Obviously, the next step is to carry out 2D full\nspectropolarimetric observations near the diffraction limit. This\nwill soon be possible with instruments like the Interferometric\nBIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) and the KIS/IAA Visible\nImaging Polarimeter (VIP) attached to TESOS.\nAcknowledgements.
