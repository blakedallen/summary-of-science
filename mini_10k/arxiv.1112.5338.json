At the low energy regime (around\n10-20 MeV/u) one can explore the structure of the exotic nucleus in detail. In this context, deuteron induced\nreactions in inverse kinematics are of great interest because of the reduced Coulomb barrier, when compared to\nheavier targets. These include, elastic, inelastic, transfer and breakup reactions. Single neutron transfer using\n(p,d) or (d,p) is also becoming a common tool to explore\nneutron capture for astrophysics (e.g. [3]).\nGiven the long history of using deuteron induced reactions (in normal kinematics) for studying nuclear structure, a number of reaction theories are well established.\nWith the understanding that breakup strongly affects the\nreaction mechanism when the loosely bound deuteron is\ninvolved, theories including deuteron breakup were developed [4\u20136]. However, until recently the accuracy of the\nmethods has not been quantified. Because the standard\nreaction methods are not based on any normal ordering\nperturbation theory, it is not possible to estimate the accuracy intrinsically. One relies on an independent exact\nformulation of the problem.\nFaddeev devised a method which couples rearrangement, elastic and breakup channels [7] by expanding the\nthree-body wavefunction into three components. For any\ngiven three-body Hamiltonian, the Faddeev method provides the exact solution. For few-nucleon reactions an\nintegral equation formulation for the transition operators [8, 9] proposed by Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas\n(AGS) is commonly used in the momentum-space framework. One critical issue in this method is the well known\n\nCoulomb problem. Screening and renormalization techniques [10, 11] have been developed to handle Coulomb,\nwhich opened the path for applications to deuteron induced nuclear reactions [12, 13]. This method can now\nbe used to benchmark existing nuclear reaction theories.\nOne method of practical use in (d,p) and (p,d) reactions, is the finite range adiabatic method (ADWA) [5]\nwhich takes into account deuteron breakup to all orders\nin the transfer channel while making an important simplification of the continuum. ADWA has been studied\nin detail in [14] and compared to exact Faddeev predictions in [15, 16]. Those studies demonstrate the validity\nof ADWA for (d,p) reactions at low energies (E \u2248 10\nMeV/u), populating states with low angular momentum\nand small separation energy. Results in [16] indicate that\nthe accuracy of ADWA deteriorates with increasing beam\nenergy, angular momentum and separation energy of the\nfinal state.\nADWA is the precursor of the Continuum Discretized\nCoupled Channel Method (CDCC) [6], which does not\nmake approximations in the treatment of the breakup\nstates. While ADWA provides a method to compute\ntransfer alone, CDCC can be used for all, elastic, breakup\nand transfer. CDCC is now a standard tool to study\ndeuteron induced breakup reactions [17]. In CDCC, the\n3-body scattering problem is solved through a set of coupled Schr\u00f6dinger-like differential equations. The breakup\nis included to all orders by expanding the full three-body\nwave function in terms of a complete basis of the projectile's bound and continuum states. A discretization by\naveraging over energy is common to handle the coupling\nbetween the continuum states. In addition to elastic and\nbreakup, attempts have been made to study transfer reactions using the CDCC wavefunction [12, 18\u201321]. In\nthese methods, the exact three-body wavefunction in the\n\n\f2\ntransfer amplitude is replaced by the CDCC wavefunction. Thus, starting from one single three-body Hamiltonian, CDCC can provide, in a consistent manner, elastic,\nbreakup and transfer cross sections.\nIn theory, CDCC should provide an exact solution to\nthe three-body problem. In practice, due to the truncation of the model space this may not be true. For example, it is easy to demonstrate that the truncated deuteron\nCDCC wavefunction does not provide the correct asymptotic form for a bound state in a rearrangement channel.\nA first attempt to compare CDCC and Faddeev was performed in Ref. [12]. Good agreement was found for elastic scattering and breakup for deuterons on 12 C and 58 Ni\nwhile disagreement was observed for 11 Be on protons at\nE = 38 MeV/u in both breakup and transfer observables. The reaction calculations for 12 C and 58 Ni did\nnot include bound states in the rearrangement channels\nand therefore one may naively expect the CDCC solution\nto provide the correct answer to the problem. The disagreement found for the single reaction where a bound\ntransfer state was included, questioned the reliability of\nCDCC and called for a more systematic study.\nThe aim of this work is to quantify the accuracy of\nCDCC in computing elastic, breakup and transfer cross\nsections and establish a range of validity. This will be\ndone by direct comparison with exact Faddeev-AGS calculations (FAGS). Our test cases include deuteron scattering from 10 Be, 12 C, and 48 Ca. These reactions are\nstudied as a function of beam energy, chosen to match\navailable experimental data.\nIn Section II, we describe the details of the CDCC and\nAGS formalisms. In Section III we present the numerical details of the calculations, followed by the results\nand discussions, in Section IV. Finally, the summary and\nconclusions are drawn in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the kinetic energy operators, T\u02c6R and T\u02c6r can be expressed in any of the three Jacobi coordinate pairs [22].\nThe deuteron is modeled by a real potential, Vpn , reproducing its binding energy and the np low energy phase\nshifts. The p-A and n-A interactions are phenomenological optical potentials, UpA and UnA , respectively. They\ninclude absorption from all the channels which are otherwise not included in the model space.\n\nThe CDCC Method\n\nIn the CDCC approach, using the above mentioned 3body Hamiltonian (Eq. 1), the 3-body wave equation of\nthe total system is written as\n[ H3b \u2212 E ] \u03a8CDCC (r, R) = 0 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r and R are the Jacobi coordinates for the p-n and\nd-A systems, respectively. Here E is the total energy of\nthe system in the center of mass (c.m.) frame.\nKeeping in mind that the deuteron is a loosely bound\nsystem, we consider deuteron breakup states explicitly.\nThe eigenstates of the deuteron, \u03c6(r) satisfy the eigenvalue equation (Tr + Vnp ) \u03c6(r) = \u01eb \u03c6(r). To reduce the\ncomputational cost, in this work we ignore the spins of\nthe particles. We perform the standard partial wave decomposition in terms of the orbital angular momentum of\nneutron relative to the proton (l) and the discretization of\nthe deuteron continuum (indexed i) by slicing the continuum into bins and averaging over momentum [6, 17, 22].\nIn this manner, the projectile is represented by:\n\u03c6i (r) =\n\nX\n\nil\n\nl\n\nuil (r)\nYl (r\u0302) ,\nr\n\n(3)\n\nwhere i = 0 refers to the deuteron ground state and i > 0\nto thepnp continuum bin i corresponding to momentum\nki = 2 \u03bcpn \u01ebi /~2 with \u03bcpn being the reduced mass of\nproton and neutron. The projectile continuum is truncated by restricting the orbital momentum (l \u2264 lmax )\nand the energy of the np breakup bins (\u01ebi \u2264 \u01ebmax ). The\nlimits are chosen such that the observables of interest are\nconverged.\nA partial wave decomposition in terms of the relative\nangular momentum between projectile and target (L) is\nalso performed. Thus, the full 3-body CDCC wave function can be written as:\nuil (r)\n\u03c7\u03b1 (R) Yl\u03b1 (r\u0302) YL\u03b1 (R\u0302) ,\nr\n\u03b1\n(4)\nwhere we use \u03b1 as a general index representing the quantum numbers \u03b1 = {ilL}.\nSubstituting Eq.(4) in Eq.(2), a set of coupled-channel\nequations is obtained for \u03c7\u03b1 (R),\n\u03a8CDCC (r, R) =\n\nFor describing the A(d, d)A, A(d, p)B, and A(d, pn)A\nreactions we consider an effective 3-body problem p +\nn + A , such that B is the ground state B = n + A. The\nHamiltonian is then written as\nH3b = T\u02c6R + T\u02c6r + UpA + UnA + Vpn\n\nA.\n\nX\n\nil+L\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012 2\n\u0014\nL(L+1)\nd\n~2\n+\nV\n(R)\n+\n\u01eb\n\u2212\nE\n\u03c7\u03b1 (R)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03b1\u03b1\ni\n2\u03bcdA dR2\nR2\nX \u2032\n+\niL \u2212L V\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 (R)\u03c7\u03b1\u2032 (R) = 0 ,(5)\n\u03b1\u2032 6=\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03bcdA is the reduced mass of d+ A, and E\u03b1 = E \u2212 \u01ebi .\nEq.(5) is solved with the scattering boundary conditions\nfor large R:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c7\u03b1 (R) \u2192 i/2 H\u03b1\u2212 (KR)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b1i \u2212 H\u03b1+ (KR)S\u03b1\u03b1i . (6)\n\n\f3\nHere, H \u2212 and H + are the Coulomb Hankel function [22]\nand S\u03b1\u03b1i is the S-matrix. The coupling potentials in\nEq.(5) are defined by:\nV\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 (R) = h\u03c6il (r)|UpA + UnA |\u03c6i\u2032 l\u2032 (r)i,\n\n(7)\n\nand contain both nuclear and Coulomb parts, which are\nexpanded in terms of multipoles Q up to Qmax .\nAs mentioned before, the CDCC wavefunction Eq.(4)\ncan be used in the exact transition amplitude for\nA(d, p)B. The post form for the transition amplitude\nis then:\n(\u2212)\n\nT = h \u03c7pB \u03c6nA | Vpn + UpA \u2212 UpB | \u03a8CDCC i,\n\n(8)\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL DETAILS AND INPUTS\n\nIn this section we present the pair interactions necessary to define the three-body Hamiltonian as well as\nsome details for the model space used. Both CDCC and\nFaddeev-AGS are computationally expensive, thus, without sacrificing the final goal, we make simplifications to\nthe p + n + A system. To reduce the number of channels,\nwe have neglected the spins of the particles and thus all\nthe spin-orbit terms in the interactions are not included.\nAlso, a single gaussian interaction is used to describe the\ndeuteron and its continuum [27]\n2\n\n(\u2212)\n\nwhere \u03c7pB is the distorted wave generated by the auxiliary potential UpB (depending on R\u2032 , the p-B relative\ncoordinate), and \u03c6nA is the bound state for the final n-A\nsystem. The difference (UpA \u2212 UpB ) is called the remnant\nterm, which is sometimes neglected for convenience. It\nshould be stressed that, in the case of exotic nuclei, it can\nbe very significant. In our study it is always included.\nB.\n\nThe Faddeev-AGS method\n\nThe Faddeev formalism explicitly includes the\ndeuteron d + A, the proton (nA) + p, and the neutron\n(pA) + n components. Three sets of Jacobi variables are\nused such that each component is treated in its proper\nbasis. In the AGS approach the three particle scattering is described in terms of the transition operators T\u03b2\u03b1 ,\nwhere \u03b1 (\u03b2) corresponds to the initial (final) channel in\nthe odd-man-out notation. The transition operators obey\nthe AGS equations [8] that are a system of coupled integral equations\nT\u03b2\u03b1 = \u03b4\u0304\u03b2\u03b1 G\u22121\n0 +\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03b4\u0304\u03b2\u03b3 t\u03b3 G0 T\u03b3\u03b1 .\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b3=1\n\nHere \u03b4\u0304\u03b2\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 and G0 = (E + i0 \u2212 H0)\u22121 is the free\nresolvent with E being the total energy in the three-body\nc.m. system. The two-body transition operator for each\ninteracting pair is derived from the pair potential v\u03b3 via\nthe Lippmann-Schwinger equation\nt\u03b3 = v\u03b3 + v\u03b3 G0 t\u03b3 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe scattering amplitude X\u03b2\u03b1 is the on-shell matrix element of T\u03b2\u03b1 calculated between initial and final channel\nstates as\nX\u03b2\u03b1 = h\u03c6\u03b2 |T\u03b2\u03b1 |\u03c6\u03b1 i.\n\n(11)\n\nIn the case of elastic scattering \u03b2 = \u03b1, while \u03b2 = 0 for\nbreakup and 0 6= \u03b2 6= \u03b1 for transfer reactions. The AGS\nequations (9) are solved in momentum space using partial wave decomposition. The proton-nucleus Coulomb\ninteraction is treated using the method of screening and\nrenormalization [10, 11]. Further numerical details can\nbe found in Refs. [23\u201326].\n\nV (r) = \u2212 V0 e\u2212 (r/r0 ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwith V0 = 72.15 MeV and r0 = 1.484 fm. The potential reproduces the binding energy of deuteron and lowenergy p-n 3 S1 phase shifts but fails heavily in other partial waves. While the comparison of CDCC and FaddeevAGS is meaningful given that the same Hamiltonian is\nused in both formulations, a direct comparison of the predicted cross sections with data should be avoided. We\nhave chosen for all our test cases energies at which data\nexists and thus this study retains its relevance to experiments.\nAn important ingredient to the three-body Hamiltonian, the nucleon-nucleus optical potentials, are all taken\nfrom the global parameterization CH89 [28]. The optical\npotentials are energy dependent and should be considered\nwithin the context of the reaction model. In CDCC calculations, UpA and UnA are calculated at half the deuteron\nincident energy Ed /2, while the auxiliary potential, UpB ,\nis calculated at the proton energy Ep corresponding to\nthe exit channel. The Faddeev-AGS calculations with\nexactly the same choice of UpA and UnA as in CDCC\nyield results for elastic and breakup observables only as\nthere is no transfer channel with complex UnA . We therefore perform also the Faddeev-AGS calculations where a\nreal neutron-nucleus potential is used in the partial wave\ncorresponding to the final bound state. The same interaction is used to produce the neutron-nucleus bound\nstate \u03c6nA in Eq.(8). We take a Woods-Saxon central\npotential with standard geometry: radius r0 = 1.25 fm\nand diffuseness a = 0.65 fm. The depths are adjusted to\nreproduce the neutron separation energy of the relevant\nstate. Details are given in Table I.\nFor both CDCC and Faddeev-AGS, convergence needs\nto be studied in detail. While elastic and transfer observables offered a minor challenge from the point of view of\nconvergence, the same cannot be said of breakup distributions. Even though spins were neglected to reduce\ncomputational cost, breakup calculations proved to be\nat the limit of our numerical capabilities. Due to technical difficulties in the Faddeev-AGS, breakup calculations\nwere performed without Coulomb. In Section III A we\npresent the CDCC model space based on transfer observables.

The details of the\nnon-local parameters used are presented in Table II.

The maximum we include for the p-n partial waves\nis lmax = 5. For the 10 Be target, n-10 Be partial waves\nup to lmax = 8 and p-10 Be partial waves up to lmax = 16\nare included. For the 12 C target, n-12 C partial waves up\nto lmax = 8 and p-12 C partial waves up to lmax = 18 are\nincluded. For the 48 Ca target, n-48 Ca partial waves up\nto lmax = 10 and p-48 Ca partial waves up to lmax = 20\nare included. The maximal total angular momenta considered is Jmax = 60. Depending on reaction and energy,\nsome of these cutoffs can be reduced without affecting the\nquality of the results. The integrals are discretized using\nGaussian quadrature rules with about 50 grid points for\neach Jacobi momentum. The Coulomb screening radius\nis RC = 16 fm. The results are well converged except for\nthe breakup cross sections at small angles. In that case\na special treatment of the pure Coulomb breakup term\nas described in Ref. [12] improves the convergence. However, even with this special treatment including RC = 50\nfm and proton-nucleus partial waves up to lmax = 40 we\nwere unable to get better than 20% accuracy for small angles. We therefore present breakup results neglecting the\nCoulomb force, since the main goal of the present work is\nthe comparison of the methods and not the analysis of experimental data. The Faddeev-AGS calculations without\nCoulomb force are well converged; in this case lmax = 10\nfor p-A partial waves is sufficient.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we present results for elastic scattering,\ntransfer and breakup. For many of the chosen cases,\ndata is available. However, because we neglect spin, the\ndirect comparison with data is not appropriate. It is the\ncomparison between the methods that is meaningful.\nWhile the reference calculations are performed with\nthe neutron and proton optical potentials calculated at\nhalf the deuteron energy, there are small useful variations\nin the interactions that should be considered carefully.\nFor clarity we describe the various labels that will appear\nin the following subsections in Table III. For elastic and\nbreakup, the standard CDCC and Faddeev-AGS calculations are labeled CDCC and FAGS, respectively. These\n\nLabel\n\nUpA UnA nA-bound\n\nFAGS Ed /2 Ed /2\nFAGS1 Ed /2 Ed /2\nFAGS2 Ep Ed /2\n\nno\nyes\nyes\n\nTABLE III: Types of Faddeev-AGS calculations being performed, the labels used, the energies at which the associated\ninteractions were determined and whether a neutron-nucleus\npotential supports a bound state.\n\ntake the nucleon optical potentials UpA and UnA at half\nthe deuteron energy in all partial waves and therefore\nproduce no bound states in the nucleon-nucleus subsystems.\nFor there to be a transfer channel in Faddeev-AGS,\nthe relevant interaction needs to hold a bound state. The\nonly difference between FAGS and FAGS1 is the inclusion\nof a neutron-nucleus bound state (by taking a real interaction for the nA subsystem in the partial wave for which\na bound state exists). Comparing FAGS and FAGS1 for\nelastic and breakup reaction tells us about the importance of coupling to the transfer channel.\nIn evaluating transfer matrix elements, the calculations labeled CDCC take the nucleon-nucleus interactions (UpA , UnA ) in the initial state to be at half the\ndeuteron energy Ed /2 and the auxiliary interaction UpB\nto be at the proton energy in the exit channel Ep , closely\nmimicking the physical process. Therefore it makes sense\nto consider also the Faddeev-AGS counterpart FAGS2,\nwhere UpA is determined at Ep . We note that FADD2\nand FADD of Refs. [15, 16] correspond to our FAGS1 and\nFAGS2, respectively. For completeness we also explore\nthe effect of this subtle difference in the initial Hamiltonian in CDCC, by performing CDCC2 (where all proton\noptical potentials are calculated at Ep , including the one\nin the incoming channel).\n\nA.\n\nElastic Scattering\n\nThe simplest reaction to study is elastic scattering.\nThe elastic differential cross section is sensitive to the\nasymptotic behavior of the three-body wavefunction in a\nvery particular region of phase space, namely when the\nneutron and proton are bound. It is thus one basic test\nfor a complete reaction theory.\nThe elastic cross sections for deuterons on 10 Be, 12 C\nand 48 Ca are shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\nPlotted are the standard CDCC (dashed) and FAGS\n(solid) angular distributions, as well as the results of\nFAGS1 (circles-dotted), when the transfer channel is included. The differential cross section is divided by the\ncorresponding Rutherford cross section to allow for inspection at larger angles. Overall CDCC and FAGS\nagree, with exception of d+12 C at 12 MeV, where some\ndiscrepancy is found beyond 40\u25e6 . The inclusion of the\n\n\f6\ntransfer couplings has a minor effect, as can be seen by\ncomparing FAGS and FAGS1, which produces only small\nmodifications in the distributions, mainly at large angles.\n\n(a)\n\n10\n1\n0.1\n\nTransfer Reaction\n\nWe connect the present work with the comparative\nstudy [16] between the finite-range Adiabatic wave approximation (ADWA) method and Faddeev-AGS. For\nthat purpose, we include in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, the finiterange ADWA predictions (stars-short-dashed). These\ncorrespond to exactly the same Hamiltonian as the\n\n\u03c3 / \u03c3R\n\n(b)\n\n10\nCDCC\nFAGS\nFAGS1\n\n1\n\n(c)\n\n10\n1\n0.1\n0\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\nFIG. 2: Elastic cross section for d+10 Be: (a) Ed = 21.4 MeV,\n(b)Ed = 40.9 MeV, and (c) Ed = 71 MeV.\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 / \u03c3R\n\nContrary to elastic scattering, the transfer process is\ntypically sensitive to the three-body scattering wavefunction at the surface of the target, and therefore poses different challenges for reaction theory. Here, all cases refer\nto transfer to the ground state (g.s.) of the final nucleus.\nIn Fig. 5, we present the angular distribution for 10 Be\n(d, p) 11 Be reaction calculated at Ed = 21.4 MeV, 40.9\nMeV and 71 MeV, respectively. We first compare the\nstandard CDCC (dashed) and standard FAGS1 (solid).\nWe observe that at Ed = 21.4 MeV, the two methods are\nin perfect agreement, but significant discrepancies appear at higher beam energy. To determine how much of\nthose discrepancies can be attributed to the choice of the\nenergy at which the optical potentials are evaluated, it\nis useful to consider the auxiliary calculations CDCC2\n(dotted diamonds) and FAGS2 (dotted circles). Comparing FAGS2 and CDCC2 (both with UpA at Ep in the\nentrance channel) one concludes that the discrepancy is\nalmost independent of the ambiguity in UpA . As in [16]\nwe do find an increasing dependence on the choice of the\noptical potentials with beam energy. CDCC calculations\nshould be independent of the choice of the auxiliary interaction. This is true for the lowest energy, but a few\npercent discrepancy starts to appear as the beam energy\nincreases.\nIn Fig. 6, we show d\u03c3/d\u03a9 for 12 C(d, p)13 C reaction\nat Ed = 12 and 56 MeV. Just as in the case of 10 Be,\nthe CDCC predictions for (d,p) on 12 C at low energy\nprovides a very good approximation to the Faddeev solution (FAGS1). However, the disagreement at 56 MeV becomes significant (around 20 %). Whereas in 10 Be there\nwas a strong dependence of the transfer cross section on\nthe choice of the energy at which the optical potentials\nare evaluated, for 12 C, no such dependence exists (compare FAGS1 and FAGS2 or CDCC and CDCC2) and\ntherefore the disagreement is quantitatively robust.\nIn Fig.7 we present the angular distributions following\n(d,p) transfer to the ground state of 49 Ca at 56 MeV.\nSmall but not negligible discrepancies are found in the\nshapes of d\u03c3/d\u03a9 between FAGS1 and CDCC, accompanied by a significant dependence on the optical potential\n(FAGS2 and CDCC2), which makes the comparison ambiguous.\n\n0.1\n(b)\n\n10\nCDCC\nFAGS\nFAGS1\n\n1\n0.1\n0\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\nFIG. 3: Elastic cross section for d+12 C: (a) Ed = 12 MeV\nand (b) Ed = 56 MeV.\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 / \u03c3R\n\nB.\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0\n\nCDCC\nFAGS\nFAGS1\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\nFIG. 4: Elastic cross section for d+48 Ca at Ed = 56 MeV.\n\n\fd\u03c3 / d\u03a9 (mb/sr)\n\n7\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n8\n\n(a)\n\ntarget Ed (MeV) \u2206A\u2212C (%) \u2206F\u2212C (%) \u2206F\u2212A (%)\n\nCDCC\nCDCC2\nFAGS1\nFAGS2\nADWA\n\n10\n\nBe\n\n12\n\n(b)\n\n48\n\nC\n\nCa\n\n21.4\n40.9\n71.0\n12.0\n56.0\n56.0\n\n\u22123\n3\u00b11\n\u221221 \u221236 \u00b1 19\n\u22129 \u221253 \u00b1 47\n8\n6\u00b13\n13\n\u221221 \u00b1 1\n\u22125\n39 \u00b1 14\n\n6\u00b11\n\u221219 \u00b1 19\n\u221248 \u00b1 47\n\u22122 \u00b1 3\n\u221230 \u00b1 1\n47 \u00b1 14\n\n6\n4\n\nTABLE IV: Percentage differences between the (d,p) cross\nsections at the peak of the angular distribution predicted by\nthe various methods, for the three targets here considered, as\na function of beam energy Ed .\n\n2\n0\n3\n\n(c)\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\nFIG. 5: Angular distribution for 10 Be (d, p) 11 Be: (a) Ed =\n21.4 MeV, (b) Ed = 40.9 MeV, and (c) Ed = 71 MeV.\n\n80\n(a)\n\nd\u03c3 / d\u03a9 (mb/sr)\n\n60\n\nCDCC\nCDCC2\nFAGS1\nFAGS2\nADWA\n\n40\n20\n0\n(b)\n\n15\n10\n\nCDCC calculations performed here, and therefore differ\nfrom those in [16].

Fig. 5 is further evidence that, for l = 0 transfer,\nADWA provides a very good approximation to FaddeevAGS for reactions around 10 MeV/u, as concluded in [16].\nFor 12 C and 48 Ca, ADWA cross sections differ from the\nCDCC predictions by a few percent, usually increasing\nthe discrepancy with the FAGS1 results (as compared to\nCDCC).\nTable IV provides a quantitative estimate for the discrepancy between the various methods here considered.\nWe provide percentage differences of the differential cross\nsections at the peak of the angular distributions: i) \u2206A\u2212C\ncompares ADWA with the standard CDCC, relative to\nCDCC, ii) \u2206F \u2212C compares FAGS1 with CDCC, relative\nto CDCC, and iii) \u2206F \u2212A compares FAGS1 with Adiabatic, relative to ADWA.

We consider FAGS and\nFAGS1, i.e., without and with a bound state in the nA\nsubsystem.\nBreakup calculations are computationally more demanding than transfer or elastic. As mentioned in\nSec. III B, the Faddeev-AGS breakup results obtained\nwith the present technical implementation are not sufficiently accurate at forward angles when the Coulomb\nforce is included. For this reason, the comparison of\nbreakup cross sections is performed switching off the\nCoulomb interaction in both CDCC and Faddeev-AGS.\n[30],\nIn its present implementation, CDCC breakup observables are reconstructed from the asymptotic form\nof the three-body wavefunction.

This\nposes considerable challenges to our numerical methods.\nFor all the CDCC calculations, we went to the numerical limit of the methods, mostly dictated by the number of partial waves included in the deuteron continuum. For the nuclear-only CDCC breakup calculations,\nQmax = lmax = 6 was our model space limit. The error bands in the CDCC cross sections are due to the\ntruncation of the model space, and have been extrapolated from the differences found in the cross sections for\nQmax = lmax = 6 and Qmax = lmax = 4. Typically\nthe calculations at higher energies have a smaller error\nbar because for those energies the effect of these higher\nmultipole couplings is smaller.\nIn Fig.8 we present the results for the angular distribution as a function of the c.m. angle of the pn system\nfollowing the breakup on 10 Be at the three energies of\nchoice. The hashed band, the solid line and the circles\ncorrespond to CDCC, FAGS and FAGS1 predictions, respectively. At the lowest energy, we find that CDCC does\nnot reproduce FAGS, even taking into account the error\nestimated by model space truncation. At the higher energies, this discrepancy is removed. The insets of Fig.8\ncontain the corresponding energy distributions as functions of the proton-neutron relative energy Epn .

Despite the large error bar in the CDCC\npredictions, there is a striking mismatch between CDCC\nand FAGS in both magnitude and shape of the breakup\ncross sections at 12 MeV. These discrepancies disappear\nat the higher energy. Agreement is obtained between\nCDCC and FAGS for the breakup of deuterons on 48 Ca\nat 56 MeV, as shown in Fig.10.\nThe effects of including the nA bound state in the\ntransfer channel is shown with FAGS1 (dotted circles).\nBy comparing FAGS and FAGS1 we conclude that the\neffects of transfer are not negligible on breakup, particularly at low energies.\nAlthough for transfer we found excellent agreement for\nall reactions at low energy (\u2248 10 MeV/u), for breakup it\nis exactly at the low energy that CDCC appears to break\ndown. To better understand this, we have investigated\nthe relevant contributions to the breakup cross sections\nwithin FAGS. In particular, we wanted to understand\nthe relative importance of the three Faddeev components,\n\n\f9\nnamely the deuteron channel, the proton channel and the\nneutron channel, in evaluating the breakup observables.\nWe suspected this was the key to understanding the discrepancies between CDCC and FAGS, because CDCC\nis based on an expansion in the deuteron channel alone.\nEven though in the FAGS calculations there are no bound\nstates in the proton and the neutron channels (UnA and\nUpA contain an imaginary term), the breakup is still distributed between all three Faddeev components. We find\nthat, for breakup at low beam energies, the proton and\nneutron Faddeev components are equally important as\nthe deuteron component, and there are destructive interferences between the various components, at most values\nof Epn , that reduce the cross section significantly.\nAt the limiting case where all the energy is in the\nproton-neutron relative\nmotion, the phase space factor\np max\nEpn \u2212 Epn , where qA is the targoes as \u223c qA \u223c\nget recoil momentum in the c.m. system. This is not\nwell reproduced when expanding in terms of a truncated\ndeuteron basis, as in CDCC. Given the coordinate choice,\nit is expected that the asymptotic behavior of the CDCC\nwavefunction is at its best when the proton and neutron\nare close to each other, but not in the opposite case. The\nresults presented in Figs. 8, 9, 10 are a manifestation of\nthis fact. CDCC breaks down at the lower energy regime,\nwhere we find broader angular and energy distributions\nand there are larger contributions to the breakup cross\nmax\nsection from Epn \u2248 Epn\n.\nOur previous work [18] suggested that the discrepancies between CDCC and Faddeev in breakup arrived as\na consequence of the existence of a bound state in the\nrearrangement channel. Results shown in Figs.8 and 9\ndemonstrate this is not always the case. Even if there is\nno nA bound state, large discrepancies can occur at low\nenergies. The inclusion of a bound state enhances the\ndisagreement, as shown by FAGS1 results in Figs. 8,9,\nand 10.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this study we perform a systematic comparison between CDCC and Faddeev-AGS for deuteron induced reactions. The CDCC formalism under study here corresponds to the standard method introduced in [6], and is\nbased on a truncated expansion on the deuteron continuum. The Faddeev-AGS method considered in this work\ncorresponds to the solution of the AGS equations [8],\nincluding Coulomb screening and renormalization as in\n[11]. For all practical purposes, Faddeev-AGS solutions\nare considered exact and therefore this study should serve\nas a test on the reliability of CDCC.\nWe focus on deuteron reactions on 10 Be, 12 C and 48 Ca,\nincluding a wide range of beam energies. We compute\nelastic scattering, transfer cross sections to the ground\nstate of the final system, as well as breakup observables.\nIn CDCC, elastic scattering and breakup cross sections\nare obtained directly from the S-matrix, while transfer is\n\ncalculated replacing the exact three-body wavefunction\nby the CDCC wavefunction in the exact post-form Tmatrix.\nOur CDCC/FAGS comparisons show no immediate\ncorrelation between elastic, transfer or breakup. In other\nwords, finding agreement for the elastic for a given target\nand beam energy does not imply agreement in breakup\nor transfer. Indeed, these processes are sensitive to different parts of configuration space and therefore, only by\nlooking at elastic, transfer and breakup simultaneously,\ncan the CDCC method be thoroughly tested.\nOverall, and regardless of the beam energy, CDCC is\nable to provide a good approximation to FAGS for elastic scattering. The inclusion of a neutron-nucleus bound\nstate in the FAGS1 calculations introduces small modifications mostly are backward angles. Only for d+12 C\nat 12 MeV we found stronger discrepancies in the elastic\nangular distribution between CDCC and Faddeev-AGS.\nThe comparison of CDCC and Faddeev-AGS for transfer cross sections is consistent with the results presented\nin [16]. We found CDCC to be a very good approximation of FAGS1 at reactions around 10 MeV/u, but not so\ngood for larger beam energies.\nAs opposed to transfer, breakup observables predicted\nby CDCC are at its best for the higher beam energies\nexplored in this work. To reduce the technical challenges\nof the problem, we ignore the Coulomb interaction in\nthe breakup comparison. Also, we use exactly the same\nHamiltonian (CDCC and FAGS) to remove any ambiguity. Taking into account the estimated error due to the\ntruncation of the model space in the CDCC calculations,\nCDCC predictions for the breakup angular and energy\ndistributions are in good agreement with FAGS for all\nbut the lowest energies considered. For deuteron breakup\non 10 Be at 21.4 MeV and on 12 C at 12 MeV, CDCC fails.\nStrong contributions from the proton and neutron Faddeev components, not explicitly included in the CDCC\nexpansion, are present when the proton-neutron relative\nenergies are large. At low energy, the energy distribution is broad, the breakup to scattering states with large\nproton-neutron relative energy is important and therefore CDCC does not perform well. One possible solution\nto this shortcoming is to use the CDCC wavefunction in\na T-matrix that probes only short distances between the\nproton and neutron, instead of its asymptotic form.\nThe present comparisons pose important constraints\non the validity of CDCC when applied to deuteron induced reactions. However, it is critical to realize that the\nnumber of reactions which can be calculated with the\npresent implementation of Faddeev-AGS is more limited.\nIndeed, as the mass of the target increases, Coulomb effects become stronger requiring larger screening radius\nand more partial waves; this renders the solution of the\nAGS equations in the partial-wave representation impossible. In addition, the Pade summation technique used\nto solve the AGS equations converges slower at low energies (10 MeV/u), where couplings are strong, and it is\nnot possible to obtain converged solutions even for mass\n\n\f10\nA = 48. It would be desirable to extend present techniques used in Faddeev-AGS or to develop new methods\nwhich can overcome these difficulties.\nFinally, one should keep in mind that this work is based\non a pure three-body formulation of deuteron induced\nreactions. This assumes that the final bound state populated in the (d,p) reaction is of pure single particle nature. A great challenge and important advance for the\nFaddeev-AGS formulation is the inclusion of degrees of\nfreedom of the target, which is necessary for a more realistic description of the process.\n\nWe thank Ron Johnson and the members of the\nTORUS collaboration for important discussions on this\nwork.
