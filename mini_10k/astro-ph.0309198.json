If the first stars in a 107 M\u2299 dark halo were very massive (> 180 M\u2299 ), then a pair\ninstability supernova from a single massive star can produce sufficient iron to enrich 106 M\u2299 of pristine,\nprimordial gas to [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122.

However, no single star in this mass range can simultaneously explain all halo\nGC heavy-element abundance ratios, such as [V/Fe], [Ti/Fe] and [Ni/Fe].

(iv) why do they have a characteristic\nmean metallicity of [Fe/H] \u223c \u20131.5 with a lower bound of\n[Fe/H] \u223c \u20132.5?\nHere we consider the view that at least some halo GCs\nare 'pre-galactic' in origin (i.e., form before the bulk of\nthe galaxy stars). The idea of pre-galactic GCs is not\nnew, and was first discussed in any detail by Peebles &\nDicke (1968). Peebles (1984) suggested that the hierarchical clustering scenario yields two characteristic scales;\none of which might be identified with GCs which form\nwithin collapsed dark matter (DM) halos prior to galaxy\nformation. Previous studies which have considered cooling\nprocesses in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe, suggest\nthat the first stars may form within a collapsed DM halos\nof 105 \u223c 107 M\u2299 (e.g., Tegmark et al. 1997; Yoshida et\nal. 2003). Therefore, a pre-galactic GC formation scenario\ncan explain the above questions (i) and (ii) naturally. In\naddition, any nucleosynthetic products, the result of star\nformation occurring in such low-mass DM halos, may be\nexpected to have a short mixing timescale leading to a homogeneous chemical composition ((iii)). However, question (iv) is crucial. If GCs are the first objects, they have\nto form from pristine (i.e., zero metallicity) gas, and are\ntherefore expected to have low metallicities (Peebles 1984).\nIn this Letter, we investigate a scenario to address question (iv) in particular. We consider that a single very\nmassive (> 150 M\u2299 ) 'first star', with a consequently short\nlifetime (\u223c 106 years), forms in a virialised halo at very\nhigh redshift (e.g., Abel, Bryan & Norman 2002). The star\nexplodes as a supernova and enriches the pristine gas in\nthe halo, resulting in the formation of a GC with a characteristic abundance pattern. Recent models of the metal\nproduction and ejection of stars with primordial compositions (Hegar & Woosley 2002, hereafter HW02) show that\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nGlobular clusters (GCs) are dense, bound systems of\ntypically 104 \u2212 106 M\u2299 stars. They differ from galaxies\nin that their stellar populations are coeval and have extremely uniform [Fe/H]. Measurements of [Fe/H] (taken\nto trace overall metallicity) show that there appear to be\nat least two distinct sub-populations of GCs in the Galaxy.\nOne represents a spherically distributed halo population,\nwith mean [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.5, the other is spatially flattened,\nwith a higher mean metallicity ([Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.5) (Zinn\n1985). This division is also seen in the kinematics of the\ntwo sub-populations, the halo GCs are largely a pressuresupported system, whereas the metal-rich GCs show signs\nof net rotation leading them to be associated with the\nthick disk (Zinn 1985) or the bulge (Frenk & White 1982).\nThere now exists substantial evidence for multiple populations of GCs in external galaxies (see Ashman & Zepf 1998\nand references therein), which exhibit similar metallicity\ndistributions to those of the Milky Way.\nThe existence of correlations between the mean metallicity of the metal-rich GCs with the mass of their parent\ngalaxies (e.g., Forbes & Forte 2001), suggests that they\nare somehow connected to the formation of the spheroid.\nHowever, their halo counterparts show only weak evidence\nfor such correlations with their parent galaxy properties,\nsuggesting different formation sites and/or formation processes for these objects.\nIn attempting to explain the origin of these GCs we\nmust address the following questions: (i) why do GCs have\na characteristic mass scale? (ii) why do they coalesce so\nrapidly after the big bang (a recent mean age for Galactic GCs is 12.9 \u00b1 2.9 Gyr (Carretta et al. 2000), whilst\nWMAP puts the age of the Universe at 13.7 \u00b1 0.2 Gyr\n(Spergel et al. 2003))? (iii) why are their metallicities\n1 Centre\n\nfor Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC 8122, Australia\nof Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.\n\n2 Department\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBeasley et al.\n\nin a star of above \u223c 150 M\u2299 , the amount of iron produced\nand ejected as a supernova jumps to several solar masses.\nThis is adequate to comfortably enrich 106 M\u2299 of gas (in\na 107 M\u2299 DM halo) to the abundances seen in Milky Way\nhalo GCs (offering an explanation for (iv)). The metals\nejected from the death throws of a single giant Pop. III\nstar will act as an efficient coolant (Omukai 2000) significantly increasing the local cooling rate. This may lead to\na rapid burst of star formation within enriched gas with\na normal initial mass function (IMF). Further star formation is arrested when type II supernovae (SNeII) within\nthe GC expel the remaining gas, enriching and possibly\nreionising the interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Yoshii &\nArimoto 1987, Massimo 2002).\nBefore investigating this scenario in more detail, we note\nthat it is quite likely that GCs form in a variety of different\nprocesses. Indeed, there are many scenarios which address\nthe above questions, and generally favour the idea that GC\nformation is a purely baryonic process (e.g. Fall & Rees\n1977; Fall & Rees 1985; Caputo & Castellani 1984; Kang\net al. 1990; Bromm & Clarke 2002; Kravtzov & Gnedin\n2003). This study does not exclude any of the above ideas,\nbut we argue that on the basis of current theoretical understanding, and observational evidence, a cosmological\norigin for halo GCs cannot be ruled out. We consider\nthat our scenario is a possible solution to the problems\nalluded to previously, and here we test it severely. Moreover, our scenario does not impinge upon the second peak\nof the GC metallicity distribution. Young clusters can be\nformed when gas clouds are shocked, for instance during\nmajor mergers that result in the final host. As Beasley et\nal. (2002) argued using semi-analytic techniques, separate\nformation epochs and/or mechanisms may be required to\nreproduce the observations.\n2. A SINGLE VERY MASSIVE STAR\n\nBy definition, the first star should have primordial abundance, i.e., zero metallicity. Nucleosynthesis calculations\nfor zero metallicity stars are still controversial, nevertheless, due to the extensive work of several groups (e.g.,\nHW02; Limongi & Chieffi 2002; Umeda & Nomoto 2002,\nhereafter UN02), a consensus is rapidly evolving. According to HW02, the enriched ejecta are sensitive to\nthe progenitor star's main sequence mass; non-rotating\nstars over 260 M\u2299 do not eject any metals because they\nbecome black holes which consume all subsequent ejecta\n(e.g., Fryer, Woosley & Heger 2001). Between approximately 140 and 260 M\u2299 lies the domain of pair instability\nSNe (PISNe). These stars are completely disrupted by\nnuclear-powered explosions. Below this mass range it is\nagain likely that black holes are the main product, and\nlittle heavy elements are ejected (Fryer 1999; Woosley &\nWeaver 1995). As PISNe do not result in a black hole,\ntheir explosion mechanism is well understood, compared\nto core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), and their ejection products calculable. Moreover, unlike CCSNe, PISNe are not\naffected by the \"mass cut\", which is the mass coordinate\nthat separates the ejecta from the compact remnant, i.e.,\nthe mass inside of the mass cut has never been ejected.\na \"mass cut\", which is the mass coordinate at which the\nexplosion energy is deposited, i.e., the mass inside of the\nmass cut has never been ejected (Limongi & Chieffi 2003).\nThis mass cut, which is a free parameter in CCSNe models\n\nand to some degree governs the iron yield, is not needed\nin PISNe models.\nWe consider stars within the mass range of 140 to\n260 M\u2299 and adopt the yields for those stars calculated by\nHW02. Fig. 1 shows the expected iron abundance when a\nsingle massive PISNe enriches a given mass of pristine gas.\nThe horizontal solid line shows the observed mean metallicity for Galactic halo GCs ([Fe/H]= \u22121.62), the dotted\nlines show the dispersion on this value (\u03c3 = 0.32; calculated from the February 2003 version of the Harris (1996)\ncatalogue). The lines for each star with indicated masses\nare calculated by [Fe/H]= log(Mej,Fe (ms )/(0.76Mg )) \u2212\nlog(ZFe,\u2299 /ZH,\u2299 ). Mej,Fe (ms ), Mg , ZFe,\u2299, and ZH,\u2299 are the\niron yield for a ms M\u2299 star, the mass of pristine gas, the\nsolar metallicities of iron and hydrogen respectively. The\nvalue of 0.76 is the primordial hydrogen abundance. We\nemploy the solar abundance shown in Anders and Grevesse\n(1989; see Woosley & Weaver 1995), and assume that the\nejected metals are homogeneously distributed, i.e., the one\nzone model.\nThe iron yields of HW02 increase with increasing stellar\nmass. For a typical GC of 105 M\u2299 , forming stars at 100%\nefficency within a 106 M\u2299 halo, the mass of a single Pop\nIII star must be above 180 M\u2299 . Since the star formation\nefficiency is more likely to be \u223c 10%, the mass of the first\nstar must be > 220 M\u2299 embedded in a 107 M\u2299 halo. This\nmass range is consistent with the mass of the first stars\npredicted by numerical simulations (\u223c 200 M\u2299 ; e.g., Abel,\nBryan, & Norman 2000). Thus, Fig. 1 demonstrates that\nthe explosion of a single massive star is capable of enriching gas to the metallicity levels seen in halo GCs. This\nmay explain the characteristic range in the metallicities of\nhalo GCs, as the individual DM halos have a characteristic\nsize, and the stars a limited mass range. Note that a massmetallicity relation for GCs is not necessarily expected in\nthis model (e.g. Murray & Lin 1992), since there may well\nbe dependency between Mg and stellar mass.\n\nFig. 1.- The iron abundance produced when a single massive\nPISN of a given mass enriches the amount of pristine gas shown on\nthe ordinate. The horizontal line shows the observed mean metallicity ([Fe/H]=\u22121.62) for halo GCs. Dotted lines show the dispersion\n(\u03c3 = 0.32; see text).\n\nHere we consider the case that the first star is a sin-\n\n\fThe Metallicity of Pre-Galactic Globular Clusters\ngle very massive star, and induces a PISN. However, stars\nwith main sequence masses between \u223c 8 and \u223c 40 M\u2299\ncan also produce heavy elements through CCSNe. Although, as mentioned previously, the iron yields of CCSNe\nare affected by poorly constrained parameters such as the\nmass-cut, the expected highest possible iron yields from\nCCSNe (30 M\u2299 star in UN02) are \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 . To enrich\nthe halo pristine gas to the same level as a 232 M\u2299 star,\nwhich produces 19.4 M\u2299 iron, at least \u223c 95 CCSNe are required. Thus, although multiple CCSNe are another possible means of adequate iron enrichment, a total of 2850\nM\u2299 of gas must be converted to stars effectively simultaneously. Therefore, although not a unique solution, a\nsingle PISN is a more efficient (and plausible) enrichment\nmechanism.\n3. ELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES\n\nOne consequence of our scenario is that the observed\nabundances for different metals within a single GC should\nbe due to enrichment from a single star. By comparing the\nobserved abundances with the predicted yields of HW02\nwe may read off the mass of the first star responsible for\neach GC. Fig. 2 shows the various abundance ratios of\nPISN yields of HW02 as a function of progenitor stellar mass. The dotted lines are the observed range of the\nabundance ratios for stars in several Galactic GCs. The\nobserved abundance ratios come from high resolution spectroscopic data of RGB stars, in which the lighter elements,\nsuch as O, Na, Ma, and Al, are possibly affected by stellar\nevolution such as dredge up. Thus, we here focus on relatively heavy elements, i.e., heavier than Si, which should\nbe unaffected by such evolutionary processes. The panels\nof [Si/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] show that a star of mass between\n220 and 240 M\u2299 is in remarkably good agreement with\nthe observational data. Such stellar masses are consistent\nwith the range discussed previously. Thus, a star with\nmass around 230 M\u2299 is a strong candidate for the first\nstar in our GC formation scenario.\n\nFig. 2.- The abundance ratios from PISN yields as a function\nof the main sequence mass of the progenitor star. The dotted line\nshows the range, i.e., maximum and minimum, of the abundance\nratios in observed GCs (NGC 6287, NGC 6293, NGC 6541: Lee &\nCarney 2002; M4: Ivans et al. 1999; NGC 7006: Kraft et al. 1998;\nM15: Sneden et al. 1997; M13 Kraft et al. 1997).\n\nHowever, we find that the yields for this mass cannot\n\n3\n\nreproduce all the abundance ratios observed. For example, the other panels of Fig. 2 demonstrate that [Ti/Fe],\n[V/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] for a 230 M\u2299 star is significantly below the observed range. The observed range of [Ti/Fe]\nand [V/Fe] requires a star of < 180 M\u2299 , whilst [Ni/Fe]\nrequires a star with less than 150 M\u2299 , or greater than 250\nM\u2299 . This is clearly a problem for the model; the theoretical yields and observations could be reconciled by postulating enrichment from a small number of stars rather\nthan a single star, e.g., the combination of a 230 M\u2299 stars,\nand several < 150 M\u2299 stars. However, the most serious\nproblem of PISN enrichment for GCs is the absence of\nany elements above the iron group due to a lack of any sand r-process (HW02). In the stars of the GCs in Fig. 2,\nelements such as Ba, La, and Eu are present in significant quantities. Additional physics such as rotation of the\nmassive star, or subsequent pollution of the immediate\nenvironment could provide solutions to this problem. Alternatively, there may some additional contribution from\nnormal CCSNe, although this makes the scenario less appealing.\nSince accurate stellar abundances are crucial to this issue, and the sample of GCs with such measurements is\nsmall, we strongly encourage high resolution spectroscopic\nmeasurements of individual stars in a larger sample of\nGCs. In addition, since many species may be effected by\nthe mixing of nuclear products in cluster giants (e.g. Kraft\n1994), such analyses should be applied to main-sequence\nstars providing reliable abundance ratios for lighter elements such as [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe].\nAs a result, although the proposed scenario can explain\nseveral observational properties of GCs, there some are serious problems. The current generation of population III\nyields favour the formation of multiple stars (which should\nbe more than 8 M\u2299 ) over a single massive star, with the\ninclusion of a source of neutron-capture elements.\n4. OBSERVATIONAL CONSEQUENCES\n\nThere are several interesting observational consequences\nof our proposed scenario. If the abundance ratios predicted\nby the PISN yields can be reconciled with the observations,\nand they are the result of a single massive first star, then\nthe mass of that star could be derived. With sufficiently\ndetailed abundance ratio observations of GCs, the mass of\nthe precursor Pop. III object could be extracted, which,\ncombined with the mass of the GC would allow the star\nformation efficiency to be calculated.\nIf all Pop. III stars were very massive, then none will\nsurvive to the present day. Very low metallicity stars,\nsuch as that recently observed in the halo of our galaxy\n(Christlieb et al. 2002) with [Fe/H] \u223c \u22125 could in fact\nbe younger than the halo GC population. Such stars may\nsimply have formed out of gas enriched by some secondary\n'normal' SNe II in the GCs, and such low abundances could\njust be the result of dilution with pristine, or very metalpoor gas (for an alternative view, see Limongi et al. 2003).\nThe GCs produced in our scenario form out of enriched\ngas such that they have a normal IMF. They produce normal numbers of SNeII 3 which serve to end further star\n\n3 The number of SNe II (from stars with the mass of > 8M ) expected from a Salpeter IMF (mass range between 0.1 and 60 M ) is \u223c 730.\n\u2299\n\u2299\nThe total energy of SNe II (730\u00d71051 erg) is slightly larger than the energy of 230 M\u2299 PISN (60 \u00d7 1051 erg). Subsequent to star formation,\nwhich consumes the gas, the remaining gas density would be low. Therefore, we expect that these SNeII would have more power to blow out\n\n\f4\n\nBeasley et al.\n\nformation by expelling the remaining gas, a mechanism\nwhich naturally produces a population of stars with a very\nuniform age. The gas expelled by these SNe would have\nabundances typical of a more normal stellar population,\nrather than those for Pop. III stars. Thus field stars, the\ndiffuse ISM and the Lyman\u2212\u03b1 forest could consist of gas\nenriched by normal SNeII products.\nIs is also interesting to speculate whether or not these\nGCs would be visible using the next generation telescopes,\nsuch as the James Webb Space Telescope (Carlberg 2002).\nIf detectable, then the angular correlation function would\nmake it possible to distinguish between GCs in their own\nhalos or GCs associated with galaxies as larger halos have\na higher correlation amplitude. Although many of our\nhalo GCs will have subsequently fallen into larger halos\n(Monaco et al. 2002) some will have survived as free floating GCs to the present day (e.g., West 1993).\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have demonstrated that there does indeed appear\nto be enough iron production within such a single massive\nstar to enrich 106 M\u2299 of gas to the levels required to reproduce 'halo' GC iron abundances. Also, abundance ratios\nsuch as [Si/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] predicted from the yields of\nstars with around 230 M\u2299 are consistent with those observed in Galactic GCs. However a deficit other elements\n(e.g. Ti, V, N) and complete absence of elements above the\niron group results in inconsistencies with the current observational data. This problem could be circumvented either\nby postulating an initial giant binary system, fragments\nof several stars (Nakamura & Umemura 2001), or missing\nphysics in the nucleosynthesis models of giant stars, such\nas rotation. Further investigation of this point requires\nboth more sophisticated numerical simulations, and more\ndetailed models of high mass, zero metallicity stars. Irrespective of these difficulties, we argue that the detailed\nabundance analysis of main-sequence stars in GCs provides important clues to the nature of Population III objects.\nWe have assumed that the pristine gas in the collapsed\nhalo was not completely blown away by the first PISN.\nFor 230 M\u2299 the energy is \u223c 60 \u00d7 1051 ergs (HW02). If the\ngas fraction in the collapsed halo is the same as the cosmic mean (\u03a9b /\u03a90 = 0.04/0.27: Spergel et al. 2003), and\nboth the DM halo and the gas follow the density profile\nsuggested by Navarro, Frenk, & White (1997), then for a\nformation redshift, z = 15 and a concentration parameter, c = 4, the binding energy for a gas mass of 106 M\u2299\nis predicted to be \u223c 3 \u00d7 1051 ergs. As this is well below the hypernova energy, we should expect the gas to\nbe blown out of the halo, preventing the induction of a\n\nsecond generation of star formation that makes the GC.\nHowever, according to high resolution 1-d simulations of\na single SN remnant by Thornton et al. (1998), 90 % of\nan initial SN energy is lost to radiative cooling in its early\nexpansion phase. In this case the SN energy for 230 M\u2299\nbecomes comparable to the binding energy. Moreover, the\nambient gas density increases with redshift, and radiative\ncooling is expected to be even more efficient in such high\ndensity gas. High resolution numerical simulations of a\nsingle SN in a collapsed halo at high redshift would be\nextremely useful to test this idea (e.g., Mori, Ferrara, &\nMadau 2002; Bromm, Yoshida, & Hernquist 2003 4 ). Such\nsimulations would enable us to investigate how smoothly\nmetals are mixed with halo gas, since our picture assumes\nan instantaneous, well-mixed solution.\nFinally, we discuss perhaps the most important hurdle\nfor any cosmological GC scenario. Moore (1996) pointed\nout that the prominent tidal tails observed for some GCs,\nsuch as M2 (Cudworth & Hanson 1993) suggests that such\nGCs do not possess DM halos. He supported this argument with a simulation of a GC orbiting in a static potential. The analytic argument presented by Moore (1996)\nderives the tidal radius for M2 with and without DM, with\nthe former being closer to the observed truncation radius\nof 60pc. However, this argument does not discuss the formation time of the GC or the characteristic radius of the\nGC DM halo. The characteristic radius of a 107 M\u2299 halo\nforming today is several kpc, much larger than the tidal radius derived for M2. GCs form at high redshift, therefore\ntheir characteristic radii are much smaller and they could\npotentially have retained much of their halos. This argument misses the major drawback of this simple analytic\napproach \u2013 the environment of the GC is not expected to\nremain smooth during the formation epoch of a large host\nhalo, which is built up by a succession of mergers. Even\ntoday, at the radius of 8\u221210 kpc, the halo is not symmetric\nas the potential of the disk is not negligible, supplying periodic impulses to any orbiting object. We believe that the\nabove estimate for the tidal radius is too simplified. Numerical simulations similar to those of Moore (1996), but\nincluding the active evolution of the halo potential and/or\nthe disk potential would be an extremely useful test for\nthe existence of DM in GCs.\nMAB thanks the Swinburne RDGS.
