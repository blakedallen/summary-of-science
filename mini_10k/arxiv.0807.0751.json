In interferometry, disturbance of the phase of light\nor matter waves in one arm of the interferometer can be\nmeasured by a displacement of the interference fringes\nwith a sensitivity determined by the fringe wavelength\nand the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is under\nmany circumstances given by the standard\n\u221a shot noise,\nleading to a resolution that scales with 1/ N , where N\nis the number of detected atoms.\nThe shot noise limit, however, can be beaten with entanglement and squeezing [7], proving that it is not a fundamental limit and in the scenario of Ref.[8], for example, a particular entangled preparation scheme has been\nshown to give a phase error scaling as 1/N 3/4 , while in\nprinciple the Heisenberg limit should provide the optimum sensitivity with a phase error scaling as 1/N [9].\nMany analyses of nonclassical metrology with quantum\nobjects have dealt with the situation of particles or fields\nthat may be prepared in suitably entangled states, and\nentangled measurements may be used after they have experienced the interaction of interest [10]. Conversely, entanglement created by many-body interactions improves\nthe precision of estimating the corresponding coupling\nconstant, as discussed recently [11, 12].\nIn this paper we arrive at a 1/N 3/4 scaling for a dis-\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nnegretti@phys.au.dk\n\nplacement measurement with particles that are, however,\nnot entangled at all. We consider a system of bosonic\natoms, which are cooled to Bose-Einstein degeneracy and\nprepared in a joint collective quantum state, described by\nmean field theory, i.e., by a Hartree-Fock product state\nwave function. We take for the latter a dark soliton, a\ntopological excitation stabilized by atom-atom interactions. The soliton has a density minimum at a location\nq, and this position can be used to monitor the phase\nacquired in an atomic matter wave interferometer in the\nnonlinear regime [13, 14, 15]. A recent experiment has\ndemonstrated the relevance of the relative phase in splitting and recombining a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),\nalthough the direct observation of solitons was not possible [16]. In a similar way, very recent experiments have\ngenerated solitons that oscillate and collide in a harmonic\ntrap, in the crossover regime between one dimension (1D)\nand three dimensions (3D) [17]. As we have shown in a\nrecent publication [18], the decrease of the soliton width\nwith the number of atoms (a nonlinear effect) gives rise\nto an improved position resolution, surpassing the shot\nnoise threshold, when more and more particles are used\nfor the experiment.\nAtom clouds are typically analyzed by taking (pixelized) absorption or phase contrast images, giving access\nto the atomic density profile. If one wants to measure\nsome quantity of interest, the resolution is limited by the\nfluctuations in the image due to counting noise on every pixel. We characterize these fluctuations and specify\nhow to extract, in an (almost) optimal way, information\nfrom the noisy data. It turns out that the quantum fluctuations beyond the Hartree-Fock product state actually\ndo not spoil the image resolution, but even improve it\nslightly, although the power law scaling with the atomic\ndensity (\u223c n\u22123/4 ) is unchanged. In this paper, we present\na description of these elements of the theory, providing\n\n\f2\na number of technical ingredients and details that were\nonly briefly mentioned in Ref.[18].\nIn Sec.II, we introduce the quantum image of an atomic\ncloud, define the associated Fisher information (FI) and\nrecall its connection to optimal parameter estimation,\nstarting from the image data. We treat solitons and vortices in a mean field description with Poissonian counting\nstatistics, and we introduce a general Gaussian Ansatz\nfor the counting statistics within an image, for which\nthe Fisher information can be determined analytically.\nDifferent scalings with the atomic density are identified\nthat range between the shot-noise and the Heisenberg\nlimits, depending on the system dimension and the kind\nof nonlinearity. In Sec.III, a quantum field theory of\natomic density correlations is developed within the Bogoliubov approximation. We provide a discussion of the\nrole of phonon and zero (or Goldstone) modes, and we\npresent detailed calculations for the density fluctuations\nin the image of a dark soliton. The location of the soliton is, due to the breaking of translational symmetry of\nthe problem, itself associated with a Goldstone mode,\nand the corresponding contribution to particle fluctuations are analyzed. In this section, we also construct a\nnearly optimal protocol for image processing. In Sec.IV\nwe give a brief summary and conclusion.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nMEAN FIELD IMAGES\nAtom density statistics\n\nThe continuous popularity of cold quantum gas physics\nis due, in part, to the possibility of measuring atomic\ndensity profiles by fluorescence or absorption imaging.\nAdopting the language of second quantization, the corresponding observable is the intensity or density operator,\nn\u0302(x) = \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u0302(x),\n\n(1)\n\nintegrated along a line of sight. (We shall omit this integral in the following.) An 'image' thus corresponds\nto a set of measured densities {\u03c1(x)|x}. Averaging over\nmany images, one gets an estimate for the expectation\nvalue \u03c1\u0304(x) = hn\u0302(x)i. If the detector integrates the density signal over some small, but finite area Apx (s) (the\n'pixel' no. s = 1, 2, . . . M ), one deals with a discrete set\nof operators like\nZ\ndx n\u0302(x).\n(2)\nn\u0302s =\nApx (s)\n\nCorrelations between the atomic density in different\npoints are related to the field operator in the following\nway, using the bosonic commutation relations\nhn\u0302(x)n\u0302(x\u2032 )i = h\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x\u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(x\u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(x)i\n+ hn\u0302(x)i\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThis quantity defines the density correlation function\nP(x, x\u2032 ) = hn\u0302(x)n\u0302(x\u2032 )i \u2212 hn\u0302(x)ihn\u0302(x\u2032 )i\n\n(4)\n\nthat will play a key role in this paper.\nLet us illustrate these concepts for the case that the\nquantized field operator \u03a8\u0302(x) can be reduced to a single\nmode. This is a common approximation at low temperatures where a macroscopic fraction of atoms condenses\ninto a single spatial wave function. The operator \u03a8\u0302(x) is\nthen replaced by a single annihilation operator \u00e20 multiplying a classical complex field \u03a6(x), and the average\ndensity is given by\nhn\u0302(x)i = N0 |\u03a6(x)|2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere N0 = h\u00e2\u20200 \u00e20 i is the number of atoms in the 'condensate mode' \u03a6(x) (itself normalized to unity). The\ndensity correlations, essentially the structure factor of\nthe system [19], are found as\n\u0001\nP(x, x\u2032 ) = \u2206N02 \u2212 N0 |\u03a6(x)|2 |\u03a6(x\u2032 )|2\n+ N0 |\u03a6(x)|2 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(6)\n\nThe first term, proportional to the Mandel parameter [20], vanishes if the system is in an eigenstate of\nthe operator \u00e20 , i.e., a coherent state (Poisson statistics).\nThe second term describes local fluctuations at the same\nposition (for an image: in the same pixel), with a variance that is equal to the mean density (the mean atom\nnumber on the pixel).\nIt is intuitively clear that when more than a single\nspatial mode are taken into account in the field operator\nexpansion, valuable information about the field's quantum state is hidden in the correlations of the atomic density [21]. This has been discussed recently for the Mott\ninsulator\u2013superfluid transition [22, 23], and exploited in\nmeasurements on the strongly correlated Mott insulator\nphase with ultracold 87 Rb atoms released from an optical lattice [24]. Excited modes also introduce additional\nfluctuations into an image, however. The competition\nbetween these two effects will be the central theme of\nthis paper.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nParameter estimation\nInformation measures\n\nThe full joint probability distribution of the atom numbers in every pixel provides the complete 'counting statistics' of an image. The information content of an image\nis given by the counting statistics via the classical information entropy I, which for a pixelized image is given by\n(e.g., see [25])\nI=\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03c11 ,...\u03c1M\n\np({\u03c1s }) log p({\u03c1s }).\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nIn (7), p({\u03c1s }) is the joint probability measure for the\noccurrence of detection events with \u03c1s atoms detected in\npixel px(s) (M is the total number of pixels).\nA particular application of this information concept\nappears when we want to estimate a parameter q \"hidden\" in the image, i.e., the counting statistics is a function p({\u03c1s }; q) of the parameter q, referred to as the likelihood function (LF) in statistical estimation theory. The\nhidden parameter can be the fraction of particles in the\ncondensate mode, the width of the cloud, or the position\nof a \"solitonic\" excitation, i.e., the location of a minimum in the density profile. This will be our example\nthroughout the analysis. Information processing theory\nprovides an explicit formula for the optimal signal-tonoise ratio in measuring q. It can be translated into\na lower limit on the variance, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound\n(CRB), Var(q) \u2265 1/F (q). Here, the Fisher information\nF (q) is given by [25, 26]\nF (q) = \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03c11 ,...\u03c1M\n\np({\u03c1s }; q)\n\n\u2202 2 log p({\u03c1s }; q)\n.\n\u2202q 2\n\n(8)\n\nIn a quantum mechanical framework, the FI has a geometrical interpretation as distance (metric), depending\non a parameter q, in the space of density operators [27].\nThe multiple sum in Eq.(8) is difficult to evaluate in general, and we shall focus in this paper on two schemes\nwhere the calculations are feasible: (i) the single-mode\napproximation for the field operator, assuming Poissonian atom number counting statistics; (ii) a Gaussian\napproximation for the probability measure, where the results can be expressed in terms of the average density and\nthe density correlations. The latter scheme will be applied to a multi-mode field theory within the Bogoliubov\napproximation.\nTo estimate the parameter q we require a definite prescription of how to extract it from the data that fluctuate\nfrom shot to shot. We shall in particular identify an optimal prescription that permits to saturate the Cram\u00e9rRao bound.\n2.\n\nPoissonian counting statistics\n\nThe single-mode approximation is well known as the\nmean-field theory for BEC. We assume here that the\nvariance of condensate particles is normal, \u2206N02 = N0\n(Poisson statistics) so that the density correlations are\ngiven by the last term in Eq.(6). The mean field theory\nis equivalent to a Hartree product state Ansatz for the\nmany-body wave function. As a result, the probability\nmeasure p({\u03c1s }) factorizes into Poissonian statistics for\neach pixel. The summation in Eq.(8) can then be performed analytically. When we take the limit of infinitely\nsmall pixels, one finds an integral over the spatial coordinate of the image [28]\n\u00152\n\u0014\nZ\n\u2202|\u03a6(x; q)|\n,\n(9)\nF (q) = 4 dx\n\u2202q\n\nwhere we have made the dependence of the average density profile |\u03a6(x; q)|2 on the parameter q explicit. (From\nhere on, the complex field \u03a6 is not normalized to unit\nnorm, but its square gives the mean density of the condensate particles.)\nThe meaning of this formula can be illustrated by a discussion of the optimal signal processing strategy. Given\nthe image data \u03c1(x; q), we construct, as in Refs.[28, 29],\na linear filter g(x) to provide an estimate for q:\nZ\nS(q) =\ndx g(x) \u03c1(x; q)\nZ\n\u2248 q dx g(x) \u2202q \u03c1(x; 0),\n(10)\n\nwhere g(x) is a local gain function on the pixel at position x that can take positive and negative values. In\nthe second step we have assumed, without loss of generality, that the signal vanishes when the parameter q is\nzero, and we have performed a Taylor expansion of the\ndensity profile, \u03c1(x; q) \u2243 \u03c1(x; 0) + q \u2202q \u03c1(x; 0). The expectation value of the signal, S\u0304(q), is simply obtained in\nterms of \u03c1\u0304(x; q) = hn\u0302(x)i and its derivative.\nThe variance of the signal is found by squaring Eq.(10)\n(first line) and expressing the average in terms of the\ndensity correlation function (4)\nZ\n\u2206S 2 =\ndxdy g(x)g(y)P(x, y; q).\n(11)\n\nRecalling that different pixels are uncorrelated [Eq.(6)\nreduces to its last term], this variance reduces to\nZ\n\u2206S 2 = dx g 2 (x) \u03c1\u0304(x; 0).\n(12)\n\nWe can now choose the gain function g(x) such that the\nsignal-to-noise ratio SNR = S\u0304 2 (q)/\u2206S 2 is maximized.\nThis optimization problem has the following solution, as\npointed out in Ref.[29] for a coherent state of light populating a single spatial mode:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\n\u2202|\u03a6(x; q)|\ngopt (x) =\n.\n(13)\n|\u03a6(x; 0)|\n\u2202q\nq=0\nHere \u03b1 is a normalization constant. This gain function\ncan also be interpreted as an optimized spatial mode\n(the \"noise mode\" in the language of Ref.[29]), onto\nwhich Eq.(10) projects the image. The minimum uncertainty \u2206q for the parameter estimation corresponds to\nan SNR of unity, and this reaches the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound\n(\u2206q)2 \u2261 Var(q) = 1/F (q) with F (q) given\n\u221a by Eq.(9). If\nthe wave function \u03a6 were proportional to N0 , we would\n1/2\nfind a shot-noise limited resolution, \u2206q \u221d 1/N0 . Due\nto atom-atom interactions, this limit can be overcome, as\nwe shall see.\n3.\n\nGaussian images\n\nGiven the mean atom number per pixel \u03c1\u0304s (q) and\nthe (pixelized) density correlation matrix Psj (q) with\n\n\f4\n[cf.

Since a Gaussian is fully characterized\nby its first and second moments the probability measure\nis simply given by [25]\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(2 \u03c0)\u2212M/2\n1\np(\u03c1; q) = p\nexp \u2212 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304) * P\u22121 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304) ,\n2\ndet(P)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the vector \u03c1 of length M collects the detected atom\nnumber variables, \u03c1\u0304 collects the corresponding mean values, and P is the covariance matrix with elements Psj (q).\nThe likelihood function p(\u03c1; q) depends on q through\n\u03c1\u0304s (q) and Psj (q).\nWith the Ansatz (16) for the LF and by replacing the\nsum over discrete particle counts by continuous integrals,\nthe FI is given by the following analytical expression [18]\n(\n\u00152\n\u0014\n1 \u2202q2 det(P)\n\u2202q det(P)\nF (q) =\n\u2212\n(17)\n2\ndet(P)\ndet(P)\n\uf8fc\n\u0015\uf8fd\nX \u0014 \u2202 2 (P\u22121 )s j\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304s \u2202 \u03c1\u0304j\n.\nPs j + 2 (P\u22121 )s j\n+\n\u2202q 2\n\u2202q \u2202q \uf8fe\ns,j\n\nIf no correlations exist between neighboring pixels, this\nexpression reduces to Eq.(9) for the Poisson case, provided one takes both the limit of small pixel size and large\naverage atom number per pixel. This is as expected since\nfor a large average, Poisson and Gaussian statistics become similar. We discuss an example taken from Ref.[18]\nbelow.\nCorrelations between pixels may increase or decrease\nthe FI and make the parameter estimate more or less\nprecise. A detailed calculation is discussed in Sec.III C.\nC.\n\nExamples: kinks and vortices\n\nWe evaluate now the Fisher information for measurements of the position of a solitonic excitation in a Bosecondensed gas. We consider first a 1D setting where the\nquantum field theory is given by the following nonlinear evolution equation for the field operator [the GrossPitaevskii equation (GPE)] [19, 30]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\nh\u03042 \u2202 2\n\u2020\ni h\u0304 \u03a8\u0302 = \u2212\n+ Vext + g \u03a8\u0302 \u03a8\u0302 \u03a8\u0302,\n(18)\n\u2202t\n2 m \u2202x2\nwhere m is the atom mass, Vext is an external potential, and g the binary interaction strength proportional to\n\nthe s-wave scattering length as . Within mean-field theory, the field operator is replaced by the complex order\nparameter \u03a6(x) (the condensate wave function or order\nparameter) that also satisfies Eq.(18). The mean atom\ndensity is then \u03c1\u0304(x) = |\u03a6(x)|2 , thus normalizing the order\nparameter to the particle density.\nA family of \"dark\" solitonic excitations of the Bose\ncondensate exists for repulsive interactions (g > 0). In\nthe homogeneous case (Vext = 0), it is given by [19]\n\u221a n\no\np\nn\ni\u03c5 + c2 \u2212 \u03c5 2 tanh [\u03ba(\u03c5)(x \u2212 q)] ,(19)\n\u03a6(x; q) =\nc\n\nwhich shows a local minimum in the density at the\nposition q \u2261 q(t) = q(0) +\u221a\u03c5t. The\np width of this\n\u22121\ndip is specified\nby\n\u03ba(\u03c5)\n=\n(\n2\n\u03be)\n1 \u2212 \u03c5 2 /c2 where\n\u221a\n\u03be = h\u0304/ 2 m g n is the so-called healing length and n is\nthe one-dimensional \"background\" density. The soliton\nmoves with constantp\nvelocity \u03c5 that does not exceed the\nsound velocity c = n g/m. For a soliton at rest, the\ndensity is strictly zero at x = q, and the phase of the condensate wave function increases by \u03c0 when crossing this\npoint (a \"kink soliton\"). The kink becomes wider and\nthe density dip disappears as the velocity \u03c5 \u2192 \u00b1c. The\nwavefunction in (19) is normalised such that the atom\ndensity asymptotically approaches the constant value of\nn (actually, after few healing lengths). Such solitons have\nbeen created in BEC experiments by shining a laser field\non one half of the atomic ultracold cloud, which induced\na relative phase by the AC Stark effect [31].\nTopological excitations in two dimensions are vortices\nwhere the phase of the wave function increases by a multiple of 2\u03c0 when circling around a zero in the density. We\ndiscuss an example below.\n1.\n\nDark soliton\n\nDue to the shot noise fluctuations in the detected\natoms the density dip is washed out and one has to find\na good estimate for the kink position q. The formula (9)\nfor the FI within Poisson statistics can be evaluated exactly for the dark soliton given by Eq.(19). The result\nis [recall that Eq.(9) implies the limit of infinitely small\npixels]\n\u221a\n\u0015\n\u001a\n\u0014\n4n 2 \u03c5\n\u03c5/c \u2212 c/(2 \u03c5)\n\u221a\nF =\n(20)\narctan\n\u03be\nc\n2 \u03be \u03ba(\u03c5)\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n8n\n\u03c52\n\u03c5/c\n+\n\u2212 arctan \u221a\n2 + 2 \u03ba(\u03c5).\n3\nc\n2 \u03be \u03ba(\u03c5)\nAs expected from translation invariance, after integration\nover x, this does not depend on the soliton position q . In\nFig.1 we plot the minimum uncertainty \u2206q = F (q)\u22121/2\nof the soliton position in units of the condensate healing length, as a function of the soliton velocity \u03c5. This\nbehaviour makes good sense: when the soliton is almost\nat rest, the dip is very sharp and a precise knowledge of\n\n\f5\n3\n\n300\n\nn \u03be = 50\n1\n\u03be\u03ba(\u03c5)\n\nn \u03be = 100\n\u03c5/c = 0\n\n200\n\n\u2206q/\u03be\n\nF\u2032\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n100\n1\np\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1\nF \u2032 (\u03c5)\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\u22121\n1\n\n200\n\nFigure 1: (Colour online) Soliton position uncertainty \u2206q, in\nunits of the healing length \u03be, versus soliton velocity \u03c5 (c is\nthe speed of sound). The scaled Fisher information is given\nby F \u2032 = F \u03be 2 .\n\nthe soliton position can be gathered; when the velocity\napproaches c, the dip in the density becomes very shallow, and less information is available from density measurements. For comparison, the dashed curve shows the\nwidth 1/\u03ba(\u03c5) of the density dip: we see that the measurement precision can largely exceed this value. The\nmaximum information is\n\u221a\n16 mg 3/2\n16 n\n=\nn ,\n(21)\n\u03c5=0:\nF = \u221a\n3 h\u0304\n3 2\u03be\nwhich implies that, for a soliton at rest, the uncertainty\nin q scales like n\u22123/4 with the background density n. As\npointed out in Ref.[18], this is a better scaling than the\nusual shot noise limit (\u223c n\u22121/2 ). We emphasize that this\nenhancement does not require any squeezed or otherwise\nentangled multi-atom state. It simply follows from the\nshorter wavelengths that occur in a BEC matter wave\ninterferometer due to the atom-atom interactions.\nThe scaling with the density can be understood with\nthe following statistical argument: the atom number on\na pixel of p\narea \u2206x at position x is given by N (x) =\n\u03c1(x) \u2206x \u00b1 \u03c1(x) \u2206x, assuming fluctuations at the shotnoise level.

We recover the\nvariance and mean of the Poisson distribution by choosing a covariance matrix with Ps j = Var(\u03c1s ) \u03b4s j = \u03c1\u0304s \u03b4s j ,\nwith the variance of the number of atoms on the s-th\npixel equal to its mean value \u03c1\u0304s (q).\nThe integral in Eq.(14) with the order parameter given\nin (19) can be worked out analytically and the derivative\nwith respect to q performed. The FI (17), scaled to F \u2032 =\nF \u03be 2 , then becomes\n\"\n#\nX gs\n1 X gs\n\u2032\n2 2\n2 2 2\nF = n \u03be (1 \u2212 \u03c5 /c )\n,\n+\n\u03c1\u0304s (0) 2 s \u03c1\u03042s (0)\ns\n(24)\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the healing length \u03be sets the scale for the density\nvariation around the dip. By processing different data\npoints across the relevant\u221aregion, this uncertainty can\nbe reduced by a factor 1/ M where M \u2248 \u03be/\u2206x is the\nnumber of pixels across the dip, which leads to a precision\nof the order of\nr\n\u03be\n\u221d n\u22123/4 .\n(23)\n\u2206q \u223c\nn\nLet us now turn to the Gaussian approximation to the\nlikelihood function of an image and discuss the Fisher\n\nwhere we have put q = 0 without loss of generality and\n\b\n2\ngs = sech2 [\u03ba(\u03c5)(xs + \u2206x)] \u2212 sech2 [\u03ba(\u03c5) xs ] , (25)\n\n\u03c1\u0304s (0) = n \u2206x \u2212 2 n \u03be 2 \u03ba(\u03c5) {tanh [\u03ba(\u03c5)(xs + \u2206x)]\n(26)\n\u2212 tanh [\u03ba(\u03c5) xs ]} ,\n\nwith xs = s\u2206x, and s an integer. This expression is\ngiving those pixels a stronger weight where the density\nprofile significantly changes, as could have been expected.\nAs a consequence, pixels at the outer limits where the\natomic density is flat (already a few healing lengths away\n\n\f6\nfrom the soliton position q) do not contribute to the FI.\nWe can therefore safely assume that the soliton is located\nwell in the interior of a detection window for imaging, and\neven take the limit of an infinitely large window. (For\na discussion of the limit \u2206x \u2192 0, see Ref.[18].) That\nis also confirmed in Fig.2(a): we show the dependence\nof the FI on the soliton position q within a pixel. The\noscillations occur at the pixel size \u2206x, but for \u2206x \u2192 0,\ntheir amplitude becomes smaller and F \u2032 is almost flat. In\nFig.2(b), we fix the value of \u2206x and change the soliton\nvelocity \u03c5. Also in that case the FI has a maximum for\nq = 0 (soliton at the border between two pixels).\n\n2.\n\nFhom\n\u2243 0.11,\nFtrap\n\nTrapped soliton\n\nThe previous discussion shows that the information\ncontent is concentrated near the soliton position. This\nsuggests that trapped solitons, in an inhomogeneous\nbackground, behave in a similar way.\nConsider first a soliton at rest in a square potential of\nlength 2l. Assuming a single-mode picture with Poissonian number statistics, the FI becomes\nF \u2032 = n2 \u03be 2\n\nwhere ax is the (single-particle) ground state size in the\nharmonic trap. This leads to the usual shot-noise scaling\n\u22121/2\nN0\nfor the soliton position. Most of the atoms, however, are not needed for the image since the information\ncontent is concentrated near the soliton minimum. In this\nrespect, the trapped situation is favorable compared to\nthe homogeneous case since the central density is higher\nand the healing length is smaller in the center than in\nthe condensate wings. This can be made quantitative by\ncomparing the harmonic trap to a homogeneous sample\nof the same size and same total number of atoms. The\nratio of the Fisher Information between the two cases is\nthen\n\nX gs (\u2206x)\ns\n\n\u03c1\u0304s (0)\n\n\u03b8(l \u2212 |xs |),\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the step function \u03b8(x) appears. As expected, only\nthose pixels covering the confining box contribute to the\ninformation. In the limit l \u2192 \u221e, we recover the result of\nan infinite Bose gas given by the first sum of (24) with\n\u03c5 = 0. The same discussion can be applied to the Gaussian approximation for the complete counting statistics.\nIn a harmonic trap, the order parameter can be approximately written as [32]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx\u2212q\n,\n(28)\n\u03a6(x; q) \u2243 \u03a6bg (x) tanh \u221a\n2 \u03be0\nwhere \u03a6bg (x) is the Thomas-Fermi (TF) solution for the\ntrap ground state [33], \u03be0 is the healing length for the\nbackground density at the soliton position (it depends on\nthe density n0 = |\u03a6bg (q)|2 [34]). Let us focus on solitons\nat rest, close to the centre of the trap, q \u2248 0, and much\nsmaller than the size RTF of the background field. The\nFI (9) then turns out to be\nFtrap (q) \u2243\n\n16 n0\n\u221a\n,\n3 2 \u03be0\n\n(29)\n\nwhich is very similar to the homogeneous case, keeping\nthe density n0 the same.\nThis result can be written in different ways by expressing the central density n0 in terms of other parameters.\nTaking, for example, the total number of atoms, we find\nFtrap\n\nN0\n\u2243 14.1 2 ,\nax\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\nwhere corrections of order \u03be/RTF are neglected, consistent with the TF approximation. It should be noted that\nthe size of the system in both cases scales in a different\nway with the atom number.\n\n3.\n\nSolitons with three-body interactions\n\nThe GPE relies on the two-body pseudopotential\ng\u03b4(x), which describes the interaction between the particles. One can also consider low-dimensional Bose superfluids in a strong-coupling regime with three-body collisions. We analyze here the solitonic solution in a quasi\n1D setup governed by the equation (homogeneous case)\ni h\u0304\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nh\u03042 \u2202 2\n\u2202\n4\n\u03a6\n+\n\u03b3\n|\u03a6|\n\u03a6= \u2212\n\u2202t\n2 m \u2202x2\n\n(32)\n\nwith the universal coupling constant \u03b3 = (h\u0304\u03c0)2 /(2m).\nThis system has been investigated in detail in Refs.[35,\n36]. There exists an analytical\nsoliton solution for the\n\u221a\norder parameter \u03a6(x; q) = nf (x)ei\u03c6(x) , with\n3[1 \u2212 (\u03c5/c)2 ]\np\n,(33)\n2 + 1 + 3(\u03c5/c)2 cosh[\u03ba\u2032 (x \u2212 q)]\np\n\u03ba\u2032 = 2\u03c0n 1 \u2212 (\u03c5/c)2 .\n(34)\n\nf 2 (x; q) = 1 \u2212\n\nThis kind of solitons can also appear in a degenerate electron plasma [37], since the equation for the order parameter describing the electron density is almost the same.\nAs opposed to Eq.(19), the soliton width 1/\u03ba is scaling\nhere \u223c 1/n with the density n, and we therefore expect\nan improvement in the soliton kink estimation. Indeed,\nusing the Poisson formula (9) for the Fisher information\nwe obtain for a soliton at rest\n\u221a\n\u221a\nF = 2 3\u03c0 ln(2 + 3) n2\n(35)\nthat can be compared to Eq.(21). With such topological\nexcitations we thus reach a 1/n scaling as in the Heisenberg limit, without any entanglement or squeezing.\n\n\f7\n4.\n\nVortex line\n\nFinally, we consider a two-dimensional situation with\na vortex line. The vortex solution of the 3D GPE is described by a core region where the density goes to zero.\nVortices are not stable solutions, however, and only in a\nframe rotating with a high angular velocity they correspond to local or global energy minima [19]. Vortices in\na rotating BEC with respect to the lab frame were observed in several experiments, as for example in Ref.[38].\nWe assume the simple case of a Bose gas with uniform\nconfinement along the z axis (length L) and homogeneous in the xy-plane. The solution of the GPE for a gas\nrotating around the z axis is given by [19]\np\n\u03a6(r; q) = n/L f (x, y, z; q)\n\n\u0012\n\nx \u2212 q + iy\nx \u2212 q \u2212 iy\n\n\u0013s/2\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere n is the two-dimensional density, f is a real function, (q, 0) is the position of the vortex line in the xyplane, and s is an integer (the 'winding number' or 'topological charge'). The order parameter (36) is an eigenfunction of the angular momentum with eigenvalue h\u0304 s.\nSince we are interested in the calculation of the FI (9),\nwhich depends only on the absolute value |\u03a6|, the angular dependence is not relevant in the present setting. In\nthe following we specialise to the case of a singly charged\nvortex s = \u00b11. The function f can then be well approximated by [30]\np\n(x \u2212 q)2 + y 2\np\nf (x, y, z; q) \u2243\n.\n(37)\n2 \u03be 2 + (x \u2212 q)2 + y 2\nWe generalize Eq.(9) for the FI to this two-dimensional\nsetting and obtain\nF =4\n\nZL\n0\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\ndxdy\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2202|\u03a6(r, \u03c6, z; 0)|\n\u2202q\n\n\u00152\n\n= \u03c0 n,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the integration is easy to perform in cylindrical coordinates. It is interesting to note that for a vortex line,\nthe FI depends on the (two-dimensional) density n linearly. Hence, the fact that the vortex core scales with the\nhealing length does not improve the shot-noise limit for\nits position detection. This can be understood from the\nsimple argument of Eq.(23) because the relevant number\nof atoms scales with n\u03be 2 \u223c h\u03042 /(2mg2D ) which is only\nweakly dependent on the density: the dimensionality of\nthe topological excitation plays a crucial role.\n5.\n\nDimensionality crossover\n\nThe last example has shown that the dimension of\nthe topological excitation is very important. Coming\nback to the quasi-1D situation, we discuss here briefly\nthe crossover of the nonlinear terms in the GPE as one\n\nchanges the confinement transverse to the long trap axis.\nThe 1D solitons described by Eq.(18) are difficult to realize in an experiment because one needs a high ratio between radial and axial trap frequency. When transverse\neffects are taken into account with more accuracy, the\nGPE is modified into a 1D non-polynomial Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation [39, 40, 41, 42]. This changes, for example,\nthe oscillation frequency of a dark soliton in a harmonic\ntrap [41]. In the limits of weak and strong coupling, the\nnonlinearity in the effective GPE becomes polynomial,\nand analytical results for solitonic solutions (bright and\ndark) can be given [39]. By inspecting these dark solitons, it is easy to show that the Fisher information scales,\nin the strong coupling regime, as n2 with the background\ndensity n, identical to the scaling found in Sec.II C 3.\nThis beats the shot noise scaling (F \u221d n) and illustrates\nthat also with the help of two-body interactions, one can\nreach the scaling of the Heisenberg limit in a strongly\ninteracting system.\n\nIII.\n\nQUANTUM FIELD THEORY FOR IMAGES\n\nA.\n\nMotivation\n\nMean field theories are ubiquitous in physics and play\nan important role in the explanation of many phenomena\nin condensed matter physics [43, 44], e.g. superconductivity in metals, and even in high energy physics as for\nexample the quark condensate in the so called instanton ensemble in QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) [45].\nThe mean field approach describes successfully key features of quantum degenerate dilute gases [19, 30], for\nexample the static, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates [46], and it\nhas been well confirmed in a number of experiments (see,\ne.g., Ref.[47]). The mean field approximation applied to\nan ultracold Bose gas leads to the Gross-Pitaevski equation (18). The stationary solutions of the GPE represent the macroscopically occupied spatial mode functions\nwhen the temperature of the trapped gas is well below\nthe critical transition temperature. This concept can be\nformally translated, in the U (1) symmetry broken approach, in the following way: the total matter field is\nsplit into \u03a8\u0302(x) = \u03a6(x) + \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x), where \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x) represents\nquantum fluctuations around the Gross-Pitaevskii solution \u03a6(x). The mean field approach essentially neglects\nthe fluctuation field.\nMean field methods, however, assess only the average\natomic density and do not provide information about\nquantum noise correlations, which are important in the\nunderstanding of quantum phase transitions in ultracold\natoms, e.g., anti-ferromagnetic structures or charge density waves [48].\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nBogoliubov approximation\n1.\n\nPhonon and zero modes\n\nEven at zero temperature, the particle density shows\nfluctuations that lead to the phenomenon of \"quantum\ndepletion\" [19, 49, 50]. This can be described by linearizing the total many-body problem around the mean\nfield solution. In other words, one expands the second\nquantised Hamiltonian up to quadratic terms in the fluctuation field \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302. The dynamics of the latter is then generated by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes linear operator\n\u0013\n\u0012\nH + g |\u03a6|2\ng \u03a62\n,\n(39)\nL=\n\u2212g \u03a6\u22172 \u2212H \u2212 g |\u03a6|2\nwhere we have introduced the Gross-Pitaevskii Hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\nh\u03042 \u2202 2\n+ Vext (x) + g |\u03a6(x)|2 \u2212 \u03bc,\n2 m \u2202x2\n\n(40)\n\nand \u03bc is the chemical potential.\nThe mode expansion of the fluctuation operator \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\nis complicated by the fact that L has eigenvectors with\neigenvalue zero. These arise from continuous symmetries\nthat leave invariant the energy of the Bose-Einstein order parameter \u03a6 [43]. A well-known example is the U (1)\nglobal phase invariance of the GPE (40), another one is\nthe translation in space of the soliton solution (19) for a\nhomogeneous system. By choosing a dark soliton solution with a definite phase \u03b8 and a given position q, one\nhas spontaneously broken these symmetries. According\nto the non-relativistic Goldstone theorem [44, 51], this\nspontaneous symmetry breaking is associated with gapless excitation modes, the Goldstone modes, for any system of particles with finite range interactions. The Goldstone modes produce quantum fluctuations of the phase\nand position of the soliton order parameter, even at zero\ntemperature. The global phase is conjugate to the number of particles, and the phase fluctuations can indeed\nbe interpreted as a consequence of the variations of the\nchemical potential with particle number [33].\nThe eigenvalues Ek of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes operator (39) correspond to eigenvectors (uk , vk ) that we\ndenote \"phonon modes\". They are normalized and orthogonal according to\nZ\n\u03b4kp = dx {u\u2217k (x)up (x) \u2212 vk\u2217 (x)vp (x)}\n(41)\nand are accompanied by partner modes (vk \u2217 , uk \u2217 ) with\nnegative norm and eigenvalue \u2212Ek\u2217 . This construction\nfails for the so-called zero modes (u\u03b1 , v\u03b1 ) that are in the\nkernel of L [50, 52, 53]. For the global U (1) symmetry,\nthe zero mode is (\u03a6, \u2212\u03a6\u2217 ) that is generated by applying\n\u2212i\u2202/\u2202\u03b8 to (\u03a6ei\u03b8 , \u03a6\u2217 e\u2212i\u03b8 ). The norm (41) of this mode is\nad\nzero. We need partner or adjoint modes (uad\n\u03b1 , v\u03b1 ) to saturate the completeness relation in the space of fluctuation\n\nfields. They can be constructed by solving the equation\nad\nL(uad\n\u03b1 , v\u03b1 ) = m\u03b1 (u\u03b1 , v\u03b1 ). The generalized eigenvalue\nm\u03b1 is called the \"effective mass\". One gets zero modes\nof L2 and a completeness relation in the form [53]\n\u03b4(x \u2212 y) =\n\nX\nk\n\n+\n\n{uk (x) u\u2217k (y) \u2212 vk\u2217 (x) vk (y)}\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n\u2217\nad\n\u2217\n{u\u03b1 (x) [uad\n\u03b1 (y)] \u2212 v\u03b1 (x) v\u03b1 (y)},\n\n(42)\n\nwhere \u03b1 enumerates all broken symmetries and the adjoint modes are normalized such that\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nZ\n\n\b\nad\u2217\ndx uad\u2217\n\u03b1 (x)u\u03b2 (x) \u2212 v\u03b1 (x)v\u03b2 (x) .\n\n(43)\n\nIn our one-dimensional soliton system, we expect two\nGoldstone modes associated with the global soliton phase\n\u03b8 and its position q. The corresponding quantum fluctuations will prove important for our analysis. We give the\nphonon and zero modes for this geometry in Appendix A.\nThe fluctuation operator \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x) around the GrossPitaevskii solution \u03a6(x) is expanded as\n\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x) =\n\nX\nk\n\n+\n\n{b\u0302k uk (x) + b\u0302\u2020k vk\u2217 (x)}\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n{P\u0302\u03b1 uad\n\u03b1 (x) \u2212 i Q\u0302\u03b1 u\u03b1 (x)}.\n\n(44)\n\nThe operators are constructed to implement the commutation relation [\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x), \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (y)] = \u03b4(x \u2212 y): b\u0302k , b\u0302\u2020k are\nbosonic annihilation and creation operators, [b\u0302k , b\u0302\u2020p ] =\n\u03b4kp , and for all broken symmetries in the problem,\nthe \"position\" and \"momentum\" operators Q\u0302\u03b1 , P\u0302\u03b1 are\ncanonically conjugate, [Q\u0302\u03b1 , P\u0302\u03b2 ] = i\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .

Going beyond Ref.[18], we consider the\ncase of phonon modes at finite temperature. The field expansion (44) is useful for the computation of expectation\nvalues because different modes are not correlated.\n\n\f9\nEvaluating the average density, we get\n\u0011\nX\u0010\nh\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u0302(x)i = |\u03a6(x)|2 +\n1 + hb\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k i |vk (x, q)|2\nk\n\n+\n\nX\nk\n\nhb\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k i|uk (x, q)|2\n\n+ Z(x),\n\n(47)\n\nwith the occupation number hb\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k i = 1/(e\u03b2Ek \u2212 1). For\nthermal states, hb\u0302q i = 0. The so-called quantum depletion is related to the finite contribution \u223c |vk |2 of phonon\nmodes even at zero temperature: this is a direct manifestation of quantum density fluctuations. Finite temperature adds thermal contributions to the phonon modes.\nThe zero mode contribution is obtained as\nXn\n2\n2\n2\n2\nZ(x) =\n|uad\n(48)\n\u03b1 (x)| hP\u0302\u03b1 i + |u\u03b1 (x)| hQ\u0302\u03b1 i\n\u03b1\n\no\n\u2217\nad\n\u2212Re [u\u2217\u03b1 (x) uad\n\u03b1 (x)] \u2212 Im [u\u03b1 (x) u\u03b1 (x)]h{P\u0302\u03b1 , Q\u0302\u03b1 }i ,\n\nwhere {*, *} denotes the anticommutator. For the global\nU (1) symmetry, the relevant operator averages are:\nhP\u0302\u03b82 i = N0 , hQ\u03022\u03b8 i = 1/(4 N0), and h{P\u0302\u03b8 , Q\u0302\u03b8 }i = 0, they\nfollow from the assumption that the condensate mode is\nin a coherent state with N0 particles on average. The\nstate for the Goldstone mode associated with soliton displacement is discussed in Sec.III B 3 below. For the moment, we only assumed that the operators Q\u0302\u03b1 , P\u0302\u03b1 average to zero which is plausible since they appear only\nquadratically in the Hamiltonian.\nWhen quantum fluctuations around the mean field are\ntaken into account, different spatial locations can become\ncorrelated beyond the level of Eq.(6) because they probe\nthe same delocalized excitation modes. We find the density correlation function P(x, y; q) [Eq.(4)] by a straightforward expansion of the four-point field correlations to\nsecond order in the fluctuation operator \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302 (this is consistent with the Bogoliubov approximation). Thus we get\nfor phonons in a thermal state\nP(x, y; q) \u2243 [\u03a6\u2217 (x)\u03b4\u03a8(x) + \u03b4\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a6(x)]\n\nk\n\no\n+ hb\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k ifk (y)fk\u2032 (x)\no\nXn\nhP\u0302\u03b12 i\u03b7\u03b1 (x)\u03b7\u03b1\u2217 (y) + hQ\u03022\u03b1 i\u03c6\u03b1 (x)\u03c6\u2217\u03b1 (y) ,\n+\n\u03b1\n\n(49)\n\nwhere we introduced the functions\n(50)\n\nfor the phonons, and the abbreviations\nad\u2217\n\u03b7\u03b1 (x) = \u03a6\u2217 (x)uad\n\u03b1 (x) + u\u03b1 (x)\u03a6(x)\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x) = i\u03a6\u2217 (x)u\u03b1 (x) \u2212 iu\u2217\u03b1 (x)\u03a6(x)\n\n3.\n\nQuantum statistics of soliton position\n\nIn the second-quantized many-body theory, the soliton position is described by an operator Q\u0302q whose fluctuations \"fill\" the density dip, as discussed by Dziarmaga [32, 54]. In a homogeneous geometry, the dynamics of Q\u0302q is similar to a free particle, the corresponding Hamiltonian in the Bogoliubov approximation being\nP\u0302q2 /2mq . The stationary states of this Hamiltonian are\nmomentum eigenstates where the soliton position is maximally uncertain. However, the effective mass occurring\nhere is negative, mq = \u22124m(n/\u03ba). This mimicks the\nnegative kinetic energy of the classical (non-quantized)\nmoving soliton [55, 56]. A similar phenomenon occurs in\na harmonic trap where the soliton displacement mode has\na negative frequency (the mode is called anomalous) [32].\nThese degrees of freedom are therefore thermodynamically unstable, and we cannot use thermal statistics.\nDziarmaga in Ref.[32] has suggested an alternative approach to specify the quantum state of this degree of\nfreedom, to be used as initial condition for the subsequent dynamics. The idea is to \"pin\" the soliton to the\nposition q by minimizing the density \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (q)\u03a8\u0302(q), which is\na quadratic form in P\u0302q and Q\u0302q [see Eq.(48) at x = q]. As\nshown in Ref.[18], one finds in this way a Gaussian state\nsimilar to the ground state of a harmonic oscillator with\nrespect to the \"Hamiltonian\" (in quotes since it has not\nthe dimensions of energy):\n\u0125(P\u0302q , Q\u0302q ) =\n\n1 2\n\u03ba\nP\u0302 + n\u03ba2 Q\u03022q \u2212 ,\n16n q\n4\n\n(52)\n\nwhere the mode functions of Appendix A, Eqs.(A7, A8)\nhave been used. The ground state of this Hamiltonian\ngives h\u0125i = 0 and can also be written as the vacuum\nstate corresponding to the annihilation operator\n\n\u00d7 [\u03a6\u2217 (y)\u03b4\u03a8(y) + \u03b4\u03a8\u2020 (y)\u03a6(y)]\n\u0011\nX n\u0010\n=\n1 + hb\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k i fk (x)fk\u2032 (y)\n\nfk (x) = \u03a6\u2217 (x)uk (x) + vk (x)\u03a6(x)\nfk\u2032 (x) = \u03a6\u2217 (x)vk\u2217 (x) + u\u2217k (x)\u03a6(x)\n\nthat appear like \"mode functions\" for the zero mode\noperators. We have simplified Eq.(49) by noting that\nIm [u\u2217\u03b1 (x) uad\n\u03b1 (x)] = 0 for the zero mode functions given\nin Appendix A. To proceed, we have to specify the quantum state of the soliton displacement modes.\n\n(51)\n\n\u221a\n\u2212i\nb\u0302q = \u221a\nP\u0302q \u2212 2n\u03ba Q\u0302q .\n8n\u03ba\n\n(53)\n\nWith the help of b\u0302q and its conjugate operator, we can\nwrite the expansion of \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(x) in the same form as for the\nphonon modes.\nWe consider here two classes of states that generalize this ground state: \"squeezed\" states and \"thermal\"\nstates. The squeezed state depends on the positive parameter \u03b6: it is defined as a Gaussian state with quadrature variances\nhP\u0302q2 i\u03b6 =\n\n2n\u03ba\n,\n\u03b6\n\nhQ\u03022q i\u03b6 =\n\n\u03b6\n,\n8n\u03ba\n\n(54)\n\n\f10\nWe note that these states give average density profiles\nthat resemble a partially filled dark soliton, as illustrated\nin Fig.3. The deviations from the \"optimal case\" are controlled by the parameters \u03b6 or \u03c4 . The quantum states\nconstructed here are not stationary states of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, however, and will evolve in time, as\ndiscussed in Ref.[32].\n\n1\n\nh\u03a8\u0302\u2020(x)\u03a8\u0302(x)i\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nx/\u03be\n\nC.\nFigure 3: (Colour online) Density profiles in the notch: the\nsolid (black) line corresponds to the squeezing parameter \u03b6 =\n1 whereas the dashdot (red) to \u03b6 = 100, while the dashed\n(blue) line corresponds to the thermal state with parameter\n\u03c4 = 5/\u03be. Other parameters are: l = 10 \u03be, n \u03be = 100, and 140\nphonon modes have been taken into account.\n\nwhere \u03b6 = 1 corresponds to the ground state.\nFor this state, we\n\u0001 get an average density h\u0125i\u03b6 =\n(\u03ba/8) \u03b6 \u22121 + \u03b6 \u2212 2 \u2265 0. The density at x = q vanishes for \u03b6 = 1, and Fig.3 actually shows the result of\nEq.(47), including contributions from quantum noise, for\nthat case.\nThe thermal state is defined by analogy to the canonical ensemble as a state that maximizes entropy at a\ngiven mean value of \u0125. This mean value is given by\nh\u0125i\u03c4 = 21 \u03ba/(exp[\u03ba/(2\u03c4 )] \u2212 1) and it is controlled by a\nparameter \u03c4 with the dimension density. The quadratures are\nhP\u0302q2 i\u03c4\n\nhQ\u03022q i\u03c4\n\n= 2n\u03ba coth[\u03ba/(4\u03c4 )],\n\nJ (x, y) = Re\n\n(\n\nX\n\ncoth[\u03ba/(4\u03c4 )]\n.\n=\n8n\u03ba\n(55)\n\nDiscussion of results\n\nIn Fig.3 we show density profiles corresponding to different values of the squeezing parameter \u03b6 = 1, 100 and\nfor the thermal parameter \u03c4 = 5/\u03be. The plot confirms\nthat the choice \u03b6 = 1 (or when \u03c4 \u2192 0+ for a \"thermal\" q-state) gives the state with minimum depletion\nthat best resembles a condensate with a perfect soliton.\nFor \u03c4 = 5/\u03be the minimum in the notch is not zero (as for\n\u03b6 6= 1), but the density at the edges becomes higher than\nthe density of the squeezed quantum state, reflecting the\n\"thermal\" and the long wave nature of the zero q-mode\nstate.\nFor what concerns the density correlations, it is convenient to bring them in a form where the \u03b4-correlated\nterm in Eq.(3) that appears due to normal ordering, is\nsubtracted. To this effect, we use the completeness relation (42) to rewrite the sum over uk (x)u\u2217k (y) in the\ncorrelation function (49) as\nP(x, y) = \u03a6(x)\u03a6(y) [\u03b4(x \u2212 y) + J (x, y)] ,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the function J (x, y) is found as\n\n[2 vk (x) vk\u2217 (y) + uk (x) vk\u2217 (y) + vk (x) u\u2217k (y)]\n\nk\n\n)\n\n(57)\n\nn\no X\nad\u2217\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\nad\n\u2217\n+ 4 hP\u0302\u03b82 iuad\n{u\u03b1 (x) [uad\n\u03b8 (x)u\u03b8 (y) + hQ\u0302q iuq (x)uq (y) \u2212\n\u03b1 (y)] + u\u03b1 (x) u\u03b1 (y)}.\n\u03b1\n\nIn Fig.4 we show the behavior of J (x, y) for two different\nvalues of the squeezing parameter. Between \u03b6 = 1 (left)\nand \u03b6 = 100 (right), the overall magnitude of J (x, y)\nchanges significantly, demonstrating a strong influence of\nthe soliton displacement mode. For a large uncertainty in\nQ\u0302q (\u03b6 = 100), the function J (x, y) is positive everywhere\nand concentrated near x \u2248 y \u2248 q. The choice \u03b6 = 1 leads\nto negative values (anticorrelations) along the diagonal\nx = y away from the point x = y = q.\nThe calculation of the Fisher information is done nu-\n\nmerically by using the phonon and zero modes of Appendix A, normalizing them in a box of length 2l. In\nFig.5(a), we show the Fisher information for different approximations: a single-mode BEC with Poisson statistics\n[dotted line: homogeneous system, solid line: in a finite\nbox, Eq.(27)] is compared to a multi-mode calculation\nwith a Gaussian counting statistics (dashed, dot-dashed,\nand thin solid lines). The correlation matrix gives contributions to the FI via the derivatives of P\u22121 and det(P)\nwith respect to the soliton position [see Eq.(17)]. We\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the function J (x, y) defined in Eq.(57). Parameters: l = 10 \u03be, n \u03be = 100, and 140 phonon modes have been\ntaken into account.

The three terms here are\nthe contributions of the mean field, the phonon contribution, and the sum over the Goldstone (or zero) modes.\nThe Goldstone contribution is negative and reduces the\nnoise even below the phonon level.

The thin solid line corresponds to the FI\nfor a thermal state with a parameter \u03c4 = 0.2/\u03be.\nFirst, it is interesting to note that one gets more information in a box than in the homogeneous case. This is\na finite-size effect which enhances the impact of \"missing\natoms\" in the soliton center. Second, the exact result\nfor the Gaussian multi-mode theory (17) shows that correlations, including the zero modes, increase the level of\ninformation that we can extract, beyond mean-field theory (single-mode approximation). Moreover, the dashed\ncurve for \u03b6 = 1 shows that minimizing the quantum \"filling\" of the notch provides the highest information. The\ndivergence of F \u2032 at small pixel size is due to the failure of\nthe Gaussian approximation which becomes unphysical,\nas the average atom counts per pixel drop below unity,\nsee Ref.[18].\nIn Fig.5(b) we show the scaled Fisher information versus the scaled density n. Both mean-field and multi-mode\ntheory give a linear scaling with n which translates into\nthe same power law n\u22123/4 for the sensitivity of the soliton\nposition.\nIn order to understand why the inclusion of noise with\nthe Bogoliubov description provides an even better resolution than the mean field, we use the formalism of signal\nprocessing introduced in Sec.II B 2. The signal-to-noise\nratio gives an assessment of the amount of information\nthat can be extracted from a given statistical estimation\nstrategy. By using the completeness relation (42) and\nthe result (57) it can be easily shown that the noise \u2206S 2\n[Eq.(11)] splits into\n\n300\n\n700\n\n\u03b6 = 1.5\n200\n\n500\n\n100\n\n300\n\n(a)\n0\n0.1\n\n(b)\n1\n\n2\n\u2206x/\u03be\n\n3\n\n100\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nn\u03be\n\nFigure 5: (Colour online) (a) Rescaled Fisher information\nF \u2032 = F \u03be 2 versus pixel size for different regimes: solid (black)\nline for a Poissonian counting statistics in a box and the dotted (green) line in the uniform Bose gas limit.

Recall that for the density correlations (56), J (x, y) is multiplied by the product \u03a6(x)\u03a6(y)\nthat is zero for x = y = q and increases to a positive constant n for x = y 6= q after a few healing lengths. This\n\n\f12\nfurther enhances the negative contributions of J (x, y),\nand reduces the noise \u2206S 2 relative to the mean-field approach.\nThe above discussion clarifies how the Cram\u00e9r-Rao\nbound can be smaller for multi-mode fields compared to\nthe mean field description. But can one also identify a\nstrategy to reach the CRB? In the Poissonian case, without correlations, the SNR with the optimal gain function gopt (x) [Eq.(13)] reaches the sensitivity given by the\nFisher information (9), and this happens when the variance \u2206S 2 \u221d S\u0304(q). We shall proceed in the same way with\nthe multi-mode theory, but work with finite pixel areas\nto avoid the breakdown of the Gaussian approximation.\nIn that case signal and noise are given by\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304\n\u2206x,\n\u2202q\n\u2206S 2 = g * P g \u2206x2 ,\nS\u0304(q) = g *\n\n(59)\n\nwhere the vector g (length M ) represents the values of\nthe gain function g(xs ) on the pixels. These expressions\nare the discrete versions of Eqs.(10, 11).\nWe can achieve \u2206S 2 \u221d S\u0304(q) by solving the linear system P g = \u2202q \u03c1\u0304, giving an optimal gain function gao . It is\nthen easy to check that the last term in Eq.(17) becomes\nX\ns,j\n\n(P\u22121 )sj\n\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304s \u2202 \u03c1\u0304j\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304\n=\n* P\u22121\n\u221d S\u0304(q).\n\u2202q \u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\n(60)\n\nWe were not able to find a similar proportionality for\nthe term Tr[(\u2202 2 P\u22121 /\u2202q 2 )P]. A numerical analysis, illustrated in Fig.5(b), shows that we are nevertheless very\nclose to the CRB with the gain function gao .\nWe emphasize that this argument only requires the\nfirst and second moments of the counting statistics to\noptimize the SNR. It does not directly rely on the Fisher\ninformation which is only available within the approximation that the entire counting statistics is Gaussian.\n\nIV.\n\n\u22121/4\nfactor\nthe scaling of the classical shot noise limit\n\u221a n\n1/ n. We emphasize that this limit is reached without\nthe need of any entanglement or squeezing of the system\nstate. Even more favorable scalings are found for strongly\ninteracting systems where the nonlinearity appears with\na different exponent in the GPE. In optical and atomic\ninterferometry, shorter wavelengths provide a better resolution of phase changes, and we can explain our result\nas a consequence of the high wave number content, i.e.,\nthe steepness, of the soliton dip. A similar improvement\ncould also be obtained by simply applying fast counterpropagating beams of atoms. We believe, however, that\nthe stability properties of solitons and the fact that there\nis no or only little net particle current makes this system suitable for interferometric investigations over longer\ntime scales compared to a thermal beam.\nWe have investigated the influence of quantum fluctuations with the help of Bogoliubov theory in the weakly\ninteracting case. The scaling law (n\u22123/4 ) remains stable,\nbut the prefactor is different. The Goldstone modes that\nare associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, in\nfact increase the sensitivity of the measurements. While\nsignal processing theory provides a theoretical limit for\nthe sensitivity (the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound), it generally does\nnot provide a method to achieve this limit. In our approach, we were able to find a nearly optimal filtering\nfunction, and showed with a signal-to-noise ratio analysis that it almost reaches the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors A.N. and K.M. acknowledge financial\nsupport from the European Union Integrated Project\nSCALA.

We used Bogoliubov theory, and we observed\nthat zero modes, due to the breaking of the U (1) and\ntranslation symmetries, makes quantitatively a significant change in the information content of the counting\ndistributions. We applied our theory to identify the ultimate information theoretical limits for position measurements of dark solitons and other topological excitations\nin a quasi one-dimensional and two-dimensional BoseEinstein condensate.\nIn the case of a pure condensate, where all particles occupy the same quantum state described by the GPE, the\nbest estimation of the soliton position has an uncertainty\nthat scales, for a weakly interacting system, as n\u22123/4\nwith the linear background density n. This beats by a\n\nAppendix A: EXCITATION MODES FOR A\nDARK SOLITON\n\nHere we sketch the derivation of the Bogoliubov eigenmodes for a system with a soliton in a box of length\n2 l. The analysis complements results given in Ref.[54].\nWe are looking for the eigenstates of the Bogoliubovde Gennes operator (39) with Vext (x) = 0. The background or condensate field is given by the wave function\n\u03a6 = \u03a6(x; q) of Eq.(19). We focus here on the stationary\ncase (soliton velocity \u03c5 = 0). Simple and compact expressions for the Bogoliubov eigenmodes can be found in\nthe limit l \u226b \u03be, when the soliton is located well within\nthe quantization box. The integral of |\u03a6(x; q)|2 over the\nbox gives the number of condensed atoms N0 :\nN0 = 2ln \u2212 2n/\u03ba\n\n(A1)\n\n\f13\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nvk (x)\n\nwhere the negative correction describes the atoms \"missing\"\n\u221a in the soliton notch. We have set \u03ba \u2261 \u03ba(\u03c5 = 0) =\n1/ 2\u03be. For the sake of simplicity in the notation, we\nshall hereafter drop the parametric dependence on q in\nthe order parameter \u03a6, the phonon modes uk , vk , and\nthe zero modes.\n\n0.1\n0\n\u22120.1\n\n1.\n\nPhonon modes\n\nFollowing the approach in Ref.[54, 57], we find that the\nmodes of L in a box with periodic boundary conditions\ncan be written as\n\u001b\n\u001a\nk\nuk (x)\nikx\nsech2 [\u03ba (x \u2212 q)]\n(A2)\n= Mk e\nvk (x)\n\u03ba\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nk\n+ i tanh[\u03ba (x \u2212 q)]\n,\n+ \u03b2k\u00b1\n2\u03ba\nwhere the upper [lower] sign applies to uk [vk ], respectively. Here, Mk is a normalisation constant [given in\nEq.(A6)],\n\u0012 \u00132\n2 Ek\nk\n,\n(A3)\n\u03b2k\u00b1 =\n\u00b1\n\u03ba\nm c2\nc is the speed of sound, and the phonon energy is given\nby\nr\nk2\nEk = h\u0304 c |k| 1 +\n.\n(A4)\n4 \u03ba2\nThis energy is the same as on a homogeneous background\ncondensate.\nThe presence of the soliton becomes manifest in the\ntotal phase shift of a phonon passing from the left to the\nright end of the box. It is given by 2 k l + \u2206\u03c6(k), where\n\u2206\u03c6(k) = 2 arctan(2 \u03ba/k) is due to the interaction with\nthe density notch. The quantisation condition for the\nwave number k is thus:\n2 kj l + \u2206\u03c6(kj ) = 2 \u03c0 j\n\nj = \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . (A5)\n\n[The case j = 0 is excluded because |2kl + \u2206\u03c6(k)| > \u03c0.]\nIn Sec.III B, sums over k are understood as running over\nthis discrete set of wavenumbers.\nFrom the normalization condition (41) for the phonon\nmodes, we obtain the normalization constant Mk\n\u001a \u0014 2\n\u0015\n\u001b\u22121/2\nr\n\u03ba\nk\n\u03bagn\nMk =\nl\u03ba\n+\n2\n\u2212\n1\n.

These k-values can be\ncompared to a free particle where kj = 0, 1, 2 (\u03c0/l).\n\nphase symmetry and translational symmetry by assigning a phase \u03b8 and a value of the displacement q to the\norder parameter \u03a6 respectively. In order to determine\nthe associated mode functions, we simply differentiate\nthe order parameter \u03a6 with respect to its global phase \u03b8\nor the parameter q, as described in Sec.III B and Ref.[54].\nWe obtain\n\nu\u03b8 (x) = \u03a6(x)\n\u221a\nuq (x) = \u2212i \u03ba n sech2 [\u03ba (x \u2212 q)]\n\n(A7)\n\nwith v\u03b1 (x) = \u2212u\u2217\u03b1 (x). We have chosen here \u03b8 = 0, i.e., a\nreal-valued \u03a6(x), otherwise the phase of uq (x) would be\ndifferent. With respect to the Bogoliubov scalar product\nEq.(41), the modes (A7) have zero norm and are mutually orthogonal. The zero modes are accompanied by\nadjoint vectors that satisfy Luad\n\u03b1 \u221d u\u03b1 and are found as\n\u03ba\n[\u03a6(x) + i x uq (x)] ,\n2 (N0 \u03ba + n)\n\u2212i\n\u221a .\nuad\nq (x) =\n4 n\nuad\n\u03b8 (x) =\n\n(A8)\n\nIn Fig.6 we show the first three eigenfunctions vj with\nj = 1, 2, 3, for q = 0.\n2.\n\nZero modes\n\nFor our quantum degenerate Bose gas the Goldstone\nmodes originate from the breaking of the global U (1)\n\nThey have zero norm because v\u03b1ad (x) = uad\u2217\n\u03b1 (x). The\nadjoint modes are mutually orthogonal with respect to\nEq.(41) which explains the presence of the second term\nin Eq.(A8). For the normalization and this extra term,\nwe consider the limit \u03ba l \u226b 1 and neglect exponentially\nsmall corrections.\n\n\f14\n\n[1] M. Vengalattore, J. M. Higbie, S. R. Leslie, J.
