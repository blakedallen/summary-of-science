The Riemann hypothesis, formulated in 1859 by Bernhard Riemann, states that the Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s) has all its nonreal zeros on\nthe line Re s = 1/2. Despite over a hundred years of considerable effort by\nnumerous mathematicians, this conjecture remains one of the most intriguing\nunsolved problems in mathematics. On the other hand, several analogues of\nthe Riemann hypothesis have been formulated and proved.\nIn this chapter, we discuss Enrico Bombieri's proof of the Riemann hypothesis for a curve over a finite field. This problem was formulated as a\nconjecture by Emil Artin in his thesis of 1924. Reformulated, it states that\nthe number of points on a curve C defined over the finite field with q ele\u221a\nments is of the order q + O( q). The first proof was given by Andr\u00e9 Weil\nin 1942. This proof uses the intersection of divisors on C \u00d7 C, making the\napplication to the original Riemann hypothesis so far unsuccessful, because\nspec Z \u00d7 spec Z = spec Z is one-dimensional. A new method of proof was found\nin 1969 by S. A. Stepanov. This method was greatly simplified and generalized\nby Bombieri in 1973.\nBombieri's proof uses functions on C \u00d7 C, again precluding a direct translation to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis itself. However, the two coordinates\non C \u00d7 C play different roles, one coordinate playing the geometric role of the\nvariable of a polynomial, and the other coordinate the arithmetic role of the\ncoefficients of this polynomial. The Frobenius automorphism of C acts on the\ngeometric coordinate of C \u00d7 C. In the last section, we make some suggestions\nhow Nevanlinna theory could provide a model for spec Z \u00d7 spec Z that is twodimensional and carries an action of Frobenius on the geometric coordinate.\nThe plan of this chapter is as follows. We first give a historical introduction\nto the Riemann hypothesis for a curve over a finite field and discuss some of\nthe proofs that have been given. In Section 2, we define the zeta function of the\ncurve. To prove the functional equation, we take a brief excursion to the twovariable zeta function of Pellikaan. In Section 3, we reformulate the Riemann\nhypothesis for \u03b6C (s), and give Bombieri's proof. In the last section, we compare\n\u03b6C (s) with the Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s), and describe the formalism of\nNevanlinna theory that might be a candidate for the framework of a translation\nof Bombieri's proof to the original Riemann hypothesis.\nKeywords: zeta function of a curve over a finite field, Riemann hypothesis\nfor a curve over a finite field, Frobenius flow, Nevanlinna theory.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Riemann zeta function is the function \u03b6(s), defined for Re s > 1 by the\ninfinite series\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b6(s) = 1 + s + s + s + . . . .\n(1.1)\n2\n3\n4\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

One can complete this function with the factor 'at\ninfinity' (related to the archimedean valuation on the real numbers),\n\u03b6R (s) = \u03c0 \u2212s/2 \u0393(s/2),\nto define the function \u03b6Z (s) = \u03b6R (s)\u03b6(s). This function is meromorphic on C with\nsimple poles at s = 0 and 1. It satisfies the functional equation\n\u03b6Z (1 \u2212 s) = \u03b6Z (s).\n\nThis is proved by Riemann [26] using the 'Riemann\u2013Roch'1 formula\n(1.2)\n\n\u03b8(t\u22121 ) = t\u03b8(t),\n\nP\u221e\n2 2\nwhere \u03b8(t) = n=\u2212\u221e e\u2212\u03c0n t is closely related to the classical theta-function. For\nRe s > 1, the zeta function satisfies the Euler product\nY\n1\n(1.3)\n,\n\u03b6Z (s) = \u03b6R (s)\n1\n\u2212\np\u2212s\np\nwhere the product is taken over all prime numbers. It follows that the zeros of \u03b6Z\nall lie in the vertical strip 0 \u2264 Re s \u2264 1.2 The Riemann hypothesis states that these\nzeros all lie on the line Re s = 1/2:\nRiemann hypothesis: \u03b6Z (s) = 0 implies Re s = 1/2.\nSee [26] and [10,13,22\u201324,28,35] for more information about the Riemann and other\nzeta functions.\nIn this exposition, we prove the Riemann hypothesis for the zeta function of a\ncurve over a finite field. Let q be a power of a prime number p, and let m(T, X) be\na polynomial in two variables with coefficients in Fq , the finite field with q elements.\nThe equation\nC : m(T, X) = 0\n\ndefines a curve C over Fq , which we assume to be nonsingular. Let NC (n) be the\nnumber of solutions of the equation m(t, x) = 0 in the finite set Fqn \u00d7 Fqn . Thus\nNC (n) is the number of points on C with coordinates in Fqn . A famous theorem of\nF. K. Schmidt of 1931 (see [31], [15, 16, 36], and (3.2) below) says that there exist\nan integer g, the genus of C, and algebraic numbers \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c92g , such that3\nNC (n) = q n \u2212\n\n2g\nX\n\n\u03c9\u03bdn + 1.\n\n\u03bd=1\n\nFrom the formula for NC (n), the Mellin transform (generating function),\nMNC (s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nNC (n)q \u2212ns ,\n\nn=1\n\n1This formula goes back to Cauchy and is called a Riemann\u2013Roch formula in Tate's thesis.\nP\n\u03c0in2 \u03c4 e2\u03c0iz , so that \u03b8(t) = \u03b8(0, it2 ).\nThe classical theta function is defined as \u03b8(z, \u03c4 ) = \u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e e\n2It is also known that the zeros do not lie on the boundary of this 'critical strip', see [19,\nTheorem 19, p. 58] and [37, Theorem 2.4].\n3In N (n), also the finitely many points 'at infinity' need to be counted.\nC\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n3\n\ncan be computed as a rational function of q \u2212s ,\n2g\n\n(1.4)\n\nX\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+\n.\nMNC (s) + 2 \u2212 2g =\n1 \u2212 q 1\u2212s \u03bd=1 1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bd q \u2212s\n1 \u2212 q \u2212s\n\nWe define the zeta function of C by\n\n\u03b6C (s) = q s(g\u22121)\n\nQ2g\n\n(1\n\n\u2212s\n)\n\u03bd=1 (1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bd q\n,\n1\u2212s\n\u2212 q )(1 \u2212 q \u2212s )\n\nso that MNC is recovered as its logarithmic derivative,\n(1.5)\n\n\u2212\n\n1 \u03b6C\u2032 (s)\n= MNC (s) + 1 \u2212 g.\nlog q \u03b6C (s)\n\nThe function \u03b6C satisfies the functional equation \u03b6C (1 \u2212 s) = \u03b6C (s). This functional\nequation can be proved using the Riemann\u2013Roch formula\n(1.6)\n\nl(D) = deg D + 1 \u2212 g + l(K \u2212 D),\n\nwhich is the analogue of (1.2) above. We will take a different approach and prove\nthe functional equation in Section 2.2.5 using the two-variable zeta function of\nPellikaan.\nClearly, \u03b6C is a rational function in q \u2212s , and hence periodic with period 2\u03c0i/ log q.\nIt has simple poles at s = 2k\u03c0i/ log q and s = 1+2k\u03c0i/ log q, and zeros at the points\ns = logq \u03c9\u03bd + 2k\u03c0i/ log q (\u03bd = 1, . . . , 2g, k \u2208 Z). It satisfies an Euler product,\nanalogous to (1.3), which converges for Re s > 1,\nY\n1\n\u03b6C (s) = q s(g\u22121)\n,\n\u2212s deg v\n1\n\u2212\nq\nv\n\nwhere the product is taken over all valuations of the function field of C. It follows\nthat 1 \u2264 |\u03c9\u03bd | \u2264 q. Artin4 conjectured that \u03b6C (s) has its zeros on the line Re s = 1/2.\nIn terms of the exponentials of the zeros, the numbers \u03c9\u03bd , this means that\n\u221a\nRiemann hypothesis for C: |\u03c9\u03bd | = q for every \u03bd = 1, . . . , 2g.\nIt is the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for \u03b6C . It is trivially verified for\nC = P1 , when g = 0 and \u03b6C does not have any zeros. It was proved by H. Hasse in\nthe case of elliptic curves (g = 1), and first in full generality by A. Weil,5 using the\nintersection of divisors with the graph of Frobenius in C\u00d7C, and, in his second proof,\nthe action of Frobenius on the embedding of C in its Jacobian (see [30, Appendix]).\nLater proofs, based on one of Weil's proofs, have been given by P. Roquette [29]\nand others. There have been some attempts to translate the first and second proof\nto the situation of the Riemann zeta function, when C is the 'curve' spec Z, but\nso far without success, one of the obstacles being that in the category of schemes,\nspec Z \u00d7 spec Z = spec Z is one-dimensional and not two-dimensional like C \u00d7 C\n(see [12]).\n4In his thesis [1], Artin only considers quadratic extensions of F (T ), that is, hyperelliptic\np\ncurves over Fp . Moreover, in his zeta functions the Euler factors corresponding to the points at\ninfinity are missing. Later, F. K. Schmidt [31] introduced the zeta function of a general projective\ncurve over an arbitrary finite field.\n5Weil announced his ideas in 1940 [39, 40] and explained them in 1942 in a letter to Artin [41].\nBut the complete proof (see [43, 44]) had to await the completion of his 'Foundations' [42].\n\n\f4\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nA completely new technique was discovered by Stepanov [33] in 1969, initially\nonly for hyperelliptic curves. W. M. Schmidt [32] used his method to reprove\nthe Riemann hypothesis for \u03b6C ,6 and a simplified proof was given by Bombieri\nin [3] (see also [5]). Bombieri's proof uses the graph of Frobenius in C \u00d7 C and\nthe Riemann\u2013Roch formula.7 When Bombieri was studying Stepanov's proof, in\norder to understand the derivations in a geometric way, he used a standard connection on the curve. The argument worked only over the prime field because of\nthe obstruction arising from iterating the connection p times. However, Bombieri\nfound that derivatives of order p gave the Cartier operator, which turned out to\nbe the same as taking the p-th power of the function. Thus the final proof does\nnot mention connections nor the Cartier operator, and fits on a paper napkin [4].\nWe present this proof in Section 3. A shorter exposition of Bombieri's proof has\nappeared in [38].\nIt is interesting to see the development in these proofs. Gradually, more geometry\nthat cannot be translated to the number field case has been taken out. The question\narises as to what exactly is needed to prove the Riemann hypothesis for curves, and\nwhat we can learn from this about the Riemann hypothesis for spec Z.\nWeil's first proof uses the geometry of C \u00d7 C, and in particular the intersection\nof the graph of Frobenius with the diagonal. There is some reason to believe that\nno analogue will ever exist for number fields, or else, that constructing an analogue\nis harder than establishing the Riemann hypothesis. His second proof uses the\nJacobian of C, and again, no analogue may ever be constructed for the integers.\nBombieri's proof uses very little of the geometry of C \u00d7C, but it uses the action of\nFrobenius and Riemann\u2013Roch. Since Tate's thesis, it is known that the Riemann\u2013\nRoch equality (1.6) translates into formula (1.2). Bombieri's proof naturally divides\ninto two steps. In the first step, he uses the action of Frobenius to obtain a discrete\nflow on the curve (here called the Frobenius flow ), which he analyzes to obtain an\nupper bound for the number of points on the curve, which is a weak form of the\nprime number theorem for the curve (see Table 4.1). One sees that the horizontal\ncoordinate of C \u00d7 C plays an 'arithmetic' role, and the vertical coordinate plays\na 'geometric' role (see Remark 3.3). In the second step, he uses the Riemann\nhypothesis for P1 , and the fact that the Frobenius automorphism generates the\nlocal Galois group (decomposition group) at a point on the curve, to obtain a lower\nbound for the number of points on the curve. Combining the two steps, he first\nobtains the analogue of the prime number theorem with a good error term, and\nfrom this it is a small step to deduce the Riemann hypothesis (see Lemma 3.1).\nTherefore, one might conclude that the right approach to the Riemann hypothesis\nis to first prove the prime number theorem with a good bound for the error term.\nLooking at the first step of Bombieri's proof, one might even believe that the key\nto a prime number theorem with a good error bound is to construct a function\n(possibly a Fourier or Dirichlet polynomial, in the spirit of the methods of Baker,\nGelfond and Schneider) that vanishes at the first N primes to a high order. If one\ncould bound the degree of this polynomial, one would obtain an upper bound for\nthe number of primes. This would already imply the Riemann hypothesis, so the\nsecond step becomes unnecessary. In Section 4 we make some speculations about\nhow to translate Bombieri's proof to number theory.\n6The extension of Stepanov's proof to a general F by W. M. Schmidt uses hyperderivations.\nq\n\n7Bombieri does not mention C \u00d7 C, but he uses F\u0304 (C) \u2297 F\u0304 (C), i.e., functions on C \u00d7 C.\np\np\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n5\n\nRemark 1.1. Recently, Alain Connes found a completely new method again [6],\nbased on the work of Shai Haran [13, 14], using harmonic analysis on the ring of\nadeles. Connes conjectures that Weil's explicit formula is obtained as the trace\nof a certain shift operator, and then establishes the positivity of this trace, thus\nproving the Riemann hypothesis for spec Z and for all L-functions associated with\na Gr\u00f6ssencharakter, up to a 'lemma' about special functions. He does not use the\naction of Frobenius. (See however Remark 4.1.)\n2. The Zeta Function of a Curve over a Finite Field\nThroughout, we fix a function field K of transcendence degree one over a finite\nfield of characteristic p. We assume that the algebraic closure of Fp in K, i.e., the\nfield of constants of K, is Fq , and we choose a function T \u2208 K such that K is a\nfinite separable extension of the field of rational functions Fq (T ), which we denote\nby q,\nq = Fq (T ).\nThus,\nK = q[X]/(m(T, X))\nfor some polynomial m, irreducible over the algebraic closure F\u0304p .\nThe Frobenius Flow. Geometrically, K is the field of functions on a curve C given\nby m(T, X) = 0, and the choice of T corresponds to the choice of a projection\nof C onto P1 . Adding extra coordinates T, X, Y, . . . if necessary, we can obtain a\nnonsingular model for C.\nValuations of K correspond to orbits of points on C in the following way. The\nFrobenius automorphism acts on algebraic points in C(F\u0304p ) by raising each coordinate of a point to the q-th power,\n\u03c6q : (t, x, y, . . . ) 7\u2192 (tq , xq , y q , . . . ).\nThis action of Frobenius induces a discrete dynamical system on C(F\u0304p ), which we\ncall the Frobenius flow on C (see Figure 3.1). So a point in C(Fqn ) that is not defined\nover a smaller field of constants gives an orbit of this flow of n points. We normalize\nthe corresponding valuation of K so that v(f ) equals the order of vanishing of f at\nany one of the points in this orbit.\n2.1. The Local Theory. For the local theory of the zeta function, our exposition closely follows Tate's thesis [35]. The completion of K at a valuation v is\ndenoted Kv . As is well known, Kv is locally compact. It contains the ring Ov of\nfunction elements regular at v, which has a single prime ideal\n\u03c0v Ov\nof functions vanishing at v. Here, \u03c0v is any function that has a simple zero at v.\nThe residue class field\nK(v) = Ov /\u03c0v Ov\n\nis a finite extension of Fq . We denote its degree over Fq by deg v. This is also the\nlength of the corresponding orbit of the Frobenius flow. We write\nqv = q deg v = |K(v)|\n\n\f6\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nfor the cardinality of K(v). By our normalization of the valuations of K, we\nhave v(\u03c0v ) = 1. The associated norm is\n|\u03b1|v = qv\u2212v(\u03b1) .\n\n2.1.1. Additive Characters and Measure. Denote by Kv+ the additive group of Kv ,\nas a locally compact commutative group, and by \u03be its general element. The character group of Kv+ is determined by the following lemma:\nLemma 2.1 ([35, Lemma 2.2.1]). If \u03be 7\u2192 \u03c7(\u03be) is one nontrivial character of Kv+ ,\nthen for each \u03b7 \u2208 Kv+ , \u03be 7\u2192 \u03c7(\u03b7\u03be) is also a character of Kv+ . The correspondence\n\u03b7 \u2190\u2192 \u03c7(\u03b7\u03be) is an isomorphism, both topological and algebraic, between Kv+ and its\ncharacter group.\nTo fix the identification of Kv+ with its character group promised by this lemma,\nwe must construct a special nontrivial character. We first construct additive characters for q = Fq (T ). The restriction of v to q is either a multiple of a P -adic\nvaluation, for an irreducible polynomial P , or a multiple of v\u221e , the valuation at\ninfinity, corresponding to P (T ) = 1/T . Let qP be the completion of q at P . Thus\neach element of qP is a Laurent series of terms aT k P n , for a \u2208 Fq , 0 \u2264 k < deg P\n(k = 0 if P = 1/T ), with only finitely many terms with a negative power of P .\nRecall that the characteristic of q is p. We identify Fp with Z/pZ, so that for\nt \u2208 Fp , the rational number t/p is well defined modulo Z. Define a character \u03c7P\non qP as follows: If P (T ) = 1/T , then\n(\n1 \u0010\nn\n\u0011 if n 6= \u22121\n(2.1)\n\u03c7\u221e (aT ) =\n2\u03c0i\nif n = \u22121,\nexp \u2212 p TrFq /Fp (a)\n\nwhere TrFq /Fp (a) denotes the trace of a \u2208 Fq over Fp = Z/pZ. If P (T ) is an\nirreducible monic polynomial of degree d with coefficients in Fq , then we put for\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 d \u2212 1 and a \u2208 Fq ,\n(\n1 \u0010\n\u0011 if n 6= \u22121 or 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d \u2212 2\n\u03c7P (aT k P n ) =\n(2.2)\n2\u03c0i\nexp p TrFq /Fp (a)\nif n = \u22121 and k = d \u2212 1.\nSee [35, Lemma 2.2.2] for a proof of the following lemma.\n\nLemma 2.2. \u03be 7\u2192 \u03c7P (\u03be) is a nontrivial, continuous additive map of qP into the\nunit circle group.\nUnlike in the number field case, it is not true that \u03c7P (\u03be) = 1 if and only if \u03be is a\nP -adic integer. In fact, \u03c7P depends only on the coefficient of 1/P (or of 1/T at the\ninfinite valuation). We will see the geometric meaning of \u03c7P and \u03c7\u221e by relating it\nto a residue.\nLemma 2.3. Let P be an irreducible monic polynomial of degree d with coefficients\nin Fq . Let q(P ) be the residue class field Fq [T ]/(P ).

The roots of Pe then reduce to\nthe roots ti modulo a prime ideal above p in the splitting field of Pe . Since the roots\nof P are all distinct, so are those of Pe . The lemma now follows from the following\nmore general lemma, which asserts that the required equality already holds without\ntaking the class in Fq .\n\u0003\nLemma 2.4.

Lemma 2.3 is due to Euler. See [2, p. 90] or the proof of [34, Theorem\nIII.5.10, p. 97] for a more elementary proof.\nApplying Lemma 2.3 to Definition (2.2), we may write for n \u2265 \u22121,\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u0013\n2\u03c0i\nP\nk n\n\u03c7P (aT k P n ) = exp\naT\nP\n+\n(P\n)\n.\nTrFq /Fp Trq(P )/Fq\np\nP\u2032\n\nIn this formula, we do not need to assume anymore that P is monic.

In general, \u0393r z k mn (z) dz/2\u03c0i vanishes for n 6= \u22121, if \u0393r encircles\nevery root of m. This follows for n \u2264 \u22122 by the same limit argument as in the\nproof of Lemma 2.4, and for n \u2265 0, it follows since the integrand is holomorphic.\nTherefore, we could write the character symbolically as\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012I\n\u0012\ndT\n2\u03c0i\n,\nTrFq /Fp\n\u03be\n\u03c7P (\u03be) = exp\np\n2\u03c0i\nP\nwhere the notation indicates that all the roots of the polynomial P are to be\nencircled. This motivates the following definition.\n\nDefinition 2.7.

In\nSection 2.2.2 we will see that v kv v is a canonical divisor of the curve C.\n\nLet \u03bc be a Haar measure for Kv+ . As in [35, Lemmas 2.2.4 and 2.2.5], for a\nmeasurable set M in Kv+ and \u03b1 6= 0 in Kv ,\n\u03bc(\u03b1M ) = |\u03b1|v \u03bc(M ).\n\nThis explains our choice of normalization for the absolute value: the norm |\u03b1|v is\nthe factor by which the additive group Kv+ is stretched under the transformation\n\u03be 7\u2192 \u03b1\u03be. For the integral, this means that\nZ\nZ\nf (\u03be) \u03bc(d\u03be) = |\u03b1|v\nf (\u03b1\u03be) \u03bc(d\u03be).\nKv+\n\nKv+\n\nLet us now select a fixed Haar measure for the additive group Kv+ . Theorem 2.8\nenables us to do this in an invariant way by selecting the measure which is its own\nFourier transform under the interpretation of Kv+ as its own character group established in that theorem. We state the choice of measure which does this, writing dv \u03be\ninstead of \u03bc(d\u03be) and qv = q deg v . Define\ndv \u03be = that measure for which Ov gets measure qv\u2212kv /2 .\nThe Fourier transform is defined for integrable functions, and the inversion formula holds for integrable continuous functions for which the Fourier transform is\nalso integrable.

Given \u03b7 6\u2208 OP , say \u03b7 = n=\u2212N yn P for some N > 0\nand y\u2212N 6= 0, we can find an element\n\u03be = xP N \u22121 \u2208 OP such that \u03c7P (\u03b7\u03be) is not\nR\ntrivial. Therefore, the integral OP \u03c7P (\u03b7\u03be) dP \u03be vanishes for \u03b7 6\u2208 OP , and by our\nchoice of Haar measure, it equals 1 for \u03b7 \u2208 OP . Therefore, p0P is its own Fourier\ntransform.\nFor the valuation at infinity, we find similarly that the indicator function p1\u221e of\nthe maximal ideal T \u22121 O\u221e is its own Fourier transform.\n2.1.2. Multiplicative Characters and Measure. Our first insight into the structure\nof the multiplicative group Kv\u2217 of Kv is given by the continuous homomorphism\n\u03b1 7\u2192 |\u03b1|v of Kv\u2217 into the multiplicative group of powers of qv = q deg v . The kernel\nof this homomorphism, the subgroup of all \u03b1 with |\u03b1|v = 1, is denoted by Ov\u2217 . This\ngroup is compact and open.\n\n\f10\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nConcerning the characters of Kv\u2217 , the situation is different from that of Kv+ .\nIndeed, we are interested in all continuous multiplicative maps of Kv\u2217 into the\ncomplex numbers, not only the bounded ones, and shall call such a map a quasicharacter. We call a quasi-character unramified if it is trivial on Ov\u2217 . The reader\nmay find in [35, Section 2.3] a (partial) description of the characters of Ov\u2217 . We will\nonly be concerned with unramified characters.\nLemma 2.12. The unramified quasi-characters are the maps of the form\n|\u03b1|sv = qv\u2212sv(\u03b1) ,\nwhere s is determined modulo 2\u03c0i/ log qv .\nAs in [35, Section 2.3], we will be able to select a Haar measure d\u2217v \u03b1 on Kv\u2217 by\nrelating it to the measure dv \u03be on Kv+ . We will need a multiplicative Haar measure\nthat gives the subgroup Ov\u2217 unit measure.8 To this effect we choose as our standard\nHaar measure on Kv\u2217 :\nk /2\n\nd\u2217v \u03b1 =\n\ndv \u03b1\nqv v\n\u22121 |\u03b1| .\n1 \u2212 qv\nv\n\nSince Ov = Ov\u2217 \u222a \u03c0v Ov is a disjoint union, we obtain\nLemma 2.13.

Since the different dv/P is nontrivial for only finitely many v,\nit follows that AK is its own character group via the identification x 7\u2192 \u03c7(yx) of an\nadele y with a character on the adeles.\nThe Fourier transform of an integrable function f on the adeles is defined by\nZ\n\u03c7(yx)f (x)dx.\nF f (y) =\nAK\n\nNote that the Fourier transform is almost an involution: F Ff (x) = f (\u2212x) for every\ncontinuous integrable function for which the Fourier transform is also integrable.\nWe get an additive fundamental domain AK /K of unit volume. Note that AK /K\ncan be identified with a subgroup of AK , unlike in the number field case (see\nalso [35, Lemma 4.1.4]).\nExample 2.14. We compute A/q for q = Fq (T ) by a procedure reminiscent of the\ncomputation of the partial fraction decomposition (see Lemma 2.15 below). Let x\nbe an adele. For each finite P -adic valuation, substract a rational function of the\nform f /P k to cancel the denominator of x. Thus we can substract an element\nof q so that each finite component of x becomes a regular function in OP . Then\nwe can still substract a polynomial from the infinite component of x, so that this\ncomponent can be brought into T \u22121 O\u221e .

This explains our particular choice of local characters. To show this, we\nfirst need a lemma.\nLemma 2.15. A rational function f has a partial fraction decomposition,\n(2.7)\n\nf (T ) =\n\nX\n\nP : vP (f )<0\n\n\u2212vP (f )\n\nX\n\nfP,n (T )P \u2212n + f\u221e (T ),\n\nn=1\n\nwhere each fP,n is a polynomial in T of degree less than deg P, and f\u221e is a polynomial in T .\nProof. Let P be an irreducible polynomial such that vP (f ) < 0. Thus, P is a factor\nof the denominator of f . Let n be the exponent of P in the denominator. Compute\nthe class of P n f modulo P . Thus we find a polynomial fP,n of degree less than\ndeg P such that f \u2212 fP,n P \u2212n has the same factors in its denominator as f , to the\nsame power, except that P occurs to a lower power. We continue until\nX\nf\u2212\nfP,n P \u2212n\nhas a trivial denominator, and hence is a polynomial f\u221e (T ).\n\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nLemma 2.16. For every \u03be \u2208 K we have \u03c7(\u03be) = 1.\nProof. We prove this directly for K = q. It then follows in general from the\ndefinition of \u03c7v .\nLet \u03be \u2208 q be a rational function, and compute the partial fraction decomposition\nof \u03be. We show that each term in (2.7) contributes trivially to \u03c7(\u03be).\nFirst, for an irreducible polynomial Q, \u03c7Q (f\u221e ) = 1. Also \u03c7\u221e (f\u221e ) = 1 since f\u221e\ndoes not have a 1/T -term. Hence \u03c7(f\u221e ) = 1.\nLet\nfP,n P \u2212n\nbe a term in the partial fraction decomposition of \u03be and assume n \u2265 2. Then\n\u03c7Q (fP,n P \u2212n ) = 1 for Q 6= P and for Q = P since n \u2265 2. Also \u03c7\u221e (fP,n P \u2212n ) = 1,\nsince the degree of fP,n P \u2212n is at most deg P \u2212 1 \u2212 n deg P \u2264 \u22122.\nFinally, a term fP,1 /P does not contribute in \u03c7Q for every irreducible polynomial\nQ 6= P . Assume that P is monic and write\nfP,1 (T ) = a0 + a1 T + * * * + ad\u22121 T d\u22121,\n\nwhere d = deg P and ai \u2208 Fq . The contribution of \u03c7P is obtained from the\ntrace over Fp of ad\u22121 . Further, for i \u2264 d \u2212 2, \u03c7\u221e (ai T i /P ) = 1 because this\nrational function has degree \u2264 \u22122. Also, ad\u22121 T d\u22121 /P = ad\u22121 /T + O(T \u22122 ), since P\nis monic. Hence the contribution of \u03c7\u221e is obtained from the trace over Fp of \u2212ad\u22121 ,\nwhich cancels the contribution of \u03c7P . It follows that \u03c7(\u03be) = 1.\n\u0003\nAs in [35, Theorem 4.1.4], it follows that the group of characters that are trivial\non K is K \u22a5 = K.\n2.2.2. The Theorem of Riemann\u2013Roch. From the Poisson Summation Formula [35,\nLemma 4.2.4], we deduce the theorem of Riemann\u2013Roch [35, Theorem 4.2.1],\nX\n1 X\nF f (\u03be/a),\nf (\u03bea) =\n|a|\n\u03be\u2208K\n\n\u03be\u2208K\n\nwhere the norm of the idele a is defined by\nY\n|a| =\n(2.8)\n|av |v .\nv\n\nDefinition 2.17. We define the average of f by\nX\np\nf (\u03b1a).\nEf (a) = |a|\n\u03b1\u2208K \u2217\n\nMore precisely, E is the combination of a restriction (to the ideles) and a trace\n(the sum over K \u2217 ) [7]. It is not a true average over K \u2217 , because this set is infinite.\nIn terms of the average, the theorem of Riemann\u2013Roch reads\n(2.9)\n\nEf (a) + f (0)|a|1/2 = E(F f )(1/a) + F f (0)|a|\u22121/2 .\n\nRemark 2.18. Clearly, E(F Ff ) = Ef , so that the Fourier transform induces an\ninvolution on the image of the averaging map, even though it is not itself an involution. This is because the averages of f (x) and f (\u2212x) coincide. In general, the\naverages of f (x) and f (\u03b1x) coincide, for any \u03b1 \u2208 K \u2217 . Thus the average of f only\ndepends on the class of the idele a in A\u2217 /K \u2217 . If f only depends on the associated\ndivisor, then Ef (D) depends only on the class of D and on its degree.\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\nP\n\nA divisor is a formal sum D =\npositive,\n\nv\n\n13\n\nDv v, with Dv \u2208 Z.

Since 1/|a| = q deg D , we obtain the theorem\nof Riemann\u2013Roch in the classical formulation:\nTheorem 2.20. Let C be a curve of genus g with field of constant functions Fq .\nLet K be a canonical divisor on C and let D be a divisor. The vector space over Fq\nof functions f such that (f ) + D is positive has dimension l(D) given by\nl(D) = deg D + 1 \u2212 g + l(K \u2212 D).\nIt follows that g is an integer (hence the degree of K is even). For D = 0 we have\nL(0) = Fq and hence l(0) = 1. Putting D = 0 in the Riemann\u2013Roch formula, we\nfind g = l(K), so that g \u2265 0. See [2, 34] for the connection with differentials on C.\nExample 2.21. By the computation of kv for q, we see that the canonical divisor\nof P1 has degree \u22122, hence P1 has genus 0.\nExample 2.22. A curve of genus 1 always has a rational point. Indeed, by Theorem 2.27 below, we can find a divisor D of degree 1. By Riemann\u2013Roch, l(D) = 1,\nhence D is linearly equivalent (see Definition 2.23 below) to a positive divisor of\ndegree 1, which is a point on C.\nSimilarly, a curve of genus 0 always has a rational point.\n2.2.3. Multiplicative Theory. The multiplicative group of AK is A\u2217K , the group of\nideles. It is the multiplicative group of vectors (av ), av \u2208 Kv\u2217 , such that av \u2208 Ov\u2217\nfor almost all v. It contains the subgroup\nA\u22170 = ker | * |\nof ideles of degree zero. A\u22170 is a refinement of the group of divisors of degree zero,\nand A\u22170 /K \u2217 is a refinement of the ideal class group of K. By Lemma 2.13, the\nmeasure\nY\nd\u2217 a =\nd\u2217v av\n\u2217\n\non A gives the subgroup\n\nQ\n\n\u2217\nv Ov\n\nv\n\nof\n\nA\u22170\n\nunit measure.\n\nDefinition 2.23. Two divisors D and D\u2032 are linearly equivalent if D \u2212 D\u2032 is the\ndivisor of a function on C.\nThus D + (\u03b1) gives all divisors equivalent to D, for \u03b1 \u2208 K \u2217 . By Remark 2.19,\nlinearly equivalent divisors have the same degree. We write Cl(n) for the set of\nlinear equivalence classes of divisors of degree n. Thus Cl(0) is a group, the divisor\nclass group of C. Let P be a divisor of degree n. Then D 7\u2192 P + D gives a bijection\nbetween the classes of degree 0 and of degree n. Thus if Cl(n) is not empty, then\nthe number of classes in Cl(n) equals that of Cl(0). We will see in Theorem 2.27\nbelow that there exist divisors of every degree, so Cl(n) is never empty. We write\nh = |Cl(0)|\nfor the class number of C over Fq .\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n15\n\nExample 2.24. Let C be a curve of genus 0 and let D be a divisor of degree zero.\nBy the Riemann\u2013Roch formula, l(D) \u2265 1, hence there exists a function f such that\n(f ) + D \u2265 0. Since the degree of this divisor is zero, we have that D = (1/f ). This\nshows that h = 1.\nIn general, let D be a divisor of degree zero such that l(D) \u2265 1. Then there\nexists a function f such that D + (f ) \u2265 0, so that D is linearly equivalent to the\ntrivial divisor. Then l(D) = 1, since nonconstant functions always have poles. On\nthe other hand, l(D) = 0 for every nontrivial divisor class of degree zero.\nTheorem 2.25. The number of linear equivalence classes in each degree is finite.\nProof. For deg D \u2265 g we have l(D) \u2265 1 + l(K \u2212 D) \u2265 1. Hence there exists\na function \u03b1 such that D + (\u03b1) \u2265 0. It follows that the class of a divisor of\ndegree \u2265 g is represented by a positive divisor. Since there are only finitely many\nvaluations of each degree, the number of elements of Cl(n) is finite for n \u2265 g. But\n|Cl(0)| = |Cl(n)| if Cl(n) is not empty, so h is finite.\n\u0003\nThe volume of the group of idele classes A\u22170 /K \u2217 is found as follows: Choose ideles\nc1 , . . . , ch of degree zero representing each class. Given an idele of degree 0, we can\nfirst divide by a ci to make its class trivial. Then we can divide by a function to\nmake it a unit everywhere, and finally, we can divide by a constant function in F\u2217q\nto make the value of this unit 1 at one fixed valuation of degree 1, or, if such a\nvaluation does\nexist, we can normalize the idele in a similar manner using F\u2217q .\nQ not\n\u2217\nThe group v Ov has unit volume. Also, F\u2217q contains q \u2212 1 elements. Hence the\nvolume of A\u22170 /K \u2217 , denoted \u03ba, is given by\nh\n(2.13)\n.\n\u03ba = vol(A\u22170 /K \u2217 ) =\nq\u22121\nUnlike the number field case, A\u22170 /K \u2217 can be identified with a subgroup of A\u22170 , even\nif there is more than one valuation above infinity.

As in [35], for a function f on the adeles such that f\nand F f are of fast decay as |a| \u2192 \u221e, the zeta function is defined for Re s > 1 by\nZ\n(2.14)\n\u03b6C (f, s) =\nf (a)|a|s d\u2217 a.\nA\u2217\n\nThis definition is not natural, since we integrate the additive function f over the\nmultiplicative group A\u2217 .

The factor q (g\u22121)s has been inserted so that the functional equation is self-dual, see Section 2.2.5. By (2.17), this\nfunction can be written for Re s > 1 as a sum over positive divisors,\nX\n\u03b6C (s) = q (g\u22121)s\nq \u2212s deg D .\nD\u22650\n\nThis is the analogue of (1.1).

Then Cl(n) is empty if n is not\na multiple of \u03bc, hence (2.19) only contains terms with n a multiple of \u03bc. For a\ndivisor D of degree n \u2265 2g \u2212 1, l(D) = n + 1 \u2212 g. Hence the infinite series (2.19)\nbecomes geometric. We thus find that \u03b6C has simple poles at the values for s such\nthat q \u03bcs = q \u03bc and at values such that q \u03bcs = 1. To finish the computation, we first\nshow that there exists a divisor of degree 1 (see [34] or [11, V.5.3]).\nConstant Field Extensions. Recall that Fq is the field of constants of K, i.e., Fq is\nalgebraically closed in K. We denote the constant field extension of degree n by\nKn = K[X]/(m),\nwhere m is an irreducible polynomial over Fq of degree n. The corresponding\nzeta function (without the q (g\u22121)s factor) is defined by its Euler product over all\nvaluations w of Kn ,\nY\n1\n\u03b6C/Fqn (s) =\n(2.20)\n\u2212s .\n1 \u2212 qw\nw\n\nThe Frobenius automorphism of Fqn is \u03c6nq , hence the Frobenius flow of C/Fqn\nis generated by \u03c6nq . Let w be a valuation of Kn . Its restriction to K, say v,\ncorresponds to an orbit of \u03c6q of deg v points in C(F\u0304p ). Under \u03c6nq , this orbit splits\ninto d orbits, each of deg(v)/d points, where\nd = gcd(n, deg v).\n\n10By Theorem 2.27, we could also take f = Q pav , where the exponents a are chosen so\nv\nv v\n\nthat\n\nP\n\nv\n\nav deg v = 1 \u2212 g, to define \u03b6C (s) = \u03b6C (f, s), without the need of the factor q (g\u22121)s .\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n17\n\nHence deg w = deg(v)/d, i.e., Kn (w) has degree deg(v)/d over Fqn , and hence\ndegree n/d over K(v). This means that\nqw = qvn/d .\nMoreover, there are d different valuations of Kn that restrict to v. We find that\nthe local factor corresponding to v in the Euler product for \u03b6C/Fqn (s) is given by\nY\n1\n1\n\u0011d .\n\u2212s = \u0010\n1 \u2212 qw\n\u2212ns/d\nw|v\n1 \u2212 qv\n\nNow deg(v)/d is relatively prime to n/d.

Hence, by (2.20),\n\u03b6C/Fq (s) has period 2\u03c0i / \u03bc log q. By Lemma 2.26, we find that \u03b6C/Fq\u03bc (s) has a pole\nof order \u03bc at s = 1. Since this pole is simple, we find that \u03bc = 1. We have proven\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 2.27. There exists a divisor on C of degree 1.\nExample 2.28. The curve X 2 + Y 2 + 1 = 0 has no point over the rational numbers,\nand every divisor consists of at least two points. Indeed, every divisor defined over\nthe rational numbers or the real numbers has an even degree. By the last theorem,\nwe cannot have a similar situation over a finite field.\nWe finish the computation of \u03b6C . For C = P1 , i.e., genus zero, l(D) = n + 1 for\nn = deg D \u2265 0.

A Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis for C\n3.1. Points on C. Every valuation of K corresponds to deg v points on C defined\nover the finite field K(v). Let NC (n) be the number of points on C with values\nin Fqn . Since K(v) is a subfield of Fqn if and only if deg v | n, we find that\nX\n(3.1)\ndeg v.\nNC (n) =\ndeg v|n\n\nBy (2.18), we have\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u03b6C\u2032\n(s) = 1 \u2212 g +\nq \u2212ns NC (n).\nlog q \u03b6C\nn=1\n\nOn the other hand, taking the logarithmic derivative of the expression (2.22) of \u03b6C\nas a rational function of q \u2212s , we find by (2.23)\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u0001\n1 \u03b6C\u2032\nn\n+1 .\n(s) = 1 \u2212 g +\nq \u2212ns q n \u2212 \u03c91n \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c92g\nlog q \u03b6C\nn=1\n\nComparing coefficients, we obtain\n(3.2)\n\nn\nNC (n) = q n \u2212 \u03c91n \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c92g\n+ 1.\n\nRecall that the Riemann hypothesis for C can be formulated as |\u03c9\u03bd | \u2264\n\u03bd = 1, . . . , 2g. It follows from the Riemann hypothesis that\n\n\u221a\nq for\n\n|NC (n) \u2212 q n \u2212 1| \u2264 2gq n/2 .\n\nConversely, we have the following lemma, which states in particular that it suffices\nto prove (3.3) for all even n.\nLemma 3.1. If for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a natural number m such that the\ninequality\n(3.3)\n\n|NC (nm) \u2212 q nm \u2212 1| \u2264 Bq nm(1/2+\u03b5)\n\nis satisfied for every n, then the Riemann hypothesis holds for \u03b6C .\nProof. Let \u03b5 > 0. By Diophantine approximation, we can find infinitely many n\nsuch that Re \u03c9\u03bdnm \u2265 21 |\u03c9\u03bd |nm for \u03bd = 1, . . . , 2g. Then\n\n1\nmax |\u03c9\u03bd |nm .\n2 \u03bd\nLetting n \u2192 \u221e, we find that |\u03c9\u03bd | \u2264 q 1/2+\u03b5 for every \u03bd. Since this holds for every\n\u03b5 > 0, we obtain |\u03c9\u03bd | \u2264 q 1/2 . By Remark 2.29, we conclude that |\u03c9\u03bd | = q 1/2 for\nevery \u03bd.\n\u0003\n|NC (nm) \u2212 q nm \u2212 1| \u2265\n\n3.2. The Graph of the Frobenius Flow. Figure 3.1 depicts the graph\nY = \u03c6q (X)\nof one step of the Frobenius flow in C \u00d7 C. The intersection with the diagonal\n\u2206: Y = X\n\ngives the points (x, x) with \u03c6q (x) = x. These are the points on C defined over Fq ,\nand their number is NC (1). We assume that there is at least one point on the\nintersection, which we denote by (\u221e, \u221e). We write v\u221e for the corresponding\nvaluation of degree 1 of K.\n\n\f20\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nC\n\n\u03c6q\n\n\u2206\n\u221e\n\nC\n\nFigure 3.1. The graph of Frobenius intersected with the diagonal.\nRemark 3.2. The Frobenius automorphism is smooth, since it is a polynomial map.\nAlso, its derivative vanishes, so our intuition says that this map should be constant,\nor at least locally constant. Being a polynomial of degree q, it seems to be a q-toone map, but in fact, it is one-to-one. Figure 3.1 emphasizes the smoothness and\nignores the injectivity of the Frobenius flow.\nThe functions defined over Fq with a pole of order at most m at \u221e and no other\npoles form an Fq -vector space Lm = L(m(\u221e)). By Theorem 2.20, the dimension\nof Lm is\nlm = l(m(\u221e)) = m + 1 \u2212 g + l(K \u2212 m(\u221e)).\n\nWe find\n(3.4)\n\nm + 1 \u2212 g \u2264 lm \u2264 m + 1,\n\nand\n(3.5)\n\nlm = m + 1 \u2212 g for m > 2g \u2212 2.\n\nClearly, Lm+1 contains Lm as a subspace. Also, lm+1 \u2264 lm + 1, since for two\nfunctions f and g in Lm+1 for which f 6\u2208 Lm , we can find a constant \u03bb \u2208 Fq such\nthat g \u2212 \u03bbf \u2208 Lm . Let\ns1 , . . . , slm\nbe a basis for Lm such that v\u221e (si+1 ) < v\u221e (si ), i.e., the order of the pole of si at \u221e\nincreases with i. Given k \u2265 0, we choose coefficients ai \u2208 Lk to form\nf (X, Y ) =\n\nlm\nX\ni=1\n\nai (X)si (Y ).\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n21\n\nRemark 3.3. For C = P1 , s1 (Y ) = 1, s2 (Y ) = Y , s3 (Y ) = Y 2 , . . . , and f (X, Y ) is\na polynomial in Y with coefficients in X, which we will assume to be of low degree\nin X. This is analogous to a polynomial in Y with integer coefficients. Therefore,\nwe call Y the 'geometric' coordinate, and X the 'arithmetic' coordinate.\nWe thus obtain a space of functions f (X, Y ) on C \u00d7 C defined over Fq . The\nrestriction of f (X, Y ) to the graph of Frobenius is\nf|\u03c6 (X) = f (X, \u03c6q (X)).\nThe map f 7\u2192 f|\u03c6 is Fq -linear. Note that si (\u03c6q (X)) = sqi (X), since si is defined\nover Fq . Hence f|\u03c6 \u2208 Lk+qm .\nLemma 3.4. For k < q, the map f 7\u2192 f|\u03c6 is injective, and hence an isomorphism\nonto its image.\nPm\nProof. Assume f 7\u2192 f|\u03c6 = 0. That is, li=1\nai sqi = 0. Consider the order of the\nq\npole at \u221e. If ai 6= 0, then v\u221e (ai si ) \u2264 qv\u221e (si ) \u2264 \u2212q + qv\u221e (sj ) for every j < i.\nFurther, v\u221e (aj sqj ) \u2265 \u2212k + qv\u221e (sj ) > \u2212q + qv\u221e (sj ). Hence the pole of the nonzero\nterm of highest order in f|\u03c6 is not cancelled by the pole of any of the other terms.\nIt follows that the highest nonzero term vanishes. We conclude that there is no\nhighest nonzero term, and hence f = 0.\n\u0003\nWe take the coefficients ai to be p\u03bc -th powers, for p\u03bc < q, so that f|\u03c6 is a p\u03bc -th\npower. Hence the coefficients are of the form\n\u03bc\n\nai = bpi .\nWe choose bi \u2208 Ln , so that ai \u2208 Lp\u03bc n . To be able to apply Lemma 3.4, we assume\nthat\np\u03bc n < q.\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe can also restrict f to the diagonal:\nf|\u2206 (X) = f (X, X).\nWe obtain the two restriction maps, for k < q,\nf \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 f|\u2206\nf|\u03c6\nwhere the vertical equality is the isomorphism of Lemma 3.4.\nSince f|\u03c6 only has a pole at \u221e, of order at most p\u03bc n+qm, it also has at most this\nmany zeros, counted with multiplicity. If therefore f|\u2206 = 0 and f|\u03c6 6= 0, then we\nhave a function f|\u03c6 on C, obtained by restricting a function on C \u00d7 C that vanishes\non the diagonal, except at (\u221e, \u221e). Apart from (\u221e, \u221e), the diagonal intersects the\ngraph of Frobenius at NC (1) \u2212 1 points. Since f|\u03c6 is a p\u03bc -th power, this function\nhas at least p\u03bc (NC (1) \u2212 1) zeros, counted with multiplicity. Comparing with the\npole of f|\u03c6 , we find the inequality NC (1) \u2264 1 + n + pq\u03bc m. By (3.6), 1 + n \u2264 qp\u2212\u03bc ,\nhence we obtain\nq\n(3.7)\nNC (1) \u2264 \u03bc (m + 1).\np\n\n\f22\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nIn particular, for given \u03bc, the best bound for NC (1) is obtained when m is as small\nas possible.\nExample 3.5. For genus zero, we take\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nf (X, Y ) = X p \u2212 Y p .\n\nThen f|\u03c6 (X) = X p \u2212 X qp and f|\u2206 (X) = 0. The function f|\u03c6 has a pole at infinity\nof order qp\u03bc , and at least p\u03bc (NC (1) \u2212 1) zeros, counted with multiplicity. Hence the\nnumber of points on the projective line over Fq satisfies NP1 (1) \u2264 q + 1. In fact,\nequality holds.\nFor higher genus, we will not explicitly construct a function f such that f|\u2206 = 0\nand f|\u03c6 6= 0, but we prove that such a function exists. The space of functions f (X, Y )\nthat we have constructed has dimension ln lm . Assume that\nn, m \u2265 g.\n\nThen ln lm \u2265 (n + 1 \u2212 g)(m + 1 \u2212 g) by (3.4). The functions f|\u2206 lie in Lp\u03bc n+m . To\nassure the existence of a nontrivial function such that f|\u2206 = 0, we choose n and m\nso that (n + 1 \u2212 g)(m + 1 \u2212 g) > lp\u03bc n+m , since then the kernel of the map f 7\u2192 f|\u2206\nis nontrivial. Since p\u03bc n + m > 2g \u2212 2 and by (3.5), this means that we want\nor equivalently,\n(3.8)\n\n(n + 1 \u2212 g)(m + 1 \u2212 g) > p\u03bc n + m + 1 \u2212 g,\n(m + 1 \u2212 g \u2212 p\u03bc )(n \u2212 g) > p\u03bc g.\n\nSince we want to choose m as small as possible, we choose n as large as possible.\nThe largest value for n so that (3.6) is satisfied is\nn = qp\u2212\u03bc \u2212 1.\n\nWe thus obtain from (3.8) a lower bound for m, which we can write as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\np\u03bc\nq\nq\n\u03bc\n>\nq\n+\ng\n.\n(m\n+\n1)\n>\nq\n+\ng\n+\n+\np\np\u03bc\np\u03bc\n1 \u2212 (g + 1)p\u03bc /q\np\u03bc\n\nThus the upper bound for NC (1) that we can derive from (3.7) is best possible\nif q/p\u03bc = p\u03bc . Therefore, we assume that q is an even power of p, as we may by\n\u221a\nLemma 3.1, and we choose \u03bc such that p\u03bc = q. Then (3.8) is equivalent to\nm+1>\n\n\u221a\ng(g + 1)\nq + 2g + \u221a\n.\nq \u2212 (g + 1)\n\nFor q > (g + 1)4 , this inequality is satisfied for\n\u221a\nm + 1 = q + 2g + 1.\n\nWith these choices, there exists a nontrivial function f on C\u00d7C such that f|\u2206 = 0.\nBy Lemma 3.4, also f|\u03c6 is nontrivial, hence we obtain the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.6.

Let X and Y denote the 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' coordinates on C \u2032 \u00d7 C \u2032 ;\nsee Figure 3.2.

That is, if \u03b6C (s) = 0\nthen Re s = 1/2.\nProof. As in (3.10), let C \u2032 be the Galois closure of the cover C \u2192 P1 , with Galois\ngroup G. Consider the sum\nX\nNC \u2032 (1, \u03c3).\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\nAbove every point t of P1 (Fq ), we have |G|/e points of C \u2032 (F\u0304p ), where e is the\nramification index of any of the associated valuations in C \u2032 . Further, for a point t\u2032\nof C \u2032 above t, we have e different automorphisms in G that induce Frobenius on\nthe residue class field. Hence in the sum, each point of P1 (Fq ) is counted |G| times.\nSince P1 (Fq ) has q + 1 points, we obtain\nX\nNC \u2032 (1, \u03c3) = |G|(q + 1).\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\nBy Theorem 3.7, applied to each summand NC \u2032 (1, \u03c3) for \u03c3 6= \u03c4 , we obtain for each\n\u03c4 \u2208 G,\nX\n\u221a\nNC \u2032 (1, \u03c4 ) = |G|(q + 1) \u2212\nNC \u2032 (1, \u03c3) \u2265 q \u2212 (|G| \u2212 1)(2g \u2032 + 1) q + |G|.\n\u03c36=\u03c4\n\nLet H be the subgroup of G of covering transformations that act trivially on C.

Comparison with the Riemann Hypothesis\nThe field of functions on a curve is analogous to the field Q of rational numbers.\nHowever, since Q has no field of constants, there is no analogue of the points\non C. Therefore there is no Frobenius flow as in Section 3.2 on spec Z, even though\nin every Galois extension of Q there are local Frobenius automorphisms associated\nwith every prime number, as in Section 3.4. Moreover, since the numbers log |x|, for\nx \u2208 Q, are dense on the real line, we cannot separate the \"point counting\nfunction\"\nP\nin the different degrees.

Table 4.1 compares the\nRiemann zeta function with the zeta function of C.\n\nRemark 4.1. As is pointed out in [6, Remark c, p. 72], even though the Frobenius\nflow for the rational numbers is not known, the dual algebraic picture obtained\nfrom class field theory is complete. Thus the Frobenius flow on C corresponds to\nthe action of q in the idele class group A\u2217 /K \u2217 on the space of adele classes A/K \u2217 ,\nand the Frobenius flow on spec Z corresponds to the action of R>0 \u2282 A\u2217 /Q\u2217 on the\nspace A/Q\u2217 . In additive language, according to Deninger [8,9], the analogue of the\nFrobenius flow of the first step may be provided by the shift on the real line.\n\n\f26\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nTable 4.1.

To translate the argument of Section 3.2, we could try to construct\na polynomial that vanishes at all prime numbers up to a certain bound. The\ninfinitesimal generator of the shift on the real line, which is the counterpart of\nthe Frobenius flow by Remark 4.1, is the derivative operator. So we may try to\nconstruct such a function that vanishes at the prime numbers to a high order. Then\nwe want to bound the degree of this polynomial.\nThe \"degree\" of a rational prime number is log p, so a prime number should\ncorrespond to log p points on some curve. In Nevanlinna Theory (see, for example,\n11This is a consequence of the density of log |x|, x \u2208 Q, in the real line.\n\n\fTHE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS FOR FUNCTION FIELDS OVER A FINITE FIELD\n\n27\n\n[17, 21]), the counting function of zeros of a meromorphic function f in the disc of\nradius r is\nX\nr\nordx (f ) log\n,\nNf (0, r) =\n|x|\n|x|<r : f (x)=0\n\nso one could consider a function such as\nY\nf (z) =\n(1 \u2212 pz)[logp x]\np\u2264x\n\non the unit disc. For this function\nNf (0, 1) = \u03c8(x).\nTrying to copy Bombieri's proof, we could take si = z 1\u2212i for i \u2265 1 as the basis\nof functions that have only a pole at 'infinity', and the coefficients are functions\non spec Z with a pole at v\u221e alone, that is, the coefficients are integers bi . Thus12\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbi z 1\u2212i .\n\ni=1\n\nNote that the coefficients are determined by f , that is, the analogue of Lemma 3.4\n\u03bc\nis automatically satisfied. We do not know what the analogue of the choice bi = api\ncould be.\nThe main problem is that the arithmetic coordinate cannot be compared with\nthe geometric coordinate: z \u2208 C is the geometric coordinate and the coefficients\nof f are integers, i.e., functions on the arithmetic coordinate spec Z. Hence there\nis no diagonal and we have to force the vanishing of f at the primes in an artificial\nmanner. As a consequence, we do not know how to bound the Nevanlinna height\n(i.e., the degree) of this function.\nIt is interesting to pursue this idea a little further. For r > 0, let \u2206r be the disc\nof radius r with boundary \u0393r , positively oriented. Let\nf (z) = cz ord(f,0) + . . .\n\n(4.1)\n\nbe a meromorphic function with leading coefficient c in its Laurent series at 0.\nNevanlinna theory starts with the Poisson\u2013Jensen formula, which we interpret as a\nsum over all valuations of the field of meromorphic functions on \u2206r ,\nZ\nX\ndz\nr\nvz (f )\nvx (f ) log\n(4.2)\n+\n= \u2212 log |c|,\nv0 (f ) log r +\n|x|\n2\u03c0iz\n\u0393r\n0<|x|<r\n\nwhere the valuations are vz (f ) = \u2212 log |f (z)| for each z on the boundary of the disc\nof radius r, and vx (f ) = ord(f, x) for each x inside the disc.13\nNote that the sum (4.2) of the valuations is constant,P\ndepending on the function\nbut not on r. This should be compared to the fact that v v(\u03b1) deg v = 0 for every\nnonzero function in the function field of C. It is a mystery why in Nevanlinna theory,\nthe sum over all valuations does not necessarily vanish. However, if we consider the\n12If this series is infinite, it does not converge for |z| \u2264 1, so we may have to require that it\nhas an analytic continuation.\n13Note that v log r is only a valuation for r \u2265 1 and that it is the trivial valuation for r = 1.\n0\n\n\f28\n\nMACHIEL VAN FRANKENHUIJSEN\n\nsubfield of functions for which the Laurent series has rational coefficients, then we\ncan write the Poisson\u2013Jensen formula as, with c \u2208 Q as in (4.1),\nZ\nX\nX\nr\ndz\nvx (f ) log\nvp (c) log p + v0 (f ) log r +\nvz (f )\n+\n= 0,\n|x|\n2\u03c0iz\n\u0393r\np6=\u221e\n\n0<|x|<r\n\nwhere the first sum is over all p-adic valuations of Q. It is still puzzling why\nthe archimedean valuation v\u221e (c) = \u2212 log |c| should be excluded from this sum.\nWe interpret this as meaning that the arithmetic and geometric coordinates (in the\nsense of Remark 3.3) meet at v0 (geometrically) and v\u221e (arithmetically). Since this\nis not a double point, we only see v0 . Note that the archimedean valuations have\nall been pushed to the boundary of the disc, and that they are the only nondiscrete\nvaluations.\nRemark 4.2. For large r, the archimedean valuations are essentially nonarchimedean, since for two meromorphic functions f and g that are not a constant multiple\nof each other, |f (z) + g(z)| will be close to max{|f (z)|, |g(z)|} on most of the circle \u0393r , and only on small portions of \u0393r will f (z) and g(z) be comparable in size.\nMore specifically, if the only defects (in the sense of Nevanlinna theory) of f /g are\namong \u221e, 0, \u22121, e2\u03c0i/3 and e4\u03c0i/3 , then the archimedean valuations behave like\nnonarchimedean valuations for large r.\nIt seems that by Nevanlinna theory we obtain a connection, albeit a rather loose\none, between the geometric valuations vz and vx , and the arithmetic valuations vp ,\nand seemingly, the geometric and arithmetic coordinates intersect at v0 . We consider this the point 'at infinity', as in the exposition of Bombieri's proof of the\nRiemann hypothesis for a curve C. We invite the reader to continue this line of\nreasoning.\nAcknowledgements.
