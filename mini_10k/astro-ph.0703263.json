Our goal is to probe the populations of obscured and unobscured AGN investigating their optical-IR and Xray properties as a function of X-ray flux, luminosity and redshift within a hard X-ray selected sample with wide\nmultiwavelength coverage.\nMethods. We selected a sample of 136 X-ray sources detected at a significance of \u2265 3\u03c3 in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band\n\u221214\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) in a \u223c 1 deg2 area in the XMM Medium Deep Survey (XMDS). The XMDS area is\n(F2\u221210 >\n\u223c 10\ncovered with optical photometry from the VVDS and CFHTLS surveys and infrared Spitzer data from the SWIRE\nsurvey. Based on the X-ray luminosity and X-ray to optical ratio, 132 sources are likely AGN, of which 122 have\nunambiguous optical - IR identification. The observed optical and IR spectral energy distributions of all identified\nsources are fitted with AGN/galaxy templates in order to classify them and compute photometric redshifts. X-ray\nspectral analysis is performed individually for sources with a sufficient number of counts and using a stacking technique\nfor subsamples of sources at different flux levels. Hardness ratios are used to estimate X-ray absorption in individual\nweak sources.\nResults. 70% of the AGN are fitted by a type 2 AGN or a star forming galaxy template. We group them together in a\nsingle class of \"optically obscured\" AGN. These have \"red\" optical colors and in about 60% of cases show significant\nX-ray absorption (NH > 1022 cm\u22122 ). Sources with SEDs typical of type 1 AGN have \"blue\" optical colors and exhibit\nX-ray absorption in about 30% of cases. The stacked X-ray spectrum of obscured AGN is flatter than that of type 1\nAGN and has an average spectral slope of \u0393 = 1.6. The subsample of objects fitted by a star forming galaxy template\nhas an even harder stacked spectrum, with \u0393 \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.3. The obscured fraction is larger at lower fluxes, lower redshifts\nand lower luminosities. X-ray absorption is less common than \"optical\" obscuration and its incidence is nearly constant\nwith redshift and luminosity. This implies that at high luminosities X-ray absorption is not necessarily related to optical\nobscuration. The estimated surface densities of obscured, unobscured AGN and type 2 QSOs are respectively 138, 59\nand 35 deg\u22122 at F > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nKey words. X-ray \u2013 AGN \u2013 X-ray surveys\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the goals of deep X-ray surveys is to probe the origin\nof the X-ray background (XRB) to the faintest flux levels;\nthey have resolved into discrete sources more than 90% of\nthe XRB in the 0.5 \u2212 2 keV band and up to 80 - 90% in the\n2 \u2212 10 keV band (Giacconi et al., 2002; Alexander et al.,\n2003; Moretti et al., 2003; De Luca & Molendi, 2004). The\nresolved fraction of the XRB drops however to \u223c 60% above\nSend offprint requests to: M. Tajer\nCorrespondence to: marzia.tajer@brera.inaf.it\n\n\u223c 6 keV and \u223c 50% above \u223c 8 keV (Worsley et al., 2005).\nMost of the sources detected in deep, pencil-beam X-ray\nsurveys are characterized by poor counting statistics, preventing a detailed analysis of X-ray spectral properties, and\noptical counterparts are often too faint for spectroscopic\nfollow-up. Medium deep surveys, covering larger areas, are\nuseful to bridge the gap between known X-ray source populations at low redshifts and those required to model the\nbackground and to collect a large number of sources for\nwhich X-ray and optical spectral analysis are feasible (e.g.\nPiconcelli et al., 2003; Georgakakis et al., 2006). They are\n\n\f2\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nalso more effective than deep surveys to find rare objects,\nsuch as type 2 QSOs (Fiore et al., 2003).\nThe XMM Medium Deep Survey (XMDS, see\nChiappetti et al., 2005, hereafter Paper I) consists of 19\nX-ray pointings, of nominal exposure of 20 ksec, covering a contiguous area of about 2.6 deg2 . It also lies\nat the heart of the larger, shallower XMM Large Scale\nStructure (LSS) Survey (Pierre et al., 2004; Pacaud et al.,\n2006), which will cover \u223c 10 deg2 and is principally devoted to clusters study (Pierre et al., 2006). Several surveys\nat different wavelengths are associated to the XMDS: the\nVIRMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS, Le F\u00e8vre et al., 2004)\nand the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey\n(CFHTLS)1 in the optical, the UKIRT Infrared Deep\nSky Survey (UKIDSS, Dye et al., 2006; Lawrence et al.,\n2006) in the near-IR and the Spitzer Wide-Area InfraRed\nExtragalactic Legacy Survey (SWIRE, Lonsdale et al.,\n2003)2 in the mid-IR. Radio observations performed at\nVLA at 1.4 GHz (Bondi et al., 2003) and at 325 and 74\nMHz (Cohen et al., 2003) also cover the XMDS area.\nIn Paper I the catalogue of XMDS sources detected\n(S/N \u2265 4\u03c3) in at least one of five energy bands 0.3 \u2212 0.5,\n0.5 \u2212 2, 2 \u2212 4.5, 4.5 \u2212 10 and 2 \u2212 10 keV within the VVDS\nfield (area \u223c 1 deg2 ) was presented together with tentative\noptical identifications. The logN-logS distributions were derived for X-ray sources in the full XMDS area separately in\nthe two bands 0.5 \u2212 2 and 2 \u2212 10 keV. Gandhi et al. (2006)\ncomputed the logN-logS in the same energy bands for Xray sources in the whole XMM - LSS area, finding results\nin agreement with those of Paper I.\nHere we consider a sample of X-ray sources selected in\nthe \"hard\", 2 \u2212 10 keV, band, in order to investigate the\npopulations of obscured and unobscured AGN and discuss\ntheir multiwavelength properties in a way unbiased by the\nintensity of the sources in soft X-rays. In order to take\nadvantage of the best multifrequency coverage available,\nwe consider sources in the VVDS area. Using the Spitzer\ndata we construct the mid-IR/optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources to estimate redshifts and classify AGN into different categories according\nto the best fitting template. We use the term \"optically\nunobscured\" AGN for objects fitted by a type 1 AGN template, and \"optically obscured\" AGN for objects fitted by\ntype 2 AGN or a star forming galaxy template, indicating\nthat the optical-UV emission from the AGN is at least partially hidden. In a companion paper (Polletta et al., 2007)\nthe templates used and the observed SEDs are presented\nin detail and their dependence on luminosity and absorption is discussed. A comparison between X-ray and optical\nproperties of AGN with optical spectroscopy in the whole\nXMM-LSS is in progress (Garcet et al., in prep.).\nIndependently of the SED classification, the X-ray spectra and/or hardness ratios allow us to estimate absorption\nin the X-ray band, associated to intervening gas. In unified models for AGN (e.g. Antonucci, 1993), obscuration by\ndust and absorption by gas are thought to occur in a dusty\ntorus surrounding the AGN. The increasing complexity of\nproperties shown by individual AGN has lead to a revision\nof this simple scheme proposing different regions around\nthe AGN as sites of absorption at different wavelengths\n(e.g. Elvis, 2000; Krongold et al., 2007; Elitzur, 2006).

Optical and IR identifications are discussed in Section 3 while the X-ray, optical\nand IR properties of the sample are derived in Section 4.\nThe template SEDs and fitting process leading to the estimate of photometric redshifts and to the AGN classification\nare described in Section 5. The X-ray spectral analysis is\npresented in Section 6: X-ray spectra are analyzed individually for sufficiently bright sources, while for faint sources\nabsorption is estimated from hardness ratios. A stacking\ntechnique is used to derive average X-ray spectra of subsamples of AGN with different SED classification. The surface density of optically obscured and unobscured AGN and\nof type 2 QSOs is derived in Section 7. Section 8 is devoted\nto the comparison of the fractions of optically obscured or\nX-ray absorbed AGN as a function of redshift, X-ray flux\nand luminosity. Finally, in Section 9 the results are summarized.\nThroughout the paper H0 = 70 Km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b =\n0.7 and \u03a9M = 0.3 are assumed.\n\n2. The multiwavelength data set\nThe layout of the XMDS observations is shown in Fig. 1;\nsuperposed are the areas covered by the various associated\nsurveys at other wavelengths, VVDS and CFHTLS in the\noptical, UKIDSS in the near-infrared and SWIRE in the\nmid-infrared. Shallower XMM - Newton pointings in the\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 2. 2 - 10 keV flux distribution for the 136 X-ray sources\nin the 3 \u03c3 hard sample.\ncontext of the XMM - LSS lie all around the XMDS area\n(see Pierre et al., in prep.)\n2.1. X-ray data\nThe sample includes 136 X-ray sources detected at \u2265 3\u03c3 in\nthe 2 \u2212 10 keV band (the 3 \u03c3 hard sample hereafter), which\nfall within the sky area covered by the VVDS photometric\nsurvey (\u223c 1 deg2 , solid rectangle in Fig. 1). This area benefits from the richest multiwavelength coverage as evident\nfrom Fig. 1.\nThe sources were extracted from the XMDS catalog described in Paper I, to which we refer also for details on\nthe XMM - Newton observations and data reduction. For\nall the sources count rates and fluxes were obtained independently in 5 energy bands: 0.3 \u2212 0.5, 0.5 \u2212 2, 2 \u2212 4.5,\n4.5 \u2212 10 and 2 \u2212 10 keV. Fluxes were computed for a simple power law spectrum with spectral index \u0393 = 1.7 and\nthe average galactic column density in the XMDS region\n(NH = 2.61 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , Dickey & Lockman, 1990) separately in each energy band. Fig. 2 shows the 2 \u2212 10 keV flux\ndistribution; the lowest flux that we sample is \u223c 10\u221214 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nHardness ratios were computed for all sources (see subsection 6.2). For 55 sources we detect a sufficient number of\nnet counts (> 50 in the 2\u221210 keV band) to attempt a spectral analysis for each source (see details in subsection 6.1).\n2.2. Optical and near-infrared data\nBroad band BVRI photometric observations from the\nVVDS (McCracken et al., 2003) are available for XMDS\nsources over an area of about 1 deg2 . This photometry was\nobtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)\nwith the CFH12K camera at limiting magnitudes of BAB \u223c\n26.5, VAB \u223c 26.2, RAB \u223c 25.9 and IAB \u223c 25.0 (50% completeness for point sources).\n\n3\n\nThe U band imaging was performed over an effective\narea of \u223c 0.71 deg2 with the Wide Field Imaging (WFI)\nmosaic camera on the ESO MPI 2.2 m telescope at La Silla,\nChile. Two different U filters were used, the ESO U /360\nfilter and the Loiano Observatory U filter. The limiting\nmagnitude is UAB \u223c 25.4 (see Radovich et al., 2004).\nA small area (\u223c 165 arcmin2 ) within the VVDS was also\nobserved in the J and K bands down to a limiting magnitude of JAB \u223c 24.2 and KAB \u223c 23.9 (50% completeness for\npoint sources) with the SOFI instrument mounted on the\nESO NTT telescope. A detailed description of the K band\nimaging survey is reported in Iovino et al. (2005).\nOptical spectroscopy with the VIsible Multi Object\nSpectrograph (VIMOS) on the ESO \u2013 VLT UT3 in the\nVVDS area is still in progress; the project aims at observing a representative large subsample of objects down to a\nlimiting mag of IAB \u2264 24 (Le F\u00e8vre et al., 2005). 9 sources\nin the present sample have been observed and for 8 of them\na redshift has been derived. Additional spectroscopic redshifts for 22 sources have recently been obtained from 2dF\nand VLT FORS2 observations performed in the context of\nXMM-LSS follow up campaigns (see Garcet et al., in prep.).\nThree other redshifts are from the literature.\nThe XMDS area lies within the sky region covered by\nthe CFHTLS, a large collaborative project between the\nCanadian and French communities. Observations use the\nwide field imager MegaPrime equipped with MegaCam, in\nthe u\u2217 g \u2032 r\u2032 i\u2032 z \u2032 filters. Both the \"Wide\" survey field W1 (8\ndeg \u00d7 9 deg) and the \"Deep\" survey field D1 (1 deg \u00d7\n1 deg) cover the XMDS region at a depth of i\u2032 = 24.5\n(Hoekstra et al., 2006) and i\u2032 = 26.1 (50% completeness\nlimit, Semboloni et al., 2006), respectively. In the following\nwe will use the D1 notation for data from the CFHTLS\nDeep and the W1 notation for data from the CFHTLS\nWide. W1 observations have been recently completed; the\ncoverage shown in Fig 1 is deduced from data available to\nus at the time of analysis.\nNear-infrared observations of the XMDS area are also\nin progress in the context of the UKIDSS (Dye et al., 2006;\nLawrence et al., 2006). The survey uses the Wide Field\nCamera (WFCAM) of the 3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared\nTelescope (UKIRT). The XMM-LSS region is one of the\nfour target fields of the Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS).\nObservations in the J and K filters down to J = 22.3 and\nK = 20.8 (Vega system) are in progress. About 0.8 deg2 of\nsky have been observed up to now and part of the data are\navailable in the UKIDSS Early Data Release (Dye et al.,\n2006). The photometric system used in the UKIDSS is described in Hewett et al. (2006).\n2.3. Mid-infrared data\nThe XMDS and XMM-LSS fields are covered by the\nSWIRE survey (Lonsdale et al., 2003). Observations were\nperformed with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at\n3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm and with the Multiband Imaging\nPhotometer (MIPS) at 24, 70 and 160 \u03bcm to a 5\u03c3 depth of\n4.3, 8.3, 58.5, 65.7 \u03bcJy and 0.24, 15, and 90 mJy, respectively. The area covered in the XMDS region is about 2.5\ndeg2 , corresponding to about 95% of the field. 12 sources\nin our selected sample are outside the region covered by\nSWIRE. Details on the SWIRE data and source catalogs\nare given in Surace et al. (2005).\n\n\f4\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n2.4. Radio data\nThere are also radio observations associated with the\nXMDS: the VLA VIRMOS Survey, which covers the VVDS\narea at a depth of 80 \u03bcJy (5\u03c3 limit) and a resolution of 6\u2032\u2032\nat 1.4 GHz (Bondi et al., 2003; Ciliegi et al., 2005) and a\nlow frequency radio survey performed for the XMM-LSS\nalso at VLA, which covers 5.6 deg2 at a depth of 4 mJy at\n74 MHz and 110 deg2 at a depth of 275 mJy at 325 MHz\n(Cohen et al., 2003).\n\n3. Optical and Infrared identifications\nMost (80%) of the 136 X-ray sources in the present sample were already included in the 4\u03c3 catalogue presented in\nPaper I since they are also detected at \u2265 4\u03c3 in the softer\nbands. 24 X-ray sources are considered here for the first\ntime. Although most sources had already been assigned optical counterparts, we have repeated the identification procedure on the whole sample in a semi automatic way, that\ntakes into account the experience accumulated in Paper I\nand the CFHTLS and SWIRE data now available.\nAccess to the whole VVDS and CFHTLS catalogues\nand images is restricted: photometric data and positions are\nprovided only for optical sources within a fixed radius from\nthe X-ray positions. The same is true for the SWIRE data.\nWe then associated to each X-ray source all combinations of\noptical and IR objects in the considered catalogues within\na search radius of 6\u2032\u2032 . Objects in the VVDS, CFHTLS and\nSWIRE catalogues were matched only a posteriori.\nWe computed the probability of chance coincidence\nbetween an X-ray source and all optical VVDS, optical\nCFHTLS and infrared SWIRE candidates within the search\nradius using the following equation (Downes et al., 1986,\nsee also Paper I)\np = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c0 n(< m) r2 )\nwhere r is the distance between the X-ray source and the\nproposed counterpart (with a lower value fixed at 2\u2032\u2032 , which\nroughly corresponds to the XMM - Newton astrometric uncertainty), and n(< m) is the density of objects brighter\nthan the magnitude m of the candidate counterpart. We\nused I magnitudes for VVDS sources and i\u2032 magnitudes\nfor CFHTLS objects (D1 data where available). We used\nthe density n(> F3.6 ) for infrared candidate counterparts.\nFor each candidate counterpart there are therefore from 1\nto 3 values of p, depending if the object is detected in the\nVVDS, CFHTLS and SWIRE. We classified the probabilities as \"good\" (p < 0.01), \"fair\" (0.01 < p < 0.03) or otherwise \"bad\" and took as identification the object with the\nbest probability combination. All tentative identifications\nwere then checked by visual inspection using the VVDS\nfinding charts. As reported in Paper I, astrometrical corrections were already applied to the X-ray fields, so we find\nagain that 98% of the counterparts are within 4\u2032\u2032 from the\nX-ray corrected position, justifying our conservative choice\nof 6\u2032\u2032 radius.\nThe probability criterion allows us to prefer one candidate counterpart in the majority of cases, giving us 126\nsecure identifications (out of 136 sources). Of these, 3 have\nonly IR counterparts (i.e. no optical counterparts are detected down to RAB = 25.3) and will be referred to as\noptically blank fields. We notice that all sources covered by\nSWIRE (i.e. all but 12) are also detected in the IR.\n\nFor the remaining 10 sources, the identification process\nis ambiguous leaving two or more possible counterparts,\nwith similar probabilities. However, in 6 cases, the counterparts have similar magnitudes and colors allowing us to\ninclude these sources in parts of the discussion not involving the redshift determination or SED classification. In the\nother 4 cases, the sources are completely dismissed.\nThe X-ray, optical and infrared properties of sources of\nthe 3 \u03c3 hard sample are reported in Table A.1. For brevity,\nnot all data used in this work are reported in the Table.\nThe SWIRE catalogue is available through IRSA/Gator\n(http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator).\nWe plan to publish the Catalogue of all XMDS X-ray\nsources with optical and IR identifications in a future\npaper.\nWe also searched for UKIDSS counterparts of X-ray\nsources using a radius of 4\u2032\u2032 , finding a near infrared counterpart for 72 X-ray sources. Generally UKIDSS sources\nare coincident with optical counterparts. There are however\ntwo exceptions: source XMDS 4493 for which the UKIDSS\nsource lies between the two possible counterparts, at a distance of about 3\u2032\u2032 from both, and XMDS 760, for which\nthere are two possible UKIDSS counterparts, both within\n\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 from the optical counterpart. The first case is one\nof the 4 X-ray sources that we could not identify, and the\nUKIDSS detection did not allow us to resolve the ambiguity. In the second case we associated to the optical counterpart the brightest UKIDSS source.\n33 X-ray sources in the 3\u03c3 hard sample (24%) have a\nradio counterpart at 1.4 GHz, one of them is also detected\nat 325 MHz. One is however associated with the spectroscopically confirmed cluster XLSSC 025. We will not use\nthe radio information in this work, but we checked the consistency of the radio fluxes with the templates used to fit\nthe optical and infrared spectral energy distributions of our\nobjects (see Section 5). The correlation between the X-ray\nand radio luminosities is explored in Polletta et al. (2007).\n\n4. The AGN sample\nIgnoring two sources corresponding to spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxy clusters (XLSSC 025 and 041, see\nPierre et al., 2006), we computed the X-ray to optical ratio for 124 sources with secure identifications, using the\nequation given in section 6.2 of Paper I. For about 20 objects for which VVDS magnitudes were unreliable because\nof saturation or unfavorable position in the field of view, the\nCFHTLS r\u2032 band magnitudes were used, with the appropriate conversion factor taken from Silverman et al. (2005).\nThe X-ray to optical ratio is shown as a function of X-ray\nflux in Fig. 3.\nAbout 80% of the sources fall in the typical range\nof X-ray to optical ratio corresponding to the locus of\nAGN (0.1 < FX /FR < 10, see e.g. Akiyama et al., 2000;\nHornschemeier et al., 2001), while about 20% of the sources\nhave FX /FR > 10, which corresponds to heavy absorption\nin the optical and/or high redshift (Hornschemeier et al.,\n2001). This issue will be further developed in subsection 7.1.\n3\nFor brevity, in the text we label single sources with their\nXMDS identification number. The names of the sources, complying the IAU standard, along with the associated identifiers,\nare reported in Table A.1.\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n5\n\nR = 25\nR = 22\n\nR = 19\n\nR = 17\n\nFig. 3. X-ray to optical ratio (2\u221210 keV band vs R band) as\na function of X-ray flux for sources in the 3 \u03c3 hard sample.\nDiagonal dotted lines indicate loci of constant R magnitude\nwhile horizontal solid lines mark the region of canonical\nAGN (0.1 < FX /FR < 10). Lower limits mark the optically\nblank fields, whose R magnitude was fixed to 25.3 (see Fig.\n13 in McCracken et al., 2003).\n\nOnly two sources fall significantly below the AGN borderline (XMDS 1248 and 842): both appear extended in the\noptical as well as in the infrared images. The first (XMDS\n1248) has a low hardness ratio, consistent with no intrinsic\nabsorption in the X-ray spectrum, while the second (XMDS\n842) has a higher hardness ratio, possibly indicating X-ray\nabsorption (NH \u223c 1022 cm\u22122 ). Using photometric redshifts\n(see Section 5), we obtained X-ray luminosities of \u223c 1041\nerg s\u22121 for both of them, even after correcting for absorption (see Table A.1). We classify both provisionally as normal galaxies, though we can not exclude the presence of\na low luminosity AGN or even a Compton thick AGN in\nXMDS 842 (see e.g. FSC 1021+4724 in Alexander et al.,\n2005). Another source in the sample has L0.5\u221210 < 1042\nerg s\u22121 , XMDS 178, however its X-ray to optical ratio of\n0.27 is in the typical AGN range. On the basis of the X-ray\nto optical ratio, we retain this source in the AGN class. In\nPolletta et al. (2007) slightly different criteria are adopted\nfor these borderline objects.\nTo summarize, on the basis of the X-ray to optical flux\nratios 122 X-ray sources with unambiguous identification\ncan be classified as AGN and 2 as normal galaxies. In the\nfollowing subsections we will discuss the optical and IR\nproperties of this sample.\n4.1. Optical magnitude and colors\nThe B \u2212 I color and the RAB magnitude distributions for\nthe identified sources are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively.\nThe B \u2212 I color distribution shows a high peak at\nB \u2212 I \u2264 1.0, and a tail extending up to B \u2212 I \u223c 4. Based\n\nFig. 4. B \u2212 I distribution for optical counterparts of X-ray\nsources in the 3 \u03c3 hard sample. The dotted line marks the\ndivision between the adopted definition of \"blue\" and \"red\"\nobjects (see text).\n\nFig. 5. R magnitude distribution for the 3 \u03c3 hard sample. Solid histogram: total sample; dotted histogram: blue\nsources (see text); dashed histogram: red sources (see text).\non the observed color distribution we adopt a somewhat\narbitrary threshold of B \u2212 I = 1.0 to divide the sample\ninto two roughly equal size samples of \"blue\" objects, with\nB \u2212 I < 1.0 (43% of all sources), and \"red\" objects, with\nB \u2212 I > 1.0 (57%). As will be shown later, this criterion,\nalthough crude, proved to be a good one for a rough separation between type 1 (i.e. broad line) AGN and type 2\n(narrow line) or star forming galaxy-like AGN based on\nobserved quantities alone, and is substantially confirmed\n\n\f6\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 6. B \u2212 I color vs I magnitude for sources in the 3 \u03c3\nhard sample. Empty circles are blue objects, filled circles\nare red objects. Overimposed to points are the evolutionary\ntracks for an Sc galaxy (solid line), a type 1 QSO (dotted\nline), a type 2 AGN (short-dashed line) and a type 2 AGN\nplus a starburst component (long-dashed line). The B band\nabsolute magnitudes assumed are \u221215.7 for the Sc galaxy\ntemplate, \u221222.3 for the QSO1, \u221216.9 for the type 2 AGN\nand \u221223.9 for the type AGN plus starburst.\n\nby the more detailed (but model-dependent) classification\nbased on the spectral energy distributions.\nThe magnitude distributions of these two broad classes\nare plotted separately in Fig. 5: on average, blue sources\n(B \u2212 I \u2264 1.0) are brighter, with a peak at R \u223c 20 and 90%\nof objects at R < 22, while red sources (B \u2212 I > 1.0) have\na broader distribution, extending from R \u223c 18 to R \u223c 26.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the B \u2212 I color as a function of\nthe I magnitude for our sources, along with the evolutionary tracks for various templates: a late spiral galaxy\n(Sc, solid line), a type 1 QSO (dotted line), a type 2 AGN\n(short-dashed line) and a type 2 AGN plus a starburst\ncomponent (long-dashed line; see below and Polletta et al.,\n2007). The effects of absorption due to the Intergalactic\nMedium (IGM) have been taken into account at high redshift (z \u2265 2.5) as prescribed in Madau (1995). Blue sources\nare near the QSO1 track, while red objects are generally\nconsistent with star forming galaxies and AGN2 tracks.\nHowever for magnitudes fainter than IAB = 23 the different track cross, and type 1 AGN, type 2 AGN and star\nforming galaxies have similar colors.\n4.2. X-ray to infrared ratios\nIn Fig. 7 we plot the ratios of X-ray to infrared fluxes at\n3.6\u03bcm (left panel) and 24\u03bcm respectively (right panel) as a\nfunction of the X-ray flux. Sources are all clustered in the\nsame region with no clear separation between blue and red\nsources.\n\nFig. 8. IRAC color - color plot for sources in the 3 \u03c3 hard\nsample. Empty circles are blue sources, filled circles are\nred sources, crosses are the optically blank fields or sources\nwith undefined color classification. Left pointing arrows are\nsources undetected in the 5.8 \u03bcm band, down pointing arrows are sources undetected in the 8.0 \u03bcm band. 5 \u03c3 upper\nlimits are used. The dashed lines mark the region expected\nfor AGN according to Lacy et al. (2004)\n\nTwo typical loci of local sources are shown in the right\npanel of Fig. 7: the area at \u22120.8 < log(FX /FIR ) < 0 is\nthe region occupied by hard X-ray selected AGN (from\nPiccinotti et al., 1982) with IR emission and z < 0.12; the\narea close to log(FX /FIR ) = \u22123 is the region occupied by\nlocal starburst galaxies from Ranalli et al. (2003), adapted\nfrom Alonso-Herrero et al. (2004). No objects with X-ray to\ninfrared ratios typical of local starburst galaxies are found\nin our sample. 80% of the objects have X-ray/infrared ratios \u22121 < log(FX /\u03bd3.6 S3.6 ) < 0 (i.e. within a factor of 10),\nand 98% of them have \u22121.2 < log(FX /\u03bd3.6 S3.6 ) < 0.6 (i.e.\na factor of \u223c 70). The most discrepant object is one of the\ntwo normal galaxies with low X-ray to optical ratio (see\nabove). The X-ray to optical ratios for the same sources\nranges from \u223c 0.1 to \u223c 60 (i.e. a factor of 600 excluding\nlower limits, see Fig. 3). This implies that the IR flux is a\nbetter diagnostics of the X-ray flux compared to the optical, a behaviour likely due to the smaller extinction in the\nIR and to the fact that nuclear light absorbed by dust is\nlikely re-radiated in the IR.\nThe observed range in the FX /\u03bd24 S24 plot is fully\nconsistent with other X-ray and 24 \u03bcm samples,\n(e.g. Alonso-Herrero et al., 2004; Franceschini et al., 2005;\nPolletta et al., 2006), but broader than that of local hard Xray selected AGN of Piccinotti et al. (1982). This broader\ndispersion is not surprising given the better sensitivity of Xray observations with respect to the Piccinotti et al. (1982)\ndata.\nA broad range in the X-ray to infrared ratio could\nbe caused by different amounts of absorption in different\nsources that depresses the observed X-ray flux, but not the\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n7\n\nFig. 7. X-ray to IR ratio as a function of X-ray flux for sources in the 3\u03c3 hard sample. Empty circles are blue sources,\nfilled circles are red sources, crosses are the optically blank fields or sources with undefined color classification (because\nB or I magnitudes are not available). In the left panel IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm flux is used, while in the right panel MIPS 24 \u03bcm\nis used. Lower limits are sources detected in one or more IRAC bands and undetected in the MIPS 24 \u03bcm band, where 5\n\u03c3 upper limit is used. The diagonally shaded area is the region occupied by hard X-ray selected AGN with IR emission\nand z < 0.12 from Piccinotti et al. (1982); the horizontally shaded area is the region occupied by local starburst galaxies\nfrom Ranalli et al. (2003).\ninfrared emission. Alternatively, it could be an intrinsic dispersion in the AGN SEDs that is not sampled properly in\nlocal objects. If this dispersion were due only to absorption in the X-rays, it would imply a broad range of column\ndensities, up to 1.5 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 , consistent with the distribution of measured column densities (see subsection 6.2).\nHowever, the similarity in the distribution of flux ratios of\nblue and red sources is not observed in the column density\ndistribution, the majority of blue sources being unabsorbed\nand the majority of red sources being absorbed. These arguments suggest that the variety of the intrinsic SED shapes\nthat characterize the AGN population is a more likely explanation and that such a variety is also observed for optically blue AGN. In fact a recent study of X-ray and 24\u03bcmselected AGN by Rigby et al. (2005) shows that there is\nno correlation between the ratio F (X)/\u03bd24 F (24\u03bcm) and the\namount of absorption in the X-rays, or their optical properties. Elvis et al. (1994) measure a dispersion of a factor of\n10 at 24\u03bcm for a large sample of optically-selected quasars\nafter normalizing their SEDs at 1 \u03bcm, consistent with the\nobserved dispersion in the X-ray/infrared flux ratios of our\nsample. An analysis of the SEDs of the AGN in the sample is presented in the next Section and in more detail in\nPolletta et al. (2007).\nIRAC infrared colors proved to be a useful diagnostics to\nidentify AGN among IR sources; in particular, Lacy et al.\n(2004) found that the 8.0/4.5 \u03bcm ratio vs the 5.8/3.6 \u03bcm\nratio plot is effective in isolating AGN in IR selected samples, which have red colors (i.e. high values of the ratios)\nin both axis. In Fig. 8 we reproduce the plot of Lacy et al.\n(2004) for sources in our sample, and we find that the vast\nmajority of them (both optically blue and red) lies in the\nregion expected for AGN. At the boundaries of the AGN region there could be contamination by low redshift galaxies\n(Lacy et al., 2004); in fact, all the objects near the borders\nof the AGN region in Fig. 8 have a red optical color. The\nAGN with the reddest IR colors are predominantly blue in\n\nthe optical, while optically red AGN show a broad range of\nIR colors.\n\n5. Photometric redshifts and SED classification\nTaking advantage of the excellent multiwavelength coverage from the optical (VVDS, CFHTLS), to near- and midinfrared (UKIDSS and SWIRE) we constructed broad band\nSEDs for all the 124 identified sources. We then fitted the\nobserved SEDs (taking into account also upper limits) with\nvarious templates in order to determine photometric redshifts. We used 20 templates that represent normal galaxies (11: 1 elliptical, 7 spirals and 3 starbursts), composite\ngalaxy + AGN (3: starburst + AGN) and AGN (6: 3 type 1\nAGN, 3 type 2 AGN) and cover the wavelength range from\n1000 \u00c5 to 500 \u03bcm. These were derived from the observed\nSEDs of objects representing the different classes. The effects of dust extinction were taken into account by reddening the reference templates according to the extinction\ncurve derived in high redshift starbursts by Calzetti et al.\n(2000). In order to limit degeneracies in the best fit solutions we limited the extinction AV to be less than 0.55\nmag and included templates of highly extincted objects\nto fit more heavily obscured sources. The HYPERZ code\n(Bolzonella et al., 2000) was used to fit the SEDs and find\nthe best-fit solution. A full description of the templates and\na detailed discussion of the SED fitting procedure and photometric redshift estimates are presented in Polletta et al.\n(2007).\nA number of spectroscopic redshifts are available to assess the quality of our photometric redshift determination.\nFor 22 objects redshifts were obtained in the context of\nthe XMM - LSS follow up programs and made available\nto us (Garcet et al., in prep.). Redshifts for two sources\nwere taken from Lacy et al. (2006), who present optical\nspectroscopy of luminous AGN selected in the mid-IR from\n\n\f8\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nsources has z < 1, with a tail extending up to z \u223c 4. These\nresults are consistent with the redshift distribution of other\nX-ray selected samples with similar or deeper flux limit (e.g.\nBarger et al., 2003; Hasinger, 2003; Barger et al., 2005).\n5.1. Spectral energy distributions and classification\n\nFig. 9. Photometric vs spectroscopic redshifts. Solid line\nis the zph = zsp relationship, dotted lines mark the 20%\n\"error\" in 1 + zph and dashed lines mark the 30% \"error\"\nin 1 + zph . Hexagons are type 1 AGN, empty squares are\ntype 2 AGN and asterisks are SGFs, as characterized by\ntheir SEDs discussed in subsection 5.1.\nSpitzer observations. For XMDS 842 a redshift is available\nfrom NED4 .\nThe VVDS spectroscopic sample (see Gavignaud et al.\n2006 for type 1 AGN) yields redshifts for 8 sources in the\npresent sample. To obtain a larger redshift comparison set,\nwe added 16 additional sources from the larger X-ray sample discussed in Paper I having a redshift from the VVDS\nspectroscopic survey. For the latter similar photometric\ndata are available so that photometric redshifts could be estimated with the same procedure described above. In total,\nthe spectroscopic comparison sample consists of 49 sources.\nFor 3 of them, falling outside the area covered by SWIRE,\nonly optical data were available for the SED.\nPhotometric and spectroscopic redshifts are compared\nin Fig. 9. The reliability and accuracy of the photometric redshifts\nare usually\nmeasured via the fractional error\n\u0011\n\u0010\nzphot \u2212zspec\nand\nthe rate of catastrophic outliers,\n\u2206z =\n1+zspec\ndefined as the fraction of sources with |\u2206z| > 0.2. For our\n49 objects, the mean \u2206z is consistent with 0.00, with a 1 \u03c3\ndispersion of 0.12, and the outlier fraction is 10%. These\nresults are significantly better than previously obtained\nfor AGN samples, where the fraction of outliers is usually\nhigher than 25% (Kitsionas et al., 2005; Babbedge et al.,\n2004). The achieved accuracy still does not allow us to\nconsider photometric redshifts as fully reliable for individual sources, however it is adequate for a statistical analysis of the population. For a more detailed discussion, see\nPolletta et al. (2007).\nThe distribution of the 124 photometric redshifts (including the optically blank fields, for which only IR fluxes\nwere used) is shown in Fig. 10. The majority (60%) of\n4\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\nAccording to the template which gives the best-fit solution,\nwe assigned sources to one of the following broad classes:\ntype 1 AGN, type 2 AGN, or SFG. The type 1 AGN class\ncorresponds to sources best-fitted with a QSO1 template.\nThe type 2 AGN class includes sources best-fitted with either the Seyfert 2 templates, or the composite AGN + starburst templates, or the QSO2 template. The SFG class includes sources fitted by a spiral or a starburst template.\nElliptical templates never yielded best fit solutions.\nExamples of observed SEDs with their best fit templates\nare presented in Fig. 11. For sources with both optical, near\nand mid-IR data, the photometric classification should be\nreliable since the SED shape of the different classes has specific signatures that can be easily identified. Interestingly,\nwhile photometric redshifts for type 1 AGN might be the\nmost uncertain, their classification is instead rather easy.\nNote however that the Seyfert 1.8 template appears intermediate between type 1 and type 2 AGN (see Fig. 11).\nThere is a large variety of SED shapes among the templates used for type 2 AGN, composite and star forming\ngalaxies. In case the fit is not optimal or when only few IR\ndata points are available, the separation between the various classes is uncertain as can be guessed comparing the\nSEDs in the left panel in Fig. 11.\nThe SED fitting procedure yields 39 type 1 AGN (32%),\n61 type 2 AGN (49%) and 24 SFG (19%).\nComparing the SED classification with the spectroscopic one, we find that all the 16 objects classified as type\n1 AGN from the fitted template indeed show broad emission lines in their optical spectra. Thus a photometric type\n1 AGN classification appears unambiguous.\nOn the other hand, there are 10 objects spectroscopically classified as type 1 AGN, which are instead not recognized as such by the SED fitting procedure, indicating that\nour method systematically underestimates the fraction of\nbroad line AGN. Specifically of the 10 misclassified objects\n8 are fitted by a Seyfert 1.8 template (all with AV close to\n0), one by a QSO 2 template and 1 by a SFG template.\nThese objects appear to be dominated by star-light emission in the optical and near-IR where the AGN continuum\ndoes not emerge clearly, although broad emission lines are\nvisible in the optical spectrum. Of the remaining 23 objects\nwithout broad lines in their optical spectra only 5 are fitted\nwith a Seyfert 1.8 template, in three cases with significant\nextinction. We conclude that SEDs fitted by Seyfert type\n1.8 templates are intermediate between type 1 and type 2\nobjects and that our method systematically underestimates\nthe objects spectroscopically classified as type 1.\nThe sources photometrically classified as SFGs do not\nshow any AGN signature at optical and IR wavelengths,\nhowever the X-ray to optical and X-ray to IR ratios and\nthe X-ray luminosity unambiguously point to the presence\nof AGN activity also in these objects.\nIn the following we will define optically \"unobscured\"\nAGN all sources fitted by a type 1 AGN template. These\nsources are expected to unambiguously correspond to broad\nline AGN. We will define all other sources (i.e. having ei-\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n9\n\nFig. 10.

As shown above, the latter group may include some\nAGN with broad emission lines, but with a SED dominated\nby the host galaxy in the near-IR. We will take into account where relevant that the number of unobscured objects should be corrected upwards by a factor 1.6 (and the\nnumber of obscured objects reduced accordingly).\nIn Fig. 12, we compare the classification based on the\nSED shape with the optical color B \u2212I as a function of redshift. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the thresh-\n\nold between blue and red sources (B \u2212 I = 1). 90% of the\nunobscured AGN have blue optical color and 84% of obscured AGN are red. Thus the simple classification based\non observed color appears in retrospect rather successful\nwhen compared with the more sophisticated template fitting procedure. However, while at z < 1.6 the SED and\n\"color\" classifications practically coincide (except for 2 obscured objects near the borderline), at larger redshifts there\nis a degeneracy among the different evolutionary tracks so\n\n\f10\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n6.1.

The two are clearly different, the first being broader and reaching higher redshifts, while the second is more concentrated at z < 1 (72%). Several authors\n(e.g. Eckart et al., 2006; Steffen et al., 2004; Treister et al.,\n2005; La Franca et al., 2005) find different redshift distributions for type 1 and non type 1 AGN. An analysis of the\nfraction of unobscured and obscured AGN as a function of\nredshift will be discussed in Section 8.\n\n6. X-ray spectral properties\nWe studied the X-ray spectral properties of our sample performing spectral fitting for individual sources with a sufficient number of counts (subsection 6.1) and a hardness ratio\nanalysis for for faint sources to obtain individual values of\nNH (subsection 6.2). A stacking technique was then used\nto study systematic trends in the whole sample (subsection 6.3). The general hardness ratio definition is\nHR =\n\nCRH \u2212 CRS\nCRH + CRS\n\n(1)\n\nwhere CRH and CRS are the count rates in the hard and\nin the soft band, respectively. In subsection 6.2 we consider\nthree hardness ratio values for each sources, HRCB , calculated using the energy bands 0.5 \u2212 2 (B) and 2 \u2212 4.5 keV\n(C), HRDC , using the energy bands 2\u22124.5 and 4.5\u221210 keV\n(D) and HR, computed between the energy bands 0.5 \u2212 2\nand 2 \u2212 10 keV.\n\nWe extracted X-ray spectra for all sources in the 3 \u03c3 hard\nsample having at least 50 net counts in the MOS + pn\nmerged image in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band. There are 55 X-ray\nsources in our catalogue which satisfy this criterion; 24 of\nthem are optically unobscured AGN, and 31 are optically\nobscured AGN.\nCounts were extracted for each source using the XMM\n- Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) evselect task\nin a circular region with a radius of 20\u2032\u2032 , corresponding,\nfor a point-like source, to an encircled energy fraction of\n\u223c 70 \u2212 75% (off-axis angles between 0 and 10\u2032 ). The pn\ndata were used, unless the source was close to a CCD gap,\nin which case we used the MOS data, fitting simultaneously\nMOS1 and MOS2. Background counts were extracted from\nthe nearest source free region, excluding areas near gaps in\nthe CCD array. We used the SAS rmfgen task to create\nresponse matrices (one for each camera and each XMDS\npointing) and arfgen to generate ancillary response files\n(one for each source).\nX-ray spectra were analyzed using the XSPEC package\n(v. 11.3.1). We considered the energy range 0.3 \u2212 10 keV.\nWhen the number of counts was large enough, data were\nbinned in order to have at least 15 or 20 counts for each\nenergy channel and \u03c72 statistics was used, otherwise we\nused Cash statistics (Cash, 1979), which, however, does not\ngive a \"goodness of fit\" evaluation, like the \u03c72 . In order to\nbetter match the spectral resolution of the instruments, we\nbinned the data of these sources with few counts using a\nfixed number of PHA channels before fitting using the Cash\nstatistics.\nWe first fitted the spectra using a simple power law\nmodel with galactic absorption computed at the XMDS\nposition (NH = 2.6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , Dickey & Lockman,\n1990), plus a component for intrinsic absorption at z = 0\n(XSPEC model: phabs*zphabs*pow with abundance table\nof Wilms et al., 2000).\nFor all spectra for which \u03c72 statistics can be used in\nthe fit (22 sources), we set both intrinsic column density\nand photon index as free parameters. Spectral fit results\nare reported in Table B.1 in Appendix B. The errors in\nTables and Figures correspond to the 90% confidence level\nfor one interesting parameter. The average photon index\nis \u0393 \u223c 2.1 and NH < 21 cm \u22122 . This is consistent with\ntheir location in the hardness ratio plot, where they cluster\naround HRCB = \u22120.5 and HRDC = \u22120.5 (see Table B.1\nand subsection 6.2). Therefore they cannot be considered\nrepresentative of the whole sample.\nSince more than half of the X-ray spectra in the sample do not have a sufficient number of counts to perform\na fit with both \u0393 and NH free parameters, we fixed the\nphoton index for all objects, in order to obtain an estimate of the column density. We used two different values\nof the photon index, \u0393 = 2.0 and \u0393 = 1.7, both appropriate for AGN (Turner & Pounds, 1989; Nandra & Pounds,\n1994). Spectral fit results for the simple absorbed power\nlaw model for each source with both \u0393 = 2.0 and \u0393 = 1.7\nare reported in Table B.2 in Appendix B, where we also\nlist the sources with peculiar fits. The best fit values of NH\nobtained with \u0393 = 2.0 are higher than those obtained with\nphoton index frozen to 1.7, by about \u2206log(NH ) = 0.2. The\ntwo column density estimates are consistent within errors\nin 90% of cases.\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 13. Intrinsic column density vs photometric or spectroscopic redshift. Empty diamonds are optically unobscured AGN, filled diamonds are optically obscured AGN.\n\nWe will consider in the following only the distribution\nobtained fixing \u0393 = 2.0, except for two sources (XMDS 124\nand 779): in these two cases we were able to find a stable solution only fixing the photon index to \u0393 = 1.7. The column\ndensity distributions of optically obscured and unobscured\nAGN turn out to be different: 16% of unobscured AGN (3\nout of 19) have NH > 1021 cm\u22122 , while more than 55% of\nobscured AGN (19 out of 34) have NH > 1021 cm\u22122 . We recall that these are lower limits to the column density values,\nsince we did not yet introduce the redshift dependence.\nFinally, we introduced the photometric or spectroscopic\nredshift, when available, in order to compute the intrinsic\ncolumn density. The photon index was left free when the\n\u03c72 statistics could be used, otherwise it was fixed to 2.0.\nSpectral fit results, along with redshifts, are reported in\nTable B.2 in Appendix B. Again, the distributions for optically obscured and unobscured AGN are different, with 63%\nof obscured AGN (19 out of 30) having NH > 1021 cm\u22122\nand 36% (11 out of 30) with NH > 1022 cm\u22122 . For comparison, only \u223c 20% of unobscured AGN (4 out of 21) have\nNH > 1021 cm\u22122 and 10% (2 out of 21) have NH > 1022\ncm\u22122 .\nIn Fig. 13 the intrinsic column density is shown as a\nfunction of redshift; this figure is qualitatively consistent\nwith those presented in other surveys (e.g. Eckart et al.,\n2006) and shows no obvious trend with z, although we also\nnotice the paucity of high redshift sources with well constrained measures of NH .\n6.2. X-ray absorption\nThe two hardness ratios HRCB and HRDC defined above\nare compared in Fig. 14. As expected, most sources lie along\nthe values expected for a single power law model. We further distinguish obscured/unobscured sources with different symbols. Less than 10% of the objects classified as op-\n\n11\n\nFig. 14. X-ray color - color plot for sources in the 3 \u03c3 hard\nsample. Energy bands involved are: 0.5 \u2212 2 (B), 2 \u2212 4.5 (C)\nand 4.5 \u2212 10 keV (D). Sources are classified as optically unobscured AGN (empty diamonds) or obscured AGN (filled\ndiamonds). We also mark the hardness ratios computed for\na simple absorbed power law spectral model, with \u0393 = 2\nand logNH = 21, 22, 23 for z = 0 (four point stars connected by the solid line, from left to right) and logNH =\n22, 23, 24 for z = 1 (five points stars connected by the\ndashed line, from left to right).\n\ntically unobscured AGN have HRCB > \u22120.3 (NH \u223c 1021.5\nat z = 0), while more than 40% of the sources classified as\nobscured AGN have HRCB > \u22120.3 indicating that X-ray\nabsorption and an obscured classification are often associated.\nFor a quantitative estimate of the absorbing column\nNH we used the results of the spectral fits described in\nSection 6.1 with \u0393 fixed to 2.0 for the 51 brightest sources\nand computed the column density from the X-ray hardness\nratios in the remaining cases in the following way.\nWe used the standard hardness ratio HR, computed between the 2 \u2212 10 and the 0.5 \u2212 2 keV bands. We made\nsimulations using XSPEC to obtain hardness ratios corresponding to typical values of NH ranging from 1020 to\n1024 cm\u22122 . A simple power law model with photon index\n\u0393 = 2.0 was assumed, consistently with the model used\nfor the X-ray spectral analysis. The simulations and the\nobjects for which a spectrum could be extracted define a\nclear relationship between NH and HR for HR > \u22120.5,\nwhile, below these values, the HR - NH relation degenerates. We therefore fixed the latter value, corresponding to\nNH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 , as a threshold below which all column\ndensities are fixed to the galactic value. By interpolation we\ncomputed the observed NH corresponding to the hardness\nratio of each source. The intrinsic column density was then\nobtained from the observed one using the photometric (or\nspectroscopic, when available) redshift and the expression\n2.6\nNintr\n= Nobs\n(Barger et al., 2002), also when the\nH (1 + z)\nH\nobserved column density was estimated from the spectrum\n\n\f12\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 15. Distribution of observed (left panel) and intrinsic (right panel) column densities. Solid histogram refers to the\nwhole sample, dotted and dashed histograms refer to optically unobscured AGN and optically obscured AGN, respectively.\n(i.e. in this cases we did not use the Nintr\nobtained by the\nH\nXSPEC and reported in Table B.2, but we recomputed it\nfrom the observed value, in order to be more consistent with\nthe column density estimates obtained from HR). Nintr\nwas\nH\nnot computed when the observed column density was fixed\nat the galactic value.\nThe observed and intrinsic column density distributions\nare reported in Fig. 15. Different lines (dotted/dashed) refer to the NH distribution for optically unobscured and obscured AGN respectively. Unfortunately, our choice of setting a fixed value for low NH creates an artificial gap in\nthe distribution. The majority of optically obscured AGN\nare X-ray absorbed (Nintr\n> 1022 cm\u22122 ), as expected.\nH\nWe find that also 12 unobscured AGN (more than 30%)\nhave Nintr\n> 1022 cm\u22122 . It is well known that NH values\nH\nare less well constrained with increasing redshifts (see e.g.\nEckart et al., 2006; Akylas et al., 2006; Tozzi et al., 2006),\nsince the absorption cut - off shifts to lower energies and becomes comparable to the galactic values or even drops out\n22\nof the observed band. For z >\n\u223c 1.5, an intrinsic NH of 10\n\u22122\n21\n<\ncm\ncorresponds to an observed column density \u223c 10\ncm\u22122 . Unobscured AGN, whose hardness ratios generally\ncluster around \u22120.5 (which corresponds to Nobs\n\u223c 1021\nH\n\u22122\ncm ), are more severely affected by this problem than obscured AGN, which have a broader HR distribution. We\nhave partially compensated for this effect with our choice\nof fixing intrinsic columns to 0 when the observed hardness\nratio HR \u223c \u22120.5. Moreover, we have at least 4 examples of\noptically unobscured AGN (XMDS 12, 258, 280 and 406) in\nwhich the observed NH is already larger than NH = 5\u00d71021\ncm\u22122 , ensuring that the large columns are not all to be attributed to the redshift effects.\nOn the other hand, among the objects for which we are\nnot able to estimate the column density (those with NH\nfixed at the galactic value), there could be some which could\nbe really X-ray absorbed. In Fig. 16 we show the intrinsic\ncolumn density of our objects as a function of redshift. The\nsolid line shows the intrinsic NH values that would be derived at a given redshift, for an observed column density of\n1021 cm\u22122 . Since the objects with HR < \u22120.5 should have\n21\nNobs\ncm\u22122 , their intrinsic column density should lie\nH < 10\nbelow the solid line in Figure. It is therefore possible that\nwe underestimate the number of X-ray absorbed objects\n\nFig. 16. Intrinsic column density vs photometric (or spectroscopic, when available) redshift. Empty diamonds are\noptically unobscured AGN and filled diamonds are optically\nobscured AGN. The dashed line marks the threshold between X-ray absorbed (NH > 1022 cm\u22122 ) and unabsorbed\nsources. The solid line shows the intrinsic column density\nthat would be derived at a given redshift, for a measured\ncolumn density of 1021 cm\u22122 in the observer frame.\n\nfor redshift z >\n\u223c 1.5 (where the solid and dashed line cross).\nThe column densities are therefore difficult to estimate at\nhigh redshift, but this should not affect our results.\n6.3.

This value allows us to obtain\na significant number of sources (83), for which calibration\nshould be still reliable. 30 sources are optically unobscured\nAGN and 53 are optically obscured AGN.\nWe restricted the source area to a fixed radius of 15\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhich, on-axis, corresponds to 67% of the encircled energy\nfor a point-like source. Since with this radius we sample the\nPSF core and not the wings, the encircled energy fraction\nhas a weak dependence on the off-axis angle (at \u03b8 = 10\u2032\n67% of the encircled energy is within a 16\u2032\u2032 radius) and the\nenergy dependence can also be neglected. Therefore, we can\nconsider all sources together regardless of their position in\nthe field. A background spectrum was extracted for each\nsource in a circle of radius 80\u2032\u2032 in the nearest source free\nregion. Ancillary response files were also produced for each\nsource, while, as for single spectra analysis, we used one\nresponse matrix for each XMM - Newton pointing.\nThe sample used in the stacking analysis covers a flux\nrange from about 10\u221214 to 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ; we\ndivided it in 5 flux bins, chosen to have a sufficient number\nof counts in each bin (see Table 1; on average, brighter\nsources have a greater number of counts, so in the higher\nflux bins a smaller number of sources is included).\nThe spectra within the same flux bin were added using\nthe mathpha task of ftools to produce a single spectral file.\nThe same was done for background files. The auxiliary and\nresponse files were combined using the addarf and addrmf\ntasks of ftools, respectively. The combined spectra were\ngrouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin and were analyzed using XSPEC.\nWe fitted the stacked spectra in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV range\nusing a single power law model with column density fixed\nto the galactic value. The fit results are reported in Table 1.\nThe \u0393 values obtained for the whole sample are consistent\nwithin errors with \u0393 = 1.7 \u2212 1.8 in all the flux bins.\nWe then considered the optically unobscured and obscured AGN separately. We divided them in 4 bins, using\ntwo slightly different binnings for the two subsamples dictated by the available statistics. The results are reported\nin Table 2 and the photon index as a function of flux is\nshown in Fig. 17. The difference between the optically unobscured and obscured AGN populations is evident: for\nthe unobscured AGN the measured photon index is con-\n\nFig. 17.

No\nsignificant dependence of the spectral index with flux is\nfound for optically unobscured or optically obscured AGN.\nGeorgakakis et al. (2006) merged the X-ray spectra of\nhard X-ray sources detected by XMM - Newton at F2\u22128 >\n2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and having an optical counterpart in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al., 2000)\nwith red color (g \u2212 r > 0.4). They found that the stacked\nspectrum of these sources has a spectral slope of \u0393 =\n1.47 \u00b1 0.04 (sources observed with the THIN filter), consistent with that of the XRB (\u0393 \u223c 1.4, Gendreau et al., 1995;\nChen et al., 1997; Vecchi et al., 1999). As shown in the previous Sections, optically obscured AGN generally have red\noptical color and the average spectral slope obtained for obscured AGN is only slightly higher than that of red objects\nof Georgakakis et al. (2006), showing that we are sampling\nsimilar populations.\nAccording to Worsley et al. (2005), whilst the XRB is\n\u223c 85% and \u223c 80% resolved in the 0.5 \u2212 2 and 2 \u2212 10 keV\nbands respectively, it is only \u223c 60% resolved above \u223c 6 keV\nand \u223c 50% resolved above \u223c 8 keV. The missing population should be made of faint, heavily obscured AGN located\nat redshift of \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1.5, and with intrinsic absorption of\n\u223c 1023 \u2212 1024 cm\u22122 . As noted in Section 5, the sources\nclassified as SFG do not show any AGN signature in the\noptical and IR. We also find that the fraction of X-ray absorbed sources in the SFG class (\u223c 67%, 16 out of 24) is\nlarger than that of X-ray absorbed sources in the type 2\nAGN class (\u223c 54%, 33 out of 61). Thus sources belonging\nto this class appear to be good candidates to be responsible\n\n\f14\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\nOptically unobscured AGN\nFlux bins\nN. of sources\n\u221214.1 < logFX < \u221213.6\n12\n\u221213.6 < logFX < \u221213.5\n8\n\u221213.5 < logFX < \u221213.3\n7\n\u221213.3 < logFX < \u221212.9\n3\n\n\u0393\n1.91+0.12\n\u22120.12\n2.04+0.09\n\u22120.09\n1.85+0.11\n\u22120.10\n2.13+0.21\n\u22120.20\n\nOptically obscured AGN\nFlux bins\nN. of sources\n\u221214.1 < logFX < \u221213.7\n16\n\u221213.7 < logFX < \u221213.6\n19\n\u221213.6 < logFX < \u221213.4\n12\n\u221213.4 < logFX < \u221212.9\n6\nSFGs\n\u221214.1 < logFX < \u221213.6\n7\n\u221213.6 < logFX < \u221212.9\n6\n\n\u0393\n1.60+0.10\n\u22120.09\n1.75+0.07\n\u22120.07\n1.57+0.09\n\u22120.08\n1.49+0.10\n\u22120.09\n1.33+0.17\n\u22120.16\n1.21+0.11\n\u22120.10\n\nTable 2. Mean spectral properties from the stacking analysis of optically unobscured, optically obscured AGN and of\nthe subclass of SFG objects. NH is fixed to the galactic value.\n\nfor the XRB in the harder X-ray range. We therefore applied the stacking analysis to study separately the spectral\nproperties of the SFG population in our sample.\nOnly 13 SFGs are detected in the pn at off-axis angle\n< 11\u2032 , so we grouped them in two flux bins. The spectral\nfits of the SFG stacked spectra give \u0393 \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.3, with no\nsignificant differences in the two bins (Table 2 and crosses\nin Fig. 17). Therefore the average spectra of the SFGs are\nharder than those of optically obscured AGN (type 2 +\nSFGs) and even harder than the XRB spectrum in the\nsame band. If the population responsible for the high energy XRB has the same SED properties as the SFG objects\ndiscussed in this work, they might go unidentified as AGN\neven in the IR, where they look like star forming galaxies.\nA more detailed discussion about this topic is presented in\nPolletta et al. (2007).\n\n7. The surface density of optically obscured and\nunobscured AGN\nIn Paper I we computed the logN-logS distribution for all\nthe sources detected with a probability of false detection\nP < 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 in the 0.5 \u2212 2 and 2 \u2212 10 keV bands; for\nthe 2 \u2212 10 keV band, this probability threshold is slightly\nlower than the 3 \u03c3 threshold chosen for the present sample,\ntherefore all the sources of the 3 \u03c3 hard sample were included in the logN-logS. We used the differential logN-logS\nfor the 2 \u2212 10 keV band reported in Paper I, computed the\nfraction of optically unobscured and obscured AGN in each\nflux bin from the present sample and rescaled the logN-logS\nrelationship accordingly. We made the reasonable assumption that the fraction of optically obscured and unobscured\nAGN should be the same in the area covered by the VVDS\nas well as in the whole XMDS area.\nThe differential logN-logS relationships for optically obscured and unobscured AGN are shown in Fig. 18. The errors are the combination of the errors on the original logNlogS with those on the fractions, according to the error\npropagation formula. The two logN-logS are quite similar,\nexcept for the faintest fluxes, where the density of the optically unobscured AGN is significantly lower (by a factor of\n\u223c 4.6) than that of optically obscured AGN. Considering\nthe cumulative logN-logS instead of the differential one, we\ncan give an estimate of the integral surface density of optically obscured and unobscured AGN at F > 10\u221214 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . We find 138 and 59 sources deg\u22122 , respectively,\nand the ratio between optically obscured and unobscured\nAGN is \u223c 2.3 for the whole flux range covered. The ratio\nwould decrease from 2.3 to 1.1 if we assume that the frac-\n\nFig. 18. Differential logN-logS for unobscured (empty diamonds) and obscured AGN (filled diamonds). The units of\nn(F ) are number per 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122 . Vertical\nbars show the error on the number of sources, while the\nhorizontal bars show the flux bin width.\n\ntion of unobscured AGN should be corrected by a factor of\n1.6 (see subsection 5.1).\nWe compared these values with the surface densities\nof broad line and non broad line AGN, estimated by\nBauer et al. (2004) in their study of the Chandra Deep\nFields. We obtained values from their Fig. 4 and 8. At\nF2\u221210 > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , the surface densities differ\nby a factor of \u223c 2. This discrepancy is a consequence of the\nfact that the logN-logS computed in Paper I is lower than\nthat of Bauer et al. (2004). As discussed in Paper I, the\nXMDS logN-logS is slightly lower than those of Baldi et al.\n(2002) and Moretti et al. (2003) for F2\u221210 > 2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , but consistent within the errors. Instead, the\nBauer et al. (2004) surface density for fluxes F2\u22128 \u223c 10\u221214\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 is slightly higher than that obtained by\nMoretti et al. (2003). Since all these surveys refer to small\nconnected areas in different parts of the sky, it is possible\nthat the differences in the derived number counts may be\ndue to cosmic variance.\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 19. X-ray (2 \u2212 10 keV) absorption corrected luminosity vs intrinsic column density. Empty diamonds are\noptically unobscured AGN and filled diamonds are optically obscured AGN. Encircled points are objects with\nFX /FR > 40. The dashed lines mark the region where type\n2 QSOs should be found.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bauer et al. (2004) ratio of non\nbroad line and broad line AGN at F \u223c 10\u221214 is \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2,\nintermediate between our values of 2.3 and 1.1. These authors describe some caveats about their AGN classification\ncriteria, and point out that their number counts of broad\nline AGN must be considered a lower limit and that of non\nbroad line AGN an upper limit, so that their non broad\nline/broad line AGN ratio could approach our lower estimate.\n7.1. Type 2 QSO candidates\nWe searched for type 2 QSO candidates in the 3 \u03c3 hard\nsample. In the X-ray domain the type 2 QSO population is characterized by high intrinsic absorption (NH >\n1022 cm\u22122 ) and high X-ray luminosity (LX > 1044 erg\ns\u22121 ). Since locally (in the Seyfert luminosity regime) Xray absorbed AGN are 4 times more numerous than unabsorbed ones (Maiolino & Rieke, 1995; Risaliti et al., 1999),\naccording to the unified AGN model, one would expect\nthat the same should be true at high luminosities and\nredshifts, i.e. in the QSO regime. A still undiscovered\nlarge population of obscured AGN is indeed predicted\nby X-ray background synthesis models (e.g. Gilli et al.,\n2001; Franceschini et al., 2002; Gandhi & Fabian, 2003;\nUeda et al., 2003; Worsley et al., 2005). Before the advent of Chandra and XMM - Newton, only a few type\n2 QSOs were known (see e.g. Akiyama et al., 1998;\nDella Ceca et al., 2000; Franceschini et al., 2000). Deep Xray surveys found indeed a large fraction of the objects\nto be obscured (e.g. Barger et al., 2003; Mainieri et al.,\n2002), but the number of identified type 2 QSOs is still\nvery low compared to the model predictions. A signifi-\n\n15\n\ncant fraction of high - z, obscured QSOs may have escaped optical spectroscopic identification due to the weakness of their optical counterparts and misclassification due\nto the lack of AGN signature. On the other hand, medium\ndeep X-ray surveys, covering relatively large sky areas at\na higher flux limit, proved to be effective to select significant samples of type 2 QSO candidates among objects\nwith high values of the X-ray to optical ratio (FX /FR >\n10, see Fiore et al., 2003). Recent findings also suggest a\nconnection between Extremely Red Objects (EROs, R \u2212\nK > 5 in the Vega system) and type 2 QSOs (see e.g.\nBrusa et al., 2005; Severgnini et al., 2005, and references\ntherein). Maiolino et al. (2006) suggest that by selecting\nextreme values of FX /FR (> 40) and extreme values of\nR \u2212 K(> 6), the type 2 QSO selection efficiency may approach 100%.\nThe absorption corrected X-ray luminosity is shown as\na function of the intrinsic column density in Fig. 19. There\nis a significant number of objects (34 out of 124) having\nLX > 1044 erg s\u22121 and NH > 1022 cm\u22122 in our sample. 12\nof them (35%) are classified as unobscured AGN, while the\nremaining 22 are classified as obscured AGN, based on the\nSED classification. We verified that these objects generally\nhave high X-ray to optical ratios, in particular 21 of the\n25 X-ray sources in the 3 \u03c3 sample having FX /FR > 10\nhave NH > 1022 cm\u22122 and L2\u221210 > 1044 erg s\u22121 . On the\nother hand, while for the optically unobscured AGN the\nfraction of high luminosity, X-ray absorbed sources having\nFX /FR > 10 is only 25% (3 out of 12), this fraction is 77%\n(17 out of 22) for the obscured ones.\nAll the 8 objects with FX /FR > 40 (the threshold\nused by Maiolino et al., 2006) satisfy the X-ray definition\nof a type 2 QSO (see encircled objects in Fig. 19). All\nare optically obscured. These results confirm that type 2\nQSO candidates are found between the high X-ray to optical ratio population and that the threshold proposed by\nMaiolino et al. (2006) is highly efficient in finding type 2\nQSOs but it is far from exhaustive (i.e. many type 2 QSOs\nhave FX /FR < 40).\nIn Fig. 20 the color between VVDS R band and SWIRE\n4.5 \u03bcm band is shown as a function of redshift for the type 2\nQSO candidates. Objects fitted by a type 1 AGN template\nhave generally blue colors. About 70% of the candidates fitted by a type 2 AGN or a SFG template have extremely red\ninfrared/optical flux ratios, as observed in extremely obscured AGN and similar to those observed in spectroscopically confirmed type 2 QSOs at high redshift (z = 1.5 \u2212 2.5,\nsee Severgnini et al., 2006; Polletta et al., 2006). We have\nK magnitudes from the UKIDSS Early Data Release or\nfrom the VVDS for 18 objects: 4 of them are EROs, all\nhaving FX /FR > 40 and all fitted by a type 2 AGN or a\nSFG template. Given the blue optical/IR colors of the optically unobscured AGN, we exclude them from the type\n2 QSO candidates. Therefore the sample of type 2 QSOs\nreduces to 22 objects. One of them (XMDS 55) has been\nindeed spectroscopically confirmed as a type 2 object (see\nGarcet et al. in prep.). The type 2 QSO candidates represent (18 \u00b1 4)% of the sources in the 3 \u03c3 hard sample and\nhave X-ray fluxes in the range 1 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nAs done before for optically obscured and unobscured\nAGN, we rescaled the surface density of X-ray sources at\nF2\u221210 > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to the type 2 QSO fraction to estimate the type 2 QSOs surface density. It results (35 \u00b1 8) deg\u22122 , lower but consistent, within errors,\n\n\f16\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nFig. 20.

(2007) in the\nHELLAS2XMM at the same flux level.\nThe type 2 QSO population represents about 35% of all\nhigh luminosity sources (LX > 1044 erg s\u22121 ) in our sample. For comparison, according to Perola et al. (2004), in\nthe HELLAS2XMM the fraction of X-ray absorbed sources\n(NH > 1022 cm\u22122 ) in the high luminosity (LX > 1044 erg\ns\u22121 ) AGN population would be between 28% and 40%.\n\n8. Discussion\n8.1. Optical Obscuration vs X-ray Absorption\nThe wide and well sampled multiwavelength coverage from\nthe optical through the mid-IR allowed us to use the photometric approach to redshift determination and classification\nin a very effective way. The comparison with a spectroscopic\nsample gives us confidence in the estimated redshifts and\nin the fact that a photometric type 1 classification is unambiguous, but reveals a bias against the recognition of a number of broad line objects as type 1 SEDs. This is due to the\ncoexistence of Seyfert 1.8 type SEDs with the presence of\nbroad line emission. Since we adopt here the SED classification, these objects will be considered \"optically obscured\".\nIn optically obscured objects the optical-UV emission from\nthe AGN may be either dimmed by intervening dust or be\nweaker than that of the host. In this sense, \"red quasars\"\n(Wilkes et al., 2002; Gregg et al., 2002; Glikman et al.,\n2004; Urrutia et al., 2005; Wilkes et al., 2005) would be\nclassified here as obscured objects.\nThe X-ray data give us an independent and complementary information essential to identify AGN where the\nnuclear X-ray emission is heavily absorbed, and AGN features may be completely hidden both in the optical and IR\n\nbands, as in the case of sources identified with SFGs. In the\nfollowing we discuss the trends of optical obscuration and\nX-ray absorption within our sample separately, in order to\nexplore to what extent the two are associated.\nThe sample contains 39 optically unobscured AGN and\n83 optically obscured AGN (of which 22 best fitted by a\nSFG template). The two sources with X-ray to optical ratios and luminosities typical of normal galaxies are excluded\nfrom this analysis. The X-ray absorbed AGN are 60. X-ray\nabsorption occurs in 48 of the 83 obscured AGN (of which\n16 are SFGs). The remaining 12 X-ray absorbed AGN are\nclassified as unobscured on the basis of their SEDs. We\nconclude that X-ray absorption is commonly but not exclusively associated with obscuration since 30% of the unobscured AGN are X-ray absorbed.\nThe numbers of optically unobscured, optically obscured and X-ray absorbed AGN in different flux, redshift\nand luminosity bins are given in Table 3, where we also\nreport separately the number of X-ray absorbed sources\nwithin the optically unobscured and obscured AGN respectively.\nThe fractions of obscured/absorbed AGN in our sample\nare shown in Fig. 21 as a function of observed flux, redshift\nand absorption corrected hard X-ray luminosity. The left\npanels refer to optically obscured and unobscured AGN,\nwhile the right panels refer to X-ray absorbed (Nintr\n> 1022\nH\ncm\u22122 ) and unabsorbed AGN, irrespectively of their SED\nclassification.\nWe used the Bayesian statistics to estimate the \"true\nvalue\" of the fractions and their errors (68% credible interval, see Andreon et al., 2006, and references therein) and\nto evaluate the reliability of the suggested correlations. We\ntested whether existing data support a model in which the\nfraction 1) is constant or 2) has a linear dependence with\nredshift, flux or luminosity, by computing the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC, Schwartz 1978; an astronomical introduction to it can be found in Liddle 2004) for both\nmodels and then the difference \u2206BIC between the BICs of\nthe two models. A \u2206BIC of 6 or more can be used to reject\nthe model with the largest value of BIC, whereas a value\nbetween 2 and 6 is only suggestive (Jeffreys, 1961). We also\ncompared the trends of optically obscured and X-ray absorbed AGN using the same criterion.\nObscured sources are dominant in the lowest flux bin\n(79+0.10\n\u22120.08 %, upper left panel), although a systematic trend\nof optically obscured AGN to decrease with X-ray flux is not\nestablished (\u2206BIC = 0.7). This result was already apparent from the logN-logS curves, where the surface density of\noptically obscured AGN largely exceeds that of unobscured\nobjects in the lowest flux interval (F < 2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 ), see Fig. 18. The fraction of X-ray absorbed AGN (upper right panel) is also higher at the faintest fluxes and\nthere is a positive indication that it changes systematically\nwith flux (\u2206BIC = 4.9).\nThe fraction of optically obscured AGN shows instead a\nsteep decrease as a function of redshift (middle left panel),\nfrom \u223c 90% at z < 0.5 to \u223c 30% at z > 2, and the\ntrend is highly significant (\u2206BIC = 26.3). Similarly, the\ndata strongly support a decrease of the fraction of optically\nobscured AGN with luminosity (lower left panel, \u2206BIC =\n23.9). The two trends are not independent, since in flux\nlimited surveys a correlation between luminosity and redshift is expected. For X-ray absorbed AGN, data suggest\nconstancy with both redshift and luminosity. In summary\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\n17\n\nBins\n\nNH > 1022\nOpt. Unobsc. Opt.

Total number of sources, number of optically unobscured and optically obscured AGN, number of X-ray\nabsorbed AGN (NH > 1022 cm\u22122 ), and number of optically unobscured and obscured AGN among X-ray absorbed AGN\nin each X-ray flux, redshift and absorption corrected X-ray luminosity bin (see text and Fig. 21). Fluxes are in erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 , luminosities are in erg s\u22121 .\n\nthere is evidence that the trends of optically obscured and\nX-ray absorbed AGN are different both as a function of\nredshift (\u2206BIC = 17.5) and luminosity (\u2206BIC = 20.1), the\nformer showing a decrease with redshift and luminosity, the\nlatter being essentially constant.\n8.2. Comparison with the literature\nSeveral authors compute the fraction of X-ray absorbed\nor optically obscured AGN as a function of all or some of\nthe quantities described above, however in the literature a\ndetailed comparison between optical obscuration and X-ray\nabsorption seems to be lacking.\nThe trends of broad line AGN as a function of\nredshift and X-ray luminosity are explored e.g by\nSteffen et al. (2003), Barger et al. (2005), Treister & Urry\n(2005), Tozzi et al. (2006), who use data from the Chandra\nDeep Fields, in some cases complemented by shallower\nChandra observations. All these samples reach flux levels\nsignificantly deeper than ours thus probing the AGN population in more depth; given this, we limit ourselves to a\nqualitative comparison. Assuming that unobscured AGN\ncorrespond to broad line AGN, the trends presented by the\nabove authors are in agreement with those shown in the\nmiddle and lower left panels of Fig. 21.\nWe examined in more detail the data of the\nHELLAS2XMM 1df (Fiore et al., 2003; Perola et al., 2004)\nand of the Serendipitous Extragalactic X-ray Source\nIdentification (SEXSI, Eckart et al., 2006), whose flux limits and areas are comparable to those of the XMDS. For the\nHELLAS2XMM, we computed the fraction of optically obscured AGN using all the sources for which a spectroscopic\nclassification is available (their samples S1, S2 and S4).\nConsistently with our classification scheme, we grouped\ntogether the objects spectroscopically classified as type 2\nAGN, emission line galaxies (ELGs) and early type galaxies (ETGs), considering them as optically obscured AGN.\nWe did the same for the SESXI data, considering as optically obscured AGN all sources spectroscopically classified\nas narrow line AGN (NLAGN), ELGs and absorption line\n\ngalaxies (ALGs). Broad line AGN are instead classified as\noptically unobscured.\nWe computed the fractions in the HELLAS2XMM and\nSEXSI using the Bayesian statistics, as done for our sample. We find that also in the HELLAS2XMM and SEXSI\ncases the fraction of optically obscured AGN decreases (and\nconversely the fraction of optically unobscured AGN increases) with redshift and luminosity. We notice that in the\nHELLAS2XMM survey the fraction of unobscured AGN is\nlarger by a factor of \u223c 3 than ours, for redshifts z < 1.5,\nwhile it is consistent with ours at higher redshifts. The\nagreement with the SEXSI survey is instead better. The\nspectroscopic completeness is however about 90% for the\nHELLAS2XMM, while it ranges from 40% to 70% for the\nSEXSI. The larger fractions of type 1 AGN in spectroscopic\nsamples are expected, given the differences between photometric and spectroscopic classifications discussed above,\nhowever the fraction of type 1 AGN in the HELLAS2XMM\nis still larger than ours even when the correction factor computed in subsection 5.1 is taken into account. Nevertheless,\nthe trends observed in spectroscopic samples are consistent\nwith ours.\nThe X-ray properties (fraction of AGN with NH > 1022\n\u22122\ncm ) are explored by a number of authors who use XMM\n- Newton or Chandra data of similar depth (flux limit\nof \u223c 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , see e.g. Piconcelli et al., 2003;\nPerola et al., 2004; Eckart et al., 2006; Akylas et al., 2006)\nand a quantitative comparison with their results is possible. Taking into account the different selection criteria and\ncorrections that the different authors apply to the data, we\nfind agreement within the errors with the results reported\nhere.\nAgain, we concentrated in particular on the results obtained in the HELLAS2XMM and in the SEXSI surveys.\nBoth Perola et al. (2004) and Eckart et al. (2006) show\nthat the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGN increases with\ndecreasing X-ray flux, even if the trends are significant\nonly when X-ray fluxes as faint as 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\nare considered. In our flux range, we are consistent with\nthe HELLAS2XMM and SEXSI values. Perola et al. (2004)\n\n\f18\n\nTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\nand Eckart et al. (2006) also find that there is no evidence\nof a dependence of the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGN on\nluminosity. Again, these results are consistent with ours,\nwith a better quantitative agreement with the SEXSI than\nwith the HELLAS2XMM survey (for example, the fraction\nof X-ray absorbed AGN is between \u223c 0.4 and \u223c 0.6 in our\ncase and in the SEXSI, while it is between \u223c 0.2 and \u223c 0.4\nin the HELLAS2XMM).\nIn conclusion, the analysis of our, the HELLAS2XMM\nand the SEXSI data indicates that the percentages of optically obscured and X-ray absorbed AGN within the same\nsample show different dependences on redshift and X-ray\nluminosity. Recent models which describe the cosmological evolution of the AGN space density, such as those\nof Ueda et al. (2003) and La Franca et al. (2005), predict\nthat the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGN decreases with\nluminosity, and increase with redshift, in the case of the\nLa Franca et al. (2005) model. The combination of a decrease in luminosity and an increase with redshift within a\nsingle flux limited sample, where the redshift and luminosity dependences tend to compensate each other, may well\nbe the explanation underlying the observed \"constancy\"\nwith redshift and luminosity of the absorbed AGN fraction\nin our data. In fact, La Franca et al. (2005) point out that\nthe result of the opposite trends in LX and z leads to an\napparent constancy of the X-ray absorbed fraction of AGN.\nOnly by combining several samples and thus covering wide\nstrips of the LX \u2212 z plane with almost constant redshift\nor luminosity is it possible to disentangle the true dependences.\nOn the other hand, in a recent analysis of the XMM\n- Newton observation of the Chandra Deep Field South,\nDwelly & Page (2006) do not find any dependence of the Xray absorbed AGN fraction on redshift and luminosity and\nsuggest that the trends observed by other authors could be\nthe result of using deep X-ray data from Chandra, which\ncould be biased against high redshift X-ray absorbed AGN.\nTherefore the redshift and luminosity dependence of X-ray\nabsorption in the AGN population is still an open issue.\nIn any case, the different redshift and luminosity dependences observed for optically obscured and X-ray absorbed AGN imply that in a significant number of objects\nobscuration and absorption are not strictly related, moreover the relation depends on redshift/luminosity in a systematic way.\n8.3. Objects with different absorption properties\nThere is a number of examples in the literature of objects that have opposite X-ray and optical properties,\nsuch as X-ray absorbed type 1 AGN (e.g. Comastri et al.,\n2001; Brusa et al., 2003; Akiyama et al., 2003) or X-ray\nunabsorbed type 2 AGN (e.g. Panessa & Bassani, 2002;\nCaccianiga et al., 2004; Wolter et al., 2005), however it is\nnot clear so far how common these exceptions are and how\nthey can be reconciled with the unified model (Antonucci,\n1993). Perola et al. (2004) find that about 10% of broad\nline AGN are X-ray absorbed, while Tozzi et al. (2006) estimate that the correspondence of unabsorbed (absorbed)\nX-ray sources to optical type 1 (type 2) AGN is accurate for\nat least 80% of the sources. We address this question in the\nfollowing subsections, where instead of type 1 and type 2\nAGN as derived from the optical spectra, we will consider\n\noptically obscured and unobscured AGN as derived from\nthe SED classification.\n8.3.1. X-ray absorption without optical obscuration\nWe find 12 X-ray absorbed, optically unobscured AGN,\n31% of all unobscured AGN. In 7 cases, the fit requires\nadditional extinction, AV =0.40\u20130.55, but lower than that\nwould be derived from the column density in the X-ray\nspectral fits assuming the standard dust-to-gas ratio. The\ndiscrepancy between optical and X-ray properties can be\nexplained e.g. by a dust-to-gas ratio lower than the Galactic\nvalue (Maiolino et al., 2001) or by a different path of the\nline of sights to the X-ray and the optical sources (e.g. see\ndual absorber model in Risaliti et al. 2000 or torus clumpy\nmodel, Hoenig et al. 2006). Another possibility is that in\nsome objects the absorbing gas is ionized rather than neutral: in that case, dust would likely be absent and the intrinsic continuum plus broad emission lines would be observed\nin the optical spectrum of the AGN. Examples of broad\nline AGN whose X-ray spectra show absorption well fitted\nby an ionized absorber model are reported in Page et al.\n(2006).\n8.3.2. Optical obscuration without X-ray absorption\n35 out of 83 optically obscured sources do not show high\nX-ray absorption. We note however that 22 of them (63%)\nare indeed fitted by the Seyfert 1.8 template, which in a\nnumber of cases corresponds to objects with broad emission\nlines (subsection 5.1). It is therefore likely that an intermediate class between unobscured and truly obscured AGN\nexists, made of objects which are dominated by star-light\nemission in the near-IR, and X-ray unabsorbed. In a future\nwork we will extend our analysis to the whole XMDS area;\nthe larger statistics will allow us to refine the photometric classification using a wider set of templates and better\nexplore the relation between X-ray absorption and the optical to mid-IR SED. However, we do not expect all obscured\nAGN that are unabsorbed in the X-rays to be misclassified.\nAnother plausible explanation for (apparent) obscuration without X-ray absorption is a larger relative luminosity\nof the host galaxy compared to the AGN optical light. In\nthis scenario, the AGN optical light might simply be fainter\nthan that of the host galaxy and not extincted.\nOur analysis shows that about 40% of our sources have\nopposite optical and X-ray properties (12 X-ray absorbed,\noptically unobscured AGN and 35 X-ray unabsorbed, optically obscured AGN). The uncertainties related to this\nfraction are linked, on the one side, to the large errors involved in the computation of intrinsic column densities for\nhigh redshift AGN (see subsection 6.2), and on the other\nside, to our classification of sources based on SED fitting\ntemplates. However, these effects cannot fully account for\nthe large number of objects with discrepant optical and Xray properties and the very different trends that we observe\nin Fig. 21. We remind that similar discrepancies are also apparent in the literature, where spectroscopic classifications\nare used (subsection 8.2). These results suggest that the\nbasic formulation of the unified model, in which the viewing angle is the sole factor in determining the AGN type,\nmight be too simplistic. As an example, Elitzur (2006) propose that the difference between type 1 and type 2 AGN is\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS\n\ninstead an issue of probability for direct view of the AGN\nthrough a clumpy, soft - edge torus. Moreover, he suggests\nthat the \"X-ray torus\" does not coincide with the \"dusty\ntorus\" and that the bulk of the X-ray absorption likely\ncomes in most cases from clouds located in the inner, dust\nfree portion of the X-ray torus. The trends with luminosity\ndescribed above agree with this kind of picture, where at\nhigh luminosities dust can be evaporated/expelled, while\nabsorption by gas can be associated with strong outflowing\nwinds outside the dusty torus.\nLarger samples obtained by combining sub-samples\nfrom surveys of various depths and areas, joined with optical spectroscopic data, are necessary to minimize selection\neffects, provide a deeper understanding of the AGN properties and test this scenario.\n\n9. Summary and conclusions\nWe have selected 136 X-ray sources detected at \u2265 3\u03c3 in\nthe 2 \u2212 10 keV band in the XMDS area also covered by the\nVVDS. More than 90% of the sources have been identified\nwith an optical and/or infrared counterpart (Section 3) and\n98% of them have X-ray to optical and X-ray to infrared\nratios typical of AGN (Section 4).\nWe used the optical and infrared data to construct SEDs\nand compute photometric redshifts. The comparison with\nthe spectroscopic redshifts available shows that in 90% of\ncases there is agreement between photometric and spectroscopic estimates (Section 5). All sources fitted by a SFG\ntemplate which have X-ray to optical ratios typical of AGN\n(22 out of 24) have high hard X-ray luminosities (\u2265 1042\nerg s\u22121 ), suggesting that all are indeed AGN with the\nhost galaxy emission dominating in the optical - IR bands.\nObjects fitted by a type 1 AGN template have generally\nblue optical/IR colors and in most cases do not show X-ray\nabsorption, while those fitted by a type 2 AGN or a SFG\ntemplate have red optical/IR colors and most of them are\nX-ray absorbed (Section 5 and 6).\nComparison between photometric and spectroscopic\nclassification, when available, shows that the type 1 AGN\nphotometric classification is unambiguous, but we underestimate the fraction of broad line AGN, since 10 out of\n26 are classified as type 2 AGN due to the dominance of\nstar light emission in the near-IR. AGN fitted by a type 1\ntemplate are referred as optically unobscured, while those\nfitted by a type 2 AGN or a SFG template are referred as\noptically obscured (subsection 5.1).\nWe extracted the X-ray spectra of the 55 X-ray sources\nhaving at least 50 net counts in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band. For\nsources with a smaller number of detected counts, we used\nhardness ratios to compute the column densities. We find\nthat, when the redshift dependence is taken into account,\n60% of the optically obscured AGN are X-ray absorbed, but\n>\nalso 30% of the optically unobscured AGN have Nintr\nH\n1022 cm\u22122 , showing that optical and X-ray classifications\nare not strictly related (Section 6).\nWe constructed stacked X-ray spectra to measure average spectral properties of our sample and to find differences between optically obscured and unobscured AGN as a\nfunction of X-ray flux. We find that stacked spectra of optically unobscured AGN have a photon index consistent with\n\u0393 = 2, similar to average values found for X-ray unabsorbed\nAGN. On the other hand, the slope of stacked spectra of\noptically obscured AGN is consistent with \u0393 \u223c 1.6. The\n\n19\n\nstacked spectrum of the objects fitted by a SFG template\nis even harder, with \u0393 \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.3. (subsection 6.3).\nComparing the fractions of optically obscured and Xray absorbed AGN, we find that while the fraction of optically obscured AGN steeply decreases with redshift and\nluminosity, that of X-ray absorbed AGN is nearly constant\nat \u223c 50% as a function of redshift and X-ray luminosity\n(Section 8). The constancy of the population of X-ray absorbed AGN with redshift and luminosity observed in our\nsample can be explained by the La Franca et al. (2005) predictions that the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGN should\ndecrease with luminosity and increase with redshift, since\nthese two dependences tend to compensate each other in a\nsingle, flux limited sample. The different trends of optically\nobscured and X-ray absorbed AGN are confirmed also by\nthe analysis of spectroscopic samples from the literature,\nshowing that this result is not biased by the uncertainties\nin the photometric classification.\nIn 39% sources (47 out of 122) an inconsistency between\nX-ray absorption and optical obscuration is observed (12\nX-ray absorbed, optically unobscured AGN, and 35 X-ray\nunabsorbed, optically obscured AGN). About 63% of the\noptically obscured X-ray absorbed AGN can be indeed misclassified broad line AGN. On the other hand, the significant fraction of optically unobscured, X-ray absorbed AGN\nfound in our sample suggests that the basic formulation of\nthe AGN unification model can be too simplistic.\nWe also computed the differential logN-logS relationship\nfor the obscured and unobscured AGN, finding that the optically obscured AGN begin to dominate for F < 2 \u00d7 10\u221214\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , where the ratio between obscured and unobscured AGN is \u223c 4.6 (Section 7). In the whole flux range\nconsidered, the surface density of the optically obscured\nAGN is higher than that of the optically unobscured ones\nby a factor of \u223c 2.4. However, if a correction is applied\nto account for misclassified type 1 AGN, the ratio between\noptically obscured and unobscured AGN is \u223c 1.1.\nWe find 22 sources that could be classified as type 2\nQSO candidates (NH > 1022 cm\u22122 , LX > 1044 erg s\u22121 ).\nThey are fitted by a type 2 AGN or a SFG template and\non average their infrared/optical and X-ray/optical flux ratios are typical of extremely obscured AGN. 4 of the 18\nhaving a measured K magnitude are EROs (R \u2212 K > 5 in\nthe Vega system). We estimate a surface density of type 2\nQSOs at F2\u221210 > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 of (35 \u00b1 8) deg\u22122\n(subsection 7.1).\nIn this work the full power of multiwavelength observations is exploited to understand the global properties of\nAGN. We plan to extend our analysis to the whole XMDS\nto improve the statistical significance of our results.\nAcknowledgements. We thank M.

Column 1 list the XMDS\nidentifier, column 2 the XMDS name, columns 3 and 4 the\nX-ray coordinates (astrometrically corrected), column 5 the\n2 \u2212 10 keV flux, column 6 the hardness ratio between the\n2 \u2212 10 and 0.5 \u2212 2 keV bands, column 7 the distance between the X-ray and the optical VVDS position, column 8\nthe VVDS B magnitude, column 9 the VVDS I magnitude,\ncolumn 10 the color classification (B for blue, i.e. B \u2212 I \u2264 1\nand R for red, i.e. B \u2212 I > 1), column 11 the CFHTLS i\u2032\nmagnitude, column 12 the SWIRE 3.6 \u03bcm flux, column 13\nthe SWIRE 24 \u03bcm flux, column 14 the spectroscopic redshift, column 15 the photometric redshift, column 16 the\nphotometric classification based on SEDs (see text) and\ncolumn 17 the absorption corrected 2 \u2212 10 keV luminosity.\nA \"...\" means no data available (i.e. source outside the\nfield of view or not measured flux because of instrumental\nproblems). For sources undetected at 24 \u03bcm, a 5 \u03c3 upper\nlimit (241 \u03bcJy) was used. For sources with ambiguous optical - IR identification, two or more rows are associated\nwith the X-ray source, one for each candidate counterpart,\nwith the one having the best probability (see Section 3)\nlisted as first. In these cases, X-ray data are reported only\nin the first row. All magnitudes are in the AB system. The\nsystematic error on SWIRE fluxes is 5%.\n\n\fTable A.1. The 3 \u03c3 hard sample: XMDS identifier and name, X-ray coordinates, X-ray flux (2 \u2212 10 keV), hardness ratio between the 2 \u2212 10 and 0.5 \u2212 2 keV\nbands, distance between the X-ray and optical VVDS positions, VVDS B and I magnitudes, color classification, CFHTLS i\u2032 magnitude, SWIRE 3.6 and 24 \u03bcm\nfluxes, spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, SED classification (see text) and absorption corrected X-ray luminosity.

In Table B.1 we list the\ncolumn density, photon index, reduced \u03c72 and number of\ndegrees of freedom obtained from analysis of all sources for\nwhich we could leave free both \u0393 and NH , together with\nthe hardness ratio values. In Table B.2 we report spectral\nfit results obtained by fixing the photon index to \u0393 = 2.0\n(columns 2 and 3) and \u0393 = 1.7 (columns 4 and 5), or inserting photometric (or spectroscopic, when available) redshift\nin the model (columns from 6 to 9). In column 10 we report\nthe EPIC cameras used to extract the spectrum.\nFor three sources (XMDS 161, 282 and 1199, see\nTable B.2) the spectral model with \u0393 = 2.0 gives a poor\nfit (\u03c72\u03bd > 2). XMDS 1199 shows a moderate X-ray absorption (NH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 ) and \u0393 frozen to 1.7 gives a better fit\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 1.35). The other two sources have instead very steep\nspectra, in fact the spectral fit obtained with free photon\nindex (see Table B.1) gives \u0393 > 2 for both of them, but,\nwhile for XMDS 282 the fit with \u0393 free is good (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.07),\nwe were not able to find an acceptable fit with a simple\npower law model for XMDS 161, whose spectrum exhibits\na significant soft excess.\nOn the other hand, when \u0393 = 1.7, there are 10 sources\nhaving \u03c72\u03bd > 2: all of them are bright, soft sources, for which\nthe spectral fit with free photon index gives \u0393 > 2.\nFor sources XMDS 124 and 779 no stable solutions were\nfound fixing the photon index to 2.0.\nWhen the redshift was introduced in the spectral model,\nthe photon index was left free when the \u03c72 statistics could\nbe used, otherwise it was fixed to 2.0. In the two cases\ncited above (XMDS 124 and 779) and for XMDS 739 we\nhowever had to fix the photon index to \u0393 = 1.7, because\nfor \u0393 = 2.0 no stable solution was found. For XMDS 453\nno stable solution was found with either value of \u0393.\n\n\fTajer et al.: AGN in the XMDS, Online Material p 6\nXMDS ID\n112\n120\n140\n142\n144\n161\n179\n281\n282\n416\n440\n561\n577\n738\n742\n788\n789\n820\n1199\n1226\n1248\n1252\n\nlogNH (cm\u22122 )\n20.44+0.51\n\u22120.03\n21.08+0.18\n\u22120.28\n20.41+0.39\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.50\n\u22120.00\n20.98+0.30\n\u22120.30\n20.41+0.12\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.40\n\u22120.00\n20.97+0.29\n\u22120.35\n20.41+0.35\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.48\n\u22120.00\n20.68+0.45\n\u22120.26\n20.42+0.57\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.38\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.58\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.38\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.44\n\u22120.00\n20.42+0.54\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.61\n\u22120.00\n21.22+0.23\n\u22120.30\n20.54+0.36\n\u22120.13\n20.41+0.47\n\u22120.00\n20.41+0.21\n\u22120.00\n\n\u0393\n1.65+0.32\n\u22120.16\n1.98+0.22\n\u22120.19\n1.60+0.20\n\u22120.16\n2.28+0.42\n\u22120.24\n2.63+0.56\n\u22120.26\n2.77+0.08\n\u22120.05\n2.34+0.35\n\u22120.25\n2.37+0.25\n\u22120.47\n2.45+0.25\n\u22120.16\n2.03+0.36\n\u22120.23\n2.02+0.50\n\u22120.29\n2.46+0.51\n\u22120.21\n2.35+0.19\n\u22120.13\n2.36+0.28\n\u22120.26\n2.13+0.38\n\u22120.32\n1.81+0.27\n\u22120.20\n2.32+0.49\n\u22120.22\n1.48+0.51\n\u22120.22\n2.13+0.32\n\u22120.32\n1.83+0.21\n\u22120.15\n1.98+0.23\n\u22120.15\n2.20+0.20\n\u22120.19\n\n\u03c72\u03bd (d.o.f.)\n0.90 (19)\n1.02 (32)\n0.84 (10)\n1.15 (10)\n1.00 (12)\n1.40 (74)\n1.30 (11)\n0.69 (12)\n1.07 (19)\n1.24 (13)\n0.34 (10)\n0.74 (13)\n0.60 (25)\n0.43 (8)\n1.26 (7)\n0.62 (11)\n0.58 (11)\n1.21 (8)\n1.06 (9)\n0.80 (22)\n1.01 (20)\n1.24 (15)\n\nHRcb\n-0.60\n-0.61\n-0.72\n-0.74\n-0.60\n-0.81\n-0.65\n-0.72\n-0.72\n-0.60\n-0.58\n-0.76\n-0.74\n-0.69\n-0.66\n-0.56\n-0.74\n-0.52\n-0.58\n-0.62\n-0.67\n-0.66\n\nHRdc\n-0.65\n-0.48\n-0.33\n-0.37\n-0.51\n-0.60\n-0.52\n-0.33\n-0.62\n-0.52\n-0.52\n-0.55\n-0.52\n-0.39\n-0.50\n-0.80\n-0.47\n-0.41\n-0.32\n-0.49\n-0.33\n-0.69\n\nTable B.1.
