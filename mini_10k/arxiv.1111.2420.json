These notions are analogs of the topological chaoses DC2 and its slightly stronger version (which we denote by\nDC121 ). We prove that: 1. If a topological system is measure-theoretically\n(measure-theoretically+ ) chaotic with respect to at least one of its ergodic\nmeasures then it is topologically DC2 (DC112 ) chaotic. 2. Every ergodic\nsystem with positive Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy is measure-theoretically+\nchaotic (even in a bit stronger uniform sense). We provide an example\nshowing that the latter statement cannot be reversed, i.e., of a system of\nentropy zero with uniform measure-theoretic+ chaos.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe notion of chaos was invented by Li and Yorke in their seminal paper [LY]\nin the context of continuous transformations of the interval. Since then several\nrefinements of chaos have been introduced and extensively studied, for instance\nthree versions of so-called distributional chaos (DC1, DC2 and DC3) invented by\nSm\u0131\u0301tal et al ([SS], [SSt], [BSS]). All these notions refer to topological dynamical\nsystems (actions of the iterates of a single continuous transformation T on a\ncompact metric space X) and strongly rely on the observation of distances\nbetween orbits, and the existence of so-called scrambled pairs (or scrambled sets\n\u2013 usually uncountable). There are other notions of chaos, such as Devaney\nchaos or omega chaos, defined without the notion of scrambling \u2013 these are not\naddressed in our paper.\nUnlike in the case of most other notions in dynamics, there have been, to\nour knowledge, no successful attempts to create a measure-theoretic analog of\nchaos \u2013 a notion applicable to measure-preserving transformations of a standard\nprobability space without any specified topology. Although \"measure-theoretic\nResearch of the first author supported from resources for science in years 2009-2012 as\nresearch project (grant MENII N N201 394537, Poland)\nMathematics Subject Classification (2010): 37A35, 37B40\nKeywords and phrases: measure-theoretic chaos, distributional chaos, ergodic system, scrambled set, positive entropy.\n\n1\n\n\fchaos\" appears in the titles of some papers (e.g. [WW]), it still applies to topological systems. There are two major reasons why, at a first glance, it seems\ndifficult to create such an analog:\n\u2022 A standard probability space can be modeled as a compact metric space\nin many different ways. A pair (or set) scrambled in one metric need not\nbe scrambled in another.\n\u2022 A scrambled set in a topological dynamical system very often has measure\nzero for every invariant measure. It is always so for example in case of\ndistributional chaos (in any version) \u2013 we will explain this later. Li\u2013Yorkescrambled sets can have positive measure or even be equal to the entire\nspace, but systems with such large scrambled sets are rather exceptional,\nand any notion of measure-theoretic chaos based on the analogy to these\nsystems would be very restrictive (comp. [WW]). In all other cases, a\nscrambled set can be easily added to the space (or discarded from it) in a\nway negligible from the point of view of measure. In other words, chaos\nbased on the existence of a scrambled set is not stable under measuretheoretic isomorphisms.\nInspired by the methods developed in [D], in this note we propose a way to\novercome these difficulties. We define chaos in measure-theoretic systems using\nexclusively the measurable structure of the space, and so that it becomes an\ninvariant of measure-theoretic isomorphism. Our new notions maintain their\noriginal character \u2013 they are defined in terms of uncountable scrambled sets.\nMoreover, they are related to their topological prototypes and also to positive\nentropy exactly as one would expect (we will give more details in a moment).\nAmong the topological notions of chaos we have chosen one \u2013 the distributional chaos DC2 (with variants) \u2013 as the starting point to define its measuretheoretic analog. This new notion, which we call simply the measure-theoretic\nchaos 1 , meets all our expectations regarding its relations with the topological\nprototype, and it inherits the most important implications between chaos and\nentropy.\nOther notions of chaos are not so well adaptable to the measure-theoretic\ncontext; the attempted analogs of Li\u2013Yorke and DC1 chaoses fail a key property\nallowing to prove that they imply their topological prototypes (see Remark 1\nfor DC1). It is possible to copy our scheme for DC3 (see Remark 3), but\nbecause generally this notion is very weak (it can occur even in distal systems),\nwe have decided to skip it. Nonetheless, for completeness of the survey in the\nnext section, we include the definitions of Li\u2013Yorke, DC1 and DC3 chaoses in\ntopological systems.\nLet us recall that Blanchard, Glasner, Kolyada and Maass have proved that\npositive topological entropy implies Li\u2013Yorke chaos (see [BGKM]). This result\n1 We have decided to suppress the adjective \"distributional\" because \"distribution\" is a\nsynonym of \"measure\". In case of topological chaos, this adjective indicates \"some reference\nto measures\" (maintaining reference to the metric), while here we have reference to a measure\nand nothing else in fact, so the adjective \"measure-theoretic\" should suffice.\n\n2\n\n\fhas been recently strengthened by the first author of this note: positive topological entropy implies distributional chaos DC2 (see [D]). Let us also recall\nthat for interval maps all three versions of distributional chaos (DC1, DC2 and\nDC3) are equivalent to positive topological entropy (see [SS]). We can now be\nmore specific about maintaining these implications by our new notion. We will\nprove that:\n\u2022 A topological dynamical system which is measure-theoretically chaotic\nwith respect to at least one of its invariant measures is DC2 chaotic.\n\u2022 A measure-theoretic system with positive Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy is\nmeasure-theoretically chaotic (in particular, a topological system with\npositive topological entropy is measure-theoretically chaotic for at least\none of its invariant measures \u2013 and thus DC2 chaotic).\n\u2022 For a continuous transformation of the interval, positive topological entropy is equivalent to measure-theoretic chaos for some of its invariant\nmeasures.\nThe last statement is a direct consequence of the preceding two, the variational\nprinciple and the equivalence between DC2 and positive topological entropy for\ninterval maps, thus we do not need prove it separately. We believe that the\nabove assembly of relations (plus the fact that our notion is an isomorphism\ninvariant) is a good enough reason to consider our notion a successful analog of\ndistributional chaos in measure-theoretic dynamics.\n\n2\n\nReview of topological chaos\n\nLet us begin with a review of topological notions of chaos: Li\u2013Yorke, DC1, DC2\nand DC3. Later we will also introduce a notion intermediate between DC1 and\nDC2, which we denote DC121 . All these notions are defined in the same manner:\nthere exists an uncountable scrambled set, where a scrambled set is one whose\nevery pair of distinct elements is scrambled. The only remaining detail is the\nmeaning of a \"scrambled pair\" for the above types of chaos. The definitions\ngiven below are equivalent to the most commonly appearing in the literature\nbut expressed using a slightly different language (this change is meant for an\neasy adaptation to the measure-theoretic situation). We will also define uniform\nversions of DC1 and DC2 (and later \u2013 of DC121 ).\nTraditionally, a pair (x, y) is Li\u2013Yorke-scrambled if\nlim inf d(T n x, T n y) = 0\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand\n\nlim sup d(T n x, T n y) > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThis can be rephrased as follows:\n\u2022 A pair (x, y) is Li\u2013Yorke-scrambled if there exist: an increasing sequence\ni\nni such that d(T ni x, T ni y) \u2212\u2192 0, another increasing sequence mi , and a\npositive number s > 0, such that d(T mi x, T mi y) \u2265 s for all i.\n3\n\n\fDistributional scrambling DC1 and DC2 are similar, except we put density\nconstraints on the sequences ni and mi :\n\u2022 A pair (x, y) is DC1-scrambled if there exist: an increasing sequence\ni\nni of upper density 1, such that d(T ni x, T ni y) \u2212\u2192 0, another increasing sequence mi of upper density 1, and a number s > 0, such that\nd(T mi x, T mi y) \u2265 s for all i.\n\u2022 A pair (x, y) is DC2-scrambled if there exist: an increasing sequence ni\ni\nof upper density 1, such that d(T ni x, T ni y) \u2212\u2192 0, another increasing\nsequence mi of positive upper density, and a number s > 0, such that\nd(T mi x, T mi y) \u2265 s for all i.\nThe resulting chaos DC1 is called uniform if the constant s can be chosen\ncommon for all pairs in the scrambled set. For uniformity of DC2 we will\nrequire that all pairs in the scrambled set have common both the parameter s\nand a positive lower bound \u03b7 for the upper density of the sequences mi .\nScrambling for DC3 has a slightly different structure:\n\u2022 A pair (x, y) is DC3-scrambled if there exists an interval (a, b) such that\nfor every s \u2208 (a, b) the sequence of the times n when d(T n x, T n y) \u2265 s\ndoes not have a density (upper and lower densities differ).2\nRequesting the upper density of mi to be arbitrarily close to 1 we produce\na notion intermediate between DC2 and DC1:\n\u2022 A pair (x, y) is DC121 -scrambled if there exist: an increasing sequence ni of\ni\n\nupper density 1, such that d(T ni x, T ni y) \u2212\u2192 0, and, for every \u03b7 < 1, an\nincreasing sequence m\u03b7,i of upper density at least \u03b7, and a number s\u03b7 > 0,\nsuch that d(T m\u03b7,i x, T m\u03b7,i y) \u2265 s\u03b7 for all i.3\n\nThe meaning of chaos DC121 is clear: there exists an uncountable DC112 -scrambled set. Uniform chaos DC112 occurs when the function \u03b7 7\u2192 s\u03b7 is common for\n2 Traditionally, distributional scrambling is defined using the functions \u03a6\u2217 (t) and \u03a6\nx,y (t)\nx,y\ndefined for t > 0 as, respectively, the upper and lower densities of the set of times n when\nd(T n x, T n y) < t. Clearly, \u03a6\u2217x,y \u2265 \u03a6x,y , both functions increase with t, reaching the value 1\nfor the diameter of X. One can define both functions at zero as the limit values as t \u2192 0+ .\nA pair (x, y) is\n\n\u2013 DC1-scrambled if \u03a6\u2217x,y (0) = 1 and \u03a6x,y (s) = 0 for some s;\n\u2013 DC2-scrambled if \u03a6\u2217x,y (0) = 1, \u03a6x,y (0) < 1;\n\u2013 DC3-scrambled if \u03a6\u2217x,y (s) > \u03a6x,y (s) on an open interval.\n3\n\nIn other words, a pair (x, y) is DC121 -scrambled if \u03a6\u2217x,y (0) = 1, \u03a6x,y (0) = 0.\n\n4\n\n\fall pairs in the scrambled set4 . It is easy to see that\nDC1 =\u21d2 DC121 =\u21d2 DC2 =\u21d2 DC3,\nDC2 =\u21d2 Li\u2013Yorke chaos,\nand that DC1 through DC2 (including the uniform versions) are invariants\nof topological conjugacy (see [SSt]). DC3 does not imply Li\u2013Yorke and, as\nwe mentioned earlier, is not a topological invariant. There are easy examples\nshowing that DC1 is essentially stronger than DC112 , in fact (as we will show\nlater) every system with positive topological entropy is uniformly DC112 , while\nPikula provided an example of a system with positive topological entropy which\nis not DC1 ([P]). It is not very hard to construct an example showing that DC2\n(even uniform) is essentially weaker than DC112 . We refrain from providing such\nan example in this note. A more interesting question is whether DC2 (or uniform\nDC2) persistent under removing null sets (see the formulation of Theorem 5)\nimplies DC121 . At the moment we leave this problem open, with a conjecture\nthat the answer is negative.\nNotice that the condition for a DC2-scrambled pair has a beautiful translation to the language of ergodic averages. A pair (x, y) is DC2-scrambled if and\nonly if\nn\n\n1X\nd(T i x, T i y) = 0\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=1\n\nn\n\nand\n\n1X\nlim sup\nd(T i x, T i y) > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=1\n\nNote how this formulation is analogous to the original condition for Li\u2013Yorke\nscrambling. It is not hard to see that uniformity of DC2 is equivalent to the\nupper limit seen above on the right having a common positive lower bound for\nall pairs in the scrambled set. The fact that DC2 can be phrased in terms of\nergodic averages makes it the best and most natural candidate to become a base\nfor creating a measure-theoretic analog.\n\n3\n\nDefinitions of measure-theoretic chaos\n\nAt this point we leave the topological setup of a compact metric space and\nwe move into the context of a standard probability space (X, B, \u03bc), where B\nis a complete sigma-algebra and \u03bc is a probability measure on B, on which\nwe consider the action of a measure-preserving transformation T . As it was\nsaid before, in order to define measure-theoretic chaos we must overcome two\ndifficulties, the first of which is that the definition of scrambling must not refer\nto any metric. This is done using refining sequences of finite partitions.\n4\n\nIn [D] it is proved that positive topological entropy implies uniform chaos DC2. In this\npaper we will strengthen that result: positive topological entropy implies uniform chaos DC121 .\nThis is why we think uniform DC112 is worth a separate formulation. Similar result is obtained\nin this paper for the measure-theoretic analog.\n\n5\n\n\fDefinition 1. A sequence of finite measurable partitions (Pk )k\u22651 is called refining if Pk+1 < Pk for every k and jointly they generate B (i.e., B is the\nsmallest complete sigma-algebra containing all the partitions Pk ).\nDefinition 2. Fix a refining sequence of finite measurable partitions (Pk ). A\npair of points (x, y) is (Pk )-scrambled if\n\u2022 There exists a sequence ni of upper density 1 such that for every k and\nlarge enough i, T ni x belongs to the same atom of Pk as T ni y.\n\u2022 There exists a sequence mi of positive upper density, and k0 such that, for\nevery i, T mi x and T mi y belong to different atoms of Pk0 .\nThe second major difficulty is to assure that our chaos is an isomorphism\ninvariant. This is achieved by requiring the existence of a scrambled set for\nevery refining sequence of finite partitions, as it is done in the definitions given\nbelow. We will show in the next section that the notions of chaos so constructed\nare indeed isomorphism invariants.\nDefinition 3. A measure-preserving transformation T of a standard probability\nspace (X, B, \u03bc) is measure-theoretically chaotic if for every refining sequence of\nfinite partitions (Pk ) there exists an uncountable (Pk )-scrambled set.\nDefinition 4. The above defined chaos is uniform if (for any refining sequence\n(Pk )) all distinct pairs in the scrambled set are (Pk )-scrambled with a common\nparameter k0 and with a common positive lower bound \u03b7 on the upper density\nof the sequences mi .\nIt is also easy to define a stronger version of measure-theoretic chaos, an\nanalog of DC112 . Precisely this type of chaos is implied by positive entropy,\nhence we find it worth a presentation. It suffices to modify the definition of\nscrambled pairs:\nDefinition 5. A pair (x, y) is (Pk )+ -scrambled if\n\u2022 There exists a sequence ni of upper density 1 such that for every k and\nlarge enough i, T ni x belongs to the same atom of Pk as T ni y.\n\u2022 For every \u03b7 > 0 there exists a sequence m\u03b7,i of upper density at least \u03b7,\nand k\u03b7 such that, for every i, T m\u03b7,i x and T m\u03b7,i y belong to different atoms\nof Pk\u03b7 .\nReplacing (Pk )-scrambling in the definition of the measure-theoretic chaos\nby (Pk )+ -scrambling we obtain measure-theoretic+ chaos. For uniform measuretheoretic+ chaos we require that the function \u03b7 7\u2192 k\u03b7 is common for all pairs in\nthe scrambled set.\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nPresentation of the measure-theoretic chaos\n\nIn this section we formulate and prove our statements concerning the notion of\nmeasure-theoretic chaos, in particular its isomorphism invariance and its relations with the topological counterpart.\nTheorem 1. Suppose the systems (X, B, \u03bc, T ) and (Y, C, \u03bd, S) are isomorphic.\nThen (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is measure-theoretically (uniformly measure-theoretically,\nmeasure-theoretically+ , uniformly measure-theoretically+ ) chaotic if and only\nif so is (Y, C, \u03bd, S).\nProof. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y be the isomorphism. Recall that \u03c0 is a measurable\nbijection between full sets X \u2032 \u2282 X and Y \u2032 \u2282 Y (i.e., sets of full measure in\nthe respective spaces), intertwining the actions of T and S. By a standard\nargument we can arrange that X \u2032 and Y \u2032 are invariant, that is T (X \u2032 ) \u2282 X \u2032 and\nS(Y \u2032 ) \u2282 Y \u2032 . Let (Qk ) be an arbitrarily chosen refining sequence of partitions\nof Y . Denote by Qk\u2032 the restriction of Qk to Y \u2032 and let Pk\u2032 be the partition of\nX \u2032 obtained as the preimage by \u03c0 of Qk\u2032 . Finally let Pk denote the partition of\nX consisting of the elements of Pk\u2032 and the null set C = X \\ X \u2032 . It is obvious\nthat (Pk ) is a refining sequence of partitions in X. If the system on X is\nchaotic (in any of the four considered senses) then there exists an uncountable\n(Pk )-scrambled set E (for the corresponding meaning of scrambling). By (Pk )scrambling and invariance of X \u2032 , for every x \u2208 E there exists nx such that\nT nx x \u2208 X \u2032 . Since E is uncountable, it has an uncountable subset E \u2032 with\na common nx . The set E \u2032\u2032 = T nx (E \u2032 ) is uncountable, (Pk\u2032 )-scrambled and\ncontained in X \u2032 . Now the set \u03c0(E \u2032\u2032 ) is obviously (Qk\u2032 )-scrambled in Y \u2032 which\nimmediately implies that it is (Qk )-scrambled in Y . This ends the proof.\nAlthough our notions of chaos formally apply to all measure-theoretic systems, we will focus on the most important, ergodic, case. Most of the theorems\nstated below require ergodicity anyway. Thus, throughout the remainder of the\npaper we will assume that \u03bc is ergodic.\nIn this context we will provide conditions equivalent to measure-theoretic\nchaos (and its variants) referring to only one refining sequence of partitions and\n\"persistence under removing null sets\":\nTheorem 2. Let (Pk ) be a fixed refining sequence of finite partitions of X. The\nergodic system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is measure-theoretically (measure-theoretically+ , uniformly measure-theoretically, uniformly measure-theoretically+ ) chaotic if and\nonly if for any null set A (i.e., of measure zero) there exists an uncountable (Pk )-scrambled ((Pk )+ -scrambled, uniformly (Pk )-scrambled, uniformly\n(Pk )+ -scrambled) set disjoint from A.\nProof. One implication is trivial, since removing a null set is in fact an isomorphism. We will focus on the nontrivial implication. Suppose that no matter\nwhat null set is removed from X, there remains a (Pk )-scrambled set. Consider another refining sequence of finite partitions (Pk\u2032 \u2032 ). Let A be the null set\nsuch that all remaining points satisfy the assertion of the ergodic theorem with\n7\n\n\fregard to all (countably many) elements of the field (attention, not sigma-field,\njust field) F generated by the partitions (Pk ) and (Pk\u2032 \u2032 ) (that means, the orbit\nof every remaining point visits every set B \u2208 F along a set of times whose density equals \u03bc(B)). By assumption, there exists an uncountable (Pk )-scrambled\nset disjoint from A. We will show that the same set is (Pk\u2032 \u2032 )-scrambled. Take\na pair of distinct points (x, y) from this set and fix some k \u2032 . For an arbitrarily\nsmall \u03b4 > 0 there exists k and a set B of measure at most \u03b4 such that relatively\non X \\B, the partition Pk\u2032 \u2032 is refined by Pk . Clearly, B belongs to F . We know\nthat the sequence of times n when T n x and T n y belong to the same element of\nPk has upper density 1. Removing the sequence of times when at least one of\nthe above two points falls into B we obtain a sequence of times of upper density\nat least 1 \u2212 2\u03b4, when the two points fall in the same element of Pk within X \\ B\n(and hence they fall into the same element of Pk\u2032 \u2032 ). Because \u03b4 was arbitrarily\nsmall, we get that T n x and T n y fall into the same element of Pk\u2032 \u2032 for times n\nwith upper density 1. Further, we know that there exists an index k0 such that\nthe sequence of times n for which T n x and T n y belong to different elements\nof Pk0 has positive upper density, say \u03b7. Fix some \u03b4 > 0 much smaller than\n\u03b7 and find k0\u2032 and a set C \u2208 F of measure at most \u03b4 such that Pk\u2032 \u2032 refines\n0\nPk0 relatively on X \\ C. Removing the sequence of times when at least one\nof the above points falls into C, we obtain a sequence of upper density at least\n\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4 (which is positive) when the two points fall into different elements of Pk0\nwithin X \\ C (hence they are in different atoms of Pk\u2032 \u2032 ). We have proved that\n0\nthe pair (x, y) is (Pk\u2032 \u2032 )-scrambled.\nFor measure-theoretic+ chaos it suffices to note that if \u03b7 is close to 1, so is\n\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4.\nThe same proof applies also to uniform measure-theoretic chaos: if k0 and\n\u03b7 are common to all pairs in the (Pk )-scrambled set, the proof produces common parameters k0\u2032 and \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4 for all pairs in the same set regarded as (Pk\u2032 \u2032 )scrambled.\nThe argument for uniform measure-theoretic+ chaos is the same as for the\nuniform measure-theoretic chaos, applied separately for every \u03b7 (with k\u03b7 and k\u03b7\u2032\nin place of k0 and k0\u2032 , respectively).\nRemark 1. Even if \u03b7 = 1, the proof produces \u03b7 \u22122\u03b4 < 1. This is the reason why\nwe gave up defining an analog of DC1; it could not be tested using one sequence\nof partitions. Similarly, it would probably not imply DC1 in topological systems\n(the proof of Theorem 4 as it is would not pass).\nThe next theorem replaces the \"persistence under removing null sets\" by a\nmuch stronger property: \"ubiquitous presence of chaos\": scrambled sets exist\ninside any set of positive measure:\nTheorem 3. Let (X, B, \u03bc, T ) be an ergodic measure-theoretically (uniformly\nmeasure-theoretically, measure-theoretically+ , uniformly measure-theoretically+ )\nchaotic system. Let (Pk ) be a refining sequence of finite partitions and let B \u2208\nB be a set of positive measure. Then there exists an uncountable (Pk )-scrambled\n\n8\n\n\f((Pk )+ -scrambled, uniformly (Pk )-scrambled, uniformly (Pk )+ -scrambled) set\ncontained in B.\nProof. Throughout the proof \"scrambled set\" stands for either (Pk )-scrambled\nset, (Pk )+ -scrambled set, uniformly (Pk )-scrambled set, or uniformly (Pk )+ scrambled set, depending on the considered version of chaos. Let A \u2282 X be a\nmeasurable set containing no uncountable scrambled sets. We need to show that\n\u03bc(A) = 0. Since the image of a scrambled set is obviously scrambled and has the\nsame cardinality, T \u2212n (A)\nnot contain uncountable scrambled sets either.\nS does \u2212n\nThis implies that A\u2032 = \u221e\nT\n(A) does not contain uncountable scrambled\nn=0\nset (otherwise an uncountable subset of the scrambled set would have to fall in\none item of the union). But A\u2032 is subinvariant (contains its preimage), hence,\nby ergodicity, its measure is either 1 or 0. The first possibility is excluded by\nTheorem 2. It follows that \u03bc(A\u2032 ) = 0, in particular \u03bc(A) = 0.\nLet us devote one page to better understanding the phenomenon of \"ubiquitous presence of chaos\". This phenomenon is the major difference between\nhow topological and measure-theoretic chaoses are constructed (making the latter much stronger). First of all, let us realize that such presence cannot be\nachieved by the existence of a scrambled set of full (or even positive) measure.\nFact is, every (Pk )-scrambled set must be a null set. The same applies to\ndistributionally scrambled sets in topological dynamical systems:\nFact 1. Let (Pk ) be a refining sequence of finite measurable partitions. Assume\nthat \u03bc is nonatomic. Then any (Pk )-scrambled set has measure zero. Similarly,\nany DC3-scrambled (and thus also DC2-scrambled or DC1-scrambled) set in a\ntopological dynamical system is a null set for all nonatomic invariant measures.\nProof. Let (x, y) be a (Pk )-scrambled pair and let k0 be the index in the definition of S\n(Pk )-scrambling. Consider the two-element\npartition of X \u00d7 X into\nS\ntwo sets: A\u2208Pk A \u00d7 A and its complement, A,B\u2208Pk ,A6=B A \u00d7 B. The orbit\n0\n0\nof the pair visits the first set with upper density 1 and the other with positive\nupper density, so the visits in these sets do not have densities. Such pairs are\nexceptional (belong to a null set depending on the index k0 ) for every ergodic\nmeasure on X \u00d7 X. Since there are countably many choices of k0 , the collection\nof all (Pk )-scrambled pairs is a null set for any such measure, and hence also\nfor any T \u00d7 T -invariant measure, in particular, for \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc. So, if E is a (Pk )scrambled set, we have (\u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc)(E \u00d7 E \\ \u2206) = 0. Since \u03bc is nonatomic, also\n(\u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc)(\u2206) = 0, which implies (\u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc)(E \u00d7 E) = 0 and hence \u03bc(E) = 0.\nThe proof for DC3-scrambled sets in topological systems is identical, except\nthat the two-set partition consists of the s-neighborhood of the diagonal and its\ncomplement.\nIt is clear that the \"ubiquitous presence of chaos\" requires the union of all\nscrambled sets to be a set of full measure. Moreover, by a simple transfinite\nargument, there must exist a disjoint family of scrambled sets whose union is a\nfull measure set. But even this last condition seems to be insufficient. Although\n\n9\n\n\fwe do not have an example of a dynamical system, it is easy to imagine an abstract family of disjoint uncountable null sets whose union has full measure, yet,\nthis measure is supported by a set selecting only countably many points (or just\none point) from each member of the family. Then by removing the rest (which\nis a null set) we destroy all the uncountable sets. So, the \"ubiquitous presence\nof chaos\" requires, most likely, an even more sophisticated configuration of the\nscrambled sets (than just the existence of a disjoint collection forming a full\nset). We give up further attempts to find an equivalent condition. What we\nhave just learned for sure is that it is related to abundance of scrambled sets\nrather than their individual largeness.\nNext, we take care of the relations between the notions of measure-theoretic\nchaos and their topological prototypes.\nTheorem 4. Let (X, T ) be a topological dynamical system and let \u03bc be an ergodic T -invariant measure. If the measure-theoretic system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) (where\nB denotes the Borel sigma-algebra completed with respect to \u03bc) is measuretheoretically (uniformly measure-theoretically, measure-theoretically+ , uniformly\nmeasure-theoretically+ ) chaotic then (X, T ) is DC2 (uniformly DC2, DC112 , uniformly DC121 ) chaotic.\nProof. Let (Pk ) be a refining sequence of partitions such that the diameter of\nthe largest atom in Pk decreases to zero with k. For each k we define a sequence\nof open sets Uk,m (m \u2265 1) as follows: by regularity of the measure, each atom\nP of Pk can be approximated (in measure) by a sequence of its closed subsets,\nsay (FP,m )m\u22651 . We let\n[\nFP,m .\nUk,m = X \\\nP \u2208Pk\n\nWe have, for every k, \u03bc(Uk,m ) \u2212\u2192 0. Also let sk,m denote the (positive)\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nminimal distance between points in different sets FP,m , FP \u2032 ,m with P, P \u2032 \u2208 Pk .\nBy Theorem 2, if we remove the null set of points which, for at least one of\nthe sets Uk,m , do not satisfy the assertion of the ergodic theorem, then in the\nremaining part the exists an uncountable (Pk )-scrambled set E. We will show\nthat E is DC2-scrambled. Let (x, y) be an off-diagonal pair in E. For every\n\u01eb > 0 the sequence of times n when d(T n x, T n y) < \u01eb contains the sequence of\ntimes (of upper density 1) when the points T n x, T n y belong to the same atom\nof Pk , where k is so large that the diameter of the largest atom of Pk is smaller\nthan \u01eb. This easily implies that (x, y) satisfies the first requirement for being\nDC2-scrambled.\nFurther, there exists k0 and a positive \u03b7 such that T n x, T n y belong to different atoms of Pk0 for n's with upper density at least \u03b7. Let \u03b4 > 0 be much\nsmaller than \u03b7. Find m so large that the set Uk0 ,m has measure smaller than\n\u03b4. If we now remove from the aforementioned sequence of times n all the times\nwhen at least one of the points T n x, T n y belongs to Uk0 ,m , then we are left\nwith a sequence of upper density at least \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4 (still positive) when the two\nconsidered points are at least sk0 ,m apart. This proves that (x, y) satisfies the\n10\n\n\fsecond requirement for being DC2-scrambled (with the parameters s = sk0 ,m\nand upper density \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4).\nIf E is uniformly (Pk )-scrambled, (Pk )+ -scrambled, or uniformly (Pk )+ scrambled, the same proof yields the corresponding topological scrambling, as\nin the assertion of the theorem.\nThere are many examples of DC2 chaotic systems in which the union of all\nscrambled sets is a null set for all ergodic measures, showing that the implication\nconverse to Theorem 4 need not hold. However, if the topological chaos is\n\"persistent under removing null sets\", it does imply measure-theoretic chaos, as\nstated below.\nTheorem 5. Let (X, T ) be a topological dynamical system and let \u03bc be an ergodic invariant measure. Then the system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is measure-theoretically\n(uniformly measure-theoretically, measure-theoretically+ , uniformly measuretheoretically+ ) chaotic if and only if, after removing any set of measure \u03bc zero,\nthere remains an uncountable DC2-scrambled (uniformly DC2-scrambled, DC121 scrambled, uniformly DC112 -scrambled) set.\nProof. Necessity follows from the proof of the preceding theorem; the DC2scrambled set (or its variants) has been obtained after removing a specific null\nset, but we could have additionally removed any other null set as well. We\npass to proving sufficiency. Choose a sequence (Pk ) with the diameters of\nthe largest atoms decreasing to zero with k, and define the sets Um,k (and the\npositive numbers sk,m ) as in the preceding proof. By Theorem 2, it suffices to\nfix a null set A and find a scrambled set disjoint from A. Let A0 be the null\nset of points which fail the ergodic theorem for at least one of the sets Uk,m .\nBy assumption, there exists an uncountable DC2-scrambled set E disjoint from\nA \u222a A0 . We will show that E is (Pk )-scrambled (and it is obviously disjoint\nfrom A). Take a pair (x, y) of distinct points in E and fix some k. Choose an\narbitrarily small \u03b4 > 0 and let m be such that the measure of Uk,m is smaller\nthan \u03b4. As we know, the sequence of times n when T n x and T n y are closer\ntogether than sk,m has upper density 1. If we disregard the times when at least\none of them falls into Um,k , we are left with a sequence of upper density at least\n1 \u2212 2\u03b4. Note that now, at each of these times, the two points belong to the same\natom of Pk . Because \u03b4 is arbitrarily small, we have shown that T n x and T n y\nbelong to the same atom of Pk for times n of upper density 1.\nWe also know that d(T n x, T n y) is larger than some positive s for times n\nwith positive upper density. It suffices to pick k0 large enough so that every\natom of Pk0 has diameter smaller than s. Then for the same times n, T n x and\nT n y must fall into different atoms of Pk0 . This ends the proof for the usual\n(Pk )-scrambling.\nThe same proof works for the other three variants of chaos.\nRemark 2. Using Theorem 3 the following variant of Theorem 5 can be proved:\nMeasure-theoretic chaos (and its respective variants) for an ergodic measure \u03bc\nin a topological dynamical system is equivalent to \"\u03bc-ubiquitous DC2\" (and its\n11\n\n\frespective variants): an uncountable DC2-scrambled (uniformly DC2-scrambled,\nDC121 -scrambled, uniformly DC112 -scrambled) set exists within every set of positive measure \u03bc.\nRemark 3. Here is an analog of DC3. Call a pair (x, x\u2032 ) (Pk )\u2212 -scrambled if\nthere exists k0 such that the sequence of times n when T n x belongs to the same\natom of Pk0 as T n x\u2032 does not have density (upper and lower densities differ).\nA system is measure-theoretically\u2212 chaotic if, for every refining sequence of\nfinite partitions, there exists an uncountable (Pk )\u2212 -scrambled set. Using slight\nmodifications of the proofs presented in this section one can prove that: 1. This\nnotion is an isomorphism-invariant; 2. It suffices to check \"persistence under\nremoving null sets\" and just one refining sequence of partitions; 3. It enjoys\nthe \"ubiquitous presence\" property; 4. In topological systems it is equivalent\nto DC3 \"persistent under removing null sets\". In particular, as an interesting\nconsequence, we get that DC3 \"persistent under removing null sets of at least\none invariant measure\" is a conjugacy-invariant.\n\n5\n\nMeasure-theoretic chaos versus entropy\n\nThe most important relation between entropy and chaos is contained in the\nfollowing theorem, which, combined with our Theorem 4 (and the Variational\nPrinciple), strengthens several former results ([BGKM], [D]):\nTheorem 6. Every ergodic system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) with positive Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai\nentropy is uniformly measure-theoretically+ chaotic.\nProof. Large part of the proof is identical as in [D]. We now move directly\nto a certain point of that proof (skipping all the arguments that lead to that\npoint). We select a sequence of partitions (Pk ) of X in such a way that (P2k )\nis a refining sequence of partitions (as in the definition of the measure-theoretic\nchaos), while the odd-numbered partitions P2k\u22121 are all equal to one finite\npartition P with positive dynamical entropy h\u03bc (T, P), which we denote by h.\nWe then fix an increasing sequence of integers S = (a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 , a3 , b3 . . . ).\nThe sequence should grow so fast that abkk tends to infinity. We introduce the\nfollowing notation:\n[ak ,bk \u22121]\n\nRk = Pk\n\n:=\n\nb_\nk \u22121\n\nT \u2212i (Pk ),\n\ni=ak\n\nand\nodd\nR1,2k\u22121\n=\n\nk\n_\n\nand\n\nR2i\u22121\n\ni=1\n\nR=\n\n\u221e\n_\n\nR2k\n\nk=1\n\n(note that R is no longer a finite partition, rather a measurable partition which\ncan be identified with the collection of atoms of the sigma-algebra generated by\nthe partitions involved in the countable join). We will also denote by nk the\n\n12\n\n\fdifference bk \u2212 ak . In [D] it is shown that given a decreasing to zero sequence of\npositive numbers \u03b4k and a set X \u2032 of sufficiently large measure 1 \u2212 \u01eb0 then, if the\nsequence S grows fast enough, there exists an atom z of R, a Borel measure \u03bd\nsupported by z \u2229 X \u2032 , a decreasing sequence of measurable sets Vk , such that\nodd\n(A) if B is an atom of R1,2k\u22121\ncontained in Vk then B contains at least\nn2k+1 (h\u2212\u03b4k )\nodd\n2\natoms of R1,2k+1\ncontained in Vk+1 and whose conditional\n\u2212n2k+1 (h\u00b1\u03b4k ) 5\nmeasures \u03bdB range within 2\n.\n\nAs we shall show in a moment, the statement (A) alone suffices to deduce\nuniform measure-theoretic+ chaos. First of all we remark that if we subtract a\nnull set from X \u2032 the statement will still hold (perhaps on a different atom z and\nfor a different sequence S, but this does not matter). Thus, in order to complete\nthe proof of Theorem 6, it remains to show that (A) implies the existence of an\nuncountable uniformly (Pk )+ -scrambled set within the atom z.\nIt is rather easy to see that the statement (A) remains valid if we replace \u03bd\nby the conditional measure \u03bdC , where C is any set of positive measure \u03bd. We\nskip the standard argument here (comp. Fact 1 in [D]). We now represent our\nspace X as a subset of a compact metric space (say, of the unit interval) and\nusing regularity of the measure \u03bd we can remove a set of small measure from the\nodd\nsupport of \u03bd in such a way that all atoms of the partitions R1,2k\u22121\n(for all k)\nintersected with the remaining set C are compact. Replacing \u03bd by \u03bdC , we obtain\nthe condition (A) with the additional feature that the atoms B (and those to\nwhich B splits) are all compact. This will guarantee that the intersection of any\nnested chain of such atoms (with growing parameter k) is nonempty.6\nThe remainder of our proof deviates from that in [D]. The main difference is\nin obtaining separation along a subsequence of upper density \u03b7 close to 1, (not\njust positive). This will be achieved not for the partition P but for P [0,m\u22121]\nwith a suitably selected parameter m.\nAt this point we specify the set X \u2032 . Let \u01ebi (i \u2265 1) be a summable sequence of\npositive numbers with small sum \u01eb0 . Using the Shannon-McMillan Theorem we\ncan find integers mi and a sequence of sets Ci , each being a union of less than\n2mi (h+\u01ebi ) cylinders of length mi , and whose measure exceeds 1 \u2212 \u01eb2i . Further,\nusing the ergodic theorem, we can find n\u2032i so large that the set of points whose\norbits visit Ci more than n(1 \u2212 \u01eb2i ) times within the first n iterates, for every\nn \u2265 n\u2032i , has measure at least 1 \u2212 \u01ebi . For points in a set X \u2032 of measure larger\nthan 1 \u2212 \u01eb0 , this holds for every i.\nFix a number \u03b7 < 1.

The\nmeasure is further restricted to the intersection of z with the set X \u2032 . In this paper, this set\nwill be chosen differently than in [D].\n6 This part of the proof \u2013 ensuring nonempty intersections of nested chains \u2013 was handled\nin [D] differently, by taking closures of the atoms B.

Moreover, we require\nthat 2\u03b4k (\u03b4k is the parameter occurring in the condition (A)) and lognm can be\nadded on the left hand side of (1) maintaining the inequality. We remark that\nthe above requirements hold for all sufficiently large k. For future reference we\nlet k\u03b7 be the smallest choice of k.\nodd\nFix an atom B of R1,2k\u22121\ncontained in Vk . By (A), this atom contains at\nn(h\u2212\u03b4k )\nodd\ncontained in Vk+1 . Every such atom\nleast 2\ndifferent atoms of R1,2k+1\nhas the form B \u2229 A, where A is an atom of R2k+1 . We will call the atoms A\nsuch that B \u2229 A is nonempty and contained in Vk+1 good continuations of B.\nWe denote by A(B) the collection of good continuations of B represented as\nblocks of length n, over the alphabet P. We will now count how many blocks\nA \u2208 A(B) may disagree with one selected block A0 \u2208 A(B) on a smaller than\n\u03b7 fraction of all subblocks of length m.\nTo do it, we draw the block A0 m times, and we subdivide the jth copy\n(j = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1) into subblocks of length m by cutting it at positions equal\nn\nto j mod m (there are at most m\nsubblocks in each copy). This diagram shows\nall subblocks of length m of A0 (plus some incomplete \"prefixes\" and \"suffixes\"\nat the ends; see Figure 1).\nImagine another block A treated the same way and suppose it disagrees with\nA0 on a smaller than \u03b7 fraction of all subblocks. This implies that the fraction\n\u221a\nof all m copies for which A0 and A disagree on a larger than \u03b7 fraction of\n\u221a\nsubblocks visualized in this copy is at most \u03b7. In other words, for a fraction of\n\u221a\n\u221a\nat least 1 \u2212 \u03b7 of all copies, A0 and A agree on at least a fraction of 1 \u2212 \u03b7 of\n\n14\n\n\fthe subblocks. Further, we know that, in this diagram, at most b2k+1 \u01eb2 < 2n\u01eb\nsubblocks represent cylinders not contained in Ci . Again, in at least a fraction\nof 1 \u2212 \u01eb copies the subblocks not contained in Ci constitute a fraction smaller\n\u221a\nthan 2\u01eb. Because \u01eb + \u03b7 < 1, there exists at least one copy where we have both\n\u221a\nsmaller than 2\u01eb fraction of subblocks from outside Ci and larger than 1 \u2212 \u03b7\nfraction of agreeing subblocks. We can now classify all blocks A that we are\ncounting into at most (not necessarily disjoint)\nn\n\nm * 2 m H(\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b7,1\u2212 \u03b7)\n\nn\n\nn\n\n* 2 m H(\u01ebi ,1\u2212\u01ebi ) \u2264 2 m 2H(\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b7,1\u2212 \u03b7)+log m\n\ngroups depending on the choice of the copy, the choice of necessarily agreeing\nsubblocks (perhaps there will be more), and the choice of places reserved for\nvisits in Ci (perhaps not all of them will be used).\nIn every group there are at most\nn\n\n23n\u01eb#P 2 m\n\n\u221a\n\u03b7m(h+\u01eb)\n\n\u2264 2n(\u01eb(3#P+1)+h\n\n\u221a\n\u03b7)\n\nblocks. (We allow any symbols from P on the fraction 2\u01eb of subblocks from\noutside Ci and on the \"prefix\" and \"suffix\" jointly of length not exceeding 2m,\nhence constituting another fraction smaller than \u01eb. Otherwise, on a fraction of\n\u221a\nat most \u03b7 of all subblocks we have free choice from the collection of at most\n2m(h+\u01eb) blocks from Ci ). Multiplying this by the number of groups we get no\nmore than\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2H( \u03b7,1\u2212 \u03b7)\n2n(h\u2212\u03b4k )\n+ lognm +\u01eb(3#P+1)+h \u03b7\nm\n< 2n(h\u22122\u03b4k ) =\n(2)\n2n\n2n\u03b4k\nblocks.\nWe have shown that blocks A differing from a selected block A0 on a smaller\nthan \u03b7 fraction of subblocks of length m form a negligibly small fraction (at\nmost 2\u2212n\u03b4k ) of the family A(B).\nWe are in a position to construct our uncountable uniformly measure-theoretically+ -scrambled set E. We begin by constructing a family B\u03ba , where \u03ba ranges\nover all finite binary words, such that B\u03ba is a (nonempty and closed) atom of\nodd\nR1,2k+1\ncontained in Vk+1 , where k is the length of \u03ba (for k = 0, \u03ba is the empty\nword). We will assure that if \u03b9 extends \u03ba to the right then B\u03b9 \u2282 B\u03ba . We will also\nassure an appropriate separation condition. For that we fix a sequence (\u03b7k )k\u22651\nwith the following properties: the sequence assumes values strictly smaller than\nbut arbitrarily close to 1, each value is assumed infinitely many times, a value \u03b7\nis allowed to occur only for k \u2265 k\u03b7 . The inductive separation condition is that if\n\u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 are binary words of the same length, differing at a position k0 , then, for\nevery k \u2265 k0 (up to the length of \u03ba), the blocks Ak and A\u2032k differ at a fraction\nof at least \u03b7 of all subblocks of length m\u03b7k , where Ak and A\u2032k are the blocks\nappearing at the coordinates [a2i+1 , b2i+1\u22121 ] in the symbolic representation of\nthe atoms B\u03ba and B\u03ba\u2032 , respectively. We will do it by induction on k, in each\nodd\nstep we choose two \"children\" of every so far constructed atom of R1,2k\u22121\n.\nIn step k = 0 we assign B\u2205 to be an arbitrarily selected atom of R1 contained\nin V1 . Suppose the task has been completed for some k \u2212 1, i.e., that we have\n15\n\n\fodd\nselected 2k\u22121 atoms B\u03ba of R1,2k\u22121\n, contained in Vk\u22121 , and pairwise separated\nas required. We order the \u03ba's of length k \u2212 1 lexicographically. Take the first\natom B\u03ba1 (assigned for \u03ba1 = 0 . . . 00). Choose one good continuation A0 of B\u03ba1 .\nFrom every family A(B\u03ba ) (including \u03ba = \u03ba1 ) we eliminate (for future choices)\nall the atoms A which differ from A0 on a smaller than \u03b7k fraction of subblocks\nof length m\u03b7k . Since k \u2265 k\u03b7k , the preceding estimate applies: every family\nA(B\u03ba ) has \"lost\" at most a fraction of 2\u2212n2k+1 \u03b4k of its cardinality. Next we\nchoose A1 from the remaining good continuations of B\u03ba1 and again, from each\nof the families A(B\u03ba ) we eliminate all the atoms A not sufficiently separated\nfrom A1 . Again, the losses are negligibly small. We assign B\u03ba1 0 = B\u03ba1 \u2229 A0\nand B\u03ba1 1 = B\u03ba1 \u2229 A1 (here \u03ba1 0 and \u03ba1 1 denote the two continuations of \u03ba1 ).\nNext we abandon B\u03ba1 and pass to B\u03ba2 (\u03ba2 = 0 . . . 01) and we repeat the procedure choosing two of its good continuations, say A\u20320 , A\u20321 , not eliminated in the\npreceding steps, each time eliminating for future choices all blocks insufficiently\nseparated from the chosen ones. We proceed until we choose two good continuations for every \u03ba of length k \u2212 1. Note that near the end of this procedure we\nwill have eliminated from each family A(B\u03ba ) a fraction of at most 2k * 2\u2212n2k+1 \u03b4k ,\nwhich is less than 1 (we decide about the size of n2k+1 after fixing \u03b4k ). Hence\nthe procedure will be possible till the end. This completes the inductive step k.\nLet now \u03ba denote an infinite binary string, while \u03bak is the prefix of length\nk of \u03ba. The atoms B\u03bak form a decreasing sequence of compact sets, hence have\na nonempty intersection. We select one point from this intersection and call it\nx\u03ba . The set E is defined as the collection {x\u03ba : \u03ba \u2208 {0, 1}N}. The following\nfacts are obvious: the set E is uncountable, all its elements belong to the atom\nz of R. The last fact implies that for each k the orbits of all points from E fall\nin the same element of P2k (which is a partition in our refining sequence) for\nall times n belonging to the intervals [a2k\u2032 , b2k\u2032 \u22121 ] for all k \u2032 \u2265 k. Because the\nratios ab2k\ntend to infinity, it is clear that such times n have upper density 1 and\n2k\nthe first requirement for (P2k )+ -scrambling is verified for all pairs in E.\nConsider a pair of distinct points from E, i.e., x = x\u03ba and x\u2032 = x\u03ba\u2032 , where\n\u03ba 6= \u03ba\u2032 . Let k0 denote the first place where \u03ba differs from \u03ba\u2032 . Fix some \u03b7 < 1\nand then, if necessary, replace it by a larger value, so that \u03b7 occurs as \u03b7k (and\nthen it occurs for infinitely many indices k). Pick such a k larger than k0 and\nobserve the blocks Ak and A\u2032k representing the atoms of R2k+1 containing x and\nx\u2032 , respectively. Since \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 differ at a position smaller than or equal to k,\nthe blocks Ak and A\u2032k have been selected as either two different continuations\nof the same atom of Rodd\n1,2k\u22121 or as continuations of two different atoms of this\npartition. In any case, they have been selected one after another in the inductive\nstep k, which means the latter one (say A\u2032k ) was chosen after eliminating all\nblocks that differ from the former (say Ak ) on a smaller than \u03b7 fraction of all\nsubblocks of length m\u03b7 . This means that Ak and A\u2032k differ on a fraction of at\nleast \u03b7 of such subblocks. Moreover, this is true for infinitely many k's. Because\nbk\nn\nak tends to infinity, this easily implies that the set of times n for which T x\nn \u2032\nm\u03b7\nhas upper density at\nand T x belong to different atoms of the partition P\nleast \u03b7. This is \"almost\" the second requirement for (P2k )+ -scrambling, except\n\n16\n\n\fthat it refers to a wrong partition. In order to replace the partition P m\u03b7 by a\npartition belonging to our refining sequence, i.e., by some P2k\u03b7 we apply the\nsame technique as many times before. There exists k\u03b7 such that P2k\u03b7 refines\nP m\u03b7 except on a set of measure \u03b4 << \u03b7. If, at the start of the proof, we\neliminate points which do not obey the ergodic theorem for the field generated\nby all the partitions of the form P2k and P m , then our points T n x and T n x\u2032\nwill belong to different atoms of P2k\u03b7 for powers n with upper density at least\n\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4 which is as close to 1 as we want. We have shown that the pair x, x\u2032 is\n(P2k )+ -scrambled. Finally we note is that the assignment (\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4) 7\u2192 k\u03b7 arising\nin the proof does not depend on the pair x, x\u2032 and hence the set E is scrambled\nuniformly, which concludes the proof of Theorem 6.\nRemark 4. Let us say that an increasing sequence ni achieves upper density \u03b7\nalong a subsequence N of positive integers if\nlim sup\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n#{i : ni \u2264 N }\n\u2265 \u03b7.\nN\n\nIn the above construction, all upper densities required in the definition of (Pk )+ scrambling (the upper density 1 of the sequence ni and the upper densities \u03b7,\nmore precisely \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b4, of the sequences m\u03b7,i ) are achieved along the subsequence\nbk (the right ends of the intervals [ak , bk \u2212 1]). The only constraints on the\nchoice of the sequence S (containing bk ) concern the speed of its growth, thus bk\ncould have been selected a subsequence of any a priori given infinite sequence of\npositive integers. We will need this observation in the proof of Theorem 7.\nRemark 5. We have obtained a specific scrambled set, which, in spite of being\n\"uniform\" has another property one might call \"synchronic\". Let us say that\nan increasing sequence ni achieves lower density \u03b7 along a subsequence N of\npositive integers if\n#{i : ni \u2264 N }\n\u2265 \u03b7.\nlim inf\nN \u2192\u221e\nN\nClearly, upper density of the sequence ai equals the supremum of all lower densities that the sequence achieves along various subsequences of the positive integers. For all distinct pairs in our scrambled set E the sequences of times ni\nachieve lower densities 1 along the same subsequence, namely along b2k . Further, given \u03b7 < 1, for all distinct pairs in our scrambled set, the sequences m\u03b7,i\nachieve the lower densities \u03b7 along a common sequence, (for instance, if \u03b7 is\nassumed as \u03b7k then the lower density is achieved along b2k+1 , where k denotes\nonly these infinitely many integers for which \u03b7k = \u03b7).\nRemark 6. In the construction, the sequences m\u03b7,i obtained for various values\nof \u03b7 do not achieve their desired lower densities \u03b7 along the same sequence (at\nleast this is not assured). It is so, because with distinct values of \u03b7 we have\nassociated disjoint sequences of indices k such that \u03b7k = \u03b7. It is possible to\nmodify the construction to assure the existence of a common sequence N along\nwhich all the sequences m\u03b7,i (for varying \u03b7 and varying pairs) would achieve\n17\n\n\ftheir desired lower densities \u03b7 (\"synchronic+ scrambling\"). This can be done\nby a different elimination procedure in the construction of the sets B\u03ba . In that\nconstruction we let the sequence (\u03b7k ) increase to 1 (without repeating each value\ninfinitely many times) and, in each inductive step (say k0 ), we assure appropriate separation (on a fraction \u03b7k of all subblocks of length m\u03b7k ) simultaneously\nfor all k \u2264 k0 . We find this extra property not worth a detailed proof.\nCombining Theorem 6, and Remark 2 we obtain the following topological\nstatement, a strengthening of the results from [BGKM] and [D].\nCorollary 1. A topological dynamical system (X, T ) with positive topological entropy reveals \"ubiquitous chaos DC112 \"; an uncountable uniformly DC121 scrambled set exists within every subset of positive measure \u03bc, for every ergodic\nmeasure \u03bc with positive Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy.\nFor a more complete picture of relations between entropy and our notions\nof chaos we give an example showing that Theorem 6 cannot be reversed:\nTheorem 7. There exists a system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) with entropy zero and with\nuniform measure-theoretic+ chaos.\nProof. As a matter of fact, such an example exists in a paper of Serafin [Se].\nMoreover, it is a topological example, with topological entropy zero, in which\nwe will fix an ergodic measure \u03bc. Because the example was created for different\npurposes, we will need to verify the chaos. This is going to be a tedious task.\nLet us first say a few words about certain (invertible) systems (X, T ) that\nhave an odometer factor. Consider a two-row symbolic system, where both\nrows are bi-infinite sequences of symbols. The first row contains symbols from\n{0, 1, 2, . . . , \u221e}, the second row is binary (contains symbols from {0, 1}). The\nelements x \u2208 X obey the following odometer rule with respect to an increasing\nsequence (Nk ) of integers such that, for each k, Nk+1 is a multiple of Nk (this\nsequence is called the base of the odometer):\n\u2022 For each k \u2265 1, the symbols k \u2032 \u2265 k occupy in the first row a periodic set\nof period Nk having exactly one element in every period. Such symbols\nwill be called k-markers. The two-row blocks of length Nk starting with\na k-marker will be called k-blocks. Every point in such a system is, for\nevery k, a concatenation of the k-blocks (see Figure 2).\nIn such a system we introduce a specific sequence of partitions, which we denote\nby (Pk ) defined in the following manner: two points belong to the same atom of\nPk if they have the same and identically positioned central k-block (by which we\nmean the k-block covering the coordinate zero). Notice that there are (at most)\nNk * 2Nk atoms of Pk (Nk counts the possible ways the k-block is positioned\non the horizontal axis, while 2Nk is the maximal number of possible \"words\" in\nthe second row of the k-block).\nLemma 1. The sequence of partitions (Pk ) is refining for any invariant measure \u03bc.\n18\n\n\fFigure 2: An element of a system with an odometer factor to base (Nk ), with\nN1 = 4, N2 = 12, N3 = 48, . . . .\nProof. By general facts concerning standard probability spaces, it suffices to\nshow that after discarding a null set, the partitions Pk separate points. It is\nclear that the partitions separate points x belonging to different fibers of the\nodometer (i.e., differing in the first row). Notice that the symbol \u221e may occur\nin the first row of an x \u2208 X only one time. Thus, by the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence\ntheorem, the set of elements x \u2208 X in which \u221e occurs is a null set for any\ninvariant measure. After discarding this null set, the partitions Pk also separate\npoints belonging to the same fiber of the odometer (the central k-blocks grow\nwith k in both directions eventually covering the entire elements).\nThe partitions Pk have a very specific property (not enjoyed by the \"usual\"\npartitions of symbolic spaces into blocks occurring at fixed positions): if x, x\u2032\nbelong to the same atom of Pk then T i x, T i x\u2032 belong to the same atom of Pk ,\nfor i ranging in an interval of integers of length Nk containing 0 (namely as long\nas shifting by i positions maintains the coordinate zero within the same k-block).\nIn particular, if k \u2032 > k and x, x\u2032 have identically positioned k \u2032 -blocks, say x[a, b]\nand x\u2032 [a, b] are k \u2032 -blocks, then the percentage of times i \u2208 [a, b] when T i x and\nT i x\u2032 belong to the same (different) elements of Pk equals the percentage of\nagreeing (disagreeing) component k-blocks in the k \u2032 -blocks x[a, b] and x\u2032 [a, b].\nWe will refer to this property at the end of the proof.\nNotice that if two points belong to different fibers of the odometer factor then\ntheir orbits are separated by some Pk at all times. Thus every (Pk )-scrambled\nset (if one exists) is contained in one fiber of the odometer. In particular,\nthe uniform measure-theoretic+ chaos is equivalent to the condition that \u03bdalmost every element y of the odometer, where \u03bd is the unique invariant measure\non the odometer, has the property that after discarding any null set for the\ndisintegration measure \u03bcy , the fiber of y contains an uncountable uniformly\n(Pk )+ -scrambled set.\nWe will now reproduce the construction of the example from [Se]. At first,\nwe introduce some notation. If B \u2282 {0, 1}k (i.e., B is a family of selected\nbinary blocks of length k) and q \u2208 N then by B q we mean the family of all\nconcatenations of q elements from B, B q = {B1 B2 . . . Bq : B1 , B2 , . . . , Bq \u2208 B}\n19\n\n\fand by Brep we will mean {BB : B \u2208 B} (the family of all two-repetitions of\nelements of B). Notice that Brep \u2282 B 2 , #B q = (#B)q and #Brep = #B.\nWe fix a sequence of integers (qk )k\u22651 , larger than 1 (for the purposes of\nthis example it suffices to take qk = 2 for all k). The products q1 q2 * * * qk will\nbe denoted by pk . Next we define inductively two families of binary blocks:\nB1 = {0, 1}q1 , C1 = (B1 )rep , and, for k \u2265 2, Bk = (Ck\u22121 )qk , Ck = (Bk )rep . The\nblocks in Bk have length pk 2k\u22121 and those in Ck have length Nk = pk 2k . We\nhave #Bk = #Ck = 2pk .\nNow we can define the system (X, T ) as a two-row symbolic system with the\nodometer G to base (Nk ) encoded in the first row and such that the \"word\" in\nthe second row of every k-block is a block from Ck (see Figure 3.)\n. . .100 000 200 000 100 000 100 000 100 000 100 000 100 000 200 000 100 000 . . .\n. . .101 101 |010{z010} 110\n| {z110} 000\n| {z000} 010\n| 010 110{z110 000 000} 111 111 011 011 . . .\n|\n\n\u2208C1\n\n\u2208C1\n\n\u2208C1\n\nrepetition\n\n{z\n\n}\n\n\u2208C2\n\nFigure 3: An element of our system (here q1 = q2 = 3 hence N1 = 6, N2 = 36).\nThe system so defined has topological entropy zero: the first row system has\ntopological entropy zero because it is an odometer and the second row factor has\nentropy zero by an easy counting argument: the logarithm of the cardinality of\nthe family of k-blocks (equal to pk ) grows much slower than their length (equal\nto pk 2k ). (The entire system has entropy zero, as a topological joining of two\nsystems with entropy zero.)\nIn order to define an invariant measure \u03bc it suffices to declare all atoms of the\npartition Pk (corresponding to the k-blocks positioned around coordinate zero)\n1\nto have equal measures. (The measure of an atom then equals #P\n= Nk12pk .)\nk\nWe skip the standard proof that this indeed determines a shift-invariant measure\nwhich is ergodic.\nLet H be the odometer to base (pk ) represented similarly as G, in form of a\nsymbolic system over the alphabet {0, 1, . . . , \u221e}. Notice that since, for each k,\nNk is a multiple of pk , H is a topological factor of G; the factor map (which we\ndenote by \u03c6) consists in inserting more k-markers (we skip the obvious details).\nThe unique invariant measure \u03bd supported by G is sent to the unique invariant\nmeasure \u03be supported by H.\nFor \u03bd-almost every y \u2208 G we will now describe a measurable bijection \u03c0y\nbetween the fiber of y in our system X and the fiber of \u03c6(y) in the direct product\n(H\u00d7{0, 1}Z), sending the measure \u03bcy to the Bernoulli measure \u03bb = { 12 , 12 }Z . The\nrigorous definition of the map and the proof of the correspondence of measures,\nalthough completely elementary, are lengthy and not very interesting. Instead\nwe provide a slightly informal description.\nSuppose we want to create a k-block appearing in the system X. Since the\nfirst row is determined (up to the value of the \"leading marker\" which can be\n20\n\n\fany number k \u2032 \u2265 k) we only need to write a block belonging to Ck . Suppose\nwe write it from left to right. While doing this, we encounter two kinds of\npositions: those which can be filled completely arbitrarily, independently of\nwhat was filled earlier (we call them the \"free positions\"), and other, where we\nhave \"forced repetitions\" of something that was filled earlier. There are exactly\npk free positions and each of them is repeated 2k \u2212 1 times (jointly determining\n2k positions, see Figure 4).\n\n3000 1000 1000 1000 2000 1000 1000 1000 2000 1000 1000 1000 2000 1000 1000 1000\n0101 1111 0101 1111 0000 1010 0000 1010 0101 1111 0101 1111 0000 1010 0000 1010\nFigure 4: An example of a 3-block (for q1 = q2 = q3 = 2). The \"free positions\"\nare underlined and the positions determined by the free position 18 are overlined.\nGiven a k-block B appearing in X, the free positions read from left to right\nconstitute a new two-row block of length pk , with markers positioned as in a\nk-block over the odometer H. We have just described a bijection (denoted \u03c0k )\nbetween all k-blocks of X and all k-blocks appearing in (H \u00d7 {0, 1}Z).\nWe need to take a closer look at the map \u03c0k . Every (k + 1)-block C is a\nconcatenation of 2qk k-blocks (half of which is repeated):\nC = B (1) B (2) . . . B (qk ) B (1) B (2) . . . B (qk ) .\nThe reader will easily verify that then\n\u03c0k+1 (C) = \u03c0k (B (1) )\u03c0k (B (2) ) . . . \u03c0k (B (qk ) ).\nFix some y \u2208 G and let x belong to the fiber of y (i.e., x has y in the first row).\nFor each k, let Bk (x) denote the central k-block in x. Find the coordinate zero in\nthe block Bk+1 (x). Since Bk+1 (x) = B (1) B (2) . . . B (qk ) B (1) B (2) . . . B (qk ) , there\nexists an index i such that the coordinate zero falls within (one of two copies) of\nthe k-block B (i) (that is to say, Bk (x) = B (i) ). In such case we place the image\nblock \u03c0k+1 (Bk+1 (x)) (which equals \u03c0k (B (1) )\u03c0k (B (2) ) . . . \u03c0k (B (qk ) )) along the\nhorizontal axis in such a way that the zero coordinate falls within the subblock\n\u03c0k (B (i) ). The precise location of the coordinate zero within the latter block is\nestablished analogously, by repeating the same procedure for k, k \u2212 1, k \u2212 2, etc.\nIn this manner we obtain a consistent family of positioned blocks \u03c0k (Bk (x))\ngrowing either in one or in both directions around the coordinate zero (and\nthis behavior depends only on the first row y of x). By an easy argument, \u03bdalmost surely, the blocks \u03c0k (Bk (x)) grow around the coordinate zero in both\ndirections, eventually determining a two-sided sequence, which we denote by\n\u03c0y (x). This completes the definition of the map \u03c0y . We skip the verification\nof the fairly obvious fact that for y's for which the map \u03c0y is defined, \u03c0y is a\nbijection between the fiber of y and {\u03c6(y)} \u00d7 {0, 1}Z, sending \u03bcy to \u03bb.\n21\n\n\fFor y's for which the map \u03c0y is well defined, the partition Pk (determined\nby the position and contents of the central k-block) restricted to the fiber of\ny maps by \u03c0y to an analogous partition of H \u00d7 {0, 1}Z (which we denote by\nQk ), restricted to {\u03c6(y)} \u00d7 {0, 1}Z. Since the product system H \u00d7 {0, 1}Z with\nthe product measure \u03be \u00d7 \u03bb has obviously positive entropy, by Theorem 6, it is\nuniformly measure-theoretically+ chaotic. As we have already mentioned, this\nmeans that \u03be-almost every z \u2208 H (we let H \u2032 be the corresponding set of full\nmeasure) has the property that after removing any \u03bb-null set, {z} \u00d7 {0, 1}Z\ncontains an uncountable uniformly (Qk )+ -scrambled set. We would like to\ndeduce that this property passes to X. We will use the map \u03c6 between the\nodometers and the maps \u03c0y on the fibers. For instance we immediately define\nG\u2032 = \u03c6\u22121 (H \u2032 ) and we note that G\u2032 is a set of full measure \u03bd. The difficulty\nis that the combined map (from X to H \u00d7 {0, 1}Z) is not shift-equivariant\n(it cannot be, because a system with positive entropy cannot be a factor of a\nsystem with entropy zero), hence the \"percentage of agreement/disagreement\"\nalong two orbits is not automatically preserved. We must check it \"manually\".\nNotice that, since every free position in a k-block of X has the same number\nof \"forced repetitions\", the percentage of entries where two such k-blocks differ\n(equal) is the same as the percentage of entries where their images by \u03c0k differ\n(equal). Moreover, this \"preservation of percentage\" passes to higher blocks:\nPick some k \u2032 > k. Every k \u2032 -block C is a concatenation of k-blocks; some of them\nare \"free\", and some are \"forced repetitions\". Each of the \"free\" component kblocks has the same number of \"forced repetitions\". The reader will easily\nobserve that the image \u03c0k\u2032 (C) equals the concatenation of the images by \u03c0k of\nthe \"free\" component k-blocks. Thus, for two k \u2032 -blocks, say C, D, the percentage\nof the component k-blocks which are the same (different) in C and D is the same\nas the percentage of the component images of the k-blocks which are the same\n(different) in \u03c0k\u2032 (C) and \u03c0k\u2032 (D).\nBy an easy argument involving the Borel-Cantelli Lemma, \u03bd-almost every\ny has the following property: there exists a subsequence kl (depending on y)\nsuch that the relative position of the zero coordinate within the central kl -block\ndivided by its length Nkl converges with l to zero. Similarly, for \u03bd-almost every\ny, the same holds (and we can assume, along the same sequence kl ) for the\nimages \u03c0y (x).\nWe now fix some y \u2208 G\u2032 for which the map \u03c0y is defined and which fulfills\nthe above two \"almost sure\" conditions. Let A be a \u03bcy -null set and let A\u2032 =\n\u03c0y (A) (which is a null set for the Bernoulli measure). We already know that\n{\u03c6(y)} \u00d7 ({0, 1}Z \\ A\u2032 ) contains an uncountable uniformly (Qk )+ -scrambled set\n\u2032\n\u2032\nEA\n. Moreover, by Remark 4 we can arrange such a scrambled set EA\nthat all\nthe upper densities required in the definition of scrambling are achieved along\nthe subsequence pkl .\n\u2032\nLet EA be the preimage by \u03c0y of EA\n. Clearly, EA is uncountable and disjoint\nfrom A. It remains to show is that EA is uniformly (Pk )+ -scrambled. This,\nhowever, is an almost immediate consequence of the following facts (we leave\nthe easy deduction to the reader):\n\n22\n\n\f\u2032\n\u2022 the upper densities required for scrambling of EA\nare all achieved along\nthe subsequence pkl ,\n\n\u2022 for large l the central kl -blocks in x, x\u2032 (in the fiber of our selected y)\nstart \"nearly\" at the coordinate zero, which implies that the percentage\nof times i \u2208 [0, Nkl \u2212 1] when T i x and T i x\u2032 belong to the same (different)\natoms of Pk is nearly the same as for i \u2208 [a, b], where a, b are the ends\n(common for both points) of the central kl -block. An analogous statement\nholds for \u03c0y (x) and \u03c0y (x\u2032 ) and the times i \u2208 [0, pkl \u2212 1] (of course, the\nends a, b of the central kl -blocks are now different);\n\u2022 due to the specific property of the partitions Pk , the percentage of times\ni \u2208 [a, b], when T i x and T i x\u2032 belong to the same (different) atoms of\nPk equals the percentage of agreeing (disagreeing) k-blocks in the central\nkl -blocks of these points. An analogous statement holds for the points\n\u03c0y (x), \u03c0y (x\u2032 ) and the partitions Qk ;\n\u2022 for k \u2032 > k the percentage of agreeing (disagreeing) k-blocks within the\ncentral kl -blocks of x, x\u2032 equals the percentage of agreeing (disagreeing)\nk-blocks within the central kl -block of \u03c0y (x), \u03c0y (x\u2032 ).\n\n6\n\nOpen problems\n\nQuestion 1. As we have already mentioned, we do not know whether DC2 (or\nuniform DC2) persistent under removing null sets implies DC112 . Similarly, we\nhave no examples showing that measure-theoretic+ chaos is essentially stronger\nthan the measure-theoretic chaos.\nAs the results of [DL1] and [DL2] show, some properties necessary for positive topological entropy (such as the existence of asymptotic or forward mean\nproximal pairs7 ), if inherited by all topological extensions of the system, become\nalso sufficient. Thus it seems reasonable to ask the following\nQuestion 2. Is it true that a topological dynamical system whose every topological extension is DC2 (DC121 ) chaotic has positive topological entropy? Is it true\nthat every ergodic system whose every (measure-theoretic) extension is measuretheoretically (measure-theoretically+) chaotic has positive Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai\nentropy?\nWe were unable not only to resolve the above, but even to disprove the following: it might happen that unlike topological chaoses, the measure-theoretic\n7 A pair x, x\u2032 is forward mean proximal if there exists a sequence n of density 1 along which\ni\nd(T ni x, T ni x\u2032 ) \u2192 0 (in other words \u03a6x,y (0) = 1). This terminology goes back to Ornstein\nand Weiss [OW] (or even to an earlier work of Furstenberg). It is regretful that such pairs\nare not called \"mean asymptotic\". \"Mean proximal\" fits much better to pairs for which the\nsequence ni has upper density 1 (i.e., with \u03a6\u2217x,y (0) = 1), which is the first condition in DC1\nand DC2 scrambling. With the present terminology, we have no good name for such pairs.\n\n23\n\n\fchaos passes to extensions. So we have another question, in a sense opposite to\nthe preceding one:\nQuestion 3. Suppose (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is a (measure-theoretic) factor of (Y, C, \u03bd, S)\nand that the former system reveals measure-theoretical chaos (in one of the\nfour discussed versions). Does that imply the same chaos for the latter system?\nSimilarly, if (X, T ) is a topological factor of (Y, S) and (X, T ) reveals DC2\npersistent under removing null sets. Does that imply DC2 for (Y, S)?\n\nReferences\n[BSS]\n\nF. Balibrea, J.
