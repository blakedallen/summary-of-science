No optical emission from the pulsar has been detected down to a\nlimiting flux of V \u223c 27.8.\n\nIntroduction\nThe about 1500 radio pulsars known to date are interpreted as rapidly spinning and strongly magnetized\nneutron stars which are radiating at the expense of their rotational energy. Millisecond pulsars form a\nseparate group among the rotation-powered pulsars. They are distinguished by their small spin periods\n(\u2264 20 ms) and their high spin stability (\u1e56 \u2248 10\u221218 \u2212 10\u221221 s s\u22121 ), with corresponding spin-down ages\nP/2\u1e56 of typically 109 \u2212 1010 years. Only \u2248 20% of the galactic millisecond pulsars are solitary, including\nPSR B1257+12 which is in a planetary system. The rest are in binaries, usually with a low-mass white\ndwarf companion. Optical observations of binary millisecond pulsars have so far only allowed to detect the\ncompanion star (see, e.g., Danziger et al. 1995; Lundgreen et al. 1996) and to constrain the global evolution\nof the binary systems. In no case it was possible to detect the fainter optical emission from the neutron star\nwhich is buried by the brighter companion. Optical observations of solitary millisecond pulsars thus are the\nonly chance to explore the optical emission properties of these peculiar objects.\nThe optical emission of solitary millisecond pulsars can be ascribed either to magnetospheric or thermal\nradiation from the neutron star surface. However, unless some reheating mechanism is at work, optical\nthermal radiation is expected to be virtually undetectable for old (\u2248 109 yrs), cooled off, neutron stars and\nmagnetospheric radiation appears the most likely emission process. From the model developed by Pacini\n(1971), the magnetospheric emission is expected to depend on the pulsar's spin parameters according to the\nrelation Lopt \u221d B 4 P \u221210 . Although valid for young pulsars such a dependance, as well as any breakdown\nwith the pulsar's age, is still unclear for older neutron stars. Detecting optical emission from millisecond\npulsars, i.e. short period and low \u1e56 objects, would thus be of paramount importance to define a general\nframework.\nAs for classical, i.e., isolated non-millisecond pulsars, a detection at soft X-ray energies represents an important indicator that the object is likely detectable at optical wavelength. Currently, soft X-ray emission\nhave been discovered from a number of galactic solitary millisecond pulsars but only for a few of them X-ray\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1. Comparison between the X-ray and radio pulse profiles of PSR J2124\u22123358. The gross similarities in the\npulse structure is obvious and indicates that the emission process which powers the X-ray pulsations is closely\nrelated to the radio emission ones. This clearly suggests a magnetospheric origin also for the X-ray emission.\npulses have been detected (see Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999; Becker & Aschenbach 2002).\nPSR J2124\u22123358\nOne of the most interesting objects is PSR J2124\u22123358. The pulsar was identified in radio during the\nParkes 436 MHz southern survey (Bailes et al. 1997). Its measured \u1e56 of 1.096 10\u221220 s s\u22121 gives an age of 7.2\nbillion years, a magnetic field of 2.3 108 G and a rotational energy loss of 3.5 1033 ergs s\u22121 . PSR J2124\u22123358\nwas discovered in soft X-ray energies during a recent study of galactic isolated millisecond pulsars using the\nROSAT HRI (Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999). Its X-ray emission was found to be pulsed at the radio period, with\na sharp double-peaked pulse profile. The shape of the X-ray pulse profile was considered a strong evidence\nthat the X-ray emission from this millisecond pulsar is dominated by non-thermal emission (cf. Becker &\nTr\u00fcmper 1999). Indeed, the X-ray lightcurve exhibits a double peak structure remarkably similar to the\npulse profile observed in the radio domain at 436 MHz (Bailes et al. 1997; Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999). Figure\n1 shows a comparison between the PSR J2124\u22123358 pulse profiles as oberved in the X-ray and radio bands.\nThe interpretation in terms of magnetospheric emission has been later supported by ASCA observations\nwhich showed that the pulsar spectrum in the 0.5-10 keV interval is compatible with a power law (Sakurai\net al. 2001).\nPSR J2124\u22123358 is therefore one of the most promising millisecond pulsars for optical studies as it turns out\nto be one of the brightest solitary millisecond pulsars detected at X-ray energies. Its close distance of about\n270 pc (Cordes & Lazio 2002) together with its small Hydrogen column absorption of \u223c 2 \u2212 5 1020 cm\u22122\n(Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999) also make this object a natural target for subsequent optical observations.\nObservations\nThe first optical observations of the PSR J2124\u22123358 field were performed in July 1998, shortly after the\ndetection of the pulsar in X-rays. Observations were performed with the ESO NTT using the ESO Multi\nMode Instrument (EMMI) in its Blue Arm configuration with a pixel size of 0.37\" (field of view 6.2\u2032 \u00d7 6.2\u2032 ).\nA total of six exposures (1200s each) were acquired through a B filter. Single images were reduced us-\n\n\f3\ning standard MIDAS recipes and combined using a median filter algorithm. Photometric calibration was\ncomputed through short exposures of Landolt's fields. Unfortunately, since all the exposures of the PSR\nJ2124\u22123358 field were affected by bad atmospheric conditions and by a seeing constantly above 1.5\" it was\nnot possible to reach a detection limit fainter than B \u2243 25 (Becker & Mignani, unpublished).\nThe field of PSR J2124\u22123358 was observed again between August and September 2001 using the ESO\nVLT/Antu telescope operated in Service Mode from the Paranal Observatory (Becker et al. 2002). Imaging\nwas performed using the FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph 1 (FORS1) camera operated in its standard\nresolution mode, with a pixel size of 0.2\" and a corresponding field of view of 6.8\u2032 \u00d7 6.8\u2032 . Images were taken\nthrough the U (\u03bb = 3660\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb = 360\u00c5), B (\u03bb = 4290\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb = 880\u00c5) and V (\u03bb = 5540\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb = 1110.5\u00c5)\npassbands to allow for a significant spectral coverage. For each filter, sequences of 12 repeated exposures\nwere obtained for a total integration time of 9360 s in U and 6000 s in B and V . The detailed summary of\nthe observations is listed in Table 1. To allow for relative adjustments in the flux calibration, one exposure\nof each sequence was obtained under photometric conditions. The pulsar field was always observed close to\nthe minimum airmass with average values of 1.10 (U ), 1.09 (B) and 1.03 (V ). Seeing conditions across all\nthe exposures varied between \u223c 0.6\" and \u223c 1.0\".\nStandard reduction steps were applied through the FORS1 image reduction pipeline. For each night, master\nbias and sky flats were used for debiassing and flatfielding. Flux calibration was computed using the extinction and color-corrected photometric zero-points routinely computed for each night. For each passband,\nsequences of repeated exposures were finally co-added by applying a median filter algorithm to reject cosmic\nray hits.\nDate\n2001 August 12\n2001 August 13\n\n2001 Sep 14\n2001 Sep 17\n2001 Sep 18\n\nFilter\nU\nU\nB\nV\nB\nV\nB\nV\n\nNo. of exp.\n3\n9\n1\n1\n6\n6\n5\n5\n\nExposure(s)\n780\n780\n500\n500\n500\n500\n500\n500\n\nseeing (\")\n1.0\"\n0.8\"\n0.8\"\n0.8\"\n0.58\"\n0.63\"\n0.52\"\n0.96\"\n\nairmass\n1.33\n1.026\n1.034\n1.028\n1.134\n1.046\n1.054\n1.017\n\nTable 1.

For each\nobservation, the columns give the observing date, the filter, the number of exposures, the integration time per\nexposure, the average seeing conditions, and the average airmass during the exposure sequence.\n\nResults\nSince the first hint to claim the optical identification of the pulsar comes from a positional coincidence\nwith a potential counterpart, an accurate astrometry of the field is a key issue. In order to register the very\naccurate (down to few milliarcseconds) pulsar position (Gaensler, Jones and Stappers 2002) on the FORS1\nimages, we have recomputed the FORS1 astrometry using as a reference the positions of stars selected from\nthe Guide Star Catalogue II, which have an intrinsic absolute astrometric accuracy of \u2248 0.35\u2032\u2032 per coordinate.\nAfter identifying a number of well suited GSC-II objects in the co-added V -band image, the pixel-to-sky\ncoordinate transformation has been computed using the program ASTROM1 . The final precision on the\nastrometric fit was \u223c 0.09\u2032\u2032 in both RA and Dec. To this value we then added an error of 0.17\u2032\u2032 due to the\npropagation of the intrinsic absolute errors on the GSC-II coordinates.\n1\n\nhttp://star-www.rl.ac.uk/Software/software.htm\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2. From top left to bottom left: U , B and V -band images of the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR\nJ2124\u22123358 obtained with the FORS1 instrument of the VLT-Antu. North to the top, East to the left. The\nimages, 25\" \u00d7 25\", are obtained by the median of all the available exposures (see Table 1). The cross marks\nthe nominal radio position of the pulsar computed according to the more recent radio coordinates (see Gaensler,\nJones and Stappers 2002). The sizes of the cross arms is set to 1 arcsec, i.e., 5 times the overall uncertainty on\nthe pulsar position\n\n\f5\nSince the error on the pulsar position is negligible, the overall uncertainty in the registration of the radio\ncoordinates on the optical frames is dominated by the accuracy of the astrometric catalogue used as a\nreference and by the rms of the astrometric fit. Taking both factors into account, we finally ended up with\nan uncertainty of \u2248 0.2\u2032\u2032 in both RA and Dec. Any additional uncertainty on the pulsar position due to\nits known proper motion of \u03bc = 52.6 mas yr\u22121 (Cordes, Jones and Stappers 2002) is certainly within our\nglobal error budget. We note that the GSC-II astrometry was tied to the extragalactic radio source frame\n(ICRF), thus our position should not be significantly affected by any systematic offset between the radio\nand optical reference systems. Our astrometry is shown on the co-added U BV -band images (Figure 2). No\nobject is detected at the pulsar position down to 3\u03c3 limiting magnitudes of U \u2243 26, B \u2243 27.7 and V \u2243 27.8.\nThus, we assume these values as upper limits on the optical flux of the pulsar. By scaling for the assumed\ndistance of 270 pc (Cordes & Lazio 2002), our upper limits imply an optical luminosity Lopt \u2264 2.5 1026 ergs\ns\u22121 , which makes PSR J2124\u22123358 intrinsically fainter than the old (\u2248 106 \u2212 107 yrs) ordinary pulsars PSR\nB1929+10 and PSR B0950+08 (Pavlov et al. 1996).\nConclusions\nWe have reported on the first, deep, optical observations of the field of the millisecond pulsars PSR\nJ2124\u22123358 performed with the ESO VLT. The pulsar is undetected down to a flux limit of V \u223c 27.8, the\ndeepest obtained so far for an object of this class. Unfortunately, this result adds to the list of non-detections\nof millisecond pulsars deriving from (shallower) observations recently performed with the VLT, namely PSR\nJ1024\u22120719, PSR J1744\u22121134 (Sutaria et al. 2002) and PSR J0030+0451 (Koptsevich et al. 2002). Future\nobservations of these objects in the near-UV with the HST will probably offer higher chanches of detection.\nREFERENCES\nBailes, M., Johnston, S., Bell, J.F., et al., Discovery of Four Isolated Millisecond Pulsars, ApJ 481, 386,\n1997\nBecker, W. & Tr\u00fcmper, J., The X-ray emission properties of millisecond pulsars, A&A 341, 803, 1999\nBecker, W., Mignani, R.P., Lommen, A. and Backer, D., XMM and VLT observations of the millisecond\npulsar PSR J2124\u22123358, to be submitted to ApJ, 2002\nKoptsevich, A.B., Lundqvist, P., Serafimovich, N.I., Shibanov, Y.A., Sollerman, J., Deep BVR Imaging of\nthe Field of the Millisecond Pulsar PSR J0030+0451 with the VLT, A&A-accepted (astro-ph/0212501),\n2002\nBecker, W. & Aschenbach, B.,X-ray Observations of Neutron Stars and Pulsars: First Results from XMMNewton, Proc. of the 270th WE-Heraeus Seminar on Neutron Stars, Pulsars, and Supernova Remnants.\neds.
