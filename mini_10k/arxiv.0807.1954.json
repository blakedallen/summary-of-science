These results suggest that a cortical neuron has an\nadaptation mechanism and that the dynamical threshold has some significance\nfor the computational properties of a neuron.\n\n\fInfluence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nNeurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs, which are then transformed into output\nspike trains. A common assumption in neuroscience is that the firing rate\u2212the average\nnumber of spikes per unit time\u2212of a neuron conveys information and is used for\ncomputation in the brain. This assumption is supported by a number of experimental\nstudies [1, 2, 16]. It is therefore very important to study the relationship between the\ninput current and the firing rate (f-I curve) in the presence of background synaptic\ninputs in order to understand the computation performed by a neuron.\nRecently, the leaky integrate-and-fire with dynamical threshold (LIFDT) model [5,\n6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15] has been proposed so as to include spike frequency adaptation.\nAlthough the LIFDT model is simple, it can reproduce important properties of cortical\nneurons such as the negative interspike interval correlation [5, 15] and the f-I curve\nof pyramidal neurons driven by a fluctuating current [13]. It is also reported that\nthe spike threshold of a cortical neuron in vivo is not constant but depends on the\npreceding spike times [10].\nOur understanding of the effect of the dynamical threshold on the computational\nproperties of a neuron is lacking. We studied whether the leaky integrate-and-fire\n(LIF) and LIFDT neuron can reproduce the f-I curve of a cortical neuron [7] and\nhow the dynamical threshold modulates the f-I curve in the presence of background\nsynaptic inputs.\n2. Method\n2.1. Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron\nHere, we briefly introduce the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron [12]. The\nmembrane potential V of the neuron obeys the first-order differential equation\ndV\nC\n= \u2212gL (V \u2212 V\u221e ) + I(t),\n(1)\ndt\nwhere C is the membrane capacitance, gL is the leak conductance, V\u221e is the resting\npotential of the neuron, and I(t) is the input current. When the membrane potential\nreaches the threshold \u03b80 , a spike is generated and we instantaneously reset V (t) to the\nresetting potential Vr . We adopted the parameters of the LIF neuron from Chance et\nal. [7], where C = 0.5[\u03bcF/cm2 ], gL = 0.025[\u03bcS/cm2 ], V\u221e = \u221265[mV], Vr = \u221260[mV],\nand \u03b80 = \u221254[mV].\n2.2. Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with dynamical threshold\nWe briefly introduce here the LIFDT neuron [5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15]. The membrane\npotential V of the neuron obeys Eq. (1). In the following, we take the parameters\nC, gL , V\u221e , Vr to be the same as in the LIF neuron. When the membrane potential\nreaches the threshold \u03b8(t), a spike is generated and we instantaneously reset V (t) to\nthe resetting potential Vr . The emission of a spike causes the threshold to increase by\nan amount A\u03b8 and then decay to its resting value \u03b8\u221e exponentially:\nX\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u221e\nd\u03b8\n+ A\u03b8\n=\u2212\n\u03b4(t \u2212 tk ),\n(2)\ndt\n\u03c4\u03b8\nk\n\nwhere \u03c4\u03b8 is the time constant of the dynamical threshold and tk is the k-th spike\ntime. The sum is taken over all the spikes generated by the neuron up to time t.\n\n\fInfluence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation\n\n3\n\nThe initial condition of the threshold is its resting value: \u03b8(0) = \u03b8\u221e . The parameters\nof the dynamical threshold are \u03b8\u221e = \u221254[mV], adopted from Chance et al. [7]., and\n\u03c4\u03b8 = 80[ms], adopted from Liu and Wang [15].\n2.3. Synaptic input\nWe considered an input current I(t) = m + Is (t), which is the sum of a constant\ncurrent m and a background synaptic current Is . The synaptic current is described\nby\nIs (t) = gE (t)(VE \u2212 V (t)) + gI (t)(VI \u2212 V (t)),\n!\nX\nt \u2212 tE,I\nk\ngE,I (t) =\naE,I exp \u2212\n,\n\u03c4E,I\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nwhere gE,I are the excitatory (E) and the inhibitory (I) synaptic conductances, VE,I\nare their respective reversal potentials, \u03c4E,I are their respective time constants, aE,I\nare their respective peak conductances, and tE,I\nare the k-th spike times of the\nk\nrespective presynaptic neuron. The spike times of the respective presynaptic neuron\nare generated by an independent homogeneous Poisson process with the same rate\n\u03b3. The parameters are \u03c4E = 5[ms], \u03c4I = 10[ms], VE = 0[mV], VI = \u221280[mV],\naE = 0.01[\u03bcS/cm2], and aI = 0.04[\u03bcS/cm2 ], adopted from Chance et al. [7].\n2.4. f-I curve\nFor the LIF and LIFDT neurons, we calculated the f-I curves, which give the\nrelationship between the constant current m and the firing rate given a fixed synaptic\ninput rate \u03b3. The firing rate f is the number of spikes emitted by a neuron per unit\ntime, f = Nsp /T , where Nsp is the number of spikes and T is the observation time\ninterval. To calculate the f-I curve, we simulated Eqs (1), (2), and (3) with time step\n\u03b4t= 0.01[ms] and the time interval T = 50[s].\n3. Results\n3.1. Irreproducibility of the f-I curve by the LIF neuron\nWe compared the f-I curves of a cortical neuron obtained by Chance et al. [7] (Figure\n1A) to those of the LIF neuron (Figure 1B). We found that the LIF neuron cannot\nreproduce two main features of the f-I curves of a cortical neuron. The first is the\nonset of the f-I curve. The onset of the f-I curves of a cortical neuron are linear,\nwhereas those of the LIF neuron are nonlinear. The second irreproducible feature is\nthe asymptotic behavior of the f-I curve. The asymptotic behavior of the f-I curves\nof a cortical neuron are sublinear, whereas those of the LIF neuron are linear.\n\n3.2. Effect of the dynamical threshold on the f-I curve\nWe investigated the effect of the dynamical threshold on the onset of the f-I curve.\nTo quantify the nonlinearity of the onset, we fitted the onset of the f-I curve by using\nthe power function\nh(x) = c1 x\u03b2 + c0 ,\n\n\f4\n\nInfluence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation\n\nB\n\n70\n60\n\nf [Hz]\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nm [nA]\n\nFigure 1.

Figure\n2A shows the onset of the f-I curves of the LIFDT neuron with three values of A\u03b8 while\nthe synaptic input rate \u03b3 is kept fixed. Figure 2B shows the dependence of the onset\nnonlinearity \u03b2 on A\u03b8 . The onset of the LIF neuron (A\u03b8 = 0) is nonlinear\u2212\u03b2 = 2.0\u2212\nwhile the onset of the LIFDT neuron with large A\u03b8 is linear-like: \u03b2 = 1.3. The\ndynamical threshold linearizes the onset of the f-I curve.\nNext, we investigated the effect of the dynamical threshold on the asymptotic behavior\nof the f-I curve. Here, we derived the asymptotic formulae of the f-I curve. We used\nthe diffusion approximation [13, 14], wherein the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic\nconductances are approximated by the diffusion processes, and then we neglected the\ntime correlation of the synaptic conductances,\nr\nr\n\u03c4E \u03b3\n\u03c4I \u03b3\n\u03beE (t), gI (t) \u2248 aI \u03c4I \u03b3 + aI\n\u03beI (t)\n(4)\ngE (t) \u2248 aE \u03c4E \u03b3 + aE\n2\n2\nwhere \u03beE, I (t) are independent Gaussian white-noise processes of zero mean and unit\nSD. Using Eqs (1), (3), and (4), we obtain\nC\n\ndV\n= \u2212gL\u2217 (V \u2212 V\u221e ) + m + s(V )\u03be(t)\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\ngL\u2217 = gL + \u03b3(aE \u03c4E + aI \u03c4I ),\n\u03b3\ns2 (V ) = {a2E \u03c4E (V \u2212 VE )2 + a2I \u03c4I (V \u2212 VI )2 },\n2\nHere, \u03be(t) is a Gaussian white-noise process of zero mean and unit SD, and we assume\nthat the synaptic input is balanced, (aE \u03c4E + aI \u03c4I )V\u221e = aE \u03c4E VE + aI \u03c4I VI . We write\nthe firing rate of the LIF neuron (Eq. (5) ) with the threshold \u03b80 as fLIF (m, s(V ), \u03b80 ),\nand the firing rate of the LIFDT neuron as fDT (m, s(V )). For large constant input\ns(V ) \u226a m, we can neglect the contribution of the noise s(V ),\nfLIF (m, s, \u03b80 ) \u2248 fLIF (m, 0, \u03b80 ),\n\nfDT (m, s) \u2248 fDT (m, 0).\n\n\f5\n\nInfluence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation\nThe firing rate of the LIF neuron can be written as\nm\ng\u2217\n+ const.\nfLIF (m, 0, \u03b80 ) =\n\u0010 m/gL\u2217 +V\u221e \u2212Vr \u0011 \u223c\nC(\u03b8\n\u2212 Vr )\nL\n0\nC log m/g\u2217 +V\u221e \u2212\u03b80\n\n(6)\n\nL\n\nThe firing rate of the LIFDT neuron is given by the self-consistent solution [13] of\nfDT (m, 0) = fLIF ( m, 0, \u03b8\u221e + A\u03b8 \u03c4\u03b8 fDT (m, 0) ).\n\n(7)\n\nFrom Eq.

In the large m, these f-I curves approach Eqs (6) and (8). The\ndynamical threshold changes the asymptotic behavior of the f-I curves: the asymptotic\nbehavior of the LIF neuron is linear (f \u223c m), whereas that of the LIFDT neuron is\nsublinear (f \u223c m1/2 ).\n\nB\n\nA\n200\n\n2\n\n1.6\n\n100\n\n\u03b2\n\nf [Hz]\n\n150\n\n50\n1.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n0\n\nm [nA]\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nA\u03b8\n\nFigure 2.

Discussion\n4.1. Conclusion\nWe studied the effect of a dynamical threshold on the f-I curve. It is confirmed that\nthe dynamical threshold is essential for reproducing the f-I curve of a cortical neuron\nand that it modulates the onset and the asymptotic behavior of the f-I curve. These\nresults suggest that a cortical neuron has an adaptation mechanism and that this\nsignificantly influences the computation of a cortical neuron.\n4.2. Unresolved problems\nHere we state two unresolved problems relating to our study. The first is the\nclarification of the effect of adaptation on the network behavior of neurons. It\nwould be interesting to study the effect of adaptation on not only the behavior\nof a neuron but also on that of interacting neurons. The second open problem is\nthe clarification of the effect of the adaptation mechanism on the Hodgkin\u2212Huxleytype model neurons [4]. For the sake of simplicity, we studied LIF and LIFDT\nneurons in this paper. However, Hodgkin\u2212Huxley-type models are known to be more\nrealistic neuron models. It is currently thought that the adaptation mechanism mainly\narises from M-type currents, mAHP-type currents, and slow sodium currents in the\nHodgkin\u2212Huxley-type model [3, 8, 12]. It would be interesting to study the effect of\nthese currents on the f-I curve.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the organizing committee of UPoN 2008 for an interesting conference.
