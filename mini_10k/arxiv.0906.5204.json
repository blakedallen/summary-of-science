The QSH insulator is a novel topologically insulating phase with timereversal symmetry. A 2-dimensional QSH insulator has\na charge excitation gap in the bulk and gapless helical\nedge states. Two states with opposite spin-polarization\ncounter-propagate at a given edge1,4 . Due to the time reversal symmetry, these spin-filtered edge states are stable\nagainst weak interaction and disorder4,6 . Hence, they can\nbe viewed as effective spin and charge conducting channels, and could be used to construct promising spintronic\ndevices with low power consumption.\nRKKY interaction is an effective interaction between\ntwo local spins mediated by conduction electrons7 . It\nplays an important role in many fields of solid state\nphysics, e.g. giant magnetoresistance (GMR)8 , dilute\nmagnetic semiconductor (DMS)9 . More recently, people propose that the controllable RKKY interaction can\nbe used to manipulate the quantum states of the local spins, a crucial point for the spintronics and quantum computing10,11 . Thereafter, the RKKY interactions in different spintronic materials, e.g. spin-orbital\nsystem12,13,14 and graphene15,16,17,18 , have been investigated carefully in order to facilitate the further development of the spintronic devices. Compared with the normal cases, the effective interactions between local spins\nin these systems exhibit rather different properties. The\nRKKY interaction in the spin-orbital system becomes a\ntwisted exchange coupling since it is a spin-dependent\nsystem12,13,14 . The spin polarizations of the two local\nspins are no longer collinear in this case. As for the\ngraphene, due to its special electronic band dispersion,\nit is found that the RKKY interaction is ferromagnetic\n\nfor local spins within equivalent sublattices but antiferromagnetic for opposite sublattices when the Fermi level\nis near the Dirac point15,16 .\nBeing an novel spintronic material, it is an quite intriguing and practical problem that what the RKKY interaction in the QSH insulator is. Since the helical edge\nstates are the only conducting channels in this system,\nthe problem becomes that what the exchange interaction\nmediated by the helical edge states is.\nIn this paper, we investigate the RKKY interaction\nmediated by the helical edge states in the QSH insulator. Our theoretical analyzing is mainly based on the\nsimplified model of the helical edge state2,4,5 , in which\nthe spin of the carriers is assumed to be parallel or antiparallel along the z axis as shown in Fig. 1. Actually,\nit is proposed that the QSH insulator could be realized\nin various kinds of systems, e.g. graphene1 , quantum\nwell2,3 , or semiconductor materials with special strain\ngradient4,5 . The descriptions of the helical edge state in\ndifferent systems may be different. However, the model\nwe used is the simplest and most basic one. It grasps the\nprimary characteristic of the helical states, i.e. the correlation between the spin polarization and propagation of\nthe carrier, and also is the exact expression of the helical edge states in the semiconductor system with special\nstrain gradient. Hence, we believe that this model is a\ngood starting point for analyzing of the RKKY interaction mediated by the helical edge state.\nWe find that the helical property and the linear dispersion of the edge conducting electrons will lead to an\nin-plane and noncollinear exchange coupling between two\nlocal spins along the edge. In the asymptotic limit, this\ninteraction has a simple expression. We can see that the\nangle between the two spins can be controlled by adjusting the the Fermi energy of the system. When the Fermi\nsurface is near the Dirac point, i.e. the Fermi energy is\nnear zero, the effective interaction becomes a constant\nantiferromagnetic exchange coupling. Actually, due to\nthe helicity, pure spin current can be achieved in these\nedge states. Hence, this effective coupling can also be\nviewed as RKKY interaction mediated by pure spin cur-\n\n\f2\nIf the coupling J is small, H1 can be treated as a perturbation on H0 . The RKKY interaction between two\nlocal spins S1 and S2 can be calculated from the second\norder perturbation theory12,14,23\nERK\n\nJ2\n= \u2212 Im\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nEF\n\nd\u03c9T r[(S1 * \u03c3)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(3)\n\n\u00d7Gr (R12 ; \u03c9)(S2 * \u03c3)Gr (\u2212R12 ; \u03c9)]\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the RKKY interaction between two local\nspins mediated by the helical edge states in QSH insulator.\nThe QSH insulator is assumed to be a finite strip geometry\nwhich is infinite along the x direction. Two local spins S1 and\nS2 are located along one edge of the QSH insulator. The solid\n(dashed) line represent the up spin right movers (down spin\nleft movers) of the helical edge states on this edge.\n\nrent.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the\nRKKY interaction mediated by the helical edge states\nof QSH insulator is derived. In Sec. III, we discuss the\nspecial properties of this exchange interaction. Finally, a\nbrief summary will be given in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND FORMALISM\n\nWe consider the simplest model of helical edge states\nwhich has been successfully used in the study of the tunneling properties of the helical edge states in the QSH\ninsulator4,19,20 . The schematic is shown in Fig. 1. The\nhelicity correlates the spin polarization with the propagation. Here, we assume that the right(left) movers \u03c8R\u2191\n(\u03c8L\u2193 ) carry spin up(down). In the noninteracting case,\nthe linearized Hamiltonian is\nZ\n+\n+\nH0 = \u2212vF dx(\u03c8R\u2191\ni\u2202x \u03c8R\u2191 \u2212 \u03c8L\u2193\ni\u2202x \u03c8L\u2193 )\n(1)\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity.\nThe localized spins are magnetic impurities and are\ndenoted by S1 and S2 . Normally the Kondo coupling\nbetween the local moments and conducting electrons are\nZ\nJ X\nH1 = \u2212\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 * Si dx\u03c8\u03b1+ (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 xi )\u03c8\u03b2 (x) (2)\n2 i=1,2\n\u03b1,\u03b2=\u2191,\u2193\n\nwhere J is the coupling constant, \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 is the spin operator of the conducting electrons. \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the spin\nindices. i = 1, 2 is the index of the local spins since in order to study the RKKY interaction, we need to consider\ntwo local spins . For the helical edge states, the only\ndifference is the spin polarization is correlated with the\npropagation. Hence in the Kondo coupling expression\nof the helical edge states, \u03c8\u2191 (x) (\u03c8\u2193 (x)) means \u03c8R\u2191 (x)\n(\u03c8L\u2193 (x))4,21 .\n\nwhere EF is the Fermi energy, R12 = x1 \u2212 x2 is the distance between the two local spins and Tr means the trace\nover the spin degree of freedom of conduction electrons.\nTherefore, the study of RKKY interaction has been reduced to the calculation of the retarded Green's function\nof the helical edge states.\nThe definition of retarded Green's function is\nGr\u03b1\u03b2 (xt, x\u2032 t\u2032 ) = \u2212i\u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )h{\u03c8\u03b1 (xt), \u03c8\u03b2+ (x\u2032 t\u2032 )}i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = {R \u2191, L \u2193} are the helical spin indices.\nThe calculation of Green's function is quite straightforward. Because that there is no coupling between different\nspins in the noninteracting Hamiltonian (1), the nonzero\nGreen's functions are GrR\u2191R\u2191 (x, x\u2032 ) and GrL\u2193L\u2193 (x, x\u2032 ).\nTake GrR\u2191R\u2191 (x, x\u2032 ) for example,\nGrR\u2191R\u2191 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9) =\n=\n\nZ\n\ndtei\u03c9t GrR\u2191R\u2191 (xt, x\u2032 t\u2032 )\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\ndk\n\neik(x\u2212x )\nC\u039b (|k|)\n\u03c9 \u2212 vF k + i\u03b7\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cutoff of the momentum and C\u039b (|k|) is the\ncutting off function. Since our model is a low energy approximation, a cutoff of the momentum is necessary and\naccording to the discussion in the study of Graphene16 ,\na sharp cutoff is not suitable here. Therefore, we use a\nsmooth cutting function\nC\u039b (|k|) = e\u2212\n\n|k|\n\u039b\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nWith this cutting off function, we get\nGrR\u2191R\u2191 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9) = \u2212\n\ni\n\u2212 |\u03c9|\ni \u03c9 (x\u2212x\u2032 )\n* e vF \u039b * e vF\n\u03b8(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) (7)\nvF\n\nwhere \u03b8(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) is a step function. The retarded Green's\nfunction of the left movers is\nGrL\u2193L\u2193 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9) =\n\u2212\n\ni\n\u2212 |\u03c9|\ni \u03c9 (x\u2032 \u2212x)\n* e vF \u039b * e vF\n\u03b8(x\u2032 \u2212 x) (8)\nvF\n\n|\u03c9|\n\nHere, e vF \u039b is the decay factor of the retarded Green's\nfunction.

In this case,\n\u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03c0/2 means that S1 and S2 are in-plane. And\ncos[(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) + \u03b1] = \u22121 shows that the exchange interaction is noncollinear. It means that the effective exchange\ninteraction mediated by the helical edge states is an inplane and noncollinear coupling. Actually, it is easy to\nsee from the expressions that in-plane and noncollinear\nare the general characteristics of the helical edge states\nmediated exchange interaction which does not depend on\nthe continuum limit.\nIn the continuum limit, the angle between the local\nF\nspins is determined by \u03b1 = 2|R|E\n, i.e. the Fermi envF\nergy EF and the distance R. Especially when the Fermi\nenergy EF = 0, i.e. the Fermi level is around the Dirac\npoint, \u03b1 = 0 and \u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 = \u03c0. It means that the exchange\ncoupling becomes a constant and is always antiferromagnetic. Here, the Dirac point is the crossing of the bands\nof right and left movers. However, in general cases, we\ndo not have a simple formula about the angle between\nthe local spins. It should be determined though concrete\nnumerical calculation.\nThe special characteristics of the helical edge states\nmediated exchange interaction result from the interplay\nbetween the helicity and the linear band dispersion. As\nshown in former studies, without helicity, if the system\nis spin-independent, the coupling will have similar form\nF (R)S1 *S2 and the only difference is just the range function F (R). In our case, the helicity makes the system\nspin-dependent: though the matrix of Green's function\nis still diagonal but GrR\u2191R\u2191 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9) 6= GrL\u2193L\u2193 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9). It\nis the main reason of the noncollinear behavior of the\nexchange coupling. In addition to the helicity, the linear\n\n\f4\nband dispersion induces opposite step functions into the\nGreen's functions as shown in Eq. (7) and (8). Actually, the in-plane characteristic of the exchange interaction mainly results from these step functions.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, based on the simplified model of the helical edge states, we have investigated the helical edge\nstates that mediate RKKY interaction between local\nspins in the QSH system. Since the conducting electrons in the helical edge states are the only carriers in\nthe QSH insulator, this exchange interaction is probably\nthe only possible mechanism of the exchange coupling\nbetween local spins in such a promising spintronic system. Furthermore, due to the helicity, i.e. the correlation\nbetween the spin polarization and propagation, it is believed that pure spin current can be realized in this edge\nstate. It means that this exchange interaction is actually\nan exchange interaction mediated by pure spin current.\nHence, this problem is not only of fundamental interest\nbut also useful for the future development of spin-based\ndevices in such systems.\nWe analyze the simplest theoretical model of the helical\n\n1\n\nC.

We find that the RKKY\ninteraction mediated by this helical edge state in such a\nsystem is in-plane and noncollinear, which is extremely\ndifferent from the exchange interaction in other systems.\nThe angle between the local spins depends on the Fermi\nenergy of the system. Therefor, this effective interaction\noffers a possible way to control such angle through adjusting the fermi level by a gate. In the continuum limit,\na simple expression of this exchange interaction can be\nachieved. Especially, when the Fermi level is around the\nDirac point, the exchange coupling becomes a constant\nantiferromagnetic one. We also point out that these peculiar properties result from the interplay between the\nhelicity and the linear band dispersion.\nHowever, our study is based on the noninteracting low\nenergy approximation model of the helical edge states.\nFor a concrete material or experimental setup, many\nmore practical factors may need to be included. We believe that our analysis is a good starting point for the\nfurther investigation.\nAcknowledgments: We wish to acknowledge the\npartial support from RGC grant of HKSAR.
