Adiabatic growth of\nblack holes generates power-law central density profiles with slopes in the range 1.5 <\n\u223c \u2212d log \u03c1/d log r <\n\u223c\n2.5, in good agreement with the profiles observed in the nuclei of galaxies fainter than MV \u2248 \u221220.\nHowever the shallow nuclear profiles of bright galaxies require a different explanation. Binary black\nholes are an inevitable result of galactic mergers, and the ejection of stars by a massive binary displaces\na mass of order the binary's own mass, creating a core or shallow power-law cusp. This model is at\nleast crudely consistent with core sizes in bright galaxies. Uncertainties remain about the effectiveness\nof stellar- and gas-dynamical processes at inducing coalescence of binary black holes, and uncoalesced\nbinaries may be common in low-density nuclei. Numerical N -body experiments are not well suited to\nprobing the long-term evolution of black hole binaries due to spurious relaxation.\na model and rh is the radius at which the circular velocity\naround the black hole equals \u03c3. We now know that nuclei\nare power laws in the stellar density, \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212\u03b3 , and that\n\u03b3 can lie anywhere between \u223c 0 and \u223c 2.5 (Lauer, this\nvolume). The velocity dispersion in a power-law nucleus\nis only constant if \u03b3 = 0 or 2, hence a definition like equation (1) is problematic. One alternative would be to define\nrh as the root of \u03c3 2 (r) \u2212 GM\u2022 /r = 0. A simpler definition,\nwhich will be adopted in this article, is the radius at which\nthe enclosed mass in stars is twice the black hole mass:\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe effect of a supermassive black hole on its stellar\nsurroundings depends, as so often in stellar dynamics, on\nhow one imagines the system evolved to its present state.\nCollisional relaxation times are too long to have affected\nthe stellar distribution in all but the densest nuclei (Faber\net al. 1997), hence the structure and kinematics of nuclei\nare fossil relics of the interactions between stars and black\nholes. In the simplest scenario, the black hole grows by\naccreting gas on a time scale long compared with the orbital periods of the surrounding stars (Peebles 1972; Young\n1980). This \"adiabatic growth\" model makes fairly definite predictions about the distribution of stars near the\nblack hole, predictions which are consistent with the steep\ndensity cusps observed in faint galaxies but which can not\nexplain the flatter profiles at the centers of bright galaxies. But galaxies merge, implying the formation of binary\nblack holes (Begelman, Blandford & Rees 1980) which are\nefficient at displacing matter as they spiral together. The\ndynamics of black hole binaries in galactic nuclei are complex; among the unanswered questions are the long-term\nefficiency of stellar dynamical processes at extracting energy from a binary, and whether decay of black hole binaries ever stalls at separations too great for the efficient\nemission of gravitational waves. But the binary black hole\nmodel is at least crudely consistent with the observed dependence of nuclear structure on galaxy luminosity. This\narticle summarizes theoretical work on the single and binary black hole models and suggests avenues for future\nprogress.\n\nM\u2217 (r < rh ) = 2M\u2022 .\n\n(2)\n\nThis definition is exactly equivalent to equation (1) when\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c3 2 /2\u03c0Gr2 , the singular isothermal sphere. For an\narbitrary power law,\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b3\nr\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c10\n,\n(3)\nr0\nequation (2) implies\nrh = r0\n\n\u0012\n\n3 \u2212 \u03b3 M\u2022\n2\u03c0 \u03c10 r03\n\n\u00131/(3\u2212\u03b3)\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nNote that the \"theorist's\" convention is adopted here, in\nwhich \u03b3 is the power-law index of the space (not projected)\ndensity.\n3. THE ADIABATIC GROWTH MODEL\n\nIf a black hole grows at the center of a stellar system\nthrough the accretion of gas, the stellar density in the\ncore will also grow as the black hole's gravity pulls in\nnearby stars (Peebles 1972; Young 1980). The change in\nthe stellar density can be computed straightforwardly if it\nis assumed that the black hole grows on a time scale long\ncompared with stellar orbital periods. This is reasonable,\nsince even Eddington-limited accretion requires \u223c 108 yr\nto double the black hole mass, and orbital periods through6\nout the region dominated by the black hole are <\n\u223c 10 yr.\nUnder these assumptions, the adiabatic invariants J associated with the stellar orbits are conserved as the black\nhole grows and the phase-space density f remains fixed\n\n2. PRELIMINARIES\n\nA black hole of mass M\u2022 embedded in a galactic nucleus\nwill strongly affect the motion of stars within a distance\nr = rh , the \"radius of influence.\" A standard definition\nfor rh is\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22122\nGM\u2022\n\u03c3\nM\u2022\nrh \u2261\n\u2248 10.8 pc\n(1)\n\u03c32\n108 M\u2299\n200 km s\u22121\nwith \u03c3 the 1D velocity dispersion of the stars at r \u226b rh .\nThis definition had its origin in the isothermal sphere\nmodel for galactic nuclei; \u03c3 is independent of r in such\n1\n\n\f2\nwhen expressed in terms of the J. Computing the final f\nbecomes a simple matter of expressing the final orbital integrals in terms of their initial values under the constraint\nthat the adiabatic invariants remain fixed (Young 1980).\nIn spherical potentials, the adiabatic invariants are\nthe\nmomentum L and the radial action I =\np\nR r+angular\n2 r\u2212 2 [E \u2212 \u03a6(r)] \u2212 L2 /r2 , where \u03a6(r) is the gravitational potential and r\u00b1 are pericenter and apocenter radii.\nIt may be shown (e.g. Lynden-Bell 1963) that orbital\nshapes remain nearly unchanged when L and I are conserved, implying that an initially isotropic velocity distribution f (E) remains nearly isotropic after the black hole\ngrows (though not exactly isotropic \u2013 see below). The final\nf corresponding to an initially isotropic f is then simply\nff (Ef , L) = fi (Ei , L)\n\u2248 ff (Ef )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ef is related to Ei through the condition If (Ef , L) =\nIi (Ei , L).\nWhile the form of the nuclear density profile before the\nblack hole appeared is not known, N -body studies of structure formation suggest that power laws are generic (Power\net al. 2003 and references therein) and observed nuclear\ndensity profiles are often well described as power laws\neven on scales r \u226b rh . Setting \u03c1i \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 , \u03a6i \u221d r2\u2212\u03b30\n(0 < \u03b30 < 2), the initial distribution function becomes\nfi (Ei ) \u221d Ei\u2212\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b2=\n\n6 \u2212 \u03b30\n2(2 \u2212 \u03b30 )\n\n(0 < \u03b30 < 2).\n\n(6)\n\nTo compute ff (Ef ) we need a relation between Ef and\nEi ; we restrict attention to the region within the black\nhole's sphere of influence by setting Ef = v 2 /2 \u2212 GM\u2022 /r.\nThe radial action I(E, L) in the power-law model can not\nbe computed analytically for every (E, L), but for certain orbits Ef (Ei ) has a simple form. For instance, circular orbits have I = 0, and conservation of angular momentum implies ri Mi (ri ) = rf M\u2022 or rf \u221d ri4\u2212\u03b30 . Thus\n(\u03b3 \u22124)/(2\u2212\u03b30 )\n, or\nEf \u221d \u2212rf\u22121 \u221d \u2212ri\u03b30 \u22124 \u221d \u2212Ei 0\nEi \u221d (\u2212Ef )\u2212(2\u2212\u03b30 )/(4\u2212\u03b30 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe same relation turns out to be precisely correct for\nradial orbits as well and is nearly correct at intermediate\neccentricities (Gondolo & Silk 1999). Thus we can write\nff (Ef ) = fi (Ei ) \u221d Ei\u2212\u03b2 \u221d (\u2212Ef )\u03b4 ,\n\n\u03b4=\n\n6 \u2212 \u03b30\n(8)\n2(4 \u2212 \u03b30 )\n\nand the final density profile within the sphere of influence\nof the black hole is\nZ\nZ 0\np\n\u03c1f (r) = ff (v)d3 v \u221d\n(\u2212E)\u03b4 E \u2212 \u03a6(r) dE\n\u03a6(r)\n\n\u221dr\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\n,\n\n\u03b3 =2+\n\n1\n.\n4 \u2212 \u03b30\n\n(9)\n\nFor 0 < \u03b30 < 2, \u03b3 varies only between 2.25 and 2.5; the\nslope of the final density profile within rh is almost independent of \u03b30 .\nThe form of \u03c1f (r) at r \u2248 rh must be computed numerically (e. g. Young 1980; Cipollina & Bertin 1994; Cipollina 1995; Quinlan, Hernquist & Sigurdsson 1995; Gondolo\n\n& Silk 1999). Figure 1 shows \u03c1f (r) when \u03c1i (r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 .\nDefining rcusp to be the radius at which the inner and\nouter power laws intersect, one finds\nrcusp = \u03b1rh , 0.19 <\n\u223c\u03b1<\n\u223c 0.22, 0.5 \u2264 \u03b30 \u2264 1.5. (10)\n\nIn early treatments of the adiabatic growth model (Peebles 1972; Young 1980), the black hole was assumed to\ngrow inside of a constant-density isothermal core. The index of the power-law cusp that forms from this initial state\nis \u03b3 = 1.5, compared with the limiting valure \u03b3 = 2.25 as\n\u03b30 \u2192 0 in the power-law models. This difference can be\ntraced to differences in the central density profile:\n\u0001\n\u03c1i (r) = \u03c10 \u00d7 1 + C1 r + C2 r2 + ... .\n(11)\n\nThe isothermal model has C1 = 0 (an \"analytic core\")\nimplying a phase space density that tends to a constant\nvalue at low energies. Other sorts of cores have C1 6= 0 and\nf diverges at low energies; for instance, the core produced\nby setting \u03b3 = 0 in \u03c1(r) = r\u2212\u03b3 (1 + r)\u22124 has f (E) \u2192\n[E \u2212 \u03a6(0)]\u22121 . In fact models with finite central \u03c1's can\nbe found that generate final cusp slopes anywhere in the\nrange 1.5 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 2.25 (Quinlan, Hernquist & Sigurdsson\n1995). There is probably no way of ruling out an analytic\ncore in the progenitor galaxy on the very small scales that\nare relevant to the later formation of a cusp, hence the\nadiabatic growth model is compatible with any final slope\nin the range 1.5 <\n\u223c 2.5. The upper limit could even be\n\u223c\u03b3<\nextended beyond 2.5 if \u03b30 > 2.\nHow do these predictions compare with the data? Observed luminosity profiles are well described as power laws\nat the smallest resolvable radii, and in the case of faint\nellipticals, MV >\n\u223c \u221220, the observed range of slopes is\n<\n2.5\n(Lauer,\nthis volume). This is precisely the\n\u03b3\n1.5 <\n\u223c \u223c\nrange in \u03b3 predicted by the adiabatic growth model. However in bright galaxies, \u03b3 extends down to \u223c 0. A natural\ninterpretation is that the steep cusps in faint galaxies are\na result of adiabatic black hole growth, while some additional mechanism, like mergers, has acted to modify the\nprofiles in the brighter galaxies.\nSome fine tuning is still required to reproduce the luminosity profiles of galaxies with 1.5 <\n\u223c \u03b3 <\n\u223c 2. These\nintermediate slopes require a shallow, core-like initial profile, and if the initial core radius exceeded \u223c rh , the final\nprofile will exhibit an upward inflection at r \u2248 rh (e.g.\nFigure 2 of Young 1980; Figure 1). Such inflections are\nrarely if ever seen; observed profiles have slopes that decrease smoothly inward. A way out is to require that the\nblack hole mass exceeds the initial core mass so that its\ngrowth obliterates the core; alternatively, all nuclei with\n\u03b3<\n\u223c 2 may have been the products of mergers.\nAn ingenious attempt to reconcile the adiabatic growth\nmodel with both steep and shallow cusps was made by van\nder Marel (1999). He postulated the existence of isothermal cores in the progenitor galaxies with core masses scaling as \u223c L1.5 , with L the total galaxy luminosity. Since\nM\u2022 \u223c L, M\u2022 /Mcore \u223c L\u22120.5 and the black holes in faint\ngalaxies would grow to dominate their cores, producing a\ncusp profile that approximates the featureless power laws\nof faint galaxies. In bright galaxies, van der Marel argued\nthat the upward inflection at r <\n\u223c rh would be difficult\nto resolve; hence these galaxies would exhibit nearly unperturbed core profiles. Van der Marel's model is intriguing, although the assumed relation between core size and\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Influence of the adiabatic growth of a black hole on its nuclear environment in a spherical, isotropic galaxy. (a) Density profiles\nafter growth of the black hole. Initial profiles were power laws, \u03c1i \u221d r \u2212\u03b30 , with \u03b30 increasing upwards in steps of 0.25. The radial scale is\nnormalized to rh as defined in the initial galaxy (eq. 2). The slope of the final profile at r < rh is almost independent of the initial slope. (b)\nVelocity anisotropies after growth of the black hole. A slight bias toward circular motions appears at r < rh .\n\ngalaxy luminosity is ad hoc, and the assumption of large,\npre-existing cores does not fit naturally into any current\nmodel of galaxy formation.\nThe predictions of the adiabatic growth model can be\naltered if the initial galaxy is anistropic, non-spherical or\nrotating. The simplest such case to treat is a spherical\nnucleus containing only circular orbits, with or without\nrotation (Young 1980; Quinlan, Hernquist & Sigurdsson\n1995; Ullio, Zhao & Kamionkowski 2001). The derivation\ngiven above applies without approximations to this case: if\nthe initial density profile is a power law, \u03c1i \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 , the final profile is also a power law with \u03b3 = 2 + 1/(4 \u2212 \u03b30 ),\nfor any \u03b30 in the range [0, 3]. As shown above, the\nisotropic model yields approximately the same final slope\nfor 0 < \u03b30 < 2, suggesting that even extreme tangential\nanisotropies have little effect on the final profile. The effect of radial anistropies has apparently never been investigated; this is worth doing since real galaxies often show\nevidence for significant radial anisotropies (e.g. Kronawitter et al. 2000).\nBlack hole growth in axisymmetric nuclei with analytic\ncores was considered by Leeuwin & Athanassoula (2000).\nThey found little dependence of the final cusp slope on\nthe degree of flattening. Merritt & Quinlan (1998) grew\nblack holes of various masses in a triaxial N -body model\nthat was formed via gravitational collapse, and found \u03c1 \u223c\nr\u22122 at r <\n\u223c rh . Their models evolved to axisymmetry\nafter growth of the black hole, but it is now known that\ntriaxiality can be maintained throughout the black hole's\nsphere of influence (Poon & Merritt 2002, 2003). Triaxial\npotentials support a wide range of different orbit families\nand the effects of black hole growth on such models have\nnot been examined in detail.\nIn the spherical geometry, adiabatic growth of a black\n\nhole induces a mild anisotropy in the stellar motions at\nr <\n\u223c rh due to the slightly different ways that circular\nand eccentric orbits respond to the changing potential;\nthe net effect is a decrease in the average orbital eccentricity (Young 1980; Goodman & Binney 1984; Quinlan,\nHernquist & Sigurdsson 1995; Figure 1). If the progenitor galaxy is rotating, growth of the black hole tends to\nincrease Vrot more rapidly than \u03c3 (Lee & Goodman 1989;\nLeeuwin & Athanassoula 2000), although again the effect\nis slight.\nTo summarize: the adiabatic growth model is limited in\nits ability to reproduce the full range of luminosity profiles\nobserved in galactic nuclei. The model predicts powerlaw profiles at r <\n\u223c rh with logarithmic slopes 1.5 <\n\u223c\u03b3 <\n\u223c\n2.5. This nicely brackets the range of slopes observed in\nthe nuclei of galaxies fainter than MV \u2248 \u221220. However\nslopes less than \u03b3 \u2248 1.5 are not naturally produced by the\nadiabatic growth model, and some fine tuning is required\nto avoid inflections in the profile at r \u2248 rh .\n4. THE BINARY BLACK HOLE MODEL\n\nThe adiabatic growth model was proposed (Peebles\n1972) before the importance of galaxy interactions and\nmergers was appreciated. We now know that supermassive\nblack holes have been present in at least some spheroids\nsince redshifts of z \u2248 6 (e.g. Fan et al. 2001), and we\nbelieve that most galaxies have experienced at least one\nmajor merger since that time; indeed the era of peak\nquasar activity may coincide with the era of galaxy assembly via mergers (e.g. Caviliere & Vittorini 2000). If\na nucleus forms via the merger of two galaxies containing pre-existing black holes, the net effect on the nuclear\ndensity profile is roughly the opposite of what the adiabatic growth model predicts: the black holes displace\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.- Two schemes for growing black holes at the centers of galaxies. (a) The adiabatic growth model; the stellar density within rh is\nincreased as the black hole pulls in stars. (b) The binary black hole model; the inspiralling black holes displace matter within a distance rc\nthat is roughly the separation between the two black holes when they first form a bound pair.\n\nmatter as they spiral into the center (Figure 2). This is\na natural way to account for the shallow nuclear profiles\nin bright galaxies. The process may be understood as a\nsort of dynamical friction, with the \"heavy particles\" (the\nblack holes) transferring their kinetic energy to the \"light\nparticles\" (the stars). However most of the energy transfer takes place after the two black holes have come within\neach other's sphere of influence, and in this regime, the\ninteraction with the background is dominated by another\nmechanism, the gravitational slingshot (Saslaw, Valtonen\n& Aarseth 1974). The massive binary ejects passing stars\nat high velocities, removing them from the nucleus and\nsimultaneously increasing its binding energy.\nWe begin by reviewing the dynamics of massive binaries in fixed, homogeneous backgrounds, then consider the\nmore difficult problem of a binary located at the center of\nan inhomogeneous and evolving galaxy.\n4.1. Dynamics of Massive Binaries\nConsider a binary system consisting of two black holes\nwith masses M1 and M2 , where p \u2261 M2 /M1 \u2264 1 and\nM12 \u2261 M1 + M2 . Let a be the semi-major axis of the\nKeplerian orbit and e the orbital eccentricity. The binding\nenergy of the binary is\n|E| =\n\nGM1 M2\nG\u03bcM12\n=\n,\n2a\n2a\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03bc = M1 M2 /M12 the reduced mass. The relative velocity of the two black holes, assuming a circular orbit,\n\nis\nVbin =\n\nr\n\nGM12\n= 658 km s\u22121\na\n\n\u0012\n\nM12\n108 M\u2299\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\na\n1 pc\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(13)\nA binary is called \"hard\" when its binding energy per unit\nmass, |E|/M12 = G\u03bc/2a, exceeds \u223c \u03c3 2 . For concreteness,\na binary will here be called hard if its separation falls below\nah , where\n\u0013\u22122\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\nG\u03bc\nM2\n\u03c3\n\u22121\nah \u2261 2 \u2248 0.27 pc (1 + p)\n.\n4\u03c3\n107 M\u2299\n200 km s\u22121\n(14)\nOther definitions of ah are possible (e. g. Hills 1983;\nQuinlan 1996).\nStars passing within a distance \u223c 3a of the center of\nmass of a hard binary undergo a complex interaction with\nthe two black p\nholes, followed almost always by ejection\nat velocity \u223c \u03bc/M12 Vbin (Saslaw, Valtonen & Aarseth\n1974). Each ejected star carries away energy and angular momentum, causing the semi-major axis, eccentricity\nand orientation of the binary to change and the local density of stars to drop. If the stellar distribution is assumed\nfixed far from the binary and if the contribution to the\npotential from the stars is ignored, the rate at which these\nchanges occur can be computed by carrying out scattering experiments of massless stars against a binary whose\norbital elements remains fixed during each interaction.\nThe results of the scattering experiments can be summarized via a set of dimensionless coefficients H, J, K, L, ...\nwhich define the mean rates of change of the parameters\ncharacterizing the binary and the stellar background (Hills\n\n\f5\n& Fullerton 1980; Roos 1981; Hills 1983, 1992; Baranov\n1984; Mikkola & Valtonen 1992; Quinlan 1996; Merritt\n2001, 2002). These coefficients are functions of the binary\nmass ratio, eccentricity and hardness but are typically independent of a in the limit that the binary is very hard.\nThe hardening rate of the binary is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nG\u03c1\nd 1\n=H\n(15)\ndt a\n\u03c3\nwith \u03c1 the density of stars at infinity. The mass ejection\nrate is\ndMej\n= JM12\n(16)\nd ln(1/a)\nwith Mej the mass in stars that escape the binary. The\nrate of change of the binary's orbital eccentricity is\nde\n= K.\nd ln(1/a)\n\nFig. 3.- Mass ejected by a decaying binary, in units of M12 =\nM1 + M2 (solid lines) or M2 (dashed lines). Curves show mass that\nmust be ejected in order for the binary to reach a separation where\nthe emission of gravity waves causes coalescence on a time scale of\n1010 yr (lower), 109 yr (middle) and 108 yr (upper).\n\n(17)\n\nThe diffusion coefficient describing changes in the binary's\norientation is\nm\u2217 G\u03c1a\nh\u2206\u03b82 i = L\n(18)\nM12 \u03c3\n\nah to agr is given by the integral of equation (16):\nZ ah\nJ(a)\nMej = M12\nda.\na\nagr\n\nwith m\u2217 the stellar mass. Additional coefficients describe\nthe rate of diffusion of the binary's center of mass, or\n\"Brownian motion\" (Merritt 2001).\nThe binary hardening coefficient H reaches a constant\nvalue of \u223c 16 in the limit a \u226a ah , with a weak dependence\non M2 /M1 (Hills 1983; Mikkola & Valtonen 1992; Quinlan 1996). In a fixed background, equation (15) therefore\nimplies that a hard binary hardens at a constant rate:\n1\nG\u03c1\n1\n\u2248H\n\u2212\n(t \u2212 th ) ,\na(t) ah\n\u03c3\n\nt \u2265 th ,\n\na(th ) = ah . (19)\n\nIf the supply of stars remains steady, hardening continues\nat this rate until the components of the binary come close\nenough together that the emission of gravitational radiation is important. In this regime, gravity wave coalescence\ntakes place in a time:\n5\nc5\n4\n2 a ,\n3\n256F (e) G \u03bcM12\n\u0013\n\u0012\n37\n73\nF (e) = (1 \u2212 e2 )\u22127/2 1 + e2 + e4\n24\n96\ntgr =\n\n(20)\n\n(Peters 1964).

For mass ratios p of order unity and e \u2248 0, the binary\nmust decay by a factor of \u223c 102 in order for gravitational\nradiation to induce coalescence in a time shorter than 109\nyr. Less decay is required if the binary is eccentric or if\nM2 \u226a M1 .\nIf the binary manages to shrink by such a large factor,\nthe damage done to its stellar surroundings will be considerable. The mass ejected by the binary in decaying from\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nFigure 1.2 shows Mej as a function of the mass ratio\nM2 /M1 for \u03c3 = 200 km s\u22121 and various values of tgr .\nThe mass ejected in reaching coalescence is of order M12\nfor equal-mass binaries, and several times M2 when M2 \u226a\nM1 . A black hole that grew to its current size through\na succession of mergers should therefore have displaced a\nfew times its own mass in stars. If this mass came mostly\nfrom stars that were originally in the nucleus, the density within rh would drop drastically and the hardening\nwould slow. Without some way of replenishing the supply\nof stars, decay could stall at a separation much greater\nthan agr . This is the \"final parsec problem\": how to avoid\nstalling and bring the black holes from their separation of\n\u223c 1 pc, when they first form a hard binary, to \u223c 10\u22122 pc,\nwhere gravity wave emission is efficient.\nChanges in the binary's orbital eccentricity (equation\n17) are potentially important because the gravity wave\ncoalescence time drops rapidly as e \u2192 1 (equation 20). For\na hard binary, scattering experiments give K(e) \u2248 K0 e(1\u2212\ne2 ), with K0 \u2248 0.5 for an equal-mass binary (Mikkola &\nValtonen 1992; Quinlan 1996). The dependence of K on\nM2 /M1 is not well understood. The implied changes in e\nas a binary decays from a = ah to agr are modest, \u2206e <\n\u223c\n0.2, for all initial eccentricities. The rms change in the\norientation of the binary's spin axis (equation 18) is \u03b4\u03b8 \u2248\n2(m\u2217 /M12 )1/2 log1/2 (ah /a), which is of order one degree or\nless if m\u2217 \u2248 M\u2299 . Reorientations of the binary's angular\nmomentum affect the spin direction of the coalesced black\nhole and the direction of any associated jet (Merritt 2002).\n4.2. Binary Black Holes in Galaxies\nThe scattering experiments summarized above treat the\nbinary's environment as fixed and homogeneous. In reality, the binary is embedded at the center of an inhomogeneous and evolving galaxy, and the supply of stars that\ncan interact with it is limited.\n\n\f6\nIn a fixed spherical galaxy, stars can interact with the\nbinary only if their pericenters lie within\np \u223c R \u00d7 a, where\nR\nis\nof\norder\nunity.\nLet\nL\n=\nRa\n2 [E \u2212 \u03a6(Ra)] \u2248\nlc\n\u221a\n2GM12 Ra, the angular momentum of a star with pericenter Ra. The \"loss cone\" is the region in phase space\ndefined by L \u2264 Llc . The mass of stars in the loss cone is\nMlc (a) = m\u2217\n\nZ\nZ\n\ndE\n\nZ\n\nLlc\n\ndL N (E, L2 )\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nL2lc\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndL 4\u03c0 f (E, L )P (E, L )\nZ\n\u2248 8\u03c0 2 GM12 m\u2217 Ra dEf (E)Prad (E).\n(23)\n\n= m\u2217\n\ndE\n\n0\n\nHere P is the orbital period; in the final line, f is assumed\nisotropic and P has been approximated by the period of a\nradial orbit of energy E. An upper limit to the mass that\nis available to interact with the binary is \u223c Mlc (ah ), the\nmass within the loss cone when the binary first becomes\nhard; this is an upper limit since some stars that are initially within the loss cone will \"fall out\" as the binary\nshrinks. Assuming a singular isothermal sphere for the\nstellar distribution, \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 , and taking the lower limit of\nthe energy integral to be \u03a6(ah ), equation (23) implies\nMlc (ah ) \u2248 3R\u03bc.\n\n(24)\n\nWe can compute the change in a that would result if the\nbinary interacted with this entire mass, by using the fact\nthe mean energy change of a star interacting with a hard\nbinary is \u223c 3G\u03bc/2a (Quinlan 1996). Equating the energy carried away by stars with the change in the binary's\nbinding energy gives\n\u0012 \u0013\n3 G\u03bc\nGM1 M2\n1\n(25)\ndM \u2248\nd\n2 a\n2\na\nor\nln\n\n\u0010a \u0011\nh\n\na\n\n\u22483\n\n9R\u03bc\np\n\u2206M\n\u2248\n\u2248 9R\n,\nM12\nM12\n(1 + p)2\n\np \u2261 M2 /M1\n\n(26)\nif \u2206M is equated with Mlc . Only for very low mass ratios\n\u22123\n(M2 <\n\u223c 10 M1 ) is this decay factor large enough to satisfy equation (21), but the time required for such a small\nblack hole to reach the nucleus is likely to exceed a Hubble\ntime (Merritt 2000). Hence even under the most favorable\nassumptions, the binary would not be able to interact with\nenough mass to reach gravity-wave coalescence.\nBut the situation is even worse than this, since not all of\nthe mass in the loss cone will find its way into the binary.\nThe time scale for the binary to shrink is comparable with\nstellar orbital periods, and some of the stars with rperi \u2248\nah will only reach the binary after a has fallen below \u223c ah .\nWe can account for the changing size of the loss cone by\nwriting\nZ \u221e\ndM\n1 dMlc\n=\ndE\ndt\nE0 (t) P (E) dE\nZ \u221e\n= 8\u03c0 2 GM12 m\u2217 Ra(t)\nfi (E)dE,\n(27)\nE0 (t)\n\nwhere M (t) is the mass in stars interacting with the binary and fi (E) is the initial distribution function; setting\nP (E0 ) = t reflects the fact that stars on orbits with periods less than t have already interacted with the binary\nand been ejected. Combining equations (25) and (27),\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\nd 1\n2\n\u2248 24\u03c0 RGm\u2217\nfi (E)dE.\n(28)\ndt a\nE0 (t)\nSolutions to equation (28) show that a binary in a singular isothermal sphere galaxy stalls at ah /a \u2248 2.5 for\nM2 = M1 , compared with ah /a \u2248 10 if the full loss cone\nwere depleted (equation 26). In galaxies with shallower\ncentral cusps, decay of the binary would stall at even\ngreater separations.\nIt is therefore entirely possible that uncoalesced binaries\nexist at the centers of many galaxies, particularly galaxies\nlike large ellipticals with low central densities. But there\nis circumstantial evidence that long-lived black hole binaries are rare. Some radio galaxies show clear evidence of\na recent flip in the black hole's spin orientation, as would\noccur when two black holes coalesce (Dennett-Thorpe et\nal. 2002), and their numbers are consistent with a coalescence rate that is roughly equal to the galaxy merger\nrate (Merritt & Ekers 2002). The almost complete lack of\ncorrelation between jet directions in Seyfert galaxies and\nthe angular momenta of their disks (Ulvestad & Wilson\n1984; Kinney et al. 2000) also suggests that black hole\ncoalescences were common in the past. There are few if\nany \"smoking gun\" detections of binary black holes among\nAGN (e.g. Halpern & Eracleous 2000); the best, but still\ncontroversial, case is OJ 287 (Pursimo et al. 2000).\nBelow are discussed some additional mechanisms that\nhave been proposed for extracting energy from binary\nblack holes and hastening their decay. When the agent interacting with the binary is stars, continued decay of the\nbinary implies continued destruction of the stellar cusp.\nHowever for most of the mechanisms discussed below, the\ndetailed effects on the stellar distribution have yet to be\nworked out.\n4.2.1. Scattering of stars into the loss cone\nDestruction of a pre-existing stellar cusp generates strong\ngradients in the phase-space density at L \u2248 Llc , the angular momentum of an orbit that lies just outside the loss\ncone. A small perturbation can deflect a star on such\nan orbit into the loss cone. This process has been studied in detail in the context of gravitational scattering of\nstars into the tidal disruption sphere of a single black hole\n(Lightman & Shapiro 1977; Cohn & Kulsrud 1978). Once\na steady-state flow of stars into the loss cone has been set\nup, the distribution function near Llc has the form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nR\n1\n(29)\nf (E) ln\nf (E, L) \u2248\nln(1/Rlc )\nRlc\n(Lightman & Shapiro 1977), where R \u2261 L2 /L2c (E), Lc (E)\nis the angular momentum of a circular orbit of energy E,\nand f is the distribution function far from the loss cone,\nassumed to be isotropic. The mass flow into the central\n\n\f7\nR\n\nF (E)dE, where\n\u001b\n\u001aI\nh(\u2206R)2 i\ndr\nf\n2 2\nlim\ndE.\nF (E)dE = 4\u03c0 Lc (E)\nvr R\u21920 2R\nln(1/Rlc )\n(30)\nThe quantity in brackets is the orbit-averaged diffusion\ncoefficient in R. Yu (2002) evaluated the contribution of\ntwo-body scattering to the decay rate of a massive binary\nand found that it was usually too small to overcome the\nstalling that occurs when the loss cone is first emptied.\nStandard loss cone theory as applied by Yu (2002) assumes a quasi-steady-state distribution of stars in phase\nspace near Llc . This assumption is appropriate at the center of a globular cluster, where relaxation times are much\nshorter than the age of the universe, but is less appropriate for a galactic nucleus, where relaxation times almost\nalways greatly exceed a Hubble time (e.g. Faber et al.\n1997). The distribution function f (E, L) immediately following the formation of a hard binary is approximately a\nstep function,\n\u001a\nf (E, L) \u2248 f (E), L > Llc\n(31)\n0,\nL < Llc ,\nobject is m\u2217\n\nmuch steeper than the \u223c ln L dependence in a collisonally\nrelaxed nucleus (equation 29). Since the transport rate\nin phase space is proportional to the gradient of f with\nrespect to L, steep gradients imply an enhanced flux into\nthe loss cone. The total mass in stars consumed by the\nbinary can exceed the predictions of the standard model\nby factors of a few, implying greater cusp destruction and\nmore rapid decay of the binary (Milosavljevic & Merritt\n2003b). This time-dependent loss cone refilling might be\nparticularly effective in a nucleus that that continues to\nexperience mergers or accretion events, in such a way that\nthe loss cone repeatedly returns to an unrelaxed state with\nits associated steep gradients.\n4.2.2. Re-ejection\nUnlike the case of tidal disruption of stars by a single\nblack hole, a star that interacts with a massive binary remains inside the galaxy and is available for further interactions. In principle, a single star can interact many times\nwith the binary before being ejected from the galaxy or\nfalling outside the loss cone; each interaction takes additional energy from the binary and hastens its decay. Consider a simple model in which a group of N stars in a\nspherical galaxy interact with the binary and receive a\nmean energy increment of h\u2206Ei. Let the original energy\nof the stars be E0 . Averaged over a single orbital period\nP (E), the binary hardens at a rate\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN h\u2206Ei\nd GM1 M2\n= m\u2217\n.\n(32)\ndt\n2a\nP (E)\nIn subsequent interactions, the number of stars that remain inside the loss cone scales as L2lc \u221d a while the ejection energy scales as \u223c a\u22121 . Hence N h\u2206Ei \u221d a1 a\u22121 \u221d a0 .\nAssuming the singular isothermal sphere potential for the\ngalaxy, one finds\n\u0014\n\u0015\nah\nm\u2217 N h\u2206Ei t \u2212 th\n\u03bc\nln 1 +\n\u22481+\n(33)\na(t)\nM12\n2\u03bc\u03c3 2\nP (E0 )\n\n(Milosavljevic & Merritt 2003b). Hence the binary's binding energy increases as the logarithm of the time, even\nafter all the stars in the loss cone have interacted at least\nonce with the binary. Re-ejection would occur differently\nin nonspherical galaxies where angular momentum is not\nconserved and ejected stars could miss the binary on their\nsecond passage. However there will generally exist a subset of orbits defined by a maximum pericenter distance\n<\n\u223c a and stars scattered onto such orbits can continue to\ninteract with the binary.\n4.2.3. Chaotic loss cones\nLoss cone dynamics are qualitatively different in nonaxisymmetric (triaxial or bar-like) potentials, since a much\ngreater number of stars may be on \"centrophilic\" orbits\nwhich take them near to the black hole(s) (Gerhard &\nBinney 1985). Triaxial models need to be taken seriously\ngiven recent demonstrations (Poon & Merritt 2002, 2003)\nthat black hole nuclei can be stably triaxial and that the\nfraction of mass on centrophilic \u2013 typically chaotic \u2013 orbits\ncan be large. The frequency of pericenter passages, rperi <\nd, for a chaotic orbit of energy E in a triaxial black-hole\nnuclus is roughly linear in d, N (rperi < d) \u2248 d \u00d7 A(E)\n(Merritt & Poon 2003). The total rate at which stars pass\nwithin a distance Ra of the massive binary is therefore\nZ\ndM\n\u2248 Ra A(E)Mc (E)dE\n(34)\ndt\nwhere Mc (E) is the mass on centrophilic orbits. The implied feeding rate can be comparable to that in a spherical\nnucleus with a constantly-refilled loss cone, and orders of\nmagnitude greater than in a loss cone that is re-supplied\nvia star-star interactions (Merritt & Poon 2003). Even\ntransient departures from axisymmetry, for instance during mergers, might result in substantial loss cone refilling\ndue to this mechanism.\n4.2.4. Multiple black holes\nIf binary decay stalls, an uncoalesced binary may be\npresent in a nucleus when a third black hole, or a second\nbinary, is deposited there following a subsequent merger.\nThe multiple black hole system that forms will engage\nin its own gravitational slingshot interactions, eventually\nejecting one or more of the black holes from the nucleus\n(though probably not from the galaxy). This process has\nbeen extensively modelled assuming a fixed potential for\nthe galaxy (e.g. Valtaoja, Valtonen & Byrd 1989; Mikkola\n& Valtonen 1990; Valtonen et al. 1994). The effect on\nthe stellar distribution of N >\n\u223c 2, interacting black holes\nis not well understood, though N -body simulations with\n10 \u2212 20 massive particles and a \"live\" background show\nthat the black holes displace \u223c 10 times their own mass\nbefore being ejected (Merritt & Milosavljevic 2003). The\nseparation and eccentricity of the dominant binary can\nchange dramatically during each interaction and this may\nbe an effective way to shorten the gravity wave coalescence\ntime. In a wide, hierarchical triple, the eccentricity of the\ndominant\nbinary oscillates through\na maximum value of\np\np\n\u223c 1 \u2212 5 cos2 i/3, | cos i| < 3/5, with i the mutual inclination angle (Kozai 1962). Blaes, Lee & Socrates (2002)\nestimate that the coalescence times in equal-mass, hierarchical triples can be reduced by factors of \u223c 10 via the\nKozai mechanism.\n\n\f8\n4.2.5. Gas dynamics\nIf the inner \u223c 1 pc of the nucleus contains a mass in\ngas comparable to M2 , torques from the gas will cause the\norbit of the smaller black hole to decay in a time of order the gas accretion time (Syer & Clarke 1995; Ivanov,\nPapaloizou & Polnarev 1999). Given standard assumptions about accretion disk viscosities, the gas-dynamical\ndecay rate would exceed that from gravity wave emission\nfor a > aacc , where\n\u0010 p \u00112/5\naacc\n\u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u22123\nah\n0.1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\n200 km s\u22121\n\n\u00132\n\n(35)\n\n(Armitage & Natarajan 2002). If the orbit of the secondary is strongly inclined with respect to the accretion\ndisk around the larger black hole, its passages through the\ndisk could generate periodic outbursts, and this has been\nsuggested as a model for the \u223c 12 yr cycle of optical flaring\nobserved in the blazar OJ 287 (Lehto & Valtonen 1996).\nGas deposition of the required magnitude almost certainly\noccurred during the quasar epoch, although it is less clear\nthat this mechanism is effective for galaxies in the current\nuniverse.\n5. N -BODY STUDIES\n\nUnless great care is taken, N -body studies of binary\nblack hole dynamics are unlikely to give an accurate picture of the evolution expected in real galaxies. This follows\nfrom the result (\u00a7 4.2) that time scales for two-body scattering of stars into the binary's loss cone are of order the\nHubble time or somewhat longer in real galaxies. In N body simulations, relaxation times are shorter by factors\nof \u223c N/1011 than in real galaxies, hence the long-term evolution of the binary is likely to be dominated by spurious\nloss cone refilling, Brownian motion of the black holes and\nother noise-driven effects (Milosavljevic & Merritt 2003b).\nThe stalling that is predicted in the absence of loss cone\nrefilling in real galaxies (Figure 4) can only be reproduced\nvia N -body codes if the mean field is artificially smoothed\nand the black hole binary is \"nailed down\" (e.g. Quinlan\n& Hernquist 1997).\nN -body studies are most useful at characterizing the\nearly stages of binary formation and decay, or simulating\nthe disruptive effects of a single black hole on an infalling\ngalaxy; indeed scattering experiments (\u00a7 4.1) are almost\nuseless in these regimes. Due to algorithmic limitations,\nmost N -body studies (e.g. Ebisuzaki, Makino & Okumura\n1991; Makino et al. 1993; Governato, Colpi & Maraschi\n1994; Makino & Ebisuzaki 1996; Makino 1997; Nakano\n& Makino 1999a,b; Hemsendorf, Sigurdsson & Spurzem\n2002) have been based on galaxy models with unrealistically large cores. N -body merger simulations using realistically dense initial conditions (Holley-Bockelmann &\nRichstone 2000; Merritt & Cruz 2001; Merritt et al. 2002)\nshow that the black hole in the larger galaxy is efficient\nat tidally disrupting the steep cusp in the infalling galaxy,\nproducing a remnant with only slightly higher central density than that of the giant galaxy initially. This result\nhelps explain the absence of dense cusps in bright galaxies (Forbes, Franx & Illingworth 1995) and the persistence\nof the \"core fundamental plane\" in the face of mergers\n(Holley-Bockelmann & Richstone 1999).\n\nQuinlan & Hernquist (1997) studied the evolution of a\nblack hole binary inside cuspy models with \u03c1 \u223c r\u22121 and\n\u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 and a range of black hole masses and particle\nnumbers, N \u2264 2 \u00d7 105 . Their N -body code was unable to\nsimulate an actual merger and all of their detailed results\nwere derived from initial conditions consisting of a single galaxy into which two \"naked\" black holes were symmetrically dropped. This artificial starting configuration\nproduced substantial evolution of the cusp before the formation of the binary. The late evolution of the binary\nwas found to be strongly dependent on N , due in part\nto spurious Brownian motion of the black hole particles.\nThe cores that formed were characterized by strong velocity anisotropies, \u03c3t \u226b \u03c3r , due to the ejection of stars on\neccentric orbits.\nMilosavljevic & Merritt (2001) followed the evolution\nof cuspy (\u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 ) galaxy models containing black holes,\nstarting from pre-merger initial conditions and continuing\nuntil the binary separation had decayed a factor of \u223c 10\nbelow ah . The initially steep nuclear cusps were converted\nto shallower, \u03c1 \u223c r\u22121 profiles shortly after the black holes\nhad formed a hard binary; thereafter the nuclear profile\nevolved slowly toward shallower slopes. The decay rate of\nthe binary was found not to be strongly dependent on N ,\nprobably due to the fact that the loss cone was continuously refilled by two-body scattering in their collisional\nsimulation (Milosavljevic & Merritt 2003b). The velocity anisotropies created during formation of the core were\nmuch milder than in the simulations of Quinlan & Hernquist (1997), similar in magnitude to the anisotropies predicted by the adiabatic growth model (Figure 1).\nAn N -body test of the time-dependent loss cone dynamics described in \u00a74.2 would be possible using a collisional\n7\ncode with N >\n\u223c 10 (Milosavljevic & Merritt 2003b). Such\nlarge particle numbers demand a novel N -body algorithm\ncoupled with special-purpose hardware like the GRAPE-6.\n6. OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE FOR THE BINARY BLACK\nHOLE MODEL\n\nFigure 3 shows that a massive binary must eject of order\nits own mass in reaching a separation of agr if M2 \u2248 M1 ,\nor several times M2 if M2 \u226a M1 . These numbers should\nbe interpreted with caution since: (1) binaries might not\ndecay as far as agr , or the final stages of decay might be\ndriven by some process other than energy exchange with\nstars; (2) the definition of \"ejection\" used in Figure 3 is\nescape of a star from an isolated binary, and does not\ntake into account the confining effect of the nuclear potential; (3) the effect of repeated mergers on nuclear density profiles, particularly mergers involving very unequalmass binaries, is poorly understood. Nevertheless, a clear\nprediction of the binary black hole model is that galactic\nmergers should result in the removal of a mass of order\nM12 from the nucleus. As in the adiabatic growth model,\nwe are handicapped in testing the theory by lack of knowledge of the primordial nuclear profiles. A reasonable guess\nis that all galaxies originally had steep, \u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 density\ncusps, since these are generic in the low-luminosity ellipticals which are least likely to have been influenced by\nmergers, and since the adiabatic growth model predicts\n\u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 (Figure 1).\nThe \"mass deficit\" is defined as the difference in integrated mass between the observed density profile, and a\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 4.- Mass deficit versus black hole mass for three different assumed values of \u03b30 , the logarithmic slope of the density cusp before\nenergy input from the black holes. (a) \u03b30 = 2; (b) \u03b30 = 1.75; (c) \u03b30 = 1.5. Units are solar masses. Solid lines are Mdef = M\u2022 (Milosavljevic\net al. 2002).\n\n\u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 profile extrapolated inward from the break radius\nrb :\n#\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b30\nZ rb \"\nr\n\u03c1(rb )\nMdef \u2261 4\u03c0\n\u2212 \u03c1(r) r2 dr.\n(36)\nrb\n0\nMilosavljevic et al. (2002) and Ravindranath, Ho & Filippenko (2002) computed Mdef in samples of \"core\"-profile\nelliptical galaxies. The former authors found a good proportionality between Mdef and M\u2022 , with hMdef /M\u2022 i \u2248 1\nfor \u03b30 = 1.5 and hMdef /M\u2022 i \u2248 10 for \u03b30 = 2 (Figure 4). These numbers are within the range predicted by\nthe binary black hole model, given the uncertainties associated with the effects of multiple mergers. Ravindranath,\nHo & Filippenko (2001) computed black hole masses using a shallower assumed slope for the M\u2022 \u2212 \u03c3 relation,\nM\u2022 \u221d \u03c3 3.75 , and found a steeper, nonlinear dependence of\nMdef on M\u2022 .\nMore rigorous tests of the binary black hole model will\nrequire a better understanding of the expected form of\n\u03c1(r). As discussed above, while the best current N -body\nsimulations suggest \u03c1 \u223c r\u22121 following binary formation\n(Milosavljevic & Merritt 2001), the simulations are dominated by noise over the long term. If the decay stalls, the\npredicted density profile can be very different: a \"hole\"\nforms inside of \u223c 3astall (e.g. Figure 1 of Zier & Biermann 2001). Central minima may in fact have been seen\nin the luminosity profiles of a few galaxies (Lauer et al.\n2002).\nOther processes could result in energy exchange between\nbinary black holes and stars. If the binary eventually\ncoalesces, the gravitational radiation carries a linear momentum leading to a recoil of the coalesced black hole at\na velocity vrecoil \u223c 102 \u2212 103 km s\u22121 (Bekenstein 1973;\nFitchett 1983; Eardley 1983), and possibly even higher if\nthe black holes were rapidly spinning prior to coalescence\n(Redmount & Rees 1989). Recoil velocities of this order\nwould eject the black hole from the center of the nucleus\nand its subsequent infall would displace stars. Quantitative evaluation of this effect will require more accurate\nestimates of vrecoil based on fully general-relativistic cal-\n\nculations of black hole coalescence.\nEquating Mdef with the mass removed by the binary\nblack hole is only justified if galaxy mergers leave nuclear\ndensity profiles nearly unchanged in the absence of the\ngravitational slingshot. This is known to be the case in\nequal-mass mergers between galaxies with power-law cusps\n(Barnes 1999; Milosavljevic & Merritt 2001), though less\nis known about the effects of unequal-mass mergers. It is\ndifficult to see how the break radii in galaxies with rb \u226b rh\n(e.g. NGC 3640, 4168) can be accounted for by the binary\nblack hole model unless mergers sometimes induce changes\nin \u03c1(r) well beyond the radius of influence of the black\nholes.\nAnother unsolved problem is the persistence of steep,\n\u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 nuclear profiles in fainter galaxies; even these\ngalaxies should have undergone at least one merger since\ntheir formation. One possibility is that faint ellipticals experienced their last major merger at a time when spheroids\ncontained a much larger gas fraction than at present (e.g.\nKauffmann & Haehnelt 2000), and that binary decay was\ndriven by gas dynamics during this last merger.\nA major focus of future work should be to calculate the\nevolution of \u03c1(r) as predicted by the various scenarios for\nbinary decay discussed in this article.\n\nAn abridged version of this article will appear in Carnegie\nObservatories Astrophysics Series, Vol. 1: \"Coevolution\nof Black Holes and Galaxies,\" edited by L.
