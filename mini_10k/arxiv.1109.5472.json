the\n\narXiv:1109.5472v1 [math.RT] 26 Sep 2011\n\nMonotonicity Conjecture of Merris and Watkins\nby Avital Frumkin\nabstruct\nWe show that the monotonicity conjecture of Merriss and Watkins is\ntrue in average when taking the set of matrices of given non negative\nspectra as probability space with respect to the Haar measure of the\nunitarian group .\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet CSn be the group algebra of the symmetric group Sn over the complex numbers. ,CSn includes all the functions from Sn to C as vector\nspace of dimension N! . The multiplication is defined as convolution of\ngroup's functions , i.e.\nf * g(\u03c3) =\n\nX\n\nf (\u03b3) g(\u03b3 \u22121\u03c3)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b3\u2208Sn\n\nGiven n \u00d7 n complex matrix A, we define a function from CSn to C by\nthe formula\nf \u2208 CSn\n\nf \u2192 df (A) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sn\n\nf (\u03c3)\n\nY\n\nAi\n\n\u03c3(i)\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\n( d is for \"determinant\")\nIn these notations, the determinant of a matrix A is given by the formula\ndetA = df (A), f : Sn \u2192 C, f (\u03c3) = sig(\u03c3).\n\n(3)\n\nThe permanent of A is\ndf (A), f : Sn \u2192 C, f (\u03c3) = 1.f orany\u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fFor given irreducible character\u03c7 of Sn ,after identifying it as a function from CSN to the complexes d\u03c7 (A) is called the immanent of A\ncorresponding with \u03c7.\na partition of N is a vector of integers \u03b7 = \u03b71 , \u03b72 * * * so that \u03b71 \u2265\nP\n\u03b72 * * * \u2265 0 and\n\u03b71 = N. We denote \u03b7 A partition of N by \u03b7 \u22a2 N.\nThe irreducible characters of SN correspond to partitions of N,\n\nhence each irreducible character is attached to a partition, . So we\ndenote d\u03b7 (A) instead of d\u03c7\u03b7 (A).\nThe first theorem in the area of immanents is that of Schur in 1918\n. One corollary of it is that\ndet(A) \u2264\n\nd\u03b7 (A)\n\u03c7(e)\n\n(5)\n\nto any n \u00d7 n Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix A and \u03b7 \u22a2 n once\ne is the trivial element of Sn .\nIn my view,even the fact that d\u03b7 (A) is non-negative to any nonnegative definite matrix A and \u03b7 \u22a2 n is amazing.\nThe word immanent, apparently invented by Littlewood,to these\ncomplex functions involving Sn group algebra and n \u00d7 n matrices over\nC. See Chapter (6) in his book The Theory of Group Character [Li].\nLittlewood includes in his definition of immanent almost any monomials in the n \u00d7 n matrices elements in his celebrated postulate about\nthe relationships between immanents and Schur functions. Here is the\npostulate \".... corresponding to any relation between Schur functions\nof total weight N, we may replace the Schur function by the corresponding immanents of complementary coaxial minor of [ast ] provided\nthat every product is summed for all sets of complementary coaxial\nminors.\"\nThis postulate, together with Lieb's inequality [Li], is the corner\nstone of the paper of Merris and Watkins [M W]. In their paper, they\n\n2\n\n\fused it in innovative way accomplishing inequalities and identities of\nimmanents and matrix functions\nAmong other things, they raised a conjecture which was called afterwards by Pate [P3] the Merris and Watkins (monotonicity) conjecture\n. For treating it, we need some definitions.\nFor a given partition of N, \u03b7 = \u03b71 \u2265 \u03b72 \u2265 \u03b7n \u2265 0. The \u03b7 \u2032 s weight\nspace of \u2297N Cn is spent by all the tensors vi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN for which the\nnumber of occurrences of vj , i.e. the j basis vector of Cn , is \u03b7j . The\nweight spaces in \u2297N Cn are SN module with respect to the Schur action\nof SN on \u2297N Cn : for \u03c3 \u2208 Sn its Schur action is defined by the formula\n\u03c3(vi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN ) = vi\u03c3 (1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 vi\u03c3 (N )\n\n(6)\n\n. The SN 's character corresponding with this \u03b7 weight space is\ndenoted [\u03b7] in [M W]\nIn the language of character theory, [\u03b7] is the induce character from\nthe trivial character of the Young sub group corresponding with \u03b7 see\n[J K ]to SN\nThe dominant order on the set of partitions of N \u227b,is defined by the\nformula\n\u2032\n\n\u03b7\u227b\u03b7 \u21d4\n\nj\nX\n\n\u03b7i \u2265\n\nj\nX\n\n\u03b7i\u2032\n\nto any j\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nThis order between partitions of N has an intimate connection to\nthe action of the Lie algebra gln (C) on \u2297N Cn and through it with the\naction of GLn (C) on \u2297N Cn .\nBy using a clever result in representation theory of symmetric groups\n( theorem 22 of [JK])(among other results), Merris and Watkins proved\nthat for any non-negative definite n \u00d7 n matrix A\n\u03b7 \u227b \u03b7 \u2032 \u21d2 d[\u03b7] A \u2264 d[\u03b7\u2032 ] A\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fOn the other hand , they conjectured (God know how )that\nn\n\n!\u22121\n\nn\n\n!\u22121\n\nn\n\n!\n\nd[\u03b7\u2032 ] A .\nis the multinomial coefd[\u03b7] A \u2265\n\u03b7\n\u03b1\n\u03b7\u2032\nficient attached\n! to the partition \u03b1.\nN\nn\nClearly\nis the dimension of the \u03b1\u2032 s weight space in n C.\n\u03b1\nWe shall prove (theorem 7)that when \u03b7 \u0017 \u03b7 \u2032\nn\n\n!\u22121\n\nR\n\nd[\u03b7\u2032 ] Au du \u2265\n\nn\n\u2032\n\n!\u22121\n\nR\n\nd[\u03b7\u2032 ] Au du. when Au = uAu\u22121 and\n\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nthe integration is done over the Unitarian group Un with respect to the\nHaar measure du of Un .\nWhen n tends to infinity, and \u03b7 is a partition of n of a bounded\nnumber of parts, the character[\u03b7]\ntends to be closer to \u03c7\u03b7 , the irreducible character corresponding\nwith \u03b7, in a reasonable matric.More precisely when [\u03b7] is written as sum\nof ireduceabl characters the contribution of those characters far from\n\u03c7\u03b7 to the dimension of [\u03b7] vanishes in comparison to the full dimension.\nSee [F.G] or [M.H.Ch]( under the tittle Kyel Werner theorem)\nBecause of that and the fact that the induce characters are easier\nthan the irreducible one to compute, the asymptotic behavior of them\nis worth attention when looking for counter examples.Indeed this is\nhow I got to consider them . Hence before turning to the Merris and\nWotkins monotonicity conjecture in average , we survey the monotonicity of immanents' status as I know it\nI believe that the next theorem of Pate cover the scope till now\nGiven a partition \u03b7 = \u03b71 \u2265 \u03b72 \u2265 * * * \u03b7i > \u03b7i+1 * * * let \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b71 \u2265 \u03b72 \u2265\n* * * \u03b7i \u2212 1 \u2265 \u03b7i+1 * * * \u2265 1 \u21d2\n\nd\u03b7\u2032 (A)\n\u03c7\u03b7\u2032 (e)\n\n\u2264\n\nd\u03b7 (A)\n.\n\u03c7\u03b7 (e)\n\nThat is to say that in removing a corner in the Young diagram of shape\n4\n\n\f\u03b7 to the end decreases the normalized immanent corresponding with\nthe new partition.See [P2] , The first large step in this direction was\ndone in [P 1]\nOur approach to computations of the Sn matrix function begins\nwith an observation that appeared in [Kos] where Kostant reproved\nthat\nd\u03b7 (A) > d\u03b7 (I) for non-negative definite, or totally positive matrices,A of determinant 1 .\nHis observation is that d\u03b7 (A) is the \"trace\" of A\u2297n when it acts on\nM\u03b7 (0). The zero weight subspace of M\u03b7 where M\u03b7 is the irreducible\nGLn (C) module corresponding with \u03b7. The zero weight space is the\nsubspace of all the Tori invariant vectors. In other words the subspace\nof the equipartition weight . The parenthesis over the trace was needed\nsince M\u03b7 (0) is not respected by A\u2297n for a general matrix A and some\nprojection is needed. But by averaging the immanent of uAu\u2217 over the\nUnitarian group with respect to its Haar measure , the projection, can\nbe ignored\nGiven f \u2208 CSN we denote d\u02c6f (A) =\n\nR\n\ndf (Au )du integrated over the\n\nunitarian group with respect to the Haar measure\nLet us denote d\u02c6\u03b7 (A) for d\u02c6\u03c7\u03b7 (A) . We shall prove (theorem 5)\nd\u02c6\u03b7 (A) = trace\n\nZ\n\nAu\u2297n du\n\nM\u03b7(0)\n\n=\n\ns\u03b7 (A)\ndim( M\u03b7 (0))\ns\u03b7 (I)\n\n(9)\n\nBy s\u03b7 (A) we mean the value of the Schur function corresponding with\n\u03b7 under substitution of the spectra of A. An important fact is that\ndim M\u03b7 (0) = \u03c7\u03b7 (e), i.e., the dimension of the Sn irreducible module\ncorresponding with \u03b7. See [Kos]or lemma 5.\nIt is worth attention that formula 9 for d\u02c6\u03b7 (A) is the expected con-\n\n5\n\n\ftribution of a random subspace M\u03b7 (0)\nto the trace of a random operator when acts on a whole space M\u03b7 ,\nwhen using an orthogonal form to compute the trace.i e this is the\nmost likely number one wold evaluate d\u03b7 (A)to A of given spectra Hence\nthrough the monotonicity theorem we have proof the Merris Watkin\nmonotonicity conjecture is definitely supported since the averaging values we compute are seemed to be generic .\none can naturally ask about averaging over the Orthogonal group in\nplace of the Unitarian group. The answer is quite complicated since\nA\u2297n usually even doesn't respect the irreducible modules of the Orthogonal group So first of all the problem has to be defined more delicately\n. Next one has to challenge the difficulties which the Brower algebra\nproduces . Hopefully it will be treated elsewhere\nNow the identity 9 enables us to prove(lemma 7) that for any Sn\u2032 s\nR\nsubmodule V \u2286 \u2297n Cn , d\u02c6\u03c7 (A) = trace( Au \u2297n ) |V\nV\n\nwhere \u03c7V is the character of Sn action on V. The trace is defined\n\nsince such integrals respect Sn 's submodule.After this is done , to prove\nthe averaging version of Merris and Watkins conjecture is a matter of\nsome explicit traces computations.(theorem 7)\nSections 2,3,4 can be thought of as preliminaries in representation\ntheory relevant to our treatment afterwards . Sections 5,6 deal with\nspecial central element operators on \u2297n Cn given by integrations over\nthe Unitarian group. In Section 7 we prove the monotonicity result.\nOur treatment doesn't use any explicit integration over the unitarian group .On the contrary , in section 8 we bring a formula for the\naverage of multiplicity-free products of matrix-elements, in terms of\nSchur-functions and characters of the symmetric group. The average\nis being taken over the unitarian group with respect to its action by\nconjugation on the matrix (theorem 9).\n\n6\n\n\f2.\n\nThe tensor space \u2297N Cn\n\nas SN (Un)\n\nmodule\n\nLet v1 , v2 * * * vm be an orthonormal basis. Denote the form by h i.\nGiven N we extend the form to \u2297N Cn by the formula\nY\nhvi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN * vj1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vjN i =\nhvik vjk i\n\n(10)\n\nk\n\nDefine the Schur action of the symmetric group SN on \u2297N Cn by the\nformula\n\u03c3(vi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN ) = vi\u03c3\u22121 (1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 vi\u03c3\u22121 (N)\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 SN\n\n(11)\n\nFor a given n \u00d7 n matrix A, define the diagonal action of A on \u2297N Cn\nby the formula\nA(vi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN ) = Avi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 AviN\n\n(12)\n\nSome times we call the operator coresponding with A\" the N Kronecker\nN\n\npower of A\" and denote it by A\n\nN\n\nA monotonic vector of integers \u03b7\u0304 = \u03b71 \u2265 \u03b72 \u2265 * * * \u03b7N is called a\npartition of N ; \u03b7 \u22a2 N if \u03a3\u03b7i = N.\nFor \u03b7 \u22a2 N define the \u03b7 weight space in \u2297N Cn ; \u2297N Cn (\u03b7) by the formula\n\u2297N Cn (\u03b7) = span[vi1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 viN ; #[e : ie = j] = \u03b7j ]\n\n(13)\n\nFor a subspace M of \u2297N Cn we define\nM(\u03b7) = M \u2229 \u2297N Cn (\u03b7) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe weight space of \u03b7\u0304 = \u03b71 = \u03b72 = \u03b73 * * * is called the zero weight\nspace ; M(0). In this note usually N=n so \u03b7i = 1 in the last definition\nto zero weight spaces .\n7\n\n\fNow as it can easily be seen, the action of the symmetric group\n(11) and that of the Unitarian group(12) on the tensor product spaces\ncommute with each other so they respect the isotypical (see section 3)\ncomponent of one another . In fact they have an isotypical component\nin common in their action on \u2297N Cn\n\n.So it is enough to treat just\n\nthe isotypical component of the symmetric group.\nbecause of the irreducible representations ofSN indexed by partitions\nof N it is reasonable to denote the isotypical components ofSN (Un )\nin\u2297N Cn with partitions of N and identify such a component with V\u03b7 \u2297\nM\u03b7 where V\u03b7 is SN irreducible and M\u03b7 is Un irreducible.\nThe Schur Wyel duality theorem shows this relationships between Sn\nand Un representations on the tensor product spaces.\nTheorem 1.

Given irreducible character \u03c7, C\u03c7 is idempotent and\nCG * C\u03c7 is the isotypical component of \u2297N Cn corresponding with \u03c7.\nTo prove this one use the orthogonality relations of the irreducible\ncharacters of a finite group. See [J.K].\nFor our treatment we formulate it more generally in the next lemma\nLemma 2. Let M be a G\u2032 s module over C and \u03c7 be an irreducible\ncharacter of G. Then MC\u03c7 is the isotypical component of M corresponding with \u03c7.\n.\nAlong this note we exchange freely GLn (C) with the unitarian group\nUn thanks to the next statement.\nLemma 3. Each irreducible GLn (C) module remains irreducible under\nreduction to the unitarian group Un and vice versa, i.e. each Un 's irreducible module occurs as a reduction from GLn (C) irreducible module\nSee [GW] page 94.\nBy \" isotypical component\" (of a module) we mean a maximal\nsubmodule with no non isomorphic submodules in it. The importance\nof the isotypical component a module is that intertwining operators i e\noperators which commute with the action of the group on the module\nrespect it\n\"complete reducibility\"is cleared by the next theorem\nTheorem 2.

The explicit construction of \u03c7\u03b7 is not needed for our\ntreatment . A good reference for characters \u03c7\u03b7 and their irreducible\nmodule V\u03b7 , is [J.K] or [G W].\nLet \u03b7 \u22a2 N, \u03b7 = \u03b71 \u2265 \u03b7n * * * \u2265 \u03b7n . For our discussion any \u03b7 \u22a2 N is\nno more than n part.

See the figure below.\nGiven N, a Young's tableaux of shape \u03b7 \u22a2 N is a filling of the cells\nof the Young's diagram by the numbers 1, 2 * * * n so they increase down\nthe column and non-decrease in the rows to the right.\nNext corresponding to partition \u03b7 \u22a2 N of no more than n parts we\nconstruct a basis for an irreducible Un module in \u2297N Cn\nGiven Young tableaux of shape \u03b7, we construct a vector in \u2297N Cn by\nthe next process.
