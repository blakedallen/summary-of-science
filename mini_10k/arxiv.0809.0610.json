In brief, a given set of customers\nhas to be served with vehicles from a depot such that a particular criterion is optimized. The most\ncomprehensive model therefore consists of a complete graph G = (V, A), where V = {v0 , v1 , . . . , vn }\ndenotes a set of vertices and A = {(vi , vj ) | vi , vj \u2208 V, i 6= j} denotes the connecting arcs. The\ndepot is represented by v0 , and m vehicles are stationed at this location to service the customers\nvi , . . . , vn . Each customer vi demands a nonnegative quantity qi of goods and service results in a\nnonnegative service time di . Traveling on a connecting arc (vi , vj ) results in a cost cij or travel time\ntij . The most basic vehicle routing problem aims to identify a solutions that serves all customers,\nnot exceeding the maximum capacity of the vehicles Qk and their maximum travel time Tk while\nminimizing the total distances/costs of the routes.\nVarious extensions have been proposed to this general problem type. Most of them introduce\nadditional constraints to the problem domain such as time windows, defining for each customer\nvi an interval [ei , li ] of service. While arrival before ei results in a waiting time, arrival after li is\n\u2217\n\nLehrstuhl f\u00fcr Industriebetriebslehre, Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim, 70593 Stuttgart, Germany\nEmail: {mjgeiger|w-wenger}@uni-hohenheim.de\n\n1\n\n\fusually considered to be infeasible [9]. In other approaches, the times windows may be violated,\nleading to a tardy service at some customers [3].\nSome problems introduce multiple depots as opposed to only a single depot in the classical case.\nAlong with this sometimes comes the additional decision of open routes, where vehicles do not\nreturn to the place they depart from but to some other depot. Also, different types of vehicles may\nbe considered, leading to a heterogeneous fleet in terms of the abilities of the vehicles.\nUnfortunately, most problems of this domain are N P-hard. As a result, heuristics and more recently\nmetaheuristics have been developed with increasing success [5]. In order to improve known results,\nmore and more refined techniques have been proposed that are able to solve, or at least approximate\nvery closely, a large number of established benchmark instances. With the increasing specialization\nof techniques goes however a decrease in generality of the resolution approaches.\nWhile the optimality criterion of minimizing the total traveled distances is the most common,\nmore recent approaches recognize the vehicle routing problem as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem [4, 6\u20138]. Here, the overall problem lies in identifying a Pareto-optimal solution x\u2217 that\nis most preferred by a decision maker. As the relevant objective functions are often of conflicting\nnature, a whole set of potential Pareto-optimal solutions exists among which this choice has to be\nmade.\nIn the current article, a framework for interactive multi-objective vehicle routing is presented that\naims to address two critical issues: (i) the necessary generality of resolution approaches when trying\nto solve a range of problems of different characteristics, and (ii) the integration of multiple objectives\nin the resolution process.\n\n2\n\nA framework for interactive multi-objective vehicle routing\n\nIndependent from the precise characteristics of the particular VRP, two types of decisions have to\nbe made when solving the problem.\n1. Assignment of customers to vehicles (clustering).\n2. Construction of a route for a given set of customers (sequencing).\nIt is well-known that both types of decisions influence each other to a considerable extent. The\nhere presented framework therefore proposes the use of a set of elements to handle this issue with\nupmost generality. Figure 1 gives an overview about the elements used.\n\u2013 The marketplace represents the element where orders are offered for transportation.\n\u2013 Vehicle agents place bids for orders on the marketplace. These bids take into consideration\nthe current routes of the vehicles and the potential change when integrating an additional\norder.\n\u2013 An ontology describes the precise properties of the vehicles such as their capacity, availability,\ncurrent location, etc. This easily allows the consideration of different types of vehicles.\n2\n\n\fhuman\ndecision\nmaker\npreferences\nGUI\ndecider\n\nvehicle agent\n\nmarketplace\n\nvehicle agent\n\nvehicle agent\n\nvehicle agent\n\nontology\n\nFigure 1: Sketch of the framework\n\n\u2013 A decider communicates with the human decision maker via a graphical user interface (GUI)\nand stores his/her individual preferences. The decider also assigns orders to vehicles, taking\ninto consideration the bids placed for the specific orders.\nA solutions is constructed by placing the orders on the marketplace, collecting bids from the vehicle\nagents, and assigning orders to vehicles while constantly updating the bids. Route construction by\nthe vehicle agents is done in parallel using local search heuristics so that a route can be identified\nthat maximizes the preferences of the decision maker.\n\n3\n\nImplementation and preliminary experiments\n\nThe framework has been prototypically implemented in a computer system. In the first experiments,\ntwo objective functions are considered, the total traveled distances DIST and the total tardiness\nT ARDY caused by vehicles arriving after the upper bound li of the time window.\nThe preferences of the decision maker are represented introducing a weighted sum of both objective\nfunctions. Using the relative importance of the distances wDIST , the overall utility UTILITY of a\nparticular solution can be computed as given in Expression 1.\nU T ILIT Y = wDIST DIST + (1 \u2212 wDIST ) T ARDY\n\n(1)\n\nThe vehicle agents are able to modify the sequence of their orders using four different local search\n3\n\n\fneighborhoods.\n\u2013 Inverting the sequence of the orders between positions p1 and p2 . While this may be beneficial\nwith respect to the distances, it may pose a problem for the time windows as usually orders\nare served in the sequence of their time windows.\n\u2013 Exchanging the positions p1 and p2 of two orders.\n\u2013 Moving an order from position p1 and reinserting it at position p2 , p1 < p2 (forward shift).\n\u2013 Moving an order from position p1 and reinserting it at position p2 , p1 > p2 (backward shift).\nIn each step of the local search procedure, a neighborhood is randomly picked from the set of\nneighborhoods and a move is computed and accepted given an improvement.\nBids for orders on the marketplace are generated by the vehicle agents, taking into consideration all\npossible insertion points in the current route. The sum of the weighted increase in distance DIST\nand tardiness TARDY gives the prize for the order.\nThe decider assigns orders to vehicles such that the maximum regret when not assigning the order\nto a particular vehicle, and therefore having to assign it to some other vehicle, is minimized. It also\nanalyzes the progress of the improvement procedures. Given no improvement for a certain number\nof iterations, the decider forces the vehicle agents to place back orders on the market such that they\nmay be reallocated.\nThe optimization framework has been tested on a benchmark instance taken from [1]. The instance\ncomprises 48 customers that have to be served from 4 depots, each of which possesses two vehicles.\nWe simulated a decision maker changing the relative importance wDIST during the optimization\nprocedure. First, a decision maker starting with a wDIST = 1 and successively decreasing it to 0,\nsecond a decision maker starting with a wDIST = 0 and increasing it to 1, and third a decision maker\nstarting with a wDIST = 0.5, increasing it to 1 and decreasing it again to 0. Between adjusting\nthe values of wDIST in steps of 0.1, enough time for computations has been given to the system to\nallow a convergence to (at least) a local optimum. Figure 2 plots the results obtained during the\ntest runs.\nThe first decision maker starts with DIST = 975, T ARDY = 6246 and moves to DIST = 1412,\nT ARDY = 0 while the second starts with DIST = 2953, T ARDY = 0 and moves to DIST = 1326,\nT ARDY = 3654. Clearly, the first strategy outperforms the second. While an initial value of\nwDIST = 0 allows the identification of a solution with zero tardiness, it tends to construct routes\nthat, when decreasing the relative importance of the tardiness, turn out to be hard to adapt. In\ncomparison to the strategy starting with a wDIST = 1, the clustering of orders turns out the be\nprohibitive for a later improvement.\nWhen comparing the third strategy of starting with a wDIST = 0.5, it becomes obvious that\nthis outperforms both other ways of interacting with the system. Here, the solutions start with\nDIST = 1245, T ARDY = 63, go to DIST = 946, T ARDY = 4342, and finally to DIST = 1335,\nT ARDY = 0. Apparently, starting with a compromise solution is beneficial even for both extreme\nvalues of DIST and T ARDY .\n\n4\n\n\f10000\n\n1 to 0\n0 to 1\n0.5 to 1 to 0\n\ntotal tardiness\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n2000\ndistance\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nFigure 2: Results of the test runs\n\n4\n\nSummary and further development\n\nA framework for the interactive resolution of multi-objective vehicle routing problems has been\npresented. The concept has been prototypically implemented in a computer system. Preliminary\nresults on a benchmark instance have been reported.\nFirst investigations indicate that the concept may successfully solve vehicle routing problems under\nmultiple objectives and complex side constraints. In this context, an interaction with the system is\nprovided by a graphical user interface. The relative importance of the objective functions can be\nmodified by means of a slider bar, resulting in different solutions which are computed in real time\nby the system, therefore providing an immediate feedback to the user. Figure 3 shows two extreme\nsolutions that have been interactively obtained by the system.\nFuture developments are manifold. First, other ways of representing preferences than a weighted\nsum approach may be beneficial to investigate. While the comparable easy interaction with the\nGUI by means of a slider bar enables the user to directly change the relative importance of the\nobjective functions, it prohibits the definition of more complex preference information, e. g. involving\naspiration levels.\nSecond, different and improved ways of implementing the market mechanism have to be investigated.\nFirst results indicate that the quality of the solutions is biased with respect to the initial setting\nof the relative importance of the optimality criteria. It appears as if more complex reallocations of\norders between vehicles are needed to address this issue.\nFinally, more investigations on benchmark instances will be carried out. Apart from test cases known\nfrom literature we aim to address particularly problems with unusual, complex side constraints and\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Two screenshots of the graphical user interface.

An additional use of the system will be the resolution of dynamic VRPs. The\nmarket mechanism provides a platform for the matching of offers to vehicles without the immediate\nneed of accepting them, yet still obtaining feasible solutions and gathering a prize for acceptance of\noffers which may be reported back to the customer.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.-F.
