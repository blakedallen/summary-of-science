It appears as a typical long burst\n[4], with a simple profile and a duration of \u2248 40 s. The burst fluence in the\n20 \u2212 200 keV band is (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 erg/cm2 [4], and the measured redshift\nis z = 0.106 [5]. We analyze in the following the gamma-ray signal received\nby INTEGRAL.\nSuch observations find a direct explanation in our theoretical model [6]. We\ndetermine the values of its two free parameters: the total energy stored in the\nDyadosphere Edya and the mass of the baryons left by the collapse MB c2 =\nBEdya . We follow the expansion of the pulse, composed by the e\u2212 \u2212e+ plasma\ninitially created by the vacuum polarization process in the Dyadosphere. The\nplasma self\u2013propels outward and engulfs the baryonic remnant left over by\nthe collapse of the progenitor star. As such pulse reaches transparency, the\nProper\u2013GRB is emitted. The remaining accelerated baryons interacting with\nthe ISM produce the afterglow emission. The ISM is described by the two\nadditional parameters of the theory: the average particle number density nISM\nand the ratio R between the effective emitting area and the total area of the\npulse [7], which takes into account the ISM filamentary structure [8]. The\nbest fit of the observational data (see Fig.2.Left) leads to a total energy of\nthe Dyadosphere Edya = 1.85 \u00d7 1050 erg and the amount of baryonic matter\nin the remnant is B = 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 . The ISM parameters are: < nism >= 0.3\nparticle/cm3 and < R >= 7.81 \u00d7 10\u22129 [9].\nThe luminosity in selected energy bands is evaluated integrating over the\nEQuiTemporal Surfaces (EQTS) [10] the energy density released in the interaction of the accelerated baryons with the ISM measured in the co\u2013moving\nframe, duly boosted in the observer frame.

Left: Theoretically simulated light curve of the GRB 031203 prompt emission in the 20 \u2212 200 keV energy band (solid line) is compared with the observed data\n[4]. Right: Three theoretically predicted time\u2013integrated photon number spectra\nN (E) are here represented (dashed, dotted, dashed\u2013dotted lines). The theoretically\npredicted time\u2013integrated photon number spectrum N (E) corresponding to the first\n20 s of the prompt emission (solid line) is compared with the data observed by INTEGRAL [4].\n\nmoving frame of the accelerated baryonic matter is assumed to have a thermal\nspectrum [7]. In addition to the luminosity in fixed energy bands we can derive\nalso the instantaneous photon number spectrum N (E). Although the spectrum in the co\u2013moving frame of the expanding pulse is thermal, the shape\nof the final spectrum in the laboratory frame is non thermal. In fact each\nsingle instantaneous spectrum is the result of an integration of hundreds of\nthermal spectra over the corresponding EQTS [10]. This calculation produces\na non thermal instantaneous spectrum in the observer frame. We integrated\nthe photon number spectrum N (E) over the whole duration of the prompt\nevent: in this way we obtain a typical non\u2013thermal power\u2013law spectrum which\nresults to be in good agreement with the INTEGRAL data and gives a clear\nevidence of the possibility that the observed GRBs spectra are originated from\na thermal emission [9] (see Fig.1.Right).\n\n2 The GRB 031203/Sn2003lw/URCA-3 connection.\nIn the early days of neutron star physics it was clearly shown by Gamow and\nShoenberg [11] that the URCA processes are at the very heart of the Supernova explosions. The neutrino\u2013antineutrino emission described in the URCA\nprocess is the essential cooling mechanism necessary for the occurrence of the\nprocess of gravitational collapse of the imploding core. Since then, it has become clear that the newly formed neutron star can be still significantly hot\nand in its early stages will be associated to three major radiating processes\n[12]: a) the thermal radiation from the surface, b) the radiation due to neutrino, kaon, pion cooling, and c) the possible influence in both these processes\nof the superfluid nature of the supra-nuclear density neutron gas.\n\n\fTheoretical Interpretation of GRB 031203 and URCA-3.\n\n3\n\nWe already proposed that the Supernova explosion can be the result of an\ninduced gravitational collapse [13], and the X\u2013ray emission observed is the sign\nof the cooling of the young neutron star born from the Supernova explosion\n(see GRB 980425/SN1998bw/URCA-1 [14] and GRB 030329/SN2003dh/URCA2 [15]). This possibility was explored also for the system GRB 031203/SN2003lw.\nAlso in this case the observations in other wavelengths could be related to the\nSupernova event, which we called URCA-3 (see Fig.2).\n\nTheoretical curve 20-200 keV\nTheoretical curve 0.2-10 KeV\nINTEGRAL mean flux 20-200 keV\nXMM data 0.2-10 keV\nChandra data 2-10 keV\n\n1048\n\n10-6\n\n10-8\n\n1046\n\n10-10\n\n1044\n\n10-12\n\n1042\n\n10-14\n\n1040\n\n10-16\n\n1038\n\n1036\n\nObserved flux (ergs/(cm2*s))\n\nLuminosity per unit solid angle (dE/(dtd\u03a9) (ergs/(s*sterad))\n\n1050\n\n10-18\n10-2\n\n100\n\n102\n104\nDetector arrival time (tad) (s)\n\n106\n\n108\n\nFig. 2.
