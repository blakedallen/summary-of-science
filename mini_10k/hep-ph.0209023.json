In supersymmetric models,\nthere are many additional sources of CP violation as well as new flavor structures [2]. In\nthis paper, I will concentrate on the quark\u2013squark sector and will ignore leptonic effects\nfor simplicity. Then, the relevant superpotential and the soft SUSY breaking terms are\nwritten as follows:\n\u2206W = \u2212\u01242 Yiju Q\u0302i \u00dbj + \u01241 Yijd Q\u0302i D\u0302j \u2212 \u03bc\u01241 \u01242 ,\n2q\n2u\n2d\n\u2217\n\u2206Vs.b. = Mij L q\u0303Li q\u0303Lj\n+ Mij R \u0169Ri \u0169\u2217Rj + Mij R d \u0303Ri d \u0303\u2217Rj + m21 |H1 |2 + m22 |H2 |2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1X\nMi \u03bbi \u03bbi .\n+ \u2212H2 Auij q\u0303i \u0169\u2217j + H1 Adij q\u0303i d \u0303\u2217j \u2212 B\u03bcH1 H2 + h.c. \u2212\n2 i\n\n(2)\n\nClearly, all quantities with flavor indices can contain flavor\u2013dependent and, possibly,\nflavor\u2013independent CP violating phases. The latter (e.g. overall phases of the A-terms,\n1\n\n\f\u03bc, B\u03bc, Mi ) have been studied scrupulously in the past, while the former (e.g. the off\u2013\ndiagonal phases of M 2qL , etc.) have not received as much attention. One of the reasons\nbesides cumbersomeness is that such phases are basis\u2013dependent and thus should be\ntreated with care. In the case of the Standard Model, the flavor\u2013dependent CKM phase\ncan be expressed in terms of the Jarlskog invariant. An important question to address is\nwhat is the generalization of the Jarlskog invariant for supersymmetric models and how\nit is related to the SUSY CP phases.\nThe class of supersymmetric models under consideration possesses the following symmetries\n(3)\nU(3)Q\u0302L \u00d7 U(3)\u00dbR \u00d7 U(3)D\u0302R\nacting on the quark superfields, which preserve the structure of the supergauge interactions. The CP transformation acts on the Yukawa and mass matrices as the complex\nconjugation:\nCP\nM \u2212\u2192 M \u2217 ,\n(4)\nwhere M = {Y u , Y d , M 2qL , M 2uR , M 2dR , Au , Ad }. If this can be \"undone\" with the symmetry transformation (3), the physical flavor\u2013dependent CP phases vanish. Supersymmetric models also possess the Peccei-Quinn and R symmetries U(1)PQ and U(1)R , which\nallow us to eliminate two of the flavor\u2013independent phases (see e.g. [3]). Then, in order\nfor CP to be conserved, the invariant CP\u2013phases\nArg [(B\u03bc)\u2217 \u03bcMi ] , Arg [A\u2217\u03b1 Mi ]\n\n(5)\n\nhave to vanish too. Here Arg[A\u03b1 ] , \u03b1 = u, d, denotes the \"overall\" phases of the A-terms\nwhich can be defined in a basis\u2013independent way as\ni\u0011\n\u0010\nh\n1\nArg [A\u03b1 ] \u2261 Arg Det A\u03b1 Y\u03b1\u2020 ,\n(6)\n3\nprovided this determinant is non\u2013zero. The flavor\u2013independent phases are not affected\nby the quark superfield basis transformation and thus are physically meaningful. The\ndiscussion of the flavor\u2013dependent phases is much more involved. The main subject\nof this paper is to find the physical CP\u2013phases, i.e. those which are invariant under\nphase redefinitions of the quark superfields in analogy with the CKM phase, and the\ncorresponding basis\u2013invariant quantities similar to the Jarlskog invariant.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 I build up necessary techniques to\nhandle the issues of CP violation in theories with many flavor structures. In section 3 I\napply these methods to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and provide some\nexamples of how observable quantities can be written in manifestly reparametrization\ninvariant form.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nAuxiliary Construction.\nThe case of three matrices.\n\nIn the Standard Model, the CP\u2013odd invariant is built on the hermitian quantities Y u Y u\u2020\nand Y d Y d\u2020 which transform in the same way under a basis transformation, i.e. Y u Y u\u2020 \u2192\n2\n\n\fUL Y u Y u\u2020 UL\u2020 and Y d Y d\u2020 \u2192 UL Y d Y d\u2020 UL\u2020 . Suppose, in addition to these, we have another\nquantity with the same transformation property, for instance, M 2qL . Denoting A \u2261\nY u Y u\u2020 , B \u2261 Y d Y d\u2020 , and C \u2261 M 2qL , we have\nA \u2192 UL A UL\u2020 , B \u2192 UL B UL\u2020 , C \u2192 UL C UL\u2020 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere UL is a U(3) quark superfield transformation Q\u0302L \u2192 (UL )T Q\u0302L (clearly, these quantities are invariant under the right\u2013handed superfield transformations). What are the\ninvariant CP\u2013violating quantities and the physical CP\u2013phases in this case?\nTaking advantage of the unitary symmetry, let us go over to the basis where one of\nthe matrices, say A, is diagonal. In this basis,\n\uf8eb\n\na1\n\uf8ec\nA=\uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\na2\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nb11\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2217\n0 \uf8f8 , B = \uf8ed b12\nb\u221713\na3\n\nb12\nb22\nb\u221723\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nc11\nb13\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2217\nb23 \uf8f8 , C = \uf8ed c12\nc\u221713\nb33\n\nc12\nc22\nc\u221723\n\n\uf8f6\n\nc13\n\uf8f7\nc23 \uf8f8 .\nc33\n\n(8)\n\nThe residual symmetry is associated with the U(3) generators commuting with the diagonal matrix A. These are two SU(3) Cartan subalgebra generators and the generator\nproportional to the unit matrix. This means that B and C are defined up to the phase\ntransformation B, C \u2192 U1 B, C U1\u2020 with\n\u0010\n\nU1 = diag ei\u03b41 , ei\u03b42 , ei\u03b43\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nUnder this phase transformation the matrix elements transform as\nbij \u2212\u2192 bij ei(\u03b4i \u2212\u03b4j )\n\n(10)\n\nand similarly for cij . Physically this freedom corresponds to the arbitrariness in the choice\nof the quark superfield phases. The quark and squark fields are to be transformed with\nthe same phases in order not to pick up CP phases in the interaction vertices such as\nq\u0303 \u2217 qg\u0303. In our basis, A = diag(m2u , m2c , m2t )/v22 , B = V diag(m2d , m2s , m2b )V \u2020 /v12 , where V\nis the CKM matrix and v1,2 are the Higgs VEVs. The supergauge vertices are diagonal\nand the flavor mixing is contained in the propagators (and the non\u2013gauge vertices). The\nresidual rephasing symmetry implies that all physical quantities must be invariant under\na phase redefinition of the quark superfields.\nIf we have only two matrices A and B, the only reparametrization\u2013invariant CP phase\nwe can construct is the CKM\u2013type phase\n\u03c60 = Arg(b12 b\u221713 b23 ) .\n\n(11)\n\nIn the case of three matrices, there are 3 additional non\u2013CKM\u2013type invariant phases\n\u03c6i = \u01ebijk Arg(bjk c\u2217jk ) ,\n\n(12)\n\ni.e. Arg(b12 c\u221712 ), etc. In the non\u2013degenerate case, the other physical CP\u2013phases can be\nexpressed in terms of these 4 phases. For instance, the CKM\u2013type phase for the matrix\nC, \u03c6\u20320 \u2261Arg(c12 c\u221713 c23 ), is given by \u03c6\u20320 = \u03c60 \u2212 \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c63 (yet, this is not true in the\n3\n\n\fdegenerate case, e.g. when some bij = 0). The number of physical phases can also be\ncomputed by a simple parameter counting. Three hermitian matrices have nine phases. A\nU(3) transformation has six phases, of which one leaves all hermitian matrices invariant.\nThus the number of non\u2013removable phases is 9-5=4. An interesting feature here is that\na new class of reparametrization\u2013invariant CP\u2013phases, not expressible in terms of those\nof the CKM type, arises.\nConsequently, the necessary and sufficient conditions for CP conservation are\n\u03c60 = \u03c6\u20320 = \u03c6i = 0 mod \u03c0 (i = 1, 2, 3) .\n\n(13)\n\nHaving identified a set of the physical CP phases, one may ask what are the weak\nbasis CP\u2013odd invariants associated with such phases. In the case of two matrices, there\nis only one independent CP\u2013odd invariant which can be written as\nJAB = ImTr[A, B]3 .\n\n(14)\n\nIt is proportional to the Jarlskog invariant of Eq.(1) and sin \u03c60 . In the case of three\nmatrices with the same transformation properties, one can construct a number of CP\u2013\nodd invariants such as\u2217\nKABC (p, q, r) = ImTr[Ap , B q ]C r\n(15)\nwith integer p, q, r. This invariant can also be written as ImTrAp [B q , C r ] or an imaginary\npart of the trace of the completely antisymmetric product of Ap , B q , and C r . For p = q =\nr = 1 it is proportional to a linear combination of sin \u03c6i (i = 1, 2, 3):\nKABC (1, 1, 1) = 2(a1 \u2212 a2 )|b12 c12 | sin \u03c63 + 2(a2 \u2212 a3 )|b23 c23 | sin \u03c61 + 2(a3 \u2212 a1 )|b13 c13 | sin \u03c62 .\n(16)\nIt is worth emphasising that the K-invariants are entirely new objects which cannot be\nexpressed in terms of the Jarlskog invariants and vice versa. The simplest way to see\nthat is to imagine that A and B (and maybe C) have 2 degenerate eigenvalues. Then\nall Jarlskog invariants JAB , JBC , and JCA vanish. Yet, the K-invariants can be nonzero.\nAnd conversely, suppose that A is proportional to the unit matrix. Then all K-invariants\nvanish, while JBC can be nonzero.\nIt is instructive to express these invariants in terms of the eigenvalues and the mutual\nCKM\u2013type matrices. That is, write Eq.(8) as\nA = diag(a1 , a2 , a3 ) , B = V diag(b1 , b2 , b3 ) V \u2020 , C = U diag(c1 , c2 , c3 ) U \u2020 .\n\n(17)\n\nThen,\nKABC (p, q, r) =\n\nX\n\n(api \u2212 apj )bqk crl Vik Vjk\u2217 Ujl Uil\u2217 .\n\n(18)\n\nijkl\n\nNote the appearance of the rephasing invariant quantities Vik Vjk\u2217 Ujl Uil\u2217 which generalize the\nCKM\u2013type combination Vik Vjk\u2217 Vjl Vil\u2217 . To be exact, there are three independent invariant\n\u2217\n\nThe commutator under the trace can also be raised to an odd power. This will not provide independent invariants and I omit its discussion for brevity.\n\n4\n\n\fquantities\nX\n\n\u03c61 = Arg\n\nbi V2i V3i\u2217\n\ni\n\nX\n\n\u03c62 = \u2212Arg\n\n!\n\nbi V1i V3i\u2217\n\ni\n\n\u03c63 = Arg\n\nX\n\nbi V1i V2i\u2217\n\ni\n\nX\n\nci U2i U3i\u2217\n\ni\n\n!\n\n!\n\nX\n\n!\u2217\n\nci U1i U3i\u2217\n\ni\n\nX\n\nci U1i U2i\u2217\n\ni\n\n,\n\n!\u2217\n\n!\u2217\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhile the other are functions of these and \u03c60 . Indeed, let us consider an example of\nKABC (1, 2, 1).

From\nthe above exercise it is clear that, in the non-degenerate case, one can choose\nP\n\nJAB , KABC (1, 1, 1) , KABC (2, 1, 1) , KABC (1, 2, 1)\n\n(23)\n\nas the basis of the CP\u2013odd invariants. Given the values of these four invariants, the mixing\nangles, and the eigenvalues, one can solve for the physical CP\u2013phases \u03c6i (i = 0..3). A\ncomplication here, compared to the Standard Model, is that the K\u2013invariants generally\nare non\u2013trivial functions of these CP\u2013phases. The necessary and sufficient conditions for\nCP conservation can be expressed as\nImTr[A, B]3 = ImTr[B, C]3 = ImTr[C, A]3 = ImTr[Ap , Bq ]Cr = 0\nfor any p, q, r.\n\n5\n\n(24)\n\n\f2.1.1\n\nDegenerate case.\n\nSo far we have been assuming that all of the physical phases are non\u2013zero. It is important\nto find out under which circumstances some of them vanish. To do that, let us go back\nto Eq.(8). Now, suppose that two eigenvalues of matrix A are degenerate, a1 = a2 . In\nthis case, one of the physical phases will disappear. Indeed, the residual symmetry in this\ncase is U(2) \u00d7 U(1). Using this symmetry the upper left 2\u00d72 block of matrix B can be\ndiagonalized:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\nb11 b12\nb11 0\n\u2020\nU2\nU\n\u2212\u2192\n,\n(25)\n2\nb\u221712 b22\n0 b\u203222\nwhere U2 is a U(2) matrix. As a result, the invariant phase \u03c63 vanishes. Of course, the\nCKM\u2013type phase \u03c60 also vanishes, but it can be replaced with an analogous phase built\nfrom the matrix elements of C: \u03c6\u20320 = Arg(c12 c\u221713 c23 ). Thus, the basis for the remaining\nphysical phases can be chosen as\n\u03c6\u20320 , \u03c61 , \u03c62 .\n(26)\nNow suppose that two of the eigenvalues of matrix B are also degenerate. By a\nunitary (permutational) transformation these can be made b1 and b2 . This introduces an\nadditional U(2) symmetry, so the CKM matrix between A and B is now defined only up\nto a U(2) \u00d7 U(1) biunitary transformation, i.e.\nA = diag(a, a, a3 ) , B = U2 V \u01682\u2020 diag(b, b, b3 ) \u01682 V \u2020 U2\u2020 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere U2 and \u01682 have a U(2) block in upper left corner and a phase in the (33) position.\nSince any matrix can be diagonalized by a biunitary transformation, the upper left block\nof V can be brought to a diagonal form, i.e. V12\u2032 = V21\u2032 = 0. The unitarity of V \u2032 then\nrequires V13\u2032 = V31\u2032 = 0 and |V11\u2032 | = 1 (or V23\u2032 = V32\u2032 = 0 and |V22\u2032 | = 1 ),\nei\u03b8\n\uf8ec\n\u2032\nV =\uf8ed 0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nV22\u2032\nV32\u2032\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\uf8f7\nV23\u2032 \uf8f8 .\nV33\u2032\n\n(28)\n\nThis results in b12 = b13 = 0. We therefore see that the residual symmetry allows us to\neliminate two of the physical phases. The remaining CP phases are\n\u03c6\u20320 , \u03c61 .\n\n(29)\n\nFinally, if two eigenvalues of C are also degenerate, \u03c6\u20320 = 0 and the only physical phase is\n\u03c61 .\n\n(30)\n\nNote that in this case Tr[A, B]C \u221d sin \u03c61 .\nNow let us briefly discuss the case of three degenerate eigenvalues. If A \u221d I, the\nresidual symmetry is U(3) which allows us to diagonalize another matrix, say B. Then\nthe only invariant phase is\n\u03c6\u20320\n(31)\n6\n\n\fand JBC \u221d sin \u03c6\u20320 . It is clear that if either B or C have degenerate eigenvalues, no CP\nviolation occurs.\nThese results can also be obtained by a naive parameter counting. U(2) has an extra\nphase parameter compared to U(1) \u00d7 U(1), so enlarging the residual symmetry from\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) to U(2) will reduce the number of physical phases by one. Similarly, U(3)\nwill allow us to eliminate three more phases compared to U(1) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe number of the physical phases also reduces if some of the mixings are zero. The\nmixing angles are defined through the following parametrization of a unitary matrix V\n(up to a phase transformation) [4]:\n\uf8eb\n\nC12 C13\n\uf8ec\nV = \uf8ed \u2212S12 C23 \u2212 C12 S23 S13 ei\u03b413\nS12 S23 \u2212 C12 C23 S13 ei\u03b413\n\nS12 C13\nC12 C23 \u2212 S12 S23 S13 ei\u03b413\n\u2212C12 S23 \u2212 S12 C23 S13 ei\u03b413\n\nS13 e\u2212i\u03b413\n\uf8f7\nS23 C13 \uf8f8 ,\nC23 C13\n\uf8f6\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b413 is a phase; Sij = sin \u03b8ij , Cij = cos \u03b8ij , and \u03b812 , \u03b813 , \u03b823 are the mixing angles. It\nis easy to see that one vanishing mixing angle annuls one phase, say the CKM\u2013type phase\n\u03c60 . Another vanishing mixing eliminates \u03c6\u20320 which is equivalent to saying \u03c61 + \u03c62 + \u03c63 = 0.\nIf both of these mixings are in the same matrix, say V , then this implies that two of the\nelements {b12 , b13 , b23 } vanish, so again two of the physical phases disappear. Further, the\nthird zero mixing would eliminate another phase. The next step, however, is nontrivial.\nIf one matrix contains three zero mixings and the other \u2013 one, then no CP violation\nis possible. Indeed, this means that two matrices, e.g. A and B, are diagonalizable\nsimultaneously so that all K\u2013invariants vanish, whereas the J\u2013invariants vanish due to a\nsingle zero mixing. On the other hand, if V and U have two zero mixings each, then CP\nviolation is still possible. As mentioned above, in this case two of {b12 , b13 , b23 } and two\nof {c12 , c13 , c23 } vanish, so that one can have\n\uf8eb\n\na1\n\uf8ec\nA=\uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\na2\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nb11\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2217\n0 \uf8f8 , B = \uf8ed b12\n0\na3\n\nb12\nb22\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nc11\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2217\n0 \uf8f8 , C = \uf8ed c12\n0\nb33\n\nc12\nc22\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8 .\nc33\n\n(33)\n\nThe surviving invariant phase is \u03c63 = Arg(b12 c\u221712 ) and Tr[A, B]C \u221d sin \u03c63 . If the non\u2013\nvanishing off\u2013diagonal entries are misaligned, CP is conserved. No CP violation can occur\nif five of the mixing angles are zero.\n\n2.2\n\nGeneralization to more than three matrices.\n\nSuppose we have N hermitian matrices H1 , H2 , ..HN with the same transformation properties, Hi \u2192 UL Hi UL\u2020 . How can the results of the previous subsection be generalized for\nthis case?\nThe generalization is quite straightforward. Using the unitary freedom, we bring H1\nto the diagonal form:\n\uf8eb\n\n(H1 )1\n\uf8ec\nH1 = \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n(H1 )2\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(H2 )11\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0 \uf8f8 , H2 = \uf8ed (H2 )\u221712\n(H2 )\u221713\n(H1 )3\n7\n\n(H2 )12\n(H2 )22\n(H2 )\u221723\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(H2 )13\n\uf8f7\n(H2 )23 \uf8f8 , ...\n(H2 )33\n\n(34)\n\n\fThe reparametrization invariant phases can be constructed by taking cyclic products of\nthe elements of the same matrix or by taking products of elements in the same positions\nin different matrices. In the non\u2013degenerate case, the 3N \u2212 5 independent phases can be\nchosen as\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03c60 = Arg [(H2 )12 (H2 )\u221713 (H2 )23 ] , \u03c6ai = \u01ebijk Arg (H2 )jk (Ha )\u2217jk , a = 3...N .\n\n(35)\n\nAny other physical phase can be expressed in terms of these basis phases. The corresponding weak basis invariants are\nJH1 H2 , KH1 H2 Ha (p, q, r) , a = 3...N ,\n\n(36)\n\nwith (p, q, r) = {(1, 1, 1); (2, 1, 1); (1, 2, 1)}.\nIn the degenerate case, the discussion of the previous subsection equally applies. Any\nadditional U(2) symmetry, i.e. the presence of two degenerate eigenvalues, eliminates\none physical phase which can be taken to be the CKM\u2013type phase for this matrix. An\nextra U(3) eliminates three physical phases, for instance \u03c6a1,2,3 . A vanishing mixing angle\ntypically entails one vanishing phase, yet there are subtleties discussed above.\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for CP conservation can be written as\nr\n=0\nImTr[Hi , Hj ]3 = ImTrH[ip Hjq Hk]\n\n(37)\n\nfor any i, j, k and p, q, r. Here the square brackets denote antisymmetrization with respect\nto the indices. These conditions amount to\nh\n\ni\n\nArg [(H\u03b1 )12 (H\u03b1 )\u221713 (H\u03b1 )23 ] = \u01ebijk Arg (H\u03b1 )jk (H\u03b2 )\u2217jk = 0 mod \u03c0\n\n(38)\n\nfor all \u03b1, \u03b2, and i.\nOne may wonder whether it is possible to construct CP\u2013odd K\u2013 type invariants with\nmore than three matrices under the trace. This is certainly possible, yet they will be\nfunctions of the basic reparametrization invariant phases (35) or, in a more general case,\n(38), and thus will not provide independent CP violating quantities.\n\n3\n\nThe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.\n\nThe general technology of the previous section can be applied (with some reservations)\nto the case of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The MSSM has\na number of flavor structures which transform under the U(3)Q\u0302L \u00d7 U(3)\u00dbR \u00d7 U(3)D\u0302R\nsymmetry. In particular, the transformation properties are given by\nY u \u2212\u2192 UL Y u Uu\u2020 ,\nR\n\nY\n\nd\n\nd\n\n\u2212\u2192 UL Y\n\nUd\u2020\nR\n\n,\n\nAu \u2212\u2192 UL Au Uu\u2020 ,\nR\n\nd\n\nA\n\nd\n\n\u2212\u2192 UL A\n\nUd\u2020\nR\n\n,\n\nM 2qL \u2212\u2192 UL M 2qL UL\u2020 ,\nM 2uR \u2212\u2192 UuR M 2uR Uu\u2020 ,\nR\n\nM\n\n2dR\n\n\u2212\u2192 UdR M\n8\n\n2dR\n\nUd\u2020\nR\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\n\fTo construct the weak basis invariants, it is necessary to identify hermitian objects which\ntransform under one of the unitary groups. These are given in Table 1. Not all of them\nare, however, independent. In particular, only three matrices out of\nAu Au\u2020 , Au\u2020 Au , Au Y u\u2020 + h.c. , Au\u2020 Y u + h.c.\n\n(40)\n\ncontain independent phases in the off-diagonal elements. This can be seen as follows. Let\nus go over to the basis where Y u is diagonal, Y u \u2192 UL Y u Uu\u2020R = diag(mu , mc , mt )/v2 .\nGiven Au Au\u2020 and Au\u2020 Au , we can find Au up to a phase transformation. Indeed, Au Au\u2020\nand Au\u2020 Au fix the diagonalization matrices of Au :\nu2 u2\nAu Au\u2020 \u2212\u2192 \u0168L Au Au\u2020 \u0168L\u2020 = diag(au2\n1 , a2 , a3 ) ,\nu2 u2\nAu\u2020 Au \u2212\u2192 \u0168uR Au\u2020 Au \u0168u\u2020R = diag(au2\n1 , a2 , a3 ) ,\n\n(41)\n\nso that Au is given by\nAu = \u0168u\u2020 diag(au1 , au2 , au3 )\u0168L .\nR\n\n(42)\n\nNote that both \u0168uR and \u0168L are only defined up to a diagonal phase transformation,\n\u0168uR \u223c diag(ei\u03b41 , ei\u03b42 , ei\u03b43 ) \u0168uR , \u0168L \u223c diag(ei\u03c61 , ei\u03c62 , ei\u03c63 ) \u0168L .\n\n(43)\n\nThis introduces a phase ambiguity in the matrix elements of Au . A phase transformation\nwith \u03b4i = \u03c6i leaves Au intact, whereas that with \u03b4i = \u2212\u03c6i changes it. This remaining\nambiguity is eliminated by fixing Au Y u\u2020 + h.c. such that Au and Au\u2020 Y u + h.c. can be\ndetermined unambiguously. This can also be understood by parameter counting: Au has\nnine phases which, in the non\u2013degenerate case, can be found from the nine phases of the\nthree hermitian matrices Au Au\u2020 , Au\u2020 Au , and Au Y u\u2020 +h.c. Of course, similar considerations\napply to Ad\u2020 Y d + h.c.\nThis argument can be generalized to an arbitrary number of generations N. N 2 phases\nof Au can be found via N(N \u22121) phases of Au Au\u2020 and Au\u2020 Au , and N phases of Au Y u\u2020 +h.c.\nAlthough Au Y u\u2020 + h.c. has N(N \u2212 1)/2 phases, only N of them are independent and\ncorrespond to the residual phase freedom with \u0168L = \u0168u\u2020R = diag(ei\u03b41 , .., ei\u03b4N ). This,\nhowever, does not work if N > N(N \u2212 1)/2 in which case \u03b4i cannot be determined\nunambiguously from the off\u2013diagonal phases of Au Y u\u2020 + h.c. So, for N = 1 and N =\n2, additional information besides the hermitian quantities is needed which can be, for\ninstance, the anti\u2013hermitian matrix Au Y u\u2020 \u2212 h.c.\nLet us now identify the physical CP phases. First of all, the physical phases must be\ninvariant under the U(1)PQ and U(1)R symmetries. By an R\u2013rotation, the gluino mass\ncan be made real, so henceforth the phases of the A\u2013terms will be assumed to be relative\nto the gluino phase. Similarly, by a Peccei\u2013Quinn transformation the B\u03bc term can be\nmade real. Thus we have three CP phases in the flavor independent objects \u03bc,M1 , and M2 .\nThe phases of the flavor\u2013dependent objects can be easily counted: out of the original 45\nphases of the flavor objects 17 can be eliminated by the U(3)3 symmetry (one of the U(1)\ntransformations leaves all flavor structures intact), leaving 28 physical phases. These can\nbe expressed in terms of the reparametrization invariant phases of the hermitian matrices.\n9\n\n\fU(3)Q\u0302L\nY u Y u\u2020\nY d Y d\u2020\nM 2qL\nAu Au\u2020\nAd Ad\u2020\nAu Y u\u2020 + h.c.\nAd Y d\u2020 + h.c.\n\nU(3)\u00dbR\nY u\u2020 Y u\nM 2uR\nAu\u2020 Au\nAu\u2020 Y u + h.c.\n\nU(3)D\u0302R\nY d\u2020 Y d\nM 2dR\nAd\u2020 Ad\nAd\u2020 Y d + h.c.\n\nTable 1: Hermitian objects of the MSSM transforming under the unitary flavor symmetries.\nThe three columns of Table 1 form three separate sequences. Using the unitary freedom,\nthe first matrix in each column can be made diagonal. Then the strategy of section 2\ncan be applied. Each column has 3N \u2212 5 physical phases, where N is the number of\nmatrices in the column. However, as I argued above, the two matrices Au\u2020 Y u + h.c. and\nAd\u2020 Y d + h.c. are not independent. In particular, that means that, in the second column,\nthe CKM\u2013type phase for Au\u2020 Y u + h.c. is not an independent phase, whereas the phase\ndifferences of the off\u2013diagonal elements of Au\u2020 Y u + h.c. and M 2uR , and Au\u2020 Y u + h.c. and\nAu\u2020 Au are independent. Therefore, instead of 7 phases in the second column we should\nonly count 6, and similarly for the third column. Thus, we end up with 16+6+6=28\nphysical independent phases, as expected.\nIn the basis where Y u Y u\u2020 , Y u\u2020 Y u , and Y d\u2020 Y d are diagonal, the 28 independent physical\nphases can be chosen as follows:\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03c60 = Arg (Y d Y d\u2020 )12 (Y d Y d\u2020 )\u221713 (Y d Y d\u2020 )23 ,\n\u03c6ai\n\u03c7ai\n\n\u0014\n\nd\n\n= \u01ebijk Arg (Y Y\n\u0014\n\nu\u2020\n\nd\u2020\n\n)jk (F a )\u2217jk\n\nu\n\n= \u01ebijk Arg (A Y +\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\nh.c.)jk (Ga )\u2217jk\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03beia = \u01ebijk Arg (Ad\u2020 Y d + h.c.)jk (H a )\u2217jk ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere\nF a = {M 2qL , Au Au\u2020 , Ad Ad\u2020 , Au Y u\u2020 + h.c., Ad Y d\u2020 + h.c.} ,\nGa = {M 2uR , Au\u2020 Au } ,\nH a = {M 2dR , Ad\u2020 Ad } .\n\n(45)\n\nHere I have assumed that there are no degenerate eigenvalues and the mixing angles are\nnon\u2013zero. The corresponding weak basis CP\u2013odd invariants are given by Eq.(36).\nIn the degenerate case, i.e. when some mixing angles are zero and/or there are degenerate eigenvalues, the situation becomes more complicated. In particular, the intrinsically\nnon\u2013hermitian objects such as A\u03b1 may have CP\u2013phases which cannot be \"picked up\" by\n10\n\n\fthe hermitian quantities in the degenerate case. This occurs, for instance, when only a\n2\u00d72 block of A\u03b1 is non\u2013zero such that we effectively deal with two generations. Another\nexample is the case when Au and Y u can be diagonalized simultaneously. Then, in the\nbasis where they are diagonal, the reparametrization invariant CP\u2013phases are\n\u03c1ui = Arg(Auii Yiiu\u2217 )\n\n(46)\n\nand similarly for Ad . On the other hand, the hermitian matrices Au Au\u2020 , Au\u2020 Au and\nAu Y u\u2020 +h.c. are diagonal (and real), so there are no CP phases associated with them. The\nCP violating invariants corresponding to the phases \u03c1ui are based on the anti\u2013hermitian\nmatrices:\nh\ni\n(47)\nLAu Y u (p) = ImTr (Au Y u\u2020 )p \u2212 h.c. ,\nwhere p is an integer. For p = 1, this becomes\nLAu Y u (1) = 2\n\nX\n\n|Auii mui /v2 | sin \u03c1ui .\n\n(48)\n\ni\n\nQuantities of the type ImTr(A\u03b1\u2020 Y \u03b1 )p do not provide independent CP\u2013violating invariants.\nFurther, if all Auij are non\u2013zero in the basis where Y u is diagonal, \u03c1ui are not independent\nand are functions of the phases (44).\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for CP conservation are\nImTr[Mi , Mj ]3 = ImTrM[ip Mjq Mk]r = 0 ,\nImTr(A\u03b1 Y \u03b1\u2020 )p = 0\n\n(49)\n\nfor any i, j, k and p, q, r; \u03b1 = {u, d}. Here Mi are hermitian matrices belonging to the\nsame column of Table 1 and these conditions are to be satisfied for each column. In\naddition, one, of course, has to require that the gaugino and the \u03bc-term phases vanish. In\nthis case, the full MSSM will conserve CP. If all of the physical phases (44) and (46) are\nmuch smaller than one, CP is an approximate symmetry (yet, this is unrealistic as the\nCKM phase is of order one experimentally). In terms of basis\u2013independent quantities,\nthis implies that, when the mixing angles and the eigenvalues are fixed, the J-, K-, and\nL-invariants are close to zero (in the appropriate units).\nIf we are to require that the CKM phase be the only source of CP violation, all\ninvariants apart from ImTr[Y u Y u\u2020 , Y d Y d\u2020 ]3 must vanish. This occurs, for instance, when\nall SUSY flavor structures are proportional to the unit matrix and the A\u2013terms are real.\nIt is important to note that it is not sufficient to require that the SUSY flavor structures\nbe real in some basis because the presence of CP phases in the Yukawas can make some\nof the invariants, apart from the Jarlskog one, non\u2013zero. For example, when Y u Y u\u2020 is\ndiagonal, Y d Y d\u2020 = V diag(m2d , m2s , m2b )V \u2020 /v12 , and M 2qL is real, the invariant phases \u03c61i and\nImTr[Y u Y u\u2020 , Y d Y d\u2020 ]M 2qL are nonzero. This creates certain difficulties for realistic string\nmodels with low energy supersymmetry [5]. The reason is that such models generally\npredict non\u2013universal A\u2013terms. Then even if the SUSY breaking F\u2013terms are real, the\ncomplex phases of the type (46) are generated by the basis transformation which brings\nthe Yukawa couplings to the diagonal form. Equivalently, this means that some of the L\u2013\n11\n\n\for K\u2013invariants are non\u2013zero. As a result, large electric dipole moments of fermions are\ninduced, in conflict with experiment.\nFinally, it should be noted that after the electroweak symmetry breaking a number of\ncorrections to the Lagrangian (2) will appear. In particular, M 2qL will split into M 2uL\nand M 2dL due to the isospin breaking corrections. Since no additional sources of CP\nviolation arise in this process, the consequent CP phases will be functions of the original\nphases (44) and (46).\n\n3.1\n\nExamples.\n\nLet us consider a few phenomenological examples.\ni. Kaon mixing. A first example is a supersymmetric contribution to the K \u2212 K\u0304\nmixing. This is conveniently expressed in terms of the mass insertions [6]. Suppose that we\nwork in the super\u2013CKM basis, i.e. the basis where the quark mass matrices are diagonal,\nd\nand that the only non\u2013vanishing mass insertion is (\u03b4LL\n)12 \u2261 (M 2dL )12 /m\u03032 where m\u03032 is\nthe average squark mass. Then the gluino\u2013mediated contribution to the \u03b5K parameter is\nd 2\nusually written as [7] (\u03b5K )SUSY \u221d Im(\u03b4LL\n)12 . Clearly, this result is not rephasing invariant.\nThe super\u2013CKM basis is defined only up to a phase transformation, which physics should\nbe independent of. It can be shown that, in fact\u2020 ,\nh\n\nd\n(\u03b5K )SUSY \u221d Im (\u03b4LL\n)12 V21 V22\u2217\n\ni2\n\n.\n\n(50)\n\nd\nAs a result, the K \u2212 K\u0304 mixing constrains the invariant quantity (\u03b4LL\n)12 V21 V22\u2217 and even\na real mass insertion can lead to CP violation. Ref.[7] assumes a special form of the\nCKM matrix in which V21 V22\u2217 is real. Note, however, that, unlike in the Standard Model,\ndifferent CKM \"conventions\" are not physically equivalent. This is due to the presence\nof the additional invariant phases (35). In other words, diagonalization of the Yukawa\nmatrices leads to the CKM matrix in some generic phase convention. To bring it to a\nspecial form, one rotates the quark and squark fields simultaneously thereby inducing\nCP\u2013phases in M 2dL even if it was real initially. Equivalently, the K-invariants such as\nImTr[Y d Y d\u2020 , Y u Y u\u2020 ]M 2dL may not vanish even if M 2dL is real. Thus, in all phenomenological analyses the definition of the super-CKM basis must be supplemented with the\nspecification of the phase convention of the CKM matrix.\nThe reparametrization invariant phases can be identified as follows. By choosing an\nappropriate UL , let us go to the basis where\n\nY d Y d\u2020 = diag(m2d , m2s , m2b )/v12 , Y u Y u\u2020 = V \u2020 diag(m2u , m2c , m2t )V /v22 ,\n\n(51)\n\nwhere V is the CKM matrix. In this basis M 2dL is the same as in the super\u2013CKM basis.\nThe reparametrization invariant CP phases are the relative phases between the matrix\nelements of Y u Y u\u2020 and M 2dL in the same position. In particular, the relevant to the\nK \u2212 K\u0304 mixing invariant phase is\n\u03b4 = Arg\n\nX\n\n|mui |2 Vi1 Vi2\u2217\n\ni\n\n\u2020\n\n!\n\n\u0010\n\nM 2dL\n\n\u0011\n\n12\n\n.\n\nThis follows from the penguin dominance in the kaon decay amplitude.\n\n12\n\n(52)\n\n\fHere I have used the absolute values of the masses to stress their invariance with respect\nd\nto the phase transformations. If (\u03b4LL\n)12 is the only non\u2013zero mass insertion, there is only\none additional invariant phase \u2013 the CKM phase. Then, \u03b5K is a function of these two\nphases. Specifically, the relevant CP phase is expressed as\ni\n\nh\n\nd\nArg (\u03b4LL\n)12 V21 V22\u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b4CKM ) ,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03c6(\u03b4CKM ) is an invariant phase defined by\n|mt |2 V31 V32\u2217\n|mu |2 V11 V12\u2217\n+\n\u03c6(\u03b4CKM ) = Arg 1 +\n|mc |2 V21 V22\u2217\n|mc |2 V21 V22\u2217\n\"\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\nThe physical phases can be written in terms of the basis\u2013independent quantities. In\nd\nparticular, if (\u03b4LL\n)12 is the only non\u2013zero mass insertion then\nImTr[Y d Y d\u2020 , Y u Y u\u2020 ]M 2dL = 2\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nm2s \u2212 m2d X u 2\n\u2217\n2dL\nsin \u03b4 .\n|m\n|\nV\nV\nM\ni1\ni\ni2\n12\nv12 v22\ni\n\n(55)\n\nIn a more general case, the invariant phases and the magnitudes of the matrix elements\nof M 2dL can be found via 3 CP\u2013violating and 6 CP\u2013conserving weak basis invariants\nImTr[Y d Y d\u2020 , Y u Y u\u2020 ]M 2dL , ImTr[(Y d Y d\u2020 )2 , Y u Y u\u2020 ]M 2dL , ImTr[Y d Y d\u2020 , (Y u Y u\u2020 )2 ]M 2dL ,\nTr Y u Y u\u2020 M 2dL , Tr (Y u Y u\u2020 )2 M 2dL , Tr Y u Y u\u2020 (M 2dL )2 ,\nTr Y d Y d\u2020 M 2dL , Tr (Y d Y d\u2020 )2 M 2dL , Tr Y d Y d\u2020 (M 2dL )2 .\n(56)\nii. EDMs. Another example is a SUSY contribution to the electric dipole moments\nof the quarks. For the down quark, the relevant gluino\u2013mediated contribution is typically\nwritten as [7]\nd\n(dd )SUSY \u221d Im(\u03b4LR\n)11 M3\u2217 ,\n(57)\nd\nwith (\u03b4LR\n)11 \u223c v1 Ad11 /m\u03032 (omitting the \u03bc-term contribution). Again, it is clear that this\nresult is not rephasing invariant.\nTo rectify this problem, one may use the strategy advocated above. For the purpose\nof illustation, let us assume the following simple form of Ad in the super\u2013CKM basis:\n\nAd11\n\uf8ec\nAd = \uf8ed 0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\nAd12\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 .\n0\n\n(58)\n\nThe relevant physical phase can be expressed via the hermitian quantities of Table 1,\ncolumn 3:\n\u0011\u2217\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u03be = Arg Ad\u2020 Y d + h.c.\nAd\u2020 Ad\n= Arg Ad11 m\u2217d .\n(59)\n12\n\n12\n\nSince md has the same transformation properties under the left and right rephasings as\nAd11 , this expression is manifestly reparametrization invariant. The corresponding weak\nbasis invariant is ImTr[Y d\u2020 Y d , (Ad\u2020 Y d + h.c.)]Ad\u2020 Ad \u221d sin \u03be. Thus, Eq.(57) is to be modified as\nd\nd\n(\u03b4LR\n)11 \u2212\u2192 (\u03b4LR\n)11 ei\u03be .\n(60)\n13\n\n\fClearly, if md = 0, the SUSY EDM contribution vanishes.\nThe invariant phase associated with Ad12 can similarly be found from Ad Y d\u2020 + h.c. and\nY u Y u\u2020 . It is important to note that if Ad12 vanishes, Ad and Y d are diagonal simultaneously,\nand the phase of Ad11 cannot be extracted from hermitian quantities. In this case, the\nrelevant phase is given by Eq.(46) and the corresponding weak basis invariant is LAd Y d (1).\n\n4\n\nSummary.\n\nIn this work, I have studied the CP\u2013odd weak basis invariants in supersymmetric models\nand the corresponding reparametrization invariant CP phases. I have shown that, in SUSY\nmodels, a new class of CP\u2013odd invariants, not expressible in terms of the Jarlskog\u2013type\ninvariants, appears. I have also obtained basis independent conditions for CP conservation\nand clarified the issues of rephasing invariance of observable quantities.
