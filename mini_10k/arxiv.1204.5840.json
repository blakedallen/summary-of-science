Introduction\nTransient X-ray sources have been extensively studied since the\nadvent of X-ray astronomy. Most are in binary systems comprising at least one compact object, which is either a neutron star or\na black hole. Determining the nature of the compact object is not\ntrivial, as a number of their X-ray characteristics are common to\nboth types of objects. Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are\nuniquely identified by a mass determination of the compact object in excess of 3 M\u2299 . The first two confirmed BHXBs were\nCyg X-1 (Webster & Murdin 1972, Bolton 1972) and LMC X3 (Cowley et al. 1983); these systems were, however, persistent\nX-ray sources. The very first transient source with a confirmed\nblack hole, A0620\u221200 (McClintock & Remillard 1986), was discovered in 1975, when it reached intensities of \u223c50 Crab (Elvis\net al. 1975). To date there are 20 known BHXBs, of which 17\nare known to be transient (e.g., Remillard & McClintock 2006).\nThe BHXB transients belong to the class of low-mass X-ray biSend offprint requests to: E. Kuulkers\n\nnaries (LMXBs), i.e., binaries containing a low-mass (typically\n.1 M\u2299 ) companion orbiting a neutron star or a black hole.\nBHXBs are primarily discovered when they enter outbursts\ncharacterised by increased X-ray luminosities, by a factor of at\nleast 100 in a few days, and a variety of spectral and temporal variability states. The most contrasted states are the so-called\n'hard' and the 'soft' states. The former, originally was also defined as a 'low' state, owing to the representation of the spectrum\nby a power law with spectral index 1.4\u20132.0 up to several hundreds of keV. Conversely, the latter 'soft', or 'high', state is characterised by a tenfold increase of the \u223c2\u201310 keV flux. Several\nother states have been defined in the literature, depending also\non the evolution of the combined spectral and temporal variability properties (for extensive reviews, see Homan & Belloni 2005,\nBelloni 2010, and McClintock & Remillard 2006, Remillard &\nMcClintock 2006).\nOn 2010 September 25 08:05 UTC, the Swift/Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) triggered on a source located roughly 17\u25e6\nabove the Galactic plane. The source was initially designated\nas Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 100925A (Mangano et al. 2010),\n\n\f2\n\nE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nand was monitored with the Swift/X-Ray Telescope (XRT).\nInterestingly, the source flux did not decline during the next\nseveral hours, as is usually the trend with GRBs. This unusual\nbehaviour and the source location near the Galactic bulge indicated that it might not be a GRB but a new Galactic source\n(Kahn 2010). Later that day, the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image\n(MAXI) team reported the detection of a new hard X-ray transient, MAXI J1659\u2212152, whose position was consistent with\nGRB 100925A and which had brightened since 2010 September\n25 02:30 UTC (Negoro et al. 2010). The discovery initiated\nseveral multi-wavelength observations (ground and space-based;\ne.g., van der Horst et al. 2010, Kuulkers et al. 2010b, 2010c; see\nalso Kuulkers et al. 2012a).\nThe Galactic origin of MAXI J1659\u2212152 was also suggested\nthe next day from a combined UV-X-ray spectral-energy distribution analysis using data from the Swift/XRT and Swift/UV\nOptical Telescope (UVOT) (Xu 2010). Finally, optical spectroscopy data taken with the ESO/Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nX-shooter instrument showed various broad emission lines from\nthe Balmer and Paschen series of H and of He II, as well as Ca II\nand Na I absorption lines from the interstellar medium, all at redshift zero, clinching the Galactic nature of the source. Moreover,\nthe double-peaked profiles of the emission lines indicated that\nthe source was an X-ray binary (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2010,\nKaur et al. 2012). The binary nature of the source has by now\nbeen established in several studies of its spectral and temporal properties. Kennea et al. (2010) reported frequent intensity\ndrops in the X-ray light curve, attributed possibly to eclipses\nby a companion star. Kuulkers et al. (2010d, 2012a) established a period of \u223c2.42 hr using the X-ray Multi Mirror mission\n(XMM-Newton) data, which was later confirmed by Belloni et al.\n(2010, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE); also Kuulkers et\nal. 2012a) and Kennea et al. (2011; Swift). Kuroda et al. (2010)\nhave reported optical variations up to 0.1 mag, consistent with\na double-peaked modulation at a period of 2.4158\u00b10.0003 hrs.\nWe concluded that this is the shortest BHXB orbital period measured as yet (Kuulkers et al. 2010d, 2012a), and suggested that\nthe source was most likely viewed at a high inclination (Kuulkers\net al. 2012a).\nThe source was identified as a BHXB through the fast timing\nbehaviour observed with the RXTE/Proportional Counter Array\n(PCA), which was similar to that seen in stellar-mass black-hole\ntransients (Kalamkar et al. 2011, Kennea et al. 2011, Mu\u00f1ozDarias et al. 2011b, Shaposhnikov et al. 2012, Yamaoka et al.\n2012). Estimates of the mass of the compact object range from\n2.2\u20133.1 M\u2299 (Kennea et al. 2011), to 3.6\u20138.0 M\u2299 (Yamaoka et al.\n2012), to 20\u00b13 M\u2299 (Shaposhnikov et al. 2012). Part of the discrepancy can be resolved by taking into account the spin of the\nblack hole (Kennea et al. 2011, Yamaoka et al. 2012). The source\ndistance estimates range between 1.6\u22124.2 kpc (Miller-Jones et\nal. 2011) and 8.6 kpc (Yamaoka et al. 2011).\nAfter the main outburst, MAXI J1659\u2212152 continued to\nshow low-level activity (e.g., Kennea et al. 2011). The flux\nof MAXI J1659\u2212152 was observed to exhibit sudden intensity\nchanges, e.g., during 2011 May, when Swift and Chandra detected a reflare. The source then decayed again over a period of\n\u223c2 months (Yang & Wijnands 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, Jonker et\nal. 2012). It seemed to enter its quiescent state during the second\nhalf of 2011 (Yang & Wijnands 2011d, Russell et al. 2011, Kong\net al. 2011). However, for a BHXB it was still too bright to be in\ntrue quiescence (Jonker et al. 2012). A possible quiescent optical counterpart has been reported based on observations done on\n2010 June 19 (about 3 months before the start of the outburst)\nand 2012 March 23 (Kong et al. 2010, Kong 2012).\n\nOur team was involved in various Target of Opportunity\n(ToO) observations taken with RXTE, Swift and XMM-Newton.\nHere we present a detailed account of the X-ray and UV light\ncurves of MAXI J1659\u2212152, taken over the course of the 2010\noutburst with these satellites and with MAXI. A preliminary\naccount of the results can be found in Kuulkers et al. (2010b,\n2010d, 2012a) and Belloni et al. (2010). The MAXI, RXTE and\nSwift data have already been (partly) described elsewhere, however, the focus was more on the combined spectral and timing\nbehaviour of MAXI J1659\u2212152 (Kalamkar et al. 2011, Kennea\net al. 2011, Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. 2011b, Shaposhnikov et al.\n2012, Yamaoka et al. 2012). We find that MAXI J1659\u2212152 is\nindeed viewed at a high inclination. It still has the shortest orbital period known to date, and is, therefore, a rather compact\nBHXB transient. We present in Sect. 2 a detailed description of\nthe data sets used in our analysis, and in Sect. 3 the results of our\ntiming analysis of the variations of the source light curve. We\ndiscuss the observed light curve dips in Sect. 4 and provide an\ninterpretation on the characteristics of the binary system and its\ndistance.\n\n2. Observations\nIn this paper we only concentrate on the light curves of the\nvarious instruments onboard MAXI (Matsuoka et al. 2009),\nRXTE (Bradt et al. 1993), Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004) and XMMNewton1 (Jansen et al. 2001). We refer to Table 1 for an observation log of the latter 3 satellites. The XMM-Newton spectral\nanalysis is deferred to a future paper. For a spectral analysis of\nthe RXTE and Swift data we refer to Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. (2011b)\nand Kennea et al. (2011), respectively, as well as Yamaoka et al.\n(2012). All our light curves have been subjected to a barycentric\ncorrection using the standard tools available.\n2.1. XMM-Newton\n\nWe used Science Analysis System (SAS) version 11.0.0 together\nwith the latest calibration files to analyse the XMM-Newton data.\nThe European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC)-MOS (Turner et\nal. 2001) cameras were not used during the observation in order to allocate their telemetry to the EPIC-pn camera (Str\u00fcder\net al. 2001) and to avoid full scientific buffer in the latter. The\nEPIC-pn was used in timing mode, whilst the Reflection Grating\nSpectrometer instruments (RGS1 and RGS2; den Herder et al.\n2001) were operating in the standard spectroscopy mode. Due to\nthe brightness of the source the EPIC-pn data were affected by\npile-up (see below). Similarly, the count rate was also above the\nlimits of pile-up for the RGS2, for which the read-out is slower\nby a factor of two compared to that of RGS1 since August 2007\n(see section 3.4.4.8 of the XMM-Newton Users Handbook).\nStandard data reduction procedures (SAS tasks epproc and\nrgsproc) were used to obtain EPIC-pn and RGS calibrated\nevent files. We used the task epfast on the event files to correct\nfor charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) effects seen in the EPIC-pn\ntiming mode when high count rates are present.\nThe count rate in the EPIC-pn was close to, or above, the\n800 cts s\u22121 level, at which X-ray loading and pile-up effects become significant. Pile-up occurs when more than one photon is\nread in a pixel during a read-out cycle. This causes photon loss,\n1\n\nWe note that the XMM-Newton observations were taken simultaneously with one of the INTEGRAL ToO observations of the source, see\nKuulkers et al. (2012a).\n\n\fE.

We\nused the SAS task epatplot, which utilises the relative ratios\n\nof single- and double-pixel events which deviate from standard\nvalues in case of significant pile-up, as a diagnostic tool in the\npn camera timing mode data and found that the spectrum was\naffected by pile-up. Next, we extracted several spectra selecting\nsingle and double timing mode events (patterns 0 to 4) but different spatial regions for the source. Source events were first extracted from a 62\u2032\u2032 (15 columns) wide box centred on the source\nposition (Region 1). Next we excluded 2,4,6,8 and 10 columns\n\n\f4\n\nE.

We found that the spectrum was free of pile-up after removing the central 10 columns.\nThen, we used this free of pile-up event list to extract the time\nseries shown in this paper.\nIn the case of the RGS, we used table 11 in the XMM-Newton\nUsers Handbook to determine which CCDs were affected by\npile-up. We found that CCDs 6,7 and 8 from RGS2 were above\nthe pile-up limits and, therefore, we did not use them for analysis.\nThe EPIC-pn and RGS time series at 1 s and 100 s time resolution were produced using the epiclccorr and rgslccorr\ntasks, respectively.\nIn the EPIC-pn timing mode, there are no source-free background regions, since the point-spread function of the telescope\nextends further than the central CCD boundaries. In the case of\nRGS, since MAXI J1659\u2212152 was very bright, its spectrum is\nnot significantly modified by the 'real' background which contributes less than 1% to the total count rate in most of the bandwidth. Therefore, we chose not to subtract the 'background' extracted from the outer regions of the central CCD (see also Done\n& Diaz Trigo 2010, Ng et al. 2010).\nThe final RGS light curve was calculated by combining\nRGS1 and RGS2, adding both orders 1 and 2.\nThe optical monitor (OM, Talavera 2009, Mason et al. 2001)\nwas operated in EPIC imaging mode with the two filters UVW1\n(\u03bb\u223c2500\u20133500 \u00c5) and UVM2 (\u03bb\u223c2000\u20132600 \u00c5). Ten consecutive exposures of 4200 s duration each were taken, first five in\nthe UVW1, and then five more in the UVM2 filter. We derived\nthe source magnitudes from the output of standard extraction using the SAS task omichain. In Table 2, the average fluxes and\nmagnitudes in each filter are listed for each of the exposures.\n2.2. RXTE\n\nRXTE monitored the source more than once daily throughout the\noutburst (see Kalamkar et al. 2011, Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. 2011b,\nShaposhnikov et al. 2012, Yamaoka et al. 2012). We used 64\nPCA (Jahoda et al. 2006) observations from 2010 September 28\nto November 8 (see Table 1); the total good-time exposure was\nabout 138 ks.\nFor the PCA data we used the FTOOLS analysis suite (version 6.9). We produced light curves from PCU2 with 16-s bins\nover the full PCA energy range (using Standard 1 data), i.e.,\n2\u201360 keV, and over three energy ranges, i.e., 2.1\u20134.9 keV, 4.9\u2013\n9.8 keV and 9.8\u201319.8 keV (using Standard 2 data). We applied\n\nthe standard selection criteria for bright sources in our analysis. We included data when the elevation angle of the source\nabove the Earth horizon was more than 10\u25e6 , and used only stable pointings, i.e., those with offset angles less than 0.02\u25e6. The\nlight curves were corrected for background, as estimated from\nthe background model for bright sources.\n2.3. Swift\n\nWe utilised the methods described by Evans et al. (2009) to\nextract XRT (Hill et al. 2004, Burrows et al. 2005) X-ray\nlight curves in the energy range 0.3\u201310 keV, with corrections\nfor the effects of pile-up, hot-columns and hot-pixels applied.\nThese light curves, at 100 s time resolution, were extracted using the most accurate available localisation in the XRT coordinate system, derived from late-time PC mode data taken\non 2011 February 6, 134 days after the initial detection of\nMAXI J1659\u2212154, when the source was not affected by pile-up\n(Kennea et al. 2011). We used the XRT/WT light curves between\n2010 September 25 and October 22 (see Table 1), whenever the\npointing offset was smaller than about 3.5\u2032 . This led to a total\ngood-time exposure of about 123 ksec.\nWe used the BAT (Barthelmy et al. 2005) 15\u201350 keV light\ncurves (see Krimm et al. 2006)2 generated on 2011 October 25.\nWe did not use time bins with less than 500 s exposure time (see\nKennea et al. 2011).\n2.4. MAXI\n\nThe Gas Slit Camera (GSC; Mihara et al. 2011) is part of the\npayload of the MAXI mission, onboard the International Space\nStation (ISS). Only those data (version 0.3) when the instrument\nwas operating at a high voltage of 1650 V were taken into account. In this paper we only focus on the light curves averaged\nover an ISS orbit and on a daily basis, in the total 2\u201320 keV\nband.3\n\n3. Results\nThe main outburst light curve of MAXI J1659\u2212152 has already\nbeen shown in various papers, as well as a multitude of energy range and time resolution combinations. Authors also used\ndifferent combinations of instruments. We refer to Kalamkar\net al. (2011), Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. (2011b) and Shaposhnikov\net al. (2012) for the RXTE/PCA light curves of the averages\nper observation, in various X-ray bands. Yamaoka et al. (2012)\nshowed the RXTE/PCA data at a time resolution of 16 s in various X-ray bands. Kalamkar et al. (2011) and Yamaoka et al.\n(2012) also show the one-day averaged MAXI/GSC light curves.\nAdditionally, the latter authors provided the daily-averaged\nSwift/BAT data. Kennea et al. (2011) showed the Swift/BAT data\non a satellite orbit time scale, together with the Swift/XRT rates\nat a 100 s time resolution. Both Kalamkar et al. (2011) and\nShaposhnikov et al. (2012) provided daily hardness averages\nbased on the RXTE/PCA data, whilst Kennea et al. (2011) provided hardness curves during the outburst using the Swift/XRT\ndata.\nWe here present an overview of the outburst behaviour, combining the information at soft and hard energies, as well as\n2\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/transients/\nindex.html\n3\nhttp://maxi.riken.jp\n\n\fE.

Dipping\nactivity is clearly apparent on a regular basis.\n\nat various time resolutions. We first describe the overall outburst light curve and then focus on two independent intensity\nvariations seen, i.e., 'absorption dips' and 'transition dips'. We\nsubsequently present a timing study of the data taken during\nthe time period when absorption dips were seen. We use days\nsince MJD 55464 to describe the epoch of time. This date is\nclose to the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT triggers of the outburst\n(MJD 55464.10 and 55464.34, respectively, see Sect. 1).\n3.1. Overall outburst light curve\n\nIn the top panel of Fig. 1 we show the overall outburst light\ncurve of MAXI J1659\u2212152, using daily averages, at relatively\nsoft energies (2\u201320 keV; Fig. 1a) and hard energies (15\u201350 keV;\nFig. 1b). After a fast rise of a couple of days, MAXI J1659\u2212152's\nsoft intensity fluctuates by 20\u201330% on a daily basis (see also\nKalamkar et al. 2011), on top of a general slow decline in intensity (\u223c0.1 cts cm\u22122 s\u22121 per 10 days), up to about day 30. It then\nshows an exponential-like decay (with a decay constant of of\n\u223c7 days) up to about day 100. In the hard energy band (Fig. 1b),\nMAXI J1659\u2212152 reaches a peak in intensity within 3 days after\nthe start. It subsequently decreases in a somewhat irregular fashion (but smoother than with respect to the soft energy band),\nuntil about day 65 (see also Kennea et al. 2011). After days\n100 and 65, MAXI J1659\u2212152 falls below the detection limits\nof MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT, respectively. In Fig. 1a we have\nalso indicated the times of the post main-outburst X-ray observations with Swift and Chandra, as well as radio observations, as\nreported in the literature (Kennea et al. 2011, Yang et al. 2011a,\n2011b, Yang & Wijnands 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, MillerJones et al. 2011, Jonker et al. 2012).\nIn the middle panel of Fig. 1 we zoom in on the main part\nof the outburst, from just before the start of the outburst up to\nthe part when MAXI J1659\u2212152 was too close to the Sun to be\nobserved during dedicated pointed observations with RXTE and\nSwift.\nFig. 1c shows the outburst as seen by the RXTE/PCA in its\nwhole sensitive energy band (2\u201360 keV), at a 16 s time resolution. The variability during an observation in the first part of\n\n5\n\nthe main outburst and up to before the soft X-ray peak of the\nmain outburst (i.e., up to about day 10, which we denote outburst epoch A) is mainly due to periodic dips in the light curves,\nwhich will be described in more detail in the next subsection,\nSect. 3.2.1. From before the peak of the outburst up to about day\n22 (outburst epoch B), variability within an observation is still\nseen, albeit less strong. This variability is due to flaring during\nthe observations (see, e.g., Fig. 5c). During outburst epoch B the\naverage flux varies between 15\u201320% from observation to observation (see also Kalamkar et al. 2011). On days 22\u201331.5 (outburst epoch C), apart from a general decreasing trend, the intensity appears to be varying between a low and a high value. Flux\nvariations on a similar scale are seen within three observations\nof that period (days 23.7, 24.0 and 26.1, see Sect. 3.2.2). The\nlast part of the main outburst (days 30.5\u201344.1; outburst epoch D)\nshows a rather smooth, but not linear or power-law/exponential\nlike (see below), decay. We note that the observations during\noutburst epoch D have only a relatively short duration (see Table\n1); they exhibit no strong variability like that seen in the earlier\noutburst epochs.\n\nIn Figs. 1d and e the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT light\ncurves of the outburst are presented, integrated over a satellite orbit. We note that the Swift/XRT (and Swift/UVOT, see\nKennea et al. 2011) coverage was up to day 27.3 (see Table 1\nand Kennea et al. 2011). The difference in rise time to maximum between the soft and hard energy band, noted above, can\nbe clearly seen. This is also borne out by the hardness curve\nshown in Fig. 1f: just after discovery, the outburst is hard, and\nthen softens during the following week (see also Kennea et al.\n2011, using Swift/XRT). Near the end of the main outburst,\ni.e., around day 35, MAXI J1659\u2212152's radiation hardens again\n(see also Kalamkar et al. 2011, Shaposhnikov et al. 2012, using\nRXTE/PCA). The end of the main outburst is well covered by\nthe MAXI/GSC (see also above), and, as noted earlier, it shows a\nsmooth, power-law/exponential like decay in the 2\u201320 keV band.\nThe hardening around day 35 and the fact that RXTE/PCA is\nsensitive to hard (&20 keV) X-rays causes the RXTE/PCA light\ncurve to deviate from the power-law/exponential like decay described at softer X-rays (.20 keV).\n\nBetween about days 18 and 28, the MAXI/GSC and\nSwift/BAT intensities seem to modulate on a several day time\nscale (Figs. 1d and e). Before and after this time period this is\nnot evident. A closer look at the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT light\ncurves (Fig. 1g and h) shows a possible periodic variation on an\nabout 3-day time scale, for about 3 cycles. Indeed, a pure linear trend does not describe the data well in this time period:\n\u03c72red = 3.3 for 81 degrees of freedom (dof) and \u03c72red = 2.1 for\n123 dof, for the MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT light curves, respectively. Adding a quadratic term does not significantly improve\nthe situation (\u03c72red = 3.4 for 80 dof and 1.8 for 122 dof, respectively). A sinusoidal plus constant, linear and quadratic term\ndoes significantly improve the fit, although it is still not ideal\n(\u03c72red = 2.2 for 77 dof and \u03c72red = 1.3 for 119 dof, respectively).\nThe modulation may thus be not purely sinusoidal. Assuming\nthe signal is real, we derive a period of 3.15\u00b10.05 days (uncertainty is determined by using \u2206\u03c72 = 1) in the Swift/XRT light\ncurve and 3.04\u00b10.09 days in the Swift/BAT, i.e., consistent with\neach other. The phase of the sinusoid is about 0.25 days earlier\nfor the Swift/BAT with respect to that of the MAXI/GSC.\n\n\f6\n\nE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\n3.2. Recurrent intensity variations\n\n4\n\nNote that the differences in the numbers are due to the different\ninstruments used for the curves, RXTE/PCA in Fig. 5g and XMMNewton/EPIC-pn in figure 4 of Boirin et al. (2005).\n\n100\n\ncts s\u22121\n\na\n0\n\n27/9/2010\n\n2.89\n2.9\nTime (MJD \u2212 55464)\n\n100\n\n200\n\n2.88\n\ncts s\u22121\n\nb\n\n27\u221228/9/2010\n\n0\n\nPeriodic drops of intensity, or dips, are observed shortly after\nthe start of the outburst, at day 0.3, up to day 8.2, first in the\nSwift/XRT light curves (e.g., Fig. 2, days 0.3\u20132.6, Fig. 3b, day\n3.3), then in the XMM-Newton/RGS and EPIC-pn light curves\n(Fig. 3c and d, days 2.7\u20133.3), and finally in the RXTE/PCA\ncurves (e.g., Fig. 3a, days 3.0\u20133.4 and Fig. 5a, day 7.1). A clear\nrecurrence time of \u22430.1 days is best observed in the XMMNewton/RGS and EPIC-pn light curves, thanks to the continuous coverage. In addition to the periodic dips, a linear rise in\nthe out-of-dip intensity is observed in the Swift/XRT light curve\n(Fig. 2; see also Kennea et al. 2011), which extends throughout\nthe XMM-Newton observations (Fig. 3c and d) and is consistent with the MAXI/GSC light curve (Fig. 1d), where the source\nreached its first plateau at soft X-rays, .20 keV, around day 4\n(i.e., just after the XMM-Newton observations).\nThe dips show irregular structure which lasts between about\n5 and 40 min. Occasionally, the XMM-Newton/RGS and EPICpn light curves show shallower dip activity at half the recurrence\ntime (see, e.g., Figs. 3c and d near day 3.15). The depth of the\ndips varies between \u224390% and 50% of the average out-of-dipinterval intensity in the light curves of Swift/XRT and XMMNewton/RGS and EPIC-pn (Figs. 2 and 3), extracted with a time\nresolution of 100 s.\nIn Fig. 4 we show two epochs of the dip activity at a higher\ntime resolution of 1 s as seen by the XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn. The\ntwo epochs are one dip-cycle apart, i.e., about 0.1 day. Clearly,\nthe dip morphology changes from cycle to cycle. Fast dipping\nactivity is observed, which can last up to 30 min. These fast dips\nhave a duration of .30 s, and often as small as 1 s. Occasionally,\nbefore and/or after the fast dips the intensity reaches the persistent level seen outside the dipping intervals. During the fast\ndips the intensity can drop down to about 15% of the persistent\nintensity, indicating that the shallower dips observed in Fig. 3\nare a consequence of averaging a smaller number of fast dips in\ncoarser time bins.\nNext, we examine the hardness values of the XMMNewton/EPIC-pn (Fig. 3e) and RXTE/PCA (see Fig. 5) light\ncurves. The hardness ratio is defined as the ratio of the count\nrates in the 2\u201310 keV to the 0.6\u20132 keV bands for the EPIC-pn\ndata, and 4.9\u20139.8 keV to the 2.1\u20134.9 keV bands for the PCA data.\nDuring the dips the source hardens. This colour behaviour during dips is also confirmed by the Swift/XRT data (see Kennea et\nal. 2011). We observe in particular a stronger hardening as the\ndip becomes deeper. As the out-of-dip intensity increases, the\ndipping becomes shallower and the changes in the hardness ratio less pronounced (see Figs. 5a and b). This is shown in more\ndetail in Fig. 5g, where we plot the changes of hardness ratio\nas a function of count rate. The shape of the curve traced by the\nPCA data from day 7.1 to 9.1 to 12.7 is remarkably similar to the\nshape of the curve shown in figure 4 of Boirin et al. (2005) for the\nclassical LMXB dipper 4U 1323\u221262 as the source moves from\ndeep dipping to shallow dipping and finally to a persistent state.4\nUsing the absorption dip activity ephemeris from Sect. 3.3, we\nfind that the dips recur at phase 0.4\u20130.6 (see, e.g., Fig. 5a\u2013f).\nSince the dip morphology and hardness behaviour resembles\nthe dip phenomenon encountered in various high-inclination X-\n\n200\n\n3.2.1.

Zoom in from Fig. 3d on the XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn\n(0.2\u201315 keV) light curves around the time of dip activity around\nday 2.9 (a) and 3.0 (b), respectively. The time resolution is 1 s.\nAll data with a fractional exposure of more than 0.5 per bin are\nshown.\nray binaries (Sect. 4.1.1), we refer to these dips as 'absorption\ndips'.\nWe note that UV data simultaneous to the XMMNewton/EPIC-pn data are available from the XMM-Newton/OM\n(see Fig. 3f). Although the UV is variable, there does not seem\nto be a correlation with X-ray intensity, in particular with the Xray dipping. Unfortunately, however, the time resolution is too\ncoarse to investigate in detail the UV light curve on the X-ray\ndip structure time scale. Therefore, we do not discuss the UV\ndata any further.\n3.2.2. Transition dips\n\nOn three occasions (days 23.7, 24.0 and 26.1; see Fig. 6), the\nX-ray light curves show further pronounced variations. The\nRXTE/PCA light curve on day 23.7 (Fig. 6a) resembles that seen\nduring observations with absorption dips. However, the hardness\n(Fig. 6d, g) correlates with the X-ray intensity, in contrast to the\nabsorption dips. The RXTE/PCA light curves on days 24.0 and\n26.1 (Fig. 6b and c) show the presence of two intensity levels\nwhich differ by about 30%, between which the source fluctuates. The transitions are fast, i.e., they occur within tenths of\nseconds. The time spent in the upper level is about 1\u20132 min on\n\n\fE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nday 24.0 and at least 6\u201314 min on day 26.1. The time spent in the\nlower level is about 12 to at least 20 min on day 24.0 and about\n26 min on day 26.1. These light curves have been referred to as\n'flip-flop' light curves (see Kalamkar et al. 2011). However, the\nintensity fluctuations correspond to fast source state transitions\n(see Sect. 4.1.2), so we refer to them as 'transition dips'. The intensity variations seen during the transition dips are more or less\nof the same order as the variations in the average intensity from\nobservation to observation in outburst epoch C (see Fig. 1 and\nSect. 3.1; see also Kalamkar et al. 2011). Contrary to Kalamkar\net al. (2011), we find clear hardness changes during the transition dips light curves (Fig. 6e and f). The hardness behaviour is\nsimilar to that seen on day 23.7, again opposite to that seen during the absorption dip episodes, i.e., the source is harder at the\nupper intensity level, and softens when the source transits to the\nlower level (Figs. 6h and i).\nAlthough the phasing5 of the transition dips on day 26.1\nis consistent with the phasing of the absorption dips (see\nSect. 3.2.1), the phasing of the transition dips on days 23.7 and\n24.0 is clearly not. Observations in between days 24.0 and 26.1\ndo not show any dipping behaviour (even between phase 0.4 and\n0.6), and indicate that the transition dips do not recur with the\n0.1 day time scale.\n3.3. Timing analysis of absorption dip activity\n\nThe Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and RGS, and\nRXTE/PCA data indicate that the absorption dips occur\nregularly, i.e., about every \u223c0.1 day (Sect. 3.2.1), from the start\nof the main outburst up to about day 10 (outburst epoch A, see\nSect. 3.1). In LMXB dippers (Sect. 4.1.1) absorption dips recur\nwith the orbital period. Using our rather large time base line we\ncan establish an accurate period of the recurring dip activity in\nMAXI J1659\u2212152.\nWe performed a Lomb-Scargle (LS; Lomb 1976, Scargle\n1982) period search, as well as a Phase Dispersion Minimisation\n(PDM; Stellingwerf 1978) period search, on our data sets taken\nduring outburst epoch A. The datasets of each instrument were\ntreated separately. The LS and PDM searches were done over\nthe period range 0.01\u20130.5 days, with a frequency interval of\n0.001 day\u22121 . For the PDM search we used 20 phase bins with\na phase bin width of 0.056. In the LS periodogram a peak indicates a dominating period in the data set, whilst in a PDM\nperiodogram a minimum indicates a dominating period.\nThe error on a period found was computed by constructing 1000 synthesised data sets. These data sets were obtained\nby distributing each data point around its observed value, by an\namount given by its error bar multiplied by a number output by\na Gaussian random-number generator with zero mean and unit\nvariance. The measured standard deviation of the positions of\nthe deepest minima in \u0398 or highest peak in power in the resulting periodograms was taken as the error. These latter periodograms were done in a narrow range around \u22430.1 day, i.e.,\nbetween 0.0909 and 0.1111 days, with a frequency interval of\n0.00009 days.\nTo check the significance of the peaks and minima found\nin the LS and PDM diagrams, respectively, we randomised the\ndata and calculated the resulting periodogram. The randomisa5\nBy folding the data on the recurrence time of the absorption dip\nactivity, \u22430.1 day (see Sects. 3.2.1 and 3.3).\n6\nThe choice of number of phase bins and phase bin width is rather\narbitrary; tests with various numbers of phase bins and different phase\nbin width yielded consistent results.\n\n7\n\ntion was done by keeping the time tags and randomly distributing the intensities of the data sets which were input to the periodogram programs. This was repeated 1000 times and the resulting averaged periodogram was used to evaluate the significance\nof the peaks/minima. We find that the values of the power (LS)\nor amplitude \u0398 (PDM) are narrowly distributed around 1 for all\nperiods investigated: the variances are 1 for the LS values of all\nthe instruments, and 0.001, 0.001, 0.002 and 0.007 for the PDM\nvalues of the RGS, EPIC-pn, XRT and PCA, respectively. We\nrefer to this level as the noise level.\nAnother way to characterise the uncertainty in the period,\nwhich is more conservative, is to use the width of the peak or\nminimum of the periodograms, e.g., the half-width at half maximum or minimum (HWHM).\nThe results for the different instruments are discussed in the\nnext subsections, and a summary of the best-found periods near\n0.1 days with their associated errors is given in Table 3. We find,\nthat the HWHM values are a factor of 25\u2013200 times larger than\nthose derived by the measured standard deviations of the positions of the peaks or minima, as described above. Since the\nspread in the best-found periods is of the order of the HWHM\nvalues, we use these values as a final indicator of the uncertainty\nin the derived periods.\n3.3.1. XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and RGS\n\nWe used the EPIC-pn and the RGS data with 100 s time resolution. The highest peak in the LS periodograms is at a period near\n0.1 day (top two left panels of Fig. 7), i.e., 0.1004\u00b10.0090 days\nand 0.1010\u00b10.0071 days, respectively, for the EPIC-pn and RGS\ndata sets. Three deep minima are visible in the RGS and EPICpn PDM periodograms, near 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 days (top two right\npanels of Fig. 7). The deepest minimum is not at the best period\nfound with the LS search, however.\nInspection of the folded light curves on the three periods\nfound with the PDM, reveals that only when folding the data on\nthe \u22430.1 day period is the absorption dip activity (i.e., at count\nrates .140 c s\u22121 and .75 c s\u22121 for the EPIC-pn and RGS, respectively) clustered within 0.2 in phase space. For the other two\nperiods, the same absorption dip activity is distributed along all\nphases. This strengthens our conclusion that the fundamental period is near 0.1 days, since absorption dip activity is expected to\noccur at restricted orbital phases (see Sect. 4.1.1).\n3.3.2. Swift/XRT\n\nA LS and PDM search on the XRT data during outburst epoch\nA did not reveal any significant period, except for the satellite\norbital period around the Earth (see below). This we attribute\nto the variation in intensity of the overall main outburst light\ncurve, which is of the same order as the drops in intensity during\nthe absorption dips (see Fig. 2 and Kennea et al. 2011). The increase in the out-of-dip intensity is rather gradual during the first\n6 days. Thereafter, the out-of-dip light curve varies irregularly on\na time scale of days. We, therefore, first detrended the data using\na multi-order polynomial (see also Kennea et al. 2011); a thirdorder polynomial describes the overall out-of-dip light curve up\nto about outburst day 6 sufficiently well. Including data after day\n6 contaminated our period search significantly, and had the effect of diminishing the peak and minima in our LS and PDM\nsearches, respectively, near 0.1 day. We, therefore, use these data\nonly up to day 6, in the remainder of this subsection.\n\n\f3.3.3. RXTE/PCA\n\nThe overall variability of the PCA data (see Sect 3.1 and Fig. 1c),\nprevented the LS and PDM periodograms to show any significant\npeaks or minima, respectively, except at the satellite orbital period around the Earth (see below). Detrending the PCA data as\ndone for the XRT did not improve our period searches, however.\nThis is due to the fact that the PCA data sampling (as well as the\nenergy range) is different from that of the XRT data. Moreover,\nthere are significant day-to-day variations in the average out-ofdip PCA intensity, which cannot be described by a simple polynomial. We, therefore, renormalised the PCA light curves during\nthe whole outburst epoch A in our search for periodicities. For\neach observation interval (generally corresponding to an RXTE\nsatellite orbit) we determined the mean count rate. This value\nwas subtracted from the light curves corresponding to each of\nthese observation intervals.\nThe lowest minimum in the PDM periodogram is at a period of 0.10058\u00b10.00022 days (Fig. 7, bottom right). A PDM\nsearch in three energy bands (2\u20135 keV, 5\u201310 keV and 10\u201320 keV,\nsee Sect. 2.2) shows the deepest minima at the same period (see\nTable 3). Again, the period quoted above does not coincide with\nthe strong peak at about 0.065 days in the FT of the PCA window\nfunction (Fig. 8, bottom panel).\nA LS search on the PCA data did not reveal a peak near\n\u22430.1 day period, nor near any of the other periods found in the\n7\nWe note that the period reported by Kennea et al. (2011),\n0.1008\u00b10.0037 days, was determined using the LS search on the detrended first 12.8 days of the XRT/WT data. Their error in the period is derived by fitting a Gaussian to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram\naround the peak, and taking a value of 2.7\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the width of the\nGaussian.\n\n0.2\n\nXRT window\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\npower\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nPCA window\n\n0\n\nThe highest peak in the LS periodogram is at\n0.1003\u00b10.0010 days (see Fig. 7, left panel).7 Several minima are found in the PDM periodogram (Fig. 7, right panel),\nincluding those seen at the same periods as in the PDM periodograms of the XMM-Newton data (Sect. 3.3.1). The minimum\nat 0.1005\u00b10.0010 days is clearly not the dominant period in this\nPDM search. However, inspection of the folded light curves on\nthe various periods with peaks or minima in the LS and PDM\nsearches, respectively, show that, again, only for the period near\n0.1 day, the dip activity is clustered within 0.2 in phase space,\nas expected for absorption dips (see Sect. 4.1.1).\nWe note that performing the period search after renormalising the XRT data in a similar manner as we did for the RXTE\ndata (see Sect. 3.3.3) did not reveal significant power at the above\nreported periods. This is because the XRT observations were in\ngeneral shorter than the RXTE/PCA, resulting in averages which\nare higher when there is a dipping period, and therefore the variations due to dipping are diminished.\nTo inspect whether the fundamental period is related to the\ndata sampling (such as due to the satellite orbit), we constructed\na Fourier transform (FT) of the window function. This window\nfunction was determined by setting the intensities of the time\nseries to zero. For the FT we used the same frequency settings\nas the LS and PDM searches. The largest peak in the FT periodogram is evidently at the satellite orbit period around the\nEarth of about 0.067 days (Fig. 8, top). Thus our best period is\nnot related to any peak in the FT periodogram, and can thus be\nconsidered to be intrinsic to the source (see also Kennea et al.\n2011).\n\n0.4\n\nE.

Recurrence period of dipping activity\n\nThe XMM-Newton and XRT LS period searches and the\nPCA PDM period search reveal one common best period,\ni.e., \u223c0.1 day, with peaks/minima in the periodograms well\nabove/below the noise level. Inspection of the individual light\ncurves of the various instruments, and the folding of the data\non the \u22430.1 day period leading to restricted phase range of dipping (see below), supports the main period to be at that value.\nWe attribute the peaks/minima at half this period in the XMMNewton periodograms to the intermediate dipping episodes seen.\nThe peaks/minima at multiple times the above quoted period are\ndue to the fact that the morphology of the dipping changes from\ncycle to cycle, as well as the fact that not all dipping periods are\nsampled well enough.\nThe RXTE/PCA provides the strongest constraint on the\nperiod. We, therefore, conclude that the fundamental period\nof dipping activity is at 0.10058\u00b10.00022 days. We arbitrarily\nset the zero point of the absorption dip activity ephemeris to\nthe first data point of the first RXTE/PCA observation at day\n3.0. Therefore, the absorption dip activity ephemeris is T 0 =\nMJD 55467.039561+0.10058(22)\u00d7E, where E is the cycle number of the period.\n8\n\nThe highest peak in the LS periodogram is at 0.0335 days. However,\nfolding the data at this period reveals the absorption dips to be distributed along all phases.\n\n\fE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\n9\n\nTable 3.

Discussion\n4.1. Origin of intensity variations\n4.1.1. Absorption dips\n\nWe find regular absorption dips in the X-ray light curves during\nthe outburst of MAXI J1659\u2212152 between outburst days 0.3 and\n8.2. Absorption dips recur at the orbital period of the system and\nare thought to be caused by obscuration by material located in a\nthickened outer region ('bulge') of the accretion disk due to its\ninteraction with the inflowing gas stream from the companion\n(e.g., White & Swank 1982, Walter et al. 1982; see discussion\nbelow). The presence of absorption dips allows a precise measurement of the orbital period and is a signature of high inclination (e.g., White & Swank 1982, White & Mason 1985; see also\nD\u0131\u0301az Trigo et al. 2009).\nWe determine the recurrence period of the dips to be\n2.414\u00b10.005 hrs (see also Kuulkers et al. 2012a, Kennea et al.\n2011). By analogy with other classical dippers, we identify this\nperiod with the orbital period of a system. The fastest revolving\nbinary was Swift J1753.5\u22120127 (3.2443 hrs; Zurita et al. 2008,\nDurant et al. 2009). As suggested by Kuulkers et al. (2010d,\n2012a), if the compact object in MAXI J1659\u2212152 is indeed a\nblack hole (Kalamkar et al. 2011, Kennea et al. 2011, Mu\u00f1ozDarias et al. 2011b, Shaposhnikov et al. 2012, Yamaoka et al.\n2012), its \u22432.4 hrs period is the shortest among the currently\nknown BHXB sample (see, e.g., Ritter & Kolb 2003).9\n9\nA possible exception may be Swift J1357.2\u22120933, based on an indirect estimate of the orbital period of 2 hr by Casares et al. (2011). We\n\nLS\nerror\n(days)\n0.000098\n0.000190\n0.000011\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nHWHM\n(days)\n0.0071\n0.0090\n0.0010\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nWe constrain the inclination of MAXI J1659\u2212152 to be between about 65\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 from the presence of the periodic absorption dips, due to material in the line of sight that obscures up\nto about 90% of the total emission at given cycles, and the absence of eclipses. We base the lower limit on the size of the bulge\n(and not on the disk opening angle which has been generally estimated to be \u224312\u25e6 , e.g., de Jong et al. 1996, Bayless et al. 2010).\nWhite & Holt (1982) estimated the size of the bulge responsible for absorption dips as 19\u25e6 \u00b16\u25e6 for the LMXB 4U 1822\u221237.\nTaking this as typical for LMXBs, we can thus set a lower limit\non the inclination of 65\u25e6 . We note that, if the accretion disk is\ntilted or warped, the lower limit for the inclination could be as\nlow as 55\u25e6 , taking into account that for generic LMXBs, a disk\ntilt of about 10\u25e6 is expected (Foulkes et al. 2010). An upper\nlimit for the inclination of 80\u25e6 is derived from the absence of\neclipses (e.g., Horne 1985), the spectral type of the companion\nstar (M5V, see Sect. 4.2.1), and the fact that the companion is\nfilling its Roche lobe (see, e.g., Motch et al. 1987). Here we are\nassuming that the source of emission is point-like (for an extended source one would not be able to see full eclipses for any\nof the LMXBs).\nThe absorption dips in MAXI J1659\u2212152 share many of the\nproperties of classical absorption dipping systems. They change\nfrom period to period, they are fast, and the obscuration can\nbe large, i.e., down to about 90% of the total intensity (see,\ne.g., White & Mason 1985, Parmar & White 1988). Boirin et\nal. (2005) and D\u0131\u0301az Trigo et al. (2006) were able to model the\nchanges in both the narrow X-ray absorption features and the\ncontinuum during the dips from all the bright dipping LMXBs\nobserved by XMM-Newton by an increase in the column density\nand a decrease in the amount of ionisation of a photo-ionised\nabsorbing plasma. The changes in the hardness ratio observed\nin the dips in MAXI J1659\u2212152 are consistent with absorption\nby neutral and photo-ionised plasma, in the sense that they are\nenergy dependent. A further support to the existence of neutral\nand photo-ionised plasma is the presence of various stages of\ndipping: persistent, shallow and deep dipping states. The fact\nnote, however, that the outburst amplitude in the optical (\u223c6 mag, Rau et\nal. 2011) is incompatible with such a short period, based on the empirical relation between the outburst amplitude and orbital period (Shabaz\n& Kuulkers 1998), see also Sect. 4.6. Another short-period binary candidate, MAXI J1305\u2212704, was put forward recently by Kennea et al.\n(2012b). This new transient (Sato et al. 2012) showed absorption dips.\nA periodicity of \u223c1.5 hrs was reported (Kennea et al. 2012b), but this\nwas put into doubt by Kuulkers et al. (2012b). It has been suggested that\nMAXI J1305\u2212704 is a BHXB based on outburst optical amplitude, blue\noptical spectral energy distribution and hard X-ray spectrum (Greiner et\nal. 2012; see also Kennea et al. 2012a), as well as the occurrence of a\nstate transition (Suwa et al. 2012). However, these are features which\nare seen in neutron star LMXBs as well (see Suwa et al. 2012, Kennea\net al. 2012b).\n\n\f10\n\nE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nthat dips become shallower and less energy dependent as the\ncount rate increases could be a consequence of the photo-ionised\nplasma becoming more and more ionised and transparent as it is\nilluminated by the X-rays of the central region. However, we\nnote that a definite confirmation of an increase of neutral and\nionised plasma during dips for MAXI J1659\u2212152 is only possible after spectral analysis.\nAbsorption dipping in other LMXBs occurs mainly around\norbital phase 0.7\u20130.9, where eclipses are expected at phase zero\nif we view the accretion disk edge-on, i.e., when the companion star is closest to us and in front of the neutron star (e.g.,\nParmar & White 1988). Occasionally, absorption dips with a 0.5\nphase difference with respect to the phase at which 'regular dips'\noccur are observed. These 'anomalous dips', or 'secondary absorption dips', were also seen in other dipping systems (such as\nXB 1916\u2212053, e.g., White & Swank 1982, Walter et al. 1982,\nSmale et al. 1988, Boirin et al. 2004). They are explained as\nbeing due to material migrating to the other side after impact\nwith the disk, or the accretion stream partly freely overflowing the disk or bouncing of the disk rim and then overflow (see,\ne.g., Frank et al. 1987, Armitage & Livio 1998, and references\ntherein). In the latter case the flow may impact the disk near\nthe circularisation radius, either causing a second bulge (see,\ne.g., Frank et al. 1987, Armitage & Livio 1998, and references\ntherein) or bouncing of the disk again (Kunze et al. 2001).\nThe absorption dips appear for only part of the outburst\nin MAXI J1659\u2212152. This has been observed already for\nother BHXBs undergoing an outburst, like 4U 1630\u221247 and\nGRO J1655\u221240 (Kuulkers et al. 1998, 2000, Tomsick et al.\n1998). It is plausible that for transient BHXBs, changes in the\naccretion mode cause the appearance or disappearance of dips.\nKuulkers et al. (2000) interpreted the (deep) absorption dips during the rise and plateau phase of the outburst in GRO J1655\u221240\nas due to an absorbing medium which is filamentary in nature.\nThese filaments could be due to the stream of material coming\nfrom the companion star splashing into the accretion disk and\noverflowing above and below the impact region (e.g., Livio et\nal. 1986; see Kuulkers et al. 2000, and references therein). If the\ninclination is high enough, the impact region itself comes also\ninto the line of sight (e.g., Frank et al. 1987). However, the presence of absorption features all around the orbit for neutron stars\n(e.g., Parmar et al. 2002) shows that at least part of the photoionised plasma is distributed equatorially along the whole plane\nof the disk, indicating that absorption is due to a structure in the\ndisk rather than by filaments. In that scenario, the cause for the\ndisappearance of dips in BHXBs could be, e.g., a strong ionisation of the plasma in bright (but hard) states of the outburst,\nwhich renders the plasma transparent and therefore invisible to\nus. Alternatively, a change of the structure of the disk could diminish the thickness of the bulge and cause the absorption dips\nto disappear.\n4.1.2. Transition dips\n\nAs noted by Kalamkar et al. (2011), during the second epoch\nof the outburst rapid and sharp flux variations - transition\ndips - were seen, resembling the 'flip-flop' and 'dip' light\ncurves in, e.g., GX 339\u22124 (Miyamoto et al. 1991), GS 1124\u221268\n(Takizawa et al. 1997) and XTE J1859+226 (Casella et al. 2004).\nIn all these cases 10\u201320% changes in intensity were seen.\nWe find that MAXI J1659\u2212152 softens when the intensity decreases, in contrast to the hardening seen during the absorption dips. In the case of GX 339\u22124 (Miyamoto et al. 1991)\nand XTE J1859+226 (Casella et al. 2004) significant hardness\n\nchanges could be discerned as well, with behaviour similar to\nthat seen for MAXI J1659\u2212152. The clear difference in hardness\nbehaviour of the absorption and transition dips, as well as the\nfact that they occurred in well separated phases of the outburst,\nsuggests that the two phenomena have a different origin.\nThe transition dips in MAXI J1659\u2212152 occurred during the\nfirst soft excursion of the source (see Fig. 10). During this period the count rate differences between consecutive observations\nwere of the same order as the count rate changes seen during the\ntransition dips (with the softer observations having lower count\nrates), suggesting that additional transitions took place between\nobservations.\nIn the other sources in which transitions dips have been seen,\nthe transitions were often accompanied by pronounced changes\nin the power density spectra (Miyamoto et al. 1991, Takizawa\net al. 1997, Homan et al. 2001, Casella et al. 2004). The power\ndensity spectra from the two observations that showed the transitions dips in MAXI J1659\u2212152 (days 24.0 and 26.1) were\nnot of high enough quality to detect significant changes in the\npower-density spectral properties. However, by analysing the averaged power density spectra from the combined high and low\ncount rate levels during the first 'soft excursion', Kalamkar et al.\n(2011) were able to see indications for an additional broad bump\naround 7\u20138 Hz in the power density spectra of the low count rate\nselection. We note that the transitions in other sources often involve so-called 'type B' quasi-periodic oscillations, QPOs, either in the low or high count rate level power density spectra.\nThe broad excess seen by Kalamkar et al. (2011) is too broad to\nbe identified as a type B QPO, and is more likely to be a peaked\nnoise component.\nTransition dips are most likely the result from instabilities\nin the inner accretion flow (see Miyamoto et al. 1991 for an example interpretation), but their exact origin remains unknown.\nThe observations of MAXI J1659\u2212152 do not provide significant new insights into the nature of these instabilities, but they\ndo show that transition dips can also be found in states that are\nslightly softer than those in which they have been observed in\nother sources (i.e., states in which type B QPOs are observed).\nThis trend is very clearly seen in Fig. 10, where the type B QPOs\nall occur within a hardness range of 0.36\u20130.40, whilst all transition dips occur at hardness .0.36.\nAround the time of the occurrence of transition dips we find\nsome marginal evidence for the soft and hard X-ray light curves\nto modulate on a \u22433 day period. We speculate that this period\nmay be related to a disk precession period. Systems with extreme mass ratio's (i.e., q . 0.33), like MAXI J1659\u2212152, are\nvulnerable to a 3:1 orbital resonance within the accretion disk.\nThis causes the disk to be eccentric and to slowly precess on\ntime scales of days to weeks, which may be discernable in the\nlight curves (Whitehurst 1988, Whitehurst & King 1991, Lubow\n1991a,b; see also Haswell et al. 2001). Periodic variations are\nalso foreseen in this model with a period slightly longer than the\norbital period. However, in LMXBs this phenomenon is inclination dependent: in systems with a high orbital inclination only\norbital modulations due to the heated face of the companion star\nare expected (Haswell et al. 2001). This is consistent with the\nfact that the X-ray and optical light curves show the same (orbital) period (see Sect. 1). The transition dips occurred during the\ntime of the \u22433 day modulation. Possibly, the non-axisymmetric\naccretion disk modulates the inner accretion flow, giving rise to\nthe sporadic transition dips in the X-ray light curves.\n\n\fE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\n4.2. Binary system and evolutionary state\n\nUsing various existing empirical relationships one can get an\nidea of the dimensions of the system. To derive uncertainties on\nthe resulting values, where appropriate we randomly distributed\nthe observed values and equation parameters around their values\nusing a Gaussian distribution with width equal to their errors,\nand assumed that all values and parameters are independent.\nThe spread in the resulting values was used as the uncertainty.\nWe note that parts of the discussion in the following subsections\nalready appeared in Kuulkers et al. (2012a) and Kennea et al.\n(2011). We here update various of the values, based on our more\nrefined analysis. We indicate where Kennea et al. (2011) derived\ncomparable properties.\n4.2.1. Mass and radius of the companion star\n4.2.1.1 Unevolved main sequence companions\n\nWe use here only the observed empirical mass-radius relationships for donor stars in Cataclysmic Variable (CV) binaries:\n(i) Using the linear relationship for CV secondaries by Smith\nand Dillon (1998; their equations 9 and 12) we derive the mass\nof the companion, M2 = 0.19 M\u2299 , and its radius, R2 = 0.24 R\u2299 ,\nwith an estimated uncertainty of 0.05 M\u2299 and 0.02 R\u2299 , respectively. (ii) Using the fact that the orbital period of \u22432.4 hr of\nMAXI J1659\u2212152 puts it right in the so-called \"period gap\"\nof CV-binaries, the empirical mass-radius relation for CV\nsecondaries of Knigge et al. (2011; their figure 4) yields a\nvery precise mass estimate of M2 = 0.20 M\u2299 , and a radius of\nR2 = 0.26 R\u2299 with a rather large uncertainty of 0.04 R\u2299 . Since\nboth estimates are fully consistent with each other, and since\nthe mass estimate from Knigge et al.'s relation is very precise,\nwe will adopt the latter values as the real parameters of the\ncompanion star in the system. The mass and radius correspond\nto spectral type M5V if the star would be on the main sequence.\nHowever, it is well known that secondaries in CVs and LMXBs\nare often not precisely on the main sequence, and tend to be a bit\noverluminous for their masses. The fact that the companion here\nis still filling its Roche lobe (as it is transferring mass), whilst its\norbital period is located in the period-gap of CVs implies that\nthe companion is not a normal main sequence star, since in that\ncase it would at that period not be filling its Roche lobe. It must\ntherefore be a nuclearly somewhat evolved star (see below).\n4.2.1.2 Nuclearly evolved stripped companions\n\nIf the companion star was originally much more massive\nand became a nuclearly evolved star, it will now be a stripped\nevolved star. Such a star will be He-rich and will obey a different\nmass-radius relation. We argue here that the companion is\nindeed such a star and started out its life with a mass between\n1.0 and 1.5 M\u2299 , and underwent considerable nuclear evolution.\nThe reasons for this are as follows. Several authors, starting\nwith Pylyser & Savonije (1988), made calculations of the\nevolution of LMXBs driven by the internal evolution of the\ncompanion star in combination with orbital angular momentum\nloss by 'magnetic braking' and gravitational waves (see Pfahl\net al. 2003, for recent evolutionary calculations for LMXBs).\nThis evolution leads to such stripped evolved companion stars.\nThe reason why the companion of MAXI J1659\u2212152 must be\nsuch an evolved star is that its orbital period of \u223c2.4 hr falls\nright in the middle of the 'period gap' of CVs. In CVs with\n\n11\n\na normal H-rich main-sequence companion the mass transfer\nis driven solely by orbital angular momentum loss, due to\nmagnetic braking and gravitation radiation (see, e.g., Howell et\nal. 2001, Knigge et al. 2011). Such systems evolve to shorter\nand shorter orbital periods; when they arrive at the upper edge\nof the period gap, at Porb \u2243 3 hr, they stop transferring matter,\nbecause magnetic braking stops (Spruit & Ritter 1983, Howell\net al. 2001, Knigge et al. 2011). The companion star which was\nsomewhat out of thermal equilibrium then shrinks, the orbit\nalso shrinks - though slower - due to gravitational wave\nlosses. The mass transfer resumes only when the system has\nreached the lower edge of the period gap at about Porb \u2243 2 hr.\nThis type of evolution will hold for all binaries with a low-mass\nmain-sequence companion, regardless whether the accretor is\na white dwarf or a black hole. The fact that the orbital period\nof MAXI J1659\u2212152 falls in the middle of the period gap,\ntherefore, indicates that its companion is not a normal H-rich\nunevolved main-sequence star. It must be a nuclearly evolved\nobject, such as produced by the above mentioned models of\nPylyser & Savonije (1988) and Pfahl et al. (2003). We are sure\nthat in MAXI J1659\u2212152 mass transfer from the companion\nis taking place, because also during quiescence, at least after\nthe outburst, there is some X-ray emission (see Sect. 1). This\nindicates that there is always an accretion disk present in the\nsystem, which implies that mass transfer continues during\nquiescence. The companion must thus be filling its Roche lobe.\nThe outburst of the system is, therefore, most likely due to some\ndisk instability mechanism (e.g., Lasota 2001), and not due to\nsome mass-loss event from a companion that is not filling its\nRoche lobe.\nWe estimate the initial mass of the companion star as follows. For the companion star to become evolved in a Hubble\ntime, its mass must at least have been 1 M\u2299 . On the other hand,\nin order for the system to evolve to a short orbital period when\nits companion is driving mass transfer (partly) by nuclear evolution, its companion star cannot have been more massive than\nabout 1.5 M\u2299 . The reason for this is that, in order to have the\norbital period decrease whilst the companion is evolving, the orbital expansion due to the mass transfer driven by the evolution\nof the companion (transfer from the less massive to the more\nmassive star makes the orbit expand) must be more than compensated by the orbital shrinking due to the orbital angular momentum loss from the system by magnetic braking. In fact, this\nimplies that, the system must have started out with an orbital period below the so-called 'bifurcation period', which is between\n0.5 days and 0.8 days, depending on the system parameters (see\nPylyser & Savonije 1988, Pfahl et al. 2003). Above this limiting period in systems with an evolving companion and magnetic\nbraking, the orbital period increases in time, whereas below this\ncritical period it will decrease in time, since the angular momentum loss by magnetic braking wins from the orbital expansion\ndue to the companion's internal nuclear evolution. In order to\nhave orbital angular momentum loss by magnetic braking, the\ncompanion star must have a convective envelope (Verbunt &\nZwaan 1981, Rappaport et al. 1983, Knigge et al. 2011). This implies for main-sequence stars, that the initial mass cannot have\nbeen larger than 1.5 M\u2299 , since above this mass main-sequence\nstars have radiative envelopes. The conclusion is, therefore, that\nthe companion star in MAXI J1659\u2212152 must have started out\nwith a mass between 1.0 and 1.5 M\u2299 . For examples of the evolution of systems with decreasing orbital periods, and with initial companion masses of 1.0 or 1.5 M\u2299 and a 4.0 M\u2299 black hole\naccretor, see the evolutionary sequences 50 and 55 (table 1) of\nPylyser & Savonije (1988). The sequences Z55 and A55 in this\n\n\f12\n\nE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\npaper started out with a companion mass of 1.5 M\u2299 and evolved\nto an orbital period of 2.4 hr, where the companion masses had\nbecome 0.19 and 0.17 M\u2299 , respectively, with a central H content of 0.21 and 0.09, respectively. The ages of the systems are\nthen about 4.6 and 5.7 billion years, respectively, whilst the mass\ntransfer continues at a very low rate (below 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ). It\nappears that these sequences may well represent the evolution of\nMAXI J1659\u2212152.\n4.2.2. Size of the X-ray source and of the absorbing object\n\nBoth Kennea et al. (2011) and Yamaoka et al. (2012) derive a\nmass of the black hole of MBH \u2243 2.2\u20133.1 M\u2299 and MBH \u2243 3.6\u2013\n8.0 M\u2299 , respectively, based on the minimum innermost disk radius from X-ray spectral fits being the innermost stable circular orbit (assuming a distance of >6.1 kpc and 5.3\u20138.6 kpc, respectively, and an inclination angle of 60\u25e6 \u201375\u25e6 ). Shaposhnikov\net al. (2012), on the other hand, estimated MBH = 20\u00b13 M\u2299 by\nusing an empirical relation between low-frequency QPO and Xray spectral shape. The difference in mass estimates could be explained by taking into account the spin of the black hole (Kennea\net al. 2011, Yamaoka et al. 2012).\nBecause of the rather large uncertainty in possible blackhole masses, we first assume that the black hole has a mass\nof MBH & 3 M\u2299 . Using the companion mass estimate from\nSect. 4.2.1.1, this leads to a mass ratio of q = M2 /MBH . 0.065\n(see also Kennea et al. 2011). Again assuming the companion\nis Roche-lobe filling, we can use the relation between the orbital separation, a, and q (Eggleton 1983), to get a & 1.33 R\u2299 .\nThe duration of the ingress and egress of the absorption dips (a\nfew seconds) and the duration of the dip activity (up to 40 min)\nprovide an estimate of the extent of the object being absorbed\nand the absorber itself, respectively (see, e.g., Kuulkers et al.\n1998, and references therein). Assuming the black-hole mass\nfollows the distribution of known BHXB masses, i.e., taking\nMBH = 8 M\u2299 (\u00d6zel et al. 2010, Kreidberg et al. 2012), and following Kuulkers et al. (1998), we find that the upper limit on the\nextent of the object being absorbed is about 0.002 R\u2299 or 0.005 R\u2299\n(i.e., about 1000 km and 3500 km, respectively), if the absorbing\nmedium corotates with the binary frame or corotates with matter in the accretion disk, respectively. Similarly, the size of the\nabsorbing medium is estimated to be 1.8 R\u2299 and 6.0 R\u2299 , respectively. For lower black-hole masses the estimated sizes are somewhat smaller. The size of the object being absorbed is considerably larger than the innermost disk radius (\u223c30\u2013100 km, Mu\u00f1ozDarias et al. 2011, Yamaoka et al. 2012). The X-ray emission\nthus clearly comes from the inner part of the accretion disk,\nwhich is possibly surrounded by a disk wind or corona. The fact\nthat the absorption dips do not drop to zero intensity at minimum\nis consistent with this: part of the disk wind or corona stays always visible. The estimated sizes of the absorbing medium are\nlarge, i.e., \u223c1\u20133 times the orbital separation. This is very unlikely, so we suggest the absorbing medium to be indeed spread\nover the outer part of the accretion disk, possibly along the accretion disk rim or the region above that, as discussed in Sect. 4.1.1.\n4.3. Optical counterpart of MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nUsing the fact that for LMXB transients the outburst amplitude\n(\u2206V = Vmin \u2212Vmax ) is related to the orbital period, Porb (Shahbaz\n& Kuulkers 1998), we derive that the expected outburst amplitude for MAXI J1659\u2212152, is \u2206V = 11.4 \u00b1 0.8. The observed\noptical magnitude during outburst maximum was, Vmax \u2243 16.5\n\n(see Russell et al. 2010, Kennea et al. 2011). This gives an expected V-magnitude in quiescence: Vmin = 27.9 \u00b1 0.8 (see also\nKennea et al. 2011). Applying the correction for inclination on\nthe observation of Vmax (see Sect. 4.4, Eq. 1) this would lead to\nexpected V-magnitudes between 27.5 and 26.2, for inclination\nangles between 65\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 , respectively. If true, it may therefore not be easy to find the optical counterpart in quiescence.\nA Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) 3Pi sky-survey observation on 2010\nJune 19, however, revealed an optical source consistent with\nthe position of MAXI J1659\u2212152 with an AB magnitude of\nabout 22.8 in the rP1 -band. The source was not detected in\nthe other filters (Kong et al. 2010, Kong 2012). Another observation, on 2012 March 23, with the Canada France Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT), showed the source at a magnitude r'\u224323.7\n(Kong 2012).\nPan-STARRS uses filters similar to the SDSS g',r',i', and z'\nfilters (plus yP1 and wP1 filter), described in detail by Tonry et al.\n(2012). The Pan-STARRS system, like SDSS, is an AB system\n(e.g., Frei & Gunn 1994), so rP1 = r'(AB). To get an estimate of\nthe brightness of the PS1 candidate in the Johnson V-band, we\nuse the rP1 band detection and the gP1 and iP1 upper limits. The\nlimiting magnitudes of the PS1 3Pi sky-survey in the gP1 and\niP1 bands are estimated to be 23.24 and 22.59 mag, respectively\n(for a 5-\u03c3 point source per visit, e.g., Chambers 2006). The\nPan-STARRS measurements thus lead to gP1 \u2212rP1 & 0.44 and\nrP1 \u2212iP1 . 0.21. Using the conversions from the Pan-STARRS\nsystem to the Johnson system (Tonry et al. 2012), we derive\nV & 23.0. This is consistent with the lower limit based on the\nnon-detection in the USNO-B catalogue, V > 21, see Kennea\net al. (2011), although it is off by about 3 magnitudes from that\nexpected (V & 26.2, see above). Another possibility, although\nwe regard it as unlikely, is that the Shahbaz & Kuulkers (1998)\nrelation breaks down at short orbital periods.\nAn M5V star in the Pan-STARRS system gives gP1 \u2212rP1 \u2243\n1.2 and rP1 \u2212iP1 \u2243 1.4 (J. Tonry 2012, priv. comm.). Assuming\nthat in quiescence the optical contribution solely comes from the\ncompanion star, the observed value of rP1 \u2212iP1 of the optical candidate is not compatible with a M5V star. Instead, the relationship between rP1 \u2212iP1 and spectral type suggests the candidate to\nbe of a type earlier than about G3 (J. Tonry 2012, priv. comm.).\nOur assumption above may, however, not be correct. The accretion disk can in quiescence still contribute significantly (e.g.,\nJonker et al. 2012, and references therein). Assuming a disk contribution of about 50%, the discrepancy between the expected\nbrightness of the companion and the suggested optical star becomes about one magnitude less, but is not enough to solve the\ntotal difference of about three magnitudes. Also, the quiescent\ndisk in late-type, short-period BHXBs are not expected to be so\nhot (\u223c6000 K) that the total optical emission mimics a G3-type\nstar. The latter can also not be alleviated by the reddening towards MAXI J1659\u2212152, which is only moderate (see Sect. 4.4).\nThe source reported by Kong et al. (2010) and Kong (2012)\nseems brighter than expected, which cannot be explained by the\ninclination (see above), a disk contribution or reddening (see\nSect. 4.4) alone, and the fact that not all colours are consistent\nwith a M5V star, which can also not be solved by the presence of\nan accretion disk. We, therefore, conclude that we still (Kuulkers\net al. 2012a; see also Kennea et al. 2011) can not exclude the\npossibility that the optical source is a foreground star.\n4.4. Distance to MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nThe distance to MAXI J1659\u2212152 can be estimated in various ways. At maxima during outbursts, the optical brightness\n\n\fE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\nis dominated by emission from the accretion disk. Assuming\nthat all of the optical flux in quiescence comes from the companion, we can use equation 5 of Shahbaz & Kuulkers (1998)\nto derive an estimate of the absolute disk brightness, which is\nthen only a function of Porb . This leads to a rough estimate of\nMV,disk = 1.0 \u00b1 0.8 mag. To estimate the interstellar reddening,\nAV , we use the relation from G\u00fcver & \u00d6zel (2009) between the\nhydrogen column density, NH , and AV . The measured values of\nNH by the Swift/XRT during and after the outburst vary between\n2.4 and 6 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (Kennea et al. 2011, Yamaoka et al. 2012).\nThis is slightly higher than the estimated Galactic H I column\ndensity in the direction of MAXI J1659\u2212152 using Kalberla et\nal. (2005), i.e., the weighted average NH = 1.74 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ,\nindicating there is intrinsic absorption in the system (Kalamkar\net al. 2011, Kennea et al. 2011). This is not unexpected, given\nthe high inclination of the source (see Sect. 4.1.1). To derive\nAV we, therefore, use the estimated Galactic NH , which leads\nto AV \u2243 0.8.10 With the observed maximum V-band magnitude of Vmax = 16.5 (see Sect. 4.3), using the distance modulus\n(see equation 10 of Shahbaz & Kuulkers 1998), we then infer\nthat the distance to MAXI J1659\u2212152 (see also Kennea et al.\n2011) is 8.6 kpc, with an estimated uncertainty of 3.7 kpc. Using\nthis distance, we find a height above the Galactic plane, z, of\n2.4\u00b11.0 kpc (see also Kennea et al. 2011).\nAs noted by Miller-Jones et al. (2011), our derived distance\nmay be an overestimate, since the relation from Shahbaz &\nKuulkers (1998) does not take into account the inclination angle\nof the system. At large inclination angles the projected area of\nthe disk may be smaller, and, therefore, the apparent disk brightness be less. One thus has to correct the observed optical magnitude at maximum for this effect. For an optically thick accretion\ndisk this correction amounts to (Paczy\u0144ski & SchwarzenbergCzerny 1980, assuming a limb-darkening coefficient of 0.6, see\nalso Warner 1987):\n\u2206MV = \u22122.5 log [(1 + 1.5 cos i) cos i]\n\n(1)\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nFor inclination angles between 65 and 80 we find that\n\u2206MV varies from 0.40 to 1.65. This leads to revised distance estimates between 7.1\u00b13.0 kpc and 4.0\u00b11.7 kpc, respectively. Accordingly, z then has values between 2.0\u00b10.9 kpc and\n1.1\u00b10.5 kpc, respectively.\nFor a M5V star (Sect. 4.2.1.1) the absolute V-band magnitude is about 11.8 (e.g., Zombeck 1990). Although not very constraining, the observed value of V for the proposed optical counterpart in quiescence (see Sect. 4.3) translates to a lower limit\nto the distance of about 1.1 kpc. Assuming our expected V-band\nmagnitude in quiescence (Vmin = 26.2\u201327.9 mag; Sect. 4.3) we\nderive a distance of 5.3\u20138.7 kpc from the distance modulus.\nUsing the PS1 optical counterpart in quiescence proposed\nby Kong et al. (2010, Sect. 4.3), and assuming that the companion is the sole contributor during optical quiescence, MillerJones et al. (2011) estimated the distance to MAXI J1659\u2212152\nto be 1.6\u20134.2 kpc. Assuming the companion to be an M5V (see\nSect. 4.2.1) or an M2V (Jonker et al. 2012) type star, and using\nthe CFHT optical detection (see Sect. 4.3), Kong (2012) derived\ndistances of 2.3\u20133.8 kpc and 4.6\u20137.5k\u0307pc, respectively. Kaur et\nal. (2012) estimate a lower limit of 4\u00b11 kpc, based on the measured radial velocity distribution of the interstellar Na I D and\n10\nNote that this is different from the values quoted in D'Avanzo et al.\n(2010; AV \u2243 0.34), and Kuulkers et al. (2012a) and Kaur et al. (2012;\nAV \u2243 1.1), based on the measured NH from Swift/XRT observations\nreported by Kennea et al. (2010). Kennea et al. (2011) used AV = 1.85\n(in the UVOT photometric system), which is an upper limit based on a\nvalue of E(B \u2212 V)=0.606 in the direction of MAXI J1659\u2212152.\n\n13\n\nCa II H&K lines. Using the relation between the absolute magnitude of a LMXB as a function of the orbital period and the Xray luminosity (van Paradijs & McClintock 1994), and assuming\nthat MAXI J1659\u2212152 reached 10% of the Eddington luminosity at maximum of the outburst, Kennea et al. (2011) derived\ndistances in the range \u22433.2\u20137.5 kpc for values of AV from 1.85\nto 0. Assuming MBH > 3.2 M\u2299 and that MAXI J1659\u2212152 at the\npeak of the outburst radiates at more than 10% of the Eddington\nlimit, they derive a distance >6.1 kpc. Jonker et al. (2012), using\na M2V type companion star and an accretion disk contribution\nto the quiescent optical light of 50%, derive a distance of 5.9 kpc\nwith an estimated uncertainty of 2 kpc. Shaposhnikov et al.\n(2012), using their spectral-timing correlation scaling method,\nfound an upper limit of 7.6\u00b11.1 kpc, whereas Yamaoka et al.\n(2012) estimate an upper limit of about 8.6 kpc. The latter authors combined various information, including the fact that the\nsoft-to-hard transition in BHXB transients occurs at 1\u20134% of\nthe Eddington luminosity (Maccarone 2003; see also Sect. 4.5).\nNone of these estimates are particularly robust, however, and\nthere is a considerable spread. Our initial estimates in the beginning of this subsection are consistent with the above quoted\nvalues; therefore, in the rest of this paper we adhere to our values of the distance of 8.6 kpc, and the distance above the Galactic\nplane of z = 2.2 kpc.\n4.5. On the soft to hard state transition luminosity and the\nmaximum outburst luminosity\n\nBlack-hole transient sources transit from the soft state to the hard\nstate when the source luminosity is about 1\u20134% of the Eddington\nluminosity, LEdd , with a mean value of 1.9\u00b10.2% (Maccarone\n2003; see also Dunn et al. 2010 for a discussion). Both the spectral and timing behaviour can be used to determine the exact\ntime of transition (e.g., Dunn et al. 2010, Belloni 2010, Mu\u00f1ozDarias et al. 2011a, and references therein). In the hard state,\npower-law emission dominates and the power-density spectrum\nshows a strong noise component. MAXI J1659\u2212152 reached the\nhard state between day 39.1 and day 40.1 (Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al.\n2011b). Maccarone (2003) used a cut-off power-law spectrum,\nwith spectral index, \u0393 = 1.8, and cut-off energy of 200 keV, integrated between 0.5 keV and 10 MeV to derive the bolometric correction. To estimate the bolometric flux near the transition of the soft-to-hard state for MAXI J1659\u2212152, we used\nthe spectrum observed on day 41.0 from Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al.\n11\n(2011b), which showed \u0393 = 1.80+0.02\nWe used their spectral\n\u22120.03 .\nparameters, added a cut-off at 200 keV (which is well outside the\nRXTE/PCA energy range), and then integrated between 0.5 keV\nand 10 MeV. To estimate the uncertainty in the bolometric flux\nwe randomised the spectral parameters using the fit values (and a\nfixed high-energy cut-off at 200 keV) and their derived 1\u03c3-errors\nfrom Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al. (2011b). This was done 100 000 times\nand we recorded the resulting integrated fluxes between 0.5 keV\nand 10 MeV. The flux distributions are significantly skewed towards larger fluxes. We, therefore, fitted the flux distributions\nbelow and above the peak of the distribution with Gaussians\nwith different widths. The plus and minus errors in the integrated\nflux derived from the spectral fits were then taken as the 1\u03c3\nwidths (see, e.g., Kuulkers et al. 2010a). We find an estimated\n11\n\nNote that Yamaoka et al. (2012) used the estimated bolometric flux\nfrom an observation of the hard state after the state transition, on day\n44.1. Their observation is about 3 days later than the observation we\ntake as being near the transition; the flux had declined by about 20% in\nthat time.\n\n\f14\n\nE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\n\u22129\n\u22122 \u22121\n(unabsorbed) bolometric flux of 4.20+0.42\n\u22120.34 \u00d7 10 erg cm s .\nSince the mass of the black hole can be assumed to be at\nleast 3 M\u2299 , we derive an upper limit on the transition luminosity for MAXI J1659\u2212152 of about 10% LEdd . For a canonical black-hole mass of 8 M\u2299 (\u00d6zel et al. 2010, Kreidberg et al.\n2012) we derive a transition luminosity of \u22433.7% LEdd . The latter is consistent with the soft to hard state transition luminosity derived by Maccarone (2003), and would suggest a more\ncanonical mass of the black hole in MAXI J1659\u2212152. We note,\nhowever, that the black-hole transient GRO J1655\u221240 did not\nfit Maccarone's (2003) relation. GRO J1655\u221240 is also a highinclination, dipping source, similar to MAXI J1659\u2212152 (see\nKuulkers et al. 1998, 2000; Sect. 4.1.1). The above, and given the\nrange in distance (Sect. 4.4) and black-hole mass (Sect. 4.2.2)\nestimates, leads us to conclude that our test of Maccarone's\n(2003) relation should be used with some caution in the case\nof MAXI J1659\u2212152.\nThe maximum observed 2\u201310 keV flux during\nMAXI J1659\u2212152's outburst (\u22439\u00d710\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 on day\n13.1; Kennea et al. 2011) translates to a maximum 2\u201310 keV\nluminosity of roughly 8\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 . This value is not unusual\nfor transient BHXBs (see, e.g., Dunn et al. 2010). From the\nX-ray spectral fit results by Yamaoka et al. (2012; their model\nA), one can derive that the extrapolated maximum, unabsorbed,\n3\u2013200 keV flux occurred on day 13.0, i.e., \u224310\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nFor a black-hole with minimum mass of 3 M\u2299 this gives an\nupper limit on the maximum outburst 3\u2013200 keV luminosity,\nLpeak , of about 23% LEdd ; for a black hole with 8 M\u2299 this would\nlead to Lpeak \u2243 8.5% LEdd . The latter value is more or less as\nexpected from the observed relation between the maximum\n3\u2013200 keV luminosity and Porb (Wu et al. 2010).\n\n4.6. A class of short-period BHXB transients at high Galactic\nlatitudes?\n\nIt is interesting to note (see also Kennea et al. 2011, Yamaoka et\nal. 2012) that the two transient BHXBs with the shortest orbital\nperiods, MAXI J1659\u2212152 and Swift J1753.5\u22120127, are both\nfound at high Galactic latitudes (bII = 16.5\u25e6 and bII = 12.2\u25e6 ,\nrespectively), as well as a third short-period transient BHXB:\nXTE J1118+480 (see Zurita et al. 2008, bII = 62.3\u25e6). Given\ntheir distances, the corresponding heights above the Galactic\nplane are: z = 2.4 kpc (see Sect. 4.4), 1.1 kpc (Zurita et al.\n2008) and 1.6 kpc (Jonker & Nelemans 2004), respectively. This\ncan be compared with the observed Galactic z-distribution of\nthe BHXBs, which has an rms z-value of 0.625 kpc (Jonker &\nNelemans 2004). Recently, another candidate for such a binary\nhas been put forward: Swift J1357.2\u22120933 (Casares et al. 2011,\nsee also Yamaoka et al. 2012; bII = 51\u25e6 ). This system has a\nM4V star as the companion (Rau et al. 2011, Casares et al. 2011)\nand is subluminous in the radio (Sivakoff et al. 2011), similar to\nMAXI J1659\u2212152 (see below). However, as noted in Sect. 4.1.1,\nthe optical outburst amplitude of \u223c6 mag (Rau et al. 2011) is\nnot consistent with the short period suggested by Casares et al.\n(2011).\nSwift J1753.5\u22120127 shares other similarities than only the\nshort orbital period with MAXI J1659\u2212152. The shape of the\noverall outburst light curve as seen by Swift/BAT (Soleri et al.\n2010), is very similar to that seen for MAXI J1659\u2212152 (see\nalso Kennea et al. 2011). Swift J1753.5\u22120127, however, has\nnot been seen to turn off again so far, i.e., pre-outburst 15\u2013\n50 keV flux levels have not been reached. Moreover, after it\nhad reached the lowest levels about 200 days after the start of\nthe outburst, it has been seen to vary on years time scales be-\n\ntween about 20 mCrab and 125 mCrab (see, e.g., figure 1 of\nSoleri et al. 2010). It has also been active in the radio wavelengths at a lower level compared to when the source was in\noutburst (Soleri et al. 2010). Low-level soft X-ray and radio activity has been reported for MAXI J1659\u2212152 (Kennea et al.\n2011, Yang et al. 2011a, 2011b, Yang & Wijnands 2011a, 2011b,\nMiller-Jones et al. 2011, Jonker et al. 2012). In the hard, 15\u2013\n50 keV band MAXI J1659\u2212152 is not (yet) detected, from about\n65 days after the start of the outburst up to now. But it may be\ndetected later again, if it follows the same trend as that seen for\nSwift J1753.5\u22120127. One can compare the main outburst light\ncurve of MAXI J1659\u2212152 also with that of the BHXB transient XTE J1859+226 (Casella et al. 2004; see also Sect. 4.1.2).\nA high, soft, flux period is followed by a jump to a low, hard,\none. In XTE J1859+226 the main outburst lasted also for about\na month, with day to day variations similar to that seen for\nMAXI J1659\u2212152. The orbital period of XTE J1859+226, however, is not as extreme: \u22436.6 hr (Corral-Santana et al. 2011).\nYamaoka et al. (2012) argue that MAXI J1659\u2212152 is a runaway micro-quasar, similar to XTE J1118+480, i.e., kicked out\nof the Galactic plane into the halo. We consider this indeed\na plausible possibility for explaining the apparently large distances of these short-period systems from the Galactic plane\nfor the following reasons (we say here \"apparently\", because\nthe distances to these systems are still quite uncertain, causing considerable uncertainty in their distances to the Galactic\nplane). The available evidence for kicks imparted to the black\nholes in their formation events suggests that a sizeable fraction\nof black holes may receive rather large kick velocities at birth:\nGRO J1655\u221240 has an observed excess radial velocity relative to\nits local rest frame of 112\u00b118 km s\u22121 , and simulations of its evolution and formation by Willems et al. (2005), including the effects of kicks, indicate that the most likely kick velocity imparted\nin its formation was 105 km s\u22121 . Similarly, XTE J1118+480 has\nan excess radial velocity of 145\u00b125 km s\u22121 and simulations of\nits evolution and formation by Fragos et al. (2007) indicate that\na most likely kick velocity of about 200 km s\u22121 imparted in its\nformation event. On the other hand, simulations of the evolution of the Cyg X-1 system by Wong et al. (2012) indicate that\nthe kick imparted at its formation was less than 77 km s\u22121 and\nmost probably not more than about 40 km s\u22121 (see also Reid et\nal. 2011). The BHXB V404 Cyg has a peculiar velocity of about\n40 km s\u22121 (Miller-Jones et al. 2009), indicating that its black hole\ndid not receive a velocity kick larger than this value. If many\nblack holes would receive a velocity kick of the same order as\nthose of GRO J1655\u221240 and XTE J1118+480, i.e., about 100 to\n200 km s\u22121 , one may expect that many of the systems with short\norbital periods will have high runaway velocities. As mentioned\nin Sect. 4.2.1, in order for a BHXB to evolve to a very short\norbital period, the initial mass of the companion star must have\nbeen .1.5 M\u2299 . If a typical black hole of mass 6 to 10 M\u2299 received a kick of 100\u2013200 km s\u22121 , the systems which have to drag\nalong only a companion of low mass (.1.5 M\u2299 ) will get the highest space velocities. In that case one expects the systems with the\nlargest space velocities - and therefore the largest mean distances to the galactic plane - to be found among the BHXBs\nwith the shortest orbital periods. (However, since there are also\nsome black holes that do not receive large kicks, one still would\nalso expect some of the systems with very short orbital periods\nto be located not far from the Galactic plane).\nThe alternative possibility, that the systems with the shortest\norbital periods were kicked out of globular clusters, seems very\nunlikely. Black holes will be born very early in the life of a globular cluster (within the first ten million years). They will then by\n\n\fE. Kuulkers et al.: MAXI J1659\u2212152\n\ngravitational interactions with the other cluster stars rapidly sink\nto the cluster core, where the most massive objects of the cluster\nwill concentrate. Calculations (Kulkarni et al. 1993) show that in\nclusters of high central density the rapid dynamical evolution of\nthe black-hole population in the cluster core leads to the ejection\nof nearly all the black holes on a short time scale. Because of\nthe virtual absence of low-mass stars in these dense cores, it is\nvery unlikely that they will have been able to capture a low-mass\nstar before they were kicked out. However, for clusters of intermediate density, these authors found that some black holes survive in the cluster, and that some of these surviving black holes\ncould form a LMXB. However, these BHXBs will stay in the\ncluster, since during a later phase in the evolution of the cluster,\nsuch a massive object cannot be kicked out any more by dynamical interactions with the cluster stars, because these are now of\nmuch lower mass than the black hole. It thus seems virtually impossible that systems like MAXI J1659\u2212152 were formed in a\nglobular cluster.\n4.7. Summary\n\nWe have presented here a very detailed analysis of the X-ray and\nUV light curves of MAXI J1659\u2212152, obtained over \u223c260 days\nin 2010\u20132011 with MAXI, RXTE, Swift and XMM-Newton. Our\nanalysis combined soft and hard energies and time resolutions\nto create a uniform presentation of the source intensity and timing behaviour. We identified two types of variations in the light\ncurves, absorption and transition dips, characterised by differing\nspectral properties. The timing studies of these have led us to the\nfollowing conclusions.\n\u2013 The absorption dips occur at the orbital period of the system\nand are due to the combined effects of high orbital inclination and obscuration by material from the companion star interacting with the accretion disk. The presence of these dips\nhas allowed us to measure precisely the orbital period of the\nbinary at 2.414\u00b10.005 hrs. This is the shortest BHXB period\nmeasured to date and is confirmed (Kuroda et al. 2010) with\nmodulations of the optical light curve of the system.\n\u2013 Using the absorption dips we have constrained the inclination of MAXI J1659\u2212152 to be between 65\u25e6 \u201380\u25e6 and the\nspectral type of the companion star to be M5V.\n\u2013 We also identified transition dips, which are most likely a\nresult of instabilities in the inner accretion flow. During these\ndips the source softens with increasing intensity, in contrast\nto the absorption dips, which are less energy dependent with\nincreasing count rates. The exact origin of these dips remains\nunknown.\n\u2013 Using an estimate of the black hole mass of >3 M\u2299 , and a\nratio between the compact object and the companion mass\nof q = M2 /MBH . 0.065, we estimate the binary orbital\nseparation to be a & 1.33 R\u2299 .\n\u2013 The very short orbital period of the system allowed us to\nsuccessfully argue that the companion is a nuclearly evolved\nstar with initial mass of about 1.5 M\u2299 , which evolved to 0.19\n(0.17) M\u2299 during 4.6 (5.7) billion years (depending on the\nevolutionary sequence).\n\u2013 We adopt an inferred distance to the source of 8.6 \u00b1 3.7 kpc\nand a distance above the Galactic plane of z = 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 kpc,\nwhich translates to maximum 2\u201310 keV and 3\u2013200 keV luminosities of \u223c8\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 and \u223c9\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 , respectively.\n\u2013 There are by now three BHXB sources with relatively short\nperiods and high Galactic scale heights. These have been ar-\n\n15\n\ngued to be runaway micro-quasars, i.e., systems kicked out\nof the plane into the halo. We argue that this hypothesis\nis better supported by the properties of MAXI J1659\u2212152,\nwhen contrasted with the suggestion that the system was\nformed in a globular cluster.\nFuture X-ray spectral analysis, as well as additional multiwavelength studies, both in outburst and quiescence, will elucidate the shortest period BHXB further.\nAcknowledgements.

In a we mark the times of the Swift/XRT ('X'), Chandra\n('Ch') and radio ('R') observations taken in 2011 (see Sect. 3.1). Middle panel: Zoom-in from the top panel, focusing on the main\npart of the 2010/2011 outburst of MAXI J1659\u2212152. (c) RXTE/PCA PCU2 light curve, at a 16 s time resolution. The data within\nan observation are connected to guide the eye; errors are not plotted since they are negligible. The time-span of the XMM-Newton\nobservations, discussed in this paper, is indicated in the top-left ('XMM'). The times of the transition dips ('td'; see text) are marked\nby arrows. The time spans for the four main epochs described in the text ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') are indicated at the bottom of this\ngraph. (d) MAXI/GSC and (e) Swift/BAT light curves, showing averages per satellite orbit. The vertical dotted line marks the time\nof the first MAXI/GSC detection (Negoro et al. 2010). (f) Hardness values as a function of time. Hardness is defined as the ratio\nof the 0.5 day averaged count rates in the Swift/BAT 15\u201350 keV band to the MAXI/GSC 2\u201320 keV band. Bottom panel: Zoom-in\nfrom the middle panel, focusing on a possible 3-day variation discussed in Sect. 3.1. (g) MAXI/GSC and (h) Swift/BAT light curves\nshowing the averages over a satellite orbit, between days 15 and 31. We also show the results of a sinusoidal fit to describe the\npossible \u223c3 day variation, plus a constant, linear and quadratic term to account for the longer-term trend, between days 18 and 28.\nThe horizontal dotted lines in a, b, d, e, g and h correspond to the zero level.\n\n\fE.

Top: Hardness-intensity diagram obtained using all the RXTE/PCA observations\navailable (adapted from Mu\u00f1oz-Darias et al.\n(2011b). Intensity corresponds to the count rate\nin the 2\u201315 keV band and hardness is defined as\nthe ratio of counts in 6.1\u201310.2 keV and 3.3\u20136.1\nkeV bands. Each point corresponds to the average over an observation. Observations with a\nstar correspond to those with a so-called type-B\nQPO in the power-density spectra (see text). A\nsolid line joins consecutive observations starting from observation with a big, open circle\n(top right). Observations taken after the last\ntype-B QPO are joined by a dotted line. The\nthree arrows mark the observations with clear\ntransition dips on days 23.7, 24.0 and 26.1.\nAll observations between days 0 and 10, i.e.,\nwhen absorption dips occur, have hardness values &0.45.\n\n\f"}
