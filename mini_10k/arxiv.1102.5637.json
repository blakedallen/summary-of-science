STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nEarthquakes, like volcanic eruptions as well as other physical phenomena and perhaps also some kinds of socio-economical\n\"revolutions\", show an abrupt transition from one state to another. We consider cases where this transition is intrinsic (not the\nresult of an excitation from outside) and dynamical in the sense that, as a parameter changes slowly, the system jumps by a\nfinite amount in a time much shorter than the typical time of evolution of the external parameter. In earthquake physics, this\ntypical time of evolution, the earthquake recurrence time, is on geological scales of plate tectonics although the time scale of\nseismic ruptures is within the second to minute range [1]. Our basic assumption is that, as a dynamical system, an earthquake\nshows a \"dynamical saddle-node\" bifurcation. At the bifurcation point, a pair of fixed points, one locally stable the other locally\nunstable, merge and vanish as a control parameter varies. Take a damped dynamical system, with a coordinate x(t) solution of\nthe equation\ndx\n\u2202V\n=\u2212\n.\ndt\n\u2202x\n\n(1)\n\nIn this equation V (x) is a potential. In the geophysical context of earthquakes, the scalar variable x could be the relative\ndisplacement across the fault. The equation (1) is too general to be very helpful. However, as time varies slowly, it may describe\na saddle-node bifurcation where a stable equilibrium disappears, assuming that V depends slowly on time in a prescribed way,\nto become a function V (x, t). Near the transition, one may use a mathematical picture which is correct for a short time around\nthe transition if the potential V (x, t) is a smooth function (see below for what happens beyond this local study).\nAssume first that V (.) does not depend explicitely on time and takes the form\n1\nV (x) = \u2212( x3 + bx),\n3\n\n(2)\n\nwith b real constant (for the moment).\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212b, is an\nFor b negative V (x) has two real extrema (i.e. the roots of \u2202V\n\u2202x = 0), one \u2212 \u2212b is a stable equilibrium, the other,\nunstable equilibrium. For b = 0 the two equilibria merge and disappear for b positive, see Figure (1-a). This is the saddle-node\nbifurcation. The shape of V (x) near x = 0 and for b small is universal: for a given smooth V (x) showing this saddle-node\nbifurcation, one can always rescale time and external parameter to find the \"local' problem in this form.\nThe extension to time dependent variation of the control parameter b goes as follows. If b is a smooth function of time, one\ncan assume that b(t) crosses the critical value, i.e. zero in the present case, at time zero in such a way that b(t) = at + ... with a\nnon zero constant, and the dots being for higher terms in the Taylor expansion of b(t). For t and x close to zero, after elementary\nrescaling, one can represent the dynamical system (1), close to the saddle-node bifurcation, by an \"universal\" parameterless\nequation\ndx\n= x2 + t.\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nOutside of the neighborhood of x = 0, the solution of (1) depends on other parameters like the one defining V (.) far from\nx = 0 , as studied below.\n\n\f2\nV HxL\n\nV q HxL\n\n3\n\n5\n2\n\n4\n1\n\n3\n-2\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nx\n\n2\n1\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n(a)\n\n-2\n\n(b)\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nx\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Cubic potential for b = \u22121, 0, 1. (b) Quartic potential, b = \u22121, 0, 1\n\nA.\n\nSolution close to the saddle-node\n\nLet first consider what happens close to the saddle-node bifurcation. We look for a solution of equation (3) transiting from the\n\"stable\" fixed point at \"large\"\nnegative times to the rolling down one towards positive value of x at positive times. This solution\n\u221a\nbehaves like x(t) \u2248 \u2212 \u2212t at large negative times. The equation (3) is of the Riccatti type and can be integrated by introducing\n\u2032\nthe function y(t) such that x(t) = \u2212 yy where y \u2032 = dy\ndt and y(t) is a solution of Airy's equation,\ny \u2032\u2032 + ty = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nThe solution relevant with the given condition for x(t) at t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, is the Airy function Ai(\u2212t) which writes\nY (t) = Ai(\u2212t) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\ncos(\n\n0\n\nu3\n\u2212 ut)du,\n3\n\n(5)\n\nand leads to the curve x(t) drawn on Figure(2-a). Yet we have only solved the transient problem near the saddle-node bifurcation.\nThe transition ends-up when t becomes equal to the first zero of the Airy function Ai(\u2212t), corresponding to a divergence of the\noriginal x(t). Let tc be this critical value of t, i.e. the smallest root of Y (t) = 0, a pure number, about tc \u2248 2.338, and let us\nlook at the behaviour of x(t) just before this transition. From the Laurent expansion of Y (t) close to tc , and returning to the\noriginal variable x(t), one obtains\nx(t) \u2248\n\n1\ntc\n\u2212 (tc \u2212 t)....\ntc \u2212 t\n3\n\n(6)\n\nAs this solution diverges, it looses its validity because the \"universal\" dynamical equation (3) was derived under the condition\nthat x remains close to zero. This local theory cannot deal with finite variations away from the critical conditions, therefore we\nshall add finite amplitude effects to limit the growth of the instability after the transition.\nWe shall study now two questions, first the response of this dynamical system to an external noise source, then the dynamics\nof a system showing a saddle-node bifurcation of the type just studied and reaching a new stable fixed point after this bifurcation.\nB. Response to an external noise source\n\nWe explore first the response of our system to a small external noise, and search whether the response to the noise changes\nqualitatively and so could be a signal ahead of the transition.\nLet us consider the equation (3) with a small noise added, so that equation (3) is replaced by\ndx\n= x2 + t + \u01eb\u03b6(t),\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b6(t) is a random function of time, and \u01eb a small factor.\nIn the limit \u01eb small, one can solve equation (7) by expansion in powers of \u01eb,\nx(t) = x0 (t) + \u01ebx1 (t) + ....\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nx0 (t) = \u2212\n\nY \u2032 (t)\n,\nY (t)\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nThe linear response to the noise is\nx1 (t) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\nY (t)\n\nt\n\ndt\u0303 \u03b6(t\u0303) Y 2 (t\u0303).\n\n(10)\n\nt0\n\nBecause Y 2 (t\u0303) tends rapidly to zero as (t\u0303) tends to minus infinity, one can take t0 = \u2212\u221e to get rid of the effect of the initial\nconditions.\nLet us take a delta-correlated (or white) noise, such that\nh\u03b6(ta )\u03b6(tb )i = \u03b4(ta \u2212 tb ).\n\n(11)\n\nNote that, including with \u01eb = 1, the solution of equation (7) with noise is still very close to the noiseless solution x0 (t).\nThe correlation function of x1 (t) is given by\nhx1 (t)x1 (t\u2032 )i =\n\n1\n2\nY (t)Y 2 (t\u2032 )\n\nZ\n\ninf(t,t\u2032 )\n\ndt\u0303Y 4 (t\u0303),\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhose behavior for large negative values of both t and t\u2032 , is derived from the asymptotic expression of the Airy function,\n2\n\nAi(\u2212t) \u2248\n\n3/2\n\n\u2212 (\u2212t)\n3\ne\u221a\n.\n2 \u03c0(\u2212t)1/4\n\nSetting w = t\u0303t , and F (w) = 1 \u2212 w3/2 , the variance \u03c3 2 = h(x(t) \u2212 x0 (t))2 i of the fluctuations writes\n2\n\nhx1 (t) i \u2248 (\u2212t)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n\ndw 8 (\u2212t)3/2 F (w)\ne3\n.\nw\n\n(13)\n\nIn the limit (\u2212t) \u2192 \u221e the integral is concentrated near w = 1 so that\n1\n1\n(\u2212t)\u2212 2 ,\n4\n\nhx1 (t)2 i \u2248\n\n(14)\n\nx\n\nx\n\n2\n\n1\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n\u03be\n\nt\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nt\n\nt\n\n1\u0092 0\n\n-2\n\n0.2\n\nt0\n\n-0.5\n\n-30\n\n(a)\n\n-3\n\n(b)\n\n-1.0\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n20\n\ntc\n\n30\n\n40\n\nt\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Solutions of equation (7), with and without noise, \u01eb = 0 (smooth curve) and \u01eb = 1 (noisy curve).

The\ncritical time is tc \u223c 2.34 t0 . The two vertical lines inserted between the two arrows delimitate the large slope time duration, of order unity.\n\nwhich shows that the fluctuations increase as time goes on, some time before the transition itself. As the transition approaches,\nthe variance of the fluctuations increases close to the critical time tc , because Y (tc ) = 0.\nBecause of the divergence of the solution at t = tc , it does not make sense to describe the dynamical behavior of the\nfluctuations due to the external noise very close to tc . This unbounded growth is a consequence of the local cubic form of V (x)\nas expanded near x = 0, which is valid around x = 0 only, in obvious contradiction with the fact that x(t) diverges.\nII.\n\nDYNAMICAL SADDLE-NODE BIFURCATION TOWARD A NEW STEADY STATE\n\nTo suppress the divergence of x(t) after the saddle-node bifurcation we add a stabilizing (positive) term to the potential V (x)\nwhich becomes quartic,\n\nVq (x) = \u2212\n\nx3\nx4\n\u2212 bx + ,\n3\n4\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\nas drawn in Figure(1-b). Because of the growth of Vq (x) at infinity, like x4 , the solution of the differential equation\n\u2202Vq\ndx\n=\u2212\n= b + x2 \u2212 x3 , .\ndt\n\u2202x\n\n(16)\n\ndoes not diverge at finite time. The equation (15) can be written in the given scaled form, provided the coefficient of x4 is\npositive. For such a potential one parameter only remains. In equation (15) the coefficient is chosen as b, the one of the linear\nterm. For b = 0 the dynamical system (16) is exactly at the saddle-node bifurcation, because at b = x = 0 the first and second\nderivative of Vq (x) both vanish, but not the third one. Contrary to the case of the pure cubic potential, this system has always,\nthat is for any value of b, a stable fixed point beyond the pair of fixed points collapsing at the saddle-node bifurcation. This\nmakes it a fair candidate for describing the dynamical saddle-node bifurcation without blow-up.\nAs in the previous case, we shall look now at the case of a time dependent b, that will be taken as b = at with a positive\nconstant. Because of the rescaling of the cubic and quartic term, the parameter a cannot be eliminated (another possibility is\n3\n4\nto put a parameter in front of the cubic term). For the potential Vq (x) = \u2212 x3 \u2212 atx + x4 we shall analyse the solution of the\ndynamical equation\ndx\n= at + x2 \u2212 x3 ,\ndt\n\n(17)\n\ntending at large times to the quasi-equilibrium point x = (at)1/3 , t being considered as a parameter, see Figure(2-c). Moreover\nwe consider the limit a small, which could describe a wide range of slip phenomena [2], as earthquakes where a is generally\nvery small, of order 10\u22129 (see below).\nA.\n\nThree time ranges for small a\n\nIn this limit we show first that there are three characteristic time intervals, depending how x is close to zero.\nThe long time scale is the average recurrence time of an earthquake at the same site along the fault. It is typically of order\ntphys\n\u223c 200 years. In our model it is the time needed for the potential Vq (x, t) to change significantly, to move from a pair of\nb\nfixed points to a saddle-node bifurcation. Because time enters in Vq (x, t) through the combination (at), the adimensional time\nneeded for a change of shape of Vq is of order\ntb \u223c a\u22121 .\n\n(18)\n\nThe short time teqk is of order unity in our model equation (17) as stated in the next paragraph. It is the duration of the abrupt\nchange of the slope of the solution x(t). This short time corresponds to the dynamic rupture duration, which is typically of order\nten seconds for a magnitude 6 earthquake, tphys\neqk \u223c 10s [1]. Therefore the ratio of these two time scales\n\ntphys\neqk\ntphys\nb\n\n=\n\nteqk\ntb ,\n\nis small as\n\na = 1.6 10\u22129 in the geophysical context.\nThere is another time scale, t0 , the time interval standing before the transition, and close to it, during which the potential is\nvery flat, while the solution has not jumped. During this time, x and at are much smaller than unity, then the cubic term on the\nright-hand side of equation (17) is negligible. In this range one recovers the universal equation of\n\u221athe dynamical saddle-node\nbifurcation (3) by taking X = xa\u22121/3 and T = ta1/3 , with the boundary condition X(t) \u2248 \u2212 \u2212T at T tending to minus\ninfinity. This property concerns the rectangular domain drawn on Figure (2-c), where x is small, x \u223c a1/3 , and t extends\nfrom \u2212a\u22121/3 to t \u223c a\u22121/3 , located before the abrupt increase. Therefore the time extension of this domain introduces the\nintermediate time scale,\nt0 \u223c a\u22121/3 ,\n\n(19)\n\nlong compared to unity (the adimensional time scale teqk for the duration of a seismic rupture) and small compared to tb = a\u22121 ,\nthe average recurrence time between earthquakes.\nLet us prove that the short time is of order unity, by matching the solution X(T ) of the universal equation to the solution of\n1\nbefore it diverges,\nequation (20) below, in the vicinity of the critical point tc (a) = a\u22121/3 tc . Because X(T ) behaves like tc \u2212T\n1\n\u22121/3\ntc before the critical time. Using\nit follows that the solution x(t) behaves as \u2248 a\u22121/3 tc \u2212t for \"large\" values of \u03b4t = t \u2212 a\n\u03b4t in this development as time variable, x(\u03b4t) becomes of order one when \u03b4t becomes of order one too. When this happens, the\nterm at in equation (17) is negligible, therefore the solution of this equation which can be matched with the solution near the\nbifurcation is the solution of the integrable equation\ndx(\u03b4t)\n= x(\u03b4t)2 \u2212 x(\u03b4t)3 ,\nd(\u03b4t)\n\n(20)\n\n\f5\n1\nwith the asymptotic behavior for very large negative times x(\u03b4t) \u223c \u2212 \u03b4t\n. This equation shows that the time scale for the\nearthquake rupture is of order one, because it has no explicit dependence with respect to the small parameter a. This result\nis confirmed by the numerics: For a small we find that the rising time of x(t) close to tc (a) (defined as the half-width of the\nslope dx\ndt solution of equation (17)) is teqk \u223c 2.5, independent of a. From the observational point of view, the catastrophe\ntakes place during this time teqk of order one, because the displacement is of order one then, compared to the displacement of\norder a1/3 taking place during time a\u22121/3 typical of the \"universal\" transition process. The two solutions match in the range\n1 \u226a (\u2212\u03b4t) \u226a a\u22121/3 . Supposing that the physical fast time scale for earthquakes is tphys\neqk \u223c 10s, the intermediate time scale is\n\u22129\ntphys\n\u223c a\u22121/3 tphys\n.\n0\neqk , which is a few hours for a = 10\n\nB. Precursor effects due to an external noise\n\nWith a noise source added, the dynamical equation (1) becomes,\ndx\n= x2 \u2212 x3 + at + \u01eb\u03b6(t).\ndt\n\n(21)\n\nActually the effective noise amplitude is not equal to \u01eb close to the saddle-node, but depends on the value of the parameter a.\nIndeed for |t| \u2264 t0 , the cubic term in equation (22) is negligible, and the equation reduces to\ndx\n= x2 + at + \u01eb\u03b6(t).\ndt\n\n(22)\n\n2\n\u22121/3\n, T = ta1/3 , and \u01eb\u0303(a) = \u01eba\u22122/3 . Therefore\nwhich may be written on a form dX\ndT = X + T + \u01eb\u0303(a)\u03b6(t), by setting X = xa\nthe effective noise is larger than \u01eb in the rectangular domain of figure (2-c).\nLet us study the fluctuations of the solution x(t) of equation (22). For a small noise input, the solution may be expanded in\npower of \u01eb as above. At first order it gives\n\ndx1\n= [2x0 (t) \u2212 3x20 (t)]x1 (t) + \u03b6(t),\ndt\n\n(23)\n\nwhose solution is formally\nx1 (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\ndt\u0303 \u03b6(t\u0303) exp[g(t) \u2212 g(t\u0303)],\n\n(24)\n\nRt\nd2 V (x)\nwhere g(t) is the time integral of the second derivative of the potential \u2212 dxq2 , g(t) = t0 [2x0 (u) \u2212 3x20 (u)]. The standard\ndeviation \u03c3x1 (t) has to be calculated numerically. We expect it to display the same behavior as for the cubic case in the whole\ndomain where x(t) \u226a 1 , i.e. before the transition, and close to it, because the potential is cubic in this region. After the\ntransition, we expect that the fluctuation decreases, because the solution without noise becomes quasi-steady. This is confirmed\nby the numerics: as for the cubic potential, the fluctuations strongly increase close to the critical time tc . With respect to time,\nthe maximum of \u03c3x1 occurs at time tc (a) for small noise. Therefore the variance of the signal fluctuations cannot be used as\na precursor for predicting the transition. Such a correlation between the standard deviation of the fluctuations and the sudden\nchange of the solution has been reported recently [3] where the GPS geodetic signal, which can be assimilated to our x0 (t), is\nshown to be strongly correlated to the seismic signal (which we see as related to the fluctuations x1 (t)). Note that when the\nnoise increases, the growth of the fluctuations occurs earlier and earlier, their maximum progressively shifting before tc . This\nshift becomes visible only for an effective noise amplitude larger than unity, that is physically outside the range of noise values.\nConsider the case of small effective noise, where the correlation function and the spectrum of the fluctuations x(t) \u2212 x0 (t)\nare well described by the correlation function and spectrum of x1 (t), respectively. The calculation of these functions requires\nsome care because the system is not in a statistically steady state. Therefore the spectral density of the fluctuations depends on\ntime and the correlation function\n\u0393x1 (t, \u03c4 ) = hx1 (t \u2212 \u03c4 /2)x1 (t + \u03c4 /2)i,\ndepends both on t and on \u03c4 .

Both widths show an interesting\nbehavior which provides the same result. Consider first the left curve, obtained for the parameter value a = 10\u22129 , typical for\nearthquake phenomena, as discussed above. The figure displays a strong increase of the correlation time \u03c4x of x(t) \u2212 x0 (t) in\nthe intermediate time range, reaching its maximum value at time t \u223c 1.5 t0 (which was estimated as a couple of hours before\nthe earthquake), then it displays a rapid decrease before the critical time tc (a) \u223c 2340. In addition, we observe a slow growth\nof \u03c4x as t increases from large negative values (not shown in the figure), \u03c4x increasing by a factor ten for \u2212100t0 < t < 0, that\ncorresponds to a time interval about one week. Such a remarkable behavior should be used as precursor. The increase of the\ncorrelation length before the catastrophe can be understood when looking at the formal expression (24). The second derivative\nof the potential vanishes at t = t0 , that leads to the flatness of g(t) in the whole domain 0 < t < tc (a), as shown in figure (4-a).\nFigure (4-b) shows that the \"precursor time\" (see caption) is given by the relation\ntprec \u223c 2t0\n\n(27)\n\nwhich corresponds to about 4 hours.\n\ngHtL\n-300\n\n-200\n\nLogHprecursor timeL\n100\n\n-100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nt\n4\n\n-20\n\n3\n-40\n\n2\n-60\n\n1\n-80\n\nLogHaL\n-10\n\n-100\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n-1\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Flat shape of g(t) before the critical time, for a = 10\u22129 , or t0 = 1000 ; (b) \"Precursor time\" tprec = tc (a) \u2212 t1/3 versus a, in\nLog scale ( t1/3 being the time where the width is 13 of its maximum value, before the catastrophe time tc (a)).\n\nAs for the spectral width, the result is just the opposite: it continuously decreases from large negative time, until the time\nt \u223c 1.5t0 , where it suddenly grows. The slow decrease of \u2206f corresponding to a slow shift of the spectrum towards low\nfrequencies, is followed by a rapid spectral broadening at the end of the intermediate domain, before the transition time tc (a).\nThe two stages of the width change are both important, because they occur before the transition.\nThe growth of the fluctuations and their shift to lower frequencies can be understood as follows. As the transition approaches\nthe potential V (x, t) becomes flatter and flatter, making weaker and weaker the restoring force toward the equilibrium. Therefore,\nat constant noise source, the amplitude of the fluctuations driven by this noise source will grow because the damping is less and\nless efficient. Moreover, the typical time scale for this damping will get larger and larger because of the decreasing stiffness of\nthe potential, which will favour noise at lower and lower frequencies.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgments\n\nJean-Louis LeMou\u00ebl and Cl\u00e9ment Narteau are gratefully acknowledged for stimulating discussions, and Patrice Fromy for his\ntechnical help.\n\n[1] C.
