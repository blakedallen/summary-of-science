INTRODUCTION\n\nThe observation of solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits in various experiments such as\nChlorine, Super-Kamiokande, Gallex, SAGE and SNO together with recent results from the\nK2K and Kamland [1] experiments that involve terrestrial neutrinos have now conclusively\nestablished that neutrinos have mass and they mix among themselves. In conjunction with\nnegative results from CHOOZ and PALO-VERDE reactor experiments, one now seems to\nhave a clear idea about the mixing pattern among the three generations of neutrinos. Of\nthe three angles needed to characterize these mixings i.e. \u03b812 , \u03b823 and \u03b813 , the first two are\nlarge and the third is small [2].\nAs far as the mass pattern is concerned,\nthere are three distinct possibilities: (i)\nq\nq \"normal\n2\nhierarchy\" where m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 \u2243 \u2206mA ; (ii) inverted one where m1 \u2243 m2 \u2243 \u2206m2A \u226b\nm3 ; (iii) quasi-degenerate, where m1 \u2243 m2 \u2243 m3 .\n1\n\n\fThe normal hierarchy is similar to what is observed in the quark sector although the\ndegree of hierarchy for neutrinos is much less pronounced. Understanding this difference is\nsomewhat of a challenge although grand unified theories generally imply similar hierarchies\nfor quarks as well as neutrinos and therefore provide a partial explanation of this challenge.\nThe observed mixing pattern for leptons however, is totally different from what is observed for quarks, posing a much more severe theoretical challenge, in particular for grand\nunified theories that unify quarks and leptons. Both these questions have been the subject\nof many papers [3] that propose different approaches to solve these problems. Our goal in\nthis paper is to address them in the context of a minimal SO(10) model, which provides an\ninteresting way to resolve both the mass and mixing problems without making any extra\nassumptions, other than what is needed to derive the supersymmetric standard model from\nSO(10).\nThe first question one may ask is: why SO(10) ? The answer is that we seek a theory\nof neutrino mixings that must be part of a larger framework that explains other puzzles of\nthe standard model such as the origin of matter, the gauge hierarchy problem, dark matter\netc. As is explained below, supersymmetric SO(10) has the right features to satisfy all the\nabove requirements.\nSupersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) seems to be a very natural\nframework to solve both the gauge hierarchy as well as the dark matter problems. The\nnonrenormalization theorem for the superpotential solves an important aspect of the gauge\ngauge hierarchy problem i.e. the radiative corrections do not destabilize the weak scale. As\nfar as the dark matter puzzle goes, if one adds the extra assumption that R-parity defined\nas R = (\u22121)3(B\u2212L)+2S is also a good symmetry of MSSM, then the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, the neutralino is stable and can play the role of dark matter. In fact currently all\ndark matter search experiments are geared to finding the neutralino. An added bonus of\nMSSM is that it also provides a nice way to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking.\nTurning to neutrinos, the seesaw mechanism [4] which is the simplest way to understand\nsmall neutrino masses, requires a right handed neutrino with a large Majorana mass MR .\nPresent data require that MR has to be very high and yet much smaller than the Planck mass.\nThis would suggest that perhaps there is a new symmetry whose breaking is responsible\nfor MR ; since symmetry breaking scales do not receive destabilizing radiative corrections\nin supersymmetric theories, one has a plausible explanation of why MR \u226a MP l . One\nsuch symmetry is local B-L symmetry [5], whose breaking scale vBL could be responsible\nfor MR (i.e. MR = f vBL ) since the righthanded neutrino has nonzero B-L charge and is\nmassless in the symmetry limit. The formula for neutrino masses in the seesaw model is\nm2D\ngiven by m\u03bd \u223c \u2212 f vBL\n; therefore their smallness is now very easily understood as a result\n1\nof mD \u226a vBL . The smallest grand unification group that incorporates both the features\nrequired for the seesaw mechanism i.e. a righthanded neutrino and the local B-L symmetry\nis SO(10).\n\n1 The\n\nsymmetry could also be a global symmetry without conflicting with what is known at low\nenergies [6]; but we do not discuss it here.\n\n2\n\n\fSecondly, the seesaw mechanism also goes well with the idea of grand unification. It\nis well known that if MSSM remains the only theory till a very high scale, then the three\ngauge couplings measured at LEP and SLC at the weak scale can unify to a single coupling\naround MU \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV. Curiously enough, naive estimates for the seesaw scale needed\nto understand the atmospheric neutrino oscillation within a quark-lepton unified picture\nimplies that the seesaw scale must be around vBL \u2265 1015 GeV. Close proximity of vBL and\nMU suggests that one should seek an understanding of the neutrino masses and mixings\nwithin a supersymmetric grand unified theory. While this already makes the case for SUSY\nSO(10) [7] as a candidate theory for neutrino masses quite a strong one, there is an additional\nfeature that make the case even stronger.\nThis has to do with understanding a stable dark matter naturally in MSSM. From the\ndefinition of R-parity given above, it is clear that in the limit of exact SO(10) symmetry,\nR-parity is conserved [8]. However, since ultimately, SO(10) must break down to MSSM,\none has to investigate whether in this process R-parity remains intact or breaks down. This\nis intimately connected with how the right handed neutrino masses arise (or how local B-L\nsubgroup of SO(10) is broken). It turns out that the B-L symmetry needs to be broken by\n126 Higgs representation [9\u201311] rather than 16 Higgses [12] as explained below.\nIt was pointed out in [9] that SO(10) with one 126 and one 10 is very predictive in\nthe neutrino sector without any extra assumptions, while at the same time correcting a\nbad mass relation among charged fermions predicted by the minimal SU(5) model, i.e.\nm\u03bc (MU ) = ms (MU ). There is a partial unification of flavor structure between the neutrino\nand quark sectors and since all Yukawa coupling parameters of the model are determined\nby charged fermion masses and mixings, there are no free parameters (besides an overall\nscale) in the neutrino mass matrix. It is therefore a priori not at all clear that the neutrino\nparameters predicted by the model would agree with observations. In fact the initial analysis\nof neutrino mixings in this model that used the type I seesaw formula and did not include CP\nphases did predict neutrino mixings that are now in disagreement with data. In subsequent\npapers [13,10,14\u201316], this idea was analyzed ( in some cases by including more than one 10\nHiggses) to see how close one can come to observations. The conclusion now appears to be\nthat one needs CP violating phases to achieve this goal [16]2 .\nAnother approach is to use the type II seesaw formula for neutrino masses [18] i.e.\nM\u03bd \u2243 f\n\n2\nvwk\nm2D\n\u2212\n.\n\u03bbvB\u2212L f vB\u2212L\n\n(1)\n\nIn models which have asymptotic parity symmetry such as left-right or SO(10) models, it is\nthe type II seesaw that is more generic.\nA very interesting point about this approach, noted recently [19], is that use of the type\nII seesaw formula for the two generation subsector of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 , and dominance of the first\nterm leads to a very natural understanding of maximal atmospheric mixing angle due to\nb \u2212 \u03c4 mass convergence at high scale.\nWhether the above idea does indeed lead to a realistic picture for all three neutrino\ngenerations was left unanswered in ref. [19]. To answer this question, a complete three\n\n2 For\n\na different class of SO(10) models with 126 Higgs fields see [17]\n\n3\n\n\fgeneration analysis of this model was carried out in [20] where it was pointed out that the\nsame b \u2212 \u03c4 convergence condition that led to large atmospheric mixing angle also leads to\na large solar angle and also a small \u03b813 . Furthermore, it also resolves the mass puzzle for\nneutrinos\n(i.e. a milder hierarchy for neutrinos than that for quarks) since it predicts that\nq\n2\n\u2206m\u2299 /\u2206m2A \u2243 \u03bb \u2243 0.22, where \u03bb is the small quark mixing parameter in the Wolfenstein\nparametrization of the CKM matrix. As there are no free Yukawa coupling parameters in\nthe neutrino sector, it is quite amazing that all the neutrino parameters can come out in\nthe right range.\nIn the analysis of ref. [20], CP violating phases were set to zero. It was implicitly assumed\nthat all known CP violating processes in this model would arise from the supersymmetry\nbreaking sector which would then make the model completely realistic even though it does\nnot have the conventional CKM CP violation. CP violation is however a fundamental\nproblem in particle physics and its origin at the moment is unclear. It is therefore of interest\nto see (i) whether the minimal SUSY SO(10) can remain predictive for neutrinos even after\nthe parameters in the model are allowed to become complex, thereby ushering in CP violation\ninto the quark sector in a direct way and (ii) if any other useful information on the nature\nof CP violation for both quarks and leptons can be gained in this model.\nTo study CP violation in this model, we generalize our earlier analysis to make all\nYukawa coupling parameters as well as the vacuum expectation values (vev) complex. One\nmight suspect that since this will bring in several new parameters, the model may lose its\npredictivity. We find that this is not so. We have seven phases, one of which can play the\nrole of the CKM phase. Due to the presence of a sum rule involving the charged lepton and\nquark masses, despite the presence of extra phases, the model still remains predictive and\npretty much leads to the same predictions with minor changes as in the case without phase.\nAssuming that b-tau mass convergence leads to maximal neutrino mixing, constrains\nthree of the phases to be equal and matching the electron mass fixes two others. The\nremaining arbitrary phase is associated with the up quark, whose tiny mass keeps this phase\nwell hidden from this discussion. The CKM phase however turns out to be outside the one \u03c3\nregion of the present central value in the standard model fits [21]. That means that one will\nneed some contributions to the observed CP violation from the SUSY breaking sector. We\nthen observe that if we include the higher dimensional contributions to the fermion masses\nwhich were ignored before, only for the first generation (which can be done naturally using\nan R-symmetry), this introduces only one new parameter which relaxes the electron mass\nconstraint but does not affect the neutrino sector. We can maintain a CKM phase equal to\nthat given by the standard model fit (of about 600 ).\nAn important outcome of this analysis is that in both cases, to first order in Cabibbo\nangle \u03bb, the leptonic mixing matrix is CP conserving, which can therefore be used to test\nthe model.\nIn our opinion, these observations have lifted the minimal SO(10) with 126 to a realistic\ngrand unification model for all forces and matter and ought therefore be considered as a\nserious candidate for physics beyond the standard model up to the scale of 1016 GeV. Just\nlike the minimal SUSY SU(5) grand unified theory could be tested in proton decay searches,\nthis minimal version of SO(10) can be tested by future neutrino experiments. Important\nexperiments for this purpose are the planned long base line experiments which will provide\na high precision measurement of the mixing parameter \u03b813 (also called Ue3 ) to the level of\n4\n\n\f0.1 or less.\nThis paper is organized as follows: we start in sec. 2 with a few introductory remarks\nabout minimal SO(10) with 126 Higgses; we then sketch a derivation of the type II seesaw\nformula in sec. 3 and show how b\u2212\u03c4 convergence leads to an understanding of large neutrino\nmixings; in sec 4, we discuss the minimal SO(10) model with all couplings and vevs real and\ndiscuss the prediction for neutrinos. Section 4 gives more details of our earlier paper [20]\nand gives an analytic explanation of the constraints on the model parameters. In sec. 5, we\ndiscuss the effects of including the most general form of CP violating phases and present our\npredictions for neutrino masses and mixings without the higher dimensional operators; in\nthis section, we also comment on the implication of including higher dimensional operators.\nIn sec. 7, we summarize our results and present our conclusions.\nII. A MINIMAL SO(10) MODEL\n\nIn any SO(10) model, one needs several multiplets to break the symmetry down to\nSU(3)c \u00d7 U(1)em . Usually, to break the SO(10) group down to the Pati-Salam group\nSU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(4)c or to the left-right group SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L \u00d7 SU(3)c ,\none needs either 54 or 54\u229545 Higgs multiplets [10]. Then to break SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L\ndown to U(1)Y , one can employ either 16 + 16 or 126 + 126 pair since both these models\nhave standard model singlet and B-L6=0 fields in them. The reason for having the complex\nconjugate is to maintain supersymmetry down to the electroweak scale. Finally to break the\nstandard model group, 10 is used. Thus one needs always at least five Higgs multiplets in\nmost constructions of SO(10) model. One could replace 54+45 pair by a 210 representation [22], reducing the number of multiplets required to four. The neutrino results that we\ndiscuss are not affected by the choice of Higgses that affect the breaking in the first stage\nbut are crucially dependent on how one implements the subsequent ones.\nIn our model, we will use 126 + 126 to break B-L symmetry for the following reasons.\nA. R-parity and 16 vs. 126\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, an important argument in favor of MSSM being the\nTeV scale theory is the possibility that the lightest SUSY partner can play the role of dark\nmatter. In fact a lot of resources are being devoted to discover the supersymmetric dark\nmatter particle. For MSSM to provide such a dark matter particle, it is important that it has\nR-parity conservation. The MSSM by itself does not have R-parity and ad hoc symmetries\nare stuck into the MSSM to guarantee the existence of stable dark matter. SO(10) provides\nan interesting way to guarantee automatic R-parity conservation without invoking any ad\nhoc symmetry as we see below.\nThe crucial question is whether B-L subgroup is broken by a (i) 16-dimensional Higgs\nfield [12] or (ii) 126-dimensional ones [9\u201311].\nIn case (i), B-L symmetry is broken by a Higgs field (the \u03bdR -like Higgs field in 16) which\nhas B \u2212 L = 1. If one looks at higher dimensional contributions to the superpotential of the\nc\nc\n, uc dc dc \u03bdH\netc\nform 163m 16H , in terms of the MSSM superfields they have the form QLdc \u03bdH\nc c c\nc\nwhere Q, L, u , d , e are the matter superfields of the MSSM. The \u03bdH field is the Higgs field\n5\n\n\fc\nin 16 that breaks B-L via < \u03bd\u0303H\n>= vBL . After symmetry breaking, these nonrenormalizable\ncouplings will induce R-parity breaking terms of MSSM such as QLdc and uc dc dc etc with\na slightly suppressed coupling i.e. vBL /MP l \u2243 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22123. This suppression is not enough\nto let the neutralino play the role of cold dark matter - not to mention the fact that it leads\nto extremely rapid proton decay.\nIt is sometimes argued that the final theory from which this effective SO(10) model\nemerges may have additional local U(1)X symmetries that will prevent these dangerous\nhigher dimensional terms. To see what this implies, one can imagine a Higgs field X which\nis charged under U(1)X and has vev of order of the GUT scale. The leading order operator\nthat will keep\nthe\u0011 theory safe from proton decay problem has to involve an operator of the\n\u0010\n5\nform uc dc dc MXP l and similarly for other operators. This means that the U(1)X charge of\nX and the operator uc dc dc must be arranged in a very specific way, which leads to another\nkind of naturalness problem.\nOn the other hand if B-L symmetry of SO(10) is broken by a 126 Higgs field, as in case\n(ii), the B \u2212 L 6= 0 and standard model singlet field that breaks B-L has B-L=2. As a result\nafter this Higgs field acquires a vev, a Z2 subgroup of B-L still survives and it keeps R-parity\nas a good symmetry. This has been established by a detailed analysis of the superpotential\nin Ref. [11]. This not only forbids dangerous baryon number violating terms but also allows\nfor the existence of a neutralino dark matter without the need for any additional symmetry.\nWe will therefore work with an SO(10) model where where the only field that breaks B-L is\nin the 126-dimensional representation.\n\nB. Mass sumrules in minimal SO(10)\n\nA second advantage of using 126 multiplet instead of 16 is that it unifies the charged\nfermion Yukawa couplings with the couplings that contribute to righthanded as well as\nlefthanded neutrino masses, as long as we do not include nonrenormalizable couplings in\nthe superpotential. This can be seen as follows [9,10]: it is the set 10+126 out of which\nthe MSSM Higgs doublets emerge; the later also contains the multiplets (3, 1, 10) + (1, 3, 10)\nwhich are responsible for not only lefthanded but also the right handed neutrino masses in\nthe type II seesaw formula. We explain this below. Therefore all fermion masses in the\nmodel are arising from only two sets of 3 \u00d7 3 Yukawa matrices one denoting the 10 coupling\nand the other denoting 126 coupling.\nIn view of the above remarks, the SO(10) model that we will work with in this paper has\nthe following features: It contains three spinor 16-dim. superfields that contain the matter\nfields (denoted by \u03c8a ); two Higgs fields, one in the 126-dim representation (denoted by \u2206)\nthat breaks the SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L symmetry down to U(1)Y and another in the 10-dim\nrepresentation (H) that breaks the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y down to U(1)em . The original SO(10)\nmodel can be broken down to the left-right group SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L by 54 \u2295 45\nHiggs fields denoted by S and A respectively.\nTo see what this model implies for fermion masses, let us explain how the MSSM doublets\nemerge and the consequent fermion mass sumrules they lead to. As noted, the 10 and 126\ncontain two (2,2,1) and (2,2,15) submultiplets (under SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(4)c subgroup\nof SO(10)). We denote the two pairs by \u03c6u,d and \u2206u,d . At the GUT scale, by some doublet-\n\n6\n\n\ftriplet splitting mechanism these two pairs reduce to the MSSM Higgs pair (Hu , Hd ), which\ncan be expressed in terms of the \u03c6 and \u2206 as follows:\nHu = cos \u03b1u \u03c6u + ei\u03b3u sin \u03b1u \u2206u\nHd = cos \u03b1d \u03c6d + ei\u03b3d sin \u03b1d \u2206d\n\n(2)\n\nThe details of the doublet-triplet splitting mechanism that leads to the above equation are\nnot relevant for what follows and we do not discuss it here. As in the case of MSSM, we will\nassume that the Higgs doublets Hu,d have the vevs < Hu0 >= v sin \u03b2 and < Hd0 >= v cos \u03b2.\nIn orders to discuss fermion masses in this model, we start with the SO(10) invariant\nsuperpotential giving the Yukawa couplings of the 16 dimensional matter spinor \u03c8i (where\ni, j denote generations) with the Higgs fields H10 \u2261 10 and \u2206 \u2261 1263 .\nWY = hij \u03c8i \u03c8j H10 + fij \u03c8i \u03c8j \u2206\n\n(3)\n\nSO(10) invariance implies that h and f are symmetric matrices. We ignore the effects coming\nfrom the higher dimensional operators, as we mentioned earlier.\nBelow the B-L breaking (seesaw) scale, we can write the superpotential terms for the\ncharged fermion Yukawa couplings as:\nW0 = hu QHu uc + hd QHd dc + he LHd ec + \u03bcHu Hd\n\n(4)\n\nhu = h cos \u03b1u + f ei\u03b3u sin \u03b1u\nhd = h cos \u03b1d + f ei\u03b3d sin \u03b1d\nhe = h cos \u03b1d \u2212 3f ei\u03b3d sin \u03b1d\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\nIn general \u03b1u 6= \u03b1d and this difference is responsible for nonzero CKM mixing angles. In\nterms of the GUT scale Yukawa couplings, one can write the fermion mass matrices (defined\nas Lm = \u03c8\u0304L M\u03c8R ) at the seesaw scale as:\nMu\nMd\nMe\nM\u03bd D\n\n= h\u0304 + f \u0304\n= h\u0304r1 + f \u0304r2\n= h\u0304r1 \u2212 3r2 f \u0304\n= h\u0304 \u2212 3f \u0304\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nh\u0304 = h\u2217 cos \u03b1u sin \u03b2\nf \u0304 = f \u2217 ei\u03b3u sin \u03b1u sin \u03b2\ncos \u03b1d\nr1 =\ncot \u03b2\ncos \u03b1u\nsin \u03b1d\nr2 = ei(\u03b3d \u2212\u03b3u )\ncot \u03b2\nsin \u03b1u\n\n3 For\n\nalternative neutrino mass models with 126 representations see [17].\n\n7\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe mass sumrules in Eq. (7) provide the first important ingredient in discussing the\nneutrino sector. In the case without any phases in the Yukawa sector, they determine\ncompletely the input parameters of the model.\nTo see this let us note that Eq. (7) leads to the following sumrule involving the charged\nlepton, up and down quark masses:\nk M\u0303l = r M\u0303d + M\u0303u\n\n(8)\n\nwhere k and r are complex numbers which are functions of the symmetry breaking parameters of the model; the mass matrices Mu,d,l are general symmetric complex matrices. In\nthe Eq. (8), tilde denotes the fact that we have made the mass matrices dimensionless by\ndividing them by the heaviest mass of the species i.e. up quark mass matrix by mt , down\nquark mass matrix by mb etc.\nWe now proceed to do the phase counting in the model. First we absorb the phase of r\nby redefining k, so that r becomes real. We then choose a basis so that Md is diagonal and\nreal. The (u, c, t) basis is appropriately defined so that the weak current is diagonal in this\nbasis and Mu is still a general complex symmetric matrix wherein the CKM mixing matrix\nis buried. We can now write Mu = V T Mudiag V where V is a general 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix,\nwhich has three real rotation angles and six phases. Three of these phases can be put into\nthe diagonal elements of the down quark mass matrix and two can be put into the three\ndiagonal elements of Mu and one remaining phase is in the CKM matrix. The V matrix can\nnow be parameterized as V = Pd UCKM Pu , where Pu,d are diagonal unitary matrices.\nInput parameters in the model:\n\u2022 We have two parameters (k, r) and six phases constrained by the fact that they must\nreproduce the correct charged lepton masses and lead to large neutrino mixings via\nb \u2212 \u03c4 mass convergence.\n\u2022 The other degrees of freedom arise from the fact that the quark masses and mixings\nextrapolated to the GUT scale have uncertainties in them.\n\u2022 We have the freedom to change the sign of the quark and lepton masses, which amount\nto to a redefinition of the fermion fields by a \u03b35 transformation.\nWe use the above input parameters to get the correct charged lepton masses and subsequently via the type II seesaw (explained below) to predict the neutrino mixings. As it is\napparent, this is a highly nontrivial task and restricts the parameter space of the theory i.e.\nvalues of quark and charged lepton masses at the GUT scale, very strongly.\nIII. TYPE II SEESAW FORMULA AND MAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXINGS\n\nIn this section, we explain the type II seesaw formula that we use in discussing neutrino\nmixings. The familiar seesaw formula (type I seesaw) for small neutrino masses [4] is given\nby\nM\u03bd = \u2212M\u03bd D MN\u22121R M\u03bdTD\n8\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere MNR = f vBL , vBL being the scale of local B-L symmetry breaking. On the other\nhand, it was pointed out in 1980 that in theories with asymptotic parity conservation, the\nseesaw formula has an additional contribution [18] i.e.\nM\u03bd \u2243 f vL \u2212 M\u03bd D (f vBL )\u22121 M\u03bdTD .\n\n(10)\n\nv2\n\nwhere vL = \u03bbvwk\n. Note that the f matrix is common to both terms. It is possible to find\nBL\ndifferent regions of parameter space where the first or the second term may dominate. For\nexample, it was shown in Ref. [23] that when parity symmetry is broken at a much higher\nscale than the SU(2)R symmetry (e.g. by breaking SO(10) via 210 Higgs field), one recovers\nthe type I seesaw formula.\nIn this section, we would like to make two points: first, the origin of the first term in the\nSO(10) theory under consideration and secondly, conditions under which the first term may\ndominate the neutrino mass.\nIn our model, the mass of the right handed neutrino comes from a renormalizable term\nof the form \u03bd c \u03bd c \u22060R where \u22060R is the neutral member of an SU(2)R triplet; parity symmetry\nof the theory then implies that there must be a coupling in the theory of the theory of the\nleft handed neutrino of the form \u03bd\u03bd\u22060L , where \u22060L is the neutral member of the left handed\ntriplet. If the \u22060L has a vev, then we get type II seesaw formula.\nTo show that in our model, \u22060L has a vev, let us look at the gauge invariant Higgs field\nterms in the superpotential. First we note the decomposition of the 126 under the group\nSU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(4)c :\n126 = (1, 1, 6) \u2295 (2, 2, 15) \u2295 (3, 1, 10) \u2295 (1, 3, 10)\n\n(11)\n\nThe SU(2)L triplet that contributes to the type II seesaw formula is contained in the multiplet \u2206L \u2261 (3, 1, 10) and it couples to the left handed multiplet \u03c8 \u2261 (2, 1, 4) of the 16\ndimensional SO(10) spinor that contains the matter fermions i.e. \u03c8L \u03c8L \u2206L . On the other\nhand the mass of the RH neutrinos comes from the coupling of \u2206R \u2261 (1, 3, 10) submultiplet\nof 126 to the right handed lepton doublets.\nThe vev of the neutral member of \u2206R breaks the B-L symmetry and gives mass to\nthe RH neutrinos. This generates the second term in the type II seesaw formula. To\nsee how the \u22060L vev arises, note that the general superpotential of the model contains\nterms of type \u03bb1 1262 * 54 and \u03bb2 10 * 10 * 54. In the Higgs potential, this generates a\nterm (from |F54 |2 ) of the form 10 * 10 * 126 * 126. In this expression, there is a term of the\nform \u03c6(2, 2, 1)2\u2206L (3, 1, 10)\u2206R(1, 3, 10) with a coefficient \u03bb1 \u03bb2 . Furthermore, in the Higgs\npotential, there is a mass term for \u2206L (3, 1, 10) of the form \u03bc2\u2206 + \u03bb3 vU2 , where vU is the GUT\nscale. On minimizing the potential, these two terms lead to a vev for the SU(2)L triplet\n2 v\n\u03bb \u03bb vwk\nBL\n\u03c3L \u2261< \u22060L >\u2243 1\u03bc22+\u03bb\n2 .\n3 vU\n\u2206\n2\nIt is now clear that if we choose \u03bb3 such that \u03bc2\u2206 + \u03bb3 vU2 \u226a vBL\n, then the entries in the\nsecond matrix in the type II seesaw formula can much smaller than the first term. When\nthis happens, then Eq. (6) can be used to derive the sumrule\nM\u2217\u03bd = a(Ml \u2212 Md )\nThis equation is key to our discussion of the neutrino masses and mixings.\n9\n\n(12)\n\n\fA. Maximal neutrino mixings from type II seesaw\n\nUsing Eq. (12) in second and third generation sector, one can understand the results of\n[19] in a heuristic manner as follows. The known hierarchical structure of quark and lepton\nmasses as well as the known small mixings for quarks suggest that the matrices Ml,d for the\nsecond and third generation have the following pattern\nMl \u2248 m\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\nMq \u2248 mb\n\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\u03bb2\n1\n!\n\u03bb2\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03bb \u223c 0.22 (the Cabibbo angle) as is required by low energy observations. It is well\nknown that in supersymmetric theories, when low energy quark and lepton masses are\nextrapolated to the GUT scale, one gets approximately that mb \u2243 m\u03c4 . One then sees from\nthe above sumrule for neutrino masses Eq. (12) that all entries for the neutrino mass matrix\nare of same order \u03bb2 leading very naturally to the atmospheric mixing angle to be large.\nThus one has a natural understanding of the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle. No\nextra symmetries are assumed for this purpose.\nFor this model to be a viable one for three generations, one must show that the same\nb \u2212 \u03c4 mass convergence at GUT scale also explains the large solar angle \u03b812 and a small \u03b813 .\nThis has been demonstrated in a recent paper [20].\nTo see how this comes about, let us ignore the CP violating phases and recall Eq. (8).\nNote that in the basis where the down quark mass matrix is diagonal, all the quark mixing\nT\neffects are then in the up quark mass matrix i.e. Mu = UCKM\nMud UCKM . Using the\nWolfenstein parametrization for quark mixings, we can conclude that that we have\nMd\n\n\u03bb4\n\uf8ec 5\n\u2248 mb \uf8ed \u03bb\n\u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb5\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\u03bb3\n\uf8f7\n\u03bb2 \uf8f8\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(14)\n\nand Ml and Md have roughly similar pattern due to the sum rule 8. In the above equation,\nthe matrix elements are supposed to give only the approximate order of magnitude. As we\nextrapolate the quark masses to the GUT scale, due to the fact that mb \u2212 m\u03c4 \u2248 m\u03c4 \u03bb2 for\nsome value of tan \u03b2, the neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd = c(Md \u2212 Ml ) takes roughly the form\n[24]\nM\u03bd\n\n\u03bb4\n\uf8ec 5\n= c(Md \u2212 Ml ) \u2248 m0 \uf8ed \u03bb\n\u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb5\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\u03bb3\n\u03bb2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n2\n\u03bb\n\uf8f6\n\n(15)\n\nIt is then easy to see from this mass matrix that both the \u03b812 (solar angle) and \u03b823 (the\natmospheric angle) are large. Furthermore, if only terms of \u03bb2 are kept, then, m3 \u2248 c\u03bb2 and\nin the limit of maximal atmospheric mixing and both m2 and m1 vanish. As soon as terms\nof order \u03bb3 , m1,2 pick up mass and then one has m2 /m3 \u2248 \u03bb. This then naturally explains\nthe milder hierarchy among neutrinos compared to that among quarks.\nThe detailed predictions of the model such as the magnitudes of these angles and neutrino\nmasses m1,2 depend on the details of the quark masses at the GUT scale and we discuss it\nin the following sections for different cases.\n10\n\n\fIV. PREDICTIONS FOR NEUTRINO MIXINGS WITHOUT ANY CP PHASES\nIN THE MASS SUMRULES\n\nLet us first consider the case where the Yukawa couplings in the superpotential and the\nvevs of doublet Higgs are all real. This case was considered in our earlier paper [20]. In this\ncase all CP phases needed for understanding the observed kaon and B CP violation arise\nfrom the supersymmetry breaking sector. We can start by solving for the parameters k and\nr in Eq. (8) and find the range of quark masses for which the charged lepton masses come\nout right. We then use the values of k and r as well as the quark masses to get the neutrino\nmasses and mixings using Eq. (12).\nWhile all our predictions are done via detailed numerical analysis using Mathematica, in\nthis section we provide a qualitative discussion of the nature of the constraints on the model\nparameters. The qualitative discussion brings out several things clearly:\n(i) while the masses of tau lepton and muon fix the values of k and r, getting electron\nmass is nontrivial and requires fine tuning for quark masses and also the Vub parameter\nwithin the range allowed by present data.\n(ii) Secondly, we derive an approximate form for the neutrino mass matrix and and show\nhow the model generally tends to predict values of Ue3 close to its present upper limit.\nTo find k and r numerically, we need to specify the values of the quark and lepton masses\nas well as the CKM mixings extrapolated to the GUT scale. These have been discussed\nextensively in literature. We use the values from the paper of Das and Parida [25] and are\ngiven in Table.\ninput observable tan \u03b2 = 10\ntan \u03b2 = 55\n+0.13\nmu (MeV)\n0.72\u22120.14\n0.72+0.12\n\u22120.14\n+15.10\nmc (MeV)\n210.32+19.00\n210.50\n\u221221.22\n\u221221.15\n+30.26\n+69.28\nmt (GeV)\n82.43\u221214.76\n95.14\u221220.65\nmd (MeV)\n1.50+0.42\n1.49+0.41\n\u22120.23\n\u22120.22\n+4.17\nms (MeV)\n29.94+4.30\n29.81\n\u22124.54\n\u22124.49\n+0.14\n+0.48\nmb (GeV)\n1.06\u22120.08\n1.41\u22120.19\nme (MeV)\n0.3585\n0.3565\n+0.0578\nm\u03bc (MeV)\n75.6715\u22120.0501 75.2938+1912\n\u22120.0515\n+0.0443\nm\u03c4 (GeV)\n1.2922+0.0013\n1.6292\n\u22120.0012\n\u22120.0294\nTaking the 2-3 submatrix of the Eq.

For this\npurpose, let us express the M\u0303l in terms of the small parameter \u03bb \u223c 0.22 (the Cabibbo angle)\nfor a particular choice of mb (MU ) \u2243 1.2 and m\u03c4 \u2243 1.29 as an example:\n\u22131.6\u03bb4 \u00b1 11\u03bb6\n\uf8ec\n6\u03bb5\nM\u0303l = \uf8ed\n4.5\u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\n\u223c 6\u03bb5\n\u22132.1\u03bb2\n3.3\u03bb2\n\n4.5\u03bb3\n\uf8f7\n3.3\u03bb2 \uf8f8\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(17)\n\nwhere we have kept the \u00b1 sign in Ml,11 to reflect the sign freedom in the quark masses.\nAn approximate expression for the electron mass m\u0303e can be obtained from the above\nexpression to be:\n2\nMl,13\nMl,33\n4\n\u2243 \u22131.6\u03bb sgn(md ) \u00b1 sgn(mc )10\u03bb6 \u2212 20\u03bb6\n\nm\u0303e \u2243 Ml,11 \u2212\n\n(18)\n\nSince m\u0303e \u223c \u03bb5 , we need a cancellation between the different terms in the above equation.\nNote that if md < 0 and mc < 0, then we get cancellation between the three terms in the\nabove equation and we can get the right value for the electron mass. It must however be\nstressed that me is reproduced only for particular choice of the bottom and tau masses at\nthe GUT scale and of course these are in the allowed domain but nonetheless they reflect\nthe constraint on the mass parameters for the model to be acceptable. It is impressive that\nit works.\nWe caution that the above discussion is meant to give a flavor of the constraints on\nthe model. In the detailed numerical calculations, the range of parameters where correct\nelectron mass results is larger than what would be implied by the above discussion.\nTo study the neutrino masses and mixings, let us write down the neutrino mass matrix\nin this model:\ny m\u0303d \u2212 z(m\u0303c \u03bb2 + A2 \u03bb6 |\u039b|2\n\uf8ec\nz m\u0303c \u03bb + zA2 \u03bb5 |\u039b|\nM\u03bd = \uf8ed\nzAm\u0303c \u03bb3 + zA\u03bb3 |\u039b|\n\uf8eb\n\n***\ny m\u0303s \u2212 z m\u0303c \u2212 zA2 \u03bb4\n\u2212zA\u03bb2 (1 + m\u0303c )\n\n\uf8f6\n\n**\n\uf8f7\n \u0307**\n\uf8f8\n2 4\ny \u2212 z m\u0303c A \u03bb \u2212 z\n\n(19)\n\nwhere 4y = (mb /m\u03c4 \u2212 r/k) and 4z = k \u22121 and \u039b = (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7). Noting that m\u0303d \u2243 \u03bb4 ,\nm\u0303c \u2243 \u03bb4 , the neutrino mass matrix to leading order takes the form\nM\u03bd\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n0\ny m\u0303s\n= \uf8ed\nzA\u03bb3 |\u039b| zA\u03bb2\n\nzA\u03bb3 |\u039b|\n\uf8f7\nzA\u03bb2 \uf8f8\ny\u2212z\n\uf8f6\n\n(20)\n\nFrom this we see that maximal neutrino mixing as well as the correct mass hierarchy comes\nout. Obviously to get the mixing angles in the desired range, detailed analysis is needed\nand we have carried it out.\nSecondly, one can give an \"analytic\" argument that Ue3 will be close to its present upper\n3\nM\u03bd,13\n\u03c4\u03bb\nlimit. Again Eq. (8) comes in handy. Roughly Ue3 \u2243 M\u03bd,33\n\u2243 mb (MUm)\u2212m\n\u2243 \u03bb.\n\u2212M\u03bd,11\n\u03c4 (MU )\n\n12\n\n\fA. Detailed Numerical Analysis\n\nWe undertake extensive scanning of the parameter space of the model defined by the\nuncertainties in the values of the fermion masses at the GUT scale and the values of k and\nr in the neighborhood of the values given above. We have used the values of the standard\nmodel fermion masses from Table I and the following values for the mixing angles.\nUCKM\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0.974836\n0.222899\n\u22120.00319129\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0.974217\n0.0365224 \uf8f8\n= \uf8ed \u22120.222638\n0.0112498 \u22120.0348928\n0.999328\n\n(21)\n\nThe strategy in our numerical calculations is the following: we focus on the Eq. (8) and\nusing the inputs in the right hand side, we look for the eigenvalues of the charged lepton\nmass matrix in the left hand side to match the observed lepton masses. Since there are only\ntwo unknowns, the second and third generation masses largely fix the parameters k, r as we\njust described. To match the electron mass is nontrivial. The parameters are essentially the\nsigns of the fermion masses and the present uncertainties in the values of the SM fermion\nmasses. After we fix the electron mass it narrows down our parameter range somewhat. We\nthen look for neutrino masses and mixing angles using Eq. (12) in the remaining (small)\nparameter range. Note that due to overall scale freedom of the type II seesaw scale, we\ncannot predict the \u2206m2A . We also do a direct numerical solution. Both the results are in\nagreement.\nThe solutions we present here correspond to me,\u03bc,\u03c4,b,t > 0 and mc,d,s < 0 up to an overall\nsign.\nOur results are displayed in Fig. 1-3 for the case of the supersymmetry parameter\ntan \u03b2 = 10. In these figures, we have restricted ourselves to the range of quark masses for\nwhich the atmospheric mixing angle sin2 2\u03b8A \u2265 0.8. (For presently preferred range of values\nof sin2 2\u03b8A from experiments, see [26]). We then present the predictions for sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 , \u2206m2\u2299\nand Ue3 for the allowed range sin2 2\u03b8A in Fig.1, 2 and 3 respectively. The spread in the\npredictions come from uncertainties in the s, c and the b-quark masses. Note two important\npredictions: (i) sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 \u2265 0.91 and Ue3 \u223c \u00b10.16. The present allowed range for the solar\nmixing angle is 0.7 \u2264 sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 \u2264 0.99 at 3\u03c3 level [26,27]. The solutions for the neutrino\nmixing angles are sensitive to the b quark mass.\nIt is important to note that this model predicts the Ue3 value very close to the present\nexperimentally allowed upper limit and can therefore be tested in the planned long base line\nexperiments which are expected to probe Ue3 down to the level of \u223c 0.05 [28,29].\nV. EFFECT OF CP PHASES ON NEUTRINO MIXINGS\n\nIn this section, we keep the CP phases as described before and look for solutions to the\ncharged lepton equation, Eq. (8) and then use the allowed parameter range to look at the\npredictions of the neutrino masses and mixings. We have seven CP phases including the\nCKM phase. One might think that since there are more parameters in this case, getting a\nsolution will be trivial. We find that actually, it is not so. Let us demonstrate this in an\nanalytic way very crudely and we follow it up with detailed numerical scan to get the mixing\nangles.\n13\n\n\fFIG. 1. The figure shows the range of predictions for sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 and sin2 2\u03b8A for the range of\nquark masses in table I that fit the charged lepton spectrum and where all CP phases are set to\nzero. We required that the ratio \u2206m2\u2299 /\u2206m2A \u2264 0.05. Note that sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 \u2265 0.9 and sin2 2\u03b8A \u2264 0.9.\n\nTo proceed with this analysis, first note that the phases are distributed in Eq.\n(8) as follows. First the down quark mass eigenvalues are chosen to be complex i.e.\n(m\u0303d ei\u03b21 , m\u0303s ei\u03b22 , ei\u03b23 ) and similarly for the up quark sector, there are three phases in the\nmasses (denoted by \u03b1i ). Using 8, we see that\n\nkMl =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nr m\u0303d ei\u03b21 + m\u0303c \u03bb2 ei\u03b12\n+A2 \u03bb6 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)2\nm\u0303c \u03bbei\u03b12 + A2 \u03bb5 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)\nAm\u0303c \u03bb3 ei\u03b12 + A\u03bb3 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)\n\nm\u0303c \u03bbei\u03b12 + A2 \u03bb5 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)\ni\u03b22\n\nr m\u0303s e\n\ni\u03b12\n\n+ m\u0303c e\n\n2 4 i\u03b13\n\n+A \u03bb e\n\nm\u0303c A\u03bb2 ei\u03b12 + A\u03bb2 ei\u03b13\n\nAm\u0303c \u03bb3 ei\u03b12 + A\u03bb3 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)\n2 i\u03b12\n\nm\u0303c A\u03bb e\n\n2 i\u03b13\n\n+ A\u03bb e\n\nrei\u03b23 + m\u0303c A2 \u03bb4 ei\u03b12 + ei\u03b13\n\nwhere we have used the Wolfenstein parametrization for the CKM matrix. Essentially the\neigenvalues of the matrix on the right hand side must match the charged lepton masses.\nNote that as in the case without the CP phase, this will require us to work only in a very\nlimited range of the quark masses. Since now we have to align the phases with the known\nstandard model CKM phase, the constraints are even tighter. The muon and tau masses\ncome out quite easily as in the case without phases discussed in the previous section.\nAs in the CP conserving case, the mass of the electron requires fine tuning as can be\nseen by noting that the 11 entry of Ml is roughly of order \u03bb4 which is about 3 to 4 times\nthe value required to give the correct electron mass. One must therefore have cancellation\n14\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(22)\n\n\fFIG. 2. The figure shows the predictions for sin2 2\u03b8A and \u2206m2\u2299 /\u2206m2A for the range of quark\nmasses and mixings that fit charged lepton masses and where all CP phases in the fermion masses\nare set to zero.\n\nto get the correct me . Before discussing the details of this cancellation, let us first look at\nthe neutrino mass matrix, which looks as follows:\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec\nM\u03bd = \uf8ed\n0\n3\nzA\u03bb (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7)ei\u03b13\n\n0\n0.7y\u03bb2e\u03b22\nzA\u03bb2 ei\u03b13\n\nzA\u03bb3 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7)ei\u03b13\n\uf8f7\nzA\u03bb2 ei\u03b13\n\uf8f8\ni\u03b23\ni\u03b13\nye \u2212 ze\n\uf8f6\n\n(23)\n\nFirst thing to note is that we must have \u03b13 = \u03b23 for b \u2212 \u03c4 unification to lead to maximal\nmixing.\nTo see very qualitatively what value of CKM phase is required for the model to work,\nwe need to analyze the charged lepton masses. As in the CP conserving case, the muon and\nthe tau mass come out for the choice of k \u2248 0.25 and r \u2248 \u2212.75. Let us now discuss the\nelectron mass. For this we first note that we use the Wolfenstein parametrization. The two\nparameters \u03c1 and \u03b7 responsible for the CKM phase are given by the latest data to be [21]\n.12 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 .35 and 0.28 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 .41. Since the charged lepton mass matrix has hierarchical\nstructure, we can deduce an approximate formula for me from the sum rule 8 and using the\nabove values of k and r:\nm\u0303e \u2243 \u22123m\u0303d ei\u03b21 + m\u0303c \u03bb2 ei\u03b12 + A2 \u03bb6 ei\u03b13 (\u039b)2 \u2212 (4A\u03bb6 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7)2 ei\u03b13 ) \u2212 O(\u03bb7 )\n\n(24)\n\nNumerically, to get the correct value for m\u0303e \u2243 0.00028 \u2243 0.6\u03bb5 , we must cancel most of the\nm\u0303d contribution to it i.e. \u22123m\u0303d \u2243 1.3\u03bb4 , from the other terms: these terms get maximized\n15\n\n\fFIG. 3. The figure shows the predictions of the model for sin2 2\u03b8A and Ue3 for the allowed\nrange of parameters in the model as in Fig. 1 and 2. Note that Ue3 is very close to the upper limit\nallowed by the existing reactor experiments.\n\nfor \u03c1 < 0 in which case we get |1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7| \u2243 1.41 so that the last term contributes\n32\u03bb6 \u2243 1.5\u03bb4 . It also determines the arbitrary phases that accompany the quark masses\n\u03b7\nand md < 0. The terms in the electron\nas follows: \u03b21 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 + 2\u03b4 where tan \u03b4 \u2243 1\u2212\u03c1\n5\nmass formula then cancel leading to m\u0303e \u2243 .9\u03bb which is in the rough \"neighborhood\" of\nthe observed value (m\u0303e ). This value of \u03c1 gives a CKM phase which is in the third quadrant\nimplying that in order to understand the observed CP violation i.e. sin 2\u03b2 in B-system, one\nwill need to invoke CP violation from the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses.\nAgain we caution the reader that this is a crude estimate. In detailed numerical analysis,\nwe can get solutions for small positive \u03c1 and one next has to see how these values fit the\nneutrino mixings. Thus combined fit to both electron mass and neutrino mixings works only\nfor negative \u03c1 value which is different from the current standard model CKM fit.\nThe detailed numerical predictions for this model are given in Fig. 4,5 and 6, where we\nhave scanned over all the phases looking for the correct charged lepton masses and acceptable\nneutrino parameters. We have also extended the domain of \u2206m2\u2299 /\u2206m2A to 0.08.\nIn concluding this section, we note that since the main constraints on the model came\nfrom trying to fit the electron mass, it is worth pointing out that one way to avoid these\nconstraints is to include the effects of the higher dimensional operators (HDO) which contribute to the electron mass and is too small to be of relevance in the discussion of other\nmasses. Since\n\u0010\n\u0011usually the contribution of HDO terms in this theory would contribute terms\nMU n\nof order MP l \u2243 10\u22122n , where 3 + n denotes the dimensionality of the HDO. The leading\n16\n\n\fFIG. 4. The figure shows the predictions for sin2 2\u03b8A and sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 for the range of quark masses\nand mixings that fit charged lepton masses in the presence of all CP phases in the fermion masses.\nThe four different panels give the predictions for different values of the CKM phase (tan \u03b4CKM = \u03b7\u03c1 ).\nNote that all these values are outside the one sigma region of the present standard model fit to all\nCP violating data. Note that the case \u03b4CKM = 180 includes the CP conserving case discussed in\nsec. IV.\n\norder HDO must therefore correspond to n = 2. This can be guaranteed for instance by\ndemanding that superpotential is R-odd and all the Higgs fields are R-odd, whereas the\nmatter fields are R-even. We have repeated our computations with the HDO terms mentioned and we find that one can obtain the neutrino mixing parameters in the right range\nfor the standard model value of the CKM phase.\nA. CP violation in leptonic mixings\n\nThe neutrino mass matrix discussed above can be approximately diagonalized to obtain\nthe CP phases in the PMNS matrix. For this purpose, we first diagonalize the charged\nlepton mass matrix. The mixing matrix has a form similar to the CKM matrix. Therefore,\nin the basis where charged leptons are mass eigenstates, the neutrino mass matrix remains\napproximately of the same form as in Eq. (23) i.e.\n\uf8eb\n\nM\u03bd = m0 zA\u03bb2 \uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n0\n0\ni(\u03b4+\u03b13 )\n\nae\n\n0\n(1 + \u01eb)ei\u03b22\nei\u03b13\n17\n\naei(\u03b4+\u03b13 )\n\uf8f7\nei\u03b13\n\uf8f8\n\n(yei\u03b23 \u2212zei\u03b13 )\nzA\u03bb2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(25)\n\n\fFIG. 5. The figure shows the predictions for sin2 2\u03b8A and \u2206m2\u2299 /\u2206m2A for the range of quark\nmasses and mixings that fit charged lepton masses and where all CP phases in the fermion masses\nare kept subject to the condition that b-tau mass convergence is responsible for large neutrino\nmixings, for four different values of the \u03b4CKM .\n\nq\n\n\u03b7\n\u2212 1 and tan \u03b4 \u2243 1\u2212\u03c1\n.

In order to get maximal mixing out of b-tau mass convergence, we must\nhave \u03b13 = \u03b23 and (yei\u03b23 \u2212zei\u03b13 ) \u2243 zA\u03bb2 . Furthermore, to get the solar mass difference right,\nwe must have \u03b22 = \u03b13 . We can therefore take the common phase ei\u03b13 out of the matrix\nwhich leaves us with a simple matrix of the form\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec\nM\u0303\u03bd = \uf8ed 0\naei\u03b4\n\n0\naei\u03b4\n\uf8f7\n(1 + \u01eb)\n1 \uf8f8\n1\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(26)\n\ndiagonalize.

Note that since the PMNS mixing matrix is real to order \u03bb,\ndirect CP violating effects among neutrinos are suppressed and unobservable in near future.\n18\n\n\fFIG. 6. The figure shows the predictions for sin2 2\u03b8A and Ue3 for the range of quark masses\nand mixings that fit charged lepton masses and where all CP phases in the fermion masses are\nincluded, for four different values of \u03b4CKM .\n\nThis is a definite prediction of the minimal SO(10) model. In a sense this is not surprising,\nsince the lepton sector and the quark sector are linked by quark-lepton unification and we\nknow that in the quark sector the CP violating phase is only present in the \u03bb3 order.\nSince the model predicts a large Ue3 , if there is any CP violating phase in the mixing\nmatrix, it has a better chance of being observable; on the other hand this model predicts\nno CP violation, so that the model has a better chance of being falsifiable and strengthens\nthe case for searching for CP violation in neutrino oscillations. It is important to emphasize\nthat the model however enough CP violation to in the right handed neutrino couplings so\nthat one should expect enough baryogenesis.\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the minimal SO(10) model with fermion masses receiving contributions from only one 10 and one 126 Higgs multiplets is fully predictive in\nthe neutrino sector. It predicts all three neutrino mixing angles in agreement with present\ndata but with a value of Ue3 which is very close to the present upper limits from the reactor\nexperiments. This high value of Ue3 provides a test of the model. We also find that the introduction of CP phases in the Yukawa couplings still keeps the model predictive. The CKM\nphase in this case is outside the one \u03c3 region of the present central value in the standard\nmodel suggesting that there are new CP violating contributions from the SUSY breaking\n19\n\n\fsector. We find it interesting that to the leading order in the Cabibbo angle, the leptonic\nCP violation vanishes in spite of the fact that the quark sector has CP violation.\nThere are no additional global symmetries assumed in the analysis. The neutrino data\nonce refined would therefore provide a crucial test of minimal SUSY SO(10) in the same\nway as proton decay was considered a crucial test of minimal SU(5).\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation Grant No. PHY-0099544.\n\n20\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] J.
