Generalisations of Hopf algebras have\nbeen considered, usually motivated by some application in mathematical physics. The\nmost well known example of the generalisations may be quasi-Hopf algebras where the\ncoassociativity of a Hopf algebra is relaxed [2], but at the same time keeping the category\nof modules monoidal. A similar type of relaxation of coassociativity is also found in\ntruncated quasi-Hopf algebras [3] and rational Hopf algebras [4]. This is where the notion\nof a weak co-product was introduced, such that \u2206(1) 6= 1 \u2297 1, and was motivated by\nthe study of symmetries in low dimensional quantum field theory. One problem that\narose was the fact that the dual of these structures was not associative, which led to\nfurther problems in defining crossed products and a double construction [5]. Although\nthese issues have already been addressed in [6] and [7], the question still arose as to the\npossibility of defining a structure which could still provide non-integral dimensions for\nthe quantum field theories in a similar way to the weak quasi-Hopf algebras [3], but at\nthe same time be coassociative. This was the motivation behind defining the weak Hopf\nalgebras of [5, 8, 9]. Since these are not bialgebras, but almost bialgebras [10], there were\nalso axioms required to define a weak antipode, differing slightly from the usual ones of\na Hopf algebra such that the category of finite dimensional modules was still monoidal,\nand also with a rigidity structure defined through a generalised antipode [9]. Another\nquestion then arose as to the possibility of defining a weak antipode on bialgebras. Li has\nintroduced the notion of a weak Hopf algebra to mean a bialgebra on which is defined\nsuch a weak antipode [10, 11]. In this paper, we investigate these weak Hopf algebras as\ndefined by Li.\nThe concept of a weak Hopf algebra is rather new. There are not many examples\nknown, though several have appeared in the literature. One example is given by the\nsemigroup algebra of any regular monoid which gives a generalisation of the well known\ngroup algebra [11]. The other known examples were given in [12] where the authors\npresented two weak Hopf generalisations of the quantised enveloping algebra Uq [sl2 ].\nThe purposes of this paper is two fold. First, we wish to propose some minor adjustments to the examples given in [12]. Second, we extend the construction to the case of\nother known Hopf algebras such as Uq [sln ] [13] and Sweedler's Hopf algebra [14, 15]. It\nis also evident that we can define weak extensions of quantum superalgebras in a similar\nway. As a consequence, we shall have a lot of new nontrivial examples of weak Hopf algebras. We believe that for a deeper understanding of weak Hopf algebras as well having\nsome insight into their applications, it is important to have various examples.\n1\n\n\fThe paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we give a brief summary of the definition\nof weak Hopf algebra. Following that, section 3 has a closer look at the examples given\nin [12] and we propose slightly modified versions of these examples. We then realise\nin section 4 that for Uq [sln ] there is a plethora of examples which leads us to finding\nisomorphisms between structures, thus giving a classification in some sense of weak Hopf\nalgebras corresponding to Uq [sln ]. The following section looks at weak extensions of\nSweedler's famous finite dimensional Hopf algebra, where we also show that with our\nconstruction, in general we can decompose the weak Hopf algebra into a direct sum of\nthe original bialgebra with some other subalgebra. This leads to \"unexpected\" algebra\nisomorphisms between structures in some cases.\n\n2\n\nWeak Hopf algebras\n\nFor the reader's convenience we recall the definition of a weak Hopf algebra in the sense\nof Li and Duplij [10, 12]. Let (H, \u2206, \u03b5, m, u) be a bialgebra over a field K, where \u2206 : H \u2192\nH \u2297 H is the co-product, \u03b5 : H \u2192 K is the co-unit, m : H \u2297 H \u2192 H the product and\nu : K \u2192 H the unit of H. The following properties define H:\nm(m \u2297 id) = m(id \u2297 m),\nm(u \u2297 id) = id = m(id \u2297 u),\n(id \u2297 \u2206)\u2206 = (\u2206 \u2297 id)\u2206,\n(\u03b5 \u2297 id)\u2206 = id = (id \u2297 \u03b5)\u2206,\n(m \u2297 m)(id \u2297 \u03c3 \u2297 id)(\u2206 \u2297 \u2206) = \u2206 \u25e6 m,\n\u03b5 \u2297 \u03b5 = \u03b5 \u25e6 m.\nHere \u03c3 : H \u2297 H \u2192 H \u2297 H is the flip operator \u03c3(h1 \u2297 h2 ) = h2 \u2297 h1 for all h1 , h2 \u2208 H.\nH is a weak Hopf algebra if there is a weak antipode T : H \u2192 H which is an algebra\nhomomorphism satisfying the two conditions\nT \u2217 id \u2217 T = T,\n\n(2.1)\n\nid \u2217 T \u2217 id = id,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith the convolution product \u2217 defined over maps on H by\na \u2217 b \u2261 m(a \u2297 b)\u2206 : H \u2192 H.\nNote that the antipode of a Hopf algebra is a weak antipode due to the fact that\nu \u25e6 \u03b5 : H \u2192 H is the identity of the convolution product \u2217. Recall that S : H \u2192 H is an\n2\n\n\fantipode if it satisfies\nS \u2217 id = u \u25e6 \u03b5,\n\n(2.3)\n\nid \u2217 S = u \u25e6 \u03b5.\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor example, we see that\nS \u2217 id = u \u25e6 \u03b5\n\u21d2 id \u2217 S \u2217 id = id \u2217 u \u25e6 \u03b5\n\u21d2 id \u2217 S \u2217 id = id.\nIn fact S needs only be a left or right antipode, meaning it satisfies only one of the two\nequalities (2.3) or (2.4), in order for it to be a weak antipode.\n\n3\n\nWeak Uq [sl2]\n\nIn this section we give a summary of the examples of weak Uq [sl2 ] presented in [12]. It\nis notable that the defining relations of the \"J-weak\" quantum algebra vslq (2) given in\nthat paper can be simplified, and we give a minor adjustment to this example and show\nthat it is in fact a weak Hopf algebra. We also give one other example generalising Uq [sl2 ]\nwhich uses a mixture of the two examples from [12].\nWe remind the reader that the usual Uq [sl2 ] relations to which we refer, in terms of\nthe four generators E, F, K, K \u22121, are as follows.\nK \u22121 K = KK \u22121 = 1,\nKEK \u22121 = q 2 E,\nKF K \u22121 = q \u22122 F,\nK \u2212 K \u22121\n.\nEF \u2212 F E =\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nThe co-algebra structure (co-product \u2206, co-unit \u03b5) is given by\n\u2206(K \u00b11 ) = K \u00b11 \u2297 K \u00b11 ,\n\u2206(E) = E \u2297 K + 1 \u2297 E,\n\u2206(F ) = F \u2297 1 + K \u22121 \u2297 F,\n\u03b5(E) = \u03b5(F ) = 0,\n\u03b5(K \u00b11 ) = 1.\nIt is clear that when we wish to determine the explicit action of the antipode, we\napply the definition (2.3) and (2.4) to an arbitrary element in the algebra and solve. In\n3\n\n\fall cases we can solve explicitly due to the existence of the invertible group-like elements\n1, K, K \u22121. The obvious first step in generalisation to the weak Hopf case would be to\nattempt to remove the invertibility of these elements. This was the main idea in [12]\nwhen generalising the above definition.\nFirst, all weak extensions of Uq [sl2 ] have generators E, F, K, K satisfying\nKK = KK \u2261 J,\n\n(3.5)\n\nKKK = K, KKK = K,\nK\u2212K\n.\nEF \u2212 F E =\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nIn what follows we usually write the generators with subscripts (following [12]) to differentiate the definitions.\nDefinition 1 (from [12]): wslq (2) is the algebra generated by the four elements Ew ,\nFw , Kw , K w satisfying (3.5,3.6,3.7) along with the relations:\nKw Ew = q 2 Ew Kw ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nK w Ew = q \u22122 Ew K w ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nKw Fw = q \u22122 Fw Kw ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nK w Fw = q 2 Fw K w ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere the invertibility of K and K has been relaxed, and instead of the identity, the element\nJw has been introduced. It can be seen that this element Jw satisfies\naJw = Jw a, \u2200a \u2208 wslq (2).\nTo demonstrate this we check\nEw Jw\n\n(3.5)\n\n=\n(3.8)\n=\n(3.9)\n=\n(3.5)\n=\n\nEw Kw K w\nq \u22122 Kw Ew K w\nKw K w Ew\nJw Ew .\n\n(3.12)\n\nA similar calculation is performed for Fw and the calculations for Kw and K w are trivial.\nAlso note that due to the relations (3.6), Jw is an idempotent. Namely,\nJw2 = Jw .\n\n4\n\n\fThe co-algebra structure is defined as follows. The co-product and co-unit are respectively\ngiven by\n\u2206w (Ew ) = 1 \u2297 Ew + Ew \u2297 Kw ,\n\u2206w (Fw ) = Fw \u2297 1 + K w \u2297 Fw ,\n\u2206w (Kw ) = Kw \u2297 Kw ,\n\u2206w (K w ) = K w \u2297 K w ,\n\u03b5w (Ew ) = \u03b5w (Fw ) = 0,\n\u03b5w (Kw ) = \u03b5w (K w ) = 1.\nIt can be verified that they are both algebra homomorphisms so that\n\u2206w (xy) = \u2206w (x)\u2206w (y)\nand\n\u03b5w (xy) = \u03b5w (x)\u03b5w (y)\nfor all x, y \u2208 wslq (2), thus preserving the defining relations. With this co-product a\ncorresponding weak antipode can be determined by solving equations (2.1) and (2.2) with\nthe above co-product. The only possible weak antipode in this case is\nTw (1) = 1,\nTw (Kw ) = K w ,\nTw (K w ) = Kw ,\nTw (Ew ) = \u2212Ew K w ,\nTw (Fw ) = \u2212Kw Fw .\n\n(3.13)\n\nIt can be shown that Tw is an algebra anti-homomorphism, that is, T (ab) = T (b)T (a).\nNote that with the above bialgebra structure it is not possible to determine an antipode\nin the usual sense. As we mentioned previously, this was the motivation for relaxing (3.1)\nto (3.5) in order to provide weak antipodes which are not antipodes. For example, to\nsolve the equation\nS \u2217 id(K) = \u03b5(K)1 \u21d2 S(K)K = 1,\nwe would need an inverse of the element K.\nAnother possible definition given in [12] is the following.\nDefinition 2 (from [12]): vslq (2) is the algebra generated by the four elements Ev ,\nFv , Kv , K v satisfying (3.5,3.6,3.7) along with the relations:\nKv Ev K v = q 2 Ev ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nKv Fv K v = q \u22122 Fv .\n\n(3.15)\n\n5\n\n\fIn this case, Jv = Kv K v satisfies the relation\nJv a = aJv = a,\n\n(3.16)\n\nfor a = Ev , Fv , Kv , K v (and hence Jv ). To demonstrate, we have\nEv Jv\n\n(3.5)\n\n=\n(3.14)\n=\n(3.6)\n=\n(3.6)\n=\n(3.14)\n=\n(3.5)\n=\n\nEv Kv K v\nq \u22122 Kv Ev K v Kv K v\n(3.14)\nq \u22122 Kv Ev K v ( = Ev )\nq \u22122 Kv K v Kv Ev K v\nKv K v Ev\nJv Ev .\n\nFor the generator Fv , a similar calculation can be done. For the cases Kv and K v ,\nthe calculation is trivial. The most remarkable consequence of this property is that the\nanalogue of defining relation (3.7) presented in [12] which was in the form\nEv Jv Fv \u2212 Fv Jv Ev =\n\nKv \u2212 K v\n,\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\nreduces to (3.7) by the above argument. Therefore in what follows we shall always use\nrelation (3.7) and not the relation above.\nThe co-algebra structure for this second definition is as follows.\n\u2206v (Ev ) = Jv \u2297 Ev + Ev \u2297 Kv ,\n\u2206v (Fv ) = Fv \u2297 Jv + K v \u2297 Fv ,\n(3.17)\nwith the remaining actions coinciding precisely with the case of definition 1.\nMoreover, relations (3.14) and (3.15) can be manipulated to those of definition 1. We\ndemonstrate that\nKv Ev\n\n(3.6)\n\n=\nKv K v Kv Ev\n(3.5),(3.16)\n=\nKv Ev K v Kv\n(3.14)\n=\nq 2 Ev Kv .\n\nThe other relations can be verified in a similar way. Although the co-product is different\nto that of definition 1, there exists a weak antipode which is the same as (3.13) in the\ncase of definition 1.\n6\n\n\fThis indicates that much of the discussion in [12] relating to vslq (2) is redundant.\nHowever, we would like to make it clear that we consider the paper [12] rich in ideas and\nan inspiration to our current investigations.\nThere are other possibilities for defining weak extensions of Uq [sl2 ]. These involve\nmixtures of definition 1 and definition 2 over the generators E, F . For example, we can\nsay that one case is where E satisfies the relations (3.8), (3.9) and F satisfies (3.15), along\nwith all the other relations common to both definition 1 and definition 2. The co-product\nwould then have the action\n\u2206(E) = 1 \u2297 E + E \u2297 K,\n\u2206(F ) = F \u2297 J + K \u2297 F,\nalong with the usual group-like co-product for K and K. The weak antipode would still\nbe the same as in definitions 1 and 2.\nWe can also swap this mixture of definitions and say that E satisfies those relations of\ndefinition 2, but F satisfies the relations of definition 1. This case is actually isomorphic\nto the first mixture, as we shall see later. In the section on Weak Uq [sln ] we give a more\nformal way of notating such mixtures.\nSo we now have some clues as to how we may approach the problem of defining weak\nextensions of Uq [sln ]. It is clear that there will be many possible combinations of generators\nsatisfying either of the two definitions in the general case. This then begs the question:\nhow would we know which mixtures of the two definitions lead to isomorphic algebras?\nTo this end we have an important observation regarding some of the automorphisms of\nthe original quantum algebra Uq [sln ] which \"lift up\" to isomorphisms between weak Hopf\nstructures. We shall look at these isomorphisms in more detail in the next section.\nIn general, we say that a generator satisfying the relations of definition 1 is of type 1,\nand is type 2 if it satisfies the relations of definition 2.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nWeak Uq [sln]\nMixing definitions\n\nFor the case of wslq (n), which has simple generators Ei , Fi , Ki and K i (i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1),\nwe can choose either definition 1 or 2 to describe the relations between any Ei and the\nKj /K j and similarly for any Fi . This is what is meant by the word \"mixture\". The\nrelations satisfied by the generators are as follows, for all i, j unless specified otherwise;\nKi Kj = Kj Ki , K i K j = K j K i , Ki K j = K j Ki , Ki K i = J,\n7\n\n\fJKj = Kj J = Kj , JK j = K j J = K j ,\nKi \u2212 K i\nEi Fj \u2212 Fj Ei = \u03b4ij\n,\nq \u2212 q \u22121\nEi2 Ei\u00b11 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )Ei Ei\u00b11 Ei + Ei\u00b11 Ei2 = 0,\nFi2 Fi\u00b11 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )Fi Fi\u00b11 Fi + Fi\u00b11 Fi2 = 0,\nEi Ej = Ej Ei , Fi Fj = Fj Fi , |i \u2212 j| \u2265 2. (4.1)\nWe also need to specify the relations between the Ei and the Kj for example. Let aij\ndenote the Cartan matrix for sl(n), aii = 2, ai,i\u00b11 = \u22121 and zero otherwise. If Ei satisfies\nKj Ei = q aij Ei Kj , Ei K j = q aij K j Ei , \u2200j,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwe say Ei satisfies definition 1, or simply Ei is type 1. However, if Ei satisfies\nKj Ei K j = q aij Ei , \u2200j,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwe say Ei satisfies definition 2, or simply Ei is type 2. The same convention holds for\nFi by replacing Ei with Fi and aij with \u2212aij in the above relation. Notice also that J is\ndefined for all i, so for example\nJ = Ki K i = Kj K j , i 6= j.\nThe co-product has the following action;\n\u2206(Ki ) = Ki \u2297 Ki ,\n\u2206(K i ) = K i \u2297 K i ,\n\u001a\n1 \u2297 Ei + Ei \u2297 Ki ,\n\u2206(Ei ) =\nJ \u2297 Ei + Ei \u2297 Ki ,\n\u001a\nFi \u2297 1 + K i \u2297 Fi ,\n\u2206(Fi ) =\nFi \u2297 J + K i \u2297 Fi ,\n\nEi is type 1\nEi is type 2\nFi is type 1\nFi is type 2\n\nwhile the action of the co-unit is\n\u03b5(1) = \u03b5(Ki ) = \u03b5(K i ) = 1, \u03b5(Ei ) = \u03b5(Fi ) = 0.\nThe weak antipode T will always have the form\nT (1) = 1,\nT (Ki ) = K i ,\nT (K i ) = Ki ,\nT (Ei ) = \u2212Ei K i ,\nT (Fi ) = \u2212Ki Fi ,\n8\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fregardless of the type of the generators Ei and Fi .\nIn order to notate these mixtures for wslq (n) we use a binary notation, where a 1\nindicates the use of a type 1 generator and a 0 indicates the use of a type 2 generator.\nWe list the 2(n \u2212 1) simple generators Ei and Fi , starting with the Ei followed by the\nFi . We then write down a list of 0's and 1's in the order corresponding to the generators\ndetermined by their type. This then gives an integer from 0 to 22(n\u22121) \u2212 1 in binary representation which contains all the information as to which particular mixture of definition\nwe are using for the relations between the generators Ei and Fi and all the Kj /K j . We\ndenote this integer d and the algebra is expressed as wsldq (n). In total there are 22(n\u22121)\npossible mixtures for wsldq (n).\nNote that we cannot have different definitions for the relations between the same\ngenerator with different Ki 's because the co-product could not possibly be consistent\nwith those defining relations.\nFor example, in the case of wslq (4) we have the simple generators (not including the\nKi ), E1 , E2 , E3 , F1 , F2 , F3 . Hence there are 26 = 64 different possibilities for relations\nwith the Ki . The notation wsl43\nq (4) has the following meaning. Since the number 43 has\nthe binary representation 101011, this is interpreted to mean that the simple generators\nE1 , E3 , F2 , F3 are type 1 with the remaining ones E2 , F1 being type 2. This information\nis determined by superimposing the list of binary digits {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1} with the list of\nsimple generators in the order {E1 , E2 , E3 , F1 , F2 , F3 }.\nIt should also be noted that the algebra wsl3q (2) coincides with wslq (2) given in [12]\n(and in section 3 above) and the example vslq (2) of [12] is precisely wsl0q (2) in our notation.\n\n4.2\n\nIsomorphic structures\n\nNow we look in more detail at the weak Hopf algebras of type Uq [sln ] using mixtures\nof the two types of generators. In some cases where d1 6= d2 , there exists a weak Hopf\nalgebra isomorphism wsldq 1 (n) \u2243 wsldq 2 (n). It is therefore worth investigating all possible\nisomorphisms in order to classify the weak extensions based on our criteria. As we shall\nsee in this section, the isomorphisms are derived from a subset of the set of automorphisms\non the algebra Uq [sln ]. In other words, a subset of the automorphisms on Uq [sln ] \"lift up\"\nto isomorphisms between the weak Hopf extensions. The reason only a subset can be\nconsidered, as we shall see later, is because some of the automorphisms of Uq [sln ] lose\ntheir invertibility when upgraded to act on the weak wsldq (n), so therefore cannot be\nisomorphisms.\nIf (A, \u2206, \u03b5, T ) and (B, \u2206\u2032 , \u03b5\u2032 , T \u2032 ) are weak Hopf algebras, then a weak Hopf algebra\n\n9\n\n\fisomorphism \u03c8 : A \u2192 B is an invertible algebra homomorphism satisfying\n(\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8) \u25e6 \u2206 = \u2206\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8,\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u03b5 = \u03b5\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8,\n\n(4.6)\n\n\u03c8 \u25e6 T = T \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8.\n\n(4.7)\n\nFor example, consider the algebra wsl1q (2). This has generators E (1) , F (1) , K (1) , K\n\n(1)\n\n(and 1(1) ) satisfying\nK (1) K\nK (1) K\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n= K\n\n(1)\n\nK (1) \u2261 J (1) ,\n\nK (1) = K (1) , K\n\n(1)\n\nK (1) K\n\nK (1) F (1) = q \u22122 F (1) K (1) , K\nK (1) E (1) K\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n=K\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\nF (1) = q 2 F (1) K\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\n= q 2 E (1) ,\n\nE (1) F (1) \u2212 F (1) E (1) =\n\nK (1) \u2212 K\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\nsince the binary representation of 1 = {0, 1} is superimposed with the list of generators\n{E (1) , F (1) } and so E (1) is type 2 and F (1) is type 1. Let us now consider the co-algebra\nstructure of this algebra. The co-product \u2206 and co-unit \u03b5 are respectively given by\n\u2206(K (1) ) = K (1) \u2297 K (1) ,\n\u2206(K\n\n(1)\n\n) = K\n\n(1)\n\n\u2297K\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\n\u2206(E (1) ) = J (1) \u2297 E (1) + E (1) \u2297 K (1) ,\n\u2206(F (1) ) = F (1) \u2297 1(1) + K\n\n(1)\n\n\u2297 F (1) ,\n\n\u03b5(E (1) ) = \u03b5(F (1) ) = 0,\n\u03b5(K (1) ) = \u03b5(K\n\n(1)\n\n) = 1.\n\nNow consider the map \u03c8 : wsl1q (2) \u2192 wsl2q (2) defined by the action\n\u03c8(E (1) ) = F (2) ,\n\u03c8(F (1) ) = E (2) ,\n\u03c8(K (1) ) = K\n\u03c8(K\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n,\n\n) = K (2) ,\n\nwhere we have employed an obvious notation with superscripts. This map derives from\nthe so-called Cartan involution on Uq [sl2 ]. In the weak case it can be seen to be a weak\nHopf algebra isomorphism since it preserves the generator type (that is, it is consistent\nwith the defining relations) and is also consistent with equations (4.5)-(4.7).\n10\n\n\fIn general the rule is that such an isomorphism must map a type 1 generator into a\ntype 1 generator and similarly for type 2. We demonstrate the sort of calculation required\nto show consistency with the relations. Take for example\nl.h.s. = \u03c8(K (1) )\u03c8(E (1) )\u03c8(K\n\n(1)\n\n) = K\n\n(2)\n\n= q2K\n\nF (2) K (2)\n\n(2)\n\n(K (2) F (2) K\n\n(2)\n\n)K (2)\n\n= q 2 F (2)\n= q 2 \u03c8(E (1) ) = r.h.s.\nThe other relations can be realised in a similar fashion. To demonstrate consistency with\nthe co-product, we can use equation (4.5) to determine \u2206\u2032 in this case. For example,\napplying both sides of (4.5) to E (1) gives\n(\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8)\u2206(E (1) ) = (\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8)(J (1) \u2297 E (1) + E (1) \u2297 K (1) )\n= J (2) \u2297 F (2) + F (2) \u2297 K\n\n(2)\n\n,\n\n\u2206\u2032 (\u03c8(E (1) )) = \u2206\u2032 (F (2) ).\nThis then gives the action of \u2206\u2032 on F (2) . The remaining actions are\n\u2206\u2032 (E (2) ) = E (2) \u2297 1(2) + K (2) \u2297 E (2) ,\n\u2206\u2032 (K (2) ) = K (2) \u2297 K (2) ,\n\u2206\u2032 (K\n\n(2)\n\n) = K\n\n(2)\n\n\u2297K\n\n(2)\n\n.\n\nNote that this is not the co-product given in equations (4.4), but it is in fact the opposite\nco-product, \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u25e6 \u2206 (\u03c3 being the flip operator), which we know from the theory of\nbialgebras is a perfectly acceptable one. It is also straightforward to verify (4.6) holds.\nBecause the action of the weak antipode is dependent on the co-product, T \u2032 will be\ndifferent to the one presented earlier. It is straightforward to verify that it does indeed\nexist, and that equation (4.7) is satisfied.\nAlthough there are undoubtedly many other possibilities to extend Uq [sl2 ] to a weak\nstructure, the extensions presented in this paper based on that of [12] total three, namely,\nwsl0q (2), wsl1q (2) \u2243 wsl2q (2) and wsl3q (2). In each case the weak antipode has the same\naction, that of (3.13).\n\n4.3\n\nNumber of unique structures\n\nWe now address the question of the number of possible weak Hopf algebra isomorphisms\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8 : wsldq (n) \u2192 wsldq (n), d 6= d\u2032 .\n11\n\n\fIt is well known that for Uq [sln ] there are several types of automorphisms [16]. The\nmost relevant to this paper are the Dynkin diagram automorphisms and the Cartan involution, since they give rise to Hopf algebra automorphisms and anti-automorphisms\nrespectively. We consider maps \u03c1d and \u03c9d which have the same actions as the Dynkin diagram automorphism and the Cartan involution respectively, but applied to the weak Hopf\nalgebra wsldq (n). These maps then become isomorphisms between weak Hopf structures.\nTheir actions are given by\n(d)\n\n(d\u2032 )\n\n(d)\n\n(d\u2032 )\n\n(d)\n\n(d\u2032 )\n\n(d)\n\n(d\u2032 )\n\n\u03c1d (Ei ) = En\u2212i , \u03c1d (Fi ) = Fn\u2212i , \u03c1d (Ki ) = Kn\u2212i , \u03c1d (K i ) = K n\u2212i ,\n(d\u2032\u2032 )\n(d)\n(d\u2032\u2032 )\n(d)\n(d\u2032\u2032 )\n(d)\n(d\u2032\u2032 )\n(d)\n\u03c9d (Ei ) = Fi , \u03c9d (Fi ) = Ei , \u03c9d (Ki ) = K i , \u03c9d (K i ) = Ki ,\nwhere the indices d (corresponding to the source), d\u2032 and d\u2032\u2032 (corresponding to the targets)\nare used to differentiate between the structures. Note that \u03c1d and \u03c9d map into different\nspaces which justifies the use of the different indices d\u2032 and d\u2032\u2032 . With these actions, it can\nbe easily verified that\n\u03c1d\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c1d = id, \u03c9d\u2032\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c9d = id.\nLusztig [17] has also given a set of algebra automorphisms defined on the quantised\nenveloping algebras. However, when applied to our weak generalisations, they are found\nto be non-invertible and therefore are not isomorphisms between weak Hopf algebras.\nAlthough we know of the existence of other algebra isomorphisms which exist between\nstructures, the only known weak Hopf algebra isomorphisms are \u03c1d and \u03c9d . We will\ncomment more on these algebra isomorphisms in section 5.\nOne important point is that \u03c1d and \u03c9d both preserve the generator type, so for example\n(d\u2032 )\n(d\u2032\u2032 )\n(d)\nif Ei is a type 1 generator, so are En\u2212i and Fi . Therefore \u03c1d and \u03c9d must correspond\nto maps (say rd and wd respectively) defined on the non-negative integers such that\n\u03c1d : wsldq (n) \u2192 wslrqd (d) (n),\n\u03c9d : wsldq (n) \u2192 wslqwd (d) (n).\nOnce we know the action of the maps rd and wd , this should allow us to be able to\ndetermine which structures are isomorphic and hence lead to a classification.\nTo this end, we write d in terms of its binary expansion\nd = (d0 , d1, . . . , dn\u22122 |dn\u22121, . . . , d2n\u22123 ),\nwhere the bar separates the values representing the Ei and Fi , and where the di have\nvalues of either 0 or 1. Then rd (d) and wd (d) have the expansions\nwd (d) = (dn\u22121, . . . , d2n\u22123 |d0 , . . . , dn\u22122),\nrd (d) = (dn\u22122, . . . , d0 |d2n\u22123 , . . . , dn\u22121).\n12\n\n\fIn terms of the components of the binary expansion we have\nwd (dk ) = d\u20323n\u22124\u2212k mod 2(n\u22121) ,\nrd (dk ) = d\u2032\u2032n\u22121+k mod 2(n\u22121) .\nThis simplifies the problem of determining isomorphic structures and allows us to explicitly count the number of unique structures for each n.\nIt is worth noting that \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u25e6 \u03c1, so the only isomorphisms we need to consider\nare \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c9 (we have dropped the subscripts for convenience). According to this\nprescription, there can only be at most four structures which are isomorphic. In some\ncases there could be two and in others there could be no isomorphisms. These cases\nare referred to below as degenerate. The situation can be summarised in the following\ndiagram\nr(d)\n\nd\n\n//\n\n|==\n||\n|\n||\n||\nBB\nBB\nBB\nBB\n!!\n\nw(d)\n//\n\nw \u25e6 r(d)\n\nr \u25e6 w(d)\n\nwhere in some cases the arrows could be equalities, in which case there would be one of the\nafore mentioned degeneracies. In order to count the number of unique (non-isomorphic)\nweak extensions of wsldq (n), we list all the possible degenerate cases;\n(1)\n\nw(d) = d,\n\n(2)\n\nr(d) = d,\n\n(3)\n\nr(d) = w(d),\n\nand consider their intersection (1) \u2229 (2) \u2229 (3), union (1) \u222a (2) \u222a (3) and their union's\ncomplement (1) \u222a (2) \u222a (3) in order to count the total number of unique cases. We note\nthat some of these cases will lead to exactly two isomorphic structures, and combinations\nof the above cases will lead to no isomorphic structures. We aim to separate each of these\nsituations and then add the number of structures relating to each.\nCase (1): The only d satisfying w(d) = d is of the form\nd = (d0 , d1 , . . . , dn\u22122|d0 , d1 , . . . , dn\u22122).\nTherefore the total number of cases satisfying case (1) is 2n\u22121 .\nCase (2): We separate this case into two cases corresponding to n being odd and even.\nFor n = 2m + 1 the only d satisfying case (2) is of the form\nd = (d0 , d1 , . . . , dm\u22121 , dm\u22121 , . . . , d0|d2m , d2m+1 , . . . , d3m\u22121 , d3m\u22121 , . . . , d2m ),\n13\n\n\fso there are 22m = 2n\u22121 possibilities. For n = 2m the only d satisfying case (2) has the\nform\nd = (d0 , . . . , dm\u22122 , dm\u22121 , dm\u22122 , . . . , d0 |d2m\u22121 , . . . , d3m\u22123 , d3m\u22122 , d3m\u22123 , . . . , d2m\u22121 ),\nso there are 22(m\u22121)+2 = 22m = 2n possibilities.\nCase (3): The only d satisfying this case is of the form\nd = (d0 , d1 , . . . , dn\u22122|dn\u22122 , . . . , d0),\nso there are 2n\u22121 possibilities.\n(1) \u2229 (2) \u2229 (3): Once again we treat the case for n is even and odd separately. For\nn = 2m + 1, d is of the form\nd = (d0 , d1 , . . . , dm\u22121 , dm\u22121 , . . . , d0|d0 , d1 , . . . , dm\u22121 , dm\u22121 , . . . , d0 ),\nso there are 2m = 2(n\u22121)/2 possibilities. For n = 2m, d is of the form\nd = (d0 , . . . , dm\u22122 , dm\u22121 , dm\u22122 , . . . , d0|d0 , . . . , dm\u22122 , dm\u22121 , dm\u22122 , . . . , d0 ),\ngiving 2m = 2n/2 possibilities.\n(1) \u222a (2) \u222a (3): Combining the above three cases and subtracting twice their intersection\ngives the union, for which there are 3.22m \u2212 2m+1 possibilities for n = 2m + 1 and 22m+1 \u2212\n2m+1 possibilities for n = 2m. The compliment of the union then has 24m \u2212 3.22m + 2m+1\npossibilities for n = 2m + 1 and 24m\u22122 \u2212 22m+1 + 2m+1 possibilities for n = 2m.\nTo calculate the exact number of unique structures we consider the fact that case\n(1) without cases (2) or (3) (and permutations) will have precisly 2 structures which\nare isomorphic, or put another way, isomorphic structures in these cases come in pairs.\nTherefore we need to half the number obtained above when counting the total number of\nstructures. Similarly for the structures which do not fall into these degenerate cases. There\nwill be exactly 4 isomorphic structures so we need to divide the number corresponding to\n(1) \u222a (2) \u222a (3) by 4.\nTherefore the number of non-isomorphic structures, say Zn , is\n22m \u2212 2m 22m \u2212 2m 22m \u2212 2m\n24m \u2212 3.22m + 2m+1\n+\n+\n+ 2m +\n2\n2\n2\n4\n3\n= 24m\u22122 + .22m ,\n4\n24m\u22122 \u2212 22m+1 + 2m+1\n22m\u22121 \u2212 2m 22m \u2212 2m 22m\u22121 \u2212 2m\n+\n+\n+ 2m +\n=\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4m\u22124\n2m\u22121\n= 2\n+2\n.\n\nZ2m+1 =\n\nZ2m\n\n14\n\n\fPutting these two cases together gives\nZn = 2n\u22124 (7 + (\u22121)n + 2n ),\nwhich is the number of unique weak Hopf structures corresponding to wsldq (n).\nThis formula for Zn has been verified up to n = 10 by directly applying the maps \u03c1,\n\u03c9 and \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c9 and then counting the number of unique structures. To give the reader an\nidea of the number of structures, we have the table below.\nn\nZn\n\n2\n3\n\n3 4 5\n7 24 76\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n288 1072 4224 16576 66048\n\nWe also list for n \u2264 4 all the values of d, putting isomorphic values in brackets {, }.\nFor n = 2 we have already determined that the values\nd = 0, {1, 2}, 3\ngive the 3 unique structures. For n = 3 the values of d for the 7 structures are\nd = 0, {1, 2, 4, 8}, {3, 12}, {5, 10}, {6, 9}, {7, 11, 13, 14}, 15.\nFor n = 4 the 24 values of d are\nd = 0, {1, 4, 8, 32}, {2, 16}, {3, 6, 24, 48}, {5, 40}, {7, 56}, {9, 36}, {10, 17, 20, 34},\n{11, 25, 38, 52}, {12, 33}, {13, 37, 41, 44}, {14, 28, 35, 49}, {15, 39, 57, 60}, 18,\n{19, 22, 26, 50}, {21, 42}, {23, 58}, {27, 54}, {29, 43, 46, 53}, {30, 51},\n{31, 55, 59, 62}, 45, {47, 61}, 63.\nAll cases up to n = 10 have been calculated, but are obviously too unwieldy to include in\nthe article.\n\n5\n\nDirect sum decomposition and Sweedler's example\n\nWe now look in more detail at the algebraic structure and show that the upgraded quantised enveloping algebra automorphisms are not the only algebra isomorphisms between\nthe various wsldq (n).\nFirst recall Sweedler's example [14] of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, denoted H. H\nis generated by elements I, G, X (where I is the identity element) satisfying the relations\nG2 = I,\nGX = \u2212XG,\nX 2 = 0.\n15\n\n\fThe co-product is given by\n\u2206(G) = G \u2297 G,\n\u2206(X) = X \u2297 G + I \u2297 X,\nand the co-unit given by\n\u03b5(G) = 1 = \u03b5(I),\n\n\u03b5(X) = 0.\n\nThe antipode S is given by the action\nS(G) = G, S(I) = I, S(X) = GX.\nClearly H is 4 dimensional with basis {I, G, GX, X}.\nIn order to give an example of a weak Hopf algebra based on this structure with\ngenerators {1, g, x} (we now use lower case symbols), instead of using the relation g 2 = 1,\nwe impose the relation g 3 = g. Moreover, we can choose either the relation gx = \u2212xg,\nin which case we refer to x as a type 1 generator (analagous to the notion discussed at\nthe end of section 3), or we can choose the relation gxg = \u2212x, in which case we call x a\ntype 2 generator. A type 2 generator is also a type 1 generator, but not conversely, since\ng 2 6= 1.\nFor the first case, we choose x to be type 1. Denote the algebra by H1 . The following\nrelations are satisfied.\ng 3 = g,\ngx = \u2212xg,\nx2 = 0,\nalong with the same co-product and co-unit as in the usual Hopf case (given above).\nSolving equations (2.1) and (2.2) gives the weak antipode\nT (1) = 1,\nT (g) = g,\nT (x) = gx,\nwhich has the same action as the antipode from the Hopf case but nevertheless is not an\nantipode. The defining relations imply that H1 is 6 dimensional with basis\n{1, g, g 2, x, gx, g 2x}.\nNote that the element g 2 is a central idempotent. This is easily verified with the defining\nrelations.\n16\n\n\fIt is with this example that we demonstrate explicitly how to obtain a direct sum\ndecomposition for an algebra with a central idempotent. This procedure will then be\nextended to the case of wsldq (n).\nH1 has a direct sum decomposition\nH1 = H10 \u2295 H11 ,\nwhere H10 is the subalgebra with basis {(1 \u2212 g 2 )x, 1 \u2212 g 2 }, on which multiplication by g 2\nis zero (indicated in the superscript), and H11 is the subalgebra with basis {g, g 2, gx, g 2x}\non which multiplication by g 2 is the identity (also indicated in the superscript). In fact,\nthese two subalgebras are determined by setting\nH10 = (1 \u2212 g 2 )H1 ,\nH11 = g 2H1 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the map \u03c8 : H11 \u2192 H with the action\n\u03c8(g) = G,\n\u03c8(g 2 ) = I,\n\u03c8(gx) = GX,\n\u03c8(g 2x) = X,\ndefines a weak Hopf algebra isomorphism, where I, G, X are the generators of the original\nSweedler Hopf algebra H. Since H appears as a subalgebra of H1 , we can simply apply\n\u03c8 \u22121 \u2297 \u03c8 \u22121 to the R-matrix of H (see [15]) to obtain an R-matrix R of H1 satisfying\nR\u2206(a) = \u03c3 \u25e6 \u2206(a)R, \u2200a \u2208 H1\nR13 R23 = (\u2206 \u2297 id)(R),\nR13 R12 = (id \u2297 \u2206)(R).\nSuch an R-matrix is then given by\nR = g 2 \u2297 g 2 \u2212 2p \u2297 p + \u03b1(g 2x \u2297 g 2 x \u2212 2g 2 x \u2297 px + 2px \u2297 px),\nwhere p = (g 2 \u2212 g)/2 and \u03b1 is an arbitrary parameter. This R is not invertible, but it\nsatisfies the regularity condition [12]\nRR\u0302R = R,\n\n(5.2)\n\nR\u0302RR\u0302 = R\u0302,\n\n(5.3)\n\n17\n\n\fwhere\nR\u0302 = g 2 \u2297 g 2 \u2212 2p \u2297 p + \u03b1(g 2x \u2297 g 2 x \u2212 2px \u2297 g 2 x + 2px \u2297 px).\nIt should also be noted that the Sweedler Hopf algebra H also appears as a subalgebra\nof H1 with its generators defined by\nI = 1,\nG = 1 + g \u2212 g2,\nX = (1 + \u03b1g)gx,\nwhere \u03b1 is an an arbitrary constant. However, this is just an observation and has no\nconsequence to the results of our paper, since this subalgebra is only isomorphic to H as\nan algebra, not a bialgebra.\nNow we look at the algebra H2 , which corresponds to the choice of the generator x to\nbe of type 2. This implies the following relations;\ng 3 = g,\ngxg = \u2212x,\nx2 = 0.\nThe only difference with the co-product in this case is with the action defined on the\ngenerator x, which is now given by\n\u2206(x) = x \u2297 g + g 2 \u2297 x,\nand the co-unit is the same as usual.\n2\n\nThe algebra H2 is 5 dimensional with basis\n\n2\n\n{1, g, x, gx, g }. Note that g is a central idempotent. Defining\nH20 = (1 \u2212 g 2 )H2 ,\nH21 = g 2H2 ,\nthe decomposition\nH2 = H20 \u2295 H21\nstill holds, where the superscripts still refer to the action of g 2 , but now H20 has basis\n{1 \u2212 g 2 } and H21 has basis {g 2 , g, x, gx}.\nOnce again it is possible to verify that there exists a weak Hopf algebra isomorphism\n\u03c6 : H21 \u2192 H with the following action;\n\u03c6(g 2 ) = I,\n\u03c6(g) = G,\n\u03c6(x) = X,\n\u03c6(gx) = GX.\n18\n\n\fIn a similar way to both of the examples above, for a quantised enveloping algebra\nU \u2261 Uq [sln ], its weak extension Uw and some other algebraic structure U0 , a decomposition\nof the form\nUw = U0 \u2295 U = (1 \u2212 J)Uw \u2295 JUw .\nexists due to there being a central idempotent J whose existence derives from the relaxation of the invertibility of group-like elements in the algebra. In fact it is straightforward\nto prove the fact that for any d,\nUq [sln ] \u2243 J.wsldq (n).\nThis result is another way of stating Proposition 1 from the paper [12].\nFrom another point of view, we could say that a weak extension is nothing but the\noriginal Hopf algebra plus some other algebra in which is contained all the information\nregarding the weak structure. In this case, it would help to know what conditions U0\nwould have to satisfy in order that Uw has a weak Hopf structure. This has not been\nthe approach of this paper as we saw in the last section. Since there are no other weak\nHopf algebra isomorphisms on the weak wsldq (n), the classification as weak Hopf algebras\nis complete. However, if we were to consider all possible algebra isomorphisms, this\ndirect sum decomposition is important since it leads to discovering several \"unexpected\"\nisomorphisms which do not arise from the action of the automorphisms in the quantised\nenveloping algebra case.\nSince we only need the presence of a central idempotent to achieve this direct sum\ndecomposition, we can apply this idea to the weak extensions of Uq [sln ] from the previous section, since the element J is always a central idempotent. However, it does not\naffect our classification of the weak Hopf algebra structure from the previous section.\nTo demonstrate, we show that, rather unexpectedly, there is an algebra isomorphism\n9\n\u03c8 : wsl10\nq (3) \u2192 wslq (3).\n9\nWe first apply the direct sum decomposition to U = wsl10\nq (3) and V = wslq (3) such\nthat\nU = (1 \u2212 J)U \u2295 JU \u2261 U0 \u2295 U1\nand similarly\nV = (1 \u2212 J \u2032 )V \u2295 J \u2032 V \u2261 V0 \u2295 V1\nExplicitly we have U0 generated by < (1 \u2212 J)E1 , (1 \u2212 J)F1 , 1 \u2212 J > and U1 generated\nby < J, JE1 , JF1 , E2 , F2 , K1 , K2 , K 1 , K 2 >. For V , denoting its generators by a prime,\nwe have V0 generated by < (1 \u2212 J \u2032 )E1\u2032 , (1 \u2212 J \u2032 )F2\u2032 , 1 \u2212 J \u2032 > and V1 generated by <\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nJ \u2032 , J \u2032 E1\u2032 , E2\u2032 , F1\u2032 , J \u2032 F2\u2032 , K1\u2032 , K2\u2032 , K 1 , K 2 >. It is straightforward to show that both U1 and\n19\n\n\fV1 are isomorphic as (weak) Hopf algebras to Uq [sl(3)]. It is also easy to verify that U0\nand V0 are both Abelian with the same number of generators and are therefore isomorphic\nas algebras. Combining these two facts leads to the isomorphism \u03c8 : U \u2192 V , the action\nof which is given by\n\u03c8(1) = 1,\n\u03c8(E1 ) = (1 \u2212 J \u2032 )F2\u2032 + F1\u2032 ,\n\u03c8(E2 ) = J \u2032 F2\u2032 ,\n\u03c8(F1 ) = E1\u2032 ,\n\u03c8(F2 ) = E2\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8(Ki ) = K i ,\n\u03c8(K i ) = Ki\u2032 .\nThe map \u03c8 is consistent with all the defining relations so is therefore an algebra homomorphism and it can be shown to have inverse\n\u03c8 \u22121 (E1\u2032 ) = F1 ,\n\u03c8 \u22121 (E2\u2032 ) = F2 ,\n\u03c8 \u22121 (F1\u2032 ) = JE1 ,\n\u03c8 \u22121 (F2\u2032 ) = (1 \u2212 J)E1 + E2 ,\n\u03c8 \u22121 (Ki\u2032 ) = K i ,\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8 \u22121 (K i ) = Ki .\nTherefore \u03c8 is an isomorphism.\nIf we set the action of the co-product \u2206 for U and allow the freedom to choose the\nco-product \u2206\u2032 of V consistently with \u03c8, then we end up having to compare the action of\n(\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8) \u25e6 \u2206 with \u2206\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8. Applying both of these maps to the generators will clearly give a\nnon-coassociative \u2206\u2032 . Therefore the \u03c8 only can be considered as an algebra isomorphism.\nHowever, it is uncertain whether or not this co-product \u2206\u2032 would define a quasi-bialgebra\n[2]. This certainly raises some interesting questions relating to whether or not these\nisomorphisms could correspond to some kind of Drinfeld twist. If so, then perhaps our\nclassification is only a much smaller classification of the structures as quasi-bialgebras.\nThis idea may warrant further investigation.\n\n20\n\n\f6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have seen that it is possible to define weak extensions of Uq [sln ] by only relaxing some\nof the relations in the original algebra. As we saw in the work of Li and Duplij [12], one\nnice way of doing this is to relax invertibility of the group-like elements to a more general\nregularity condition and also to impose one of two relations on the other generators. This\nallows us to define many examples.\nOne observation is that it is also possible to extend the definition of a quantised\nsuperalgebra [18] to the weak case by using the same idea of relaxing the invertibility\nof the generators K and K. We demonstrate with the algebra wospdq (2|1) which has\ngenerators {K, K, V+ , V\u2212 }. We define the parity of these generators to be p(K) = p(K) =\n0, p(V\u00b1 ) = 1.\nThe following relations are satisfied;\nKK = KK,\n\nKKK = K,\n\nKV\u00b1 = q \u00b11 V\u00b1 K,\n1K\u2212K\n{V+ , V\u2212 } = \u2212\n.\n4 q \u2212 q \u22121\n\nKKK = K,\n\nKV\u00b1 = q \u22131 V\u00b1 K,\n\n(6.1)\n\nKeeping in theme with the previous sections, if in addition the following relations are\nsatisfied,\nKXK = q \u00b11 X\nwhere X = V+ or V\u2212 , then we call X a type 2 generator. Otherwise we call X a type 1\ngenerator. This example is almost exactly like the case of wsldq (2) in that we have the same\nnotion of generators of type 1 and 2. The co-algebra structure is of the same form, and\nthe only real difference is that the weak antipode is a graded algebra anti-homomorphism,\nso it satisfies T (ab) = (\u22121)p(a)p(b) T (b)T (a).\nAll the weak Hopf algebras given in this paper have non-cocommutative co-products.\nThis implies existence of universal R-matrices that could give new solutions of quantum\nYang-Baxter equations as mentioned in [10, 12]. One direction for future work is to\ninvestigate the form of such R-matrices. We expect the expressions would not be that\ndifferent to those of the original Hopf algebra due to the direct sum decomposition of\nsection 5. In fact, in section 5 we gave one possible R-matrix for the finite dimensional\nweak Hopf generalisation of Sweedler's well known example using these facts.\nSection 5 also demonstrates the fact that there are many algebra isomorphisms between structures. In this article we did not investigate all possible isomorphisms, but\ninstead gave a small existence proof that such isomorphisms do indeed exist. It would be\ninteresting to classify these structures as algebras using this observation.\n21\n\n\fA question that arose during our investigation is one related to automorphisms and\ntwisting, especially in the usual quantised enveloping algebra case. As we have already\nmentioned, the algebra automorphisms are well known for the quantised enveloping algebras, some of which are also bialgebra automorphisms. We are currently unaware of\nwhether or not, corresponding to every algebra automorphism \u03c8 : A \u2192 A, there exists a\ntwist element F \u2208 A \u2297 A such that\n(\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8)\u2206(a) = F.\u2206(\u03c8(a)).F \u22121 , \u2200a \u2208 A.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.
