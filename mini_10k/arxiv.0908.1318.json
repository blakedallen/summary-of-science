While looking at history of studies along this\nline, one can point out two important milestones: (i) discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), honeycomb-lattice\ncylinders, dating back to 1991,1 and (ii) fabrication of\nindividual atomic planes, called graphene (Gr), by exfoliation from graphite in 2004.2 So far, on obvious grounds,\nthe CNTs have been much more thoroughly investigated\nthan Gr, but this difference diminishes very quickly.\nThis paper focusses on spin transport problems, mostly\non giant magnetoresistance, related to potential applications of graphitic nanostructures in spintronics. In\nthis respect, quite a lot has been done in the case of\nCNTs, there are hundreds of both experimental3,4,5,6,7\nand theoretical8,9,10,11 papers, covering all the transport\nregimes (ballistic, Coulomb blockade, Schottky barrier\nand Kondo) which show that the GMR or TMR (T for\ntunnel) effects are usually quite considerable. The respective studies on Gr are still scarce. The pioneering experimental paper on magnetoresistance is Ref[12], where\nGr spin valve devices with permalloy contacts have been\nshown to have the GMR effect \u2243 10% at room temperature. The following experimental paper,13 reports\non conductance of Gr showing Fabry-Perot-like patterns,\nand pronounced oscillations of GMR (including changes\nin sign). From the theoretical point of view, the debate\nis still on, and the question whether or not the Gr-based\nspin valves have a good performance is still open. The\nresults published so far show that the answer to this question depends critically on the contacts (cf. Ref.[14] and\nRefs.[15,16]). In this study, in contrast to those reported\n\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\nhitherto by other theoreticians, a 3-dimensional contacts\nare used.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II the theoretical method based on a tight-binding model, as well\nas the way the graphene sheets and the contacts have\nbeen modelled, are shortly outlined. Sec. III is devoted\nto presentation of results, whereas the subsequent section\nsummarizes the main results.\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD AND MODELLING\n\nThe method employed here is similar to that used earlier while dealing with carbon nanotubes inserted between ferromagnetic contacts,9,10,11 except that carbon\nallotrope of interest now is graphene . The single \u03c0orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian describes a graphene\nsheet of width W and length L (in the current direction). The semi-infinite metallic electrodes extend from\n< \u2212\u221e, 0 > and < L, \u221e > for the source and drain, respectively. The ferromagnetic electrodes are supposed to\nhave spin-split s-bands, mimicking d-bands of real transition metals. The total Hamiltonian reads\n\nH=\u2212\n\nX\ni,j,\u03c3\n\nti,j |i, \u03c3i h\u03c3, j| +\n\nX\ni,\u03c3\n\n\u01ebi,\u03c3 |i, \u03c3i h\u03c3, i| ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i and j run over the whole device (i.e graphene\nand the electrodes), \u03c3 is the spin index, and ti,j and \u01ebi,\u03c3\nstand for the hopping integrals and the on-site potentials,\nrespectively. The systems under study are impurity-free\nwith well transparent interfaces (strong coupling limit) so\nneglecting of correlations in the Hamiltonian should be\n\n\f2\nfunctions in k-space.\np\n(E \u2212 \u01eb\u03c3 (k))2 \u2212 4|w(k)|2\ng\u03c3 (k, E) =\n2|w(k)|2\n\u221a\n3ky a\nkx a\ncos\n) + \u2206\u03c3\n\u01eb\u03c3 (k) = 2t(cos kx a + 2 cos\n2\n2\nik a\nkx a ik\u221ay a\n\u2212 \u221ay\n3 ),\nw(k) = \u2212t(2 cos(\n(2)\n)e 2 3 + e\n2\n\u221a\nwhere a = 2aGr is the fcc-metal lattice constant, g\u03c3 is\nthe surface Green function for spin \u03c3, and \u2206\u03c3 is a rigid\nband splitting chosen so as to give a desirable spin polarization P of the electrodes. Here P=50% has been\nset, corresponding to \u2206\u2191 = \u22122.32 t and \u2206\u2193 = 1.6 t\n(in the paramagnetic case \u2206\u03c3 = \u22120.86 t). Incidentally, this simple parametrization has already been shown\nto work satisfactorily well in the case of carbon nanotube/ferromagnet systems.9,10 \u01eb\u03c3 (k) in Eq. (2) is the\nfcc(111)-surface energy spectrum, calculated for a semiinfinite metal slab according to the method described in\nRef. [19]. The surface k-vectors lie on the metal surface\nbut upon attachment of graphene they are no longer good\nquantum numbers, so the trick is to perform a Fourier\ntransformation to the real space and work with those\nsurface Green function which are close to the graphene\ninterface. After having transformed the surface Green\nfunction to the real-space, the self-energies \u03a3\u03b1\n\u03c3 and the\ncorresponding spectral functions \u0393\u03c3\u03b1 are computed from\n\u03a3\u03c3\u03b1 = T g\u03c3\u03b1 T \u2020 and \u0393\u03c3\u03b1 = i(\u03a3\u03c3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a3\u03c3\u03b1 \u2020 ), respectively. With\n\u03b1 =L or R, referring the left and right electrodes, and\nT being the Gr/electrode coupling matrices. Henceforth,\nthe spin indexes \u03c3 will be skipped for brevity.\nE \u2212 \u01eb\u03c3 (k) \u00b1\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Graphene sheets attached to semiinfinite 3-dimensional metallic electrodes. The left and right\nparts correspond to the zigzag- and armchair-edge ribbons,\nrespectively. The lower part shows details of the interfaces,\nwhereas the letters A, B denote a type of the sublattice the\ninterface carbon atoms belong to.\n\nThe recursive method goes as follows20\n\njustified if one restricts oneself just to the ballistic transport regime, putting aside the Coulomb blockade6,17 and\nKondo5,7 regimes. In this regard, the on-site parameters\nin the present approach are used to take into account the\neffect of the gate voltage in the graphene sheet as well as\nthe spin band-splitting in the metallic electrodes.\nFig. 1 shows schematically devices of the present interest, viz. zigzag-edge graphene (zz-Gr) and armchair-edge\ngraphene (ac-Gr). The graphene sheets (black spheres)\nare sandwiched between metallic contacts (light spheres).\nThe diameters of the spheres correspond to the nearest\nneighbor spacings. The unit cells in the vertical direction\nare the blunt saw-teeth lines for zz-Gr, and double zigzag\nlines for ac-Gr. As readily seen, it is assumed that there\nis a perfect lattice matching between graphene and the\nelectrodes. In fact this assumption is acceptable since the\ngraphene lattice constant (aGr = 2.46\u00c5) fits really well\nto interatomic distances in such metals like: Cu (2.51 \u00c5),\nNi (2.49 \u00c5) or Co (2.55 \u00c5).18\nThe use of a single-orbital electrodes allows to write\nan analytic expression for the electrodes surface Green\n\ngL (0)\ngL,R (i)\n\u03a3L (i)\n\u03a3R (i)\n\n\u2261\n=\n=\n=\n\ngL , gR (N + 1) \u2261 gR ,\n(E \u2212 Di \u2212 \u03a3L,R (i))\u22121\nTi,i\u22121 gL (i \u2212 1)Ti\u22121,i ,\nTi,i+1 gR (i + 1)Ti+1,i ,\n\nGi = (E \u2212 Di \u2212 \u03a3L (i) \u2212 \u03a3R (i))\u22121 .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nAbove, gL,R are local Green's functions for the i-th unit\ncell of graphene, the matrices D and T stand for the diagonal and off\u2013diagonal Hamiltonian sub-matrices, whereas\nthe full Green's function is given by Eq. 4. The graphene\nunit cells extends from i=1 (following the L electrode)\nup to i=N (preceding the R electrode). So the recursion\nstarts with the metal-interface Green functions gL (0) and\ngR (N +1) being Fourier components of the surface Green\nfunctions defined in Eq.(2).\nThe other quantities of interest are transmission (T ),\nconductivity (\u03c3 ) , and shot noise Fano factor (F), as\nwell as giant magnetoresistance (GMR).

At first, for comparison, we have calculated\nGMR for zz- and ac-Gr sheets vs. energy which, in principle, is proportional to the gate voltage. From the results\nin Fig.2 one can see that GMR, at least in the ac-Gr case,\nis quasi-periodic with the period-length roughly proportional to the aspect ratio A, i.e inverse proportional to the\nlength of the graphene sheets L. Numerically, the periods\nare close to the well-established value p \u223c\n= 2eV /L[nm],21\nor in the present units p \u223c\n0.8\nA/W[nm]\n(the energy unit\n=\nis t=2.7 eV). Incidentally, some features characteristic for\nFabry-Perot resonances in graphene have been already\nreported21,22 , where it has been also stressed that irregularities and defects of graphene-edges may turn the con-\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Shot noise Fano factor for the armchair\ngraphene ca 8nm in width and with the aspect ratio A=0.36:\nfor ferromagnetic electrodes (parallel alignment - thin solid\nline, and antiparallel alignment - dash line). Inset presents\nthe respective conductivities.\n\nventional Fabry-Perot picture into a spectacular quantum billiard-type one. It is seen in Fig. 2 that the GMR\nfactors for ac-Gr and zz-Gr differ in 3 respects: (i) magnitude, (ii) the maxima of the former are roughly equidistant in contrast to the latter, moreover (iii) in the former\nthe onset of the second sub-band is visible (at E \u223c\n= 0.08,\nexcept for A=3.4, where W > L), whereas in the latter it\nalways is washed out. Qualitatively these results, showing that GMR vs. energy (gate voltage) changes also in\nsign, are consistent with the experiment of Ref. [13].\nAnother interesting point encountered here, is the universal behavior issue due to evanescent modes at the\nDirac points. It is well-known that graphene sheets of\nlarge sizes, with W \u2212\u2192 \u221e and L \u2212\u2192 \u221e (with W > L),\nif homogenous, reveal universal values of \u03c3 = 4/\u03c0 e2 /h\nand F = 1/3.21,25,26 . The term \"homogenous\" in this\ncontext means that the device at hand is an all-carbon\nsystem, typically, with a central graphene sheet, and\nhighly doped graphene electrodes. This theoretical concept might be quite realistic for widely applied experimental setups with side-contacted grahene sheets, provided evaporated metal contacts are not invasive, i.e.\nthey do not destroy the underlaying honey-comb lattice but merely dope it slightly. It has been also shown\ntheoretically that in the case of end-contacted devices\nto 2-dimensional square-lattice contacts, the situation is\nmore complicated and respective values of the conductivity and the Fano factor do depend on the on-site potentials in electrodes and on details of bonds between\nsquare-lattice electrodes and graphene.27 Importance of\n\n\f4\n\n0.6\n\ne /h]\n\n2\n\n0.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nE/t\n\n0.2\npara\n0.1\n\nP\nAP\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nE/t\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Shot noise Fano factor for the zigzagedge graphene ca 8nm in width and with the aspect ratio\nA=3.4: for paramagnetic electrodes (thick solid line), ferromagnetic electrodes (parallel alignment - thin solid line, and\nantiparallel alignment - dash line).

In the\npresent theory this condition is fulfilled provided the hopping parameter across the interface (tc ) is not too different from the geometric mean of hopping parameters for\nthe metal\nelectrodes (tM ) and graphene (t), i.e. from\n\u221a\ntc = tM t. Otherwise, in case of a drastic differentiation\nof the hopping parameters, and opaque interfaces (very\nsmall tc ) the Coulomb blockade physics may come into\nplay,17 out of reach of the present approach.\n\n1.4\n\n0.4\n\nFig.3 clearly shows that this scenario also holds in the\nferromagnetic case for ac-Gr if the aspect ratio is not\ntoo big (Gr ribbon is long enough). Indeed maxima in\n\u03c3 (Inset) correspond to minima of F (at F=0) in the\nmain panel. In the zz-Gr case with the same A value the\nsituation is similar (not plotted), but then the oscillations\nin the P and AP configurations are not phase-shifted.\nAs regards Gr sheets with bigger A, Figs.4 and 5 show\nsome features of F and \u03c3 which happen to be similar\nto the universal ones when the Gr sheets are paramagnetically contacted (thick black lines). However, if the\ncontacts are ferromagnetic there is a tendency for F to increase and for \u03c3 \u2013 to decrease. This suggests that in general Gr-flakes studied here show non-universal behavior,\nwhich is to be attributed to the finite sizes, and the inhomogeneity resulting in contact-dependent charge transfer between interface atoms (and accompanying electronhole asymmetry). Incidentally, the present approach\nwas shown earlier to yield short-range charge transfer,\naffecting mainly interface carbon monolayers.10,20 As a\nmatter of fact, the non-universal behavior of F and \u03c3\nin Gr-systems has been already reported to be due to:\ncharged impurity scattering,34 strong disorder35 , invasive\ncontacts.36,37\n\nzz-Gr, A=3.4\n\n0.5\n\nF\n\nthe interface conditions which determine, inter alia, mixing of propagating modes, and whether or not the momentum component along the interface direction is conserved, has been noticed in Ref.[27,28,29,30,31,32]. It\nhas been also demonstrated using one-parameter scaling\narguments that at the Dirac points, conductivity of an\ninfinitely large graphene with disorder is infinite (zero)\nif there is not (there is) intervalley scattering.23 Beyond\nthe Dirac points the evanescent modes give way to the\npropagating ones, and in the ballistic transport regime,\nperfect noiseless transmission due to Fabry-Perot resonances may take place.13,24\n\n0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nE/t\n\n0.3\n\npara\n\n0.2\n\nP\nAP\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nE/t\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) As 4 but for armchair-edge graphene.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSummarizing, the aim of this study has been to estimate the effect of the chirality as well as the aspect ratio\non the GMR coefficient of graphene flakes end-contacted\nto ferromagnetic electrodes. In contrast to other theoretical approaches, the leads are not supposed here to be\n\ntwo-dimensional (of honeycomb- or square-lattice type),\nbut more realistically they are modelled as 3-dimensional\nfcc-(111) semi-infinite slabs. It turns out that for long\nand narrow systems (small aspect ratio), the GMR is\na quasi-periodic function of energy (gate voltage) with\nthe period roughly proportional to the aspect ratio, re-\n\n\f5\nflecting Fabry-Perot-like resonances, typical of ballistic\ntransport. Notably, the GMR coefficient of the ac-Gr\nflakes may exceed 20% - 40%, depending on the aspect\nratio value, whereas for zz-Gr flakes the corresponding\nfigures are distinctly smaller, but still significant. The\ndifference is due to the fact that in the case of armchairedge sheets all the interface carbon atoms belong to the\nsame sub-lattice (say, A-type), as opposed to the zigzag\nones with interface carbon atoms of both A- and B-type.\nThis inevitably facilitates intervalley mode mixing in the\nlatter case. Another noteworthy point, in the context\nof zero-energy (Dirac-point) conductivity and Fano factor, is that for the big aspect ratio. Such systems studied here show non-universal behavior when ferromagnetic\nelectrodes are applied. It is so even if the corresponding\nvalues for the paramagnetic electrodes happen to be close\nto the universal ones (4/\u03c0 e2 /h and 1/3 for \u03c3 and F, respectively). However, these systems are inhomogeneous\nand rather small, so neither the limits W \u2212\u2192 \u221e and\nL \u2212\u2192 \u221e (with W > L), nor the requirement of a large\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nS.
