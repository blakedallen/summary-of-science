Despite their regular\ninclusion in review articles (Thorne 1987; Flanagan 1998)\nthey have received little in the way of detailed modelling. In\nthis paper we will combine many of the physical processes\nrelevant to the problem of free precession and assess their\nrelative importance. The motivation behind this work is to\naid gravitational wave data analysis (Schutz 1991). Given\nthe huge computational requirements of this analysis, any\nadditional information supplied by theoretical modelling of\na source greatly increases the chances of detection. With the\nTAMA detector already operational, the GEO600 and LIGO\ndetectors due to go on-line within a year, and the VIRGO\ndetector following soon after, this issue is particularly pressing.\nThe study of gravitational wave generation from freely\nprecessing neutron stars can be divided into two parts. The\nfirst problem is the formulation of a free precession model\nconsistent with our current understanding of neutron star\nstructure. Neutron stars are not rigid bodies-they consist\nof a thin elastic shell containing a superfluid core. A model\ntaking these features into account was described in detail\nin Jones & Andersson (2001), where the effect of free prec 0000 RAS\n\ncession on electromagnetic pulsar signals was described and\ncompared with pulsar observations. (A handful of potential\nfree precession candidates were identified, but, as we will\nsee, they all rotate too slowly to be of gravitational wave\ninterest). A brief summary of this model is set out in this\npaper. A key feature is the decay of free precession due to\ndissipative processes internal to the star.\nThe second part of the problem is to look at particular\nscenarios in which free precession is created and/or maintained by an astrophysical mechanism. The torques due to\naccretion disks, neutron star magnetic dipole moments, and\nother gravitating bodies will be considered, as well as perturbations associated with glitches. We wish to investigate\nwhether these mechanisms are capable of balancing the internal dissipation to give steady long-lived precessional motions. Having done so, we will then be in a position to estimate possible gravitational wave amplitudes in these various\nscenarios.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we\nbriefly describe our free precession model, and parameterise\nthe timescale in which internal dissipation damps the wobble\nmotion. In section 3 we show how the finite breaking strain\nof the crust can be used to place an upper bound on the\ngravitational wave field of a precessing star, regardless of\nits environment. We also suggest a detection strategy for\ngravitational wave data analysts. General formulae relating\n\n\f2\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\nthe gravitational wave amplitude to the strength and nature\nof a pumping torque are given in section 4. The possible\ngravitational wave field strengths in various scenarios are\nthen estimated in sections 5\u20138. Our conclusions are given in\nsection 9, together with some suggestions for further work.\n\n2\n\nT\u22a5J\n\n\u271b\n\n\u274f\n\u276a\n\u274f\n\nDynamics of free precession\n\nIn this section we will briefly summarise our model of neutron star free precession. For more detail see Jones & Andersson (2001). We will begin by describing the free precession\nof a rigid body, as the motion in the more realistic elastic\nshell/fluid core case can be thought of as a modification of\nthis.\nThe moment of inertia tensor of any axisymmetric rigid\nbody can be written as\nI = I0 \u03b4 + \u2206Id (nd nd \u2212 \u03b4/3),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the Kronecker delta, and the unit vector nd points\nalong the body's symmetry axis. Then the principal moments are I1 = I2 = I0 \u2212 \u2206Id /3, I3 = I0 + 2\u2206Id /3, so that\nI3 \u2212 I1 = \u2206Id . When \u2206Id > 0 the body is said to be oblate,\nand when negative the body is prolate. As we will describe\nbelow, the oblate case is the more physically plausible.\nThe angular momentum is related to the angular velocity according to\nJ = (I0 \u2212 \u2206Id /3)\u03a9 \u2212 \u2206Id \u03a93 nd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the 3-axis lies along nd . This shows that the three\nvectors J, \u03a9 and nd are always coplanar. Following Pines\n& Shaham (1972a,b) we will call the plane so defined the\nreference plane (see figure 1). Given that the angular momentum is fixed, this plane must revolve around J. The free\nprecession is conveniently parameterised by the angle \u03b8 between nd and J. We will refer to this as the wobble angle.\nFor a nearly spherical body the angle \u03b8\u0302 between \u03a9 and J is\nmuch smaller than the angle between J and nd , according\nto\n\u2206Id\n\u03b8\u0302 \u2248\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8.\n(3)\nI1\nWe will denote by nJ the unit vector along J. Decomposing\nthe angular velocity according to\n\u03a9 = \u03c6\u0307nJ + \u03c8\u0307nd\n\n(4)\n\nthen gives\nJ = I1 \u03c6\u0307,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2206Id\n\u03c8\u0307 = \u2212\n\u03c6\u0307.\nI3\n\n(6)\n\nThe symmetry axis nd performs a rotation about J in a\ncone of half-angle \u03b8 at the angular frequency \u03c6\u0307. We will\nrefer to this as the inertial precession frequency. There is\na superimposed rotation about the symmetry axis nd at\nthe angular velocity \u03c8\u0307 . This is usually referred to as the\nbody frame precessional frequency, with the corresponding\nperiodicity known as the free precession period :\nPfp =\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n\u03c8\u0307\n\n\u273b\n\nnd\n\nA MODEL OF NEUTRON STAR FREE\nPRECESSION\n\n2.1\n\nJ\n\n(7)\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\n\u03b8\u0302\n\n\u274f \u03b8 \u2704\n\u274f \u2704\n\u274f\u2704\n\n\u2704\n\n\u2704\n\u2704\n\n\u2704\n\n\u2704\n\n\u2704\n\u2704\n\n\u2704\u2717\u2704\n\nFigure 1. This figure shows the reference plane for a freely precessing body, which contains the deformation axis nd , the angular\nvelocity vector \u03a9 and the fixed angular momentum J. The vectors\nnd and \u03a9 rotate around J at the inertial precession frequency \u03c6\u0307.\nWe refer to \u03b8 as the wobble angle. The vector T\u22a5J is the part of\nan applied torque that causes a secular evolution in the wobble\nangle.\n\nFor a nearly spherical body equation (6) shows that \u03c8\u0307 \u226a \u03c6\u0307.\nNote that the angles (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8) are simply the usual Euler\nangles which describe the orientation of the rigid body (see\ne.g. Landau & Lifshitz 1976, figure 47).\nTurning now to the more realistic case of an elastic crust\nwith a liquid core, the moment of inertia of the crustal shell\ncan be written as (Alpar & Pines 1985):\nI = I0 \u03b4 + \u2206I\u03a9 (n\u03a9 n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03b4/3) + \u2206Id (nd nd \u2212 \u03b4/3).\n\n(8)\n\nThe first term on the right hand side is the moment of inertia\nof the non-rotating undeformed spherical shell. The second\nterm is the change due to centrifugal forces, and has n\u03a9 , the\nunit vector along \u03a9, as its symmetry axis. The third term is\nthe change due to some other source of deformation, (such\nas strains in the crustal lattice), and has the unit vector nd ,\nfixed in the crust, as its symmetry axis. Without this third\npart the above equation would simply represent a fluid ball,\nand free precession would not be possible.\nThe free precession of such an elastic shell containing\na liquid core is then very similar to the rigid result, with\nthe geometry described in figure 1 still applying, providing\nthe \u2206Id in equations (3) and (6) is now set equal to the\ndeformation in the inertia of the whole star, i.e. crust and\ncore, while I0 is still equal to the crustal moment of inertia\nonly. Explicitly:\n\u2206Id\n\u03b8,\n(9)\nIcrust\n\u2206Id\n\u03c8\u0307 = \u2212\n\u03c6\u0307.\n(10)\nIcrust\nNote that centrifugal deformation \u2206I\u03a9 is not of importance\nwhen considering the free precession geometry.\nOne further component can be added to our model: A\npinned superfluid coexisting with the inner crust. As was\n\n\u03b8\u0302 =\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nfirst described by Shaham (1977), the effect of such a component is to increase the body frame free precession frequency\n\u03c8\u0307. In the case where the rotation rates of the superfluid and\ncrust are the same, equations (9) and (10) still apply, with\n\u2206Id now containing a part equal to the moment of inertia\nof the pinned superfluid. However, as described in Jones &\nAndersson (2001), the handful of free precession candidates\nidentified in the pulsar population don't seem to have such a\ncomponent. Therefore, on those few occasions in this paper\nwhere we assume a particular source of deformation, we will\nassume that \u2206Id is caused entirely by Coulomb forces in\nthe crustal lattice. (If real stars do have a significant pinned\nsuperfluid component, then the increased body frame precession frequency will lead to an even faster dissipation of\nthe free precession energy, and tend to re-enforce our final\nconclusion).\nThe effect of a torque on the free precession can be\neasily summarised. Given that the torque-free motion is determined completely by the two numbers (\u03c6\u0307, \u03b8), we need\nonly describe the effect of the torque on these.

However, in practice the most significant source of deformation in a neutron star is likely to\nbe strains in its solid crust. As described in Baym & Pines\n(1971) and Pines & Shaham (1972a,b), if the crust has a\nzero strain oblateness \u01eb0 , the actual deformation produced\nis of order\n\u01ebd =\n\nenergy of the star. The constant B also depends on the equation of state, and will be of order of the total electrostatic\nbinding energy of the ionic crustal lattice. We will define\nb = B/(A + B) as the rigidity parameter. It is equal to zero\nfor a fluid star (B = 0) and unity for a perfectly rigid one\n(B/A \u2192 \u221e). Realistic neutron star equations of state imply\nthat b takes a value of:\n3\nb \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 R65 /M1.4\n.\n\nB\n\u01eb0 .\nA+B\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the constant A depends on the stellar equation of\nstate, and will be of the order of the gravitational binding\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(15)\n\n(See Jones (2000) for a simple derivation, and Ushomirsky,\nCutler & Bildsten (2000) for a detailed numerical treatment). The smallness of this number reflects the fact that\ngravitational forces dominate crustal Coulomb forces in determining the equilibrium shape of the star. In this sense,\nneutron star crusts are very far from perfectly rigid. Note\nthat b \u223c 10\u22125 for a canonical 1.4M\u2299 , 10 km neutron star.\nMore rigid stars can exist only if less massive (and therefore larger radii) neutron stars occur in nature, or if current\nequations of state seriously underestimate the crust thickness. We will therefore present results for rigidity parameters\nover the interval 10\u22123 \u2192 10\u22125 , but will bear in mind that\nvalues at the smaller end of the interval are more plausible.\nFor a very young star the zero-strain oblateness \u01eb0 will\nbe determined simply by the star's shape at the moment\nwhen its crust first solidified, i.e. \u01eb0 = \u01eb\u03a9 (f = fsolid ),\nwhere fsolid is the spin frequency at the moment of solidification. For older stars, \u01eb0 will have changed due to\nplastic deformation in the crust, either because of a gradual creep or a more violent shape change, possibly connected with a glitch. Certainly, it seems likely that real stars\nwill be oblate (\u01eb0 > 0 \u21d2 \u2206Id > 0) rather than prolate\n(\u01eb0 < 0 \u21d2 \u2206Id < 0).\n2.3\n\nThe centrifugal deformation described above can be conveniently parameterised by the dimensionless quantity \u01eb\u03a9\nwhich we will define by 3\u01eb\u03a9 /2 = \u2206I\u03a9 /Istar (this follows the\nnotation of Alpar & Pines 1985). This will be of the order\nof the rotational kinetic energy of the star divided by its\ngravitational binding energy:\n\n3\n\nWobble damping\n\nA real neutron star, once set into free precession, will not\nprecess forever-energy will be dissipated within the star,\nconverting the kinetic energy of the wobble into thermal energy. Also, gravitational wave energy and angular momentum will be radiated to infinity, which must be subtracted\noff the star's motion.\nThe problem of gravitational radiation reaction was examined in detail by Cutler & Jones (2000), who showed that\nthe main result was to cause the wobble angle to decay exponentially on a timescale:\n\u03c4\u03b8 = 1.8 \u00d7 109 yr\n\n\u0012\n\nIcrust\n1044 g cm2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1038 g cm2\n\u2206Id\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n100Hz\nf\n\n\u00134\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nregardless of whether the deformation is oblate or prolate.\nThis is almost certainly much longer than the timescales\nconnected with internal dissipation. In particular, models\nof neutron star interiors, motivated in part by the need to\nmodel glitches, predict a frictional type coupling between\nthe crust and core. The result of this coupling is a torque T\nexerted on the crust:\nT = K(\u03a9fluid \u2212 \u03a9solid ),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere K is a positive constant. Such a torque would tend\n\n\f4\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\nto restore corotation between crust and core in a glitching\nneutron star. However, as modelled by Bondi & Gold (1955),\nthe torque would also tend to damp the wobble angle of\na precessing body. The timescale for this damping can be\nparameterised by n, the number of free precession periods\nPfp in which one e-fold occurs:\n\u03c4d =\n\nI0\nnP.\n\u2206Id\n\n(18)\n\nwhere P is the spin frequency (approximately 2\u03c0/\u03c8\u0307) of the\nbody. The parameter n has been estimated by Alpar & Sauls\n(1988) who examined the scattering of electrons off the superfluid vortices. This interaction is sometimes referred to\nas 'mutual friction'. Alpar & Sauls estimated n to lie in the\ninterval 400 \u2192 104 , giving a wobble damping timescale of:\n\u03c4d = 3.2 yr\n\n\u0010\n\nn\n104\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nI0\n1044 g cm2\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1038 g cm2\nId\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nComparing equations (16) and (19) it is clear that internal\ndissipation is likely to damp the free precession much more\nrapidly that gravitational radiation reaction.\nInterestingly, in the case of prolate deformations, the\ninternal dissipation acts so as to increase the wobble angle.\nHowever, as described in section 2.2, prolate deformations\nare probably not likely to be found in real stars, and so for\nthe remainder of this paper we will assume that deformations are oblate, corresponding to a damping of the wobble\nmotion.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTHE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE FIELD\nGeneral form of the field\n\nThe gravitational wave field for a rigid precessing body was\nfirst calculated by Zimmerman & Szedenits Jr (1979), using the mass quadrupole formalism (see e.g. Misner, Thorne\nand Wheeler 1973). As described in the previous section,\neven though the elasticity and fluid core are important in\ndetermining the free precession period, the geometry of free\nprecession in the realistic case is very similar to that in\nthe rigid case-the deformation bulge moves in a cone of\nhalf-angle \u03b8 at a rate \u03c6\u0307. (The superimposed rotation at \u03c8\u0307\nabout the axis nd does not change the mass quadrupole of\nthe body, and so does not appear in the gravitational wave\nphysics). It follows that, to the accuracy of our model at\nleast, the wave field calculated by Zimmerman & Szedenits\nJr (1979) applies in the realistic case. Explicitly, the gravitational waves are emitted at frequencies \u03c6\u0307 and 2\u03c6\u0307 and with\nthe two polarisations (denoted by + and \u00d7):\nh+ (\u03c6\u0307) =\n\n2\u03c6\u03072\nsin i cos i\u2206Id sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 cos(\u03c6\u0307t)\nr\n\n(20)\n\nh\u00d7 (\u03c6\u0307) =\n\n2\u03c6\u03072\nsin i\u2206Id sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 sin(\u03c6\u0307t)\nr\n\n(21)\n\nh+ (2\u03c6\u0307) =\n\n2\u03c6\u03072\n(1 + cos2 i)\u2206Id sin2 \u03b8 cos(2\u03c6\u0307t)\nr\n\n(22)\n\nh\u00d7 (2\u03c6\u0307) =\n\n2\u03c6\u03072\n2 cos i\u2206Id sin2 \u03b8 sin(2\u03c6\u0307t)\nr\n\n(23)\n\nfor a source at distance r and angular momentum at inclination angle i to the line of sight. Note that the \u2206Id factor is\nthe part of the quadrupole moment tensor due to the deformation process, not the centrifugal piece. The modifications\nto this result due to the non-rigidity are small, and lie beyond the accuracy of our free precession model.\n3.2\n\nLimit on gravitational wave amplitudes due to\nfinite crust strength\n\nAs described in Jones & Andersson (2001), a real neutron\nstar crust will have a finite breaking strain ubreak . This can\nbe used to place an upper bound on the wobble angle of\na precessing star. We know that (for small wobble angles\nat least) when an initially axially symmetric body is set\ninto free precession, a deformation \u2206Id remains along the\naxis nd fixed in the star, while a deformation \u2206I\u03a9 points\nalong the angular velocity vector. From the point of view\nof an observer attached to the crust, a deformation of size\n\u2206I\u03a9 describes a cone of half-angle \u03b8 + \u03b8\u0302 \u2248 \u03b8 about nd .\nThis change in shape is all we need to know to estimate\nthe strain: The change in position of any given particle is of\norder R\u01eb\u03a9 \u03b8, while the corresponding strain is of order \u01eb\u03a9 \u03b8.\nThis precession-induced strain is not constant, but varies\nwith magnitude \u01eb\u03a9 \u03b8 over one (body frame) free precession\nperiod. As there exists a maximum strain ubreak that the\nsolid can withstand prior to fracture, the wobble angle will\nbe limited to a value of ubreak /\u01eb\u03a9 so that:\n\u03b8max \u2248 0.45\n\n\u0012\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u00132 \u0010\n\nubreak\n10\u22123\n\n\u0011\n\nradians.\n\n(24)\n\nQualitatively, we can say that faster spinning neutron stars\nhave larger bulges to re-orientate and therefore can sustain smaller wobble angles prior to fracture. For sufficiently\nslowly spinning stars the above equation breaks down, yielding angles in excess of \u03c0/2. The wobble angles of such slowly\nspinning stars are not limited by crustal strain.\nThe value of ubreak is highly uncertain. By extrapolating the breaking strains of terrestrial materials, Ruderman\n(1992) suggests the value relevant for neutron star crusts\nmay lie in the range 10\u22122 to 10\u22124 .\nThis limit on the wobble angle \u03b8 can be used to place\nan upper bound on the gravitational wave amplitude of a\nfreely precessing star with a given deformation \u2206Id . To do\nso we will characterise the field strength by\nG \u03c6\u03072\n\u2206Id \u03b8.\n(25)\nc4 r\nThis is an order-of-magnitude approximation to the set of\nequations (20)\u2013(23). The trigonometric factor describing the\nvariation of wave amplitude with inclination angle i has been\nneglected entirely, while the trigonometric factor in the precession angle \u03b8 has been replaced by its small angle limit.\nNote that in this small-angle limit the radiation is emitted\nmainly at the frequency \u03c6\u0307-the radiation at frequency 2\u03c6\u0307 is\na factor \u03b8 smaller.\nThe purpose of this approximation is to enable us to\ngain a insight as to how gravitational wave amplitudes depend upon source parameters such as the breaking strain,\nfrequency and deformation size. This analysis is a useful\npreparation for sections 5\u20138 where detailed astrophysical situations are considered.\nh=\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\n\n5\n\nWe will specialise to the case where the deformation\n\u2206Id is due to Coulomb forces in the crustal lattice. We set\n\u2206Id = 3Istar \u01ebd /2 with \u01ebd given by equation (14). For definiteness, we will assume the crust is 'relaxed', i.e. the zerostrain oblateness \u01eb0 is equal to the centrifugal oblateness \u01eb\u03a9 .\n(These two quantities can differ by the small crustal breaking strain anyway-see Jones & Andersson 2001).

In (26) \u03b8 has been left a free parameter. However, to obtain an upper bound on h we can\nset \u03b8 to its maximum value as obtained from crust cracking\nconsiderations, i.e. put \u03b8 = \u03b8max . We then obtain\nh(\u03b8 = \u03b8max ) = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221228\nfor f < f\u03b8 and\nh(\u03b8 = \u03b8max ) = 1.8\u00d710\u221228\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\n\u00114 \u0010\n\n\u00112 \u0010\n\nb\n10\u22125\n\nb\n10\u22125\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n(27)\n\nubreak\n(28)\n10\u22123\n\n\u0011\n\nFigure 2.

The noisecurves have been taken from Owen & Sathyaprakash (1999).\nNote that a knee appears in many of the signal curves. This\nknee corresponds to f = f\u03b8 . Above this frequency the wobble angle is limited according to (24). We have assumed the\nmatched filtering can accumulate signal only for a time of\none year. The amplitudes are shown only for frequencies\nless than a kilohertz, as stars rotating more rapidly than\nthis have not yet been observed. Figure 2 plots h for the\nparameters ubreak = 10\u22123 , r = 1 kpc and for three different values of b: b = 10\u22125 , b = 10\u22124 , b = 10\u22123 . Recall\nthat b = 10\u22125 is the value expected for a canonical 1.4M\u2299\nR = 10 km neutron star, while b = 10\u22123 would correspond\nto a lighter larger star with a thicker crust. In figure 3 plots\nh for b = 10\u22125 and breaking strains of ubreak = 10\u22122 , 10\u22123\nand 10\u22124 .\nIn making the above assumptions regarding matched\nfiltering we have assumed that the wobble angle and spin\nfrequency of the star remain constant for the observation\nperiod of one year. In practice the wobble angle will decay\nsignificantly over this interval (see section 2.3) unless a sufficiently strong pumping mechanism is active. However, the\npurpose of these figures isn't to model in detail any particular scenario-they are included simply so that we might gain\ninsight into how wave amplitudes depend upon the rigidity and breaking strain parameters, and identify parameters\nvalues capable of leading to detectable signals. These figures\nsay nothing about the distance to the nearest source, or, in\nthe case of burst-like sources, the event rate. Issues such as\nthese can only be addressed in the case of particular pumping mechanisms. This will be carried out in sections 5\u20138,\nwhere the complicating effect of internal dissipation will be\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 3.

The noise curves are as\nindicated in figure 2.\n\nincluded also. In short, figures 2 and 3 represent absolute\nupper bounds on the wave amplitude for a given spin frequency, crustal breaking strain and deformation, but give\nno information about likely wave amplitudes in nature.\nWith these qualifications in mind, we will note that\n\u22123\nthese figures show that for neutron stars with b >\n\u223c 10 ,\nthe \u03b8 = \u03b8max gravitational wave signal is detectable by firstgeneration interferometers for frequencies in excess of 100\nHz. Slower spinning sources produce steady gravitational\nwave signals which are intrinsically too weak to be detected.\nStars with b \u2248 10\u22124 are potentially detectable by first generation interferometers only for frequencies close a 1 kHz.\nMore realistically, stars with b \u2248 10\u22125 are potentially detectable by an Advanced LIGO interferometer at frequencies\nover 100 Hz.\n\n\f6\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\n3.3\n\nDetection strategy\n\nThe problem of determining source parameters from electromagnetic observations of a freely precessing neutron star\nwas examined by Jones & Andersson (2001). The extraction of these parameters in the case of a gravitational wave\ndetection was examined by Zimmermann & Szedenits Jr.\n(1979), who showed that measurement of all four components of h given in equations (20)\u2013(23) allows extraction of\nthe inclination angle i, the wobble angle \u03b8 and the quantity\n\u2206Id /r.\nAs was also noted by Zimmermann & Szedenits Jr.\n(1979), if this is combined with an estimate of r a value for\n\u2206Id is obtained. This is of considerable use: If the deformation is of Coulomb origin the equation \u2206Id = 3Istar b\u01eb0 /2 can\nbe combined with equation-of-state calculations of the rigidity parameter b to give the reference oblateness \u01eb0 . A value\nof \u01eb0 very different from the fluid oblateness might then be a\nsign that the deformation \u2206Id is not due to crustal strains.\nNote however that if the wobble angle is very small the\nabove two equations can be solved only for i and the product\n\u2206Id \u03b8/r. This is likely to be the case for the fastest spinning\nstars whose wobble angles are limited by fracture according\nto equation (24).\nIf the source is observed as a pulsar it may be possible to\nobtain additional information. Suppose the electromagnetic\npulse originates from a dipole m inclined at an angle \u03c7 to\nthe deformation axis. Then the motion of m is due to the\ncombined rotation of nd about J at \u03c6\u0307 and the motion of m\nabout nd at \u03c8\u0307. As noted by Zimmermann & Szedenits Jr.\n(1979) the electromagnetic pulse frequency is then given by\nfem = \u03c6\u0307 + \u03c8\u0307 for \u03b8 < \u03c7, while for \u03b8 > \u03c7 we have fem = \u03c6\u0307.\nIn the case of Coulomb deformations of rapidly spinning\nstars we would expect the \u03b8 < \u03c7 regime to apply. Then the\ndifference between electromagnetic and gravitational wave\nfrequencies would give \u03c8\u0307, and to leading order equation (10)\ngives\n\u2206Id = Icrust \u03c8\u0307/fem .\n\n(30)\n\nIf in addition an estimate of the pulsar's distance were available the product (\u2206Id /Icrust )\u03b8/r could be decomposed into\nits component parts.\nThe above remarks concerning frequency splitting suggest the following strategy for gravitational wave observers.\nSuppose we are searching for a precessional gravitational\nwave signal from a star of known (average) electromagnetic\npulse frequency f . Then one matched filter should be used\nat that frequency to cover the \u03b8 > \u03c7 case where there is\nno splitting between the gravitational and electromagnetic\nsignals. However, if splitting does occur, it will be necessary\nto search at a rotational frequency \u2206f = f \u2206Id /Icrust above\nthis. For definiteness we will assume a Coulomb deformation\nto give\n\u2206f = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n\u0010\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\n\u00113 \u0010\n\nb\n10\u22125\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\nI/Icrust\n10\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nwhere equation (13) has been used.\nWe now wish to identify a frequency band in which\nto search for the gravitational signal. This is easily done.\nConsider some particular frequency, say 100 Hz. Then from\nfigure (2) we see that even for an Advanced LIGO, b values\nless than 10\u22125 give signals too weak to be detected. From the\n\nabove formula this value of b corresponds to \u2206f = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125\nHz. Therefore there is no point in searching for signals at\nfrequencies less than (100 + 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) Hz (apart from the\nsignal at f mentioned above). On the other hand, on physical\ngrounds the value b = 10\u22123 is surely an upper bound on\nthe rigidity parameter. This corresponds to \u2206f = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123\nHz. Therefore there is no point in searching for signals at\nfrequencies greater than (100 + 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 ) Hz. In this way\nwe identify a frequency band in which to fruitfully search\nfor the gravitational signal. A year-long integration would\nrequire matched filters with a 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 Hz spacing. In this\nexample this would require approximately 105 templates.\nThe above argument attempts to identify the gravitational waves at the inertial precession frequency \u03c6\u0307. There\nwill be radiation at 2\u03c6\u0307 also. This can be searched for using\ntemplates at twice the frequencies described above.\n\n4\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PUMPING\nMECHANISMS\n\nIt is useful to categorise pumping mechanisms according to\nthe sort of evolution they produce in the wobble angle. As\ndiscussed above, the effect of a torque depends upon its projection into the reference plane, which rotates around the\nstar's angular momentum vector at a rate \u03c6\u0307. This projection\nwill depend upon the details of the mechanism producing the\ntorque, possibly leading to a complicated evolution in the\nwobble angle. Nevertheless, we will find it useful to define\nthe four categories described below. We will define \u03c4pump\nas a timescale characterising the strength of the pumping\ntorque. Its exact meaning will depend upon the nature of\nthe mechanism.\nIt is also useful to derive the following expressions for\nthe wave amplitude written in terms of a timescale rather\nthan a frequency.

Again, these formulae will be of use in estimating\nwave amplitudes in later sections.\n\n4.1\n\nOscillatory pumping\n\nWe will first consider the case where the torque does not\nremain fixed relative to the reference plane, but instead rotates around it at some frequency. In sections 5 and 6 we\nwill identify such torques that rotate at the body frame precessional frequency with respect to the reference plane, i.e.\nwith a frequency \u03c8\u0307. Specialising to this case we see that for\nhalf a precession period the wobble angle will increase, but\nfor the next half-cycle it will decrease. We will refer to this\nas oscillatory pumping. It will produce a wobble angle that\nvaries as\n\u03b8 = \u03b8osc (1 + cos \u03c8\u0307t)\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03b8osc denotes the average value of \u03b8 attained. To orderof-magnitude accuracy this will be given by\n\u03b8osc \u223c\n\nPfp\n1\nIcrust\n\u223c\n\u03c4pump\n\u2206Id \u03c6\u0307\u03c4pump\n\n(39)\n\nwhere equation (10) has been used.

However, in the case of sufficiently small \u2206Id the precession angle as given by (39) will exceed \u03b8max . In such a\ncase equation (40) represents an upper bound.\n\n4.2\n\nIn subsequent sections we will find examples of torques\nwhich tend to increase the wobble angle at a rate proportional to the angle itself, i.e. produce exponential pumping.\nThen\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u03b8\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\n\u03c4pump\n\u03c4g,\u03b8\n\u03c4d\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nIn general, these timescales are all functions of frequency. In\nthe case where the frequency and therefore the timescales\nare not constant the solution will be complex. However, in\na constant frequency system such as an accreting star at\nspin equilibrium, the above equation leads to exponential\nsolutions. We will consider such a system.\nClearly, in order to calculate the wave amplitude due to\nsuch a mechanism we need to compare the three timescales\nthat appear in (41). In order to simplify this problem we will\ndivide it into two smaller ones. First we will include only the\npumping and gravitational radiation reaction. This will lead\nto an upper bound on h for stars free of internal dissipation.\nThen we will include the pumping and internal dissipation\nonly. This will lead to an upper bound on h for gravitational\nradiation reaction free stars. Real stars will be acted upon\nby both gravitational radiation reaction and internal dissipation. Therefore, at a given frequency, the upper bound on\nh for real stars will be less than the minimum of the two\nseparate bounds. In fact, we have already seen that in practice internal dissipation is more effective than gravitational\nradiation reaction in damping the wobble (section 2.3). We\nwill nevertheless include gravitational radiation reaction in\nthis section, partly to quantify just how much weaker it is\nthan internal damping, and partly to be able to give an upper bound on the gravitational wave amplitude that would\napply even if the estimates of internal damping strength of\nsection 2.3 are too large by many orders of magnitude.\nWe begin by neglecting the internal dissipation. From\nequation (41) we see that \u03b8 evolves exponentially, increasing\nwhen \u03c4g,\u03b8 > \u03c4pump and decreasing when the inequality is\nreversed. The wobble angle will then either increase to its\nmaximum value or decrease to zero:\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n\u03b8max\n\nfor\n\n\u03c4g,\u03b8 > \u03c4pump\n\n(42)\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n0\n\nfor\n\n\u03c4g,\u03b8 < \u03c4pump .\n\n(43)\n\nSubstitution of (42) into (32) then gives an estimate of\nthe wave amplitude:\nh=\n\n\u0014\n\n5G Icrust\n2c3 \u03c4g,\u03b8\n\n\u00151/2\n\n\u03b8max\n.\nr\n\n(44)\n\nThis is valid for \u03c4pump < \u03c4g,\u03b8 and so we obtain an upper\nbound on h if we set these two timescales equal:\nh(\u03c4pump = \u03c4g,\u03b8 ) =\n\n\u0014\n\n5G Icrust\n2c3 \u03c4pump\n\n\u00151/2\n\n\u03b8max\n.\nr\n\n(45)\n\nNow consider the case where the gravitational radiation\nis neglected. Then equations of the form of (42) and (43)\napply again, but with \u03c4g,\u03b8 replaced by \u03c4d .

Such a torque would lead to a linear\n\n\f8\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\nvariation in the wobble angle, i.e. linear pumping.

More precisely, the above equation represents an estimate of h for systems with \u03c4g,\u03b8 /\u03c4pump < \u03b8max\nbut an upper bound for systems where the inequality is reversed.\nThe analogous calculation for radiation reaction free\nsystems gives\n\u03c4d\n\u03b8=\n(51)\n\u03c4pump\nleading to the upper bound\nh(\u03c4pump = \u03c4d ) =\n\nn\n2\u03c0G Icrust\n.\n\u03c6\u0307\nc4\nr\n\u03c4pump\n\n(52)\n\nClearly the exponential and linear pumping mechanisms\nare very different. The exponential mechanism leads to precession only when the pumping torques overcome the radiation reaction and internal dissipation effects, i.e. either gives\nwobble angles limited by \u03b8max or gives no precession at all.\nOn the other hand the linear pumping mechanism will always give a finite precession angle, as indicated in equations\n(49) and (51). Also, exponential pumping mechanisms cannot lead to precession in systems which are originally not\nprecessing, while linear pumping mechanisms can. However,\nthe upper bounds on h obtained via the two types of pumping are similar. Comparing (45) with (50) and (47) with (52)\nwe see that the upper bounds differ only by a factor \u03b8max\nwhich is of order to unity for low frequencies.\n4.4\n\nImpulsive pumping\n\nWe will describe any process that acts to increase \u03b8 on\ntimescales much less than a precession period as an impulsive pumping mechanism. For an isolated star the angular\nmomentum during this interval will be constant (apart from\nany negligible amount carried away by a radiation field, unless the star ejects part of its mass!). It therefore follows\nthat the kinetic energy of the star must change. On the\nother hand, if the impulse is brought about via an interaction with another body it is possible for only the kinetic\nenergy to change, or only the angular momentum, or both.\nGlitches in young pulsars are of interest as candidates for\nisolated impulsive pumping (section 7), while near-body encounters in dense environments are of interest as candidates\nfor non-isolated impulsive pumping (section 8).\n\n5\n\nACCRETION TORQUES\n\nAccretion torques are an obvious place to start when looking\nfor mechanisms to pump precession. Not only are they capable of exciting wobble, but they can also maintain the spin\nfrequency of the system, leading to the possibility of longlived constant wave amplitude sources. Indeed, accretion has\nalready been investigated as a means of powering gravitational wave emission via CFS-type instabilities (Papaloizou\n& Pringle 1978; Wagoner 1984) and via quadrupole moment\nasymmetries connected with crustal composition variations\n(Bildsten 1998).\nThe torque on the central star is the sum of two parts.\nThe first is simply the material torque, i.e. due to the accretion of angular momentum from matter detaching from the\ndisk and falling onto the star. The second torque is due to\nthe coupling of the star's magnetic field with the disk. The\nnet effect of these torques is to spin-up slowly rotating stars\nbut impose a maximum spin frequency for fast stars where\nthe accretion torque vanishes. It is useful to construct an\norder-of-magnitude accretion spin-up timescale by considering the material torque at the magnetosphere radius:\n4\n\n\u03c4a,\u03c6\u0307 \u2248 1.34 \u00d7 10 yr\n\n#\n\"\n\u0010 f \u0011 \u0010 B \u0011 \u0012 \u1e40 \u00133 \u22122/7\n1 Hz\n\n109 G\n\n\u1e40E\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u1e40 and ME denote the actual and Eddington accretion\nrates (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983). Note, however, that this\nwill only be equal to the spin-up timescale for slowly rotating\nstars. The accretion torque will vanish when the corotation\nradius lies just outside the inner disk edge. This limits the\nspin frequency of fast stars:\nfmax \u2248 526 Hz\n\n\u0011\u22126/7 \u0012\n\n\u0010\n\nB\n109 G\n\n3\n\n\u0010\n\nf\n1 Hz\n\n\u0010\n\nf\n1 Hz\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u00133/7\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\nThis can be combined with equation (53) to give a lower\nbound on \u03c4a,\u03c6\u0307 for a given frequency and accretion rate:\n\u03c4a,\u03c6\u0307 \u2265 1.7 \u00d7 10 yr\n\n\u00114/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u00114/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(55)\n\nIf we assume that this torque has a significant component perpendicular to the star's angular momentum vector,\nthen the corresponding wobble pumping timescale must be\nIcrust /I times this (see equation 12):\n\u03c4a,\u03b8 \u2265 1.7 \u00d7 103 yr\n\n\u0013\n\nIcrust\n.\nI\n\n(56)\n\nWe will make use of this when estimating maximum wave\namplitudes below.\nAlmost all analyses of accretion torques have assumed\naxisymmetry, giving rise to either purely spin-up or spindown torques. However, precession pumping requires a\ntorque with a component orthogonal to the spin axis. It\nfollows that if we wish to find accretion torques capable of\npumping precession we need to identify situations in which\nthe torque itself would be non-constant. Fortunately, we\nwould expect this to be the case when magnetospheric effects are taken into account. As pointed out by Lamb et\nal. (1975), the accretion rate and therefore also the torque\ndepend upon the balance of gravitational, centrifugal and\nmagnetic forces. The torque is therefore a function of the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nplasma angular velocity, stellar angular velocity and stellar magnetic moment vectors. However, if the star is itself\nprecessing the relative orientation of these vectors will be\nmodulated. This in turn must lead to a modulation of the\naccretion torque locked in phase with the precession. It is\nprecisely this sort of modulation that we would expect to\nlead to a secular evolution in the wobble angle.\nLamb et al. (1975) demonstrated that such a modulation can be effective in exciting large amplitude precession\nof a rigid body, with an excitation timescale of the order of\nthe spin-up timescale, i.e. of the order of \u03c4a,\u03c6\u0307 in equation\n(53). For our more realistic stellar model this would correspond to an excitation on a timescale Icrust /I times shorter.\nA full description of the conditions under which such pumping can occur would require a detailed understanding of the\naccretion process. Such a description is still not available.\nTo re-enforce the potential complexity of this problem,\nthe time variation of each vector involved in this problem is\nsummarised in table 1. Note that the vector ndisk describing the plane of the disk is not well-defined. Far from the\ncentral star the disk is likely to be planar. However, Vietri\n& Stella (1998) have argued that a non-aligned dipole will\ntend to lift plasma out of the disk plane. In the inner disk,\nviscosity will not be effective in preventing this out-of-plane\nmotion. The inner disk will then undergo a forced precession\nwith its normal moving in a cone about the star's angular\nmomentum.\nA complete description of how this modulates the\ntorque on the star has not been attempted previously, and\nlies beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, it seems\nlikely that at least part of the torque will be locked in phase\nwith the disk precession. This torque would be most effective in exciting stellar free precession if the inner disk rotated at a rate close to the stellar spin frequency, or-more\naccurately-at the frequency \u03c6\u0307. However, for all sensible parameters the Lense-Thirring precession frequency of the inner disk is much less than the star's spin frequency. This\nwill lead to a rapid averaging of the effects of the torque on\nthe wobble angle. It therefore seems unlikely that the forced\nprecession of the inner disk plays a crucial role in wobble\npumping. We will simply note that the notion of a single\nfixed disk orientation is flawed. The vector ndisk in table 1\nshould be regarded as an average orientation, which will describe well the outer part of the disk, but not necessarily the\ninner part. Given that the accretion torque may be sensitive\nto the relative orientation of each possible pair of vectors in\ntable 1 the full behaviour is complex, with the torque being\nmodulated on a number of timescales.\nTo gain a little more insight consider the toy model\nwhere the torque on the star always points along ndisk , but\nhas a magnitude that monotonically increases with the angle between ndisk and m. Then by considering the relative\norientation of the vectors of table (1) it is straightforward\nto find a precessional phase at which the torque, when averaged over several spin periods, pumps the precession. This\noccurs even when the wobble angle is initially zero. However, half a precession period (i.e. \u03c0/\u03c8\u0307) later the relative\npositions of m, nd , J have changed. Then, again when averaged over several spin periods, it is found that the wobble\nis either damped (if \u03b8 < \u03c7) or pumped (when \u03b8 > \u03c7), but\nthis pumping is not as strong as before. This is an example\nof an oscillatory torque. However, the monotonicity guaranc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n9\n\ntees that the pumping over one half of a precessional phase\nexceeds the damping over the next, giving rise to a secular\nincrease in \u03b8 which depends on the values of \u03b8 and \u03c7. In\nthe limit of small wobble angles this increase is proportional\nto \u03b8, giving exponential pumping. Thus, even this simple\nmodel reproduces a number of the features identified in the\ngeneral arguments above.\nA more sophisticated model is provided by Wang &\nRobnik (1982). Here, the torque on the star is modelled using\na magnetospheric interaction. The field outside of the star\nis the sum of the usual dipole field plus an additional field\ndue to currents induced in the disk. This additional field is\nsupposed to be toroidal with respect to the disk's symmetry\naxis and to be significant only near the magnetic poles of\nthe star. Wang & Robnik then calculated the torque due to\nthe interaction between this toroidal field and the currents\ninternal to the star. They found that the torque on the star\nwas qualitatively of the same form as the torque that will\nbe considered in section 6 when we look at electromagnetic\ntorques on isolated pulsars. As will be shown in detail, such\na torque leads to oscillatory pumping, and also to a secular\nevolution in \u03b8, which for small wobble angles is exponential\nin nature. Again, a simple model has reproduced a number\nof the features identified in the general arguments.\nOf course, the rather general frequency counting arguments above tell us little about the magnitude of the modulation. Neither do they say whether the precession is pumped\nor damped. Resolution of such issues requires a detailed\nmodel of how the torque depends on the angles involved.\nNevertheless, they show that pumping mechanism could apply in accreting systems. We will now consider the particular\ncases of exponential, linear and impulsive pumping and investigate the gravitational wave fields they would produce.\n\n5.1\n\nExponential accretion torques\n\nIn this case equation (41) applies, with \u03c4pump = \u03c4a,\u03b8 . As\ndescribed in section 4.2, we will divide our analysis into two\nparts-one where internal dissipation is ignored, and the\nother where gravitational radiation reaction is ignored.\nBegin by neglecting internal dissipation. Then arguments identical to those of section (4.2), save for the replacement of \u03c4pump with \u03c4a,\u03b8 , lead to the upper bounds\nh(\u03c4a = \u03c4g,\u03b8 ) = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221225\n\n\u0010\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0011\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u00132/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(57)\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(58)\n\nfor f < f\u03b8 and\nh(\u03c4a = \u03c4g,\u03b8 ) = 7.4 \u00d7 10\u221226\n\n\u0010u\n\nbreak\n10\u22123\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0011 \u0010 1 kpc \u0011\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\nr\n\n\u00138/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\nfor f > f\u03b8 .\nNow neglect gravitational radiation reaction.

Also note that the motion of m is rather complicated-it moves on a cone of half-angle \u03c7\nabout nd , while nd itself moves on a cone of half-angle \u03b8 about J.

We therefore see that the\nwave amplitude due to exponential pumping by accretion\ntorques is almost certainly limited to undetectable values\nby internal dissipation. We will not consider this mechanism\nany further.\n\nImpulsive accretion torques\n\nWe will now discuss a pumping mechanism that will apply even in the absence of the gating described previously.\nSuppose the accreting plasma is clumped, and is not entirely confined to the plane perpendicular to the star's rotation axis. Various instabilities are likely to lead to such\na situation, as discussed in Lamb et al. (1985). Indeed, the\nclumping of accreting plasma is a key ingredient of the 'beatfrequency' models. These ascribe the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in many X-ray systems to a variability in\nthe accretion rate. This variability is due to a beating between the frequency of the innermost stable orbit and the\nstar's spin frequency. It therefore seems likely that the phenomenon of clumping in accreting systems is generic.\nDenote by \u2206t1 the (average) timescale in which a clump\ntransfers its angular momentum to the star. The wobble\nangle will change impulsively due to the accretion of such\nclumps providing the transfer of angular momentum takes\nplace over a narrow range of rotational phase, i.e. providing \u2206t1 \u226a P , where P denotes the star's spin period. If\nin addition the clumps arrive at random time intervals of\naverage \u2206t2 then, providing Pfp \u226a \u2206t2 , a random walk in\n\u03b8 will occur, even though no gating occurs. In the absence\nof gravitational radiation reaction and internal damping the\nwobble angle will then grow as t1/2 . This is clearly a less effective pumping mechanism than the linear one considered\npreviously, and so will not lead to interesting gravitational\nwave amplitude.\n\n6\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC TORQUES\n\nModels of the electromagnetic torque on a spinning neutron star have split into two classes-the Goldreich & Julian\n(1969) model where a dipolar magnetic field embedded in a\nthe star generates a strong electric field at the stellar surface\nwhich rips out charged particles. These then propagate along\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nthe magnetic field lines, forming a magnetosphere. This applies even when the dipole and rotation axes coincide. The\nradiation the charged particles emit then carries energy away\nfrom the star, implying the existence of a braking torque.\nThe second class does not have a magnetosphere, and\ninstead models the star as a perfect conductor with a magnetic dipole embedded, surrounded by vacuum (Ostriker &\nGunn 1969). If the dipole is inclined to the rotation axis,\nelectromagnetic radiation at the spin frequency is emitted.\nThis provides the braking torque. Such models are clearly\noversimplified. However, the magnetosphere models are so\ncomplicated that very little progress has been made in understanding their details (Michel 1991); questions such as\nhow the electromagnetic torque depends upon the angle\nbetween the spin axis and dipole axis remain unanswered.\nTherefore, in this section we will look at a magnetospherefree model in which the torque has been calculated as a function of the spin and dipole moment vectors. Even though the\ndetails of such a model may prove to be incorrect, it is likely\nthat it will reproduce qualitatively many features of real\nstars, and in particular identify the important timescales\ninvolved.\nMost discussions of magnetosphere-free torques are\nbased on the model of Deutsch (1955), who considered a\nperfectly conducting sharply bounded sphere, rigidly rotating in a vacuum. The internal magnetic field was assumed\nto be symmetric about some axis inclined to the axis of rotation. The external magnetic and electric fields were then\ncalculated. These fields were then used by Davis & Goldstein (1970) and Michel & Goldwire (1970) to calculate the\ntorque on the star. These authors investigated the effect of\nthis torque on spherical stars. They were able to show that\nthe torque caused the magnetic dipole to align with the rotation axis on the electromagnetic spin-down timescale.\nGoldreich (1970) extended the analysis to examine the\neffect of torques on precessing bodies. He showed that when\nthe free precession period was less than the electromagnetic\nspin-down timescale the non-sphericity completely altered\nthe body's evolution-the magnetic moment no longer aligns\nwith the spin axis. Instead the torque serves to either pump\nor damp any free precession the body may be undergoing,\ndepending upon whether the angle \u03c7 between the dipole moment and the body's deformation axis is greater or smaller\nthan sin\u22121 (2/3)1/2 \u2248 55\u25e6 , respectively. We will refer to this\nprocess as the Goldreich mechanism. This is very different\nfrom the gravitational radiation reaction case, in which the\nwobble motion is always damped (Cutler & Jones 2000).\nThe issue of calculating the electromagnetic torque was\ntaken up again by Good & Ng (1985). Much of their analysis\nwas concerned with Goldreich-Julian type magnetosphere\ntorques. However, in the course of their calculation they\nfound an error in the Deutsch fields. When this is taken\ninto account the Deutsch vacuum torque T is given by:\nT \u2261 T1 +T2 =\n\n2\u03a92\n1\n(\u03a9\u00d7m)\u00d7m \u2212\n(\u03a9*m)(\u03a9\u00d7m)(61)\n3c3\n5Rc2\n\nwhere \u03a9 denotes the angular velocity, R the stellar radius\nand m the dipole moment. (The only difference between\nthis and the torque as calculated from the original Deutsch\npaper is a factor of \u22121/5 in T2 ).\nThe first term, T1 , has components both parallel and\nperpendicular to the spin axis, and scales as \u03a93 . It is known\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n11\n\nas a non-anomalous torque. It causes the energy and angular\nmomentum of the star to decrease. Its component parallel to\nJ is responsible for spin-down, while its component perpendicular to J will bring about a secular change in the wobble\nangle.\nThe second term, T2 , is exactly perpendicular to the\nangular velocity and scales as \u03a92 . It is known as an anomalous torque, and is caused by the near-zone fields. It does\nnot lead to a loss in energy or angular momentum. This\ntorque does affect the wobble angle and spin rate of a freely\nprecessing star, but its effects average to zero over one free\nprecession period.\nFollowing equation (61) we will define two timescales to\ncharacterise the torque. The first corresponds to T1 and is\nsimply the spin-down timescale f /f \u0307 = 3Ic3 /2R6 \u03c6\u03072 B 2 :\n3\n\n\u03c4e = 3.64 \u00d7 10 yr\n\n\u0012\n\n1012 G\nB\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u00132 \u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n.\nsin2 \u03c7\n\n(62)\n\nThe corresponding timescale on which this torque would\nevolve the wobble angle is Icrust /I shorter than this. In the\nabove formula, and those that follow, we will place the geometric factors that follow from the particular form of vector\nand scalar products of equation (61) in square brackets. In\nthis way it will be clear what conclusions can be drawn if\nonly the approximate timescales of the model hold, i.e. if in\nmore realistic magnetosphere models the above geometric\nfactors were found to be incorrect. Such a situation would\ncorrespond to replacing the term in square brackets with\nsome other geometric factor.\nThe second timescale corresponds to T2 and we define\nas\n\u03c4\u0302e = 76.2 yr\n\n\u0012\n\n1012 G\nB\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u0013\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n.\nsin2 \u03c7\n\n(63)\n\nIt is a factor \u03a9R/c shorter than \u03c4e . Again, the corresponding timescale on which this torque would evolve the wobble\nangle is Icrust /I shorter than this.\nThus the effects of the two torque terms are qualitatively different. The term T1 results in a secular variation\nin the free precession angle and spin rate on the electromagnetic spin-down timescale. The term T2 produces no\nsuch secular variation. Instead it causes oscillations in the\nspin frequency and wobble angle on the (much shorter) free\nprecession timescale. We will refer to this as a non-secular\nmechanism. We will examine both torques in terms of their\neffect on gravitational wave generation below.\n\n6.1\n\nNon-secular electromagnetic torques\n\nThe torque T2 has received very little attention previously,\nundoubtedly because it does not cause any secular variation in the star's motion. However, as can be deduced from\nequation (61) its magnitude and orientation with respect to\nthe reference plane varies over one precession period, as m\nrotates with respect to this plane. Recently Melatos (1999)\nmade use of this torque to model spin-down irregularities in\nmagnetars, modelled as rigid bodies. He considered the case\nwhere the timescale \u03c4\u0302e was of similar duration to the free precession period: \u03c4\u0302e \u223c Pfp . This similarity of timescales gives\na rather irregular or 'bumpy' spin-down rate, which Melatos\ncalculated numerically. We will take a somewhat simpler\n\n\f12\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\nview-when \u03c4\u0302e is longer than Pfp the effect of the torque\nwill be to simply cause a smooth variation of free precession parameters (e.g. \u03b8 and \u03c6\u0307) calculable using perturbation\ntheory. Even when the two timescales become comparable\nwe would expect our results to apply to order-of-magnitude\naccuracy.\nSubstitution of T2 into (12) shows that for small wobble\nangles, \u03b8 varies sinusoidally, giving oscillatory pumping of\nthe form discussed previously. An estimate of the magnitude\nof this angle follows from the timescale \u03c4\u0302e described above:\n\u03b8ns \u223c\n\nPfp\n.\n\u03c4\u0302e Icrust /I\n\n(64)\n\nFrom equation (40) this leads to a wave field\nh\u223c\n\nG\u03c0 I0 2 1\n.\n\u03c6\u0307\n2c4 r\n\u03c4\u0302e\n\n(65)\n\nThis gives\n\u221228\n\nh = 1.8 \u00d7 10\n\n\u0010\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n1 yr\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0011\u0014\n\n3\n1\n5\u03c0 tan2 \u03c7\n\n\u0015\n\n(66)\n\nwhere we have parameterised in terms of \u03c4e rather than \u03c4\u0302e .\nAs above the geometric factor deduced from the full perturbative calculation has been separated from the rest of the\nformula.\nClearly this is extremely weak. The amplitude increases\nas the electromagnetic spin-down timescale decreases, so we\nshould focus attention on fast spinning strongly magnetised\nstars, i.e stars very soon after birth in supernovae. Such stars\nwill be hot, with temperatures of order 1011 K immediately\nafter birth. However, this mechanism can become active only\nwhen the outer phase has solidified to form a crust, and so\nwe can apply equation (66) only to stars which cool to the\nmelting temperature in a time less than \u03c4e .\nAs described in Haensel (1997), the crust will not have\na single well defined melting temperature, as the deeper\nparts (with density \u223c 1013 g cm2 ) will melt at temperatures just under 1010 K, while the outer crust (with density\n\u223c 1011 g cm2 ) will melt at temperatures just above 109 K.\nThere is therefore some ambiguity in what to take as an\naverage melting temperature, with a corresponding ambiguity in the timescale for crust formation. For the range of\ntemperature identified, an upper bound would be one year,\nwith a lower bound much shorter than this (Haensel 1997;\nShapiro & Teukolsky 1983).\nIf the solidification timescale is indeed of order one year,\nequation (66) then leads to the tiny signal of order 10\u221229\nfor a star born at the Galactic centre. To be detectable over\na one-year integration the geometric factor would have to\nexceed 102 , corresponding to very small dipole inclination\nangles, \u03c7 < 2\u25e6 .\nIf the star's outer layers were to cool more rapidly than\nthis we can consider the effective amplitude found by multiplying the wave amplitude by the square root of the number of revolutions performed in one electromagnetic braking\ntimescale:\nheff = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221226\n\n\u0010\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n1 yr\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00111/2\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\n\u00111/2 \u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n3\n.(67)\n5\u03c0 tan2 \u03c7\n\nEven with fast (less than one-year) cooling, a star born at\n\nthe Galactic centre remains undetectable unless the geometric factor amplifies the signal. A dipole inclination of 5\u25e6 gives\nan amplification of 25. At 100 Hz the signal is detectable for\n\u03c4e = 1 month, and a polar magnetic field of 2 \u00d7 1015 G.\nSuch an event could correspond to the birth of a magnetar. However, the event rate for such an occurrence is very\nlow-surely less than one a century, so that the probability\nof such a source being born during the operational lifetime\nof Advanced LIGO is small.\nThe torque T2 is due to the near-zone fields and does\nnot lead to energy being radiated to infinity. Therefore it\nis conceivable that it may continue to act in an accreting\nsystem. In this case the spin frequency would be maintained\nby the accretion torque. To obtain an upper bound on the\nwave field at a given frequency set \u03c4e equal to its minimum\nvalue as given by combining (54) and (62):\n\u03c4e = 3.4 \u00d7 107 yr\n\n\u0010\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\n\u00111/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(68)\n\nSubstituting this into equation (66) gives a maximum wave\namplitude of\nhmax (f ) = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221236\n\n\u0010\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u00131/3 \u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u0013\n\n. (69)\n\nThis is tiny even in comparison to the wave amplitudes from\nisolated stars. This is because in accreting systems the two\nfactors which give large wave amplitudes-high spin frequency and high polar magnetic field strength-compete.\nHighly magnetised stars have large Alfv\u00e9n radii and therefore low equilibrium spin rates.\nTo sum up, the non-secular electromagnetic torque does\nnot seem to be a good pumping mechanism for gravitational\nwave generation. Isolated stars at the Galactic centre with\nhigh spin frequencies and large magnetic field strengths can\nproduce detectable signals if the geometric factors which enter the calculation are favourable. However, if born in supernovae, their rapid spin-down rates would require extremely\nfast (less than one-year) cooling of the outer phases of the\nstar. Accreting stars where this near-zone torque continues\nto act produce even smaller gravitational wave signals, as\nthe requirements of high spin frequency and high magnetic\nfield strength oppose.\n6.2\n\nSecular electromagnetic torques\n\nHaving investigated the non-secular effect of electromagnetic\ntorques on gravitational wave generation we will now consider the possibility that such torques may pump precession\nin a secular way. Goldreich (1970) demonstrated that the\ntorque T1 of equation (61) does indeed lead to such evolution for a rigid body. This generalises at once to our elastic\nshell/fluid core model. Substitution of T1 into equations (11)\nand (12) leads to a set of two coupled differential equations\nconnecting \u03c6\u0307 and \u03b8. Providing the free precession period is\nless than the spin-down timescale we can average over a free\nprecession period to give:\n\u03c6\u0308 = \u2212\u03b1\u03c6\u03073 sin2 \u03c7\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n\n(70)\n\nI\n3\n\u03b1\u03c6\u03072 \u03b8\nsin2 \u03c7 \u2212 1 .\nIcrust\n2\n\nwhere\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(71)\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\n\u03b1=\n\n2m2\n.\n3Ic3\n\n(72)\n\n(Small terms proportional to \u2206Id /Icrust and \u03b82 have been\nneglected). Then the spin-down follows the usual power law:\n\u03c6\u0307 = \u03c6\u03070\n\n\u0014\n\n2 sin2 \u03c7t\n1+\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\n,\n\n(73)\n\nwhere \u03c4e is defined in equation (62). The wobble angle\nevolves according to\n\u03b8 = \u03b80\n\n\u0012\n\n1+\n\n2 sin2 \u03c7t\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0013\u03bb\n\n(74)\n\nwhere\n\u03bb=\n\n3\n2\n\nI\nIcrust\n\nsin2 \u03c7 \u2212 1\n.\n2 sin2 \u03c7\n\nFortunately it is possible to simplify the above equations somewhat. Firstly the gravitational radiation reaction\ntimescale for spin-down is much longer than for gravitational\nalignment, so in any situation where the timescales in (80)\nare similar the gravitational spin-down term is negligible, i.e.\nthe last term of (77) may be neglected. Also, the damping\ndue to gravitational radiation reaction will be much weaker\nthan the damping due to internal dissipation. Then the second term of (78) may be neglected.\nFor such a star the evolution in \u03c6\u0307 is driven only by\nthe electromagnetic torque and equation (73) applies. The\nevolution in \u03b8 is more complex. Integration of (78) depends\non the variation of \u2206Id with the frequency. We will consider\nthe case of Coulomb deformations, and assume \u2206Id \u221d \u03c6\u03072\n(i.e. that the crust is relaxed). We then find\n\n(75)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b80 1 +\n\nAs can be seen, \u03b8 increases or decreases depending upon the\nsign of 23 sin2 \u03c7 \u2212 1, and increases most rapidly for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 ,\nin which case\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b8(\u03c7 = 90\u25e6 ) = \u03b80 1 +\n\n2t\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0011I/4Icrust\n\n.\n\n(76)\n\nIn reality gravitational radiation reaction and internal\ndissipation will act on the spinning down star also, and so we\nshould include their effects. Then equations (70) and (71) acquire extra terms. The gravitational spin-down of equation\nis added to (70), while the gravitational alignment of equation (16) is added to (71). The internal dissipation alignment\nrate corresponding to equation (19) is added to (71).\nWe will present the \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 results where the electromagnetic pumping is greatest:\n\u03c6\u0308 = \u2212\u03b1\u03c6\u03073 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c6\u03075 \u03b82\n1 I\nI\n\u2206Id \u03c6\u0307\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n\u03b1\u03c6\u03072 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b2\n\u03c6\u03074 \u03b8 \u2212\n\u03b8\n2 Icrust\nIcrust\nIcrust 2\u03c0n\nwhere\n2G\n\u03b2 = 5 \u2206Id2 .\n5c I\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u03c4e,\u03b8\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4g,\u03b8\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n.\n\u03c4d\n\nIcrust\n.\nI\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03c4e\n6\u03c4d\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n1+\n\n2t\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(82)\n\nWe can now build up a picture of the evolution of a star\nwhich is acted upon by a secular electromagnetic torque of\nthis form. The scaling of the timescales with frequency are\ncrucial: \u03c4d \u221d 1/\u2206Id \u03c6\u0307 \u221d 1/\u03c6\u03073 , while \u03c4e \u221d 1/\u03c6\u03072 . If the star\nis born spinning sufficiently fast the steeper dependence of\n\u03c4d on frequency will give \u03c4d \u226a \u03c4e and the above equation\nreduces to\n\u0010 t\u0011\n\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b80 exp \u2212\n.\n(83)\n\u03c4d\n\n(78)\n\n(80)\n\n(81)\n\nNote that the timescales in this problem are functions of\nthe decreasing frequency, so this equation will generally not\nhave simple exponential solutions.\nWe will apply this formalism to a young rapidly spinning down neutron star. Its initial wobble may be due to\nglitches arising from the rapid spin-down (section 7), or due\nto some other process. We will not concern ourselves with\nthis issue here. We will simply examine the evolution of the\nprecession angle assuming that the Goldreich mechanism\nacts.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nexp\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b80 exp \u2212\n\nwhere for convenience we have introduced the electromagnetic wobble pumping timescale\n\u03c4e,\u03b8 = 2\u03c4e\n\n\u0011I/4Icrust\n\n(77)\n\n(79)\n\n1\n\n2t\n\u03c4e\n\nAs the star continues to spin-down the two timescales become comparable and eventually \u03b8 will begin to increase. At\nlate times equation (6.2) reduces to\n\nThe terms proportional to \u03b1 are due to electromagnetic\ntorques, those proportional to \u03b2 to gravitational torques,\nand the term proportional to n\u22121 describe internal damping. In terms of timescales equation (78) would be written\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u03b8\n\n13\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c4e\n\u03c4d\n\n\u0011i \u0010\n\n1+\n\n2t\n\u03c4e\n\n\u0011I/4Icrust\n\n.\n\n(84)\n\nThis is of the same form as (76), save for the extra exponential factor. This factor can be interpreted as the extent\nto which the wobble was damped early in the star's life. An\nexample of this behaviour is shown in figure 5. Time is measured in units of \u03c4e and we have chosen \u03c4d = 0.13\u03c4e . An\nexample of such a star where Coulomb forces provide the\ndistortion could have b = 10\u22125 , Icrust /I = 0.1, B = 1013\nG and an initial spin frequency of 200 Hz. Then \u03c4e = 9\nyears. The initial exponential decrease in \u03b8, on a timescale\nof approximately one year, is clearly seen. Of course, this neglects the possibility that a CFS-type instability (such as an\nr-mode) might rapidly break the star's rotation (Andersson\n& Kokkotas 2001).\nIn this way electromagnetic radiation reaction could\nprovide a way of setting young neutron stars into free precession. Given some initial non-zero wobble angle and the\ncondition \u03c4e,\u03b8 < \u03c4d , the wobble angle increases. Of course,\nthis increase will end when \u03b8 reaches the maximum value\nas set by the crustal breaking stress. From that point on\nthe wobble angle will remain fixed at its maximum value,\nwhile the spin frequency continues to decrease according\nto equation (73). The gravitational wave amplitude is proportional to \u2206Id \u03c6\u03072 . Given our assumption \u2206Id \u221d \u03c6\u03072 , this\nleads to a wave amplitude proportional to \u03c6\u03074 , which in turn\nevolves as (1 + 2t/\u03c4e )\u22122 . In other words, for all but the earliest stages of evolution the gravitational wave amplitude de-\n\n\f14\n\nD. I. Jones and N.

The evolution in the wobble angle \u03b8 under the action of combined internal dissipation and electromagnetic torques.\nWe have put \u03c4e = 0.13 \u00d7 \u03c4g,\u03b8 . At early times the internal\ndissipation dominates and \u03b8 decreases exponentially. At later\ntimes the electromagnetic torque dominates and \u03b8 increases as\n(1 + 2t/\u03c4e )I/4Icrust .\n\ncreases steadily with time-we have been able to maintain\na non-zero wobble angle only at the expense of introducing\na powerful spin-down torque. The gravitational wave amplitude decreases on a timescale of order \u03c4e . In section 7 we\nwill look at the wave field due to a population of young unmagnetised isolated stars, set into free precession at (or very\nsoon after) birth, whose precession angles then decay on the\ninternal damping timescale \u03c4d . Given that the wave field of\nthe magnetised stars considered in this section decays on the\ntimescale \u03c4e,\u03b8 < \u03c4d , the magnetised stars are not as easily\ndetectable, and so we will not pursue them further. Rather,\nin section 7 we will consider in detail the signal strength\nand population statistics of young unmagnetised stars, and\nfind that for realistic values of the damping parameter n,\ndetection of such a population is not likely.\nTo summarise, this non-secular electromagnetic pumping can increase the wobble angle of an isolated star. However, once the wobble angle has increased to its maximum\nvalue the associated spin-down torques dominate the evolution in the wave signal, with the result that the amplitude\ndecreases on the electromagnetic spin-down timescale.\nThis motivates us to consider the possibility that secular\nelectromagnetic pumping remains active even in an accreting system: The accretion torque could then maintain the\nstar's spin frequency, while the electromagnetic torque maintains the free precession. It is more difficult to justify this\ncombining of accretion and electromagnetic torques than in\nthe case of the non-secular electromagnetic torque, as a secular variation in \u03b8 changes the energy and angular momentum of the star, and so must correspond to fluxes of energy\nand angular momentum to infinity. Certainly it is clear that\nthe exact form of the torque T1 will no longer apply, as its\nspin-down part at least will be suppressed by the accretion\nenvironment. We will therefore dispense with the details of\nthe above, i.e. the \u03c7 and numerical factors, and will assume\nthat the star is in spin equilibrium as described by standard\naccretion theory. Then the star is modelled by\n\n(86)\n\nThe timescales in (85) are constant by virtue of (86),\nand so the solution will be exponential in form. However,\nwe now have to include the details of the accretion spin-up\ntorque, the electromagnetic pumping torque, and internal\ndissipation. In fact, it is possible to combine formulae describing these three phenomena to obtain an upper bound\non the gravitational wave signal independent of the mechanism producing the deformation. Firstly, we can combine\nequation (62) for the electromagnetic spin-down time with\nequation(54) which gives the maximum spin frequency of a\nstar with a given magnetic fields strength and a given accretion rate. This provides the lower bound on \u03c4e given by\nequation (68). However, for the Goldreich mechanism to be\noperative we must have \u03c4e,\u03b8 = 2\u03c4e Icrust /I < \u03c4d . The above\nequation can then be used to give a lower bound on \u03c4d , at\na given spin frequency, accretion rate and value of Icrust /I.\nBut \u03c4d \u221d Icrust /\u2206Id , and so we obtain an upper bound\non \u2206Id . This immediately become an upper bound on the\ngravitational wave amplitude. Carrying out the arithmetic\nwe find:\nh(\u03c4e = \u03c4d ) = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221231\n\n\u0012\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u0010\n\nfor f < f\u03b8 and\nh(\u03c4e = \u03c4d ) = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221231\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\nn\n107\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\nn\n107\n\nubreak\n10\u22123\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nf\n100 Hz\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u00112/3\n\n1 kpc\nr\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40E\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n(87)\n\n100 Hz\nf\n\n\u00134/3\n\n\u0011\n\n(88)\n\nfor f > f\u03b8 . This is a tiny amplitude. Even for n = 107 it\nreaches a maximum of only 10\u221230 , at a frequency of 69 Hz for\nthe values of ubreak chosen. Therefore the gravitational wave\namplitude of accreting stars acted upon by electromagnetic\ntorques of this form is limited to uninteresting values by\ninternal dissipation.\nTo conclude, secular electromagnetic torques are not\nlikely to lead to detectable levels of gravitational radiation.\nIn the case of isolated stars the torque may be able to increase an initially small wobble angle to its maximum value,\nbut only at the expense of introducing a strong spin-down\ntorque. Even if this part of the torque were to remain active\nin accreting stars the wave amplitudes are uninteresting.\nThe bound on h obtained by considering the competition\nbetween the electromagnetic torque and the internal dissipation timescale leads to a bound on h much lower than\neven the Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We will therefore not\nconsider the effects of electromagnetic torques any further.\n\n7\n\nNATAL PRECESSION AND GLITCHES\n\nGiven their violent birth in supernovae it is tempting to examine the possibility that neutron stars are set into precession when born. As discussed in section 6.1, the high temperatures generated by the implosion will lead to entirely\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nfluid stars. Only when the outer layers have cooled will a\nsolid crust form. It is possible that when the crust is in the\nprocess of solidifying a substantial excitation of a mode of\noscillation of the fluid exists. This excitation could simply\nbe due to the supernova explosion itself, or could be due to a\nCFS-type instability. Such a scenario has already been investigated in the context of r-modes, where the crust formation\nwas a hindrance to gravitational wave emission (Lindblom,\nOwen & Ushomirsky 2000; Andersson et al. 2000). The exact\noutcome is not clear, particularly as the crust will not solidify at all points simultaneously, but will form first where\nthe fluid velocity is smallest. Given the complexity of the\nprocess, the possibility of the crust/fluid core system being\ncreated in a precessional state cannot be ruled out.\nEven if the star has settled down into an axisymmetric\nconfiguration at the time of crust solidification, it is possible\nthat it might be set into free precession soon after. As noted\nby Lyne (1996), the phenomenon of glitching-the sudden\nincrease in spin frequency of a pulsar-is most common in\nyoung pulsars. This phenomenon certainly requires a solid\ncrust. Therefore, a young neutron star that has cooled sufficiently will begin to glitch. Also, some theories of glitching\nassociate the sudden change in spin frequency with a fracture in the crustal structure (see Ruderman (1976, 1991a,b)\nand Link, Franco & Epstein (1998) for details). If this change\nresults in a shift in the principal axis of the moment of inertia tensor the star will precess ( Pines & Shaham 1973a;\nPines & Shaham 1973b; Link, Franco & Epstein 1998). In\nthis way it is possible that stars may acquire a precessional\nmotion very soon after birth.\nWe therefore wish to investigate the gravitational wave\nbackground due to a population of young spinning-down\nneutron stars that were set into precession at, or soon after,\nbirth. We will describe this as natal precession. Although we\nhave identified fluid modes and glitches as possible ways of\nproducing this natal precession, the following analysis would\napply regardless of the source of the wobble.\n\n7.1\n\n15\n\nFigure 6. The effective amplitude from an isolated star which initially precesses at its maximum wobble angle with damping due to\ngravitational radiation reaction only. We have put ubreak = 10\u22123\nand r = 1 kpc, and have assumed that the matched filter accumulates signal for an interval \u03c4 defined in equation (89) or for an\ninterval of one year, whichever is shorter. The deformation is due\nto Coulomb forces, with rigidity parameters b = 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 and\n10\u22125 as indicated. The knee that appears on the b = 10\u22123 curve\nis due to the gravitational radiation reaction timescale falling to\nbelow one year at high rotation rate, limiting the signal accumulated by a matched filter.\n\nGravitational wave amplitudes\n\nWe will not include any pumping mechanisms in our analysis, so that the wobble angle simply decays under the combined influence of internal dissipation and gravitational radiation reaction. Also, we will begin by considering stars for\nwhich electromagnetic spin-down torques are negligible. We\nwould then have\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212\u03b8\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u03c4g,\u03b8\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u03c4d\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03b8\n\u2261\u2212 .\n\u03c4\n\n(89)\n\nIf we set the initial wobble angle equal to its maximum value\nwe have\n\u0010 t\u0011\n(90)\n\u03b8(t) = \u03b8max exp \u2212\n\u03c4\n\nfor t > 0 and is zero for t < 0.\nIn order to gain insight into the detectability of the\ngravitational wave field due to such a source we shall assume\nthat a matched filter can accumulate signal only for an interval \u03c4 or for an interval of one year, whichever is shorter. Figures 6 and 7 show the effective amplitude for a star deformed\nby crustal Coulomb forces, with a strain angle ubreak = 10\u22123 ,\nat a distance 1 kpc. Each figure plots h for three different\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 7. The effective amplitude from an isolated star with the\nsame parameters and assumptions as in figure (6), except now\nn = 104 . This corresponds to the upper limit on n as estimated\nby Alpar & Sauls (1988).\n\nvalues of the rigidity parameter: b = 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 and 10\u22125 .\nWe have assumed a reference oblateness equal to that of\na rotating fluid, i.e. \u01eb0 = \u01eb\u03a9 , so that \u2206Id = 3Istar b\u01eb\u03a9 /2.\nIn figure 6 only the gravitational radiation reaction term of\nequation (89) is included, i.e. this is the n \u2192 \u221e limit. Figure\n7 has n = 104 , which is the upper bound on n based on the\narguments of Alpar & Sauls (1988). This level of damping\nreduces the signal significantly as compared to figure 6 for\nfrequencies in excess of 100 Hz. For example, a b = 10\u22123\nstar is now barely detectably by a first generation interferometer, while the more plausible b = 10\u22125 star is now barely\ndetectable by an Advanced LIGO.\n\n\f16\n7.2\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\nStatistical arguments\n\nSuch plots as these are useful as they show how the strength\nof the internal damping affects the strength of the gravitational wave signal from an isolated star. However, in order\nto decide whether such sources are of interest it is necessary\nto consider the related issues of their event rate and distance\nfrom the Earth. To do this we need to consider the statistics\nof neutron star births.\nThe analogous problem of the gravitational signals due\nto a population of young non-precessing triaxial neutron\nstars spinning down due to gravitational wave emission has\nbeen considered by Blandford as reported in Thorne (1987).\nBlandford made use of the following argument: Consider a\nsource born in a supernova explosion that is spinning down\non a timescale \u03c4 . Then there will be \u03c4 /\u2206tSN such sources\nwith age \u03c4 or younger in the Galaxy, where \u2206tSN is the interval between Galactic supernovae. Blandford then modelled\nthe Galaxy as a flat disk of radius R, which allowed him to\nestimate the distance to the nearest such source. He then\ncombined this result with gravitational spin-down and wave\namplitude formulae from the quadrupole formalism to show\nthat the gravitational signal arriving\n\u221a at Earth from the nearest such source is proportional to \u2206tSN and is independent\nof the source's frequency or triaxial ellipticity.\nWe wish to make the analogous argument for a population of young isolated precessing neutron stars. We will\nfollow Blandford and consider stars where electromagnetic\ntorques are not important. We have already shown in section 6.2 that electromagnetic torques can, if the Goldreich\npumping mechanism is active, cause young neutron stars to\nbe set into free precession, but only at the cost of introducing a powerful spin-down torque, and so a population of\nunmagnetised stars is probably more easily detectable than\na population of magnetised ones.\nThe relevant timescale \u03c4 on which the gravitational\nwave signal decreases is no longer the gravitational spindown timescale, but is instead the free precession alignment\ntimescale, dominated in almost all physically plausible scenarios by internal dissipation. This means that Blandford's\ntriaxial result where h is a function of \u2206tSN only no longer\nholds.\nWe will model the Galaxy as having a radius R and\nthickness D, giving a volume of order R2 D. This contains\n\u03c4 /\u2206tSN stars of age \u03c4 or younger. The average separation\nof this population of young stars is then (\u2206tSN R2 D/\u03c4 )1/3 .\nExplicitly\n\u2206r = 1.4 kpc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206tSN\n30 yr\n\n\u00131/3 \u0012\n\n103 yr\n\u03c4\n\n\u00131/3\n\n(91)\n\nwhere we have put R = 10 kpc and D = 1 kpc. Of course,\na more accurate model would take into account the rate\nof star formation as a function of Galactic position, with\ndifferent rates applying in the central bulge and spiral arms,\nfor instance. Nevertheless, equation (91) represents a useful\nfirst approximation.\nEquations (36) and (37) give the wave amplitude of a\nprecessing star in terms of r, f and \u03c4d . We can then set r\nequal to \u2206r as given in equation (91). The wave amplitude\nthus obtained will, subject to statistical variation, be the\nfield at Earth due to the closest source of age \u03c4d or less.

We are considering stars with \u03c4 in excess of 30\nyears, so these wave amplitudes can be compared against the\nnoisecurves for 1-year matched filter integrations, e.g. the\nnoisecurves of figure (4). As can be seen, signals of h = 10\u221227\nlie above the Advanced LIGO noisecurve for a wide range of\nfrequencies (25 \u2192 400 Hz) which may well include the initial\nspin frequencies of neutron stars. However, we are considering a 'blind search' i.e. an all-sky search without any prior\nknowledge of the source's position and little idea of its spin\nfrequency. In order to minimise numerically-generated false\nalarms we will therefore take our detection criterion to be\nh > 10\u221226 . Also we will set ubreak = 10\u22123 . For definiteness\nconsider the case where all stars are born with a spin frequency f = 100 Hz. If we consider the optimistic case where\ninternal dissipation is neglected (n \u2192 \u221e) then the above\nequations show that the nearest such star is detectable for\n\u03c4 < 30 years. This is on the edge of the applicability of our\nsimple statistical model-there would only be one such star\nin the Galaxy! The probability of detecting such an object\nduring the lifetime of an Advanced LIGO detector would be\nborderline. At follows at once that damping parameters of\nless than n = 107 would be unlikely to lead to a detectable\npopulation of isolated stars.\nIf, when the advanced detectors go on line, advances in\ncomputer power, detector noisecurves or search algorithm\ndesign permit a more sensitive search down to h = 10\u221227 ,\nthen we obtain \u03c4d = 103 years for detection. There would\nbe a population of around 30 stars of this age or less in\nthe Galaxy. Equation (91) shows that the closest would be\nabout 1 kpc from the Earth. Figure 6 shows that in the case\nof Coulomb deformations such a star would have to have\na rigidity parameter of 10\u22124 , an order of magnitude larger\nthan the canonical value.\nWe are now in a position to summarise our results. We\nhave considered the wave field due to a population of isolated\nstars set into precession with \u03b8 = \u03b8max soon after birth. The\nsignal following matched filtering is shown in figures 6 and\n7 for the case of Coulomb deformations with ubreak = 10\u22123\nand r = 1 kpc. They suggest that even for damping as strong\nas n = 104 , a star with rigidity parameter b = 10\u22124 is detectable out to about 1 kpc by an Advanced LIGO. However, when the statistics of neutron star births are included\nit is found that with this level of internal damping it is unlikely that, at a given time, there exists such a precessing\nstar in the Galaxy. However, the situation is very different if\nthe internal damping is much weaker. In the limit where it\nnegligible, with a detection threshold of 10\u221226 it is borderline as to whether or not there will exist a detectable star\nin the Galaxy. If this threshold can be decreased to 10\u221227 ,\nthen there could exist a detectable star as close at 1 kpc\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nto Earth. If deformed by Coulomb forces, such a star would\nrequire a rigidity parameter of 10\u22124 at least.\n\n8\n\nCOLLISIONS IN DENSE ENVIRONMENTS\n\nThe possibility of detecting gravitational waves from neutron stars set into free precession following collisions with\nother stars has recently been discussed in the literature. de\nAraujo et al. (1994) first pointed out that the high stellar\ndensities of globular clusters could lead to a high rate of\ncollision between neutron stars and other stars. Given that\nglobular clusters contain an excess of millisecond pulsars,\nthe latter authors argued that if such collisions were effective in exciting precession, interesting levels of gravitational\nwave emission would occur.\nThis idea was taken up by Velloso et al. (1997) who\nestimated possible gravitational wave amplitudes at Earth\nbased on the millisecond pulsar data for the globular clusters. However, the formulae employed were taken from de\nAraujo et al. (1994) who effectively assumed that the stars\nwere rigid, with an oblateness \u01eb\u03a9 . This gave h \u221d \u03c6\u03072 \u01eb\u03a9 \u03b8\nand \u03c4g,\u03b8 \u221d 1/\u01eb2\u03a9 . At a given wobble angle and spin frequency this led to a wave amplitude too large by a factor\nof \u01eb\u03a9 /\u01ebd \u2248 1/b and an alignment timescale too fast by the\nfactor (\u01eb\u03a9 /\u01ebd )2 \u2248 1/b2 .\nIn this section we will reconsider the issue of collisioninduced precession. In the terminology of section 4 this is an\nexample of an impulsive pumping mechanism. This problem\nis very similar to that considered in the last section, natal\nprecession, as we are again considering the wave field due\nto stars set into precession at positions and times which\ncan only be described in a statistical way, and then spindown and align. Indeed, the problem again breaks down\nneatly into two parts. The first concerns identifying particular mechanisms, i.e. types of collision, that lead to an\ninteresting level of free precession. The second concerns finding an event rate for such an occurrence, so that a statistical statement can be made regarding the likely detectability.\nNote that as the nearest cluster is of order 1 kpc from Earth,\nequations (36) and (37) show that a safe condition for de3\ntectability is \u03c4g,\u03b8 <\n\u223c 10 years, with the very optimistic as7\nsumptions n = 10 and a detection threshold of h = 10\u221227 .\nAdditionally, we see from figure 6 and equation (24) that\nfor a star with b = 10\u22123 and ubreak = 10\u22123 spinning at several 100 Hz, a wobble angle of order 10\u22123 is required for a\nsignal-to-noise of 10. We therefore need to identify types of\ncollision involving at least one recycled neutron star which\nproduce precession angles of order 10\u22123 and have an event\nrate of order 1/1000 yr\u22121 . These arguments are somewhat\nsimpler than those used in the last section, but will suffice\nfor this section, as we will find very small event rates for\ncollision, so that it will be clear that we can rule out collisions as a mechanism for generating detectable gravitational\nwaves.\n8.1\n\nCollisions of neutron stars with non-compact\nstars\n\nWe begin by considering the collision of a neutron star with a\nnon-compact star. Such collisions have been modelled extensively, e.g. Davis, Benz and Hills (1992), who model neutron\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n17\n\nstar-main sequence star collisions, and also neutron star-red\ngiant collisions. In the main sequence star case they find\nthat a system consisting of a neutron star surrounded by a\nthick accretion disk is formed when the separation at periastron is <\n\u223c 1.75 times the main sequence star's radius. In\nthe red giant case they find that a common-envelope system\nis formed when the separation at periastron is <\n\u223c 2.5 times\nthe red giant radius. For periastron separations significantly\ngreater than these values they find that the perturbation of\nthe non-compact star is minimal.\nDespite the violent effect such near-body encounters\nhave on the non-compact star it is difficult to see how the\nneutron star would be set into free precession by such a collision. As will be shown in section 8.2, the gravitational tidal\ntorque on the neutron star due to the non-compact star is\nnegligible. This leaves only the material torque on the neutron star, which will be determined by accretion flow onto\nits surface. This will be described by the standard theory,\nregardless of the unusual source of the accreting material.\nThe accretion rate will be limited to the Eddington value in\nthe usual manner, so the torque will not be impulsive.\nIt follows that although collisions between neutron stars\nand non-compact stars are important in terms of the population evolution of globular clusters, they are not of use as a\nmechanism for free precession gravitational wave production\nas it is impossible to identify a way in which the collision\nwould set the star into free precession.\n\n8.2\n\nNeutron star-neutron star encounters\n\nWe will now consider encounters between two neutron stars.\nClearly, if a direct collision were to occur, free precession\nwould be the last gravitational wave mechanism that we\nwould wish to consider. We will therefore model a near collision, where both gravitational and magnetic effects will\ncome into play, but there is no direct mechanical contact\nbetween the stars. We will begin by considering the gravitational interaction in a simple Newtonian way. Suppose\none star has a spin-angular momentum J and centrifugal\ndeformation \u2206I\u03a9 . Then the other star will exert a torque\non this bulge, causing a forced precession. (It is this process\nthat is responsible for the Earth's (forced) 'precession of the\nequinoxes' on a 26,000 year timescale, as the Sun and Moon\nexert a torque on the Earth's centrifugal deformation). The\nmagnitude of the torque acting on the star is given by (Goldstein 1980):\nT =\n\n3GM\n\u2206I\u03a9 sin 2\u03b2,\n2r 3\n\n(94)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the angle that the angular momentum of this star\nmakes with the normal to the plane in which the stars move,\nM is the mass of the other star and r denotes the stars'\nseparation. This torque acts perpendicular to the plane containing the stars and J . We can write the quantity \u2206I\u03a9 in\nterms of the rotation frequency \u03a9 using equation (13):\n\u2206I\u03a9 = I\n\n3 \u03a92 R3\n.\n2 GM\n\n(95)\n\nThis gives\nT =\n\n9\nI\u03a92 R3 sin 2\u03b2.\n4r 3\n\n(96)\n\n\f18\n\nD. I. Jones and N. Andersson\n\nAs the two stars approach one another this torque will\ngrow and change in orientation. If the stars pass very close to\none another the steep r \u22123 factor will give rise to an almost\nimpulsive torque, acting when the stars are at and close\nto periastron, where the r \u22123 factor is at a maximum. If the\ninterval in which the bulk of the angular momentum transfer\ntakes place is much less than the spin period of the star the\ntransfer will take place at nearly constant rotational phase,\ni.e. nearly constant reference plane orientation. It follows\nthat the star would then be set into free precession with a\nwobble angle of order\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u2248\n\n\u03b4J I\nT\n\u2248\n.\nJ Icrust\nIcrust \u03a92\n\n(97)\n\nInserting T as given by equation (96) then gives\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u2248\n\n9\n4\n\n\u0010 \u00113\nR\nd\n\nsin 2\u03b2\n\nI\n,\nIcrust\n\n(98)\n\nwhere d denotes the separation at periastron.\nWe therefore see that collisions capable of producing\nsignificant wobble angles (\u03b8 \u223c 10\u22123 ) could conceivably occur, but would require very close encounters, with a periastron passage of no more than ten neutron star radii:\nd \u223c 10R. Of course, during such close passages relativistic effects will be important, e.g. Lense-Thirring precession.\nWe need not pursue these here. All that we require is an\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the collision cross section for\na significant interaction to occur. Note that equation (98)\nimmediately rules out tidal torques during near collisions\nbetween neutron stars and main sequence stars as a pump6\ning mechanism, due to the large (d >\n\u223c 10 km) periastron\nseparation.\nThere will be an interaction between the neutron stars'\nmagnetic moments also, as each dipole will tend to align with\nthe field of the other. The torque on a dipole of moment\nm in a field B due to the other star is of order mB. The\nfield B scales as r \u22123 . An argument analogous to the above\ngravitational one then leads to a wobble angle\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u2248 10\u221222\n\n\u0010 B \u0011 \u0010 B \u0011 \u0012 100 Hz \u00132 \u0010 10 km \u00113\n1\n2\n109 G\n\n1012 G\n\nf\n\nd\n\n, (99)\n\nwhere B1 and B2 denote the polar field strengths of the two\nstars. We have parameterised in terms of field strengths appropriate for a collision between a recycled and non-recycled\nneutron star. This is much smaller than the gravitationallyinduced wobble angle and need not be considered further.\nHaving established that near collisions could excite free\nprecession we must now consider an event rate for such close\npassages. Of course, given that the event rate for encounters\nbetween a neutron star and a non-compact star was low, it is\nclear that the event rate for such close neutron star-neutron\nstar encounters will be extremely low. In fact it is straightforward to show that no such near-collisions will occur over\na Hubble time, using a simple model. Suppose there are N\nneutron stars in a globular cluster of size Rgc . Let v\u221e denote their average velocity when far apart. Then in a unit\ntime this population sweeps out an effective volume of order N Av\u221e , where A is a collision cross-section. Then the\nprobability of a given neutron star colliding with another in\nthis interval is of the order of this volume divided by the\n3\nglobular cluster volume, i.e. of order N Av\u221e /Rgc\n. As there\nare N such stars the probability of any one of them collid-\n\ning with any other is then N times this giving a collision\n3\nrate N 2 Av\u221e /Rgc\n. As there are approximately 200 globular\nclusters in the Galaxy we obtain a Galactic collision rate\n\u03bdcollision :\n\u03bdcollision \u2248 200\n\nN 2 Av\u221e\n.\n3\nRgc\n\n(100)\n\nIf gravitational attractions were neglected, the collision\ncross-section would be of order d2 \u223c (100 km)2 .

It is based upon a model commonly employed to describe the Earth's own motion. Explicitly, the neutron star\nhas been modelled as an elastic shell with a fluid core, whose\nangular amplitude of free precession (the wobble angle) is\nlimited by its finite crustal lattice strength. It has been\nknown for some time that neutron star structure may well allow detectable gravitational wave signals at Earth, but this\nis the first study to attempt to identify particular astrophysical scenarios in which such precessional motion might\nbe brought about and/or maintained.\nBroadly speaking, our findings were pessimistic. It\nproved impossible to find astrophysical pumping mechanisms capable of giving steady gravitational wave amplitudes detectable by an Advanced LIGO. This was because\nof the limiting effect of dissipation mechanisms internal to\nthe star, even when dissipation strengths several orders-ofmagnitude smaller than theoretically estimated values were\nassumed.\nTwo qualifications are in order. Firstly, the above conclusions were reached for stars with oblate deformations.\nIn the physically less likely case of a star with a prolate\ndeformation, the effect of internal dissipation would be to\nincrease the wobble angle. Such a situation is certainly interesting from the gravitational wave point of view, although\nthe dynamics of such a star, possibly involving crust cracking when the wobble angle exceeds a critical value, are far\nfrom clear. Secondly, most of the pumping mechanisms considered in this paper involved an externally generated torque\nbeing exerted on the star. There exists another possibility,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fGravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars\nwhere the symmetry axis of the deformation shifts due to a\nsmooth plastic deformation of the crust. For instance, this\ndeformation might be caused by accretion-induced temperature or composition asymmetries, in the manner described\nby Bildsten (1998) for non-precessing triaxial stars. These\ntwo possible modifications to our model are currently under\ninvestigation, to see if there may yet prove to be a way of\npowering a long-lived, freely precessing gravitational wave\nsource.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank Curt Cutler and Bernard Schutz for\nstimulating discussions during the course of this work.
