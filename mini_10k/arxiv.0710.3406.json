Observations of collimated outflows in young stellar objects indicate that several features of the jets can be understood by\nadopting the picture of a two-component outflow, wherein a central stellar component around the jet axis is surrounded by an extended\ndisk-wind.

In this context, the present article starts a systematic investigation of two-component jet models via time-dependent simulations\nof two prototypical and complementary analytical solutions, each closely related to the properties of stellar-outflows and disk-winds.\nThese models describe a meridionally and a radially self-similar exact solution of the steady-state, ideal hydromagnetic equations,\nrespectively.\nMethods.

Therefore, this work serves as the starting point\nfor the analysis of the two-component jet simulations.\nResults. It is found that radially self-similar solutions (disk-winds) always reach a final steady-state while maintaining all their welldefined properties. The different ways to replace the singular part of the solution around the symmetry axis, being a first approximation\ntowards a two-component outflow, lead to the appearance of a shock at the super-fast domain corresponding to the fast magnetosonic\nseparatrix surface. These conclusions hold true independently of the numerical modifications and/or evolutionary constraints that\nthe models have been undergone, such as starting with a sub-modified-fast initial solution or different types of heating/cooling assumptions. Furthermore, the final outcome of the simulations remains close enough to the initial analytical configurations showing\nthus, their topological stability. Conversely, the asymptotic configuration and the stability of meridionally self-similar models (stellarwinds) is related to the heating processes at the base of the wind. If the heating is modified by assuming a polytropic relation between\ndensity and pressure, a turbulent evolution is found. On the other hand, adiabatic conditions lead to the replacement of the outflow by\nan almost static atmosphere.\nKey words. ISM/Stars: jets and outflows \u2013 MHD \u2013 Stars: pre-main sequence, formation\n\n1. Introduction\nObservations made over the last two decades have shown that\none class of the widespread astrophysical phenomenon of collimated plasma outflows (jets) is being launched from the vicinity of most young stellar objects (YSOs) (Burrows et al. 1996).\nThese supersonic mass outflows are found to be correlated with\naccretion (Cabrit et al. 1990; Hartigan et al. 1995), to have narrow opening angles (Ray et al. 1996) and to propagate for several orders of magnitude of spatial distances ranging from the\nAU to the pc scales (Dougados et al. 2000; Hartigan et al. 2004).\nA central role in the launching, acceleration and collimation of\nthese jets is widely believed to be played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, which can also successfully remove the\nexcessive angular momentum, allowing in this way the YSO to\naccrete and enter the main sequence. Nevertheless, although recent high angular resolution observations put several constraints\nSend offprint requests to: Titos Matsakos,\ne-mail: matsakos@ph.unito.it\n\non the different driving mechanisms proposed, it is not yet clear\nwhich is the dominant plasma launching mechanism in YSO jets.\nThe system of a protostellar object basically contains two\ndynamical constituents, a central protostar and its surrounding\naccretion disk. Consequently, in Bogovalov & Tsinganos (2001)\nit is argued that jets observed from T Tauri stars most likely\nconsist of two main steady components: (i) an inner pressure\ndriven wind, which is non-collimated if the star is an inefficient\nmagnetic rotator and (ii) an outer magneto-centrifugally driven\ndisk-wind which provides most of the high mass loss rate observed. The relatively faster rotating magnetized disk produces\nthe self-collimated wind which then forces all enclosed outflow\nfrom the central source to be collimated as well. This conclusion\nis confirmed by self-consistent simulations of the MHD equations. More recently, in Ferreira et al. (2006) it is argued that\nfor the YSO jets observed in association with T Tauri stars, in\naddition to the pressure driven stellar outflow and the magnetocentrifugally launched extended \"warm\" disk-wind, a third component may be driven by magnetic processes at the magnetosphere/disk interaction, i.e., a sporadically ejected X-type wind.\n\n\f2\n\nMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\nIn addition, in Ferreira et al. (2000) a non steady \"two-flow\"\nscenario was also suggested, regarding a reconnection X- and a\ndisk-wind. Nevertheless, the existence of such sporadic components is not supported by observational data as being one of the\nmajor contributors to the steady characteristics of jets, but rather\ncould explain the observed variability in jet emission. On the\nother hand and within the same framework, recent observations\n(Edwards et al. 2006; Kwan et al. 2007) show that both, disk\nand stellar winds are mainly present in T Tauri stars, with the\ndominant component being determined by the intrinsic physical\nproperties of the particular YSO.\nFrom the analytical studies point of view, the complexity of\nthe launching and collimation mechanisms of jets have forced\nresearchers over the past several years to treat these two components separately. The only available analytical MHD models\nfor jets are those characterized by the symmetries of radial and\nmeridional self-similarity (Vlahakis & Tsinganos 1998). In the\nformer case, the solution is invariant as we look at a constant polar angle and in the latter, as we look at a constant spherical radius. The computational consequence of the respective symmetry is that by employing the separable spherical coordinates (r,\n\u03b8), the set of coupled MHD equations reduces to a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations in \u03b8, or, in r, respectively. The last remaining difficulty is to select solutions which are causally disconnected from the source of the outflow, i.e., those crossing the fast\nmagnetosonic separatrix. In this way, one may construct either\nradially self-similar solutions closely related to the properties\nof magneto-centrifugally driven disk-winds (Blandford & Payne\n1982; Contopoulos & Lovelace 1994; Ferreira 1997; Vlahakis et\nal. 2000, hereafter VTST00), or meridionally self-similar ones\nto address pressure driven stellar outflows (Sauty & Tsinganos\n1994; Trussoni et al. 1997; Sauty et al. 2002, hereafter STT02).\nSince each self-similar symmetry corresponds to a particular\ncomponent, we adopt the following initials: ADO (Analytical\nDisk Outflow) and ASO (Analytical Stellar Outflow) to refer to\nradially and meridionally self-similar solutions, respectively.\nApart from the geometry, an intrinsic distinction between\nthese two classes concerns the treatment of the energy equation.\nNevertheless, the symmetry difference makes them complementary to each other, since the ADO solution becomes singular at\nthe axis, whereas the ASO is by definition the proper one for\nmodeling the area close to it. In addition, the properties of the\nlaunching region of the disk-wind, i.e., at large polar angles, are\ndescribed more naturally by the ADO model. For a recent review\non the analytical work on MHD outflows the reader is referred\nto Tsinganos (2007).\nOn the other hand, the increase of computational power\nalong with the development of sophisticated numerical codes\nhave allowed to study the time evolution of the MHD equations,\ngiving us new perspectives of the physics involved. Jet launching\nand collimation have been mainly investigated with the following two methodologies: (i) by treating the disk as a boundary\n(Krasnopolsky et al. 1999; Ouyed et al. 2003; Fendt 2006) and\n(ii) by including the disk inside the computational box (Casse &\nKeppens 2004; Meliani et al. 2006; Zanni et al. 2007). The former case allows a wider range of physical processes and mechanisms to be studied, whereas the latter, has the advantage of the\njet evolution being consistent with that of the disk. However,\nwith the exception of Gracia et al. (2006; hereafter GVT06),\nmost numerical studies did not take advantage of the availability\nof the well studied analytical solutions which also allow a parametric study and therefore a better physical understanding of the\nproblem of jet launching and collimation.\n\nThe present work is the first attempt to numerically construct\nand study a two-component jet, by using as starting point the two\nwell studied classes of analytical self-similar solutions. Towards\nthis goal, in this paper we first address the question of the topological stability of each one of these two classes separately, before we combine them in the following paper.\nConcerning the ADO model, we shall use the VTST00 analytical solution, completing and considerably extending the\nGVT06 analysis. Therein, they found that the disk-wind model\nmay attain a new steady-state configuration close enough to the\ninitial analytical one, provided the assumption of some appropriate approximations around the axis. We further present the first\nnumerical studies of ASO (meridionally self-similar winds), referring to the solutions of STT02, that are essential to model the\nregion around the axis, just where the ADO model fails.\nOnce the physical properties and stability of these two\nclasses of solutions is clarified, our final aim will be to effectively build up a model that consistently merges the ASO and\nADO solutions. Such simulations will be presented in a future\nwork where we will study the launching and propagation of a\ncollimated stellar wind around the system axis surrounded by a\ndisk wind.\nFinally, a word on the term topological stability used in this\npaper. Classical stability theory addresses the question whether a\ngiven equilibrium configuration evolves away from (=unstable)\nor back to (=stable) the initial equilibrium when perturbed. In\nthe present context, topological (or structural) stability refers to\nthe question whether a given configuration preserves its topological properties when subject to various perturbations. Needless\nto say, that topologically unstable configurations may well be\nstable from the classical point of view and vice versa.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In section \u00a72 the formalism of the ADO and ASO solutions is briefly presented. In\nsection \u00a73 their implementation is explained and the numerical models to be investigated are presented. Section \u00a74 reports\nthe results obtained by carrying out the respective simulations.\nFinally in section \u00a75 we discuss our results in the framework of\nthe future matching and we report the conclusions of this work.\n\n2.

Finally, the index p corresponds to the poloidal components of the physical variables.\nBy assuming steady-state and axisymmetry, several conserved quantities exist along the fieldlines (Tsinganos\n1982). By\nR\n1\nintroducing the magnetic flux function A = ( 2\u03c0\n) B p * dS to label the iso-surfaces that enclose constant poloidal magnetic flux,\nthen these integrals take the following simple formulation:\n\u03a8A (A) =\n\n\u03a9(A) =\n\n\u03c1V p\n,\nBp\n\n!\n\u03a8 A B\u03c6\n1\nV\u03c6 \u2212\n,\n\u031f\n\u03c1\n\nL(A) = \u031f V\u03c6 \u2212\n\n!\nB\u03c6\n,\n\u03a8A\n\nHence, one obtains the following expressions for the physical\nvariables:\n\u03c1r = \u03c1r\u2217 \u03b1rx\u22123/2\n\n1\n,\nMr2\n\nPr = Pr\u2217 \u03b1rx\u22122\n\n1\n\n(6)\n\nV\u03c6;r = Vr\u2217 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121/4\nr\n\n(7)\n\nB p;r = \u2212Br\u2217 \u03b1rx/2\u22121\n\nB\u03c6\nV2\n\u0393 P\n,\n+\n+ \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a9\u031f\n2\n\u0393\u22121 \u03c1\n\u03a8A\n\n(8)\n\nQ(A) =\n\nP\n.\n\u03c1\u0393\n\n(9)\n\n(14)\n\nMr2\nsin \u03b8\n(cos \u03c8r \u031f\n\u02c6 + sin \u03c8r \u1e91) ,\nG2r cos(\u03c8r + \u03b8)\n\nV p;r = \u2212Vr\u2217 \u03b1\u22121/4\nr\n\nE(A) =\n\n(13)\n\n,\n\nMr2\u03b3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a8A is the mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio, \u03a9 the field angular\nvelocity,\nand L the total specific angular momentum.

Finally \u03bc is proportional to the gas\nentropy.\n\n2.1. ADO - The radially self-similar model\n\n2.2. ASO - The meridionally self-similar model\n\nWe employ the radially self-similar solution which is described\nin VTST00 and crosses successfully all three critical surfaces.\nWe note that a polytropic relation between the density and the\npressure is assumed, i.e. P = Q(A)\u03c1\u03b3 , with \u03b3 being the effective\npolytropic index. Equivalently, the source term in Eq. (3) has the\nspecial form\n\nWe employ a meridionally self-similar solution which corresponds to the case of a spherically symmetric thermal pressure\n(case \u03ba = 0, second sub-table of Table 1 in STT02, where \u03ba\nrepresents the deviations from such a pressure symmetry). This\nsolution is derived without the assumption of a polytropic relation, with the respective energy source term being consistently\nderived a posteriori. In this case the key functions are G\u03b8 (R),\nM\u03b8 (R), \u03a0\u03b8 (R) and F\u03b8 (R). The former two have the same interpretation as in the ADO model, while the latter ones are the pressure and the expansion factor, respectively.

Physical aspects and differences of the two solutions\n\nIn order to have a better understanding of these two classes of\nself-similar solutions, we pause here to point out a few aspects\nconcerning the main physical mechanisms involved in each case\nand their major intrinsic differences.\nThe ADO (radially self-similar) solution corresponds to a\nmagneto-centrifugally driven outflow with the \"bead on a rotating wire\" analogy. Fig. 7 of VTST00 displays the different\nterms of the conserved total energy as plotted along a particular\nfieldline as a function of z. It is evident, that close to the base of\nthe outflow, the electromagnetic energy dominates, whereas, as\nthe flow is being accelerated, the poloidal kinetic one becomes\neventually the main component of the total energy. The minor\nrole that the enthalpy seems to play is being investigated in \u00a74.\nFinally the reader is also referred to Fig. 5 of VTST00 where the\ncomponents of the outflow speeds are plotted.\nOn the contrary, the ASO (meridionally self-similar) solution\nadopted is a pressure driven outflow. Fig. 9 of STT02 presents\nthe forces acting along and across the streamlines for a solution\nvery similar to the one employed here. It can be clearly seen\nthat the pressure gradient is the dominant force for the acceleration of the flow while the collimation mechanisms are due to\nthe hoop stresses. Another important feature of the ASO model\nis that apart from the polar fieldlines leaving the stellar surface and closing to infinity, there are also those which cross the\nequator being asymptotically parallel to the axisymmetry axis.\nMoreover, a \"dead-zone\" also exists and is defined by the region of the fieldlines with both their footpoints rooted on the\nstar (Fig. 10 of Sauty & Tsinganos 1994). Furthermore, we note\nthat meridionally self-similar models are classified by an energetic criterion which characterizes the asymptotic shape of the\nstreamlines. In our case, the employed ASO corresponds to a\ncylindrical, magnetically collimated jet.\nA common feature concerning both classes, is the fact that\nthe poloidal critical surfaces do not coincide with the surfaces\nwhere the steady-state MHD equations change character from\n\nelliptic to hyperbolic and vice versa. This is because of the constraint put on the propagation of the MHD waves by the axisymmetry and the self-similarity assumption (Tsinganos et al. 1996).\nAs far as the two main intrinsic differences of the two models\nare concerned, we note the following. First, due to the assumptions of self-similarity, the ADO model has its MHD critical surfaces given for \u03b8cr = const, hence being of conical shape. On the\nother hand, they are spherical in the case of the ASO, as an outcome of the radial dependence of its key functions.\nThe second difference concerns the energy equation. In the\nADO solution, by assuming a polytropic relationship between\ndensity and pressure, the total energy-to-mass-flux-ratio is conserved. However, in the ASO, the momentum equation provides enough relations to close the system and the total energyto-mass-flux-ratio is not used. In both cases though, the heating/cooling mechanisms necessary to maintain the outflow can\nbe calculated a posteriori (see Eq. [10] and [30]).\n\n3. The numerical models\nWe will mainly focus on four topics sorted by increasing importance:\n1. to complete the GVT06 work by imposing the correct number of boundary conditions according to the number of waves\npropagating downstream;\n2. to further extend the GVT06 results by including the equator inside the computational domain and by investigating the\neffects of the singularity substitution, the resolution and the\nchoice of the minimum vertical distance of the lower boundary of the computational box, zmin ;\n3. to carry out and present the first time-dependent simulations\nof an ASO solution;\n4. to study how the energy input/output modifications influence\nthe features, stability and robustness of each model.\nThe analytical solutions provide the key functions, already\ndiscussed, along \u03b8 and R for the ADO and ASO models, respectively. Then, by properly interpolating in a cylindrical or a spherical grid the physical values are initialized with the help of Eqs.\n(12)-(18) and (20)-(28). More details on the treatment of the axis\nconcerning the ADO solution are given in section \u00a74.\nEqs. (1)-(4) are solved numerically using the MHD module\nprovided by the PLUTO code 2 (Mignone et al. 2007). PLUTO is\na modular Godunov-type code particularly oriented towards the\ntreatment of astrophysical flows in the presence of discontinuities. For the present case, second order accuracy is achieved using a Runge-Kutta scheme (for temporal integration) and piecewise linear reconstruction (in space). Although all the computations were carried out with the simple (and computationally\nefficient) Lax-Friedrichs solver, we point out that no significant\ndifferences were found by switching to more complex Riemann\nsolvers available in the code.\nTable 1 lists the numerical models constructed in order to\nstudy the previously mentioned aspects. Note that the ADO\nmodel is being investigated more extensively due to the singularity appearing at small polar angles. We define the reference\nlengths \u031f\u2217 and R\u2217 , of the ADO and the ASO models respectively, to be unity. In addition, the reference\nvelocities are nor\u221a\nmalized by setting Vr\u2217 = 1 and V\u03b8\u2217 = 2K/\u03bd in order for both\nsolutions to have the same gravitational\npotential.\np\np Time will be\n2 /K = \u03c0,\nexpressed in units of t\u2217 = 2\u03c0 \u031f3\u2217 /GM = 2\u03c0 \u031f2\u2217 Vr\u2217\n2\n\nPublicly available at http://plutocode.to.astro.it\n\n\fMatsakos et al.: I.

The final time of the simulations is obviously chosen to be greater than the one needed for a steady-state to be\nreached, if of course there exists one. Notice that all the following figures, apart from Figs. 6 and 16, correspond to the final state reached by the simulation at the final time indicated\nin Table 1. In order to prove the stability of the steady state\nwe have included a long term simulation to make the argument\nsolid. Finally, concerning the choice of our computational box,\nin many models we follow the guidelines of GVT06.\n3.1. The initial ADO model\n\nThe model parameters of this solution were chosen as x = 0.75\nand \u03b3 = 1.05, while the solution parameters are given to be \u03bb =\n11.70, \u03bc = 2.99, K = 2.00, in accordance to VTST00 3 .\nBy definition, radially self-similar models fail to provide\nphysically accepted solutions close to the axis, due to the local diverging behavior of the physical variables. The solution of\nVTST00 is terminated at \u03b8 < \u03b8min = 0.025(rad) \u2243 1.5\u25e6 , after\nhaving crossed the modified fast critical surface, also known as\nthe fast magnetosonic separatrix surface (FMSS) (Tsinganos et\nal. 1996). However, in GVT06 the rotational axis was included\nself-consistently inside the computational box by properly initializing the physical variables at these small polar angles. This\nwas achieved by assuming that the key functions G(\u03b8), M(\u03b8), and\n\u03c8(\u03b8) are all even, e.g. G(\u03b8) = G(\u2212\u03b8), and then by accordingly interpolating. The time evolution was performed with the numerical code NIRVANA. We have implemented this setup (model\n1DR) in PLUTO, although with a slightly different extrapolation\nscheme. Our proper smoothening of the flow quantities near the\n3\n\nThe solution adopted with the model parameter x = 0.75 corresponds to a zero ejection index \u03be according to Ferreira (1997). However,\nas it is evident from Figs. 5 and 6 of VTST00 the solution with\nx = 0.7575, i.e. \u03be = 0.0025, is almost identical to the one with x = 0.75\nfor z & 0.1. Therefore, we argue that the ADO solution employed here\nshould not contradict the theoretical arguments presented in Ferreira\n(1997).\n\nTotal time\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n6.0\n15.0\n4.0\n2.0\n10.0\n2.0\n220.0\n4.0\n40.0\n4.0\n600.0\n600.0\n80.0\n80.0\n\nDescription\nGVT06 (overspecified b.c.)

This\nis discussed in detail later on, where we apply and investigate\nthe effect of other extrapolation schemes as well. Finally, notice\nthat such a modification of the inner part of the wind, mimics the\npresence of an effective stellar outflow.\nObviously, such assumptions would not retain a divergencefree magnetic field in the central region, if Eq. (17) is used for its\ninitialization. So, instead, we initialize the poloidal component\nof the magnetic field by taking advantage of the flux function\n(12). Finally, in order to ensure consistency with the ideal MHD\nassumption, the radial velocity component is derived from the\nrelation:\nV\u031f = B\u031f\n\nVz\n.\nBz\n\n(31)\n\nwhere Vz is taken from Eq. (15).\n3.2. The initial ASO model\n\nThe adopted analytical solution has the model parameter \u03ba = 0,\nand corresponds to the following values of the solution parameters: \u03b4 = 0.01, \u03bb\u2032 = 3, \u03bd = 24.1, in accordance to STT02.\nIn this case, the values of the key functions are available\nfor 0.6R\u2217 \u2264 R \u2264 104 R\u2217 . However, note that this model varies\nsignificantly over all its radial scales and hence it is numerically complicated to resolve all regions with adequate accuracy.\nFor this reason, a number of simulations consider the superAlfv\u00e9nic domain only. On the other hand, exploiting the fact\nthat PLUTO can integrate in time over a uniform logarithmic\ngrid, the full range of the solution is also studied. Furthermore,\nthe energy source term, given by expression (30), is being taken\ninto account during the numerical evolution, unless otherwise indicated. Notice however, that the energy source term is not free\nto evolve in time, since it is provided by the key functions of\nthe analytical solution and hence it is kept fixed throughout the\nsimulations.\n\n\f6\n\nMatsakos et al.: I.

This defines the physical\nboundary conditions (Thompson 1987, 1990; Mignone 2005) as\nopposed to the information directed outside, which can be entirely determined by the solution inside the computational box.\nStill, since our numerical scheme requires the knowledge of all\n(eight) flow variables in the ghost zones, additional numerical\nboundary conditions are prescribed using suitable one-sided extrapolation formula. Furthermore, although the physical quantities evolved in the code are 8, i.e., \u03c1, P, B, V, axisymmetry along\nwith the \u2207 * B = 0 condition reduces the number of variables to\n7.\nNote that in GVT06, all the quantities were kept fixed at\nthe lower z boundary postponing the examination of this overspecification issue for a future study.\nIn this framework, when cylindrical coordinates are adopted,\nwe divide the lower boundary in 4 regions, i.e. a) Vz > V f ast;z , b)\nV f ast;z > Vz > VAl f v\u00e9n;z , c) VAl f v\u00e9n;z > Vz > V slow;z and d) Vz <\nV slow;z . In region a) we keep all seven quantities (V\u031f is always\ntaken from Eq. 31) fixed to their analytical values (since all 7\nwaves are directed inward), while the number of extrapolated\nvariables increases by one each time we cross a critical surface,\nbeing left with only 4 specified variables in d). In particular P,\nB\u031f , B\u03c6 are free to evolve in region d), while only P, B\u03c6 in region\nc) and finally only B\u03c6 in b). Note that, since the entropy wave is\nalways directed inside, at least four out of seven MHD waves are\nassociated with a physical boundary condition.\nAs far as the rest of the boundaries are concerned, we impose axisymmetry at the axis and outflow conditions at the top\nz boundary. Moreover, at the outer radial boundary, we apply\noutflow conditions for the ADO, whereas we keep the derivative of B\u03c6 constant for the simulations of the ASO solution. This\nis particularly important for the latter case where the jet shows\na high degree of collimation. As a result, a free condition for\nthe toroidal component of the magnetic field would cancel the\npoloidal current along the boundary. Hence, the Lorentz force\nwould be zero and the uncompensated hoop stress would create\nartificial collimation (as discussed in Zanni et al. 2007).\nOn the other hand, when spherical coordinates are adopted,\naxisymmetry holds at the axis and free conditions are imposed\nat the outer radial boundary. At the inner radial boundary and\nat \u03b8max , the correct number of conditions are specified, as previously mentioned. Of course, this is achieved according to the\nperpendicular velocities which now are VR and V\u03b8 , respectively.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. The Analytical Disk Outflow (ADO) solution\n4.1.1. Boundary conditions\n\nWe begin by presenting the results obtained by the correct specification of the boundary conditions, as discussed in section \u00a73.3\n(models 1DR, 2DB, 3DB).\nIn all cases the initial configurations are maintained and\nare almost identical: density contours and magnetic fieldlines\nare being plotted for model 3DB (same as model 2DB but in\nhigher resolution) in Fig. 1. The surfaces corresponding to the\nslow magnetosonic and slow magnetosonic separatrix surface,\nthe Alfv\u00e9n surface, and the fast magnetosonic surface of the final\nsteady state solution are perfectly coinciding with those of the\n\nFig. 1. Logarithmic density contours (black lines) and poloidal\nmagnetic fieldlines (white thin lines) are plotted for the final\nsteady-state reached for model 3DB. The critical surfaces of the\ninitial configuration are given by the plus signs; going counterclockwise we find the slow magnetosonic and slow magnetosonic separatrix (which practically coincide), the Alfv\u00e9n, the\nfast magnetosonic, and the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface\n(FMSS, close to the axis). For the final state, the same surfaces\n(apart from the FMSS) are indicated with the thick white lines.\nHowever, since the analytical equilibrium is preserved in that region, they can hardly be distinguished from those predicted by\nthe steady-state analysis. On the other hand, the FMSS of the final state is not conical any more but diverges from the axis (its\nposition is at the break of the magnetic fieldlines and at the discontinuity of the density). The dashed poloidal fieldline has been\nselected to compute the integrals of motion shown in Fig. 2.\n\ninitial analytical solution. This correspondence was also found\nin GVT06, but it was not so tight: this may be most likely ascribed to the different numerical codes used for the simulations.\nConversely, the numerically reshaped fast magnetosonic separatrix (FMSS) diverges from the analytical conical position, and,\nas will be discussed later, corresponds to a weak shock which\ncan be seen at the density jump and in the break of the poloidal\nfieldlines.\nIn Fig. 2, the integrals of motion (Eqs. [5]-[8]) are being\nshown for models 1DR and 2DB respectively, normalized to\ntheir outer boundary values. The fieldline along which they are\ncomputed, begins in a region where Vz < VAl f v\u00e9n;z while it\ncrosses the Alfv\u00e9nic and fast classical critical surfaces. This is\nparticularly important since a fieldline with its rooting point already in the super-Alfv\u00e9nic or the super-fast region would give\nmuch more similar and hence misleading results for the two\ncases. It is clear that the integrals of the final solution deviate\nby less than \u223c 1% when compared to the theoretically expected\none, with the exception of the entropy integral Q, which shows\na rather more sensitive behavior. Note an improvement on the\nconstancy of those integrals as compared to GVT06, where they\n\n\fMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\nFig. 2. The integrals of motion (Eqs. [5]-[8]), normalized to\nunity, are plotted along the poloidal magnetic fieldline (dashed\nline) indicated in Fig. 1 for the models 1DR (left) and 2DB\n(right).\n\nFig. 3. The density (left) and total pressure (thermal plus magnetic, right) jumps are being plotted for model 6DH along the\nperpendicular to the shock direction centered at the point x =\n5, y = 33 (indicated with the diamond in Fig. 4).\n\nwere found within . 15% of their analytical values, again with\nthe exception of Q.\nTherefore, Fig. 2 \u2013 along with the fact that both models 1DR\nand 2DB give identical final outcomes \u2013 suggests that the results obtained are not really sensitive to the number of boundary conditions imposed. The reason for this, is the fact that the\nsolution is topologically stable and remains close to the initial\none. Nevertheless, in order to be physically consistent, the correct number of boundary conditions has to be specified always.\n4.1.2. Shock at the FMSS\n\nWe now adopt the setup of 2DB and perform simulations by effectively increasing the resolution to examine both the behavior\nand nature of the density and pressure jump observed (models\n4DH, 5DH, 6DH).\n\n7\n\nFig. 4. The characteristics (thin solid lines) of the fast magnetosonic waves are plotted in a zoomed region around the shock\n(thick line) for model 5DH. The point indicated with a diamond\nis where the quantities of Fig. 3 are plotted. The dashed lines\nare (clockwise) the analytical FMSS, the fast poloidal critical\nsurface and the Alfv\u00e9nic one respectively.\n\nThe discontinuity manifesting in the simulations of the ADO\nmodels is identified as a weak shock. This conclusion is supported by taking into account the negative divergence of the velocity (thus denoting the compressional nature of the discontinuity), the jumps appearing on the density and pressure and the\nfact that the gradients steepen with the increase of the resolution. The density and the total pressure, thermal plus magnetic\n(P + B2 /2), are plotted across the shock in Fig. 3. Moreover, the\nstrength of the shock is found to decrease as we move far away\nfrom the base, whereas it becomes more and more oblique (see\nFig. 1). Consistent with the shock is the break of the poloidal\nfieldlines, as an effect of the amplification of the tangential component of the poloidal magnetic field. We remark also that the\njump in the entropy is very small, though, this is expected by the\nalmost isothermal conditions assumed for the wind (\u03b3 = 1.05).\nHowever, it has been validated (see discussion on solutions with\ndifferent polytropic indexes) that by increasing \u03b3 \u2192 \u0393 the entropy jump is increasing as well, as expected in adiabatic conditions.\nIn Fig. 4, selected fast magnetosonic characteristics are plotted. Note that the cones on the left of the shock do not ever\ncross it but become at best parallel to it. This proves that it corresponds to the numerically readjusted FMSS of the initial exact\nsolution. In particular, the model retains its property of a supermodified-fast solution, and thus a shock develops to preserve\nthe causal disconnection between the flows downstream and upstream. Because the cones constructed by the characteristics of\nthe fast waves in the final superfast region never cross the shock\nfront, it is not surprising that the sub-modified-fast region is not\naffected at all by the modifications taking place at small polar\nangles. In other words, the new FMSS behaves like a \"wall\" preventing the readjustments occurring by the extrapolation close\n\n\f8\n\nMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\nFig. 5. The poloidal currents (loci where \u031fB\u03c6 = const) of\nmodel 5DH are plotted. The arrows indicate the direction of the\npoloidal current density J p . A strong current sheet appears tangent to the shock. The dashed lines use the notation of Fig. 4\n\nFig. 6. Plot of the initial alfv\u00e9nic mach number, M, vs log(\u03b8) with\nthe three extrapolation schemes assumed for models I) 2DB, II)\n7DS and III) 8DS .\n\nto the axis and downstream of the analytical FMSS to affect the\nsolution upstream of the shock. Such a result is supported by\nall simulations carried out with the ADO models presented in\nTable 1.\nFurthermore, in Fig. 5 we plot the poloidal currents for\nmodel 5DH. They are counterclockwise upstream and far from\nthe FMSS, they change to clockwise very close and upstream\nof the FMSS, and finally they change back to counterclockwise\ndownstream of the FMSS. At the FMSS, where the azimuthal\nmagnetic field is discontinuous, we have a strong current sheet\nwith the surface current heading upwards being tangent to the\nshock. Thus, the currents seem to have a \"lightning\", or reverse\n\"N\" shape, with their middle part being parallel to the shock.\nThis distribution of the currents, and in particular the direction\nof the resulting J p \u00d7 B\u03c6 force, is consistent with the decollimation and deceleration that the flow experiences as it passes\nthrough the shock. Thus, one of the effects of the new FMSS is\nto bend the streamlines away from the z-axis avoiding the overcollimation property of the original analytical solution. The collimation and decollimation processes that can be derived from\nsuch a plot are also discussed in GVT06 (see Fig. 6 there).\n4.1.3. Smoothening the flow near the rotational axis\n\nWe now proceed to study how different types of extending the\nsolution up to the axis affect the final outcome of the simulation.\nWe adopt the following simple, but diverse enough, extrapolation schemes for the key functions which are shown in Fig. 6 as\nwell:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nI) (2DB) linear extrap. for \u03b8 < \u03b8min\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nII) (7DS ) flat extrap.\nfor \u03b8 < \u03b8min\nf (\u03b8) = \uf8f4\n(32)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 III) (8DS ) smooth extrap. for \u03b8FMS S < \u03b8 . 7.5\u25e6\n\nNotice that case I) is applied to all but 7DS and 8DS numerical\nmodels of the ADO solution presented in this paper.\n\nFig. 7. Logarithmic density contours and magnetic poloidal\nfieldlines for model 8DS (case III). The symbols are the same\nas in Fig. 1. The results for model 7DS (case II) are identical\nwith those of models 2DB the morphology of which can be seen\nin Fig. 1.\nFig. 7 displays the contours of the density for case III) after the simulation has reached a steady state, whereas cases I)\nand II) give identical results which can be seen in Fig. 1. These\nfirst two schemes, which involve modifications only for a small\npolar angle, display very similar features, despite their different\nextrapolation assumption. Case III) is of particular importance\n\n\fMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\n9\n\nby lowering and increasing zmin respectively, and we carry out\nsimulations in order to investigate this issue.\nFig. 9 shows the pressure contours of models 9Dz (left) and\n10Dz (right); the position of the shock is also evident. Note that\nin an iso-density contour plot, the shock would not be clearly\ndistinguished because the discontinuity appearing in model 9Dz\nis approximately aligned to the iso-density surfaces, as seen in\nFig. 1. Even though the classical critical surfaces of both cases\ndo not present any deviation from the initial model, the region\nwhere the shock front develops is considerably different. This\nresult can be understood by noting the following. The characteristics of the fast magnetosonic waves are directly related to\nthe formation of the shock. Therefore, the values of the physical\nvariables in the extrapolated region control its position. Recall\nthat these values are kept fixed since we are in the super-modified\nfast region. So, we speculate that the closer to the origin we set\nthe bottom boundary, the stronger these extrapolated values will\nbe affected by the steep gradients of the singular origin and the\nmore the characteristics defining the shock will deviate from the\nanalytical FMSS.\n\nFig. 8. The integrals of motion (Eqs. [5]-[8]) are plotted along \u031f\nat z = 50 for cases I) 2DB (left), II) 7DS (middle) and III) 8DS\n(right). The dashed line represents the initial setup whereas the\nsolid the final steady-state reached.\n\nsince the initial solution is sub-modified-fast, i.e. the whole domain is causally connected. However, the shock is still present\nin the final steady-state reached. Such a result suggests that even\nby starting from an analytical solution that does not cross the\nmodified-fast critical point, it will probably self-adapt to an \"astrophysically correct\" solution. With such a term, we mean that it\nwill be consistent with the causal disconnection \u2013 of the launching and termination regions \u2013 expected to exist in the jet phenomenon. This was somehow anticipated because, for the supermodified-fast extrapolation schemes of cases I) and II), the numerical FMSS is encountered before the analytical one along the\nflow.\nOn the other hand, these simulations demonstrate the stability and robustness of the analytical solution since the classical\npoloidal critical surfaces are not readjusted at all for any of these\ncases. We conclude that the final steady-state numerical solutions do not show any sensitivity neither on the extrapolation\nscheme nor to an initial sub-modified-fast solution as far as the\ncriticality condition and the upstream of the shock domain are\nconcerned.\nFinally, in order to argue that the extrapolation schemes\nadopted do not correspond to any physical inconsistencies, we\npresent in Fig. 8 the invariants (Eqs. [5]-[8]) along \u031f at z = 50\nfor each case for the initial and final states. Note that case I),\nwhich is applied in almost all simulations, is particularly interesting since the inner region is naturally substituted by a lower\n\u03a9 mimicking an outflow coming from a slower rotating star.\n4.1.4. Lower boundary\n\nWe now consider the influence of the choice of zmin to the final steady-state reached since the origin is a point where several\nvariables become singular. We construct models 9Dz and 10Dz,\n\n4.1.5. Extension to the equator and energetics\n\nWe proceed now to extend GVT06 down to the equator and\nsimultaneously examine the effect of different kinds of energy\ninput/output. To achieve the former we adopt spherical coordinates in order to naturally avoid the singularity at the origin,\nwhere all critical surfaces coincide. The simulations are performed in the grid with R \u2208 [10, 90] and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u01eb],\nutilizing R \u00d7 \u03b8 = [408 \u00d7 256] uniform zones, where \u01eb \u2243 1\u25e6 .\nWe effectively change the way the energy equation is treated by\nimplementing and evolving the following 3 setups: i) applying\n\u03b3 = 1.05 (11DE), i.e. according to the analytical solution, ii) assuming \u0393 = 5/3 (12DG) to examine the solution's behavior to\nan adiabatic evolution and iii) constraining the system under an\nisothermal condition (13DI).\nThe left panel of Fig. 10 gives the iso-density surfaces and\nthe shape of selected magnetic fieldlines of model 11DE. As expected, including the equator does not involve any new phenomena, since the analytical solution is well defined there. However,\nwe note that such a computational domain, along with the fixed\nboundary conditions imposed there, is a physically more consistent choice to describe the MHD outflow, justified by the geometric properties of the disk-star system. Finally, notice that\nthe position of the shock is consistent with the analysis we performed with the cylindrical coordinates, with the role played by\nzmin , being now by Rmin .\nOn the other hand, interesting results are displayed on the\nmiddle and right panels of Fig. 10, where selected fieldlines are\nplotted for the initial setup (solid) and the final numerical steadystate solution (dashed). The plots indicate that even though the\npolytropic relation is an unavoidable simplification to derive the\nexact solution of VTST00, it is found to contribute negligibly on\nthe final outcome reached by the numerical evolution. Besides,\nthis is not surprising since the necessary distribution of the pressure needed for constructing such solution is still the same for\nthese cases, with only the energetics during time evolution being\ndifferent. Such a pressure is crucial in order to force the Alfv\u00e9nic\ncritical surface to be close to the equator. For a thorough discussion see Ferreira & Casse (2004).\n\n\f10\n\nMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\nFig. 9. Contours of the logarithm of the pressure are being plotted for models 9Dz, i.e. z = 3 (left) and 10Dz, i.e. z = 12 (right). The\nvalues increases towards the axis from a minimum value of -4.0 to a maximum of 0.0, while the iso-baric lines differ by 0.1. The\ninitial and final poloidal critical surfaces are also indicated with the notation already mentioned in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 10. Logarithmic contours of the density (black lines) are being plotted for models 11DE (polytropic evolution, left), 12DG\n(adiabatic evolution, middle) and 13DI (isothermal evolution, right). The initial (solid) and final (dashed) fieldlines are sketched as\nwell (white lines).\n4.1.6. Long term evolution\n\nFinally, the structural stability argument has to be made concrete\nby evolving the solution for larger time scales. For that reason\nwe constructed model 14DT , a case identical to 2DB, but with\nits right edge further extended to avoid spurious reflections at the\nboundaries. Moreover, we choose a point in the upstream of the\nshock region, i.e. in the sub-modified-fast domain, and plot the\ndeviations of the density from its initial value as a function of\ntime.\nIt is evident from Fig. 11 that initially (t . 2) the submodified-fast solution is being perturbed due to the proper modifications at the axis. However, it converges quickly (t < 5) to\na constant value, roughly \u223c 1.5% different from its initial one.\nFor the rest of the simulation (5 < t < 220) the steady state is\nperfectly preserved proving its stability. Though, for t > 220,\n\nboundary effects of the imposed outflow conditions of the rightmost and upper boundary have propagated throughout the domain and start to artificially affect the solution. It is worth noting here that the Alfv\u00e9n velocity is of the order of unity at the\nlower central region of the computational box. Hence, the Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves have time to propagate many times before the simulation\nis brought to a halt.\n4.2. The Analytical Stellar Outflow (ASO) solution\n\nThe meridionally self-similar solution is in general less complicated to study, since it does not involve any separatrix in\nthe super-Alfv\u00e9nic region. Therefore, we will mainly investigate\nhere its topological stability and its response towards different\nrestrictions on the evolution of its energy equation. Notice that\n\n\fMatsakos et al.: I.

Logarithmic density contours (black lines) are sketched\nfor the final time of the simulation for the model 1S R which\ndoes not include a sub-Alfv\u00e9nic region. The magnetic fieldlines\nare drawn with white lines. The thick dashed one, is chosen to\nplot along the integrals of motion (Eqs. [5]-[8]; Fig. 14).\n\nIn Fig. 12 we plot the iso-density surfaces along with selected\nmagnetic fieldlines for a super-Alfv\u00e9nic wind (model 1S R). Note\nthat in this case we neither have the entropy integral nor the energy one, since for the former there is not any polytropic relation\nassumed, while for the latter, an explicit energy source term is\nparticipating. The initial setup is an exact solution throughout\nthe whole computational domain and hence the final time of the\nsimulation is arbitrarily chosen to be equivalent to the one selected for model 1S R. The stability of this class of solution can\nbe easily seen in Fig. 14 by the fact that the integrals of motion\ndeviate by only . 0.2%.\nThe solution stability has also been successfully validated\nthroughout all its radial range by adopting a logarithmic grid\nin the radial direction in spherical coordinates (models 2S L\nand 3S L). Note that model 3S L is particularly interesting since\nR \u2208 [0.7, 7.0] with R\u2217 = 1, which implies that both sub-Alfv\u00e9nic\nand super-Alfv\u00e9nic regions are consistently included inside the\ncomputational box. Fig. 13 gives the magnetic fieldlines of the\nfinal numerical solution which remains identical to the initial\nanalytical one. Therefore, the application of a logarithmic grid\nallows the approach of the stellar surface, and hence the fixed\nboundaries imposed are physically justified.\n4.2.2. Energetics\n\nmodels 1S R, 2S L and 3S L evolve in time with the analytically\nderived source term participating throughout the whole computational domain. For the rest of the ASO models investigated, the\ndetails are given in the following.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that one of the main questions\nposed by the mixing of the two self-similar solutions is on the\ntreatment of the energy equation. Although this will be discussed\nextensively in a companion work, we carry out simulations here\nto examine whether the ASO model can reach a steady-state\nwhen different energy input/output is included. We firstly ad-\n\n\f12\n\nMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\ndress the super-Alfv\u00e9nic outflow assuming, as in the previous\nADO solution, \u03b3 = 1.05 (model 4S P) or the adiabatic case\n\u0393 = 5/3 (model 5S G).\nThe outcome of the simulations is a quasi-steady-state that\nremains very close to the initial solution. With the term quasisteady, we imply the state when the timescale of the evolution of\nthe system is much larger as compared to the one of the initial\nmore intense readjustments. Especially at the first time steps,\nthe solution is strongly perturbed searching for a new equilibrium due to the different energy source terms imposed. Later on,\nafter the system relaxes, the outer radial regions are found to\nhave remained almost unmodified, whereas, close and along the\naxis the pressure has increased by roughly half an order of magnitude followed by a slight decrease of the density. This is not\nsurprising, since the analytical explicit energy source term, being taken into account in model 1S R, is of negative sign there,\ni.e. corresponds to energy loss. On the contrary, the polytropic\ncase corresponds to a positive input of energy while model 5S G\nto a zero heating/cooling. Hence, the pressure keeps increasing\nin both cases, due to the absence of the needed cooling, until it reaches a new numerical quasi-equilibrium configuration.\nThe quasi-steady-state reached can be judged by Fig. 14, where\nthe integrals of motion show deviations of . 3% after \u223c 100\nKeplerian rotations at the Alfv\u00e9n radius. This is an expected outcome considering that we are in the super-Alfv\u00e9nic region: we\nknow that the efficiency of the thermal driving of the flow is\nconcentrated very close to the base, where almost the whole acceleration occurs. This can be seen in Fig. 15 where we plot\nthe energy source term coming from the analytic solution (Eq.\n[30]). Up to four Alfv\u00e9n radii, the heating distribution decreases\nby \u223c 4 orders of magnitude thus proving its crucial role accelerating the outflow in the inner region. Afterwards, when the flow\nis propagating with its asymptotic speed, the energetics play a\nless important role.\nOne of the properties of these solutions are the oscillations\nof the fieldlines. The analytical results predict this possibility\nand we can argue that different energetic processes in the superAlfv\u00e9nic region amplifies these features.\nThe results are totally different if the same type of simulations, i.e. polytropic or adiabatic evolution, are performed with\nthe sub-Alfv\u00e9nic region included (models 6S L and 7S L): in this\ncase there is no steady-state reached. On the left of Fig. 16 a\nsnapshot of the turbulent evolution is displayed when the polytropic assumption with \u03b3 = 1.05 is applied. In fact, such a model\nis able to drive a sporadic low density outflow around the axis,\nas it can be seen by the velocity vectors.\nConversely, an adiabatic evolution, Fig. 16 on the right,\nforces the system to collapse towards the star, asymptotically approaching a static atmosphere. This is because the ASO model is\nthermally driven and when we impose an adiabatic equation of\nstate we effectively switch off all the heating needed to drive the\noutflow. As expected, the energy processes at the base of meridionally self-similar winds are crucial for their evolution.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper we have studied several physical and numerical aspects concerning two classes of the self-similar models, each\nassociated with a disk- and a stellar-wind, in the framework\nof the upcoming work that combines them to describe a twocomponent outflow. These analytical solutions (ADO and ASO)\nwere appropriately modified, implemented as initial conditions\nand evolved in time. Our main conclusions are the following:\n\nFig. 15. The logarithm of the absolute value of the heating distribution is being plotted (model 3S L). The thick white line indicates the surface after which the energy input changes sign and\nbecomes cooling. Note that in the inner region, the heating distribution gradually decreases by \u223c 4 orders of magnitude, while\nin the outer one by only half.\n\n\u2013 The Analytical Disk Outflow (radially self-similar) solution\nhas been successfully validated for its stability and robustness against several physical and numerical issues. This argument holds true even though the analytical solution was in\nmany cases significantly modified. We have constructed numerical models and carried out simulations a) by assuming\nthe extreme cases of an isothermal and an adiabatic evolution, b) by treating the diverging behavior of the solution at\nthe axis with different kinds of extrapolation schemes, mimicking a stellar wind component and c) by changing the size,\nresolution and geometry of the computational box.\nIn all cases, the poloidal critical surfaces, with the exception of the FMSS, were not readjusted, but rather matched\nperfectly to their initial position. The numerical solution always maintained the property of the successful crossing of\nall three critical surfaces producing an outflow causally disconnected from the base. This is achieved with the formation of a shock, corresponding to the numerically readjusted\nFMSS. In particular, this shock acts as a \"wall\" protecting the\nsub-modified-fast magnetosonic regions (source regions of\nthe disk wind) from any perturbations taking place due to the\nmodification of the models close to the axis (e.g. an effective\nstellar wind). However, the numerically readjusted FMSS\n(shock) does not coincide with the analytical one, with this\ndeparture being dictated by the respective numerical modifications of the models under consideration. A highly significant result is the fact that such a conclusion holds true\neven if we initialize the simulation with a sub-modified-fast\nsolution, i.e. a solution with its whole domain causally connected. We found that, during the simulation, such a numerical model self-adapts to produce a shock (corresponding to\nthe FMSS), hence no information of the downstream region\n\n\fMatsakos et al.: I.

This implies\nthat even MHD outflow solutions, that do not successfully\ncross all three critical points, will probably converge to \"astrophysically correct\" solutions once evolved in time (see\nalso Ferreira 1997).\nOn the other hand, the study of GVT06 was successfully extended down to the equator with the help of simulations using spherical coordinates. Furthermore, by adopting different\nassumptions for the energy source terms, it was shown that\nthe solution is only slightly and accordingly self-modified\nmaintaining all its well defined properties. This is in agreement with the fact that the ADO solution describes essentially a magneto-centrifugally accelerated outflow.\n\u2013 The Analytical Stellar Outflow (meridionally self-similar)\nsolution, which was validated in time-dependent simulations\nfor the first time, maintained its well-defined equilibrium as\n\nexpected. Such conclusion is supported by simulations performed with both the super- and sub-Alfv\u00e9nic regions included. Quite critical are, contrary to disk winds, the effects\nof the energetics in such thermally driven models. Although\ndifferent assumptions of the energy equation in the superAlfv\u00e9nic domain did not yield any significant modification\nof the analytical solution, strong variations of the structure of the axial outflows are found if modifications of the\nheating/cooling mechanisms occur in the initial accelerating region. In particular a polytropic assumption, mimicking\nisothermal conditions, would produce a turbulent weak outflow, while an adiabatic evolution asymptotically reaches a\nstatic atmosphere. We are tempted to relate the heating intermittency and even a switching off in such an ASO solution\nwith the observed variability of accretion-driven YSO outflows.\n\n\f14\n\nMatsakos et al.: I. Topological stability of the self-similar solutions\n\n\u2013 All previous statements hold true while being in perfect\nagreement with physically consistent requirements, such as\nspecifying the correct type of boundary conditions: a) according to the propagation direction of the MHD waves, b)\nthe axisymmetry holding around the axis and c) the constancy of certain physical variables at both a conical surface\nclose to the equatorial plane and a radial one close to the\norigin, implying the presence of an underlying disk and the\nstellar surface, respectively. Therefore, the results can safely\nbe trusted since they are not subject to any artificial forcing.\n\u2013 Last, but certainly not least, is the fact that almost all models of both classes reached a steady- or quasi-steady-state. In\nthis context, the upcoming mixing of the two complementary classes of self-similar solutions in order to study a twocomponent jet is well founded and promising. The final numerical model will incorporate both proposed scenarios of a\npressure-driven outflow (ASO) surrounded by an extended,\nmagneto-centrifugally driven disk wind (ADO). This task is\nundertaken in the second paper of this series.\nAcknowledgements.
