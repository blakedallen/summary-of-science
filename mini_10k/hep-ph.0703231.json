Introduction\nTheories beyond the standard model which include several new particles at the TeV scale and\na new discrete symmetry lead to cascade decays with interesting signatures at colliders. At the\nsame time, the discrete symmetry reduces the contributions of new particles to electroweak\nobservables, allowing the new particles to be light enough such that they can be copiously\nproduced not only at the LHC, but perhaps even at the Tevatron. Classic examples of such\ntheories include supersymmetric models with R-parity, universal extra dimensions [1], and\nLittle Higgs models with T -parity [2]. Typically, the cascade decays in these models lead to\nobservable events with up to four leptons and missing transverse energy [3, 4].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fIn this paper we show that more spectacular events, with five or six leptons, or one\nphoton and several leptons, are predicted in the 6-dimensional standard model (6DSM). This\nmodel [5], in which all standard model particles propagate in two universal extra dimensions\ncompactified on the chiral square [6, 7, 8], is motivated by the prediction based on anomaly\ncancellations that the number of fermion generations is a multiple of three [9], and by the\nlong proton lifetime enforced by a remnant of 6D Lorentz symmetry [10].\nThe larger number of leptons and the presence of photons is due to the existence of\n'spinless adjoint' particles, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of gauge bosons polarized along\nextra dimensions. Compared to five-dimensional (5D) models where such fields become the\nlongitudinal components of the KK vector bosons, in six-dimensional (6D) gauge theories\nthere is an additional field for each KK vector boson, which represents a physical spin-0\nparticle transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group [5].\nThe 6DSM has a KK parity corresponding to reflections with respect to the center of the\nchiral square. Its consequences are similar to the ones in the case of a single universal extra\ndimension [11], where KK parity is the symmetry under reflections with respect to the center\nof the compact dimension. It is well known that in the 5D case KK parity ensures the stability\nof the lightest KK particle (LKP). Furthermore, loop corrections select the KK mode of the\nhypercharge boson to be the LKP [12], and that is a viable dark matter candidate [13]. The\nsame is true in the 6DSM, with the additional twist that the LKP in that case is a spinless\nadjoint. In fact, one-loop mass corrections in this model lift the degeneracy of the modes at\neach KK level, making all spinless adjoints lighter than the corresponding vector bosons [14].\nParticles on the first KK level, having KK numbers (1,0), are odd under KK parity. As\na result, they may be produced only in pairs at colliders, and each of their cascade decays\nproduces an LKP, which is seen as missing transverse energy in the detector. The goal of\nthis paper is to determine the main signatures of (1,0) particles at hadron colliders. Particles\non the second level, which have KK numbers (1,1) and are even under KK parity, lead to a\ncompletely different set of signatures, mainly involving resonances of top and bottom quarks\n[5].\nWe review the 6DSM in Section 2, and then proceed in Section 3 to calculate decay widths\nfor (1, 0) modes. We analyze the production of these particles at the LHC and Tevatron in\nSection 4, and compute rates for events with leptons and photons. Several comments regarding\nour results are given in Section 5. Feynman rules for this model are given in Appendix A.\nDetails of the calculations of one-loop 2-body and tree-level 3-body decay widths for spinless\nadjoints and vector bosons can be found in Appendices B and C, respectively.\n\n2. Two universal extra dimensions\nWe assume that all standard model fields propagate in two flat extra dimensions, of coordinates x4 and x5 , compactified on a square of side L = \u03c0R with adjacent sides identified\nin pairs (see Figure 1). This compactification predicts that the fermion zero modes are chi-\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fx5\n\nSides are\nidentified\n11\n00\nL00\n11\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\nL\n\nL\n\nx4\n11\n00\nSides are 00\n11\n0\nidentified\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\nL\n\nx4\n\nx5\n0\n(1)\n\nFigure 1: Chiral square compactification (left) and level-1 KK function f0 (x4 , x5 ) for standard\nmodel fields (right).\n\nral, and therefore may represent the observed quarks and leptons. Furthermore, this 'chiral\nsquare' is invariant under rotations by \u03c0 about its center. The ensuing Z2 symmetry, known\nas KK parity, implies that the lightest KK-odd particle is stable.\nEquality of the Lagrangian densities on adjacent sides of the square is achieved by enforcing that bulk fields and their first derivatives vary smoothly across the boundary. Applying\nthese boundary conditions to solve the 6D equations of motion for these fields, by separation\nof variables, we find that the dependence on x4 and x5 can be expressed in terms of one\n(j,k)\nof four complete and orthonormal sets of functions fn\nwith n = 0, 1, 2, 3, where the KK\nnumbers\np (j, k) are integers and j \u2265 1, k \u2265 0 or j = k = 0. All (j, k) modes have tree-level\nmass j 2 + k2 /R before electroweak symmetry breaking.\n2.1 Interactions of the (1,0) modes\nWe are primarily interested in the phenomenology of the (1, 0) modes here. We loosely refer\nto these as 'level-1' modes because they are the lightest nonzero KK modes. For notational\nbrevity we will label them using the superscript (1).\nThe level-1 KK modes belonging to a tower that includes a zero mode has a KK function\n\u0010x \u0011\n\u0010x \u0011\n(1)\n5\n4\n+ cos\n,\n(2.1)\nf0 (x4 , x5 ) = cos\nR\nR\nwhich is plotted in Figure 1. This is the case for the KK modes of all spin-1 fields and\nfermions of the same chirality as the observed quarks and leptons, as well as the Higgs doublet.\n(1)\nThe spinless adjoint field, AH , which is the uneaten combination of the extra-dimensional\npolarizations of the 6D gauge field, is associated with a KK function which is independent of\nx4 ,\ni\n1 h (1)\nx5\n(1)\n(1)\nfH = \u2212 f1 (x4 , x5 ) \u2212 f3 (x4 , x5 ) = \u2212 sin\n,\n(2.2)\n2\nR\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fwhile the longitudinal component of the vector KK modes is associated with a KK function\nwhich is independent of x5 :\n(1)\n\nfG = \u2212\n\ni\nx4\ni h (1)\n(1)\nf1 (x4 , x5 ) + f3 (x4 , x5 ) = sin\n.\n2\nR\n\n(2.3)\n\nKK modes of fermions come in vectorlike pairs with the component of 4D chirality opposite\nto the corresponding standard model fermion having KK function f1 or f3 , depending on the\n6D chirality.\nIntegrating over the extra dimensional coordinates gives the 4D effective Lagrangian,\nwhich contains kinetic and interaction terms for all SM particles and their KK modes. We\nlimit ourselves to detailing in this section only the couplings of the standard model fields with\nthe level-1 KK modes; the latter are odd under KK parity and so only appear in pairs. The\ngeneral Lagrangian for all modes is derived in Ref. [6, 7], while the couplings for all fermion\nmodes can be found in Appendix B.\nThe SU (3)c gauge interactions include the following tree-level couplings between zero\nmodes and (1, 0) modes:\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\n(1)a \u03bc (1)b c\n(1)b \u03bc \u03bdc\n\u2202 \u03bc G\u03bd(1)b \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd G\u03bc(1)b G(1)c\n\u2212 G(1)a\nLgauge \u2283 gs f abc G(1)a\n\u03bc G\u03bd \u2202 G + GH \u2202 GH G\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n+\n\ni\n\u0011\ngs2 h abd ace (1)b \u03bc(1)c d \u03bde \u0010 abc ade\n\u03bcd (1)c \u03bde\nG\nG\nG\nf f G\u03bc G\nG\u03bd G + f f\n+ f adc f abe G(1)b\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n2\ngs2 abc ade (1)c (1)e b \u03bcd\nf f GH GH G\u03bc G ,\n2\n\n(2.4)\n(1)\n\nwhere gs is the QCD gauge coupling, f abc are the SU (3)c structure constants, and G\u03bc\n(1)\nand GH are the level-1 vector and spinless adjoint KK modes of the gluon G\u03bc . We have\nsuppressed all superscripts for zero modes. There are also interactions of the quark modes\nwith the QCD vector and spinless modes:\n(1)\n(1)\nLmatter \u2283\ngs Q\u00b1 Ga\u03bc T a \u03b3 \u03bc Q\u00b1\nfermions\n\nX\n\n+\n\n\u0014\n\n(1)\na \u03bc\ngs Q\u00b1 G(1)a\n\u03bc T \u03b3 P L Q\u00b1\nR\n\n(1) (1)a\n\u2212 iQ\u00b1 GH T a PL Q\u00b1\nR\n\n\u0015\n\n+ H.c. ,\n\n(2.5)\nwhere fermions with 6D chirality + contain left-handed zero modes, and fermions with 6D\nchirality \u2212 contain right-handed zero modes. The SU (2)W and U (1)Y sectors are analogous,\nwith all the gauge self-couplings set to zero in the Abelian case. The Higgs and ghost terms\nare given in Ref. [6, 7].\n\n2.2 Mass corrections\nComputing radiative corrections in this theory involves taking sums over KK modes, or\nmomenta in the extra dimensions, which fourier transform to operators localized at the corners\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fof the chiral square, (0, 0), (\u03c0R, \u03c0R) and (0, \u03c0R) \u223c (\u03c0R, 0).

Note that KK parity ensures the equality of\nthe operators localized at (0, 0) and (L, L). Local operators break 6D Lorentz invariance and\nhence give rise to mass corrections for KK particles. Such terms are important for models of\nflat extra dimensions since they allow for the decays of higher modes into pairs of lower ones,\na process which would otherwise be on threshold at best due to the quantization of KK mode\nmasses. They also make for a more interesting phenomenology by lifting the degeneracy of\nstates at each level.\nThe localized terms contain contributions from ultraviolet physics as well as from running down from the cut-off. Being unable to compute the former, we assume that they are\ngenerically smaller than the logarithmically-enhanced one-loop terms which are calculable\n(for further discussion see [14, 12]).

The (1,0) Higgs particles are not included\nhere because their masses are quadratically sensitive to the cutoff scale. The right-hand panel shows\nthe spectrum for 1/R = 0.5 TeV.\n\nwhile only the spinless adjoints in the electroweak sector have mass corrections:\n\u03b4MG(1) = 0\nH\n\n\u03b4MW (1) = \u2212\n\nm2 R\n51 2 l0\ng\n+ W ,\n8 R\n2\n\n\u03b4MB (1) = \u2212\n\n307 \u20322 l0\ng\n.\n8\nR\n\nH\n\nH\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe above mass shifts include negative contributions from fermions in loops, allowing for\noverall negative corrections to masses. This is especially important when there are no selfinteractions to compete with the fermion interactions, as is the case with for the hypercharge\nbosons.\nThe masses of the (1,0) particles are given in Table 1 in units of 1/R. The mass shifts\nare evaluated there for gauge couplings gs = 1.16, g = 0.65 and g\u2032 = 0.36, which are the\nvalues obtained using the standard model one-loop running up to the scale 1/R = 500 GeV,\nWe will use the masses from Table 1 throughout the paper, ignoring further running of the\ngauge couplings above 500 GeV (note that the standard model running of the gauge couplings\nbetween 500 GeV and 1 TeV results in only a 3% change in gs and negligible changes in g and\ng\u2032 ; however, above \u223c 1/R the running is accelerated by the presence of the level-1 modes).\nThe KK modes of the Higgs doublet have mass-squared shifts which are quadratically\nsensitive to the cutoff scale \u039b [12]. Hence, the masses of the (1,0) Higgs scalars may be treated\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fas free parameters (determined by the underlying theory above \u039b, which is not specified in\nour framework). Furthermore, additional structures such as the Twin Higgs mechanism [15]\nmay be used to cancel the quadratic divergences in models with universal extra dimensions\n[16], potentially affecting the (1,0) Higgs sector. We assume here that the (1,0) Higgs particles\nare heavier than 1/R. In that case, the hadron collider phenomenology is mostly independent\nof the exact (1,0) Higgs masses.\n2.3 Loop-induced bosonic operators\nIn addition to lifting the degeneracy of the (1, 0) masses, loop corrections also contribute to the\nfollowing dimension-5 operators that are of particular interest for computing the branching\nfractions of the (1, 0) bosons:\n\u2212\n\n\u0011\nR\u0010\n(1) (1)\n(1) (1)\nCB \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03bc\u03bd B\u03b1\u03b2 BH + CG \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 G\u03bc\u03bd B\u03b1\u03b2 GH ,\n4\n\n(2.11)\n(1)\n\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd and G\u03bc\u03bd are the field strengths of the photon and gluon, respectively, B\u03b1\u03b2 is the\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nfield strength of the (1, 0) hypercharge vector boson B\u03b1 , and BH is the U (1)Y spinless\nadjoint. These operators account for the only significant 2-body decay channels open to the\n(1)\n(1)\nlevel-1 KK modes GH and B\u03bc . The analogous operator with the photon replaced by the Z\nboson is less relevant because the corresponding decay width is phase-space suppressed. The\ncoefficients of the above dimension-5 operators are computed in Appendix B, with the result:\nCB =\n\nX \u0010 YF \u0011 2\n1\ng\u20322 e\nQ F EF ,\n\u03c3F\n8\u03c0 2 R M 2 (1) \u2212 M 2 (1)\n2\nB\u03bd\n\nBH\n\n(2.12)\n\nF\n\nwhere \u03c3F = \u00b11 for a 6D fermion F of chirality \u00b1, QF is the electric charge, YF is the\nhypercharge normalized to be twice the electric charge for SU (2)W singlets and EF is a\n(1)\n(1)\nfunction of the masses of BH , B\u03bd , and of the (1,0) and (1,1) fermions given in Eq. (B.10).\nCG is given by an analogous expression, but it is suppressed by the small mass difference\nbetween the initial- and final-state (1, 0) bosons.\nOne might also naively expect higher-dimension operators of the form\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\u2212\n(1)3\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n+ \u03bc (1) \u03bd\n(2.13)\n\u2202 BH \u2202 WH + H.c. ,\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc BH \u2202 \u03bd GH + Z\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc BH \u2202 \u03bd WH + W\u03bc\u03bd\n(1)\n\nto be generated, where WH is the level-1 SU (2)W spinless adjoint and W\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd are\nthe standard model field strengths for the W and Z bosons. However, the first of these\nterms is identically zero as can be seen after integrating by parts and using the gluon field\nequation. By the same method one can see that the coefficients of the last two terms are\n(1)\nsmall, being proportional to (mW R)2 , and furthermore the resulting decay widths for WH\nare also phase-space suppressed.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f3. Decays of the level-1 particles\nKK parity allows any (1,0) particle to decay only into a lighter (1,0) particle and one or more\nstandard model particles. The lightest (1,0) particle is stable. In this section we compute the\nbranching fractions of the (1,0) particles assuming that the generic features of the 'one-loop'\nmass spectrum, shown in Table 1, are not modified by higher-order corrections.\n3.1 Color-singlet (1, 0) particles\n(1)\n\nThe WH boson (the spinless adjoint of SU (2)W ) is the next-to-lightest (1,0) particle, and\n(1)\ntherefore can decay only into a BH plus standard model particles. The dominant decay\n(1)\n(1)3\nmode of its electrically neutral component is the 3-body decay WH \u2192 BH l \u0304l, where l are\nleptons. The width for this decay, computed in Appendix C, is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b12 MW (1)\n(1) + \u2212\n(1)3\nH\n=\nI+ MW (1) , MB (1) , ML(1) ,\n\u0393 W H \u2192 BH e e\n(3.1)\n+\nH\nH\n128\u03c0 cos2 \u03b8w sin2 \u03b8w\nand is the same for any lepton pair. The dimensionless function I+ contains phase space\nintegrals for the decay and is defined in Eq. (C.8). Expanding this to leading order in the\nmass difference MW (1) \u2212 MB (1) , which is accurate to about 25% for the mass spectrum in\nH\n\nH\n\n(1)\n\n(1)3\n\nTable 1 [see Eq. (C.18) in Appendix C], we find that the width of the WH decay into BH\n(1)\nplus quarks has a simple expression in terms of the decay width into BH plus leptons:\n\uf8f64\n\uf8eb 2\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 1 ML(1) \u2212 MW (1)\n\u0010\n(1) + \u2212\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)3\nH \uf8f8\n,\n(3.2)\ne\ne\n\u2192\nB\n\u0393\nW\n\u0393 WH \u2192 BH qq \u2248 \uf8ed 2 +\nH\nH\n3 M (1) \u2212 M 2 (1)\nQ+\n\nWH\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have not summed over quark flavors.

For the same reasons, the B\u03bc decay into a BH and qq pairs has a\n(1)\n(1)\nsmall decay width. B\u03bc decays to WH plus fermion pairs are highly suppressed due to the\ndependence on the 7th power of the small difference between initial and final (1,0) masses\n[see Eqs. (C.12) and (C.18) in Appendix C].\n(1)\nBesides these tree-level 3-body decays, B\u03bc also has 2-body decays via the dimension-5\noperator shown in Eq.

Signatures of (1,0) particles at hadron colliders\nIn this section we discuss the prospects for discovery of (1,0) particles at the LHC and the\nTevatron. As shown in the previous section, a large number of leptons arises in the decays\n(1)\n(1)\nof W\u03bc and other (1,0) bosons, while photons arise in the decay of the B\u03bc vector boson.\nWe focus on computing the production cross sections of colored particles and the number\nof events with leptons and photons resulting from their decays. We will also include direct\n(1)\nproduction of W\u03bc in our analysis although this turns out to have a rather small effect.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f4.1 Pair production of level-1 particles\nWe discuss the production of (1,0) particles in order of importance for the lepton + photon\nsignals under consideration. This is more complicated than level-1 production in the case of\n(1)\none universal extra dimension [17] because of the GH spinless adjoint, which is not present\nin the 5D theory, and appears in the final state as well as in s- and t- channel exchanges.\n(1)\nWe begin with the SU (2)W -doublet quark Q+ , because a large fraction of its cascade\ndecays gives rise to charged leptons (see Section 3). In addition, since it is lighter than the\n(1)\n(1,0) vector gluon, and because of its high multiplicity, we expect Q+ production to be the\ndominant source of multi-lepton signals. We concentrate here on production mechanisms at\nthe LHC, while in section 4.3 we adapt this discussion to the case of pp\u0304 collisions at the\nTevatron.\nGiven that there are more quarks than anti-quarks involved in proton-proton collisions,\n(1)\n(1) (1)\nwe first discuss quark-initiated pair production, qq \u2192 Q\u00b1 Q\u00b1 , which is mediated by G\u03bc\n(1)\nand GH exchange in the t channel, as shown in Fig. 3. Two (1,0) quarks of different flavors\n(1) (1)\n(1) (1)\n(Q\u00b1 Q\u2032 \u00b1 ), and an SU (2)W doublet-singlet pair (Q+ Q\u2032 \u2212 ) are produced in a similar way.\nFor low 1/R, the quark anti-quark and gluon initiated production mechanisms are also\n(1) (1)\n(1) (1)\nimportant. Production from a quark anti-quark pair, q q\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 Q\u00b1 Q\u0304\u2032 \u00b1 and q q\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 Q\u00b1 Q\u0304\u2032 \u2213 ,\nis similar to the process shown in Fig. 3 with a fermion line replaced by an anti-fermion line.\nWhen quarks in the initial state have a different flavor than the (1,0) quarks in the final\n(1) (1)\nstate, q \u2032 q\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 Q\u00b1 Q\u0304\u00b1 , a single tree-level diagram with a gluon exchange in the s channel\n(1) (1)\ncontributes, as shown in Fig. 4.

Consequently it is rather straightforward to compute production cross sections for (1,0) particles at various colliders. As a\ncross-check we have compared the CalcHEP output for all 2- and 3-body decay widths with\nthe corresponding analytic expressions in Section 3. We also checked cross sections for selected\nproduction channels using MadGraph/MadEvent [21, 22].\n\u221a\nThe cross sections at the LHC ( s = 14 TeV) are graphed as a function of 1/R in Fig. 10,\nand have been summed over various channels.

We use\nthe CTEQ6L parton distributions [23], and choose the scale of the strong coupling constant\n\u03b1s to be equal to the parton-level center of mass energy.\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nQ+ Q+ production, which is responsible for most of the multi-lepton events (as shown\nlater in Section 4.2), is dominated by (1,0) quarks of the first 2 generations (88% at 1/R = 500\nGeV, increasing to 98% at 1/R = 1 TeV). The gluon-gluon initial state contributes only \u223c10%\n(1) (1)\n(3%) of the total Q+ Q+ cross section at 1/R = 500 GeV (1 TeV), since firstly the gluon flux\nin the proton at this mass scale is small, and secondly, there is a large number of subprocesses\n(1)\nwith qq or q q\u0304 initial states. GH production is different in that the dominant contribution to\nthis process comes from the gluon initial state, with valence quarks making up the remainder.\n(1)\n\nThe production cross sections of the SU (2)W doublet and singlet (1,0) quarks, Q+\n(1)\n\nor Q\u2212 , are almost equal, since they are produced in exactly the same way (see Figs. 3(1)\n6). The slightly higher mass of Q+ lowers its production cross section, but this is a small\n(1)\neffect. As expected from the structure of the parton distribution function, the G\u03bc associated\nproduction cross sections drop off faster than others.\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nQ+ U\u2212 pair production, the main source of events containing both photons and leptons,\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nproceeds through G\u03bc and GH exchange in the t-channel, as in Fig. 3 with one of the Q+\n(1)\nquarks replaced by U\u2212 . Due to the partonic structure, the production with first-generation\n(1) (1)\nquarks in the initial state are dominant, accounting for \u223c 50% of all Q+ U\u2212 pairs produced\nfor 1/R = 500 GeV.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\f(1)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, W\u03bc associated production, although small compared to that for\ncolored (1,0) particles, is not necessarily negligible because of its large branching fraction into\nleptons. We have included the cross section for the channel with the largest production rate,\n(1)+ (1)\nW\u03bc Q+ , in Fig. 10. The dominant contribution to this process is from production with\n(1)\u2212\n\nfirst generation (1,0) quarks. W\u03bc\nassociated production is even smaller, by an extra factor\nof \u223c3, due to the partonic structure of the proton.\n4.2 Events with leptons and photons at the LHC\nHaving determined the production rates of (1,0) particles, we now turn to a discussion of their\nexperimental signatures at the LHC. First we will consider the production of (1,0) particles\nwhich give nl + m\u03b3 + E\n/ T with n \u2265 nmin and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2, where we do not count leptons from\nthe decay of the standard model particles.\nWe calculate the inclusive cross sections for the channels nl + m\u03b3 + E\n/ T with n \u2265 nmin\nand 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2 in the following way. There are 11 (1,0) particles with different branching\n(1)\nfractions to multiple leptons as discussed in Section 3. We label these particles by Ai , where\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 11 is the particle type:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(4.1)\nAi = W\u03bc(1) , G\u03bc(1) , GH , T+ , B+ , T\u2212 , U\u2212 , D\u2212 , Q+ .\n\nTheir branching fractions, Br(i, a, a\u2032 ), where a is the number of leptons (0 \u2264 a \u2264 4) and a\u2032\n(1)\n(1)\nis the number of photons (0 \u2264 a\u2032 \u2264 1), are given in Section 3. Q+ and U\u2212 include only\nthe first two generations of weak doublets and up-type singlets. One should keep in mind\nthat the 3rd generation KK quarks and KK quarks of the first two generations have different\nbranching fractions to leptons so they need to be tackled separately. For simplicity we use\nthe same symbol here for quarks and antiquarks. The cross section for nl + m\u03b3 + E\n/ T events\nwith n \u2265 nmin and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2 is\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 nl + m\u03b3 + E\n/ T , n \u2265 nmin ) =\n\n11 X\n11\nX\ni=1 j\u2265i\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 Ai Aj )Bij ,\n(1)\n\nwhere Bij is a sum over products of branching fractions of the particles Ai\nBij =\n\n4\nX\n\n1\nX\n\nBr(i, a, a\u2032 )Br(j, b, b\u2032 ) ,\n\n(4.2)\n(1)\n\nand Aj\n\n(4.3)\n\na,b=0 a\u2032 ,b\u2032 =0\na+b\u2265nmin a\u2032 +b\u2032 =m\n\nNote that the total numbers of photons (m) and leptons (n) from the decay of a pair of (1,0)\nparticles are constrained by 0 \u2264 n + 2m \u2264 8. It is not possible to obtain 8l + 2\u03b3 + E\n/T\n(1)\nfor instance, since the hypercharge gauge boson B\u03bc can decay into either a photon or a\n(1)\nfermion pair, together with BH , so a photon is only produced at the expense of two leptons.\nMost (1,0) particles have branching fractions that are independent of 1/R. However, those\nfor third generation quarks have variations due to threshold effects (see Fig. 2). We use\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 11: Sum over cross sections for (1,0) particle pair production at the LHC times the branching\nfractions of the cascade decays that give rise to n \u2265 3, 4, 5 or 6 charged leptons (l = e\u00b1 or \u03bc\u00b1 ), as a\nfunction of the compactification scale.\n\nvalues at large 1/R, which slightly underestimates the total number of events as branching\nfractions are larger at small 1/R. Since the contribution from the third generation is small,\nour approximation gives rise to negligible error.\nCross sections for multi-lepton events at the LHC are shown in Fig. 11 as a function\nof 1/R. Out of the total number of events with 5 leptons or more at 1/R = 500 GeV, the\nmajority arise from first- and second- generation weak doublet quarks, either in pairs or in\n(1)\nassociation with other particles; W\u03bc pair production is responsible for around 10%, as is\n(1)\nproduction including SU (3)c bosons, G\u03bc,H . As parton distribution functions vary with the\nsize of the extra dimensions, so will the individual contributions, although the sensitivity to\nthe mass scale 1/R is small. The results shown in Fig. 11 include tree-level processes only.\nWe estimate that next-to-leading order effects will increase the cross sections by \u223c30-50%,\nespecially due to initial state radiation. A complete analysis of this effect is warranted, but\nis beyond the scope of this paper.\nAlso interesting are combined photon and lepton events which result from 1-loop decays\n(1)\n(1)\nof the (1) hypercharge gauge boson B\u03bc produced in the decay chain of U\u2212 quarks (see\nFig. 12(a)). Down-type quarks have smaller hypercharge and so couple less strongly; while\nquark doublets couple more strongly to weak bosons, resulting in a negligible branching\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 12: Cross sections for (a) m\u03b3 + nl + E\n/ T events with n \u2265 nmin for m = 1, 2 and 1 \u2264 nmin \u2264 4\nand (b) Lepton + photon events with two or more same-sign leptons, at the LHC as a function of\n1/R.\n(1)\n\nfraction into B\u03bc . In Fig. 13 we show typical diagrams for l+ l+ l+ l\u2212 l\u2212 and \u03b3l+ l\u2212 signatures.\nThe rate for events with unusual combinations of final states: two same-sign leptons and\na photon, \u03b3l+ l+ (\u03b3l\u2212 l\u2212 ) for instance, or three same-sign and one opposite sign lepton,\nl+ l+ l+ l\u2212 (l\u2212 l\u2212 l\u2212 l+ ), are plotted in Fig. 12(b). The latter process consists of around 10%\nof the total rate for 4 lepton events, and the largest single contribution to it is the decay\n(1)\n(1)\nof U+ (D+ ) pairs. It arises only rarely in the standard model from W + W + Z (W \u2212 W \u2212 Z)\nproduction.\nWe expect that the small standard model backgrounds for these processes can be eliminated by using a hard E\n/ T cut in conjunction with a jet pT cut since the jets originating\nfrom the decay of (1,0) colored particles should have a transverse momentum of the order\nof their mass differences (\u223c 100 GeV). One might also naively worry about triggering issues\ndue to the softness of leptons, since the cascade decays giving rise to them occur between\nparticles that are relatively degenerate in mass. A preliminary analysis on a single leg of the\ndecay chain keeping exact spin correlations suggests that more than 90 % of lepton pairs have\nq\u2032\ng\n(1)\n\nQ+\n\n\u03bd\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nWH\n\nQ\u0304+\n\nl\u0304\nq\u0304\n\nl\n\n(1)\n\nQ+\n\nq\n\nl\n\nW\u03bc(1)3\n\n(1)\nBH\n\n(1)\nGH\n\nq\n\nl\n\n(1)\nN+\n\nl\u0304\n\nBH\n\n(1)3\n\ng\n\n(1)3\n\nWH\n\nW\u03bc(1)+\n\ng\n\nq\n\nl\u0304\n\n(1)\nL+\n\n(1)+\nWH\n\n\u03bd\nl\u0304\n(1)\n\n\u03bd\u0304\n\nBH\n\u03b3\n\nB\u03bc(1)\n\n(1)\n\nBH\n\n(1)\n\nQ\u2212\n\nq\n+ \u2212\n\nFigure 13: Representative processes that lead to 5l + E\n/ T and \u03b3l l + E\n/ T events.

Hence we do not anticipate any triggering problems, although a\ndetailed analysis of these issues using a detector simulator might be beneficial.\n4.3 Cross sections at the Tevatron\nAt the Tevatron, the production from a q q\u0304 initial state, shown in Figs. 4, 7 and 9, dominates.\nWe summarize our results for (1,0) production cross sections, as well as multi-lepton and\nlepton plus photon signatures in Fig. 14. The lower center-of-mass energy of this collider\n(1)\nslightly increases W\u03bc production cross sections as compared with the LHC. This process\nnow contributes 16% of the total number of events with 4 or more leptons for 1/R = 300\nGeV.\nWe can use data gathered from Tevatron Run II to place rough constraints on the radius\nof the extra dimensions. One potential channel that has been searched for in the context of\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model is the trilepton signal [24, 25]. We apply the\nresults of this analysis, which found no excess over standard model background, directly to\nour model. If we assume an efficiency of \u223c 5% [24, 25], we see that 1/R must be larger than\n\u223c 270 GeV, otherwise we might have expected to observe at least 3 events. Low statistics\nfor this final state, both in expected and observed events, make the limit rather less reliable\nthan desired.\nA more precise, though less stringent, constraint can be obtained by using Run II lepton\n+ photon data [26], which contains larger numbers of expected and observed events. The\nstandard model prediction for the l\u03b3X channel for instance, is 150.6 \u00b1 13 with an observation\nof 163 events. Assuming that universal extra dimensions are responsible for the small excesses\nin this and the l+ l\u2212 \u03b3X channels allows us to obtain a limit on 1/R of around 240 GeV at\n95% C.L.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f5. Conclusions\nDespite the successful predictions of the 6DSM, the hadron collider phenomenology of (1,0)\nKK modes has not been previously studied due to the large number of mechanisms that\ncontribute to production cross sections. Our inclusion in CalcHEP of the interactions between\n(1,0) particles and standard model ones has allowed us to compute the cross sections for (1,0)\npair production at the LHC and the Tevatron. The large cross sections (of almost 104 fb\nat the LHC, for masses around 500 GeV) shows that cascade decays with small branching\nfractions may be observed, leading to a variety of discovery channels. These are particularly\ninteresting because of the presence in the 4D effective theory of a spinless adjoint particle for\neach standard model gauge group. One-loop corrections to the level-1 masses tend to make\nthese spinless adjoints lighter than matter fields [14] (the same result [27] applies to other\nmodels [28]), forcing them to undergo tree-level 3-body decays and emitting two standard\nmodel fermions each time. This results in significant numbers of events with five or more\nleptons.\nMulti-lepton events are not unique to the 6DSM, although the rates at which they occur\nin other theories are typically smaller. In its 5D counterpart for example, it is necessary to\nproduce level-2 KK particles to give rise to long enough cascades; the rate for such processes is\nsuppressed because the particles produced are heavier (m \u223c 2/R) [4]. Another theory leading\nto multi-lepton signatures involves a warped extra dimension with custodial symmetry [29],\nbut leptons in that case come from decays of W and Z, whose branching fractions are small.\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 0\nIn supersymmetric models, cascade decays of squarks such as q\u0303L\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n2 q \u2192 W \u03c7\u03032 q(\u03c7\u03031 Zq)\ncan also give multi-lepton signatures at the cost of small production cross sections due to\nspin-statistics as well as a small branching fraction for q\u0303L\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n2 q.\nNevertheless, it should be rather straightforward to differentiate among these models if\na sufficiently large number of multi-lepton events will be observed at the LHC. The 6DSM\nhas specific preditions for many observables. In this paper we analyzed the rates for events\nwith 3, 4, 5 and 6 leptons, as well as the relative rates for events with three leptons of one\ncharge and one lepton of opposite charge. Other observables, such as the relative rates for\nevents with different numbers of electrons and muons, may be analyzed using the branching\nfractions for complete cascade decays (see the tables in Section 3). Another peculiarity of the\n6DSM cascade decays is that they lead with reasonably large branching fractions to events\nwith photons. This is a consequence of the 2-body decay at one loop of the hypercharge (1,0)\nvector boson, which competes successfully with its tree-level 3-body decays. Events with\nleptons, photons and missing energy are also predicted in certain supersymmetric extensions\nof the standard model, but again, there are several different channels, and we expect that if\nsuch events will be seen in large numbers, it will be possible to differentiate between models.\nOne may wonder how robust our predictions are against variations in the mass spectrum,\nwhich may get contributions from operators localized at the fixed points of the chiral square,\nas well as from higher-order QCD effects. In the case of a single universal extra dimension,\ndeviations from the one-loop corrected mass spectrum lead to a variety of phenomenological\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fimplications [30]. Within the 6DSM, we expect that the rates for multi-lepton events remain\nrelatively large when the (1,0) mass spectrum is perturbed. This is due to the large number\nof particles involved in a typical decay chain, with a standard model quark or lepton being\nemitted at each stage. The total rates computed here are sums over many such cascade decays\nof several (1,0) particles. However, the events with photons depend entirely on the branching\nfractions of a single particle, the hypercharge vector boson, and thus are less generic for\ndifferent mass spectra.\nA more general approach would be to lift the constraints on the mass spectrum. If excess\nevents with leptons, missing energy and possibly photons will be observed in certain channels\nat the LHC, then the (1,0) masses would be determined by comparing a large set of observed\nrates with the 6DSM predictions. One should also keep in mind that the predictions of the\n6DSM are not limited to collider signals. For example, an interesting feature is that the LKP\nhas spin 0, with various implications for dark matter [31].\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Hsin-Chia Cheng, Konstantin Matchev\nand Eduardo Ponton for helpful conversations.

Furthermore, the\nintegration over Ef \u0304 cancels the leading term in the \u03bc\u25e6 expansion of the numerator of I\u00b1 .\nThe resulting dependence on the 7th power of \u03bc\u25e6 implies that the decay width is extremely\nsuppressed, if A2 and A1 are more degenerate than the F \u2212 A2 pair.\nThe decay widths given in Eqs. (C.7) and (C.15) are used in Section 3 for computing the\nbranching fractions of the spinless adjoints, while the decay width of Eqs. (C.12) determines\nthe branching fractions of the (1,0) hypercharge vector boson.\n\nReferences\n[1] T. Appelquist, H. C. Cheng and B. A. Dobrescu, \"Bounds on universal extra dimensions,\"\nPhys.
