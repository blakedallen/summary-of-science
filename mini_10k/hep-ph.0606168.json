INTRODUCTION\nQuantum Chromodynamics is made special among phenomenologically relevant field theories by the property of\nconfinement. Given that the lagrangian is written in terms of fields that do not appear in the construction of the\ntrue asymptotic states of the theory, it may seem surprising that perturbative calculations performed around the\ntrivial vacuum have any relevance at all. The predictive power of perturbative QCD, in the presence of a kinematic\nscale Q2 much larger than the confinement scale \u039b2 , is rescued by asymptotic freedom, combined with quantummechanical incoherence and gauge invariance. These are the necessary ingredients entering the proof of factorization\ntheorems [1], which are the cornerstones of all PQCD calculations.\nFactorization theorems in essence provide a bound for the parametric size of nonperturbative corrections to high\nenergy inclusive cross sections. Such corrections are typically suppressed by powers of the hard scale Q2 . It should\nbe emphasized, however, that factorization theorems are proven perturbatively, by examining the all-order structure of long-distance singularities in Feynman diagrams. Their phenomenological relevance must then rely upon the\nadditional (if plausible) assumption that confinement be a relatively soft process, happening without a violent rearrengement of momentum configurations, as colored particles evolve away from the hard scattering event. Decades of\nexperience with QCD phenomenology have taught us that this assumption is very well borne out by the data. Indeed,\ngranted this assumption, the bound on the size of nonperturbative effects provided by the factorization theorem is\nthe first and simplest case of nonperturbative information extracted form QCD by purely perturbative methods.\nThe general idea that perturbation theory, whenever genuine all-order information is available, can provide important clues to understand nonperturbative effects, has subsequently been applied successfully in a variety of situations.\nTypically, the perturbative expansion is found to diverge, and the uncertainty in the physical prediction due to this\ndivergence is interpreted as a measure of the size of the expected nonperturbative correction. Specifically, the nonperturbative contribution must be ambiguous by an amount matching the uncertainty in the perturbative prediction.\nThe assumption that the actual size of the nonperturbative corrections should be well represented by this ambiguity\nis sometimes referred to as ultraviolet dominance of power corrections [2].\nThe all-order perturbative information required to begin any study of power corrections has mostly been provided by\ntwo complementary sources: renormalon-type calculations (reviewed in [3]), which roughly speaking target runningcoupling effects by summing up fermion bubble corrections to single gluon emission, and soft gluon resummations,\nwhich make use factorization and universality to compute leading multigluon contributions in the soft and collinear\nlimits (for a recent review, see [4]). Recently, it was shown that the two appoaches can be combined [5], yielding a\nstrongly constrained and rather elegant model of power corrections in the Sudakov region.\nEvent shape distributions in hard collisions are an especially interesting class of observables for power correction\nstudies, and indeed a lot work has been done in the past several years on the subject, especially in the context of e+ e\u2212\nannihilation and DIS [6, 7]. Event shape distributions, in fact, provide a continuous interpolation between processes\nT005\n\n1\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nfeaturing mostly hard, perturbative radiation and configurations dominated by soft and collinear gluon emission.\nThe corresponding theoretical prediction must then be constructed matching a variety of tools: NLO perturbative\nresults for hard emissions, soft gluon resummations when the value of the event shape forces radiation to be soft,\nand finally models of power corrections very close to threshold.\nIn general, models of power corrections involve nonperturbative parameters or functions, which must be determined\nfrom experiment, much as one does with parton distributions. The predictive power of these models must then rely\non a degree of universality of soft radiation, which is well understood in perturbation theory, and must be assumend\nto hold nonperturbatively as well. By comparing theoretical predictions for different but related event shapes one\ncan then test our understanding of QCD at or beyond the strict limits of applicability of perturbation theory.\nThe application of these techniques has lead in recent years to quantitatively testable and quite successful models\nof power corrections. Here I will mostly discuss results obtained by Dressed Gluon Exponentiation (DGE) [5], as\napplied to thrust [8, 9], the C-parameter [10], and the class of angularities [11, 12]. These examples show that\ncurrent tools lead to simple, analytical, quantitative results that can readily be compared with experimental data.\nMost strikingly, leading power corrections to angularity distributions obey a simple scaling rule as a function of a\ncontinuous parameter, which gives a powerful test of our understanding of soft QCD in electron-positron annihilation.\nIn Sect. (2) I will briefly summarize the formalism of shape functions for event shape distributions, and show how\nDGE provides a renormalon model for shape functions incorporating the constraints of NLL soft gluon resummation.\nI will use mostly thrust as a working example, comparing at the end with similar results obtained for the C parameter.\nIn Sect. (3) I will discuss the class of angularities and derive the scaling rule, and finally in Sect. (4) I will briefly\ncomment on possible extensions of these techniques to hadron-hadron collisions.\n\n2. SOFT GLUON EFFECTS FOR EVENT SHAPE DISTRIBUTIONS\nAn event shape distribution is a weighted cross section, assigning a prescribed value to a specific infrared and\ncollinear safe combination of the momenta of final state particles in a high energy collision. In the case of e+ e\u2212\nannihilation, let Fm (p1 , . . . , pm ) be one such combination, computed for an m-parton final state. The distribution of\nthe associated event shape f is then\nZ\n1 X\nd\u03c3\n2\n(1)\n=\ndLIPSm |Mm | \u03b4 (f \u2212 Fm (p1 , . . . , pm )) ,\ndf\n2Q2 m\nwhere Mm is the appropriate matrix element. In the following, I will consider event shapes f which vanish in the\nlimit of a pencil-like two-jet event. A prime and well-known example is \u03c4 = 1 \u2212 T , with T the thrust,\n\u0014P\n\u0015\npi * n\u0302|\ni |~\nT = max\n,\n(2)\nn\u0302\nQ\nwhich I will use below to illustrate the general features of the approach. Other shapes I will consider include the\nC-parameter,\nC =3\u2212\n\n(pi * pj )2\n3X\n,\n2 i,j (pi * Q) (pj * Q)\n\n(3)\n\nwhich does not require a maximization procedure, and the one-parameter class of angularities,\n\u03c4a =\n\n1 X\n(p\u22a5 )i e\u2212|\u03b7i |(1\u2212a) .\nQ i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere rapidity \u03b7i and transverse momentum p\u22a5,i are computed with respect to the thrust axis, so that for a = 0 one\nverifies that \u03c40 = \u03c4 .\nThe common feature of these event shapes, which opens the way to an all-order perturbative analysis and to studies\nof power corrections, is the fact that for small values of f all radiation is constrained to be soft or collinear. As a\nT005\n\n2\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nconsequence, the distributions develop double logarithmic singularities of Sudakov type, which can (and must) be\nresummed thanks to the universal properties of soft radiation and to the factorizability of the cross section in the\nSudakov limit. In QCD, resummation displays the ambiguity of perturbation theory, originating from the presence\nof the running coupling evaluated at soft scales. This leads naturally to models of power corrections. I will now\nillustrate the general features of the method using thrust as an example.\n\n2.1. Resummation\nIn order to resum singular contributions to the thrust distribution in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, one needs to take a\nLaplace transform, which factorizes the \u03b4-function constraint fixing the value of \u03c4 . Logarithmic contributions then\nexponentiate according to\n!#\n\"Z\nZ uQ2 2\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndq\ndu \u2212u\u03bd\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03bd\u03c4 1 d\u03c3\n.\n(5)\n+2\nA \u03b1s (q )\n= exp\ne\n\u2212 1 B \u03b1s uQ\nd \u03c4e\n2\n\u03c3 d\u03c4\nu2 Q2 q\n0 u\n0\nThe pattern of exponentiation is highly nontrivial, since the double logarithms of the ordinary perturbative expansion\nturn into single logarithms in the exponent. Generically one finds a structure of the form [13]\nX\n\n\u03b1ks\n\nk\n\n2k\nX\np\n\nh\ni\nckp Lp \u2192 exp L g1 (\u03b1s L) + g2 (\u03b1s L) + \u03b1s g3 (\u03b1s L) + . . . ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere L is the logarithm of the transformed variable, L = log \u03bd in this case. Leading logarithms (LL) are generated\nto all orders by the function g1 , which is completely determined by the knowledge of the anomalous dimension\nA(\u03b1s ) to one loop. Next-to-leading logarithms (NLL), corresponding to the function g2 , require the knowledge of\nA(\u03b1s ) to two loops and B(\u03b1s ) to one loop. NLL accuracy is the common standard for resummation of event shape\ndistributions. Note however that Sudakov resummation, expressed here by Eq. (5), in general involves one more\n\u0001\nfunction, D \u03b1s (u2 Q2 ) . This function is associated with wide-angle soft gluon emission, and is process-dependent,\nunlike the anomalous dimension A. To any finite logarithmic accuracy, the contributions of D can be reproduced by\nmodifying B in a process-dependent manner, and for the event shapes discussed here D does not give any contribution\nat NLL level. The fact that D dpends on the scale uQ, however, has important consequences on power corrections,\nas discussed below.\n\n2.2. Power Corrections\nOne can deduce from Eq. (5) (where the integration variable u in the exponent plays the role of \u03c4 ) that for small\nvalues of \u03c4 there are two relevant momentum scales: \u03c4 Q2 and \u03c4 2 Q2 . This can be understood from the physical\npicture underlying Sudakov factorization: at small \u03c4 gluon radiation can be organized into jets of particles collinear\n\u221a\nto the primary partons, with invariant mass proportional to \u03c4 Q, plus the contribution of wide-angle soft gluons,\ncharacterized by their total energy \u03c4 Q. It is natural to expect that power corrections will be organized by these\ntwo scales, and thus be of the form (\u039b2 /(\u03c4 Q2 ))m and (\u039b2 /(\u03c4 2 Q2 ))n respectively. Clearly, when \u03c4 \u223c \u039b/Q all power\ncorrections of this second kind become important, and must be collectively taken into account. Power corrections in\nthe larger scale, on the other hand, become important only when \u03c4 \u223c \u039b2 /Q2 , a value which is too small to be relevant\nfor LEP fits. The need for power corrections is apparent in Eq. (5), since the integrals over momentum scales are\nperturbatively ill-defined because of the Landau singularity of the running coupling. An elegant way to summarize\nthe nonperturbative information encoded in Eq. (5) was described in [14]. The basic assumptions are the applicability\nof the factorization underlying Eq. (5) all the way down to values of \u03c4 such that \u039b2 \u223c \u03c4 2 Q2 \u226a \u03c4 Q2 \u226a Q2 , and the\nexistence of a nonperturbative definition of the running coupling rendering the scale integrals well defined. Consider\nthen, for example, the term in Eq. (5) containing the anomalous dimension A. In order to disentangle perturbative\nT005\n\n3\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nand nonperturbative domains, one can simply introduce a factorization scale \u03bc, switch the order of the q 2 and u\nintegrations, and define\nS(\u03bd, Q ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nSNP (\u03bd/Q, \u03bc) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03bc2\n\nuQ2\n\n\u0001\ndq 2\nA \u03b1s (q 2 ) = SNP (\u03bd/Q, \u03bc) SPT (\u03bd, Q, \u03bc) ,\n2\nu2 Q2 q\n\u0012 \u0013n\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\n\u221e\n2\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001 q/Q du \u2212u\u03bd\n1 \u03bd\n\u03bd\ndq\n2\n2\n.\ne\n\u22121 =\nA \u03b1s (q )\n\u03bbn (\u03bc ) + O\n2\nq\nn!

In general, the full set of leading nonperturbative corrections will involve also moments of the function D,\nwhich also parametrize power corrections of the form (\u039b\u03bd/Q)n . These corrections thus have a universal component,\nexpressed in terms of the anomalous dimension A, and a process-dependent component given by the function D. At\npower accuracy, it is natural to disentangle the contributions of B and D by requiring that the function B should\nbe the same appearing in the resummation formula for DIS structure functions, where the corresponding D function\nis known to vanish [15]. Expressions like Eq. (7) provide a framework to test universality, or to construct specific\nmodels of power corrections. To summarize the effects of the parameters \u03bbn (\u03bc2 ) one can use them to build up a\n\"shape function\", according to\nZ \u221e\nh\ni\nexp SNP (\u03bd/Q, \u03bc) \u2261\nd\u01eb e\u2212\u03bd\u01eb/Q f\u03c4,NP (\u01eb, \u03bc) .\n(9)\n0\n\nHere \u01eb can be interpreted as the total energy carried into the final state by soft gluons at scales below \u03bc. Confining\noneself to the leading power correction, corresponding to the first moment \u03bb1 (\u03bc2 ), one recovers the result of the\n\"tube model\" [16]: that nonperturbative effects shift the distribution away from the small \u03c4 region by an amount\nproportional to the average energy carried away by soft radiation. Subleading moments provide additional smearing.\n\n2.3. Dressed gluon exponentiation\nThe shape function idea is very general, and can be used both to test universality, by connecting power corrections\nto related event shapes [17], or to construct models based on factorization and Lorentz invariance in specific cases [18].\nOne can get more detailed predictions by making stronger assumptions: for example, one can apply a renormalon\nmodel, and study the corresponding power corrections in the Sudakov region. This is the basic idea underlying\ndressed gluon exponentiation (DGE) [5]. I will now summarize the basic steps of this method, using thrust as an\nexample.\nFirst of all, one computes the single gluon contribution to the event shape under study, for a gluon of nonvanishing\nvirtuality \u03be = k 2 /Q2 . This is the characteristic function of the dispersive approach [19, 20] to power corrections.\nSince we are interested in the Sudakov region, we need to retain only terms that are singular as \u03c4 \u2192 0. Given the\ncharacteristic function F (\u03be, \u03c4 ), one can write a clean representation of the single gluon cross section by introducing\na Borel representation for the strong coupling. One defines\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\u2212u sin \u03c0u \u03bau\n2\ne .\n(10)\n\u0100(\u03beQ ) =\ndu \u03be \u2212u Q2 /\u039b2\n\u03c0u\n0\nThis amounts to an analytic continuation of the strong coupling at the scale k 2 from the euclidean to the timelike\nregion, formally valid in the large-nf limit. The factor e\u03bau is renormalization-scheme dependent, with \u03ba = 5/3 in the\nT005\n\n4\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nM S scheme. The single dressed gluon cross section is then\nZ 1\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\u2212u\nCF\nCF\ndF (\u03be, \u03c4 )\n1 d\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u0100(\u03beQ ) \u2261\n(\u03c4, Q ) = \u2212\nd\u03be\ndu Q2 /\u039b2\nB(\u03c4, u) ,\n\u03c3 d\u03c4\n2\u03b20 0\nd\u03be\n2\u03b20 0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere in the last equality I introduced the Borel function B(\u03c4, u), which contains the physical information on the\nthrust distribution. The strategy of performing all integrals except the one over the Borel parameter yields at the\nend a trasparent representation for power corrections. In the case of thrust, the terms responsible for logarithmic\nenhancements in \u1e1e (\u03be, \u03c4 ) are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u03be2\n\u03be\n\u1e1e (\u03be, \u03c4 )\n=2\n(12)\n\u2212 2 \u2212 3 ,\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nlog\nwhich gives a Borel function of the form\nB(\u03c4, u)|log = 2 e\u03bau\n\nsin \u03c0u\n\u03c0u\n\n\u0014\n\n2 \u22121\u22122u\n\u03c4\n\u2212 \u03c4 \u22121\u2212u\nu\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n1\n1\n+\n+\nu 1\u2212u 2\u2212u\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nNote that already at this stage one can make several useful observations. Poles in B(\u03c4, u) at, say, u = u0 , would\ncorrespond to renormalon singularities in the distribution, and expected power corrections of size (\u039b/Q)2u0 ; in fact,\nB(\u03c4, u) has no such poles: the would-be singularities at u = 1, 2 are cancelled by the factor sin \u03c0u, and poles at u = 0\ncancel between the two terms in square brackets, because of the infrared safety of thrust. Renormalons arise when\ntaking moments of the distribution, because of the convergence constraints on the Borel integral at small values of\n\u03c4 . One also notes that the first term in Eq. (13) is associated with soft wide-angle radiation, since it generates in\nEq. (11) terms proportional to (\u039b/(\u03c4 Q))2u . Similarly, the second term in Eq. (13) is associated with the jet function,\ncontaning collinear as well as soft enhancements.\nThe key step in DGE is to note that at LL level Sudakov resummation yields a simple exponentiation of the onegluon emission cross section in moment space. One can then retain all large-nf information, and the corresponding\nmodel of power corrections, in the Sudakov exponent by simply using the single dressed gluon cross section as kernel\nof exponentiation. One defines\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ k+i\u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03bd \u03bd\u03c4\n1 d\u03c3\n=\ne exp \u2212E(\u03bd, Q2 ) ,\n(14)\n\u03c3 d\u03c4 DGE\nk\u2212i\u221e 2\u03c0i\nwhere the Sudakov exponent is now given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\u2212u\n\u0001 1 d\u03c3\nCF\n\u2261\nB\u03c4 (\u03bd, u) .\ndu Q2 /\u039b2\nE(\u03bd, Q2 ) =\nd\u03c4 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03c3 d\u03c4 SDG 2\u03b20 0\n0\n\n(15)\n\nHere the single dressed gluon cross section is defined by Eq. (11), virtual corrections have been taken into account by\nsubtracting the value of the Laplace transform at \u03bd = 0, and in the second equality the Borel function B\u03c4 (\u03bd, u) for the\nSudakov exponent has been defined. As usual, all integrals are performed except the one on the Borel parameter u.\nAlthough formally similar to Eq. (11) for the single dressed gluon cross section, Eq. (15) has a much richer physical\ncontent, displayed by the nontrivial renormalon structure of the Borel function B\u03c4 (\u03bd, u). This is a consequence of the\nfact that exponentiation, subject to the constraint of energy conservation, has promoted the single gluon result to a\ngenuine approximation for multigluon emission1 . In the specific case of the thrust, the result for the Borel function\nis\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u00012\n2\n1\n1\nsin \u03c0u\n\u2212 \u0393(\u2212u) (\u03bd u \u2212 1)\n+\n+\n\u0393(\u22122u) \u03bd 2u \u2212 1\n.\n(16)\nB\u03c4 (\u03bd, u) = 2 e\u03bau\n\u03c0u\nu\nu 1\u2212u 2\u2212u\n\n1 In fact, the exponent E(\u03bd, Q2 ) has a natural interpretation in terms of the Borel representation of Sudakov anomalous dimensions\nassociated respectively with soft and collinear radiation [15]. Corrections subleading in nf change the the logarithmic behavior of the\ncross section as well as the size of the residues of poles in the Borel plane, but they are not expected to modify the analytic structure of\nB\u03c4 (\u03bd, u), which determines which power corrections are actually present.\n\nT005\n\n5\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nIt is useful to compare this result with the one for the C-parameter [10]\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u0393(u)\n2\nsin \u03c0u\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u0393(\u2212u) (\u03bd u \u2212 1)\nBc (\u03bd, u) = 2 e\u03bau\n\u0393(\u22122u) \u03bd 2u \u2212 1 21\u22122u 1\n.\n+\n+\n\u03c0u\nu 1\u2212u 2\u2212u\n\u0393( 2 + u)\n\n(17)\n\nClearly, Eqs. (16) and (17) are very similar; there are, however, important differences, which highlight the degree of\nuniversality to be expected in comparing the two distributions, and which can in principle be tested experimentally.\nFirst of all, the Borel functions contain perturbative information on Sudakov logarithms: although the exponentiation\nwas performed assuming independent gluon radiation, it can be shown [8] that one can upgrade the formalism to\nNLL accuracy by simply replacing the running coupling Eq. (10) with the two-loop expression, and by changing\nrenormalization scheme, including in the constant \u03ba the contribution of terms singular as x \u2192 1 in the NLO AltarelliParisi splitting function (the \"gluon bremsstrahlung\" scheme [21]). Beyond NLL, the coefficients of all subleading\nlogarithms can be computed in the large nf limit, by simply expanding the Borel function in powers of u, and\nreplacing un \u2192 n!(b0 \u03b1s /\u03c0)n+1 . Computing subleading logarithms uncovers the factorial growth of their coefficients,\nand can be used to gauge the reliability of perturbative resummation in different kinematical regimes. Next, one\nmay observe that the infrared safety of \u03c4 and C is once again reflected in the cancellation of the poles of both Borel\nfunctions at u = 0. One also notes that wide-angle soft radiation and collinear gluons contribute as before two\nseparate terms, and the jet functions (the terms proportional to \u0393(\u2212u)) are identical for the two observables2 . They\ncontribute renormalons at u = 1, 2, corresponding to exponentiated power corrections of the form (\u039b2 \u03bd/Q2 )1,2 . Soft\ngluon contributions, on the other hand, have renormalons at u = m/2, for all odd values of m, yielding the leading\npower corrections (\u039b\u03bd/Q)m , and they are quantitatively different for \u03c4 and C, distinguishing the two observables.\nSpecifically, by taking the ratio of the two \"soft functions\" (the terms proportional to \u0393(\u22122u)) and expanding in\npowers of u, one can verify that the two observables begin to differ perturbatively at NNLL level, as predicted\nin [22], but the growth of the coefficients of further subleading logarithms is weaker for the C-parameter than for\nthe thrust. Similarly, if one boldly takes the large-nf residues of the poles of the Borel functions as a reasonable\nestimate of the size of the corresponding power corrections, one observes that (\u039b\u03bd/Q)m corrections are systematically\nsmaller for the C parameter: the two shape functions should therefore differ, and one expects that the resummed\nperturbative prediction, as well as the approximation of the shape function by a constant shift, should work better\nphenomenologically for C than for \u03c4 .\n\n3. THE CLASS OF ANGULARITIES\nThe discussion in Sect. (2) illustrates the predictive power of DGE. Another interesting application concerns\nangularities, whose definition, Eq. (4), can be rewritten for massless particles as\n\u03c4a =\n\n1 X\na\n1\u2212a\n\u03c9i (sin \u03b8i ) (1 \u2212 |cos \u03b8i |)\n,\nQ i\n\n(18)\n\nwith \u03b8i the angle with respect to the thrust axis. Angularities (so christened in [12]) were introduced in [23] as\nauxiliary shape variables used to tame nonglobal logarithms [24] for observables related to out-of-jet energy flow.\nThey have several remarkable features, which make them very interesting for our understanding of QCD at the edge\nof the perturbative domain . First of all, they are characterized by a tunable parameter a, which can be used to\ninterpolate between different shapes, or to bring to focus specific momentum configurations in a continuous way. The\nparameter a must satisfy a < 2 for infrared safety, and a tighter restriction a < 1 is required in order to preserve\na relatively simple resummation in the Sudakov region, in the form of Eq. (5): for 1 \u2264 a < 2 further logarithmic\nsingularities associated with jet recoil must be taken into account [25]. For a = 1, one recognizes that \u03c41 = B, the\n\n2 Note\n\nT005\n\nthat Bc (\u03bd, u) is computed for a rescaled C parameter, c = C/6\n\n6\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nbroadening; for a = 0, \u03c40 = 1 \u2212 T ; for negative a, events dominated by high rapidity give increasingly suppressed\ncontributions to \u03c4a , which in turn suppresses power corrections of collinear origin; finally, for a \u2192 \u2212\u221e the distribution\nbecomes a \u03b4 function at \u03c4a = 0, with a strenght given by the total cross section.\nRemarkably, although the relative weights of rapidity and transverse momentum change with a, it is possible to\nderive a resummation formula [23] of the form of Eq. (5), valid for a < 1. Indeed, at NLL accuracy one can write\n\u0002\n\nln \u03c3\u0303 (\u03bd, a)\n\n\u0003\n\n=\n\nZ1\n0\n\ndu\nu\n\n\"\n\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010\n2/(2\u2212a)\n\u22121 + 2\nB \u03b1s (uQ ) e\u2212u \u03bd\n2\n\nZ\n\nuQ2\n\nu2 Q2\n\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010\n1\u2212a\na\ndq 2\nA \u03b1s (q 2 ) e\u2212u \u03bd(q/Q) \u2212 1\n2\nq\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nThe a dependence of Sudakov logarithms is clearly nontrivial: as an example, the function g1 (\u03b1s L) responsible for\nleading logarithms in Eq. (6) is given by\n\"\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013#\n\u0012\nx\nx\n4 2 \u2212 a A(1) 1 \u2212 x\nln 1 \u2212\n.\n(20)\nln (1 \u2212 x) \u2212 1 \u2212\ng1 (x, a) = \u2212\n\u03b20 1 \u2212 a x\n2\u2212a\n2\u2212a\n2\u2212a\nPower corrections, however, turn out to have a much simpler a dependence [11]. Performing the analysis leading to\nEq. (8), one easily finds that in the nonperturbative region all moments of the anomalous dimension A are multiplied\nby a simple common factor\n2\n\u03bb(a)\nn (\u03bc ) =\n\n1 1\n1\u2212a n\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2\n\n0\n\n\u0001\ndq 2 q n\u22122 A \u03b1s (q 2 ) =\n\n1\n\u03bb(0) (\u03bc2 ) .\n1\u2212a n\n\n(21)\n\nAs a consequence, the Laplace transform of the shape function defined by Eq.

Lacking a direct experimental\nanalysis, the scaling rule was tested against the output of PYTHIA, with positive results [11, 26]. The physical picture\nunderlying the scaling rule is appealing, and once again reminiscent of the \"tube model\". The relevant feature of the\nradiation pattern is boost invariance, which applies to soft gluons emitted in the two-jet limit, since such emissions\nare correctly represented by the eikonal approximation. This means that soft gluons contribute to the event shape a\nrapidity-independent amount, and in turn the integration over rapidity simply measures the size of the region where\ngluons can be emitted without strongly affecting the event shape. This region scales with (1 \u2212 a)\u22121 . The derivation\nof the scaling rule neglects correlations between gluons emitted into the opposite hemispheres defined by the thrust\naxis, which however are expected to become important only for a \u2265 1, the region excluded by the present treatment.\nThe main assumption is then that nonperturbative soft radiation should share the property of boost inveriance with\nthe relatively harder perturbative component which is treated by resummation. This is the nonperturbative property\nthat would be directly tested by an experimental study of Eq. (22).\nOne can go further, and study subleading power corrections, mostly related to radiation collinear to the hard jets.\nApplying the same method to the anomalous dimension B, and to the subleading terms generated by A, once again\none finds a simple pattern: the Laplace transform of the cross section can be expressed in factorized form, introducing\na subleading shape function, as\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n \u0303\n\u03c3\u0303 (\u03bd, a) = \u03c3\u0303PT (\u03bd, \u03ba, a) fa,NP\n,\u03ba .\n(23)\n, \u03ba g\u0303a,NP\nQ\nQ2\u2212a\nClearly, as a becomes large and negative, collinear power corrections are expected to become more and more negligible,\nand the scaling rule Eq. (22) is expected to hold with increasing accuracy.\nIn the light of the discussion of Sect. (2), it is interesting to verify whether these nice features of angularities are\npreserved in specific models for the shape function, such as DGE. This is particularly relevant in this case, since the\nT005\n\n7\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nkey result, Eq. (22), is related to boost invariance, which is broken by the formal introduction of gluon virtuality,\nwhich is a necessary tool of renormalon analysis. The study of angularities with DGE was performed in [12]. It\nis technically nontrivial, since the interplay of the parameter a with gluon virtuality and phase space constraints\nmakes it difficult to extract the a dependence analytically. The first step is to find an appropriate generalization\nof the definition of angularity to the case of single massive gluon emission. Such definition should have the correct\nlimit as \u03be \u2192 0, reduce to known results for thrust as a \u2192 0, and be simple enough to keep the computational task\nmanageable. At one loop, one such definition is\n\u03c4a =\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 xi )1\u2212a/2 h\n(1 \u2212 xj \u2212 \u03be)1\u2212a/2 (1 \u2212 xk + \u03be)a/2 + (j \u2194 k) ,\nxi\n\n(24)\n\nwhere xn = 2pn *Q/Q2 are the customary energy fraction variables, and the definition applies to the phase space region\nwhere the gluon is soft; xi is then the (anti)quark energy fraction. With this definition, it is possible to construct\nthe Borel function for the Sudakov exponent for angularities, in analogy with Eqs. (16) and (17). Remarkably, the\nsoft component of the Borel function, responsible for all leading power corrections, is just the expected rescaling of\nEq. (16),\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u00012\nsin \u03c0u\n1\n2 e\u03bau\n,\n(25)\nBasoft (\u03bd, u) =\n\u0393(\u22122u) \u03bd 2u \u2212 1\n1\u2212a\n\u03c0u\nu\n\nwhich leads once again to the scaling rule, Eq. (22). Collinear power corrections are much more difficult to handle\nanalitycally, and the collinear counterpart of Eq. (25) can at best be expressed in terms of a one-dimensional integral\nrepresentation, which reduces to combinations of hypergeometric functions for rational values of a. This is however\nenough to classify the singularities in the Borel parameter u, and thus the pattern of power corrections. One indeed\nfinds that all these subleading power corrections can be organized in a single shape function g\u0303, depending only on\nthe combination \u03bd/Q2\u2212a , as in Eq. (23). DGE thus confirms the general scaling behavior found from resummation,\nshowing that the introduction of gluon virtuality does not spoil the effects of boost invariance in the Sudakov limit.\nThrust, jet masses, angularities and the C parameter are all found to have closely related pattern of power corrections,\nhighlighted by the scaling rule relating generic angularities to the thrust. Clearly, this is a highly predictive framework,\nand our understanding of soft radiation in the two-jet limit can be put to stringent tests.\n\n4. HADRON COLLIDER EVENT SHAPES\nAs we approach the expected date for the start up of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, it is natural and\nappropriate to ask whether tools like those described here could be applicable in the environment of hadron collisions,\nand, if so, to what extent power corrections might be relevant to our understanding of the data, at the extreme energies\navailable at the LHC. Beginning with the second question, one might naively observe that \u039b/Q must be a very small\nnumber for any reasonable value of the hard scale Q that one might envisage at the LHC. It would not be wise,\nhowever, to neglect power correction studies on this basis, for at least three different reasons.\nFirst of all, it has already been shown at the Tevatron that power corrections have an impact even on observables\nwhich are largely dominated by high p\u22a5 events, and even at very high energy [27]. In Ref. [27], Mangano considered\nthe single-jet inclusive E\u22a5 distribution, comparing data at different CM energies. One sees that ratios of cross sections\nat different energies do not have the proper scaling behavior dictated by NLO QCD, but the correct behavior can\nbe recovered by including a power correction determined by a single parameter associated with the normalization of\nthe jet transverse energy. The reason is that even a small shift in the jet E\u22a5 is amplified in the distribution by the\n\u2212n\nfact that the cross section is falling steeply for increasing E\u22a5 , so that \u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3 \u223c \u2212n \u03b4E\u22a5 if \u03c3 \u223c E\u22a5\n. One can expect\nthat in general power corrections will be important for the determination of jet energy scales, and in turn accurate\nknowledge of these scales may well turn out to be crucial for many high energy studies.\nThe second reason is that almost any LHC observable will require, before it can be compared with a theoretical\nprediction, a subtraction of all hadronic activity unrelated to the hard scattering, loosely referred to as \"underlying\nT005\n\n8\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\nevent\". There is currently very little, if any, theoretical control on the underlying event, which at the LHC will\ncontain a mix of multiple parton scattering, beam-beam interactions and soft radiation associated with the selected\nhard process. Even Monte-Carlo methods have difficulties in finding the proper tuning to describe this kind of\nphysics (see, for example, [28]). In this context, the lesson of power correction studies in the gentler environment of\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation or DIS is that we might learn to discriminate between the different components of soft radiation in\nhadron collisions. On the one hand there are soft and collinear gluons associated with the hard scattering event: their\neffects are in principle computable in PQCD, using generalizations of the known techniques, and their distribution in\nphase space and in the space of color configurations will be nontrivial and predictable. On the other hand, there is\nsoft radiation which is in practice out of reach for the techniques of PQCD, such as minijets due to multiple parton\nscattering or soft gluons arising from beam-beam interactions. This second kind of radiation fills phase space with\na high degree of uniformity, and will have to be modelled with different techniques, including Monte-Carlo tools.\nThis kind of statistical modelling is bound to be more successful if we can first achieve a better understanding of the\n\"pure\" hard scattering process, including the energy and color flow that it generates at all scales.\nFinally, it should be emphasized that the physics of event shapes at hadron colliders is interesting for its own\nsake, as a probe to understand hadronization in terms of both momentum and color flow. It is well known that for\nhadron collisions, where most processes involve four partons already at Born level, Sudakov resummation is expressed\nin terms of anomalous dimension matrices that tie together color exchange and momentum flow. This interplay is\nbound to influence the pattern of power corrections as well, and studies of this kind may well lead to deep insights\ninto the mechanics of color neutralization and hadron formation.\nPreliminary studies of resummed event shapes at hadron colliders have already been performed [29, 30], and a\ngeneralization of the notion of angularity to a hadronic environment has been proposed [31]. For most of these\nproposals, a primary concern is that of suppressing the contributions of particles close to the beam axis, where\nbeam remnants interfere with all measurements. It should be noted, however, that soft radiation associated with\nthe underlying event tends to fill phase space, including regions separated in rapidity from both the beam and the\nhigh-p\u22a5 jets. It would therefore be of great interest to find event shapes designed to focus on this kind of wide-angle\nradiation, where it would be most useful to disentangle soft gluons generated by the hard scattering from the genuine\nunderlying event (a pioneering study with a similar goal is [32]). A promising avenue of investigation might be the\nuse of observables such as those introduced in [23], joint distributions correlating energy flow in a chosen angular\nregion \u03a9 with a standard event shape such as ordinary angularity. The form of such a correlation is\n\n\u03c3 (\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , a) =\n\n1 X\n2\n|M (N )| \u03b4(\u01eb1 \u2212 f\u03a9 (N )) \u03b4(\u01eb2 \u2212 \u03c4a(1) (N ) \u2212 \u03c4a(2) (N )) ,\n2s\n\n(26)\n\nN\n\n(i)\n\nwhere f\u03a9 (N ) is an observable related to energy flow into the angular region \u03a9, away from hard jets, while \u03c4a (N )\nare the contributions to angularity from the two hemispheres defined by the thrust axis.\nIn a hadronic environment, one might envisage measuring angularities with respect to the current jet axis, as\nsuggested in [31], or even introducing a third parameter \u01eb3 to constrain radiation near the beam remnants. Tuning\nthe various parameters and energy threshold in such observables one would be able to focus on different regions of\nphase space, forcing the observable to be more or less inclusive for soft gluons, or for particles collinear either to\nthe beam or to the current jets. Notice that boost invariance, underlying the scaling rule for angularities, is lost in\nhadron collisions, where correlations between beam jets and current jets must be taken into account.\nClearly, event shape studies at hadron colliders are in their early days. I believe that such studies will be both\ninstrumental to further our understanding of QCD, and very helpful in order to exploit the full potential of the LHC,\na task which will require a solid understanding of strong interactions as much as good skills in the building and\ntesting of new physics models.\nT005\n\n9\n\n\fFRIF Workshop on First Principles Non-Perturbative QCD of Hadron Jets\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Carola Berger and Einan Gardi, who worked with me on the research described here, and went\nover the draft of this contribution, spotting several misprints and one significant inaccuracy, now fixed.
