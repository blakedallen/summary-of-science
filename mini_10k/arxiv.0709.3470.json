The clustering of dark matter is not usually observed directly, however, though weak lensing shear-shear correlations can\nprovide (at present noisy) estimates. Redshift surveys may furnish us with galaxy clustering statistics (see, e.g., Peacock 2003),\nwhile weak lensing measurements, for example, normally probe\nthe cross-correlation between galaxies and dark matter (Refregier\n2003, and references therein).\nGalaxy clustering statistics derive a great deal of their power\nto constrain cosmological parameters by constraining the scale at\nwhich the power spectrum 'turns over' on large scales, which complements the high-redshift CMB constraint on this scale rather well.\nThe baryonic features in the correlation function or power spectrum add to the effectiveness of the constraint (Cole et al. 2005;\nEisenstein et al. 2005). The scales used in these joint constraints\ntend to be large scales, where the evolution of clustering is still in\nthe linear regime or where deviations from linearity can be more\nreadily modelled. Moreover, in this regime the galaxy correlation\nfunction is expected, in the absence of non-local effects, to have\nthe same shape as the mass correlation function, though offset by a\nconstant factor (see, e.g., Coles 1993). This offset \u2013 the (square of\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: harker@astro.rug.nl\n\nthe) bias \u2013 depends on the galaxy population under consideration;\nit depends, for example, on the threshold luminosity of the sample.\nBecause of this uncertainty, when the galaxy correlation function is\nused to constrain cosmology, information on its overall normalization is not normally used, and the constraints come entirely from\nits shape.\nIn this paper we generate synthetic galaxy clustering statistics\nby painting galaxies from a semi-analytic model onto dark matter\ndistributions given by N -body simulations. We then compare these\nclustering statistics with those from the SDSS to attempt to constrain cosmology. We can see the possibility for various benefits\nfrom our approach. Firstly, because we attempt to generate realistic\ncatalogues with full galaxy properties, we can make a prediction\nfor the bias factor of a given galaxy sample and hence use the overall normalization of the correlation function in our cosmological\nconstraints. In particular, we may be able to constrain \u03c38 , which\nis not possible for normal techniques employing galaxy clustering.\nSecondly, because we populate the simulations on a halo-by-halo\nbasis rather than just assuming that galaxies approximately trace\nmass on large scales, we generate a theoretical prediction for the\nsmall-scale, nonlinear clustering. We can therefore attempt to use\nthis information in our cosmological constraints too.\nOur constraints are largely independent from those using the\nCMB, and involve different assumptions (though we consider only\nflat models, which one could regard as implicitly using CMB\nresults). Because dark energy has an effect on structure formation, and different forms of dark energy might affect it in different ways at late times, it is useful to have an independent,\n\n\f2\n\nG. Harker et al.\n\nlow-redshift constraint on \u03c38 that does not rely on a joint analysis with high-redshift data (Doran, Schwindt & Wetterich 2001;\nBartelmann, Doran & Wetterich 2006). A joint analysis would tend\nto be more model-dependent as one must be able to model what\nhappens in the gap between observed snapshots of the Universe.\n\n2 CONSTRUCTING GALAXY CATALOGUES\n2.1 Simulations\nIn choosing parameters for our simulations, our aim was to generate simulation outputs for a range of different values of \u03a9M and \u03c38\nso that we could examine galaxy clustering as a function of these\nquantities. Given our focus on constraining \u03c38 , we opted to generate outputs with \u03c38 taking values between 0.65 and 1.05, regularly\nspaced in steps of 0.05.\nMeasurements of the abundance of clusters constrain the highmass end of the halo mass function, and hence constrain a combination of \u03a9M and \u03c38 (e.g., Eke, Cole & Frenk 1996). This combination is, very approximately, \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM . To test if we could break this\ndegeneracy, we have generated two grids of models. For Grid 1, the\n0.5\n, while for\nparameters of each model satisfy \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = 0.8(0.3)\n0.5\nGrid 2 they satisfy \u03c38 \u03a9M\n= 0.9(0.3)0.5 . Within each grid, \u03c38\ntakes on its full range of values between 0.65 and 1.05. It would be\nvery difficult to distinguish between two cosmologies lying on the\nsame grid using cluster abundances. The two 'cluster normalization' curves, with \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = const., are shown as the long-dashed\nand short-dashed lines in Fig. 1. The pairs (\u03a9M , \u03c38 ) labelling the\ncosmologies we analyse are plotted as crosses on these curves.\nWe extract the mass distribution for these cosmologies from\ntwo simulations run using the TREE - PM N -body code GADGET 2\n(Springel, Yoshida & White 2001; Springel 2005). Each simulation\nfollows the evolution of 5123 particles in a 300 h\u22121 Mpc box. We\nhave stored the simulation output at several redshifts. Each of these\nsnapshots of the mass distribution is then interpreted as a z = 0.1\nsnapshot of a simulation with a different cosmology, to avoid having to run a great number of simulations. We choose z = 0.1\nsince this is near the median redshift of the main SDSS and 2dFGRS galaxy samples. The output redshifts are chosen so that once\nthe simulations are relabelled as z = 0.1 snapshots, the value of\n\u03c38 at z = 0 for each simulation falls onto a regular grid. Each\nsimulation then gives us snapshots with \u03c38 taking values between\n0.65 and 1.05, regularly spaced by 0.05. Table 1 gives the value\nof \u03a9M and \u03c38 in these relabelled snapshots. We have chosen the\nsimulation parameters such that the first simulation, 'Run 1', has\n\u03a9M = 0.3 at its \u03c38 = 0.8 output, while the second simulation,\n'Run 2', has \u03a9M = 0.3 at its \u03c38 = 0.9 output. When we perform\na further rescaling of \u03a9M (see below) it is these central snapshots\nwhich remain unchanged. The initial conditions are calculated using a Bardeen et al. (1986) power spectrum with shape parameter\n\u0393 = 0.14 and with primordial spectral index ns = 1. A smooth\npower spectrum was most convenient in the light of the rescalings\nwe carry out on the final output, but in fact the Bardeen et al. (1986)\npower spectrum with \u0393 = 0.14 was found to be a good fit to the\nCMBFAST (Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996) spectrum with \u03a9b = 0.045\nused for the Millennium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005), the parameters of which were chosen to be in agreement with the oneyear WMAP results (Spergel et al. 2003).\nOnce we have relabelled the simulation snapshots as z = 0.1\nsnapshots, they lie on a curve in (\u03a9M , \u03c38 ) space which reflects\nthe way the dark matter density is reduced and the amplitude of\n\nFigure 1. The position in the (\u03a9M , \u03c38 ) plane of the outputs of our two\nsimulations. The line connecting the outputs shows how the values of \u03a9M\nand \u03c38 change as the simulation evolves, where we track the instantaneous\nvalues of these parameters rather than the values they will have at the final time, which would be the more conventional labelling (and would, of\ncourse, not change during the course of the simulation). The solid line corresponds to Run 1 and the dotted line corresponds to Run 2. Low redshift\noutputs (lower density, more clustered) are in the top left, while high redshift outputs (higher density, less clustered) are in the bottom right. Also\nshown are the curves described by the cluster normalization condition that\n\u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = const. for two different values of this constant. We rescale\nsimulation outputs so that they lie on these curves. The rescaling is shown\nschematically by the red arrows.\n\nclustering is increased as the simulation evolves. These curves are\nshown as the solid and dotted lines in Fig. 1. We rescale \u03a9M in each\nsnapshot, so that instead the snapshots lie on one of the clusternormalized curves described above. The rescaling is achieved in\npractice by applying the results of Zheng et al. (2002). If the particle mass is scaled in the obvious way to obtain the desired \u03a9M ,\nthe particle velocities must also be scaled to compensate, else the\nhaloes no longer satisfy the virial relation between their kinetic\nand potential energy, and the galaxy populations of haloes are easily distinguished in the different cosmologies via dynamical observables. The rescalings in \u03a9M which move a snapshot onto the\ncluster-normalization curve are shown schematically as red arrows\nin Fig. 1. Each cluster-normalized grid contains rescaled snapshots\nfrom both simulations, and the simulation parameters were chosen\nso that the rescalings would never have to be too large. For some of\nthe cosmologies on our grid, we could choose to rescale from either of our simulation runs without having to change \u03a9M by a large\nfactor. We have used these cosmologies to test that the results using\neither simulation run are consistent, and hence that our rescaling\nworks as expected.\nThe simulation code runs SUBFIND (Springel et al. 2001)\non the fly, providing us with a list of friends-of-friends haloes\n(Davis et al. 1985) of more than 20 particles, and their substructures. We use a linking length of 0.2 times the mean inter-particle\nseparation in the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify the haloes.\nSUBFIND also allows us to identify the particle in the halo with\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\nTable 1.

For the purposes of\nthis paper, we may consider a semi-analytic model as being a means\nof predicting, given some dark matter halo at a redshift of interest,\nthe galaxy population of that halo. Having that information, we can\nconstruct galaxy luminosity functions, correlation functions, etc.\nthat might be considered the results or predictions of the model.\nThe first step in predicting the galaxy population of a halo is\ncalculating the merger history of the halo. In simulations of sufficiently high resolution and with a sufficiently large number of outputs, this can be extracted from the N -body data. In the case of\nGALFORM , this has been done recently by Bower et al. (2006) with\nthe Millennium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005); the same simulation has also been used by Croton et al. (2006) and De Lucia et al.\n(2006) to generate catalogues using a different semi-analytic code.\nThe simulations we describe above, by contrast, do not have sufficient resolution for us to extract reliable merger trees for the\nhaloes of interest. A Monte Carlo scheme based on the work\nof Lacey & Cole (1993) and using the algorithm described by\nCole et al. (2000) is employed instead, therefore. This generates a\nmerger tree for a halo based only on the halo mass, the cosmology\nand the initial power spectrum, and does not use other data from\nthe simulation. This scheme does not, therefore, provide galaxy\npositions; our method of placing galaxies is given, instead, in Section 2.3.\nUnfortunately, the statistical properties of merger histories\ngenerated by this algorithm are not identical to histories extracted directly from an N -body simulation (Cole et al. 2007).\nParkinson, Cole & Helly (2007) and Neistein & Dekel (2007) have\ndevised empirically motivated modifications to the algorithm to allow Monte Carlo trees to fit the simulation data better. A detailed\nanalysis of the effect of such a modification on semi-analytic galaxy\nproperties is beyond the scope of this paper. We have, though, tested\nsome of our results using the new algorithm of Parkinson et al.\n(2007), and find that for our purposes the new trees make little difference.\nGiven the merger history of a halo, the model computes the\nevolution of the baryonic content of the halo using a variety of analytic prescriptions. Many of the equations governing the physical\nprocesses modelled by GALFORM contain parameters which may\n\n3\n\nbe adjusted. Some of these (for example, the form factor forbit /c\nwhich governs the size of merger remnants) have a 'natural' value\ndetermined by the physics; others (those governing the angular momentum distribution of infalling haloes, say) are derived by comparison to more detailed simulations. The function of allowing\nthese parameters to change, then, is to allow investigation into the\nmagnitude of the effect of different physical processes on the resulting galaxy properties in the model. Other parameters have no\nnatural value, and can only be fixed by requiring that they take values which allow the model to fit observations. Much of the time, if\nwe are able to fit some set of observations satisfactorily by choosing the parameters of the model judiciously, the same set of observations could also be fit reasonably well by some very different\nchoice of parameters. Therefore, within the GALFORM framework,\nwe have different models using different physics which are equally\ngood at matching the observations (though this may not, of course,\nbe the case if we were to choose a different set of observations to\nconstrain the model).\nOur aim here is to try to constrain cosmological parameters by\ncomparing clustering statistics from a simulation populated with\nsemi-analytic galaxies to the corresponding measurements in an\nobservational survey. We would hope that our constraints are insensitive to the precise semi-analytic model used, and we would like\nto test whether this is the case. Therefore, although we use only\none code, GALFORM, we use three different 'models', in the sense\nof different combinations of the physics we attempt to model and\nthe parameters governing that physics. In the remainder of this section of the paper, we discuss the technical differences between the\nthree models before briefly describing how galaxies are placed in\nthe simulations in Section 2.3. A reader uninterested in the details\nof the models may therefore wish to skip to 2.3, or to our results in\nSection 3. The three models are as follows:\n\u2022 The fiducial model of Cole et al. (2000). This is successful in\nmatching several sets of observations, including the B- and K-band\nluminosity functions, galaxy colours and mass-to-light ratios for\ngalaxies of different morphologies, the cold gas mass in galaxies,\ngalaxy disc sizes and the slope and scatter of the I-band TullyFisher relation. Unfortunately, though, it assumes a cosmic baryon\nfraction, \u03a9b , of only 0.02. This is inconsistent with recent estimates\nfrom Big Bang nucleosynthesis (e.g., O'Meara et al. 2001) and the\ncosmic microwave background (Spergel et al. 2007). Nevertheless,\nwe feel it is worthwhile to include this model in our analysis as\na well recognized and well understood model that has been thoroughly described and studied. In our figures, lines corresponding\nto output from this model are given the label 'Cole2000'.\n\u2022 A model similar to the first, but with \u03a9b = 0.04, which is\ncloser to current estimates. Since there are twice as many baryons\nas in the first model, if we leave the rest of the parameters unchanged then, as expected, the model is unable to match observations such as the luminosity function. Therefore we introduce a\nnew physical process: thermal conduction in massive haloes (this\nis analysed in greater detail by Benson et al. 2003). We simply assume that gas is unable to cool if the halo circular velocity, Vcirc ,\nsatisfies\n\u221a\nVcirc > Vcond 1 + z ,\n(1)\nwhere Vcond is a parameter we may adjust. This suppresses the\nproblematic bright end of the luminosity function; the effect is similar, in fact, to more recent and more physically motivated implementations of feedback from active galactic nuclei in GALFORM\n(Bower et al. 2006). Though it is clearly rather crude, note that our\n\n\f4\n\nG. Harker et al.\n\nobjective here is only to produce a realistic enough galaxy catalogue to compare to observations. We are trying to mimic the\neffect of whatever physical process suppresses the bright end of\nthe luminosity function, without having to adopt a complicated\nparametrization that is no better physically motivated than a more\nsimple and understandable one. The label we give to this model\nin our figures is 'C2000hib' (where 'hib' stands for 'high baryon\nfraction').\n\u2022 Another model with \u03a9b = 0.04, but now incorporating 'superwinds'. In this model it is postulated that a galaxy's cold gas\nis heated strongly enough for it to be expelled completely from\nthe halo, rather than returning to the reservoir of hot gas associated with the halo. In fact, the model is derived from that used by\nBaugh et al. (2005) to reproduce the abundance of faint galaxies\ndetected at submillimetre wavelengths. This also incorporates the\nadditions and refinements to GALFORM described by Benson et al.\n(2003). These include a modification to the assumed profile of the\nhalo gas, a more sophisticated treatment of conduction, and a more\ndetailed treatment of galaxy mergers, in particular the effects of\ntidal stripping and dynamical friction (Benson et al. 2002). They\nalso include a simple model of the effect of reionization on small\nhaloes, where cooling is prevented if Vcirc < Vcut and z < zcut for\ntwo parameters Vcut and zcut . The strength of superwind feedback\nis parametrized by VSW , the characteristic velocity of the wind. The\nmodel is denoted 'Model M' in our figures.\n\nreluctant to run, while in others the fit for some observations is\ncompromised in an attempt to fit the 0.1 r-band luminosity function\nwell. In addition to running each model with tweaked parameters in\neach cosmology, therefore, we also run each model in each cosmology using the same parameters as the central cosmology of Run 1,\nin which (\u03a9M , \u03c38 ) = (0.3, 0.8).\nWe are not able to produce a good fit to the luminosity function in a \u03c72 sense, even allowing these parameters to vary. This may\nbe a concern when comparing clustering statistics to observational\ndata. Volume-limited galaxy samples, to which we wish to compare\nour results later, are chosen such that all the galaxies are brighter\nthan some given absolute magnitude limit. If we choose a sample\nof semi-analytic galaxies with the same magnitude limit, then because our luminosity function is wrong we may not be choosing a\nsample that necessarily corresponds to the observational one, even\nwithin our model. Therefore we instead select semi-analytic galaxy\nsamples with a magnitude such that the sample has the same space\ndensity as the corresponding observational sample. This means that\nwhen we adjust the parameters of the model to match the luminosity function, it is more important for our purposes to match its\noverall shape rather than its magnitude normalization.\nThe \u03a5 parameter of Cole et al. (2000) is related to this sort of\nscaling of the luminosity function. It was introduced to account for\nbrown dwarfs, which absorb some of the mass of gas assumed to\nbe tied up in stars, but without producing light. It is defined by\n\nWe wish to run each of these models in many different cosmologies, in order to generate galaxy catalogues in which the N body component and the semi-analytic component are consistent.\nChanging cosmology naturally changes the galaxy population predicted by each model, however, so that even if we fix the parameters\nsuch that the galaxies match observational constraints in one fiducial cosmology, they are unlikely to match in other cosmologies.\nWe therefore tweak the parameters between different cosmologies\nto try to match the data. It is not possible to do this for the full range\nof even the primary constraints described by Cole et al. (2000). We\nrestrict ourselves to a comparison with the 0.1 r-band SDSS luminosity function of Blanton et al. (2003) at z = 0.1. Even then, to\nmake the problem tractable and to ensure our three models remain\ndistinct, we restrict the parameters we allow ourselves to vary to:\n\nmass in visible stars + mass in brown dwarfs\n(4)\nmass in visible stars\n(Cole et al. 2000, equation 5.2). Clearly, then, we must have \u03a5 > 1\ngiven this physical explanation. The result of including this effect\nis to scale luminosities by a factor 1/\u03a5. For each GALFORM model\nwe run, we compare the resulting 0.1 r-band luminosity function\nwith the observational value from the SDSS (in fact, we compare\nonly one point near the characteristic luminosity, L\u2217 ). We express\nthe difference between the two in terms of the \u03a5 parameter: the\n(reciprocal of the) amount by which we would have to scale the\nluminosity of the semi-analytic galaxies to match the data. Sometimes this requires \u03a5 < 1. Therefore, when we give a value of \u03a5\nbelow, it should be treated only as an indication of the amount by\nwhich we would have to scale luminosities so that when we select\na galaxy sample by a number density threshold then it would have\nthe same luminosity threshold as the observational sample. Note\nthat we calculate \u03a5 by reference to a specific point on the SDSS\n0.1\nr-band luminosity function. Its exact value would change if we\nnormalized at a different point (since the model luminosity function is not the same shape as the observational one), or in a different\nband (since the colour of model galaxies may be incorrect).\nOnce we have given ourselves the freedom to scale the luminosity function in this way, then, the effect of varying the parameters we allow ourselves to change to try to match the shape of the\nluminosity function is as follows:\n\n\u2022 VSW , for Model M only.\n\u2022 Vcond , for the C2000hib model only.\n\u2022 Vcut , one of the parameters controlling reionization. Though\nwe experimented with changing this for all the models, all the\nones below have either Vcut = 0 (Cole2000 and C2000hib) or\nVcut = 60 (Model M). As well as being simpler, this also helps\nmake Model M more distinct from the other two.\n\u2022 Vhot and \u03b1hot . These are closely linked but we vary them independently. They control the strength of standard (i.e. not superwind) supernova feedback in the following way. The rate of change\nof the mass of hot gas and of cool gas in a halo are linked with the\ninstantaneous star formation rate, \u03c8, by:\n\u1e40hot = \u2212\u1e40cool + \u03b2\u03c8\n\n(2)\n\n(Cole et al. 2000, equation 4.7). \u03b2 is related to the circular velocity\nof the galaxy disc, Vdisc , by\n\u03b2 = (Vdisc /Vhot )\u2212\u03b1hot\n\n(3)\n\n(Cole et al. 2000, equation 4.15).\nSome of the cosmologies below require quite extreme, perhaps unphysical, parameter values. In some cases, GALFORM is\n\n\u03a5=\n\n\u2022 Increasing VSW , or decreasing Vcond , tends to steepen the\nbright-end slope, i.e. give fewer very bright galaxies. VSW is only\nnon-zero for Model M; Vcond is only finite for the C2000hib model.\n\u2022 Increasing Vcut reduces the slope at the faint end, reducing the\nnumber of the faintest of the galaxies we study.\n\u2022 Increasing Vhot tends to suppress the overall space density of\ngalaxies. Because of the effect of the other parameters, it is most\nuseful for adjusting the abundance of galaxies of around L\u2217 , or a\nlittle fainter.\n\u2022 Changes in \u03b1hot can be viewed as modulating the effect of\nchanging Vhot . Visually, for typical values of Vhot , increasing \u03b1hot\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\n\nFigure 2. r-band luminosity functions for the three fiducial GALFORM\nmodels, compared to the SDSS luminosity function of Blanton et al. (2003)\n(solid line) and a 2dFGRS r-band luminosity function (dotted line, mostly\nobscured by the others) generated using the SuperCosmos rF -band data\n(Hambly et al. 2001). The value of the scaling parameter \u03a5, required to\nnormalize the model luminosities for galaxies of a particular space density\nin this band, is also given in the legend. Errors on the SDSS luminosity\nfunction are only given for every tenth point, for clarity.\n\n5\n\nshape of the luminosity function. We therefore need \u03a5 \u223c 0.5 to recover the correct luminosities, while the C2000hib model needs a\nmuch more physically palatable \u03a5 \u223c 1.2. It may appear that our requirement for \u03a5 \u223c 0.5 is inconsistent with the original Cole et al.\n(2000) paper, the reference model of which requires \u03a5 = 1.38.\nIt is not inconsistent, for a few reasons. Firstly, we use the label\n'Cole2000' for our model because it uses equivalent code with the\nsame physics governed by the same parameters as the models of\nCole et al. (2000). As we have just noted, however, some of the parameters take different values in our fiducial model in order to try to\nmatch the shape of the r-band luminosity function. Secondly, while\nthe reference model of Cole et al. (2000) had \u03c38 = 0.93, ours has\n\u03c38 = 0.8. Thirdly, their \u03a5 was calculated by reference to the value\nof the observed bJ band luminosity function at L\u2217 (though in fact\nthe same correction also provided a good match to the K-band luminosity function). Ours is calculated by reference to the r-band\nluminosity function. We match to a point slightly brighter than L\u2217\n(where the exponential cutoff has started to bite more deeply and\nthe galaxies are less abundant; the point at Mr \u223c \u221221.5 can be\nseen quite easily in Fig. 2 as being where all the lines cross) since\nwe otherwise had problems calculating \u03a5 for some of our models\nwith a very shallow faint-end slope and low galaxy number density.\n\n2.3 Galaxy placement\n\nflattens the faint-end slope, typically over a wider range of luminosities than Vcut .\nWe usually find that to make the bright-end slope steeper and to\nmake the faint-end slope shallower, as required by the data, needs\nall parameters tweaked to give larger amounts of feedback. This\ntends to have the overall effect of reducing the predicted luminosities, leading to \u03a5 < 1 as mentioned above. Requiring \u03a5 > 1\nwould therefore require us to compromise one component or other\nof the shape in these models. Since we later rescale to match space\ndensities anyway, we opt not to make this compromise. Given two\nparameter combinations which both match the luminosity function\nreasonably well and which both give \u03a5 < 1, we use the \u03a5 parameter as a tie-breaker, selecting the combination which gives \u03a5 closer\nto unity. We have also checked that each model is at least qualitatively consistent with the other primary GALFORM constraints (the\nTully-Fisher relation, disc sizes, morphological mix, metallicities\nand gas fractions \u2013 see Cole et al. 2000).\nThe r-band luminosity function for each of our models in\nour fiducial cosmology (\u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03c38 = 0.8) is shown in\nFig. 2. Qualitatively, the agreement between the models and the\ndata is reasonable. The very sharp cutoff at the bright end of the\nluminosity function in Model M is a generic feature of the model.\nThe lower space density of very faint galaxies in this model is also\ngeneric, and comes from the introduction of reionization (non-zero\nVcut ). At first glance, it appears that the Cole2000 model gives better agreement with the data at the bright end than the C2000hib\nmodel, despite the inclusion of a feedback mechanism specifically\nto solve this problem in the latter. Recall, though, that the Cole2000\nmodel has a lower baryon fraction, and despite this we have to introduce relatively high levels of supernova feedback to match the\n\nWith the N -body simulations and the semi-analytic catalogues in\nplace, it remains to merge the two to create a synthetic galaxy catalogue, or in other words to populate the simulations with our galaxies. To each halo in the simulation we assign a semi-analytic galaxy\npopulation for a random merger tree of the same mass. We then\nplace the central galaxy at the position of the particle with least\ngravitational potential energy, and place the satellite galaxies on\nrandom particles within the halo.\nOne might worry that given the resolution of our simulations,\nit is possible for the semi-analytic model to predict that a halo in\na simulation contains a bright enough galaxy to enter our sample\neven though the halo is not resolved with at least 20 particles, which\nis our normal criterion for considering the halo to be resolved. To\ntake account of these galaxies, we calculate the number of such\nhaloes expected for the simulation volume for the Jenkins et al.\n(2001) mass function. We then take the galaxy populations predicted by GALFORM for these haloes and place the galaxies on random particles in the simulation which are not in haloes. We do not\nexpect this to have a significant effect on clustering statistics, since\nalmost all galaxies which would be placed in unresolved haloes are\nvery faint, and in any case the halo bias as a function of mass is\nnot strongly varying in this regime (Cole & Kaiser 1989; Mo et al.\n1999) so that we do not lose too much accuracy by placing galaxies\nin haloes of the wrong mass. None the less, we have checked that\nemploying this scheme has only a small effect on our measured correlation functions. Changing the minimum resolved mass from 20\nparticles to 50 particles has only a very small effect on the correlation function, as does ignoring the 'unresolved' galaxies entirely,\neven for a conservative mass limit of 50 particles. Moreover, this\nremains true even for galaxy samples which are rather faint when\ncompared to the magnitude limit of the SDSS samples we will be\nconsidering, and which therefore provide a more stringent test.\n\n\f6\n\nG.

(2005) calculated the projected two-point correlation function wp (rp ) for ten different galaxy samples defined\nby thresholds in absolute magnitude. We have been provided with\nthese correlation functions, and their covariance matrices calculated by jackknife resampling. Zehavi et al. (2005) also tabulate the\nspace density of each sample, so it is straightforward for us to select\ncorresponding samples of semi-analytic galaxies.\nOur cosmological constraints will use samples with a galaxy\n\nspace density n\u0304g = 0.00308 h3 Mpc\u22123 , corresponding to galaxies with Mr \u2212 5 log10 h < \u221220.5 in the SDSS. Our semi-analytic\ncatalogues have approximately twice the effective volume of the\nobservational sample, so when calculating how well our models\nfit the data we use only the covariance matrix of the observational\ncorrelation function to compute our errors, neglecting the statistical\nerrors on the simulated function. We use the sample of this space\ndensity since it provides a good compromise between volume and\nspace density, giving relatively small errors, and since most of the\nconstraining power then comes from the galaxies of intermediate\nluminosity which are modelled best by the semi-analytic code. We\nwill, though, briefly discuss the effect of using samples of a different space density or selected in a different waveband.\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

The first column\ngives the label we assign to each of our 12 sets of populated simulations\n(each of which has nine cosmologies, regularly spaced in \u03c38 ). The 'Grid'\nin the second column refers to whether the cosmologies lie on the cluster\nnormalized curve with high \u03a9M (Grid 1) or low \u03a9M (Grid 2).

A comparison between our four sets of models for one particular\nvalue of \u03c38 . The top two panels are for models in which we tweak the semianalytic parameters to match the r-band luminosity function, while for the\nbottom two the parameters stay the same as for our fiducial model. The two\nleft-hand panels are for the low-\u03a9M cluster normalization curve while the\nothers are for the high-\u03a9M case. The colour coding and line styles of the\nmodels are the same as for Figs. 2 and 3.\n\n3.2 Constraints\nWe compare the clustering in our synthetic catalogues and in the\nSDSS in Fig. 3. We plot the quantity rp wp (rp ) since this scales out\nmuch of the rp dependence and makes differences in shape easier to\nsee. Fig. 3 shows our results for a grid of nine cosmologies spaced\n0.5\nregularly in \u03c38 such that they lie on the curve \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = 0.8(0.3)\n('Grid 1'). For this plot we show the models for which we allow the\nsemi-analytic parameters to vary so as to provide a good match for\nthe r-band luminosity function. Note that we have three other similar sets of models: one which includes the same cosmologies but\nin which the semi-analytic parameters are identical in each cosmology, and two more in which the cosmologies lie on the same grid\n0.5\nin \u03c38 but which have lower \u03a9M , such that \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = 0.9(0.3)\n('Grid 2'). In one low-\u03a9M sequence the semi-analytic parameters\nare allowed to vary, and in the other they are not. A figure similar to\nFig. 3 could be made for each of the latter three sets of catalogues,\nbut since the features turn out to be qualitatively similar we do not\nshow such plots here. We do, though, compare the four sets for one\nparticular value of \u03c38 in Fig. 4. For each grid of cosmologies and\nfor each choice as to whether to allow the parameters to vary we\nhave catalogues for each of our three models, and therefore in total\nwe have twelve sets of catalogues each of which has nine members\nlying on a regular grid in \u03c38 . The key to our numbering of these\nsets is given in Table 2.\nExamining Fig. 3, it is clear that some of our catalogues fit the\ndata better than others. For the higher \u03c38 cosmologies, the shape\nof the models fits that of the data rather well. The trend between\ncosmologies is consistent between the three GALFORM models: a\nhigher amplitude of clustering for higher \u03c38 , as expected. There\nare differences between the models, however, especially on small\n\nscales, which must arise from differences in the details of the halo\noccupation distribution predicted by the models.\nThe variation in the predicted correlation function between\ncosmologies, and the consistent trend between models, supports\nour hope that comparison to the SDSS correlation function can constrain \u03c38 . For each set of nine cosmologies, we calculate \u03c72 with\nrespect to the observed correlation function and its covariance matrix, then fit a quadratic through the three points around the minimum to interpolate and estimate the best-fitting \u03c38 and its 1-\u03c3 error.\nThe result of applying this procedure is given in Fig. 5. There, we\ngive an estimate of \u03c38 and its errors for each of our twelve different\nsets of populated simulations, as the black crosses and error bars.\nThe model number referred to on the x-axis is explained in Table 2.\nA few comments may be made about Fig. 5. Firstly, some of\nthe sets of models yielded no value of \u03c38 for which the simulated\ncorrelation function was an acceptable fit to the observed one. The\nlarge \u03c72 and \u2206\u03c72 values then result in a spuriously small error\nbar. This is the case for models 9, 11 and 12, so the constraints\ncoming from those models should be ignored. Secondly, recall that\nwe ran only two N -body simulations, using only the outputs given\nin Table 1. In fact, while one was run with a larger value for \u03c38\n(and therefore a smaller \u03a9M for an output with given \u03c38 ), it was\nstarted with initial conditions where the different Fourier modes\nof the density field were given the same phase as in the low-\u03c38\nsimulation. This means that the constraints from the different sets\nof synthetic galaxy catalogues are not independent, but should be\nused to give an indication of the systematic error arising from the\nchoice of semi-analytic model parameters and the assumed value\nof \u03a9M (which we do not constrain). Note that we have also plotted\ntwo constraints for each model in Fig. 5. On the left, with solid\nerror bars, are the constraints derived just as we have described.\nWe discuss the estimates on the right, with dashed error bars, in\nSection 3.3.1.\n\n\f8\n\nG. Harker et al.\n\nFigure 5. Constraints on \u03c38 . The x-axis shows the model number, the key\nto which is given in Table 2. The y-axis shows the 1\u03c3 constraint on \u03c38\nachieved in that particular model. The points with solid error bars are for\nthe unmodified catalogues. The points with dashed error bars show how\nthe constraints change when we make an empirical correction for the effect\nof halo assembly bias (Croton, Gao & White 2007, and references therein).\nWe do this by modifying the correlation function according to the scaledependent bias between shuffled and unshuffled GALFORM catalogues in\nthe Millennium Simulation, as described in Section 3.3.1.\n\n3.3 Other catalogues\n3.3.1 Halo assembly bias\nThe points with dashed error bars in Fig. 5 show a constraint after we attempt to correct our simulated correlation functions for\nthe effect of so-called 'halo assembly bias'. This is an effect that\nmay arise if one of the assumptions we make when populating our\nsimulation with galaxies is incorrect. We assume that the distribution from which the properties of the galaxy content of a halo\nare drawn depends only on the mass of the halo. In other words,\nsince the halo merger tree is the basic input to our semi-analytic\nmodel, we assume that the distribution from which the properties of a halo's merger tree are drawn depends only on halo mass.\nThis is explicitly the case for the Monte Carlo merger trees we use\nhere, since it is a result of the underlying extended Press-Schechter\ntheory (Press & Schechter 1974; Bower 1991; Bond et al. 1991;\nLacey & Cole 1993). This result was also supported by work on\nsimulations (Lemson & Kauffmann 1999). More recently, however, the advent of larger simulations with better resolution has allowed this result to be challenged. Gao, Springel & White (2005)\nshowed that old haloes of a given mass in the Millennium Simulation were more strongly clustered than young haloes of the\nsame mass, while Harker et al. (2006) demonstrated that halo formation time is a function of halo environment as well as halo\nmass using an independent set of merger trees in the same simulation. Because halo age is a property of the halo merger tree,\nthis shows that the assumption we have described is violated. In\nfact, the variation of N -body merger trees with environment has\nbeen studied in other large simulations (Maulbetsch et al. 2007).\nMore generally, this environmental dependence formally invali-\n\ndates the straightforward application of halo models of galaxy clustering (Benson et al. 2000; Seljak 2000; Berlind & Weinberg 2002;\nCooray & Sheth 2002). It has stimulated theoretical attempts to explain the departure from the extended Press-Schechter prediction\n(e.g., Sandvik et al. 2007; Wang, Mo & Jing 2007), and to look\nfor possible effects on the galaxy population both observationally\n(Yang, Mo & van den Bosch 2006) and in models (Croton et al.\n2007; Zhu et al. 2006).\nOur correlation functions are corrected using a GALFORM catalogue generated in the Millennium Simulation. The version of\nGALFORM which generates the catalogue takes as its input the actual N -body merger tree of each halo (Bower et al. 2006). This catalogue therefore incorporates environmentally dependent halo formation. In a similar spirit to Croton et al. (2007), we shuffle this\ncatalogue, assigning to each halo the galaxy population of a random halo of the same mass. This destroys any connection between\nthe environment of a halo of given mass and its galaxy population. We calculate the galaxy correlation function for a range of\ndifferent magnitude thresholds for both the original and shuffled\ncatalogues. This gives us an estimate of the effect of halo assembly\nbias, for GALFORM galaxies at least: we note that while our results\nare qualitatively consistent with those of Croton et al. (2007), the\ntwo semi-analytic models do not respond identically. We have calculated the scale-dependent ratio between the correlation functions,\nand then used this ratio (for a sample of appropriate space density)\nto correct the correlation functions used for our constraints. This\nis intended only to give an estimate of the size of the systematic\nerror on our constraints coming from halo assembly bias. As Fig. 5\nshows, the error from this source is small in comparison to the statistical errors, for our model at least.\n3.3.2 Luminosity dependence\nWe calculate the correlation length of the samples by fitting a power\nlaw to \u03be(r) for 2 < r/(h\u22121 Mpc) < 20; that is, we parametrize\nthe correlation function as \u03be(r) = (r/r0 )\u2212\u03b3 where r0 is the correlation length. We have done this for all our samples of all luminosities, so we are able to plot the correlation length as a function of\nsample space density (or, equivalently, as a function of sample luminosity threshold) in Fig. 6. The black line in the plots shows the\ncorresponding result from the SDSS. The SDSS data show a steady\nincrease in clustering strength with luminosity (i.e. with decreasing\nspace density) apart from a feature at n\u0304g \u2248 0.006 h3 Mpc\u22123 corresponding to the difference between two Mrmax = \u221220.0 samples: one has a large, overdense region at z \u223c 0.08 excised (see\nZehavi et al. 2005 for details) and has lower space density but, as\nmight be expected, weaker clustering than the sample where this\nregion is retained.\nFor many cosmologies, the Cole2000 model and the updated,\nhigher baryon fraction C2000hib model do a reasonable job of\nmatching the luminosity-dependent clustering in the SDSS, especially for samples of moderate to low space density. Model M,\nwhich invokes superwinds (see Section 2.2), does not do so well,\npredicting very little luminosity dependence. This may be because\nthe feedback effects are so extreme in large haloes that their central galaxies are little brighter (if at all) than those at the centre of\nless massive, less biased haloes. The other two models tend to have\nthe opposite problem in the brightest samples: they tend to predict\ntoo high an amplitude of clustering. This could be due to too tight\na relationship between halo mass and galaxy luminosity (perhaps\nbecause in reality feedback is more efficient or more stochastic):\nnone of the brightest galaxies is scattered into lower mass, less bi-\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\n\n9\n\nFigure 6. Correlation length as a function of sample space density for r-band selected galaxies, for the same set of models and with the same colour coding\nand line styles as Fig. 3.\n\nased haloes. A generic feature of the GALFORM models seems to\nbe an upturn in the clustering amplitude at high space density. This\nsuggests that too many of the faint galaxies generated by the model\nreside in high mass haloes. This may be related to the fact that it is\nhard to produce a luminosity function with a flat enough faint-end\nslope, the excess of faint galaxies perhaps consisting of satellites in\nmassive haloes.\nClearly, matching the luminosity-dependent clustering of\ngalaxies will continue to be a very stringent test for semi-analytic\nmodels. Even if the models were provided with the correct cosmology as an input, matching the clustering would still seem to\nrequire that the models predict the correct galaxy population for\nhaloes as a function of luminosity and mass, rather than predicting\nquantities which implicitly average over a range of halo mass, such\nas the (unconditional) galaxy luminosity function. Conversely, if\n\nthe models were able to correctly capture the trends of luminosity\ndependent clustering, it would give us more confidence that they\nwere predicting realistic galaxy populations on a halo-by-halo basis, and give a firmer foundation for attempts to constrain cosmology with methods involving semi-analytic catalogues. Though we\nbear this in mind, it seems unrealistic to require a perfect and complete model of galaxy formation before considering the information\nit can provide us on cosmological parameters.\nThe models display a minimum in clustering strength at\nroughly the space density of the sample we use for our constraint.\nWe might therefore expect that using a sample of different space\ndensity may yield a lower estimate for \u03c38 than the sample we\nhave used above. In fact when we attempt to constrain \u03c38 using\ndifferent samples, we obtain high values of \u03c72 for all cosmologies, even for those which appear by eye to be acceptable fits,\n\n\f10\n\nG.

This prevents the\njackknife method from fully capturing the variance in the density\nfield.\n\nOne might worry that the supercluster at z \u223c 0.08 (mentioned\nabove) affects our constraints. Zehavi et al. (2005) note, however,\nthat in their analysis it has no effect on samples fainter than their\nMr \u2212 5 log10 h < \u221220.0 sample, while removing it has a very\nsmall effect on brighter samples, producing a negligible drop in\nwp (rp ). If the drop were larger, then using samples without this region removed could bias our estimate of \u03c38 upwards. More likely,\nthe supercluster may cause a slight underestimate of the size of our\n\nWe have chosen to use the (r-band selected) SDSS rather than the\n(bJ -band selected) 2dFGRS for our main constraint on \u03c38 , since\nthe prediction for the luminosity of galaxies in bluer bands depends\nmore heavily on recent star formation. It therefore tends to be more\nmodel-dependent than the prediction for redder bands, where there\nis a larger dependence on total stellar mass. None the less, the 2dFGRS provides very valuable data on galaxy clustering, and an accurate galaxy formation model should give constraints on \u03c38 which\n\n3.3.3 Constraints from the 2dFGRS\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\nare consistent between the two datasets. In addition, the analysis\nof satellite fractions in the 2dFGRS by van den Bosch et al. (2005)\nsuggested, if somewhat indirectly, that the 2dF data prefer a relatively low \u03c38 . In a similar spirit to the analysis we perform here,\nthis constraint on \u03c38 came about independently of other datasets.\nIt may therefore be interesting to see whether our relatively high\nvalue of \u03c38 coming from galaxy clustering data alone is driven by\nthe data (in which case our estimate for \u03c38 when using 2dFGRS\ndata should be consistent with theirs) or by other factors. Note, for\nexample, that Pan & Szapudi (2005) quote a high preferred value\nfor \u03c38 in their 2dFGRS clustering analysis \u2013 albeit concentrating\non the three-point function \u2013 though their error bar extends to low\nvalues, \u03c38 = 0.93+0.06\n\u22120.2 .\nThe 2dFGRS clustering data we use are an updated version of\nthe analysis of Norberg et al. (2001, 2002) (Norberg et al., in prep.).\nThis is the same dataset as used by Tinker et al. (2007) in their\nstudy of the luminosity dependence of the galaxy pairwise velocity\ndispersion. We compare the sample with MbJ \u2212 5 log10 h < \u221218\nto corresponding catalogues from our models in Fig. 7. The grid of\nmodels used is the same as for Fig. 3, but we select samples using a bJ magnitude threshold so as to match the space density of\nthe 2dF sample. The threshold is chosen so that the space density,\n0.00249 h3 Mpc\u22123 , is similar to that of our main SDSS sample.\nThe model clustering appears to depend more weakly on cosmology than for the r-selected samples, but there is still a clear trend\nand so we would hope still to be able to use these data to estimate\n\u03c38 .\nWe calculate \u03c72 between the data and the model using a\nprincipal component analysis, again ignoring the errors on the\nmodel correlation functions as we did for the SDSS. This analysis is performed on the dimensionless projected correlation function, wp (rp )/rp , denoted \u039e(\u03c3)/\u03c3 by Norberg et al. (2002). We use\nonly the first six principal components, which account for over 99\nper cent of the variance. Statistical errors in the estimate of the\nprincipal components dominate the contribution to \u03c72 of the less\nsignificant components. This illustrates the problems which would\narise if we instead used the whole covariance matrix, as highlighted\nin Section 3.3.2.\nThe resulting constraints on \u03c38 are given in Fig. 8. The model\nnumbering is the same as for Fig. 5, and is given in Table 2. Noting\nthe change in axis scale from Fig. 5, we see that the statistical error\non \u03c38 from the 2dF sample is comparable to that from the SDSS.\nWhile most of the grids of models yield \u03c38 estimates similar to\nthose obtained from the SDSS (if perhaps a little lower), there are\nseveral model grids which give significantly lower values of \u03c38 for\nthe bJ -selected samples than they did for the r-selected ones. In\nfact, these grids (numbers 1, 4 and 10) all use the C2000hib model.\nOur results therefore suggest that in this model the blue galaxies\nare more clustered than in the others, and hence lower dark matter\nclustering is required to match the observational result. This may be\nbecause the feedback excessively reddens isolated galaxies, leaving a larger proportion of the bluer galaxies in more massive, more\nclustered haloes. In any case it supports the idea that the clustering of model galaxies selected in bluer wavebands may be more\ndependent on the semi-analytic prescription.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nAs we note in Section 3.2, the constraints from the 12 different sets\nof catalogues in Fig. 5 are not independent, since the underlying N body simulations in each case were seeded with the same phases.\n\n11\n\nFigure 8. Constraints on \u03c38 for the 2dF sample. The model numbering is\nthe same as for Fig. 5 and is given in Table 2.\n\nThis does, though, mean that we can use the scatter between the\ncatalogues to estimate the systematic error in the constraint arising from our choice of semi-analytic prescription. While we only\nhave three different models (along with variants in which we do not\ntweak the parameters to match the r-band luminosity function), we\ncan see that they differ quite strongly in the luminosity dependence\n(Fig. 3) and colour dependence (Fig. 8) of their clustering. They\nmay, then, be representative of the scatter we can expect between\nGALFORM models that fit the r-band luminosity function and the\nprimary constraints listed in Section 2.2. From the range of \u223c 0.07\nin the value of the best-fitting \u03c38 between sets of catalogues, we\nestimate a systematic error from this source of \u00b10.04. The average size of the statistical error bars among the catalogues for which\nthe best-fitting \u03c38 was a good fit in a \u03c72 sense suggests a statistical error of, again \u00b10.04. Adding these in errors in quadrature to\nthe mean of the best-fitting values in these catalogues gives a final\nfigure of \u03c38 = 0.97 \u00b1 0.06 for the r-band samples.\nWithin the scope of the parameter variations we investigated,\nif we assume that \u03c38 = 0.8 then none of our models gives us a good\nfit to the SDSS clustering over the full range of scales. This does not\npreclude the possibility that models that do not fit the luminosity\nfunction, or that include different physics to our particular semianalytic model, may achieve such a fit.\nOur value for \u03c38 is clearly at odds with the most striking recent measurement, from the three-year WMAP data. Using\nthose data alone, Spergel et al. (2007) quote \u03c38 = 0.761+0.049\n\u22120.048\nfor flat, power-law \u039bCDM, and this value is not significantly increased (though the error bars tighten) when the data are analysed jointly with galaxy clustering or supernova data. There is,\nthough, some tension between the WMAP result and results from\nweak lensing surveys, which provide rather complementary parameter constraints (Tereno et al. 2005). Spergel et al.'s joint analysis of WMAP and the CFHTLS lensing survey (Hoekstra et al.\n2006; Semboloni et al. 2006) pulls their estimate up to \u03c38 =\n0.827+0.026\n\u22120.025 , with the lensing data alone favouring even higher values. Benjamin et al. (2007) have combined data from the CFHTLS\n\n\f12\n\nG. Harker et al.\n\nand other surveys to give \u03c38 (\u03a9M /0.24)0.59 = 0.84 \u00b1 0.07.\nLyman-\u03b1 forest data can be used to constrain the power spectrum;\nSeljak, Makarov, McDonald et al. (2005) quote \u03c38 = 0.90 \u00b1 0.03\n(reducing to 0.84 incorporating the new constraints on reionization\nfrom the three-year WMAP data). Measurements of cluster abundance have frequently been used to constrain \u03c38 , but provide a very\nwide range of estimates because of the difficuly in relating the properties of an observed cluster to its mass (e.g., Rasia et al. 2005).\nRecent estimates are, though, consistent with the WMAP determination of \u03c38 (e.g., Pierpaoli et al. 2003).\nThe overall picture of the value of \u03c38 from other methods is\ntherefore a little confusing, but even the highest recent estimates are\nonly marginally consistent with ours. A possible source of tension\nbetween our constraints and those from WMAP is that we have\nassumed a spectral index ns = 1, while the best-fitting WMAP \u03c38\nis quoted for their best-fitting ns of approximately 0.95. As one\ncan see from the lower right panel of figure 10 of Spergel et al.\n(2007), the constraints on these two parameters are correlated. Even\nso, increasing ns to unity would only correspond to an increase in\n\u03c38 of 0.1, which is not enough to eliminate the discrepancy with\nour result. A further complication is that the size of ns is not the\nonly difference in the initial P (k) between the WMAP three-year\nconstraints and our model. Though ideally one might like to repeat\nour tests using the power spectrum shape inferred by Spergel et al.\n(2007), we note that despite some parameter changes from the firstyear WMAP constraints, the net change in the power spectrum is\nsmall. Furthermore, other datasets that are less dependent on ns\nalso prefer a lower \u03c38 than we do, so even were we to infer a higher\n\u03c38 from the CMB than currently favoured, our problems would not\nbe solved.\nAs far as using galaxy data alone goes, methods involving\nhigher-order correlations, particularly the three-point correlation\nfunction (or its Fourier counterpart the bispectrum) are promising,\nfor example because of their ability to constrain galaxy bias. The\naddition of dynamical information, for example redshift space distortions or the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) can also help\nconstrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. An analysis\nincluding PVD information in the conditional luminosity function\n(CLF) approach, by Yang et al. (2004, 2005), suggested relatively\nlow values of \u03c38 , though this was inferred from their models with\nhigh \u03c38 since low-\u03c38 simulations were not explicitly analysed. Results from halo occupation (HOD) modelling, an approach perhaps\nmore akin to ours \u2013 for example the analysis of the cluster massto-light ratio by Tinker et al. (2005) \u2013 have tended also to favour a\nlow \u03c38 . Zheng & Weinberg (2007), and references therein, provide\na detailed explanation of HOD modelling and its use in constraining parameters using galaxy data alone.\nAn alternative approach using the 2dFGRS is employed by\nvan den Bosch et al. (2005). They study the abundance and radial\ndistribution of satellite galaxies within the CLF framework, using mock galaxy catalogues produced by a semi-analytic code to\ncalibrate their model. This calibration quantifies the impact of the\ninevitable imperfections in the halo finder that lead to satellite\ngalaxies being spuriously identified as central galaxies of separate\nhaloes, and vice versa. It also accounts for incompleteness effects\nin the 2dFGRS. Their results are consistent with other CLF analyses in suggesting that simultaneously matching the observed cluster\nmass-to-light ratio and the fraction of satellite galaxies in the 2dFGRS requires a low value of \u03c38 , lowering the abuundance of very\nmassive haloes with a great number of satellites. Again, they do not\ndirectly construct mock galaxy redshift surveys for a low \u03c38 model,\nbut using the same calibration parameters as for their \u03c38 = 0.9\n\nmodel leads them to believe that adopting \u03c38 = 0.7 provides a\nbetter fit to the data.\nThe parameters of the conditional luminosity functions which\nvan den Bosch et al. (2005) use to fit the 2dFGRS data for low and\nhigh \u03c38 are tabulated in their paper. We have used these parameters\nto construct the corresponding mean occupation functions \u2013 that is,\nthe mean number of galaxies in a halo of given mass \u2013 then used\nthese functions to populate the Millennium Simulation, and outputs\nof our Run 1 having \u03c38 = 0.7 and \u03c38 = 0.9. This is done as follows: for each halo in the simulation, we look up the mean number\nof galaxies in a halo of this mass, hN (M )i. If hN i 6 1 the halo\nreceives either a single, central galaxy (with probability hN i) or no\ngalaxies at all (with probability 1 \u2212 hN i). If hN i > 1 then the halo\nreceives a central galaxy, plus a number of satellite galaxies drawn\nfrom a Poisson distribution with mean hN i \u2212 1. The use of these\nprobability distributions follows the work of Kravtsov et al. (2004)\nand Zheng et al. (2005); in addition, the halo occupation distribution of GALFORM galaxies in our models is consistent with this\nscheme. Once we know the number of galaxies in a given halo, we\nthen place the galaxies according to the scheme described in Section 2.3.\nWe find that the mean occupation functions look reasonable,\nthough in some cases they are not quite monotonic, and do not generally exhibit so clean a 'step function + power law' form as the\nGALFORM mean occupation functions. In our approach to populating simulations with the CLF HODs, we do not assign a luminosity\nto each galaxy, and so we construct a different catalogue for each\nmagnitude threshold we wish to analyse. The space density of these\ncatalogues as a function of magnitude gives us a cumulative luminosity function, and we have checked that this matches the 2dFGRS bJ -band luminosity function for the \u03c38 = 0.9 catalogue, as it\nshould by construction. For \u03c38 = 0.7, the CLF catalogues give too\nsteep a faint-end slope of the luminosity function, so that strictly\nspeaking the CLF is incorrect, though this should not be a concern\nfor galaxies of the luminosity we use for our clustering analysis.\nWe also find that the CLF produces clustering consistent with our\nbJ -selected GALFORM samples.\nThe similar clustering in the GALFORM and CLF catalogues\nraises the question of what drives the difference in preferred \u03c38 .\nThe similarity between values from our SDSS and 2dF analyses\nsuggests it is not driven entirely by the data. Moreover, it seems at\nodds with the conclusions of Tinker, Weinberg & Warren (2006),\nwho show that in their HOD model the projected correlation function tightly constrains the satellite fraction. The answer may lie in\nthe fact that their parametrized HOD, and our semi-analytic HOD,\nare unable to match the form of the mean occupation functions produced by the CLF approach, in which the parametrizations adopted\nfor different parts of the CLF are a few steps removed from HOD\nparameters.\nIt would be exciting to conclude that our results support a real\ndifference between low-redshift estimates of \u03c38 (e.g. from weak\nlensing) and estimates using CMB data, and that this indicates\nsomething about, say, evolving dark energy. Other analyses find\nlower values, though, and there are still one or two concerns about\nour constraints. The mean occupation functions from our high \u03a9M ,\nlow \u03c38 GALFORM runs tend to be more ragged, perhaps indicating a difficulty with our modelling in these cosmologies. While we\nhave checked that galaxy samples selected in a different waveband\ngive similar results, the anomalous C2000hib model gives some\ncause for concern. Similarly, while samples with a different magnitude threshold appear to give consistent results, the luminosity dependence of clustering differs between models. These samples also\n\n\fConstraints on \u03c38 from simulations\nhave smaller effective volume which seems to give rise to problems\nin the error analysis.\nAs we hoped, a large part of our constraint comes from the\nintermediate-scale clustering for which halo-based models are most\nnecessary, but this is affected by the scheme for placing galaxies\nwithin haloes. The largest difference between our high and low \u03c38\nmodels (and between our low \u03c38 models and the data) is manifested\nat small scales. The radial distribution of satellite galaxies within\nhaloes is again different in the GALFORM model of Bower et al.\n(2006) which uses N -body substructure data, and this is clearly an\narea of galaxy formation modelling which requires further attention. We have repeated our analysis of the SDSS data using only\npoints with rp > 2 h\u22121 M pc. While the best-fitting value of \u03c38\ndecreases by approximately six per cent to \u223c 0.91, the error bars\napproximately double in size, illustrating the importance of making\nuse of smaller scales.\nWhile bearing the above caveats in mind, we would like to emphasize the tight constraints available in principle using our technique, and to note that the results presented here are consistent (if\nmarginally) with some other analyses which use only low-redshift\ndata. If the tightness of the constraints seems surprising, consider\nfirstly that in the absence of uncertainty about galaxy bias, the constraints would be extremely tight as the amplitude of the correlation function is very well determined. Secondly, by comparing\nmodel galaxies to real galaxies of the same abundance, we factor out most of the dependence on the details of the semi-analytic\nmodel. Any change that makes galaxies monotonically brighter or\nfainter will have no effect on our comparison between models and\ndata. Thirdly, the number of galaxies assigned to each halo in the\nsemi-analytic model is principally determined by the merger history of that halo, and this is well described by the extended PressSchechter theory. Hence this is not a major uncertainty in the semianalytic models: unlike purely statistical descriptions as provided\nby the HOD or CLF, our semi-analytic models do not have the freedom to define arbitrary HODs. These are instead largely determined\nby the merger trees.\nWe also remark that other constraints using galaxy data alone,\nwhich at first sight seem inconsistent with ours, use different techniques or different data or both. These inconsistencies arise even\nthough galaxy formation models can reproduce statistics which implicitly average over a range of halo mass \u2013 such as the unconditional galaxy luminosity function \u2013 reasonably well. This illustrates\nthat matching the luminosity- and colour-dependence of clustering,\nat small and large scales, is an important and very stringent requirement on galaxy formation models.\n\n13\n\neach of these variants we generate a catalogue in which the GAL 0.1\nFORM parameters are adjusted to match the SDSS\nr-band luminosity function and a catalogue in which the parameters take the\nsame values as they take in the (\u03a9M , \u03c38 ) = (0.3, 0.8) cosmology.\nWe obtain the result \u03c38 = 0.97 \u00b1 0.04(statistical) \u00b10.04 (systematic). This constraint is impressively tight, given we have attempted\nto narrow the range of assumptions we require to produce an estimate of \u03c38 by using only one well understood, low redshift dataset.\nBy choosing grids of cosmologies which lie on cluster-normalized\ncurves, \u03c38 \u03a90.5\nM = const. we have shown that the degeneracies inherent in our approach are different to those inherent in cosmic\nshear measurements, which provide an important low redshift constraint in \u03a9M and \u03c38 . In fact our method gives an almost pure constraint on \u03c38 . We have shown that in our model, halo assembly bias\ndoes not severely affect our constraint on \u03c38 , though this may not\nbe universally the case for other semi-analytic codes. If it were not\nthe case, we would expect it to bias our estimate of \u03c38 high, since\nfailing to account for halo assembly bias tends to lower the amplitude of model correlation functions, requiring an increased \u03c38 in\nthe model to compensate.\nWe obtain similar values for \u03c38 if we use samples with a lower\nor higher galaxy space density, but the error analysis is less secure.\nWe also obtain similar values using a principal component analysis\nof 2dFGRS data, for a sample of similar space density to that used\nfor our primary constraint. We note, though, that the clustering of\ngalaxies selected in bluer wavebands appears to be more modeldependent, as one might expect.\nOur estimate of \u03c38 looks high compared to the values obtained\nby many recent measurements, in particular those from the WMAP\nexperiment. While we note that this tension has some interesting\nconsequences if it persists, we have also pointed out how apparent inconsistencies between our results and other low redshift constraints may arise. Small and intermediate scales in the correlation\nfunctions contribute strongly to \u03c72 and hence to our constraint on\n\u03c38 , and yet are not as well understood as the large scales. This is\nclearly an area where further modelling effort is required. Moreover, we will not be completely assured that semi-analytic models\ncapture the phenomenology of the galaxy population sufficiently\nwell for high precision cosmological constraints until they are able\nto match the observed colour- and luminosity-dependent clustering\nof galaxies. The models need to be able to reproduce the properties of the observed galaxy population on a halo-by-halo basis, not\njust the properties averaged spatially or over luminosity. This implies that if cosmological parameters can be tightly constrained by\nother techniques, measurements of galaxy clustering will continue\nto provide stringent tests for models of galaxy formation.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have compared the SDSS projected two-point correlation function at a galaxy space density n\u0304g = 0.00308 h3 Mpc\u22123 to a suite\nof populated simulations generated using the N -body code GAD GET 2 and the semi-analytic code GALFORM . Because we require\nN -body data in a great number of different cosmologies, we have\nrelabelled and rescaled some simulation outputs using the techniques of Zheng et al. (2002) to avoid the need to run a full simulation for each cosmology in our grid. The galaxy catalogues are\nself-consistent, GALFORM being run afresh for each cosmology we\nstudy.\nWe have attempted to estimate the systematic error in our\nvalue of \u03c38 due to the particular choice of semi-analytic model by\nrunning three different GALFORM variants in each cosmology.
