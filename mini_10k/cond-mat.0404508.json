In this context the dynamics of\ncomplex systems driven by weak noise, corresponding to rare events, is of particular interest. The issue of different\ntime scales does in fact characterize many interesting processes in nature. For instance, in the case of chemical\nreactions the reaction time is often orders of magnitude larger than the molecular vibration periods [1]. The time\nscale separation problem is also encountered in the case of conformational changes of biomolecules, nucleation events\nduring phase transitions, switching of the magnetization in magnetic materials [2, 3], and even in the case of comets\nexhibiting rapid transitions between heliocentric orbits around Jupiter [4].\nThe weak noise limit, characterizing the time scale separation, is associated with the strong coupling regime, and\nthe problem of determining kinetic pathways and transition probabilities between metastable states in systems with\nmany degrees of freedom presents one of the most important and challenging tasks in many areas of physics [5]. The\nlong time scales are associated with the separation in energy scales of the thermal energy and the energy barriers\nbetween metastable states; the transition takes place by sudden jumps between metastable states followed by long\nwaiting times in the vicinity of the states. The fundamental issue is thus the determination of transition pathways\nand the associated transition rates.\nIn the weak noise limit the standard Monte Carlo method or direct simulation of the Langevin equation becomes\nimpractical owing to the large separation of time scales and alternative methods have been developed. The most\nnotable analytical approach is the formulation due to Freidlin and Wentzel which yields the transition probabilities\nin terms of an action functional [6]. This approach is the analogue of the variational principle proposed by Machlup\nand Onsager [7, 8], see also work by Graham et al. [9, 10]. The Freidlin-Wentzel approach is equivalent to the\nMartin-Siggia-Rose method [11] in the weak noise limit of the path integral formulation [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In order\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: fogedby@phys.au.dk\naddress: hertz@nordita.dk\n\u2021 Electronic address: svane@phys.au.dk\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nto overcome the time scale gap various numerical methods have also been proposed. We mention here the transition\npath sampling method [17] and optimization techniques [18, 19].\nA particularly interesting non-equilibrium problem of relevance in the nanophysics of switches is the influence of\nthermal noise on two-level systems with spatial degrees of freedom, see Refs. [2, 3, 20] . In a recent paper by E, Ren,\nand Vanden-Eijden [21], see also Ref. [19], this problem has been addressed using the Ginzburg-Landau equation\ndriven by thermal noise. Applying the field theoretic version of the Onsager-Machlup functional [7, 8] in the FreidlinWentzell formulation [6], these authors implement a powerful numerical optimization techniques for the determination\nof the space-time configuration minimizing the Freidlin-Wentzell action and in this way determine the kinetic pathways\nand their associated action, yielding the switching probabilities in the long time-low temperature limit. The picture\nthat emerges from this numerical study is that of noise-induced nucleation and subsequent propagation of domain\nwalls across the sample, giving rise to the switch between metastable states.\nIn recent work we have addressed a related problem in non-equilibrium physics, namely the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nequation or equivalent noisy Burgers equation describing, for example, a growing interface in a random environment.\nUsing a canonical phase space method derived from the weak noise limit of the Martin-Siggia-Rose functional or\ndirectly from the Fokker-Planck equation, we have, in the one dimensional case, analyzed the coupled field equations\nminimizing the action both analytically [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] and numerically [28]. The picture that emerges is that\nthe transition probabilities in the weak noise limit are associated with soliton propagation and nucleation resulting\nfrom soliton collisions.\nIn the present paper we apply the canonical phase space approach to the noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation discussed\nby E, Ren, and Vanden-Eijden [21] and attempt to account for some of their numerical findings. We thus give\nanalytical arguments for the propagation of noise-induced solitons and the nucleation events originating from soliton\nannihilation and creation. The paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II we introduce the noisy GinzburgLandau equation. In Sec. III we review the canonical phase space approach. In Sec. IV we discuss diffusive mode\nand domain wall solutions of the field equations replacing the noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation. In Sec. V we analyze\nthe domain wall dynamics. In Sec. VI we present a stochastic interpretation of our results. In Sec. VII we discuss\nequilibrium properties and kinetic transitions. In Sec. VIII we present an interpretation of the numerical results\nobtained by the optimization studies of E et. al [21]. Sec. IX is devoted to a summary and a conclusion. A brief\nversion of the present work has appeared in Ref. [29].\nII.\n\nTHE NOISY GINZBURG - LANDAU MODEL\n\nThe noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation driven by white noise has the form\n\u2202u\n\u03b4F\n= \u2212\u0393\n+ \u03b7,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the locally correlated Gaussian white noise is specified by the moment\nh\u03b7(x, t)\u03b7(0, 0)i = \u2206\u03b4(x)\u03b4(t),\nwith noise strength parameter \u2206. The free energy F providing the deterministic drive is given by\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\nZ\n\u2202u\n1\n+ V (u) .\ndx\nF =\n2\n\u2202x\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn the switching problem considered by E et al. [21] the double well potential V (u) has the form\nV (u) = k02 (1 \u2212 u(x)2 )2 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith strength parameter k0 . The potential vanishes at the two minima u \u00b1 1 and assumes the maximum value\nV (0) = k02 at u = 0. The time scale is set by the kinetic transport coefficient \u0393 and the dimensionless scalar field\nu determines the spatial and temporal state of the switch. The \"Mexican hat\" double well potential is depicted in\nFig. 1\nThe Ginzburg-Landau equation in its deterministic form has been used both in the context of phase ordering\nkinetics [30] and in its complex form in the study of pattern formation [31]. In the noisy case for a finite system the\nequation has been studied in [32]; see also an analysis of the related \u03c64 theory in [33]. In the present problem the\nnoisy equation provides a generalization of the classical Kramers problem [5] to spatially extended systems.\nBy inspection of Eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) we note that k0 has the dimension of an inverse length, \u0393 the dimension\nof length squared over time, and \u2206 the dimension of velocity. For large k0 , which is the case considered here, and\n\n\f3\n\nV(u)\n2\n\nk0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nu\n\nFIG. 1: We depict the double-well potential defining the unperturbed states of the switch. The potential has minima at u = \u00b11\nand a maximum at u = 0.\n\nfor \u03b7 = 0 the potential term dominates the diffusive term and the field u locks on to the values \u00b11 in bulk; imposed\nboundary values being accommodated over a saturation or healing length of order k0\u22121 . In the presence of noise the\nminima become unstable to thermal fluctuations and the noise can drive the system over the potential barrier.\nThe Ginzburg-Landau equation (2.1) admits a fluctuation-dissipation theorem yielding the stationary distribution\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\u0393\nPstat \u221d exp \u2212 F .\n(2.5)\n\u2206\nIn a thermal environment at temperature T we have \u2206 = 2\u0393T (in units such that kB = 1) and Pstat \u221d exp[\u2212F/T ],\ni.e., the Boltzmann distribution. The equilibrium states follow from the condition\n\u03b4F\n= \u2212\u22072 u \u2212 2k02 u(1 \u2212 u2 ) = 0,\n\u03b4u\n\n(2.6)\n\nyielding two degenerate uniform ground states u = \u00b11 with free energy F = 0, as well as two nonuniform domain\nwall solutions\nudw (x) = \u00b1 tanh k0 (x \u2212 x0 ),\n\n(2.7)\n\ncentered at x0 and of width k0\u22121 . For large |x| the domain wall solutions overlap with the uniform ground state\nsolutions u = \u00b11. The associated domain wall free energy is\nFdw = 4k0 /3.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe minima, maxima, and saddle point structure of the complex energy landscape of F as a functional of {u(x)} are\ninferred from the spectrum of the differential operator\n\u03b42F\n= \u2212\u22072 \u2212 2k02 (1 \u2212 3u2 ).\n\u03b4u2\n\n(2.9)\n\nFor the ground states u = \u00b11 the spectrum of \u03b4 2 F/\u03b4u2 is given by the plane wave mode \u223c exp(ikx) with positive\neigenvalues k 2 + 4k02 . For a single domain wall configuration or n connected domain walls the spectrum is composed of zero-eigenvalue translation modes (Goldstone modes) and superimposed phase shifted plane wave modes\n\u223c exp[ikx) exp(i\u03c6) with positive eigenvalues k 2 + 4k02 , see e.g. Ref. [34]. We thus infer that the free energy landscape\npossesses two global minima at u = \u00b11 and a series of local saddle points of free energy 4nk0 /3, corresponding to n\nconnected domain walls at positions xi , i = 1, 2, * * * n. In Fig. 2 we have depicted a static 3-domain wall configuration\nconnecting the ground states u = \u22121 and u = +1 with free energy 4k0 . The static single domain wall or multi-domain\nwall configurations correspond to points in the free energy landscape F = F ({u(x)}) and cannot effectuate a switch\nbetween the ground state configurations u = \u00b11. However, in the presence of noise the Kramers escape mechanism\nsets in and the system can perform a kinetic transition. The transition probability is typically characterized by an\nArrhenius factor P \u223c exp[\u2212\u0393\u03b4F/\u2206] where \u03b4F is the free energy associated with the potential barriers encountered in\nthe dynamic transition, see e.g. [5]. In order to address this issue for the noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation we apply\nthe canonical phase space approach.\n\n\f4\n\nu\n+1\nx\nx1\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 2: We depict a static 3-domain wall configuration connecting the ground states u = \u22121 and u = +1. The domain walls\nare located at x1 , x2 , and x3 . The configuration corresponds to a saddle point in the free energy landscape and has free energy\n4k0 .\n\nIII.\n\nTHE CANONICAL PHASE SPACE APPROACH\n\nThe canonical phase space approach is discussed in detail in [28, 35]. Briefly, the Fokker-Planck equation for the\nprobability distribution P ({u(x)}, t) has the general form\n\u2206\n\n\u2202P\n= HP,\n\u2202t\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith formal solution P \u221d exp[Ht/\u2206]. The Fokker-Planck equation (3.1) is driven by the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian H(u, \u03b4/\u03b4u) (a differential-functional operator in u(x) space). The method is based on a weak noise WKB-like\napproximation\n\u0015\n\u0014\nS\n,\n(3.2)\nP \u221d exp \u2212\n\u2206\napplied to Eq. (3.1). To leading order in the noise strength \u2206 the action S satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\n\u2202S\n+ H(p, u) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(3.3)\n\nwith canonical momentum p = \u03b4S/\u03b4u, defining the Hamiltonian H as a functional of u and p and implying a principle\nof least action. The variational principle \u03b4S = 0, moreover, implies the Hamiltonian field equations of motion\n\u2202u\n\u03b4H\n=\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4p\n\u03b4H\n\u2202p\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n\nand the action\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u2202u\n\u2212\ndxdt p\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\ndt H.\n\n(3.6)\n\nApplying this scheme to the Ginzburg-Landau equation (2.1) we obtain\n\u2202u\n\u03b4F\n= \u2212\u0393\n+ p,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\n\u03b42F\n\u2202p\n= \u0393 2 p,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\ndriven by the Hamiltonian (the generator of time translations)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03b4F\nH = dx H =\n,\ndx p p \u2212 2\u0393\n2\n\u03b4u\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n\n\f5\nwith \u03b4F/\u03b4u and \u03b4 2 F/\u03b4u2 given by Eqs. (2.6) and (2.9). As a result the action S associated with an orbit from u1 to\nu2 traversed in time T is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ u2 ,T\n\u2202u\nS(u1 , u2 , T ) =\ndxdt p\n\u2212H ,\n(3.10)\n\u2202t\nu1 ,0\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian density. In our further analysis we shall also make use of the total momentum \u03a0 (the\ngenerator of space translations)\nZ\n\u2202p\n(3.11)\n\u03a0 = dx u .\n\u2202x\nThe prescription for determining the relevant Arrhenius factor associated with a transition and the kinetic pathway\nis thus straightforward. Fixing boundary values in space and time the first step is to solve the coupled field equations\n(3.7) and (3.8) for an orbit (a minimizer in the terminology of Ref. [21]) from u1 to u2 traversed in time T , next we\nevaluate the action S along an orbit according to Eq. (3.10), and finally deduce the transition probability from Eq.\n(3.2).\nThe correspondence with the equivalent Freidlin-Wentzel action SFW is obtained\nby inserting the equation\nof motion\nR\nR\n(3.7) and the Hamiltonian (3.9) in the action (3.10), yielding S = (1/2) dxdtp2 or SFW = (1/2) dxdt(\u2202u/\u2202t +\n\u0393\u03b4F/\u03b4u)2 . The Freidlin-Wentzel method is a Lagrangian configuration space method with Lagrangian density L =\n(1/2)(\u2202u/\u2202t + \u0393\u03b4F/\u03b4u)2 , whereas the present approach is a phase space formulation with action (3.10). We also note\nthat the equations of motion (3.7) and (3.8) are identical to the saddle point equations in the Martin-Siggia-Rose\nfunctional formulation [11, 14].\nIV.\n\nDIFFUSIVE MODE AND DOMAIN WALL SOLUTIONS\n\nMore explicitly, inserting \u03b4F/\u03b4u and \u03b4 2 F/\u03b4u2 from Eqs. (2.6) and (2.9) the equations of motion (3.7) and (3.8)\nassume the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202 2u\n= \u0393 2 + 2\u0393k02 u(1 \u2212 u2 ) + p,\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202 2p\n\u2202p\n= \u2212\u0393 2 \u2212 2\u0393k02 p(1 \u2212 3u2 ),\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\nand the Hamiltonian is\n1\nH=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 2u\n2\n2\ndxp p + 2\u0393 2 + 4\u0393k0 u(1 \u2212 u ) .\n\u2202x\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe equations of motion (4.1) and (4.2) determine orbits in a multi-dimensional phase space {u(x), p(x)} lying on\nthe energy manifolds determined by Eq. (4.3); for open or periodic boundary conditions the orbits are moreover\nconfined by the conservation of the total momentum \u03a0 given by Eq. (3.11). From an analytical point of view the\nfield equations (4.1) and (4.2) are in general intractable. Even numerically, the negative diffusion term in Eq. (4.2)\nrenders the coupled equations highly unstable as was noted in the numerical analysis of the Burgers equation [28].\nA.\n\nLinear diffusive modes\n\nIt is instructive first to consider the easily discussed linear case of simple diffusion for small k0 .

The finite time orbit from u1k to u2k lies on the energy manifold\nEk = p\u2217k [pk \u2212 2\u0393k2 uk ]. In the long time limit T \u2192 \u221e the orbits migrate to the transient manifold pk = 0 (I) and the stationary\nmanifold pk = 2\u0393k2 uk (II) passing through the saddle point (uk , pk ) = (0, 0) (SP) implying ergodicity and a stationary state.\n\nR\nR\nIn Fourier space, setting uk = dx exp (\u2212ikx)u and pk = dx exp(\u2212ikx)p, u\u2217k = u\u2212k and p\u2217k = p\u2212k , the equations\nof motion decompose and we arrive at the orbit solution, see Ref.

In the long time limit T \u2192 \u221e the orbits\nmigrate to the zero-energy manifolds consisting of the transient submanifold pk = 0 and the stationary submanifold\npk = 2\u0393k 2 uk , and pass asymptotically through the hyperbolic fixed point at (uk , pk ) = (0, 0), determining the\nstationary state. In Fig. 3 we have shown the orbits for a particular k-mode in a plot of pk versus uk .\nFinally, the conserved momentum \u03a0 and the action S follow from Eqs.

Invoking the fluctuation-dissipation theorem we then obtain an\nequilibrium distribution given by the Boltzmann factor exp(\u2212F/T ), \u2206 = 2\u0393T , consistent with Eq. (4.14).\nIn summary, in the linear purely diffusive case the configurations u(x, t) decompose into independent k-modes.\nIn the dynamical phase space approach the noise \u03b7k driving the individual k-modes is replaced by the noise field\npk which couples parametrically to the time evolution of the uk mode. In a transient time regime uk is damped\naccording to the diffusion equation and the orbit in phase space lies close to the transient or noiseless submanifold\npk = 0 and approaches the saddle point (uk , pk ) = (0, 0). At longer times the growing noise field pk drives uk away\nfrom the saddle point and the orbit approaches the stationary or noisy submanifold pk = 2\u0393k 2 uk , i.e., the distribution\nassociated with the noise-driven diffusion equation approaches a stationary distribution. In the limit T \u2192 \u221e the\norbit passes asymptotically through the saddle point and the orbit from u1k to u2k lies on the zero-energy manifolds\ndetermining the stationary state.\nB.\n\nDomain wall modes\n\nIn the nonlinear case the phase space representation of the noise-driven Ginzburg Landau equation is given by the\ncoupled field equations (4.1) and (4.2) determining the orbits. As in the linear case we can identify the zero-energy\nsubmanifolds determining the stationary state. This is related to the existence of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nfor the noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation (2.1) expressed by the existence of a free energy. From the Hamiltonian\n(3.9) we infer tentatively the zero-energy submanifolds p = 0 and p = 2\u0393\u03b4F/\u03b4u. The transient noiseless submanifold\np = 0 is consistent with the equations of motion and the configurations decay according to the damped deterministic\nGinzburg-Landau equation\n\u03b4F\n\u2202u\n= \u2212\u0393\n.\n(4.15)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\nNote that in contrast to the linear case where the u configurations decompose in k-modes which decay according to\nuk \u221d exp(\u2212\u0393k 2 t), an initial configuration u1 in the nonlinear case will in general decay forming a pattern of interacting\nand annihilating domain wall configurations with superimposed diffusive modes.\nThe stationary submanifold p = 2\u0393\u03b4F/\u03b4u inserted in Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) yields the equations\n\u03b4F\n\u2202u\n=\u0393\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202p\n\u03b4F\n2 \u03b4\n,\n=\u0393\n\u2202t\n\u03b4u \u03b4u\n\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nwhich are consistent since \u2202u/\u2202t = (1/2)p. It is interesting to notice that the motion of u on the stationary noisy\nsubmanifold p = 2\u0393(\u03b4F/\u03b4u) is a time-reversed version of the motion\np = 0. Finally, on the\nR on the transient submanifold\nR\nzero-energy manifold the action in Eq. (3.6) takes the form S = dxdt p\u2202u/\u2202t = 2\u0393 dxdt (\u2202u/\u2202t)(\u03b4F/\u03b4u) = 2\u0393F ,\nyielding the stationary distribution in Eq. (2.5) for the noisy Ginzburg-Landau equation.\nIn the absence of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem as is for example the case for the kinetic KPZ equation or,\nequivalently, noisy Burgers equation, we can in general not explicitly identify the stationary zero-energy submanifold\nand thus simply determine the stationary state; an exception is the KPZ equation in 1D where for special reasons a\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is available, see Refs. [23, 24, 35].\nIn order to address non-equilibrium properties such as a specific transition probability from an initial state u1 to a\nfinal state u2 in passage time T we must address the nonlinear equations of motion (4.1) and (4.2). The field equations\nare not integrable and do not yield to a general analytical solution. However, we can advance our understanding by\nfirst searching for static solutions on the transient manifold p = 0, i.e., the solution of the equation \u03b4F/\u03b4u = 0 yielding\naccording to Eq. (2.6) the domain wall solutions in Eq. (2.7). The domain wall excitations are of the instanton type\nand can be located at arbitrary positions, see Ref. [36]. Since the overlap between two well-separated domain walls\nis exponentially small we can construct approximate multi-domain wall solutions of the form\nudw =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c3i tanh k0 (x \u2212 xi ) + u0 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\ni=1\n\npdw = 0.\n\n(4.19)\n\n\f8\nHere the parity index \u03c3i = \u00b11 for right hand and left hand domain walls, respectively, and xi indicates the center of the\ndomain wall. The offset u0 = 0 for multi-domain wall configurations overlapping for large |x| with two different ground\nstate configurations and u0 = \u00b11 for configurations overlapping with identical ground states u = \u00b11, respectively.\nAssuming that the inter-domain wall distance |xi \u2212 xi+1 | is large compared with the domain wall width 1/k0 , i.e., the\ncase of a dilute domain wall gas, the expression (4.18) constitutes an approximate solution to Eq. (2.6). Since the\ndomain wall solutions are associated with the transient submanifold p = 0 it also follows from Eqs. (4.3), (3.11) and\n(3.10) that they carry vanishing energy, momentum, and action within the canonical phase space approach.\nV.\n\nDOMAIN WALL DYNAMICS\n\nIn order to impart dynamical attributes to the domain walls and thus provide solutions to the coupled field equations\n(4.1) and (4.2) we perform a linear stability analysis about the static domain wall solutions.\nA.\n\nDynamics of a single domain wall\n\nSetting u = udw + \u03b4u and p = pdw + \u03b4p, pdw = 0 in Eqs.

Equations (5.6) and (5.7) have the same structure\nas the Fourier transformed versions of Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5) in the case of the linear diffusive modes, and the solutions\nare given by Eqs.

For \u03bb0 = 0 the equation of motions (5.6) and (5.7) take the form du0 /dt = p0 and dp0 /dt = 0 with\nsolutions u0 = p0 t, p0 = cst. For the field u associated with the mode \u03a80 we have u = udw + u0 \u03a80 . Inserting \u03a80 and\nu0 = p0 t we obtain\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n3k0\nu = udw + p0 \u03c3t\nk0\u22121 \u2207udw \u221d udw (x \u2212 vt),\n(5.15)\n4\ndescribing a domain wall propagating with velocity\nv = \u2212p0 \u03c3\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n4k0\n\n\u00131/2\n\n, \u03c3 = \u00b11.\n\n(5.16)\n\nThe mode \u03a80 is the well-known translation or Goldstone mode restoring the broken translation symmetry associated\nwith the localized domain wall mode. In the present canonical formulation the translation mode also implies the\npropagation of the domain wall.\nIt is also instructive to consider the noise field p which in the dynamical description corresponds to the noise \u03b7. In\nthe case of a single domain wall we obtain from Eq. (5.5) a static configuration. It is, however, clear that the noise\nfield must move together with the domain wall configurations and we conclude that terms beyond linear order give\nrise to a renormalization of the noise field profile implying a finite propagation velocity, i.e.,\np \u221d p0\n\n1\n.\ncosh2 k0 (x \u2212 vt)\n\n(5.17)\n\nThe noise field is thus localized at the position of the domain wall corresponding to a noise impulse associated with\nthe formation of the domain wall. In Fig. 4 we have depicted a single moving right hand domain wall (index \u03c3 = 1)\nwith associated noise field. The dynamics of a single domain wall follows from Eqs.

The time-dependence of u is given by Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8) with \u0393k 2 replaced by \u0393\u03bb1 = 3\u0393k02 . The band of\nplane wave solutions in Eq.

Superposed on the domain walls are localized deformation modes and extended modes of diffusive\ncharacter. The time evolution of the domain wall-linear mode gas is moreover subject to three constraints: 1) the\ntopological signature of the domain walls implies that a right hand domain wall is matched to a consecutive left hand\ndomain wall, 2) translational invariance implies that the total momentum \u03a0 given by Eq. (5.33) is conserved, and 3)\nfinally, time translation invariance entails that the total energy E given by Eq. (5.32) is a constant of motion.\nC.\n\nDomain wall nucleation and annihilation\n\nThe above analysis of the dynamics of the domain wall - diffusive mode system is restricted to the dilute gas regime.\nHowever, the topological constraints together with the conservation laws allow a heuristic analysis of domain wall\ncollisions. When a right hand domain wall collides with a left hand domain wall the topological constraint implies\nthat they must annihilate to the uniform ground states u = +1 or u = \u22121. Moreover, since Eq. (3.11) implies that the\nmomentum \u03a0 = 0 for u = \u00b11, the domain wall pair prior to collision must move with equal and opposite momenta,\ni.e., equal and opposite velocities. Since the phase space formulation is time reversal invariant we also infer that pairs\nof oppositely moving domain walls of opposite parity can nucleate out of\nR the uniform ground states u = \u00b11. In the\nground state Eq. (4.3) implies that the energy is given by E = (1/2) dx p2 . Consequently, in order to generate\ndomain wall pairs out of the ground state we must assign a finite noise field p. In Fig. 5 we have in a plot of t versus\nx depicted the transition from the state u = \u22121 to the state u = +1 due to the formation of a domain wall pair. The\nsystem is of size L and the transition takes place in time T . In Fig. 6 we have shown the corresponding propagation\nof the domain wall pair receeding from the nucleation zone with opposite velocities together with the associated noise\nfield. According to Eqs. (5.16) and (5.17) the noise field profiles comoving with the domain walls are positive and\nhave the form 1/ cosh2 k0 (x \u2212 vt)\nVI.\n\nSTOCHASTIC INTERPRETATION\n\nThe domain wall gas picture introduced above allow a systematic dynamical approach to the determination of\nkinetic pathways and to the evaluation of the Arrhenius factors associated with the transitions. The approach\nmoreover permits a straightforward stochastic interpretation making contact with the customary discussion of the\nnoisy Ginzburg-Landau equation.\n\n\f13\n\nu\n\na)\n\n+1\nx\n-1\n\nb)\n\np\n\nx\n\nFIG. 6: In a) we show the domain wall pair propagating away from the nucleation zone.

The finite-time orbits lie on the finite\nenergy manifolds E0 = (1/2)p20 . In the long time limit T \u2192 \u221e the orbit from u1 to u2 migrates to the zero-energy manifold\nE0 = 0.\n\nA.\n\nDomain wall random walk\n\nIn the case of a single domain wall the dynamics follows from Eqs. (5.6) and (5.7) for \u03bb0 = 0, i.e., the equations\nof motion du0 /dt = p0 and dp0 /dt = 0 with solutions u0 = p0 t, p0 = constant. The energy E0 , momentum \u03a00 and\naction S0 are given by (5.18), (5.19), and (5.20), respectively, and the orbits lie on the energy manifolds E0 = (1/2)p20 .\nIn Fig. 7 we have depicted the phase space for the motion of a single domain wall. The plot depicts orbits from u1\nto u2 in time T on the manifold E0 = (1/2)p20 . In the long time limit the orbits migrate to the zero-energy manifold\nE = 0. The phase space plot is a degenerate limit of the phase space plot in Fig. 3 for k0 \u2192 0. We note the absence\nof a stationary zero-energy manifold and saddle point yielding a stationary state. Since the momentum \u03a00 according\nto Eq. (5.19) is proportional to the canonical momentum p0 it follows directly from the canonical structure that the\nconjugate variable to \u03a00 is the center of mass position x0 of the domain wall. From the Poisson bracket {u0 , p0 } = 1\n\n\f14\nand {x0 , \u03a00 } = 1 together with \u03a00 = \u2212\u03c3(4k0 /3)1/2 p0 , we infer u0 = \u2212\u03c3m1/2 x0 , m = 4k0 /3, and the ensuing equation\nof motion\nm\n\ndx0\n= \u03a00 ,\ndt\n\n(6.1)\n\nwith solution\nx0 =\n\n\u03a00\nt + constant.\nm\n\n(6.2)\n\nLikewise, the energy and action are given by E0 = \u03a020 /2m and\nS0 = T\n\n\u03a020\n.\n2m\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe stochastic interpretation of the phase space dynamics readily follows. Considering an orbit from x1 to x2 traversed\nin time T , corresponding to the propagation of a domain wall with center of mass position x1 at time t = 0 to the\ncenter of mass position x2 at time t = T , and inserting the solution (6.2) in Eq. (5.20) we obtain\nS0 =\n\n1 (x2 \u2212 x1 )2\nm\n,\n2\nT\n\nyielding the transition probability from x1 to x2 in the time interval T\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm (x2 \u2212 x1 )2\n.\nP (x1 , x2 , T ) \u221d exp \u2212\n2\u2206\nT\n\n(6.4)\n\n(6.5)\n\nThis is the Gaussian distribution for random walk with root mean square deviation xrms = (2T \u2206/m)1/2 , m = 4k0 /3.\nWe note that the distribution in Eq. (6.5) is obtained in the limit \u0393 \u2192 0 from the overdamped oscillator distribution\nin Eq. (4.13). We conclude that the uniform or ballistic motion of a domain wall within the dynamical description\ncorresponds precisely to ordinary random walk of the domain wall within the associated stochastic description.\nThe random walk behavior of a domain wall also follows easily from the Ginzburg Landau equation (2.1). Inserting\nthe fluctuating domain wall ansatz u(x, t) = tanh k0 (x \u2212 x(t)), where x(t) is the time-dependent\ncenter of mass x and\nR\nnoting that \u03b4F/\u03b4u = 0 for a domain wall we obtain, integrating over space, setting \u03b7(t) = dx \u03b7(x, t),\ndx(t)\n\u221d \u03b7(t),\ndt\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhich is the Langevin equation for random walk.\nIt is also straightforward to include the contribution to the stochastic behavior from the deformation and diffusive\nmodes associated with the domain wall. From Eq. (4.12) applied to the local deformation mode (def) u1 and the\ndiffusive modes (diff) uk we obtain for the total action for a dressed domain wall\nS = S0 + Sdef + Sdiff ,\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere S0 is given by Eq.

(6.5) and Pdef \u221d exp[\u2212Sdef/\u2206] and Pdiff \u221d exp[\u2212Sdiff /\u2206].

From Eqs. (5.30) and (5.31) for \u03bb0 = 0 we obtain the equations of motion du0i /dt = p0i and dp0i /dt = 0 with\nsolutions u0i = p0i t + cst, p0i = cst. The energy, momentum, and action are given by Eqs. (5.37), (5.38), and (5.39),\nrespectively, and each domain wall lies on the corresponding energy manifold E0i = (1/2)p20i . For each domain wall\nthe phase space plot in Fig. 4 thus applies. Since the action in (5.34) is additive with a contribution from each domain\nwall the transition probabilities factorize and we obtain for the random walk part from (6.5)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nY\nm(xi2 \u2212 xi1 )2\n.\n(6.12)\nexp \u2212\nP ({xi1 }, {xi2 }, T ) \u221d\n2\u2206T\ni\nLikewise, the contributions from the deformation and diffusive modes follow from Eqs. (6.8) and (6.9).\nVII.\n\nKINETIC TRANSITIONS\n\nIn the previous sections we have established the dynamical framework in the case of the noise-driven GinzburgLandau equation and established the connection to the customary stochastic interpretation. In summary, the domain\nwall gas picture provides a description of a switching scenario in terms of moving right hand and left hand domain\nwalls with associated linear modes. The dynamical approach moreover implies that the kinetic pathway from an\ninitial configuration to a final configuration is associated with a specific orbit in canonical phase space. The action\nassociated with the orbit yields the Arrhenius factor associated with the transition. The domain wall gas picture\nshows that a class of orbits, i.e., a class of solutions of the field equations can be parametrized in terms of a dilute gas\nof propagating domain walls with superimposed local deformation and extended phase-shifted diffusive modes. This\npicture is derived from a linear analysis and only holds a priori in a dilute gas limit and at short times. As discussed\nbelow the domain wall dynamics at later times can be extracted heuristically from a combination of selection rules\nand conservation laws.\nA.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nBefore we discuss kinetic transitions it is instructive first briefly to discuss the equilibrium properties. In equilibrium\nthe free energy landscape is determined by the structure of F (u) in Eq. (2.3). The complex landscape is characterized\nby the presence of two global minima corresponding to the uniform ground states u = +1 and u = \u22121 and an infinity\nof saddle points corresponding to static nonuniform multi-domain wall configurations. The flat parts of the saddle\npoints correspond to the translation modes associated with the domain walls. The free energy F = 0 for the ground\nstates. For an n-domain wall configuration F = nm, where the mass m = 4k0 /3. In Fig. 8 we have in sketched the\nfree energy landscape associated with a single static domain wall connecting u = \u22121 and u = +1. In the case of zero\nnoise for \u2206 = 0 the system starting from an arbitrary initial configuration u1 (x) approaches the state with lowest\nfree energy compatible with the imposed boundary conditions. The relaxational dynamics is governed by Eq. (4.15)\nand corresponds in the dynamical approach to an orbit confined to the p = 0 zero-energy submanifold. For open or\nperiodic boundary conditions the configurations with lowest free energy are the two degenerate uniform ground states\nu = \u00b11. Imposing vanishing boundary conditions u = 0 at x = 0 and x = L for a system of size L the field u grows to\nthe uniform values u = \u22121 or u = +1 over a healing length of order 1/k0 . Imposing periodic boundary conditions we\ninfer that the healing profile corresponds to a half domain wall and that the free energy of the configuration equals\n2 \u00d7 (1/2)m = m. Finally, for skew boundary conditions with u = \u22121 for x = 0 and u = +1 for x = L the state with\nlowest free energy corresponds to a single domain wall with free energy m. The different scenarios are depicted in\nFig. 9. In the presence of noise for \u2206 6= 0 the ground states become metastable and the system populates the excited\nstates with F 6= 0. The partition function provides a global characterization of the equilibrium excursions in the free\nenergy landscape and is according to Eq. (2.5) given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n2\u0393\nexp \u2212 F (u) ,\nZ=\n(7.1)\n\u2206\n{u}\n\nwhere the configuration {u} has the free energy F (u), yielding the Boltzmann factor in Eq. (7.1). The evaluation of\nZ and associated correlations, e.g., huui(x, t) in the dilute non-overlapping domain wall gas limit follows closely the\nwell-known soliton and instanton methods developed in the seventies and used in Ref.

The u axis labels collectively\nthe u(x) configurations in the free energy landscape. The points A and B refer to the domain wall positions.

In c) we\nhave depicted the corresponding domain wall configurations at center of mass positions A and B.\n\nferromagnet. Expanding the free energy defined by Eqs.

From the\nstructure of Z we infer ndw = (\u2206/2\u0393)(d log Z/d\u03bc)\u03bc=0 and inserting Eqs.

We have\ndepicted ndw as a function of \u2206 in Fig. 10.\nB.\n\nTransitions in the Kramers case\n\nBefore turning to the noise-induced kinetic transitions in the Ginzburg-Landau equation it is instructive to review the\nclassical Kramers theory [5, 37] for a single degree of freedom, which can be analyzed completely, and its formulation\nwithin the canonical phase space approach.\n1.\n\nKramers theory\n\nWe consider the overdamped case characterized by the Langevin equation for one degree of freedom u\ndu\ndF\n= \u2212\u0393\n+ \u03b7,\ndt\ndu\nh\u03b7(t)\u03b7(0)i = \u2206\u03b4(t),\n\n(7.9)\n(7.10)\n\n\f19\nwith kinetic coefficient \u0393 and noise strength \u2206; in thermal equilibrium \u2206 = 2\u0393T , where T is the temperature. For the\nfree energy F we assume a double well profile with maximum F (0) at u = 0 and minima at u = \u00b11 with F (\u00b11) = 0.\nThe free energy is depicted in Fig. 11 a).

From the conservation\nlaw \u2202P/\u2202t + \u2202J/\u2202u = 0 and Eq.

Here the double derivative F \u2032\u2032 can be associated with the oscillation frequencies\nin the potential well at u = \u22121 and about the maximum at u = 0\n2.\n\nDynamical interpretation of Kramers theory\n\nHere we discuss the Kramers escape problem from a potential well within the canonical phase space method.\nAccording to the general formulation in Sec.

In c) we\nshow the inverted double well potential entering in the Newton equation description of the transition.\n\n\f21\nFor the normalized transition probability we have\ni\nh\n)\nexp \u2212 S(u,T\n\u2206\nh\ni\nP (u, T ) = R\n)\ndu exp \u2212 S(u,T\n\u2206\n\n(7.21)\n\nIn Fig. 11 b) we have depicted the phase space for the Kramers escape case. The zero-energy manifolds are given by\np = 0 and p = 2\u0393dF/du. On the phase space plot we have shown an orbit from region A to region B, i.e., across the\nfree energy barrier. Comparing Fig. 11 a) with Fig. 11 b) we note that the \"uphill\" part of the orbit in region A is\ncontrolled by the p = 2\u0393dF/du manifold whereas the \"downhill\" part in region B is controlled by the p = 0 manifold.\nIn the long time limit the orbit approaches the zero-energy manifolds p = 0 and p = 2\u0393dF/du passing close to the\nsaddle points at u = \u22121, u = 0, and u = 1. A simple calculation along the \"bulge\" setting H = 0 and inserting\np = 2\u0393dF/du in Eq.

In Fig. 11 c) we have shown the potential\nwhich for a double well free energy possesses three maxima at u = 0 and u = \u00b11. As indicated in Fig. 11 c) the long\ntime orbit from A to B is associated with the long waiting time at the maximum for u = 0\nC.\n\nTransitions in the Ginzburg-Landau case\n\nIn order to induce a non-equilibrium kinetic transition across the free energy landscape in the Ginzburg-Landau\ncase we fix the initial configuration u1 (x) at time t = 0 and the final configuration u2 (x) at time T . There are\ntwo fundamental issues: 1) the determination of the kinetic pathways and 2) the evaluation of the transition rate.\nGenerally, in order to minimize the free-energy cost, the pathway passes via saddle points, i.e., the multi-domain wall\nexcitations, in the free energy landscape. The actual path chosen, however, depends on the time T allocated to the\ntransition. The transition rate is determined by the Arrhenius factor exp(\u22122\u0393F/\u2206) associated with the free energy\nF of the saddle points encountered along the pathway. In addition there is a prefactor determined by the attempt\nfrequencies; this issue, however, is not dealt with in the present context.\nFocussing on a kinetic transition or switch between the two ground states u = \u22121 and u = +1 the pathway\ncorresponds to nucleation of domain walls and their subsequent propagation across the system. Let us first consider\nthe case of fixed boundary conditions u = 0 at x = 0 and x = L. The ground state configurations are depicted in\nFig. 9 b). In the presence of noise the ground states are metastable and the system can switch from u = \u22121 to u = +1\nby means of the propagation of a single domain wall across the sample in the transition time T . As discussed above\nthe profiles close to the boundaries over a healing length of order k0\u22121 correspond to half domain walls and the free\nenergy of either ground state is equal to Fdw = m, m = 4k0 /3; note that for periodic boundary conditions as depicted\nin Fig. 9 a) the free energy of the ground states vanishes. In order to effectuate a transition a domain wall must\nnucleate at either boundary and subsequently propagate across the system. The nucleation free energy is Fdw = m\nand from our discussion of the Kramers case we infer the Arrhenius factor exp(\u22122\u0393m/\u2206) or within the dynamical\ndescription a nucleation action of the order\nSnucl = 2\u0393m.\n\n(7.24)\n\nWithin the conventional stochastic description the noise generates both the nucleation and the subsequent diffusion\nof the domain wall across the sample. Since the domain wall carries a finite energy we must within the dynamical\ndescription assign a finite energy or finite noise field p(x) at t = 0 in order to ensure propagation of the domain wall.\nConsidering the case where the right hand domain wall nucleates at x = 0, we assign the noise field p(x) \u221d p0 / cosh2 k0 x\ngiven by Eq. (5.17) at time t = 0. In terms of the momentum \u03a00 = \u2212p0 m1/2 given by Eq. (5.19) we thus obtain the\nvelocity v = \u03a00 /m, energy E0 = \u03a020 /2m, and action by Eq. (6.3), i.e., S0 = T \u03a020 /2m.

The domain wall is nucleated at x = 0 and annihilated at x = 1. In b) the process is depicted in an\n(x, t) plot.\n\nof size L is switched at time T moreover impose a selection rule on the propagation velocity. We infer v = L/T and\nobtain the action S0 = mL2 /2T associated with the transition. The total action associated with a single domain wall\nswitch is thus given by\nS1 (T ) = Snucl +\n\nmL2\n.\n2T\n\n(7.25)\n\nIn Fig. 12 we have in a) depicted the propagation of a single right hand domain wall across the sample. In b) we have\nshown the transition in an (x, t) plot. In the present case with fixed boundary conditions the momentum \u03a00 associated\nwith the motion of the domain wall is generated at the boundary x = 0 at time t = 0 and,\nR subsequently, absorbed at\nthe boundary x = L at time t = T . The momentum is given by Eq. (5.13), i.e., \u03a00 = p0 dxuRdw d\u03a80 /dx. Inserting \u03a80\nand udw given by Eqs. (5.8) and (2.7), respectively, and performing a partial integration using dx cosh\u22124 k0 x = 4/3k0\nwe obtain \u03a00 = \u2212p0 m1/2 > 0 since p0 < 0 for a positive propagation velocity. Correspondingly, the momentum is\nabsorbed at x = L.\nFor fixed boundary conditions the transition from u = \u22121 to u = +1 can also take place by means of nucleation\nof two domain walls at both ends of the system. The domain walls subsequently propagate towards one another and\nannihilate at x = L/2. The scenario is shown Fig. 13. Since the action is additive for the two-domain wall system the\nnucleation action is given by 2Snucl = 2m. However, in order to effectuate the transition in time T the velocity is half\nthe velocity in the single domain wall case and we obtain for the action associated with the 2-domain wall transition\nS2 (T ) = 2Snucl +\n\nmL2\n.\n4T\n\n(7.26)\n\n\f23\n\nC-162-180\n\n1.0\na)\n0.5\n\nu\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nx\nt\n\u03a4\nb)\n\nu = --1\n\nu = --1\n\nu = +1\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 13: In a) the switching from u = +1 to u = \u22121 in time T takes place by means of two domain walls propagating in\nopposite directions with velocity v = 1/2T . The domain walls nucleate at the boundaries and annihilate at the center. In b)\nthe switching process is depicted in an (x, t) plot.\n\nFinally, in the general case of a transition from u = +1 to u = \u22121 in time T by means of the nucleation and\npropagation of n domain walls the nucleation action is nSnucl and the domain walls move with velocity L/T n; we\nobtain the action\nSn (T ) = nSnucl +\n\nmL2\n.\n2nT\n\n(7.27)\n\nIn Fig. 14 we have in an (xt) plot shown a 4-domain wall switch.\nIn addition to domain wall modes time-dependent localized deformation and extended diffusive modes are also\nexcited, corresponding to small Gaussian fluctuations about the local minima and saddle points and the transition\npathway from u = +1 to u = \u22121 proceeds by propagating domain walls with superposed linear modes subject to Renergy\nand momentum conservation and topological constraints. The energy of the initial state is given by E = (1/2) dxp2\nand the noise field thus has to be assigned initially in order to reach the switched state u = \u22121 in a prescribed time T .\nFor topological reasons the domain walls must nucleate and annihilate in pairs subject to absorption or radiation of\nlinear modes, respectively. Since the linear modes also carry positive action the dynamical modes with lowest action\ncorrespond to nucleation or annihilation of domain wall pairs with equal\nand opposite momenta, i.e., equal velocities.\nR\nIn the case of periodic boundary conditions the momentum \u03a0 = dxu\u2202p/\u2202x of the initial and final states is zero.\nThe system is translational invariant and the formation and annihilation of one or several domain wall pairs moving\nwith the same speed take place at equidistant positions along the axis. For fixed boundary conditions the translational\ninvariance is broken and the momentum \u03a0 is nonvanishing corresponding to nucleation and annihilation of domain\nwalls at the boundaries. This general scenario of switching is completely consistent with the numerical analysis in\n\n\f24\n\nt\nT\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n+1\n\n+1\n\n+1\n\n0\n\nx\nL\n\nFIG. 14: We show a 4-domain wall switch in an (x, t) plot.\n\n[21].\n1.\n\nImproved estimate of Snucl\n\nThe above estimate of the nucleation action Snucl for a domain wall was based on an analogy with the Arrhenius\nfactor in the simple Kramers case of escape from a potential well. Here we improve the estimate of Snucl based on\nthe phase space formulation. We consider the case of a switch from u = +1 to u = \u22121 in time T proceeding by\n1) the nucleation of two domain walls at the center of the system during the time interval \u03b4t, 2) propagation of the\ndomain walls with opposite velocities during the time interval T \u2212 2\u03b4t, and 3) the annihilation of the domain walls at\nthe boundaries during the time interval \u03b4t. From the width of a single domain wall k0\u22121 and the propagation velocity\nv = L/2T we estimate the nucleation time, i.e., the time it takes for the nucleation to separate in two distinct domain\nwalls, to be of order \u03b4t \u2248 2/vk0 = 4T /k0 L. From Eq. (3.10) the nucleation action per domain wall is given by\nSnucl\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\nu,\u03b4t\n\ndxdt(pdu/dt \u2212 H),\n\n(7.28)\n\nu=+1,0\n\nwhere u is the nucleation configuration just prior to breaking up into two domain walls; H is the energy density\nwhich we determine below. In order to estimate Snucl we consider the field equations (4.1) and (4.2). The initial\nconfiguration is u(x) = u(x, t = 0) = 1 and denoting the initial noise field by p0 (x) = p(x, t = 0) and, moreover,\nconsidering a large system so that \u03b4t is small, we obtain to leading order in \u03b4t from the equations of motion\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\u0012 2\n\u2202 u(x, t)\n2\n2\n+\n2\u0393k\nu(x,\nt)(1\n\u2212\nu(x,\nt)\n)\n+\np\n(x)\n\u03b4t + 1,\n(7.29)\nu(x, t) \u2248\n\u0393\n0\n0\n\u2202x2\nt=0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 2 p(x, t\n2\n2\n\u2212 2\u0393k0 p(x, t)(1 \u2212 3u(x, t) )\np(x, t) \u2248 \u2212\u0393\n\u03b4t + p0 (x),\n(7.30)\n\u2202x2\nt=0\nor by insertion\nu(x, t) \u2248 p0 (x)\u03b4t + 1,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22022p\np(x, t) \u2248 \u0393 \u2212 2 + 4k02 p0 (x) \u03b4t + p0 (x).\n\u2202x\n\n(7.31)\n(7.32)\n\nThese solutions describe the initial part of the orbit in (up) phase space corresponding to the nucleation of two domain\nwalls. The unspecified initial noise field p0 (x) acts as an initiator. The noise profile\nR p0 (x) is localized at the position\nof the nucleation.

First we observe that the minimizing configurations, the minimizers, of (8.1) are\nidentical to the orbits found within the canonical phase space approach. This correspondence was discussed in Sec.\nIII and is seen by noting that insertion of the equation of motion for p and the Hamiltonian (4.3) in the expression\nfor the action (3.10) yields the Freidlin-Wentzel form in (8.1).\n\n\f26\nSwitching a system of size L in time T by means of a single domain wall, corresponding to the pathway via the\nlowest local minimum of the free energy at Fdw = m, the propagation velocity v = p0 /m = L/T and we obtain the\naction S1 (T ) = Snucl + mL2 /2T in Eq.

At\nlong times the action falls off as 1/T . At intermediate times t and positions x we have P \u221d exp(\u2212mx2 /2\u2206t) and\nthe domain wall in the stochastic interpretation perform a random walk with mean square displacement 2\u2206t/m,\ncorresponding to diffusive behavior. In Fig. 12 a we have shown a domain wall nucleating at the left boundary and\npropagating with constant velocity v = 1/T to the right boundary, where it annihilates. We have used the same\nparameter values as in [21], i.e., \u03b4 = \u0393 = .03, 2\u0393k02 = \u03b4 \u22121 , T = 7, and a system size L = 1. In Fig. 12 b we have\nplotted the trajectory of the domain wall in space and time.\nThe switching can also take place by nucleating two domain walls at the boundaries. These then move at half the\nvelocity v/2 and subsequently annihilate at the center. This process corresponds to the pathway via the local saddle\npoint of the free energy at Fdw = 2m, and the action is given by S2 (T ) = 2Snucl0 + 2S1 (4T ) in Eq. (7.26). The\nassociated transition probability is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2Snucl\nmL2\nP \u221d exp \u2212\nexp \u2212\n.\n(8.3)\n\u2206\n4T \u2206\nSnapshots of this process are shown in Fig. 13 a and the corresponding space-time plot in Fig. 13 b.\nCombining the contributions from nucleation and the subsequent domain wall propagation we obtain the heuristic\nexpression in Eq. (7.27), where Snuc is the action for nucleating a single domain wall and n is the number of walls.\nFrom the improved estimate of Snucl in Eq. (7.34) with fudge factor f \u2248 1 we have\nSnuc \u223c 5\u0393k0 .\n\n(8.4)\n\nIn Fig. 16 we have plotted S versus T for n = 1 \u2212 6 domain walls using the parameter values in [21]. Choosing Snuc\naccording to (8.4) we find excellent agreement with the numerical results.\nAs also discussed in [21] we note that the switching scenario depends on T . At shorter switching times it becomes\nmore favorable to nucleate more domain walls. In the present formulation this feature is associated with the finite\nnucleation or annihilation action Snuc . This is evidently a finite size effect in the sense that the action at a fixed T\ndiverges in the thermodynamic limit L \u2192 \u221e, corresponding to the broken symmetry.\nIX.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn the present paper we have implemented the dynamical phase space approach developed previously for the noisy\nBurgers equation to the case of the one dimensional noise-driven Ginzburg-Landau equation. Based on a linear\nanalysis of the static domain wall solutions in the noiseless case we find that the kinetic transitions take place by\nmeans of propagating multi-domain wall configurations with superimposed local deformation and extended diffusive\nmodes. The approach also allows for a determination of the Arrhenius factor associated with the transitions. The\nmotivation for the present work is a recent numerical optimization study by E et. al. [21] of the noisy one dimensional\nGinzburg-Landau equation based on the Freidlin-Wentzel theory of large deviations. We find excellent agreement\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively with the numerical finding of E. et al. [21]. The dynamical approach offers in\nthe nonperturbative weak noise or low temperature limit an alternative way of determining dynamical pathways and\nthe Arrhenius part of the associated transition rates.\n\n\f27\n\n35\n\nC-162-181\n\n25\n6\nS( T )\n\n5\n4\n\n15\n\n3\n2\n1\n5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nT\n\nFIG. 16: The action S(T ) given by (7.27) is plotted as a function of T for transition pathways involving up to n = 6 domain\nwalls. The lowest action and thus the most probable transition is associated with an increasing number of domain walls at\nshorter times, indicated by the heavy limiting curve. The curves correspond to choosing Snuc = 5\u0393k0 .\n\n[1] P. L. Geissler, C. Dellago, D. Chandler, J. Hutter, and M. Parrinello, Science 291, 2121 (2001).\n[2] D. V. Berkov, J. Magn. Mag.
