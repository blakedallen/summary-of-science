In low energy supersymmtric models the electroweak scale is naturally of the order\nof the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the theory. Much work has been done in the search\nfor an appropriate mechanism for SUSY breaking, but, at present, it remains unknown.\nTwo types of SUSY breaking mediation mechanisms, supergravity-mediated [1] and gaugemediated [2], have been studied extensively. Recently, another type of mediation mechanism,\ni.e. Anomaly\u2013Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB), has become under scrutiny [3,\n4, 5].1 Each of these mechanisms has unique aspects which differ from each other. One of\nthe important aspects of AMSB is that the soft SUSY breaking terms are Renormalization\nGroup (RG) invariant, in the sense that they become independent of the specific ultraviolet\nboundary conditions. In fact, the magnitudes of the soft SUSY breaking terms at any scale\nare obtained in terms of values of the related gauge and Yukawa couplings at that scale, hence,\nthey are determined as a function of the measured values of those couplings at the weak scale.\nThus, the AMSB scenario yields definite phenomenological predictions. However, within the\nframework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), one of the predictions\nis quite problematic, since it implies the existence of negative values for the slepton squared\nmasses. The simplest way to solve this problem is to add a universal contribution m0 to all\nsoft SUSY breaking scalar masses [3, 8]. There is, however, no dynamical explanation for the\norigin of this term and there is no obvious reason why extra contributions should not appear\nas well for the other soft SUSY breaking terms: gaugino masses and the trilinear Yukawa\ncouplings Af which couple Higgs and scalar fermion fields. Moreover, the addition of the\nuniversal value m0 to all soft scalar masses, although provides a solution to the tachyonic\nspectra, it also violates the RG-invariance, which is one of the most attractive aspects in the\nAMSB scenario.\nIndependently of recent works on anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking, RG-invariant relations of soft SUSY breaking terms have been studied in the literature[9, 10]. The relation\n1\n\nSee also Ref.[6, 7]. In Ref.[7] anomaly mediation has been discussed within the framework of supergravity.\n\n2\n\n\fto the case of anomaly mediated SUSY breaking has been clarified in Ref.[11]. In Ref.[10]\nthe RG-invariant sum rule of soft scalar masses has been discussed and its importance has\n2\nbeen emphasized. That is, the sum of three scalar masses squared, Mi,j,k\n\u2261 m2i + m2j + m2k ,\n\ncorresponding to chiral fields for which the Yukawa couplings Y ijk 6= 0 are allowed, e.g.\n\n(i, j, k) = (Q, u, H2), (Q, d, H1) and (L, e, H1 ) 2 , is more important to RG-invariance than\n\nany one of the scalar mass terms independently. This is the case since such a sum appears in\nthe \u03b2-functions of the Yukawa couplings and soft SUSY breaking masses themselves. Hence,\none could allow for additional contributions to each of the soft scalar masses, as long as the\nsum itself is not affected. For example, this situation can be realized by additional D-term\ncontributions, which are proportional to a charge qi of the field under a broken symmetry [12, 13] and such that in the allowed Yukawa couplings the charge must be conserved,\n2\nqi + qj + qk = 0. Then, in the sum of the soft SUSY breaking parameters, Mi,j,k\n, the D-term\n\ncontributions cancel each other.\nIn the present work we shall investigate the possibility of having a similar behaviour as\nthe one explained above, assuming a generalization of anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking\nmodels with residual, non-decoupling effects from extra U(1)'s at a high energy scale. In [5]\nit was concluded that all effects coming from a high scale theory decouple in pure anomaly\nmediation in the absence of light singlets. The authors of ref. [5] explored also extensions\nof the AMSB scenarios in which non-decoupling effects survive at low energies allowing, for\nexample, for genuine D-term contributions. In a generic framework, D-term contributions\nhave been proposed as a solution to the tachyonic slepton mass problem both in Refs.\n[5, 14]. Here we shall analyse the features of the particle spectrum depending on the specific\ncharge assignments of the additional D-term contributions to each of the soft scalar mass\nparameters. We shall then explore the regions of the parameter space for which no tachyonic\nslepton masses appear. A novel point of the present work is to study the phenomenological\naspects of these theories, making use of the RG-invariant sum of the soft SUSY breaking\nscalar squared masses. In this way, we preserve one of the most appealing features of the\nanomaly-mediated SUSY breaking scenarios, namely its high predictivity with induced soft\n2\n\nQ=(u,d) and L=(\u03bde , e) are the SU(2) left handed superfield doublets; H1 , H2 are the two Higgs doublets\n\nand u, d, e are SU(2) right-handed superfield singlets.\n\n3\n\n\fmasses which are independent of flavour physics, and we cure the main problem associated\nto them, namely the tachyonic solutions for the slepton sector.3\nThe paper is organized as follows.\n\nIn Section 2 we define the framework: we as-\n\nsume additional D-term contributions to soft scalar masses m2i , requiring that the sum\n2\nMi,j,k\n\u2261 m2i + m2j + m2k remains RG-invariant, a property shared by AMSB scenarios. We\n\nimplement the electroweak symmetry breaking condition and discuss generic class of models\nwith suitable D-term contributions to investigate the properties of the mass spectrum. In\nSection 3 we investigate specific models in detail, imposing the present experimental bounds\non supersymmetric particle masses. We present two examples with fixed charge assignments\nand study their mass spectra. Section 4 is devoted to our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nRG-invariant sum rule and D-term contributions\n\n2.1\n\nSum rule\n\nIn the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking scenario the soft SUSY breaking parameters, i.e.\nthe gaugino masses M\u03b1 , the soft scalar masses mi and the A-parameters are given by, [3, 4, 5]\nM\u03b1 =\n\n\u03b2g\u03b1\nmX ,\ng\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nX \u2202\u03b3i\n1 X \u2202\u03b3i\nm2i = \u2212 \uf8ed\n\u03b2g\u03b1 +\n\u03b2Y ijk \uf8f8 m2X ,\nijk\n4 \u03b1 \u2202g\u03b1\n\u2202Y\nY ijk\n\nAijk = \u2212\n\n\u03b2Y ijk\nmX ,\nY ijk\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere g\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, and Y ijk , with (i, j, k) = (Q, u, H2 ), (Q, d, H1 ), (L, e, H1 ), are\nthe gauge couplings and the Yukawa couplings, and \u03b2g\u03b1 and \u03b2Y ijk are their \u03b2-functions,\nrespectively. Here \u03b3i are the anomalous dimensions of the chiral superfields. For explicit\ncalculations, it is convenient to define mF \u2261 mX /(16\u03c0 2 ), because \u03b2-functions include the\nloop-factor 16\u03c0 2 .\n3\n\nThere has been other attempts of constructing generalizations of AMSB models, curing the problem\n\nof tachyonic solutions in the slepton sector and still assuring a scale invariance of the solutions, like the\nanti-gauge mediated model of ref. [5] or a complementary proposal in ref. [14].\n\n4\n\n\fEqs.(1)-(3) are RG-invariant, that is, they are valid at any scale. Thus, the soft SUSY\nbreaking terms are expressed as a function of gauge and Yukawa couplings at a given scale\ntimes the overall magnitude mF . The consequent high predictability in the model leads to a\nproblem in the MSSM, since the \u03b2-function coefficients for the weak gauge couplings, b1 =\n\n33\n,\n5\n\nb2 = 1 and b3 = \u22123 render the squared soft SUSY breaking parameters for the sleptons\nnegative, yielding tachyonic slepton masses. Here we shall discuss phenomenological aspects\nof a solution to the tachyonic slepton mass spectrum, based on contributions from D-terms\nto those soft SUSY breaking parameters. We shall show that, depending on the specific\nD-term charge assignments, the mass spectrum can be very different from the one obtained\nin the framework of a universal m20 contribution to all the soft SUSY breaking squared mass\nparameters.\nAt the present stage, it is a trivial statement that the sum,\n\u03a3m2AM \u2261 (m2i )AM + (m2j )AM + (m2k )AM ,\n\n(4)\n\nis RG-invariant for non vanishing Yukawa couplings, Y ijk 6= 0, because each of the soft scalar\nmasses is RG-invariant. Now, let us assume additional contributions to soft scalar masses\nm2i , with the requirement that the sum \u03a3m2AM does not change. This can be realized by\nD-term contributions which are proportional to charges qi of the chiral superfields under a\nbroken symmetry, that is, the total soft scalar mass is given by,\nm2i = (m2i )AM + qi m2D ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere mD is a universal parameter which defines the overall magnitude of the D-term contributions. We require for the allowed Yukawa couplings that the total charge should be\nconserved, i.e. qi + qj + qk = 0. Hence, the sum does not change,\n2\nMi,j,k\n\u2261 m2i + m2j + m2k = \u03a3m2AM ,\n\n(6)\n\nand it is RG-invariant still after inclusion of the additional D-term contributions. The only\neffect of the D term is to modify the boundary conditions of the scalar masses at the scale\nwhere the U(1)'s get broken, but with no effects on the RG evolution of these masses. Eq.\n(5) is therefore valid at any scale. For a fixed charge assignment, the free parameters of the\n5\n\n\ftheory are mF and mD . Similarly, the sum, eq.(6), does not change if additional contributions\nto soft scalar masses are due to a certain type of supergravity theory, e.g. moduli-dominated\nSUSY breaking in perturbative heterotic string models [15, 16]. In this case, the charge qi\nfor the D-term contribution is replaced by qi \u221d 1 + ni , where ni is the modular weight of\nthe field \u03a6i . Hereafter, we mean charge qi as a coefficient of the deviation from the anomaly\nmediated soft SUSY breaking mass parameters squared, with the universal magnitude m2D\nin eq.(5), to include the realization by the moduli-dominant SUSY breaking. For the D-term\ncontributions possible terms of O(g 4) may also appear [5]. Our assumption includes the fact\nthat both the (m2i )AM and the D-term contribution, which is of O(g 2), are the significant\nquantities and of comparable magnitudes. Thus, we neglect further contributions of O(g 4)\ncompared with (m2i )AM . A similar statement has been done already in Ref.[5].\n\n2.2\n\nDiscussion on models\n\nIn order to proceed with our study, we need to assign the charges qi . For instance, in Ref.\n[17] it is clarified that there are three U(1) symmetries, which are flavor-independent and\nallow the usual Yukawa couplings, i.e. R, A and L up to the baryon number symmetry\nB. That is exactly consistent with the four degrees of freedom to deform each mi keeping\nthe sum of the scalar squared masses of the superfields, (Q, u, H2), (Q, d, H1) and (L, e, H1 )\nfixed. The generic U(1) symmetry X is a linear combination of them,\nX = mR + nA + pL + qB.\n\n(7)\n\nWe must then identify the charge qiX with qi for each chiral superfield i = Q, u, d, L, e, H1\nand H2 . Charge assignments are shown in Table 1. Observe that the hypercharge is just a\nlinear combination of the B, L and R symmetries, 3Y \u2212 3R \u2212 3L = \u2212B.\nThe extra U(1)'s appear naturally in GUT groups, like SO(10) and E6 . Indeed in the\nbreaking E6 \u2192 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1) the extra U(1) charges have the same sign for both left- and\nright-handed lepton superfields[18] providing a possibility to obtain positive slepton masses.\nWe will discuss this kind of model in detail in Section 3.1.\nIt turns out that constructing a viable model starting from SO(10) is much more complicated. One finds immediately that when SO(10) breaks directly to the Standard Model\n6\n\n\fQ\n\nu\n\nd\n\nL\n\ne\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\nR\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u20131\n\n1\n\nA\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nL\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB\n\n\u20131\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nX\n\n\u2212q\n\n\u2212m + q\n\nm\u2212n+q\n\n\u2212m + n\n\nm\n\n\u2212n \u2212 p m + p\n\nTable 1: Charge assignment\n.\n\ngauge group or via SU(5) \u00d7 U(1) with conventional assignments of the fermions in five and\nten dimensional representations, one cannot get positive slepton masses squared.

For concreteness, we write explicitly the\nthree types of sum rules, valid for all three generations,\nm2Q\u0303 + m2\u0169 + m2H2 = (m2Q\u0303 + m2\u0169 + m2H2 )AM ,\n\n(8)\n\nm2Q\u0303 + m2d \u0303 + m2H1 = (m2Q\u0303 + m2d \u0303 + m2H1 )AM ,\n\n(9)\n\nm2L\u0303 + m\u1ebd2 + m2H1 = (m2L\u0303 + m\u1ebd2 + m2H1 )AM .\n\n(10)\n\nHere we parameterize the deviations of the Higgs masses from the anomaly-mediated ones\nas\nm2Hi = (m2Hi )AM \u2212 dHi m2F .\n\n(11)\n\nWe fix the magnitudes of the \u03bc-term and the B-term by use of the minimization conditions\nfor the Higgs effective potential, to assure proper radiative electroweak symmetry breaking,\n2\u03bc2 + MZ2 =\n\nm2H1 \u2212 m2H2\n\u2212 m2H1 \u2212 m2H2 ,\n\u2212 cos 2\u03b2\n7\n\n(12)\n\n\f2\u03bcB = sin 2\u03b2(\n\nm2H1 \u2212 m2H2\n\u2212 MZ2 ).\n\u2212 cos 2\u03b2\n\n(13)\n\nIn the above, we have considered the minimization conditions derived from the tree level\nexpression for the Higgs effective potential. The inclusion of the one-loop RG improved\neffective potential would modify the above equations in such a way that the quantitative\nbehaviour of the solutions will be modified, but the qualitative features are expected to be\nsimilar. First of all, the condition m2L\u0303 + m2\u1ebd > 0 requires dH1 > 0.71. Another important condition for the successful electroweak symmetry breaking is the present experimental\nbound on m2A , where m2A = 2\u03bc2 + m2H1 + m2H2 is the squared mass of the CP-odd Higgs field.\nFor explicit models, which shall be discussed later, we require the fulfillment of the present\n2\nexperimental bound from LEP, mA > mexp\nA \u2243 88 GeV [23]. However, if mF is large enough\n\ncompared with MZ2 , the condition m2A > 0 is effectively equivalent to the experimental bound\n\nand corresponds to \u2206m2 \u2261 m2H1 \u2212m2H2 > 0 (see Eq. 12). In addition to the overall scale m2F ,\nthe difference \u2206m2 depends on dH2 \u2212 dH1 and tan \u03b2. Thus, the condition \u2206m2 > 0 leads\n\nto a minimum value of dH2 \u2212 dH1 , which depends on tan \u03b2, and combined with dH1 > 0.71\nleads to a minimum value for dH2 . In the absence of D-terms, dHi = 0, i = 1, 2, we have\n\u2206m2 /m2F = O(10) except around tan \u03b2 \u223c 50. Such a large value of \u2206m2 implies that a negative value of dH2 will be allowed, even after including a non-vanishing value of dH1 > 0.71.\nOn the other hand, around tan \u03b2 = 50 we have \u2206m2 /m2F = O(0.1) and then, for dH1 > 0.71,\nonly positive values of dH2 are allowed. The smallness of \u2206m2 close to tan\u03b2 = 50 is due to\nthe fact that for such large value of tan \u03b2 the bottom Yukawa coupling becomes strong and\nvery close in magnitude to the top Yukawa coupling. Hence, the evolution of the Higgs mass\nparameters is very similar, (mH1 )AM \u2243 (mH2 )AM , for tan \u03b2 \u2243 50. The solid line in Fig. 1\n\nshows the minimum value of dH2 against tan \u03b2 under the condition \u2206m2 > 0, that is, the\ncondition m2A > 0 for m2F \u226b MZ2 . For tan \u03b2 > 50 there is a change in the slope for dH2 .\nThis is due to a change in the sign of the \u03b2-function of the bottom Yukawa coupling after\na vanishing value is achieved due to a compensation between the effects associated with the\nstrong gauge coupling and the bottom Yukawa coupling itself.\nNow let us consider the minimum value of mF . The gaugino mass M2 is obtained to be\nM2 \u2243 0.43 mF .\n8\n\n(14)\n\n\fAs we shall show at the end of this section, in the whole (dH1 , dH2 ) parameter space under\nconsideration, we always have M2 \u226a |\u03bc|. This implies that the lightest chargino is wino-like.\nHence, the present experimental lower bound on the chargino mass, m\u03c7\u00b1 < 90GeV , implies\nthat the mass parameter mF is bounded to be\nmF > 210 GeV.\n\n(15)\n\n\u2243 88 GeV lifts up the curve\nFor example, for mF = 210 GeV, the condition mA > mexp.\nA\nwhich defines the minimum value of dH2 in Fig. 1 by 0.3.\nNext we calculate the stop mass, in particular the average stop mass mt\u0303,av , which is\ndefined as m2t\u0303,av \u2261 (m2Q\u0303 +m2\u0169 )/2+m2t . In the limit under discussion in this section, m2F \u226b MZ2 ,\nthe contribution from the top quark mass is negligible and the average stop mass depends\nonly on dH2 . The dotted lines in Fig. 1 show contours of constant values of the ratio\nRt\u0303 = mt\u0303,av /M2 for Rt\u0303 = 8, 10 and 12. Obviously, as dH2 increases, Rt\u0303 increases. The thick\nsolid line in Fig. 2 shows the minimum value of Rt\u0303 as a function of tan \u03b2. The minimum\nvalue of Rt\u0303 is at tan \u03b2 \u2243 3 and implies that mt\u0303,av \u2265 6.6M2 . The thin solid line gives a\nsimilar ratio for the average sbottom mass, Rb\u0303 = mb\u0303,av /M2 with m2b\u0303,av \u2243 (m2Q\u0303 + m2d \u0303)/2. The\ndotted line corresponds to a similar ratio but for first and second generation squark masses\nR\u0169 = m\u0169,av /M2 with m2\u0169,av \u2261 (m2Q\u03031,2 + m2\u01691,2 )/2 being the average squared mass in the upsquark sector. On can define the analogous quantity in the down sector Rd \u0303 = md,av\n \u0303 /M2 , with\nm2d,av\n\u2261 (m2Q\u03031,2 + m2d \u03031,2 )/2. It turns out, however, that the down-squark sector is stable as a\n \u0303\nfunction of tan \u03b2, with Rd \u0303 of order 10 for most tan\u03b2 regions. Such a behaviour is expected\nsince the main dependence on tan \u03b2 in the first and second generation down-squark sector\ncomes through dH1 , which is fixed to its minimum value via the condition of positive slepton\nsquared masses, dH1 > 0.71. The up-squark sector instead, depends on dH2 and hence on\ntan \u03b2, as shown in Fig 2. From Fig. 2 it follows that, all squark masses are very heavy\ncompared to gaugino mass parameters, as expected from the underlying structure of AMSB\nscenarios. This conclusion holds, unless there is a large hierarchy between the left and right\nhanded soft SUSY breaking parameters in the squark sector, as we shall discuss below.\n\n9\n\n\f30\n\nRt\u0303 = 12\n\n25\n20\n15\n\ndH2 10\n\nRt\u0303 = 10\n\n5\n0\n\nRt\u0303 = 8\n\n-5\n-10\n2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\nFig.1: The minimum value of dH2 (solid line) and constant contours of Rt\u0303 , the ratio of the\naverage stop mass to the SU(2) gaugino mass parameter, M2 , which determines the\nchargino mass in this large \u03bc scenario, (dotted lines).\n12\n11\n\nR\u0169\n10\n\nRb\u0303\n\nRq\u0303 9\n8\n7\n6\n2\n\nRt\u0303\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\nFig.2: The minimum of the ratio of the average stop mass (thick solid line), of the average\nsbottom mass (thin solid line) and of the first and second generation up-sector squark\nmasses (dotted line) to the SU(2) mass parameter M2 .\n\nNow let us discuss the magnitude of \u03bc in these models. In the case with dHi = 0, we\n10\n\n\fhave\n\u03bc2 + MZ2 /2\n\u223c 10,\nm2F\n\n(16)\n\nfor any value of 2 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 60. Moreover, from the expression for \u03bc2\n\u03bc2 = \u2212m2H1 + [(m2A + MZ2 )\n\ntan2 \u03b2\n\u2212 MZ2 ],\ntan2 \u03b2 + 1\n\n(17)\n\nin which the second term in RHS is always positive for tan \u03b2 > MZ /mA , one can derive the\nfollowing inequality,\n\u03bc2 > \u2212m2H1 > \u2212(m2H1 )AM .\n\n(18)\n\nThe second inequality in eq.(18) is due to the constraint dH1 > 0. We combine eqs. (14),\n(16) and (18), and find that |\u03bc| is larger than M2 . Fig. 3 shows the minimum value of the\nratio R\u03bc \u2261 \u03bc\u2032 /M2 , with \u03bc\u2032 =\n\nq\n\n\u03bc2 + MZ2 /2, as a function of tan \u03b2, in the parameter space\n\n(dH1 , dH2 ) allowed by the conditions m2L\u0303 + m2\u1ebd > 0 and \u2206m2 > 0. To realize the minimum\nvalue, an extreme value of the ratio rd = dH2 /dH1 is sometimes required. For example, for\ntan \u03b2 = 3 the minimum value of R\u03bc \u2243 2.5 is obtained, and that is realized for rd = \u221213.\n\nFig. 4 shows the minimum value R\u03bc as a function of rd for tan \u03b2 = 3, 20 and 50. Note that\nas tan \u03b2 increases, the minimum values of dH2 and rd increase. Hence, as a generic aspect of\nthese models, the mass parameter |\u03bc| (as well as the the squark masses) is large compared\nwith the gaugino mass parameters, M1 and M2 .\n7.5\n7\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n\nR\u03bc\n\n5\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\nFig.3: The minimum value of R\u03bc =\n\nq\n\n\u03bc2 + MZ2 /2/M2 as a function of tan \u03b2.\n\n11\n\n\f11\n10\n\ntan \u03b2 = 3\n\n9\n8\n\nR\u03bc\n\ntan \u03b2 = 50\n\n7\n6\n5\n\ntan \u03b2 = 20\n\n4\n3\n2\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nrd\nFig.4: The minimum of the ratio R\u03bc as a function of the ratio rd = dH2 /dH1 .\n\n3\n\nMass Spectrum\n\nIn order to show in detail possible mass spectra in generalized AMSB scenarios with extra\nD-term contributions to the sfermion mass parameters, we discuss two explicit examples in\nthis section.\n\n3.1\n\nA simple example\n\nFirst we consider a simple case, where additional contributions are degenerate for the\nsfermions and for the Higgs mass parameters, respectively,\nm2f \u0303 = (m2f \u0303)AM + m2D ,\n\nm2Hi = (m2Hi )AM \u2212 2m2D .\n\n(19)\n\nThis type of charge assignment can be realized through the breaking E6 \u2192 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1).\nIn the following we shall calculate mA . Note that in this example mD does not contribute\nto \u2206m2 or mA and hence the mass mA is determined by mF and tan \u03b2. The result is shown in\nFig. 5, where the region above the solid line defines the condition mA > 88 GeV. As a result,\nmF > 270 GeV is required around tan \u03b2 = 50. In most of the tan \u03b2 region, the requirement\nmA > 88 GeV is less significant than the experimental lower bound on the chargino mass,\n\n12\n\n\fmF > 210 GeV. The dotted lines in Fig. 5 correspond to mA = 250, 500, 750 and 1000 GeV,\nrespectively.\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n\nmF 500\n\n[GeV]\n\n400\n\n1000\n\n300\n\n750\n\n200\n\n500\n250\n\n100\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\nFig. 5: Lines of constant values of the CP-odd Higgs mass, mA = 88, 250, 500, 750 and 1000\nGeV, in the mF \u2013tan \u03b2 plane.\nNow we discuss the slepton masses and the Higgsino mass parameter \u03bc, in both the\nsmall and large tan \u03b2 scenarios. For example, we take tan \u03b2 = 3 and 50. Fig. 6 shows \u03bc and\nmL\u0303 for tan \u03b2 = 3. In this case the masses mL\u0303 and m\u1ebd are almost degenerate for all three\ngenerations, since the corresponding Yukawa couplings contributing to Eq. 2 are very small.\nThe dotted lines correspond to |\u03bc| = 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 TeV. The solid lines correspond\nto mL\u0303 = m\u1ebd = 85, 100, 200, 400 and 600 GeV. The region below mL\u0303 = m\u1ebd = 85 GeV is\nexcluded by present bounds on the smuon mass from the combined results of the four LEP\nexperiments [24]4 . The region to the left of the dot-solid line is excluded due to the present\nexperimental bounds on the chargino mass.\n4\n\nThe analogous lower bound on the selectron mass is about 90 GeV. The limits quoted here for slepton\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmasses include data up to s = 189 GeV. The inclusion of the latest data up to s = 202 GeV will improve\nthe bounds on smuons and selectrons by about 5 GeV, respectively. The precise value of the experimental\nbound is not crucial for the general analyses performed in this paper.\n\n13\n\n\f1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\nmD [GeV]\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\nr\nr\nM2 < 90 GeV \u2190r\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n0.5\nr\nr\nr\nr\n0.2\nr\nr\nr\n50\n100 150 200\n\n2.0\n1.5\n600\n400\n\n1.0\n\n200\n85\n\n250\n\nmF [GeV]\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFig.6: Contours of constant values for the smuon masses for mL\u0303 = m\u1ebd = 85, 200, 400, 600\nGeV (solid lines) and for \u03bc = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5 TeV (dotted lines) in the mF - mD plane, for\ntan \u03b2 = 3.\nThe first and second families of slepton masses for tan \u03b2 = 50 are almost the same\nas those for tan \u03b2 = 3. This is the case since, although the off-diagonal elements of the\nslepton mass matrices have a tan \u03b2 enhancement factor, they are also proportional to the\nfirst and second generation lepton masses which are too small. Hence, ignoring the small\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y D-term contributions, the two mass eigenstates, for the selectrons and\nsmuons are still approximately given by mL\u0303 and m\u1ebd , respectively, independent of tan \u03b2.\nOn the other hand, for large tan \u03b2 the stau mass matrix has a sizable off-diagonal element,\nwhich reduces the eigenvalue of the lightest stau mass. For the same values of the parameters\nmF and mD , the stau mass, m\u03c4\u03031 , is smaller than the first and second generation slepton\nmasses and hence it excludes a wider region of that parameter space. In the following we\nconsider the experimental lower bound on the lightest stau mass from LEP, m\u03c4\u03031 > 70GeV\n[24]. Fig. 7 shows the curves corresponding to the lightest stau mass, m\u03c4\u03031 = 70, 200, 400\nand 600 GeV, as well as the curves for constant values of |\u03bc| and the curve corresponding\nto the experimental lower bound, mL\u0303 = m\u1ebd = 85 GeV, for the smuons as a reference. The\nregion to the left of the dot-solid line corresponds to values of the CP-odd mass mA which\nare experimentally excluded by LEP. The variation of the lightest stau mass, m\u03c4\u03031 with the\n14\n\n\fsign of \u03bc is negligible. In Fig. 7 the value of |\u03bc| as a function of mF is slightly smaller than\nin the low tan \u03b2 case of Fig.6.\n1000\n\nmA <\n\n800\n\n600\n\nmD [GeV]\n400\n\n0.5\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\n88 GeV \u2190r\nr\nr\nr\nr\n1.0\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n200\n250\n300\nmF [GeV]\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\n600\n400\n200\n70\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFig.7: Contours of constant values for the stau mass, m\u03c4\u03031 = 70, 200, 400, 600 GeV for\ntan \u03b2 = 50 (thick solid lines) and for |\u03bc| = 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 TeV (dotted lines). The thin\nsolid line shows the lower experimental bound on the smuon mass, mL\u0303 \u2243 m\u1ebd \u2243 85 GeV.\nSimilarly we can discuss the predictions of this model for the stop sector. For the stop\nmixing angle \u03b8t , sin 2\u03b8t is always large. That is because m2Q\u0303 \u2212 m2\u0169 for the stop is small\ncompared with |\u03bc| as well as |At |. For example, we have sin 2\u03b8t > 0.8 for tan \u03b2 = 3,\nmF < 500 GeV and \u03bc > 0. The negative sign of \u03bc leads to a slightly larger value of sin 2\u03b8t .\nFor tan \u03b2 = 50 we have sin 2\u03b8t = 1, with mF \u2264 O(1) TeV. Figs. 8 and 9 show the lightest\nstop mass for tan \u03b2 = 3 and 50 for \u03bc < 0. The solid lines correspond to different values for\nthe lightest stop mass, mt\u03031 = 0.09, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 TeV. Present experimental bounds\nexclude the region mt\u03031 < 90 GeV [24]. In Fig. 9 (tan \u03b2 = 50), the excluded experimental\nbound on the lighetst stop mass is not shown, because it corresponds to a very narrow region\nalready excluded by the stau mass constraint. The experimental bound of the chargino mass\nexcludes the area to the left of the dot-solid curve and gives a stronger constraint, Eq. (15),\nwhich implies that the minimum of the mt\u03031 is about 500 GeV for tan \u03b2 = 3. Furthermore,\nfor tan \u03b2 = 50 we have the constraint due to mA , i.e. mF > 270 GeV, which excludes the\nregion to the left of the dot-solid line in Fig. 9. Thus, in the case of large tan \u03b2, with similar\n15\n\n\fvalues of the bottom and top Yukawa couplings, the minimum value of mt\u03031 is about 800\nGeV. The case with \u03bc > 0 leads to a slightly larger mass of the lightest stop.\nIn the case where a universal mass m0 is added to solve the problem of tachyonic solutions\nin the slepton sector, the particle spectrum is such that the lightest stop is quite heavy and\n|\u03bc| is large. Hence, the present example is phenomenologically not very different from the\nmodel with the universal m0 addition. This simple example shows two features which are\nquite generic in this type of generalized AMSB models. One is that the lightest stop is in\ngeneral quite heavy and the other is that for most tan \u03b2 values (except around tan \u03b2 = 50),\nthe chargino is predicted to be so light that present experimental bounds on chargino masses\nput constraints on the allowed values of mF , which are stronger than those derived from\ndemanding a successful electroweak symmetry breaking, with mA > 88 GeV.\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\nmD [GeV]\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\nM2 < 90 GeV \u2190r\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n0.5 r\nr\nr\nr\n0.2\nr\nr\n0.09\nr\nr\nr\n50\n100 150 200\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\nmL\u0303 < 85 GeV\n250\n\nmF [GeV]\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFig. 8: Contours of constant lightest stop mass, mt\u03031 = 0.09, 0.2, 1, 1.5 TeV, in the mD \u2013mF\nplane, for tan \u03b2 = 3 and \u03bc < 0.

We have here the same spectrum for charginos as in minimal AMSB scenarios:\nLSP wino-like and almost degenerate with the chargino making detection difficult [8, 19, 20].\nIn addition, in the region close to the region where the lightest stau mass is close to its\nexperimental limit, we may have the stau to be the LSP, although such region is narrow\nagainst mD . A charged, stable LSP is cosmologically disfavoured. However, we can avoid\nthis problem by demanding m\u03c4\u03031 > M2 and none of the features discussed in this section will\nvary in any significant manner.\n\n3.2\n\nA model with a light stop\n\nHere we consider a special case in which, by significantly shifting the degeneracy between the\nleft and right handed stop/sbottom soft SUSY breaking parameters we obtain a light stop in\nthe spectrum. Note that, in general, the supersymmetric spectrum is constrained by direct\nexperimental searches and by the requirement that it provides a good description of the\nprecision electroweak data. This requirement implies that, to avoid an unacceptable large\n17\n\n\fcontribution from supersymmetric particle loops to the \u03c1 parameter, and unless unnatural\ncancellations take place, the soft SUSY breaking mass parameters for the left-handed top\nsquark should be larger that 300 GeV [21]. Quite generally, the heavier the supersymmetric\nspectrum, and in particular the heavier the left-handed sfermions, the better the agreement\nbetween the MSSM and the precision electroweak observables. Hence, in the following, we\nshall consider a case with a light stop, which is mainly right-handed, so that the model is\nnot in any conflict with precision measurements.\nFirst, let us discuss the charge assignment leading to a light stop. We take the sign\nassignment of charges, qiX \u2261 Xi , such that m2D > 0 in eq.(5). Obviously, the minimal\n\nrequirement that m2L\u0303 > 0 and m2\u1ebd > 0 implies XL = \u2212n \u2212 p > 0 and Xe = m + p > 0,\nwhich also yields the condition XH1 = \u2212m + n < 0. In order to achieve proper electroweak\n\nsymmetry breaking, a large \u2206m2 is desirable, and then we need XH1 \u2212 XH2 = \u22122m + n \u2265 0.\nThat also implies that XH2 = m < 0. Combining all the previous conditions we have\nm > \u2212p > n \u2265 2m.\n\n(20)\n\nThe inequality XH2 < 0 requires XQ + Xu = \u2212m > 0. In order to obtain a light stop,\neither XQ or Xu should be negative. Therefore, if Q and u belong to a multiplet of a\nlarger gauge group like SU(5), (XQ = Xu ), the present scenario predicts heavy stops. If\nXQ < 0, then the lightest stop would be left-handed and most probably in conflict with\npresent constraints from precision measurements, unless its mass is sufficiently close to that\nof the left-handed lightest sbottom which would also appear in the spectrum. Alternatively,\nwe have the possibility XQ > 0 and Xu < 0, which may lead to a right-handed lightest stop.\nIn any case, most sign assignment of charges are fixed in a light stop model.\nAs an example we take (m, n, p, q) = (\u22122, \u22124, 3, \u22123), i.e.,\n(XQ , Xu , Xd , XL , Xe , XH1 , XH2 ) = (3, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22122, \u22122).\n\n(21)\n\nIn this case the CP-odd mass mA is independent of mD and the behaviour of the slepton\nmasses is similar to the case in which all the squarks are quite heavy. Figs. 10 and 11 show\nthe lightest stop mass for tan \u03b2 = 3 and 50 and \u03bc < 0. For the small tan \u03b2 case, there is an\nallowed region in the mD \u2013mF plane where, even after imposing the chargino mass bounds\n18\n\n\fon mF , mF \u2265 210 GeV, there are solutions which allow for a very light stop. In the case\n\ntan \u03b2 \u2243 50, for which m2H1 \u2243 m2H2 and a more stringent bound on mF follows from the\nexperimental bound on mA , only heavy stops are allowed unless mD \u2265 1 TeV. The solid\nlines in Fig. 10 and 11 correspond to mt\u03031 = 0.09, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 TeV. The region to the\nleft of the curve mt\u03031 = 90 GeV corresponds to the experimentally excluded region of stop\nmasses which excludes an important region of parameter space even for very large values of\nmD . The region below the dotted line, mL\u0303 < 85 GeV and m\u03c4\u0303 < 70 GeV, Figs. 10 and 11\nrespectively, is experimentally excluded. For tan \u03b2 \u2243 50 and fixed values of mD and mF , the\nlightest sbottom has a mass of similar magnitude to the lightest stop mass shown in Fig. 10.\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\nmD [GeV]\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\nr\nr\nM2 < 90 GeV \u2190r\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr 0.5\nr\n0.2\nr\n0.09\nr\nr\nr\nr\n50\n100 150 200 250 300\nmF [GeV]\n\n1.0\n\nmL\u0303 < 85 GeV\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFig. 10: Contours of the lightest stop mass, mt\u03031 = 0.09, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 TeV, (solid lines) in the\nmD \u2013mF plane, for \u03bc < 0 and tan \u03b2 = 3.

Analogous to Fig 10, the regions below the\ndotted line, to the left of the dot-solid line and to the left of the line of mt\u03031 = 90 GeV are\nexperimentally excluded.\nSimilarly, we can discuss other cases leading to a light t\u03031 . For example we can vary q\nfixing (m, n, p) = (\u22122, \u22124, 3) as in the previous case. Fig. 12 shows the lightest stop mass\nvalues as a function of mD for mF = 250 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 3, for q = \u22123, \u22124 and \u22125.\n1000\n\n800\n\nq = \u22123\n\n600\n\nmt\u03031 [GeV]\n\u22124\n\n400\n\n\u22125\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nmD [GeV]\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFig. 12 The lightest stop mass as a function of mD , for mF = 250 GeV, \u03bc < 0 and\ntan \u03b2 = 3 with q = \u22123, \u22124 and \u22125, respectively.\n20\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied phenomenological aspects of a generalization of anomaly-mediated SUSY\nbreaking scenarios with non-decoupling effects from a high scale theory, which allow for\nD-term contributions to be effective at the low energy scale. We have assumed that the\nadditional D-term contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar mass parameters,\nmi , are such that the sum m2i +m2j +m2k , corresponding to chiral fields in the allowed Yukawa\ncouplings, Y ijk 6= 0, remains RG-invariant as it occurs in the AMSB models. The extra Dterm contributions, depending on the charge assignment of the extra U(1)'s involved in the\nmodel, can solve the problem of tachyonic solutions in the slepton sector, whereas preserving\nthe flavour independence of the solutions. Most interesting, since the RG-invariant sums of\nnon vanishing Yukawa couplings Y ijk 6= 0 appear directly in the renormalization group\nevolution of the Yukawa couplings and soft SUSY breaking masses themselves, one could\nallow for additional contributions to each of the soft scalar masses and, as long as the\nsum itself is not affected, the soft scalar masses will remain RG-invariant. Given a fixed\ncharge assignment, the sparticle spectrum is uniquely determined as a function of the free\nparameters mF and mD , tan \u03b2 and the sign of \u03bc. In general, the average stop mass and\nthe parameter |\u03bc| are larger than the slepton masses and the gaugino mass parameters M1\nand M2 , as expected from the underlying AMSB structure. The mass spectrum in the most\nsimple case is similar to the case in which a universal contribution m20 is added, to all the\nsoft SUSY breaking scalar mass parameters squared, to cure the tachyonic mass problem.\nHowever, as we have explicitly shown, it is possible to construct models in which a light\nstop, compatible with present electroweak precision measurements will naturally appear in\nthe spectrum. Models with light third generation squarks demand a specific U(1) charge\nassignment and yield constraints for the model building.\n\nNote added: After completion of this work, an article [22] appeared, where D-term\ncontributions and sum rules of soft scalar masses are also discussed.\n\n21\n\n\fAcknowledgements: The work of KH is partially supported by the Academy of Finland\nproject no. 163394.\n\nReferences\n[1] See for example, H.P.
