Each of these obervables provides unique capabilities to\nstudy the reaction dynamics and taken together they form a strong and consistent picture of the\nevolving system. Based on the emission of hard photons, we argue that a strongly interacting, hot\nand dense system with temperatures above 250 MeV has to be created early in the reaction. Such\na system is bound to be different from hadronic matter and likely to be a quark-gluon plasma, and\nwe find that this assumption is in line with the subsequent evolution of the system that is reflected\nin other observables.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLattice simulations (e.g. [1]) predict that QCD undergoes a phase transformation at a temperature\nTC \u2248 150 \u2212 170 MeV [2,3] from a confined hadronic phase to a phase, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), in\nwhich quarks and gluons constitute the relevant degrees of freedom and the chiral condensate vanishes.\nExperimentally, this prediction can only be tested in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. However,\nfinding evidence, and ultimately proof, for the creation of a quark-gluon plasma faces several difficulties.\nArguably the greatest challenge is to link experimental observables to quantities measured on the lattice.\nFor a large set of observables, the evolution of the expanding medium is a key ingredient for their\ntheoretical description. It is also the place where results from lattice QCD fit in: assuming a thermalized\nsystem is created, its evolution is governed by the equation of state (EoS). Hence, in order to test\nthe lattice QCD predictions, one has to start with this assumption and show that it leads to a good\ndescription of the experimental data.\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to show that such a description can be achieved in the case of 158\nAGeV Pb-Pb and Pb-Au collisions at the CERN SPS. We summarize and expand on the results of [4\u201310]\nby developing a framework based on the EoS determined in lattice QCD. Using eikonal calculations\nto constrain the initial state and measured bulk hadronic properties to establish the final state, we\nparametrize the evolution in between in a way that is motivated by hydrodynamical calculations. We\nthen use this parametrization to calculate other observables not connected to the bulk hadronic matter\nsuch as dilepton and photon emission and charmonium suppression. In all cases, we find good agreement\nwith the data with the same set of model parameters. We explicitly discuss how each observable reflects\nunderlying scales of the evolution, to what degree information from a particular observable constrains\nalternative evolution scenarios and what we can learn about the relevant degrees of freedom in the\nmedium.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nThe fireball model framework\nExpansion and flow\n\nWe do not aim at a microscopical description of the expansion but instead at an effective parametrization\nbased on available data. In order to simplify computations, we introduce several assumptions which lead\nto an idealized picture of the expansion process. The aim of the model is to demonstrate that there is one\nset of scales characterizing the expansion that is in reasonable agreement with a large set of observables,\nnot to provide a detailed description of every observable.\nOur fundamental assumption is that an equilibrated system is formed a short proper time \u03c40 after the\nonset of the collision, which subsequently expands isentropically. As soon as the mean free path of\nparticles in the medium exceeds its dimensions, kinetic decoupling occurs at a proper time \u03c4f . The\nmatter then ceases to be in thermal equilibrium and we assume that no significant interactions occur\nlater.\nDuring the expansion phase, we posit that the entropy density of the system can be described by\ns(\u03c4, \u03b7s , r) = N R(r, \u03c4 ) * H(\u03b7s , \u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nt+z\nwith \u03c4 the co-moving proper time of a given volume element and \u03b7s = 12 ln( t\u2212z\n) the spacetime rapidity.\nR(r, \u03c4 ) and H(\u03b7s , \u03c4 ) are two functions describing the evolvingR shape of the distribution, and N is a\nnormalization factor chosen such that the total entropy is S0 = d3 rs(\u03c4, \u03b7s , r). In the above expressions\nwe have neglected angular asymmetries for collisions with a finite impact parameter, we expect their\ninfluence to be small as long as we do not discuss very peripheral collisions or observables, such as elliptic\nflow, with an explicit angular dependence.\n\nIn oder to simplify our calculations, we choose R(r, \u03c4 ) and H(\u03b7s , \u03c4 ) as box profiles R(r, \u03c4 ) = \u03b8(R(\u03c4 ) \u2212 r),\nH(\u03b7s , \u03c4 ) = \u03b8(Hs (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b7s )\u03b8(\u03b7s ) + \u03b8(\u03b7s \u2212 Hs (\u03c4 ))\u03b8(\u2212\u03b7s ). For this choice, thermodynamical parameters\nbecome functions of proper time \u03c4 only. We will later argue that this simplified choice of the distribution\nfunction gives a fair representation of the physics at midrapidity, where most observables are measured,\nbut fails to reproduce the conditions at forward rapidities. For bulk observables, like particle numbers,\nobtained by integrating over the whole volume, the detailed choice is irrelevant or reduced to a second\norder effect due to detector acceptance.\nThus, the expansion is governed by the scale parameters R(\u03c4 ) and H(\u03c4 ). Their growth with \u03c4 is a\nconsequence of collective flow of the thermalized matter. For transverse flow we assume a linear relation\nbetween radius r and transverse rapidity \u03c1 = atanh v\u22a5 (\u03c4 ) = r/Rc (\u03c4 ) * \u03c1c (\u03c4 ) with \u03c1c (\u03c4 ) = atanh a\u22a5 \u03c4 .\nThe longitudinal flow profile is dictated by the requirement that an initially homogeneous distribution\nof matter remains homogeneous at all times.\nWe start with the experimentally measured width of the rapidity interval of observed hadrons 2\u03b7ffront\nat breakup. From this, we compute the longitudinal velocity of the fireball front at kinetic freeze-out\nvffront . We do not require the initial expansion velocity v0front to coincide with vffront but instead allow\nfor a longitudinally accelerated expansion. This implies that during the evolution \u03b7 = \u03b7s where \u03b7 is the\nmomentum rapidity, is not valid . Initially, we characterize all possible trajectories of volume elements\nby a parameter c such that v0z (c) = cv0front , c \u2208 [\u22121, 1]; hence we start with an expansion that is boostinvariant over the rapidity interval \u2212atanh v0front \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 atanh v0front . For the final state, we require\natanh vffront = \u03b7ffront , i.e. the distribution has to fill the experimentally observed rapidity interval.\nIn order to match initial and final state, an acceleration term has to be introduced. We assume that\nthe acceleration is driven by the local conditions in and around a volume element (as it would be in\nhydrodynamic calculations), hence it has to be a function of proper time. To maintain a spatially\nhomogeneous distribution of matter at all times, the acceleration furthermore must correspond to a\n2\n\n\fre-scaling of the velocity field. Therefore, if az (\u03c4 ) is the acceleration acting on the fireball front, the\ntrajectory characterized by c feels the acceleration caz (\u03c4 ). This implies\nR\u03c4\nZ tp\nc * v0z + c \u03c40 az (\u03c4 \u2032 )d\u03c4 \u2032\n\u2032\nz\nR\u03c4\n1 \u2212 v z (c, \u03c4 (t\u2032 , z(t\u2032 )))2 dt\nwith\nv (c, \u03c4 ) =\n\u03c4=\n.\n(2)\n1 + v0z c2 \u03c40 az (\u03c4 \u2032 )d\u03c4 \u2032\nt0\n\nDuring the evolution, the volume element moves the distance\nZ t\nz(c, t) =\nv z (c, \u03c4 (t, z(t)))dt\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nin the c.m. frame. We solve the set of equations numerically for all values of c by integrating the\ntrajectory forward in time until a fixed \u03c4 in Eq. (2) is reached. The resulting pairs (t(c), z(c)) define a\ncurve of constant proper\nevolution time. We can compute the length of this curve using the inavriant\nR\n\u03bc\nvolume formula V = d\u03c3\u03bc u\u03bc with \u03c3\u03bc an element of the freeze-out hypersurface and\np u the four-velocity\nof matter. To good accuracy, volume elements lie on the curve \u03c4 = const. = t(c)2 \u2212 z(c)2 and the\nflow pattern can be approximated by a linear relationship between rapidity \u03b7 and spacetime rapidity \u03b7s\nas \u03b7(\u03b7s ) = \u03b7 front \u03b7s /\u03b7sfront where \u03b7sfront is computed on the c = 1 trajectory. In this case, the longitudinal\nextension in the proper volume formula yields\nL(\u03c4 ) \u2248 2\u03c4\n\nsinh (\u03b6 \u2212 1)\u03b7sfront\n(\u03b6 \u2212 1)\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03b7sfront (\u03c4 ) the spacetime rapidity of the accelerating cylinder front and \u03b6(\u03c4 ) = \u03b7 front (\u03c4 )/\u03b7sfront (\u03c4 ) the\nmismatch between spacetime rapidity and rapidity introduced by the accelerated motion. This is an\napproximate generalization of the boost-invariant relation L(\u03c4 ) = 2\u03b7 front \u03c4 which can be derived for nonaccelerated motion. The volume of the fireball at given proper time can then be found as V = \u03c0R(\u03c4 )2 L(\u03c4 )\nwhere we have neglected relativistic effects in the transverse dynamics (we have estimated that those\nare on the order of 10% at maximum for the volume and thus well within the parametric uncertainties).\nWe illustrate these concepts in Fig. 1\n2\n\n6\n\u03b7s for \u03b70 = 2.7\n\nSPS scenario\nboost-invariant expansion\n\n\u03b7 for \u03b70 = 2.7\n\n5\n\n\u03b7 = \u03b7s for \u03b70 = \u03b7F = 3.7\n\u03b7s for \u03b70 = 0.0\n\n\u03b7\n\nrapidity\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b7 for \u03b70 = 0.0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.5\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c4 [fm/c]\n\n15\n\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b7s\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 1: Left: Different scenarios for the longitudinal fireball expansion, all tuned to produce the\nsame final rapidity distribution.

For the radial expansion we\nuse\nZ \u03c4\nZ \u03c4\u2032\np(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )\n(5)\nR(\u03c4 ) = R0 + cT\nd\u03c4 \u2032\nd\u03c4 \u2032\u2032\n\u01eb(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )\n\u03c40\n\u03c40\nThe initial radius R0 is taken from overlap calculations. This leaves a parameter cT determining the\nstrength of the transverse acceleration which is also fitted to data. The final parameter characterizing\nthe expansion is its endpoint given by \u03c4f , the breakup proper time of the system. It is determined by\nthe condition that the temperature T (\u03c4 ) drops below the freeze-out temperature TF .\n\n2.3\n\nThermodynamics\n\nWe calculate the total entropy S0 by fixing the entropy per baryon from the number of produced\nparticles per unit rapidity and the number of participant baryons [4,11]. Assuming isentropic expansion\nthe entropy density s at a given proper time is then determined by s = S0 /V (\u03c4 ).\nWe describe the EoS in the partonic phase by a quasiparticle interpretation of lattice data which has been\nshown to reproduce lattice results both at vanishing baryochemical potential \u03bcB [12] and finite \u03bcB [13]\nand is able to extrapolate the lattice results obtained with quark masses m \u223c T down to physical masses.\nFor a thermalized hot hadronic system near the phase transition, lattice computations of the EoS offer\nlittle guidance since the quark masses and hence the hadron masses are still unphysically large. On the\nother hand, many of the hadronic states relevant close to the phase transition are poorly known and\na first principle calculation of the thermodynamics of an interacting hadron gas near this point faces\nserious difficulties. We circumvent the problem by calculating thermodynamic properties of a hadron\ngas at kinetic decoupling where interactions cease to be important and an ideal gas is presumably a valid\ndescription. Determining the EoS at this point using the statistical hadronization described in section\n3, we choose a smooth interpolation between decoupling temperature TF and transition temperature TC\nto the EoS obtained in the quasiparticle description.\nUsing the EoS and s(\u03c4 ), we compute the parameters p(\u03c4 ), \u01eb(\u03c4 ) and T (\u03c4 ). Since the ratio p(\u03c4 )/\u01eb(\u03c4 )\nappears in the expansion parametrization, we solve the model self-consistently by iteration.\n\n2.4\n\nSolving the model\n\nSeveral of the model parameters are fixed by measurements, such as the total entropy S0 or the final\nrapidity interval \u03b7ffront . Others are calculated, such as the initial transverse overlap radius R0 or the\nnumber of participant nucleons Npart which are obtained by eikonal calculations. Only the initial rapidity\ninterval \u03b7 front (\u03c40 ) (via cz ), the final transverse velocity v\u22a5 (\u03c4f ) (via cT ) and the freeze-out temperature\nTF are fit parameters and adjusted to the hadronic momentum spectra and HBT correlations. Thus,\ntotal multiplicity is governed by the input S0 , the relative multiplicity of different particle species is\ncalculated in a statistical hadronization framework (see section 3) whereas the shape of the transverse\nmass spectra and the HBT radii determine the transverse and longitudinal expansion parameters and the\nfreeze-out temperature. The equilibration time \u03c40 cannot be obtained from fits to hadronic observables\nwhich reflect the final state; for the time being we choose \u03c40 = 1 fm/c and discuss variations of this\nparameter later.\n\n4\n\n\f2.5\n\nParticle emission and HBT\n\nWe calculate particle emission throughout the whole lifetime of the fireball by evaluating the Cooper-Frye\nformula\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u03bc\nZ\nd3 N\ng\np u \u03bc \u2212 \u03bci\n\u03bc\nE 3 =\n= d4 xS(x, p)\n(6)\nd\u03c3\u03bc p exp\nd p\n(2\u03c0)3\nTf\nwith p\u03bc the momentum of the emitted particle and g its degeneracy factor from the fireball surface. For\nemission hypersurfaces with a spacelike normal we include a \u03b8-function preventing emission from the\nsurface back into the system. Note that the factor d\u03c3\u03bc p\u03bc contains the spacetime rapidity \u03b7s and the\nfactor p\u03bc u\u03bc the rapidity \u03b7. Since these are in general not the same in our model, the analytic expressions\nvalid for a boost-invariant scenario [15] do not apply.\nPionic HBT correlation radii are obtained using the common Cartesian parametrization for spin 0 particles\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\n2\n2\nC(q, K) \u2212 1 = exp \u2212qo2 Rout\n(K) \u2212 qs2 Rside\n(K) \u2212 ql2 Rlong\n(K) \u2212 2qo ql Rol\n(K)\n(7)\n\n(see e.g. [16, 17] for an overview and further references) for the correlator.

The model is able to calculate the magnitude of this contribution using statistical hadronization\nbut not its mt distribution, therefore it is left out when we compare with data. This explains the\nmismatch at low transverse mass and that the integrated spectrum does not yield the multiplicity\nindicated by the data. The same is visible in the K\u2212 spectrum, albeit less pronounced. Apart from this\naspect, the model describes the transverse mass spectra well.\nThe fact that particles inside the fireball volume are characterized by a thermal momentum distribution\nleads to a smearing of the box-profile in rapidity when particle emission is calculated, therefore the\nresulting \u03c0 \u2212 distribution in rapidity does not exhibit a sharp cutoff. The deviation from the data at\nforward rapidities is caused by the simplifying assumption of a homogeneous rapidity density, it is not\na failure of the framework as such and indicates that this approximation should not be used for y > 1.5.\nWe illustrate this by replacing the box density distribtion in rapidity with a Woods-Saxon distribution\nwith a skin thickness parameter \u2206y = 0.37 which dramatically improves the agreement with the data.\nWe have checked that this choice does not significantly alter the transverse mass spectra at y = 0.\nThe resulting HBT correlation parameters are shown in Fig. 3. In general, the agreement with the data\nis good, however the low kt region seems to be underestimated. Note however that our calculation does\nnot contain the model independent correction terms which tend to increase the correlation radii for small\nmomenta (see our results in [10]) and that the experimental data do not include systematic errors.\n5\n\n\f200\n-\n\n3\n\n-2\n\n1/mt dN/dmt [GeV ]\n\n10\n\nNA49 \u03c0 data\nmodel calculation\n\u03c0\nNA49 K data\nmodel calculation K\n\n150\n\n2\n\ndN/dy\n\n10\n\n-\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\nNA49 \u03c0 data\nmodel calculation\nWoods-Saxon distribution\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nmt - m0[GeV]\n\n0.8\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\ny\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: Transverse mass spectra of \u03c0 \u2212 and K\u2212 measured by NA49 [18] compared with the\nmodel results.

Fig. 4 shows the resulting temperature evolution\nin proper time and compares it with the previous fit results based on older data used in [4\u20136, 8, 9].\nThe difference between the two fits is not large - the new data require a slightly larger v0front , leading to\na reduced initial temperature, but this change is well within the model uncertainties. A more pronounced\nf\ndifference shows up in the late hadronic evolution where a larger v\u22a5\nis required, leading to faster cooling\nand a reduced lifetime in the new fit. Surprisingly, this amounts to an increase of the four-volume of\nthe hadronic phase of about 5%, the shorter time duration is slightly outweighed by a faster volume\nincrease.\nBased only on a fit to hadronic observables, we thus find a system which is characterized by a sizeable\ninitial compression of matter with subsequent re-expansion (v0front < vffront ). This has several important\nconsequences: First, any estimate of the initial temperature or total lifetime based on a boost-invariant\nexpansion such as the well-known relation Rlong = \u03c4f (TF /mt )1/2 connecting Rlong with the breakup\ntime [21] does not apply. Instead, a system undergoing accelerated longitudinal expansion is initially\nmore strongly compressed (implying a larger initial energy density and temperature) and takes more time\nto expand to a given volume while arriving at the observed longitudinal flow. Hence, the four-volume of\nsuch a system is also larger than in the standard boost-invariant expansion scenario. We argue later that\nthe difference between the two cases is experimentally accessible by measuring electromagnetic probes.\nFor the discussion of some observables, we require the fireball evolution for other than 5% central\ncollisions. In this case, we scale the total entropy with the number of collision participants and reduce\nthe initial radius of the system to reproduce the smaller overlap area of the nuclei while neglecting the\nangular asymmetry. Keeping the parameter c\u22a5 at its value, the reduced entropy leads to an earlier\nfreeze-out and hence naturally reduces transverse flow. For the initial longitudinal motion, we linearly\ninterpolate between the value found for central collisions and the observed rapidity loss in p-p collisions\n(where no re-expansion occurs) in the number of collision participants and refit cz accordingly.\n6\n\n\f6\n\n6\nCERES data\nmodel calculation\n\n5.5\n\n5\nRout [fm]\n\nRside [fm]\n\n5\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\n3\n0\n\nCERES data\nmodel calculation\n\n5.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nkt [GeV]\n\n0.6\n\n3\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nkt [GeV]\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n8\nCERES data\nmodel calculation\n\n7\n\nCERES data\nmodel calculation\n\n6\n\nRout/Rside\n\nRlong [fm]\n\n1.1\n\n5\n\n0.9\n\n4\n3\n0\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nkt [GeV]\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nkt [GeV]\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 3: HBT Correlation radii obtained by the CERES collaboration [19] as a function of transverse pair momentum kt compared with the model results. No systematic errors are included in the\nexperimental errorbars.\n\n3\n\nStatistical hadronization at the phase boundary\n\nIn order to connect the fireball entropy with the measured particle spectra, we have to specify how\na hadronic system at the phase boundary is created. Statistical models are extremely successful in\ndescribing the measured ratios of different hadron species for a range of collision energies from SIS to\nRHIC (see e.g. [22\u201325]).\nThe basic assumption of statistical hadronization is that the particle content of the fireball can be found\nby considering a system of (non-interacting) hadrons in chemical equilibrium at TC , described by the\ngrand canonical ensemble, which subsequently undergoes decay processes. This ensemble is characterized\nby the temperature TC , the baryochemical potential \u03bcB and the strange potential \u03bcs . In the present\nmodel framework, we can calculate all these parameters from the fireball evolution and obtain hadron\nratios parameter-free.\nEmploying the grand canonical ensemble, the density for each particle species ni is given by\nZ \u221e\ndi\np2 dp\nni =\n.\n2\u03c0 2 0 exp{[Ei (p) \u2212 \u03bci ]/TC } \u00b1 1\n\n(10)\n\nHere, di denotes the degeneracy factor of particle species i (spin, isospin, particle / antiparticle), the\n7\n\n\f0.3\n\nnew fit\nold fit\n\nT [GeV]\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nTC\n\n0.15\nTF\n\n0.1\n0\n\n10\n\u03c4 [fm/c]\n\n5\n\n15\n\nFigure 4: Temperature evolution of the fireball for SPS 158 AGeV 5% centeral Pb-Pb collisions, shown\nare the old fit used in [4\u20136, 8, 9] and the scenario based on recent data presented in this work.\np\n+(-) sign is used for fermions (bosons) and Ei (p) = m2i + p2 . mi stands for the particle's vacuum\nmass. We use a value of 170 MeV for the critical temperature TC as determined in lattice calculations\nfor two light and one heavy flavours [2, 3]. The chemical potential \u03bci = \u03bcB Bi \u2212 \u03bcS Si takes care of\nconserved baryon number Bi and strangeness Si for each species and we neglect a (small) contribution\n\u2212\u03bcI3 Ii3 coming from the isospin asymmetry. The conservation of the number of participant baryons\nNpart and the requirement of vanishing net strangeness uniquely determines \u03bcB and \u03bcS for a given\nvolume V = V (TC ). This volume can be calculated as V (TC ) = Stot /s(TC ) with s(TC ) determined by\nthe EoS in the partonic phase, thus linking the model calculation again with lattice results.\nWe include all mesons and mesonic resonances up to masses of 1.5 GeV and all baryons and baryonic\nresonances up to masses of 2 GeV in the model and calculate their decay into particles which are stable\nor long-lived as compared to the fireball, such as \u03c0, K, \u03b7, N, \u039b, \u03a3 and \u03a9. In order to account for repulsive\ninteractions between particles at small distances we assume a hard core radius RC of 0.3 fm (based\non results for p-p collisions [26]) for all particles and resonances and correct for the excluded volume\nself-consistently. Particle and resonance properties are taken from [27]. For resonances with large width,\nwe integrate Eq.

The ratios are (for given\nTC ) determined by the volume which in turn determines \u03bcB . We may infer from this agreement that the\nvalue of TC as measured on the lattice is, in combination with the statistical hadronization approach,\ncompatible with the data and that the EoS, via s(TC ), leads to a reasonable volume at the phase\ntransition. Therefore, hadron ratios are insensitive to the spacetime expansion parametrized in the\nmodel but test mainly properties of the EoS.\nThe main impact of the results on the fireball evolution is via the EoS: Decay processes of high-lying\nresonances created at TC lead to on overpopulation of pion phase space during the evolution in the\nhadronic phase when strong decay processes are still in equilibrium with their back reaction but weak\ndecays are not. This effect has a crucial influence on the EoS and we incorporate it by allowing for a\nfinite pion chemical potential \u03bc\u03c0 (\u03c4 ) that rises to good approximation linearly in proper time from 0 at\n\u03c4 = \u03c4C to 110 MeV at \u03c4 = \u03c4f (cf. [39]).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nElectromagnetic observables\nDilepton emission\n\nThe lepton pair emission rate from a hot domain populated by particles in thermal equilibrium at\ntemperature T is proportional to the imaginary part of the spin-averaged photon self-energy, with these\nparticles as intermediate states. The thermally excited particles annihilate to yield a time-like virtual\nphoton with four-momentum q which decays subsequently into a lepton-antilepton pair. The differential\npair production rate is given by [40]\ndN\nd4 xd4 q\n\n=\n\n1\n\u03b12 R(q, T )\n\u03b12\nIm\n\u03a0\u0304(q,\nT\n)\n=\n,\n\u03bcu\n\u03bc\n\u03b2q\n3\n2\n\u03bc \u2212 1\n\u03c0 q e\n12\u03c0 4 e\u03b2q u\u03bc \u2212 1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = e2 /4\u03c0, \u03b2 = 1/T , u\u03bc the four-velocity of the emitting volume element and we have neglected\nthe lepton masses. We have defined \u03a0\u0304(q) = \u2212\u03a0\u03bc\u03bc /3 and introduce the averaged photon spectral function\nR(q, T ) = (12\u03c0/q 2 ) Im\u03a0\u0304(q, T ). Here \u03a0\u03bc\u03bc denotes the trace over the thermal photon self-energy which is\nequivalent to the thermal current-current correlation function\nZ\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (q, T ) = i d4 x eiqx hT j\u03bc (x)j\u03bd (0)i\u03b2 ,\n(12)\nwhere j\u03bc is the electromagnetic current. Eq.(11) is valid to leading order in the electromagnetic interaction and to all orders in the strong interaction. The information about the strong interaction dynamics\nis now encoded in the spectral function. For its computation, we have to use different techniques for\ndealing with partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom.\n4.1.1\n\nSpectral function in the QGP phase\n\nAs long as the thermodynamically active degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons, the timelike photon\ncouples to the continuum of thermally excited qq states and subsequently converts into a charged lepton\npair. The calculation of the photon spectral function at the one-loop level is performed using standard\nthermal field theory methods.

This result, however, is modified by perturbative\ncorrections in \u03b1s that take into account interactions in the plasma.\nWe compute these within our quasiparticle description [12, 13]. Here, the degrees of freedom in the partonic phase acquire an effective temperature dependent mass m(T ). Furthermore, the effect of confinement near the phase transition is parametrized by a reduction factor C(T ) multiplying the distribution\nfunctions (see references for details).\nIt is straightforward to insert thermal masses instead of bare quark masses into Eq. 13. C(T ) is equivalent\nto a fugacity factor, it describes the reduced occupation of available states for quarks and antiquarks\nin the medium due to confinement. Since Eq. 13 describes the annihilation of a qq pair into a virtual\nphoton, the probability of finding a quark and antiquark in the medium is reduced by a factor C(T )2 in\nthis approximation.\n4.1.2\n\nSpectral function in the hadronic phase\n\nBelow TC , confinement sets in and the effective degrees of freedom change to colour singlet, bound q q\u0304\nor qqq (q\u0304 q\u0304 q\u0304) states. The photon couples now to the lowest-lying dipole excitations of the vacuum, the\nhadronic J P = 1\u2212 states: the \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons and multi-pion states carrying these same quantum\nnumbers. There is a considerable uncertainty in the calculation of properties of hadronic matter near\nthe phase boundary. In order to minimize the theoretical uncertainty, we compare several different\napproaches:\nThe first approach (referred to as 'chiral model' in the following) is based on [41, 42, 44]: The electromagnetic current-current correlation function can be computed from an effective Lagrangian which\napproximates the SU (3) flavour sector of QCD at low energies. An appropriate model for our purposes\nis the Improved Vector Meson Dominance model combined with chiral dynamics of pions and kaons as\ndescribed in [43]. Within this model, the following relation between the imaginary part of the irreducible\nphoton self-energy Im\u03a0\u0304 and the vector meson self-energies \u03a0V (q) in vacuum is derived:\n\u0001\nX Im\u03a0V (q)\n1 \u2212 g/gV0 q 2 \u2212 m2V\n2\n|F\n(q)|\n,\nF\n(q)\n=\n,\n(14)\nIm\u03a0\u0304(q) =\nV\nV\ngV2\nq 2 \u2212 m2V + iIm\u03a0V (q)\nV\n\nwhere mV are the (renormalized) vector meson masses, gV0 is the \u03b3V coupling and g is the vector meson\ncoupling to the pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c0 0 and K \u00b1 , K 0 . Eq.(14) is valid for a virtual photon\nwith vanishing three-momentum q. For finite three-momenta there exist two scalar functions \u03a0\u0304L and\n\u03a0\u0304T , because the existence of a preferred frame of reference (the heat bath) breaks Lorentz invariance,\nand one has to properly average over them. However, for simplicity we approximate the problem by\ntaking the limit |q| \u2192 0 and test this approximation later in a different approach.\nFinite temperature modifications of the vector meson self-energies appearing in eq.(14) are calculated\nusing thermal Feynman rules. The explicit calculations for the \u03c1- and \u03c6-meson can be found in [41].\n10\n\n\fThe thermal spectral function of the \u03c9-meson is discussed in detail in [42]. The \u03c1 mass is not shifted\nexplicitly in the approach.\nFor the evaluation of finite baryon density effects which are relevant at SPS conditions, we use the results\ndiscussed in [44]. There it was shown that in the linear density approximation, \u03a0V is related to the\nvector meson - nucleon scattering amplitude. In the following, we assume that the temperature- and\ndensity-dependences of \u03a0V factorize. This amounts to neglecting contributions from matrix elements\nsuch as h\u03c0N |T j\u03bc (x)j \u03bc (0)|\u03c0N i describing nucleon-pion scatterings where the pion comes from the heat\nbath.\nOur second approach [9] (referred to as 'mean field model' in the following) is based on a different idea:\nThe method of thermofield dynamics [45] is used here to calculate the state with minimum thermodynamic potential, at finite temperature and density within the mean field sigma model with a quartic\nscalar self interaction. The temperature and density dependent baryon and sigma masses are calculated\nself-consistently. The medium modification to the masses of the \u03c9- and \u03c1-mesons in hot nuclear matter\nincluding the quantum correction effects are then calculated in the relativistic random phase approximation. The decay widths for the mesons are calculated from the imaginary part of the self energy using\nthe Cutkosky rule.\nIn a third approach (referred to as '\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1-model' in the following) [46], we solve truncated SchwingerDyson equations of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 system in a self-consistent resummation scheme, neglecting the effects of\nother hadrons. This approach takes into account the finite in-medium damping width of the pion which\ncontributes substantially to the broadening of the \u03c1-meson. As an additional benefit, we can use this\nmodel to study the effects of neglecting the q dependence of the spectral function in chiral model.\n4.1.3\n\nThe measured spectrum\n\nThe differential rate of Eq.(11) is integrated over the space-time history of the collision to compare\nthe calculated dilepton rates with the CERES/NA45 data [47] taken in Pb-Au collisions at 158 AGeV\n\u221a\n(corresponding to a c.m. energy of sN N \u223c 17 AGeV). The CERES experiment is a fixed-target\nexperiment. In the lab frame, the CERES detector covers the limited rapidity interval \u03b7 = 2.1 \u2212 2.65,\ni.e. \u2206\u03b7 = 0.55. We integrate the calculated rates over the transverse momentum pT and average over\n\u03b7. The resulting formula for the space-time- and p-integrated dilepton rates is\n2\u03c0M\nd2 N\n=\ndM d\u03b7\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nZ\u03c4f\n\n\u03c40\n\n\u03c4 d\u03c4 2\u03c0\n\nR(\u03c4\nZ )\n\n\u03b7f ront\nZ (\u03c4 )\n\nrdr\n\n0\n\nsinh(\u03b6 \u2212 1)\nd\u03b7s\n(\u03b6 \u2212 1)\n\n\u2212\u03b7f ront (\u03c4 )\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndpT pT\n\ndN (T (\u03c4 ), M, \u03b7(\u03b7s ), pT )\nAcc(M, \u03b7, pT ),\nd4 xd4 p\n\n0\n\n(15)\nwhere the function Acc(M, \u03b7, pT ) accounts for the experimental acceptance cuts specific to the detector.\nIn the CERES experiment, each electron/positron track is required to have a transverse momentum\npT > 0.2 GeV, to fall into the rapidity interval 2.1 < \u03b7 < 2.65 in the lab frame and to have a pair\nopening angle \u0398ee > 35 mrad. Finally, for comparison with the CERES data, the resulting rate is\ndivided by dNch /d\u03b7, the rapidity density of charged particles.\nIn addition to the thermal emission of dileptons, we also consider dileptons from decays of vector mesons\n\u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 after the kinetic decoupling of the fireball. We calculate their yields using the statistical hadronization model outlined in section 3 and use their vacuum spectral functions to calculate the resulting dilepton\nyield.\n\n11\n\n\f4.1.4\n\nResults\n\nThe invariant mass spectrum of dileptons is a Lorentz-invariant quantity and hence independent of flow\nand roughly proportional to the radiating 4-volume in the hadronic phase. This explains the negligible\ndifferences between the old and the new analysis in spite of the fact that the refitted evolution scenario\nexhibits stronger transverse flow and has a reduced lifetime.\nThe calculated spectrum is in fair agreement with the data for all three spectral functions (see Fig. 6);\nthe mean field model seems superior to the chiral model in the description of the invariant mass region below 300 MeV, however, the general magnitude of dilepton emission is well reproduced by both\nspectral functions. As Fig. 6 (right) indicates, a purely pionic medium is also able to account for a\nsufficient broadening of the \u03c1 meson if the pion damping width is taken into account in a self-consistent\nresummation scheme instead of using a perturbative expansion.\nNeglecting the momentum dependence in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 model to overestimates the data in the low invariant\nmass region. This is the same trend seen in the chiral model and suggests that including the momentum\ndependence there would probably also improve the agreement with the data.\n\n-1\n\n(d Nee/d\u03b7 dM)/(dNch/d\u03b7) [(100 MeV) ]\n\n0.0001\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-08\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\nCERES data 158 AGeV\nSelf-consistent \u03c0\u2212\u03c1 model\nneglecting 3-momentum dep.\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(d Nee/d\u03b7 dM)/dNch/d\u03b7) [100 MeV)\n\n-1\n\nCERES data 158 AGeV\nChiral model\nMean Field model\n\n1e-05\n\n10\n\n1e-09\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n-9\n\n10 0\n\n2\n\nInvariant mass [GeV]\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nInvariant mass [GeV]\n\nFigure 6: Left panel: The dilepton spectrum compared with SPS 158 Pb-Au results [47] (dots) using\nboth the Chiral model (dashed) and the Mean Field model (solid) spectral function.

Note that although the Mean Field model spectral function does\nnot contain the \u03c6 meson and the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 model contains neither \u03c9 nor \u03c6, vacuum decays of these mesons\nare nevertheless included and lead to distinct peaks in the spectrum. In both plots we did not fold our\nresult with the finite energy resolution of the detector, this explains the apparent disagreement of the\nsharp \u03c6 and \u03c9 vacuum decay peaks with the data.\nTo gain additional insight into the underlying physics, we convolute the chiral model result with the\nfinite energy resolution of the detector and indicate the individual contributions to the measured rate\nseparately. This is shown in Fig. 7. The decomposition for the Mean Field model is very similar.\nThe dominant contribution to the complete rate in the invariant mass region below 1 GeV comes from\nthermalized hadronic matter, and here by far the strongest contribution from the \u03c1. For both the Chiral\nand the Mean Field model calculation, the inclusion of finite baryon density effects (which manifest\nthemselves in N-\u03c1 scattering processes) is crucial for achieving agreement with data [4, 9]. Both calculations take these into account. The success of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 model suggests, however, that even for vanishing\nbaryon density the \u03c1-meson may be sufficiently broadened to explain the data.\n\n12\n\n\f10\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\n(d Nee/d\u03b7dM)/(dNch/d\u03b7) [(100 MeV) ]\n\n10\n\n-4\n\ncocktail\nQGP\ntotal rate\nDrell-Yan\nNA45\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-4\n\ntotal rate\n\u03c1-meson\n\u03c9-meson\n\u03c6-meson\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n(d Nee/d\u03b7dM)/(dNch/d\u03b7) [(100 MeV) ]\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10 0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\ninvariant mass M [GeV]\n\ninvariant mass M [GeV]\n\nFigure 7: Left panel: Dilepton emission rate in the Chiral model folded with the energy resolution of\nthe detector (thick solid) compared with SPS 158 AGeV Pb-Au results (solid circles).

Right panel: The total thermal\nemission rate from hadronic degrees of freedom (solid), decomposed into contributions from \u03c1 (dashed),\n\u03c9 (long dashed) and \u03c6 (dotted).\nThe QGP contribution is only visible above 1 GeV invariant mass, however here the large errors do\nnot allow any firm conclusion about its magnitude. As is apparent from Fig. 7, the QGP contribution\nis unable to explain the enhancement of the dilepton spectrum below 600 MeV invariant mass. Thus\na dilepton measurement at SPS is dominantly sensitive to the in-medium mass modifications of vector\nmesons. While those are interesting problems in their own right, it implies that the dilepton measurement\nat CERES does not directly help to clarify the question if the quark-gluon plasma has been formed.\nThe importance of thermal contributions from the hadronic phase serves as a reminder that interactions\ndo not cease to be important after the phase transition. Any type of model assuming kinetic freeze-out\nat the phase transition would have to find a different mechanism of producing the required amount of\ndilepton radiation below the \u03c1 peak - clearly, the QGP contribution alone is insufficient to explain the\nenhancement. On the other hand, the fact that the hadronic spectral functions we have investigated\nlie on the upper and lower bound of the error bars below 0.5 GeV invariant mass indicates that the\nhadronic contribution (dictated by the four-volume of the radiating matter) is of the correct order of\nmagnitude. If the radiating 4-volume were less than half of the value in the present model, the calculated\nhadronic emission spectrum would not be sufficient to explain the data. This strongly disfavours large\nfreeze-out temperatures and a short lifetime of the hadronic phase (although for sufficient transverse\nflow, a large emitting 4-volume could still be achieved in spite of a small lifetime; the measured hadron\nspectra, however, rule out such a combination).\n\n4.2\n4.2.1\n\nPhoton emission\nThe emission rate\n\nFor the emission rate of direct photons, we use the complete O(\u03b1s ) calculation [48\u201354] in the form of\nthe parameterization provided in [54]. Using arguments analoguous to the ones in the case of dilepton\nemission, we incorporate the effect of the quasiparticle description into this equation by a factor C(T )2 .\nFor the photon emission rate from hadronic matter, we use a parametrization of the rate from a hot\n13\n\n\fhadronic gas taken from [55].\n4.2.2\n\nThe emission spectrum\n\nThe spectrum of emitted photons can be found by folding the rate [54] with the fireball evolution. In\norder to account for flow, the energy of a photon emitted with momentum k \u03bc = (kt , kt , 0) has to be\nevaluated in the local rest frame of matter, giving rise to a product k \u03bc u\u03bc with u\u03bc (\u03b7s , r, \u03c4 ) the local flow\nprofile as decribed in section 2. For comparison with the measured photon spectrum [56], we present the\ndifferential emission spectrum into the midrapidity slice y = 0.

Right panel: The calculated photon spectrum (solid), the spectrum assuming\nboost-invariant longitudinal expansion (dashed) and assuming formation times 0.5 fm/c (dash-dotted)\nand 3 fm/c (dotted) in comparison with the data [56].\nThe overall agreement with the data is remarkably good. We observe that the relatively large transverse\nflow in the hadronic phase in the present scenario leads to a rather flat contribution with a shape\nsimilar to the QGP contribution but smaller. For the standard choice \u03c40 = 1 fm/c the calculation\nseems to underestimate the data slightly in the high momentum tail, but yields a good description over\nthe whole range 1.5 GeV < kt < 3 GeV. The errors allow for a prompt photon contribution of about\nhalf of the magnitude of the thermal yield for the whole momentum range. Note that the spectrum is\nalmost completely saturated by the QGP contribution - the hadronic contribution is about an order of\nmagnitude down.\nIn order to study the influence of the equilibration time \u03c40 and hence the initial temperature, we present\nmodel calculations for the choices \u03c40 = 0.5 fm/c and \u03c40 = 3 fm/c in fig. 8 (right). Clearly, a late\nequilibration fails to account for the data in the momentum region between 2 and 2.5 fm/c where prompt\nphotons are not expected to play an important role (cf. the discussion in [6]). On the other hand, an\nequilibration as early as 0.5 fm/c (corresponding to an initial temperature of 370 MeV) produces too\nmany photons. The direct photon spectrum thus constrains the initial equilibration time at SPS energies\nto be close to 1 fm/c.\nWe may finally use the photon emission rate to test the validity of our fireball model. Tentatively\nassuming a standard boost-invariant expansion pattern with \u03b70front = \u03b7ffront , we calculate the resulting\n\n14\n\n\fphoton emission. This is also shown in Fig. 8, right panel. The rapid cooling and the consequently shortlived QGP phase for such a scenario lead to a severe disagreement with data that cannot be compensated\nfor by any choice of equilibration time above 0.1 fm/c. Any initial state photon emission is bound to\nfill the larger kt region of the emission spectrum and cannot properly compensate for the reduction of\nradiating four-volume at moderate temperatures (below 250 MeV) in the boost-invariant scenario. We\nconclude that longitudinal compression and re-expansion of matter with all its consequences is essential\nfor the calculated thermal photon yield to be compatible with the data and that the analysis indicates\na rather quick equilibration.\n\n5\n\nCharmonium suppression\n\nIt is often argued that the breakup of bound cc states immersed into hot and dense matter is a good signal\nfor the creation of a QGP. We investigate this question within the framework of our fireball evolution\nmodel. We refer to J/\u03a8 and the excited states \u03a8\u2032 and \u03c7c generically as \u03a8 in the following. Details\nof our treatment of the excited states can be found in [8]. Our main assumption is that charmonia\nthemselves are not thermalized. This is motived by the observation that the mass scale of charm quarks\nis well above the temperature scale even for the initial conditions. The thermal production of cc pairs\nis therefore negligible and the momentum transfer from produced charm quarks to light constituents of\nthe heat bath is not very efficient.\nBased on this assumption, we will treat the formation and breakup of bound charmonia as an offequilibrium process and use kinetic theory to calculate the evolution of the \u03a8 density. This corresponds\nto the treatment in [57]. We will here limit the discussion to \u03a8 dissociation in the QGP phase in the\nfollowing because the density of scatterers in the medium as a function of temperature in the hadronic\nphase is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the QGP phase [8]. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 which\nshows the particle density.

For later use we need the pT\nspectrum of \u03a8 at mid-rapidity. In the following we assume a Gaussian form for the pT -dependent\npart, with width parameter \u039b = 1 GeV/c. The rapidity modulation can be inferred from the relation\n15\n\n\fd\u03c3/dy\u221a\u223c x1 g(x1 ) x2 g(x2 ) where xg(x) \u223c (1 \u2212 x)5 is the gluon distribution in the proton and x1,2 =\n(m\u03a8 / s) exp(\u00b1y). For the overall normalization we use the parametrization for the total charmonium\nproduction cross section [58]\n\u221a\n\u03a8\n(16)\n\u03c3pp\n(s) = 2 \u03c30 (1 \u2212 m\u03a8 / s)n ,\nwhere \u03c30 = 1.28 \u03bcb and n = 12.\nWe now consider nuclear effects, starting with the simpler case of proton-nucleus (pA) collisions.

The absorption cross section parametrizes various poorly known effects, with varying\nimportance depending on the collision energy. Among these effects are the presence of color degrees of\nfreedom in the dynamics of colliding nucleons, initial state parton energy loss and coherence length and\nshadowing effects. A common property of all of the above is the linear dependence on the path length,\nat least to leading order. Using eq.

The threshold energy is related to the binding energy \u01eb0 by the condition that\n2\n2\ns = (p + k)2 >\n\u223c 4mc which implies that \u01eb = \u01eb0 + \u01eb0 /(2m\u03a8 ). In the following we assume \u01eb0 = 780 MeV\nfor the binding energy and \u03bcc = 1.95 GeV for the mass as in [60] to fit the mass values of the first two\nlevels (J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 ) of the charmonium system.\n\n5.3\n\nResults\n\nWe combine the building blocks described above to compute the suppression as a function of impact\nparameter b. The result is divided by the number of binary collisions Ncoll , which provides the centrality\ndependence of the Drell-Yan cross section. The normalization is fixed at Ncoll = 53.5 to match, at\nlarge b, the experimental value in p-p collisions and the ratio \u03a8/DY as function of b is converted into\na function of the measured transverse energy assuming ET (b) = \u01ebT Npart (b). The quantity \u01ebT = 0.297,\nwhich represents the amount of produced transverse energy per participant, is used in order to describe\ncorrectly the total inelastic (minibum-bias) cross section as function of centrality. In this way we arrive\nat the results plotted in Fig. 10.\nThe agreement with data is quite remarkable but deserves some comments. First, the curves end at\nET \u2248 110 GeV, which corresponds to b = 0. To go beyond this value it is necessary to include effects\nof fluctuations, which are in principle straightforward to address [61]. However, as the analysis in [62]\nsuggests, fluctuations do not alter the results below this value substantially, therefore such an extension\nof the model would not yield new information about the scales of the spacetime expansion of the fireball,\nthe main issue under investigation in this paper.\nThe agreement of our curve with the data down to ET = 40 GeV is remarkable given the fact that we\nuse rather simple scaling laws [8] to model the impact parameter dependence of the fireball evolution.\nOn the other hand, the deviation from the date for ET < 40 GeV is not surprising, because the thermal\nequilibrium assumption is bound to fail for very peripheral collisions.\nIt is reassuring that the model is able to describe the data over a wide range, however there are still considerable uncertainties regarding the excited \u03a8 states, the magnitude of the 'ordinary' nuclear suppression\nand the magnitude of the production cross section for nucleus-nucleus collisions (cf. [8]). Therefore, we\nrefrain from deriving constraints for the model framework from this observable and note only that the\nsame early evolution which describes the photon data also agrees well with the charmonium suppression\ndata.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nUnder the assumption that a thermalized system is created in 158 AGeV Pb-Pb collisions at SPS, we\nhave analyzed a schematic model based on the thermodynamic response of matter to a volume expansion.\n17\n\n\f60\n\nSPS\n\n50\n\nNA50 '96\nNA50 '98\n\n\u03a8 / DY\n\n40\n\nNUC\nQGP\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nET\n\n80\n[GeV]\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nFigure 10: Result at SPS energy for the ratio \u03a8/DY as function of the transverse energy. The dashed\ncurve includes only nuclear effects, while the full line is the complete result including gluon dissociation\nThis model provides the link between the EoS as obtained in lattice QCD and measured observables. We\nhave derived essential evolution scales by the requirement that the model should reproduce the measured\nproperties of hadron emission.\nVarious other sets of observables provide unique opportunities to verify these essential scales. Discussing\nstatistical hadronization, we find that the crucial quantity in our approach is given by s(TC ), the entropy\ndensity at the phase transition. This quantity is an input from lattice QCD and agrees nicely with the\nobserved hadon ratios.\nA calculation of dilepton emission shows that most of the observed dilepton excess above the 'cocktail'\nof final state meson decays can be explained by radiation from a thermalized hadron gas. The main\ncontribution here stems from a strongly broadened \u03c1-meson. Thus, we find evidence for ongoing interactions even below the phase transition temperature. The total amount of radiating space-time-volume\nin our model description is in good agreement with the measured amount of radiation.\nThe measurement of high-momentum photons gives complementary information: The large momentum\nscale makes this observable sensitive to the initial state of the collision. Again, we find good agreement\nwith the data and explicitly demonstrate that a standard boost-invariant expansion does not yield\na satisfactory description. Therefore, initial longitudinal compression and subsequent expansion, an\nessential point of our framework, seems to be realized at SPS conditions.\nThis observation is further strengthened by a calculation of charmonium suppression, which we also find\nto be predominantly sensitive to the initial state. Although uncertainties in the calculation are not small\nand many simplifications have been made, the agreement with data is certainly reassuring.\nIn summary, we have presented a thermal description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the CERN\nSPS for 158 AGeV Pb-Pb which is highly consistent and leads to a good description of a large set of\ndifferent observable quantities. While this does not provide a conclusive proof for the creation of a\nthermalized system (and hence a QGP), it constitutes certainly strong evidence for it. It remains to\nbe investigated if the results can be reproduced in a thermal microscopical transport description (like\nhydrodynamics) and if a non-thermal framework is able to describe the experimental results as well or\nif thermalization is required by the data.\n\n18\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank B.
