We compute the transcendental part of the normal function corresponding to the\nDeligne class of a cycle in K1 of a mirror family of quartic K3 surfaces. The resulting multivalued function does not satisfy the hypergeometric differential equation of the periods and we\nconclude that the cycle is indecomposable for most points in the mirror family. The occuring\ninhomogenous Picard-Fuchs equations are related to Painlev\u00e9 VI type differential equations.\n\n1. The regulator map and Picard-Fuchs equations\nIn this paper we study the first non-classical higher K-group K1 (X) for a smooth complex\nprojective surface X. It was conjectured by H. Esnault around 1995 that certain elements in this\n3 (X, Z(2))\ngroup can be detected in the transcendental part of the Deligne cohomology group HD\nvia the regulator (Chern class) map. The transcendental part of the regulator map is defined as\nan Abel-Jacobi type integral of holomorphic two-forms over non-closed real 2-dimensional chains\nin X associated to these elements. At that time is was only known that one could detect such\nclasses in the complementary (1, 1)-part of Deligne cohomology (see e.g. [16]). The goal of our\npaper is to show that Esnault's conjecture is true by looking at the differential equations which\nare satisfied by the normal functions arising from such classes in a family of surfaces. It turns\nout that the resulting equations for Abel-Jacobi type integrals with parameters are strongly\nconnected to a generalization of Painlev\u00e9 VI type differential equations.\nThe higher K-groups K1 (X), K2 (X), . . . of an algebraic variety X were defined around 1970 by\nD. Quillen [19]. Later Bloch [3] showed that on smooth quasi-projective varieties all their graded\npieces with respect to the \u03b3-filtration may be computed as\ngrp Kn (X)Q \u223c\n= CH p (X, n)Q\n\u03b3\n\nwhere CH p (X, n) are Bloch's higher Chow groups [3]. This isomorphism gives an explicit presentation of higher K-groups modulo torsion via algebraic cycles.\nLet us look more closely at the particular case of K1 (X) for a smooth complex projective surface\nX. There it is known that CH 1 (X, 1) = C\u00d7 and CH p (X, 1) = 0 for p \u2265 4. The remaining\ninteresting parts of K1 are therefore CH 2 (X, 1) and CH 3 (X, 1). The last group consists of zero\ncycles on X \u00d7 P1 in good position and therefore the map\n\u03c4 : CH 2 (X) \u2297Z C\u00d7 \u2192 CH 3 (X, 1),\nCH 3 (X, 1)\n\nx \u2297 a 7\u2192 (x, a)\n\nis surjective. Therefore, the complexity of\nis governed by the complexity of CH 2 (X)\nwhich is fairly understood by Mumford's theorem resp. Bloch's conjecture. We say that\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14C25, 19E20 .\nWe are grateful to DFG, UAM and Univ. Essen for supporting this project.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPEDRO LUIS DEL ANGEL AND STEFAN M\u00dcLLER-STACH\n\nCH 3 (X, 1) is decomposable. For CH 2 (X, 1) the situation is quite different and the complex\ngeometry of X plays an essential role in the understanding of it. The natural map\n\u03c4 : CH 1 (X) \u2297Z C\u00d7 \u2192 CH 2 (X, 1),\n\nD \u2297 a 7\u2192 D \u00d7 {a}\n\nis neither surjective nor injective in general. In the literature there are several examples where\nthe cokernel of \u03c4 is non-trivial modulo torsion and even infinite dimensional, see [4], [12], [16]\nand [24]. The kernel of \u03c4 is related but not equal to Pic0 (X) \u2297 C\u00d7 even modulo torsion by\n[21, thm. 5.2]. Note that the cokernel of \u03c4 is a birational invariant (by localization) and hence\nvanishes for rational surfaces and, in fact, for all surfaces with geometric genus pg (X) = 0 and\nKodaira dimension \u2264 1. The Bloch conjecture would imply that it vanishes also for all surfaces\nof general type which satisfy pg (X) = 0. One way to study CH 2 (X, 1) is to look at the Chern\nclass maps\n(1.1)\n\n3\nc2,1 : CH 2 (X, 1) \u2192 HD\n(X, Z(2)) =\n\nH 2 (X, C)\n.\nH 2 (X, Z) + F 2 H 2 (X, C)\n\nThe decomposable cycles (the image of \u03c4 ) are mapped to the subgroup\nNS(X) \u2297Z C\u00d7 \u2286\n\nH 2 (X, C)\nH 2 (X, Z) + F 2 H 2 (X, C)\n\ngenerated by the N\u00e9ron-Severi group NS(X) \u2282 H 2 (X, Z) of all divisors in X. It is known [16]\nthat the image of c2,1 is at most countable modulo this subgroup, so that the image of coker(\u03c4 )\nin Deligne cohomology modulo NS(X) \u2297Z C\u00d7 is at most countable. One conjectures that even\ncoker(\u03c4 ) itself is countable.\nP\nThe Chern class maps c2,1 are defined as follows: let Z =\naj Zj \u2208 CH 2 (X, 1) be a cycle.\nEach Zj is an integral curve and inherits a rational map fj : Zj \u2192 P1 from the projection\nmap X \u00d7 P1 \u2192 P1 . Let \u03b30 be a path on P1 connecting 0 with \u221e along the real axis, then\n\u03b3 := \u222a\u03b3j := \u222afj\u22121 (\u03b30 ) is a closed homological 1-cycle, Poincar\u00e9 dual to a cohomology class in\nF 2 H 3 (X, Z) and therefore torsion, see [16]. If we assume that \u03b3 = 0 (for example if b1 (X) = 0)\nthen we write \u03b3 = \u2202\u0393 for a real piecewise smooth 2-chain \u0393. The defining property of c2,1 (Z)\nis, as a current, i.e. a linear functional on differentiable complex valued 2-forms on X\nZ\nZ\n1 X\n(1.2)\nlog(fj )\u03b1 + \u03b1.\nc2,1 (\u03b1) =\n2\u03c0i\n\u0393\nZj \u2212\u03b3j\nj\n\nNow let X be a projective K3 surface. Then pg (X) = 1, b2 (X) = 22 and b1 (X) = 0. The\nintersection form on H 2 (X, Z) is known to be the unimodular form 2E8 \u2295 3H, where H is the\n2-dimensional standard hyperbolic form.\nThe N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice N S(X) \u2282 H 2 (X, Z) has an orthogonal complement T (X) \u2282 H 2 (X, Z).\nIn particular there is a well-defined morphism\nT (X) \u2297 C\u00d7\n.\nF2\nIf we have an arbitrary smooth family f : X \u2192 B of complex algebraic surfaces over a quasiprojective complex variety B, and an algebraic family of cycles Zb \u2208 CH 2 (Xb , 1) for all b \u2208 B, then\nwe may define the normal function\nCoker(\u03c4 ) \u2192\n\n\u03bd(b) := c2,1 (Zb ) \u2208\n\nT (Xb ) \u2297 C\u00d7\n.\nF2\n\n\fTHE TRANSCENDENTAL K1 OF A K3 SURFACE\n\n3\n\nOne can easily show that \u03bd is a holomorphic (however multivalued) section of the corresponding\nfamily of generalized tori T (Xb ) \u2297 C\u00d7 /F 2 . Coming back to the case of K3-surfaces: there the\ncanonical bundle \u03c9X is trivial, hence the group H 0,2 (X) = H 0 (X, \u03a92X )\u2217 = C is 1-dimensional and\ngenerated by the dual of \u03c9X . In a smooth algebraic family Xb of K3-surfaces, the composition\nof the regulator with the projection onto\nH 0,2 (Xb )\nImH2 (Xb , Z)\nproduces a multivalued holomorphic function on B, denoted by \u03bd\u0304(b), which has poles at all b\nwhere the family degenerates (proof see below). It is given by the formula\nZ\n\u03c9 Xb ,\n\u03bd\u0304(b) =\n\u0393b\n\nsince the integral of \u03c9X over any effective divisor vanishes. If DPF denotes the Picard-Fuchs\ndifferential operator of the Gauss-Manin connection associated to the family Xb of K3-surfaces,\nthen DPF annihilates all periods of the family. Therefore we obtain the following result:\nLemma 1.1. Let B \u2282 B\u0304 be smooth compactification of B. Then with the notation above,\nDPF (\u03bd\u0304) extends to a single-valued meromorphic function on B\u0304 with poles only along degeneracies\nof Xb , and therefore satisfies a differential equation\n(1.3)\n\nDPF (\u03bd\u0304(b)) = g(b),\n\nwhere g is a rational function in b \u2208 B\u0304.\nThe proof is given in the appendix. Altogether we have obtained a map:\n(1.4)\n\n{Families of Cycles in CH 2 (Xb , 1)} \u2212\u2192 {Differential Equations/Rational Functions}\n\nFor each such family of K3-surfaces it sends a family of cycles to the equation DPF \u03bd\u0304 = g resp.\nthe rational function g, which is the same information on a given family. One should view the\nresulting solutions \u03bd\u0304(b) as new transcendantal functions arising from the family of K-theoretic\ncycles in CH 2 (Xb , 1). If g is a non-trivial function, then \u03bd\u0304 and hence \u03bd is a non-flat section of the\nfamily of Deligne cohomology groups of Xb . In [16] the relationship between the infinitesimal\nbehaviour of such normal functions and the mixed Hodge structure of the total space X was\nalready investigated.\nThis situation is very reminiscent of a method developed by Richard Fuchs [10] in the case of\nthe Legendre family y 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 t) of elliptic curves and investigated further in the work\nof Manin [14, page 134]. In particular there is a strong connection with differential equations of\na generalized form of type Painlev\u00e9 VI (loc. cit.).\nThere exists a formula to derive g: there is a so-called inhomogenous Picard-Fuchs equation\n(1.5)\n\nDPF \u03c9X = drel \u03b2\n\nbefore integration over \u0393, where \u03b2 is a section of the vector bundle of (meromorphic) 1-forms\nin the fibers of the family f : X \u2192 B. We say that \u0393 does not depend on b if it can be defined\nas real semi-algebraic subset via flat coordinates, i.e. coordinate functions which are horizontal\nwith respect to the Gauss-Manin connection, and such that the defining inequalities of \u0393 are\npolynomials not depending on b. This shows on one hand that for closed \u0393 the periods satisfy\n\n\f4\n\nPEDRO LUIS DEL ANGEL AND STEFAN M\u00dcLLER-STACH\n\nthe Picard-Fuchs equation, and on the other hand for non-closed \u0393 (not depending on b) with\n\u2202\u0393 = \u03b3 we get\nZ\nZ\nZ\n(1.6)\ndrel \u03b2 = \u03b2.\ng(b) = DPF \u03c9X =\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\n\u03b3\n\nThe last equality uses a version of Stokes theorem for currents since some of the differential forms\ninvolved will in general have integrable singularities. Hence Stokes theorem for currents (see [11,\nchap. 3]) also implies that \u03b2 is integrable over \u03b3. In general \u0393 depends also on b, and then there\nwill be an additional contribution from the derivatives of the boundaries of the integral. In the\ncase of the Legendre family y 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 t) of elliptic curves, \u03b2 is a meromorphic function\n(0-form)\ny\n,\n2(x \u2212 t)2\nby [10, p. 310],[14, p. 76]. Manin has put these equations into a more formal context (so-called\n\u03bc-equations) so that one can understand the sections and operators in a coordinate-free way\nin terms of certain locally free sheaves on B. This plays also a role in his work on the functional Mordell conjecture. Furthermore, after uniformizing the elliptic curves, the inhomogenous\nPicard-Fuchs equation is equivalent to a version involving the Weierstrass p-function [14, p. 137]:\n3\nTj\n1 X\nd2 z\n\u03b1j pz (z + , \u03c4 ),\n=\n2\n2\nd\u03c4\n(2\u03c0i)\n2\nj=0\n\nwhere \u03b1j are constants parametrizing the family of differential equations and (T0 , . . . , T3 ) =\n(0, 1, \u03c4, 1 + \u03c4 ) are the vertices of the fundamental parallelogram. In this way the transcendental\naspect of the solutions and also the connection to integrable systems becomes apparent, see\n[14, p. 139]. In the future we hope to investigate further the transcendental properties of our\nsolutions (using again uniformization) and study the attached integrable systems.\nThe rest of this article is devoted to a particular solution of the inhomogenous Picard-Fuchs\nequation for a certain family of K3 surfaces introduced in section 2. In section 3 we\n\u221a deduce\nEsnault's conjecture from the non-vanishing of the DPF (\u03bd\u0304) in the special case b = \u22121. In\nsection 4 we study a certain Shioda-Inose model of Xb which has isomorphic transcendental\ncohomology. This leads to an explicit computation of \u03b2 in this case.\n2. An example: a mirror family of K3-surfaces\nWe will study the one-dimensional family of K3-surfaces given by the quartic equations\n(2.1)\n\nXb := {(x, y, z, w) \u2208 P3 | f (x, y, z, w) = xyz(x + y + z + bw) + w4 = 0}.\n\nwith b \u2208 P1 . Note that this surface, for general b, is not smooth but has six singular points\ndefining a rational singularity of type A3 . The six points are ([17, sect.4]):\nP1 =(0, 1, \u22121, 0),\n\nP3 =(1, 0, \u22121, 0),\n\nP5 =(0, 1, 0, 0),\n\nP2 =(1, \u22121, 0, 0)\n\nP4 =(1, 0, 0, 0)\nP6 =(0, 0, 1, 0)\n\nThe minimal resolution of the singularities defines a generically smooth family of K3-surfaces.\nIn [17] the following theorem was shown:\n\n\fTHE TRANSCENDENTAL K1 OF A K3 SURFACE\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2.1. (Narumiya/Shiga) The family Xb has the following properties:\n1. It arises as a mirror family from the dual of the simplest polytope P of dimension three.\nThe dual mirror family is the family of all quartic K3-surfaces.\n2. The rank of Pic(X) is \u2265 19 for all b \u2208 P1 \\ {0, \u00b14, \u221e} and equal to 19 for very general b\n(see loc.cit. \u00a74.).\n3.

We refer to [17] for more details, but we sketch the proof of (4) and (5) since this is\ncrucial. (1)-(3) follow from the construction. In particular six A3 -singularities give rise to 18\nindependent cohomology classes of type (1,1) so that the Picard number is \u2265 19. Since (5) is an\neasy corollary of (4), we prove (4). In [17] the periods are computed as power series in 1/b and\nthe differential equation in (4) follows from [22]. As in [17] we consider the new affine equation\nf (x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z + 1) + 1/b4 = 0\nobtained by substituting w\u2032 := bw and setting w\u2032 = 1. The periods are integrals of the form\nZ\ndxdydz\n1\n.\nI(b) =\n2\u03c0i |x|=|y|=|z|=1/4 xyz(x + y + z + 1) + 1/b4\nOn the other hand one has a geometric series expansion at b = \u221e:\n\u221e\n\nX\n(\u22121)n b\u22124n\n1\n=\n.\n4\nn+1\nn+1\nxyz(x + y + z + 1) + 1/b\n(xyz)\n(x\n+\ny\n+\nz\n+\n1)\nn=0\n\nChanging the order of summation and integration, we obtain\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1\n(\u22121)n b\u22124n dxdydz\nI(b) =\n2\u03c0i |x|=|y|=|z|=1/4\n(xyz)n+1 (x + y + z + 1)n+1\nn=0\n\u221e Z\n(\u22121)n b\u22124n dxdydz\n1 X\n=\n2\u03c0i n=0 |x|=|y|=|z|=1/4 (xyz)n+1 (x + y + z + 1)n+1\n\n\f6\n\nPEDRO LUIS DEL ANGEL AND STEFAN M\u00dcLLER-STACH\n\nNow one can apply 3 times the residue theorem and gets\n2\n\nI(b) = (2\u03c0i)\n\n\u221e\nX\n(4n)!\n\nn=0\n\n(n!)4\n\nb\u22124n .\n\nObserving the identity involving Pochhammer symbols\n( 41 )n ( 24 )n ( 43 )n 4 n\n(4n)!\n=\n(4 ) ,\n(n!)4\n(1)n (1)n (1)n\nwe have shown that\n1 2 3\n4\nI(b) = (2\u03c0i)2 F3,2 ( , , , 1, 1; ( )4 )\n4 4 4\nb\n4 4\nSubstituting u := ( b ) , one gets a multiple of the functions F3,2 ( 14 , 42 , 34 , 1, 1; u) which satisfy a\ndifferential equation of order three precisely of the type described in (4) resp.

Use chain rule.\nTo make the following computations easier, we follow [17] and perform the following birational\ncoordinate change (written in affine coordinates):\nbxy 1 + xyz\n+\n), Z = yz.\n2\nz\nThen X, Y, Z are affine coordinates and define the family of surfaces Sb in Weierstrassform:\nX = xy,\n\nY = i(\n\nY 2 = X(X 2 + X(Z +\n\nSb :\n\n1\nb2\n\u2212 ) + 1)\nZ\n4\n\nas an elliptic fibration over P1 in the Z-coordinate.

The following is taken from [17] (with a slight correction):\nLemma 2.3. The surfaces Sb are ramified coverings of P1 \u00d7P1 (in X, Z coordinates). In X, Y, Z\ncoordinates, the canonical holomorphic two form on Sb is given up to an non-zero constant by\n(2.4)\n\n\u03c9=\n\ndXdY\ndXdZ\n= 2\n,\nYZ\nX (Z \u2212 Z1 )\n\nwhere X, Z are flat coordinates and\nY = Y (b) =\n\np\n\nP (X, Z) =\n\nr\n\nX(X 2 + X(Z +\n\n1\nb2\n\u2212 ) + 1).\nZ\n4\n\n\fTHE TRANSCENDENTAL K1 OF A K3 SURFACE\n\n7\n\nProof. In the x, y, z coordinate system the holomorphic two form is given up to a constant by\ndxdy\nfz in affine (x, y, z)-coordinates with w = 1. Then, using the coordinate transformations\nabove, one computes that\n\u221a\ndXdY\ndxdy\ndXdZ\n= 2\n\u03c9 = \u22121 *\n1 = YZ ,\nfz\nX (Z \u2212 Z )\n\u2202P\nsince 2Y dY = X 2 (1 \u2212 Z12 )dZ + \u2202X\ndX.\nNow, if we apply the Picard-Fuchs-Operator DPF from Cor.2.2 to\nthe form\ndXdZ\ndXdZ\n= K(X, Z) * 7\nDPF\nYZ\nY Z\nwhere K(X, Z) is a polynomial function in X, Z.\n\ndXdZ\nYZ ,\n\nwe get an expression of\n\n3. The normal function and the Picard-Fuchs equation\nOn any elliptic surface, the easiest way to find cycles in K1 is to use fibers. However sometimes\nconfigurations coming from N\u00e9ron fibers (degenerate into a union of P1 's) do have trivial class\nin K1 as was already observed by Beilinson in [1]. But one can use one smooth fiber together\nwith a bunch of sections (rational) and rational curves in degenerate fibers. In our example let\nus take the following cycles: denote by Sb the surface defined by the equation\nb2\n)X + Z)\n4\nLet Cb be the smooth elliptic fibre over Z = 1 of this surface. Its defining equation is hence\n(3.1)\n\nSb :\n\nZY 2 = X(X 2 Z + (Z 2 + 1 \u2212 Z\n\nCb :\n\nY 2 = X(X 2 + (2 \u2212\n\nb2\n)X + 1)\n4\n\n2\n\nThe quadratic term X 2 + (2 \u2212 b4 )X + 1 in the right hand side has two negative real roots if b is\n\u221a\npurely imaginary, for example b = \u22121. The points X = 0 and X = \u221e are rationally equivalent\non Cb after taking a multiple of two, since they are ramification points. The real line from 0 to \u221e\ndoes not hit the other ramification points by this observation. The surface Xb in this birational\nmodel has 0 and X = \u221e as sections. The fiber over Z = 0 on Sb decomposes into three rational\ncurves with multiplicity counted. Hence one can construct a cycle in CH 2 (Sb , 1) for general b\nby using Cb , the two sections and the degenerate fibers and appropriate rational functions on\nall curves.\n\u221a In X, Z coordinates the region \u0393 is given by the real square 0 \u2264 Z \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 X \u2264 \u221e.\nFor b = \u22121 we make the following observation:\n\u221a\ndXdZ\nLemma 3.1. For b = \u22121 all coefficients occuring in DPF dXdZ\nY Z = K(X, Z) * Y 7 Z are positive\n2\nintegers, i.e. all coefficients of K(X, Z) and all coefficients of Y 2 = X(X 2 + X(Z + Z1 \u2212 b4 ) + 1).\n\u2202Z\n\u2202Y\nb 1\nProof. Here the rules of differentiating are \u2202X\n\u2202b = \u2202b = 0 and \u2202b = 4 Y 3 . This implies that\nodd derivatives of 1/Y get multiplied by even powers of b. Now if we look at the coefficients of\nequation (2.3), we see that the coefficients at \u03a8\u2032\u2032\u2032 and \u03a8\u2032 become positive, since ( 4b )4 \u2212 1 and\n( 4b )4 \u2212 6 are negative rational numbers and get multiplied with ( 4b )6 , resp. ( 4b )2 which are both\nalso negative rational numbers. The coefficients at \u03a8 and \u03a8\u2032\u2032 involve already 4-th powers of\n\n\f8\n\nPEDRO LUIS DEL ANGEL AND STEFAN M\u00dcLLER-STACH\n\nb and hence positive. Consequently all coefficients occuring are positive. Using any computer\nalgebra program this can be verified and indeed one has:\ndXdZ dXdZ\n=\n(349951 X 3 Z 3 + 85952 X Z 3 + 85952 X 5 Z 3 + 171904 X 4 Z 4 + 171904 X 4 Z 2\nDPF\nYZ\n8192\n+ 85952 X 3 Z 5 + 171904 X 2 Z 4 + 294912 X 2 Z + 294912 X Z 2 + 98304 Z 3\n+ 98304 X 3 + 294912 X 4 Z + 909352 X 2 Z 3 + 909352 X 3 Z 2 + 98304 X 6 Z 3\n+ 294912 X 5 Z 4 + 294912 X 5 Z 2 + 909352 X 4 Z 3 + 294912 X 4 Z 5 + 909352 X 3 Z 4\n+ 294912 X Z 4 + 98304 X 3 Z 6 + 294912 X 2 Z 5 + 85952 X 3 Z + 171904 X 2 Z 2 )/\n\u221a\n(4 X 2 Z + 4 X Z 2 + 4 X + X Z + 4 Z)7/2 XZ\nThis completes the proof.\nIn particular, if we integrate over the positive region \u0393, we get a positive and non-zero integral. Since the boundary of \u0393 is defined as the rectangle 0 \u2264 Z \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 X \u2264 \u221e and X, Z are\nflat with respect to the connection, we say that \u0393 does not depend on b (see introduction) and\nthis suffices to show that the normal function is non-trivial. So we have proved the Esnault's\nconjecture (see [16]):\nCorollary 3.2. The projected normal function \u03bd\u0304(b) does not satisfy the Picard-Fuchs equation\nb\n3 b\nb\n1 b b 4\n3\nb\n(3.2)\n(( ) \u2212 6)\u03a6\u2032 + \u03a6 = 0\n(( )4 \u2212 1)( )3 \u03a6\u2032\u2032\u2032 + ( )2 (1 + ( )4 )\u03a6\u2032\u2032 +\n4\n4\n4 4\n4\n16 4 4\n32\nIn particular, it is not a rational multiple of a period for all but a countable number of values\nb. For those b, the corresponding cycle Zb has no integer multiple which is decomposable modulo\nP ic(Xb ) \u2297 C\u2217 .\n\nThe main open problem remains to find 1-form \u03b2 such that d\u03b2 = DPF dXdZ\nY Z . We will compute\nsuch a \u03b2 for the Kummer type model of these K3 surfaces in the next section.\n4. The solution of D\u03c9 = d\u03b2\n\nIn [17] you can find the description of a 2:1 map \u03c0 : Sb \u2192 Sb\u2032 onto a Kummer surface Sb\u2032 which\nhas a birational model with the equation\n\u03bd+1 2\n(4.1)\nu2 = s(s \u2212 1)(s \u2212 (\n) )t(t \u2212 1)(t \u2212 \u03bd 2 ),\n\u03bd\u22121\nwhere \u03bd and b are related via the algebraic equation\n(\u03bd 2 + 1)2\n.\n\u03bd(\u03bd 2 \u2212 1)\nWe prefer to use this equation for a computation of the solution of D\u03c9 = d\u03b2, since it is slightly\neasier but we do not loose essential information. In this description we see that the transcendental part of H 2 (Sb ) also denoted by T (Sb ) has a Inose-Shioda structure (in the sense of [15]) and\nis therefore related to a variation of a family of elliptic curves. In fact there are two isogenous\nelliptic curves E1 (\u03bd) and E2 (\u03bd) with equations\n\u03bd+1 2\n(4.2)\n) )\nE1 (\u03bd) : u21 = s(s \u2212 1)(s \u2212 \u03bd 2 ), E2 (\u03bd) : u22 = t(t \u2212 1)(t \u2212 (\n\u03bd\u22121\nb2 = \u22124 *\n\n\fTHE TRANSCENDENTAL K1 OF A K3 SURFACE\n\n9\n\ntogether with a Nikulin involution (see [23]) on the abelian surface A = E1 \u00d7 E2 such that the\nassociated Kummer surface is Sb\u2032 and one has an isomorphism T (Sb ) \u223c\n= T (Sb\u2032 ) under \u03c0\u2217 . This\nexplains in addition why the periods of Sb are squares of other hypergeometric functions related\nto the family E1 (\u03bd) resp. E2 (\u03bd). More details about the birational map can be found in [17].\nFurther instances where Inose-Shioda structures and modular forms come up can be found in\n[8].

Now first note that\nd\nd\u03b2s\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (s) = As \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 (s) + (A\u2032s + Bs )\u03c9 \u2032 (s) + Bs\u2032 \u03c9(s) +\nd\u03bd\nand furthermore\nd\nd\u03b2s = d\u03b2s\u2032 ,\nd\u03bd\nby symmetry of mixed derivatives. A similar relation holds for t. By using the product formulas\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u03c9 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9(t) + 3\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032 (t) + 3\u03c9 \u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 (t) + \u03c9(s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (t),\nwe obtain that\n\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9(t) + 2\u03c9 \u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032 (t) + \u03c9(s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 (t),\n\n3\n1\n3\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 (As + At )\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = [A\u2032s + Bs + 3Bt \u2212 A2s \u2212 As At ]\u03c9 \u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9(t)\n2\n2\n2\n1\n3\n3\n+[A\u2032t + Bt + 3Bs \u2212 A2t \u2212 As At ]\u03c9(s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032 (t) + [As Bs + At Bt \u2212 (Bs + Bt )(As + At ) + Bs\u2032 + Bt\u2032 ]\u03c9\n2\n2\n2\n\n\fTHE TRANSCENDENTAL K1 OF A K3 SURFACE\n\n11\n\n1\n3\n1\n3\n+drel [(\u03b2s\u2032 \u2212 ( As + At )\u03b2s )\u03c9(t) + 3\u03b2s \u03c9 \u2032 (t) \u2212 (\u03b2t\u2032 \u2212 ( At + As )\u03b2t )\u03c9(s) \u2212 3\u03b2t \u03c9 \u2032 (s)]\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndoes not involve anymore terms of the form \u03c9 \u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032 (t).

Appendix\nIn this section we give the proof of the following lemma from the introduction:\nLemma 1.1: In the situation of the introduction, DPF (\u03bd\u0304) is a single-valued meromorphic\nfunction on B with poles only along degeneracies of Xb , and therefore satisfies a differential\nequation\nDPF (\u03bd\u0304) = g,\nwhere g is a rational function in b \u2208 B.\nProof. Assume that we have a family f : X\u0304 \u2192 B\u0304 of projective surfaces over a compact Riemann\nsurface B\u0304. Let \u03a3 \u2286 B\u0304 be the finite subset over which there are singular fibers. Let h : X \u2192 B\nbe the smooth part of f . We may assume that the family is semi-stable (semi-stable reduction)\nand that there is a cycle Z \u2208 CH 2 (X, 1) such that the restriction of Z to all fibers induces\nthe family of cycles in CH 2 (Xb , 1) (both reductions require perhaps a finite cover of B which\n3 (X, Z(2)) in\ndoes not however change the assertion). The cycle Z has a class c3,2 (Z) \u2208 HD\n\u22121\nDeligne cohomology. By semi-stability \u2206 := f \u03a3 is a divisor with strict normal crossings and\nits Deligne cohomology can be computed via the logarithmic de Rham complex. Let V 2 be\nthe sheaf of transcendental cohomology classes in R2 h\u2217 C, a local system of rank 22 \u2212 \u03c1(Xb )\nfor b general. The Deligne class vanishes in F 3 \u2229 H 3 (Xb , Z), since b3 (Xb ) = 0 in our case, and\ntherefore induces a holomorphic normal function \u03bd \u2208 H 0 (B, V 2 \u2297 OB /F 2 ) over B. However\n\n\f12\n\nPEDRO LUIS DEL ANGEL AND STEFAN M\u00dcLLER-STACH\n\nsince the family is semi-stable, there is a canonical extension of \u03bd to a holomorphic section of\nthe sheaf R2 f\u2217 \u03a9\u2217X\u0304/B\u0304 (log\u2206). This can be seen as follows: let\nZD,X (2) = Cone(Rj\u2217 Z(2) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217X\u0304 (log\u2206)/F 2 )[\u22121]\nj\n\nbe the Beilinson-Deligne complex [9] of X using the inclusion X \u0592\u2192X\u0304 and\nZD,h(2) = Cone(Rj\u2217 Z(2) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217X\u0304/B\u0304 (log\u2206)/F 2 )[\u22121]\nthe relative Beilinson-Deligne complex of h. There is a natural surjection of complexes ZD,X (2) \u2192\n3 (X, Z(2)) \u2192 H 0 (B\u0304, R3 f Z\nZD,h (2) which induces a morphism HD\n\u2217 D,f (2)). Since all fibers of h\nsatisfy b3 (Xb ) = 0, we conclude that the image of this element in H 0 (B\u0304, R3 f\u2217 Rj\u2217 Z(2)) vanishes. Therefore the image of c3,2 (Z) in H 0 (B\u0304, R3 f\u2217 ZD,f (2)) is coming (at least locally because of monodromy) from a class in H 0 (B\u0304, R2 f\u2217 \u03a9\u2217X\u0304/B\u0304 (log\u2206)/F 2 ) and is thus an extension of\n\u03bd \u2208 H 0 (B, R2 f\u2217 \u03a9\u2217X/B /F 2 ) to B\u0304. By construction it is meromorphic along \u03a3 but still multivalued with indeterminacies in the local system of integral cohomology classes. Now we apply\nthe Picard-Fuchs operator. This makes g(b) a single-valued complex function on B. DPF has\nmeromorphic (rational) coefficients in b, since they are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Gauss-Manin connection, which has regular singular points along \u03a3 by Deligne [6].\nTherefore the resulting function g(b) is holomorphic outside \u03a3, but can have higher order poles\nalong \u03a3. By Chow's theorem any meromorphic function on B\u0304 is rational.\n\nAcknowledgement: We are grateful to S. Bloch, H. Esnault, Y. Manin and J.
