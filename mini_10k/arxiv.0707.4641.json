Palla & Stahler (1999, 2000)\nhave used ages estimated from the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams of several clusters to argue that star formation\ntakes place over more than 10 Myr and at an accelerating\nrate towards the present day. Huff & Stahler (2006) show\nthat this formation history appears to be similar in the inner and outer parts of the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC),\nsuggesting that the acceleration was triggered by a global\ncontraction of the parent cloud. However, these conclusions\nare not universally accepted. Hartmann (2001) has shown\nthat errors in determining the luminosities of young stars,\ndue to binarism, uncertain extinction, variability and accrec 2007 RAS\n\ntion can lead to significant overestimates of the age spread\nin an H-R diagram and obscure the detailed star formation\nhistory.\nIn this paper I explore an alternative technique for estimating the extent of luminosity and (inferred) age spreads in\nstar forming regions using pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in\nthe ONC as an example. Rotational periods and projected\nequatorial velocities can be combined to give a geometric\nestimate of the stellar radius multiplied by the sine of an\nunknown rotation axis inclination, R sin i. Assuming random axial orientations and using PMS evolutionary models,\nthe distributions of R sin i can be modelled in terms of a\ndispersion in true radius and inferred age. This idea was\nstimulated by the work of Rhode, Herbst & Mathieu (2001),\nwho calculated mean R sin i as a function of position in the\nH-R diagram, finding 3-sigma evidence that stars with lower\nluminosities did indeed have smaller radii. Here I provide a\nmore sophisticated analysis of a larger dataset. This work\nfollows closely on from the related analysis presented in Jeffries (2007), where a similar approach was used to provide\na revised distance estimate for the ONC.\nThe data base of rotational measurements used in this\n\n\f2\n\nR.D.

The results are presented in\nsection 4 and discussed in section 5.\n\n2\n\nTHE OBSERVATIONAL DATABASE\n\nThe ONC is among the best studied star forming regions\nand the premier cluster for investigating star formation and\nearly stellar evolution. It is relatively nearby, very young\n(392 \u00b1 34 pc, \u22431\u20132 Myr \u2013 Jeffries 2007; 389+24\n\u221221 pc \u2013 Sandstrom et al. 2007) and contains a large population of stars\nand brown dwarfs covering the entire (sub)stellar mass spectrum (0.01 < M/M\u2299 < 30 \u2013 see Hillenbrand 1997; Slesnick,\nHillenbrand & Carpenter 2004).\nJeffries (2007) assembled a database of 95 K- and Mtype PMS stars in the ONC, with model-dependent masses\nof about 0.2\u20132 M\u2299 and which have proper-motion or radial\nvelocity membership credentials, spectral types and luminosities (Hillenbrand 1997), effective temperatures based on\nthe work by Cohen & Kuhi (1979), indicators of whether\nobjects were actively accreting (based on I \u2212 K excess,\nfrom Hillenbrand [1997]), rotation periods (Herbst et al.\n2002) and v sin i (measured by Rhode et al. [2001] or SiciliaAguilar et al. [2005]). The typical precision of the measurements are \u00b11 spectral subclass, \u00b1150 K in effective temperature, < 1% uncertainty in the periods and \u2243 10% uncertainties in v sin i. The smallest v sin i values that are taken\nto be reliably measured are 13.6 km s\u22121 and 10.0 km s\u22121 for\nthe Rhode et al. and Sicilia-Aguilar et al. measurements respectively.\nThere are various filters applied to this data and a number of possible selection effects. The most important of these\nwith regard to possible radius or age spreads are: (i) a bias\nagainst the inclusion of classical T-Tauri stars (CTTS), be-\n\ncause their rotation periods can be difficult to distinguish\nfrom other non-periodic variability; (ii) a bias against slowly\nrotating stars, either because their periods are too long to\nreliably detect, they are not so magnetically active or their\nv sin i is too small to be reliably measured; and (iii) the sample of stars which are bright enough to obtain spectroscopy\nis biased towards optically brighter and hence intrinsically\nmore luminous (and probably younger) stars.\nIf CTTS are predominantly younger than non-accreting\nweak-lined T-Tauri stars (WTTS) then the first effect will\nbias the sample towards older ages. The second effect is more\ncomplicated. As PMS stars contract they spin-up, but they\nmay also lose angular momentum through winds or star-disc\ninteractions as they get older. The longer period stars that\nremain in our sample appear to have larger radii on average (from radii estimated by Hillenbrand 1997) and may be\nyounger. On the other hand, at a given rotation period a\nsmaller (older) star will have a lower v sin i. Therefore these\nselection effects probably bias our sample against the inclusion of some of the youngest and oldest stars. Finally,\nany bias against low-luminosity stars will potentially exclude older stars, especially in the lowest mass objects in\nour sample. The discussion of completeness in Hillenbrand\n(1997) suggests that any incompleteness in the stars with\nspectroscopy will arise from the requirements of obtaining\nv sin i using high resolution spectroscopy, which is restricted\nto brighter stars. Spectral types can be obtained using low\nresolution spectroscopy for much fainter objects.\nAn illustration of these potential effects is provided by\ncomparing the H-R diagrams for our \"rotation sample\" and\nfor proper-motion selected ONC members with temperatures and luminosities from Hillenbrand (1997). The H-R\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 1, along with isochrones from\nD'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997). The luminosities from Hillenbrand (1997) have been adjusted to correspond to the\n392 pc found by Jeffries (2007), rather than the 470 pc assumed by Hillenbrand (1997).\nModel-dependent PMS stellar ages are estimated from\nthese isochrones. Histograms of age are shown in Fig. 2 for\nthe rotation sample and the full ONC sample, using linear and logarithmic age bins. The median ages are 0.62 Myr\nand 1.03 Myr for the rotation sample and the full sample respectively. The linearly binned age distribution of\nthe Hillenbrand (1997) sample in Fig. 2 shows the pseudoexponential decline characterised as \"accelerating star formation\" by Palla & Stahler (1999). This translates into a\npeak in the number of stars per logarithmic age interval\nat around 1 Myr. Fig. 2 also demonstrates that the tail of\n\"older\" (> 3 Myr) stars appears to be absent from the rotation sample. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test suggests\nthat there is a < 1 per cent probability that the two age distributions are consistent. This selection effect arises chiefly\nfrom the bias towards brighter targets. Some of the age bias\nmight be thought to arise because older, smaller objects\ncould have unresolveable v sin i (see Rebull, Wolff & Strom\n2004). However, the H-R diagram-based age distribution for\nobjects which have unresolved v sin i but otherwise match\nthe sample selection criteria is in fact similar to that of the\nrotation sample.\nStars in the rotation sample are classified as CTTS or\nWTTS on the basis of whether their I \u2212 K colour excess is\ngreater or less than 0.3 mag (see Hillenbrand et al. 1998).

I have repeated these exercises using the Siess, Dufour & Forestini (2000) models (the Z = 0.02 variety) and\nthese are shown in Fig. 3. The Siess et al. models give older\nages and the evidence for \"accelerating\" star formation up\nto the present day now disappears to be replaced by a peak\nin the star formation rate in the recent past. However, the\nconclusions regarding a bias in the rotation sample and the\nmissing tail of older stars remain. The median ages using\nthe Siess et al. (2000) models are 1.55 Myr and 2.51 Myr for\nthe rotation sample and full samples respectively.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nMonte Carlo Models\n\nThe background to the method used in this paper is described by Jeffries (2007). The projected equatorial radius\nof a PMS star can be estimated from\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n(R sin i)obs =\n\nk\nPobs (v sin i)obs\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i is the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of\nsight, Pobs is the observed period, (v sin i)obs is the observed\nprojected equatorial velocity and k a constant dependent on\nthe system of units in use. For any group of stars a mean\nR sin i could be found and divided by an average projection\nfactor to obtain an estimate of the true radius. This was\nthe approach adopted by Rhode et al. (2001), but is subject\nto a number of problems. First, many objects are not included in the considered samples because their v sin i values\nare too small to be resolved or their periods could not be\nmeasured because sin i was too small. Second, uncertainties\nin the measured P and v sin i values themselves mean that\nthe underlying distribution of projection factors is modified\nfrom a pure sinusoidal form. The aim here is to model the\ndistribution of (R sin i)obs using a Monte Carlo simulation,\nstarting from an assumed distribution of Rtrue , the assumption of random axial inclination and taking account of the\nselection effects and measurement errors.\nIf we accept that Pobs is related to Ptrue , the true rotation period in the absence of measurement uncertainties,\n\n\f4\n\nR.D. Jeffries\n\naccording to a normal error distribution characterised by a\nfractional measurement uncertainty \u03b4P , then\nPobs = Ptrue (1 + \u03b4P U ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U is a random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean of zero and unit standard deviation. The\nprecision of the periods is generally very good and we assume \u03b4P = 0.01 in all cases. Similarly, there is a relationship\nbetween the true and observed projected equatorial velocity\n(v sin i)obs = vtrue sin i (1 + \u03b4v U ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4v is the fractional observational uncertainty in\n(v sin i)obs (taken from the papers where the measurement\nwas presented). In this case vtrue and sin i are split into separate factors in order to properly model the observational\nlower limits to v sin i and any selection effect on the possible\nvalues of i (see below).\nEquations 1\u20133 can be combined to give\n(R sin i)obs = Rtrue (1 + \u03b4P U1 ) (1 + \u03b4v U2 ) sin i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere sin i can be generated assuming random axial orientation and U1 and U2 are different random numbers taken\nfrom a unit Gaussian distribution. Note that in this formulation (R sin i)obs is independent of the assumed Ptrue or vtrue\nvalues, but that this is not the case once selection effects are\nconsidered (see below).\nFor a given observational sample, 104 randomised values of (R sin i)obs are generated for each star. The initial\nRtrue distribution is taken from model isochrones at the Teff\ncorresponding to each star in the observed sample. As a\nfurther refinement Rtrue can be drawn randomly from a distribution, either in terms of a spread about the isochronal\nradius, or specified as a distribution of age (see section 3.2).\nThere are some further complications which are dealt\nwith in the model. First, because the isochrones have a significant slope in the H-R diagram, then an uncertainty in Teff\nleads to additional dispersion in the expected Rtrue . This is\naccounted for with a \u00b1150 K Gaussian perturbation in Teff\nwhen Rtrue is calculated from the evolutionary models.\nSecond, the observational sample will be incomplete for\nobjects which have a low inclination angle because starspot\nmodulation may be difficult to observe in these stars (see Jeffries 2007 for a discussion). This is dealt with by adopting\na threshold inclination angle ith , below which randomised\ntrials will be rejected from the model distribution. This free\nparameter principally affects the low end of the R sin i distribution. It is assumed that ith is independent of rotation\nperiod.\nThere is also the issue of limits imposed by spectral resolution on the values of (v sin i)obs that can be recorded. This\nis dealt with by discarding randomised trials which have a\nv sin i lower than the threshold appropriate for the dataset\nin question. The minimum measurable value of (v sin i)obs\nis well defined, but the rejection process requires that an\ninitial vtrue distribution is also specified. Here I follow the\nexample in Jeffries (2007) and hypothesise a simple vtrue\ndistribution, which after multiplying by the projection factor and accounting for observational uncertainties, provides\na good match (measured with a K-S test) to the observed\nv sin i distribution. The exact choice of vtrue distribution has\nvery little effect on the simulated R sin i distributions (see\nalso Jeffries 2007).\n\n3.2\n\nAge distributions\n\nA number of possible radius or age distributions can be\ntested to see whether they provide a reasonable description\nof any particular sample. The scenarios investigated are: (1)\na co-eval population; (2) a Gaussian distribution of log10 R\naround an isochronal locus; (3) a radius calculated according\nto a Gaussian distribution in log10 age; (4) a radius calculated from an age distribution which exponentially decays\nbeyond an initial starting age; and (5) a radius calculated\naccording to the age distributions inferred from the traditional H-R diagram (see Figs. 2 and 3).\nBecause Rtrue is expected to vary with Teff at a given\nage then the distributions of Rtrue should be specified as\na function of Teff . This problem is finessed by normalising\nRtrue by its value at an age of 3 Myr and at the Teff of a\ngiven star (for the observations) or trial (for the models).\nThis effectively collapses the two-dimensional distribution\nalong the isochrones, reducing the observed distribution to\none-dimensional form and will be termed the distribution of\nnormalised projected radii, R sin i/R3Myr .\nThe results from scenarios 1 and 2 will be largely independent of the choice of evolutionary model as they rely\nonly on normalising the Rtrue values with an appropriate\nisochrone of R vs Teff . However, the absolute ages and age\nspreads in scenarios 3\u20135 could be very dependent on choice\nof evolutionary model. With this in mind the evolutionary\nmodels of D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997 \u2013 hereafter DAM97)\nand the solar metallicity models of Siess, Dufour & Forestini\n(2000, hereafter S00) have both been tested.\nThere are too many free parameters and too few data\npoints in the binned distribution of (R sin i)obs (see section 4) to attempt an inversion to a true radius distribution\nor to perform chi-squared fitting \u2013 although this may be\npossible in future with more numerous data points. Instead,\nK-S tests are used to determine whether a model is capable\nof providing a satisfactory description of the observed (cumulative) (R sin i)obs /R3Myr distribution and to show which\nmodels can be ruled out by the data. In each scenario the\nparameter which determines the mean R sin i/R3Myr value,\ni.e. the central isochronal age, has been adjusted to minimise the K-S statistic and maximise consistency between\ndata and model.\nThe main goals are to answer the following questions:\n\n(i) Is the normalised R sin i distribution of the ONC rotation sample consistent with a coeval sample that has no\ndispersion in radius about an isochronal value?\n(ii) If not, then what is the spread in radius about an\nisochronal value that could best explain the observed normalised R sin i distribution?\n(iii) If the dispersion in radius is modelled as an age distribution then what is the age spread implied by the data\nand is any particular form of the age spread (Gaussian, exponential) preferred?\n(iv) Is the distribution of normalised R sin i consistent\nwith the age distribution inferred from the positions of the\nsame stars in the H-R diagram?\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fAge spreads in the ONC\n6\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n3\n\nWTTS \u2206(I-K)<0.3\nCTTS \u2206(I-K)>0.3\nUnknown\n\nSiess et al. models\n\n5\n\nR (sin i)obs/R3 Myr\n\nR (sin i)obs/R3 Myr\n\n5\n\n4\n\n6\n\nWTTS \u2206(I-K)<0.3\nCTTS \u2206(I-K)>0.3\nUnknown\n\nD'Antona Mazzitelli models\n\n5\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\n4\n0.3\n3\n\n1.0\n\n2\n\n1.0\n1\n\n3.0\n\n1\n\n10\n30\n0\n5500\n\n3.0\n10\n30\n\n5000\n\n4500\n\n4000\n\n3500\n\nTeff (K)\n\n3000\n\n0\n5500\n\n5000\n\n4500\n\n4000\n\n3500\n\n3000\n\nTeff (K)\n\nFigure 4. Normalised (R sin i)obs versus Teff for the rotation sample. (R sin i)obs was calculated using equation 1 and then divided by\nthe isochronal value of R at 3 Myr. The two panels show the results of these calculations using the evolutionary models of DAM97 (left)\nand S00 (right). CTTS and WTTS (classified according to their near-IR excesses) are given different symbols. In each panel the solid\nlines indicate isochrones of normalised radius at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 and 30 Myr.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nThe projected stellar radii\n\nFigure 4 shows the normalised projected radii for the rotation sample as a function of Teff . Both the DAM97 and\nS00 models have been used to normalise the (R sin i)obs values calculated from equation 1 and the results are shown\nin the left and right hand panels respectively, compared\nto isochrones of normalised radius from the same models. In neither case is there any evidence for a trend in\n(R sin i)obs /R3Myr with Teff (a least squares fit gives a\nflat line within 1-sigma uncertainty in both instances),\nwhich supports the approach of using the distribution\nof (R sin i)obs /R3Myr as a Teff -independent indicator of\nthe true spread in radii (or age). The mean values of\n(R sin i)obs /R3Myr are 1.51 \u00b1 0.08 and 1.24 \u00b1 0.07 for the\nDAM97 and S00 models respectively. Hence the mean age\nof the ONC (as judged by the stellar radii) is significantly\nyounger according to the DAM97 models than according\nto the S00 models, but in both cases is < 3 Myr because\n(R sin i)obs should be a lower limit to Rtrue .\n4.2\n\nA coeval population\n\nThe first distribution of Rtrue tested was that of a coeval\npopulation. The age was specified and then the cumulative\ndistribution of (R sin i)obs /R3Myr tested against the MonteCarlo predictions. The assumed age was adjusted to minimise the K-S statistic and select the model Rtrue distribution least different to the observational data. This process\nwas repeated using both the S00 and DAM97 evolutionary\nmodels to calculate R3Myr . The numerical results are listed\nin Table 1 and illustrated in Fig 5 (the coeval models are\nthe rows with a dispersion in radius [see section 4.3], set to\n\u03c3r = 0). Initially I used Gaussian Teff uncertainties of 150 K\nand a threshold inclination ith = 30\u25e6 . The assumed vtrue distribution consists of 20 per cent of stars following a uniform\ndistribution for 10 < vtrue < 120 km s\u22121 with the remaining\n80 per cent following an exponential distribution with a decay constant of 12 km s\u22121 between 10 < vtrue < 120 km s\u22121 .\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\nAdopting this, the observed v sin i distribution is well reproduced by the model with a K-S rejection probability of < 10\nper cent (see Jeffries 2007).\nFor both the DAM97 and S00 models the data are inconsistent with the PMS population being drawn from a\nsingle coeval isochrone, at confidence levels of 99.6 and 96.3\nper cent respectively. These must be considered lower-limits\nto the model-rejection confidence level because the mean age\nwas adjusted as a free parameter to minimise the K-S statistic. The \"best-fitting\" ages are log10 (age/Myr) of 5.88 and\n6.25 for the DAM97 and S00 models respectively. These are\nsimilar to, but slightly older than, the median ages found\nfrom the H-R diagrams in section 2, but note that values\ndetermined from the projected radii are independent of the\nassumed distance to the ONC and unaffected by the binary\nstatus of any of the stars.\nFig. 5 shows that the coeval models are too narrow in\nR sin i. Obviously a radius (or age) spread could broaden\nthe model distribution, but so too could a decrease in the\nassumed value of ith or an increase in the assumed Teff uncertainties. To test this I ran the coeval S00 models assuming ith = 15\u25e6 . Table 1 shows the \"best-fit\" parameters and\nthat the coeval model is still rejected with \u2243 90 per cent\nconfidence. Conversely, if ith were greater than 30\u25e6 a coeval\nmodel would be an even poorer match to the data. I next\ntried broadening the model R sin i distribution by increasing\nthe uncertainty in Teff . The model can still be rejected at\n> 90 per cent confidence unless the Teff uncertainties are\napproximately doubled to 300 K, which is equivalent to a\n\u00b12 spectral subclass (1-sigma) uncertainty in the spectral\ntypes. Note again that these confidence levels are lower limits because the mean age was tuned to minimise the K-S\nstatistic.\nI conclude that unless the uncertainties in spectral classification and Teff have been significantly underestimated by\nHillenbrand (1997), then the observed values of R sin i are\ninconsistent with coevality at a reasonably high level of confidence.\n\n\f6\n\nR.D.

The distribution of normalised (R sin i)obs for the rotation sample compared with models that have a Gaussian distribution in\nlog10 R around an isochronal value. The left hand panel shows the comparison for Gaussian sigmas of 0.05, 0.15 and 0.27 respectively \u2013\ncorresponding to the best fit value and the values below or above which the model can be rejected with > 90 per cent confidence. R3Myr\nwas calculated using the S00 models. The right hand panel shows the normalised probability distribution, integrated over all possible\ncentral Rtrue /R3Myr values (using either the S00 models [solid line] or the DAM97 models [dashed line]), that these distributions are\nconsistent with the observed data as a function of the Gaussian dispersion, \u03c3r . The results using both evolutionary models suggest a\nsignificant and similar spread in radii. The vertical dashed lines enclose 90 per cent of the probability in the case of the S00 models.\n\n4.3\n\nA radius dispersion\n\nUsing model 2 (a Gaussian distribution of log10 R about a\ncentral value defined by a single isochronal age with a standard deviation of \u03c3r ), I simulated a dispersion in radius\nabout an isochronal value. The central isochronal age was\nagain adjusted to minimise the K-S statistic and a range of\n\u03c3r was tested. The results, using the S00 models to calculate R3Myr , are listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 6.\nIf the dispersion increases to \u03c3r > 0.05 then this model\ncan no longer be rejected with > 90 per cent confidence.\nThe \"best fit\" dispersion corresponds to \u03c3r = 0.15, whilst\nthe model distribution becomes too broad and can be rejected with > 90 per cent confidence if \u03c3r > 0.27. The results using the DAM97 models are similar \u2013 models with\n0.08 < \u03c3r < 0.24 cannot be rejected with better than 90 per\ncent confidence \u2013 but the required central isochronal age\nis still smaller (log10 (age/Myr) is 5.88 compared with 6.25\nwhen using the S00 models \u2013 see Table 1).\nThe results above cannot be used to estimate confidence\nintervals on the best fitting value of \u03c3r , because the central\nisochronal age has been optimised in each case. The right\nhand panel of Fig. 6 shows a normalised probability distribution as a function of \u03c3r (calculated using the S00 models),\nwhere the probability has been integrated over a wide range\nof possible mean ages. This illustrates that the best fitting\n\u03c3r is indeed about 0.15, with 90 per cent of the probability distribution contained between 0.08 and 0.24. The results\nusing the DAM97 models are very similar and give a slightly\nnarrower 90 per cent confidence interval of 0.10 < \u03c3r < 0.22.\nThe Monte Carlo models suggest that the observed\nR sin i distribution can be well represented if the observed\npopulation has a spread, amounting to a full-width at half\nmaximum of 0.2\u20130.5 dex, in the stellar radii around an\nisochronal value. This result is almost independent of which\nevolutionary models are considered. An obvious interpretation is that this is caused by a spread in ages and this is\ninvestigated in the next subsection.\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n4.4\n\nAn age spread\n\nTwo separate models for an age spread were tested. The first\nwas a Gaussian distribution of log10 age around a central\nisochrone. The free parameters were the central age and the\nage dispersion (in logarithmic units), \u03c3a . The second model\nwas an age distribution which is zero up to some starting\nage, jumps to a maximum and then decays exponentially\nwith a decay constant, \u03bba , expressed in Myr. This latter\nmodel, with a suitably small starting age, represents the exponentially accelerating star formation model advocated by\nPalla & Stahler (1999). The lowest starting age considered\nwas 0.03 Myr.\nAges drawn randomly from the Gaussian age distribution were transformed into radii using the appropriate stellar\nmodels (at the Teff of each star in the observational dataset)\nand these radii were perturbed according to the 150 K Teff\nuncertainties and then subjected to the measurement uncertainties, random axial orientations and selection effects\nbefore comparing the observed and modelled distribution of\nR sin i/R3Myr . A grid of models covering a wide range of\ncentral ages and age dispersion was calculated for both the\nDAM97 and S00 models. Assuming that the \"correct\" solution lay within this grid, I normalised the K-S probabilities\nand this gave a pair of relative probability grids which are\nshown in Figs. 7a and 7b. Projection of these grids onto the\nage dispersion axis gave a best fitting \u03c3a and a confidence\ninterval (analogous to the procedure used to create Fig. 6)\nwhich are listed in Table 2. The same procedure was used\nfor the exponential age distribution, with the grid projected\nonto the \u03bba axis. The normalised probability grids for this\ndistribution are shown in Figs. 8a and 8b and the numerical\nresults are also listed in Table 2.\nThere are acceptable fits to the observational data for\nboth Gaussian and exponential age distributions and for\nboth the DAM97 and S00 models. Hence the current data\nare incapable of distinguishing between these possibilities.\nAs expected, the 90 per cent confidence intervals on \u03c3a and\n\n\f8\n\nR.D.

Conversely, a larger ith would increase\nthe required age dispersion.\n\n4.5\n\nAges based on the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram\n\nAs a final test I constructed age distributions based upon\nthe ages determined from the H-R diagram for the rotation sample, which are shown in the right hand panels of\nFigs. 2 and 3. These age distributions were used to construct\nmodel R sin i/R3Myr distributions which in turn were comc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\npared with the observed R sin i/R3Myr distributions via K-S\ntests. Initially, ith was fixed at 30\u25e6 . A further set of models\nwas generated with ith = 15\u25e6 to investigate the influence of\nthis parameter.\nThe comparison between the model and observed distributions of R sin i/R3Myr are shown in Fig. 9. Numerical results are listed in Table 3. All of the model distributions are\nformally compatible with the data and cannot be rejected\nat the 90 per cent confidence level, although the DAM97\nith = 30\u25e6 model barely passes this test. Hence the age distributions determined from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\ncannot be discounted as a valid description of the age distribution required by the projected radii. Given the uncertainties in determining ages from the H-R diagram \u2013 binarity, accretion, reddening, variability (see Hartmann 2001) \u2013\nthat do not afflict determinations of the projected radii, this\nmight seem somewhat surprising. One might have thought\nthat the age distributions from the H-R diagram would be\ntoo broad because of these additional sources of error.\nThe overall uncertainties in the luminosities have been\nconsidered by a number of authors (e.g. Hillenbrand 1997;\nHartmann 2001; Rebull et al. 2004), who have concluded\nthat Gaussian uncertainties in log 10 luminosity are in the\nrange 0.16\u20130.20 dex. This leads approximately to Gaussian\nuncertainties in deduced age of 0.24\u20130.30 dex for PMS stars\n(Hartmann 2001). In section 4.4 I found that the age dispersion required to explain the normalised projected radius\ndistribution was probably larger than this. Hence it seems\nthat the uncertainties that affect the H-R diagram-based\nages are not large enough to significantly broaden the de-\n\n\f10\n\nR.D.

Slesnick et al.\n(2004) also found evidence for an older population in the\nONC H-R diagram they assembled, but argued it might be\ndue to younger stars which are viewed in scattered light\nfrom circumstellar material. Hartmann (2001) asserted that\nthese large age spreads could be an artefact of observational\nerrors, binarity, variability, differential reddening and accretion luminosity that conspire to cause an observed spread in\nthe H-R diagram that is not due to a significant spread in\nage. Hartmann (2001) demonstrated that symmetric uncertainties in log10 luminosity can lead to the appearance of an\nexponentially decaying linear age distribution (see Fig. 2).\nPalla et al. (2007) support their argument for a true age\nspread by showing that a few percent of the ONC PMS\npopulation show evidence of lithium depletion which is consistent with ages > 10 Myr.\nThe evidence presented in this paper supports the idea\nthat at a given Teff , the ONC stars in our sample do exhibit a spread in radius (and hence luminosity) that is not\nconsistent with isochronal radii at a single age. One interpretation of this is that the ONC stars have a range of ages.\nOur modelling shows that plausible age distributions can\nbe hypothesised which do explain the observed dispersion\nin radii. These distributions have spreads in age which are\nlarger than the median age of the sample.\nIt is worth emphasising that the technique employed\nhere is independent of whether stars have correctly estimated reddening, whether they are accreting, whether their\ndistance is correctly estimated and other sources of uncertainty in calculating their luminosities (see Hillenbrand\n1997). The method does depend on reasonable estimates of\nthe measurement uncertainties in v sin i and Teff and the\n\nassumption that axial orientations are random. The latter\nassumption is difficult to support or falsify at present (see\ndiscussion in Jeffries 2007), although any concentration of\ninclination angle would require a greater spread of intrinsic\nradii or ages to match the observed spread in R sin i.\nA spread in ages is not the only way of explaining a\ndispersion in radius at a given Teff . For instance Tout, Livio\n& Bonnell (1999) show that an \"age spread\" in the H-R\ndiagram could be produced in a coeval population of PMS\nstars if they have very different accretion histories. Irrespective of whether the spread in radii found here is interpreted\nin terms of a spread in age, there are important consequences\nfor those using the ONC (and other young star forming\nregions) to investigate evolutionary trends of angular momentum loss, magnetic activity and circumstellar discs (e.g.\nHerbst et al. 2005) and for those using evolutionary models\nto estimate masses and find the (sub)stellar mass function.\nIn these cases, the often-used assumption that stars in a\ngiven cluster are close-to-coeval or have similar properties\n(luminosity, radius) at a given mass or Teff , is not valid.\nThe sample examined in this paper is subject to a number of limitations. Foremost among these is that I have only\nbeen able to comment on the radius distribution of those\nstars for which periods and v sin i measurements are available. Following the discussion in section 2, it is clear that\nthis \"rotation sample\" is deficient in the small tail of stars\nwhich form the controversial elderly population discussed by\nPalla & Stahler (1999) and Palla et al. (2007).\nWhilst the H-R diagram-based age distribution does a\nreasonable job of reproducing the observed distribution of\nprojected radii, it would be unwise to extrapolate and conclude that the H-R diagram-based ages of the apparently\nelderly population are reliable. The likely non-Gaussian behaviour of some of the causes of uncertainty in PMS luminosities (e.g. accretion disk scattering or variability) means\nthat this small fraction of outliers could yet be objects\nwhose average intrinsic luminosity has been severely underestimated. Fortunately, the determination of periods is still\nquite feasible for the fainter ONC members. Large telescopes\nwith multi-object, high resolution spectroscopic capability\nshould then be capable of determining v sin i for some fracc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fAge spreads in the ONC\ntion of these. Even a small number of R sin i values for these\nobjects would be capable of revealing whether they have\nsmaller radii than the rest of the ONC population, as expected from their relative positions in the H-R diagram.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI have taken a sample of PMS objects in the ONC with\nknown rotation periods and projected equatorial velocities,\nand modelled the resultant distribution of projected equatorial radii with a simple Monte-Carlo simulation. The simulation assumes that rotation axes are randomly oriented in\nspace and takes into account selection effects and observational uncertainties in the data. A comparison between models constructed using a variety of hypotheses concerning the\nintrinsic distribution of stellar radii leads to the following\nconclusions.\n(i) The observed distribution of projected equatorial radii\nis inconsistent with the hypothesis that the ONC sample\nis coeval with a high level of confidence. This conclusion\ncan only be weakened if uncertainties in spectral types and\ninferred effective temperatures are significantly larger than\nestimated in the original literature sources.\n(ii) A spread in radius (assuming a Gaussian distribution\nin log10 R) of 0.2\u20130.5 dex (full width half maximum) about\nan isochronal locus is required to match the data. This is\nalmost independent of the choice of evolutionary model.\n(iii) If the radius dispersion is modelled in terms of a\ndistribution of ages, then either a Gaussian or exponentially decaying form can feasibly reproduce the data. The\nabsolute values of the median age and age spread or decay\ntimescales depend on which evolutionary models are used,\nbut age spreads must be greater than the median age of the\nONC.\n(iv) The age distributions deduced from a conventional\nH-R diagram adequately reproduce the observed distribution of projected radii, independent of which evolutionary\nmodels are used. This suggests that uncertainties in deriving intrinsic luminosities are sufficiently small for the sample\nconsidered, that they do not mask the underlying spread in\nradii and inferred age.\n(v) The current data are biased in the sense that lowluminosity ONC members, and hence objects that are older\nin the H-R diagram, are not represented in published catalogues of projected equatorial velocity. This means that\nthe radius and inferred age dispersions found here may be\nlower limits. In particular, the possibility that some cluster members are > 10 Myr older than the bulk of the ONC\npopulation cannot be tested. However, given projected equatorial velocities for some of these objects it should easily be\npossible to check whether these objects have smaller radii\nconsistent with their luminosity-based older ages.\n\nREFERENCES\nCohen M., Kuhi L.
