MALDE, on behalf of the CDF and DO collaborations\nDepartment of Physics, DWB, Keble Road, Oxford OX1 3RH, UK\n\u221a\nThe Tevatron, with pp collisions at s =1.96 TeV, can produce all flavors of B hadrons and\nallows for unprecedented studies in the B physics sector. These range from measurements of\nB hadron properties to searches of new physics signatures. The CDF 1 and D0 2 detectors\ncurrently have more than 7 fb\u22121 of data recorded. This paper presents a selection of recent\nresults on lifetimes and flavor changing neutral currents using between 4.3\u20135.0 fb\u22121 of data.\n\n1\n\nB hadron lifetimes\n\nThe experimental measurement of B hadron lifetime ratios is an important test of the theoretical\napproach to B hadron observables known as the heavy quark expansion. The ratio \u03c4 (B + )/\u03c4 (B 0 )\n(charge conjugates are implied throughout) is predicted 3 ,4 ,5 ,6 to be in the range 1.04\u20131.08 and\nthe ratio \u03c4 (\u039b0b )/\u03c4 (B 0 ) in the range 0.83\u20130.95.3 ,6 ,7 The measured world average B + and B 0\nlifetimes are dominated by the Belle experiment.8 Of recent interest is the \u039b0b lifetime. Until 2006\nall measurements were in agreement but lay at the lower end of the theoretically expected value.\nSince then, two high precision CDF measurements are significantly above previous results.9 ,10\nThe analysis described here is the most precise measurement of the B + , B 0 , and \u039b0b lifetimes\nand ratios.\nThe B + , B 0 , and \u039bb lifetimes were measured using 4.3 fb\u22121 of data with decay channels\nB + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2217 , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8Ks and \u039bb \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039b. In previous measurements the\nuncertainty due to detector resolution has been a leading source of systematic uncertainty. In\nthis analysis the proper decay time is determined using the J/\u03c8 vertex to provide similarity in\nthe decay time resolution between channels and to allow for the cancellation of certain systematic\nuncertainties. A detailed resolution model is also introduced in this analysis. The signal decay\ntime is modelled as an exponential decay convolved with the resolution model. The resolution\nmodel is a superposition of three Gaussians. They are each centred at t = 0, and have a\nwidth of event decay time uncertainty, \u03c3ict , multiplied by a scale factor. The restriction to\nmodels symmetric about t = 0 is motivated by simulation, while the number of components is\ndetermined from data. The parameters of the resolution function are determined from the mass\nsidebands as the fraction of background events expected to originate from the primary vertex is\nbetween 80-90%, depending on channel and background model, and therefore provides a useful\nsample from which to determine the resolution. The overall fit is an unbinned likelihood fit to\nthe mass, decay time and decay time uncertainty distributions simultaneously. The projections\nof the mass and decay time distributions from the \u039bb data are shown in Fig. 1.\nWe measure \u03c4B + = 1.639 \u00b1 0.009 (stat) \u00b1 0.009 (syst) ps, \u03c4B 0 = 1.507 \u00b1 0.010 (stat) \u00b1\n\n\f400\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary 4.3 fb\nEvents/50\u03bcm\n\nEvents/2 Mev/c\n\nData\nData fit\nSideband region\n\n500\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary 4.3 fb\n\n10\n\nData\nSignal\nBkg\nSignal+Bkg\n\n3\n\n102\n300\n\n10\n\n200\n\n100\n\n1\n0\n\n5.5\n\n5.55\n\n5.6\n\n5.65\n\n5.7\n5.75\n2\nMass (J/ \u03c8 \u039b )[GeV/c ]\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n-0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\nct (J/\u03c8 \u039b ) [cm]\n\nFigure 1: The \u039bb mass and proper decay time distributions.\n\n0.008 (syst) ps, and \u03c4\u039b0 = 1.537 \u00b1 0.045 (stat) \u00b1 0.014 (syst) ps. The lifetime ratios are calb\nculated as \u03c4B + /\u03c4B 0 = 1.088 \u00b1 0.009 (stat) \u00b1 0.004 (syst) and \u03c4\u039b0 /\u03c4B 0 = 1.020 \u00b1 0.030 (stat) \u00b1\nb\n0.008 (syst). 11 These are the world's best measurements of the lifetimes and ratios. The improvement in the systematic uncertainty from 0.033 ps (1.0 fb\u22121 to 0.014 ps (4.3 fb\u22121 ) is evident\nin the \u03c4 (\u039bb ) measurement. The \u039bb lifetime remains higher than the world average but is not\ninconsistent with theoretical predictions.\nMeasurements of other B baryon lifetimes are also interesting as they can validate the\nprediction of the baryon hierarchy and ratios. CDF and D0 have both observed the \u039eb12 ,13 and\nthe \u03a9b14 ,15 baryons. CDF has performed lifetime measurements on these samples. The low\nstatistics, particularly in background motivates a different approach to lifetime measurement.\nThe data are divided into bins of proper decay time. A mass fit in each bin determines the\nnumber of signal candidates in each bin. The lifetime is then determined from the yield in each\nbin compared to the expected distribution for a given lifetime. The method has been validated\non \u039bb and B 0 decay modes and gives results consistent with those from other methods. Using\n4.3 fb\u22121 CDF measures \u03c4 (\u039eb ) = 1.56+0.27\n\u22120.25 (stat) \u00b1 0.02(syst) ps which is the first measurement\nusing a fully reconstructed decay of \u039eb , and \u03c4 (\u03a9b ) = 1.13+0.53\n\u22120.40 (stat) \u00b1 0.02(syst) ps which is the\n15\nfirst measurement of \u03c4 (\u03a9b ) .\n2\n\nFlavor Changing Neutral Currents\n\nFlavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) are forbidden at tree-level in the standard model.\nProcesses that involve FCNC through higher order diagrams can provide information on new\nphysics. New particles participating in the higher order diagrams can enhance decay rates or\nalter expected kinematic distributions from the standard model predictions. FCNC provide a\ncomplementary approach to new physics searches alongside direct searches, as any signatures\nof new physics that are observed give information on the flavour structure of new physics, and\nthus constrain the set of new physics models that are consistent with data observations.\n2.1\n\nB \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\nOne highly studied decay is Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . The standard model branching fraction is16 (3.42 \u00b1\n0.54)\u00d710\u22129 which is beyond the CDF and D0 detector experimental sensitivity.However, these\nbranching ratios can be enhanced by a factor of 10\u2212100 by supersymmetric models or other new\nphysics. The decay B 0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is further suppressed by the ratio of CKM elements, |Vtd /Vts |2 .\nGiven the detector sensitivities, observation of either decay is an unequivocal signature of new\nphysics. If observed, the ratio of measured Bs and B 0 branching fractions would give information\non the flavor structure of the new physics.\n\n\fThe analyses carried out at CDF and D0 are similar; the CDF analysis uses 3.7 fb\u22121 and is\ndescribed below. One challenge in this analysis is to reduce the large backgrounds. A number\nof baseline selection requirements are applied which result in a reduction of background by a\nfactor of 300 while 50% of signal would remain in the geometric and kinematic acceptance of the\ndetector. The baseline selection includes selection on transverse momentum, vertex quality, and\nmuon ID algorithms which reduce backgrounds where hadrons have been misidentified as muons\nand decays involving a kaon that has decayed inflight to a muon. For further enhancement of\nsignal events a neural network is used. It is trained on six variables; the proper decay time\nand proper decay time significance, the transverse momentum of the di-muon candidate, the Bcandidate track isolation, the pT of the lower momentum muon candidate, and the 3D opening\nangle between the vectors p~\u03bc\u03bc and the displacement vector between the primary vertex and the\ndimuon vertex. The neural network is trained using signal events generated by Monte Carlo\nand mass sideband events for background. The neural network output is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe remaining background is estimated from continuum combinatorics from sidebands and misreconstructed B \u2192 hh decays which peaks in the signal region. The background estimates\nare cross-checked using control samples from data such as like-sign muons. The background\npredictions are compared with the observed data and no statistically significant discrepancies\nare observed.\nA relative normalisation to the channel B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + is used to determine the B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\nbranching fraction. The number of observed signal events, Ns , and normalization events, N+ ,\ncan be used to obtain the branching fraction via:\nB(Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) =\n\nNs \u01eb+ fu\n*\n*\n* B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ),\nN+ \u01ebs fs\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fu , fs are fragmentation fractions and \u01eb+ and \u01ebs are the efficiencies for the normalisation\nand signal channels. The efficiencies are determined through a combination of Monte Carlo\nsimulation and data driven techniques involving samples of J/\u03c8, B \u2192 J/\u03c8K + and B \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6.\nAfter selection, the data observed in the mass ranges corresponding to Bs and B 0 are\nconsistent with there being only background events and are shown in Fig 2 in three separate bins of the neural network discriminant. CDF sets limits on the branching fractions for\nthese decay processes. Using a data sample of 3.7 fb\u22121 CDF extracts a 95% (90%) C.L for\nB(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 (3.6) \u00d7 10\u22128 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 (6.0) \u00d7 10\u22129 . 17 These\nare the world's best limits on these branching ratios. At D0 an analysis of 2 fb\u22121 obtained a\nlimit of B(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 9.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 (7.5) \u00d7 10\u22128 . 18 The analysis of 5 fb\u22121 is on-going with the\nsignal region still blinded. The expected upper limit on the branching fraction on these data\nis B(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 (4.3) \u00d7 10\u22128 . 19 These measurements at the Tevatron have limited the parameter space of allowed new physics models as large enhancements of the B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\nbranching ratio are inconsistent with the observed data.\n2.2\n\nB \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 h\n\nOne group of interesting decays to study are B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bch where the B is either B + , B 0 or Bs and h\nstands for either K + , K \u2217 or \u03c6, respectively. The branching ratios of these decays are O(10\u22126 ) and\nare observable. New physics processes can enhance decay amplitudes. The interference between\namplitudes due to new physics particles and the standard model processes may be observable in\neffect on branching ratios, polarisation and forward backward asymmetry. Comparison of these\nobservables to standard model expectation can indicate whether the underlying dynamics are\ngoverned by the standard model or other models such as SUSY, or 4th generation quarks.\nThe three decay channels are reconstructed from data collected by triggers that require\ntwo charged particles with pT \u2265 1.5GeV/c or 2.0 GeV/c with corresponding hits in the muon\n\n\f2\n\n-1\n\n50\n\nBd\n\n40\n\nBs\n\nCDF Preliminary 3.7 fb\n0.8<\u03bdNN<0.95\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n4.8\n\n5\n\n5.2\n\n5.4\n\n5.6\n\nBackground (Sidebands)\n\n5.8\n2\nM \u03bc+ \u03bc- [GeV/c ]\n\n2\n\n10-1\n\nCandidates / 24 MeV/c\n\nFraction per 0.02\n\nBs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc- Signal\n\nCandidates / 24 MeV/c\n\n-1\n\nCDF Preliminary 3.7 fb\n1\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nNNout\n\nCandidates / 24 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n10-2\n\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\nBd Bs\n\n4.8\n\n5\n\n5.2\n\n5.4\n\n0.95<\u03bdNN<0.995\n\n5.6\n\n5.8\n2\nM \u03bc+ \u03bc- [GeV/c ]\n\n10\n\nBd\n\n8\n\nBs\n\n0.995<\u03bdNN<1.0\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n4.8\n\n5\n\n5.2\n\n5.4\n\n5.6\n\n5.8\n2\nM \u03bc+ \u03bc- [GeV/c ]\n\nFigure 2: The left plot shows the neural network discriminant for signal and background.

Vertices comprising of the muon pair and the h are required to have a \u03c72 probability\nof at least 10\u22123 . For the normalisation of the branching ratios the control channels B \u2192 J/\u03c8h\nare also reconstructed. The same final state allows a number of systematic uncertainties to\ncancel. Selection criteria are placed on the decay time significance, transverse momentum,\nimpact parameter of the B candidate, the \u03c6 and K \u2217 mass, and particle identification to reduce\nthe combinatoric and fake muon backgrounds. The normalisation channels are required to\nhave the di-muon invariant mass within 50 MeV/c2 of the J/\u03c8 mass. For the signal channels,\ncandidates with a di-muon mass in the region near the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 are rejected. Other criteria\nare applied to reduce other peaking backgrounds. After the loose selection a neural network\ntechnique is used to provide the final selection. It is optimised to maximise both the branching\nratio and the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, AF B , significance.\nThe signal yield is determined from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the B invariant\nmass distribution. The signal shape is two Gaussians with different means, and is determined\nfrom Monte Carlo with the B mass resolution scaled to data in the normalisation channels. The\nbackground is a first or second order polynomial. The mass distribution and yields are shown in\nFigure 3. For each channel a significance greater than 6\u03c3 is observed. The measured branching\nratios are B(B + \u2192 K + \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = [0.38 \u00b1 0.05(stat) \u00b1 0.03(syst)] \u00d7 10\u22126 , B(B 0 \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) =\n[1.06\u00b10.14(stat)\u00b10.09(syst)]\u00d710\u22126 , B(Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = [1.44\u00b10.33(stat)\u00b10.46(syst)]\u00d710\u22126 . 20\nThese numbers are consistent with previous results and other B-factory measurements. In the\ncase of Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03bc\u03bc, this is the first observation of this decay channel and is also the rarest Bs\ndecay observed so far.\nThe differential branching ratio as a function of the di-muon invariant mass is determined\nby binning the data into 6 bins and repeating the branching ratio measurement. The 6 bins\nare chosen to correspond to the analysis performed at Belle to aid comparison between the two\nexperiments. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The region consistent with the standard model\nis between the two lines; this band exists due to uncertainty in form factors. No inconsistency\nwith the standard model is observed.\nThe B + and B 0 decays are used to determine AF B and the longitudinal polarisation of the\n\u2217\nK . The theoretical uncertainty on the standard model prediction has very small uncertainty\nand hence provides an interesting opportunity to observe the effects of new physics. AF B is\ndetermined from the distribution of cos(\u03b8\u03bc ), where \u03b8\u03bc is the helicity angle between the \u03bc+ (\u03bc\u2212 )\ndirection and the opposite of the B(B\u0304) direction in the di-muon rest frame. The polarisation\nis measured from \u03b8K where this is the angle between the kaon direction and the direction\nopposite to the B meson in the K\u2217 rest frame. The fit results are shown in Fig. 5, where one\npossible beyond the standard model scenario is also shown. The results are consistent with the\n\n\fYield:120 \u00b1 16 (142 expected)\nMass:5277 \u00b1 3 MeV/c2\n\n100\n\nB+\u2192 K+\u03bc+\u03bc80\n\nData\nTotal Fit\nSignal\n\n60\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary L=4.4fb-1\n60\n\nYield:101 \u00b1 12 (102 expected)\nMass:5284 \u00b1 3 MeV/c2\nB0\u2192 K*0\u03bc+\u03bc-\n\n50\n\nData\nTotal Fit\nSignal\n\n40\n\nBackground\n\nEvents / (20 MeV/c2)\n\nEvents / (20 MeV/c2)\n\nEvents / (20 MeV/c2)\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary L=4.4fb-1\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary L=4.4fb-1\n22\n20\n\nYield:27 \u00b1 6 (31 expected)\nMass:5365 \u00b1 5 MeV/c2\nB0s\u2192 \u03c6\u03bc+\u03bc-\n\n18\n\nData\n\n16\n\nTotal Fit\nSignal\n\n14\n\nBackground\n\nBackground\n\n12\n\n30\n\n10\n\n40\n\n8\n20\n6\n\n20\n\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n0\n5\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n5.6\n5.7\nM(\u03bc\u03bcK) (GeV/c2)\n\n0\n5\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n0\n5\n\n5.5\n5.6\n5.7\n*\nM(\u03bc\u03bcK ) (GeV/c2)\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n5.6\n5.7\nM(\u03bc\u03bc\u03c6) (GeV/c2)\n\n0.6\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary L=4.4fb-1\n\ndBr/dq2 (10-7/GeV 2/c2)\n\ndBr/dq2 (10-7/GeV 2/c2)\n\nFigure 3: The mass distribution of B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bch candidates after selection.\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary L=4.4fb-1\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nq2 (GeV2/c2)\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nq2 (GeV2/c2)\n\nFigure 4: The differential branching ratios for B + (right) and B 0 (left).

The\nresults presented here have shown the possibilities of hadron colliders for measurements in flavor\nphysics despite the high combinatoric backgrounds. The contribution to lifetimes will be used to\nbetter understand the interaction of quarks inside hadrons. The indirect searches of new physics\nthrough flavor physics observables remain complementary to direct searches.\nThe Tevatron accelerator continues to provide a high luminosity and these analyses can be\nexpected to be updated with 10 fb\u22121 . This will allow for significantly improved measurements for\nthe measurements that are currently limited by statistical uncertainty. This will be particularly\ninteresting for B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and B \u2192 \u03bc\u03bch where hints of new physics could be observed.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank the University of Pittsburgh for the financial support that enabled my participation at\nthis conference.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nD.
