We also report the most precise tests to date of isospin invariance\nin semileptonic D 0 and D + decays.\n\n2\n\n\fThe quark mixing parameters are fundamental constants of the Standard Model (SM)\nof particle physics. They determine the nine weak-current quark coupling elements of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1]. The extraction of the quark couplings is\ndifficult because quarks are bound inside hadrons by the strong interaction. Semileptonic\ndecays are the preferred way to determine the CKM matrix elements as the strong interaction\nbinding effects are confined to the hadronic current. They are parameterized by form factors\nthat are calculable, for example, by lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and QCD sum\nrules. Nevertheless, form factor uncertainties dominate the precision with which the CKM\nmatrix elements can be determined [2]. In charm quark decays, however, couplings Vcs and\nVcd are tightly constrained by the unitarity of the CKM matrix. Therefore, measurements\nof charm semileptonic decay rates and form factors rigorously test theoretical predictions.\nWe report herein measurements with the first CLEO-c data [3] of the absolute branching\nfractions of D + decays to K\u0304 0 e+ \u03bde , \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde , K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde , and \u03c10 e+ \u03bde , and the first observation\nand absolute branching fraction measurement of D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde . (Throughout this Letter\ncharge-conjugate modes are implied.) We combine these results with the measurements\nof D 0 semileptonic branching fractions reported in Ref. [4], which use the same data and\nanalysis technique, and test isospin invariance of the hadronic current in semileptonic decays.\nThe data were collected by the CLEO-c detector at the \u03c8(3770) resonance, about 40 MeV\nabove the D D\u0304 pair production threshold. A description of the CLEO-c detector is provided\nin Ref. [4] and references therein. The data sample consists of an integrated luminosity of\n55.8 pb\u22121 and includes about 0.16 million D + D \u2212 events.\nThe technique for these measurements was first applied by the Mark III collaboration [5]\nat SPEAR. Candidate events are selected by reconstructing a D \u2212 , called a tag, in the\nfollowing six hadronic final states: KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 , K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 , KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and\nK \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . The absolute branching fractions of D + semileptonic decays are then measured\nby their reconstruction in the system recoiling from the tag. Tagging a D \u2212 meson in a\n\u03c8(3770) decay provides a D + with known four-momentum, allowing a semileptonic decay\nto be reconstructed with no kinematic ambiguity, even though the neutrino is undetected.\nTagged events are selected based on two variables: \u2206E \u2261 ED \u2212 Ebeam , the difference\nbetween the energy of the D \u2212 q\ntag candidate (ED ) and the beam energy (Ebeam ), and the\n2\nbeam-constrained mass Mbc \u2261 Ebeam\n/c4 \u2212 |~pD |2 /c2 , where ~pD is the measured momentum\nof the D \u2212 candidate. Selection criteria for tracks, \u03c0 0 and KS0 candidates for tags are described\nin Ref. [6]. If multiple candidates are present in the same tag mode, one candidate per tag\ncharge is chosen using \u2206E. The yields of the six tag modes are obtained from fits to the\nMbc distributions. The data sample comprises approximately 32,000 charged tags (Table I).\nAfter a tag is identified, we search for a positron and a set of hadrons recoiling against the\ntag. (Muons are not used as D semileptonic decays at the \u03c8(3770) produce low momentum\nleptons for which the CLEO-c muon identification is not efficient.) Positron candidates,\nselected with criteria described in Ref. [4], are required to have momentum of at least\n200 MeV/c and to satisfy | cos \u03b8| < 0.90, where \u03b8 is the angle between the positron direction and the beam axis. The efficiency for positron identification rises from about 50% at\n200 MeV/c to 95% just above 300 MeV/c and is roughly constant thereafter. The rates for\nmisidentifying charged pions and kaons as positrons averaged over the momentum range are\napproximately 0.1%. Bremsstrahlung photons are recovered by the procedure described in\nRef. [4].\nHadronic tracks must have momenta above 50 MeV/c and | cos \u03b8| < 0.93. Identification of\nhadrons is based on measurements of specific ionization (dE/dx) in the main drift chamber\n3\n\n\fTag Mode\nD \u2212 \u2192 KS0 \u03c0 \u2212\nD\u2212 \u2192 K +\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0\u2212\nD \u2212 \u2192 KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0\nD\u2212 \u2192 K +\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0\u2212 \u03c00\nD \u2212 \u2192 KS0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 +\nD\u2212 \u2192 K \u2212K + \u03c0\u2212\nAll Tags\n\nYield\n2243 \u00b1 51\n15174 \u00b1 128\n5188 \u00b1 100\n4734 \u00b1 91\n3281 \u00b1 94\n1302 \u00b1 44\n31922 \u00b1 219\n\nTABLE I: Tag yields of the six D \u2212 hadronic modes with statistical uncertainties.\n\nand information from the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH). Pion and kaon candidates are required to have dE/dx measurements within three standard deviations (3.0\u03c3) of\nthe expected value. For tracks with momenta greater than 700 MeV/c, RICH information,\nif available, is combined with dE/dx. The efficiencies (95% or higher) and misidentification\nrates (a few per cent) are determined with charged pion and kaon samples from hadronic D\ndecays.\nWe form \u03c0 0 candidates from pairs of photons, each having an energy of at least 30 MeV,\nand require that the invariant mass of the pair be within 3.0\u03c3 (\u03c3 \u223c 6 MeV/c2 ) of the\nknown \u03c0 0 mass. A mass constraint is imposed when \u03c0 0 candidates are used in further\nreconstruction. The KS0 candidates are formed from pairs of oppositely-charged and vertexconstrained tracks having an invariant mass within 12 MeV/c2 (\u223c 4.5\u03c3) of the known KS0\nmass. We form a K\u0304 \u22170 (\u03c10 ) candidate from K \u2212 and \u03c0 + (\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + ) candidates and require\nan invariant mass within 100 MeV/c2 (150 MeV/c2 ) of its mean value. The reconstruction of\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 candidates is achieved by combining three pions, requiring an invariant mass\nwithin 20 MeV/c2 of the known mass, and demanding that the charged pions do not satisfy\ninterpretation as a KS0 .\nThe tag and the semileptonic decay are then combined, if the event includes no tracks\nother than those of the tag and the semileptonic candidate. Semileptonic decays are identified using the variable U \u2261 Emiss \u2212 c|~pmiss |, where Emiss and ~pmiss are the missing energy and\nmomentum of the D meson decaying semileptonically. If the decay products of the semileptonic decay have been correctly identified, U is expected to be zero, since only a neutrino is\nundetected. The resolution in U is improved using constraints described in Ref. [4]. Due to\nthe finite resolution of the detector, the distribution in U is approximately Gaussian, centered at U = 0 with \u03c3 \u223c 10 MeV. (The width varies by mode and is larger for modes with\nneutral pions.) To remove multiple candidates in each semileptonic mode, one combination\nis chosen per tag mode, based on the proximity of the invariant masses of the KS0 , K\u0304 \u22170 , \u03c10 ,\n\u03c0 0 , or \u03c9 candidates to their expected masses.\nThe yield for each semileptonic mode is determined from a fit to its U distribution, as\nshown in Fig. 1 with all tag modes combined. In each case the signal is represented by a\nGaussian and a Crystal Ball function [7] to account for initial and final state radiation (FSR).\nThe parameters describing the tails of the signal function are fixed with a GEANT-based\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation [8]. The background functions are determined by a MC simulation that incorporates all available data on D meson decays. The backgrounds are small\nand arise mostly from misreconstructed semileptonic decays with correctly reconstructed\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: Fits (solid line) to the U distributions in data (dots with error bars) for the five D +\nsemileptonic modes: (a) D + \u2192 K\u0304 0 e+ \u03bde , (b) D + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde , (c) D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde , (d) D + \u2192 \u03c10 e+ \u03bde\nand (e) D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde . The background contribution is the dashed line only visible in (c) and (d).\nThe arrows show the signal region for D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde .\n\ntags [9]. The background shape parameters are fixed, while the background normalizations\nare allowed to float in all fits to the data.\nThe mode D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde has never previously been observed. There are 8 events consistent\nwith D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde in Fig. 1 (e). The background in the signal region ([\u221225; +30] MeV in U)\nis estimated to be 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 events. The probability for the background of 0.6 events to\nfluctuate to 8 or more events is 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22127, which corresponds to significance exceeding 5.0\u03c3.\nTherefore, this is the first observation of D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde .\nThe absolute branching fractions in Table II are determined using B = Nsignal /\u01ebNtag ,\nwhere Nsignal is the number of fully reconstructed D + D \u2212 events obtained by fitting the U\ndistribution, Ntag is the number of events with a reconstructed tag, and \u01eb is the effective\nefficiency for detecting the semileptonic decay in an event with an identified tag. A MC\nsimulation where the relative population of tag yields across tag modes approximates that\nin the data is used to determine the efficiency.\nWe have considered the following sources of systematic uncertainty and give our estimates\nof their magnitudes in parentheses. The uncertainties associated with the efficiency for finding a track (0.7%), \u03c0 0 (2.0% for D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde and 4.3% for D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde ) and KS0 (3.0%) are\nestimated using missing mass techniques with the data [6]. Details on the uncertainties associated with positron identification efficiency (1.0%) are provided in Ref. [4]. Uncertainties\nin the charged pion and kaon identification efficiencies (0.3% per pion and 1.3% per kaon)\nare estimated using hadronic D meson decays. The uncertainty in the number of tags (1.1%)\nis estimated by using alternative signal functions in the fits to the Mbc distributions and\nby varying the end point of the background function [10].

The first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic in the fourth column,\nand statistical or total in the other columns. The efficiencies do not include subsidiary branching\nfractions. The D + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde yield is reduced by 2.4% in the calculation of the branching\nfraction (see the text for details).\n\nbackground shapes in the fits to the U distributions (0.4% to 3.3% by mode) has contributions from the uncertainties in the simulation of the positron and hadron fake rates as well\nas the input branching fractions in the MC simulation. The uncertainty associated with\nthe requirement that there be no additional tracks in tagged semileptonic events (0.3%) is\nestimated by comparing fully reconstructed D D\u0304 events in data and MC. The uncertainty in\nthe semileptonic reconstruction efficiencies due to imperfect knowledge of the semileptonic\nform factors is estimated by varying the form factors in the MC simulation within their\nuncertainties (1.0%) for all modes except D + \u2192 \u03c10 e+ \u03bde and D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde ; for these a conservative uncertainty (3.0%) is taken, as no experimental information on the form factors\nin Cabibbo-suppressed pseudoscalar-to-vector transitions exists. The uncertainty associated\nwith the simulation of FSR and bremsstrahlung radiation in the detector material (0.6%)\nis estimated by varying the amount of FSR modeled by the PHOTOS algorithm [11] and\nby repeating the analysis with and without recovery of photons radiated by the positron.\nThe uncertainty associated with the simulation of initial state radiation (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 D D\u0304\u03b3) is\nnegligible. There is a systematic uncertainty due to finite MC statistics (0.7% to 4.0% by\nmode).\nNon-resonant semileptonic decays D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + e+ \u03bde are background to D + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde .\nThere is evidence from the FOCUS experiment for a non-resonant component consistent\nwith an S-wave amplitude interfering with D + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde [13]. Its contribution, estimated\nto be 2.4% in this analysis, is subtracted in the calculation of the branching fraction of\nD + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde [14]. Systematic uncertainties associated with the subtraction are due to\nimperfect knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the non-resonant component (1.0%), and\nits effect on the reconstruction efficiency (1.5%) [15]. The lineshapes for semileptonic modes\nwith wide resonances are simulated using a relativistic Breit-Wigner with a Blatt-Weisskopf\nform factor. A systematic uncertainty associated with the K\u0304 \u22170 lineshape (1.2%) is assigned\nby comparing the (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) invariant mass distribution in the data to alternative lineshapes\nand the non-resonant contribution. For D + \u2192 \u03c10 e+ \u03bde , there is insufficient data to constrain\nthe non-resonant background or the resonance lineshape. The systematic uncertainties from\nthese two sources are expected to be much smaller than the current statistical uncertainty\nfor this mode, and are neglected.\nThese estimates of systematic uncertainty are added in quadrature to obtain the total\nsystematic uncertainty (Table II): 4.2%, 5.6%, 4.1%, 6.2%, and 7.8% for D + \u2192 K\u0304 0 e+ \u03bde ,\n6\n\n\fD + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde , D + \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde , D + \u2192 \u03c10 e+ \u03bde , and D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde , respectively.\nWe now discuss the results presented in this Letter and the D 0 semileptonic study in\nRef. [4]. The measured equality of the inclusive semileptonic widths of D 0 and D + mesons\ndemonstrates that the source of the lifetime difference between them is attributable to\ndifferences in the hadronic widths. The widths of the isospin conjugate exclusive semileptonic\ndecay modes of the D 0 and D + are related by isospin invariance of the hadronic current.\nThe results obtained here and in Ref. [4] allow the most precise tests so far.\n0 \u2192K \u2212 e+ \u03bd )\ne\nThe ratio \u0393(D\nis expected to be unity.

Using the isospin averages in Table IV, we find\n\u0393(D\u2192K \u2217 e+ \u03bd)\n= 0.63 \u00b1 0.03(stat) \u00b1 0.02(syst).\n\u0393(D\u2192Ke+ \u03bd)\n\n7\n\n\fFinally, summing all CLEO-c exclusive semileptonic branching fractions gives\nP\n+\n0\nB(Dexcl\n) = (6.1 \u00b1 0.2(stat) \u00b1 0.2(syst))% and B(Dexcl\n) = (15.1 \u00b1 0.5(stat) \u00b1 0.5(syst))%.\nThese are consistent with the world average inclusive semileptonic branching fractions:\nB(D 0 \u2192 e+ X) = (6.9 \u00b1 0.3)% and B(D + \u2192 e+ X) = (17.2 \u00b1 1.9)% [12], excluding the\npossibility of additional semileptonic modes of the D 0 and D + with large branching fractions.\nIn summary, we have presented the most precise measurements to date of the absolute\nbranching fractions of D + decays to K\u0304 0 e+ \u03bde , \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bde , K\u0304 \u22170 e+ \u03bde , and \u03c10 e+ \u03bde , and the first\nobservation and absolute branching fraction measurement of D + \u2192 \u03c9e+ \u03bde . We have combined these with measurements in Ref. [4], which use the same data and analysis technique,\nto demonstrate that charm exclusive semileptonic decays are consistent with isospin invariance and to test other theoretical predictions. A comparison of the world average inclusive\nsemileptonic branching fractions to the sum of the semileptonic branching fractions in this\nwork excludes the possibility of additional semileptonic modes with large branching fractions.\nThe precision achieved in this analysis is consistent with the expected performance of\nCLEO-c. CESR is currently running to collect a much larger \u03c8(3770) data sample. It\nis expected that this sample will result in greatly improved measurements of D 0 and D +\nsemileptonic branching fractions, measurements of the decay form factors, which are stringent tests of LQCD, and the CKM matrix elements Vcs and Vcd [3].\nWe gratefully acknowledge the effort of the CESR staff in providing us with excellent\nluminosity and running conditions.
