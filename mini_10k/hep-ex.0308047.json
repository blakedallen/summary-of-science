Photo-production of excited mesons in the 1 \u2212 2 GeV mass range decaying via multipion or multi-kaon emission has been investigated at the TJNAF1 experiment E01-017 (g6c) in\nthe 4.8 \u2212 5.4 GeV photon beam energy range. The main objective of the experiment is to extract\nresonance parameters of the produced states by way of a Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) technique.\nIn this paper, we will focus on the general characteristics of the data distributions in both the neutral\nand charged 3-pion final states, i.e. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe observation of an isovector exotic state with J pc = 1\u2212+ quantum numbers at 1.6\nGeV by the Brookhaven E852 experiment [1] provided the main motivation to search for\nsuch a state using a photon beam at JLab. This state is one of the signature hadronic states\noutside the constituent quark model, where either the excitation of the gluons within the\nhadron directly contributes to its degrees of freedom, giving a state configuration of\n(qq\u0304g), or that the state is composed of more than one qq\u0304 pair, i.e. qq\u0304qq\u0304. Such a state, if\nproduced in a pion beam via \u03c1 exchange, may also be produced in a photon beam, with\nthe role of the beam and the exchange particle reversed and assuming Vector Meson\nDominance (VMD) [2, 3, 4]. Photon beams, as probes for exotic meson production, have\nnot been fully explored so far; the existing data on multi-particle final states are very\nsparse. The only relevant data comes from a SLAC bubble chamber experiment which\nemployed a backscattered laser photon beam of 19.5 GeV average energy [5]. In the\nlow mass region, the data is dominated by a2 (1320) production with no clear evidence\nfor a1 (1260). In the high mass region, the group claimed evidence for a narrow state at\n1.775 GeV, with possible J pc = 1\u2212 , 2\u2212, or 3+ quantum numbers. Because of insufficient\nstatistics, no PWA was performed on the data.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND EVENT SELECTION.\nThe data for this analysis was collected during Aug.\u2013Sep. of 2001. The 40 nA primary\nbeam of 5.7 GeV electrons at 100% duty factor and was provided by CEBAF (Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility). The secondary beam of photons was generated\n1\n\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and The U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\n\fin Hall B via bremsstrahlung radiation, using a 3 \u2217 10\u22124 r.l. radiator and a tagging system\nidentifying photons in the [20% \u2212 95%] range of the incident electron beam energy [6].\nThe high flux of 5x106 /sec photons (in the top 15% of the photon beam energy) was\nincident on an 18 cm long LH2 target. The Hall B experimental hall houses the CLAS\n(CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectromenter) detector. CLAS covers a large solid angle\nwith polar angle coverge in the range 8\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 145\u25e6 , and azimuthal angle coverage of\n80%. The detector, composed of six independent sectors, provides a toroidal magnetic\nfield, where positively charged particles bend outward and negatively charged tracks\nbend inward. Three sets of drift chambers in the radial direction are embedded in the\nspace between the coils, and provide charged particle detection and track reconstruction. A set of time of flight scintillators are used for charged particle identification, and\na set of electromagnetic calorimeters are used for neutral particle detection. Details of\nthe CLAS detector design and performance are described elsewhere [7].\nThe lack of acceptance in the forward region (\u03b8lab < 8\u25e6 ) presents a drawback to any\nmeson spectroscopy program at CLAS in its current configuration. In addition, with the\nmaximum available photon beam energy of 5.4 GeV, there is a significant contribution\nfrom t-channel baryon resonance production.\nBoth neutral and charged 3\u03c0 final states were subjected to similar topological and\ngeometrical cuts. The photon beam energy was selected to be higher than 4.8 GeV;\nvertex position cuts were applied to ensure the events originated within the target\nvolume, and vertex timing constraints were imposed to reduce the accidentals between\nthe CLAS and the tagging system.\n\nDATA DISTRIBUTIONS: \u03b3 p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (n)\nThe \u03c0 + , \u03c0 + , and \u03c0 \u2212 were detected in CLAS, and the neutron was reconstructed by\nway of missing mass. In order to suppress the t-channel baryon background, we have\nemployed two kinematical cuts, a low four-momentum transfer to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212 cut\ndefined as \u2212t \u2032 \u2264 0.4 GeV2 , and the other, a small lab polar angle cut imposed on the two\npositively charged pions defined as \u03b8lab \u2264 30\u25e6 . These two cuts, referred to as \"baryon\nrejection cuts\", discard mostly events associated with background processes. In all the\nplots shown for this final state, the shaded histograms represent the events that passed\nthese two cuts collectively.\nThe left plot in Fig. 1 shows the missing mass off the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 for low \u2212t \u2032 events. The\nneutron peak sits on top of a negligible linearly increasing background, with a signal to\nbackground ratio of approximately 9/1. A Gaussian plus a 1st order polynomial fit to the\npeak gives a \u03c3 of 25 MeV. The area between the lines around the neutron peak represents\nthe neutron selection cut. The \u2212t \u2032 distribution shown in the middle plot of Fig. 1 is fit\n\u2032\nto an exponential function of the form f (t \u2032) = a e\u2212b|t | . The shape of the distribution is\nconsistent with the characteristics of peripheral production, and the exponential constant\nof 4.4 GeV\u22122 is consistent with \u03c0 and \u03c1 exchange [8]. In the 3\u03c0 invariant mass spectrum\nshown in the right plot of Fig. 1 two enhancements are evident, one in the 1300 MeV\nregion, and another in the 1600 \u2212 1700 MeV range.\nFigure 2 shows all three possible combinations of the n\u03c0 and \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass distributions.

The two n\u03c0 + combinations\nshow peaks around the known baryon resonances, \u2206(1232), N \u22c6 (1520), and N \u22c6 (1680),\nwhile the n\u03c0 \u2212 shows a peak around the \u2206(1232) only as is expected due to isospin considerations. It is clear from the shaded distributions that the baryon resonance peaks are\ngreatly suppressed after the \"baryon rejection\" cuts. The neutral 2\u03c0 effective mass distributions show signals around the mass of the \u03c1 (770) and the f2 (1270), as well as a\nshoulder at the mass of the f0 (980). The doubly-charged 2\u03c0 combination doesn't show\nany distinct peak, indicative of the lack of an isospin I = 2 state.\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\nm( \u03c0+\n2 \u03c0 ) GeV\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n+\nm( \u03c0+\n1 \u03c02 ) GeV\n\nn\u03c0 (top row) and \u03c0\u03c0 (bottom row) invariant mass distributions for \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (n) events.\n\n\fDATA DISTRIBUTIONS: \u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 0 )\n\n25000\n25000\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n20000\n15000\n10000\n\n15000\n5000\n0\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n5000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n0.1\n\n10000\n\n-0.5\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\nEvents/20 GeV 2\n\nEvents/10 MeV 2\n\nThe p, \u03c0 + , and \u03c0 \u2212 were detected in CLAS while the \u03c0 0 was reconstructed by way of\nmissing mass. In order to enhance the 3\u03c0 mesonic events, a combination of low \u2212t \u2032 and\np\u03c0 mass cut was employed. The cut was defined as 0.1 \u2264 \u2212t \u2032 \u2264 1.0 GeV2 , with the\np\u03c0 effective masses for all three combination above 1.35 GeV. We'll refer to these two\ncuts, as \"baryon rejection cuts\". In all the plots shown for this final state, the shaded\nhistograms represent the events that passed these two cuts.\nThe left plot in Fig. 3 shows the missing mass squared off the p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . A Gaussian\nplus a 2nd order polynomial fit to the peak around the \u03c0 0 gives a \u03c3 of 41 MeV for the\nmissing mass resolution. The region between the lines represents the \u03c0 0 selection cut;\nthese events were subjected to kinematical fitting in a later stage. The \u2212t \u2032 distribution is\nshown in the middle plot of Fig. 3. The shaded distribution, after the \u2206(1232) rejection\n\u2032\ncut is fit to an exponential function, f (t \u2032) = a e\u2212b|t | , with the resulting b = 1.3 GeV\u22122 .\nThe 3\u03c0 invariant mass distribution is shown in the right plot of Fig. 3, with the shaded\nhistogram showing the events which passed the \"baryon rejection cuts\". In the remaining\nevents, one is able to see enhancement of events at 1300 MeV and in the 1600 \u2212 1700\nMeV region.\n\nmm2/(p \u03c0+\u03c0- ) GeV\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n-t' : - (t - t min ) GeV\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4\n\nm(\u03c0+ \u03c0- \u03c00) GeV\n\nFIGURE 3.

Before the \"baryon rejection cuts\", the most prominent feature observed\nis the peak around the \u2206(1232) mass region. After the cuts, the peaks around the\nN \u22c6 (1520) and N \u22c6 (1680) still remain. The invariant mass distributions for the 2\u03c0 charged\ncombinations, \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , show strong peaks at the \u03c1 (770) mass, while the neutral\n2\u03c0 invariant mass distribution shows enhancements around the \u03c1 (770) and f2 (1270)\nmasses.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\nWe have shown the data quality and the general characteristics of the distributions for\nboth the neutral and the charged 3\u03c0 final states from the data collected during the g6c\n\n\f6000\n\n5000\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\n7000\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n3000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n0\n1\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\n0\n1\n\n2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n0\n1\n\n2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n0\n1\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\nm( \u03c0+ \u03c00) GeV\n\nFIGURE 4.\n\n2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n2\n\n10000\n\n6000\n\n0\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\nm(p \u03c0+) GeV\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\n10000\n\n2\n\nm(p \u03c00) GeV\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\nm(p \u03c0-) GeV\n\nEvents/20 MeV\n\n7000\n\n0\n0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\nm( \u03c0+ \u03c0-) GeV\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\nm( \u03c0- \u03c00) GeV\n\np\u03c0 (top row) and \u03c0\u03c0 (bottom row) invariant mass distributions for p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 0 ) events.\n\nrunning of CLAS.
