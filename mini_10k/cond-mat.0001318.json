In particular, the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound RuSr2 GdCu2 O8\nis examined on the coexistence of the superconductivity and the ferromagnetism, which has been\nobserved recently. We calculate critical fields of the superconductivity taking into account the FuldeFerrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in a model with Fermi-surfaces which shapes are similar to those\nobtained by a band calculation. It is shown that the critical field is enhanced remarkably due to\na Fermi-surface effect, and can be high enough to make the coexistence possible in a microscopic\nscale. We also clarify the direction of the spatial oscillation of the order parameter, which may be\nobserved by scanning tunneling microscope experiments.\n\n(0)\n\nRecently, coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been reported in the hybrid ruthenatecuprate compounds R1.4 Ce0.6 RuSr2 Cu2 O10\u2212\u03b4 (R = Eu\nand Gd) and RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 [1\u20133]. These compounds\nhave similar crystal structures to the high-Tc cuprate\nsuperconductor YBa2 Cu3 O7 except that layers of CuO\nchains are replaced with ruthenate layers. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the ruthenate\nlayers are responsible for the ferromagnetic long range\norder [3,4], while the cuprate layers for the superconductivity [3].\nOne of the remarkable features of these compounds is\nthat the superconducting transition occurs at a temperature well below the ferromagnetic transition temperature unlike most of the other ferromagnetic superconductors. For example, in RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 , the superconducting transition was observed at Tc \u223c 46K, whereas\nthe ferromagnetic transition at TM \u223c 132K [1]. Therefore, the ferromagnetic order can be regarded as a rigid\nback ground which is not modified very much by the appearance of the superconductivity. This picture is also\nsupported by experimental observations [1\u20133].\nAccording to the first principle calculations by Pickett\net al. [4], magnetic fields in the cuprate layers due to the\nordered spin moment in the ruthenate layers are much\nsmaller than exchange fields mediated by electrons. The\nexchange fields play a role like magnetic fields which act\nonly on the spin digrees of freedom but do not create\nLorentz force. Therefore, the present system is approximately equivalent to a quasi-two-dimensional system in\nmagnetic fields nearly parallel to the layers.\nHowever, such Fermi-surface splitting gives rise to pairbreaking effect as well as that due to a parallel magnetic field. The exchange field in RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 is very\nlarge and seems to exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limit\n(Chandrasekar-Clogston limit) [5]. The Pauli paramagnetic limit HP at T = 0 is roughly estimated from the\n(0)\nzero field transition temperature Tc by a simplified for(0)\nmula \u03bce HP = 1.25 Tc , where \u03bce denotes the electron\nmagnetic moment. For RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 , since the ex-\n\nchange field exists in practice, Tc of isolated cuprate\nlayers is not known, but it will be appropriate to as(0)\nsume Tc <\n\u223c 90K from the transition temperature of\nYBa2 Cu3 O7+\u03b4 at the optimum electron density. Hence\nwe obtain \u03bce HP <\n\u223c 110K at T = 0 from the above formula. On the other hand, the band calculation gives an\nestimation \u03bce Bex = \u2206ex /2 \u223c 25meV/2 \u223c 107K [4]. It is\nremarkable that the superconducting transition occurs at\nsuch a high temperature Tc \u2248 46K in spite of the strong\nexchange field of the order of the Pauli paramagnetic\nlimit at T = 0.\nThere are some mechanisms by which the critical field\nof superconductivity exceeds the Pauli limit. For example, the triplet pairing superconductivity is an important candidate. However, from their crystal structures\nand high transition temperatures, it is plausible that the\npresent compounds are categorized as high-Tc cuprate superconductors and therefore the superconductivity is due\nto an anisotropic singlet pairing with line nodes, which\nis conventionally called a d-wave pairing. For the singlet\npairing, possibility of an inhomogeneous superconducting\nstate that is called a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO or LOFF) state [6,7] was discussed by Pickett et\nal. [4] as a candidate for the mechanism.\nOn the possibility of the FFLO state, they pointed\nout that there are nearly flat areas in the Fermi-surfaces\nin RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 , which favor the FFLO state. It is\nknown that the FFLO critical field diverges at T = 0 in\none dimensional models. However, if the Fermi-surfaces\nare too flat, nesting instabilities, such as those to spin\ndensity wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW),\nare favored for realistic interaction strengths. For the\npresent compound, the nearly flat areas are not so flat\nthat the nesting instabilities occur, but the small curvature still enhances the FFLO state [8].\nIt is also known that even in the absence of the flat areas, the critical field is enhanced in the two-dimensional\n(2D) systems in comparison to the three dimensional systems [9,8,10,11]. Further, when the Fermi-surface structure of the system satisfies a certain condition, the critical\nfield can reach several times the Pauli limit even in the\n1\n\n\fabsence of nearly flat areas [12]. Such a Fermi-surface effect can be regarded as a kind of nesting effects analogous\nto those for SDW and CDW [8]. The \"nesting\" effect\nwas examined in details in our previous papers, where\n2D tight binding models are studied as examples [11,12].\nDirect evidence of the FFLO state may be obtained by\nscanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiments. For\na comparison with experimental results, spatial structure\nof the order parameter should be predicted theoretically.\nIn particular, direction of the modulation of the order\nparameter is important. It may appear that the modulation must be in the direction perpendicular to the flattest\narea of the Fermi-surface, because then the spatial variation is minimized. However, in some of 2D models, it is\nnot perpendicular to flattest areas [11,12]. Only explicite\ncalculations which take into account the Fermi-surface\nstructure could clarify the direction of the modulation.\nTherefore, the purposes of this paper are (1) estimation of the critical field of superconductivity including\nthe FFLO state to examine the possibility of coexistence\nof singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetism in a microscopic scale, and (2) clarification of the direction of\nthe spatial oscillation of the order parameter to compare\nwith results of STM experiments possible in the future.\nWe examine a tight binding model with Fermi-surfaces\nwhich shapes are similar to those of RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 , because the quantities that we are calculating are sensitive\nto the Fermi-surface structure.\nRecently, the FFLO state has been studied in a\ntight binding model with only nearest neighbor hopping [12,13]. It was found that ratio of the FFLO critical\nfield and the Pauli limit is small near the half filling. Zhu\net al. have discussed that hence the coexistence of the\nsuperconductivity and the ferromagnetic order is difficult except in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic domains\nnear the half filling [13,14]. However, some experimental results indicate coexistence in a microscopic scale and\na bulk Meissner-state [1,15]. Here, we should note that\nthe tight binding model with only nearest neighbor hopping can not reproduce the shapes of the Fermi-surfaces\nof RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 . By taking into account the realistic\nFermi-surface structure, we will show below that the critical field is enhanced remarkably and thus the coexistence\nin a microscopic scale is possible in this compound.\nFirst, we define the tight binding model\nX\nH0 =\n\u01ebp\u03c3 c\u2020p\u03c3 cp\u03c3\n(1)\n\nsurfaces similar to the symmetric CuO2 barrel Fermisurfaces obtained by Pickett et al.

Here, pk denotes\nthe momentum component along the Fermi-surface. The\npairing interaction is assumed to have a form\nV (p, p\u2032 ) = \u2212g\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302)\u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302\u2032 ).\n\n(5)\n\nIn particular, for d-wave pairing, we use a model with\n\u03b3d (p\u0302) \u221d cos px \u2212 cos py ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere px and py are the momentum components on\nthe Fermi-surface in the directions of p\u0302. In our previous papers, it was shown that the qualitative and semiquantitative results are not sensitive to details of the form\nof \u03b3d (p\u0302) [11,12]. An effective density of states N\u03b1 (0) for\nanisotropic pairing is defined by\n\np\u03c3\n\nwith a dispersion relation\n\u01ebp\u03c3 = \u22122t(cos px +cos py )\u22124t2 cos px cos py \u2212\u03bc+h\u03c3, (2)\nwhere h denotes the exchange field. When we apply the\npresent theory to type II superconductors in a magnetic\nfield B, h is written as h = \u03bce |B|.

However, regarding the critical field and the optimum direction of the\noscillation of the order parameter near the critical field,\nit is sufficient to take a single q as in eq.(3).\nFigures 2 and 3 show numerical results of the critical\nfields for t2 = \u22120.6, with our previous results for t2 = 0\n(dotted lines) [12]. It is found that the critical fields are\nremarkably enhanced near the electron densities n \u2248 1.46\nand 1.20 for the s-wave and the d-wave pairing, respectively. For example, at the electron density n = 1.1, the\nratios of the critical field to the Pauli paramagnetic limit\nare approximately equal to 1.66 and 3.19 for the s-wave\nand the d-wave pairing, respectively. These values (especially the latter) seem to be large enough to make the\ncoexistence possible in RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 .\nIn Fig.3 for the d-wave pairing, both the critical fields\nfor \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 and \u03c6q = 0 are shown, but the highest one\nis the final result of the critical field given by eq.(4). Here,\n\u03c6q is the angle between the optimum q and one of the\ncrystal axes. It is shown by a numerical calculation that\nthe critical fields for the other values of \u03c6q are lower than\nthe higher one of the critical fields for \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 and 0.\nThus, the direction of the optimum wave vector q jumps\nfrom \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 to \u03c6q = 0 at n \u2248 1.63. On the other hand,\nfor the s-wave pairing, \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 is the optimum in the\nwhole region of the electron density. These behaviors are\ndifferent from that for t2 = 0, in which \u03c6q = 0 [12].\nFor t2 = \u22120.6, a cusp is seen in Fig.2 for the s-wave\npairing, whereas it does not appear in Fig.3 for the dwave pairing. The physical origin of the cusp at n \u2248\n1.46 is that the Fermi surfaces satisfy a certain condition\nthere, which was explained in our previous paper for t2 =\n0 [12]. It is related to how the two Fermi-surfaces touch\nby the translation by the optimum q. In the present\ncase (t2 = \u22120.6 and n \u2248 1.46), the touch occurs in the\n(110) direction, but because of the nodes of the order\nparameter the \"nesting\" is not efficient for the d-wave\npairing. Therefore, cusp does not appear for the d-wave\npairing.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nn\nFIG. 2. Critical fields of the FFLO state of the s-wave\npairing for n = 0.92 \u223c 2 at T = 0.

Thin\nsolid line and thin dotted line show the Pauli paramagnetic\nlimits in the unit of \u2206d0 , for t2 = \u22120.6 and 0, respectively.\n\nIn spite of the absence of cusp behavior, the critical\nfield is still very large for the d-wave pairing near the\nhalf-filling. Figure 4 shows the nesting behavior of the\nFermi-surfaces at t2 = \u22120.6 and n = 1.1. The direction\nof the optimum vector q is \u03c6q = \u03c0/4, and the Fermisurfaces touch at two points (i.e., two lines in the px py pz space), (px , py ) \u2248 (1.113\u03c0, 1.713\u03c0) and (1.713\u03c0, 1.113\u03c0).\nSince \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 is also the direction of a node of the dwave order parameter, it may appear that this direction\nis less favorable. However, in actuality the critical field\n3\n\n\forder parameters of different symmetries, which increases\nT \u2217 [17].\nIn conclusion, the FFLO critical field of the cuprate\nlayers is remarkably enhanced by an effect of the Fermisurface structure. The direction of the spatial oscillation\nof the order parameter is in the (110) direction both for\nthe s-wave pairing and the d-wave pairing. Although we\nexamined only the ground state in this paper, the result\nHc /HP \u2248 3.19 at T = 0 is large enough to support coexistence of the superconductivity and the ferromagnetic\norder in a microscopic scale in RuSr2 GdCu2 O8 . Calculation for finite temperatures is now in progress.\nThis work was supported by a grant for Core Research\nfor Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) from\nJapan Science and Technology Corporation (JST).\n\nis remarkably enhanced for this \"nesting\" vector q, since\nit gives two nesting lines which are far away from the\nnodes but near the flattest areas, as shown in Fig.4. Besides, they are near both the maxima of the d-wave order\nparameter and the van Hove singularities, which also enhance the critical field. As the electron density increases,\nthe two nesting lines approach to the line node of the\norder parameter, and thus the critical field decreases.\n2\n\npy / \u03c0\n\n+\n\u2013\n\n1\n\n\u2013\n+\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n[1] C.

We use a large value of \u2206d0 = 0.3t/1.87\n(i.e., hc = 0.3t) in order to make the displacement visible.\n\nSince the optimum direction \u03c6q = \u03c0/4 is in a symmetry line, there are four equivalent directions, that is,\n\u03c6q = \u00b1\u03c0/4 and \u00b13\u03c0/4.
