INTRODUCTION\n\nTwo conspicuous aspects of gravitational lensing are the\nability to (i) produce multiple images, and (ii) magnify the apparent brightness of a distant background source. Large magnifications generally require that the projected density along\nthe line of sight be of order the critical surface density for\nlensing, which in turn implies a precise alignment of the observer, the lens, and the source. The same condition generally\nleads to the production of multiple images, so in most cases\none expects highly magnified objects to have at least one companion lensed image.\nThe connection between magnification and multiple imaging can be important in a variety of contexts. An important\nexample, which serves as the main motivation for this paper,\nis the recent discovery of bright quasars at redshifts as high as\nz \u223c 6 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; see Fan et al.\n2000, 2001, 2003). If these quasars are not lensed or beamed\n(see Haiman & Cen 2002 and Willott, McLure, & Jarvis 2003\nfor arguments to justify both assumptions), they are inferred\nto be very luminous (MB \u223c \u221227). Assuming further that they\nshine at the Eddington limit of their resident black holes (BH),\nthese BHs must have masses of several \u00d7109 M\u2299 .\nHaving such massive BHs at such an early stage in the evolution of the universe presents a challenge to models where\nmassive BHs grow mainly by gas accretion that is itself Ed1 Astronomy & Astrophysics Department, University of Chicago, 5640 S.\nEllis Ave., Chicago, IL 60637\n2 Hubble Fellow\n3 Department of Physics & Astronomy, Rutgers University, 136 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854\n4 Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of California,\n1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064\n5 Department of Astronomy, Columbia University, 550 W. 120th St., New\nYork, NY 10027\n\ndington limited (Haiman & Loeb 2001). Even in the context\nof hierarchical structure formation models, where mergers of\nseveral BHs can contribute to the build-up of the mass, the\ninitial seeds are required to be present as early as z & 15\n(Haiman & Loeb 2001). The problem is exacerbated if BH\u2013\nBH mergers result in the ejection of BHs from the shallow\ndark matter potential wells at high redshift because of a large\nrecoil following the emission of gravitational waves. In a\nrecent model that includes this effect, Haiman (2004) found\nthat BHs can grow by mergers and accretion to at most a few\n\u00d7108 M\u2299 by redshift z = 6.4 without a super-Eddington phase\n- a short-fall by a factor of \u223c 10 relative to the BH masses\ninferred from observations.\nIf the high-redshift quasars were magnified by gravitational\nlensing by a factor of \u03bc & 10, this could alleviate the need\nfor a super-Eddington growth phase to explain such massive\nearly BHs (since the inferred mass scales as \u03bc\u22121 under the\nassumption that the quasar is shining at the Eddington luminosity). Although the lensing optical depth along a random\nline of sight to z \u223c 6 is known to be small (\u223c 10\u22123 ; e.g.,\nKochanek 1998; Barkana & Loeb 2000), magnification bias\ncan significantly boost the probability of strong lensing in a\nreal, flux-limited survey. If the intrinsic (unlensed) quasar luminosity function at z \u223c 6 is steep, and/or it extends to faint\nmagnitudes, the probability of strong lensing for the SDSS\nquasars could even be of order unity (Comerford et al. 2002;\nWyithe & Loeb 2002). However, for a population of isothermal sphere lenses, all magnifications \u03bc > 2 are associated\nwith multiple imaging, and in most cases the angular separation between the images is more than 0.\u2032\u2032 3 (Comerford et al.\n2002). Recent HST observations of the highest redshift\nquasars have shown no evidence for additional images of\nany of the z \u2248 6 sources down to a splitting angle of 0.\u2032\u2032 3\n(Richards et al. 2004), which effectively rules out the hypoth-\n\n\f2\nesis that the quasars are all highly magnified by isothermal\nsphere lenses.\nThe obvious question is whether the SDSS quasars could\nbe magnified by lenses with a more complicated (and indeed more realistic) lens potential, without producing multiple detectable images. Wyithe & Loeb (2002) showed that\nmicrolensing by stars within lens galaxies can permit magnifications as high as \u03bc \u223c 10 for singly-imaged quasars, but\nthe probability for \u03bc > 2 is still very low (<0.5% even when\nmagnification bias is included). Another question is whether\ndepartures from spherical symmetry significantly affect the\nresults. One goal of this paper is to study ellipticity in the lens\ngalaxy and tidal shear from objects along the line of sight,\nboth of which are common in observed multiply-imaged systems (e.g., Keeton, Kochanek, & Seljak 1997; Witt & Mao\n1997; Holder & Schechter 2003). Ellipticity and shear are\nknown to modify the full magnification distribution for\nmultiply-imaged sources (e.g., Blandford & Kochanek 1987;\nFinch et al. 2002; Huterer et al. 2004); but what happens\nwhen we restrict attention to sources without multiple detectable images is not known. More generally, our goal is\nto present a thorough and general study of the magnifications\nthat can be produced by lenses with different radial profiles\nand angular shapes, without creating multiple detectable images. We simultaneously consider both true singly-imaged\nsystems, as well as multiply-imaged configurations where the\nimages are too close to be resolved or the extra images are\nbelow some reasonable detection threshold.\nIn this thorough but technical study, let us not lose sight of\nthe bottom line: We find that the maximum probability that\na z \u2248 6 quasar is magnified by at least a factor of 10 without\nhaving a second detectable image is 29% (see Table 1). Moreover, this maximum is reached only in the unlikely event that\nhalos down to arbitrarily low mass have highly concentrated\n(singular isothermal sphere) profiles. In more realistic models of the lensing population, where dwarf halos have flatter\n(NFW) inner profiles, the maximum probability is \u223c 10%.\nWhile our analysis is specifically prompted by the SDSS\nquasars, it should be applicable to other objects for which\nsignificant lensing amplification would be important, such as\nhigh-redshift galaxies discovered in \"blank\" fields6 (i.e., fields\nnot specifically chosen for the presence of a massive cluster lens;e.g., Rhoads et al. 2000; Rhoads & Malhotra 2001;\nSteidel et al. 2003; Bouwens et al. 2003; Ouchi et al. 2003;\nStanway et al. 2004; Pirzkal et al. 2004).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a7 2, we review\nthe relevant lens theory and summarize our calculation methods. In the technical core of the paper (\u00a7\u00a7 3-4), we study\nthe magnification properties of simple but useful lens potentials: ellipsoidal isothermal and NFW halos, with external\ntidal shear. The idea is to identify general features and understand the parameter dependences. Building on this foundation, in \u00a7 5 we compute the probability of magnification\nwithout multiple imaging for a realistic lens population, and\ndiscuss the implications for the SDSS quasars. Finally, in\n\u00a7 6 we summarize our results. Throughout the paper, we assume a \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03c38 = 0.9,\nand H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, consistent with the recent results from\nWMAP (Spergel et al. 2003).\n6\n\nMagnification of high-redshift sources by foreground cluster lenses is\ncertainly interesting and important (e.g., Hu et al. 2002; Kneib et al. 2004;\nPell\u00f3 et al. 2004). However, deliberate selection of cluster fields makes the\nprobability analysis completely different from what we study here.\n\n2. COMPUTATION METHODS\n\nThe lensing properties of a system can be derived from the\nlens potential \u03c6, which is given by the solution to the 2-d\nPoisson equation \u22072 \u03c6 = 2\u03ba. Here \u03ba = \u03a3/\u03a3crit is the surface mass density in units of the critical density for lensing, \u03a3crit = (c2 Dos )/(4\u03c0GDol Dls ), where Dol , Dos , and Dls are\nangular diameter distances between the observer, lens, and\nsource. (See Schneider, Ehlers, & Falco 1992 for a full discussion of lens theory.) The relation between the position x\nof an image and the position u of the corresponding source is\ngiven by the lens equation,\nu = x \u2212 \u2207\u03c6(x) .\n\n(1)\n\nThe magnification of an image at position x is\n2\n\n\u03bc(x) =\n\n2\n\n\u2202 \u03c6\n1 \u2212 \u2202\u2202x\u03c62 \u2212 \u2202x\u2202y\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2202 \u03c6\n\u2212 \u2202x\u2202y\n1 \u2212 \u2202\u2202y\u03c62\n\n\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nThe lensing critical curves are curves in the image plane\nwhere the magnification is formally infinite, and the caustics\nare the corresponding curves in the source plane. Sources that\nlie outside the caustics are singly imaged, while sources inside the caustics have multiple images. We use the gravlens\nsoftware by Keeton (2001a) to find the caustics, solve the lens\nequation, and compute the image magnifications for the various models we consider.\nWe are interested in the cross section for having a magnification (of a single image, or a combination of unresolved\nimages) larger than \u03bc, which we compute with Monte Carlo\nsimulations. For singly-imaged sources, we set a minimum\nmagnification \u03bcmin of interest, typically \u03bcmin = 1.5, and find\nthe smallest circle in the image plane such that all images\noutside the circle have \u03bc < \u03bcmin ; this ensures that all of the\nimages of interest lie inside the circle. We then pick \u223c 106\nrandom image positions in the circle. The cross section for\nproducing a singly-imaged system with magnification greater\nthan \u03bc can be written as\nZ\nZ\n1\ndx .\n(3)\nAsing (\u03bc) =\ndu =\n\u03bc(x)\n\u03bc(u)>\u03bc\n\u03bc(x)>\u03bc\nThe first integral is over all source positions u where there is\nonly one image and it has magnification greater than \u03bc. The\nsecond integral is over the corresponding image positions, and\nthe equality holds because \u03bc\u22121 = |\u2202u/\u2202x| is the Jacobian of\nthe transformation between the image and source planes. In\nother words, the cumulative singly-imaged magnification distribution can be computed by simply summing the images,\nweighted by their inverse magnifications.\nFor multiply-imaged sources, we find the smallest circle enclosing the caustics, then pick \u223c 106 random sources in this\ncircle and solve the lens equation to find the image configurations. Now we throw away the singly-imaged systems, and\nuse the multiply-imaged systems to compute the cross section for having a magnification greater than \u03bc but no extra\ndetectable images,\nZ\nS(u) du .\n(4)\nAmult (\u03bc) =\n\u03bc(u)>\u03bc\n\nThis integral spans the multiply-imaged region, but the function S(u) selects source positions that produce lenses with\nonly a single detectable image; specifically, S(u) is 1 if the\nadditional images are undetectable (either because they are\n\n\f3\ntoo faint, or too close to the brightest image), and 0 otherwise. In general, S(u) will depend on the specific source, instrument, and observational conditions. Hereafter we refer\nto it as the \"single-detectable-image criterion\" (SDIC). In recent HST images of the z \u2248 6 SDSS quasars, Richards et al.\n(2004) were able to rule out the presence of extra images with\na flux ratio relative to the quasar of f > 0.01 down to a separation \u2206\u03b8 > 0.\u2032\u2032 3, or brighter than f > 0.1 down to \u2206\u03b8 > 0.\u2032\u2032 1.\nWe consider both of these SDICs in our analysis. In configurations where there are multiple images that would not be\nresolved, we include all of them in the net magnification.\n3. ISOTHERMAL HALOS\n\nThe isothermal ellipsoid is a simple but surprisingly useful\nmodel for studying lensing by galaxies. In this section we\ndelineate the situations in which isothermal halos can produce\nmagnification without detectable multiple images.\n3.1. Definitions of Ellipticity and Shear\nEarly-type galaxies, which dominate the lensing optical depth at image separations \u2206\u03b8 . 4\u2032\u2032 , appear to have\nnearly-isothermal profiles based on evidence from strong and\nweak lensing, stellar dynamics, satellite kinematics, and Xray studies (e.g., Fabbiano 1989; Zaritsky & White 1994;\nRix et al. 1997; Gerhard et al. 2001; McKay et al. 2002;\nTreu & Koopmans 2002; Koopmans et al. 2003; Rusin et al.\n2003b; Sheldon et al. 2004). The 3-d density \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 and projected surface mass density \u03ba \u221d R\u22121 correspond to a flat rotation curve or velocity dispersion profile, and a deflection angle\nthat is independent of impact parameter.\nThe lensing properties of a singular isothermal sphere are\nvery simple (e.g., Schneider et al. 1992). The surface mass\ndensity is \u03ba = Rein /(2R) where Rein is the Einstein radius, and\nthe lensing potential is \u03c6 = Rein R. A source at radius u > Rein\nbehind the lens produces a single image at radius R = Rein + u\nwhich has magnification \u03bc = R/(R \u2212 Rein ) = 1 + Rein /u. A\nsource at radius u < Rein produces two images at radii R\u00b1 =\nRein \u00b1 u on opposite sides of the lens galaxy, which have magnifications \u03bc\u00b1 = R\u00b1 /(R\u00b1 \u2212Rein ) = 1\u00b1Rein /u (where a negative\nmagnification means that the image is parity reversed).\nAn isothermal ellipsoid has a projected surface mass density of\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n1 + q2\nb\n,\n(5)\n\u03ba(R, \u03b8) =\n2R (1 + q2) \u2212 (1 \u2212 q2) cos2\u03b8\n\nwhere q \u2264 1 is the axis ratio, so the ellipticity is e = 1 \u2212 q,\nand (R, \u03b8) are polar coordinates centered on the lens galaxy.\n(Without loss of generality, we are working in coordinates\naligned with the major axis of the galaxy.) The lensing properties of an isothermal ellipsoid are given by Kassiola & Kovner\n(1993), Kormann, Schneider, & Bartelmann (1994), and\nKeeton & Kochanek (1998). For a spherical galaxy the parameter b equals the Einstein radius, while for a nonspherical\ngalaxy we can relate them by (see Huterer et al. 2004)\n\u00031/2\n\u0001\nRein 1 \u0002\n2(1 + q\u22122)\n(6)\nK 1 + q\u22122 ,\n=\nb\n\u03c0\nwhere K(x) is the elliptic integral of the first kind.\nGravitational tidal shear, produced by objects near the\nmain lens halo or projected along the line of sight, can\nincrease the probability for high magnifications. Shear\nis expected to be common, based on both analytic estimates and numerical simulations (e.g., Keeton et al. 1997;\n\nF IG . 1.- Source plane for an isothermal ellipsoid with ellipticity e = 0.5\nand Einstein radius Rein = 1.\u2032\u2032 0. The curves show the caustics. The small\n(large) points outside the caustics indicate singly-imaged sources with magnification \u03bc > 3 (\u03bc > 5). The points inside the caustic show multiply-imaged\nsources for which extra images are undetectable; the small (large) points denote a flux ratio threshold f < 0.1 ( f < 0.01). The inset shows a close-up of\nthe tip of the inner caustic.\n\nHolder & Schechter 2003), and it is generally required for fitting observed galaxy-mass (M \u223c 1012 M\u2299 ) strong lens systems (e.g., Keeton et al. 1997; Witt & Mao 1997). The lens\npotential associated with shear is\n1\n(7)\n\u03c6(R, \u03b8) = \u2212 R2 \u03b3 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3 ) ,\n2\nwhere \u03b3 is the dimensionless shear amplitude, \u03b8\u03b3 is the shear\ndirection. Shears of \u03b3 \u223c 0.05\u20130.1 are common for galaxymass lenses, and shears of \u03b3 \u223c 0.2\u20130.3 are possible for lens\ngalaxies lying in dense environments (e.g., Keeton et al. 1997;\nWitt & Mao 1997; Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997a,b; Fischer et al. 1998;\nKneib et al. 2000; Holder & Schechter 2003).\n3.2. Parameter Dependences for a Single Lens\n\nTo begin to understand isothermal lenses, we show the\nsource plane for a sample lens with ellipticity e = 0.5 in Figure 1. Singly-imaged sources with magnification \u03bc > 3 occur\nonly in a region just outside the caustics and near the minor\naxis of the radial caustic (which corresponds to the major axis\nof the galaxy density distribution). In this example with Einstein radius Rein = 1\u2032\u2032 , the image separations are larger than\nHST resolution, so the only systems that have only one detectable image are those whose extra images are too faint.\nMost of these are small flux ratio doubles, corresponding to\nsources that lie in two regions: just inside the outer radial\ncaustic, where the secondary image is very faint; or near the\ninner tangential caustic, especially near the cusps along the\nmajor axis, where the primary image is highly magnified. In\nthis example the two regions merge together when the flux\nratio threshold for missing the second image is f < 0.1 (the\nsmall points in Figure 1), but remain distinct when the threshold is f < 0.01 (the large points).\nWe see that for isothermal galaxies with e = 0.5, the cross\nsection for magnified systems with undetectable extra images appears to be larger than the cross section for magnified\n\n\f4\n3.2.2. Multiply-imaged magnification distributions\n\nF IG . 2.- Maximum singly-imaged magnification for an isothermal sphere\nwith shear (upper panel) and for an isothermal ellipsoid (lower panel). The\nmaximum magnification becomes infinite at \u03b3 = 1/3 or e = 0.606 (see the\nAppendix for details).\n\nsingly-imaged systems. In the next two subsections we quantify this result carefully by computing the magnification cross\nsections for both cases.\n3.2.1. Singly-imaged magnification distributions\n\nFor most isothermal lenses (unless the ellipticity or shear\nis large), there is a finite upper bound on the singly-imaged\nmagnification. The bound is derived in the Appendix, and\nshown in Figure 2. While spherical models can never produce a singly-imaged magnification larger than \u03bcmax = 2 (in\nthe absence of microlensing; see Wyithe & Loeb 2002), nonspherical models can in principle produce much larger magnifications. However, the effect is not likely to be very dramatic\nin practice: for a typical shear \u03b3 \u223c 0.1 or ellipticity e \u223c 0.3,\n\u03bcmax is still less than 3.\nThe full magnification cross sections are shown in Figure 3\nfor various values of the parameters. Since all of the physical parameters - the lens galaxy mass and redshift, and the\nsource redshift - are contained in the Einstein radius, the\ndimensionless cross section A(\u03bc)/R2ein depends only on ellipticity and shear so the parameter space we must study is small.\nPanels (a) and (b) show that shear and ellipticity increase not\njust \u03bcmax but the whole high-magnification tail. However, the\ncross section for high magnifications is small; even in models\nwith large shear or ellipticity, the area in the source plane with\n\u03bc > 10 is less than 0.1% of the area with \u03bc > 1.5.\nShear and ellipticity are not mutually exclusive, so panel (c)\nshows what happens when we include both; we fix the amplitudes to typical values \u03b3 = 0.1 and e = 0.3 and vary the angle\nbetween them. The effects are largest when the shear and\nellipticity are aligned, because they combine to increase the\nquadrupole moment of the lens potential; and the effects are\nsmallest when they are orthogonal because their quadrupoles\npartially cancel. When averaged over angle, we expect the\ncombination of shear and ellipticity to produce a modest increase in the area with modest magnifications.\n\nSample multiply-imaged magnification distributions are\nshown in Figure 4. There are various unusual features\nthat can be understood with the help of the corresponding source plane shown in Figure 1. Without imposing\nany single-detectable-image criterion (SDIC), the magnification cross section shows a kink at the minimum magnification for quads, and the high-magnification systems are\ndominated by quads (see, e.g., Blandford & Kochanek 1987;\nSchneider et al. 1992; Finch et al. 2002). SDICs remove the\nvast majority of quads, however, because the extra images in\nquads tend to be fairly bright. The only quad sources that survive the cut lie extremely close to the caustic, with image configurations dominated by a very bright and very close pair of\nimages. In this example, when the flux ratio SDIC is f < 0.1\nthe magnification distribution is a smooth curve. However,\nwhen the flux ratio SDIC is f < 0.01 the distribution breaks\nup into two separate populations, with the low-magnification\npopulation lying just inside the radial caustic, while the highmagnification population lies just outside the cusps of the tangential caustic (see Figure 1). (The image separation SDIC is\nunimportant here because the Einstein radius is larger than the\nHST resolution.)\nHaving understood the general features, we can now examine how the multiply-imaged magnification distribution depends on ellipticity, as shown in Figure 5. In the absence of\nSDICs, ellipticity raises the high-magnification tail; for example, the cross section for \u03bc > 10 is increased by a factor\nof \u223c2 for e & 0.5. This case will apply to low-mass halos\nwhere the Einstein radius is small enough that all image separations are unresolvable. When the flux ratio SDIC is important (when the halo mass is large enough that the image\nseparations would be resolved), ellipticity has a much more\ndramatic effect. In the spherical case there are no magnifications \u03bc > 2/(1 \u2212 f ), where f is from the SDIC. Introducing\nellipticity creates a population of high-magnification sources\nlying just outside the cusps of the tangential caustic. As e\nincreases, that population grows and merges with the population of lower-magnification sources lying inside the radial\ncaustic (as in Figure 4b). Finally, as the ellipticity grows\nto e > 0.606 the cusp of the tangential caustic pierces the\nradial caustic, so the high-magnification region just outside\nthe cusp becomes associated with singly-imaged rather than\nmultiply-imaged systems. This explains why the multiplyimaged cross section curve changes shape, but it is not very\nimportant in practice because such large ellipticities are rare.\nThe details clearly depend on the ellipticity and the SDIC,\nbut the most important result is more general: the ordering\nof the curves in Figure 5. The dominant source of magnifications \u03bc & 5 should be unresolvable small-separation lenses\nproduced by low-mass halos, followed by systems with multiple images where the extra images are too faint to be detected. The contribution from true singly-imaged systems is\ngenerally not as important, except when the ellipticity is large\n(e & 0.6), and even then the cross section is quite small.\nShear has similar effects on the magnification cross sections, because like ellipticity it increases the quadrupole moment of the lens potential and makes the tangential caustic\nlarger. We do not show the cross sections for different shears,\nbecause the results appear very similar to those displayed in\nFigure 5.\n3.3. Averaging over Ellipticity and Shear\n\n\f5\n\nF IG . 3.- Singly-imaged magnification distributions for isothermal models.

For reference, the dashed curve shows a model with e = 0.3 and no shear, while the dotted curve shows a model with \u03b3 = 0.1 and\nno ellipticity.\n\nF IG . 4.- Multiply-imaged magnification distributions for an isothermal ellipsoid with ellipticity e = 0.5. The different line types denote different image\nconfigurations (doubles, quads, or all lenses). The different panels show different criteria for having only a single detectable image; panels (b) and (c) correspond\nto the detection limits in HST observations of the z \u2248 6 SDSS quasars by Richards et al. (2004).\n\nIn order to obtain the overall probability distribution for the\nmagnification, we next average over realistic distributions of\nellipticity and shear. For the distribution of shear amplitudes,\nwe use the model derived by Holder & Schechter (2003) for\nthe environments of early-type galaxies in N-body and semianalytic models of galaxy formation; they find a lognormal\ndistribution with median \u03b3 = 0.05 and dispersion \u03c3\u03b3 = 0.2 dex.\nWe use random shear directions. For the ellipticity distribution, we use data on the shapes of observed early-type galaxies.7 J\u00f8rgensen, Franx, & Kjaergaard (1995) give ellipticities\nfor 379 E and S0 galaxies in 11 clusters, including Coma.\nThe distribution is broad, with mean \u0113 = 0.31 and dispersion\n\u03c3e = 0.18. We average over more than 1000 random combinations of ellipticity and shear.\nFigure 6 shows the resulting cross sections. Singly-imaged\nsystems are important only for low magnifications (\u03bc . 2).\nIf the Einstein radius is small and the lenses are unresolved,\n7 The data give the shape of the light distribution, while what we need\nis the shape of the mass distribution. The mass and light shapes may not\nbe correlated on a case-by-case basis, but for our purposes it is sufficient to\nassume that their distributions are similar (see Rusin & Tegmark 2001).\n\nthen multiply-imaged systems dominate at \u03bc & 1.8; much of\nthe relevant cross section comes from quads (as indicated by\nthe difference between the solid and dashed curves). When\nthe flux ratio SDIC applies, multiply-imaged systems dominate at \u03bc & 2.5 for a SDIC of f < 0.1; for \u03bc . 10 most of\nthis cross section comes from doubles, while for higher magnifications there is a significant contribution from quads. For\na flux ratio SDIC f < 0.01, multiply-imaged systems dominate at \u03bc & 10, and most of the cross section comes from\ndoubles. The overall conclusion is that for isothermal halos,\nmost large magnifications \u03bc & 10 will correspond to multiplyimaged systems where the extra image are not detectable (either unresolved or faint).\nWe have explicitly examined ellipticity and shear, but\nearly-type galaxies are also observed to have small octopole moments in their light distributions. We have repeated our analysis using the ellipticity and octopole distributions from the galaxy samples of Bender et al. (1989) and\nSaglia, Bender, & Dressler (1993), and confirmed that our results are not very sensitive to changes in the ellipticity distribution or to the addition of octopole terms.\n\n\f6\n\nF IG . 5.- Effects of ellipticity on multiply-imaged magnification distributions for isothermal models.

For comparison, the dotted curve shows the appropriate singly-imaged magnification distribution (see Figure 3).\n\nF IG . 6.- Magnification cross sections after averaging over ellipticity and\nshear.

The middle pair corresponds to the following criteria for\nhaving a single detectable image: \u2206\u03b8 < 0.1 Rein or f < 0.1; while the bottom\npair corresponds the criteria \u2206\u03b8 < 0.3 Rein or f < 0.01.\n\n4. NFW HALOS\n\nAnother common and useful lens model is the NavarroFrenk-White (NFW) profile, which describes halos produced\nin N-body simulations. The NFW profile is thought to describe systems that are dominated by dark matter at all radii:\nmassive cluster halos, and perhaps low-mass dwarf halos as\nwell. In this section we study the ability of NFW lenses to\nproduce magnification without detectable multiple images.\n4.1. Definitions\nThe NFW profile has the form\n\u03c1s\n,\n\u03c1(r) =\n(r/rs )(1 + r/rs)2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere rs is a scale radius and \u03c1s is a characteristic density. There has been debate about whether the inner density profile of simulated clusters really asymptotes to the\n\u03c1 \u221d r\u22121 form (e.g., Navarro et al. 1997; Fukushige & Makino\n1997; Moore et al. 1999; Jing & Suto 2000; Power et al.\n2003; Fukushige et al. 2004), and whether such a density\ncusp is consistent with observed clusters (e.g., Tyson et al.\n1998; Smith et al. 2001; Ettori et al. 2002; Kelson et al. 2002;\nSand et al. 2002; Lewis et al. 2003; Sand et al. 2004). Our\nmain need is for a model other than the isothermal ellipsoid\nthat we can apply to massive clusters and low-mass dwarf halos. For this purpose the NFW model is standard and sufficient, and exploring a larger family of models (such as generalized NFW) is beyond the scope of this paper. Besides, with\nappropriate normalizations generalized NFW profiles lead to\nlens statistics that are not so sensitive to the inner profile slope\n(Keeton & Madau 2001).\nThe NFW profile has projected surface mass density\n(Bartelmann 1996)\n\u03ba(R) = 2 \u03bas\n\n1 \u2212 F(R/rs )\n,\n(R/rs )2 \u2212 1\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bas \u2261 \u03c1s rs /\u03a3crit is a dimensionless lensing \"strength\"\nparameter, and the function F(x) is:\n(\n(1 \u2212 x2)\u22121/2 tanh\u22121 (1 \u2212 x2 )1/2 x < 1\nF(x) = 1\n(10)\nx=1\n(x2 \u2212 1)\u22121/2 tan\u22121 (x2 \u2212 1)1/2\nx>1\nWe obtain an elliptical NFW model by replacing R \u2192 (x2 +\ny2 /q2 )1/2 in the surface mass density, where q \u2264 1 is the projected axis ratio, and the ellipticity is e = 1 \u2212 q. The lensing properties of an elliptical NFW model can be computed\nwith a set of 1-d numerical integrals (Schramm 1990; Keeton\n2001b).8\n8\n\nIt is possible to obtain an analytic NFW model by putting the ellipti-\n\n\f7\ntems will be more important than multiply-imaged systems\nfor producing large magnifications with a single detectable\nimage. In the next two subsections we quantify this result\ncarefully.\n4.2.1. Singly-imaged magnification distributions\n\nF IG . 7.- Sample lensing strength \u03bas (upper panel) and halo scale radius\nrs (lower panel) versus halo mass, for a lens at redshift zl = 1 and source\nat redshift zs = 6. The solid curves show results for halos with the median\nconcentration, using the median c(M) relation from Bullock et al. (2001); the\ndotted curves indicate the 1\u03c3 range due to the scatter in the M-c correlation,\n\u03c3c = 0.14 dex at fixed mass.\n\nNFW profiles appear to form a two-parameter family specified by \u03c1s and rs , or equivalently by the virial mass M and a\nconcentration parameter c = rvir /rs . (The virial radius rvir can\nbe given as an explicit function of M and c.) In fact, the two\nparameters are correlated, and different models for median\nrelation and scatter have been proposed (e.g., Navarro et al.\n1997; Eke et al. 2001; Bullock et al. 2001; Jing & Suto 2002).\nFor our purposes, the important result is that the scale length\nrs and lensing strength \u03bas are both correlated with the halo\nmass, as shown in Figure 7. In this section we can express\ncross sections in units of rs2 so we need not examine the rs\ndependence explicitly; but we do need to examine the dependence on \u03bas .\n4.2. Parameter Dependences for a Single Lens\n\nTo begin to understand NFW lenses, in Figure 8 we show\nthe source plane for a sample lens with strength \u03bas = 0.168\n(corresponding to a median 1014 M\u2299 halo at zl = 1, see Figure 7) and ellipticity e = 0.1. The caustics are small, and\nthe region of multiply-imaged systems that satisfy reasonable single-detectable-image criteria (SDIC) is smaller still.\nThe reason is that the image separations for massive halos are\nlarge, so the important SDICs involve the flux ratios. NFW\nhalos generally produce large magnifications, and the range\nof magnification ratios is not very broad. As a result, the\nonly sources that survive the SDICs lie very near the caustics,\nwhere one of the images has a very large magnification.\nBy contrast, there is quite a large region of the source plane\nwhere sources are singly-imaged but have large magnifications. Thus, for NFW halos it appears that singly-imaged syscal symmetry in the potential rather than the density (e.g., Golse & Kneib\n2002; Meneghetti, Bartelmann, & Moscardini 2003). However, N-body simulations suggest that it is the density rather than the potential that has ellipsoidal symmetry (or more generally, triaxiality; e.g., Jing & Suto 2002). We\nfind that working with an elliptical density and using numerical integrals is\nnot a major hindrance.\n\nEven spherical NFW lenses are complex systems where the\nlens equation is transcendental, so they must be studied numerically. Figure 9 shows the maximum singly-imaged magnification as a function of the strength \u03bas . Spherical NFW halos can apparently produce large magnifications without multiple imaging, especially when the lensing strength (or halo\nmass) is small. It has been known that for multiple imaging at\nfixed splitting angle NFW lenses tend to produce smaller cross\nsections but larger magnifications than isothermal lenses (see\nBlandford & Kochanek 1987; Knudson et al. 2001). Now we\nsee that the association between NFW lenses and high magnifications extends to single imaging as well.\nThe full magnification distributions are shown in Figure 10. Panel (a) shows that for spherical halos, increasing\nthe strength \u03bas decreases \u03bcmax but increases the overall cross\nsection. Note that the figure shows the cross section in units of\nrs2 ; expressing the area in physical units like steradians would\nincrease the distance between the curves, since the strength is\ncorrelated with rs (see Figure 7).\nPanels (b) and (c) in Figure 10 show that shear and ellipticity do not dramatically affect the magnification distributions\nfor NFW halos. This stands in contrast to the case for isothermal halos. The difference is that the magnification distribution for spherical NFW halos already extends to high magnifications, so any increase due to ellipticity or shear is relatively\nmore moderate. The departure from spherical symmetry does\nraise the tail to very high magnifications, but that effect is\nnot very sensitive to the degree of asymmetry (shear or ellipticity). Interestingly, ellipticity appears to lower slightly the\ncross section for moderate magnifications. Finally, Figure 10d\nshows that allowing a combination of ellipticity and shear has\nlittle effect other than extending the high-\u03bc tail of the distribution. While this is shown explicitly only for fixed e = 0.3\nand \u03b3 = 0.1, we expect this generic feature to hold for other\ncombinations.\n4.2.2. Multiply-imaged magnification distributions\n\nFigure 11 shows sample multiply-imaged magnification\ndistributions for spherical NFW halos with different values\nof the lensing strength \u03bas . Only the case with no regard for\nthe number of detectable images is shown, because as we saw\nin Figure 8 the cross section for NFW lenses that satisfy the\nflux SDICs is extremely small. When the strength is low, the\ncumulative cross section A(\u03bc) is flat out to \u03bc > 100, indicating that all magnifications are larger than 100; however, the\ncross section is very small. As \u03bas increases, the point at which\nA(\u03bc) begins to decline moves to the left, indicating that the\nminimum magnification decreases; and the cross section increases. For all but the most massive and concentrated halos,\nthe multiply-imaged magnification cross section is considerably smaller than the singly-imaged cross section, except at\nthe very highest (and rarest) magnifications.\nA better way to compare the singly- and multiply-imaged\ncases is to take the ratio of the cross sections, as shown in Figure 12. Decreasing \u03bas increases the ratio dramatically, so for\nmoderate- to low-mass NFW halos the singly-imaged magnification cross section can be orders of magnitude larger than\n\n\f8\n\nF IG . 8.- Source plane for an NFW halo with strength \u03bas = 0.168, scale radius rs = 167 h\u22121 kpc = 29.\u2032\u2032 8, and ellipticity e = 0.1.

A REALISTIC HALO POPULATION\n\nHaving understood two fiducial halo models, we now combine them into a realistic population of galaxies and clusters.\nWe compute the overall probability for magnification with additional detectable images, and use it to evaluate the hypothesis that the four z \u2248 6 SDSS quasars are highly amplified by\nlensing. After defining the model (\u00a7 5.1), we present our general results (\u00a7 5.2) and then apply them to the SDSS quasars\n(\u00a7 5.3). We end with a discussion of some systematic effects\nin our analysis (\u00a7 5.4).\n5.1.

This quantifies the statement that for magnification by NFW halos, singly-imaged\nsystems are vastly more important than multiply-imaged systems.\nFigure 13 shows that ellipticity has little effect on the\nmultiply-imaged magnification distribution. Large shears can\nin principle increase the cross section. However, it is not\nclear that massive NFW halos could experience such large\nshears. Shears of \u03b3 \u223c 0.2\u20130.3 typically occur when the lens\nis a galaxy within a clusters, where the cluster serves as the\nenvironment that produces the shear. The filamentary structure typical around clusters represents a very different environment, for which the shear distribution is not well known.\nFortunately, this uncertainty is not important for our results\nbecause shear and ellipticity have such modest effects.

The most massive halos, corresponding to clusters and\ngroups of galaxies, are treated as NFW halos; while halos corresponding to galaxies are modeled with isothermal profiles.\nIn this increasingly standard model (Flores & Primack 1996;\n\nKeeton 1998; Porciani & Madau 2000; Kochanek & White\n2001; Li & Ostriker 2002), the difference between clusters\nand galaxies is usually attributed to baryonic cooling: in massive halos the baryons have not had time to cool so the systems\nretain their initial NFW form; while in lower-mass halos the\ngas has cooled and condensed into the center of the system,\nand created a more concentrated total (baryons + dark matter)\nmass profile (e.g., Blumenthal et al. 1986; Kochanek & White\n2001). Thus, the transition between clusters and galaxies\nis characterized by a mass scale Mclus such that halos with\nM < Mclus (M > Mclus ) have a cooling time shorter (longer)\nthan the age of the universe and correspond to galaxies (clusters).\nThere may be a third population as well, namely lowmass \"dwarf\" halos with NFW profiles. Theoretical halo\nmass functions rise much more steeply than observed galaxy\nluminosity functions, leading to the speculation that there\nmay be a substantial population of underluminous lowmass halos. Mechanisms such as feedback or reionization\nmight have suppressed baryonic cooling and star formation\nin low-mass systems (e.g., Dekel & Silk 1986; Efstathiou\n1992; Navarro & Steinmetz 1997; Thoul & Weinberg 1996;\nBullock et al. 2000; Springel & Hernquist 2003), leading to\nhalos that are dark and retain their initial NFW form. The apparent dearth of small-separation lens systems implies a transition from isothermal galaxies back to NFW dwarfs around\n\n\f10\n\nF IG . 13.- Magnification distributions for NFW halos with different ellipticities (upper panel) and shears (lower panel), with no regard for the number of\ndetectable images.

However, there\nis a degeneracy between \u03c3clus and Mclus such that a model\nwith a sharp transition (\u03c3clus = 0) and log Mclus = 13.38 fits\nalmost as well. We have verified that the two models give\nindistinguishable results, so we report results only for the\nmodel with a sharp transition. The cluster/galaxy transition\nmass inferred from lensing agrees well with estimates based\non cooling arguments (e.g., Kochanek & White 2001). As\nfor the galaxy/dwarf transition, current data lack any ability\nto determine whether it is smooth or sharp, so for simplicity we use only a sharp transition. The formal best-fit model\nhas log Mdwarf = 12.5, although in fact only an upper limit on\nMdwarf is reliable (see Kuhlen et al. 2004). This mass is too\nKuhlen et al. (2004) because we now use the Sheth & Tormen (1999) mass\nfunction rather than that from Jenkins et al. (2001), and we use \u03c38 = 0.90\nrather than \u03c38 = 0.74.\n\n\f11\nhigh to be explained by reionization feedback, so it might indicate either some other kind of feedback or some peculiarities in the data (perhaps unknown incompletenesses at small\nseparations, or simply small-number statistics). We therefore\nconsider several different values for Mdwarf . We take the transition masses Mclus and Mdwarf to be independent of redshift.\nThis assumption may seem objectionable, but we show below\nthat the specific value of Mclus has little effect on our results,\nand we explicitly consider systematic uncertainties associated\nwith Mdwarf .\n5.2. Main Results\n\nFigure 14 shows the net singly-imaged magnification distribution, for our fiducial model. For sources at redshift zs = 6,\nmagnifications of \u03bc \u223c 1.6 occur at the percent level, and the\ndistribution drops quickly. The probabilities for \u03bc > (2, 5, 10)\nare (0.3%, 9 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 ). In other words, significant\nsingly-imaged magnifications are rare.\nThere are nevertheless several qualitative results that are interesting and instructive. First, for \u03bc & 1.8 the singly-imaged\nmagnification probability is dominated by clusters. This result\nseems at first glance to contradict Comerford et al. (2002),\nwho found that massive NFW halos had negligible impact\non the probability for lensing magnification, but the apparent discrepancy is easily explained. Comerford et al. considered lensing with undetected multiple imaging, while we are\nconsidering the complementary case where there is only a single image. NFW halos are much more efficient at producing\nhighly magnified single images than multiple images (see Figure 12), which is why we find a much stronger effect. The\nimportant implication of this result is that if there is a significant singly-imaged magnification (\u03bc & 5) then the lensing\nobject is most likely a cluster, and ought to be relatively easy\nto detect. Conversely, lensing with small to moderate singlyimaged magnifications (\u03bc . 2) is dominated by galaxies. This\nis consistent with the claim by Shioya et al. (2002) that one of\nthe z \u2248 6 quasars is magnified by a factor \u03bc \u2248 2 by a foreground galaxy, with no obvious sign of a cluster.\nA second interesting feature of the singly-imaged magnification probability relates to the possible galaxy/dwarf transition at low masses. As discussed above, current lens data\nhint at the transition but do not constrain it well, so we consider three possible cases: (a) a model with no transition;\n(b) a model with the transition at log Mdwarf = 12.0; and (c)\na model with the transition at log Mdwarf = 12.5, which perhaps seems high but is formally the best fit to current data\n(although it is not significantly better than the other models).\nModels (a) and (c) are extremes that bound the range of reasonable possibilities, and model (b) is a sample intermediate model. Not surprisingly, Figure 14 shows that moving\nthe transition changes the relative contributions of galaxies\nand dwarf halos to the probability; if the transition occurs at\nlog Mdwarf & 12.0, dwarfs can conceivably contribute more of\nthe probability than normal galaxies. But the important result\nis that changing Mdwarf affects the net probability by <10%,\nsince the singly-imaged case is dominated by clusters.\nFigure 15 shows the multiply-imaged magnification probability, for different assumptions about the dwarf/galaxy transition and different single-detectable-image criteria (SDIC).\nIn general, nearly all of the probability comes from galaxies.\nClusters contribute <10\u22125 of the probability if we consider all\nimage configurations, and < 10\u22128 if we consider those with\nonly a single detectable image; so we confirm the result from\nComerford et al.

Here we give results for a model with the dwarf/galaxy transition at\nlog Mdwarf = 11.0, in addition to the three models discussed in the text.\n\nble for the multiply-imaged magnification probability. NFW\ndwarfs halos, if present in the model, likewise have a negligible contribution to the probability (no more than \u223c 10\u22127\neven in the model with log Mdwarf = 12.5). The main effect\nof having dwarfs in the model is to reduce the number of halos that are isothermal galaxies, and hence to reduce the net\nmultiply-imaged magnification probability. The reduction can\nbe substantial when the SDICs are important.\nPerhaps the most interesting result from Figure 15 is the\neffects of the SDICs. Consider the probability of a magnification \u03bc > 10, and suppose we have no knowledge of the\npresence or absence of additional images. Then we must use\nthe multiply-imaged probability with no SDICs, and add the\nsingly-imaged probability, which yields total probabilities of\n(2.1, 1.4, 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22124 for models (a), (b), and (c) respectively.\nHowever, suppose like Richards et al. (2004) we can rule out\nthe presence of extra images down to either \u2206\u03b8 = 0.\u2032\u2032 1 and\nf = 0.1, or \u2206\u03b8 = 0.\u2032\u2032 3 and f = 0.01. We should then use\nthe lowest of the multiply-imaged curves in Figure 15, and\nagain add the singly-imaged probability. A useful way to\nquantify the results is to give the fraction of systems magnified by \u03bc > 10 that do not have extra images detectable by\nRichards et al. (2004). This fraction is given by the ratio of\nthe probability with SDICs to the probability without, or differences between the curves in Figure 15; the results are given\nin Table 1. For example, in the no-dwarf model, about 24%\nof highly magnified systems are multiply-imaged such that\nthe extra images are undetectable, and another 5% are singlyimaged. In models with dwarfs, the fraction that are multiplyimaged without detectable extra images is much lower, so in\ntotal only 9\u201315% of highly magnified systems lack detectable\nextra images, and many of those are true singly-imaged systems lensed by clusters.\n5.3. Implications for the SDSS quasars\n\nSo far we have only considered a priori lensing probabilities, i.e., the bare optical depth for producing certain magnifications. However, to compute the probability of finding a\ncertain magnification in a real, flux-limited survey we would\nalso have to fold in magnification bias to obtain a posteriori\nprobabilities. Because the SDSS can probe only the steep,\nbright end of the quasar luminosity function at z \u2248 6, magnification bias may be quite strong, but it is is extremely sensitive to the poorly-known LF shape. (In fact, the problem\ncan be turned around so that lensing [or lack thereof] in the\nz \u2248 6 quasar sample yields constrains on the LF slope; see\nComerford et al. 2002 and Richards et al. 2004.) Rather than\nmaking detailed but highly LF-dependent predictions of the\na posteriori probabilities, we turn attention to probability ra-\n\n\f12\n\nF IG . 15.- Net multiply-imaged magnification probability distributions for sources at redshift zs = 6. In each panel, the upper solid curve shows the overall\nmultiply-imaged probability (regardless of the number of detectable images), and the two other solid curves show the probability with different criteria for\ndetecting only a single image (as indicated). The dashed curves show the contribution to each probability from galaxies alone (which is often indistinguishable\nfrom the total). The different panels correspond to different assumptions about the dwarf/galaxy transition. For comparison, the dotted curve shows the net\nsingly-imaged magnification distribution from Figure 14.\n\nF IG . 16.- Similar to Figure 15, but for a model in which all halos are spherical and there is no shear.\n\ntios and consider the following question: What is the ratio of\nthe probability for \u03bc > 10 with observational SDICs, to the\nprobability for \u03bc > 10 without SDICs? This is equivalent to\nthe question: In a toy model with magnification bias so strong\nthat all z \u2248 6 quasars are magnified by a factor \u03bc > 10, what\nis the probability that one of the quasars would have no additional images detectable by Richards et al. (2004)?\nIn general, probability ratios should be the same for a priori and a posteriori probabilities, so Table 1 is exactly what\nwe need. To summarize, if we are extremely optimistic about\nhaving strong magnification bias and about all low-mass halos having steep isothermal profiles, we can imagine that the\nprobability of a z \u2248 6 quasar being magnified by \u03bc > 10\nwithout having additional images detectable by HST might\nbe as high as 29%. If this is the case, we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that one of the four z \u2248 6 quasars observed by\nRichards et al. (2004) might actually be significantly magnified. However, even then the probability that all four are amplified would be P = (0.29)4 = 0.007. The actual probability\nis almost certainly much lower, because magnification bias is\nprobably not as strong as in the toy example, and because as-\n\nsuming that all low-mass halos have isothermal profiles probably overestimates the lensing optical depth. In other words,\nwe can rule out at more than 99.3% confidence the hypothesis\nthat all four z \u2248 6 quasars are amplified by more than a factor of 10 - provided we can equate a priori and a posteriori\nprobability ratios.\nThe only possible problem with equating the probability ratios is if the SDSS is somehow biased against high-redshift\nlensed quasars. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that\nthere were a total of 4/0.29 = 14 lensed and highly magnified z \u2248 6 quasars in the SDSS, 10 of which have not been\nidentified. Then having four quasars that are magnified but\nlack images detectable by Richards et al. (2004) would actually be consistent with the no-dwarf model. In our models\nwith dwarfs, the total number of lensed quasars needed would\nbe \u223c25\u201345 (see Table 1). The key question is whether so\nmany \"missing\" lensed high-redshift quasars could exist. The\nSDSS z > 5.8 quasar sample is selected on the basis of colors alone; the sample is basically i-dropouts, with some additional color criteria to reduce contaminants (Fan et al. 2000,\n2001, 2003). There is no requirement that the objects ap-\n\n\f13\npear point-like in SDSS images, and hence no bias against\nmultiply-imaged systems. The only remaining problem is if\nlight from a lens galaxy could change the composite colors\nof a lensed quasar system enough that the system would not\nbe selected as an i-dropout. Lens galaxies associated with\nz \u2248 6 lensed quasars would be expected to lie at redshifts\n1 . zl . 2 (see Fig. 1 of Comerford et al. 2002), and so would\nprobably be too faint to significantly change the colors (also\nsee Wyithe & Loeb 2002). While it would be interesting to\nquantify this effect more carefully,10 it seems unlikely that\nthe SDSS high-redshift quasar sample is highly biased against\nmultiply-imaged systems.\n5.4. Corollaries and Systematics\n\nWe have obtained our main result, namely answering the\nquestion of whether it is likely that the z \u2248 6 quasars are highly\nmagnified, but there are several corollaries worth mentioning.\nFirst, so far in this section we have allowed the galaxies to\nhave ellipticity and shear. (We have made certain assumptions\nabout the ellipticity and shear for dwarf and cluster halos, but\nthey are not so important; see \u00a7 5.1.) It is interesting to repeat\nthe analysis with all halos assumed to be spherical, to see how\nmuch ellipticity and shear affect the results. Figure 16 shows\nthe results. In the no-dwarf model, neglecting ellipticity and\nshear reduces the probability of multiple imaging with \u03bc > 10\nby 30\u201350%. The same holds in models with dwarfs for the\ntotal multiple imaging probability (with no selection effects).\nHowever, in models with dwarfs where the SDICs apply, the\nreduction is at least a factor of 5 and often much larger. This\nresult can be understood as follows. Most of the multiplyimaged magnification probability comes from the isothermal\nhalos called \"galaxies\" in our model. If there are no dwarfs,\nthen most of the probability comes from low-mass galaxies\nthat produce image separations too small to be resolved; so\nthe flux ratio SDIC is unimportant, and the probability is not\ndramatically sensitive to ellipticity (see the upper curves in\nFigure 5). By contrast, if low-mass halos are dwarfs (which\nhave negligible cross sections), then much of the probability must come from galaxies that produce image separations\nlarger than the resolution. In this case the flux ratio SDIC\nplays an important role; and in Figure 5 we saw that this dramatically reduces the cross section when the ellipticity is zero.\nThe bottom line is that ellipticity and shear are a factor of \u223c2\neffect in no-dwarf models, but can be an order of magnitude\neffect in models with dwarfs.\nThe second point is that there are several additional systematic uncertainties that might be relevant. We have considered three effects that have the most impact on strong\nlens statistics (see Kuhlen et al. 2004): (i) changing the halo\nmass function from that of Sheth & Tormen (1999) to that\nof Jenkins et al. (2001); (ii) changing the scatter in the Mc correlation for NFW halos from 0.14 dex to 0.07 dex or\n0.21 dex; and (iii) varying the location of the cluster/galaxy\ntransition by \u2206(log Mclus ) = \u00b10.25. We find that changing the\nmass function has the strongest effect, and even that is only\na \u223c10% change in the net magnification probability. In other\nwords, our results appear to be robust to effects other than the\nquestion of whether low-mass halos are isothermal galaxies\nor NFW dwarfs.\nFinally, our discussion has been geared toward sources at\n10 An analysis that begins with the empirical correlation between image separation and lens galaxy luminosity (see the Appendix of Rusin et al.\n2003a) would be reasonably straightforward.\n\nF IG . 17.- Total magnification probability distributions, including both\nthe singly-imaged and multiply-imaged contributions, as a function of source\nredshift zs = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 from top to bottom. Here we use the no-dwarf\nmodel to obtain the maximum possible probability.\n\nz \u2248 6, but for completeness in Figure 17 we show the net a\npriori magnification probability as a function of source redshift. We use the no-dwarf model as a way to obtain an upper\nbound on the probability; for the multiply-imaged case we use\nthe criteria \u2206\u03b8 < 0.\u2032\u2032 3 or f < 0.01 for detecting only a single\nimage, although from Figure 15a this choice is not so important. Reducing the redshift naturally reduces the probability,\nespecially for zs . 3. It affects the whole distribution in the\nsame way, so our general conclusions appear not to be highly\nsensitive to the source redshift. Pushing quasar and galaxy\nsamples beyond z \u2248 6 will not significantly increase the probability for large lensing magnifications.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe problem of lensing magnification without multiple detectable images has a rich phenomenology. First, there is the\ncase of true singly-imaged systems. Isothermal halos are not\nvery efficient at producing highly magnified single-image systems, but NFW halos are. Consequently, high singly-imaged\nmagnifications are possible in principle, and they are mainly\nassociated with massive (& 1013.5 M\u2299 ) halos corresponding to\nclusters of galaxies. An important implication for observations is that, if there is no evidence for a cluster along the\nline of sight to a distant quasar, then it is unlikely that there is\nstrong singly-imaged magnification.\nThe second case is when there are multiple images but the\nextra images are not detectable, either because the image splitting is too small to be resolved, or because the extra images\nare too faint. NFW halos are inefficient at producing multiple\nimages, and when they do they rarely produce extreme flux ratios; therefore, clusters contribute negligibly to the multiplyimaged magnification probability. Instead, this case is dominated by galaxies and lower-mass systems (. 1013 M\u2299 ). The\nprobability is very sensitive to the inner density profile of\nthese halos. If all low-mass halos have steep isothermal profiles, then the probability is dominated by lens systems with\nimage separations too small to be resolved by HST. However,\nif low-mass dwarf halos have NFW profiles (and hence small\ncross sections), then the overall probability is dominated by\nlens systems where the extra images are faint.\nOur central quantitative result is that 9\u201329% of all lens systems with magnifications \u03bc > 10 lack additional detectable\nimages. In a toy model where magnification bias is so strong\nthat most or all z \u2248 6 quasars are lensed, then we cannot rule\n\n\f14\nout the hypothesis that one of the four quasars observed by\nRichards et al. (2004) is magnified despite lacking extra images. However, even in such an extreme model, the probability that all four are magnified by a factor of 10 would\nstill be no more than 0.7%, and is probably much lower. The\nonly way to evade this argument is if the SDSS high-redshift\nquasar sample is somehow biased against quasar lens systems\nwith multiple bright images. That seems unlikely, although\na detailed analysis of whether light from a lens galaxy could\ncause the i-dropout selection technique to miss a lens system\nis needed to answer this question definitively.\nIncidentally, we can comment on the two different criteria\nused by Richards et al. (2004) to search for companion images to the z \u2248 6 quasars. Richards et al. were able to rule out\nextra images down to a flux ratio f = 0.01 at image splittings\ngreater than 0.\u2032\u2032 3, or down to a less stringent flux ratio f = 0.1\nfor smaller image splittings down to 0.\u2032\u2032 1. We find that for\nthe no-dwarf model, the two criteria give similar probability\nresults. By contrast, for models with dwarfs, the criteria with\nmore stringent flux bounds provide stronger constraints on the\nlensing probabilities. In other words, for the purpose of determining whether distant quasars are magnified by lensing, it\nis more valuable to aim for more dynamic range than to push\n\nfor resolution much better than \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 3.\nTo summarize, if the SDSS high-redshift quasar sample\nis not highly biased against multiply-imaged quasars, then\nit is quite improbable that all four quasars observed by\nRichards et al. (2004) are highly magnified. In that case, the\nquasars can be taken as good evidence for the presence of\nbillion-M\u2299 black holes in the young universe. Explaining\nsuch black holes is a challenge for black hole growth models, whose solution may involve a need for super-Eddington\naccretion (Haiman 2004). In other words, in the case of highredshift quasars, a lensing \"null result\" actually makes the objects even more interesting.\n\nWe thank Gordon Richards for helpful discussions about\nthe SDSS high-redshift quasar sample.

First, for a simple isothermal sphere the magnification\nof a singly-imaged source (u > Rein ) is \u03bc = 1 + Rein /u, so the maximum magnification for singly-imaged sources is \u03bcmax = 2. In\nfact, in this case the full singly-imaged magnification cross section can be derived analytically,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nA(\u03bc) = \u03c0R2ein\n\u2212\n1\n.\n(1 < \u03bc < 2)\n(A1)\n(\u03bc \u2212 1)2\nNext consider an isothermal sphere with external shear. The magnification as a function of position is\nRein\n(1 + \u03b3 cos2\u03b8) .\n(A2)\nR\n(We are now working in a coordinate system aligned with the shear, so \u03b8\u03b3 = 0 in these coordinates.) The radial caustic is a circle\nwith radius Rein . It maps to a curve in the image plane called the 1-2 transition locus, which marks the transition from single\nimages to images that are part of a two-image system, and which can be written in polar coordinates as (Finch et al. 2002)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 + \u03b3 cos2\u03b8\nR1\u22122 (\u03b8) = 2Rein\n.\n(A3)\n1 + 2\u03b3 cos2\u03b8 + \u03b3 2\n\u03bc\u22121 = 1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u2212\n\nFor \u03b3 < 1/3 the radial caustic completely encloses the tangential caustic, so all sources outside the radial caustic and all images\noutside the 1-2 transition locus are singly-imaged. In this case, the maximum singly-imaged magnification occurs at \u03b8 = 0 on the\n1-2 transition locus,\n2\n\u03bcmax =\n.\n(\u03b3 < 1/3)\n(A4)\n(1 \u2212 3\u03b3)(1 + \u03b3)\nFor \u03b3 > 1/3 the tangential caustic pierces the radial caustic to form a naked cusp (e.g., Schneider et al. 1992; Finch et al. 2002).\nSources just outside a naked cusp are singly-imaged but can have arbitrarily large magnifications, so \u03bcmax \u2192 \u221e in this case.\nFinally consider an isothermal ellipsoid. The magnification as a function of position is\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n2\nb\n\u22121\n\u03bc = 1\u2212\n.\n(A5)\nR (1 + q2) \u2212 (1 \u2212 q2) cos 2\u03b8\nWe cannot compute the full 1-2 transition locus, but we can compute where it intersects the x and y axes:\n\"p\n#\n1 \u2212 q2\n2b\n\u22121\ntan\nR1\u22122 (0) = p\nq\n1 \u2212 q2\nh\ni\np\n2b\n1 \u2212 q2\nR1\u22122 (\u03c0/2) = p\ntanh\u22121\n1 \u2212 q2\n\n(A6)\n(A7)\n\n\f15\nThe critical value of the axis ratio at which the tangential caustic pierces the radial caustic to form a naked cusp is found by\nsolving\n# p\n\"p\n1 \u2212 q2\n1 \u2212 q2\n\u22121\n\u2212\n= 0,\n(A8)\n2 tan\nq\nq\nwhose solution is q = 0.394, or ellipticity e = 0.606. For q < 0.394, the presence of a naked cusp again causes \u03bcmax \u2192 \u221e. For\nq > 0.394, the maximum singly-imaged magnification again occurs at \u03b8 = 0 on the 1-2 transition locus and has the value\n\u03bcmax =\n\nq R1\u22122 (0)\n.\nq R1\u22122 (0) \u2212 b\n\n(q > 0.394)\n\n(A9)\n\nREFERENCES\nBarkana, R., & Loeb, A. 2000, ApJ, 531, 613\nBartelmann, M. 1996, A&A, 313, 697\nBender, R., Surma, P., D\u00f6bereiner, S., M\u00f6llenhoff, C., & Madejski, R. 1989,\nA&A, 217, 35\nBlandford, R.
