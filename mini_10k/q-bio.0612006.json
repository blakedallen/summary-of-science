These studies showed the induction of several gene classes\ncorresponding to various biological functions. These functions encompass of course antigen processing\nand presentation, cytoskeleton, cell signalling and signal transduction, but also an increase of\nmitochondrial function and of the protein synthesis machinery, including some, but not all, chaperones.\nThese changes put in perspective the events occurring during this differentiation process. On a more\ntechnical point, it appears that the studies carried out at the RNA and protein levels are highly\ncomplementary.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are essential in the development of the immune responses. These cells reside in non\nlymphoid tissues where they capture, process and present antigens to circulating memory T cells. Upon\ndanger signals, DCs leave the non lymphoid tissues to reach lymphoid organs where they stimulate na\u00efve\nT cells. Dendritic cells can be differentiated in vitro from different precursors. One type of human DC\nprecursors is represented by blood CD34+ progenitor cells. These cells, cultured in presence of GM-CSF\nand TNF\u03b1, differentiate within two weeks in DCs following two pathways. Indeed, after 7 days of\ndifferentiation, two populations of precursor cells, either CD1a- CD14+ or CD1a+CD14-, are observed.\nThe CD1a+ population give rise to Langerhans cells, the epidermal DCs characterized by the presence of\nBirbeck granules, while the CD14+ generate DCs devoid of such organelles. These two types of DC\npopulations are also functionally different since only the DCs derived from CD14+ precursors are\ninvolved in the stimulation of B lymphocytes. Due to the relatively low numbers of DCs that can be\nderived from CD34+ cells, the differentiation of DCs from blood monocytes represent an convenient\nalternative. Blood monocytes can be easily differentiated into DCs in presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. For\nthis reason, most of the studies on DCs are performed using this type of DCs.\n\n\fIn this latter system, the differentiation into DC can be seen even at the morphological level. While the\nmonocytes are rather round cells, the dendritic cells, as their name implies, are covered of dendrites and\nare therefore more amoebic in shape. These dendrites are highly dynamic in nature, so that the cell shape\nvaries (Cella et al. 1997).\nHowever, little is known about the changes in gene expression occurring during this monocyte to DC\ntransition. In order to understand the main features of this differentiation, two approaches can be\ndeveloped. One has been used by several laboratories, and consists in the study of the modulation of the\namounts of different mRNA species during the differentiation. This technique was proved to be powerful\nin the characterization of new genes. Another technique consist to compare the levels of proteins\nexpressed by DCs and monocyte precursors. The present study was dedicated to the use of the proteomic\napproach in the study of DCs, and to compare the results with those obtained using the genetic analysis\nof differentially expressed genes.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nCell differentiation\nDCs were derived from elutriated human blood monocytes. Monocytes were isolated by continuous flow\ncentrifugation leukapheresis and counterflow centrifugation elutriation (Faradji et al. 1994) and cultured\nin RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax-I, 10% heat inactivated FCS, 1% sodium pyruvate and 50\nU/ml penicillin and streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 50 ng/ml\nrecombinant human GM-CSF and 40 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ).\nDifferentiated DCs were used at day 7 and the differentiation of monocytes was checked by flow\ncytometric analysis of surface markers (Saudrais et al. 1998). The resulting population was devoid of\nCD14 positive cells (monocytes) and contained over 80% CD11+, MHC I and II + cells (dendritic cells\nmarkers). The remaining lymphocytes and natural killer cells were removed by magnetic beads coated\nwith anti CD3 (lymphocytes) and CD 16 (NK) antibodies.\n\n\fRNA preparation\nTotal RNA from DCs and monocytes (107 cells) were isolated according to the method of Chomczynski\nand Sacchi (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1986) and mRNA were purified using oligo d(T)2 5 Dynabeads\n(Dynal, Oslo, Norway).\n\ncDNA differential gene bank\nThe DC cDNA library was made using the CapFinderTM PCR cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech,\nPalo Alto, CA, USA). The kit utilizes a CapSwitchTM oligonucleotide in the first-strand synthesis, followed\nby a long-distance (LD) PCR amplification to generate high yields of full-length, double-stranded cDNA.\nThe monocytes cDNA library was made using cDNA Synthesis Kit (Boehringer, Mannhein, Germany)\nand further digested with Rsa I for ligation with biotinylated adaptors. PCR using the corresponding\nbiotinylated primers were done to generate large amounts of this library.\n\nThe differential DC gene bank was obtained by repetitive cycles of denaturation at 90\u00b0C for 5 min,\nhybridization overnight at 42\u00b0C in an formamide containing buffer (Tris-HCl pH 7,7 100 mM, EDTA 2\nmM, NaCl 500 mM and 50% formamide) and substraction by streptavidine/ phenol-chloroform\nextraction using at each cycle ten time more cDNA from the monocyte biotinylated library than the initial\nDC cDNA.\n\nScreening of the differential gene bank\nThe resulting DC differential gene bank was cloned in a derivative of pCDM8 (Invitrogen, Groningen,\nThe Netherlands). Nucleotidic sequence of the clones was determined using the ABI PRISMR 377 DNA\nSequencer, and analyzed using Blast search program at NCBI library.\n\nRT-PCR\nTotal RNA from monocytes and DCs was obtained with an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Les Ulis,\nFrance). RNA was reverse transcribed with AMV reverse transcriptase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium)\nusing random hexanucleotides (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) as primers. cDNAs were then\n\n\famplified using different sets of specific oligonucleotides (Eurogentec) and different amounts of cDNA\n(reverse transcribed from 7 ng, 20 ng or 100 ng total RNA). Amplification was performed in an\nOmniGene Hybaid (Ashford, UK) thermocycler under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C 30\", 56\u00b0C 3 0 \"\nand 72\u00b0C 30\" for 20 cycles (actin), 94\u00b0C 30\", 56\u00b0C 30\" and 72\u00b0C 1 min for 35 cycles (CD63) or 30\ncycles (other). Amplification products were run on 2% agarose gels in parallel with molecular weight\nstandard (marker VI, Roche-Diagnostics). Length of these molecular standards, in the range of the PCR\nproducts, are 653, 517, 453, 394, 298 base pairs.\n\nProteomics\nTotal protein extracts were prepared from 107 cells by making first a concentrated cell suspension in\nisotonic Tris-EDTA-sucrose and diluting in a concentrated (1.25x) lysis solution to end up in 7M urea,\n2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM spermine base and 40 mM DTT (Rabilloud et al. 1997). After clearing\nby ultracentrifugation (200,000 g 30 min) the protein concentration of the extract was determined by a\ndye-binding assay. 150 \u03bcg of the extracts were applied to the first dimension gel (immobilized pH\ngradient, pH 4 to 8) by in-gel rehydration in 7M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.4% carrier\nampholytes (3-10) and 40 mM DTT (Rabilloud et al. 1997). Protein-loaded IPG strips were focused for\na total of 60,000 Vh, equilibrated 2x 10 min in Tris buffer containing urea and glycerol and supplemented\nwith 60 mM DTT (first equilibration) or 150 mM iodoacetamide (second equilibration) (G\u00f6rg et al.\n1987). The second dimension was a 10% acrylamide gel. After migration, the gels were stained with silver\n(Rabilloud et al. 1994). The gels were then analyzed with the Melanie software. The induction factor is\ndefined as the ratio between the abundance of the spot (in ppm of the total) in dendritic cells over\nmonocytes. The spots of interest (i.e., induced more than 2-fold in 3 different experiments) were then\nexcised and destained with ferricyanide-thiosulfate (Gharahdaghi et al. 1999). After gel washes in\nacetonitrile ammonium bicarbonate, the proteins were digested in-gel with trypsin (18 h). The resulting\npeptides were extracted with TFA/acetonitrile/water and the peptide mixture was analyzed by MALDI\nTOF using sinapinic acid as a matrix on a Bruker Biflex instrument with delayed extraction. Identification\nof the proteins using these mass fingerprinting data was carried out using the Mascot software.\n\n\fAlternatively, the identification of Prx III was carried out by comigration of a total DC extract with semi\npurified PrxIII from human placental mitochondria (Rabilloud et al. 1998).\n\nResults\n\nGeneral framework\nIn order to find differentiation markers for DCs, a differential RNA approach was first undertaken.\nNumerous differentially-expressed clones were found and about 150 were analyzed. These clones were\nfound to fall into 4 main classes, as shown in Table 1. Apart from \"miscellaneous classes\", such as\nnuclear proteins, these classes corresponded to biological functions relevant either directly to the role of\nDCs (e.g., antigen presentation) or, more indirectly, to functions implied in antigen processing and\npresentation (e.g., vesicular transport and cytoskeleton). The differential expression of these RNAs in\nmonocytes and monocyte-derived DCs was analyzed by RT-PCR, and typical results are shown on\nFigure 1. A relative quantification of the RT-PCR products was carried out by densitometry ans is shown\nas relative abundance ratios (DC/monocytes).\nTo complement these data at the protein level, a proteomics-based differential approach was also\nundertaken on the same cells, i.e., monocytes and DCs derived thereof. Classical proteomics using highresolution two-dimensional electrophoresis as a protein display was used. Typical 2D gel results are\nshown on Figure 2. Differentially-expressed proteins (at least two-fold) are shown on these gels by\narrows. These proteins were then identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, leading to the\nidentifications shown on Figure 2. Here again, the differentially-expressed proteins (summarized in Table\n2) pointed to several biological functions, as discussed below.\n\nAntigen presentation genes are induced during dendritic cell differentiation\nThe expression of various genes implied or presumed to have a fonction in antigen presentation (HLADRa, CD1E) is clearly increased during DC differentiation. These data are however obtained only at the\nRNA level, probably because of classical problems associated with the analysis of membrane proteins by\n2D electrophoresis (Wilkins et al. 1998). However, the RNA data are quite consistent with the antigen\n\n\fpresentation function of the DCs. Among those genes, CD1E has been studied in more detail (Ang\u00e9nieux\net al. 2000).\n\nAntigen processing machinery is induced during dendritic cell differentiation\nIn addition to antigen presentation per se, the antigen processing machinery is also induced during DC\ndifferentiation. This can be detected either at the RNA level (CD26 or peptidyl dipeptidase and CD63\nlysosomal protein) or at the protein level (grp78 and grp94 chaperones). It must be noted that these\nchaperones are expressed mainly in the ER and are very likely to contribute to the folding of the\nnumerous secreted and membrane proteins of the DCs, including of course the antigen presentation\nproteins.\nIn addition to these proteins, genes and proteins involved in antigen uptake are also found. Adaptor\nprotein 2 beta, involved in the formation of coated pits, and annexin II, involved in vesicular transport,\nbelong to this class, as well as the IgG receptor (FcgRII, CD32) and the b2 subunit of the complement\nreceptor (CD11b/CD18).\n\nMajor cytoskeleton changes occur during dendritic cells differentiation\nChanges in cytoskeleton-associated proteins were among the major changes detected either at the RNA or\nprotein levels. These changes occurred either directly on cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., vimentin) or on\nproteins involved in cytoskeleton remodelling (e.g., ARP 2/3 complex subunit, gelsolin). As DCs draw\ntheir name from the numerous membrane extensions they display on their surface, it is not surprising that\nthe underlying cytoskeleton shaping these blobs is modified compared to the situation of the monocyte\nprecursor. It must be noted that these changes in cytoskeleton-associated proteins can be found at both\nthe RNA and protein level, increasing thereby the confidence in the reality of cytoskeleton remodelling in\nDCs.\n\nMitochondrion function is increased in dendritic cells differentiation\nThis is a more surprising result observed during DC differentiation. Mitochondrion function increase is\nsupported mainly at the protein level (EFTu, MnSOD, glutamate dehydrogenase). The increase of EFTu\n\n\f(mitochondrial translation factor) is probably indicative of an increase in the production of the proteins\nencoded by the mitochondrial genome. As this genome only encodes respiratory complexes subunits, and\nmainly highly hydrophobic ones, it can be inferred that the increase of EFTu indicates an increase in the\nrespiratory complexes and therefore in energy production. This trend is further confirmed by the\ninduction of Krebs cycle-related proteins e.g. glutamate dehydrogenase.\nThe case of MnSOD appears somewhat more complicated. This protein is involved in the destruction of\nsuperoxide, which is produced by the respiratory complexes during their functioning. Thus, MnSOD\noverexpression can be seen as a further indirect evidence of respiratory increase. This hypothesis is\nsupported by the induction of PRX III, which is another mitochondrial protein playing a role in antioxidative stress defense (Araki et al. 1999). However, MnSOD increase is also observed during the\nresponse to pro-apoptotic signals (Asoh et al. 1989) and is thought to participate to the defense against\nthese signals. Thus, MnSOD overexpression can also be seen as a protection against the apoptotic signals\nwhich occur during the life of the DCs.\n\nCell communication and signalling\nSeveral RNAs and proteins involved in these processes are also found induced in DCs. Ionic regulators\n(calmodulin), as well as extracellular signalling proteins (MCP4), or proteins involved in signal\ntransduction (GBI-2) are found in this class. This variety indicates deep changes in the signalling activity\nof DCs compared to their precursors, a well-known phenomenon at the cytokines level (Cella et al. 1997).\n\nOther genes\n\nTwo other genes (DRP-2 and cytochrome b561) have been found to be overexpressed at the mRNA level\nin DCs compared to the monocyte precursors. DRP-2 is acting as a signal transducer involved in the\ndevelopment of nervous system (Kitamura et al. 1999) and cytochrom b561 (Srivastava 1995) as a pure\nelectron channel playing a role in the biosynthesis of peptide neurotransmitters. Since a bi-directional\ncommunication between the epidermal DCs, Langerhans cells, and nerves has been described (Torii et al.\n\n\f1997, 1998), these two proteins could be involved in the communication between immunological and\nneurologic system.\nA transporter of the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP) family, named MRP-4, was also\nshown to be mainly overexpress at the mRNA level in DCs compared to monocytes. A contribution of\nMRP-4 to the physiology and function of DCs can be hypothetised since MDR1, an other member of the\nfamily, has been involved in the migration capacity of DCs (Randolph et al. 1998). An interresting\nproperty of MRP4 is to extrude nucleoside analogues. The cell line CEM-R1 which over-express MRP4\ncan support the grow of HIV even in presence of nucleoside based anti-HIV drugs (Schuetz et al. 1999).\nWhether the expression of MRP4 in DCs contributes to the keeping of a HIV reservoir is provocative\nand should be investigated.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn order to study the genes which expression is increased during differentiation of monocytes into DCs,\ntwo differential approaches were carried out at the mRNA and protein level. These two approaches\nproved complementary and pointed\n\nmainly to the same biological functions. However, it seems\n\ninteresting to underline that there was no intersection between the genes evidenced by the two approaches.\nIn other words, none of the induced genes was found both at the RNA and protein level, and we would\nlike to try to find out the reasons for this kind of discrepancy.\n\nWhy does proteomics miss the genes detected by differential RNA analysis ?\n\nTheoretically, proteomics should be the ultimate tool to detect variations in gene expression, as it analyzes\nthe end product of gene expression, i.e., proteins. However, careful analysis of the possibilities of the\ntechnique points out to important limitations, which are evidenced by this work.\n\n\fThe first limitation lies in the analysis window displayed by the proteomics experiments which we have\ncarried out. For example, the pH window in the first dimension is 4 to 8. Therefore, basic proteins (e.g.,\ncalmodulin, MCP4), which mRNAs are found induced, are completely missed by the proteomics analysis.\n\nThe second important limitation is in the type of proteins which can be analyzed by proteomics. It is now\nwell evidenced that proteomics performs poorly in the analysis of membrane proteins (Adessi et al. 1997,\nWilkins et al. 1998). Thus, it is not surprising that induction of membrane proteins (e.g., HLA-DR,\nCD1E, CD18, CD32 and CD63, cytochrome b561) can be seen at the RNA level but not at the protein\nlevel. The same trend of poor visualization also applies to high molecular weight proteins (AP2, CREB\nbinding protein).\n\nThe third and important limitation lies in the visualization of low abundance proteins (Wilkins et al.\n1998). When total cell extracts are analyzed, the minimal abundance of proteins which can be detected in\nsilver-stained gels with reasonable crowding is 104 protein molecules per cell (by comparison, actin is\npresent at ca.108 molecules per cell). This figure represents an absolute detection minimum. Correct\nquantitative analysis requires to be at least 3 fold over this minimum. This implies in turn that low\nabundance proteins such as transcription factors or proteins involved in signal transduction are below the\nanalysis threshold of the technique.\n\nThese technical limitations point out to the weaknesses of proteomics. However, it must be pointed out\nthat many of these limitations can now be tried to be overcome, both for basic proteins (G\u00f6rg et al. 1998),\nfor membrane proteins (Santoni et al. 2000), and to a lesser extent for low abundance proteins by the\nanalysis of cell fractions enriched in the proteins of interest (e.g., nuclei, membrane preparations) and not\nof total cell extracts. Such work, however, needs the use of non-standard techniques or reagents and is\ntherefore much more difficult to carry out.\n\nWhy does differential RNA analysis miss the genes detected by proteomics ?\n\n\fFrom the previous paragraphs, it appears that differential RNA analysis does not show any of the\nlimitations shown by proteomics. Thus, the induced proteins evidenced by proteomics should also be\nfound induced at the RNA level, which is obviously not the case from our results. In order to get more\ninsights into this phenomenon, we performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on some RNAs which\nproteins were found induced by proteomics. The results are shown on Figure 3, and exemplify several\nsituations. In some cases, such as GP96 (grp94), an induction can be seen at the RNA level, but it can be\nnoticed that the basal level in monocytes is much higher than what is generally observed with the genes\ndetected as differentially expressed directly at the RNA level (compare with Figure 1). In other case, such\nas MnSOD, no induction can be seen at the RNA level, while a major induction is seen at the protein\nlevel. In other cases (EF-Tu, GBI-2) the RT-PCR results are difficult to interpret and a weak induction\ncan be detecteed at the RNA level.\nOur explanation for this situation is the importance of translational and post-translational controls, as\npreviously evidenced from the correlation analysis between RNA and proteins (Anderson and Seilhamer\n1997), (Gygi et al. 1999). A good example is the case of mitochondrial proteins (Anderson and Seilhamer\n1997). Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins show a very bad correlation between RNA and protein\nlevels, as exemplified in the liver for carbamoyl phosphate synthase (Anderson and Seilhamer 1997). This\nhas been attributed to the fact that mature mitochondrial proteins are protected from proteolytic\ndegradation by their localization and are therefore more readily accumulated at the protein level from\nrather low mRNA levels. Thus, during long processes such as the differentiation process studied here,\nlarge increase in the concentration of mitochondrial proteins can occur from marginal increase in the\ncorresponding mRNA levels. It is therefore not surprising that we find again a poor correlation between\nRNA and protein increases for the mitochondrial proteins we have identified, such as EF-Tu, or even\nworse MnSOD. In the latter case, there is a strong induction at the protein level, while the RNA level\ndecreases.\n\nThe case of vimentin is also typical of translational control. In the case of stimulation of fibroblasts by\nserum, it has been shown that although vimentin mRNA is present at high levels in quiescent cells it\n\n\fremains weakly translated, while it is highly translated in growing cells (Thomas and Thomas 1986). The\nsame situation probably also applies in our differentiation system for vimentin and the other cytoskeletonassociated proteins detected by proteomics.\n\nThese data clearly show that important protein variation can occur even with modest mRNA variations,\nand therefore that differential RNA display misses some important variations. It would be very interesting\nto check whether large variations in mRNA levels always lead to large variations in protein amounts, or if\ntranslational control can completely dampen the variations observed at the RNA level, leading to \"false\npositive\" obtained by RNA analysis. Unfortunately, this will be very difficult to find out in our system, as\nmost, if not all, of the genes found induced at the RNA level will not show their protein products in our\n2D gels.\nIt must ne noted that in some examples (ARP2/3, Grp94) there is a good correlation between the\nvariations observed at the RNA and protein levels. However, even in those cases, the variation in RNA\nlevels is rather weak and is not easily detected by differential display analysis. It is very likely that other\ntechniques, such as SAGE or array hybridization, will be more suited to this type of analysis. However,\nthe strong decorrelation observed for some classes of proteins (e.g. mitochondrial proteins) is completely\nindependent from the measurement methods is a real biological fact.\n\nWhat is the relevance of induced genes and proteins found to the biological process ?\n\nTaken together, the RNA and protein data point out to several classes of induced genes. They represent\nvarious biological functions which are obviously induced during DC differentiation from monocytes. The\nincrease in proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation is almost trivial in regard to HLA-DR\nowing to the role of DCs as professional antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, CD1e, which at the first\nglance belongs to the family of the CD1 antigen presenting molecules, was found to be quite different of\nother CD1 molecules in terms of biochemical properties and cellular location (Ang\u00e9nieux et al.),\nsuggesting a new function in CDs. Among the other classes, the changes in cytoskeleton-associated\nproteins is also rather obvious due to the strong morphological changes occurring during DC\n\n\fdifferentiation. However, the increase in metabolism (mitochondrial function) is more unexpected. Owing\nto the relevance of the other classes, and to the self-consistency of the changes observed in our study, it is\nvery likely that the changes observed point to a true increase of metabolism, which remain however to be\nexplained. The hypothesis we would like to put forward for this metabolism increase is related to the\nmajor changes in cellular shape and intracellular trafficking occurring in DCs as compared to monocytes.\nThe constant cytoskeleton remodelling occurring in DCs by their dendrites is probably highly energyconsuming, as is the intense intracellular trafficking related to massive antigen processing and\npresentation. These phenomena could explain why the mitochondrial energy production system is\ninduced in DCs, with a correlative induction of mitochondrial anti-oxidant proteins (MnSOD and PRX\nIII). It is well known that the respiratory chain is a major producer of reactive oxygen species (Raha and\nRobinson, 2000), so that an increase in respiration also results in an increase in reactive oxygen species\nproduction. The latter phenomena is counteracted by the increase in antioxidant proteins observed in\nDCs.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that these differential analyses made at both the RNA and protein level are highly\ncomplementary in their results and offer indeed good cross-validation. This cross-validation leads to good\nconfidence in the results, which seem also quite relevant to the biological question under study and give\nnew insights to the biochemical phenomena occurring during differentiation of monocytes into DCs.\n\n\fTable 1: Genes induced during DC differentiation, as detected by differential RNA analysis\n(numbers in parentheses refer to EMBL accession numbers)\n\nDescription\n\nEMBL\naccession number\n\nAntigen presenting genes :\n\nCD1e\n\nX14975\n\nHLA-DR\n\nM60333\n\nAntigen processing genes :\n\nCD18\n\nM15395\n\nCD26\n\nM74777\n\nCD32\n\nJ03619\n\nCD63\n\nM58485\n\nAP-50\n\nD63475\n\nCytoskeleton genes :\n\ngelsolin\n\nI11562\n\nCell communication and signalling genes :\ncalmodulin\nU16850\nMCP-4\n\nU46767\n\n\fOther genes (examples):\n\ndihydropyriminidase related-protein 2 (DRP-2)\n\nD78013\n\ncytochrome b561\n\nU29463\n\nMRP-4\n\nU83660\n\n\fTable 2: Genes induced during DC differentiation, as detected by proteomics\n(numbers in Parentheses refer to Swiss-Prot accession numbers)\n\nProtein name\n\nInduction factor\n(dendritic cells/monocytes)\n\nAntigen processing proteins:\ngrp78 (P11021)\n\n3.3\n\ngrp94-gp96 (P14625)\n\n3.5\n\nCytoskeleton proteins :\nvimentin (P08670)\n\n20\n\nARP2/3 34 kDa (O15144)\n\n4.1\n\nMitochondrial proteins:\nMn SOD (P04179)\n\n11.1\n\nPrx III (P30048)\n\n2.65\n\nEF-Tu (P49411)\n\n2.7\n\nGlutamate dehydrogenase (P00367)\n\n4.8\n\nCell communication and signalling proteins :\nGBI-2 (P04899)\n\n3.47\n\nAnnexin II (P07355)\n\n2.06\n\n\f\fLegend to figures\n\nFigure 1:\nSemi-quantitative analysis of the expression of some genes isolated from the differential DC gene bank.\nRNA was extracted from monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs.
