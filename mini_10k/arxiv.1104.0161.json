Introduction\nIn 2004 the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) gamma-ray telescope discovered several\npoint-sources of very high energy (VHE; > 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray emission near the dynamical centre\nof the Galaxy (the Galactic centre; GC [3]). These sources have since been shown to be coincident\nwith the GC (either the supermassive black hole, Sgr A* or a pulsar wind nebula [1]), and the\nsupernova remnant G0.9+0.1. It was then revealed \u2013 after the subtraction of these two sources \u2013 that\nthere also existed a band of diffuse TeV gamma-rays pervading the central regions of our Galaxy [3].\nFurthermore, [3] argued that this diffuse GC TeV gamma-ray emission was \"spatially correlated\"\nwith the integrated emission of the molecular gas, as traced by the CS(1\u20130) emission line [11] out\nto a Galactic longitude of \u223c 1\u25e6 , where the correlation with the molecular material became worse\n(c.f. Figure 1b from [3]). The presence of this correlation could indicate a hadronic origin for the\ndiffuse TeV gamma-ray glow at the GC, whereby the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction\nof CR protons and nucleons with the ambient nucleonic matter. In this manner, TeV gamma-rays\nare created from the decay of neutral pions created in the collisions via \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [4]1 . In all of the\nresulting studies of the diffuse TeV emission, the inferred results rest \u2013 crucially \u2013 on the assumption\nof the strength of the correlation between the molecular gas and the diffuse TeV gamma-rays. We\nbegin to rectify the deficit in the observational domain, where there has not been a commensurate\neffort to investigate the strength of the correlation between the molecular gas of the GC and (both)\nthe (point-like and) diffuse TeV gamma-ray emission. In this proceeding, we explore the nature of\nthe gas in this region and how implications from the assumption of a hadronic origin to the diffuse\ngamma-rays are manifest in the molecular-line and TeV gamma-ray data.\n\nFigure 1: The radio continuum 8.5 GHz view of the Galactic centre [10] with the major sources labelled\nand units of Jy/beam and associated (white) contours. The black HESS contours at 290, 300, 320, 340 and\n360 excess counts. The resolution of the radio continuum is 3.50 , and is indicated by the beam in the lower,\nleft-hand corner.\n1 It\n\nshould be noted, however, that the correlation does not rule out a \"leptonic scenario\" \u2013 whereby the TeV gammarays are created by the up-scattering of lower-energy photons from ambient light fields by in situ accelerated electrons \u2013\nas an explanation for the observed emission [2].\n\n2\n\n\fMolecular gas and gamma-ray morphologies in the Central Molecular Zone\n\n1.1 The data\n1.1.1 The radio continuum data\nThe radio continuum study of the Galactic centre by [10] was designed for spectral index studies\nof the region roughly corresponding to the CMZ. They used the Greenbank radio telescope (GBT)\nat 0.33, 1.4, 4.8 and 8.5 GHz to map the region with a resolution, at 8.5 GHz of 1.50 and an RMS\nsensitivity of 9 mJy/beam (see Table 1 of [10] for information on the survey at other wavelengths).\nIn this work, we use only the 8.5 GHz data (see Jones D. et al forthcoming for a more complete\ndiscussion of this data in regards to the diffuse TeV gamma-rays from the GC).\n\n1.1.2 The Mopra CMZ survey data\nThe Mopra CMZ survey ([6], Jones P. et al., 2011, in prep.) is a molecular line mapping survey\nof the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy extending approximately 3\u25e6 along the Galactic\nplane and 0.25\u25e6 out of the plane \u2013 an extent of \u223c 450 \u00d7 150 pc. The survey samples the CMZ\nat frequencies between 86 GHz and 115 GHz with the 22-m Mopra radio telescope2 using the\nUNSW-MOPS spectrometer on Mopra, combined with on-the-fly mapping and the MMIC receiver.\nThe survey consists of data-cubes with a velocity resolution of \u223c 1 km/s over the 8 GHz bandwidth\n(corresponding to a velocity range of roughly \u2212300 to +300 km/s), an angular resolution of \u223c 4000\nand an RMS noise of TMB \u223c 0.05 K per channel [6].\n1.1.3 The HOPS data\nThe H2 O Plane Survey (HOPS; [9], Walsh et al., 2011, in prep.) is also a molecular line mapping\nsurvey which intends to map a large portion of the southern Galaxy with the 12 mm receiver on the\nMopra radio telescope. The main impetus for this survey is to observe the NH3 inversion transitions,\nas well as the H2 O(616 \u2013523 ) maser line at 22.235 GHz to locate and characterise the dense molecular\ncores along the (southern) Galactic plane. The survey observes frequencies between 19.5 GHz and\n27.5 GHz with the 22-m Mopra radio telescope and consists of data-cubes with a velocity resolution\nof \u223c 0.4 km/s over the 8 GHz bandwidth (corresponding to a velocity range of roughly \u2212300 to\n+300 km/s), a resolution of \u223c 15000 and an RMS noise of TMB \u223c 0.4 Jy/beam [9].\n1.1.4 The HESS data\nThe High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) of very high energy gamma-ray telescopes\nis situated in Namibia, Southern Africa, and uses the atmospheric Cherenkov technique to image\ngamma-ray sources. The ridge of VHE gamma-rays which we discuss here was reported in [3] and\nobtained by the subtraction of the two point sources and is an excess counts image (as opposed to a\nsignificance image), which represents significant excess counts above the background of cosmic-rays\nand a resolution (FWHM) of 11.30 .\n2 The\n\nMopra radio telescope is part of the Australia Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia\nfor operations as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.\n\n3\n\n\fMolecular gas and gamma-ray morphologies in the Central Molecular Zone\n\n2. Morphological correspondence of different wavebands with TeV gamma-rays\n2.1 Correspondence with radio data\nFigure 1 shows the GC region at 8.5 GHz from [10] overlaid with (white) 8.5 GHz and (black)\nTeV gamma-ray contours. This shows that, because there is no issue with optical depth of the\nthermal (mainly from HII regions) and non-thermal (mainly from supernova remnants \u2013 SNRs \u2013 and\nthe Radio Arc) photons, the dense cores of molecular clouds such as Sgr B2 correspond well with\nthe peaks of the gamma-ray emission. However, the correspondence seems to fall down because the\nemission in the radio is dominated more by compact sources (for the coarse HESS beam), such as\nHII regions and SNRs, rather than a broad distribution of matter that the molecular lines trace (c.f.\nFigures 3 and 4). We also note some correspondence between the Sgr D SNR and a local gamma-ray\npeak. However, given the fact that the Sgr D SNR is likely a background object compared to the\nCMZ [8], we suggest that the gamma-ray emission from this region is not physically connected to\nthe CMZ.\n\nFigure 2: A velocity longitude plot of (a) NH3 (3,3) rotational line and (b) HCN(1\u20130) emission in the GC\nregion. Note that the resolution in the NH3 images is \u223c 15000 , whereas the resolution of the HCN(1\u20130) image\nis \u223c 4000 , so that the distributions of the molecules are quite similar in both cases. The intensity scale on the\nright is temperature in K.\n\n2.2 Correspondence with HOPS data\nFigure 2(a) shows a longitude\u2013velocity (l \u2212 v) plot for NH3 (3,3) illustrates how the NH3\nemission does not suffer from absorption due to local clouds, unlike the HCN(1\u20130) emission in\nFigure 2(b) (in which the absorption is seen as horizontal streaks through velocities around 0 km/s).\nThis does not imply, however, that the NH3 data possesses the advantage that when integrating the\nemission along the line of sight because of the lack of absorption by foreground clouds (although,\nthis was an important consideration in the use of the CS(1\u20130) emission line data from [11] in the\noriginal HESS publication [3]). The NH3 emission does suffer from optical depth effects, which\nmay not be clear from Figure 2(a). The determination of how much absorption the NH3 emission\nsuffers is complex, since the hyperfine lines are blended near the GC due to the wide line widths\n(as evidenced in Figure 2). Thus radiative transfer modelling is required for the full interpretation\n4\n\n\fMolecular gas and gamma-ray morphologies in the Central Molecular Zone\n\nof the NH3 data, whereas the optical depth analysis performed using the HCN(1\u20130) tracer and its\nisotopologue actually corrects for the foreground absorption of HCN.\nFigure 3 shows the result of integrating the NH3 (2,2) inversion transition line from -200 to\n200 km s\u22121 and convolving the image with a Gaussian beam of a resolution equal to that of the\nHESS data. This shows that the NH3 emission at temperatures and densities which this line traces\n(viz. nH \u223c 104 cm\u22123 and Tex \u223c 70 K) are dominated by the Sgr B cloud complex, although there\nare also peaks which are at or near the Sgr C (at negative Galactic longitude) HII region and the\nl = 1.3\u25e6 cloud complex.\n\nFigure 3: Integrated emission image (over the range -200 to 200 km s\u22121 in units of K km s\u22121 ) of the NH3\n(2,2) rotational line. Overlaid on the total intensity are (white) HESS contours at 290, 300, 320, 340 and 360\nexcess counts and (black) NH3 (2\u20132) contours at 20% to 90% in steps of 10%. The 11.30 beam, which the line\nemission has been convolved with is shown in the lower left-hand corner.\n\nWe note here that although the l = 1.3\u25e6 complex is considered part of the CMZ, the fact that\nit does not seem to be illuminated by TeV gamma-rays is not necessarily because of (a lack of)\ndiffusive particles from a central source. As alluded to above, the structure of the components of GC\nsources suggests that the SNR/HII region Sgr D and the l = 1.3\u25e6 are on opposite sides of the GC [8]\nso that the distances that CRs would have to traverse from source to target may be even larger than\nsuspected.\n2.3 Correspondence with CMZ data\nFigure 4 shows the result of integrating the HCN(1\u20130) emission from -200 to 200 km s\u22121 over\nthe CMZ and smearing to the HESS resolution. The HCN(1\u20130) emission line is the brightest line\nobserved in the CMZ dataset and Figure 4 shows that, unlike the NH3 (2,2) emission shown in\nFigure 3, there are several bright peaks (although the Sgr B GMC is certainly the brightest in Figure\n4), corresponding to Sgr C, Sgr A, Sgr B and the l = 1.3\u25e6 complex in order of increasing Galactic\nlongitude.\nFigure 4 shows that the HCN(1\u20130) emission, broadly, follows that of the TeV gamma-rays in\nthe GC region. However, it does depart from the gamma-ray distribution in a couple of ways.

The 11.30 beam, which\nthe line emission has been convolved with is shown in the lower left-hand corner.\n\nof the CMZ region; [11]), more-so than even the TeV gamma-ray distribution. Additionally, the\nHCN(1\u20130) emission seems to follow a narrower distribution, in Galactic latitude than the gammarays \u2013 although this is probably a function of the temperature and density (viz. nH & 104 cm\u22123\nand Tex \u223c 70 K) that the HCN(1\u20130) molecule traces. This means that the HCN(1\u20130) molecules are\ntracing the dense clumps or cores of clouds, and not the broad distribution that lines such as the\n12 CO(1\u20130) emission line traces3 .\n\n3. Optical depth estimation\nFrom the CMZ survey, we have been able obtain images of the CMZ with several isotopologues\nso that, amongst other things, the estimation of the optical depth is possible. Figure 5 (a) and (b) show\nvarious observational parameters that we have derived from the HCN/H13 CN(1\u20130) isotopologue\npair. We have done this for nine regions within the CMZ, of which Figure 5(a) and (b) represent two,\nlocated at (l, b)=(0,0) \u2013 towards Sgr A, and (l, b)=(0,-0.6) \u2013 containing little gamma-ray emission\nand labelled as position 6 and 7 in the figure respectively. In order to obtain the parameters on the\nsame size scales that the TeV gamma-ray data samples, we have smeared the data to the resolution\nof the HESS data (FWHM of 11.30 ), clipped emission below the 5 \u2212 \u03c3 noise level (apart from when\ndetermining the antenna temperature, TA\u2217 ) and obtained the brightness temperature over the entire\nvelocity range. From this, we have derived several observational parameters, such as the profiles for\nHCN, H13 CN, their ratio, the optical depth (\u03c4) for HCN(1\u20130) derived from the HCN/H13 CN ratio,\nand the upper state column density (Nu , with no extinction correction).\nFigure 5(a) and (b) shows that at these positions, the HCN line emission possesses an optical\ndepth of about 2\u20134 at all velocities. This is (i) found for all tracers in the CMZ sample; and (ii) the\nis well known that the 12 CO(1\u20130) transition traces low density (\u223c 100 cm\u22123 ) regions, which are typical for a\nlarge filling factor of the CMZ volume.\n3 It\n\n6\n\n\fMolecular gas and gamma-ray morphologies in the Central Molecular Zone\n\n0.1\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nvelocity (km s-1)\n\n100\n\n150\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n1\n\n10\n\ncm )\n\n1\n\n100\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n200\n\n0.01\n-150\n\n14\n\n10\n\n0.01\n-150\n\nTA\nHCN/H13CN\noHCN\nNu\n\n(b) position 7\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n100\n\nNu (10\n\nTA (K)\n\n100\n\nTA (K)\n\nTA\nHCN/H13CN\noHCN\nNu\n\n(a) position 6\n\nNu (1014 cm-2)\n\n100\n\n0.1\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nvelocity (km s-1)\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0.01\n200\n\nFigure 5: Plots of the antenna temperature (TA ), the ratio of isotopologue (HCN/H13 CN), the optical depth\n(\u03c4) of the HCN and the upper state column density (Nu ) at (a) position 6 \u2013 corresponding to Sgr A \u2013 and (b)\nposition 7 \u2013 corresponding to a region relatively free of gamma-ray and molecular line emission.

Additionally, this could possibly explain the offset of the peaks of\ngamma-ray emission in the GC and the better match with the peak emission of the NH3 (2,2) and\n8.5 GHz GBT emission: the gamma-ray emission is tracing the HII regions, but the tracers are less\nbright at these peaks due to the high optical depth.\nThe most powerful feature of this analysis, however, is that we will be able to (i) use the\ndifferent isotopologue pairs (HCN/H13 CN, HCO+ /H13 CO+ , HNC/HN13 C and CS/13 CS) to explore\nand produce maps of the optical depth and other parameters which cover a range of excitation\ntemperatures, number (and column) densities and chemistries. This will enable us to more fully\nexplore how well the TeV gamma-rays correlates with the molecules in the GC region.\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe have compared the morphology of each molecular-line and radio continuum bands to the\nTeV gamma-ray emission in the CMZ at the HESS resolution. We have found that there is optically\nthick molecular gas present for all lines at all positions at all velocities within the CMZ, even where\nstrong molecular-line and gamma-ray emission is not present. This will manifest itself as an underestimation of the mass in the CMZ and may be responsible for the discrepancy between the peaks in\nthe gamma-ray emission compared to the molecular-line emission. The fitting of telescopes, such as\nthe Mopra telescope, with wide-band correlators has provided a boon to molecular line astronomy.\nThe results of surveys of the type that have been described and used here, can be especially powerful\nin gamma-ray astronomy's quest to elucidate the source of acceleration of protons and/or electrons\nto very high energies.\n7\n\n\fMolecular gas and gamma-ray morphologies in the Central Molecular Zone\n\nReferences\n[1] Acero, F., Aharonian, F.
