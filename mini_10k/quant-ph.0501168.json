The existence\nof this force commonly called Casimir-Polder (CP) force\nis experimentally well established. Casimir-Polder forces\nhave been observed via mechanical means using atomic\nbeam scattering [1] and transmission [2] as well as quantum reflection [3], and via spectroscopic means [4], inter\nalia frequency modulated selective reflection spectroscopy\n[5]. They are crucial for the understanding of many phenomena in nature such as the adsorption of atoms or\nmolecules to surfaces [6] or even the remarkable climbing skills of some geckoes and spiders [7,8]. Apart from\ntheir important role in atomic-force microscopy [9], major\napplications of CP forces have been found in the field of\natom optics [10], where they have been used to construct\natomic mirrors [11], which in connection with evanescent\nelectromagnetic waves can even operate state-selectively\n[12].\nIf the atom is not too close to the surface of any of the\nbodies, a theoretical understanding of the CP force can\nbe obtained within the framework of macroscopic QED.\nSo, Casimir and Polder derived the force from the atomfield coupling energy calculated in lowest-order perturbation theory [13], yielding the potential-in the following\nreferred to as the van der Waals (vdW) potential-from\na\n\nElectronic address: s.buhmann@tpi.uni-jena.de\n\nwhich the force can then be derived. This approach first\napplied to the case of a ground-state atom placed in front\nof a perfectly conducting plate was later extended to excited atoms [14] as well as to atoms between two perfectly\nconducting plates [15]. Moreover, the concept has been\nused to calculate the force acting on an atom placed in\nfront of a semi-infinite dielectric half space [16], near a\ncarbon nanotube [17], or between two dielectric plates of\nfinite thickness [18]. Recently, the ideas of Casimir and\nPolder have been generalized to allow for dispersing and\nabsorbing bodies [19,20]. In parallel with the exact QED\napproach, a semiphenomenological method has been established and widely used. According to this approach, the\ncoupling energy is expressed in terms of correlation functions for the atom and/or the electromagnetic field which\nin turn are related to susceptibilities via the dissipationfluctuation theorem. The result-which in principle applies to arbitrary geometries-was first used for a groundstate atom placed in front of a perfectly conducting half\nspace [21], a dielectric half space [22], and a dielectric twolayer system [23]. Later, atoms in excited energy eigenstates were included in the concept [24]. Effects of surface roughness [25] and finite temperature [26,27] and-in\nthe case of the semi-infinite half space-different materials\nsuch as birefringent dielectric [28] or even magnetodielectric matter [29] have been studied.\nIn the large body of work on forces between polarizable objects the electric properties of the involved objects have typically been the focus of interest. Nevertheless, the fact that Maxwell's equations in the absence of\n(free) charges and currents are invariant under a duality\ntransformation between electric and magnetic fields can\n\n\f2\n\nStefan Yoshi Buhmann et al.: Casimir-Polder interaction of atoms with magnetodielectric bodies\n\nbe exploited to extend the notion of these forces to magnetically polarizable objects. Thus, knowing the attractive force between two electrically polarizable atoms, one\ncan infer the existence of an analogeous attractive force\nbetween two magnetically polarizable atoms, which may\nbe obtained from the former by replacing the electric polarizabilities by the corresponding magnetic ones. In contrast, the force between two atoms of opposed polarizability (i.e., electric/magnetic) is repulsive [30]. While the\nrepulsive force in the retarded limit obeys the same power\nlaw [31,32], the leading contribution to the repulsive force\nin the nonretarded limit is weaker than the corresponding\nattractive force between two electrically polarizable atoms\nby two powers in the atom-atom-separation [33]. A similar hierarchy of attractive and repulsive forces with corresponding asymptotic power laws has been found for the\nCasimir force between two semi-infinite half spaces possessing electric or magnetic properties, respectively [34]\n(see also Sec. 4.2).\nSurprisingly, the CP force between a single atom and\na macroscopic body has not yet been considered in detail in this context. The repulsive retarded force found\nfor a magnetically polarizable atom interacting with a\nperfectly conducting plate implies-by virtue of a duality transformation-that the retarded force between an\nelectrically polarizable atom and an infinitely permeable\nplate should also be repulsive, which provides interesting opportunities. A thorough analysis of the CP force\nbetween a single atom and a system of genuinely magnetodielectric bodies is desirable for three reasons: First, the\navailability of sensitive spectroscopic measurement techniques [5] suggests that in this case an experimental verification of repulsive forces is much more likely than in the\ncase of two macroscopic bodies, where the mechanic measurements are currently restricted to distance regimes of\npurely attractive forces [35]. Second, the rapidly increasing\namount of miniaturization in current technologies shows\nthat CP-type forces will have to be thoroughly taken into\naccount in the near future. Even today, Casimir forces are\nresponsible for the problem of the sticking of nanodevices\ncommon in nanotechnology [34], while CP forces can pose\nsevere limits on the trap lifetime on atom chips [36]. Third,\nthe recent fabrication of metamaterials with controllable\nmagnetic and electric properties in the microwave regime\n[37,38] and the rapid developments in this field imply the\nquestion of to what extent CP forces could be shaped by a\nclever use of magnetodielectrics with appropriate properties. A thorough analysis of the dependence of CP forces-\nincluding both perturbing and desirable effects-on relevant material and geometrical parameters can therefore\nadd further impetus to the research and design of new\nmaterials as well as show the direction towards which intensified efforts should be aimed-having in mind the future perspective of CP-force engineering.\nIn this paper we study-within the frame of exact\nquantization of the macroscopic electromagnetic field in\nlinear, causal media (reviewed in Sec. 2)-the CP interaction between a single atom and an arbitrary arrangement of linear, dispersing, and absorbing magnetodielec-\n\ntric bodies. We approach the problem from two sides, by\nfirst considering the perturbative atom-field coupling energy (Sec. 3.1), and by second going beyond perturbation theory, presenting a dynamical approach based on the\nLorentz force averaged with respect to the body-assisted\nelectromagnetic vacuum and the internal atomic motion\n(Sec. 3.2). Section 4 is then devoted to the particular problem of the competing effects of the electric and magnetic\nmaterial properties on the CP force acting on a groundstate atom placed within a genuinely magnetodielectric\nmultilayer system, where we study the examples of asymptotically thick and thin plates (Secs. 4.1 and 4.2, respectively) as well as a simple planar cavity (Sec. 4.3) in more\ndetail. Finally, a summary and some concluding remarks\nare given in Sec. 5.\n\n2 QED in dispersing and absorbing\nmagnetodielectric media\nThe study of the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field in the presence of linearly responding magnetodielectric bodies requires quantization of the electromagnetic field in linear, causal media. Consider an arbitrary arrangement of neutral, linear, isotropic, dispersing, and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies, which can\nbe characterized by their (relative) electric permittivity\n\u03b5(r, \u03c9) and their (relative) magnetic permeability \u03bc(r, \u03c9).\nBoth quantities are complex-valued functions that vary\nwith space and-in accordance with the Kramers-Kronig\nrelations-with frequency. Note that for absorbing media\nwe have Im \u03b5(r, \u03c9) > 0 and Im \u03bc(r, \u03c9) > 0.

The inhomogeneous part of the vacuum fluctuations of the body-assisted\nelectromagnetic field, in combination with the quantum\nfluctuations of the atomic electric dipole moment, can be\nregarded responsible for the CP force.\n\n3.1 Perturbative treatment\nIn the perturbative treatment, the CP force acting on an\natom in an energy eigenstate |li (with corresponding energy El ) is commonly derived from the lowest-order energy shift \u2206El of the state |li|{0}i due to the (electric\npart of the) interaction Hamiltonian (31), which is a good\napproximation provided that both the internal and the\ncenter-of-mass motion of the atom are nonrelativistic. The\nposition-dependent part of the energy shift is interpreted\n\n(38)\n\nEquation (38) can be interpreted in several ways. So it can\nbe regarded as giving the force in the Newtonian equation\nof motion for the center-of-mass coordinate, which is further evaluated within the frame of quantum mechanics\n(cf., e.g., the analysis of quantum reflection in Ref. [41])\nor, if possible, also within the frame of classical mechanics\n(cf., e.g., Ref. [1]). In any case the center-of-mass motion\nshould be sufficiently slow, so that it (approximately) decouples from the electronic motion in the spirit of a BornOppenheimer approximation. Equation (38) can also be\nregarded as determining the force that must be compensated for in the case where the center-of-mass coordinate\nmay be considered as a given (classical) parameter controlled externally. Since there is no need here to distinguish between the possible interpretations, the operator\nhat can be dropped.\nThe leading-order energy shift is given by the secondorder term\nZ \u221e\nZ\nd\u03c9\n1X X\nP\nd3 r\n\u2206El = \u2212\n~\n\u03c9kl + \u03c9\n0\nk \u03bb=e,m\n\n\u00d7 hl|h{0}| \u2212 d\u0302 * \u00ca(rA )|{1\u03bb (r, \u03c9)}i|ki\n\n2\n\n(39)\n\n[P, principal part; |{1\u03bb (r, \u03c9)}i \u2261 f\u03bb\u2020 (r, \u03c9)|{0}i].

First, it is known that the presence of\nmacroscopic bodies can give rise to a considerable change\nin the atomic level structure by inducing shifts and broadenings of atomic transitions-an effect that is clearly not\naccounted for in the lowest-order atomic polarizability as\ngiven by Eq. (45). Second, spontaneous decay of an atom\ninitially prepared in an excited state will necessarily induce a dynamical evolution of the force, a description of\nwhich is beyond the scope of a time-independent theory.\nThird, the perturbative treatment does not answer the\nquestion of the force acting on an atom not prepared in\nan eigenstate of the atomic Hamiltonian (27). Fourth, it\nseems difficult to generalize the perturbative method towards a theory that allows for electromagnetic fields prepared in arbitrary states-thus extending the concept of\nCP forces beyond a pure vacuum theory. And fifth, perturbative methods break down completely in the case of\nstrong atom-field coupling.\nIn order to obtain an improved understanding of the\nCP force, we consider a dynamical theory, the starting\npoint being the Lorentz force as appearing in the center-ofmass equation of motion of the atom. Using Hamiltonian\n(34) together with Eqs.

Needless to say\nthat they also apply to left-handed materials [37,38,42], for\nwhich standard (normal-mode) quantization runs into difficulties. Moreover, the derivation given can be regarded as\na foundation of results obtained on the basis of (semiphenomenological) linear response theory [23,27,29]. It should\nbe pointed out that the ground-state potential obtained\nfrom Eq.

From Eqs. (55) and (57) it is seen\nthat-as expected-spontaneous decay gives rise to a temporal evolution of the CP force, which is governed by the\ntemporal evolution of the respective diagonal density matrix elements. Only if the atom is initially (at time t = 0)\nprepared in its ground state (l = 0), a time-indepent force\nF\u0302(t) = F\u0302(0) = F0 (rA ) = For\n0 (rA )\n\n(68)\n\ncan be observed. When on the contrary the atom is initially prepared in an excited state (l 6= 0), then the initial\nsingle-component force\nF\u0302(0) = Fl (rA )\n\n(69)\n\n\fcan be observed only for times t \u226a \u0393l\u22121 (rA ), i.e.,\nF\u0302(t) \u2243 Fl (rA ),\n\nt \u226a \u0393l\u22121 (rA ).\n\n(70)\n\nIn the further course of time the single-component force\nevolves into a multi-component force at intermediate times\n(the atom being in a mixed state) and eventually reduces\nto the ground-state force for large times,\nF\u0302(t) \u2243 F0 (rA ),\n\n\u22121\nt \u226b \u0393m\n(rA ) \u2200 m \u2264 l.\n\n(71)\n\nF1r (zA )32\u03c0\u03b50 \u03bb4Te \u00d7 10\u22129 /(3|d10 |2 )\n\nStefan Yoshi Buhmann et al.: Casimir-Polder interaction of atoms with magnetodielectric bodies\n\nF1r (zA )32\u03c0\u03b50 \u03bb4Te \u00d7 10\u22129 /(3|d10 |2 )\n\nThus the perturbative treatment of Sec. 3.1 effectively\nturns out to be an approximate calculation of the force\ncomponents Fl (rA ), thereby disregarding the effects of\nlevel shifting and broadening. On the contrary, the force\ncomponents as given by Eqs. (64) and (65) depend on the\ncorrect shifted and broadened atomic transition frequencies (67) that are observed in the presence of the bodies, and hence also on the correct body-assisted positionreplacements\ndependent polarizability (66). InspectionPSfrag\nof Eqs.\n(64)\u2013\n(67) reveals that the frequency shifts affect both groundand excited-state force components, whereas the decayinduced level broadening only has a noticeable (reducing)\neffect on the resonant force components present for atoms\nin excited states. For example, the resonant force component Fr1 (zA ) = F1r (zA )ez acting on an excited two-level\natom situated at a very small distance zA from a semiinfinite dielectric half-space is given by [20]\nF1r (zA ) = \u2212\n\n3|d10 |2 |\u03b5[\u03a910 (zA )]|2 \u2212 1\n4 |\u03b5[\u03a9 (z )] + 1|2 .\n32\u03c0\u03b50 zA\n10 A\n\n2\n\u03c9Te\n\n2\n\u03c9Pe\n,\n\u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03b3e\n\n(73)\n\nit is seen that the typical dispersion profile already observed in the perturbative treatment becomes narrower\ndue to the level shifting while the level broadening has the\neffect of lowering and broadening the dispersion profile.\nThe different behaviour of the resonant and off-resonant\nforce components with respect to the effect of level broadening is closely related to the fact that Frm (rA ) [Eq. (65)\ntogether with Eq. (67)] is linear in \u0393m (rA ) in lowest order, whereas For\nm (rA ) [Eq. (64) together with Eq. (66)] is\nonly quadratic in \u0393m (rA ), as a Taylor expansion shows.\nPhysically, this can be understood from the argument that\nthe off-resonant force components can be regarded as being due to virtual transitions which happen on very short\ntime scales, so that spontaneous decay cannot have a major influence.\nIt is worth noting that the additional position-dependence introduced via the frequency shifts and broadenings\nhas the effect that even the ground-state force cannot\nbe derived, in general, from a potential in the way prescribed by Eqs. (37) and (38) in Sec. 3.1. While the force\nas given by Eq. (55) can of course still be written as a\n(time-dependent) potential force provided that the force\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n\u22123\n1.12\n3\n\n1.13\n\n1.14\n\n1.13\n\u03c910 /\u03c9\n\u03c9Te10 /\u03c9 T\n\n1.14\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u22123\n1.12\n\n(72)\n\nFrom Fig. 1, which shows F1r (zA ) for the case of the permittivity being modelled by\n\u03b5(\u03c9) = 1 +\n\n3\n\n7\n\nFig. 1.

For comparison, both the perturbative result, i.e., \u03b4\u03c9m (zA ) = \u0393m (zA ) = 0 (dashed lines) and\nthe results obtainable by only considering the effect of level\nshifting, i.e., \u0393m (zA ) = 0 (dotted lines) or only considering the\neffect of level broadening, i.e., \u03b4\u03c9m (zA ) = 0 (dash-dotted lines)\nare shown.\n\ncomponents as given by Eqs. (63)\u2013(65) are irrotational\nvectors (which is indeed the case for, e.g., an atom in the\npresence of planarly, spherically or cylindrically multilayered media), there may be situations where this is not\npossible, implying that Eqs. (63)\u2013(65) can not be derived\nfrom an energy expression in the way given by Eqs. (37)\nand (38) in principle.\nClearly, the above mentioned effects of level shifting\nand broadening can only become relevant when the atom\nis situated sufficiently close to a body surface. As already\nmentioned, when the frequency shifts and broadenings can\nbe neglected, \u03b4\u03c9m (rA ) \u2192 0, \u0393m (rA ) \u2192 0, then the dynamical result for the force components Fm (rA ) calculated by\nusing Eq.

If necessary, the level shifts could\nof course be easily introduced in the perturbative formulas by replacing the bare transition frequencies with the\nshifted ones [\u03c9mn 7\u2192 \u03c9\u0303mn (rA )]. On the contrary, introduction of the level broadening is not so straightforward.

Setting C4 = 0 in Eqs. (99) and (101), we\nobtain the asymptotic behaviour of the border curve in\nthe two limiting cases. The result shows that a repulsive vdW potential can be realized if \u03c7m (0)/\u03c7e (0) \u2265 23/7\n= 3.29 in the case of weak magnetodielectric properties,\nand \u03bc(0)/\u03b5(0) \u2265 5.11 (Z \u2265 2.26) in the case of strong magnetodielectric properties.\nApart from the different distance laws, the short-distance vdW potential, Eq. (93), differs from the long-distance potential, Eq. (91), in two respects. First, the relevant coefficients C3 and C1 are not only determined by the\nstatic values of the permittivity and the permeability, as is\nseen from Eqs. (94) and (95), and second, Eqs. (93)\u2013(95)\nreveal that electric and magnetic properties give rise to\npotentials with different distance laws and signs [C3 > 0\ndominant (and C1 > 0) if \u03b5 6= 1 and \u03bc = 1, while C3 = 0\nand C1 > 0 if \u03b5 = 1 and \u03bc 6= 1]. However, although for the\ncase of a purely magnetic plate a repulsive vdW potential\nproportional to 1/zA is predicted, in practice the attrac3\ntive 1/zA\nterm will always dominate for sufficiently small\nvalues of zA , because of the always existing electric properties of the plate. Hence when in the long-distance limit\nthe potential becomes repulsive due to sufficiently strong\nmagnetic properties, then the formation of a potential wall\nat intermediate distances becomes possible. It is evident\nthat with decreasing strength of the electric properties the\nmaximum of the wall is shifted to smaller distances while\nincreasing in height.\nIn the limiting case of weak electric properties, i.e.,\n\u03c9Pe /\u03c9Te \u226a 1 and \u03c9Pe /\u03c9Pm \u226a 1 [recall Eqs. (73) and (90)]\none can thus expect that the wall is situated within the\nshort-distance range, so that Eqs. (93)\u2013(95) can be used\nto determine both its position and height. From Eq.

So it is seen that for sufficiently large values of\n\u03c9Pm a potential wall begins to form and grows in height\nas \u03c9Pm increases.\nIn view of left-handed materials (cf. Refs. [37,38,42]),\nwhich simultaneously exhibit negative real parts of \u03b5(\u03c9)\nand \u03bc(\u03c9) within some (real) frequency interval such that\nthe real part of the refractive index becomes negative\ntherein, the question may arise whether these materials\nwould have an exceptional effect on the ground-state CP\nforce. The answer is obviously no, because the groundstate vdW potential as given by Eq. (87) together with\nEqs. (88) and (89) is expressed in terms of the always\npositive values of the permittivity and the permeability at\nimaginary frequencies. Clearly, the situation may change\nfor an atom prepared in an excited state. In such a case,\nthe vdW potential is essentially determined by the real\npart of the Green tensor [cf. Eqs. (65) and (67)]. When\nthere are transition frequencies that lie in frequency intervals where the material behaves left-handed, then particularities may occur.\n\nC1 \u2243\n\n2\n2\n)1/2 ].

(108)\nand (109)] for a two-level atom are shown in Fig. 5, revealing that for sufficiently strong magnetic properties the formation of a repulsive potential wall can also be observed\nfor a magnetodielectric plate of finite thickness. In the figure, the medium parameters correspond to those which\nhave already been found to support the formation of a\nrepulsive potential wall in the case of an infinitely thick\nplate. We see that the qualitative behaviour of the vdW\npotential is independent of the layer thickness. In particular, all curves in Fig. 5 feature a repulsive long-range\npotential that leads to a potential wall of finite height,\nthe potential becoming attractive at very short distances.\nHowever, the position and height of the wall are seen to\nvary with the thickness of the plate.

For small values of the thickness the potential\nheight is very small, it increases towards a maximum, and\nthen decreases asymptotically towards the value found for\nthe infinitely thick plate as the thickness is increased further towards very large values. It is worth noting that\nthere is an optimal plate thickness for creating a maximum\npotential wall. In this case the plate thickness is comparable to the position of the potential maximum-a case\nwhich is realized between the two extremes of infinitely\nthick and infinitely thin layer thickness.\nFurther insight can be gained by considering the two\nlimiting cases of an infinitely thick and an asymptotically\nthin plate. It is obvious that the integration in Eq. (87)\nis effectively limited by the exponential factor e\u22122bzA to\na circular region where b . 1/(2zA ).

Half space is abbreviated by h.s..\n\nin the case of a purely electric plate by two powers in the\natom-plate separation). Interestingly, a similar behaviour,\ni.e., the same hierarchy of power laws and the same signs\nhave been found for the vdW force between two atoms\n[31,32,33] and for the Casimir force between two semiinfinite half spaces [34]. This is illustrated in Tab. 1, where\nthe asymptotic power laws found for an atom interacting\nwith an infinitely thick plate, Eqs. (91) and (95), and an\nasymptotically thin plate, Eqs. (114) and (118), are summarized and compared to those valid for the interactions\nbetween two atoms or two half spaces, respectively.\nFor weak magnetodielectric properties, the similarity\nof the results displayed in Tab. 1 can be regarded as being\na consequence of the additivity of vdW-type interactions.\nIn fact, in this case (which for a gaseous medium of given\natomic species corresponds to a sufficiently dilute gas) all\nresults of the table can be derived from the vdW interaction of two single atoms via pairwise summation. The\nadditivity can explicitly be seen when comparing the result found for an asymptotically thin plate with that of an\ninfinitely thick plate in the case of weak magnetodielectric properties [\u03c7e (iu) \u2261 \u03b5(iu) \u22121 \u226a 1, \u03c7m (iu) \u2261 \u03bc(iu) \u2212 1\n\u226a 1].

(121) is not true in general. As\na consequence, the coefficients of the asymptotic power\nlaws in Tab. 1 can not be related to each other via simple\nadditivity arguments in general. However, we note from\nTab. 1 that the consideration of many-body corrections\nonly changes the coefficients of the asymptotic power laws,\nnot the power laws themselves.\n\n4.3 Planar cavity\nFinally, let us consider an atom placed within the simplest\ntype of planar cavity, i.e., between two identical infinitely\nthick magnetodielectric plates which are separated by a\ndistance d1 \u2261 s [n = 2, j = 1, \u03b51 (\u03c9) = \u03bc1 (\u03c9) \u2261 1, \u03b50 (\u03c9)\n= \u03b52 (\u03c9) \u2261 \u03b5(\u03c9), \u03bc0 (\u03c9) = \u03bc2 (\u03c9) \u2261 \u03bc(\u03c9)]. From Eqs. (78)\nand (79) it then follows that the reflection coefficients in\nEq.

(85) together with Eqs. (122) and\n(123) are plotted in Fig. 6. It is seen that the attractive\n(repulsive) potentials associated with each of two purely\nelectric (magnetic) plates combine to an infinite potential\nwall (well) at the center of the cavity. Hence, a potential well of finite depth at the center of the cavity can\nbe realized in the case of two genuinely magnetodielectric\nplates of sufficiently strong magnetic properties as shown\nin the figure. Provided that appropriate materials would\nbe available, this feature could in principle be used for the\ntrapping and guiding of atoms.\n\n\f14\n\nStefan Yoshi Buhmann et al.: Casimir-Polder interaction of atoms with magnetodielectric bodies\n\nplacements\n0.002\n3\nU0 (zA )12\u03c0 2 \u03b50 c3 /(\u03c910\n|d01 |2 )\n\n(c)\n(a)\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n\u22120.001\n\n\u22120.002\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nzA \u03c910 /c\n\n15\n\nFig. 6.

Thus the perturbative treatment may be justified for the purely off-resonant ground-state force, while\nbeing inadequate for the excited-state force containing resonant components (leaving aside its obvious inablity to describe the transient nature of excited-state components).\nFinally, we have applied the theory to analyze the competing effects of the electric and magnetic properties on\nthe CP force acting on a ground-state atom placed within\na magnetodielectric multilayer system, studying the corresponding vdW potential for the cases of thick and thin\nplates as well as a planar cavity. In close analogy to the\nvdW interaction between two atoms or the Casimir force\nbetween two plates, the electric and magnetic properties\ncompete in creating attractive and repulsive force components, respectively. In particular, if the atom interacts\nwith a magnetodielectric plate of sufficiently strong magnetic properties, a potential wall can be formed. We have\ngiven conditions for the creation of such a wall and shown\nthat there is an optimal plate thickness for maximizing the\nheight of the wall. Placing the atom between two magnetodielectric plates each of which giving rise to a potential\nwall, one can combine the two potentials to a potential\nwell. Needless to say that the thorough understanding of\nthe interplay of electric and magnetic material properties\ncan serve as a roadmap showing desirable directions of\nresearch in material design when aiming at shaping vdW\npotentials in a controlled way.\n\n5 Summary and Conclusions\nWithin the framework of exact macroscopic QED in linear, causal media, we have given a unified theory of the CP\nforce acting on an atom when placed near an arbitrary arrangement of dispersing and absorbing magnetodielectric\nbodies. We have considered both the familiar perturbative approach to the problem, where the atom-field coupling energy calculated in lowest-order perturbation theory is regarded as the potential associated with the CP\nforce acting on the atom prepared in an energy eigenstate,\nand a dynamical approach based on the Lorentz force averaged with respect to the body-assisted electromagnetic\nvacuum and the internal motion of the atom. In particular, the theory allows to extend the quantum mechanical\ncalculation of the interaction energy to the realistic case\nof material dispersion and absorption-a case for which\nstandard mode expansion of the electromagnetic field runs\ninto difficulties. So, the theory yields the vdW potential\nin terms of the electromagnetic-field scattering Green tensor and the lowest-order atomic polarizability in a natural\nmanner, without borrowing arguments from other theories\nsuch as the widely used linear response theory.\nIn contrast to the perturbative treatment of the CP\nforce, the dynamical treatment allows for including arbitrary excited atomic states, their temporal evolution and\nthus transient components of the force, and the influence\nof the body-induced shifting and broadening of the atomic\ntransitions on the force. Whereas level shifting can, at\nleast for very small atom-body distances, noticeably modify both the resonant and the off-resonant force components, level broadening effectively affects only the resonant\n\nWe thank J.
