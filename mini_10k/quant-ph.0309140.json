The traditional method involves photodetection on one output mode from a nondegenerate parametric downconversion process to postselect a single photon in the correlated mode [3]. More\nrecently alternative single-photon sources have been employed, including molecules [4], quantum wells [5], color\ncenters [6], ions [7] and quantum dots [8]. In these examples, the probability of more than one photon being produced is much lower than that for a Poissonian process,\nbut the vacuum contribution can be quite high. Under\nideal conditions, with a single mode output stable over\ntime, the output state can be described by the density\nmatrix\n\u03c1\u0302p = (1 \u2212 p)|0ih0| + p|1ih1|,\n\n(1)\n\nwith p the probability of obtaining a single photon; p is\nsometimes referred to as the efficiency for producing single photons. Whereas the theoretical single-photon state\ncorresponds to p = 1, the experimental single-photon\nstate is a mixture of the single photon with the vacuum.\nIncreasing the value of p (the efficiency of producing single photons) is an increasingly important objective because of requirements for quantum optics experiments, especially those concerned with quantum information processing. Much of this effort is directed to improving sources, but here we pose the question as to whether\na source of single photons with efficiency p can be processed via linear optics and photodetection to yield fewer\nphotons but with higher p. More specifically, would it be\npossible to direct N copies of these single photon states\nwith efficiency p into an N -channel passive interferometer (an interferometer that involves only passive, linear\noptical elements) to yield an output single photon with\n\nefficiency p\u2032 > p for certain photodetection records on\nthe other outputs? If the answer is yes, then interferometry and photodetection could be employed to improve\nthe efficiency of single-photon sources.\nIn fact the answer will be no, provided we consider\ndetection results where all but one of the photons are\ndetected. This is the most straightforward way of ensuring that the output state contains at most one photon. This restriction is necessary in most applications of\nlinear optics quantum information processing since twophoton contributions can have unwanted side effects, e.g.\nallowing for certain multiphoton attacks in quantum key\ndistribution applications. If we allow other detection\nresults, it is possible for low-efficiency (small p) singlephoton states to yield, via linear optics and conditional\npreparation based on photodetection, an output with a\nlarger probability for a single photon. However, these\nschemes also yield non-zero probabilities for photon numbers above one.\nA passive interferometer is comprised of beam splitters,\nmirrors, and phase shifters. Each of these elements preserves total photon number from input to output under\nideal conditions. No energy is required to operate these\noptical elements, hence the term passive. These are also\nknown as linear optical elements. More generally polarization transforming elements can be included, but here\nwe are concerned only with a scalar field treatment; in\nfact polarization effects could be included by doubling the\nnumber of channels and treating the two polarizations in\na mode as two separate channels. Mathematically, a passive interferometer transforms the amplitude operators\nof the incoming fields \u00e2 via the matrix transformation\n\u00e2\u2020 7\u2192 \u039bT \u00e2\u2020 with \u039b \u2208 U(N ) [9].\nIn the general case we start with a supply of N mixed\nstates of the form (1). For additional generality we allow the different inputs to have different probabilities for\n\n\f2\n\u03c1\u0302p1\n\nwhere |ni is a tensor product of number states in each of\nthe output modes.

We assume N\nincoming modes prepared in the state (2) with different pi .\n\n=\n\nPs\n\nk\n\nWithout loss of generality, we take mode 1 to be the\nmode in which we wish to improve the photon statistics.\nWe perform photodetections on the other N \u2212 1 modes,\nand examine the final state in mode 1 conditioned on\nthe results of these photodetections. The total number\nof photons detected is D, and the number of photons\ndetected in mode j is nj (see Fig. 1). It is easy to see\nthat no better result can be obtained by performing photodetections on fewer than N \u2212 1 modes; this would be\nequivalent to averaging over the photocounts for some of\nthe modes. We assume ideal photodetection in this analysis in order to determine the best results possible using\nlinear optics and photodetection.\nThe conditional state in mode 1 after photodetection\nin modes 2 to N is\n(N )\n\u03c1\u0302out\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\nn1 =0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere n1 is the photon number in the remaining output\nmode (rather than the number of photons detected at a\nphotodetector). Each coefficient cn1 is given by\n(N )\n\ncn1 = Khn|\u03c1\u0302trans |ni,\n\n(6)\n\nX\n\n2\n\ns;\u03a3s =\u03a3n\n\nPs |Ss,n | ,\n\n(7)\n\nX\n\n(5)\n\n\u039b1,\u03c31 * * * \u039b1,\u03c3n1\n\n\u0001\n\n(8)\n\nIn order to determine if there is an improvement in\nthe probability of finding a single photon, we need to\ndetermine the value of c1 . However, determining c1\nrequires evaluating K, which requires evaluating the\nexpectation values in Eq. (5) for all possible values of\nn1 . Instead, we will consider the ratio c1 /c0 . There are\nthree main advantages to considering this quantity:\n1. The common constant K \u2032 cancels, so this expression\nis easily evaluated analytically.\n2. If c1 /c0 is not greater than R \u2261 pmax /(1 \u2212 pmax ),\nthen it is clear that c1 \u2264 pmax . Thus we can determine\nthose cases where there is no improvement.\n3. For pmax \u226a 1, c0 \u2248 1 and R \u2248 pmax . Therefore the\nimprovement in c1 /c0 over R is approximately the same\nas the improvement in the probability of a single photon\nover pmax .\nIdeally, we would determine the interferometer and detection pattern such that c1 /c0 is maximized, but this\ndoes not appear to be possible analytically. However, we\ncan place an upper limit on c1 /c0 in the following way.\nLet us express the summation for c0 as\nc0 =\n\ncn1 |n1 ihn1 |,\n\n.\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n* * * \u039bN,\u03c3\u03a3n \u2212nN +1 * * * \u039bN,\u03c3\u03a3n .\n\n(2)\n\nQ\nwhere Ps = i psi i (1 \u2212 pi )1\u2212si , and the vector s =\n(s1 , * * * , sN )T , (si = 0, 1), gives the photon numbers\nin the inputs.

(5), we first\nintroduce\nsome notation. Let \u03a6s = {i|si = 1}, \u03a3s =\nP\ns\n(so\n\u03a3\ns is the number of elements in \u03a6s ), and let\ni i\nYs be the set that consists of all vectors comprised of the\nelements\nwe use the notation K \u2032 =\nQN of \u03a6s . In addition\nP\nK/ j=2 nj ! and \u03a3n = j nj . Using this notation, c1 is\ngiven by\n\nfinding a single photon, pi , and we denote the maximum\nof these probabilities by pmax . The initial state may be\nexpressed as\n(N )\n\u03c1\u0302in\n\n\"\n\nK\u2032\nN \u2212D\n\nX\n\nX\n\nPsk Ssk ,n\u2032\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\ns;\u03a3s =D+1 k;sk =1\n\nwhere ski = si except for skk = 0, and n\u2032j = nj except n\u20321 =\n0. The quotient of N \u2212 D takes account of a redundancy\nin the sum. Each alternative input sk has N \u2212 D zeros,\nso there are N \u2212 D possible alternative s that give the\nsame sk . We may reduce this quotient slightly if we take\naccount of the possibility that some of the inputs have\n\n\f3\nzero photon probability. Let there be N \u2212 M inputs with\npi = 0, so the maximum total number of photons is M .\nIf we limit the first sum in Eq. (9) to s such that Ps 6= 0,\nthen the redundancy is M \u2212 D.

Since we have limited the sum to\nterms where Ps 6= 0, pk is nonzero, and thus the ratio\n(1 \u2212 pk )/pk does not diverge. Since pk does not exceed\npmax , we have the inequality\nc0 \u2265\n\nK \u2032 1 \u2212 pmax\nM \u2212 D pmax\n\nX\n\nX\n\nPs\n\ns;\u03a3s =D+1\n\nk;sk =1\n\n2\n\n|Sk | .\n\n(11)\n\nHere we are able to omit the condition Ps 6= 0 because\nterms with Ps = 0 are zero anyway. We may re-express\nthe equation for c1 as\nc1 = K \u2032\n\nPs\n\ns;\u03a3s =D+1\n\nX\n\n\u039b1k Sk\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nk;sk =1\n\nWe therefore obtain\nc1 \u2264 K \u2032\n\nX\n\ns;\u03a3s =D+1\n\nPs\n\nX\n\nk;sk =1\n\n|Sk |2 .\n\n(13)\n\nCombining Eqs.

Here \u01eb is a small number, and we will ignore terms of order \u01eb or higher. Now let pi = pmax , and\nconsider the measurement record where zero photons are\ndetected in modes 3 to N , and D photons are detected\nin output mode 2. To determine cn1 , note first that\n\u039b22 \u226b \u039b2i for i 6= 2, so we may ignore those terms in the\nsum for Ss,n where \u039b22 does not appear. Each term has\nD\u22121\nmagnitude \u039bn111 \u039b22 \u039b21\n[11], and there are D(D+n1 \u22121)!\nsuch terms. Therefore, provided s2 = 1,\nD\u22121\nSs,n \u2248 D(D + n1 \u2212 1)!\u039bn111 \u039b22 \u039b21\n,\n\n\u01eb \u226a 1. (16)\n\u0001\nN \u22121\nIn the summation for cn1 , we have D\u2212n\ndifferent\n1 \u22121\ncombinations of inputs such that \u03a3s = D+n1 and s2 = 1.\nCombining these results, we have\nK \u2032 D+s1\n(1 \u2212 pmax )N \u2212D\u2212s1\np\nn1 ! max\n(N \u2212 1)!D2 (D + n1 \u2212 1)! 2n1 2 2D\u22122\n\u039b11 \u039b22 \u039b21\n\u00d7\n(N \u2212 D \u2212 n1 )!\n\u0012\n\u0013n1\nR\n(D + n1 \u2212 1)!\n\u2248 K \u2032\u2032\n,\n(17)\nN \u22121\nn1 !(N \u2212 D \u2212 n1 )!\n\ncn1 \u2248\n\n2\n\nX\n\nand (Sk ) to be as close to parallel as possible. For this,\nwe consider the interferometer given by\n\u221a\n\u039b21 = \u2212\u01eb, \u039b22 = 1 \u2212 \u01eb,\np\n\u221a\n\u039bi1 = (1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )/(N \u2212 1), \u039bi2 = \u01eb/ N \u2212 1,\n(15)\n\n(14)\n\nThis yields an upper limit on the ratio between the\none and zero photon probabilities. One application of\nthis result is that it is impossible to get one photon with\nunit probability, as it would be necessary for this ratio\nis infinite. Another consequence of (14) is that for D =\nM \u2212 1 (i.e. the number of photons detected one less the\nmaximum input number) an improvement can never be\nachieved. This case is important because it is the most\nstraightforward way of eliminating the possibility of two\nor more photons in the output mode.\nIn the remainder of this article, we will investigate situations in which the single-photon contribution can be\nenhanced. As M \u2264 N , and D \u2265 0, the upper limit on\nthe improvement in c1 /c0 is simply N . This is also the\nupper limit in how far c1 can be increased above pmax .\nWe will now consider a scheme that gives a linear improvement in c1 /c0 , though not as high as N . In order\nto obtain a large value for the ratio c1 /c0 , we want the\ninequality in Eq. (13) to be as close to equality as possible. In turn, this means that we want the vectors (\u039b1k )\n\nWe have combined those factors that do not depend\non\n\u221a\nn1 into a new constant K \u2032\u2032 , and used \u039b11 \u2248 1/ N \u2212 1.\nUsing Eq. (17) we find that\nc1\nD(N \u2212 D)\n\u2248R\n,\nc0\nN \u22121\n\n\u01eb \u226a 1.\n\n(18)\n\nThe maximum improvement in the ratio c1 /c0 is obtained\nfor D = \u2308N/2\u2309, where c1 /c0 = R\u230aN 2 /4\u230b/(N \u2212 1). The\nmultiplying factor \u230aN 2 /4\u230b/(N \u2212 1) is larger than 1 for\nall N \u2265 4. Thus we find that, provided there are at\nleast 4 modes, we may obtain an improvement in the\nratio c1 /c0 . For pmax \u226a 1, c1 \u2248 pmax \u230aN 2 /4\u230b/(N \u2212 1).\nFor large N , the probability of a single photon increases\napproximately as N/4. This is linear with N , but is not\nquite as large as the upper limit of N .\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to this interferometry scheme [i.e. using the interferometer (15)]. The first\ndrawback is the two-photon contribution. We find that\n(D + 1)(N \u2212 D \u2212 1)\nc2 /c1\n=\n,\nc1 /c0\n2D(N \u2212 D)\n\n(19)\n\nwhich, for D = \u2308N/2\u2309, is less than 1/2, but it is close\nto 1/2 for large N . Since this is the same ratio as for a\nPoisson distribution, this is equivalent to using a coherent\nstate. The two-photon contribution can be reduced by\nusing larger D, but this is at the expense of reducing c1 .\n\n\f4\nThe second drawback is that improvements are only\nobtained for small pmax . Although the improvement in\nthe ratio c1 /c0 is independent of pmax , improvements in\nc1 can only be obtained for values of pmax below 1/2.\nThat is, this method can only be used to obtain improvements in the probability of a single photon up to\n1/2, but not to make the probability of a single photon\narbitrarily close to 1. Note that the above method only\ngives c1 > pmax for four or more modes. We will now\nshow that it is impossible to obtain an improvement in\nthe probability of a single photon with fewer than four\nmodes, and for various combinations of detections with\nlarger numbers of modes.\nWe first examine the case D = 0. Then we have only\none term in the sum for c0 , and c0 = K \u2032 P0 . The expression for c1 becomes\nc1 = K\n\n\u2032\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\nN\nX\npk\n2\n2\n\u2032 pmax\nP0 |\u039b1k |\nP0 |\u039b1k | \u2264 K\n1 \u2212 pk\n1 \u2212 pmax\nk=1\n\n= K \u2032 RP0 = c0 R.\n\n(20)\n\nThus we have shown that c1 /c0 \u2264 R, so c1 \u2264 pmax . Hence\nthere can be no improvement in the photon statistics if\nzero photons are detected. We can also obtain a similar\nresult for the case D = 1, provided all the input pi are\nequal. In that case, we have\nX pmax\n2\nc0 = K \u2032\nP0 |\u039b2k | = K \u2032 RP0 .\n(21)\n1 \u2212 pmax\nk\n\nThe value of c1 is given by\nc1 =\n\n1 \u2032X X 2\n2\nK\nR P0 |\u039b1l \u039b2k + \u039b1k \u039b2l |\n2\nk l;l6=k\n\n\u2264\n\nIt is possible to obtain an improvement for more general\ndetection results, but at the expense of non-zero probabilities for two or more photons. We have not proven\nthat it is impossible to obtain an improvement in the\nprobability of a single photon while restricting to zero\nprobability for two or more photons; however, numerical\nsearches indicate that it is unlikely.\nThis work was funded in parts by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

(22)\n2\nk,l\n\nIn the last line we have used the fact that \u039b1k and \u039b2k\nare orthonormal. Thus we again find c1 /c0 \u2264 R, so c1 \u2264\npmax .\nThese results clearly eliminate the possibility of improving the probability of finding one photon with a twomode interferometer. We have shown that detecting zero\nphotons does not give an improvement, and if one photon\nis detected, then we must have M \u2212 D = 1 or 0, so there\nagain can be no improvement. Along the same lines we\ncan also eliminate the three-mode interferometer.\nWe have shown that it is impossible to improve the efficiency of a single-photon source by channeling more than\none low-efficiency single-photon state into a linear optic\ninterferometer and detecting all but one of the photons.\nThis eliminates the most straightforward scheme for obtaining an output state with no more than one photon.\n\n[1] G.
