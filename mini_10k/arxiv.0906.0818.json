Koll\u00e1r, Y. Miyaoka and S. Mori on rationally connected\nvarieties, it has been widely accepted that varieties with lots of rational\ncurves on them provide a good generalization of projective spaces. We fix\nk to be an algebraically closed field. In this paper, a variety over k is an\nintegral, separated, finite type k-scheme. We recall the following definitions,\nc.f.[dJSt], [Koll\u00e1r].\n\n1\n\n\fDefinition 1.1. Let X be a quasi-projective variety over k. A rational curve\non X is a nonconstant morphism \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 X. Let TX = H omOX (\u03a9X/k , OX )\nbe the tangent sheaf of X. If the image of \u03c6 is contained in the smooth locus\nX sm of X, then we can split \u03c6\u2217 TX into direct sum of line bundles\n\u03c6\u2217 TX \u223c\n=\n\nn\nX\n\nOP1 (ai ),\n\ni=1\n\nwhere n = dim X. We say that \u03c6 is free if Im(\u03c6) \u2282 X sm and ai \u2265 0, for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. We say that \u03c6 is very free if Im(\u03c6) \u2282 X sm and ai \u2265 1, for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. We say that X is separably uniruled if it has a free rational\ncurve and separably rationally connected (SRC) if it has a very free rational\ncurve. We say that X is rationally connected (RC) if there is a variety Y\nand a morphism u : P1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 X such that u(2) : P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 X\nis dominant. In this case we also say that a general pair of points on X are\nconnected by a rational curve.\nIn addition to these, we make the following\nDefinition 1.2. Let X be as above. We say that X is freely rationally\nconnected (FRC), if there is a variety Y and a morphism u : P1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 X\nsuch that u(2) : P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 X is dominant and in addition, each\nrational curve parametrized by Y is a free rational curve on X.\nIn general, SRC implies FRC and FRC implies RC. It turns out that over\nan algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, a smooth projective variety\nis RC if and only if it is SRC. However, these notions are not equivalent in\npositive characteristic. Namely, in [Koll\u00e1r] V.5.19, there is an example of a\nsmooth variety in characteristic p, which is FRC but not SRC. In [GHS], T.\nGraber, J. Harris and J. Starr prove that a rationally connected fibration\nover a curve admits a section in characteristic 0. In [dJSt], A.J. de Jong and\nJ. Starr generalize this result to characteristic p and the price they pay is\nthat they have to assume that a general fiber is SRC.\nIn this paper, we use the technique of foliations in positive characteristic\nto investigate the gap between the above notions. Our main theorem is the\nfollowing.\nTheorem 1.3. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Let\nX/k be a quasi-projective algebraic variety. Assume that X is freely rationally\n2\n\n\fconnected. Then there exists a separably rationally connected variety Y and a\nfinite purely inseparable morphism f : X \u2192 Y . If X is regular in codimension\n1 (or normal), then so is Y .\nWe sketch the main idea of the proof. First we use the free rational curves\non X to construct a canonical subsheaf D of TX . Then we prove that D is\nclosed under the Lie bracket and taking pth power if the characteristic is p.\nThis will be done in Section 2. This result holds in arbitrary characteristic\nand only relies on X being separably uniruled. In Section 3, we construct\nthe quotient of X by D and prove that the quotient is separably uniruled\n(resp. FRC) if X is so. As a result, if the quotient is not SRC, then we\nrepeat the construction above. In general, it is not guaranteed that this\nprocedure terminates with an SRC variety. In section 4, we investigate the\nrelation between the above procedure and the formal neighborhood of a free\nrational curve. In particular, we show that if the repeated construction does\nnot terminate with an SRC variety, then the global regular formal functions\nof the formal neighborhood of a free rational curve form a power series ring.\nIn section 5, we prove the main theorem by showing the fact that the FRC\ncondition will force the quotient procedure to terminate with an SRC variety.\nThen we give an application of the main theorem to prove the following\nGraber-Harris-Starr type theorem.\nTheorem 1.4. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 B be a proper flat family over a smooth curve\nB, here everything is over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p.\nAssume that the geometric generic fiber of X \u2192 B is normal and freely\nrationally connected. Then there is a morphism s : B \u2192 X such that\nd\nfor some d \u2265 0, where Fabs,B : B \u2192 B is the absolute Frobenius\n\u03c0 \u25e6 s = Fabs,B\nmorphism.\nAn interesting consequence of the above theorem is\nCorollary 1.5. Let X/k be a proper normal FRC variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p. Then X is simply connected.\nNamely, the algebraic fundamental group \u03c01 (X) is trivial.\nAcknowledgement: The author would like to thank his advisor, Aise\nJohan de Jong, without whose careful and patient instruction, the author\nwould not have been able to carry out this research. Many thanks to the\nreferee who pointed out that FRC should imply simply connectedness.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nThe Foliation\n\nIn this section we will fix the following notations. Let X/k be a quasiprojective algebraic variety of dimension n over k (of arbitrary characteristic,\nbut we will focus on positive characteristic later). Assume that X is separably\nuniruled. Then there is a free rational curve \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 X such that\n\u03c6 TX \u223c\n=\n\u2217\n\nr\nX\n\nOP1 (ai )\n\nM\n\nOPn\u2212r\n1 ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ai > 0 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\n\nP\nDefinition 2.1. The distinguished subsheaf ri=1 OP1 (ai ) of \u03c6\u2217 TX will be\ndenoted by Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX ). The positive rank of X is defined to be the largest\nnumber r such that r = rank(Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX )) for some free rational curve \u03c6 on\nX. A free rational curve \u03c6 is said to be maximally free if Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX ) has\nrank equal to the positive rank r of X. We use Homm.free (P1 , X) to denote\nthe open subscheme of Homfree (P1 , X) that parametrizes all maximally free\nrational curves on X. Let Um be the open subvariety of X defined by the\nimage of P1 \u00d7 Homm.free(P1 , X) \u2192 X.\nProposition 2.2. Let X be as above, then for each closed point x : Spec(k) \u2192\nUm , there is a well defined subspace D(x) of x\u2217 TX = TX,x \u2297 k(x) such that\nfor every maximally free rational curve \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 X through which x factors\nas\ni\n/ P1 \u03c6 / X\nSpec(k)\nwe always have i\u2217 Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX ) = D(x) \u2282 x\u2217 TX .\nProof. Let \u03c61 and \u03c62 be two maximally free rational curves with \u03c61 (0) =\n\u03c62 (0) = x. So we have the following diagram\nSpec(k)\nH\n\nC1\n\nv\ni1 vvv\nv\nv\nv\nv{ v\n\u03c61\n\n/\n\nx\n\n\u000f\n\nXo\n\nHH i\nHH2\nHH\nHH\n#\n\u03c62\n\nC2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are two P1 's, with i1 and i2 being the inclusions of the two\norigins. We need to show that i\u22171 Pos(\u03c6\u22171 TX ) = i\u22172 Pos(\u03c6\u22172 TX ) as subspaces of\nx\u2217 TX . We glue C1 and C2 at the origins and get a nodal curve C and a\n4\n\n\fmorphism \u03c6 : C \u2192 X. We will prove that the deformation of C is unobstructed and a general deformation of C is a free rational curve \u03c6. Assume\nthat i\u22171 Pos(\u03c6\u22171 TX ) 6= i\u22172 Pos(\u03c6\u22172 TX ), then we will show that Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX ) has rank\n> r and this is a contradiction.\nLet F : (Sch/k)\u25e6 \u2192 (Set) be the deformation functor defined in the\nfollowing way: F (S) consists of isomorphism classes of diagrams\nf\n\nC\n\n/X\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nS\nwhere \u03c0 is a proper flat family of at worst nodal curves of genus 0 over the\nscheme S. Hence we can view \u03c6 : C \u2192 X as an element in F (Spec(k)). The\n/0}\n/ \u03a9C/k\ncotangent complex of \u03c6, L\u2217\u03c6 , is the complex { 0 / \u03c6\u2217 \u03a9X/k\nwith the \u03a9C/k term having degree 0. The first order deformation of \u03c6 is\ngiven by Ext1OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC ) and the obstruction space lives in Ext2OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC ),\n[CKa] [LTi]. The spectral sequence for hyper-extension groups gives the\nfollowing long exact sequence\n0\n\n/\n\nExt0OC (\u03a9C/k , OC )\n/\n\nExt0OC (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a9X/k , OC )\n\n/\n\nExt1OC (\u03a9C/k , OC )\n/\n\nExt1OC (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a9X/k , OC )\n\n/\n\nExt2OC (\u03a9C/k , OC )\n\nExt0OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC )\n/\n\n/\n\nExt1OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC )\n\n/\n\nExt2OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC )\n\n\u03c1\n\n/\n\nExt2OC (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a9X/k , OC ) = 0\n(1)\n\nLemma 2.3. ([DM]) The following are true:\n(i) Ext2OC (\u03a9C/k , OC ) = 0,\n(ii) Ext1OC (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a9X/k , OC ) = H1 (C, \u03c6\u2217TX ) = 0\nFrom the above lemma and the hyper-extension spectral sequence (1), we\nget that Ext2OC (L\u2217\u03c6 , OC ) = 0 and hence the deformation of \u03c6 is unobstructed.\nLet\nC\n\ni\n\n/\n\nf\n\nC\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nb0\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n5\n\n/X\n\n\fbe a deformation of \u03c6 over a smooth curve B, i.e. f \u25e6 i = \u03c6.\nLemma 2.4. We can choose (C /B, f ) such that\n(i) a general fiber of \u03c0 is a smooth rational curve.\n(ii) f |Cb is a free rational curve for general b \u2208 B(k).\nTo prove (i), we first consider the deformation of C as a k-scheme;\nthe first order deformation is Ext1OC (\u03a9C/k , OC ) and the obstruction lives in\nExt2OC (\u03a9C/k , OC ) = 0. The local-global spectral sequence gives\n0\n\n/\n\nH1 (C, H om(\u03a9C , OC ))\n\nExt1OC (\u03a9C , OC )\n/\n\n/ H0 (C, E xt1\n\nOC (\u03a9C , OC ))\n\n/\n\nH2 (C, H omOC (\u03a9C , OC )) = 0\n\nNote that H0 (C, E xt1OC (\u03a9C , OC )) classifies first order local deformations and\nExt1OC (\u03a9C , OC ) classifies all first order (global) deformations of C/k. Hence\nall local deformations of C/k come from global deformations. By embedding\nC into P2 and using the exact sequence\n0\n\n/\n\nI /I 2\n/\n\n\u03a9P2 |C\n/\n\n\u03a9C\n/\n\n0,\n\n(2)\n\nto do local computation, we find that E xt1OC (\u03a9C , OC ) = k(P ) where P\nis the node of C and it follows that H0 (C, E xt1OC (\u03a9C , OC )) = k. Actually, one can compute all the formal local deformations explicitly. Let R =\nk[[X, Y ]]/(XY ), all deformations of R/k to k[\u01eb] are given by\n{k[\u01eb][[X, Y ]]/(XY \u2212 \u03bb\u01eb) : \u03bb \u2208 k} .\nThis means that there exist local deformations that smooth out the node\nand hence there exist deformations of C/k that smooth out the node. In the\nsequence (1), the surjectivity of \u03c1 says that all deformations of C/k comes\nfrom deformations of \u03c6 : C/k \u2192 X by forgetting the morphism to X. Thus\nthere is a deformation, (C /B, f ), of \u03c6 : C/k \u2192 X smoothing out the node\nof C. This proves (i) of the Lemma.\nTo prove (ii), we consider the locally free sheaf f \u2217 TX on C . First, by\nshrinking B and replacing B by a finite \u00e9tale cover, we may assume that\nC /B has a section \u03c3 passing through a smooth point of C = Cb0 . So \u03c3\n6\n\n\fdefines a horizontal divisor D on C . Let E = f \u2217 TX (\u2212D) and we have the\nfollowing short exact sequence\n/\n\n0\n\nE |C\n\n/ j1\u2217 (E |C\n\n1\n\n) \u2295 j2\u2217 (E |C2 )\n/\n\nE (P )\n/\n\n0,\n\nwhere P is the nodal point of C and j1 : C1 \u2192 C and j2 : C2 \u2192 C are the\ninclusions. The associated long exact sequence is\n\u03b1\n\nH0 (C1 , E |C1 ) \u2295 H0 (C2 , E |C2 )\nH1 (C, E |C )\n\n/\n\n/\n\nE (P ) = EP \u2297 k(P )\n/\n\nH1 (C1 , E |C1 ) \u2295 H1 (C2 , E |C2 ) = 0\n\nwhere the last term is 0 since C1 and C2 are free and \u03b1 is surjective since\none of E |C1 and E |C2 is globally generated. It follows that H1 (C, E |C ) = 0.\nBy semicontinuity theorem [Hart] III.12, we get H1 (Cb , E |Cb ) = 0 for general\nb \u2208 B(k). Since E |Cb = fb\u2217 TX (\u22121), we know that fb is free and this proves\n(ii).\nNow we are ready to prove that for a general deformation fb : Cb \u2192 X, the\npositive part of fb\u2217 TX has rank > r under the assumption that i\u22171 Pos(\u03c6\u22171 TX ) 6=\ni\u22172 Pos(\u03c6\u22172 TX ). We may assume that C /B has two horizontal divisors D1 and\nD2 corresponding to sections \u03c3i passing through a point of Ci not equal to\nP . Let E = f \u2217 TX (\u2212D1 \u2212 D2 ), F = E |Cb0 , F1 = F |C1 and F2 = F |C2 , then\nwe have the following short exact sequence,\n/\n\n0\n\n/\n\nF\n\ni1\u2217 F1 \u2295 i2\u2217 F2\n/\n\nF (P ) = FP \u2297 k(P )\n/\n\n0.\n\nThe induced long exact sequence is\n0\n\n/\n\n\u03b2\n\nH0 (C, F )\n\n/\n\n/\n\nH0 (C1 , F1 ) \u2295 H0 (C2 , F2 )\n\nTX (P )\n/\n\nH1 (C, F )\n/\n\n.\n\n0\n\nNote that Im(\u03b2) is the subspace spanned by Pos(\u03c6\u22171 TX )(P ) and Pos(\u03c6\u22172 TX )(P ),\nwhich has dimension > r by assumption. It follows that dim H1 (C, F ) = n\u2212\ndim(Im(\u03b2)) < n \u2212 r. By semicontinuity again, we have H1 (Cb , E |Cb ) < n \u2212 r.\nSince E |Cb = fb\u2217 TX \u2297 O(\u22122) by construction, the positive part of fb\u2217 TX has\nrank greater than r. \u0003\n\n7\n\n\fThis proposition implies that we can define D(x), for each point x \u2208\nUm (k), to be the subspace i\u2217 Pos(\u03c6\u2217 TX ) of x\u2217 TX , where \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 X is a\nmaximally free rational curve with \u03c6(0) = x, and i : Spec(k) \u2192 P1 is the\ninclusion of the origin.\n1\n\n; P @@\nvv\n@@ \u03c6\ni vvv\n@@\nvv\n@@\nv\nv\n\u001f\nx\n/X\nSpec(k)\n\nNext, we will use faithfully flat descent technique to glue all the D(x) together\nto get a sub-bundle of TX on some open set.\nProposition 2.5. There is a nonempty open subset \u0168 \u2282 Um such that\n{D(x) : x \u2208 \u0168 (k)} glue together to give a subbundle D of TX |\u0168 , i.e. x\u2217 D =\nD(x), for all x \u2208 \u0168(k).\nProof. It is known that the universal morphism F : P1 \u00d7Homm.free (P1 , X) \u2192\nX is smooth, [Koll\u00e1r] II.3. Take a connected open subset W \u2282 Homm.free (P1 , X).\nConsider the smooth morphism \u03c0 : P1 \u00d7 W \u2192 X, in particular, \u03c0 is flat.\nBy shrinking W , we may assume that \u03c0 \u2217 TX splits uniformly as \u03c0 \u2217 TX =\nP\nr\nn\u2212r\nwhere O = OP1W and ai > 0. Denote the distinguished\ni=0 O(ai ) \u2295 O\nPr\nsub-bundle i=1 O(ai ) of \u03c0 \u2217 TX by V . Let \u0168 \u2282 X be the image of \u03c0. By\nconstruction, we have \u0168 \u2282 Um . Then \u03c0 : P1 \u00d7 W \u2192 \u0168 is faithfully flat.\nNext, we want to construct descent data on V from that of \u03c0 \u2217 TX . To do\nthis, we denote P1 \u00d7 W by Z; Z \u00d7\u03c0 Z by Z (2) with projections p1 and p2 ;\nZ \u00d7\u03c0 Z \u00d7\u03c0 Z by Z (3) with projections pij , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 3. Let \u03c01 = \u03c0 : Z \u2192 \u0168 ,\n\u03c02 : Z (2) \u2192 \u0168 and \u03c03 : Z (3) \u2192 \u0168 be the obvious morphisms. First, we want\nto construct an isomorphism \u03c6 : p\u22171 V \u2192 p\u22172 V in the following way. Note\nthat both p\u22171 V and p\u22172 V can be viewed as sub-bundles of \u03c02\u2217 TX that are local\ndirect summands and by construction of V and {D(x)}, we have\np\u22171 V \u2297 k(z) = p\u22172 V \u2297 k(z),\n\nfor all closed points z \u2208 Z\u0303 (2)\n\n(3)\n\nas subspaces of \u03c02\u2217 TX \u2297 k(z). Since Z (2) is smooth and hence reduced, the\ncondition (3) implies that p\u22171 V = p\u22172 V as sub-bundles of \u03c02\u2217 TX by Hilbert\nNullstellensatz([Hart], I.1). We define \u03c6 to be the identification. Our next\nstep is to show that this isomorphism \u03c6 satisfies the cocycle condition, c.f.\n[BLR] Chapter 6,\np\u221713 \u03c6 = p\u221723 \u03c6 \u25e6 p\u221712 \u03c6\n(4)\n8\n\n\fTo be more precise, we need to show that the following diagram is commutative\np\u2217 \u03c6\np\u2217 \u03c6\np\u221712 p\u22171 V 12 / p\u221712 p\u22172 V id / p\u221723 p\u22171 V 23 / p\u221723 p\u22172 V\nid\n\nid\n\n\u000f\n\np\u221713 \u03c6\n\np\u221713 p\u22171 V\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\np\u221713 p\u22172 V\n\nAll the above terms, as sub-bundles of \u03c03\u2217 TX , are the same. Note that p\u221713 \u03c6 \u2212\np\u221723 \u03c6 \u25e6 p\u221712 \u03c6, as a morphism from p\u221713 p\u22171 V to p\u221713 p\u22172 V , reduces to 0 on fibers and\nhence is 0 by Hilbert Nullstellensatz. This shows the cocycle condition. By\nconstruction, the inclusion V \u0592\u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 TX is compatible with the descent data\nconstructed on V and the canonical one on \u03c0 \u2217 TX . Hence by faithfully flat\ndescent we conclude that there is a sub-bundle D of TX |\u0168 with V = \u03c0 \u2217 D \u0592\u2192\n\u03c0 \u2217 TX . \u0003\nRemark: In general, let X be a noetherian scheme and E be a coherent OX -module. Let F be a submodule of E |U where U \u2282 X is a\ndense open subscheme. Then it is a standard fact that there is a maximal submodule F \u0303 of E which extends F . Actually, we can define F \u0303 by\n\u0393(V, F \u0303 ) = {s \u2208 \u0393(V, E ) : s|V \u2229U \u2208 \u0393(V \u2229 U, F )}. In addition, if X is integral and F \u2282 E |U is saturated, then F \u0303 is a saturated submodule of E that\nextends F . Hence, in our situation, there is a canonically defined saturated\nsubsheaf, still denoted by D, of TX whose restriction to \u0168 is the subbundle\nconstructed in the above proposition. From now on, we will always use D or\nDX to denote this canonical subsheaf of TX .\nProposition 2.6. The subsheaf D satisfies the following two properties.\n(i) [D, D] \u2286 D, i.e. D is closed under the Lie Bracket.\n(ii) D p \u2286 D, i.e. D is closed under taking pth power if k is of characteristic\np.\nProof. We use the same notions as in the previous proof. Consider the\nfollowing diagram\nD \u2297k DM\n\n[\u2212,\u2212]\n\n/\n\nMMM\nMMM\nMMM\nM&\n\nTX\n\n/ TX /D\n8\nr\nrr\nr\nr\nrr\u03c1\nrrr\n\nD \u2297OX D\n\n9\n\n,\n\n\fwhere \u03c1 is OX -linear. Pullback \u03c1 by the faithfully flat map \u03c0 we get\nM\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c1 : \u03c0 \u2217 (D \u2297OX D) =\nO(ai + aj ) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 (TX /D) = On\u2212r\ni,j\n\nSince ai > 0, we know that \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c1 = 0 and hence \u03c1|\u0168 = 0. Since TX /D is torsion\nfree, we get \u03c1 = 0. This proves (i). Now assume that k is of characteristic p\nand consider the following composition \u033a\n\u033a: D\n\n(\u2212)p\n\n/\n\nTX\n\nTX /D .\n/\n\nIt is known that \u033a is p-linear, i.e. \u033a(f D) = f p \u033a(D) where f \u2208 OX , if D is\nclosed under Lie bracket, [Katz]. This defines an OX -linear morphism \u033a\u2032 =\n\u2217\n1\u2297\u033a : Fabs,X\nD \u2192 TX /D, where Fabs,X is the absolute Frobenius morphism of\n\u2217\n\u2217\nX. If we pull the diagram back via \u03c0 and note that \u03c0 \u2217 Fabs,X\nD = Fabs,Z\n\u03c0\u2217D\n\u2217\nand Fabs,Z O(a) = O(pa), we get\n\u2217 \u2032\n\n\u03c0 \u033a :\u03c0\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n(Fabs,X\nD)\n\n=\n\nr\nM\n\nO(pai ) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 (TX /D) = On\u2212r .\n\ni=1\n\nThen \u03c0 \u2217 \u033a\u2032 has to be 0 and hence \u033a\u2032 = 0. This proves (ii). \u0003\n\n3\n\nThe Quotient\n\nIn this section, we assume that k is of characteristic p. Let X/k be a separably\nuniruled variety. Let r be the positive rank of X. We apply the results from\nthe previous section and define the foliation D on X. We define a sheaf of\nk-algebras A \u0592\u2192 OX by\n\u0393(V, A ) = {f \u2208 \u0393(V, OX )|Df = 0, \u2200D \u2208 \u0393(V0 , D), \u2200 open V0 \u2282 V }\nNote that we have the following inclusions\nOX\n\n(\u2212)p\n\n/\n\nA\n\n/\n\nOX .\n\nIn this way, A can be viewed as a sheaf of OX -algebras.

In this case, the exact sequence (8) splits\ncanonically on some nonempty open set \u0168 that contains a maximally free\nrational curve.\n(b) If X is FRC then so is Y .\nProof. For (a), we only need to prove that the exact sequence (8) splits\ncanonically in the \"Splitting case\". The above Lemma (3.3) shows that in the\n\"Splitting case\" \u03c6\u0303\u2217 TY has the same splitting type as \u03c6\u2217 TX , for all maximally\nfree rational curves \u03c6. Then we know that the pull-back via \u03c6\u0303 of the exact\nsequence (8) has a unique splitting which identifies \u03c6\u0303\u2217 (g \u2217 \u03c3 \u2217 D) as the subbundle \u03c6\u0303\u2217 DY of \u03c6\u0303\u2217 TY , where DY is the foliation on Y as constructed in the\nprevious section.

This proves that the exact sequence (8) splits canonically on \u0168 . To\nprove (b), we only need to use the fact that f : X \u2192 Y is dominant. \u0003\nProposition (3.4) enables us to repeat the construction of foliation on\nthe quotients and we will get a sequence, which will be called the quotient\nsequence of X.\nX\n\nf\n\n/\n\nY1\n\nf1\n\n/\n\nY2\n\nf2\n\n/\n\nY3\n\nf3\n\n/\n\n***\n\nCorollary 3.5.

Notation as in the previous lemma and we further assume that\nX \u2192 Y is of \"splitting case\". If \u03b1d is surjective (resp. isomorphism) and\n\u03b4\u0303d = 0 in the diagram (15) then \u03b1d+1 is also surjective (resp. isomorphism)\nand \u03b4d = 0.\nProof. First we claim that in the splitting case H 0(Symd (\u03b8)) is an isomorphism for all d \u2265 1. By Lemma (4.3), we have I /I 2 \u223c\n= On\u2212r \u2295 N and\nI \u0303/I \u03032 \u223c\n= On\u2212r \u2295 N \u0303 where N and N \u0303 are direct sums of line bundles of negative degrees. From the diagram (13) we see that the sheaf homomorphism\n\u03b8 maps On\u2212r \u2282 I \u0303/I \u03032 isomorphically to On\u2212r \u2282 F\u2217 (On\u2212r ) \u2282 F\u2217 (I /I 2 )\nand is zero on N \u0303. Then it is easy to see that I d /I d+1 \u223c\n= Symd (I /I 2 ) \u223c\n=\nd\nn\u2212r\nd\n2\nd\nn\u2212r\nd\nd+1\n\u223c\n\u223c\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\nSym (O ) \u2295 Nd and I /I\n= Sym (I /I ) = Sym (O ) \u2295 N \u0303d\n \u0303\nwhere Nd and Nd are direct sums of line bundles of negative degrees. Hence\nthe sheaf homomorphism Symd (\u03b8) factors as I \u0303d /I \u0303d+1 \u0589 Symd (On\u2212r ) \u0592\u2192\nF\u2217 (Symd (On\u2212r )) \u2282 F\u2217 (I d /I d+1 ). Note that here we identify a sheaf F on\nP1 with F\u2217 (F ). Then it is easy to see that H 0 (Symd(\u03b8)) is an isomorphism\nfor all d \u2265 1. Then the Lemma is an easy diagram chasing in (15). \u0003\nNow we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section.\nTheorem 4.7. Let X/k be an n dimensional uniruled algebraic variety over\nan algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. Assume that the quotient sequence (10) of X has \"splitting case\" in each step. Let \u03c6 = \u03c60 : P1 \u2192\nX be a maximally free rational curve on X, which is a closed immersion,\nand \u03c6i be the induced one on Yi . Let X = X/P1 be the formal neighborhood\nof \u03c6 in X and Yi = Yi/P1 be the formal neighborhood of \u03c6i in Yi . Then\n(a)\u0393(Yi+1 , OYi+1 ) \u2192 \u0393(Yi , OYi ) is an isomorphism for all i \u2265 0, where\nY0 = X.\n(b)\u0393(X, OX) \u223c\n= k[[t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r ]] is a formal power series ring of n\u2212r variables,\nwhere r is the positive rank of X.\nProof. Let Ii be the ideal sheaf on Yi that defines \u03c6i as a closed subvariety of Yi , for i = 0, 1, * * * , here Y0 = X and \u03c60 = \u03c6; we also write I0 as I .\nd+1\nOur first claim is that \u03c0i,d : H0 (P1 , OYi /Iid+1 ) \u2192 H0 (P1 , OYi\u22121 /Ii\u22121\n) is iso0\n1\nmorphism for all i \u2265 1, d \u2265 0. To prove this, we let \u03b4i,d : H (P , OYi /Iid ) \u2192\nH1 (P1 , Iid /Iid+1 ) be the connection map and let \u03c1i,d : H0 (OYi /Iid+1 ) \u2192\n\n18\n\n\fH0 (OYi /Iid ). Consider the following diagram\nd\nH0 (OYi\u22121 /Ii\u22121\n)o\n\n\u03c0i,d\u22121\n\nH0 (OYO i /Iid ) o\n\nO\n\nd\nH0 (OYi+1 /Ii+1\n)\n\n\u03c1i,d\n\n\u03c1i\u22121,d\n\nH0 (OYi\u22121 /Iid+1 ) o\n\n\u03c0i+1,d\u22121\n\n\u03c0i,d\n\nH0 (OYi /Iid+1 )\n\nIf both \u03c0i,d\u22121 and \u03c0i+1,d\u22121 are isomorphisms, then so is \u03c0i,d . To see this, note\nthat surjectivity of \u03c0i+1,d\u22121 implies that \u03b4i,d = 0 by Lemma(4.5); and then\nwe get that \u03c0i,d is isomorphism by Lemma(4.6). Now, we can easily see that\n\u03c0i,0 : H0 (P1 , OYi /Ii ) \u223c\n= k is isomorphism for all\n= k \u2192 H0 (P1 , OYi\u22121 /Ii\u22121 ) \u223c\ni = 1, 2, * * * , hence all the \u03c0i,d 's are isomorphisms and all the \u03b4i,d 's are 0.\nThis proves (a). To prove (b), we first note that H0 (P1 , I /I 2 ) is an n \u2212 r\ndimensional k-vector space, say Spank {\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n\u2212r }, and it is a subspace of\nH0 (P1 , OX /I 2 ). Each \u03b1i lifts to a formal element \u03b1\u0302i \u2208 H0 (X, OX) and this\ndefines a ring homomorphism\n\u03c8 : k[[t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r ]] \u2192 H0 (X, OX),\n\nti 7\u2192 \u03b1\u0302i .\n\nTo prove that \u03c8 is an isomorphism, we consider the following diagram\n0\n/\n\nH0 (I d /I d+1 )\n/\n\nO\n\nH0 (OX /I d+1 )\n\u03c8d+1\n\n\u03bbd\n\n0\n\n/\n\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d+1\n\n/\n\nO\n\n/\n\nk[[t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r ]]\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d+1\n\nH0 (OX /I d )\nO\n\n0\n/\n\n/\n\n\u03c8d\n\nk[[t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r ]]\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d\n/\n\n0\n\nand note that \u03bbd factors through\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d\n\u2192 Symd(H0 (I /I 2 )) \u2192 H0 (Symd(I /I 2 )) \u2192 H0 (I d /I d+1 )\n(t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r )d+1\nand all these are isomorphisms and hence so is \u03bbd . Then we prove that \u03c8d is\nisomorphism for all d by induction since \u03c81 is isomorphism. This shows that\n\u03c8 is an isomorphism. \u0003\nRemark: This theorem shows that there is a morphism of formal schemes\n\u03c8 : X \u2192 Spf(k[[t1 , . . . , tn\u2212r ]]). Then a natural question is: Can we make\na\n\n19\n\n\fthis \u03c8 a algebraic? The author expects that there is an \u00e9tale neighborhood\nU of P1 in X, i.e.\n/U\n/X\nP1\nsuch that, there is a morphism U \u2192 An\u2212r that induces \u03c8 a . This is in the\nspirit of Artin's approximation theorem, c.f.[Art] [CdJ].\n\n5\n\nProof of Main Theorem\n\nIn this section we prove our main theorem and give an application to the\nGraber-Harris-Starr type theorem.\nTheorem 5.1. (Main Theorem) Let X/k be a quasi-projective variety\nover an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. Assume that X\nis freely rationally connected. Then there is a separably rationally connected\nvariety Y and a finite purely inseparable morphism f : X \u2192 Y . If X is\nregular in codimension 1 (or normal), then so is Y .\nProof. We want to produce the variety Y by repeating taking quotients\nby the foliation; By Lemma(3.5), we will get a separably rationally connected\nvariety after finitely many steps if the \"splitting case\" does not appear infinitely many times. Then the regularity in codimension 1 (or normality) of\nY follows from Corollary (3.2). So the proof of the main theorem reduces to\nthe following\nClaim: Let X be a separably uniruled variety over k. If the quotient\nsequence (10) has \"splitting case\" in each step, then X is not freely rationally\nconnected.\nBy contradiction, we assume that X is FRC, i.e., there exists a family of\nmaximally free rational curves \u03c6 : P1 \u00d7W \u2192 X such that \u03c6(2) : P1 \u00d7P1 \u00d7W \u2192\nX (2) = X \u00d7 X is dominant. First, we put the extra assumption that each\nrational curve in this family is a closed immersion. The fact that \u03c6(2) being\ndominant implies that there is a family of maximally free rational curves\n\u03c60 : P1 \u00d7 W0 \u2192 X such that \u03c60 is dominant and \u03c60 (0 \u00d7 W0 ) = x0 \u2208 X(k).\nActually, we can just consider the following morphism h\nh : P1 \u00d7 PGL2 \u00d7 W\n\n/ P1\n\n\u00d7 P1 \u00d7 W\n\n20\n\n\u03c6(2)\n\n/\n\nX (2)\n\n\fwith h : (t, g, [\u03c6]) 7\u2192 (\u03c6(g(0)), \u03c6(t)). Take W\u03030 to be h\u22121 (x0 \u00d7 X).\nP1 \u00d7 PGL2 \u00d7 W\n/\n\nW\u03030\nh0\n\nh\n\n\u000f\n\nx0 \u00d7 X\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nX \u00d7X\n\nBy definition, h is dominant and hence h0 is also dominant if we choose\nx0 \u2208 X general enough. Then the following morphism is also dominant\nh\u03030 : P1 \u00d7 W\u03030 \u2192 X,\n\n(s, (t, g, [\u03c6])) 7\u2192 \u03c6(g(s)).\n\nBy construction, we have h\u03030 (0 \u00d7 W\u03030 ) = x0 . Then we choose W0 to be some\ncomponent of W\u03030 and get a dominant morphism \u03c60 : P1 \u00d7 W0 \u2192 X such\nthat \u03c60 (0 \u00d7 W0 ) = x0 \u2208 X(k). We denote P1 \u00d7 W0 by Z. Since \u03c60 is\ndominant, there is a closed point z = (u, [\u03c6]) \u2208 Z such that OX,x \u0592\u2192 OZ,z\nand hence \u00d4X,x \u0592\u2192 \u00d4Z,z , where x = \u03c60 (z). Let X = X/\u03c6(P1 ) and Z = Z/P1 \u00d7[\u03c6] .\nThen we have an induced morphism of formal schemes \u03c8 : Z \u2192 X. By\nTheorem(4.7), we have \u0393(X, OX) = k[[t1 , * * * , tn\u2212r ]] and it is easy to see that\n\u0393(Z, OZ) = \u00d4W0 ,[\u03c6] . Now consider the following diagram\n\u0393(X, OX))\n\n\u03c8\u2217\n\n/\n\nr2\n\nr1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u00d4X,x\n\n(16)\n\n\u0393(Z, OZ)\n\n\u03c8z\u2217\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u00d4Z,z\n\n/\n\n\u02c6 \u00d4W0 ,[\u03c6]\n\u00d4P1 ,u \u2297\n\nwhere the vertical maps are injective and \u03c8z\u2217 is also injective. So \u03c8 \u2217 must be\ninjective. But we can show that \u03c8 \u2217 (ti ) = 0. Indeed, the following factorization\nSpec(k)\nG\n9\nr\nrrr\nr\nr\nr\nrrr\n/ P1\n0 \u00d7 W0\n\nGG\nGGx0\nGG\nGG\nG#\n/X\n\u00d7W\n0\n\n\u2217\n\ngives a factorization of r2 \u25e6 \u03c8 as follows\nq8 k OOOO\nOOO\nqqq\nq\nq\nOOO\nqq\nq\nOOO\nq\n'\nqqq\n/ \u00d4\n/ \u0393(Z, OZ)\n\u0393(X, OX)\nx\u22170\n\n0\u00d7W0 ,(0,[\u03c6])\n\n21\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n/ \u00d4\n\nW0 ,[\u03c6]\n\n/\n\n\u00d4Z,z\n\n\fIn the above diagram x\u22170 (ti ) = 0 since x0 \u2208 \u03c6(P1 ); this gives a contradiction.\nIn the case where there is no maximally free rational curve on X that is\na closed immersion, we can find some integer m > 1, such that there is a\nmaximally free rational curve \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u00d7 \u03c62 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 \u03c6m on X (m) = X \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 X\nwhich is a closed immersion, where each \u03c6i is a maximally free rational curve\non X for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. It is also easy to see that all maximally free rational\ncurves on X (m) are of the above form. Let D (m) := p\u22171 D \u2295 * * * \u2295 p\u2217m D. Since\nPos(\u03c6\u2217 (TX (m) )) = \u03c6\u2217 (D (m) ) for all maximally free rational curves \u03c6 on X (m)\nand D (m) \u2282 TX (m) is saturated, we see that the canonical foliation on X (m)\nis exactly D (m) . If Y is the quotient of X by D, then Y (m) is the quotient\nof X (m) . The quotient sequence of X terminates with an SRC variety if and\nonly if the quotient sequence of X (m) does. Under the assumption that the\nquotient sequence of X has \"splitting case\" in each step, we get that the\nquotient sequence of X (m) has \"splitting case\" in each step. Thus we know\nthat X (m) is not FRC, hence X is not FRC. This proves the the claim and\nhence the main theorem. \u0003\nNow we are ready to prove the following application of the main theorem.\nTheorem 5.2. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 B be a proper flat family over a smooth curve\nB, here everything is over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p.\nAssume that the geometric generic fiber of X \u2192 B is normal and freely\nrationally connected. Then there is a morphism s : B \u2192 X such that\nd\n\u03c0 \u25e6 s = Fabs,B\nfor some d \u2265 0, where Fabs,B : B \u2192 B is the absolute Frobenius\nmorphism.\nProof. We may shrink B and assume that B is affine. Let \u03b7 be the\ngeneric point of B.\nClaim: As a variety over k, X is separably uniruled.\nIndeed, let \u03c6\u03b7\u0304 : P1\u03b7\u0304 \u2192 X\u03b7\u0304 be a maximally free rational\ncurve on the geometric\nL\nn\u2212r\n\u2217\n(\u2295O(ai )) with ai \u2265 1 for\ngeneric fiber. Assume that \u03c6\u03b7\u0304 (TX\u03b7\u0304 ) = O\ni = 1, 2, . . . , r. Then there is a smooth curve C/B such\nL that \u03c6\u03b7\u0304 is actually\ndefined over C and \u03c6\u2217C (TXC /C ) splits uniformly as On\u2212r (\u2295O(ai )). Namely,\n\n22\n\n\fwe then have the following diagram\nP1\u03b7\u0304\n\nP1C\n/\n\n\u03c6\u03b7\u0304\n\n\u03c6C\n\n\u000f\n\nX\u03b7\u0304\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nXC\n/\n\nX\n\n\u03c0C\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03b7\u0304\n/\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\n/\n\nC\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n\nBy shrinking C, we may also assume that the image of \u03c6C is in (X /B)sm \u00d7B\nC. Base change to a closed point c \u2208 C(k), we get a free rational curve\n\u03c6 : P1 \u2192 Xb where b \u2208 B(k) is the image of c. View \u03c6 as a rational curve\non X and by construction we have the image of \u03c6 in the smooth locus of\nX \u2192 B. Then we apply the following short exact sequence\n0\n\n/\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (TXb )\n/\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (TX /k )\n\n\u03c6\u2217 \u03c0 \u2217 (TB/k ) = O\n/\n\n/0\n\nSince \u03c6\u2217 (TXb ) is globally generated, \u03c6\u2217 (TX /k ) must be globally generated.\nLet D be the canonical foliation on X . By construction, D is a submodule of TX /B . Then D induces a foliation D\u03b7\u0304 \u2282 TX\u03b7\u0304 . Since a free rational curve on X is unobstructed and moves to nearby fibres, we have\nPos(\u03c6\u2217\u03b7\u0304 TX\u03b7\u0304 ) = \u03c6\u2217\u03b7\u0304 D\u03b7\u0304 for a maximally free rational curve \u03c6\u03b7\u0304 on X\u03b7\u0304 . Since\nD\u03b7\u0304 \u2282 TX\u03b7\u0304 is saturated, we know that D\u03b7\u0304 is the canonical foliation on X\u03b7\u0304 .\nBy the Claim, we can construct the quotient sequence of X\nf =f0\n\nX = Y0\n\n/\n\nf1\n\nY1\n\n/\n\nY2\n\nf2\n\n/\n\nY3\n\nf3\n\n/\n\n***\n\n(17)\n\nLet Di \u0592\u2192 TYi be the corresponding foliations. Note that all the Di are in\nvertical direction and hence fi are all defined over B. If we base change the\nquotient sequence (17) of X to the geometric generic point \u03b7\u0304 of B, we get\nexactly the quotient sequence of X\u03b7\u0304 . Since X\u03b7\u0304 is FRC, our main theorem\nsays that Yi,\u03b7\u0304 will eventually be an SRC normal variety. Take Y = Yi , where\ni is large enough. Then we have the following diagram\nX\n\nf\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n\n/\n\n\u03c0\u0303\n=\n\n/\n\ng\n\n/\nX\nyy\ny\ny\nyy (d)\n\u000f y| y \u03c0\n\nY\n\nB\n\n(d)\n(d) \u03c3\n\nd\nFabs,B\n\n23\n\n/\n\nX\n/\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n\n\fwhere \u03c0\u0303 has normal SRC geometric generic fiber. By [dJSt], we can find a\nsection of \u03c0\u0303, say s\u0303, then we can just take s = \u03c3 (d) \u25e6 g \u25e6 s\u0303. \u0003\nCorollary 5.3. Let X/k be a proper normal FRC variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p. Then X is simply connected.\nNamely, the algebraic fundamental group \u03c01 (X) is trivial.\nProof. We have to show that every connected finite Galois cover \u03c0 :\nY \u2192 X is trivial. Suppose that \u03c0 is nontrivial. Since free rational curves\non X always lift to free rational curves on Y , we know that Y is also FRC.\nWe can always factor \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X through \u03c0 \u2032 : Y \u2192 X \u2032 with \u03c0 \u2032 being cyclic\nGalois cover with Galois group G \u223c\n= Z/l Z, where l \u2208 Z is a prime. To get a\ncontradiction, we only need to prove the following\nClaim: The action of G on Y has a fixed point.\nTo prove the claim, we fix an action of G on B \u2032 = P1 in the following way:\n\u2022 If l 6= p, then the generator 1 \u2208 G acts as t 7\u2192 \u03b6t where \u03b6 is a primitive\nlth root of unit.\n\u2022 If l = p, then the generator 1 \u2208 G acts as t 7\u2192 t + 1.\nThen we have B = B \u2032 /G \u223c\n= P1 . Since G acts on both Y and B \u2032 , we get a\nnatural action of G on Y \u00d7 B \u2032 and let Z = Y \u00d7 B \u2032 /G be the quotient. Let\nf : B \u2032 \u2192 B and g : Y \u00d7 B \u2032 \u2192 Z be the corresponding quotient morphisms.\nThen we have the following commutative diagram\ng\n\nY \u00d7 B\u2032\n\n/\n\nZ\n\np2\n\nh\n\n\u000f\n\nB\u2032\n\nf\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n\nOn the open part of U \u2282 B where G acts freely on f \u22121 (U), the above\ndiagram is a fiber product square. Hence, for a general b \u2208 B, we have Zb =\nh\u22121 (b) \u223c\n= Y which is normal and FRC. By Theorem 5.2, we get s : B \u2192 Z\nd\nsuch that h \u25e6 s = Fabs,B\nis some power of the absolute Frobenius morphism.\n\u2032\nLet C = B \u00d7f,B,h\u25e6s B, and let C\u0303 = P1 be the normalization of C. The the\naction of G on B induces an action on C and hence also an action on C\u0303.\nThe morphism s induces a G-equivariant morphism s\u2032 : V \u2192 Y \u00d7 B \u2032 , where\nV \u2282 C is the inverse image of U. The morphism s\u2032 induces a G-equivariant\nmorphism s\u0303\u2032 : C\u0303 \u2192 Y \u00d7 B \u2032 . Then \u03c3 = p1 \u25e6 s\u0303\u2032 : C\u0303 \u2192 Y is also G-equivariant.\nSince C\u0303 has at least one fixed point x, its image \u03c3(x) is a fixed point of Y .\n\u0003\n24\n\n\fReferences\n[Art] M.
