We study the space X d (G) of pictures of a graph G in complex\nprojective d-space. The main result is that the homology groups (with integer\ncoefficients) of X d (G) are completely determined by the Tutte polynomial of\nG. One application is a criterion in terms of the Tutte polynomial for independence in the d-parallel matroids studied in combinatorial rigidity theory. For\ncertain special graphs called orchards, the picture space is smooth and has the\nstructure of an iterated projective bundle.

Introduction\nThe theory of configuration varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag and Schubert varieties, is marked by an interplay between different fields of mathematics,\nincluding algebraic geometry, topology and combinatorics. In this paper, we study\na class of configuration varieties called picture spaces of graphs, a program initiated in [10]. As we will see, there is a close connection between the combinatorial\nstructure of a graph and the topology and geometry of its picture space.\nLet G be a graph with vertices V and edges E. The d-dimensional picture space\nX d (G) is defined as the projective algebraic set whose points are pictures of G in\ncomplex projective d-space Pd = PdC . A picture P consists of a point P(v) \u2208 Pd\nfor each vertex v of G and a line P(e) for each edge e, subject to the conditions\nP(v) \u2208 P(e) whenever v is an endpoint of e.\nTwo fundamental operations of graph theory are deletion and contraction: given\na graph G and an edge e, we may delete e to form a graph G\u2212e, or identify the endpoints of e to form a graph G/e. Many combinatorial invariants, such as the number\nof spanning forests, the chromatic polynomial, etc., satisfy a deletion-contraction\nrecurrence; the most general and powerful of these invariants is the Tutte polynomial\nTG (x, y). (For those unfamiliar with the properties of the Tutte polynomial, we\ngive a brief sketch in Section 2.1 below; a much more comprehensive treatment may\nbe found in [3].) In the context of the present study, the graph-theoretic operations\nof deletion and contraction correspond to canonical morphisms (3) and (7) between\npicture spaces. This suggests that there is a connection between the geometry or\ntopology of X d (G) and the Tutte polynomial of G.\nThe main result of this paper (Theorem 1 below) characterizes the integral homology groups of X d (G) completely in terms of the Tutte polynomial. Rather than\nattempting to describe the homology directly, we apply topological machinery, such\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The result is a recurrence describing the homology groups of X d (G) in\nterms of those of X d (G\u2212e) and X d (G/e), where e is any edge of G. This recurrence\nmay in turn be phrased in terms of the Tutte polynomial, as follows.\nTheorem 1. Let G be a graph and d \u2265 2 an integer. Then\n(1) the picture space X d (G) is path-connected and simply connected;\n(2) the homology groups Hi (X d (G)) = Hi (X d (G); Z) are free abelian for i even\nand zero for i odd; and\n(3) the \"compressed Poincar\u00e9 series\"\nX\nq i rankZ H2i (X d (G))\nPGd (q) :=\ni\n\nis a specialization of the Tutte polynomial TG (x, y), namely\n\u0012\n\u0013\n[2]q [d]q\nd\nv(G)\u2212c(G)\nc(G)\nPG (q) = ([d]q \u2212 1)\n[d + 1]q\nTG\n, [d]q\n[d]q \u2212 1\n\nwhere v(G) is the number of vertices of G, c(G) is the number of connected\ncomponents, and [d]q = (1 \u2212 q d )/(1 \u2212 q).\n\nIn Section 2, we set forth some elementary facts and notation involving graphs\nand picture spaces. We assume some familiarity with basic graph theory, for\nwhich [11] is an excellent reference (among many others). For a more leisurely\ntreatment of the picture spaces of graphs, the reader is referred to [10].\nSection 3 contains the proof of Theorem 1. We continue by exploring some\nnatural extensions of this main result. In Section 4, we consider the space X M (G)\nof \"pictures\" of a graph G on a complex manifold M . With suitable conditions\non M , we may mimic the methods of Section 3 to describe the integral homology\ngroups of X M (G) in terms of the Tutte polynomial of G and the dimension and\nPoincar\u00e9 series of M .\nFor a graph G without loops or parallel edges, the picture variety V d (G) \u2282 X d (G)\nis the (irreducible) algebraic variety defined as the closure of the pictures P for which\nthe points P(v) are distinct. For more on this subject, seee [10]. The problem of\nfinding a combinatorial interpretation of the Poincar\u00e9 series of V d (G) appears to\nbe quite difficult. We work out a sample Poincar\u00e9 series calculation in Section 5,\nand attempt to give some idea of the obstacles that are likely to arise.\nSection 6 describes an application of the main result to the theory of combinatorial rigidity. This subject (for which an excellent reference is [6]) concerns\nquestions such as the following. Suppose that we are given a physical framework in\nd-dimensional space, built out of \"joints\" and \"bars\" corresponding to the vertices\nand edges of some graph G. For our purposes, we suppose that the bars may vary in\nlength, but meet the joints at fixed angles. How can one tell from the combinatorial\nstructure of G whether the framework will hold its shape-whether it is \"rigid\" or\n\"flexible\"? We show in Section 6 that this information may be read off from the\nTutte polynomial specialization of Theorem 1. In the language of rigidity theory,\nthis says that all of the information about the d-parallel matroid of a graph G is\ncontained in the Tutte polynomial TG (x, y).\nIn Section 7, we study the multiplicative structure of the cohomology ring\nH \u2217 (X d (G); Z) in the case that X d (G) is smooth. This turns out to be equivalent to the property that G is an \"orchard\": that is, every edge is either a loop or\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n3\n\nan isthmus. For such a graph, X d (G) is an iterated projectivized vector bundle,\nso its cohomology ring has a presentation in terms of Chern classes of line bundles\n(see [2]); we give this presentation as Theorem 17. This in turn leads to a \"Schubert\ncalculus of orchards\": that is, we can answer certain questions involving the enumerative geometry of points and lines in PdC by means of polynomial calculations\nin H \u2217 (X d (G); Z).\nThe author thanks Wojciech Chach\u00f3lski, Sandra Di Rocco, and Victor Reiner for\nhelpful discussions, and an anonymous referee for providing numerous constructive\nsuggestions for improving this paper.\n\n2. Graphs and their Picture Spaces\n2.1. Graphs. We assume some familiarity with the basics of graph theory on the\npart of the reader; a good general reference is [11].\nA graph is a pair G = (V, E), where V = V (G) is a finite nonempty set of\nvertices and E = E(G) is a set of edges. Each edge e has two vertices v, w, not\nnecessarily distinct, called its endpoints. If v = w then e is called a loop. When no\nambiguity can arise, we sometimes denote an edge by its endpoints, e.g., \"e = vw\".\nA subgraph G\u2032 of G is a graph with V (G\u2032 ) \u2282 V (G) and E(G\u2032 ) \u2282 E(G).\nThe set of edges with v as an endpoint is denoted E(v). The set E(v) \u2229 E(w)\nis called a parallel class. A graph is simple if all its of nonloop parallel classes are\nsingletons. (In [10], there is the additional condition that simple graphs contain no\nloops. However, allowing loops does no harm to the results of [10] used here.) An\nunderlying simple graph of a graph G is a graph G\u2032 = (V, E \u2032 ), where E \u2032 consists of\none member of each nonloop parallel class of G.\nA graph G is connected if for every v, w \u2208 V (G), there is a sequence of vertices\nv = v0 , v1 , . . . , vr = w with {vi , vi+1 } \u2208 E(G) for 0 \u2264 i < r. The maximal connected subgraphs of G are called its connected components. We write v(G), e(G),\nand c(G) for, respectively, the number of vertices, edges and connected components\nof G.\nDefinition 2. Let e \u2208 E(G). The deletion G \u2212 e is the graph (V, E \\ {e}). If e is\nnot a loop, the contraction G/e is obtained from G \u2212 e by identifying the endpoints\nof e with each other.\nFor an example of contraction, see Example 13. In general,\ne(G \u2212 e) = e(G) \u2212 1,\n\ne(G/e) = e(G) \u2212 1,\n\nv(G \u2212 e) = v(G),\n\nv(G/e) = v(G) \u2212 1,\n\nc(G \u2212 e) = c(G) or c(G) + 1,\n\nc(G/e) = c(G).\n\nAn edge e is called an isthmus if c(G \u2212 e) = c(G) + 1.\nSome examples of graphs are as follows:\n\u2022 the\n{ij\n\u2022 the\n\u2022 the\n\u2022 the\n\ncomplete graph Kn , a simple graph with vertices {1, . . . , n}, and edges\n| 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n}.\nempty graph Nn , with n vertices and no edges;\nloop graph L1 , consisting of one vertex and a loop, and\ndigon D2 , with two vertices and two parallel nonloop edges.\n\n\f4\n\nJEREMY L.

We describe here only a few of the many properties of the Tutte\npolynomial; see the excellent survey by Brylawski and Oxley [3] for more information. For our present purposes, the following recursive definition of the Tutte\npolynomial will be the most useful.\nDefinition 3. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. The Tutte polynomial TG (x, y) is\ndefined as follows. If e(G) = 0, then TG (x, y) = 1. Otherwise, TG (x, y) is defined\nrecursively as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif e is an isthmus,\n\uf8f2x * TG/e (x, y)\nTG (x, y) = y * TG\u2212e (x, y)\n(1)\nif e is a loop,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nTG\u2212e (x, y) + TG/e (x, y) otherwise.\nfor any e \u2208 E(G). (It is a standard fact, albeit not immediate from the definition,\nthat the choice of e does not matter.)\n\nMany important graph isomorphism invariants satisfy deletion-contraction recurrences of this form, and consequently may be obtained as specializations of the\nTutte polynomial. For instance, TG (1, 1) equals the number of spanning forests\nof G, while TG (2, 2) = 2e(G) . In addition, one can obtain more refined combinatorial data, such as the chromatic and flow polynomials of G, by specializing the\narguments x and y appropriately. Again, the reader is referred to [3] for the full\nstory.\nThere is an equivalent definition of the Tutte polynomial as a certain generating\nfunction for the edge subsets F \u2282 E. Define the rank of F , denoted r(F ), as the\ncardinality of a maximal acyclic subset of F ; equivalently, r(F ) = v(G|F ) \u2212 c(G|F ),\nwhere G|F is the edge-induced subgraph of G. Then the Tutte polynomial may be\ndefined in closed form as the generating function\nX\nTG (x, y) =\n(x \u2212 1)r(E)\u2212r(F ) (y \u2212 1)|F |\u2212r(F )\n(2)\nF \u2282E\n\n[3, eq. 6.13]; this formula will be useful when we study the d-parallel matroid in\nSection 6.\n\n2.2. Picture Spaces. The main objects of our study are picture spaces, projective\nalgebraic sets which parameterize \"pictures\" of a graph in projective d-space Pd over\na field k. In this paper, we shall be concerned exclusively with the case k = C;\nhowever, the picture space may be defined over an arbitrary field. The reader is\nreferred to [10], especially Section 3, for a more thorough discussion of the basic\ntheory of picture spaces.\nDefinition 4. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and d \u2265 2 a positive integer. A picture\nof G in Pd is a tuple P, consisting of a point P(v) \u2208 Pd for each v \u2208 V and a line\nP(e) in Pd for each e \u2208 E, such that P(v) \u2208 P(e) whenever e \u2208 E(v). The set of\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n5\n\nall d-dimensional pictures is called the d-dimensional picture space of G, denoted\nX d (G).\nExample 5. A picture of N1 is a point, so X d (Nn ) \u223c\n= Pd . More generally, a\npicture of the empty graph Nn consists of an ordered n-tuple of points in Pd , so\nX d (Nn ) \u223c\n= (Pd )n .\nThe data for a picture of the complete graph K2 consists of two points P(1), P(2)\nand a line P(12) containing both points. If P(1) 6= P(2), then P(e) is determined\nuniquely, but if P(1) = P(2), then the set of lines containing that point is isomorphic to Pd\u22121 . In fact, X d (K2 ) is the blowup of Pd \u00d7 Pd along the diagonal\n{(p, p) | p \u2208 Pd } (see also [10, Example 3.6]). This is a smooth, irreducible variety.\nAn easy consequence of the definition is that if G1 , . . . , Gr are the connected\ncomponents of G, then X d (G) \u223c\n= X d (G1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 X d (Gr ). In particular, if e(G) = 0,\nd\nd\nv(G)\nthen X (G) \u223c\n.\n= (P )\nAnother elementary consequence is that if e is a loop, then X d (G) is a Pd\u22121 bundle over X d (G \u2212 e). Indeed, a picture of G may be regarded as a picture of\nG \u2212 e, together with a line P(e) containing the point P(v) (where v is the single\nendpoint of e). The fiber Pd\u22121 corresponds to the space of lines through P(v) in\nPd .\nThis last observation may be generalized as follows. Let G = (V, E) be a graph\nand G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ) a subgraph of G. There is a natural epimorphism\nX d (G) \u0589 X d (G\u2032 )\n\n(3)\n\u2032\n\ngiven by forgetting the picture data for vertices and edges not in G . Moreover, if\nG\u2032\u2032 = (V \u2032\u2032 , E \u2032\u2032 ) is another subgraph of G, then the commutative diagram\nX d (G\u2032 \u222a G\u2032\u2032 )\nNNN\nq\nNNN\nqqq\nq\nq\nNNN\nq\nq\nN&\nxqq\nX d (G\u2032 )\nX d (G\u2032\u2032 )\nMMM\nq\nqq\nMMM\nqqq\nMMM\nq\nq\nM&\nxqqq\n\n(4)\n\nX d (G\u2032 \u2229 G\u2032\u2032 )\n\nis easily seen to be a fiber product square. Here G\u2032 \u222a G\u2032\u2032 is the graph with vertices\nV (G\u2032 ) \u222a V (G\u2032\u2032 ) and edges E(G\u2032 ) \u222a E(G\u2032\u2032 ), and G\u2032 \u2229 G\u2032\u2032 is defined similarly.\nConsider the Boolean algebra on E, where each subset E \u2032 \u2282 E is associated\nwith the space X d (V, E \u2032 ). By (3), there is an epimorphism X d (V, E \u2032 ) \u2192 X d (V, E \u2032\u2032 )\nwhenever E \u2032\u2032 \u2282 E \u2032 . Moreover, (4) may be interpreted as saying that the join of two\nspaces is the fiber product over their meet. Accordingly, X d (G) is a fiber product\nof picture spaces of simple graphs-indeed, of graphs with one edge each, which\ncorrespond to the atoms of the Boolean algebra.\nExample 6. Consider the digon D2 , with vertices 1, 2 and parallel edges e1 , e2 . A\npicture of D2 consists of two points P(1), P(2) and two lines P(e1 ), P(e2 ), such that\nP(i) \u2208 P(ej ) for i, j \u2208 {1, 2}. By the previous remarks, we may describe X d (D2 )\nas a fiber product:\nX d (D2 ) = X d (K2 )\n\n\u00d7\n\nX d (N2 )\n\nX d (K2 ).\n\n\f6\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\nThis space is neither smooth nor irreducible. Its irreducible components are\n\b\nX1 = P \u2208 X d (D2 ) | P(e1 ) = P(e2 ) ,\nwhich is isomorphic to X d (K2 ), and\n\b\nX2 = P \u2208 X d (D2 ) | P(1) = P(2) ,\n\nwhich is a bundle over Pd with fiber Pd\u22121 \u00d7 Pd\u22121 . The singular locus of X d (D2 ) is\nX1 \u2229 X2 , which is isomorphic to a Pd\u22121 -bundle over Pd .\nIt will be useful to classify the pictures P of a graph G = (V, E) according to\nwhich points P(v) coincide. Thus we are led to the notion of a cellule.\nDefinition 7. Let \u223cA be an equivalence relation on V (G) with equivalence classes\nA = {A1 , . . . , As }. The corresponding cellule in X d (G) is defined as\n\b\nXAd (G) = P \u2208 X d (G) | P(v) = P(w) \u21d0\u21d2 v \u223cA w .\nA picture P is called generic if P(v) 6= P(w) whenever v 6= w. Equivalently, P\nbelongs to the discrete cellule XDd (G), where D is the equivalence relation whose\nequivalence classes are all singletons.\n\nNote that the cellules are pairwise disjoint, and their union is X d (G). Furthermore, if e is an edge whose endpoints lie in different blocks of A, then the points\nP(v) determine the line P(e) uniquely for each P \u2208 XAd (G). In this case we say\nthat e is constrained with respect to A. Otherwise, varying P(e) while keeping the\nother data of P fixed gives a family of pictures in XAd (G); this family is isomorphic\nto Pd\u22121 . Therefore XAd (G) has the structure of a fiber bundle, whose base is (Pd )|A|\nwith diagonals deleted (that is, the discrete cellule of the empty graph with vertices\nV (G)), and whose fiber is (Pd\u22121 )u(A) , where u(A) is the number of unconstrained\nedges. In particular\ndim XAd (G) = d|A| + (d \u2212 1) * u(A)\n\n(5)\n\nIn addition to (3), there is a second canonical morphism between picture spaces,\nassociated with any nonloop edge e = vw. First, we define the coincidence locus\nZvw (G) = Ze (G) as\n[\n\b\nZvw (G) := P \u2208 X d (G) | P(v) = P(w) =\nXAd (G).\n(6)\nA : v\u223cA w\n\nThen there is a natural monomorphism\n\nX d (G/e) \u0592\u2192 X d (G \u2212 e)\n\n(7)\n\nwhose image is the coincidence locus Zvw (G \u2212 e).\nRemark 8. In light of (3) and (7), one may regard X d as a contravariant functor\nfrom the category of graphs to that of projective algebraic sets. Here a morphism\n\u03c6 : G \u2192 G\u2032 of graphs is a pair of maps V (G) \u2192 V (G\u2032 ) and E(G) \u2192 E(G\u2032 ) such\nthat if v is an endpoint of e, then \u03c6(v) is an endpoint of \u03c6(e). Thus X d sends \u03c6 to\na morphism \u03c6# : X d (G\u2032 ) \u2192 X d (G) defined by\n(\u03c6# P)(a) = P(\u03c6(a)),\nwhere P \u2208 X d (G\u2032 ) and a is a vertex or an edge of G. Furthermore, if G is a\nsubgraph of G\u2032 , then \u03c6# is an epimorphism, while if G\u2032 is a quotient of G (that is,\nit is obtained by a sequence of contractions), then \u03c6# is a monomorphism.\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n7\n\n3. Proof of the Main Theorem\nFor the rest of the paper, we work over the ground field k = C. In this section,\nwe show that the homology groups (with integer coefficients) of X d (G) are completely determined by the Tutte polynomial TG (x, y). We have observed how the\noperations of deletion and contraction correspond to the morphisms (3) and (7)\nof picture spaces. In fact, these morphisms may be extended to a homotopy\npushout square (10), which induces a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence of homology groups. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence permits us to write down a recursive\nformula for the Poincar\u00e9 series of X d (G); this formula may in turn be expressed\nas a specialization of the Tutte polynomial. For the tools of topology that we use\nhere, an excellent reference is [7].\nWe will work with the q-analogues [q]d of integers d, defined as\n[q]d := (1 \u2212 q d )/(1 \u2212 q) = 1 + q + * * * + q d\u22121 .\nWe shall see that for every graph G, the picture space X d (G) has only free abelian\neven-dimensional homology. That is, the groups Hi (X d (G)) = Hi (X d (G); Z) are\nfree abelian for all i, and zero when i is odd. Accordingly, the structure of the\nhomology may be encoded conveniently by the compressed Poincar\u00e9 series whose\ncoefficients are the even Betti numbers:\nX\nq i rankZ H2i (X d (G)).\nPGd (q) :=\ni\n\nWe first consider two simple cases. If e(G) = 0, then X d (G) \u223c\n= (Pd )v(G) , while\nd\nd\u22121 e(G)\nd\nif v(G) = 1, then X (G) is a (P )\n-bundle over P . In both cases, X d (G)\nis a simply connected complex manifold with only free abelian even-dimensional\nhomology. Since the compressed Poincar\u00e9 series of PdC is [d + 1]q , we have\n(\nv(G)\n[d + 1]q\nif e(G) = 0,\n(8)\nPGd (q) =\ne(G)\n[d]q\n[d + 1]q\nif v(G) = 1.\n\nIn the case v(G) = 1, we are using the fact that the Poincar\u00e9 series of X d (G) is the\nsame as that of Pd \u00d7 (Pd\u22121 )e(G) (see, e.g., Proposition 2.3 of [5]).\nNow let G be an arbitrary graph and e \u2208 E(G) a nonloop edge. As in (3) and (7),\nwe have maps\n(9)\nX d (G)\n\u03c0\n\nX d (G/e)\n\n\u001f\u007f\n\n\u03b9\n\n\u000f\u000f\nd\nX (G \u2212 e)\n/\n\nSince \u03b9(X d (G/e)) \u2282 Ze (G \u2212 e) and \u03c0 \u22121 (X d (G/e)) = Ze (G), we may \"complete the\nsquare\" to a commutative diagram\n\u001f\u007f\n/ X d (G)\n(10)\nZe (G)\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\u000f\nd\nX (G/e)\n\n\u001f\u007f\n\n\u03b9\n\n/\n\n\u000f\u000f\nd\nX (G \u2212 e)\n\nLemma 9. The map \u03c0 : Ze (G) \u2192 X d (G/e) is a Pd\u22121 -fibration, and the diagram (10) is a homotopy pushout square.\n\n\f8\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\nProof. Let x, y be the endpoints of e. A picture in Ze (G) may be described by a\npicture of G/e, together with a line in Pd through the point P(x) = P(y). Hence\n\u03c0 \u22121 (P) \u223c\n= Pd\u22121 . In particular, \u03c0 induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of Ze (G) and X d (G/e) (since complex projective d-space is simply\nconnected). Since the map \u03b9 is a monomorphism, the diagram is a homotopy\npushout.\n\u0003\nIt follows from Lemma 9 that (10) induces a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence\n...\n\n\u2192\n\nHi (Ze (G))\n\n\u2192 Hi\u22121 (Ze (G))\n\n\u2192 Hi (X d (G/e)) \u2295 Hi (X d (G))\n\n\u2192 Hi (X d (G \u2212 e))\n\n\u2192 ....\n\n(11)\nThis exact sequence allows us to compute the homology groups recursively, in the\nsame manner as the definition (1) of the Tutte polynomial. We can now prove the\nmain theorem, which we restate for convenience.\nTheorem 1. Let G be a graph and d \u2265 2 an integer. Then\n(1) the picture space X d (G) is path-connected and simply connected;\n(2) the homology groups Hi (X d (G)) are free abelian for i even and zero for i\nodd; and\n(3) the compressed Poincar\u00e9 series PGd (q) may be obtained from the Tutte polynomial TG (x, y) by the formula\n\u0013\n\u0012\n[2]q [d]q\n(12)\n,\n[d]\nPGd (q) = ([d]q \u2212 1)v(G)\u2212c(G) [d + 1]c(G)\nT\nq .\nG\nq\n[d]q \u2212 1\nProof. We first show that X d (G) is path-connected. Let I be the equivalence\nrelation on V in which all vertices are equivalent. The corresponding indiscrete\ncellule XId (G) consists of the pictures P with P(v) = P(w) for all v, w \u2208 V . Thus\nXId (G) is a (Pd\u22121 )e(G) -bundle over Pd ; in particular it is path-connected. On the\nother hand, an arbitrary picture P can be deformed continuously into a picture in\nthe indiscrete cellule XId (G) as follows. Choose a system of local affine coordinates\nfor Pd such that no P(v) lies on the hyperplane at infinity, rescale the coordinates\nof all P(v) uniformly by a constant \u03bb, and let \u03bb tend to zero. Since XId (G) is\npath-connected, so is X d (G).\nWhen v(G) = 1 or e(G) = 0, the formula for PGd (q) follows from (8). For the\ngeneral case, we induct on v(G) and e(G). In particular, we may assume that\nthe theorem holds for X d (G \u2212 e) and X d (G/e). Since Ze (G) is a Pd\u22121 -bundle over\nX d (G/e), it follows from Proposition 2.3 of [5] that Ze (G) has only free abelian evend\ndimensional homology, and its compressed Poincar\u00e9 series is [d]q PG/e\n(q). Since (10)\nd\nis a homotopy pushout and the map Ze (G) \u2192 X (G/e) induces an isomorphism\nof fundamental groups, the map \u03c0 also induces an isomorphism. By induction,\nX d (G) is simply connected. Furthermore, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence (11) gives\nHi (X d (G)) = 0 for i odd, and splits into short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Hi (Z) \u2192 Hi (X d (G/e)) \u2295 Hi (X d (G)) \u2192 Hi (X d (G \u2212 e)) \u2192 0\nfor i even. In particular, Hi (X d (G)) is free abelian for all i,\n\n(13)\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n9\n\nRecall the definition (1) of the Tutte polynomial. In order to establish (12), it\nsuffices to show that\nPGd (q) = [d + 1]qv(G)\n\nif e(G) = 0,\n\n(14a)\n\nd\nPGd (q) = [d]q PG\u2212e\n(q)\n\nif e \u2208 E is a loop,\n\n(14b)\n\nif e is an isthmus,\n\n(14c)\n\notherwise.\n\n(14d)\n\nPGd (q)\nPGd (q)\n\n=\n\nd\n(q)\n[2]q [d]q PG/e\n\n=\n\nd\nPG\u2212e\n(q)\n\n+ ([d]q \u2212\n\nd\n(q)\n1)PG/e\n\nIndeed, (14a) is precisely (8), and (14d) follows from (13). If e is a loop, then\nd\nPGd (q) is a Pd\u22121 -bundle over PG/e\n(q), which implies (14b). Now suppose that e is\nan isthmus with endpoints v1 , v2 . It suffices to consider the case that G is connected\nand that G \u2212 e has two connected components G1 , G2 , with vi \u2208 V (Gi ). Then\nX d (G \u2212 e) \u223c\n= X d (G1 ) \u00d7 X d (G2 )\nand\nX d (G/e) \u223c\n= X d (G1 ) \u00d7 X d (G2 )\nPd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nwhere the maps X (Gi ) \u2192 P are given by P 7\u2192 P(vi ) for i = 1, 2. It follows that\nd\nd\nPG\u2212e\n(q) = [d + 1]q PG/e\n(q).\n\nSubstituting this into the recurrence defining PGd (q), we obtain\nd\nd\nd\n(q)\n(q) = [2]q [d]q PG/e\n(q) + [d + 1]q PG/e\nPGd (q) = ([d]q \u2212 1) PG/e\n\nyielding (14c) as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Pictures on a Complex Manifold\nWe may generalize the preceding results by replacing PdC with a complex manifold\nM of dimension d, provided that M has only free abelian even-dimensional homology. That is, we study the space X M (G) of \"M -pictures\" of G. In this setting,\nwe are faced immediately with the problem of how to describe \"lines\" in M corresponding to edges of G. To resolve this question, we rely on the observations that\nfor e = vw \u2208 E, the data P(e) is redundant if P(v) 6= P(w), and if P(v) = P(w),\nthen P(e) may be described as a tangent direction at P(v). With this in mind, we\ncan formulate a definition of X M (G) which specializes to X d (G) in the case that\nM = Pd , and whose Poincar\u00e9 series obeys a recurrence akin to (12). We omit the\nproofs, which are analogous to those of Theorem 1.\nDenote by T M the tangent bundle of M , and by Tp M the tangent space of M\nat a point p. Note that T M is a rank-d complex vector bundle over M , and its\nprojectivization P(T M ) (see Section 7.1) is a bundle over M with fiber Pd\u22121 .\nDefinition 10. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and M a simply connected, compact\ncomplex manifold of dimension d which has only free abelian even-dimensional\nhomology. The space of M -pictures of G, denoted X M (G), is defined recursively\nas follows:\n\u2022 If E = \u2205, then X M (G) is the direct product of v(G) copies of M .\n\u2022 If G = L1 , then X M (G) = P(T M ).\n\u2022 If G = K2 , then X M (G) is the blowup of M \u00d7 M along the diagonal. (Note\nthat blowups exist in the category of manifolds.)\n\n\f10\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\n\u2022 Suppose that E is the disjoint union of nonempty sets E1 and E2 , and let\nGi = (V, Ei ) for i = 1, 2. Also, let G0 = (V, \u2205). In this case, we define\nX M (G) as a fiber product:\nX M (G) = X M (G1 )\n\n\u00d7\n\nX M (G0 )\n\nX M (G2 ).\n\nLet e = vw \u2208 E. As before, we define the coincidence locus Ze (X M (G)) to be\nthe set of pictures P \u2208 X M (G) for which P(v) = P(w). Then the analogue of (10)\nis the commutative diagram\n\u001f\u007f\n/ X M (G)\n(15)\nZe (X M (G))\n\u03c0\n\nX\n\nM\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n(G/e)\n\n\u000f\u000f\nM\nZe (X (G \u2212 e))\n\n/\n\n\u001f\u007f\n\nX\n\nM\n\n\u000f\u000f\n(G \u2212 e)\n\nwhich is a homotopy pushout square, with the map \u03c0 a Pd\u22121 -fibration. As in\nthe proof of Theorem 1, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence associated with (15) implies\n(by induction) that X M (G) has has only free abelian even-dimensional homology,\nand leads to a recurrence for its Poincar\u00e9 series. This recurrence may in turn be\ntranslated into a formula in terms of the Tutte polynomial of G:\nX\nq i rankZ H2i (X M (G)) =\ni\n\nv(G)\u2212c(G)\n\n([d]q \u2212 1)\n\nc(G)\n\nP (M )\n\nTG\n\n\u0012\n\nP (M ) + [d]q \u2212 1\n, [d]q\n[d]q \u2212 1\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\nwhere P (M ) = Poin(M ; q 1/2 ). One can easily check that this formula specializes\nto that of Theorem 1 in the case M = Pd , P (M ) = [d + 1]q .\n5. The Picture Variety\nIt is natural to ask if one can inductively calculate the Poincar\u00e9 series of the\npicture variety V d (G), as we did above for the picture space X d (G). However, it\nseems that the only part of Theorem 1 that can be extended to V d (G) in general\nis the simple argument for path-connectivity. The problem is that the coincidence\nlocus of an edge in a picture variety is difficult to describe in general; it is not\nalways isomorphic to V d (G/e). The analogue of (10) for picture varieties is the\nblowup diagram\n/ V d (G)\n(17)\nE\np\n\n\u000f\nZe (G \u2212 e)\n\n\u000f\n/ V d (G \u2212 e)\n\nwhere Ze (G \u2212 e) now denotes the coincidence locus of e in V d (G \u2212 e) and E is\nthe exceptional divisor of the blowup (see Remark 3.5 of [10]). While (17) is a\nhomotopy pushout square, the coincidence locus Ze (G \u2212 e) may not be irreducible\nor even equidimensional. So the map p in (17) may not be a Pd\u22121 -fibration, and\nthere appears to be no general way to calculate the Poincar\u00e9 series of V d (G) using\na Mayer-Vietoris argument.\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n11\n\nExample 11. To give a sense of the difficulties involved, we sketch the calculation\nof the Poincar\u00e9 series of V d (G) in the case G = K4 , d = 2. In a sense, this is the\nsimplest case not covered by Theorem 1, since K4 is the only simple graph with 4\nor fewer vertices for which V 2 (G) 6= X 2 (G).\nLet e be the edge joining vertices 1 and 2: then V 2 (G) is the blowup of V 2 (G \u2212\ne) along the coincidence locus of e. This is the disjoint union of five cellules,\ncorresponding to the five equivalence relations A on V (G) = {1, 2, 3, 4} with 1, 2\nequivalent. Using the cellule dimension formula (5), one finds that one of these\nfive cellules (the indiscrete cellule) has codimension 1, three have codimension 2,\nand one has codimension 3. Every component of Z must have codimension at\nmost 2 (since Z is defined locally by two equations; see [10]), so we can ignore the\ncodimension-3 cellule. On the other hand, blowing up a codimension-1 subvariety\nis a trivial operation, so we can also ignore the indiscrete cellule. Let Z \u2032 be the\nunion of the three remaining cellules; then V 2 (G) is the blowup of V 2 (G \u2212 e) along\nZ \u2032 , and the exceptional divisor E \u2032 of the blowup is a P1 -bundle over Z \u2032 . Moreover,\nreplacing Z, E with Z \u2032 , E \u2032 in (17), we obtain a homotopy pushout square, and a\nMayer-Vietoris sequence akin to (11).\nWe can now verify that Z \u2032 is connected, simply connected, and has only free\nabelian even-dimensional homology. Moreover, the Poincar\u00e9 series of Z \u2032 may be\ncalculated by applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to its decomposition into three\nirreducible components. By Proposition 2.3 of [5], E \u2032 shares the first three properties, and its compressed Poincar\u00e9 series is (1 + q) times that of Z \u2032 . Finally,\nV 2 (G \u2212 e) = X 2 (G \u2212 e) because G \u2212 e is rigidity-independent (see [10, Theorem\n4.5]), so the Poincar\u00e9 series of that space is given by Theorem 1. By an argument\nsimilar to the proof of Theorem 1, V 2 (G) has only free abelian even-dimensional\nhomology, and its compressed Poincar\u00e9 series is\n(1 + q)(1 + q + q 2 )(q 5 + 13q 4 + 32q 3 + 24q 2 + 8q + 1).\nIt is not clear what combinatorial significance this polynomial has, if any.\nThe technique of ignoring the codimension-1 components from the coincidence\nlocus does allow us to prove a general fact about picture varieties in the projective\nplane.\nProposition 12. Let G be a simple graph. Then V 2 (G) is simply connected.\nProof. Let e \u2208 E(G). We have seen that in the blowup diagram (17), every component of the coincidence locus Ze (G \u2212 e) has codimension 1 or 2. As in the preceding\nexample, the codimension-1 components may safely be ignored, and the map p\nis a fibration with simply connected fiber P1 , hence induces an isomorphism of\nfundamental groups. Since (17) is a homotopy pushout, we also have an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of V 2 (G) and V 2 (G \u2212 e), so we are done by\ninduction on the number of edges.\n\u0003\nIf d > 2, then this argument does not go through because Z \u2032 may not be equidimensional (the codimensions of its components may vary between 2 and d), in which\ncase p is not a fibration.\nA fundamental difficulty in extending our results to picture varieties is that it\nis unclear how to define V d (G) in the case that G is not simple. If we \"naively\"\ntake V d (G) to be the closure of the locus of generic pictures in X d (G), then the\nstructure of parallel edges is lost. Indeed, if e, e\u2032 are parallel, then P(e) = P(e\u2032 )\n\n\f12\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\nfor all generic pictures, hence for all pictures in V d (G), which implies that V d (G)\nis isomorphic to the picture variety of its underlying simple graph.\nA less trivial approach is to define V d (G) as the locus of all pictures P \u2208 X d (G)\nsuch that each \"underlying simple picture\" of P belongs to the picture variety\nof the corresponding underlying simple graph. This may be described as a fiber\nproduct, in the spirit of (4). Specifically, we define V d (G) as the fiber product of\nthe picture varieties V d (Gi ), where G1 , G2 , . . . are the underlying simple graphs\nof G. This definition preserves the structure of parallel edges; however, there still\nexist coincidence loci which are hard to describe.\nExample 13. Consider the graphs G and G/e given by the following figure.\nv\nx\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2745\u2745g\n\u2745\n\u2745\u2709 z\n\u2745 f\n\u2745\ne\n\u2745\u2709\n\u2709\ny\nw\n\nv\nx\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2745\ng\n\u2745 f\n\u2745\n\u2745\u2709\n\u2709\nyz\nw\n\nG/e\nG\nNote that the nonparallel edges f, g become parallel in G/e. Let G1 (resp. G2 )\nbe the underlying simple graph of G/e containing f (resp. g), and let A be the\npartition of V (G) in which {y, z} is the only nonsingleton block. Since each Gi is\nisomorphic to K4 , Theorem 5.5 of [10]) and our fiber product construction imply\nthat the picture variety V d (G/e) is the vanishing locus in X d (G/e) of two polynomials \u03c4 (G1 ), \u03c4 (G2 ) (called in [10] the tree polynomials of G1 and G2 respectively).\nd\nThen \u03c4 (G1 ) vanishes on VA\n(G \u2212 e) but \u03c4 (G2 ) does not, because E(G) \\ {e, g} is a\nd\nrigidity circuit (see [10]) while E(G)\\ {e, f } is independent. Accordingly, VA\n(G\u2212 e)\nd\nd\nis isomorphic neither to X (G/e) nor V (G/e).\nWe suspect that V d (G) has in general only free abelian even-dimensional homology; it may be possible to describe the centers of the iterated blowings-up\nsufficiently well to apply a result such as Proposition 2.3 of [5].\n6. Applications to Parallel Independence\nLet P be a d-dimensional picture of a graph G = (V, E). Consider a physical\nmodel of P consisting of a \"bar\" for each edge e and a \"joint\" for each vertex v. If e\nhas v as an endpoint, then the corresponding bar is attached to the corresponding\njoint. The bars may cross, and their lengths are allowed to vary, but we fix the\nangles at which the bars are attached to the joints. Thus, for example, a square\nframework may be deformed to produce an arbitrary rectangle, but not any other\nrhombus. Under what conditions on G is such a model rigid? That is, when is\nthe model determined up to scaling by specifying the attaching angles? These and\nsimilar questions are the focus of combinatorial rigidity theory; for more details,\nsee, e.g., [6] and [12].\nThe graph G (or, more properly, its edge set) is said to be d-parallel independent\nif for a generic picture in X d (G), the directions of the lines representing edges are\nmutually unconstrained. For instance, K3 is 2-parallel independent, because the\nslopes of two lines of a triangle in the plane do not determine that of the third.\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n13\n\nHowever, K3 is d-parallel dependent for d \u2265 3, because the three sides of a triangle\nmust be coplanar. (The smallest simple graph which is 2-parallel dependent is K4 .)\nThe condition of d-parallel independence is in fact a matroid independence condition; for the reader not familiar with matroids, we remark here only that it satisfies\ncertain axioms which abstract the idea of linear independence in a vector space. Returning to rigidity for a moment, a generic d-dimensional model of G, as described\nabove, will hold its shape if and only if E(G) contains a d-parallel independent set\nof cardinality d * v(G) \u2212 (d + 1) [12, Theorem 8.2.2].\nThe Poincar\u00e9 series formula of Theorem 1 may be applied to give a criterion\nfor d-parallel independence in terms of the Tutte polynomial. The central idea is\nthat parallel independence can be determined from the dimension and number of\nmaximal-dimensional components of X d (G), which can in turn be read off from\nits Poincar\u00e9 series. Specifically, let X be a connected algebraic subset of PnC of\n(complex) dimension d, and let c be the number of irreducible components of X of\ndimension d. By [4, Appendix A, Lemmas 2 and 4], the leading term of the Poincar\u00e9\nseries Poin(X; q) is cq 2d . We apply this fact in the case that X = X d (G). (Note that\nthe picture space is defined as an algebraic subset of a product of Grassmannians,\nwhich may be identified in some complex projective space by means of the Pl\u00fccker\nand Segre embeddings (see, e.g., [4, \u00a79.1].)\nTheorem 14. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and d \u2265 2 an integer. Then E is\nindependent in the generic d-parallel matroid if and only if the polynomial\n\u0013\n\u0012\n[2]q [d]q\n, [d]q\n([d]q \u2212 1)v(G)\u2212c(G) TG\n[d]q \u2212 1\nis monic of degree d(v(G) \u2212 c(G)).\nProof. It suffices to consider the case that G is simple, since L1 and D2 are circuits\nin the d-parallel matroid for every d (this follows from Theorem 8.2.2 of [12]). In\nthis case, Theorem 4.5 of [10] tells us that E is independent with respect to the 2dimensional generic rigidity matroid if and only if V 2 (G) = X 2 (G). The argument\nof [10] can be generalized as follows: for all d, E is d-parallel independent if and\nonly if V d (G) = X d (G). Recall that V d (G) is an irreducible component of X d (G) of\ndimension d * v(G) and all other components have equal or greater dimension. By\nthe preceding remarks, G is d-parallel independent if and only if the compressed\nPoincar\u00e9 series of X d (G), as given by Theorem 1, is monic of degree d*v(G). By (2),\nwe have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf (q)\nf (q)\n[2]q [d]q\n, [d]q =\n=\nTG\n[d]q \u2212 1\n([d]q \u2212 1)r(E)\n([d]q \u2212 1)v(G)\u2212c(G)\nwhere f (q) is a polynomial in q, and r is the rank function on subsets of E. Therec(G)\nfore, dividing the compressed Poincar\u00e9 series by [d + 1]q , which itself is monic of\ndegree d * c(G), produces a polynomial, which is monic of degree d(v(G) \u2212 c(G)) if\nand only if G is d-parallel independent.\n\u0003\nOne should note that this does not lead to an efficient algorithm for computing\nthe d-parallel behavior of an edge set. The Tutte polynomial is exponentially hard to\ncompute (see [8]), and determining whether an edge set F is d-parallel independent\nappears to be polynomial-time in |F | (see, e.g., [6, \u00a74.10].\n\n\f14\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\n7. Orchards\nA graph G = (V, E) is an orchard if every edge of G is either a loop or an\nisthmus.1 The orchards are precisely the graphs whose picture spaces are smooth;\nindeed, the picture space of an orchard G is an iterated bundle in which each\nfiber is a complex projective space. Thus we may write down an explicit \"Borel\"\npresentation for the integral cohomology ring H \u2217 (X d (G)) = H \u2217 (X d (G); Z) in terms\nof the Chern classes of natural line bundles on X d (G). The Borel presentation allows\nus to formulate a \"Schubert calculus of orchards\", that is, a method of answering\nenumerative geometry questions about X d (G) in terms of Schubert polynomial\ncalculations.\n7.1. The Cohomology Ring. Denote the number of isthmuses and loops of a\ngraph G by i(G) and l(G) respectively. If G is an orchard, then by (2) its Tutte\npolynomial is TG (x, y) = xi(G) y l(G) , so by Theorem 1 the compressed Poincar\u00e9\nseries of X d (G) is\n.\n(18)\nPGd (q) = [d + 1]c(G)\n[2]qi(G) [d]e(G)\nq\nq\nThis polynomial is palindromic, suggesting that the picture space of an orchard is\nsmooth (by Poincar\u00e9 duality). In fact, more is true.\nProposition 15. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and d \u2265 2. The picture space X d (G)\nis smooth if and only if G is an orchard.\nProof. Suppose that G is an orchard. If e(G) = 0, then X d (G) = (Pd )v(G) is\nsmooth. Otherwise, let e \u2208 E. We shall shortly prove in Theorem 17 that X d (G)\nis the projectivization of a complex vector bundle with base X d (G \u2212 e) (if e is a\nloop) or X d (G/e) (if e is an isthmus). It follows by induction on e(G) that X d (G)\nis smooth.\nNow suppose that G is not an orchard. It suffices to consider the case that G is\nconnected and has no loops (since X d (G) is the Cartesian product of the picture\nspaces of the connected components of G, and loops correspond to Pd\u22121 -bundles).\nIn this case e(G) \u2265 v(G). Let P be a generic picture, so that X d (G) looks locally\nlike (Pd )v(G) near P. Therefore\ndim TP (X d (G)) = d * v(G).\n\n(19)\n\nAt the other extreme, let Q be a picture such that Q(v) = Q(w) = p for all v, w \u2208 V\nand Q(e) = Q(f ) = l for all e, f \u2208 E. Then we can deform Q into another picture\nof G in the following ways:\n\u2022 for any v \u2208 V , move the point Q(v) along the line l;\n\u2022 for any e \u2208 E, rotate Q(e) through the space of lines containing p; or\n\u2022 move the line in a direction \"orthogonal\" to itself (producing another totally\ndegenerate picture).\n(Here \"orthogonal\" really means \"orthogonal with respect to local affine coordinates\nin which the hyperplane at infinity does not contain p\".) It follows that\ndim TQ (X d (G)) \u2265 v(G) + (d \u2212 1) * e(G) + (d \u2212 1)\n\u2265 d * v(G) + d \u2212 1\n\n(20)\n\n> d * v(G),\n1To justify this terminology, G is a forest with possibly some added loops, which resemble fruit\nhanging from the trees.\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n15\n\nwhich together with (19) implies that X d (G) is not smooth.\n\n\u0003\n\ns . This is not an orchard, so\nRemark 16. Let G be the \"acetylene\" graph s\nX 2 (G) is not smooth. However, its Poincar\u00e9 series is palindromic: the formula of\nTheorem 1 yields PG2 (q) = 1 + 5q + 9q 2 + 9q 3 + 5q 4 + q 5 .\nIn order to give a presentation of the cohomology ring H \u2217 (X d (G)), we will need\nseveral facts about vector bundles over complex manifolds. We summarize these\nbriefly. (For more details, see chapter IV of [2], especially pp. 269\u2013271.)\nLet M be a complex manifold and E a complex vector bundle of rank d over M .\n\u03c0\nThe projectivization of E is the fiber bundle P(E) \u2192 M whose fiber at a point\nm \u2208 M is P(E)m = P(Em ), that is, the space of lines through the origin in the\nfiber of E at m. Thus \u03c0 \u22121 E is a rank-d vector bundle over P(E). The tautological\nsubbundle L is the line bundle on P(E) defined fiberwise by Lp = p (regarding p as\na line in E\u03c0(p) ). Thus we have a commutative diagram\n/ \u22121\nLC\nCC \u03c0 E\nCC\nCC\nC! \u000f\nP(E)\n\n/E\n\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nand with this setup, one has\nH \u2217 (P(E)) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (M )[x] / xd + c1 (E)xd\u22121 + * * * + cd (E)\n\n(22)\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere ci (E) denotes the ith Chern class of E, and x = c1 (L ). The Chern classes\nsatisfy the following properties (see [2, p. 271]). First, if E is a trivial bundle then\nci (E) = 0 for i > 0. Second, if \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y is a map of spaces and E is a vector\nbundle on Y , then\nci (\u03c0 \u22121 E) = \u03c0 \u2217 (ci (E)).\n(23)\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nThird, there is the Whitney product formula: if 0 \u2192 E \u2192 E \u2192 E \u2192 0 is an\nexact sequence of vector bundles on X, then\nc(E) = c(E \u2032 ) c(E \u2032\u2032 )\n\n(24)\n\nwhere c(E) = 1 + c1 (E) + c2 (E) + . . . is the total Chern class. In particular, if L is\na line bundle with dual bundle L\u2217 , then L \u2297 L\u2217 is a trivial bundle, so\nci (L\u2217 ) = \u2212ci (L).\n\n(25)\n\u2032\n\nGiven an orchard G, we may \"prune\" G to obtain a smaller orchard G such that\nX d (G) is the projectivization of a vector bundle E on X d (G\u2032 ). The tautological line\nbundle of E may be expressed fiberwise in terms of the data P(v) and P(e), allowing\nus to describe the cohomology ring of X d (G) inductively by means of (22).\nDenote by Gr(r, Cn ) the Grassmannian variety of r-dimensional vector subspaces\nof Cn . Thus P(v) and P(e) may be regarded as elements of Gr(1, Cd+1 ) and\nGr(2, Cd+1 ), respectively. All the vector bundles we shall consider on X d (G) are\nsubbundles of the trivial bundle W = Cd+1 \u00d7 X d (G).

It suffices to consider the case that G is connected, because the picture space\nof a graph is the product of the picture spaces of its connected components.\nWe induct on e(G). If E = \u2205, then\nH \u2217 (X d (G))\n\n\u223c\n=\n\u223c\n=\n\nZ[xv : v \u2208 V ] / xd+1\n: v\u2208V\nv\nO\nd+1\nZ[xv ] / xv\nv\u2208V\n\n(the tensor product over Z), because X d (G) \u223c\n= (Pd )v(G) . Furthermore, xv is the\ndual Chern class of the line bundle with fiber P(v) (that is, the pullback to X d (G)\nof the tautological line bundle on the copy of Pd indexed by v).\nNow, suppose that e(G) > 0 and that the theorem holds for all orchards with\nfewer edges than G. First, consider the case that there is at least one loop e,\nincident to a vertex v. Let G\u2032 = G \u2212 e. Consider the vector bundles Lv and W on\nX d (G\u2032 ), of ranks 1 and d + 1 respectively. A picture of G may be specified by giving\na picture P of G\u2032 , together with a plane P(e) \u2208 Gr(2, Cd+1 ) such that P(v) \u2282 P(e).\nEquivalently, X d (G) = P(Q), where Q is the quotient bundle W/Lv . Let Ke,v be\nthe tautological line bundle associated to \u03c0 \u22121 Q, so we have a diagram\n/ \u03c0 \u22121 Q\nKe,v M\nMMM\nMMM\nMMM\nM&\n\u000f\nd\nX (G) = P(Q)\n\n/W\n/Q\nLv F\ny\nFF\ny\ny\nFF\nyy\nFF\nFF\nyy\ny\n# \u000f |y\n\u03c0\n/ X d (G\u2032 )\n\n\u2217\nNote that the map \u03c0 is a Pd\u22121 -fibration. Let ye,v = c1 (Ke,v\n). By (22),\nd\nd\u22121\nH \u2217 (X d (G)) = H \u2217 (X d (G\u2032 ))[ye,v ] / ye,v\n+ c1 (Q)ye,v\n+ * * * + cd (Q) .\n\nBy the Whitney formula, c(Lv )c(Q) = c(W) = 1.

Since G is connected,\ne is not a loop. Let w be the other endpoint of e, and let G\u2032 be the orchard\nobtained from G by deleting v and e and adding a loop \u1ebd incident to w. Forgetting\nthe coordinates of P(v) and setting P(\u1ebd) = P(e) gives an epimorphism X d (G) \u2192\nX d (G\u2032 ). Moreover, a picture of G may be specified by giving a picture P of G\u2032 ,\ntogether with a line P(v) \u2282 P(e).

We note here some special cases for later use,\nomitting the calculations. We write a permutation w \u2208 Sn in one-line notation as\na sequence (w(1), w(2), . . . , w(n)) (sometimes omitting the commas for brevity):\n\u2022 If w is the identity permutation, then Sw = 1 (the fundamental class, since\n\u03a9w is the whole flag variety).\n\u2022 If w = (n, n\u22121, . . . , 2, 1) is the unique permutation of maximal length, then\nSw = \u03be1n\u22121 \u03be2n\u22122 . . . \u03ben\u22121 . This is the cohomology class of a point in F l(n).\n\u2022 If w is the transposition of i with i + 1, then Sw = \u03be1 + * * * + \u03bei .\n\u2022 If w = (n, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1), then Sw = \u03be1d .\nThe Schubert calculus may be extended to the partial flag manifold\n\b\nF l1,2 (d + 1) = F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 Cd+1 | dim Fi = i ,\n\nwhich is isomorphic to the picture space X d (L1 ). The natural surjection F l(d+1) \u2192\nF l1,2 (d + 1), forgetting the data F3 , . . . , Fd , induces a decomposition of F l1,2 (d)\ninto Schubert cells \u03a9\u25e6w of a form analogous to (30), where w \u2208 Sd+1 is a permutation\nsuch that\nw3 > w4 > * * * > wd+1 .\n(32)\nFor such permutations, the Schubert polynomial Sw = [\u03a9w ] involves only the\nvariables \u03be1 and \u03be2 .\nMore generally, if G = (V, E) is an orchard, v \u2208 V , and e \u2208 E(v), then there is\na fibration\n\u03c0 = \u03c0v,e : X d (G) \u2192 X d (L1 ) \u223c\n= F l1,2 (d + 1)\nsending a picture P to the partial flag P(v) \u2282 P(e). Thus X d (G) is a disjoint union\nof \"Schubert cells\" of the form\n\\\n\u03c0 \u22121 (\u03a9\u25e6wv,e )\n\u03a9\u25e6w =\ne\u2208E(v)\n\nindexed by tuples w of permutations wv,e \u2208 Sd+1 . It is easy to prove (by induction\non |E|) that each \u03a9\u25e6w is isomorphic to an affine space, and to obtain conditions\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n19\n\non the permutations wv,e for \u03a9\u25e6w to be nonempty. We expect that in general the\n\"orchard Schubert variety\" \u03a9w = \u03a9\u25e6w should be a union of cells; however, it is not\nclear how to describe the partial order analogous to (31).\nExample 18. Let G = K2 , with vertices v1 , v2 and edge e. For i \u2208 {1, 2}, there\nis a surjection \u03c0i : X 2 (K2 ) \u2192 F l(3), sending a picture P to the complete flag\n0 \u2282 P(vi ) \u2282 P(e) \u2282 C3 . Thus X 2 (K2 ) decomposes into Schubert cells\n\u03a9\u25e6\u03c3 = \u03c01\u22121 (\u03a9\u03c31 ) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (\u03a9\u03c32 )\nwhere \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u2208 S3 \u00d7 S3 . In fact, \u03a9\u25e6\u03c3 is nonempty if and only if \u03c31 (3) = \u03c32 (3).\nOne may verify that the closure of a cell is indeed a union of cells, and that the\nclosure order analogous to (31) is given by the following diagram:\n\u03a9\u25e6\ni 123,123 UUUUU\ni\ni\ni\nUUUU\niiii\nUUUU\niiii\ni\nUUUU\ni\ni\ni\ni\nUU\nii\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u03a9213,123 XXX\n\u03a9132,132 U\nff s\u03a9123,213\nf\nU\ni\nK\nKK XXXXXXX\nf\ni\nf\nU\nf\ni\nU\nK\nf\nKK UfUfUfUfUfff\nKK\ns\nXiXiXiXiXi\nK\nKK\nss\nXXXXX\nKiKiiiiii\nXXfXfXfXffffffKfKK UUUUUUsUss\nXXXXX K\nfff\nss UUU\niiii K \u25e6\nXX \u25e6\nfffff\n\u03a9\u25e6\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\u25e6312,132 U\n\u03a9213,213 XXX\nUUUU s\nKK XXXXXXX ffffffff 231,231KK iiii 132,312\nf\nsU\nK\niK\nss UUUUUU ffKfKfKffffff XXXXXXXXXX iiiiii KKK\ni\nU\nX\nss\nK\nf\nX\ni\nf\nU\nf\nX\ni\nU\ns\nK\nX\ni\nXXXXXX KKK\nUUUU K\nssffffffffff\niiii\nXX \u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u03a9321,231 U\n\u03a9231,321\n\u03a9312,312\nUUUU\nii\ni\ni\ni\nUUUU\niiii\nUUUU\nUUUU\niiii\ni\ni\ni\nUU\niii\n\u03a9\u25e6321,321\nNote that this is strictly weaker than the product of two copies of the strong Bruhat\norder. For instance, 231 > 213 in Bruhat order, but the cells \u03a9\u25e6231,231 and \u03a9\u25e6213,213\nboth have complex dimension 2, hence are incomparable.\nWe can use the cell decomposition of X d (G) to extend the methods of Schubert\ncalculus to orchards, using the presentation of the cohomology ring given in Theorem 17. That is, we can count the number of pictures of an orchard G = (V, E)\nmeeting a given list of hyperplanes in Pd in certain ways. For v \u2208 V and e \u2208 E(v),\nthe map \u03c0 = \u03c0v,e : X d (G) \u2192 F l1,2 (d + 1) induces a graded ring homomorphism\n\u03c0 \u2217 : H \u2217 (F l1,2 (d + 1)) \u2192 H \u2217 (X d (G))\nwith the property that\n\u03c0 \u2217 [Z] = [\u03c0 \u22121 Z]\n1,2\n\n(33)\n\nfor all Z \u2282 F l (d + 1). In particular, suppose that w \u2208 Sd+1 is a permutation\nsatisfying (32). Then we can calculate the cohomology class of Y = \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03a9w ) by\nevaluating the Schubert polynomial Sw = Sw (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) at \u03be1 = xv , \u03be2 = ze \u2212 xv . For\nexample, nine of the twelve varieties \u03a9\u03c31 ,\u03c32 \u2282 X 2 (K2 ) are pullbacks of Schubert\nvarieties in F l(3) under \u03c01 or \u03c02 (the exceptions are \u03a9123,123 , \u03a9132,132 , and \u03a9231,231 ).\nBefore giving an example of how this theory may be applied to solve a problem\nin enumerative geometry, we need one final ingredient-the cohomology class of a\npoint.\n\n\f20\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\nProposition 19. Let G = (V, E) be an orchard. With respect to the presentation (29), the cohomology class of a point in X d (G, E) is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nY\nY\n\uf8edxdv\nhd\u22121 (xv , ye \u2212 xv )\uf8f8 .\nv\u2208V\n\nloops e\u2208E(v)\n\nProof. Suppose first that G is a forest (that is, it has no loops). Let v \u2208 V and\np \u2208 Pd . Define\nZv = {P \u2208 X d (G) | P(v) = p}.\n\nLet \u03c0 : X d (G) \u2192 Pd be the map sending P to P(v). Then\n[Zv ] = [\u03c0 \u22121 (p0 )] = \u03c0 \u2217 [p0 ].\nThe cohomology ring of Pd is Z[\u03be]/ \u03be d , where \u03be = c1 (E \u2217 ) and E is the tautological\nline bundle on Pd . Then \u03c0 \u22121 E = Lv , so by (23) and the previous equation we\nhave [Zv ] = xdv . The discrete cellule is dense in X d (G), because trees are d-parallel\nindependent for all d by [12, Theorem 8.2.2]. This amounts to saying that the\nsubvarieties Zv of Q\nX d (G) intersect transversely in a point. Hence the cohomology\nclass of a point is v\u2208V xdv .\nNow, suppose that G contains one or more loops. Let q \u2208 Pd \\ {p}. For each\nloop e \u2208 E(v), define\nYe = {P \u2208 X d (G) | q \u2208 P(e)}.\nThen Ye = \u03c0v,e \u22121 (\u03a9w ), where w = (d + 1, 1, d, d \u2212 1, . . . , 2) \u2208 Sd+1 . Using the\nspecial cases of Schubert polynomials mentioned previously and the Demazure divided difference operators (we omit the details), one may show that [Ye ] = Sw =\nhd\u22121 (xv , ye \u2212 xv ). Then the collection of subvarieties\n{Zv | v \u2208 V } \u222a {Ye | e \u2208 E is a loop}\nintersects transversely in a point, which implies the desired result.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 20. Let G be the tree with vertices V = {1, 2, 3} and edges E = {12, 13}:\n1\n\u2775\u2775\u2775\n2 \u2725\u2725\u2725\u2725\u2709\n\u2775 3\n\u2725\n\u2709 12\n13 \u2775\u2709\nG\nLet A1 , A2 , A3 \u2282 P3 be planes, and let A4 , . . . , A9 \u2282 P3 be lines, with the collection\n{Ai } in general position. We will calculate the number of pictures of G in P3\nsatisfying the conditions\nP(i) \u2208 Ai\n\nfor i = 1, 2, 3,\n\nP(12) \u2229 Ai 6= \u2205 for i = 4, 5, 6,\n\n(34)\n\nP(13) \u2229 Ai 6= \u2205 for i = 7, 8, 9.\nFor i = 1, . . . , 9, let Yi be the subvariety of X 3 (G) consisting of pictures P for\nwhich the conditionTinvolving Ai is satisfied. Then the problem is to determine the\ncardinality of Y = i Yi . Each Yi is the pullback of some \u03a9w \u2282 F l1,2 (C4 ), so its\n\n\fON THE TOPOLOGY OF GRAPH PICTURE SPACES\n\n21\n\ncohomology class is a Schubert polynomial in the variables x1 , x2 , x3 , z12 , z13 . For\ninstance,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[Y1 ] = \u03c01,12 \u22121 (\u03a92134 ) = S2134 (x1 , z12 \u2212 x1 ) = x1\nand\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22121\n[Y4 ] = \u03c01,12 (\u03a91324 ) = S1324 (x1 , z12 \u2212 x1 ) = z12 .\nThe other classes [Yi ] may be calculated similarly. In summary,\n[Y1 ] = x1 ,\n\n[Y4 ] = [Y5 ] = [Y6 ] = z12 ,\n\n[Y2 ] = x2 ,\n\n[Y7 ] = [Y8 ] = [Y9 ] = z13 ,\n\n[Y3 ] = x3 .\n3 3\nTherefore [Y ] = x1 x2 x3 z12\nz13 . By Proposition 19, the cohomology class of a point\n3\n3\n3 3\nin X (G) is (x1 x2 x3 ) . Since x1 x2 x3 z12\nz13 = 4(x1 x2 x3 )3 in H \u2217 (X 3 (G)), we conclude that |Y | = 4. That is, there are four pictures of G satisfying the conditions (34). (For this and many similar computations, we used the computer algebra\nsystem Macaulay [1]).\n\nThis calculation can be explained purely geometrically, in the spirit of the classical Schubert calculus. First, we specialize to the case that the lines A4 and A5\nmeet in a point, as do A7 and A8 . It is a fact that if there are four solutions to\nthe constraints (34) under this specialization, then there are four solutions without\nit. (In Schubert's terminology, this is the \"principle of conservation of number\";\nsee [9].)\nWe will describe the set J12 of locations for P(1) for which the conditions on\nP(12) can be satisfied. That is, J12 consists of all points p \u2208 A1 such that there\nexists a line l through p meeting each of A4 , A5 , A6 nontrivially. There are two\npossibilities:\nCase 1: p \u2208 A1 \u2229 Q, where Q is the plane containing A4 and A5 . Then there is\nprecisely one possibility for the line l: it must be the unique line determined by p\nand the point A6 \u2229 Q. Note that l \u2282 Q, so both l \u2229 A4 and l \u2229 A5 are nonempty.\nCase 2: p \u2208 A1 \u2229 R, where R is the plane determined by the point a = A4 \u2229 A5\nand the line A6 . Again, this choice of p determines l uniquely: it is the line\ndetermined by p and a. Note that l \u2282 R, so l \u2229 A6 6= \u2205.\nThus J12 is the union of two lines in A1 . By an identical argument, the set J13\nof points for which the conditions on P(13) can be satisfied is also the union of\ntwo lines in A1 . Therefore J = J12 \u2229 J13 consists of four points in A1 . For each\npoint p \u2208 J, there is a unique picture of G satisfying all the conditions of (34), with\nP(1) = p. The case analysis above tells us how to choose P(12) and P(13), and\nP(2) and P(3) must be respectively P(12) \u2229 A2 and P(13) \u2229 A3 .\nThis geometric result verifies ex post facto that the subvarieties Yi of Example 20\nintersect transversely, so that the above cohomological calculation is valid. It would\nbe interesting to discover whether such transversality holds for all orchard Schubert\nvarieties.\n8. Some Open Problems\n1. What aspects of the graph- or matroid-theoretic structure of G (other than\nits d-parallel behavior) can be read off from the Poincar\u00e9 series of X d (G)? For instance, can the Tutte polynomial itself be recovered from the Poincar\u00e9 series? This\n\n\f22\n\nJEREMY L. MARTIN\n\nseems intuitively unlikely because X d (G) involves one fewer variable than TG (x, y).\nHowever, the author's experimentation has thus far produced no counterexample.\n2. Theorem 14 may be read as saying that the d-parallel behavior of a graph is\nencapsulated in the structure of the corresponding graphic matroid (which is less\ninformation than the structure of the graph itself!) Accordingly, given an arbitrary\nmatroid M , can one define the \"d-parallel matroid\" of M , with the same ground\nset, purely in terms of the Tutte polynomial? (This idea was suggested to the\nauthor independently by M. Haiman and V. Reiner.) If so, what is the geometric\nmeaning of such a combinatorial object?\n3. Some of the material of Section 7 may warrant further investigation. Most\nglaring is the lack of a Schubert calculus for graphs other than orchards, for which\nthe picture space is singular. In addition, one might study the \"quasi-Bruhat\" poset\nassociated with an orchard, as in Example 18 above.\nReferences\n1.
