Here photons are converted\ninto an unseen particle during transit. This mechanism is\nbased on a generic interaction between the photon and a\npseudo-scalar field. Other cosmological consequences of\nthis pseudo-scalar (p-p) coupling include Faraday-like rotations, spontaneous generation of polarization, and primordial magnetic fields generation [6, 7, 8, 9].\nMediated by an external magnetic field, this coupling\nalso produces the conversion that dims supernovae. This\nmechanism is similar to that exploited by axion direct\ndetection experiments [10] but in the reverse direction.\nPrevious works examining the viability of this alternative\ndimming mechanism have largely focused on constraints\nfrom the observed achromaticity of the dimming [11, 12].\nIn this Paper, we reconsider this alternate mechanism\nin light of recent cosmological measurements. First, we\nshow that there exists large regions in the parameter\nspace that both satisfy current luminosity distance measurements and avoid achromaticity constraints by saturating the conversion. Hence exclusion of this alternate\nexplanation solely through supernovae data is difficult.\nOn the other hand, cosmological probes of acceleration that do not involve luminosity distances are immune\nto dimming effects. Specifically, expansion history constraints based on angular diameter distances from the\nmeasurement of standard rulers can be used to directly\ntest the dimming hypothesis. The acoustic oscillations\nset by the photon-baryon fluid before recombination im-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: ysong@cfcp.uchicago.edu\naddress: whu@background.uchicago.edu\n\nprints the sound horizon as a standard ruler in both the\ncosmic microwave background and galaxy power spectra.\nWe combine measurements from WMAP [13] which give\nthe angular diameter distance to recombination with the\nrecent detection of baryon oscillations in the SDSS LRG\ngalaxy survey [14] which provides the distance ratio between the galaxies and the CMB.\nOur result exclude a non-accelerating species of dark\nenergy at the 4\u03c3 level even allowing for the possibility of\nphoton conversion. Furthermore, within the 95% confidence limits there exists separate solutions with no dimming and strong dimming of supernovae both of which\nrequire cosmic acceleration. These possibilities can be\ndistinguished in the future with better constraints from\nthe acoustic oscillations.\nIn an Appendix, we also consider spectral constraints\nfrom COBE FIRAS on the dimming of the CMB itself. These constraints, which are more robust than\nand equally powerful compared to CMB anisotropy constraints [5], are useful for eliminating astrophysically disfavored regions of the parameter space that involve large\nexternal magnetic fields with a short coherence length.\n\nII.\n\nPHOTON-PSEUDO SCALAR CONVERSION\n\nWe study the interaction between photons and a\npseudo-scalar field \u03c6 through\nZ\n\u221a h1\n1\nS =\nd4 x \u2212g \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n2\n2\ni\n\u03c6\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n(1)\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F +\n4\n4M\nwhere F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 12 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b1\u03b2 and \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the Levi-Civita\ntensor.\nIn a small patch where the effect of the cosmic expansion is negligible, the equation of motion for \u03c6 is\n\u22022\u03c6\n1 ~ ~\n\u2212 \u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212m2 \u03c6 \u2212\nE * B.\n\u2202t2\nM\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\n~ is a combination of the internal\nThe magnetic field B\nmagnetic field of the radiation and any external magnetic field that might exist.

If this ratio is large, then\nthe spatially oscillating piece in the conversion probability Eqn.

Since the mixing angle scales with the plasma frequency as given in Eqn. (7),\nwe will take a fiducial value of ne0 = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22123\nwith the understanding that other cases may be obtained\nby replacing\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nne0\n\u03bc\u2192\u03bc\n.\n(11)\n2.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22123\n\n\f3\nNote that in this limit, the conversion probability in\na single domain is highly chromatic with a scaling of\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 \u221d \u03c9 2 [11].\nAs an aside, there is also empirical evidence disfavoring dimming in the opposite limit of s \u226a lp . Here\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 \u2248 4s2 \u03bc2 and becomes independent of frequency.\nHence low frequency photons from cosmological sources\ncan be substantially dimmed. The blackbody nature of\nthe CMB places significant constraints on dimming in\nthis regime. In the Appendix we show that\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 (\u03c9CMB ) < 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n(95%CL) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c9CMB = 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV. If at \u03c9CMB the coherence length is still s \u226a lp then substantial dimming of\nsupernovae would be completely ruled out.\nUnder the assumption that the transition s \u223c lp lies\nsomewhere between the optical and CMB frequencies,\nthis constraint translates to one on lp0 /s through\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 (\u03c9CMB )\n\u22482\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 (\u03c9SN )\n\n\u0012\n\nlp0 \u03c9CMB\ns \u03c9SN\n\n\u00132\n\nD(zCMB ) 2\na , (13)\nD(zSN ) SN\n\nwhere D(z) is the comoving distance to redshift z, lp0\nis evaluated at the SN frequency, and zCMB is the highest redshift for which the magnetic field persists. Note\nthat this 10\u22124 constraint from spectral distortions is\nmore robust than and equally powerful compared with\nconstraints based on the angular variation of the dimming. Although the latter lie at an amplitude of 10\u22125 ,\nanisotropy measurements are typically taken at a frequency that is up to an order of magnitude smaller\n\n(30GHz vs 300GHz). The strong frequency scaling of\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 \u221d \u03c9 2 more than compensates the lower precision of the spectral measurements. With supernovae\nat zSN \u2248 0.5 dimmed by order unity and assuming\nzCMB is high, e.g. comparable to the reionization redshift,\ns/lp > 1/10.

The ellipses at the intersection denote the combination of all constraints.\n\nmagnetic domain between the observer and the source at\na comoving distance D(z). Here S = si /ai is the assumed\nconstant coherence length in comoving coordinates.\nAs can be seen\n\u221a in Eqn. (16), the total conversion is\na function of \u03bc f . In the top panel of Fig 1, we show\nthe\n\u221a conversion as a function of z for several choices of\n\u03bc f . Given a limit on the mass scale of the coupling of\nM \u2265 2\u00d71019 eV [17, 18], the magnetic field strength must\nbe of order 10\u221210 Gauss to establish a substantial conversion across a cosmological distance. This is a plausible\nstrength for the intergalactic field.\nThe bottom panel of Fig 1 shows that the dimming\nproduced by an accelerating component of dark energy\nwith an equation of state w = p/\u03c1 < \u22121/3 and by the p-p\ncoupling with w > \u22121/3 looks almost identical (see the\nfollowing section for model details). We would expect,\nas shown explicitly in the next section, that both scenarios would be equally favored by the luminosity distance\nmeasures alone.\nTo mimic cosmic acceleration, the dimming must also\nbe achromatic. Although the conversion probability in an\nindividual domain is highly chromatic, the net dimming\nneed not be so. The conversion probability equilibrates\nat 1/3 due to the oscillation of the pseudo-scalar back to\na photon. Once the conversion probability is saturated,\nthe dimming becomes achromatic.\n\u221a\nWith a sufficiently large \u03bc f achromaticity can be\nachieved at a sufficiently low redshift to avoid observational constraints. Observations limit the magnitude difference of the dimming between B(0.44\u03bcm) and\nV(0.55\u03bcm) bands to be at most 0.03 [11]. But as we\nsee in the middle panel of Fig 1, once the conversion\n\nprobability reaches the saturation limit, the difference in\ndimming between the bands disappears.\nThus in terms of supernovae data alone, dimming by\nthe p-p coupling and cosmic acceleration are equally favored.\nIV.\n\nMODEL CONSTRAINTS\n\nWe now explore the allowed parameter space of p-p\ndimming and cosmic acceleration models. The cosmic\nacceleration is parametrized by the dark energy equation\nof state w = p/\u03c1 and the non-relativistic energy density\nrelative to critical \u03a9m in a flat universe.\nThe p-p dim\u221a\nming model is parameterized by \u03bc f . For simplicity,\nwe will fix f = 2/3 and quote the allowed region in \u03bc\nevaluated at the present epoch.\nFirst, we use the gold set of the supernovae data alone\n[4]. When we consider the supernovae dimming just by\nthe cosmic acceleration, a phantom dark energy model\nwith w < \u22121 is marginally favored as shown in the left\npanel of Fig 2 (see e.g. [19]). It is interesting to note\nthat the bolometric dimming of the supernovae most favored by the cosmic acceleration scenario is statistically\nindistinguishable from the best fit p-p coupling scenario\nwith w = \u22120.2 and no acceleration, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig 1. This degeneracy is quantified in the\ntop-left panel in Fig 3. It shows that the cosmic acceleration by the phantom dark energy model with the negligible p-p coupling is almost equally favored compared with\nstrong p-p coupling with no cosmic acceleration [20]. The\ntwo appear as discrete solutions with the \u039bCDM model\n\n\f5\nin the weakly disfavored intermediate regime.\nOther cosmological tests are required to break this degeneracy. We next combine the luminosity distance measured by the supernovae with the angular diameter distance measured by CMB. The angular diameter distance\nat recombination z\u2217 , DA (z\u2217 ) is given by fitting the CMB\nacoustic structures. We can estimate DA (z\u2217 ) based upon\nthe cosmological parameter \u03c9m = \u03a9m h2 = 0.135 \u00b1 0.008\nwhich controls the physical extent of the sound horizon\nas well as the redshift of recombination and its measured\nangular scale lA = 301 \u00b1 1 [13, 21].\nThe right panel in Fig 2 and the bottom left panel in\nFig 3 show that the p-p coupling scenario with no cosmic acceleration is now more likely than either phantom\nmodels or \u039bCDM at w = \u22121 but the latter is still allowed\nat 95% confidence.\n\nFIG. 3: w \u2212 \u03bc constraints at the 68%, 95% and 99% CL. The\nmagnetic field filling fraction f is fixed to 2/3 for simplicity.\n\nA much more direct test of p-p dimming comes from\nangular diameter distance measures to a redshift more\ncomparable to the supernovae. This is provided by the\nrecent detection of baryon oscillations in the SDSS LRG\ngalaxy survey. This measurement can be summarized as\na distance ratio\nR\u2261\n\nDA (z = 0.35)\n= 0.0979 \u00b1 0.0036 .\nDA (z\u2217 )\n\n(17)\n\nWhen this constraint is added in, a non accelerating universe with w \u2265 \u22121/3 is ruled out at the 4 \u03c3 level (see\nFig 2). Interestingly, Fig. 3 shows two separate equally\nfavored solutions: one with negligible dimming and the\nother with strong dimming.\n\nThe favored p-p coupling with the current dataset\n\u221a\nrequires a strong external magnetic field with \u03bc f \u223c\n8\u00d710\u221230 which saturates the conversion probability early\nin redshift. As shown in the middle panel in Fig 1, the\nconversion probability with the strong external magnetic\nfield passes the chromaticity constraint test.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe study an alternative explanation for the dimming\nof supernovae involving the loss of photons to a pseudoscalar field \u03c6 in transit. With only supernovae measurements on the bolometric total dimming and the achromaticity of dimming, solutions without cosmic acceleration exist.\nThis ambiguity in the supernovae data can be resolved\nwith angular diameter distance measures that are based\non a standard length scale instead of a standard candle.\nWe apply the CMB acoustic peaks and the recently detected baryon oscillations as constraints on the model.\nWe also use CMB spectral constraints to eliminate a\nclass of small magnetic field coherence length solutions.\nWe show that the non-accelerating solutions persist when\nadding just the CMB information but are eliminated at\nthe 4\u03c3 level once the baryon oscillations are added.\nIntriguingly solutions with substantial dimming accompanied by cosmic acceleration still exist and could\npotentially bias measurements of the equation of state\nin the negative direction. These models can be tested\nwith future baryon oscillation experiments. Likewise astrophysical sources of non-cosmological dimming such as\ndust extinction can be tested by these means.\n\nAcknowledgments: YS and WH are supported by the\nU.S. Dept. of Energy contract DE-FG02-90ER-40560.\nWH is additionally supported by the Packard Foundation.

A dimming of\ncosmological sources would distort the blackbody spectrum and so in this Appendix we use the COBE FIRAS\ndata shown in Fig. 4 to set limits on dimming scenarios.\nThe p-p coupling dims the CMB spectrum as well as\nthe supernovae light. We introduce the generic parameter A\u03bd representing the amplitude of the dimming of the\nCMB spectrum as\n\u0014\n\nS(\u03bd; T ) = 1 \u2212 A\u03bd\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00112 \u0015\n2hc2 \u03bd 3\n\u03bd\n10cm\u22121\nexp(hc\u03bd/kT ) \u2212 1\n\n\f6\nwhere the frequency \u03bd is measured in cm\u22121 . Our linearized fit includes three unknown parameters, \u2206T the\ntemperature variation from T0 = 2.726K, A\u03bd and the\nlevel of residual galaxy emission G0 . The form is\n\u0014\n\u0010 \u03bd \u00112 \u0015\n\u2202B\u03bd\nB\u03bd (T0 ) + \u2206T\n+ G0 g(\u03bd), ,\nI0 (\u03bd) = 1 \u2212 A\u03bd\n10\n\u2202T\nwhere B\u03bd (T0 ) is the blackbody spectrum and g(\u03bd) is a\ngalaxy emission spectrum. We assume a fixed galaxy\nemission spectrum over the sky as given in [23].\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the best fit model is a pure blackbody spectrum of T0 = 2.726K with a small high frequency galaxy emission contamination. However the\nshape of the linear distortion by a temperature uncertainty \u2206T is mildly degenerate with A\u03bd . Constraints on\nA\u03bd are limited by this degeneracy as shown in Fig. 4. We\nobtain A\u03bd = 1.0\u00d710\u22125 \u00b12.5\u00d710\u22124 at the 95% confidence\nlevel.\n\nFIG. 4: Residuals I0 (\u03bd) \u2212 B\u03bd (T0 ) compared with model distortions.

This deviation\nis composed of compensating changes from the temperature\nvariation \u2206T , the p-p dimming A\u03bd , and the galactic component G0 as shown.\n\n[1] S. Perlmutter et al.
