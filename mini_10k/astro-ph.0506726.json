Drew et al.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe astronomical significance of H\u03b1 spectral line emission is\nthat it both traces diffuse ionized nebulae and is commonly\nprominent in the spectra of pre- and post-main-sequence\nstars and binaries. Since these are objects in relatively shortlived phases of evolution, they are a minority in a mature\ngalaxy like our own. Their scarcity has in turn acted as a\nbrake on our understanding of these crucial evolutionary\nstages that in youth help shape the growth of planetary\nsystems, and in old age determine stellar end states and\nthe recycling of energy and chemically-enriched matter back\ninto the galactic environment. The major groups of emission\nline stars include all evolved massive stars (supergiants, luminous blue variables, Wolf-Rayet stars, various types of\nBe star), post-AGB stars, pre-main-sequence stars at all\nmasses, active stars and interacting binaries. This last group\nmost likely harbours SN Ia progenitors within it, in guises\nthat are still subject to considerable debate (Hillebrandt &\nNiemeyer 2000; Uenishi, Nomoto & Hachisu 2003).\nExisting catalogues of emission line objects contain anything from a few, to a few hundred, sources. Within the least\npopulous object classes (e.g. the luminous blue variables and\nsupersoft X-ray binaries, with just a few of each known in\nthe Galaxy) there can be a confusing m\u00eal\u00e9e of 'special cases'\nthat inhibit confident identification of essential and general\nbehaviours. In effect, stellar evolutionary studies have been\nbedevilled by small number statistics and a lack of good demographics. The remedy for this problem is to exploit the\ntechnical developments of recent years that have boosted\nboth the efficiency with which large scale astronomical surveys can be performed, and the quality that can be achieved.\nIn particular, large area CCD-mosaic detectors offering good\nspatial resolution have now completely supplanted the photographic techniques of the last century. In this paper, we\ndescribe the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H\u03b1\nSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS), a programme that began taking data with the INT Wide Field\nCamera in the second half of 2003.\nThe goal of IPHAS is to survey the entire northern\nGalactic Plane in the latitude range \u22125o < b < +5o \u2013 a\nsky area of 1800 sq.deg. The choice of latitude range was\ntensioned between the rising total telescope time requirement and the expected fall off in discoveries to be made with\nincreasing latitude (see below). The 10-degree wide strip requires in the region of 22 weeks clear time, and the hope is to\ncomplete the observations before the end of 2006. The data\nobtained will be mined both for spatially-resolved nebulae\nand for unresolved emission line stars. For point sources, the\n\u2032\nmagnitude range will be 13 <\n\u223c r <\n\u223c 20. Here we will focus\non presenting the basic features of the survey, together with\nthe extraction of point source data and the analysis of photometric colour information. The different technical issues\nrelating to the identification and measurement of resolved\nH\u03b1-emitting nebulae will be presented in a later paper. For\nnow, we just point to the opportunity that IPHAS presents\nboth for making new discoveries and for high quality H\u03b1\nemission mapping on large angular scales.\nTo place this new northern hemisphere survey in context, it is appropriate to review the scale and character of the\nemission line star population that previous Galactic H\u03b1 surveys have revealed. Kohoutek & Wehmeyer (1999, hereafter\n\nKW99) have added their own discoveries within the latitude\nrange \u221210o < b < +10o (1979 objects; data obtained in the\nyears 1964-1970) to those of a wide range of independent\nsearches: these go back as far as the original work of Merrill & Burwell that resulted in the Mount Wilson Catalogue\n(MWC, see Merrill & Burwell 1933). The total number of\nKW99 objects is 4174. In many cases the source observations are spectra obtained using objective prism facilities.\nFor sources in the northern hemisphere, this compilation\nsupercedes that due to Wackerling (1970). Three-quarters\nof the stars listed in KW99 are assigned a photovisual magnitude, mpv < 13, and it is surmised that this is roughly the\ncatalogue's completeness limit. They also note that over 80\npercent of all the objects they list in the \u221210o < b < +10o\nband fall within the narrower \u22125o < b < +5o band. At\nthe fainter magnitudes we are exploring, we might expect\nthis concentration toward the Galactic Equator to become\neven more pronounced. Naive extrapolation of the brightend (mpv < 13) magnitude distribution of the KW99 emission line stars to span 13 < mpv < 20 would suggest that\nour survey should uncover 8000\u201310000 new objects.\nThis is probably an underestimate for a number of reasons. First, we can check this extrapolation of KW99 against\nthe same quantity derived from the Stephenson & Sanduleak (1971, hereafter SS71) southern Galactic Plane survey.\nThe SS71 completeness limit is shallower at mpg \u223c 11. We\nfind, even on excluding the Galactic Bulge region located\nexclusively in the southern sky, that the prediction rises to\n\u223c40000. This dramatic difference can have a number of origins \u2013 beginning with simple differences in the Galactic stellar populations accessible from the northern and southern\nhemispheres, and ending with issues of experimental technique. Nevertheless a parallel between the KW99 and SS71\ncatalogues is that the bright magnitudes sampled strongly\nfavour early-type, intrinsically luminous stars (such objects\naccount for three-quarters of the KW99 catalogue). On going\nto much fainter magnitudes the sampled emission line star\npopulation is likely to broaden in character as intrinsically\nfainter object types (e.g. young and active stars, interacting\nbinaries) become included.\nAn immediate precursor to IPHAS and, indeed, a\nprompt for the need for a northern survey, is the\nAAO/UKST narrow-band H\u03b1 Survey of the Southern\nGalactic Plane and Magellanic Clouds. This was the last\nphotographic sky survey carried out on the UK Schmidt\nTelescope (UKST). It was completed in 2003 and is now\navailable as digital survey data derived from SuperCOSMOS\nscans of the original survey films (the SHS database, located\nat http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/halpha/). A description\nof this survey is presented by Parker et al (2005): important\npoints to note are its high spatial resolution (\u223c 1 arcsec) and\nits areal completeness \u2013 the entire southern Galactic Plane\nwas imaged within the latitude range \u221210\u25e6 < b < +10\u25e6 .\nEach of the 233 Galactic Plane fields observed had an effective dimension projected on the sky of 4\u25e6 \u00d7 4\u25e6 . The southern survey has provided the source material for a variety\nof continuing research projects (see e.g. Morgan, Parker &\nRusseil 2001; Parker & Morgan 2003; Drew et al 2004). For\nthe detection of point sources, IPHAS betters both the SHS\nsensitivity and spatial resolution, and offers the advantage\nof CCD dynamic range and linearity. The sensitivity of the\ntwo surveys to spatially-resolved H\u03b1 emission is comparable.\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Following this, in section 3,\nwe discuss the use of the H\u03b1,r \u2032 ,i\u2032 filter photometry in the\ndiagnostic (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) versus (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) diagrams that can be\nconstructed from the survey data for point sources. Specifically, we introduce simulated colour-colour tracks for both\nnormal solar-metallicity stars occupying the main stellar locus and for emission line objects. We then provide examples\nof (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) diagrams in three contrasting northern\nGalactic plane locations (sections 4 to 6). The fields discussed are identified in Table 1. In section 4, we illustrate\nthe application of the simulated tracks for normal stars with\nreference to fields in Aquila; in section 5 we perform a consistency check of IPHAS photometry of a Taurus field obtained on a photometric night; and in section 6 we present\nsome follow-up spectroscopy relating to a field in Cepheus\nthat illustrates the high success rate achieved in the confirmation of candidate emission line objects. In Section 7,\nwe outline the application of IPHAS to imaging spatiallyresolved nebulae, and illustrate this with the beautiful example of the supernova remnant, S 147. The paper ends with\na summarising discussion (Section 8).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSURVEY OBSERVATIONS AND DATA\nEXTRACTION\nIPHAS observations\n\nThe Wide Field Camera, mounted on the 2.5-metre Isaac\nNewton Telescope, is an imager comprising 4 AR-coated,\nthinned 4K \u00d7 2K EEV CCDs arranged in an L shape, capturing data from an on-sky area of approximately 0.3 of\na square degree. With a pixel dimension of 13.5 \u03bcm, corresponding on-sky to 0.333\u00d70.333 arcsec2 , the instrument\nis appropriately configured to fully exploit the high quality\nsub-arcsecond seeing frequently encountered at the Roque\nde los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma. Adequately\nsampled \u223c1 arcsec resolution is particularly useful given that\nlower-reddening Galactic Plane star fields, observed down to\n\u223c20th magnitude, are at times very crowded.\nNot accounting for the geometric consequences of the\nL-shaped detector arrangement, the total number of pointings required to span the 10\u00d7180 deg2 survey area would be\n6000.

Furthermore, each\npointing is paired with a second pointing at an offset of 5\narcmin W and 5 arcmin S, such that the number of qualitycontrolled sets of exposures expected to be compiled into\nthe final survey database is 15270. Stars falling into a gap\nbetween the mosaiced CCDs in one exposure are captured\nin a partner exposure set. Nevertheless the great majority\nof Galactic Plane sources will be imaged at least twice. The\npairing and offsetting, together with the chosen tessellation,\ncomes very close to complete coverage of the northern Plane\n(> 99 %).\nSince H\u03b1 falls in the red part of the spectrum, IPHAS\nwas conceived of as a large-scale programme that could\nreadily make use of less heavily subscribed bright and grey\nnights. To ensure this scheduling flexibility, whilst obtaining\nthe associated continuum-band observations required for establishing unambiguous H\u03b1 excesses, it was decided to restrict our broadband choices to red or longer wavelengths.\nThis also has the effect of increasing the penetration of the\nsurvey for a given exposure time since these longer wavelengths are also less subject to Galactic dust obscuration\nthan UBV bands. This stands in contrast to the somewhat\nbluer emphases of the older H\u03b1 catalogues (e.g. SS71, where\nthe objective prism data spanned 3300 < \u03bb(\u00c5)< 6800). The\nparticular choice we made was to obtain the H\u03b1 exposures\nalongside Sloan r \u2032 and i\u2032 filter observations.\nAll three filter profiles are plotted as Fig. 1. The Sloan\nfilters have been preferred over Harris alternatives because of\ntheir squarer transmission profiles. The Sloan r \u2032 filter is the\nmost blue-sensitive of the three (central wavelength 6240 \u00c5),\nwith the H\u03b1 filter positioned toward the red end of its bandpass (central wavelength 6568 \u00c5). With a full-width at halfmaximum (FWHM) transmission of 95 \u00c5, the H\u03b1 filter is\nmore than broad enough to capture all likely Doppler shifts\ndue to Galactic motions of up to a few hundred km s\u22121 or\n\u223c10 \u00c5, as well as blueshifts of up to an additional \u223c10 \u00c5\ndue to the converging beam of the INT/WFC. The central wavelength of the Sloan i\u2032 filter is 7743 \u00c5. We have\nadded two broad band filters to this survey in order to give\na continuum-dominated colour with which the (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) excess measurement can be compared. It has been shown in the\npast (see e.g. Robertson & Jordan 1989) that this is important for distinguishing between a genuine H\u03b1 emission excess\nand a molecular band dominated late type stellar spectrum\n\n\f4\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\nFigure 1. The transmission profiles of the H\u03b1, Sloan r \u2032 and\ni\u2032 filters used in all IPHAS observations. The r \u2032 and i\u2032 filter profiles are plotted as solid lines, whilst the H\u03b1 profile is\nshown dashed. The dotted line is the mean WFC CCD response at the cooled working temperature. These profiles are\navailable in numerical form from the INT/WFC web page,\nhttp://www.ing.iac.es/\u223cquality/filter/filt4.html\n\n\u2013 in such cases large (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) 'colour' will correlate with\nrelatively extreme (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ). In truth, the diagnostic value of\nthis strategy is wider than this, as shall become apparent in\nSection 3.\nThe exposure times in the three filters were set at\n120 sec (H\u03b1) and 10 sec (r \u2032 and i\u2032 ) for the first season's\nobserving in 2003. Evaluation of these data, once extracted,\nled us to increase the r \u2032 band exposure to 30 secs, from the\nstart of the 2004 observing season, to compensate better for\ntheir typically higher moonlit background. This adjustment\nalso acknowledges the pivotal role the r \u2032 band exposures\nmust play in the survey's exploitation \u2013 it is important that\nerrors in this band, appearing in both the H\u03b1 excess and the\nbroadband colour measurement, are minimised.\nFor the purpose of photometric calibration, each night's\nobservations includes standard fields, obtained in twilight\nand at intervals of approximately 2 hours through the\nnight. The standards are chosen from a list including the\nLandolt equatorial fields (Landolt 1992), Sloan (Smith et\nal 2002) and Stetson standards (at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre, http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/standards/).\nNightly observations are also acquired of spectrophotometric standards with a view to assisting the final calibration\nof the narrow-band H\u03b1 data. A programme of supporting\nspectrophotometric observations is planned with a view to\nplacing the H\u03b1 calibration on the desired firm footing in the\nlonger term.\n2.2\n\nData processing\n\nProcessing of IPHAS INT WFC data generally follows\nthe pipeline procedure devised by Irwin and Lewis (2001)\nfor dealing with optical mosaic camera data. The twodimensional instrumental signature removal includes provision for: non-linearity correction at the detector level; bias\nand overscan correction prior to trimming to the active de-\n\ntector areas; flatfielding; and fringe removal in the i\u2032 passband.\nFlatfielding in all bands is accomplished by stacking\nsuitable twilight flatfield exposures taken over the course of\neach typically one-week observing run to create master calibration flats. These have been found to be stable on this\ntimescale provided no filter changes, or other instrumental\nsetup changes, occur in the middle of the run. The gain\ndifferences between each detector in each passband are removed by normalising a robust measure of the average sky\nlevel for each detector to a common system (in this case the\nsky level on CCD no. 1). The flatfielded i\u2032 data, even for the\nshort exposures (10 s) used here, show measurable fringing.\nAt the same time, the data taken for the IPHAS project are\nnot themselves suitable (short exposures in crowded Galactic Plane regions) to construct good quality fringe maps for\ncorrecting this problem. Since the fringing in the i\u2032 band\nis relatively stable with time, we make use of a library of\ni\u2032 band fringe maps taken from other observing runs using\nthe INT WFC. These have been found to reduce the level of\nfringing to an acceptable level when used with the defringing\nalgorithm in the pipeline.\nEach master flat, in conjunction with a previously defined bad column list, is also used to construct confidence\nmaps for each passband. These are used during the catalogue generation to flag less reliable pixels in each image by\nproviding a measure of the inverse variance weight for each\npixel e.g. bad pixels have zero weight, heavily vignetted regions have low weight, poor DQE pixels have lower weight,\nand so on. These confidence measures are used directly to\nweight the image detection part of the catalogue generation\nalgorithm and help avoid generating excessive numbers of\nspurious images around defects and other excessively noisy\nregions.\nCatalogue generation follows the precepts outlined by\nIrwin (1985, 1997) and includes the facility to: automatically track any background variations on scales of typically\n20\u201330 arcsec; detect and deblend images or groups of images; and parameterise the detected images to give various\n(soft-edged) aperture fluxes, position and shape measures.\nThe generated catalogues start with an approximate World\nCoordinate System (WCS) defined by the known telescope\nand camera properties (eg. WCS distortion model) and are\nthen progressively refined using all-sky astrometric catalogues (eg. USNO, APM, 2MASS) to give internal precision\ngenerally better than 0.1 arcsec and global external precision of 0.25 arcsec with respect to USNO and APM, and\n0.1 arcsec with respect to 2MASS. These latter numbers are\nsolely dependent on the accuracy of the astrometric catalogues used in the refinement.\nAll catalogues for all CCDs for each pointing are then\nprocessed using the image shape parameters for morphological classification in the main categories: stellar; non-stellar;\nnoise-like. A sampled curve-of-growth for each detected object is derived from a series of aperture flux measures as a\nfunction of radius. The classification is then based on comparing the curve-of-growth of the flux for each detected object with the well-defined curve-of-growth for the general\nstellar locus. This latter is a direct measure of the integral\nof the point spread function (PSF) out to various radii and\nis independent of magnitude, if the data are properly linearised, and if saturated images are excluded. The average\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\nFigure 2. Magnitude and colour errors in IPHAS data as a function of magnitude. The quantity shown, for each filter in the top\n3 panels, is the rms deviation per magnitude bin, between the\nmeasured magnitudes for each of IPHAS fields 2540 and 2540o.\nThe lower two panels show the colour rms deviations. The bin\nsize is 0.5 magnitudes for all but the i\u2032 data, where a binning\nof 0.25 magnitudes was more convenient. See further discussion\nof fields 2540/2540o in section 5. These data were obtained on a\nphotometric night in November 2003. The r \u2032 exposure times were\n10 sec in this case.\n\nstellar locus on each detector is clearly defined and is used\nas the basis for a null hypothesis stellar test for use in classification. The curve-of-growth for stellar images is also used\nto automatically estimate frame-based aperture corrections\nfor conversion to total flux. 1\nAny photometric standards observed during the run\n(mainly Landolt 1992 and spectrophotmetric standards) are\nautomatically located in a standards database and used to\nestimate the zero-point in each passband for every pointing\ncontaining any of these standards. The trend in the derived\nzero-points is then used to assign a photometric quality index for each night and also as a first pass estimate for the\nmagnitude calibration for all the observations. The H\u03b1 filter is treated as equivalent to a standard Johnson-Cousins\nR-band filter to obtain a Vega-like magnitude which is used\nas an initial calibration (to be refined later, as mentioned\nabove).\nVarious quality control plots are generated by the\npipeline and these are used to monitor characteristics, such\n\n5\n\nas:- the seeing; the average stellar image ellipticity (to measure trailing); the sky brightness and sky noise; the size of\naperture correction for use with the \"optimal\" aperture flux\nestimates (here \"optimal\" refers to the well-known property\nthat soft-edged apertures of roughly the average seeing radius provide close to profile fit accuracy eg. Naylor 1998).\nThe \"optimal\" catalogue fluxes for the r \u2032 , i\u2032 and H\u03b1 filters\nfor each field are then combined to produce a single matched\nmerged catalogue from which diagnostic colour-magnitude\ndiagrams and two-colour diagrams may be produced. These\nmerged catalogues \u2013 the fundamental IPHAS product \u2013 contain flux, classification and match position error for each\nobject in each passband.\nThe\nIAU-registered\nnaming\nconvention for all point sources derived from these catalogues is\nIPHAS JHHMMSS.ss+DDMMSS.s \u2013 thereby encoding the\n2000 object co-ordinates into the name.\nTo give an impression of the internal magnitude errors\nin the catalogued magnitudes and derived colours we plot, in\nFig. 2, the rms deviation between the magnitudes measured\nin each filter, and the associated colours, for point sources\ncommon to two overlapping exposure sets (fields 2540 and\n2540o, discussed again in Section 5). These were obtained\non a photometric night in November\np 2003 as the moon was\nsetting. Calculated empirically as < (m2540 \u2212 m2540o )2 >\nor its colour equivalent, over a range in mean magnitude\n\u2206m = 0.5 or \u2206m = 0.25, the error is corrected back to a\nrepresentative\nsingle field measurement error by dividing by\n\u221a\n2. The bright-end errors in the magnitudes themselves, in\nplots such as these, are typically dominated by calibration\noffsets of a few hundredths that will be removed when a\nfinal uniform survey calibration is devised. In the case of\nfields 2540 and 2540o the offsets were all small (less than\n\u223c 0.01). From 2004 on, when the r \u2032 exposures were increased\nto 30 sec, the faint-end r \u2032 errors drop to around 60% of\nthose for 2003 (for the same sky conditions). This carries\nthrough to the colour errors falling to 80% or less of their\n2003 levels. Altogether, this significantly raises the fraction\nof catalogued objects that will meet the quality target of\n\u2206r \u2032 \u2264 0.1 for r \u2032 \u2264 20.\nTo date roughly 3 Tbytes of raw data from the first\ntwo seasons of IPHAS observing have been processed this\nway. This corresponds to well over 100,000 4kx2k CCD\nimages and over 40 million objects have been catalogued.\nAll of this processed data is also available at the individual frame and catalogue level via a PostgreSQL database\ninterface which allows users to: postage stamp browse for\ncandidate verification; construct image catalogue overlays,\nincluding on-the-fly matching with other catalogues such\nas the 2MASS point source catalogue; perform on-demand\ncontinuum image subtraction and mosaicing of larger areas; access all the quality control information; and more\n(see Irwin et al 2005). The database interface is available\non the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU) website, at http://apm2.ast.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wfs/dqc.cgi. Coordinates of the centres of the observed IPHAS fields are\nobtainable there. 2\n\n1\n\nWe note that in regions of intense nebular emission with increasingly short spatial scale variations of the \"background\", automatic detection, parameterisation and classification of objects\nbecomes progressively more unreliable. In such regions continuum\nsubtraction via difference imaging will yield better results.\n\n2\n\nThese are identified via object names taking the form intphas nnnn\u2217, where nnnn is a 4-digit number up to 7635, and \u2217 is\nthe wild card for further characters identifying exposure type.\n\n\f6\n3\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\nSIMULATION OF THE IPHAS\nCOLOUR-COLOUR PLANE\n\nThe three bandpasses of the survey provide the basis for\nthe construction of a number of magnitude-colour diagrams\nand a colour-colour diagram to describe any chosen region in\nthe northern Galactic Plane. Using just the two r \u2032 , i\u2032 , broad\nbandpasses, one may derive colour-magnitude diagrams that\ncan in principle reveal different sequences at different reddenings that may be present in the field under investigation.\nFull exploitation of IPHAS hinges on the colour-colour\nplane involving all three bands. The combination of magnitudes we use is (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) as abscissa and (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) as ordinate, so that objects with H\u03b1 band excesses appear higher\nwithin the diagram, while intrinsically redder or more highly\nreddened objects are over to the right. The most straightforward use that can be made of such diagrams is to pick out for\nspectroscopic follow-up those objects whose (r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1) colour\nplaces them clearly above the main locus of non-emission line\nobjects. Additional information contained within the colourcolour diagrams can lead to identification of more subtle\ncandidate emission line stars and also to a characterisation\nof the stellar populations distributed along the line of sight.\nIn this second sense, IPHAS can also be seen as providing a\nfar-red map of stellar populations in the northern Galactic\nPlane.\nFig. 3 is a composite (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) plot derived\nfrom data obtained in three paired IPHAS fields (fields\n4090/4090o, 4095/4095o and 4199/4199o: see Table 1). In\neach case, catalogues of sources classified by the CASU\npipeline as either 'definitely stellar' or 'probably stellar' were\nextracted from within a 30 x 30 arcmin2 box spanning most\nof the overlap region between the two pointings. For each extracted object, the datum plotted is the mean of the colours\nderived independently from each of the two exposures making up the field pair. The data shown are limited to the\nmagnitude range 13 < r \u2032 < 20, where the error in either\ncolour is kept to less than \u223c0.05 magnitudes. These are representative of the better data in the IPHAS database in that\nthey were obtained on photometric nights in June 2004 at\ntimes of \u223c1 arcsec seeing and low sky background.\nAll three fields are located in the Aquila Rift region,\nand sample sightlines that pass through the outer parts of\nthe molecular cloud. Dame & Thaddeus (1985) noted that\nthis is a nearby (\u223c200 pc) and not particularly opaque cloud\nsystem, presenting around 2 magnitudes of visual extinction\nonly. This is a modest addition to the reddening through the\nremaining Galaxy beyond \u2013 the reddening data of Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner & Davis (1998) indicate maximum visual extinctions, AV ranging from \u223c 5, in 4095, up to \u223c 10, in 4199.\nThe nearby rift cloud is responsible for the lightly-populated\ngap, seen in Fig. 3, between the upper sequence and the\nlower, but much more densely populated strip. The existence of this separation allows a clear demonstration of how\nwell theoretically-synthesised tracks compare with and make\nsense of the photometry.\nTo achieve an understanding of the behaviours seen in\nthe colour-colour domain, we have constructed two types\nof synthetic tracks: the first type concerns the properties of\nnormal stars without H\u03b1 emission, while the second explores\nthe impact of adding narrow H\u03b1 emission to generic stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We present these\n\nFigure 3. A plot of (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) versus (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) for 13,818 point\nsources extracted from the overlap area of the paired exposures\nfor IPHAS fields 4199 (black points), 4090 (red points) and 4095\n(blue points), in Aquila. The sources lie in the magnitude range\n13 < r \u2032 < 20. The colours for each object have been formed\nindependently from each set of H\u03b1, r \u2032 and i\u2032 exposures, and then\naveraged. The median error in either colour is \u223c 0.03 at r \u2032 close to\n19, and only occasionally exceeds 0.06 at the r \u2032 = 20 limit of the\nplot. Note the very well defined upper edge to the upper sequence\n\u2013 this is where unreddened main sequence stars are located. The\nfew stars above it are candidate emission line objects.\n\ntracks below, using the Aquila fields to illustrate the former\nin section 4.\n\n3.1\n\nThe IPHAS colours of normal stars\n\nFor simulating the (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) and (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) colours of normal stars, we have used the library of stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) due to Pickles (1998, hereafter\nP98). At a final binning of 5 \u00c5 the spectra in this library are well enough sampled that we may use them to\ncompute narrow-band H\u03b1 relative magnitudes with confidence, alongside the analogous broadband r \u2032 and i\u2032 quantities. The required numerical filter transmission profiles,\nshown in Fig. 1, are available via the ING WFC web pages\n(http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/instruments/wfc/), as\nis a mean Wide Field Camera CCD response curve. To ensure compliance with the Vega-based zero magnitude scale,\nwe have defined synthetic colour as follows:\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) = \u22122.5 log(\n\n\u03a3Ti\u2032 F\u03bb \u2206\u03bb\n\u03a3Tr\u2032 F\u03bb \u2206\u03bb\n) + 2.5 log(\n)(1)\n\u03a3Tr\u2032 F\u03bb,V \u2206\u03bb\n\u03a3Ti\u2032 F\u03bb,V \u2206\u03bb\n\nwhere Tr\u2032 and Ti\u2032 are the r \u2032 and i\u2032 numerical transmission\nprofiles, after multiplying by the mean WFC CCD response\ncurve, and rebinning to match the P98 spectral library sampling. The SED for Vega, F\u03bb,V , is the appropriately resampled version of that due to Hayes (1985). The (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1)\ncolour is evaluated in the same way, after substituting the\nH\u03b1 numerical profile in place of the i\u2032 profile. Since Vega\nis an A0V star, its SED at H\u03b1 incorporates a strong absorption line feature. Currently, because the CASU pipeline\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\nuses broad-band standard fields to calibrate measured source\nmagnitudes, there is an offset in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) colour between\nthe catalogue data and our simulations. The dominant spectral type in the standard fields will be appreciably later\nthan Vega's A0, with the consequence that the standardstar SEDs will both be redder and less eroded by H\u03b1 line\nabsorption. On this basis one would expect, and we do find,\nthat zero (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) for unreddened main sequence stars corresponds to (r \u2032 \u2212i\u2032 ) \u223c 0.3 (late F), rather than to (r \u2032 \u2212i\u2032 ) = 0\n(Vega, A0V), in plots of IPHAS data obtained in photometric conditions. Hence, on comparing simulated tracks with\nobservation it is necessary to correct for this. The best way\nto do this is to assume that only a shift in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) is\nrequired, given that the calibration of the broadband-only\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) colour should be secure enough (see Section 5 and\nthe discussion of Fig. 9). The shift that needs to be applied\nto theoretical (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) values to match them to observation is then always downwards, varying in amount between\nabout \u22120.10 and \u22120.25.\nWe have simulated tracks for main sequence stars (luminosity class V), giant stars (class III) and supergiants (class\nI) using, for simplicity only, solar metallicity P98 spectra.\nEach sequence has been calculated for a range of reddenings using an R = 3.1 optical-IR extinction law in the form\ngiven by Howarth (1983). The colours derived are given for\nEB\u2212V = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Tables 2 and 3. They are specified at this level of detail because there is no single reddening vector that translates all of a sequence directly onto its\nreddened counterpart. The unreddened dwarf, giant and supergiant sequences are compared in Fig. 4, where it can be\nseen that there is a gradual decrease in track gradient with\nincreasing luminosity class. Nevertheless between mid-F and\nlate-K spectral types there is minimal distinction between\nthe luminosity classes \u2013 this is the regime where H\u03b1 absorption is weak and there is not yet any marked development\nof the molecular band structure that typifies M-type stars.\nThe effect of interstellar extinction on the sequences is\nillustrated in Fig. 5. With increasing reddening, the range of\n(r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) colour spanned by each luminosity-class sequence\ndiminishes. This shrinkage in dynamic range is due to effective wavelength of the r \u2032 bandpass lengthening, and moving\ncloser to the H\u03b1 bandpass as reddening becomes ever more\nextreme. It may be seen in Fig. 5 that the supergiant sequence essentially reddens along itself, while the main and\ngiant sequences shift across in a manner that sweeps out\narea in the colour-colour plane. Also shown in this figure\nis the reddening locus for A0 dwarfs \u2013 for non-degenerate\nstars and binaries this line amounts to an important boundary in that none should drop below it. In practice, stars will\nbe carried into the forbidden domain by a range of types of\nobservational error. Degenerate dwarfs and related objects\nwith stronger H\u03b1 absorption than early A stars would also\nfall below this line.\n3.2\n\nThe IPHAS colours of emission line stars\n\nTo assess the impact on (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) and (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) colours of\nincreasingly strong H\u03b1 emission, we have represented underlying stellar SEDs using simple power laws or, at later\nspectral types, blackbodies. At the acceptable price of some\napproximation, such as ignoring stronger spectral features\nlike the Paschen limit, this approach allows us to explore a\n\n7\n\nbroad range of SEDs flexibly and to quantify thresholds for\nthe straightforward detection of H\u03b1 emission. We present\nresults for 4 simple SEDs: three power laws of the form\nF\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u2212\u03b2 with \u03b2 set equal to 4 (Rayleigh-Jeans case, relevant to the hottest O stars), 3 (appropriate to \u223cA0 stars)\nand 2.3 (the optically thick accretion disk case); a Planck\nfunction at a temperature of 5900 K that is a good match\nto the G2V SED in the P98 library.\nH\u03b1 emission, where present, takes on a wide range of\nprofiles in stellar spectra, and can be practically any width\n\u2013 with FWHM anywhere in the range from a few 10s of km\ns\u22121 up to 1000s. But, for now, we treat the simple limiting\ncase of H\u03b1 emission that is well-contained within the width\nof the INT/WFC narrow-band H\u03b1 filter. The particular realisation used is of a rectangular profile of breadth 25 \u00c5\ncentred at 6570 \u00c5 (note that the effective H\u03b1 filter bandpass is blueshifted for objects observed off-axis, which is why\nthe central wavelength of the WFC filter is accordingly specified as 6568 \u00c5). This yields results negligibly different from\nusing a Gaussian profile.\nThe synthesis of colours consists of the following steps:\nan underlying stellar SED is chosen; a rectangular H\u03b1 emission profile of the desired equivalent width (EW) is superimposed; the resultant artificial spectrum is then reddened\nas required using the reddening law specified in section 3.1;\nfinally, the reddened SED is multiplied by the product of\nthe survey filter profiles and WFC response and integrated\nto form colours as in equation 1. We have not attempted\nto apply this procedure to very late type SEDs dominated\nby molecular bands \u2013 in these stars, neither can the SED\nbe easily parameterised, nor is an objective definition of H\u03b1\nEW straightforward.\nOn the basis of this procedure we have synthesised\ncolours for the same set of reddenings (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0 to\n4 in steps of 1) for each of the 4 adopted stellar SEDs. Our\nresults are presented in Fig. 6 and in Table 4. We find that\nthere is a practical degeneracy between reddening and underlying SED such that a very-nearly unique locus is traced\nat each adopted H\u03b1 emission EW. This means that, in principle, a given location in the colour-colour plane, above the\nmain stellar locus, is associated with a particular H\u03b1 EW.\nA further property of the SED-specified tracks is that\nat EW up to \u223c100 \u00c5, the trend with increasing EW is\nnearly vertical. But as H\u03b1 EW becomes very large, the\ntracks bend toward smaller (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) as the H\u03b1 emission becomes a more significant contributor to the r \u2032 flux. Indeed\nbeyond an EW of 1000 \u00c5 as the switch from a 'stellar' to a\n'nebular' spectrum with little discernable continuum takes\nplace, the bending becomes very extreme. In reality (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\nin the nebular case will also depend somewhat on the relative strength of line emission in the i\u2032 band \u2013 left out of\nconsideration here. The limiting value of (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) in the\nabsence of any continuum is \u223c 3.24 for our synthetic system\nreferred to the Hayes (1985) SED for Vega (see Table 4).\nAt the present time, without a properly defined zero point\nto the H\u03b1 filter magnitudes, this translates to an effective\nobserved upper limit on (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) of around 3.1 \u2013 any value\nappreciably above this signals a problem with the individual\nobject's photometry.\nFinally an important feature to note in the trend in\nIPHAS colours with respect to both emission EW and reddening is that the threshold for the detection of H\u03b1 emission\n\n\f8\n\nJanet E.

The effect of adding in increasing H\u03b1 emission to a range of simplified stellar SEDs. The black lines, representing an unreddened\nmain sequence and the early-A reddening trend, are the expected bounds to the main stellar locus. The dashed lines are lines of constant\nH\u03b1 emission equivalent width, with the label at the left specifying the equivalent width in Angstroms. The vertical coloured lines are, in\neffect, H\u03b1 emission curves of growth for particular choices of underlying SED and reddening: the darker blue lines are for the Rayleigh\nJeans case (F\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u22124 ) at different reddenings; light blue and green lines are for power law indices of -3 and -2.3 respectively, while the\nred lines are the results for a 5900 K blackbody (a G2V star, roughly). The lowest point on each curve corresponds to a narrow net H\u03b1\nabsorption of EW, 10 \u00c5. The reddenings, as E(B \u2212 V ), are specified across the top and refer to each set of coloured lines.\n\nis lowest for bluer and/or less reddened objects (see Fig. 6).\nThis implies, for instance, that IPHAS will pick out faint,\nnearby accreting objects very well indeed down to just a few\nAngstroms EW. Conversely, in the worst case of a densely\npopulated main stellar locus spanning a wide range of reddenings, the EW threshold on the straightfoward detection\nof classical T Tau stars at E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 2 (AV \u223c 6) is\naround 30 \u00c5. Not infrequently, however, at larger (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\n(>\n\u223c 2) the colour-colour plane below the unreddened main se-\n\nquence may be sparsely populated \u2013 the few objects located\nhere could be the result of a combination of anomalous reddening and line emission. Indeed it is generally the case that\nobjects, checked as having reliable photometry, lying outside\nthe bounds of the densely populated main stellar locus for\ntheir field, have a relatively high probability of being interesting in one way or another.\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\n11\n\nTable 4.

For this purpose\nwe have selected some of the highest quality IPHAS observations obtained from pointings in the Aquila Rift region,\nallowing us to exploit its distinctive and easily interpreted\ncolour-colour domain morphologies.\nWe begin with field 4095 in Aquila, included in Fig. 3\nas the blue data points. This field is roughly centred on\nl = 32.5o , b = +4.8o , sampling a region close to the survey's\nGalactic latitude upper limit. The reddening data of Schlegel\net al (1998) indicates that EB\u2212V typically does not exceed\n1.6 in this direction. This makes it the least obscured of the\nthree fields and, correspondingly, the field presenting the\nhighest apparent density of stars (7097 out of the 13818 in\nFig. 3). In Fig. 7 the data on extracted point sources are\ncompared with selected synthetic tracks that have all been\n\nshifted downwards in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) by 0.17 to best match them\nto the data.\nThe upper panel in the Fig. 7 shows the brighter end of\nthe magnitude range (13 < r \u2032 < 18) that includes a modest\nnumber of very nearly unreddened M dwarfs and a much\nlarger number of mainly giant stars. Indeed the M giants\nform a particularly tight sequence at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) >\n\u223c 2.0. This\nsuggests that most of the Galactic reddening along this sight\nline accumulates nearby because, if it were not, we would\nexpect to see a more smeared giant distribution. The simulated giant tracks for EB\u2212V = 1.4 and 1.6 are compared\nwith this very well-defined feature. For (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) <\n\u223c 2 many of\nthe brighter objects will be giants at a plausible reddening;\nbut at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) > 2, the synthesised tracks for M2-5 III stars\nfall too low by \u223c 0.05 in (r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1). A similar problem affects\ncomparisons between synthesised and observed tracks for M\ndwarfs also (see below). At r \u2032 < 18, only one object falls\nsignificantly below the early-A reddening line - it is likely to\nbe a white dwarf or related object.\nThe lower panel in Fig. 7 presents the faint end of the r \u2032\nmagnitude range, with the synthetic main sequence and giant tracks, reddened to E(B \u2212 V ) = 1.6, superimposed. The\nmain locus of observed objects is now a little more steeply\nangled, indicating that these fainter stars include a much\nincreased component of main sequence objects. However, at\nr \u2032 \u2243 20, stars later in spectral type than mid-K are only detectable at E(B \u2212 V ) <\n\u223c 0.8, as evidenced by the scatter of\npoints extending the main stellar locus up to (r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1) \u223c 0.9.\nThe small proportion of the plotted objects falling below the\nearly-A reddening line can be presumed consistent with observational error. The 0.17 offset of the synthesised tracks\nwas determined by optimising the positioning of both this\nnotional line and the unreddened main sequence with respect to the data for r \u2032 \u2264 18. These particular IPHAS observations have captured objects out to the limits of the\nGalactic disc population, such as reddened mid-M giants at\n\u223c 10 kpc, located around 800 pc above the mid-plane at\nabout the location of the far Sagittarius-Carina arm.\nThe more highly reddened Aquila field 4199, centred at\nl = 34.3o , b = +1.8o , provides some degree of contrast with\n4095 and is illustrated in Fig. 8. The reddening here is more\nvariable with position, as well as more extreme. This shows\nitself directly in the broader red giant locus. Superimposed\non the colour-colour plot are synthesised giant-star tracks for\nEB\u2212V = 2.4, and 3.0. The latter value was selected because\nthe maximum Galactic extinction for this field, derived from\nthe Schlegel et al 1998 mapping data, is EB\u2212V \u2243 3.0. There\nis a rough consistency here with the findings from field 4095,\nin that the M giant track synthesised for this extinction falls\na bit below the observed thinning of putative M giants (as\nit did for field 4095). Down to r = 20, the colour-colour\ndata suggest the presence of main sequence stars of K and\nearlier type at reddenings in the range 1.2 <\n\u223c E(B \u2212 V ) <\n\u223c\n2.4: the main sequence tracks for these limits are drawn to\nillustrate this (Fig. 8). This field again bears the imprint\nof the Aquila Rift in the relative deficit of stars between\nthe lightly populated zero-extinction main sequence and the\ndense locus of stars at EB\u2212V >\n\u223c 1.2.\nIn field 4199 it is more apparent that the observed\nunreddened M dwarfs tend to maintain the locus gradient\ndefined at earlier spectral types, rather than begin to turn\nover as the synthesised track indicates they should.

This variability, the anomalously low (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) colour, together with\nits NIR colours, point towards a carbon star at a reddening\ncorresponding to E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 1.4 (see e.g. Bessell & Brett\n1988). A faint-end absolute K magnitude for such a star,\nif on the AGB, would be -6.5 (Claussen et al 1987). This\nplaces it at \u223c15 kpc.\n\n5\n\nFigure 8.

The solid black lines are main sequence tracks for E(B \u2212\nV ) = 0 and 2.4, while the dashed line is the early-A reddening\nline. The two red tracks are giant tracks, for E(B \u2212 V ) = 2.4 and\n3.0. The position of the probable C star discussed in the text is\npicked out by the arrow.\n\nis most likely another symptom of the problem behind the\nM-giant discrepancy. At the present time, the available conversion between Landolt (R \u2212 I) colours, appropriate to the\nstandard star fields, and Sloan (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) are not properly defined for M dwarf colours (see Smith et al 2002). Similarly,\nthe existing conversion used in the CASU pipeline is not\nvalidated for (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) > 1.5. Clearly this will need to be\ncorrected in the future. In the mean time, the comparison\nbetween observations of M stars and synthesised data will\nbe increasingly qualitative as (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) increases beyond the\nvalidation limit.\nIn neither field 4095 nor field 4199 do supergiants stand\nout in any obvious morphological way. This is likely to\nbe both a consequence of their relative rarity and of the\nway in which their locus shifts almost along itself with increasing reddening. In principle, extremely red, isolated objects located below the red giant locus could be picked out\nas candidate reddened supergiants \u2013 or as potential examples of other interesting object types. Indeed, we find that\nIPHAS J184644.25+015324.6, the one isolated object in this\npart of the 4199 colour-colour plane at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 , r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) =\n(3.36 \u00b1 0.02, 0.499 \u00b1 0.03), cannot be a reddened supergiant.\nOne reason is that the reddening (E(B \u2212 V ) >\n\u223c 4) required\nto explain its position in these terms is excessive relative\nto the maximum expected for the field. Another is that\nthe 2MASS point source within 0.2 arcsec of this object's\nposition exhibits very bright JHK magnitudes with unusual colours (K = 9.55 \u00b1 0.02, (J \u2212 H) = 1.68 \u00b1 0.03,\n(H \u2212 K) = 0.76 \u00b1 0.03). At r \u2032 = 18.75 \u00b1 0.01, there\nare no grounds for doubting the reliability of the IPHAS\nphotometry and the reality of the source. The absence of\nany significant proper motion rules this object out as a\nnearby brown dwarf. This object is largely absent from preexisting photographic surveys, except that there is a detection of it in the UKST Infrared (IVN) Survey reported\non the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey website (http://wwwwfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/): it is reported there at an I magnitude\nof 18.383, around 3 magnitudes fainter than the IPHAS i\u2032\n\nA COMPARISON BETWEEN\nFLUX-CALIBRATED SPECTRA AND IPHAS\nPHOTOMETRY \u2013 A FIELD IN TAURUS\n\nUp to this point the interpretation of the (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\nplane has been based on synthetic photometry derived from\nP98 library spectra. Early in February 2004, we obtained\nWHT/ISIS service spectra of 6 stars selected from IPHAS\ndata on fields 2540 and 2540o in Taurus. These IPHAS images, obtained on 5th November 2003, were among the first\nto be pipeline-processed and were picked for closer investigation as examples of apparently good quality data obtained\nin good seeing and photometric conditions. The aim of the\nfollow-up service spectra was to obtain relative spectrophotometry in order to ascertain optical SEDs, spectral types\nand reddenings for the sample stars as a retrospective check\non the IPHAS colours, and the typical errors in them. This\nexercise gives an impression both of the current state of the\nphotometric calibration of the data and of the quality of the\nsynthetic colour comparisons derived from P98.\nField 2540 is centred on RA 05 33 49 Dec +25 15 00\n(2000) in Taurus, only a few degrees from the Galactic anticentre direction. The characteristics of this sky position\nare very different from those in Aquila: here, the maximum\nGalactic reddening is modest and more smoothly varying,\nranging from E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.8 in the NE of the \u223c 30 \u00d7 30\narcmin2 extracted region up to \u223c 1.1 in its SW. The other\nobvious difference, which stands out in the (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\nplot for 2540/2540o in Fig. 9, is the absence of any red giants within the magnitude range shown (13 < r \u2032 < 20). This\nabsence is not just a consequence of the imposed magnitude\nlimits since a K/M giant at 10 kpc viewed through \u223c3 visual\nmagnitudes of extinction should be detected at r \u2032 \u223c 17: it\nmust be a real absence. In the example of solar and lower\nmetallicity isochrones presented by Bertelli et al (1994), a\nred giant branch is only well-developed from around 100\nmillion years of age onwards \u2013 suggesting that the stellar\npopulations sampled in this part of the outer Galaxy are\nyounger than this.\n8 stars were initially selected for ISIS spectroscopy from\nthe colour-colour diagram for fields 2540/2540o on the basis that they were not too faint (r \u2032 < 18) and lay on the\nouter boundary of the main stellar locus (dark blue asterisks in Fig. 9). These criteria biased the selection in favour\nof evolved spectral types. In the event, 6 of the 8 stars\n(which we refer to as stars A\u2013F) were observed during a\nservice night of mediocre weather. Both the blue and red\narms of ISIS were used, with the R600B and R316R gratings installed, delivering spectra spanning 3500\u20135000 \u00c5 and\n6000\u20138700 \u00c5 for each star. To further the aim of relative\nspectrophotometry, the slit width was set fairly wide at 1.8\narcsec, while the slit orientation tracked the parallactic angle. The resolution of the spectra is \u223c 3.6 \u00c5. An observation\n\n\f14\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\nTable 5.

The magnitude range shown is 13 \u2264 r \u2032 \u2264 20. The dark blue asterisks mark\nthe colours of the 6 objects for which WHT/ISIS service spectra were obtained (stars A\u2013F, see also Fig. 10 and Table 5). The red\nasterisks mark the 'predicted' colours derived from the flux-calibrated spectra, after applying the same shift to all 6 objects in order\nto minimise the mean difference with respect to the original IPHAS colours. Like the computed colours for stars A\u2013F, the synthesised\nearly-A reddening line has been shifted by +0.03 and \u22120.14 in (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) and (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1), respectively.\n\nof the white dwarf G191\u2212B2B was also obtained to serve as\na spectrophotometric flux standard.\nThe data were extracted from the CCD frames and then\nwavelength- and flux-calibrated using routines from the software package, FIGARO. The extracted 1-D spectra were\nthen imported to the software tool, DIPSO, in order to determine approximate spectral types and reddenings by comparing them with P98 library spectra. In every case, the\nspectral type determination rested on matching absorption\nline characteristics. This matching was performed using the\nblue spectra for all but the M4V star (star D) \u2013 for this object the red spectrum was more appropriate. For each star,\nthe P98 library spectrum of the appropriate spectral type\nwas progressively reddened, using the mean Galactic extinction law (Howarth 1983), to identify the best fitting colour\nexcess. The observed spectra and the best fits to them derived in this manner are shown in Fig. 10. The positions,\nmagnitudes and further data on the 6 stars appear in Table 5. For star F, the data are not of sufficient quality to provide a reasonable fix on luminosity class: but we suspect that\nits H\u03b1 profile indicates a lower gravity than a main sequence\n\nA5 star. In order to: smooth errors due to irregularities in\nthe spectrophotometric flux calibration; avoid the need to\ncorrect for telluric absorption; provide a good extrapolation\nof the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to cover\nthe full spectral range, the final step of deriving photometric\ncolours used the closest matching, appropriately-reddened\nP98 library spectra in the r \u2032 and i\u2032 bands, rather than the\ncalibrated observations. Only the H\u03b1 fluxes were computed\nby multiplying the H\u03b1 filter profile directly with the calibrated ISIS spectra.\nBoth the original IPHAS colours and the colours derived\nfrom the fits to the spectrophotometry are listed in Table 5.\nAs there is not yet a uniform and fully-verified zero-point\ncalibration for all IPHAS frames, we have to shift the SEDbased colours on to the IPHAS colours. The shifts that minimise the mean differences in each of (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) and (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\nare \u22120.14 and +0.03, with final rms deviations between the\n6 pairs of observed and predicted colours of 0.015 and 0.026,\nrespectively. The size and sense of shift in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) is as\nexpected (see section 3). That the shift in (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) is small,\nbut apparently finite, indicates that the night the IPHAS\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\n15\n\nFigure 10. Fits of P98 library spectra (green) to flux-calibrated WHT/ISIS spectra (black) of selected stars in IPHAS field 2540/2540o\nin Taurus. The label in each box (letters A to F) refer to the positions marked in the colour-colour diagram for this field (Fig. 9). Next\nto each label is the spectral type and colour excess (E(B \u2212 V )) estimate for the star. In each plot, the flux scale is linear, with zero as\nthe minimum plotted value. The ISIS spectra are uncorrected for telluric absorption.\n\nimaging was obtained was not perfectly photometric. On\nthe basis of the errors estimated for the IPHAS photometry\n(see Fig. 2), we would expect the rms deviations between the\ncatalogued and observed colours to be \u223c0.01. The somewhat\nlarger values of 0.015 and 0.026 obtained here turn out to\nbe determined mainly by errors in the relative spectrophotometry and its analysis: for example, the uncertainty in the\nE(B \u2212 V ) estimates is typically 0.05 and translates into a\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) error of \u223c0.03. In (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1), the discrepancies are\nsmaller and mainly arise in the r \u2032 band integration. The circle from photometry to spectroscopy, back to photometry,\ncloses satisfactorily.\nAt the end of this process, it can be seen in Fig. 9 that\nstar A (A2V) falls a little below the early-A reddening line,\nrather than just above, while the reddening line itself lies\n\n\u223c 0.02 magnitudes above the bottom edge of the main stellar locus. A part of the reason for this may be illustrated\nin Fig. 11 where the P98 A2V spectrum is superimposed on\nthe ISIS observation of star A: it is possible that the limited\nresolution of the P98 library spectra (R \u2243 500 or \u2206\u03bb \u2243 13 \u00c5\nat H\u03b1) leads to the H\u03b1 in-band fluxes of early A-type stars\nbeing overestimated, very slightly. Another factor will be\nlinked to the question of the mean H\u03b1 absorption EW and\nits variance for early-A stars as a function of sub-type and\nmetallicity. The H\u03b1 absorption EW for star A is 14.5\u00b10.4 \u00c5,\nwhile that for the P98 A2V star is 10.8 \u00b1 0.5. These numbers for A2V may be compared with the P98 A0V and Hayes\n(1985) Vega H\u03b1 EWs, that are both close to 13.0 \u00c5. Finally\nwe note the contrast between the statement by Jaschek &\nJaschek (1987) that the Balmer lines are strongest at A2\n\n\f16\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\nFigure 12.

In the absence of its weak H\u03b1 emission, star B\nwould have fallen 0.13 lower in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1), at a position typical of\nnon-emission A0V stars.\n\nthe greater coherence of mean conditions (reddening, nature\nof population) within a smaller sky area leading to greater\nsuccess in identifying an 'unusual' object.\n\n6\n\nFigure 11. Excerpts of the spectra obtained for stars A and B,\nfocusing on the H\u03b1 line profiles. The WHT/ISIS observations are\nplotted in black, while the P98 library spectra of the appropriate\nspectral types (respectively A2V and A0V) are shown superimposed in blue. The excess emission equivalent width in star B is\n12 \u00c5. In both panels the positioning and FWHM of the IPHAS\nH\u03b1 filter is indicated by the horizontal bar.\n\n(see their Table 10.1) and the maximum in P98 for nearsolar metallicity dwarfs at A0. The underlying practical difficulty here is the measurement and calibration challenge of\nthe very broad H\u03b1 absorption wings in A-type spectra. As\nthe IPHAS survey completes and a uniform photometric calibration is constructed, it will then be appropriate to sort\nthe issue out and improve the absolute registration of this\nlower boundary. For the present, the A0V spectrum in the\nP98 library defines the shape of the early-A reddening line\nwell enough to allow it to be used in a relative manner.\nThe H\u03b1 profile for star B is also presented in Fig. 11.\nThis object shows a distinct central reversal in H\u03b1 which\nallows it to be described as a weak emission line object.\nThe excess (emission) equivalent width with respect to the\nlibrary A0V spectrum is 12 \u00c5. Indeed it was included in the\nlist of ISIS service targets because of the suspicion that this\nmight be the case: when it is plotted on the colour-colour\nplane with only neighbouring stars, within a 10\u00d710 arcmin2\nbox, it sits clearly separated in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) just above the\nlocal main stellar locus (see Fig. 12). This is an example of\n\nSPECTROSCOPIC TRAWLING FOR\nEMISSION-LINE AND OTHER RARE\nOBJECTS \u2013 FIELDS IN CEPHEUS\n\nWe now present some results from early spectroscopic followup of IPHAS in order to give a concrete example of the yields\nof different object types from IPHAS data. In this case, the\nchoice of sky area has been dictated mainly by observational\nconvenience, rather than by data quality considerations. The\nresults presented here rest on more typical IPHAS photometry.\n6.1\n\nThe MMT/HectoSpec observations\n\nIn June 2004 we obtained spectra with the Mount Hopkins\n6.5-metre MMT in F/5 configuration using the recently commissioned HectoSpec facility, a multi-object spectrograph\nfitted with 300 fibres that can be deployed across a field,\n1 degree in diameter (Fabricant et al 2004). The fibre positioner is mounted at Cassegrain. The 270 groove/mm grating used delivers broad wavelength coverage (4488 \u2013 8664 \u00c5)\nat 6.2 \u00c5 resolution. Over two nights, six different fields were\nobserved using two fibre configurations per pointing. The\ntarget stars selected for this programme fell mainly in the\nmagnitude range 17 \u2264 r \u2032 \u2264 20. The total on-source exposure\ntimes were 1200 secs. Spectra were extracted by the instrument pipeline that includes CCD bias and gain corrections,\nflat-fielding using domeflats as well as a sensitivity correction for the individual fibres using twilight flats. Individual\nfibre spectra were then extracted and wavelength calibrated\nusing FeNeAr-lamp exposures. Finally, a mean sky spectrum\nderived from the sky fibres was subtracted.

Data for objects in the magnitude ranges\n17 < r \u2032 < 20 and 20 < r \u2032 < 20.5 are shown in blue and black\nrespectively. Because of IPHAS field merging and the accompanying ad hoc photometric corrections, the main stellar locus is\nmore diffuse here than in individual field extractions (cf Fig. 13).\nThe simulated unreddened main sequence track and the early-A\nreddening line (drawn as solid lines) are accordingly less useful in\ndecoding the data.\n\nFigure 13. Point-source colour-colour data derived from IPHAS\nfields 7012/7012o in Cepheus. This plot illustrates the quality\nof data around (l = 105.6o , b = +4.0o ) from which we selected\ntargets for multi-fibre spectroscopy with MMT/HectoSpec. The\nmagnitude range from which HectoSpec targets were selected was\n(17 < r \u2032 < 20) (blue data points in both panels \u2013 data outside this\nmagnitude range are plotted as smaller black points). The black\nlines in both panels are the simulated unreddened main sequence\ntrack and early-A reddening line, shifted downward in (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1)\nby 0.16 magnitudes. Here they serve as fiducial lines to show how\nthe errors grow at fainter magnitudes.\n\nvariations in the sky background across the field of view, sky\nsubtraction using sky fibres is not always perfect and care\nmust be taken with spectra displaying weak, unresolved H\u03b1\nemission components. Sky subtraction will be improved in\nthe future using offset sky exposures that sample the sky for\neach fibre close to the target position, in conjunction with\nan optimal scaling correction using the strongest sky lines.\n6.2\n\nSelecting targets for the Cepheus field\n\nWe report the results from one of two pointings in\nthe constellation of Cepheus. Centred on RA 22 17\n00, Dec +61 33 37 (2000) (l = 105.6o , b = 4.0o ),\nthis position was picked because it contains a strip\nincluded in the Spitzer Galactic First Look Survey\n(http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/fls/galac/). Despite its rela-\n\ntively high Galactic latitude, this area of sky presents significant and locally-variable interstellar extinction (ranging\nfrom AV \u223c 4 up to \u223c7 magnitudes). This shows up in\nthe IPHAS colour data for the region as somewhat broadened main stellar loci. An example is shown as Fig. 13,\nwhere colour data extracted from the IPHAS field pair,\n7012/7012o, are plotted. At magnitudes brighter than r \u2032 \u223c\n19 (top panel), the colour uncertainties are less than \u223c0.05\nand are less significant than environmental factors in the\nsmearing of the main stellar locus \u2013 this reverses at fainter\nmagnitudes (lower panel) where the typical errors are \u223c 0.1.\nThe HectoSpec 1o -diameter field spans then IPHAS\nfield positions, not including offsets. The largest contributions, however, are from IPHAS fields 6985, 6993, 7012 and\n7019 (see Table 1). To speed up the compilation of the target\nlists, we chose to merge the data from all the relevant pointings first, before proceeding to target selection. In merging\nthe data, corrections for photometric shifts between different\nWFC exposures had to be applied. These were calculated using the mean magnitude offsets for sources located in field\noverlaps. Inevitably, this merging blurred the main stellar\nlocus in the colour plane some more \u2013 compare the lower\npanel in Fig. 13 with the plot for the full HectoSpec field in\nFig. 14. For the future, we are re-ordering the algorithm, in\norder to give more emphasis to selection at the individual\nfield level (cf the discussion of 'star B' at the end of Section\n5). Indeed a further tactic that can be applied in order to\nminimise the spread of the main stellar locus is to select\nfrom within a number of narrowly-set r \u2032 magnitude ranges.\nOn this occasion, after merging the catalogues for the relevant individual fields together, the main target selection was\nperformed within the full magnitude range to be observed,\n\n\f18\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\n17 \u2264 r \u2032 \u2264 20. Finally a few promising emission line star\ncandidates down to r \u2032 = 20.5 were added by hand.\nThe goal of this first round of HectoSpec observations\nwas to explore the complete IPHAS colour-colour plane\nwhile trying to give high priority to objects that are outliers\nor near the edge of the general distribution of objects. This\nnaturally includes all emission line star candidates, which\nlie above the main stellar locus.\nTo achieve this sampling, the following selection algorithm was applied. The colour-colour plane was split into\nbins of 0.1 magnitudes in width and height. Targets were\nthen selected based on the number of objects in each bin:\nfrom 1 to 3 objects in a bin, all were selected and given the\nhighest fibre allocation priority; between 4 to 9 objects in a\nbin, a random selection of 75% of the bin members was chosen with a slightly lower fibre allocation priority; between 10\nand 50 objects, a random fraction falling linearly from 50%\nto 10% was selected and given a low fibre selection priority\nbased on the number of objects in the bin; >50 objects in a\nbox, 10% of the objects were selected randomly and given a\nlow fibre selection priority based on the number of objects\nin the bin. The maximum number of objects that could be\nselected in a box was capped at 10. Finally, if a bin had 4\nneighbouring bins in the cardinal directions with 10 or more\nobjects, then only one object was selected for spectroscopy.\nThis rule was introduced to further reduce the number of\nobjects picked for spectroscopic follow up that lie in the\ndensest \u2013 and probably most uninteresting \u2013 parts of the\nstellar distribution.\nIf the selection algorithm gave less than the requested\nnumber of objects (\u223c 700 for 2 HectoSpec configurations)\nthen 1 object per bin was added, starting with the least\npopulated bins until the required number of objects was\nreached. If more than the requested number of objects was\nchosen, then 1 object was removed from each bin with more\nthan 1 object selected \u2013 starting with the most populated\nbin until the requested number of objects was reached. By\nthis means we were able to assign fibres to between 450 and\n540 targets, depending on the field observed. Each set was\nthen split into two configurations.\nThe outcome of this process and the HectoSpec observation of the Cepheus field was a collection of 496 stellar\nspectra.\n6.3\n\nResults of the MMT/HectoSpec spectroscopy\nin Cepheus\n\nFirst and foremost we find that essentially every target star\nlocated in the colour-colour plane clearly above the main\nstellar locus is confirmed as an emission line star. Altogether\n29 objects are confirmed as having H\u03b1 in emission, with 6\nor 7 lying on or just below the upper bound of the highly\npopulated region (green encircled points in Fig. 15). The\none object not encircled in green, at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) \u2243 1.1 and\n(r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) \u2243 1.5, is probably an emission line object also,\nbut remains ambiguous because it is very faint and its spectrum is correspondingly noisy. There is a still larger group,\nnumbering 47, of probable dMe stars. They are 'probable'\nbecause the sky subtraction may have left a false residue of\nH\u03b1 emission. The range of H\u03b1 emission equivalent widths\nin this group is from a few up to 10\u201320\u00c5. Quite plausibly,\nmost of these objects lie mixed in with non-emission dwarf\n\nM stars (of which there are 90 or more). The one 'probable\ndMe' stars (at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) \u2243 2.50, (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) \u2243 1.3) above the\nmain locus can be viewed as dMe with the greatest confidence because time-variable H\u03b1 emission is characteristic of\ndMe stars \u2013 presumably at the time of the IPHAS imaging,\nits H\u03b1 emission was brighter than 9 months later, at the\ntime of the spectroscopy.\nThe combination of moderate spectral resolution and\nshort exposure time has meant that many of the more routine objects, without H\u03b1 in emission or in marked absorption, are more challenging to sort into spectral classes. This\nlarge group of 214 objects will be dominated by late-A to\nmid K stars, but will also include some non-emission OB\nstars. The spectra of a further 89 stars are so faint and\nnoisy that no comment can be made about them. The standout objects towards the lower boundary of the main stellar\nlocus in Fig. 15 are the stars with H\u03b1 strongly in absorption. There are 15 of these. Two of them are well-separated\nfrom the main locus at much lower (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) and also much\nlower (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) \u2013 they are both white dwarfs. Similarly\nplaced objects in other IPHAS fields for which we have\nMMT/hectospec spectra have turned out to be white dwarfs\ntoo. The remaining thirteen stars with strong H\u03b1 absorption\nare early A stars. Tighter classification at this time is not\nfeasible.\nWe now present a selection of 8 objects and their spectra for more detailed discussion. These are identified in the\ncolour-colour plane shown as Fig. 15. The data on them,\ngiven in Table 6, includes estimates of their r \u2032 magnitudes\nand (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ), (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) colours derived from the highest\nquality IPHAS exposures currently available. Note that the\ncolours are, typically, different from those plotted in Figs. 15\n\u2013 this is due to the colour shifts applied in combining IPHAS\nfields before MMT/HectoSpec target selection. Since they\nassist in assigning broad object class, we also include in the\ntable 2MASS (J \u2212 H), (H \u2212 K) colours and K magnitudes.\nStars 1 \u2013 3 (Fig. 16) are most likely to be young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) of Herbig or T Tau type. This object class\nassignment is easiest for star 1 since the veiling is not so\nextreme as to hide the underlying M-star spectrum. Indeed,\na comparison between stars 1 and 4 in Fig. 16 suggests that\nthese objects' M spectral sub-types are likely to be very similar. The sky around star 1 has been imaged in all four IRAC\nbands by the Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey. We\ndownloaded the calibrated images from the Spitzer Science\nArchive and carried out point source extractions. Star 1 was\ndetected at 3.6, 4.5 and 5.8 \u03bcm, with fluxes corresponding\nto magnitudes of 12.47\u00b10.11, 12.12\u00b10.12 and 11.93\u00b10.14,\nrespectively. Using the observed IPHAS, 2MASS and IRAC\nfluxes, we find that the SED of Star 1 from the r\u2032 -band to\n5.8 \u03bcm happens to fit quite well to a 2000 K blackbody (although the SED must include components due to a reddened\nstellar photosphere, an accretion disk and warm dust).\nStar 2 has the highest contrast and richest emission line\nspectrum of the three stars \u2013 in this object, even the Na i\nD lines are thrown into emission and some forbidden line\nemission is present. Star 3 is intermediate between 1 and\n2, both in terms of the contrast of its emission spectrum,\nand that it is just possible to pick up late-type photospheric\nabsorption against the continuum (e.g. the blend at 6495 \u00c5\nstrong in G/early-K stars).

Drew et al.\n\nplace for Herbig or T Tau stars, with star 2 showing the\nmost marked excess.\nIt seems likely that these stars 1\u20133 are associated with\nLDN 1188 (l = 105.7, b = +4.2), a dark cloud less than 2o\naway from the well-known Sh 2-140 region of star formation.\nThis proximity suggests a similar distance to both regions,\nwhich has been given as 910 pc for Sh 2-140 by Crampton\n& Fisher (1974). However both these nebulae lie on the periphery of Cep OB2, to which the distance appears to be\nrather less (\u223c600 pc, de Zeeuw et al 1999). In a study of\nLDN 1188, Abraham et al (1995) reported the discovery of\na number of emission line stars in objective prism data obtained at Konkoly Observatory at brighter magnitudes than\nour HectoSpec selection. RNO 140 and RNO 141 (Cohen\n1980) are also in this neighbourhood.\nStar 4 can be presumed to be in the foreground with\nrespect to LDN 1188 and stars 1\u20133. Hence its JHK colours,\ncombined with its spectral type can be used to estimate\na minimum interstellar extinction towards LDN 1188. This\nworks out at E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 1.3 or AV \u2243 4 (for R = 3.1,\nand using data from Bessell & Brett 1988). We can now\nsee if this marries up with the implications of the IPHAS\ncolours of stars 1 \u2013 3 by comparing their catalogue values\nwith reddened synthetic estimates. This is accomplished via\nFig. 17 in which the IPHAS colours for stars 1 to 3 (Table 6)\nare compared with synthetic tracks (Table 4).\nIf star 2, with its generally high contrast emission line\nspectrum is a Herbig or T Tau star with an accretion dominated SED, its reddening would correspond to E(B\u2212V ) \u2243 2:\nfor, in Fig. 17, it lies just to the right of the track for\nF\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u22122.3 and E(B \u2212 V ) = 2. A similar, or somewhat\nlower, reddening would appear plausible for star 1 in that its\noptical SED should be somewhat redder, intrinsically, than\nthat of star 2. The intrinsic optical SED of star 3 should\nbe intermediate between stars 1 and 2 (given the marginal\ndetection of late-type photospheric absorption), and yet it\nis observed to be 'bluer' than either. The highest likely reddening of star 3 is E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 1.5: this reddening would\napply in the limiting case of an accretion-dominated SED,\nwhere the contribution of the G/K star is small.\nOn the basis of its (r \u2032 \u2212i\u2032 ) colour and spectral type, and\nafter correction for its H\u03b1 emission, star 4 would be assigned\nE(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 1. This is a somewhat lower estimate than the\nestimate based on 2MASS NIR colours (E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 1.3)\nbut not so large a discrepancy that either the NIR or optical\nphotometrically calibration must be called into question. In\nconclusion, we find that the order of increasing reddening\nappears to be: star 4 in the foreground, star 3, and then\nstar 1 and star 2, spanning the range 1 <\n\u223c E(B \u2212 V ) <\n\u223c 2.\nThe Schlegel et al (1998) Galactic reddening maps indicate\nmaximal reddenings of E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 2.5 for this part of the\nPlane. We have rough consistency and a first indication of\npatchy reddening toward the young objects in the vicinity\nof LDN 1188 . If half the r \u2032 flux of star 1 is attributed to\nan \u223cM3 stellar photosphere, and AV \u223c 6, one may deduce\na stellar radius of around 4 times the M3V main sequence\nradius, for a distance of \u223c 600 pc.\nThe IPHAS colours for stars 2 and 3, picked out in\nFig. 17, are broadly consistent with their observed H\u03b1 EWs\n(200 \u00c5 and 80 \u00c5), in that their colours 'predict' EWs of\n\u223c200 \u00c5 and \u223c100 \u00c5, respectively. Only star 1 is discrepant\nin that its observed EW (\u223c190 \u00c5) is distinctly low com-\n\nFigure 16.

Given that H\u03b1 EW\nis well known to be a time-variable quantity in most classes\nof emission line object, consistency for 2 out of 3 objects is\nacceptable.\nThe spectra of 4 non emission line objects, star 5\u20138,\nare shown in Fig. 18. These draw attention to what can be\ncalled H\u03b1 deficit positions in the IPHAS colour-colour plane\n(cf Fig. 15). At the blue end, objects 5 and 6 are examples\nof extreme and strong H\u03b1 absorption objects: respectively a\nwhite dwarf and an early A star. At the red end, objects 7\nand 8 are respectively a normal, somewhat reddened mid-M\ngiant, while object 8 has the distinctive CN band structure of\na carbon star in its spectrum. Object 7 is typical of the stars\npopulating the red end of the giant strip in the IPHAS plane.\nThe NIR colours and rough spectral type (\u223cM4III) suggest\na reddening corresponding to E(B \u2212 V ) of about 2. Carbon\nstars like object 8 will usually fall below the red giant strip\n(lacking the TiO bands that, in M-type spectra, lead to the\nseeming flux maximum in the H\u03b1 region). In terms of its NIR\ncolours, star 8 is a more extreme object than the suspected\ncarbon star mentioned at the end of section 5 (although\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\n21\n\nFigure 17. A diagnostic colour-colour diagram for the Cepheus\nregion stars 1 to 3 in Table 6. The blue, light blue, (right hand)\ngreen and red tracks, from Table 4 and Fig. 6, are reddened to\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 2. They respectively represent the colour-colour response to increasingly strong (narrow) H\u03b1 line emission of extreme O stars, \u223cA0 stars, optically-thick accretion disks and \u223cG2\nstars. For contrast, the track for optically thick disk accretion at\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 1 (left hand green line) is also shown. The horizontal dashed lines are lines of constant H\u03b1 equivalent width.\nThe numbers 1\u20133 mark the positions of stars 1\u20133: note that their\n(r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) colours have been incremented by 0.16 (cf Fig. 13) to\nplace them in the simulation colour domain. The required correction in (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) will be significantly smaller.\n\nreddening gives both objects more extreme (J \u2212 H, H \u2212 K)\ncolours than seen in the local Galactic carbon star sample\nof Claussen et al, 1987). Indeed Object 8 appears to be a\nreddened (AV \u223c 5) version of 2MASSI J0326599+143957,\ndescribed by Liebert et al (2000) as a luminous, very cool,\nlate N type carbon star.\nIn summary, our early MMT/Hectospec observations\nof this field in Cepheus sample a diverse range of objects.\nSources lying clearly above the stellar locus in the (r \u2032 \u2212\nH\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) colour-colour plane have indeed been confirmed\nas true emission line objects with H\u03b1 EWs ranging from\na few to 200 \u00c5. Many of them are likely to be Herbig or\nT Tau stars. In addition several H\u03b1 deficit sources have been\nidentified. Multi-object spectroscopic follow-up will remain\na key part of our efforts to mine the IPHAS database.\n\n7\n\nIPHAS OPPORTUNITIES FOR H\u03b1 IMAGING\n\nThe power of the survey for detecting stellar H\u03b1 emission\nhas already been described. A second target for the survey\nare the spatially-resolved emission-line nebulae. These nebulae are \u2013 like emission-line stars \u2013 associated with early\nand late phases of stellar evolution, and indicate ionization\nof circumstellar gas, in the form of H ii regions, planetary\nnebulae and supernova remnants. Already, in the southern\nhemisphere, the UKST SHS has shown the remarkable incompleteness of existing catalogues by doubling the number\nof known planetary nebulae (Parker et al 2003).\nThe Galactic Plane shows ubiquitous diffuse H\u03b1 emission as well as reflection nebulae, which need to be distinguished from circumstellar ionized nebulae. Since reflection\n\nFigure 18. The MMT/HectoSpec counts spectra of Cepheus targets 5 to 8, as marked in Fig. 15 and listed in Table 6.\n\nnebulae are the product of continuum scattering, they can\nbe removed by comparison of H\u03b1 and r \u2032 images. Diffuse\nH\u03b1 emission occurs on large size scales (10 arcminutes to\ndegrees) and lacks the usual symmetry of circumstellar nebulae.\nImaging of extended nebulae requires well behaved\nbackground on the CCDs making up the WFC. Because of\nthis, the preferred image properties for nebular studies are\nvery different from those for point source extraction: high\nbackground is acceptable for the latter, while poor seeing is\nacceptable for the former. Small nebulae covered well within\na single CCD do not require special reduction. Each object\nwill usually have been covered in at least two pointings by\nthe time the survey is complete, giving improved S/N. For\nlarger objects, mosaics need to be made. Subtracting an r \u2032\nframe removes stars: for small areas this can be done using\nPSF matching techniques, but this is very computationally\nintensive \u2013 such that for larger fields, a direct subtraction is\nused which typically leaves larger residuals.\nThe limitations of the technique are largely due to background variations. The observations are generally taken in\ngrey and bright time. Different fields will therefore present\nwith very different background sky levels. The sky subtracts\n\n\f22\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\nFigure 19. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1 image mosaic of the extremely large angular size supernova remnant, S 147. The frame size\nis roughly 5 degrees across, and 4 degrees down. The extent of the SNR is given by Van den Bergh et al (1973) as 200 x 180 arcmin2 . N\nis up and E to the left. The H ii region, Sh 2-242 is picked out near the eastern edge of the image by the white box (see Fig. 20).\n\nfairly well in an H\u03b1 \u2212 r \u2032 image (unless the background is\nvariable under non-photometric conditions), but if there is\nsmooth extended H\u03b1 emission over large angular scales, its\ncontribution is currently not separately determined from the\nsky contribution. Internal reflections are seen in some images, from bright stars. In some locations, a bright star just\noutside the field of view gives a flare-like feature on the edge\nof a nearby frame.\nA photometric calibration is determined for point\nsources, but not for extended emission. To correctly calibrate\nemission nebulae, assuming the continuum background is\nfully subtracted, the filter response curve needs to be precisely known and needs to be stable over the likely Doppler\nwavelength shifts (Ruffle et al 2004). [N ii] will also intrude\ninto the flux. Currently, calibration is best performed using\nknown planetary nebulae located in the imaged area. Note\nthat stellar H\u03b1 sources cannot be used for calibration as\ntheir line flux tends to be time variable.\n\n7.1\n\nA supernova remnant\n\nAs an example of the possiblities regarding extended\nnebulae, we present an image of the supernova remnant S 147 (Shajn 147, or Simeis 147, in full \u2013 not\n\nSh 2-147, with which it is confused in SIMBAD). This\nis a near-perfect remnant of an approximately spherical shape, showing a typical filamentary structure. It is\npositioned just overlapping the anti-galactic centre, its\nown centre being at l \u2243 180.1o , b \u2243 \u22121.6o . But due\nto its large extent, spanning several degrees, only photographic images have been published so far (Van den\nBergh, Marscher & Terzian, 1973). See also the 24th March\n2005 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' due to R. Gendler\n(http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050324.html).\nAn IPHAS image of S 147 was produced by combining\napproximately 250 pointings. The pipeline mosaicing procedure was found to be inadequate for combining many fields\ntaken under widely varying conditions. We therefore used\nthe pipeline only to produce reduced images of the individual CCDs for each pointing. Then, for each image, we\nsubtracted the r \u2032 image from the H\u03b1 data and smoothed to\na pixel size of 5 arcsec (a binning factor of 15). The background per image was approximately nulled by subtraction\nof the median: in fields with bright and extended emission\nthis required manual selection of areas for background definition \u2013 otherwise the median over all four CCDs of one\npointing was used. One corner of CCD no. 3 is affected by\nscattered light in conditions of bright Moon light (amplified\nif cirrus was present): this corner was always blanked out.\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\n\n23\n\nvery large scale structure of S 147, we show as Fig. 20, a full\nresolution image of this H ii region.\n\n8\n\nFigure 20. The Hii region, Sh 2-242, picked out on the eastern\nedge of Fig. 19, shown at full resolution. This is a false colour\ncomposite of the images in the three filters. The imaged area is\nroughly 10 x 10 arcmin2 . N is up and E to the left.\n\nAll CCDs tend to show a gradient along the long axis of\nabout 1 ADU in the subtracted image: this could be due to\na charge-transfer efficiency limitation, but its exact cause is\nnot known. It does not subtract automatically because the\nr \u2032 image is scaled first \u2013 accordingly, as a final step, this\nremaining gradient was subtracted from all images.\nThe resulting images were combined in a single mosaic\nusing the Virtual Observatory software package Montage.\nThis involved regridding each frame, and determining background corrections by comparing areas in common between\ndifferent images. We finally produced an image covering 25\nsquare degrees. We note that extended emission on scales\nof a degree or more may not be well represented, as it can\nbe affected by the background subtraction procedure. However, the filamentary structures are very well recovered. The\nbackground fitting was found to be insufficiently constrained\nat the outer edges of the imaged area, leaving some negative areas. To deal with this, a linear gradient was fitted\nto the background in empty regions of the full field, and\nsubtracted.\nThe image of S 147 is shown as Fig. 19. A bigger version is to be found in the ING Newletter article describing\nIPHAS (Drew et al 2005). The improvement is very marked\nin comparison with the photographic image shown by Van\nden Bergh et al (1973): the huge increase in dynamic range\nbrings with it a subtlety of detail missing from the old imagery. Furthermore, these data allow smaller areas to be\nimaged to much higher resolution. But even at this 5 arcsec\nrebinning the structure is clear. We note that a blow-out is\nobvious on two sides of the remnant: left and right (to the\nE and W). The full extent of S 147 is essentially as reported\nby Van den Bergh et al, at a mean diameter of just over 3o\n\u2013 several times that of the Moon.\nAt the eastern edge of the image mosaic, and south\nof centre, lies another prominent but much more compact\nnebulosity, Sh 2-242. This very bright smudge in Fig. 19 has\na mean H\u03b1 diameter of 8.0 arcmin. As a contrast to the\n\nSUMMARISING DISCUSSION\n\nThe main aim of this paper has been to introduce IPHAS,\nthe INT Photometric H\u03b1 Survey of the Northern Galactic\nPlane. By the beginning of 2005, 55% of the imaging observations had been obtained. It is expected that the survey\nwill reach completion in 2006.\nGiven that previous surveying of the northern Galactic\nPlane for emission line objects rarely reached deeper than\nV \u223c 13 (see KW99), while the sensitivity limit of IPHAS\nis r \u2032 \u223c 20, there is no doubt that a huge domain is being\nopened up for exploration for the first time. It is difficult\nto predict the numbers of emission line objects that will be\ndiscovered, even now with the survey in progress, because\nthe distribution of such objects along the Galactic Plane is\nextremely uneven (see KW99). The small number of IPHAS\nfields discussed in this paper fit in with this impression:\nno emission line objects were evident in the colour-colour\nplane for the Taurus field (2540/2540o in section 5 \u2013 but\na very modest example was found on closer examination);\na handful were evident in the Aquila fields (section 4), and\nupwards of 20, all fainter than r \u2032 = 17, were picked up in\nthe MMT/HectoSpec pointing toward LDN 1188 in Cepheus\n(section 6). Crudely averaging the experience to date, it is\nlikely IPHAS will uncover around 10 emission line objects\nper square degree in the range 13 < r \u2032 < 20 (roughly 2 to 3\nper IPHAS field), and hence no less than \u223c20,000 altogether.\nThrough its use of both narrow-band H\u03b1 and broadband r \u2032 and i\u2032 CCD photometry, IPHAS has the capability\nto pick out H\u03b1 deficit objects \u2013 a possibility typically beyond objective prism spectroscopy, the traditional tool of\nemission line star hunting. For example, unreddened white\ndwarfs are easily spotted as blue objects with small or negative (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1), separated from the main stellar locus in\nthe IPHAS (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) plane. It is a reasonable guess\nthat over a thousand will be discovered in IPHAS data, just\nas have been discovered in a comparable sky area around\nthe north Galactic cap via the Sloan survey (Kleinman et\nal 2004). Very red H\u03b1 deficit objects can be either brown\ndwarfs or carbon stars \u2013 classes of star that both lack the\nTiO band absorption responsible for raising (r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1) in normal M stars \u2013 or they can be very reddened, rare examples\nof late-type supergiants. Two carbon stars (one probable,\nthe other confirmed) have been reported here.\nA further role for IPHAS is that it can help trace the\nway in which the stellar populations making up the Galactic\nPlane vary across the northern sky. It has been shown here\nthat not all sightlines look the same in IPHAS colours: of\nparticular note is the sharp contrast between the red-giant\ndeficient Taurus field (l = 181.7o , section 5), in the Galactic\nAnticentre region, versus the Aquila fields (l \u2243 33o ) with\ntheir prominent giant-star populations, sampling the inner\nGalaxy. Before now, rather little has been known about the\nfar reaches of the Milky Way outside the Solar Circle. For\nexample, the recent study of Galactic spiral structure by\nRusseil (2003) reaches only to \u223c 6 kpc, outward from the\nSun. The sensitivity of IPHAS is more than adequate for extending our knowledge much further: even relatively humble\n\n\f24\n\nJanet E. Drew et al.\n\nA0\u2013A3 V stars \u2013 easily picked out around what has been\ndubbed the early-A reddening line in the IPHAS colourcolour plane \u2013 are potentially accessible out to distances of\n\u223c20 kpc in the direction of the lightly reddened Galactic\nAnticentre.\nWe have laid out the character of the (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1, r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 )\ncolour-colour plane that is unique to this survey, and have\nestablished a grid of simulated colours that will be of use\nin the analysis of IPHAS observations. In doing this, we\nhave inevitably identified items of work for the future. For\nexample, a job remains to be done to achieve as good a\nquantitative match between simulations and observations of\nM stars as is achieved for earlier spectral types. A related\nproblem has been noted by those developing Sloan Digital\nSky Survey photometric calibrations (Smith et al 2002). The\nreward for solving this problem will be the chance to fully\nrealise the potential of IPHAS as an unparalleled resource\nfor the statistical analysis of M-dwarf activity. Another task\nis to gather a a range of early A star spectra that can be\nused to achieve better definition of the early-A reddening\nline and its dependences. As specified here, it is unlikely to\nbe more than \u223c0.02 magnitudes from its correct registration\nin (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1).\nBigger issues to be dealt with are that the photometric calibration of IPHAS data will need to be made uniform\nacross the survey, and that a proper definition of H\u03b1 magnitude zero point (referred to Vega) is needed that can be\napplied within the pipeline processing. Until these calibration requirements have been met, it will remain necessary to\nderive colour offsets between observed and simulated data\nindependently for every IPHAS field. Typically, offsets in\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) will be small \u2013 but for (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1), the differences between catalogue and simulated colours may vary from \u223c0.1\nup to \u223c0.2 magnitudes. In most cases it is easy to gauge\nthe required offset by matching the synthesised unreddened\nmain sequence track and early-A reddening line to the upper and lower boundaries of the main stellar locus in the\ncolour-colour plane.\nSimulations have also been performed that show how\nthe equivalent width threshold for the detection of H\u03b1 emission will change with observed (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) colour (section 3.2\nand Fig. 6). The photometric accuracy of IPHAS is such\nthat (r \u2032 \u2212 H\u03b1) differences of 0.05\u20130.1 are significant down\nto r \u2032 \u223c 20. Re-expressed in terms of an H\u03b1 equivalent width,\nand for magnitudes brighter than \u223c19, this corresponds to\na threshold emission EW of roughly 5 \u00c5.\nIt has been shown that the typical morphology of the\nmain stellar locus in the colour-colour plane permits the\nselection of candidate emission line stars presenting with\nthreshold H\u03b1 emission at low (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) only. In practise the\nIPHAS bright magnitude limit (r \u2032 \u223c 13) has the effect of\nall but eliminating normal stars with colours bluer than\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) \u223c 0.5 from the point source catalogue (note Figs. 3,\n9 and 14) \u2013 with the consequence that lightly-reddened subluminous accreting objects, with or without H\u03b1 emission,\nwill usually lie comfortably outside the main stellar locus.\nIPHAS can therefore be used straightforwardly to identify\nall such objects (in addition to many non-interacting white\ndwarfs, found as 'deficit' objects).\nThe threshold for H\u03b1 emission high-confidence detection rises from \u223c 10 \u00c5 equivalent width at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) \u223c 1 up\nto \u223c 50 \u00c5 at (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) \u223c 2.5 \u2013 beyond this the colour-colour\n\nplane typically becomes sparsely populated again. This has\nimportant implications for the detectability of T Tau and\nother young emission line objects: based on equivalent width\ndata collected by Reipurth, Pedrosa & Lago (1996, their Table 1 and Fig. 10), one-third to a half of such objects would\nbe immediately identifiable as emission line objects in the\nIPHAS database at E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 3. At lower reddenings\nthe fraction would be higher. This suggests that the roles\nfor IPHAS with respect to young stellar populations are (i)\nfinding extreme examples anywhere (here we have presented\ntwo with H\u03b1 emission EWs of \u223c 200 \u00c5), and (ii) picking\nout new associations through the detection of its most active members. Once a new association is identified, a more\ndetailed exploration of catalogued IPHAS sources, exploiting the tricks of e.g. apparent magnitude binning, or small\narea searches, would be likely to uncover further candidate\nemission line sources.\nEvolved high mass stars, with H\u03b1 emission, that find\ntheir way into the IPHAS database will do so because they\nare very distant and significantly reddened (they are otherwise too bright). The more extreme, least well-understood,\nand therefore more interesting groups (Wolf-Rayet stars, luminous blue variables, B[e] stars, yellow hypergiants) usually\npresent with very high EW H\u03b1 emission (\u223c 100 \u00c5 and more)\nand so will not be missed. The most extreme point-source\nemission line objects of all, compact nebulae, are most likely\nto appear to be relatively blue in (r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) or even evade detection in the i\u2032 band, and will have the most extreme values\nof (r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1) possible, i.e. not more than 3 to 3.1, in practice.\nThis connects naturally to a topic only touched on in\nthis paper \u2013 the exploitation of IPHAS in the study of\nspatially-resolved nebulae (deferred to a later paper). A\nsearch for PNe is in progress, in which several tens of candidates have been identified and a few have been studied\nspectroscopically. A paper on the study of an intriguing\nquadrupolar nebula located well-outside the Solar Circle is\nin preparation (Mampaso et al). Here we have simply drawn\nattention to the flexibility IPHAS presents for the investigation of a wide range of spatial scales, ranging from arcseconds to several degrees.\nFurther power to diagnose either particular object types\nor complete stellar populations will come from pooling\nIPHAS r \u2032 , H\u03b1 and i\u2032 data with data from surveys in different wavebands. In the future of an astronomy conducted via\nvirtual observatories, a survey as comprehensive as IPHAS\n\u2013 with its particular exploitation of narrowband H\u03b1 data \u2013\nwill be a major resource. Currently there is an obvious synergy with the all-sky NIR survey 2MASS, although this is\nlimited to the reddened parts of the northern Galactic Plane\nsince 2MASS reaches only to K \u223c 15. The gap this leaves\nshould soon be plugged by the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey, reaching to K = 19 (see http://www.ukidss.org/). Beyond IPHAS, comprehensive optical surveying of the northern Galaxy using linear detectors is still lacking. However it\nis interesting to note the recent release by SDSS of u'g'r'i'z'\ndata on a number of low Galactic latitude fields (Finkbeiner\net al 2004).\nWe finish with a comment on the plans for making\nIPHAS data available to the community. At the present\ntime there is open access to the reduced images held at\nCASU, from a year after the images have been processed.\nAccordingly the images obtained in 2003 can already be\n\n\fH\u03b1 survey of the northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS)\naccessed by anyone able to reach the CASU web interface (http://apm2.ast.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wfs/dqc.cgi). Access immediately after processing is available to those working in the ING partner countries: the United Kingdom;\nSpain and The Netherlands. The point source catalogues\nare to be released in two stages: in the first half of 2006 we\naim to release as many as are available, calibrated only at\nthe individual exposure level (as they have been described\nhere); we intend to follow this up with a second release, after\nthe survey is complete, and when a uniform calibration has\nbeen established across all fields. We anticipate that the final catalogue will contain photometry on around 80 million\npoint sources, capturing data on roughly 1 for every 1000\nstars estimated as existing in the northern Milky Way.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis paper makes use of data from both the Isaac Newton\nand William Herschel Telescopes, operated on the island of\nLa Palma by the Isaac Newton Group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de\nAstrofisica de Canarias.
