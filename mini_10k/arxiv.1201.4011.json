Sigismondi 1\nAbstract. The role of Venus and Mercury transits is crucial to know\nthe past history of the solar diameter. Through the W parameter,\nthe logarithmic derivative of the radius with respect to the luminosity,\nthe past values of the solar luminosity can be recovered. The black\ndrop phenomenon affects the evaluation of the instants of internal and\nexternal contacts between the planetary disk and the solar limb. With\nthese observed instants compared with the ephemerides the value of\nthe solar diameter is recovered. The black drop and seeing effects are\novercome with two fitting circles, to Venus and to the Sun, drawn in\nthe undistorted part of the image. The corrections of ephemerides due\nto the atmospheric refraction will also be taken into account. The\nforthcoming transit of Venus will allow an accuracy on the diameter\nof the Sun better than 0.01 arcsec, with good images of the ingress\nand of the egress taken each second. Chinese solar observatories are\nin the optimal conditions to obtain valuable data for the measurement\nof the solar diameter with the Venus transit of 5/6 June 2012 with\nan unprecedented accuracy, and with absolute calibration given by the\nephemerides.\n\n1\n\nThe method of eclipses\n\nI. I. Shapiro in 1980[1] used records of transits of Mercury to recover the past\nhistory of the solar diameter.[2] Further studies seems to confirm the constancy of\nthe diameter within the errorbars. Measurements made with different instruments,\nunder perfect observing conditions, as in the case of Gambart and Bessel in 1832\nyield different transit times, and different diameter of Mercury and, consequently,\na different diameter of the Sun.[3, 4]\nThe determination of the planetary diameter is subjected to the Point Spread\nFunction of the telescope matching with the Limb Darkening Function of the\nSun,[5] and, in the case of Venus, there is also the atmosphere.\n1 Sapienza University of Rome and ICRA, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, IRSOL and\nGPA-Observatorio Nacional Rio de Janeiro. e-mail: sigismondi@icra.it\n\nc EDP Sciences 2018\nDOI: (will be inserted later)\n\n\f2\n\nUnderstanding Solar Activity: Advances and Challenges\n\nFig. 1. Two stages of the egress of Venus in 2004 (H\u03b1 images of Anthony Ayomamitis,\nAthens, details). The circular profiles of Venus and Sun are fitted to the undistorted part\nof the image.\n\nNowadys the chord draft on the solar limb by the planet's disk can be recovered\nby photos, in conditions not affected by black drop phenomenon.[6, 7] The time\nin which the chord is zero, when the black drop is maximum, can be extrapolated\nfrom UTC labelled photographs made each second around the intermediate stages\nof ingress and egress. After corrections for Earth's atmospheric refraction the\nephemerides can be used to recover the solar diameter by comparison with the\nobserved ingress and egress times. The opportunity given by the forthcoming\ntransit of Venus of 5/6 june 2012 and the one of Mercury of May 9, 2016 has\nto be exploited to measure the solar diameter with unprecedented accuracy. The\nstudies on the Venus aureole[8] if done with UTC synchronized high-resolution\nphotos, can be useful to do solar diameter measurements, once the location of the\nobservations are known with GPS coordinates.\n\n2\n\nConclusions: one image per second during 2012 ingress/egress\n\nWe study the position of the center of the planet with respect to the inflexion point\nof the limb darkening function of the Sun (the solar lim). By using the circular\nfits to the undistorted part of the image we avoid the black drop effect. We can\nuse two reference instants of comparison with ephemerides:\n\u2022 the time when the center of Venus crosses the solar limb.\n\u2022 the time when the chord drawn by Venus and the solar limb becomes zero.[7]\nThe first method can be applied also to the external aureole[8] produced by the\nrefraction in the upper atmosphere of Venus, and this method is independent on\nthe thickness of the atmosphere, because it uses the center of the planet. Similarly\nthe determination of the center of the planet is less affected by the black drop\nphenomenon with respect to the second method of the length of the chord.\n\n\fSolar diameter with 2012 Venus transit\n\n3\n\nThe method of the chord has been tested with 50 images made each minute,\n25 at ingress and 25 at egress, in the H\u03b1 line by A. Ayomamitis with a 16 cm\napochromatic refractor near Athens during the Venus transit of 2004: the accuracy\nwithout refraction correction has been 2.6 s at the egress and 8.1 s at the ingress\n(with the Sun low near the horizon); the final accuracy on the whole solar radius\nwas 0.38 arcsec.\nAn improvement on the final\u221aaccuracy is expected with a 1 s photo sampling\n(60 times larger; accuracy 0.38/ 60 \u223c 0.05 arcsec), and a further improvement\nwill come from the atmospheric refraction corrections and from the determination\nof the center of the planet, instead of the chord's length. The ultimate level of\naccuracy below 0.01 arcsec is the goal of this measurement: the most precise\nachievable with ground based methods. China is under optimal conditions to\nobserved the transit of Venus of 2012, and to gather useful images to accurately\nmeasure the actual solar diameter.\nAcknowledgments Thanks to Anthony Ayomamitis for the images of the\nVenus transit of 2004.
