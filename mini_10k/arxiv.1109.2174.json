The domination number \u03b3(G) is the size of\na minimum dominating set in G. Vizing's conjecture from 1968 states that for the\nCartesian product of graphs G and H, \u03b3(G)\u03b3(H) \u2264 \u03b3(G\u0003H), and Clark and Suen\n(2000) proved that \u03b3(G)\u03b3(H) \u2264 2\u03b3(G\u0003H). In this paper, we modify the approach\nof Clark and Suen to prove a variety of similar bounds related to total and paired\ndomination, and also extend these bounds to the n-Cartesian product of graphs A1\nthrough An .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe consider simple undirected graphs G = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E. The\nopen neighborhood of a vertex v \u2208 V (G) is denoted by NG (v), and closed neighborhood\nby NG [v]. A dominating set D of a graph G is a subset of V (G) such that for all v,\nNG [v] \u2229 D 6= \u2205. A \u03b3-set of G is a minimum dominating set for G, and its size is denoted\n\u03b3(G). A total dominating set D of a graph G is a subset of V (G) such that for all v,\nNG (v) \u2229 D 6= \u2205. A \u03b3t -set of G is a minimum total dominating set for G, and its size is\ndenoted \u03b3t (G). A paired dominating set D for a graph G is a dominating set such that\nthe subgraph of G induced by D (denoted G[D]) has a perfect matching. A \u03b3pr -set of G\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n1\n\n\fis a minimum paired dominating set for G, and its size is denoted \u03b3pr (G). In general, for\na graph containing no isolated vertices, \u03b3(G) \u2264 \u03b3t (G) \u2264 \u03b3pr (G).\nThe Cartesian product graph, denoted G\u0003H, is the graph with vertex set V (G) \u00d7\nV (H), where vertices gh and g \u2032 h\u2032 are adjacent whenever g = g \u2032 and (h, h\u2032 ) \u2208 E(H), or\nh = h\u2032 and (g, g \u2032) \u2208 E(G). Just as the Cartesian product of graphs G and H is denoted\nG\u0003H, the n-product of graphs A1 , A2 , . . . , An is denoted as A1 \u0003A2 \u0003 * * * \u0003An , and has\nvertex set V (A1 ) \u00d7 V (A2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 V (An ), where vertices u1 * * * un and v 1 * * * v n are adjacent\nif and only if for some i, (ui , v i ) \u2208 E(Ai ), and uj = v j for all other indices j 6= i.\nVizing's conjecture from 1968 states that \u03b3(G)\u03b3(H) \u2264 \u03b3(G\u0003H). For a thorough\nreview of the activity on this famous open problem, see [1] and references therein. In\n2000, Clark and Suen [2] proved that \u03b3(G)\u03b3(H) \u2264 2\u03b3(G\u0003H) by a sophisticated doublecounting argument which involved projecting a \u03b3-set of the product graph G\u0003H down\nonto the graph H. In this paper, we slightly modify the Clark and Suen double-counting\napproach and instead project subsets of G\u0003H down onto both graphs G and H, which\nallow us to prove five theorems relating to total and paired domination. In this section,\nwe state the results, and in Section 2, we prove the results.\nTheorem 1. Given graphs G and H containing no isolated vertices,\n\b\nmax \u03b3(G)\u03b3t (H), \u03b3t(G)\u03b3(H) \u2264 2\u03b3(G\u0003H) .\n\nIn 2008, Ho [3] proved an inequality for total domination analogous to the Clark and\nSuen inequality for domination. In particular, Ho proved \u03b3t (G)\u03b3t (H) \u2264 2\u03b3t (G\u0003H). We\nprovide a slightly different proof of Ho's inequality, and then extend the result to the\nn-product case.\nTheorem 2 (Ho [3]). Given graphs G and H containing no isolated vertices,\n\u03b3t (G)\u03b3t (H) \u2264 2\u03b3t (G\u0003H) .\nTheorem 3. Given graphs A1 , A2 , . . . , An containing no isolated vertices,\nn\nY\n\n\u03b3t (Ai ) \u2264 n\u03b3t (A1 \u0003A2 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ) .\n\ni=1\n\nIn 2010, Hou and Jiang [4] proved that \u03b3pr (G)\u03b3pr (H) \u2264 7\u03b3pr (G\u0003H), for graphs G and\nH containing no isolated vertices. We provide an improvement to this result, and extend\nthe result to the n-product graph.\nTheorem 4. Given graphs G and H containing no isolated vertices,\n\u03b3pr (G)\u03b3pr (H) \u2264 6\u03b3pr (G\u0003H) .\nTheorem 5. Given graphs A1 , . . . , An containing no isolated vertices,\nn\nY\n\n\u03b3pr (Ai ) \u2264 2n\u22121 (2n \u2212 1)\u03b3pr (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ) .\n\ni=1\n\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMain Results\n\nWe begin by introducing some notation which will be utilized throughout the proofs in\nthis section. Given S \u2286 V (G\u0003H), the projection of S onto graphs G and H is defined as\n\u03a6G (S) = {g \u2208 V (G) | \u2203 h \u2208 V (H) with gh \u2208 S} ,\n\u03a6H (S) = {h \u2208 V (H) | \u2203 g \u2208 V (G) with gh \u2208 S} .\nIn the case of the n-product graph A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An , we project a set of vertices in V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An )\ndown to a particular graph Ai . Therefore, given S \u2286 V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ), we define\n\u03a6Ai (S) = {a \u2208 V (Ai ) | \u2203 u1 * * * un \u2208 S with a = ui } .\nFor gh \u2208 V (G\u0003H), the G-neighborhood and H-neighborhood of gh are defined as follows:\nNG\u0003H (gh) = {g \u2032h \u2208 V (G\u0003H) | g \u2032 \u2208 NG (g)} ,\nNG\u0003H (gh) = {gh\u2032 \u2208 V (G\u0003H) | h\u2032 \u2208 NH (h)} .\nThus, NG\u0003H (gh) and NG\u0003H (gh) are both subsets of V (G\u0003H). Additionally, E(G\u0003H)\ncan be partitioned into two sets, G-edges and H-edges, where\nG-edges = {(gh, g \u2032h) \u2208 E(G\u0003H) | h \u2208 V (H) and (g, g \u2032) \u2208 E(G)} ,\nH-edges = {(gh, gh\u2032) \u2208 E(G\u0003H) | g \u2208 V (G) and (h, h\u2032 ) \u2208 E(H)} .\nIn the case of the n-product graph A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An , we identify the i-neighborhood of a\nparticular vertex, and partition the set of edges E(A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ) into n sets. Thus, we\ndefine Ei to be\nn\no\n\u0001\nEi = u1 * * * un , v 1 * * * v n | (ui , v i ) \u2208 E(Ai ), and uj = vj , for all other indices j 6= i ,\nand for a vertex u \u2208 V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ), we define\nn\no\nN\u0003Ai (u) = v \u2208 V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ) | v and u are connected by Ei -edge .\n\nFinally, we need two elementary propositions about matrices that will be utilized throughout the proofs.\nProposition 1. Let M be a binary matrix. Then either\n(a) each column contains a 1, or\n(b) each row contains a 0 .\n\nProp. 1 refers only to d1 \u00d7 d2 binary matrices. Prop. 2 is a generalization of Prop. 1\nfor d1 \u00d7 d2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn n-ary matrices.\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n3\n\n\fProposition 2. Let M be a d1 \u00d7d2 \u00d7* * *\u00d7dn , n-ary matrix (n-ary in this case signifies that\nM contains entries only in the range {1, . . . , n}). Then there exists a j \u2208 {1, . . . , n} (not\nnecessarily unique), such that each of the d1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dj\u22121 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 dj+1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn submatrices\nof M contains an entry with value j. Such a matrix M is called a j-matrix.\nNote that, given any d1 \u00d7 d2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn matrix, there are dj submatrices of the form\nd1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dj\u22121 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 dj+1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn . We will denote such a submatrix as M[:, ij , :] with\n1 \u2264 ij \u2264 dj .\nProof. Let M be a d1 \u00d7d2 \u00d7* * *\u00d7dn n-ary matrix which is not a j-matrix for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u22121.\nWe will show that M is an n-matrix.\nConsider j = 1. Since M is not a 1-matrix, there exists at least one 1\u00d7d2 \u00d7d3 \u00d7* * *\u00d7dn\nsubmatrix that does not contain a 1. Without loss of generality, let M[i1 , :] with 1 \u2264 i1 \u2264\nd1 be such a matrix. Next, consider j = 2. Since M is also not a 2-matrix, let M[:, i2 , :]\nwith 1 \u2264 i2 \u2264 d2 be a d1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 d3 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn submatrix that does not contain a 2.\nTherefore, M[i1 , i2 , :] is a 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 d3 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn submatrix that contains neither a 1 nor a 2.\nWe continue this pattern for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1. Since M is not a j-matrix for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1,\nlet M[i1 , . . . , in\u22121 , :] be the 1 \u00d7 * * * 1 \u00d7 dn submatrix containing no elements in the set\n{1, * * * , n \u2212 1}. Therefore, for all 1 \u2264 x \u2264 dn , M[i1 , . . . , in\u22121 , x] = n, and all of the\nd1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 dn\u22121 \u00d7 1 submatrices of M contains an entry with value n. Thus, M is an\nn-matrix.\nNow, we present the proofs of Theorems 1 through 5.\n\n2.1\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nProof. Let {u1, . . . , u\u03b3t (G) } be a \u03b3t -set of G. Partition V (G) into sets D1 , . . . , D\u03b3t (G) ,\nsuch that Di \u2286 NG (ui ). Let {u1 , . . . , u\u03b3(H) } be a \u03b3-set of H. Partition V (H) into sets\nD 1 , . . . , D\u03b3(H) , such that uj \u2208 D j and D j \u2286 NH [uj ]. We note that {D1 , . . . , D\u03b3t (G) } \u00d7\n{D 1 , . . . , D\u03b3(H) } is a partition of V (G\u0003H). Let D be a \u03b3-set of G\u0003H. Then, for each\ngh \u2208\n/ D, either NG\u0003H (gh) \u2229 D or NG\u0003H (gh) \u2229 D is non-empty. Based on this observation,\nwe define the binary |V (G)| \u00d7 |V (H)| matrix F such that:\n(\n1 if gh \u2208 D or NG\u0003H (gh) \u2229 D 6= \u2205 ,\nF (g, h) =\n0 otherwise .\nSince F is a |V (G)| \u00d7 |V (H)| matrix, each of the Di \u00d7 D j subsets of V (G\u0003H) determines\na submatrix of F .\nFor i = 1, . . . , \u03b3t (G), let Zi = D \u2229 (Di \u00d7 V (H)), and let\n\b\nSi = D x | the submatrix of F determined by Di \u00d7 D x satisfies Prop. 1a,\nwith x \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b3(H)} .\n\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n4\n\n\fFor j = 1, . . . , \u03b3(H), let Z j = D \u2229 (V (G) \u00d7 Dj ), and let\n\b\nS j = Dx | the submatrix of F determined by Dx \u00d7 D j satisfies Prop. 1b,\nwith x \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b3t (G)} .\n\nP t (G)\nP\nLet dH = \u03b3i=1\n|Si |, and dG = \u03b3(H)\nj=1 |S j |.

If the submatrix of F determined by Di \u00d7 D j satisfies Prop. 1a, then D j is\ndominated by \u03a6H (Zi ).\nProof. Let h \u2208 Dj . We must show that either h \u2208 \u03a6H (Zi ), or h is adjacent to a vertex\nh\u2032 in \u03a6H (Zi ). If (Di \u00d7 {h}) \u2229 D 6= \u2205, there exists a g \u2208 Di such that gh \u2208 D. Thus,\nh \u2208 \u03a6H (Zi ).\nIf (Di \u00d7 {h}) \u2229 D = \u2205, then recall that the submatrix of F determined by Di \u00d7 Dj\nsatisfies Prop. 1a. Therefore, there is a 1 in every column of the submatrix. This implies\nthere exists a g \u2208 Di such that F (g, h) = 1. Since gh \u2208\n/ D, there exists an h\u2032 \u2208 V (H) such\nthat gh\u2032 \u2208 NG\u0003H (gh) \u2229 D. Therefore, (gh\u2032, gh) is an H-edge, implying (h, h\u2032 ) \u2208 E(H) and\nh is adjacent to h\u2032 . Therefore, D j is dominated by \u03a6H (Zi ).\nClaim 2. If the submatrix of F determined by Di \u00d7 D j satisfies Prop. 1b, then Di is\ndominated by \u03a6G (Z j ). Additionally, \u2200g \u2208 Di \u2229 \u03a6G (Z j ), there exists a vertex g \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6G (Z j )\nsuch that (g, g \u2032) \u2208 E(G).\nWe note that this claim does not imply that \u03a6G (Z j ) is a total dominating set, but the\nclaim is a slightly stronger condition on domination. When applying this condition, we\nwill say that the set Di is non-self dominated by \u03a6G (Z j ).\nProof. The argument for proving that \u03a6G (Z j ) dominates Di is almost identical to the\nproof of Claim 1. The only difference is that the Di \u00d7D j submatrix of F satisfies Prop. 1b.\nThus, every row contains a 0. But since every vertex in V (G\u0003H) is dominated by D,\nthis implies that every vertex g \u2208 Di is dominated by some other (not itself) vertex\ng \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6G (Z j ). Thus, Di is dominated by \u03a6G (Z j ), with the\n\u0001 slightly stronger condition that\nevery vertex in Di even those vertices in Di \u2229 \u03a6G (Z j ) is adjacent to another vertex in\n\u03a6G (Z j ).\nClaim 3. For i = 1, . . . , \u03b3t (G), |Si | \u2264 |Zi |. Similarly, for j = 1, . . . , \u03b3(H), |S j | \u2264 |Z j |.\nProof. Let Si = {Dj1 , Dj2 , . . . , D jk }, and let\n\b A = \u03a6H (Zi ). Note that |A| \u2264 |Zi |. By Claim\nk\n1, A dominates \u222ax=1 D jx . Therefore,\nA \u222a uj | j \u2208\n/ {j1 , j2 , . . . , jk } is a dominating set of\n\b\nH, and, since the sets A and uj | j \u2208\n/ {j1 , j2 , . . . , jk } are disjoint, then\n\b\nA \u222a uj | j \u2208\n/ {j1 , j2 , . . . , jk } = |A|+(\u03b3(H) \u2212 k) \u2265 \u03b3(H) .\nHence, k = |Si | \u2264 |A| \u2264 |Zi |.\n\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n5\n\n\fFor the proof of second part, let S j = {Di1 , Di2 , . . . , Dik }, and let A = \u03a6G (Z j ). Again,\nnote that |A| \u2264 |Z j |. Then by Claim 2, A dominates \u222akx=1 Dix , with the stronger condition\nthat \u2200g \u2208 D\bix \u2229 A, there exists a vertex g \u2032 \u2208 A such that (g, g \u2032) \u2208 E(G). \bNow we\nconsider A \u2229 ui | i \u2208\n/ {i1 , i2 , . . . , ik } . If this intersection is non-empty, let A \u2229 ui | i \u2208\n/\nl\n{i1 , i2 , . . . , ik } = {uik+1 , . . . , uil }. Then,\nA dominates \u222ax=1 Dix with the same stronger\n\b\ncondition. Moreover, the\n/ {i1 , i2 , . . . , ik , . . . , il } are disjoint.\n\b sets A and ui | i \u2208\nWe claim that A \u222a ui | i \u2208\n/ {i1 , . . . , il } is a total dominating set of G. To see this,\nconsider any vertex g \u2208 V (G). If g \u2208 Dx with x \u2208 {i1 , i2 , . . . , ik }, then by the stronger\ncondition on domination associated with Claim\n\b 2, g is adjacent to another vertex in A.\nIf g \u2208 Dx with x \u2208\n/ {i1 , . . . , ik }, then ux \u2208 ui | i \u2208\n/ {i1 , . . . , ik } , and g is adjacent to\nux , since ux dominates Dx . We note that\n\b\n\b ux is either in A (if k + 1 \u2264 x \u2264 l) or in\nui | i \u2208\n/ {i1 , . . . , il } .

Moreover, we can similarly prove that\n\u03b3(G)\u03b3t (H) \u2264 2\u03b3(G\u0003H). Therefore, max{\u03b3(G)\u03b3t (H), \u03b3t(G)\u03b3(H)} \u2264 2\u03b3(G\u0003H).\n\n2.2\n\nProof of Theorem 2\n\nProof. Let {u1 , . . . , u\u03b3t (G) } be a \u03b3t -set of G.

Then, E = A \u222a B \u222a C is a dominating set of H with M as\na matching. Let M1 = V (M) and M2 = (B \u222a C)\\M1 . We note that M1 consists of all\nthe vertices in C plus the matched vertices from B, and M2 contains only the unmatched\nvertices from B. Therefore, |M1 | + 2|M2 | \u2264 |C| + |ZHi |. To see this more clearly, consider\na vertex gh \u2208 ZHi that is matched by an H-edge to a vertex gh\u2032 such that h \u2208\n/ V (M).\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThis implies that either h coincides with a vertex of C, or h coincides with the projection\nof some other vertex of ZHi (because otherwise h would be matched with h\u2032 ). Therefore,\n2|M2 | is equivalent to counting h\u2032 , and we see that |M1 | + 2|M2 | \u2264 |C| + |ZHi |.\nIn order to obtain a perfect matching of E, we recursively modify E by choosing an unmatched vertex h in E (a vertex in either A or B, since all vertices in C are automatically\nmatched), and then either matching it with an appropriate vertex, or removing it from\nE. Specifically, if NH (h)\\V (M) is non-empty, there exists a vertex h\u2032 \u2208 NH (h)\\V (M)\nsuch that we can add h\u2032 to E and (h, h\u2032 ) to the matching M.

For i = 1, . . . , n, let ki = \u03b3pr (Ai )/2, and let {xi1 , y1i , . . . , xiki , yki i } be a \u03b3pr -set of Ai ,\nand D1i , . . . , Dki i be the corresponding partitions (as defined in Theorem 4).\nLet Q = {D11 , . . . , Dk11 }\u00d7* * *\u00d7{D1n , . . . , Dknn }. Then Q forms a partition of V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An )\nn\nn\nY\n1 Y\ni\nwith |Q| =\n\u03b3pr (A )/2 = n\n\u03b3pr (Ai ).\n2\ni=1\ni=1\nLet D be a \u03b3pr -set of A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An . Then, for each u \u2208 V (A1 \u0003 * * * \u0003An ), there exists an\ni such that N\u0003Ai (u)\u2229D is non-empty. We now proceed slightly differently than previously.\nBased on this observation (as in the 2-dimensional case), we define n different matrices\nF i with i = 1, . . . , n, where each of the n matrices is an n-ary |V (A1 )| \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 |V (An )|\nmatrix F i such that:\n(\ni\nif u1 * * * un \u2208 D ,\nF i (u1 , . . . , un ) =\njmin where jmin = min{ j | N\u0003Aj (u1 * * * un ) \u2229 D 6= \u2205} .\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n10\n\n\fThus, each of the n matrices F i with i = 1, . . . , n differs only in the entries that correspond\nto vertices in the paired dominating set D.\nFor j = 1, . . . , n and i = 1, . . . , n, let dij \u2286 Q be the set of the elements in Q which\nare j-matrices in the matrix F i . By Prop. 2, each element of Q belongs to at least one\ndij -set for each i = 1, . . . , n. Now, if an element q \u2208 Q belongs to the dij -set, then q also\nbelongs to the djj -set. To see this, if Mi and Mj are the submatrices determined by q with\nrespect to the matrices F i and F j , respectively, then all the entries that do not match in\nMi and Mj have value j in Mj . Thus, each q \u2208 Q belongs to at least one dii -set for some\nn\nn\nX\n1 Y\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Then, n\n\u03b3pr (Ai ) \u2264\n|dii |.\n2 i=1\ni=1\nSimilar to Q, let B = {D11 , . . . , Dk11 } \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 {D1n\u22121, . . . , Dkn\u22121\n}. For convenience, we\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nY\n1 Y\n\u03b3pr (Ai ).\ndenote B as {B1 , . . . , B|B| }, where |B| =\n\u03b3pr (Ai )/2 = n\u22121\n2\ni=1\ni=1\n1\nn\nSince D is a \u03b3pr -set, the subgraph of A \u0003 * * * \u0003A induced by D has a perfect matching.\nLet\nDi = {u \u2208 D | the matching edge incident to u is in Ei } .\nThen, D can be written as the disjoint union of the subsets Di . For p = 1, . . . , |B| and\ni = 1, . . . , n, let Zpi = Di \u2229 (Bp \u00d7 An ), and\n\b\nSp = Dxn | the submatrix of F n determined by Bp \u00d7 Dxn is an n-matrix,\nwith x \u2208 {1, . . . , kn } .\n\nClaim 6. For p = 1, . . . , |B|, 2|Sp | \u2264 2|Zp1 |+ * * * + 2|Zpn\u22121|+|Zpn |.\nProof. Let Sp = {Djn1 , Djn2 , . . . , Djnt }, and for j = 1, . . . , n, let Vj = \u03a6An (Zpj ). Note that\n\b\n\b\n|Vj | \u2264 |Zpj |. Similiar to the proof of Claim 5, let C = xnj | j \u2208\n/ {j1 , j2 , . . . , jt } \u222a yjn | j \u2208\n/\n{j1 , j2 , . . . , jt } .\nLet M be the matching on Vn \u222aC formed by taking all of the {xnj , yjn } edges induced by\nthe vertices in C, and then adding the edges from a maximal matching on the remaining\nunmatched vertices in Vn . Then, E = V1 \u222a * * * \u222a Vn \u222a C is a dominating set of An with M\nas a matching.\nLet M1 = V (M) and M2 = (Vn \u222a C)\\M1 . We note that M1 consists of all the vertices\nin C plus the matched vertices from Vn , and M2 contains only the unmatched vertices\nfrom Vn .\nIn order to obtain a perfect matching, we recursively modify E by choosing an unmatched vertex a in E, and then either matching it with an appropriate vertex, or removing it from E. Specifically, if NAn (a)\\V (M) is non-empty, there exists a vertex\na\u2032 \u2208 NAn (a)\\V (M) such that we can add a\u2032 to E and (a, a\u2032 ) to the matching M. Otherwise, a is incident on only matched vertices, and we can safely remove it from E without\naltering the fact that E is a dominating set.\n\nthe electronic journal of combinatorics 16 (2009), #R00\n\n11\n\n\fOur recursively modified E (denoted by Erec ) is now a paired dominating set of An .\nFurthermore, in the worst case, we have doubled the unmatched vertices from Vn , and\nalso doubled the vertices in V1 , . . . , Vn\u22121 . Thus,\n2kn \u2264 |Erec | \u2264 2|V1 |+ * * * + 2|Vn\u22121 |+|M1 |+2|M2 | .\nThis implies that 2kn \u2212|C| \u2264 2|V1 |+ * * *+2|Vn\u22121|+|Zpn |. Since 2kn \u2212|C| = 2|Sp |, therefore,\n2|Sp | \u2264 2|V1|+ * * * + 2|Vn\u22121|+|Zpn | \u2264 2|Zp1 |+ * * * + 2|Zpn\u22121 |+|Zpn | .\nTo conclude the proof, we follow a similar method as in the proof of Theorem 4. We\nbegin by noting that,\n|dnn |\n\n=\n\n|B|\nX\n\n|Sp | .\n\np=1\n\nUsing Claim 6, we now see\n2\n\n|B|\nX\np=1\n\n|B|\n|B| \u0010\nn\n\u0011\nX\nX\nX\nj\nn\n|Zpn | = 2|D| \u2212 |Dn | .\n|Zp | \u2212 |Zp | = 2|D| \u2212\n2\n|Sp | \u2264\np=1\n\np=1\n\nj=1\n\nTherefore, 2|dnn | \u2264 2|D| \u2212 |Dn |. Similarly, we can show that 2|dii | \u2264 2|D| \u2212 |Di | for\ni = 1, . . . , n.
