As a model, we consider an infinite cylinder with vanishing charge but\nnon-zero surface current density. In general relativity, there is no solution involving\nonly a homogenous magnetic field. The only static solution of Einstein-Maxwell\nequations representing a magnetic field that is cylindrically symmetric and regular\non the symmetry axis is the Bonnor-Melvin universe [1] the invariant of which\ndecreases with increasing distance from the axis. This is a natural consequence of\nthe fact that the energy of the magnetic field curves the spacetime. However, a weak\nfield changes only slowly near the axis thus representing a good approximation of\nthe classical situation.\nTherefore, we take the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime and join it to the Levi-Civita\nspacetime, i.e., to the most general static, cylindrically symmetric solution of vacuum Einstein equations. This is achieved in such a way that junction conditions are\nsatisfied on the hypersurface that separates the two spacetimes and represents a\nthin cylindrical shell of matter. To determine the surface energy-momentum tensor\nand the electric current on the shell, we apply Israel formalism [2] generalized by\nKucha\u0159 [3] to Einstein-Maxwell fields. There is one free parameter in the interior\nBonnor-Melvin solution and two free parameters in the exterior Levi-Civita solution. We show that for any circumference of the cylinder we can always choose these\nthree parameters in such a way that the the density and pressure of the matter on\nthe shell satisfy energy conditions. Moreover, the energy-momentum tensor can be\ninterpreted as that of counter-rotating, charged particles held in equilibrium by the\nLorentz force and gravity.\nWith a weak magnetic field inside, low unit-length mass of the shell, and a small\nradius of the shell, the resulting field corresponds very well to the Newtonian case\n\u2217)\n\nDedicated to Prof. Ji\u0159\u0131\u0301 Hor\u00e1\u010dek on the occasion of his 60th birthday.\n\nCzechoslovak Journal of Physics, Vol. 51 (2001), No. 0\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\fM. \u017dofka and J.

However, we must bear in mind that the invariant of\nthe field is not constant in our case-this is to be expected since the electromagnetic\nfield adds to the gravitational mass and a homogeneous field is thus not possible.\nThe usual form of the metric [1]\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b2 2 (\u2212c2 d\u03c4 2 + d\u03b6 2 + d\u03c1\u03032 ) + \u03c1\u03032 /\u03b2 2 d\u03c62 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 + GK 2 \u03c1\u03032 /c4 is obtained from (1)\u221a\nby the transformation \u03c1\u03032 /\u03b2 2 = \u03b1\u03c12 .\n2\nThe singular surface located at \u03c1 = c /K G at infinite proper distance from\nthe axis cannot be reached in finite time even by photons and all timelike geodesics\nhave their turning points closer to the axis.\nThe circumference of rings \u03c4, \u03b6, \u03c1 = constant reaches its maximum value of\n\u221a\nCmax = \u03c0c2 /K G\n(7)\n\u221a\nfor \u03c1 = c2 /K 2G or \u03b1 = 1/2 and then decreases to zero again (see Figure 1).\nThe spacetime metric outside the shell is the Levi-Civita universe\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c12m c2 d\u03c4 2 + \u03c12m(m\u22121) (d\u03b6 2 + d\u03c12 ) + \u03c12(1\u2212m) /C 2 d\u03c62 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere C is the conicity parameter of the metric, m is the Levi-Civita parameter\nrelated to the strength of the gravitational field, and \u03c1 \u2265 R.\n2\n\nA\n\nCzech.

In this case it is possible to completely specify the outer spacetime and still find\ndifferent inner solutions (however, the corresponding induced energy-momentum\ntensors will be different). Therefore, a given Levi-Civita spacetime can be thought\nof as admitting diverse possible sources. (This is due to the fact that the junction\nconditions on the shell surface do not require the continuity of the first derivatives\nof the characteristic forms of the spacetime.) We should also note that if we want\nto reach the maximum possible circumference of the shell (\u03b1 = 1/2) we must admit\nm \u2265 1 entering thus the region where the Levi-Civita spacetime does not have a\nclassical counterpart.\nIt is interesting that if we insist that there be Minkowski spacetime inside the\ncylinder [7] then the particle (or photon) interpretation only allows m \u2208 [0; 1].\nBy admitting magnetic fields inside the cylinder, we extended the particle-interpretation range for the sources of the Levi-Civita spacetime.

Interpretation ranges for counter-rotating and counter-spiraling particles: \u03b1 corresponds to the inner radius of the cylinders and m is the outer Levi-Civita parameter.\nCounter-spiraling particles admit solutions between the two full curves while counterrotating particles only between the upper full curve and the dotted curve. In these areas\nwe can always find such a combination of the 5 spacetime parameters that the resulting shell can be made of particles.

The azimuthal velocity of the streams is\ns\nG\n.\n(24)\nv\u03a6 =\n\u03b52 /c2 + 1/M1\nExpressing \u03b5 as a function of the remaining parameters we obtain\nq\n2 \u2212 1/M .\n\u03b5 = c G/v\u03a6\n1\n\n(25)\n\n2\nIf we have a cylinder of radius r made of charged fluid of pressure p (p = \u03c1v\u03a6\ndue\nto the streaming of the particles composing the fluid) that induces magnetic field\nH inside, we find\n1\n1\nGM12 = 2\u03c0rp + r2 H 2 \u2261 P + r2 H 2 ,\n(26)\n4\n4\nwhere P = 2\u03c0rp = Cp is pressure integrated around the cylinder.\nWe can now compare the classical cylinders to the weak-field limit of the relativistic results. We base our interpretation on one of the junction conditions due to\nKucha\u0159 [3], namely\n1\n(27)\nK\u0303AB S AB = F\u0303A\u22a5 J A ,\nc\n+\n\u2212\nwhere K\u0303AB = (KAB\n+ KAB\n)/2 is the mean extrinsic curvature of the surface,\n+\n\u2212\nSAB is the induced energy-momentum tensor, F\u0303A\u22a5 = (FA\u22a5\n+ FA\u22a5\n)/2 is the mean\nMaxwell tensor, JA is the induced current, and upper-case Latin indices take on\nvalues T, Z, \u03a6. In fact, (27) is not an additional constraint on the solution-it\nis automatically satisfied here since both spacetimes obey the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations. We now interpret ST T as the energy density, \u03c1c2 , of the induced matter\nand S\u03a6\u03a6 as its pressure, p.
