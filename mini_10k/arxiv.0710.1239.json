Email: g.l.sewell@qmul.ac.uk\n\nAbstract\nWe present a general, model-independent, quantum statistical treatment of the connection between the quantum and hydrodynamic pictures of reservoir driven macroscopic\nsystems. This treatment is centred on the large scale properties of locally conserved hydrodynamical observables and is designed to provide a bridge between quantum microdynamics and classical macroscopic continuum mechanics, rather than a derivation of the latter\nfrom the former. The key assumptions on which the treatment is based are hypotheses of\nchaoticity and local equilibrium for the hydrodynamical fluctuations around nonequilibrium steady states, together with an extension of Onsager's regression hypothesis to these\nstates. On this basis, we establish canonical generalisations of both the Onsager reciprocity\nrelations and the Onsager-Machlup fluctuation theory to nonequilibrium steady states, and\nwe show that the spatial correlations of the hydrodynamical fluctuations are generically of\nlong range in these states.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is an empirical fact that the laws of classical macroscopic continuum mechanics are\nextremely general and independent, in form, of microscopic constitution. This suggests\nthat it should be possible to base a statistical mechanical treatment of these laws on very\ngeneral arguments that are centred on macroscopic observables of the hydrodynamical\ntype. In fact, such a treatment was initiated by Onsager [1], in his ground-breaking work\nof nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which served to relate the macroscopic dynamics of\nsystems close to equilibrium to certain extremely general properties of their underlying\nmicroscopic dynamics. This kind of approach to the connection between nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics and microphysics has been subsequently pursued by the present author\nin works [2-4] designed to form a bridge between quantum microdynamics and macroscopic\nquantum continuum mechanics rather than a derivation of the latter from the former*: its\nscope, moreover, is not restricted to states close to global equilibrium.\nThe present article is devoted to an expositary account of our quantum macrostatisti* It is thus radically different from the derivations of Euler, though not Navier-Stokes,\nhydrodynamics of models of a plama [5] and of a fermionic system with short range intercations [6] from their underlying quantum dynamics\n1\n\n\fcal picture of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of reservoir driven macroscopic systems\n[3, 4]. This is based on general assumptions of (a) local equilibrium at a certain mesoscopic\nlevel, (b) chaoticity of the currents associated with the locally conserved quantum fields\nand (c) an extension of Onsager's regression hypothesis to fluctuations about nonequilibrium states. On the basis of these hypotheses, which have been substantiated for certain\ntractable models [7], we have obtained both a nonlinear generalisation of Onsager's theory and the result that the spatial correlations of hydrodynamical observables of reservoir\ndriven open systems are generically of long range in nonequilibrium steady states. This\nlatter result, which had previously been obtained for some special classical stochastic models [8-10], marks a crucial difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, since\nthe spatial correlations carried by the former are of short range, except at critical points.\nIn Section 2, we present our model of macroscopic quantum systems in general terms,\nfrom both the microscopic and the hydrodynamical standpoints. In Section 3, we formulate\nthe fluctuation process executed by the hydrodynamical variables, subject to the above assumptions (a)-(c), and from these we derive canonical generalisations of both the Onsager\nreciprocity relations and the Onsager-Machlup [11] fluctuation dynamics to nonequilibrium steady states. In Section 4 we show that, under the above assumptions, the spatial\ncorrelations of hydrodynamical observables in nonequilibrium steady states are generically\nof long range. We conclude in Sec. 5 with further brief comments on the theory presented\nhere.\n2. The Model\nWe take the model to be a quantum system, \u03a3, of N particles located in a bounded\nopen connected region \u03a9N of a d-dimensional space, X, and coupled at its boundary, \u2202\u03a9N ,\nto an array of reservoirs R = {R\u03b1 }. \u03a3 is thus an open system, comprising part of the\ncomposite \u03a3c := (\u03a3 + R), which we assume to be conservative. The particle number N is\na variable parameter of the model. We assume that \u03a9N is the dilation by a factor LN of\na fixed region \u03a9 of unit volume and that both \u03a9 and the mean particle number density, \u03bd,\nof \u03a3 are N -independent. Thus \u03a9N = {LN x|x\u2208\u03a9} and \u03bdLdN = N . Throughout this article\nwe employ units in which h\u0304 and kBoltzmann are equal to unity.\n2.1. The Quantum Statistical Picture.\nWe employ the standard operator algebraic description [12-14, 2] of conservative system such as \u03a3c or \u03a3, in the situation where it is isolated from R. Thus, we recall\nthat, in this description, the observables of such a system are the self-adjoint elements\nof a \u22c6 -algebra, A, its states, \u03c9, are linear, positive, normalised, expectation functionals\nA\u2192h\u03c9 : Ai on A, and its dynamics, in the Heisenberg picture, corresponds to a oneparameter group of automorphisms A\u2192At of A.We assume that all its interactions are\ninvariant under space translations, rotations and time reversals. The equilibrium states\nof the system at inverse temperature \u03b2 are characterised by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger\n(KMS) condition [15, 2]:h\u03c9 : At Bi = h\u03c9; BAt+i\u03b2 i, \u2200 A, B\u2208A.\n2\n\n\fThe set of states satisfying this condition is convex, and its extremal elements correspond\nto pure thermodynamic phases [16, 2].\nWe assume that \u03a3 has a set of extensive, conserved observables Q\u0302 = (Q\u03021 , . ., Q\u0302n ), which\nintercommute up to surface corrections and are thermodynamically complete in the sense\nthat the equilibrium states corresponding to pure phases are labelled by the expectation\nvalues of the global density of Q\u0302 in the limit N \u2192\u221e [2]. We denote by s(q) the equilibrium\nentropy density for which this expectation value is q = (q1 , . ., qn ). The function s is\nconcave and may be formulated by standard statistical mechanical procedures [12, 2].\nThe thermodynamical control variable conjugate to q is then \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , . ., \u03b8n ), with \u03b8r =\n\u2202s(q)/\u2202qr . Thus, assuming that Q\u03021 is the energy observable, \u03b81 is the inverse temperature.\nWe restrict our considerations to situations where the system is confined to a single phase\nregion for which q lies in a connected domain, \u2206, of Rn , in which the function s is smooth\nand the correspondence between q and \u03b8 is one-to-one. It follows that the Hessian matrix\ns\u2032\u2032 (q) := [\u2202 2 s/\u2202qk \u2202ql ] is invertible and we define\nJ(q) := \u2212s\u2032\u2032 (q)\u22121 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nFurther, by the one-to-one correspondence between q and \u03b8, the equilibrium states is this\nphase may equivalently be labelled by the latter or the former. We assume the symmetries of time inversions, space translations and space rotations are unbroken in this pure\nequilibrium phase.\nThe Reservoirs. We assume that each reservoir R\u03b1 has a thermodynamically complete\nset, Q\u0302, of extensive conserved observables Q\u0302\u03b1 = (Q\u0302\u03b1,1 , . ., Q\u0302\u03b1,n), which are the natural\ncounterparts of the Q\u0302r 's and which satisfy the condition that the \u03a3 \u2212 R\u03b1 interactions\nconserve each (Q\u0302r + Q\u0302\u03b1,r ). The thermodynamical control variable, \u03b8\u03b1 , of R\u03b1 is then the\ncanonical counterpart of the variable \u03b8 of \u03a3. We denote by \u03c9\u03b1 (\u03b8\u03b1 ) the equilibrium state\nof R\u03b1 corresponding to \u03b8\u03b1 .\nThe Steady State of \u03a3c . We assume that the system \u03a3 and the reservoirs {R\u03b1 } are\nindependently prepared, in the remote past, with \u03a3 in an arbitrary state \u03c6 and each R\u03b1 in\nits equilibrium state \u03c9\u03b1 (\u03b8\u03b1 ), and that the reservoirs are then coupled to spatially disjoint\nregions of \u2202\u03a9N , whose union comprises that surface. Then, under rather general conditions\n[17, 18], \u03a3c evolves to a terminal state \u03c9 c , which evidently depends on the variables {\u03b8\u03b1 }\nIn the special case where the \u03b8\u03b1 's for the different reservoirs are all equal, \u03c9 c is a canonical\nequilibrium state. Otherwise, it is the nonequilibrium steady state of \u03a3c for the specified\nconditions.\nThe Local Density of Q\u0302. We assume that the extensive conserved observables\nQ\u0302\n\u0001\nof \u03a3 have locally conserved, position dependent densities q\u0302(x) = q\u03021 (x), . ., q\u0302k (x) with\n\u0001\nassociated currents \u0135(x) = \u01351 (x), . ., \u0135n (x) . More precisely, we assume that the local\nconservation law for q\u0302 prevails for the evolution of this field not only for the dynamics of\n\u03a3, when isolated, but also for that of the composite system \u03a3c = (\u03a3 + R). Thus, denoting\nby q\u0302t (x)\u2261q\u0302(x, t) and \u0135t (x)\u2261\u0135(x, t) the evolutes of the fields q\u0302 and \u0135, respectively, for the\n3\n\n\fsystem \u03a3c , these time- dependent fields and currents satisfy the local conservation law\n\u2202 q\u0302t\n+ \u2207.\u0135t = 0.\n\u2202t\nFor simplicity, we assume that both the extensive observable Q\u0302 and its position dependent\ndensity q\u0302 are invariant under time reversals, i.e. velocity reversals.\nIn accordance with the general requirements of quantum field theory [19], we assume\nthat the fields q\u0302t and \u0135t are operator valued distributions*.\n2.2. The Hydrodynamical Description.\nWe assume that the hydrodynamical picture is given by a continuum mechanical\nlaw governing the\u0001evolution of an n-component, locally conserved classical field qt (x) =\nq1,t (x), . ., qn,t (x) , on a macroscopic space-time scale that we shall presently specify. As\nwe shall see in Section 2.3, this field represents a rescaled expectation value of the quantum\nfield q\u0302t (x), but here we shall be concerned with just its phenomenological properties.\nWe assume that the current jt = (j1,t , . ., jn,t ) associated with qt satisfies a constitutive\nequation of the form\njt (x) = J (qt : x)\n(2.2)\nwhere J is a functional of the field qt and the position x. Consequently, by local conservation, qt evolves according to an autonomous law,\n\u2202\nqt (x) = F (qt ; x)\u2261 \u2212 \u2207.J (qt ; x),\n\u2202t\n\n(2.3)\n\nsubject to boundary conditions that are fixed by the reservoirs**. We assume that the\nresultant qt (x) is confined to the single phase region \u2206, introduced in Sec. 2.1. For\nsimplicity, we base our explicit treatment here on the case of nonlinear diffusions where\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nJ (q; x) = \u2212K qt (x) \u2207qt (x); F (qt ; x) = \u2207. K qt (x) \u2207qt (x) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nand where K(q) is an n-by-n matrix [Kkl (q)] and acts by matrix multiplication on \u2207q .\nThis evolution is therefore invariant under scale transformations x\u2192\u03bbx, t\u2192\u03bb2 t.\nWe choose the unit of length for the hydrodynamic scale to be LN . Thus, in view of\nour stipulation that \u03a9N = LN \u03a9, the region occupied by \u03a3 in the hydrodynamical picture is\n\u03a9. Furthermore, the scale invariance noted after Eq. (2.4) signifies that a length scale LN\n* This assumption may easily be seen to be valid in standard physical cases.\nPN For example, the field representing the position dependent particle number density is r=1 \u03b4(x\u2212xr ),\nwhere xr is the position of the r'th particle.\n** As discussed in [4], these conditions serve to equate the spatial boundary value of the\nlocal control variable \u03b8t (x) := s\u2032 (qt (x)) with that of the reservoir R\u03b1 that is in contact\nwith \u03a3 at x.\n4\n\n\fcorresponds to a time scale L2N . We assume that that there is just one hydrodynamically\nsteady state of the system, as represented by the field q(x) and the current j(x) for which\nF (q; x) = 0 and j(x) = J (q; x). To lighten the notation, we define\nKq := K\u25e6q; Jq := J\u25e6q; K\u0303q := Kq Jq .\n\n(2.5)\n\nHydrodynamical Perturbations of the Steady State. By Eq. (2.3), the linearised equations of motion for 'small' perturbations \u03b4qt and \u03b4jt of the steady state field and current\nq(x) and j(x), respectively, are\n\u03b4jt (x) = K\u03b4qt (x) :=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nJ (q + \u03b4qt ; x)|\u03bb=0 ;\n\u03b4qt (x) = L\u03b4qt (x) :=\nF (q + \u03b4qt ; x)|\u03bb=0 .\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03bb\n(2.6)\n\nWe note that, since qt and jt are rescaled expectation values of the distribution valued\nquantum fields q\u0302t and \u0135t , it follows that they too are distributions. Specifically, denoting\nby D(\u03a9) and DV (\u03a9) the L. Schwartz spaces [19] of real, infinitely differentiable scalar and\nvector valued functions, respectively, on \u03a9 with support in the interior of that region, we\ntake \u03b4qt and \u03b4jt to be elements of the duals, D \u2032n (\u03a9) and DV\u2032n (\u03a9), of the n-fold tensorial\npowers, D n (\u03a9) and DVn (\u03a9), of D(\u03a9) and DV (\u03a9), respectively. We denote elements of\nD n (\u03a9) and DVn (\u03a9) by f = (f1 , . ., fn ) and g = (g1 , . ., gn ), respectively, and we equip these\nlatter spaces with inner products (., .) and (., .)V , respectively, defined by the formulae\nXn Z\nXn Z\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndxgr (x).gr\u2032 (x).\n(2.7)\ndxfr (x)fr (x); (g, g )V =\n(f, f ) =\nr=1\n\nr=1\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nAccording to the above definitions, L is a linear transformation of D \u2032n (\u03a9) and K is a\nlinear mapping of D \u2032n (\u03a9) into DV\u2032n (\u03a9). By Eqs. (2.3) and (2.6), these linear operators are\nrelated by the equation\nL = \u2212\u2207.K.\n(2.8)\nWe assume that L is the generator of a one-parameter semigroup {Tt |t\u2208R+ } = T (R+ )\nof linear transformations of D \u2032n (\u03a9), and we denote the duals of L and Tt by L\u22c6 and Tt\u22c6 ,\nrespectively. Thus, by Eq. (2.6),\n\u03b4qt = Tt\u2212s \u03b4qs ; \u03b4jt = \u2212KTt\u2212s \u03b4qs \u2200 t\u2265s.\n\n(2.9)\n\n2.3. Connection between the Quantum and Hydrodynamical Pictures.\nIn order to bring our formulation of the quantum field q\u0302t (x) and current \u0135t (x) into\nline with their hydrodynamical counterparts, we rescale the position x and the time t by\nthe factors LN and L2N , respectively. The resultant quantum field q\u0303t (x) and current j\u0303t (x)\nare therefore given by the formulae\nq\u0303t (x) = q\u0302(LN x, L2N t); j\u0303t (x) = LN \u0135(LN x, L2N t).\n5\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fThus, q\u0303t and j\u0303t satisfy the local conservation law\n\u2202 q\u0303t\n+ \u2207.j\u0303t = 0.\n\u2202t\nWe assume that, in general, the phenomenological fields qt and jt of Sec. 2.2 are just\nthe expectation values of q\u0303t and j\u0303t , respectively, for the prevailing state of \u03a3c in the limit\nwhere N tends to infinity. In particular, the stationary field q(x) and current j(x) are the\nlimiting values, as N tends to infinity, of h\u03c9 c ; q\u0303(x)i and h\u03c9 c ; j\u0303(x)i, respectively.\nThe Hydrodynamical Fluctuation Fields. We represent the fluctuations of the hydrodynamic field q\u0303t and current j\u0303t about their means for the steady state \u03c9 c by the fluctuation\nfield \u03be \u0303t = (\u03be \u03031,t , . ., \u03be\u0303n,t) and its associated current \u03b7\u0303t = (\u03b7\u03031,t , . ., \u03b7\u0303n,t ), as defined by the\nformulae\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03be \u0303t (x) = N 1/2 q\u0303t (x) \u2212 h\u03c9 c ; q\u0303t (x)i ; \u03b7\u0303t (x) = N 1/2 j\u0303t (x) \u2212 h\u03c9 c ; j\u0303t (x)i ,\n(2.11)\nthe factor N 1/2 being canonical for fluctuations [20]. It follows immediately from these\ndefinitions that the local conservation law for q\u0302t implies the corresponding one for \u03be \u0303t , which\nwe express in the following integral form.\n\u03be \u0303t \u2212 \u03be \u0303s + \u03b6\u0303t,s = 0 \u2200 t, s\u2208R,\nwhere\n\u03b6\u0303t,s =\n\nZ\n\n(2.12)\n\nt\n\ndu\u2207.\u03b7\u0303u .\n\n(2.13)\n\ns\n\n3.The Fluctuation Process.\nWe denote by \u03be \u0303t (f ) and \u03b6\u0303t,s (g) the time-dependent smeared fields obtained by integrating \u03be \u0303t and \u03b6\u0303t,s against test functions f (\u2208D n (\u03a9)) and g (\u2208DVn (\u03a9)), respectively. The\nstatistical properties of these smeared fields in the steady state \u03c9 c are then represented by\nthe correlation functions given by the expectation values, for this state, of the monomials\nin the \u03be \u0303t (f )'s and the \u03b6\u0303t,s (g)'s. We assume that these functions are continuous in all their\narguments (the test functions f, g and the time variables s, t) and converge, as N \u2192\u221e, to\n\u0001\ncorresponding finite valued ones for a stochastic process executed by fields \u03bet (f ), \u03b6t,s(g) ,\nrespectively: conditions for the validity of these assumptions are specified in [4]. Then,\nin view of the completeness of the Schwartz D-spaces, the correlation functions for the\nresultant process are continuous in the test functions f and g and measurable in the time\nvariables. Further,\nunder general space-time asymptotic abelian conditions on the fields\n\u0001\n \u0303\n\u03bet (f ), \u03b6\u0303t,s (g) , the process is classical [4]. Thus, assuming these conditions, the quantum\n \u0303 \u03b6\u0303) converges in law, as N tends to infinity, to the classical process (\u03be, \u03b6). It\nprocess (\u03be,\nfollows immediately that \u03be and \u03b6 satisfy the natural counterpart of the local conservation\nlaw (2.12), which when integrated against a test function f (\u2208D n (\u03a9)) takes the form\n\u03bet (f ) \u2212 \u03bes (f ) = \u03b6t,s (\u2207f ).\n6\n\n(3.1)\n\n\f3.1. The Regression Hypothesis.\nWe assume a natural generalisation of Onsager's [1] regression hypothesis to the effect\nthat the fluctuation field \u03bet regresses according to the same dynamical law as the weak\nexternally induced perturbations \u03b4qt of the stationary hydrodynamical field q. Thus, since\nthe latter law is given by Eq. (2.9) , we take our regression hypothesis to be that\nE(\u03bet |\u03bes ) = Tt\u2212s \u03bes \u2200 t\u2265s,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere E(.|\u03bes) denotes the conditional expectation given the field \u03bes at time s. Hence,\ndenoting the static two-point function by\n\u0001\nW (f, f \u2032 ) := E \u03be(f )\u03be(f \u2032) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nit follows from Eq. (3.2) and the stationarity of the \u03be-process that\n\u0001\n\u22c6\nE \u03bet (f )\u03bes (f \u2032 ) = W (Tt\u2212s\nf, f \u2032 ) \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), t, s(\u2264t)\u2208R.\n\n(3.4)\n\nWe further develop the relation between fluctuations\ninduced hydrodyRt\nR t and externally\nnamical perturbations by noting that, by Eq. (2.6), s du\u03b4ju = s duK\u03b4qu . Correspondingly, we designate the secular part of the time-integrated current fluctuation \u03b6t,s to be\nRt\nduK\u03beu , and we define the remainder of \u03b6t,s to be its stochastic part, namely\ns\nstoc\n\u03b6t,s\n\n= \u03b6t,s \u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nduK\u03beu .\n\n(3.5)\n\ns\n\nIt follows then from Eqs. (2.8) and (3.5) that the local conservation law (3.1) is equivalent\nto the following equation.\n\u03bet (f ) \u2212 \u03bes (f ) \u2212\n\nZ\n\ns\n\nt\nstoc\ndu\u03beu (L\u22c6 f ) = \u03b6t,s\n(\u2207f ).\n\n(3.6)\n\nSince L is the generator of T (R+ ), it follows from this equation, after some manipulation\n[4], that the two-point function of \u03b6 stoc is related to that of \u03be according to the formula\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE \u03b6t,s (\u2207f )\u03b6t\u2032 ,s\u2032 (\u2207f \u2032 ) = \u2212 W (L\u22c6 f, f \u2032 ) + W (f, L\u22c6 f \u2032 ) |[s, t]\u2229[s\u2032 , t\u2032 ]|\n\u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), t, s, t\u2032 , s\u2032 \u2208R,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere the last factor is the length of the intersection of the intervals (s, t) and (s\u2032 , t\u2032 ).\n3.2. The Chaoticity Hypothesis.\nWe assume that the stochastic current is chaotic in the sense that the space-time\nstoc\ncorrelations of the unsmeared stochastic field \u03b6t,s\nare of short range on the microscopic\nscale and therefore, since LN tends to infinity with N , of zero range on the hydrodynamic\n7\n\n\fscale. Further, in accordance with the central limit theorem for fluctuation fields with short\nrange correlations [21], we assume that the process \u03b6 stoc is Gaussian. Thus our chaoticity\nassumption is that\n(C.1) the process \u03b6 stoc is Gaussian; and\n\u0001\nstoc\n(C.2)E \u03b6t,s\n(g)\u03b6t\u2032 ,s\u2032 (g \u2032 ) = 0 if either (s, t)\u2229(s\u2032 , t\u2032 ) or supp(g)\u2229supp(g \u2032 ) is empty.\n\nThe following proposition was inferred* in [4] from this assumption and Schwartz's\ncompact and point support theorems [20, Ths. 26,35].\nProposition 3.1. Under the assumption (C.2), the two-point function for \u03b6 takes the\nform\n\u0001\nE \u03b6t,s (g)\u03b6t\u2032 ,s\u2032 (g \u2032 ) = Z(g, g \u2032)|[s, t]\u2229[s\u2032 , t\u2032 ]| \u2200 g, g \u2032\u2208D n (\u03a9), t, s, t\u2032 , s\u2032 \u2208R,\n(3.8)\nwhere Z is an element of D \u2032n (\u03a9)\u2297D \u2032n (\u03a9) with support in the domain {(x, x)|x\u2208\u03a9}.\n\nThe following corollary to this proposition follows immediately from a comparison of\nEqs. (3.7) and (3.8).\nCorollary 3.2. Under the same assumptions,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ(\u2207f, \u2207f \u2032 ) = \u2212 W (L\u22c6 f, f \u2032 ) + W (f, Lf \u2032 ) \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9).\n\n(3.9)\n\n3.3. The Local Equilibrium Hypothesis.\nFor an equilibrium state, the static two point function for the field \u03be has been derived\nfrom the KMS condition in the following form [2, Ch. 7, Appendix C].\n\u0001\n\u0001\nWeq (f, f \u2032 )\u2261Eeq \u03beeq (f )\u03beeq (f \u2032 ) = f, Jq f \u2032 \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9),\n(3.10)\nwhere the subscript eq, here and elsewhere, refers to the equilibrium state and the function\nJq and the inner product (., .) and are defined in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.7), respectively. Further,\nthe process \u03beeq inherits from its underlying quantum dynamics the property of invariance\nunder time reversals. Hence, in view of the stationarity of this process, it follows from a\nstandard argument [4] that\nWeq (L\u22c6eq f, f \u2032 ) = Weq (L\u22c6eq f \u2032 , f ) \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9).\n\n(3.11)\n\nTurning now to the process \u03b6 stoc , we see that, by translational invariance of the\nequilibrium state, it follows from by Eqs. (2.4)-(2.6) that Leq = Kq \u2206 and thence, by Eqs.\n(2.7), (3.9) and (3.10), that\n\u0001\n(3.12)\nZeq (\u2207f, \u2207f \u2032 ) = \u2207f, [K\u0303q + K\u0303q\u22c6 ]\u2207f \u2032 V ,\n* In fact the proof in [4] invoked the supplementary assumption that the l.h.s of Eq.\n(3.8) was continuous in its time variables. However, that assumption is redundant, since\nthe required continuity can be derived by exploiting the positivity of that formula for\nf = f \u2032 , t = t\u2032 , s = s \u2032 .\n8\n\n\fwhere K\u0303q\u22c6 is the transpose of the matrix K\u0303q . Further, a simple argument based on the\nrotational symmetry of the equilibrium state leads to an extension of this formula to the\nfollowing one [4].\n\u0001\nZeq (g, g \u2032) = g, [K\u0303q + K\u0303q\u22c6 ]g \u2032 V \u2200 g, g \u2032 \u2208DVn (\u03a9).\n(3.13)\nEqs. (3.10), (3.11) and (3.13) are our equilibrium conditions for the fluctuation process. We now formulate the local properties of these conditions in terms of test functions\nthat are highly localised around an arbitrary point x0 of \u03a9. Thus, for x0 \u2208\u03a9 and sufficiently\nsmall \u01eb\u2208R+ , we define the transformations f \u2192fx0 ,\u01eb of D n (\u03a9) and g\u2192gx0 ,\u01eb of DVn (\u03a9) by\nthe formulae\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfx0 ,\u01eb (x) = \u01eb\u2212d/2 f \u01eb\u22121 (x \u2212 x0 ) ; gx0 ,\u01eb (x) = \u01eb\u2212d/2 g \u01eb\u22121 (x \u2212 x0 ) .\n(3.14)\n\nThus, since by Eqs. (2.4)-(2.6), Leq = Kq \u2206 and thus \u01eb2 L\u22c6eq fx0 ,\u01eb = [L\u22c6 f ]x0 ,\u01eb , it follows that\nthe equilibrium conditions (3.10), (3.11) and (3.13) are equivalent to the following ones,\nwhich evidently represent properties at the (hydrodynamical) point x0 in the limit \u01eb\u21920.\n\u0001\nWeq (fx0 ,\u01eb , fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = f, Jq f \u2032 \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9,\n(3.15)\n\u01eb2 Weq (L\u22c6eq fx0 ,\u01eb , fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = \u01eb2 Weq (L\u22c6eq fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb , fx0 ,\u01eb ) \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9,\n\n(3.16)\n\nboth sides of this equation being equal to (L\u22c6eq f, Jq f \u2032 ); and\nZeq (gx0 ,\u01eb , gx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = g, [K\u0303q + K\u0303q\u22c6 ]g \u2032\n\n\u0001\n\nV\n\n\u2200 g, g \u2032\u2208DVn (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9\n\n(3.17)\n\nCorrespondingly, we take our local equilibrium conditions for the nonequilibrium steady\nstate to be given by removing the subscript eq, replacing Jq and Kq in these formulae by\nJq (x0 ) and Kq (x0 ), respectively, and then passing to the limit \u01eb\u21920. Thus, the resultant\nconditions are\n\u0001\nlim\u01eb\u21930 W (fx0 ,\u01eb , fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = f, Jq (x0 )f \u2032 \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9,\n(3.18)\nlim\u01eb\u21930 \u01eb2 W (L\u22c6 fx0 ,\u01eb , fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = lim\u01eb\u21930 \u01eb2 W (L\u22c6 fx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb , fx0 ,\u01eb ) \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9,\n\n(3.19)\n\nand\nlim\u01eb\u21930 Z(gx0 ,\u01eb , gx\u2032 0 ,\u01eb ) = g, [K\u0303q (x0 ) + K\u0303q\u22c6 (x0 )]g \u2032\n\n\u0001\n\nV\n\n\u2200 g, g \u2032\u2208DVn (\u03a9), x0 \u2208\u03a9.\n\n(3.20)\n\nFurther, by Eq. (3.8), the chaoticity assumption (C.2) implies that Z(g, g \u2032) vanishes if the\nsupports of g and g \u2032 are disjoint. Consequently, by Schwartz's compact and point support\ntheorems [20, Ths. 26,35], Eq. (3.20) implies that [4]\nZ(g, g \u2032) = (g, [K\u0303q + K\u0303q\u22c6 ]g \u2032 )V \u2200g, g \u2032 \u2208DV (\u03a9).\n\n(3.21)\n\nHence, by Eq. (3.7),\n\u0001\nstoc\nE \u03b6t,s\n(g)\u03b6t\u2032 ,s\u2032 (g \u2032 ) = (g, [K\u0303q + K\u0303q\u22c6 ]g \u2032 )V |[s, t]\u2229[s\u2032 , t\u2032 ]| \u2200 g, g \u2032 \u2208DVn (\u03a9), t, s, t\u2032 , s\u2032 \u2208R. (3.22)\n9\n\n\f3.4. Generalised Reciprocity Relations and Onsager-Machlup Processes.\nThe following proposition was proved in [4].\nProposition 3.3. Assuming the regression hypotheses and local equilibrium conditions (3.18) and (3.19), the n-by-n matrix-valued function K\u0303q on \u03a9 is symmetric. This\nconstitutes a nonequilibrium, position-dependent generalisation of the Onsager reciprocity\nrelations.\nIn order to show that the Onsager-Machlup theory extends to the present setting, we\ndefine\nstoc\nwt (f ) = \u03b6t,0\n(\u2207f ) \u2200 f \u2208D n (\u03a9), t\u2208R\n(3.23)\nand infer from this formula, together with Eq. (3.22), Prop. 3.1 and the Gaussian condition\n(C.1) that w is the Wiener process whose two-point function is\n\u0001\nE [wt (f ) \u2212 ws (f )][wt\u2032 (f \u2032 ) \u2212 ws\u2032 (f \u2032 )] = 2(\u2207f, K\u0303q \u2207f \u2032 )V \u2200 f, f \u2032 \u2208D n (\u03a9)V , t, s, t\u2032 , s\u2032 \u2208R.\n(3.24)\nThe following proposition then ensues immediately from Eqs. (3.6), (3.23) and (3.24).\nProposition 3.4. Assuming the regression, chaoticity and local equilibrium hypothese, the \u03be-field executes a generalised Onsager-Machlup process given by the Langevin\nequation\nd\u03bet = L\u03bet dt + dwt ,\n(3.25)\nwhere w is the Wiener process specified above.\n4. Long Range Correlations of the \u03be-Process.\nThe next proposition and the subsequent comment signify that, under the above\nassumptions, the spatial correlations of the \u03be field are generically of non-zero range on the\nmacroscopic scale and hence of long (infinite!) range on the microscopic one.\nProposition 4.1. Let \u03a6q and \u03a8q be the be the n-by-n matrix valued scalar and vector\nfields, respectively, in \u03a9 defined by the formula\n\u03a6q = \u2206K\u0303q + \u2207.\u03a8q\n\n(4.1)\n\nand\n\u03a8q;k,l (x) =\n\nXn\n\nk\u2032 ,l\u2032 =1\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0001\u0003\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u2202\nKk,k\u2032 q(x) Jl,l\u2032 q(x) \u2207qk\u2032 (x) \u2212 Jk\u2032 ,l q(x) \u2207ql\u2032 (x) . (4.2)\n\u2202ql\u2032 (x)\n\nThen, under the assumptions of the regression, chaoticity and local equilibrium hypotheses,\na sufficient condition for the static spatial correlations of the \u03be-process to be of non-zero\nrange on the macroscopic scale is that either \u03a6q does not vanish or that the matrix \u03a8q is\nsymmetric.\n10\n\n\fComment. The functions \u03a6q and \u03a8q are determined by the forms of the entropy\nfunction s, the transport coefficient K and the form of q|\u2202\u03a9 , which represents the boundary\nconditions imposed by the reservoirs.on the profile of the function q. Since these functions\nare mutually independent, it follows from Prop. 4.1 that it is only under very special\nconditions that the spatial correlations of the \u03be-field are of zero range on the hydrodynamic\nscale. In other words, these correlations are generically of non-zero range on that scale\nand consequently of infinite range on the microscopic one.\nExample. In the case of the simple exclusion process, whether in the classical picture\n[8-10] or the quantum one [7], n = 1, d = 1, K(q) = 1, s(q) = \u2212qlog(q) \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)log(1 \u2212 q)\nand q(x) = a+bx, where a and b are constants, the latter being non-zero in nonequilibrium\nsteady states. Then it follows from Eqs. (2.1), (4.1) and (4.2) that, in these states, \u03a8q = 0\nand \u03a6q (x) = \u22122b2 6=0. Hence, long (infinite) range correlations prevail in this model.\nProof of Prop. 4.1. We employ a reductio ad absurdum argument. Thus we\nstart by assuming that the spatial correlations of the \u03be-process are of zero range, on the\nhydrodynamic scale, i.e. that the support of W lies in the domain {x, x\u2032 \u2208\u03a9|x = x\u2032 }. Then\nby pursuing the argument used to obtain Eq. (3.21) , we see that this assumption, together\nwith the local equilibrium condition (3.18), implies that\nW (x, x\u2032 ) = Jq (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(4.3)\n\nOn the other hand, Eq. (3.21) and Prop. 3.3 imply that Eq. (3.9) is equivalent to the\nfollowing equation for the distribution W .\n\u0001\n[L + L\u2032 ]W (x, x\u2032 ) = 2\u2207. K\u0303q (x)\u2207\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere L\u2032 is the version of L that acts on functions of x\u2032 . On inserting this formula (4.3)\nfor W into this equation and using Eqs. (2.4)-(2.6), , it follows, after some manipulation,\nthat\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03a6q (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) + \u03a8q (x) \u2212 \u03a8\u22c6q (x) \u03b4 \u2032 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) = 0.\nThus, the assumption that the spatial correlations of the \u03be-process are of zero range on\nthe hydrodynamic scale cannot be sustained unless \u03a6q vanishes and \u03a8q is symmetric.\n5. Concluding Remarks.\nIn this work, the crucial links between quantum microdynamics and classical macroscopic continuum mechanics are provided by the mesoscopic picture of hydrodynamical\nfluctuations. Apart from generalising both the Onsager reciprocity relations and the\nOnsager-Machlup fluctuation process to nonequilibrium steady states, the ensuing theory\nestablishes, on a very general basis, that the spatial correlations of the hydrodynamical\nvariables are generically of infinite range in these states. This result, which had previously\nbeen established for certain classical stochastic models [8-10], marks a crucial difference\nbetween equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states, since the spatial correlations of the\nformer are of short range, except at critical points [22].\n11\n\n\fReferences.\n[1] L.Onsager: Phys.
