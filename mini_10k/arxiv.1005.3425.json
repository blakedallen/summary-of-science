The device contains an\nopen channel that can block electromagnetic waves at a particular frequency range.\nWe also demonstrate that such a device can work in a broad frequency range.\n\nTransformation optics 1, 2 has paved the way for the rational design of conceptual\ndevices which have unprecedented control over the propagation of electromagnetic\nwaves 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Recently, the combination of the complementary\nmedia concept 15 with the transformation optics technique 16 has motivated a series\nof illusion optics devices 17, 18, 19, 20, which can change the electromagnetic scattering\ncross section of an object to create optical illusions. However, such effects are limited\nto theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Using a transmission-line medium,\nwe realized the first experimental demonstration of an illusion optics device, an\n\"invisible gateway\" 21, which is an open channel that appears to be blocked for waves\nof a selected range of frequencies. The gateway is a two dimensional device for\nproof-of-principle purpose. We also measured the performance of the device and\ndemonstrated its broadband functionality.\n\n\fFigure 1 | Schematic picture of an electromagnetic invisible gateway. The air, PEC wall and DNM\nare denoted by green, blue and red colors respectively.\n\nTo start with, let us consider a configuration that is illustrated schematically in Figure\n1. A perfect electric conductor (PEC, marked by blue color) wall partitions space (air,\n\u03b5=\u03bc=1, denoted by green color) into two domains. A channel is then opened in the\nPEC wall with a double negative material (DNM, \u03b5'=\u03bc'=\u20101) filled inside the\ntrapezoidal region (marked by red color) and an air channel. From the viewpoint of\ntransformation optics, the DNM will project the PEC boundary adjacent to it into\nanother optically-equivalent PEC boundary (marked by the dashed line) so that the\nwall with an air channel will look like a continuous PEC wall for the observers\noutside at the designed frequency. In other words, the trapezoidal DNM slab can be\nviewed as a \"complementary medium\" which optically cancels positive index (\u03b5=\u03bc=1)\nof the same thickness so that the open air channel is blocked at the frequency at which\nthe DNM has \u03b5=\u03bc=\u20101. Such an air channel was also called an \"invisible gateway\",\nmeaning that an observer cannot \"see\" the open channel, but would rather see some\nreflection leading to the illusion that the channel is blocked. For the lack of a better\nterm to describe the system, we will use \"invisible gateway\" hereafter.\nElectromagnetic (EM) wave incident from one side of the wall cannot reach to\nanother side while other entities are allowed to pass through the open channel.\nBroadband functionality was also found in such a device in a previous publication.\nHowever, it is challenging to implement such a device electromagnetically due to the\ndifficulty in realizing the DNM even for microwave frequencies. It should be noted\nthat, such an invisible gateway can be applied to both two dimensional (2D) and three\ndimensional (3D) geometries. In this paper, we will only focus on the 2D case.\nFrom the EM theory and the transmission-line (TL) theory, materials with specific\npermittivity and permeability tensors can be mimicked by periodic TL networks to\ngive similar propagation behaviors. The TL versions of conventional double negative\nmaterials (DPMs) and artificial double negative materials (DNMs) have been\ninvestigated several years ago 22 and demonstrated experimentally to have the\nfocusing effect that overcomes the classical diffraction limit 23.\n\n\f(c)\nFigure 2 | Unit cells of periodic L-C structures to mimic the (a) DPMs and (b) DNMs, (c) the real\nexperimental device.\n\nHere, we choose a special kind of TL network - the periodic inductor-capacitor (L-C)\nnetwork to mimic the configuration depicted in Figure 1. The unit cell to mimic the\nair region is shown in Figure 2a, where the series inductor and shunt capacitors can\nact as an isotropic medium with positive equal permittivity and permeability. The\nDNM is mimicked by the dual L-C configuration as shown in Figure 2b, where the\nposition of L and C are interchanged, acting as a material with simultaneously\nnegative values of permittivity and permeability.\nThere is a one-to-one mapping between the L-C network equations and the polarized\ntransverse electric (or magnetic) Maxwell's equations with voltages V and currents I\n\n\fmapped to the field quantities E and H. In the long-wavelength limit, the dimension of\nthe unit cell \u0394 is much smaller than the wavelength, therefore the relationship between\nthe circuit parameters (the capacitance and inductance in the network) and the\nmaterials parameters (the effective permittivity and permeability) can be derived as\n\n\u03b5R =\n\nCR\nL\n, \u03bcR = R ,\n\u0394\n\u0394\n\n\u03b5L = \u2212\n\n1\n1\n, \u03bcL = \u2212 2\n\u03c9 LL \u0394\n\u03c9 CL \u0394\n2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0394 is the length of the unit cell in the x and y direction, and the subscripts \"R\"\nand \"L\" refer to the case of mimicking a DPM and DNM respectively.\nIn order to mimic the invisible gateway device in Figure 1 by using the unit cells of\nL-C network in Figure 2a and 2b, two requirements should be met at the design\nfrequency. One is that both the DPM and DNM network must behave like effective\nmedia with\n\n\u03bc R\u03b5 R f \u0394 \u2264 1 and\n\n\u03bc L\u03b5 L f \u0394 \u2264 1 . The other is \u03b5 L = \u2212\u03b5 R and \u03bc L = \u2212 \u03bc R .\n\nHere we choose the unit cell parameters as \u0394=6mm, LR=47nH, CR=82pF to meet all\nthe above requirements in a design frequency f0=51MHz. These parameters result in\nan effective wavelength of 60mm. The experimental device is illustrated in Figure 2c.\nIt is fabricated on a grounded flame retardant 4 (FR4) substrate of thickness 1mm and\ndielectric constant \u03b5r=4.3. The whole structure has 61 grid nodes in the x direction and\n41 grids in y direction. The distance between two adjacent nodes is equal to the length\nof a unit cell \u0394=6mm (i.e., 0.1\u03bb). The structure measures totally about\n390mm\u00d7270mm. The magnified views of the grid nodes in different regions are also\nshown in the insets of the Figure 2c. The node in the DPM region consists of four\nsurface-mounted inductors in series and one capacitor in shunt to the ground by a\nvia-hole (see schematic plot in Figure 2a). The left-handed unit cell consists of four\nsurface-mounted capacitors in series and one inductor in shunt to the ground by a\nvia-hole (see the schematic plot in Figure 2b). The grounded PEC plates are used to\nmimic the PEC walls in Figure 1. In our design, the outer boundaries of the DPM\nregions are truncated by being connected with Bloch impedances 24 which are\napplied to achieve matching absorption to mimic the infinitely extended background.\nA topology which is very similar to the Yee grids in the finite-difference time-domain\n(FDTD) method is employed at the interface of the DPM region and its\ncomplementary counterpart 25. As shown in the lower inset of Figure 2c, the series\nbranches of the node consists of the parallel connection of 2LR and CL/2, while the\nshunt branche consists of the parallel connection of CR/2 and 2LL. With such a\ntopology, a more precise equivalence to the continuity condition of tangential electric\nand magnetic field at the interface between two different medium can be achieved.\n\n\f(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3 | simulated node voltage distribution. Invisible gateway with DNM (a) for lossless case,\n(b) of very little loss (Q = 105), (c) Q = 10; (d) with PEC instead of DNM.\n\nBefore fabricating the device and performing the experiment, we have evaluated the\nperformance of the device using numerical simulations. We generated the whole\nnetwork in Figure 2c using Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS). In the\nsimulation, a 1-A current source is connected between the center of the node (11, 18)\nand the ground to generate the point source excitation. One advantage of the\nsimulation is that we can study the ideal situation when all the inductors and\ncapacitors are lossless. The simulated result for lossless case at the design frequency\nis shown in Figure 3a. Strong surface waves can be clearly observed at the interface of\nthe DPM and DNM with symmetrical pattern. The waves from the point source are\ncompletely blocked from propagating to the right domain. When a small loss is\nintroduced (the quality factor for all the inductors and capacitors is set to be Q = 105),\nthe pattern of the surface waves changes conspicuously as compared to the lossless\ncase, as shown in Figure 3b. This means that the resonance in the region near the\ninterface is sensitive to the loss, as expected. However, the field in the right domain is\nstill very weak which means that most of the waves excited by the source in the left\ndomain are mostly blocked by the gateway device. This phenomenon can also be\nobserved when Q is set to be 10 as another example, as shown in Fig.3(c). This means\nthe illusion property of the invisible gateway is robust against material loss. This\nimproves the possibility of getting reasonably good results in experiment where loss is\ninevitable. For comparison, Figure 3d shows the simulated voltage distribution when\n\n\fthe DNM in the trapezoidal region is replaced by PEC. In this case, the waves can\nevidently propagate to the right domain.\nTo investigate the realistic performance of the present invisible gateway device, an\nAgilent E5071C vector network analyzer (VNA) was employed to take transmission\ncoefficient measurement, which is in proportional to the voltage of the grid nodes.\nPort 1 of the VNA provides the excitation via a coaxial feed, with its outer conductor\nmounted onto the ground plane at the backside of the FR4 substrate, and its center pin\nextending through a hole in the substrate and soldered to the center of the node (11,\n18), which is same as that in the simulation. Hence, a point source is introduced to\nexcite a cylindrical wave. Port2 of the VNA provides a near-field coaxial probe that\ncan scan over the surface of the whole structure. To ensure the precision of the\nmeasurement, the disturbance of the voltage distribution as the detecting probe\ntouching the node must be well controlled. Here, a broadband amplifier with very\nhigh input impedance is designed and inserted between the detecting probe and Port2\nof the VNA. The amplifier is designed based on the topology of differential amplifier\nwith current feedback. The measured input impedance is more than 2k Ohms and the\nmeasured voltage gain is 20dB\u00b10.2dB over the frequency band from DC to 100MHz.\n\nFigure 4 | Measured node voltage distribution. Gateway with DNM at the trapezoidal region at\nfrequencies (a) f=51MHz, (b) 46MHz, and (c) 56MHz; Gateway with DNM replaced by PEC at\nfrequencies (d) f=51MHz, (e) 46MHz, and (f) 56MHz.\n\n\fFigure 5 | The leaked power from the left domain for the case of DNM and PEC. The data is\nderived from the experimental results.\n\nThe measured results at the design frequency f=51MHz is shown in Figure 4a. For\ncomparison, Figure 4d shows the measured voltage distribution when the DNM is\nreplaced by the PEC. These two results are very similar to the numerical simulations\nshown in Figure 3c and 3d, which verifies that our device has the realistic illusion\nproperty of the invisible gateway. In the frequency band around 51MHz (the designed\nfrequency), the chip inductors and capacitors have non-resonant nature and the values\nof LR, LL and CR , CL change gradually when the frequency changes. Although the\nrequirement of the complementary medium condition is only satisfied strictly at the\ndesigned frequency theoretically, the \"optical cancellation\" property still remains\neffective even if the material properties are slightly off. The reasonably wide\nfunctional bandwidth is evident in Figures 4 and Figure 5. Figure 4b and 4c show\nthe functionalities of the device with DNM at frequencies 46MHz and 56MHz, while\nFigure 4e and 4f show the functionalities of the device with PEC instead of DNM at\nfrequencies 46MHz and 56MHz. It is seen that, the illusion property can clearly be\nextended to such frequencies. To quantitatively evaluate the bandwidth of our device,\nwe calculated the power leaked into the right domain for the case with DNMs, PDNM\nand with PECs instead of DNMs, PPEC based on\nP=\n\n\u2211 V (i ) \u22c5 I\n\n\u2217\nout\n\n(i ),\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nwhere V(i) and Iout(i) are the node voltages and outward currents on the nodes along\nthe right window of the gateway. The leaked power (PDNM and PPEC) are plotted in\nFigure 5 as a function of frequencies. By comparing these two curves, we can state\nthat the device work well from about 35 MHz to 60 MHz.\nTo summarize, we have designed and fabricated a device to mimic an electromagnetic\ninvisible gateway. The simulation and measurement results confirm its functionalities.\nIn addition, such a device works for a rather broadband. This demonstration will be\nhelpful for future design of an electromagnetic \"illusion devices\" at microwave\n\n\ffrequencies. Other metamaterial illusion optical devices (such as an external cloak)\ncan also be designed and emulated by using the similar transmission-line medium.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n(60990323, and 60990320), and the Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, Hong Kong RGC grant 600209.
