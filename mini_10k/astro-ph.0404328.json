We present high resolution spherically symmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of\nthe evolution of a pulsar wind nebula inside the free expanding ejecta of the supernova progenitor. The evolution\nis followed starting from a few years after the supernova explosion and up to an age of the remnant of 1500 years.\nWe consider different values of the pulsar wind magnetization parameter and also different braking indices for the\nspin-down process. We compare the numerical results with those derived through an approximate semi-analytical\napproach that allows us to trace the time evolution of the positions of both the pulsar wind termination shock and\nthe contact discontinuity between the nebula and the supernova ejecta. We also discuss, whenever a comparison is\npossible, to what extent our numerical results agree with former self-similar models, and how these models could\nbe adapted to take into account the temporal evolution of the system. The inferred magnetization of the pulsar\nwind could be an order of magnitude lower than that derived from time independent analytic models.\nKey words. pulsars: general - Shock waves - Stars: winds, outflows - MHD - ISM: supernova remnants\n\n1. Introduction\nPulsars are rapidly spinning magnetized neutron stars\nthat usually form as the result of the core collapse of\nmassive stars (8 \u2212 16 M\u2299 ) in supernova events (SN).\nThe typical energy released in a supernova explosion is\nof order \u223c 1053 erg. Most of this is carried away by\nneutrinos, while only a small fraction (about 1%) goes\ninto a blast wave that sweeps up the outer layers of the\nstar and produces a strong shock propagating in the surrounding medium. The ejected material is initially heated\nby the blast wave and set into motion. Then, while the\nheat is converted into kinetic energy, the ejecta accelerate until the pressure becomes so low as to be dynamically unimportant. When this happens the material finally\nsets into homologous expansion (Chevalier & Soker 1989;\nMatzner & McKee 1999). This phase is usually referred to\nas free expansion of the ejecta.\nAs a consequence of the electromagnetic torques acting\non it, the pulsar supplies a late energy input to the remnant in the form of a relativistic magnetized wind, mainly\nSend offprint requests to: N.Bucciantini\ne-mail: niccolo@arcetri.astro.it\n\nmade of electron-positron pairs and a toroidal magnetic\nfield (Goldreich & Julian 1969; Michel & Li 1999). Most\nof the pulsar rotational energy is carried away by this\nwind, whose propagation velocity is ultra-relativistic, with\ntypical Lorentz factors that, far enough from the light\ncylinder, are estimated to be in the range 104 \u2013 107 . The\ninteraction of the wind with the ejecta expanding at nonrelativistic speed produces a reverse shock that propagates toward the pulsar (Rees & Gunn 1974). In the region bound by the wind termination shock on the inner\nside, and by the ejecta on the outer side, a bubble of relativistically hot magnetized plasma is created. This shines\nthrough synchrotron and Inverse Compton emission in a\nvery broad range of frequencies, from radio wavelengths\nup to gamma rays: this is what we call a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or plerion.\nThe evolution of a PWN inside the free expanding\nejecta depends on many different parameters such as\nthe pulsar luminosity, the density and velocity distribution in the SN ejecta (Dwarkadas & Chevalier 1998;\nFeatherstone et al. 2001; Blondin et al. 1996), the presence of large and/or small scale inhomogeneities\n(Chevalier & Soker 1989; Campbell et al. 2003). In the\n\n\f2\n\nN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\ncase of constant luminosity, and if spherical symmetry\nis assumed, it is possible to derive a simple evolutionary\nequation for the radius of the PWN as a function of time,\nthat results in a power law (Chevalier & Fransson 1992;\nvan der Swaluw et al. 2001). In the case of SN ejecta with\na constant density profile the PWN contact discontinuity\nevolves as t6/5 . For a more detailed description of the various phases of the PWN-SNR evolution see, for example,\nvan der Swaluw et al. (2001) and references therein.\nWhile many analytic and numerical models exist in the literature for the evolution of SNRs, until recently only two classes of analytic models in the\nproper relativistic magnetohydrodynamical regime have\nbeen presented for PWNe: the steady state solution by\nKennel & Coroniti (1984) (KC hereafter), and the selfsimilar solution by Emmering & Chevalier (1987) (EC\nhereafter), which allows for a non zero velocity of the termination shock.\nOnly lately the evolution of PWN-SNR systems\nhas began being investigated through numerical simulations. These have been performed mainly in the\nclassical hydrodynamical (HD) (Blondin et al. 2001;\nvan der Swaluw et al. 2001),\nor\nclassical\nMHD\n(van der Swaluw 2003) regime. However the recent\ndevelopment of codes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) allows one to investigate such systems\nin a proper regime and to quantify the accuracy of\napproximate analytic solutions (Bucciantini et al. 2003).\nBoth KC and EC models rely on two strong assumptions: a constant pulsar spin-down luminosity, and a constant velocity at the outer boundary of the nebula, neither of which applies to a real case nor is consistent\nwith the PWN evolution inside free expanding ejecta.\nWhile both assumptions are known to be unrealistic, the\nmost crucial one, as far as the long-term evolution of\nthe system is concerned, is probably that of constant\npulsar energy input. As we have already mentioned, the\nPWN is powered by the rotational energy lost by the star\ndue to electromagnetic braking, and this loss translates\ninto an increase with time of the pulsar rotation period\n(Lyne & Graham-Smith 1998).\nIn the case of a dipolar magnetic field the torque\nexerted on the star results in the following relation between the spin-down rate and the pulsar frequency \u03a9 (e.g.\nMichel & Li 1999):\n\nwhere n = (\u03b2 + 1)/(\u03b2 \u2212 1), with \u03b2 the braking index.\nEstimated values of Lo may be up to 1038 \u20131040 erg/s.\nDetermining the braking index from observations is\nextremely complicated, as it requires detailed and\nprecise pulsar timing over long time-spans. A measure of n is presently available for four pulsars only\n(Camilo et al. 2000). Among these, one, the Vela pulsar,\nhas n = 6, while all the others have 2 < n < 3. The value\nof \u03c4 can be derived from the pulsar period and spin-down\nrate once n is known.\nIn the following we present 1D high resolution numerical simulations of the structure and evolution of a PWN\ninside free expanding SN ejecta. We extend, for this initial stage, that lasts for about 2000-3000 years (until the\nreverse shock propagating in the SNR collapses on the\nPWN), previous work on the subject by Bucciantini et al.\n(2003).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\npresent a semi-analytic model for the evolution of the\nPWN radius and the pulsar wind termination shock, valid\nfor any power-law profile of the ejecta and for any value\nof n. After briefly describing, in Section 3, the numerical\ncode employed and the initial conditions of our simulations, we present, in Section 4, the results obtained for\ndifferent values of the braking index, n = 0, 2, 3, and different magnetizations of the wind. We discuss these results\nand compare them with the expectations of the analytic\nEC model. A formula is derived for the spin-down factorization, and the new results are applied to the case of Crab\nNebula. In Section 5 we summarize our conclusions.\n\n\u03a9\u0307 \u221d \u2212\u03a93 ;\n\n3\nEpwn = 4\u03c0 Rcd\nPcd ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhile the power supplied to the wind changes with time t\nas:\nLo\n,\n(2)\n\u2212 I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307 = L(t) =\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )2\nwhere I is the momentum of inertia of the pulsar, \u03c4 is\nthe characteristic spin-down time, and Lo is the initial\npulsar luminosity. More generally, if the field is not exactly\ndipolar one can write the pulsar (or wind) luminosity as:\nL(t) =\n\nLo\n,\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )n\n\n(3)\n\n2. A semi-analytic preamble\nIn this section we shall derive some approximate relations\nfor the evolution of a PWN interacting with the SN ejecta:\nthese will be of use to interpret the numerical results of\nSection 4. Our main goal will be to find an expression for\nthe time evolution of the position of the termination shock\n(Rts (t)) and of the contact discontinuity (Rcd (t)).\nFirst of all, using the results found by Bucciantini et al.\n(2003), we write the total (magnetic plus particle) energy\ninside the PWN as:\n(4)\n\nwith Pcd the total pressure at the contact discontinuity.\nThe validity of this equation is easy to prove in the two extreme cases: if we assume for the PWN a non magnetized\nbubble with constant thermal pressure or a magnetically\ndominated bubble with magnetic field B \u221d r\u22121 . However,\nthe simulations we present in the following (Section 4)\nsupport the idea that this relation holds to a very good\napproximation (within 0.3% error), whatever the spatial\ndistribution of magnetic field and thermal energy in the\nnebula, and for all values of n considered.\n\n\fN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\nFrom Eq. 4, it follows that the evolution of Epwn , including the pulsar input and the effects of adiabatic expansion, can be written in the form:\nd\n3\n2\n(4\u03c0 Rcd\nPcd ) = L(t) \u2212 4\u03c0 Rcd\nPcd \u1e58cd .\ndt\nIntegration by parts leads to:\nZ t\n1\nL(s)Rcd (s)ds .\nPcd (t) =\n4\u03c0Rcd (t)4 0\n\n(5)\n\n3\n\nto express the latter in terms of the enclosed mass, in the\nfollowing way:\n\u0012 \u00133\u2212\u03be\nW\nR\nM=\n. (9)\n(\u03b1 \u2212 1)(\u03b1 + 1) (\u03b1 + (3 \u2212 \u03be)(\u03b1 \u2212 1)) t\nWe have chosen the factor W in the above equation in\nsuch a way that the following simple expansion law holds\nfor a constant energy input by the pulsar:\n\n(6)\n\nThis latter equation makes it clear that, for given ejecta\nproperties, once L(t) is assigned, both Rcd (t) and Pcd (t)\nare uniquely determined, independently of the wind magnetization.\nWhat does depend on the wind magnetization is the\ninternal pressure profile: while in a HD case the pressure\njust behind the shock would be almost equal to Pcd (t),\nin a MHD case it will be higher. Moreover the ratio of\nthe post-shock pressure over the wind ram pressure (just\nupstream of the shock) will depend on the termination\nshock speed. Approximate pressure balance at the shock\nwill still hold in all cases where the shock speed is low\ncompared to the speed of light. We can then write:\nRt\nL(t)\nPts (t) 0 L(s)Rcd (s)ds\n,\n(7)\n2 (t)c \u2248 Pts (t) = P (t)\n4 (t)\n4\u03c0Rts\n4\u03c0Rcd\ncd\nwhere in the latter equality we made use of the expression\nin Eq. 6 for Pcd (t). It should be noticed that both Pcd and\nPts are here defined as including only the contribution of\nthermal plus magnetic pressure in the nebula, whereas the\nparticle ram pressure is neglected. The latter is expected\nto be negligible at the outer boundary of the nebula, while\nin a truly steady-state situation it would contribute 1/3\nof the total pressure just behind the shock.\nEq. 7 allows one to derive the time-evolution of the termination shock radius, once Rcd (t) is known, and a model\nfor the behavior of the ratio Pts /Pcd as a function of time\nis provided. As far as the first task is concerned, a simple analytic description of how the contact discontinuity\nposition evolves with time can be found under the thinlayer approximation. In this approximation, Rcd (t) can be\nderived from the following equation:\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ t\nRcd\n2\n, (8)\nRcd (t\u2032 )L(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 = Rcd\nMsh R\u0308cd + \u1e40sh \u1e58cd \u2212\nt\n0\nwhere\nMsh\nis\nthe\nmass\nof\nthe\nshocked\nejecta. Eq. 8 is obtained by combining (e.g.\nReynolds & Chevalier 1984)mass and momentum conservation with the energy conservation law of Eq. 5.\nIt is possible to derive a power series approximation of\nEq. 8, which allows an analytic description of the evolution\nof Rcd at any time. It is worth stressing that the series\nexpansion we present in the following can be applied to\nthe case of a general braking law for the plerion-feeding\npulsar (Eq. 3), as well as to the case of a general powerlaw density profile of the ejecta \u03c1ej \u221d t\u03be\u22123 r\u2212\u03be . We prefer\n\nRcd,o (t) = (L/W )\u03b1o \u22121 t\u03b1o = R\u0304cd (t/\u03c4 )\u03b1o ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b1o = (6 + \u03be)/(5 + \u03be), and the latter equality defines\nR\u0304cd . In the general case of a fading L(t) (described by\nEq. 3), the evolution of Rcd is not exactly a power-law.\nWhile, as shown by Eq. 10, at times much smaller than \u03c4\nthe best-fit power-law expansion has an index \u03b1 = \u03b1o , at\nvery late times the evolution of Rcd is well approximated\nby a linear law (i.e. \u03b1 = 1).\nWe employ a series expansion that is capable of describing the evolution of Rcd at all times, and which has\na functional form that allows the time-integral in Eq. 7 to\nbe performed analytically. Let us introduce the variable\ns = (t/\u03c4 )/(1 + t/\u03c4 ): the temporal range [0, \u221e] maps into\nthe range [0, 1] for s.\nLet us then express Rcd (t) by the series:\n\u221e\n\nRcd (t) = R\u0304cd\n\ns\u03b1o X i\nci s ,\n1 \u2212 s i=0\n\n(11)\n\nwith c0 = 1. The factor in front of the series guarantees\nthat, for t \u226a \u03c4 , Rcd (t) is well approximated by Rcd,o (t),\nwhile at larger times Rcd (t) \u221d t.\nAn advantage of this functional form is that the series\nconverges at all times, while a simple power series of t has\nbeen found not to converge for t > \u03c4 . The values of the\nvarious coefficients can be easily obtained in the case of\nconstant L (i.e. n = 0), where Rcd follows Eq. 10, which\nimplies:\n\u0013\n\u221e \u0012\n\u221e\nX\nX\n(\u22121)i \u0393(2 \u2212 \u03b1o )\ni\n1\u2212\u03b1o\nsi\n=\nci s = (1 \u2212 s)\n\u0393(2\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\u2212\ni)\u0393(1\n+\ni)\no\ni=0\ni=0\n(we have used the binomial expansion).\nIn the case of a general n, Eq. 8 must be directly solved\nin order to obtain the coefficients ci . The first ones are:\n(49 \u2212 9\u03be) \u2212 n(11 \u2212 2\u03be)\n,\n(12)\n245 \u2212 94\u03be + 9\u03be 2\nh\nc2 = \u2212 ((49 \u2212 9\u03be)2 (\u22127038 + 4029\u03be \u2212 764\u03be 2 + 48\u03be 3 ))\n\nc1 =\n\n+n(\u22126398469 + 5961745\u03be \u2212 2216513\u03be 2 + 411061\u03be 3\n\n\u221238028\u03be 4 + 1404\u03be 5) + n2 (624393 \u2212 577770\u03be\ni\n+213273\u03be 2 \u2212 39259\u03be 3 + 3604\u03be 4 \u2212 132\u03be 5 )\n.h\ni\n(2(49 \u2212 9\u03be)2 (5 \u2212 \u03be)2 (1173 \u2212 476\u03be + 48\u03be 2 ) , (13)\n\nwhile the further ones are too complicated to be listed\nhere.

The discrepancy increases\nwith time up to an asymptotic value of 18%, 13%, 11%\nand 9%, respectively, for the first to fourth degree approximations. In the range of times shorter than 3\u03c4 (as in\nour simulations, see next section), the errors are not larger\nthan 4.7%, 2.2%, 1.2%, and 0.7%, for approximations of\nincreasing degree.\nThe expression chosen for Rcd (t) (Eq. 11) contains only\nterms proportional\nto (t/\u03c4 )\u03bc (1 + t/\u03c4 )\u03bd , and therefore the\nR\nintegral LR dt can be evaluated as a series of hypergeometric functions:\n\u0012 \u00131+\u03b1o +i\nZ t\n\u221e\nX\nci\nt\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nL(t )R(t ) dt = R\u0304cd Lo \u03c4\n1 + \u03b1o + i \u03c4\n0\ni=0\n2 F1\n\n(n \u2212 1 + \u03b1o + i, 1 + \u03b1o + i, 2 + \u03b1o + i; \u2212t/\u03c4 ) , (14)\n\nwhere 2 F1 (a, b, c; z) is the hypergeometric function.\nGiven Eq. 11, Eq. 14 and the coefficients ci , what is\nleft to find, in order to obtain the time evolution of Rts\nfrom Eq. 7, is an expression for the ratio Pts /Pcd as a\nfunction of time. This can be easily accomplished under\nthe approximations that the PWN always adjusts itself to\na quasi-steady solution and that the fluid motion is nonrelativistic everywhere behind the termination shock. Let\nus define the quantity \u03a0 \u2261 P/(\u03c1u c2 \u03b3 2 ), where \u03c1u is the\nmatter density and \u03b3 the Lorentz factor of the realtivistic\nwind at the termination shock. Following KC, one finds\nfor \u03a0 the approximate expression:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3y 2\n27\n2+\n,\n(15)\n\u03a0(y) =\nG(y)4\nG(y)2\n\nwith y a non-dimensional coordinate related to the distance from the shock r, and to the magnetization of the\nwind \u03c3 (supposed to be low),\ny(r) =\n\nr\n\n81 \u03c3 r\n,\n2 Rts\n\n(16)\n\nand the function G(y) (see KC) given by:\nh\ni\u22121/3\np\nG(y) = 1 + 1 + y 2 + (1 + y 2 )2 \u2212 1\n+\ni1/3\nh\np\n.\n+ 1 + y 2 + (1 + y 2 )2 \u2212 1\n\n(17)\n\nWe use for the magnetization parameter \u03c3 the definition\n\u03c3 \u2261 B 2 /(4\u03c0\u03c1c2 \u03b3 2 ) with B and \u03c1 the wind magnetic field\nand matter proper density respectively.\nWe emphasize that the normalized pressure profile in\nEq. 15 is straightforward to obtain as a solution of the\nsteady-state MHD equations under the assumption that\nthe post-shock bulk Lorentz factor of the fluid is \u03b3 = 1\nand that \u03c3 \u226a 1. The first term in Eq. 15 is the thermal\npressure, while the second term is the magnetic contribution, as can be easily checked evaluating the expression in\nthe proper limits of \u03c3 and hence y.\nThe ratio Pts /Pcd in Eq. 7, which we shall indicate\nhereafter as 1/K, can be expressed in terms of \u03a0 as:\n1\nPts (t)\n\u03a00\n=\n=\n(18)\nK(t)\nPcd (t)\n\u03a0(y(Rcd (t)))\np\nwith \u03a00 = \u03a0(y(Rts (t)) = \u03a0( 81\u03c3/2). It is apparent that\nunder these simplified assumptions the ratio between the\nvalue of the pressure at the termination shock and that at\nthe contact discontinuity depends on time only implicitly,\nthrough the ratio between Rts and Rcd .\n\n\fN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\n5\n\nIn light of Eq. 18 we can rewrite\np Eq. 7 as an implicit\nequation for ycd (t) \u2261 y(Rcd (t)) = 81\u03c3/2 Rcd (t)/Rts (t):\n\nto this asymptotic value, even small fluctuations, originating at the PWN-SNR interface, can produce substantial\nvariations in the internal structure.\n81\u03c3 \u03c4 c\n2\nAnother source of problems is numerical diffusion at\n\u03a00 Q(t) ,\n(19)\nycd (t) \u03a0(ycd (t)) \u2248\n2 R\u0304cd\nthe contact discontinuity itself. This has the effect of\nspreading the density jump at the contact discontinuity\nwhere Q(t) can be determined using Eq. 11 and Eq. 14:\nover a few computational cells.

Hence the equation can be easily solved numerically to obtain the shock position as a function of time.\nAs we shall see in the following, this approach, despite being extremely simplified, allows one to trace the evolution\nof the termination shock radius with an accuracy of order\n15%, once the value of Rcd and Rts are known at a reference time. In fact, as already mentioned, the first equality\nin Eq. 7 holds only within a 15-25%, and this means that\nEq. 19 must be normalized to observations (or to simulations) to provide a good estimate of the position of the\ntermination shock at any given time.\n\n3. Numerical simulations\nThe simulations we present have been performed by using the newly developed scheme by Del Zanna et al.\n(Del Zanna & Bucciantini 2002; Del Zanna et al. 2003).\nWe refer the reader to the cited papers for a detailed description of the code, and of the equations and algorithms\nemployed. This is a high resolution conservative (shockcapturing) code for 3D-RMHD based on third order accurate ENO-type reconstruction algorithms. The approximate Riemann solver employed is the two-speed HLL\nflux formula, which does not make use of time-consuming\ncharacteristics waves decomposition. Given the presence\nof very strong shocks we have used second order reconstruction, to reduce post-shock oscillations.\nWe have used a single fluid model, assuming an adiabatic coefficient equal to 4/3 also for the SN ejecta. This\nmakes the ejecta more compressible but does not change\nthe temporal evolution of the PWN. We have chosen to use\na single fluid because, in numerical simulations, the use of\ntwo different adiabatic coefficients on a contact discontinuity with a very large density jump (density may change\nby factors of order 106 \u2212 107 ), leads to the formation of\nspurious disturbances that tend to propagate back into\nthe PWN (Shyue 1998; Karni 1998; Kun & Jishan 1998;\nBucciantini et al. 2003).\nWhen a magnetic field is present the speed of a shocked\nwind cannot drop to zero but tends to a finite value Vasy\n(see e.g. KC). If the contact discontinuity velocity is close\n\n3.1. Initial conditions\nSimulations have been performed on a logarithmic radial\ngrid, with 200 cells per decade. This allows one to resolve\nwith sufficient accuracy the inner region so that the termination shock always remains inside the computational\ndomain and injection ambiguities such as those discussed\nby Bucciantini et al. (2003) are avoided. At the same time,\nwith our choice of the grid we are able to follow the system evolution from very early times (a few years) after the\nSN explosion and up to an advanced age, maintaining diffusion effects homogeneous throughout the evolution. We\nset continuous conditions at the outer boundary (zeroth\norder extrapolation). No radiation cooling is included.\nFor the free expanding ejecta we have chosen the following profiles (Chevalier & Fransson 1992):\n\u03c1ej = At\u22123\nv = r/t = Vo r/Ro ,\n\nRo (t) = Vo t,\n\n(21)\n\nwith A = 8.7 \u00d7 106 g s3 /cm3 and Vo = 5.27 \u00d7 108 cm/s,\ncorresponding to an energy release in the SN explosion\nE = 1051 erg and ejecta having mass M \u2243 4M\u2299 . The\npulsar wind is created injecting mass, momentum-energy,\nand a purely toroidal magnetic field in the first computational cell, with a total luminosity that depends on time as\ndescribed by Eq. 3, with Lo = 5 \u00d7 1039 erg/s, and \u03c4 = 500\nyears. Three different values for the spin-down index have\nbeen used: n = 0, 2, 3. No magnetic field is initially present\nin the SNR nor in the ISM.\nThe simulations are initialized with a 5 years old PWN\nsurrounded by a thin shell of swept up ejecta at a radius\nRcd = 0.022 ly. This shell contains the ejecta material removed from the origin by the relativistic bubble. The evolution of the PWN is followed up to an age t = 3 \u03c4 = 1500\nyears. The internal profile of the fluid in the PWN is taken\nfrom the EC solution with proper magnetization, fitted to\nthe contact discontinuity velocity. After a short transient\nphase of about 10\u201315 years, partly due to numerical effects, the nebula relaxes to a stable configuration. Our\nchoice of initial conditions is such that the system is not\nfar from the self-similar solution. This allows us to avoid\n\n\f6\n\nN.

Numerical results\n\nFig. 1. Evolution with time for the n = 0 case of the\nposition of the contact discontinuity (solid line) and of the\ntermination shock for the hydrodynamics (dotted line),\nthe \u03c3 = 0.0016 (dashed line) and the \u03c3 = 0.003 (dashdotted line) cases.\n\n4.1. Constant luminosity case\nThe first step we take is the comparison of our numerical results with the analytic model by EC in the case\nwith n = 0. The EC model is completely determined once\nthe wind quantities (density, pressure, magnetic field and\nLorentz factor) and the termination shock velocity are\nknown. Given the value of the termination shock speed,\nVts , the shock jump conditions are evaluated at the termination shock radius, Rts , and then the self-similar, spherically symmetric, RMHD equations are integrated using\nthe post-shock values as initial conditions. A singularity\nappears in the solution at some distance from the termination shock: the position of this singularity corresponds\nto the outer boundary of the nebula.\nThe self-similar solution of EC requires Vts to be constant and equal to a given fraction of the contact discontinuity velocity Vcd , also constant:\nVts =\n\nRts\nVcd .\nRcd\n\n(22)\n\nWe notice that the latter equation can be derived directly from the general expression in Eq. 7. Let us assume\na constant pulsar energy input, L = L0 and the evolution\nof Rcd described by a power-law: Rcd \u221d t\u03b1 . The timederivative of Eq. 7 gives:\n#\n\"\nRts\nRcd Rcd K\u0307\nVts =\n,\n(23)\n3Vcd \u2212\n+\n2Rcd\nt\nK\nwhich, in the self-similar case (i.e. \u03b1 = 1 and dK/dt = 0),\nreduces to Eq. 22. More generally, for Rcd (t) still described\nby a power-law but with an index \u03b1 6= 1, if the variation of\nK in time can be neglected, we find Rts \u221d t(3\u03b1\u22121)/2 . While\nin a HD case, one will have K \u2248 const \u2248 1 (see also Eq. 15\nin the limit y \u2192 0), the time-variation of K will become\nmore and more important the larger the magnetization of\nthe wind.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the evolution of Rcd derived\nfrom our simulations: this turns out to be independent of the magnetization, as stressed by Bucciantini\n\net al. (2003). The temporal evolution agrees with the\nbehavior Rcd \u221d t6/5 predicted by the analytic models\n(Chevalier & Fransson 1992; van der Swaluw et al. 2001).\nThe value of Vts changes with the magnetization and is\nlower for larger values of \u03c3.\nWe find that the evolution of the termination shock is\nwell described by a power law in time Rts \u221d t\u03b4 , but the\nexponent changes with the wind magnetization: in the HD\ncase we find \u03b4 = 13/10, as predicted by Eq. 23 for K\u0307 = 0\nand \u03b1 = 6/5, while the value of \u03b4 increases to 1.38 and 1.43\nin the cases with \u03c3 = 0.0016 and \u03c3 = 0.003 respectively.\nThe evolution of the termination shock radius is very well\ndescribed in these cases by Eq. 19 for the proper value of\nthe magnetization.\nWe have verified that, when computing the appropriate\nEC model for comparison, using the value of Vts derived\nfrom the simulations, or that obtained from the solution\nof Eq. 19, does not improve substantially the result with\nrespect to using Eq. 22 for given values of Rcd , Vcd and Rts .\nA general advantage that Eq. 22 offers is that it allows one\nto estimate Vts from quantities that can all be measured\ndirectly, at least in principle.\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the radial profiles of density\nand pressure (both thermal and magnetic) derived from\nthe simulations with those computed based on EC. The\nagreement of the EC profiles with our results is extremely\ngood and fails (see the pressure profile) only near the outer\nboundary of the nebula. This is a consequence of the selfsimilarity imposed in the EC model which leads to an\nunphysical singularity at the border.\nWe want to point out some differences between the\nEC and KC models which lead us to conclude that the\nEC model is better suited as the basis for a comparison\nwith the numerical results presented here. First of all, the\nEC model reproduces the positive pressure gradient in the\npost-shock region observed in the simulations (the pressure initially increases up to a value that is about 20-25 %\nlarger than that immediately behind the shock), while\nin KC the pressure is always monotonically decreasing.\n\n\fN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\n7\n\nFig. 3. Evolution with time for the n = 3 case of the\nposition of the contact discontinuity (solid line) and of the\ntermination shock for the hydrodynamics (dotted line),\nthe \u03c3 = 0.0016 (dashed line) and the \u03c3 = 0.003 (dashdotted line) cases. Now the evolution of the termination\nshock cannot be described as a power law in time.\nfrom observations. However, the values R(v = Vcd )/Rts for\nthe EC model are lower than the values Rcd /Rts in our\nsimulations, and the discrepancy increases with \u03c3 (Fig. 7).\nThis discrepancy is most likely a consequence of the\nchanging boundary speed and is enhanced when the contact discontinuity moves with a velocity close to Vasy .\nThis is why in the HD case, when Vasy = 0 (and hence\nVcd /Vasy \u226b 1) the difference is very small. On the other\nhand, we see in Fig. 7 that, if instead of matching the\nvelocities, we consider the size of the nebula in the EC\nmodel as the radius at which the EC solution has a singularity, we observe a much better agreement. Still some\ndiscrepancy remains in the magnetic cases but now it is\nwell below 10 %.\n\nFig. 2. Comparison of the results with EC (solid line) for\nthe no spin-down case at t=1500 yr. Density, thermal pressure and magnetic pressure are shown for all the magnetization we have considered: \u03c3 = 0.003 (dotted line),\n\u03c3 = 0.0016 (dashed line), \u03c3 = 0 (dash-dotted line). The\ntotal pressure at the border is the same in the various\ncases. We want to stress the the radius of the contact discontinuity is about 3-4% greater that the position where\nthe density jump starts. This explain differences with respect to Fig. 7.\n\nMoreover EC gives a larger flow speed in the asymptotic\nregion than KC, in better agreement with the simulation\nresults.\nHowever, the comparison with the EC model is less\nsatisfactory if we consider the size of the nebula. In comparing the model with observations, the standard way to\nestimate the magnetization parameter is as follows: one\nfinds the appropriate \u03c3 so that the theoretical fluid speed\nat a distance from the shock corresponding to the observed value of Rcd matches the boundary speed derived\n\n4.2. Cases with spin-down\nLet us now turn our attention to the main assumption\nunderlying the EC solution, i.e. that of a constant pulsar\nluminosity. As previously noted (Bucciantini et al. 2003),\nthe spin-down process has the effect of reducing the ram\npressure in the wind and, as a consequence, we expect\nto find a ratio Rcd /Rts greater than in the case with no\nspin-down.\nWhen the effects of the pulsar spin-down are included,\nthe evolution of Rcd (t) can no longer be described in terms\nof a fixed power law in time. Despite this, we find that\nthe variation of the exponent is small enough that we can\ncontinue to approximate it as a constant whose value, as\nderived from the simulations, is found to be slightly less\n(\u223c 1.13 \u2212 1.1) than in the case n = 0. A correct description of the time-evolution of Rcd can still be derived as\ndiscussed in Section 2. Eq. 11 with the appropriate values of the coefficients ci , as reported in Table 1, is found\nto provide a very good approximation for Rcd (t) within\nthe uncertainties discussed in the same session. The same\nis true for Rts (t): this can be computed as described in\nSection 2 with an accuracy of order 10-15 %, with the\n\n\f8\n\nN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\nFig. 4. Comparison of the results with EC (solid line) for\nthe n = 2 case at t=1500 yr. Density , thermal pressure and magnetic pressure are shown for all the magnetizations we have considered: \u03c3 = 0.003 (dotted line),\n\u03c3 = 0.0016 (dashed line), \u03c3 = 0 (dash-dotted line). The\ntotal pressure at the border is the same in the various\ncases. Comments are the same as for Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 5. Comparison of the results with EC (solid line)for\nthe n = 3 case at t=1500 yr. Density, thermal pressure and\nmagnetic pressure are shown for all the magnetizations\nwe have considered: \u03c3 = 0.003 (dotted line), \u03c3 = 0.0016\n(dashed line), \u03c3 = 0 (dash-dotted line). The total pressure\nat the border is the same in the various cases. Comments\nare the same as for Fig. 2.\n\nerror increasing with increasing n and \u03c3. The reason for\nthis can be easily understood: our approach for the computation of Rts (t) is based on the assumption that the\nevolution of the nebula proceeds slowly. This becomes an\nincreasingly bad approximation as n and \u03c3 increase.\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 we plot the results of our simulations in\nthe case n = 2 and n = 3 for all the different values of \u03c3 we\nadopted. A comparison is made between the profiles that\nresult from our simulations and those computed based on\nthe EC model for the same wind magnetization. The value\nof Vts needed to compute the appropriate EC solution is\nderived again from Eq. 22. Actually, our simulations give\na generally lower value of Vts . Moreover this decreases as\n\nthe ram pressure drops, eventually becoming negative (the\nshock starts collapsing back to the pulsar in the case with\n\u03c3 = 0.003, n = 3 in Fig. 3). However, the comparisons in\nFigs. 4 and 5 are not improved by using the exact values\nof Vts given by the simulations.\nAgain we find that the self-similar model gives a reasonably good approximation of the simulation results in\nthe post shock region up to the radius at which the magnetic pressure starts dominating over the thermal pressure, but fails, as could be expected, in the outer layers\nof the nebula. Moreover the singularity of the self-similar\nmodel, identified as the outer radius of the nebula to use\nfor comparison with EC, is well inside the external bound-\n\n\fN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\n9\n\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the results obtained for \u03c3 = 0.003\nand n = 2 and n = 3 at the time when the pulsar luminosity is the same. Despite the different conditions, the various profiles coincide almost completely before the maximum of the magnetic pressure, and deviations appear only\nin the outer layer of the nebula. This suggests that the internal structure of a PWN is much more affected by the\ninstantaneous properties of the wind, rather than by the\noverall pulsar history. Therefore, the appearance of the\ninner region of the PWN could in principle be used to estimate the value of \u03c3 from non-thermal emission, without\nsensitivity to the spin-down process. Once the magnetization of the wind is known, the ratio Rcd /Rts could be\nused to infer the effect of spin-down (and eventually to\ndetermine n and \u03c4 ).\n\n4.3. Spin-down factorization\n\nFig. 6. Comparison of the results in the n = 2 case at\nt=1500 yr (dashed line) and in the case n = 3 case at\nt=760 yr (dotted line). The quantity \u03c1u that appears in\nthe label of the y-axis is the density upstream of the termination shock. Radial distances are normalized to the\ntermination shock radius. In the different panels we show,\nfrom top to bottom, the density, thermal pressure and\nmagnetic pressure profiles. In all cases \u03c3 = 0.003. The\nsolid line represents the EC model. \u03b3 = 100.\n\nary as determined from the simulations. The outer part of\nthe nebula shows also a positive velocity gradient. This\nis the effect of the extra energy in the outer layer: this\nlayer was created when the pulsar was more energetic and\ncarries more energy than it would if the pulsar luminosity had stayed constant, so that it tends to expand and\ncauses the material more recently injected by the wind to\nbe confined at smaller radii. The radius of the EC singularity corresponds, within a 10 % uncertainty, to the point\nwhere the speed of the flow is at its minimum.\n\nIn Fig. 7 the evolution of the ratio Rcd /Rts is shown for\nthe various values of \u03c3 and n employed. Neglecting the\nspin-down effect may lead to considerable errors in the\ndescription of the PWN, even for ages comparable or less\nthan the characteristic spin-down time.\nWe want to stress that the ratio Rcd /Rts plays an\nimportant role, being commonly used to infer the wind\nmagnetization and from this the PWN properties. If the\neffects of the spin-down are not taken into account, the\nmagnetization of the wind is overestimated, and the profiles derived for the dynamically important quantities may\nbe wrong.\nIf the value of the magnetization parameter \u03c3 is not\nknown from independent constraints than the radius of\nthe termination shock, to apply consistently the analytic\nmodel described in Section 2 the values of Rcd and Rts\nmust be known at two different times, in order to fix both\nthe normalization and \u03c3 (see end of Section 2). However\nin Subsection 4.2 we have verified that the EC model provides a good description for Rcd /Rts in the case n = 0\nor equivalently t \u226a \u03c4 . One can then use the result of the\nEC model to make up for the lack of observations over\nlong time lapses. Thus the problem of evaluating \u03c3 and\nthe termination shock evolution could be reduced to an\neigenvalue problem to be solved iteratively.\nFrom our simulations (see Fig. 7) we find that the best\nfit for the ratio Rcd /Rts is obtained multiplying the value\ngiven by EC (with Vts given in Eq. 22) by\nCo\n\n\u0012\n\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )n \u2212 (1 + t/\u03c4 )\n(n \u2212 1)t/\u03c4\n\n\u00130.17+33 \u03c3\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nCo compensates for small differences that are present even\nin the case n = 0, and its values are: Co = 1.04 in the HD\ncase, and 1.06 and 1.07 for \u03c3 = 0.0016 and \u03c3 = 0.003\nrespectively. Notice that the effects of the magnetization\nare summarized in the exponent. It is possible in principle\nto use this equation together with Eq. 22 to estimate either\n\u03c3 if n and \u03c4 are known, or the spin-down parameters if\nthe magnetization is independently known (for example\n\n\f10\n\nN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\nNeglecting adiabatic losses, the formula obtained for\na generic n is in shape similar to Eq. 24, but with an\nexponent 0.5. Moreover Eq. 24 will be valid only for small\nvalues of \u03c3 given the fact that the exponent cannot exceed\nthe value 0.5 (no adiabatic losses). More generally as \u03c3\nincreases the value of the exponent will tend to 0.5.\n\n4.4. The Crab Nebula\nAs a special case we shall consider the Crab Nebula. This\nis surely the best studied PWN: a wealth of information is\navailable but still no answer has been given to a number\nof problems.\nWe want to point out that 1D models are an oversimplification in general. More so for the Crab Nebula,\nwhere very clear axisymmetry is observed in the X-rays\n(the renowned jet-torus structure). This has suggested\nthat important deviations from the spherically symmetric approximation might occur in the pulsar wind region,\nleading to the formation of a turbulent flow in the nebula\n(e.g. Komissarov & Lyubarsky 2003).\nIn modeling the Crab Nebula, one important parameter is the actual value of the contact discontinuity velocity; recent estimates (Fesen et al. 1997;\nSankrit & Hester 1997; Sollerman et al. 2000) give the\nvalue 1500 km/s with an upper limit of 2000 km/s. If\nwe use the EC model without spin-down with the prescription in Eq. 22 we find that, in order to end up at the\npresent time with a nebula that has Rcd /Rts = 20, a wind\nwith \u03c3 = 0.0009 or \u03c3 = 0.0015 is required, depending\non whether Vcd = 1500km/s or Vcd = 2000km/s is used.\nTo include the effects of the spin-down, we use the following values: \u03c4 = 720 yr, n = 2.318 (Camilo et al. 2000;\nLyne et al. 1993; Lyne & Manchester 1988). Using these\nvalues and the correction form given in Eq. 24, we find for\nthe magnetization of the Crab wind the value \u03c3 = 0.0004,\nor, if the upper value of the expansion speed is used,\n\u03c3 = 0.0009.\nWe emphasize that these should be taken as estimates\nof the magnetization of the equatorial part of the outflow\nfrom the Crab pulsar, rather than being interpreted as\nreliable estimates of the overall magnetization of the Crab\npulsar wind.\nFig. 7. Evolution of the PWN size, in units of the termination shock radius. The upper three panels refer to the\nHD case, the middle three to \u03c3 = 0.0016, and the lower\nthree to \u03c3 = 0.003. In each panel, the points refer to the\nresult of our simulation; the dotted line is obtained using\nthe value given by EC for the radius at which v = Vcd ;\nthe dashed line is the total size of the nebula in the EC\nmodel; the dot-dashed line is the fit done according to the\ncorrection in Eq. 24; the solid line, finally, represents the\nsolution of Eq. 19 normalized to the numerical results at\ntime t = 50 yr.\nfrom the comparison of synchrotron and Inverse Compton\nemission).\n\n5. Conclusions\nOur results show that, in the spherically symmetric approximation, the EC model gives a good description of the\ninternal profiles of PWNe when the effects of spin-down\ncan be neglected (i.e. when the central object is young and\nnot very powerful). Noticeable discrepancies arise only at\nthe outer boundary of the nebula, where the initial conditions and the evolutionary history of the system both\nplay a major role. However, the region just behind the\ntermination shock and further out, up to the position of\nthe equipartition point, is well reproduced. This is the region of the nebula from which the high energy emission\noriginates.\n\n\fN. Bucciantini et al.: The effects of spin-down on the structure and evolution of PWNe\n\nEven if the radial profiles of the various quantities are\nin good agreement, the ratio Rcd /Rts inferred from the EC\nmodel by matching the boundary velocity for a given \u03c3 is\ngenerally underestimated, due to the discrepancies at the\nboundary. Hence, if the ratio Rcd /Rts estimated in this\nway is compared with the observed value to evaluate the\nwind magnetization, one generally overestimates the value\nof \u03c3. A better agreement is obtained if Rcd is taken equal\nto the radius at which the singularity of the EC model is\nfound.\nThere is a good agreement in the HD case while a small\ndifference, less than 10%, is found in the magnetized cases,\nprobably because in these cases Vcd \u223c Vasy . The EC model\ncan be adapted to the evolution of Vcd since, with respect\nto the sound speed crossing time in the PWN, variations at\nthe border are very slow: changes of Vcd are compensated\nby analogous variations of Vts .\nMore generally, we expect that deviations from the\nspherically symmetric approximation might occur in the\npulsar wind region, leading to the formation of a turbulent flow in the nebula that only multidimensional simulations can handle. In spite of being a simplification of the\nproblem, 1D models can help understanding the importance of various processes like spin-down, mass loading or\nsynchrotron losses, and to clarify how to keep them into\naccount when comparing models with observations.\nOnce the spin-down is included, the ratio Rcd /Rts\nincreases with respect to the constant luminosity case.\nAgain, if this effect is not taken into account, the pulsar\nwind magnetization inferred from the PWN size might\nwell be overestimated. With a simplified analytic model\nwe are able to reasonably reproduce the ratio Rcd /Rts\ngiven by the simulations. We also found a fit to the results of our simulations in the form of a correction coefficient that should multiply the standard EC expectation.\nHowever, the radial profiles of the various quantities given\nby the EC model fail to reproduce the structure inside the\nPWN beyond the point where magnetic pressure reaches\nits maximum.\nGiven our fit, if the wind magnetization is known from\nthe analysis of the non-thermal emission of the PWN, the\nsize of the nebula can be used, in principle, to estimate\nn and \u03c4 . Viceversa, if the pulsar spin-down properties are\nknown, from the same expression it is possible to estimate\n\u03c3.\nAs shown in the case of the Crab Nebula, inclusion\nof the spin-down effect reduces the estimated \u03c3 by about\none order of magnitude with respect to the value found\nby KC. We want to stress that this is not just a dynamical problem related to the size of the nebula alone. A\nless magnetized wind creates a less magnetized nebula.\nSynchrotron losses are less efficient and high energy particles have a longer life and can move farther from the\ntermination shock. This suggests that the interpretation\nof synchrotron maps should take into account the new results we have presented.\n\n11\n\nAcknowledgements.
