INTRODUCTION\nThe\nshort-period,\ndouble\u2013radio pulsar\nsystem\nPSR J0737\u22123039 (Burgay et al. 2003; Lyne et al. 2004),\nbesides being of paramount interest as a probe for theories\nof strong field gravity (Kramer et al. 2006), represents a\nunique laboratory for studies in several fields, ranging from\nthe equation of state of super-dense matter to magnetohydrodynamics. The system is observed nearly edge-on and\nconsists of a fast, recycled radio pulsar (PSR J0737\u22123039A\n[PSR A], period P = 22.7 ms) orbiting its slower companion\n(PSR J0737\u22123039B [PSR B], P = 2.77 s) with an orbital\nperiod of only 2.4 hr. Radio observations of the two pulsars\npermit one to derive a wealth of information which is not\navailable for other neutron stars. These obviously include\nthe neutron star masses and all the other geometrical and\ndynamical parameters of the system, but also information\non the structure and physical properties of the two magnetospheres. The double-pulsar is rich in observational\nphenomena, including a short radio eclipse of A by B\nand orbital modulation of the radio flux of B due to the\ninfluence of A (Lyne et al. 2004). The individual pulses\nfrom B show drifting features due to the impact of the\nlow-frequency electromagnetic wave in the relativistic wind\nfrom A (McLaughlin et al. 2004b), while the eclipse of A\nis modulated at half the rotational period of B (McLaughlin\net al. 2004c). High-energy observations are an important\ncomplement to these studies, in particular for what concerns\nthe physics of the magnetospheric emission and dissipative\nElectronic address: alberto@iasf-milano.inaf.it\n1 Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member\nStates and NASA\n2 IUSS - Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori, viale Lungo Ticino\nSforza 56, 27100 Pavia, Italy\n3 Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Dipartimento di Fisica Nucleare e Teorica, via A.

Because of the\ninteraction of the relativistic wind of the fast spinning pulA = 5.8 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 ) with the magnetosphere of\nsar A (\u0116rot\nB = 1.6 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 ),\nits much less energetic companion (\u0116rot\nthe formation of a bow shock, likely emitting at high energies,\nis expected. The predicted fluxes are roughly comparable to\nthose observed for magnetospheric and/or surface emission\nfrom the pulsars. A termination shock between the two pulsars can probe the properties of a pulsar's relativistic wind at a\nsmaller distance from the central engine than ever studied before. In addition, detection of an orbital phase dependence in\nthe X-ray emission might be expected (Lyutikov 2004; Arons\n& Tavani 1993). Such variability could constrain the geometry of the emission site, thus providing new insights into the\nwind physics close to the pulsar. Alternatively, most of the\nhigh-energy emission could arise from the shock generated\nwhen one or both the pulsar winds interact with the interstellar medium (Granot & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2004).\nThe first X-ray observation of PSR J0737\u22123039, a short (10\nks) Chandra pointing (McLaughlin et al. 2004a) yielded only\n2\n\u223c80 photons. The low X-ray luminosity (LX = 2 \u00d7 1030d0.5\n\u22121\nerg s , where we indicate with dN the distance in units of N\nkpc) corresponds roughly to the entire spin-down luminosity\nof the slow pulsar B and to only a small fraction of that of\npulsar A. The Chandra data of this pioneer observation could\nonly poorly constrain the source spectrum, which appeared\nquite soft, and cannot provide significant evidence for variability, due to the small statistics and time resolution being\ninsufficient to look for the spin periods of the two pulsars.\nA longer public observation (50 ks), carried out in 2004\nMarch through the XMM-Newton Director's Discretionary\nTime program, yielded an improvement in statistics by a factor \u223c10 with respect to the first look of Chandra. These data\n\n\f2\n\nA. Pellizzoni et al.\n\nconfirmed the softness of the spectrum, which could be fit\neither by a power law with photon index \u0393 = 3.5+0.5\n\u22120.3 and ab20\n\u22122\nsorption NH \u2243 7.0 \u00d7 10 cm or by a blackbody with temperature of 0.15 keV and a lower interstellar absorption (Pellizzoni et al. 2004). These authors could also have performed\nthe first X-ray timing analysis for PSR J0737\u22123039, but no\nperiodic or aperiodic variations were found, with upper limits\nof \u223c60% on the pulsed fractions of both pulsars and of \u223c40%\nfor modulations in the orbital period (all limits are at the 99%\nconfidence level and for sinusoidal light curves). Campana\net al. (2004) reported a joint spectral analysis of the XMMNewton (only the MOS) and Chandra data, reaching similar\nconclusions on the source spectrum.\nA further Chandra observation (\u223c90 ks) with the HighResolution Camera showed X-ray pulses at the period of\nPSR A (Chatterjee et al. 2007), with a double-peaked profile, similar to that observed in radio, and a pulsed fraction\nof \u223c70%. Although purely non thermal emission is consistent with the data, the X-ray pulse morphology of PSR A, in\ncombination with previously reported spectral properties of\nthe X-ray emission, suggests the existence of both non thermal magnetospheric emission and a broad sinusoidal thermal\nemission component from the neutron star surface. No pulsations were detected from pulsar B, nor evidence for orbital\nmodulation. Here we report the results of a \u223c230 ks long Xray observation of PSR J0737\u22123039 obtained within the frame\nof XMM-Newton \"Large Programs\" in 2006 October.\n2. X-RAY OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\nOur observation of PSR J0737\u22123039 was carried out in two\nconsecutive XMM-Newton orbits. The first part of the observation started on 2006, October 26 at 00:28:15 UT and\nlasted 119.8 ks, the second one started on October 28 at\n00:28:37 UT and lasted 114.5 ks. In total, the observation\nallowed the coverage of \u223c26 revolutions of the binary system\n(Porb = 8, 834.535 s). The pn camera (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001) was\noperated in Small Window mode (imaging across a 4\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\nfield of view with a 5.67 ms time resolution) with the medium\noptical filter. The MOS cameras (Turner et al. 2001) were\nalso set in the Small Window mode (yielding a 2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 field\nof view in the central CCD, with a time resolution of 0.3 s)\nwith the medium filter. The data were processed using standard pipeline tasks (emproc and epproc) of the XMM-Newton\nScience Analysis Software version 7.1.0.\nIn view of the faintness of PSR J0737\u22123039 in soft X-rays,\nparticular care in selecting source photons and reducing background contamination is crucial. We used only photons with\npattern 0\u201312 for the MOS cameras, while for the pn we used\npattern 0\u20134 for energies above 0.4 keV and pattern 0 for the\nE < 0.4 keV energy range. Such an event selection allows\none to reduce by a factor \u223c3.5 the background count rate in\nthe 0.15\u20130.4 keV energy range in the pn camera, while leaving almost unchanged the source count rate.\nWe evaluated the optimal selection of source events by\nmaximizing the source signal-to-noise ratio in the 0.15\u201310\nkeV range, as a function of:\nSource extraction region.-We considered different extraction radii in the 10\u2032\u2032 \u201330\u2032\u2032 range; the background was extracted\nin each case from two rectangular regions located at the same\ndistance from the readout node as the source region.\nThreshold for high particle background screening.-The\nobservations are affected by a few short soft proton flares.\nWe extracted a light curve in the 0.15\u201310 keV range with a\n\nTABLE 1\nP HOTON H ARVEST FROM THE XMM-Newton O BSERVATIONS OF\nPSR J0737\u22123039.\n\nOrbit\n\nDetector\n\nTotal\nCountsa\n\nBackground\nfractionb (%)\n\nExposure\ntimec (ks)\n\n1260..........\n1260..........\n1260..........\n1261..........\n1261..........\n1261..........\n\npn\nMOS 1\nMOS 2\npn\nMOS 1\nMOS 2\n\n2483\n652\n750\n2222\n587\n697\n\n24.5\n21.7\n26.1\n23.6\n19.7\n29.5\n\n80.7\n111.5\n112.3\n74.9\n102.9\n103.9\n\nN OTE.-See text for details on data reduction and background screening.\n\na Total number of counts inside the source extraction region.\nb Contribution of background to total number of counts.\nc Good observing time after dead-time correction and screening for soft-\n\nproton flares.\n\n10 s time bin from the whole field of view for each camera.\nFollowing the prescription by De Luca & Molendi (2004),\nwe identified the quiescent average count rate and considered\ndifferent thresholds in the 2\u20138 \u03c3 range from this average rate.\nThe optimal choice turned out to be a source extraction radius of 18\u2032\u2032 for the pn and the MOS 1 cameras and of 15\u2032\u2032\nfor the MOS 2 camera (which has a higher low-energy background) and a threshold at 5 \u03c3 from the quiescent rate to\nscreen from high particle background episodes. The resulting\nsource and background count statistics are shown in Table 1.\n3. TIMING ANALYSIS\n\n3.1. Pulsations from PSR J0737\u22123039A\nFor the search of pulsations at the spin period of pulsar\nA we could only use the pn data (\u223c4700 counts), owing to\nthe inadequate time resolution of the MOS data. The times\nof arrival were converted to the solar system barycenter and\ncorrected for the orbital motion and relativistic effects of the\nbinary system according to Blandford & Teukolsky (1976).\nThis was done with a program we wrote ad hoc and tested\nusing an XMM-Newton observation of the binary millisecond pulsar XTE J1751\u2212305 (Miller et al. 2003). As a further\ncross-check, we also compared the rotational phases obtained\nby our program with those resulting from the Tempo timing\nanalysis software.5 The maximum discrepancy between timing corrections from our program and Tempo is at most a few\nmicroseconds.\nIn our search for pulsations we employed the Zn2 test (Buccheri et al. 1983), where we indicate with n the number\nof harmonics. We examined a wide frequency range centered on the value predicted at the epoch (MJD 54 034) of\nour XMM-Newton observation by the radio measurements of\nKramer et al. (2006). The most significant Zn2 statistics occurred for n = 1 at PAbest = 22.6993787(5) ms (1 \u03c3 errors in\nthe last digit are quoted in parentheses). The corresponding Z12 value is 378.91, which even when taking into account\nthe \u223c104 searched periods, has a virtually null probability of\nchance occurrence. Our best-fit period is consistent with the\nvalue PAradio = 22.699378466112(5) ms expected from the radio ephemeris of Kramer et al. (2006).\nThe background-subtracted and exposure-corrected light\ncurve of pulsar A in the 0.15\u20134 keV energy range is shown in\nthe top panel of Figure 1 (due to the soft pulsar spectrum, the\n5\n\nSee http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo.\n\n\fPSR J0737\u22123039: Interacting Pulsars in X-rays\n\nF IG . 1.- Background-subtracted pn light curve of PSR A in the 0.15\u2013\n4 keV energy range folded at period PAbest = 22.6993787(5) ms (top) and\ncorresponding hardness ratio curve based on the soft (0.15\u20130.3 keV) and hard\n(0.8\u20133 keV) energy ranges (bottom).

Error bars are\ncalculated according to the expression \u03c3i = (Ci + Bi f 2 )1/2 /Ei ,\nwhere Ci , Bi and Ei are respectively the total counts, background counts, and exposure in the bin i, and f is the ratio between the source and background extraction area ( f \u2243\n0.11). We checked that the pulsations are significantly detected down to the lowest energy bins covered by the pn instrument; in fact, the Pearson statistics for a 10 bin light curve\nin the 0.15\u20130.2 keV range gives a reduced \u03c72 (hereafter \u03c72r )\nof 3.85, corresponding to a 4 \u03c3 detection.\nThe pulse profile is double peaked and deeply modulated,\nwith a pulsed fraction of 75.7% \u00b1 5.4% in the energy range\n0.15\u20134 keV. To calculate the pulsed flux, we considered\nall the counts above the minimum of the light curve, using the expression PF \u2261 Ctot \u2212 nNmin and its associated error \u03c3PF = (Ctot + n2 \u03c3N2 min )1/2 \u2243 n(Nmin )1/2 , where Ctot are\nthe total counts, n is the number of bins in the light curve\nand Nmin are the counts of the minimum. The expression\n(Cmax \u2212 Cmin )/(Cmax + Cmin ) used by Chatterjee et al. (2007)\ndoes not account for the pulsed flux associated with secondary\npeaks; nevertheless their pulsed fraction value is in agreement\nwith our result within 1 \u03c3. Both methods are \"bin dependent,\" but reasonable different choices of the number of bins\n(i.e. n > 10) do not significantly affect the results. Note that\n\n3\n\nthe pulsed fraction upper limit of 60% obtained in the short\n2004 XMM-Newton observation referred to a sinusoidal profile (Pellizzoni et al. 2004), and therefore it is not inconsistent\nwith the present result.\nA simple hardness ratio analysis, based on the soft (S: 0.15\u2013\n0.3 keV) and hard (H: 0.8\u20133 keV) energy ranges,6 indicates\na softer spectrum in correspondence to the minimum in the\nfolded light curve (see bottom panel of Figure 1). To investigate the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction in more\ndetail and as a cross-check of complementary phase-resolved\nspectral studies discussed below, we produced the folded light\ncurves for four different energy ranges (0.15\u20130.3 keV, 0.3\u20130.5\nkeV, 0.5\u20130.8 keV, and 0.8\u20133 keV) providing 800\u2013900 source\ncounts each (Figure 2). The corresponding pulsed fractions,\nplotted in Figure 3, increase from 50% to 90% from lower to\nhigher energies. These values have a probability smaller than\n1% of deriving from an energy-independent distribution.\nWe searched for possible flux and pulse profile variations\ndue to the pulsars' mutual interaction as a function of the orbital phase. For example, if there is a bow shock structure\nas that described in Lyutikov (2005), associated with an unpulsed variable component (see \u00a7 5), we would expect variations in the total flux correlated with changes in the pulsed\nfraction. In Figure 4 (top) we report the pulsed fraction and\ntotal flux obtained from the folded 0.15\u20133 keV light curves\nintegrated in four orbital phase intervals. The pulsed fraction\nvaries in the 50%\u201380% range with the minimum corresponding to the superior conjunction of A (when A is occulted by\nB; dotted line). However, the values are consistent at the 5.5%\nlevel with a uniform distribution and there is no corresponding change in the total flux. A similar analysis dividing the\norbit in eight parts (Figure 4, bottom) gave only marginal evidence of a \u223c15% variability (null hypothesis probability null\nhypothesis probability = 1.5%) in the pn flux.\nTo calculate upper limits on orbital flux modulation, we\nconsidered the fraction of the counts above the minimum of\nthe light curve with error evaluation similar to those described\nin this subsection. For time scales of \u223c15 min (10 bins) the\n1 \u03c3 upper limits on variability (pn+MOS data) is of 11.5% for\nthe 0.15\u20134 keV range and <20%\u201330% for the selected bands\nmentioned above. Longer time-scales of 0.5\u20131 hr imply upper\nlimits 610% on all energy selections. The search for orbital\nand aperiodic variability, even when selecting the time intervals corresponding to the minimum in the PSR A folded light\ncurve, does not improve the above upper limits.\n3.2. Pulsations from PSR J0737\u22123039B\nWe searched for pulsations from PSR B using the same\nmethod and radio ephemeris reference as for PSR A (Kramer\net al. 2006), but in this case, owing to the longer pulse period, we could also use the lower time resolution MOS data.\nThe expected pulsar period at the epoch of our observation\nis PBradio = 2.7734607024(7) s, with an uncertainty orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the intrinsic pulse search resolution\nof our data set, 21 PB2 /TOBS \u2243 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 s. Thus, if the rotational parameters of the neutron star are stable (as suggested\nby radio ephemeris), a single-trial pulse search at PB is appropriate. However, since we cannot in principle exclude that\n(unlikely) glitches and/or significant timing noise occurred in\nthe time between the radio and X-rays observations, we also\n6 The hardness ratio is defined as (H \u2212 S)/(H + S), where for each phase\nbin H and S are the background-subtracted count rates in the hard and soft\nranges.\n\n\f4\n\nA.

In\nany case, no significant pulsations were detected in the whole\nenergy range nor in our canonical bands (0.15\u20130.3 keV, 0.3\u2013\n0.5 keV, 0.5\u20130.8 keV, and 0.8\u20133 keV) providing 1200\u20131400\nsource counts each. The upper limit on the pulsed flux fraction is of 40%.\nSince the radio flux of PSR B is strongly modulated as a\nfunction of the orbital phase and is nearly disappearing for\nmost of the orbit (Lyne et al. 2004; Burgay et al. 2005),\n\nwe also performed an orbital phase-dependent pulse search.\nWe folded the counts at PBradio for four orbital phase intervals around the pulsars' conjunctions (\u2206\u03c6 = [0.16\u20130.41] and\n[0.66\u20130.91]) and quadratures (\u2206\u03c6 = [0.41\u20130.66] and [0.91\u2013\n1.16]). As a reference, consider that orbital phase 0.28 corresponds to the superior conjunction of A. A positive detection\nof the PSR B pulsations in the pn data set is obtained for the\nphase interval corresponding to the ascending quadrature of B\n(\u2206\u03c6 = [0.41\u20130.66]). The Pearson statistics for the pulse histogram with 20 bins (\u223c250 mean source counts per bin) in the\n0.15\u20133 keV band provides a \u03c72r of 2.4 (19 degrees of freedom\n[dof]) corresponding to a probability of only 0.06% that the\nprofile is drawn from a uniform distribution (3.4 \u03c3). A further analysis with the Zn2 test supports the detection; with the\nnumber of harmonics n being varied from 1 to 5, we found a\nstatistically significant signal for n = 4 (Z42 = 34.55, 4.2 \u03c3) and\n5 (Z52 = 35.48, 3.8 \u03c3). No significant detections are obtained\nfor the other orbital phase intervals (\u03c72r < 1.4, 19 dof).\nWe tried to better constrain the orbital phase interval corresponding to a positive detection of PSR B by shifting and/or\nshortening the orbital phase intervals of the period search.\nHowever we did not find more significant detections, and\nconsidering the low-statistics pulsed data, we cannot derive\ntighter constraints.\nAs mentioned above, the stability of the timing parameters\nof this neutron star is likely, but not guaranteed. Thus, in principle, a strict single-trial search at the predicted value PBradio\nmight not be the optimal strategy. Furthermore, a blind search\nin period is an important cross-check to claim a robust pulsed\n\n\fPSR J0737\u22123039: Interacting Pulsars in X-rays\n\n5\n\nconsidered are shown in Figure 6. The pulse profile appears\nhighly structured and with a pulsed flux fraction of 35 \u00b1 15%\nin the energy range 0.15\u20133 keV.\nThe detection of PSR B in MOS data is only marginal, and\nthe analysis of merged MOS and pn data does not provide better detection significance (even when selecting counts which\nare in the lowest emission bins of the pulse profile of PSR A),\nprobably because the 0.3 s time resolution of the MOS dilutes\nthe sharp peaks of the light curve. Furthermore, the poor effective area of the MOS at low energies (i.e. negligible in\nthe 0.15\u20130.3 keV band) is not efficient for pulse searches in\nsources with very soft spectra. In fact, although PSR B is also\nmarginally detected at E > 0.5 keV (\u03c72r = 2.1, 19 dof), most\nof the flux contributions to the main peaks of its light curve\ncome from the low-energy band.\nIn the hypothesis that PSR B is emitting X-rays only in the\norbital phases in which we can firmly claim pulse detection,\nan orbital flux variability with magnitude comparable with\nthe pulsed flux fraction should be present. In fact, there is\nmarginal evidence that the pn total flux peaks around \u03c6 \u223c 0.5\nwhen B's pulses appear (Figure 4). It is worth noting that\nthe sum of the pulsed emission of the two pulsars roughly accounts for the whole X-ray flux, not allowing for a significant\namount of emission from other sources (e.g. shock emission\nfrom the pulsars' mutual interactions).\n4.

For what concerns the pn pattern selection, we used only single events (pattern 0) for the whole\nenergy range in order to reduce the background in the lowest energy channels. We checked that fully consistent results\nwere obtained including double events (pattern 0\u20134).\nEach spectrum was fitted with the XSPEC version 11.3.2\nsoftware package using four models, all modified by photoelectric absorption (phabs model with cross section from\nBalucinska-Church & McCammon 1992 and abundances\nfrom Anders & Grevesse 1989): power law (PL), blackbody (BB), two blackbodies (BBC +BBH ), and power law plus\nblackbody (PL+BB). The best-fit parameters for the pn spectrum and for a simultaneous fit of the pn, MOS 1, and MOS 2\nspectra are reported in Table 2.\nIn contrast with the previous short Chandra and XMMNewton observations (McLaughlin et al. 2004a; Pellizzoni\net al. 2004; Campana et al. 2004), single-component models fail to properly fit the data. A blackbody model is completely ruled out and only a very steep power law provides\na barely acceptable fit (null hypothesis probability = 4%).\nEither a double-blackbody or a power law plus blackbody\nmodel are instead an adequate fit (null hypothesis probability\n> 50%). In the two-component models, the derived column\ndensity is also in better agreement with the value estimated\nfrom the radio pulsars' dispersion measure (NH = 1.5 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 , assuming 1 H for each electron; Campana et al. 2004).\nThe power law photon index in the PL+BB model is still\nvery soft.

DISCUSSION\n\nOur deep XMM-Newton observation of the double-pulsar\nPSR J0737\u22123039 reveals a complex X-ray phenomenology\nthat cannot be simply ascribed to PSR A alone, although it\nis clear that the only significant power plant of the system\n(apart from its strong gravitational potential) is the spin-down\nenergy release of this pulsar.\nWe confirmed deeply modulated pulsed X-ray emission\n\n\u22122 0 2\n\n10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123 0.01\n\u22122 0 2\n\nC\n\nB\n\n\u22122 0 2\n\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\nwith the phase of PSR A, we simultaneously fitted the three\nphase-resolved spectra with the same blackbody plus power\nlaw model with all the parameters linked together, except for\nan overall normalization factor. A globally acceptable fit is\nobtained, but if we compute separately the \u03c72r for each, fixing\nall the parameters to the best-fit values of the simultaneous\nfit, we note that the fit of the off-pulse spectrum is unacceptable (see Table 4). The corresponding residuals (see Figure 7)\nshow a soft excess in the off-pulse spectrum, confirming the\nsoftening in the pulse minimum already displayed in the hardness ratio (see Figure 1).\nWe also tested the possibility that separate physical processes, producing different spectral components, were responsible for the pulsed and unpulsed emission. A first hypothesis,\nalready proposed by Chatterjee et al. (2007), where a blackbody accounts for the unpulsed emission and a power law for\nthe pulsation is immediately discarded by the fact that the offpulse spectrum cannot be well fitted by a single-blackbody\nmodel (see Table 3).\nThe off-pulse spectrum is instead well fitted by twoblackbodies. Therefore we tried to fit the phase-resolved spectra with a three-component model composed of two constant\nblackbodies and a power law with stable photon index and\nvariable normalization. The resulting fit is very good and its\nparameters are shown in Table 4.\nSince a good fit of the off-pulse spectrum is also obtained\nusing a PL+BB model (see Table 3), we also tested a model\nwhere the unpulsed spectrum was composed by a blackbody\nplus a power law and a second blackbody was responsible\nfor the pulsed emission. In this model, the two blackbodies\nmight come from the surface of the two pulsars and the power\nlaw from a shock.

Therefore, this detection gives strong evidence for the\nmutual interactions of the two pulsars also at high energies.\nAlthough, as discussed below, there is no direct evidence of a\ntermination shock between their winds and magnetospheres,\n\n\f8\n\nA.

A double-blackbody (BBC , kB T = 114 eV\nand BBH , kB T = 290 eV) provides a good fit, while a PL+BB\nmodel with a blackbody temperature of kB T = 150 eV and a\nsoft photon index of 3.2 is even better.\nIt is interesting to compare the relative contribution of each\nspectral component to the total flux with the pulsed fraction\nof PSR A in order to test whether the pulsed flux could be ascribed to a specific thermal or non thermal component (or to\na particular combination of them). For the case of the PL+BB\nmodel, the power law component contributes to \u223c76% of the\npn counts in the 0.15\u20134 keV band, a value in perfect agreement with the pulsed fraction of PSR A (75.7 \u00b1 5.4)% in the\nsame energy range. However, the tentative association of\nmost of the non thermal flux in the PL+BB model with the\npulsed flux is ruled out by observing that, in this hypothesis,\nthe steep power law should strongly contribute to the pulsed\nflux especially at low energies, but this is not the case; the\npower law contributes \u223c86% of the counts in the 0.15\u20130.3\nkeV band, a value much higher than the corresponding pulsed\nflux (\u223c50%) as shown by the stars plotted in Figure 3. A\nsimilar argument applies for the case of the double-blackbody\nmodel (see triangles plotted in Figure 3). These results are\nconfirmed by the phase-resolved spectra of PSR A showing\nthat the off-pulse spectrum cannot be well fitted by a singlecomponent model.\nMore generally, none of the double-component best-fit\nmodels are compatible with the plot in Figure 3, even with\nthe assumption that the pulsed flux results from a combination of both spectral components. In fact, the total flux of the\nsofter spectral component (either the power law or the colder\nblackbody) is 3\u20134 times higher than that of the harder component. Therefore, it is impossible to invert the trend in Figure 3 even when assuming that the harder component is fully\npulsed. For example, in the case of the PL+BB model, assuming that the pulsed flux is due to the full blackbody component plus a part of the power law component, it is impossible to obtain a pulsed fraction that is increasing with energy.\nTherefore, the entire X-ray flux of the double-pulsar system\ncannot be interpreted as a simple combination of a non thermal and single-temperature thermal emission from PSR A or\n\nPSR B. Therefore, on the basis of these considerations and of\nthe spectral results of \u00a7 4 we are led to consider models based\non three spectral components.\nThe inclusion of an additional cooler blackbody BBC (possibly related to PSR B) in the PL+BB model can account for\nthe small pulsed fraction at low energy. Three-component\nmodels where blackbody emission (BBH ) is responsible for\nmost of the pulsed emission from PSR A do not provide an\nacceptable spectral fit (see Table 4) and fail to match pulsed\nflux fractions in Figure 3. Assuming instead that most of\nthe pulsed PSR A flux is due to the power law, it is possible to reproduce the trend seen in Figure 3 (squares). This\nis also the best three-component scenario compatible with the\nphase-resolved spectrum of PSR A (see \u00a7 4, Table 4). It is\nworth noting that the phase-resolved spectrum of PSR A does\nnot reveal any variation apart from a significant softening in\nthe off-pulse phases, in agreement with the proposed threecomponent model.\nThe best three-component model fitting phase-resolved\nspectrum of PSR A and pulsed fluxes of both pulsars is thus\ncomposed of a power law with photon index \u0393 \u223c 3.3 and 0.2\u2013\n3 keV luminosity LPL = 1.9 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 , a cooler (\u223c30\neV) blackbody with bolometric luminosity LBBC = 3.0 \u00d7 1031\nerg s\u22121 , and a hotter blackbody (\u223c130 eV) with luminosity LBBH = 5.2 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 . The emission from PSR A is\nmostly non thermal, its luminosity being equal to LPL plus\nthe possible additional smaller contribution of LBBH ; LA \u223c\n2 \u00d7 1030 = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124\u0116A in the 0.2\u20133 keV energy range.\nBecause of the softness of the spectrum, the efficiency of\nthe conversion of rotational energy loss into X-ray luminosity is strongly sensitive to the energy range considered. The\nPSR A luminosity in the 0.1\u201310 keV range matches \u223c10\u22123\u0116A ,\nthe value typically found for recycled radio pulsars that are\ndetected at X-ray energies (Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999). As expected from a mostly magnetospheric emission, pulse peaks\nare still relatively steep and far from thermal broad sinusoidal\npulsations seen in other recycled pulsars with comparable spin\nparameters (Zavlin et al. 2002). Non-thermal deeply modulated components are instead seen in the pulsed flux of the\nmost energetic recycled pulsars (e.g. PSR B1821\u221224). The\npeculiar nature of PSR A is also stressed by the fact that no\nother recycled pulsar with such a steep non thermal emission\ncomponent is known.\nThe observed equivalent emitting radius of BBH is one or-\n\n\fPSR J0737\u22123039: Interacting Pulsars in X-rays\nder of magnitude smaller than the polar cap radius of PSR A\n(\u223c1 km), but modeling with a non-uniform temperature of the\nheated region (Zavlin et al. 2002) or invoking a partially filled\npolar cap (Harding & Muslimov 2002) could solve this discrepancy. Thus, we can interpret BBH as due to the heating\nof A's polar cap from back-flowing particles in its magnetosphere. The light curve of PSR A shows a bridge between the\ntwo peaks 2\u20133 times higher than the off-pulse flux, leading\nto the idea that both non thermal pulses emerge from a wide,\ncenter-filled thermal emission cone from the magnetic pole\npossibly associated to BBH .\n5.1. The nature of PSR B X-ray emission\nWe detected PSR B during part of the orbit, around the ascending node. Its 0.2\u20133 keV flux estimated from the pulsed\nlight curve is \u223c1.2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and corresponds to\n(35 \u00b1 15)% of the total flux in the orbital phase interval 0.44\u2013\n0.61. The corresponding luminosity of 3.6 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 represents \u223c20% of the spin-down energy loss, a value much\nhigher than observed in all the other normal pulsars (Possenti\net al. 2002).\nThe PSR B emission is likely associated to the cooler blackbody emission BBC (kB T \u2243 30 eV), with the possible addition of the weaker and hotter component BBH (if the latter\nis not associated to PSR A). In this case, the bolometric luminosity of PSR B can be calculated as LB \u2243 4 \u00d7 LBBC \u2243\n1.2 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 assuming it is emitted during one-fourth\nof the orbit (LBBC and LBBH are orbital phase-averaged luminosities). This luminosity is surprisingly much higher than the\nX-ray emission from PSR A (assuming LA \u2243 LPL = 1.9 \u00d7 1030\nerg s\u22121 ). Obviously, X-ray emission from PSR B can only\nbe powered by an external source, i.e. the spin-down energy\nfrom PSR A. In this hypothesis, \u223c2% of the rotational energy\nloss of PSR A is converted into thermal radiation from PSR B.\nZhang & Loeb (2004) explain the strong brightening of\npulsed radio flux from PSR B in two portions of the orbit as\nepisodes during which pairs from PSR A's wind flow into the\nopen field line region of pulsar B and emit curvature radiation at radio frequencies within an altitude of \u223c108 cm. Once\npairs from A's wind leak into B's magnetosphere, they will\nstream all the way down, heating the surface of B, giving\nrise to thermal radiation. According to this model, the predicted X-ray luminosity is LX,B \u223c 2 \u00d7 1031\u03b7 (\u2206\u03a9w,A /4\u03c0)\u22121\nerg s\u22121 , and the typical temperature of the polar cap of PSR B\nis kB Tpc \u223c 0.4 \u03b7 1/4 (\u2206\u03a9w,A /4\u03c0)\u22121/4 keV, where \u03b7 is the fraction of all pairs from A's bow shock injected into B's open\nfield line region and \u2206\u03a9w,A is the unknown solid angle of A's\nwind.\nThe X-ray luminosity predicted by the model is in good\nagreement with our results if we assume that PSR A's wind is\nanisotropic (i.e. \u2206\u03a9w,A . 1 sr), as heuristically suggested by\nthe variable illumination inducing radio and X-ray emission\nof PSR B. Within the above anisotropy assumption, the required efficiency \u03b7 is (poorly) constrained to 650% to match\nthe observed PSR B luminosity.\nHowever, according to this model, PSR B's surface would\nbe heated to a temperature (\u223c500 eV) higher than the observed values of BBC and BBH . This discrepancy could be\ndue to the fact that most of the predicted luminosity (BBC )\ncomes from a region larger than the polar cap and consistent\nwith the whole neutron star's surface. The hotter component\nis consistent in size with the polar cap and could be responsible for the observed pulsations.\n\n9\n\nIn radio, the shape and the intensity of the pulse profile of\nPSR B vary with orbital longitude, with two bright phases\ncentered around longitudes (with respect to the ascending\nnode) of \u223c210\u25e6 (bright phase 1 [bp1], orbital phase 0.11) and\n280\u25e6 (bright phase 2 [bp2], orbital phase 0.31) at the epoch of\nfirst observations (Lyne et al. 2004). Because of the geodetic precession of pulsars' spins and periastron advance, these\nbright phases are shifting to greater longitudes at a rate of\na few deg yr\u22121 (Burgay et al. 2005). At the epoch of our\nXMM-Newton observation, the centroid of the radio bright\nphase bp2 is expected at \u223c300\u25e6 of longitude (orbital phase\n0.36). The brightening of PSR B in X-rays appears in the\norbital phase interval adjacent to (following) bp2 and peaks\naround the ascending node. When PSR A's wind intercepts\nPSR B's magnetosphere, it powers radio emission and it starts\nheating B's surface. The X-ray emission from B lasts for\n30 \u00b1 10 min each orbit (detection significance fades outside\nthis range) constraining the thermal inertial time of the neutron star in good agreement with theoretical expectations for\nexternal heating of a pulsar surface (Eichler & Cheng 1989).\n5.2. Constraints on X-ray emission from a bow shock\nbetween PSR A's wind and PSR B's magnetosphere\nThe short occultation of A by B seen in the radio band\n(Lyne et al. 2004; McLaughlin et al. 2004c,b) could imply\nthe presence of a dense magnetosheath enfolding the magnetosphere of PSR B, although all the absorption could occur\nfrom within the PSR B's magnetosphere alone (Lyutikov &\nThompson 2005). In the magnetosheath model, the relativistic wind from A collides with B's magnetic field at an equilibrium distance from B comparable or smaller than the radius\nof its light cylinder (Arons et al. 2005; Lyutikov 2004). Thus,\nin contrast with termination shocks seen in pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) typically at distances >106 light cylinder radii,\na termination shock between PSR A and PSR B could probe\nthe properties of a pulsar's relativistic wind at a smaller distance from the central engine than ever studied before. PWNe\nare usually strongly radiative at high energies with typical efficiencies LX /\u0116PSR = 10\u22122 to 10\u22123 . Therefore, some trace\nof a peculiar PWN originating from PSR B's magnetic pressure confining the wind outflow from A should be in principle\nfound as a non thermal component in our data.\nAn important issue concerning such a bow\nshock/magnetosheath model is that one might expect a\nflux modulation as a function of the orbital phase owing\nto the changing view of the shock front. In particular, the\nshocked wind is expected to flow away from the head of\nthe bow shock in a direction roughly parallel to the shock\n(Lyutikov 2004; Granot & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2004). This might imply\nrelativistic beaming of the radiation emitted by the shocked\nplasma, resulting in a .50% modulation of the observed\nemission as a function of the orbital phase with possible\npeaks at 90\u25e6 from conjunctions.\nThe upper limits we obtained on the flux variations as a\nfunction of the orbital phase allow us to exclude any significant orbital modulation >15% in X-rays (\u00a7 3.1). Assuming\nthat most of the unpulsed flux of the system (\u223c10%\u201350% of\nthe total flux depending on the selected energy range) could\nbe ascribed to the bow shock, flux variations should have been\ndetected. In fact, the range of allowed spectral slopes of non\nthermal components in our spectral fits is not compatible with\nthe \"canonical\" shock value \u0393 \u223c 2, although a soft post-shock\nspectrum could be explained with the presence of an unusual\nlow-energy relativistic electron population, as required in the\n\n\f10\n\nA. Pellizzoni et al.\n\nmagnetosheath model to provide A and B's eclipses by synchrotron absorption (Arons et al. 2005; Lyutikov 2004). Nevertheless, the off-pulse spectrum of PSR A is not even compatible with a simple non thermal emission, and PSR B would\nfill most of it at least for the part of the orbit in which it is\ndetected. Therefore there is not much room left for a shock\nemission component in our data. An upper limit (90% confidence level) of \u223c1029 erg s\u22121 (0.2\u20133 keV) corresponding to an\nefficiency of Lshock\n/\u0116A = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 can be obtained by evaluX\nating the maximum allowed luminosity of an unpulsed power\nlaw component with photon index \u223c2 in the off-pulse spectrum of PSR A.\nSuch a low output in shock emission compared to typical\nPWN's Lshock\n/\u0116PSR is not surprising looking at the small solid\nX\nangle over which the wind from A is intercepted by B and\nconsidering that the termination shock of the wind is much\ncloser than in known nebulae and that it could show a different\nphenomenology.\nAssuming that the wind energy is radiated isotropically\nfrom PSR A and that it is intercepted by a sphere centered on PSR B with radius equal to its light cylinder Rlc,B ,\nthe resulting shock emission efficiency is Lshock\n/\u0116PSR =\nX\nkR2lc,B /4d 2 f (\u03c3M ), where d is pulsars' separation, f (\u03c3M ) is\nthe fraction of power intercepted by the shock feeding into\nthe accelerated electrons (it is a function of the unknown\nmagnetization parameter \u03c3M ), and k is a normalization factor to fit observed \"standard\" PWNe X-ray efficiencies, where\n\u03c3M \u226a 1. Kennel & Coroniti (1984a,b) provide an extensive\ndiscussion of the shock power function f (\u03c3M ) that is proportional to 1/(\u03c3M )1/2 for \u03c3M \u226b 1 (high-\u03c3M shocks have poor\nefficiency) and is .1 for \u03c3M \u226a 1. Figure 8 shows the resulting Lshock\n/\u0116PSR curve as a function of the magnetization\nX\nparameter \u03c3M accounting for uncertainties (hatched area) associated with the actual size of the region intercepting the\nshock (it could be a factor 5 smaller than Rlc,B according to\npressure balance) and errors on k due to the observed span in\nPWNe efficiencies. For low values of the magnetization parameter, the shock could theoretically account for a significant\nfraction of the X-ray luminosity, but this is not the case; the\nobserved upper limit (dot-dashed line) constrains the magnetization parameter to values &1 and, thus, much higher than\nthose estimated for Crab-like PWNe. Such an high magnetization parameter is apparently inconsistent with the value of\n\u223c0.03 predicted by the magnetosheath model (Arons et al.\n2005), and it seems to confirm most of the modern wind models (Contopoulos & Kazanas 2002; Lyubarsky & Kirk 2001)\npredicting \u03c3M \u226b 1.\nGranot & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2004) proposed a model in which the\nemission from the interaction of the two pulsars is lower than\nthat expected from the interaction of pulsar A's wind alone\nwith the interstellar medium. Thus, PSR A could provide a\n\"standard\" PWN (\u03c3M \u226a 1) at distances of \u223c1015 cm from the\npulsar surface. In this model, little or no modulation with the\norbital periods PA and PB is expected, but even in this case it\nis difficult to account for the steepness of the unpulsed spectrum. Furthermore, the predicted luminosity of this model\nin the energy range (0.2\u201310 keV) is \u223c7 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 , much\nhigher than our upper limit on the shock component discussed\nabove.\n6.

The observed upper limit on\nthe flux of a shock signature emission in our data (dot-dashed line) constrains\n\u03c3M to values >1 (dotted line).\n\npulsed detection in X-ray of the PSR A emission providing\n80% of the total absorbed flux from the system. For the first\ntime, X-ray emission from PSR B is also detected with good\nconfidence (\u223c200\u2013300 pulsed counts) around the ascending\nnode of the orbit.\nA three-component spectral model can satisfactorily fit\nphase-resolved spectra and the energy dependence of the\nPSR A pulsed fraction. The best-fit model is composed of\na soft power law responsible for most of the pulsed emission\nfrom PSR A (accounting for only \u223c15% of the total unabsorbed luminosity at E > 0.1 keV), a cooler (\u223c30 eV) blackbody likely associated to PSR B, and a hotter and fainter thermal component originating from back falling particles heating\npolar caps of either PSR A or PSR B (RBBH \u223c 100 m). Note\nthat the cooler blackbody accounts for most of the bolometric luminosity, even if its contribution in the XMM-Newton\nenergy range is small.\nPSR A shows peculiar properties with respect to other\nknown recycled pulsars (e.g. the softest non thermal spectrum), possibly due to the particular evolutionary history of\na double-neutron star system. The phenomenology of PSR B\nis completely different from that of any other pulsar and the\nonly viable possibility to explain its X-ray emission seems\nthat it is powered by PSR A's wind heating B's surface. Our\nobservation is in good agreement with theoretical predictions\nby models also explaining B's radio flares (Zhang & Loeb\n2004), although a more complex thermal emission scenario\n(colder and non uniform temperature) should be invoked.\nThere are no signs (e.g. orbital flux modulation, a significant non thermal component in PSR A's off-pulse) of the presence of X-ray emission from a bow shock between PSR A's\nwind and PSR B's magnetosphere (Lyutikov 2004; Arons\net al. 2005) invoked to explain the occultation of the radio\nemission of PSR A at the inferior conjunction of PSR B. The\nupper limit on the flux of such a shock component constrains\nthe wind magnetization parameter \u03c3M of PSR A to values >1,\nmuch higher than that predicted by the magnetosheath radio\noccultation of PSR A. The absorption causing A's occultation is likely to occur within B's magnetosphere which retains\nenough plasma to produce an eclipse (Lyutikov & Thompson\n2005).\nFurther X-ray observations of PSR J0737\u22123039 with XMM-\n\n\fPSR J0737\u22123039: Interacting Pulsars in X-rays\nNewton and Chandra with reasonable exposure times (<1\nMs) would not significantly improve PSR B detection or better constrain the pulsar's spectra. At gamma-ray energies,\nthe absence of the strong thermal components seen in Xrays could instead allow one to reveal non thermal emission\nfrom the pulsars' interactions and better constrain the magnetospheric emission from PSR A. The empirical relation between gamma-ray luminosity L\u03b3 and \u0116 for known gamma-ray\npulsars (i.e, L\u03b3 \u221d (\u0116)1/2 , Thompson 2004; Zhang & Harding 2000) yields L\u03b3 ,A \u223c 1033 erg s\u22121 , a value compatible\nwith the luminosity of the possibly related EGRET source\n3EG J0747\u22123412 (Hartman et al. 1999) assuming the same\ndistance. The gamma-ray pulsed emission of PSR A could\nbe detected by the AGILE (Tavani et al. 2006) and GLAST 7\nmissions.\nApart from PSR J0737\u22123039, the only other known\nX-ray-emitting double-neutron star binary (DNSB) is\nPSR J1537+1155 (Kargaltsev et al. 2006). The X-ray spectra of PSR J1537+1155 and PSR J0737\u22123039 are similar, and\ntheir X-ray luminosities are about the same fraction of the\nrespective spin-down energies. We note that, if the other\nDNSBs also have a similar efficiency, no other known object of this class can be detected by the currently available Xray telescopes. Unlike PSR J0737\u22123039, in PSR J1537+1155\n7\n\n11\n\nthe distribution of photon arrival times over the binary orbital\nphase shows a deficit of X-ray emission around apastron, supporting the idea that most of the emission is caused by interaction of the relativistic wind from the pulsar with its neutron\nstar companion. The difference between the two DNSBs can\nbe explained by the smaller eccentricity of PSR J0737\u22123039\nor different alignments between the equatorial plane of the\nmillisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of the binary (Kargaltsev et al. 2006). Despite PSR J1537+1155 being weaker\nthan PSR J0737\u22123039, it may offer better diagnostics to discriminate emission produced by the shocked wind from \"standard\" pulsar magnetospheric and surface emission, and thus,\nit is one of the most interesting systems suitable for further\nX-ray investigations of the inner pulsar magnetospheres and\nwind parameters in compact systems.\n\nWe thank Andrea Possenti for helpful discussions about\nPSR A timing analysis and cross-checks on timing corrections\nfrom our programs and Tempo.
