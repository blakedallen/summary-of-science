Chaput, L. Manivel, N. Perrin\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nAbstract\nWe prove that the quantum cohomology ring of any minuscule or cominuscule homogeneous\nspace, once localized at the quantum parameter, has a non trivial involution mapping Schubert\nclasses to multiples of Schubert classes. This can be stated as a strange duality property for the\nGromov-Witten invariants, which turn out to be very symmetric.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper is a sequel to [CMP], where we began a unified study of the quantum cohomology of\n(co)minuscule homogeneous manifolds. One intriguing feature of quantum cohomology, as already\nobserved by several authors and especially for Grassmannians (see []), is that it is more symmetric\nthat ordinary cohomology.\nIn this paper we show that the main tools introduced in [CMP] allow to state, and prove, a general\nstrange duality statement for the quantum cohomology of a (co)minuscule homogeneous manifold\nX = G/P . Recall that a Z-basis for the ordinary cohomology ring H \u2217 (X) (or for the Chow ring\nA\u2217 (X)) of X is given by the Schubert classes \u03c3(w), where w \u2208 WX belongs to the set of minimal\nlengths representatives of W/WP , the quotient of the Weyl group W of G by the Weyl group WP of P .\nTo be precise, we let \u03c3(w) be the class of the Schubert variety X(wX w), where wX denotes the longest\nelement in WX . So \u03c3(w) has degree l(w) in the Chow ring (and twice this degree in cohomology).\nNote that the map w 7\u2192 p(w) = w0 w, for w \u2208 W/WP \u2243 WX , defines Poincar\u00e9 duality on X. The map\nw 7\u2192 \u03b9(w) = w0P w, where w0P denotes the longest element of WP , will play a crucial role in the sequel.\nFor w = s\u03b11 * * * s\u03b1l(w) a reduced decomposition of w \u2208 WX , we let\nl(w)\n\ny(w) =\n\nY\n\nn\u03b1i (\u03b10 )\u01eb(\u03b1i ) .\n\ni=1\n\nHere \u03b10 denotes the highest root of G, and n\u03b1i (\u03b10 ) is the coefficient of \u03b1i when \u03b10 is written in the\nbasis of simple roots. Moreover, we have let \u01eb(\u03b1) = 1 if \u03b1 is a long root, \u01eb(\u03b1) = \u22121 if \u03b1 is short (in\nthe simply-laced case, all roots are considered long). The rational number y(w) is well defined since\nin the (co)minuscule case, reduced decompositions are uniquely defined up to commutation relations.\nFinally, we let \u03b4(w) be the number of occurences, in a reduced decomposition of w, of the simple root\n\u03b2 that defines P .\nKey words: quantum cohomology, minuscule homogeneous space, quiver, Schubert calculus, strange duality, GromovWitten invariant.\nMathematics Subject Classification: 14M15, 14N35\n\n1\n\n\fThe Schubert classes are still a basis over Z[q] of the (small) quantum Chow ring QA\u2217 (X), whose\nassociative product is defined in terms of 3-points Gromov-Witten invariants. Denote by QA\u2217 (X)loc\nits localization at q, that is,\nQA\u2217 (X)loc = QA\u2217 (X) \u2297Z[q] Z[q, q \u22121 ].\nStrange duality can be stated in a uniform way as follows.\nTheorem 1.1 (Strange Duality) Let X be a minuscule or cominuscule homogeneous space. The\nendomorphism \u03b9 of QA\u2217 (X)loc , defined by\n\u03b9(q) = y(s\u03b10 )q \u22121\n\nand\n\n\u03b9(\u03c3(w)) = q \u2212\u03b4(w) y(w)\u03c3(\u03b9(w)),\n\nis a ring involution.\nThis result can be stated as a symmetry property of the Gromov-Witten invariants, see Corollary\n5.4, which unexpectedly relates certain numbers of small degree rational curves with numbers of high\ndegree rational curves. In fact we will obtain these results by observing that the quantum product\nwith the class of a point maps any Schubert class to another Schubert class, multiplied by some power\nof q, see Theorem 3.3.\nFor Grassmannians these results were first proved by Postnikov [P1]; in this case y(w) = 1 for\nany w. For classical Grassmannians our strange duality statement will be deduced from the quantum\nPieri formulas of [BKT]. For the two exceptional minuscule spaces, we have used the presentations of\nthe quantum Chow rings obtained in [CMP]. The case of the Cayley plane has been checked by hand,\nbut that of the Freudenthal variety required the help of a computer.\nAs a consequence of this theorem, we deduce from the formula for the smallest power of q appearing\nin the quantum product of two Schubert classes, (see [FW] or [CMP]), a formula for the highest power\nof q in such a product (Corollary 5.5). For u and v in WX , let us denote, following W. Fulton and C.\nWoodward [FW], by \u03b4(u, v) the minimal degree of a rational curve meeting two general translates of\nX(u\u2217 ) and X(v \u2217 ) (see also [CMP] page 20 and corollary 4.12 for a combinatorial description).\nTheorem 1.2 For u, v \u2208 WX , the maximal power of q that appears in the quantum product of Schubert\nclasses \u03c3(u) \u2217 \u03c3(v), is\ndmax (u, v) = \u03b4(u) \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b9(u), p(v)) = \u03b4(v) \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b9(v), p(u)).\n\n2\n\nA partition of the Hasse diagram\n\nLet X = G/P be a (co)minuscule homogeneous variety. In [CMP] we defined the perimeter dmax of\nX. For any non negative integer d \u2264 dmax , we introduced certain Schubert subvarieties Td and Yd of\nX, with Td \u2282 Yd\u2217 . These varieties allowed us to define a quantum Poincar\u00e9 duality as follows: for any\nSchubert subvarieties X(u), X(v) \u2282 X, the Gromov-Witten invariant Id (Yd\u2217 , X(u), X(v)) is non zero\nif and only if X(u), X(v) are contained in the (smooth) variety Td , and define Poincar\u00e9 dual classes\nin Td \u2013 in which case the invariant equals one. In particular\nId (Yd\u2217 , {pt}, Td ) = 1.\nOne of the main themes of this paper is to investigate another quantum Poincar\u00e9 type duality, defined\nby the non vanishing of the Gromov-Witten invariants Id ({pt}, X(u), X(v)). Let \u03b4(u) denote the\nmaximal integer d such that X(u) \u2282 Yd\u2217 . The following facts are taken from [CMP] page 20:\n1. There exists a degree d rational curve in X joining the base point e(1) = P/P of X = G/P with\nthe base point e(u) = uP/P \u2208 X(u), if and only if d \u2265 \u03b4(u).\n2\n\n\f2. If \u03b2 is the simple root defining P , \u03b4(u) is the number of occurences of s\u03b2 in a reduced decomposition of u.\n3. \u03b4(u) = \u03b4(wX , u), the minimal length of a Bruhat chain from u to wX , as defined in [FW].\nWe add to this list the following essential property.\nLemma 2.1 We have Td \u2282 X(w) \u2282 Yd\u2217 if and only if d = \u03b4(wX , w).\nProof. We proved in [CMP, corollary 4.12] a combinatorial characterisation of the smallest power\nappearing in a quantum product. This gives \u03b4(wX , w) = min{d / Td \u2282 X(w)}. The lemma will follow\nfrom the fact that for all d \u2264 dmax , we have Td\u22121 6\u2282 Yd\u2217 and the equivalence\nTd\u22121 6\u2282 X(w) \u21d4 X(w) \u2282 Yd\u2217 .\nThese two results come from the following facts on the quivers QYd\u2217 and QTd (cf. [CMP] for definitions\nand results on quivers):\n\u2022 the quiver QYd\u2217 is obtained from the quiver QX by removing all the vertices above the vertex\n(\u03b8(\u03b2), d) where \u03b2 is the simple root defining X and \u03b8 is the Weyl involution\n\u2022 The vertices of QTd\u22121 are those under the vertex (\u03b8(\u03b2), d).\nThe vertex (\u03b8(\u03b2), d) \u2208 QX is in the quiver QTd\u22121 but not in the quiver QYd\u2217 proving that Td\u22121 6\u2282 Yd\u2217 .\nFurthermore, the condition Td\u22121 6\u2282 X(w) is equivalent to the fact that the vertex (\u03b8(\u03b2), d) is not in\nthe quiver of X(w) which is also equivalent to the inclusion X(w) \u2282 Yd\u2217 .\n\u0003\nA nice consequence is that we get a partition of WX in dmax + 1 Bruhat intervals,\nWX =\n\ndG\nmax\n\n[Td , Yd\u2217 ].\n\nd=0\n\nWe will denote by Wd \u2282 WX the interval [Td , Yd\u2217 ]. For example, W1 is the image in W/WP \u2243 WX of\nthe set of reflections s\u03b1 , \u03b1 a root of G. In particular T1 is represented by s\u03b10 .\nRecall that in [CMP], we proved that Gromov-Witten invariants of degreed d on X can be interpreted as classical intersection numbers on an auxiliary variety Fd . This variety Fd is homogeneous\nunder the same group G as X, and there is an incidence diagram\nId\n\npd\n\n/X\n\nqd\n\n\u000f\n\nFd\nThen Zd \u2282 Fd is the (image by qd of the) fiber of pd , and Yd \u2282 X is the (image by pd of the) fiber of\nqd . These varieties are given by the following table.\nX\n\nd\n\nTd\n\nYd\n\nZd\n\nG(p, n)\n\u2264 min(p, n \u2212 p)\nG(p \u2212 d, n \u2212 2d)\nG(d, 2d)\nG(p \u2212 d, p) \u00d7 G(n \u2212 p \u2212 d, n \u2212 p)\nG\u03c9 (n, 2n)\n\u2264n\nG\u03c9 (n \u2212 d, 2n \u2212 2d)\nG\u03c9 (d, 2d)\nG(n \u2212 d, n)\nGQ (n, 2n)\n\u2264 [n/2]\nGQ (n \u2212 2d, 2n \u2212 4d) GQ (2d, 4d)\nG(n \u2212 2d, n)\nOP2\n1\nP5\nP1\nGQ (5, 10)\n8\n2\npt\nQ\nQ8\n10\n1\nE7 /P7\n1\nQ\nP\nOP2\n2\nP1\nQ10\nOP2\n3\npt\nE7 /P7\npt\n3\n\n\fLemma 2.2 For any d \u2264 dmax , the Bruhat interval [Td , Yd\u2217 ] in WX can be identified with the Hasse\ndiagram of a minuscule homogeneous variety Zd .\nProof. For any Schubert subvariety X(w) of X, we denoted by Fd (w)\nb = qd (p\u22121\nd (X(w)) the corresponding Schubert subvariety of Fd . The map w 7\u2192 w\nb identifies the Bruhat interval [Td , Yd\u2217 ] in WX with\nthe Bruhat interval [Zd\u2217 , Fd ] in WFd . By Poincar\u00e9 duality on Fd and Zd , this interval is canonically\nidentified with [pt, Zd ], which coincides with the Hasse diagram of Zd .\n\u0003\nMoreover, each interval Wd , being isomorphic with the Hasse diagram of the smooth homogeneous\nvariety Zd , is endowed with a natural involution induced by Poincar\u00e9 duality on the latter. We\nget a global involution of WX which we denote by \u03b9. In particular \u03b9(Td ) = Yd\u2217 , and the fact that\nId (Yd\u2217 , {pt}, Td ) = 1 implies that for any u \u2208 WX ,\ncodim(X(u)) + codim(X(\u03b9(u))) = \u03b4(u)c1 (X).\n\n3\n\nThe quantum product by the class of a point\n\nIn this section we want to compare the intersection in Fd of two cells in [Zd\u2217 , Fd ] with an intersection\nin Zd . Our first result will hold for arbitrary homogeneous spaces.\nLet X be a homogeneous space and Y \u2282 X a Schubert subvariety. Suppose that Y is smooth,\nand even homogeneous. The cell decomposition of X defined by the Schubert cells, gives a cell\ndecomposition of Y if we consider only those Schubert cells that are contained in Y . In particular this\nyields a natural inclusion WY \u0592\u2192 WX . We denote pX : WX \u2192 WX the Poincar\u00e9 duality on X and\npY : WY \u2192 WY the Poincar\u00e9 duality on Y .\nConsider the submodule Z[Y \u2217 , X] of H \u2217 (X) generated byPthe Schubert classes in [Y \u2217 , X]. This\nmodule has a natural algebra structure: if [X(u)] \u222a [X(v)] = w\u2208WX cw\nu,v [X(w)] in X, set\nX\n[X(u)] * [X(v)] =\ncw\nu,v [X(w)].\nw\u2208[Y \u2217 ,X]\n\nLet j denote the inclusion Y \u2192 X; the morphism of modules j\u2217 : H\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 H\u2217 (X) is injective and the\ndual morphism of algebras j \u2217 : H \u2217 (X) \u2192 H \u2217 (Y ) is surjective. The image of j\u2217 is Z[pt, Y ]; we denote\nby j\u2217\u22121 the inverse map Z[pt, Y ] \u2192 H\u2217 (Y ).\nProposition 3.1 The restriction of j \u2217 to Z[Y \u2217 , X] is an algebra isomorphism with H \u2217 (Y ). Explicitely, it equals pY \u25e6 j\u2217\u22121 \u25e6 pX .\nProof. The first assertion is an immediate consequence of [CMP, lemma 3.12]. To prove the second\none, let C \u2208 Z[pt, Y ] \u2282 H\u2217 (X), and let D \u2208 H \u2217 (X). Since j\u2217 and j \u2217 are adjoint, we have:\n(j\u2217 pY j \u2217 pX (C), D)X\n\n= (pY j \u2217 pX (C), j \u2217 D)Y\n= \u03b4j \u2217 pX (C),j \u2217 D\n= \u03b4pX (C),D = (C, D)X\n\nThe second and the third equality follow from the fact that j \u2217 maps bijectively Schubert classes to\nSchubert classes. We therefore have proved that C = j\u2217 pY j \u2217 pX (C) for all C in Z[pt, Y ] or, equivalently,\nthat j \u2217 D = pY j\u2217\u22121 pX (D) for all D in Z[Y \u2217 , X].\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.2 Let Y \u2282 X be a homogeneous Schubert subvariety of some rational homogeneous\nmanifold.

Our main examples of homogeneous Schubert subvarieties are our varieties Td and Yd in X and Zd in Fd . Applying the previous result to the latter\nvarieties, we get the following statement.\nTheorem 3.3 For any u \u2208 WX , we have\n\u03c3(pt) \u2217 \u03c3(u) = q \u03b4(u) \u03c3(p\u03b9(u)).\nProof.

For convenience we will in fact prove a slightly different (but equivalent) statement, asserting the\nexistence of a duality mapping q to q \u22121 . With the notable exception of Grassmannians, this is only\npossible if we extend scalars a little bit.\nWe will need a case by case analysis to fix the coefficients \u03b6(w) in the next statement.\nTheorem 4.1 For any (co)minuscule homogeneous variety X, one can find an algebraic number \u03ba,\nand a map \u03b6 : WX \u2192 Z[\u03ba], such that the correspondence\nq 7\u2192 q \u22121 ,\n\n\u03c3(w) 7\u2192 \u03b6(w)q \u2212\u03b4(w) \u03c3(\u03b9(w))\n\ndefines a ring involution of QA\u2217 (X)loc [\u03ba].\nClearly, such an involution changes the degree into its opposite, and the fact that it is involutive is\ntantamount to the simple relation \u03b6 \u25e6 \u03b9 = \u03b6 \u22121 . The hard part of the statement is that it is compatible\nwith the quantum product.\nTo get rid of \u03ba, there remains to compose the previous involution with a degree automorphism\n(that multiplies a degree d class by td for some t). It is then a routine but again case by case check\nthat we obtain Theorem 1.1. That is, we check that\nl(w)\n1 (X)\n\n\u2212c\n\n\u03b6(w) = y(w)y(s\u03b10 )\n\n.\n\nBut we have no convincing explanation of why such a formula should hold true.\n\n4.1\n\nQuadrics\n\nWe begin with the easy example of quadrics. We will see that already in that case fixing the coefficients\ninvolves some subtelties.\n5\n\n\fEven dimensions\nLet Q2m be a quadric of dimension 2m, acted on by SO2m+2 . The simple root that defines the\ncorresponding maximal parabolic subgroup is \u03b11 . The Hasse diagram is the following:\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n+\n\u03c3m\n\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n1\n\n\u2022\u2212\n\u03c3m\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\nH\n\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n\nIndeed, as is well known, there is one Schubert class \u03c3k in each degre k 6= m, and two Schubert\n\u00b1 in middle degree, defined by the two families of maximal linear spaces in Q2m . Of course\nclasses \u03c3m\n\u03c31 = H is the hyperplane class. For the classical intersection product, we have H k = \u03c3k for k < m,\n+ + \u03c3 \u2212 , and H k = 2\u03c3 for k > m. Since c (Q2m ) = 2m, these formulas remain valid in the\nH m = \u03c3m\n1\nk\nm\nquantum Chow ring, except in maximal degree. In fact the quantum Chevalley formula gives the two\nidentities\n\u03c32m\u22121 \u2217 H = \u03c32m + q,\n\u03c32m \u2217 H = qH.\nNote that \u03c32m\u22121 is the class of a line and coincides with [T1 ]. Also \u03c32m is the class [pt] of a point.\nProposition 4.2 The quantum Chow ring QA\u2217 (Q2m ) is determined by the formulas\n+\n\u2212\n= [pt],\n\u2217 \u03c3m\n\u03c3m\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n= q.\n\u2217 \u03c3m\n\u03c3m\n\u2217 \u03c3m\n= \u03c3m\n\nNote that these relations imply that H 2m = 2[pt] + 2q and H 2m+1 = 4qH. Now it is easy to check\nthat QA\u2217 (Q2m )loc has a ring involution given by\nq 7\u2192 1/16q,\n\nH k 7\u2192 H 2m\u2212k /4q,\n\n[pt] 7\u2192 [pt]/16q 2 ,\n\n\u00b1 7\u2192 \u03c3 \u2213 /4q.\n(where the central formula holds for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2m \u2212 1), and in middle degree by \u03c3m\nm\nMultiplying each degree d class by 2d , we get a slightly different involution given by\n\nq\n\u03c3k\n\u00b1\n\u03c3m\n\u03c3k\n[pt]\n\n7 22m\u22124 /q,\n\u2192\n7\u2192 2k\u22121 \u03c32m\u2212k /q for 0 < k < m,\n\u2213,\n7\u2192 2m\u22122 \u03c3m\n7\u2192 2k\u22123 \u03c32m\u2212k /q for m < k < 2m,\n7\u2192 22m\u22124 [pt]/q 2 .\n\nThis is precisely the statement of Theorem 1.1 for Q2m , as one can readily check from the Hasse\ndiagram above. Indeed, we have labeled the edges by the coefficients whose products, taken from the\nrightmost end of the diagram, give the coefficients y(w). The corresponding coefficients for Theorem\n4.1 are the following, where \u03b6(m) accounts for the two mid-dimensional classes:\n\u03b6(k) = 4\n\nk\u2212m\nm\n\nfor 0 < k < 2m,\n\n\u03b6(0) = \u03b6(2m) = 1,\n\nOdd dimensions\nAn odd dimensional quadric Q2m\u22121 is cominuscule but not minuscule. It has exactly one Schubert\nclass \u03c3k in each dimension k < 2m. Again \u03c31 = H is the hyperplane class. The Hasse diagram is the\nsimplest possible one; as in the even dimensional case we have labeled the edges by the coefficients\nwhose products, taken from the rightmost end, give the y(w) of Theorem 1.1.\n6\n\n\f\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n\nH\n\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u2022\n\nFor the classical intersection product, we have H k = \u03c3k for k < m, H k = 2\u03c3k for k \u2265 m. Since\nc1 (Q2m\u22121 ) = 2m \u2212 1, these formulas hold in the quantum Chow ring, except in maximal degree. In\nfact the quantum Chevalley formula gives the two identities\n\u03c32m\u22122 \u2217 H = \u03c32m\u22121 + q,\n\n\u03c32m\u22121 \u2217 H = qH.\n\nThis is enough to determine the quantum product. The class \u03c32m\u22122 is that of a line and coincides\nwith [T1 ]. Also \u03c32m\u22121 is the class [pt] of a point.\nAgain it is easy to check that QA\u2217 (Q2m\u22121 )loc has a ring involution given by almost the same\nformulas that in even dimensions,\nq 7\u2192 1/16q,\n\nH k 7\u2192 H 2m\u2212k\u22121 /4q,\n\n[pt] 7\u2192 [pt]/16q 2 ,\n\n(where the central formula holds for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2m \u2212 2). Multiplying each degree d class by 2d , we get\nthe slightly different involution given by\nq\n\u03c3k\n\u03c3k\n[pt]\n\n7\u2192 22m\u22125 /q,\n7\u2192 2k\u22121 \u03c32m\u2212k\u22121 /q\n7\u2192 2k\u22123 \u03c32m\u2212k\u22121 /q\n7\u2192 22m\u22125 [pt]/q 2 .\n\nfor 0 < k < m,\nfor m \u2264 k < 2m \u2212 1,\n\nThis is in perfect agreement with Theorem 1.1.\n\n4.2\n\nGrassmannians\n\nNow suppose X = G(p, n) is a Grassmannian. Then WX identifies with the set of partitions inscribed\nin the rectangle p \u00d7 (n \u2212 p), and dmax = min(p, n \u2212 p). For any d \u2282 dmax , Yd is a Grassmannian\nG(d, 2d), and Td is another Grassmannian G(p \u2212 d, n \u2212 2d). In particular the partition wYd\u2217 is just a\nsquare of size d, while the partition wTd is the complement of a rectangle of size (p \u2212 d) \u00d7 (n \u2212 p \u2212 d).\nWe deduce that for any partition \u03bb \u2208 WX , the degree d = \u03b4(\u03bb) is the size of the biggest square\ncontained in \u03bb. Clearly the interval [Td , Yd\u2217 ] in WX identifies with the Hasse diagram of the product\nG(d, p \u2212 d) \u00d7 G(d, n \u2212 p \u2212 d). The partition \u03b9(\u03bb) is deduced from \u03bb by taking the complementary\npartitions in the SW and NE rectangles.\nIn this case Theorem 4.1 appears in [P1], Theorem 7.5. See also [H] where the involution is\ninterpreted in terms of complex conjugation.\n\n4.3\n\nLagrangian Grassmannians\n\nLet X = G\u03c9 (n, 2n) be a Lagrangian Grassmannian. Recall that WX identifies with the set of strict\npartitions \u03bb \u2282 \u03c1n . In order to simplify notations we let \u03c3\u03bb denote the class of the Schubert subvariety\nPoincar\u00e9 dual to X(\u03bb). Its degree is the sum |\u03bb| of the parts of \u03bb. Morevoer, d = \u03b4(\u03bb) is simply the\nnumber of (non zero) parts of \u03bb, usually called the length and denoted l(\u03bb). In particular dmax = n.\nMapping \u03bb to (\u03bb1 \u2212 d, . . . , \u03bbd \u2212 1) we get a partition inscribed in the rectangle d \u00d7 (n \u2212 d). This\nidentifies the interval Wd of WX with the Hasse diagram of the Grassmannian G(d, n). Appying\nPoincar\u00e9 duality for that Grassmannian we dedude that the involution \u03b9 is given by\n\u03b9(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbl(\u03bb) ) = (n + 1 \u2212 \u03bbl(\u03bb) , . . . , n + 1 \u2212 \u03bb1 ).\n7\n\n\fExample 4.3 For n = 5 we have drawn below the Hasse diagram of G\u03c9 (5, 10) and its partition into\nsix disjoint intervals. More precisely we have drawn in black the arrows between different intervals,\nand in the same color the arrows inside a given interval. Those are the Hasse diagrams of a point, of\nP4 and of the Grassmannian G(2, 5), all appearing twice and symmetrically.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2|\u03bb|\nProposition 4.4 For \u03bb \u2282 \u03c1n a strict partition, let z(\u03bb) := l(\u03bb)\u2212 n+1\n. Then z(\u03b9(\u03bb)) = z(\u03bb\u2217 ) = \u2212z(\u03bb),\nand Theorem 4.1 holds with\n2\nand\n\u03b6(\u03bb) = 2z(\u03bb) .\n\u03ba = 2\u2212 n+1\n\nProof. We just need to prove that our involution is compatible with the quantum Pieri formula for\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k , for each k. We have \u03b9(\u03c3k ) = q \u22121 \u03c3n+1\u2212k , so we need to compare \u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k with \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bb) \u2217 \u03c3n+1\u2212k .\nWe use the quantum version of Pieri's rule as stated in [BKT], Theorem 3:\nX\nX \u2032\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k =\n2N (\u03bb,\u03bc) \u03c3\u03bc + q\n2N (\u03bd,\u03bb) \u03c3\u03bd ,\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the first sum is over all strict partitions \u03bc \u2283 \u03bb with |\u03bc| = |\u03bb| + k, such that the complement \u03bc/\u03bb\nis a horizontal strip, and the second sum is over all strict partitions \u03bd \u2282 \u03bb with |\u03bd| = |\u03bb| \u2212 (n + 1 \u2212 k),\nsuch that the \u03bb/\u03bd is a horizontal strip. Moreover N (\u03bb, \u03bc) denotes the number of connected components\nof \u03bc/\u03bb which do no meet the first column, and N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb) is one less than the total number of connected\ncomponents of \u03bb/\u03bd. (By definition, two boxes are connected if they share an edge or a vertex.)\nApplying our involution, we get\nP\nP\n\u03b9(\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k ) = q \u2212l(\u03bb) l(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb) 2z(\u03bc)+N (\u03bb,\u03bc) \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bc) + q \u2212l(\u03bb)\u22121 l(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb)+1 2z(\u03bc)+N (\u03bb,\u03bc) \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bc)\nP\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+q \u2212l(\u03bb)\u22121 l(\u03bd)=l(\u03bb) 2z(\u03bd)+N (\u03bd,\u03bb) \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bd) + q \u2212l(\u03bb) l(\u03bd)=l(\u03bb)\u22121 2z(\u03bd)+N (\u03bd,\u03bb) \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bd) .\n(1)\n\nSimilarly, we deduce again from Pieri's rule that\n\u0010\nP\nP\n\u03b9(\u03c3\u03bb ) \u2217 \u03b9(\u03c3k ) = 2z(\u03bb)+z(k) q \u2212l(\u03bb)\u22121 l(\u03b1)=l(\u03bb) 2N (\u03b9(\u03bb),\u03b1) \u03c3\u03b1 + q \u2212l(\u03bb)\u22121 l(\u03b1)=l(\u03bb)+1 2N (\u03b9(\u03bb),\u03b1) \u03c3\u03b1\n\u0011\nP\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+q \u2212l(\u03bb) l(\u03b2)=l(\u03bb) 2N (\u03b2,\u03b9(\u03bb)) \u03c3\u03b2 + q \u2212l(\u03bb) l(\u03b2)=l(\u03bb)\u22121 2N (\u03b2,\u03b9(\u03bb)) \u03c3\u03b2 .\n(2)\n\nWe claim that the four partial sums on the right hand sides of the two identities above correspond\npairwise.\nConsider the first term on the right hand side of (2). Here \u03b1 is a strict partition containing \u03b9(\u03bb),\nof size |\u03b1| = |\u03b9(\u03bb)| + n + 1 \u2212 k, such that \u03b1/\u03b9(\u03bb) is a horizontal strip. If we let \u03bd = \u03b9(\u03b1), we get\nthat \u03bd is contained in \u03bb, l(\u03bd) = l(\u03b1) and |\u03bd| = |\u03bb| \u2212 (n + 1 \u2212 k), and \u03bb/\u03bd \u2243 \u03b1/\u03b9(\u03bb) is a horizontal\n8\n\n\fstrip. Moreover, the fact that l(\u03b1) = l(\u03bb) means that \u03b1/\u03b9(\u03bb) does not meet the first column, so\nN (\u03b9(\u03bb), \u03b1) = N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb) + 1. On the other hand,\nz(\u03bd) = l(\u03bb) \u2212\n\n2\n(|\u03bb| \u2212 (n + 1 \u2212 k)) = z(\u03bb) + z(k) + 1,\nn+1\n\nand therefore z(\u03bd) + N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb) = z(\u03bb) + z(k) + N (\u03b9(\u03bb), \u03b1). We conclude that the first partial sum of\n(2) coincides exactly with the third partial sum of (1).\nFor the second term on the right hand side of (2), the difference with the first term is that\nl(\u03b1) = l(\u03bb) + 1, which means that \u03b1/\u03b9(\u03bb) does meet the first column. Thus N (\u03b9(\u03bb), \u03b1) = N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb).\nOn the other hand,\nz(\u03bd) = l(\u03bb) + 1 \u2212\n\n2\n(|\u03bb| + (n + 1) \u2212 (n + 1 \u2212 k)) = z(\u03bb) + z(k),\nn+1\n\nand therefore we get again z(\u03bd) + N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb) = z(\u03bb) + z(k) + N (\u03b9(\u03bb), \u03b1). We conclude that the second\npartial sum of (2) coincides exactly with the second partial sum of (1).\nNow consider the third term on the right hand side of (2). Here \u03b2 is a strict partition contained in\n\u03b9(\u03bb), with l(\u03b2) = l(\u03bb) and |\u03b2| = |\u03b9(\u03bb)| \u2212 k, such that \u03b9(\u03bb)/\u03b2 is a horizontal strip. If we let \u03b2 = \u03b9(\u03bc),\nwe get \u03b9(\u03bb)/\u03b2 \u2243 \u03bc/\u03bb, so |\u03bc| = |\u03bb| + k and N \u2032 (\u03b2, \u03b9(\u03bb)) = N \u2032 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = N (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2212 1. Again we deduce that\nz(\u03bb) + z(k) + N \u2032 (\u03b2, \u03b9(\u03bb)) = z(\u03bc) + N (\u03bb, \u03bc), so that the third partial sum of (2) coincides exactly with\nthe first partial sum of (1).\nFinally, consider the third term on the right hand side of (2). Here \u03b2 is as before except that\nl(\u03b2) = l(\u03bb) \u2212 1, so that if we let \u03bd = \u03b9(\u03b2), then N \u2032 (\u03b2, \u03b9(\u03bb)) = N \u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bb). Again we conclude that the\nfourth partial sum of (2) coincides exactly with the fourth partial sum of (1).\nThis concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nAs we have already mentionned, it is possible to get rid of the root of two by composing with a\ndegree automorphism. We get:\nTheorem 4.5 The correspondence\n4\nq 7\u2192 ,\nq\n\n\u03c3\u03bb 7\u2192\n\n\u0010 2 \u0011l(\u03bb)\nq\n\n\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bb)\n\nf or \u03bb \u2282 \u03c1n ,\n\ndefines a ring involution of QA\u2217 (G\u03c9 (n, 2n))loc .\n\n4.4\n\nOrthogonal Grassmannians\n\nLet X = GQ (n + 1, 2n + 2) be a Lagrangian Grassmannian. Recall that WX identifies again with the\nset of strict partitions \u03bb \u2282 \u03c1n . Again we denote by \u03c3\u03bb the Schubert class Poincar\u00e9 dual to [X(\u03bb)].\nIts degree is |\u03bb|, and \u03b4(\u03bb) = d if the number of (non zero) parts of \u03bb is 2d or 2d \u2212 1. In particular\ndmax = [n/2].\nMapping \u03bb to (\u03bb1 \u2212 2d + 1, . . . , \u03bb2d ) (where we let \u03bb2d = 0 if l(\u03bb) = 2d \u2212 1), we get a partition\ninscribed in the rectangle 2d \u00d7 (n \u2212 2d + 1). This identifies the interval Wd of WX with the Hasse\ndiagram of the Grassmannian G(2d, n + 1). Appying Poincar\u00e9 duality for that Grassmannian we\ndedude that the involution \u03b9 is given by\n\u03b9(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2\u03b4(\u03bb) ) = (n \u2212 \u03bb2\u03b4(\u03bb) , . . . , n \u2212 \u03bb1 ).\nExample 4.6 For n = 5 we have drawn below the Hasse diagram of GQ (6, 12) and its partition into\nfour disjoint intervals. Note that the diagram is the same as for G\u03c9 (5, 10) but the partition is different.\nIndeed we have only four intervals in that case, isomorphic with the Hasse diagrams of a point and of\nG(2, 6) appearing twice symmetrically. (Beware that this symmetry is specific to the case where n is\nodd.)\n9\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nProposition 4.7 For \u03bb \u2282 \u03c1n a strict partition, let z(\u03bb) :=\nz(\u03bb\u2217 ) = \u2212z(\u03bb), and Theorem 4.1 holds with\n2\n\n\u03ba = 2\u2212 n\n\nand\n\n2|\u03bb|\nn\n\n\u2212 (l(\u03bb) + \u03b4\u03bb1 ,n ).

The proof is notably different from that of Theorem 4.5, since we have\n\u03b9(\u03c3k ) = q \u22121 \u03c3n,n\u2212k = q \u22121 \u03c3n \u2217 \u03c3n\u2212k .\nAgain we check that our formula is compatible with the quantum version of Pieri's rule as stated in\n[BKT], Theorem 6:\nX \u2032\nX \u2032\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k =\n2N (\u03bb,\u03bc) \u03c3\u03bc + q\n2N (\u03bb,\u03bd) \u03c3\u03bd\u0304 ,\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the first sum is over all strict partitions \u03bc \u2283 \u03bb with |\u03bc| = |\u03bb| + k, such that \u03bc/\u03bb is a horizontal\nstrip, and the second sum is over all partitions \u03bd = (n, n, \u03bd\u0304) \u2283 \u03bb, with \u03bd\u0304 strict and |\u03bd| = |\u03bb| + k, such\nthat \u03bd/\u03bb is a horizontal strip. Note that the quantum correction is non trivial zero when \u03bb1 = n.\nWe distinguish several cases.\nFirst case: \u03bb1 < n. Then\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k =\n\nX\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bc)\n\n\u03c3\u03bc +\n\nl(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb)\n\nX\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bc)\n\n\u03c3\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nl(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb)+1\n\nhas no quantum correction.\nFirst subcase: \u03b9(\u03bb)1 < n. This means that l(\u03bb) = 2\u03b4(\u03bb), so that on the right hand side of (3) we have\n\u03b4(\u03bc) = \u03b4(\u03bb) in the first partial sum and \u03b4(\u03bc) = \u03b4(\u03bb) + 1 in the second one.

We claim that\nN \u2032 ((n, \u03b9(\u03bb)), \u03b2) = N \u2032 (\u03bb, \u03bc) + 1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n .\n10\n\n\fThe following picture should help to see this. We have represented the partition \u03bb in thick lines, so\nthat \u03b9(\u03bb) is its complement (reversed) in the rectangle l(\u03bb) \u00d7 n. We have added a line a the bottom\nof this rectangle to represent (n, \u03b9(\u03bb)) (again reversed). The \u2022's represent \u03b2/(n, \u03b9(\u03bb)) (reversed), a\nhorizontal strip inside \u03bb \u2013 except possibly if l(\u03b2) = l(\u03bb) + 2, in which case there are some \u2022's on\nthe line above the first line of \u03bb. The \u25e6's represent \u03bc/\u03bb, again a horizontal strip. On each line they\ncomplement the \u2022's of the line above. So we start with a connected component of \u2022's on the SW\ncorner of the picture, and going NE we successively meet the connected components of \u25e6's and \u2022's.\nWe have thus the same number of components, or one more for the \u2022's if we end by one of these at\nthe NE corner. This is the case if and only if \u03bc1 < n, so our claim follows.\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u25e6\n\u2022 \u25e6\n\n\u03b9(\u03bb)\n\n\u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6\n\u2022 \u2022\n\nBut z(\u03bb) + z(k) \u2212 z(\u03bc) = \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n \u2212 1, so z(\u03bb) + z(k) + N \u2032 ((n, \u03b9(\u03bb)), \u03b2) = z(\u03bc) + N \u2032 (\u03bb, \u03bc). We conclude\nthat the first sum of (4) coincides with the second sum of (5).\nNow consider some \u03bc in the second sum on the right hand side of (4). Since l(\u03bc) = 2\u03b4(\u03bb) + 1 is\nodd, we get \u03b9(\u03bc) = (n, \u03b1) for some strict partition \u03b1. We claim that\nN \u2032 (\u03b9(\u03bb), \u03b1) = N \u2032 (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n .\nAgain this implies that the second sum of (4) coincides with the first sum of (5), and we are done.\nSecond subcase: \u03b9(\u03bb)1 = n. Then l(\u03bb) = 2\u03b4(\u03bb) \u2212 1, and in (3) we always have \u03b4(\u03bc) = \u03b4(\u03bb). Hence\n\u03b9(\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k ) = q \u2212\u03b4(\u03bb)\n\nX\n\n2z(\u03bc)+N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bc)\n\n\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bc) .\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bc\n\nOn the other hand, \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bb) \u2217 \u03c3n = q\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bb)/n , where the first part of \u03b9(\u03bb)/n is smaller than n. In particular,\nthe quantum Pieri rule for \u03c3\u03b9(\u03bb)/n \u2217 \u03c3n\u2212k has no quantum correction. We get\n\u03b9(\u03c3\u03bb ) \u2217 \u03b9(\u03c3k ) = 2z(\u03bb)+z(k) q \u2212\u03b4(\u03bb)\n\nX\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03b9(\u03bb)/n,\u03b1)\n\n\u03c3\u03b1 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1\n\nthe sum being taken over all strict partitions \u03b1 \u2283 \u03b9(\u03bb)/n, with |\u03b1| = |\u03b9(\u03bb)/n| + n \u2212 k = |\u03b9(\u03bb)| \u2212 k,\nsuch that \u03b1/(\u03b9(\u03bb)/n) is a horizontal strip. Let \u03bc = \u03b9(\u03b1), and note that \u03b4(\u03bc) = \u03b4(\u03b1) = \u03b4(\u03b1) since\nl(\u03b9(\u03bb)/n) = l(\u03bb) is odd. We claim that\nN \u2032 (\u03b9(\u03bb)/n, \u03b1) = N \u2032 (\u03bb, \u03bc) + \u03b4l(\u03bc),l(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n .\nSince we have z(\u03bc) \u2212 z(\u03bb) \u2212 z(k) = 1 + l(\u03bb) \u2212 l(\u03bc) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n = \u03b4l(\u03bc),l(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc1 ,n , we conclude that the\ncoefficients of \u03c3\u03bc in (3) and (6) are equal, which is what we wanted to prove.\nSecond case: \u03bb1 = n. Then we must take care of the quantum correction in Pieri's rule. We write\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2217 \u03c3k =\n\nX\n\nl(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb)\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bc)\n\n\u03c3\u03bc +\n\nX\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bc)\n\n\u03c3\u03bc + q\n\nl(\u03bc)=l(\u03bb)+1\n\nX\n\nl(\u03bd)=l(\u03bb)\n\n11\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bd)\n\n\u03c3\u03bd\u0304 + q\n\nX\n\nl(\u03bd)=l(\u03bb)+1\n\n2N\n\n\u2032 (\u03bb,\u03bd)\n\n\u03c3\u03bd\u0304 .

We know from [CMP]\nthat the quantum cohomology ring is generated over Z[q] by the classes H, \u03c35\u2032 and \u03c39 , and we know\nthe relations explicitely.

Then we computed the image\nof each Schubert class and checked that it is given by the explicit form of Theorem 1.1.\n13\n\n\f5\n\nSymmetries of Gromov-Witten invariants\n\nFor convenience, denote by p the symmetry of WX given by Poincar\u00e9 duality. We deduce from Theorem\n4.1 the following identity for the quantum product:\nTheorem 5.1 For any u, v \u2208 WX , we have\n\u03c3(\u03b9(u)) \u2217 \u03c3(p(v)) = q \u03b4(u)+\u03b4(p(u))\u2212\u03b4(v)\u2212\u03b4(p\u03b9(v)) \u03c3(p\u03b9p(u)) \u2217 \u03c3(\u03b9p\u03b9(v)).\nProof. Theorem 4.1 is equivalent to the following identity for Gromov-Witten invariants:\nIk (u, v, w) = \u03b6(u)\u03b6(v)\u03b6(w)I\u03b4(u)+\u03b4(v)\u2212\u03b4(p(w))\u2212k (\u03b9(u), \u03b9(v), p\u03b9p(w)).\n\n(11)\n\nUsing the fact that \u03b6(\u03b9(u)) = \u03b6(p(u)) = \u03b6(u)\u22121 , the same identity gives\nIl (p\u03b9p(w), \u03b9(u), \u03b9(v)) = (\u03b6(u)\u03b6(v)\u03b6(w))\u22121 I\u03b4(p\u03b9p(w))+\u03b4(u)\u2212\u03b4(p\u03b9(v))\u2212l (\u03b9p\u03b9p(w), u, p\u03b9p\u03b9(v)).\nCombining these two relations, we get\nIk (u, v, w) = Ik+\u03b4(p(w))+\u03b4(p\u03b9p(w))\u2212\u03b4(p\u03b9(v))\u2212\u03b4(v) (u, p\u03b9p\u03b9(v), \u03b9p\u03b9p(w)),\nwhich is equivalent to the identity for the quantum product\n\u03c3(p\u03b9p\u03b9(v)) \u2217 \u03c3(\u03b9p\u03b9p(w)) = q \u03b4(p(w))+\u03b4(p\u03b9p(w))\u2212\u03b4(p\u03b9(v))\u2212\u03b4(v) \u03c3(v) \u2217 \u03c3(w).\nReplacing v by \u03b9(u) and w by p(v) yields our claim.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that Theorem 5.1 is non trivial only when p and \u03b9 don't commute.\nNow we observe that Theorem 3.3 can be used to generate more symmetries for the Gromov-Witten\ninvariants. The following statement is a generalization of Proposition 4.10 in [CMP].\nCorollary 5.2 For any u \u2208 WX , we have\n[Ydmax ] \u2217 \u03c3(u) = q \u03b4(u)+\u03b4(p\u03b9(u))\u2212dmax \u03c3(p\u03b9p\u03b9(u)),\n[Yd\u2217max ] \u2217 \u03c3(u) = q dmax \u2212\u03b4(p(u)) \u03c3(\u03b9p(u)).\nProof. To prove the first identity, multiply the identity of Theorem 3.3 by \u03c3(pt) and use the fact that\n\u03c3(pt) \u2217 \u03c3(pt) = q dmax [Ydmax ]. For the second identity, observe that Theorem 3.3 implies that \u03c3(pt) is\ninvertible in QA\u2217 (X)loc , and its inverse verifies the formula\n\u03c3(pt)\u22121 \u2217 \u03c3(u) = q \u2212\u03b4(p(u)) \u03c3(\u03b9p(u)).\nApplying this to the fundamental class \u03c3(1) = 1 yields \u03c3(pt)\u22121 = q \u2212dmax [Yd\u2217max ], which we just need\nto substitute in the previous identity.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.3 For any u, v \u2208 WX , we have\nq \u03b4(u) \u03c3(p(u)) \u2217 \u03c3(\u03b9(v)) = q \u03b4(v) \u03c3(\u03b9(u)) \u2217 \u03c3(p(v)).\nProof. Multiply the identity of Theorem 3.3 for \u03b9(u) by the Schubert class \u03c3(\u03b9(v)), and use the associativity of the quantum product.\n\u0003\nTogether with Theorem 4.1, we get a series of symmetry relations for the Gromov-Witten invariants, which are generated by the following simple ones:\n14\n\n\fCorollary 5.4 For any u, v, w \u2208 WX , we have the relation\nIk (u, v, w) = \u03b6(u)\u03b6(v)\u03b6(w)I\u03b4(w)\u2212k (p(u), p(v), \u03b9(w)).\nProof. In terms of Gromov-Witten invariants, Corollary 5.3 writes\nIk\u2212\u03b4(u) (p(u), \u03b9(v), w) = Ik\u2212\u03b4(v) (\u03b9(u), p(v), w).\nCombining with the identity (11), we deduce that\nIk (u, v, w) = Ik+\u03b4(p(u))\u2212\u03b4(v) (\u03b9p(u), p\u03b9(v), w)\n= Ik+\u03b4(p(u))\u2212\u03b4(v) (\u03b9p(u), w, p\u03b9(v))\n= \u03b6(\u03b9p(u))\u03b6(w)\u03b6(p\u03b9(v))I\u03b4(p(u))+\u03b4(w)\u2212\u03b4(v))\u2212(k+\u03b4(p(u))\u2212\u03b4(v)) (p(u), \u03b9(w), p(v))\n= \u03b6(u)\u03b6(w)\u03b6(v)I\u03b4(w)\u2212k (p(u), p(v), \u03b9(w)).\nThis is what we wanted to prove.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.5 For u, v \u2208 WX , the maximal power of q that appears in the quantum product of the\nSchubert classes \u03c3(u) \u2217 \u03c3(v) is\ndmax (u, v) = \u03b4(u) \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b9(u), p(v)) = \u03b4(v) \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b9(v), p(u)).\nCorollary 5.4 suggests to study the group \u0393 of permutations of WX3 generated by (p, p, \u03b9), (p, \u03b9, p),\n(\u03b9, p, p). Clearly the size of this group is governed by the order \u03b7 of the permutation p\u03b9 of WX .\nProposition 5.6 The order of \u0393 is 2\u03b7 2 , and \u03b7 is given by the following table:\nX\n\n\u03b7\n\nG(p, n)\nG\u03c9 (n, 2n)\nGQ (n, 2n)\nOP2\nE7 /P7\n\nn/gcd(p, n \u2212 p)\n2\n4/gcd(2, n)\n3\n2\n\nNote that \u03b7 always divides the order of the symmetry group of the affine Dynkin diagram of G.\nProof. Let \u03930 denote the group of permutations of WX generated by the two involutions p and \u03b9. The\norder of \u03930 is 2\u03b7. Moreover, the projection on the first factor yields a morphism \u0393 \u2192 \u03930 which is\nobviously surjective. Its kernel consists in the permutations of type (1, (pi)k , (ip)k ), with k \u2208 Z, so its\norder is \u03b7. Thus the order of \u0393 is 2\u03b7 2 .\nFor the explicit values of \u03b7, first consider the case of X = G(p, n). A partition \u03bb \u2208 WX can be\nidentified with a 01-sequence \u03c9 with p ones and n \u2212 p zeroes encoding vertical and horizontal steps\nalong the boundary of \u03bb, starting from the SW corner. Then the size of the biggest square contained\nin \u03bb is the number of zeroes among the first p terms of the sequence. Moreover, reading the sequence\nbackwards we get the sequence \u03c9 \u2217 of the Poincar\u00e9 dual partition p(\u03bb). So to get the sequence \u03c9 \u2032 of\n\u03b9(\u03bb), we write \u03c9 = \u03c90 \u03c91 where \u03c90 has length p and \u03c91 has length n \u2212 p, and let \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c90\u2217 \u03c91\u2217 . To deduce\nthe sequence \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 of p\u03b9(\u03bb) we simply reverse \u03c9 \u2032 , so \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = \u03c91 \u03c90 . The claim easily follows.\nNow suppose X = GQ (n, 2n). We identify a strict partition \u03bb \u2208 WX with a 01-sequence \u03c9 of\nlength n as follows. First we consider it as a usual partition in a square of size (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) and\nwe let \u03c9 \u2032 be the associated 01-sequence, of length 2n + 2. It begins with a 1 and ends with a 0. We\nsuppress the initial 1...10 sequence. Moreover, since \u03bb is strict every 1 is followed by a 0, which we\n15\n\n\fsuppress. The resulting sequence has length n and is our \u03c9 = \u03c91 * * * \u03c9n . Note that the length of \u03bb is\nthe number of 1's.\nWe check that p and \u03b9 are easily expressed in terms of 01-sequences:\np(\u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03c9\u03041 * * * \u03c9\u0304n ,\n\n\u03b9(\u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03c9n\u22121 * * * \u03c91 \u03c90 ,\n\nwhere \u03c90 = \u03c91 + * * * + \u03c9n (mod 2) and 0\u0304 = 1, 1\u0304 = 0. So p\u03b9(\u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03c9\u0304n\u22121 * * * \u03c9\u03041 \u03c9\u03040 , and p\u03b9p\u03b9(\u03bb) 7\u2192\n\u03c91 * * * \u03c9n\u22121 \u03c9n\u2032 , where \u03c9n\u2032 = \u03c9n if n is even and \u03c9n\u2032 = \u03c9\u0304n if n is odd.\nThe case of G\u03c9 (n, 2n), and also that of E7 /P7 are trivial, since p commutes with \u03b9. Finally the\ncase of OP2 follows from an explicit computation.\n\u0003\nFor a Grassmannian G(p, n), we get a Zn -symmetry only when (p, n) = 1, while this symmetry\nalways exists by [P1]. Does the same phenomenon happen for GQ (2m, 4m) ? That is, does our twofold\nsymmetry extend to a fourfold symmetry ?\nThe cases for which \u03b7 = 2 are the most symmetric: the involution \u03b9 commutes with Poincar\u00e9\nduality. In particular we get the relation\n\u03b4(u) + \u03b4(p(u)) = dmax .\nThe Gromov-Witten invariants are identified by groups of eight according to the following identities:\nIk (u, v, w) = \u03b6(u)\u03b6(v)\u03b6(w)I\u03b4(w)\u2212k (p(u), p(v), \u03b9(w))\n= Ik+dmax \u2212\u03b4(v)\u2212\u03b4(w) (u, \u03b9p(v), \u03b9p(w))\n= \u03b6(u)\u03b6(v)\u03b6(w)I\u03b4(u)+\u03b4(v)+\u03b4(w)\u2212dmax \u2212k (\u03b9(u), \u03b9(v), \u03b9(w)).\nIn particular all Gromov-Witten invariants can be directly computed from those of degree k \u2264 dmax /4.\nFor the other cases we get even more identities, so that lots of Gromov-Witten invariants can be\nidentified with classical intersection numbers on the same variety.\nWe close this paper with a \"dual quantum Chevalley formula\", that we obtain by applying our\nstrange duality Theorem to the quantum Chevalley formula of [CMP]. Remember that \u03b10 denotes\nthe highest root, and that \u03c3(s\u03b10 ) = [T1 ]. The Bruhat interval [1, T1 ] has a Poincar\u00e9 involution pT1 .\nFinally, recall that we denoted by \u03b2 the simple root that defines P .\nProposition 5.7 For any u \u2208 WX , we have\n\u03c3(u) \u2217 \u03c3(s\u03b10 ) = \u03b4p(u)\u2264\u03b10 \u03c3(pT1 p(u)) + q\n\nX\n\nn\u03b1 (\u03b10 )\u03c3(s\u03b1 u) + q\u03b4\u03b9(u)\u2264\u03b10 y(p(s\u03b10 ))\u03c3(s\u03b2 u).\n\ns\u03b1 u\u2192u,\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\nThe classical intersection product \u03b4p(u)\u2264\u03b10 \u03c3(pT1 p(u)) is in agreement with Proposition 3.2. It\nwould be interesting to extend this formula to more general products.\n\nReferences\n[BKT] Buch A., Kresch A., Tamvakis H., Gromov-Witten invariants on Grassmannians, J. Amer.\nMath.
