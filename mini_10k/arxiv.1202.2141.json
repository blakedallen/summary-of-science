Introduction\nExperiments designed to directly detect weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs) [1,\n2] and other rare processes, such as neutrinoless double-beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) [3], are crucial\ntests for physics beyond the standard model. The direct detection of WIMPs will help\nelucidate the dominant source of matter in the universe. Similarly, the successful observation\nof a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay will show that the neutrino is a Majorana fermion [4] and may provide\ninformation regarding the neutrino mass scale [5]. These types of experiments are searching\nfor very rare signals; their success requires large, shielded detectors, extremely radio-pure\nconstruction materials and operation in deep underground laboratories.\nThe DEAP/CLEAN experimental program uses large volumes of liquefied argon or neon\nto search for WIMP dark matter [6\u20139]. The detectors are designed to measure the scintillation light from putative WIMP-nucleus scattering. Although electrons and \u03b3 rays, which\nscatter from atomic electrons, are well-discriminated from nuclear recoils, a neutron-nucleus\nscatter in the detector will mimic a WIMP signal [10]. For DEAP/CLEAN and other liquid\nargon-based dark matter detectors, the knowledge of both elastic and inelastic neutron scattering cross sections is crucial in predicting the neutron backgrounds. The elastic scattering\nbackground may be estimated by measuring the inelastic rate through detection of the \u03b3\nrays produced in the reactions and comparing the relative sizes of the elastic and inelastic\nneutron scattering cross sections.\nThe GERDA experiment [11] is searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 in 76 Ge by using enriched high-purity\ngermanium (HPGe) detectors submerged directly in a cryostat filled with liquid argon. The\nMajorana experiment [12\u201314] is also searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 in\n\n76\n\nGe but is using a compact\n\nshield made of lead and copper. Argon is a candidate active shielding material for a tonscale\n\n76\n\nGe experiment combining the most successful technologies used in the Majorana\n\nCorresponding author\nEmail address: spm@physics.unc.edu (S.

C\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\n\fand GERDA experiments. The experimental signature of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is a mono-energetic peak\nin the HPGe energy spectrum at the Q-value of the decay, which is 2039 keV for\n\n76\n\nGe.\n\nThe \u03b3-ray emissions from naturally occurring radioisotopes may scatter several times and\ndeposit energy in the detectors producing a continuum overwhelming the potential signal.\nFor this reason, the successful detection of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 will require radioactive backgrounds at\nunprecedentedly low levels. At these levels, backgrounds which were previously unimportant\nmust be considered. Since the underground muon-induced neutron energy spectrum extends\nto several GeV, backgrounds from \u03b3 rays produced in (n, xn\u03b3) reactions will be a concern\nfor next-generation 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments [15]. Many (n, xn\u03b3) cross sections are unknown and\nmeasurements are crucial as the depth requirement for a tonne-scale\n\n76\n\nGe experiment will\n\nbe driven by the magnitude of muon-induced backgrounds [16].\nCross sections for 40 Ar(n, n\u2032 \u03b3)40 Ar have been measured at En = 3.5 MeV for the first few\nexcited states in\n\n40\n\nAr by Mathur and Morgan [17]. We have extended these measurements\n\nto 1 < En < 30 MeV and have measured several \u03b3-ray production cross sections that were\npreviously unmeasured. The inclusion of Ar(n, xn\u03b3) cross sections over a wide energy range\nin Monte Carlo codes will help in predicting \u03b3-ray backgrounds in 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments and\nneutron backgrounds in dark matter experiments. This work is a continuation of previous\nexperiments which measured (n, xn\u03b3) reactions in lead [18] and copper [19].\n2. Experiment\nData were collected at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) [20]. A broadspectrum (\u223c 0.2 \u2013 800 MeV) pulsed neutron beam was produced via spallation on a\n\nnat\n\nW\n\ntarget by an 800 MeV proton linear accelerator beam. The average proton beam current\nat the spallation target was about 1 \u2013 2 \u03bcA. The neutron beam structure contained 625-\u03bcs\nlong \"macropulses\" driven by two out of every three such macropulses from the accelerator\nfor an average rate of 40 s\u22121 . Each macropulse consisted of \"micropulses\" spaced every 1.8\n\u03bcs, each < 1 ns long. The pulsed beam allowed incident neutron energies to be determined\nusing the time-of-flight technique. During the argon runs, 6.0 \u00d7 109 micropulses produced\n1.9 \u00d7 1011 neutrons of energies from 1 to 100 MeV on the argon target.\n3\n\n\fThe GErmanium Array for Neutron Induced Excitations (GEANIE) [21] is located 20.34\nm from the spallation target at the Weapons Neutron Research facility (WNR) 60R flight\npath. GEANIE is designed to measure absolute partial cross sections for (n, xn\u03b3) reactions\nby detecting \u03b3 rays from neutron\u2013induced reactions on a target in the center of the array.\nIt comprises 20 HPGe detectors with BGO escape suppression shields. Detectors are either\na planar or coaxial geometry and are typically operated with maximum \u03b3-ray energy ranges\nof 1 MeV and 4 MeV, respectively. Since most of the excited states in\n\n40\n\nAr produce \u03b3 rays\n\nwith energies greater than 1 MeV, the planar detectors were not used. Due to poor energy\nresolution because of neutron damage or other issues which affected the timing, only one\ncoaxial detector (\u03b8 = 77.1\u25e6 relative to the beam axis, \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 ) with the best energy resolution,\npeak-to-background ratio and timing information was used in this analysis.\nThe neutron flux on target was measured with an in-beam fission ionization chamber\nwith 235 U and 238 U foils [22]. The chamber was located about two meters upstream from the\ncenter of the array. Low-energy neutrons that overlap in time from the previous beam pulse\ncontribute up to about 650 keV. Since the first excited state in\n\n40\n\nAr is at 1461 keV, these\n\n\"wrap-around\" neutrons were not a concern for this experiment. The\n\n235\n\nU foil is usually\n\nused to measure the neutron flux at energies less than a few MeV where the 238 U(n, f ) cross\nsection is very small. Since the 238 U foil gives better results at energies above a few MeV, it\nwas used exclusively for this experiment.\nThe argon gas target cell was a 3.81-cm diameter and 6.35-cm length thin-walled aluminum cylinder with 0.127-mm thick Kapton windows at either end. The gas cell was placed\nat the center of the GEANIE array, with the neutron beam passing through the Kapton foils.\nThe nat Ar gas pressure was maintained at about 2.75 atm over the course of the experiment.\nThe diameter of the gas cell was larger than the 1.27-cm beam diameter, yielding an areal\ndensity of approximately 0.5 target atoms per millibarn in the neutron beam. The number\nof atoms in the Kapton foils that the beam passed through was 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mb\u22121 so scattering\nfrom the foils had a negligible effect.\n\n4\n\n\f3. Analysis and Results\n3.1. Cross section analysis\nData were collected with a data acquisition system (DAQ) built around Ortec AD114\nADCs and LeCroy TDCs, with fast readout over a LeCroy FERA bus into a VME memory\nmodule. Slow readout of individual events from the VME memory modules, and subsequent\nonline and offline analysis was performed using code based on the MIDAS [23] DAQ software\nframework. TDC spectra had a gain of 0.5 ns/channel and included data up to about 20\n\u03bcs. A sharp \"\u03b3-flash\" from each proton bunch at the spallation source provided a t = 0\nreference time followed by the fastest neutrons. A time-of-flight spectrum was obtained by\naligning the \u03b3-flashes of consecutive micropulses in a TDC spectrum. The raw TDC and\ntime-of-flight spectra are shown in Figure 1. The resulting time-of-flight spectrum was then\nconverted to neutron energy and re-binned into equal logarithmic neutron energy bins. A\nclock in the data stream triggered by the start of a macropulse ensured that only beam-on\ndata is used for the analysis by excluding \u03b3-ray events that occurred between macropulses.\nPulse height spectra from the HPGe detectors were calibrated to \u03b3-ray energy using\n60\n\nCo and\n\n137\n\n152\n\nEu,\n\nCs source data taken several times during the course of the experiment.\n\nE\u03b3 vs. En histograms were produced for each HPGe detector and fission chamber. The\nneutron energy bins were then projected onto the E\u03b3 axis to produce \u03b3-ray spectra for\na specific neutron energy range. Argon-sample \u03b3-ray spectra selected for specific neutron\nenergy windows are shown in Fig. 2. Fitting peaks in these spectra with a Gaussian function\nand subtracting a linear background gives the \u03b3-ray yield in the specified neutron energy\nbin. The neutron energy spectra were produced using fission chamber data with the same\nneutron energy binning as the \u03b3-ray data so that the \u03b3-ray and fission chamber yields could\nbe directly compared for each neutron energy bin. The neutron flux was determined from\nthe fission chamber data using the same method outlined in Wender et. al. [22].\nData were taken with an evacuated gas cell so that argon transitions could be easily\ndistinguished from background. The background line at 1460.9 keV from 40 K was negligible\ncompared to the argon-sample data. All \u03b3-ray lines present only in the argon sample data\nhave been identified.

Similarly, the 250-keV and 1267-keV transitions observed from\n\n39\n\nAr\n\nwere assumed to have been produced by the 40 Ar(n, 2n\u03b3)39 Ar reaction and not a competing\nreaction channel.\n3.1.1. Live Time\nThe fractional live times were determined by comparing the number of converted pulse\nheight events to the number of ADC scalers. The scalers themselves have essentially no\ndeadtime; they can sustain rates up to 30 kHz with a deadtime < 0.1%. The deadtime\nin the pulser channel was 18% due to ADC conversion and other losses in the electronics.\nThe deadtime in the fission chambers was 45%. Although the deadtime for the HPGe\ndetectors was more significant (> 50 %) due to backgrounds from scattered neutrons and\nthe \u03b3-flash, the beam-induced detector rates were low enough that the energy-dependent\ndeadtime effects were negligible.\n3.1.2. Detection Efficiency\nThe \u03b3-ray detection efficiency (\u01eb\u03b3 ) was measured using 17 \u03b3 rays from\n137\n\n152\n\nEu,\n\n60\n\nCo and\n\nCs point sources each placed in the center of the array. For each \u03b3 ray, the detection\n\nefficiency was calculated using the known source activity, \u03b3-ray branching ratios and measurement live time. These measured efficiencies were fit to derive an efficiency curve for\neach detector. The gas target cell and detectors were also simulated using MaGe [26]; a\nMonte Carlo framework developed by the Majorna and GERDA collaborations based on\nGEANT4 [27, 28]. Mono-energetic \u03b3 rays were generated isotropically in the argon gas in\n10 keV increments from 10 to 4000 keV. The efficiency was calculated for each \u03b3-ray energy\nusing\n\n\u01eb\u03b3 =\n\nNpeak\nNsim\n9\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere Npeak is the number of events in the peak and Nsim is the number of events simulated.\nEnough events were generated for each \u03b3-ray energy so statistical uncertainties were < 1%.\nThe efficiency curves constructed from the simulated data and source data were compared.\nThe simulated efficiency curve was consistent with the fit to the experimental data to within\n6% from 200 \u2013 3200 keV, which includes all \u03b3 rays measured in the current experiment. It\nwas determined from the simulation that the correction due to \u03b3-ray attenuation in the gas\ntarget and aluminum cell was negligible at the gas density used in this experiment.\n3.1.3. Angular Distribution Correction\nSince the incident neutron beam partially aligns the neutron spins in a plane orthogonal\nto the beam direction, the \u03b3 rays are not emitted isotropically by the decaying nucleus, and\nthe angular distribution must be considered [29].\nThe angle-integrated cross section may be calculated from the angular distribution if\nit is known, however a measurement of the angular distribution of \u03b3 rays is not optimal\nwith GEANIE since there are only six unique detector angles in the array. The angular\ndistributions were measured at GEANIE for\n\n238\n\nU(n, xn\u03b3) and deviations from an isotropic\n\nassumption were mostly less than 5% [30]. Because only one detector was used in the\nanalysis, we relied on other measurements and modeling to estimate and correct for angular\ndistribution effects.\nThe AVALANCHE code was used to calculate the angular distribution for all of the\nmeasured transitions [31]. The routines in AVALANCHE were developed to calculate sidefeeding intensities and spin state orientation parameters corresponding to the side-feeding\npart of the m-substate population in compound nucleus reactions [32, 33]. The angular\ndistribution of emitted photons from a nuclear de-excitation may be expanded in terms of\nLegendre polynomials:\n\nW (\u03b8) =\n\nX\n\nAk Pk (cos(\u03b8))\n\n(3)\n\nk=even\n\nwhere the k can only be even due to parity conservation and kmax < 2ji where ji is the spin\nof the excited state [29]. The angular distribution correction factor (C\u03b3 ) was determined by\n10\n\n\fcomparing the angular distribution at a particular angle, \u03b8 to an isotropic assumption (W(\u03b8)\n\u2261 1). The angular distribution correction at a particular incident neutron energy must be\nweighted by each detector's efficiency and live time. The angular distribution correction\nfactor is then given by\nP\n\ni i\ni \u01eb\u03b3 T\u03b3\ni i\ni \u01eb\u03b3 T\u03b3 W (\u03b8i , En )\n\nC\u03b3 (En ) = P\n\n(4)\n\nwhere i runs over all detectors used in the analysis. For the single detector used in the\ncurrent analysis, the correction factor reduces to\nC\u03b3 (En ) =\n\n1\nW (77.1\u25e6, En )\n\n(5)\n\nThe anisotropy diminishes as En increases. C\u03b3 was usually < 1.10 and was a maximum of\n1.18 for the 1460.9-keV transition in\n\n40\n\nAr.\n\n3.2. Cross Sections\nThe \u03b3-ray production cross sections were analyzed using a neutron time-of-flight binning\ncorresponding to 40 equal logarithmic neutron energy bins from 1 to 100 MeV. Although the\nbinning is significantly coarser than the \u223c15-ns timing resolution of the HPGe detectors, it\nproved to be the best choice to generate enough statistics over the measured neutron energy\nrange.\nAs a validation of the experiment and analysis techniques, part of the argon dataset\nwas taken with a 0.127-mm\n\nnat\n\nFe foil fixed to each end window of the gas target and the\n\npartial \u03b3-ray cross section for the 846.8-keV 2+ \u2192 0+ transition in\n\n56\n\nFe was determined.\n\nOur measured cross section was 628 \u00b1 80 mb at En = 15.0 \u00b1 0.9 MeV. This value is in good\nagreement with the cross section of 681 \u00b1 57 mb at En = 14.5 MeV, measured by Nelson\net. al. [34].\nPartial \u03b3-ray cross sections for six transitions in\n\n40\n\nAr and two transitions in\n\n39\n\nAr were\n\nmeasured from threshold to a neutron energy where the \u03b3-ray yield dropped below the\ndetection sensitivity. The results are shown in Figs. 3\u20134 and Tables A.4\u2013A.10. The results\nwere compared to a calculated cross section using the TALYS and CoH3 nuclear reaction\n11\n\n\fcodes [35, 40, 41].\nAlthough there were no features in the \u03b3-ray data near the\n\n76\n\nGe 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 region-of-interest\n\nat 2039 keV and at 3061 keV, which can produce a double-escape peak at 2039 keV, upper\nlimits were calculated using five neutron energy bins from 1 to 100 MeV. The results are\nshown in Table 2.\nTable 2: Upper limits (90% C.L.) for nat Ar(n, xn\u03b3) reactions. The signal region for the\nupper limit calculation was chosen to be a window of 2.8\u03c3, where \u03c3 was determined from\nthe measured detector energy resolution (\u03c3 = 0.77 keV at E\u03b3 = 1333 keV).\nCross section (mb)\nEn (MeV) E\u03b3 = 2039 keV E\u03b3 = 3061 keV\n1.58 \u2013 3.98\n< 50\n< 48\n3.98 \u2013 10.0\n< 76\n< 74\n10.0 \u2013 25.1\n< 64\n< 78\n25.1 \u2013 50.0\n< 50\n< 56\n50.0 \u2013 100\n< 31\n< 31\n\n3.3. Systematic Uncertainties\nAn uncertainty of 6%, assigned to \u03b3-ray detection efficiency, was derived from the uncertainty in the fit to experimental data over the measured \u03b3-ray energy range. This is\nconsistent with the results from the Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty in the number of argon atoms was 4%, mainly due to pressure changes in the gas cell over the course of\nthe experiment. An uncertainty of 2 \u2013 4% was assigned to the neutron flux due to the uncertainty in the\n\n238\n\nU(n, f ) cross sections. The uncertainty in the neutron energy was based\n\non the time-of-flight cut on the fission chamber data. The angular distributions of \u03b3 rays\nwere presented for several excited states in the\n\n40\n\nAr(n, n\u2032 \u03b3)40 Ar reaction at En = 3.5 MeV\n\nby Mathur and Morgan [17]. The angular distribution data for the 2+ \u2192 0+ first excited\nstate compared with the angular distribution calculated using the AVALANCHE code is\nshown in Figure 5. Based on the maximum deviation from the AVALANCHE calculation\nand data, a systematic uncertainty in the angular distribution correction of 4% was adopted.\nAn angular distribution correction was not applied to the cross section for the E\u03b3 = 660 keV\n12\n\n\f1.2\n\nCross section (barns)\n\n1.4\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.18\n\nCross section (barns)\n\n0.16\n\n(a) 40Ar, 2+ \u2192 0+, E\u03b3 = 1461 keV\nGEANIE\nMathur and Morgan\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n30\n\n0.14\n0.12\n\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n2\n\n4\n\n0.25\n\n(c) 40Ar, 2+ \u2192 0+, E\u03b3 = 2524 keV\nGEANIE\nMathur and Morgan\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n0.16\n\n(b) 40Ar, 0+ \u2192 2+, E\u03b3 = 660 keV\nGEANIE\nMathur and Morgan\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n0.14\n\n0\n0\n\n35\n\nCross section (barns)\n\nCross section (barns)\n\n1.6\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\n6\n\n8\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n(d) 40Ar, 2+ \u2192 2+, E\u03b3 = 1063 keV\nGEANIE\nMathur and Morgan\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0\n0\n\n14\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n(e) 40Ar, 4+ \u2192 2+, E\u03b3 = 1432 keV\nGEANIE\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n6\n\n8\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n(f) 40Ar, 2+ \u2192 2+, E\u03b3 = 1747 keV\nGEANIE\nMathur and Morgan\nTALYS 1.2\nCoH3\n\n0.18\n\nCross section (barns)\n\nCross section (barns)\n\n0.6\n\n8\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFigure 3: Partial \u03b3-ray cross sections for 40 Ar(n, n\u2032 \u03b3)40 Ar.

Discussion and Conclusions\nWe chose to use a single detector in the final analysis based on overall performance during\nthe course of the experiment. Because the detector used in the cross section analysis had\none of the best beam-on peak-to-background ratios in the array, the statistical uncertainty\nusing this analysis was adequate and we reached a comparable sensitivity to previous cross\nsections measured at GEANIE. Because these reactions have a relatively high threshold and\nthe density of states is low it is unlikely that additional cross sections from higher excited\nstates would have been measured with more analyzed detectors.\nThe TALYS reaction code was used to predict the \u03b3-ray production cross sections for\nthe transitions studied in the present work. The TALYS cross sections were calculated using\nthe default settings, which included a direct reaction model using the local optical model\nparameterization of Koning and Delaroche [37], a pre-equilibrium model and a compound\nnucleus reaction model using a Hauser-Feshbach statistical calculation. The TALYS cross\nsections tend to under-predict the measured cross sections.\nIn addition to the TALYS calculations, we performed \u03b3-ray production cross section\ncalculations with the CoH3 code [40, 41], which is similar to TALYS - using a HauserFeshbach statistical model and a pre-equilibrium model. The statistical model calculations\nin the relatively light mass region, such as for argon, require careful selection of the discrete levels included, because the nuclear structure and the \u03b3-ray decay scheme significantly\nimpact the calculated \u03b3-ray production cross sections. For example, in the\n\n40\n\nAr case, the\n\ndiscrete states up to about 4.5 MeV are known in the nuclear structure database including\nthe \u03b3-ray branching ratios from each level.\nFirst, we reviewed the nuclear structure information on\n\n40\n\nAr in the database RIPL-\n\n3 [42] and eliminated three discrete states that are uncertain. The discrete states up to\n4.2 MeV are included in our calculation, and the continuum state is assumed above that\nenergy. At higher energies the direct population of collective levels is very important for\nthe \u03b3-ray production cross section calculation. We take \u03b22 = 0.251 for the 1.461 MeV 2+\nand \u03b23 = 0.314 for the 3.681 MeV 3\u2212 state from RIPL-3, and the DWBA calculation is\n16\n\n\fperformed to these levels.\nThe Koning and Delaroche global optical potential [37] was used for the neutron and\nproton transmission coefficient calculation. The \u03b1-particle optical potential was taken from\nthe parameterization of Avrigeanu et al. [43]. This optical potential is valid for A > 50 and\n40\n\nAr is slightly outside the range. However, the (n, \u03b1) cross section on\n\n40\n\nAr is small (20 mb\n\nat 10 MeV), the extrapolation of this optical potential is not crucial for our\n\n40\n\nAr(n, n\u2032 \u03b3)\n\nreaction. The Koning-Delaroche optical potential was first tested against experimental total\ncross section data in the energy range 1\u201330 MeV, and we obtained good agreement with the\ndata of Winters et al. [44].\nSince the Koning and Delaroche potential is also used in the TALYS default setup calculation, we expect that the two calculations are not so different. The difference in the \u03b3-ray\nproduction cross section partly comes from the different modeling of the level density [45],\nbut largely due to the discrete levels included. When some tentative level assignments exist\nin the evaluated level scheme, it is often assumed that these levels decay to the ground state\ndirectly, which results in underestimation of measured \u03b3-ray production cross sections.\nIn experiments like DEAP/CLEAN, the most worrisome neutrons come from\n232\n\n238\n\nU and\n\nTh-induced (\u03b1, n) reactions in detector and shielding components, specifically in borosil-\n\nicate PMT glass. The\n\n238\n\nU and\n\n232\n\nTh-induced (\u03b1, n) neutron energy spectrum peaks at\n\nabout 3\u20135 MeV and is negligible above 8 MeV [38]. If both the neutron elastic and \u03b3-ray\nproduction (inelastic) cross sections are known in this energy range, the elastic neutron\nscattering background may be estimated by measuring the inelastic scattering rate in the\ndetector and comparing the relative sizes of the cross sections. The ratio of the elastic to\ninelastic neutron scattering cross sections for\n\n40\n\nAr from 1.5 to 10 MeV are shown in Fig. 6.\n\nThe elastic scattering cross section was calculated using the local optical model parameterization of Koning and Delaroche [37] within the TALYS framework. The data points\nare the measured \u03b3-ray production cross section summed over all levels observed in the\ncurrent experiment. Although the ratio of the cross sections becomes large as the neutron\nenergy approaches threshold, only about 15% of the total neutrons produced from 238 U and\n232\n\nTh-induced (\u03b1, n) reactions have energies below 2 MeV.\n17\n\n\fCross section (barns)\n\n3.5\n\n(a)\n40\n\nAr(n,n)40Ar\nData 40Ar(n,n'\u03b3 )40Ar\nCoH3 40Ar(n,n'\u03b3 )40Ar\n\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nEn (MeV)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n(a) The solid curve is the elastic scattering cross section for neutrons incident on 40 Ar, calculated\nfrom the local optical model parameters of Koning and Delaroche.

Cross sections for\nsix excited states of 40 Ar, assumed to be from the 40 Ar(n, n\u2032 \u03b3)40 Ar reaction, were measured.\nTwo cross sections from excited states of\n\n39\n\nAr, assumed to be from the\n\n40\n\nAr(n, 2n\u03b3)39 Ar\n\nreaction, were also measured. Although there was no statistically significant signal in the\nregions relevant to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 in 76 Ge, upper limits were placed on 40 Ar(n, xn\u03b3) cross sections for\n1 < En < 100 MeV. The measured cross sections and upper limits can be included in Monte\nCarlo simulations combined with the expected neutron spectrum to yield background rates\nfor future low-background experiments that will use argon as a detector or shield material. The measured cross sections will also aid in the discrimination of neutron backgrounds\nWIMP detection experiments which use argon as a detector, where neutrons are the most\ndangerous source of background.\n5.
