Unpolarized cross section results are\ngiven for transverse momenta pT = 0.5 to 20 GeV/c, extending the range of published data to both\nlower and higher pT . The cross section is described well for pT < 1 GeV/c by an exponential in\npT , and, for pT > 2 GeV/c, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented\nbased on a factor of five improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results,\ndue to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These\nmeasurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton, and exclude maximal values for\nthe gluon polarization.\nPACS numbers: 13.85.Ni,13.88.+e,21.10.Hw,25.40.Ep\n\nA principal goal of the spin program at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory is to determine the gluon spin contribution to a\nlongitudinally polarized proton (\u2206G), taking advantage\nof the strongly interacting probes available in protonproton collisions [1]. Previous measurements have established the validity of the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) description for inclusive mid-rapidity\n\u03c0 0 [2] and forward \u03c0 0 production [3], and for mid-rapidity\n\u221a\njet [4] and direct photon production [5], at s = 200\nGeV. The double helicity asymmetries for the production of these particles involve gluons in the hard scattering processes in this pQCD description, and the first\nmeasurements for \u03c0 0 [6, 7] and for jets [4] have begun to\nprobe \u2206G.\nThe RHIC beam polarization and luminosity have significantly improved [8]. The statistical uncertainty for a\ndouble helicity asymmetry\n\u221a measurement is proportional\nto the inverse of P 2 \u00d7 L for beam polarizations P and\nintegrated luminosity L, and decreased by a factor of 5\nfrom the previously published data from PHENIX [6, 7].\nIn this paper, we first present the cross section for midrapidity \u03c0 0\u221aproduction for unpolarized proton-proton collisions at s = 200 GeV. These results extend to lower\nand higher pT than in previous publications, and we discuss an apparent transition region between soft and hard\nscattering; the inclusive cross section is dominated by\nhard scattering, described by pQCD, for pT > 2 GeV/c.\nWe then present the double helicity asymmetry, ALL , for\nmid-rapidity \u03c0 0 production. We also include measurements of ALL at low pT , below the hard scattering region.\nFinally, our results for pT > 2 GeV/c are compared to\na pQCD calculation that incorporates a model of gluon\npolarization. We present the range that we probe in the\ngluon momentum fraction (xg ) and discuss the constraint\nfrom these data on \u2206G.\nThe PHENIX experiment at RHIC measured \u03c0 0 's via\n0\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays using a highly segmented (\u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u223c\n0.01\u00d70.01) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) [9], covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 0.35 and azimuthal\nangle range of \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0. The \u03c0 0 data in this analysis were collected using two different trigger conditions.\n\n\u2217 PHENIX\n\u2020 Deceased\n\nSpokesperson: jacak@skipper.physics.sunysb.edu\n\nA minimum bias (MB) trigger was defined by the coincidence of signals in two beam-beam counters (BBC)\nwith full azimuthal coverage located at pseudorapidities\n\u00b1(3.0 \u2212 3.9) [10]. The cross section for events selected by\ninel\nthe MB trigger was 23.0 mb (about half of \u03c3pp\n) with a\nsystematic uncertainty of \u00b19.7% , derived from vernier\nscan results [2] and the variation of MB trigger efficiency\nfor subsequent years. Higher pT data were collected using\nthe coincidence of the MB trigger and an EMCal-based\nhigh pT photon trigger [2, 11], with efficiency \u223c 5% at\npT (\u03c0 0 ) \u223c 1 GeV/c and \u223c 90% for pT (\u03c0 0 ) > 3.5 GeV/c.\nThe collision vertex was required to be within |z| < 30\ncm along the beam axis, based on the time difference\nbetween the two BBC detectors. The \u03c0 0 acceptance is\nuniform over this interval. The analyzed data sample of\nthe 2005 run corresponds to an integrated luminosity of\n2.5 pb\u22121 .\nDetails of the unpolarized cross section analysis technique are described in [2, 11]. The background contribution under the \u03c0 0 peak in the two-photon invariant\nmass distribution varied from 80% in the lowest 0.5\u20130.75\nGeV/c pT bin to less than 8% for pT > 4 GeV/c. The\n\u03c0 0 spectrum was corrected for overlapping decay photon\nshowers in the EMCal, based on Monte Carlo simulations\nconfirmed with test beam data [12]. Below a pT (\u03c0 0 ) of 12\nGeV/c the correction is less than 4%, and for pT (\u03c0 0 ) = 20\nGeV/c the correction is \u223c25% and \u223c70%, for two different EMCal subsystems [9]. The systematic uncertainty of\nthe measurement (excluding the 9.7% uncertainty from\nthe MB trigger cross section) varied from \u223c 7% at pT \u223c 1\nGeV/c to \u223c 16% for the highest pT bin.\nFigure 1 presents the cross\n\u221a section results for midrapidity \u03c0 0 production at s = 200 GeV, versus pT ,\nfrom pT =0.5 GeV/c to pT =20 GeV [13]. Points are\nplotted at the average pT for each bin. The pQCD\nprediction, at next-to-leading order, is shown for theory scales \u03bc = pT /2, pT and 2pT , where \u03bc represents\nequal factorization, renormalization, and fragmentation\nscales [14, 15]. The CTEQ6M parton distribution functions [16] and KKP set of fragmentation functions [17]\nare used. These data extend the published cross section\ndata at both low and high pT , and are consistent with\npreviously published results [2, 11]. From pT =2 GeV/c\nto 20 GeV/c, the NLO pQCD calculation describes the\ndata over a change in cross section of seven orders of\nmagnitude.\n\n\f1\n10-1\n-2\n\n10\n\n\u03c00\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n10\n\n(\u03c0++\u03c0-)/2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n10\n\n3\n\nE*d \u03c3/dp (mb\u22c5GeV -2\u22c5c3)\n\n102\n\n3\n\n3\n\n102\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10-4\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5\n\n-5\n\n10\n\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10-7\n-8\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n10\n(Data-pQCD)/pQCD\n\nThe inset to Fig. 1 shows the lower pT region in more\ndetail including high precision data for the charged pion\ncross section from [18]. The data show a transition in the\npT dependence of the cross section, from exponential to\na power law dependence, in the region pT \u22481\u20132 GeV/c.\nIn order to estimate possible contamination from nonperturbative physics in the higher pT data, an exponential function (\u223c e\u2212\u03b1pT ) representing a non-perturbative\ncomponent, is fit to the charged pion spectrum in the\nregion pT =0.3 to 0.8 GeV/c (only the lowest pT \u03c0 0 data\npoint is in this range) and extrapolated to the higher\npT region. The exponential fit for the low pT region\ngives \u03b1 = 5.56\u00b10.02 (GeV/c)\u22121 , with \u03c72 /N DF = 6.2/3.\nOnly statistical uncertainties for the charged pion data\nwere used in the fit. The dominant systematic uncertainty for the points in the fitted pT range is a \u223c 12%\nnormalization uncertainty (excluding the normalization\nuncertainty from the MB trigger cross section). Beyond\nabout pT =1 GeV/c, the data lie above this single exponential. The fraction of the exponential contribution to\nthe data for the 2\u20132.5 GeV/c pT bin is found to be less\nthan 10%, with a negligible contribution for higher pT .\nThis is the basis for applying the pQCD formalism to the\ndouble helicity asymmetry data with pT > 2 GeV/c.\nFor the 2005 run, each collider ring of RHIC was filled\nwith up to 111 bunches in a 120 bunch pattern, spaced\n106 ns apart, with predetermined patterns of polarization signs for the bunches. Spin rotators, sets of four\nhelical dipole magnets on each side of PHENIX, rotate\nthe polarization orientation from vertical, the stable spin\ndirection in the RHIC arcs, to longitudinal at the interaction point [19]. Beam helicity asymmetries are obtained by tagging the polarization signs of the bunches\nfor each event. The bunches for one beam alternate in\npolarization sign, and pairs of bunches alternate in sign\nfor the other beam. In this way data for all combinations of beam helicity are collected at the same time,\nand the possibility of false asymmetries due to changing\ndetector response versus spin state are greatly reduced.\nEach RHIC fill, typically lasting 8 hours, used one of four\nbunch spin patterns.\nThe beam polarizations for 2005 were measured using\nfast carbon target polarimeters [20], normalized by absolute polarization measurements made during 2005 by a\nseparate polarized atomic hydrogen jet polarimeter [21].\nThe beam polarizations, from luminosity-weighted\naverages over 104 RHIC fills used in the analysis, were\nhP B i=0.50\u00b10.002(stat)\u00b10.025(systB)\u00b10.015(systG)\nand hP Y i=0.49\u00b10.002(stat)\u00b10.025(systY)\u00b10.015(systG),\nfor \"Blue\" and \"Yellow\" RHIC beams, respectively, for\nthe bunches colliding at PHENIX. The systematic\nuncertainties have been separated into uncorrelated\nuncertainties for each beam, \"systB\" and \"systY\", and a\nglobal systematic uncertainty \"systG\", which is common\nfor both beams and comes from systematic uncertainty\nin jet polarimeter measurements [22].

The bottom panel shows the\nrelative difference between the data and theory for the three\ntheory scales. Error bars are quadratic sums of experimental\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties (the 9.7% normalization uncertainty is not included).\n\nduction (production angle 0.3\u20132.5 mrad) [6, 23] were used\nto set up and monitor the beam polarization orientation\nat PHENIX. The polarimeters monitor the transverse polarization of each beam at PHENIX, which can be compared to the beam polarization measured by the RHIC\npolarimeters where the polarization direction is vertical.\nThe local polarimeters were calibrated by turning off the\nspin rotators around PHENIX, and measuring the response of the local polarimeters with the beams vertically polarized. For the longitudinal polarization data,\nthe beams showed a measurable transverse polarization,\nwith (PT /P )B =0.10\u00b10.02 and (PT /P )Y = 0.14 \u00b1 0.02,\nwith PT /P referring to the fraction of transverse polarization of each beam. The polarization directions, as\ndetermined by the spin rotator settings and as measured\nby the local polarimeters, remained constant over the\nrun. The product of the beam polarizations P B * P Y\n\n\f5\n\n0\n\nA\u03c0LL =\n\n1\nN++ \u2212 R * N+\u2212\n;\n*\nB\nY\n|P * P | N++ + R * N+\u2212\n\nR=\n\n\u03b4 stat ALL . Therefore, a limit was determined for the AT T\ncontribution to ALL of 0.07 * \u03b4 stat ALL .\n\nALL\n\nis required for the double helicity asymmetry measurement. The average transverse component of the product was hPTB * PTY i/hP B * P Y i < (PT /P )B * (PT /P )Y =\n0.014 \u00b1 0.003; the average of the polarization product\nover the run was hP B * P Y i = 0.24 with a systematic\nuncertainty of \u00b19.4%.\nThe double helicity asymmetry ALL is the difference\nof cross sections for the same versus opposite beam helicities, divided by the sum. Experimentally, for inclusive\n\u03c0 0 production, it can be determined as:\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\nL++\n, (1)\nL+\u2212\n\nwhere N is the number of \u03c0 0 's measured in PHENIX\nfrom the colliding bunches with the same (++) and opposite (+\u2212) helicities, and R is the relative luminosity\nbetween bunches with the same and opposite helicities.\nHere we neglect the parity-violating difference in cross\nsection between (++) \u2194 (\u2212\u2212) and (+\u2212) \u2194 (\u2212+) beam\nhelicity configurations [24]. ALL was calculated for each\nfill in order to reduce systematics from variation in beam\npolarizations and in R for different fills. Even and odd\ncrossings were handled by separate high pT photon trigger electronics chains. To avoid possible detector bias,\nALL was also determined separately for the even and odd\ncrossings. Final asymmetries were averaged, and corrected for the asymmetry of the background under the\n\u03c0 0 peak in the two-photon mass distribution, as in [6].\nThe relative luminosity ratio R is obtained from the\nminimum bias triggers (MB) discussed above. Scalers\nkeep track of the number of live triggers for each bunch\ncrossing. Single beam background was < 0.05%, as measured from non-colliding bunches, and contributes negligible systematic uncertainty to the measured R. We\nalso measured the double helicity asymmetry of the relative luminosity scaler counts, by normalizing using zero\ndegree neutral particle production as measured by zero\ndegree calorimeters (ZDC) [25]. No asymmetry was observed. This gave a limit on an asymmetry bias in the\n0\nmeasurement of \u03b4A\u03c0LL |bias < 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and a limit on\nthe systematic uncertainty for the measurement of rela0\ntive luminosity giving \u03b4A\u03c0LL |R < 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . These limits\nalso include the effects from the pileup of two or more\ncollisions in a crossing, calculated at <\n\u223c 4% of the crossings. The BBC and ZDC monitors observe the pileup\nat significantly different rates, and therefore the limits\nabove, from comparing BBC and ZDC counts, include\nthese uncertainties.\nA transverse double spin asymmetry AT T , the transverse equivalent to Eq. (1), can contribute to ALL\nthrough the 1.4% transverse component of the product of\nthe beam polarizations discussed above. Although AT T\nhas been postulated to be extremely small, \u223c 10\u22124 [26],\nit has not been previously measured. We measured AT T\nin a short run with transverse polarization. AT T (pT ) was\nconsistent with zero within statistical errors [13]; the errors were 5 times larger than the uncertainties for ALL ,\n\n\u2206 G=G\n\n0.05\n\n\u2206 G=-G\n\n0.02\n\nstd\n\n0.01\n\n\u2206 G=0\n\n0\n-0.01\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\nFIG. 2: The\n\u221a double helicity asymmetry for neutral pion production at s = 200 GeV as a function of pT (GeV/c). Error\nbars are statistical uncertainties, with the 9.4% scale uncertainty not shown; other experimental systematic uncertainties\nare negligible. Four GRSV theoretical calculations based on\nNLO pQCD are also shown for comparison with the data (see\ntext for details.)\n\nFigure 2 presents the measured double helicity asymmetry in \u03c0 0 production [13]. A scale uncertainty of 9.4%\n0\nin A\u03c0LL due to the uncertainty in beam polarization is not\nshown. The other systematic uncertainties are negligible,\nas discussed above, and checked using a bunch polarization sign randomization technique, and by varying the \u03c0 0\nidentification criteria [6]. Data for pT > 1 GeV/c were\nobtained from the high pT photon triggered sample. For\npT below 1 GeV/c, due to low efficiency for the high pT\nphoton trigger, we used the MB data sample. In the low\npT region, where the cross section shows an exponential\n0\nbehavior, the helicity asymmetry is A\u03c0LL =0.002\u00b10.002,\nfor the data in the range pT = 0.5 \u2212 1 GeV/c. For the\nhigher pT region, the four curves in Fig. 2 show calcula0\ntions of A\u03c0LL , using NLO pQCD with \u03bc = pT (\u03c0 0 ), that\nreflect the range of gluon polarizations allowed by inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data. The calculations are based on the GRSV model, where \"std\" was\nthe best fit to inclusive DIS data [27]. For momentum\nfraction x, \u2206G(x) = G+ (x) \u2212 G\u2212 (x) refers to the gluon\nhelicity distribution, and G+ (x) and G\u2212 (x) refer to the\ngluon densities for + and \u2212 helicities in a + helicity proton. The first moment of the gluon helicity distribution,\nR1\n\u2206G(x)dx, for the \"std\" parameterization is \u2206G=0.4,\n0\n\nat the scale Q2 =1 GeV2 . The other three curves are cal-\n\n\fculations based on this best fit, but use at Q2 = 0.4 GeV2\nthe function \u2206G(x) = G(x), 0, \u2212G(x), where G(x) is the\nunpolarized gluon distribution. The gluon distribution\nat the input scale is evolved to the scale Q2 = p2T (\u03c0 0 ).\nIn order to explore the impact of the new data on the\nsensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution, we have\ncompared the data with a set of ALL (pT ) curves corresponding to different \u2206G(x) between \u2206G(x) = \u2212G(x)\nand \u2206G(x) = G(x) at Q2 = 0.4 GeV2 . We used the\ndata for pT > 2 GeV/c, which appear to have little contamination from soft physics as discussed earlier. The\nmost likely xg for PHENIX \u03c0 0 data\n\u221a in each pT point is\n\u223c xT /0.8 [30], where xT = pT /( s/2). For the measured pT range 2\u20139 GeV/c, the range of xg in each bin is\nbroad, and spans the range xg = 0.02 \u2212 0.3, as calculated\nby NLO pQCD [31].\nFigure 3 shows the corresponding \u03c72 versus\nx=[0.02\u21920.3]\n, where we compare to an integral\n\u2206GGRSV\nof \u2206G over the probed xg range. Only experimental\nstatistical uncertainties are used to calculate \u03c72 , and no\ntheoretical uncertainties are included. It is important\nto note, that although the range of the first moment\nexplored represents \u223c 60% of the full integral, this\nreflects using a specific model for the gluon polarization.\nFor example, a gluon polarization model with a crossover\nfrom positive to negative gluon polarization within our\nxg range would yield a small average asymmetry for each\npoint. Also, other models can generate larger or smaller\ncontributions from the gluon spin in the unmeasured\nregion of xg .\nThese data are sensitive to the first moment of the\npolarized gluon distribution. Using the GRSV model,\nwe find that the gluon polarization contribution to the\nproton spin (1/2) in the probed xg range is constrained\nbetween \u22120.9 and +0.5, for \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min =9, representing\na \"3\u03c3\" limit (a \"1\u03c3\" limit would give a constraint between 0.07 and 0.3). The extremes of gluon polarization\nare ruled out, modulo the above remarks, with the confidence level for \"\u2206G = \u00b1G\" of less than 10\u22126 . Large\npositive gluon polarization [28] was proposed shortly after the discovery that the quark contribution to the proton spin was small [29], with the suggestion that such a\nlarge gluon polarization would mask a \"bare\" quark polarization. For \"std\" and \"\u2206G = 0\", the confidence levels are 20\u201321% and 12\u201313%, respectively, for the range\nof \u00b19.4% scale uncertainty of the measurement. Semiinclusive DIS measurements [32] have also presented\ndata on \u2206G in a limited xg range and its comparison\nwith various \u2206G scenarios.\nThe two minima in Fig. 3 reflect the quadratic contribution of the gluon polarization to ALL , from the gluongluon scattering subprocess for \u03c0 0 production. The symmetry between the two minima is broken by the quarkgluon scattering subprocess, where the gluon polarization\ncontributes linearly to ALL . The quark-gluon subprocess\nis emphasized at higher pT , which will become accessible\nwith additional running at high polarization and luminosity.\n\n\u03c72\n\n6\n\n24\n\nx=[0.02 \u2192 0.3]\n\n\u2206 GGRSV\n\n22\n\nx=[0 \u2192 1]\n\n~ 0.6 \u2206 GGRSV\n\nNo theoretical uncertainties\nincluded\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10 \"\u2206G=-G\"\n\n\"\u2206G=0\" \"std\"\n\n\"\u2206G=G\"\n\n8\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nx=[0.02 \u2192 0.3]\n\n\u2206GGRSV\n\n1\n2\n\n(Q =1 GeV2)\n\nFIG. 3: The \u03c72 distribution of the measured data plotted\nversus the value of the first moment of the polarized gluon\ndistribution (solid line) in the xg range from 0.02 to 0.3 corresponding to our \u03c0 0 data in pT bins from 2 to 9 GeV/c.\nDashed and dotted lines correspond to \u22129.4% and +9.4%\nvariation in ALL normalization related to the beam polarization uncertainty, the dominant systematical uncertainty of\nour data. Only statistical uncertainties were used for each\ncurve. Arrows indicate \u2206G corresponding to the different\npolarized gluon distributions discussed in the text.\n\nTo summarize, we have presented the unpolarized\ncross section and double helicity asymmetries for \u03c0 0 production\nat mid-rapidity, for proton-proton collisions at\n\u221a\ns = 200 GeV. We observe an apparent transition region in the cross section, for pT \u22481 to 2 GeV/c, with\nthe cross section described by an exponential in pT below pT \u223c 1 GeV/c, and with the cross section described\nby the pQCD prediction for pT = 2 to 20 GeV/c, over\nseven orders of magnitude in cross section. The results\nfor ALL in the pQCD region, which we take as pT \u2265 2\nGeV/c, constrain the gluon polarization in the proton\nsignificantly. The range probed is xg = 0.02 to 0.3, for\nthe gluon momentum fraction. Using one representative\nmodel for the gluon polarization, GRSV [27], which assumes no crossover in gluon polarization versus xg , we\npresent a map of \u03c72 versus the first moment of the polarized gluon distribution in the measured region. From this\nstudy, the present data rule out extreme values of gluon\npolarization suggested after the surprise of the EMC result that the quarks (and anti-quarks) contribute little\nto the spin of the proton [29], but allow significant contribution from the gluon spin to the proton spin.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the RHIC Polarimeter Group and the staff\nof the Collider-Accelerator and Physics Departments at\nBNL for their vital contributions.
