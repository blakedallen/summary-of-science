The only assumption\non the graph is that each vertex has at most D(G) adjacent vertices (edges)\nfor some D(G) < \u221e. So the graph G is either finite, or infinite with bounded\ndegree. Special cases are infinite lattices.\nCall two vertices v, v \u2032 adjacent (v \u223c v \u2032 in symbols) if there exists an edge,\ndenoted by {v, v \u2032 } = {v \u2032 , v}, connecting them.

The edge-reinforced random\nwalk on G records a random motion of a particle along the vertices of G with\nthe following properties:\n(i) if currently at vertex v \u2208 G, in the next step, the particle jumps to a\nvertex in A(v);\n(ii) the probability of a jump to v \u2032 is W -proportional to the number of\nprevious traversals of the edge {v, v \u2032 }.\n\nMore precisely, let the initial edge weights be X0e \u2208 N for all e \u2208 E. We\nassume throughout the paper that supe X0e < \u221e.\nLet In be a V -valued random variable, recording the position of the particle at time n, n \u2265 0. For concreteness, set I0 = v0 for some v0 \u2208 V . A traversal\nof edge e occurs at time n + 1 if e = {In , In+1 }. Denote by Xne \u2212 X0e the total number of traversals of edge e until time n. Let Fn be the filtration\n\u03c3{(Ik , Xke , e \u2208 E), k = 0, . . . , n} = \u03c3{Ik , k = 0, . . . , n, (X0e , e \u2208 E)}.\nThe edge-reinforced random walk on G with weight function W is a Markov\nchain (I, X) = {(In , Xne , e \u2208 E), n \u2265 0} on state space V (G) \u00d7 NE with the\nfollowing conditional transition probabilities: on the event {In = v}, for\nv \u2032 \u2208 A(v),\n\u2032\n\nP (In+1 = v ,\n\ne\nXn+1\n\n= Xne + 1{e={v,v\u2032 }} , e \u2208 G | Fn ) =\n\n{v,v\u2032 }\n\nW (Xn\nP\n\n)\n\n{v,w}\n)\nw\u2208A(v) W (Xn\n\n(1)\nIt is easily seen that the edge-reinforced random walk is well defined for\nany weight function W , where W (k) > 0, k \u2208 N. Let (H0) be the following\ncondition on W :\nX 1\n(H0)\n< \u221e.\nW (k)\nk\u2208N\nLet us make a few preliminary observations. A simple calculation shows\nthat (H0) is the necessary and sufficient condition for\nP ({In , In+1 } = {I0 , I1 } for all n) > 0,\nso that an attracting edge exists with positive probability. This implies that\n(H0) is necessary and sufficient to have\nP (walk is attracted to a single edge) > 0,\nand a variation of the above argument also implies that\nP (walk is attracted to a finite subgraph) = 1.\nHowever, it can easily be shown that if k 1/W (k) = \u221e and W is nondecreasing, then any edge adjacent to an edge traversed by the walk infinitely\noften must also be traversed infinitely often.\nP\n\n.\n\n\fSTRONGLY EDGE REINFORCED WALKS\n\n3\n\nThe case G = Z has been studied by Davis in [1], who has proven that\nif (H0) does not hold and W is nondecreasing, then, with probability 1,\nevery vertex in Z is visited by the walk infinitely often, that is, the walk\nis recurrent. This statement has, in fact, no proven general counterpart for\nother infinite graphs: even the original recurrence/transience question raised\nby Coppersmith and Diaconis [2] in 1986 for W linear and G = Zd , d \u2265 2, is\nstill open. For recent results on linearly ERRW, see [4, 6]. Sellke [7] provided\nexamples of W not nondecreasing and not satisfying the condition (H0) such\nthat for the corresponding reinforced walk, an attractor consisting of two or\nmore edges exists with positive (or full) probability on Z, as well as on other\ngraphs.\nIn the case where (H0) holds, the first result is due to Davis [1], who\nproved that on Z, there exists almost surely some random integer i such\nthat the walk visits only i and i + 1 at all large times. Sellke [7] generalized\nthis statement and showed that, if G = Zd , d \u2265 1, then under the necessary\nassumption (H0) (without any monotonicity requirement), there exists almost surely some random attracting edge, which is traversed by the walk at\nall large times. The same paper contains the conjecture that the above property holds for edge-reinforced random walks on general graphs of bounded\ndegree.\nThe argument developed by Sellke [7] carries over to the setting where G\nis any graph of bounded degree without odd cycles, a fact used by Limic [3].\nIn [3], it was proven that on any graph of bounded degree, the attracting\nedge exists with probability 1 if W (k) = k\u03c1 for \u03c1 > 1. In this paper, we\nshow a generalization of this result to a large class of weight functions W ,\nincluding the class of nondecreasing weights satisfying (H0), making use of\nthe techniques developed by the authors in [3, 8] and [9].\nA cycle C in G of length |C| is a subgraph of G spanned by a |C|-tuple of vertices (v1 , v2 , . . . , v|C| ), such that {vi , vi+1 } \u2208 E, i = 1, . . . , |C| \u2212 1, {v|C| , v1 } \u2208\nE, and vi 6= vj if i 6= j.\nFor each n \u2208 N, let\n\u03b1n :=\n\u03b4n :=\n\n1\n,\n2\nW\n(k)\nk\u2265n\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=n+1\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n.\nW (k) W (k \u2212 1)\n\nLet\n\u03bd(G) :=\n\nG \u2032 \u2282G\n\nsup\nodd cycle\n\n\u221a\n\n2|G \u2032 |,\n\nwith the convention that \u03bd(G) = 0 if there are no odd cycles. Note that if\nthere are odd cycles of arbitrarily large length in G, then \u03bd(G) = \u221e.\n\n\f4\n\nV. LIMIC AND P.

It implies, in particular, that if W is\nnondecreasing and (H0) holds, then G\u221e has only one edge almost surely.\nThis statement is shown in Corollary 3 below, based on the observation that\nif (H1) does not hold and W is nondecreasing, then W belongs to a fairly\nlarge class of weights (affectionately called the sticky weights), given by the\ncondition\n\u0012\n\u0013X\n1\n(H2)\n< \u221e,\nlim inf max W (j)\nn\u2192\u221e 0\u2264j<n\nW\n(k)\nk\u2265n\nfor which the attracting edge property is shown in Lemma 2 below.

Proof of Theorem 1. This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1. The following proposition follows from results of [3] and [7].\nProposition 5. Assume that ( H0) holds. Then, almost surely, G\u221e is\neither a cycle of odd length or a single edge.\nProof. The arguments of Section 2 in [3] apply here verbatim, but for\nthe benefit of the reader, we provide more details. Recall that we assume\nthroughout the paper that each vertex has at most D(G) adjacent vertices\nfor some D(G) < \u221e, that is, that the graph is of bounded degree. Define\nby G1 the subgraph of G spanned by the edges visited at least once by the\nwalk. We know from [7], Lemma 4, that G1 , and therefore G\u221e , is a finite\ngraph. First, [7], Theorem 3 (alternatively, [3], Lemma 1), shows that there\nis a.s. no even cycle contained in G\u221e and that if G\u221e is a tree, it a.s. only\nconsists of two vertices and one edge connecting them. Second, [3], Lemma\n2, says that there is at most one odd cycle contained in G\u221e , almost surely.\nThird, [3], Corollary 1, says that with probability 1, G\u221e contains no vertex of\ndegree \u2265 3. Therefore, with probability 1, either G\u221e contains an odd cycle,\nin which case it is exactly equal to this cycle, or it is a single edge. \u0003\n\n\f8\n\nV. LIMIC AND P. TARR\u00c8S\n\nNow, the event {G\u221e is an odd cycle} is a union of at most countably\nmany events\n(6)\n\n{G\u221e is an odd cycle C},\n\nwhere C is any fixed odd cycle in G. Therefore, it suffices to prove that each\nevent above happens with probability 0. Moreover, as observed in [3], if the\nedge-reinforced random walk on G stays within a finite cycle C of length l\nstarting from some time n0 , at which the current edge weights on the edges\nof C are given by z1 , . . . , zl , then its transition probabilities starting from\ntime n0 (and therefore its law, and asymptotic behavior) are identical to\nthose of the edge-reinforced random walk on the cycle of length l started\nfrom the initial configuration of edge weights z1 , . . . , zl . Since the event in\n(6) is a countable union over all finite times n0 and all finite configurations\nz1 , . . . , zl , it is sufficient to prove the following proposition.\nProposition 6. Let G be a cycle of length l, where l is an odd number.\nAssume that (H0) holds and that\n1\n\u03b4n\n1\n=\u221a .\nlim inf \u221a < \u221a\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03b1n\n2|G|\n2l\nThen for any choice of initial condition X0e \u2208 N, e \u2208 E, we have\n(7)\n\nP (G\u221e = G) = 0.\n\nRemark. For the sake of concreteness (and brevity of notation), we\nprovide the proof of this result for the initial condition X0e \u2261 1. We remark\nin Section 2.3 how the proof easily extends to the general initial condition\nsetting.\nTherefore, we assume in the sequel that G := Z/lZ, with l odd, without\nloss of generality.\nThis section is divided into three parts: in 2.1 we introduce the processes of\ninterest and justify them, in 2.2 we prove preliminary estimates and results,\nand sketch the proof of Proposition 6, which is given in 2.3.\n2.1.

First, note that under (H0), all of the above processes,\nbeing differences of nondecreasing bounded sequences, are bounded and have\nrandom finite limits as n \u2192 \u221e. Fix x \u2208 Z/lZ. The process \u03ba*(x) is a useful\nway to keep track of the changes due to repeated visits of the random walk\nto the two edges {x, x \u2212 1} and {x, x + 1}.

The proof of Proposition 6\nrelies on this observation.\nThe process \u03b5*(x) is analytically the nicest of the three since it is a martingale.\nLemma 7.\n\nFor each x \u2208 Z/lZ, the process (\u03b5n (x))n\u2208N is a martingale.\n\nProof.

We prove in Section 2.3 that there exists\na.s. x \u2208 Z/lZ such that \u03ban (x) does not converge to 0, which enables one to\nconclude that, almost surely, either {x, x + 1} or {x, x \u2212 1} is visited finitely\noften [otherwise, \u03ba\u221e (x) = 0].\nGiven x \u2208 Z/lZ, the process (\u03ban (x))n\u22650 , contrary to (\u03b5n (x))n\u22650 , is not a\nmartingale. Our first aim is therefore to estimate its mean behavior. Note\nthat if l were even, we would be able to answer the question without such\nan estimate, by the construction of a martingale (Rn (x))n\u22650 combining the\nprocesses (\u03ban (x))n\u22650 , x \u2208 Z/lZ:\nRn (x) :=\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Z/lZ,x even\n\n\u03ban (x) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)x \u03b5n (x).\n\nx\u2208Z/lZ\n\nThen an upper bound of the variance of the increments would enable us to\nprove that Rn (x) a.s. does not converge to 0, which subsequently implies\nthat there is at least one x \u2208 Z/lZ such that \u03ban (x) does not converge to 0,\nas required. Sellke [7] obtains the corresponding result (for l even) using a\nconstruction due to Rubin.\nThe behavior of (\u03ban (x))n\u2208N is described by equation (9):\n\u03ban (x) = 2\u03b5n (x) \u2212 \u03b6n (x) \u2212 \u03b6n (x \u2212 1),\nwhere \u03b6n (y), y \u2208 Z/lZ, defined in Section 2.1, is the difference between the\nweighted numbers of visits from y to y + 1 and those from y + 1 to y. Hence,\nthe study of \u03ban (x) requires [through \u03b6n (x) and \u03b6n (x \u2212 1)] some information\non the probabilities of cycles\n\u2192\n\nqn := P ({Itn +1 = 1} \u2229 {Itn+1 \u22121 = \u22121 or tn+1 = \u221e}|Ftn ),\n\u2190\n\nqn := P ({Itn +1 = \u22121} \u2229 {Itn+1 \u22121 = 1 or tn+1 = \u221e}|Ftn ).\n\u2192\n\nThe quantity qn defined here is the probability of a cycle from the right\n\u2190\n(from 0 to 1 and then returning 0 by \u22121), whereas qn is the probability of\na cycle from the left (from 0 to \u22121 and then return to 0 by 1).\n\u2192\n\u2190\nA natural method to compare qn and qn would be to write them explicitly\nfor each possible path and then to find a coupling of the corresponding paths\nwith reversed paths, as done in [3] for W (n) = n\u03c1 , \u03c1 > 1. But this method is\ndifficult to apply since the estimates depend on the regularity of W, as well\nas on the current numbers of visits to the edges.\n\u2192\n\u2190\nWe relate the quantities qn and qn using the two following observations:\n(i) for any x \u2208 Z/lZ, E(\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x)|Ftn ) provides a good estimate of\n\u2192\n\u2190\n{x,x+1}\n), provided E(\u03b4tn ,tn+1 (x)|Ftn ) is small [see Lemma 8(i)\n(qn \u2212 qn )/W (Xtn\nand (ii)];\nP\n(ii) x\u2208Z/lZ \u03b6n (x) is a martingale [Lemma 7 and equation (10)].\n\n\fSTRONGLY EDGE REINFORCED WALKS\n\n13\n\nTherefore, since all of these estimates of E(\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x)|Ftn ) have the\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\nsign of qn \u2212 qn and sum to zero, qn \u2212 qn is negligible and (\u03batn )n\u2208N is close\nto a martingale with respect to filtration (Ftn )n\u2208N [see Lemma 8(iv)]. Here,\nwe also need the fact that under assumption (H1), E(\u03b4tn ,tn+1 (x)|Ftn ) can be\nneglected for any x \u2208 Z/lZ.\n\u2192\n\u2190\n{x,x+1}\nThe link between E(\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x)|Ftn ) and (qn \u2212 qn )/W (Xtn\n)\ndescribed above is a consequence of the fact that the evolution \u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212\n\u03b6tn (x) is only significant over the excursions (tn , tn+1 ) away from 0 which are\n{x,x+1}\n) if the cycle is\ncycles, where it increases (resp., decreases) by 1/W (Xtn\nfrom the right (resp., from the left), while during the excursions which are\nnot cycles (this happens whenever Itn +1 = Itn+1 \u22121 ), for each x, the traversals\nof an edge {x, x + 1} contribute as many times positively as negatively to\nthe evolution of \u03b6*(x).\nThe property that (\u03batn )n\u2208N is close to a martingale enables one to control\nthe evolution of \u03ba2tn (Lemma 10) and to prove (in Section 2.3) that \u03batn does\nnot converge to 0 with lower bounded probability if {0, 1} is at some point\ntraversed fewer times than the other edges {x, x + 1}, x 6= 0.\nFor all x \u2208 Z/lZ, let us define the (Ftn )n\u22652 -adapted processes (un (x))n\u22652 ,\n(\u039bn )n\u22652 , (\u03bbn (x))n\u22652 and (vn )n\u22652 by\nun (x) := \u03b6tn (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn\u22121 (x)\n(14)\n\n\u2212\n\n1{Itn\u22121 +1 =1}\u2229{Itn \u22121 =\u22121 or tn =\u221e} \u2212 1{Itn\u22121 +1 =\u22121}\u2229{Itn \u22121 =1\n\nor tn =\u221e}\n\n{x,x+1}\nW (Xtn\u22121 )\n\n\u039bn :=\n\n1\n\nX\n\n{x,x+1}\n)\nx\u2208Z/lZ W (Xtn\n{x,x+1}\n\n1/W (Xtn\n\u03bbn (x) :=\n\u039bn\n\n(15)\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\u2208 (0, 1)\n\nand\nvn :=\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Z/lZ\n\n(\u03bbn\u22121 (0) + \u03bbn\u22121 (\u22121) \u2212 1x\u2208{0,\u22121} )un (x).\n\nThe processes (un (x))n\u22652 and (vn )n\u22652 play an important role, as made\nexplicit in the following lemma: E(vn+1 |Ftn ) is the drift increment of \u03batn+1 \u2212\n\u03batn [Lemma 8(iii)] and un (x) and vn+1 [which is a weighted sum of un+1 (x),\nx \u2208 Z/lZ] are small, by Lemma 8(ii), |un (x)| \u2264 \u03b4tn\u22121 ,tn (x).

Property (i) follows directly from definition (14).\nLet us prove property (ii): Assume that tn < \u221e and note that by symmetry, it suffices to consider the case Itn +1 = 1. We then have\n{x,x+1}\n\u22121\nn+1\n\nXt\n\n\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x) =\n\n(16)\n\n{x,x+1}\n\n(\u22121)k\u2212Xtn\nW (k)\n{x,x+1}\n\nX\n\nk=Xtn\n\n{x,x+1}\n\n{x,x+1}\n\n(possisince during the time interval (tn , tn+1 ), there are Xtn+1\n\u2212Xtn\nbly infinitely many) traversals of the edge {x, x + 1} in alternating directions\nand since the first traversal (if there is one) happens in the direction of the\ndirected edge (x, x + 1).\nAssume first that, in addition, tn+1 < \u221e. Now, either Itn+1 \u22121 = Itn +1 = 1\nor Itn+1 \u22121 = \u22121. In the former case, there is an even number of summands\nin (16) with alternating signs for each x, and, clearly,\n|un+1 (x)| = |\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x)| \u2264 \u03b4tn ,tn+1 (x).\n\nIn the latter case, (16) consists of an odd number of terms and, similarly,\n(17)\n\n{x,x+1}\n\n|un+1 (x)| = |\u03b6tn+1 (x) \u2212 \u03b6tn (x) \u2212 1/W (Xtn\n\n)| \u2264 \u03b4tn ,tn+1 (x).\n\nNext, assume that tn+1 = \u221e. Then there exists y 6= 0 such that {y, y + 1}\nbecomes the attracting edge during the \"uncompleted excursion\" [tn , \u221e).\nThe reasoning is very similar to the one above. Namely, if x < y, then the\nsum in (16) consists of an odd number of alternating terms and, again, an\nestimate (17) applies. If x > y, then (16) has an even number of terms and we\nuse estimate (11) to derive (17). If x = y, then (16) is an infinite alternating\nsum, so the reasoning from the tn+1 < \u221e case applies.\nTo bound vn+1 , use the fact that \u03bbn (0) + \u03bbn (\u22121) \u2208 [0, 1] and conclude\nthat\n|vn+1 | \u2264\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Z/lZ\n\n|un+1 (x)| \u2264\n\nX\n\n\u03b4tn ,tn+1 (x) = \u2206tn ,tn+1 .\n\nx\u2208Z/lZ\n\nLet us now prove (iii): for allPx \u2208 Z/lZ, (\u03b5n (x))n\u2208N are martingales and\nequation (10) holds, therefore ( x\u2208Z/lZ \u03b6n (x))n\u2208N is a martingale.

To explain the technique informally, consider the martingale\nM* = \u03bat* \u2212 drift(\u03bat* ).

We prove Proposition 6 for the initial condition X0e \u2261 1, e \u2208 E,\nbut the same proof carries through for a general initial condition, after a few\nminor modifications: the first line in the definition of the \u03ba*(x) processes\nchanges and the second line remains the same,\n\u03ban (x) = W \u2217 (Xn{x,x+1} \u2212 1) \u2212 W \u2217 (Xn{x,x\u22121} \u2212 1),\nso that the important relations (9)\u2013(10) are replaced by an equality up to\na constant.

By Lemmas 12 and 13\n(and the remark preceding Lemma 12), the same argument as in equality\n(26) yields, using {U = \u221e} \u2282 A, that if S < \u221e, then\nP (A|Ft \u0303S )\n\n= P (U = \u221e|Ft \u0303S ) + E(P (A|FtU )1{U <\u221e} |Ft \u0303S )\n\n\u2265 P (U = \u221e|Ft \u0303S ) + E(P (A|FtU )1{U <\u221e,\u03batU \u22654\u221a\u03b1e(k ) +\u2206tU ,\u221e } |Ft \u0303S )\n0\n\u221a\n\u2265 P ({U = \u221e} \u222a {U < \u221e, \u03batU \u2265 4 \u03b1e(k0 ) + \u2206tU ,\u221e }|Ft \u0303S ) \u2265 7\u03b5/256.\n\nNow, this inequality yields, together with Lemma 11, that\n\nP (A|Ftk0 ) \u2265 E(1A 1{S=\u221e} |Ftk0 ) + E(1{S<\u221e} P (A|Ft \u0303S )|Ftk0 )\n\u2265 P (A \u222a {S < \u221e}|Ftk0 ) \u00d7 7\u03b5/256 \u2265 7a\u03b52 /4864.\n\nDue to inequality (26) and the L\u00e9vy 0\u20131 law, we conclude that Proposition\n6 holds.\nAcknowledgments.
