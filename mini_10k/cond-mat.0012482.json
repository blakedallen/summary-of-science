By studying the plasmon-phonon coupling in coupled bilayer structures, we find that\nthe renormalized acoustic phonon frequency may be softened at a finite wave vector due to manybody local field corrections, particularly in low density systems where correlation effects are strong.\nWe discuss experimental possibilities to search for this predicted phonon softening phenomenon.\nPACS Number : 73.20.Mf, 73.20.Dx, 71.45.Gm, 71.45.-d\n\nMuch interest has recently1\u20133 focused on bilayer semiconductor structures, where two quantum wells are put in\nclose proximity with a high insulating barrier in-between\nto suppress interlayer tunneling. Such systems are of intrinsic interest because competition between intra- and\ninter-layer Coulomb interaction (i.e., correlation effects),\nparticularly at low carrier densities when Coulomb interaction dominates (or in high magnetic fields1\u20133 when the\nelectronic kinetic energy is quenched), may lead to novel\nand exotic ground states, collective properties, and quantum phase transitions. Although much of the recent work\nhas concentrated on bilayer quantum Hall systems1\u20133 the\nbasic issue of the competition among electron kinetic energy and intra-/inter-layer Coulomb correlations is quite\ngeneric, and interesting novel ground states and exotic\ncollective properties are, in principle, possible even in the\nzero field situation provided the rs parameter defining\nthe dimensionless ratio of Coulomb interaction strength\nto Fermi energy is high enough. In this Letter we predict a particularly novel possibility, namely a finite wave\nvector acoustic phonon softening, driven by correlation\neffects in low density bilayer systems. We believe that\nour predicted phonon softening phenomenon may be realizable in the existing (electron or hole) bilayer systems\nprovided the carrier density (and temperature) are low\nenough.\nAdvances in nanofabrication and growth of semiconductor layered structures have recently made it possible to fabricate very high quality (and very low density)\nGaAs-based high-mobility double well (bilayer) two dimensional electron systems (2DES). The carrier density\nin these systems could be very low (large rs ), making\nthem suitable for studying electronic correlation in low\ndimensions. As the density decreases, unusual behavior is expected4\u20138 due to the increasing importance of\nelectron-electron interaction as the system goes from a\nweak-coupling (small rs ) to a strong-coupling (large rs )\nregime. It is possible to have electron systems with rs\nas high as 15 \u2013 20 and hole systems with rs as high as\n25 \u2013 30. One particularly interesting possibility4 is that\nan electronic charge density wave (CDW) instability may\noccur in these low density bilayer systems before the onset of Wigner crystallization at still lower density.\nIn bilayer structures there are two collective charge\n\ndensity excitations (plasmon modes)7,8 corresponding to\nthe in-phase density fluctuation (optic plasmon, OP) and\nout-of-phase density fluctuation (acoustic plasmon, AP)\nbetween the layers. In the absence of any interlayer\ntunneling the AP mode has a linear dispersion in the\n2D wave vector because the long-range Coulomb interaction is suppressed by the screening from adjacent layers.\nWithin random phase approximation (RPA) the acoustic plasmon is shown to exist for small wave vector (long\nwavelength) at all densities. However, the linear dispersion relation of the acoustic plasmon is sensitive to manyelectron correlation effects even in the long wavelength\nregime. It has been shown that electron correlations may\nstrongly renormalize the AP mode by pushing it completely inside the single-particle electron-hole excitation\n(SPE) spectra, resulting in Landau damping of the mode\nat much smaller wave vectors than predicted by RPA4,6 .\nThus, the AP mode may become overdamped due to correlation effects. Strong correlations can thus destroy the\nAP mode without smearing out of the boundary of the\nparticle-hole continuum by defect or impurity scattering\nor thermal effects4 . When this happens, there is a strong\nshift of single particle spectral weight toward zero energy\nat some finite wave vector due to the disappearance of\nthe AP mode. The appearance of these spectral features\nwith zero energy spectral weight at finite wave vector\nindicates that a state with a periodic modulation of density costs relatively little energy to excite, and the system\nmay therefore become unstable against the formation of\na periodic bilayer CDW ground state4 due to this AP\nplasmon overdamping mechanism. This CDW is different from the one associated with the 2kF (kF being the\nFermi wave vector) Peierls instability in one dimensional\n(1D) systems9,10 , where the CDW instability occurs due\nto the electron-acoustic phonon interaction leading to a\nstrongly divergent 2kF response function. The bilayer\ncorrelation induced CDW instability does not happen at\n2kF or any other Fermi surface related wave vector.\nIn this Letter we study the electron-acoustic phonon\ninteraction in low density bilayer systems. We investigate\nthe plasmon (both OP and AP) mode coupling to the\nacoustic-phonons of the system and the consequent possibility of a softening of acoustic phonon modes caused\nby the electron-phonon interaction in 2D bilayer systems.\n\n1\n\n\fwhere a\u2020k,l , ak,l are the l-th layer electron creation and de-\n\nThe plasmon-phonon mode coupling phenomenon, which\nhybridizes the collective plasmon modes of the electron\ngas with the acoustic-phonon modes, gives rise to coupled plasmon-phonon modes. The mode coupling is particularly strong at wave vectors around the plasmonphonon resonance condition (\u03c9pl \u2248 \u03c9ph ). In 2D GaAs\nsystems the resonant mode-coupling phenomenon normally occurs at an extremely low density (n < 1.2 \u00d7 108\ncm\u22122 ) in the absence of correlation effects because the\nacoustic phonon energy is typically very low and one\nhas to go to extremely low densities for the plasma frequency to be low enough to satisfy the \u03c9pl \u2248 \u03c9ph condition. Our important finding is that in the strongly correlated bilayer systems the plasmon-phonon mode coupling\nmechanism is sufficiently enhanced to give rise to strong\n(resonant) mode coupling effect at rather high densities\nwhich are already obtainable in currently available samples (n \u2264 1.0 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 ). In addition, resonant modecoupling occurs at large wave vectors (q > 2kF ) making it potentially experimentally observable. The mode\ncoupling effect depends strongly on electron density and\nlayer separation since it originates from Coulomb correlations. We find that bilayer correlation effects in currently\navailable samples could be strong enough that mode coupling may lead to a renormalized acoustic phonon mode\nwhich becomes soft at the wave vector around the resonance. The bilayer charge density instability associated\nwith the overdamping of AP mode due to strong electron\ncorrelations gives rise to the drastic modification of the\nacoustic phonon dispersion leading to be softening.\nIn this calculation we incorporate electron correlation\neffects in the local-field corrections which are deduced\nfrom quantum Monte Carlo numerical simulation data\nfor the ground state of the 2DES11 . We note that the\nspecific correlation approximations used in our theory\nfor the local field correction do not affect our qualitative conclusion about the existence of phonon softening\nin the low density bilayer systems, although the quantitative details (precise density or wave vector at which\nsoftening occurs) depend on the approximation scheme.\nWe take the bilayer system to be made of two identical\nsymmetric quantum wells of width a separated by a distance d. The Hamiltonian describing the bilayer electronphonon system is given by H = H0 + H1 , where H0 is\nthe noninteracting electron and acoustic phonon kinetic\nenergy,\nXX\nX\nH0 =\n\u03b5(k)a\u2020k,l ak,l +\n\u03c9Q b\u2020Q bQ ,\n(1)\nk l=1,2\n\nstruction operators with 2D wave vector k, b\u2020Q the phonon\ncreation operator with 3D wave vector Q = (q, qz ),\n\u03b5(k) = k 2 /2m the kinetic energy of the electron (we\ntake h\u0304 = 1 throughout this paper), and \u03c9Q the bulk\nphonon frequency. Vll\u2032 (q) is the Coulomb interaction between l-th and l\u2032 -th layer whose matrix elements are given\nby Vll\u2032 (q) = v(q)Fll\u2032 (q), where v( q) = 2\u03c0e2 /(\u03baq) with \u03ba\nas the background lattice dielectric constant and Fll\u2032 (q)\nare the form factors describing the finite well width effects. We consider only the lowest subband (for an infinite square well potential) in each layer for simplicity.\nFor two identical layers\nR we have V11 = V22 and V12 = V21 .\nIn Eq. (2), fl (qz ) = dz\u03c6l (z)\u2217 \u03c6l (z)eiqz z , where \u03c6l (z) is\nthe subband wave function in l-th layer. Ml (Q) is the\ncoupling constant between the l-th layer electron and\nbulk GaAs phonons. In the jellium model Ml (Q) =\ni(2\u03c0e2 \u03c9Q /Q2 )1/2 . In GaAs/Alx Ga1\u2212x As systems, electrons couple to acoustic phonons via deformation potential and piezoelectric couplings. We consider only\nthe deformation potential coupling, which dominates in\nthe present context. The electron-acoustic phonon coupling constant via the deformation-potential interaction\nis given by |Ml (Q)|2 = D2 Q2 /(2\u03c1\u03c9Q ) where \u03c1 is the mass\ndensity of the lattice, D the known deformation-potential\ncoupling constant, and \u03c9Q = c0 Q, where c0 is the longitudinal bulk sound velocity, is the acoustic phonon frequency.\nElectrons interact among themselves through the direct Coulomb interaction and also through the dynamical\nvirtual-acoustic-phonon exchange process.

The width of the resonance in D\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) is given by\n2\u03b3\u00b1 (q, \u03c9).\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 we show the results for the out-ofphase charge density modulation of the two layers in the\nbilayer system (the in-phase modulation, which is not\nshown, is similar to the single layer case). We use parameters corresponding to electrons in GaAs quantum\nwells10 : m = 0.067me, \u03ba = 12.5, c0 = 5.14 \u00d7 105 cm/s,\n\u03c1 = 5.3 g/cm3 , and D = \u221216.0 eV for all our results.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the coupled plasmon-acoustic phonon\nmodes and the loss function, Im[1/\u01ebtot (q, \u03c9)] which gives\nthe mode spectral weight, as a function of energy for\nfixed wave vectors near the mode coupling region. In\nFig. 1 we choose rs = 10 corresponding to the electron\ndensity n = 0.33 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 , the well width a = 100\u00c5,\n\n(8)\n\nThe first term is the screened Coulomb interaction due\nto the collective motion of the electrons, and the second\nterm represents the renormalized electron-phonon interaction with the renormalized vertex M\u00b1 /\u01eb\u00b1 and phonon\npropagator D\u00b1 . \u01eb\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) is the symmetric (antisymmetric) dielectric function of the electron system and is\ngiven by \u01eb\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) = 1 \u2212 V\u00b1 (q)\u03a0(q, \u03c9). The renormalized\nphonon propagator D\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) is\nD\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) =\n\n2\u03c9q\n2 (q, \u03c9)\u03c7 (q, \u03c9) ,\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9q2 + 2\u03c9q M\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) = \u03a0(q, \u03c9)/\u01eb\u00b1 (q, \u03c9). The quasiparticle\nenergies of the screened longitudinal vibrations are the\npoles of D(\u03c9, q). The poles of the D(\u03c9, q) are complex\nand hence we need an analytic continuation of the response function. However, it is a good approximation\n3\n\n\fand layer separation d = 300\u00c5. The area bounded by\nthe light solid lines indicates the SPE Landau damping\ncontinuum. When correlation effects are turned off (i.e.,\nG \u2261 0) we have a well defined acoustic plasmon mode\nabove the electron hole continuum and a well defined\nacoustic phonon mode with the bare phonon dispersion\n\u03c9ph = c0 q. There is essentially no mode coupling without\ncorrelations because of the large difference in the plasmon\nand phonon energy scales. Local field effects give rise to a\nsuppression of the AP mode above the SPE and its reappearance at large wave vectors beyond the single particle\ncontinuum in spite of it being overdamped (by Landau\ndamping) at long wavelengths. This reappearance of the\nAP mode at large wave vectors, which is purely a local field effect, produces strong plasmon-phonon mode\ncoupling. In Fig. 1(b) we show the spectral weight of\nthe coupled modes. We find two peaks corresponding to\nthe coupled modes, one below the bare acoustic phonon\nmode and the other above. Since the in-phase plasmon\nmode \u03c9+ (q) is essentially unaffected by correlation effects\nand has much higher energy than the phonon mode, the\ncoupling of the in-phase plasmon mode to the acoustic\nphonon mode is negligible. (This is also the reason why\nthe phonon softening phenomenon predicted in this Letter cannot occur in single layer 2DES.)\nIn Fig. 2 we show the renormalized acoustic phonon\nmode dispersion and the damping for different layer separations by finding the complex poles of the renormalized phonon propagator, Eq. (9). The renormalized\nphonon mode is very different from the bare phonon\nmode due to correlation induced mode coupling. At the\nfinite critical wave vector qc = 2.41kF for d = 300\u00c5 and\nqc = 1.75kF for d = 690\u00c5 we find phonon softening,\nwhere the acoustic phonon mode is renormalized to zero\nfrequency \u03c9(qc ) = 0. The critical wave vector depends on\nboth density and layer separation, since it is a correlation\neffect. We emphasize that the bilayer phonon softening\ntakes place due to the resonant coupling of GaAs acoustic\nphonons to the out-of-phase charge density modulation\nassociated with the bilayer acoustic plasmons, which can\nbecome very strong at low enough carrier density. Strong\nacoustic phonon - acoustic plasmon coupling is the mechanism causing the bilayer phonon softening. Our predicted phonon softening thus necessarily requires both\nlow carrier density (large rs ) and a bilayer system.\nWe conclude by briefly discussing possible experimental means to observe the predicted phonon softening.\nThe most direct method would be to measure the bilayer\nphonon dispersion using ballistic phonon spectroscopy12\nas was done for single layer 2D systems some years ago.\nThe other possibility is to look for phonon softening indirectly through bilayer drag measurements13 where the\nmagnitude of the drag should develop interesting anomalies in the soft mode regime since the drag is mediated\npartly by the phonon exchange mechanism. It may also\nbe possible to see the softening in bilayer transresistivity\nmeasurements14 . In principle, it may be easier to see the\nsoftening phenomenon in hole bilayers where very large\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c9pl\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2.
