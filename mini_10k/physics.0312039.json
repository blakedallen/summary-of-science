This paper reviews the requirements, conceptual design\nand sensor R&D for the Vertex Tracker.\nKey words: vertex detector; linear collider\n\n1. Introduction\nThe LHC collider at CERN represents the next\nstep in the study of the high energy frontier in\nparticle physics. We expect that the data collected\nin pp collisions will provide evidence of the Higgs\nbosons and of Supersymmetry, or of other New\nPhysics signals. The Higgs bosons observation will\nbe a decisive breakthrough in our understanding\nof the origin of mass and electro-weak symmetry\nbreaking. Signals of New Physics will clarify the\nsolution to the hierarchy problem of the Standard\nModel. But neither the precision study of the Higgs\nprofile nor the investigation of New Physics will be\ncompleted at the LHC. There are measurements\nwhich will be limited in accuracy, while others may\nnot be feasible at all.\nA high energy, high luminosity linear collider\n(LC), able to deliver\ne+ e\u2212 collisions at center-of\u221a\nmass energies s = 0.3-0.5 TeV with luminosity\nin excess to 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , later upgradeable to\nabout 1 TeV, is considered as the next large scale\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\nproject in accelerator particle physics. Present\nprojects focus on warm RF (mostly X-band as for\nthe NLC and JLC projects) or super-conducting\ncavities (proposed by the TESLA collaboration)\nto achieve the needed gradients (1). Beyond it,\nmulti-TeV collisions appear to be achievable at a\nlinear collider, using a novel two-beam acceleration scheme at high frequency, developed in the\nCLIC study (2).\nThe Vertex Tracker is expected to provide the jet\nflavor identification capabilities and the accurate\nevent reconstruction that make the linear collider\nunique and allow its physics program.\nIf the Higgs boson exists and it is light, as the\npresent data indicates, its couplings to fermions of\ndifferent flavor, and hence of different mass, must\nbe accurately measured as a fundamental proof\nof the Higgs mechanism of mass generation, as\nwell as its self-coupling. Efficient flavor tagging in\nmulti-jet events and determination of heavy quark\ncharge will be instrumental to study signals of\nNew Physics both through the direct production\n15 November 2018\n\n\fof new heavy particles, coupled predominantly to\nb and t quarks, and by precise electro-weak data\nat the high energy frontier. Physics requirements\npush the vertex tracker specifications to new levels. While much has been learned in two decades\nof R&D on Si detectors for the LHC experiments,\nthe LC motivates today new and complementary\ndirections. Its experimental environment, with its\nlower event rate and radiation flux, admits Si sensors that are substantially thinner, more precise\nand more segmented than at the LHC. Technologies which have not been applicable in the high\nradiation environment of proton colliders are also\navailable, as well as sensors of new concept. But\nsignificant R&D is required. CCD vertex detectors\nhave already demonstrated very high resolution\nand segmentation with low multiple scattering at\nSLD (3). But for the CCD technology to be applicable to the LC improved radiation hardness and\na factor 100-1000 increase in readout speed are\nrequired. Technologies successfully developed for\nthe LHC program, such as hybrid pixel sensors,\nare sufficiently radiation hard and can be read\nout rapidly. But they now need to be developed\ninto much thinner devices with smaller cell size\nto improve their position resolution. Finally new\ntechnologies, such as MAPS, SOI and DEPFET\nsensors, are emerging as other potentially attractive solutions. But they need to be demonstrated\non large scales and be tailored to the LC applications. These developments need to be guided\nby a continued program of physics studies and\ndetailed simulations to define the optimal design\nand technology choices.\nSeveral Vertex Tracker designs have been proposed, relying on different sensor technologies.\nThey all share the use of pixel devices, due to the\nhigh particle density which disallows the use of\nmicrostrip detectors. Emphasis is placed on minimizing the material budget, to improve track extrapolation performances also at small momenta\nin multi-jet final states.\n\n2. Experimental Conditions\nThe Vertex Tracker at the LC will be exposed to\nbackground and radiation levels and to track densities unprecedented for e+ e\u2212 collider machines,\nthough still lower compared to proton colliders.\nThe main source of background in the interaction\nregion is due to e+ e\u2212 pairs produced and bent in\nthe intense electro-magnetic interaction of the colliding beams. Such pairs set the most stringent\nconstraint on the Vertex Tracker geometry. The\nradius and maximum length of the innermost sensitive layer are defined by the envelope of the deflected pairs. The radial and longitudinal position\nof the point of crossing of the pair envelope can be\napproximated as function of the number of particles in a bunch, N , the solenoidal magnetic field,\nB, and the bunch length, \u03c3z by:\ns\n1\n1\nN\nz[cm]\n(1)\nR[cm] = 0.35\n1010 B[T esla]\n\u03c3z [mm]\n\nz[cm] = 8.3 R2 B[T esla]\u03c3z [mm]\n\n1010\n.\nN\n\n(2)\n\nWarm RF technology requires \u03c3z to be small, while\nthe field strength B is limited by the optic and\nquadrupole requirements at the final focus. The\ninward bound on the detector radius is thus set at\n\u2243 1.5 cm, up to 1 TeV. This radius appears safe\nalso for the collimation of syncrotron radiation. At\na multi-TeV collider the innermost radius must be\npushed to \u2243 3 cm.\nParticle tracks in highly collimated jets also\nsignificantly contribute to the local track density in physics events. This is expected to be\n0.2-1.0 hits mm\u22122 at 500 GeV, to reach 0.52.5 hits mm\u2212 2 at 3.0 TeV. These figures are comparable to, or even exceed, those expected at the\nLHC: 0.03 hits mm\u22122 for proton collisions in ATLAS and 0.9 hits mm\u22122 for heavy ion collisions in\nALICE. The dose due to charged particles is expected to be manageable: \u2243 50 krad y\u22121 . On the\ncontrary, the neutron background may be important for the sensor technology choice. Neutrons are\nproduced in electromagnetic interactions of the\nspent beams and radiated particles. The resulting\n2\n\n\ffluxes are in principle large. However, they are reduced by several orders of magnitude by the masks\nat the vertex tracker position. Still, the estimated\nfluxes reaching the Si detectors are expected of\norder 109 n (1 MeV) cm\u22122 y\u22121 for TESLA (4) and\nNLC and about one order of magnitude larger for\nCLIC at 3 TeV (5).\n\npation. The typical value is of order of 15 \u03bcW/pixel\nfor CCDs, 40 \u03bcW/channel for HPS and 4 \u03bcW/pixel\nfor MAPS. The total power for CCD sensors may\nbe lowered to about 10 W if 1 V clocks are feasible. The additional dissipation from the driver\nand read-out electronics is less critical being confined outside the sensitive part of the detector. In\naddition CCDs may need to operate at low temperature to improve their radiation tolerance. The\nheat management may also depend on the bunch\nstructure of the collider and will need to be studied\nin details. In particular pulsed power operation is\nbeing considered to profit of the collider low duty\ncycle and tests have started.\nFinally suppression of noise and RF pick-up is\nessential, due to the large number of channels.\n\n3. Vertex Tracker Conceptual Design\nThe Vertex Tracker will likely consist of a multilayered barrel section, directly surrounding the\nbeam-pipe, complemented by forward disks to\nensure tracking down to small angles. Five layers\nshould ensure standalone pattern recognition and\ntracking capabilities as well as redundancy.\nThe strongest requirements on the impact parameter resolution are set by the need of efficiently\ndisentangling H 0 \u2192 bb\u0304 from H 0 \u2192 cc\u0304 Higgs boson\ndecays (6). This can be best done by exploiting the\ndifference in invariant mass and multiplicity of the\ndecay products. But for this method to be efficient,\nsecondary particle tracks need to be identified by\ntheir significantly large impact parameter down to\nlow momenta. The charm jet tagging efficiency degrades by a factor 1.5-2.0, at constant purity, if\nthe impact parameter resolution \u03c3ip changes from\n5 \u03bcm \u2295 5 \u03bcm/pt to 10 \u03bcm \u2295 30 \u03bcm/pt . Since jets\nare tagged in pairs, such loss corresponds to 2 to\n4 times the equivalent data statistics. Several other\nphysics processes support these requirements. A\nmulti-layered vertex tracker with the first sensitive layer at 1.5 cm from the interaction region and\n1% X0 of total thickness can provide the target\n\u03c3ip =5 \u03bcm \u2295 5 \u03bcm/pt . Single point resolution of\n5 \u03bcm, or better, has been achieved with different\ntechniques.\nThe main challenge comes from the limit on\nthe material budget. Several solutions are being\nstudied ranging from 20 \u03bcm thick CCD ladders\n(0.06% X0 /layer) supported only at their ends to\nback-thinned hybrid pixel sensors (0.3% X0 /layer).\nExtracting the heat dissipated by the sensors and\ntheir electronics is another important issue in the\nengineering design of the vertex tracker and the\nmaterial budget may be driven by the power dissi-\n\n4. Si Sensor Technology and R&D\n4.1. Charge Coupled Devices\nCCD sensors have characteristics which match\nin principle the main LC performance requirements. Their pixel size is small, giving single point\nresolution better than 4 \u03bcm, and the sensors are\nthin, \u2243 20 \u03bcm. Two main limitations remain: the\nread-out timing and the neutron radiation damage. At a collider with the TESLA bunch structure, the \u2243 3 M pixels in the first layer, need to\nbe read-out in not more than 50 \u03bcs to ensure a\nbackground hit density below 5 mm\u22122 . Therefore\na read-out clock of about 50 MHz is necessary. A\nnovel column parallel read-out (CPCCD) scheme\nis being developed by the LCFI Collaboration (7).\nPrototypes have been designed and produced and\nare presently being tested, which operate with\nlow-voltage clock amplitudes to reduce power dissipation. The most important radiation damage\nin CCDs is bulk Si displacements caused by heavy\nparticles causing charge carrier trapping. Deep\nlevel bound states have lifetime longer than the\ninter-pixel transfer time and the charge is lost resulting in a drop of the charge transfer efficiency\n(CTE). This becomes particularly important since\ncharges need to be transported over lengths of\norder of cm. Two possible techniques to improve\n3\n\n\fthe CTE are being studied: cooling the detector to\nincrease the trapping lifetime and keep the trapping centers filled and filling traps with light pulse\nflushing to avoid further charge loss. Tests have\nbeen performed (8) and indicate that the signal\nloss can be lowered with light pulses. First results\ngive a signal loss reduction from 29% to 18% after\nintegrating 6.5 \u00d7 109 n cm\u22122 and can be improved\nwith an optimsed setup.\n\ntaxial layer where the charge carriers spread by\nthermal diffusion. Small pixel size and integrated\nelectronics offer a good solution to the problems\nof resolution and layer thickness. Detector have\nbeen tested on particle beams and after irradiation. Tolerance to neutron fluxes has been established up to 1012 n/cm2 , which is well beyond the\nLC requirements. A full scale 1 M pixel sensors\nhas proved that MAPS offer full efficient detectors\nwith 2 \u03bcm accuracy and excellent two-track resolution. New developments are addressing the readout speed and providing increased functionality,\nincluding data sparsification and integrated correlated double sampling. Test structures in 0.35 \u03bcm\ntechnology with 5 MHz column parallel readout\nare being evaluated.\n\n4.2. Hybrid Pixel Sensors\nHybrid pixel sensors (HPS) have provided a\nreliable solution to 3D tracking from LEP 2 to\nLHC. Their main limitations, due to the total\nsensor plus chip thickness and the limited single\npoint resolution, may be overcome with a dedicated R&D program. Beside the vertex tracker,\nHPS detectors offer a suitable technology also for\nforward tracking with good resolution and fast\ntime-stamping. A scheme with interleaved nodes,\nextending that usefully applied to microstrip detectors, was proposed to improve the point accuracy by interpolating the charge sharing on\nneighboring read-out nodes. Test structures have\nbeen produced and successfully tested, providing\na proof of principle (9). A single point resolution of\n\u2243 3 \u03bcm can be achieved, if tracks are sufficiently\nisolated. Now a dedicated R&D program on backthinning and bump-bonding represents the main\nfocus, to reduce the detector thickness.\n\n4.4. Other Options\nThe variety of technologies for applications at\nthe linear collider is further enriched by new concepts currently being investigated.\nAnother route toward monolithic sensors is the\nrealization of FET devices integrated in highresistivity fully depleted n bulk which amplify\nthe charge at the point of collection, avoiding\nlosses. This scheme, adopted by DEPFET devices,\nprovides full bulk sensitivity and the low input\ncapacitance ensures low noise and have robust\ncorrelated double sampling capabilities. DEPFET\nsensors have been developed primarily for X-ray\nimaging. A dedicated R&D for the LC vertex\ntracker has started (14).\nAnother attractive architecture for a monolithic\npixel sensor is Silicon on insulator (SOI), where a\nSi film sits on a thin insulator over a high resistivity\nSi substrate acting as detecting volume. The readout is built in the thin layer. There are a number\nof technological issues to be addressed in matching\nthe pixel manufacturing technique with the CMOS\nprocessing. SOI test structures have been fabricated 0.8 AMS technology (13) and characterized.\nRecently signals from ionizing particles have been\nrecorded, providing a first proof of principle of this\ndesign.\nEmerging ion etching technologies have enabled\nthe development of a new 3D detector scheme (15).\n\n4.3. MAPS Sensors\nMonolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) exploit\nthe epitaxial layer of the CMOS wafer as detector\nsubstrate, to integrate the detector and the frontend readout electronics on the same silicon wafer,\nusing standard VLSI CMOS technology. The development of MAPS detectors started with application as photon detectors where they are becoming increasingly popular. Their application to\ndetection of m.i.p. signals was initiated as a LC\nR&D (10; 11) and the first vertex tracker based\non this technology is under construction for the\nSTAR detector upgrade at RHIC (12). The signal is collected from the undepleted bulk or epi4\n\n\fIn these detectors small diameter holes are drilled\nthrough the silicon wafer. Carriers drift perpendicular to the wafer thickness and normal to the\nparticle trajectory. 3D sensors are characterized\nby good radiation tolerance and very fast time response, owing to their geometry. This makes them\ninteresting for applications at small radius in the\nforward region.\nIn a farther future, the deposition of hydrogenated amorphous Si layer on ASIC may also\nbecome a competitive technology, bringing advantages both in terms of fast signals and, possibly,\nproductions costs (16).\n\n[5] Physics at the CLIC multi-TeV Collider,\nM.

It addresses issues which are complementary to the developments tailored to the LHC,\nwhile other aspects of detector engineering, services and read-out electronics will largely profits\nfrom the LHC experience. At present several detector architectures appear promising. However, it\nwill be important to extend the R&D phase, until\nthe time of project approval and final detector design. As pixel sensors have a wide, interdisciplinary\nfield of applications, ranging from structural biology to medical imaging and astrophysics, the linear collider R&D effort is also significantly nested\nto those broader developments.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
