In addition, eleven new non-trivial combinatorial formulae of order 2 are\npresented which are not of GPV finite-type.\nKeywords: knot, virtual knot, parity, finite-type invariant, combinatorial formula\n\n1. Introduction\nGauss diagram formulae for finite-type invariants of classical knots were first introduced by Polyak\nand Viro [19]. An important theorem of Goussarov [8] states that every integer valued finite-type\ninvariant of classical knots has a combinatorial formula. Those formulae for classical knot invariants\nwhich are also virtual knot invariants are entirely described by the Polyak algebra. However, not\nevery finite-type invariant of virtual knots is given as an element of the Polyak algebra.\nIndeed, there are two notions for finite-type invariants of virtual knots. The one described by the\nPolyak algebra is called Goussarov-Polyak-Viro finite-type (GPV for short). The other notion, due\nto Kauffman [10], is the natural generalization of Vassiliev invariant to the virtual case. Every GPV\nfinite-type invariant is of Kauffman finite-type. On the other hand, not every Kauffman finite-type\ninvariant is of GPV finite-type [3, 4, 10]. It follows that not every Kauffman finite-type invariant of\nvirtual knots is representable by a combinatorial formula.\nThis observation leads to a natural question: Does there exist an extension of the Polyak algebra\nso that every integer valued Kauffman finite-type invariant of virtual knots is representable by\na combinatorial formula? In the present paper, we construct a proper extension of the Polyak\nalgebra and investigate its relation to the GPV and Kauffman finite-type invariants. The resulting\nextension contains non-trivial combinatorial formulae which are exotic in the sense that they are\nGauss diagram formulae which are not of GPV finite-type. In particular, for every n, there is a\ncombinatorial formula of order n that is invariant under the virtualization move and hence, by [3],\nis not of GPV finite-type.\nThe method of extension is by the second named author's recent discovery of parity in knot theory\n[9]. A parity is an axiomatic way of labelling the arrows of a Gauss diagram that behaves nicely\nunder the Reidemeister moves. The labels for a parity are elements of Z2 , where each arrow is either\nformally even or odd. Hence, the extension of the Polyak algebra given here is a formal labelling\nof arrows as even or odd, subject to some relations so as to make the resulting algebra invariant\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\nunder the Reidemeister moves. The resulting quotient by these relations is denoted by Qn , where\nthe natural number n is the maximum number of arrows allowed in a diagram.\nTheorem 1. Let n \u2208 N and let D be the set of Gauss diagrams on S 1 (or R). For any parity P ,\nthere is a map In [P ] : Z[D] \u2192 Qn such that if v \u2208 HomZ (Qn , Q), then v \u25e6 In [P ] is an invariant\nof virtual knots (resp., long virtual knots). If P is a parity of flat virtual knots (resp., long virtual\nknots), then v \u25e6 In [P ] is a Kauffman finite-type invariant of order \u2264 n.\nProof. See Lemmas 5 and 6.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe exotic combinatorial formulae are constructed using several projections of Qn : the one which\nkills all diagrams with any even arrows (denoted Tn ), the one which kills all diagrams with any odd\narrows (denoted En ), and the one which kills a diagram if it has fewer than n arrows or all even\narrows (denoted On ). The main results may be summarized as follows.\nTheorem 2. The group HomZ (Tn , Q) is a finitely generated free Z-module of rank \u03c1 where \u03c1 is\ngiven by:\n\u001a\nn\nfor Gauss diagrams on S 1\n\u03c1=\n.\nn(n + 3)/2 for Gauss diagrams on R\nIf P is the Gaussian parity, there is a generating set of combinatorial formulae which are of Kauffman\nfinite-type but not of GPV finite-type. For any parity and n \u2208 N there is a virtualization invariant\ncombinatorial formula of order n for every n (and hence by [3], not of GPV finite-type).\nProof. See Lemmas 9, 11, 12 and 14.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet A denote the set of Gauss diagrams where all arrows are drawn dashed and let A(1,0) denote\nthe dashed arrow diagrams where each arrow is labelled with either a 0 or a 1 arbitrarily. Recall\nfrom [8] that there is a natural pairing h*, *i : Z[A] \u00d7 Z[A] \u2192 Z defined on generators by hD, Ei = 1\nif D = E and 0 otherwise. There is a similar pairing hh*, *ii : Z[A(1,0) ] \u00d7 Z[A(1,0) ] \u2192 Z defined on\ngenerators by hhD, Eii = 1 if D = E as labelled Gauss diagrams and 0 otherwise. If I : Z[D] \u2192 Z[A]\nis the map which sums over all subdiagrams of a Gauss diagram and F is GPV combinatorial\nformula, then hF, I(*)i is a long virtual knot invariant. For such invariants, we have the following\ndecomposition theorem.\nTheorem 3. If F is a homogeneous GPV formula of order n, then there is an F e \u2208 En , called the\neven part of F , and F o \u2208 On , called the odd part of F , such that:\nhF, I(*)i = hhF e , I[P ](*)ii + hhF o , I[P ](*)ii .\nFor the Gaussian parity P , F e and F o are of Kauffman finite-type but not of GPV finite-type of\norder \u2264 m for any m, whenever F is not constant on the set of classical knots.\nProof. See Lemmas 16, 17, 18, and 19.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3 follows from a functorality argument. However, many of the combinatorial\nformulae presented in the present paper have no analogue in the Polyak algebra. The invariants from\nTheorem 2 do not come from functorality. In other words, they are not the even or odd part of\nany GPV combinatorial formula. Moreover, it will be shown that there are Kauffman finite-type\ninvariants of order two in O2 which cannot be written as a linear combination of the even and odd\nparts of any GPV formula.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we review the two notions of finite-type\ninvariants, parity, and the methods which will be used in the proofs of the main results. In Section\n3, we define the parity enhanced Poyak algebra and prove the various parts of Theorem 1. In Section\n4, we prove the various parts of Theorem 2. Section 5 contains a discussion of the Polyak algebra,\nfunctorality, and a proof of the parts of Theorem 3. Finally, Section 6 contains a table which gives\na generating set for combinatorial formulae in O2 . The formulae are linearly independent over Z.\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n3\n\n2. Background\n2.1. Two Flavors of Finite-Type. In the present section, we review the two different notions of\nfinite-type invariants for virtual knots.\n2.1.1. Kauffman Finite-Type. In [10], Kauffman introduced the notion of graphical finite-type invariants. This notion of finite-type invariant is the one which is most similar to the well-known\ndiagrammatic formulation of finite-type invariants for classical knots. In Kauffman's version, singular knots are replaced with 4-valent graphs.\nLet K\u2022 : S 1 \u2192 R2 (or R1 \u2192 R2 ) be a virtual knot diagram (resp., long virtual knot diagram), where the transversal self-intersections are marked with one of three possible crossing types:\nover/under crossing, virtual crossing, or a graphical vertex. In addition to planar isotopies, the\nReidemeister moves, and virtual moves, one adds rigid vertex isotopy moves[10]. Any virtual knot\ninvariant v can be extended to an invariant of knotted 4-valent graphs by successive application of\nthe following rule:\n!\n!\n!\nv\n\n:= v\n\n\u2212v\n\n.\n\nA virtual knot invariant v is said to be of Kauffman finite-type of order \u2264 n if v(K\u2022 ) = 0 for all\nknotted 4-valent graphs K\u2022 with more than n graphical vertices.\nExamples of Kauffman finite-type invariants arise in the same way as finite-type invariants for\nclassical knots. Let fK (A) denote the Kauffman A polynomial of a virtual knot K. The coefficient\nof xn in the power series expansion of fK (ex ) about x = 0 is a Kauffman finite-type invariant (see\n[10]). Other examples of Kauffman finite-type invariants can be found in [16].\n2.1.2. Goussarov-Polyak-Viro Finite-Type. In addition to classical crossings, virtual crossings, and\ngraphical vertices, knot diagrams may also have semi-virtual crossings[8]. Like classical crossings,\nsemi-virtual crossings may appear as \"over crossings\" or \"under crossings\". Semi-virtual crossings\nare depicted as over or under classical crossings which are circumscribed by a small circle(see below).\n\nClassical Crossing\n\nSemi-virtual Crossing\n\nVirtual Crossing\n\nNote that the definition of these crossing types depends on the orientation of the crossing. The\norientation of the strands has been omitted in the figure.\nVirtual knot or long virtual knot invariants are extended to these semi-virtual diagrams by the\nfollowing relation:\n!\n!\n!\nv\n\n:= v\n\n\u2212v\n\n.\n\nThe extension to virtual knots with semi-virtual crossings is also denoted v. A virtual knot invariant\nis said to be of Goussarov-Polyak-Viro finite-type of order \u2264 n if v(K\u25e6 ) = 0 for all semi-virtual knots\nK\u25e6 with more than n semi-virtual crossings. For brevity, they are called GPV finite-type invariants.\nIn [8] it was shown that every GPV finite-type invariant is also of Kauffman finite-type. However,\nthe converse is not true (see Section 2.1.3).\n2.1.3. Distinguishing between Kauffman and GPV finite-type invariants. There are two known methods for showing that a Kauffman finite-type invariant is not of GPV finite-type. The first is invariance\nunder the virtualization move. The second, more general method, is to employ twist lattices. As\nboth techniques are used in this paper, we discuss both of them at length.\nThe virtualization move at a crossing in a knot diagram is as shown on the left hand side of\nFigure 1. In [10], it was shown that the Jones polynomial is invariant under the virtualization move.\nHence, all of the the Kauffman finite-type invariants obtained from it also have this property. More\n\n\f4\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\ngenerally, Khovanov homology with arbitrary coefficients is also invariant under the virtualization\nmove [17]. However, in [3], it was proved that there are no nonconstant integer valued GPV finitetype invariants that are invariant under the virtualization move. Hence, to show that an integer\nvalued Kauffman finite-type invariant is not of GPV finite-type, it is sufficient to prove that it is\ninvariant under the virtualization move. For further discussion of the virtualization move, see [6, 11].\n\n\u21cc\n\n,\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u21cc\n\n\u03b5\n\nFigure 1. The Virtualization Move and Gauss Diagram Equivalent\nNote that the virtualization move has a Gauss diagram description: it changes the direction of\nthe arrow of the crossing without changing the sign (see right hand side of Figure 1).\nA more general method for distinguishing Kauffman and GPV finite-type invariants was given by\nthe first named author in [4]. There, Eisermann's twist lattices [5] were extended to Kauffman and\nGPV finite-type invariants of virtual knots (also see [5] for related references). In the present paper,\ntwist lattices will be used to show that some combinatorial formulae are of Kauffman finite-type but\nnot GPV finite-type.\nRecall that D is the set of Gauss diagrams on R or S 1 . A twist sequence is a function \u03a6 : Z \u2192 D\nsuch that the terms \u03a6(k) are identical outside a pair of disjoint intervals and inside the pair of\nintervals, the terms resemble one of the rows of the following diagram.\n...,\n\nall arrows signed \u2296\nk = \u22122, k = \u22121, k = 0\n\nall arrows signed \u2295\nk = 1, k = 2, k = 3, . . .\n\n***\n\n***\n\n***\n\n***\n\nNote that the k-th term of the sequence in the first row has |2k \u2212 1| arrows in the distinguished\npair of arcs. Alternatively, we have the second row where every k-th term has |2k| arrows in the\ndistinguished pair of arcs.\nThe type of a twist sequence is given by the word XY Z. The character X = E if there is an\nEven number of arrows in each term and X = O if there is an Odd number of arrows in each term.\nThe character Y = S if the ordering of the endpoints in the right vertical interval is the Same as\nthe ordering in the left vertical interval and Y = B if the ordering on the right is Backwards. The\ncharacter Z = L or R according to whether the arrow(s) in the k = 1 term point Left or Right.\n(Note: For twist sequences on S 1 , the parameter Z is dropped.) For more details on twist sequences\nand their types, the reader is referred to [4].\nA fractional twist sequence is the same as twist sequence except that inside the pair of distinguished intervals, the terms are as in the following table.\n...,\n***\n\nall arrows signed \u2296\nk = \u22122, k = \u22121, k = 0\n\nall arrows signed \u2295\nk = 1, k = 2, k = 3, . . .\n***\n\nA fractional twist sequence is said to be of type F Y Z where F stands for fractional and Y and Z are\nas above. Note that the distinguished arrows in a twist sequence of type FSZ intersect one another.\nOn the other hand, the distinguished arrows in a twist sequence of type FBZ do not intersect one\nanother.\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n5\n\nA twist lattice (fractional twist lattice) is a function \u03a6 : Zm \u2192 D such that each of the m standard\ninclusions Z \u2192 Zm \u2192 D is a twist sequence (resp. fractional twist sequence). The Gauss diagram\n\u03a6(~0) is called the base of the fractional twist lattice. The following theorem is a generalization of a\ntheorem of Eisermann [5].\nTheorem 4 (Chrisman [4]). A virtual knot or virtual long knot invariant v : Z[D] \u2192 Q is of\nKauffman finite-type (GPV finite-type) of order \u2264 n if and only if for every twist lattice (resp.\nfractional twist lattice) \u03a6 : Zm \u2192 D, the composition v \u25e6 \u03a6 : Zm \u2192 Q is a (discrete) polynomial of\ndegree \u2264 n.\nIn [4], a twist lattice argument was used to show that the Kauffman finite-type invariants obtained\nfrom the Kauffman A polynomial (i.e. the polynomial invariant which arises from the generalization\nof the Kauffman bracket to virtual knots[10]) are not of GPV finite-type. This fact was originally\nobserved for small orders in [10].\n2.2. Parities. Let D be a Gauss diagram. Let A(D) denote the set of arrows of D. If D \u21cc D\u2032\nis a Reidemeister move, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between arrows not involved in\nthe move. For w \u2208 A(D), we denote the corresponding unaffected arrow as w\u2032 \u2208 A(D\u2032 ). Let D(1,0)\ndenote the set of Gauss diagrams where each arrow is labelled with an element of Z2 = {0, 1}. A\nparity is a function P : D \u2192 D(1,0) satisfying the following four properties.\n(1) If D \u2208 D has an arrow x with consecutive endpoints then P assigns the label 0 to x.\n(2) If D \u2208 D and x, y \u2208 A(D) have opposite sign and are embedded as the two affected arrows\nin a Reidemeister 2 move, then P assigns the same label to x and y.\n(3) Suppose that D \u21cb D\u2032 is a Reidemeister 3 move. Let {x, y, z} denote the set of arrows of D\nwhich are changed by the move and {x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 } the set of corresponding arrows in D\u2032 . Then\nP assigns the label 1 to either zero or two elements of {x, y, z}. If t \u2208 {x, y, z}, then P\nassigns the same label to t and t\u2032 in {x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 }.\n(4) If D \u21cb D\u2032 is any Reidemeister move, and (y, y \u2032 ) is a corresponding pair of unaffected arrows,\nthen P assigns the same label to y and y \u2032 .\nThe standard example of a parity is the Gaussian parity. Let D be a Gauss diagram. To D we\nassociate its intersection graph. Two arrows a and b are said to intersect (or to be linked) if their\nendpoints alternate on R or S 1 . We write (a, b) = (b, a) = 1 if a and b intersect and (a, b) = 0\notherwise. The intersection graph is the graph with a vertex for each arrow of the diagram and an\nedge between two vertices a and b exactly when (a, b) = 1 (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. A long virtual knot and its intersection graph.\nGiven a Gauss diagram D and its intersection graph G, the Gaussian parity is defined as follows.\nAn arrow in D is labelled 1 if the degree of its vertex in G is odd and a 0 if the degree of its vertex\nin G is even. It is easy to see that this definition satisfies the parity axioms. While quite simple in\nconstruction, the Gaussian parity has useful applications to realization and minimality problems in\nknot theory. For example, the Gaussian parity was used in [14] to prove that there are nontrivial\nfree knots. This provided a first counterexample to a conjecture of Turaev (see also [7]).\nThere are many examples of parities and their applications in knot theory. In [1], parities were\nused to extend several knot polynomials. In [15], parities and justified parity were used to produce\n\n\f6\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\na sliceness obstruction for free knots. Additionally, there exists a parity of flat virtual knots which\ndetects non-invertibility of free knots. More recently, the universal parity group has been used to\nconstruct a natural map from knots in thickened surfaces to classical knots [13]. Although parities\nare defined combinatorially, these observations imply that parities encode interesting topological and\ngeometric properties of virtual knots.\n3. Theorem 1: Parity Enhanced Polyak Algebra\n3.1. Construction of Parity Enhanced Polyak Algebra. The construction is the same for\nGauss diagrams on S 1 and Gauss diagrams on R. Consider A(1,0) , the collection of Gauss diagrams\nwith dashed arrows where each arrow has the label 1 or 0 (the empty Gauss diagram is by decree\nalso in A(1,0) ). Note that the labels of this set are chosen arbitrarily. Hence, a Gauss diagram with\nn arrows has 2n ways to attach labels to the arrows.\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b5\n\n0\n\nQ1 :\n\n= 0, Q2 :\n\nQ3 :\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\n+\n\n=\n\nj' \u03b5\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nk\n\nk' \u03b5\n\n+\n\nj' \u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n\u03b4\n\n+\n\n=0\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n\ni\n\nk\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b4\n\n+\n\u03b4\n\ni\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n+\n\n+\nk\n\nk' \u03b5\ni'\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nk' \u03b5\n\n+\n\ni\n\n+\n\nj' \u03b5\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nIn Q3, we include all possibilities where i = i\u2032 , j = j \u2032 , k = k \u2032 , and i + j + k \u2261 i\u2032 + j \u2032 + k \u2032 \u2261 0\n(mod 2). Note also that the \u03b4 in the Q2 relations refers to a label of 1 or 0.\nDefine \u2206Q = hQ1, Q2, Q3i. Let An \u2282 A(1,0) be the set of those diagrams having more than n\narrows. The parity enhanced Polyak algebra is defined by the following quotients:\nQ=\n\nZ[A(1,0) ]\nZ[A(1,0) ]\n, Qn =\n.\n\u2206Q\nh\u2206Q, An i\n\nFor Gauss diagrams on R, the multiplication map for the algebra is defined in the same way as for\nthe Polyak algebra: \u03bc(D1 \u2297 D2 ) is the concatenation D1 D2 of the diagrams. The algebra structure\nof the parity enhanced Polyak algebra will not be used in the present paper. Instead, we will refer\nto parity enhanced Polyak groups and use only its structure as a finitely generated abelian group.\nFollowing [8], we define a map i : Z[D(1,0) ] \u2192 Z[A(1,0) ] on generators by i(D) = D with all arrows\ndrawn dashed and all sign and Z2 markings unchanged. Let P be a parity. Define I[P ] : Z[D] \u2192\nZ[A(1,0) ] on generators by:\nX\ni(D\u2032 ).\nI[P ](D) =\nD\u2032 \u2282P (D)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all subdiagrams D\u2032 of P (D) \u2208 D(1,0) , with the corresponding arrows in\nD\u2032 labelled exactly as in P (D). If \u03c0n : Q \u2192 Qn is the natural projection, we define In [P ] : Z[D] \u2192 Qn\nby the composition In [P ] = \u03c0n \u25e6 I[P ].\nFor any parity P , the linear functionals in HomZ (Qn , Q) give rise to virtual knot invariants.\nLemma 5 (proof of Theorem 1). Let P be any parity for Gauss diagrams on S 1 or R. If v \u2208\nHomZ (Qn , Q), then v \u25e6 In [P ] is a virtual knot invariant.\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n7\n\nProof. Given any Reidemeister relation, apply the map I[P ]. The distribution of zeros and ones\nin the \u2206Q relations coincides with the parity definition in Section 2.2. Collect terms in the image\nwhich are identical outside the affected arrows. Each of the resulting groupings all lie in \u2206Q. The\nfact that these all vanish in Qn is sufficient to guarantee that v \u25e6 \u03c0n \u25e6 I[P ] is an invariant.\n\u0003\nCombinatorial formulae my be defined in direct analogy to those in [8]. There is the pairing\nhh*, *ii : Z[A(1,0) ] \u00d7 Z[A(1,0) ] \u2192 Z defined on generators by hhD1 , D2 ii = 1 if D1 = D2 as labelled\nGauss diagrams and hD1 , D2 i = 0 if D1 6= D2 . A combinatorial formula of order \u2264 n is an element\nF \u2208 Z[A(1,0) ] such that all terms in F have \u2264 n arrows and hhF, rii = 0 for all r \u2208 \u2206Q. For a parity\nP , a combinatorial formula F defines a virtual knot or long virtual knot invariant vF by the rule:\nvF (*) = hhF, I[P ](*)ii .\nIt follows from the definitions that hhF, *ii \u2208 HomZ (Qn , Q). The collection of all such invariants for\na parity P are referred to as combinatorial P -formulae.\n3.2. Example: Existence of Nontrivial Formulae. As an example of a combinatorial P -formula,\nconsider the linear combination shown in Figure 3. Note that only the terms with all \u2295 arrows are\ngiven. For each drawn term D\u2295,\u2295 , there are three additional terms D\u2295,\u2296 , D\u2296,\u2295 , D\u2296,\u2296 which correspond to the three additional ways in which the arrows can be signed. The coefficient of D\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 in\nthe sum is the coefficient of D\u2295,\u2295 times \u01eb1 * \u01eb2 (this is the simplification convention of [8]).\n\nFigure 3. A non-trivial formula F1 of order 2.\nTo show that this is a combinatorial P -formula, it is sufficient to check the relation Q1,Q2, and\nQ3. Since none of the diagrams has an arrow labelled 0 with consecutive endpoints, it follows that\nhhF1 , Q1ii = 0.\nFor a Q2 relation, note that all the affected arrows must have the same label. As there is no\npair of arrows having both the same direction and the same label and there are no diagrams having\nexactly one arrow, it follows that hhF1 , Q2ii = 0 for all Q2 relations having two or fewer arrows.\nFor Q2 relations having two or more arrows in each term, the simplification convention implies that\nhhF1 , Q2ii = 0.\nFinally, the Q3 relations must be verified. Each term in a Q3 relation contains at least two arrows.\nHowever, the terms of F1 have two arrows each. Hence we must verify a number of six-term relations\ni.e. the sum of terms of the Q3 relation which has only two arrows in every term. The three intervals\nof the Q3 relation can be embedded in six ways into R. For each of these cases, the labels of the\narrows can be all zero or exactly one label can be zero. If all the labels are zero, the relation is trivially\nsatisfied. Hence for each embedding of the intervals into R, there are three cases to check. The case\nof one embedding is given in Figure 4. It is easily checked that hhF1 , LHS(Q3) \u2212 RHS(Q3)ii = 0 for\neach of these cases.\nWe note also that this combinatorial formula is independent of the GPV order two invariants.\nRecall from [8] that the order 2 GPV finite-type invariants for long knots are generated by the\nfollowing formulae:\n+\n*\n+\n*\nv21 (*) =\n\n, I(*) , v22 (*) =\n\n, I(*) .\n\n\f8\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\n+ +\n\n1\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ 1\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n10\n\n=\n\n+ +\n\n1\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1 +\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n01\n\n+ +\n\n0\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ 0\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n11\n\n=\n\n+ +\n\n0\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0 +\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n11\n\n+ +\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ 1\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n01\n\n=\n\n+ +\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1 +\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n10\n\nFigure 4.

Let P denote the Gaussian parity. We have v21 (D) = v22 (D) = 0.\nOn the other hand, hhF1 , I[P ](D)ii = \u22122. We see that the invariant vF1 cannot be written as a\nlinear combination of the invariants v21 and v22 .\n\nFigure 5. F1 is not a linear combination of v21 and v22 .\n3.3. Parity of Flat Virtual Knots and Kauffman Finite-Type. Recall that a flat virtual knot\ndiagram is an equivalence class of virtual knot diagrams. Two virtual knot diagrams are in the same\nflat equivalence class if they may be obtained from one another by a sequence of crossing changes,\nvirtual moves, Reidemeister moves, and planar isotopies.\nFlat virtual knots are represented in the plane as virtual knot diagrams where the over/under\ncrossing information has been forgotten. The non-virtual crossings are indicated just as usual intersection points of two lines. For each such diagram, there corresponds a signed chord diagram. There\nis a virtual knot having either choice of sign in the flat equivalence class. However, there is only one\nchoice of the direction of the arrow so that the chord diagram corresponds with the representation\nof the flat equivalence class. Changing both direction and sign of an arrow corresponds to switching\nthe crossing from over to under or vice versa. For Gauss diagrams, this corresponds to changing the\ndirection and sign of an arrow (see Figure 6).\n\nD=\n\n, D\u2032 =\n\nFigure 6. Equivalence Relation for Flat Virtual Knots\nThis motivates the following definition. A parity P is said to be a parity of flat virtual knots if\nfor all Gauss diagrams D, D\u2032 which differ by the direction and sign of a single arrow, as in Figure 6,\nthen P assigns the same labels to the corresponding arrows of D and D\u2032 . The Gaussian parity is an\nexample of a parity of flat virtual knots. In addition, there are parities of flat virtual knots which\narise from characteristic Z2 -cohomology classes (see [12]).\nLemma 6 (proof of Theorem 1). If P is a parity of flat virtual knots on S 1 or R and v \u2208\nHomZ (Qn , Q), then v \u25e6 In [P ] is a Kauffman finite-type invariant of order \u2264 n.\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n9\n\nProof. Suppose that K is rigid 4-valent graph with one graphical vertex. The resolution of this\ncrossing may be expressed in terms of Gauss diagrams as D \u2212 D\u2032 , where D and D\u2032 are as in Figure\n6. Now, every arrow of D corresponds to an arrow of D\u2032 having the same parity. We apply I[P ] to\nobtain:\n\nI[P ] :\n\n\u2192\n\n+\n\n,\n\nI[P ] :\n\n\u2192\n\n+\n\n.\n\nThe second terms on the RHS of these equations are identical because P is a parity of flat virtual\nknots. Therefore, every term in I[P ](D \u2212 D\u2032 ) contains at least one arrow. In general, n + 1 graphical\nvertices will yield at least n + 1 arrows in every nonzero term. Hence, v \u25e6 In [P ] vanishes on all\n4-valent graphs with more than n graphical vertices.\n\u0003\n4. Theorem 2: Properties of Odd Arrow Groups\nThe odd arrow group Tn comes from the projection of Qn which kills any diagrams which have an\narrow labelled with a 0. More specifically, let E1 denote those diagrams having \u2265 1 arrows labelled\n0 and perhaps some arrows labelled 1. We define the n-th odd arrow group, denoted Tn , by the\nfollowing projections.\nQn\nQn\n, Tn :=\n\u03c0nT : Q \u2192\nhE1 i\nhE1 i\nThe symbol T is chosen due to the similarity between these invariants and discrete Taylor polynomials\n(see below). In the following sections, we compute the rank of the groups HomZ (Tn , Q). We also\nshow that for any parity P , there is a virtualization invariant combinatorial formulae of order n\nfor every n. For the Gaussian parity, it is shown that there is a generating set of combinatorial\nP -formulae which are of Kauffman finite-type but not GPV finite-type.\n4.1. Simplifying the Projection to Odd Arrows. The first step in the proof of Theorem 2 is to\nfind a presentation of the groups Tn in terms of only odd arrows. We consider each of the relations\nQ1, Q2 and Q3 in turn.\nQ1: All Q1 relations are automatically satisfied since there is at least one arrow marked with the\nlabel 0.\nQ2: In this case, either both arrows are labelled 0 or both arrows are labelled 1. If both arrows are\nlabelled 0, the relation is trivially satisfied.\nIf both arrows are labelled 1, the relation cannot be simplified further. So the only Q2 relations\nneeded are those with \u03b4 = 1 and all other arrows labelled 1. Relations Q2 where all arrows (including\nthose not in the drawn intervals) are labelled one will be denoted by Q2(1) .\nQ3: Consider then the labellings of arrows involved in a Q3 relation. On the left hand side of\nthe relation, there are arrows {i, j, k}. On the right hand side, there are corresponding arrows\n{i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 }. By the definition of parity, either all three of the arrows are labelled 0 or only one is\nlabelled 0. If all arrows are 0, then the condition is trivially satisfied.\nOtherwise, there are three cases: of the triple, only the arrows labeled (i, i\u2032 ) are even or only the\narrows labeled (j, j \u2032 ) are even or only the arrows labeled (k, k \u2032 ) are even. In each case, all but two\n\n\f10\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\nof the labelled diagrams vanish. The resulting three relations are given below.\nQ3a\n\n(1)\n\n: =\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\nk\n\ni\n\nQ3b\n\n(1)\n\nQ3c\n\ni\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\nk' \u03b5\n\nk' \u03b5\n\n: =\n\n: =\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\nk\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b5\n\nj' \u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n=\n\n=\n\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nj' \u03b5\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nWe will refer to the collection {Q3a(1) , Q3b(1) , Q3c(1) } as the commutativity relations. Note here\nthat all of the arrows outside the intervals are also labelled 1. Let A(1) denote those signed dashed\n(1)\narrow diagrams containing only arrows labelled 1. Let An denote the set of dashed arrow diagrams\nhaving more than n arrows, all of which are labelled 1. Collecting together the above statements\ngives the following lemma.\nLemma 7. For every n \u2265 1, there is an isomorphism of groups:\nTn \u223c\n= D\n\nZ[A(1) ]\n(1)\n\nAn , Q2(1) , Q3a(1) , Q3b(1) , Q3c(1)\n\nE.\n\n4.2. Some Example Invariants. The next step in the proof of Theorem 2 is to define a number\nof example invariants and show that they are realized by combinatorial P -formulae. The main\nargument relies upon discrete power series. We review the necessary definitions for the discrete\ncalculus in this section.\nConsider first Gauss diagrams on R. Let P be any parity of long virtual knots and D \u2208 D. Define\nL\u03b5 (D) (R\u03b5 (D)) to be the number of arrows of P (D) pointing left (respectively, right), signed \u03b5, and\nlabelled 1. Define \u03b8L [P ] : D \u2192 Z and \u03b8R [P ] : D \u2192 Z as follows:\n\u03b8L [P ](D) =\n\u03b8R [P ](D) =\n\nL\u2295 (D) \u2212 L\u2296 (D),\nR\u2295 (D) \u2212 R\u2296 (D).\n\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] : D \u2192 Z by the formula:\nDefine \u03b8L,R\nn1 ,n2\n[P ](D) = (\u03b8L [P ](D))n1 (\u03b8R [P ](D))n2 .\n\u03b8L,R\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] is an invariant of virtual knots for every parity P\nProposition 8. \u03b8L,R\n\nProof. It is sufficient to show that \u03b8H [P ], H = L or R, satisfies the Reidemeister relations \u03a91, \u03a92,\n\u03a93, where H = L or R. Since the isolated arrow in an \u03a91 move is always labelled 0, the number of\narrows labelled 1 on LHS and RHS of such a move is the same. In an \u03a92 move, both of the arrows\nhave the same label and point in the same direction but have opposite sign. The pair or arrows\ncontribute 0 to \u03b8H [P ].\nConsider finally the \u03a93 move. There are as many arrows labelled 1 before and after the move.\nAlso, the move does not change the direction of the arrows. The theorem of \u00d6stlund [18] implies\nthat it is sufficient to consider only the case where all the arrows involved in the move have the same\nsign. Thus, \u03b8H [P ] has the same value on LHS and RHS of an \u03a93 move.\n\u0003\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] is not a GP V finite-type\nLemma 9 (proof of Theorem 2). If P is the Gaussian parity, then \u03b8L,R\ninvariant of order n for any n.\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n11\n\nProof. Consider a fractional twist sequence of type FSZ which is based on the empty Gauss diagram\nn1\non R. The invariant \u03b8L\n[P ] is nonzero on the even terms of the fractional twist sequence and zero\non the odd terms of the twist sequence. Since it is nonconstant and has infinitely many zeros, it\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] is not a\ncannot be a polynomial on this fractional twist sequence. Hence, by Theorem 4, \u03b8L,R\nGP V finite-type invariant of order n for any n\n\u0003\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] can be represented by a combinatorial P -formula. The\nIt will now be shown that \u03b8L,R\nargument utilizes the discrete derivative. Recall that if F : Z \u2192 G, where G is an abelian group,\nthe discrete derivative at x is given by:\n\n(\u2202F )(x) = F (x + 1) \u2212 F (x).\nThe process can be iterated to find higher order discrete derivatives: (\u2202 n F )(x) = \u2202(\u2202 n\u22121 F )(x). Also\nset \u2202 0 to be the identity function. If F : Zm \u2192 G, partial derivatives may be defined by:\n(\u2202i F )(x1 , x2 , . . . , xi , . . . xn ) = F (x1 , x2 , . . . , xi + 1, . . . xn ) \u2212 F (x1 , x2 , . . . , xi , . . . xn ).\nIt is easy to see that \u2202i \u2202j = \u2202j \u2202i and hence the equality of mixed partials also holds in the discrete\ncase.\nTo define discrete power series, a notion of power function is defined. For \u03b1 \u2208 N, define:\nz \u03b1 = z(z \u2212 1)(z \u2212 2) * . . . * (z \u2212 \u03b1 + 1).\nFor \u03b1 = 0, define z 0 = 1. If \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) is an n-tuple of nonnegative integers, we define\nz \u03b1 = z1\u03b11 * . . . * zn\u03b1n and \u2202 \u03b1 = \u22021\u03b11 * * * \u2202n\u03b1n The degree of z \u03b1 is given by |\u03b1| = \u03b11 + \u03b12 + . . . + \u03b1n . The\nfactorial of \u03b1 is \u03b1! = \u03b11 !\u03b12 ! * . . . * \u03b1n !. The discrete power series of F , \u03a3F : Zm \u2192 G is defined to be:\nX (\u2202 \u03b1 F )(~0)\nz\u03b1.\n\u03a3F (z1 , z2 , . . . , zm ) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03b1!\n|\u03b1|\u2264n\n\nA straightforward application of the binomial theorem shows that \u03a3F = F (see for example [4]). This\nis the key observation for finding combinatorial formulae. Let Z\u2264n [z1 , z2 ] denote the polynomials\nwith integer coefficients in the variables z1 and z2 having total degree at most n. Denote by B\u2264n\nthose products of binomial coefficients as follows:\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u001a\u0012\nn2\nn1\n: k1 + k2 \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 ki \u2264 ni .\nB\u2264n =\nk2\nk1\nLemma 10.

Note that the formula for T = L\u2295 \u2212 L\u2296 + R\u2295 \u2212 R\u2296 is invariant under the virtualization move.\nThen T n is a virtualization invariant.

Let Bn denote the group of dashed arrow diagrams where all the arrows are labelled 1 and\nhave no signs. Let \u2206|Q3|n denote those commutativity relations having exactly n unsigned arrows,\nBn\n. It is easy to see that there is a surjection Bn \u2192 Kn\nall of which are labelled 1. Define Bn = h\u2206|Q3|\nni\n(see [3, 20]). Hence there is an injection HomZ (Kn , Q) \u2192 HomZ (Bn , Q).\nLet \u03b2i denote the equivalence class of diagrams in Bn which have i arrows pointing right and n \u2212 i\narrows pointing left. It is clear from the commutativity relations that Bn is a free abelian group\nwhich is generated by the n + 1 elements \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2n . Moreover, the rank of Bn is n + 1.\nTo complete the proof, it remains to show that the composition below is a surjection:\nHomZ (Tn , Q)\n\n/ HomZ (Kn , Q)\n\n/ HomZ (Bn , Q) .\n\nn1 ,n2\n[P ] where n1 + n2 = n.

This completes the\nproof of Theorem 2.\n5. Theorem 3: Decomposing GPV Formulae\nIn the present section, it is shown how to decompose a homogeneous GPV combinatorial formula\ninto an even part and an odd part. For the Gaussian parity, it is shown that the even and odd parts\nare of Kauffman finite-type but not GPV finite-type whenever the original formula is nonconstant\non the classical knots. In addition we give an example to show that not all invariants of order 2 in\nO2 arise from functorality. These sections establish the proof of Theorem 3.\n5.1. Functorality, the Polyak Algebra, and Even Parts of GPV Formulae. The parity\nenhanced Polyak algebra is an extension of the notion of combinatorial formulae for finite-type\ninvariants of classical knots. Recall the definition of the Polyak algebra from [8]. Let A be the set\nof dashed signed arrow diagrams. For relations, we have P1, P2, and P3 which are simply Q1, Q2,\nand Q3 with all the labels erased. Set \u2206P = hP1, P2, P3i and, as before, An the set of diagrams\nhaving more than n arrows. Then we define:\nP=\n\nZ[A]\nZ[A]\n, Pn =\n, \u03c0 P : P \u2192 Pn .\n\u2206P\nhAn , \u2206P i n\n\nFor v \u2208 HomZ (Pn , Q), the composition v \u25e6 \u03c0n \u25e6 I is a finite-type invariant of virtual knots, where:\nX\nI(D) =\ni(D).\nD\u2032 \u2282D\n\n\f14\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\nThe sum is taken over all subdiagrams of D. On the other hand, we have the even arrow groups\nthat arise from a projection of Qn . Let O1 denote those diagrams in A(1,0) which have the label 1\nat some arrow. Then define:\nQn\nQn\n, En :=\n.\n\u03c0nE : Q \u2192\nhO1 i\nhO1 i\nWe will show that certain combinatorial P -formulae are inherited from the Polyak groups. The\nresult follows essentially from functorality. To be precise, let P be any parity and let f : D \u2192 D\ndenote the map which deletes all the arrows in a diagram which are odd relative to P . The map f\nis called the functorial map.\nLemma 15. Let P be any parity and f : D \u2192 D be the functorial map. If D1 \u21cb D2 is a Reidemeister\nmove on Gauss diagrams, then either f (D1 ) = f (D2 ) or f (D1 ) \u21cb f (D2 ). Hence, if K1 and K2\nare virtual knots having Gauss diagrams D1 and D2 , respectively, and K1\u2032 and K2\u2032 are virtual knots\nhaving Gauss diagrams f (D1 ) and f (D2 ), then either K1\u2032 = K2\u2032 or K1\u2032 and K2\u2032 are equivalent by a\nReidemeister move and some detour moves.\nProof. If the affected arrows in the move contain only even arrows, then f (D1 ) \u21cb f (D2 ) as moves\non diagrams. If the affected arrows contain any odd arrows (so that the move is an \u03a92 or \u03a93 move),\nthen f (D1 ) = f (D2 ).\n\u0003\nThe map f indeed has the properties of a functor. In the present case of combinatorial P formulae, it is seen that f behaves nicely with respect to the commutative diagram below. Indeed,\nlet \u03b7 : Z[A] \u2192 Z[A(1,0) ] be the map which labels every arrow of every diagram as 0. Let \u03b7 e :\nZ[A(1,0) ] \u2192 Z[A(1,0) ] be the map which projects any diagram with an arrow labelled one to the zero\nelement of the group. The above lemma shows that the following diagram commutes and descends\nto the quotient groups P and Q.\nI[P ]\n\nZ[D]\n\n/ Z[A(1,0) ]\n\u03b7e\n\nf\n\n\u000f\nZ[D]\n\n\u000f\nI\n\n/ Z[A]\n\n\u03b7\n\n/ Z[A(1,0) ]\n\nA consequence of this result is the following lemma which identifies the even arrow groups with the\nPolyak groups.\nLemma 16. For every parity P , there is an isomorphism \u03b7n : Pn \u2192 En for all n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}.\nFor F \u2208 Z[A], define the even part of F to be F e = \u03b7(F ). The previous lemma guarantees that\nif F is a GPV combinatorial formula of order \u2264 n, then hhF e , *ii \u2208 HomZ (En , Q).\nIn the Gaussian parity, every arrow in the Gauss diagram D of a classical knot is labelled 0.\nHence it follows that hF, I(D)i = hhF e , I[P ](D)ii for every GPV combinatorial formula F . It is in\nthis sense that the parity enhanced formulae extend the GPV formulae for finite-type invariants of\nclassical knots.\n5.2. Odd parts of GPV formulae. The second part of the proof of Theorem 3 is to show that the\ncomplement of the even part of a homogeneous GPV formula is a combinatorial P -formula. We will\ndefine the odd part of a homogeneous formula and prove that it is in fact a combinatorial P -formula.\nAn homogeneous GPV combinatorial formula of order n is a GPV combinatorial formula F having\nexactly n arrows in every summand. Examples of order 2 are the invariants v21 and v22 . Also, there\nis the well-known Casson invariant. For order three, there exist examples which have been found by\na Mathematica program (see Figure 7).\nRecall that a GPV combinatorial formulae of order \u2264 n is an element P\nF \u2208 Z[A] where every summand has \u2264 n arrows. Hence F may be written uniquely as F = D\u2208A \u03b1D D for some\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n1\n\n-1\n+++\n+1\n+++\n\n-1\n\n++\n\n-1\n+++\n\n+1\n\n+1\n\n+\n\n15\n\n+++\n\n++\n\n+\n\n++\n\n+\n\n-1\n\n++\n\n+\n\nFigure 7.

If\nF =\ncoeff(D, F ) * D is a GPV combinatorial formula that is homogeneous of order n, define F o\nD\u2208A\n\nas follows. If coeff(D, F ) 6= 0, the contribution to F o is the sum over all labellings of the arrows of\nD with zeros and ones so that the result has at least one arrow labelled 1. Hence there are a total\nof 2n \u2212 1 diagrams in F o arising from the contribution of D. This sum will be denoted by:\nX\nD(1) ,\nD(1) \u2282D\n\nwhere the sum is over all 2n \u2212 1 ways that the arrows can be labelled so that the result has at least\none odd arrow. Define\nX X\nFo =\ncoeff(D, F ) * D(1) .\nD\u2208A D(1) \u2282D\n\nIf n = 0 and F is the empty diagram, we define F o = 0.\nThe odd part of a GPV formula can be considered as a functional on a projection of Qn . Indeed,\nlet En denote those subdiagrams which have \u2265 n arrows labelled 0. Let An denote those diagrams\nwhich have fewer than n arrows. We define projections as follows:\n\u03c0nO : Qn \u2192\n\nQn\nQn\n, On :=\n.\nn\nhEn , A i\nhEn , An i\n\nThe distinct nonzero equivalence classes in On all have representatives having n arrows, not all of\nwhich are labelled 0.\nLemma 17 (proof of Theorem 3). If F is a GPV combinatorial formula on S 1 or R which is\nhomogeneous of order n, then:\nhhF o , *ii \u2208 HomZ (On , Q) .\nHence, if P is any parity, hhF o , I[P ](*)ii is an invariant of virtual knots (or virtual long knots).\nProof. The formula vanishes on all diagrams having more than n arrows, less than n arrows, or n\neven arrows. Hence, it is sufficient to prove that hhF o , rii = 0 for all r \u2208 \u2206Q.\nQ1: Since F is a GPV invariant. Any summand D in F having an isolated arrow must have\ncoeff(D, F ) = 0. By construction of F o , it follows that hhF o , Q1ii = 0.\nQ2: We have that hF, *i satisfies all P2 relations. Since F is homogeneous of order n, the P2\n\n\f16\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\nrelations may be divided into two types:\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n= 0,\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n+\n\n= 0.\n\nThe same division occurs in the Q2 relations for F o . The two arrows involved in the Q2 relation are\neither both labelled 0 or both labelled 1. If they are both labelled 1, any diagram containing them\nhas at least one arrow labelled 1. Hence, the value of F o on the two types agrees exactly with the\nvalue of F . Thus, hhF o , Q2ii = 0.\nOn the other hand, suppose that the arrows are both labelled 0. Then the diagram will be counted\nonly when there is an arrow outside the drawn interval which is labelled 1. In this case, it occurs in\nall three diagrams in the P2 relation. Hence the value of F o agrees with the value of F on the two\ntypes and hhF o , Q2ii = 0.\nQ3: Since F is homogeneous of order n, the P3 relations also split into two types:\n\u03b5\n\ni\n\nA:\n\nj\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nk\n\nj' \u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nk\n\nk' \u03b5\n\n+\n\nk' \u03b5\n\n+\n\nB:\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\n+\n\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nk\n\n\u03b5\n\n=\n\nj' \u03b5\n\ni\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\n=\n\nj' \u03b5\n\n,\n\ni'\n\u03b5\n\nk' \u03b5\n\ni'\n\u03b5\n\n.\n\nThe same division occurs for F o in Q3.\nThe sets {i, j, k} and {i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 } contain either three arrows labelled 0 or two arrows labelled 1.\nSuppose that all three are labelled 0. Consider first the six term relation A. The only way that\nany of the six diagrams is counted is if there is an arrow outside the drawn intervals which is labelled\n1. This arrow appears in all six diagrams, whence the value of F o on the relation agrees exactly with\nthe value of F on the relation. Hence, hhF o , LHS(Q3) \u2212 RHS(Q3)ii = 0. Similarly, B is satisfied if\nall three drawn arrows are labelled 0.\nSuppose that there are exactly two arrows in each of {i, j, k} and {i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 } which are labelled\n1. For the relation, the label on x \u2208 {i, j, k} agrees with the label on x\u2032 \u2208 {i\u2032 , i\u2032 , k \u2032 }. Moreover,\nany choice of two arrows from the sets {i, j, k} and {i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 } contains at least one arrow which is\nlabelled 1. Therefore, each diagram in the relation A has at least one odd arrow. The diagrams\nin B also have at least one arrow labelled 1. Thus, F o agrees with F on all such relations and\nhhF o , LHS(Q3) \u2212 RHS(Q3)ii = 0.\n\u0003\n5.3. Even/Odd Decomposition Theorem. The main part of Theorem 3 is the decomposition\ntheorem.\nLemma 18 (proof of Theorem 3). Let F be a GPV combinatorial formula which is homogeneous\nof order n. Then for any parity P , there is decomposition of F into its even and odd parts:\nhF, I(*)i = hhF o , I[P ](*)ii + hhF e , I[P ](*)ii .\nProof. Suppose that n \u2265 1. Let D \u2208 D and D\u2032 \u2282 P (D) be a subdiagram with corresponding arrows\nlabelled as prescribed by the parity. If D\u2032 does not have exactly n arrows, then LHS and RHS of\n\n\fPARITY AND EXOTIC COMBINATORIAL FORMULAE\n\n17\n\nboth equations are zero regardless of any parity considerations. Assume then that D\u2032 has precisely\nn arrows.\nSuppose first that all the arrows of D\u2032 are labelled zero. Then hhF o , i(D\u2032 )ii = 0 and hF, i(D\u2032 )i =\nhhF e , i(D\u2032 )ii.\nOn the other hand, suppose that at least one of the arrows in D\u2032 is labelled one. Then hhF e , i(D\u2032 )ii =\n0. If D\u2032 (forgetting all numerical markings) satisfies coeff(D\u2032 , F ) = 0, then the desired decomposition\nis trivially true. If coeff(D\u2032 , F ) 6= 0 then we have by definition of F o that:\nhF, i(D\u2032 )i = coeff(D\u2032 , F ) = hhF o , i(D\u2032 )ii .\nThus, the formula holds. If n = 0, then F is the empty diagram. Since, F e is the empty diagram\nand F o = 0, the formula also holds in this case.\n\u0003\n\nExample: A natural question to ask is whether there are any invariants in On which do not arise\nfrom functorality. Indeed, there are combinatorial P -formulae whose associated invariant cannot be\nwritten as a linear combination of the even and odd parts of GPV formulae. Consider for example\nthe formula F1 in Figure 3 and let P denote the Gaussian parity. Let D denote the Gauss diagram\nin Figure 5. As mentioned in Section 3.2, we have that hhF1 , I[P ](D)ii = \u22122. On the other hand,\nif F21 and F22 denote the combinatorial formula for the generators v21 and v22 of the Polyak group\nP2 , then:\no\ne\no\no\nhhF21\n, I[P ](D)ii = hhF21\n, I[P ](D)ii = hhF22\n, I[P ](D)ii = hhF22\n, I[P ](D)ii = 0.\n\nHence, for the Gaussian parity, F1 does not arise from functorality in the sense that is not a linear\ncombination of the even and odds part of a GP V formula.\n5.4. Even and Odd Parts are not of GPV Finite-Type. To complete the last part of Theorem\n3, it is shown that in the Gaussian parity, the even and odd parts of a homogeneous GPV formula\nF of order n are not of GPV finite-type whenever F is nonconstant on classical knots. The main\ntechnique of the proof is twist lattices.\nLemma 19 (proof of Theorem 3). If F is a homogeneous GPV combinatorial formula of degree\nn > 0 which is nonconstant on the set of classical knots, and P is the Gaussian parity, then its even\npart F e and its odd part F o are not of GPV finite-type of order m for any m.\nProof. Let vF (*) = hF, I(*)i. There is a classical knot on which vF is not zero. Its Gauss diagram D\nhas all of its arrows even in the Gaussian parity.\nWe construct a fractional twist lattice \u03a6D : Zn \u2192 D on D as follows. For each arrow, base a\nfractional twist sequence of type FBZ on the intervals which lie immediately to the right and left\nof the arrow tail. Then \u03a6D (~0) = D and if z = (z1 , . . . , zn ) is an n-tuple of odd integers, then\nevery arrow of \u03a6D (z) is odd in the Gaussian parity. Since vF is of GPV finite-type, vF \u25e6 \u03a6D is a\npolynomial of order \u2264 n. Suppose that F e generates a GPV finite-type invariant u of order \u2264 t.\nThen u \u25e6 \u03a6D is a polynomial of order \u2264 t. Let \u03b4 : Z \u2192 Zn denote the diagonal embedding. Since\nu \u25e6 \u03a6D is a polynomial of order \u2264 t, u \u25e6 \u03a6D \u25e6 \u03b4 is a polynomial in a single variable of order \u2264 t.\nSince u \u25e6 \u03a6D \u25e6 \u03b4(0) = vF (D) 6= 0 and u \u25e6 \u03a6D \u25e6 \u03b4(1) = 0, u \u25e6 \u03a6D \u25e6 \u03b4 is not constant. However,\nu \u25e6 \u03a6D \u25e6 \u03b4(2z + 1) = 0 for all z \u2208 Z. As there is no such polynomial in a single variable, it follows\nthat F e does not generate a GPV finite-type invariant of order \u2264 t for any t.\nNow, since F gives a polynomial on every fractional twist lattice, the even/odd decomposition\ntheorem implies that either both hhF e , I[P ](*)ii and hhF o , I[P ](*)ii are polynomials or both are not\npolynomials. By the preceding paragraphs, we see that there is always some twist lattice in which\nat least one of them is not a polynomial. Thus, neither the invariant obtained from F e nor the\ninvariant obtained from F o is of GPV finite-type.\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nMICAH WHITNEY CHRISMAN AND VASSILY OLEGOVICH MANTUROV\n\n6.
