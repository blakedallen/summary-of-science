INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of the late dynamical evolution of binaries made of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes)\nis important because such systems are the most promising candidate sources for interferometric gravitational-wave\ndetectors such as LIGO and VIRGO. In particular, the global structure of the gravitational waveform emitted by such\na binary sensitively depends on the frequency at which the system's orbital evolution changes from a gravitationalradiation-driven inspiral phase to a plunge phase followed by coalescence [1,2].\nIn the test-mass limit (\u03bc \u226a M ) the orbital dynamics is that of a test particle (of mass \u03bc) moving in a Schwarzschild\nbackground (of mass M ). A very important qualitative feature of circular orbits in such a background is the existence of\na Last Stable Orbit (LSO) located at the (area) radius RLSO = 6GM/c2 . When considering the effect of gravitationalradiation reaction, one expects the test-particle motion to change abruptly near RLSO from a slow inspiral to a fast\nplunge. By analogy, one believes that the motion of a compact binary made of comparable masses, m1 and m2 , will\nexhibit a similar transition from inspiral to plunge, with the location of the transition being mainly determined by\nthe existence of a Last Stable Orbit in the conservative part of the two-body Hamiltonian.\nSeveral authors have tried to estimate the location of the LSO in comparable-mass (compact) binaries. An early\nanalytical estimate was made by Clark and Eardley [3] using the first post-Newtonian (1PN) Hamiltonian. Some\nauthors [4\u20136] tried to use initial value formalisms to locate the LSO. However, the initial value approaches used in\nthese works assume a conformally flat metric, and therefore do not correctly incorporate the well known second postNewtonian (2PN) dynamics [7\u20139]. In this work we shall take the view that a correct incorporation of all 2PN effects\nis a necessary (if maybe not sufficient) prerequisite for an accurate determination of the location of the LSO. Previous\ntreatments that used the full 2PN dynamics to try to analytically determine the location of the LSO include Refs.\n[10\u201312,1,13]. The aim of the present work is to extend these PN-based analytic determinations of the LSO to the third\npost-Newtonian (3PN) level. The conservative part of the 3PN Hamiltonian for two point masses has been obtained\nin 1998 by Jaranowski and Sch\u00e4fer [14], though with some remaining ambiguity due to the need to regularize the\ndivergent integrals entailed by the use of point-like sources. The determination of the 3PN dynamics has been recently\ncompleted by deriving the Hamiltonian in a non-mass-centered frame, and by fixing a certain momentum-dependent\n1\n\n\fregularization ambiguity [15]. Recently, we have extracted from the 3PN Hamiltonian of Ref. [14] all its dynamical\ninvariants, i.e. all the functions linking dynamical quantities which do not depend on the choice of coordinates in\nphase-space [16]. In this paper, we shall use several of these 3PN invariants to determine the location of the LSO.\nSome of the methods of LSO determination that we shall use below generalize previous works [1,13], but others are\nnew.\nII. METHODS DIRECTLY BASED ON DYNAMICAL INVARIANTS\n\nBefore embarking on the discussion of the methods we shall use here to extract the LSO from PN expansions, let\nus stress that the basic theme underlying our endeavours is the following: Our problem is to extract some semi-nonperturbative information from (badly convergent) perturbation expansions. We shall do that by using several types\nof \"resummation methods\". The basic idea of all resummation methods is simply the following: to complete the\ninformation contained in the first few terms of a perturbative expansion f (z) = c0 + c1 z + * * * + cn z n + O(z n+1 )\nby injecting some non-perturbative information about the global behaviour (if possible in the complex plane) of the\nexact function f (z). The amount of global information one has about the function f (z) determines the best type\nof resummation method to use. For instance, if the only information at our disposal is that the function f (z) is\n(probably) meromorphic in the complex z-plane, then the best, all-purpose method is to use Pad\u00e9 approximants. If\nwe knew more about the location of the singularities of f (z) in the complex plane one might contemplate to use other\nmethods (e.g. change of independent variable, Borel transform, . . .).\nIn this paper, we shall use two distinct classes of methods for extracting the (invariant) location of the LSO from the\nknowledge of the PN-expanded dynamics. The first class of methods (which was introduced in Ref. [1]) is discussed\nin the present Section. The second class will be discussed in the next Section. The first class of methods is based on\nthe combination of three ideas:\n(i) to work only with invariant functions;\n(ii) to make a maximal use of the known, exact functional form of invariant functions in the test-mass limit\n(\u03bd \u2261 m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 )2 \u2192 0) and to assume some structural stability when the parameter \u03bd is turned on;\n(iii) to use Pad\u00e9 approximants to represent the invariant functions which are (because of (ii)) expected to be\nmeromorphic functions of their argument.\nThis method was applied in Ref. [1] to the two invariant functions which play an essential role in the gravitationaldamping-driven inspiral of a binary system: the binding energy E(x) of a circular orbit, and the gravitational-wave\nflux F (x) emitted by a circular orbit, both being considered as functions of the (dimensionless) invariant parameter\n\u0012\n\u00132/3\nGM \u03c9\nx\u2261\n,\n(2.1)\nc3\nwhere M \u2261 m1 + m2 denotes the total mass of the binary, and \u03c9 the orbital angular frequency along a circular orbit.\nBefore introducing some variations on this method, let us motivate the interest of using the three ideas (i)\u2013(iii)\nabove. First, we recall that the PN expansions of non-invariant, i.e. gauge-dependent, functions can have (and do\nhave, in some gauges) worse convergence properties than the PN expansions of invariant functions. For instance, the\nPN expansion of the gravitational-wave flux, from a test mass in circular orbit, say FTM , considered as a function\nof the harmonic-coordinate parameter \u03b3 \u2261 GM/(c2 rharmonic ), is such that the 1PN \"correction\" to the leading\n\"quadrupole\" result becomes fractionally larger than 100% (while being negative!) for a radius rharmonic larger than\nthe LSO (which is at rLSO = 5GM/c2 in harmonic coordinates). More precisely, if one formally writes down the\nexpansion of FTM (\u03b3), in powers of \u03b3, near the LSO (i.e. for \u03b3 near 1/5) one gets a series numerically proportional\nto: 1 \u2212 1.74 (5\u03b3) + 1.12 (5\u03b3)3/2 + 1.29 (5\u03b3)2 + * * *, i.e. a series whose first terms do not exhibit any convergence near\nthe LSO. By contrast, the flux FTM expanded in terms of the invariant parameter x, Eq. (2.1), (xLSO = 1/6 in the\ntest-mass limit) has a more reasonable expansion proportional to 1 \u2212 0.619 (6x) + 0.855 (6x)3/2 \u2212 0.137 (6x)2 + * * *.\nStill, it is clear that one needs some resummation technique for summing a series as slowly converging as FTM (x). It\nwas shown in great detail in Ref. [1], by making use both of the known analytical results on high-order (5.5PN) terms\nin the post-Newtonian expansion of the test-mass flux function FTM (x) [17], and of the existence of a pole-like blow\nup of FTM (x) at x = xlight ring = 1/3, that one could considerably speed up the convergence of the straightforward\n(Taylor-like) PN series, by replacing it by a suitably defined sequence of Pad\u00e9 approximants (see, notably, Fig. 3 in\n[1]).\nTo further illustrate the idea (ii), and the need for an acceleration of convergence, let us recall the treatment of the\nenergy function E(x) introduced in [1]. In this paper we follow [16] in defining the dimensionless energy function\nE\u2261\n\nE R \u2212 M c2\n,\n\u03bcc2\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere E R is the total (\"relativistic\") energy of the binary system (including the rest-mass contribution), and where\nM \u2261 m1 + m2 ,\n\n\u03bc\u2261\n\nm1 m2\n,\nm1 + m2\n\n\u03bd\u2261\n\n\u03bc\nm1 m2\n.\n=\nM\n(m1 + m2 )2\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor notational simplicity we shall henceforth use units such that c = 1. Note that the energy function used in [1] was\nE DIS \u2261 (E R \u2212 M )/M = \u03bdE here .\nBecause the argument x is, from its definition (2.1), of formal order O(c\u22122 ), the knowledge of the dynamics at, say,\nthe nth post-Newtonian (nPN) order entails the knowledge of the expansion of the ratio E(x)/x up to xn :\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nE(x; \u03bd) = \u2212 x 1 + E1 (\u03bd) x + E2 (\u03bd) x2 + * * * + En (\u03bd) xn + O(xn+1 ) .\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n[The term \u2212 21 x corresponds to the Newtonian binding energy E NR = \u2212 21 \u03bc v 2 . Then the term E1 (\u03bd) x, for instance,\nrepresents the fractional 1PN effects, etc.] The symmetric mass ratio \u03bd, Eq. (2.3), enters the expansion coefficients\nEn (\u03bd) as a parameter. At present, only E1 (\u03bd), E2 (\u03bd) and E3 (\u03bd) are known (with some ambiguity for the 3PN\ncoefficient E3 (\u03bd)). They were written down in [16] and will be repeated below. On the other hand, in the testmass limit \u03bd \u2192 0, the coefficients En (0) are known (in principle) for any n. What is more, the exact expression of\nE(x; \u03bd = 0) is known:\n1 \u2212 2x\nE(x; \u03bd = 0) = \u221a\n\u22121.\n1 \u2212 3x\n\n(2.5)\n\nIt is known (see, e.g., [1]) that the location of the LSO corresponds just to the minimum of the function E(x)\n((dE(x)/dx)xLSO = 0). Therefore, it would seem that the most straightforward way of locating the LSO is to consider\nthe successive \"Taylor approximants\" of E(x), say ETn (x) (defined for each integer n as the R.H.S. of Eq. (2.4),\nwithout the O (xn+1 ) error term), and to solve the equations dETn (x)/dx = 0. Let us see what this gives in the\ntest-mass limit where the Taylor expansion of Eq. (2.5) is known:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n3\n27 2 675 3 3969 4\nE(x; \u03bd = 0) = \u2212 x 1 \u2212 x \u2212\nx \u2212\nx \u2212\nx \u2212 *** .\n(2.6)\n2\n4\n8\n64\n128\nTn\nn\nThe successive \"Taylor\" estimates of xLSO , or better xTLSO\n/xexact\nLSO \u2261 6 xLSO , are found to be (in the test-mass case):\n\n6 xT1 = 4 ;\n\n6 xT2 = 1.49284 ;\n\n6 xT3 = 1.17565 ;\n\n6 xT4 = 1.07680 .\n\n(2.7)\n\n[To avoid confusion note that we use here the convention that 'Tn ' corresponds to the nPN approximation, i.e. a\n(v/c)2n -accurate result, while in Ref. [1] 'Tn ' referred to (v/c)n -accuracy, i.e. to the n2 PN approximation.] From Eq.\n(2.1) the corresponding values of the orbital frequency at the LSO, scaled to the exact value, \u03c9\nb \u2261 \u03c9/\u03c9 exact = (6x)3/2 ,\nread\n\u03c9\nb T1 = 8 ;\n\n\u03c9\nb T2 = 1.82398 ;\n\n\u03c9\nb T3 = 1.27472 ;\n\n\u03c9\nb T4 = 1.11739 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nAs the value of the frequency at the LSO is the most important observable one wishes to know (for data analysis\npurposes), one should reject any method which does not have the prospect of determining it to, say, better than about\n10%. The test-mass results1 (2.8) suggest that, if the dynamics is known only up to the 3PN level, straightforward\nTaylor approximants of the energy function E(x) do not converge fast enough to determine satisfactorily the location\nof the LSO. [The 4PN level might barely suffice, but it seems anyway excluded that one will be able to analytically\nderive the 4PN dynamics.]\nThis preliminary discussion motivates the necessity of boosting up the convergence of the series (2.4) or (2.6). This\nis here that the ideas (ii) and (iii) enter. The exact test-mass result (2.5) suggests (under the assumption that the\n\u03bd 6= 0 case represents a structurally stable deformation of the \u03bd = 0 limit) that the function E(x; \u03bd), for \u03bd 6= 0, will\nhave a branch-cut singularity (at some point x0 = 31 +O(\u03bd)) in the complex x plane. It is, a priori, much better to work\nwith functions which are meromorphic in the complex plane, because we can then make use of Pad\u00e9 approximants,\n\n1\n\nThe logic here is to use the known convergence properties of the \u03bd = 0 limit to estimate the convergence when \u03bd 6= 0. It is,\nindeed, unlikely that turning on \u03bd will drastically improve the convergence properties.\n\n3\n\n\fwhich are efficient tools for accurately representing meromorphic functions. This suggests to work with some (to be\ndefined) new invariant energy function that is known to be meromorphic in the test-mass limit.\nLooking at Eq. (2.5) one is tempted to consider the square of the function 1 + E. However, Ref. [1] remarked that\nthe usual test-mass limit definition of this function, namely (m2 \u226a m1 being the test-mass orbiting m1 )\n1+E \u2261\n\nE2R\nm2\n\n(2.9)\n\nwith\nR\nEtot\n= m1 + E2R + O(m22 ) = m1 \u2212\n\np\u03bc1 p2\u03bc\n+ O(m22 ) ,\nm1\n\n(2.10)\n\nlooks unnaturally asymmetric with respect to the labels 1 and 2. [Essentially, this asymmetry comes from the fact,\nhidden in the symmetric definition (2.2), that E2R represents the sum of the rest-mass energy of m2 alone and of the\nbinding energy of the binary system.] Ref. [1] therefore suggested to introduce the more symmetric function\n\u03c6(s) \u2261\n\ns \u2212 m21 \u2212 m22\n(E R )2 \u2212 m21 \u2212 m22\n\u2261\n2 m1 m2\n2 m1 m2\n\n(2.11)\n\nof the Mandelstam invariant s \u2261 \u2212(p\u03bc1 + p\u03bc2 )2 \u2261 (E R )2 . Indeed, in the test-mass limit\n\u03c6(s) \u2261 \u2212\n\np\u03bc1 p2\u03bc\nER\n1 \u2212 2x\n\u2243 2 =1+E = \u221a\n.\nm1 m2\nm2\n1 \u2212 3x\n\n(2.12)\n\nIt is then natural to define the function e(x) (or rather 1 + e(x)), by setting\n\u00012\n1 + e(x) \u2261 \u03c6(s(x)) =\n\n(E R )2 \u2212 m21 \u2212 m22\n2 m1 m2\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(2.13)\n\nThen, 1 + e(x), being equal to (1 \u2212 2x)2 /(1 \u2212 3x) in the test-mass limit, i.e. (after subtraction of the trivial constant\n1)\ne(x; \u03bd = 0) = \u2212x\n\n1 \u2212 4x\n,\n1 \u2212 3x\n\n(2.14)\n\none expects the function e(x; \u03bd) to be meromorphic in x when \u03bd 6= 0 (with a pole located at some xpole = 31 + O(\u03bd)).\nThis finally leads to the following \"P -approximant\"-improved method for locating the LSO: starting from the\nTaylor approximants (T -approximants) of the original E(x) function, Eq. (2.4), compute first the corresponding\nT -approximants of the new e(x) function, say\n\u0002\n\u0003\ne(x) = \u2212x 1 + e1 (\u03bd) x + e2 (\u03bd) x2 + e3 (\u03bd) x3 + O(x4 ) .\n(2.15)\nThen construct a sequence of Pad\u00e9s of the Taylor-expanded e(x):\n\nePn (x) \u2261 Plk [Tn [e(x)]] ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere k + l = n. Here k and l are the degrees of the polynomials Nk (x) and Dl (x) entering the Pad\u00e9 Plk (x) =\nNk (x)/Dl (x). It is known that, generically, the Pad\u00e9 improvements are best when one is near the \"diagonal\", i.e.\nwhen |k \u2212 l| is \"small\" compared to k and l. When dealing with a function f (x) that is expected to have a pole at\nsome x0 6= 0, one imposes the constraint l > 0. At 1PN order this uniquely fixes the values of k and l, namely k = 0\nand l = 1. At 2PN order the Pad\u00e9 closest to the diagonal is that with k = 1 and l = 1. At 3PN order there are two\npossible Pad\u00e9s near the diagonal, namely k = 1 and l = 2, or k = 2 and l = 1. In this work we shall use the latter\none (P12 ) because we found it to be more robust under variations of the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the\nPad\u00e9ed function. (One aspect of this robustness is that the existence of a real pole in this Pad\u00e9 is always ensured,\nwhile this is not the case for the other 3PN possibility: P21 .)\nNote also that Pad\u00e9s are originally defined only for series of the regular type \u03c3(x) = c0 + c1 x + * * * with c0 6= 0.\nWhen dealing with a function of the type fp (x) = xp \u03c3(x) with some relative integer p, we shall, by convention, define\nany Pad\u00e9 of fp (x) as being (k + l = n)\n4\n\n\fPlk [Tn [fp (x)]] \u2261 xp Plk [Tn [x\u2212p fp (x)]] .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe \"ePn -estimate\" of the location of the LSO is then defined as the value xPn at which ePn (x) reaches a minimum.\n[It is easily seen that e(x) follows the variations of E(x), and in particular that it reaches a minimum at the same\nplace as E(x).]\nWe spent some time explaining in detail on one example our general Pad\u00e9-improved\u2013test-mass-limit-motivated\napproach because we are going to extend it to several other invariant functions. In this (and the next) section, we\npresent our various methodologies. The 3PN results obtained by them will be presented in a later section.\nThe introduction of the function e(x) has two defects. First, it is not unique because\n\u221a we do not know for sure\nwhether the function (\u03c6(s))2 , Eq. (2.13), is a \"better\" invariant than (1 + E)2 = (1 + ( s \u2212 M )/\u03bc)2 . Second, the\nPadeing of e(x) starts giving meaningful results only at the 2PN level. Indeed the 1PN expansion of e(x), in the\ntest-mass limit, e(x; \u03bd = 0) = \u2212x (1 \u2212 x + O(x2 )), yields a Pad\u00e9 eP1 (x; \u03bd = 0) = \u2212x/(1 + x) which contains no pole\non the positive real axis, and which formally predicts an LSO (minimum of eP1 (x)) located at x = +\u221e.\nIn this paper, we propose to consider another invariant function, which is more uniquely defined, and which gives\nsensible results already at the 1PN level. Let us consider the reduced angular momentum\nj\u2261\n\nJ\nJ\n,\n=\n\u03bcGM\nGm1 m2\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere J denotes the total angular momentum of the system. In the test-mass limit the invariant function giving the\n(dimensionless) quantity j in terms of the quantity x, Eq. (2.1), reads\nj (x; \u03bd = 0) = p\n\n1\nx(1 \u2212 3x)\n\n.\n\n(2.19)\n\nThis motivates the consideration of the squared (reduced) angular momentum j 2 (x) which is expected, when \u03bd 6= 0,\nto be a meromorphic function of x, with a pole at the \"light ring\" xpole = 13 + O(\u03bd). Therefore we propose to work\nwith the Padeed form of j 2 :\njP2 n (x; \u03bd) \u2261 Plk [Tn [j 2 (x; \u03bd)]] ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith k + l = n, and the choice of l > 0 discussed above. (We use in Eq. (2.20) the convention (2.17), i.e. the factor x\u22121\nin j 2 (x) is factored before taking a Pad\u00e9.) Note that, in the\u0001 test-mass limit, if we knew only the 1PN approximation\nto the function j 2 (x), i.e. j 2 (x; \u03bd = 0) = x\u22121 1 + 3x + O(x2 ) , the procedure (2.20) would reconstruct the exact result:\njP2 1 (x; \u03bd = 0) = P10 [T1 [j 2 (x; \u03bd = 0)]] = [x(1 \u2212 3x)]\u22121 .\nIt is important to note that the perturbative information contained in the PN expansion of the function j(x) (or\nequivalently j 2 (x)) is totally equivalent (at any PN accuracy) to the information contained in, either the original\nenergy function E(x), or the new one e(x), Eq. (2.13). Indeed, the generic Hamiltonian equation \u03b8\u0307i = \u03c9i = \u2202H/\u2202Ii\nin action-angle variables (Ii , \u03b8i ) yields\n\u03c9circular =\n\ndE R\n1 dE\n=\n,\ndJ\nGM dj\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhich implies the identity\ndj(x)\ndE(x)\n= x3/2\n.\ndx\ndx\n\n(2.22)\n\nThe identity (2.22) proves the assertion just made about the identical information content in E(x) and j(x). It\nalso proves several interesting facts. First, the location of the minimum of (the exact) j(x) coincides with that of the\nminimum of (the exact) E(x) (both of them equivalently defining the LSO). Second, the existence of a branch cut\nsingularity \u221d (x0 \u2212x)\u22121/2 in either j(x) or E(x) necessarily implies the presence of a similar singularity \u221d (x0 \u2212x)\u22121/2\n(at the same location x0 ) in the other function (E(x) or j(x), respectively). This can be viewed as a confirmation of\nour generic assumption of structural stability. However, this argument also shows the ambiguities present when trying\nto work with the energy function. Indeed, if we assume that, near x0 , j(x) can be expanded as \u03c6(x)(x0 \u2212 x)\u22121/2 ,\nwhere \u03c6(x) is a smooth function, one finds from Eq. (2.22) that E(x) = \u03c8(x)(x0 \u2212 x)\u22121/2 + c, with some unknown\nconstant c. The lack of knowledge of the constant c (which a priori depends on the parameter \u03bd) implies that we do\nnot know which function (E \u2212 c (\u03bd)) we would square to get a meromorphic function with a simple pole. The same\nreasoning shows another defect of the proposal to consider the (new) function e(x). Indeed, when E(x) \u2192 \u221e the\n5\n\n\fleading term in e(x), Eq. (2.13), will be e(x) \u223c 14 \u03bd 2 E 4 (x), which will have a double pole \u221d \u03bd 2 (x0 \u2212 x)\u22122 , if j 2 (x) has\na simple pole \u221d (x0 \u2212 x)\u22121 . For all these reasons, we consider that the \"j-method\", Eq. (2.20), appears as the best\nway of locating the LSO, within the class of methods dealt with in this section.\nTo conclude this section, let us, however, mention another invariant function one might wish to consider. This\nfunction is the fourth power of the dimensionless periastron parameter 1 + k = \u03a6/(2\u03c0) considered as a function of the\nreduced angular momentum. Indeed, in the test-mass limit, and for circular orbits, one knows that [9,18,16]\n(1 + k)4 =\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n12\n.\n1\u2212 2\nj\n\n(2.23)\n\n\u00014\nWe recall that j 2 = 12 is the location of the LSO. Therefore, if we define K \u2261 (1 + k)4 = \u03a6/(2\u03c0) and y \u2261 1/j 2 , we\nmight consider\nKPn (y; \u03bd) \u2261 Plk [Tn [K(y; \u03bd)]] ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nwith k + l = n, and our canonical choice of l > 0. Then, we can take the pole of KPn (y; \u03bd) as estimate of the value\nof 1/j 2 at the LSO when \u03bd 6= 0. We consider, however, that the j-method (or any energy method for that matter)\nhas a better chance of accurately locating the LSO because it incorporates not only the information that something\nspecial (a minimum) takes place at the LSO, but also the information that the location of this minimum is a corollary\nof the presence of a blow up (j 2 \u2192 \u221e, E \u2192 \u221e) at a point, xpole , further away on the real axis. Therefore, even if the\nlocation of xpole is not known very accurately, one can hope that xLSO will be more robustly determined.\nIII. EFFECTIVE ONE-BODY METHOD\n\nIn this section, we shall turn to a rather different method, though one which also makes use of the three ideas\n(i)\u2013(iii) listed at the beginning of the previous section. This new method incorporates a fourth idea, which has been\nrecently put forward by Buonanno and Damour [13]. This fourth idea consists in mapping (through the use of invariant\nfunctions) the real two-body problem we are interested in (two masses m1 , m2 orbiting around each other) onto an\neffective \u03b3\n\"effective one-body problem\" (one mass m0 moving in some background metric, g\u03b1\u03b2\n(x )). At the 2PN level,\nRef. [13] has shown the possibility of mapping the real two-body problem onto geodesic motion in some spherically\neffective \u03b3\neffective \u03b3\n(x ; \u03bd) is a smooth deformation of the\n(x ; \u03bd). It was found that, when \u03bd 6= 0, g\u03b1\u03b2\nsymmetric metric g\u03b1\u03b2\nSchwarzschild metric. The \"mapping\nrules\"\nbetween\nthe\ntwo\nproblems\nwere\nmotivated\nby quantum considerations:\nH\n(i) the adiabatic invariants Ii = pi dqi (which are quantized in units of ~) were identified in the two problems, and\n(ii) the energies are mapped through a function Eeffective = f [Ereal ] which is, a priori, arbitrary, and which is\ndetermined in the process of matching the two problems.\neffective\nIn other words, the idea is to determine a metric g\u03b1\u03b2\nsuch that the \"energy levels\" Eeffective [Ii ] (i.e. the Hamileffective\n,\ntonian expressed in action variables, or \"Delaunay Hamiltonian\") of the bound states of a particle moving in g\u03b1\u03b2\nare in one-to-one correspondence with the two-body bound states:\nEeffective [Ii ] = f [Ereal [Ii ]] .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe unknowns of the problem are the numerical coefficients entering a spherically symmetric metric\nds2eff = \u2212A(Reff ) dt2eff +\n\nD(Reff )\n2\n2\n2\ndReff\n+ Reff\n(d\u03b8eff\n+ sin2 \u03b8eff d\u03c62eff ) ,\nA(Reff )\n\n(3.2)\n\nnamely,\nGM0\n+ a2\nR\n\n\u0012\n\nGM0\nR\n\n\u00132\n\nGM0\n+ d2\nD(R) = 1 + d1\nR\n\n\u0012\n\nGM0\nR\n\n\u00132\n\nA(R) = 1 + a1\n\n+ a3\n\n\u0012\n\nGM0\nR\n\n\u00133\n\n+ a4\n\n\u0012\n\n+ d3\n\n\u0012\n\nGM0\nR\n\n\u00133\n\n+ ***,\n\nGM0\nR\n\n\u00134\n\n+ *** ,\n\n(3.3a)\n\n(3.3b)\n\nNR\nand the coefficients entering the energy-map f (here written for the \"non-relativistic\" energies Eeff\n\u2261 Eeff \u2212 m0 ,\nNR\nEreal \u2261 Ereal \u2212 M ):\n\n6\n\n\f\"\n#\n\u0012 NR \u00133\n\u0012 NR \u00132\nNR\nNR\nNR\nEeff\nEreal\nEreal\nEreal\nEreal\n1 + \u03b11\n+ \u03b13\n+ *** .\n=\n+ \u03b12\nm0\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n(3.4)\n\nAs discussed in Ref. [13] it is natural to require that the effective mass m0 be exactly equal to the usual nonrelativistic effective mass \u03bc \u2261 m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ). One can also (by convention) choose the mass M0 entering the\neffective metric to be M0 \u2261 M = m1 + m2 . With these choices the Newtonian limit tells us that the first coefficient\nin A(R) = \u2212g00 is simply a1 = \u22122. The 1PN level then involves the coefficients a2 , d1 , and \u03b11 , while the 2PN\nand 3PN levels involve (a3 , d2 , \u03b12 ) and (a4 , d3 , \u03b13 ), respectively. In other words, at each PN level, we only have three\narbitrary coefficients to play with. This seems to be quite a small number of degrees of freedom, compared to the many\npossible coefficients which can enter the PN-expansion of the Delaunay Hamiltonian. [The Delaunay Hamiltonian\nwas determined at the 2PN level in Ref. [9], and at the 3PN level in Ref. [16].] In order to clarify the number of\nindependent equations to be satisfied when mapping the real problem onto the effective one, let us consider a generic2\nPN-expanded Hamiltonian, with the symbolic structure\ni\nh\n\u0003\n\u0002\nb NR (q, p) = p2(n+1) + 1 p2n + p2n\u22122 (np)2 + * * * + (np)2n + 1 p2(n\u22121) + * * * + (np)2(n\u22121) + * * * + 1 .

See Ref. [16] for\ndetails. Note that we follow here [13] in denoting by q, p the original (ADM-like) coordinates. We have suppressed\nall coefficients in Eq. (3.5) to display the structure. What is important for our present purpose is the total number of\ncoefficients in the nPN-level Hamiltonian (3.5). This is easily checked to be:\nCH (n) =\n\n(n + 1)(n + 2)\n+1.\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nAs explained in Ref. [13], one way (and the only explicit one) to map the real Hamiltonian (3.5) onto an effective\nHamiltonian, while keeping the action variables invariant, is to apply a canonical transformation, with generating\ne p\u2032 ) = q i p\u2032 + G(q, p\u2032 ). The most generic generating function that we need to consider has the symbolic\nfunction G(q,\ni\nstructure (at the nPN level)\n\u001b\n\u001a\ni\n1\n1 h 2(n\u22121)\np\n+ * * * + (np)2(n\u22121) + * * * + n .\n(3.7)\nGnPN (q, p) = (q * p) p2n +\nq\nq\nCorrespondingly to the pure p-dependence of the leading kinetic term in (3.5) we have written here the leading\nterm in GnPN as \u221d (qp) p2n . [It is easily shown that any term of the form (qp) p2(n\u2212k) (np)2k must have a vanishing\ncoefficient.] The number of arbitrary coefficients in the nPN-level generating function (3.7) is easily seen to be\nCG (n) = CH (n \u2212 1) =\n\nn(n + 1)\n+1.\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nFinally, the difference \u2206(n) between the number of equations to satisfy, and the number of unknowns (including the\n3 basic parameters (an+1 , dn , \u03b1n ) appearing in the effective metric and the energy-map) reads, at the nPN level\n\u2206(n) = CH (n) \u2212 CG (n) \u2212 3 = n \u2212 2 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn particular: \u2206(1) = \u22121, which means that requiring a 1PN matching leaves one degree of freedom unrestricted.\n[This freedom was used in [13] to impose the natural condition d1 = 0, i.e. that the linearized effective metric coincides\nwith Schwarzschild.] Then \u2206(2) = 0, which means that there will (barring any degeneracy) be a unique solution at\nthe 2PN level. [This was indeed the result of [13].] But \u2206(3) = +1, which means that, at the 3PN level, there is one\nmore equation to satisfy than the number of free parameters. Then the situation would get worse and worse at higher\nPN levels.\nBy explicitly performing the matching between the canonically-transformed Hamiltonian and (modulo the energy\neff\nmap (3.4)) the effective Hamiltonian of a point particle moving in some g\u03bc\u03bd\n, we have established (details will be\n\n2\n\ninformation that the leading kinetic terms in a PN Hamiltonian are given by the expansion of the free Hamiltonian\npWe use the p\np21 + m21 + p22 + m22 , so that, at the nPN level, they are \u221d p2(1+n) without dependence on n \u2261 q/q.\n\n7\n\n\fgiven below) that, if we follow Ref. [13] in imposing the natural condition d1 = 0 at the 1PN level, there are, indeed,\nCH (3) = 11 linearly independent equations, for CG (3)+ 3 = 10 unknowns, to be satisfied at the 3PN level. [No miracle\noccurred!]\nAt face value, this looks like bad news for the idea of the \"effective one-body approach\". However, we think that\nthere are acceptable ways to rescue this approach. A first cure would be to take advantage of the fact that the total\nnumber of equations at the three first PN levels (1, 2, and 3) is exactly equal to the number of unknowns (in other\nwords \u2206(1) + \u2206(2) + \u2206(3) = \u22121 + 0 + 1 = 0). Therefore if we relax the (not really necessary) constraint d1 = 0,\neff\nthere will be a unique 3PN-accurate effective metric g\u03bc\u03bd\n(and a unique energy mapping (3.4)) satisfying the necessary\nconstraints. We have verified that this is true and, for completeness, we give this unique solution in Appendix A.\nBut, we do not want to take this solution too seriously for the following reasons: (i) it does not look natural to have\nto wait to know the 3PN Hamiltonian to determine the 1PN and 2PN effective metrics; (ii) this solution looks more\ncomplicated than the 3PN Hamiltonian itself; and (iii) this trick is not expected to be sufficient to ensure the existence\nof solutions at higher PN levels. (Indeed, \u2206(n) = n \u2212 2 continues to increase.)\nWe propose therefore to consider a second (more radical, and simpler) way to cure the problem. Indeed, we have to\nface the fact that there is (probably) nothing deep in the effective-one-body approach. After all, it is just a somewhat\nartificial way of mapping the complicated two-body dynamics on a simpler one-body dynamics. There is no reason to\nassume that the one-body dynamics can, to all orders, be considered as equivalent to a simple geodesic motion. Let\nus recall that, in quantum mechanics3 , geodesic motion means a simple Klein-Gordon Lagrangian\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u03b2\nLeff = \u2212 geff (\u2207\u03c6)2 + m20 \u03c62\nwith (\u2207\u03c6)2 = geff\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6 .\n(3.10)\n\nIt is well-known that effective actions generally include, at higher orders, some higher-derivative terms: for instance\nof the type (\u2737g \u03c6)2 , (\u2207\u03c6)4 , etc. Coming back to the classical limit, i.e. to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (obtained\nby considering that \u03c6(x) = exp (i S(x)/~) with ~ \u2192 0), we should correspondingly expect that, at higher orders, the\neffective one-body \"Hamilton-Jacobi\" equation be of the generalized form\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(x) p\u03b1 p\u03b2 + A\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) p\u03b1 p\u03b2 p\u03b3 p\u03b4 + * * *\n0 = m20 + geff\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u03b1\nwith p\u03b1 = \u2202 S(x)/\u2202\nR x . \u0002If we were to use a Lagrangian\u0003 formulation, the general form (3.11) would correspond to an\naction S = \u2212m0 dseff 1 + A\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) u\u03b1 u\u03b2 u\u03b3 u\u03b4 + * * * with u\u03b1 = dx\u03b1 /dseff , i.e. to a general (perturbative) Finsler\nstructure.\n\u03b1\u03b2\nIf we use perturbatively the lowest-order \"on shell\" condition (i.e. m20 + geff\np\u03b1 p\u03b2 \u2243 0) we can (for instance)\neliminate the presence of the energy Eeff = \u2212p0 in the quartic (and higher) terms in (3.11). In other words, we can\nrestrict ourselves to considering purely spatial higher-order tensors A\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) = Aijkl (x), etc. Dimensional analysis\nshows that the quartic terms (O (p4 )) in Eq. (3.11) which can enter at the 3PN level must have a q-dependence of\nthe type Aijkl (x) \u223c q \u22122 . Finally, we are led to consider, at the 3PN accuracy, (after solving Eq. (3.11) with respect\nto the effective energy Eeff = \u2212p0 ) a generalized effective Hamiltonian of the form\ns\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0001\nA(q \u2032 )\n1\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u20322 )2 + z p\u20322 (n\u2032 * p\u2032 )2 + z (n\u2032 * p\u2032 )4\n\u2032 * p\u2032 )2 +\nb\n, (3.12)\nz\n(p\n\u2212\n1\n(n\nHeff (q , p ) = A(q \u2032 ) 1 + p\u20322 +\n1\n2\n3\nD(q \u2032 )\nq \u20322\n\nwhere\nthe quartic (in p\u2032 ) terms come from the A\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 coupling and modify the normal \"geodesic\" Hamiltonian\nq\neff (1 + g ij p\u2032 p\u2032 ). In anticipation of the need to transform (via a canonical transformation) the original coordi\u2212g00\neff i j\nnates (q, p) of the real (reduced) Hamiltonian into the coordinates of the effective dynamics, we have denoted the\nlatter by (q\u2032 , p\u2032 ).\nThis procedure introduces three new arbitrary degrees of freedom at the 3PN level: z1 , z2 , and z3 . It is clear that it\nnow becomes possible to map the real dynamics on the generalized effective dynamics (3.12). This becomes, in fact,\npossible in many ways. As we are primarily interested in (quasi-)circular orbits we shall find convenient to consider\nonly the simple case where z1 = z2 = 0, i.e. to use only z3 6= 0 as new degree of freedom. [This degree of freedom then\ndisappears in the discussion of circular orbits, which can then be considered as following essentially from a \"geodesic\"\ndynamics.]\nAn important feature of our proposal (3.11) is that it is clearly general enough to allow for the existence of solutions\nat arbitrary PN orders. For instance, at 4PN we would have the freedom to introduce either arbitrary sextic terms,\n\n3\nWe recall that the origin of the effective-one-body approach lies in the quantum electrodynamics of two-charge systems, see\n[19].\n\n8\n\n\fq \u2032\u22122 [p\u20326 + p\u20324 (n\u2032 p\u2032 )2 + * * *], or a modification of the quartic terms: q \u2032\u22123 [p\u20324 + * * *]. This is more freedom than is needed\nto compensate for \u2206(4) = 4 \u2212 2 = +2, Eq. (3.9). We can also clearly arrange things so that circular orbits always\nfollow from a \"geodesic\" dynamics. The only somewhat unsatisfactory feature of the proposal (3.11) is that we cannot\noffer any principle for determining a priori the structure of the \"post geodesic\" terms. In particular, it would have\nbeen nice to say that (as is often the case in effective actions) the additional terms are somehow generated by the\nleading term, i.e. by the effective metric. We have in mind here relations of the type:\nA\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03bb1 R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b3\u03b4 + \u03bb2 \u2207\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b3\u03b4 + \u03bb3 \u2207\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 R + * * * ,\neff\nwhere R\u03b1\u03b2 is the Ricci tensor of g\u03b1\u03b2\n. However, we have checked that such \"geometrical\" tensors do not yield possible\n3PN corrections, but only much smaller contributions (starting at 5PN).\nWe shall give in the next section the details of the computation of the coefficients entering A(q \u2032 ), D(q \u2032 ), the\ngenerating function G3PN , the energy-mapping function and z3 . For the time being, let us only stress some conceptual\npoints. First, it is remarkable that the unique solution of the 3PN real \u21c4 effective matching problem leads to the\nsimple value\n\n\u03b13 = 0 ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nfor the 3PN parameter entering the energy-mapping (3.4). Ref. [13] had already found that \u03b12 = 0 at 2PN, and\n\u03b11 = \u03bd/2 at 1PN. These values correspond exactly to\nR\nEeff\n(E R )2 \u2212 m21 \u2212 m22\n= \u03c6 (sreal ) = real\n.\nm0\n2m1 m2\n\n(3.14)\n\nR 2\nWe find remarkable that the simplest, symmetric function of the Mandelstam invariant sreal = (Ereal\n) which reduces\nto E0 /m0 in the test-mass limit turns out to define the unique energy-map needed to link the real 3PN dynamics to\nthe effective dynamics. We interpret this as a good sign for our generalized dynamics (3.11). [By contrast, the other\nproposal of relaxing the natural constraint d1 = 0 leads to a very complicated energy-map with \u03b11 6= \u03bd/2, \u03b12 6= 0,\nand \u03b13 6= 0, see Appendix A.]\nLet us now consider the consequences of the effective-one-body approach for the determination of the LSO. For\nthe case of circular orbits the effective-one-body approach boils down to saying that the real energy is the following\nfunction of the effective-one,\ns\nER \u2212 \u03bc\nR\n(3.15)\n= M 1 + 2\u03bd eff\nEreal\n\u03bc\n\n(as obtained by inverting Eq. (3.14)) and that the effective energy along circular orbits is the square-root of the\nminimum value of a certain \"effective radial potential\":\nR\nEeff\n=\n\u03bc\n\nq\n[Wj (q \u2032 )]min ,\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere Wj (q \u2032 ) is obtained from (the square of) Eq. (3.12) by setting n\u2032 *p\u2032 = 0 (and p\u20322 = (n\u2032 \u00d7p\u2032 )2 +(n\u2032 *p\u2032 )2 = j 2 /q \u20322 )\n\u0013\n\u0012\nj4\nj2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(3.17)\nWj (q ) = A(q ) 1 + \u20322 + z1 \u20326 .\nq\nq\nAs said above, we shall assume (as is always possible) that z1 = 0, so that the effective potential has the usual\n\"Schwarzschild-like\" value \u2212g00 (q \u2032 ) (1 + j 2 /q \u20322 ). The value of the metric coefficient A(q \u2032 ) = \u2212g00 (q \u2032 ) is obtained, at\nthe 3PN level, as a perturbative expansion in 1/q \u2032 = GM/Reff :\n\u0012 \u0013\n2\u03bd\na4 (\u03bd)\n1\n2\n\u2032\n.\n(3.18)\nA(q ) = 1 \u2212 \u2032 + \u20323 + \u20324 + O\nq\nq\nq\nq \u20325\nNote that, finally, in this approach the entire effect of the 3PN dynamics (for circular orbits) is contained in the sole\ncoefficient a4 (\u03bd) (whose value will be discussed in the next section).\nIn Ref. [13] the metric coefficient A(q \u2032 ) was used (at the 2PN level) as a simple truncated Taylor expansion:\nA2PN (q \u2032 ) = 1 \u2212 2/q \u2032 + 2\u03bd/q \u20323 . This simple-minded approach is not adequate for dealing with the 3PN level. Indeed,\nwe shall see in next section that the coefficient a4 (\u03bd) is positive and can be relatively large. In keeping with the spirit\n9\n\n\fof the present work where we systematically try to use adequate resummation methods to improve the convergence\nof PN expansions, we shall define our effective-one-body radial potential, at the nPN accuracy (expressed in terms of\nthe convenient variable u \u2261 1/q \u2032 )\n\u0001\n(3.19)\nWjPn (u) = APn (u) 1 + j 2 u2\n\nby using a suitable Pad\u00e9 approximant of Eq. (3.18):\n\nAPn (u) \u2261 Plk [Tn+1 [A(u)]] ,\n\n(3.20)\n\nwith k + l = n + 1 (because it is q \u2032\u2212n\u22121 which corresponds to the nPN level) and, now the constraint k > 0 (instead\nof l > 0 as above), because we want to factor a zero of A(u) (and no longer a pole). The Pad\u00e9 improvement of A(u)\nis really needed (and makes a difference) only at the 3PN level. We have found that the most robust Pad\u00e9s (under\nvariation of the Taylor coefficients) are defined by taking k = 1 and l = n.\nSummarizing the present method: The effective radius q \u2032 of circular orbits is obtained as a function of the reduced\nangular momentum j by looking for the minimum of the radial potential (3.19), where u \u2261 1/q \u2032 and where the\nPad\u00e9-improved function A is given by Eq. (3.20), with k = 1 and l = n. For each value of j above some threshold\njmin , Wj (u) admits a (unique) minimum u\u2217 (j). From this one then determines the effective-energy (3.16), and then\nthe real one (3.15), namely\ns\n\u0014q\n\u0015\nR\nWj (u\u2217 (j)) \u2212 1 .\n(3.21)\nEreal (j) = M 1 + 2\u03bd\nThe real circular orbital frequency corresponding to j is then given by using the identity (2.21). This yields\np\nj u2\u2217 (j) APn (u\u2217 (j))\nr\nGM \u03c9real (j) =\ni.\nhp\np\n1 + j 2 u2\u2217 (j) 1 + 2\u03bd\nWj (u\u2217 (j)) \u2212 1\n\n(3.22)\n\nNote that in this approach j \u2261 jreal \u2261 jeffective . Finally, the LSO is invariantly defined as the minimum value of j,\njLSO = jmin , for which Wj (u) admits a local minimum. When j < jLSO , Wj (u) has no local minimum and there\nare no (stable or unstable) circular orbits (see, e.g., Fig. 1 of Ref. [13]). If one is only interested in locating the LSO\n(as a function of \u03bd) it suffices to look for the existence of an inflection point of Wj (u), i.e. to solve the simultaneous\nequations \u2202 Wj (u)/\u2202 u = 0 and \u2202 2 Wj (u)/\u2202 u2 = 0.\nIV. RESULTS\n\nLet us now give the details of the application, at the 3PN level, of the methods explained above. We follow the order\nof presentation given in the previous two sections. In what follows, we use the results of Ref. [16] for the dynamical\ninvariants of the 3PN two-body Hamiltonian. We recall that the 3PN Hamiltonian derived in Ref. [14] contained two\nambiguous parameters \u03c9static and \u03c9kinetic (these ambiguities arise because of the need to regularize badly divergent\nintegrals [14,20,16]), and that all the dynamical invariants involve only the combination \u03c3 (\u03bd) \u2261 \u03c9static \u03bd + \u03c9kinetic \u03bd 2\n[16].\nRecently the 'kinetic' ambiguity parameter \u03c9kinetic was uniquely determined [15] (see also [21]) to be \u03c9kinetic = 41/24,\n2\nso that \u03c3 (\u03bd) = \u03c9static \u03bd + 41\n24 \u03bd and the remaining 3PN ambiguity is embodied in the product \u03c9static \u03bd. As discussed\nin the Appendix A of [16] one expects (both by judging from the other coefficients, and by looking at some of the\nsources of ambiguity) that \u03c9static varies in the range\n\u2212 10 \u2264 \u03c9static \u2264 +10.\n\n(4.1)\n\nA. e-method\n\nFor self-containedness let us quote the results obtained in our previous paper [16] for the link between the energy and\nthe x-variable, Eq.

The results for equal-mass binaries\n(\u03bd = 1/4) are given in Table I.\nD. Effective one-body method\n\nLet us explain in detail how we implemented the effective one-body method. Two methods of implementation were\npresented in Ref. [13]. We could have used the first one by starting from the 3PN Delaunay Hamiltonian given in\nRef. [16]. However, we found finally as convenient (given the existence of good algebraic manipulators) to use the\nsecond method, which has the advantage of being more informative. This second method consists of writing explicitly\nthe equations that have to be satisfied by the looked for generating function G(q, p\u2032 ) and solving them. Indeed, we\nlook for a canonical transformation between the original (quasi-ADM) coordinates (q, p) of the real problem (i.e. the\nphase-space coordinates in which was obtained the order-reduced Hamiltonian H(q, p) in [16]), and the \"effective\"\ncoordinates (q \u2032 , p\u2032 ) (i.e. the coordinates used in Eq. (3.12)). The effect of the generating function G(q, p\u2032 ) reads\nq \u2032i = q i +\n\n\u2202 G(q, p\u2032 )\n,\n\u2202 p\u2032i\n\npi = p\u2032i +\n\n\u2202 G(q, p\u2032 )\n.\n\u2202 qi\n\n(4.24)\n\nNote that, as is well known, the canonical transformation is defined only in implicit form: q \u2032 and p being given as\nfunctions of q and p\u2032 . But there is, in fact, no need to solve for, e.g., (q \u2032 , p\u2032 ) as functions of (q, p). As the basic idea\nis anyway to identify the numerical value of, say, Heff (q \u2032 , p\u2032 ) with the numerical value of some (to be determined)\nfunction f (Hreal (q, p)), we can do this identification by expressing both sides in terms of any set of common variables,\nsay q and p\u2032 . Finally we write (using Eq. (3.4))\n14\n\n\fh\n\nb R q \u2032 (q, p\u2032 ), p\u2032\nH\neff\n\n\u0001i2\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\u00113 \u0015\u001b2\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u0001\nNR\nNR\nNR\n\u2032\nNR\nb\nb\nb\nb\n,\n1 + Hreal q, p(q, p ) 1 + \u03b11 Hreal + \u03b12 Hreal + \u03b13 Hreal\n\n(4.25)\n\nin which the L.H.S. is given by the R.H.S. of Eq. (3.12) (without the square root, because we work with the squared\nb NR (q, p) on the R.H.S. is the order-reduced Hamiltonian of [16], obtained from the higher-order\nequation), while H\nreal\n3PN Hamiltonian derived in [14]. Both sides of Eq. (4.25) are written in terms of q and p\u2032 by using Eq. (4.24). This\nprocedure has been used at the 2PN level in [13], so that we know the values of \u03b11 = 21 \u03bd, \u03b12 = 0, the 2PN values of the\nmetric functions A(q \u2032 ) and D(q \u2032 ), as well as the 2PN-accurate generating function G(q, p\u2032 ) (see e.g. Eqs. (6.24)\u2013(6.27)\nin [13]). The new unknowns entering at the 3PN level are: \u03b13 , a4 , Eq. (3.3a), d3 , Eq. (3.3b), z1 , z2 , z3 , Eq. (3.12),\nand the 7 arbitrary coefficients c1 , . . . , c7 entering the generic form of G3PN :\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n\u0001 c7\n1\n1\n(4.26)\nG3PN (q, p\u2032 ) = (q * p\u2032 ) c1 p\u20326 + c2 p\u20324 + c3 p\u20322 (n * p\u2032 )2 + c4 (n * p\u2032 )4 + 2 c5 p\u20322 + c6 (n * p\u2032 )2 + 3 .\nq\nq\nq\nThe basic input for writing these equations is the explicit value of the 3PN-accurate Hamiltonian [14,16,15]\nNR\nb real\nb N (q, p) + H\nb 1PN (q, p) + H\nb 2PN (q, p) + H\nb 3PN (q, p) ,\nH\n(q, p) = H\n\nwhere\n\n2\nb N (q, p) = p \u2212 1 ,\nH\n2\nq\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nb 1PN (q, p) = 1 (3\u03bd \u2212 1)(p2 )2 \u2212 1 (3 + \u03bd)p2 + \u03bd(n * p)2 1 + 1 ,\nH\n8\n2\nq 2q 2\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\nb 2PN (q, p) = 1 1 \u2212 5\u03bd + 5\u03bd 2 (p2 )3 + 1 5 \u2212 20\u03bd \u2212 3\u03bd 2 (p2 )2 \u2212 2\u03bd 2 (n * p)2 p2 \u2212 3\u03bd 2 (n * p)4 1\nH\n16\n8\nq\n+\n\n+\n\n\u0003 1\n1\n1\n1\u0002\n(5 + 8\u03bd)p2 + 3\u03bd(n * p)2 2 \u2212 (1 + 3\u03bd) 3 ,\n2\nq\n4\nq\n\n(4.27)\n\n(4.28a)\n(4.28b)\n\n(4.28c)\n\n\u0001\nb 3PN (q, p) = 1 \u22125 + 35\u03bd \u2212 70\u03bd 2 + 35\u03bd 3 (p2 )4\nH\n128\n\n\u00031\n\u0001\n1 \u0002\n\u22127 + 42\u03bd \u2212 53\u03bd 2 \u2212 5\u03bd 3 (p2 )3 + (2 \u2212 3\u03bd)\u03bd 2 (n * p)2 (p2 )2 + 3(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\u03bd 2 (n * p)4 p2 \u2212 5\u03bd 3 (n * p)6\n16\nq\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n\u221227 + 136\u03bd + 109\u03bd 2 (p2 )2 + (17 + 30\u03bd)\u03bd(n * p)2 p2 + (5 + 43\u03bd)\u03bd(n * p)4 2\n16\n16\n12\nq\n+\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\n\u2212\n\n25\n+\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n1 2 335\n\u03c0 \u2212\n64\n48\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n+\n+\n8\n\n\u03bd\u2212\n\u0012\n\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013\n23 2 2\n85\n1\n3\n7\n\u03bd p + \u2212 \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03bd \u03bd(n * p)2\n8\n16 64\n4\nq3\n\n\u0013 \u0015\n1\n109 21 2\n\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c9static \u03bd 4 .\n12\n32\nq\n\n(4.28d)\n\nAs explained in Refs.

This system can be\ndecomposed into three subsystems.

(4.29), yields 5 linear equations for the 5 unknowns c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 , and \u03b13 . It is easily\nfound to have a unique solution, namely\n\u03b13 = 0,\n\n(4.32a)\n\nc1 = \u2212\n\n1\n(1 + 3\u03bd + 5\u03bd 2 ) \u03bd,\n16\n\n(4.32b)\n\nc2 = \u2212\n\n1\n(1 + 2\u03bd \u2212 11\u03bd 2 ) \u03bd,\n16\n\n(4.32c)\n\nc3 = \u2212\n\n1\n(12 + 48\u03bd + 23\u03bd 2 ) \u03bd,\n24\n\n(4.32d)\n\nc4 =\n\n1\n(24 + 7\u03bd) \u03bd 2 .\n16\n\n(4.32e)\n\nAs already mentioned above, note the remarkably simple result \u03b13 = 0 (which confirms that the energy map takes\nthe nice form (3.14)). It is also remarkable that the result \u03b13 = 0 holds independently of any assumption about the\n\"quartic\" parameters z1 , z2 , and z3 .\nThe second subsystem (4.30) can be viewed (after inserting the unique solution of the first subsystem) as an\noverdetermined system for the two unknowns c5 , c6 . It is then easily seen that it will admit a solution if and only if\nthe parameters z1 , z2 , and z3 satisfy the following linear constraint:\n8z1 + 4z2 + 3z3 = 6(4 \u2212 3\u03bd)\u03bd.\n\n(4.33)\n\nThis linear constraint forbids us to consider the simplest \"geodesic\" case where z1 = z2 = z3 = 0. We can, however,\ncontinue to impose the natural conditions z1 = 0 = z2 which simplify very much the 3PN effective dynamics of circular\norbits. With this choice, the general constraint (4.33) yields\nz3 = 2(4 \u2212 3\u03bd)\u03bd.\nHaving fixed the values of z1 , z2 , and z3 , the system (4.30) uniquely determines c5 and c6 to be\n16\n\n(4.34)\n\n\fc5 = \u2212\n\n1\n(13 \u2212 16\u03bd + 6\u03bd 2 ) \u03bd,\n16\n\n(4.35a)\n\nc6 = \u2212\n\n1\n(115 + 116\u03bd \u2212 26\u03bd 2 ) \u03bd.\n48\n\n(4.35b)\n\nFinally, the subsystem (4.31) gives 3 equations for the remaining 3 unknowns c7 , d3 , and a4 . The unique solution\nof this system reads:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n1\n1 2 155\n\u03bd + \u03bd2 + \u03bd3,\n\u03c0 +\n(4.36a)\nc7 = \u2212\n64\n24\n8\n8\nd3 = 2(3\u03bd \u2212 26) \u03bd,\n\n(4.36b)\n\na4 =\n\n(4.36c)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n94 41 2\n\u2212 \u03c0 + 2\u03c9static \u03bd.\n3\n32\n\nNote how simple the structure of the coefficient a4 , Eq. (4.36c), is. Indeed, the right-hand-sides of all the equations\n(4.29), (4.30), (4.31), were polynomials of the third degree in \u03bd. Therefore, one would have a priori expected the 3PN\ncoefficient a4 to have the same structure: a4 = a41 \u03bd + a42 \u03bd 2 + a43 \u03bd 3 . It is remarkable that the coefficients of \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3\nhappen to vanish in a4 (such a simplification does not occur in the 3PN-level coefficients appearing in the functions\nE(x), e(x) and j 2 (x) considered above). This simple structure of a4 can be brought out by defining the following\nquantity,\n\u2217\n\u03c9static\n\u2261\u2212\n\n47 41 2\n+ \u03c0 = \u22129.3439 . . . ,\n3\n64\n\n(4.37)\n\nin terms of which the value of a4 can be written as\n\u2217\na4 = 2(\u03c9static \u2212 \u03c9static\n) \u03bd.\n\n(4.38)\n\nThe presence of already two cancellations in a4 (a42 = 0 = a43 ) suggests that the yet undetermined value of \u03c9static\n\u2217\nmight be precisely \u03c9static\n, so that a4 , Eq. (4.36c), simply vanishes. We shall see below that this conjecture is\nindirectly supported by the fact that a numerical value \u03c9static \u2243 \u22129 is selected by the requirement that the various\nmethods discussed in this paper agree in their predictions for LSO quantities. Note also the remarkable fact that if\n\u2217\n\u03c9static = \u03c9static\nall the \u03c0 2 terms cancell in all the 3PN-level coefficients, so that they all become rational (as were the\n2PN ones). [Stated in reverse, if one could a priori prove that all the 3PN coefficients are rational, this would support\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe conjecture that \u03c9static = \u03c9static\n, though it would be also compatible with having \u03c9static = \u03c9static\n+ a rational\nnumber.]\nThe coefficient a4 enters the PN expansion of A(u) \u2261 \u2212g00 (q \u2032 ) (with u \u2261 1/q \u2032 ):\nA(u) = 1 \u2212 2u + 2\u03bdu3 + a4 (\u03bd)u4 + O(u5 ).\n\n(4.39)\n\nAs mentioned above, we improve the behaviour of the PN expansion of A(u) by Padeeing it: APn (u) = Plk [Tn+1 [A(u)]]\nwith k + l = n + 1. We impose the constraint k > 0 to inject the information that A(u) should qualitatively look like\nASchw (u) = 1 \u2212 2u, i.e. have a zero at some u = 21 + O(\u03bd). As said above, the most robust (for our purpose) Pad\u00e9s of\nA(u) are the ones with k = 1 and l = n. Finally, we get the following sequence of Pad\u00e9-improved A:\nAP1 (u) \u2261 P11 [T2 [A(u)]] = 1 \u2212 2u ,\nAP2 (u) \u2261\n\nP21\n\nAP3 (u) \u2261\n\nP31\n\n(4.40a)\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 2 \u2212 12 \u03bd u\n[T3 [A(u)]] =\n,\n1 + 21 \u03bdu + \u03bdu2\n\n(4.40b)\n\n\u0001\n2(4 \u2212 \u03bd) + a4 (\u03bd) \u2212 16 + 8\u03bd u\n\u0001 .\n\u0001\n\u0001\n[T4 [A(u)]] =\n2(4 \u2212 \u03bd) + a4 (\u03bd) + 4\u03bd u + 2 a4 (\u03bd) + 4\u03bd u2 + 4 a4 (\u03bd) + \u03bd 2 u3\n\n(4.40c)\n\nTo extract the LSO quantities from these Pad\u00e9ed A's, we must consider the effective radial potential\nWjPn (u) = APn (u)(1 + j 2 u2 ) .\n17\n\n(4.41)\n\n\fThe value of j for which this radial potential has an inflection point defines jLSO (\u03bd); the corresponding value of u being\nuLSO = u\u2217 (jLSO ). As explained in Eqs. (3.21) and (3.22) above one then deduces the energy and the orbital frequency\nof the LSO. Note that the 2PN Pad\u00e9ed AP2 that we use here differs from the straightforward Taylor approximant AT2\nused in Ref. [13]. However, this difference is essentially negligible (as shown by comparing the lines \"eff. method\"\nand \"BD\" in Table I). The Pad\u00e9 improvement is, however, rather important at 3PN in the case where \u03c9static is\n\u2217\nsignificantly\u0001larger than \u03c9static\n. Indeed, in this case, Pad\u00e9eing allows one to tame the effect of a largish (positive)\n1\n1\na4 (\u03bd): a4 4 \u2243 4.67 + 2 \u03c9static . For instance, when \u03bd = 14 and \u03c9static & \u22121.2 the radial potential built from a straight\nTaylor-approximated AT4 (u) would not give rise to an inflection point continuously connected to the test-mass limit.\nWe attribute this lack of structural stability to the known bad properties of high-order PN expansions, and not to\nthe effective-one-body approach. The (numerical) results obtained by the effective one-body approach are exhibited\nin Table I.\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nBefore discussing the meaning of the results obtained above, let us state what we would a priori expect. First, we\nrecall that the study in Ref. [1] has shown that the sequence of Pad\u00e9 approximants of the invariant function F (v), giving\nthe gravitational wave flux in terms of v \u2261 (GM \u03c9/c3 )1/3 = x1/2 , had very good (and very monotonic) convergence\nproperties toward the exact result. [By contrast, the sequence of Taylor approximants was badly convergent, and\nSchw\nunstable when v . vLSO\n= 0.40825; see Figs. 3a and 3b of [1].] In our case, as one can meaningfully (at least for\nthe j- and effective-one-body methods) consider the 1PN, 2PN, and 3PN approximations, we would expect that a\ngood resummation technique would ensure that any LSO quantity, say QLSO , be determined with increasing accuracy,\nwhen using higher PN information, and, more precisely, that\nX\nn+1\nn\nQP\n,\nLSO \u2243 QLSO + a(b xLSO )\n\n(5.1)\n\nwith (hopefully) coefficients a and b small enough to ensure a visible convergence (when xLSO \u2243 xSchw\nLSO = 1/6). As a\nminimum test of improved convergence we hope that |Q3PN \u2212Q2PN | would be significantly smaller than |Q2PN \u2212Q1PN |,\ni.e. that the addition of the 3PN information would have only slightly refined the previous 2PN estimates of LSO\nquantities [1,13].\nIndependently of this expectation, we had also hoped, when starting this investigation, that the LSO quantities\nmight be \"robust\" under the lack of precise knowledge of a sole ambiguous coefficient (\u03c9static ) among many others\nin H3PN . [Given that the amplitude of this coefficient would have some plausible upper bound; as discussed in the\nAppendix A of [16].] However, the results exhibited in Table I and Fig. 1 show that, in spite of our use of resummation\ntechniques, the LSO quantities appear to be quite sensitive to the exact value of \u03c9static . A first conclusion of our\nwork is therefore that it is quite important to resolve the problem of static ambiguity, arising at 3PN when using\ndelta functions to represent compact (but extended) objects. Until this problem is unambiguously solved, it will not\nbe clear whether (as proposed in [1,13]) it is possible to trust suitably resummed versions of PN-expanded results.\nIn the meantime, however, we wish to point out several remarkable features of the dependence of our various results\non \u03c9static . In Fig. 2 we plot (for the equal-mass case, \u03bd = 1/4) our various predictions, at the 3PN level, and using\nvarious methods, as a function of the 3PN ambiguity parameter \u03c9static . It is quite interesting to note that two a priori\nindependent things happen:\n(i) there is a value of \u03c9static , namely\nbest\n\u03c9static\n\u2243 \u22129,\n\n(5.2)\n\nfor which the three different methods give, at 3PN, nearly coincident LSO predictions.\nbest\n(ii) For this \"best fit\" value \u03c9static\nthe 3PN LSO predictions exhibit the expected convergence property that\n|Q3PN \u2212 Q2PN | is significantly smaller than |Q2PN \u2212 Q1PN | (see Table II below).\nWe have checked that these two remarkable properties hold for all values of the parameter \u03bd \u2264 41 . Actually there\nare several other ways of selecting the approximate value (5.2), i.e. of understanding why it plays a special role. First,\nwe have seen above that the precise value (4.37) (which is near the \"best fit\" value (5.2)), played a special role in\nsimplifying not only a4 but also all the other 3PN coefficients. Second, it seems natural to expect that the true value\nof \u03c9static will be such that the full Taylor expansions of most of the invariant functions will be smooth deformations\nof their test-mass limits. A minimum requirement for this property of \"structural stability\" under the turning-on\nof the parameter \u03bd seems to be that the Taylor coefficients of the functions e(x), j 2 (x), K(y), and 1/A(u) do not\nchange sign as \u03bd varies from 0 to 1/4 (we only consider functions with infinitely many non-zero Taylor coefficients in\nthe test-mass limit). [One could actually impose a more restricted bound on the \u03bd\u2212variation of the 3PN coefficients,\n18\n\n\f-1\n\n1\n3.5\n0.975\n\n-1.2\n3\n\n-1.4\n\n-1.6\n\n0.925\n\n`\n\u03a9LSO\n\njLSO \u0090\u00c8jSchw\nLSO \u00c8\n\nELSO \u0090\u00c8ESchw\nLSO \u00c8\n\n0.95\n\n2.5\n\n0.9\n2\n0.875\n1.5\n0.85\n\n-1.8\n1\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u03a9static\n\n\u03a9static\n\n10\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\u03a9static\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2. Equal-mass (\u03bd = 14 ) binary systems LSO parameters obtained by means of different methods as functions of the\nambiguity parameter \u03c9static . The reduced binding energy ELSO , Eq.\nand the\u221areduced angular momentum jLSO , Eq.\n\u221a (2.2), Schw\nSchw\n(2.18), are divided by their \"Schwarzschild values\": ELSO\n= 1 \u2212 31 8 and jLSO\n= 12; the dimensionless orbital frequency\n\u03c9\nb LSO is defined in Eq. (4.9). The lines shown in the plots correspond to different methods: j-method (solid), effective one-body\n\u2217\nmethod (dotted), and e-method (dashed). The solid vertical lines correspond to \u03c9static = \u03c9static\n, Eq. (4.37).\n\nespecially given the information that the 2PN coefficients are found to vary by a smallish fractional amount.] We find\nthat this minimum requirement is satisfied only if \u03c9static < \u22120.62 (the consideration of the expansion of e(x) gives the\nmost stringent bound). Another natural requirement for \"structural stability\" under \u03bd 6= 0 would be to impose that\nall the near-diagonal Pad\u00e9s (without restricting oneself, as above, to the most \"robust\" ones) of the functions above\nexhibit real poles that are smoothly connected to their test-mass counterparts. This requirement is most stringent\nwhen considering P22 (1/A(u)), and yields the limit \u03c9static < \u22128.35. Combining this with the general limits Eq. (4.1)\nsuggests that \u03c9static lies within the small range \u221210 < \u03c9static < \u22128.35.\nLet us quote a last way of selecting the value (5.2). It consists in comparing the 3PN Taylor coefficients of the\ninvariant functions that contain only a finite number of terms in the test-mass limit. For instance, consider A(u) and\n1/j 2 (x). In the test-mass limit A(u) = 1 \u2212 2u and 1/j 2 (x) = x \u2212 3x2 . When \u03bd 6= 0 there will appear further powers of\nu or x with coefficients vanishing with \u03bd. At the 3PN level there is a term a4 u4 in A(u), and a term 38 b4 x4 in 1/j 2 (x).\n[The factor 8/3 is introduced to have the same (linear) dependence on \u03c9static in a4 and b4 .] These two coefficients\nread\n\u0013\n\u0012\n94 41 2\na4 (\u03bd) =\n\u2212 \u03c0 \u03bd + 2 \u03c9static \u03bd\n3\n32\n\u2248 18.6879 \u03bd + 2 \u03c9static \u03bd\n\n(5.3)\n\nand\nb4 (\u03bd) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n61 2\n1 3\n5269 41 2\n\u2212 \u03c0 \u03bd\u2212\n\u03bd +\n\u03bd + 2 \u03c9static \u03bd\n192\n32\n32\n216\n\n\u2248 14.7973 \u03bd \u2212 1.9063 \u03bd 2 + 0.00463 \u03bd 3 + 2 \u03c9static \u03bd.\n\n(5.4)\n\nLet us first note that the terms \u221d \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3 in Eq. (5.4) are numerically nearly negligible. Forgetting about them\n41 2\n(i.e. working with b\u20324 \u2261 ( 5269\n192 \u2212 32 \u03c0 ) \u03bd), we then see, by comparing Eqs. (5.3) and (5.4), that the coefficients a4 (\u03bd)\n\u2032\nand b4 (\u03bd) are approximately identical. In particular, this means that there will be a small range of values of \u03c9static for\nwhich a4 and b\u20324 will be simultaneously small. The existence of this range explains why the j- and effective one-body\nmethods can give numerically similar results. We can then make an analytical estimate of the 'best' value of the\n19\n\n\fTABLE II.

For definiteness, and for the purpose of the following discussion, we shall henceforth assume that\nthe \"correct\" value of \u03c9static is\n\u2217\n\u03c9static = \u03c9static\n.\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u2217\nIn Fig. 2 we have included vertical lines corresponding to \u03c9static = \u03c9static\n, to show visually that Eq. (5.6) is well\ncompatible with our argument based on the convergence of the various methods.\nOne can also see in Fig. 2 that the curves related to the e- and j-methods have a second intersection point, besides\nbest\nthe one around \u03c9static\n\u2243 \u22129. However, we have checked that the value of \u03c9static at this point strongly depends on the\nvalue of the parameter \u03bd. For this reason, and also for the fact that this point does not give an agreement with the\n\"effective\" method, we do not take this second intersection point as evidence for a different value of \u03c9static .\nAdmitting (for the sake of the following argument) Eq. (5.6) we wish to propose a further way of improving the\naccuracy of the predictions of LSO observables. Indeed, if one has at one's disposal three successive approximations,\nnamely the 1PN, 2PN, and 3PN estimates of some quantity QLSO , one can combine this information to refine the\nestimate of the (unknown) exact value QX\nLSO . The rationale for this is to assume that the approach to the limit, when\nthe order n of the approximant increases, is approximately described by Eq. (5.1) (i.e. essentially that the inaccuracy\nof the nth estimate decreases proportionally to the (n + 1)th power of some constant c \u2261 b xLSO < 1). Then, under\nthis assumption the knowledge of three (successive) approximants, say Qn\u22121 , Qn , and Qn+1 , gives three equations\n(Qm = QX + a cm+1 ) for the three unknowns (QX , a, c). One can solve this system of equations and deduce, in\nparticular, the value of the looked for n \u2192 \u221e limit QX in terms of Qn\u22121 , Qn , and Qn+1 . The result defines the\nso-called \"Shanks transformation\" [22], namely\n\nQX \u2243 Sn [Q] \u2261\n\nQn+1 Qn\u22121 \u2212 Q2n\n.\nQn+1 + Qn\u22121 \u2212 2 Qn\n\n(5.7)\n\nWhen one disposes of more than three Qm 's, the Shanks transformation associates to the original (truncated) sequence\n(Q1 , Q2 , . . . , QN ) a shorter, but hopefully faster converging sequence (S2 [Q], . . . , SN \u22121 [Q]). In our case, the Shanks\nLSO\nLSO\nprocedure associates to any triplet of LSO quantities (Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ) \u2261 (QLSO\n1PN , Q2PN , Q3PN ) a single number,\nQLSO\n\u2261\nS\n\nLSO\nLSO 2\nQLSO\n3PN Q1PN \u2212 (Q2PN )\n,\nLSO\nLSO\nQLSO\n3PN + Q1PN \u2212 2 Q2PN\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhich is a (hopefully better) estimate of the (unknown) exact value QX\nLSO . We shall refer to (5.8) as the S-estimate\nof QLSO .\nIn Table II (see also Fig. 3) we apply this procedure to our two best methods: the j-method and the effectiveone-body one, under the assumption (5.6) (which is needed to exhibit a visible convergence among the first three PN\napproximations).\nGiven our present (incomplete) knowledge we consider that the S-estimates exhibited in Table II represent our\nbest estimates of LSO observables. To verify the plausiblity of these estimates one should resolve the issue of the\nambiguous coefficient \u03c9static in the 3PN dynamics.

For j- and effective one-body methods we have plotted the\nresults at the 1PN level, 2PN level, and S-approximants; they are all exhibited in Table II. We have also shown the results\nobtained in Refs. [8] (labelled by KWW), and by applying the 2PN effective-one-body method to the \"Wilson-Mathews\"\ntruncation of general relativity (labelled by WM, see Appendix B).\n\nmethod described in [23] and used there at the 2PN level.] If this resolution approximately confirms the estimate\n(5.6) the S-estimates will be confirmed. If a very different value of \u03c9static is found, it might still be compatible with a\nless evidently convergent PN sequence. And hopefully, the S-estimate (5.8) of this new sequence will give an improved\n3PN-accurate estimate of LSO observables.\nUnder the assumption that the S-estimates are accurate, there are several interesting conclusions that we can\ndraw. First, we remark that the final estimates are quite near the 2PN-level predictions of the effective one-body\napproach, see Fig. 3. Although this may seem disappointing (an enormous, not yet completed, 3PN work leading to\na confirmation of 2PN estimates), this would be a scientifically very useful conclusion. Indeed, this would (in our\nminds at least) establish the soundness of the philosophy advocated in Refs. [1,13] and here, namely that resummation\nmethods can be meaningfully employed to make analytical predictions concerning physics near the Last Stable Orbit.\nThis would then also give support to the recent work of Buonanno and Damour [24] in which the 2PN effective\none-body Hamiltonian has been used, together with Pad\u00e9-resummed estimates of gravitational-radiation damping, to\nstudy the transition between the inspiral motion and the final plunge of a binary system. [Let us note, in passing,\nthat this work shows that, though it is crucial to have good initial estimates of the LSO quantities defined by the\nHamiltonian, the final observable effects linked to the presence of an LSO are blurred by radiation-reaction effects.]\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by the KBN Grant No. 2 P03B 094 17 (to P.J.) and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft\nGrant No. 02160-361-TG74 (to G.S.).

IV.\n\nAPPENDIX B: 2PN RESULTS FOR THE CONFORMALLY-FLAT TRUNCATION OF GENERAL\nRELATIVITY\n\nBy contrast, let us note that other approximation philosophies are, in our opinion, less reliable to make predictions\nconcerning the LSO. We have in mind here: (i) the use of non-resummed (or only partially resummed) PN expansions,\nand (ii) the \"Wilson-Mathews\"-type [25] truncation of Einstein's theory, in which the spatial metric is taken to be\nconformally flat. As an example of the first philosophy, let us consider the proposal of Kidder, Will, and Wiseman [10]\nto partially resum the Damour-Deruelle equations of motion by separating out (and resumming) the \"Schwarzschild\"\n(\u03bd = 0) terms. This approach led to the prediction (at 2PN) that the LSO is significantly less bound (when \u03bd = 1/4)\nthan the \"Schwarzschild\" limit. In terms of orbital frequency at the LSO, Ref. [10] predicts \u03c9\nbLSO (1/4) \u2243 0.891 < 1.\nThis contrasts very much with our 2PN and 3PN estimates above which consistently indicate that \u03c9\nbLSO (\u03bd) is larger\nSchw\nthan one (and that the LSO is more bound than its Schwarzschild limit: ELSO /|ELSO\n| < \u22121). Independently of\n23\n\n\fthis (biassed) argument, we think that both the robustness and the consistency of the \"hybrid\" approach of [10] are\nseriously in doubt. Indeed, Refs. [11] and [12] have shown that the hybrid approach was robust neither under a change\nof formulation (Hamiltonian versus equations-of-motion), nor under a change of coordinate system. Moreover, Ref.\n[1] has questioned the consistency of this approach by pointing out that the non-resummed \"\u03bd-corrections\" represent,\nin several cases, a very large (larger than 100%) modification of the corresponding \u03bd-independent terms.\nRegarding the conformally-flat truncation it was noted by Rieth [26] that this implies significant deviations from\nthe Einstein dynamics already at the 2PN level. We have investigated this question further. In Ref. [16] we gave the\ninvariant functions defined (at 2PN accuracy) by the Wilson-Mathews-type truncation.

Using\nthe procedure decribed in Sec. IV D above, imposing at the 1PN level the condition d1 = 0, we have found that the\neffective-metric function AWM (u) at the 2PN accuracy reads\nAWM (u) = 1 \u2212 2u + a3 (\u03bd)u3 + O(u4 ),\n\n(B4)\n\nwhere\na3 (\u03bd) =\n\n1\n(18 \u2212 5\u03bd)\u03bd.\n4\n\nWe have improved the behaviour of the 2PN expansion of AWM (u) by Padeeing it:\n\u0001\n5 2\n\u03bd u\n1 \u2212 2 \u2212 89 \u03bd + 16\n\u0001\n\u0001 .\nAWMP2 (u) \u2261 P21 [T3 [AWM (u)]] =\n5 2\n\u03bd u + 49 \u03bd \u2212 58 \u03bd 2 u2\n1 + 98 \u03bd \u2212 16\n\n(B5)\n\n(B6)\n\nTo extract the LSO quantities from this Pad\u00e9ed A, we have considered the inflection point of the effective radial\npotential AWMP2 (u)(1 + j 2 u2 ), which defines the angular momentum jLSO (\u03bd) and the location uLSO (\u03bd) of the LSO;\nthen using Eqs.
