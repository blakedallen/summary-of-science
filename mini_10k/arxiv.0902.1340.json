The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on\nFermi in 3 months produced a deeper and better-resolved map of the \u03b3-ray sky\nthan any previous space mission. We present here initial results for energies above\n100 MeV for the 205 most significant (statistical significance greater than \u223c10-\u03c3)\n\u03b3-ray sources in these data. These are the best-characterized and best-localized\npoint-like (i.e., spatially unresolved) \u03b3-ray sources in the early-mission data.\nSubject headings: Gamma rays: observations - surveys - catalogs; Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope; PACS: 95.85.Pw, 98.70.Rz\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCollections of information about what can be seen in the sky range from simple lists\nto complex catalogs. For high-energy \u03b3-rays (photon energies above 100 MeV), the first\neffort of this type was a COS-B source list (Hermsen et al. 1977), followed by the second\nCOS-B catalog (Swanenburg et al. 1981). The Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope\n(EGRET) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory yielded several catalogs, culminating\nin the third EGRET Catalog (3EG; Hartman et al. 1999) and an alternate catalog, EGR\n(Casandjian & Grenier 2008), but also including a catalog of just the sources seen above\n1 GeV (Lamb and Macomb, 1997). The AGILE telescope has recently released its first catalog (Pittori et al. 2009)1 . The rapidly-changing field of TeV \u03b3-ray astronomy has a number\nof on-line catalogs, e.g., TeVCat2 , a frequently-updated compilation of announced\n52\n\nUniversities Space Research Association (USRA), Columbia, MD 21044\n\n53\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Physics, Purdue University Calumet, Hammond, IN 46323-2094\n\n54\n\nMax-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik, D-69029 Heidelberg, Germany\n\n55\n\nInstituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain\n\n56\n\nConsorzio Interuniversitario per la Fisica Spaziale (CIFS), I-10133 Torino, Italy\n\n57\n\nDipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", I-00133 Roma, Italy\n\n58\n\nSchool of Pure and Applied Natural Sciences, University of Kalmar, SE-391 82 Kalmar, Sweden\n\n1\n\nSee http://www.asdc.asi.it/agilebrightcat/\n\n2\n\nhttp://tevcat.uchicago.edu/\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nTeV sources from ground-based observatories.\nThe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a successor to EGRET, with greatly improved sensitivity, angular resolution, and energy range.\nThis paper presents a list of bright LAT sources that have statistical significances of 10-\u03c3\nor higher, based on the first three months of survey data. Although the first official LAT\ncatalog is planned for release after the first year of operations, (after the LAT gammaray data themselves become publicly available)3 , this early list of bright sources\nwas released to enable multiwavelength studies by the broader community and\nto support proposal preparation for Cycle 2 of the Fermi Guest investigator\nprogram.\nThe reader is cautioned to avoid generalizing from this sample of sources. Some particular features are:\n\u2022 The source list is not a complete summary of sources seen by the LAT. Many additional\nsources are detected with lower confidence levels in the LAT data than are included\nhere (Sect. 3.3);\n\u2022 The source list is not flux limited and hence not uniform. Only sources above a\n10-\u03c3 statistical significance are included, as described below. Moreover, owing to\nthe strong energy dependence both of the angular resolution of the LAT and of the\nintensities of backgrounds, the limiting flux is dependent on spectral hardness. Because\n\u03b3-ray sources are seen against a background of diffuse gamma radiation, which is\nhighly non-uniform across the sky, e.g., (Hunter et al. 1997; Strong et al. 2004), the\nlimiting flux for a given statistical significance and spectral shape varies with position\n(Sect. 3.3).\n\u2022 The source list does not include detailed information about the energy spectra of\nindividual sources.\nBecause this list is a step toward the first LAT catalog, we adopt the terminology for\nsources that will be used in that catalog, with a 0 prefix. The source designation is 0FGL\nJHHMM.m+DDMM where the 0 refers to the preliminary nature of this list and FGL represents\nFermi Gamma-ray LAT (Sect. 5).\n3\n\nSee http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/proposals/.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n2.\n\nGamma-ray Detection with the Large Area Telescope\n\nThe LAT is a pair-production telescope (Atwood et al. 2009). The tracking section has\n36 layers of silicon microstrip detectors to record the tracks of charged particles, interleaved\nwith 16 layers of tungsten foil (12 thin layers, 0.03 radiation length, at the top or front of the\ninstrument, followed by 4 thick layers, 0.18 radiation length, in the back section) to promote\n\u03b3-ray pair conversion. Below the tracker lies an array of CsI crystals to determine the\n\u03b3-ray energy. The tracker is surrounded by segmented charged-particle anticoincidence\ndetectors (plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes) to reject cosmic-ray backgrounds.\nThe LAT's improved sensitivity compared to EGRET stems from a large peak effective area\n(\u223c8000 cm2 , or \u223c6 times greater than EGRET's), large field of view (\u223c2.4 sr, or nearly 5\ntimes greater than EGRET's), good background rejection, superior angular resolution (68%\ncontainment angle \u223c 0.6\u25e6 at 1 GeV for the front section and about a factor of 2 larger for the\nback section,vs. \u223c1.7\u25e6 at 1 GeV for EGRET; Thompson et al. 1993), and improved\nobserving efficiency (keeping the sky in the field of view with scanning observations, vs.\ninertial pointing for EGRET). Pre-launch predictions of the instrument performance\nare described in Atwood et al. (2009). Verification of the on-orbit response is in progress\n(Abdo et al. 2009q) but the indications are that it is close to expectations.\nThe data analyzed for this source list were obtained during 4 August 2008 - 30 October\n2008 (LAT runs 239503624 through 247081608, where the numbers refer to the Mission\nElapsed Time, or MET, in seconds since 00:00 UTC on 1 January 2001). During this\ntime F ermi was operated in sky scanning survey mode (viewing direction rocking 35\u25e6 north\nand south of the zenith on alternate orbits, except for a few hours of special calibration\nobservations during which the rocking angle was much larger than nominal for survey mode\nor the configuration of the LAT was different from normal for science operations. Time\nintervals when the rocking angle was larger than 47\u25e6 have been excluded from the analysis,\nbecause the bright limb of the Earth enters the field of view (see below). In addition, two\nshort time intervals associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB) that were detected in the\nLAT have been excluded. These intervals correspond to GRB 080916C (MET 243216749\u2013\n243217979, (Abdo et al. 2009a)) and GRB 081024B (MET 246576157\u2013246576187). The total\nlive time included is 7.53 Ms, corresponding to 82% efficiency after accounting for readout\ndead time and for observing time lost to passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly\n(\u223c13%).\nThe standard onboard filtering, event reconstruction, and classification were applied\nto the data (Atwood et al. 2009), and for this analysis the 'Diffuse' event class4 is used.\n4\n\nSee http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone Data/LAT DP.html.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThis is the class with the least residual contamination from charged-particle backgrounds.\nThe tradeoff for using this event class is primarily reduced effective area, especially below\n500 MeV. Test analyses were made with the looser 'Source' class cuts and these were found\nto be less sensitive overall than Diffuse class for source detection and characterization.\nThe alignment of the F ermi observatory viewing direction with the z axis of the LAT\nwas found to be stable during survey-mode observation (Abdo et al. 2009q). The instrument response functions \u2013 effective area, energy redistribution, and point-spread function\n(PSF) \u2013 used in the likelihood analyses described below were derived from GEANT4-based\nMonte Carlo simulations of the LAT using the event selections corresponding to the Diffuse\nevent class. The Monte Carlo simulations themselves were calibrated prior to launch using accelerator tests of flight-spare 'towers' of the LAT (Atwood et al. 2009). Consistency\nchecks with observations of bright sources in flight data are in progress (Abdo et al. 2009q).\nEarly indications are that the effective area below 100 MeV was overestimated by as much\nas 30% owing to pile-up effects in the detectors. The source detection and spectral\nfitting analyses described below use only data >200 MeV. The impact of the lowerthan-predicted effective area below 200 MeV is limited. The Diffuse event class\nalready had relatively little effective area below 200 MeV, and so the impact on\nsensitivity for source detection is small. Analyses of flight data suggest that the PSF is\nsomewhat broader than the calculated Diffuse class PSF at high energies; the primary effect\nfor the current analysis is to decrease the localization capability somewhat.\nFor the bright source analysis a cut on zenith angle was applied to the Diffuse class\nevents to limit the contamination from albedo \u03b3-rays from interactions of cosmic rays with\nthe upper atmosphere of the Earth. These interactions make the limb of the Earth (zenith\nangle \u223c113\u25e6 at the 565 km, nearly-circular orbit of Fermi) an intensely-bright \u03b3-ray source\n(Thompson et al. 1981). The limb is very far off axis in survey mode observations, but\nduring a small fraction of the time range included in this analysis the rocking angle reached\nangles as great as 47\u25e6 (see above) and so the limb was only \u223c66\u25e6 off axis. Removing events\nat zenith angles greater than 105\u25e6 affects the exposure calculation negligibly but reduces\nthe overall background rate. After these cuts, the data set contains 2.8 \u00d7 106 \u03b3-rays with\nenergies >100 MeV.\nFigures 1 and 2 summarize the data set used for this analysis. The intensity map\nof Figure 1 shows the dramatic increase at low Galactic latitudes of the brightness of the\n\u03b3-ray sky. Figure 2 shows the corresponding exposure map for the representative energy\n1 GeV. The average exposure is \u223c1 Ms and nonuniformities are relatively small (about 30%\ndifference between minimum and maximum), with the deficit around the south celestial\npole due to loss of exposure during passages of F ermi through the South Atlantic Anomaly\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(Atwood et al. 2009).\n\n3.\n\nConstruction of the Bright Source List\n\nAlthough Figure 1 shows some obvious bright sources, finding and measuring the properties of even the high-confidence sources involves more than visual inspection of the map.\nBecause this analysis involves the entire sky and the broad energy range of the\nLAT, it is necessarily more complex than the analysis of an individual source.\nThe source list was built on the basis of the full time interval. That is,\nwe did not attempt to detect potentially flaring sources on shorter time scales,\nalthough we did check for variability of the sources (Sect. 3.5) after the list\nwas constructed. Three steps were applied in sequence: detection, localization,\nsignificance estimate. At each step only a subset of the list at the previous step was kept. In\nthat scheme the bright source list threshold is defined at the last step, but the completeness is\ncontrolled by the first one. After the list was defined we determined the source characteristics\n(flux in two energy bands, time variability) and we searched for possible counterparts.\n\n3.1.\n\nDetection\n\nAt this time we do not have a good way to look for sources directly in the 3D space\nof position and energy so we used standard image detection techniques on counts images\nintegrated over energy, in which each event is simply stacked into the pixel corresponding to its best-guess incident direction. The algorithm we used (mr filter)\nis based on wavelet analysis in the Poisson regime (Starck & Pierre 1998). It looks for local deviations from the background model, leaving the background normalization free. We\nused the same background model defined in Sect. 3.3, but without any spectral\ncorrection. It returns a map of significant features (above some threshold) on which we\nrun a peak-finding algorithm, SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), to end up with a list of\nsources. We also used for comparison another wavelet algorithm, (PGWave, Damiani et al.\n1997; Ciprini et al. 2007), which differs in the detailed implementation and returns directly\na list of sources. Pre-launch simulations have shown that the latter was somewhat more\nsensitive on a flat background (i.e., at high Galactic latitudes) but did not work as well in\nthe Galactic plane. At the 10-\u03c3 level, the two detection methods yield identical source lists.\nAn important decision was which energy bands to use when applying the detection\nalgorithms. The most important instrumental characteristic in this respect is the point-\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Sky map of the LAT data for the time range analyzed in this paper, Aitoff projection\nin Galactic coordinates. The image shows gamma-ray intensity for energies >300 MeV, in\nunits of photons m\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 .\n\nFig. 2.- Exposure of the LAT for the time range analyzed in this paper, Aitoff projection\nin Galactic coordinates. The units are equivalent on-axis exposure in Ms.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nspread function. The 68% containment radius improves by a factor of 25, from \u223c 5\u25e6 at\n100 MeV to better than 1\u25e6 at 1 GeV, reaching \u223c 0.2\u25e6 above 10 GeV (Atwood et al. 2009).\nFor this reason there is (at least over 3 months) little confusion above 1 GeV and the diffuse\nbackground is not very limiting except in the Galactic ridge. On the other hand, most of the\nphotons (83%) are recorded below 1 GeV. The majority of the sources in the Galactic plane\nhave overlapping PSFs and are background dominated below 1 GeV (i.e., there are more\nbackground than source events inside the PSF). The starting energy therefore represents a\ntrade between statistics and resolution.\nAnother important aspect is that the events converted in the top, thin layers of the\ntracker (F ront events) have nearly a factor of two better PSF at a given energy than those\nconverted in the bottom thick layers (Back events). This corresponds to Back events\nof energy E having the same PSF width as F ront events of energy E/2. Therefore,\nto optimize the sensitivity of the source detection we used separate energy selections for\nF ront and Back events.\nThe final scheme combines three energy bands. The full detection band (1.8\u00d7106\nevents) starts at 200 MeV for F ront and 400 MeV for Back events. The remainder of the\n2.8\u00d7106 events above 100 MeV carry little position information and were not used for source\ndetection. We use a medium band starting at 1 GeV for F ront and 2 GeV for Back events\n(3.2 \u00d7 105 events), which provides better position estimates for hard spectrum sources. We\nhave also used a high energy band starting at 5 GeV for F ront and 10 GeV for Back events.\nThis band is very photon starved (3\u00d7104 events) but has essentially no background in a PSFsized region and can be useful for very hard sources and to avoid confusion in the Galactic\nplane. We use smaller image pixels at high energy (0.1\u25e6 ) than in the medium band (0.2\u25e6 )\nand the full energy band (0.3\u25e6 ) to adapt to the broader PSF at low energy. The bands are\nnot exclusive (i.e., the full band includes the high energy photons) because the high-energy\nevents always improve the detection. To obtain a global list of candidate sources we start\nwith the sources detected in the high-energy band (best localization) and add the sources\ndetected in the lower-energy bands in turn, excluding sources whose positions are consistent\nwith detections at higher energies.\nBecause the source detection methods are standard algorithms not specific\nto Fermi they work in cartesian coordinates, not the spherical sky. We map the whole sky\nwith 24 local World Coordinate System projections (Calabretta & Greisen 2002) in Galactic\ncoordinates: 4 CAR (plate carr\u00e9e) projections along the Galactic plane covering \u221210\u25e6 to\n+10\u25e6 , 6 AIT(Hammer-Aitoff) projections on each side of the plane covering 10\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 , and\n4 ARC (zenithal equidistant) projections (rotated 45\u25e6 so that the pole is in a corner) covering\n45\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 . Each map is 5\u25e6 larger on each side than the area from which the sources are\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nextracted, to avoid border effects.\nWe set the threshold of the source detection step at 4-\u03c3. This resulted in 562 'seed'\nsources. 290 were best detected in the full band, 212 in the medium band and 60 in the high\nband (among 151 total excesses above 4-\u03c3 in that band).\n\n3.2.\n\nLocalization\n\nThe image-based detection algorithms provide estimates of the source positions, but the\npositions are not optimal because the energy-dependent extent of the PSF is not fully\ntaken into account. These methods also do not supply error estimates on the positions.\nThe method that we use to localize the sources (pointfit) is a binned likelihood technique. It uses relatively narrow energy bins (typically 4 per decade) and sums log(likelihood)\nover the energy bins. It does not use events below 500 MeV, which carry little information\non position. To optimize the technique further the analysis gathers F ront and Back events\naccording to their PSF widths rather than their energies. Each source is treated independently. That means the model is a point source (with the same position but different width\nin each energy bin following the PSF) on top of a background model with free scaling in each\nenergy bin. The sources are treated in descending order such that brighter sources\nare included in the background model for fainter ones. The closest nearby source was\n0.5\u25e6 , with only a small effect on the fits to the lower energy bins. The program\nreturns the best-fit position and the error estimate (1-\u03c3 along one dimension) based on the\nassumption that \u22122\u2206log(likelihood) behaves as a \u03c72 -distribution. The LAT PSF itself is\nvery close to axisymmetric (Atwood et al. 2009). The error box is not in general\ncircular due to fluctuations in the positions of the few high energy photons that\ndominate the localization precision. Here we neglect this effect, which is small\nfor strong sources, and provide only error circles.\nOf the 562 initial sources, pointfit did not converge for 50 at this step, or converged to\nanother nearby source. The reason could be confusion, or a soft spectrum leading\nto too few source events above 500 MeV. We did not discard those outright, but kept\ntheir original positions. Several of them were deemed significant by the maximum likelihood\nalgorithm (Sect. 3.3). We defined the positions and position uncertainties of those using a\nmore precise but much slower tool (gtfindsrc) which accounts for all sources in the vicinity.\nMore precisely, we included in the local model all nearby sources (even those\nbelow the bright source limit defined in Sect. 3.3). The spectral parameters of\nthose within 1\u25e6 of the current source were left free, but only the current source's\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nposition was adjusted in a given run. The same tool was used in a number of confused\nregions (mostly close to the Galactic plane) in which the primary analysis did not converge\nwell. 32 sources in all were treated that way, including 13 of the bright sources presented\nhere. In the end 532 sources survived the localization step.\nThe angular uncertainties for localization are determined from the shape of the likelihood\nfunction as described above. This results in a 1-dimensional 1-\u03c3 error estimate \u2206xstat .\nFor a 2D axisymmetric gaussianpdistribution the 95% confidence level radius r95\nis related to \u2206xstat by a factor \u22122 log(1 \u2212 0.95) = 2.45. However examining the\ndistribution of the position errors from high-confidence, identified sources, we\nfound that we needed to increase the uncertainties by 40% in order to be sure\nof including 95% of the cases.\nFor very bright sources like Vela, the observed offsets from the true position observed\nwith the present analysis led us to add in quadrature an additional systematic uncertainty\nof 0.04 degrees to r95 .\n2\nr95\n= (1.4 \u00d7 2.45 \u00d7 \u2206xstat )2 + (0.04\u25e6 )2\n(1)\nBoth the 1.4 correction factor and the 0.04\u25e6 systematic uncertainty are conservative and are\nexpected to improve.\nFigure 3 illustrates the resulting position uncertainties as a function of the Test Statistic\n(T S) values obtained in Sect. 3.3. The relatively large dispersion that is seen at a given T S\nis in part due to the different local conditions (level of diffuse \u03b3-ray emission) but primarily\nto the source spectrum. Hard sources are better localized than soft ones for the same T S\nbecause the PSF is so much arrower at high energy. At our threshold of T S = 100 (10-\u03c3)\nthe typical 95% uncertainty radius is about 10\u2032 , and the maximum is 20\u2032.\n\n3.3.\n\nSignificance and Thresholding\n\nThe detection and localization steps provide estimates of significance, but these are\nunderestimates because the detection step does not explicitly use the energy information\nand the localization step does not use the low energy events. To better estimate the source\nsignificances we use a 3D maximum likelihood algorithm (gtlike) in unbinned mode i.e.,\neach event is considered individually according to its direction, energy, and conversion\nlocation in the LAT. This is part of the standard Science Tools software package5 currently\nat version 9r9. The gtlike tool provides for each source the best fit parameters and the Test\n5\n\nhttp://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Source location uncertainty radii (r95 from Eq. 1) as\n\u221a a function of Test Statistic\n(Sect. 3.3), down to a limit of T S = 25. The dotted line is a 1/ T S trend for reference. The\nvertical dashed line is our T S = 100 threshold. The horizontal dashed line is the absolute\nsystematic error that we adopted.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nStatistic T S = 2\u2206log(likelihood) between models with and without the source. That tool\ndoes not vary the source position, but it adjusts the source spectrum. It should be noted that\ngtlike does not include the energy dispersion in the T S calculation (i.e., it assumes that\nthe measured energy is the true energy). Given the 8% to 10% 1-\u03c3 energy resolution of\nthe LAT over the energy bands used in the present analyses, this approximation is justified.\nThe underlying optimization engine is Minuit6 . The code works well with up to \u223c30 free\nparameters, an important consideration for regions where sources are close enough together\nto partially overlap. Uncertainty estimates (and a full covariance matrix) are obtained from\nMinuit in the quadratic approximation around the best fit. For this stage we modeled the\nsources with simple power-law spectra.\nThe T S associated with each source is a measure of the source significance, or equivalently the probability that such an excess can be obtained from background fluctuations\nalone. The probability distribution in such a situation (source over background) is not precisely known (Protassov et al. 2002). However since we consider only positive fluctuations,\nand each fit involves two degrees of freedom (flux and spectral slope), the probability to\nget at least T S at a given position in the sky is close to 1/2 of the \u03c72 distribution with\ntwo degrees of freedom (Mattox et al. 1996), so that T S = 25 corresponds to 4.6 \u03c3 (one\nsided). Pre-launch simulations have shown that this approximation is indeed true if the\nbackground model is close to the truth.\nThe diffuse background is of course very important since it represents around 90% of the\nevents. We model the Galactic diffuse emission using GALPROP, described in Strong et al.\n(2004) and Strong (2007), which uses a realistic representation of cosmic-ray propagation in\nthe Galaxy and the resulting \u03b3-ray emission; it uses distributions of gas based on radioastronomical surveys, and the interstellar radiation field from an extensive modelling package. For\nthis work, the GALPROP package has been updated to include recent H I and CO surveys,\nmore accurate decomposition into Galactocentric rings, as well as a new calculation of\nthe interstellar radiation field for inverse Compton emission (Porter et al. 2008).\nFor this work the fit of the model to the Fermi data was improved by an increase\nin the inverse Compton component, and a flatter cosmic-ray gradient in the\nouter Galaxy. The particular GALPROP run designation for our model is 54\u2212 59varh7S.\nBecause the fitted fluxes and spectra of the sources can be very sensitive to even slight\nerrors in the spectral shape of the diffuse emission we allow the Galactic diffuse model\nto be corrected (i.e., multiplied) locally by a power law in energy with free normalization\nand spectral slope. The slope varies between 0 and 0.15 (making it harder) in the Galactic\n6\n\nhttp://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/cls/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/doc/doc.html\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nplane and the normalization by \u00b1 20%. The isotropic component of the diffuse emission\nrepresents the extragalactic and residual backgrounds (instrumental + Earth albedo).\nIt is modeled by a simple power law. Its spectral slope was fixed to E \u22122.25 , the best fit\nvalue at high latitude, and its normalization was left free. The three free parameters\nwere separately adjusted in each Region of Interest (see below).\nFor this significance analysis, we used only events with energies above 200 MeV, because\nthe fits to the diffuse spectrum were systematically high below 200 MeV; the extrapolation\nof the high-energy spectrum overestimated the data, possibly because of the acceptance\nbias described in Sect. 3.6. We feared that including the low-energy points could bias the\nwhole process. This energy cut changes little the T S estimates except for the very softest\nsources. The high energy limit for the analysis was set to 100 GeV. There were fewer\nthan 1000 events above 100 GeV, and at this point we do not have a single source\nthat is bright enough to check our calibration above that limit.\nWe split the sky into overlapping circular Regions of Interest (RoI), each typically 15\u25e6\nin radius. The source parameters are free in the central part of each RoI (which is chosen\nsuch that all free sources are well within the RoI even at low energy). We adjust the RoI\nsize so that not more than 8 sources are free at a time. Adding 3 parameters for the diffuse\nmodel, the total number of free parameters in each RoI is 19 at most. We needed 128 RoIs\nto cover the 532 seed positions.\nWe proceed iteratively. All RoIs are processed in parallel and a global current\nmodel is assembled after each step in which the best fit parameters for each\nsource are taken from the RoI whose center is closest to the source. At each\nstep the parameters of the sources close to the borders are fixed to their values in the\nglobal model at the end of the previous step; they all start at 0 flux at the first step\n(the starting point for the spectral slope is 2). Sources formally outside the RoI (but\nwhich can contribute at low energy due to the broad PSF) are included in the model as well.\nWe iterate over 5 steps (the fits change very little after the fourth). At each step we remove\nsources with low T S and refit, raising the threshold up to 25 (approximately 5-\u03c3) at the\nlast step. We have checked via simulations that removing the faint sources has\nlittle impact on the bright sources, much less so than changing the diffuse model\ndoes (Sect. 3.6).\nThis procedure left 444 sources, among which 205 have T S > 100. We chose not to\ninclude the lower-significance sources (T S < 100) in the bright source list for two reasons:\n\u2022 The number of sources per Test Statistic interval normally decreases with increasing\nT S for any logN-logS close to Euclidean. This is not the case with our procedure (there\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nare fewer sources at 25 < T S < 30 than at 35 < T S < 40) particularly in the Galactic\nplane. This is a rather sure sign that we are missing sources at low flux, and more so\nin the Galactic plane. Given the relatively rough nature of the detection procedure\n(Sect. 3.1) this is not particularly surprising.\n\u2022 Judging by the spatial and spectral residuals the Galactic diffuse model is still in need\nof improvement (see Sect. 3.6). This uncertainty makes us wary of claiming detections\nof sources not too far above the diffuse level.\nOn the other hand the sources at T S > 100 can be seen by eye on the images and we\nare confident they are all real. Note that all excesses formally above T S = 25 were included\nin the maximum likelihood adjustments (including those described in Sect. 3.4 and 3.5) to\navoid transferring their fluxes to the more-significant sources.\nFigure 4 shows the source flux needed to reach a 10-\u03c3 significance level at any point in\nthe sky for the 3-month time interval considered in this analysis. This is based on a calculation using the Galactic diffuse and isotropic background models, the instrument response\nfunctions of the LAT, and the pointing history during the 3 months, and assuming an E \u22122.2\nspectrum, the average spectral shape of the sources. This should be viewed as an indication only because the detection threshold depends on the source spectrum. Although the\nnonuniform exposure affects this map somewhat, the dominant factor is the strong diffuse\nemission along the Galactic plane.\n\n3.4.\n\nFlux Determination\n\nThe maximum likelihood method described in Sect. 3.3 provides good estimates of the\nsource significances, but not very accurate estimates of the fluxes. This is because the\nspectra of most sources do not follow a single power law over that broad an energy range\n(more than two decades). Among the two most populous classes, the AGN often show a\nbroken power-law spectrum and the pulsars an exponentially cut off power law. In both\ncases fitting a single power law over the entire range overshoots at low energy where most of\nthe photons are, and therefore biases the fluxes high (on the other hand the effect on the\nsignificance is low due to the broad PSF and high background at low energies).\nAn additional difficulty is that the fit over the entire range stopped at 200 MeV, whereas\ncomparison with previous missions requires that we provide fluxes starting at 100 MeV.\nExtrapolating back to 100 MeV would have added another error.\nTo provide better estimates of the source fluxes, we have decided to split the range in\ntwo and define two independent bands from 100 MeV to 1 GeV and 1 GeV to 100 GeV. The\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n1 GeV limit is largely arbitrary but is a round number that happens to split the\ndata into approximately equal contributions to the sources' significance. The list\nof sources remains the same in the two bands of course. Each band is treated in the same\nway as the full band in Sect. 3.3. The power-law slopes are fitted independently in each\nband for each source. We discard the slopes here because they are not very precise (the low\nband is not very broad and there are not many events in the high band) and keep only the\nflux estimates. Even though the fit is not good near 100 MeV as mentioned in Sect. 3.3 (see\nalso Sect. 3.6), including the data down to 100 MeV still provides a more reliable estimate\nof the flux than extrapolation for all sources which do not follow exactly a power law. The\nestimate from the sum of the two bands is on average within 30% of the flux obtained in\nthe previous section, with excursions up to a factor 2. We have also compared those\nestimates with a more precise spectral model for the three bright pulsars (Vela,\nGeminga and the Crab). The flux estimates are within 5% of each other.\nAn additional difficulty that does not exist when considering the full data is that, because\nwe wish to provide the fluxes in both bands for all sources, we must handle the case of sources\nthat are not significant in one of the bands or where the flux is poorly determined due to\nlarge uncertainty in the spectrum. This situation occurs even for the high-confidence sources\nreported here: 9 have T S < 25 for the 100 MeV - 1 GeV band, and 2 have T S < 10 in\nthis band. No high-confidence source has T S < 25 in the 1-100 GeV band. This difference\nreflects the fact that the current study (and the LAT in general) is more sensitive at high\nenergy. For the sources with T S < 10 or poorly-measured flux values (where the nominal\nuncertainty is comparable to the flux itself), we replace the flux value from the likelihood\nanalysis by a 2-\u03c3 upper limit (2\u2206log(likelihood) = 4), indicating the upper limit by a 0 in\nthe flux uncertainty column of Table 6.\n\n3.5.\n\nVariability\n\nFor this paper we wanted to flag sources that are clearly variable. To that end we use\nthe same energy range as in Sect. 3.3 (200 MeV to 100 GeV) to study variability. To avoid\nending up with too large error bars in relatively short time intervals, we froze the spectral\nindex of each source to the best fit over the full interval. Sources do vary in spectral shape\nas well as in flux, of course, but we do not aim at characterizing source variability here, just\ndetecting it. It is very unlikely that a true variability in shape will be such that it will not\nshow up in flux at all.\nWe split the full three-month interval into Nint = 12 intervals of a little more than\none week. This preserves some statistical precision for the moderately bright sources we are\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\ndealing with here, while being sensitive in the right time scale for flaring blazars. Because we\ndo not expect the diffuse emission to vary, we freeze the spectral adjustment of the Galactic\ndiffuse component to the local (in the same RoI) best fit over the full interval. We need\nto leave the normalization of at least one diffuse component free (just to adapt to\nthe natural Poisson variations of the background). Because it was not obvious which one to\nfreeze we decided to leave both (Galactic and isotropic) free in each interval. So in the end\nthe fitting procedure is the same as in Sect. 3.3 except that all spectral shape parameters\nare frozen. The faint sources were left free (even when not significant in the current\ninterval) as well as the bright ones.\nAs in Sect. 3.4 it often happens that a source is not significant in all intervals. To\npreserve the variability index (Eq. 2) we keep the best fit value and its estimated error even\nwhen the source is not significant. This does not work, however, when the best fit is very\nclose to zero because in that case the log(likelihood) as a function of flux is very\nasymmetric. Whenever T S < 1 we compute the 1-\u03c3 upper limit and replace the error\nestimate with the difference between that upper limit and the best fit. This is an\nestimate of the error on the positive side only. The best fit itself is retained.\nFigures 5 and 6 show the fluxes derived for the Vela and Geminga pulsars as a function\nof time. As the brightest persistent sources, Vela and Geminga provide a reference for nonvariability. Based on these light curves, we estimate that the instrument and processing\n(event classification) are stable on time scales of weeks to 2% relative precision. To be\nconservative we have added in quadrature a fraction frel = 3% of the average flux Fav to the\nerror estimates (for each 1-week time interval) used to compute the variability index.\nFigure 7 shows the flux derived for the AO 0235+164 blazar as a function of time.\nIn contrast to the steady pulsars, many of the blazars detected by the LAT show strong\nvariability.\nThe variability index is defined as a simple \u03c72 criterion:\nV =\n\nX (Fi \u2212 Fav )2\n\u03c3i2 + (frel Fav )2\ni\n\n(2)\n\nwhere i runs over the 12 intervals and \u03c3i is the statistical uncertainty in Fi . Since Fav\nis not known a priori, this parameter is expected, in the absence of variability, to follow\na \u03c72 distribution with 11 (= Nint \u2212 1) degrees of freedom. We set the variability flag True\nwhenever the probability of getting the value of V or more by chance is less than 1% (so that\nwe expect 2 false positives over the sample of 205 sources). This corresponds to V > 24.7.\nThis variability index is robust for the bright sources considered here, although for lesssignificant sources methods that handle upper limits will be needed.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nFigure 8 shows the relative variability of the sources. It is defined from the excess\nvariance on top of the statistical and systematic fluctuations:\nsP\nP 2\n2\ni \u03c3i\ni (Fi \u2212 Fav )\n2\n(3)\n\u03b4F/F =\n\u2212\n\u2212 frel\n2\n2\n(Nint \u2212 1)Fav\nNint Fav\nThe typical relative variability is 50%, with only a few strongly variable sources beyond\n\u03b4F/F = 1. The dotted lines show how the relative variability depends on the variability\nindex as a function of T S, assuming that the relative precision on flux is the same for all\nsources (we get a relative precision of 0.16 for the flux on average at T S=100). So\nthis means that the criterion we use is not sensitive to relative variations smaller than\n60% at T S = 100. That limit goes down to 20% as T S increases to 1000. Note\nthat because the relative precision on flux is not exactly the same for all sources the cutoff,\nexpressed in relative variability, is not sharp. It is clear that we must be missing many\nvariable AGN below T S = 1000.\n66 bright sources (one third of the sample) are declared variable. This is far more than\nthe 2 false positives expected, so most of them are truly variable. This level of variability\nis not particularly surprising, as blazars are known to be strongly variable on timescales of\ndays to weeks. We emphasize that sources not flagged may also show variability at lower\namplitude or different time scales than used for this test. We refer to these other sources as\n\"non-variable\" (on weekly time scales) rather than \"steady.\"\n\n3.6.\n\nLimitations and Systematic Uncertainties\n\nA limitation of this work is that we did not attempt to test for source extension. All\nsources are assumed to be point-like. This is true for all known source populations in the GeV\nrange (see Sect. 4). On the other hand the TeV instruments have detected many extended\nsources in the Galactic plane, mostly pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants, (e.g.,\nFunk 2005; Abdo et al. 2007). The current level of LAT exposure cannot address source\nextension at the level seen by the TeV telescopes.\nWe have addressed the issue of systematics for localization in Sect. 3.2. This section\ndeals with the systematic uncertainties on flux estimates. An obvious one is the powerlaw representation within each energy band. If one source had a very curved\nspectrum (like a spectral line) its flux estimate certainly would be inaccurate.\nOur experience with those sources for which more detailed studies have been\nmade, though, is that the current estimates are fully acceptable. Beyond that,\nthere are two main sources of systematics: the imperfect knowledge of the instrument so\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nearly into the mission, and the imperfect modeling of the diffuse emission.\nThe fluxes are calculated using pre-launch calibrations (designated P6 V1) based on\nMonte Carlo simulations and a beam test at CERN (Atwood et al. 2009). In flight, the\npresence of pile-up signals in the LAT tracker and calorimeter left by earlier particles was\nrevealed in periodic trigger events. This effect leads to a reduction of the actual acceptance as\ncompared to the pre-launch prediction, as fewer events pass the rejection cuts, most notably\nfor photons below 300 MeV. The magnitude of this reduction is still under investigation,\nbut the fluxes reported here may be lower than the true ones by as much as 35% below\n1 GeV and 15% above 1 GeV. Because of the current uncertainty, no correction has been\napplied to the results; these effects are being assessed in detail, and will then be included in\na reprocessing of the data. This uncertainty applies uniformly to all sources. Our relative\nerrors (comparing one source to another or the same source as a function of time) are much\nsmaller, as indicated in Sect. 3.5.\nIt is interesting to note that the flux above 100 MeV that the LAT finds for the three\nhistorical pulsars (Vela, Geminga and the Crab) is actually very close to that reported in\nthe 3EG catalog (Hartman et al. 1999). Geminga and the Crab are within 1 \u03c3, and the LAT\nflux for Vela (9.15 \u00d710\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) is 11% higher than that of EGRET. This implies\nthat the bias may be on the low side of our estimate, unless EGRET also underestimated\nthe source flux.\nThe diffuse emission is the other important source of uncertainties. Contrary to the\nformer, it does not affect all sources equally. It is essentially negligible (i.e., smaller than\nthe statistical errors) outside the Galactic plane (|b| > 10\u25e6 ) where the diffuse emission is\nfaint and varying on large angular scales. It is also not much of a worry in the high band\n(> 1 GeV) where the PSF is sharp enough that the bright sources dominate the background\nunder the PSF. But it is a serious issue inside the Galactic plane (|b| < 10\u25e6 ) in the low band\n(< 1 GeV) and particularly inside the Galactic ridge (|l| < 60\u25e6 ) where the diffuse emission\nis strongest and very structured, following the molecular cloud distribution. It is not easy to\nassess precisely how large the uncertainty is, for lack of a proper reference. We have tried reextracting the source fluxes assuming a very different diffuse model, and the results tend to\nshow that the systematic uncertainty more or less follows the statistical one (i.e., it is larger\nfor fainter sources) and is of the same order. We have not increased the errors accordingly,\nthough, because this alternative model does not fit the data as well as the reference model\nwhere the differences in the source fluxes are largest.\nThe net result of these considerations is that we expect our high energy fluxes to be\nreasonably accurate, but the low energy fluxes are not as reliable and should be treated with\nparticular caution in the Galactic ridge.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n4.\n\nSource Association and Identification\n\nEven with the superior angular resolution of LAT compared to previous-generation \u03b3ray telescopes, the source location accuracy is not good enough to draw firm conclusions\nbased on positional coincidence in most cases. A typical LAT error circle contains multiple\nstars, galaxies, X-ray sources, infrared sources, and radio sources. Determination of the\nnature of a given LAT source must therefore rely on more information than only simple\nlocation. Two principles lead the search for counterparts:\n\u2022 Variability is a powerful diagnostic, particularly considering that many \u03b3-ray sources\nare known to be variable. Searches for periodic variability (such as rotational and\norbital motion) offer opportunities for unique identifications. Determining variability\ncorrelated with that seen at other wavelengths is another approach.\n\u2022 LAT \u03b3-ray sources are necessarily nonthermal objects involving large energy transfers.\nPhysical properties of any candidate counterpart must be consistent with generation\nof a significant luminosity of gamma radiation.\nIn this analysis, the LAT team makes a clear distinction between a source identification\nand an association with an object at another wavelength. A firm identification of a source is\nbased on a timing characteristic such as a periodicity for a pulsar or binary or a variability\ncorrelated with observations at another wavelength in the case of a blazar. An association\nis made for a statistically-improbable positional coincidence of a plausible \u03b3-ray-producing\nobject with a LAT source.\n\n4.1.\n\nAutomated Source Associations\n\nIn anticipating the large number of \u03b3-ray sources that will be detected by the LAT in\nthe course of the mission, we implemented an automated source association pipeline that\nattempts to make quantified associations between LAT sources and potential counterparts.\nIn its implementation for the Bright Gamma-Ray Source List the pipeline is almost exclusively based on positional coincidence, yet is driven by past knowledge about GeV source\nclasses (pulsars and blazars) and physical expectations (such as total luminosity and\nnonthermal emission implying particle acceleration). Future implementations will\nalso include figure-of-merit (FoM) approaches (Sowards-Emmerd et al. 2003) but these first\nrequire careful training on firmly identified source classes.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nFor each LAT source the probability of association with a source in the counterpart catalog is estimated using a Bayesian approach (e.g., de Ruiter et al. 1977; Sutherland & Saunders\n1992) that considers the spatial match between LAT source and counterpart in light of the\nposition uncertainty r95 and the chance coincidence probability as inferred from the local\nsource density in the counterpart catalog. Specifically we calculate the posterior probability\nof association\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2\n1 \u2212 Pprior \u03c0\u03c1 r95\n\u2206\nPpost = 1 +\n(4)\ne\nPprior 2.996\n2\nwhere \u03c1 is the local counterpart density, \u2206 = 2.996 \u00d7 r 2 /r95\n, r is the angular separation between LAT source and catalog counterpart, and Pprior is the prior probability of association that we use here as a constant tuning parameter whose value\nis adjusted for each counterpart catalog to give an approximately constant false\nassociation rate among the catalogs considered. Since the value of Ppost depends\non the choice of Pprior we arbitrary define a counterpart as a possible association\nif Ppost \u2265 0.5. We applied our pipeline to random realizations of plausible LAT\ncatalogs 7 in order to find for each counterpart catalog the value of Pprior that\ndoes not produce more than a single spurious association.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the catalogs that have been used in our automatic association\nprocedure. We also quote the prior probabilities that have been employed and give the total\nnumber of objects in each catalog. Note that we make an exception to our procedure when we\ncross-correlate the EGRET 3EG and EGR and AGILE AGL catalogs with the LAT sources.\nSince in these cases the uncertainties in the localization of the counterparts is worse than\nfor the LAT sources we consider all EGRET and AGILE sources as possible counterparts if\nthe LAT and counterpart separation is less than the quadratic sum of their 95% confidence\nerror radii.\nThe pulsar catalog (the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, Manchester et al. 2005) is special in\nthat we split it into high and low \u0116/d2 sub-samples, where \u0116 is the rate of energy loss of\nthe pulsar and d is the distance. High \u0116/d2 has been proposed as a good estimator of a\npulsar's \u03b3-ray visibility (Smith et al. 2008), and downselecting the catalog to the 100 best\ncandidates allows for a relatively large prior probability without inflating the number of false\npositives. For the remaining pulsars our Monte Carlo simulations required a much\nsmaller prior probability (to keep the chance coincidences low) at the expense of reducing\n7\n\nThe plausible LAT catalogs contained 1000 sources of which 75% were distributed isotropically over the\nsky and 25% were distributed along the Galactic plane following a 2D Gaussian shaped density profile with\n\u03c3 = 40 deg in longitude and \u03c3 = 2 deg in latitude. For each source an error radius r95 of 0.2 deg has been\nassumed.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nTable 1: Catalogs used for automatic source association.

This procedure can be considered as a simple binary\nfigure-of-merit approach which favours revealing high \u0116/d2 counterparts of LAT sources.\nThe performance of our association scheme is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows the\ndistribution of normalized angular separations between LAT sources and counterparts; the\nnormalization is done with respect to the measured localization uncertainty (Sect. 3.2). We\nalso show the expected distribution for the case that all sources have been correctly associated\n(dotted line) or are spurious associations (dashed line). Obviously, the observed distribution\nclearly follows the first trend, suggesting that most of our associations are indeed reasonable\nand that our efforts to reduce the number of false positives were successful. We notice that\nthe histogram shows a slight trend to smaller angular separations than expected, which might\nresult from a slight overestimation of our source localization uncertainties.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nAlternate Associations, Firm Identifications, and Special Cases\n4.2.1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)\n\nActive Galactic Nuclei have been recognized since the EGRET era as a well-defined\nclass of gamma-ray sources. For this reason, we have adopted an alternate method of finding\nAGN associations beyond the automated association procedure described in the previous\nsection. This method uses a Figure of Merit (FoM) approach similar to the one described\nby Healey et al. (2008), based not only on positional proximity but also on radio spectral\nindex, X-ray flux, and radio flux (Abdo et al. 2009c). Details of this association procedure,\nincluding the calculated probabilities from both the FoM and automated association\napproaches, can be found in that paper. Although most of the associations are\nfound by both methods, about 11% are found only by one of the two. In order\nto maintain consistency with the LAT AGN paper (Abdo et al. 2009c), we show\nany association found by either method.\nIt should be emphasized, however, that Abdo et al. (2009c) chose to apply the AGN\nanalysis only to parts of the sky with Galactic latitudes more than 10\u25e6 from the plane in\norder to have a more uniform sample, while the present analysis covers the entire sky. AGN\nare seen by LAT at lower Galactic latitudes, because the Galaxy is largely transparent to \u03b3rays. Due to Galactic extinction and source confusion, AGN identification is more difficult at\nlow latitudes. Some of the unassociated LAT sources in this part of the sky can be expected\nto have AGN counterparts in further analysis, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n4.2.2. Firm identifications\nFor this early source list from the LAT, we have taken the conservative view that\nassociation, even with high probability, is not equivalent to firm identification. Error circles\nare still large compared to source localization at longer wavelengths. We adopt the approach\nthat firm identification for the 0FGL sources is limited to those for which variability can\nunambiguously establish the source.\nFirm identifications of pulsars are based on seeing the pulsations in the \u03b3-ray data with\nhigh confidence. Using several statistical tests, we require that the \u03b3-ray distribution in\npulsar phase be inconsistent with random at a probability level of 10\u22126 or smaller. Examples are the 6 pulsars confirmed from the EGRET era, the radio-quiet pulsar found in\nthe CTA 1 supernova remnant (Abdo et al. 2008), PSR J0030+0451 (Abdo et al. 2009o),\nPSR J1028\u22125819 (Abdo et al. 2009f) and PSR J2021+3651 (Abdo et al. 2009n). In total\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nthe 0FGL source list includes 30 firm pulsar identifications. One third of the sources within\n10\u25e6 of the Galactic Plane have now been identified with pulsars.\nThe HMXB system LSI +61 303 is firmly identified based on the observation of the\norbital period of the binary system (Abdo et al. 2009j). A search for periodicity in the\nsimilar source LS5039 is still in progress.\nFirm identifications of AGN depend on finding correlated multiwavelength activity. This\nwork is ongoing.\n\n4.2.3. Special cases \u2013 Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) and Supernova Remnants (SNRs)\nSNRs and PWNe that are positionally correlated with LAT sources are not listed as\nindividual associations in the main source list table. Statistical indications are that SNRs\nthat were coincident with EGRET sources are significantly correlated with the 0FGL sources.\nHowever, the large number of pulsars detected by the LAT, including radio-quiet pulsars\n(e.g., Abdo et al. 2008), suggests that even a positional coincidence with an SNR of an age,\ndistance, and environment plausible for a \u03b3-ray source may be due to a \u03b3-ray pulsar. Of the\n0FGL sources positionally associated with PWNe or SNRs, approximately 40% have already\nbeen found to contain \u03b3-ray pulsars. At the present level of sensitivity for the LAT-detected\npulsars, only the Crab has shown evidence for off-pulse emission that can be attributed\nto a PWN or SNR. Until the possibility of pulsed emission for such sources can be ruled\nout, we are reluctant to make any claims about individual PWNe or SNRs as possible LAT\ndetections. Effectively, the high rate of pulsar detections increases the burden of proof for\nPWN and SNR candidates, for example via studies of source extents.\nTable 2 shows the 0FGL sources that are associated positionally with PWNe and SNRs,\nplus 4 pulsars that do not (yet) show evidence of \u03b3-ray pulsation. Torres et al. (2003)\nconsidered several of the SNRs in Table 2 in terms of their potential to be \u03b3-ray counterparts\nto unidentified low-latitude EGRET sources. In the case of SNR G284.3\u22121.8 they argued\nthat PSR J1013\u22125915 was more probably the \u03b3-ray source.\n\n5.\n\nThe Source List\n\nThe bright source list is presented as a single table (Table 6). Table 3 is a description of\nthe columns in Table 6. Within the table, sources that have firm identifications or tentative\nassociations are listed by class. Table 4 describes those classes.

This list is available as a FITS file from the Fermi Science Support\nCenter.\n\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs is clear from the references in this paper, much of the work on the early data from\nF ermi LAT is still in progress. In particular, we re-emphasize several caveats for use of this\nbright source list:\n\u2022 Ongoing efforts to understand the calibration and improve the analysis techniques\nare underway. In many respects, therefore, the 0FGL source list is quite preliminary.\nSignificant improvements are expected before the construction of the first full LAT\ncatalog.\n\u2022 The GALPROP diffuse model used in the analysis is still evolving. Matching the model\nto the large-scale emission is an iterative process. The diffuse model is particularly\nimportant for sources near the Galactic Plane.\n\u2022 This source list is limited to high-confidence detections. It is not a full catalog.\n\u2022 The 0FGL list information in two broad energy bands is not appropriate for detailed\nspectral modeling.\n\u2022 This work is a \"snapshot\" of the LAT results covering only the observation time\nperiod August to October, 2008.\n\u2022 The use of the diffuse class of events means that LAT has little sensitivity below\n200 MeV for this particular analysis. As noted by Abdo et al. (2009c) in their analysis\nof AGN, the LAT is more sensitive to hard-spectrum sources than previous satellite\ninstruments.\nDespite these issues, the present work demonstrates the power of the LAT to make\nhigh-energy \u03b3-ray observations and shows its potential for future discoveries. Although we\nfeel it premature to draw far-reaching conclusions, some results stand out.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nTable 3.

Figure 12 shows the locations of variable and\nnon-variable sources, in Galactic Coordinates.\n\u2022 The typical error radii for the sources (95% confidence) are less than 10\u2032 .\n\u2022 The Galactic latitude distribution of unassociated/unidentified \u03b3-ray sources is very\nnarrow (FWHM <0.5\u25e6 ). If we assume a scale height for a Galactic population of 40\npc (Guibert et al. 1978), such a narrow latitude distribution points to a Galactic \u03b3-ray\nsource population with average distance in excess of 40/sin0.5\u25e6 , namely 4.5 kpc.\n\n6.2.\n\nComparisons with Other High-Energy \u03b3-ray Results\n\nBefore F ermi, the EGRET results represented the most complete view of the highenergy sky, but those results applied to the 1991-2000 era. In light of the variability seen in\nthe EGRET \u03b3-ray sources, significant differences were expected. A contemporaneous mission\nto F ermi is AGILE, which began operations over a year before F ermi and continues to\noperate. Here is a summary of comparisons with these missions:\n\u2022 Of the 205 0FGL sources, 60 have nearby counterparts (the LAT source 95% uncertainty overlapping that of the EGRET source) found by the automated analysis in the\n3EG catalog (271 sources); 43 in the EGR catalog (189 sources). Most of the sources\nseen by EGRET in the 1990s were not seen by LAT as bright sources in 2008. Approximately 40% of the bright LAT sources off the plane that have no former EGRET\ncounterparts are found to be variable.\n\u2022 EGRET found few sources with flux less than 10 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons(E>100 MeV)\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . A number of the 0FGL sources have fluxes well below this value\n(e.g., 0FGL J0033.6\u22121921). Such sources would not have been visible to\nEGRET.\n\u2022 Some sources, such as 0FGL J0428.7\u22123755, associated with blazar PKS\n0426\u2212380, have flux values well above the EGRET threshold but were not\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\nseen by EGRET and yet are not noted as being variable in the 0FGL data.\nSuch sources serve as a reminder that blazars are variable on many time\nscales, and the 0FGL sample covers only three months.\n\u2022 Considering the highest-confidence sources, in its lifetime EGRET found 31 sources (in\neither the 3EG or EGR catalogs or both) with confidence level of >10-\u03c3. The 0FGL\nlist shows the dramatic improvement in sensitivity of the LAT.\n\u2022 Five of the EGRET sources seen at 10-\u03c3 significance (all associated with flaring blazars:\nNRAO 190, NRAO 530, 1611+343, 1406\u2212076, and 1622\u2212297) do not appear in the\nLAT bright source list.\n\u2022 28 of the EGRET sources that have counterparts in the 0FGL list were previously\nlisted as unidentified. Half of these, 14, have now been firmly identified in this early\nLAT analysis. 13 are pulsars; 1 is a HMXB.\n\u2022 Of the 40 sources in the first AGILE catalog (which is contemporaneous but does not\noverlap in time with the 0FGL data), 32 are also found in the 0FGL list and 7 more,\nwhile not formally overlapping, are \"near misses\" to 0FGL sources. The one exception\nis AGL J1238+04, a source associated with a FSRQ. A LAT source consistent in\nposition with this one is found at a lower significance during the first 3 months of\noperation, but the source has since flared (Tramacere & Rea 2009).\n\n6.3.\n\nSome Results from the Association Analysis\n\nTable 5 summarizes the census of associations in the Bright Source List. The numbers of these associations that are considered firm identifications are shown in\nparentheses.\n\u2022 The AGN class (121 members) is the largest source type associated in the LAT data.\nDetails of the analysis, together with the implications for AGN studies, are given by\nAbdo et al. (2009c). Two of the AGN found in this analysis are associated with radio\ngalaxies; the rest are categorized as blazars. Note that 5 of the 0FGL AGN are not\nincluded in the Abdo et al. (2009c) analysis, because they are found within 10\u25e6 of the\nGalactic Plane.\n\u2022 Pulsars, including young radio pulsars, millisecond radio pulsars, and radio-quiet pulsars, form another well-defined class (30 members) in the LAT bright source list.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n+90\n\n+180\n\n\u2212180\n\no variable\nx not variable\n\u221290\nFig. 12.- Locations of variable (circles) and non-variable (crosses) 0FGL sources, using\nthe definition of variability in Sec. 3.5.

The\nassociation of 0FGL J0240.3+6113 with LSI +61 303 is considered a firm identification\nbased on the orbital periodicity seen in the LAT emission (Abdo et al. 2009j). Analysis\nof LS 5039 is in progress.\n\u2022 Globular cluster NGC 104 = 47 Tuc is associated with LAT source 0FGL J0025.1\u22127202;\nit should be emphasized that this globular cluster contains at least 23 millisecond radio\npulsars and presumably contains many more as-yet undetected neutron stars.\n\u2022 0FGL J0538.4\u22126856 is seen in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The LMC\nX-ray pulsar associated with this source by the automated software (PSR J0537\u22126910)\nis one possibility. The source is also consistent with the direction of the 30 Doradus\nstar-forming region. Work on this part of the sky is still in progress.\n\u2022 0FGL J0617.4+2234 lies within the projected direction of the shell of SNR IC443.\nA TeV source has also been seen close to the position of the LAT source. Detailed\nanalysis of the LAT source is in progress.\n\u2022 0FGL J0910.2\u22125044, although visible in the summed map, was seen primarily as a\nGalactic transient in October, 2008 (Cheung et al. 2008).\n\u2022 0FGL J1746.0\u22122900 lies close to the Galactic Center. Modeling the diffuse emission in\nthis general region is challenging. We consider any conclusions about the association\nof this source with the Galactic Center or other candidate \u03b3-ray emitters in this region\nto be premature. The variability flag for this source is True, but the source is not\nextremely variable. This source barely met the criterion for being called variable.\nWork on this region is in progress.\n\u2022 37 of the 0FGL sources have no obvious counterparts at other wavelengths.\n6.4.\n\nTeV Comparisons\n\nAssociations with TeV sources are based in this work only on positional correlation.\nPhysical modeling or correlated variability would be needed in order to draw any conclusions\nfrom these associations. This is not an exhaustive list. We have omitted associations with\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\nblazars, well-known objects such as the Crab Nebula, and sources discussed previously in\nthe text.\n\u2022 0FGL J1024.0\u22125754 is spatially consistent with HESS J1023\u2212575, itself not yet firmly\nidentified, but noted for its possible connection to the young stellar cluster Westerlund\n2 in the star-forming region RCW49 (Aharonian et al. 2007).\n\u2022 0FGL J1418.8\u22126058 is spatially coincident with HESS J1418\u2212609 (Aharonian et al.\n2006a), which may be the PWN powered by the LAT-discovered LAT PSR J1418\u221260.\n\u2022 0FGL J1615.6\u22125049 is spatially coincident with HESS J1616-508, which has been\nsuspected being the PWN of PSR J1617\u22125055 (Landi et al. 2007), (Kargaltsev et al.\n2009).\n\u2022 OFGL J1741.4-3046 is spatially consistent with the unidentified HESS J1741-302.\n(Tibolla et al. 2008). See the note in the previous section about LAT analysis in\nthe Galactic Center region.\n\u2022 0FGL J1805.3\u22122138 is spatially coincident with HESS J1804\u2212216 (Aharonian et al.\n2005). Formally still unidentified, HESS J1804\u2212216 has been noted for possible counterparts in SNR G8.7\u22120.1, W30, or PSR J1803\u22122137. At this stage, we are not able to\nmake a firm identification of the LAT source with any of the counterpart hypotheses.\n\u2022 0FGL J1814.3\u22121739 is spatially coincident with HESS J1813\u2212178 (Aharonian et al.\n2005), which has been classified as a composite SNR, characterized by a shell-type SNR\nwith central PWN candidate, not to be distinguishable given the angular resolution of\npresent VHE observatories. At this stage, we are not able to settle either on a SNR\nor on a PSR/PWN scenario for connecting HESS J1813\u2212178 with the LAT source,\nleaving this study to a follow-up investigation.\n\u2022 0FGL J1834.4\u22120841 is spatially coincident with HESS J1834\u2212087 (Aharonian et al.\n2005). Formally still unidentified, HESS J1834\u2212087 was proposed to be explained in\nemission scenarios involving SNR W41, hadronic interactions with a giant molecular\ncloud, and/or PSR J1833\u22120827. See Table 2. PSR J1833\u22120827 is not consistent in\nposition with the LAT source. At this stage, we are not able to draw conclusions on a\npossible connection of the LAT source to the presented counterpart hypothesis.\n\u2022 OFGL J1923.0+1411 is spatially coincident with HESS J1923+141, which is also spatially consistent with SNR G49.2-0.7 (W51). See Sec. 4.2.3 and Table 2 for a discussion\nof LAT source associations with SNRs and PWNe.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\u2022 0FGL J2032.2+4122, conclusively identified as a PSR, is spatially coincident with\nTeV 2032+4130 seen by HEGRA (Aharonian et al. 2002) and Milagro source MGRO\nJ2031+41(Abdo et al. 2007). Formally still unidentified, TeV J2032+4130 was noted\nfor being close to the direction of the massive stellar cluster association Cygnus OB2.\nMGRO J2031+41, also unidentified, was reported as an extended and possibly confused\nsource that could only be explained in part by the emission from TeV 2032+4130. We\nleave the possible association of LAT PSR J2032+41 with TeV J2032+4130 or MGRO\n2031+41 to a detailed subsequent study.\n\u2022 Finally, it is noteworthy that LAT pulsars are found also in the error circles of four\nMilagro detected or candidate sources (Abdo et al. 2007):\n\u2013 0FGL J2020.8+3649 (MGRO 2019+37)\n\u2013 0FGL J1907.5+6002 (MGRO 1908+06)\n\u2013 0FGL J0634.0+1745 (C3 - candidate, Geminga)\n\u2013 0FGL J2229.0+6114 (C4 - candidate)\nDetailed discussion of individual sources is beyond the scope of this paper. By noting\nthese positional coincidences, we call attention to areas of work still in progress on the F ermi\nLAT data.
