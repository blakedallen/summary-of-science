In\ncodimension 1, we show compactness for such immersions for arbitrary fixed \u03bb < \u221e and\nuniformly bounded volume. The same result is shown in arbitrary codimension for \u03bb \u2264 41 .\n\n1. Introduction\nIn [14] J. Langer investigated compactness of immersed surfaces in R3 admitting uniform bounds on\nthe second fundamental form and the area of the surfaces. For a given sequence f i : \u03a3i \u2192 R3 , there\nexist, after passing to a subsequence, a limit surface f : \u03a3 \u2192 R3 and diffeomorphisms \u03c6i : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3i ,\nsuch that f i \u25e6 \u03c6i converges in the C 1 -topology to f . In particular, up to diffeomorphism, there are\nonly finitely many manifolds admitting such an immersion. The finiteness of topological types was\ngeneralized by K. Corlette in [6] to immersions of arbitrary dimension and codimension. Moreover, the\ncompactness theorem was generalized by S. Delladio in [7] to hypersurfaces of arbitrary dimension.\nThe general case, that is compactness in arbitrary dimension and codimension, was proved by the\nauthor in [4].\nThe proof strongly relies on a fundamental principle which we like to describe in the following. A\nsimple consequence of the implicit function theorem says that any immersion can locally be written\nas the graph of a function u : Br \u2192 Rk over the affine tangent space. Moreover, for a given \u03bb > 0\nwe can choose r > 0 small enough such that kDukC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb. If this is possible at any point of the\nimmersion with the same radius r, we call f an (r, \u03bb)-immersion.\nUsing the Sobolev embedding it can be shown that a uniform Lp -bound for the second fundamental\nform with p greater than the dimension implies that for any \u03bb > 0 there is an r > 0 such that every\nimmersion is an (r, \u03bb)-immersion.\nInspired by this result, it is a natural generalization to investigate compactness properties also for\n(r, \u03bb)-immersions with fixed r and \u03bb; this is the topic of the present paper. In the proof of the\ntheorem of Langer it is essential that \u03bb can be chosen very small. Then, using the local graph representation over Br , all immersions are close to each other and nearly flat. These properties are used\nrepeatedly, for example for the construction of the diffeomorphism \u03c6i .\nHere, we would first like to show compactness of (r, \u03bb)-immersions in codimension 1 for any fixed\n\u03bb. We do not require any smallness assumption for \u03bb. Moreover, we do not only consider immersions\nwith graph representations over the affine tangent space, but also over other appropriately chosen\nm-spaces. Let F1 (r, \u03bb) be the set of C 1 -immersions f : M m \u2192 Rm+1 with 0 \u2208 f (M ), which may\n1 P.\n\nBreuning was supported by the DFG-Forschergruppe Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations: Theoretical and\nNumerical Analysis.

Introduction\nlocally be written over an m-space as the graph of a \u03bb-Lipschitz function u : Br \u2192 R (the precise\ndefinitions of all notations used in this paper are given in Section 2). Here all manifolds are assumed\nto be compact. Moreover, let F1V (r, \u03bb) be the set of immersions in F1 (r, \u03bb) with vol(M ) \u2264 V. Similarly,\nwe define the set F0 (r, \u03bb) by replacing C 1 -immersions in F1 (r, \u03bb) by Lipschitz functions. We obtain\nthe following compactness result:\nTheorem 1.1 (Compactness of (r, \u03bb)-immersions in codimension one)\nThe set F1V (r, \u03bb) is relatively compact in F0 (r, \u03bb) in the following sense:\nLet f i : M i \u2192 Rm+1 be a sequence in F1V (r, \u03bb). Then, after passing to a subsequence, there exist an\nf : M \u2192 Rm+1 in F0 (r, \u03bb) and a sequence of diffeomorphisms \u03c6i : M \u2192 M i , such that f i \u25e6 \u03c6i is\nuniformly Lipschitz bounded and converges uniformly to f .\nHere the Lipschitz bound for f i \u25e6 \u03c6i is shown with respect to the local representations of some finite\natlas of M . For these representations, we obtain a Lipschitz constant L depending only on \u03bb. As an\nimmediate consequence of Theorem 1.1 we deduce the following corollary:\nCorollary 1.2 There are only finitely many manifolds in F1V (r, \u03bb) up to diffeomorphism.\nThe situation is slightly different when considering (r, \u03bb)-immersions in arbitrary codimension. For the\nconstruction of the diffeomorphisms \u03c6i one uses a kind of projection in an averaged normal direction \u03bd.\nIn higher codimension, the averaged normal \u03bd cannot be constructed as in the case of hypersurfaces.\nWe will give an alternative construction involving a Riemannian center of mass. However, for doing\nso we have to assume here that \u03bb is not too large. Let F1V (r, \u03bb) and F0 (r, \u03bb) be defined as above, but\nthis time for functions with values in Rm+k for a fixed k. We obtain the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.3 (Compactness of (r, \u03bb)-immersions in arbitrary codimension)\nLet \u03bb \u2264 14 . Then F1V (r, \u03bb) is relatively compact in F0 (r, \u03bb) in the sense of Theorem 1.1.\nAs in Corollary 1.2, we deduce for \u03bb \u2264 41 that there are only finitely many manifolds in F1V (r, \u03bb) up to\ndiffeomorphism. Surely, the bound \u03bb \u2264 14 is not optimal; at the end of Section 6 we will discuss some\npossibilities how to prove the theorem for bigger Lipschitz constant.\nIn [14] and [4] any sequence of immersions with Lp -bounded second fundamental form, p > m, is\nshown to be also a sequence of (r, \u03bb)-immersions (for some fixed r and \u03bb). The same conclusion holds\nin many other situations, where the geometric data (such as curvature bounds) ensure uniform graph\nrepresentations with control over the slope of the graphs. Hence it seems natural to unearth the compactness of (r, \u03bb)-immersions as a theorem on its own. In any general situation, where compactness\nof immersions is desired (e.g. when considering convergence of geometric flows), only the condition of\nDefinition 2.2 in Section 2 has to be verified. If in addition some bound for higher derivatives of the\ngraph functions is known (or for instance a C 0,\u03b1 -bound for Du), with methods as in [4] one easily\nderives additional properties of the limit, such as higher order differentiability or curvature bounds.\nHence, Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 can be seen as the most general kind of compactness theorem in this\ncontext.\n\nAcknowledgement: I would like to thank my advisor Ernst Kuwert for his support. Moreover I\nwould like to thank Manuel Breuning for proofreading my dissertation [3], where the results of this\npaper were established first.\n\n2\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\n\n2. Definitions and preliminaries\nWe begin with some general notations: For n = m + k let Gn,m denote the Grassmannian of (nonoriented) m-dimensional subspaces of Rn . Unless stated otherwise let B\u033a denote the open ball in Rm\nof radius \u033a > 0 centered at the origin.\nNow let M be an m-dimensional manifold without boundary and f : M \u2192 Rn a C 1 -immersion.\nLet q \u2208 M and let Tq M be the tangent space at q. Identifying vectors X \u2208 Tq M with f\u2217 X \u2208 Tf (q) Rn ,\nwe may consider Tq M as an m-dimensional subspace of Rn . Let (Tq M )\u22a5 denote the orthogonal\ncomplement of Tq M in Rn , that is\nRn = Tq M \u2295 (Tq M )\u22a5\nand (Tq M )\u22a5 is perpendicular to Tq M . In this manner we may define a tangent and a normal map\n\u03c4f : M\nq\n\n\u2192 Gn,m ,\n7\n\u2192\nTq M,\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u03bdf : M\nq\n\n\u2192 Gn,k ,\n7\n\u2192\n(Tq M )\u22a5 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nand\n\nThe notion of an (r, \u03bb)-immersion:\nWe call a mapping A : Rn \u2192 Rn a Euclidean isometry, if there is a rotation R \u2208 SO(n) and a\ntranslation T \u2208 Rn , such that A(x) = Rx + T for all x \u2208 Rn .\nFor a given point q \u2208 M let Aq : Rn \u2192 Rn be a Euclidean isometry, which maps the origin to\nf (q), and the subspace Rm \u00d7 {0} \u2282 Rm \u00d7 Rk onto f (q) + \u03c4f (q). Let \u03c0 : Rn \u2192 Rm be the standard\nprojection onto the first m coordinates.\n\u22121\n(Br ). Although the isometry\nFinally let Ur,q \u2282 M be the q-component of the set (\u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\nq \u25e6 f)\nAq is not uniquely determined, the set Ur,q does not depend on the choice of Aq .\n\nWe come to the central definition (as first defined in [14]):\nDefinition 2.1 An immersion f is called an (r, \u03bb)-immersion, if for each point q \u2208 M the set A\u22121\nq \u25e6\nk\nf (Ur,q ) is the graph of a differentiable function u : Br \u2192 R with kDukC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb.\n\nHere, for any x \u2208 Br we have Du(x) \u2208 Rk\u00d7m . In order to define the C 0 -norm for Du, we have to fix\na matrix norm for Du(x). Of course all norms on Rk\u00d7m are equivalent, therefore our results are true\nfor any norm (possibly up to multiplication by some positive constant). Let us agree upon\n!12\nm\nX\n2\n|aj |\nkAk =\nj=1\n\nfor A = (a1 , . . . , am ) \u2208 Rk\u00d7m . For this norm we have kAkop \u2264 kAk for any A \u2208 Rk\u00d7m and the operator norm k * kop . Hence the bound kDukC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb directly implies that u is \u03bb-Lipschitz. Moreover\nthe norm kDukC 0 (Br ) does not depend on the choice of the isometry Aq .\n\n3\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nThe notion of a generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersion:\nFor any (r, \u03bb)-immersion f : M \u2192 Rn and any q \u2208 M , we have a local graph representation over\nthe affine tangent space f (q) + \u03c4f (q). It is natural to extend this definition to immersions with local\ngraph representations over other appropriately chosen m-spaces in Rn .\nFor a given q \u2208 M and a given m-space E \u2208 Gn,m let Aq,E : Rn \u2192 Rn be a Euclidean isometry,\nwhich maps the origin to f (q), and the subspace Rm \u00d7 {0} \u2282 Rm \u00d7 Rk onto f (q) + E.\nE\n\u22121\nLet Ur,q\n\u2282 M be the q-component of the set (\u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\n(Br ). Again the isometry Aq,E is\nq,E \u25e6 f )\nE\nnot uniquely determined but the set Ur,q does not depend on the choice of Aq,E .\n\nDefinition 2.2 An immersion f is called a generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersion, if for each point\nE\nq \u2208 M there is an E = E(q) \u2208 Gn,m , such that the set A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f (Ur,q ) is the graph of a differentiable function u : Br \u2192 Rk with kDukC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb.\nObviously every (r, \u03bb)-immersion is a generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersion, as we can choose E(q) = \u03c4f (q) for\nany q \u2208 M .\nFor fixed dimension m and codimension k we denote by F1 (r, \u03bb) the set of generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersions\nf : M \u2192 Rm+k with 0 \u2208 f (M ), where M is any compact m-manifold without boundary. For V > 0\nwe denote by F1V (r, \u03bb) the set of all immersions in F1 (r, \u03bb) with vol(M ) \u2264 V. Here the volume of M\nis measured with respect to the volume measure induced by the metric f \u2217 geucl. Note that M is not\nfixed in these sets (in order to obtain a set in a strict set theoretical sense one may consider every\nmanifold as embedded in RN for an N = N (m)). The condition 0 \u2208 f (M ) can be weakened in many\napplications to f (M ) \u2229 K 6= \u2205 for a compact set K \u2282 Rm+k .\nThe notion of a generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersion has one major advantage: As the definition does not\nmake use of the existence of a tangent space, it allows us to define similar notions for functions into\nE\nRn which are not immersed. For a given E \u2208 Gn,m the set Ur,q\ncan be defined for any continuous\nn\nfunction f : M \u2192 R . Moreover the condition kDukC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb in the smooth case corresponds\nto a Lipschitz bound of the function u. Hence the following definition can be seen as the natural\ngeneralization to continuous functions:\nDefinition 2.3 A continuous function f is called an (r, \u03bb)-function, if for each point q \u2208 M there is\nE\nan E = E(q) \u2208 Gn,m , such that the set A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f (Ur,q ) is the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function\nu : Br \u2192 Rk with Lipschitz constant \u03bb.\nE\nWe additionally assume here, that E can be chosen such that f is injective on Ur,q\n. This property is\nnot implied by the preceding definition, if one reads the latter word for word.\n\nWe shall always consider (r, \u03bb)-functions defined on compact topological manifolds (without boundary). Using the local Lipschitz graph representation, any such manifold can be endowed with an atlas\nwith bi-Lipschitz change of coordinates. If the Lipschitz constant of the graphs is sufficiently small\n(and hence the coordinate changes are almost isometric with bi-Lipschitz constant close to 1), by the\nresults in [13] there exists even a smooth atlas. In our case, the limit manifold both in Theorem 1.1\nand 1.3 will be smooth.\nFinally, we define the set F0 (r, \u03bb) by replacing generalized (r, \u03bb)-immersions in F1 (r, \u03bb) by (r, \u03bb)functions.\n\n4\n\n\f2.

Moreover there is a Riemannian metric g on Gn,k being invariant under the action of O(n)\nin Rn . It is unique up to multiplication by a positive constant (and - again up to multiplication by\na positive constant - the only metric being invariant under the action of SO(n) in Rn except for the\ncase G4,2 ).

This applies to the Grassmannian as Gn,k is complete.\nNow suppose that E, G \u2208 Gn,k are two close k-planes; this means that the projection of each onto the\nother is non-degenerate. Applying a transformation to principal axes, there are orthonormal bases\n{v1 , . . . , vk } of E and {w1 , . . . , wk } of G such that\nh \u03c0\u0011\nhvi , wj i = \u03b4ij cos \u03b8i with \u03b8i \u2208 0,\n2\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k. For given k-spaces E and G, the \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8k are uniquely determined (up to the order)\nand called the principal angles between E and G. Under all metrics on Gn,k being invariant under\nthe action of O(n), there is exactly one metric g with\n\nd(E, G) =\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b8i2\n\n! 21\n\nfor all close k-planes E and G, where d denotes the distance corresponding to g, and \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8k the\nprincipal angles between E and G as defined above; see [2] and the references given there. We shall\nalways use this distinguished metric.\nWe will need the following estimate for the sectional curvatures of a Grassmannian:\nLemma 2.4 Let max{k, n \u2212 k} \u2265 2. Let K(*, *) denote the sectional curvature of Gn,k and let\nX, Y \u2208 TP Gn,k be linearly independent tangent vectors for a P \u2208 Gn,k . Then\n0 \u2264 K(X, Y ) \u2264 2.\nProof:\nFor min{k, n \u2212 k} = 1 all sectional curvatures are constant with K(X, Y ) = 1. For a proof see [16], p.\n351. For min{k, n \u2212 k} \u2265 2 we have 0 \u2264 K(X, Y ) \u2264 2 by [17], Theorem 3.\n\u0003\nThe injectivity radius of Gn,k is \u03c02 (see [2], p. 53). A subset U of a Riemannian manifold (M, g)\nis said to be convex, if and only if for each p, q \u2208 U the shortest geodesic from p to q is unique in M\nand lies entirely in U . For the Grassmannian Gn,k , any open Riemannian ball B\u033a (P ) around P \u2208 Gn,k\nwith \u033a < \u03c04 is convex; see [8], p. 228.\n\n5\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nThe Riemannian center of mass\nThe well-known Euclidean center of mass may be generalized to a Riemannian center of mass on\nRiemannian manifolds. This was introduced by K. Grove and H. Karcher in [9]. A simplified treatment is given in [13]. See also [11]. We like to give a short sketch of this concept.\nLet (M, g) be a complete Riemannian manifold with induced distance d as in (2.3). Let \u03bc be a\nprobability measure on M , i.e. a nonnegative measure with\nZ\n\u03bc(M ) =\nd\u03bc = 1.\nM\n\nLet q be a point in M and B\u033a = B\u033a (q) a convex open ball of radius \u033a around q in M . Suppose\nspt \u03bc \u2282 B\u033a ,\nwhere spt \u03bc denotes the support of \u03bc. We define a function\n\u2192 R,\nZ\nd(p, x)2 d\u03bc(x).\nP (p) =\n\nP : B\u033a\n\nM\n\nDefinition 2.5 A q \u2208 B \u033a is called a center of mass for \u03bc if\nZ\nP (q) = inf\nd(p, x)2 d\u03bc(x).\np\u2208B \u033a\n\nM\n\nThe following theorem asserts the existence and uniqueness of a center of mass:\nTheorem 2.6 If the sectional curvatures of M in B\u033a are at most \u03ba with 0 < \u03ba < \u221e and if \u033a is small\nenough such that \u033a < 41 \u03c0\u03ba\u22121/2 , then P is a strictly convex function on B\u033a and has a unique minimum\npoint in B \u033a which lies in B\u033a and is the unique center of mass for \u03bc.\nProof:\nSee [13], Theorem 1.2 and the following pages there.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the preceding theorem, we do not require the bound \u03ba to be attained; in particular all sectional\ncurvatures are also allowed to be less than or equal to 0. The same applies to the following lemma:\nLemma 2.7 Assume that the sectional curvatures of M in B\u033a are at most \u03ba with 0 < \u03ba < \u221e and\n\u033a < 14 \u03c0\u03ba\u22121/2 . Let \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 be two probability measures on M with spt \u03bc1 \u2282 B\u033a , spt \u03bc2 \u2282 B\u033a with centers\nof mass q1 , q2 respectively. Then for a universal constant C = C(\u03ba, \u033a) < \u221e\nZ\nd(q2 , x) d|\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 |(x),\nd(q1 , q2 ) \u2264 C\nM\n\nwhere |\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 | denotes the total variation measure of the signed measure \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 .\nProof:\nLet Pi (p) =\n\n1\n2\n\nR\n\nM\n\nd(p, x)2 d\u03bci (x) for i = 1, 2. By Theorem 1.5.1 in [13], with\nC = C(\u03ba, \u033a) := 1 + (\u03ba1/2 \u033a)\u22121 tan(2\u03ba 1/2 \u033a),\n\nwe have for all y \u2208 B\u033a the estimate\nd(q1 , y) \u2264 C |grad P1 (y)|.\n\n6\n\n(2.4)\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nUsing spt \u03bci \u2282 B\u033a , by Theorem 1.2 in [13] we have\nZ\nexp\u22121\ngrad Pi (y) = \u2212\ny (x) d\u03bci (x),\n\n(2.5)\n\nB\u033a\n\nwhere exp\u22121\ny : B\u033a \u2192 Ty M is considered as a vector valued function.\nMoreover, as q2 is a center of mass,\ngrad P2 (q2 ) = 0.\nThen with the argumentation of [11], Lemma 4.8.7 (where manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature\nare considered) we have\nd(q1 , q2 ) \u2264\n=\n\nC |grad P1 (q2 )|\nZ\nC\nexp\u22121\nq2 (x) d\u03bc1 (x)\nB\u033a\n\n=\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nB\u033a\n\n\u2264\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nexp\u22121\nq2 (x) d\u03bc1 (x)\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nB\u033a\n\nexp\u22121\nq2 (x) d\u03bc2 (x)\n\nd(q2 , x) d|\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 |(x),\n\nM\n\nwhere we used | exp\u22121\nq2 (x)| = d(q2 , x) and spt \u03bci \u2282 B\u033a in the last line.\n\n\u0003\n\nBasics for the proof\nWe like to fix some further notation and to deduce some basic facts that are needed in the proof.\nFirst of all let us simplify the notation. For a given (r, \u03bb)-immersion f : M \u2192 Rm+1 and for every q \u2208 M we can choose an Eq \u2208 Gm+1,m with the properties of Definition 2.2. This yields a\nmapping E : M \u2192 Gm+1,m , q 7\u2192 Eq . For every (r, \u03bb)-immersion we choose and fix such a mapping\nE. So every given (r, \u03bb)-immersion f can be thought of as a pair (f, E), even if E is not explicitly\nE(q)\nmentioned in the notation. With Aq,E(q) and Ur,q as in Definition 2.2, we set\nAq := Aq,E(q)\nand for 0 < \u033a \u2264 r\nE(q)\nU\u033a,q := U\u033a,q\n.\n\nIn fact this means that Aq and U\u033a,q also depend on E(q). However, all properties shown below for\nU\u033a,q are true for any admissible choice of E.\nAs an analogue to Lemma 3.1 in [14] we obtain the following statement, where f is assumed to be a\ngeneralized (r, \u03bb)-immersion here:\nLemma 2.8 Let f : M \u2192 Rm+1 be an (r, \u03bb)-immersion and p, q \u2208 M .\na) If 0 < \u033a \u2264 r and p \u2208 U\u033a,q , then |f (q) \u2212 f (p)| < (1 + \u03bb)\u033a.\nb) If 0 < \u033a \u2264 r and \u03b4 = [3(1 + \u03bb)]\u22121 \u033a and U\u03b4,q \u2229 U\u03b4,p 6= \u2205, then U\u03b4,p \u2282 U\u033a,q .\n\n7\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nProof:\na) Pass to the graph representation, use the bound on the C 0 -norm of the derivative of the graph\nand the triangular inequality.\nb) Let x \u2208 U\u03b4,p and y \u2208 U\u03b4,q \u2229 U\u03b4,p . With \u03c6q := \u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\nq \u25e6 f we have\n|\u03c6q (x)|\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\n|f (x) \u2212 f (q)|\n|f (x) \u2212 f (p)| + |f (p) \u2212 f (y)| + |f (y) \u2212 f (q)|\n\n<\n=\n\n3(1 + \u03bb)\u03b4\n\u033a.\n\nHence U\u03b4,p \u2282 \u03c6\u22121\nq (B\u033a ). But U\u03b4,p \u222a U\u03b4,q is a connected set containing q, hence included in the\nq-component of \u03c6\u22121\n\u0003\nq (B\u033a ), that is in U\u033a,q . We conclude U\u03b4,p \u2282 U\u033a,q .\n\nNow let r, \u03bb > 0 be given. For l \u2208 N0 define \u03b4l := [3(1+\u03bb)]\u2212l r. For an (r, \u03bb)-immersion f : M \u2192 Rm+1 ,\nby Lemma 2.8 b) we have the following important property:\nIf p, q \u2208 M and U\u03b4l+1 ,q \u2229 U\u03b4l+1 ,p 6= \u2205, then U\u03b4l+1 ,p \u2282 U\u03b4l ,q .\n\n(2.6)\n\nIf f : M \u2192 Rm+1 is an (r, \u03bb)-immersion and p \u2208 M , we may use the local graph representation to\nconclude that the set f (Ur,p ) is homeomorphic to the ball Br . Hence we may choose a continuous\nunit normal \u03bdp : Ur,p \u2192 Sm with respect to f |Ur,p . If q \u2208 M is another point and \u03bdq : Ur,q \u2192 Sm\na continuous unit normal on Ur,q , we note that \u03bdp and \u03bdq do not necessarily coincide on Ur,p \u2229 Ur,q .\nHowever, we have the following statement:\nLemma 2.9 Let f : M \u2192 Rm+1 be an (r, \u03bb)-immersion and p, q \u2208 M . Let \u03bdp : U\u03b41 ,p \u2192 Sm ,\n\u03bdq : U\u03b41 ,q \u2192 Sm be continuous unit normals. Suppose U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q 6= \u2205. Then exactly one of the\nfollowing two statements is true:\n\u2022 \u03bdp (x) = \u03bdq (x)\n\nfor every x \u2208 U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q ,\n\n\u2022 \u03bdp (x) = \u2212\u03bdq (x) for every x \u2208 U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q .\nProof:\nChoose a \u03be \u2208 U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q . First suppose that \u03bdp (\u03be) = \u03bdq (\u03be). As Ur,p is homeomorphic to Br and\nconnected, there are exactly two continuous unit normals on Ur,p . Let \u03bd be the one with \u03bd(\u03be) = \u03bdp (\u03be).\nLet W = {x \u2208 U\u03b41 ,p : \u03bd(x) = \u03bdp (x)}. Then W is a nonempty subset of the connected set U\u03b41 ,p .\nMoreover W is easily seen to be open and closed in U\u03b41 ,p . Therefore W = U\u03b41 ,p and \u03bdp = \u03bd on\nU\u03b41 ,p . As U\u03b41 ,q \u2282 Ur,p by (2.6), the preceding argumentation can also be applied to \u03bdq . With\n\u03bd(\u03be) = \u03bdp (\u03be) = \u03bdq (\u03be) we conclude \u03bdq = \u03bd on U\u03b41 ,q . Hence \u03bdp = \u03bd = \u03bdq on U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q , as in the claim\nabove. If \u03bdp (\u03be) = \u2212\u03bdq (\u03be), a similar argumentation yields \u03bdp = \u2212\u03bdq on U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.10 The statement of the preceding lemma might seem to be obvious at first sight. However\none can think of a M\u00f6bius strip covered by two open sets U and V , each of which is homeomorphic to\nBr , such that U \u2229 V has exactly two components. If we choose continuous unit normals \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 on U, V\nrespectively, we have \u03bd1 = \u03bd2 on one of the components, and \u03bd1 = \u2212\u03bd2 on the other. Such a behavior\nof the normals is excluded by Lemma 2.9, irrespective whether U\u03b41 ,p \u2229 U\u03b41 ,q is connected or not.\n\nWe need the notion of a \u03b4-net:\n\n8\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nDefinition 2.11 Let Q = {q1 , . . . , qs } be a finite set of points in M and let 0 < \u03b4 < r. We say that\ns\nS\nU\u03b4,qj .\nQ is a \u03b4-net for f , if M =\nj=1\n\nNote that every \u03b4-net is also a \u03b4 \u2032 -net if 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b4 \u2032 < r.\nThe following statement is a bit stronger than Lemma 3.2 in [14]. It bounds the number of elements in\na \u03b4-net by an argumentation similar to that in the proof of Vitali's covering theorem. Simultaneously,\nsimilarly to Besicovitch's covering theorem, it gives a bound (which does not depend on the volume)\nhow often any fixed point in M is covered by the net. More precisely, we have the following lemma:\nLemma 2.12 For l \u2208 N, every (r, \u03bb)-immersion on a compact m-manifold M admits a \u03b4l -net Q with\n|Q| \u2264\n|{q \u2208 Q : p \u2208 U\u03b42 ,q }| \u2264\n\n\u2212m\n\u03b4l+1\nvol(M ),\n\n[3(1 + \u03bb)](l+1)m\n\nfor every fixed p \u2208 M.\n\nProof:\nLet q1 \u2208 M be an arbitrary point. Assume we have found points {q1 , . . . , q\u03bd } in M with the property\nU\u03b4l+1 ,qj \u2229 U\u03b4l+1 ,qk = \u2205 for j 6= k. Suppose U\u03b4l ,q1 \u222a . . . \u222a U\u03b4l ,q\u03bd does not cover M . Then choose a point\nq\u03bd+1 from the complement. Then U\u03b4l+1 ,qk \u2229 U\u03b4l+1 ,q\u03bd+1 = \u2205 for k \u2264 \u03bd, as otherwise U\u03b4l+1 ,q\u03bd+1 \u2282 U\u03b4l ,qk\nby (2.6).

Let Q = {q1 , . . . , qs } be the net that we found above. Moreover let Z(p) = {q \u2208 Q : p \u2208 U\u03b42 ,q }. By Lemma 2.8 b) we have\n[\nU\u03b42 ,q \u2282 U\u03b41 ,p .\nq\u2208Z(p)\n\nHence we may estimate as above\nvol(U\u03b41 ,p )\n\nX\n\n\u2265\n\nvol(U\u03b4l+1 ,q )\n\nq\u2208Z(p)\n\n(2.7)\n\nm\n\u2265 |Z(p)|\u03b4l+1\nLm (B1 ).\n\nAs the immersion is an (r, \u03bb)-immersion, we have\nvol(U\u03b41 ,p ) \u2264 (1 + \u03bb)m \u03b41m Lm (B1 ).\n\n(2.8)\n\nCombining (2.7) and (2.8), we estimate\n|Z(p)| \u2264\n=\n\n\u2212m\n(1 + \u03bb)m \u03b41m \u03b4l+1\n\n3lm (1 + \u03bb)(l+1)m ,\n\nwhich implies the statement.\n\n\u0003\n\n9\n\n\f2. Definitions and preliminaries\nWe would like to emphasize that the second estimate in the preceding lemma does not depend on the\nvolume vol(M ). This will be necessary in order to obtain estimates for Lipschitz constants and for\nangles between different spaces depending only on \u03bb but not on vol(M ).\n\nDefinition 2.13 Let f : M \u2192 Rm+1 be an (r, \u03bb)-immersion.

Transversality and tubular neighborhoods\nFinally we like to define again a metric for graph systems. First of all let\nGs = {(Aj , uj )sj=1 : Aj : Rm+1 \u2192 Rm+1 is a Euclidean isometry, uj \u2208 C 1 (B r )}.\nEvery Euclidean isometry A : Rm+1 \u2192 Rm+1 splits uniquely into a rotation R \u2208 SO(m + 1) and\na translation T \u2208 Rm+1 . If k * k denotes the operator norm and if \u0393 = (Aj , uj )sj=1 \u2208 Gs , \u0393\u0303 =\n(\u00c3j , \u0169j )sj=1 \u2208 Gs , we set\nd(*, *) : Gs \u00d7 Gs\n\n\u2192 R,\ns\nX\n(kRj \u2212 R\u0303j k + |Tj \u2212 T\u0303j | + kuj \u2212 \u0169j kC 0 (Br ) ).\nd(\u0393, \u0393\u0303) =\n\n(2.12)\n\nj=1\n\nThis makes (Gs , d) a metric space.\n\n3. Transversality and tubular neighborhoods\nIn this section we like to construct lines in Rm+1 , that intersect each (appropriately restricted) immersion f i transversally - even in the case, that the Lipschitz constant \u03bb of the graph functions is\nlarge. This yields local tubular neighborhoods around f i and is the crucial step in the proof.\nLet r > 0 and \u03bb, V < \u221e. Let f i : M i \u2192 Rm+1 be a sequence of (r, \u03bb)-immersions as in Theorem 1.1. With Lemma 2.12 choose \u03b45 -nets Qi = {q1i , . . . , qsi i } for M i with at most \u03b46\u2212m vol(M i )\nelements respectively and with\n|{q \u2208 Qi : p \u2208 U\u03b4i2 ,q }| \u2264 [3(1 + \u03bb)]6m\n\nfor every fixed p \u2208 M i .\n\n(3.1)\n\nAs vol(M i ) \u2264 V, we may pass to a subsequence such that each net has exactly s points for a fixed s \u2208 N.\nFor every i \u2208 N, \u03b9 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 5} and j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} we have\n|Z\u03b9i (j)| \u2264 |P({1, . . . , s})| = 2s .\nHence, by successively passing to subsequences, we may assume\nZ\u03b9i (j) = Z\u03b9 (j)\n\n(3.2)\n\nfor every i, j and \u03b9 for fixed sets Z\u03b9 (j).\ni\ni\nTo simplify the notation, for 0 < \u033a \u2264 r we set U\u033a,j\n:= U\u033a,q\ni.\nj\n\ni\nMoreover, we choose for every i \u2208 N and every j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} a continuous unit normal \u03bdji : Ur,j\n\u2192 Sm\ni\ni\nwith respect to f |Ur,j . Let these normal mappings be fixed from now on.\n\nFor S \u2282 Sm let S be the closure of S with respect to the metric d defined in (2.9). We set\nSji := \u03bdji (U\u03b4i1 ,j ) \u2282 Sm .\nFor each fixed j, this yields a sequence (Sji )i\u2208N in S. By Lemma 2.14 we can pass successively to\nsubsequences in order to obtain a sequence with\nSji \u2192 Sj\u2032 in (S, dH ) as i \u2192 \u221e\n\n12\n\n\f3.

This yields the corresponding graph systems \u0393i =\n(Aij , uij )sj=1 \u2208 Gs . As kDuij kC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb and as f i (M i ) is uniformly bounded, a subsequence of (\u0393i )i\u2208N\nconverges in (Gs , d). In particular\n\n(\u0393i )i\u2208N is a Cauchy sequence in (Gs , d).\n\n(3.5)\n\nLet constants L, \u03b3 and \u03c3 be defined by\nL :=\n\u03b3\n\n:=\n\n\u03c3\n\n:=\n\n[3(1 + \u03bb)]6m+4 r\u22121 ,\n1\n\u03c0\n+ arctan \u03bb,\n4\n2\ncos2 \u03b3\n.\n2L(1 + \u03bb)\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\nBy (3.5) we may pass to another subsequence such that\nd(\u0393k , \u0393l ) < [3(1 + \u03bb)(1 + r)]\u22121 \u03c3\n\nfor all k, l \u2208 N.\n\n(3.9)\n\nFor i = 1 we sometimes suppress the index 1 and write for instance qj and uj instead of qj1 and u1j . For\nthe immersion f 1 , let E 1 : M 1 \u2192 Gm+1,m be a mapping as explained in the beginning of Chapter 3.1.\nWe set Ej := E 1 (qj1 ) \u2208 Gm+1,m (this means Ej is an m-space for the point qj1 \u2208 M 1 as in Definition\n2.2).\nOur next task is to find a mapping \u03c9 : M 1 \u2192 Gm+1,1 , which defines the direction in which we\nproject from f 1 (M 1 ) onto f i (M i ) in order to construct diffeomorphisms \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i . First we\nwould like to give a local construction. In Lemma 3.5 we will show that \u03c9 is even globally well-defined.\nThe construction is similar to that in [14], but more involved.\nWe choose a C \u221e -function g : R\u22650 \u2192 R with the following properties:\n\u2022 g(t) = 1 for t <\n\n\u03b41\nr ,\n\n\u2022 0 \u2264 g(t) \u2264 1 for t \u2208 [ \u03b4r1 , 1],\n\u2022 g(t) = 0 for t > 1,\n\u2022 \u22122 \u2264 g \u2032 (t) \u2264 0 for all t > 0.\nWe note that\n\n\u03b41\nr\n\n= [3(1 + \u03bb)]\u22121 \u2264 13 , hence such a function g exists.\n\nLet\nZ : M1\n\n\u2192\n\nP({1, . . . , s}),\n\nq\n\n7\u2192\n\n{1 \u2264 k \u2264 s : q \u2208 U\u03b412 ,k }.\n\n13\n\n\f3.

Let these vectors w1 , . . . , ws be fixed from now on.\nNow let j \u2208 {1, . . . , s}, q \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j and k \u2208 Z(q). Lemma 2.8 b) yields\n1\nU\u03b411 ,j \u2282 Ur,k\n.\n\nIn particular f 1 (U\u03b411 ,j ) is the graph of a \u03bb-Lipschitz function on a subset of Ek .

Intersection points and definition of \u03c6i\nIn this section we like to show that for p \u2208 M 1 the line f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects each appropriately\nrestricted immersion f i (M i ) in exactly one point. Using this, we are able to give a definition of the\nmappings \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i . Each \u03c6i will be shown to be a diffeomorphism. Moreover, it will be shown\nthat f i \u25e6 \u03c6i is uniformly Lipschitz bounded.\nLemma 4.1 For p \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j the line f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects the set f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ) in exactly one point. This\npoint lies in f i (U\u03b4i2 ,j ).\nProof:\nLet p \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j . First we show that f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects f i (U\u03b4i2 ,j ). By Lemma 3.1 b) we have\n\u2222(T (p), \u03bdji (q)) \u2264\n\n\u03c0\n1\n+ arctan \u03bb\n4\n2\n\nfor every q \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,j .\n\n(4.1)\n\nLet G = {(x, y) \u2208 U\u03b4i2 ,j \u00d7 Rm+1 : y \u2208 \u03c9(p)}. We note here that \u03c9(p) does not depend on x. Let the\nfunction F be defined by\nF :\n\nG\n(x, y)\n\n\u2192 Rm+1 ,\n7\u2192 f (x) + y,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere y \u2208 \u03c9(p). With an argumentation as in Lemma 3.4, using (4.1) and the fact that \u03c9(p)\nis constant, we conclude that F (G) forms a tubular neighborhood around f i (U\u03b4i2 ,j ), and moreover\nB\u03c3 (f i (U\u03b4i3 ,j )) \u2282 F (G) with \u03c3 as in (3.8).\nWe would like to show that f 1 (U\u03b413 ,j ) \u2282 B\u03c3 (f i (U\u03b4i3 ,j )). For that let p\u2032 \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j . Then there is a unique\nx \u2208 B\u03b43 with f 1 (p\u2032 ) = A1j (x, u1j (x)). Moreover there is a unique q \u2032 \u2208 U\u03b4i3 ,j with f i (q \u2032 ) = Aij (x, uij (x)).\nWe estimate\n|f i (q \u2032 ) \u2212 f 1 (p\u2032 )| =\n\n|Aij (x, uij (x)) \u2212 A1j (x, u1j (x))|\n\n=\n\n|Rji (x, uij (x)) + Tji \u2212 Rj1 (x, u1j (x)) \u2212 Tj1 |\n\n\u2264\n\n|Rji (x, uij (x)) \u2212 Rji (x, u1j (x))| + |Rji (x, u1j (x)) \u2212 Rj1 (x, u1j (x))| + |Tji \u2212 Tj1 |\n\n=\n\n|Rji ((x, uij (x)) \u2212 (x, u1j (x)))| + |(Rji \u2212 Rj1 )(x, u1j (x))| + |Tji \u2212 Tj1 |\n\n\u2264\n\n|uij (x) \u2212 u1j (x)| + kRji \u2212 Rj1 k|(x, u1j (x))| + |Tji \u2212 Tj1 |\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3\n+ +\n3\n3\n3\n\u03c3,\n\n<\n=\n\nwhere in the sixth line we used |(x, u1j (x))| \u2264 (1 + \u03bb)r and d(\u03931 , \u0393i ) < [3(1 + \u03bb)(1 + r)]\u22121 \u03c3 which follows from (3.9). Hence f 1 (U\u03b413 ,j ) \u2282 B\u03c3 (f i (U\u03b4i3 ,j )), i.e. f 1 (U\u03b413 ,j ) lies within the tubular neighborhood\ndefined above. But this means that there is a q \u2208 U\u03b4i2 ,j such that f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) equals f i (q) + \u03c9(p).\nHence f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects f i (U\u03b4i2 ,j ) in the point f i (q).\nIt remains to show that f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ) in not more than one point. By (4.1) we\nhave \u2222(T (p), \u03bdji (q)) < \u03c02 for every q \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,j . By the definition of \u03c9 this implies Rm+1 = \u03c4f i (q) \u2295 \u03c9(p)\nfor every q \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,j . As f i is an (r, \u03bb)-immersion, we conclude with Lemma A.1 in the appendix that\nf 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ) in at most one point.\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma will be needed in order to show that the mappings \u03c6i are well-defined:\n\n19\n\n\f4.

Let S1 be the intersection point of f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) with f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ), and\nS2 the intersection point of f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) with f i (U\u03b4i1 ,k ). Finally let \u03c31 \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,j with f i (\u03c31 ) = S1 , and\n\u03c32 \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,k with f i (\u03c32 ) = S2 . Then \u03c31 = \u03c32 .\nProof:\nBy Lemma 4.1 we have S2 \u2208 f i (U\u03b4i2 ,k ), hence \u03c32 \u2208 U\u03b4i2 ,k . As p \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j \u2229 U\u03b413 ,k , we have in particular\nU\u03b412 ,j \u2229 U\u03b412 ,k 6= \u2205 and hence U\u03b412 ,k \u2282 U\u03b411 ,j by Lemma 2.8 b). By Lemma 4.1 the set f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) has\nexactly one point of intersection with f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ). We conclude \u03c31 = \u03c32 .\n\u0003\n\nNow we are able to define the mappings \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i . Let p \u2208 M 1 . Then p \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j for some j.\nThe line f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p) intersects f i (U\u03b4i1 ,j ) in exactly one point Sp . Moreover there is exactly one point\n\u03c3p \u2208 U\u03b4i1 ,j with f i (\u03c3p ) = Sp . We set \u03c6i (p) := \u03c3p . The mappings \u03c6i are well-defined by Lemma 4.2.\nClearly we have f i \u25e6 \u03c6i (p) = Sp .\nWe like to show that each \u03c6i is a diffeomorphism. For that we follow in parts the argumentation\nof [4]:\nLemma 4.3 Each of the mappings \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i is surjective.\nProof:\nLet q \u2208 M i . As Qi is a \u03b44 -net for f i , there is a j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} with q \u2208 U\u03b4i4 ,j . By Lemma 3.4, for \u03b5 =\n1\n\u03b5\n1\n1\n1\n1\nL cos \u03b3 the set F (Ej ) forms a tubular neighborhood around f (U\u03b43 ,j ), and moreover B\u03c3 (f (U\u03b44 ,j )) \u2282\n\u03b5\nFj (Ej ) with \u03c3 as in (3.8). With (3.9) and an estimation completely analogous to that in the proof of\nLemma 4.1, one shows f i (U\u03b4i4 ,j ) \u2282 B\u03c3 (f 1 (U\u03b414 ,j )). Hence, for every q \u2208 U\u03b4i4 ,j there is a p \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j with\nf i (q) \u2208 f 1 (p) + \u03c9(p). By the definition of \u03c6i this yields \u03c6i (p) = q.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4 Each of the mappings \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i is injective.\nProof:\nFirst we note that for every j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} we have \u03c6i (U\u03b415 ,j ) \u2282 U\u03b4i4 ,j . This is shown by the same argumentation as in Lemma 4.1. Moreover, by the proof of Lemma 4.3, we know that f i (U\u03b4i4 ,j ) \u2282 Fj (Ej\u03b5 ).\nUsing that Q1 is a \u03b45 -net for f 1 , we conclude f i \u25e6 \u03c6i (x) \u2208 Fj (\u00cax \u2229 Ej\u03b5 ) for every x \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j (where\n\u00cax = \u03c0\u0302 \u22121 (x)). As Fj |Ej\u03b5 is a diffeomorphism, we conclude that \u03c6i is injective on U\u03b413 ,j .\nFor showing global injectivity, let x, y \u2208 M 1 with x 6= y. As Q1 is a \u03b45 -net for f 1 , there are j, k\nwith x \u2208 U\u03b415 ,j \u2282 U\u03b414 ,j , y \u2208 U\u03b415 ,k \u2282 U\u03b414 ,k .\nCase 1: U\u03b414 ,j \u2229 U\u03b414 ,k = \u2205\nBy the considerations at the beginning of this proof, we have \u03c6i (x) \u2208 U\u03b4i4 ,j , \u03c6i (y) \u2208 U\u03b4i4 ,k . By\n(3.2) for \u03b9 = 4, we have U\u03b4i4 ,j \u2229 U\u03b4i4 ,k = \u2205. This implies \u03c6i (x) 6= \u03c6i (y).\nCase 2: U\u03b414 ,j \u2229 U\u03b414 ,k 6= \u2205\nBy Lemma 2.8 b) we have U\u03b414 ,k \u2282 U\u03b413 ,j . By the considerations of above, \u03c6i is injective on U\u03b413 ,j .\nAgain we conclude \u03c6i (x) 6= \u03c6i (y).\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.5 Each mapping \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i is a diffeomorphism.\n\n20\n\n\f4.

Using a trivialization of\nthe trivial bundle \u00caj , one easily concludes that f i \u25e6 \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 Rm+1 is an immersion (see also [4]).\nMoreover, the mapping \u03c6i is surjective by Lemma 4.3, and injective by Lemma 4.4. We conclude that\n\u03c6i is a diffeomorphism.\n\u0003\n\nFinally we would like to prove that the reparametrizations f i \u25e6 \u03c6i are uniformly Lipschitz bounded.\nAs above, for j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} we can consider f i \u25e6 \u03c6i |U\u03b413 ,j also as a mapping defined on B\u03b43 . This\nmapping shall be denoted by f\u02c6i : B\u03b43 \u2192 Rm+1 .\nLemma 4.6 Let j \u2208 {1, . . . , s}. Let f\u02c6i : B\u03b43 \u2192 Rm+1 be the local representation of f i \u25e6 \u03c6i |U\u03b413 ,j as\nexplained above. Then f\u02c6i is \u039b-Lipschitz for a finite constant \u039b = \u039b(\u03bb).\nProof:\nLet x, y \u2208 B\u03b43 .

We conclude\n\n|f\u02c6i (x) \u2212 f\u02c6i (y)|\n\n= |(\u03c0\u0303(f\u02c6i (x)), \u0169(\u03c0\u0303(f\u02c6i (x)))) \u2212 (\u03c0\u0303(f\u02c6i (y)), \u0169(\u03c0\u0303(f\u02c6i (y))))|\n\u2264 (1 + tan \u03b3)(1 + \u03bb + rL)|x \u2212 y|.\n\n(4.4)\n\nIf x, y \u2208 B\u03b43 are arbitrary points, let N \u2208 N with N > 1+\u03bb+rL\n|x \u2212 y|. We define x\u03b9 = x + \u03b9 y\u2212x\n\u033a\nN \u2208 B\u03b43\nfor \u03b9 = 0, . . . , N . Then, using a telescoping sum and (4.4), we have\n|f\u02c6i (x) \u2212 f\u02c6i (y)| \u2264\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n|f\u02c6i (x\u03b9 ) \u2212 f\u02c6i (x\u03b9+1 )|\n\n\u03b9=0\n\n\u2264\n\n(1 + tan \u03b3)(1 + \u03bb + rL)|x \u2212 y|.\n\n21\n\n\f5. The limit function lies in F0 (r, \u03bb)\nBy the definitions of L and \u03b3, the quantities rL and \u03b3 depend only on \u03bb.\n\u039b-Lipschitz with \u039b = \u039b(\u03bb) = (1 + tan \u03b3)(1 + \u03bb + rL).\n\nHence f\u02c6i is\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.7 If we choose some of the constants more carefully, we can give a better bound for \u039b\nin the preceding lemma. Choosing the right hand side in (3.4) extremely small, we can replace \u03b3 by\na number \u03b3\u0303 which is slightly greater than arctan \u03bb. Moreover, we can choose \u03b5 with |\u03bc1 |, |\u03bc2 | < \u03b5\nso small, that the term \u03b5L can almost be neglected. With these constants, we finally obtain \u039b =\n(1 + tan \u03b3\u0303)(1 + \u03bb + \u03b5L) < 2(1 + \u03bb)2 . In particular, \u039b does not depend on the dimension m here,\nalthough L depends on m.\nFinally, with Lemma 4.6, we may pass to a subsequence such that f i \u25e6 \u03c6i converges uniformly to a\nlimit function f : M 1 \u2192 Rm+1 . As limit manifold we define M := M 1 . Thus the limit manifold is a\ncompact differentiable m-manifold.\n\n5. The limit function lies in F0 (r, \u03bb)\nUp to this point we have found a subsequence and diffeomorphisms \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i , such that f i \u25e6 \u03c6i\nis uniformly Lipschitz bounded and converges uniformly to an f : M 1 \u2192 Rm+1 . In this section we\nwill show that the limit function f lies in F0 (r, \u03bb).\nFor that we have to show, that for each point q \u2208 M 1 there is an E = E(q) \u2208 Gm+1,m , such\nE\nE\nthat f is injective on Ur,q\nand the set A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f (Ur,q ) is the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function\nu : Br \u2192 R with Lipschitz constant \u03bb.\nSo let q \u2208 M 1 . Let q i = \u03c6i (q) \u2208 M i . As each f i is an (r, \u03bb)-immersion, there are E i \u2208 Gm+1,m\nEi\ni\nsuch that for each i the set (Aiqi ,E i )\u22121 \u25e6 f i (Ur,q\ni ) is the graph of a differentiable function u : Br \u2192 R\ni\nwith kDu kC 0 (Br ) \u2264 \u03bb.\nPassing to another subsequence, we may assume\nui\nEi\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\nu\nE\n\nuniformly,\nfor the metric d defined in (2.3)\n\nas i \u2192 \u221e, where u : Br \u2192 R and E \u2208 Gm+1,m . In particular, u is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz\nconstant \u03bb.\nLet Aq,E be a Euclidean isometry, which maps the origin to f (q), and the subspace Rm \u00d7{0} \u2282 Rm \u00d7R\nonto f (q) + E. Then we have in any case Aq,E ({(x, u(x)) : x \u2208 Br }) \u2282 f (M 1 ).\n\u22121\nE\nE\n\u25e6 f (Ur,q\n) is the graph of\nTo finish the proof, we show that f is injective on Ur,q\nand that Aq,E\nthe function u. This is true, if and only if for every \u033a with 0 < \u033a < r the function f is injective on\nE\nE\nU\u033a,q\nand the set A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f (U\u033a,q ) is the graph of the function u|B\u033a .\n\nWe first show the graph property. Let a \u033a with 0 < \u033a < r be given. Let \u03b5 > 0 with \u03b5 < min{\u033a, r \u2212 \u033a}.\ni\ni \u22121\nE\nMoreover, let U\u033ai \u2282 M 1 be the q-component of the set (\u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\n(B\u033a ). Again, U\u033a,q\n\u2282 M1\nqi ,E i \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6 )\n\u22121\ni\ni\ni\nis the q-component of (\u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\n(B\u033a ). By the definition of U\u033ai , we have A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f )\nqi ,E i \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6 (U\u033a ) =\n\u22121\n\u22121\ni\ni\ni\n{(x, u (x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a }. As Aqi ,E i \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2192 Aq,E \u25e6 f uniformly, we conclude with the definitions of U\u033ai\nE\ni\nE\ni\nand U\u033a,q\nthat U\u033a\u2212\u03b5\n\u2282 U\u033a,q\n\u2282 U\u033a+\u03b5\nfor i sufficiently large, in particular\ni\ni\nE\ni\n{(x, ui (x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a\u2212\u03b5 } \u2282 A\u22121\nqi ,E i \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6 (U\u033a,q ) \u2282 {(x, u (x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a+\u03b5 }.\n\nLetting i \u2192 \u221e, we obtain\nE\n{(x, u(x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a\u2212\u03b5 } \u2282 A\u22121\nq,E \u25e6 f (U\u033a,q ) \u2282 {(x, u(x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a+\u03b5 }.\n\n22\n\n\f6. Compactness in higher codimension\nE\nAs this is true for every \u03b5 > 0 with \u03b5 < min{\u033a, r \u2212 \u033a}, we conclude with the definition of U\u033a,q\nthat\n\u22121\nE\nAq,E \u25e6 f (U\u033a,q ) = {(x, u(x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a }. This is the desired graph property.\nE\nE\nSimilarly, one shows that f is injective on U\u033a,q\n. We have f (x) = limi\u2192\u221e f i \u25e6 \u03c6i (x) for all x \u2208 U\u033a,q\n,\nE\ni\ni\ni\ni\nand moreover U\u033a,q \u2282 U\u033a+\u03b5 for i sufficiently large.

Using Aq ,E \u2192 Aq,E , one easily concludes that\n\u22121\nE\nAq,E \u25e6 f and hence also f is injective on U\u033a,q .\n\nThis shows that the limit function f lies in F0 (r, \u03bb).\n\n6. Compactness in higher codimension\nIn the final section we want to prove Theorem 1.3, that is compactness of (r, \u03bb)-immersions in higher\ncodimension with \u03bb \u2264 14 . Our main task here is to give an analogous construction of the averaged\nnormal projection for arbitrary codimension. For that we shall use a Riemannian center of mass,\nwhich was introduced above.\nSo let f i be a sequence as in Theorem 1.3 with \u03bb \u2264 41 . For all objects of the preceding sections\nthat are defined also in arbitrary codimension, we shall use precisely the same notation. We note that\nLemmas 2.8 and 2.12 are true also in higher codimension. For q \u2208 M 1 we set\n\u0013\n\u0012 1\n|f (q) \u2212 f 1 (qj )|\n.\n\u03bbqj := g\n\u03b42\nAs in the proof of Lemma 3.1 a) we conclude that there is a k \u2208 Z(q) with \u03bbqk = 1. For each\nj \u2208 {1, . . . , s} let Nj \u2208 Gn,k be the k-space perpendicular to Ej . We define for each q \u2208 M 1 a\nprobability measure \u03bcq on Gn,k by\n\u03bcq =\n\nX\n\n\u03bbqj\n\nj\u2208Z(q)\n\n!\u22121\n\nX\n\n\u03bbqj \u03b4Nj ,\n\nj\u2208Z(q)\n\nwhere \u03b4N denotes the Dirac measure on Gn,k supported at N \u2208 Gn,k .\nMoreover, let\n\u03bd : M1\nq\n\n\u2192 Gn,k ,\n7\u2192 (Tq M 1 )\u22a5\n\nbe the normal map of f 1 as defined in (2.2), and \u03c4 : M 1 \u2192 Gn,m the corresponding tangent map as\nin (2.1). Now consider\n\u2192 R,\nZ\nP (p) =\n\nP : B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q))\n\nd(p, x)2 d\u03bcq (x),\n\nGn,k\n\nwhere B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q)) \u2282 Gn,k is the closed ball of radius \u03c06 around \u03bd(q). Here the radius is measured with\nrespect to the canonical distance d on Gn,k as defined in (2.3).\n\u03c0 (\u03bd(q)).\nLemma 6.1 For every q \u2208 M 1 it holds spt \u03bcq \u2282 B 12\n\nProof:\n\u03c0 (\u03bd(q)) for every j \u2208 Z(q).\nBy the definition of \u03bcq it is sufficient to show that Nj lies in B 12\nSo\n\n23\n\n\f6. Compactness in higher codimension\nlet j \u2208 Z(q). By the definition of Z(q) we have q \u2208 U\u03b412 ,j . We deduce that Nj is the graph of\nPk\n1\na linear function h over \u03bd(q) with kDhk = ( i=1 |\u2202i h|2 ) 2 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 41 . Let \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8k be the principal angles between Nj and \u03bd(q). After a suitable rotation we may assume that tan \u03b8i = |\u2202i h|\nPk\n1\nfor every i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Using \u03b8 \u2264 tan \u03b8 for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 ), we estimate d(Nj , \u03bd(q)) = ( i=1 \u03b8i2 ) 2 \u2264\nP\nPk\n1\n1\nk\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 (\u03bd(q)).\n. Hence Nj lies in B 12\n( i=1 (tan \u03b8i )2 ) 2 = ( i=1 |\u2202i h|2 ) 2 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 14 < 12\n\u0003\nIn particular we have spt \u03bcq \u2282 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q)). Hence we conclude with Lemma 2.4 and Theorem 2.6,\nthat there is exactly one center of mass N (q) \u2208 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q)) \u2282 Gn,k for \u03bcq . In this way we may define a\nmapping\nN : M1\n\n\u2192 Gn,k ,\n\nq\n\n7\u2192 N (q).\n\nAn important property of the averaged normal N constructed in this way is its differentiability. It is\nneeded in order to obtain diffeomorphisms \u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i . We will show that N is in C k if the function\nf 1 is in C k (here we denote by k the degree of differentiability, and by k the codimension). First, for\nfunctions defined on manifolds, we need the following variation of the implicit function theorem:\nLemma 6.2 Let M be a smooth m-manifold, (N, g) a smooth Riemannian n-manifold and f :\nM \u00d7 N \u2192 R a mapping. For every fixed x \u2208 M , assume that\nhx : N \u2192 R,\n\nhx = f (x, * )\n\n2\n\nis in C (N ) and is strictly convex. Let k \u2265 1 be an integer. Denoting by grad hx the gradient of the\nfixed function hx defined above, assume that\nH : M \u00d7 N \u2192 T N,\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 grad hx (y)\n\nk\n\nis in C (M \u00d7 N, T N ). Let (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 M \u00d7 N be a point with H(x0 , y0 ) = 0 \u2208 Ty0 N .\nThen there are open neighborhoods U \u2282 M of x0 and V \u2282 N of y0 , and moreover a function\nF \u2208 C k (U, V ), such that {(x, y) \u2208 U \u00d7 V : H(x, y) = 0 \u2208 Ty N } = {(x, F (x)) : x \u2208 U }.\nProof:\nLet \u03c61 : U1 \u2192 \u03c6(U1 ) be a coordinate chart of M with x0 \u2208 U1 , and let \u03c62 : V1 \u2192 \u03c62 (V1 ) a coordinate\nchart of N with y0 \u2208 V1 . For fixed x \u2208 M , in the local coordinates \u03c62 we have\ngrad hx =\n\nn\nX\n\ng ij \u2202j hx \u2202i ,\n\n(6.1)\n\ni,j=1\n\nP\nand, with the corresponding Christoffel symbols \u0393kij = 12 nl=1 g kl (\u2202i gjl +\u2202j gil \u2212\u2202l gij ), the components\nP\nn\n2\nof the Hessian Dij\nhx = \u2202i \u2202j hx \u2212 k=1 \u0393kij \u2202k hx . If we assume \u03c62 to be Riemannian normal coordinates\ncentered in y0 , we obtain\n2\nDij\nhx (y0 ) = \u2202i \u2202j hx (y0 ).\n\n(6.2)\n\nLet us now consider the local representations of hx and f in the coordinates \u03c62 and \u03c61 \u00d7\u03c62 respectively.\nWe denote these representations simply by hx and f again. Moreover, we identify x0 and y0 with\n\u03c61 (x0 ) and \u03c62 (y0 ) respectively. The condition on hx to be strictly convex means that the Hessian\nD2 hx is positive definite in every point. Hence, by (6.2), the Hessian matrix D2 hx (y0 ) of the local\nrepresentation is positive definite, in particular\nD2 hx0 (y0 )\n\nis invertible.\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe Jacobian Df may be considered as a mapping Df : \u03a9 \u2192 Rm+n , where \u03a9 = \u03c61 (U1 ) \u00d7 \u03c62 (V1 )\n\u2282 Rm \u00d7 Rn . We write Df = (Dx f, Dy f ) \u2208 Rm \u00d7 Rn and consider the mapping Dy f : \u03a9 \u2192 Rn .\n\n24\n\n\f6. Compactness in higher codimension\nSimilarly, for the Jacobian of Dy f , we write D(Dy f ) = (Dx (Dy f ), Dy (Dy f )) \u2208 Rn\u00d7m \u00d7 Rn\u00d7n . As\nDy f (x0 , y0 ) = Dhx0 (y0 ) and as H(x0 , y0 ) = 0, we conclude\nDy f (x0 , y0 ) = 0.\n\n(6.4)\n\nSimilarly, as Dy (Dy f )(x0 , y0 ) = D2 hx0 (y0 ), we know by (6.3) that\nDy (Dy f )(x0 , y0 )\n\nis invertible.\n\n(6.5)\n\nThe assumption on H to be in C k implies with (6.1) that also Dy f : \u03a9 \u2192 Rn is in C k . Hence we\nmay use (6.4), (6.5) and apply the usual implicit function theorem to the function Dy f . From this we\ndeduce the statement.\n\u0003\nUsing the preceding lemma, we are able to deduce that the mapping N is differentiable:\nLemma 6.3 Let N : M 1 \u2192 Gn,k be the averaged normal corresponding to f 1 : M 1 \u2192 Rn , as\nconstructed above. Assume that f 1 \u2208 C k (M 1 , Rn ) for a k \u2265 1. Then N \u2208 C k (M 1 , Gn,k ).\nProof:\nLet q0 \u2208 M 1 be a point. We show that N is C k in a neighborhood of q0 . Let W \u2282 M 1 be an open\n\u03c0 (\u03bd(q )). With Lemma 6.1 we have spt \u03bc \u2282 B \u03c0 (\u03bd(q )) for every\nneighborhood of q0 with \u03bd(W ) \u2282 B 12\nq\n0\n0\n6\nq \u2208 W ; this will be implicitly used in the following argumentation. Let\nG : W \u00d7 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) \u2192\n\nR,\nZ\n\n(q, p) 7\u2192\n\nd(p, x)2 d\u03bcq (x).\n\nGn,k\n\nMoreover, for fixed q \u2208 W let hq : B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) \u2192 R, hq := G(q, * ). By this definition, hq is smooth\non B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) and by Theorem 2.6 strictly convex. We denote by grad hq the gradient of the fixed\nfunction hq , and define\nH : W \u00d7 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) \u2192 T B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )),\n\n(q, p) 7\u2192 grad hq (p).\n\nWith (2.5) and the definition of \u03bcq , we calculate\nH(q, p) = \u22122\n\nX\n\nj\u2208Z(q)\n\nAs \u03bbqj = g\n\n\u0010\n\n|f 1 (q)\u2212f 1 (qj )|\n\u03b42\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03bbqj\n\n!\u22121\n\nX\n\n\u03bbqj exp\u22121\np (Nj ).\n\n(6.6)\n\nj\u2208Z(q)\n\nand by the definition of g, the mapping q 7\u2192 \u03bbqj is in C k if f is in C k .\n\nk\nMoreover, as for every j \u2208 Z(q) the mapping p 7\u2192 exp\u22121\np (Nj ) is smooth, we conclude that H is in C .\nk\nNote that g is smooth with g(1) = 0, hence H is C even if the sums in (6.6) depend on Z(q).\n\nAs N (q) \u2208 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) is the center of mass for \u03bcq , we have H(q, N (q)) = 0 for every q \u2208 W , in\nparticular H(q0 , N (q0 )) = 0.\nNow we are in a position to apply Lemma 6.2. We conclude that there are open neighborhoods\nU \u2282 W of q0 , V \u2282 B \u03c06 (\u03bd(q0 )) of N (q0 ), and a function F \u2208 C k (U, V ) with {(x, y) \u2208 U \u00d7 V : H(x, y) =\n0} = {(x, F (x)) : x \u2208 U }. With Theorem 2.6 we deduce, that N coincides with F on U . Hence N is\nin C k on U .\n\u0003\nRemark 6.4 In particular, the preceding lemma shows that the averaged normal N can be used for\nthe projection in the case of immersions with Lp -bounded second fundamental form, which was the\ncase considered in [4]. For an (r, \u03bb)-immersion f \u2208 C k , the normal \u03bdf is in C k\u22121 , while the averaged\n\n25\n\n\f6. Compactness in higher codimension\nnormal N is in C k . In particular, the averaged normal of a C 1 -immersion is differentiable and forms\nlocally a tubular neighborhood around the immersion. Thus it is possible to construct diffeomorphisms\n\u03c6i : M 1 \u2192 M i using the averaged normal. However, if one likes to show convergence as in [14] and\nin [4], we require N even to be in C 2 . For that purpose, an additional smoothing of f is unavoidable;\nthis was also performed by Langer (see the first paragraph on p. 229 in [14], where a C 1 -perturbation\nis made in order to smooth the immersion). On the other hand, a pure smoothing argument would\nnot suffice to prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.3. As in general the limit is not even differentiable, one has\nto project from f i0 (M i0 ) for a fixed and sufficiently large i0 . The averaged normal is needed then in\norder to estimate the size of the tubular neighborhood.\nAs in the case of codimension 1, we may consider the restriction of N to U\u03b413 ,j as a mapping defined\non B\u03b43 . As an analogue of Lemma 3.2 we show the following statement:\nLemma 6.5 If we consider Gn,k as a metric space with the geodesic distance d, the mapping N :\nB\u03b43 \u2192 Gn,k is L-Lipschitz with L = 412m+6 r\u22121 .\nProof:\n\u22121\n1\n1\nLet x, y \u2208 B\u03b43 . Then there are unique p, q \u2208 U\u03b413 ,j with \u03c0 \u25e6 A\u22121\nj \u25e6 f (p) = x, \u03c0 \u25e6 Aj \u25e6 f (q) = y. With\np\nthe argumentation at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 3.2, one shows \u03bbj = 0 for j \u2208 Z(q) \\ Z(p)\nand \u03bbqj = 0 for j \u2208 Z(p) \\ Z(q).

With a calculation as in Lemma 6.1 we deduce Nk \u2208 B 12\n\u03c0 (\u03bd(q)). This enables us to apply Lemma 2.7 with \u03bc\nspt \u03bcp and spt \u03bcq are a subset of B 12\n1 = \u03bcp and\n\u03bc2 = \u03bcq .\nWith Lemma 2.7, the definitions of \u03bcp and \u03bcq , and (6.9) we estimate\nZ\nd(N (q), z) d|\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcq |(z)\nd(N (x), N (y)) \u2264 C\nGn,k\n\n=\n\nC\n\nX\n\nd(N (q), Nj )\n\nC * 10 * 4\n\n6m+2\n\nX\n\nd(N (q), Nj ) r\n\nj\u2208Z(p)\u222aZ(q)\n\n\u2264\n\n\u03bbpk\n\nk\u2208Z(p)\n\nj\u2208Z(p)\u222aZ(q)\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\n412m+6 r\u22121 |x \u2212 y|,\n\n26\n\n!\u22121\n\n\u03bbpj\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\n|x \u2212 y|\n\nX\n\nk\u2208Z(q)\n\n\u03bbqk\n\n!\u22121\n\n\u03bbqj\n\n\fA. Size of tubular neighborhoods\nwhere in the last line we used d(N (q), Nj ) < \u03c06 , |Z(p) \u222a Z(q)| \u2264 2 * 46m and C\n1 + (\u03ba1/2 \u033a)\u22121 tan(2\u03ba 1/2 \u033a) < 16 for \u03ba = 2 and \u033a = \u03c06 by (2.4).\n\n=\n\u0003\n\nNow the rest of the proof is analogous to the case of codimension 1. First we note that with the\npreceding lemma one easily derives an estimate for the size of the tubular neighborhood around f 1\nformed by N . This is done by using elementary geometry in much the same way as in the appendix\n(where the case of codimension 1 is considered); as we assumed \u03bb to be small and hence N nearly to be\nperpendicular to f 1 , it is even easier here as we can estimate rather roughly (and do not need an analogue of Lemma 3.1 b) for that). Moreover, we can show the existence and uniqueness of intersection\npoints of f 1 (p)+ N (p) with an appropriate restriction of f i (M i ) by the fixed point argument of [4]. To\nshow surjectivity of \u03c6i one uses the estimate for the size of the tubular neighborhood and shows that\nf i (M i ) lies within this neighborhood. The rest of the proof is the same as in the case of codimension 1.\nThe question arises, whether compactness in higher codimension, that is Theorem 1.3, can also be\nshown for an arbitrary Lipschitz constant \u03bb (as in the case of codimension 1). Surely, the bound\n\u03bb \u2264 14 is not optimal. One could try to find the largest possible bound for \u03bb, and - in the case that\nit is finite - to give a counterexample for immersions exceeding this bound. We would like to suggest\ntwo possibilities for extending the construction in this section to immersions with Lipschitz constant\nlarger than the ones considered here: First, as proposed in the remark on p. 511 in [13], one could\nuse another definition for the center of mass, which allows one to define centers in larger balls. The\nsecond is to find a center of mass not in a convex ball, but in a larger convex subset of Gn,k . Such\nkind of subsets of Grassmannians have been detected by J. Jost and Y.L. Xin in [12].\n\nA. Size of tubular neighborhoods\nIn this appendix we like to prove Lemma 2.15, that is we estimate the size of a tubular neighborhood\naround a graph depending on different quantities such as angles and Lipschitz constants. We shall\nuse the notations introduced in the paragraph preceding Lemma 2.15. For a general treatise on the\nexistence of tubular neighborhoods see [5] and [10]. Moreover, in Lemma A.1 we will show a result\nneeded for proving that the projection in Section 4 has at most one point of intersection with an\nappropriate subset of f i (M i ).\nProof of Lemma 2.15:\na) We like to start with the following initial consideration:\nLet q \u2208 B\u033a . Let f (x) = (x, u(x)) and \u03c4f (q) \u2208 Gm+1,m be the tangent space at q as in (2.1). In\nparticular \u03c4f (q) is an m-space in Rm+1 perpendicular to \u03bd(q). Furthermore let K \u2282 \u03c4f (q) be a\n1-dimensional subspace of \u03c4f (q). Let p \u2208 B\u033a and let \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c02 be the smaller angle enclosed by the\nlines \u03c9(p) and K. From (2.11) we deduce\n\u03c0\n\u2212 \u03b3 > 0.\n(A.1)\n\u03b1 \u2265\n2\nNow let us come to the main part of the proof:\nLet x, y \u2208 B\u033a with x 6= y. Without loss of generality we may assume x \u2212 y \u2208 R1 \u00d7 {0}\n\u2282 Rm . By the mean value theorem there is a z \u2208 {(1 \u2212 t)x + ty : t \u2208 (0, 1)} \u2282 B\u033a with\n\u22021 u(z) =\n\nu(x) \u2212 u(y)\n,\nx1 \u2212 y1\n\nwhere x1 , y1 are the first coordinate of the vectors x, y respectively. Let {e1 , . . . , em } be the\nstandard basis of Rm . We set\nK := span {(e1 , \u22021 u(z))} \u2282 \u03c4f (z).\n\n27\n\n\fA. Size of tubular neighborhoods\nLet \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c02 be the smaller angle enclosed by the lines \u03c9(y) and K. By (A.1) we have \u03b1 \u2265 \u03c02 \u2212\u03b3. In\nparticular the smaller angle between \u03c9(y) and the line through (x, u(x)) and (y, u(y)) is greater\nthan or equal to \u03c02 \u2212 \u03b3 (see Figure A.1).\n(y, u(y)) + \u03c9(y)\n\n\u270e\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03c0 \u22a5 ((x, u(x)))\n\nan angle \u2265\n\u2022\n\n\u03b1\n(\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\n{(x, u(x)) : x \u2208 B\u033a \u2229 (R1 \u00d7 {0})}\n\n\u261b\n\n|\n\n\u2022\n|\n\nx\n\ny\n\n) B \u2229 (R1 \u00d7 {0})\n\u033a\n\n\u2666\nline through (x, u(x)) and (y, u(y))\n\nFigure A.1 Calculation of the distance between (x, u(x)) and \u03c0 \u22a5 ((x, u(x))).
