Introduction\nThe first circle of results of this paper are motivated by the classical theorems of Lichnerowicz [32] and\nObata [36] giving correspondingly a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a compact\nmanifold with a Ricci bound and characterizing the case of equality. In fact, in [32] it was shown that for\nevery compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n for which the Ricci curvature is greater than or equal\nto that of the round unit n-dimensional sphere S n (1), i.e.,\nRic(X, Y ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1)g(X, Y )\nwe have that the first positive eigenvalue \u03bb1 of the (positive) Laplace operator is greater than or equal to\nthe first eigenvalue of the sphere,\n\u03bb1 \u2265 n.\nDate: June 18, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C26, 53C25, 58J60.\nKey words and phrases. quaternionic contact structures, qc conformal flatness, qc conformal curvature, Einstein metrics.\nThis work has been ratially funded by.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. IVANOV, A. PETKOV, AND D. VASSILEV\n\nSubsequently in [36] it was shown that the lower bound for the eigenvalue is achieved iff the Riemannian\nmanifold is isometric to S n (1). Lichnerowicz proved his result using the classical Bochner-Weitzenb\u00f6ck\nformula. In turn, Obata showed that under these assumptions the eigenfunction \u03c6 satisfies the system\n\u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c6g, after which he defines an isometry using analysis based on the geodesics and Hessian comparison\nof the distance function from a point. Later Gallot [20] generalized these results to statements involving the\nhigher eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator.\nIt is natural to ask if there is a sub-Riemannian version of the above results. Greenleaf [23] gave a version\nof Lichnerowicz' result on a compact strongly pseudo-convex CR manifold. Suppose M is 2n + 1, n \u2265 3\ndimensional strongly pseudo-convex CR manifold. If\nRic(X, Y ) + 4A(X, JY ) \u2265 (n + 1)g(X, X)\nfor all horizontal vectors X, where Ric and A are, correspondingly, the Ricci curvature and the Webster\ntorsion of the Tanaka-Webster connection (in the notation from [30, 29]), then the first positive eigenvalue\n\u03bb1 of the sub-Laplacian satisfies the inequality \u03bb1 \u2265 n. The standard CR structure on the sphere achieves\nequality in this inequality. Further results in the CR case have been proved in [33], [14], [11, 10, 9], [3] and\n[12] adding a corresponding inequality for n = 1, or characterizing the equality case in the vanishing torsion\ncase (the Sasakian case).\nOne purpose of this paper is to consider these questions in the setting of a closed compact quaternionic\ncontact manifold. The Lichnerowicz type result is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let (M, g, Q) be a compact quaternionic contact manifold of dimension 4n + 3 > 7. If the\nRicci tensor and torsion of the Biquard connection satisfy the inequality\n(1.1)\n\nRic(X, X) +\n\n2(4n + 5) 0\n3(2n2 + 5n \u2212 1)\nT (X, X) +\nU (X, X) \u2265 k0 g(X, X)\n2n + 1\n(n \u2212 1)(2n + 1)\n\nfor some positive constant k0 then any positive eigenvalue \u03bb of the sub-Laplacian \u25b3 satisfies the inequality\nn\nk0 .\n\u03bb\u2265\nn+2\nThe second goal then is to investigate the case of equality in Theorem 1.1. We restrict our considerations\nto the case when the torsion of the Biquard connection vanishes, T 0 = U = 0. In this case it is known [24]\nthat the qc manifold is qc-Einstein, Ric = k.g, the qc-scalar curvature is constant (n > 1) and if it is positive\nthen the qc manifold is locally qc equivalent to a 3-Sasakian space. The corresponding result in the negative\nscalar curvature case can be found in [28] and [29]. We prove the following result.\nTheorem 1.2. Let (M, g, Q) be a compact qc-Einstein manifold of dimension 4n + 3 > 7 of qc scalar\ncurvature Scal = 16n(n + 2),\n1\nScalg(X, Y ) = 4(n + 2)g(X, Y ).\n4n\nThe first positive eigenvalue \u03bb1 of the sub-Laplacian equals 4n if and only if (M, g, Q) is qc equivalent to the\n3-Sasakian sphere of dimension 4n + 3.\nIn particular, on a 3-Sasakian manifold of dimension (4n+3), n > 1, the first positive eigenvalue of the\nsub-laplacian is equal to 4n if and only if the 3-Sasakian manifold is qc-equivalent to the 3-Sasakian sphere.\nRic(X, Y ) =\n\nWe note that in [26] is given an explicit formula for the eigenfunctions of the above eigenvalue, see also\n[1].\nThe second main theme of the paper is the derivation of an a-priori inequality between the (horizontal)\nHessian and sub-Laplacian. For the Heisenberg group a corresponding sharp estimate was found in [17].\nEquipped with our estimate we precise the scope of use of [16] for the quaternionic Heisenberg group. We\nrecall that the main application is the establishment of the C1,\u03b1 regularity for the p sub-Laplacian with p\nclose to 2. The exact interval for p around 2 is determined by the constant found in this paper. Using\nBochner's identity we will find an integral identity. Such integral identities have been exploited earlier in [21]\nin the setting of Carnot groups. A similar method based on Greenleaf's formula was employed in [13], but\n\n\fTHE SHARP LOWER BOUND OF THE FIRST EIGENVALUE\n\n3\n\ndue to the different quaternionic linear algebra our proof proceeds in a way particular to the quaternionic\ncase. Here we prove the following result.\nTheorem 1.3. Let (M, \u03b7) be a (4n + 3)-dimensional qc manifold, n > 1.

Quaternionic contact manifolds\nIn this section we will briefly review the basic notions of quaternionic contact geometry and recall some\nresults from [4], [24] and [27] which we will use in this paper.\n2.1. Quaternionic contact structures and the Biquard connection. A quaternionic contact (qc)\nmanifold (M, g, Q) is a 4n + 3-dimensional manifold M with a codimension three distribution H locally given\nas the kernel of a 1-form \u03b7 = (\u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73 ) with values in R3 . In addition H has an Sp(n)Sp(1) structure, that\nis, it is equipped with a Riemannian metric g and a rank-three bundle Q consisting of endomorphisms of H\nlocally generated by three almost complex structures I1 , I2 , I3 on H satisfying the identities of the imaginary\nunit quaternions, I1 I2 = \u2212I2 I1 = I3 , I1 I2 I3 = \u2212id|H which are hermitian compatible with the metric\ng(Is ., Is .) = g(., .) and the following compatibility condition holds\n2g(Is X, Y ) = d\u03b7s (X, Y ), X, Y \u2208 H.\nA special phenomena, noted in [4], is that the contact form \u03b7 determines the quaternionic structure and\nthe metric on the horizontal distribution in a unique way.\nIf the first Pontryagin class of M vanishes then the 2-sphere bundle of R3 -valued 1-forms is trivial [2], i.e.\nthere is a globally defined form \u03b7 that anihilates H, we denote the corresponding qc manifold (M, \u03b7). In this\ncase the 2-sphere of associated almost complex structures is also globally defined on H.\nOn a qc manifold with a fixed metric g on H there exists a canonical connection defined in [4] when the\ndimension (4n + 3) > 7, and in [18] for the 7-dimensional case.\nTheorem 2.1. .[4] Let (M, g, Q) be a qc manifold of dimension 4n + 3 > 7 and a fixed metric g on H in\nthe conformal class [g]. Then there exists a unique connection \u2207 with torsion T on M 4n+3 and a unique\nsupplementary subspace V to H in T M , such that:\ni) \u2207 preserves the decomposition H \u2295 V and the Sp(n)Sp(1) structure on H, i.e. \u2207g = 0, \u2207\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(Q)\nfor a section \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(Q), and its torsion on H is given by T (X, Y ) = \u2212[X, Y ]|V ;\n\n\f4\n\nS. IVANOV, A. PETKOV, AND D. VASSILEV\n\nii) for \u03be \u2208 V , the endomorphism T (\u03be, .)|H of H lies in (sp(n) \u2295 sp(1))\u22a5 \u2282 gl(4n);\niii) the connection on V is induced by the natural identification \u03c6 of V with the subspace sp(1) of the\nendomorphisms of H, i.e. \u2207\u03c6 = 0.\nP4n\nIn ii), the inner product <, > of End(H) is given by < A, B >= i=1 g(A(ei ), B(ei )), for A, B \u2208 End(H).\nWe shall call the above connection the Biquard connection. When the dimension of M is at least eleven [4]\nalso described the supplementary distribution V , which is (locally) generated by the so called Reeb vector\nfields {\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 } determined by\n(2.1)\n\n\u03b7s (\u03bek ) = \u03b4sk ,\n\n(\u03bes yd\u03b7s )|H = 0,\n\n(\u03bes yd\u03b7k )|H = \u2212(\u03bek yd\u03b7s )|H ,\n\nwhere y denotes the interior multiplication. If the dimension of M is seven Duchemin shows in [18] that if\nwe assume, in addition, the existence of Reeb vector fields as in (2.1), then Theorem 2.1 holds. Henceforth,\nby a qc structure in dimension 7 we shall mean a qc structure satisfying (2.1).\nThe qc conformal curvature tensor W qc , introduced in [27], is the obstruction for a qc structure to be\nlocally qc conformal to the flat structure on the quaternionic Heisenberg group G (H). A qc conformally\nflat structure is also locally qc conformal to the standard 3-Sasaki sphere due to the local qc conformal\nequivalence of the standard 3-Sasakian structure on the (4n + 3)-dimensional sphere and the quaternionic\nHeisenberg group [24, 27].\nNotice that equations (2.1) are invariant under the natural SO(3) action. Using the triple of Reeb vector\nfields we extend g to a metric on M by requiring span{\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 } = V \u22a5 H and g(\u03bes , \u03bek ) = \u03b4sk . The\nextended metric does not depend on the action of SO(3) on V , but it changes in an obvious manner if\n\u03b7 is multiplied by a conformal factor. Clearly, the Biquard connection preserves the extended metric on\nT M, \u2207g = 0. Since the Biquard connection is metric it is connected with the Levi-Civita connection \u2207g of\nthe metric g by the general formula\ni\n1h\n(2.2)\ng(\u2207A B, C) = g(\u2207gA B, C) + g(T (A, B), C) \u2212 g(T (B, C), A) + g(T (C, A), B) .\n2\nThe covariant derivative of the qc structure with respect to the Biquard connection and the covariant\nderivative of the distribution V are given by\n(2.3)\n\n\u2207Ii = \u2212\u03b1j \u2297 Ik + \u03b1k \u2297 Ij ,\n\n\u2207\u03bei = \u2212\u03b1j \u2297 \u03bek + \u03b1k \u2297 \u03bej .\n\nThe sp(1)-connection 1-forms \u03b1s on H are expressed in [4] by\n(2.4)\n\n\u03b1i (X) = d\u03b7k (\u03bej , X) = \u2212d\u03b7j (\u03bek , X),\n\nX \u2208 H,\n\n\u03bei \u2208 V,\n\nwhile the sp(1)-connection 1-forms \u03b1s on the vertical space V are calculated in [24]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nS\n1\n\u03b1i (\u03bes ) = d\u03b7s (\u03bej , \u03bek ) \u2212 \u03b4is\n(2.5)\n+\n( d\u03b71 (\u03be2 , \u03be3 ) + d\u03b72 (\u03be3 , \u03be1 ) + d\u03b73 (\u03be1 , \u03be2 )) ,\n2\n2\nwhere S is the normalized qc scalar curvature defined below in (2.11). The vanishing of the sp(1)-connection\n1-forms on H implies the vanishing of the torsion endomorphism of the Biquard connection (see [24]).\nThe fundamental 2-forms \u03c9s of the quaternionic structure Q are defined by\n(2.6)\n\n2\u03c9s|H = d\u03b7s|H ,\n\n\u03bey\u03c9s = 0,\n\n\u03be \u2208 V.\n\nDue to (2.6), the torsion restricted to H has the form\n(2.7)\n\nT (X, Y ) = \u2212[X, Y ]|V = 2\u03c91 (X, Y )\u03be1 + 2\u03c92 (X, Y )\u03be2 + 2\u03c93 (X, Y )\u03be3 .\n\n2.2. Invariant decompositions.

If n = 1 then the space of symmetric endomorphisms commuting with all Is is 1-dimensional, i.e. the [3]-component of any symmetric endomorphism\n2\n\u03a8 on H is proportional to the identity, \u03a83 = |\u03a8|\n4 Id|H . Note here that each of the three 2-forms \u03c9s belongs\nto its [-1]-component, \u03c9s = \u03c9s[\u22121] and constitute a basis of the lie algebra sp(1).\n2.3. The torsion tensor. The properties of the Biquard connection are encoded in the properties of the\ntorsion endomorphism T\u03be = T (\u03be, *) : H \u2192 H, \u03be \u2208 V . Decomposing the endomorphism T\u03be \u2208 (sp(n) +\nsp(1))\u22a5 into its symmetric part T\u03be0 and skew-symmetric part b\u03be , T\u03be = T\u03be0 + b\u03be , O. Biquard shows in [4] that\nthe torsion T\u03be is completely trace-free, tr T\u03be = tr T\u03be \u25e6 Is = 0, its symmetric part has the properties T\u03be0i Ii =\n\u2212Ii T\u03be0i I2 (T\u03be02 )+\u2212\u2212 = I1 (T\u03be01 )\u2212+\u2212 , I3 (T\u03be03 )\u2212+\u2212 = I2 (T\u03be02 )\u2212\u2212+ , I1 (T\u03be01 )\u2212\u2212+ = I3 (T\u03be03 )+\u2212\u2212 , where the\nupperscript + + + means commuting with all three Ii , + \u2212 \u2212 indicates commuting with I1 and anticommuting with the other two and etc. The skew-symmetric part can be represented as b\u03bei = Ii u, where u is\na traceless symmetric (1,1)-tensor on H which commutes with I1 , I2 , I3 . If n = 1 then the tensor u vanishes\nidentically, u = 0 and the torsion is a symmetric tensor, T\u03be = T\u03be0 .\nAny 3-Sasakian manifold has zero torsion endomorphism, and the converse is true if in addition the qc\nscalar curvature (see (2.11)) is a positive constant [24]. We remind that a (4n + 3)-dimensional Riemannian\nmanifold (M, g) is called 3-Sasakian if the cone metric gc = t2 g + dt2 on C = M \u00d7 R+ is a hyper K\u00e4hler\nmetric, namely, it has holonomy contained in Sp(n + 1) [6]. A 3-Sasakian manifold of dimension (4n + 3) is\nEinstein with positive Riemannian scalar curvature (4n + 2)(4n + 3) [31] and if complete it is compact with\na finite fundamental group, (see [5] for a nice overview of 3-Sasakian spaces).\n2.4. Torsion and curvature. Let R = [\u2207, \u2207] \u2212 \u2207[ , ] be the curvature tensor of \u2207 and the dimension is\n4n + 3. We denote the curvature tensor of type (0,4) and the torsion tensor of type (0,3) by the same letter,\nR(A, B, C, D) := g(R(A, B)C, D), T (A, B, C) := g(T (A, B), C), A, B, C, D \u2208 \u0393(T M ). The Ricci tensor,\nthe normalized scalar curvature and the Ricci 2-forms of the Biquard connection, called qc-Ricci tensor Ric,\nnormalized qc-scalar curvature S and qc-Ricci forms \u03c1s , \u03c4s , respectively, are defined by\nRic(A, B) = R(eb , A, B, eb ), 8n(n + 2)S = R(eb , ea , ea , eb ),\n1\n1\n\u03c1s (A, B) =\nR(A, B, ea , Is ea ), \u03c4s (A, B) =\nR(ea , Is ea , A, B, ).\n4n\n4n\nThe sp(1)-part of R is determined by the Ricci 2-forms and the connection 1-forms by\n\n(2.11)\n\n(2.12)\n\nR(A, B, \u03bei , \u03bej ) = 2\u03c1k (A, B) = (d\u03b1k + \u03b1i \u2227 \u03b1j )(A, B),\n\nA, B \u2208 \u0393(T M ).\n\nThe two Sp(n)Sp(1)-invariant trace-free symmetric 2-tensors T 0 (X, Y ) = g((T\u03be01 I1 + T\u03be02 I2 + T\u03be03 I3 )X, Y ),\nU (X, Y ) = g(uX, Y ) on H, introduced in [24], have the properties:\n(2.13)\n\nT 0 (X, Y ) + T 0 (I1 X, I1 Y ) + T 0 (I2 X, I2 Y ) + T 0 (I3 X, I3 Y ) = 0,\nU (X, Y ) = U (I1 X, I1 Y ) = U (I2 X, I2 Y ) = U (I3 X, I3 Y ).\n\nIn dimension seven (n = 1), the tensor U vanishes identically, U = 0.\nWe shall need the following identity taken from [27, Proposition 2.3]\n(2.14)\n\n4T 0 (\u03bes , Is X, Y ) = T 0 (X, Y ) \u2212 T 0 (Is X, Is Y ).\n\n\f6\n\nS.

A qc structure is said to be qc Einstein if the horizontal qc-Ricci tensor is a scalar multiple\nof the metric,\nRic(X, Y ) = 2(n + 2)Sg(X, Y ).\nThe horizontal Ricci tensor and the horizontal Ricci 2-forms can be expressed in terms of the torsion\nof the Biquard connection [24] (see also [25, 27]). We collect the necessary facts from [24, Theorem 1.3,\nTheorem 3.12, Corollary 3.14, Proposition 4.3 and Proposition 4.4] with slight modification presented in [27]\nTheorem 2.3 ([24]). On a (4n + 3)-dimensional qc manifold (M, \u03b7, Q) with a normalized scalar curvature\nS we have the following relations\n\n(2.16)\n\nRic(X, Y ) = (2n + 2)T 0 (X, Y ) + (4n + 10)U (X, Y ) + 2(n + 2)Sg(X, Y ),\ni\n1h\n\u03c1s (X, Is Y ) = \u2212 T 0 (X, Y ) + T 0 (Is X, Is Y ) \u2212 2U (X, Y ) \u2212 Sg(X, Y ),\n2\ni\nn + 2h 0\n\u03c4s (X, Is Y ) = \u2212\nT (X, Y ) + T 0 (Is X, Is Y ) \u2212 Sg(X, Y ),\n2n\nT (\u03bei , \u03bej ) = \u2212S\u03bek \u2212 [\u03bei , \u03bej ]H ,\nS = \u2212g(T (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ), \u03be3 ),\n\ng(T (\u03bei , \u03bej ), X) = \u2212\u03c1k (Ii X, \u03bei ) = \u2212\u03c1k (Ij X, \u03bej ) = \u2212g([\u03bei , \u03bej ], X),\n1\n\u03bej (S) = \u03c1i (\u03bei , \u03bej ) + \u03c1k (\u03bek , \u03bej ),\n2\nX(S) 1\n+ (\u03c1i (\u03bej , Ik X) \u2212 \u03c1j (\u03bek , Ii X) \u2212 \u03c1k (\u03bei , Ij X)) .\n\u03c1i (\u03bei , X) =\n4\n2\nFor n = 1 the above formulas hold with U = 0.\nThe qc Einstein condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the torsion endomorphism of the Biquard\nconnection. In this case S is constant and the vertical distribution is integrale provided n > 1.\n2.5. The Ricci identities. We shall use repeatedly the following Ricci identities of order two and three,\nsee also [27]. Let \u03bei , i = 1, 2, 3 be the Reeb vector fields, X, Y \u2208 H and f a smooth function on the qc\nmanifold M with \u2207f its horizontal gradient of f , g(\u2207f, X) = df (X).

The horizontal divergence theorem. Let (M, g, Q) be a qc manifold of dimension 4n + 3 > 7 For\na fixed local 1-form \u03b7 and a fix s \u2208 {1, 2, 3} the form\n(2.18)\n\nV ol\u03b7 = \u03b71 \u2227 \u03b72 \u2227 \u03b73 \u2227 \u03c9s2n\n\nis a locally defined volume form. Note that V ol\u03b7 is independent on s as well as it is independent on the local\none forms \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73 . Hence it is globally defined volume form denoted with V ol\u03b7 .\nWe consider the (horizontal) divergence of a horizontal vector field/one-form \u03c3 \u2208 \u039b1 (H) defined by\n(2.19)\n\n\u2207\u2217 \u03c3 = \u2212tr|H \u2207\u03c3 = \u2212\u2207\u03c3(ea , ea ).\n\nWe need the following Proposition from [24], see also [37], which allows \"integration by parts\".\n\n\fTHE SHARP LOWER BOUND OF THE FIRST EIGENVALUE\n\n7\n\nProposition 2.4 ([24]).

The divergence formula implies that on a compact qc manifolds all eigenvalues of\nthe sub-Laplacian are non-negative. Our main result Theorem 1.1 gives a lower bound on the positive\neigenvalues. Therefore, Theorem 1.1 can also be interpreted as giving a bound from below on the first\neigenvalue \u03bb1 , i.e., of the smallest positive eigenvalue for which (3.2) holds.\nWe start with the proof of the following Bochner-type formula.\nTheorem 3.1.

A substitution of (5.7) and (5.6) in (5.5) followed by an\napplication of the Riemannian divergence formula give inequality (5.4).\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose that M is a qc-Einstein structure of dimension at least eleven with a normalized qc scalar S = 2, hence the qc Ricci tensor given by the first equality in (2.16) satisfies Ric = 4(n + 2)g.\nSuppose the equality case of Theorem 1.2 holds, i.e., \u03bb = 4n and let \u25b3f = \u03bbf . After a possible rescaling of\nf and using the divergence formula we have then the following identities\nZ\nf 2 V ol\u03b7 = 1,\n\u03bb = 4n,\n\u25b3f = 4nf,\nM\nZ\nZ\n(5.8)\n1\n2\n|\u2207f | V ol\u03b7 = \u03bb =\n|\u25b3f |2 V ol\u03b7 .\n\u03bb M\nM\n\n\fTHE SHARP LOWER BOUND OF THE FIRST EIGENVALUE\n\n13\n\nIn this case Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 together with equation (4.10) yield\nZ X\n3\n(5.9)\n(df (\u03bes ))2 V ol\u03b7 = 3.\nM s=1\n\nTherefore, from (5.9) we have the inequality\n(5.10)\n\n\u03bc \u2264 4n + 3.\n\nOn the other hand, any qc-Einstein manifold with a positive qc scalar curvature is locally 3-Sasakian [24]\nand it is well known that a 3-Sasakian manifold is Einstein (with respect to the extended metric) with\nRiemannian scalar curvature (4n+2) [31], i.e., the Riemannian Ricci tensor Ricg is given by\nRicg (A, A) = (4n + 2)g(A, A).\n\n(5.11)\n\nBy Lichnerowicz' theorem and (5.11) we have\n(5.12)\n\n\u03bc \u2265 4n + 3.\n\nThe inequalities (5.10) and (5.12) yield the equality\n(5.13)\n\n\u03bc = 4n + 3.\n\nTherefore, by Obata's result we conclude that the manifold (M, g) is isometric to the sphere S 4n+3 (1) and\nhence the manifold (M, g, Q) is qc equivalent to the 3-Sasakian sphere of dimension 4n + 3. This completes\nthe proof of Theorem 1.2.\n\u0003\n6. Sharp estimates for square integrals of derivatives\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.3.\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Notice that we are using a function which vanishes outside some compact so the\nintegrals are well defined. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1.1 except we have to express\n|(\u22072 f )[3] |2 in two different ways. This is the place where the qc case differs from the CR case. We start with\nthe identity (4.1), in which we first move the integral of the square of the sub-Laplacian to the left-hand side\nof the equality.

Let (M, \u03b7) be a (4n + 3)-dimensional qc-Einstein manifold, n > 1.

The point here is the precise value of the constant cn since even the more general\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund Lp version is well known to hold on nilpotent Lie groups, see [19] for an excellent overview.\nCorollary 6.2. Let (G (H), \u0398\u0303) be the (4n + 3)-dimensional Heisenberg group equipped with its standard qc\nstructure. For any f \u2208 C\u221e\no (G (H)) we have\nr\n1\n2\n(6.4)\nk\u2207 f kL2 (G (H)) \u2264 cn k\u25b3f kL2(G (H)) ,\ncn = 1 + .\nn\nAs a consequence of the above estimate, [17] and [16] which generalize Cordes' results to the subRiemannian setting it follows that for\n\u221a\nn + n 16n2 + 8n \u2212 3\n(6.5)\n2\u2264p<2+\n4n2 + 2n \u2212 1\na p-harmonic function on an open set \u03a9 \u2282 G (H) on the quaternionic Heisenberg group of dimension 4n + 3,\n2,2\nf \u2208 S 1,p (G (H)), has in fact additional regularity f \u2208 Sloc\n(G (H)). Here S k,p (\u03a9) denote the usual nonisotropic Sobolev spaces, see for example [19]. Similarly to [17] and [16] one can then obtain a C1,\u03b1 under\nsuitable restrictions on p. Obtaining the C1,\u03b1 property of the solution is in general still an open problem\nexcept in some cases, see [16], [34] and [22] and references therein. The first C1,\u03b1 estimate was obtained for\nthe-Laplacian operator on the Heisenberg group [7].\nReferences\n[1] Astengo, F., Cowling, M., & Di Blasio, B., The Cayley transform and uniformly bounded representations, J.
