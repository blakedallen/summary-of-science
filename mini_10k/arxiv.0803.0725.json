Introduction\nIn classical particle system, the energy current between particles was considered by Lepri,\nLivi and Politi with the approximation of low\u2013k limit.1) Takesue produced the energy current between particles from the energy density formed by the Dirac delta function and the\ncontinuity equation.2) This method is close to the work by Irving and Kirkwood.3) These\nmethods can treat only two\u2013body interaction. However, molecular dynamics (MD) which\nsimulates atoms and molecules generally adopt multi\u2013body interaction to represent molecular structures and chemical properties. In the present paper, the Takesue's method is\nintroduced and our new method enables to derive the energy current between particles from\nthe multi\u2013body interaction.\n\u00a72. Energy Field by Dirac Delta Function\nWe derive the energy density and the energy flux according to Takesue's work.2) Hamiltonian in many\u2013particle system is given by\nX pi (t) 2\nH=\n+ U(r1 (t), r2 (t), * * * ),\n2mi\ni\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ri (t), pi (t) and mi are the i\u2013th particle position, momentum and mass, respectively.\nHere, the i\u2013th particle energy ei (t) is defined by\npi (t) 2\n+ ui (t),\n2mi\n\nei (t) =\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere pi (t) 2 /2mi and ui (t) are the i\u2013th particle kinetic energy and interaction energy. The\nP\nparticle interaction energies ui (t) satisfy U(r1 (t), r2 (t), * * * ) =\ni ui (t). Using the Dirac\ndelta function, the particle energies ei (t) are localized at the particle positions ri (t). Then\nthe energy density e(x, t) is defined by\ne(x, t) =\n\nX\n\nei (t)\u03b4(x \u2212 ri (t)),\n\n(2.3)\n\ni\n\nwhere x = (x, y, z) is space coordinates.\nBecause total energy is a conservative quantity, the energy density constructs continuity\nequation\n\u2202e(x, t)\n+ \u2207 * j(x, t) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith the vector field j(x, t) which is regarded as the energy flux. The energy flux j(x, t)\nshould consists of the following two parts. As the i\u2013th particle moves at velocity \u1e59i , energy\n2\n\n\fcurrent ei \u1e59i is generated at the i\u2013th particle position ri . In addition, interaction transports\nenergy between particles by the interaction. From these points of view, the energy flux\nj(x, t) is given by\nj(x, t) =\n\nX\n\nei (t)\u1e59i (t)\u03b4(x \u2212 ri (t)) +\n\ni\n\nX\n\nji\u2192k (t)\u03c7ik (x, t),\n\n(2.5)\n\ni,k>i\n\nwhere ji\u2192k (= \u2212jk\u2192i ) is the magnitude of the energy current from the i\u2013th particle to the\nk\u2013th one and \u03c7ik (x, t) is the vector field. The first and second terms of the right\u2013hand in\nEq. (2.5) are the energy currents due to the movement of particles and due to interaction\nbetween particles, respectively. To satisfy Eq. (2.4), the relation\n\u2207 * \u03c7ik (x, t) = \u03b4(x \u2212 ri (t)) \u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 rk (t)),\nis imposed on the vector field \u03c7ik (x, t). Thereby, we obtain\nX\ndei (t)\n=\u2212\nji\u2192k (t).\ndt\nk6=i\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nThus, if the time derivative of the i\u2013th particle energy dei /dt consists of the elements of\nP\nsummation k6=i , we can regard the elements as the energy current from i\u2013th particle to\nthe k\u2013th one ji\u2192k (t). To derive ji\u2192k (t) from Eq. (2.7), we must consider the i\u2013th particle\ninteraction energy ui (t). Two\u2013body interaction potential energy is simply allocated to the\nparticle energies ui (t) into equal halves. However, multi\u2013body interaction potential energy\ncannot be divided into the the particle energies ui (t).\nDetermination the particle interaction energy ui (t) is unnecessary as long as the time\nderivative of the particle interaction energy dui /dt is given. If Hamiltonian system conserves\ntotal momentum, multi\u2013body interaction potential has to be a function of relative position\nvectors U(r\u030412 (t), * * * , r\u0304ik (t), * * * , r\u0304N \u22121,N (t)), where r\u0304ik \u2261 ri \u2212rk is the relative position vector\nfrom the k\u2013th particle to the i\u2013th one. We note that the multi\u2013body interaction potential\nis not always the function only of the distance between particles rik = |r\u0304ik |.\nAccording to the fact that the multi\u2013body interaction potential is the function of the\nrelative position vectors r\u0304ik , the total differential of the total interaction potential is\nX \u2202U\n* dr\u0304ik (t)\ndU(r\u030412 (t), * * * , r\u0304ik (t), * * * , r\u0304N \u22121,N (t)) =\n\u2202\nr\u0304\nik\ni,k>i\n1 X \u2202U\n=\n* r\u0304 \u0307 ik (t)dt.\n(2.8)\n2\n\u2202 r\u0304ik\ni,k6=i\n\nFrom this, the time derivative of the particle interaction energy is given by\ndui\n1 X \u2202U\n* (\u1e59i (t) \u2212 \u1e59k (t)) dt.\n=\ndt\n2 k6=i \u2202 r\u0304ik\n3\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fP\nThereby, the time derivative of the i\u2013th particle energy is written by the summation k6=i\nas follows;\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\ndei\ndui\n\u2202U\nd pi 2\n1 X pi\npk\n+\n*\n=\n=\u2212\n+\n.\n(2.10)\ndt\ndt 2mi\ndt\n2 k6=i mi mk\n\u2202 r\u0304ik\nAs a result, the energy current between particles ji\u2192k becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 pi\n\u2202U\npk\nji\u2192k =\n*\n+\n.\n2 mi mk\n\u2202 r\u0304ik\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe partial derivative \u2202U/\u2202 r\u0304ik (= \u2212\u2202U/\u2202 r\u0304ki ) is the force which acts on the k\u2013th particle\ndue to the variation of the relative position vector r\u0304ik in the multi\u2013body interaction. This\nmethod is effective in arbitrary multi\u2013body potentials.\n\u00a73. Application to Hydrogen Adsorption\nWe demonstrate the application of the energy current between particles to the MD simulation which dealt with the adsorption of a hydrogen atom on a graphene. The incident\nenergy of the hydrogen atom was set to 3 eV.

It was understood that the energy of about 2 eV was\n\ntransferred from the hydrogen atom to the graphene as the hydrogen atom is adsorbed.\n\u00a74. Summary\nThe energy density and the energy flux was introduced along the Takesue's method. The\nparticle energies ei (t) were localized at the particle positions ri (t) using Dirac delta function\nas Eq. (2.3).
