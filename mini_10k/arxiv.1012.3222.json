Indeterminism, in turn, implies nonuniversality of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. But the denial of the Principle may result in arbitrariness in arguments. Therefore,\nthe Principle formulated explicitly by Leibnitz [1] has been regarded to be an indispensable law\nof formal logic by a number of philosophers [2\u20134].\nIn physics, the concept of indeterminism, or indeterminacy relates to quantum jump dynamics, namely, reflects the contingency of the results of state vector reduction. In a series of the\nresults, there appear probabilistic regularities, but an individual result is unexplainable, which\nis in conflict with the Principle of Sufficient Reason, or falls under the Principle of Insufficient\nReason.\nDissatisfaction with such a state of affairs has been expressed by some physicists, among\nthem Einstein [5,6] and Dirac [7].\nA number of attempts to reintroduce the Principle of Sufficient Reason and, by the same token, determinism into quantum physics have been undertaken via introducing hidden variables\n(see [8,9] and references therein).\nIn [10], we have advanced a deterministic quantum jump dynamics based on jump instants\nwith respect to graduated cosmic time.\nIn this paper, an explicit indeterministic quantum jump dynamics is constructed, and this\ndynamics may be naturally transformed into a deterministic one. Finally, it is shown that a\nconsistent application of the Principle of Sufficient Reason results naturally in the deterministic\ndynamics advanced in [10], so that the latter may be regarded as a canonical one.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nThe Principle of Sufficient Reason,\ndeterminism and indeterminism\nThe Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nThere are four laws of formal logic. Three Aristotelian laws of identity, contradiction, and\nexcluded middle are applied for finding truths of reason; Leibnitz's Principle of Sufficient Reason\nis applied for discovering empirical or contingent truths.\nThe Principle of Sufficient Reason is expressed in the following manner [1]:\n\"Nothing takes place without a sufficient reason. Which means that nothing takes place\nwithout it be possible to he who would sufficiently know the things, to give a reason that would\nsuffice for determining why it is so instead of otherwise...\nAlthough the said reason cannot, most of the time, be known to us...\"\nIt is obvious that the Principle has a direct bearing on quantum jump dynamics.\n\n1.2\n\nDeterminism and indeterminism\n\nDeterminism is the doctrine, or theory that all that happens, every event is completely determined by a necessary previously existing cause.\n\n2\n\n\fIn the realm of classical physics, the concept of determinism has been expressed by Laplace\n[11]:\n\"An intelligence capable of knowing, at a given instant, all the forces and the disposition of\nall the entities present in nature, and sufficiently profound to submit all these data to analysis,\nwould grasp within the same formula the motions of the largest bodies in the universe and\nthose of the lightest atoms; to her, nothing would be uncertain and the future as well as the\npast would be present to her eyes.\"\nIndeterminism is the negation of determinism.\n\n1.3\n\nInterrelation between the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\ndeterminism and indeterminism\n\nThe Principle of Sufficient Reason implies determinism, so that we have the implication\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason \u21d2 determinism\n\n(1.3.1)\n\nfrom which follows another one:\nindeterminism \u21d2 the Principle of Insufficient Reason\n\n(1.3.2)\n\nBut, on the other hand,\ndeterminism ; the Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\n(1.3.3)\n\nThe Principle is a law of logic, whereas determinism is a doctrine relating to the universe and\nbased on the Principle.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nProbability and sequential probability spaces.\nRandom and nonrandom sequences\nProbability space\n\nProperties of quantum jumps are described in terms of probability and randomness, so it is\nappropriate to recall some basics [12,13].\nA probability space is a triplet\n(\u03a9, F , P )\n(2.1.1)\nwhere \u03a9 is the space of elementary outcomes, \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, F is a \u03c3-algebra of subsets of \u03a9, and\nP is a probability measure on a measurable space (\u03a9, F ). For an event C \u2208 F , P (C) is the\nprobability of C.\n\n2.2\n\nSequential probability space\n\nThe sequential probability space based on the space (2.1.1) is the space of sequences of elements\nof \u03a9, i.e., elementary outcomes:\n(\u03a9\u0303, F\u0303, P\u0303 ),\n\n\u03a9\u0303 = {\u03c9\u0303 = (\u03c91 , \u03c92 , * * *), \u03c9i \u2208 \u03a9, i \u2265 1}\n\nwhere F\u0303 and P\u0303 are generated by F and P [12].\n3\n\n(2.2.1)\n\n\f2.3\n\nRandom and nonrandom sequences\n\nRoughly speaking, a sequence \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303 is nonrandom if and only if it may be given by an\nalgorithm; otherwise it is random. A very important kind of randomness is 1-randomness [13].\nAs to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, it has a direct bearing on contingency in physics\nbut is unrelated to randomness in mathematics.\n\n3\n\nIndeterministic quantum jump sequences\n\n3.1\n\nQuantum jump: State vector reduction\n\nState vector reduction is described as follows:\n|i =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nci |ii, h|i = 1, hi|i i = \u03b4ii\u2032 ,\n\nn\nX\n\n|iihi| = I, n \u2265 2\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nreduction\n\n|i \u2212\u2192 |ii with probability pi = |ci |2 = |hi|i|2\n\n3.2\n\n(3.1.1)\n(3.1.2)\n\nProbability space and sequential space\n\nThe probability space (2.1.1) is discrete:\n(\u03a9, F , P ),\n\n\u03a9 = {|ii : i = 1, 2, * * * , n, n \u2265 2}\n\n(3.2.1)\n\nF is the family of all subsets of \u03a9, F = 2\u03a9 ,\nP ({i}) = pi\n\n(3.2.2)\n\nThe sequential space (2.2.1) is:\n(\u03a9\u0303, F\u0303, P\u0303 ),\n\n3.3\n\n\u03a9\u0303 = {\u03c9\u0303 = (|l1 i, |l2 i, * * *), |lk i \u2208 \u03a9, k \u2265 1}\n\n(3.2.3)\n\nIndeterminism: Random sequences\n\nIn quantum theory, it is assumed that sequences \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303 related to quantum jumps are random;\nthis is quantum indeterminism.\nNow we quote Einstein [6]:\n\"That the Lord should play with dice, all right; but that He should gamble according to\ndefinite rules, that is beyond me.\"\nIndeed, for different |i and different {|ii}ni=1 , the rules should be different; this is too much\nto comprehend.\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nThe indeterministic universe\n\n4.1\n\nDistribution function for a discrete probability space\n\nIn the universe, actual quantum jumps do not fall under the pattern analyzed in the previous\nSection. Now we will develop an adequate treatment. As the starting point, we introduce a\ndistribution function on a discrete probability space.\nConsider a discrete probability space:\n(\u03a9, F , P ), \u03a9 = {\u03c9i : i = 1, 2, * * * , n, 2 \u2264 n \u2264 \u221e}, F = 2\u03a9 , pi =: P ({\u03c9i }),\n\nn\nX\n\npi = 1 (4.1.1)\n\ni=1\n\nIntroduce a random variable\n\u03be : \u03a9 \u2192 R, \u03c9i \u058c \u03be(\u03c9i )\nwith\n\u03be(\u03c91 ) = p1 , \u03be(\u03c92 ) = p1 + p2 , * * * , \u03be(\u03c9i ) =\n\n(4.1.2)\ni\nX\n\n(4.1.3)\n\npk\n\nk=1\n\nThe distribution function is\n\nF\u03be (x) = P ({\u03c9i : \u03be(\u03c9i ) \u2264 x}), \u2212\u221e < x < \u221e\n\n(4.1.4)\n\nIt holds that\nfor x < p1 , F\u03be (x) = 0;\n\nfor x \u2265 1, F\u03be (x) = 1\n\nfor x \u2208 [\u03be(\u03c9i ), \u03be(\u03c9i+1)), i + 1 \u2264 n, F\u03be (x) = \u03be(\u03c9i ) =\n\n(4.1.5)\ni\nX\n\npk\n\n(4.1.6)\n\nk=1\n\n4.2\n\nUnification: Reduction to uniform distribution\n\nThe next step is a unification of probability spaces (4.1.1). Introduce the probability space\n(\u03a9 = [0, 1), F = Borel \u03c3-algebra B, P = the Lebesgue measure \u03bb)\n\n(4.2.1)\n\nA random variable U is said to be uniformly distributed on [0, 1) if its distribution function has\nthe form\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 0 for x \u2264 0\nx for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1\nFU (x) =\n(4.2.2)\n\uf8f3\n1 for 1 \u2264 x\n\nThere exists a transformation which takes the uniform random variable U into an arbitrary\none [14]. In the case of the discrete probability space (4.1.1), the construction is as follows. Put\n[0, 1) \u220b ri = \u03be(\u03c9i ) =\n\ni\nX\nk=1\n\n5\n\npk\n\n(4.2.3)\n\n\fthen\npi = ri \u2212 ri\u22121 , r0 = 0\n\n(4.2.4)\n\npi = |[ri\u22121 , ri )| = \u03bb([ri\u22121 , ri ))\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\n[\npi =\n\u03bb([ri\u22121 , ri )) = \u03bb\n[ri\u22121 , ri ) = \u03bb([0, 1)) = 1\n\n(4.2.5)\n\nThus,\n\ni=1\n\n4.3\n\ni=1\n\n(4.2.6)\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nQuantum jump sequence in the universe\n\nNow, for a quantum jump sequence in the universe,\n(jump1 , jump2 , * * * , jumpj , * * *), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, n \u2264 \u221e\n\n(4.3.1)\n\nthe probabilities of outcomes are determined by a sequence of reals\n(r1 , r2 , * * * , rj , * * *), rj \u2208 [0, 1)\n\n(4.3.2)\n\ni\ni\u22121\nX\nX\npjk ,\npjk )\noutcome for jumpj is |jii iff rj \u2208 [\nk=1\n\n(4.3.3)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere pjk is the probability of outcome k, i.e., |jki for jumpj .\nReturn to the quotation in Subsection 3.3. Now the task for the Lord is considerably\nsimplified. For any jump He has to choose a real r \u2208 [0, 1).\nThe sequence\nf = (|jii)nj\n|ji\n(4.3.4)\ni=1\nmay be fixed by a natural condition:\n\npj1 \u2265 pj2 \u2265 * * *\n\n(4.3.5)\n\npji = pji+1 = * * * = pji+l\n\n(4.3.6)\n\npji > pji+1 > * * * > pji+l for t = tj + \u2206t, \u2206t \u2192 0\n\n(4.3.7)\n\nIf\nthen the condition is\n\nwhere tj is the instant of jumpj .\nAgain, jump1 is the first jump in the only (or any) cycle of the universe.\n\n4.4\n\nQuantum jump dynamics. Indeterminism\n\nSo, the treatment of quantum jump dynamics in the universe amounts to this. There is the\nprobability space (4.2.1)\n(\u03a9 = [0, 1), F = B, P = \u03bb), \u03a9 \u220b \u03c9 = r \u2208 [0, 1)\n6\n\n(4.4.1)\n\n\fand the related sequential probability space\n(\u03a9\u0303, F\u0303, P\u0303 ), \u03a9\u0303 \u220b \u03c9\u0303 = r\u0303 = (r1 , r2 , * * * , rj , * * *), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, n \u2264 \u221e\n\n(4.4.2)\n\nQuantum jump dynamics is determined by a sequence\nr\u0303 = (rj )nj=1 , rj \u2208 [0, 1), n \u2264 \u221e\n\n(4.4.3)\n\n(If n < \u221e, the sequence (4.4.3) is called a string.)\nLet the sequence r\u0303 (4.4.3) be random and not given in advance. Then the sequence of\nquantum jumps\n] = (jumpj )nj=1 , n \u2264 \u221e\njump\n(4.4.4)\nis contingent and, by the same token, indeterministic. (We use terms random and contingent\nfor mathematical and physical objects, respectively.)\n\n4.5\n\nInvoking the Principle of Sufficient Reason:\nDeterminism via randomness\n\nNow we invoke the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which implies determinism (1.3.1), i.e., a\npredictable sequence r\u0303 (4.4.3) and, by the same token, a predictable quantum jump dynamics.\nThere are two possibilities to obtain determinism on the basis of randomness.\n(i) r\u0303 is preassigned.\n(ii) A random r \u2208 [0, 1) is given and is expressed in the form of a binary expansion:\nr = 0.b1 b2 * * * , bi \u2208 {0, 1}\n\n(4.5.1)\n\nr1 = 0.b1 b2 * * * , r2 = 0.b2 b3 * * * , * * * , rj = 0.bj bj+1 * * *\n\n(4.5.2)\n\nPut\nThus we have obtained a given\nr\u0303 = (0.bj bj+1 * * *)nj=1 , n \u2264 \u221e\n\n(4.5.3)\n\nand, by the same token, a deterministic quantum jump dynamics.\n\n4.6\n\nInvoking the Principle of Sufficient Reason once more:\nDeterminism via jump instants\nwith respect to graduated cosmic time\n\nThe deterministic construction of the previous Section falls under the Principle of Insufficient\nReason: There is no sufficient reason for choosing both r\u0303 in the case (i) and r (4.5.1) in the case\n(ii): There are infinitely many possibilities. (This is a corroboration of the statement (1.3.3).)\nNote that, in the capacity of r in the case (ii), it would be possible to choose Chaitin's random\nnumber \u03a9U representing the halting probability of a universal Chaitin computer U since that\nnumber is not \"typically 1-random\" [13]. But the set of different \u03a9U is countably infinite.\n\n7\n\n\fWe take a recourse to a natural construction advanced in [10]. Time is a dimensional\nquantity, so that\nt = tunit \u03c4\n(4.6.1)\nwhere tunit is a unit of time and \u03c4 is dimensionless. Let \u03c4 = 0 relate to the beginning of the\nonly (or any) cycle of the universe. It holds that\n\u03c4 = m + r, m = 0, 1, 2, * * * , r \u2208 [0, 1)\n\n(4.6.2)\n\nLet \u03c4j be the instant of jumpj ,\n\u03c4j = mj + rj , mj = 0, 1, 2, * * * , rj \u2208 [0, 1)\n\n(4.6.3)\n\nChoose that rj in the capacity of rj in r\u0303 (4.4.3). This choice is natural, so that it falls under\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason.\nA natural choice of tunit is either\ntunit = tPlanck\n(4.6.4)\nor\ntunit = (\u03ba\u039b)tPlanck\n\n(4.6.5)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03ba = (tPlanck ) is the gravitational constant and \u039b is the cosmological constant.\nThus we have obtained a canonical deterministic quantum jump dynamics. It must be\nemphasized that the construction is independent of the mechanism of quantum jumps.\n\n4.7\n\nPseudorandomness due to complexity of the universe\n\nIn order that the canonical quantum dynamics result in an effective probabilistic structure, it\nis necessary (and sufficient) that the sequence\nr\u0303 = (rj )nj=1 ,\n\nrj given by (4.6.3)\n\n(4.7.1)\n\nbe pseudorandom. In a physical system, the pseudorandomness of this sort has its origin in the\ncomplexity of the system c[15\u201317,5,18]. And the universe is the most complicated system.\n\n4.8\n\nClassical and quantum determinism.\nArrow of time\n\nIn conclusion, we point out a difference between classical and quantum determinism. Classical\ndeterminism, i.e., determinism in classical physics may be expressed by the following implication:\nclassical determinism \u21d4 predictability and retrodictability\n(4.8.1)\nwhereas quantum determinism, i.e., determinism in quantum physics is characterized by the\nimplication\nquantum determinism \u21d4 predictability\n(4.8.2)\nbut\nquantum determinism < retrodictability\n\n(4.8.3)\n\nIt is relations (4.8.2) and (4.8.3) that give rise to the arrow of time in the quantum universe.\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Alex A.
