They were introduced in [1] and [4] and they arise\nin some situations connected with the Vassiliev knot invariants ([2]).\nA particular case of our theorem (that of the open disk) was proved\nby Fenn, Keyman and Rourke in [6], where it was pointed out that all\nthe topological difficulties of the proof relied on the so\u2013called diamond\nlemma. Their proof, although purely topological, was both quite involved\nand not adaptable (at least in an easy way) for general orientable surfaces.\nOn the other hand our approach results in a simpler proof, even for the\nopen disk case.\nAn algebraic generalization of this result can be found in [3], which\nin fact may include the surface case if applied together with the results\nof [7] concerning the monoid presentation. However, we think that a\ntopological and more down\u2013to\u2013earth proof of this result may shed some\nlight and contribute towards a better understanding of the subject.\nA final comment is in order : a different proof of this result, also based\nin the monoid presentation, has been announced to us by Bellingeri in a\nprivate communication.\n\n2\n\nThe singular braid monoid and the sin-\n\ngular braid group\nDefinition.\u2013 Let U be any orientable surface. If we fix beforehand n\ndistinct points P1 , ..., Pn \u2208 U , a geometric braid is a set of n differentiable\ndisjoint paths b1 , ..., bn inside the cylinder U \u00d7 [0, 1], such that bi (also\ncalled the i\u2013th string) goes, monotonically in t \u2208 [0, 1], from (Pi , 0) to\n(Pj , 1).\nA singular geometric braid is just the same as a geometric braid, except\nfor the fact that we allow a finite number of transversal intersections\nbetween two strings. The intersection points will be called singular points.\nIf we consider the braids modulo isotopies of U \u00d7 [0, 1] leaving fixed\nU \u00d7 {0, 1}, we get the singular braid monoid (of U ), noted SBn , with the\noperation defined by concatenation.\n\n2\n\n\fWe will note by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, ... the geometric braids and by \u03b1\nb, \u03b2b, b\n\u03b3 , ... their\ncorresponding classes in SBn .\nWhen U is the open disk D, SBn is a very well\u2013known monoid ([5]),\n\u22121\nd\ngenerated by the braids \u03c3bi , \u03c3\nbi , where \u03c3i , \u03c3i\u22121 , \u03c4i are the geometric\ni ,\u03c4\n\u22121\nd\nbraids shown below. We will also speak of \u03c3bi , \u03c3\nbi in the general case,\ni ,\u03c4\n\nby means of the natural embedding of the singular braid monoid of the\ndisk into SBn .\n\nIn what follows, we will draw braids only in the cylinder D \u00d7 [0, 1] (for\nthe sake of simplicity), although our arguments will work for U \u00d7 [0, 1].\nWe will introduce now the analogous setup to that of Fenn, Keyman\nand Rourke in [6] for the disk case.\nDefinition.\u2013 We will call M the monoid where the elements are geometric\nsingular braids (modulo isotopies) in which every singular point is assigned\na colour, black or white.\nWe will then note by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, ... the geometric braids (with coloured\nsingular points) and by \u03b1\nb, \u03b2b, b\n\u03b3 , ... their corresponding classes in M .\nRemark.\u2013 There is a surjection from M to SBn which consists on forgetting the colours of the singular points. On the other hand, SBn can\nbe embedded in M by assigning the black colour to every singular point.\nThe image of \u03c4bi under this injection will be noted also by \u03c4bi , while we\nwill note by \u03c5i the braid obtained by assigning the white colour to the\nsingular point of \u03c4i . We will call \u03c5bi the opposite of \u03c4bi .\n\n3\n\n\fWithout explicit mention we will consider SBn as a submonoid of M ,\nusing the above injection.\nDefinition.\u2013 If we add to M the relations \u03c4bi \u03c5bi = \u03c5bi \u03c4bi = 1, we obtain a\ngroup, called the singular braid group (of U ), noted SGn .\n\nThe relations \u03c4bi \u03c5bi = \u03c5bi \u03c4bi = 1 in SGn .\nFrom now on, if a singular braid has the form, say \u03b1\nb = \u03b11d\n\u03c4i \u03b12 , and\nwe do not care about who \u03b11 and \u03b12 are, we will draw it as follows:\n\n3\n\nThe embedding theorem\n\nTheorem.\u2013 The natural map SBn \u2212\u2192 SGn is one\u2013to\u2013one.\nBefore proving the result we will introduce a few notations. For \u03b1, \u03b2\ngeometric singular braids, we will note \u03b1 \u0580 \u03b2 if there exist \u03b11 , \u03b21 such\nthat \u03b1\nb=c\n\u03b11 , \u03b2b = \u03b2b1 and we can obtain \u03b21 from \u03b11 by adding a pair of\nconsecutive opposite singular points. In the same way, we will note \u03b1 \u0581 \u03b2\nif there exist \u03b11 , \u03b21 such that \u03b1\nb=c\n\u03b11 , \u03b2b = \u03b2b1 and we can obtain \u03b21 from\n\u03b11 by erasing a pair of consecutive opposite singular points.\nRemark.\u2013 Note that \u03b1\nb and \u03b2b define the same element on SGn if and\nonly if there exist \u03b1 = \u03b10 , \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k = \u03b2 such that either \u03b1i \u0580 \u03b1i+1 or\n\u03b1i \u0581 \u03b1i+1 for all i = 0, ..., k \u2212 1.\nThe following result is the key part of the proof of the theorem, as\nnoted in [6], where it is proved for the case U = D. The proof will be\ngiven in the following section.\n\n4\n\n\fDiamond lemma.\u2013 Let \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 be geometric singular braids such that\n\u03b1 \u0580 \u03b2 \u0581 \u03b3. Then, either \u03b1\nb=b\n\u03b3 , or there exists \u03b7 such that \u03b1 \u0581 \u03b7 \u0580 \u03b3.\nDefinition.\u2013 We will say \u03b1\nb \u2208 M is irreducible if there is no \u03b2 with \u03b1 \u0581 \u03b2.\nCorollary.\u2013 If \u03b1\nb, \u03b2b \u2208 M are irreducible and define the same element in\nSGn , then \u03b1\nb = \u03b2b in M .\nThe proof is immediate from the diamond lemma (see [6]) and, besides,\nas the elements of SBn are irreducible (they only have black singular\npoints), this proves that the map from SBn to SGn is an embedding.\nHence the theorem is proved, up to the diamond lemma.\n\n4\n\nThe diamond lemma\n\nGiven a geometric singular braid \u03b2, with a singular point p on it, we will\ndenote by \u03b2(p+ ) and \u03b2(p\u2212 ) the braid obtained from \u03b2 by replacing p by\na positive and negative crossing, respectively. That is, if \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u03c4i \u03b22 ,\n(where p is the singular point in \u03c4i ) we will have \u03b2(p+ ) = \u03b21 \u03c3i \u03b22 and\n\u03b2(p\u2212 ) = \u03b21 \u03c3i\u22121 \u03b22 . In a similar way, if we have p1 , ..., pm singular points\non \u03b2, we will write \u03b2(ps11 , ..., psmm ) the braid obtained by replacing each pi\nby a crossing with sign si \u2208 {+, \u2212}.\nIf we have a singular braid \u03b2, with a singular point p on it, we will\nwrite \u03b2(p\u2022 ) and \u03b2(p\u25e6 ) the braid obtained from \u03b2 by replacing p (no matter\nwhich colour it has) by a black point and a white point, respectively.\nLemma 1.\u2013 Let \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 be geometric singular braids, p a singular point\non \u03b2. Assume \u03b2b = \u03b2b\u2032 and let us call also p the point corresponding to p\nin \u03b2 \u2032 . Then:\n+ ) = \u03b2 \u2032d\nd\n1. \u03b2(p\n(p+ ).\n\u2212 ) = \u03b2 \u2032d\nd\n2. \u03b2(p\n(p\u2212 ).\n\nProof.\u2013 As both cases are analogous, we will do the first case only.\nAs \u03b2b = \u03b2b\u2032 , there exists an isotopy of the cylinder, Ht , with H0 (\u03b2) = \u03b2,\nH1 (\u03b2) = \u03b2 \u2032 . Take a sphere S centered at p with radius small enough such\nthat the only strings intersecting S are those forming the singular point.\nWe can assume that \u03b2(p+ ) and \u03b2 coincide outside S.\n\n5\n\n\fWe can suppose that H1 (S) is also a sphere centered at p on \u03b2 \u2032 . Hence,\nif we apply H1 to \u03b2(p+ ), we obtain the braid \u03b2 \u2032 , except for the fact that\nthe point p has been replaced by a positive crossing (since U is orientable).\nThat is, we get \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ ). So H1 (\u03b2(p+ )) = \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ ).\nLemma 2.\u2013 Let \u03b2b \u2208 M , having two consecutive singular points, p and q.\ns , q c ) = \u03b2(p\nc , q s ), with s \u2208 {+, \u2212}, c \u2208 {\u2022, \u25e6}.\nd\nThen \u03b2(pd\n\nProof.\u2013 This result is a straightforward consequence of the well known\nrelation \u03c3i \u03c4i = \u03c4i \u03c3i in the singular braid monoid of the disk.\n\nWe can now proceed to prove the diamond lemma. As \u03b1 \u0580 \u03b2 we can\nconsider, with no loss of generality, that \u03b1 = \u03b2(p+ , q \u2212 ) for some pair p, q\nof opposite consecutive points in \u03b2. On the other side, as \u03b2 \u0581 \u03b3, let us\ncall \u03b2 \u2032 the braid verifying \u03b2b = \u03b2b\u2032 and, as above, \u03b3 = \u03b2 \u2032 (r + , s\u2212 ) for a pair\nr, s of opposite consecutive points in \u03b2 \u2032 .\nLet us call H the cylinder isotopy taking \u03b2 into \u03b2 \u2032 . Then, using our preH\n\nvious notation, we can write \u03b1 = \u03b2(p+ , q \u2212 ) \u0580 \u03b2 \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 \u0581 \u03b2 \u2032 (r + , s\u2212 ) = \u03b3.\nThe technique used for the proof is heavily related to the proof of\nlemma 1. In fact, we will make an extensive use of the fact that H brings\ntogether r and s, while possibly moving apart p and q, and H \u22121 acts the\nother way around. This fact, together with the using of the small spheres\nas in lemma 1, will give us the result.\nWe will assume that p is above q and r is above s from now on. Then\nwe need to distinguish three cases:\n(a) p = r, q = s.\n\n6\n\n\f(b) p, q, r, s are all distinct.\n(c) p = s or q = r.\nCase (a) This is the easiest situation. As \u03b2b = \u03b2b\u2032 , from lemma 1 we have\n+ ) = \u03b2 \u2032d\n+ , q \u2212 ) = \u03b2 \u2032 (p\n+, q\u2212 ) = b\nd\nd\n\u03b2(p\n(p+ ). Hence \u03b1\nb = \u03b2(pd\n\u03b3.\n\nCase (b) In this case \u03b2 has two pairs of opposite singular points, (p, q)\nand (r, s), of which (p, q) are consecutive. Hence \u03b2 can be assumed to\nhave the form \u03b21 \u03c4i \u03c5i \u03b22 , and the analogous thing happens with \u03b2 \u2032 and\n(r, s).\n\nThen we can write\nH\n\nH \u22121\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2(p+ , q \u2212 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2212 ) \u0581 \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2212 , r + , s\u2212 ) \u2212\u2192\nH \u22121\n\nH\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b2(p+ , q \u2212 , r + , s\u2212 ) \u0580 \u03b2(r + , s\u2212 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 (r + , s\u2212 ) = \u03b3.\n\nThis proves the existence of \u03b7 = \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2212 , r + , s\u2212 ) with \u03b1 \u0581 \u03b7 \u0580 \u03b3.\nCase (c) We will do the subcase q = r, the other one being symmetric.\nWe have\n\n7\n\n\fThen, from lemma 2,\nH\n\n\u223c\n\nH \u22121\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2(p+ , q \u2212 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2212 ) = \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2212 , s\u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 (p+ , q \u2022 , s\u2212 ) \u2212\u2192\nH \u22121\n\nH\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b2(p+ , q \u2022 , s\u2212 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2(p\u2022 , q + , s\u2212 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 (p\u2022 , q + , s\u2212 ) = \u03b3,\n\u223c\n\nwhere \u2212\u2192 stands for the (non\u2013specified) isotopies which come from applying the lemma 2.
