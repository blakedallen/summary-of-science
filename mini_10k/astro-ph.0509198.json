This is one of the only studies of a uniform sample of narrow-line Seyfert\n1 (NLS1) galaxies with such high sensitivity and resolution. Although we detect only one source, the entire\nsample is very radio-quiet down to strong limits. GH10 was found to have a radio power of 8.5 \u00d71021 W Hz\u22121 ,\nand a ratio R \u2261 f6cm / f4400 of 2.8. The 3 \u03c3 upper limits for the remaining nondetections correspond to radio\npowers from 3 \u00d7 1020 to 8 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 and 0.47 < R < 9.9. Stacking all nondetections yields an even stronger\nupper limit of R \u2264 0.27. An assessment of existing observations in the literature confirms our finding that NLS1s\nare consistently radio-quiet, with a radio-loud fraction of 0%\u20136%, which is significantly lower than the 10%\u201320%\nobserved in the general quasar population. By analogy with stellar-mass black holes, we argue that AGNs undergo\na state transition at Lbol /LEdd \u2248 0.01. Below this value a radiatively inefficient accretion flow effectively drives\nan outflow, which disappears when the flow turns into an optically thick, geometrically thin disk, or a radiation\npressure-dominated slim disk at still higher Lbol /LEdd .\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: jets - galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: Seyfert - galaxies: structure\n- radio continuum: galaxies\nably, these objects appear to obey the same MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation as\nthat established for high-mass systems (Barth et al. 2005), suggesting that a single physical mechanism operates over nearly\n5 orders of magnitude to maintain the observed relation.\nThis sample provides the opportunity to examine the broad\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of BHs in a new mass\nregime. As discussed by Greene & Ho (2004), the Eddington\nratios [Lbol /LEdd , where LEdd \u2261 1.26 \u00d7 1038 (MBH /M\u2299 ) ergs s\u22121 ]\nof the sample are all close to unity. To begin to characterize the\nSEDs of this unique sample, we obtained high-resolution 6 cm\ncontinuum observations using the Very Large Array (VLA)2 .\nOur sample probes a poorly explored region of parameter space,\nin terms of BH mass and Eddington ratio, and so may provide new insights into the physical drivers of radio properties\nin AGNs.\nThroughout we assume the following cosmological parameters to calculate distances: H0 = 100 h = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9m = 0.27, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.75 (Spergel et al. 2003).\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nVery little is known about the mass function of nuclear black\nholes (BHs) with mass below \u223c 106 M\u2299 . Until recently there\nwere only two secure candidates of intermediate-mass BHs in\ngalactic nuclei: NGC 4395 (Filippenko & Ho 2003) and POX\n52 (Barth et al. 2004). The tight correlation between host bulge\nvelocity dispersion and BH mass (the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) suggests that BHs\nplay an essential role in the evolution of galaxies, and yet we\nknow next to nothing empirical about the starting conditions, or\nseeds, of supermassive BHs. An understanding of the low-mass\nend of the BH mass function may provide one of the few observational constraints on seed BHs, at least prior to the Laser\nInterferometry Space Antenna (LISA; Hughes 2002). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether small galaxies, without classical bulges, may host central BHs, and whether they obey\nthe same MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation. For these reasons, Greene & Ho\n(2004) performed a systematic search for such a population of\nintermediate-mass BHs. They used the First Data Release of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS;York et al. 2000; Abazajian et\nal. 2003) to select a sample of broad-line active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) with virial mass estimates1 of MBH < 106 M\u2299 . This\nsample of 19 galaxies represents the only uniformly selected\nsample of intermediate-mass BHs in active galaxies. Remark-\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nAll observations were taken over 22.5 hours on 9 October\n2004, when the VLA was in A configuration (Thompson et al.\n1980). During the observations only two antennas were excluded from the array, and the weather conditions were good.\nWe observed at 4.860 GHz (6 cm; C band) with a bandwidth of\n\n1 Virial masses are calculated from the relation between AGN luminosity and broad-line region radius calibrated with reverberation-mapped AGNs (Kaspi et al.\n2000) and a measurement of velocity dispersion in the broad-line gas from the full-width at half-maximum of the broad H\u03b1 emission line (see, e.g., Greene & Ho\n2005). If \u03c5FWHM is the broad-line gas velocity dispersion, and L5100 is the AGN luminosity measured at 5100 \u00c5, the luminosity-radius relation from Kaspi et al.\n(2000) yields MBH = 4.82 \u00d7 106 (L5100 /1044 ergs s\u22121 )0.7 (\u03c5FWHM /1000 km s\u22121 ) M\u2299 .\n2 The VLA is operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement\nby Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGREENE, HO, & ULVESTAD\nTable 1.

Using the relation between L[OIII]\nand radio power for radio-quiet AGNs from Ho & Peng (2001;\nshown in Fig. 1), we predicted a radio power for each source,\nand thus the integration time required to reach a 5 \u03c3 detection\nthreshold (see Table 1), although we observed no source for less\nthan 10 minutes or longer than 2 hours. For purposes of phase\ncalibration, observations of the target were alternated every 3\u2013\n5 minutes with observations of a nearby (usually within \u223c 4\ndegrees), bright radio source. Our flux scale is tied to 3C 48,\nwith an assumed flux density of 5.4 Jy. Flux-scale uncertainties\nare dominated by uncertainties in the absolute flux of the phase\ncalibrators computed based on 3C 48 and are conservatively estimated to be \u223c 5%.\nInitial flux and phase calibration was performed within AIPS\n(Greisen 2003) on the observed visibilities, after removal of\ncorrupted records. The visibilities were then Fourier transformed to create an image of intensity on the sky. Confusing sidelobes were removed using the deconvolution algorithm\nCLEAN (H\u00f6gbom 1974) as modified by Clark (1980). Since\nthis is a detection experiment, we use \"natural\" weighting to\nmaximize our sensitivity. The resulting maps have a pixel scale\nof 0.\u2032\u2032 06 and a typical synthesized beam of \u2206\u03b8 \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 6. The half\npower beam width (primary beam) of the individual antennas is\n\u223c 9\u2032 , so we constructed images of this size to search for confusing sources in the field, which we found in only two cases\n(GH07 and GH14). The theoretical noise ranges from 0.02 to\n0.06 mJy beam\u22121 . Since CLEAN can change the noise statistics\nin a source-free image, aside from the three objects with flux in\nthe maps (GH07, GH10, and GH14), we performed subsequent\nanalysis directly on the \"dirty\" maps. In all cases we were able\n\nF IG . 1.- The trend of increasing radio power with increasing [O III] \u03bb5007\nluminosity.

In the three\ncases where CLEAN was required, we iterated until the \"clean\ncomponents\" reached a limiting flux of 3\u00d7 RMS, where RMS is\nthe theoretical noise limit, and in the case of GH07 and GH14,\nclean boxes were placed around the distant confusing sources.\nFinally, to investigate the possible presence of more extended\nemission, we also constructed images with a Gaussian tapering\nfunction that fell to 30% power at 200 k\u03bb, which resulted in a\ntypical synthesized beam of \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 . We note that our minimum\nspacing is \u223c 11 k\u03bb, corresponding to a maximum angular scale\nof \u2264 10\u2032\u2032 .\n3. RESULTS\n\nOnly one object in this study, GH10, was detected. For the\nremaining undetected targets, we computed 3 \u03c3 upper limits on\ntheir 6 cm radio powers, which range from 3 \u00d7 1020 to 8 \u00d7 1021\nW Hz\u22121 , and are shown as a function of L[OIII] in Figure 1 (triangles). The solid line is the L[OIII] -P6cm relation from Ho &\nPeng (2001) that we used to calculate observing times for our\nsample. Clearly our measurements do not follow this relation\n(note that the majority of the upper limits lie below the line,\nsince our integration times were designed to achieve 5 \u03c3 detections; exceptions are objects that required more than two hours\nof integration time). In order to illustrate the probable cause\nof the discrepancy, we include in Figure 1 the data from Ho\n& Peng used to derive our adopted L[OIII] -P6cm relation. Three\nsamples were included, to span the maximum range in optical nuclear luminosity (\u22128 \u2264 MB \u2264 \u221228 mag). The highestluminosity sources are the 87 Palomar-Green (PG) quasars with\nz < 0.5 (Schmidt & Green 1983), while low-luminosity Seyfert\ngalaxies are drawn from the Palomar spectroscopic survey of\n\n\fRadio-quiet AGNs\n\n3.1. GH10\nGH10 is the only object in the sample detected by the Faint\nImages of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm Survey (FIRST; Becker\net al. 1995) and is the only object detected here. Because of\nthe relatively large beam (\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 ) of FIRST and the low radio\npower of GH10 (2.0 \u00d7 1022 W Hz\u22121 ), Greene & Ho (2004) argue that the 20 cm emission from GH10 may originate from the\nhost galaxy rather than the AGN. Given the much superior angular resolution of our current image (\u2206\u03b8 = 0.\u2032\u2032 57 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u203242), most\nof the radio emission probably originates from the AGN itself\n(see Fig. 2). Using the task JMFIT within AIPS, we find that\nthe image is marginally resolved, with a deconvolved size of\n0.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u20322 (530 pc \u00d7 350 pc), a position angle of 9\u25e6 , and a total\nflux density of 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 mJy. Since the source is slightly resolved, there is most likely some host galaxy contribution, and\nso the peak flux density may give a better measure of the unresolved AGN emission. The peak flux density of 0.54 \u00b1 0.05\nmJy corresponds to a radio power of 8.5 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 . Using\nthe 4400 \u00c5 flux density from Table 1, we find an R value of 2.8\nfor this source. Since the source was also detected with FIRST,\nwe can estimate a crude spectral index \u03b1, where f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 .\nThis calculation is problematic because the observations were\nnonsimultaneous and made with very different resolutions. In\norder to minimize the uncertainties resulting from differing\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\nARC SEC\n\nnearby galaxies (Ho et al. 1995, 1997), supplemented at intermediate luminosity by the sample of Seyferts selected from the\nCfA redshift rurvey (Huchra & Burg 1992). The radio observations for the CfA Seyferts are presented in Kukula et al. (1995),\nthose for the Palomar Seyferts are from Ho & Ulvestad (2001)\nand Ulvestad & Ho (2001a), and the PG quasars were observed\nby Kellermann et al. (1989). As shown in Figure 1, our upper\nlimits are lower than the typical PG quasars, whose radio powers range from 7 \u00d7 1020 to 3 \u00d7 1027 W Hz\u22121 . [For reference the\n3.6 cm radio power of the quasars in the Large Bright Quasar\nSurvey (LBQS) range from 1023 to 1028 W Hz\u22121 (Visnovsky\net al. 1992).] They are more consistent with the distribution\nof radio powers of the Seyfert nuclei (\u223c 1018 to 1025 W Hz\u22121 ).\nRadio powers alone, however, are somewhat misleading, since\nBHs of different mass have different (limiting) Eddington luminosities. Complementary information is provided by the ratio\nR \u2261 f6cm / f4400 , where \"radio-loud\" objects are conventionally\ndefined as those with R \u2265 10 (Kellermann et al. 1989). Radioloud and radio-quiet objects are represented as filled and open\nsymbols in Figure 1, respectively. Among quasars, the radioloud fraction is \u223c 20% for the PG sample and \u223c 10% for the\nLBQS sample. In contrast, \u2265 60% of the Ho & Peng Seyfert\nsample are radio-loud, once the nuclear emission is properly\nisolated.\nNow we investigate possible reasons that the Ho & Peng\nL[OIII] -P6cm relation might overpredict the radio power of our\nsources. The relation was fit to the radio-quiet points only, and\nsince our entire sample is radio-quiet (GH10 has R = 2.8, while\nthe mean R for the rest is < 2.3), the discrepancy cannot be\nexplained by our choice of the optical-radio relation. However,\nvery few of the radio-quiet objects from Ho & Peng have [O III]\nluminosities less than 1041 ergs s\u22121 , while the majority of our\nobjects do. Either there is a break in the L[OIII] -P6cm relation at\nlow L[OIII] , or the true slope of the L[OIII] -P6cm relation is steeper\nthan that found by Ho & Peng, due to their limited dynamic\nrange. Actual detections of a sample such as that presented\nhere are required to distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-0.5\nARC SEC\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\nF IG . 2.- The A-array image of GH10 at 6 cm. The contours are \u22123, \u22122, 2,\n3, 6, 10 \u00d7 0.052 mJy beam\u22121 , which is the nominal RMS for the image. The\nbeam size, shown in the lower-left corner, is 0.\u2032\u2032 57 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 42. The coordinates\nare offset from the nominal optical SDSS position of GH10.\n\nresolutions, we use the FIRST peak flux density, 1.2 mJy\nbeam\u22121 , to find \u03b1 = 0.62. We emphasize that this is a very\nuncertain value.\nUnless otherwise stated, we omit GH10 from the following\ndiscussion.\n3.2. Upper Limits\nGiven that all but one of the objects in our sample were nondetections, we have devoted some care to deriving the most\nstringent possible upper limits on the radio emission from these\nsources. We derive RMS values from our final images within a\nbox enclosing the inner quarter of the image, and our nominal\nupper limits are simply 3 times this measured RMS. At worst,\nthe instrumental and atmospheric phase for each antenna on a\ngiven calibrator vary by no more than \u223c 20\u25e6 over a 5-minute\nperiod. There are no substantial phase changes even between\ncalibrators in very different regions of the sky; over the course\nof 18 hours of our 24-hour observation, the phase calibration\nremained stable within 10\u25e6 for each antenna. This implies a coherence loss of less than 1% for our target objects, independent\nof the angular separation between calibrator and target, leading\nto the conclusion that our cited upper limits are accurate and\nquite robust.\nWhile we were unable to detect any of our objects individually, we can construct a single, deep image by coadding all the\nobservations. This approach has been applied successfully with\nnondetections in FIRST of SDSS (Glikman et al. 2004) and\n2QZ (Wals et al. 2005) AGNs. Stacking is performed in the image plane. Since the FIRST observations have uniform sensitivity, they can be summed directly. In our case, because exposure\ntimes varied between observations, we give additional weight\nto those with the highest sensitivity. We compute a weightedaverage image using the task COMB within AIPS, where the\nweights are simply 1/RMS2 and the images are aligned to their\ncentral pixel. We expect all the sources to lie within the central\n0.\u2032\u2032 1, since our positions depend on SDSS astrometry, which\nhas an accurary of \u2264 0.\u2032\u2032 1 (Stoughton et al. 2001), and the as-\n\n\f4\n\nGREENE, HO, & ULVESTAD\n\ntrometric accuracy of the VLA phase calibrators is also \u2264 0.\u2032\u2032 1\n(Wilkinson et al. 1998; VLA calibrator manual3). The individual maps used in the stacking analysis were thus constructed\nwith 0.\u2032\u2032 1 pixels. The effective RMS of our stacked image is\n0.0069 mJy beam\u22121 , which is approximately one-third of our\nbest RMS for a single exposure. This is roughly as expected,\nsince we have increased the on-source exposure time from a\nmaximum of 2 hours to 16 hours. We take our upper limit as\n3\u00d7RMS and an average f4400 = 0.077 mJy (from the values\npublished in Greene & Ho 2004; see Table 1) to find an effective limit on the R parameter of 0.27. We are therefore able to\nplace a far more stringent upper limit for the sample ensemble\nthan for any individual source.\nFor completeness, we also derived upper limits on extended\nemission from the host galaxies themselves, using lowerresolution, tapered images with a synthesized beam \u2206\u03b8 = 1\u2032\u2032 .\nOur upper limits correspond to an average 6 cm radio power of\n\u223c 1.8 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 , which is roughly similar to the 1.4 GHz\npower of normal (inactive) L\u2217 galaxies (Condon 1992). Given\nthat the galaxies in this sample are relatively faint, \u223c 1 mag\nfainter than L\u2217 (Greene & Ho 2004), this is not a very strong\nlimit, but it does indicate that the hosts are not experiencing\nany vigorous starburst activity. Assuming a radio spectral index of \u03b1 = 0.7, the inferred average 20 cm radio power of\n4.2 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 translates into an approximate star formation rate of \u223c 2.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Yun et al. 2001).\n3.3. Comparison with Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies\nA natural comparison may be drawn between our sample\nand NGC 4395, the prototypical AGN with an intermediatemass BH. NGC 4395 has been imaged in the radio with the\nVLA (Moran et al. 1999; Ho & Ulvestad 2001) and the Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA; Wrobel et al. 2001). At an\nassumed distance of 4.2 Mpc (Thim et al. 2004), the VLA\nobservations of Ho & Ulvestad (2001) give a 6 cm power of\n1.7 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 , a 20 cm power of 3.5 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 , and a\nspectral index of \u03b1 = 0.6. The 20 cm VLBA image has a diameter less than 11 mas and a total power of 1.1 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 ,\nimplying that some of the flux has been resolved by the VLBA.\nDeeper VLBA imaging of NGC 4395 is underway to search\nfor a potential jet component (J. M. Wrobel, J. S. Ulvestad, &\nL. C. Ho in preparation). Using the f4400 measurement from\nFilippenko & Ho (2003), we find that NGC 4395 has R \u2248 2.0.\nMore generally, the objects presented here technically belong\nto the subclass of AGNs known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s; Osterbrock & Pogge 1985). Formally, these are\nbroad-line AGNs with FWHM \u2264 2000 km s\u22121 for the H\u03b2 line.\nThey also tend to have low [O III]/H\u03b2 ratios, high Fe II/H\u03b2 ratios, and prominent soft X-ray excesses (e.g., Boller et al. 1996;\nbut see Williams et al. 2004). This set of properties suggests\nthat NLS1s are low-mass BHs radiating near their Eddington\nlimits (Pounds et al. 1995). All of our objects (as does NGC\n4395) qualify as NLS1s based on the H\u03b2 linewidth criterion, although their Fe II and [O III] strengths cover a wider range than\ntypical NLS1s (Greene & Ho 2004), and therefore comparisons\nwith NLS1 properties are natural.\nAnecdotally, NLS1s are thought to be radio-quiet as a class,\nalthough few statistical samples have been considered in the literature. Ulvestad et al. (1995) assembled new and published radio data for a total of 15 NLS1s, of which nine were detections.\nWe have gathered optical continuum luminosities for 11 of the\n3 http://www.vla.nrao.edu/astro/\n\nUlvestad et al. objects (excluding Mrk 291, Mrk 957, IRAS\n1509\u2212211, and 1747.3+6836), using H\u03b2 flux and equivalent\nwidth measurements from Osterbrock & Pogge (1985) when\navailable, or else manually estimating the continuum fluxes\nfrom spectra published in V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. (2001). Mrk 783,\nwith R = 400, is the only radio-loud object in the sample. As\npointed out by Ulvestad et al., their sample of NLS1s is by no\nmeans complete, making this statistic difficult to interpret.\nA number of other studies have used large radio surveys to\nestimate the radio-loud fraction among NLS1s. Zhou & Wang\n(2002) collected SEDs from the literature for a sample of 205\nNLS1s in the V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2001) catalog. They defined a subsample of 182 sources that fall within the footprint\nof the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998).\nOf these, 63 are detected and 11 (6%) qualify as radio-loud (R\n> 10), although none are \"very\" radio-loud (R > 300). Zhou\net al. (2003) discuss the radio properties of a sample of 175\nNLS1s from the SDSS Early Data Release (Stoughton et al.\n2002). It is unclear exactly what the selection criteria were for\nthis sample, but \u223c 6% are detected by FIRST, and two (1%) of\nthose can be deemed radio-loud. Lastly, Stepanian et al. (2003)\npresented SEDs from the literature for the NLS1s in the Second Byurkanan Survey (Markarian et al. 1983), selected to\nhave FWHMH\u03b2 < 2000 km s\u22121 and [O III]/H\u03b2 < 3. Ten of\ntheir 26 objects have radio detections, and all are radio-quiet.\nIn all the above cases, the fraction of radio-loud NLS1s seems\nto be low (0%\u20136%) in comparison to the parent samples of normal, luminous broad-line AGNs (10%\u201320%). Unfortunately\nour ability to interpret the nondetections is hampered by the use\nof relatively shallow surveys at low resolution (e.g., NVSS or\nFIRST). Nondetections may be radio-loud or radio-quiet, while\ndetections may contain significant contamination from the host\ngalaxy. For instance, a typical NLS1 at z = 0.1 with MBH =\n106 M\u2299 and Lbol /LEdd = 1 will not be detected by FIRST below a limiting R of 17 [assuming a 1 mJy detection limit and a\nflat (\u03b1 = 0) radio spectrum]. Moreover, the definition of NLS1s\nvaries from study to study, with unknown consequences for the\nunderlying properties of each group.\nA possibly more pertinent comparison with our sample\ncomes from the PG survey, since it has available sensitive, highresolution radio observations (Kellermann et al. 1989) and homogeneous optical spectrophotometric data (Neugebauer et al.\n1987). Among the 87 z < 0.5 sources, 18 meet the H\u03b2 linewidth\ncriterion of NLS1s (Boroson & Green 1992). Their 6 cm radio\npowers range from 1.7 \u00d71021 to 2.5 \u00d71024 W Hz\u22121 , and they\nare predominantly radio-quiet (94%), with only a single radioloud object (PG 1211+143). The radio-quiet objects have R\nfrom 0.2 to 2.5, and a mean of 0.54. Interestingly, the stacked\nupper limit of our sample is lower than the mean R for the PG\nNLS1s.\nWhile the evidence summarized above suggests that NLS1s,\nas a class, are exceptionally radio-quiet, it is worth noting that\na few bona fide radio-loud NLS1s have been identified in the\nliterature (Siebert et al. 1999; Oshlack et al. 2001; Zhou et al.\n2003, 2005; see also Maccarone et al. 2005). As discussed by\nZhou et al. (2003, 2005), this is not entirely unexpected, since\nNLS1s are unlikely to be a homogeneous class. To the extent\nthat the broad-line region, or at least the portion emitting H\u03b2,\nmay have a disklike geometry, it seems unavoidable that some\nNLS1s must be sources with intrinsically large velocity dispersions viewed preferentially face-on as opposed to having low\n\n\fRadio-quiet AGNs\nMBH (see also Bian & Zhao 2004). Perhaps more baffling is\nwhy such a small fraction of NLS1s are radio-loud as compared\nto the general quasar population.\n\n4. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION\n\nThis is the first high-resolution radio study of a uniformly selected sample of AGNs with low mass and high Eddington ratio. As a class, these objects are radio-quiet down to very strong\nlimits. Our observations thus provide new support for a model\nin which radio-loudness is anti-correlated with Lbol /LEdd , as\nproposed, for example, by Ho (2002).\nAGNs at the lowest Lbol /LEdd are observed to be generically radio-loud (Ho 1999, 2002, 2005). At low Lbol /LEdd the\nconventional optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) is replaced by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF; Quataert 2001; Narayan 2005 and\nreferences therein). The RIAF itself efficiently produces radio\nemission while simultaneously lacking the optical-ultraviolet\nthermal emission from the standard accretion disk, which acts\nto boost R (Rees et al. 1982; Quataert et al. 1999; Ho et al. 2000;\nHo 2002). At the same time, it has been shown in many cases\nthat a RIAF alone cannot account for all of the observed radio\nemission, suggesting that an additional radio-emitting component, most likely associated with a jet, is required (Yi & Boughn\n1999; Ulvestad & Ho 2001b; Yuan et al. 2002; Anderson et al.\n2004; Falcke et al. 2004). On the opposite extreme, NLS1s,\nprobably high-Lbol /LEdd systems as discussed above, are systematically radio-quiet (although radio-loud quasars are exceptions; see below). Broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars are also\npredominantly radio-quiet (Stocke et al. 1992; cf. Becker et\nal. 2000), and at least a subset of them (the low-ionization\nsubclass) are thought to be radiating at high Lbol /LEdd (Meier\n1996; Boroson 2002). Principal component analysis of AGNs\nhas identified radio-quietness as a property that is statistically\nlinked with strong Fe II emission and weak [O III] lines, a family of properties, common to NLS1s and BAL quasars, that is\nthought to correspond to high-Lbol /LEdd systems (Boroson &\nGreen 1992; Marziani et al. 2001, 2003; Boroson 2002).\nThe trend of decreasing R with increasing Lbol /LEdd is shown\ngraphically in Figure 3 (cf. Fig. 5b in Ho 2002), using a representative sample of AGNs with radio and optical luminosities\nand BH mass estimates. To extend the dynamic range in the\nplot, we have augmented the sample from this study with (1)\nthe z < 0.5 PG quasars from Boroson & Green (1992) for which\nwe can estimate virial BH masses and (2) a sample of lowluminosity nuclei with BH masses derived from direct dynamical modeling (Ho 2002). Following standard practice, we infer\nthe bolometric luminosity directly from the optical continuum\nluminosity by assuming a fixed bolometric correction (see, e.g.,\ndiscussion in Greene & Ho 2004). In low-luminosity sources\nlacking reliable measurements of the optical AGN continuum,\nHo (2002) makes use of an additional empirical correlation between H\u03b2 and continuum luminosity (Ho & Peng 2001). Our\nupper limits on R, and in particular the stronger limit derived\nfrom our stacking analysis (large crossed box in Fig. 3), are\nconsistent with the observed trend, given the Lbol /LEdd distribution of the sample. To properly sample the low-mass regime,\nwe should include objects at low Lbol /LEdd as well. While these\nsources are intrinsically faint even when radiating at their Eddington luminosities, and thus difficult to find, one example\n\n5\n\nis known. NGC 4395, with MBH \u2248 104 \u2212 105 M\u2299 , is believed\nto have a Lbol /LEdd \u2248 0.01 (Filippenko & Ho 2003). It has R\n\u2248 2.0, which is significantly higher than our stacked upper limit\n(R = 0.27), and consistent with the trend delineated in Figure 3.\nThus, the inverse correlation between radio-loudness and accretion rate (Lbol /LEdd ) previously reported for supermassive BHs\n(106 to few\u00d7109 M\u2299 ) appears to continue to hold in the mass\nregime 104 \u2212 106 M\u2299 .\nTo aid us in the physical interpretation of these results, we\nturn to X-ray binaries (XRBs) that host BHs with MBH <10\n\u223c\nM\u2299 . Because the lower BH masses result in faster dynamical\ntimescales, it is possible to observe a single XRB in different\naccretion modes and link them directly with changes in spectral properties. XRBs are in fact found to occupy certain characteristic X-ray spectral states (see McClintock & Remillard\n2005 for a review) corresponding to different accretion regimes.\nTypically, at low X-ray luminosity, during which the accretion\nflow is thought to transform into a quasi-spherical RIAF radi(Esin et al. 1997), the spectrum is nonating at Lbol /LEdd <0.01\n\u223c\nthermal and hard (the \"low/hard\" state). This state is usually\naccompanied by persistent, flat-spectrum radio emission, correlated with the X-ray emission and likely including a jet component (e.g., Dhawan et al. 2000; Stirling et al. 2001; Corbel\net al. 2003; Fender & Belloni 2004). At higher X-ray lumia conventional optically thick,\nnosities (0.01 <\n\u223c\n\u223c Lbol /LEdd <0.3),\ngeometrically thin disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) produces\na spectrum dominated by thermal, soft X-ray emission (the\n\"high/soft\" state), during which the radio emission is quenched\n(Tananbaum et al. 1972; Fender et al. 1999, 2004; Gallo et al.\n2003; Tigelaar et al. 2004). Finally, for systems with the highin which the accretion flow\nest luminosities (Lbol /LEdd >0.3),\n\u223c\nmight take the form of a radiation pressure-dominated slim disk\n(Abramowicz et al. 1988), the X-ray spectrum can be dominated by a very steep power-law component (the \"very-high\"\nor \"SPL\" state). The very-high state itself is radio-quiet, but\ntransitions from the very-high to the high state may be accompanied by optically thin ejection events in the radio (e.g., Corbel\net al. 2001; Hannikainen et al. 2001; Fender et al. 2004).\nSince jet physics is basically scale-free (Heinz & Sunyaev\n2003), a number of authors have drawn a direct analogy between the spectral states of XRBs and AGNs (e.g., Meier 2001;\nMaccarone et al. 2003; Merloni et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004;\nJester 2005). The most thorough comparison has been made\nfor low-luminosity AGNs, whose characteristic radio-loudness,\nhard X-ray spectra, and radiative inefficiency bear close resemblance to the properties of XRBs in their low/hard state (Ho\n2005). The RIAF at low accretion rates may be particularly\nconducive to jet production because its vertical thickness supports a strong poloidal magnetic field (Meier 2001), in addition\nto providing a population of weakly bound or unbound particles that are unstable toward outflow (Blandford & Begelman\n1999).\nExtending the comparison to the high and very-high states,\nhowever, presents a greater challenge. This is in part due to the\nsomewhat nebulous luminosity criterion various authors use to\ndifferentiate the high state from the very-high state, and to the\nfact that the current estimates of bolometric luminosities and\nBH masses in AGNs are still rather uncertain. NLS1s, with\ntheir characteristically soft X-ray spectra, are often thought\nto be the direct analog of XRBs in the high state (Pounds et\nal. 1995). On the other hand, many NLS1s (e.g., Collin &\nKawaguchi 2004), though certainly not all (e.g., NGC 4395),\n\n\f6\n\nGREENE, HO, & ULVESTAD\n\nF IG . 3.- The trend of decreasing R with increasing Lbol /LEdd . The upper limits from this study are shown as triangles, GH10 is shown with a cross, and our\nstacked upper limit is plotted as the boxed cross. NGC 4395 is highlighted with a semifilled circle. For comparison, we include the 87 PG quasars with z < 0.5,\nusing radio continuum data from Kellermann et al. (1989) and optical continuum data from Neugebauer et al. (1987). We obtained BH masses with the method of\nKaspi et al. (2000) using FWHMH\u03b2 from Boroson & Green (1992), and we estimated Lbol following Ho (2002). PG objects with FWHMH\u03b2 < 2000 km s\u22121 (NLS1s)\nare boxed; they have a mean R of 0.54. The data for the low-Lbol /LEdd objects come from Ho (2002), as does the overplotted best-fit line. Inset: Our current sample\nshown on an expanded scale for clarity. Top histogram: The solid-line histogram plots the distribution of Lbol /LEdd for all the objects shown for comparison; the\ndash-dot histogram highlights the 19 objects from this study. Right histogram: Same format as above, but for the distribution of R. Note that all but one of the\nobjects in the solid histogram are upper limits. Upper limits in R for the PG objects are shown with a shaded histogram.\n\nevidently have Eddington ratios-when taken at face value-\nthat exceed 0.3, the formal upper limit for the stability of a\nShakura & Sunyaev disk. If we take this theoretically motivated\ncriterion as a definition for the very-high state, then most wellstudied NLS1s, including the sample of Greene & Ho (2004)\nhighlighted here, would technically qualify as being in the veryhigh state, rather than in the high state. Regardless of which\nchoice one adopts for NLS1s, our study emphasizes a distinctive feature of NLS1s as a class: they appear to be abnormally\nradio-quiet. If the currently estimated bolometric luminosities\nand BH masses are robust, the implication is that jet production\nin AGNs is suppressed when their Eddington ratios approach or\nexceed 1. This empirical result for NLS1s is consistent with the\ntendency for radio emission to be quenched in XRBs in their\nhigh and very-high states. The quenching of radio emission in\n\nthe high state may be related to the weakness of the poloidal\ncomponent of the magnetic field, central to driving a jet, in a\ngeometrically thin disk (Livio et al. 1999; Meier 2001). As\nmentioned above, XRBs undergoing very-high state transitions\noften exhibit rapid radio flares, perhaps generated from the relativistic ejection of the corona as the optically thick accretion\ndisk moves inward (Fender et al. 2004). Since the general\nquasar population is thought to radiate at high Lbol /LEdd , it has\nbeen suggested that the radio-loud quasar population consists of\nobjects that have recently undergone a state transition involving\na relativistic ejection event (Marscher et al. 2002; Gallo et al.\n2003; Jester 2005). In that case, it is puzzling that NLS1s have\nsuch a low fraction (0%\u20136%) of radio-loud objects as compared\nto quasars (10%\u201320%). BAL quasars are similar in this respect\n(e.g., Stocke et al. 1992). Apparently at the highest accretion\n\n\fRadio-quiet AGNs\nrates, even relativistic ejection events are uncommon. This result warrants further theoretical exploration.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nWe present a high-resolution study of radio emission from a\nwell-defined sample of low-mass active galaxies radiating at a\nhigh fraction of their Eddington luminosity (Lbol /LEdd ). Only\na single object (GH10) in our sample of 19 is detected, with a\nradio power of 8.5 \u00d71021 W Hz\u22121 , while we place 3 \u03c3 upper\nlimits of 3 \u00d7 1020 to 8 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 for the nondetections.\nAll the objects have very low ratios of radio to optical flux (R).\nGH10 has an R of 2.8, and a stacked image of the remaining observations provides an upper limit of R \u2264 0.27. While this study\nrepresents one of the few deep, high-resolution radio surveys of\na uniform sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), a\nreview of the literature reveals that NLS1s are generically radioquiet. In contrast, low-Lbol /LEdd sources are ubiquitously radioloud. Therefore, our observations provide renewed support for\nan inverse relation between Lbol /LEdd and radio-loudness. Fur-\n\n7\n\nther support for this picture is provided by black holes in X-ray\nbinaries (XRBs), whose radio emission is quenched when they\nradiate at high (\u2265 0.01) fractions of their Eddington luminosity. This same analogy has been used to suggest that radio-loud\nquasars may be undergoing a relativistic ejection event similar to those observed when XRBs transition from the very-high\nstate. In that case, it is quite intriguing that objects at the highest\naccretion rates, namely NLS1s and BAL quasars, have abnormally low radio-loud fractions, a finding for which we currently\nhave no clear explanation.\nWe are grateful for useful discussions with J.
