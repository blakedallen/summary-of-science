We prove that, with probability\none, the Hausdorff dimension of \u03b3 is equal to Min(2, 1 + \u03ba/8).\n\nIntroduction. It has been conjectured by theoretical physicists that various lattice models in statistical physics (such as percolation, Potts model,\nIsing model, uniform spanning trees), taken at their critical point, have a\ncontinuous conformally invariant scaling limit when the mesh of the lattice\ntends to 0. Recently, Oded Schramm [15] introduced a family of random\nprocesses which he called Stochastic Loewner Evolutions (or SLE), that are\nthe only possible conformally invariant scaling limits of random cluster interfaces (which are very closely related to all above-mentioned models).\nAn SLE process is defined using the usual Loewner equation, where the\ndriving function is a time-changed Brownian motion. More specifically, in\nthe present paper we will be mainly concerned with SLE in the upper-half\nplane (sometimes called chordal SLE), defined by the following PDE:\n(0.1)\n\n\u2202t gt (z) =\n\n2\n\u221a\n,\ngt (z) \u2212 \u03baBt\n\ng0 (z) = z,\n\nwhere (Bt ) is a standard Brownian motion on the real line and \u03ba is a positive parameter. It can be shown that this equation defines a family (gt ) of\nconformal mappings from simply connected domains (Ht ) contained in the\nupper-half plane, onto H. We shall denote by Kt the closure of the complement of Ht in H: then for all t > 0, Kt is a compact subset of H and the\nfamily (Kt ) is increasing. For each value \u03ba > 0, this defines a random process\ndenoted by SLE\u03ba (see, e.g., [14] for more details on SLE).\nThere are very few cases where convergence of a discrete model to SLE\u03ba\nis proved: Smirnov [17] (see also the related work of Camia and Newman [3])\nReceived June 2007; revised August 2007.\nAMS 2000 subject classifications. 60D05, 60G17, 28A80.\nKey words and phrases. SLE, Hausdorff dimension.\n\nThis is an electronic reprint of the original article published by the\nInstitute of Mathematical Statistics in The Annals of Probability,\n2008, Vol. 36, No. 4, 1421\u20131452. This reprint differs from the original in\npagination and typographic detail.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nshowed that SLE6 is the scaling limit of critical site percolation interfaces\non the triangular grid, and Lawler, Schramm and Werner [12] have proved\nthat SLE2 and SLE8 are the respective scaling limits of planar loop-erased\nrandom walks and uniform Peano curves. Convergence of the \"harmonic\nexplorer\" was obtained by Schramm and Sheffield [16], and there is also\nstrong evidence [13] that the infinite self-avoiding walk in the half-plane is\nrelated to SLE8/3 .\nIt is natural to study the geometry of SLE\u03ba , and in particular, its dependence on \u03ba. It is known (cf. [12, 14]) that, for each \u03ba > 0, the process (Kt )\nis generated by a random curve \u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H (called the trace of the SLE\nor the SLE curve), in the following sense: For each t > 0, Ht is the unique\nunbounded connected component of H \\ \u03b3([0, t]). Furthermore (see [14]), \u03b3\nis a simple curve when \u03ba \u2264 4, and it is a space-filling curve when \u03ba \u2265 8. The\ngeometry of this curve will be our main object of interest in the present\npaper.\nIt is possible, for each z \u2208 H, to evaluate the asymptotics when \u03b5 \u2192 0 of\nthe probability that \u03b3 intersects the disk of radius \u03b5 around z. When \u03ba < 8,\nthis probability decays like \u03b5s for some s = s(\u03ba) > 0. This (loosely speaking)\nshows that the expected number of balls of radius \u03b5 needed to cover \u03b3([0, 1])\n(say) is of the order of \u03b5s\u22122 , and implies that the Hausdorff dimension of \u03b3\nis not larger than 2 \u2212 s. Rohde and Schramm [14] used this strategy to show\nthat almost surely the Hausdorff dimension of the SLE\u03ba trace is not larger\nthan 1 + \u03ba/8 when \u03ba \u2264 8, and they conjectured that this bound was sharp.\nOur main result in the present paper is the proof of this conjecture,\nnamely:\nTheorem. Let (Kt ) be an SLE\u03ba in the upper-half plane with \u03ba > 0, let\n\u03b3 be its trace and let H := \u03b3([0, \u221e)). Then, almost surely,\n\u03ba\n.\ndimH (H) = 2 \u2227 1 +\n8\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nThis result was known for \u03ba \u2265 8 (because the curve is then space-filling),\n\u03ba = 6 (see [2], recall that this corresponds to the scaling limit of critical percolation clusters) and \u03ba = 8/3 (this follows from the description of the outer\nfrontier of SLE6 -or planar Brownian motion-in terms of SLE8/3 in [11],\nand the determination of the dimension of this boundary, see [8, 9]). Note\nthat in both these special cases, the models have a lot of independence built\nin (the Markov property of planar Brownian motion, the locality property\nof SLE6 ), and that the proofs use it in a fundamental way.\nSLE2 is the scaling limit (see [12]) of the two-dimensional loop-erased\nwalk: Hence, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of this scaling limit\nis 5/4, that is, it is equal to the growth exponent of the loop-erased walk\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n3\n\n(obtained by Kenyon, cf. [6]) and, at least heuristically, this is not surprising.\nIt is not known whether Kenyon's result can be derived using SLE methods.\nThis exponent s and various other exponents describing exceptional subsets of \u03b3 are closely related to critical exponents that describe the behavior\nnear the critical point of some functionals of the corresponding statistical\nphysics model. The value of the exponents 1 + \u03ba/8 appear in the theoretical\nphysics literature (see, e.g., [4] for a derivation based on quantum gravity,\nand the references therein) in terms of the central charge of the model. Let\nus stress that in the physics literature, the derivation of the exponent is often\nannounced in terms of (almost sure) fractal dimension, thereby omitting to\nprove the lower bound on the dimension. It might a priori be the case that\nthe value \u03b5s\u22122 is due to exceptional realizations of SLE\u03ba with exceptionally\nmany visited balls of radius \u03b5, while \"typical\" realizations of SLE\u03ba meet far\nfewer disks, in which case the dimension of the curve could be smaller than\n2 \u2212 s.\nOne standard way to exclude such a possibility and to prove that 2 \u2212 s\ncorresponds to the almost sure dimension of a random fractal is to estimate\nthe variance of the number of \u03b5-disks needed to cover it. This amounts to\ncomputing second moments, that is, given two balls of radius \u03b5, to estimating\nthe probability that the SLE trace intersects both of them-and this is the\nhairy part of the proof, especially if there is a long-range dependence in the\nmodel. One also needs another nontrivial ingredient: One has to evaluate\nprecisely (i.e., up to multiplicative constants) the probability of intersecting\none ball. Even in the Brownian case (see, e.g., [10]), this is not an easy task.\nNote that the discrete counterpart of our theorem in the cases \u03ba = 6 and\n\u03ba = 2 is still an open problem. It is known that for critical percolation interfaces (see [18]) and for loop-erased random walks [6], the expected number\nof steps grows in the appropriate way when the mesh of the lattice goes to\nzero, but its almost sure behavior is not yet well-understood: For critical\npercolation, the up-to-constant estimate of the first moment is missing, and\nfor loop-erased random walks, we lack the second moment estimate.\nAnother natural object is the boundary of an SLE, namely, \u2202Kt \u2229 H.\nFor \u03ba \u2264 4, since \u03b3 is a simple curve, the boundary of the SLE is the SLE\nitself; for \u03ba > 4, it is a strict subset of the trace, and it is conjectured to\nbe closely related to the curve of an SLE16/\u03ba (this is called SLE duality)-\nin particular, it should have dimension 1 + 2/\u03ba. Again, the first moment\nestimate is known for all \u03ba (though not up to constants), and yields the\nupper bound on the dimension. The lower bound is known to hold for \u03ba =\n6 (see [8]). A consequence of our main theorem is that it also holds for\n\u03ba = 8, because of the continuous counterpart of the duality between uniform\nspanning trees and loop-erased random walks (which is the basis of Wilson's\nalgorithm, cf. [19]).\n\n\f4\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nThe derivation of the lower bound on the dimension relies on the construction of a random Frostman measure \u03bc supported on the curve. It appears\nthat the properties of this measure are closely related to some of those exhibited by conformal fields-more specifically, the correlations between the\nmeasures of disjoint subsets of H behave similarly to the (conjectured) correlation functions in conformal field theory. See, for instance, Friedrich and\nWerner [5].\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In the first section we review some\nfacts that can be found in our previous paper ([2]) and that we will need\nlater. Section 2 is devoted to the derivation of the up-to-constants estimate\nof the first moment of the number of disks needed to cover the curve. In\nSection 3 we will derive the upper bound on the second moment, which\nwill conclude the proof of the main theorem. In the final sections we will\ncomment on the properties of the Frostman measure supported on the SLE\ncurve and on the dimension of the outer boundary of SLE8 .\n1. Preliminaries. As customary, the Hausdorff dimension of the random\nfractal curve \u03b3 will be determined using first and second moments estimates.\nThis framework was also used in [2]. We now briefly recall without proofs\nsome tools from that paper that we will use. The following proposition is\nthe continuous version of a similar discrete construction due to Lawler (cf.\n[7]).\nLet \u03bb be the Lebesgue measure in [0, 1]2 , and (C\u03b5 )\u03b5>0 be a family of\nrandom Borel subsets of the square [0, 1]2 . Assume that for \u03b5 < \u03b5\u2032 we have\nalmost surely C\u03b5 \u2286 C\u03b5\u2032 , and let C = \u2229C\u03b5 . Finally, let s be a nonnegative real\nnumber. Introduce the following conditions:\n1. For all x \u2208 [0, 1]2 ,\n\nP (x \u2208 C\u03b5 ) \u224d \u03b5s\n\n(where the symbol \u224d means that the ratio between both sides of the\nexpression is bounded above and below by finite positive constants);\n2. There exists c > 0 such that, for all x \u2208 [0, 1]2 and \u03b5 > 0,\nP (\u03bb(C\u03b5 \u2229 B(x, \u03b5)) > c\u03b52 |x \u2208 C\u03b5 ) \u2265 c > 0;\n\n3. There exists c > 0 such that, for all x, y \u2208 [0, 1]2 and \u03b5 > 0,\nP ({x, y} \u2282 C\u03b5 ) \u2264 c\u03b52s |x \u2212 y|\u2212s .\n\nProposition 1.\n\nWith the previous notation:\n\n1. If conditions 1 and 2 hold, then a.s. dimH (C) \u2264 d \u2212 s;\n2. If conditions 1 and 3 hold, then with positive probability dimH (C) \u2265 d\u2212 s.\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n5\n\nRemark. The similar proposition which can be found in [7] is stated in\na discrete setup in which condition 2 does not appear. Indeed, in most cases,\nthis condition is a direct consequence of condition 1 and the definition of C\u03b5\n(e.g., if C\u03b5 is a union of balls of radius \u03b5 as will be the case here).\nThe value of the exponent in condition 1 is usually given in terms of the\nprincipal eigenvalue of a diffusion generator (cf. [1] for further reference).\nThe rule of thumb is as follows:\nLemma 2. Let (Xt ) be the diffusion on the interval [0, 1] generated by\nthe following stochastic differential equation:\ndXt = \u03c3 dBt + f (Xt ) dt,\nwhere (Bt ) is a standard real-valued Brownian motion, \u03c3 is a positive constant, and where f is a smooth function on the open unit interval satisfying\nsuitable conditions near the boundary. Let L be the generator of the diffusion,\ndefined by\nL\u03c6 =\n\n\u03c3 2 \u2032\u2032\n\u03c6 + f \u03c6\u2032 ,\n2\n\nand let \u03bb be its leading eigenvalue. Then, as t goes to infinity, the probability\npt that the diffusion is defined up to time t tends to 0 as\npt \u224d e\u2212\u03bbt .\nWe voluntarily do not state the conditions satisfied by f in detail here\n(roughly, f needs to make both 0 and 1 absorbing boundaries, while being\nsteep enough to allow a spectral gap construction-cf. [2] for a more complete\nstatement), because we shall not use the lemma in this form in the present\npaper; we include it mainly for background reference.\nThe next two sections contain derivations of conditions 1 and 3; together\nwith Proposition 1, this implies that\n\u03ba\n> 0.\nP dimH H = 1 +\n8\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nThe main theorem then follows from the zero-one law derived in [2], namely:\nLemma 3 (0\u20131 law for the trace).\n\nFor all d \u2208 [0, 2], we have\n\nP (dimH H = d) \u2208 {0, 1}.\n\n\f6\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\n2. The first moment estimate. Fix \u03ba > 0 and z0 \u2208 H; let \u03b3 be the trace\nof a chordal SLE\u03ba in H, and let H = \u03b3([0, \u221e)) be the image of \u03b3. We want\nto compute the probability that H touches the disk B(z0 , \u03b5) for \u03b5 > 0.\nProposition 4. Let \u03b1(z0 ) \u2208 (0, \u03c0) be the argument of z0 . Then, if \u03ba \u2208\n(0, 8), we have the following estimate:\nP (B(z0 , \u03b5) \u2229 H =\n6 \u2205) \u224d\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b5\nI(z0 )\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03ba/8\n\n(sin \u03b1(z0 ))8/\u03ba\u22121 .\n\nIf \u03ba \u2265 8, then this probability is equal to 1 for all \u03b5 > 0.\nRemark. We know that H is a closed subset of H\u0304 (indeed, this is a\nconsequence of the transience of \u03b3-cf. [14]). For \u03ba \u2265 8, this proves that,\nfor all z \u2208 H\u0304, P (z \u2208 H) = 1, hence, H almost surely has full measure. And\nsince it is closed, this implies that, with probability 1, \u03b3 is space-filling, as\nwas already proved by Rohde and Schramm [14] for \u03ba > 8 and by Lawler,\nSchramm and Werner [12] for \u03ba = 8 (for which a separate proof is needed\nfor the existence of \u03b3).\nProof of Proposition 4. The idea of the following proof is originally\ndue to Oded Schramm. Let \u03b4t be the Euclidean distance between z0 and Kt .\n(\u03b4t ) is then a nonincreasing process, and its limit when t goes to +\u221e is the\ndistance between z0 and H. Besides, we can apply the K\u00f6be 1/4 theorem to\nthe map gt : this leads to the estimate\n(2.1)\n\n\u03b4t \u224d\n\nI(gt (z0 ))\n|gt\u2032 (z0 )|\n\n(where the implicit constants are universal-namely, 1/4 and 4).\nIt will be more convenient to fix the image of z0 under the random conformal map. Hence, introduce the following map:\ng\u0303t : z 7\u2192\n\ngt (z) \u2212 gt (z0 )\n.\ngt (z) \u2212 gt (z0 )\n\nIt is easy to see that g\u0303t maps H \\ Kt conformally onto the unit disk U, and\nmaps infinity to 1 and z0 to 0. In other words, the map\nw 7\u2192 g\u0303t\n\n\u0012\n\nwgt (z0 ) \u2212 gt (z0 )\nw\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nmaps the complement of some compact K\u0303t in U onto U, fixing 0 and 1 (in\nall this proof, z will stand for an element of H and w for an element of U).\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n7\n\nMoreover, in this setup equation (2.1) becomes simpler (because the distance\nbetween 0 and the unit circle is fixed): Namely,\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b4t \u224d\n\n1\n\n.\n|g\u0303t\u2032 (z0 )|\n\nDifferentiating g\u0303t (z) with respect to t (which is a little messy and errorprone, but straightforward) leads to the following differential equation:\n(2.3)\n\n\u2202t g\u0303t (z) =\n\n2(\u03b2\u0303t \u2212 1)3\n\u03b2\u0303t g\u0303t (z)(g\u0303t (z) \u2212 1)\n,\n*\n2\n2\n(gt (z0 ) \u2212 gt (z0 )) \u03b2\u0303t\ng\u0303t (z) \u2212 \u03b2\u0303t\n\nwhere (\u03b2\u0303t ) is the process on the unit circle defined by\n\u03b2\u0303t =\n\n\u03b2t \u2212 gt (z0 )\n.\n\u03b2t \u2212 gt (z0 )\n\nNow the structure of the expression for \u2202t g\u0303t (z) [equation (2.3)] is quite nice:\nThe first factor does not depend on z and the second one only depends on\nz0 through \u03b2\u0303. Hence, let us define a (random) time change by taking the\nreal part of the first factor; namely, let\nds =\n\n(\u03b2\u0303t \u2212 1)4\ndt,\n|gt (z0 ) \u2212 gt (z0 )|2 \u03b2\u0303t2\n\nand introduce hs = g\u0303t(s) .\nThen equation (2.3) becomes similar to a radial Loewner equation, that\nis, it can be written as\n(2.4)\n\n\u2202s hs (z) = X\u0303(\u03b2\u0303t(s) , hs (z)),\n\nwhere X\u0303 is the vector field in U defined as\n2\u03b6w(w \u2212 1)\n(2.5)\nX\u0303(\u03b6, w) =\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6)(w \u2212 \u03b6)\nThe only missing part is now the description of the driving process \u03b2\u0303.\nApplying It\u00f4's formula (now this is an ugly computation) and then the\nprevious time-change, we see that \u03b2\u0303t(s) can be written as exp(i\u03b1s ), where\n(\u03b1s ) is a diffusion process on the interval (0, 2\u03c0) satisfying the equation\n\u221a\n\u03ba\u22124\n\u03b1s\nd\u03b1s = \u03ba dBs +\n(2.6)\ncotg\nds\n2\n2\nwith the initial condition \u03b10 = 2\u03b1(z0 ).\nThe above construction is licit as long as z0 remains inside the domain of\ngt . While this holds, differentiating (2.4) with respect to z at z = z0 yields\n\u2202s h\u2032s (z0 ) =\n\n2h\u2032s (z0 )\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0303s\n\n\f8\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nso that dividing by h\u2032s (z0 ) 6= 0 and taking the real parts of both sides we get\n\u2202s log |h\u2032s (z0 )| = 1,\nthat is, almost surely, for all s > 0, |h\u2032s (z0 )| = |h\u20320 (z0 )|es . Combining this\nwith (2.2) shows that\n\u03b4t(s) \u224d \u03b40 e\u2212s \u224d I(z0 )e\u2212s .\nFinally, let us look at what happens at the stopping time\n\u03c4z0 = Inf{t : z0 \u2208 Kt }.\nWe are in one out of two situations: Either z0 is on the trace: in this case \u03b4t\ngoes to 0, meaning that s goes to \u221e, and the diffusion (\u03b1s ) does not touch\n{0, 2\u03c0}. Or, z0 is not on the trace: then \u03b4t tends to d(z0 , H) > 0, and the\ndiffusion (\u03b1s ) reaches the boundary of the interval (0, 2\u03c0) at time\ns0 := log \u03b40 \u2212 log d(z0 , H) + O(1).\nLet S be the surviving time of (\u03b1s ): the previous construction then shows\nthat\nd(z0 , H) \u224d \u03b40 e\u2212S ,\nand estimating the probability that z0 is \u03b5-close to the trace becomes equivalent to estimating the probability that (\u03b1s ) survives up to time log(\u03b40 /\u03b5).\nAssume for a moment that \u03ba > 4. The behavior of cotg \u03b1/2 when \u03b1 is\nclose to 0 shows that (\u03b1s ) can be compared to the diffusion (\u1fb1s ) generated\nby\nd\u1fb1s =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03ba dBs + (\u03ba \u2212 4)\n\nds\n,\n\u1fb1s\n\nwhich (up to a linear time-change) is a Bessel process of dimension\nd=\n\n3\u03ba \u2212 8\n.\n8\n\nMore precisely, (\u1fb1s ) survives almost surely, if and only if (\u03b1s ) survives almost\nsurely. But it is known that a Bessel process of dimension d survives almost\nsurely if d \u2265 2, and dies almost surely if d < 2. Hence, we already obtain the\nphase transition at \u03ba = 8:\n\u2022 If \u03ba \u2265 8, then d \u2265 2, and (\u03b1s ) survives almost surely. Hence, almost surely,\nd(z0 , H) = 0, and for all \u03b5 > 0, the trace will almost surely touch B(z0 , \u03b5).\n\u2022 If \u03ba < 8, then d < 2 and (\u03b1s ) dies almost surely in finite time. Hence,\nalmost surely, d(z0 , H) > 0.\n\n\f9\n\nTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\nSo, there is nothing left to prove for \u03ba \u2265 8. From now on, we shall then\nsuppose that \u03ba \u2208 (0, 8). If \u03ba \u2264 4, then the drift of (\u03b1s ) is toward the boundary,\nhence, comparing it to standard Brownian motion shows that it dies almost\nsurely in finite time as for \u03ba \u2208 (4, 8). We want to apply Lemma 2 to (\u03b1s )\nand for that we need to know the principal eigenvalue of the generator L\u03ba\nof the diffusion. It can be seen that the function\n(sin(x/2))8/\u03ba\u22121\nis a positive eigenfunction of L\u03ba , with eigenvalue 1 \u2212 \u03ba/8: hence, we already\nobtain that, if \u03b10 is far from the boundary, P (S > s) \u224d exp(\u2212(1 \u2212 \u03ba/8)s),\nthat is,\n\u03b5 1\u2212\u03ba/8\n,\n\u03b40\nwhich is the correct estimate. It remains to take the value of \u03b10 into account.\nIntroduce the following process:\nP (d(z0 , H) \u2264 \u03b5) \u224d e(1\u2212\u03ba/8) log(\u03b5/\u03b40 ) \u224d\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1s 8/\u03ba\u22121 (1\u2212\u03ba/8)s\ne\n2\n(and Xs = 0 if s \u2265 S). Applying the It\u00f4 formula shows that (Xs ) is a local\nmartingale [in fact, this is the same statement as saying that sin(x/2)8/\u03ba\u22121\nis an eigenfunction of the generator], and it is bounded on any bounded time\ninterval. Hence, taking the expected value of X at times 0 and s shows that\n\u0012\n\nXs := sin\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1s 8/\u03ba\u22121\n\u03b10 8/\u03ba\u22121\n= e(1\u2212\u03ba/8)s P (S \u2265 s)E sin\nS \u2265s .\n2\n2\nThe same proof as that of Lemma 2 shows that, for all s \u2265 1,\n(2.8)\n\nsin\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\nP (\u03b1s \u2208 [\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2]|S \u2265 s) > 0,\n\nwith constants depending only on \u03ba; combining this with (2.8) then provides\n\u03b10 8/\u03ba\u22121\n,\n2\nagain with constants depending only on \u03ba. Applying the same computation\nas for equation (2.7) ends the proof. \u0003\nP (S \u2265 s) \u224d e\u2212(1\u2212\u03ba/8)s sin\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nCorollary 5. Let D C be a simply connected domain, a and b be\ntwo points on the boundary of D, and \u03b3 be the path of a chordal SLE\u03ba in\nD from a to b, with \u03ba \u2208 (0, 8). Then, for all z \u2208 D and \u03b5 < d(z, \u2202D)/2, we\nhave\n\u0012\n\u00131\u2212\u03ba/8\n\u03b5\nP (\u03b3 \u2229 B(z, \u03b5) 6= \u2205) \u224d\n(\u03c9z (ab) \u2227 \u03c9z (ba))8/\u03ba\u22121 ,\nd(z, \u2202D)\nwhere \u03c9z is the harmonic measure on \u2202D seen from z and ab is the positively\noriented arc from a to b along \u2202D.\n\n\f10\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nProof. This is easily seen by considering a conformal map \u03a6 mapping\nD to the upper-half plane, a to 0 and b to \u221e: Since the harmonic measure\nfrom z in D is mapped to the harmonic measure from \u03a6(z) in H, it is\nsufficient to prove that, for all z \u2208 H,\n\u03c9z (R+ ) \u2227 \u03c9z (R\u2212 ) \u224d sin(arg z);\nand \u03c9z (R+ ) can be explicitly computed, because \u03c9z is a Cauchy distribution\non the real line:\n\u03c9x+iy (R+ ) =\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndu/y\n1 1\n= + arctg(x/y).\n2\n2\n1 + (u \u2212 x) /y\n2 \u03c0\n\nWhen x tends to \u2212\u221e, this behaves like \u2212y/\u03c0x, which is equivalent to\nsin(arg(x + iy))/\u03c0. \u0003\nThis \"intrinsic\" formulation of the hitting probability will make the derivation of the second moment estimate more readable.\n3. The second moment estimate. We still have to derive condition 3 in\nProposition 1. For \u03ba = 6, it was obtained using the locality property, but\nthis does not hold for other values of \u03ba, so we can rely only on the Markov\nproperty. In this whole section we shall assume that \u03ba < 8 (there is nothing\nto prove if \u03ba \u2265 8, since in that case \u03b3 is space-filling).\nThe general idea is as follows. Fix two points z and z \u2032 in the upper half\nplane, and \u03b5 < |z \u2032 \u2212 z|/2. We want to estimate the probability that the trace\n\u03b3 visits both B(z, \u03b5) and B(z \u2032 , \u03b5). Assume that it touches, say, the first one\n(which happens with probability of order \u03b51\u2212\u03ba/8 ), and that it does so before\ntouching the other.\nApply the Markov property at the first hitting time T\u03b5 (z) of B(z, \u03b5): If\neverything is going fine and we are lucky, the distance between z \u2032 and KT\u03b5 (z)\nwill still be of order |z \u2032 \u2212 z|. Hence, applying the first moment estimate to\nthis situation shows that the conditional probability that \u03b3 hits B(z \u2032 , \u03b5) is\nnot greater than C(\u03b5/|z \u2032 \u2212 z|)1\u2212\u03ba/8 [it might actually be much smaller, if the\nreal part of gT\u03b5 (z) (z \u2032 ) is large, but this is not a problem since we only need\nan upper bound], and this gives the right estimate for the second moments:\nC\n\n\u03b52\u2212\u03ba/4\n.\n|z \u2032 \u2212 z|1\u2212\u03ba/8\n\nThe whole point is then to prove that this is the main contribution to the\nsecond moment; the way we achieve it is by providing sufficiently sharp\nupper bounds for the second term of the estimate given by Corollary 5.\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\nFig. 1.\n\n11\n\nSecond moments: the setup.\n\n3.1. Preliminaries. The first part of the proof is a succession of topological lemmas which allow for a precise estimation of the harmonic measures of\nthe two sides of the SLE process. They are easier to state in the case \u03ba \u2264 4,\nfor which the process consists in a simple curve. In the case 4 < \u03ba < 8, what\nhappens is that a positive area is \"swallowed\" by the process; in all the following discussion, nothing changes as long as the points z and z \u2032 themselves\nare not swallowed, and the arguments are exactly the same-as all that is\nrequired for the proofs to apply is for the complement of the process to be\nsimply connected and contain both z and z \u2032 .\nOn the other hand, if (say) z is swallowed at a given time, at which the\ncurve has not touched C(z, \u03b5) yet, then this will never happen, so this event\ndoes not contribute at all to the probability of the event we are interested\nin. If the trace does touch C(z, \u03b5) before swallowing z, then the swallowing\noccurs at a time when it is not relevant anymore-since we know already that\nz is \u03b5-close to the path-so again the rest of the argument is not affected.\nIn order to simplify the exposition of the argument, we will implicitly\nassume that indeed \u03ba \u2264 4. The interested reader can easily check as she\nproceeds that what follows does apply to the other cases, with little change\nin the writing.\nLet z, z \u2032 be two points in the upper half plane, and let \u03b4 = |z \u2212 z \u2032 |/2. We\ncan assume that both Iz and Iz \u2032 are greater than 18\u03b4 (say). Introduce a\n\"separator set\" (cf. Figure 1):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\nz + z\u2032\nE =C\n, 2\u03b4 \u222a {w \u2208 H : d(w, z) = d(w, z \u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b4 5}.\n2\nAt each positive time t, the complement Ht of Kt in H is an open and\nsimply connected domain, hence, its intersection with E is the disjoint union\nof at most countably many connected sets, each separating Ht into two (or\nup to four for at most two of them) connected components. If both z and\n\n\f12\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nz \u2032 are in Ht , let Et be the union of those crosscuts which disconnect z from\nz \u2032 in Ht ; if either z or z \u2032 is in Kt , let Et = \u2205-notice that in the case of an\nSLE process with parameter \u03ba \u2264 4, this almost surely never happens. Note\nthat, as long as z and z \u2032 are in Ht , Et is not empty, because Ht is simply\nconnected and E itself disconnects z from z \u2032 . The components of Et can then\nbe ordered in the way they first appear on any path going from z to z \u2032 in\nHt ; let \u03bbt be the first one, and \u03bb\u2032t be the last one (which is also the first one\nseen from z \u2032 to z); for convenience, in the case Et = \u2205, let \u03bbt = \u03bb\u2032t = \u2205 too.\nFor each time t (possibly random), introduce\n(3.1)\n\nt\u0303 := Inf{s > t : Ks \u2229 \u03bb\u2032t 6= \u2205},\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u0165 := Inf{s > t : Ks \u2229 \u03bbt 6= \u2205},\n\nwith the usual convention that the infimum of the empty set is infinite.\nClearly, \u03c4\u0303 and \u03c4\u030c are stopping times if \u03c4 is one.\nBesides, Et does not change on any time-interval on which \u03b3 does not\nintersect E-hence, if for some t1 < t2 , \u03b3((t1 , t2 )) \u2229 E = \u2205, we can define\nEt2 \u2212 as its constant value on the interval (t1 , t2 ) (i.e., as Et1 ). We say that a\npositive stopping time t is a good time if the following conditions are satisfied\nwith probability 1:\n\u2022 There exists s < t such that \u03b3((s, t)) \u2229 E = \u2205;\n\u2022 \u03b3(t) \u2208 Et\u2212 .\nExamples of good times are t\u0303 and \u0165 when t is a stopping time such that\n\u03b3(t) \u2208\n/ E holds with probability 1.\nWe first give two preliminary lemmas which will be useful in estimating\nthe harmonic measures appearing in the statement of Corollary 5. They are\nnot specific to SLE, but they depend (as stated) on the fact that \u03b3 is a\nsimple curve which does not contain z nor z \u2032 (as is the case with probability\n1 in the case \u03ba \u2264 4); they have obvious counterparts obtained by exchanging\nz and z \u2032 and replacing everywhere t\u0303 with \u0165.\nFor each positive time, let \u03c9t (resp. \u03c9t\u2032 ) be the smaller of the harmonic\nmeasures of the two sides of \u03b3, from z (resp. z \u2032 ) in Ht -this corresponds to\nthe term we want to estimate in the statement of Corollary 5. (Here and\nin all the sequel, as is natural, we include the positive real axis in the right\nside of \u03b3 and the negative real axis in its left side.) Besides, for t > 0 and\n\u03c1 \u2208 (0, \u03b4), let Bt (\u03c1) [resp. Bt\u2032 (\u03c1)] be the closure of the connected component\nof z (resp. z \u2032 ) in B(z, \u03c1) \u2229 Ht [resp. B(z \u2032 , \u03c1) \u2229 Ht ].\nIn all that follows we will use the following notation at each time t > 0\n(together with their counterparts around z \u2032 ):\nrt := d(z, \u03b3([0, t]) \u222a R);\n\n\u03c1t := Inf{\u03c1 \u2208 (0, \u03b4) : Bt (\u03c1) disconnects z \u2032 from \u221e in Ht }\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\nFig. 2.\n\n13\n\nProof of Lemma 6.\n\n(letting \u03c1t = \u03b4 if the infimum is taken over an empty set). Obviously (rt )\nis nonincreasing; but (\u03c1t ) is not in general. Besides, \u03c1t \u2265 rt . Last, since the\nsets Bt (\u03c1) and \u03b3([0, t]) are all compact, it is easy to see that at each time t\nsuch that \u03c1t < \u03b4, \u03b3([0, t]) \u222a Bt (\u03c1t ) itself does disconnect z \u2032 from infinity.\nLemma 6. There exists a positive constant c such that the following happens. Let t be a good time, and \u03c1 \u2208 (rt , \u03b4). If \u03c9t \u2265 c(rt /\u03c1)1/2 , then \u03b3([0, t]) \u222a\nBt (\u03c1) disconnects z \u2032 from infinity; in particular, \u03c1t \u2264 \u03c1.\nProof. First make the following remark: For \u03c1 \u2208 (rt , \u03b4), if the harmonic\nmeasure from z in Bt (\u03c1) \\ \u03b3([0, t]) gives positive mass to both sides of \u03b3, then\nBt (\u03c1) separates z \u2032 from infinity in Ht (see Figure 2).\nIndeed, assume that we are this case. That means that there exist two disjoint smooth curves \u03b61 , \u03b62 : [0, 1] \u2192 H satisfying \u03b61 (0) = \u03b62 (0) = z, \u03b6i ((0, 1)) \u2282\nBt (\u03c1) \\ \u03b3([0, t]) and \u03b6i (1) \u2208 \u03b3([0, t]), each landing on a different side of \u03b3 [i.e.,\nlims\u21921 gt (\u03b61 (s)) \u2212 \u03b2t \u2208 (0, +\u221e) and lims\u21921 gt (\u03b62 (s)) \u2212 \u03b2t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0)-note\nthat such limits are always welldefined because gt extends continuously to\nthe boundary of Ht ]. Let \u03b6 = \u03b61 ((0, 1)) \u222a \u03b62 ((0, 1)) \u222a {z} be the corresponding\ncross-cut: The complement of \u03b6 in Ht has exactly two (simply) connected\ncomponents, one of which is unbounded.\n\n\f14\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nIf \u03b3(t) were on the boundary of the unbounded component, then one\ncould continue \u03b3([0, t]) with some curve \u03b3\u0302 contained in Ht \\ \u03b6 and tending\nto infinity. Then the bounded component of Ht \\ \u03b6 would be contained in\none of the components of H \\ (\u03b3([0, t]) \u222a \u03b3\u0302), hence, its boundary (which\ncontains both endpoints of \u03b6) would intersect only one side of \u03b3-which is\nin contradiction with our hypothesis.\nNow if z \u2032 were in the unbounded component, it would be possible to join\nz to z \u2032 inside the unbounded component. But such a path would have to\nintersect the part of Et\u2212 which contains \u03b3(t) (by the definition of Et\u2212 and\nthat of a good time), and it does not because this part of Et is contained in\nthe connected component of Ht \\ \u03b6 which contains \u03b3(t) on its boundary-\nthat is, the bounded one.\nTo sum it up, \u03b3([0, t]) \u222a \u03b6 cuts Ht into two connected components, and\nthe bounded component contains z \u2032 in its interior and \u03b3(t) on its boundary.\nIn particular, since \u03b6 is contained in Bt (\u03c1), this implies that Bt (\u03c1) separates\nz \u2032 from infinity in Ht .\nIt is then straightforward to complete the proof of the lemma, by applying\nBeurling's estimate in Bt (\u03c1) and the maximum principle. \u0003\nWe will actually use the converse of this lemma: At any good time t, we\nhave\n(3.3)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9t \u2264 c\n\nrt\n\u03c1t\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\nA related fact is the following:\nLemma 7. Let r \u2208 (0, \u03b4), T be the first time when \u03b3 hits the circle C(z, r)\nand T\u0303 as introduced above [see equation (3.1)]. If T\u0303 if finite, then BT\u0303 (r) does\nnot disconnect z \u2032 from infinity in HT\u0303 .\nProof. Let \u03b6 be a continuous, simple curve going from z \u2032 to infinity\nin HT\u0303 , and let C be the connected component of HT \\ E which contains\nz \u2032 . It is always possible to ensure that \u03b6 intersect every component of ET\u0303\nat most once. The boundary of C is contained in \u03b3([0, T ]) \u222a \u03bb\u2032T ; and since\n\u03b3([0, T ]) \u2229 E is not empty [because E separates C(z, r) from 0], necessarily\n\u03b3([0, T ])\u2229 \u03bb\u0304\u2032T 6= \u2205. In particular, HT \\(\u03b6 \u222a C \u222a \u03bb\u2032T ) has exactly two unbounded\nconnected components, say, U1 and U2 .\nAssume that BT\u0303 (r) does disconnect z \u2032 from infinity. Then \u03b6 has to intersect its interior, splitting it into at most countably many connected components. \u03b3([0, T\u0303 ]) has to intersect at least one component on each side of \u03b6,\nsince if not one could deform \u03b6 so that it avoids BT\u0303 (r)-but by the definition\nof T , \u03b3([0, T ]) intersects only the adherence of one component, say, on the\nleft of \u03b6. By construction, the only way for \u03b3 to reach a component on the\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n15\n\nother side of \u03b6 is by intersecting C and hence \u03bb\u2032T , so it cannot happen before\ntime T\u0303 . \u0003\nIn other words, if T is the first time when \u03b3 intersects C(z, r) and \u03c4 is\nthe first time t such that \u03c1t \u2264 r, then assuming that \u03c4 is finite, we have\nT < T\u0303 < \u03c4 .\nThe last lemma in this section is specific to SLE: It is a quantitative\nversion of the transience of the curve \u03b3 and basically says that if \u03b3 forms\na fjord, then it is not likely to enter it. With the modifications of notation\ndescribed later for the case 4 < \u03ba < 8, it holds also in that case, and the\nproof is the same.\nLemma 8. Let \u03b3 be the trace of an SLE with parameter \u03ba \u2264 4; then there\nexist positive constants C and \u03b7 such that the following happens. Let \u03c1 > 0\nand let \u03c4 be the first time t such that \u03c1t \u2264 \u03c1 (i.e., such that \u03b3([0, t]) \u222a Bt (\u03c1)\ndisconnects z \u2032 from infinity). \u03c4 is finite with positive probability, in which\ncase we have |\u03b3\u03c4 \u2212 z| = \u03c1, and:\n1. P (\u03c4\u0303 < \u221e|F\u03c4 , \u03c4 < \u221e) \u2264 C(\u03c1/\u03b4)\u03b7 ;\n2. For every r < r\u03c4 ,\n\nP (\u03c4\u0303 < \u221e, r\u03c4\u0303 < r|F\u03c4 , \u03c4 < \u221e) \u2264 C(r/r\u03c4 )1\u2212\u03ba/8 (\u03c1/\u03b4)\u03b7 .\nProof. (i) In all this proof c will denote any finite positive constant\nwhich depends only on \u03ba. Notice that if z \u2032 \u2208 K\u03c4 (which can happen if \u03ba > 4),\nthere is nothing to prove, since \u03c4\u0303 = \u221e in this case; so we assume from now\non that z \u2032 \u2208\n/ K\u03c4 . Recall that \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 is the last component of E\u03c4 that one has to\ncross when going from z to z \u2032 in H\u03c4 . By monotonicity, the extremal distance\n1\nlog(\u03b4/\u03c1)-and hence so\nbetween E and B\u03c4 (\u03c1) in H\u03c4 is bounded below by 2\u03c0\n\u2032\nis the extremal distance between \u03bb\u03c4 and B\u03c4 (\u03c1).\nBy the definition of \u03c4 , it is possible to find a simple continuous curve\n\u03b6 going from z \u2032 to \u221e in (H\u03c4 \\ B\u03c4 (\u03c1)) \u222a {\u03b3\u03c4 } (e.g., by using the fact that\n\u03b3([0, \u03c4 \u2212 s]) \u222a B\u03c4 (\u03c1) does not separate z \u2032 from \u221e for s > 0, choosing \u03b6 s\naccordingly, and letting s go to 0); and there exists a simple continuous\ncurve \u03b6 \u2032 going from z to \u03b3\u03c4 in B\u03c4 (\u03c1) (see Figure 3). Considering these curves,\nit is easy to see that \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 disconnects z \u2032 , and not z, from infinity in H\u03c4 .\nThe construction also shows that |\u03b3\u03c4 \u2212 z| \u2264 \u03c1: Indeed, if not then, we can\ndeform \u03b6 locally around \u03b3\u03c4 to obtain a continuous curve going from z \u2032 to\ninfinity without hitting \u03b3([0, \u03c4 ]) \u222a B\u03c4 (\u03c1), which is in contradiction with the\ndefinition of \u03c4 . If on the other hand we had |\u03b3\u03c4 \u2212 z| < \u03c1, then for s < \u03c4 large\nenough, Bs (\u03c1) \u222a \u03b3([0, s]) would still disconnect z \u2032 from infinity, also leading\nto a contradiction-hence, |\u03b3\u03c4 \u2212 z| = \u03c1.\n\n\f16\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nFig. 3.\n\nFig. 4.\n\nProof of Lemma 8: Setup.\n\nProof of Lemma 8: After mapping by \u03c6.\n\nMap the whole picture by \u03c6 := g\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c4 . B\u03c4 (\u03c1) is mapped to a cross-cut\nhaving 0 on its closure, and the images of \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 and z \u2032 are in a bounded\n\n\f17\n\nTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\nconnected component of its complement (cf. Figure 4). The boundary of\nthe unbounded component of the complement of \u03c6(B\u03c4 (\u03c1)) contains either\n(\u2212\u221e, 0) or (0, \u221e); for ease of notation, we assume that the former holds, as\nin the figure.\nBy conformal invariance, the extremal distance in H between \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) and\n1\n\u03c6(B\u03c4 (\u03c1)) is bounded below by 2\u03c0\nlog(\u03b4/\u03c1)-and so is the extremal distance\n\u2032\nbetween \u03c6(\u03bb\u03c4 ) and (\u2212\u221e, 0), since 0 is on the closure of \u03c6(B(z, \u03c1)). Let x > 0\nbe the smallest element of R \u2229 \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) and let r > 0 be the smallest positive\nreal such that C(x, r) separates \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) from infinity [so that, in particular,\n\u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) \u2282 B\u0304(x, r)]. Let l be the extremal distance in H \\ \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) between (0, x)\nand (Max(R \u2229 \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 )), +\u221e), that is, the reciprocal of the extremal distance\nin H between (\u2212\u221e, 0) and \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ): We have l \u2264 c/ log(\u03b4/\u03c1).\nOn the other hand, it is possible to find a lower bound for l in terms\nof x and r, as follows: Consider the metric given by u(z) = \u03b1/|z \u2212 x| if\nr/5 < |z \u2212 x| < 5x, and u(z) = 0 otherwise, where \u03b1 is chosen to normalize\nthe surface integral to 1-so that \u03b1 is of order 1/ log(x/r). In this metric, the\nlength of any curve joining (0, x) to (Max(R \u2229 \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 )), +\u221e) around \u03c6(\u03bb\u2032\u03c4 ) is\nat least of order \u03b1 [this can be seen, e.g., by using the conformal map z 7\u2192\nlog(z \u2212 x), which maps u, where it is not zero, to the renormalized Euclidean\nmetric]. Hence, we obtain a lower bound for l, of the form l \u2265 c/ log(x/r),\nand thus an upper bound on r/x of the form c(\u03c1/\u03b4)\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0.\nLet p(r) be the probability that a chordal SLE\u03ba starting at 0 touches the\ncircle C(1, r). Since we are in the case \u03ba < 8, 0 < p(r) < 1 as soon as r \u2208 (0, 1),\nand p(r) goes to 0 with r; besides, the strong Markov property applied at\nthe first hitting time of C(1, r) (if such a time exists) together with K\u00f6be's\n1/4-theorem ensure that there is a finite positive constant C > 1 such that,\nfor all r, r \u2032 < 1, p(rr \u2032 ) \u2264 Cp(r)p(r \u2032 ). So, let r0 be such that p(r0 ) < C \u22122 and\napply the inequality n \u2212 1 times to obtain p(r0n ) \u2264 C n\u22121 (C \u22122 )n \u2264 C \u2212n . This\n\u2032\nimplies that p(r) is bounded above by cr \u03b7 for some \u03b7 \u2032 > 0 [actually, the\noptimal value for \u03b7 \u2032 is the same as the boundary exponent sb = (8/\u03ba) \u2212 1,\nbut we will not need this].\nHence, we obtain\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b7\u2032\n\nr\nP (\u03c4\u0303 < \u221e|F\u03c4 , \u03c4 < \u221e) \u2264 c\nx\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b7\n\n\u2264c\n\n\u03c1\n\u03b4\n\n,\n\nwith \u03b7 > 0, as we wanted.\n(ii) The proof of this estimate is actually a simpler version of the proof\nof the second-moment estimate in the next section, so we will explain it\nin more detail than would probably be necessary. We want to estimate the\nconditional probability, conditionally to F\u03c4 , that \u03c4\u0303 is finite and that the\ncurve \u03b3 hits the circle C(z, r) before \u03c4\u0303 (we say that \u03b3 succeeds if these two\nconditions are satisfied). Fix a \u2208 (0, 1) (its value will be chosen later in the\nproof): If \u03b3 succeeds, then, in particular, it has to hit all the circles of the\n\n\f18\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nform C(z, r\u03c4 ak ) lying between \u03b3(\u03c4 ) and C(z, r), and (the relevant parts of)\nall the circles of the form C(z, \u03c1a\u2212k ) lying between \u03b3(\u03c4 ) and E\u03c4 .\nThe idea is then the following: For each possible ordering of these hitting\ntimes, we will estimate the probability that the circles are hit in this particular order, using the strong Markov property recursively together with\nprevious estimates; we can then sum over all possible orderings to obtain an\nestimate of the probability that \u03b3 succeeds.\nFor each k > 0, let Tk be the first hitting time of C(z, r\u03c4 ak ) by \u03b3. Besides,\nlet \u03bbk be the last connected component of C(z, \u03c1a\u2212k ) \u2229 H\u03c4 which a curve\ngoing from z to z \u2032 has to cross, and let \u03c4k be the first hitting time of \u03bbk by \u03b3.\nLast, let k1 (resp. k2 ) be the largest integer smaller than log(\u03b4/\u03c1)/ log(1/a)\n[resp. log(r\u03c4 /r)/ log(1/a)]: It is sufficient to give an upper bound for the\nprobability that both \u03c4k1 and Tk2 are finite and smaller that \u03c4\u0303 .\nWe describe the ordering of the hitting times by specifying the successive\nnumbers of circles of each kind which \u03b3 hits before time \u03c4\u0303 . More precisely,\nassume that \u03b3 succeeds: Then there are nonnegative integers I, (mi )i\u2264I and\n(li )i\u2264I , all positive except possibly for m1 and lI , such that\n\u03c41 < * * * < \u03c4m1 < T1 < * * * < Tl1 < \u03c4m1 +1 < * * * < \u03c4m1 +m2 < * * * < Tl1 +***+lI < \u03c4\u0303\nand mi = k1 and li = k2 [so that \u03b3 first crosses m1 of the \u03bbk , then l1 of\nthe C(z, r\u03c4 ak ), then m2 new \u03bbk , etc.].\nNotice that at time \u03c4i , Beurling's estimate in the domain B(z, r\u03c4 )\\\u03b3([0, \u03c4i ])\nshows that \u03c9\u03c4i is at most equal to C(r\u03c4i /r\u03c4 )1/2 (by Lemma 7 and the same\nargument as the one used in the proof of Lemma 6). Besides, the same proof\nas that of point (i) in the present lemma shows the following: For given\nvalues of the (mi ) and (li ), for each i, conditionally to FTl1 +***+li and the\nfacts that Tl1 +***+li < \u221e and that the last \u03c4 -time happening before Tl1 +***+li\nis \u03c4m1 +***+mi (as will be the case in the construction), P (\u03c4m1 +***+mi+1 <\n\u221e|FTl1 +***+li ) is bounded by Ca\u03b7mi+1 .\nFor given values of I and the (mi ) and (li ), applying the strong Markov\nproperty at each of the times Tl1 +***+li and \u03c4m1 +***+mi , we get an estimate of\nthe conditional probability (conditionally to F\u03c4 ) that \u03b3 succeeds with this\nparticular ordering, as a product of conditional probabilities, namely,\nP\n\nI\nY\n\ni=1\n\nP\n\nP (\u03c4m1 +***+mi < \u221e|FTl1 +***+li\u22121 )P (Tl1 +***+li < \u221e|F\u03c4m1 +***+mi ).\n\nUsing the previous estimates, and Corollary 5, this product is bounded above\nby\nI\nY\n\ni=1\n\nCa\u03b7mi (al1 +***+li\u22121 )(8/\u03ba\u22121)/2 (ali )1\u2212\u03ba/8 .\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n19\n\nIt remains to sum this estimate over all possible values of I, the mi and\nthe li .

As\nis customary, we write this as m \u22a2 k1 , respectively l \u22a2 k2 . The length of the\npartitions, that is, I, will be denoted as |m| = |l|. Let l+ be the cumulative\nsum of l, that is, the sequence (l1 + * * * + li )1\u2264i\u2264I\u22121 . Using am as a shortcut\nfor the product of the ami , the main step in the proof of (ii) above is the\nfollowing inequality, valid for any positive exponents \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 and for a\nsmall enough that 4ca\u03b3/2 < 1: Uniformly in k1 and k2 ,\n(3.4)\n\nX\n\nm\u22a2k1 ,l\u22a2k2 ,|l|=|m|\n\n+\n\na\u03b1m+\u03b2l+\u03b3l c|l| \u2264 Ca\u03b1k1 /2+\u03b2k2 .\n\nThe direct use of this inequality and similar notation will greatly simplify\nthe writing of the proof in the next section.\nRemark 2. One could describe the behavior of the system in the proof\nof point (ii) in a different way. Let mt (resp. lt ) be the value of k corresponding to the last \u03bbk [resp. C(z, r\u03c4 ak )] discovered by \u03b3 by time t (or 0 if t < \u03c41 ,\nresp. t < T1 ). The process (mt , lt ) takes values in N2 ; looking at it at times\nTl1 +***+li , one can couple it with a discrete-time Markov chain (Mi , Li ) in\n\u03a9 = N2 \u222a {\u2206}, with an absorbing state \u2206 and transition probabilities given\nby the following:\n\u2022 P (Mi+1 = Mi + m, Li+1 = Li + l|Mi , Li ) = 0 if m \u2264 0 or l \u2264 0,\n\u2022 P (Mi+1 = Mi + m, Li+1 = Li + l|Mi , Li ) \u2264 Ca\u03b7m+(8/\u03ba\u22121)Mi /2+(1\u2212\u03ba/8)l if\nm > 0 and l > 0.\nThe probability estimate provided by point (ii) of the previous lemma is\nthen bounded above by the probability that this Markov chain, started at\n(0, 0), reaches the domain Dk1 ,k2 = Jk1 , \u221eJ\u00d7Jk2 , \u221eJ. Such a probability can\nbe estimated by summing the probabilities of all possible paths going from\n(0, 0) to Uk1 ,k2 (which corresponds to the proof we just gave), or by finding\nan appropriate super-harmonic function on N2 . However, we could not find\na simple expression for such a super-harmonic function.\n\n\f21\n\nTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n3.2. The proof. Applying Lemma 6, Corollary 5 and the strong Markov\nproperty, we obtain the following estimate (which we will refer to as the\nmain estimate): For every good time t and every radius r \u2208 (0, rt ),\n(3.5)\n\nP (\u03b3([t, \u221e)) \u2229 B(z, r) 6= \u2205|Ft , t < \u221e) \u2264 C\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrt\n\n\u0013s \u0012\n\nrt\n\u03c1t\n\n\u0013sb /2\n\n,\n\nwhere we define the hull and boundary exponents by\n\u03ba\n8\nand sb = \u2212 1\n8\n\u03ba\nand where C depends only on \u03ba. The way to obtain the required secondmoment estimate from this upper bound is actually quite similar in spirit to\nthe way we proved point (ii) of Lemma 8: We will split the event that \u03b3 hits\ntwo small disks according to the order in which it visits a finite family of\ncircles, estimate each of these individual probabilities as a product using the\nstrong Markov property, and then sum over all possibilities. The notation is\nquite heavier than previously, though.\nIntroduce a small constant a \u2208 (0, 1) (the value of which will be determined later) and let \u03b4n = an \u03b4. We will split the event\ns=1\u2212\n\nE\u03b5 (z, z \u2032 ) := {B(z, \u03b5) \u2229 \u03b3([0, \u221e)) 6= \u2205, B(z \u2032 , \u03b5) \u2229 \u03b3([0, \u221e)) 6= \u2205}\n\naccording to the order in which the processes (rt ), (rt\u2032 ), (\u03c1t ) and (\u03c1\u2032t ) reach\nthe values \u03b4n . For convenience, let n\u0304 = \u230alog(\u03b5/\u03b4)/ log a\u230b: It is sufficient to\nestimate the probability that both (rt ) and (rt\u2032 ) reach the value \u03b4n\u0304 .\nLet Tn (resp. Tn\u2032 , \u03c4n , \u03c4n\u2032 ) be the first time when rt (resp. rt\u2032 , \u03c1t , \u03c1\u2032t ) is not\ngreater than \u03b4n (or infinity, if such a time does not exist). We will call all\nthese stopping times discovery times.\nLemma 9. For all n, n\u2032 > 0, we have the following (as well as their counterparts obtained by exchanging the roles of z and z \u2032 ) if all the involved\nstopping times are finite:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\n\u03b3\u03c4n \u2208 C(z, \u03b4n ) \u2229 B\u03c4n (\u03b4n ); in particular, |\u03b3\u03c4n \u2212 z| = \u03b4n ;\nTn < Tn+1 and \u03c4n < \u03c4n+1 ;\nT\u0303n < \u03c4n ;\nIf Tn < Tn\u2032 \u2032 , then T\u0303n < Tn\u2032 \u2032 , and similarly replacing T (resp. T \u2032 , resp. both)\nby \u03c4 (resp. \u03c4 \u2032 , resp. both).\n\nProof. Point (i) was proved as part of Lemma 8; point (ii) is then\nobvious and point (iii) is a direct consequence of Lemma 7, so only (iv)\nrequires a proof.\nAssume that Tn < Tn\u2032 \u2032 . Let \u03b6 be a curve going from z to z \u2032 , obtained\nby concatenating \u03b61 \u2282 BTn (\u03b4n ), \u03b3([Tn , Tn\u2032 \u2032 ]) and \u03b62 \u2282 BT \u2032 \u2032 (\u03b4n\u2032 ). Such a curve\nn\n\n\f22\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nhas to cross \u03bb\u2032Tn (by definition), and that can only happen on \u03b3((Tn , Tn\u2032 \u2032 ))\nbecause the distance between ETn and z (resp. z \u2032 ) is greater than \u03b4n (resp.\n\u03b4n\u2032 ). This is equivalent to saying that T\u0303n < Tn\u2032 \u2032 , which is what we wanted.\nThe same reasoning applies when replacing T by \u03c4 and/or T \u2032 by \u03c4 \u2032 . \u0003\nHere is a somewhat informal description of the construction we will do.\nAssume that \u03b3 hits both B(z, \u03b4n\u0304 ) and B(z \u2032 , \u03b4n\u0304 ). In order to do it, it has to\ncross all the circles of radii \u03b4n , n \u2264 n\u0304 around z and z \u2032 , and it will do so in\na certain order, coming back to the separator set E between explorations\naround z and around z \u2032 [this is the meaning of point (iv) of the previous\nlemma]. We call a task the time interval spanning between two successive\nsuch returns on E. The conditional probability that a given task is performed,\nconditionally to its past, is then given by the main estimate (3.5), and the\nrest of the construction is then very similar to the proof of point (ii) in\nLemma 8.\nLet S0 = 0 and define the stopping times Si and Si\u2032 for i > 0, inductively,\nas follows:\n\u2022 Si\u2032 = Min({Tn , Tn\u2032 , \u03c4n , \u03c4n\u2032 } \u2229 (Si\u22121 , \u221e)), that is, Si\u2032 is the first discovery time\nafter Si\u22121 , if such a time exists;\n\u2022 Si = S\u0303i\u2032 if Si\u2032 is a Tn or a \u03c4n , Si = \u0160i\u2032 if Si\u2032 is a Tn\u2032 or a \u03c4n\u2032 -again if such a\ntime exists.\nContinue the construction until the first ball of radius \u03b4n\u0304 is hit by the\n\u2032\ncurve; let I be chosen in such a way that this happens at time SI\u22121\n. The\ncurve still has to come back to E after that, so SI\u22121 is well defined. Then,\nsimply let SI be the hitting time of the second ball of radius \u03b4n\u0304 . We call\ntask a time-interval of the form (Si\u22121 , Si ]; I is then simply the number of\ntasks. Following our construction, the last task is different from the others\nand will have to be treated specially.\nFor each i \u2264 I, let Ji (resp. Ki , Ji\u2032 , Ki\u2032 ) be the largest integer n > 0 for\nwhich \u03c4n (resp. Tn , \u03c4n\u2032 , Tn\u2032 ) is smaller than Si , if such an integer exists, and\n0 if it does not. By construction,\n\u03b4Ki +1 < rSi \u2264 \u03b4Ki ,\n\n\u03b4Ji +1 < \u03c1Si ,\n\u2032\nfor\nand \u03c1Si .\nof quadruples (Ji , Ki , Ji\u2032 , Ki\u2032 )i\u2264I ,\nrS\u2032 i\n\nand similar inequalities hold\nwhich is not\nSo, we obtain a sequence\nMarkovian but on which we can say enough to obtain the needed second\u2032 ,\nmoment estimate. First of all, for each i < I, at least one of Ji+1 , Ki+1 , Ji+1\n\u2032\nKi+1 is larger than its counterpart at index i; but if Ji+1 > Ji or Ki+1 > Ki ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= Ki\u2032 , by point (iv) of Lemma 9. The main estimate\n= Ji\u2032 and Ki+1\nthen Ji+1\nimplies the following bound: for each k > 0,\n(3.6)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP ((Ji+1 , Ki+1 , Ji+1\n, Ki+1\n) = (Ji , Ki + k, Ji\u2032 , Ki\u2032 )|FSi )\n\n\u2264 Casb (Ki \u2212Ji )/2 ask .\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n23\n\nPoint (ii) of Lemma 8 then says that, for every j > 0 and k \u2265 0, and if\ni < I \u2212 1,\n(3.7)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP ((Ji+1 , Ki+1 , Ji+1\n, Ki+1\n) = (Ji + j, Ki + k, Ji\u2032 , Ki\u2032 )|FSi )\n\n\u2264 Ca\u03b7(Ji +j) ask .\n\nThe first of these bounds also applies in the second case, still as a consequence of the main estimate, so we get a last estimate for the last step: for\nevery j > 0,\n(3.8)\n\n\u2032\n, n\u0304)|FSI\u22121 )\nP ((JI , KI , JI\u2032 , KI\u2032 ) = (JI\u22121 + j, n\u0304, JI\u22121\n\n\u2264 Casb (KI\u22121 \u2212JI\u22121 )/2 ask .\n\nNotice that here and from now on, as the estimates on radii we get from\nthe values of the J and K are only valid up to a multiplicative factor of order\na, the constants C appearing in the estimates now depend on the value of\na.\nLemma 10 (Reduction). With the previous notation, any jump of the\nsecond kind, that is, corresponding to equation (3.7), and such that both j\nand k are positive, satisfies Ji + j = Ki . In other words, in such a case \u03b3\ncloses a fjord of width comparable to rSi and then approaches z before going\nback to the separator set (see Figure 5).\n\nFig. 5.\n\nSecond moments: Reduction.\n\n\f24\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nProof. First notice that Lemma 7 ensures that Ji + j \u2264 Ki ; assume that\nJi + j < Ki . Let \u03c4 = \u03c4Ji +j and T = TKi +k , and assume that both lie between\nSi and Si+1 and that \u03c4 < T : At time \u03c4 , the situation is similar to the one\nin Lemma 8. Construct \u03b6 \u2032 as in the proof of Lemma 8, and continue \u03b6 \u2032 to a\ncrosscut \u03b6\u0302 \u2032 separating z \u2032 from infinity, and still contained in B\u03c4 (\u03b4Ji +j )-this\nis possible by the definition of \u03c4 . Let \u03c4 \u2032 be the first time after \u03c4 such that\n\u03b3\u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 \u2202B\u03c4 (\u03b4Ki ) (necessarily \u03c4 \u2032 < T ). Let \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 be a continuous curve joining \u03b3\u03c4 \u2032\nto z inside B\u03c4 (\u03b4Ki ). Because the unbounded component of H\u03c4 \\ \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 is simply\nconnected, the concatenation of \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 and \u03b3([\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 ]) is homotopic to \u03b6 \u2032 , and in\nparticular, it separates \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 from infinity. Hence, B\u03c4 (\u03b4Ki ) separates z \u2032 from\ninfinity in H\u03c4 \u2032 , and in particular, \u03c4Ki < T . This contradicts the hypothesis\nJi + j < Ki .\nThe same construction applies if, among the discovery times lying between\nSi and Si+1 , there is a \u03c4 -time before a T -time. The last case to consider is\nthen when T = TKi +k happens before any closing time. In particular, if such\nis the case, BT (\u03b4Ji +1 ) does not separate z \u2032 from infinity in HT . The same\nproof as that of Lemma 7 then shows that \u03c4Ji +1 > T\u0303 = Si+1 , which again is\na contradiction. \u0003\nThis reduction means that, as far as reaching probabilities are concerned,\nthe jump from (Ji , Ki ) to (Ji + j, Ki + k) behaves exactly like the succession\nof two jumps, from (Ji , Ki ) to (Ji + j, Ki ) = (Ki , Ki ) (which happens with\nprobability not greater than Ca\u03b7(Ji +j) ) and then from (Ki , Ki ) to (Ki , Ki +\nk) (which happens with probability not greater than Cask ): Up to replacing\nC with C 2 , we can assume in the computations that jumps of the type\ncorresponding to equation (3.7) only happen with k = 0, and\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(3.9) P ((Ji+1 , Ki+1 , Ji+1\n, Ki+1\n) = (Ji + j, Ki , Ji\u2032 , Ki\u2032 )|FSi ) \u2264 Ca\u03b7(Ji +j) .\n\nAgain, this estimate does not hold for the very last task-which, according\nto this decomposition, would correspond to the fact that the last two jumps\nare a jump of J followed by a jump of K, this last one reaching the value n\u0304. In\nthat case, with the notation in equation (3.8), we would have j = KI\u22121 \u2212JI\u22121\nfrom the previous Lemma. Assuming that \u03b7 < sb /2, which we can do, we then\nobtain the following estimate for the second-to-last jump in the previous\nreduction (the last jump always involves K):\n(3.10)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP ((JI\u22121 , KI\u22121 , JI\u22121\n, KI\u22121\n) = (JI\u22122 + j, KI\u22122 , JI\u22122\n, n\u0304)|FSI\u22122 )\n\n\u2264 Ca\u03b7j .\n\nIn other words, here only the last jump of J appears in the exponent as\nopposed to the end-value in the other cases. (In fact, using the main estimate\nhere amounts to discarding that last jump of J entirely, but writing the\n\n\f25\n\nTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\nestimate this way makes for a slightly more pleasant computation below.)\nThis turns out to be enough for our purposes.\nAll we need to do then is to estimate the probability that (Ki , Ki\u2032 ) reaches\n(n\u0304, n\u0304). With this formulation, it would be nice to give a super-harmonic function associated to the process, but despite our best effort, we could not find\nsuch a function. The natural candidate would be of the form C \u2032 as(n\u0304\u2212K)+\u03b7(K\u2212J)/2 ,\nbut this might fail to be super-harmonic along the diagonal-the reason being that C now depends on a.\nSo, we will apply the same strategy as in the proof of point (ii) of Lemma 8,\nnamely, sum over all possible paths starting at (0, 0, 0, 0) and ending on\n(J, n\u0304, J \u2032 , n\u0304) for some J, J \u2032 \u2208 J0, n\u0304K (which we will call good paths). This leads\nto rather unpleasant computations, but the general strategy should be clear\nenough.\nLook first at the components Ji and Ki of the walk: Along a good path,\nthe jumps of (Ji , Ki ) affect either its first or its second coordinate. Let n \u2265 0\nbe the number of jumps affecting (Ji ), and let j1 , . . . , jn > 0 be their lengths.\nThen, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let li \u2265 0 be the number of jumps affecting K between\nthe ith and (i + 1)st jumps of J , and let ki,1 , . . . , ki,li > 0 be their lengths-\nwith the obvious abuse of notation that l0 is the number of jumps of K\nbefore the first jump of J , and ln is the number of jumps of K after the last\njump of J . In particular, the sum of all ki,j is equal to n\u0304. Define the integers\n\u2032 in a similar fashion to describe the behavior of (J \u2032 , K \u2032 ).\nn\u2032 , ji\u2032 , li\u2032 and ki,j\ni\ni\nNotice that, just before the jump corresponding to ji , the value of J is\nj1 + * * * + ji\u22121 . Besides, let di \u2265 0 be the value of K \u2212 J just after that jump\n(di is the difference between the sum of the k's and that of the j's so far):\nJust before the jump corresponding to ki,j , the value of K \u2212 J is equal to\ndi + ki,1 + * * * + ki,j\u22121 . This is sufficient to estimate the probability that a\ngiven path occurs: It will be given by the product along the path of the\n(conditional, given the past) probabilities of the individual steps, which is\nbounded above by the product of two terms, namely,\nA := a\u2212\u03b7(j1 +***+jn\u22121 )\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\nl0\nY\n\nC(ak0,j )s (ak0,1 +***+k0,j\u22121 )sb /2\n\nj=1\nn\nY\n\n\"\n\ni=1\n\nC(a\n\nj1 +***+ji \u03b7\n\n)\n\nli\nY\n\nj=1\n\nC(a\n\nki,j s\n\n) (a\n\n#\n\ndi +ki,1 +***+ki,j\u22121 sb /2\n\n)\n\n.\n\nHere, the empty products are equal to 1 by convention. The term a\u2212\u03b7(j1 +***+jn\u22121 )\naccounts for the difference in the very last task, where as was pointed out\nabove, only the last jump of J , that is, jn , appears in the exponent.

BEFFARA\n\nThis last sum is again convergent, so we obtain B 2 \u2264 Ca2sn\u0304 , with a constant\nC depending only on \u03ba and a.\nPutting everything together, assuming E\u03b5 (z, z \u2032 ) holds, first \u03b3 has to reach\nE, and this happens with probability of order \u03b4s . Then, conditionally to\nthe process up to this hitting time, we can apply the previous reasoning\nwhich says that the conditional probability to hit both disks of radius \u03b4n\u0304 is\nbounded above by Ca2n\u0304s where C depends only on a and \u03ba. Hence,\nP (E\u03b5 (z, z \u2032 )) \u2264 C\u03b4s a2n\u0304s .\n\nNotice that an\u0304 \u2264 (\u03b5/\u03b4)a\u22121 to finally obtain\n\n\u03b52s\n,\n\u03b4s\nwhich is precisely the estimate we were looking for.\nP (E\u03b5 (z, z \u2032 )) \u2264 Ca\u22122s\n\n4. The occupation density measure. As a side remark, let us consider the\nproof of the lower bound for the dimension (cf. Section 1). It is based on the\nconstruction of a Frostman measure \u03bc supported on the path, constructed\nas a subsequential limit of the family (\u03bc\u03b5 ) defined by their densities with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure on the upper-half plane:\nd\u03bc\u03b5 (z) = \u03b5\u2212s 1z\u2208C\u03b5 | dz|.\nThen, \u03bc is a random measure with correlations between \u03bc(A) and \u03bc(B), for\ndisjoint compact sets A and B, decaying as a power of their inverse distance.\nSo, at least formally, it behaves in this respect like a conformal field: the onepoint function (corresponding to the density of \u03bc) is not welldefined, because\n\u03bc is singular to the Lebesgue measure, but the two-point correlation\nlim \u03b4\u22124 Cov(\u03bc(B(z, \u03b4)), \u03bc(B(z \u2032 , \u03b4)))\n\n\u03b4\u21920\n\nbehaves like d(z, z \u2032 )\u22121+\u03ba/8 .\nA little more can be said about this measure, or about its expectation. The\nproof of the estimate for P (\u03b3 \u2229 B(z, \u03b5) 6= \u2205) can be refined in the following\nway: When we apply the stopping theorem (2.8), saying that the diffusion\nconditioned to survive has a limiting distribution shows that\n\u03b1s\nE sin\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00138/\u03ba\u22121\n\nS \u2265s\n\n\u0015\n\nhas a limit \u03bb when s \u2192 \u221e, and that this limit depends only on \u03ba. So what\nwe get out of the construction in Section 2 is\n\u0012\n\nP \u2203t > 0 : |gt\u2032 (z)| \u2265\n\nI(z)\n\u03b5\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u223c \u03bb(\u03ba)\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n\u03b5\nIz\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03ba/8\n\n(sin(arg(z)))8/\u03ba\u22121 .\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n29\n\nThis lead us to an estimate on P (d(z, \u03b3) < \u03b5) by the K\u00f6be 1/4 theorem; but\nit is also natural to measure the distance to \u03b3 by the modulus of g\u2032 . We can\nnow define\n\u0013\n\u0012\nI(z)\n\u03ba/8\u22121\n\u2032\n:\n\u03c61 (z) = lim \u03b5\nP \u2203t > 0 : |gt (z)| \u2265\n\u03b5\u21920\n\u03b5\nthe previous estimate boils down to\n\u03c61 (z) = \u03bb(\u03ba)I(z)\u03ba/8\u22121 sin(arg z)8/\u03ba\u22121 ,\nand by the construction of \u03bc, we obtain that, for every Borel subset A of\nthe upper-half plane,\nE(\u03bc(A)) \u224d\n\nZ\n\nA\n\n\u03c61 (z)| dz|,\n\nwith universal constants.\nIt is then possible to do this construction for several points; note first that\nthe second moment estimate can actually be written as\nP ({z, z \u2032 } \u2282 C\u03b5 ) \u224d\n\n\u03b52(1\u2212\u03ba/8)\n,\n|z \u2212 z \u2032 |1\u2212\u03ba/8 I((z + z \u2032 )/2)1\u2212\u03ba/8\n\nas long as both I(z) and I(z \u2032 ) are bounded below by |z \u2212 z \u2032 |/M for some\nfixed M > 0. Indeed, the upper bound is exactly what we derived in the\nprevious section, and the lower bound is provided by the term n = n\u2032 = 0 in\nthe sum. Hence, any subsequential limit \u03c8(z, z \u2032 ), as \u03b5 vanishes, of\n\u03b52(\u03ba/8\u22121) P ({z, z \u2032 } \u2282 C\u03b5 )\n\nsatisfies \u03c8(z, z \u2032 ) \u224d \u03c62 (z, z \u2032 ) for some fixed function \u03c62 , with constants depending only on \u03ba. The second moment estimate then shows that\n\u03c61 (z)\n,\nz \u2192z |z \u2212 z \u2032 |1\u2212\u03ba/8\n\n\u03c62 (z, z \u2032 ) \u2032\u224d\n\nthat is, \u03c62 behaves like a correlation function when z and z \u2032 are close to\neach other.\nThe general case of n points, n \u2265 2, can be treated in the same fashion.\nFirst, the derivation of second moments admits a generalization to n points,\nas follows. Let (zi )1\u2264i\u2264n be n distinct points in H, such that their imaginary\nparts are large enough (bigger than, say, 18n times the maximal distance\nbetween any two of them). We use them to construct a Voronoi tessellation\nof the plane; denote by Ci the face containing zi , and by \u03b4i the (Euclidean)\ndistance between zi and \u2202Ci . Let C(z0 , \u03b40 ) be the smallest circle containing\nall the discs B(zi , \u03b4i ). Last, let E be the \"separator set\" between the zi 's,\ndefined as\nE = C(z0 , \u03b40 ) \u222a\n\n\"\n\nn\n[\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\n#\n\n\u2202Ci \u2229 B(z0 , \u03b40 ) .\n\n\f30\n\nV. BEFFARA\n\nIt is the same as defined previously in the case n = 2.\nThe previous proof can then be adapted to show that\nP ({z1 , . . . , zn } \u2282 C\u03b5 ) \u224d\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b40 \u03b5n\nQ\n\u03b4i\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03ba/8\n\n(using radii \u03b4i ak for the circles around zi ). In the case n = 2, we have \u03b41 =\n\u03b42 = \u03b40 /2, so this estimate is exactly the same as previously. So, it makes\nsense to take a (subsequential) limit, as \u03b5 tends to 0, of\n\u03b5n(\u03ba/8\u22121) P ({z1 , . . . , zn } \u2282 C\u03b5 ),\nand all possible subsequential limits are comparable to a fixed symmetric\nfunction \u03c6n .\nThe behavior of \u03c6n (z1 , . . . , zn ) when zn approaches the boundary is then\ngiven by the boundary term in Proposition 4, that is, \u03c6 behaves like (Izn )8/\u03ba\u22121\nthere. Last, it is easy to see that, when zn tends to z1 , \u03c6n (z1 , . . . , zn ) has a\nsingularity which is comparable to |zn \u2212 z1 |\u03ba/8\u22121 ; in other words, we have a\nrecursive relation between all the \u03c6n 's, given by\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c6n (z1 , . . . , zn )\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u03c6n (z1 , . . . , zn )\n\n\u224d\n\nzn \u2192z1\n\n\u224d\n\nIzn \u21920\n\n\u03c6n\u22121 (z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 )\n,\n|zn \u2212 z1 |1\u2212\u03ba/8\n\n\u03c6n\u22121 (z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 ) * (Izn )8/\u03ba\u22121 .\n\nThese relations are very similar to some of those satisfied by the correlation functions in conformal field theory. In fact, it is possible to push the\nrelation further, in two ways. First, we can look at the evolution of the system in time. This corresponds to mapping the whole picture by the map\ngt \u2212 \u03b2t , and this map acts on the discs of small radius around the zi 's like\na multiplication of factor |gt\u2032 (zi )| (as long as Kt remains far away from the\nzi 's, which we may assume if t is small enough). Hence, the process\nYtn :=\n\n\u0010Y\n\n\u0011\n\n|gt\u2032 (zi )|1\u2212\u03ba/8 \u03c6n (gt (z1 ) \u2212 \u03b2t , . . . , gt (zn ) \u2212 \u03b2t )\n\n(defined as long as all the zi 's remain outside Kt ) is a local martingale. We\ncan apply It\u00f4's formula to compute dYtn , and write that the drift term has\nto be 0 at time 0 to obtain a PDE satisfied by \u03c6n .\nNote though that the formula involves the modulus of gt\u2032 , meaning that\nthe equation we would obtain cannot be expressed in terms of complex\nderivatives of gt only, and that we have to introduce derivatives with respect\nto the coordinates. This is also the case for the second-order term in It\u00f4's\nformula: Since \u03b2 is a real process, we would obtain terms involving second\nderivatives of \u03c6n with respect to the x-coordinates of the arguments. To sum\nit up, it would be an ugly formula without the correct formalism-which is\n\n\fTHE DIMENSION OF THE SLE CURVES\n\n31\n\nwhy we do not put it here. The formula is much nicer when considering\npoints on the boundary of the domain-compare [5].\nThe last thing we can do is study what happens if we add one point\nzn+1 to the picture. This will add one multiplicative factor, corresponding\n(at least intuitively) to the conditional probability to hit zn+1 knowing that\nwe touch the first n points already. In the case \u03ba = 8/3 and for points on\nthe boundary of the domain, this can be computed using the restriction\nproperty, and it leads to Ward's equations (cf. [5]). In the \"bulk\" (i.e., for\npoints inside the domain), or for other values of \u03ba, it is not clear yet how to\ndo it.\n5. The boundary. A natural question is the determination of the dimension of the boundary of Kt for some fixed t, in the case \u03ba > 4. The\nconjectured value is\n2\ndimH (\u2202Kt ) = 1 + ,\n\u03ba\nand this can now be proved for a few values of \u03ba for which the boundary\nof K can be related to the path of an SLE\u03ba\u2032 with \u03ba\u2032 = 16/\u03ba. In fact, this\nrelation is only known in the cases where convergence of a discrete model to\nSLE is known, namely:\n\u2022 \u03ba = 6, where actually both \u2202Kt and the path of the SLE\u03ba\u2032 are closely\nrelated to the Brownian frontier. Hence, we obtain a third derivation of\nthe dimension of the Brownian frontier, this time through SLE8/3 .\n\u2022 \u03ba = 8: Here, SLE8 is known to be the scaling limit of the uniform Peano\ncurve and SLE2 that of the loop-erased random walk (cf. [12]). Since these\ntwo discrete objects are closely related through Wilson's algorithm, this\nshows that the local structure of the SLE2 curve and the SLE8 boundary\nare the same, and in particular, they have the same dimension.\nSo we obtain one additional result here:\nCorollary 11. Let (Kt ) be a chordal SLE8 in the upper-half plane:\nThen, for all t > 0, the boundary of Kt almost surely has Hausdorff dimension 5/4.\nIt would be nice to have a direct derivation of the general result, without\nusing the \"duality\" between SLE\u03ba and SLE16/\u03ba ; but it is not even clear how\nto obtain a precise estimate of the probability that a given ball intersects\nthe boundary of K1 .\n\n\f32\n\nV.
