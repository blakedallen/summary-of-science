At present there\nare two important experimental facts which are not under dispute: (1) the critical temperature Tc in cuprates\nis high, with the maximum Tcmax \u223c 160 K in the Hg1223 compounds; (2) the pairing in cuprates is d-wave\nlike, i.e. \u2206(k, \u03c9) \u2248 \u2206s (k, \u03c9) + \u2206d (\u03c9)(cos kx \u2212 cos ky )\nwith \u2206s < 0.1\u2206d . On the contrary there is a dispute\nconcerning the scattering mechanism which governs normal state properties and pairing in cuprates. To this\nend, we stress that in the HTSC cuprates, a number\nof properties can be satisfactorily explained by assuming that the quasi-particle dynamics is governed by some\nelectron-boson scattering and in the superconducting\nstate bosonic quasi-particles are responsible for Cooper\npairing. Which bosonic quasi-particles are dominating\nin the cuprates is the subject which will be discussed in\nthis work. It is known that the electron-boson (phonon)\nscattering is well described by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory if the adiabatic parameter A \u2261 \u03b1 * \u03bb(\u03c9 B /Wb ) fulfills\nthe condition A \u226a 1, where \u03bb is the electron-boson coupling constant, \u03c9B is the characteristic bosonic energy\nand Wb is the electronic band width and \u03b1 depends on\nnumerical approximations [1]. The important character-\n\nistic of the electron-boson scattering is the Eliashberg\nspectral function \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) (or its average \u03b12 F (\u03c9))\nwhich characterizes scattering of quasi-particle from k\nto k\u2032 by exchanging bosonic energy \u03c9. Therefore, in systems with electron-boson scattering the knowledge of this\nfunction is of crucial importance. There are at least two\napproaches differing in assumed pairing bosons in the\nHTSC cuprates. The first one is based on the electronphonon interaction (EPI), with the main proponents in\n[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], where mediating bosons are phonons\nand where the average spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is similar\nto the phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9). Note, \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is\nnot the product of two functions although sometimes one\ndefines the function \u03b12 (\u03c9) = \u03b12 F (\u03c9)/F (\u03c9) which should\napproximate the energy dependence of the strength of\nthe EPI coupling. There are numerous experimental evidence in cuprates for the importance of the EPI scattering mechanism with a rather large coupling constant in\nthe normal scattering channel 1 < \u03bbep . 3, which will be\ndiscussed in detail below. In the EPI approach \u03b12 Fph (\u03c9)\nis extracted from tunnelling measurements in conjunction\nwith IR optical measurements. We stress again that the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory is well justified framework for\nEPI since in most superconductors the condition A < 1\nis fulfilled. The HTSC cuprates are on the borderline and\nit is a natural question - under which condition can high\nTc be realized in the non-adiabatic limit A \u223c 1? The\nsecond approach [7] assumes that EPI is too weak to be\nresponsible for high Tc in cuprates and it is based on a\nphenomenological model for spin-fluctuation interaction\n(SF I) as the dominating scattering mechanism, i.e. it\nis a non-phononic mechanism. In this (phenomenological) approach the spectral function is proportional to the\nimaginary part of the spin susceptibility Im\u03c7(k \u2212 k\u2032 , \u03c9),\ni.e. \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) \u223c Im\u03c7(k \u2212 k\u2032 , \u03c9). NMR spectroscopy\n\n\f2\nand magnetic neutron scattering give evidence that in\nHTSC cuprates \u03c7(q, \u03c9) is peaked at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a) and this property is\nvery favorable for d-wave pairing. The SF I theory roots\nbasically on the strong electronic repulsion on Cu atoms,\nwhich is usually studied by the Hubbard model or its\n(more popular) derivative the t-J model. Regarding the\npossibility to explain high Tc solely by strong correlations, as it is reviewed in [8], we stress two facts. First, at\npresent there is no viable theory as well as experimental\nfacts which can justify these (non-phononic) mechanisms\nof pairing with some exotic pairing mechanism such as\nRVB pairing [8], fractional statistics and anyon superconductivity, etc. Therefore we shall not discuss these,\nin theoretical sense, very interesting approaches. Second,\nthe central question in these non-phononic approaches\nis - do models based solely on the Hubbard Hamiltonian show up superconductivity at sufficiently high critical temperatures (Tc \u223c 100 K) ? Although the answer\non this important question is not definitely settled there\nare a number of numerical studies of these models which\noffer rather convincing negative answers. For instance,\nthe sign-free variational Monte Carlo algorithm in the\n2D repulsive (U > 0) Hubbard model gives no evidence\nfor superconductivity with high T c , neither the BCS- nor\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like [9]. At the\nsame time, similar calculations show that there is a strong\ntendency to superconductivity in the attractive (U < 0)\nHubbard model for the same strength of U , i.e. at finite\ntemperature in the 2D model with U < 0 the BKT superconducting transition is favored. Concerning the possibility of HTSC in the t \u2212 J model, various numerical calculations such as Monte Carlo calculations of the Drude\nspectral weight [10] and high temperature expansion for\nthe pairing susceptibility [11] have shown that there is\nno superconductivity at temperatures characteristic for\ncuprates and if it exists Tc must be rather low - few\nKelvins. These numerical results tell us that the lack of\nhigh Tc (even in 2D BKT phase) in the repulsive (U > 0)\nsingle-band Hubbard model and in the t \u2212 J model is not\nonly due to thermodynamical 2D-fluctuations (which at\nfinite T suppress and destroy superconducting phase coherence in large systems) but it is mostly due to an inherent ineffectiveness of strong correlations to produce solely\nhigh Tc in cuprates. These numerical results signal that\nthe simple single-band Hubbard and its derivative the t-J\nmodel are insufficient to explain solely the pairing mechanism in cuprates and some additional ingredients must\nbe included.\nSince EP I is rather strong in cuprates, then it must\nbe accounted for. As it will be argued in the following, the experimental support for the importance of EPI\nin cuprates comes from optics, tunnelling, and recent\nARPES measurements [12]. It is worth mentioning that\nrecent ARPES activity was a strong impetus for renewed experimental and theoretical studies of EPI in\ncuprates. However, in spite of accumulating experimental evidence for importance of EPI with \u03bbep > 1, there\n\nare occasionally reports which doubt its importance in\ncuprates. This is the case with recent interpretation of\nsome optical measurements in terms of SFI only [13], [14],\n[15] and with LDA-DFT (local density approximationdensity functional theory) band structure calculations\n[16], [17], where both claim that EPI is negligibly small,\ni.e. \u03bbep < 0.3. The inappropriateness of these calculations will be discussed in the following Sections.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Part I we will\nmainly discuss experimental results in cuprates at and\nnear optimal doping by giving also minimal theoretical explanations which are related to the bosonic spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) as well to the transport spectral\nfunction \u03b12tr F (\u03c9) and their relations to EPI. The reason that we study only cuprates at and near optimal\ndoping is, that in these systems there are rather well\ndefined quasi-particles - although strongly interacting,\nwhile in highly underdoped systems the superconductivity is perplexed and possibly masked by other phenomena, such as pseudogap effects, formation of small\npolarons, interaction with spin and (possibly charge) order parameters, pronounced inhomogeneities of the scattering centers, etc. As ARPES experiments confirm\nthere are no polaronic effects in systems at and near\noptimal doping, while there are pronounced polaronic\neffects due to EPI in undoped and very underdoped\nHTSC [5], [6]. In this work we consider mainly those\ndirect one-particle and two-particles probes of low energy quasi-particle excitations and scattering rates which\ngive information on the structure of the spectral functions\n\u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) and \u03b12tr F (\u03c9) in systems near optimal doping. These are angle-resolved photoemission (ARP ES),\nvarious arts of tunnelling spectroscopy such as superconductor/insulator/ normal metal (SIN ) junctions and\nbreak junctions, scanning-tunnelling microscope spectroscopy (ST M ), infrared (IR) and Raman optics, inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering, etc. We shall argue\nthat these direct probes give evidence for a rather strong\nEPI in cuprates. Some other experiments on EPI are\nalso discussed in order to complete the arguments for the\nimportance of EPI in cuprates. The detailed contents of\nPart I is the following. In Section II we discuss some prejudices related to the strength of EP I as well as on the\nFermi-liquid behavior of HTSC cuprates. We argue that\nany non-phononic mechanism of pairing should have very\nlarge bare critical temperature Tc0 \u226b Tc in the presence\nof the large EPI coupling constant, \u03bbep \u2265 1, if the EPI\nspectral function is weakly momentum dependent, i.e.\nif \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) \u2248 \u03b12 F (\u03c9) like in low temperature superconductors. The fact that EPI is large in the normal state\nof cuprates and the condition that it must conform with\nd-wave pairing implies inevitably that EPI in cuprates\nmust be strongly momentum dependent. In Section III\nwe discuss direct and indirect experimental evidence for\nthe importance of EPI in cuprates and for the weakness\nof SFI in cuprates. These are:\n(A) Magnetic neutron scattering measurements These measurements provide dynamic spin susceptibil-\n\n\f3\nity \u03c7(q, \u03c9) which is in the SF I phenomenological approach [7] related to the Eliashberg spectral function,\n2\ni.e. \u03b12 Fsf (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) \u223c gsf\nIm\u03c7(q = k \u2212 k\u2032 , \u03c9). We stress\nthat such an approach can be theoretically justified only\nin the weak coupling limit, gsf \u226a Wb , where Wb is the\nband width and gsf is the phenomenological SFI coupling\nconstant. Here we discuss experimental results on YBCO\nwhich give evidence for strong rearrangement (with respect to \u03c9) of Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) (with q at and near Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0))\nby doping toward the optimal doped HTSC [18], [19].\nIt turns out that in the optimally doped cuprates with\nTc = 92.5 K Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) is drastically suppressed compared to that in slightly underdoped ones with Tc = 91\nK. This fact implies that the SFI coupling constant gsf\nmust be small.\n(B) Optical conductivity measurements - From these\nmeasurements one can extract the transport relaxation\nrate \u03b3 tr (\u03c9) and indirectly an approximative shape of\nthe transport spectral function \u03b12tr F (\u03c9). In the case\nof systems near optimal doping we discuss the following questions: (i) the physical and quantitative difference between the optical relaxation rate \u03b3 tr (\u03c9) and the\nquasi-particle relaxation rate \u03b3(\u03c9). It was shown in\nthe past that by equating these two (unequal) quantities is dangerous and brings incorrect results concerning\nthe quasi-particle dynamics in most metals by including HTSC cuprates too [2], [3], [20], [21], [22], [23]; (ii)\nmethods of extraction of the transport spectral function\n\u03b12tr F (\u03c9). Although these methods give at finite temperature T a blurred \u03b12tr F (\u03c9) which is (due to the ill-defined\nmethods) temperature dependent, it turns out that the\nwidth and the shape of the extracted \u03b12tr F (\u03c9) are in favor of EP I; (iii) the restricted sum-rule for the optical weight as a function of T which can be explained by\nstrong EP I [24], [25]; (iv) good agreement with experiments of the T -dependence of the resistivity \u03c1(T ) in optimally doped YBCO, where \u03c1(T ) is calculated by using\nthe spectral function from tunnelling experiments. Recent femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy in\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 which gives additional evidence for importance of EPI [26] will be shortly discussed.\n(C ) ARPES measurements and EPI - From these\nmeasurements the self-energy \u03a3(k, \u03c9) is extracted as well\nas some properties of \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9). Here we discuss the\nfollowing items: (i) existence of the nodal and anti-nodal\nkinks in optimally and slightly underdoped cuprates, as\nwell as the structure of the ARPES self-energy (\u03a3(k, \u03c9))\nand its isotope dependence, which are all due to EPI;\n(ii) appearance of different slopes of \u03a3(k, \u03c9) at low (\u03c9 \u226a\n\u03c9 ph ) and high energies (\u03c9 \u226b \u03c9 ph ) which can be explained\nby strong EPI; (iii) formation of small polarons in the undoped HTSC was interpreted to be due to strong EPI this gives rise to phonon side bands which are clearly seen\nin ARPES of undoped HTSC [6].\n(D) Tunnelling spectroscopy - It is well known that\nthis method is of an immense importance in obtaining the spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) from tunnelling conductance. In this part we discuss the following items:\n\n(i) the extracted Eliashberg spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9)\nwith the coupling constant \u03bb(tun) = 2 \u2212 3.5 from\nthe tunnelling conductance of break-junctions in optimally doped YBCO and Bi-2212 [27]-[33] which gives\nthat the maxima of \u03b12 F (\u03c9) coincide with the maxima in the phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9); (ii) existence of eleven peaks in \u2212d2 I/dV 2 in superconducting\nLa1.84 Sr0.16 CuO4 films [34], where these peaks match\nprecisely with the peaks in the intensity of the existing phonon Raman scattering data [35]; (iii) the presence of the dip in dI/dV in STM which shows the pronounced oxygen isotope effect and important role of these\nphonons.\n(E ) Inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements - From these experiments one can extract the\nphonon density of state Fph (\u03c9) and in some cases\nstrengths of the quasi-particle coupling with various\nphonon modes. These experiments give sufficient evidence for quantitative inadequacy of LDA-DFT calculations in HTSC cuprates. Here we argue, that the large\nsoftening and broadening of the half-breathing Cu \u2212 O\nbond-stretching phonon, of apical oxygen phonons and of\noxygen B1g buckling phonons (in LSCO, BISCO,YBCO)\ncan not be explained by LDA-DFT. It is curious that the\nmagnitude of the softening can be partially obtained by\nLDA-DFT but the calculated widths of some important\nmodes are an order of magnitude smaller than the neutron scattering data show. This remarkable fact confirms\nadditionally the inadequacy of LDA-DFT in strongly correlated systems and a more sophisticated many body theory for EPI is needed. The problem of EPI will be discussed in more details in Part II .\nIn Section IV brief summary of the Part I is given.\nSince we are dealing with electron-boson scattering in\ncuprate near optimal doping, then in Appendix A (and\nin Part II) we introduce the reader briefly into the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory for superconductors (and normal metals) where the quasi-particle spectral function \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) and the transport spectral function\n\u03b12tr F (\u03c9) are defined.\nFinally, one can pose a question - do the experimental\nresults of the above enumerated spectroscopic methods\nallow a building of a satisfactory and physically reasonable microscopic theory for basic scattering and pairing\nmechanism in cuprates? The posed question is very modest compared with a much stringent request for the theory\nof everything - which would be able to explain all properties of HTSC materials. Such an ambitious project is not\nrealized even in those low-temperature conventional superconductors where it is definitely proved that in most\nmaterials the pairing is due to EPI and many properties\nare well accounted for by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory.\nLet us mention only two examples: - First, the experimental value for the coherence peak in the microwave\nresponse \u03c3 s (T < Tc , \u03c9 = const) at \u03c9 = 17 GHz in the\nsuperconducting N b is much higher than the theoretical\nvalue obtained by the strong coupling Eliashberg theory\n[36]. So to say, the theory explains the coherence peak\n\n\f4\nat 17 GHz in N b qualitatively but not quantitatively.\nHowever, the measurements at higher frequency \u03c9 \u223c 60\nGHz are in agreement with the Eliashberg theory [37].\nThen one can say that instead of the theory of everything we deal with a satisfactory theory, which allows\nus qualitative and in many aspects quantitative explanation of phenomena in superconducting state. - Second\nexample is the experimental boron (B) isotope effect in\nM gB2 (Tc \u2248 40 K) which is much smaller than the theoretical value, i.e. \u03b1exp\n\u2248 0.3 < \u03b1th\nB = 0.5, although\nB\nthe pairing is due solely by EPI for boron vibrations [38].\nSince the theory of everything is impossible in the complex materials such as HTSC cuprates in Part I we shall\nnot discuss those phenomena which need much more microscopic details and/or more sophisticated many-body\ntheory. These are selected by chance: (i) large ratio\n2\u2206/Tc which is on optimally doped YBCO and BISCO\n\u2248 5 and 7, respectively, while in underdoped BISCO one\nhas even (2\u2206/Tc ) \u2248 20; (ii) peculiarities of the coherence\npeak in the microwave response \u03c3(T ) in HTSC cuprates,\nwhich is peaked at T much smaller than Tc , contrary to\nthe case of LTSC where it occurs near Tc ; (iii) the dependence of Tc on the number of CuO2 in the unit cell;\n(iv ) temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient; (v )\ndistribution of states in the vortex core, etc.\nThe microscopic theory of the mechanism for superconducting pairing in HTSC cuprates will be discussed\nin Part II. In Section V we introduce an ab initio manybody theory of superconductivity which is based on the\nfundamental (microscopic) Hamiltonian and the manybody technique. This theory can in principle calculate measurable properties of materials such as the critical temperature Tc , critical fields, dynamic and transport properties, etc. However, although this method\nis in principle exact, which needs only some fundamental constants e, ~, me , Mion , kB and the chemical composition of superconducting materials, it was practically\nnever realized in practice due to the complexity of manybody interactions - electron-electron and electron-lattice,\nas well as of structural properties. Fortunately, the\nproblem can be simplified by using the fact that superconductivity is a low-energy phenomenon characterized by very small energy parameters (Tc /EF , \u2206/EF ,\n\u03c9 ph /EF ) \u226a 1. It turns out, that one can integrate\nhigh-energy electronic processes (which are not changed\nby the appearance of superconductivity) and then solve\nthe low-energy problem by the (so called) strong-coupling\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory. It turns out that in such an\napproach the physics is separated into: (1) solving an\nideal band-structure Hamiltonian with the nonlocal exact\ncrystal potential (sometimes called excitation potential)\nVIBS (r, r\u2032 ) (IBS - ideal band structure) which includes\n(h)\nthe static self-energy (\u03a3c0 (r, r\u2032 , \u03c9 = 0)) due to highenergy electronic processes, i.e. VIBS (r, r\u2032 ) = [Ve\u2212i (r) +\n(h)\nVH (r)]\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) + \u03a3c0 (r, r\u2032 , \u03c9 = 0), with Ve\u2212i , VH the\nelectron-ion and Hartree potential, respectively; (2) solving the low-energy Eliashberg equations. However, the\ncalculation of the (excited) potential VIBS (r, r\u2032 ) and the\n\nreal EPI coupling gep (r, r\u2032 ) = \u03b4VIBS (r, r\u2032 )/\u03b4Rn , which\ninclude high-energy many-body electronic processes - for\ninstance large Hubbard U effects, is extremely difficult at\npresent, especially in strongly correlated systems such as\nHTSC cuprates. Due to this difficulty the calculations of\nthe EPI coupling in the past was usually based on the\nLDA-DFT method which will be discussed in Section\nVI in the contest of HTSC cuprates, where the nonlocal potential is replaced by the local potential VLDA (r) the ground state potential, and the real EPI coupling by\nthe \"local\" LDA one gep (r) = \u03b4VLDA (r)/\u03b4Rn . Since the\nexchange-correlation effects enter VLDA (r) = Ve\u2212i (r) +\nVH (r) + VXC (r) via the local exchange-correlation potential VXC (r) it is clear that the LDA-DFT method describes strong correlations scarcely and it is inadequate\nin HTSC cuprates (and other strongly correlated systems\nsuch as heavy fermions) wher one needs an approach beyond the LDA-DFT method. In Section VII we discuss\na minimal theoretical model for HTSC cuprates which\ntakes into account a minimal number of electronic orbitals and strong correlations in a controllable manner\n[3]. This theory treats the interplay of EPI and strong\ncorrelations in systems with finite doping in a systematic and controllable way. The minimal model can be\nfurther reduced in some parameter range to the singleband t \u2212 J model, which allows the approximative calculation of the excited potential VIBS (r, r\u2032 ) and the nonlocal EPI coupling gep (r, r\u2032 ). As a result one obtains the\nmomentum dependent EPI coupling gep (kF , q) which is\nfor small hole-doping (\u03b4 < 0.3) strongly peaked at small\ntransfer momenta (more precisely at q = 0) - the forward scattering peak. In the framework of this minimal\nmodel it is possible to explain some important properties and resolve some puzzling experimental results, for\ninstance: (a) Why is d-wave pairing realized in the presence of strong EPI? (b) Why is the transport coupling\nconstant (\u03bbtr ) rather smaller than the pairing one \u03bb, i.e.\n\u03bbtr . \u03bb/3? (c) Why is the mean-field (one-body) LDADFT approach unable to give reliable values for the EPI\ncoupling constant in cuprates and how many-body effects\nhelp; (d ) Why is d-wave pairing robust in the presence\nof non-magnetic impurities and defects? (e) Why are the\nARPES nodal and antinodal kinks differently renormalized in the superconducting states, etc? In spite of the\nencouraging successes of this minimal model, at least in\na qualitative explanation of numerous important properties of HTSC cuprates, we are still at present stage far\nfrom a fully microscopic theory of HTSC cuprates which\nis able to explain high Tc . In that respect at the and\nof Section VII we discuss possible improvements of the\npresent minimal model in order to obtain at least a semiquantitative theory for HTSC cuprates.\nFinally, we would like to point out that in real HTSC\nmaterials there are numerous experimental evidence for\nnanoscale inhomogeneities. For instance recent STM experiments show rather large gap dispersion at least on\nthe surface of BISCO crystals [39] giving rise for a pronounced inhomogeneity of the superconducting order pa-\n\n\f5\nrameter, i.e. \u2206(k, R) where k is the relative momentum of the Cooper pair and R is the center of mass of\nCooper pairs. One possible reason for the inhomogeneity of \u2206(k, R) and disorder on the atomic scale can be\ndue to extremely high doping level of \u223c (10 \u2212 20) % in\nHTSC cuprates which is many orders of magnitude larger\nthan in standard semiconductors (1021 vs 1015 carrier\nconcentration). There are some claims that high Tc is\nexclusively due to these inhomogeneities (of an extrinsic\nor intrinsic origin) which may effectively increase pairing potential [40], while some others try to explain high\nTc solely within the inhomogeneous Hubbard or t \u2212 J\nmodel. Here we shall not discuss this interesting problem but mention only that the concept of Tc increase\nby inhomogeneity is ill-defined, since the increase of Tc\nis defined with respect to the average value T\u0304c . However, T\u0304c is experimentally not well defined quantity and\nthe hypothesis of an increase of Tc by material inhomogeneities cannot be tested at all. In studying and analyzing HTSC cuprates near optimal doping we assume that\nbasic effects are realized in nearly homogeneous systems\nand inhomogeneities are of secondary role, which deserve\nto be studied and discussed separately.\n\nII.\n\nEPI VS NON-PHONONIC MECHANISMS\n\nConcerning the high Tc in cuprates, two dilemmas have\nbeen dominating after its discovery: (i) which interaction\nis responsible for strong quasi-particle scattering in the\nnormal state - this question is related also to the dilemma\nFermi vs non-Fermi liquid; (ii) what is the mediating\n(gluing) boson responsible for the superconducting pairing, i.e. there is a dilemma phonons or non-phonons? In\nthe last twenty-three years, the scientific community was\noverwhelmed by numerous proposed pairing mechanisms,\nmost of which are hardly verifiable in HTSC cuprates.\n1. Fermi vs non-Fermi liquid in cuprates\nAfter discovery of HTSC in cuprates there was a large\namount of evidence on strong scattering of quasi-particles\nwhich contradicts the canonical (popular but narrow)\ndefinition of the Fermi liquid, thus giving rise to numerous proposals of the so called non-Fermi liquids, such\nas Luttinger liquid, RVB theory, marginal Fermi liquid,\netc. In our opinion there is no need for these radical approaches in explaining basic physics in cuprates at least\nin optimally, slightly underdoped and overdoped metallic\nand superconducting HTSC cuprates. Here we give some\nclarifications related to the dilemma of Fermi vs nonFermi liquid. The definition of the canonical Fermi liquid\n(based on the Landau work) in interacting Fermi systems\ncomprises the following properties: (1) there are quasiparticles with charge q = \u00b1e, spin s = 1/2 and low-laying\nenergy excitations \u03be k (= \u01ebk \u2212 \u03bc) which are much larger\nthan their inverse life-times, i.e. \u03be k \u226b 1/\u03c4 k \u223c \u03be 2k /Wb .\nSince the level width \u0393 = 2/\u03c4 k of the quasi-particle is\nnegligibly small, this means that the excited states of\nthe Fermi liquid are placed in one-to-one correspondence\n\nwith the excited states of the free Fermi gas; (2) at T = 0\nK there is an energy level with the Fermi surface at\nwhich \u03be kF = 0 and the Fermi quasi-particle distribution function nF (\u03be k ) has finite jump at kF ; (3) the number of quasi-particles under the Fermi surface is equal to\nthe total number of conduction particles (we omit here\nother valence and core electrons) - the Luttinger theorem; (4) the interaction between quasi-particles are characterized with a few (Landau) parameters which describe\nlow-temperature thermodynamics and transport properties. Having this definition in mind one can say that\nif fermionic quasi-particles interact with some bosonic\nexcitation, for instance with phonons, and if the coupling is sufficiently strong, then the former are not described by the canonical Fermi liquid since at energies\nand temperatures of the order of the characteristic (Debye) temperature kB \u0398D (\u2261 ~\u03c9D ) (for the Debye spectrum \u223c \u0398D /5), i.e. for \u03be k \u223c \u0398D one has \u03c4 \u22121\nk & \u03be k and\nthe quasi-particle picture (in the sense of the Landau\ndefinition) is broken down. In that respect an electronboson system can be classified as a non-canonical Fermi\nliquid for sufficiently strong electron-boson coupling. It\nis nowadays well known that for instance Al, Zn are weak\ncoupling systems since for \u03be k \u223c \u0398D one has \u03c4 \u22121\nk \u226a \u03bek\nand they are well described by the Landau theory. However, in (the non-canonical) cases, where for higher energies \u03be k \u223c \u0398D one has \u03c4 \u22121\nk & \u03be k , the electron-phonon\nsystem is satisfactory described by the Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory and the Boltzmann theory, where thermodynamic\nand transport properties depend on the spectral function\n\u03b12 Fsf (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) and its higher momenta. Since in HTSC\ncuprates the electron-boson (phonon) coupling is strong\nand Tc is large, i.e. of the order of characteristic boson energies (\u03c9 B ), Tc \u223c \u03c9B /5, then it is natural that\nin the normal state (at T > Tc ) we deal with a strong\ninteracting non-canonical Fermi liquid which is for modest non-adiabaticity parameter A < 1 described by the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory, at least qualitatively and semiquantitatively. In order to justify this statement we shall\nin the following elucidate some properties in more details by studying optical, ARPES, tunnelling and other\nexperiments in HTSC oxides.\n2. Is there limitation of the strength of EPI?\nIn spite of reach experimental evidence in favor of\nstrong EPI in HTSC oxides there was a disproportion in\nthe research activity (especially theoretical) in the past,\nsince the investigation of the SFI mechanism of pairing\nprevailed in the literature. This trend was partly due\nto an incorrect statement in [41] on the possible upper\nlimit of Tc in the phonon mechanism of pairing. Since\nin the past we have discussed this problem thoroughly in\nnumerous papers - for the recent one see [42], we shall\noutline here the main issue and results only.\nIt is well known that in an electron-ion crystal, besides\nthe attractive EPI, there is also repulsive Coulomb interaction. In case of an isotropic and homogeneous system\nwith weak quasi-particle interaction, the effective potential Vef f (k, \u03c9) in the leading approximation looks like as\n\n\f6\nfor two external charges (e) embedded in the medium\nwith the total longitudinal dielectric function \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9)\n(k is the momentum and \u03c9 is the frequency) [43], [44],\ni.e.\n4\u03c0e2\nVext (k)\n= 2\n.\nVef f (k, \u03c9) =\n\u03b5tot (k, \u03c9)\nk \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9)\n\n(1)\n\nIn case of strong interaction between quasi-particles,\nthe state of embedded quasi-particles changes significantly due to interaction with other quasi-particles, giving rise to Vef f (k, \u03c9) 6= 4\u03c0e2 /k 2 \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9). In that case\nVef f depends on other (than \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9)) response functions. However, in the case when Eq.(1) holds, i. e.\nwhen the weak-coupling limit is realized, Tc is given by\nTc \u2248 \u03c9\u0304 exp(\u22121/(\u03bbep \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 ) [43], [44], [45]. Here, \u03bbep is\nthe EPI coupling constant, \u03c9\u0304 is an average phonon frequency and \u03bc\u2217 is the Coulomb pseudo-potential, \u03bc\u2217 =\n\u03bc/(1 + \u03bc ln EF /\u03c9\u0304) (EF is the Fermi energy). The couplings \u03bbep and \u03bc are expressed by \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9 = 0)\n\n= N (0)\n\n0\n\n2kF\n\nkdk\n4\u03c0e2\n,\n2kF2 k 2 \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9 = 0)\n\n\u03b5tot (k 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0) < 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThis important theorem invalidates the restriction on the\nmaximal value of Tc in the EPI mechanism given in [41].\nWe stress that the condition \u03b5tot (k 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0) < 0 is not\nin conflict with the lattice stability at all. For instance, in\ninhomogeneous systems such as crystal, the total longitudinal dielectric function is matrix in the space of reciprocal lattice vectors (Q), i.e. \u03b5\u0302tot (k + Q, k + Q\u2032 , \u03c9), and\n\u22121\n\u03b5tot (k, \u03c9) is defined by \u03b5\u22121\ntot (k, \u03c9) = \u03b5\u0302tot (k + 0, k + 0, \u03c9).\nIn dense metallic systems with one ion per cell (such\nas metallic hydrogen) and with the electronic dielectric\nfunction \u03b5el (k, 0) and the macroscopic total dielectric\nfunction \u03b5tot (k, 0) is given by [46]\n\u03b5tot (k, 0) =\n\n\u03b5el (k, 0)\n.\n1 \u2212 1/\u03b5el (k, 0)Gep (k)\n\n(6)\n\nAt the same time the energy of the longitudinal phonon\n\u03c9l (k) is given by\n\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bbep = hN (0)Vef f (k, \u03c9 = 0)i\nZ\n\nor\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N (0) is the density of states at the Fermi surface\nand kF is the Fermi momentum - see more in [2]. In [41]\nit was claimed that lattice stability of the system with\nrespect to the charge density wave formation implies the\ncondition \u03b5tot (k, \u03c9 = 0) > 1 for all k. If this were correct\nthen from Eq.(2) it follows that \u03bc > \u03bbep , which limits the\nmaximal value of Tc to the value Tcmax \u2248 EF exp(\u22124 \u2212\n3/\u03bbep ). In typical metals EF < (1 \u2212 10) eV and if one\naccepts the statement in [41] that \u03bbep \u2264 \u03bc(\u2264 0.5), one\nobtains Tc \u223c (1 \u2212 10) K. The latter result, if it would\nbe correct, means that EPI is ineffective in producing not\nonly high-Tc superconductivity but also low-temperature\nsuperconductivity (LTS with Tc . 20 K). However, this\nresult is in conflict first of all with experimental results\nin LTSC, where in numerous systems one has \u03bc \u2264 \u03bbep\nand \u03bbep > 1. For instance, \u03bbep \u2248 2.6 is realized in P bBi\nalloy which is definitely much higher than \u03bc(< 1), etc.\nMoreover, the basic theory tells us that \u03b5tot (k 6= 0, \u03c9)\nis not the response function [43], [44] (contrary to the\nassumption in [41]). Namely, if a small external potential \u03b4Vext (k, \u03c9) is applied to the system (of electrons\nand ions in solids) it induces screening by charges of the\nmedium and the total potential is given by \u03b4Vtot (k, \u03c9) =\n\u03b4Vext (k, \u03c9)/\u03b5tot (k, \u03c9) which means that 1/\u03b5tot (k, \u03c9) is\nthe response function. The latter obeys the KramersKronig dispersion relation which implies the following\nstability condition [43], [44]\n1/\u03b5tot (k, \u03c9 = 0) < 1, k 6= 0,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b5tot (k 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0) > 1\n\n(4)\n\ni.e. either\n\n\u03c9 2l (k) =\n\n\u03a92p\n[1 \u2212 \u03b5el (k, 0)Gep (k)],\n\u03b5el (k, 0)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03a92p is the ionic plasma frequency, Gep is the local\n(electric) field correction - see Ref. [46]. The right condition for lattice stability requires that \u03c9 2l (k) > 0, which\nimplies that for \u03b5el (k, 0) > 0 one has \u03b5el (k, 0)Gep (k) < 1.\nThe latter condition gives automatically \u03b5tot (k, 0) < 0.\nFurthermore, the calculations [46] show that in the metallic hydrogen (H) crystal, \u03b5tot (k, 0) < 0 for all k 6= 0.\nNote, that in metallic H the EPI coupling constant is\nvery large, i.e \u03bbep \u2248 7 and Tc may reach very large value\nTc \u2248 600 K [47]. Moreover, the analyzes of crystals with\nmore ions per unit cell [46] gives that \u03b5tot (k 6= 0, 0) < 0 is\nmore a rule than an exception - see Fig. 1. The physical\nreason for \u03b5tot (k 6= 0, 0) < 0 are local field effects described by Gep (k). Whenever the local electric field Eloc\nacting on electrons (and ions) is different from the average electric field E, i.e. Eloc 6= E, there are corrections\nto \u03b5tot (k, 0) which may lead to \u03b5tot (k, 0) < 0.\n\nThe above analysis tells us that in real crystals\n\u03b5tot (k, 0) can be negative in the large portion of the Brillouin zone giving rise to \u03bbep \u2212 \u03bc > 0 in Eq.(2). This\nmeans that analytic properties of the dielectric function\n\u03b5tot do not limit Tc in the phonon mechanism of pairing.\nThis result does not mean that there is no limit on Tc\nat all. We mention in advance that the local field effects\nplay important role in HTSC oxides, due to their layered\nstructure with very unusual ionic-metallic binding, thus\nopening a possibility for large EP I.\nIn conclusion, we point out that there are no serious\ntheoretical and experimental arguments for ignoring EPI\nin HTSC cuprates. To this end it is necessary to answer\n\n\f7\nthen near Tc the linearized Eliashberg equations have an\napproximative form for a weak non\u2013phonon interaction\n(with the large characteristic frequency \u03a9nph )\n\u03a9nph\n\nZ(\u03c9 n )\u2206n (k) \u2248 \u03c0Tc\n\nXX\nm\n\nVnph (k, q, n, m)\n\nq\n\n\u2206m (q)\n|\u03c9n\u2032 |\n\nZ(\u03c9n ) \u2248 1 + \u0393ep /\u03c9n .\n\n(8)\n\nFor pure d-wave pairing with the pairing potential\nVnph = Vnph (\u03b8 k , \u03b8 q ) * \u0398(\u03a9nph \u2212 |\u03c9 n |)\u0398(\u03a9nph \u2212 |\u03c9 n\u2032 |)\nwith Vnph (k, q) = V0 * Yd (\u03b8k )Yd (\u03b8 q ) and Yd (\u03b8k ) =\n\u03c0 \u22121/2 cos 2\u03b8k one obtains \u2206n (k) = \u2206d * \u0398(\u03a9nph \u2212\n|\u03c9n |)Yd (\u03b8 k ) and the equation for Tc - see [2]\nln\n\nFIG. 1.

(2) Why is the transport EPI coupling constant \u03bbtr (entering resistivity) rather smaller than the\npairing EPI coupling constant \u03bbep (> 1) (entering Tc ),\ni.e. why one has \u03bbtr (\u2248 0.6 \u2212 1.4) \u226a \u03bbep (\u223c 2 \u2212 3.5)? (3)\nIf EPI is ineffective for pairing in HTSC oxides, in spite\nof \u03bbep > 1, why it is so?\n3. Is a non-phononic pairing realized in HTSC?\nRegarding EPI one can pose a question - whether it\ncontributes significantly to d-wave pairing in cuprates?\nSurprisingly, despite numerous experiments in favor of\nEPI, there is a believe that EPI is irrelevant for pairing\n[7]. This belief is mainly based first, on the above discussed incorrect lattice stability criterion related to the\nsign of \u03b5tot (k, 0), which implies small EPI and second, on\nthe well established experimental fact that d-wave pairing is realized in cuprates [48], which is believed to be incompatible with EPI. Having in mind that EPI in HTSC\nat and near optimal dopimng is strong with 2 < \u03bbep < 3.5\n(see below), we assume for the moment that the leading pairing mechanism in cuprates, which gives d-wave\npairing, is due to some non-phononic mechanism. For\ninstance, let us assume an exitonic mechanism due to\nthe high energy pairing boson (\u03a9nph \u226b \u03c9 ph ) and with\nthe bare critical temperature Tc0 and look for the effect\nof EPI on Tc . If EPI is approximately isotropic, like in\nmost LTSC materials, then it would be very detrimental\nfor d-wave pairing. In the case of dominating isotropic\nEPI in the normal state and the exitonic-like pairing,\n\nTc\n1\n1\n\u0393ep\n\u2248 \u03a8( ) \u2212 \u03a8( +\n).\nTc0\n2\n2 2\u03c0Tc\n\n(9)\n\nHere \u03a8 is the di-gamma function. At temperatures\nnear Tc one has \u0393ep \u2248 2\u03c0\u03bbep Tc and the solution of\nEq. (9) is approximately Tc \u2248 Tc0 exp{\u2212\u03bbep } with\nTc0 \u2248 \u03a9nph exp{\u2212\u03bbnph }, \u03bbnph = N (0)V0 . This means\nthat for Tcmax \u223c 160 K and \u03bbep > 1 the bare Tc0 due\nto the non-phononic interaction must be very large, i.e.\nTc0 > 500 K.\nConcerning other non-phononic mechanisms, such as\nthe SFI one, the effect of EPI in the framework of Eliashberg equations was studied numerically in [49]. The\nlatter is based on Eqs.(99-101) in Appendix A. with\nthe kernels in the normal and superconducting chan\u2206\nnels \u03bbZ\nkp (i\u03bd n ) and \u03bbkp , respectively. Usually, the spinfluctuation kernel \u03bbsf,kp (i\u03bd n ) is taken in the FLEX approximation [50]. The calculations [49] confirm the very\ndetrimental effect of the isotropic (k-independent) EPI\non d-wave pairing due to SFI. For the bare SFI critical\ntemperature Tc0 \u223c 100 K and for \u03bbep > 1 the calculations give very small (renormalized) critical temperature\nTc \u226a 100 K. These results tell us that a more realistic pairing interaction must be operative in cuprates and\nthat EPI must be strongly momentum dependent [51].\nOnly in that case is strong EPI conform with d-wave\npairing, either as its main cause or as a supporter of\na non-phononic mechanism. In Part II we shall argue\nthat the strongly momentum dependent EPI is important\nscattering mechanism in cuprates providing the strength\nof the pairing mechanism, while the residual Coulomb interaction (by including weaker SFI) triggers it to d-wave\npairing.\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR\nSTRONG EPI\n\nIn the following we discuss some important experiments which give evidence for strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in cuprates. However, before doing it,\nwe shall discuss some indicative inelastic magnetic neutron scattering measurements (IMNS) in cuprates whose\n\n\f8\nresults in fact seriously doubt in the effectiveness of the\nphenomenological SFI mechanism of pairing which is advocated in [7], [52]. First, the experimental results related to the pronounced imaginary part of the susceptibility Im\u03c7(k, kz , \u03c9) in the normal state at and near\nthe AF wave vector k = Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) were interpreted in\na number of papers as a support for the SFI mechanism\nfor pairing [7], [52]. Second, the existence of the so called\nmagnetic resonance peak of Im\u03c7(k, kz , \u03c9) (at some energies \u03c9 < 2\u2206) in the superconducting state was also\ninterpreted in a number of papers either as the origin of\nsuperconductivity or as a mechanism strongly affecting\nsuperconducting gap at the ant-nodal point.\nA.\n\nMagnetic neutron scattering and the spin\nfluctuation spectral function\n\na. Huge rearrangement of the SFI spectral function\nand little change of Tc\nBefore discussing experimental results in cuprates on\nthe imaginary part of the spin susceptibility Im\u03c7(k, \u03c9)\nwe point out that in (phenomenological) theories based\non spin fluctuation interaction (SFI) the quasi-particle\nself-energy \u03a3\u0302sf (k, \u03c9 n ) (\u03c9 n is the Matsubara frequency\nand \u03c4\u0302 0 is the Nambu matrix) in the normal and superconducting state and the effective (repulsive) pairing potential Vsf (k, \u03c9) (where i\u03c9 n \u2192 \u03c9 + i\u03b7) are assumed in\nthe form [7]\n\u03a3\u0302sf (k, \u03c9 n ) =\n\nT X\nVsf (k \u2212 k\u2032 , \u03c9 n \u2212\u03c9 m )\u03c4\u0302 0 \u011c(k\u2032 , \u03c9 m )\u03c4\u0302 0 ,\nN \u2032\nk ,m\n\n2\nVsf (k, \u03c9 n ) = gsf\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+\n\nd\u03bd Im\u03c7(q, \u03bd + i0 )\n.\n\u03c0\n\u03bd \u2212 i\u03c9n\n\n(10)\n\nAlthough the form of Vsf can not be justified theoretically, except in the weak coupling limit (gsf \u226a Wb )\nonly, it is used in the analysis of the quasi-particle\nproperties in the normal and superconducting state of\ncuprates where the spin susceptibility (spectral function)\nIm\u03c7(q, \u03c9) is strongly peaked at and near the AF wave\nvector Q = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a). Can the pairing mechanism\nin HTSC cuprates be explained by such a phenomenology and what is the prise for it? The best answer is\nto look at the experimental results related to inelastic\nmagnetic neutron scattering (IMNS) experiments which\ngive Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9). In that respect very indicative and impressive IMNS measurements on Y Ba2 Cu3 O6+x , which\nare done by Bourges group [18], demonstrate clearly that\nthe normal state susceptibility Im\u03c7(odd) (q, \u03c9) (the odd\npart of the spin susceptibility in the bilayer system) at\nq = Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) is strongly dependent on the hole doping\nas it is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe most pronounced result for our discussion is that\nby varying doping there is a huge rearrangement of\nIm\u03c7(odd) (Q, \u03c9) in the normal state, especially in the energy (frequency) region which might be important for\n\nFIG. 2. Magnetic spectral function Im\u03c7(\u2212) (k, \u03c9) in the\nnormal state of Y Ba2 Cu3 O6+x at T = 100 K and at\nQ = (\u03c0, \u03c0). 100 counts in the vertical scale corresponds to\n2\n\u03c7(\u2212)\nmax \u2248 350\u03bc B /eV . From Ref. [18].\n\nsuperconducting pairing, let say 0 meV < \u03c9 < 60 meV .\nThis is clearly seen in the last two curves in Fig. 2\nwhere this rearrangement is very pronounced, while at\nthe same time there is only small variation of the critical temperature Tc . It is seen in Fig. 2 that in the\nunderdoped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.92 crystal Im\u03c7(odd) (Q, \u03c9) and\nR 60\n2\n(odd)\nS(Q) = N (\u03bc)gsf\n(Q, \u03c9) are much larger\n0 d\u03c9Im\u03c7\nthan that in the near optimally doped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.97 ,\ni.e. one has S6.92 (Q) \u226b S6.97 (Q), although the difference in the corresponding critical temperatures Tc is\n(6.92)\nvery small, i.e. Tc\n= 91 K (in Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.92 ) and\n(6.97)\nTc\n= 92.5 K (in Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.97 ). This pronounced\nrearrangement and suppression of Im\u03c7(odd) (Q, \u03c9) (in the\nnormal state of YBCO) by doping toward the optimal\ndoping but with negligible change in Tc is strong evidence\nthat the SF I pairing mechanism is not the dominating\none in HTSC cuprates. This insensitivity of Tc , if inter2\n),\npreted in term of the SF I coupling constant \u03bbsf (\u223c gsf\n(exp)\n\nmeans that the latter is small, i.e. \u03bbsf\n\n\u226a 1. We\n\n\f9\nstress that the explanation of high Tc in cuprates by\nthe SFI phenomenological theory [7] assumes very large\n(th)\nSFI coupling energy with gsf \u2248 0.7 eV while the frequency(energy) dependence of Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) is extracted\nfrom the fit of the NMR relaxation rate T1\u22121 which gives\n(N MR)\n\u2248 100 K [7]. To this point, the NMR meaTc\nsurements (of T1\u22121 ) give that there is an anti-correlation\nbetween the decrease of the NMR spectral function IQ =\nlim\u03c9\u21920 Im\u03c7(N MR) (Q, \u03c9)/\u03c9 and the increase of Tc by increasing doping toward the optimal one - see [3] and\nReferences therein. The latter result additionally disfavors the SFI model of pairing [7] since the strength of\npairing interaction is little affected by SFI. Note, that if\ninstead of taking Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) from NMR measurements\none takes it from IMNS measurements, as it was done\n(th)\nin [53], than for the same value gsf one obtains much\nsmaller Tc . For instance, by taking the experimental values for Im\u03c7(IMN S) (Q, \u03c9) in underdoped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.6\n(IMN S)\n(N MR)\nwith Tc \u2248 60 K one obtains Tc\n< Tc\n/3\n(IMN S)\n(th)\n[53], while Tc\n\u2192 50 K for gsf \u226b 1. The situation is even worse if one trays to fit the resistivity with\nIm\u03c7(IMN S) (Q, \u03c9) in Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.6 since this fit gives\n(IMN S)\n< 7 K. These results point to a deficiency of\nTc\nthe SFI phenomenology (at least that based on Eq.(10))\nto describe pairing in HTSC cuprates.\nHaving in mind the results in [53], the recent theoretical interpretation in [52] of IMNS experiments [54]\nand ARPES measurements [55] on the underdoped\nY Ba2 Cu3 O6.6 in terms of the SFI phenomenology deserve to be commented. The IMNS experiments [54]\ngive evidence for the \"hourglass\" spin excitation spectrum (in the superconducting state) for the momenta\nq at, near and far from Q, which is richer than the\ncommon spectrum with magnetic resonance peaks measured at Q. In [52] the self-energy of electrons due to\ntheir interaction with spin excitations is calculated by\n2\nusing Eq. (10) with gsf\n= (3/2)\u0168 2 and Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) taken\nfrom [54]. However, in order to fit the ARPES selfenergy and low-energy kinks (see discussion in Section\nC) the authors of [52] use very large value \u0168 = 1.59\neV , i.e. much larger than the one used in [53]. Such a\nlarge value of \u0168 has been used earlier within the Monte\nCarlo simulation and the fit of the Hubbard model [56].\nIn our opinion this value for \u0168 is unrealistically large\nin the case of strongly correlated systems where spinfluctuations are governed by the effective electron exchange interaction JCu\u2212Cu . 0.15 eV [57]. This implies\nthat \u0168 \u226a 1 eV and Tc \u226a 10 K. Note, that this value\nfor JCu\u2212Cu comes out also from the theory of strongly\ncorrelated electrons in the three-band Emery model with\nJCu\u2212Cu \u2248 (4t4pd /(\u2206dp + Upd )2 )[(1/Ud ) + 2/(Up + 2\u2206)] for parameters see Part II Section VII.\nConcerning the problem related to the rearrangement\nof the SFI spectral function Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) in Y B2 Cu3 O6+x\n[18] we would like to stress, that in spite that the latter results were obtained ten years ago they are not dis-\n\nputed by the new IMNS measurements [19] on high quality samples of the same compound (where much longer\ncounting times were used in order to reduce statistical\nerrors). In fact the results in [18] are confirmed in [19]\nwhere the magnetic intensity I(q, \u03c9)(\u223c Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9)) (for\nq at and in the broad range of Q) for the optimally\ndoped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.95 (with Tc = 93 K) is at least three\ntimes smaller than in the underoped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.6 with\nTc = 60 K. This result is again very indicative sign\nof the weakness of SFI since such a huge reconstruction\nwould decrease Tc in the optimally doped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.95\nif analyzed in the framework of the phenomenological SFI\ntheory based on Eq. (10). It also implies that due to the\nsuppression of Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) by increasing doping toward\nthe optimal one a straightforward extrapolation of the\ntheoretical approach in [52] to the explanation of Tc in\nthe optimally doped Y Ba2 Cu3 O6.95 would require an increase of \u0168 to the value even larger than 4 eV , what is\nhighly improbable.\nb. Ineffectiveness of the magnetic resonance peak\nA less direct argument for smallness of the SFI couexp\nexp\npling constant, i.e. gsf\n\u2264 0.2 eV and gsf\n\u226a gsf\ncomes from other experiments related to the magnetic\nresonance peak in the superconducting state, and this\nwill be discussed next. In the superconducting state of\noptimally doped YBCO and BISCO, Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) is significantly suppressed at low frequencies except near the\nresonance energy \u03c9res \u2248 41 meV where a pronounced\nnarrow peak appears - the magnetic resonance peak. We\nstress that there is no magnetic resonance peak in some\nfamilies of HTSC cuprates, for instance in LSCO, and\nconsequently one can question the importance of the resonance peak in the scattering processes. The experiments\ntell us that the relative intensity of this peak (compared\nto the total one) is small, i.e. I0 \u223c (1 \u2212 5)% - see Fig 3.\nIn underdoped cuprates this peak is present also in the\nnormal state as it is seen in Fig 2.\nAfter the discovery of the resonance peak there were\nattempts to relate it first, to the origin of the superconducting condensation energy and second, to the kink\nin the energy dispersion or the peak-dimp structure in\nthe ARPES spectral function. In order that the condensation energy is due to the magnetic resonance it is\nnecessary that the peak intensity I0 is small [58]. I0\nis obtained approximately by equating the condensation energy Econ \u2248 N (0)\u22062 /2 with the change of the\nmagnetic energy Emag in the superconducting state, i.e.\n\u03b4Emag \u2248 4I0 * Emag\nZZ\nd\u03c9d2 k\nEmag = J\n(1 \u2212 cos kx \u2212 cos ky )S(k, \u03c9). (11)\n(2\u03c0)3\nBy taking \u2206 \u2248 2Tc and the realistic value N (0) \u223c\n1/(10J) \u223c 1 states/eV * spin, one obtains I0 \u223c\n10\u22121 (Tc /J)2 \u223c 10\u22123 . However, such a small intensity\ncan not be responsible for the anomalies in ARPES and\noptical spectra since it gives rise to small coupling constant \u03bbsf,res for the interaction of holes with the reso2\nnance peak, i.e. \u03bbsf,res \u2248 (2I0 N (0)gsf\n/\u03c9res ) \u226a 1. Such\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 3. Magnetic spectral function Im\u03c7(\u2212) (k, \u03c9) in the superconducting state of Y Ba2 Cu3 O6+x at T = 5 K and at\nQ = (\u03c0, \u03c0). 100 counts in the vertical scale corresponds to\n2\n\u03c7(\u2212)\nmax \u2248 350\u03bc B /eV . From Ref. [18].\n\na small coupling does not affect superconductivity at all.\nMoreover, by studying the width of the resonance peak\none can extract order of magnitude of the SFI coupling\nconstant gsf . Since the magnetic resonance disappears in\nthe normal state of the optimally doped YBCO it can be\nqualitatively understood by assuming that its broadening\nscales with the resonance energy \u03c9 res , i.e. \u03b3 res < \u03c9 res ,\nwhere the line-width is given by \u03b3 res = 4\u03c0(N (0)gsf )2 \u03c9 res\n[58]. This condition limits the SFI coupling to gsf < 0.2\neV . We stress that the obtained gsf is much smaller\n(at least by factor three) than that assumed in the phenomenological spin-fluctuation theory [7] and [52] where\ngsf \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.7 eV and \u0168 \u2248 1.6 eV , but much larger\nthan estimated in [58] (where gsf < 0.02 eV ). The smallness of gsf comes out also from the analysis of the antiferromagnetic state in underdoped metals of LSCO and\nYBCO [59], where the small (ordered) magnetic moment\n\u03bc(< 0.1 \u03bcB ) points to an itinerant antiferromagnetism\nwith small coupling constant gsf < 0.2 eV . The con-\n\nclusion from this analysis is that in the optimally doped\nYBCO the sharp magnetic resonance is a consequence of\nthe onset of superconductivity and not its cause. There\nis also one principal reason against the pairing due to\nthe magnetic resonance peak at least in optimally doped\ncuprates. Since the intensity of the magnetic resonance\nnear Tc is vanishingly small, though not affecting pairing at the second order phase transition at Tc , then if it\nwould be solely the origin for superconductivity the phase\ntransition at Tc would be first order, contrary to experiments. Recent ARPES experiments give evidence that\nthe magnetic resonance cannot be related to the kinks in\nARPES spectra [60], [61] - see the discussion below.\nFinally, we would like to point out that the recent\nmagnetic neutron scattering measurements on optimallydoped large-volume crystals Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 [62],\nwhere the absolute value of Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) is measured, are\nquestioning the interpretation of the electronic magnetism in cuprates in terms of itinerant magnetism. This\nexperiment shows a lack of temperature dependence\nof\nP\nthe local spin susceptibility Im\u03c7(\u03c9) =\nq Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9)\nacross the superconducting transition Tc = 91 K, i.e\nthere is only a minimal change in Im\u03c7(\u03c9) between 10 K\nand 100 K. Note, if the magnetic excitations were due\nto itinerant quasi-particles we should have seen dramatic\nchanges of Im\u03c7(\u03c9) as a function of T over the whole\nenergy range. This T -independence of Im\u03c7(\u03c9) strongly\nopposes many theoretical results in [13], [14], [15] which\nassume that the bosonic spectral function is proportional\nto Im\u03c7(\u03c9) that can be extracted from optic measurements. This procedure gives that Im\u03c7(\u03c9) is strongly\nT -dependent contrary to the experimental results in [62]\n- see more in Subsection B on optical conductivity.\n\nB.\n\nOptical conductivity and EPI\n\nOptical spectroscopy gives information on optical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) and on two-particle excitations, from\nwhich one can indirectly extract the transport spectral\nfunction \u03b12tr F (\u03c9). Since this method probes bulk sample (on the skin depth), contrary to ARPES and tunnelling methods which probe tiny regions (10 \u2212 15 \u00c5)\nnear the sample surface, this method is indispensable.\nHowever, one should be careful not over-interpreting the\nexperimental results since \u03c3(\u03c9) is not a directly measured\nquantity but it is derived from the reflectivity R(\u03c9) =\n2\np\np\n( \u03b5ii (\u03c9) \u2212 1)/( \u03b5ii (\u03c9) + 1) with the transversal dielectric tensor \u03b5ii (\u03c9) = \u03b5ii,\u221e + \u03b5ii,latt + 4\u03c0i\u03c3 ii (\u03c9)/\u03c9.\nHere, \u03b5ii,\u221e is the high frequency dielectric function,\n\u03b5ii,latt describes the contribution of the lattice vibrations\nand \u03c3 ii (\u03c9) describes the optical (dynamical) conductivity\nof conduction carriers. Since R(\u03c9) is usually measured\nin the limited frequency interval \u03c9 min < \u03c9 < \u03c9 max some\nphysical modelling for R(\u03c9) is needed in order to guess it\noutside this range - see more in reviews [2], [3]. This was\nthe reason for numerous misinterpretations of optic mea-\n\n\f11\nsurements in cuprates, that will be uncover below. An\nillustrative example for this claim is large dispersion in\nthe reported value of \u03c9 pl - from 0.06 to 25 eV , i.e. almost\nthree orders of magnitude. However, it turns out that IR\nmeasurements of R(\u03c9) in conjunction with elipsometric\nmeasurements of \u03b5ii (\u03c9) at high frequencies allows more\nreliable determination of \u03c3(\u03c9) [63].\n1. Transport and quasi-particle relaxation rates\nThe widespread misconception in studying the quasiparticle scattering in cuprates was an ad hoc assumption\nthat the transport relaxation rate \u03b3 tr (\u03c9) is equal to the\nquasi-particle relaxation rate \u03b3(\u03c9), in spite of the well\nknown fact that the inequality \u03b3 tr (\u03c9) 6= \u03b3(\u03c9) holds in\na broad frequency (energy) region [20]. This (incorrect)\nassumption was one of the main arguments against EPI\nas relevant scattering mechanism in cuprates. Although\nwe have discussed this problem several times before, we\ndo it again due to the importance of this subject.\nThe dynamical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) consists of two parts,\ni.e. \u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c3 inter (\u03c9) + \u03c3 intra (\u03c9) where \u03c3 inter (\u03c9) describes inter-band transitions which contribute at higher\nthan intra-band energies, while \u03c3 intra (\u03c9) is due to intraband transitions which are relevant at low energies \u03c9 <\n(1 \u2212 2) eV . (Note, that in the IR measurements the frequency is usually given in cm\u22121 , where the following conversion holds 1cm\u22121 = 29.98 GHz = 0.123985 meV =\n1.44 K.) The experimental data for \u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c3 1 + i\u03c3 2\nin cuprates are usually processed by the generalized (extended) Drude formula [20], [21], [22], [64],\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9 2p\n1\n1\n\u2261\n,\n4\u03c0 \u03b3 tr (\u03c9) \u2212 i\u03c9mtr (\u03c9)/m\u221e\n\u03c9\u0303 tr (\u03c9)\n\nm\u221e\nIm\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) =\n,\nmtr (\u03c9)\n\u03c9Re\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\n0\n\n(14)\n\nl\n\nwith the Kernel K(x, y) = (i/y) + {((y \u2212 x)/x)[\u03c8(1 \u2212\nix + iy) \u2212 \u03c8(1 + iy)]} \u2212 {y \u2192 \u2212y} where \u03c8 is the digamma function. In the presence of impurity scattering\none should add \u03b3 imp,tr to \u03b3 tr . It turns out that Eq.(14)\nholds within a few percents also for large \u03bbep (> 1). Note,\nthat \u03b12tr,l Fl (\u03bd) 6= \u03b12l Fl (\u03bd) and the index l enumerates all\nscattering bosons - phonons, spin fluctuations, etc. For\ncomparison, the quasi-particle scattering rate \u03b3(\u03c9, T ) is\ngiven by\n\u03b3(\u03c9, T ) = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03bd\u03b12 F (\u03bd){2nB (\u03bd)\n\n0\n\n+ nF (\u03bd + \u03c9) + nF (\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9)} + \u03b3 imp ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere nF is the Fermi distribution function.

However, this procedure is inadequate\nfor interpreting optical data in multi-band systems such\nas new high-temperature superconductors Fe-based pnictides since even in absence of the inelastic intra- and\ninter-band scattering the effective optic relaxation rate\nmay be strongly frequency dependent [65].

By\ncomparing Eq.(14) and Eq.(15), it is seen that \u03b3 tr and\n\u03b3 are different quantities, i.e. \u03b3 tr 6= \u03b3, where the former describes the relaxation of Bose particles (excited\nelectron-hole pairs) while the latter one describes the relaxation of Fermi particles. This difference persists also\nat T = 0 K where one has (due to simplicity we omit in\nthe following summation over l ) [20]\nZ\n2\u03c0 \u03c9\n\u03b3 tr (\u03c9) =\nd\u03bd(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bd)\u03b12tr (\u03bd)F (\u03bd)\n(17)\n\u03c9 0\nand\n\u03b3(\u03c9) = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\n\nd\u03bd\u03b12 (\u03bd)F (\u03bd).\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\nIn the case of EPI with the constant electronic density\nof states, the above equations give that \u03b3 ep (\u03c9) = const\n\u2217\nfor \u03c9 > \u03c9 max\nph while \u03b3 ep,tr (\u03c9) (as well as \u03b3 ep,tr ) is monomax\nmax\ntonic growing for \u03c9 > \u03c9ph , where \u03c9 ph is the maximal phonon frequency. So, the growing of \u03b3 ep,tr (\u03c9) (and\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 4.

This behavior is clearly seen by comparing \u03b3(\u03c9, T ), \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) and \u03b3 \u2217tr which are calculated for\nthe EPI spectral function \u03b12ep (\u03c9)Fph (\u03c9) extracted from\ntunnelling experiments in YBCO (with \u03c9 max\nph \u223c 80 meV )\n[27] - see Fig. 4.\nThe results shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate the\nphysical difference between two scattering rates \u03b3 ep and\n\u03b3 ep,tr (and \u03b3 \u2217tr ). It is also seen that \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T ) is even more\n\nlinear function of \u03c9 than \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ). From these calculations one concludes that the quasi-linearity of \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T )\n(and \u03b3 \u2217tr ) is not in contradiction with the EPI scattering mechanism but it is in fact a natural consequence\nof EPI. We stress that such behavior of \u03b3 ep and \u03b3 ep,tr\n(and \u03b3 \u2217ep,tr ), shown in Fig. 4, is in fact not exceptional\nfor HTSC cuprates but it is generic for many metallic\nsystems, for instance 3D metallic oxides, low temperature superconductors such as Al, P b, etc. - see more in\n[2], [3] and References therein.\nLet us discuss briefly the experimental results for R(\u03c9)\nand \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T ) and compare these with theoretical predictions obtained by using a single band model with\n\u03b12ep (\u03c9)Fph (\u03c9) extracted from the tunnelling data with\nthe EPI coupling constant \u03bbep & 2 [27]. In the case of\nYBCO the agreement between measured and calculated\nR(\u03c9) is very good up to energies \u03c9 < 6000 cm\u22121 which\nconfirms the importance of EPI in scattering processes.\nFor higher energies, where a mead-infrared peak appears,\nit is necessary to account for inter-band transitions [2].\nIn optimally doped Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O6 (Bi \u2212 2212) [66]\nthe experimental results for \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T ) are explained theoretically by assuming that the EPI spectral function\n\u03b12ep (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) \u223c Fph (\u03c9), where Fph (\u03c9) is the phononic density of states in BISCO while \u03b12ep (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c91.6 , \u03bbep = 1.9\nand \u03b3 imp \u2248 320 cm\u22121 - see Fig. 5(top). The agreement\nis rather good. At the same time the fit of \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T ) by\nthe marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology fails as it is\nevident in Fig. 5(bottom).\nNow we will comment the so called pronounced linear behavior of \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) (and \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T )) which was one\nof the main arguments for numerous inadequate conclusions regarding the scattering and pairing bosons and\nEPI. We stress again that the measured quantity is reflectivity R(\u03c9) and derived ones are \u03c3(\u03c9), \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) and\nmtr (\u03c9), which are very sensitive to the value of the dielectric constant \u03b5\u221e . This sensitivity is clearly demonstrated\nin Fig. 6 for Bi-2212 where it is seen that \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) (and\n\u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T )) for \u03b5\u221e = 1 is linear up to much higher \u03c9 than\nin the case \u03b5\u221e > 1.\nHowever, in some experiments [67], [68] the extracted\n\u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) (and \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T )) is linear up to very high \u03c9 \u2248\n1500 cm\u22121 . This means that the ion background and\ninter-band transitions (contained in \u03b5\u221e ) are not properly\ntaken into account since too small \u03b5\u221e (& 1) is assumed.\nThe recent elipsometric measurements on YBCO [69] give\nthe value \u03b5\u221e \u2248 4 \u2212 6, which gives much less spectacular\nlinearity in the relaxation rates \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) (and \u03b3 \u2217tr (\u03c9, T ))\nthan it was the case immediately after the discovery of\nHTSC cuprates, where much smaller \u03b5\u221e was assumed.\nFurthermore, we would like to comment on two points\nconcerning \u03c3, \u03b3 tr , \u03b3 and their interrelations. First, the\nparametrization of \u03c3(\u03c9) with the generalized Drude formula in Eq.(12) and its relation to the transport scattering rate \u03b3 tr (\u03c9, T ) and the transport mass mtr (\u03c9, T ) is\nuseful if we deal with electron-boson scattering in a single band problem. In [22], [65] it is shown that \u03c3(\u03c9) of\na two-band model with only elastic impurity scattering\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 6.

In order to give the physical picture\nand qualitative explanation for this difference we assume\nthat \u03b12tr F (\u03bd) \u2248 \u03b12 F (\u03bd). In that case the renormalized\nquasi-particle frequency \u03c9\u0303(\u03c9) = Z(\u03c9)\u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a3(\u03c9) and\nthe transport one \u03c9\u0303tr (\u03c9) - defined in Eq.(12), are related\nand at T = 0 they are given by [20], [22]\nZ\n1 \u03c9 \u2032\n\u03c9\u0303tr (\u03c9) =\nd\u03c9 2\u03c9\u0303(\u03c9 \u2032 ).\n(19)\n\u03c9 0\n(For the definition of Z(\u03c9) see Appendix A.)

If the electron has energy \u03c9\u2032 and the hole \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2032 , then they relax as\nquasi-particles with the renormalized frequency \u03c9\u0303. Since\n\u03c9\u2032 takes values 0 < \u03c9 \u2032 < \u03c9 then the optical relaxation\n\u03c9\u0303tr (\u03c9) is the energy-averaged \u03c9\u0303(\u03c9) according to Eq.(19).\nThe factor 2 is due to the two quasi-particles - electron\nand hole. At finite T , the generalization reads [20], [22]\nZ\n1 \u221e \u2032\nd\u03c9 [1 \u2212 nF (\u03c9 \u2032 ) \u2212 nF (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )]2\u03c9\u0303(\u03c9 \u2032 ).\n\u03c9\u0303tr (\u03c9) =\n\u03c9 0\n(22)\n2. Inversion of the optical data and \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9)\n\n\f14\nIn principle, the transport spectral function\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) can be extracted from \u03c3(\u03c9) (or \u03b3 tr (\u03c9))\nonly at T = 0 K, which follows from Eq.( 17)\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9 2p \u2202 2\n1\n[\u03c9Re\n],\n8\u03c0 2 \u2202\u03c9 2\n\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\n(23)\n\nor equivalently \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) = (1/2\u03c0)\u2202 2 (\u03c9\u03b3 tr (\u03c9))/\u2202\u03c92 .\nHowever, real measurements are performed at finite T\n(at T > Tc which is rather high in HTSC cuprates)\nand the inversion procedure is an ill-posed problem since\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is the de-convolution of the inhomogeneous\nFredholm integral equation of the first kind with the temperature dependent Kernel K2 (\u03c9, \u03bd, T ) - see Eq.(14). It\nis known that an ill-posed mathematical problem is very\nsensitive to input since experimental data contain less information than one needs. This procedure can cause first,\nthat the fine structure of \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) gets blurred (most\npeaks are washed out) in the extraction procedures and\nsecond, the extracted \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is temperature dependent even when the true \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is T independent.\nThis artificial T -dependence is especially pronounced in\nHTSC cuprates because Tc (\u223c 100 K) is very high. In the\ncontext of HTSC cuprates, this problem was first studied in [21], [22] where this picture is confirmed by the\nfollowing results: (1 ) the extracted shape of \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9)\nin Y Ba2 Cu3 O7\u2212x (and other cuprates) is not unique and\nit is temperature dependent, i.e. at higher T > Tc the\npeak structure is smeared and only a single peak (slightly\nshifted to higher \u03c9) is present. For instance, the experimental data of R(\u03c9) in YBCO were reproduced by two\ndifferent spectral functions \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9), one with single\npeak and the other one with three peaks structure as it is\nshown in Fig. 7, where all spectral functions give almost\nidentical R(\u03c9). The similar situation is realized in optimally doped BISCO as it is seen in Fig. 8 where again\ndifferent functions \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) reproduce very well curves\nfor R(\u03c9) and \u03c3(\u03c9). However, it is important to stress\nthat the obtained width of the extracted \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) in\nboth compounds coincide with the width of the phonon\ndensity of states Fph (\u03c9) [21], [22], [70]. (2 ) The upper\nenergy bound for \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is extracted in [21], [22] and\nit coincides approximately with the maximal phonon frequency in cuprates \u03c9max\nph . 80 meV as it is seen in Figs.\n7-8.\nThese results demonstrate the importance of EPI in\ncuprates [21], [22]. We point out that the width of\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) which is extracted from the optical measurements [21], [22] coincides with the width of the quasiparticle spectral function \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) obtained in tunnelling and ARPES spectra (which we shall discuss below), i.e. both functions are spread over the energy interval 0 < \u03c9 < \u03c9 max\nph (. 80 meV ). Since in cuprates this\ninterval coincides with the width in the phononic density of states F (\u03c9) and since the maxima of \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9)\nand F (\u03c9) almost coincide, this is further evidence for the\nimportance of EPI.\nTo this end, we would like to comment two aspects\nwhich appear from time to time in the literature. First, in\n\nFIG. 7. Experimental (solid lines) and calculated (dashed\nlines) of R(\u03c9) in optimally doped YBCO [71] at T=100, 200,\n300 K (from top to bottom). Inset: the two (solid and dashed\nlines) reconstructed \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) at T=100 K. The phonon\ndensity of states F (\u03c9) - dotted line in the inset. From [21].\n\nFIG. 8. Experimental (solid line) and calculated (dashed line)\nof R(\u03c9) in optimally doped BISCO [72] at T=100 K. Inset:\nthe reconstructed \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) - solid line. The phonon density\nof states F (\u03c9) - dotted line. From [21].\n\nsome reports [13], [14], [15] it is assumed that \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9)\nof cuprates can be extracted also in the superconducting\nstate by using Eq. (23). However, Eq. (23) holds exclusively in the normal state (at T = 0) since \u03c3(\u03c9) can be\ndescribed by the generalized (extended) Drude formula in\nEq. (12) only in the normal state. Such an approach does\n\n\f15\nnot hold in the superconducting state since the dynamical conductivity depends not only on the electron-boson\nscattering but also on coherence factors and on the momentum and energy dependent order parameter \u2206(k, \u03c9).\nIn such a case it is unjustified to extract \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) from\nEq. (23). Second, if R(\u03c9) (and \u03c3(\u03c9)) in cuprates are due\nto some other bosonic scattering which is pronounced up\nto much higher energies \u03c9c \u226b \u03c9 max\nph , this should be seen\nin the extracted spectral function \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9). Such an\nassumption is made, for instance, in the phenomenological spin-fluctuation approach [7] where it is assumed that\n2\n\u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) \u223c gsf\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9) where Im\u03c7(\u03c9) is extended up to\nthe large energy cutoff \u03c9c \u2248 400 meV . This assumption\nis in conflict with the above theoretical and experimental\nanalysis which shows that solely EPI can describe R(\u03c9)\nvery well and that the contribution from higher energies\n\u03c9 \u226b \u03c9 max\nmust be small and therefore irrelevant for\nph\npairing [21], [22], [70]. The finding of the importance of\nEPI is also confirmed by tunnelling measurements - see\ndiscussion in Subsection D. Despite the experimentally\nestablished facts, that the energy width of the extracted\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) coincides with the phononic range, which favor EPI, some reports appeared recently claiming that\n2\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9) where\nSFI dominates and that \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) \u223c gsf\nR 2\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9) = d k\u03c7(k, \u03c9) [14], [15]. This claim is based on\nreanalyzing of some IR measurements [14], [15] and the\ntransport spectral function \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is extracted in\n[14] by using the maximum entropy method in solving\nthe Fredholm equation. However, in order to exclude\nnegative values in the extracted \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9), which is an\nartefact and due to the chosen method, in [14] it is assumed that \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) has a rather large tail at large\nenergies - up to 400 meV. It turns out that even such an\nassumption in extracting \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) does not reproduce\nthe experimental curve Im\u03c7(\u03c9) [73] in some important\nrespects: (i) the relative heights of the two peaks in the\nextracted spectral function \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) at lower temperatures are opposite to the experimental curve Im\u03c7(\u03c9)\n[73] - see Fig. 1 in [14]. (ii) the strong temperature dependence of the extracted \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) found in [14], [15]\nis in fact not an intrinsic property of the spectral function but it is an artefact due to the high sensitivity of the\nextraction procedure on temperature. As it is already explained before, this is due to the ill-posed problem of solving the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind with\nstrong T -dependent kernel. Third, in fact the extracted\nspectral weight IB (\u03c9) = \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) in [14] has much\nsmaller values at larger frequencies (\u03c9 > 100 meV ) than\nit is the case for the measured Im\u03c7(\u03c9), i.e. (IB (\u03c9 > 100\nmeV )/IB (\u03c9 max )) \u226a Im\u03c7(\u03c9 > 100 meV )/Im\u03c7(\u03c9 max ) see Fig. 1 in [14]. Fourth, the recent magnetic neutron scattering measurements on optimally-doped largevolume crystals Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 [62] (where the absolute value of Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) is measured) are not only\nquestioning the theoretical interpretation of magnetism\nin HTSC cuprates in terms of itinerant magnetism but\nthey also oppose the finding in [14]-[15]. This experiment shows that the local spin susceptibility Im\u03c7(\u03c9) =\n\nP\n\nq Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9) is temperature independent across the superconducting transition Tc = 91 K, i.e there is only\na minimal change in Im\u03c7(\u03c9) between 10 K and 100\nK. This T -independence of Im\u03c7(\u03c9) strongly opposes\nthe (above discussed) results in [13], [14], [15], where the\nfit of optic measurements give strong T -dependence of\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9).\nFifth, the transport coupling constant \u03bbtr extracted in\n[14] is too large, i.e. \u03bbtr > 3 contrary to the previous\nfindings that \u03bbtr < 1.5 \u2212 2 [21], [22], [70]. Since in HTSC\none has \u03bb > \u03bbtr this would probably give \u03bb \u2248 6 what\nis not confirmed by other experiments. Sixth, the interpretation of \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) in LSCO and BISCO solely in\nterms of Im\u03c7(\u03c9) is in contradiction with the magnetic\nneutron scattering in the optimally doped and slightly\nunderdoped YBCO [18]. The latter was discussed in Subsection A, where it is shown that Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) is small in\nthe normal state and its magnitude is even below the experimental noise. This means that if the assumption that\n2\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) \u2248 gsf\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9) were correct then the contribution to Im\u03c7(\u03c9) from the momenta 0 < k \u226a Q would be\ndominant which is very detrimental for d-wave superconductivity.\nFinally, we point out that very similar (to cuprates)\nproperties, of \u03c3(\u03c9), R(\u03c9) (and \u03c1(T ) and electronic Raman spectra) were observed in 3D isotropic metallic oxides La0.5 Sr0.5 CoO3 and Ca0.5 Sr0.5 RuO3 which are nonsuperconducting [74] and in Ba1\u2212x Kx BiO3 which superconducts below Tc \u2243 30 K at x = 0.4. This means that in\nall of these materials the scattering mechanism might be\nof similar origin. Since in these compounds there are no\nsigns of antiferromagnetic fluctuations (which are present\nin cuprates), then EPI plays important role also in other\noxides.\n3. Restricted optical sum-rule\nThe restricted optical sum-rule was studied intensively\nin HTSC cuprates. It shows some peculiarities not\npresent in low-temperature superconductors. It turns out\nthat the restricted spectral weight W (\u03a9c , T ) is strongly\ntemperature dependent in the normal and superconducting state, that was interpreted either to be due to EPI\n[24], [25] or to some non-phononic mechanisms [75]. In\nthe following we demonstrate that the temperature dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ) = W (0) \u2212 \u03b2T 2 in the normal state\ncan be explained in a natural way by the T -dependence\nof the EPI transport relaxation rate \u03b3 ep\ntr (\u03c9, T ) [24], [25].\nSince the problem of the restricted sum-rule has attracted\nmuch interest it will be considered here in some details.\nIn fact, there are two kinds of sum rules related to \u03c3(\u03c9).\nThe first one is the total sum rule which in the normal\nstate reads\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c3N\n1 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\n\n\u03c9 2pl\n\u03c0ne2\n=\n,\n8\n2m\n\n(24)\n\nwhile in the superconducting state it is given by the\nTinkham-Ferrell-Glover (TFG) sum-rule\n\n\f16\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c3 S1 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\n\nc2\n+\n8\u03bb2L\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3 S1 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\n\n+0\n\n\u03c92pl\n.\n8\n\nvertex correction \u03a0(i\u03c9 n ) (at the Matsubara frequency\n\u03c9n = \u03c0T (2n + 1)) is given by [24], [25]\n(25)\n\u03a0(i\u03c9) = 2\n\nHere, n is the total electron density, e is the electron\ncharge, m is the bare electron mass and \u03bbL is the London\npenetration depth. The first (singular) term c2 /8\u03bb2L in\nEq.(25) is due to the superconducting condensate which\ncontributes \u03c3 S1,cond (\u03c9) = (c2 /4\u03bb2L )\u03b4(\u03c9). The total sum\nrule represents the fundamental property of matter - the\nconservation of the electron number. In order to calculate\nit one should use the total Hamiltonian \u0124tot = T\u0302e + \u0124int\nwhere all electrons, electronic bands and their interactions \u0124int (Coulomb, EPI, with impurities, etc.) are accounted for.

In this case the partial sumrule in the normal state reads [76] (for general form of\n\u01ebp )\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c3N\n1,v (\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\n\n\u03c0e2 X hn\u0302v,p iHv\n2V p\nmp\n\n(28)\n\nP\nwhere the number operator n\u0302v,p = \u03c3 \u0109\u2020p\u03c3 \u0109p\u03c3 ; 1/mp =\n\u2202 2 \u01ebp /\u2202p2x is the momentum dependent reciprocal mass\nand V is volume. In practice, measurements are performed up to finite frequency and the integration over\n\u03c9 goes up to some cutoff frequency \u03a9c (of the order of\nthe band plasma frequency). In this case the restricted\nsum-rule has the form\n\nW (\u03a9c , T ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9c\n0\n\n\u0003\n\u03c0\u0002 d\nK + \u03a0(0) \u2212\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3N\n1,v (\u03c9)d\u03c9\n\n\u03a9c\n0\n\nIm\u03a0(\u03c9)\nd\u03c9.\n\u03c9\n\n(29)\n\nwhere K d is the diamagnetic Kernel given by Eq.(30)\nbelow and \u03a0(\u03c9) is the paramagnetic (current-current)\nresponse function.

In the case when the inter-band\ngap Eg is the largest scale in the problem, i.e. when\nWb < \u03a9c < Eg , in this region one has approximately\nIm\u03a0(\u03c9) \u2248 0 and the limit \u03a9c \u2192 \u221e in Eq.(29) is jusR\u03a9\ntified. In that case one has \u03a0(0) \u2248 0 c (Im\u03a0(\u03c9)/\u03c9)d\u03c9\nwhich gives the approximate formula for W (\u03a9c , T )\nW (\u03a9c , T ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9c\n\n0\n\n= e2 \u03c0\n\n\u03c3N\n1,v (\u03c9)d\u03c9 \u2248\n\nX \u2202 2 \u01ebp\n\u2202p2\n\np\n\nnp ,\n\n\u03c0 d\nK\n2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere np = hn\u0302v,p i is the quasi-particle distribution function in the interacting system. Note, that W (\u03a9c , T ) is\ncutoff dependent while K d in Eq.(30) does not depend\non the cutoff energy \u03a9c . So, one should be careful not\nto over-interpret the experimental results in cuprates by\nthis formula. In that respect the best way is to calculate\nW (\u03a9c , T ) by using the exact result in Eq.(29) which apparently depends on \u03a9c . However, Eq.(30) is useful for\nappropriately chosen \u03a9c , since it allows us to obtain semiquantitative results. In most papers related to the restricted sum-rule in HTSC cuprates it was assumed, due\nto simplicity, the tight-binding model with nearest neighbors (n.n.) with the energy \u01ebp = \u22122t(cos px a + cos py a)\nwhich gives 1/mp = \u22122ta2 cos px a. It is straightforward\nto show that in this case Eq.(30) is reduced to a simpler\none\nZ \u03a9c\n\u03c3N\nW (\u03a9c , T ) =\n1,v (\u03c9)d\u03c9\n0\n\n\u2248\n\n\u03c0e2 a2\nh\u2212Tv i,\n2V\n\n(31)\n\nP\nwhere hTv iHv = p \u01ebp hnv iHv is the average kinetic energy of the band electrons, a is the Cu \u2212 Cu lattice distance and V is the volume of the system. In this approximation W (\u03a9c , T ) is a direct measure of the average band\n(kinetic) energy. In the superconducting state the partial\nband sum-rule reads\nZ \u03a9c\nc2\nWs (\u03a9c , T ) = 2 +\n\u03c3 S1,v (\u03c9)d\u03c9\n8\u03bbL\n+0\n=\n\n\u03c0e2 a2\nh\u2212Tv is .\n2V\n\n(32)\n\n\f17\nIn order to introduce the reader to (the complexity of)\nthe problem of the T -dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ), let us consider the electronic system in the normal state and in\nabsence of quasi-particle interaction. In that case one\nhas np = fp (fp is the Fermi distribution function) and\nWn (\u03a9c , T ) increases with the decrease temperature, i.e.\nWn (\u03a9c , T ) = Wn (0) \u2212 \u03b2 b T 2 where \u03b2 b \u223c 1/Wb . To this\nend, let us mention in advance that the experimental\nvalue \u03b2 exp is much larger than \u03b2 b , i.e. \u03b2 exp \u226b \u03b2 b thus\ntelling us that the simple Sommerfeld-like smearing of fp\nby the temperature effects cannot explain quantitatively\nthe T-dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ). We stress that the smearing of fp by temperature lowers the spectral weight compared to that at T = 0 K, i.e. Wn (\u03a9c , T ) < Wn (\u03a9c , 0).\nIn that respect it is not surprising that there is a lowering of Ws (\u03a9c , T ) in the BCS superconducting state,\nWsBCS (\u03a9c , T \u226a Tc ) < Wn (\u03a9c , T \u226a Tc ) since at low\ntemperatures fp is smeared mainly due to the superconducting gap, i.e. fp = [1 \u2212 (\u03be p /Ep )th(Ep /2T )]/2,\nq\nEp = \u03be 2p + \u22062 , \u03be p = \u01ebp \u2212 \u03bc. The maximal decrease of\nWs (\u03a9c , T ) is at T = 0.\nLet us enumerate and discuss the main experimental\nresults for W (\u03a9c , T ) in HTSC cuprates: 1. in the normal\nstate (T > Tc ) of most cuprates, one has Wn (\u03a9c , T ) =\nWn (0) \u2212 \u03b2 ex T 2 with \u03b2 exp \u226b \u03b2 b , i.e. Wn (\u03a9c , T ) is increasing by decreasing T , even at T below T \u2217 - the temperature for the opening of the pseudogap. The increase\nof Wn (\u03a9c , T ) from room temperature down to Tc is no\nmore than 5 %. 2. In the superconducting state (T < Tc )\nof some underdoped and optimally doped Bi-2212 compounds [77], [78] (and underdoped Bi-2212 films [79])\nthere is an effective increase of Ws (\u03a9c , T ) with respect to\nthat in the normal state, i.e. Ws (\u03a9c , T ) > Wn (\u03a9c , T ) for\nT < Tc . This is a non-BCS behavior which is shown in\nFig. 9. Note, that in the tight binding model the effective band (kinetic) energy hTv i is negative (hTv i < 0) and\nin the standard BCS case Eq.(32) gives that Ws (T < T c)\ndecreases due to the increase of hTv i. Therefore the experimental increase of Ws (T < T c) by decreasing T is\ncalled the non-BCS behavior. The latter means a lowering of the kinetic energy hTv i which is frequently interpreted to be due either to strong correlations or to a BoseEinstein condensation (BEC) of the preformed tightly\nbound Cooper pair-bosons, for instance bipolarons [80].\nIt is known that in the latter case the kinetic energy of\nbosons is decreased below the BEC critical temperature\nTc . In [81] it is speculated that the latter case might be\nrealized in in underdoped cuprates.\nHowever, in some optimally doped and in most overdoped cuprates, there is a decrease of Ws (\u03a9c , T ) at\nT < Tc (Ws (\u03a9c , T ) < Wn (\u03a9c , T )) which is the BCS-like\nbehavior [82] as it is seen in Fig. 10\nWe stress that the non-BCS behavior of Ws (\u03a9c , T )\nfor underdoped (and in some optimally doped) systems\nwas obtained by assuming that \u03a9c \u2248 (1 \u2212 1.2) eV .\nHowever, in Ref. [69] these results were questioned\nand the conventional BCS-like behavior was observed\n\nFIG. 9. Measured spectral weight Ws (\u03a9c , T )(\u223c Al+D in\nfigures) for \u03c9 c \u2248 1.25eV in two underdoped Bi2212 (with\nTc = 88 K and Tc = 66 K). From [78].\n\n(Ws (\u03a9c , T ) < Wn (\u03a9c , T )) in the optimally doped YBCO\nand slightly underdoped Bi-2212 by using larger cutoff\nenergy \u03a9c = 1.5 eV . This discussion demonstrates how\nrisky is to make definite conclusions on some fundamental physics based on the parameter (such as the cutoff\nenergy \u03a9c ) dependent analysis. Although the results obtained in [69] looks very trustfully, it is fair to say that\nthe issue of the reduced spectral weight in the superconducting state of cuprates is still unsettled and under dispute. In overdoped Bi-2212 films, the BCS-like\nbehavior Ws (\u03a9c , T ) < Wn (\u03a9c , T ) was observed, while\nin LSCO it was found that Ws (\u03a9c , T ) \u2248 const, i.e.\nWs (\u03a9c , T < Tc ) \u2248 Wn (\u03a9c , Tc ).\nThe first question is - how to explain the strong temperature dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ) in the normal state?\nIn [24], [25] W (T ) is explained solely in the framework\nof the EPI physics where the EPI relaxation \u03b3 ep (T )\nplays the main role in the T -dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ).\nThe main theoretical results of [24], [25] are the following: the calculations of W (T ) based on exact Eq.(30)\ngive that for \u03a9c \u226b \u03a9D (the Debye energy) the difference in spectral weights of the normal and supercon-\n\n\f18\n\nFIG. 11.

It turns out that\nfor \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) shown in Fig. 4, one obtains: (i) \u03b3 ep (T ) \u223c\nT 2 in the temperature interval 100 K < T < 200 K as it\nis seen in Fig. 11 for the T-dependence of W (\u03a9c , T ) [24],\n[25]; (ii) the second term in Eq.(33) is much larger than\nthe last one (the Sommerfeld-like term). For the EPI\ncoupling constant \u03bbep,tr = 1.5 one obtains rather good\n\nagreement between the theory in [24], [25] and experiments [69], [77], [78]. At lower temperatures, \u03b3 ep (T ) deviates from the T 2 behavior and this deviation depends\non the structure of the spectrum in \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9). It is\nseen in Fig. 11 that for a softer Einstein spectrum (with\n\u03a9E = 200 K), W (\u03a9c , T ) lies above the curve with the\nT 2 asymptotic behavior, while the curve with a harder\nphononic spectrum (with \u03a9E = 400 K) lies below it.\nThis result means that different behavior of W (\u03a9c , T ) in\nthe superconducting state of cuprates for different doping might be simply related to different contributions of\nlow and high frequency phonons. We stress that such a\nbehavior of W (\u03a9c , T ) was observed in experiments [69],\n[77], [78]. To summarize, the above analysis demonstrates that the theory based on EPI is able to explain in\na satisfactory way the strange temperature behavior of\nW (\u03a9c , T ) above and below Tc in systems at and near optimal doping and that there is no need to invoke exotic\nscattering mechanisms. In that respect we would like\nto stress that at present we still do not have fully microscopic theory which comprises strong correlations and\nEPI and which is able to predict the complex behavior\nof W (T ) as a function of T , doping etc.\n4. \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) and the in-plane resistivity \u03c1ab (T )\nThe temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity\n\u03c1ab (T ) in cuprates is a direct consequence of the quasi-2D\nmotion of quasi-particles and of the inelastic scattering\nwhich they experience. At present, there is no consensus\non the origin of the linear temperature dependence of the\nin-plane resistivity \u03c1ab (T ) in the normal state. Our intention is not to discuss this problem, but only to demonstrate that the EPI spectral function \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9), which\n\n\f19\n\nFIG. 12. (top) Calculated resistivity \u03c1(T ) for the EPI spectral\nfunction \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) in [83]. (bottom) Measured resistivity in\na(x)- and b(y)-crystal direction of YBCO [84] and calculated\nBloch-Gr\u00fcneisen curve (points) for \u03bbep = 1, [95].\n\nis obtained from tunnelling experiments in cuprates (see\nSubsection D), is able to explain the temperature dependence of \u03c1ab (T ) in optimally doped Y BCO. In the\nBoltzmann theory \u03c1ab (T ) is given by\n\u03c1ab (T ) = \u03c1imp +\n\u03c0\n\u03b3 tr (T ) =\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\n\n4\u03c0\n\u03b3 (T )\n\u03c9 2p tr\n\n\u03c9\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9),\nsinh (\u03c9/2T )\n2\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03c1imp is the impurity scattering. Since \u03c1(T ) =\n1/\u03c3(\u03c9 = 0, T ) and having in mind that the dynamical\nconductivity \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) in Y BCO (at and near the optimal doping) is satisfactory explained by the EPI scattering, then it is to expect that \u03c1ab (T ) is also dominated\nby EPI in some temperature region T > Tc . This is\nindeed confirmed in the optimally doped Y BCO, where\n\u03c1imp is chosen appropriately and the spectral function\n\u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) is taken from the tunnelling experiments in\n[27]. The very good agreement with the experimental results [83] is shown in Fig. 12. We stress that\nin the case of EPI there is always a temperature region where \u03b3 tr (T ) \u223c T for T > \u03b1\u0398D , \u03b1 < 1 depending on the shape of \u03b12tr (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) (for the simple Debye spectrum \u03b1 \u2248 0.2). In the linear regime one has\n\u03c1(T ) \u2243 \u03c1imp + 8\u03c0 2 \u03bbep,tr (kB T /~\u03c92p ) = \u03c1imp + \u03c1\u2032 T .\nThere is an experimental constraint on \u03bbtr , i.e. \u03bbtr \u2248\n0.25\u03c92pl (eV )\u03c1\u2032 (\u03bc\u03a9 cm/K), which imposes a limit on it.\nFor instance, for \u03c9pl \u2248 (2 \u2212 3) eV [74] and \u03c1\u2032 \u2248 0.6 in\n\nthe oriented YBCO films and \u03c1\u2032 \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.4 in single\ncrystals of BSCO, one obtains \u03bbtr \u2248 0.6 \u2212 1.4. In case of\nYBCO single crystals, there is a pronounced anisotropy\nin \u03c1ab (T ) [84] which gives \u03c1\u2032x (T ) = 0.6 \u03bc\u03a9cm/K and\n\u03c1\u2032y (T ) = 0.25 \u03bc\u03a9cm/K. The function \u03bbtr (\u03c9 pl ) is shown\nin Fig.13 where the plasma frequency \u03c9 pl can be calculated by LDA-DFT and also extracted from the width\n(\u223c \u03c9 \u2217pl ) of the Drude peak at small frequencies, where\n\u221a\n\u03c9pl = \u03b5\u221e \u03c9 \u2217pl . We stress that the rather good agreement\nof theoretical and experimental results for \u03c1ab (T ) should\nbe not over-interpreted in the sense that the above rather\nsimple electron-phonon approach can explain the resistivity in HTSC for various doping. In fact this in highly\nunderdoped systems where \u03c1ab (T ) is very different from\nthe behavior in Fig. 12. In this case one should certainly\ntake into account polaronic effects [5], [6], strong correlations, etc. and in these cases the simplified MigdalEliashberg theory is not sufficient. The above analysis on the resistivity in optimally doped system demonstrates only, that if in Eq.(35) one uses the EPI spectral\nfunction \u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) obtained from the tunnelling experiments (and optics) one obtains the correct T -dependence\nof \u03c1a,b (T ) for some optimally doped cuprates, which is an\nadditional evidence for the importance of EPI.\nConcerning the linear (in T ) resistivity we would like\nto point out that there is some evidence that linear resistivity is observed in HTSC cuprates sometimes at temperatures T < 0.2 \u0398D [87], [88]. In that respect, it was\nshown by [89] that in two-dimensional systems with a\nbroad interval of phonon spectra the quasi-linear behavior of \u03c1ab (T ) is realized even at T < 0.2 \u0398D . The quasilinear behavior of the resistivity at T \u226a 0.2 \u0398D has been\nobserved in Bi2 (Sr0.97 Pr0.003 )2 CuO6 [86] inLSCO and 1layer Bi-2201 [87], [88], [90], [91], [92], all systems with\nrather small Tc \u2248 10 K. We would like to emphasize here\nthat some of these observations are contradictory. For example, the results obtained in the group of Vedeneev [91],\n[92] show that some samples demonstrate the quasi-linear\nbehavior of the resistivity up to T = 10 K but some\nothers with approximately the same Tc have the usual\nBloch-Gr\u00fcneisen type behavior characteristic for EPI. In\nthat respect it is very unlikely that the linear resistivity\nup to T = 10 K can be simply explained in the standard\nway by interactions of electrons with some known bosons\neither by phonons or spin-fluctuations (magnons). The\nquestion, why in some cuprates the linear resistivity is\nobserved up to T = 10 K is still a mystery and its explanation is a challenge for all kinds of the electron-boson\nscattering, not only for EPI. In that respect it is interesting to mention that the existence of the forward scattering peak in EPI (with the width qc \u226a kF ), which is due\nto strong correlations, may give rise to the linear behavior of \u03c1(T ) down to very low temperatures T \u223c \u0398D /30\n[3], [93], [94] - see more in Part II, Section VII.D item\n6.. We shall argue in Subsection D that if one interprets\nthe tunnelling experiments in systems near optimal doping [27]-[32] in the framework of the Eliashberg theory\none obtains large EPI coupling constant \u03bbep \u2248 2 \u2212 3.5\n\n\f20\n\nFIG. 13. Transport EPI spectral function coupling constant in\nYBCO as a function of plasma frequency \u03c9 p as derived from\nthe experimental slope of resistivity \u03c1\u2032 (T ). \u03bbx for \u03c1\u2032x (T ) =\n0.6\u03bc\u03a9cm/K and \u03bby for \u03c1\u2032y (T ) = 0.25\u03bc\u03a9cm/K [84].

This means that EPI is\nreduced much more in transport properties than in the\nself-energy, which is due to some reasons that shall be\ndiscussed in Part II. Such a large reduction of \u03bbtr cannot\nbe obtained within the LDA-DFT band structure calculations which means that \u03bbep and \u03bbtr contain renormalization which do not enter in the LDA \u2212 DF T theory.\nIn Part II we shall argue that the strong suppression of\n\u03bbtr may have its origin in strong electronic correlations\n[51], [96] and in the long-range Madelung energy [2], [3].\n4. Femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy\nThe femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy\n(FTROS) has been developed in the last couple of years\nand applied to HTSC cuprates. In this method a femtosecond (1 f s = 10\u221215 sec) laser pump excites in materials electron-hole pairs via interband transitions. These\nhot carriers release their energy via electron-electron\n(with the relaxation time \u03c4 ee ) and electron-phonon scattering reaching states near the Fermi energy within\n10 \u2212 100 f s - see [98]. The typical energy density of\nthe laser pump pulses with the wavelength \u03bb \u2248 810 nm\n(~\u03c9 = 1.5 eV ) was around F \u223c 1\u03bcJ/cm2 (the excitation\nfluence F ) which produces approximately 3 \u00d7 1010 carriers per pulse (by assuming that each photon produces\n~\u03c9/\u2206 carriers, \u2206 is the superconducting gap). By measuring photoinduced changes of the reflectivity in time,\ni.e. \u2206R(t)/R0 , one can extract information on the relaxation dynamics of the low-laying electronic excitations.\nSince \u2206R(t) relax to equilibrium the fit with exponential\nfunctions is used\nh\ni\n\u2206R(t)\n\u2212 t\n\u2212 t\n= f (t) Ae \u03c4 A + Be \u03c4 B + ... ,\n(36)\nR0\nwhere f (t) = H(t)[1 \u2212 exp{\u2212t/\u03c4 ee }] (H(t) is the\n\nHeavyside function) describes the finite rise-time. The\nparameters A, B depends on the fluence F . This\nmethod was used in studying the superconucting phase\nof La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 , with x = 0.1, 0.15 and Tc = 30 K\nand 38 K respectively [26]. In that case one has A 6= 0\nfor T <Tc and A = 0 for T > Tc , while the signal B was\npresent also at T > Tc . It turns out that the signal A\nis related to the quasi-particle recombination across the\nsuperconducting gap \u2206(T ) and has a relaxation time of\nthe order \u03c4 A > 10 ps at T = 4.5 K. At the so called\nthreshold fluence (FT = 4.2 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcJ/cm2 for x = 0.1\nand FT = 5.8 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcJ/cm2 for x = 0.15) the vaporization (destroying) of the superconducting phase occurs,\nwhere the parameter A saturates. This vaporization process takes place at the time scala \u03c4 r \u2248 0.8 ps. The\nexternal fluence is distributed in the sample over the\nexcitation volume which is proportional to the optical\npenetration depth \u03bbop (\u2248 150 nm at \u03bb \u2248 810 nm) of\nthe pump. The energy densities stored in the excitation volume at the vaporization threshold for x = 0.1\nand x = 0.15 are Up = FT /\u03bbop = 2.0 \u00b1 0.8 K/Cu and\n2.6 \u00b1 1.0 K/Cu, respectively. The important fact is that\nUp is much larger than the superconducting condensation energy which is Ucond \u2248 0.12 K/Cu for x = 0.1\nand Ucond \u2248 0.3 K/Cu for x = 0.15, i.e. Up \u226b Ucond .\nThis means that the energy difference Up \u2212Ucond must be\nstored elsewhere on the time scale \u03c4 r . The only present\nreservoir which can absorb the difference in energy are\nthe bosonic baths of phonons and spin fluctuations. The\nenergy required to heat the spin reservoir from T = 4.5\nRT\nK to Tc is Usf = T c Csf (T )dT . The measured specific heat Csf (T ) in La2 CuO4 [26] gives very small value\nUsf \u2248 0.01 K. In the case of the phonon reservoir on\nRT\nobtains Uph = T c Cph (T )dT = 9 K/Cu for x = 0.1 and\n28 K/Cu for x = 0.15, where Cph is the phonon specific heat. Since Usf \u226a Up \u2212 Ucond the spin reservoir\ncannot absorb the rest energy Up \u2212 Ucond . The situation is opposite with phonons since Uph \u226b Up \u2212 Ucond\nand phonon can absorb the rest energy in the excitation\nvolume. The complete vaporization dynamics can be described in the framework of the Rothwarf-Taylor model\nwhich describes approaching of electrons and phonons to\nquasi-equilibrium on the time scale of 1 ps [99]. We shall\nnot go into details but only summarize by quoting the\nconclusion in [99], that only phonon-mediated vaporization is consistent with the experiments, thus ruling out\nspin-mediated quasi-particle recombination and pairing\nin HTSC cuprates. The FTROS method tell us that at\nleast for non-equilibrium processes EPI is more important than SFI. It gives also some opportunities for obtaining the strength of EPI but at present there is no\nreliable analysis.\nIn conclusion, optics and resistivity measurements in\nthe normal state of cuprates give evidence that EPI is\nimportant while the spin fluctuation scattering is weaker\nthan it is believed. However, some important questions\nrelated to the transport properties remain to be answered: (i) what are the values of \u03bbtr and \u03c9 pl ; (ii) what is\n\n\f21\nthe reason that \u03bbtr \u226a \u03bb is realized in cuprates; (iii) what\nis the role of Coulomb scattering in \u03c3(\u03c9) and \u03c1(T ). Later\non we shall argue that ARPES measurements in cuprates\ngive evidence for an appreciable contribution of Coulomb\nscattering at higher frequencies, where \u03b3(\u03c9) \u2248 \u03b3 0 + \u03bbc \u03c9\nfor \u03c9 > \u03c9 ph\nmax with \u03bbc \u223c 1. One should stress, that despite the fact that EPI is suppressed in transport properties it is sufficiently strong in the quasi-particle selfenergy, as it comes out from tunnelling measurements\ndiscussed below.\n\nC.\n\nARPES and the EPI self-energy\n\nThe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) is nowadays one of leading spectroscopy\nmethods in the solid state physics [12]. In some favorable conditions it provides direct information on the\none-electron removal spectrum in a complex many body\nsystem. The method involves shining light (photons)\nwith energies between Ei = 5 \u2212 1000 eV on samples and\nby detecting momentum (k)- and energy(\u03c9)-distribution\nof the outgoing electrons. The resolution of ARPES\nhas been significantly increased in the last decade\nwith the energy resolution of \u2206E \u2248 1 \u2212 2 meV (for\nphoton energies \u223c 20 eV ) and angular resolution of\n\u2206\u03b8 . 0.2\u25e6 . On the other side the ARPES method is\nsurface sensitive technique, since the average escape\ndepth (lesc ) of the outgoing electrons is of the order\nof lesc \u223c 10 \u00c5, depending on the energy of incoming\nphotons. Therefore, very good surfaces are needed in\norder that the results to be representative for bulk\nsamples. The most reliable studies were done on the\nbilayer Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 (Bi \u2212 2212) and its single\nlayer counterpart Bi2 Sr2 CuO6 (Bi2201), since these\nmaterials contain weakly coupled BiO planes with the\nlongest inter-plane separation in the cuprates. This\nresults in a natural cleavage plane making these materials superior to others in ARPES experiments. After a\ndrastic improvement of sample quality in other families\nof HTSC materials, the ARPES technique has became\nan important method in theoretical considerations. The\nARPES can indirectly give information on the momentum and energy dependence of the pairing potential.\nFurthermore, the electronic spectrum of the (above\nmentioned) cuprates is highly quasi-2D which allows\nrather unambiguous determination of the initial state\nmomentum from the measured final state momentum,\nsince the component parallel to the surface is conserved\nin photoemission. In this case, the ARPES probes\n(under some favorable conditions) directly the single\nparticle spectral function A(k, \u03c9). In the following we\ndiscuss mainly those ARPES experiments which give\nevidence for the importance of the EPI in cuprates - see\nmore in [12].\nARPES measures a nonlinear response function of the\nelectron system and it is usually analyzed in the so-called\nthree-step model, where the total photoemission inten-\n\nsity Itot (k, \u03c9) \u2248 I1 * I2 * I3 is the product of three independent terms: (1) I1 - describes optical excitation of\nthe electron in the bulk; (2) I2 - describes the scattering probability of the travelling electrons; (2) I3 - the\ntransmission probability through the surface potential\nbarrier. The central quantity in the three-step model\nis I1 (k, \u03c9) and it turns out that for k = kk it can be\nwritten in the form I1 (k, \u03c9) \u2243 I0 (k, \u03c5)f (\u03c9)A(k, \u03c9) [12]\nwith I0 (k, \u03c5) \u223c| h\u03c8 f | pA |\u03c8 i i |2 and the quasi-particle\nspectral function A(k, \u03c9) = \u2212ImG(k, \u03c9)/\u03c0\n1\nIm\u03a3(k, \u03c9)\n.\n\u03c0 [\u03c9 \u2212 \u03be(k) \u2212 Re\u03a3(k, \u03c9)]2 + Im\u03a32 (k, \u03c9)\n(37)\nHere, h\u03c8 f | p * A |\u03c8 i i is the dipole matrix element which\ndepends on k, polarization and energy Ei of the incoming photons. The knowledge of the matrix element is of\na great importance and its calculation from first principles was done in [100]. f (\u03c9) is the Fermi function,\nG and \u03a3 = Re\u03a3 + iIm\u03a3 are the quasi-particle Green's\nfunction and the self-energy, respectively. We summarize\nand comment here some important ARPES results which\nwere obtained in the last several years and which confirm\nthe existence of the Fermi surface and importance of EPI\nin the quasi-particle scattering [12].\nARPES in the normal state\n(N1) There is well defined Fermi surface in the metallic state of optimally and near optimally doped cuprates\nwith the topology predicted by the LDA-DFT. However,\nthe bands are narrower than LDA-DFT predicts which\npoints to a strong quasi-particle renormalization. (N2)\nThe spectral lines are broad with |Im\u03a3(k, \u03c9) |\u223c \u03c9 (or\n\u223c T for T > \u03c9) which tells us that the quasi-particle\nliquid is a non-canonical Fermi liquid for larger values of\nT, \u03c9. (N3) There is a bilayer band splitting in Bi \u2212 2212\n(at least in the over-doped state) what is also predicted\nby LDA-DFT. In the case when the coherent hopping\nt\u22a5 between two layers in the bilayer dominates, then the\nanti-bonding and bonding bands \u03be a,b\n= \u03be k \u00b1 t\u22a5\nk with\nk\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n2\n2\ntk = [t (cos kx \u2212 cos ky ) + ...] have been observed. It\nis worth to mention that the previous experiments did\nnot show this splitting what was one of the reasons for\nvarious speculations on some exotic electronic scattering\nand non-Fermi liquid scenarios. (N4) In the under-doped\ncuprates and at temperatures Tc < T < T \u2217 there is a dwave like pseudogap \u2206pg (k) \u223c \u2206pg,0 (cos kx \u2212 cos ky ) in\nthe quasi-particle spectrum where \u2206pg,0 increases by lowering doping. We stress that the pseudogap phenomenon\nis not well understood at present and since we are interested in systems near optimal doping where the pseudogap phenomena are absent or much less pronounced we\nshall not discuss this problem here. Its origin can be due\nto a precursor superconductivity or due to a competing\norder, such as spin- or charge-density wave, strong correlations, etc. (N5) The ARPES self-energy gives evidence\nthat EPI interaction is rather strong. The arguments for\nlatter statement are the following: (i) at T > Tc there are\nkinks in the quasi-particle dispersion \u03c9(\u03be k ) in the nodal\nA(k, \u03c9) = \u2212\n\n\f22\n\nFIG. 15.\n(a) Effective real self-energy for the nonsuperconducting La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 , x = 0.03.

(a2 and b2) is E(k) in the superconducting state at 10 K with the shifted kink to 70meV .\n(d) kink positions as a function of \u03c6 in the anti-nodal region.\nFrom Ref.

These kinks exist also above Tc\nwhat excludes the scenario with the magnetic resonance\npeak in Im\u03c7s (Q, \u03c9). Moreover, since the tunnelling and\nmagnetic neutron scattering measurements give small\nSFI coupling constant gsf < 0.2 eV then the kinks can\n\nnot be due to SFI. (iii) The position of the nodal kink\nis practically doping independent which points towards\nphonons as the scattering and pairing boson. (N6) The\nquasi-particles (holes) at and near the nodal-point kN\ncouple practically to a rather broad spectrum of phonons\nsince at least three group of phonons were extracted\nin the bosonic spectral function \u03b12 F (kN , \u03c9) from the\nARPES effective self-energy in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [102] Fig. 15.\nThis result is in a qualitative agreement with numerous tunnelling measurements [27]-[32] which apparently\ndemonstrate that the very broad spectrum of phonons\ncouples with holes without preferring any particular\nphonons - see discussion below. (N7) Recent ARPES\nmeasurements in B2212 [61] show very different slope\nd\u03c9/d\u03be k of the quasi-particle energy \u03c9(\u03be k ) at small |\n\u03be k |\u226a \u03c9 ph and at large energies | \u03be k |\u226b \u03c9 ph - see\nFig. 16. The theoretical analysis [103] of these results\nZ\ngives the total coupling constant \u03bbZ = \u03bbZ\nep + \u03bbc \u2248 3,\nZ\nand for the EPI coupling \u03bbep \u2248 2 while the Coulomb\ncoupling (SFI is a part of it) is \u03bbZ\nc \u2248 1 [103] - see\nFig. 16. (Note, that the upper index Z in the coupling\nconstants means the quasi-particle renormalization in the\nnormal part of the self-energy.) To this end let us mention some confusion which is related to the value of the\nEPI coupling constant extracted from ARPES. Namely,\nin [12], [104], [105] the EPI self-energy was obtained by\nsubtracting the high energy slope of the quasi-particle\nspectrum \u03c9(\u03be k ) at \u03c9 \u223c 0.3 eV . The latter is apparently due to the Coulomb interaction. Although the position of the low-energy kink is not affected by this procedure (if \u03c9 max\nph \u226a \u03c9 c ), this subtraction procedure gives\nin fact an effective EPI self-energy \u03a3ep\nef f (k, \u03c9) and the\n\n\f23\n(as we already argued) most probably of the phononic\norigin [12], [104], [105], while the second kink at higher\nenergy \u03c92 \u2248 \u03c9 c \u2248 350 meV is due to the Coulomb interaction. However, the important results in Ref. [106] is\nthat the slopes of Re\u03a3exp (k, \u03c9) at low (\u03c9 < \u03c9 high\nph ) and\n\nFIG. 16.

We demonZ\nstrate below that the \u03bbep,ef f (k) is smaller than the real\nEPI coupling constant \u03bbZ\nep (k). The total self-energy is\n\u03a3(k, \u03c9) = \u03a3ep (k, \u03c9) + \u03a3c (k, \u03c9) where \u03a3c is the contribution due to the Coulomb interaction. At very low energies \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9 c one has usually \u03a3c (k, \u03c9) = \u2212\u03bbZ\nc (k)\u03c9,\nwhere \u03c9 c (\u223c 1 eV ) is the characteristic Coulomb energies and \u03bbZ\nc is the Coulomb coupling constant. The\nquasi-particle spectrum \u03c9(k) is determined from the condition \u03c9 \u2212 \u03be(k) \u2212 Re[\u03a3ep (k, \u03c9) + \u03a3c (k, \u03c9)] = 0 where\n\u03be(k) is the bare band structure energy.

At higher energies \u03c9 ph < \u03c9 < \u03c9 c the EPI\nep\neffects are suppressed and \u03a3 (k, \u03c9) stops growing, one\nhas Re\u03a3(k, \u03c9) \u2248 Re\u03a3ep (k, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03bbZ\nc (k)\u03c9. The measured\nRe\u03a3exp (k, \u03c9) at T = 10 K near and slightly away from\nthe nodal point in the optimally doped Bi-2212 with\nTc = 91 K [106] is shown in Fig. 16.\nIt is seen that Re\u03a3exp(k, \u03c9) has two kinks - the first\none at low energy \u03c9 1 \u2248 \u03c9 high\n\u2248 50 \u2212 70 meV which is\nph\n\nhigh energies (\u03c9 high\n< \u03c9 < \u03c9c ) are very different. The\nph\nlow-energy and high-energy slope near the nodal point are\nshown in Fig. 16 schematically (thin lines). From Fig. 16\nit is obvious that EPI prevails at low energies \u03c9 < \u03c9high\nph .\nMore precisely digitalization of Re\u03a3exp (k, \u03c9) in the interval \u03c9 high\n< \u03c9 < 0.4 eV gives the Coulomb coupling\nph\nZ\n\u03bbc \u2248 1.1 while the same procedure at 20 meV \u2248 \u03c9 low\nph <\n\u03c9 < \u03c9 high\n\u2248\n50\n\u2212\n70meV\ngives\nthe\ntotal\ncoupling\nconph\nZ\nZ\nZ\nstant (\u03bb2 \u2261)\u03bb = \u03bbep + \u03bbc \u2248 3.2 and the EPI coupling\nZ\nZ\nconstant \u03bbZ\nep (\u2261 \u03bbep,high ) \u2248 2.1 > 2\u03bbep,ef f (k), i.e. the\nEPI coupling is at least twice larger than the effective\nEPI coupling constant obtained in the previous analysis of ARPES results [12], [104], [105]. This estimation\ntells us that at (and near) the nodal point, the EPI interaction dominates in the quasi-particle scattering at\nc\nZ\nlow energies since \u03bbZ\nep (\u2248 2.1) \u2248 2\u03bbz > 2\u03bbsf , while at\nlarge energies (compared to \u03c9ph ), the Coulomb interaction with \u03bbZ\nc \u2248 1.1 dominates. We point out that EPI\nnear the anti-nodal point can be even larger than in the\nnodal point, mostly due to the higher density of states\nnear the anti-nodal point. (N8) Recent ARPES spectra\nin the optimally doped Bi \u2212 2212 near the nodal and\nanti-nodal point [105] show a low energy isotope effect in\nRe\u03a3exp(k, \u03c9), which can be well described in the framework of the Migdal-Eliashberg theory for EPI [107]. At\nhigher energies \u03c9 > \u03c9 ph the obtained in [105] very pronounced isotope effect cannot be explained by the simple\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory [107]. However, there are controversies with the strength of the high-energy isotope\neffect since it was not confirmed in other measurements\n[108], [109] - see the discussion in Section F.2 related to\nthe isotope effects in HTSC cuprates. (N9) ARPES experiments on Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 give strong evidence for the\nformation of small polarons in undoped cuprates which\nare due to phonons and strong EPI, while by doping\nquasi-particles appear and there are no small polarons\n[110]. Namely, in [110] a broad peak around \u22120.8 eV is\nobserved at the top of the band (k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)) with the\ndispersion similar to that predicted by the t \u2212 J model see Fig. 17.\nHowever, the peak in Fig. 17 (left) is of Gaussian shape\nand can be described only by coupling to bosons, i.e. this\npeak is a boson side band - see more in [6] and references therein. The theory based on the t-J model (in the\nantiferromagnetic state of the undoped compound) by\nincluding coupling to several (half-breathing, apical oxygen, low-lying) phonons, which is given in [111], explains\nsuccessfully this broad peak of the boson side band by\nthe formation of small polarons due to the EPI coupling\n(\u03bbep \u2248 1.2). Note that this value of \u03bbep is for the polaron at the bottom of the band while in the case where\n\n\f24\n\nFIG. 17.\n(left-b) The ARPES spectrum of undoped\nCa2 CuO2 Cl2 at k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).

Horizontal lines are the chemical potentials\nfor a large number of samples. From [110].\n\nthe Fermi surface exists (in doped systems) this coupling\nis even larger due to the larger density of states at the\nFermi surface [111]. In [111] it was stressed that even\nwhen the electron-magnon interaction is stronger than\nEPI the polarons in the undoped systems are formed due\nto EPI. The latter mechanism involves excitation of many\nphonons at the lattice site (where the hole is seating),\nwhile it is possible to excite only one magnon at the\ngiven site. (N10) Recent soft x-ray ARPES measurements on the electron doped HTSC N d1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4\n[112], and Sm(2\u2212x) Cex CuO4 (x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.18),\nN d1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 , Eu1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 [113] show kink\nat energies 50 \u2212 70 meV in the quasi-particle dispersion\nrelation along both nodal and antinodal directions as it\nis shown in Fig. 18.\nIt is seen from this figure that the effective EPI coupling constant \u03bbep,ef f (< \u03bbep ) is isotropic and \u03bbep,ef f \u2248\n0.8 \u2212 1. It seems that the kink in the electron-doped\ncuprates is due solely to EPI and in that respect the situation is similar to the one in the hole-doped cuprates.\nARPES results in the superconducting state\n(S1) There is an anisotropic superconducting gap in\nmost HTSC compounds [12], which is predominately dwave like, i.e. \u2206(k) \u2248 \u22060 (cos kx \u2212 cos ky ) with 2\u22060 /Tc \u2248\n5 \u2212 6. (S2) The particle-hole coherence in the superconducting state which is expected for the BCS-like theory of superconductivity has been observed first in [114]\nand confirmed with better resolution in [115], where the\nparticle-hole mixing is clearly seen in the electron and\nhole quasi-particle dispersion.

This is very important result since it\nproves that the pairing in HTSC cuprates is of the BCS\ntype and not exotic one as was speculated long time after the discovery of HTSC cuprates. (S3) The kink at\n(60 \u2212 70) meV in the quasi-particle energy around the\nnodal point is not shifted (in energy) while the antin(40)\nodal kink at \u03c9ph \u223c 40 meV is shifted (in energy) in\nthe superconducting state by \u22060 (= (25 \u2212 30)meV ), i.e.\n(40)\n(40)\n\u03c9ph \u2192 \u03c9ph + \u22060 = (65 \u2212 70)meV [12]. To remind the\nreader, in the standard Eliashberg theory the kink in the\nnormal state at \u03c9 = \u03c9 ph should be shifted in the superconducting state to \u03c9ph + \u22060 at all points at the Fermi\nsurface. This puzzling result (that the quasi-particle energy around the nodal point is not shifted in the super-\n\n\f25\nconducting state) might be a smoking gun result since\nit makes an additional constraint on the quasi-particle\ninteraction in cuprates. Until now there is only one plausible explanation [116] of this non-shift puzzle which is\nbased on an assumption of the forward scattering peak\n(FSP) in EPI - see more in Part II. The FSP in EPI means\nthat electrons scatter into a narrow region (q < qc \u226a kF )\naround the initial point in the k-space, so that at the most\npart of the Fermi surface there is practically no mixing of\nstates with different signs of the order parameter \u2206(k).\nIn that case the EPI bosonic spectral function (which is\ndefined in Appendix A) \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03a9) \u2248 \u03b12 F (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 , \u03a9)\n(\u03c6 is the angle on the Fermi surface) has a pronounced\nforward scattering peak (at \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 = 0) due\nto strong correlations - see Part II. Its width \u03b4\u03c6c is\nnarrow, i.e \u03b4\u03c6c \u226a 2\u03c0 and the angle integration goes\nover the region \u03b4\u03c6c around the point \u03c6. In that case\nthe kink is shifted (approximately) by the local gap\n\u2206(\u03c6) = \u2206max cos 2\u03c6 - for more details see [116]. As the\nconsequence, the anti-nodal kink is shifted by the maximal gap, i.e. |\u2206(\u03c6AN \u2248 \u03c0/2)| = \u2206max while the nodal\ngap is practically unshifted since |\u2206(\u03c6AN \u2248 \u03c0/4)| \u2248 0.\n(S4) The recent ARPES spectra [117] on an undoped\nsingle crystalline 4-layered cuprate with apical fluorine\n(F), Ba2 Ca3 Cu4 O8 F2 (F0234) give rather convincing evidence against the SFI mechanism of pairing - see Fig. 19.\nFirst, F0234 is not a Mott insulator - as expected from\nvalence charge counting which puts Cu valence as 2+ ,\nbut it is a superconductor with Tc = 60 K. Moreover,\nthe ARPES data [117] reveal at least two metallic Fermisurface sheets with corresponding volumes equally below\nand above half-filling - see Fig. 20.\nSecond, one of the Fermi-surfaces is due to the electronlike (N ) band (with 20 \u00b1 6% electron-doping) and the\nother one due to the hole-like (P ) band (with 20 \u00b1 8\n% hole-doping) and their splitting along the nodal direction is significant and cannot be explained by the\nLDA-DFT calculations [118]. This electron and hole selfdoping of inner and outer layers is in an appreciable contrast to other multilayered cuprates where there is only\nhole self-doping. For instance, in HgBa2 Can Cun+1 O2n+2\n(n = 2, 3) and (Cu,C)Ba2 Can Cun+1 O3n+2 (n = 2, 3, 4),\nthe inner CuO2 layers are less hole-doped than outer layers. It turns out, unexpectedly, that the superconducting\ngap on the N -band Fermi-surface is significantly larger\nthan on the P -one, where in Ba2 Ca3 Cu4 O8 F2 the ratio is anomalous (\u2206N /\u2206P ) \u2248 2 and \u2206N is an order\nof magnitude larger than in the electron-doped cuprate\nN d2\u2212x Cex CuO4 . Third, the N -band Fermi-surface is\nrather far from the antinodal point at (\u03c0, 0). This is very\nimportant result which means that the antiferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations with the AF wave-vector Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0), as\nwell as the van Hove singularity, are not dominant in the\npairing in the N -band. To remind the reader, the SFI\nscenario assumes that the pairing is due to spin fluctuations with the wave-vector Q (and near it) which connects two anti-nodal points which are near the van Hove\nsingularity at the hole-surface (at (\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u03c0)) giv-\n\nFIG. 19. Crystal structure of Ba2 Ca3 Cu4 O8 (O\u03b4 F1\u2212\u03b4 )2 .\nThere are four CuO2 layers in a unit cell with the outer having\napical F atoms. CRL - charge reservoir layer; SCL/OP - superconducting layer/outer plane; SCL/IP - superconducting\nlayer/inner plane. From [117].\n\ning rise to large density of states. This is apparently\nnot the case for the N -band Fermi-surface - see Fig. 20.\nThe ARPES data give further that there is a kink at\n\u223c 85 meV in the quasi-particle dispersion of both bands,\nwhile the kink in the N -band is stronger than that in the\nP -band. This result, together with the anomalous ratio\n(\u2206N /\u2206P ) \u2248 2, strongly disfavors SFI as a pairing mechanism. (S5) Despite the presence of significant elastic\nquasi-particle scattering in a number of samples of optimally doped Bi-2212, there are dramatic sharpening of\nthe spectral function near the anti-nodal point (\u03c0, 0) at\nT < Tc (in the superconducting state) [119]. This effect\ncan be explained by assuming that the small q-scattering\n(the forward scattering peak) dominates in the elastic\nimpurity scattering as it is pointed in [51], [96], [120],\n\n\f26\nD.\n\nFIG. 20. (a) Fermi surface (FS) contours from two samples\nof F0234. N - electron-like; P - hole-like. Bold arrow is (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nscattering vector. Angle \u03b8 defines the horizontal axis in (b).\n(b) Leading gap edge along k-space angle from the two FS\ncontours. From [117].\n\n[121]. As a result, one finds that the impurity scattering rate in the superconducting state is almost zero, i.e.\n\u03b3 imp (k, \u03c9) = \u03b3 n (k, \u03c9) + \u03b3 a (k, \u03c9) \u2248 0 for | \u03c9 |< \u22060 for\nany kind of pairing (s- p- d-wave etc.) since the normal\n(\u03b3 n ) and the anomalous (\u03b3 a ) scattering rates compensate each other. This collapse of the elastic scattering\nrate is elaborated in details in [119] and it is a consequence of the Anderson-like theorem for unconventional\nsuperconductors which is due to the dominance of the\nsmall q-scattering [51], [96], [120]-[121]. In such a case\nd-wave pairing is weakly unaffected by impurities and\nthere is small reduction in Tc [121], [122]. The physics\nbehind this result is rather simple. The small q-scattering\n(usually called forward scattering) means that electrons\nscatter into a small region in the k-space, so that at the\nmost part of the Fermi surface there is no mixing of states\nwith different signs of the order parameter \u2206(k). In such\na way the detrimental effect of impurities on d-wave pairing is significantly reduced. This result points to the importance of strong correlations in the renormalization of\nthe impurity scattering too - see discussion in Part II.\nIn conclusion, in order to explain ARPES results in\ncuprates it is necessary to take into account: (1) the\nelectron-phonon interaction (EPI) since it dominates in\nthe quasi-particle scattering in the energy region important for pairing; (2) effects of elastic nonmagnetic impurities with the forward scattering peak (FSP) due to\nstrong correlations; (3) the Coulomb interaction which\ndominates at higher energies \u03c9 > \u03c9ph . In this respect,\nthe presence of ARPES kinks and the knee-like shape of\nthe T-dependence of the spectral width are important\nconstraints on the scattering and pairing mechanism in\nHTSC cuprates.\n\nTunnelling spectroscopy and spectral function\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9)\n\nBy measuring current-voltage I \u2212 V characteristics\nin N IS (normal metal-insulator-superconductor) tunnelling junctions with large tunnelling barrier one obtains from tunnelling conductance GN S (V ) = dI/dV the\nso called tunnelling density of states in superconductors\nNT (\u03c9). Moreover, by measuring of GN S (V ) at voltages\neV > \u2206 it is possible to determine the Eliashberg spectral\nfunction \u03b12 F (\u03c9) and finally to confirm the phonon mechanism of pairing in LT SC materials. Four tunnelling\ntechniques were used in the study of HT SC cuprates: (1)\nvacuum tunnelling by using the ST M technique - scanning tunnelling microscope; (2) point-contact tunnelling;\n(3) break-junction tunnelling; (4) planar-junction tunnelling. Each of these techniques has some advantages\nalthough in principle the most potential one is the STM\ntechnique since it measures superconducting properties\nlocally [123]. Since tunnelling measurements probe a\nsurface region of the order of superconducting coherence\nlength \u03be 0 , then this kind of measurements in HT SC materials with small coherence length \u03be 0 (\u03be ab \u223c 20 \u00c5 in the\na \u2212 b plane and \u03be c \u223c 1 \u2212 3 \u00c5 along the c \u2212 axis) depends strongly on the surface quality and sample preparation. Nowadays, many of the material problems in\nHT SC cuprates are understood and as a result consistent picture of tunnelling features is starting to emerge.\nFrom tunnelling experiments one obtains the (energy\ndependent) gap function \u2206(\u03c9) in the superconducting\nstate. Since we have already discussed this problem in\n[3], we will only briefly mention some important result,\nthat in most cases GN S (V ) has V -shape in all families of\nHTSC hole and electron doped cuprates. The V -shape\nis characteristic for d \u2212 wave pairing with gapless spectrum, which is also confirmed in the interference experiments on hole and electron doped cuprates [48]. Some\nexperiments give an U -shape of GN S (V ) which resembles\ns-wave pairing. This controversy is explained to be the\nproperty of the tunnelling matrix element which filters\nout states with the maximal gap.\nHere we are interested in the bosonic spectral function\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9) of HTSC cuprates near optimal doping which\ncan be extracted by using tunnelling spectroscopy. We\ninform the reader in advance, that the shape and the\nenergy width of \u03b12 F (\u03c9), which are extracted from the\nsecond derivative d2 I/dV 2 at voltages above the superconducting gap, in most HTSC cuprates resembles the\nphonon density of states Fph (\u03c9). This result is strong\nevidence for the importance of EP I in the pairing potential of HT SC cuprates. For instance, plenty of breakjunctions made from Bi \u2212 2212 single crystals [27] show\nthat the peaks (and shoulders) in \u2212d2 I/dV 2 (or dipsnegative peaks in d2 I/dV 2 ) coincide with the peaks (and\nshoulders) in the phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9) measured by neutron scattering - see Fig. 21.\nThe tunnelling spectra in Bi-2212 break junctions [27],\nwhich are shown in Fig. 21, indicates that the spectral\n\n\f27\n\nFIG. 22.

The\nstructure of dips (minima) in d2 I/dV 2 can be compared with\nthe phonon density of states F (\u03c9); (b) the spectral functions\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9) in various magnetic fields. From [27].\n\nfunction \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is independent of magnetic field, which\nis in contradiction with the theoretical prediction based\non the SFI pairing mechanism where this function should\nbe sensitive to magnetic field. The reported broadening\nof the peaks in \u03b12 F (\u03c9) are partly due to the gapless spectrum of d \u2212 wave pairing in HT SC cuprates. Additionally, the tunnelling density of states NT (\u03c9) at very low\nT and for \u03c9 > \u2206 show a pronounced gap structure. It\n \u0304 c = 6.2 \u2212 6.5, where Tc = 74 \u2212 85 K\nwas found that 2\u2206/T\n \u0304\nand \u2206 is some average value of the gap. In order to ob-\n\ntain \u03b12 F (\u03c9) the inverse procedure was used by assuming\ns \u2212 wave superconductivity and the effective Coulomb\nparameter \u03bc\u2217 \u2248 0.1 [27]. The obtained \u03b12 F (\u03c9) gives\nlarge EP I coupling constant \u03bbep \u2248 2.3. Although this\nanalysis [27] was done in terms of s \u2212 wave pairing, it\nmimics qualitatively the case of d \u2212 wave pairing, since\none expects that d \u2212 wave pairing does not change significantly the global structure of d2 I/dV 2 at eV > \u2206 albeit\nintroducing a broadening in it - see the physical meaning\nin Appendix A. We point out that the results obtained\nin [27] were reproducible on more than 30 junctions. In\nthat respect very important results on slightly overdoped\nBi\u22122212\u2212GaAs and on Bi\u22122212\u2212Au planar tunnelling\njunctions are obtained in [28] - see Fig. 22.\nThese results show very similar features to those obtained in [27] on break-junctions. It is worth mentioning\nthat several groups [29], [30], [31] have obtained similar results for the shape of the spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9)\nfrom the I \u2212V measurements on various HT SC cuprates\n- see the comparison in Fig. 23. These facts leave no\nmuch doubts about the importance of the EP I in pairing mechanism of HT SC cuprates.\nIn that respect, tunnelling measurements on slightly\n\n\f28\n\nFIG. 23. The spectral functions \u03b12 F (\u03c9) from measurements\nof various groups: Vedeneev et al. [27], Gonnelli et al.[31],\nMiyakawa et al. [29], Shimada et al. [28].

The Eliashberg spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) of\nthis compound was extracted from the measurements\nof d2 I/dV 2 and by solving the inverse problem - see\nAppendix A. The extracted \u03b12 F (\u03c9) has several peaks\nin broad energy region up to 80 meV as it is seen in\nFigs. 22-23, which coincide rather well with the peaks in\nthe phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9) - more precisely the\ngeneralized phonon density of states GP DS(\u03c9) defined\nin Appendix A. In [32] numerous peaks, from P 1 \u2212 P 13,\nin \u03b12 F (\u03c9) are discerned as shown in Fig. 24, which correspond to various groups of phonon modes - laying in (and\naround) these peaks. Moreover, in [28], [32] the coupling\nconstants for these modes are extracted as well as their\ncontribution (\u2206Tc ) to Tc as it is seen in Fig. 25. Note,\nthat due to the nonlinearity of the problem the sum of\n\u2206Tc is not equal to Tc .\nThe next remarkable result is that the extracted REP I coupling constant\nis very large, i.e.\nP\n\u03bbep (= 2 d\u03c9\u03b12 F (\u03c9)/\u03c9) =\ni \u03bbi \u2248 3.5 - see Fig. 25.\nIt is obvious from Figs. (24-25) that almost all phonon\nmodes contribute to \u03bbep and Tc , which means that on\nthe average each particular phonon mode is not too\nstrongly coupled to electrons since \u03bbi < 1.3, thus keeping\n\nFIG. 24.

From [28], [32].\n\nthe lattice stable.\n\nFor a better understanding of the the EPI coupling in\nthese systems we show in Fig. 26 the total and partial\ndensity of phononic states. Let us discuss the content of\nthe Table in Fig. 25 in more details where it is shown the\nstrength of the EPI coupling and the relative contribution\nof different phononic modes to Tc . In Fig. 25 it is seen\nthat lower frequency modes from P 1\u2212P 3, corresponding\nto Cu, Sr and Ca vibrations, are rather strongly coupled\nto electrons (with \u03bb\u03ba \u223c 1) which give appreciable contributions to Tc . It is also seen in Fig. 25 that the coupling\nconstants \u03bbi of the high-energy phonons (P 9 \u2212 P 13 with\n\u03c9 \u2265 70 meV ) have \u03bbi \u226a 1 and give moderate contribution to Tc - around 10 %. These results give solid\nevidence for the importance of the low-energy modes related to the change of the Madelung energy in the ionicmetallic structure of HTSC cuprates - the idea advocated\nin [2], [3] and discussed in Part II. If confirmed in other\nHTSC families, these results are in favor of the moderate oxygen isotope effect in cuprates near the optimal\ndoping since the oxygen modes are higher energy modes\nand gives smaller contribution to Tc . We stress that each\npeak P 1 \u2212 P 13 in \u03b12 F (\u03c9) corresponds to many modes.\nIn order to obtain information on the structure of vibrations which are strongly involved in pairing, we show in\n\n\f29\n\nFIG. 25. Table I - Phonon frequency \u03c9, EPI coupling constant\n\u03bbi of the peaks P 1 \u2212 P 13 and contribution \u2206Tc to Tc of each\npeak in \u03b12 F (\u03c9)-shown in Fig.24, obtained from the tunnelling\nconductance of Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 . \u2206Tc is the decrease in Tc\nwhen the peak in \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is eliminated.

It is seen in Fig. 27 that the\nlow-frequency phonons P 1 \u2212 P 2 are dominated by Cu,\nSr, Ca vibrations.\nFurther, based on the Table in Fig. 25 one can conclude\nthat the P 3 modes are stronger coupled to electrons than\nP 4 ones, although the density of state for the P 4 modes is\nlarger. The reason for such an anomalous behavior might\nbe due to symmetries of the corresponding phonons as it\nis seen in Fig. 28. Namely, to the P 3 peak contribute\naxial vibrations of O(1) in the Cu2 plane which are odd\nunder inversion, while in the P 4 peak these modes are\neven. The in-plane modes of Ca and O(1) are present in\nP 3 which are in-phase and out-of-phase modes, while in\nP 4 they are all out-of-phase modes. For more information on other modes P 5 \u2212 P 13 see [32]. We stress that\nthe Eliashberg equations based on the extracted \u03b12 F (\u03c9)\nof the slightly overdoped Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 with the ratio (2\u2206/Tc ) \u2248 6.5 describe rather well numerous optical,\ntransport and thermodynamic properties [32]. However,\nin underdoped systems with (2\u2206/Tc) \u2248 10, where the\npseudogap phenomena are pronounced, there are serious disagreements between experiments and the MigdalEliashberg theory [32]. We would like to stress that the\ncontribution of the high frequency modes (mostly the\noxygen modes) to \u03b12 F (\u03c9) may be underestimated in tun-\n\nFIG. 26.

Namely, the tunnelling current probes a superconductor to a depth of order of the\nquasi-particle mean-free path l(\u03c9) = vF \u03b3 \u22121 (\u03c9). Since\n\u03b3 \u22121 (\u03c9) decreases with increasing \u03c9 the mean free path\ncan be rather small and the effects of the high energy\nphonons are sensitive to the surface contamination.\nSimilar conclusion regarding the structure of the EP I\nspectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) in HT SC cuprates comes out\nfrom tunnelling measurements on Andreev junctions\n(Z \u226a 1 - low barrier) and Giaver junctions (Z \u226b 1 high barrier) in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 and Y BCO compounds\n[125], where the extracted \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is in good accordance\nwith the phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9) - see Fig. 29.\nNote, that the BTK parameter Z is related to the\ntransmission and reflection coefficients for the normal\nmetal (1 + Z 2 )\u22121 and Z 2 (1 + Z 2 )\u22121 respectively.\nAlthough most of the peaks in \u03b12 F (\u03c9) of HT SC\ncuprates coincide with the peaks in the phonon density of states it is legitimate to put the question - can\nthe magnetic resonance in the superconducting state give\nsignificant contribution to \u03b12 F (\u03c9)? In that respect the\ninelastic magnetic neutron scattering measurements of\nthe magnetic resonance as a function of doping [126]\ngive that the resonance energy Er scales with Tc , i.e.\nEr = (5 \u2212 6)Tc as shown in Fig.30. This means that\nif one of the peaks in \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is due to the magnetic\nresonance at \u03c9 = Er , then it should shift strongly with\n\n\f30\n\nFIG. 27.

To this end, recent tunnelling experiments on Bi-2212 [33] show clear doping independence\nof \u03b12 F (\u03c9) as it is seen in Fig. 31. This remarkable\nresult is an additional and strong evidence in favor of\nEPI and against the SFI mechanism of pairing in HTSC\ncuprates which is based on the magnetic resonance peak\nin the superconducting state. In that respect the analysis\nin [127] of tunneling spectra of electron-doped cuprates\nPr0.88 Ce0.12 CuO4 with Tc = 24 K shows the existence\nof the bosonic mode at \u03c9 B = 16 meV which is significantly larger than the magnetic-resonance mode with\n\u03c9 r = (10 \u2212 11) meV . This result excludes the magnetic-\n\nresonance mode as an important factor which modifies\nsuperconductivity.\nThe presence of pronounced phononic structures (and\nthe importance of EPI) in the I(V ) characteristics was\nquite recently demonstrated by the tunnelling measurements on the very good La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4 films prepared\nby the molecular beam epitaxy on the [001]-symmetric\nSrT iO3 bi-crystal substrates [34]. They give unique evidence for eleven peaks in the (negative) second derivative,\ni.e. \u2212d2 I/dV 2 . Furthermore, these peaks coincides with\nthe peaks in the intensities of the phonon Raman scattering data measured at 30 K in single crystals of LSCO\nwith 20 % of Sr [35].

However, recent\nST M experiments on Bi \u2212 2212 [39] give information\non possible nature of the bosonic mode which couples\nwith electrons. In [39] the local conductance dI/dV (r, E)\nis measured where it is found that d2 I/dV 2 (r, E) has\npeak at E(r) = \u2206(r) +\u03a9(r) where dI/dV (r, E) has the\nmaximal slope - see Fig. 33(a).\nIt turns out that the corresponding average phonon\n\u22121/2\nenergy \u03a9\u0304 depends on the oxygen mass, i.e. \u03a9\u0304 \u223c MO ,\nwith \u03a9\u030416 = 52 meV and \u03a9\u030418 \u2248 48 meV - as it is seen\nin Fig. 33(b). This result is interpreted in [39] as an evidence that oxygen phonons are strongly involved in the\nquasi-particle scattering. A possible explanation is put\nforward in [39] by assuming that this isotope effect is due\n\nFIG. 31.

This important result means that the\nhigh Tc is not attributable to a particular phonon mode\nin the EP I mechanism but all phonon modes contribute\nto \u03bbep . Having in mind that the phonon spectrum in\nHT SC cuprates is very broad (up to 80 meV ), then the\nlarge EP I constant (\u03bbep & 2) obtained in tunnelling experiments is not surprising at all. Note, that similar conclusion holds for some other oxide superconductors such\nas Ba9.6 K0.4 BiO3 with Tc = 30 K where the peaks in\nthe bosonic spectral function /extracted from tunnelling\nmeasurements) coincide with the peaks in the phononic\ndensity of states [130], [131]).\n\nE.\nFIG. 32.

However, this result requires a reanalysis since the energy of the bosonic mode in fact coincides\nwith the dip and not with the peak of d2 I/dV 2 (r, E) - as\nreported in [39].\nThe important message of most tunnelling experiments\nin HT SC cuprates near and at the optimal doping is\nthat there is strong evidence for the importance of EP I\nin the quasi-particle scattering and that no particular\n\nPhonon spectra and EPI\n\nAlthough experiments related to phonon spectra and\ntheir renormalization by EP I, such as inelastic neutron,\ninelastic x-ray and Raman scattering, do not give the\nspectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) they nevertheless can give useful, but indirect, information on the strength of EPI for\nsome particular phonons. We stress in advance that the\ninterpretation of experimental results in HTSC cuprates\nby the theory of EPI for weakly correlated electrons is\nrisky since in strongly correlated systems, such as HTSC\ncuprates, the phonon renormalization due to EPI is different than in weakly correlated metals [132]. Since these\nquestions are reviewed in [132] we shall briefly enumerate the main points: (1 ) in strongly correlated systems\nthe EPI coupling for a number of phononic modes can\nbe significantly larger than the LDA-DFT and HartreeFock methods predict. This is due to many-body effects\nnot contained in LDA-DFT [132], [133]. The lack of the\nLDA-DFT calculations in obtaining phonon line-widths\nis clearly demonstrated, for instance in experiments on\nL2\u2212x Srx CuO4 - see review [134] and References therein,\nwhere the bond-stretching phonons at q = (0.3, 0, 0)\nare softer and much broader than the LDA-DFT calculations predict. (Note, the wave vector q is in units\n(2\u03c0/a, 2\u03c0/b, 2\u03c0/c) - for instance in these units (\u03c0, \u03c0) corresponds to (0.5, 0.5).) (2 ) The calculation of phonon\nspectra is in principle very difficult problem since besides the complexity of structural properties in a given\nmaterial one should take into account appropriately the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction of electrons as well as\nstrong short-range repulsion. Our intention is not to discuss this complexity here - for that see for instance in\n[44], but we only stress some important points which will\nhelp to understand problems with which is confronted\nthe theory of phonons in cuprates.\nThe phonon Green's function D(q, \u03c9) depends on\nthe phonon self-energy \u03a0(q, \u03c9) which takes into account all the enumerated properties (note D\u22121 (q, \u03c9) =\nD0\u22121 (q, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03a0(q, \u03c9)). In cases when the EPI coupling\nconstant g(k, k\u2032 ) is a function on the transfer momentum\nq = k \u2212 k\u2032 only, then \u03a0(q) (q = (q, i\u03c9 n )) depends on the\n\n\f33\nquasi-particle charge susceptibility \u03c7c (q) = P (q)/\u03b5e (q)\n2\n\n\u03a0(q) = |gq | \u03c7c (q),\n\n(40)\n\nand P (q) is the irreducible electronic polarization given\nby\nX\nP (q) = \u2212\nG(p + q)\u0393c (p, q)G(p).\n(41)\np\n\nThe screening due to the long-range Coulomb interaction is contained in the electronic dielectric function\n\u03b5e (q) while the\"screening\" due to (strong) correlations\nis described by the charge vertex function \u0393c (p, q). Due\nto complexity of the physics of strong correlations the\nphonon dynamics was studied in the t \u2212 J model but\nwithout the long-range Coulomb interaction [132], [133],\n[135], in which case one has \u03b5e = 1 and \u03c7c (q) = P (q).\nHowever, in studying the phonon spectra in cuprates it\nis expected that this deficiency is partly compensated by\nchoosing the bare phonon frequency \u03c9 0 (q) (contained in\nD0\u22121 (q, \u03c9)) to correspond to undoped compounds [132],\n[135]. It is a matter of future investigations to incorporate all relevant interactions in order to obtain a fully\nmicroscopic and reliable theory of phonons in cuprates.\nAdditionally, the electron-phonon interaction (with the\nbare coupling constant gq ) is dominated by the change\nof the energy of the Zhang-Rice singlet - see more Part II\nSection VII, and in that Eq.(40) for \u03a0(q) is adequate one\n[3], [132], [133]. Since the charge fluctuations in HTSC\ncuprates are strongly suppressed (no doubly occupancy\nof the Cu 3d9 state) due to strong correlations and since\nthe suppressed value of \u03c7c (q) can not be obtained by the\nband-structure calculations this means that LDA-DFT\nunderestimates the EPI coupling constant significantly.\nIn the following we discuss this important result briefly.\n1.\n\nInelastic neutron and x-ray scattering - phonon\nsoftening and width due to EPI\n\nThe softening and broadening of numerous phonon\nmodes has been observed in the normal state of cuprates\ngiving evidence for pronounced EPI effects and for inadequacy of the LDA-DFT calculations in treating strong\ncorrelations and suppression of the charge susceptibility\n[3], [6], [132], [135]. There are several relevant reviews\non this subject [6] , [134], [132], [136] and here we discuss briefly two important examples which demonstrate\nthe inefficiency of the LDA-DFT band structure calculations to treat quantitatively EPI in HTSC cuprates.\nFor instance, the Cu-O bond-stretching phonon mode\nshows a substantial softening at qhb = (0.3, 0, 0) by doping of La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4 and Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 [134], [136] called the half-breathing phonon, and a large broadening\nby 5 meV at 15 % doping [140] as it is seen in Fig. 34.\nWhile the softening can be partly described by the LDADFT method [137], the latter theory predicts an order\nof magnitude smaller broadening than the experimental\n\nFIG. 34. Comparison of DFT calculations with experimental results of inelastic x-ray scattering:(a) phonon energies\nin La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4 and (b) in Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 ; (c) phonon\nline widths in La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4 . DFT calculations [16] gives\nmuch smaller width than experiments [140]. From [139].\n\none. This failure of LDA-DFT is due to incorrect treatment of the ffects of strong correlations on the charge\nsusceptibility \u03c7c (q) and due to absence of many body\neffects which can increase the coupling constant gq - see\nmore in Part II. The neutron scattering measurements in\nLa1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4 give evidence for large (30 %) softenZ\ning of the OZ\nwith \u039b1 symmetry with the energy \u03c9 \u2248 60\nmeV , which is theoretically predicted in [138], and for\nthe large line-width about 17 meV which also suggests\nstrong EPI. These apex modes are favorable for d-wave\npairing since their coupling constants are peaked at small\nmomentum q [6]. Having in mind the above results, there\nis not surprising at all that the recent calculations of the\nEPI coupling constant \u03bbep in the framework of LDA-DFT\ngive very small EPI coupling constant \u03bbep \u2248 0.3 [16], [17].\nThe critical analysis of the LDA-DFT results in HTSC\ncuprates is done in [3] and recently additionally argued\nin [6], [139] by their disagreement with inelastic neutron\nand x-ray scattering measurements - as it is shown in\nFig. 34.\n\n\f34\nIn Part II we shall discuss some theoretical approaches\nrelated to EPI in strongly correlated systems but we\nshall not study the phonon renormalization. The latter problem was studied more detailed and thoroughly in\nthe review article [6], [134]. Here, we point out only\nthree important results. First, there is an appreciable difference in the phonon renormalization in strongly\nand weakly correlated systems. Namely, the change of\nphonon frequencies in the presence of conduction electrons is proportional to the squared coupling constant\n2\n|gq | and charge susceptibility \u03c7c , i.e. \u03b4\u03c9(q) \u223c |gq | Re\u03c7c ,\n2\nwhile the line width is given by \u0393\u03c9(q) \u223c |gq | |Im\u03c7c |. All\nthese quantities can be calculated in LDA-DFT and as we\ndiscussed above where for some modes one obtains that\n(exp)\n(LDA)\n\u0393\u03c9(q) \u226a \u0393\u03c9(q) . However, it turns out that in strongly\ncorrelated systems doped by holes (with the concentration \u03b4 \u226a 1) the charge fluctuations are suppressed in\nwhich case the following sum-rule holds [6], [135]\nZ\n1 X \u221e\n|Im\u03c7c (q, \u03c9)| d\u03c9 = 2\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b4)N,\n(42)\n\u03c0N\n\u2212\u221e\nq6=0\n\nwhile in the LDA-DFT method one has\nZ\n1 X \u221e\nLDA\n|Im\u03c7c (q, \u03c9)|\nd\u03c9 = (1 \u2212 \u03b4)N.\n\u03c0N\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(43)\n\nq6=0\n\n(LDA)\n\n(exp)\n\n\u226a \u0393\u03c9(q) (for some phonon\nThe inequality \u0393\u03c9(q)\nmodes) together with Eqs.(42-43) means that for low\ndoping \u03b4 \u226a 1 the LDA strongly underestimates the EPI\ncoupling constant in the large portion of the Brillouin\n(LDA)\n(exp)\nzone, i.e. one has gq\n\u226a gq\n. The large softening and the large line width of the half-breathing mode\nat q = (0.5, 0) but very moderate effects for the breathing mode at q = (0.5, 0.5) is explained in the framework\nof the one slave-boson (SB) theory (for U = \u221e) in [135],\nwhere \u03c7c (q, \u03c9) (i.e. \u0393c (p, q) = \u0393c (p, q)) is calculated in\nleading O(1/N ) order. We stress that there is another\nmethod for studying strong correlations - the X-method,\nwhere the controllable 1/N expansion is performed in\nterms of Hubbard operators and where the charge vertex \u0393c (p, q) is calculated [3], [51], [96], [97]. It turns out\nthat in the adiabatic limit (i\u03c9 n = 0) the vertex functions\n\u0393c (pF , q) in two methods have some important differ(X)\nences. For instance, \u0393c (pF , q) (in the X-method) is\npeaked at q = 0 - the so called forward scattering peak,\n(SB)\nwhile \u0393c (pF , q) has maximum at finite q 6= 0 [141] (X)\nsee Part II, Section VI.E. The properties of \u0393c (pF , q)\nare confirmed by numerical Monte Carlo calculations in\nthe finite-U Hubbard model [168], where it is found that\nFSP exists for all U , but it is especially pronounced in\nthe limit U \u226b t. These results are also confirmed in [171]\nwhere the calculations are performed in the four slavebosons technique - see more Part II Section VII.E. Having\nin mind this difference it would be useful to have calculations of \u03c7c (q, \u03c9) in the framework of the X-method which\nare unfortunately not done yet. Second, the many body\n\ntheory gives that for coupling to some modes the coupling constant |gq | in HTSC cuprates can be significantly\nlarger than LDA-DFT predicts [6], which is due to some\nmany-body effects not present in the latter [133]. In Part\nII it will be argued that for some phonon modes one has\n2\n\n(LDA)\n\n|gq | \u226b gq\n\n2\n\n. For instance, for the half-breathing\n2\n\n2\n\nmode, one has |gq | \u2248 3 |gq |LDA [6], [133] - see Part II.\nThese two results point to an inadequacy of LDA-DFT in\ncalculations of EPI effects in HTSC cuprates. Third, the\nphonon self-energy (\u03a0(q)) and quasi-particle self-energy\n\u03a3(k) are differently renormalized by strong correlations\n[3], [6], [51], [96], [97], which is the reason that \u03a0(q) is\nmuch more suppressed than \u03a3(k) - see Part II. The effects of the charge vertex on \u03a0(q) and \u03a3(k) are differently\nmanifested. Namely, the vertex function enters quadratically in \u03a3(k) and the presence of the forward scattering\npeak in the charge vertex strongly affects the EPI coupling constant gq in \u03a3(k)\nX\n2\n\u03a3(k) = \u2212\n|gq * \u03b3 c (k, q)| D(q)g(k + q),\n(44)\nq\n\nwhere g(k)(\u2261 G(k)/Q) is the quasi-particle Green's function, \u03b3 c (k, q) = \u0393c (k, q)/Q is the quasi-particle vertex and Q(\u223c \u03b4) is the Hubbard quasi-particle spectral\nweight - see Part II, Section VII. In the adiabatic limit\n|q| > q\u03c9 = \u03c9 ph /vF one has \u03b3 c (k, q) \u2248 \u03b3 c (k, q) and for\nq \u226b qc (\u2248 \u03b4 *\u03c0/a) the charge vertex is strongly suppressed\n(\u03b3 c (k, q) \u226a 1) making the effective EPI coupling (which\nalso enters the pairing potential) small at large (transfer)\nmomenta q. This has strong repercussion on the pairing\ndue to EPI since for small doping it makes the d-wave\npairing coupling constant to be of the order of the s-one\n(\u03bbd \u2248 \u03bbs ). Then in the presence of the residual Coulomb\ninteraction EPI gives rise to d-wave pairing. On the other\nside the charge vertex \u0393c (k, q) enters \u03a0(q) linearly and\nit is additionally integrated over the quasi-particle momentum k - see Eq.(41). Therefore, one expects that\nthe effects of the forward scattering peak on \u03a0(q) are\nless pronounced than on \u03a3(k). Nevertheless, the peak\nof \u0393c (k, q) at q = 0 may be (partly) responsible that\nthe maximal experimental softening and broadening of\nthe stretching (half-breading) mode in La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4\nand Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 is at qhb = (0.3, 0, 0) [134] and not at\nqhb = (0.5, 0) for which gqb reaches maximum. This\nmeans that the charge vertex function pushes the renormalized EPI coupling constant to smaller q. It would be\nvery interesting to have calculations for other phonons by\nincluding the vertex function obtained by the X-method\n- see Section.VII\n2.\n\nThe phonon Raman scattering\n\nThe phonon Raman scattering gives an indirect evidence for importance of EPI in cuprates [142], [143],\n[144]. We enumerate some of them - see more in [3] and\nReferences therein. (i) There is a pronounced asymmetric\n\n\f35\nline-shape (of the Fano resonance) in the metallic state.\nFor instance, in Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 two Raman modes at 115\ncm\u22121 (Ba dominated mode) and at 340 cm\u22121 (O dominated mode in the CuO2 planes) show pronounced asymmetry which is absent in Y Ba2 Cu3 O6 . This asymmetry\nmeans that there is an appreciable interaction of Raman\nactive phonons with continuum states (quasi-particles).\n(ii) The phonon frequencies for some A1g and B1g are\nstrongly renormalized in the superconducting state, between (6\u221210) %, pointing again to the importance of EPI\n[144] - see also in [3], [23]. To this point we mention that\nthere is a remarkable correlation between the electronic\nRaman cross-section S\u0303exp (\u03c9) and the optical conductivity in the a \u2212 b plane \u03c3(\u03c9), i.e. S\u0303exp (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c3 ab (\u03c9) [3].\nIn previous Subsections it is argued that EPI with the\nvery broad spectral function \u03b12 F (\u03c9) (0 < \u03c9 . 80 meV )\nexplains in a natural way the \u03c9 and T dependence of\n\u03c3 ab (\u03c9). This means that the electronic Raman spectra\nin cuprates can be explained by EPI in conjunction with\nstrong correlations. This conclusion is supported by calculations of the Raman cross-section [145] which take into\naccount EPI with \u03b12 F (\u03c9) extracted from tunnelling measurements in Y Ba2 Cu3 O6+x and Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+x [3],\n[27]-[32]. Quite similar properties (to cuprates) of the\nelectronic Raman scattering, as well as of \u03c3(\u03c9), R(\u03c9)\nand \u03c1(T ), were observed in experiments [74] on isotropic\n3D metallic oxides La0.5 Sr0.5 CoO3 and Ca0.5 Sr0.5 RuO3\nwhere there are no signs of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. This means that low-dimensionality and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations cannot be a prerequisite for\nanomalous scattering of quasi-particles and EPI must be\ninevitably taken into account since it is present in all\nthese compounds.\n\nF.\n\nIsotope effect in Tc and \u03a3(k, \u03c9)\n\nThe isotope effect \u03b1TC in the critical temperature Tc\nwas one of the very important proof for the EPI pairing in low-temperature superconductors (LTSC). As a\ncuriosity the isotope effect in LT SC systems was measured almost exclusively in mono-atomic systems and in\nfew polyatomic systems: the hydrogen isotope effect in\nP dH, the M o and Se isotope shift of Tc in M o6 Se8 , and\nthe isotope effect in N b3 Sn and M gB2 . We point out\nthat very small (\u03b1TC \u2248 0 in Zr and Ru) and even negative (in P dH) isotope effect in some polyatomic systems\nof LT SC materials are compatible with the EP I pairing\nmechanism but in the presence of substantial Coulomb\ninteraction or lattice anharmonicity. The isotope effect\n\u03b1TC cannot be considered as the smoking gun effect since\nit is sensitive to numerous influences. For instance, in\nM gB2 it is with certainty proved that the pairing is due\nto EPI and strongly dominated by the boron vibrations,\nbut the boron isotope effect is significantly reduced, i.e.\n\u03b1TC \u2248 0.3 and the origin for this smaller value is still unexplained. The situation in HTSC cuprates is much more\ncomplicated because they are strongly correlated systems\n\nand contain many-atoms in unit cell. Additionally, the\nsituation is complicated with the presence of intrinsic\nand extrinsic inhomogeneities, low dimensionality which\ncan mask the isotope effects. On the other hand new\ntechniques such as ARPES, STM, \u03bcSR allow studies of\nthe isotope effects in quasi-particle self-energies, i.e. \u03b1\u03a3 ,\nwhich will be discussed below.\n\n1.\n\nIsotope effect \u03b1TC in Tc\n\nThis problem will be discussed only briefly since more\nextensive discussion can be found in [3]. It is well\nknown that in the pure EPI pairing mechanism, the toP\n(p)\ntal isotope coefficient \u03b1 is given by \u03b1TC = i,p \u03b1i =\nP\n(p)\n(p)\n\u2212 i,p d ln Tc /d ln Mi , where Mi is the mass of the\ni-th element in the p-th crystallographic position. We\nstress that the total isotope effect is not measured in\nHTSC cuprates but only some partial ones. Note,\nthat in the case when the screened Coulomb interaction is negligible, i.e. \u03bc\u2217c = 0, the theory predicts\n\u03b1TC = 1/2. From this formula one can deduce that\nthe relative change of Tc , \u03b4Tc /Tc , for heavier elements\nshould be rather small - for instance it is 0.02 for\n135\nBa \u2192138 Ba, 0.03 for 63 Cu \u219265 Cu and 0.07 for\n138\nLa \u2192139 La. This means that measurements of\n\u03b1i for heavier elements are at/or beyond the ability of\npresent day experimental techniques. Therefore most\nisotope effect measurements were done by substituting\nlight atoms 16 O by 18 O only. It turns out that in\nmost optimally doped HTSC cuprates \u03b1O is rather small.\nFor instance \u03b1O \u2248 0.02 \u2212 0.05 in Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 with\nTc,max \u2248 91 K, but it is appreciable in La1.85 Sr0.15 CuO4\nwith Tc,max \u2248 35 K where \u03b1O \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2. In\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 with Tc,max \u2248 76 K one has \u03b1O \u2248\n0.03 \u2212 0.05 while \u03b1O \u2248 0.03 and even negative (\u22120.013)\nin Bi2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu2 O10 with Tc,max \u2248 110 K. The experiments on T l2 Can\u22121 BaCun O2n+4 (n = 2, 3) with\nTc,max \u2248 121 K are still unreliable and \u03b1O is unknown.\nIn the electron-doped (N d1\u2212x Cex )2 CuO4 with Tc,max \u2248\n24 K one has \u03b1O < 0.05 while in the underdoped materials \u03b1O increases. The largest \u03b1O is obtained even in the\noptimally doped compounds like in systems with substitution, such as La1.85 Sr0.15 Cu1\u2212x Mx O4 , M = F e, Co,\nwhere \u03b1O \u2248 1.3 for x \u2248 0.4 %. In La2\u2212x Mx CuO4 there\nis a Cu isotope effect which is of the order of the oxygen one, i.e. \u03b1Cu \u2248 \u03b1O giving \u03b1Cu + \u03b1O \u2248 0.25 \u2212 0.35\nfor optimally doped systems (x = 0.15). In case when\nx = 0.125 with Tc \u226a Tc,max one has \u03b1Cu \u2248 0.8 \u2212 1\nwith \u03b1Cu + \u03b1O \u2248 1.8 [146]. The appreciation of copper\nisotope effect in La2\u2212x Mx CuO4 tells us that vibrations\nother than oxygen ions are important in giving high Tc .\nIn that sense one should have in mind the tunnelling experiments discussed above, which tell us that all phonons\ncontribute to the Eliashberg pairing function \u03b12 F (k, \u03c9)\nand according to these results the oxygen modes give\nmoderate contribution to Tc [32]. Hence the small oxy-\n\n\f36\n(O)\n\ngen isotope effect \u03b1Tc in optimally doped cuprates, if it\nis an intrinsic property at all (due to pronounced local\ninhomogeneities of samples and quasi-two dimensionality\nof the system), does not exclude the EPI mechanism of\npairing.\n2.\n\nIsotope effect \u03b1\u03a3 in the self-energy\n\nThe fine structure of the quasi-particle self-energy\n\u03a3(k, \u03c9), such as kinks and slopes, can be resolved in\nARPES measurements and in some respect in STM. It\nturns out that there is isotope effect in the self-energy\nin the optimally doped Bi \u2212 2212 samples [105], [108],\n[109]. In the first paper on this subject [105] it is reported a red shift \u03b4\u03c9 k,70 \u223c \u2212(10 \u2212 15) meV of the nodal\nkink at \u03c9 k,70 \u2243 70 meV for the 16 O \u2192 O18 substitution.\nIn [105] it is reported that the isotope shift of the selfenergy \u03b4\u03a3 = \u03a316 \u2212 \u03a318 \u223c 10 meV is very pronounced at\nlarge energies \u03c9 = 100 \u2212 300 meV . Concerning the latter\nresult, there is a dispute since it is not confirmed experimentally in [108], [109]. However, the isotope effect in\nRe\u03a3(k, \u03c9) at low energies [108], [109] is well described in\nthe framework of the Migdal-Eliashberg theory for EPI\n[107] which is in accordance with the recent ARPES measurements with low-energy photons \u223c 7 eV [147]. The\nlatter allowed very good precision in measuring the isotope effect in the nodal point of Bi-2212 with Tc16 = 92.1\nK and Tc18 = 91.1 K [147]. They observed shift in the\nmaximum of Re\u03a3(kN , \u03c9) - at \u03c9 k,70 \u2248 70 meV (it corresponds to the half-breathing or to the breathing phonon)\nby \u03b4\u03c9 k,70 \u2248 3.4 \u00b1 0.5 meV as shown in Fig. 35.\nBy analyzing the shift in Im\u03a3(kN , \u03c9) - shown in Fig.\n35, one finds similar result for \u03b4\u03c9 k,70 \u2248 3.2 \u00b1 0.6 meV .\nThe similar shift was obtained in STM measurements [39]\nwhich is shown in Fig. 33(b) and can have its origin in different phonons. We would like to stress two points: (i) in\ncompounds with Tc \u223c 100 K the oxygen isotope effect in\n(O)\nTc is moderate, i.e. \u03b1Tc < 0.1, [147]. If we consider this\nvalue to be intrinsic then even in this case it is not in conflict with the tunnelling experiments [32] since the latter\ngive evidence that vibrations of heavier ions contribute\nsignificantly to Tc - see the discussion in Subsection D\non the tunnelling spectroscopy; (ii) in ARPES measurements of [147] the effective EPI coupling constant \u03bbep,ef f\n& 0.6 is extracted, while the theory in Subsection C gives\nthat the real coupling constant is larger, i.e. \u03bbep > 1.2.\nThis value is significantly larger than the LDA-DFT theory predicts \u03bbep,LDA < 0.3 [16], [17]. This again points\nthat the LDA-DFT method does not pick up the manybody effects due to strong correlations- see Part II.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY OF PART I\n\nThe analysis of experimental data in HTSC cuprates\nwhich are related to optics, tunnelling and ARPES measurements near and at the optimal doping give evidence\n\nFIG. 35. (a) Effective Re\u03a3 for five samples for O16 (blue) and\nO18 (red) along the nodal direction. (b) Effective Im\u03a3 determined from MDC full widths. An impurity term is subtracted\nat \u03c9 = 0. From [147].\n\nfor the large electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with the\ncoupling constant 1 < \u03bbep < 3.5. We stress that\nthis analysis is done in the framework of the MigdalEliashberg theory for EPI which is a reliable approach for\nsystems near the optimal doping. The spectral function\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9), averaged over the Fermi surface, is extracted\nfrom various tunnelling measurements on bulk materials\nand tin films. It contains peaks at the same energies as\nthe phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9). So obtained spectral\nfunction when inserted in the Eliashberg equations provides sufficient strength for obtaining high critical temperature Tc \u223c 100 K. These facts are a solid proof for\nthe important role of EPI in the normal state scattering\nand pairing mechanism of cuprates. Such a large (experimental) value of the EPI coupling constant and the robustness of the d-wave superconductivity in the presence\nof impurities imply that the EPI and impurity scattering amplitude must be strongly momentum dependent.\nThe IR optical reflectivity data provide additional support for the importance of EPI since by using the spectral function (extracted from tunnelling measurements)\none can quantitatively explain frequency dependence of\nthe dynamical conductivity, optical relaxation rate and\noptical mass. These findings related to EPI are additionally supported by ARPES measurements on BISCO\n\n\f37\ncompounds. The ARPES kinks, the phononic features\nand isotope effect in the quasi-particle self-energy in the\nnodal and anti-nodal points at low energies (\u03c9 \u226a \u03c9 c ) persist in the normal and superconducting state. They are\nmuch more in favor of EPI than for the spin fluctuation\n(SFI) scattering mechanism. The transport EPI coupling\nconstant in HTSC cuprates is much smaller than \u03bbep ,\ni.e. \u03bbtr \u223c \u03bbep /3, which points to some peculiar scattering mechanism not met in low-temperature superconductors. The different renormalization of the quasi-particle\nand transport self-energies by the Coulomb interaction\n(strong correlations) hints to the importance of the smallmomentum scattering in EPI. This will be discussed in\nPart II.\nThe ineffectiveness of SFI to solely provide pairing\nmechanism in cuprates comes out also from magnetic\nneutron scattering on YBCO, BISCO. As a result, the\nimaginary part of the susceptibility is drastically reduced\nin the low energy region by going from slightly underdoped toward optimally doped systems, while Tc is practically unchanged. This implies that the real SFI cou2\npling constant \u03bbsf (\u223c gsf\n) is small since the experimental\n(exp)\n\nvalue gsf\n\n< 0.2 eV is much smaller than the assumed\n(th)\n\ntheoretical value gsf \u2248 (0.7 \u2212 1.5) eV .\nInelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements in\ncuprates show that the broadening of some phonon lines\nis by an order of magnitude larger than the LDA-DFA\nmethods predict. Since the phonon line-widths depend\non the EPI coupling and the charge susceptibility it is evident that calculations of both quantities are beyond the\nrange of applicability of LDA-DFT. As a consequence,\nLDA-DFT overestimates electronic screening and thus\nunderestimates the EPI coupling, since many-body effects due to strong correlations are not contained in this\nmean-field type theory. However, in spite of the promising and encouraging experimental results about the dominance of EPI in cuprates the theory is still confronted\nwith difficulties in explaining sufficiently large coupling\nconstant in the d-channel. At present there is no such a\nsatisfactory microscopic theory although some concepts,\nsuch as the the dominant EPI scattering at small transfer momenta, are understood at least qualitatively. These\nset of problems and questions will be discussed in Part\nII.\n\nPart II\n\nTheory of EPI in HTSC\nThe experimental results in Part I give evidence that\nthe electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in HTSC cuprates\nis strong and in order to be conform with d-wave pairing EPI must be peaked at small transfer momenta. A\nnumber of other experiments in HTSC cuprates give evidence that these are strongly correlated systems with\nlarge on-site Coulomb repulsion of electrons on the Cu-\n\nions. However, at present there is no satisfactory microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC cuprates which is\ncapable to calculate Tc and the order parameter. This\nis due to mathematical difficulties in obtaining a solution of the formally exact ab initio many-body equations\nwhich take into account two important ingredients - EPI\nand strong correlations [3]. In Section V we discuss\nfirst the ab initio many body theory of superconductivity in order to point places which are most difficult\nto be solved. Since the superconductivity is low energy\nphenomenon (also in HTSC cuprates) one can simplify\nthe structure of the ab initio equations in the low-energy\nsector (the Migdal-Eliashberg theory) where the highenergy processes are incorporated in the (so called) ideal\nband structure (non-local) potential VIBS (x, y) and vertex functions \u0393. Due to its complexity this program of\ncalculation of VIBS (x, y), \u0393, EPI couplings gep (x, y) is\nnot realized in HTSC superconductors. However, one\npragmatical way out is to calculate gep in the framework\nof the LDA-DFT method which is at present stage unable to treat strong correlations in a satisfactory manner.\nSome achievements and results of LDA-DFT which are\nrelated to HTSC cuprates are discussed in Section VI.\nIn the case of very complicated systems, such as the\nHTSC cuprates, the standard (pragmatical) procedure\nin physics is to formulate a minimal theoretical model\n- sometimes called toy model, which includes minimal\nset of important ingredients necessary for qualitative and\nand semi-quantitative study of a phenomenon. As the\nconsequence of the experimental results, the minimal theoretical model for cuprates must comprise two important\ningredients: 1. EPI and 2. strong correlations. In Section VII we shall introduce such a minimal theoretical\nt \u2212 J model which includes EPI and discuss the renormalization of EPI by strong correlations. In recent years\nthe interest in this set of problems is increased and numerous numerical calculations were done mostly on small\nclusters with n \u00d7 n atoms (n < 8). We shall not discuss\nthis subject which is fortunately covered in the recent\ncomprehensive review [6]. The analytical approaches in\nstudying the renormalization of EPI by strong correlations, which are based on a controllable and systematic\ntheory, are rather scarce. We shall discuss such a systematic and controllable theory in the framework of the t\u2212J\nmodel with EP I, which is formulated and solved in terms\nof Hubbard operators. The theory of this (toy) model\npredicts some interesting effects which might be important for understanding the physics of HTSC cuprates.\nIt predicts that the high-energy processes (due to the\nsuppression of doubly occupancy for U \u226b Wb ) give rise\nto a nonlocal contribution to the band structure potential (self-energy \u03a3(x, y, \u03c9 = 0)) as well as to EPI. This\nnon-locality in EPI is responsible for the peak in the effective pairing potential (Vep,ef f (q, \u03c9)) at small transfer momenta q(6 qc \u226a kF ) [3], [51], [96]. The latter\nproperty allows that the (strong) EPI is conform with\nd-wave pairing in HTSC cuprates. Furthermore, the peculiar structural properties of HTSC cuprates and cor-\n\n\f38\nresponding electronic quasi-two-dimensionality give an\nadditional non-locality in EPI. The latter is due to the\nweakly screened Madelung energy for a number of lattice vibrations along the c-axis. Since at present there is\nno quantitative theory for the latter effect we tackle this\nproblem here only briefly. The next task for the future\nstudies of the physics of HTSC cuprates is to incorporate these structural properties in the minimal theoretical model problem.\nFinally, by writing this chapter our intention is not to\noverview the theoretical studies of EPI in HTSC cuprates\n- an impossible task, but more (i) to elucidate the descending way from the (old) well-defined ab initio microscopic theory of superconductivity to the one of the minimal model which treats the interplay of EPI and strong\ncorrelations, (ii) to encourage the reader to further develop the theory of HTSC cuprates.\nV.\n\nA.\n\nMICROSCOPIC THEORY OF\nSUPERCONDUCTIVITY\nAb iniitio many-body theory\n\nThe many-body theory of superconductivity is based\non the fully microscopic electron-ion Hamiltonian for\nelectrons and ions in the crystal - see for instance [148],\n[149]. It comprises mutually interacting electrons which\nalso interact with ions and ionic vibrations. In order to pass continually to the problem of interplay of\nEPI and strong correlations and also to explain why\nthe LDA-DFT method is inadequate for HTSC cuprates\nwe discuss this problem here with restricted details more extended discussion can be found in [3], [149].

Fortunately, we are\nmostly interested in low-energy phenomena (with energies |\u03c9 n | , \u03be \u226a \u03c9 c and for momenta k = kF + \u03b4k in\nthe shall \u03b4k \u226a \u03b4kc near the Fermi momentum kF ; \u03c9 c\nand \u03b4kc are some cutoffs which disappear after calculations) which allows us further simplification of equations [1]. Therefore, the strategy is to integrate highenergy processes - see more in [149], and we sketch it\nonly briefly. Namely, the Green's function \u011c(k, \u03c9 n ) =\n[i\u03c9n \u2212 (k2 /2m \u2212 \u03bc)\u03c4\u0302 3 \u2212 \u03a3\u0302(k, \u03c9 n )]\u22121 can be formally written in the form \u011c(k, \u03c9 n ) = \u011clow (k, \u03c9 n ) + \u011chigh (k, \u03c9 n ),\nwhere \u011clow (k, \u03c9 n ) = \u011c(k, \u03c9 n )\u0398(\u03c9 c \u2212 |\u03c9n |)\u0398(\u03b4kc \u2212 \u03b4k)\nis the low-energy Green's function and \u011chigh (k, \u03c9 n ) =\n\u011c(k, \u03c9 n )\u0398(|\u03c9 n |\u2212\u03c9c )\u0398(\u03b4k\u2212\u03b4kc ) the high-energy one and\nanalogously D = Dlow (k, \u03c9 n ) + Dhigh (k, \u03c9 n ). By introducing the small parameter of the theory s \u223c (\u03c9/\u03c9 c ) \u223c\n(\u03b4k/\u03b4kc ) \u226a 1 one has in leading order \u011clow (k, \u03c9 n ) \u223c s\u22121 ,\n\u011chigh (k, \u03c9 n ) . 1 and Dlow (k, \u03c9 n ) \u223c s0 , Dhigh (k, \u03c9 n ) \u223c\ns2 . Note, that the coupling constants (Vei , \u2207Vei , Vii etc.)\nare of the order s0 = 1.\nThis procedure of separating low-energy and highenergy processes lies also behind the adiabatic approximation since in most materials the characteristic phonon\n(Debye) energy of lattice vibrations \u03c9D is much smaller\nthan the characteristic electronic Fermi energy EF\n(\u03c9 D \u226a EF ). In the small s(\u226a 1) limit the Migdal theory [1] keeps in the total self-energy \u03a3 linear terms in the\nphonon propagator D\u0303 (D) only. In that case the effective\nvertex function can be written in the form \u0393\u0302ef f (1, 2; 3) \u223c\n=\n\u0393\u0302c (1, 2; 3) + \u03b4 \u0393\u0302ep (1, 2; 3) [1], where the Coulomb charge\nvertex \u0393\u0302c (1, 2; 3) = \u03c4\u0302 3 \u03b4(1\u22122)\u03b4(1\u22123)+\u03b4 \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2)/\u03b4uef f (3)\ncontains correlations due to the Coulomb interaction only\nbut does not contain EP I and phonon propagator D\u0303\nexplicitly. The part \u03b4 \u0393\u0302ep (1, 2; 3) = \u03b4 \u03a3\u0302ep (1, 2)/\u03b4uef f (3)\ncontains all linear terms with respect to EP I. Note,\nthat in these diagrams enters the dressed Green's function which contains implicitly EP I up to infinite order.\nBy careful inspection of all (explicit) contributions to\n\u03b4 \u0393\u0302ep (1, 2; 3) which is linear in D\u0303 one can express the selfenergy in terms of the charge (Coulomb) vertex \u0393\u0302c (1, 2; 3)\nonly. As a result of this approximation, the part of the\nself-energy due to Coulomb interaction is given by\n\u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) = \u2212Vcsc (1, 1\u0304)\u03c4\u0302 3 \u011c(1, 2\u0304)\u0393\u0302c (2\u0304, 2; 1\u0304),\n\n(49)\n\nwhere Vcsc (1, 2) = Vc (1, 2\u0304)\u03b5\u22121\ne (2\u0304, 2) is the screened\nCoulomb interaction. The part which is due to EP I has\nthe following form\n\u03a3\u0302ep (1, 2) = \u2212Vep (1\u0304, 2\u0304)\u0393\u0302c (1, 3\u0304; 1\u0304)\u011c(3\u0304, 4\u0304)\u0393\u0302c (4\u0304, 2; 2\u0304), (50)\n\n\u22121\nwhere Vep (1, 2) = \u03b5\u22121\ne (1, 1\u0304)D\u0303(1\u0304, 2\u0304)\u03b5e (2\u0304, 2) is the\nscreened EP I potential. Note, that \u03a3\u0302ep (1, 2) depends\nnow quadratically on the charge vertex \u0393\u0302c , which is due\nto the adiabatic theorem.\nIt is well known that the Coulomb self-energy \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2)\nis the most complicating part of the electronic dynamics\nbut since we are interested in low-energy physics when\ns \u226a 1 then the term \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) can be further simplified by\nseparating it in two parts\n(l)\n\u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) = \u03a3\u0302(h)\nc (1, 2) + \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2).\n\n(51)\n\n(h)\n\nThe term \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) is due to high-energy processes contained in the product \u011chigh (1, 2\u0304)\u0393\u0302high\n(2\u0304, 2; 1\u0304) (for inc\nstance due to the large Hubbard U in strongly corre(l)\nlated systems) and \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) is due to low energy pro(h)\ncesses. The leading part part of \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) is 1, i.e.\n(l)\n(h)\n\u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) \u223c s0 , while \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) is small of order 1, i.e.\n(l)\n\u03a3\u0302c (1, 2) \u223c s1 . For further purposes we define the quantity V\u03020\nV\u03020 (1, 2) = {Ve\u2212i (1)+VH (1)}\u03c4 3 \u03b4(1\u22122)+ \u03a3\u0302(h)\nc (1, 2). (52)\nwhere Ve\u2212i , VH are also of order s0 . After the Fourier\ntransform with respect to time (and for small |\u03c9 n | \u226a \u03c9 c )\n(h)\n\u03a3\u0302c is given by\n(h)\n\n(h)\n\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u0302(h)\nc (x1 , x2 , \u03c9 n ) \u2243 \u03a3c0 (x1 , x2 , 0)\u03c4\u0302 3 +(\u03a3\u0302c0 ) (x1 , x2 , 0)*i\u03c9 n .\n(53)\n(h)\n(h) \u2032\n0\n1\nAs we said \u03a3c0 \u223c s while (\u03a3\u0302c0 ) * \u03c9n \u223c s because\n(l)\n\u03c9n \u223c s1 . From Eq.(49) it is seen that the part \u03a3\u0302c (1, 2)\ncontains the low-energy Green's function \u011clow (1, 2\u0304) and\nthis skeleton diagram is of order s1 . The similar analysis\nbased on Eq.(50) for \u03a3\u0302ep (1, 2) gives that the leading order\nis s1 which describes the low-energy part of EP I. After\nthe separations of terms (of s0 and s1 orders) the Dyson\nequation in the low-energy region has the form\n\n[i\u03c9n Zc (x, x\u0304) \u2212 \u01240 (x, x\u0304) \u2212 \u03a3\u0302(l)\nc (x, x\u0304,\u03c9 n ) \u2212 \u03a3\u0302ep (x, x\u0304,\u03c9 n )]\n\u00d7 \u011clow (x\u0304, y, \u03c9n ) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\u03c4\u0302 0 ,\n(54)\nR\nwhere x\u0304 means integration d3 x\u0304 over the crystal volume.

The static potential VIBS (x, y) is of order s0 and includes high-energy\nprocesses\nFinally, we obtain the matrix Dyson equation for the\nrenormalized Green's function \u011cr (x, y, \u03c9 n ) which is the\nbasis for the (strong-coupling) Migdal-Eliashberg theory\nin the low-energy region\n[i\u03c9n \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u0304) \u2212 \u01250 (x, x\u0304) \u2212 \u03a3\u0302(l)\nc,r (x, x\u0304,\u03c9 n ) \u2212 \u03a3\u0302ep,r (x, x\u0304,\u03c9 n )]\n\u00d7 \u011cr (x\u0304, y, \u03c9n ) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\u03c4\u0302 0 ,\n\n(60)\n\n(l)\n\nwhere \u03a3\u0302c,r and \u03a3\u0302ep,r have the same form as Eqs.(4950) but with renormalized Green's and vertex functions\n\u011cr , \u0393\u0302r instead of \u011c, \u0393\u0302. We stress that Eq.(60) holds\nin the low-energy region only. In the superconducting\nstate the set of Eliashberg equations in Eq. (60) are\nwriten explicitely in Appendix A, where it is seen that\nthe superconducting properties depend on the Eliashberg\nspectral function \u03b12kp F (\u03c9). The latter function is defined\nalso in Appendix A, Eq.(104), and it depends on material\nproperties of the system.\nThe important ingredients of the low-energy MigdalEliashberg theory is the ideal band-structure Hamiltonian \u01250 (x, y) - given by Eq.(58), which contains manybody (excitation) ideal band-structure non-local periodic\ncrystal potential VIBS (x, y). The Hamiltonian \u01250 (x, y)\ndetermines the ideal energy spectrum \u01eb(k) of the conduction electrons and the wave function \u03c8 i,p (x) through\n\u01250 (x, \u0233)\u03c8 i,k (\u0233) = [\u01ebi (k) \u2212 \u03bc]\u03c8 i,k (x),\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential. We stress that the\nHamiltonian \u01250 (x, y) also governs transport properties\nof metals in low-energy region.\nAfter solving Eq.(61) the next step is to expand all\nrenormalized Green's function, self-energies, vertices and\n\nthe renormalized EP I constant (symbolically gep,r =\ngep,0 \u0393ren /\u03b5e ) in the basis of \u03c8 i,p (x) and write down the\nEliashberg equations in this basis. We shall not elaborate\nfurther this program and we refer the reader to the relevant literature [148], [149]. We point out, that even such\nsimplified program of the low-energy Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory was never fully realized in low-temperature superconductors, because the non-local potential VIBS (x, y)\n(enters the ideal band-structure Hamiltonian h0 (x, y))\nand the renormalized vertex function (entering the EP I\ncoupling constant gep,r ) which include electronic correlations are difficult to calculate especially in strongly\ncorrelated metals. Therefore, it is not surprising at all,\nthat the situation is even worse in HT S materials which\nare strongly correlated systems with complex structural\nand material properties. Due to these difficulties the calculations of the electronic band structure and the EP I\ncoupling is usually done in the framework of LDA-DFT\nwhere the many-body excitation potential VIBS (x, y) is\nreplaced by some (usually local) potential VLDA (x) which\nin fact determines ground state properties of the crystal.\nIn the next section we briefly describe: (i) the LDA-DFT\nprocedure in calculating the EPI coupling constant and\n(ii) some results related to HTSC cuprates. We shall also\ndiscuss why this approximation is a serious drawback if\napplied to HT S materials.\n\nVI.\n\nLDA-DFT CALCULATIONS OF THE EPI\nCOUPLING\n\nWe point out again two results which are important\nfor the future microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC\ncuprates. First, numerous experiment (discussed in Part\nI) give evidence that the EPI coupling constant which\nenters the normal part of the quasi-particle self-energy\nZ\n\u03bbZ\nep = \u03bbs + \u03bbd + ... is rather large, i.e. 1 < \u03bbep < 3.5. In\norder to be conform with d-wave pairing the effective EPI\npotential must be rather nonlocal (peaked at small transfer momenta q) which implies that the s-wave and d-wave\ncoupling constants are of the same order, i.e. \u03bbd \u2248 \u03bbs .\nSecond, the theory based on the minimal t \u2212 J model,\nwhich will be discussed in Section VII, gives that strong\nelectronic correlations produce a peak at small transfer\nmomenta in the effective EPI pairing potential thus giving rise to \u03bbd \u2248 \u03bbs . This is a striking property which\nallows that EPI is conform with d-wave pairing. However, the theory is seriously confronted with the problem\nof calculation of the coupling constants \u03bbZ\nep . It turns out,\nthat at present it is an illusory task to calculate \u03bbZ\nep and\n\u03bbd since it is extremely difficult (if possible at all) to\nincorporate the peculiar structural properties of HTSC\ncuprates (layered structure, ionic-metallic system, etc.)\nand strong correlations effects in a consistent and reliable microscopic theory. As it is stressed several times,\nthe LDA-DFT methods miss some important many body\neffects (especially in the band structure potential) and\ntherefore fail to describe correctly screening properties\n\n\f41\nof HTSC cuprates and the strength of EPI. However, the\nLDA-DFT methods are capable to incorporate structural\nproperties much better than the simplified minimal t \u2212 J\n(toy) model. Here, we discuss briefly some achievements\nof the improved LDA-DFT calculations which are able to\ntake partially into account some nonlocal effects in the\nEPI. The latter are mainly due to the almost ionic structure along the c-axis which is reflected in the very small\nc-axis plasma frequency \u03c9 c \u226a \u03c9 ab ).\nThe main task of the LDA-DFT theory in obtaining\nthe EPI coupling is to calculate the change of the ground\nstate (self-consistent) potential \u03b4Vg (r)/\u03b4R\u03b1 and the EPI\ncoupling constant (matrix element ) g\u03b1LDA (k, k\u2032 ) (see its\ndefinition below) what is the most difficult part of calculations. Since in LDA-DFT there is no EPI coupling, the\nrecipe is that the calculated \"EPI\" coupling is inserted\ninto the Eliashberg equations. By knowing g\u03b1LDA (k, k\u2032 )\none can define the total (\u03bb) and partial (\u03bbq,\u03bd ) EP I coupling constants for the \u03bd-th mode, respectively [150]\n\u03bb=\n\n1 X\n\u03bbq,\u03bd ,\nN p q,\u03bd\n\n\u03bbq,\u03bd =\n\np\u03b3 q,\u03bd\n,\n\u03c0N (0)\u03c9q,\u03bd\n\n(62)\n\nwhere p = 3\u03ba is the number of phonon branches (\u03ba is the\nnumber of atoms in the unit cell) and N (0) is the density\nof states at the Fermi energy (per spin and unit cell).\nThe phonon line-width \u03b3 q,\u03bd is defined in the MigdalEliashberg theory by\n\u03b3 q,\u03bd = 2\u03c0\u03c9q,\u03bd\n\n1\n1 X\n2\n| e\u03b1\n\u03bd (q)*g\u03b1,ll\u2032 (k, k\u2212q) |\nN \u2032 2M \u03c9k\u2212q,\u03bd\nll k\n\nnF (\u03be l,k ) \u2212 nF (\u03be l,k + ~\u03c9 q,\u03bd )\n]\u03b4(\u03be l\u2032 ,k\u2212q \u2212 \u03be l,k \u2212 ~\u03c9q,\u03bd ).\n~\u03c9 q,\u03bd\n(63)\nHere, e\u03b1\n\u03bd (q) is the phonon polarization vectors, nF is the\nFermi function. Since the ideal energy spectrum from\nEq. (61) \u03be l,k = El,k \u2212 \u03bc and the corresponding eigenfunctions \u03c8 kl are unknown then instead of these one sets\nin Eq.

In the\npast various approximations within the LDA \u2212 DF T\nmethod have been used in calculating \u03b4Vg (r)/\u03b4R\u03b1 and\n\u03bb while here we comment some of them only: (i) In\nmost calculations in LT S systems and in HT SC cuprates\nthe rigid-ion (RI) approximation was used as well as\nits further simplifications which inevitable (due to its\n\nshortcomings and obtained small \u03bb) deserves to be commented. The RI approximation is based on the very\nspecific assumption that the ground-state (crystal) potential Vg (r) can P\nbe considered as a sum of ionic potentials Vg (r) =\nn Vg (r \u2212 Rn ) where the ion potential Vg (r \u2212 Rn ) and the electron density \u03c1e (r) are carried\nrigidly with the ion at Rn during the ion displacement\n(Rn = R0n + \u00fb\u03b1n ). In the RI approximation the change\nof Vg (r) is given by\nX\n\u03b4Vg (r) =\n\u2207\u03b1 Vg (r \u2212 R0n )u\u03b1n\n(65)\nn\n\n\u03b4Vg (r)\n= \u2207\u03b1 Vg (r \u2212 R0n ),\n\u03b4Rn\u03b1\n\n(66)\n\nwhich means that RI does not take into account changes\nof the electron density during the ion displacements. In\nnumerous calculations applied to HT SC cuprates the\nrigid-ion model is even further simplified by using the\nrigid muffin-tin approximation (RM T A) (or similar version with the rigid-atomic sphere) - see discussions in\n[150], [151], [152]. The RM T A assumes that the groundstate potential and the electron density follow ion displacements rigidly inside the Wigner-Seitz cell but outside it Vg (r) is not changed because of the assumed very\ngood metallic screening (for instance in simple metals)\n\u2207\u03b1 Vg (r \u2212 Rn ) = {\n\n\u2207\u03b1 Vg (r \u2212 Rn ), r in cell n\n. (67)\n0,\noutside\n\nThis means that the dominant EP I scattering is due to\nthe nearby atoms only and that the scattering potential\nis isotropic. All nonlocal effects related to the interaction of electrons with ions far away, are neglected in the\nLDA\nRM T A. In this case g\u03b1,n\n(k, k\u2032 ) is calculated by the\nwave function centered at the given ion R0n which can\nbe expanded inside the muffin-tin sphere (outside it the\npotential is assumed to be constant) in the angular momentum basis {l, m}, i.e.\nX\n(RMT A)\nhr | \u03c8 k\ni=\nClm (k, R0n )\u03c1l (| r \u2212 R0n |)Ylm (\u03c6, \u03b8)\nlm\n\n(68)\n(the angles \u03c6, \u03b8 are related to the vector r\u0302 = (r \u2212 R0n )/ |\nr \u2212 R0n |). The radial function \u03c1l (| r \u2212 R0n |) is zero outside the muffin-tin sphere. In that case the EP I matrix\nRMT A\n(k, k\u2032 ) \u223c hYlm | r\u0302 | Yl\u2032 m\u2032 i\nelement is given by g\u03b1,n\nand because r\u0302 is a vector the selection rule implies that\nonly terms with \u2206l \u2261 l\u2032 \u2212 l = \u00b11 contribute to the\nEP I coupling constant in the RM T A. This result is\nan immediate consequence of the assumed locality of\nthe EP I potential in RM T A. However, since nonlocal effects, such as the long-range Madelung-like interaction, are important in HT SC cuprates then additional\nterms contribute also to the coupling constant g\u03b1,n , i.e.\nRMT A\nnonloc\ng\u03b1,n (k, k\u2032 ) = g\u03b1,n\n(k, k\u2032 ) + g\u03b1,n\n(k, k\u2032 ), where a part\nnonloc\nnonloc\n(\u03b4g\u03b1,n\n) of the nonlocal contribution to g\u03b1,n\nis represented schematically\nnonloc\n\u03b4g\u03b1,n\n(k, k\u2032 ) \u223c hYlm | (R0n \u2212 R0m )\u03b1 | Yl\u2032 m\u2032 i\n\n(69)\n\n\f42\nFrom Eq.(69) comes out the selection rule \u2206l = l\u2032 \u2212 l = 0\nfor the nonlocal part of the E \u2212 P interaction. We\nstress that the \u2206l = 0 (nonlocal) terms are omitted\nin the RM T A approach and therefore it is not surprising that this approximation works satisfactory in elemental (isotropic) metals only. The latter are characterized by the large density of states at the Fermi surface which makes electronic screening very efficient. This\ngives rise to a local EP I where an electron feels potential changes of the nearby atom only. One can claim\nwith certainty, that the RM T A method is not suitable\nfor HT SC cuprates which are highly anisotropic systems with pronounced ionic character of binding and\npronounced strong electronic correlations. The RM T A\nmethod applied to HT SC cuprates misses just this important part - the long-range part EP I due to the change\nof the long range Madelung energy in the almost ionic\nstructure of HTSC cuprates. For instance, the first calculations done in [153] which are based on the RM T A\ngive very small EP I coupling constant \u03bbRMT A \u223c 0.1 in\nY BCO, which is in apparent contradiction with the experimental finding that \u03bbep is large - discussed in Part\nI.\nHowever, these nonlocal effects are taken into account\nin [150] by using the frozen-in phonon (F IP ) method\nin evaluating of \u03bbep in La2\u2212x Mx CuO4 . In this method\nsome symmetric phonons are considered and the band\nstructure is calculated for the system with the super-cell\nwhich is determined by the periodicity of the phonon\ndisplacement. By comparing the unperturbed and perturbed energies the corresponding EP I coupling \u03bb\u03bd (for\nthe considered phonon \u03bd-th mode) is found. More precisely speaking, in this approach the matrix elements of\n\u03ba\nare determined from the finite difference of\n\u03b4Vg (r)/\u03b4R0,\u03b1\nthe ground-state potential\n\u2206Vg,q,\u03bd (r) = Vg (R\u03ba0,L + \u2206\u03c4 \u03baq,\u03bd (L)) \u2212 Vg (R\u03ba0,L )\n=\n\nX\nL,\u03ba\n\n\u2206\u03c4 \u03baq,\u03bd (L)\n\n\u2202Vg (R\u03ba0,L )\n,\n\u2202R\u03ba0,L\n\n(70)\n\nwhere L, \u03ba enumerate elementary lattice cells\nand atoms in the unit cell, respectively.\nThe\nfrozen-in atomic displacements of the phonon\n\u2206\u03c4 \u03baq,\u03bd (L) of the \u03bd-th mode is given by \u2206\u03c4 \u03baq,\u03bd (L) =\n\u2206uq,\u03bd (~/2M\u03ba \u03c9 q,\u03bd )1/2 Re[e\u03ba,\u03bd (q)eiq*R ] where \u2206uq,\u03bd is\nthe dimensionless phonon amplitude and the phonon\npolarization (eigen)vector e\u03ba,\u03bd (q) fulfills the condition\nP\n\u2217\n\u03ba e\u03ba,\u03bd (q) * e\u03ba,\u03bd \u2032 (q) = \u03b4 \u03bd,\u03bd \u2032 . Based on this approach\nvarious symmetric Ag (and some B3g ) modes of\nLa2\u2212x Mx CuO4 were studied [150], where it was found\nthat the large matrix elements are due to unusually\nlong-range Madelung-like, especial for the c-axis phonon\nmodes. The obtained large \u03bbep \u2248 1.37 is the consequence\nof the following three main facts: (i) The electronic\nspectrum in HT SC cuprates is highly anisotropic, i.e.\nit is quasi-two-dimensional. This is an important fact\n\nfor pairing because if the conduction electrons would be\nuniformly spread over the whole unit cell then due to the\nrather low electron density (n \u223c 1021 cm\u22123 ) the density\nof states on the Cu and O in-plane atoms would be an\norder of magnitude smaller than the real value. This\nwould further give an order of magnitude smaller EP I\ncoupling constant \u03bbep . Note, that the calculated density\nof states on the (heavy) Cu and (light) O in-plane\natoms, N Cu (0) \u223c\n= 0.35\n= 0.54 states/eV and N Oxy (0) \u223c\nstates/eV , are of same order of magnitude as in some\nLT S materials. For instance, in N bC where Tc \u2248 11\nK one has on (the heavy) N b atom N N b (0) \u223c\n= 0.58\nstates/eV and on (the light) C atom N C (0) \u223c\n= 0.25\nstates/eV . So, the quasi-two-dimensional character of\nthe spectrum is crucial in obtaining appreciable density\nof states on the light O atoms in the CuO2 planes. (ii)\nIn HT SC cuprates there is strong Cu \u2212 O hybridization\nleading to good in-plane metallic properties. This large\ncovalency in the plane is due to the (fortunately) small\nenergy separation of the electron levels on Cu and\nOxy atoms which comes out from the band structure\ncalculations [154], i.e. \u2206 =| \u01ebCu \u2212 \u01ebOxy |\u2248 3 eV . The\nlatter value gives rise to strong covalent mixing (the\nhybridization parameter tpd ) of the Cudx2 \u2212y2 and Opx,y\nstates, i.e. tpd = \u22121.85 eV . It is interesting, that\nthe small value of \u2206 is not due to the ionic structure\n(crystal field effect) of the system but it is mainly due\nto the natural falling of the Cudx2 \u2212y2 states across the\ntransition-metal series. So, the natural closeness of the\nenergy levels of the Cudx2 \u2212y2 and Opx,y states is this\ndistinctive feature of HT SC cuprates which basically\nallows achievement of high Tc . (iii) The ionic structure\nof HTSC cuprates which is very pronounced along the\nc-axis is responsible for the weak electronic screening\nalong this axis and according to that for the significant\ncontribution of the nonlocal (long-range) Madelung-like\ninteraction to EP I. It turns out that because of the\nionicity of the structure the La and Oz axial modes are\nstrongly coupled with charge carriers in the CuO2 planes\ndespite the fact that the local density of states on these\natoms is very small [150], i.e. N La (0) = 0.13 states/eV\nand N Oz (0) = 0.016 states/eV . For comparison, on\nplanar atoms Cu and Oxy one has N Cu (0) = 0.54\nstates/eV and N Oxy (0) = 0.35 states/eV . These\ncalculations show that the lanthanum mode (with\n\u03c9q,\u03bd = 202 cm\u22121 ) at the q = (0, 0.2\u03c0/c) zone boundary\n(fully symmetric Z-point) has ten times larger coupling\nconstant \u03bbLa\nq,\u03bd (F IP ) = 4.8 than it is predicted in the\nRM T approximation \u03bbLa\nq,\u03bd (RM T ) = 0.48. The similar\nincrease holds for the average coupling constant, where\nLa\n\u03bbLa\n\u03bd,average (F IP ) = 1.0 but \u03bb\u03bd,average (RM T ) = 0.1.\nNote, that for the q \u2248 0 La-mode one obtains\nLa\n\u03bbLa\n\u03bd (F IP ) = 4.54 compared to \u03bb\u03bd (RM T ) = 0.12. Similar results hold for the axial apex-oxygen q = (0, 0.2\u03c0/c)\nmode (Oz ) with \u03c9 q,\u03bd = 396 cm\u22121 where the large\n(compared to the RM T method) coupling constant\nOz\nz\nis obtained: \u03bbO\nq,\u03bd = 14 and \u03bb\u03bd,average = 4.7, while\n\n\f43\nfor q \u2248 0 axial apex-oxygen modes with \u03c9 q,\u03bd = 415\nz\ncm\u22121 one has \u03bbO\nAfter averaging\n\u03bd,average = 11.7.\nover all calculated modes it was estimated \u03bb = 1.37\nand \u03c9log \u2248 400 K. By assuming that \u03bc\u2217 = 0.1 one\nobtains Tc = 49 K by using Allen-Dynes formula for\nTc \u2248 0.83\u03c9logR exp{\u22121.04(1 + \u03bb)/[\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 (1 + 0.62\u03bb)]}\nwith \u03c9 log = 2 d\u03c9d\u03c9\u03b12 (\u03c9)F (\u03c9) ln \u03c9/\u03bb\u03c9. For \u03bc\u2217 = 0.15\nand 0.2 one obtains Tc = 41 and 32 K, respectively.\nWe stress that the rather large \u03bbep (and Tc ) are due to\nthe nonlocal (long range) effects of the metallic-ionic\nstructure of HTSC cuprates and non-muffin-tin corrections in EPI, as was first proposed in [155]. However, we\nwould like to stress that the optimistic results for \u03bbep\nobtained in [150] is in fact based on the calculation of the\nEPI coupling for some wave vectors q with symmetric\nvibration patterns and in fact the obtained \u03bbep is an\nextrapolated value. The all-q calculations of \u03bbep,q which\ntake into account long-range effects is a real challenge\nfor the LDA-DFT calculations and are still awaiting.\nFinally, it is worth to mention important calculations\nof the EPI coupling constant in the framework of the\nlinear-response full-potential linear-muffin-tin-orbital\nmethod (LRF P \u2212 LM T O) invented in [156] and applied\nto the doped HT SC cuprate (Ca1\u2212x Srx )1\u2212y CuO2 for\nx \u223c 0.7 and y \u223c 0.1 with Tc = 110 K [157]. Namely,\nthese calculations give strong evidence that structural\nproperties of HTSC cuprates already alone make the\ndominance of small-q scattering in EPI, which effect\nis additionally increased by strong correlations. In\norder to analyze this compound in [157] calculations\nare performed for CaCuO2 doped by holes in an\nuniform, neutralizing back-ground charge. The momentum (q = (qk , q\u22a5 )) dependent EPI coupling constant\n(summed over all phonon branches \u03bd) in different L channels (s, p, d..) is calculated by using a standard expression\n\n\u03bbL (q) = M\n\nX\nk,\u03bd\n\n2\n\nYL (k + q) |gk,q,\u03bd | YL (k) \u00d7 \u03b4(\u03be k+q )\u03b4(\u03be k )\n\n(71)\nHere, \u03be k is the quasi-particle energy, gk,q,\u03bd is the EPI\ncoupling constant (matrix element) with the \u03bd-th branch,\nYL (k) is the L-channel wave function and the normaliza\u22121\ntion factor M\nP\u221d N2L (0) with the partial density of states\nis NL (0) \u221d k YL (k)\u03b4(\u03be k ). The total coupling constant\nin the L-channel is an average of \u03bbL (q) over the whole\n2D Brillouin zone (over qk ), i.e. \u03bbL (q\u22a5 ) = \u03bbL (qk ) BZ .\nWe stress three important results of Ref. [157]. First,\nthe s- and d-coupling constants, \u03bbs (q), \u03bbd (q), are peaked\nat small transfer momenta q \u223c(\u03c0/3a, 0, 0) as it is shown\nin Fig. 3 of Ref. [157]. This result is mainly caused by\nthe nesting properties of the Fermi surface shown in Fig.\n1 of Ref. [157]. Second, the q-dependence of the inte2\n\"\ngrated EPI\nPmatrix elements |\u1e21L,q | = \u03bbL (q)/\u03c7L (q) (with\n\"\n\u03c7L (q) \u221d k YL (k + q)YL (k)\u03b4(\u03be k+q )\u03b4(\u03be k )) for L = s, d\nis similar to that of \u03bbL (q), i.e. these are peaked at\nsmall transfer momenta q \u226a 2kF . Both these results\nmean that the structural properties of HTSC cuprates\n\nimply the dominance of small-q EPI scattering. Third,\nthe calculations give similar values for \u03bbs (q\u22a5 = 0) and\n\u03bbd (q\u22a5 = 0), i.e. \u03bbs = 0.47 for s \u2212 wave and \u03bbd = 0.36\nfor d \u2212 wave pairing [157]. This finding (that \u03bbd \u2248 \u03bbs )\nis due to the dominance of the small q-scattering in EPI.\nIt means that the nonlocal effects (long range forces) in\nEPI of HTSC cuprates are very important. This result\ntogether with the finding of the dominance of small-q\nscattering in EPI due to strong correlations [51], [96],\n[97] mean that strong correlations and structural properties of HTSC cuprates make EPI conform with d-wave\npairing, either as its main cause or as its supporter. We\nstress that the obtained coupling constant \u03bbd = 0.36 is\nrather small to give d-wave pairing with large Tc and on\nthe first glance this result is against the EPI mechanism\nof pairing in cuprates. However, it is argued throughout\nthis paper, that the LDA methods applied to strongly\ncorrelated systems overestimate the screening effects and\nunderestimate the coupling constant and therefore their\nquantitative predictions are not reliable.\nVII.\n\nEPI AND STRONG CORRELATIONS IN\nCUPRATES\nA.\n\nMinimal model Hamiltonian\n\nThe minimal microscopic model for normal and superconducting state of HTSC cuprates must include at\nleast three orbitals: one dx2 \u2212y2 -orbital of the Cu-ion and\ntwo p-orbitals (px,y ) of the O-ion since they participate\nin transport properties of these materials - see more in\n[3] and References therein. The electronic part of the\nHamiltonian (of the minimal model) is \u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124int\n- usually called the Emery model [158], where the one\nparticle tight-binding Hamiltonian \u01240 describes kinetic\nenergy in the three-band (orbital) model\nX\nX\n(\u01eb0p\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bc)p\u2020j\u03b1\u03c3 pj\u03b1\u03c3\n(\u01eb0d \u2212 \u03bc)d\u2020i\u03c3 di\u03c3 +\n\u01240 =\ni,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\ni,j,\u03b1,\u03c3\n\n\u2020\ntpd\nij\u03b1 di\u03c3 pj\u03b1\u03c3 +\n\nj,\u03b1,\u03c3.\n\nX\n\n\u2020\ntpp\njj \u2032 ,\u03b1\u03b2 pj\u03b1\u03c3 pj \u2032 \u03b2\u03c3\n\n(72)\n\nj,j \u2032 ,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c3\n\nHere tpd\nij\u03b1 (i, j enumerate Cu- and O-sites, respectively)\nis the hopping integral between the p\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y)- and d0\nstates and tpp\njj \u2032 \u03b1\u03b2 between p\u03b1 - and p\u03b2 -states, while \u01ebd and\n\u01eb0p\u03b1 are the bare d- and p- local energy levels and \u03bc is\nthe chemical potential. This tight-binding Hamiltonian\nis written in the electronic notation where the chargetransfer energy \u2206dp,0 \u2261 \u01eb0d \u2212 \u01eb0p > 0 by assuming that\nthere is one 3dx2 \u2212y2 electron on the copper (Cu2+ ) while\nelectrons in the p-levels of the O2\u2212 ions occupy filled\nbands. \u01240 contains the main ingredients coming from\nthe comparison with the LDA \u2212 DF T band structure\ncalculations. The LDA\u2212 DF T results are reproduced by\nassuming tpp \u226a tpd (and \u01eb0p\u03b1 = \u01eb0p ) where the good fit to\n\n\f44\n0\nthe LDA\u2212DF T band structure\n\u221a is found for \u2206dp,0 \u2261 \u01ebd \u2212\n0\npd\n\u01ebp \u2248 3.2 eV and t (\u2261 tpd ) = ( 3/2)(pd\u03c3), (pd\u03c3) = \u22121.8\n\u221a\neV . The total LDA band-width Wb = (4 2) | tpd |\u223c\n=9\neV [159].\nThe electron interaction is described by \u0124int\nX p\nX\nnj\u03b1\u2191 npj\u03b1\u2193 + V\u0302c + V\u0302ep , (73)\nndi\u2191 ndi\u2193 + Up\n\u0124int = Ud\ni\n\nj,\u03b1\n\nwhere Ud and Up are the on-site Coulomb repulsion energies at Cu and O sites, respectively while V\u0302c and V\u0302ep\ndescribe the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction\nof electrons (holes) and EP I, respectively. Note, the\nHubbard repulsion Ud on the Cu-ion is different from its\nbare atomic value Ud0 (\u2248 16 eV for Cu) due to various\nkind of screening effects in solids [160]. In turns out that\nin most transition metal oxides one has Ud \u226a Ud0 . This\nproblem is thoroughly studied in [160] and applied to\nHTSC cuprates. An estimation from numerical cluster\ncalculations [161] gives Ud = 9 \u2212 11 eV and Up = 4 \u2212 6\neV but because ndi Ud \u226b npj Up the on-site repulsion on\noxygen is usually neglected at the first stage of the analysis.\nNote, that in the case of large Ud (\u226b tpd , \u2206dp,0 ) the hole\nnotation is usually used where in the parent compound\n(and for |tpd | \u226a \u2206dp,0 ) one has hndi i = 1, i.e. one hole in\nthe 3d-shall (in the 3dx2 \u2212y2 state) in the ground state.\nIn the limit of large Ud \u2192 \u221e the doubly occupancy on\nthe Cu atoms is forbidden and only two copper states are\npossible: Cu2+ described by the quantum state d\u2020i\u03c3 | 0i\nand Cu1+ described by | 0i. In this (hole) notation the\noxygen p-level is fully occupied by electrons, i.e. there is\nno holes ( hnpj i = 0) in the occupied oxygen 2p-shall of\nO2\u2212 . In this notation the vacuum state | 0v i (not the\nground state) of the Hamiltonian \u0124 for large Ud corresponds to the closed shell configuration Cu1+ O2\u2212 . In\nthe hole notation the hole p-level \u01eb0ph lies higher than the\nhole d-level \u01eb0dh , i.e. \u2206pd,0 \u2261 \u01eb0ph \u2212 \u01eb0dh > 0 (note in the\nelectron picture it is opposite) and Ud means repulsion of\ntwo holes (in the 3dx2 \u2212y2 orbital ) with opposite spins 3d8 configuration of the Cu3+ ion. Note, that \u01eb0ph = \u2212\u01eb0p ,\n\u01eb0dh = \u2212\u01eb0d and tpd,h = \u2212tpd . In the following the index\nh in tpd,h is omitted. The reason for \u01eb0ph > \u01eb0dh is partly\nin different energies for the hole sitting on the oxygen\nand copper, respectively [159]. From this model one can\nderive in the limit U \u2192 \u221e the t\u2212J model for the 2D lattice in the CuO2 plane [162], [163], where each lattice site\ncorresponds to a Cu-atom. In the presence of one hole in\nthe 3d-shall then in the undoped (no oxygen holes) HTSC\ncuprate each lattice site is occupied by one hole. By doping the systems with holes the additional holes go onto\nO-sites. Furthermore, due to the strong Cu-O covalent\nbinding the energetics of the system implies that an Ohole forms a Zhang-Rice singlet with a Cu-hole [162]. In\nthe t \u2212 J model the Zhang-Rice singlet is described by an\nempty site. Since in the t\u2212J model the doubly occupancy\nis forbidden one introduces annihilation (Hubbard) operator of the composite fermion X\u0302i\u03c30 = c\u2020i\u03c3 (1\u2212ni,\u2212\u03c3 ) which\n\ndescribes creation of an hole (in the 3d-shall of the Cuatoms) on the i-th site if this site is previously empty\n(thus excluding doubly occupancy) , i.e. ni,\u03c3 + ni,\u2212\u03c3 \u2264 1\nmust be fulfilled on each lattice site. In this picture the\ndoped hole concentration \u03b4 means at the same time the\nconcentration of the oxygen holes and of the Zhang-Rice\nsinglets.\nThe bosonic-like operators X\u0302i\u03c31 \u03c32 = X\u0302i\u03c31 0 X\u0302i0\u03c32 , \u03c3 1 6=\n\u03c3 2 create a spin fluctuation for \u03c3 1 6= \u03c3 2 at the i \u2212 th site\nand the spin operator is given by S = X\u0302i\u03c3\u03041 0 (~\u03c3 )\u03c3\u0304 1 \u03c3\u03042 X\u0302i0\u03c3\u03042\nwhere summation\nover bar indices is understood. The\nP\noperator \u03c3 X\u0302i\u03c3\u03c3 has the meaning of the hole number\non the i-th site. It is useful to introduce the operator\nX\u0302i00 = X\u0302i0\u03c3 X\u0302i\u03c30 at a given lattice site which is the number\nof Zhang-Rice singlets on the i-th site, i.e. if X\u0302i00 | 0i =\n1 | 0i the i-th site is occupied by the Zhang-Rice singlet,\nwhile for X\u0302i00 | 1i = 0 | 1i there is no Zhang-Rice singlet\non the i-th site (i.e. this site is occupied only by one\n3d9 hole on the Cu site). The latter is due to the local\nconstraint\nX\nX\u0302i00 +\nX\u0302i\u03c3\u03c3 = 1,\n(74)\n\u03c3=\u2191\u2193\n\nwhich forbids doubly occupancy of the i-th site by holes.\nBy projecting out doubly occupied (high energy) states\nthe t \u2212 J model reads\nX\nX\ntij X\u0302i\u03c30 X\u0302j0\u03c3\n\u01eb0i X\u0302i\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212\n\u0124t\u2212j =\ni,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\ni,j\n\ni,j,\u03c3\n\n1\nJij (Si * Sj \u2212 n\u0302i n\u0302j ) + \u01243 .\n4\n\n(75)\n\nThe first term (\u223c \u01eb0i ) describes an effective local energy\nof the hole (or the Zhang-Rice singlet), the second one\n(\u223c tij ) describes hopping of the holes, the third one\n(\u223c Jij ) is the Heisenberg-like exchange energy between\ntwo holes. The theory [162] predicts that \u01eb0i \u226b |tij |.\nThis property is very important in the study of EPI. \u01243\ncontains three-sites term which is usually omitted believing it is not important. For charge fluctuation processes\nit is plausible to omit it, while for spin-fluctuation processes it is questionable approximation. If one introduces\nthe enumeration \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bb = 0, \u2191, \u2193 than the Hubbard operators satisfy the following algebra\ni\nh\nh\ni\n(76)\nX\u0302i\u03b1\u03b2 , X\u0302j\u03b3\u03bb = \u03b4 ij \u03b4 \u03b3\u03b2 X\u0302i\u03b1\u03bb \u00b1 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03bb X\u0302i\u03b3\u03b2 ,\n\u00b1\n\nwhere \u03b4 ij is the Kronecker symbol.\nThe\n(anti)commutation relations in Eq.(76) are more\ncomplicated than the canonical Fermi and Bose\n(anti)commutation relations which complicates the\nmathematical structure of the theory. Note, that the\nHubbard operators possess also projection properties\nwith X\u0302i\u03b1\u03b2 X\u0302i\u03b3\u03bb = \u03b4 \u03b2\u03b3 X\u0302i\u03b1\u03bb . To escape these complications\nsome novel techniques have been used, such as the\n\n\f45\nslave boson technique. In this technique X\u0302i0\u03c3 = fi\u03c3 b\u2020i ,\n\u2020\nare represented in terms of the fermion\nX\u0302i\u03c31 \u03c3 2 = fi\u03c3\nf\n1 i\u03c3 2\n(spinon) operator fi\u03c3 which annihilates the spin of the\nhole and the boson (holon) operator b\u2020i which creates\nthe Zhang-Rise singlet.\nIn the minimal theoretical model the electron-phonon\ninteraction (EPI) contains in principle two leading terms\nion\ncov\nion\n\u0124ep = \u0124ep\n+ \u0124ep\n, the \"ionic\" one (\u0124ep\n) and the \"covacov\nlent\" one (\u0124ep ). The \"ionic\"term describes the change\nof the energy of the hole (or the Zhang-Rice singlet) at\nthe i-th site due to lattice vibrations and it reads [3], [51],\n[96]\nion\n\u0124ep\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u0302i X\u0302i\u03c3\u03c3 ,\n\n(77)\n\ni,\u03c3\n\nP\n0\nwhere the \"displacement\" operator \u03a6\u0302i =\nL\u03ba [\u01eb(Ri \u2212\n0\n0\n0\nRL\u03ba + \u00fbi \u2212 \u00fbL\u03ba ) \u2212 \u01eb(Ri \u2212 RL\u03ba )] (which as in Section V\nincludes the bare coupling constant) describes the change\nof the hole (or Zhang-Rice singlet) energy \u01eb0a,i by displacing atoms in the lattice by the vector \u00fbL\u03ba . In the\nharmonic approximation the EPI potential is given by\nP\n\u03a6\u0302i =\ngi (q, \u03bb) exp{iqRi }[bq,\u03bb + b\u2020\u2212q,\u03bb ] where bq,\u03bb and\nb\u2020q,\u03bb are annihilation and creation operators of phonons\nwith the polarization \u03bb, respectively. This term describes\nin principle the following processes: (1) the change of the\nO-hole and Cu-hole bare energies \u01eb0ph , \u01eb0dh in the three\u2013\nband model due to lattice vibrations; (2) the change of\nthe long-range Madelung energy (which is due to the ionicity of the structure) by lattice vibrations along the caxis; (3) the change of the Cu \u2212 O hopping parameter tpd\nin the presence of vibrations, etc. Here, L and \u03ba enumerate unit lattice vectors and atoms in the unit cell, respectively. Until now the phonon operator \u03a6\u0302i is calculated\nin the harmonic approximation for the EPI interaction\nof holes with some specific phononic modes, such as the\nbreathing and half-breathing ones [6], [133]. The theory\nwhich includes also all other (than oxygen) vibrations in\n\u03a6\u0302i is still awaiting.\nIt is interesting to make comparison of the EPI coupling constants in the t\u2212J model and in the Hartree-Fock\n(HF) approximation (which is the analogous of the LDADFT method) of the three-band model in Eqs.(72-73)\nwhen the problem is projected on the single band. For\ninstance, the coupling constant with the half-breathing\nmode at the zone boundary in HF approximation (which\nmimics LDA-DFT) is given by\nHF\nghb\n= \u00b14tpd\n\n1\n\u2202tpd\nu0 ,\n\u2202RCu\u2212O \u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebp\n\n(78)\n\nt\u2212J\nwhile the coupling constant in the t-J model ghb\n(=\n0\n\u2202\u01eb /\u2202RCu\u2212O ) is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n\u2202tpd\n2p2\n2p \u2212 1\nt\u2212J\nu0 ,\nghb\n= \u00b14tpd\n+\n\u2202RCu\u2212O \u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebp\nUd \u2212 |\u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebp |\n(79)\n\nwhere p = 0.96 - see [6], [133] and references therein. It\nis obvious that in the t \u2212 J model the electron-phonon\ncoupling is different from the HF one, since the former\ncontains an additional term coming from the many body\neffects, which are not comprised by the HF (LDA-DFT)\ncalculations. The first term in Eq. (79) describes the\nhopping of a 3d-hole into the O 2p-states and this term\nexists also in the LDA-DFT coupling constant - see Eq.\n(78). However, the second term in Eq. (79), which is due\nto many body effects, describes the hopping of a O 2phole into the (already) single occupied Cu 3d-state and it\ndoes not exist in the LDA-DFT approach. Since the corresponding dimensionless coupling constant \u03bbhb is pro2\nportional to |ghb | one obtains that the bare t-J coupling\nconstant is almost three times larger than the LDA-DFT\none \u03bbt\u2212J\n\u2248 3\u03bbHF\nhb . This example demonstrates clearly\nhb\nthat LDA-DFT method is unreliable for calculating the\nEPI coupling constant in HTSC cuprates.\nNote, that there is also a covalent contribution to EP I\nwhich comes from the change of the effective hopping (t)\nin the t \u2212 J model Eq.(75) and the exchange energy (J)\nin the presence of atomic displacements\nX\n\u2202tij\ncov\n\u03c30 0\u03c3\n\u0124ep\n=\u2212\n0 \u2212 R0 ) (\u00fbi \u2212 \u00fbj )X\u0302i X\u0302j +\n\u2202(R\nj\ni\ni,j,\u03c3\n+\n\nX\ni,j,\n\n\u2202Jij\n(\u00fbi \u2212 \u00fbj )Si * Sj .\n\u2202(R0i \u2212 R0j )\n\n(80)\n\nHere, we shall not go into details but only stress that\nsince \u01eb0i \u226b |tij | then the covalent term in the effective tJ model is much smaller than the ionic term - see more in\n[3], [6], [133] and References therein, and in the following\nion\nwill be considered [3], [51], [96].\nonly the term \u0124ep\nB.\n\nControllable X-method for the quasi-particle\ndynamics\n\nThe minimal model Hamiltonian for strongly correlated holes with EPI (discussed above) is expressed via\nthe Hubbard operators which obey \"ugly\" non-canonical\ncommutation relations. The latter property is rather\nunpleasant for making a controllable theory in terms\nof Feynmann diagrams (for these \"ugly\" operators) and\nsome other approaches are required. There is one very\nefficient and mathematically controllable approach for\ntreating the problem with Hubbard operators without\nusing slave boson (or fermion) techniques. The method\n(we call it the X-method ) is based on the general BaymKadanoff technique where the 1/N expansion for the\nGreen's functions in terms of Hubbard operators was\nfirst introduced in [164] and refined in [51], [96]. In the\nparamagnetic and homogeneous state (with finite doping) the Green's function G\u03c3 1 \u03c3 2 (1 \u2212 2) is diagonal, i.e.\nG\u03c3 1 \u03c3 2 (1 \u2212 2) = \u03b4 \u03c31 \u03c32 G(1 \u2212 2) where\nD\nE\nG(1 \u2212 2) = \u2212 T X\u0302 0\u03c3 (1)X\u0302 \u03c30 (2) = g(1 \u2212 2)Q, (81)\n\n\f46\nD\nE\nwith the Hubbard spectral weight Q = hX\u0302 00 i + X\u0302 \u03c3\u03c3 .\n\nThe function g(1 \u2212 2) plays the role of the quasi-particle\nGreen's function - see more in [3], [51], [96], [97]. It turns\nout, that in order to have a controllable theory (1/N\nexpansion) one way is to increase the number of spin\ncomponents from two to N by changing the constraint\nEq.(74) into the new one\nX\u0302i00 +\n\nN\nX\n\nX\u0302i\u03c3\u03c3 =\n\n\u03c3=1\n\nN\n.\n2\n\n(82)\n\nIn order to reach convergence of physical quantities in the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e the hopping and exchange energy are also\nre-scaled, i.e. tij = t0,ij /N and Jij = J0,ij /N . In order\nto eliminate a possible misunderstanding we stress one\nimportant fact, that in the case N > 2 the constraint in\nEq.(82) spoils some projection properties of the Hubbard\noperators. Fortunately, these (lost) projection properties\nare not used at all in the refined theory. As the result one\nobtains the functional integral equation for G(1, 2), thus\nallowing unambiguous mathematical and physical treatment of the problem. In [51], [96], [97] it is developed a\nsystematic 1/N expansion for the quasi-particle Green's\nfunction g(1 \u2212 2)(= g0 + g1 /N + ...), Q(= N q0 + q1 + ...)\n(also for G(1\u22122)) and the self-energy. For large N (\u2192 \u221e)\nthe leading term is G0 (1 \u2212 2)D = O(N\nE ) = g0 (1 \u2212 2)Q0\n00\n= N \u03b4/2. Here, \u03b4\nwith g0 = O(1) and Q0 = X\u0302i\nis the concentration of the oxygen holes (i.e. of the\nZhang-Rice singlets) which is related to\nP the chemical\npotential by the equation 1 \u2212 \u03b4 = 2 p nF (p) with\n\u0001\u22121\nnF (p) = e\u01eb0 (k)\u2212\u03bc + 1\n. The quasi-particle Green's\nfunction g0 (k, \u03c9) and quasi-particle spectrum \u01eb0 (k) in the\nleading order are given by\ng0 (k, \u03c9) \u2261\n\nG0 (k, \u03c9)\n1\n=\n,\nQ0\n\u03c9 \u2212 [\u01eb0 (k) \u2212 \u03bc]\n\n\u01eb0 (k) = \u01ebc \u2212 \u03b4 * t(k) \u2212\n\nX\n\nJ0 (k + p)nF (p).\n\n(83)\n\n(84)\n\np\n\nP\nThe level shift is \u01ebc = \u01eb0 +2 p t(p)nF (p) and t(p) is the\nFourier transform of the hopping integral tij - see more\nin [3].\nLet us summarize the main results of the X-method\nin leading O(1)-order for the quasi-particle properties in\nthe t-J model [3], [51], [96], [97]: (i) The Green's function\ng0 (k, \u03c9) describes the coherent motion of quasi-particles\nwhose contribution to the total spectral weight of the\nGreen's function G0 (k, \u03c9) is Q0 = N \u03b4/2. The coherent\nmotion of quasi-particles is described in leading order by\nG0 (k, \u03c9) = Q0 g0 (k, \u03c9) and the quasi-particle residuum\nQ0 disappears in the undoped Mott insulating state (\u03b4 =\n0). This result is physically plausible since in the Mott\ninsulating state the coherent motion of quasi-particles,\nwhich is responsible for finite conductivity, vanishes; (ii)\nThe quasi-particle spectrum \u01eb0 (k) plays the same role as\n\nthe eigenvalues of the ideal band structure Hamiltonian\n\u01250 (x, y) (it contains the excitation potential VIBS (x, y)\nwhich includes high-energy processes due to the Coulomb\ninteraction). So, if we would consider \u01ebtb (k) = \u2212t(k)\nas the tight-binding parametrization of the LDA-DFT\nband-structure spectrum which takes int account only\nweak correlations (with the local potential Vxc (x)\u03b4(x \u2212\ny)) then one can define a non-local excitation potential\ntJ\ntJ\nVIBS\n(x, y) = \u1e7cIBS\n(x, y) + Vxc (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 y) which mimics\nstrong correlations in the t-J model\ntJ\n \u0303 \u2212 y).\n\u1e7cIBS\n(x, y) \u2248 V0 \u03b4(x \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)t(x \u2212 y) \u2212 J(x\n(85)\nP\nHere, V0 = 2 p t(p)nF (p) and t(x \u2212 y) is the Fourier\n \u0303 \u2212 y) is the Fourier transtransform of t(k) while J(x\nform of the third term in Eq.(84). The relative excitJ\ntation potential \u1e7cIBS\n(x, y) is due to strong correlations\n(suppression of doubly occupancy on each lattice site)\nand as we shall see below it is responsible for the screening of EPI in such a way that the forward scattering\npeak appears in the effective EPI interaction - see discussion below. (iii) For very low doping \u01eb0 (k) is dominated by the exchange parameter if J0 > \u03b4t0 . However, in the case when J0 \u226a \u03b4t0 there is a band narrowing by lowering the hole doping \u03b4, where the band\nwidth is proportional to the hole concentration \u03b4, i.e.\nWb = z * \u03b4 * t0 ; (iv) The O(1)-order quasi-particle Green's\nfunction g0 (k, \u03c9) and the quasi-particle spectrum \u01eb0 (k)\nin the X-method have similar form as the spinon Green's\nfunction g0,f (k, \u03c9) = \u2212hT f\u03c3 f\u03c3\u2020 ik,\u03c9 and the spinon energy \u01ebs (k) in the SB-method. However, in the SB\nmethod there is a broken gauge symmetry in metallic\nstate which is characterized by hb\u0302i i 6= 0. This broken\nlocal gauge symmetry in the slave-boson method in O(1)\norder, which is due to the local decoupling of spinon and\nholon is in fact forbidden by to the Elitzur's theorem. On\nthe other side the local gauge invariance is not broken in\nthe X-method where the Green's function G0 (k, \u03c9) describes motion of the composite object, i.e. simultaneous\ncreation of the hole and annihilation of the spin at a given\nlattice site, while in the SB theory there is a spin-charge\nseparation because of the broken symmetry (hb\u0302i i 6= 0).\nThe assumption of the broken symmetry hb\u0302i i 6= 0 gives\nqualitative satisfactory results for quasi-particle energy\nfor the case N = \u221e in D > 2 dimensions. However,\nthe analysis of response functions of the system and of\nhigher order 1/N corrections to the self-energy in the\nSB theory is very delicate and special techniques must\nbe implemented in order to restore the gauge invariance\nof the theory. On the other side the X -method is intrinsically gauge invariant and free of spurious effects in\nall orders of the 1/N expansion. Therefore, one expects\nthat these two methods may deliver different results in\nO(1) order in response function. This difference is already manifested in the calculation of EPI where charge\nvertices are peaked at different wave vectors q, i.e. at\nq = 0 in the X-method and q 6= 0 in the SB method see Subsection E; (v) In the important paper [165] it is\n\n\f47\nshown that in the superconducting state the anomalous\nself-energies (which are of O(1/N )-order in the 1/N expansion) of the X- and SB-methods differ substantially.\nAs a consequence, the SB-method [166] predicts false\nsuperconductivity in the t \u2212 J model (for J = 0) with\nlarge Tc (due to the kinematical interaction), while the\nX-method gives extremely small Tc (\u2248 0) [165]. So, although the two approaches yield some similar results in\nleading O(1)-order they are different at least in the next\nleading O(1/N )-order.\nC.\n\nEPI effective potential in the t-J model\n\nThe theory of EPI in the minimal t \u2212 J model based\non the X-method predicts that leading term in the EPI\nself-energy \u03a3ep is given by the expression [3], [51], [96]\n\u03a3ep (1, 2) = \u2212Vep (1\u0304 \u2212 2\u0304)\u03b3 c (1, 3\u0304; 1\u0304)g0 (3\u0304 \u2212 4\u0304)\u03b3 c (4\u0304, 2; 2\u0304),\n(86)\nwhere the screened (by the dielectric constant) EPI po\u22121\n0\ntential Vep (1 \u2212 2) = \u03b5\u22121\ne (1 \u2212 1\u0304)Vep (1\u0304 \u2212 2\u0304)\u03b5e (2\u0304 \u2212 2) and\n0\nVep (1 \u2212 2) = \u2212hT \u03a6\u0302(1)\u03a6\u0302(2)i is the \"phonon\" propagator which may also describe an anharmonic EPI. It is\nobvious that Eq.(86) is equivalent to Eq.(50) in spite\nthe fact that the theory is formulated in terms of the\nHubbard operators. The charge vertex \u03b3 c (1, 2; 3) =\n\u2212\u03b4g0\u22121 (1, 2)/\u03b4uef f (3) corresponds to the the renormalized vertex \u0393c,r in Eq.(50) and it describes the \"screening\" by strong correlations. It depends on the relative\ntJ\nexcitation potential \u1e7cIBS\n(x, y). The electronic dielectric function \u03b5e (1 \u2212 2) describes screening of EPI by the\nlong-range part of the Coulomb interaction. Note, that\nin the harmonic approximation \u03a6\u0302(1) contains the bare\n0\nEPI coupling constant gep\nand lattice displacement \u00fb,\n0\ni.e. \u03a6\u0302 \u223c gep \u00fb - see more in [3]. (Note, that in the above\nequations summation and integration over bar indices are\nunderstood.) The self-energy \u03a3ep (k, \u03c9) due to EPI reads\nZ \u221e\n(87)\n\u03a3ep (k, \u03c9) =\nd\u03a9h\u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03a9)ik\u2032 R(\u03c9, \u03a9),\n0\n\nwith R(\u03c9, \u03a9) = \u22122\u03c0i(nB (\u03a9)+1/2)+\u03c8(1/2+i)\u2212\u03c8(1/2\u2212\ni(\u03a9+\u03c9)/2\u03c0T ) where nB (\u03a9) is the Bose distribution function and \u03c8 is di-gamma function. The Eliashberg spectral\nfunction is given by\nX\n\u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) = N (0)\n| g\u03bd (k, k \u2212 k\u2032 ) |2\n\u03bd\n\n\u00d7 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bd (k \u2212 k\u2032 ))\u03b3 2c (k, k \u2212 k\u2032 )\n\n(88)\n\nwhere g\u03bd (k, p) is the EP I coupling constant for the \u03bd-the\nmode, where the renormalization by long-range Coulomb\n0\ninteraction is included, i.e. g\u03bd (k, p) = gep,\u03bd\n(k, p)/\u03b5e (p).\nh...ik denotes Fermi-surface average with respect to the\nmomentum k and N (0) is the density of states renormalized by strong correlations. The effect of strong correlations (in the adiabatic limit) is stipulated in the charge\n\nvertex function \u03b3 c (k, k \u2212 k\u2032 ) which, as we shall see below, changes the properties of Vep (q, \u03a9) drastically compared to weakly correlated systems. In fact the charge\nvertex depends on frequency but in the adiabatic limit\n(\u03c9 ph \u226a W ) and for qvF > \u03c9ph it is practically frequency\n(ad)\nindependent, i.e. \u03b3 c (k, q, \u03c9) \u2248 \u03b3 c (k, q, \u03c9 = 0) where\nthe latter is real quantity. For J = 0 the 1/N expansion gives N (0) = N0 (0)/q0 where q0 = \u03b4/2 in the t \u2212 t\u2032\nmodel. For J 6= 0 the density of states N (0) does not diverge for \u03b4 \u2192 0 where N (0)(\u223c 1/J0 ) > N0 (0). The bare\ndensity of states N0 (0) is calculated in absence of strong\ncorrelations, for instance by the LDA \u2212 DF T scheme.\nDepending on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter \u2206(k, \u03c9) (s\u2212, d\u2212wave pairing) various projected averages (over the Fermi surface) of \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9)\nenter the Eliashberg equations.

This important ingredient (which respects also\nWard identities) is decisive step beyond the MFA renormalization of EPI in strongly correlated systems which\nwas previously studied in connection with heavy fermions\n- see review [167].\n\u039btr =\n\nD.\n\nCharge vertex and the EPI coupling\n\nThe charge vertex function \u03b3 c (k, q) (in the adiabatic\napproximation) has been calculated in [51], [96], [97] in\nthe framework of the 1/N expansion in the X-method see also [3], and here we discuss only the main results.\nNote, that \u03b3 c (k, q) renormalizes all charge fluctuation\nprocesses, such as the EP I interaction, the long range\nCoulomb interaction, nonmagnetic impurity scattering\netc. In fact \u03b3 c (k, q) describes specific screening due to\nthe vanishing of doubly occupancy in strongly correlated\nsystems. Note, the latter constraint is at present impossible to incorporate into the LDA \u2212 DF T band structure\ncalculations, thus making the latter method unreliable\nin highly correlated systems. In [51], [96], [97] \u03b3 c (k, q, \u03c9)\nwas calculated as a function of the model parameters\nt, t\u2032, \u03b4, J in leading O(1) order of the t \u2212 J model\n\u03b3 c (k, q) = 1 \u2212\n\n6 X\n6\nX\n\nF\u03b1 (k)[1\u0302 + \u03c7\u0302(q)]\u22121\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c7\u03b22 (q),\n\n(94)\n\n\u03b1=1 \u03b2=1\n\nP\nF\u03b1 (k)\n=\nwhere \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (q)\n=\np G\u03b1 (p, q)F\u03b2 (p),\n[t(k), 1, 2J0 cos kx , 2J0 sin kx , 2J0 cos ky , 2J0 sin ky ], and\nG\u03b1 (p, q) = [1, t(p + q), cos px , sin px , cos py , sin py ]\u03a0(p, q).\nHere, \u03a0(k, q) = \u2212g(k)g(k + q) and q = (q, iqn ),\nqn = 2\u03c0nT , p = (p, ipm ), pm = \u03c0T (2m + 1). The\nphysical meaning of the vertex function \u03b3 c (k, q) is\nfollowing - in the presence of an external or internal\ncharge perturbation there is a screening due to the\n\nFIG. 36. Adiabatic (\u03c9 = 0) vertex function \u03b3(kF , q) of the\nt-J model as a function of the momentum aq with q = (q, q)\nfor three different doping levels \u03b4. From [96].\n\ntJ\nchange of the excitation potential VIBS\n(x, y), i.e. of\nthe change of the band width, as well as of the local\nchemical potential.\nThe central result is that for\nmomenta k laying at (and near) the Fermi surface the\nvertex function \u03b3 c (k, q, \u03c9 = 0) has very pronounced\nforward scattering peak (at q = 0) at very low doping\nconcentration \u03b4(\u226a 1), while the backward scattering\nis substantially suppressed, as it is seen in Fig. 36\nwhere \u03b3 c (kF , q, \u03c9 = 0) is shown. The peak at q = 0 is\nvery narrow at very small doping since its width qc is\nproportional to doping \u03b4, i.e. qc \u223c \u03b4(\u03c0/a) where a is the\nlattice constant. It is interesting that \u03b3 c (k, q), as well as\nthe dynamics of charge fluctuations, depend only weakly\non the exchange energy J and are mainly dominated by\nthe constraint of having no doubly occupancy of sites,\nas it is shown in [51], [96], [97].\nThe existence of the forward scattering peak in \u03b3 c (k, q)\nat q = 0 is confirmed by numerical calculations in the\nHubbard model, which is very pronounced at large U\n[168]. This is important result since it means that 1/N\nexpansion in the X-method is reliable method in studying charge fluctuation processes in strongly correlated\nsystems. The strong suppression of \u03b3 c (k, q) at large\nq(\u223c kF ) means that the charge fluctuations are strongly\nsuppressed (correlated) at small distances. Such a behavior of the vertex function means that a quasi-particle\nmoving in the strongly correlated medium digs up a giant correlation hole with the radius \u03be ch (\u223c \u03c0/qc ) \u2248 a/\u03b4,\nwhere a is the lattice constant. As a consequence of this\neffect the renormalized EPI becomes long ranged which\nis contrary to the weakly correlated systems where it is\nshort ranged.\nBy knowing \u03b3 c (k, q) one can calculate the relative coupling constants \u039b1 \u2261 \u039bs , \u039b3 \u2261 \u039bd , \u039btr etc. In the absence of correlations and for an isotropic band one has\n\n\f49\ning mode with the frequency \u03c9 br which is supposed to\nbe important in HTSC cuprates. The bare coupling\nconstant (squared) for this mode is approximately given\n2\n0\n0 2\n[sin2 (qx a/2) + sin2 (qy a/2)] which\nby gbr\n(k, q) = gbr\nreaches maximum for large q = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a).

From [97].\n\n\u039b1 = \u039btr = 1, \u039bi = 0 for i > 1. The averages in \u039bs ,\n\u039bd and \u039btr were performed numerically in [96] by using\nthe realistic anisotropic band dispersion in the t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2212 J\nmodel and the results are shown in Fig. 37. For convenience, the three curves are multiplied with a common factor so that \u039bs approaches 1 in the empty-band\nlimit \u03b4 \u2192 1, when strong correlations are absent. Note,\nthat the superconducting critical temperature Tc in the\nweak coupling limit and in the i \u2212 th channel scales like\n(i)\nTc \u223c exp(\u22121/(\u03bb0 \u039bi \u2212 \u03bc\u2217i ) where \u03bb0 is some effective\ncoupling which depends on microscopic details and \u03bc\u2217i is\nthe effective residual Coulomb repulsion in the i-th channel. We stress here several interesting results which come\nout from the theory and can be also extracted with the\nhelp of Figs. 36-37.\n(1) In principle the bare EPI coupling constant\ng\u03bb0 (k, q) depends on the quasi-particle momentum k and\nthe transfer momentum q. In the t \u2212 J model the EPI\nion\ncoupling is dominated by the ionic coupling \u0124ep\n(see\nEq.(77)) and corresponding EPI depends only on the momentum transfer q, i.e. g\u03bb0 (k, q) \u2248 g\u03bb0 (q) while for the\ncov\nmuch smaller covalent coupling \u0124ep\ndepends on both\nk and q [3], [6]. However, the EPI coupling for most\nphonon modes are renormalized by the charge vertex and\nsince the latter is peaked at small momentum transfer\nq = |k \u2212 k\u2032 | one expects that the maxima of the corresponding effective potentials are pushed toward smaller\nvalues of q. This vertex renormalization is important\nresult since if in the absence of strong correlations the\n2\nbare EPI coupling g 0 (k, q) for some phonon modes\n(which enters in the effective t \u2212 J model) is detrimental for d-wave pairing it can be less detrimental or even\nsupports it in the presence of strong correlations. To\nillustrate this let us consider the in-plane oxygen breath-\n\n(96)\n\ngives\nthe\nrepulsive\ncoupling\ncon\u03bb0d in the d-channel, E i.e.\n\u03bb0d\n=\nD\n2\n0\n(2/\u03c9br ) \u03c8 d (k) gbr\n(k \u2212 k\u2032 ) \u03c8 d (k\u2032 ) < 0. However, in\nthe presence of strong correlations one expects that the\neffective coupling constant is given approximately by\n2\nef f\n0\ngbr\n(k, k \u2212 k\u2032 ) \u2248 gbr\n(k \u2212 k\u2032 ) \u03b3 2c (kF , k \u2212 k\u2032 ) which\nis at small doping \u03b4 suppressed substantially at large\nq since \u03b3 2c falls off drastically at q \u223c qc \u223c \u03b4(\u03c0/a). The\nlatter property makes the effective coupling constant\nf\n(in the d-channel) \u03bbef\nd for these modes less negative or\neven positive (depending on the ratio \u03be ch /a \u223c 1/\u03b4), i.e.\nf\none has \u03bbef\n> \u03bb0d . We stress again that this analysis is\nd\nonly qualitative (and semi-quantitative) since it is based\non the t \u2212 J model while the better quantitative results\nare expected in the strongly correlated (Ud \u226b t, \u2206pd )\nthree-band Emery model - see Appendix D in [3].\nUnfortunately, these calculations are not done until now.\n(2) In weakly correlated systems (or for instance in the\nempty-band limit \u03b4 \u2192 1) the relative d \u2212 wave coupling\nconstant \u039bd is much smaller than the s \u2212 wave coupling\nconstant \u039bs , i.e. \u039bd \u226a \u039bs as it is seen in Fig. 37.\nFurthermore, \u039bs decreases with decreasing doping.\n(3) It is indicative that independently on the value\nof t\u2032 6= 0 or t\u2032 = 0 the coupling constant \u039bs and \u039bd\nmeet each other (note \u039bs > \u039bd for all \u03b4) at some small\ndoping \u03b4 \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2 where \u039bs \u2248 \u039bd . We would like\nto stress that such an unique situation (with \u039bs \u2248 \u039bd )\nwas practically never realized in low temperature and\nweakly correlated superconductors and in that respect\nthe strong momentum dependent EPI in HTSC cuprates\nis an exclusive phenomenon.\n(4) By taking into account residual Coulomb repulsion of quasi-particles then the s \u2212 wave superconductivity (which is governed by \u039bs ) is suppressed, while the\nd \u2212 wave superconductivity (which is governed by \u039bd )\nstays almost unaffected, since \u03bc\u2217s \u226b \u03bc\u2217d . In that case the\nd \u2212 wave superconductivity which is mainly governed by\nEP I becomes more stable than the s \u2212 wave one at sufficiently low doping \u03b4. This transition between s- and\nd-wave superconductivity is triggered by electronic correlations because in the model calculations [51], [96] the\nbare EP I coupling is assumed to be momentum independent, i.e. the bare coupling constant contains the\ns \u2212 wave symmetry only.\n\n\f50\n(5) The calculations of the charge vertex \u03b3 c are performed in the adiabatic limit, i.e. for \u03c9 < q * vF (q)\nthe frequency \u03c9 in \u03b3 c can be neglected. In the nonadiabatic regime, i.e. for \u03c9 > q * vF (q), the function\n\u03b3 2c (kF , q,\u03c9) may be substantially larger compared to the\nadiabatic case because \u03b3 c (kF , q,\u03c9) tends to the bare\nvalue 1 for q = 0. This means that EPI for different\nphonons (with different energies \u03c9) is differently affected\nby strong correlations. For a given \u03c9 the EPI coupling\nto those phonons with momenta q < q\u03c9 = \u03c9/vF will\nbe (relatively) enhanced since \u03b3 c (kF , q,\u03c9) \u22481, while the\ncoupling to those with q > q\u03c9 = \u03c9/vF will be substantially reduced due to the suppression of the backward\nscattering by strong correlations [23]. These results are\na consequence of the Ward identities and generally hold\nin the Landau-Fermi liquid theory [169].\n(6) The transport EPI coupling constant \u039btr is significantly reduced in the presence of strong correlations\nespecially for low doping where \u039btr < \u039b/3. This mathematical result is physically plausible since the resistivity\nis dominated by the backward scattering processes (large\nq \u223c kF ) which are suppressed by strong correlations - the\nsuppression of \u03b3 c (kF , q,\u03c9) at large q.\nThe theory based on the forward scattering peak in\nEPI is a good candidate to explain the linear temperature behavior of the resistivity down to very small temperatures T (\u223c \u0398D /30) \u2248 10 K in some cuprates with\nlow Tc (\u2248 10 K) [3], [93] [94]. A physically rather plausible model (based on the forward scattering peak in EPI)\nis elaborated in [93]. It takes into account: (i) the quasiparticle scattering on acoustic (a) optic (o) phonons; (ii)\nthe extended van Hove singularity in the quasi-particle\ndensity of states N (\u03be) which in some cuprates is very near\nthe Fermi surface; (iii) umklapp and \"undulation\" (due\nto the flat regions at the Fermi surface) processes with\nvk\u2032 \u223c\n= \u2212 vk - this condition can partly increase the EPI\ncoupling. The transport Eliashberg function \u03b12tr F (\u03c9)\nis calculated similary to Eq.(91) by using the definition\nof \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) in Eq.(89) with the renormalized cou(r)\npling constant g\u03bd (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) = g\u03bd (k \u2212 k\u2032 )\u03b3 c (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) of the\n\u03bd = a, o mode, respectively. The phenomenological form\nfor the forward scattering peak in \u03b3 c (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) with the\ncut-off qc \u226a kF (and which mimics the exact results\nfrom [51], [96], [97]) can be found in [93]. Since the scattering of the quasi-particles on phonons (with the sound\nvelocity vs ) is limited to small-q transfer processes (with\nq < qc ) then the maximal energy of the acoustic branch is\nnot the Debye energy \u0398D (\u2248 kF vs ) but the effective Debye energy \u0398A (\u2248 qc vs ) \u226a \u0398D . In the case of Bi \u2212 2201\nin [93] it is taken (from the numerical results in [51], [96],\n[97]) that qc \u2248 kF /10 which gives \u0398A \u2248 (30 \u2212 50) K. As\nthe result the calculated \u03b12tr F (\u03c9) gives that \u03c1ab (T ) \u223c T\ndown to very low T (\u223c 0.2 \u0398A ) \u2248 10 K. The slope\n(d\u03c1ab /dT ) is governed by the effective EPI coupling constant for acoustic phonons. In systems with the extended\nvan-Hove singularity (in N (\u03be)) near the Fermi surface,\nwhat is the case in Bi-2201, the effective coupling constant for acoustic phonons can be sufficiently large to give\n\nexperimental values for the slope (d\u03c1ab /dT ) \u223c (0.5 \u2212 1)\n\u03bc\u03a9cm/K - for details see [93]. This physical picture is\napplicable also to cuprates near and at the optimal doping but since in these systems Tc is large the linearity of\n\u03c1ab (T ) down to very low T is \"screened\" by the appearance of superconductivity.\n(7) The forward scattering peak in the charge vertex\n\u03b3 c (kF , q) with the width qc \u223c \u03b4(\u03c0/a) is very narrow in\nunderdoped cuprates which may have further interesting\nconsequences. For instance, HTSC cuprates are characterized not only by strong correlations but also by relatively small Fermi energy EF , which is in underdoped\nsystems not much larger than the characteristic (maximal) phonon frequency \u03c9 max\nph , i.e. EF \u2243 0.1 \u2212 0.3 eV ,\n\u03c9max\n\u2243\n80\nmeV\n.\nDue\nto\nthe appreciable magnitude of\nph\n\u03c9D /EF in HTSC oxides it is necessary to correct the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory by the non-Migdal vertex corrections due to the EPI. It is well-known that these vertex corrections lower Tc in systems with isotropic EPI.\nHowever, the non-Migdal vertex corrections in systems\nwith the forward scattering peak in the EPI coupling\nwith the cut-off qc << kF may increase Tc which can\nbe appreciable. The corresponding calculations [170]\ngive two interesting results: (i) there is a drastic increase of Tc by lowering Qc = qc /2kF , for instance\nTc (Qc = 0.1) \u2248 4Tc(Qc = 1); (ii) Even small values of\n\u03bbep < 1 can give large Tc . The latter results open a new\npossibility in reaching high Tc in systems with appreciable ratio \u03c9D /EF and with the forward scattering peak.\nThe difference between the Migdal-Eliashberg and the\nnon-Migdal theory can be explained qualitatively in the\nframework of an approximative McMillan formula for Tc\n\u2217\n(for not too large \u03bb) which reads Tc \u2248 h\u03c9ie\u22121/[\u03bb\u0303\u2212\u03bc ] . The\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory predicts \u03bb\u0303 \u2248 \u03bb/(1+\u03bb) while the\nnon-Migdal theory [170] gives \u03bb\u0303 \u2248 \u03bb(1 + \u03bb). For instance\nTc \u223c 100 K in HTSC oxides can be explained by the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory for \u03bb \u223c 2, while in the nonMigdal theory much smaller coupling constant is needed,\ni.e. \u03bb \u223c 0.5.\n(8) The existence of the forward scattering peak in\nEPI can in a plausible way explain the ARPES puzzle\nthat the anti-nodal kink is shifted by the maximal superconducting gap \u2206max while the nodal kink is unshifted.\nThe reason is (as explained in Subsection III.C), that the\nEPI spectral function \u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03a9) \u2248 \u03b12 F (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 , \u03a9) is\nstrongly peaked due to strong correlations at \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 = 0\n[116].\n(9) Finally, the scattering potential on non-magnetic\nimpurities is renormalized by strong correlations giving\nalso the forward scattering peak in scattering potential\n(amplitude) [120]. The latter effect gives large d-wave\nchannel in the renormalized impurity potential what is\nthe reason that the d-wave pairing in HTSC cuprates is\nrobust in the presence of non-magnetic impurities (and\ndefects) [3], [120].\n\n\f51\nE.\n\nEPI and strong correlations - other methods\n\nThe calculations of the static (adiabatic) charge-vertex\n\u03b3 c (kF , q) in the X-method are done for the case U = \u221e\n[51], [96], [97] where it is found that it is peaked at q = 0\n- forward scattering peak (FSP). This result is confirmed\nby the numerical Monte-Carlo calculations for the finiteU Hubbard model [168], where it is found that FSP exists\nfor all U , but it is especially pronounced in the limit\nt \u226a U . These results are additionally confirmed in the\ncalculations [171] within the four slave-boson method of\nKotliar-R\u00fcckenstein where \u03b3 c (kF , q) is again peaked at\nq = 0 and the peak is also pronounced at t \u226a U .\nThere are several calculations of the charge vertex\nin the one slave-boson method [169], [172], [173], [174]\nwhich is invented to study the limit U \u2192 \u221e. It is interesting to compare the results for the charge vertex in the\nX-method [51], [96], [97] and in the one slave-boson theory [172] which are calculated in O((1/N )0 ) order. For\ninstance, for J = 0 one has\n\u03b3 (X)\nc (k, q) =\n\n\u03b3 c(SB) (k, q) =\n\n1 + b(q) \u2212 a(q)t(k)\n2\n\n[1 + b(q)] \u2212 a(q)c(q)\n\n1 + b(q) \u2212 a(q) [t(k) + t(k + q)] /2\n[1 + b(q)]2 \u2212 a(q)c(q)\n\n(97)\n\n. (98)\n\nThe explicit expressions for the \"bare\" susceptibilities\na(q), b(q) and c(q) can be found in [51], [96]. It is obvious\n(X)\n(SB)\nfrom Eqs.(97-98) that \u03b3 c (k, q = 0) =\u03b3 c (k, q = 0)\n(X)\nbut the calculations give that max{\u03b3 c (k, q)} is for q =\n(SB)\n0, while max{\u03b3 c (k, q)} is for q 6= 0 [141]. So, the\nSB vertex is peaked at finite q which is in contradiction\nwith the numerical Monte Carlo results for the Hubbard\nmodel [168] and with the four slave-bosons theory [171].\nThe reason for the discrepancy of the one slave-boson\n(SB) in studying EPI with the numerical results and the\nX-method is not clear and might be due to the symmetry\nbreaking of the local gauge invariance in leading order of\nthe SB theory.\nVIII.\n\nto the suppression of doubly occupancy at the Cu lattice\nsites in the CuO2 planes, which drastically weakens the\nscreening effect in these systems. The pronounced nonlocality and suppression of the screening is mathematically expressed by the charge vertex function \u03b3 c (kF , q, \u03c9)\nwhich multiplies the bare coupling constants. This function is peaked at q = 0 and strongly suppressed at large\nq, especially for low (oxygen) hole doping \u03b4 \u226a 1 near the\nMott-Hubbard transition. Such a structure of \u03b3 c gives\nthat the d-wave and s-wave coupling constant are of the\nsame order of magnitude around and below some optimal doping \u03b4 op \u2248 0.1, i.e. \u03bbd \u2248 \u03bbs . This is very peculiar\nsituation never met before. Since the residual effective\n(low-energy) Coulomb interaction is much smaller in the\nd-channel than in the s-channel, i.e. \u03bc\u2217s \u226b \u03bc\u2217d , then the\ncritical temperature for d-wave pairing is much larger\n(d)\n(s)\nthan for the s-wave one, i.e. Tc \u226b Tc . Since all charge\nfluctuation processes are modified by strong correlations\nthen the quasi-particle scattering on non-magnetic impurities is drastically changed, that the pair-breaking effect on d-wave pairing is drastically reduced. This nonlocal effect, which is not discussed here - see more [3]\nand References therein, is one of the main reasons for\nthe robustness of d-wave pairing in HTSC oxides in the\npresence of non-magnetic impurities and numerous local\ndefects. The development of the forward scattering peak\nin \u03b3 c (kF , q) and suppression at large q(\u226b qc = \u03b4(\u03c0/a))\ngives rise to the suppression of the transport coupling\nconstant \u03bbtr making it much smaller than the self-energy\ncoupling constant \u03bb, i.e. one has \u03bbtr \u2248 \u03bb/3 near the optimal doping \u03b4 = 0.1\u22120.2. Thus the behavior of the vertex\nfunction and the dominance of EPI in quasi-particle scattering resolves the experimental puzzle that the transport\nand and self-energy coupling constant take very different values, \u03bbtr,ep \u226a \u03bbep . This is not the case with the\nSFI mechanism which is dominant at large q thus giving\n\u03bbtr,sf \u2248 \u03bbsf .\nWe stress that the strength of the EPI coupling constants \u03bbep , \u03bbep,d is at present impossible to calculate since\nit is difficult to incorporate strong correlations and numerous structural effects in a tractable microscopic theory.\n\nSUMMARY OF PART II\nIX.\n\nThe experimental results in HTSC cuprates which are\nexposed in Part I imply that EPI coupling constant is\nlarge and in order to be conform with d-wave pairing\nthis interaction must be very nonlocal (long range), i.e.\nweakly screened and peaked at small transfer momenta.\nIn absence of quantitative calculations in the framework\nof the ab initio microscopic many-body theory the effects\nof strong correlations on EPI are studied within the minimal t\u2212J model where this pronounced non-locality is due\nto two main reasons: (1) strong electronic correlations\nand (2) mixed metallic-ionic layered structure in these\nmaterials. In the case (1) the pronounced non-locality of\nEPI, which is found in the t \u2212 J model system, is due\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nNumerous experimental results related to tunnelling,\noptics, ARPES, inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering\nmeasurements in HTSC cuprates at and near the optimal\ndoping give evidence for strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with the coupling constant 1 < \u03bbep < 3.5. The\ntunnelling measurements furnish evidence for strong EPI\nwhich give that the peaks in the bosonic spectral function\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9) coincide well with the peaks in the phonon density of states Fph (\u03c9). The tunnelling spectra show that\nalmost all phonons contribute to Tc and that no particular phonon mode can be singled out in the spectral\nfunction \u03b12 F (\u03c9) as being the only one which dominates\n\n\f52\nin pairing mechanism. In light of these results the small\noxygen isotope effect in optimally doped systems can be\npartly due this effect, thus not disqualifying the important role of EPI in pairing mechanism. The compatibility\nof the strong EPI with d-wave pairing implies an important constraint on the EPI pairing potential - it must\nbe nonlocal, i.e. peaked at small transfer momenta. The\nlatter is due to: (a) strong electronic correlations and (b)\nthe mixed metallic-ionic structure of these materials. If\nEPI is the main player in pairing in HTSC cuprates then\nthis non-locality implies that at and below some optimal\ndoping (\u03b4 op \u223c 0.1) the magnitude of the EPI coupling\nconstants in d-wave and s-wave channel must be of the\nsame order, i.e. \u03bbep,d \u2248 \u03bbep,s . This result in conjunction with the fact that the residual effective Coulomb\ncoupling in d-wave channel is much smaller than in the\ns-wave one, i.e. \u03bc\u2217s \u226b \u03bc\u2217d gives that the critical temperature for d-wave pairing is much larger than for s-wave\npairing.\nThe tunnelling, ARPES, optic and magnetic neutron\nscattering measurements give sufficient evidence that the\nspin fluctuation interaction (SFI) plays a secondary role\nin pairing in HTSC cuprates. Especially important evidence for the smallness of SFI (in pairing) comes from the\nmagnetic neutron scattering measurements which show\nthat by varying doping slightly around the optimal one\nthere is a huge reconstruction of the SFI spectral function\nIm\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) (imaginary part of the spin susceptibility)\nwhile there is very small change in the critical temperature Tc . These experimental results imply important constraints on the pairing scenario for systems at and near\noptimal doping: (1) the strength of the d-wave pairing\npotential is provided by EPI (i.e. one has \u03bbep,d \u2248 \u03bbep,s )\nwhile the role of SFI, together with the residual Coulomb\ninteraction, is to trigger d-wave pairing; (2) the MigdalEliashberg theory, but with the pronounced momentum\ndependent of EPI, is a rather good starting theory.\nThe ab initio microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC\ncuprates fails at present to calculate Tc and to predict\nthe magnitude of the d-wave order parameter. From that\npoint of view it is hardly to expect a significant improvement of this situation at least in the near future. However, the studies of some minimal (toy) models, such as\nthe single band t \u2212 J model, allow us to understand part\nof the physics in cuprates on a qualitative and in some\ncases even on a semi-quantitative level. In that respect\nthe encouraging results come from the theoretical studies\nof EPI in the t \u2212 J model by using controllable mathematical methods. This theory predicts dressing of quasiparticles by strong correlations which dig up a large scale\ncorrelation hole of the size \u03be ch \u223c a/\u03b4 for \u03b4 \u226a 1. These\nquasi-particles respond to lattice vibrations in such a way\nto produce an effective electron interaction (due to EPI)\nwhich is long ranged, i.e. the effective pairing potential\nVef f (q, \u03c9) is peaked at small transfer momenta q - forward scattering peak. This theory (of the toy model)\nis conform with the experimental scenario by predicting\nthe following results: (i) the EPI coupling constants in\n\nd-wave and s-wave channels are of the same order, i.e.\n\u03bbep,d \u2248 \u03bbep,s , at some optimal doping \u03b4 op \u223c 0.1; (ii)\nthe transport coupling is much smaller than the pairing\none, i.e. \u03bbtr \u2248 \u03bb/3; (iii) due to strong correlations there\nis forward scattering peak in the potential for scattering\non non-magnetic impurities, thus making d-wave pairing\nrobust in materials with a lot of defects and impurities.\nApplied to HTSC superconductors at and near the optimal doping this theory is a realization of the MigdalEliashberg theory but with strongly momentum dependent EPI coupling, which is conform with the proposed\nexperimental pairing scenario. This scenario which is also\nrealized in the t \u2212 J toy model may be useful in making a\n(phenomenological) theory of pairing in cuprates. However, all present theories are confronted with the unsolved\nand challenging task - the calculation of Tc . From that\npoint of view we do not have at present a proper microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC cuprates.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe devote this paper to our great teacher and friend\nVitalii Lazarevich Ginzburg who passed away recently.\nHis permanent interest in our work and support in\nmany respects over many years are unforgettable.

It turns out\nthat in low-temperature superconductors the peaks of\n\u2212d2 I/dV 2 at eVi = \u2206 + \u03c9 ph,i correspond to the peak\npositions of \u03b12 F (\u03c9) and F (\u03c9). However, we would like\nto point out that in HTSC cuprates the gap function is\nunconventional and very anisotropic, i.e. \u2206(k, i\u03c9 n ) \u223c\ncos kx a \u2212 cos ky a. Since in this case the extraction of\n\u03b12 F (k, k\u2032 , \u03c9) is difficult and at present rather unrealistic task, then an \"average\" \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is extracted from the\nexperimental curve GS (V ). There is belief that it gives\nrelevant information on the real spectral function such as\nthe energy width of the bosonic spectrum (0 < \u03c9 < \u03c9max )\nand positions and distributions of peaks due to bosons. It\nturns out that even such an approximate procedure gives\nvaluable information in HTSC cuprates - see discussion\nin Section III D.\nNote that in the case when both EPI and spinfluctuation interaction (SFI) are present one should make\n\u2206\ndifference between \u03bbZ\nkp (i\u03bd n ) and \u03bbkp (i\u03bd n ) defined by\n\u03bbZ\nkp (i\u03bd n ) = \u03bbsf,kp (i\u03bd n ) + \u03bbep,kp (i\u03bd n ),\n\n(112)\n\n\u03bb\u2206\nkp = \u03bbep,kp (i\u03bd n ) \u2212 \u03bbsf,kp (i\u03bd n ).\n\n(113)\n\n\u2206\nIn absence of EPI \u03bbZ\nkp (i\u03bd n ) and \u03bbkp (i\u03bd n ) differ by sign\n\u2206\ni.e. \u03bbZ\nkp (i\u03bd n ) = \u2212\u03bbkp (i\u03bd n ) > 0 since SFI is repulsive\ninteraction in the singlet pairing-channel.\n\n1.\n\nInversion of tunnelling data\n\nPhonon features in the conductance \u03c3 N S (V ) at eV =\n\u22060 + \u03c9 ph makes the tunnelling spectroscopy a powerful method in obtaining the Eliashberg spectral function\n\u03b12 F (\u03c9). Two methods were used in the past for extracting \u03b12 F (\u03c9).\nThe first method is based on solving the inverse problem of the nonlinear Eliashberg equations. Namely, by\nmeasuring \u03c3 N S (V ), one obtains the tunnelling density of\nstates NT (\u03c9)(\u223c \u03c3 N S (\u03c9)) and by the inversion procedure\none gets \u03b12 F (\u03c9) [177]. In reality the method is based on\nthe iteration procedure - the McMillan-Rowell (M R) inversion, where in the first step an initial \u03b12 Fini (\u03c9), \u03bc\u2217ini\nand \u2206ini (\u03c9) are inserted into Eliashberg equations (for\ninstance \u2206ini (\u03c9) = \u22060 for \u03c9 < \u03c90 and \u2206ini (\u03c9) = 0 for\n\n\u03c9 > \u03c90 ) and then \u03c3 ini (V ) is calculated. In the second\nstep the functional derivative \u03b4\u03c3(\u03c9)/\u03b4\u03b12 F (\u03c9) (\u03c9 \u2261 eV )\nis found in the presence of a small change of \u03b12 Fini (\u03c9)\nand then the iterated solution \u03b12 F(1) (\u03c9) = \u03b12 Fini (\u03c9)+\n\u03b4\u03b12 F (\u03c9) is obtained, where the correction \u03b4\u03b12 F (\u03c9) is\ngiven by\nZ\n\u03b4\u03c3 ini (V ) \u22121\n\u03b4\u03b12 F (\u03c9) = d\u03bd[ 2\n] [\u03c3 exp (\u03bd) \u2212 \u03c3 ini (\u03bd)]. (114)\n\u03b4\u03b1 F (\u03bd)\nThe procedure is iterated until \u03b12 F(n) (\u03c9) and \u03bc\u2217(n) converge to \u03b12 F (\u03c9) and \u03bc\u2217 which reproduce the experimentally obtained conductance \u03c3 exp\nN S (V ). In such a way the\nobtained \u03b12 F (\u03c9) for P b resembles the phonon density\nof states FP b (\u03c9), that is obtained from neutron scattering measurements. Note that the method depends explicitly on \u03bc\u2217 but on the contrary it requires only data\non \u03c3 N S (V ) up to the voltage Vmax = \u03c9max\nph + \u22060 where\n2\n\u03c9max\nis\nthe\nmaximum\nphonon\nenergy\n(\u03b1\nF (\u03c9) = 0 for\nph\nmax\n\u03c9 > \u03c9 ph ) and \u22060 is the zero-temperature superconducting gap. One pragmatical feature for the interpretation\nof tunnelling spectra (and for obtaining the spectral pairing function \u03b12 F (\u03c9)) in LT S and HT SC cuprates is that\nthe negative peaks of d2 I/dV 2 are at the peak positions\nof \u03b12 F (\u03c9) and F (\u03c9). This feature will be discussed later\non in relation with experimental situation in cuprates.\nThe second method has been invented in [178] and it\nis based on the combination of the Eliashberg equations\nand dispersion relations for the Greens functions - we call\nit GDS method. First, the tunnelling density of states\nis extracted from the tunnelling conductance in a more\nrigorous way [179]\nZ V\n1\n\u03c3 N S (V )\n\u2212 \u2217\ndu\nNT (V ) =\n\u03c3 N N (V ) \u03c3 (V ) 0\n\u00d7\n\nd\u03c3 \u2217 (u)\n[NT (V \u2212 u) \u2212 NT (V )]\ndu\n\n(115)\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2217 (V ) = exp{\u2212\u03b2V }\u03c3 N N (V ) and the constant \u03b2\nare obtained from \u03c3 N N (V ) at large biases - see [178].\nNT (V ) under the integral can be replaced by the BCS\ndensity of states. Since the second method is used in\nextracting \u03b12 F (\u03c9) in a number of LTSC as well as in\nHTSC cuprates - see below, we describe it briefly for\nthe case of isotropic EPI at T=0 K. In that case the\nEliashberg equations are [45], [175], [176], [178]\n\"\n#\nZ \u221e\n\u2206(\u03c9 \u2032 )\n\u2032\nd\u03c9 Re\nZ(\u03c9)\u2206(\u03c9) =\n1/2\n\u22060\n[\u03c9\u20322 \u2212 \u22062 (\u03c9 \u2032 )]\n\u00d7 [K+ (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 \u03b8(\u03c9 c \u2212 \u03c9)]\n1\n1 \u2212 Z(\u03c9) =\n\u03c9\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u22060\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032 Re\n\n\"\n\n\u03c9\u2032\n[\u03c9 \u20322 \u2212 \u22062 (\u03c9 \u2032 )]\n\n1/2\n\n(116)\n#\n\nK\u2212 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 )\n(117)\n\n\f55\nwhere\n\u2032\n\nK\u00b1 (\u03c9, \u03c9 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 max\nph\n\nd\u03bd\u03b12 F (\u03bd)(\n\n\u22060\n\n\u00b1\n\n1\n\u03c9 \u2032 + \u03c9 + \u03bd + i0+\n\n1\n).\n\u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 + \u03bd \u2212 i0+\n\n(118)\n\nHere \u03bc\u2217 is the Coulomb pseudo-potential, the cutoff \u03c9c is\napproximately (5 \u2212 10) \u03c9max\nph , \u22060 = \u2206(\u22060 ) is the energy\ngap.

However, the integral\nequation for \u03b12 F (\u03c9) is linear Fredholm equation of the\nfirst kind which is ill-defined - see the discussion in Section II.B.2.\n2.\n\nPhonon effects in NT (\u03c9)\n\nWe briefly discuss the physical origin for the phonon\neffects in NT (\u03c9) by considering a model with only one\npeak, at \u03c9 0 , in the phonon density of states F (\u03c9) by assuming for simplicity \u03bc\u2217 = 0 and neglecting the weak\nstructure in NT (\u03c9) at n\u03c9 0 + \u22060 , which is due to the\nnonlinear structure of the Eliashberg equations [180]. In\nFig.38 it is seen that the real gap \u2206R (\u03c9) reaches a maximum at \u03c9 0 + \u22060 then decreases, becomes negative and\nzero, while \u2206I (\u03c9) is peaked slightly beyond \u03c9 0 + \u22060 that\nis the consequence of the effective electron-electron interaction via phonons.\n\nFIG. 38. (a) Model phonon density of states F (\u03c9) with the\npeak at \u03c9 0 . (b) The real (solid) \u2206R and imaginary (dashed)\npart \u2206I of the gap \u2206(\u03c9). (c) The normalized tunnelling density of states NT (\u03c9)/N (0) (solid) compared with the BCS\ndensity of states (dashed). From [180].\n\nIt follows that for \u03c9 < \u03c90 + \u22060 most phonons have\nhigher energies than the energy \u03c9 of electronic charge\nfluctuations and there is over-screening of this charge by\nions giving rise to attraction. For \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c90 + \u22060 charge\nfluctuations are in resonance with ion vibrations giving\nrise to the peak in \u2206R (\u03c9). For \u03c90 +\u22060 < \u03c9 the ions move\nout of phase with respect to charge fluctuations giving\nrise to repulsion and negative \u2206R (\u03c9). This is shown in\nFig. 38(b). The structure in \u2206(\u03c9) is reflected on NT (\u03c9)\nas shown in Fig. 38(c) which can be reconstructed from\nthe approximate formula for NT (\u03c9) expanded in powers\nof \u2206/\u03c9\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 #\nNT (\u03c9)\n\u2206R (\u03c9)\n1\n\u2206I (\u03c9)\n.

In the presence of\nseveral bosonic scattering processes the transport selfenergy \u03a3tr (\u03c9) = Re\u03a3tr (\u03c9) + iIm\u03a3tr (\u03c9) is given by\nXZ \u221e\n\u03a3tr (\u03c9) = \u2212\nd\u03bd\u03b12tr,l Fl (\u03bd)[K1 (\u03c9, \u03bd) + iK2 (\u03c9, \u03bd)],\nl\n\n\u00d7 G(k + q)\u0393j (q, k + q)G(q),\n\n(124)\n\nwhere q = (q, \u03bd) and k = (k = 0, \u03c9) and the bare current\nvertex \u03b3 i (q, k + q; k = 0) is related to the Fermi velocity\nvF,i , i.e. \u03b3 i (q, k + q; k = 0) = vF,i . The vertex function\n\u0393j (q, k + q) takes into account the renormalization due to\nall scattering processes responsible for finite conductivity\n[181]. In the following we study only the in-plane conductivity at k = 0. The latter case is realized due to the long\npenetration depth in HTSC cuprates and the skin depth\nin the normal state are very large. In the EP I theory,\n\u0393j (q, k + q) \u2261 \u0393j (q, i\u03c9 n , i\u03c9n + i\u03c9 m ) is a solution of an\napproximative integral equation written in the symbolic\nform [83] \u0393j = vj + Vef f GG\u0393j . The effective\npotential\nP\nVef f (due to EPI) is given by Vef f = \u03ba | g\u03baren |2 D\u03ba ,\nwhere D\u03ba is the phonon Green's function.
