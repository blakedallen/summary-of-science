P. McGuire, C. Ciuti, L. J. Sham\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0310259v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 10 Oct 2003\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0319.\n(Dated: November 12, 2018)\nNovel spin transport behavior is theoretically shown to result from replacing the usual metal\n(or poly-silicon) gate in a silicon field-effect transistor with a ferromagnet, separated from the\nsemiconductor by an ultra-thin oxide. The spin-dependent interplay between the drift current (due\nto a source-drain bias) and the diffusion current (due to carrier leakage into the ferromagnetic gate)\nresults in a rich variety of spin dependence in the current that flows through such a device. We\nexamine two cases of particular interest: (1) creating a 100% spin-polarized electrical current and\n(2) creating a pure spin current without a net electrical current. A spin-valve consisting of two\nsequential ferromagnetic gates is shown to exhibit magnetoresistance dependent upon the relative\norientations of the magnetization of the two ferromagnets. The magnetoresistance ratio grows to\narbitrarily large values in the regime of low source-drain bias, and is limited only by the spin-flip\ntime in the channel.\n\nThe creation, manipulation, and detection of spinpolarized carriers are the essential ingredients of semiconductor spintronics.1,2,3 Although well established using optical methods,4,5,6 the ultimate goal is to achieve\nthis level of control over the spin degree of freedom in allelectrical devices.7 To this end, spin injection from ferromagnets into semiconductors8,9,10,11 and spin control\nthrough the Rashba spin-orbit effect12,13,14,15,16 have attracted much interest during the last few years. In addition, it has recently been proposed17 and experimentally\nverified18,19 that a pure spin current, without an accompanying electrical current, can be created in direct-gap\nsemiconductors using the interference of one- and twophoton absorption processes. Such pure spin currents\nwill allow for new probes of spin-dependent phenomena\nin semiconductors and may lead to alternate spintronics\ndevice designs not present in existing charge-based technology.\nIn this paper we present a method of creating fully\nspin-polarized charge currents and pure spin currents\nusing a ferromagnetically-gated inversion layer in the\nregime of low source-drain bias.20,21 Our method is possible in any semiconductor, notably silicon, and not just\nthose with well-defined optical transitions. It relies on\na proximity effect in which semiconductor carriers acquire spin-dependent properties through coupling with\na nearby ferromagnet.25 Experiments have shown that\noptically-pumped unpolarized electrons in a semiconductor acquire a net spin-polarization in the presence of an\ninterface with a ferrromagnet.22,23,24 The magnitude of\nthe spin-dependent effects are optimized by confining the\nsemiconductor carriers at the interface with the ferromagnet, with the ferromagnet acting as the electricallybiased gate responsible for the inversion. The crucial\nparameter is the thickness of the oxide barrier which\nseparates the semiconductor from the ferromagnet; since\nthe coupling of the two depends exponentially on their\nseparation, our proposal will be most relevant for ultrathin gate oxides at the forefront of current technology.26\nThe balance of growing oxides thin enough to produce\nample coupling while preserving the functionality of the\n\ninversion layer is delicate, although we point out that\nwe are merely taking advantage of the aggressive scaling of field-effect transistors to the nanoscale. In addition, we will discuss the behavior of a recently-proposed\nspin-valve with two sequential ferromagnetic gates in the\nsame regime of low source-drain bias, where the magnetoresistance ratio due to the relative orientation of the\nferromagnet magnetizations can grow to arbitarily large\nvalues.\nTo demonstrate the operational principle of the device,\nconsider the spin-dependent current in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG). We will concentrate on the silicon\ninversion layer with an SiO2 barrier and a ferromagnetic\ngate, and consider only a single occupied subband in the\nsilicon. For simplicity, we will assume the two spin channels are completely decoupled, but we will return to address any coupling between the two spin channels later in\nthe paper. The device is shown in Fig. 1(a); the growth\naxis is in the \u1e91-direction, the in-plane current flows in the\nx\u0302-direction, and we assume the device is translationally\ninvariant in the \u0177-direction. The in-plane electrical current J\u03c3 (x) in spin channel \u03c3 = {\u2191, \u2193} contains both drift\nand diffusion terms,\nJ\u03c3 (x) = g\u03c3 (x)Ex + eD\u03c3 (x)\n\n\u2202\nN\u03c3 (x) ,\n\u2202x\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2212e is the electron charge, g\u03c3 (x) is the Drude\nconductivity, Ex is the electric field that drives the inplane current, D\u03c3 (x) is the diffusion constant, and N\u03c3 (x)\nis spatially-dependent 2DEG density. To achieve spindependent transport, either the transport coefficients or\nthe 2DEG density must vary considerable between the\ntwo spin channels. We show below how the coupling between the 2DEG and a ferromagnetic gate achieves this\nsplitting.\nIn Ref. 20 the coupling was calculated from the wavefunction matching conditions, resulting in an equation\nwhich specified the spin-dependent complex energy of\nthe confined inversion layer state coupled to the ferromagnet. In Ref. 21 an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian was derived from the effective-mass Hamiltonian of\n\n\f2\nthe silicon/SiO2 /ferromagnet interface. The form of this\nHamiltonian allowed for the calculation of the 2DEG selfenergy due to the interaction with the ferromagnet, the\napproach we will adopt in this paper. The results of\nthe derivation in Ref. 21 are summarized below in order to clarify the method of calculation used throughout\nthe rest of this paper. The effective Hamiltonian of the\n2DEG coupled to the ferromagnetic gate is\nX\nX \u2020\nH =\na\u2020\u03c3 \u01ebsi a\u03c3 +\nck,\u03c3 \u01ebfm\nk,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\nVsd\n\n(a)\n\nVg\nSource\n\nInduced 2DEG\n\nDrain\n\nsilicon\n\nk,\u03c3\n\ni\nXh\n\u0001\nfm\nfm \u22c6\n+\na\u03c3 .\nck,\u03c3 + c\u2020k,\u03c3 Vk,\u03c3\na\u2020\u03c3 Vk,\u03c3\n\n(2)\n\nk,\u03c3\n\nA one-dimensional calculation is possible for the coupling calculation because the conservation of the in-plane\nwavevector is relaxed.27,28 The operator a\u2020\u03c3 creates the\ninversion layer state with spin \u03c3, energy \u01ebsi , and wavefunction \u03c7si (z), which is the lowest bound state of the\npotential\nh\ni\nV si (z) = \u2212\u0168b \u2212 eEzsi * (z \u2212 zb ) \u0398(z \u2212 zb ) , (3)\nwhere \u0168b is the oxide barrier height from the bottom of\nthe semiconductor potential, Ezsi is the electric field in the\nsemiconductor, and zb is the thickness of the oxide barrier. The \"0\" of energy has been put at the top right side\nof the barrier to simplify the calculations. The operator\nc\u2020k,\u03c3 creates a ferromagnet state with spin \u03c3, wavevecfm\ntor k, energy \u01ebfm\nk,\u03c3 , and wavefunction \u03c6k,\u03c3 (z), which are\nstates of the potential\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2206\nfm\nV\u03c3 (z) = \u2212 Ufm + \u03c3\u0302 * M\u0302 \u0398(\u2212z)\n2\n\u2212eEzb * (z \u2212 zb )\u0398(z)\u0398(zb \u2212 z) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Ufm + \u2206/2 is the Fermi energy of the majority spin\nband in the ferromagnet, Ufm \u2212 \u2206/2 is the Fermi energy\nof the minority spin band in the ferromagnet, and Ezb is\nthe electric field in the barrier. Note that for simplicity we treat the ferromagnet as exchange-split parabolic\nbands.29 The coupling between the 2DEG and the ferromagnet is approximated by\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2217 fm\nfm\nsi\nVk,\u03c3\n= dz \u03c6fm\n(5)\nk,\u03c3 (z) V\u03c3 (z)\u03c7 (z) ,\nwhich is basically an overlap integral with an exponentially decaying term. Eq. (2) is an approximation of the\neffective-mass Hamiltonian of the Si/SiO2 /ferromagnet\ninterface in which only the most signifcant terms in the\ncoupling have been retained.\nFrom the simple tight-binding Hamiltonian, Eq.

The source-drain bias Vsd creates the inplane field Ex that drives the drift current. The ferromagnetic\ngate is biased (Vg ) to create the inversion layer. (b) The spinvalve with two adjacent ferromagnetic gates; the two ferromagnets have different coercive fields to enable the switching\nof the second gate's magnetization without affecting that of\nthe first gate. The gap between the two ferromagnets is filled\nwith a paramagnetic metal to ensure uniform 2DEG confinement throughout the device.\n\nTo account for strong scattering in the ferromagnet,\na large imaginary part has been added to the ferrofm\nmagnet states (\u03b3k,\u03c3\n). Calculating the complex energy\n\u1ebc which satisfies \u1ebc \u2212 \u01ebsi + i0+ \u2212 \u03a3\u03c3 (\u1ebc) = 0, we\ncan evaluate both\nthei spin-dependent 2DEG level shift,\nh\n\u2206\u03c3 (\u1ebc) = Re \u03a3\u03c3 (\u1ebc) , and the spin-dependent 2DEG\nh\ni\nlifetime, \u03c4\u03c3 (\u1ebc) = \u2212h\u0304/2Im \u03a3\u03c3 (\u1ebc) , due to the coupling\nwith the ferromagnet. The spin-splitting due to the level\nshift, |\u2206\u2191 \u2212 \u2206\u2193 |, is very small compared to the Fermi\nenergy of the 2DEG for even the thinnest practical oxides, and will be neglected. On the other hand, the spindependent lifetime, which represents the time for an inversion layer electron to irreversibly \"fall\" into the ferromagnet, is in the picosecond range for oxide thickness'\nbelow 10 \u00c5, which approaches the intrinsic scattering\ntime of the silicon inversion layer, \u03c40 \u2248 1 ps.30 The ratio\nof the lifetimes for the two spin channels \u03c4\u2193 /\u03c4\u2191 is roughly\na factor of 2 for all oxide thicknesses; spin-dependent\ntransport results, which can be harnassed for spintronics purposes. Using the following parameters for the\nSi/SiO2 /Fe interface, we calculate the scattering times\nto be \u03c4\u2191 = 3 ps and \u03c4\u2193 = 6 ps. For silicon, the longi-\n\n\f3\n\nNote that because the flow of electrons is opposite to the\ncurrent, electrons leaking out of the 2DEG into the ferromagnetic gate implies that a positive current flows into\nthe 2DEG; the current will increase under the gate. Combined with Eq. (1) and the appropriate boundary conditions (the 2DEG has its equilibrium density at the source\nand drain, N\u03c3 (xs ) = N\u03c3 (xd ) = N0 /2), this results in\na differential equation for the spatially-dependent, spindependent 2DEG density.

In the following we assume the gate\nlength in the x\u0302-direction is approximately 1000 \u00c5, so that\nthe source is at xs = 0 and the drain is at xd = 1000 \u00c5,\nand we assume that the gate extends 1 \u03bcm in the \u0177direction. For concreteness, we will assume throughout\nthis paper that the in-plane electric field is negative,\nEx < 0, such that, in the absence of leakage, a negative current would flow through the 2DEG ( electrons\nflow from the source to the drain). In addition, we assume the confinement is homogeneous along the channel,\nso that \u03c4\u2191 and \u03c4\u2193 are constant.\nIn a silicon field-effect transistor with a thick gate oxide there is no leakage of 2DEG electrons because the\n\nDrain Current (\u03bcA)\n\n20\n0\n\nJ\u2191(xd)\n\n\u221220\n\nJ (x )\n\u2193\n\n\u221240\n\nB\n\nA\n\u221260 1\n10\n\nd\n\nC\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n50\n\nDrain Current (\u03bcA)\n\ntudinal effective mass responsible for the confinement is\nm\u22c6si,l = 0.91m0 , the transverse effective mass responsible for 2DEG transport is m\u22c6si,t = 0.19m0 , the dielectric\nconstant is \u01ebsi = 11.7, and the equilibrium density of the\n2DEG is assumed to be N0 = 1012 cm\u22122 .30 For silicon\ndioxide the effective mass is m\u22c6b = 0.3m0 , the dielectric\nconstant is \u01ebb = 3.9, and the barrier height (from the\nFermi level) is Ub = 3.2 eV.31 For the ferromagnet, we\nuse Ufm = 2.65 eV, exchange splitting \u2206 = 3.9 eV, effective mass m\u22c6fm = m0 ,29 and, for simplicity, a wavevectorindependent imaginary part of the ferromagnetic energy\n\u03b3\u2191fm = 1.1 eV and \u03b3\u2193fm = 0.8 eV.32 The electric field in\nthe barrier is assumed to be Ezb = \u221210 MeV/cm.\nHaving calculated the \u1e91-axis properties of the\nferromagnetically-gated silicon field-effect transistor, we\nnow examine the 2DEG transport in the x\u0302-direction.

At the in-plane fields\nmarked A and C the drain current is 100% spin-polarized;\nat B, a pure spin current flows through the drain.\n\nwavefunction cannot penetrate into the gate. Neglecting the spin dependence for the time being, we examine\nthe behavior of a silicon field-effect transistor with an\nultra-thin gate oxide. Finite penetration of the 2DEG\nwavefunction through the oxide and into the gate causes\na tunnel current to flow. The Fermi level in the gate is\nlower than the Fermi level in the inversion layer due to\nthe gate bias; electrons that tunnel into the gate will inelastically fall to the gate Fermi level and have no way to\nreturn to the 2DEG, decreasing the density in the 2DEG.\nThe density will be near its equilibrium value N0 at the\nsource and drain contacts, where electrons are injected\ninto the 2DEG. The density will be lowest near the center of the gate, furthest from the source and drain. With\nno source-drain bias the density profile will be symmetric\nabout the center of the gate; electrons will flow into the\n2DEG from both the source and the drain, such that the\ndrain current is positive.26 Application of a source drain\nbias will break this symmetry, causing a drift current to\nflow in addition to the diffusive current due the electron\nleakage. For negative in-plane field Ex < 0, at some critical field the drift current will exactly cancel the diffusive\nbackflow at the drain; the net drain current will be zero.\nAs the in-plane field is made more negative the drain current becomes negative, such that in the high source-drain\nbias regime the diffusive current is negligible.\nWith a ferromagnetic gate, the above analysis still\nholds for each spin channel separately (provided that\nthe spin-flip time is much longer than the transit time\nthrough the device). The lifetime for 2DEG electrons\nto fall into the gate is spin-dependent due to the spindependent coupling in the Hamiltonian, Eq. (2).

The total current J\u2191 (xd ) + J\u2193 (xd )\nand the spin current J\u2191 (xd ) \u2212 J\u2193 (xd ) are plotted as functions of |Ex | in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. At very low\nsource-drain bias the drain currents are positive in both\nspin channels, but have different magnitudes due to the\ndifferent leakage rates for the two spin channels; because\n\u03c4\u2191 < \u03c4\u2193 , more spin \u2191 electrons leak than \u2193 electrons. The\nlarger gradient in the density in the spin \u2191 channel results\nin J\u2191 (xd ) > J\u2193 (xd ). At the in-plane field marked A, the\ndrain current in the \u2193 spin channel is J\u2193 (xd ) = 0; the\ndiffusive current is exactly cancelled by the drift current.\nThe larger diffusive current in the spin \u2191 channel is still of\nhigher magnitude than the drift current. Spin \u2191 electrons\nwill flow into the 2DEG at the drain contact, resulting\nin a 100% spin-polarized current. At the in-plane field\nmarked B in Fig. 2, the drain currents in the two spin\nchannels are equal and opposite, J\u2191 (xd ) = \u2212J\u2193 (xd ). No\nnet charge current flows through the drain, but a pure\nspin current flows such that spin \u2191 electrons are transferred into the 2DEG and spin \u2193 electrons are transferred\nout of the 2DEG at the drain, i.e., the silicon inversion\nlayer acts as a spin pump at the field marked B. At the\nfield marked C the drain current in the spin \u2193 channel\nis negative, while in the spin \u2191 channel the drift and diffusive currents exactly cancel, J\u2191 (xd ) = 0. Spin \u2193 electrons will flow out of the the 2DEG, resulting in a 100%\nspin-polarized drain current. As the magnitude of the\nin-plane field is increased further the electrical currents\nin both spin channels are negative; the spin \u2193 channel\ncarries more current because its conductivity is higher\n\nthan that of the spin \u2191 channel. Electrons flow out of\nthe 2DEG drain with some polarization. Note that the\nroles of the spin channels can be exchanged by reversing the gate magnetization, such that the drain contact\nof this ferromagnetically-gated silicon inversion layer can\nbe used as a source for both fully spin-polarized charge\ncurrents and pure spin currents with either spin \u2191 or \u2193.\nFor positive in-plane electric fields Ex > 0, the same phenomena happen at the source contact.\nThe behavior of the spin-dependent currents throughout the 2DEG are plotted in Fig. 3 near the in-plane\nfields A (top panel), B (middle panel), and C (bottom\npanel). The leakage of electrons under the gate is evident, as the current is not constant and increases under\nthe gate. The plots show that in this region of sourcedrain bias the drift current is just beginning to overtake\nthe diffusion current at the drain contact (the drift and\ndiffusion currents flow in the same direction at the source\ncontact).\nThe spin effects present in the silicon inversion layer\nwith a single ferromagnetic gate could be very attractive for spintronics applications. We will now describe\na simple all-electrical measurement to take advantage\nof the spin-dependent 2DEG transport. Recently we\nproposed a planar semiconductor spin-valve which relies\nupon the coupling of the inversion layer electrons to sequential ferrromagnets.20,21 The space between the ferromagnets is filled with a paramagnetic metal to ensure\nhomogeneous 2DEG confinement throughout the device.\nA diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 1(b). The two\nferromagnets are patterned with different aspect ratios,\nsuch that the magnetization of one ferromagnet can be\nreversed by an external field without affect the magnetization of the other ferromagnet.\nAssuming the two spin channels are decoupled\nthroughout the device, let us examine the total 2DEG\ncurrent at the drain contact for parallel ferromagnet magnetizations, Jp (xd ). One spin channel will see the spin\n\u2191 scattering time \u03c4\u2191 under both ferromagnets, and the\nother spin channel will see the spin \u2193 scattering time \u03c4\u2193\nunder both ferromagnets; the total current Jp (xd ) will be\nthe sum of the currents in the two spin channels. Switching the magnetization of the second ferromagnet, one spin\nchannel will see the spin \u2191 scattering time \u03c4\u2191 under the\nfirst ferromagnet and the spin \u2193 scattering time \u03c4\u2193 under\nthe second ferromagnet, while the other spin channel will\nsee the reverse. Because the density and current must be\ncontinuous in both spin channels, the total drain current\nfor antiparallel magnetizations Jap (xd ) will in general be\ndifferent from Jp (xd ). The net result is a magnetoresistance effect, in which the 2DEG current is dependent\nupon the relative orientation of the ferromagnet magnetizations. We define the magnetoresistance ratio as\nM R = 100 * |\n\nJp (xd ) \u2212 Jap (xd )\n|.\nJp (xd )\n\n(10)\n\nThis quantity is plotted as the full line in Fig. 4 as a\nfunction of the in-plane electric field |Ex |, for an infi-\n\n\f5\n4\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0304 is spin opposite to \u03c3. The magnetoresistance\nratio is plotted for two values of the spin-flip time near\nthe intrisic scattering time, \u03c4sf = 1.0 ps (dashed line) and\n\u03c4sf = 0.1 ps (dotted line) in Fig. 4. Short spin-flip times\ndrastically reduce the M R; the currents in the two spin\nchannels are so strongly coupled that the total current\nthrough the 2DEG is only slightly altered when switching\nfrom parallel to antiparallel magnetizations. Although\nshort spin relaxation times should not be a problem in\nsilicon,33,34 it could be an issue in other semiconductors.\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nMR (%)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c4 =\u221e\nsf\n\n0\n\n10\n\n= 1.0 ps\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n= 0.1 ps\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n|E | (V/cm)\nx\n\nFIG. 4: A plot of the magnetoresistance ratio (%) as a function of the in-plane field |Ex | for the spin-valve with two ferromagnetic gates, for different values of the spin-flip time \u03c4sf .\nFor \u03c4sf = \u221e, the peak of the M R is limited only by the number of points in the calculation.\n\nnite spin-flip time (in which case the peak of the M R is\nlimited only by the number of data points in the plot).\nBoth ferromagnets are assumed to be 1000 \u00c5 long in the\nx\u0302-direction, with a 200 \u00c5 gap between them.

Matsukura, H.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown how the unavoidable issue of 2DEG carrier leakage in silicon field-effect transistors with ultra-thin gate oxides can be put to good\nuse for spintronics applications. By replacing the metal\ngate with a ferromagnet, the coupling between the silicon inversion layer and the gate becomes spin-dependent,\nresulting in spin-dependent 2DEG transport. In the low\nsource-drain bias regime, the drift current (first term on\nright side of Eq. (1)) and the diffusion current (second\nterm on right side of Eq. (1)) are of the same order; the\nspin-dependent interplay between the two results in a variety of spin currents that flow through the contacts to\nsuch a device. We have shown how the ferromagneticallygated silicon inversion layer can produce both fully spinpolarized charge currents and pure spin currents, without\nany net charge transfer. In addition, we have shown that\nif the gate is made up of two sequential ferromagnets,\na magnetoresistance effect occurs in the 2DEG current\ndependent upon the relative orientation of the two ferromagnet magnetizations. The magnetoresistance ratio\ncan exceed 100% in this low source-drain bias regime.\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nOhno, D. D. Awschalom, Nature 402, 790 (1999).\nH. J. Zhu, M.
