Krantz123\n\nNovember 20, 2018\n\nAbstract: We show that two smoothly bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domains which are diffeomorphic may be smoothly deformed into each other, with all intermediate domains being strongly\npseudoconvex. This result relates to Lempert's ideas about Kobayashi\nextremal discs, and also has intrinsic interest.\n\n0\n\nIntroduction\n\nEver since the solution of the Levi problem in the 1940s and 1950s, it has been\na matter of central importance to understand the geometry of pseudoconvex\ndomains. This investigation has many aspects, including topological features\nand analytic features.\nOne question that has received little attention is that of deforming one pseudoconvex domain into another. This matter is subtle. A form of the question\ncomes up at the end of Lempert's seminal paper [LEM], where he deforms\nstrongly convex domains. Of course that is a relatively easy matter, but it begs\nthe question (if one wants to generalize Lempert's results to strongly pseudoconvex domains) of deforming more general types of domains. See [KRA2] for\nan investigation of this type of generalization.\nIn the present paper we explore such deformation ideas, and we prove a positive deformation result for smoothly bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domains.\nOne interesting aspect of our approach is that we make decisive use of the\nFornaess embedding theorem [FOR]. This may be the first actual application of\nFornaess's theorem. Of course Fornaess's theorem applies only to strongly pseudoconvex domains, and there is no hope of adapting the techniques presented\n1 Author supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Dean of the\nGraduate School at Washington University.\n2 Key Words: domain of holomorphy, strongly pseudoconvex domains, deformations, convex domains.\n3 MR Classification Numbers: 32T15, 32T05, 32E05, 32E40.\n\n1\n\n\fhere to a more general class of domains. It is plausible that various natural\nclasses of Levi geometry should be preserved under smooth deformation, but\nthe techniques for proving a very general result do not seem to be available at\nthis time.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Jiye Yu for helpful conversations on the subject\nmatter of this paper.\n\n1\n\nPrincipal Results\n\nOur main theorem is this:\nTheorem 1 Let \u03a9\u22121 , \u03a91 be smoothly bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domains in Cn . Write \u03a9j = {z \u2208 Cn : \u03c1j (z) < 0}, j = \u22121, 1, where \u03c1j is a defining\nfunction for \u03a9j (see [KRA1] for this concept). Assume that \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91 are\ndiffeomorphic.\nThen there is a smooth deformation \u03c1(z, t) on Cn \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] so that, for each\nt \u2208 [\u22121, 1], the function \u03c1t (z) \u2261 \u03c1(z, t) is a smooth defining function. Also\n\u03c1(z, 0) = \u03c1\u22121 (z) and \u03c1(z, 1) = \u03c11 (z). Moreover, for each t \u2208 [\u22121, 1], the domain\n\u03a9t \u2261 {z \u2208 Cn : \u03c1t (z) < 0} is smoothly bounded and strongly pseudoconvex.\nFinally, there is a c > 0 so that all the eigenvalues of the Levi form at any\nboundary point of any \u03a9t are not less than c.\nIt should be stressed that we do not conclude that the domains \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91\nare biholomorphic. This is impossible in the strongest sense-see [GRK] and\n[BSW]. We are only setting up a smooth deformation of one domain into the\nother. What is interesting about the proof is that we simultaneously Fornaessembed the two domains \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91 into a single strongly convex domain W ,\nperform the deformation in W , and then pull it back. Along the way, an uncountably infinite family of \u2202 problems must be solved.\n\n2\n\nProof of the Theorem\n\nAccording to the Fornaess embedding theorem [FOR], there is, for j = \u22121, 1, a\nstrongly convex domain Wj \u00dfCNj (with, in general Nj > > n), a neighborhood\nUj of \u03a9j , and a univalent holomorphic mapping \u03a6j : Uj \u2192 CNj with \u03a6j (\u03a9j )\u00dfWj ,\n\u03a6j (\u03a9j )\u00dfW j , \u03a6j (Uj \\ \u03a9j ) \u2286 CNj \\ W j , and so that \u03a6j (\u03a9j ) is transversal to \u2202Wj\nwhere they meet.\nWe may assume that N1 = N\u22121 . Let N = 2N1 + 1. Let \u03c6 : R \u2192 R be an\neven, strictly concave function so that\n(1) \u03c6(\u22121) = 0;\n(2) \u03c6(1) = 0;\n(3) \u03c6(0) = 1;\n(4) \u03c6 is strictly decreasing to \u2212\u221e on (0, \u221e);\n2\n\n\f(4) \u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (x) \u2265 K for some large positive K > 0 and all x \u2208 R.\nAlso let \u03bb : R \u2192 R be a smooth function satisfying\n1. \u03bb is smooth;\n2. 0 \u2264 \u03bb(x) \u2264 1 for all x;\n3. \u03bb(x) \u2261 0 when x \u2264 \u22121;\n4. \u03bb(x) \u2261 1 when x \u2265 1;\n5. \u03bb is monotone increasing for \u22121 < x < 1;\nLet \u03bc\u22121 be a defining function for W\u22121 and \u03bc1 a defining function for W1 .\nIf z \u2208 CN , then let us write\nz = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zN ) = (z \u2032 ; z \u2217 ) ,\nwhere\nz \u2032 = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zN1 )\nand\nz \u2217 = (zN1 +1 , zN1 +2 , . . . , zN ) .\nNow we consider in CN the domain with defining function\n\u03c1(z) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb(Re zN ))\u03bc\u22121 (z \u2032 ) + \u03bb(Re zN )\u03bc1 (z \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c6(|z \u2217 |2 ) .\nWe set\nW = {z \u2208 CN : \u03c1(z) < 0} .\nWe claim that, in a natural sense, \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91 are Fornaess-embedded into W .\nLet us see why.\nFirst, \u03c1 is strictly convex. The pure second derivatives of \u03c1 in z \u2032 are clearly\nunder control and positive. The pure second derivatives in z \u2217 are controlled by\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 provided that K is large enough. Also the mixed second derivatives are\ncontrolled by \u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 provided that K is large enough.\nSecond, \u03c1(z \u2032 ; (0, 0, . . . , \u22121 + 0i)) = \u03bc\u22121 (z \u2032 ) so that {z : z \u2217 = (0, 0, . . . , \u22121 +\n0i), \u03c1(z) < 0} is simply a copy of W\u22121 . And \u03c1(z \u2032 ; (0, 0, . . . , 1 + 0i)) = \u03bc1 (z \u2032 ), so\nthat {z : z \u2217 = (0, 0, . . . , 1 + 0i), \u03c1(z) < 0} is a copy of W1 . Thus\ne \u22121 (w) \u2261 (\u03a6\u22121 (w); (0, 0, . . . , \u22121 + 0i))\n\u03a6\n\nembeds \u03a9\u22121 into W . And\n\ne 1 (w) \u2261 (\u03a61 (w); (0, 0, . . . , 1 + 0i))\n\u03a6\n\nembeds \u03a91 into W . As a result, we have both \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91 embedded, in\nthe fashion of the Fornaess embedding theorem, into the single strongly convex\ndomain W .\n3\n\n\fAssume without loss of generality that 0 lies in W . Now we may define, for\nz \u2208 Cn , and \u22121 \u2264 t \u2264 1, a smooth function \u03c9(z, t) so that \u03c9(z, \u22121) is a defining\nfunction for W \u2229 {z : z \u2217 = (0, 0, . . . , \u22121 + 0i)}, \u03c9(z, 1) is a defining function for\nW \u2229 {z : z \u2217 = (0, 0, . . . , 1 + 0i)}, and, in general, \u03c9(z, t) is a defining function\nfor W \u2229 {z : z \u2217 = (0, 0, . . . , t + i0)}, \u22121 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Let St = {z \u2208 W : z \u2217 =\n(0, 0, . . . , t + 0i)}. Then, for t near \u22121, we may map S\u22121 to St by sending a\npoint z in S\u22121 that is distance \u03b4 from the boundary to a point zet in St that\nis distance \u03b4 from the boundary and so that the line through the origin and\nzet has the same projection to the set {z \u2217 = 0} as the line through the origin\nand z. This is a smooth mapping for z near the boundary, and we may easily\ninterpolate it to a smooth mapping on all of S\u22121 . Call the mapping \u03c0t . Then,\ne \u22121 is the Fornaess embedding of \u03a9\u22121 into S\u22121 and \u03a6\ne \u22121 its inverse defined\nif \u03a6\n\u22121\ne \u22121 , then we have a pseudo-inverse-embedding \u03a6\ne \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 of\non the image of \u03a6\nt\n\u22121\nn\nSt into C . We call this a pseudo-inverse-embedding because it will not be\nholomorphic. But we can solve the \u2202 equation (see [HEN] and [SIU])\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121\n\u22121\ne\n\u2202h = \u2212\u2202 \u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0t\n\nto find a function h (which will have small C 2 norm because \u2202\u03c0t\u22121 has small\ne \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 + h is a holomorphic embedding of St into\nC 2 norm) so that \u03c4t \u2261 \u03a6\nt\n\u22121\nCn . We think of the image of \u03c4t as a perturbation \u03a9t of \u03a9\u22121 . We can continue\nto incrementally increase the value of t and create additional deformations of\n\u03a9\u22121 as t increases. Note here that it is propitious to use the Henkin solution of\nthe \u2202 problem-see [HEN]. For it is known [GRK] to provide smoothly varying\nsolutions when the data is varied smoothly.\nAt the same time, we could begin at \u03a91 and deform in the same fashion,\ndecreasing values of t. This incrementally creates deformations of \u03a91 . When\nthe values of t from above and the values of t from below meet (say at t = 0),\nthey must of course have data sets St that are close together in the smooth\ntopology. So the deformations constructed in Cn will also be close together. In\nsum, the two streams of deformed domains give rise to a deformation of \u03a9\u22121 to\n\u03a91 . Finally, it is clear by inspection that the eigenvalues of the Levi form for\n\u03a9t are pullbacks of eigenvalues of the Levi form for W . So the eigenvalues of\nthe Levi form for all the \u03a9t are uniformly bounded from 0.\n\n3\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIt would be a matter of some interest to solve the problem treated here in the\nalgebraic category: If \u03a9\u22121 and \u03a91 are bounded domains in Cn with strongly\npseudoconvex, algebraic boundaries, then can one be deformed into the other\nwith all intermediate domains being algebraic and strongly pseudoconvex? Likewise, one would like to solve this problem in the real analytic category: If \u03a9\u22121\nand \u03a91 are bounded domains in Cn with strongly pseudoconvex, real analytic\nboundaries, then can one be deformed into the other with all intermediate do4\n\n\fmains being real analytic and strongly pseudoconvex? Unfortunately the methods of the present paper cannot be applied to either of these problems. Our\nconstructions are strictly real-variable in nature. The methods used in Grauert's\nsolution of the Levi problem, and in his embedding theorem for real analytic\nmanifolds (see [GRA]), may be useful in studying some of these new questions.\nIt also would be worthwhile to study these deformation questions for other\ntypes of domains, such as pseudoconvex, finite type domains. Certainly the\nFornaess embedding theorem is not true for such domains, and we do not know\nhow to attack such a problem at this time.\nWe hope to explore these new questions in a future paper.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n\n[BSW] D.
