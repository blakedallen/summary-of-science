Density \u03c1 is set to zero (the\nJeans swindle) to derive a critical (Jeans) length scale\n\nL J = VS / ( !G ) , where VS is sound speed and G is\n1/ 2\n\nNewton's gravitational constant, interpreted by Jeans\nand astrophysicists (e.g. Springel et al. 2005) as the\nonly gravitational stability criterion forbidding\ngravitational structures at scales smaller than L J . Sir\nJames Jeans (1929) claimed observational support for\nhis theory is provided by spiral galaxies. He assumed\nhot gas from a (mysterious) central spinning source\ncollapses to stars in such galaxies only when chilled\nby the coldness of space, thus reducing L J .\nThis evidence weakened as better telescopes showed\nthe \"stars\" observed were globular star clusters (GCs)\ncontaining millions of stars. Observational and\ntheoretical support for a central gas source in spiral\n\ngalaxies failed to materialize. Modern fluid mechanics\nrequires additional gravitational structure formation\ncriteria. When viscosity, diffusion and turbulence are\nincluded in the analysis, a hydro-gravitationaldynamics (HGD) cosmology emerges that is in better\nagreement with recent observations of the early\nuniverse than CDM scenarios that assume collisionless\nfluids (Gibson 1996, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2006).\nFrom HGD cosmology (Figure 1), proto-galaxies and\nproto-galaxy-clusters\nformed\nby\ngravitational\nfragmentation of plasma at the Schwarz viscous scale\n\nL SV = ( !\" / #G ) , where \u03b3 is the rate-of-strain, \u03bd is\n1/ 2\n\nthe kinematic viscosity, \u03c1 is the density, and G is\nNewton's constant, preserving various parameters of\nthese irreversible transitions as fluid mechanical\nfossils.\n\n2.\n\nDILEMMAS OF JEANS' THEORY\n\nThe Jeans criterion presents major dilemmas for hot\nbig bang cosmology in an expanding universe. In the\nH-He plasma epoch, the Jeans scale of the plasma L J\nalways exceeds the \"horizon\" scale of causal\nconnection L H = ct because the enormous sound\n\n\fJournal of Applied Fluid Mechanics\n\nspeed VS = c / 3\n\n1/ 2\n\nis of order the speed of light c,\n\nwhere t is the time, so plasma structures are\nforbidden. The primordial gas at transition has a\nJeans mass of a million stars ( M J = 1036 kg),\n0\n\nt = 10 s (300,000 years), and T0 = 4000 K.\n13\n\nThe Jeans mass M J = M J\n\n0\n\n(T / T )\n0\n\n3/2\n\n! / ! 0 from the\n\nJeans criterion, so the first stars are large and\nexplosive, Madau (2006), and can form only after a\n\"dark ages\" period of about 300 Myr (1016 s) to\npermit sufficient cooling and density decrease. These\nPopulation III superstars rapidly disintegrate as dusty\nclass II supernovas to re-ionize the gas and explain its\nabsence in absorption spectra from early quasars,\nMori and Umemura (2006). However, recent \u03b3-ray\nspectra from blazars refute the intense high-energy\nstarlight expected, Aharonian et al. (2006). The\nintergalactic medium is free of any high density of\nPop-III photons that would scatter blazar \u03b3-rays by\npair production. Chemical searches also fail to\ndetect the large amounts of stardust Pop-III superstars\nwould have produced had they existed.\n\n3.\n\nHGD COSMOLOGY\n\nAfter the big bang and a fragmentational cascade to\nform protogalaxies (Fig. 1, Gibson 2006), HGD\ncosmology predicts primordial gas planets were the\nfirst collapsing gravitational objects. Superstars of\nCDM cosmology are not necessary to explain the\nmissing gas since it was sequestered as planets.\nSome of the planets gently formed larger planets and\nsmall stars in dark proto-globular-clusters (PGCs) of\ndense, dark, cooling proto-galaxies (PGs). Freezing\nweakly collisional PGC clumps expanded by\ndiffusion from PGs to form >1021 m galaxy halos of\nbaryonic dark matter (BDM), with diffusivity D ~\n1027 m2 s-1 calculated from L SD and the size and \u03c1 of\nthe halos.\nFlat rotation curves observed outside the 1020 m spiral\ngalaxy cores reflect this huge diffusivity. Luminous\n>1020 m accretion disks and spiral patterns of star\nformation in globular-star-clusters (GCs) reflect\ntorques developed in the chain-like morphology of\nthe proto-galaxy-clusters as they split into spiral\ngalaxies from the expansion of space. The tiny first\nstars still exist in GCs and dim proto-GCs that are\nbound by gravity and friction from the evaporated gas\nprovided by heating of their trillion frozen gas\nplanets.\n\n4.\n\nCDM COSMOLOGY\n\nOrthodox collisionless cosmology explains galaxy\nand galaxy cluster formation using \"cold dark matter\"\n(CDM): a postulated non-baryonic fluid of\ncollisionless massive particles produced during the\nnucleosynthesis epoch with particle velocity\n\n2\n\nvCDM < c . Based on Jeans theory and collisionless Nbody simulations, it is assumed deus ex machina,\nBinney & Tremaine (1987), that gravitationally bound\nCDM chunks form and merge gravitationally like\npoint mass N-bodies are forced to do in computer\nsimulations. Large mergers (\"halos\") of CDM chunks\nthen serve as growing baryon bottles that guide the\ngravitational formation of larger structures by\nhierarchical clustering (CDMHC) for 300 Myr dark\nages without stars and billions of years without\ngalaxies or galaxy clusters.\nPop-III superstars form as the gas cools by radiation\nand promptly explode in the merging CDM-halos,\nMori et al. (2004). Jupiter mass gas planets are ruled\nout by the Jeans criterion because they require an\nimpossible cooling of their H-He gas to 0.004 K to\npermit Jeans instability. However, Jovian planets\ncircling the sun in outer orbits and now detected in\ngreat multitudes in tight orbits around other stars,\nLovis et al. (2006), contradict the Jeans acoustic\ncriterion and support the basic tenet of HGD that all\nthe hot gas after transition fragments into dense PGC\nglobular star cluster mass clouds of Earth mass PFP\nprimordial fog particles.\nHow can the postulated CDM chunks remain\ngravitationally bound and merge to form larger\nchunks? Because fundamental particles of CDM are\nassumed to be collisionless and the chunks are not\npoint masses but must occupy finite volumes, CDM\nchunks have no physical mechanisms to stick to each\nother on collision or resist tidal forces\n\nFTIDAL = d CDM GmCDM M CDM / r , where\n3\n\ndiameter of CDM chunks of mass\n\ndCDM is the\nmCDM attracted by\n\na larger chunk of mass M CDM at distance r.\nThe tidal distortion xTIDAL per free fall oscillation is\n\nxTIDAL / d CDM = ( t / ! )\n\n2\n\n(D\n\n/ r ) M CDM / 2mCDM > 1 .\n3\n\nCDM\n\nSmall mCDM << M CDM chunks are torn to smaller and\nsmaller masses\n\nmCDM ! mCDM \" particle\n\nby any larger\n\nmasses M\nin a few free fall times ! = ( \"G )\n(Figure 2), contradicting the hierarchical merging\nprocess postulated in CDM cosmology. Chunks of\nCDM of any size will not remain gravitationally bound\nbut will expand indefinitely by diffusion.\nThe\nCDMHC hypothesis is therefore false. Observations\nshow no galaxies with cusp-like central concentrations\nof density reflecting the collisionless core collapse\nexpected for CDM halos of CDM chunks.\n#1 / 2\n\nCDM\n\nGravitationally bound CDM chunks are claimed\n(Binney & Tremaine 1987, chapter 4) to have large\nstability periods ! CDM = ! N / ln N much longer than\n\u03c4 if N is large, where N is the number of CDM\n\n\fJournal of Applied Fluid Mechanics\n\n3\n\nparticles. The claim is unwarranted. Any collection\nof collisionless particles with any velocities will grow\nin size indefinitely by diffusion. Assume a spherical\nCDM-chunk initially with perfectly cold, motionless,\nparticles. All particles fall toward the center of the\nsphere arriving at time t ! \" as the density of the\nshrinking sphere rapidly increases, the collisionless\nassumption fails, the particles exchange momentum\nand energy, and diffusion increases the size of the\n\n(\n\nchunk to a scale L SD = D / !G\n2\n\n)\n\n1/ 4\n\nlarger than its\n\ninitial size (Figure 3). The free fall time \u03c4 increases\nas the CDM-chunk size increases.\nGalaxies of stars in apparent virial equilibrium are\nclaimed, Binney & Tremaine (1987), as prime\nexamples\nof\npermanent\n( ! galaxy ! ! N / ln N )\ngravitationally-bound\ncollisionless\nsystems.\nHowever, stars are actually not collisionless because\non average 30 million planets surround each star as\nthe interstellar medium from which stars are formed.\nThe planets supply gas and friction in response to any\nrapid relative motions, and reveal themselves as\ncontrails of stars (as in the Tadpole, Mice, and\nAntenna systems) formed in galaxy baryonic dark\nmatter halos when galaxies frictionally merge, Gibson\n& Schild (2003), Gibson (2006).\nSchild (1996) has shown by observations of quasar\nmicrolensing twinkling frequencies that the lensing\ngalaxy mass is dominated not by stars but by planets,\nwhich he proposed as the galaxy missing mass.\nNumerous claims that the collisionless tidal tails of\ncomputer simulations of galaxy mergers have been\nobserved in nature are therefore false. Star trails\nbetween merging and separating galaxies are never\ncollisionless tidal tails but evidence of galaxies\ntriggering star formation as they move through each\nother's highly combustible BDM halos.\nDiffusivity D = Lv in a gas is mean free path\nL MFP = m particle / ! gas \" collision times the particle velocity\n\nv particle ,\n\nso whatever fundamental particle emerges\n\nas that of the unknown non-baryonic dark matter\n(NBDM) will certainly have a very large L MFP and\nlarge diffusivity DNBDM\n\nsince the collision cross\n!40\n\nsectional area !

Fossil turbulence* from inflation preserves\npatterns of the big bang turbulence, Gibson (2004).\nOnly viscous and turbulence forces were relevant in\nthe primordial plasma until buoyancy forces of the\nfirst self-gravitational structures (at 1012 s) appeared to\ninhibit large scale turbulence\u2020 and to preserve the\nplasma density (\u03c10 ~3 ! 10-17 kg m-3) and rate-of-strain\n(\u03b30 ~10-12 rad s-1) as fossils of the turbulence.\nDiffusion dominates gravity for the NBDM in the\nplasma epoch since L SD > L H = ct during this period.\nCoupling to the plasma ceased soon after 1011 s.\nCondensation on density maxima was inhibited by the\nrapid expansion rate of the early universe, so the first\ngravitational structures were formed by fragmentation\nat density minima when the viscous Schwarz scale\n\nL SV = ( !\" / #G )\n\n1/ 2\n\n> LH\n\ndecreased\n\nto\n\nless than\n\n12\n\nL H = ct at 10 s, forming voids and clouds of plasma\nwhen viscous forces matched those of gravity, where\n! 0 ! 1 / t 0 is the rate of strain (10-12 s-1) and \u03bd is the\nkinematic viscosity (4 ! 1026 m2 s-1).\nSubstituting these values gives L SV !

The\n\nresulting protogalaxy morphology to be expected\nfrom HGD is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe Schwarz viscous scale of the 4000 K hot gas at\n1013 s was about 1014 m giving a small-planet mass of\n1024-25 kg. Simultaneous fragmentations at 1036 kg\nwere from radiative heat transfer density changes at\nthe Jeans scale L J , but not by the Jeans 1902\nmechanism. The viscous dissipation rate \u03b5 was a very\ngentle ~10-12 m2 s-3.\nGravitational condensation of matter first began in the\nuniverse as planetary cloud collapse with\n\n! 0 = ( \"0 G )\n\n#1 / 2\n\nin proto-globular-clusters (PGCs).\n\nThe collapse time ! 0 was 3 ! 1013 s (600,000 years)\nwhich is also the time to first star formation in the\ntidally agitated PGC cores near protogalaxy centers,\nnot the 300 million dark ages years (1016 s) predicted\nby CDMHC after assembly of CDM halos and\ncooling of the gas to permit the first stars as\nPopulation III superstars by the Jeans criterion.\n\nStars form from planets that fragmented in 1036 kg\nclumps immediately after the plasma to gas transition.\nThe high 1012 s baryonic density is preserved as that of\nglobular star clusters. Gentle motions prevailing at the\n1013 s time of first stars made possible their small\nsizes. The interstellar medium and the baryonic dark\nmatter are proto-globular-star-clusters of frozen small\nplanets, as predicted by HGD cosmology and observed\nby quasar microlensing.\nCDM hierarchical clustering cosmology gives\ngravitationally bound structures forming first at small\nscales and clustering by impossible fluid mechanics.\nThese structures gradually form stars that are much too\nlarge and too late, and that explode to form light that is\nfound not to exist. Galaxies and galaxy clusters are\nobserved at times earlier than predicted by CDMHC\ncosmology, but as expected from HGD cosmology.\n\nREFERENCES\nAharonian, F. et al. (2006).
