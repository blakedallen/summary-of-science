INTRODUCTION\n\nThe aim of this article is to find the macroscopical expression of the energy-momentum tensor of a free scalar field\nderived from Quantum Field Theory (QFT) up to the first quantum order in the WKB expansion, and to study its\nmacroscopical behavior. In previous works we established the relation among QFT variables -amplitudes and phaseswith macroscopic fluid variables -proper energy and four-velocity- but considering only the lowest order in h\u0304 in the\nscheme of general curved space-times, in Riemannian and non-Riemannian geometries. In both cases, free scalar\nmatter corresponds to perfect fluids without pressure following geodesics[1, 2]. In fact, this statement also holds\nfor flat Minkowski space-time where geodesics must be understood as straight non-accelerated trajectories (inertial\nprinciple). In the present article we prove that up to the following order, free scalar fields correspond to perfect fluids\nwith pressure. We also find the corresponding law of motion which shows dispersions from inertial motion. Up to\nour knowledge, these are new results which give a deeper insight in the relation between second quantization and\nstandard description of macroscopical matter. We believe that these results contribute to place QFT as the ultimate\ndescription of matter structure.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section II we expand the energy-momentum tensor of the free scalar field. In\nsection III, we find the relation between microscopical and macroscopical variables and prove that free scalar matter\nmust be represented by a perfect fluid with pressure when quantum corrections are taken into account. In IV we find\nthe equation which relates the WKB amplitudes that are involved in the corresponding definitions of proper energy\ndensities and pressures; this section is also devoted to find the first quantum correction to the classical equations of\nmotion. Finally, in V, we make a summary of our results.\nII. THE WKB EXPANSION OF THE ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR\n\nIn order to study the relationship between quantum and classical dynamics, we start considering the complex wave\nfunction \u03a8 in terms of the path integral formalism. In the first quantization scheme, the wave function of the particle\nmay be expressed as:\nZ\n\u03a8(xo , xf ) = N eiScl [x]/h\u0304 Dx\n(1)\nwhere Scl [x] is the classical action which is a functional of the trajectory x(t) depending on the initial and final fixed\ndata (xo , xf ) and N is a normalization factor. If Scl is the action of a non-relativistic particle, then \u03a8 corresponds to a\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nFellow of the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) - levinas@iafe.uba.ar\nFellow of the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) - levinas@iafe.uba.ar\n\n1\n\n\fwave function which satisfies the Schroedinger equation [3]. On the other hand, when we work in the scheme of second\nquantization, \u03a8 must be taken to be a field satisfying the relativistic field equation obtained for the corresponding\nrepresentation of the Lorentz group. Field equations arise minimizing action S[\u03a8] with respect to the field:\n\u03b4S[\u03a8]\n=0\n\u03b4\u03a8\n\n(2)\n\nThe expansion of eq. (1) in powers of h\u0304 reads:\nZ R\nX\n1\niScl [xcl ]/h\u0304\n(\u2212ih\u0304)n \u03a8n eiScl /h\u0304\n\u03a8 = Ne\ne 2 \u03b4Scl [x]/\u03b4x1 \u03b4x2 Dx1 Dx2 +... Dx =\n\n(3)\n\nn=0\n\nwith xcl the classical trajectory. This expression is known as the WKB expansion. For any group representation, this\nexpansion means that:\nS[\u03a8] = Scl [x] + O(h\u0304)\n\n(4)\n\nSo, the h\u0304 = 0 limit of S[\u03a8] in a first quantization scheme leads to Scl [x], in the same way as the h\u0304 = 0 limit of the\neffective action conduces, in a second quantization scheme, to S[\u03a8].\nWe are interested in analyzing the case of a complex scalar field \u03a6. Its action reads:\nZ\nZ\n1 \u03bc\nm2\n4\nS[\u03a8] = L(\u03a6, \u2202\u03a6) d x=\n(\u2202 \u03a6\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2217 + 2 \u03a6\u03a6\u2217 ) d4 x\n(5)\n2\nh\u0304\nThe corresponding energy-momentum tensor is:\nT \u03bc\u03bd \u2261\n\n\u2202L \u03bd \u2217\n\u2202L \u03bd\n\u2202 \u03a6 \u2212 L\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202 \u03a6+\n\u2202\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\n\u2202\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2217\n\n(6)\n\nwhich conduces to:\n1\nm2\n1\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 (\u03bc \u03a6\u2202 \u03bd) \u03a6\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb \u03a6\u2202\u03bb \u03a6\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd 2 \u03a6\u03a6\u2217\n2\n2\nh\u0304\nThe WKB expansion (3) for the scalar field reads:\nX\n\u03a6=\n(\u2212ih\u0304)n \u03c6n eiScl /h\u0304\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nn=0\n\nNow, using expansion (8) in expression (7), and after a straightforward computation, we find that up\nto order 1/h\u0304, the energy momentum tensor can be written as:\nT \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1 \u03bc\n\u2202 S\u2202 \u03bd S\u03c6o \u03c6\u2217o\nh\u03042\n\n+ h\u03041 {\u2202 (\u03bc S Im(\u03c6o \u2202 \u03bd) \u03c6\u2217o ) \u2212 2\u2202 \u03bc S\u2202 \u03bd S Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u22171 )+\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd [(\u2202 \u03bb S\u2202\u03bb S) Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u22171 ) + (\u2202 \u03bb S) Im(\u03c6o \u2202\u03bb \u03c6\u2217o ) + m2 Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u22171 )]}\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Scl = S, and Im means \"imaginary part\". It is easy to verify that this symmetric quantity is\nconserved, i.e. satisfies:\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\fIII. THE SCALAR FIELD AS A PERFECT FLUID\n\nLet us analyze the h\u0304\u22122 order (the first term) of expression (9). We may write the corresponding term\nas\n2\n\nT (1/h\u0304\n\n)\u03bc\u03bd\n\n= \u03c1\u0302u\u03bc u\u03bd\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nm2\n\u03c6o \u03c6\u2217o\nh\u03042\n\n(12)\n\nis the proper energy and u\u03bc is the timelike vector orthogonal to the hypersurface of constant phase S,\nwhere \u2202\u03bc S = P \u03bc and S is understood as the Hamilton principal function. In the free case, canonical\nmomentum P \u03bc coincides with the ordinary momentum p\u03bc , i.e.:\nP \u03bc = p\u03bc = mu\u03bc\n\n(13)\n2\n\nFour-velocity u\u03bc satisfies u\u03bc u\u03bc = \u22121. Relation (11) shows that T (1/h\u0304 )\u03bc\u03bd is nothing but the energymomentum tensor of a dust.\nUsing (13) in (9) we are able to write the energy-momentum tensor showing explicitly the four-velocity\ncomponents:\nT \u03bc\u03bd =\n\nm2\nm (\u03bc\n\u03bd) \u2217\n\u2217 \u03bc \u03bd\n2 \u03c6o \u03c6o u u \u2212 2 h\u0304 u Im(\u03c6o \u2202 \u03c6o )\nh\u0304\nm2 \u03bc \u03bd\nm\n\u22122\nu u Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u22171 ) \u2212 u\u03bb Im(\u2202\u03bb \u03c6o * \u03c6\u2217o )\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\n\n(14)\n\nFrom (14) we can see that at a point where the observer is at rest (proper observer), i.e.: \u0169\u03bc =\n(\u22121, 0, 0, 0), the components of T \u03bc\u03bd , which we denote as T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd , are:\nT\u0303 oo =\n\nm\nm2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2 \u03c6o \u03c6o \u2212 h\u0304 [2m Im(\u03c6o \u03c61 ) + Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u0307o )]\nh\u0304\n\nT\u0303 ij =\n\n(15)\n\nT\u0303 oi = 0\n\n(16)\n\nm\nIm(\u03c6o \u03c6\u0307\u2217o ) \u03b4 ij\nh\u0304\n\n(17)\n\n(with i, j, ... = 1, 2, 3). This will be useful in order to find the general expression in any Lorentzian frame.\nOnce we have written the components of T \u03bc\u03bd , we see that it is possible to define:\n\u03c1=\n\nm\nm2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2 \u03c6o \u03c6o \u2212 h\u0304 [2m Im(\u03c6o \u03c61 ) + Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u0307o )] \u2261 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0306\nh\u0304\n\n(18)\n\nm\nIm(\u03c6o \u03c6\u0307\u2217o )\nh\u0304\n\n(19)\n\np=\n\nwhich are the proper energy density and the pressure, respectively. Here * \u2261 d/d\u03c4 , \u03c4 being the proper\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bc\u03bd\ntime, \u03c1\u0302 is given by (12) while \u03c1\u0306 is \u03c1\u0306 = m\nread:\nh\u0304 [2m Im(\u03c6o \u03c61 )+Im(\u03c6o \u03c6\u0307o )]. So, the components of T\u0303\nT\u0303 oo = \u03c1\n\n(20)\n\nT\u0303 oi = 0\n\n(21)\n\nT\u0303 ij = p \u03b4 ij\n\n(22)\n\n3\n\n\fExpressions (20-22) represent the fluid that a proper observer would describe as isotropic, i.e. a perfect\nfluid.\nNow we want to generalize expressions (20-22) from this system to any Lorentz frame. To do this we\nanalyze how T \u03bc\u03bd may be 'measured ' in a reference frame at rest in the laboratory supposing that the\nfluid appears to be moving at each space-time point with velocity v i . This velocity is related to the spatial\ncomponents of the four velocity ui of the fluid via:\nv i = \u03b3 \u22121 * ui\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 v\u0304 2 /c2 )\u22121/2 is the boost that transforms Lorentz reference frames among them. Applying\nthis boost to components (20-22) of T \u03bc\u03bd , we obtain:\nT oo = (\u03c1 + pv\u0304 2 )\u03b3 2\n\n(23)\n\nT oi = (\u03c1 + p)v i \u03b3 2\n\n(24)\n\nT ij = p\u03b4 ij + (\u03c1 + p)v i v j \u03b3 2\n\n(25)\n\nwith \u03c1 and p given by (18) and (19), respectively.\nCombining (23), (24) and (25), we see that in any Lorentz frame, expression (14) reads:\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1u\u03bc u\u03bd + p(\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd )\n\n(26)\n\ni.e.: a perfect fluid. In conclusion: expression (9) for T \u03bc\u03bd which is given by QFT, corresponds to a perfect\nfluid that can be written only in terms of macroscopical variables.\nIn order to connect proper energy density and pressure we would only need an equation of state.\nThe structure of this equation depends on the properties of the system. In the particular case in which\ntemperature is an independent variable, pressure is a function of \u03c1o and \u03a0:\np = p(\u03c1o , \u03a0)\n\n(27)\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1o (1 + \u03a0)\n\n(28)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c1o being the proper mass density and the product \u03c1o. \u03a0, the internal energy density.\nIV. RELATION BETWEEN THE WKB AMPLITUDES AND EQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nIn QFT, field equations are obtained minimizing the effective action with respect to the field (equation (2)). For\nthe scalar representation \u03a6, this conduces to the Klein-Gordon equation:\n\u2737\u03a6 +\n\nm2\n\u03a6=0\nh\u03042\n\n(29)\n\nwhich in terms of the WKB expansion of the field, reads:\nX\nX\n[h\u03042 \u2737\u03c6n + ih\u0304(2\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6n \u2202\u03bc S + \u03c6n \u2737S) \u2212 \u03c6n \u2202 \u03bc S\u2202\u03bc S)(\u2212ih\u0304)n ] = \u2212\nm2 \u03c6n (\u2212ih\u0304)n\nn\n\n(30)\n\nn\n\nAssuming that (30) must be satisfied order by order in h\u0304, we obtain the differential equations which\nare needed to describe the perfect fluid via eqs. (18) and (19):\n\u2202 \u03bc S\u2202\u03bc S + m2 = 0\n\n(31)\n\n2i\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6o \u2202\u03bc S + i\u03c6o \u2737S + \u03c61 (\u2737S + m2 ) = 0\n\n(32)\n\nn=0\nn=1\n\nEquation (31) provides no new information: it is trivially satisfied because \u2202 \u03bc S = P \u03bc = mu\u03bc and\nu\u03bc u\u03bc = \u22121. Equation (32) may be written as:\n2u\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6o + (\u03c6o \u2212 i\u03c61 )\u2202\u03bc u\u03bc \u2212 im\u03c61 = 0\nand relates the first two amplitudes of the WKB expansion of the field.\n4\n\n(33)\n\n\fIn order to find the equations of motion corresponding to scalar particles, we compute equation (10) using (19) and\nobtain:\n\u2202 \u03bc P + \u2202\u03bd [(\u03c1 + P )u\u03bc u\u03bd ] = 0\n\n(34)\n\nKeeping only those equations corresponding to the spatial components of the velocity v\u0304, we find the following\nvectorial equation:\n(\u03c1 + P ) * [\n\n\u2202v\u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304 + v\u0304 \u2202P ]\n+ (v\u0304 * \u2207)v\u0304]\n= \u2212\u03b3 \u22122 [\u2207P\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(35)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that ui = v i *uo . In eq. (35), different orders in 1/h\u0304n are involved due to the corresponding\nexpressions of \u03c1 and P (see (18) and (19)). So, for the first two orders, we obtain two equalities. Up to the 1/h\u03042\n(main) contribution we have :\n\u2202v\u0304\n \u0304 =0\n+ (v\u0304 * \u2207)v\u0304\n\u2202t\n\n(36)\n\nTaking into account the 1/h\u0304 correction, eq. (36) becomes:\n(\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0306 + P ) * [\n\n\u2202v\u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304 + v\u0304 \u2202P ]\n+ (v\u0304 * \u2207)v\u0304]\n= \u2212\u03b3 \u22122 [\u2207P\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(37)\n\nThe first equation tells us that, at the highest order in the WKB expansion, the free massive scalar field is represented\nby particles with null acceleration, i.e., their trajectories are straight lines. This is the classical limit of the approach\nand represents the inertial principle. But we can see from eq. (37) that quantum corrections to the straight line\nappear at the next order. That is to say: free matter follows trajectories that deviate from straight lines and from\nnon-accelerated uniform motion.\nWe want to recall that equation (37) may be considered the relativistic second law of Newton: F \u03bc = m * du\u03bc /d\u03c4 ,\nwhere quantum corrections to \u03c1 and the appearance of P (expressions (18) and (19) respectively), are responsible\nfor deviations from straight lines with no need of external forces nor of quantum potentials (as, for example, in the\nBohm's scheme; see[4]). Equation (37) reveals the nature of the internal structure of matter and how it acts in order\nto produce quantum effects.\nV. SUMMARY\n\nWe have developed the WKB expansion of the scalar field up to the first quantum correction and studied the\nrelations between QFT description of matter and macroscopic fluids. Our aim was to find the behaviour of this\nmatter in a macroscopical picture, asumming quantum corrections. Our main results are the following:\n- at the first quantum approximation, free scalar fields correspond to perfect fluids with pressure,\n- the corresponding law of motion implies deviations from straight unaccelerated motion.\n\nVI.
