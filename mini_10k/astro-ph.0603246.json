INTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-resolution X-ray observations of galaxy clusters with\nthe Chandra satellite revealed a number of interesting and unexpected features in the intracluster medium (ICM). Many\nclusters were found to exhibit sharp, arc-shaped, edge-like\njumps in their gas density and temperature. Unlike in shock\nfronts, the gas on the dense side of these \"cold fronts\" is\ncooler, so the pressure is continuous across the front (e.g.,\nMarkevitch et al. 2000; Vikhlinin et al. 2001). Cold fronts are\nmuch more ubiquitous than shock fronts; only two convincing examples of the latter have been found so far (1E 0657\u201356\nand A520), while cold fronts are observed in many if not most\nclusters. In merging systems, they were immediately interpreted as contact discontinuities between gases from different\nsubclusters (Markevitch et al. 2000). In some cases, such as\nthe cluster 1E 0657\u201356 or the galaxy NGC 1404, this is quite\nobvious from the X-ray and optical images which show that\nthe cold front is a boundary of the cool gas belonging to the\ninfalling subcluster (e.g., Markevitch et al. 2002; Machacek\net al. 2005). However, cold fronts are also observed near the\ncenters of cooling flow3 clusters, many of which are relaxed\nand show little or no signs of recent merging (e.g., Mazzotta et\nal. 2001; Markevitch et al. 2001, 2003; Churazov et al. 2003;\nDupke & White 2003; Sanders et al. 2005). These fronts are\ntypically more subtle in terms of the density jump than those\nin mergers. Some of the examples are shown in Fig. 1; one\nof them is in A2029, which on scales r > 100 \u2212 200 kpc is\nthe most relaxed cluster known (e.g., Buote & Tsai 1996).\n1 Presently at the Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, An der Sternwarte\n16, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; yago@aip.de\n2 Also Space Research Institute, Russian Acad. Sci., Profsoyuznaya 84/32,\nMoscow 117997, Russia\n3 For the purpose of this work, we will use the term \"cooling flow\" simply\nto denote the observed centrally peaked gas density and temperature profiles,\nfully aware of the problems of the physical cooling flow model.\n\nIn these clusters, the moving gas clearly does not belong to\nany infalling subcluster. Markevitch et al. (2001) showed that\nthe gas forming the cold front in A1795, another very relaxed\ncluster, is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and proposed that the\nfront is caused by subsonic \"sloshing\" of the cluster's own\ncentral gas in the gravitational potential well as a result of a\ndisturbance of the central potential by past subcluster infall,\nor a gas disturbance from the central AGN activity. It is important to establish the nature of these features, because they\nmay have significant effect on the energy balance in the cooling flows, as well as on estimates of the cluster total mass\nbased on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.\nIn this work, we wish to test whether gas sloshing in the\ncluster cores can create cold fronts and investigate the possible origin of such sloshing. We use high-resolution numerical\nsimulations of idealized cluster mergers to explore the possibility that such features are a long-lived consequence of the\ninfall of small subclusters. We will be particularly interested\nin determining whether it is possible for a merger to create\ncold fronts in the cool core, without significantly disturbing\nthe ICM as a whole.\nSeveral earlier works analyzed cluster mergers found in\ncosmological simulations and demonstrated that cold fronts\ncan indeed form as a result of ram-pressure stripping and\nsubsequent adiabatic expansion of the cold gas belonging\nto merging subclusters (Bialek et al. 2002; Nagai & Kravtsov\n2003; Mathis et al. 2005). Detailed effects of ram-pressure\nstripping on a substructure moving through the ICM have\nalso been studied using idealized 3D or 2D merger simulations (e.g. Heinz et al. 2003; Acreman et al. 2003; Asai et al.\n2004; Takizawa 2005, among others). Closer to the questions\nthat we wish to address here, Churazov et al. (2003) and Fujita et al. (2004) used 2D simulations to model a weak shock\nor acoustic wave propagating toward the cluster center. They\nfound that it can displace the cool gas from the gravitational\n\n\f2\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\nRXJ1720+26\n\nA2204\n\nA2029\n\nOphiuchus\n\nF IG . 1.- Archival Chandra X-ray images in a 0.5\u20134 keV energy band of examples of real clusters exhibiting cold fronts in their cool cores. Horizontal bars are\n100 kpc. A2029 (analyzed by Clarke et al. 2004) is among the most relaxed clusters known; it exhibits 2 edges in a spiral pattern at r \u223c 7 and 20 kpc (between\nwhite and pink and between light and dark pink), and possibly another one at smaller scale. RXJ1720+26 (Mazzotta et al. 2001) and A2204 (Sanders et al. 2005)\nare relaxed on large scales; RXJ1720+26 exhibits a large, r \u2248 250 kpc edge (pink - blue), while A2204 shows a spiral pattern consisting of least two edges at 20\nand 70 kpc (white - pink, pink - blue). Ophiuchus has some evidence in the outskirts of a recent merger. It shows three edges on scales r \u223c 3 kpc, 8 kpc and 40\nkpc (white - pink, white - darker pink, blue - darker blue).\n\npotential well and cause gas sloshing and cold fronts. On the\nother hand, Tittley & Henriksen (2005), using mergers extracted from a cosmological simulation, suggested that cold\nfronts in the cores can result from oscillations of the dark matter core caused by gravitational disturbance from a merging\nsubcluster. We will see that both of these processes are at\nwork.\nThe simulations presented in this paper improve on the earlier works in several important respects. First, we achieve\nmuch higher resolution, 5\u201310 kpc within the central r < 100\nkpc, sufficient to produce sharp cold fronts and comparable to\nthe resolution of the X-ray observations. Second, we use controlled mergers of idealized symmetric subclusters, spanning\na range of merger mass ratios and impact parameters, testing\n\nvarious dark matter and gas profiles as well as mergers where\nthe smaller subcluster has lost all its gas. This makes it easier\nto identify physical effects at play and separate them from the\neffects of random initial conditions in cosmological simulations. Most importantly, we use typical observed cluster gas\ndensity and temperature profiles as initial conditions, including the observed temperature decline in cluster centers, and\ndo not include radiative cooling. Current cosmological simulations, with or without cooling, cannot reproduce central\ncool regions of real clusters, even qualitatively. At the same\ntime, the steep gas entropy profile in the center turns out to be\nthe most important condition for the creation of cold fronts,\nso it is necessary to use realistic gas profiles for such simulations, as we do. We use a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n3\n\n(SPH) code, which lets us trace individual gas particles during\nthe merger. This opens several possibilities that are uniquely\ninteresting for our study - for example, we can see where\nthe gas in the cold front comes from, whose gas ends up in\nthe center of the final merged cluster, and what is the exact\nmechanism by which the initially continuous gas distribution\nevolves into a cold front.\n2. NUMERICAL METHOD\nAll our simulations have been accomplished with the parallel PMTree+SPH code G ADGET 2 (Springel 2005). Cosmological expansion has not been considered, and vacuum\nboundary conditions have been used. The simulation box size\nwas 300 Mpc. The total mass of the system, consisting of a\nT \u223c 10 keV galaxy cluster and an infalling group-sized substructure, is M = 1.7 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 in all the experiments. The\ngas mass fraction has been set to \u03a9gas /\u03a9dm = 0.04/0.3, which\nis the observed cluster value for H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (e.g.,\nVikhlinin et al. 2005). This corresponds to a total dark matter\n(DM) mass Mdm \u2261 M0 = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 and a total gas mass\nMgas = 2 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 . Our experiments involve N = 2 \u00d7 107\nparticles (107 DM particles and 107 gas particles), which\ntranslates into a mass resolution mdm = 1.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and\nmgas = 2 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . The gravitational softening length was set\nto 2 kpc, and SPH quantities are based on the nearest 64 particles. The resulting linear resolution (estimated as the distance\nto the 64-th neighbor) for our default cluster density profile is\n5 \u2212 10 kpc within r = 100 kpc for the main cluster (3\u2032\u2032 \u2212 6\u2032\u2032 at\nz = 0.1), widening to 25 kpc at r = 500 kpc. As we will see\nbelow (\u00a76), this is indeed the width of the sharpest features\nproduced by the simulations. Snapshots of the simulations\nhave been saved every 10 Myr.\nIn order to set up the initial conditions, we model both objects, the main cluster and the subhalo, at t = 0 as spherically\nsymmetric systems in hydrostatic equilibrium.

These model profiles are shown in Fig. 2. We will\nalso try a gas profile for the main cluster without a central\ntemperature drop, as well as a subcluster without gas.\nWe enforce the gas density, temperature and velocity to be\nsingle-valued (unlike collisionless dark matter, which may be\nmulti-streaming).

In the following, M1 and M2 denote the masses of the infalling satellite and\nthe main cluster, respectively (i.e. R \u2265 1). In order to scale\nthe initial profiles for various mass ratios of the subclusters,\nwe held M/a3 , c and ac /a constant.\nBoth objects start at a separation d = 3 Mpc, moving towards each other with an initial impact parameter b.

MERGER WITH A GASLESS SUBCLUSTER\n\nWe first consider a simple case (which will also turn out\nto be the most relevant), in which the infalling substructure\nis just a DM halo without any gas at all. This situation may\narise, for instance, if the satellite lost all its gas due to rampressure stripping during an earlier phase of the merger. As\n\nwe will see, such a merger does generate sloshing of the cool\ncentral gas and multiple cold fronts. Compared to a merger\nin which both subclusters have gas (considered in the next\nsection), the hydrodynamics in this case is relatively simple\nand the underlying processes can be identified more easily.\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of an encounter with R = 5\nand impact parameter b = 500 kpc. While mergers with such\nmassive subclusters may be relatively rare, this choice allows\nus to see the effects of the disturbance more clearly. For these\nmerger parameters, the first core passage of the satellite takes\nplace at about t \u2248 1.37 Gyr from the start of the simulation\nrun, at a distance approximately 150 kpc from the minimum\nof the gravitational potential. Different values of R and b lead\nto different orbits, with different time and length scales.

Symbols are spaced\nby 1 Gyr; the subhalo flyby occurs between 1\u20132 Gyr. (The DM peak relaxes\nto a position offset from its initial position in part because the subcluster loses\nits mass predominantly on one side of the cluster, which shifts the center of\nmass of the main cluster particles from that of the whole system.)\n\ncold fronts vary, but the qualitative behavior is similar. The\ncool gas peak is first displaced from the DM peak (around\nt = 1.6 Gyr in Fig. 3), then falls back and starts sloshing in\nthe minimum of the gravitational potential, generating cool\nedges. For b > 0, these edges create a characteristic longlived spiral structure. We will now look into each of these\nsteps in detail.\n3.1. Initial gas-DM displacement\nThere are two independent effects acting simultaneously to\nprovide initial separation of the cool gas from the DM peak\nduring the subcluster flyby. For the DM-only subcluster considered here, the more important effect is the gravitational disturbance that the subhalo creates around the moment of the\ncore passage. It causes the density peak of the main cluster\n(DM and gas together) to swing along a trajectory shown in\nFig. 4 relative to the center of mass of the main cluster, and\nconsequently, relative to the matter and gas surrounding the\npeak (that is, the matter approximately outside the distance of\nthe closest encounter, 150 kpc, which, for the most part, does\nnot participate in this swinging motion). The gas and DM\npeaks feel the same gravity force and start moving together toward the subcluster (t < 1.4 Gyr in Figs. 3 and 4). However,\nafter the core passage, the direction of this motion quickly\nchanges. For the gas peak, this leads to a change of sign of\nthe ram-pressure force - compare the gas velocity field outside the cool core in Fig. 3, at 1.43 Gyr and 1.6 Gyr, as well\nas the gas velocity profiles in Fig. 5 (solid lines). Between\nthese snapshots, the gas velocity around the core changes direction from downward (vy \u2248 \u2212200 km s\u22121 ) to upward (+200\nkm s\u22121 ; hereafter we will refer to the y > 0 and y < 0 directions as \"upward\" and \"downward\", respectively). As a result, the cool gas core, previously compressed by ram pressure\nfrom above, shoots up from the potential minimum in a kind\nof \"ram-pressure slingshot\" (proposed by Hallman & Markevitch 2004 for a cold front in A168). We will see this effect\n\n5\n\nmore clearly in simulations where the subcluster has gas (\u00a74).\nThere is another mechanism contributing to the initial gas\ndisplacement. Although the subcluster does not have any gas,\nit drags some of the main cluster's ICM in a trailing BondiHoyle wake (see e.g. Sakelliou 2000). The subcluster is supersonic at core passage (M \u2243 2), but the ICM disturbance that it\ncreates is sonic and the gas density is continuous, unlike that\nin a shock. This wake will become a weak shock after the\ncore passage, when it starts propagating outwards along the\ndeclining density profile. For the off-center merger considered here, this wake transfers some angular momentum from\nthe DM satellite to the ICM, resulting in large-scale rotation\nof the gas around the main cluster peak.\nWhen this disturbance reaches the central parts of the cluster, it acts to push the cold gas core out of equilibrium.\nThe thermal pressure profile along the vertical line passing\nthrough the DM peak is shown in Fig. 6 for different times\naround core passage. Before the wake reaches the center, one\ncan see the excess pressure from the wake above the cool core\n(at y \u2248 +200 kpc for t = 1.39 Gyr). The pressure difference\nchanges sign as the wake passes the core, so that at t = 1.5\nGyr, the pressure below the core (at y \u2248 \u2212100 kpc) is higher.\nThis is analogous to the sound wave disturbance proposed by\nChurazov et al. (2003) and Fujita et al. (2004) as a cause of\nthe initial core displacement. This change of the gas pressure\ndifference occurs at approximately the same time as the rampressure slingshot described above. The two effects combine\nto displace the cool gas peak upward (in the y > 0 direction)\nfrom the DM peak by about 15 kpc at t \u2243 1.6 Gyr (Fig. 5),\nwhile the outlying core gas is displaced to greater distances.\n(Note that because there is also a gas velocity change across\nthe wake, the two effects are not entirely independent.) Neither the passage of the wake through the core, nor the motion\nof the core, create any sharp temperature discontinuities until\nt \u2248 1.7 Gyr (Fig. 5), by which time the subcluster has moved\n1 Mpc away from the main peak.\n3.2. Onset of gas sloshing\nAfter the cool gas peak has been displaced from the potential minimum and the displacing force has diminished, the gas\nstarts falling back toward the center. The details of how this\nhappens can be seen in Fig. 7, which shows a zoomed-in view\nof the gas temperature and velocity field in the core at several\ninteresting moments. The outermost part of the displaced cool\ngas expands adiabatically as it is carried further out by the upward flow of the surrounding gas (the orange plume above the\ncenter in the 1.6\u20131.7 Gyr panels of Fig. 7). However, in a\nprocess not unlike the onset of a Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, the densest, coolest gas quickly starts sinking towards\nthe minimum of the gravitational potential, against ram pressure from the upward flow of the surrounding gas. This is\nseen most clearly in the 1.6 Gyr and 1.8 Gyr snapshots. At\n1.6 Gyr, the cool gas peak starts to flow downward toward\nthe DM center for the first time. By t = 1.7 Gyr, the cool gas\nhas overshot the center and, subjected to ram pressure from\nthe gas on the opposite (downward) side of the DM center\nstill moving upward, spreads into a characteristic mushroom\nstructure, behind which the cool gas continues to flow downward. At 1.8 Gyr, a new RT tongue develops on the inner side\nof the first mushroom head - the densest, lowest-entropy gas\nseparates and again starts flowing back toward the potential\nminimum. Meanwhile, the rest of the gas in the mushroom\nhead, and the gas with still higher entropy that by now has\nstarted to flow in from above (downward arrows in the or-\n\n\f6\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 5.- Profiles of the DM and gas density, gas temperature, and gas velocity, for the DM-only subcluster run (see Figs. 3 and 7). The quantities have been\ncomputed along a vertical line through the DM peak of the main cluster, which is also the frame of reference (y = 0, v = 0). Solid and dashed lines in the top\npanels represent gas and DM density, respectively. Solid lines in the velocity panels show the gas velocity along the y-axis, while dashed lines are used to plot\nthe horizontal component.\n\nange area in the 1.8 Gyr panel), continues to move outwards,\nexpanding adiabatically as it moves into the lower-pressure\nregions of the cluster. A snapshot later (1.9 Gyr panel), the\ncoolest gas on its way in (up) encounters ram pressure from\nthe hotter gas that by now has a significant downward velocity, and again develops a classic mushroom structure seen in\nmany hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Heinz et al. 2003; Takizawa 2005). The stem of the mushroom is the forward flow\nof the cool gas and the head is where it is slowed by ambient ram pressure and spread sideways, creating characteristic\neddies in the velocity field.\nEvery time the velocity of the densest, lowest-entropy gas\nis reversed w.r.t. that of the outer, higher-entropy gas in the\ncourse of the above RT-like process, the gas parcels with different entropies are quickly brought into contact, creating a\ncold front. The emergence of these discontinuities (at least\n\nat the resolution of our simulations) is clearly seen in the gas\ndensity and temperature cross-sections shown in Fig. 5. We\nwill discuss the precise mechanism by which the discontinuities arise in \u00a77.4.\nAs we see, immediately after the disturbance from the subcluster flyby, the cool central gas starts sloshing in the minimum of the gravitational potential, creating edge-like discontinuities on progressively smaller linear scales at each new\npassage through the center. Sloshing of the densest gas that is\nclosest to the center occurs with a smaller period and amplitude than that of the gas initially at greater radii. Note that the\noscillation of the DM peak caused by the subcluster flyby has\na much longer period (Fig. 4), of order 1 Gyr, than the 0.1 Gyr\ntimescale of gas sloshing. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 7, the DM\ndistribution in the core stays centrally symmetric, while the\ngas sloshes back and forth in its potential well. This is con-\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n7\n\nF IG . 6.- Gas pressure along a vertical line through the DM peak, for the DM-only subcluster run, showing the passage of a wake created by the subcluster.\n\ntrary to the picture proposed by Tittley & Henriksen (2005)\n(based on lower-resolution simulations) where the DM peak\noscillates back and forth and drags the gas peak along, exposing it to ram pressure. The DM peak motion is indeed\none of the two causes of the initial DM-gas decoupling (as\ndiscussed above in \u00a73.1), and in the long term, the DM oscillations should continue to feed kinetic energy to the sloshing\ngas. However, sloshing itself in our simulations is a hydrodynamic effect in a quasi-static central gravitational potential.\n3.3. The spiral structure\nAs mentioned above, the off-center flyby of the subcluster\ntransfers angular momentum to the gas near the core via the\ngas wake. When the cool gas is displaced from the center for\nthe first time, it acquires angular momentum from the gas in\nthe wake and does not fall back radially. As a result, the subsequent cold fronts are not exactly concentric (e.g., the 1.9\u2013\n2.1 Gyr panels in Fig. 7) but combine into a spiral pattern.\nInitially, this spiral pattern does not represent any coherent\nspiraling motion - each edge is an independent structure. In\nfact, the gas on the opposite ends of each edge flows in the\nopposite directions. However, as the time goes by and the linear scale of the structure grows, most clockwise motion (i.e.,\nthat against the average angular momentum of the outer gas)\nsubsides and the \"mushrooms\" become more and more lopsided (compare the 1.9 Gyr and 2.9 Gyr panels in Fig. 7). On\nlarge scales, the spiral does indeed become a largely coherent spiraling-in of cool gas - the mushroom stems, through\nwhich the low-entropy gas flows toward the mushroom cap,\nshift more and more to the edge of the cap. In the inner regions of the \"spiral\", there are still parts flowing in the opposite direction (e.g., at 2.9 Gyr).\nMeanwhile, the satellite proceeds on its orbit, reaching\napocenter at t \u2248 2.7 Gyr and r \u2248 1.7 Mpc, and falling back\nto the core at t \u2248 4 Gyr (Fig. 3). During all this time, cold\nfronts in the core are the only visible trace of the encounter.\n\nThe density and temperature contrasts across the cold fronts\ndecrease from a factor of 3 at t = 1.7 Gyr to about a factor\nof 2 at t = 2 Gyr and \u223c 1.5 at t = 3.8 Gyr. The cold fronts\ngenerated by the first flyby of the dark matter satellite survive\nits second passage, which generates new sloshing in the inner\npart (although less significant, because the satellite has lost\nsome of its mass). Temperature and density jumps at a 20%\nlevel remaining from the first encounter are still seen even at\nt = 6 Gyr, almost 5 Gyr after that encounter (this is, of course,\nacademic, since any real cluster will probably experience a\nfew more mergers during this period).\nOne interesting question that may arise from looking at the\nevolution of the spiral temperature structure (Figs. 3 and 7)\nis how the small initial displacement of the central cool gas\napparently succeeds in spreading this low-entropy gas out to\nlarge radii against convective stability in the radially increasing entropy profile. In fact, this is not the case. Figure 8\nshows the ratio of the radial distances of the gas particles at\npresent to their initial distances from the center of the undisturbed cluster. All cool structures are indeed comprised of\ngas that has moved away from the center. However, the amplitude of the radial change is diminishing with time. At 2\nGyr, sloshing displaces the gas along the radial coordinate by\nup to a factor of 3, while at 6 Gyr it is not more than a factor of\n1.5. That is, as expected, the gas that initially splashes out to\nlarge distances eventually settles back in the center. The cool\ngas that forms the large-scale cold fronts at later stages has\nnot come all the way from the center, but from only slightly\nsmaller radii (although possibly from the opposite side of the\ncluster). It expanded adiabatically, which enhanced the temperature contrast. While Figs. 3 and 7 show that each cold\nfront indeed starts near the center and expands continuously,\nthe gas at the front is not the same at every moment. As seen\nmost clearly in the 1.9\u20132.1 Gyr panels of Fig. 7, there is circulation inside the cold front, in which the lowest-entropy gas\n\n\f8\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n1.6 Gyr\n\n1.7 Gyr\n\n1.8 Gyr\n\n1.9 Gyr\n\n2.0 Gyr\n\n2.1 Gyr\n\nF IG . 7.- Zoomed-in gas temperature slices (color; blue is 2 keV, yellow is 7\u20139 keV) with DM density contours overlaid (log-spaced by factor of 2), for the\npure-DM subcluster run shown in Fig. 3.

Both r and r0 are relative to the DM peak of the main subcluster at the corresponding time. Panels\nare 1 Mpc in size, centered on the DM peak.\n\nand whose origin traces back to greater radial distances. Finally, the oscillation of the DM peak on a Gyr timescale relative to the bulk of the cluster gas also contributes to widening\nthe spiral pattern.\nWe note here that our conclusion about the longevity of the\nspiral structure may be affected by two numeric effects. As\nwill be discussed in \u00a76, the finite resolution and the artificial viscosity employed in the SPH code suppress small-scale\nturbulence that might disrupt the sharp features and mix the\ngas with different entropies (although this is not necessarily a\nproblem, because viscosity in real clusters is not known and\nmay be comparable). It also injects entropy into the gas wherever there is velocity shear, including at cold fronts. This entropy increase may make it slightly more difficult for that gas\nto sink back to the center. However, the origin and the nearterm evolution of the cold fronts should be reproduced qualitatively correctly.\n4. THE EFFECT OF SUBCLUSTER GAS\nIf the infalling subcluster has retained its gas, the picture\nis very different from that described in \u00a73. Figure 9 shows\na simulated encounter with the same parameters as the one\n\ndescribed in the previous sections (R = 5 and b = 500 kpc),\nbut now the infalling satellite has its own gas component. The\nmost important difference is that the gas of the subcluster now\ndisplaces the gas of the main cluster, creating a shock front -\na region of high-density, hot gas moving with the same velocity (M \u2248 2 at core passage in our fiducial setup), which should\nbe compared to a more subtle sonic wake that accompanied\nthe DM-only subcluster. The shock and the gas stripped from\nthe subcluster are now the dominant agents disturbing the gas\nat the main core, much more significant than the slow orbital\nmotion of the main DM peak. If the merger is head-on, they\ncan sweep the cool gas from the main cluster completely. As\nlong as the merger is off-center and the central gas survives\nthe shock passage, the gas starts sloshing in a process qualitatively similar to that seen in the DM-only subcluster run.\nThe 1.3\u20131.5 Gyr panels in Fig. 9, as well as the gas density and velocity profiles through the center plotted in Fig. 10,\nshow again the effect of a ram-pressure slingshot. To illustrate\nit more clearly, Fig. 11 shows profiles of the quantity which\napproximately represents ram pressure on the upper-right side\nof the main core, at several interesting moments of time. At\ncore passage (t = 1.35 Gyr), the ram pressure on the cool den-\n\n\f10\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 9.- Temperature slices for the same encounter as in Fig. 3 (R = 5, b = 500 kpc), but now the satellite that has its own gas component.

The profiles in Fig. 10 are derived along the white lines in these temperature plots.\n\nsity peak is at its maximum; it is strong enough to compress\nand displace much of the main core gas to the lower-left from\nthe DM peak (this displacement can be seen in the 1.39 Gyr\npanel in Fig. 9). As soon as the subcluster moves away, ram\npressure drops very quickly (although not monotonically, be-\n\ncause initially it is exerted by the shocked gas and then by the\nstripped subcluster gas, as can be understood from Fig. 11).\nThis causes the gas in the main core to rebound and overshoot\nthe DM peak. Around t = 1.5 \u2212 1.6 Gyr, there is an interesting additional effect - the rebounding dense core sticks out\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n11\n\nFig. 9. - continued\n\ninto the flow of the subcluster gas (see the 1.5 Gyr gas fraction panel in Fig. 9), making the subcluster ICM flow around\nit. This creates an \"airplane wing\" effect, additionally lifting\nthis gas up.\nThe first sharp cold front (Fig. 10) forms at t \u2248 1.5 Gyr\nas a result of this rebound motion. Compared to the DMonly subcluster run, the cold front forms earlier and on the\nopposite side from the core - because the initial gas-DM displacement is now caused by ram pressure from the subcluster,\nnot by the change in the direction of motion of the main DM\ncore as it was in \u00a73.1. This front separates the main cluster\nand the subcluster ICM. The tangential flow of the subcluster gas along its surface creates an eddy seen in the 1.67\u20131.9\nGyr panels of Fig. 9. Note that not just the cool gas from the\ncore, but the bulk of the main cluster gas, initially pushed to\nthe south by the subcluster flyby, rebounds and takes part in\nthe upward flow. However, the densest, coolest gas quickly\ndevelops a RT-like tongue (the 1.67 Gyr panel in Fig. 9) and\nstarts flowing back into the potential minimum (such cool filaments behind cold fronts were also seen in the simulations\nby Mathis et al. 2005). From this moment on, the picture is\nqualitatively similar to our DM-only subcluster run (\u00a73). This\ncool gas reaches the potential minimum and starts sloshing in\nit, generating mushroom-head cold fronts and RT tongues on\nsmaller and smaller scales, similar to Fig. 7. Inside each of\nthese mushroom heads, as well as inside the first \"slingshot\"\ncold front, the lowest-entropy gas is constantly flowing toward the DM peak along the RT-like tongues and is replaced\nat the cold front with the newly arrived, higher-entropy gas,\nas described in \u00a73.3. This allows the cold fronts to expand\noutward. Note that the \"slingshot\" cold front separates gases\nfrom the two merging subclusters, while the \"sloshing\" cold\nfronts in the center arise entirely within the ICM of the main\n\ncluster, as in \u00a73.\nThe \"slingshot\" cold front moves beyond r = 500 kpc approximately 1 Gyr after the core passage (where it still exhibits a factor of \u223c 2 density jump). Compared to the DMonly subcluster run, the initial disturbance was much stronger\nand the sloshing cold fronts evolve much faster. In addition,\nthe velocity field is more chaotic due to the eventual infall of\nthe gas stripped from the subcluster, which destroys most of\nthe central pattern of \"sloshing\" cold fronts in about 2 Gyr\n(the 3.3 Gyr panels in Fig. 9).\n4.1. Stripping of the subcluster gas\nThe subcluster gas in the simulation shown in Fig. 9 illustrates a classic ram pressure stripping scenario. As the subcluster falls in for the first time, its outer gas is stripped and\nforms a comet-shaped tail (1.34\u20131.5 Gyr gas fraction panels\nin Fig. 9). At t = 1.5 Gyr, the cool dense gas in the main cluster core presents an obstacle to the smooth supersonic flow\nof this stripped gas. This gives rise to a second bow shock\nclearly seen in the 1.5 Gyr panel \"in front of\" the main core,\nmaking the picture symmetric.\nThe front tip of the gas still remaining in the subcluster core\nis a sharp cold front caused by ram pressure stripping early in\nthe merger. At core passage, where the infall velocity and\nthe ambient gas density are at their maximum, ram pressure\non this remaining gas is so high that the gas is pushed back\nfrom the subcluster's DM peak. At t \u2243 1.4 Gyr, our subcluster\nlooks much like the \"bullet\" in 1E 0657\u201356, which exhibits a\nshock front, a cold front, and cool gas lagging the DM peak\n(Markevitch et al. 2002).\nAs the subcluster moves out, the ram pressure rapidly\ndiminishes, and we again see the effect of the rampressure/gravity slingshot, which at t = 1.5 Gyr returns the\n\n\f12\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 10.- Density, temperature and velocity along the white lines in Fig. 9. As in Fig. 5, solid and dashed lines in the top panels represent gas and DM density,\nrespectively; solid and dashed lines in the velocity panels show the components parallel and perpendicular to the y-axis (white lines in Fig. 9), relative to the DM\npeak. Note that the velocity scale is much larger than in Fig. 5.\n\ncool gas to the DM peak and later makes it overtake the DM\npeak, as seen, e.g., in the A168 cluster (Hallman & Markevitch 2004) and in the Mathis et al. (2005) simulations.\nAround t = 3.4 Gyr, the subcluster falls in for the second\ntime. By this time it has lost a large fraction of its DM mass\nand is not able to retain any of its gas after the second core\npassage. In the 3.3 Gyr panel of Fig. 9, we see how the cool\ngas peak is completely detached from the DM peak as soon\nas they enter the dense region of the main cluster. Eventually,\nthis most persistent parcel of cool gas falls to the center of the\nmain cluster, where it starts sloshing in the potential minimum\n(4.8 Gyr panels in Figs. 9 and 10). By that time, the main\ncluster's own cool central gas has escaped from the core. At\nthis stage, the cluster looks relatively relaxed on a large scale\n(\u00a77.1); the most notable feature is this sloshing cool gas in\nthe center which originally belonged to the infalling subcluster. This curious replacement of the gas in the center does not\n\noccur for all combinations of the merger mass ratios and impact parameters. We should also note that artificial viscosity\nand the finite resolution of our simulations inhibit small-scale\nturbulence, which may act to mix the ICM from the two subclusters earlier.\n5. EXPLORING THE PARAMETER SPACE\n\n5.1. Main cluster without cooling flow\nFor a contact discontinuity at constant pressure, a density\nand temperature jump by a factor of two corresponds to an\nentropy ratio of 25/3 \u223c 3. The obvious condition for the formation of a cold front is that gases with such different entropies should exist in the cluster in order for a merger to\nbring them into contact. Clusters with \"cooling flows\" do\nhave steep radial entropy gradients in the centers which, as\nwe saw above, are sufficient to produce cold fronts when disturbed. However, about 1/3 of the nearby clusters do not have\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n13\n\nto the DM peak and there is no sloshing seen in the main\ncluster's core, until the stripped dense, cool central gas from\nthe subcluster falls there several gigayears later. This experiment shows that although the cluster without a steep central\nentropy decline can produce a large, prominent cold front of\nthe \"slingshot\" origin in the course of a merger, \"sloshing\"\ncold fronts do require a cooling-flow type gas profile.\nA cooling flow-like temperature drop is not required, as\nlong as there is an entropy gradient. Ricker & Sarazin (2001)\nsimulated a merger in an isothermal cluster with a cuspy potential, which shows the formation of similar multiple mushroom heads. The specific entropy declines toward the center\nless steeply than in a cooling flow cluster, hence the linear\nscale of the resulting sloshing is bigger (note also that this\nmerger involves a gas-containing subcluster, so the initial disturbance was greater).\n\nF IG . 11.- Ram pressure exerted on the upper-right side of the main cool\ngas core during the subcluster fly-by, for the gas run shown in Fig. 9. The\nquantity shown is the product of the gas density and the square of the radial\ncomponent of the inflow velocity (relative to the DM peak) along the diagonal\nline from the DM peak to the upper-right. Units are arbitrary. The distance\nis from the DM peak, the labels show moments of time. At t = 1.35 Gyr, the\npressure on the core is exerted by the shocked main cluster gas; the second\nbump around r = 100 kpc is the approaching gas stripped from the subcluster\n(at 1.39 Gyr, it moves to r = 50 kpc). After reaching a maximum around\n1.35 Gyr, the ram pressure generally declines rapidly with time, resulting in\na slingshot-like rebound of the main cluster gas.\n\ncooling flows, instead exhibiting roughly isothermal flat gas\ncores. In such clusters, the gas is fairly well fitted by a simple \u03b2-model, \u03c1gas \u221d (1 + r2/rc2 )\u22123\u03b2/2 with rc \u223c 100 kpc. The\ngas entropy is still increasing with radius in the cores of such\nclusters, but much slower than in the cooling flow clusters. It\nis interesting to see if such low entropy contrast is sufficient\nto generate sloshing and cold fronts.\nWe have performed an experiment in which the initial density and temperature profiles for the main object are derived\nusing c = 1 in equation (2), which corresponds to no cool central component. Both DM profiles are kept the same, and the\nsubcluster still possesses a cool core with c = 0.17. All other\nmerger parameters are also the same. For c = 1 and our fiducial DM profile for the main cluster, the gas temperature and\ndensity profiles given by expressions (2) and (3) are similar\nto a \u03b2-model with rc = 115 kpc. For this profile, the entropy\nincrease by a factor of 3 from its central value is reached at\nr = 560 kpc, while between r = 0 and rc , it increases only by\na factor of 1.6. For comparison, for our default cooling flow\nprofile with c = 0.17, the entropy rises by a factor of 3 already\nat r \u223c 70 kpc.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 12. The gas core of the main\ncluster is now easily pushed downward from the DM peak by\nthe ram pressure of the stripped subcluster gas. As this ram\npressure diminishes, we see the development of a \"slingshot\"\ncold front (2.0 Gyr panel in Fig. 12), similar to that in our simulations with a cool gas peak (compare to the 1.9 Gyr panel\nin Fig. 9). As before, this cold front is a contact discontinuity\nbetween the main cluster and the stripped subcluster gases.\nWith time, it travels beyond r = 1 Mpc, maintaining a density\ncontrast around a factor of 2.\nHowever, no RT instabilities form inside the region delineated by this cold front - there is just not enough entropy\ncontrast for them to develop. So no cool gas is flowing back\n\n5.2. Main cluster without DM cusp\nIt is also interesting to see how the shape of the central DM\nprofile affects the generation of cold fronts - in particular, if\nthe DM density cusp, \u03c1dm \u221d r\u22121 , in the center of a Navarro,\nFrenk & White (1995) halo or the Hernquist (1990) profile\nused here, is a necessary condition. For this, we consider a\nlimiting case where the main cluster DM profile is given by\n\u03c1dm (r) =\n\n1\n3M0\n,\n3\n4\u03c0a (1 + r/a)4\n\n(9)\n\nwhich features a constant-density core at r \u226a a.\nThe gas still has a cooling-flow like density peak at the center. While this situation does not seem likely in nature, it is a\nuseful test case. The gas temperature profile is given by equation (2), and the density profile is computed numerically from\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium equation. We have set the free\nparameters of the model to the values M2 = 1.1 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 ,\na = ac = 300 kpc and c = 0.3, so that the initial temperature\nand density profiles of the ICM are as close as possible to\nthose of the previous experiments in \u00a7\u00a7 3-4 (and to those observed in real cooling flow clusters). The subcluster has the\nsame gas and DM profiles as before, and the mass ratio and\nthe impact parameter of the merger are the same as in \u00a7\u00a73-4.\nResults of this simulation are plotted in Fig. 13. All the\nsalient features observed in a cluster with the cuspy DM profile (\u00a74) are present - a \"slingshot\" cold front, a RT tongue\nof low-entropy gas flowing back into the core, and subsequent sloshing of this gas in the core with the creation of\nnon-concentric cold fronts. The notable difference is that the\namplitude of this sloshing is wider and its period longer (and\ntherefore the cold fronts are fewer) than in \u00a74, as expected for\nthe weaker gravitational attraction toward the cluster center.\nThus, sloshing of the cool, dense central gas and the resulting\ncold fronts can develop in a wide range of cluster DM profiles,\nfrom flat to cuspy.\n5.3. Subcluster mass ratio\nIn this and the following section, we investigate which\nmerger mass ratios and impact parameters are more favorable\nto the formation of cold fronts in the cluster centers.\nEncounters with different mass ratios are shown in Fig. 14.\nAll other parameters are set to the same values as in \u00a74, the\nsatellite has its own gas component and the main cluster has\nboth a DM cusp and a cooling flow. Major mergers (R = 2, top\npanel) trigger extremely strong perturbations in the ICM of\nthe main cluster.

The satellite, however, still possesses a cool gas core. A plot under each image shows the fraction of particles belonging to the two subclusters. Even though\nthere is no cool gas in the main cluster, its entropy still declines toward the center, and the low-entropy gas still creates a cold front (middle panel), which quickly\nmoves outwards.\n\nF IG . 13.- Encounter with R = 5, b = 500 kpc (as in Fig. 9), but now the DM density profile of the main cluster has a flat central core instead of a cusp (eq. 9),\nwhile the gas in both subclusters has cool peaks. The behavior is qualitatively similar to the run with a cuspy DM profile, but the amplitude of sloshing is much\nlarger.\n\nform after the first passage of the satellite, but its second passage about 1.5 Gyr later (for our particular merger parameters) destroys them. There are obvious signatures of merging\nduring most of the process, so the cluster would not look \"relaxed\" until long after the merger. When the system finally\nsettles down into equilibrium, sharp discontinuities in the core\nhave been erased by shock heating and vigorous turbulence.\nMore modest mergers with R = 20 \u2212 100 (middle and lower\npanels in Fig. 14) produce longer-lived cold fronts in the main\ncore. Such small subclusters, merging with this particular impact parameter (b = 500 kpc), do not cause a complete detachment of the cool gas peak from the DM peak, contrary to\n\nthe R = 2 case above and our default simulation with R = 5.\nThere is a weak slingshot front, but with little (for R = 20) or\nno (for R = 100) RT-like filament of cool gas flowing from the\nfront inward - the lowest-entropy gas has never left the center. The pressure disturbance is still sufficient to displace the\ncoolest gas and cause its sloshing. Thus, during mergers with\nthe smallest subclusters, the behavior of the gas in the center\nof the main cluster initially looks almost like that in a pureDM subcluster run (\u00a73). A big difference, however, is the cool\ngas from the subcluster that is completely stripped during the\nfirst passage. This gas quickly falls into the center, causing\nturbulence and destroying any coherent structure there. This\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n15\n\nF IG . 14.- Encounters with different mass ratios: R = 2 (top), 20 (middle) and 100 (bottom); b = 500 kpc in all cases.

These simulations have been run at a lower resolution, with 2 \u00d7 106 (gas + DM) particles.\n\noccurs more quickly for less massive subclusters - about\n0.8\u20131 Gyr after the core passage for the R = 20 merger, but\nonly 0.4 Gyr for the R = 100 merger. In a few gigayears, this\ngas will relax into a new cool core, and the remaining pureDM satellite may cause sloshing during subsequent pericenter\npassages, as in \u00a73.\n5.4. Impact parameter of the merger\nThe generation and survival of cold fronts also depends\non the merger impact parameter. In one extreme, a head-on\nmerger with a subcluster containing gas is likely to destroy the\ncentral cool core and generate a chaotic velocity field which\nprecludes the formation of any coherent structures (top panel\nin Fig. 15). The exception is a merger in which the subcluster\nhas such low gas density that it is completely stripped before\nthe DM subcluster passes the main core. This case would\n\nbe similar to a head-on merger with a DM-only subcluster,\nwhich is a simple symmetric limiting case of the encounter\ndiscussed in \u00a73. It generates sloshing and concentric cold\nfronts at smaller and smaller radii in the main core via processes discussed in detail in that section. The significant difference here would be that the stripped subcluster gas eventually falls into the center and disturbs those fronts.\nEncounters with a large impact parameter are more favorable to the formation and survival of the cold fronts in the\ncenter. Lower panel in Fig. 15 shows a simulation for b = 1\nMpc. The overall picture is qualitatively similar to our default b = 500 kpc case (Fig. 9). However, the slingshot cold\nfront forms at a greater radius and is more detached from the\ndensest gas in the core, which is never significantly separated\nfrom the main DM peak. The low-entropy gas (not quite so\n\n\f16\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 15.- Collisions with different initial impact parameters, for R = 5 and DM+gas subcluster run.

The top run has N = 107 gas particles, the bottom run has N = 106 particles.\n\nlow-entropy as near the very center) still forms a flow from\nthe middle of the slingshot front toward the center. The angular momentum of the dense gas behind the slingshot front\nis now higher (because the angular momentum of the merger\nis higher), which makes the gas to flow toward the center in a\nwell-pronounced spiral pattern. Close examination shows that\nthis spiral flow is a limiting, very lopsided case of the staggered mushroom-like structures that we saw in Figs. 7 and 9\n(see \u00a73.3).\nBetween the time when the slingshot cold front moves beyond r = 500 kpc and the return of the subcluster, there is a\n1\u20131.5 Gyr period when the cluster looks relaxed on a 1 Mpc\nscale, except for the central spiral cold front (e.g., the 3.0 Gyr\npanel in Fig. 15). Around t = 4.0 Gyr, the subcluster makes a\nsecond passage with a smaller angular momentum, hits close\nto the center and its gas core disturbs the cold fronts. A few gigayears later, we have a relatively relaxed cluster with a sloshing core similar to the one in our b = 500 kpc run (the 4.8 Gyr\npanel in Fig. 9), except its central gas is now a mixture of\ngases from both subunits.\nTo summarize, minor mergers (R & 5) with relatively large\ninitial impact parameters (b & 500 kpc, corresponding to pericentric distances of a few hundred kpc) can easily cause sloshing of the innermost cool, dense gas of the main cluster around\nthe minimum of the gravitational potential, giving rise to\n\"sloshing\" cold fronts. For mergers with a DM+gas subcluster, there are periods (albeit relatively short) when the system\nappears relaxed on large scales and the most visible features\nare these cold fronts. In general, the bigger the mass ratio and\nthe bigger the impact parameter, the less violent is the largescale disturbance and the more regular the central cold front\n\nstructure (with the caveat that eventual infall of the cool gas\nstripped from the subcluster disturbs it faster if the subcluster is less massive). For DM-only subclusters, a merger with\nany reasonable mass ratio and impact parameter would look\nrelaxed.\n6. NUMERICAL EFFECTS\n\n6.1. Resolution\nBefore proceeding to discussing the above results, we need\nto address several numerical issues. First, we would like to\ncheck whether the sharp edges that we see in the temperature\ndistribution are indeed discontinuities (at least at our resolution) or just steep gradients. This can be done by comparing\nthe width of these features with the code resolution. We selected an interesting moment in our default DM+gas subcluster run (t = 1.7 Gyr, see the 1.67 Gyr panel shown in Fig. 9)\nwith two cold fronts developed in regions of different gas densities, and reran the whole simulation with a lower number of\ngas particles, 106 and 105 (compared to the default 107 ). Initial conditions were identical.\nFigure 16 shows the temperature profile along a line passing approximately perpendicularly through both cold fronts.\nTypically, SPH simulations can resolve structures larger than\ntwice the smoothing scale h, which in our experiments\nroughly corresponds to the distance to the 64-th neighbor. As\ncan be seen in Fig. 16, the width of our temperature gradients\nis indeed close to (or even smaller than) 2h at the locations\nof the cold fronts, shown by the horizontal bars. As the resolution improves, both features become correspondingly narrower. Although this does not guarantee that increasing the\nnumber of particles still further will not eventually resolve\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\nF IG . 16.- Temperature across the cold fronts at t = 1.7 Gyr in the encounter with a DM+gas satellite described in \u00a74. Dotted, dashed and solid\ncorrespond to the same simulation, run with N = 105 , 106 and 107 gas particles. Horizontal lines indicate the resolution of each experiment, computed\nas twice the SPH smoothing length at y = 7 and 100 kpc. The widths of both\nfronts are equal to the resolution in all cases.\n\nthem, it strongly suggests that they are genuine discontinuities and not finite gradients.\nIn any case, it is encouraging that both cold fronts are\npresent in the same places at the same time at all 3 resolutions. Furthermore, the N = 106 profile is very similar to that\nfrom our default N = 107 experiment, except for the gradient widths. This suggests that we have achieved numerical\nconvergence. It is also clear that N = 105 gas particles is not\nenough to model the central cold fronts.\nIt is interesting to compare our linear resolution with the\nelectron mean free path due to Coulomb collisions,\n\u00132 \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\u22121\nne\nT\n,\n(10)\n\u03bbe \u2248 23 kpc\n8\n\u22123\n\u22123\n10 K\n10 cm\nwhere ne is the electron number density (e.g., Sarazin 1988).\nIn the absence of magnetic fields, this is the minimum scale\nat which the hydrodynamic approximation is applicable. In\nreality, the ICM is magnetized and collisionless, so the true\nmean free path is significantly smaller (which was shown\nobservationally for the cold front in A3667, Vikhlinin et al.\n2001). Figure 17 shows \u03bbe from eq. (10) for our fiducial\nmain cluster, along with the numeric resolution for our 107\nparticle runs. Throughout the interesting radial range, our numeric resolution element is bigger, so we do not yet have to\nworry about what happens in the intracluster plasma on a microscopic level. Future increases in numeric resolution (e.g.,\ndotted line in Fig. 17 for 109 particles) might pose such questions.\nOn the other hand, Figure 17 also shows that we may be underestimating the amount of small-scale instabilities and turbulence, because our numeric resolution essentially imposes\nan artificial damping scale for them. This may be important\nfor the survival of cold fronts, because as we saw in \u00a74, they\nare disrupted by turbulence (at least on those scales at which\nturbulence does occur in our simulations). It is instructive to\nevaluate the characteristic Reynolds numbers in our simulations. For an ideal gas, it is Re \u223c Md/l, where M is the Mach\nnumber of the flow, d is the characteristic linear scale and l\n\n17\n\nF IG . 17.- Mean free path of the electrons (solid lines) for our 1.4 \u00d7\n1015 M\u2299 cluster with a Hernquist dark matter halo and a cool core, compared\nto the resolution of our simulations with N = 107 SPH particles (dashed line)\nand a hypothetical experiment with N = 109 (dotted lines).\n\nis the mean free path of the gas particles. Turbulence can develop when Re & 10. At the crudest approximation, we may\nsubstitute our linear resolution (Fig. 17) for l. Then looking\nat the later panels in Fig. 7 (the DM infall case), Reynolds\nnumbers for the flow around the cool edge features are in the\nrange 3\u20136, taking the scale of those features as d. So at our\nresolution, turbulence cannot develop there. In the gas subcluster run, Re \u223c 30 on a 0.5 Mpc scale, and the destructive\neffects of turbulence on the cold fronts can indeed be seen in\nFig. 9.\n6.2. Artificial viscosity\nApart from the resolution, there is a more insidious numerical effect, recently pointed out by Dolag et al. (2005), that\nmight affect our results. The SPH formalism resorts to artificial viscosity in order to properly model shock waves. Artificial viscosity tends to erase structures in the velocity field\nand suppress turbulence. A comparison between the artificial viscosity implemented in G ADGET with the new scheme\nproposed by Dolag et al. (2005, see their Fig. 9) shows that\nturbulence increases in the latter and tends to break up the\nfluid interfaces corresponding to our stripping-induced cold\nfronts. Judging from the apparent magnitude of the effect\nin Dolag et al. (2005), sloshing-induced cold fronts should\nstill form in the cores if one uses the improved scheme, but\ntheir structure may be more irregular and the survival time\nshorter than suggested by our results. On the other hand, our\ncold fronts, both sloshing and subcluster-stripping types, have\nregular shapes very similar to those observed in real clusters\n(\u00a77.1 below), suggesting that physical viscosity in real systems may not be negligible. This merits a detailed investigation in future works (and may even help to measure the viscosity in the ICM).\nThe artificial viscosity also increases the entropy of the gas\nin locations of a steep velocity gradient. To quantify this effect in our simulations, in Fig. 18 we plot the relative entropy\nincrease of SPH particles, S(t)/S(0), for the encounter with\nthe pure DM satellite (\u00a73). In this run, the subcluster wake\nbecomes a weak shock only after pericentric passage, so the\nentropy in the central region should stay constant through-\n\n\f18\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 18.- The ratio of the gas entropy increase relative to the initial entropy (a numeric artifact), for DM-only run, at t = 2.0 and 6.0 Gyr.\n\nout the whole simulation. We can see, however, that artificial\nviscosity injects a small amount of \"numerical entropy\" into\nthe ICM at the locations of the cold fronts, which often exhibit velocity shear. At t = 2 Gyr, this results in a \u223c 20%\nincrease in the entropy of some particles. The effect becomes\nstronger as the large spiral structure develops. By 6 Gyr, for\nsome particles the specific entropy has increased by 50% from\nits original value. At constant pressure (imposed by hydrostatic equilibrium), that translates into temperatures higher,\nand densities lower, by 12% and 28% with respect to their\ntrue values. As we mentioned in \u00a73.3, this may inhibit sinking\nof the dense gas from the cold fronts back toward the center,\nand therefore make the outer parts of the cool spiral structure\nmore prominent. However, compared to the steep overall gas\ndensity gradient in the cluster, this artificial density change is\nsmall and should not affect the picture qualitatively.\nFinally, in the first panel of Fig. 9, one may notice a narrow\nhot strip along the lower boundary of the gas stripped from\nthe subcluster. It is seen more prominently in the corresponding X-ray image (the first panel in Fig. 22, slightly shifted in\ntime) as a narrow low-brightness strip separating the two subclusters. Its width is a couple of resolution elements. This\nstrip contains high-entropy gas from the outskirts of the main\ncluster that the subcluster has dragged inside, due to the fact\nthat the gas cannot flow freely along the interface. This \"viscosity\" appears to be a resolution effect. It may or may not\nreflect what happens in real clusters, but it should not affect\nour present results in any qualitative way.\n7. DISCUSSION\n\n7.1. Comparison with observations\nOur simulations have shown that mergers with a wide range\nof parameters, even with the subcluster lacking any gas at all,\neasily set off sloshing in the cool central gas and generate cold\nfronts with density and temperature jumps of a factor of 2\nand more, the amplitudes observed in real clusters. However,\nobservers deal with projected X-ray brightness and temperatures, so it is interesting to see if our simulated clusters would\nlook similar in projection.\nTo match Chandra images and spectra, we have constructed\n\nX-ray surface brightness and temperature maps according to\nthe spectral weighting scheme described in Vikhlinin (2005).\nThe X-ray emission of each particle is computed as\nLi = mi \u03c1i c(Ti ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere mi , \u03c1i and Ti are the mass, density and temperature of\nthe SPH particle and c(T ) is a function containing the Chandra sensitivity to thermal plasma spectra (Vikhlinin 2005).\nTo obtain the temperature that an observer fitting a spectrum\nfrom a certain cluster region with a single-temperature model\nwould derive, the gas temperatures along the line of sight are\nweighted proportional to\nwi = Li Ti\u22120.875 .\n\n(12)\n\nX-ray luminosities and temperatures have been projected\nalong each of the three main axes of the simulation box and\nthen smoothed with the two-dimensional kernel\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 u\u2212ui 1 u\u2212ui 1 v\u2212vi 1 v\u2212vi\n(13)\n+\n\u2212\n+\nW (u, v) = \u2212\n2 hi\n2 hi\n2 hi\n2 hi\nwhere u and v are projected coordinates and the smoothing\nlength hi is inversely proportional to the cubic root of the density of each particle, computed by the F I E STAS algorithm\n(Ascasibar & Binney 2005).\n7.1.1. Small-scale X-ray and temperature images\nFigure 19 shows X-ray brightness and temperature for three\nprojections of the central 250 kpc region of the cluster from\nour pure-DM subcluster run (\u00a73) at t = 2.1 Gyr, a moment\nwhen the spiral structure is prominent. All three edges seen\nin the corresponding temperature slice (Fig. 7) exhibit density and temperature jumps by a factor of 2. In projection,\na spherical discontinuity becomes a discontinuity in the gradient of the respective quantity. So as expected, the features\nare less prominent in projection, but still clearly seen (with\nthe help of the quadratic dependence of the X-ray brightness\non gas density). The spiral edge pattern projected along the\nx axis looks like several concentric arcs, while the y projection is less favorable and barely reveals only the two central\ndiscontinuities.\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n2.1 Gyr z\n\n2.1 Gyr x\n\n2.1 Gyr y\n\n2.1 Gyr z\n\n2.1 Gyr x\n\n2.1 Gyr y\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n4\n\nkeV\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nkeV\n\n4\n\n19\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nkeV\n\nF IG . 19.- X-ray images (top) and projected temperature maps (bottom) of the central region (0.25 Mpc panel size) for the run shown in Fig. 3 (R = 5, pure\nDM subcluster), as seen from three different directions.

Sufficiently\ndetailed temperature maps for real clusters are much harder to\ncome by, but a 1 Ms Chandra observation of Perseus, the bestexposed cooling flow cluster to date, reveals just such a spiral\ntemperature structure, with several edges at different scales\n(Fig. 20, reproduced from Fabian et al. 2005b; a larger-scale\nmap from XMM can be found in Churazov et al. 2003). The\n\u223c 1\u2032 diameter black ring in the very center is a cool boundary\nof the AGN bubble unrelated to our subject, but the structure\non larger scales bears a remarkable resemblance to that in Fig.\n19.

Large-scale X-ray images\nSince the primary motivation for this study is to explain\ncold fronts in relaxed clusters, now we will check how relaxed our simulated clusters look on larger scales. Figure 21\nshows 1 Mpc X-ray images for several interesting moments of\nour merger with a DM-only subcluster (\u00a73 and Fig. 3). Most\nof the time, the only disturbances seen in the images are the\ncentral cold fronts. For several brief periods, when the DM\nsatellite crosses the cluster, it generates a subtle conical wake\n(first and last panels), but the subcluster spends most of the\ntime in the outskirts.

The panel size is 1 Mpc. Brightness scale is logarithmic\nand the same in all panels. With the possible exception of short moments of the subcluster flyby generating a conical wake (1.5 Gyr and 4.2 Gyr), the cluster\nstays very symmetric on large scales; the only structure is edges in the center.\n\nthe most relaxed cooling-flow clusters in the real world, such\nas A2029 (compare its image in Fig. 1 and the 2.0 Gyr panel\nin Fig. 21) and A1795.\nFigure 22 shows a merger with the DM+gas subcluster (\u00a74,\nFig. 9). At early stages, it generates a wealth of prominent\ncold fronts, including a ram pressure stripping front in the\nsubcluster, a large \"slingshot\" front 0.3\u20130.6 Gyr after the core\npassage, and sloshing fronts in the center around the same\nand later time. However, it also generates a strong general\ndisturbance and asymmetry. At all stages, except long after\nthe merger (the last panel), such disturbance will be obvious\nin any well-exposed X-ray observation. As discussed in \u00a75.4,\nif the satellite is less massive and/or has a greater impact parameter, there may be relatively short periods (of the order\nof 1 Gyr) when disturbances in the r < 500 kpc region (other\nthan the central cold fronts) are weak and the cluster may pass\nas \"relaxed\". However, we conclude that sloshing in the cores\nof the relaxed clusters is most probably caused by near-center\npassages of pure-DM subhalos preserved within the cluster.\n7.2. Other observable effects\n7.2.1. Abundance discontinuities\nThe mergers and processes modeled here to explain the central cold fronts have other observable effects. We expect discontinuities in the metal abundance to accompany the temperature discontinuities, even if the satellite did not contribute\ngas with a different abundance, or any gas at all. They would\nresult from the centrally peaked initial abundance profiles, observed in most, if not all, cooling-flow clusters (e.g., Vikhlinin\net al. 2005). Sloshing brings into contact the gases from dif-\n\nferent initial radii and should create abundance jumps just as it\ncreates the temperature jumps (\u00a77.4 and Fig. 23). Such abundance jumps at the cold fronts are indeed seen in Centaurus\n(Fabian et al. 2005a) and Perseus (Sanders et al. 2004), although Dupke & White (2003) reported no significant abundance discontinuity in A496 from a less statistically accurate\nmeasurement.\n7.2.2. cD oscillations\nThe centers of all cooling flow clusters contain giant cD\ngalaxies, which often exhibit peculiar line-of-sight velocities\nup to a few hundred km s\u22121 relative to the average velocity of\nother cluster galaxies (e.g., Oegerle & Hill 2001). If the cD\ngalaxy sits exactly at the cusp of the DM distribution (as is\nmost likely), we expect it to start oscillating along with the\nDM peak after each subcluster flyby, as shown in Fig. 4. Gas\nsloshing and cD peculiar velocities can thus be caused by the\nsame minor mergers. Indeed, the observed cD peculiar velocities are of the order of what we see in our simulations (e.g.,\nthe velocity of the DM peak during the subcluster flyby in Fig.\n4 is around 200 km s\u22121 ).\nA peculiar velocity of the cD galaxy, and perhaps a disturbed shape of its extended stellar envelope, could be tell-tale\nsigns of a close encounter with a massive subcluster. Such\nsignatures may be expected in cold fronts caused by gasless\nsatellites. At the same time, as we have seen above, cold\nfronts with similar amplitudes may also be caused by hydrodynamical disturbances (i.e. a shock wave) from a gas subcluster orbiting farther away from the center, which may leave\nthe cD galaxy undisturbed. In principle, this difference may\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\n1.4 Gyr\n\n1.7 Gyr\n\n2.0 Gyr\n\n2.7 Gyr\n\n3.3 Gyr\n\n4.8 Gyr\n\n21\n\nF IG . 22.- Projected X-ray brightness for the merger shown in Fig. 9 (R = 5, b = 500 kpc, DM+gas subcluster).

A quantitative analysis is beyond the scope\nof the present paper.\n7.3. Minor mergers or AGN explosions?\nOur simulations have shown that it is very easy to set off\nsloshing of the cool gas in the cluster center. In principle, it\ncould be caused by any disturbance other than a minor merger.\nFor example, an AGN blowing a bubble in the dense gas, such\nas those seen in many cooling flow clusters (e.g., McNamara\net al. 2000) may set off gas sloshing, provided the explosion\nwas offset from the density peak, as seen in simulations by\nQuilis et al. (2001). It would be interesting to model this process in more detail. However, we can put forward two arguments against AGN explosions being a prevalent mechanism\nfor the central cold fronts. First, it is not clear how an AGN\ncould provide angular momentum to the gas, which is necessary to produce the often-observed spiral fronts. Second,\nthe ubiquitous cD peculiar velocities mentioned above indicate that minor mergers such as those simulated here occur\noften, and should generate long-lived sloshing via the mechanism presented here, regardless of whether there are other\nmechanisms at work.\nNote that in some clusters showing X-ray edges near\nthe center, those edges may be an altogether different phenomenon. In the Hydra-A cluster, the edge appears to be a\nweak shock propagating in front of a large AGN-blown bubble (Nulsen et al. 2005). Such edges look somewhat differently from the \"sloshing\" edges considered here, spanning a\nlarger sector (in Hydra-A, it can be traced amost all the way\n\naround the cluster core). In addition, very subtle brightness\nedges or \"ripples\" observed in the core of the Perseus cluster have been attributed to sound waves from the central AGN\nexplosions (Fabian et al. 2005).\n7.4. Physical origin of contact discontinuities\nOur simulations showed that gas sloshing in the cluster center generates sharp contact discontinuities in the gas. We also\nsaw, along with authors of many earlier simulation works,\nthat motion of a gas subcluster creates a discontinuity at its\nfront. Here we would like to address a question which was not\nclearly explained in the literature - how exactly an initially\ncontinuous gas distribution becomes a sharp contact discontinuity. Ram pressure stripping is usually quoted as the agent\n(e.g., Markevitch et al. 2000; Vikhlinin et al. 2001). It was\nshown that inside a cold front in A3667, the azimuthal distribution of the gas pressure closely follows the pressure of\nthe hotter gas flowing around the front, if one models the velocity field around the spherical front and uses the Bernoulli\nequation (Vikhlinin & Markevitch 2002). This indicates that\nthere is pressure equilibrium across the front and therefore\nits shape is stationary or at least evolves slowly (as opposed,\nfor example, to an expanding bubble). It is easy to understand how stripping by such a tangential gas flow around an\ninfalling dense gas subcluster may remove the outer layers of\nthe subcluster's gas until it reaches the radius where the pressure in the cold gas equals the pressure outside. However, at\nthe forward tip of the front (the stagnation point), there is no\ntangential gas flow and no such stripping, yet the fronts are\njust as sharp there.\n\n\f22\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nF IG . 23.- Evolution of initially concentric SPH particles during the encounter with a DM-only satellite as in Fig. 3 (top) and with gaseous satellite as in Fig.\n9 (bottom), showing the emergence of a sharp density discontinuity. The cross shows the DM peak.\n\nWhen the subcluster has a gaseous component, ram pressure is exerted by the shocked ICM gas and then by the gas\nstripped from the subcluster, so one could argue that there are\ndiscontinuities in the ICM to begin with. However, in our\nDM-only subcluster run, there is no shock and no other gas,\nthe gas density and velocity distributions are perfectly continuous until the sloshing starts.\nThe moment when the first contact discontinuities emerge\nin the main cluster core is shown in Fig. 23, where top panels\nshow our simulations with the DM-only subcluster and bottom panels show the one with the gas subcluster. The figures\nshow the positions of individual SPH gas particles extracted\nfrom initially concentric annuli around the main cluster center, in a slice along the merger plane. It is instructive to compare this plot with the figures showing the velocity field, Figs.\n5 and 7 for the DM-only subcluster and Fig. 9 for the gas subcluster. For the DM-only run, 1.55 Gyr is the approximate\nmoment when the main core reverses the direction of motion\nw.r.t. the surrounding gas and starts experiencing ram pressure\nat its downward side. The net force from the ram pressure\nis the same for each cubic centimeter of the gas in the core\n(near the symmetry axis and assuming subsonic motions).\nTherefore, denser gas experiences a smaller resulting acceleration. This quickly produces a velocity gradient inside the\ncore along the direction of the force. The lower-density, outer\nlayer of the core gas (red and green dots) is then squeezed to\nthe sides from the region where the ambient flow eventually\nmeets the dense gas for which the density-proportional gravity or inertial force prevails over the area-proportional ram\npressure force (black dots; 1.80 Gyr panel).\nThe same process occurs in the run shown in lower panels\nof Fig. 23. At 1.4 Gyr, the core starts experiencing ram pressure (much stronger than in the case above), and by the next\nsnapshot the velocity gradient along the ram pressure force\n\nhas brought the dense gas in contact with the outer gas. By\nthe next snapshot, the process is repeated on a smaller scale,\nwhen the densest gas turns around and again starts moving\ntoward the center against an ambient flow.\nOne may note that in both cases, the first discontinuity\narises right after the dense gas overshoots the DM peak. Although this increases the temperature contrast due to adiabatic\nexpansion of the dense gas as it moves to a lower-pressure\nenvironment, it is not a necessary condition and is largely a\ncoincidence. Indeed, sharp contact discontinuities form in the\ninfalling subcluster (e.g., the 1.39 Gyr panel in Fig. 9) and\nin our sloshing core (e.g., the 1.67 Gyr panel) without overshooting the DM core. We conclude that whenever a smooth\ngas density peak encounters a flow of ambient gas (caused\nby subcluster infall, shock passage, sloshing, etc.), a contact\ndiscontinuity quickly forms by \"squeezing out\" the gas layers\nnear the future stagnation point that are not in pressure equilibrium with the flow. Away from the axis of symmetry of the\ncold front, such gas is stripped by the shear flow.\n7.5. Comparison with previous works\nA number of earlier hydrodynamic simulations have been\ndevoted to the origin of cold fronts in clusters since their discovery in real systems. Cold fronts have been seen in several cosmological experiments, always as a consequence of\nmerging activity (e.g. Bialek et al. 2002; Nagai & Kravtsov\n2003; Mathis et al. 2005). The fronts seen in those simulations are analogous to our large-scale discontinuities separating the ICM of the two merging clusters - the ram pressure\nstripping front in the infalling subcluster, and the \"slingshot\"\nfront in the main cluster after the first core passage (Fig. 9).\nThe small-scale sloshing-induced cold fronts described in this\nwork have never been reported in a cosmological setting. This\nis not surprising given that, on one hand, the resolution of\n\n\fCOLD FRONTS IN RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS\nthese works is substantially lower than the experiments presented here. On the other hand, in realistic cosmological simulations, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of concurrent physical processes. For this reason, idealized simulations with controlled initial conditions are very helpful in deriving a physical interpretation of the observed phenomenology.\nSeveral earlier idealized simulations obtained results relevant for the phenomenon considered here. Heinz et al. (2003)\nused 2D simulations to model a passage of a shock wave\nthrough an isothermal \u03b2-model gas core in a stationary gravitational potential. Their core developed a cold front and a\ncirculation pattern where the lower-entropy gas was flowing\nfrom the center toward the front and was then redirected to\nthe sides along the front surface. We do see a similar circulation pattern forming in our simulations whenever the cluster\ncore is subjected to an ambient flow (e.g., Fig. 7). In our case,\nhowever, the initial gas core is not flat but resembles a cooling flow with a steep entropy decline toward the center, and\nthe gas is supported by a cuspy DM profile. This produces additional reverse flows of the lowest-entropy gas from the front\ntoward the center along the filaments forming via RT instability. This was absent in the Heinz et al. (2003) setup.\nChurazov et al. (2003) and Fujita et al. (2004) used 2D simulations to show that a weak shock or acoustic wave propagating toward a cooling flow can displace the cool gas from\nits equilibrium in the gravitational potential well. According\nto Churazov et al., the cool gas then starts oscillating in the\npotential well with different periods for the gas at different\nradii, which produces a series of cold fronts at different radii\nat the opposite sides of the core. The cold fronts are locations\nof the apocenters of oscillations where the gas spends most\nof the time. This is approximately what we see, except that\nthe disturbance in our setup is created by a subcluster flyby.\nWe also find that cold fronts are not the end points of the gas\noscillations (which was also proposed in the original paper\nby Markevitch et al. 2001), but rather structures continuously\nmoving outward through a combination of gas sloshing and\ncirculation inside the front (Figs. 7 and 14 and \u00a73.3).\nFinally, the work that used the setup closest to ours\nis Tittley & Henriksen (2005), who carried out threedimensional numerical simulations of off-center mergers with\nmass ratios 10 and 30. The mergers were selected from a cosmological run. They propose that the central cold fronts arise\nas a result of oscillations of the main cluster's DM peak initiated by the passage of the substructure. In their scenario, the\ncentral gas is dragged along by the DM peak and cold fronts\nform due to compression of the gas on the forward side. They\ndid not actually see the cold fronts because of insufficient resolution (N \u223c 104 \u2212 105 particles, compared to our 107 ). In our\nDM-only subcluster run, the initial decoupling of the cool gas\nfrom the DM peak is indeed caused by a swing of that peak\nduring the subcluster flyby (\u00a73.1). However, the subsequent\ngas sloshing, which generates cold fronts, proceeds with a period much shorter than oscillations of the DM core (\u00a73.2).\nWhen the infalling subcluster has gas, we find that the initial\ngas-DM displacement is also mostly a hydrodynamic effect\n(\u00a74).\n8. SUMMARY\n\nWe used high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of idealized cluster mergers in order to determine if and how they\ncan cause the ubiquitous cold fronts observed by Chandra in\nthe centers of many \"relaxed\" clusters with cooling flows.\n\n23\n\nSeveral numerical experiments have been carried out, varying the mass ratio of the merger, the initial impact parameter,\nand the shape of the central gravitational potential. We also\ntried a merger with a dark matter subcluster devoid of any gas.\nOur initial gas density and temperature profiles match closely\nthose observed in real cooling-flow clusters, such as A2029.\nAs a test, we also tried a cluster with an isothermal gas core.\nOur results show that mergers with small subclusters easily\nset off sloshing of the cool gas in the main cluster central potential minimum, which gives rise to cold fronts very similar\nto those observed in real clusters. The necessary conditions\nfor such sloshing are the presence of an initial steep entropy\ndrop in the center (such as that in cooling flows) and that the\nmerger does not completely destroy the cool core in a head-on\nimpact. The presense of a central DM cusp is not necessary,\nalthough it does make the cold front structure look more realistic.\nIt is difficult to set off central gas sloshing without causing\nan obvious global disturbance in the cluster. When the infalling subcluster has gas, we observe shocks, a cold front in\nthe subcluster, gas stripped from the subcluster, and a largescale \"slingshot\" cold front propagating from the center of the\nmain cluster and separating the ICM of the two halos. If the\nmain cluster had a cooling flow, we additionally see sloshing\nin the center. The cool gas stripped from the subcluster eventually falls into the center of the main cluster and disturbs any\ncoherent motions there. We find that minor mergers with mass\nratios R & 5 and large impact parameters (b = 0.5 \u2212 1 Mpc, corresponding to distance during core passage of 100 \u2212 400kpc)\nmay produce relaxed-looking clusters with the visible disturbance limited to the central sloshing, but only for brief (\u223c 1\nGyr) periods or very late in the merger.\nHowever, if the infalling subcluster did not have any gas\nduring core passage (e.g., it was completely stripped at\nan early stage), the only noticeable disturbance during the\nmerger is the central sloshing. The resulting pattern of cold\nfronts can survive for several gigayears. This type of mergers\nappears to provide the best fit to the most-relaxed observed\nclusters with central cold fronts, such as A2029 and A1795.\nGas sloshing is set off when the gas peak is displaced from\nthe DM peak and starts falling back. In the main core, this occurs as a result of a \"ram pressure slingshot\", when the core\ngas is first compressed and displaced by ram pressure, and\nthen it suddenly diminishes. When the infalling subcluster\nhas gas, ram pressure is caused mainly by the passage of the\nshock. In the DM-only subhalo case, it is caused mostly by\nthe orbital swing of the main DM peak during the subhalo\nflyby. A gravitational wake created by the DM subcluster\nin the gas of the main cluster also plays a role in the latter\ncase. In a process similar to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the\ndensest fraction of the displaced gas quickly turns around and\nstarts falling back toward the potential minimum. It encounters the less-dense gas that is still flowing in the opposite direction, and forms a mushroom-shaped cold front. The mushroom head overshoots the potential minimum, after which the\ndensest gas turns around again and the picture repeats itself\nat progressively smaller linear scales. This creates the oftenobserved pattern of near-concentric density edges at different\nradii on the opposite sides from the center. If the subcluster\nhad a nonzero impact parameter, these edges are not exactly\nconcentric but instead form a spiral pattern, also seen in real\nclusters. This spiral is just a superposition of the independent\nedges and does not represent any coherent spiraling motion,\nat least not initially.\n\n\f24\n\nASCASIBAR AND MARKEVITCH\n\nWe find that although the lowest-entropy gas indeed sloshes\nback and forth in the potential minimum, each cold front,\nonce formed, propagates outward from the center and does\nnot \"turn around\" or \"straighten out\". There appears to be\na circulation pattern in which the lowest-entropy gas initially\nforming this cold front, turns around and sinks back towards\nthe center, while being replaced at the front by higher-entropy\ngas. The caveat here is that details of the long-term evolution\nof the fronts in our simulations may be affected by a numerical artifact, namely, the spurious generation of entropy by the\nartificial viscosity inherent to the SPH scheme.\nOn the other hand, our SPH simulations can trace the origin of gas particles, enabling us to see exactly how the initially continuous gas density and velocity field gives rise to\na contact discontinuity. It arises naturally when the gas density peak starts moving and experiencing ram pressure from\nthe ambient ICM gas, which creates an acceleration gradient along the direction of the flow. The highest-density gas,\nfor which the density-proportional gravity or inertial force\nprevails over the area-proportional ram pressure force, then\nsqueezes the lower-density gas, more easily affected by ram\npressure, to the sides and eventually comes into contact with\nthe ambient medium.\n\nWe have shown that minor mergers easily create sloshing\nand cold fronts in the cooling flow clusters. In principle, any\ngas disturbance may set off sloshing, e.g., AGN explosions,\nand it would be interesting to model such a process in detail.\nHowever, there are arguments against AGN outbursts being\na prevalent mechanism. Most notably, the ubiquitous cD peculiar velocities indicate that minor mergers, such as those\nsimulated here, do occur and should generate sloshing via the\nmechanism presented here.\nIn a forthcoming paper, we will use these simulations to\naddress the effects of the central gas sloshing on cooling flows\nand on the total mass estimates derived under the assumption\nof hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nWe are grateful to L.
