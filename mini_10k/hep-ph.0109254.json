BUSSEY\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow,\nGlasgow G12 8QQ, UK\n\nAbstract\nAt the HERA collider at DESY, high energy electron and positron beams interact with\nproton beams. A review is presented of the variety of ways in which these collisions\nproduce final states containing charm and beauty quarks.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. The HERA collider\nThe HERA collider is the only experimental facility in the world where high-energy\nelectron-proton and positron-proton interactions can be studied. Electrons (or\npositrons) and protons are accelerated in the DESY ring complex to energies of 27.5\nGeV and 920 GeV respectively (fig. 1a). The circulating beams are then brought to\na focus at the two collision points where the H1 and ZEUS experiments are located.\nIn most of the e\u00b1 p interactions, the incoming e\u00b1 interacts with the proton by first\nradiating a virtual photon (fig. 1b). The virtuality Q2 of this exchanged photon\n(for definition see section 1.5) lies within a wide range; its minimum value is limited\nby the kinematics of the radiation process to be of the order of the electron mass\nsquared, while its maximum value is limited to 105 GeV2 by the energies of the\nincoming beams.\nDuring the period 1992-2000, the H1 and ZEUS experiments each accumulated\napproximately 135 pb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, which has enabled a broad range\nof physics to be investigated. At low Q2 , the exchanged photon resembles a real\nphoton, and we shall usually refer to such collisions simply as \u03b3p or \"photoproduction\". Real photons, as will be discussed below, can display hadronic as well\nas electromagnetic properties. The hadronic behaviour falls away over a transition\nregion where Q2 is of the order of 1 GeV2 , above which we are in the regime of deep\ninelastic scattering (DIS). Here the photon is primarily an electromagnetic object\nwhich couples to quark-antiquark (q q\u0304) pairs. At very high Q2 the exchange of Z and\nW bosons also becomes important. The \u03b3 \u2217 p luminosity is approximately uniform\nin log Q2 , giving a prolific production of low-Q2 photons.\nDifferences between e+ p and e\u2212 p collisions are of significance in some new particle searches and at the very high Q2 values where electroweak effects occur. In\nthe physics reviewed here, however, the sign of the incoming e beam is nearly al1\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n(b)\ne\n\n\u03b3*\np\n\nFig. 1.

For convenience, we shall normally refer to the incoming e\u00b1 as a\npositron, including electrons by implication, since most of the integrated luminosity\nwas taken with positrons. The symbol \u03b3 \u2217 will denote any virtual photon, while \u03b3\nwill refer, where appropriate, to the particular case of low-Q2 , quasi-real photons.\n1.2. QCD physics with heavy quarks at HERA\nIn the present survey, we consider those processes at HERA in which heavy flavours\nare produced, namely the production of particles containing charm (c) and beauty\n(b) quarks. HERA is par excellence a laboratory for the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), our present theory of the strong interaction. While e+ e\u2212 colliders\nsuch as LEP have enabled the production of q q\u0304 pairs to be studied in depth, along\nwith the associated radiation of gluons, the presence of the proton in the initial state\nat HERA allows a wide variety of further QCD processes to be investigated. The\nincoming \u03b3 \u2217 , with its range of virtualities, probes powerfully the partonic properties\nof the proton and the reactions initiated through the quarks and gluons of which\nthe proton is a source.\nHeavy quark production can also, of course, be studed in hadron-hadron colliders\nsuch as the Tevatron. However a virtual photon is a cleaner probe than a second\nhigh-energy hadron, and it is experimentally possible to trigger on photon-induced\nprocesses that occur down to lower transverse momenta, down to a few GeV.\nThe behaviour of QCD processes is governed by the running coupling constant\n\u03b1s , whose value is \u22480.12 at momentum transfers corresponding to the Z mass,\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n3\n\nthough significantly higher at a few GeV. Consequently, the lowest-order (LO) perturbative calculations, which suffice to a first approximation, require frequently to\nbe replaced by next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations or higher. This can present\nformidable technical difficulties, which can limit our experimental understanding of\nQCD. With light quark systems, a certain impasse may by now have been reached,\nbut the consideration of b or c quarks presents a number of new factors. These arise\nbecause the production of a heavy object requires a corresponding momentum transfer which may be significantly higher than the QCD scale parameter \u039bQCD \u2248 300\nMeV. Such processes offer a different perspective on the operation of QCD. The\nmeasured final-state hadron containing a heavy quark relates directly to the properties of the QCD-governed hard scatter, and although the presence of a second\nmomentum scale can complicate the theory, it provides a means of calculating cross\nsections using perturbative approaches that are unavailable, or less reliable, when\ndealing with exclusively light quark systems.\nThere remain a number of difficulties, however. The effective mass of the c\nquark is uncertain within the range 1.3 to 1.5 GeV, a value which is itself not overwhelmingly higher than \u039bQCD . These facts translate into significant uncertainties\nin the perturbative calculations, comparable to the effects of higher-order QCD diagrams. As will be seen, this makes the interpretation of many experiments less\nthan straightforward. The higher mass (\u2248 4.75 GeV) of the b quark should reduce\nthese problems; nevertheless it will be seen that even the production of b hadrons\ncurrently presents challenges to theory.\nA major aspect of heavy quark physics concerns the weak decays of the hadrons\nthat contain these quarks. Such decays may be studied at any collider that is able\nto produce the relevant hadrons in sufficiently large numbers. Many of the most\ninteresting decay channels have low branching ratios, however, and HERA has not\nyet produced data in enough quantity to be competitive here; CP violating effects,\nespecially, lie in the domain of the B factories and the Tevatron. The present survey\ntherefore concentrates on the production mechanisms of heavy flavour systems, an\narea where HERA is able to play a prominent role. The author's aim is to provide an\naccount which is accessible to non-specialist readers and gives an up-to-date picture\nof the state of this area of HERA physics. Experimental results are preliminary\nwhere indicated.\n1.3. The H1 and ZEUS detectors\nThe H1 and ZEUS detectors1,2 are situated respectively at the north and south\ncollision regions of HERA. Each detector comprises of a cylindrical central tracking\nchamber, surrounded by calorimeters. Both central tracking chambers are of drift\nchamber design. In the case of H1, the calorimeters consist of lead and steel converters in liquid argon, and are mainly located inside the solenoidal magnet which\nprovides a magnetic field of 1.15 Tesla. In ZEUS, the calorimeter is a uraniumscintillator sandwich. It lies outside the solenoid, within which there is a field of 1.4\nTesla. The return yokes are part of the muon detection system, with muon detec-\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n4\n\njet\n\njet\njet\nno\nremnant\n\np\n\nremnant\n\nremnant\nremnant\np\n\nremnant\n\njet\n\np\n\nremnant\njet\n\njet\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nVector meson\nP\nI\np\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 2.

H1 has a silicon vertex detector array; ZEUS is currently\ncommissioning its own silicon system.\nBoth detectors have a design which is approximately cylindrically symmetric\naround the beam line, but with a forward-backward asymmetry. In the forward\n(proton beam) direction there is a need for good hadron calorimetry in order to\ndetect energetic particles associated with the proton, its remnants, and particles\nthat are in general boosted in this direction. In the rear direction, the best possible\nelectromagnetic calorimetry is required to measure accurately the deep inelastic\nscattered positrons.\nIn both experiments the calorimetry is designed to be as hermetic as possible,\nwith holes of a minimum size for the beam pipes.\n1.4. Types of photon-hadron interaction\nSince the ep processes of concern here are mediated almost entirely by photons,\nsome basic classes of photon-proton interactions must be considered. The most\nimportant of these are illustrated in fig. 2, where the first three diagrams depict\ndifferent hard QCD scattering processes. Direct processes (a) are those in which\nthe entire photon couples to a quark-antiquark line at high transverse momentum\npT . Alternatively (b), the proton may interact through an intermediate hadronic\nstate which is a source of partons that can scatter off those in the proton. These\nare known as resolved photon processes, and here the photon possesses a parton\nstructure like any other hadron. The concept of a resolved photon can be extended\nto situations where the photon couples to a relatively low-pT quark pair (c). These\nperturbatively calculable processes are sometimes referred to as anomalous photon\nprocesses.3\nUltimately, the outgoing partons hadronise as jets or beam remnants. The signature for a resolved or direct photon process at LO is the presence or absence,\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n5\n\nrespectively, of a photon remnant in the event. The direct and resolved classes of\nphoton interaction are fully distinct only in LO processes such as those illustrated.\nAt NLO the two classes can still be defined for calculational purposes, but a continuum of diagrams exists connecting them. In photoproduction, the resolved processes\noccur at higher rates than the direct process, but as the Q2 of the photon increases,\nthe resolved cross sections decrease and the reactions become predominantly direct\nin nature.\nThe fraction x\u03b3 of the incoming photon energy that enters a given QCD subprocess is an important parton-level quantity. In direct processes it is by definition\nunity, while in resolved processes it can take any value in the range (0,1). The\nparameter x\u03b3 is clearly defined in LO diagrams but at higher order there can be\nambiguities. Experimentally the hadronic final state is measured, and a suitable\nfinal-state quantity is required which correlates with x\u03b3 in a chosen theoretical description of the process. For dijet final states, two such experimental estimators4,5\nare\njet\n\u03a3jets (E \u2212 pz )\n\u03a3jets ETjet e\u2212\u03b7\nand\nx\u03b3meas =\n.\n=\nxOBS\n\u03b3\n2E\u03b3\n\u03a3event (E \u2212 pz )\nHere as elsewhere ET denotes transverse energy, namely E sin \u03b8 for a single particle,\nsummed over the particles in a jet. The laboratory pseudorapidity \u03b7 is given by\n\u03b8\n\u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan ,\n2\nwhere \u03b8 is the polar angle and the proton beam defines the forward (+z) direction.\nThe proton has E \u2212pz = 0 to an excellent approximation, and a quasi-real incoming\nphoton has E \u2212 pz = 2E\u03b3 = \u03a3event (E \u2212 pz ). Snowmass - i.e. ET -averaged -\nmeas\nquantities6 are used in xOBS\nthe sums are over all particles in the jets\n\u03b3 , while in x\u03b3\nand in the event as a whole. One notes that for a massless object, ET e\u2212\u03b7 \u2261 (E \u2212pz );\nthe two estimators differ in that xOBS\nneglects jet-mass effects. The estimator xOBS\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nhas been mostly used in HERA analyses.\nA further class of processes in which bb\u0304 and cc\u0304 systems are produced comprises\ndiffractive processes. An example is illustrated in fig. 2d, where the photon forms an\nintermediate vector meson state V which scatters off the proton by the exchange of\na pomeron. Both quasi-real and highly virtual photons may take part in diffractive\nprocesses at HERA; these will be the subject of Section 6 of this paper.\n1.5. DIS kinematics\nLet the incoming and the scattered positron have four-momenta k and k \u2032 respectively. Then the exchanged photon virtuality is\nQ2 = \u2212q 2 = \u2212(k \u2212 k \u2032 )2 = 4EE \u2032 cos2 (\u03b8e /2),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8e is the polar angle of the scattered positron relative to the proton beam\ndirection. If the overall ep centre-of-mass energy is s = (k + P )2 , where P is the\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n6\n\nproton four-momentum, then Bjorken x is defined as Q2 /(2P * q). The quantity\ny=\n\nE \u2032 1 \u2212 cos \u03b8e\nQ2\n=1\u2212\n,\nsx\nE\n2\n\n(2)\n\nrepresents the virtual photon energy, as a fraction of the positron energy, in the\nproton rest frame.\nThe cross sections for unpolarised DIS can be expressed in terms of structure\nfunctions F2 and F1 . It is usually valid to neglect the contribution from F1 ; one\nthen obtains:\n\u0001\nd2 \u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03b12\n1 + (1 \u2212 y)2 F2 (x, Q2 )\n(3)\n=\n2\n4\ndx dQ\nQ x\n\nin terms of the electromagnetic coupling constant \u03b1. The overall structure function\nwill be denoted by F2 and the structure function for charm-containing events by F2c\nThe \u03b3 \u2217 p centre-of-mass energy or, equivalently, that of the final-state hadronic\nsystem, is termed W .\n\n2. QCD Aspects of Heavy Flavour Production\nPerturbative methods in QCD calculations require the occurrence of a momentum\ntransfer that is much greater than the QCD scale parameter \u039bQCD . We shall first\noutline an approach that is widely used in calculating heavy quark cross sections for\nprocesses involving a high-pT scatter. Let a hadron H, containing a heavy quark of\nflavour h, be produced from two initial-state partons i, j. The cross section is then\nexpressed as the product of two basic terms:\n\u03c3QCD (ij \u2192 hx) f (h \u2192 H).\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3QCD is the perturbatively calculated QCD cross section, i.e. at the parton\nlevel. Here the symbol x denotes further parton-level products, and the fragmentation factor f (h \u2192 H) is the probability for h to fragment into H in an outgoing jet.\nThe inclusive fragmentation probability for x is taken as unity; if we are interested\nin a particular final-state product X then a further factor f (x \u2192 X) is needed. All\nthese quantities are kinematics-dependent.\nIn HERA physics, the initial-state partons i, j can be taken as quarks, gluons or\nthe incoming photon itself. A parton distribution function (pdf), namely f (p \u2192 j),\nis required for the proton. In resolved photon processes, a pdf f (\u03b3 \u2192 i) must be\nsupplied similarly to denote the probability that the photon gives rise to the quark\nor gluon i that interacts.\nFinally, expressions of type (4) are summed over all the relevant parton states.\nThus for direct inclusive photoproduction of a given D meson one can write\nX\nf (p \u2192 j) \u03c3QCD (\u03b3j \u2192 cx) f (c \u2192 D).\n(5)\n\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 Dx) =\nj,x\n\nThe following points need to be noted:\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n7\n\n(i) The QCD term \u03c3QCD may be calculated at LO or to higher orders;\n(ii) The assumption that a process may be split into separate terms in this way\nis known as factorisation. A given fragmentation factor or pdf is normally\nassumed to be independent of the perturbative QCD process ij \u2192 hx, i.e. it\nis universal. A mention of factorisation usually implies universality.\n(iii) The pdf's and fragmentation factors incorporate a variety of initial-state and\nfinal-state processes. For example gluon radiation may occur and, if sufficiently hard, might legitimately be regarded as constituting a higher-order\nQCD process. By imposing a factorisation scale, one defines up to what momentum transfers such a gluon or its products will still be called part of the\nproton structure or part of the jet.\n(iv) In general, these are non-perturbative quantities and must be obtained either\nfrom models or from experimental measurement. The assumption of universality implies that a fragmentation factor measured in one experiment can be\nused correspondingly in another experimental context. The pdf's are usually\nobtained from fits to large collections of experimental data.\n(v) As the order of the QCD calculation rises, the validity of the above assumptions becomes more questionable.\nBehind the kind of scheme outlined above there lies the physical insight that\nhard processes take place over a shorter time-scale than soft processes. Thus the\nproduction of the heavy quark may be regarded as prior to, and physically distinguishable from, the subsequent slower hadronisation phase.\n2.1. Methods and models\nAt this point we present some theoretical models and procedures which are in common use in the analysis of heavy quark production. Some further topics will be\ndiscussed later in connection with the specific areas where they are met.\n\u2022 PYTHIA, HERWIG. These well-known Monte Carlo models can calculate a\nlarge variety of QCD processes at LO. Initial and final state leading-logarithm\nparton showers are incorporated to simulate certain kinds of higher order effect. Hadronisation is performed in two different ways. In PYTHIA,7 colour\nstrings are constructed between the final-state partons, and then hadronised\naccording to a set of phenomenological prescriptions. In HERWIG,8 a series\nof parton clusters are produced and allowed to decay. Both these models are\nextensively used, and form the basis of further models. The PYTHIA colourstring fragmentation is also known by the name of JETSET.\n\u2022 Peterson fragmentation model. A standard representation of the fragmentation factor f (h \u2192 H), based on phenomenological considerations, is the\nPeterson formula:9\nf (h \u2192 H) = P D(z) = P\n\nA\nz [1 \u2212 1/z \u2212 \u01eb/(1 \u2212 z)]2\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n8\n\nin which the hadron of interest, H, is produced at a given Feynman z relative to the momentum of the heavy quark h, with z = (E + p|| )H /(E + p|| )h\nwhere p|| denotes the momentum component along the h direction. A is a\nnormalisation constant, and P is the total probability for h to fragment to H.\nThe so-called Peterson parameter \u01eb is determined from experiment:10 a small\nvalue means that the fragmentation is peaked near z = 1. For c and b quarks,\nrespectively, typical values of \u01eb are 0.035 and 0.006. There is a question of\nwhether the hadron is produced, on average, along the same direction as the\nquark, as taken in Peterson fragmentation, or whether the colour string from\nthe proton remnant might pull the hadron to a higher rapidity (the \"beamdrag effect\"11 ). H1 have concluded that the effect is unimportant in DIS charm\nproduction.12 On the other hand ZEUS13 have obtained an improved description of charm rapidity distributions when the hadronisation procedure from\nJETSET or HERWIG is used in place of the Peterson method. These issues\nhave been discussed further by Bodwin and Harris.14 An analytic fragmentation function with possibly better relativistic properties is that of Bowler.15\nOthers have been given by Kartvelishvili et al.16 and Collins et al.;17 see also\nthe review by Frixione et al.18\n\u2022 Fixed flavour-number schemes. In heavy quark production up to NLO, two\nmain schemes have been proposed. In the fixed flavour-number scheme, often\nreferred to in the charm case as the massive charm scheme, the incoming\nphoton and proton are given hadronic structures which contain only three\nquark flavours (u, d, s). QCD interactions are then generated which produce\nheavy quark pairs (qh q\u0304h ), whose dynamics is calculated using a realistic quark\nmass assignment (e.g. mc = 1.5 GeV). The heavy quark then fragments -\ne.g. using the Peterson formula - into an observable hadron. Since heavy\nquark excitation processes (see Section 3) are not treated, and may be important at high energies, these schemes are expected to work best at pT = O(mh ).\n\u2022 Variable flavour-number schemes. To enable quark excitation to take place,\ncharm and beauty are treated as active flavours in the proton or photon. In\nthe more common massless (\"zero-mass\") versions, the mass mh is treated as\nzero up to the final hadronisation which produces a massive H hadron. QCD\nprocesses taking place at pT \u2248 mh may therefore not be accurately described,\nbut this approach should work well at high pT .\n\u2022 DGLAP evolution. Given a set of pdf's or a structure function which apply\nat low Q2 , one may wish to know the corresponding quantities at higher Q2\nfor a given Bjorken x value. The DGLAP equations19 evaluate the necessary\ngluon radiations and splittings that occur in this transition, using perturbative QCD to a given order.\n\u2022 CCFM evolution. As an alternative to DGLAP evolution, the CCFM scheme20\nuses a different form of factorisation in which parton densities are explicitly\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n9\n\ntreated as a function of transverse momentum (which is integrated over in the\nDGLAP treatment) and an angular ordering parameter is introduced. This\nis a development of the earlier BFKL evolution scheme,21 which evolves amplitudes over x instead of Q2 and claims advantages at small x. With CCFM\nthere is a matched transition to the DGLAP regime; it is implemented in the\nCASCADE Monte Carlo among others.22,23\n\u2022 Parton distribution functions. A variety of pdf's are on the market to describe\nthe quark and gluon densities in the proton and the photon. They must be\nprovided in versions suited to the order of the QCD calculation to which they\nare to be applied. In the case of the proton, the pdf's are usually obtained\nfrom fits to large collections of experimental data, and are updated when new\nexperimental results are announced. The constraints of DGLAP evolution\nare normally applied. Two groups active in this area are CTEQ and MRST,\nwhose publications may be consulted for further details.24,25 In addition the\nH1 and ZEUS collaborations have calculated their own proton pdf fits on the\nbasis of the DGLAP equations.26,27\nPhoton pdf's are normally obtained based on the Vector Meson Dominance\nmodel (see Section 6), so that the partonic structure of the photon at low\nvirtualities uses that taken for virtual mesons. An additional direct coupling of\nthe photon to quark pairs (\"box diagram\") is included, and allowance is made\nfor free parameters, such as the gluon density in the photon at low virtuality.\nEvolution in Q2 from a base value Q20 is performed. The models cited in\nthe analyses quoted here, namely GRV,28 GS,29 AFG,30 and SaS,31 differ in a\nnumber of technical aspects, such as the value of Q0 , the factorisation scheme,\ntreatment of heavy quark thresholds, and the number of free parameters that\nhave been fitted to published data. The SaS model extends the pdf's to virtual\nphotons. A review of some of the issues has been given by Vogt.32\n\n3. Open Charm Production at HERA\nThe production of heavy quarks (qh ) in ep collisions takes place through three main\nmechanisms, which are here briefly outlined in turn:\nIn photon-gluon fusion (fig. 2a), the incoming virtual photon interacts with a\ngluon from the proton, so as to form an outgoing q\u0304h qh pair through the reaction\n\u03b3 \u2217 g \u2192 qh q\u0304h . The LO diagram often offers a good description when the quark pair\nemerges at high pT . The fusion process can give a direct measurement of the gluon\ncontent of the proton; this complements the determinations through QCD fits to the\nproton structure function F2 as a function of Q2 . We shall refer to \"photon-gluon\nfusion\" in the context of photoproduction, and \"boson-gluon fusion\" in DIS, where\n\u03b3 \u2217 and W/Z exchanges may both be present.\nIn excitation processes, the incoming \u03b3 \u2217 interacts with a heavy quark that is an\neffective part of the proton structure and scatters it out of the proton. This may\noccur through resolved photon processes and through the direct \"QCD Compton\"\n\n\fCombinations / 0.2 MeV\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n10\n\n6000\n-1\n\nZEUS (prel.) 1995-2000 (127 pb )\nBackgr. wrong charge\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n0.14\n\n0.15\n\n0.16\n\n0.17\n\nM(K\u03c0\u03c0s) - M(K\u03c0) (GeV)\n\nFig. 3.

The proton has only light valence quarks, and so any c or b content in its\npdf is generated by DGLAP evolution - specifically, through a gluon fluctuating\ninto a qh q\u0304h pair. Similar considerations apply to the photon.\nIn production by fragmentation, the heavy quark is found in a jet that originated\nfrom a light parton: specifically, an outgoing gluon splits into a cc\u0304 or bb\u0304 pair. Fragmentation may be treated entirely phenomenologically, obtaining the distributions\nfrom fits to data, or it may be calculated in perturbative QCD, e.g. in the process\n\u03b3q \u2192 gq with g \u2192 qh q\u0304h , namely \"gluon splitting\". This is a higher order QCD\nprocess than the LO fusion term \u03b3g \u2192 qh q\u0304h ,.\nThe distribution of an observed hadron H in a jet requires in any case a phenomenological treatment of the hadronisation process.\n3.1. Charm meson states\nThe lowest charm states are the cd and cu D0 and D\u00b1 mesons, which are produced\nalong with excited states such as the D\u2217 . The D\u2217 mesons are easier to identify\nbecause of their decays to the D states through emission of a pion that is almost\nat rest relative to the D\u2217 . The decay chains D\u2217\u00b1 (2010) \u2192 D0 (1864) + \u03c0 \u00b1 , with\nD0 \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 or D0 \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (+ c.c.) are commonly selected since all the\nfinal state particles are charged, and hence accurately measurable. A typical massdifference plot is shown in fig. 3. No peak is seen in the distribution that uses the\nwrong-sign combinations: this quantifies the background to the signal.\nIn recent ZEUS photoproduction data, the D0 has been measured both as the\n\n\f350\n(a)\n\nZEUS (prel.) 98-00\nCandidates With \u2206M Tag\nGaussian + Backgr.\n\n300\n250\n200\n\nCombinations/0.01 GeV\n\nCombinations/0.01 GeV\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n4000\n\n(b)\n\n11\n\nZEUS (prel.) 98-00\nCandidates Without \u2206M Tag\n\n3500\n\n2 Gaussians + Backgr.\n\n3000\n2500\n2000\n\n150\n1500\n100\n\n1000\n\n50\n0\n\n500\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2\n2.1\nM(K\u03c0) (GeV)\n\n0\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2\n2.1\nM(K\u03c0) (GeV)\n\nFig. 4.

After selection on the \u2206M peak, a dramatic D0 signal\nis seen, while the directly-produced D0 signal lies on a much higher background,\nalthough the number of events in the peak is much larger. In the latter case the\nwrongly-assigned K\u03c0 combinations remain in the plotted background. From these\nplots, ZEUS have evaluated the ratio Pv = V /(V + P S) representing the production\nof the vector D\u2217 (spin-1) relative to the pseudoscalar D. This is predicted to be\n0.75 from simple spin statistics, but the inclusion of decays from heavier charm\nstates and the effects of hadronisation can reduce this value. ZEUS obtains the\nvalue Pv = 0.546 \u00b1 0.045 \u00b1 0.028 (preliminary),35 in agreement with measurements\nat LEP.\u2217\nOther mesons with a single c quark are also observed at HERA. The cs system\nhas as its lowest state the Ds\u00b1 (1969) which has been detected by ZEUS in its \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1\ndecay mode (fig. 5a).36 Details of the production characteristics will be discussed\nbelow. The ratio of the cross sections for Ds\u00b1 and D\u00b1\u2217 production can give a\nmeasure of the strangeness-suppression ratio, a phenomenological parameter of the\nLund string fragmentation scheme. The cross section ratio is found by ZEUS to be\n0.41 \u00b1 0.07+0.03\n\u22120.05 \u00b1 0.10(b.r.), where the last error is the uncertainty on the Ds \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0\nbranching ratio. This value is in close agreement with the corresponding result from\ne+ e\u2212 data. It corresponds to a strangeness-suppression ratio of 0.27 \u00b1 0.04+0.02\n\u22120.03 \u00b1\n0.07(b.r.), in agreement with most other experiments and with the standard default\nvalue of 0.3 in JETSET. Both these and the above results support the concepts of\nfactorisation and universality in charm fragmentation.\n\u00b1\nA further charm state recently reported by ZEUS is the Ds1\n(2536), which decays\n\u2217Here\n\nand elsewhere, unless otherwise stated, the first of two quoted uncertainties is statistical\nand the second is systematic.\n\n\fD\u00b1s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0\u00b1 \u2192 (K+K\u2212)\u03c0\u00b1\n\n300\n\nFit: Gaussian + Exponential\n\nCombinations / 3.5 MeV\n\nCombinations / 10 MeV\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n12\n\n-1\n\nZEUS (prel.) 1995-2000 (127 pb )\next B\n\nFit : Gauss + A (\u2206M )\n\n30\n\n\u2217\u00b1\nN(Ds1\n\u2192 D\u2217\u00b1K0s ) = 62 \u00b1 9\n\n20\n\n200\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0\n\n1.85\n\n1.9\n\n1.95\n\n2\n2.05\n+ \u2212 \u00b1\nM(K K \u03c0 ) (GeV)\n\n0\n2.5\n\n2.55\n\n2.6\n\n2.65\n\nM(D\u2217\u00b1K0s) = \u2206Mext + M(D\u2217+)PDG + M(K0)PDG (GeV)\n\nFig. 5.

A clear signal is seen in photoproduction, (fig. 5b). The production\nrate and helicity characteristics are consistent with other measurements.37 Evidence\nfor the detection of other P -wave charm meson states has also been presented by\nZEUS.38 These are neutral states in the mass range 2.4 to 2.5 GeV. Further statistics\nare required to clarify the observations.\n3.2. Inclusive photoproduction of open charm\nZEUS have published a study in which inclusive differential cross sections for D\u2217\u00b1\nare compared with several \"massive\" and \"massless\" charm schemes in NLO QCD.39\nThe K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 decay channel of the D provides a check on the higher-quality measurements using K\u03c0. The massive charm, fixed flavour-number scheme of Frixione et\nal. (FMNR)40 is taken with several values of the Peterson fragmentation parameter\n\u01eb, along with the massless, variable flavour-number calculations of Kniehl et al.41,42\nand of Cacciari et al.43,44 The two massless calculations differ in the factorisation\nschemes applied to the fragmentation.\nThe shape, although not the normalisation, of the pT distribution of the D\u2217\u00b1 is\nfairly well described by all the models, although the description cannot be said to be\nperfect (fig. 6). The issues have been recently discussed by some of the theoretical\nauthors.45 Pronounced differences, however, appear in the \u03b7 distributions; these are\nshown in fig. 7a 7d integrated over pT from different thresholds. In the highest pT\nrange (d), the scheme of Kniehl et al.42 is more successful than that of Cacciari\net al.,44 whose predictions are too low.

Outer\nerror bars are statistical + systematic combined in quadrature; an overall normalisation uncertainty\nof \u00b14% is not shown. Note that the data here and in the next figure are quoted as ep cross sections.\n\nwork in the lowest pT range measured (a), this is probably of little significance since\nneither massless calculation is appropriate for pT \u2248 mc . In fact even the massive\nscheme can be brought to reasonable agreement only by the artificial recourse of\nsetting mc as low as 1.2 GeV, while the massless schemes are unconvincing for\npT < 6 GeV.\nDifferences at the 20-25% level can be made by varying the photon pdf, as\nillustrated in fig. 7e - 7h, where (e), (g) use the calculation of Kniehl et al. and (f),\n(h) use that of Cacciari et al. For pT < 6 GeV, the GS-G photon structure gives\nbetter results for the Kniehl et al. calculation due to its high c quark density, similar\nto that of the u quark. Since the quasi-real photon is believed to couple mainly\nto light-quark hadronic states, this structure may lack plausibility. It cannot, of\ncourse, be used in the massive-charm, fixed three-flavour-number scheme.\nOverall, the message from these results is that the massive scheme has trouble\nbetween 3 and 6 GeV, where its chances of working are best, while the massless\nscheme of Kniehl et al. does seem to become more successful as pT increases: higher\npT measurements are required to confirm this trend. Results from H146 have also\nbeen compared with the massive and massless charm calculations of FMNR40 and\nKniehl et al.42 Cross sections as a function of laboratory rapidity are shown in\nfig. 8. At low pT the results are qualitative similar to those of ZEUS, but at high\npT the data lie significantly above the calculations, in strong contrast to those of\nZEUS. There are apparent differences between the two experiments here which need\nexplanation.\nMeasurements of Ds production give further comparisons with theory.

Differential cross sections for inclusive Ds production (ZEUS) In the left-hand plot, the\nupper (thinner) curves of each type have mc = 1.2 GeV and the lower (thicker) have mc = 1.5\nGeV. The BKL calculation (right) uses mc = 1.5 GeV.\n\nthe FMNR model at NLO. The fragmentation to the D states was performed with\na Peterson formula: the f (c \u2192 D\u2217\u00b1 ) and f (c \u2192 Ds ) distributions then differ by\na simple scale factor. As discussed above, a standard calculation (heavy curves)\nfails to fit the D\u2217 data although a low mc value will almost suffice. The Ds data\nare consistent with this, but the statistics are at present poor. Another type of\ntheoretical model has been given by Berezhnoy et al. (BKL),47 who relate the experimental value of f (c \u2192 D\u2217\u00b1 ) to f (c \u2192 Ds ) by tuning the colour-singlet and\ncolour-octet contributions to a description of the hadronisation. The D\u2217\u00b1 data are\nused to obtain the relevant singlet/octet ratio, yielding a prediction for the Ds cross\nsections. If both components are used, there is a fair description of the ZEUS data.\n3.3.

The two highest-ET jets found in an event are\nused. In fig. 10a, the distribution in xOBS\nis compared with predictions obtained\n\u03b3\nusing HERWIG, the total predictions of the model being normalised to the data. To\na first approximation, HERWIG describes the shape of the distribution well, despite\nthe QCD calculation being basically at LO. Above xOBS\n\u2248 0.75 a strong direct peak\n\u03b3\nis seen both in the data and the theory. A strong resolved contribution is required.\nThe tail to lower xOBS\nof the HERWIG direct contribution can be attributed to\n\u03b3\neffects of hadronisation and initial-state gluon radiation. The small contribution of\nD\u2217 's arising from b quark production and decay is included.\nTo obtain this reasonable description of the resolved component, the GRV-G\nHO photon pdf was used.28 This has given good results in many photoproduction\nanalyses at HERA. It is possible to separate between the charm-excitation and the\nother charm contributions (e.g. gg \u2192 cc\u0304) in the HERWIG resolved calculation;\nthe latter contributions are very small. The charm-excitation here is believed to\ncome mainly from the photon: its nature is discussed further in section 3.5. The\ncharm excited from the proton ends up mainly at forward angles outside the present\nexperiments' acceptance.49\nA parton-level comparison with the massive NLO calculation of FMNR is unsuccessful (fig. 10b). There is no explicit charm excitation in this calculation, by\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n17\n\ndefinition, and three-flavour pdf's are used. The size of the direct peak is accurately\naccounted for, bearing in mind that gluon radiation pushes some of the events of\ndirect origin into the low-xOBS\ntail. The effects of hadronisation would further in\u03b3\ncrease this tail but are estimated to be small. So it is clear that the low-xOBS\ndata\n\u03b3\nare not described by the FMNR model, even with the desperate recourse of putting\nmc = 1.2 GeV, which would anyway tend to spoil the agreement in the direct peak.\nThis suggests as a conclusion that the fixed flavour-number scheme is inadequate\nin the context of charm photoproduction at moderate pT .\nThis work has been extended by ZEUS, this time using PYTHIA as the reference\nMonte Carlo, in a study of dijet angular distributions in D\u2217 -containing events. The\ndirect process proceeds by quark exchange, while the resolved processes have a\nmixture of exchanges dominated by that of a gluon. These are respectively spin- 12\nand spin-1 exchanges, which have very different distributions in the scattering angle\n\u03b8\u2217 in the dijet rest frame. Experimentally they can be distinguished, to a reasonable\napproximation, by comparing the direct-dominated and resolved-dominated event\nsamples with xOBS\n> 0.75 and < 0.75 respectively.48\n\u03b3\nPreliminary results in fig. 10c show a steep angular rise in the direct-dominated\nevents, in marked contrast to the gentler behaviour of the resolved-dominated\nevents. The agreement with expectations is very satisfactory considering that the\ncalculations are at LO. A next logical step will be to tag the jet with which the\ncharm is associated, and examine the forward and backward distributions of the\ncharm-tagged jets in the two classes of event, in order to study charm excitation in\nthe photon and in the proton in more detail.\n3.4. Open charm in DIS\nThe production of charm in DIS processes is dominated by the LO boson-gluon\nfusion diagram. Both HERA collider experiments have measured the inclusive production of the D\u2217\u00b1 in DIS and have used this to measure F2c , the part of the proton\nstructure function F2 which represents charm production. The method employed is\nto identify the D\u2217\u00b1 signal, correct it to an inclusive D\u2217\u00b1 production cross section in\nbins of x and Q2 , and then use a theoretical model to relate the D\u2217\u00b1 cross section\nto F2c , defined at the parton level. One writes:\nF2c exp (< x >, < Q2 >) =\n\n\u03c3 exp (x, Q2 )\nF c theor (< x >, < Q2 >),\n\u03c3 theor (x, Q2 ) 2\n\n(7)\n\nto obtain an experimental F2c result at bin-averaged values of x, Q2 . The theoretical\nterms take account of the heavy quark fragmentation and the finite phase-space\nacceptance of the cross section measurement. The cross sections are taken to be\nsufficiently smooth-varying so that bin migration effects can be neglected.\nH1 seek to compare their results with predictions from a DGLAP-based evolution\nscheme and also from a CCFM-based scheme.12 To do this, they first make use of\nthe hadronising LO Monte Carlo AROMA50 to evaluate inclusive D\u2217\u00b1 cross sections\nfrom the observed event numbers. They then perform the subsequent calculation of\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n18\n\nF2c (a) in the NLO DGLAP scheme\nH1 NLO QCD\nfit to F2\n\n(1.8)\n(2.5)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3.5 GeV\n\n6.5 GeV\n\n(4)\n\n(7)\n(6.5)\n\nF2c\n0.40\n\n2\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n18 GeV\n\n2\n\n25 GeV\n\n(20)\n\n2\n\n(30)\n(32.5)\n\n0.00\n\n0.40\n\n(60)\n(55)\n\n2\n\n130 GeV\n\n2\n\n565 GeV\n\n2\n\n(100)\n\n2\n\n3.5 GeV\n\n2\n\n2\n\n12 GeV\n\n2\n\n60 GeV\n\nQ = 1.5 GeV\n\n0.20\n\n0.00\n2\n\n6.5 GeV\n\n0.25\n\n0.00\n2\n\n25 GeV\n\nF2\n\n60 GeV\n\nCCFM\n\n0.40\n2\n\n0.00\n12 GeV\n\nF2 (b) in the CCFM scheme\nH1 Preliminary\n\n2\n\nQ = 1.5 GeV2\n\n0.25\n\nc\n\nZEUS semil\nprel\n\nc extracted with CASCADE\n\n0.50\n\nH1\nZEUS\n\n0.40\n\n0.00\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n\nlog x\n\n0.00\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nlog x\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nFig. 11. Structure function F2c (a) measured by H1 and ZEUS using an NLO DGLAP scheme to\ncorrect to full phase space and (b) by H1 using a CCFM-based scheme. The preliminary results\nare compared with the respective theories. The shaded band represents the uncertainty on the c\nquark mass (1.3 - 1.5 GeV). Note that the ZEUS and H1 data are not at identical Q2 values.\n\nF2c in two ways, by means of (a) HVQDIS, which uses DGLAP, and (b) CASCADE,\nwhich uses CCFM. The HVQDIS program51 uses a fixed flavour-number model for\nDIS in which the boson-gluon fusion process is calculated to NLO. The phasespace acceptance correction differs significantly in the two approaches, and so H1\nhave presented two different sets of experimental structure functions (fig. 11), each\ncompared with the absolute predictions of a theory of a type similar to that used\nto perform the correction. The CCFM prediction includes proton gluon densities\nmeasured by H1 in an overall F2 determination using this model. The shaded band\nrepresents the effect of varying the c mass between 1.3 and 1.5 GeV, which is the\ndominant uncertainty, and in the CCFM case the effect also of using a proton gluon\ndensity obtained with an NLO fit to F2 .\nOverall, the CCFM-based calculation describes the data better than the NLODGLAP based calculation,52 the differences appearing at lower values of Q2 and x.\nSimilar conclusions were obtained when comparing the inclusive D\u2217\u00b1 cross sections\nwith these two models.\nIn a like manner, ZEUS have obtained D\u2217\u00b1 cross sections using RAPGAP to\nevaluate the hadronisation corrections and HVQDIS as the parton-level model.13\nThe inclusive cross sections agree well with H1 and with HVQDIS, but a JETSETstyle fragmentation function is required, rather than the Peterson formula, to perform the hadronisation corrections. There are some further technical differences\nfrom the H1 approach. ZEUS also find good agreement between their F2c measurements and results from an NLO QCD fit using ZEUS proton pdf's.53 This is\n\n\f(b)\n_\n\n(a)\n\n19\n\nF2cc/F2\n\n_\n\nF2cc\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\nx\n\nx\n\nQ2 (GeV2)\nFig. 12. (a) Charm structure function measured by ZEUS using an NLO DGLAP scheme to correct\nto full phase space, and compared with a fit using this scheme.13 Uncertainties of around \u00b110%\nin the normalisation due to the luminosity measurement, the charm meson branching ratios and\nthe charm fragmentation function are not included. (b) The ratio of the charm structure function\nto the total structure function F2 .\n\nillustrated in the F2c results plotted as a function of Q2 (fig. 12a) for different values\nof x. The variation of F2c with Q2 - namely, scaling violation - is very much in\nevidence, and is well described globally by the theoretical fit. The uncertainty on\nthe theory (dashed lines) is dominated by that on the c quark mass.\nThe ratio of F2c to F2 is presented by ZEUS in fig. 12b. The fraction of charm\nevents is substantial, owing to the flavour-insensitivity of the boson-gluon fusion\nprocess at high pT . The flattening of the theoretical ratio as x becomes smaller is\na feature of the boson-gluon fusion model: the rising charm production follows the\nrising gluon density in the proton, accompanying the similarly rising quark density\nwhich steers F2 . At high x this mechanism should fail, since the gluon density\nfalls off and the proton has no charm valence quarks. The experimental data are\nconsistent with these theoretical expectations. Overall, therefore, a clear physical\npicture seems to emerge.\nUsing a larger event sample from the period 1998-2000, ZEUS have confirmed\nthat HVQDIS gives a good overall description of the D\u2217\u00b1 production, up to Q2\nvalues of 1000 GeV2 .54 An unexpected observation is apparent in the preliminary\n\n\fxgg(xg)\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n20\n\nH1\n\n20\n\nNLO\n\nD* (DIS)\nD* (\u03b3p)\nQCD fit to F2\nCTEQ4F3\n\n10\n\n\u03bc =25 GeV\n2\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nlog xg\n\nFig. 13. Proton gluon densities obtained from two D \u2217 analysis by H1, namely from photoproduction and from DIS, compared with the gluon density extracted from a QCD fit to F2 data.\n\nresults, namely that the cross sections measured using an incoming electron beam\nare higher than those using a positron beam, although both sets individually remain\nconsistent with HVQDIS. The effect appears highest at high Q2 . No explanation\nfor the difference is yet on offer, and further investigation is required.\nH1 have also extracted the gluon density in the proton on the basis that the\ncharm production cross sections are dominated by the boson-gluon fusion process,\nand hence depend strongly on the proton gluon content. Results46 using D\u2217 data\nfrom photoproduction and DIS are plotted in fig. 13 and are compared with those\nfrom a QCD fit to F2 data. The F2 measurements depend primarily on the coupling\nof the virtual photon to quarks in the proton, with the DGLAP equations generating\nthe gluon distribution in the course of the fitting procedure. The excellent agreement\nseen between the two types of method represents a significant triumph for the\nstandard QCD description of the ep system.\n3.5. Photoproduction-DIS relationship\nTo probe the nature of the charm process further, ZEUS have compared the production of charm in DIS with that in photoproduction.55 Dijet events containing a\nD\u2217\u00b1 meson are selected, for Q2 \u2248 0 and in the range 1.0 to 5000 GeV2 . A value\nof xOBS\nis calculated for each such event, from which the authors evaluate the cross\n\u03b3\nsection ratio between events in xOBS\nbelow and above 0.75, i.e. an approximate\n\u03b3\n\"resolved/direct\" ratio. This is plotted as a function of Q2 , and compared with\ntheoretical predictions in fig. 14.

Jet pairs with ET > 7.5, 6.5 GeV are chosen, and D \u2217 with pT > 3.0 GeV.\nThe results are compared with (a) HERWIG prediction calculated with no charm requirement.\nThe possible effect of acceptance corrections is indicated. (b) HERWIG (with charm requirement)\nusing the SaS1D photon structure with and without suppression of the photon parton structure\nwith Q2 , (b) CASCADE and AROMA,\n\nthe photon. The ratio is found to be approximately constant with Q2 , a behaviour\nwhich contrasts strongly with that found in events lacking a charm requirement,\nand which cannot be accounted for by acceptance effects. Such behaviour is predicted by the Monte Carlos HERWIG, CASCADE and AROMA. With HERWIG,\nthe SaS-1D photon pdf's were used with and without the option of suppressing\nthe hadronic photon contribution with increasing Q2 ; however, the data are not\nyet able to distinguish between these cases. The AROMA prediction is flat, but\nquantitatively too low, while CASCADE gives a good overall description.\nThese observations are consistent with the expectation that, after factorising\nout the proton pdf, the resolved photoproduction of charm takes place mainly\nthrough perturbative QCD mechanisms as does the direct process. Thus the \"resolved/direct\" ratio should not vary rapidly with Q2 . This contrasts with the\nnon-perturbative, hadronic processes which dominate light-quark resolved photoproduction and which show a strong fall-off with Q2 . In other words, we are talking\nabout \"anomalous\" diagrams here, rather than about a charm-containing hadronic\nphoton structure.\nNevertheless, further statistics are clearly required to distinguish between the\ntwo SaS models, and data at higher Q2 will also help.\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n22\n\n3.6. Some theoretical comments\nThe HVQDIS model gives good results, but neglects the intrinsic charm that can\nevolve in the proton, in other words charm excitation processes, and so could have\nproblems for Q2 values above the charm mass squared. However the experiments\ndo not yet seem to be sufficiently precise to be sensitive to such an effect. Also,\nHVQDIS does not attempt to describe cc\u0304 formation from the splitting of outgoing\ngluons, and the formation of final-state J/\u03c8 mesons has been ignored in these\nmeasurements; this contribution is not believed to be at an important level.\nGiven the merits and drawbacks of the existing fixed and variable flavour-number\nschemes, one might obviously wish for a more advanced type of scheme that combines the advantages of both. This would require a model which allows the number\nof active flavours in the proton and photon to vary with Q2 or ET , while also\ntreating the charm quark mass satisfactorily. In a composite approach, each of the\nprevious schemes will dominate in its own particular dynamic range, while a suitable\n\"matching\" is achieved in the intermediate region. A LO model of this type was\nprovided by Aivazis et al. (ACOT).56 Further developments have been presented\nby Collins,57 who showed that the ideas can be made to work at all orders, and by\nAmundson et al. (ASTW),58 who report a program of calculations at NLO. The latter authors provide a Monte Carlo program which can be used by experimentalists.\nAt present ASTW are able to give a good account of the HERA F2c measurements.\nTheir procedure is less successful with the differential inclusive charm meson distributions, owing to a strong sensitivity to an internal scale parameter within the\nmodel; good qualitative agreement is obtained with the data, but the theoretical\nuncertainties are very large. ASTW state an intention to extend their calculations\nto higher order.\nThere are a number of further implementations of these ideas. This approach\noffers a conceptually attractive way forward to a deeper understanding of charm\nproduction, provided that a sufficiently high order calculation can be achieved. In\nprinciple it should be applied also to beauty production.\nIt has been pointed out by Chuvakin et al.59 that the fixed flavour-number\nschemes at NLO are very stable as regards scale variations, and are therefore well\nsuited for the description of DIS processes over a wide Q2 range. On the other\nhand, the cross sections contain large logarithms of the form ln(Q2 /m2 ), and these\ncan be resummed in a variable flavour-number scheme, where the problematic terms\ncan be absorbed into the pdf's. These authors demonstrate that variable flavournumber schemes (BMSN60 and CSN61 ) are able to give good descriptions of D\u2217\nproduction at HERA. However the results of the calculations are very similar to the\nfixed flavour-number calculations of HVQDIS. In view of the latter's moderate scale\ndependence, there may be at present no advantage in moving to the other schemes,\nat least insofar as the Q2 and x description is concerned.\nIt should finally be remarked that considerable care is required in defining F2c\nat the theoretical level.24 For a further discussion of some of the theoretical issues,\nthe account by Harris62 may be consulted.\n\n\fZEUS 96-97\n\n10\n\n-\n\nHERWIG: b \u2192 e (15%)\n\u2013\n\n10\n\n-\n\nHERWIG: c \u2192 e (85%)\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n23\n\nData (prel.)\nFit\nbeauty\ncharm\nfake muons\n\nH1\n\nHERWIG: all processes\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nMuons / 50 \u03bcm\n\nd\u03c3/dpTrel (nb/GeV)\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n(b)\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\npTrel (GeV)\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n0.05\n\u03b4 [ cm ]\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nFig. 15.

Two jets of ET > 5 GeV are required.\n\n4. Open Beauty\nBoth HERA collider experiments have reported measurements of open beauty, i.e.\nthe B family of mesons. The latest H1 results have benefited from the use of a\nsilicon tracking system, and ZEUS will use such a system in future running. In the\nabsence of a precise vertex measurement to help identify the B mesons, with their\nrelatively long lifetime, the most common identification procedure is by means of\ntheir leptonic decays. The high mass of the b quark compared with the c means\nthat the B meson decay products emerge at higher angles relative to the direction\nof outgoing heavy-flavour meson or its jet (fig. 15a).63 Important backgrounds come\nfrom the leptonic decays of D mesons.\nZEUS have used this method to obtain an inclusive B photoproduction cross\nsection, where B denotes all b-quark mesons, taking an inclusive branching ratio\nto electrons. H1 have useed muons,64 and have more recently demonstrated the\neffectiveness of a selection on impact parameter (fig. 15b), presenting preliminary\nmeasurements in both photoproduction65 and DIS.66\nThe results are summarised in fig. 16a. Since the measurements are defined using different experimental acceptances, they are plotted as a ratio of the measured\ncross sections to the predictions at NLO from the HVQDIS program. A Peterson\nfragmentation function was used to calculate B production rates, from which lepton\ncross sections were extracted using the AROMA generator - in other words, a similar method to that used by H1 for their D measurements. The HVQDIS program\nyielded a predicted cross section of 11 \u00b1 2 pb for the production of B hadrons at\nHERA, compared with the H1 DIS measurement of 39 \u00b1 8 \u00b1 10 pb.

Statistical and systematic uncertainties are added\nin quadrature.\n\ngives a prediction of 9 pb and CASCADE, at LO, gave 15pb. The photoproduction\ntheoretical result was calculated using the FMNR program.\nIn short, the integrated B cross sections at HERA lie consistently above the\nNLO theory whenever the experimental errors permit a statement. It is therefore\nworth making comparison with results from other types of experiment. At LEP,\nmeasurements of charm and beauty production have been made in photon-photon\ncollisions by L367 and OPAL.68 The acceptance is evaluated using PYTHIA and\nthe results compared to NLO predictions from Drees et al.69 The charm situation\nis found to be not dissimilar to that at HERA. L3 (16b, top) present charm cross\nsections in overall accord with calculations, bearing in mind the c mass uncertainty.\nOPAL, measuring D\u2217 production with pT between 2 and 12 GeV,70 find that the\nmassless calculation by Binnewies, Kniehl and Kramer42,71 fits the data well, while a\nmassive calculation by Frixione, Kr\u00e4mer and Laenen72 underestimates the data even\nwith mc = 1.2 GeV. The direct process, here referring to \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 q q\u0304, is insufficient to\naccount for the observed signal, and the authors argue that a resolved photon with\nsignificant gluon content is required.\nHowever the beauty rate in L3 is much higher than predicted. The OPAL B cross\nsection, selecting on jets with ET > 3 GeV, is in good agreement with L3, whose\nkinematics are similar. In pp\u0304 collisions at the Tevatron, CDF and D0 have presented\nextensive data on B production73,74 and, again, find that the NLO calculation is an\nunderestimate (fig. 17).75 However it can be seen that at high pT the disagreement\nis less serious, the largest discrepancies bein found at pT <\n\u223c 20 GeV, roughly where\nthe other experiments have obtained their measurements. This region, then, where\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n25\n\nFig. 17. Beauty production at the Tevatron in CDF and D0, compared with an NLO calculation75 .\nThe different points denote different ways of identifying b events; the dashed curves indicate the\ntheoretical uncertainty.\n\nthe momentum scale of the hard scatter is of the same magnitude as that of the b\nquark, is where the main trouble seems to lie.\nThere are suggestions,76 however, that a full treatment of the excitation and\nfragmentation contributions within PYTHIA and HERWIG may enable these models to fit the Tevatron b data even at lower transverse momenta. It is important to\ngenerate all possible final states where jet fragmentation may produce B mesons.\nThe excitation contributions can be substantial, as indicated in a recent analysis\nfrom ZEUS (fig. 18).77 Although the present experimental errors prevent strong\nconclusions from being drawn, a large disagreement with theory is not supported\nby the latter data, although the agreement in the forward direction would be poor\nwithout the excitation component.\nThe value of the b quark mass requires comment. The Particle Data Group78\nquote a value centred on 4.25 GeV at production threshold. In QCD, this mass runs\nwith momentum scale, as confirmed by experiments at LEP.79 However, programs\nsuch as FMNR are based on a different subtraction scheme which requires the \"pole\"\nmass, whose value is a little higher, e.g. 4.5 - 5.0 GeV, and is fixed. The Tevatron\nresults are accompanied by an NLO curve calculated with mB = 4.75 GeV2 , and\nthe dashed curves indicate the uncertainties due to the b mass, the renormalisation\nscale and the Peterson parameter.\nLipatov et al.80 have discussed BFKL-style models which predict the photoproduction cross section for heavy quark-pair production. The essence of these schemes\nis to consider alternative types of gluon distribution to those generated by DGLAP\nevolution. Within the parameter space of this type of approach, these authors are\nable to account for the H1 beauty cross section as well as for the total charm cross\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n60\n\n30\n\n50\n\n25\n\n40\n\n20\n\n30\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n26\n\n5\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFig. 18.

A further account is\ngiven by Baranov, Lipatov and Zotov,81 who demonstrate that such models are able\nto describe the Tevatron b production cross sections, again provided that suitable\nvariants of the theory are selected.\nAlthough this sounds promising, it is not yet clear that any one implementation\nof the theory is capable of describing the data from all the experiments. To get\nthe H1 B cross section right, the BFKL model requires a b-quark mass value of\n4.25 GeV,80 which is a little low, while the \"semihard\" LRSS model82 is good for\nboth ZEUS and H1, but overshoots the CDF and D0 data if the same parameter\nset is used. The CASCADE Monte Carlo is able to give a good description of the\nTevatron data,83,23 and, as seen, is fairly satisfactory with ZEUS but not H1. In\nthis model, initial-state gluon radiation gives rise to many low-xOBS\nevents. The\n\u03b3\nauthors tend to believe that the H1 and ZEUS data are in disagreement.\nAt present a summary of this fluid situation is difficult: clearly, b-quark production provides an testing-ground for a variety of theoretical ideas. As these develop,\nand as the experimental errors from H1 and ZEUS decrease, we may expect to\nachieve serious discrimination between the different approaches.\n\n5. Inclusive Quarkonium Production\nThe production of cc\u0304 and bb\u0304 mesons has been the subject of extensive study at\nHERA. Specifically, we are referring to the J/\u03c8 meson (i.e. the \u03c8(1S) state), the\nradially excited \u03c8 \u2032 (or \u03c8(2S)), and the set of analogous \u03a5 states for the bb\u0304 system.\nThe present section discusses the inclusive production of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) states\nin photoproduction and DIS. Like the production of open charm and beauty, this\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n27\n\nFig. 19. Dimuon mass spectra in H1 photoproduction.84 The full 1996-97 data sample is shown\n(top), followed by the selection used for the inelastic J/\u03c8 measurement and the \u03c8\u2032 (2S) measurement. The \u03b3p centre-of-mass energy range is 40 - 180 GeV.\n\nprovides an interesting workshop for the study of QCD mechanisms. Experimentally, the J/\u03c8 is conveniently studied at HERA only in its \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 decays,\nbut these are fully adequate to identify the particle with reasonable statistics.\nThe other main area of quarkonium physics at HERA is in the diffractive production of vector states q q\u0304 V through the \"elastic\" mechanism \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 V p. This will\nbe discussed in Section 6; at HERA, it is only in these processes that the bb\u0304 states\nhave so far been detected.\n5.1. Production of cc\u0304 mesons\nIn inclusive cc\u0304 processes at HERA there is no necessity for the bound quark pairs\nto appear in vector states; however only the vector J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) states have been\nactually identified experimentally. Figure 19 illustrates the signals observed in these\nchannels by H1.84\nAs with the production of open heavy quark systems, these processes are modelled theoretically in two stages: (a) a hard QCD subprocess, which is calculable\nperturbatively and in which the production of the cc\u0304 pair is described, and (b) a\nsoft hadronisation stage where there is a certain probability for a given hadron to\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\nbe formed. This may be represented as\nX\nd\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 HX) =\nd\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 qh q\u0304h (n) + x) OH (n)\n\n28\n\n(8)\n\nn\n\nin which a series of intermediate qh q\u0304h states, labelled n, are considered, and each has\na certain matrix element OH (n) for transition into the chosen hadronic state H. The\nperturbatively calculable subprocess acts at a momentum scale given by the mass of\nthe qh q\u0304h system, or the pT of the scatter if higher; it is a short-distance, fast process.\nThe intermediate qh q\u0304h system may be in a number of angular momentum states,\nand is produced in one of two colour states, namely singlet or octet. If necessary,\nsoft gluon radiation ensures the colour-neutrality of the final-state particles.\nA specific implementatiion of this scheme uses the so-called non-relativistic QCD\nor NRQCD approach.85,86 The initial QCD calculation having first been performed,\nthis effective field theory model allows the OH (n) factors to be expressed in terms\nof known powers of v, the velocity of the heavy quark in the quarkonium system,\nwhich should not be too large. The matrix elements are otherwise not calculable\nfrom first principles. However, they should be independent of the original QCD\nprocess that formed the q q\u0304 state, and the hope is that by measuring experimental\ncross sections in one context we can obtain information on OH (n) terms which can\nbe applied in another.\nThe chief experimental questions at HERA concern:\n\u2022 The relative importance of the colour-octet state, or even whether it is important at all;\n\u2022 The effective value of the mass of the c quark;\n\u2022 The need for higher-order QCD calculations.\nThere are expectations that the method will work better for bb\u0304 systems than cc\u0304\nsystems since the non-relativistic approximations will be more accurate.\nFurther details have been given by Frixione et al.18 and in an extensive review\nby Kr\u00e4mer.87 This is a situation where several QCD momentum scales apply in\nthe same event, and in particular it is assumed that mq v \u226b \u039bQCD . In general,\nthe power of v which multiplies the matrix elements depends on the relative size of\nmq v, mq v 2 and \u039bQCD .\nThe simplest version of these ideas is the colour-singlet model, in which colouroctet (CO) terms are neglected, since they are suppressed by a power of v 4 compared\nto the simplest colour-singlet (CS) term. However they are multiplied by a colour\nfactor of 8 and have a different pT dependence, so that their unimportance cannot\nbe taken for granted. Theoretically, the octet terms are required in order to remove\ncertain infra-red divergences due to soft gluon emission. For best accuracy, one\nwould wish the sum in (8) to include as many terms as possible. In practice,\nit is not possible to determine more than a small number of the OH (n) factors\nby experiment, and so the hope is that a model with just a few terms included\nwill be able to test the assumption of their universality to sufficient accuracy to\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b3 P \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X)/dz (nb)\n10\n\n29\n\ntotal\n\n\u221as\u03b3P = 100 GeV; pT > 1 GeV\n\n3\n\nH1 (prelim.)\nZEUS (prelim.)\n\n10 2\n\nCO-direct\n\nCO-res.\nCS-direct\n\n10\n\nCS-res.\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nz\nFig. 20.

H1 have in addition made the first observations of the \u03c8 \u2032 in this channel.\nCross sections are given in terms of the pT of the J/\u03c8, its centre-of-mass rapidity\ny \u2217 = 21 ln(E + pz )/(E \u2212 pz ) and its inelasticity z = P * P\u03c8 /P * q.

For z > 0.3, the theoretical cross sections are dominated\nby the direct process, with the CO contribution becoming increasingly dominant as\nz increases.

Figure\n20(right) shows results that are in excellent agreement with the LO curves, although the theories quoted here and previously are not identical. The presence of\nthe resolved photon contribution seems clearly required.\nIt is evident that, while not in disagreement with the LO theory, the data lie\nat the low edge of the predicted range for CS + CO, and at the high edge (if a\nsimilar error band is allowed) for CS alone. The same data are compared to a NLO\ncalculation in fig. 21(a,b), where good agreement is found with a CS prediction\nalone, although the normalisation uncertainties are again large.

H1 DIS ep cross sections for various distributions in inclusive J/\u03c8 production (open circles), to be compared with the AROMA histogram, and for inelastic (MX > M 10 GeV) production\n(solid circles), to be compared with NRQCD curves from Fleming and Mehen.93\n\nZEUS89 have also compared their results with a NLO CS calculation91 and with a\nLO CS calculation supplemented by a LO CO model using fits from CDF and from\nCLEO data. The conclusions are similar: NLO CS succeeds, the others sometimes\nsucceed and sometimes fail, but the theoretical uncertainties are large. Clearly, this\ndoes not yet amount to a powerful test of these ideas, especially for the presence\nof the CO term. The pT distribution (fig. 21c) demonstrates the importance of\nan NLO calculation. It includes terms which are dominated by t-channel gluon\nexchange and scale as pT 6 instead of pT 8 , but similar t-channel exchanges occur in\nthe LO CO contribution.\nIn an analysis of DIS J/\u03c8 production,92 H1 have presented results with and\nwithout a mass cut which effectively removes most events at z > 0.9, where the\nelastic and CO effects are largest (fig. 22). They find that the CO contribution,\nas calculated by Fleming and Mehen,93 still dominates the remaining phase space.\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n32\n\nFragmentation is not included in this LO calculation. The CS term is inadequate to\ndescribe the data, but including the CO term makes the total too high. H1 attribute\nthese discrepancies to the matrix elements OH used in the calculation. Meanwhile\nthe Soft Colour Interaction model,94 calculated in AROMA, is inadequate at the\nquantitative level, although the shapes of most of the distributions are described\nreasonably well.\nOne path to a better test of these ideas is to measure the polarisation of the\nJ/\u03c8, where the effects of the CO terms should be more unambiguously visible.91 It\nwould also be interesting to make an approximate separation between the resolved\nand direct contributions, by means of x\u03b3 , using the events with a J/\u03c8 jet and a\ngluon jet.\nThe production of \u03c8 \u2032 (2S) has been measured by H1 relative to that for J/\u03c8 in\nthe same kinematic range of inelastic photoproduction.84 The cross section ratio was\nfound to be 0.210 \u00b1 0.048 \u00b1 0.032 (preliminary). A substantial fraction of observed\nJ/\u03c8 mesons can be direct or indirect decay products of \u03c8 \u2032 (2S) mesons. Allowing\nfor this, H1 calculate the ratio of \u03c8 \u2032 (2S) to directly produced J/\u03c8 as 0.24 \u00b1 0.08, in\nagreement with an expectation of 0.15.91\nThe NRQCD model is itself being developed and studied, with a variety of ideas\non the market.95 These will in due course invite further experimental test.\n\n6. Diffractive Processes\nThe final topic of this survey concerns the diffractive production of heavy quark\nsystems at HERA. As illustrated in fig. 2d, such processes occur through the photon first fluctuating into a hadronic state V , where V must preserve the quantum\nnumbers of the photon. The assumption of vector meson dominance asserts that\nthe relevant hadronic states are the members of the vector meson family, namely the\nL = 1 q q\u0304 mesons \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8, \u03a5 etc. The state V may interact inelastically with\nthe proton, but the Optical Theorem requires the existence of an elastic channel,\nin which the fluctuation \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 V is followed by the elastic process V p \u2192 V p and\nthe V emerges on mass shell. A full theory must also take into account excitation\nprocesses whereby the V or proton may emerge in an excited state.\nFrom a QCD standpoint, the essential feature of diffractive processes is that\nin the primary scatter, the exchanged object is colour-neutral (colour-singlet). At\nHERA, this condition permits the proton to remain intact, to end up in an excited\nnucleon state, or to become dissociated. However there must be no transfer of colour\nthat requires subsequent neutralisation by the generation of a string of hadrons\nalong the rapidity range between the forward nucleon system and the remainder\nof the event. This rapidity range usually ends up underpopulated or unpopulated,\ntherefore; in fact a so-called \"large rapidity gap\" is commonly found in the forward\nregion of a diffractive event.\nDiffractive processes may be interpreted either in terms of Regge theory, where\nthe exchanged object is a pseudoparticle with the quantum numbers of a vacuum,\nknown as a pomeron, or else in terms of QCD models with the typical exchange of\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\ne\n\n33\n\ne\nq\nq\n\np\n\np\n\nFig. 23. QCD-modelled production of a vector meson in elastic diffraction (from ZEUS96 ).\n\ntwo or more gluons (fig. 23). We shall here, for convenience, refer to the exchanged\nentity generically as a \"pomeron\".\nAn account of heavy quark production in diffractive ep scattering must place it\nagainst the backdrop of what is now a broad area of \"pomeron\" physics. Indeed,\nthe manifestations of the pomeron radiated from the proton parallel in many ways\nthe behaviour of the photon radiated from the positron. The pomeron is hadronic,\nand it may display parton structure and give rise to \"resolved\" interactions. In\nthe present context, though, we regard it simply as an exchanged object with a\npossibly complex nature, capable of being modelled in various ways. In the elastic\nphotoproduction of vector mesons the pomeron exchange is a soft process so long\nas the vector mesons are made of light quarks. However, when cc\u0304 or bb\u0304 mesons\nare produced, the process cannot be entirely soft from a QCD viewpoint, and so\nits characteristics change. The situation gives rise to the possibility of perturbative\nQCD (pQCD) calculations.\nIn the elastic photoproduction of \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons, the fluctuation into a vector\nmeson is taken to occur before the scatter off the proton. For the vector meson to\nremain intact, the scattering process must then be essentially soft. In the QCDmodelled process (fig. 23), the photon couples to a virtual q q\u0304 pair, which exchanges\ngluons with the proton, and then finally the emerging q q\u0304 pair may hadronise into\na vector meson. In elastic vector-meson production, the coupling to the proton\nselects the latter's gluon content at low mean values of Bjorken x. Since W 2 \u221d 1/x,\nhigher W means lower x, corresponding to a rapidly increasing gluon density in\nthe proton pdf (fig. 13). One expects to observe in general, therefore, that elastic\ncross sections will increase strongly with W if perturbative QCD is operating. In\nthe Regge approach, a weak rise with W is expected.97\nThus the important difference between the elastic photoproduction of light and\nheavy vector mesons is that the production mechanism of the former is fundamentally \"soft\" at all stages, whereas the latter require a \"hard\" phase initially. The\nsituation changes in DIS. The elastic formation of even a light vector meson from\nan incoming highly virtual photon, with Q2 \u226b mV requires a hard vertex somewhere, which renders the process in part perturbatively calculable while depressing\nthe cross section.\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\nH1 93/94\nZEUS 95\n\n4\n\n*\n\n10\n\nE665\nNMC\n\n\u03c3\u03b3* p \u2192 \u03c1 p [nb]\n\n\u03c3tot (\u03b3 p \u2192 \u03c1p) [nb]\n\nLow energy photoproduction\nZEUS 94 photoproduction\n\n10\n\n3\n\nZEUS\nQ [GeV ]\n0.\n\n\u03b4 (\u00b1 stat.)\n0.16\u00b10.06\n\n0.47\n\n0.12\u00b10.03\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0.33\u00b10.05\n0.38\u00b10.05\n0.56\u00b10.10\n0.52\u00b10.09\n0.46\u00b10.10\n\n2.5\n3.5\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n34\n\n6.0\n8.3\n\n2\n\n13.0\n\n10\n\n0.88\u00b10.28\n\n27.0\n1\n\n10\n\nZEUS 94\nZEUS 95\nZEUS (Prel.) 96-97 \u03c1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100 125 150 175 200 225\n\nW [GeV]\n\n10\n\n2\n\nZEUS (prel.)

Measurements of vector charmonium\nThe interplay of the different hard scales in diffractive vector meson production\nis illustrated in the sets of total elastic cross sections shown in fig. 24. In the\nfirst two plots, earlier96 and more recent98 ZEUS results on \u03c1 production as a\nfunction of W are compared with H1. In the third plot, J/\u03c8 data are presented.99\nRecent H1 \u03c1 results100 are in agreement with ZEUS; the agreement seen in the\nJ/\u03c8 case is likewise reasonable. The cross sections are presented for the cases of\nphotoproduction (Q2 = 0) and for DIS at various Q2 values. At a given value of Q2\nthe W -dependence of the total cross sections can be parameterised as W \u03b4 , where \u03b4\nis a power to be measured experimentally.\nIn the case of \u03c1 photoproduction, the data over a wide range of W are well fitted\nby the Regge-theory formalism of Donnachie and Landshoff,97 and indicate \u03b4 values\nin the range 0.12 to 0.16 at low Q2 . As Q2 rises, \u03b4 increases to values in the range\n0.4 to 0.9, but with a large error for the highest Q2 data set. The J/\u03c8 data sets,\nin contrast, show a large value of \u03b4 already at Q2 = 0. A value of \u03b4 in the range\n0.6 - 0.8 is indicated, with no evidence from H1 and ZEUS for variation with Q2 .\nThe suggestion is that by the time Q2 has reached a suitably high value, a common\ntype of hard behaviour may be found in this W range.\nIn the fourth plot,101 J/\u03c8 data at Q2 = 0 are combined and compared with\npQCD predictions using different proton pdf sets,102 all of which give good fits to\nthe proton structure function F2 . The data show a clear sensitivity to the pdf set\n- that is, to its gluon component - and suggest a preference for one of them.\nHowever this should be treated with caution since the two models chosen, FKS and\nMRT,103,104 have large uncertainties on their normalisation. They differ in their\ntreatment of the gluon distributions in the photon, and in the description of the\ncharmonium state. Overall, these models may be said to confirm the shape of the\nvariation with W , and the general validity of the pQCD approach to this topic. The\nFKS model describes the data well when renormalised by a factor of \u2248 1.6.\nThe coupling of the photon to the vector mesons V is through their quarks; the\nquark content of the \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons predicts total elastic cross sections\nfor \u03b3p \u2192 V p in the respective ratios 1 : 91 : 29 : 98 : 29 , respectively, if flavour\nindependence otherwise applies. For five quark types, this is referred to as SU(5)\nsymmetry. The \u03c9 : \u03c1 cross section ratio is found to be in good agreement with this\nprediction, both in photoproduction and DIS.105\nHowever at Q2 = 0 both the \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 cross sections are lower than predicted.\nThis must be attributed to different production mechanisms, even the \u03c6 being\nsufficiently heavier than the \u03c1 and \u03c9 to follow significantly different dynamics. To\nexpect SU(5) symmetry to hold, we must operate in a kinematic regime where\nuniform production mechanisms operate, and it would appear necessary that this\nbe either one where all the mechanisms are soft, or one where pQCD applies but\nquark mass effects are unimportant. In the latter case this means there must be\na hard momentum scale considerably greater than \u039bQCD and the vector meson\nmasses.\n\n\f(b)\n0.5\n\nZEUS (prel.) DIS 96-99\nZEUS (prel.)

More high-|t| data are desirable to confirm this to greater\nprecision. The corresponding ratios for the purely elastic \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 production\nhave also been measured by ZEUS:107 they are consistent with expectations but\nthe experimental errors are substantial.\nLikewise, the total cross section ratio for \u03c6 relative to \u03c1 plateaus to a ratio of 2/9\nwhen Q2 exceeds about 6 GeV (which seems to be a higher value than in the case\nof t, indicating that \u2212t and Q2 are not equivalent scales).108,109 For J/\u03c8, the data\nare too sparse at present to make a definite statement; however there is a steady\nrising trend with Q2 , and an asymptotic value of 8/9 is possible (fig. 25b).\nH1 have argued108 (fig. 26) that a universal curve can be plotted through all\nthe total cross sections for \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 V p. The plotted results were taken at a fixed W\nvalue of 75 GeV and the different cross section values were scaled by the reciprocal\nof their respective SU(5) factors, as listed above.

It works for \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 production, but\nfails for J/\u03c8 production when the matter is studied in detail. Taken over a broad\nW range, and at a series of (Q2 + m2V ) values, the scaled J/\u03c8 cross sections are\nconsistently higher by around 50% than the light meson data. At least SU(5) is\nbroken.\nAs well as scattering elastically in diffractive processes, the virtual photon may\ndissociate into an unbound q q\u0304 system. ZEUS have presented measurements of\nD\u2217 production in such processes, both for photoproduction and DIS.111,112 The\nkinematical distributions, at present with large errors, are approximately consistent\nwith boson-gluon fusion in resolved-pomeron predictions using RAPGAP.114 H1\nhave measured this process in DIS113 and have obtained satisfactory agreement\nwith QCD model predictions.

Light vector mesons have b \u2248 10 GeV\u22122 .\nThere is already a difficulty here in J/\u03c8 photoproduction, because a value b \u2248 4\nGeV\u22122 is measured (fig. 27a), which would give \u03b4 \u2248 0.1, while the measured value of\n\u03b4 is around 0.8; in other words the actual W dependence is steeper than the Regge\nformula requires. On the other hand, if pQCD were the whole story, we should not\nexpect to see shrinkage in the J/\u03c8 differential cross section, since in pQCD the W\nand t dependences are not coupled.116 From fig. 27b it is evident that shrinkage is\nindeed observed.101 This implies non-perturbative physics, which is good news for\nRegge theory.\nNevertheless, the W dependence represents a problem. In order to rescue Regge\ntheory, Donnachie and Landshoff have proposed a \"hard\" pomeron117 as well as\nthe familiar \"soft\" one which describes light vector meson production well.118 The\nhard pomeron has \u03b1(0) \u2248 1.4 while the soft one still has \u03b1(0) \u2248 1.08. However,\nthe experimental t variation gives an intercept of \u03b1(0) = 1.193 \u00b1 0.011 +0.015\n\u22120.010 . This\nagrees with a BFKL calculation,119 but with neither the soft nor the hard pomeron\non its own.\n\n\f-2\n\nd\u03c3\u03b3p/dt [nb GeV ]\n\nHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n39\n\nH1 Preliminary\npQCD (\u03b1s=0.221)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n2\n\n|t| [GeV ]\n\nFig. 28. Differential cross section in |t| for J/\u03c8 production in DIS with proton dissociation (H1).\nA QCD-based theoretical prediction is shown.\n\nIn a more complex approach one may attempt to combine the two types of\npomeron. The above authors and H1 have shown that a fit involving both pomerons\nis able to describe the observed variation of the cross section with W .118,120 If this\nis becoming a little complicated, perhaps the pomeron is complicated.\nOne aspect of simple Regge theory which is found to hold in J/\u03c8 production is\ns-channel helicity conservation (SCHC). This has been reported by ZEUS from an\nanalysis of the relevant spin density-matrix elements using the angular distributions\nof the J/\u03c8 decay products.99\n6.3. Proton dissociation\nIn diffractive events at high momentum transfers t, the proton can dissociate\nwhile the vector meson still emerges elastically, i.e. with no additional associated\nfinal-state products. Recent ZEUS measurements of this process have already been\ndiscussed.106 In J/\u03c8 photoproduction, H1 have made a study121 selecting events in\nwhich the proton dissociates into a final state with a mass in the approximate range\n1.6 - 30 GeV, as measured in their forward calormeter system. The value of t is\nobtained from the transverse momentum of the measured J/\u03c8. The pQCD-based\nevent generator HITVM122 describes the W and the t distributions well (fig. 28).\nThe shape of the variation with t appears to be independent of W ; at given t the\ncross sections rise as W \u03b4 with \u03b4 \u2248 1.\n6.4. \u03c8(2S) production\nH1 have measured the elastic production of the \u03c8(2S) state both in photoproduction and in DIS.123,92 The decay channel \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was used, and the results include the contribution from proton dissociation. A colour-dipole based QCD\nprediction124 describes the data well (fig. 29). There is also a prediction116 that for\nQ2 \u226b m2J/\u03c8 , the ratio of the elastic \u03c8(2S) and J/\u03c8 cross sections should tend to\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n(b)\n\u03c3\u03c8(2S) / \u03c3J/\u03c8\n\n(a)\n\n40\n\n0.4\nSLAC\n\nEMC\n\nNA14\n\nNMC\n\nE401\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nH1\n\nZEUS (prel.) 95-97 \u03bc+\u03bcZEUS (prel.) 99-00 e+e-\n\n0\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nW (GeV)\n\nFig. 29.

ZEUS have measured \u03c8(2S) production through the e+ e\u2212 decay channel and\nobtain a result that is consistent with H1 and with lower energy experiments.125\n6.5. Measurements of bb\u0304\nThe \u03a5 family are the only bb\u0304 states measured at HERA, and have been observed\nonly in the elastic channel in photoproduction and DIS, through their \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays.\nThe dimuon spectrum from H1 is illustrated in fig. 30a.120 A \u03a5 enhancement is\nseen with a little difficulty above a background due to the Bethe-Heitler process\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , where one of the photons is radiated from the proton. ZEUS have\nobserved a similar signal.126 The mass resolution is not sufficient to separate the\n\u03a5(1S), (2S) and (3S) states, which cover the mass range 9.46 - 10.36 GeV, and so\nthe signal-background subtraction is performed over a range that covers all three\nresonances together.\nThe cross section is evaluated assuming that the standard branching rate to\nmuons applies to all three channels and taking 70% of the signal as \u03a5(1S). The\nresults from the two experiments are shown in fig. 30b, compared with QCD-based\ncalculations by Martin, Ryskin and Teubner (MRT)104 and by Frankfurt, McDermott and Strikman (FMS).127 Within present errors, these models all describe the\ndata. A calculation by FKS103 was found by ZEUS to be too low.\n\n7. Conclusions\nThe HERA collider offers a rich breadth of perspectives through which many areas\nof particle physics can be studied, and in so doing stands as an experimental facility\nunmatched in the world. This is particularly the case in the study of QCD processes,\nwhere the production of heavy quark systems provides a laboratory for the probing\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n41\n\na)\nb)\n\nFig. 30.

(b) \u03a5 total cross section in photoproduction: HERA results\ncompared to theory.\n\nof many important details of the theory. Mesons containing charm quarks have\nbeen extensively measured, and a start has been made on the study of beauty\nmeson production. These measurements have made a useful start in distinguishing\nbetween different perturbative and semi-perturbative QCD models. Nevertheless it\nis clear that better experimental statistics at HERA will be exremely valuable in\nthe study of charm physics, and indispensible for the study of beauty. The ability\nto study the production of B and \u03a5 mesons at transverse momenta of the same\norder as the heavy quark mass \u2013 yet still \"hard\" compared with \u039bQCD \u2013 can give\npenetrating tests of theoretical ideas.\nAlthough the available energies are not as high as at the Tevatron, and top\nquark pairs lie outside HERA's reach, the recent improvements to the HERA collider, together with a variety of enhancements in the experiments, make for exciting\nprospects in this area. Following the machine upgrades, a factor of up to ten in integrated luminosity may be achieved by 2005. No serious evidence against QCD has\nbeen found at HERA, but the phenomenological implementations of the theoretical\nideas do not yet seem to be perfect. An important onus lies on the theoreticians to\nprovide an understanding of these areas of QCD that will match the quantity and\nquality of the promised experimental data.\nAcknowledgements\nI should like to express appreciation of the many fruitful contacts with colleagues\nin ZEUS and H1 over the years, which have greatly deepened my understanding of\nQCD physics at HERA, and with particular thanks to D. H. Saxon for a critical\nreading of the manuscript. I am also grateful to S. Frixione for informative help.\n\n\fHeavy Flavour Physics at HERA. . .\n\n42\n\nReferences\n1. H1 Collab., Nucl. Instr.
