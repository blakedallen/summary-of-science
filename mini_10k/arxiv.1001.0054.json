Introduction\nIn the past, game theory and cryptography were developed independently\nof one another, deemed different both in their aims and assumptions. The first discipline\nmodels the behavior of firms and other entities in situations such as manufacturing,\ndecisions of collusion, etc. It assumes that each party acts rationally, or in its own selfinterest. Conversely, cryptography is concerned solely with secure transactions. The\nassumption is that the parties transacting with one another follow, to the point of\nirrationality, certain security protocols or cryptographic systems. The cryptanalyst, or\nhacker, feverishly and arbitrarily attempts to discover the content of these transactions\nusing methods such as brute-forcing, birthday attacks, etc. Furthermore, they are believed\nto have access to extremely sophisticated equipment. No thought is given as to whether\nor not the utility of the information is greater than the resources used to illicitly obtain it.\nHence, the dogmatic determination of the cryptanalyst is unfounded in certain instances.\nDespite these differences, there is currently an intersection in the research\nof game theory and cryptography. Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this\npartnership. First there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Here, we use\nthe assumptions of the former to derive new, possibly more realistic, security protocols.\nAs the paper by Katz states:\n\"Traditionally, cryptographic protocols are designed under the assumption\nthat some parties...faithfully follow the protocol, while some parties are\nmalicious and behave in an arbitrary fashion. The game theoretic\nperspective, however, is that all parties are simply rational and behave in\ntheir own best interests. This viewpoint is incomparable to the\ncryptographic one: although no one can be trusted to follow the protocol\n\n1\n\n\f(unless it is in their own best interests), the [game-theoretic] protocol need\nnot prevent 'irrational' behavior.\" [1]\nThat is, these protocols need not take into account what is considered as irrational\nbehavior. For instance, if the amount of work required to break the standard is greater\nthan the value of any data it protects, the protocol may be considered as totally secure.\nThis paper is primarily concerned with examining the second aspect of\nthis union; the application of cryptography to game theory. Specifically, there exist a\nbranch of non-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium (both will be\ndescribed in detail in the next section) as their solution. These equilibria tend to offer\nmore advantages compared to the more conventional Nash equilibria. Namely, they offer\n\"better payoffs than Nash [equilibria].\"[2] Additionally, these solutions \"have payoffs\noutside the convex hull of all Nash equilibria, and therefore give more options to\nplayers.\"[1] The primary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a\nmediator within the game. This is simply a neutral entity, trusted by all parties involved\nin the game. It is the role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy\nprofiles to all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. All transactions which\nthe players have with this entity are, of necessity, private. Each party privately provides\nthe mediator with the necessary information, and the mediator tells them and them alone\ntheir optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a multitude of situations in which\nno mediator could exist. Correspondingly, games modeling these sorts of cases could not\nuse these entities as tools for analysis. Yet, if these equilibria are in the best interest of\nplayers, it would be rational to simply construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them.\nOf course, for this machine to be used, there would need to be some standard for secure\ntransmission between player and machine. The requirement that no third party (namely\nother players) could detect either the input or strategy profile of a player would need to be\nsatisfied by this scheme. This is the synthesis of cryptography into game theory;\nanalyzing the ability of the players to construct a protocol which can be used successfully\nin the place of a mediator. Specifically, the work of Dodis, Halevi, and Rabin, in this\nregard will be examined. [3]\nII. Basic Game Theoretic Concepts\nCentral to the discussion of this paper is the non-cooperative normal form\ngame. Imagine such a game, \u03a7, is being played by n players, the ith of which is denoted\n\nby Pi . Then, it is entirely described as follows: \u03a7 = {( S i ) in=1 , (u i ) in=1 }, where\nS i = {s i1 ,...., s ik } and u i = S1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 S n \u2192 \u0001. Let S i indicate the strategy set for Pi , and\nthe s il \u2208 S i represent the actual strategies. Hence, an outcome is simply the n-tuple\nv = ( s1a ,..., s nb ). Additionally, u i is the utility function for Pi ; u i (v) is the utility derived\nfrom the outcome v by i. Because this is a non-cooperative game, the following\nrestriction is imposed: \"it is assumed that each participant acts independently, without\ncollaboration or communication with any of the others.\" [4]\nHowever, non-cooperative normal form games in and of themselves are\nnot important to this piece. Instead, their significance is derived from their ability to be\nextended to what are called mediated games. A mediated game, \u03a8 , is exactly as was\ndescribed above. It relies on the presence of a mediator, M, a neutral and mutually trusted\n\n2\n\n\ffigure. The existence of M causes the given non-cooperative normal form game, \u03c7 , to be\nseparated into two stages. Firstly, M examines a known probability distribution D over a\nset of outcomes, which is dependent upon certain inputs from all the players. From this\ndistribution, they select some vector of actions, an outcome a = ( s1* ,..., s n* ). The\nstrategy s i* is then recommended privately by M to Pi . As is stated by Hart and Mas-Colell\n\"Each player is given-privately-instructions for his own play only.\" [5] The second stage\nnow occurs. The game \u03c7 proceeds as before, with each player selecting some strategy\nfrom their strategy set. Of course, the convention is that each party utilizes the\nrecommended strategy. A correlated equilibrium for \u03c7 occurs when it is rational for each\nentity to play their recommendation. Let u i ( si\u2032 , s \u2212*i | k ) be the expected utility for Pi of\nplaying s i\u2032 \u2208 S i as opposed to the recommendation s i* , given that all other parties play their\nrecommendations. Then, a correlated equilibrium occurs only when\nu i ( s i\u2032 , s \u2212*i | k ) \u2264 u i ( si* , s \u2212*i | k ) for all players and elements of their strategy sets. This is\nechoed in the following theorem*.\nTheorem One \u2013 Define \u03a7 = {( S i ) in=1 , (u i ) in=1 }. Then, a distribution D leads\nto a correlated equilibrium if and only if for all k = ( s1 j ,..., s nt ) created from\n\nD by M, all Pi , and all s i\u2032 \u2208 S i , the condition u i ( si\u2032 , s \u2212*i | k ) \u2264 u i ( s i* , s \u2212*i | k )\nholds.\nIII. The benefits of a Correlated Equillibrium\nThe concept of a correlated equilibrium was constructed by mathematician\nAumann partially to address his numerous critiques of Nash equilibria. Among these\ncritiques is a general unattractiveness of the equilibrium, strange assumptions, nearly\ncircular reasoning, etc. He lists them succinctly as follows:\n\"Now why should any player assume that the other players will play their\ncomponents of such an n-tuple [(one of) the Nash equilibria of a game],\nand indeed why should they? This is particularly perplexing when, as\noften happens, there are multiple equilibria; but it has considerable force\neven when the equilibrium is unique. Indeed, there are games whose Nash\nequilibria appear quite unattractive even though they are unique...In a\ntwo-person game, for example, Player 1 would play his component only if\nhe believes that 2 will play his; this in turn would be justified only by 2's\nbelief that 1 will indeed play his component...To many this will sound\nlike a plain old circular argument: consistent, perhaps, but hardly\ncompelling. Nash [equilibria do] make sense if one starts by assuming\nthat, for some specified reason, each player knows which strategies the\nother players are using.\"[6]\nRegardless of the validity of these critiques, correlated equilibria do in fact offer\nnumerous advantages over the more conventional Nash equilibria. Firstly, it has been said\nby many that \"correlated equilibrium may be the most relevant non-cooperative solution\nconcept.\" [5] This characteristic is derived from an alternative, but equivalent\n*\n\nA rigorous proof of this theorem can be found in [1].\n\n3\n\n\fformulation of the equilibrium. Namely, a game \u0393, an extension of \u03a7, is considered in\nwhich there are n players, each of whom receives a private signal (which does not\nnecessarily originate from a mediator) at the game's beginning. These signals then serve\nas the basis for a player's actions, and the game continues as normal. The Nash\nequilibrium derived for \u0393 is simply the correlated equilibrium for \u03a7. Yet, this calculation\nis much simpler than finding the Nash equilibrium for \u03a7. This is because \"with the\nexception of well-controlled environments, it is hard to exclude a priori that...signals are\namply available to the players, and thus find their way [easily] into a [Nash] equilibrium\n[for \u0393] .\" [5] That is, the Nash equilibrium for \u0393 almost naturally arises (not so for \u03a7 ),\nfrom which the correlated equilibrium to \u03a7 may be derived almost effortlessly. Hence, the\ncorrelated equilibria are quire relevant to non-cooperative games in the sense that they\nare simple to compute.\nApart from an ease of computation, there are many instances in which\nthese equilibria offer greater imputations to all players than the Nash equilibrium might:\n\"In some games there may exist a correlated equilibrium that, for every party Pi , gives a\n\nbetter payoff to Pi than any Nash equilibrium.\"[1] Additionally, a larger range of\nequilibrium strategies are afforded to each player under this paradigm. This is indicated\nby the nature of the topological spaces which both sorts of equilibria inhabit. The set of\ncorrelated equilibria for a game, \u03a9, create a convex polytope. The set of Nash\nequilibria, \u039e, also defines a convex polytope. However, this set is of a much more\ncomplex and restricted nature, since it consists entirely of n-tuples which are fixed points.\nAdditionally, let Ei = {\u03c0 i (l) : l \u2208 \u039e} denote the set of all Nash equilibrium strategies\nfor Pi . Then, \"the sets [ E1 , E 2 ,..., E n ] of equilibrium strategies in a solvable game are\npolyhedral convex subsets of the respective mixed strategy spaces.\"\u2020[4] In this, another\nrestriction is imposed upon the possible equilibrium strategies for a given player under\nthe scheme of Nash equilibria. Yet, none of these constraints pertain to the correlated\nequilibrium or its equilibrium strategies. In brief, it offers \"more options to the\nplayers.\"[1]\nIV. The Artificial Mediator\nOstensibly, the most necessary requirement for a correlated equilibrium is\nthat all parties involved rely upon a mediator. This referee, as was briefly stated above,\nmust have no vested interest in the outcomes of the game; the mediator must be a\nmutually trusted, external entity. It is easy to think of many non-cooperative games in\nwhich the existence of such a body is not possible. Yet, if it is to the benefit of all players,\nsince it is necessary for the favorable correlated equilibrium, wouldn't it be rational to\nsimply construct some sort of machine to perform this task? In other words, \"can the\ntrusted mediator be replaced by a protocol [or machine] that is run by the parties\nthemselves?\"[1] This machine would provide the presence of a mediator when one\ncouldn't be found. In this, it would provide assurance of a correlated equilibrium, or at\nthe very least, that some of the necessary steps towards one were being made.\n\n\u2020\n\nA proof of this can be found in [4].\n\n4\n\n\fOf course, such a protocol would need to satisfy certain requirements.\nChiefly, when given the appropriate input from Pi , the outcome it computes must yield\nthe same expected imputations as the human mediator. Additionally, all transactions\nbetween Pi and the device would need to be both private and secure; no other player could\ndiscover either the input of Pi , or the machine's strategy recommendation for this player,\nthis is a non-cooperative game after all.\nAn Iterative Turing machine, denoted \u03a0 , is the best candidate for this\nartificial mediator. It can be made to satisfy the first of these requirements (shown in the\nnext section), and through further modification, the Turing machine performs its duties\nsecurely. Additionally, one can be reassured that a correlated equilibrium can be\ncalculated in a practical amount of time. This is because it has been calculated that such a\nmachine can compute a correlated equilibrium for a game in polynomial time.\u2021\n\nV. A Non-Cooperative Game with Artificial Mediator\nTo examine the soundness of this artificial mediator, and the ability of the\nplayers to implement such a protocol, a non-cooperative game with such a referee is\nconsidered. It should be noted that because this analysis is the realm of cryptography, the\ngame consists of certain more cryptographic conventions, which an entirely game\ntheoretic model would never employ. Let this game be represented by \u0398. Each of the n\nplayers is first given a security parameter, k. The game itself occurs in two stages, much\nlike a game with a human mediator, \u03a8. To begin, there is the \"cheap talk\" phase. Here,\nthe parties run the protocol \u03a0, which computes the outcome b = (r1* ,..., rn* ). Next,\n\u03a0 privately and securely gives Pi the strategy recommendation ri* . Note that any party\nmay choose to abort the game during this stage; they may refuse to provide input to the\ncalculating machine.\nThe second phase of the game simply consists of each player selecting and\nutilizing an element of their strategy set, not necessarily their recommendation. If it is\nrational for all parties to use these recommended strategies, then a correlated equilibrium\nat b ensues. As is mentioned by Katz, \"It is not hard to see that the strategy vector thus\nspecified [b]...[yields] expected payoffs identical to those in the original mediated game\n[the correlated equilibrium vector a in \u03a8 ]. \"[1] Yet, a very large assumption is made\nin \u0398, an assumption which is unacceptable in any rigorous cryptographic analysis.\nNamely, it was assumed that the mediator protocol was secure and completely fair. In this\nsense, fair refers to the receipt of a strategy recommendation by all players which\nprovided input to the machine. That is, all transactions between a given party and the\nprotocol are successful. But, both security and fairness could very easily not be the case\nfor the protocol in \u0398. For instance, consider a cryptanalyst (possibly a player or a body\nunder the employ of a player) who constructs a block in the communication channel\n\n\u2021\n\nInterestingly enough, Nash equilibria correspond to the complexity class, NP, on this machine; they are\nbelieved to require quasi-superpolynomial time.\n\n5\n\n\fbetween a given player(s) and the machine. Furthermore, suppose this block functions to\nprevent the player(s) receiving a strategy recommendation.\u00a7 Denote such a game by \u0398 \u2032.\nDespite these adverse conditions, Dodi, Halevi, and Rabin, have\ndemonstrated that the outcome of \u0398 \u2032 is still a correlated equilibrium, at least in the\nfollowing special case. Let \u0398\u2032 consist of two players, and assume that P2 receives no\noutput from \u03a0.. Then, as they prove,** there is a correlated equilibrium at which P1\nplays r1* and P2 utilizes the minimax profile, m1\u2032\u2032 against P1 . The minimax profile against the\nith player is the action m\u2212i \u2208 S \u2212i such that max r * {u i (ri* , m \u2212i )} is minimized. That is, the\ni\n\nminimax profile is an element of the strategy set of all other players, where \" Pi [is given]\nits lowest possible utility, assuming Pi plays a best response [calculated by the protocol]\nto the strategy of the other parties.\"[1] This solution however does not generalize well\ninto games with more than two players. Thus it cannot be used as a basis for the claim\nthat a correlated equilibrium exists despite a game not being fair. In point of fact, this\nsolution is the closest to proving this generalization, despite the fact that it only functions\nin the aforementioned special case.\nVI. Conclusion\nA good deal can be concluded about the feasibility of a mediator protocol\ncreated by the players, despite the fact that no one is certain as to whether or not\ncorrelated equilibria exist in an unfair artificially mediated game. Were they to exist, then\nthe player created protocol would be quite advantageous and therefore feasible.\nRegardless of its fairness, correlated equilibria would occur, and the players would enjoy\nthe corresponding advantages: greater payoffs, etc. Alternatively, if these solutions did\nnot exist, apart from the special case mentioned above, there would still be impetus\nenough to create this protocol. However, the players involved in its creation would need\nto be quite cautious when approaching the fairness aspect, so as to achieve correlated\nequilibria. For instance, the players might consider dividing up the task of securing the\nprotocol among themselves such that no one player knows enough about the scheme to\ncreate unfairness. Additionally, the channels connecting the parties to the machine would\nmost likely need to involve a cryptographic system(s) widely regarded as impenetrable.\nThese measures are equally necessary for the case in which correlated equilibria exist in\nsome instances, and not others. That is, they are needed to guarantee equilibrium among\nthe players. In brief, because this protocol is very capable of producing advantageous\nresults, it is always feasible. Although, it is important to note that more effort may be\nrequired on the part of the players, depending on the existence of correlated equilibria in\nthe general case.\n\n\u00a7\n\nEven though it is deemed unfair, the protocol is still considered secure. An insecure protocol would imply\nthat a third party could capture and decipher the transmissions between a player(s) and the machine. This is\nnot necessarily the case when a machine is unfair.\n**\nThis is established at length in [1] and [3].\n\n6\n\n\fWorks Cited\n1.
