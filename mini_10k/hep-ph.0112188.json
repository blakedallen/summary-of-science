The authors developed a model of unstable\nparticles and found that their Boltzmann equations generate a non-exponentially-suppressed\nequilibrium distribution function for heavy particles at low temperatures. This deviation from\nthe standard picture was due to cut contributions far from the quasi-particle pole. These works\nwere later criticized by several authors [2, 3, 4], their main point being that the definition\nof particle number is delicate for unstable particles. Redefining particle number may change\nthe coefficient of the non-exponential term [3], or completely cancel it [2]. In [4] the authors\nargued that the naive definition needs renormalization in perturbation theory and proposed a\nnon-perturbative definition for the number density.\nNon-quasi-particle properties of the quantum fields may change also the time evolution of\nthe physical observables, as was also emphasized in [1]. The same phenomenon was found also\nin the time evolution of bosonic condensates [5, 6]. In these latter cases power-law decay was\nshown up even in the linear response theory.\nIn this paper we use linear response perturbation theory to investigate the long-time behavior of composite operators. As a specific example we consider the \"quasi-conserved\" charge of a\nscalar field. In this way we cannot address the equilibrium state; still, it is a physical scheme at\nwhich practically all systems must arrive after long time evolution. The numerical advantage\nis that all expectation values are defined in equilibrium, so that they can, in principle, be calculated without additional approximation. It is very important that the different contributions\nare additive, which makes it possible to identify different physical effects without entangling\nthem.\nIn fact there is a close analogy in the formalism describing the time evolution of the field\ncondensates [5, 6] and the scalar charge operators; the details will be explained in the paper. In\nlinear response theory the field condensates are proportional to the retarded Green's function;\nin the case of the charge Q we have instead QF retarded Green's function (with arbitrary F ).\nThe discontinuity of the retarded propagator for free case is a delta function concentrated on\nthe mass shell. In the free theory Q is conserved, thus the discontinuity of QF retarded Green's\nfunction is \u223c \u03b4(k0 ) \u2013 this is the \"mass shell\" of the QF spectral function. In the interacting\ncase, at small coupling, the mass shell still represents quasi-particles. In a similar way the\ncharge, although not conserved, characterizes the system well. In analogy to quasi-particles we\ncall it quasi-conserved charge.\nThe shift of the mass shell is not a perturbative effect. Indeed, when we calculate the propagator in perturbation theory we find IR divergences on the mass shell. One uses Schwinger\u2013\nDyson equations to resum these divergences, and a Breit\u2013Wigner approximation to describe\nthe shift of the mass shell. The same phenomenon appears also in the QF propagator: the\nshift of the \"mass shell\" causes IR divergences in perturbation theory at k0 = 0. In coordinate space these divergences are manifested as secular terms. These, as was shown by [7], can\nbe resummed to quantum Boltzmann equations. In momentum space the same phenomenon\nshows up as pinch singularities [8, 9, 10, 11]. In order to resum them we have to consider ladder\ndiagrams [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], which we will show to result in Kadanoff\u2013Baym equations. These\nare, at lowest order [17], the usual Boltzmann equations. Thus the analogy of the Schwinger\u2013\n1\n\n\fDyson resummation in Breit\u2013Wigner approximation is the use of Boltzmann equations in the\ncomposite operator case.\nThe analogy, however, extends even more. In the propagator we find, apart from the\nbroadened mass shell, other structures as well. Most important are the analytic defects (e.g.\nmultiparticle cuts), which play an important role in the long-time evolution, as they give powerlaw decay [1, 5, 6]. These are not related to the broadening, and they are perturbative in the\nmassive case. We find similar defects in the QF propagator, giving power-law decay at large\ntimes, which are independent of the Boltzmann equations.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we work out how initial conditions can\nbe taken into account in linear response theory and what kind of long-time behavior can be\nexpected. It has two ingredients: a pole contribution, which yields exponential damping, and\na power-law correction coming from other analytic defects (such as cuts). In Section 3 the first\ncontribution is considered and it is shown that this comes from the quantum Boltzmann equations (Kadanoff\u2013Baym equations). In Section 4 the off-shell analytic defects are investigated.\nMultiparticle cuts give a power-law, oscillating time dependence. It is shown, however, that\nthey can be combined even at the linear response level giving non-oscillating time dependence.\nIn Section 5 we summarize our findings.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nLong-time behavior in linear response theory\nThe model\n\nInspired by the discussion about the particle number, we choose a well-measurable observable:\nthe charge of a bosonic field (cf. [2]). The Lagrangian\n1\nL = \u2212\u03a8\u2020 (\u2202 2 + m2\u03a8 )\u03a8 \u2212 \u03c7\u2020 (\u2202 2 + m2\u03c7 )\u03c7 \u2212 \u03a6(\u2202 2 + m2\u03a6 )\u03a6 \u2212 h\u03a6(\u03a8\u2020 \u03c7 + \u03c7\u2020 \u03a8)\n2\n\n(1)\n\ncontains a heavy charged \u03a8 particle (with mass m\u03a8 ) and a light charged \u03c7 particle (with mass\nm\u03c7 ) coupled through a Yukawa term with a scalar \u03a6 (with mass m\u03a6 ).\nWithout the Yukawa term, the U(1) phase symmetry would be perfect, and the currents\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nJ\u03bc\u03a8 = \u03a8\u2020 i \u2202 \u03a8 and J\u03bc\u03c7 = \u03c7\u2020 i \u2202 \u03c7\n\n(2)\n\nwould be conserved quantities. For h 6= 0 they are not conserved\n\u2202J \u03a8 = ih\u03a6(\u03c7\u2020 \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8\u2020 \u03c7),\n\n\u2202J \u03c7 = ih\u03a6(\u03a8\u2020 \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u2020 \u03a8),\n\n(3)\n\nonly their sum is. Our final goal is to describe the time evolution of the charge of \u03a8 and \u03c7\nD\n\nE\n\nQ\u03a8 (t) = Q\u0302\u03a8 (t) = Tr \u03c1\u0302Q\u03a8 (t),\n\nQ\u0302\u03a8 (t) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x J0\u03a8 (x, t),\n\n(4)\n\nand similarly for \u03c7, where \u03c1\u0302 is the initial density matrix. In order to avoid complications with\nthe chemical potential, we assume that the total charge is zero.\n\n2\n\n\f2.2\n\nLinear response theory\n\nTracing the time evolution, starting from a non-equilibrium density matrix, is usually a hard\ntask [18]. Here we follow a way where we construct the initial state from equilibrium by acting\non the system with a time-dependent external force \u2013 after all this is the way one acts in a real\nexperiment. At t = \u2212\u221e we start from equilibrium, then we prepare the initial conditions by\nchanging H \u2192 H + Hext(t) for times \u2212\u221e < t < 0, finally we turn off the external force and\nstart to measure for 0 < t < \u221e.\nThis picture can be formulated in path integral representation, since at t = \u2212\u221e we have\nequilibrium ensemble. For an observable O(x)\n1\nhO(x)i =\nZ\n\nZ\n\nO(x) eiS\u2212i\n\nKM S\n\nR\n\nc\n\n\u03b6F\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere KM S denotes path integration where the paths are subject to KMS conditions along the\napplied Keldysh contour c. The external force is F and its explicitly time-dependent amplitude\nis denoted by \u03b6(t) (here t is the real time, not the contour time variable).\nBy the end of a realistic time evolution, we deviate only slightly from equilibrium; therefore\nwe expect that the corresponding state can be produced using a weak force. That means that\nin this case we can use linear response theory. If in equilibrium hOieq = 0 then we have\nR\n\nhO(x)i = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\u2032 \u0398(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) h[O(x), F (x\u2032)]ieq \u03b6(x\u2032).\n\n(6)\n\nHere the expectation value of the commutator has to be taken in equilibrium, and therefore it\nis a function of x \u2212 x\u2032 . We denote\n(OF )\n\niGR\n\n(x) = \u0398(t) h[O(x), F (0)]ieq ,\n(OF )\n\nnote that in Fourier space \u033a(OF ) (k) = i Disc GR\nFor our concrete observable,\n\nk0\n\n\u033a(OF ) (x) = h[O(x), F (0)]ieq ;\n\n(7)\n\n(k).\n\n(J F )\n\nQ(k0 ) = hJ0 (k0 , k = 0)i = GR 0 (k)\u03b6(k)|k=0 .\n\n(8)\n\nThis is very similar, in spirit, to the usual Kubo formulae [19], the only difference being that\nnow the external force is not fixed. In principle we can imagine a lot of possible choices (e.g. a\nplausible one F \u223c HI where HI is the interaction Hamiltonian); what is only important is that\nit should create a net Q(0), i.e. [Q\u0302, F ] 6= 0.\nHaving the formal result in hand, there is still a question of how to characterize the process\nand how to compute the specific numbers. In general we expect that, close to t = 0 when the\nexternal force was switched off, the time evolution contains a lot of transients. This is reflected\nalso in the fact that Q(t) depends strongly on the choice of F . Only after a long time do we\nexpect that the time dependence is independent of the initial conditions. Concentrating on this\nregion we now examine the long-time behavior of an expression like (8).\n\n3\n\n\f2.3\n\nLong-time behavior: the general case\n\nThis analysis follows closely the one of Refs. [5, 6], including also the \u03b6 dependence. We examine\nthe long-time behavior of\nZ\ndk0 \u2212ik0 t\ne\nGR (k0 )\u03b6(k0),\n(9)\nf (t) =\n2\u03c0\nwhere GR is a general retarded Green's function, \u03b6 is the amplitude of the external force. We\nassume that the analytic defects of \u03b6(k0) are on the upper half-plane and the ones of GR are\nalong the real axis. Then, taking into account that using retarded Green's functions means\nthat we have to use a contour that runs slightly above the real axis in k0 , we can extend\nthe integration region for t > 0 as is shown in Fig. 1a (the semi-circle at infinity gives zero\ncontribution).

Since for \u03b6 the threshold a is not a special point we expect that it starts\n4\n\n\fwith a constant. On the other hand \u033a usually starts with Ry \u03b1, where R is a constant and\n\u03b1 6= 0. The omitted terms are at least one power of y larger than the leading ones.

Constraints can\nbe formulated in the form of sum rules, as for example\ndk0\n\u033a(k0 )\u03b6(k0),\n(15)\n2\u03c0i\nbut it gives information on the integral properties, and not for single values which appear in\n(14). So, practically, the relative weights of the different parts in the long-time expression (14)\nare arbitrary.\nThis behaviour is, in fact, well known if we have a finite number of poles only,\nQ(t = 0) =\n\nf (t) =\n\nZ\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nci e\u2212i\u03c9i t ,\n\n(16)\n\ni=0\n\nwhich can be the result of an Nth order ordinary linear differential equation with constant\ncoefficients. The smallest Im \u03c9i will be dominant for long times, the other frequencies represent\na transient behaviour. The coefficients ci are free parameters coming from the initial conditions.\nFor a finite number of poles, sum rules of the form\nf (n) (t = 0) =\n\nX\n\nci (\u2212i\u03c9i )n ,\n\nn = 0...N \u2212 1\n\n(17)\n\n(the superscript (n) stands for the nth derivative) can fully determine the coefficients \u2013 ie. the\nknowledge of N derivatives at the initial time is needed. In case of continuous spectral functions,\nhowever, detailed knowledge of the history is necessary for their complete determination.\nWe can also find the analogue of the power law behaviour for the finite case. If we consider\ntwo oscillators working at nearby frequencies \u03c9 \u00b1 \u2206, then\ncos(\u03c9 + \u2206)t + cos(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206)t = 2 cos \u03c9t cos \u2206t,\n\n(18)\n\nthe result is an average frequency oscillation modulated by a low frequency oscillation. In this\nway high frequency modes can have IR behaviour. When the number of the oscillators grows\nand at the same time the frequency difference vanishes we have\n\u22121\n1 NX\nei\u03c9t 1 \u2212 eict\nei(\u03c9+nc/N )t =\nN n=0\nN 1 \u2212 eict/N\n\n1\u226act\u226aN\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\niei\u03c9t\n,\nct\n\ni.e. we arrive indeed at a power-law decay. For N \u2192 \u221e this will be valid for all times.\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\f2.4\n\nLong-time behaviour for quasi-conserved quantities\n\nThe structure of \u033a is special for an observable that is conserved in some limit, and its breaking is\nweak. In our specific case in the h \u2192 0 limit Q is conserved, so we expect that for small Yukawa\ncouplings the following will be true. If there were no breaking at all then Q\u0307 = i[H, Q] = 0,\ntherefore\nD\nE\nD\nE\n\u033a(t, k = 0) = [Q\u0302(t), F (0)] = [Q\u0302(0), F (0)] = \u033a(0, k = 0).\n(20)\neq\n\neq\n\nIts Fourier transform therefore is \u033a(k0 ) \u223c \u03b4(k0 ), as can be seen in Fig. 2a. If Q is not conserved,\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\nk0\n\nk0\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nFigure 2: Schematic plot of the spectral function for a.) conserved quantity and b.) weak\nbreaking.\nwe expect, in general, that we have non-zero \u033a also for other values of k0 . Close to the conserved\nlimit, we shall recover something like Fig 2b. The delta peak at zero k0 will be broadened, but\nit still represents a pole near the origin. Moreover we expect to find some other structures\n(analytic defects) as well. From this spectral function, according to the previous subsection,\nwe have the time dependence for long times\ncos(\u03a9t + \u03c6)\n+ ...,\n(21)\nt\u03b1+1\nwhere \u0393 is the shift of the k = 0 pole, \u03a9 is the position of the threshold with the smallest \u03b1.\nThe coefficients Q1 , Q2 and \u03c6 depend on the initial conditions.\nOne could think that power-law terms dominate for really long times. This is true; still,\nthere are effects which make them less relevant. One is that usually \u03a9 \u223c m (a mass scale in the\nsystem), and so they are fast oscillating functions. Thus they can hardly influence physics on\nscales larger than m\u22121 . The \u03a9 \u223c 0 case is exceptional. This, however, shows up at higher order\nin perturbation theory (or comes from non-linear effects \u2013 see later) and Q2 is proportional to\nsome powers of the coupling constant h. Thus Q1 \u226b Q2 (unless we have very special initial\nconditions), and the first term will be larger for a large period of time. Analyzing the functions\nwe find that the two terms are equal at time t, where\nQ(t) = Q1 e\u2212\u0393t + Q2\n\n\u03c4 < \u0393t < 1.582\u03c4,\n\n\"\n\nQ1\n\u03c4 = ln\nQ2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1+1\n\u0393\n\n\u0013\u03b1+1 #\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nSince Q1 /Q2 and \u0393 are polynomials of h, the first term is the leading one up to times \u0393t \u223c\n\u2212C ln h, where C \u223c 5\u201310 typically (for example if Q2 /Q1 \u223c h2 , \u03b1 + 1 = 3 and \u0393 \u223c h2 then\n6\n\n\fC = 8). During this time the charge drops a factor of e\u2212\u0393t \u223c hC , i.e. for small couplings the\npower law regime may be unobservable. A hint for the presence of such a regime, however, can\nbe seen in numerical simulations [22].\nOn the other hand, if h is not small, then the exponential behaviour may be suppressed.\nIn fact, only in quasi-particle picture, when \u0393 \u226a other mass scales, do we expect exponential\ndamping.\n\n3\n\nThe damping rate\n\nIn the previous section we outlined the general long-time behaviour for a quasi-conserved quantity such as the particle charge. The two relevant effects found are broadening of the delta\npeak at k0 = 0, and analytic defects at k0 = 0. In this section we make some remarks on the\nbroadening effect.\nIn our specific example at h = 0 the charge is conserved, and we assume that for small h\nit still represents a pole on the second Riemann sheet close to the origin. For small k0 we thus\nexpect that the time-ordered or retarded propagator (at least the pole contribution to that)\ncan be approximated as\nD\n\nE\n\nG(QF ) (k0 ) = T Q\u0302 F (k0 ) \u2192\n\nC\n,\nk0 + i\u0393\n\nfor k0 \u2192 0, Im k0 < 0.\n\n(23)\n\nThis form suggests that the broadening effect must show up as IR divergences in the perturbation theory. Here, namely, we can calculate only h-power corrections to the leading result,\ntherefore the appearance of \u0393 in the denominator means that in perturbation theory we find\nG\n\n(QF )\n\n\u0013\n\u221e \u0012\n\u2212i\u0393 n\nC X\n.\n(k0 \u2192 0) \u2192\nk0 n=0 k0\n\n(24)\n\nThe signal of this behaviour is the \u223c 1/k0n divergence of the perturbative expression for small\n(but not zero!) k0 .\nWorking in coordinate space the k0\u2212n divergences turn into tn\u22121 time dependence. These are\nthe secular terms that appear in all orders in perturbation theory, and that can be resummed\naccording to [7] as the quantum Boltzmann equation.\nUsing perturbative methods in Fourier space, the origin of these IR divergences is the\npinch singularities [8, 9]. To see this consider a diagram contributing to the QF retarded\nGreen's function with a 2-particle intermediate state, as can be seen in Fig. 3. The momenta\nof the propagators G1 and G2 , because of energy\u2013momentum conservation, are q + k0 and q,\nrespectively. If these propagators are retarded and advanced with the same mass, then for\nk0 = 0 the poles of the two propagators approach the real axis from above and from below,\nthus \"pinching\" it, giving the divergent result GR (q)GA (q) \u223c (\u03b4(q 2 \u2212 m2 ))2 [8, 9]. For finite k0\nwe do not expect divergences, but the k0 \u2192 0 limit must be infinite. In Appendix A we indeed\nfind that, at the k0 \u2192 0 limit, we have a singular behaviour for the products\nGR\n\n!\n\nk\nk\nq+\nGA q \u2212\n2\n2\n\n!\n\nd(q)\n,\n\u2192 i\u033a(q)\n2q0 k0\n\nGR/A\n\n7\n\n!\n\nk\nk\nGrr q \u2212\nq+\n2\n2\n\n!\n\n\u2192\n\nd(q)\nGrr (q),\n2q0 k0\n(25)\n\n\f...\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n...\n\nk11\n00\n0\n\n000\n111\n000\n111\n111111\n000000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n000 G 111\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n1\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n000\n111\nG 2 111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n11\n00\n111\n000\n111111\n000000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nFigure 3: IR-divergent (ladder) diagram. The shaded insertions can represent rungs or selfenergy insertions.\n\nand the inclusion of GR (q + k/2) yields an extra d(q)/2q0 k0 factor, while the inclusion of\nadditional GA (q \u2212 k/2) yields \u2212d(q)/2q0 k0 . Therefore a ladder containing n rungs or selfenergy insertions may yield a k0\u2212n IR divergence, corresponding exactly to our expectations.\nWe can also argue that more particle intermediate states do not give pinch singularities\nin the massive case. Consider a 3-particle intermediate state with momenta p, q and \u2212p \u2212 q\n(k = 0 case). We expect an IR enhancement if the sum of two momenta is almost zero; let us\ntake q \u2248 p + q, i.e. p \u2248 0. Then the propagator with momentum p gives 1/m2 , where its mass\nis m, the other two propagators are replaced using Appendix A. One finds, concentrating on\nthis region,\n\u033a(q)\n1\n\u223c d4 p d4 q 2\n.\n(26)\n2\nm 2p0 q0 \u2212 \u03c9p+q\n+ \u03c9q2\nThis expression is IR-safe, as can be seen for example by integrating over the IR region |p0 |, |p| <\n\u03b5. Therefore we cannot have any 1/k0 enhancement from this insertion. This argumentation\ncan be extended to more internal lines.\nThere exists another possibility when there is an IR sub-divergence, coming from a selfenergy insertion on an internal line. Since, however, internal lines are equilibrium propagators,\nthese pathologies must finally cancel [8].\nTo resum the ladder diagrams we perform point splitting in a symmetric way:\nhJ\u03bc (x)i = y\u2192x\nlim (i\u2202\u03bcx \u2212 i\u2202\u03bcy )\n\nE\n1D\n\u03a8\n\u03a8(x)\u03a8\u2020 (y) + \u03a8\u2020 (y)\u03a8(x) = y\u2192x\nlim (i\u2202\u03bcx \u2212 i\u2202\u03bcy )iGrr\n(x, y),\n2\n\n(27)\n\nand similarly for \u03c7, where we used R/A formalism to define the propagator [23]. The G\npropagator corresponds to the boxed part in the diagram of Fig. 3.

Keeping only the pinch singular terms we can write\niG N +1 (p, p\u2032 ) = 1/2k0q0 (K \u2217 iG N )(p, p\u2032 ), where q = (p + p\u2032 )/2 and k = p \u2212 p\u2032 (cf. (25)). The sum\nP\nfor all ladders G = N G N then satisfies iG(p, p\u2032 ) = 1/2k0q0 (K \u2217 iG)(p, p\u2032 ). With the Wigner\ntransformed functions (29), this can be written as W(q, k) = 1/2k0q0 (K \u2217 W)(q, k), or, in real\nspace (performing a Fourier transformation with respect to k),\n2iq0 \u2202t W(q, t) = (K \u2217 W)(q, t),\n\n(31)\n\na first order differential equation.\nThis differential equation is unique up to leading order in the k expansion. Let us assume,\nnamely, that there is another equation\n2iq0 \u2202t W(q, t) = (K \u2032 \u2217 W)(q, t)\n\n(32)\n\nsatisfied by W. Then inserting the solution of (31) into this equation we find\n(K \u2212 K \u2032 ) \u2217 W = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nThis is an identity that must be fulfilled for K and K \u2032 . This shows that K = K \u2032 on the space\nof the solutions of (31).\nUsing this property we can use differential equations of the form of (31) with different\norigin in order to resum pinch singularities. And exactly of this form are the Kadanoff\u2013Baym\nequations [20] in linear response. For the free theory, namely, the propagators satisfy, because\nof the Schwinger\u2013Dyson equations,\n(\u2202x2 \u2212 \u2202y2 )G(x, y) = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\n2iq0 \u2202t W(q, t) = 0.\n\n(34)\n\nIn the case of interactions the right-hand side depends on G (or W), but in the linear response\ntheory it is linearized and has the form K \u2217 W with some kernel. We therefore recover (32).\nThe uniqueness of this equation then implies that the Kadanoff\u2013Baym equations represent an\nadequate tool to resum the pinch singularities of ladder diagrams in linear response theory.\nSo finally both the coordinate space method [7] and the momentum space method outlined\nabove support the statement that the resummation of 1/k0n IR singularities of the perturbation theory yields quantum Boltzmann equations (Kadanoff\u2013Baym equations). Therefore \u0393\nappearing in (23) must be calculated using Boltzmann equations.\nIn our model to lowest order we have to take into account the decay processes, which have\na matrix element h.

The possible values of q0 are q0 = \u00b1\u03c9q (the dispersion relation).\nWe solve the equations in the relaxation time approximation.

There are 4 such points in this case: k0 = \u00b1m1 \u00b1 m2 .\n(1)\n(2)\nWe restrict ourselves for positive k0 and denote k0 = m1 + m2 and k0 = m1 \u2212 m2 (assuming\nm1 \u2265 m2 ). At k (1) a cut starts, at k (2) it stops, so for the threshold behaviour we choose\n(1)\n(2)\nk0 = k0 + y or k0 = k0 \u2212 y. Since for y \u2192 0 the phase space vanishes (q \u2192 0), we can expand\neverything to second order with respect to |q|.\nIn the k (1) case the relevant combination of the delta functions of (44) is\n\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 )\u03b4(k0 \u2212 q0 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\n\u21d2\n\nk0 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 .\n\n(45)\n\n(1)\n\nExpanding \u03c91 + \u03c92 around k0 = m1 + m2 to second order yields\n1\n1\ny=\n+\nq2 ,\n2m1 2m2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(46)\n\nso that |q| vanishes as y 1/2 . Assuming that \u0393 does not vanish in this limit (as the best case),\nand we substitute \u03c91,2 \u2192 m1,2 , k0 = m1 + m2 and q = 0 where it is possible, we find\nC \u223c (1 + N(m1 ) + N(m2 ))\n\nZ\n\n1\n1\nd3 q\nq2 \u223c y 1/2 ,\n\u03b4\ny\n\u2212\n+\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2m1 2m2\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n(47)\n\nwhich can be seen after performing the integral. This is the same as the zero-temperature result\n[21], only the amplitude is modified by (1 + N(m1 ) + N(m2 )).\n11\n\n\fThe k (2) case goes along the same lines. We choose the combination\n\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 )\u03b4(k0 \u2212 q0 + \u03c92 )\n\n\u21d2\n\nk0 = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n1\n1\nq2 ,\n\u2212\ny=\n2m2 2m1\n\u0012\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u0013\n\n(48)\n\nand therefore\nC \u223c (N(m1 ) \u2212 N(m2 ))y 1/2 .\n\n(49)\n\nThis is a finite temperature effect, the threshold of the Landau cut [19].\nFor our concrete example described by the Lagrangian (1), only equal-mass two-particle\nintermediate states are allowed. In that case the first threshold is just a zero temperature one,\nstarting at 2mi where mi \u2208 {m, M, mS }. The second case, however, is not present, since the\ndelta constraints then give \u03b4(k0 ). So there the important cut contribution has \u03a9 = 2mi and\n\u03b1 = 1/2. That is we obtain an oscillating contribution which has presumably negligible effect\non real physical processes.\n\n4.2\n\nFour-particle intermediate state\n\nFour-particle intermediate states may contain cuts, and this will be analyzed in the next subsection. Here we concentrate on other possible analytic defects.\nOn the same footing as before we can write up the contribution coming from the four-particle\nintermediate state\nC4 (k) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 q1 d4 q4\nP\n..\n\u03b4(k \u2212 q)\u0393(k, {q}) [(1 + N1 )..(1 + N4 ) \u2212 N1 ..N4 ] \u033a1 (q1 )..\u033a4 (q4 ), (50)\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0) (2\u03c0)\n\nwhere Ni = N(q0i ). We change q \u2192 \u2212q in the first term and write C4 (k) = C4+ (k) \u2212 C4\u2212 (k)\nwhere\nZ 4\nd q1 d4 q4\nP\n\u00b1\n..\n\u03b4(k \u00b1 q)\u0393(k, {\u2213q})N1 ..N4 \u033a1 ..\u033a4 .\n(51)\nC4 (k) =\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0) (2\u03c0)\n\nIn fact, this is a general form; we can write also for the two-particle contribution (44) C2 (k) =\nC2+ (k) \u2212 C2\u2212 (k), where\nC2\u00b1 (k) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 q1 d4 q2\nP\n\u03b4(k\n\u00b1\nq)\u0393(k, {\u2213q})N1 N2 \u033a1 \u033a2 .\n(2\u03c0)4 (2\u03c0)4\n\n(52)\n\nWe now make a simplification, and assume that for some reason \u0393 is factorized as \u0393(k, {q}) =\n\u0393(1,2) (k, q1 , q2 )\u0393(3,4) (k, q3 , q4 ). This means a loss in generality; but we hope that the main\nconsequences still remain true. We introduce an auxiliary variable Q and write\nC4+ (k) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 Q Z d4 q1 d4 q2\n\u03b4(Q + q1 + q2 )\u0393(1,2) (k, \u2212q1 , \u2212q2 )N1 N2 \u033a1 (q1 )\u033a2 (q2 )\n(2\u03c0)4\n(2\u03c0)4 (2\u03c0)4\nZ 4\nd q3 d4 q4\n\u03b4(k \u2212 Q + q3 + q4 )\u0393(3,4) (k, \u2212q3 , \u2212q4 )N3 N4 \u033a3 (q3 )\u033a4 (q4 ).(53)\n\u00d7\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0) (2\u03c0)\n\nOn the right-hand side we recover the convolution of two C2+ contributions; in real time they\nare simply multiplied. The complete four-particle contribution can be written as\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nC4 (t) = C2+ (t)C2\u2032 (t) \u2212 C2\u2212 (t)C2\u2032 (t).\n12\n\n(54)\n\n\fAt zero temperature N(q0 ) \u2192 \u2212\u0398(\u2212q0 ), thus C2+ contains only the positive energy cuts and\n\u2032\nC2+ C \u2032 +\n2 oscillates with frequency \u03a9 + \u03a9 . At finite temperature, however, the negative energy\ncut appears as well, and, for the same threshold values, we have\nA\u2212 A\u2032+ + A+ A\u2032\u2212\nA\u2212 ei\u03a9t + A+ e\u2212i\u03a9t A\u2032\u2212 ei\u03a9t + A\u2032+ e\u2212i\u03a9t\n=\n+ oscillating.\nt3/2\nt3/2\nt3\n\n(55)\n\nDiagrammatically it comes from the diagram where two lines are incoming, two are outgoing,\nor vice versa. Kinematically, with the external line, it is a 2 \u2192 3 or 3 \u2192 2 process. Also from\nhere we see that this contribution must be absent at zero temperature. We can assess the\ntemperature dependence by the typical factor for 2 incoming and 2 outgoing internal lines,\n(1 + N(m1 ))(1 + N(m2 ))N(m3 )N(m4 ).\n\n(56)\n\nFor low temperatures the contribution is therefore Boltzmann-suppressed.\nWe can also have cancellations at finite temperature, if the + and \u2212 parts in (54) cancel\neach other. C + and C \u2212 are related as (writing out explicitly the dependence on the \u0393 vertex\nfunction)\nC + (\u0393, \u2212k) = C \u2212 (\u0393\u0303, k), where \u0393\u0303(k, {q}) = \u0393(\u2212k, {\u2212q}).\n(57)\nCancellation occurs, if \u0393\u0303 = \u00b1\u0393 for small k. For generic F at finite temperature we do not\nexpect such a symmetry, therefore a net effect will remain.\nHow can this phenomenon show up in a diagram? If we calculate Q(k0 ) for small k0 , we\nencounter ladder diagrams, as is shown in Fig. 3. The ending of the ladder (the triangle at the\nright-hand side) contributes to the numerator (the constant C in eq. (23)).

When computing the numerical coefficient of the k0 = 0 defect we substitute k0 = 0 in\nthe numerator, which means an enhancement factor of 1/\u0393.\nFour-particle initial conditions can also come from the quadratic response (as a product\nof two two-particle operators). Having the same effect, it is natural to assume that their\ncontribution is also in the same order of magnitude, i.e. \u03b64 \u223c \u03b622 . Since \u03b6 \u226a 1 (linear response\n13\n\n\fregime) we find suppression in this term2 . To have only one small parameter in the system we\nwill assume that \u03b62 \u223c h2 .\nSummarizing, the 1/t3 contribution of the four-particle intermediate state is suppressed by\nseveral effects compared to the Boltzmann pole. It has a perturbative suppression of h2 ; it is a\nfinite-temperature effect, so that it is Boltzmann-suppressed at small temperatures; it has two\ncontributions with opposite sign; and finally it is a multiloop effect, which probably means also\na numerical suppression.\n\n4.3\n\nMultiparticle cuts and other defects\n\nThe determination of the threshold behaviour described in the case of two-particle intermediate\nstates can be generalized to multiparticle intermediate states (cf. Fig. 4b). We expect thresholds\nwhen the external k0 plus the N internal particles represent a decay process (1 \u2192 N or N \u2192 1),\nsince scattering processes do not have cuts. There always exists a possibility, when all of the\nP\n(1)\ninternal particles are outgoing, so that k0 = i mi is the threshold value; this is also the\nzero-temperature case. At finite temperature an additional threshold is possible (for positive\nk0 ), when one particle is outgoing, the rest are incoming. Then we obtain a threshold at\nP\n(2)\nk0 = m1 \u2212 N\ni=2 mi , if it is positive.\nNear the threshold, in the massive case, we can perform the same expansion as in (46), and\nP\nalso there is a momentum-conserving delta function \u03b4( qi ). Therefore what remains is\nZ\n\n3\n\n3\n\nd q1 . . . d qN \u03b4 y \u2212\n\nX\ni\n\nX\n3(N\u22121)\n3\n3N\nq2i\nqi \u223c y 2 y \u22121y \u2212 2 \u223c y 2 \u22121 .\n\u03b4\n2mi\ni\n!\n\n!\n\n(59)\n\nThe possible values for \u03a9 thus are i mi and m1 \u2212 i>1 mi (if it is positive), in both cases\n\u03b1 = 3(N2\u22121) \u2212 1 (which is also the zero-temperature result).\nSimilarly to the two times two-particle cut case, multiparticle cuts can also be multiplied\nin real space to generate new defects. This means, however, a faster decay than 1/t3 .\nP\n\n5\n\nP\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we tried to describe the time evolution of the charge operator Q in a complex\nscalar system, starting from an initial state not too far from thermal equilibrium. The initial\nstate was prepared using an external action that modifies the time evolution for a given period.\nWe applied linear response theory in the external action to describe time evolution. As a\ncomputing method we used real time perturbation theory.\nThe long-time behaviour of Q is determined by the QF spectral function in the linear\nresponse theory, where F is an arbitrary operator ([Q, F ] 6= 0). If Q were conserved, there\nwould be \u033a(QF ) (k0 ) \u223c \u03b4(k0 ). For the non-conserving case two types of contributions can be\nidentified (cf. [1, 5, 6]). One is coming from the broadening of the \u03b4(k0 ) pole of the conserved\nQ-case, yielding exponential damping for long times. In perturbation theory it manifests itself\n2\n\nThis hierarchy, however, does not necessarily hold: wild initial conditions can violate it, then the 1/t3 time\ndependence also has a coefficient of O(1).\n\n14\n\n\fas pinch singularities in the ladder diagrams, giving 1/k0n type of IR divergences at any order\nin the coupling. Resummation of these singularities results in linearized Kadanoff\u2013Baym equations. Working in real space, 1/k0n singularities correspond to the secular terms tn\u22121 , and their\nresummation also leads to quantum Boltzmann equations [7].\nAnalytic defects in \u033a(QF ) (k0 ) also contribute to long-time physics: it gives an e\u2212i\u03a9t /t\u03b1+1\noscillating power-law decay, where \u03a9 is the position of the defect, \u03b1 is the index of \u033a near to\nP\nP\nthe defect. For multiparticle cuts we have \u03a9 = i mi or mi \u2212 i>1 mi (if it is positive: a\nmultiparticle Landau damping), and index \u03b1 = 3(N \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 1, where N is the number of\nintermediate particles and mi are their masses. These contributions are oscillating with the\nparticle mass, so that they can hardly influence physics on IR scales. At finite temperature,\nhowever, these cuts can be combined, and from their superposition the oscillating behaviour\ncan drop out. The lowest order diagram giving this result contains 4 intermediate particles and\nyields 1/t3 type of decay.\nSo finally, starting from a generic initial state characterized by F , we expect that the time\nevolution of the charge for large times follows\nQ(t) = Q1 e\u2212\u0393t +\n\nQ2\n+ oscillating.\nt3\n\n(60)\n\nThe relative weights of the Boltzmann pole and the cut contributions contain free parameters,\ndepending on the initial state, and they contain perturbative factors. The pole is present\nalready at the free level, we thus expect Q1 = O(1) + perturbative corrections. The amplitude\nof Q2 is reduced by several effects; for example it is suppressed by h2 and by the Boltzmann\nfactor for small temperatures. Thus, for a generic situation we expect that exponential damping\ndominates the time evolution for intermediate times and only after a long time will the power\nlaw take over (for a numerical simulation example see, [22]). Still, because of its slow decay, it\ncan be relevant in the explanation of small deviations from equilibrium (such as baryogenesis).\nThis should be examined in the future.\nAnother task for the future is to include non-linear effects and see how the full Boltzmann\nequation gets modified due to the presence of cut contributions.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author would like to thank to M.

They have poles at \u00b1\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03b5 for the retarded Green's\nfunction and \u00b1\u03c9 + i\u03b5 for the advanced one. Their product thus has poles at \u00b1\u03c9 \u00b1 i\u03b5, which\npinch the real axis for \u03b5 \u2192 0, resulting in double poles which cannot be regularized. We do not\nexpect such problems for products like DR DR or DA DA .\nIn our case the momenta of the retarded and advanced propagators are offset by k. For\nfinite k we do not expect singularities, but the k \u2192 0 limit must be divergent.\nFirst we examine the DR (q + k)DA (q) product for small k = (k0 , 0). We will use the identity\n1\n1\n\u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(x)\n=P\nx + i\u03b5\nx\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(62)\n\nwhere P means principal value, so that\n\"\n\n1\nDR/A (q) =\nP\n2\u03c9\n\n1\nq0 \u2212 \u03c9\n\n!\n\n#\n\n\u2213 i\u03c0\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c9) \u2212 {\u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9} .\n\n(63)\n\nFor the product we obtain\nk\nk\n1\n1\nDR (q + )DA (q \u2212 ) =\ni\u03c0 P\n2\n2\n2\n4\u03c9\nk0\n\u0012\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\nk0\nk0\n\u03b4(q0 \u2212\n\u2212 \u03c9) + \u03b4(q0 +\n\u2212 \u03c9)\n2\n2\n\n!\n\n\u0015\n\n2\n\n+\u03c0 \u03b4(k0 )\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c9) + {\u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9} + non-singular,\n\n(64)\n\nthe non-singular terms having finite limit at k \u2192 0. Rewriting this expression we obtain\nk\nk\nDR (q + )DA (q \u2212 ) = i P\n2\n2\n\n!\n\n1\n1\n\u033a(q) + o\n,\n2q0 k0\nk0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(65)\n\nwhere \u033a is the free spectral function; o(1/x) means that limx\u21920 (x o(1/x)) = 0, which is trivial\nfor non-singular terms, and true for the delta term since x\u03b4(x) = 0.\nIn a real model we can write for the propagator G(q) = d(q)D(q), where d is the Klein\u2013\nGordon divisor3 [8].\nWe can obtain (65) in a different way, using i(GR \u2212GA ) = \u033a and that GR GR is non-singular.\nWe write\nk\nk\nk\nk\n(66)\nGR (q + )GA (q \u2212 ) = GR (q + ) i\u033a(q \u2212 ) \u2212 GR (q + k)GR (q).\n2\n2\n2\n2\nThe second term is finite for k \u2192 0, while in the first term at k = 0 we put a propagator on\nmass shell, which is clearly divergent. The numerator of GR (q + k/2) for small k reads\nq02\n\nk02\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 \u03c9q+k/2\n\u2192 2q0 k0 + \u03c9q\u2212k/2\n\u2212 \u03c9q+k/2\n\u2192 2q0 k0 \u2212 2k * \u2202\u03c9,\n+ q0 k0 +\n4\n\n(67)\n\nwhere we have power-expanded \u03c9q\u00b1k/2 . Therefore\nk\nk\nd(q)\nGR (q + )GA (q \u2212 ) =\ni\u033a(q) + . . . ,\n2\n2\n2q0 k0 \u2212 2k * \u2202\u03c9\n3\n\nFor fields with multiple mass shell we obtain a sum of these terms.\n\n16\n\n(68)\n\n\fwhere d(q) is the Klein\u2013Gordon divisor. It is also clear that any other GR factor yields the\nsame d(q)/(2q0k0 \u2212 2k * \u2202\u03c9) contribution. Additional GA factors yield \u2212d(q)/(2q0 k0 \u2212 2k * \u2202\u03c9)\ncontribution, as can be seen by using the above formulae for GR = \u2212i\u033a + GA .\nIn the paper we use k = (k0 , 0) momentum, but all the formulae can easily be generalized\nto finite k simply by 2q0 k0 \u2192 2q0 k0 \u2212 2k * \u2202\u03c9.\nPinch singularities occur in other products as well. In the R/A formalism [23] the propagators are GR , GA and Grr = (G12 + G21 )/2. Since Grr \u223c \u033a also puts the propagation on the\nmass shell, we find\nk\nd(q)\nk\nGrr (q).\n(69)\nGR/A (q + )Grr (q \u2212 ) =\n2\n2\n2q0 k0\nOn the other hand Grr (q + k) * Grr (q) \u223c \u03b4(k0 ), therefore it yields an o(1/k0 ) contribution. So in\nthe two-particle intermediate states the possible pinch enhancements are coming from GR GA\nand Grr GR/A only.\n\nReferences\n[1] I. Joichi, Sh. Matsumoto and M. Yoshimura, Phys. Rev.
