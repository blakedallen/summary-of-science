In its simplest version,\nreduced to a model with only one parameter, i.e. the\ncontribution of baryons to the critical density, \u03a9b h2 \u2248\n0.0224 [1], standard BBN predicted and observationally\ninferred primordial light element abundances are very\nclose. This holds particularly true for 2 H, and with somewhat less confidence also for 4 He. However, when the\nA > 4 elements are considered agreement is less convincing. The observationally inferred 7 Li/H ratio is about\na factor three smaller than that predicted in SBBN [2].\nMoreover, 6 Li which is known to only be synthesized at\nthe level 6 Li/H \u223c 10\u221215 \u2212 10\u221214 during SBBN has been\nrecently observed in about a dozen metal-poor halo stars\nwith abundance 6 Li/H \u223c 3\u22125\u00d710\u221212 [3, 4]. It is tantalizing that these observations indicate a plateau-structure,\nsimiliar to that observed in 7 Li, i.e. 6 Li abundance independent of metallicity of the star, for stars at the lowest\nmetallicities. A 6 Li plateau, should point to a pregalactic or primordial origin of this isotope, since the 6 Li had\nalready been in place before stars produced metallicity\n(and cosmic rays). However, it is cautioned that fairly\nuncertain stellar pre-main-sequence (PMS) destruction\nof 6 Li could contrive to give an apparent plateau [5].\n7\nLi (as well as 6 Li) are observed in the atmospheres of\nmetal-poor halo stars. When transported to the hotter\ninterior of the star, by either convection or turbulence,\nboth isotopes may be destroyed. It is thus possible that\natmospheric 7 Li has been depleted by some factor though\nstandard stellar models do not forsee this. A number of\ngroups have recently re-studied this possibility [6, 7, 8].\nPostulating stellar turbulence with a parametrised magnitude, but of unknown origin, Korn et al [8] claim that a\nstar-to-star homogeneous factor 1.95 depletion is possible\nand even favorable when observations of the metal-poor\n\nglobular cluster NGC6397 are considered. If true, the\nremaining factor \u223c 1.5 could be either due to systematic\nerrors in the effective stellar temperature calibration or\ndue to an overestimate of the SBBN predicted 7 Li abundance due to systematic errors in nuclear reaction data.\nConcerning the second possibility, a recent remeasurement of the key 7 Li producing reaction (3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be)\nseems to rather indicate a slight underestimate of the\nsynthesized 7 Li [9].\n6\n\nLi is known to be produced by spallation (p +\nCNO \u2192 LiBeB) and fusion (\u03b1 + \u03b1 \u2192 Li) reactions by\nstandard cosmic ray primaries scattering off nucleons and\nnuclei in the intergalactic medium [10]. Though this process may explain the observed 6 Li at solar metallicity, it is\nclear, however, that it falls short by a large factor (\u223c 50)\nto explain the 6 Li observed at low metallicity. Similiar\nholds true for putative cosmic ray populations due to\nshocks developed during structure formation [11]. In order to produce 6 Li/H\u223c 5\u00d710\u221212 an early cosmic ray population of \u223c 100eV/nucleon is required [12]. Most candidate sources fall short of this. The few viable remaining\nsources are due to accretion on the central Galactic black\nhole, albeit with an efficiency a factor 104 larger than\nthat presently observed, or due to a significant fraction\n\u223c 0.1 of all baryons forming supermassive stars (and cosmic rays) [12]. It may also be that our galaxy was host\nto a radio-loud quasar some time ago [13]. The energetic problem becomes even exaggerated when likely 6 Li\ndestruction during the stellar PMS [5] and putative 6 Li\ndestruction during the stellar main-sequence phases are\nconsidered, possibly solving the 7 Li discrepancy. Finally,\nit has also been suggested that the 6 Li may result in situ\nfrom production by solar flares within the first billion\nof years of the star's life [14]. Though this seems possible, it is hard to evaluate if a sufficient fraction of the\nfreshly synthesized 6 Li falls back into the stellar atmosphere rather than being expelled by the solar wind.\n\n\f2\nIt is entirely possible that the 7 Li and 6 Li anomalies\nare signs of physics beyond the standard model possibly connected to the quest for the cosmic dark matter.\nEven very small non-thermal perturbations in the early\nUniverse may lead to a significant and observable 6 Li\nabundance, without overly perturbing other light elements. It had thus been suggested that an anomalous\nhigh 6 Li abundance is due to non-thermal nuclear reactions (i.e. 3 H (\u03b1, n)6 Li , ...) induced by the late-time\n7\nt>\n\u223c 10 s electromagnetic [15, 16] or hadronic [17] decay of\na relic particle, as for example the gravitino. 6 Li in abundance as observed in old stars may also be synthesized\ndue to residual dark matter annihilations during the BBN\nepoch [18]. In particular, a standard thermal freeze-out\nprocess of weak scale particle dark matter (such as supersymmetric neutralinos) is concommitant with the production of 6 Li in the right amount, given the dark matter\n<\nmass falls in the range 20 <\n\u223c m\u03c7 \u223c 90 GeV, and annihilation is to a significant fraction hadronic and s-wave.\nConcerning a solution to the 7 Li problem, early attempts\nutilising the electromagnetic decay of a relic and the induced 7 Be photodisintegration [19] (7 Li is mostly synthesized as 7 Be, which later on electron-captures) have\nnot proven viable due to unacceptable perturbations in\nthe 2 H/H and 3 He/2 H ratios [20]. However, it has been\nshown that the hadronic decay of a relic during BBN,\nand the induced excessive neutron abundance may prematurely convert 7 Be to 7 Li which is then destroyed by\nproton capture. When \u03a9\u03c7 Bh \u223c 1 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u22124, where Bh is\nthe hadronic branching ratio, a factor 2 \u2212 4 destruction\nof 7 Li results [21]. For relic decay times \u2248 1000 s, it is\nmoreover possible to synthesize all the observed 6 Li by\nnon-thermal nuclear fusion. This has been the first, and\nso far only, known simultaneous solution to the 6 Li and\n7\nLi problems. It is noted that such a decay also leads to\na possibly problematic 30% - 50% increase in the synthesized 2 H/1 H ratio.\nWithin the context of minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics, a simultaneous solution is nicely realised, either by heavy gravitino decay, or in the case that gravitinos are the lightest\nsupersymmetric particles (LSPs) by the supersymmetric\npartner of the tau-lepton (the stau) decaying into gravitinos [21]. In the second scenario, an added benefit is\nthat for the right parameters to solve the 6 Li and 7 Li\nproblems, TeV staus left over from a thermal freeze-out\nat higher temperature,and decaying at \u03c4x \u2248 1000 s into\n50\u2212100 GeV gravitinos produce naturally about the right\namount of gravitinos to explain the dark matter and of\na warmness interesting to the formation of large scale\nstructure formation [22]. Unfortunately, staus of mass\n1 TeV are too heavy to be discovered at the LHC.\nRecently, it has been realised that the existence of electrically charged massive particles (CHAMPs) during the\nBBN epoch may lead to modifications of the synthesis\nof light elements [23, 24, 25] beyond those simply due to\ntheir decay. Since for gravitino LSPs, the next-to-LSP\n(NLSP) is long-lived and in about half of the supersym-\n\nmetric parameter space it is the electrically charged stau,\nsuch effects are important to consider. Other metastable\ncharged relic particles possibly existing during BBN have\nbeen also proposed [26]. Modifications to BBN occur due\nto the formation of electrically bound states between the\nnegatively charged CHAMPs and the positively charged\nnuclei. The realization that (meta)-stable weak-scale\nmass charged particles enter into bound states during\nand after BBN had already been made in the late eighties [27, 28, 29], when the possibility of charged dark matter was analyzed. Nevertheless, the influence of bound\nstates on BBN had not been much discussed.\nIn this paper results of the up-to-now most detailed\ncalculations of BBN nucleosynthesis in the presence of\ndecaying negatively charged particles are presented. The\nanalysis attempts to reveal all key processes important\nfor a reliable prediction of light element yields, thereby\nrevealing, heretofore neglected effects, which make orders\nof magnitude changes in the predicted BBN yields for\nmuch of the parameter space. These changes are found\n6\nmostly for late decaying \u03c4x >\n\u223c 10 s CHAMPs. The aim\nof the paper is to analyze the potential of bound-state\nnucleosynthesis to solve the cosmic 7 Li and 6 Li problems.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2\na discussion/analysis of all priorly suggested solutions\nto the 7 Li problem within bound-state nucleosynthesis\nis presented, whereas in Section 3 details of the present\ncalculations are given. In Section 4 it is shown that BBN\ncontinues to very low temperatures T \u226a 1 keV in the\npresence of bound states. Section 5 shows that bound\nstates are efficiently photodisintegrated already at high\ntemperature due to the decay of the relic. Section 6\nstresses the importance of CHAMP transfer reactions at\nlate times. Finally In Section 7 possible further solutions\nto the 6 Li and 7 Li problems for late-decaying CHAMPs\n6\n\u03c4x >\n\u223c 10 sec are discussed. Section 8 draws the conlusions.\nAn appendix gives some detail on the determination of\nreaction rates in the Born approximation.\n\nII. BOUND-STATE BBN AND PRIOR\nSUGGESTED SOLUTIONS TO THE 7 LI\nPROBLEM\n\nModifications to BBN occur due to the formation of\nelectrically bound states between the negatively charged\nCHAMPs and the positively charged nuclei. Since bound\nstate binding energies may be appreciable (cf. Table\n1), a significant fraction of 7 Be may be captured by\nCHAMPs at temperatures as high as T <\n\u223c 30 keV, whereas\n4\nthe same occurs at T <\n\u223c 10 keV for He. This may be seen\nin Fig. 1, which shows the fractions fib = n(Ni X \u2212 ) /ntot\nNi of\n7\n7\n6\n4\nBe, Li, Li, and He locked up within bound states. On\nfirst sight, the most important effect of bound states during BBN is a reduction of the Coulomb barrier [23, 24].\nNevertheless, since SBBN is essentially finished at T \u2248\n10 keV, Coulomb barrier modifications of reactions rates\ninvolving 4 He should be hardly important (even though,\n\n\f3\nad hoc, speculated otherwise in Ref. [24]). However,\nas shown by Pospelov [23] there is a non-trivial catalytic effect on reactions involving photons in the final\nstate. SBBN reaction rates involving dipole radiation\n(E1; e.g. 3 He(4 He, \u03b3)7 Be) scale as \u03bb\u22123\n\u03b3 , whereas reaction rates forbidden at the dipole approximation but allowed at quadrupole (E2; e.g. 2 H(4 He, \u03b3)6 Li) scale as\n\u03bb\u22125\n\u03b3 , where \u03bb\u03b3 is the wavelength of the emitted photon. This, in both cases is around \u223c 130 fm. In the\npresence of a 4 He-CHAMP bound state the reaction may\nproceed photonless (e.g., 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li) and \u03bb\u03b3\nis approximately replaced by the Bohr radius a4 He of the\n4\nHe-CHAMP bound system. Since a4 He \u2248 4.8 fm (cf.\nTable 1) very large enhancement factors of 7 \u00d7 107 and\n3 \u00d7 105 [23, 30] for the S-factors of the 2 H + 4 He, and\n3\nHe + 4 He reactions, respectively, have been estimated.\nA recent more detailed three-body nuclear reaction calculation of the 2 H + 4 He reaction, has reduced this estimate\nby a factor \u223c 10 [31]. Such large enhancement factors are\nimportant as they lead to excessive 6 Li (and 7 Li) production for any weak scale charged particles which are\n3\n<\n\u22126\nsufficiently long-lived \u03c4x >\n.\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s, unless \u03a9X \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\nThey have thus been utilised to place a stringent upper\nlimit on the reheat temperature in the early Universe\n7\nT<\n\u223c 10 GeV in the case when the supersymmetric gravitino exists and when it is the LSP [32]. Nevertheless, it\nseems somewhat premature to set such upper limits, as\nthe BBN with charged long-lived particles for decay times\n6\n\u03c4X >\n\u223c 10 s had priorly not been investigated (cf. Section\n8).\nThe putative existence of bound states during BBN\nhas also led to a flood of claims of possible solutions to\nthe 7 Li and/or 6 Li anomalies. In Ref. [24] it was realized that significant fractions of the 7 Be and 7 Li isotopes\nare within bound states during BBN. This has lead the\nauthors to arbritrarily enhance certain reactions rates\ninvolving mass-7 element destruction processes by large\nfactors, leading to the claim that the existence of bound\nstates may solve the 7 Li overproduction problem. However, these claims are, up to now, unfounded [33] (see\nalso below). In Ref. [25] it was noted that during the decay of X \u2212 , when residing in a bound state with 4 He, the\n4\nHe nucleus could break up. The resultant energetic 3 H\nand 3 He could then fuse on 4 He to produce 6 Li, in a similar to what had been proposed in [15, 17]. Though the\nsuggestion is correct, the authors calculate the break-up\nprobability to be very small (cf. also Ref. [35]), such that\nthe 6 Li synthesis by catalytic 2 H (4 He-X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li is by\nfar dominant. The analysis of Ref. [30] (and Ref. [34])\nessentially confirms the simultaneous solutions to the 6 Li\nand 7 Li problems as given in Ref. [21, 22], even when\nbound state effects are included. In Ref. [36] the case\nof almost degenerate NLSP staus \u03c4\u0303 and LSP neutralinos \u03c7\u0303 has been considered. Here mass splittings smaller\nthan \u03b4m = m\u03c4\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7\u0303 <\n\u223c 1 GeV have been assumed. In\nthis region of \u03c4\u0303 -\u03c7\u0303 parameter space, motivated by the\nwell-known \u03c4\u0303 -\u03c7\u0303 coannihilation region for neutralino dark\nmatter, the stau is relatively long-lived due to final phase\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\nb\n\nfi 1e-04\n1e-05\n1e-06\n1e-07\n1e-08\n10\n\n1\n\nT (keV)\n\nFIG. 1: Bound state fractions fib \u2261 n(Ni X \u2212 ) /ntot\nNi of nuclei Ni\nbound to CHAMP X \u2212 as a function of temperature T , for a\nmodel with MX = 100 GeV and \u03a9X h2 = 0.1 (corresponding\nto a CHAMP-to-baryon ratio YX \u2212 = 4.26 \u00d7 10\u22122 /2). Shown\nare fib for 7 Be solid (red), 7 Li long-dashed (green), 6 Li shortdashed (blue), and 4 He dotted (purple), respectively. Nuclear\ndestruction of bound states results in a behaviour of fib different than that expected from simple estimates by the Saha\nequation. This is particularly seen in fib for 7 Li due to the\n1\nH(7 Li\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He + 4 He reaction.\n\nspace supression of the decay. It is claimed, that the 7 Li\noverproduction problem may be solved by internal conversion of staus in bound states with 7 Be, to neutralinos,\ne.g. (\u03c4\u0303 -7 Be)\u2192 \u03c7\u0303 + \u03bd\u03c4 +7 Li and the subsequent destruction of 7 Li by protons. It is argued that solutions to the\n7\nLi problem may be found for \u03b4m <\n\u223c 100 MeV even for the\nsmallest abundances of staus. A more detailed analysis\nof the 7 Be-bound state fraction via the Boltzmann equation shows, however, that only a very small fraction of\n7\nBe are within bound states, thus making modifications\nof the 7 Li abundance at low stau-density negligible. At\nlarger stau-densities some effect may result.\nRef. [35] make the interesting suggestion that the 7 Li\nproblem could be solved by catalytic conversion of 7 Be\nvia (7 Be-X \u2212 )(p, \u03b3)(8 B-X \u2212 ) and the subsequent betadecay of the 8 B \u21928 Be+e+ + \u03bde nucleus. This reaction would mostly occur via a p-7 Be resonance in the\n8\nB nucleus which, in the absence of bound states lies at\n769.5keV relative to the p-7 Be continuum. The catalysm\nin the reaction would then occur by a shifting of the\nresonance to \u2248 167 keV relative to the p-(7 Be-X \u2212) continuum since the (8 B\u2212X \u2212 ) bound state binding energy (E8 BX \u2212 \u2248 2.0 MeV) is larger than that of 7 Be\n(E7 BeX \u2212 \u2248 1.39 MeV), making the resonance available\nat only slightly supra-thermal energies. Moreover, apart\nfrom the decrease in the resonance energy they also\ndeduce a factor \u223c 103 larger reaction rate coefficient.\nAdopting their calculated rates for 7 Be-X \u2212 bound state\nformation and the (7 Be-X \u2212 )(p, \u03b3)(8 B-X \u2212 ) reaction, I\npartially confirm this effect by full numerical analysis.\nFor example, for \u03c4X = 1.5 \u00d7 103 s and the number ratio\n\n\f4\nof X \u2212 s to baryons YX \u2248 0.2, I find a reduction of the\nLi abundance by 33%, and a 6 Li/H ratio of 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 .\nHowever, the effect is not as strong as initially imagined, since by the reciprocity theorem the inverse rate\nis also enhanced. The inverse rate 1/\u03c4inv is thus around\n103 times larger at T \u2248 32.5 keV than the beta decay\nrate 1/\u03c4\u03b2 of 8 B (half-time of 770 ms), converting 8 B-X \u2212\nrapidly back to 7 Be-X \u2212 + p, before 8 B can beta-decay.\nThe effect is therefore essentially absent at early times\n(i.e. small \u03c4X ). Nevertheless, the inverse rate quickly\ndrops below the beta decay rate (i.e. \u03c4\u03b2 /\u03c4inv \u2248 0.1 at\nT \u2248 24.1 keV). For the same parameters as above, I still\nfind a 14% reduction of the final 7 Li. This drops to 7% ,\n2% for \u03c4X = 103 and 7 \u00d7 102 s, respectively.\nIt is interesting to know if the solution of the lithium\nproblems proposed in Ref. [21] is changed when the decaying relic is charged, such as the stau. In Fig. 2 the\nparameter space solving either the 7 Li problem, or both\nthe 6 Li and 7 Li problems, is shown. The upper panel\nshows results for a charged relic and the lower panel for\na neutral relic. Here observational limits as discussed in\nRef. [37] have been applied and the 6 Li, 7 Li problems\nare assumed to be reconciled with observational data for\n6\n7\n1\n<\n\u221210\nLi/7 Li >\n. The assumed\n\u223c 0.03 and Li/ H \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\nparameters of the model are a hadronic branching ratio\nBh = 10\u22124 and relic mass MX = 1 TeV. It is seen that\neven at Bh as small as 10\u22124 the 7 Li-solving region is essentially unmodified, whereas some changes are observed\nin the 6 Li and 7 Li solving regions. These latter are mostly\ndue to excessive 6 Li production when the relic is charged,\n4\ndisallowing some of the larger life times \u03c4X >\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 s.\nBound state effects are nevertheless important when the\nhadronic branching ratio is very small. This may be seen\nin the lowest panel of Fig. 2, where Bh = 0 has been assumed. When only bound state effects are operative, the\n2\nH/1 H-ratio is essentially unmodified. This is in contrast\nto the solution of the lithium problems with a hadronic\ndecay, as seen by the dotted (blue) lines in the upper\ntwo panels, beyond which 2 H/1 H is larger than 4 \u00d7 10\u22125.\nIt is intriguing that both processes, hadronic decay and\nbound state effects, have the same preferred \u03c4X for a\nsimultaneous solution of the lithium problems.\n\n7\n\nIII.\n\nDETAILED BOUND-STATE BBN\nCALCULATIONS\n\nThe calculations presented here attempt to take proper\naccount of the influence of singly bound states on the nucleosynthesis for elements with nucleon number A \u2264 7.\nHeavier elements as well as the formation of molecules,\nsuch as (X \u2212 \u22124 He \u2212 X \u2212 ), are not considered. All effects\nof electromagnetic and hadronic cascade nucleosynthesis are included and treated as presented in Ref. [37].\nThe fractions of inividual nuclei i in bound states fib =\nn(Ni X \u2212 ) /ntot\nNi are computed by full numerical integration\nof the Boltzman equation. This is required since estimates by the Saha equation are only very approximative,\n\nTABLE I: Nucleus, energy of bound state, approximative\nBohr radius of bound state aB [38], and adopted root-meansquare charge radius for nucleus\n1/2\n\nnucleus Eb (keV) \u2248 aB (fm) hr 2 ic (f m)\n1\nH\n24.97\n28.8\n0.895\n2\n49.5\n14.4\n1.3\nH\n3\nH\n72.6\n9.6\n1.7\n3\nHe\n269\n5.2\n1.951\n4\n349.6\n4.8\n1.673\nHe\n6\nLi\n842.5\n2.1\n2.37\n7\nLi\n897.6\n1.9\n2.50\n7\nBe\n1385\n1.5\n2.50\n\ndue to the relatively early freeze-out of the CHAMPnuclei recombination process [24]. Except of the recombination rate of X \u2212 on 7 Be, which is taken from Ref. [35],\nall other recombination rates are computed by a numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. This may\nmake difference up to a factor two in fib since the recombination rates as given in Ref. [24] only apply asymptotically at low temperature T . Bound state wave functions\nand bound-state energies are also computed by an integration of the Schroedinger equation, assuming realistic\ncharge radii for the nucleus as measured by experiment.\nThe reader is referred to Table 1, for some of the bound\nstate properties. Finally, it is important, to take into account the nuclear destruction of bound states. Nuclear\nrates are very fast at early times, and for reaction which\nare sufficiently exothermic, the electric bound between\nthe final nucleus (nuclei) ought to be destroyed [39]. This\noften changes fib by orders of magnitude.\nA proper evaluation of BBN yields with bound states\nis only possible when somewhat realistic nuclear reaction\nrates for nuclei within bound states are present. With the\nexception of the reaction 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li a more\ndetailed evaluation of such reactions had been absent of\nthe literature so far. Improving over simple scaling relations [23, 30] seems important also, since nuclear reactions including bound states contain three quantities of\nsimilar magnitude, aB the Bohr ratius, anucl the nuclear\nnuclear radius, and kf the momentum of the outgoing\nnucleus. All three quantities are in the several Fermi\nrange, thus leading potentially to important cancellation\neffects. More importantly, estimates via simple scaling\nrelations adopt the Born approximation, which is known\nto fail at low energies and strong perturbations [40]. This\nis essentially the case for all reactions of importance to\nbound-state BBN. The failure of the Born approximation had been seen, for example, by the reduction of the\n2\nH(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li rate by a factor \u223c 10, when a more\ndetailed evaluation [31] is compared to a simple scaling\nresult.\nI have identified all key reactions in bound-state BBN.\n\n\f5\n100\n\n1\n\n10\n1\n\nYX\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n100\n1\n\n1000\n\nS(E) (MeV barn)\n1e-04\n0.01\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nE (100 keV)\n\nYX\n0.1\n100\n1\n\n1000\n\nYX\n0.1\n\n\u03c4 (sec)\n100\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 2: Parameter space in the relic particle-to-baryon ratio YX and relic particle decay time \u03c4X which may resolve\neither the 7 Li problem (green - light) or both, the 7 Li and\n6\nLi problems (red - dark).

All\nthree panels assume a mass Mx = 1 TeV for the relic. By\ncomparison of the green (lighter) areas it is seen that boundstate effects on 7 Li, as suggested in Ref.

Above the dotted lines the 2 H/1 H\nratio exceeds a value of 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nThese are shown in Table 2. It is completely beyond the\nscope of the present paper to evaluate all these reaction\nrates more properly, i.e. beyond the Born approximation, a task which is formidable in particular when the\nimportant CHAMP-exchange reactions (cf. Section 6)\nare also considered. For the 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li process the rate as given by Ref. [31] was adopted. For other\nreactions, as a starting point, I have thus nevertheless,\nevaluated rates in the Born approximation. These rates\nwill serve as benchmarks later on.

The most important S-factors for nuclear reactions involving bound states\nwith Z = 1 nuclei are shown: (from top to bottom\nat the highest energies) 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He+3 He doubledotted (black), 7 Be(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 B long-dashed (green),\n4\nHe(3 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Li dotted (purple), 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li\ndash-dotted (light-blue), 7 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , \u03b3)(8 Be \u2212 X \u2212 ) shortdashed (blue), and 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Be solid (red).\n\nwhen one after the other, non-negligible fraction of 3 H,\nH, and 1 H enter into bound states. This may be seen\nin Fig. 5. It is noted here, that a possible impact of\nsuch reactions has been pointed out before [24], albeit in\na very approximative way. It was not clear, a priori, if\nthe Coulomb barrier between, for example, 1 H and 6 Li is\nsufficiently supressed in order to make reactions such as\n6\nLi(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He + 3 He efficient enough to substantially reduce any priorly synthesized 6 Li. This is because,\non first sight, Coulomb shielding of the proton could\nonly be partial, due to the fairly extended Bohr radius\naB \u2248 29 fm of the 1 H-X \u2212 system. In Fig. 6 a l = 0 spherical wave without any Coulomb repulsion, i.e. Vc = 0, is\ncompared to the spherical Coulomb wave functions between the 6 Li and the 1 H-X \u2212 bound state with l = 0 and\nl = 1 initial angular momentum, respectively. It is seen\nthat essentially no Coulomb supression exists. Rather,\nthe incoming wave function of the 6 Li nuclei is even\nstrongly enhanced at the center. This is not surprising,\nas by assumption, the X \u2212 resides at the center, and due\nto the significant spread in the wave function of the proton (aB \u2248 29 fm) the effective proton charge density at\nthe center is low. The Coulomb potential for the 6 Li nucleus is \u03c66 Li = \u22123e2 exp(\u22122r/aB )(1/r + 1/aB ), thus very\nattractive at the center and approaching zero at large\ndistances. Nuclear reactions between such bound states\nand bare nuclei, are therefore not Coulomb supressed. It\nis rather conceivable, that Coulomb focussing occurs at\nlow energies, even enhancing the reaction rates over the\nVC = 0 case. This may be observed in the S-factor for the\n(1 H-X \u2212 ) + 6 Li\u2192 4 He + 3 He + X \u2212 reaction as shown\nin Fig. 4. It is noted here, that due to an anomously\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nT (keV)\n\nFIG. 5: Bound state fractions fib for 3 H (solid - red), 2 H\n(dashed - green), and 1 H (blue - dotted) as a function of temperature T .

Section 6) have not been taken\ninto account.\n\nlow 7 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 Be rate found in the Born approximation the rate for 7 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , \u03b3)(8 Be\u2212X \u2212 ) has been\ncomuputed and utilised in the calculations.\nThus, Z = 1 bound states at T \u2248 1 keV behave\nalmost as neutrons (with the exception that they are\nstable). Already very small fractions of these bound\nstates induce therefore a second round of late-time nucleosynthesis, capable of destroying all the synthesized\n6\nLi,9 Be, and some of the 7 Li. This may be seen in Fig. 7\nwhere the 6 Li/H, 7 Li/H, 7 Be/H, and 2 H/H ratios are\nshown for a CHAMP with \u03a9X h2 = 0.01, mX = 100\nGeV, and decay time \u03c4X = 1010 s, where h is the dimensionless present-day Hubble parameter, and \u03a9X [41] the\nfractional contribution of CHAMPs to the present critical density, would they not have decayed. Note, that\nthis is easily converted to the CHAMP-to-baryon ratio\nYX = (\u03a9X h2 /\u03a9b h2 )(mp /mX ) which is YX \u2248 4.26 \u00d7 10\u22123\nfor the adopted parameters. The calculations presented\nin Fig. 7 (as well as Figs. 1 and 5) are performed under the assumption that the X decay is not associated with any electromagnetic- or hadronic- energy release and in the absence of X-exchange reactions (cf.\nSection 6). This is done to isolate the effects of the\nbound states. At early times, towards the end of conventional BBN, when a significant fraction of 4 He enters bound states, the reactions 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li,\n3\nH(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Li, and 3 He(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Be, synthesize significant, and observationally completely unacceptable abundances of the A > 4 isotopes. However,\nwhen bound states of the Z = 1 elements form at T \u2248\n1 keV, essentially all the synthesized 6 Li and 7 Be may be\nrapidly destroyed by the reactions 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He\n+ 3 He and 7 Be(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 B.

Rather, both Coulomb wave functions\nare significantly enhanced at the center, due to the presence\nof X \u2212 at r = 0. The oscillatory behaviour may lead to important interference effects. Both, the l = 0 and l = 1 initial\nstates have significant contributions to the cross section.\n\n(AX) + B \u2192 C + X\nenhancement\n1.25 \u00d7 102\nH(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )3 He\n1\nH(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )3 He\n3\nH(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He\n11\n10.7\n1\nH(3 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He\n12 2 H(3 H\u2212X \u2212 , n)4 He+X \u2212\n1\n3\nH(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , n)4 He+X \u2212\n13 3 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , p)4 He+X \u2212\n1\n2\n\n1e-04\n1e-06\nni/nH\n1e-08\n1e-10\n1e-12\n1e-14\n1e-16\n100\n\nthe 7 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 Be and 7 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , \u03b3)8 Be-X \u2212\ncross sections, implying that almost all initially synthesized 7 Li is left intact [42]. The abundance of\n7\nLi/H is found at an observationally friendly 2.7 \u00d7\n10\u221210 . It is noted that 2 H is also destroyed, though\nto a much smaller degree, mostly by the reactions\n3\nH(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , n)4 He+X \u2212 , 3 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , p)4 He+X \u2212 , and\n2\nH(3 H\u2212X \u2212 , n)4 He+X \u2212 , and to a lesser degree by\n2\nH(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )3 He. The reader is referred to Table\n3 concerning assumptions about the rate of these, and\nsome other reactions involving only A \u2264 4 elements.\nFurthermore, when regarding Fig. 7 in more detail, one\nalso notes late-time production of 6 Li and 7 Be at some\nlevel due to the 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li as well as the\n6\nLi(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Be reactions.\nIt is thus premature to conclude, that extreme 6 Li\noverproduction, rules out the existence of CHAMPs with\nlong life times [23, 43]. The model shown above, at\nCHAMP densities many (five !) orders above those already claimed to be ruled out by 6 Li overproduction is observationally viable in all abundances. Constraints on the\nexistence of CHAMPs in the early Universe could therefore, in principle, be much milder for long X \u2212 life times\nthan initially predicted. Nevertheless, they is further important physics entering the calculations discussed in the\nnext two sections.\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\nT (keV)\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nFIG. 7: Evolution of light-element number ratios 7 Be/1 H\n(solid - red), 7 Li/1 H (long-dashed - green), 6 Li/1 H (shortdashed - blue), and 2 H/1 H (dotted - purple), for a CHAMP\nmodel with MX = 100 GeV, \u03a9X h2 = 0.01, and \u03c4X = 1010 s.\nIt is seen that large amounts of 6 Li and 7 Be synthesized at\nT \u2248 10 keV will be again destroyed at T \u2248 1 keV. Neither\neffects due to electromagnetic and hadronic energy release\nduring CHAMP decay nor charge exchange effects have been\ntaken into account.\n\nV. PHOTODISINTEGRATION OF BOUND\nSTATES BY THE DECAY OF THE CHAMPS\n\nThere is another effect, heretofore overlooked, which\nmay significantly reduce the in catalytic BBN at T \u2248\n10 keV synthesized 6 Li (and 7 Li) abundance. CHAMP\ndecays are typically accompanied by the injection of electromagnetically interacting partcles, with total energy\ncomprising often a large fraction of the X rest mass.\nIt is well-known, that such particles (e\u2212 , e+ , and \u03b3's)\ninduce a rapid cascade on the cosmic blackbody photons, due to \u03b3\u03b3BB pair creation and inverse Compton\nscattering e\u00b1 + \u03b3 processes, until the energy of any remaining \u03b3's is too low to further pair-produce, i.e. for\n2\n\u22121\nE\u03b3 <\n. It is\n\u223c Eth \u2248 me /22T \u2248 1.2 MeV(T /10keV)\n\n\f8\nseen, that this energy is above the binding energy of\n4\nHe-X \u2212 (and 1 H-X \u2212 ) even at temperatures as high as\nT \u2248 30 keV, making possible the 4 He-X \u2212 and (1 H-X \u2212 )\nbound state photodisintegration before any significant\n6\nLi synthesis (destruction) has occured. In Fig 8 the\nresultant photon spectrum due to the injection of energetic electromagnetically interacting particles at cosmic epochs with temperature T = 10, 1, and 0.1 keV is\nshown. The shown spectrum E\u03b3 dn\u03b3 /dlnE\u03b3 is generated\nby a Monte-Carlo simulation taking account, not only of\ne\u00b1 pair production and inverse Compton scattering, but\nalso \u03b3\u03b3 scattering (important at high E\u03b3 <\n\u223c Eth , BetheHeitler pair production \u03b3 + p, 4 He \u2192 p, 4 He + e\u2212 + e+ ,\nCompton scattering of the produced e\u00b1 , as well as the\nimportant Thomson (Klein-Nishina) scattering of \u03b3's on\nthermal electrons. It is based on the calculations presented in Ref. [37], with the Thomson scattering process\nextended to energies as low as E\u03b3 \u2248 25 keV, to account\nfor 1 H-X \u2212 destruction.\nFollowing secondary and tertiary, etc. generations of\nscattered photons to obtain the correct photon spectrum\nfor the bound state destructions process is mandatory.\nFor example, the injection of 1 TeV of electromagnetically interacting energy at T = 1 keV is associated with\ninjection of N\u03b3 \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 106 primary photons with energy E\u03b3 >\n\u223c 25 keV, resulting from the initial cascade on\nthe blackbody. When further interactions of these \u03b3's\nare considered the number rises to N\u03b3 \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 108 . In\nother words, an injected photon takes about 30 interactions before dropping below the threshold for 1 H-X \u2212\nphotodisintegration. This exemplifies the importance of\nsubsequent \u03b3 interactions. In Fig. 8 one may note a \"pileup\" of photons at low E\u03b3 . This is due to the typical fractional loss of \u03b3's in the Thomson regime E\u03b3 <\n\u223c me being\nsmall, such that it takes several Thomson scatterings for\nb\na photon to have dropped below E\u03b3 <\n\u223c E1 H \u2248 25 keV. A\n< b\nsimiliar pile-up does not exist at E\u03b3 \u223c E4 He \u2248 350 keV\nsince during scatterings of \u03b3's with energy E\u03b3 \u223c me on\nelectrons the \u03b3's may loose a significant fraction of their\nenergy. We thus expect the effects of photodisintegration of bound states have a larger impact on the 1 H-X \u2212\nbound state fraction than on that of 4 He-X \u2212 . This effect\nis not only due to the above, but also due to the photodisintegration cross section of 1 H-X \u2212 , \u03c31\u03b3H\u2212X \u2212 being larger\nthan the one for 4 He-X \u2212 . Note that all calculations below, include numerically evaluated cross sections for the\nphotodisintegration of all A \u2264 7 nuclei bound states.\nIn Fig. 9 the bound state fractions in two scenarios: (a) of 4 He for a model with \u03a9X h2 = 0.1 and\n\u03c4X = 3 \u00d7 104 s (and electromagnetic decay), and (b) of\n1\nH for \u03a9X h2 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03c4X = 3 \u00d7 106 s, are shown\nin the same graph. Here the solid lines show f4bHe (f1bH )\nwhen non-thermal bound state photodestruction is included, whereas the dotted lines show results when it is\nneglected. It is seen that realistic bound state fractions\nare significantly lower. In scenario (a) a 6 Li/H ratio \u223c 10\ntimes lower results, compared to when photodestruction\nis neglected, whereas in scenario (b) the 6 Li/H ratio is\n\n3000\nE dn/dlnE\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nE (MeV)\n\nFIG. 8: Resultant photon spectrum E\u03b3 dn\u03b3 /d lnE\u03b3 due to\nelectromagnetic energy injection at cosmic epochs with temperatures at T = 10 keV (solid -red), 1 keV (dashed - green),\nand 0.1 keV (dotted - blue), respectively. The normalisation of the spectrum is arbritrary. The fraction of photons\nwith energy above the 4 He-X \u2212 photodisintegration threshold\nE4b \u2248 350 keV is \u2248 1.9%, 3.7%, and 4.7% for temperatures\nT = 10, 1, and 0.1 keV, respectively.\n\n\u223c 100 times higher. Here case (b) is affected by a reduced\nefficiency of 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He + 3 He, whereas in case\n(a) the reaction 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li is rendered less\ndominant. For sufficently high \u03a9X , and when thermal\nphotodisintegration is unimportant, the resultant bound\nstate fraction may be estimated by a steady state between\nthe recombination rate, i.e. h\u03c3virec n4 He nX \u2212 and the\nphotodisintegration rate, i.e. h\u03c3ciph n(4 He\u2212X\u2212 ) n\u03b3 . Here\nn4 He , n(4 He\u2212X\u2212 ) , nX \u2212 , and n\u03b3 are free 4 He, bound 4 He,\nX \u2212 , and nonthermal photon number densities, respectively. The nonthermal photon number density n\u03b3 may\nbe obtained from n\u03b3 \u2248 dnX /dt \u03c4T h NE\u03b3 b where dnX /dt \u2248\nnX /\u03c4X before substantial decay, \u03c4T h is the life time of\nphotons against Thomson scattering (i.e. the typical survival time), and NE\u03b3 b is the typical number of photons per\nparticle decay with energy above the photodisintegration\nthreshold Eb (including secondary generations). This,\nfor example at T = 1 keV, is approximately 4 \u00d7 106 and\n1 \u00d7 108 for 4 He and 1 H bound state photodisintegration,\nrespectively, per 1 TeV of electromagnetically interacting\nenergy injected into the plasma.

In Section 5 it has\nbeen seen that the efficiency of this destruction may be\nsignificanlty reduced when non-thermal photodestruction\nof bound states is taken into account. In this section,\na further important process reducing late-time 6 Li and\n9\nBe destruction is discussed. CHAMPs in bound states\nmay exothermically transfer to heavier nuclei of equal\nor higher charge. In particular, (1 H\u2212X \u2212 ) bound states\ncould be removed by the (1 H\u2212X \u2212 ) + 4 He\u2192 (4 He\u2212X \u2212 )\n+ 1 H charge exchange process. Charge exchange reactions turn out to be very important. In Table 4 the most\nimportant of these processes are presented. Rates for\nthese processes were calculated in a very similiar way, i.e.\n\n1e-16\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\nT (keV)\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nFIG. 11: As Fig. 7 but with charge exchange reactions included.\n\nin the Born approximation, to those of nuclear reactions\ninvolving bound states, as presented in Appendix A. Here\nthe dipole (quadrupole) operators Eq. (A4) (Eq. A5)\nreplaced by the electromagnetic potential between the\nbound state and the heavier nucleus. The same arguments as presented in Section 3 apply concerning the failure of the Born approximation. In particular, rates given\nin Table 4 should be only considered as benchmarks, with\nthe true rates possibly deviating significantly.\nFig. 10 shows bound state fractions for the same model\nas that shown in Fig. 5, but now with CHAMP exchange\nreactions included (photodisintegration of bound states\nis neglected). From the comparison of these two figures\nit is evident that whereas bound state fractions of 1 H\nin the absence of exchange reactions reach levels close\nto fpb \u2248 10\u22123 , they are two orders of magnitude below\nwhen exchange reactions are present. This is mostly due\nto the (1 H\u2212X \u2212 ) + 4 He\u2192 (4 He\u2212X \u2212 ) + 1 H reaction. A\nfor the final BBN yield almost equally important change\nis the elevated 2 H (and 3 H) bound state fraction when\n\n\f10\nthe reactions in Table 4 are included. Though most 1 H\nexchange their CHAMPs with 4 He, due to the large 4 He\nabundance, a large fraction \u223c 1 of 2 H enter bound states\nby capture of CHAMPs from protons as well. The 2 H\nbound state fraction in Fig. 10 (as well as Fig. 11) is\nb\nonly small fD\n\u226a 1, simply because once a 2 H (and 3 H)\nbound state has formed, its life time against destruction\nby reactions shown in Table 3, is very short. In other\nwords, essentially each 2 H which enters a bound state\nwill be subsequently destroyed, leading to the production of 3 He and 4 He. This will have important consequences for bounds on CHAMPs at larger CHAMP density, since either the lower bound on 2 H or the upper\nbound on 3 He/2 H may be violated. Fig. 11 shows the\nabundance evolution corresponding to Fig. 10, and is the\nequivalent to Fig. 7 but now with exchange reactions\nswitched on. Several trends are visible: With charge\nexchange reactions the 2 H/H ratio has fallen below the\nobservational lower limit, i.e. 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 compared to\n2 \u00d7 10\u22125 in Fig. 7, the final 7 Li/H ratio is larger, i.e.\n9.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 compared to 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221210, and the 6 Li/H ratio\nis much larger, i.e. 3.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 compared to \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 .\nHere 7 Li is larger due to reduced 7 Be(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 B\nand enhanced 4 He(3 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Li efficiencies, and 6 Li\nis larger due to reduced 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He +3 He and\nenhanced 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li reactions.\nWhen doing bound-state BBN computations with reactions on Z = 1 bound states as well as CHAMP exchange reactions included often very counter-intuitive\nresults are obtained. As only one example, when the\n(1 H\u2212X \u2212 ) + 2 H rate is increased the 6 Li (and 7 Be) abundance may be reduced drastically. This is not what is expected since a lower (1 H\u2212X \u2212 ) and higher (2 H\u2212X \u2212 ) fraction ought to lead to a higher 6 Li abundance via enhanced\n4\nHe(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li and reduced 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He\n+3 He. Nevertheless, this is not what happens, due to a\nhigher (2 H\u2212X \u2212 ) fraction more 2 H is destroyed initially,\nrendering the 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li less effective at late\ntimes. Since the final abundance yield is given by the balance of the still fast processes of 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li\nproduction and 6 Li(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )4 He +3 He destruction at late times less 6 Li results. Due to a lower\n6\nLi(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Be efficiency less 7 Be results. Latetime bound-state BBN is very non-linear requiring full\nnumerical integration up to late times to obtain reliable\npredictions.\n\nVII.

Here reaction rates in the Born\napproximation were adopted and electromagnetic- and\nhadronic- energy injection due to the X decay was neglected, corresponding to, for example, an invisible decay\nor a decay to a neutral daughter particle almost degenerate in mass with the CHAMP. The model also approximates well the case of no decay, i.e. a stable CHAMP.\nAt low CHAMP-to-baryon ratio Yx only 6 Li is modified. Here most of the 6 Li is synthesized not at early\ntimes due to 2 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li but rather at late\ntimes due to 4 He(2 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )6 Li. A small CHAMP\ndensity may therefore easily account for 6 Li in Pop II\nstars. When Yx increases to 10\u22128 too much 6 Li is synthe\u22123 6\nsized. For larger Yx >\nLi destruction due to a high\n\u223c 10\n1\n\u2212\n( H-X ) fraction reduces 6 Li again to observationally\nfriendly levels. However, such models are then ruled out\nby 7 Li overproduction and 2 H underproduction, due to\nhigh (2 H-X \u2212 ) and (3 H-X \u2212 ) fractions, with 7 Li produced\nby 3 H(4 He\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )7 Li and 2 H destroyed by reactions\ngiven in Table 3. When the decay is electromagnetic or\nhadronic, with a large fraction fEM \u223c 1 of rest mass\nof X converted to electromagnetically interacting particles such high Yx should in any case be ruled out due to\nelevated 3 He/2 H-ratios (cf. Ref. [37]).\nNevertheless, significant uncertainties exist due to the\nuncertainties in the bound-state nuclear reactions and\ncharge exchange reactions. In Tables V and VI three\n(somewhat randomly chosen) models which do solve the\n6\nLi and 7 Li problems are shown. Here a number of reaction rates were scaled up (or down) from the Born approximation in order to arrive at an observationally satisfying result. It is seen that even at low Yx such models\nmay exist, depending on the exact magnitude of rates\nfor a variety of reactions. It is also seen that, when going to lower Yx , rates have to deviate more drastically\nfrom the Born approximation in order to solve the 6 Li\n\n10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n\nYx\n10-4\n10-5\n10-6\n106\n\n\u03c4 x (sec)\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n109\n\n1010\n\n1011\n\n1012\n\nFIG. 14: Probability in the CHAMP-to-baryon Yx - CHAMP\nlife time \u03c4x parameter space at large \u03c4x that simultaneous\nsolutions to the 7 Li and 6 Li (dark-blue) or only 7 Li (lightblue) problems exist. The points indicate 1 \u2212 5% probability,\nwhereas white areas had less than 1% of all randomly chosen\nreaction rates in the Monte-Carlo analysis result in 6 Li and\n7\nLi (or 7 Li only) solutions. No electromagnetic- or hadronicenergy release has been taken into account. Areas above the\nred line would be ruled out due to electromagnetic cascade\nnucleosythesis under the assumption that fEM = 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 of\nthe rest mass of the CHAMP is converted to electromagntically interacting energy. See text for further detail.\n\nand 7 Li problems. The corresponding abundance yields\nfor Model C, where at low Yx observationally satisfying\nresults are obtained, are shown in Fig. 13. The figure\nclearly indicates that parameter space for a reduction of\n7\nLi and production of some 6 Li exists.\nIn the absence of reliable estimates for reaction rates\nit is difficult to assess quantitatively if significant parameter space for simultaneous solutions for the 6 Li and 7 Li\n6\ndiscrepancies for late decaying \u03c4X >\n\u223c 10 sec CHAMPs exist. In particular all nuclear reactions shown in Table II\nand Table III, as well as the charge exchange reactions\n\n\f12\nshown in Table IV, i.e. a total number of nineteen reactions. Though all rates have been determined numerically in the Born approximation in this paper, as the\nBorn approximation is likely to fail badly, results become\nuncertain. In order to still arrive at a reliable result one\nis thus forced to perform a Monte-Carlo analysis, varying all ill-determined reaction rates within conservative\nranges. This has been done in the present paper. In particular, the Born approximation values of the rates shown\nin Figs. 3 and 4, as well as given in Table III and IV, have\nbeen taken as benchmarks. For each reaction a random\ngenerator determined a factor fi with which the benchmark rate was multiplied. These factors where generated\nwith a probability distribution flat in logarithmic space,\nand between values 1/ficut \u2264 fi \u2264 ficut . For the reactionrate dependent conservatively chosen ficut the reader is\nreferred to Table VII. For each point in parameter space,\ni.e. for Yx and \u03c4x , this procedure was repeated a 1000\ntimes in order to arrive with one thousand different randomly chosen sets for the 19 ill-determined reaction rates.\nFor each realization of reaction rates an indpendent BBN\ncalculation was then performed and compared to the observational constraints.\n\nThe results of this Monte-Carlo analysis are shown in\nFig. 14. Here dark (dark-blue) area indicates the probability that between 1% - 5% (i.e. 10-50) of all independent 1000 BBN calculations with randomly varied rates\nrespect the abundance limits on other light elements (as\ngiven in Ref. [37]) while fulfilling 7 Li/1 H< 2.5\u00d710\u221210 and\n0.66 >6 Li/7 Li> 0.03. Similarly, light (light-blue) areas\nindicate the same, but with now only the 7 Li discrepancy\nsolved (i.e. 6 Li/7 Li< 0.03) is acceptable). It is noted that\nin none of the parameter space a probability > 5% for\n6\nLi + 7 Li (or only 7 Li) solving areas is found, indicating that the reaction rate combinations which may yield\nsuch solutions are rather rare. The liklihood for such scenarios is even further diminished when electromagneticand/or hadronic- energy injection due to the decay of\nthe particle is considered. In fact, when fEM \u223c 1 all of\nthe parameter space shown in Fig. 14 capable of solving\nthe 6 Li+7 Li problems simultaneously (though at a < 5%\nliklihood), would be completely eliminated. Only when\nfEM is rather small, some area remains. This is shown\nby the (red) line for fEM = 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 corresponding, for\nexample, to the decay of a stau \u03c4\u0303 to a tau and gravitino,\nwith the gravitino only 10% lighter than the stau. The\narea above the line is ruled out by overproduction of the\n3\nHe/2 H ratio due to 4 He photodisintegration. On the\nother hand, not shown in Fig. 14 are areas where only\nthe 6 Li abundance as observed in Pop II stars may be\nproduced. These exist plentiful, and at high probability,\n\u22125\n. It thus seems unlikley\nin particular at lower Yx <\n\u223c 10\n>\n6\nthat CHAMPs with \u03c4x \u223c 10 sec may resolve the 7 Li problem, though they could possibly constitute the source for\nthe observed 6 Li at low metallicity.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, I have presented results of a very detailed study of BBN in the presence of negatively charged\nmassive particles (CHAMPs). Such particles have been\nshown to form bound states with nuclei towards the end\nof a conventional BBN epoch [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]\nand may alter BBN yields due to the catalysm of nuclear\nreactions [23]. The present analysis attempts to take into\naccount of all relevant effects for making relatively precise predictions of catalytic light-element nucleosynthesis\nfor nuclei with A \u2264 7, but excluding the formation of\nmolecules. It includes numerical evaluations in the Born\napproximation of all key nuclear cross sections, where\none of the nuclei is in a bound state. Bound-state recombination and photodisintegration cross sections are also\ndetermined numerically. Furthermore, three very important and priorly not treated effects for the CHAMP BBN\n5\nat late times \u03c4 >\n\u223c 10 sec are included: (a) rapid nuclear\nreactions including charge Z = 1 nuclei in bound states,\n(b) the photodisintegration of bound states due to \u03b3and x- rays generated during the decay of the CHAMPs,\nand (c) CHAMP-exchange reactions from a bound state\nwithin a lighter nucleus to a bound state within a heavier\nnucleus. Light element abundances and bound state fractions are computed without approximations. The effects\nof hadronic and electromagnetic cascades due to CHAMP\ndisintegration on light element abundances are properly\ntaken into account.\nThe present detailed study reveals that boundstate BBN proceeds very differently than initially forecasted [23, 24]. At low temperatures T <\n\u223c 1 keV, a large\nnumber \u223c 20 of Coulomb-barrier unsupressed nuclear\nreactions and charge exchange reactions become operative and are capable, in most of the parameter space, to\nchange 6 Li, 7 Li, and 2 H abundances by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, reaction rates for these processes\nare not well approximated by the Born approximation,\n5\nsuch that for CHAMP life times \u03c4x >\n\u223c 10 sec one has to\nresort to a Monte-Carlo analysis.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the potential\nof CHAMP BBN to resolve the current 6 Li and 7 Li discrepancies between standard BBN and observations. It\nis shown, that a priorly proposed simultaneous solution\nof the 6 Li and 7 Li problems with a relic particle decaying\nat \u03c4x \u2248 1000 sec [21], is not very dependent on the decaying relic being charged [35] or not, unless its hadronic\n\u22124\nbranching ratio is well below Bh <\n. A solution with\n\u223c 10\n\u22124\nBh \u226a 10 has, however, the advandtage to not change\nmuch the 2 H/1 H ratio from its respective standard BBN\nvalue. Since 6 Li and 7 Li may be rapidly destroyed at late\ntimes one generically expects further simultaneous solu6\ntions of the 6 Li and 7 Li problems for \u03c4x >\n\u223c 10 sec. Nevertheless, even given the current reaction rate uncertainties, a Monte-Carlo shows that only a very small fraction\n<\n\u223c 5% of reaction rate combinations may lead to such solutions. Since such possible solutions occur at relatively\n<\n\u22122\nhigh CHAMP-to-baryon ratio 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 <\nthey\n\u223c Yx \u223c 10\n\n\f13\nare further constrained by the effects of electromagnetic\nenergy injection and possible 3 He/2 H overproduction, requiring the decay to be invisible, or mother and daughter\nparticle to be somewhat degenerate in mass \u223c 10%. On\nthe other hand, CHAMPs may well be the source of the\nobserved 6 Li at low metallicity.\nI acknowledge helpful discussions with and M. Asplund, S. Bailly, O. Kartavtsev, K. Kohri, A. Korn,\nG.

The perturbation H1f was chosen as the first non-vanishing element\nin the expansion of the last two terms of Eq. (A1) in\nterms of relative coordinate \u03c1.

In Eq.

This Hamiltonian will be split into a dominant contribution H0 and\na perturbative contribution H1 \u226a H0 . In a rearrangement reaction of the type (A \u2212 X \u2212 ) + B \u2192 C + X \u2212 ,\nwhere C is a nuclear bound state between A and B, the\nunperturbed and perturbed Hamiltonians for initial and\nfinal states are different, i.e. H0i 6= H0f , H1i 6= H1f . In\nparticular, whereas in the initial state the perturbation\nis best chosen as the nuclear attraction beween A and B,\ni.e. H1i = VN UC and H0i = H \u2212 H1i , in the final state\nit will be the differential Coulomb force of X \u2212 on the\nnuclear bound state C = (A \u2212 B). When initial and final\nstates are chosen as eigenstates to H0i and H0f , respectively, standard methods show that, in the Born approximation the transition amplitude may be computed by\neither hi|H1f f i or hf |H0i ii.

Since for weak scale mass CHAMPs and\nlight nuclei MX \u226b MA , MB , it is an excellent approximation to assume X \u2212 to be at rest at the origin, effectively\nacting as an external potential whichs absorbs momentum but not energy.

For the\nevaluation of the matrix elements, six-dimensional integrals over the coordinates of two nuclei could be analytically reduced to three-dimensional integrals which were\nnumerically evaluated. Similiar to Ref. [31] I have not\nconsidered internal spin of the nuclei, except for the obvious total angular momentum degeneracy factors. Finally\ncross sections \u03c3(E) were converted to S-factors S(E) .\nThey are related by\n\u03c3(E) = (S(E)/E) exp(\u2212G(E)),\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere E is center-of mass (CM) energy and exp(G) with\nG(E) =\n\n2\u03c0(ZA \u2212 1)ZB \u03b1c\nvCM\n\n(A9)\n\nis the Coulomb repulsion factor.

This is clearly not so,\nas v is, simply, part of the flux factor at large distances,\ndefining the flux of incoming neutrons in the cosmic rest\nframe, which is essentially the rest frame of the heavy\n7\nBe-X \u2212 bound system. Due to the small thermal velocities of the heavy bound state, the relative velocity, and\nthus the reaction rate, is even reduced, but only about a\nfactor of order unity. See also Ref.

Yanagida on this point.\n[41] Throughout the paper, it is assumed that only half of\nthe stated \u03a9X abundance is within negatively charged\nspecies X \u2212 , with the other half in the antiparticle of X,\ni.e. X + , such that electrical neutrality is kept.\n[42] Naively thought, some of the 7 Li (synthesized as 7 Be)\ncould survive the rapid 7 Be(1 H\u2212X \u2212 , X \u2212 )8 B destruction\nreaction at T \u2248 1 keV if 7 Be would be converted to 7 Li\n6\n7\nat \u03c4 <\n\u223c 10 s. In fact, the half life for Be against electron\ncapture is \u03c47 Be \u2248 4.6 \u00d7 106 s. Nevertheless, the binding\nenergy of an electon to the 7 Be nucleus is Eb \u2248 0.21 keV,\nsuch that the 7 Be nucleus stays bare until much lower\ntemperatures T \u226a 1 keV. Since the electron plasma density is well below the effective density of electrons in a\nrecombined 7 Be nucleus, the 7 Be nuclei has to either avait\n\n\f15\nrecombination or \u03b2 + -decay to convert to 7 Li. Due to the\nrapidness of the 7 Be destruction process, it is therefore\nexpected that 7 Be \u21927 Li at low temperatures plays hardly\na role.\n[43] M. Kawasaki, K. Kohri and T. Moroi, Phys. Lett. B 649,\n\n436 (2007)\n[44] The effects of annihilation of X \u2212 with X + in X \u2212 \u2212 X +\nbound states forming to some degree [35] are subdominant compared to those of the decay itself.\n\n\f"}
