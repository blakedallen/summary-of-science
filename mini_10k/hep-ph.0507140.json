EXTRA DIMENSIONS\n\nm2p = Mfd+2 Rd\n\nModels with large extra dimensions (LXDs) are motivated by string theory [1] and provide us with an effective\ndescription of physics beyond the standard model (SM)\nin which observables can be computed and predictions\ncan be made. Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali [2]\nproposed a solution to the hierarchy problem by the introduction of d additional compactified space-like dimensions in which only the gravitons can propagate. The SM\nparticles are bound to our 4-dimensional sub-manifold,\noften called our 3-brane.\nThis yields an attractive and simple explanation of the\nhierarchy problem. Consider a particle of mass M located in a space time with d + 3 dimensions. The general\nsolution of Poisson's equation yields its potential as a\nfunction of the radial distance r to the source\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nIt can be seen from this argument that the volume of the\nextra dimensions suppresses the fundamental scale and\nthus, can explain the huge value of the observed Planck\nmass mp \u223c 1016 TeV.\nThe radius R of these extra dimensions, for Mf \u2248 TeV,\ncan be estimated with Eq.(3) and typically lies in the\nrange from 10\u22121 mm to 103 fm for d from 2 to 7, or\nthe inverse radius 1/R lies in energy range eV to MeV,\nrespectively.\nLXDs predict a vast number of new effects at energies\nclose to the new fundamental scale. Among the signatures are modifications of SM observables due to virtual\ngraviton exchange, the production of real gravitons and\nTeV-scale black holes. For recent constraints from collider searches and astrophysics see e.g. [4].\nII. BLACK HOLES IN EXTRA DIMENSIONS\n\n\u2217\n\nsabine@physics.arizona.edu\n\u2020\nkoch@th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de\n\u2021\nbleicher@th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de\n\nUsing the higher dimensional Schwarzschild-metric [5],\nit can be derived that the horizon radius RH of a black\n1\n\n\fThe evaporation process can be categorised in three\ncharacteristic stages [15]: the balding phase, the evaporation phase and the Planck phase. It is generally assumed\nthat in the last phase, the black hole will either completely decay in a few SM particles or a stable remnant\nwill be left, which carries away the remaining energy. In\nthe following we will focus on the case in which a remnant\nof approximately Planck mass is left.\nFor more details on the topic of TeV-scale black holes,\nthe interested reader is referred to the reviews [19].\n\nhole is substantially increased in the presence of LXDs,\nreflecting the fact that gravity at small distances becomes\nstronger. For a black hole of mass M one finds\nd+1\nRH\n=\n\nM\n2\nd + 1 Mfd+2\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe horizon radius for a black hole with mass \u2248 TeV is\nthen \u2248 10\u22123 fm, and thus RH \u226a R for black holes which\nmight possibly be produced at colliders or in ultra high\nenergetic cosmic rays.\nBlack holes with masses in the range of the lowered\nPlanck scale should be a subject of quantum gravity.\nSince there is yet no theory available to perform this analysis, the black holes are treated as semi classical objects.\nThe gravitational field is classical, though the evaporation process is a quantum effect.\nTo compute the production details, the cross-section\nof the black holes can be approximated by the classical\ngeometric cross-section\n2\n\u03c3(M ) \u2248 \u03c0RH\n\n,\n\nIII. BLACK HOLE REMNANTS\n\nThe final fate of these evaporating black holes is closely\nconnected to the information loss puzzle. The black hole\nemits thermal radiation, whose sole property is the temperature, regardless of the initial state of the collapsing\nmatter. So, if the black hole completely decays into statistically distributed particles, unitarity can be violated.\nThis happens when the initial state is a pure quantum\nstate and then evolves into a mixed state [20].\nWhen one tries to avoid the information loss problem\ntwo possibilities are left. The information is regained by\nsome unknown mechanism or a stable black hole remnant\nis formed which keeps the information. Besides the fact\nthat it is unclear in which way the information should\nescape the horizon [21] there are several other arguments\nfor black hole remnants [22]:\n\n(5)\n\nan expression which contains only the fundamental\nPlanck scale as coupling constant. This cross section\nis a subject of ongoing research [7] but close investigations justify the use of the classical limit at least up to\nenergies of \u2248 10Mf [8]. It has further been shown that\nthe naively expected classical result remains valid also in\nstring theory [9].\nA common approach to improve the naive picture\nof colliding point particles, is to treat the creation of\nthe horizon as a collision of two shock fronts in an\nAichelburg-Sexl geometry describing the fast moving particles [10,11]. Due to the high velocity of the moving particles, space time before and after the shocks is almost\nflat and the geometry can be examined for the occurrence\nof trapped surfaces.\nThese semi classical considerations do also give rise to\nform factors which take into account that not the whole\ninitial energy is captured behind the horizon. These factors have been calculated in [12], depend on the number\nof extra dimensions, and are of order one. They are included in our numerical evaluation. The scattering of\nthe emitted particle on the gravitational potential is also\ntaken into account in the graybody factors [13].\nSetting Mf \u223c 1TeV and d = 2 one finds \u03c3 \u2248 1 TeV\u22122 \u2248\n400 pb. With this it is further found that these black\nholes will be produced at LHC. For the estimated luminosity of 100/fb more than \u2248 108 black holes are expected\nper year [14]. The potential importance of the black hole\nproduction at colliders has been investigated in numerous\npublications, see e.g. [16,17] and References therein.\nOnce produced, the black holes will undergo an evaporation process whose thermal properties carry information about the parameters Mf and d. An analysis of the\nevaporation will therefore offer the possibility to extract\nknowledge about the topology of our space time and the\nunderlying theory.\n\n\u2022 The uncertainty relation: The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with Planck mass is of the order of the Planck length. Since the Planck length\nis the wavelength corresponding to a particle of\nPlanck mass, a problem arises when the mass of\nthe black hole drops below Planck mass. Then one\nhas trapped a mass inside a volume which is smaller\nthan allowed by the uncertainty principle [23]. To\navoid this problem, Zel'dovich has proposed that\nblack holes with masses below Planck mass should\nbe associated with stable elementary particles [24].\n\u2022 Corrections to the Lagrangian: The introduction of\nadditional terms, which are quadratic in the curvature, yields a dropping of the evaporation temperature towards zero [25]. This holds also for extra\ndimensional scenarios [26] and is supported by calculations in the low energy limit of string theory\n[27].The production of TeV-scale black holes in the\npresence of Lovelock higher-curvature terms has\nbeen examined in [28] and it was found that these\nblack holes can become thermodynamically stable\nsince their evaporation takes an infinite amount of\ntime.\n\u2022 Further reasons for the existence of remnants have\nbeen suggested: E.g. black holes with axionic\ncharge [29], the modification of the Hawking temperature due to quantum hair [30] or magnetic\n2\n\n\fOne can estimate the exact solution for the system by\nassuming it to be spherical symmetric up to the horizon\nradius. This yields\n\nmonopoles [31]. Coupling of a dilaton field to gravity also yields remnants, with detailed features depending on the dimension of space-time [32].\nOf course these remnants, which have also been termed\nMaximons, Friedmons, Cornucopions, Planckons or Informons, are not a miraculous remedy but bring some\nproblems on their own, e.g. the necessity for an infinite\nnumber of states which allows the unbounded information content inherited from the initial state.\nIn [33], it has been shown that the black hole remnants give rise to distinct collider signatures. In the\npresent work we will in particular examine the properties of charged remnants.\n\ngtt = \u03b3(r) = 1 \u2212 2\u03c6(r)\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the potential containing the gravitational energy and the Coulomb energy of the source whose electric\nfield is now also higher dimensional. The weak field limit\nof Einsteins field equations yields the Poisson equation\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6(r) = \u03a9(d+3) \u03b4(r)\n\nM\n\u03b1\nQ2\n+ 2(d+1) 2(d+2)\nd+2\nr\nMf\nMf\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03a9(d+3) is the surface of the d + 3-dimensional unit\nsphere\nIV. CHARGED BLACK HOLES\nd+3\n\n\u03a9(d+3) =\n\nThe black hole produced in a proton-proton collision\ncan carry an electric charge. The evaporation spectrum\ncontains all particles of the SM and so, a certain fraction\nof the final black hole remnants will also carry net electric charge. In the following, these charged black hole\nremnants will be denoted BH + and BH \u2212 , and the neutral ones BH 0 , respectively. Since the BH \u00b1 's undergo\nan electromagnetic interaction, their cross section is enhanced and they can be examined closely. This makes\nthem extremely interesting candidates for the investigation of Planck scale physics.\nThe metric of a charged black hole in higher dimensions\nhas been derived in [5]. This solution assumes the electric\nfield to be spherical symmetric in all dimensions whereas\nin the scenario with LXDs the SM fields are confined to\nour brane. This has also been pointed out in Ref. [34].\nThe exact solution for this system in a spacetime with\ncompacitfied extra dimensions is known only implicitely\n[6]. However, for our purposes, it will be sufficient to\nestimate the charge effects by taking into account that\nwe expect the brane to have a width of about 1/Mf . Up\nto this width, also the gauge fields can penetrate the\nbulk which is essentially a scenario of embedding universal extra dimensions as a fat brane into the large extra\ndimensions. Note, that this does not modify the electromagnetic coupling constants as there is no hierarchy\nbetween the inverse width and the radius of the fat brane.\nFollowing the same arguments leading to the Newtonian\npotential (Eq.(1)), we see that the Coulomb potential\nreceives a modification to\n\u03c6C =\n\n\u03b1\nQ\nd+1 rd+1\nMf\n\n,\n\n2\u03c0 2\n\u0393( d+3\n2 )\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nand the delta-function is already converted into spherical\ncoordinates. Using the spherical symmetry and applying\nGauss' Law yields then\n\u2202r \u03c6(r) = \u2212\n\nM\n1\n1\n\u03b1\nQ2\n+ 2(d+1)\nd+2 rd+2\n2d+3\nd+1r\nMf\nMf\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nAnd so we find\n\"\n#\n1\n1\n\u03b1Q2 Mf\u2212d\n1\nM\u2212\n\u03c6(r) =\nd + 1 Mfd+2 rd+1\n2(d + 1) rd+1\n\n. (11)\n\nThe horizon RH is located at the zero of \u03b3(r). In case\nthere exists no (real) solution for RH , the metric is dominated by the contribution of the electromagnetic field and\nthe singularity will be a naked one. The requirement of\n\u03b3 having a zero yields the constraint1\n\u03b1Q2 \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nMf\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nWith M = few \u00d7Mf , and Q being close by e, the\nleft hand side is at least by a factor 100 smaller than\nthe right hand side. So, the charge contribution to\nthe gravitational field, which is described by the second\nterm of Eq.(11), will be negligible at the horizon location RH \u223c 1/Mf . For the typical collider produced black\nholes, the singularity will not be naked. For the same reason, modifications of the Hawking evaporation spectrum\ncan be neglected in the charge range under investigation.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fine structure constant and Q is the dimensionless charge in units of the unit charge e. But\nthis higher dimensional potential will already turn into\nthe usual 1/r potential at a distance r = 1/Mf which\nmeans that the pre-factors cancel and \u03b1 does not collect\nany volume factors.\n\n1\n\nNote, that these relations do only agree with the relations in\n[5] up to geometrical pre-factors. This is due to the fact that\nour additional dimensions are compactified and the higher\ndimensional coupling constants are fixed by Eq (3) and (6).\n\n3\n\n\fdistribution of the charge of the emitted particles.\nTherefore, independent of the underlying quantum\ngravitational assumption leading to the remnant formation, we find that about 27.5% of the remnants carry zero\nelectric charge, whereas we have \u2248 17.7% of BH \u2212 and\n\u2248 23.5% of BH + .\nThe total number of produced black hole remnants\ndepends on the total cross section for black holes\n[16,17,37,38]. Ongoing investigations on the subject reveal a strong dependence on Mf and a slight dependence\non d and suggest the production of \u2248 108 black holes per\nyear. Thus, following the above given results we predict\nthe production of about 107 single charged BH \u00b1 remnants per year.\n\nLet us briefly comment on the assumption that the\nelectromagnetic field is spherical symmetric up to a brane\nwidth of \u223c 1/Mf . If the field is confined to a thinner\nbrane, the charge contribution to the gravitational potential will obey a different functional behaviour. It will\ndrop slower at large distances but therefore be less divergent at small distances. This means, if the above inequality is fulfilled it will still hold because the singularity is\neven better shielded.\nUsually, the Hawking radiation for very small charged\nblack holes necessarily leads to naked singularities which\nare hoped to be excluded by the (unproven) cosmic censorship hypothesis. The reason is that once the mass of a\ncharged black hole becomes smaller than the mass of the\nlightest charged particle - i.e. the electron or positron,\nrespectively - it could never get rid of its charge by radiating it off. Then, it would either end as a naked singularity or as a tiny remnant of mass about the electron\nmass. This case, however, can not occur in the here discussed setting as we assume the remnant mass to be close\nby Mf and therefore much above the electron mass.\n\n0.35\n0.3\n\nN/Ntot\n\n0.25\n\nV. CHARGED BLACK HOLE REMNANTS\n\nBlack holes are typically formed from valence quarks as\nthose carry the largest available momenta of the partonic\nsystem. So, the black holes formed in a proton-proton\ncollision will have an average charge of \u223c 4/3. The black\nholes decay with an average multiplicity of \u2248 10 \u2212 25 into\nparticles of the SM, most of which will be charged. The\ndetails of the multiplicity depend on the number of extra\ndimensions [33]. After the black holes have evaporated off\nenough energy to be stable at the remnant mass, some\nhave accumulated a net electric charge. According to\npurely statistical considerations, the probability for being\nleft with highly charged black hole remnants drops fast\nwith deviation from the average. The largest fraction of\nthe black holes should have charges \u00b11 or zero.\nFor a detailed analysis, we have estimated the fraction\nof charged black hole remnants with the PYTHIA event\ngenerator and the CHARYBDIS program [35,36]. For our\npurposes, we turned off the final decay of the black hole\nand the charge minimization. Figure 1 shows the results\nfor a simulation of proton-proton collisions\u221aat the LHC\nwith an estimated center of mass energy of s = 14 TeV.\nWe further assumed as an applicable model, worked\nout in [33], that the effective temperature of the black\nhole drops towards zero for a finite remnant mass MR .\nThis mass of the remnant is a few \u00d7Mf and a parameter of the model. Even though the temperature-mass\nrelation is not clear from the present status of theoretical examinations, such a drop of the temperature can\nbe implemented into the simulation. However, the details of the modified temperature as well as the value of\nMR do not noticeably affect the here investigated charge\ndistribution as it results from the very general statistical\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0.0\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nQ/e\nFIG. 1. Distribution\nblack hole remnant charges in\n\u221a\nP P -interactions at\ns = 14 TeV calculated with the\nPYTHIA event generator.\n\nThese charged black hole remnants are of special importance. Once produced, the BH \u00b1 could be singled out\nin an experiment before they are neutralized in a detector. The characteristically small Q/M makes them easy\nto distinguish from particles of the SM. Their electromagnetic interaction further allows it to trap and keep\nthem in an electromagnetic field.\nFor the specific scenario discussed here, the average\nmomenta of the black hole remnants are of the order of\np \u223c 1 TeV. We suggest to use a similar approach as used\nfor the trapping of anti-protons at LEAR/TRAP [39].\nThis means, first the remnants are decelerated in a decelerator ring from some GeV/c down to 100 MeV/c. Then\nthey have to be further slowed down by electric fields to a\ncouple of keV. This is slow enough to allow for a capture\nof the remnants in a Penning trap with low temperature.\nThen positrons (or electrons) are loaded into the trap.\nThe positrons/electrons cool down to the temperature\nof the Penning trap by the emission of cyclotron radia-\n\n4\n\n\fIn the case of anti-protons, the above discussed method\nallowed the TRAP collaboration to store the anti-protons\nfor many month. This time would be sufficient to collect\na huge amount of black hole remnants for study, even if\nonly a small percentage will have low enough energies for\ndeceleration.\nAnother approach to collect black hole remnants might\nbe to slow down the charged remnants by energy loss in\nmatter - a similar approach was suggested by [40] to stop\ngluinos. The energy loss experienced by a charged particle when travelling through matter can be calculated\nusing the Bethe-Bloch equation. \u00bfFrom the average momentum of the remnants, we conclude that 50% of the\nremnants will have velocities \u03b2 \u2264 0.3. I.e. these remnants can be decelerated in matter e.g. in an iron block\nof 8 cm (\u03b2 = 0.1), 1.3 m (\u03b2 = 0.2) or 6.4 m (\u03b2 = 0.3)\nlength. This method would allow to include even high\nmomentum remnants into the trapping process.\nThus, these approaches indicates the possibility to accumulate separated BH + and BH \u2212 over a long period\nof time.\nIn a second stage, the BH + s can be merged with\nthe BH \u2212 s which increases the horizon in the process\nBH + + BH \u2212 \u2192 BH 0 . During this process, the charge\nof the forming black hole is neutralized and the mass is\nincreased to 2MR . This will make a new evaporation possible which can then be analyzed in an environment clean\nof background from the proton-proton collision. In particular, the characteristics of the late stages of the decay\ncan be observed closely.\nAfter the merged black holes have shrunk again to remnant mass, most of them will be neutral and escape the\nexperimentally accessible region due to their small cross\nsection.\nFigure 2 to 5 show results from a simulation of such reactions for a sample of 106 events of BH + +BH \u2212 \u2192 BH 0\nwith CHARYBDIS modified to incorporate the remnant\nproduction according to [33]. Here, we have assumed that\nthe black holes have been slowed down enough to make\nthe initial momentum negligible. The total energy of the\ncollision is then 2 \u00d7 MR . Figure 2 and 3 show the total\nmultiplicity of the events after fragmentation, Figures 4\nand 5 show the pT - spectra for \u03b3's as an example . The\nspectra are free from low energetic debris present in P P\ncollisions arising from the presence of spectators.\nEven though the parameter of the model might be difficult to extract (the dependence on d and Mf would require initial states of varying masses) a measurement of\nsuch spectrum would be a very important input to examine the signatures from the P P collision at the LHC. In\nsuch a way, the remnants would allow to extract the properties of the black hole's decay and remove theoretical\nuncertainties by allowing to quantify them directly from\nexperimental measurements. This would substantially\nincrease the precision by which the parameters of the\nunderlying extra-dimensional model can be determined.\n\ntion. Unfortunately, the lower cyclotron frequency of the\nheavy (thus slow) remnants makes this cooling mechanism less efficient for black hole remnants. However, they\ncan be cooled indirectly by Coulomb interaction with the\npositrons or electrons.\n\n0.06\nMf=1 TeV\nMf=2 TeV\n\nd=4\nMR=3 TeV\n\n0.05\n\nn\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nMultiplicity\nFIG. 2.

CONCLUSION\n\nREFERENCES\n\nIn the scenario of large extra dimensions, the formation\nof black hole remnants in high energy collisions is possible. We have computed the fraction of charged black\nhole remnants. With use of the PYTHIA event generator we found that about 23.5% of the remnants carry\ncharge +1 and 17.7% carry charge \u22121. Due to their electromagnetic interaction, we have argued that the black\nhole remnants can be trapped and then could be used to\nexamine the evaporation characteristics. In this case, the\nabsence of background from the collision region and the\ncontrolled initial state would allow to obtain very clean\nsignals. This would make it possible to extract information about the late stages of the evaporation process of\nblack holes with unprecedented precision.\n\n[1] I. Antoniadis, Phys. Lett.
