The photonic\ncontribution (photon conversions and Dalitz decays) is subtracted from the inclusive\nspectra resulting in non-photonic single electron spectra.

The\nimplications for heavy flavor production in hot and cold nuclear systems are discussed.\n\n1. Introduction\nHeavy flavor production in nuclear systems has utility as a probe of both cold nuclear\nmatter effects and of more exotic effects associated with the hot partonic state formed in\nthe aftermath of high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Differences in the relative yield\nof heavy flavor in p \u2212 p and p \u2212 A collision probes nuclear modifications of the gluon\ndistribution function and energy loss in a cold nuclear medium. Strong suppression of\nhigh pT hadrons of light quark flavor at moderate to high transverse momentum has\nbeen observed at RHIC [1]. Medium induced gluon radiation, which is considered as\nthe main cause of the high pT suppression, may be reduced for heavy quarks [2] [3].\n2. Data Analysis and Results\nPHENIX measures non-photonic electron spectra by first measuring the inclusive\nelectron spectra and then subracting the contribution from photonic sources. The\nprincipal contributors to the photonic electrons are Dalitz decays of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons and\nphoton conversions, and the dominant contributor to the non-photonic electrons is heavy\nquark decay. Other non-photonics contributors that enter at the percent level are light\nvector meson di-electron decay and Ke3 . The inclusive electron spectra are measured\nwith a combination of detectors in the PHENIX central arm spectrometers (|\u03b7| < 0.35\nin pseudorapidity) which is described in detail elsewhere [4].

The data have been corrected\nfor acceptance and reconstruction efficiency, and the photonic background has been\nsubtracted using a cocktail method that is described in detail elsewhere [5]. Fig. 1\nshows the spectrum of non-photonic electrons from p \u2212 p collisions. A fit to the\ndata is shown as the solid line. The right panel shows the total charm cross section\ndetermined by allowing PYTHIA lineshapes for electrons from charm and bottom\nmeson decay to assume normalizations that best fit the data. The systematic error\nwas calculated by offseting the data by the systematic errors and repeating the fit\nproceedure. The total charm cross section derived using this extrapolation technique is\n\u03c3cc = 709\u03bcb \u00b1 [85]stat \u00b1 [332\n281 ]sys .\nThe method by which electrons from photonic sources were subtracted in the\nanalysis of the d \u2212 Au data from Run 3 at RHIC was the so-called converter subtraction\nmethod. During a fraction of the running period a photon converter of known mass was\ninserted close to the interaction point. By measuring the electron yield with and without\nthe converter it is possible to infer the fraction of measured electrons from photonic\nsources. The preliminary analysis of the d \u2212 Au data used a converter run sample that\nconsisted of 5M min-bias events and the equivalent of 312M min-bias events sampled\nby the ERT trigger. The non-converter dataset included 5M min-bias and 600M trigger\nsampled min-bias events.

The solid line is the best fit to p \u2212 p data.\nThe analysis of Au \u2212 Au collision data for single electrons also employed the\nconverter subtraction method.

Conclusion\nWithin errors, the d \u2212 Au non-photonic single electron spectra are in good agreement with the p \u2212 p spectra in all centrality classes. This is indicative of no strong\nmodification to the initial state gluon distribution function in the x range relevant\nto heavy quark production at central rapidity (10\u22122 < x < 10\u22121 ). The integrated\ndN/dy in Au \u2212 Au collisions is consistent with a binary scaling hypothesis, indicating no strong charm enhancement or suppression in heavy ion collisions. No\nconclusion can be drawn with regards to a modification of the spectra shapes in\nAu \u2212 Au collision, as to whether it follows pQCD, exhibits significant charm quark\nenergy loss, or follows hydrodynamic flow. Measuring v2 of charm was proposed [6]\nas a potential way to disambiguate these very different dynamical scenarios. Figure 4 shows the preliminary measurment of non-photonic single electron flow in\nAu \u2212 Au collision. The current Au \u2212 Au run at RHIC will provide the necessary\nstatistics to investigate both heavy quark energy loss and non-photonic electron flow.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nS. S.
