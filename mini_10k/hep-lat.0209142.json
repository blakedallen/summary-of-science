The qualitative behaviour of the pion mass and coupling at small quark masses is\ndiscussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe eightfold way of hadron spectra is the consequence of the SU(3) flavour\nsymmetry in QCD which follows from the existence of three light quarks\n(u, d and s). Numerical simulations of QCD have to take into account this\nbasic fact. The \"quenched approximation\", which corresponds to the limit\nof infinitely heavy virtual quarks, is not reliable because of its unknown\nsystematic errors (see, for instance, [1, 2]).\nChiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [3] is very useful for extrapolating\nthe results of numerical simulations to the small u- and d-quark masses but,\n\u2217\n\nContribution by I. Montvay to QUARKS'2002, Novgorod, Russia, June 2002\n\n1\n\n\fof course, it has a finite range of applicability. In practice this means that\none has to stay in a region where the one-loop ChPT formulas give a good\napproximation. For investigating the masses and couplings of pseudoscalar\nmesons one should reach the quark mass range below about one quarter of the\nstrange quark mass (mud \u2264 14 ms ) [4, 5]. Present large scale QCD simulations\n\u2013 especially with Wilson-type quark actions \u2013 are not yet at small enough\nquark masses for the applicability of chiral perturbation theory. This is\nclearly displayed, for instance, by the absence of curvature (\"no chiral logs\")\nin the present data about the dependence of m2\u03c0 and f\u03c0 versus the quark\nmass mq (see, for instance, [6, 7, 8, 9]).\nGoing to light quark masses in unquenched QCD simulations is a great\nchallenge for computations because known algorithms have a substantial\nslowing down towards small quark masses. The present status has been\nsummarized by the contributors to the panel discussion at the Berlin lattice\nconference [10]. In these contributions the computational costs were established at relatively large quark masses and extrapolated into the interesting\nrange of small quark masses. Recent developments show, however, that at\nsmall quark masses new difficulties appear which might invalidate this extrapolation [11, 12]. This was the motivation of our collaboration to investigate\nin a series of algorithmic studies the computational cost of numerical simulations down to about one fifth of the strange quark mass (mud \u2264 15 ms )\n[13, 14]. In our tests we used the two-step multi-boson algorithm [15].\n\n2\n\nCost estimates\n\nThe computational cost of obtaining a new, independent gauge configuration\nin an updating sequence with dynamical quarks can be parametrized, for\ninstance, as\n\u0012 \u0013zL \u0012 \u0013za\nr0\n\u2212z\u03c0 L\nC = F (r0 m\u03c0 )\n.\n(1)\na\na\nHere r0 is the Sommer scale parameter, m\u03c0 the pion mass, L the lattice\nextension and a the lattice spacing. The powers z\u03c0,L,a and the overall constant\nF are empirically determined.\nIn order to limit the necessary computer time our collaboration first performed high statistics simulations with Nf = 2 degenerate quark flavours on\ncoarse lattices (83 * 16) with a lattice spacing a \u2243 0.27 fm. (a is determined\nby r0 \u2243 0.5 fm from the mesured value of r0 /a.) This gives for the space2\n\n\fQuark mass dependence of plaquette autocorrelations\n100\n\nfit: c*xz\nc = 7.92(68)\nz = -2.02(10)\n\u03c72/ndf = 1.8\n\n\u03c4int\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n1 M = (r m )2\nr\n0 \u03c0\n\n10\n\nFigure 1: Power fit of the plaquette autocorrelation given in units of 106 *\nMVM as a function of the dimensionless quark mass parameter Mr .

For the definition of the quark mass\nthe dimensionless quantity\nMr \u2261 (r0 m\u03c0 )2\n\n(2)\n\nhas been used, which already appears in (1). In this variable the strange\nquark mass can be defined as Mr,strange \u2261 3.1.\nOur results for the integrated autocorrelations of different physical quantities (\u03c4int ) have been described in detail in [13]. For illustration see figures\nplaquette\nm\u03c0\nare shown,\n1 and 2 where the quark mass dependence of \u03c4int\nand \u03c4int\n6\ntogether with power fits. The units for the costs are 10 fermion-matrixvector-multiplications (MVMs). Comparing the two figures one sees that the\n\"cost\" for m\u03c0 is substantially less than the one for the average plaquette.\nThe fitted powers of the quark mass are also different. In the notation of the\n3\n\n\fQuark mass dependence of pion mass autocorrelations\nfit: c*xz\nc = 1.99(16)\nz = -1.47(16)\n\u03c72/ndf = 1.7\n\n\u03c4int\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n1 M = (r m )2\nr\n0 \u03c0\n\n10\n\nFigure 2: Power fit of the autocorrelation of the pion mass given in units\nof 106 * MVM as a function of the dimensionless quark mass parameter Mr .\nThe best fit of the form cMrz is at c = 1.99(16), z = \u22121.47(16).\nplaquette\nm\u03c0\nis consistent with z\u03c0 \u2243 3.\nformula in (1) \u03c4int\ngives z\u03c0 \u2243 4, whereas \u03c4int\nThe pion coupling constant f\u03c0 , which is related to the constant in front of\nthe pion contribution in the pseudoscalar propagator, has even shorter autocorrelations than m\u03c0 . This is obviously rather advantageous for obtaining\nphysical information from the quark mass dependence of the pion mass and\ncoupling (see [4]).\nOur collaboration also studied the volume dependence of the cost by\nchoosing a few 83 *16 runs and repeating them on either 164 or 123 *24 lattices,\nwithout changing other parameters [14]. The parameters of the chosen points\nare collected in table 1 and some results are shown in table 2. The error\nanalysis and integrated autocorrelations in the runs on the larger lattices have\nbeen obtained using the linearization method of the ALPHA collaboration\n[16]. The conclusion from these tests is that the cost increase with the lattice\nvolume is quite acceptable because it is close to the trivial volume factor.

This is partly due to the intrinsic fluctuation present\nin the pion propagator which is originated from the freedom of randomly\nchoosing the position of the source.\n\n3\n\nChiral logs?\n\nThe behaviour of physical quantities, as for instance the pseudoscalar meson\n(\"pion\") mass m\u03c0 or pseudoscalar decay constant f\u03c0 as a function of the\nquark mass are characterized by the appearance of chiral logarithms. These\nchiral logs, which are due to virtual pseudoscalar meson loops, have a nonanalytic behaviour near zero quark mass of a generic form mq log mq . They\nimply relatively fast changes of certain quantities near zero quark mass which\nare not seen in present data [6, 7, 8, 9, 12].\nIn our range of quark masses (mq \u2243 15 ms ) the logarithmic curvature\ndue to chiral logs has to appear, at least in the continuum limit. Although\nwe have rather coarse lattices (a \u2243 0.27 fm) and, in addition, up to now\nwe are working with unrenormalized quantities \u2013 without the Z-factors of\nmultiplicative renormalization \u2013 it is interesting to see whether the effects of\nchiral logs can already be seen in our data.\nLet us recall the one-loop ChPT formulas for m2\u03c0 :\nMr\nMr Br0\n(\u039b3 r0 )2\n= Br0 \u2212\nlog\n+ O(Mr2 ) ,\n2\u03bcr\n16\u03c0 2 (f r0 )2\nMr\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\fTable 2: Results from the runs with parameters shown in table 1.

Besides Mr defined in (1), the quark mass defined by\nthe PCAC relation mPq CAC also appears in the dimensionless combination\n\u03bcr \u2261 mPq CAC r0 .\n\n(5)\n\n(For the definition of mPq CAC see, for instance, the equations (20)-(23) in our\npaper [13].) The dimensionless parameters Br0 , f r0 and \u039b3 r0 in (3) and f r0\nand \u039b4 r0 in (4) have to be fitted to the data.\nThe data from table 3 of ref. [13] and the one-loop ChPT fits are shown\nin figures 3 and 4. (The runs with label (c) and (d), which have low statistics\nand hence large statistical errors, are omitted here.) In both figures two fits\nare shown: one taking into account all points and another one where the\npoints above Mr = 2 are omitted. As the figures show, the data in the small\nquark mass range clearly show the expected qualitative behaviour with chiral\nlogs. The fit parameters have reasonable values, similar to the ones deduced\nin [5] from previous lattice data at larger quark masses [6, 7]. For instance,\nthe fits with all points correspond to the parameters: Br0 = 8.2, f r0 = 0.27,\n\u039b3 r0 = 3.5 in formula (3) and f r0 = 0.60, \u039b4 r0 = 4.3 in formula (4).\n6\n\n\f3\n\nTest of \u03c7PT logarithms on 8 \u00d716\n\nfit to all points\nskipped two heaviest points\n8\n\n7\nMr/(2\u03bcr)\n\n6\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nMr\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 3: Fits of the pseudoscalar meson mass-squared with the one-loop\nChPT formula.\n\nThe fact that our data in the small quark mass range 15 ms \u2264 mq \u2264 32 ms\nshow the expected logarithmic behaviour of chiral perturbation theory is\nquite satisfactory.

A significant number of configurations with\nnegative determinant would be a serious obstacle for performing numerical\nsimulations with and odd number of flavours \u2013 as it occurs with u-, d- and\ns-quarks in nature. The results of our collaboration show [13, 14] that in\nthe investigated range of quark masses no sign problem occurs because the\nstatistical weight of configurations with negative determinant is negligible\neven at our smallest quark masses.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion and outlook\n\nOur cost estimates for numerical simulations of QCD with light dynamical\nWilson-quarks \u2013 as a function of the quark mass and volume \u2013 allow a reasonably precise prediction of the computational costs for future simulations.\nUp to now we did not yet perform a systematic investigation of the slowing down with decreasing lattice spacing, expressed by the power za in (1),\nbut previous experience in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [18, 19] at\nsmall lattice spacings a \u2243 0.06 fm and our preliminary results in QCD near\na \u2243 0.17 fm are consistent with the expected behaviour za = 2 [10].\nAssuming za = 2 and starting from the results of runs (h) and (h16) in\ntable 2 one can deduce the following estimates for obtaining 100 independent\ngauge configurations:\n\u2022 On a 243 * 48 lattice with lattice spacing a = 0.125 fm at quark mass parameter Mr = 0.8 corresponding to mud \u2243 41 ms and physical extension\ncharacterized by Lm\u03c0 \u2243 6 the cost would be C \u2243 9 * 1016 \u2212 3 * 1018 flop,\nplaq\nm\u03c0\nor \u03c4int\nas relevant.\ndepending on whether one considers \u03c4int\n\u2022 Similarly, on a 323 * 64 lattice with lattice spacing a = 0.06 fm at the\nsame quark mass and Lm\u03c0 \u2243 4 the cost would be C \u2243 6 * 1017 \u2212 4 *\n1019 flop.\nCompared to most of the estimates in [10] these numbers are lower. Note that\nthe costs for parameter tuning and equilibration \u2013 which are not negligible\n\u2013 are not included in these estimates. Nevertheless, the necessary order of\nmagnitude of CPU times for these kinds of calculations is expected to be\navailable for the lattice community in forthcoming years.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
