Introduction and summary\nDifferent phases of non-Abelian gauge field theories are already manifest in the Standard\nmodel of elementary particle interactions, and charting the phase structure of these theories\nas, for example, numbers of colours and quark flavours are varied is important for model\nbuilding beyond the Standard model, see e.g. [1]. In this regard, an especially interesting\nclass of theories are quantum field theories with nontrivial infrared fixed points of the \u03b2function. This means that while the coupling runs when probed at very short distances,\nit becomes a constant over some energy range in the infrared and the theory appears\nconformal. One of the phenomenological connections to these theories was provided in\n[2] where the possibility of a fully conformal sector coupled only weakly to the Standard\nModel through effective operators at low energies was considered. Conformal symmetry\ndetermines the mass dimensions of these operators which have some striking implications\nfor the related low energy observables [3]. Various further phenomenological and theoretical\naspects of these unparticles have been investigated, see e.g. [4].\nAnother phenomenological motivation to study theories which either feature an infrared fixed point or are, in theory space, close to one which does, originates from technicolor (TC) and the associated extended technicolor (ETC) models. These models were\ndevised a long time ago to explain the mass patterns of the Standard Model gauge bosons\nand fundamental fermions without the need to introduce a fundamental scalar particle\n[5, 6, 7]. The Higgs sector in these theories consists of a new fermion species (techniquarks), charged under a new gauge interaction (technicolor). Early TC models, based on\na technicolor sector straightforwardly extrapolated from a QCD-like strongly interacting\ntheory, had several problems. These include flavour changing neutral currents due to the\nextended technicolor interactions and unwanted additional light pseudo-Goldstone bosons\ndue to the breaking of the chiral symmetry of the techniquarks. It has been known for some\ntime that these problems are solved in so called walking technicolor theories [8, 9, 10]. These\ntheories are nearly conformal, i.e. the evolution of the coupling constant is, in a wide range\nof energy, governed by an attractive quasi-stable infrared fixed point at strong coupling.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fSeveral possible generic forms of a \u03b2-function are sketched in Fig. 1. The form of the\nfull nonperturbative \u03b2-function of a non-supersymmetric SU(N ) gauge field theory remains\nunknown to date1 . Nevertheless, we can discuss the features shown in Fig. 1 by considering\nthe perturbative \u03b2-function for SU(N ) gauge field theory with fermions, defined up to two\nloop order as\ng3\ng5\n\u03b2(g) = \u2212\u03b20\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n,\n(1.1)\n1\n16\u03c0 2\n(16\u03c0 2 )2\nwhere the coefficients are\n4\n11\nC2 (G) \u2212 T (R)Nf ,\n3\n3\n34\n20\n2\n\u03b21 = C2 (G) \u2212 C2 (G)T (R)Nf \u2212 4C2 (R)T (R)Nf ,\n3\n3\n\u03b20 =\n\nand C2 (R) is the second Casimir invariant for SU(N ) representation R and \u03b4ab T (R) =\ntr(TRa TRb ). As is well known for QCD, for modest amount of matter in the fundamental representation there is not enough screening to compensate for the antiscreening contribution\nof the gluons and \u03b2(g) < 0, which guarantees asymptotic freedom. Perturbative \u03b2-function\nbecomes zero only in the ultraviolet fixed point at g = 0. However, imagine adding enough\nmatter in the fundamental representation to make \u03b20 small and positive, while \u03b21 becomes\nnegative. Then there appears a nontrivial zero, \u03b2(g\u2217 ) = 0 at g\u22172 = \u221216\u03c0 2 \u03b20 /\u03b21 , and the\n\u03b2-function is of the form shown by the dashed-dotted curve in Fig. 1. This zero corresponds\nto an attractive infrared fixed point. If approached from the asymptotically free side the\ntheory becomes conformal, very unlike QCD, when long-wavelength probes are considered.\nIf g\u2217 is small, perturbative analysis can be applied [12]. However, it is more likely that\nsuch infrared fixed points do not appear at perturbative values of the coupling and one has\nto account for full nonperturbative dynamics of non-abelian gauge theories. This can lead\nto the walking dynamics.\nNamely, one has to take into account the formation of quark-antiquark condensate\nleading to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which decouples the quarks from\ninfrared dynamics and keeps the \u03b2-function negative. Therefore the \u03b2-function never actually reaches the would-be infrared fixed point, but the very close proximity to it allows\nthe coupling to \"walk\" slowly over a wide range of scales. Eventually the \u03b2-function is\nrepelled from the proximity of the fixed point and behaves as in a generic asymptotically\nfree theory, see Fig. 1. Another way to destabilize the infrared fixed point is to add small\nexplicit chiral symmetry breaking, e.g. a mass term for the fermions.\nTherefore, there is need for concrete examples of theories with infrared stable fixed\npoints but not many concrete examples are currently known. For example N = 4 SYM\nprovides a concrete realization of a theory where the \u03b2-function vanishes identically as\nwas first shown on the two loop level in [13], and later to all orders in [14]. This theory,\nhowever, is conformal at all scales and not just in the infrared. Supersymmetry provides\nenough structure to allow for nonperturbative analysis and construction of theories which\nfeature an infrared stable fixed point at which the \u03b2-function becomes zero and the running\n1\n\nHowever, for a recent conjecture about its possible form, see [11]\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f\u03b2\n\nIR fixed point\n\nwalking\n\ng2\n\nQCD\u2212like\n\nFigure 1: The schematic \u03b2-function of a theory with an infrared fixed point (dash-dotted line,\ntop), walking coupling (solid line, middle) and QCD-like running coupling (dashed line, below).\n\ncoupling freezes to a constant value. Beyond supersymmetric cases [15], little is known in\nfull quantitative detail, and the reason is that this requires nonperturbative knowledge\nwhich to date can only be obtained on the lattice.\nOn the other hand, analytic semi-quantitative studies of conformal windows have been\nable to single out some viable candidates which should be studied in more detail using\nlattice methods. In particular, for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with higher\nfermion representations it has been suggested [16] that an ideal candidate for minimal\nwalking technicolor theory would be the one with just two (techni)quark flavours in twoindex symmetric representation of SU(2) or SU(3). Initial studies of these theories have\nbeen performed on the lattice already [17, 18, 19]. For a related study of a QCD-like theory\nwith fundamental representation fermions see [20].\nIn this paper we consider the case of SU(2) gauge fields with two fermions in the\ntwo-index symmetric representation, which, for SU(2), is equivalent to the adjoint representation. We measure various correlators as functions of the fermion mass and lattice\ncoupling in order to obtain information on the spectrum of (techni)color singlet states of\nthis theory.\nNaturally, the most direct way to answer the question concerning the conformal behaviour of the coupling constant in this theory would be to directly measure the evolution\nof the coupling constant. Although this can be implemented on the lattice straightforwardly, using e.g. the Schr\u00f6dinger functional method, care is needed in the interpretation\nof the results. However, even without direct knowledge of the behaviour of the coupling\nconstant one can learn about the possible conformal behaviour through other observables.\nIn the conformal theory, no massive bound states can exist, since the existence of a mass\nscale immediately implies breaking of the conformal invariance. Hence, the spectrum of\ncolor singlet states should provide first hints of the possible underlying conformal invariance. Furthermore, regarding the possible conformal or walking behaviour it is important\nto understand the onset of chiral symmetry breaking in these theories. To complement the\ninitial studies [17], we present our high-precision results concerning the spectrum of the\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fcolor singlet states in the SU(2) gauge theory with two adjoint fermion flavours and discuss\nthe implications this will have on the possible conformal (or walking) behaviour. We will\nshow that while our results seem consistent with near conformal behaviour, the definite\nanswer to this question can only be provided in a further study.\nThe paper is structured so that in sec. 2 we recall the basics of the model as well as\nof the lattice formulation we use, in sec. 3 we present our results and interpretation of the\ndata and in sec. 4 we conclude and outline the directions of our future work.\n\n2. The model and lattice formulation\nThe minimal model to be studied here consists of the gauge dynamics of two Dirac fermions\nin the adjoint representation of the SU(2) gauge theory. This model has been proposed to\nbe (quasi)conformal with only two flavours of massless technifermions.\nThe continuum theory is defined by:\n1\n/ + d Dd\n/\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + u Du\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd is the usual SU(2) field strength, and the gauge covariant derivative is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[D\u03bc u]a = \u2202\u03bc \u03b4ac \u2212 igTC Ab\u03bc \u01ebabc uc ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere a = 1, 2, 3.\nDue to the pseudoreality of the SU(2) representations, the global symmetry group\nof the above theory is SU(4), which breaks to SO(4) due to a formation of the fermion\ncondensate huu + ddi. This pattern leads to the appearance of nine Goldstone bosons.\nIf the above theory is taken to drive the electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e. coupled to\nthe electroweak SUL (2)\u00d7UY (1) gauge fields, three of these Goldstones will become the\nlongitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons, and the physical low energy spectrum\nis expected to contain six Goldstone bosons and these are furthermore expected to receive\nmasses of the order of the electroweak scale through, e.g. ETC interactions. Here we are\ninterested of the strong coupling properties of the SU(2) gauge theory and do not consider\nthe coupling to the electroweak.\nWe will study the masses of several (techni)color neutral states. In the adjoint theory\nthe spectrum is much richer than if fundamental representation fermions are considered.\nBecause the technigluons, quarks and antiquarks all transform in the same representation,\nwe can obtain gauge singlet states by combining two or more of any of the fields above.\nThe simplest to measure are meson-like states consisting of two quarks or a quark and an\nantiquark. The three quark color neutral states can be constructed in analogy to baryons of\nordinary QCD, e.g. \"proton\" (spin-1/2) and \"delta\" (spin-3/2). Finally there are possible\nexotic states like the color neutral combination of a techniquark and technigluon.\nOn the lattice the action is\nSlat = SG + SF ,\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwith the standard Wilson plaquette action\nSG = \u03b2L\n\nX \u0014\n\nx;\u03bc<\u03bd\n\n\u0015\n1\n1 \u2212 TrPx;\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere P\u03bc\u03bd is the standard 1 \u00d7 1 plaquette, written in terms of the SU(2) fundamental\nrepresentation link matrices U\u03bc (x). The Wilson fermion action, SF , for two (degenerate)\nDirac fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group is\nX X\n\u03c8\u0304f,x Mxy \u03c8f,y ,\n(2.5)\nSF =\nf =u,d x,y\n\nwhere\nMxy = \u03b4xy \u2212 \u03ba\n\nX\u0002\n\u03bc\n\n\u0003\nT\n(1 + \u03b3\u03bc )Vx,\u03bc + (1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc )Vx\u2212\u03bc,\u03bc\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe only modification to the usual Wilson action for fundamental fermions is the replacement of the link variables U\u03bc (x) with the variables\nV\u03bcab (x) = 2tr(S a U\u03bc (x)S b U\u03bc\u2020 (x)),\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere S a a = 1, 2, 3 are the generators of the fundamental representation, normalised as\nTrS a S b = 12 \u03b4ab . The elements of V -matrices are real and V \u22121 = V T . We note that\nbecause the link matrices are real, it would be possible to perform lattice simulations with\ntwo Dirac flavours of staggered fermions without encountering the square root problem (for\nan example, see [21]).\n2\nThe lattice action is parametrised with two dimensionless parameters, \u03b2L = 4/gbare\nand \u03ba = 1/[8 + 2(amq,bare )]. The parameter \u03ba is related to the quark mass. Because the\nWilson fermion action breaks the chiral symmetry of the (massless) continuum theory, the\nbare quark mass receives large additive corrections, and we cannot avoid the inclusion of\nthe mass term in the lattice action. The physical (PCAC) quark mass is defined through\nthe flavour non-diagonal axial Ward identity\n1 \u2202t VAP\n,\nt\u2192\u221e 2 VPP\n\nmQ = lim\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar and axial-pseudoscalar currents are as follows:\nX\nVPP (t) =\nhd\u0304(x, t)\u03b35 u(x, t)d\u0304(y, 0)\u03b35 d(0, 0)i\n(2.9)\nx,y\n\nX\nVAP (t) =\nhd\u0304(x, t)\u03b30 \u03b35 d(x, t)d\u0304(y, 0)\u03b35 d(0, 0)i.\n\n(2.10)\n\nx,y\n\nHere and below we use wall sources with Coulomb gauge fixing in all our hadronic correlation functions. For each \u03b2L the value of the hopping parameter \u03ba where mQ vanishes\ndefines the critical hopping parameter \u03bac (\u03b2L ). In practice we use a few t-values around\nt = Lt /2 for the fit in Eq. (2.8).\nThe Wilson quark action (2.5) has O(a) discretisation errors, which could be eliminated by employing the O(a) improved \"clover\" action. However, to fully implement O(a)\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fimprovement would substantially increase the complexity of the simulation program and\nrequire careful renormalisation of various quantities. Thus, the lowest-order accuracy is\njustified in exploratory investigation as is the case here. The simulations are performed\nwith the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, using even-odd preconditioned quark matrix and\nleapfrog integrator. The quark matrix is inverted using the standard conjugate gradient\nmethod.\nThe masses of colour singlet \"hadrons\" are estimated by fits to the time sliced averaged\ncorrelation functions with Coulomb gauge fixed wall sources. We concentrate only on\nflavour non-diagonal (isospin non-singlet) operators. For example, the correlation function\nfor quark-antiquark states, \"mesons,\" is given by\nX\nGX (t) =\nh\u016b(x, t)\u0393X d(x, t)d\u0304(y, 0)\u0393X u(0, 0)i,\n(2.11)\nx,y\n\nwhere \u0393X = \u03b35 for the pseudoscalar and \u0393X = \u03b3i , i = 1, 2, 3 for the vector meson. We\nalso measured scalar (\u0393X = 1) and axial vector (\u0393X = \u03b35 \u03b3i ) correlators, but for these\nthe statistical errors remain too large for reliable results. Except for the isosinglet channel,\nstates consisting of two quarks are degenerate with the quark-antiquark states in Eq. (2.11).\nThe correlation functions for three quark states, spin-1/2 \"proton\" and spin-3/2 \"\u2206\",\nare constructed in analogous fashion to standard SU(3) QCD. We also made an attempt\nto measure the correlation function of the colour singlet quark-gluon state; however, we\ndid not succeed in constructing a source operator without excessive statistical noise for\nmeasuring the mass.\n\n3. Results\nThe simulations were carried out with five different values of \u03b2L = 1.3, 1.7, 1.9, 2.2 and\n2.5. For each value of \u03b2L we used 5 to 11 different values of \u03ba, corresponding to different\nquark masses, with volumes 244 and 324 . In addition, we made exploratory runs with\nvolumes 84 and 104 , but we did not use these volumes for spectroscopy. For each case\nthe number of hybrid Monte Carlo trajectories was 100-700. The evolution timestep \u2206\u03c4\nwas 0.02 for larger values of the quark mass and was decreased to 0.003 closer to the zero\nmass limit. The number of integration steps Ns was chosen so that the trajectory length\nNs \u00d7 \u03b4\u03c4 \u223c O(1). For comparison we also performed simulations with SU(2) gauge group\nand two flavours of fundamental representation quarks, using \u03b2L = 1.7 and 2.5. Some of\nthe early results of this study have appeared in [22].\nAs briefly discussed in the introduction, we are investigating how the phenomena of\nchiral symmetry in the continuum emerge from the lattice which has no such symmetry to\nbegin with. The standard way is to study the critical line \u03bac (\u03b2L ), defined as the line where\nthe quark mass (as defined in Eq. (2.8)) vanishes. If there is chiral symmetry breaking,\nalong this line the pseudoscalar \"pions\" become massless Goldstone bosons, whereas other\n\u221a\nhadrons remain massive. If mQ > 0 (\u03ba < \u03bac (\u03b2)), the mass of the pseudoscalars is \u221d mQ .\nLocating this critical line allows us to sketch a possible phase diagram of the lattice theory.\nHowever, in practice the simulations become progressively more difficult the smaller\nthe quark mass is. This is due to the appearance of very small eigenvalues of the fermion\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fSU(2)-adjoint\n\nSU(2)-fundamental\n\n0.7\n\u03b2L=1.3\n\u03b2L=1.7\n\u03b2L=1.9\n\u03b2L=2.2\n\u03b2L=2.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\nplaquette\n\nplaquette\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b2L=1.3\n\u03b2L=1.7\n\u03b2L=2.5\n\n0.15\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: The plaquette expectation value at fixed values of the lattice coupling\n2\n\u03b2L = 4/gbare\nas functions of the hopping parameter \u03ba for the theory with adjoint representation\nfermions.

This becomes more\nsevere in large volumes. In order to better understand the phase diagram, we performed a\nset of simulations on a relatively small 104 lattice. In the left panel of Fig. 2 we show the\nresults for the measurement of the plaquette expectation value as a function of \u03ba at fixed\n2\nin SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint fermions. The results\nlattice coupling \u03b2L = 4/gbare\nshow clear signs of a discontinuity for values of \u03b2L smaller than \u03b2L,c \u223c 2, while at larger\ncouplings we obtain a smooth curve. Even with this volume it turns out to be very difficult\nto make simulations at very close proximity to the jump. On the other hand, at larger\nvalues of \u03b2L it is possible to do simulations at all values of \u03ba. We take this to be an\nindication of a first order phase transition for \u03b2L < \u03b2L,c \u223c 2, at which point there possibly\nis a critical point where the transition ends. Signs of this kind of behaviour were also seen\nin [18].\nThis observation can be contrasted with the case of fundamental representation fermions:\nwe have performed the measurements for the same range of \u03b2L in the case of fundamental\nfermions and the results are shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. In comparison with adjoint\nfermions, we find considerably smaller discontinuity (or possibly no discontinuity at all) at\nsmall values of \u03b2L . We note that a first order phase transition at small values of the lattice\ncoupling \u03b2L has also been seen in standard SU(3) lattice QCD with Wilson fermions; for\na recent review, see [23]. These first order transitions are lattice artifacts, not present in\nthe continuum theory.\nWe measure the quark masses and the hadron spectroscopy from larger lattice volumes,\n244 or in some cases 324 . In left and right panels of Fig. 3 we show mQ , measured using\nEq. (2.8), as functions of the hopping parameter \u03ba for different values of \u03b2L for the adjoint\nrepresentation quarks and for the fundamental representation quarks, respectively.

Right panel: Same as left but for fundamental\nrepresentation fermions.\n\nadjoint representation, at small \u03b2L <\n\u223c 1.9 we are not able to reach very small quark masses,\nbecause the first order phase transition in left panel of Fig. 2 occurs at \u03ba-values which\ncorrespond to non-zero quark masses2 At this point the measured PCAC quark masses\nabruptly jump to negative values (measured from smaller volumes; not shown on the plot).\nThis behaviour has been observed to happen also in standard SU(3) lattice QCD with\nWilson quarks [23]. On the other hand, at larger \u03b2L we observe no particular problems in\nsimulating with \u03ba-values corresponding even to negative quark masses. Naturally, simulations at very small quark masses still require very short update step in HMC trajectories.\nWe observe qualitatively similar behaviour for fundamental representation quarks.\nWe are now in position to sketch the phase diagram for the adjoint theory in Fig. 3.\nThe critical line \u03bac (\u03b2L ) is defined as the line where the quark mass vanishes. In the weak\ncoupling limit \u03b2L = 0 it has the value \u03ba = 1/4 and extends towards \u03ba = 1/8 at \u03b2L = \u221e. In\nthe small-\u03b2L -region, where the first order transition prevents us from reaching very small\nquark masses, we nevertheless extrapolate its location. (This is done only for illustration;\nwe do not need it in subsequent analysis.) The first order line appears to terminate at\na critical point roughly at \u03b2L,c \u223c 2, above which the behaviour appears to be regular\nas mQ = 0 -limit is passed. The location of this critical point is conjectural; we cannot\nnumerically exclude a very weak first order transition extending to much higher values of\n\u03b2L , possibly to infinity. However, the abruptness with which the discontinuity vanishes in\nour simulations may suggest the existence of a genuine critical point. We remind that the\ntheory is asymptotically free, thus, the lattice continuum limit is at \u03b2L \u2192 \u221e, unless there\nexists a critical point at finite \u03b2L leading to non-trivial infrared physics.\n2\n\nHowever, note that at \u03b2L = 1.3 we are able to reach \u03ba = 0.235, which is substantially beyond the\nlocation of the transition at \u03ba \u2248 0.22. This is presumably due to the large metastability of the first order\ntransition at large volume.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fAoki phase\n\u03b2=0\n0.25\nmq = 0\n\u03ba 0.2\n\n0.15\n\n1st order\n\nmq > 0\n\u03b2 = infinity\n\n0.1\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b2L\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 4: The phase diagram on (\u03b2L , \u03ba) -plane for the adjoint theory. Solid circles denote the\nmeasured (and extrapolated for \u03b2L \u2264 1.9) critical hopping parameters \u03bac (\u03b2L ), where mQ = 0. At\n\u03b2L <\n\u223c 2 there appears a 1st order phase transition, which ends at a critical point shown by open\nsquare. The phase structure above the critical line is a conjecture, and it can be more complex\nthan shown here. The Aoki phase may exist also for values larger than \u03b2L \u223c 2.\n\nWe conjecture that the first order transition leads into so-called Aoki phase, which is\na strong lattice coupling artifact for Wilson fermions [24, 25, 26]. In this phase flavour\nsymmetry and parity are spontaneously broken. Our observations confirm the behaviour\nestablished in the earlier studies at smaller volumes [18]. We note that the lattice phase\ndiagram of the theory with fundamental SU(2) representation quarks is expected to have\nsimilar features to the adjoint quark one, with the possible exception of the missing first\norder transition at small \u03b2L .\nWith these results in mind, let us now consider the measurements of the mass spectrum\nand their implications. In Fig. 3 we show the pseudoscalar quark-antiquark meson (\"\u03c0\")\nmass as a function of the PCAC quark mass mQ . For strong bare coupling, i.e. small \u03b2L ,\n\u221a\nwe find that the pseudoscalar mass is proportional to mQ . This is the expected behaviour\nin the presence of chiral symmetry breaking, if the pseudoscalar is the Goldstone boson\nof the broken symmetry. Consistently with this behaviour the vector meson (\"\u03c1\") mass\nhas a finite intercept for these same \u03b2L values; the results for the vector mass are shown\nin Fig. 3. However, as \u03b2L is increased above \u03b2L \u223c 2, the location of the possible critical\npoint, there is a qualitative change: the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses now appear\nlinearly proportional to mQ , and very nearly degenerate.\nAs an alternative way to plot these results, in Fig. 3 we show the pseudoscalar-vector\nmass ratio m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 for the theory with adjoint fermions. The close degeneracy of the\npseudoscalar and vector meson masses at large \u03b2L is evident. In Fig. 3 we show the mass\nratio of the three quark state with spin 1/2 (\"proton\") and the vector meson \u03c1.

At large \u03b2L (small bare coupling) all measured masses\nin the adjoint quark theory are approximately proportional to mQ .

At small \u03b2L we observe chiral symmetry breaking, but we cannot quite reach the zero\nquark mass limit because of the first order phase transition at small mQ . If the theory has\nan exact IR fixed point, the chiral symmetry breaking is probably a lattice artifact not\npresent in the continuum theory.\nHowever, this interpretation should be taken with care: qualitatively similar behaviour\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fm\u03c0/m\u03c1 SU(2)-fundamental\n1.1\n\n1\n\nm\u03c0/m\u03c1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\u03b2L=1.7\n\u03b2L=2.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\nmQ a\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\nFigure 9: Same as Fig. 3 but for fundamental representation quarks.\n\nmay arise even in the theory with fundamental fermions where the coupling is QCD-like,\nasymptotically free and running and the theory is in the chiral symmetry breaking phase.\nFor comparison, in Fig. 3 we show the ratio of the pseudoscalar and the vector meson\nmasses in the SU(2) theory with fundamental fermions. The result is qualitatively very\nsimilar to the adjoint representation case in Fig. 3. In this case the reason for this behaviour\nis clear: at small \u03b2L we observe the standard chiral symmetry breaking pattern, but at\nlarge \u03b2L the lattice volume becomes so small (lattice size L < 1/\u039bQCD ) that the system\nbecomes effectively deconfined, leading to behaviour which appears almost conformal at\nsmall mQ . However, in this case we know that the chiral symmetry breaking appears at\narbitrarily large \u03b2L , provided that the lattice volume is large enough and the resolution\nof the measurements is sufficiently high. Thus, the value of \u03b2L where the apparent chiral\nsymmetry restoration happens should depend on the system size, with faster evolution of\nthe running coupling giving stronger volume dependence.\nIn the simulations with the adjoint representation quarks we see no systematic volume\ndependence in the location of the critical point where the chiral symmetry appears to\nbecome restored: in our range of volumes 84 \u2013 324 , on \u03b2L = 2.2 lattices we observe no clear\nsigns of chiral symmetry breaking (neglecting the mQ a \u2248 0 point in Fig. 3), whereas at\n\u03b2L = 1.9 we already see the first order phase transition. The stability of the critical point\nshown in Fig. 3 supports the view that it is a lattice artifact not present in the continuum\ntheory. If there is no chiral symmetry breaking on the weak coupling (large \u03b2L ) side of the\ncritical point, the continuum theory does not possess it either. This would be compatible\nwith the infrared fixed point behaviour. Naturally, our numerical results cannot exclude\nthe possibility of chiral symmetry breaking even at large \u03b2L ; it may just evade detection\nwithin our accuracy and accessible volumes. We discuss the implications of our results in\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fmore detail below.\n\n4. Conclusions and outlook\nWe have investigated the strong coupling dynamics of SU(2) gauge theory with two fermion\nflavours in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The aim of the study has been\nto determine whether this theory could provide a concrete example of (infrared) conformal\nor almost conformal theory. Phenomenologically such behaviour would be useful in the\napplication to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, also known as walking technicolor, or some other beyond Standard model phenomenology like unparticle physics. We\nhave determined the schematic phase diagram of the lattice theory and discussed its implications for continuum physics and also compared with the corresponding results in the\ncase of fundamental representation fermions. Furthermore, we have analysed the spectrum\nof this theory. Even though the spectrum may be argued to present evidence in support\nof conformal behaviour, these arguments need to be treated with care. By comparing to\nsimilar measurements carried out for two flavours of fermions in the fundamental representation, we have shown that it is not possible to rule out the possibility of these behaviours\nbeing due to finite volume artifacts. Definitive answer about the scale dependence of the\ncoupling constant can only be provided by a dedicated measurement of the \u03b2-function of\nthis theory.\nNevertheless, even without such measurement we can discuss how the results presented\nhere can be contrasted with the evolution of the coupling. There are various options for\nasymptotically free coupling:\nI) QCD-like running coupling: the continuum limit is at \u03b2L \u2192 \u221e, and there is\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the mQ \u2192 0 limit. However, at large \u03b2L the\nlattice volumes required to observe the chiral symmetry breaking are prohibitively large.\nAt too small volumes the theory may look almost conformal. However, because the chiral\nsymmetry restoration is a finite volume effect, we can expect that at least some of the\nchiral observables should show clear volume dependence, which we do not observe here.\nII) IR fixed point: if \u03b2L is large enough, the theory flows into the IR fixed point and\nthere is no chiral symmetry breaking. The formal continuum limit is still at \u03b2L \u2192 \u221e. The\nobserved chiral symmetry breaking is a lattice artifact not connected to continuum physics\n(assuming mQ = 0).\nIII) Walking coupling: while this belongs to the same universality class as case I (and\nthus has chiral symmetry breaking), depending on the degree of \"walking\" it interpolates\nbetween cases I and II. Thus, it can be very hard to distinguish from either of the cases\nabove. We can obtain this behaviour from case II by adding a small mass to the quarks,\nfor example.\nIf we allow for \u03b2(g) > 0, corresponding to the dashed-dotted line on the right side of\nthe fixed point in Fig. 1, there is also a further option corresponding to the free electric\nphase of the theory. In this case the theory is not asymptotically free and for small \u03b2L , the\ntheory flows into the IR fixed point and there is no chiral symmetry breaking. Since the\ncontinuum limit in this case is at \u03b2L \u2192 0, our results show that the consistent continuum\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\flimit does not exist due to the observed onset of chiral symmetry breaking at \u03b2L \u223c 2.\nOf course, it is possible that chiral symmetry is broken in the free electric phase leading\nto even more exotic scenarios for the \u03b2-function than the three sketched in Fig. 1: there\ncould be multiple zeros, corresponding to nontrivial fixed points both in the infrared and\nultraviolet. In such a case it would be possible to reach continuum also for \u03b2 > 0. Also,\nyet another logical possibility would be a single zero of second order, or even non-analytic\nbehaviour of the \u03b2-function at the IR fixed point.\nTo summarise, we have determined the lattice phase diagram and the excitation spectrum of SU(2) gauge field theory with two flavours of adjoint representation quarks. This\nis a necessary step in the resolution of the strong coupling dynamics of the theory. While\nthe results from the spectrum measurement alone are not sufficient to reliably resolve the\ntype of the evolution of the coupling constant, the results are an important ingredient for\nfuture direct measurements of the full non-perturbative \u03b2-function. Particularly important\nphenomenon is chiral symmetry breaking which is well encoded into the spectrum of the\ntheory.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M. Antola, K. Kajantie and F.
