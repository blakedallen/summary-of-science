We then explore a specific model with an inflaton modulus field coupled to fields that\nprovide the continuous dissipation needed for warm inflation and argue the results are generic for a\nlarge class of models.\n\nThe inflationary scenario has been very successful in\nexplaining various cosmological questions. In the current\nera of precision cosmological data, the physics governing inflation is becoming increasingly illuminated [1], a\nsituation which should continue to improve with near future experiments [2]. On the theoretical side one would\nlike to demonstrate that inflation arises naturally from a\nfundamental theory. The hope is that string theory can\nprovide just such a microphysical basis for inflation.\nThere has been a substantial amount of recent work on\nembedding inflation into string theory (for reviews and\nreferences see [3]). Much of this work is done within the\nlandscape of flux compactifications, focusing heavily on\nmodels in warped backgrounds of the KKLMMT variety\n[4]. A recurrent obstacle in such studies is the eta problem (familiar from supergravity inflation [5]) which essentially pertains to the flatness of the potential. It can\nbe shown that higher order corrections to the inflaton\nmass will give rise to an O(1) correction to the inflaton\nmass, creating a potential that is too steep to support an\ninflationary phase lasting long enough to coincide with\nobservation. This correction then needs to be cancelled\nby terms arising, for example, from the geometric considerations of the specific compactification manifold under\ninvestigation [6, 7]. The eta problem may then be circumvented, but only in a finely tuned fashion.\nSince the eta problem is ubiquitous in inflationary\nmodels in string theory we would like to investigate another solution, warm inflation (WI) [8], which has been\nshown in other contexts to naturally alleviate the eta\nproblem. Due to the number of fields which arise in string\ncompactifications, a stringy setting provides all the requisite ingredients for warm inflation. Although warm inflation may operate in any given background (including the\nwarped background alluded to earlier), our specific model\nwill be realized in a space with an enhanced symmetry\npoint (ESP), leaving investigations of other backgrounds\nto future works.\nAn ESP is a point in field space where gauge symmetries may be enhanced and massive fields can become\nmassless. This has the interesting property that it can\nlead to the dynamical trapping of moduli fields [10], giving the ESP the status of a preferred point in field space.\nThe trapping mechanism has been studied [11] as an environment where inflation may be implemented. Imag-\n\nine a scalar inflaton \u03c6 coupled to another scalar field \u03be\nthat becomes massless (due to its interaction with the\ninflaton) at an ESP. The particles associated with \u03be will\nbe copiously produced as the inflaton moves towards the\nESP. The inflaton will be caught in a damped oscillation\nabout the ESP, giving up its to particle production. The\nkinetic energy of the oscillation will eventually fall below\nthat of the potential, leading to trapped inflation. The\nuniverse may then be reheated by the decay of a curvaton\nfield.\nHere we propose an alternative method of inflation and\nreheating that begins with moduli trapping but concludes\nwith heating through the WI paradigm [8, 9]. Inflationary expansion and radiation production occur concurrently and arises dynamically in WI through the the\npresence of fields with which the inflaton interacts during\ninflation, resulting in dissipation and particle production.\nThe presence of radiation during inflation also allows the\nend of inflation to occur when the vacuum energy density\nis falling faster than the radiation energy density, so that\nat some point a smooth crossover occurs from inflation\nto radiation domination, without a separate reheating\nphase. (For reviews of warm inflation and its origin from\nquantum field theory see [12].)\nWe examine a generalization of the model found in\n[10] where we include additional scalar fields which leads\nto an alteration of the trapping and provides new channels of inflaton energy dissipation leading to warm inflation. Moduli fields naturally arise in stringy contexts\ndue to perturbations or deformations of the background\ncompactification geometry or the presence of branes and\nfluxes. The number of such moduli fields is determined\nby the compactification data and can be quite large. For\nexample, in Calabi-Yau compactifications one finds complex structure (shape) and Kahler (size) moduli, whose\nmultiplicities are given by the Hodge numbers h2,1 and\nh1,1 respectively. The presence of branes and fluxes adds\nmore to the field count. It is not atypical then to expect the number of degrees of freedom of the system\nto run into the hundreds or thousands (some examples\nwith large field numbers are found in assisted inflation\nin M-theory with hundreds of fields [13], or N -flation\nwhich may incorporate thousands of axion fields [14]).\nRecently there has also appeared work [15] which incorporates large numbers of dynamical fields in staggered\n\n\f2\ninflation models, where the inflaton fields decay after encountering a steep drop in their potential in contrast to\nthe warm inflation mechanism employed here.\nMany works choose to limit modulus numbers by invoking stabilisation mechanisms, for all but one or a few\nmoduli at high scales. The resulting effective action has\nfewer degrees of freedom operating during inflation, facilitating the calculation and providing less complicated\ndynamics. The naturalness of arriving at an effective\naction with only a single or few moduli can be questioned, especially in light of the multiplicity of vacua\nin the string landscape. Here we assume many moduli\nparticipate during the inflationary phase. The moduli\nfields cannot be too light (the mass should be m & 100\nTeV), otherwise the successful predictions of nucleosynthesis would be jeopardized [16].\nAn investigation of trapped inflation originating in\nstring theory has been undertaken in [17] using wrapped\nD4-branes in type IIA compactifications [18], as well as a\nscenario involving axion moduli in a type IIB compactification on a warped Calabi-Yau space [19]. Some ingredients of the warm inflation scenario we are presenting are\nseen to arise there (such as large numbers of light fields,\nwhere, in the IIB example, the number of light species\nis given by the square of the number of circuits of the\nfundamental axion that can fit within the compactification, and the number of circuits can be of O(103 \u2212 104 )).\nAlthough we have not employed these specific examples\nin our present work, we find their structure to be complementary to our approach.\nWe now focus on a generalization of the model of [10]\nL=\n\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2202 \u03bc \u03c7 \u2212 2g 2 \u03c62 \u03c72 ,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the inflaton field and \u03c7 is another scalar field.\nLet \u03c6 approach the origin with trajectory \u03c6(t) = i\u03bc + vt,\nwhere \u03bc is the impact parameter. At the point < \u03c6 >= 0,\nthe \u03c7 field will become massless. It is assumed that the\n\u03c6 field has some time dependence which will then lead\nto production of \u03c7 particles that will largely take place\nnear the symmetry point < \u03c6 >= 0.\nWe begin with a superpotential of the form\n1\nW = \u221a (g\u03a6X 2 + hXY 2 ) ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the chiral superfield X has \u03c7 and \u03c8\u03c7 as its scalar\nand fermionic components, and the chiral superfield Y\nhas \u03bb and \u03c8\u03bb as its scalar and fermionic components.\nEventually one would generalize the model to many\nfields, since this is the generic situation provided by string\ntheory [20]. The coupling constant h is kept arbitrary.\nThis superpotential introduces the following terms into\nthe action:\n1\n1\n\u2212 L \u2283 g 2 \u03c74 + h2 \u03bb4 + 2gh\u03c6\u03c7\u03bb2 + 2h2 \u03c72 \u03bb2 + 2g 2 \u03c62 \u03c72(3)\n2\n2\n1\n+ \u221a (2g\u03c7\u03c8\u03c7 \u03c8\u03c6 + 2h\u03bb\u03c8\u03bb \u03c8\u03c7 + g\u03c6\u03c8\u03c7 \u03c8\u03c7 + h\u03c7\u03c8\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb )\n2\n\nWe now have all of the ingredients for warm inflation to\noperate. Namely, the inflaton field will excite a massive \u03c7\nfield which can then annihilate either back to the inflaton\n(\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) or to the \u03bb fields (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bb\u03bb), while also\ndirectly decaying \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c8\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb , the last two processes will\nthen dissipate the energy of the inflaton field.\nWe will first study the effects of the new annihilation\npath \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bb\u03bb on the trapping mechanism. The effect of\nthe \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 reaction on the trapping length was studied\nin [10]. Inclusion of the additional \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bb\u03bb requires only\nslight modification. The interaction cross section for each\nprocess is given by\n\u03c3\u03c6 =\n\n4h4 k \u2032\n4g 4 k \u2032\n; \u03c3\u03bb =\n,\n2\n\u03c0kE\n\u03c0kE 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere k is the incoming momentum, k \u2032 is the outgoing\nmomentum, E is the incoming energy, and the subscript\nindicates which field the \u03c7 will annihilate to form. The\nrate of loss of \u03c7 particles is then given by the change in\nnumber density\nq\nZ\n(k1 k2 )2 \u2212 m4\u03c7\n\u1e45(~k1 , t)\n(\u03c3\u03c6 + \u03c3\u03bb ) .(5)\n= \u2212 d~k2 n(~k2 , t)\nE1 E2\nn(~k1 , t)\nThis can then be evaluated in the center of mass frame\nin the non-relativistic limit, while ignoring the mass of\nthe \u03c6 particle, to obtain a bound on the decay\nZ\n8(g 4 + h4 )\n\u1e45(~k1 , t)\n\u2265\u2212\nd~k2 n(~k2 , t) .\n\u03c0m2\u03c7\nn(~k1 , t)\n\n(6)\n\nThe mass of the \u03c7 field is known from the \u03c6 motion and\nthe total number density of \u03c7 particles produced when \u03c6\nencounters the ESP, n\u03c7 , can be used to find the bound\n\u0015\n\u0014\nn(~k1 , t)\n8(g 4 + h4 )n\u03c7\n.\n\u2265 exp \u2212\n\u03c0(\u03bc2 + v 2 t2 )\nn(~k1 , 0)\n\n(7)\n\nOne then needs to calculate the energy density from the\n\u03c7 particles in order to find the new trapping length. The\nenergy is given by\nZ\np\nE = d~kn k 2 + 4g 2 (\u03bc2 + v 2 t2 )\n(8)\n\u0014\n\u0015\np\n\u22128(g 4 + h4 )n\u03c7\n,\n\u2265 n\u03c7 4g 2 (\u03bc2 + v 2 t2 ) exp\n\u03c0\u03bcv\nwhich leads to the new stopping length\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\u03c0g\u03bc2\n4(g 4 + h4 )n\u03c7\n\u03c0 3 1/2\nv exp\n. (9)\nexp\n\u03c6\u2217 = p\nv2\n\u03bcv\n2g 5\n\nWe see that the inclusion of an additional decay path\nfor the \u03c7 particles will not ruin the trapping effect,\nonly lengthen it with the additional h-dependent term\nexp[4h4 n\u03c7 /(\u03bcv)], while it will provide the necessary conditions for warm inflation.\n\n\f3\nIn an expanding universe, once particle production\nstops, the amplitude of the oscillations around the ESP\nwill decrease like the inverse of the scale factor [11]. Afterwards when the kinetic energy falls below that of the\npotential a period of inflation can start. With the interactions in the superpotential Eq. (2) we can have\nwarm inflation through a two-stage mechanism [21], in\nwhich the energy of the inflaton is dissipated into radiation through the X fields into the light Y fields. The\nextra friction term in the inflaton evolution equation induced by the dissipative dynamics translates generically\ninto a longer period of inflation, and therefore the possibility of having 60 e-folds of trapped inflation.\nThe dissipative coefficient has been computed based on\nthe adiabatic approximation for warm inflation quantum\nfield theory solutions [22]. The dominant contribution\ncomes from the interaction of the inflaton field \u03c6 with\nthe scalar \u03c7 and that of \u03c7 with the scalar \u03bb. The interactions depend on the coupling \"h\" in the superpotential,\nwhich previous to inflation leads to the direct decay path\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c8\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb . Therefore in order to allow for trapping one\nhas first to check that the \u03c7 particles do not decay before the inflaton field has reached the turning point, such\nthat the interaction potential induced by them do not\ndisappear. Due to the expansion, the decay takes place\nwhen the decay rate \u0393\u03c7 equals the Hubble rate, so that\nthe condition for trapping in the presence of this direct\ndecay channel is then: \u0393\u03c7T R < HT R , where the subindex\n\"TR\" refers to the trapping period. It is enough to check\nthis condition when the decay rate gets its larger value,\nat the turning point with \u03c6 equal to the amplitude of\nthe oscillations around the ESP. On the other hand, consistency of the approximations during warm inflation requires the decay rate to be larger than the Hubble rate\nduring inflation, i.e.: \u0393\u03c7inf > Hinf , with the subindex\n\"inf \" denoting now the time of inflation.\nTaking into account that we may have many fields X\nand Y , the total number of \u03c7 particles produced during\ntrapping is enhanced by a factor N\u03c7 counting the multiplicity of the X field, and the stopping length is therefore\nshortened by the inverse of this factor\n\u03c6\u2217 \u2243\n\n4\u03c0 3 1/2 \u22121\nv N\u03c7 ,\ng 5/2\n\n(10)\n\n2\n\nh\nNdec m\u03c7 , where Ndec ,\nThe decay rate is given by \u0393\u03c7 = 8\u03c0\nthe number of Y fields, is the number of decay channels\navailable in X \u2032 s decay, and m\u03c7 = g\u03c6. During particle\nproduction, when the field passes the ESP and reaches\nthe turning point, the Hubble rate is\u221agiven by the kinetic\nenergy of the field, with HT R \u2243 v/ 6. Using Eq. (10)\nin \u0393\u03c7T R < HT R , and demanding also \u03c6\u2217 < mP to avoid\novershooting, the condition to avoid \u03c7 decay reads:\n\u0012 2 \u00132\nN\u03c72\ng\nh2\n<\u221a\n.\n(11)\nNdec\n8\u03c0\n6\u03c0 4 4\u03c0\n\nTaking for example N\u03c7 & O(100) and Ndec . N\u03c7 , the\nabove condition can be easily fulfilled with both couplings\n\nof the order of O(1), without the need of imposing any\nhierarchy between them.\nTo check the consistency condition for warm inflation\nwe have to take into account that once particle production stops, the amplitude of the oscillations decreases like\nthe inverse of the scale factor, while the Hubble rate goes\nlike H \u221d a\u22122 , and therefore before inflation the decay\nrate becomes larger than the Hubble rate when:\n\u0012 2 \u00132\nN\u03c72\nHinf\ng\n< \u221a\n.\n(12)\n4\ngmP\n4\u03c0\n6\u03c0\nFor couplings of the order of O(1) this is a very mild\ncondition on the scale of inflation, which is naturally fulfilled.\nTherefore, by considering the presence of several moduli fields, i.e., large multiplicities for X and Y fields, trapping around the ESP is still possible even in the presence\nof the direct decay rate into fermions due to the coupling h, with strong couplings of order unity. At the\nsame time, strong couplings and large multiplicities are\nrequired in order to have enough dissipation for warm\ninflation. In the low T regime, when m\u03c7 > T , the dis3\nsipative coefficient goes like [22] \u03a5 \u2243 C\u03c6 h4 T\u03c62 , where\n2\nC\u03c6 = 0.04N\u03c7 Ndec\n. With h2 \u2243 4\u03c0 and multiplicities\nN\u03c7 \u2243 200, Ndec \u2243 30 we have C\u03c6 \u2243 106 ; by increasing the multiplicities by a factor of say 5, we would have\nC\u03c6 \u2243 108 . These are typical values required to realize\nWI within the low T approximation [9, 23], which can\nbe accomplished quite naturally in SO(10) or E6 grand\nunification models and in models where the inflaton interacts with many massive string modes causing dissipation\nof vacuum energy i.e., warm inflation, like in [20]. Moreover a coupling g 2 /(4\u03c0) & 0.3 ensures that the bound on\nEq. (11) is fulfilled.\nAs a specific example, let us assume that the ESP generates a maximum at vanishing field value in the scalar\npotential, and inflation proceeds after trapping with the\nfield rolling away from the origin i.e., hilltop inflation.\nThe simplest inflationary potential to parametrize this\nscenario would be V = V0 \u2212 12 |m\u03c6 |2 \u03c62 . During hilltop\nwarm inflation, the ratio of the dissipative coefficient\nto the Hubble rate Q = \u03a5/(3H) decreases, but T and\nm\u03c7 /T increase, so once in the low T regime the approximation holds until the end of inflation and it can\nbe studied analytically [23]. For example, with a value\nC\u03c6 \u2243 106 we can have 40-60 e-folds of inflation in the\nweak dissipative regime with Q < 1, and a subplanckian\n1/4\nvalue of the field up to the end when V0 . 10\u22123 mP .\nThe prediction for the spectral index nS at lowest order in the slow-roll parameters is the same than in hilltop cold inflation, nS \u2243 1 + 2\u03b7\u03c6 , so that it will be\nwithin the observed range for a mass parameter such\nthat |\u03b7\u03c6 | \u2243 |m2\u03c6 |/(3H 2 ) \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 . On the other hand,\nby increasing the multiplicities such that C\u03c6 \u2243 108 , we\ncan have the 40-60 e-folds of inflation in the strong dissipative regime with Q > 1, and get the right predictions for the primordial spectrum for larger values of\n\n\f4\nthe mass and |\u03b7\u03c6 |. With |\u03b7\u03c6 | \u2243 1 we have nS \u2243 0.94,\n1/4\nand V0\n. 10\u22124 mP ensures that the field at the end\nis still below the Planck scale. Restricting the height of\nthe potential to retain \u03c6 < mP during inflation, we implicitly restrict the amount of radiation dissipated during\nwarm inflation (although the radiation energy density increases), such that it is still subdominant at the end of the\ninflation. By further increasing the dissipative parameter\nso that C\u03c6 & 109 , and at the same time, the inflaton mass\nup to values |\u03b7\u03c6 | & O(100), we recover the possibility of\na smooth transition from inflation to radiation domination at the end of warm inflation with V0 \u2243 10\u22124 mP ,\nand nS \u2243 0.95, i.e., well within the observational range.\nIn this case multiplicities and couplings of the order of\nN\u03c7 \u2243 103 , Ndec \u2243 350, h2 \u2243 4\u03c0 are required, but still\nwith g 2 /(4\u03c0) & 0.2 the bound in Eq. (11) for trapping is\nfulfilled.\nInflation is a successful scenario in need of a theoretical home, with string theory being the leading candidate.\nThis decade has seen an explosion of ideas on just how\nthis may be accomplished. One obstacle which is ubiquitous in the string theory approach is the eta problem.\nThere currently is much work going towards its solution\nbut some residual fine tuning appears to remain. We\nhave examined an alternative approach towards rectifying the eta problem, namely invoking the warm inflation\nscenario, which changes the nature of, and subsequently\n\nsolves, the inherent eta problem. String theory seems to\nbe a natural place for the warm inflationary mechanism\nto operate due to generic presence of multitudes of moduli fields. Here we have demonstrated a possible example\nof warm inflation in the context of trapped inflation, a\nscenario which is interesting in its own right from a field\ntheoretic viewpoint, but has also been demonstrated to\narise in string contexts. Although we are looking at only\nthis corner of the vast landscape of string theory, we believe this to be an instructive example which may be\nimplemented in other inflationary models in string theory. Since warm inflation can provide a natural solution\nto the eta problem, which has been a major barrier to\nstring model building, and since strings possess a large\nnumber of fields, which is an important ingredient for\nmost warm inflation models, we believe warm inflation\nmay have a natural setting in string theory. We believe\nthat this is a step towards the warm inflation scenario,\nand its attendant attractive properties, finding a home\nin the string realm.\n\n[1] H. V. Peiris et al.
