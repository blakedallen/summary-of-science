This simultaneous\nappearance of billiards (with chaotic properties in important physical cases)\nand of an underlying symmetry structure (infinite-dimensional Lie algebra) is\nan interesting fact, which deserves to be studied in depth. Before explaining\nin detail the techniques (including the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian\nformalism [1]) that have been used to uncover this fact, we shall start by\nreviewing previous related works, and by stating the main results of this\nbilliard/symmetry connection.\nThe simplest example of this connection concerns the pure Einstein system, i.e. Ricci-flat spacetimes. Long ago, Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) [8, 9, 10] gave a description of the asymptotic behaviour, near\na spacelike singularity, of the general solution of Ricci tensor = 0 in (3 + 1)dimensional spacetime in terms of a continuous collection of second-order,\nnon linear ordinary differential equations (with respect to the time variable). As argued by these authors, near the singularity the spatial points\nxi , i = 1, 2, 3, essentially decouple, and this decoupling allows one to approximate a system of partial differential equations (PDE's) in 4 variables (t, xi )\nby a 3-dimensional family, parametrized by (xi ) \u2208 R3 , of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) with respect to the time variable t. The coefficients\nentering the nonlinear terms of these ODE's depend on the spatial point\nxi but are the same, at each given xi , as those that arise in some spatially\nhomogeneous models. In the presently considered 4-dimensional \"vacuum\"\n(i.e. Ricci-flat) case, the spatially homogeneous models that capture the\nbehaviour of the general solution are of the Bianchi type IX or VIII (with\nhomogeneity groups SU(2) or SL(2, R), respectively). The asymptotic evolution of the metric was then found to be describable in terms of a chaotic\n[60, 18] sequence of generalized Kasner (i.e. power-law) solutions, exhibiting \"oscillations\" of the scale factors along independent spatial directions\n[8, 9, 10], or, equivalently, as a billiard motion [19, 64] on the Lobachevskii\nplane.\nThis picture, found by BKL in the 4-dimensional pure Einstein case, was\nthen generalized in various directions: namely by adding more spatial dimensions, or by adding matter fields. Remarkably, it was found that there\nexists a critical spacetime dimension for the asymptotic behaviour of the general Ricci-flat solution [34]. When D \u2264 10 the solution exhibits a BKL-type\nnever-ending oscillatory behaviour with strong chaotic properties, while when\nD \u2265 11 the general solution ceases to exhibit chaotic features, but is instead\n2\n\n\fasymptotically characterized by a monotonic Kasner-like solution [34, 30].\nThe addition of matter fields was also found to feature a similar subcritical/overcritical classification [7, 24, 30]. Let us consider, in some given spacetime dimension D, the Einstein-dilaton-p-form system, i.e. let us add a massless scalar \u03c6, and one or several p-form fields A = A\u03bc1 ...\u03bcp dx\u03bc1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dx\u03bcp /p!.\nIt was found that the general solution, near a cosmological singularity, of\nthis system is monotonic and Kasner-like if the dilaton couplings \u03bbp (defined\nbelow) of the p-forms belong to some (dimension dependent) open neighbourhood of zero [30], while it is chaotic and BKL-like if the dilaton couplings belong to the (closed) complement of the latter neighbourhood. In the absence\nof any p-forms, the Einstein-dilaton system is found to be asymptotically\nmonotonic and Kasner-like [7, 2].\nA convenient tool for describing the qualitative behaviour of the general\nsolution near a spacelike singularity is to relate it to billiard motion in an\nauxiliary Lorentzian space, or, after projection on the unit hyperboloid, to\nbilliard motion on Lobachevskii space. This billiard picture naturally follows\nfrom the Hamiltonian approach to cosmological behaviour (initiated long ago\n[63] in the context of the Bianchi IX models; see [49] for a recent review),\nand was first obtained in the 4-dimensional case [19, 64] and then extended\nto higher spacetime dimensions with p-forms and dilaton [54, 56, 45, 46, 26].\nRecent work has improved the derivation of the billiard picture by using\nthe Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric and by highlighting the\ngeneral mechanism by which all the \"off-diagonal\" degrees of freedom (i.e.\nall the variables except for the scale factors, the dilaton and their conjugate\nmomenta) get \"asymptotically frozen\" [29].\nThe billiard dynamics describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour\nof D-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to n dilatons \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n (having\nminimal kinetic terms \u2212\u03a3j |d\u03c6j |2 ), and to an arbitrary menu of p-forms (with\nkinetic terms \u223c \u2212eh\u03bbp ,\u03c6i |dAp |2 , where \u03bbp is a linear form) consists of a \"billiard\nball\" moving along a future-directed null geodesic (i.e. a \"light ray\") of a\n(D \u2212 1 + n)-dimensional Lorentzian space, except when it undergoes specular\nreflections on a set of hyperplanar walls (or \"mirrors\") passing through the\norigin of Lorentzian space. One can refer to this billiard as being an \"Einstein\nbilliard\" (or a \"cosmological billiard\").\nAs we shall see below in detail the degrees of freedom of the billiard ball\ncorrespond, for D \u2212 1 of them, to the logarithms, \u22122\u03b2 a , of the scale factors,\ni.e. the diagonal components of the (D \u2212 1) \u00d7 (D \u2212 1) spatial metric in\nan Iwasawa decomposition, and, for the remaining ones, to the n dilatons\n3\n\n\f\u03c6j . The walls come from the asymptotic elimination (in the Arnowitt-DeserMisner Hamiltonian [1]) of the remaining \"off-diagonal\" degrees of freedom:\noff-diagonal components of the metric, p-form fields, and their conjugate\nmomenta. It is often convenient to project the Lorentzian billiard motion\n(by a linear projection centered on the origin) onto the future half of the\nunit hyperboloid G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd = \u22121, where (\u03b2 \u03bc ) \u2261 (\u03b2 a , \u03c6j ) denotes the position\nin, and G\u03bc\u03bd the metric of (D \u2212 1 + n)-dimensional Lorentzian space. [The\nsignature of G\u03bc\u03bd is \u2212 + + . . . +.] This projection leads to a billiard motion in\na domain of hyperbolic space HD\u22122+n , see Fig. 1. This domain (the \"billiard\ntable\"1 ) is the intersection of a finite number of half hyperbolic spaces, say the\npositive sides of the hyperbolic hyperplanar walls defined by intersecting the\noriginal Lorentzian hyperplanar walls with the unit hyperboloid G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd =\n\u22121.\nThe distinction mentioned above between a chaotic, BKL-like behaviour\nand a monotonic, Kasner-like one then corresponds to the distinction between\na finite-volume billiard table (in HD\u22122+n ) and an infinite-volume one. One\ncould further distinguish: (i) the overcritical case (compact billiard table),\n(ii) the critical case (finite-volume, but non-compact billiard table) and (iii)\nthe subcritical case (infinite-volume billiard table). Both cases (i) and (ii)\nlead to never-ending, chaotic oscillations of the scale factors (and of the\ndilatons), while case (iii) leads, after a finite number of reflections off the\nwalls (i.e. after a finite number of oscillations of the scale factors and of the\ndilatons), to an asymptotically free motion of \u03b2 \u03bc (null geodesic), corresponding to an asymptotically monotonic, Kasner-like (power-law) behaviour of\nthe spacetime metric near the singularity, see Fig. 1. In actual physical\nmodels, only the critical and subcritical cases are found.\nHaving introduced the concept of (Lorentzian or, after projection, hyperbolic) billiard table associated to general classes of Einstein-matter systems,\nwe can now describe the connection uncovered in [24, 25, 26, 27, 23, 28, 29]\nbetween certain specific Einstein-matter systems and Lorentzian Kac-Moody\nalgebras. In the leading asymptotic approximation to the behaviour near the\ncosmological singularity, this connection is simply that the (Lorentzian) billiard table describing this behaviour can be identified with the (Lorentzian)\nWeyl chamber of some corresponding (model-dependent) Lorentzian Kac1\n\nWe use the term \"billiard table\" to refer to the domain within which the billiard\nmotion is confined. Note, however, that this \"table\" is, in general, of dimension higher\nthan two, and is either considered in Lorentzian space or, after projection, in hyperbolic\nspace.\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Sketch of billiard tables describing the asymptotic cosmological\nbehaviour of Einstein-matter systems. The upper panels are drawn in the\n(D\u22121+n)\u2013dimensional auxiliary Lorentzian space spanned by (\u03b2 \u03bc ) = (\u03b2 a , \u03c6).\n[D = 4 and n = 0 in the case drawn here.] The billiard tables are represented\nas \"wedges\" in [(2 + 1)\u2013dimensional] \u03b2-space, bounded by hyperplanar walls\nwA (\u03b2) = 0 on which the (unrepresented) billiard ball undergoes specular\nreflections. The upper left panel is a (critical) \"chaotic\" billiard table (contained within the \u03b2-space future light cone), while the upper right one is a\n(subcritical) \"non-chaotic\" one (extending beyond the light cone). The lower\npanels represent the corresponding billiard tables (and billiard motions) after projection onto hyperbolic space [H2 in the case drawn here]. The latter\nprojection is defined in the text by central projection onto \u03b3-space (i.e. the\nunit hyperboloid G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd = \u22121, see upper panels), and is represented in\nthe lower panels by its image in the Poincar\u00e9 ball [disc]. \"Chaotic\" billiard\ntables have finite volume in hyperbolic space, while \"non-chaotic\" ones have\ninfinite volume.\n\n5\n\n\fMoody algebra. We recall that the Weyl chamber of a Lie algebra with simple\nroots2 \u03b1i , i = 1, . . . , r (r being the rank of the algebra) is the domain of the\nCartan subalgebra (parametrized by \u03b2 \u2208 Rr ) where h\u03b1i , \u03b2i \u2265 0 for all i's. For\nthis connection to be possible many conditions must be met. In particular:\n(i) the billiard table must be a Coxeter polyhedron, i.e. the dihedral angles\nbetween adjacent walls must be integer submultiples of \u03c0 (i.e., of the form\n\u03c0/k where k is an integer \u2265 2), and (ii) the billiard table must be a simplex,\ni.e. have exactly D \u2212 1 + n faces. It is remarkable that this seemingly very\nspecial case of a \"Kac-Moody billiard\" is found to occur in many physically\ninteresting Einstein-matter systems. For instance, pure Einstein gravity in\nD-dimensional spacetime corresponds to the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra\nAED\u22121 [27]. The latter algebra is the canonical Lorentzian extension [52]\nof the ordinary (finite-dimensional) Lie algebra AD\u22123 (= slD\u22122 ). Another\ninteresting connection between qualitative PDE behaviour and Kac-Moody\ntheoretic concepts is that the transition between \"critical\" chaotic, BKLlike behaviour in \"low dimensions\" (D \u2264 10) and \"subcritical\" monotonic,\nKasner-like behaviour in \"high dimensions\" (D \u2265 11) is found to be in strict\ncorrespondence with a transition between an hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra\n(AED\u22121 for D \u2264 10) and a non hyperbolic one (AED\u22121 for D \u2265 11). We\nrecall here that V. Kac [52] defines a Kac-Moody algebra to be hyperbolic\nby the condition that any subdiagram obtained by removing a node from its\nDynkin diagram be either of finite or affine type. Hyperbolic Kac-Moody\nalgebras are necessarily Lorentzian (i.e. the symmetrizable Cartan matrix is\nof Lorentzian signature), but the reverse is not true in general.\nAnother connection between physically interesting Einstein-matter systems and Kac-Moody algebras concerns the low-energy bosonic effective actions arising in String and M-theory. Bosonic String theory in any spacetime dimension D is related to the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra DED\n[26, 23]. The latter algebra is the canonical Lorentzian extension of the\nfinite-dimensional algebra DD\u22122 . The various Superstring theories (in the\ncritical dimension D = 10) and M-theory have been found [26] to be related\neither to E10 (when there are two sypersymmetries in D = 10, i.e. for type\nIIA, type IIB and M-theory) or to BE10 (when there is only one supersymmetry in D = 10, i.e. for type I and the two heterotic theories), see Fig. 2.\n2\n\nThe roots \u03b1 are linear forms on a Cartan subalgebra h that appear as eigenvalues of\nthe adjoint action of h on the rest of the Lie algebra: [h, e\u03b1 ] = \u03b1(h)e\u03b1 for all h \u2208 h . In\nthe simple case of the Lie algebra of SU (2), h = {Jz } is one-dimensional and the \"raising\"\nor \"lowering\" operators e\u03b1 = Jx \u00b1 iJy correspond to the roots \u03b1(Jz ) = \u00b11.\n\n6\n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nE10\n\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nBE10\n\n1\n\n10\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nDE10\n\n0\n\n2\n10\n\nFigure 2: Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams encoding the geometry of the billiard\ntables describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of three blocks of\nstring theories: B2 = {M-theory, type IIA and type IIB superstring theories},\nB1 = {type I and the two heterotic superstring theories}, and B0 = {closed\nbosonic string theory in D = 10}. Each node of the diagrams represents\na dominant wall of the corresponding cosmological billiard. Each Coxeter\ndiagram of a billiard table corresponds to the Dynkin diagram of a corresponding (hyperbolic) Kac-Moody algebra: E10 , BE10 and DE10 , respectively. In\nother words, the cosmological billiard tables can be identified with the Weyl\nchambers of the corresponding Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras.\nSee Ref. [40] for a discussion of the billiards associated to all types of pure\nsupergravities in D = 4. See Ref. [23] for the construction of Einstein-matter\nsystems related (in the above \"billiard\" sense) to the canonical Lorentzian\nextensions of all the finite-dimensional Lie algebras (An , Bn , Cn , Dn , G2 , F4 ,\nE6 , E7 and E8 ). See also Ref. [32] for the identification of all the hyperbolic\nKac-Moody algebras whose Weyl chambers are Einstein billiards.\nRef. [28] has studied in more detail the correspondence between the specific Einstein-three-form system (including a Chern-Simons term) describing the bosonic sector of 11-dimensional supergravity (also known as the\n\"low-energy limit of M-theory\") and the hyperbolic Kac-Moody group E10 .\nRef. [28] introduced a formal expansion of the field equations in terms of\npositive roots, i.e. combinations \u03b1 = \u03a3i ni \u03b1i of simple roots of E10 , \u03b1i ,\ni = 1, . . . , 10, where the ni 's are integers \u2265 0. It is then useful to order this\nexpansion according to the height of the positive root \u03b1 = \u03a3i ni \u03b1i , defined\nas ht(\u03b1) = \u03a3i ni . The correspondence discussed above between the leading\nasymptotic evolution near a cosmological singularity (described by a billiard)\n7\n\n\fand Weyl chambers of Kac-Moody algebras involves only the terms in the\nfield equation whose height is ht(\u03b1) \u2264 1. By contrast, Ref. [28] could show,\nby explicit calculations, that there exists a way to define, at each spatial\npoint x, a correspondence between the field variables g\u03bc\u03bd (t, x), A\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb (t, x)\n(and their gradients), and a (finite) subset of the parameters defining an element of the (infinite-dimensional) coset space E10 /K(E10 ) [where K(E10 )\ndenotes the maximal compact subgroup of E10 ], such that the (PDE) field\nequations of supergravity get mapped onto the (ODE) equations describing\na null geodesic in E10 /K(E10 ) up to terms of height 30.\nA complementary check of the correspondence between 11-dimensional\nsupergravity and the E10 /K(E10 ) \u03c3-model has been obtained in [31]. This\nresult was further extended to the correspondence between the E10 /K(E10 )\n\u03c3-model and, both, massive 10-dimensional IIA supergravity [57] and tendimensional IIB supergravity [58].\nThese tantalizing results suggest that the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic\nKac-Moody group E10 may be a \"hidden symmetry\" of supergravity, in the\nsense of mapping solutions onto other solutions (the appearance of E10 as\npossible symmetry group of supergravity was first hinted at by Julia long ago\n[50, 51]). Note that the conjecture here is that the continuous group E10 (R)\nbe a hidden symmetry group of classical supergravity. At the quantum level,\ni.e. for M-theory, one expects only a discrete version of E10 , say E10 (Z),\nto be a quantum symmetry. See [16] for recent work trying to extend the\nidentification of [28] between roots of E10 and symmetries of supergravity/Mtheory beyond height 30, and for references about previous suggestions of a\npossible role of E10 . For earlier appearances of the Weyl groups of the E\nseries in the context of U-duality see [61, 65, 3]. A series of recent papers\n[71, 68, 69, 35, 36] has also explored the possible role of E11 (a non-hyperbolic\nextension of E10 ) as hidden symmetry of M-theory. See also [41] for another\napproach to the search for symmetries of M theory.\nIt is also tempting to assume that the Kac-Moody groups underlying\nthe other (special) Einstein-matter systems discussed above might be hidden\n(solution-generating) symmetries. For instance, in the case of pure Einstein\ngravity in D = 4 spacetime, the conjecture is that AE3 is such a symmetry\nof Einstein gravity. [This case, and the correspondence between the field\nvariables and the coset ones is further discussed in [29].]\nTo end this introductory summary, it is important to add a significant\nmathematical caveat. Most of the results mentioned above have been obtained by \"physicists' methods\", i.e. non rigorous arguments. [See, however,\n8\n\n\fthe mathematical results of [67] concerning the dynamics of the Bianchi type\nIX homogeneous model.] The only exception concerns the \"non chaotic\",\nmonotonic, Kasner-like behaviour of the \"subcritical\" systems. The first\nmathematical proof that a general solution of the four-dimensional Einsteindilaton system has a non chaotic, Kasner-like behaviour was obtained by\nAndersson and Rendall [2]. By using, and slightly extending, the tools of\nthis proof (Theorem 3 of [2], concerning certain Fuchsian systems), Ref. [30]\nhas then given mathematical proofs of the Kasner-like behaviour of more general classes of Einstein-matter systems, notably the D-dimensional coupled\nEinstein-dilaton-p-form system when the dilaton couplings of the p-forms belong to the subcritical domain mentioned above. Ref. [30] also gave a proof of\nthe Kasner-like behaviour of pure gravity (Ricci tensor = 0) when the spacetime dimension D \u2265 11. For other mathematical studies on \"non-chaotic\"\ncases see Ref. [44].\nAn important mathematical challenge is to convert the physicists' arguments (summarized in the rest of this review) concerning the \"chaotic\nbilliard\" structure of critical (and over critical) systems into precise mathematical statements. The recent work [28, 29], which provides a simplified\nderivation of the billiard picture and a rather clean decomposition of the field\nvariables into \"ODE-described chaotic\" and \"asymptotically frozen\" pieces,\nmight furnish a useful starting point for formulating precise mathematical\nstatements. In this respect, let us note two things: (i) a good news is that\nnumerical simulations have fully confirmed the BKL chaotic-billiard picture\nin several models [12, 11], (ii) a bad news is that the physicists' arguments\nmight oversimplify the picture by neglecting \"non generic\" spatial points\nwhere some of the leading walls disappear, because the spatially-dependent\ncoefficients measuring the strength of these walls happen to vanish. A similar subtlety (vanishing at exceptional spatial points of wall coefficients) takes\nplace in the subcritical, non chaotic case (where a finite number of collisions\non the billiard walls is expected to channel the billiard ball in the \"good\",\nKasner-like directions). See discussions of this phenomenon in [11, 66].\nIn the rest of this review, we shall outline the various arguments leading\nto the conclusions summarized above. For a more complete derivation of the\nbilliard results see [29].\n\n9\n\n\f2\n\nModels and Gauge Conditions\n\nWe consider models of the general form\n\u0014\nZ\n(p)\nD \u221a\nS[gM N , \u03c6, A ] = d x \u2212g R(g) \u2212 \u2202M \u03c6\u2202 M \u03c6\n\n\u0015\n1X\n1\n\u03bbp \u03c6 (p)\n(p) M1 ***Mp+1\n\u2212\n+ ...\ne FM1 ***Mp+1 F\n2 p (p + 1)!\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere units are chosen such that 16\u03c0GN = 1 (where GN is Newton's constant) and the spacetime dimension D \u2261 d + 1 is left unspecified. Besides\nthe standard Einstein-Hilbert term the above Lagrangian contains a dilaton\n(p)\nfield \u03c6 and a number of p-form fields AM1 ***Mp (for p \u2265 0). For simplicity,\nwe consider the case where there is only one dilaton, i.e. n = 1 in the notation of the Introduction. As a convenient common formulation we adopt\nthe Einstein conformal frame and normalize the kinetic term of the dilaton\n\u03c6 with weight one with respect to the Ricci scalar. The Einstein metric gM N\nhas Lorentz signature (\u2212 + * * * +) and is used to lower or raise the indices;\nits determinant is denoted by g. The p-form field strengths F (p) = dA(p) are\nnormalized as\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\nFM1 ***Mp+1 = (p+1)\u2202[M1 AM2 ***Mp+1 ] \u2261 \u2202M1 AM2 ***Mp+1 \u00b1p permutations . (2.2)\nThe dots in the action (2.1) indicate possible modifications of the field\nstrength by additional Yang-Mills or Chapline-Manton-type couplings [13,\n17], such as FC = dC (2) \u2212 C (0) dB (2) for two 2-forms C (2) and B (2) and a\n0-form C (0) , as they occur in type IIB supergravity. Further modifications\ninclude Chern-Simons terms, as in the action for D = 11 supergravity [22].\nThe real parameter \u03bbp measures the strength of the coupling of A(p) to the\ndilaton. When p = 0, we assume that \u03bb0 6= 0 so that there is only one dilaton.\nThis is done mostly for notational convenience. If there were other dilatons\namong the 0-forms, these should be separated off from the p-forms because\nthey play a distinct r\u00f4le. They would define additional spacelike directions\nin the space of the (logarithmic) scale factors and would correspondingly\nincrease the dimension of the relevant hyperbolic billiard.\n(p)\nThe metric gM N , the dilaton field(s) \u03c6 and the p-form fields AM1 ***Mp are\na priori arbitrary functions of both space and time, on which no symmetry conditions are imposed. Nevertheless it will turn out that the evolution\n10\n\n\fequations near the singularity will be asymptotically the same as those of certain homogeneous cosmological models. It is important to keep in mind that\nthis simplification does not follow from imposing extra dimensional reduction\nconditions but emerges as a direct consequence of the general dynamics.\nOur analysis applies both to past and future singularities, and in particular to Schwarzschild-type singularities inside black holes. To follow historical\nusage, we shall assume for definiteness that the spacelike singularity lies in\nthe past, at finite distance in proper time. More specifically, we shall adopt\na space-time slicing such that the singularity \"occurs\" on a constant time\nslice (t = 0 in proper time). The slicing is built by use of pseudo-Gaussian\ncoordinates defined by vanishing lapse N i = 0, with metric\nds2 = \u2212(N(x0 , xi )dx0 )2 + gij (x0 , xi )dxi dxj .\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor simplicity, we shall work in the following with a coordinate spatial coframe dxi , as indicated in Eq. (2.3). However, most of what we say would go\nthrough if we were working in a general time-independent spatial co-frame\n\u03c9 i (xk ) = \u03c9ji (xk )dxj . [The usefulness of using a non-coordinate spatial coframe will show up in the E10 case discussed below.] In order to simplify\nvarious formulas later, we shall find it useful to introduce a rescaled lapse\nfunction\n\u221a\n\u00d1 \u2261 N/ g\n(2.4)\nwhere g \u2261 det gij . [Note the distinction between spacetime quantities gM N , g\nand space ones gij , g. In the following, we work only with the spatial metric\ngij .] We shall see that a useful gauge, within the Hamiltonian approach, is\nthat defined by requiring\n\u00d1 = \u03c12 ,\n(2.5)\nwhere \u03c12 is a quadratic combination of the logarithms of the scale factors\nand the dilaton(s), which we will define below in terms of the Iwasawa decomposition of gij .\nThroughout this paper, we will reserve the label t for the proper time\n\u221a\ndt = \u2212Ndx0 = \u2212\u00d1 gdx0 ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhereas the time coordinate associated with the special gauge Eq.(2.5) will\nbe designated by T , viz.\ndt\n(2.7)\ndT = \u2212 2 \u221a .\n\u03c1 g\n11\n\n\fSometimes, it will also be useful to introduce the \"intermediate\" time coordinate \u03c4 that would correspond to the gauge condition \u00d1 = 1. It is explicitly\ndefined by:\ndt\nd\u03c4 = \u2212 \u221a = \u03c12 dT.\n(2.8)\ng\nAt the singularity the proper time t is assumed to remain finite and to decrease toward 0+ . By contrast, the coordinates T and \u03c4 both increase toward\n+\u221e, as ensured by the minus sign in (2.6). Irrespective of the choice of coordinates, the spatial volume density g is assumed to collapse to zero at each\nspatial point in this limit.\nAs for the p-form fields, we shall assume, throughout this paper, a generalized temporal gauge, viz.\n(p)\n\nA0i2 ***ip = 0\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere small Latin letter i, j, ... denote spatial indices from now on. This\nchoice leaves the freedom of performing time-independent gauge transformations, and therefore fixes the gauge only partially.\n\n3\n\nAsymptotic dynamics in the general case\n\nThe main ingredients of the derivation of the billiard picture are:\n\u2022 use of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian formalism [1] ,\n\u2022 Iwasawa decomposition of the metric, i.e. gij \u2192 (\u03b2 a , N ai ),\n\u2022 decomposition of \u03b2 \u03bc = (\u03b2 a , \u03c6) into radial (\u03c1) and angular (\u03b3 \u03bc ) parts,\nand\n\u2022 use of the pseudo-Gaussian gauge (2.5), i.e. of the time coordinate T\nas the evolution parameter.\nMore explicitly, with the conventions already described before, we assume that in some spacetime patch, the metric is given by (2.3) (pseudoGaussian gauge), such that the local volume g collapses at each spatial point\nas x0 \u2192 +\u221e, in such a way that the proper time t tends to 0+ . We work in\nthe Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian formalism [1], i.e. with first order\n\n12\n\n\fevolution equations in the phase-space of the system. For instance, the gravitational degrees of freedom are initially described by the metric gij and its\nconjugate momentum \u03c0 ij . We systematically use the Iwasawa decomposition\nof the spatial metric gij 3 . Namely, we write\ngij =\n\nd\nX\na=1\n\na\n\ne\u22122\u03b2 N a i N a j\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere N is an upper triangular matrix with 1's on the diagonal, and where\nwe recall that d \u2261 D \u2212 1 denotes the spatial dimension. We shall also need\nthe Iwasawa coframe {\u03b8a }\n\u03b8a = N a i dxi\n(3.2)\n\nas well as the vectorial frame {ea } dual to the coframe {\u03b8a }:\nea = N i a\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the matrix N i a is the inverse of N a i , i.e., N a i N i b = \u03b4ba . It is again an\nupper triangular matrix with 1's on the diagonal.\nThe Iwasawa decomposition allows us to replace the d(d + 1)/2 variables\ngij by the d+d(d\u22121)/2 variables (\u03b2 a , N ai ). Note that (\u03b2 a , N a i ) are ultralocal\nfunctions of gij , that is they depend, at each spacetime point, only on the\nvalue of gij at that point, not on its derivatives. This would not have been\nthe case if we had used a \"Kasner frame\" (i.e. a frame diagonalizing \u03c0ij with\nrespect to gij ) instead of an Iwasawa one. The transformation g \u2192 (\u03b2, N )\nthen defines a corresponding transformation of the conjugate momenta, as\nwe will explain below. We then augment the definition of the \u03b2's by adding\nthe dilaton field, i.e. \u03b2 \u03bc \u2261 (\u03b2 a , \u03c6). The d + n dimensional space of the \u03b2 \u03bc 's\n(where, as we said, we consider only one dilaton, i.e. n = 1) comes equipped\nwith a canonical Lorentzian metric G\u03bc\u03bd defined by\nd\u03c3 2 \u2261 G\u03bc\u03bd d\u03b2 \u03bcd\u03b2 \u03bd \u2261\n\nd\nX\na=1\n\n(d\u03b2 a)2 \u2212 (\n\nd\nX\n\nd\u03b2 a )2 + d\u03c62.\n\n(3.4)\n\na=1\n\nThis (flat) Lorentzian metric in the auxiliary \u03b2-space (of signature \u2212+ . . . +)\nplays an essential role in our study. Note that in models without dilaton\nIf we were working with a non-coordinate spatial co-frame \u03c9 i = \u03c9ji (xk )dxj , we would\nuse the Iwasawa decomposition of the frame components of the spatial metric: dl2 =\ngij \u03c9 i \u03c9 j .\n3\n\n13\n\n\f(such as pure gravity in spacetime dimension d + 1) one has a d-dimensional\nP\n\u03bc\na\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\na 2\nLorentzian\nspace,\nwith\n(\u03b2\n)\n\u2261\n(\u03b2\n)\nand\nmetric\nG\nd\u03b2\nd\u03b2\n=\n\u03bc\u03bd\na (d\u03b2 ) \u2212\nP\n( a d\u03b2 a )2 .\nWe then decompose \u03b2 \u03bc in hyperbolic polar coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b3 \u03bc ), i.e\n\u03b2 \u03bc = \u03c1\u03b3 \u03bc ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03bc are coordinates on the future sheet of the unit hyperboloid4 , which\nare constrained by\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u2261 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3\u03bc = \u22121\n(3.6)\n\nand \u03c1 is the timelike variable\n\n\u03c12 \u2261 \u2212G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd \u2261 \u2212\u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2\u03bc > 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis decomposition naturally introduces the unit hyperboloid (\"\u03b3-space\"),\nsee Fig. 1, which is a realization of the m-dimensional hyperbolic (Lobachevskii) space Hm , with m = d \u2212 1 + n if there are n \u2265 0 dilatons.\nIn terms of the \"polar\" coordinates \u03c1 and \u03b3 \u03bc , the metric in \u03b2-space becomes\nd\u03c3 2 = \u2212d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03a32\n(3.8)\n\nwhere d\u03a32 is the metric on the \u03b3-space Hm .\nNote that \u03c1 is also an ultralocal function of the configuration variables\n(gij , \u03c6). We assume that the hyperbolic coordinate \u03c1 can be used everywhere in a given region of space near the singularity as a well-defined (real)\nquantity which tends to +\u221e as we approach the singularity. We then define the slicing of spacetime by imposing the gauge condition (2.5). The\ntime coordinate corresponding to this gauge is called T as above (see (2.7)).\nOur aim is to study the asymptotic behaviour of all the dynamical variables\n\u03b2(T ), N (T ), ..... as T \u2192 +\u221e (recall that this limit also corresponds to t \u2192 0,\n\u221a\ng \u2192 0, \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e, with \u03b2 \u03bc going to infinity inside the future light cone).\nOf course, we must also ascertain the self-consistency of this limit, which we\nshall refer to as the \"BKL limit\".\n\n3.1\n\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian action\n\nTo focus on the features relevant to the billiard picture, we assume here that\nthere are no Chern-Simons terms or couplings of the exterior form gauge\n4\n\nIndeed, one finds that, near a spacelike singularity \u03b2 \u03bc tends to future timelike infinity.\n\n14\n\n\ffields through a modification of the curvatures F (p) , which are thus taken to\nbe Abelian, F (p) = dA(p) .

Our analysis below\nwill show why it makes sense to group the kinetic terms of both the offdiagonal metric components and the p-forms with the usual potential terms,\ni.e. the term M in (3.10). [Remembering that, in a Kaluza-Klein reduction,\nthe off-diagonal components of the metric in one dimension higher become\na one-form, it is not surprising that it might be useful to group together the\noff-diagonal components and the p-forms.] Thus, we write\n\n5\n\nH = H0 + V\n\n(3.22)\n\nWe use the term \"Hamiltonian density\" to denote both H and H. Note that H is a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nusual spatial density (of weight 1, i.e. the same weight as g), while H \u2261 gH/N is a\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\ndensity of weight 2 (like g = ( g) ).

The reason\nwhy this separation is useful is that, as we are going to show, in the BKL\nlimit, and in the special Iwasawa decomposition which we have adopted, the\nasymptotic dynamics is governed by the scale factors \u03b2 \u03bc , whereas all other\nvariables \"freeze\". Thus, in the asymptotic limit, we have schematically\n\u0011\n\u0010\nj1 ***jp\n(p)\n\u03bc\na\ni\n(3.33)\nV \u03b2 , N i , P a , Aj1 ***jp , \u03c0(p) , . . . \u2212\u2192 V\u221e (\u03b3 \u03bc )\nwhere V\u221e (\u03b3 \u03bc ) stands for a sum of certain \"sharp wall potentials\" which\ndepend only on the angular hyperbolic coordinates \u03b3 \u03bc \u2261 \u03b2 \u03bc /\u03c1. As a consequence, the asymptotic dynamics can be described as a \"billiard\" in the\nhyperbolic space of the \u03b3 \u03bc 's, whose walls (or \"cushions\") are determined by\nthe energy of the fields that are asymptotically frozen.\nThis reduction of the complicated potential to a much simpler \"effective\npotential\" V\u221e (\u03b3 \u03bc ) follows essentially from the exponential dependence of\nV on the diagonal Iwasawa variables \u03b2 \u03bc , from its independence from the\nconjugate momenta of the \u03b2's, and from the fact that the radial magnitude\n\u03c1 of the \u03b2's becomes infinitely large in the BKL limit.\nTo see the essence of this reduction, with a minimum of technical complications, let us consider a potential density (of weight 2) of the general\nform\nX\nV(\u03b2, Q, P ) =\ncA (Q, P ) exp ( \u2212 2wA (\u03b2))\n(3.34)\nA\n\nwhere (Q, P ) denote the remaining phase space variables (that is, other than\n(\u03b2, \u03c0\u03b2 )). Here wA (\u03b2) = wA\u03bc \u03b2 \u03bc are certain linear forms which depend only\non the (extended) scale factors, and whose precise form will be derived in\nthe following section. Similarly we shall discuss below the explicit form of\nthe pre-factors cA , which will be some complicated polynomial functions of\nthe remaining fields, i.e. the off-diagonal components of the metric, the pform fields and their respective conjugate momenta, and of some of their\nspatial gradients. The fact that the wA (\u03b2) depend linearly on the scale\nfactors \u03b2 \u03bc is an important property of the models under consideration. A\n18\n\n\fsecond non-trivial fact is that, for the leading contributions, the pre-factors\nare always non-negative, i.e. cleading\n\u2265 0. Since the values of the fields for\nA\nwhich cA = 0 constitute a set of measure zero, we will usually make the\n\"genericity assumption\" cA > 0 for the leading terms in the potential V 6 .\nThe third fact following from the detailed analysis of the walls that we shall\nexploit is that all the leading walls are timelike, i.e. their normal vectors (in\nthe Minkowski \u03b2-space) are spacelike.\nWhen parametrizing \u03b2 \u03bc in terms of \u03c1 and \u03b3 \u03bc , or equivalently\n\u03bb \u2261 ln \u03c1 \u2261 12 ln ( \u2212 G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd )\n\n(3.35)\n\n(with conjugate momentum \u03c0\u03bb ), and \u03b3 \u03bc , the part of the Hamiltonian describing the kinetic energy of the \u03b2's, H0 = \u00d1H0 , takes the form\nH0 =\n\n\u0003\n\u00d1 \u0002 2\n2\n\u2212\u03c0\n+\n\u03c0\n.\n\u03bb\n\u03b3\n4\u03c12\n\n(3.36)\n\nChoosing the gauge (2.5) to simplify the kinetic terms H0 we end up with an\nHamiltonian of the form\nH(\u03bb, \u03c0\u03bb , \u03b3, \u03c0\u03b3 , Q, P ) = \u00d1H\n(3.37)\nX\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n=\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bb + \u03c0\u03b32 + \u03c12\ncA (Q, P ) exp ( \u2212 \u03c1wA (\u03b3))\n4\nA\n\nwhere \u03c0\u03b32 is the kinetic energy of a particle moving on Hm . In (3.37) and\nbelow we shall regard \u03bb as a primary dynamical variable (so that \u03c1 \u2261 e\u03bb ).\nThe essential point is now that, in the BKL limit, \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e i.e. \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e,\neach term \u03c12 exp ( \u2212 2\u03c1wA (\u03b3)) becomes a sharp wall potential, i.e. a function\nof wA (\u03b3) which is zero when wA (\u03b3) > 0, and +\u221e when wA (\u03b3) < 0. To\nformalize this behaviour we define the sharp wall \u0398-function7 as\n\u001a\n0\nif x < 0\n\u0398(x) :=\n(3.38)\n+\u221e if x > 0\nA basic formal property of this \u0398-function is its invariance under multiplication by a positive quantity. With the above assumption checked below that\n6\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction understanding the effects of the possible failure of\nthis assumption is one of the subtle issues in establishing a rigorous proof of the BKL\npicture.\n7\nOne should more properly write \u0398\u221e (x), but since this is the only step function encountered in this article, we use the simpler notation \u0398(x).\n\n19\n\n\fall the relevant prefactors cA (Q, P ) are positive near each leading wall, we\ncan formally write\nh\ni\nlim cA (Q, P )\u03c12 exp ( \u2212 \u03c1wA (\u03b3) = cA (Q, P )\u0398( \u2212 2wA (\u03b3)) \u2261 \u0398( \u2212 2wA (\u03b3)).\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.39)\nOf course, \u0398(\u22122wA (\u03b3)) = \u0398(\u2212wA (\u03b3)), but we shall keep the extra factor of 2\nto recall that the arguments of the exponentials, from which the \u0398-functions\noriginate, come with a well-defined normalization. Therefore, the limiting\nHamiltonian density reads\n\u0003 X\n1\u0002 2\nH\u221e (\u03bb, \u03c0\u03bb , \u03b3, \u03c0\u03b3 , Q, P ) =\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bb + \u03c0\u03b32 +\n(3.40)\n\u0398( \u2212 2wA\u2032 (\u03b3)),\n4\n\u2032\nA\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere A runs over the dominant walls. The set of dominant walls is defined\nas the minimal set of wall forms which suffice to define the billiard table, i.e.\nsuch that the restricted set of inequalities {wA\u2032 (\u03b3) \u2265 0} imply the full set\n{wA (\u03b3) \u2265 0}. The concept of dominant wall will be illustrated below. [Note\nthat the concept of \"dominant\" wall is a refinement of the distinction, which\nwill also enter our discussion, between a leading wall and a subleading one.]\nThe crucial point is that the limiting Hamiltonian (3.40) no longer depends on \u03bb, Q and P . Therefore the Hamiltonian equations of motion for\n\u03bb, Q and P tell us that the corresponding conjugate momenta, i.e. \u03c0\u03bb , P and\nQ, respectively, all become constants of the motion in the limit \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e.\nThe total Hamiltonian density H\u221e is also a constant of the motion (which\nmust be set to zero). The variable \u03bb evolves according to d\u03bb/dT = \u2212 12 \u03c0\u03bb .\nHence, in the limit, \u03bb is a linear function of T . The only non-trivial dynamics\nresides in the evolution of (\u03b3, \u03c0\u03b3 ) which reduces to the sum of a free (non\nrelativistic) kinetic term \u03c0\u03b32 /4 and a sum of sharp wall potentials, such that\nthe resulting motion of the \u03b3's indeed constitutes a billiard, with geodesic\nmotion on the unit hyperboloid Hm interrupted by reflections on the walls\ndefined by wA (\u03b3) = 0. These walls are hyperplanes (in the sense of hyperbolic geometry) because they are geometrically given by the intersection of\nthe unit hyperboloid \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2\u03bc = \u22121 with the usual Minkowskian hyperplanes\nwA (\u03b2) = 0.\nSee Appendix A of [29] for the study of a toy model which shows in\nmore detail how the asymptotic constancy of the \"off diagonal\" phase-space\nvariables (Q, P ) arises.\nGeodesic motion in a billiard in hyperbolic space has been much studied.\nIt is known that this motion is chaotic or non-chaotic depending on whether\n20\n\n\fthe billiard has finite or infinite volume [62, 42, 72, 37]. In the finite volume\ncase, the generic evolution exhibits an infinite number of collisions with the\nwalls with strong chaotic features (\"oscillating behavior\").\nBy contrast, if the billiard has infinite volume, the evolution is nonchaotic. For a generic evolution, there are only finitely many collisions with\nthe walls. The system generically settles after a finite time in a Kasner-like\nmotion that lasts all the way to the singularity, see Fig. 1.\nThe above derivation relied on the use of hyperbolic polar coordinates\n(\u03c1, \u03b3). This use is technically useful in that it represents the walls as being located at an asymptotically fixed position in hyperbolic space, namely\nwA (\u03b3) = 0. However, once one has derived the final result (3.40), one\ncan reexpress it in terms of the original variables \u03b2 \u03bc , which run over a linear (Minkowski) space. Owing to the linearity of wA (\u03b2) = \u03c1wA (\u03b3) in this\nMinkowskian picture, the asymptotic motion takes place in a \"polywedge\",\nbounded by the hyperplanes wA (\u03b2) = 0. The billiard motion then consists\nof free motions of \u03b2 \u03bc on straight lightlike lines within this polywedge, which\nare interrupted by specular reflections off the walls. [See formula (5.3) below\nfor the explicit effect of these reflections on the components of the velocity\nvector of the \u03b2-particle.] Indeed, when going back to \u03b2-space (i.e. before\ntaking the BKL limit), the dynamics of the scale factors at each point of\nspace is given by the Hamiltonian\n\"\n#\nX\nH(\u03b2 \u03bc , \u03c0\u03bc ) = \u00d1 H = \u00d1 14 G\u03bc\u03bd \u03c0\u03bc \u03c0\u03bd +\ncA exp ( \u2212 2wA (\u03b2)) .\n(3.41)\nA\n\nThe \u03b2-space dynamics simplifies in the gauge \u00d1 = 1, corresponding to the\ntime coordinate \u03c4 . In the BKL limit, the Hamiltonian (3.41) takes the limiting form (in the gauge \u00d1 = 1)\nX\n(3.42)\n\u0398( \u2212 2wA\u2032 (\u03b2))\nH\u221e (\u03b2 \u03bc , \u03c0\u03bc ) = 41 G\u03bc\u03bd \u03c0\u03bc \u03c0\u03bd +\nA\u2032\n\nwhere the sum is again only over the dominant walls. When taking \"equal\ntime\" slices of this polywedge (e.g., slices on which \u03a3i \u03b2 i is constant), it is\nclear that with increasing time (i.e increasing \u03a3i \u03b2 i , or increasing \u03c4 or \u03c1) the\nwalls recede from the observer. The \u03b2-space picture is useful for simplifying\nthe mathematical representation of the dynamics of the scale factors which\ntakes place in a linear space. However, it is inconvenient both for proving\n21\n\n\fthat the exponential walls of (3.41) do reduce, in the large \u03a3i \u03b2 i limit to\nsharp walls, and for dealing with the dynamics of the other phase-space\nvariables (Q, P ), whose appearance in the coefficients cA has been suppressed\nin (3.41) above. Let us only mention that, in order to prove, in this picture,\nthe freezing of the phase space variables (Q, P ) one must consider in detail\nthe accumulation of the \"redshifts\" of the energy-momentum \u03c0\u03bc of the \u03b2particle when it undergoes reflections on the receding walls, and the effect\nof the resulting decrease of the magnitudes of the components of \u03c0\u03bc on the\nevolution of (Q, P ). By contrast, the \u03b3-space picture that we used above\nallows for a more streamlined treatment of the effect of the limit \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e\non the sharpening of the walls and on the freezing of (Q, P ).\nIn summary, the dynamics simplifies enormously in the asymptotic limit.\nIt becomes ultralocal in that it reduces to a continuous superposition of\nevolution systems (depending only on a time parameter) for the scale factors\nand the dilatons, at each spatial point, with asymptotic freezing of the offdiagonal and p-form variables. This ultralocal description of the dynamics\nis valid only asymptotically. It would make no sense to speak of a billiard\nmotion prior to this limit, because one cannot replace the exponentials by\n\u0398-functions. Prior to this limit, the evolution system for the scale factors\ninvolves the coefficients in front of the exponential terms, and the evolution\nof these coefficients depends on various spatial gradients of the other degrees\nof freedom. However, one may contemplate setting up an expansion in which\nthe sharp wall model is replaced by a model with exponential (\"Toda-like\")\npotentials, and where the evolution of the quantities entering the coefficients\nof these \"Toda walls\" is treated as a next to leading effect. See [28] and below\nfor the definition of the first steps of such an expansion scheme for maximal\nsupergravity in eleven dimensions.\n\n3.3\n\nConstraints\n\nWe have just seen that in the BKL limit, the evolution equations become\nordinary differential equations with respect to time. Although the spatial\npoints are decoupled in the evolution equations, they are, however, still coupled via the constraints. These constraints just restrict the initial data and\nneed only be imposed at one time, since they are preserved by the dynamical\nequations of motion. Indeed, one easily finds that, in the BKL limit,\n\u1e22 = 0\n22\n\n(3.43)\n\n\fsince [H(x), H(x\u2032 )] = 0 in the ultralocal limit. This corresponds simply to\nthe fact that the collisions preserve the lightlike character of the velocity\nvector. Furthermore, the gauge constraints (3.16) are also preserved in time\nsince the Hamiltonian constraint is gauge-invariant. In the BKL limit, the\nmomentum constraint fulfills\n\u1e22k (x) = \u2202k H \u2248 0.\n\n(3.44)\n\nIt is important that the restrictions on the initial data do not bring dangerous\nconstraints on the coefficients of the walls in the sense that these may all take\nnon-zero values. For instance, it is well known that it is consistent with the\nGauss law to take non-vanishing electric and magnetic energy densities; thus\nthe coefficients of the electric and magnetic walls are indeed generically nonvanishing. In fact, the constraints are essentially conditions on the spatial\ngradients of the variables entering the wall coefficients, not on these variables\nthemselves. In some non-generic contexts, however, the constraints could\nforce some of the wall coefficients to be zero; the corresponding walls would\nthus be absent. [E.g., for vacuum gravity in four dimensions, the momentum\nconstraints for some Bianchi homogeneous models force some symmetry wall\ncoefficients to vanish. But this is peculiar to the homogeneous case.]\nIt is easy to see that the number of arbitrary physical functions involved\nin the solution of the asymptotic BKL equations of motion is the same as\nin the general solution of the complete Einstein-matter equations. Indeed,\nthe number of constraints on the initial data and the residual gauge freedom\nare the same in both cases. Further discussion of the constraints in the BKL\ncontext may be found in [2, 30].\n\n3.4\n\nConsistency of BKL behaviour in spite of the increase of spatial gradients\n\nThe essential assumption in the BKL analysis is the asymptotic dominance of\ntime derivatives with respect to space derivatives near a spacelike singularity.\nThis assumption has been mathematically justified, in a rigorous manner, in\nthe cases where the billiard is of infinite volume, i.e. in the (simple) cases\nwhere the asymptotic behaviour is not chaotic, but is monotonically Kasnerlike [2, 30].\nOn the other hand, one might a priori worry that this assumption is\nself-contradictory in those cases where the billiard is of finite volume, when\n23\n\n\fthe asymptotic behaviour is chaotic, with an infinite number of oscillations.\nIndeed, it has been pointed out [55, 6] that the independence of the billiard\nevolution at each spatial point will have the effect of infinitely increasing\nthe spatial gradients of various quantities, notably of the local values of the\nKasner exponents p\u03bc (x). This increase of spatial gradients towards the singularity has been described as a kind of turbulent behaviour of the gravitational\nfield, in which energy is pumped into shorter and shorter length scales [55, 6],\nand, if it were too violent, it would certainly work against the validity of the\nBKL assumption of asymptotic dominance of time derivatives. For instance,\nin our analysis of gravitational walls in the following section, we will encounter subleading walls, whose prefactors depend on spatial gradients of\nthe logarithmic scale factors \u03b2.\nTo address the question of consistency of the BKL assumption we need to\nknow how fast the spatial gradients of \u03b2, and of similar quantities entering\nthe prefactors, grow near the singularity. We refer to [29] for a discussion\nof this issue. The result is that the chaotic character of the billiard indeed\nimplies an unlimited growth of the spatial gradients of \u03b2, but that this growth\nis only of polynomial order in \u03c1\n\u2202i \u03b2 = O(1)\u03c12 ,\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere the coefficient O(1) is a chaotically oscillating quantity. This polynomial growth of \u2202i \u03b2 (and of its second-order spatial derivatives) entails a\npolynomial growth of the prefactors of the sub-dominant walls. Because it\nis polynomial (in \u03c1), this growth is, however, negligible compared to the\nexponential (in \u03c1) behaviour of the various potential terms. It does not\njeopardize our reasoning based on keeping track of the various exponential\nbehaviours. As we will see the potentially dangerously growing terms that\nwe have controlled here appear only in subdominant walls. The reasoning\nof the Appendix of [29] shows that the prefactors of the dominant walls are\nself-consistently predicted to evolve very little near the singularity.\nWe conclude that the unlimited growth of some of the spatial gradients\ndoes not affect the consistency of the BKL analysis done here. This does\nnot mean, however, that it will be easy to promote our analysis to a rigorous\nmathematical proof. The main obstacle to such a proof appears to be the\nexistence of exceptional points, where a prefactor of a dominant wall happens\nto vanish, or points where a subdominant wall happens to be comparable to\na dominant one. Though the set of such exceptional points is (generically)\n24\n\n\fof measure zero, their density might increase near the singularity because of\nthe increasing spatial gradients. This situation might be compared to the\nKAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) one, where the \"bad\" tori have a small\nmeasure, but are interspersed densely among the \"good\" ones.\n\n4\n\nWalls\n\nThe decomposition (3.22) of the Hamiltonian gives rise to different types\nof walls, which we now discuss in turn. Specifically, we will derive explicit\nformulas for the linear forms wA (\u03b2) and the field dependence of the prefactors cA entering the various potentials.\n\n4.1\n\nSymmetry walls\n\nWe start by analyzing the effects of the off-diagonal metric components which\nwill give rise to the so-called \"symmetry walls\". As they originate from the\ngravitational action they are always present. The relevant contributions to\nthe potential is the centrifugal potential (3.27). When comparing (3.27) to\nthe general form (3.34) analyzed above, we see that firstly the summation\nindex A must be interpreted as a double index (a, b), with the restriction\na < b, secondly that the corresponding prefactor is cab = (P j a N b j )2 is automatically non-negative (in accordance with our genericity assumptions, we\nshall assume cab > 0). The centrifugal wall forms read:\nS\nS\nw(ab)\n(\u03b2) \u2261 w(ab)\u03bc\n\u03b2 \u03bc \u2261 \u03b2 b \u2212 \u03b2 a (a < b).\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe refer to these wall forms as the \"symmetry walls\" for the following reason.\nWhen applying the general collision law (5.3) derived below to the case of the\ncollision on the wall (4.1) one easily finds that its effect on the components of\nthe velocity vector v \u03bc is simply to permute the components v a and v b , while\nleaving unchanged the other components \u03bc 6= a, b.\nS\nThe hyperplanes w(ab)\n(\u03b2) = 0 (i.e. the symmetry walls) are timelike since\nS\nS\nG\u03bc\u03bd w(ab)\u03bc\nw(ab)\u03bd\n= +2.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis P\nensures that the symmetry walls intersect the hyperboloid G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd =\na\n\u22121,\na \u03b2 \u2265 0. The symmetry billiard (in \u03b2-space) is defined to be the\nregion of Minkowski space determined by the inequalities\nS\nw(ab)\n(\u03b2) \u2265 0,\n\n25\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fP\nwith a \u03b2 a \u2265 0 (i.e. by the region of \u03b2-space where the \u0398 functions are\nzero). Its projection on the hyperbolic space Hm is defined by the inequalities\nS\nw(ab)\n(\u03b3) \u2265 0.\nThe explicit expressions above of the symmetry wall forms also allow us\nto illustrate the notion of a \"dominant wall\" defined above. Indeed, the\nd(d \u2212 1)/2 inequalities (4.3) already follow from the following minimal set of\nd \u2212 1 inequalities\n\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b2 1 \u2265 0, \u03b2 3 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u2265 0, * * * , \u03b2 d \u2212 \u03b2 d\u22121 \u2265 0.\n\n(4.4)\n\nMore precisely, each linear form which must be positive in (4.3) can be written\nas a linear combination, with positive (in fact, integer) coefficients of the\nlinear forms entering the subset (4.4). For instance, \u03b2 3 \u2212\u03b2 1 = (\u03b2 3 \u2212\u03b2 2 )+(\u03b2 2 \u2212\n\u03b2 1 ), etc. As discussed in [29] this result can be reinterpreted by identifying\nthe dominant linear forms entering (4.4) with the simple roots of SL(n, R).\n\n4.2\n\nCurvature (gravitational) walls\n\nNext we analyze the gravitational potential, which requires a computation\nof curvature. To that end, one must explicitly express the spatial curvature\nin terms of the scale factors and the off-diagonal variables N a i . Again, the\ncalculation is most easily done in the Iwasawa frame (3.2). We use the shorta\nhand notation Aa \u2261 e\u2212\u03b2 for the (Iwasawa) scale factors. Let C abc (x) be the\nstructure functions of the Iwasawa basis {\u03b8a }, viz.\n1\nd\u03b8a = \u2212 C abc \u03b8b \u2227 \u03b8c\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere d is the spatial exterior differential. The structure functions obviously\ndepend only on the off-diagonal components N a i , but not on the scale factors.\nUsing the Cartan formulas for the connection one-form \u03c9 ab ,\nX\n\u03c9 ab \u2227 \u03b8b = 0\n(4.6)\nd\u03b8a +\nb\n\nd\u03b3ab = \u03c9ab + \u03c9ba\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03c9ab \u2261 \u03b3ac \u03c9 c b , and\n\u03b3ab = \u03b4ab A2a \u2261 exp(\u22122\u03b2 a )\u03b4ab\n26\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fis the metric in the frame {\u03b8a }, one finds\n\u0013\n2\n2\n2\nX1\u0012\nc\nb Ab\nd Ad\nc Ac\n\u03c9d =\nC cd 2 + C cb 2 \u2212 C db 2 \u03b8b\n2\nAc\nAc\nAd\nb\ni\nX 1 h\n2\n2\n2\nb\n\u03b4\n(A\n)\n+\n\u03b4\n(A\n)\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n(A\n)\n+\ncd\ncb\ndb\nc ,b\nc ,d\nd ,c \u03b8 .\n2\n2A\nc\nb\n\n(4.9)\n\nIn the last bracket above, the commas denote the frame derivatives \u2202a \u2261\nN i a \u2202i .\nThe Riemann tensor Rc def , the Ricci tensor Rde and the scalar curvature\nR are obtained through\nX\n\u03a9ab = d\u03c9 ab +\n\u03c9 ac \u2227 \u03c9 c b\n(4.10)\nc\n\n=\n\n1X\n2\n\ne,f\n\nRabef \u03b8e \u2227 \u03b8f\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere \u03a9ab is the curvature 2-form and\nRab =\n\nX\n\nRc acb ,\n\nR=\n\nc\n\nX 1\nR .\n2 aa\nA\na\na\n\n(4.12)\n\nDirect, but somewhat cumbersome, computations yield\nR=\u2212\n\nX 1\n1 X A2a\n(C abc )2 +\nF (\u2202 2 \u03b2, \u2202\u03b2, \u2202C, C)\n2 2\n2 a\n4 a,b,c Ab Ac\nA\na\na\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere Fa is some complicated function of its arguments whose explicit form\nwill not be needed here. The only property of Fa that will be of importance is\nthat it is a polynomial of degree two in the derivatives \u2202\u03b2 and of degree one\nin \u2202 2 \u03b2. Thus, the exponential dependence on the \u03b2's which determines the\nasymptotic behaviour in the BKL limit, occurs only through the A2a -terms\nwritten explicitly in (4.13).\nIn (4.13) one obviously has b 6= c because the structure functions C abc are\nantisymmetric in the pair [bc]. In addition to this restriction, we can assume,\nwithout loss of generality, that a 6= b, c in the first sum on the right-hand side\nof (4.13). Indeed, the terms with either a = b or a = c can be absorbed into\n\n27\n\n\fa redefinition of Fa . We can thus write the gravitational potential density\n(of weight 2) as\nVG \u2261 \u2212gR =\n\n1 X\u2032 \u22122\u03b1abc (\u03b2) a 2 X \u22122\u03bca (\u03b2)\ne\n(C bc ) \u2212\ne\nFa\n4 a,b,c\na\n\n(4.14)\n\nP\nwhere the prime on\nindicates that the sum is to be performed only over\nunequal indices, i.e. a 6= b, b 6= c, c 6= a, and where the linear forms \u03b1abc (\u03b2)\nand \u03bca (\u03b2) are given by\nX\n\u03b1abc (\u03b2) = 2\u03b2 a +\n\u03b2e\n(a 6= b , b 6= c , c 6= a)\n(4.15)\ne6=a,b,c\n\nand\n\u03bca (\u03b2) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b2c\n\n(4.16)\n\nc6=a\n\nrespectively. Note that \u03b1abc is symmetric under the exchange of b with c, but\nthat the index a plays a special role.\nComparing the result (4.14) to the general form (3.34) we see that there\nare, a priori, two types of gravitational walls: the \u03b1-type and the \u03bc-type. It\nis shown in [29] that the \u03b1-walls dominate the \u03bc-walls and, more precisely\nthat \u03bca (\u03b2) \u2265 0 within the entire future light cone of the \u03b2's. [The proof uses\nthe fact that each linear form \u03bca (\u03b2) is lightlike.]\nFrom these considerations we deduce the additional constraints\n\u03b1abc (\u03b2) \u2265 0\n\n(D > 3)\n\n(4.17)\n\nbesides the symmetry inequalities (4.4). The hyperplanes \u03b1abc (\u03b2) = 0 are\ncalled the \"curvature\" or \"gravitational\" walls. Like the symmetry walls,\nthey are timelike since\nG\u03bc\u03bd (\u03b1abc )\u03bc (\u03b1abc )\u03bd = +2.\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe restriction D > 3 is due to the fact that in D = 3 spacetime dimensions,\nthe gravitational walls \u03b1abc (\u03b2) = 0 are absent, simply because one cannot find\nthree distinct spatial indices. This is, of course, in agreement with expectations, because gravity in three spacetime dimensions has no propagating\ndegrees of freedom (gravitational waves).\n\n28\n\n\f4.3\n\np-form walls\n\nWhile none of the wall forms considered so far involved the dilatons, the\nelectric and magnetic ones do as we shall now show. To make the notation\nless cumbersome we will omit the super-(or sub-)script (p) on the p-form\nfields in this subsection.\n4.3.1\n\nElectric walls\n\nThe electric potential density can be written as\nel\nV(p)\n=\n\nX\n1\ne\u22122ea1 ***ap (\u03b2) (E a1 ***ap )2\n2 p! a ,a ,***,a\n1\n\n2\n\n(4.19)\n\np\n\nwhere E a1 ***ap are the components of the electric field \u03c0 i1 ***ip in the basis {\u03b8a }\nE a1 ***ap \u2261 N a1 j1 N a2 j2 * * * N ap jp \u03c0 j1 ***jp\n\n(4.20)\n\n(recall our summation conventions for spatial cordinate indices) and where\nea1 ***ap (\u03b2) are the electric wall forms8\nea1 ***ap (\u03b2) = \u03b2 a1 + * * * + \u03b2 ap +\n\n\u03bbp\n\u03c6.\n2\n\n(4.21)\n\nHere the indices aj 's are all distinct because E a1 ***ap is completely antisymmetric. The variables E a1 ***ap do not depend on the \u03b2 \u03bc . It is thus rather easy\nto take the BKL limit. The exponentials in (4.19) are multiplied by positive\nfactors which generically are different from zero. Thus, in the BKL limit,\nel\nV(p)\nbecomes\nX\nel\nV(p)\n\u2243\n(4.22)\n\u0398[\u22122ea1 ***ap (\u03b2)].\na1 <a2 <***<ap\n\nThe transformation from the variables (N a i , P i a , Aj1 ***jp , \u03c0 j1 ***jp ) to the variables (N a i , P i a , Aa1 ***ap , E a1 ***ap ) is a point canonical transformation whose\nexplicit form is obtained from\nX\na\n\n8\n\nP i a N \u0307 a i +\n\nX\nX X 1\nX 1\nP i a N \u0307 a i +\n\u03c0 j1 ***jp \u0226j1 ***jp =\nE a1 ***ap \u0226a1 ***ap .\np!\np!\na\np a ,...,a\np\n1\n\np\n\n(4.23)\n\nA sign error in the last term \u221d \u03bbp crept in the corresponding equation of [29].\n\n29\n\n\fThe new momenta P i a conjugate to N a i differ from the old ones P i a by\nterms involving E, N and A since the components Aa1 ***ap of the p-forms in\nthe basis {\u03b8a } depend on the N 's,\nAa1 ***ap = N j1 a1 * * * N jp ap Aj1 ***jp .\nHowever, it is easy to see that these extra terms do not affect the symmetry\nwalls in the BKL limit.\n4.3.2\n\nMagnetic walls\n\nThe magnetic potential is dealt with similarly. Expressing it in the {\u03b8a }frame, one obtains\nX\n1\nmagn\nV(p)\n=\n(4.24)\ne\u22122ma1 ***ap+1 (\u03b2) (Fa1 ***ap+1 )2\n2 (p + 1)! a ,a ,***,a\n1\n\n2\n\np+1\n\nwhere Fa1 ***ap+1 are the components of the magnetic field Fm1 ***mp+1 in the\nbasis {\u03b8a },\nFa1 ***ap+1 = N j1 a1 * * * N jp+1 ap+1 Fj1 ***jp+1 .\n(4.25)\n\nThe ma1 ***ap+1 (\u03b2) are the magnetic linear forms9\nX\n\nma1 ***ap+1 (\u03b2) =\n\nb\u2208{a\n/ 1 ,a2 ,***ap+1 }\n\n\u03b2b \u2212\n\n\u03bbp\n\u03c6\n2\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhere again all aj 's are distinct. One sometimes rewrites ma1 ***ap+1 (\u03b2) as\nm\u0303ap+2 ***ad , where {ap+2 , ap+3 , * * * , ad } is the set complementary to\n{a1 , a2 , * * * ap+1 }; e.g.,\nm\u03031 2 *** d\u2212p\u22121 = \u03b2 1 + * * * + \u03b2 d\u2212p\u22121 \u2212\n\n\u03bbp\n\u03c6 = md\u2212p *** d .\n2\n\n(4.27)\n\nOf course, the components of the exterior derivative F of A in the nonholonomic frame {\u03b8a } involves the structure coefficients, i.e. Fa1 ***ap+1 =\n\u2202[a1 Aa2 ***ap+1 ] + CA-terms where \u2202a \u2261 N i a \u2202i is the frame derivative.\nAgain, the BKL limit is quite simple and yields (assuming generic magnetic fields)\nX\nmagn\nV(p)\n\u2243\n\u0398[\u22122m\u0303a1 ***ad\u2212p\u22121 (\u03b2)].\n(4.28)\na1 <***<ad\u2212p\u22121\n\n9\n\nA sign error in the last term \u221d \u03bbp crept in the corresponding equation of [29].\n\n30\n\n\fJust as the off-diagonal variables, the electric and magnetic fields freeze in the\nBKL limit since the Hamiltonian no longer depends on the p-form variables.\nThese drop out because one can rescale the coefficient of any \u0398-function to\nbe one (when it is not zero), thereby absorbing the dependence on the p-form\nvariables.\nThe scale factors are therefore constrained by the further \"billiard\" conditions\n(4.29)\nea1 ***ap (\u03b2) \u2265 0, m\u0303a1 ***ad\u2212p\u22121 (\u03b2) \u2265 0.\nThe hyperplanes ea1 ***ap (\u03b2) = 0 and m\u0303a1 ***ad\u2212p\u22121 (\u03b2) = 0 are called \"electric\"\nand \"magnetic\" walls, respectively. Both walls are timelike because their\ngradients are spacelike, with squared norm\np(d \u2212 p \u2212 1) \u0010 \u03bbp \u00112\n> 0.\n(4.30)\n+\nd\u22121\n2\n\n(For D = 11 supergravity, we have d = 10, p = 3 and \u03bbp = 0 and thus the\nnorm is equal to +2.) This equality explicitly shows the invariance of the\nnorms of the p-form walls under electric-magnetic duality.\n\n4.4\n\nSubleading walls\n\nThe fact that the leading walls originating from the centrifugal, gravitational\nand p-form or are all timelike, is an important ingredient of the overall BKL\npicture. We refer to [29] for a discussion of the other contributions to the\nHamiltonian (including Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills couplings) and for a\nproof that they contribute only subleading walls.\n\n5\n\nEinstein (or cosmological) billiards\n\nLet us summarize the findings above. The dynamics in the vicinity of a\nspacelike singularity is governed by the scale factors, while the other variables (off-diagonal metric components, p-form fields) tend to become mere\n\"spectators\" which get asymptotically frozen. This simple result is most easily derived in terms of the hyperbolic polar coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b3), and in the\ngauge (2.5). In this picture, the essential dynamics is carried by the angular\nvariables \u03b3 which move on a fixed billiard table, with cushions defined by the\ndominant walls wA\u2032 (\u03b3). One can refer to this billiard as being an \"Einstein\nbilliard\" (or a \"cosmological billiard\").\n31\n\n\fIt is often geometrically more illuminating to \"unproject\" the billiard\nmotion in the full Minkowski space of the extended scale factors \u03b2 \u03bc . In that\npicture, the asymptotic evolution of the scale factors at each spatial point\nreduces to a zigzag of null straight lines with respect to the metric G\u03bc\u03bd d\u03b2 \u03bc d\u03b2 \u03bd .\nThe straight segments of this motion are interrupted by collisions against the\nsharp walls\nwA (\u03b2) \u2261 wA\u03bc \u03b2 \u03bc = 0\n(5.1)\ndefined by the symmetry, gravitational and p-form potentials, respectively.\nAs we showed all these walls are timelike, i.e. they have spacelike gradients:\nG\u03bc\u03bd wA\u03bc wA\u03bd > 0.\n\n(5.2)\n\nIndeed, the gradients of the symmetry and gravitational wall forms have\nsquared norm equal to +2, independently of the dimension d. By contrast,\nthe norms of the electric and magnetic gradients, which are likewise positive,\ndepend on the model. As we saw, there also exist subdominant walls, which\ncan be neglected as they are located \"behind\" the dominant walls.\nIn the \u03b2-space picture, the free motion before a collision is described by a\nnull straight line. The effect of a collision on a particular wall wA (\u03b2) is easily\nobtained by solving (3.41), or (3.42), with only one term in the sum. This\ndynamics is exactly integrable: it suffices to decompose the motion of the\n\u03b2-particle into two (linear) components: (i) the component parallel to the\n(timelike) wall hyperplane, and (ii) the orthogonal component. One easily\nfinds that the parallel motion is left unperturbed by the presence of the wall,\nwhile the orthogonal motion suffers a (one-dimensional) reflection, with a\nchange of the sign of the outgoing orthogonal velocity with respect to the\ningoing one. The net effect of the collision on a certain wall w(\u03b2) then is\nto change the ingoing velocity vector v \u03bc = d\u03b2 \u03bc /d\u03c4 entering the ingoing free\nmotion into an outgoing velocity vector v \u2032\u03bc given (in any linear frame) by\nthe usual formula for a geometric reflection in the hyperplane w(\u03b2) = 0:\nv \u2032\u03bc = v \u03bc \u2212 2\n\n(w * v) w \u03bc\n.\n(w * w)\n\n(5.3)\n\nHere, all scalar products, and index raisings, are done with the \u03b2-space metric\nG\u03bc\u03bd . Note that the collision law (5.3) leaves invariant the (Minkowski) length\nof the vector v \u03bc . Because the dominant walls are timelike, the geometric\nreflections that the velocities undergo during a collision, are elements of the\n32\n\n\forthochronous Lorentz group. Each reflection preserves the norm and the\ntime-orientation; hence, the velocity vector remains null and future-oriented.\nFrom this perspective, we can also better understand the relevance of\nwalls which are not timelike. Lightlike walls (like some of the subleading\ngravitational walls) can never cause reflections because in order to hit them\nthe billiard ball would have to move at superluminal speeds in violation of the\nHamiltonian constraint. The effect of spacelike walls (like the cosmological\nconstant wall) is again different: they are either irrelevant (if they are \"behind the motion\"), or otherwise they reverse the time-orientation inducing a\nmotion towards increasing spatial volume (\"bounce\").\nThe hyperbolic billiard is obtained from the \u03b2-space picture by a radial\nprojection onto the unit hyperboloid of the piecewise straight motion in the\npolywedge defined by the walls. The straight motion thereby becomes a\ngeodesic motion on hyperbolic space. The \"cushions\" of the hyperbolic billiard table are the intersections of the hyperplanes (5.1) with the unit hyperboloid, such that the billiard motion is constrained to be in the region\ndefined as the intersection of the half-spaces wA (\u03b2) \u2265 0 with the unit hyperboloid. As we already emphasized, not all walls are relevant since some of the\ninequalities wA (\u03b2) \u2265 0 are implied by others [26]. Only the dominant wall\nforms, in terms of which all the other wall forms can be expressed as linear\ncombinations with non-negative coefficients, are relevant for determining the\nbilliard. Usually, these are the minimal symmetry walls and some of the pform walls. The billiard region, as a subset of hyperbolic space, is in general\nnon-compact because the cushions meet at infinity (i.e. at a cusp); in terms\nof the original scale factor variables \u03b2, this means that the corresponding\nhyperplanes intersect on the lightcone. It is important that, even when the\nbilliard is non-compact, the hyperbolic region can have finite volume.\nGiven the action (2.1) with definite spacetime dimension, menu of fields\nand dilaton couplings, one can determine the relevant wall forms and compute\nthe billiards. For generic initial conditions, we have the following results, as\nto which of the models (2.1) exhibit oscillatory behaviour (finite volume\nbilliard) or Kasner-like behaviour (infinite volume billiard)\n\u2022 Pure gravity billiards have finite volume for spacetime dimension D \u2264\n10 and infinite volume for spacetime dimension D \u2265 11 [34]. This\ncan be understood in terms of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra AEd\n[27]: as shown there, the system is chaotic precisely if the underlying\nindefinite Kac-Moody algebra is hyperbolic.\n33\n\n\f\u2022 The billiard of gravity coupled to a dilaton always has infinite volume,\nhence exhibits Kasner-like behavior [7, 2, 30].\n\u2022 If gravity is coupled to p-forms (with p 6= 0 and p < D \u2212 2) without a dilaton the corresponding billiard has a finite volume [25]. The\nmost prominent example in this class is D = 11 supergravity, whereas\nvacuum gravity in 11 dimensions is Kasner-like. The 3-form is crucial\nfor closing the billiard. Similarly, the Einstein-Maxwell system in four\n(in fact any number of) dimensions has a finite-volume billiard (see\n[48, 59, 70] for a discussion of four-dimensional homogeneous models\nwith Maxwell fields exhibiting oscillatory behaviour).\n\u2022 The volume of the mixed Einstein-dilaton-p-form system depends on\nthe dilaton couplings. For a given spacetime dimension D and a given\nmenu of p-forms there exists a subcritical open domain D in the space of\nthe dilaton couplings, i.e. an open neighbourhood of the origin \u03bbp = 0\nsuch that: (i) when the dilaton couplings \u03bbp belong to D the general\nbehaviour is Kasner-like, but (ii) when the \u03bbp do not belong to D\nthe behaviour is oscillatory [24, 30]. For all the superstring models,\nthe dilaton couplings do not belong to the subcritical domain and the\nbilliard has finite volume. Note, however, that the superstring dilaton\ncouplings are precisely \"critical\", i.e. on the borderline between the\nsubcritical and the overcritical domain.\nAs a note of caution let us point out that some indicators of chaos must\nbe used with care in general relativity, because of reparametrization invariance, and in particular redefinitions of the time coordinate; see [20, 43] for a\ndiscussion of the original Bianchi IX model. In this respect, we refer to [29]\nfor a discussion of the link between the various time coordinates used in the\nanalysis above: t, \u03c4 and T .\nThe hyperbolic billiard description of the (3+1)-dimensional homogeneous Bianchi IX system was first worked out by Chitre [19] and Misner\n[64]. It was subsequently generalized to inhomogeneous metrics in [54, 45].\nThe extension to higher dimensions with perfect fluid sources was considered\nin [56], without symmetry walls. Exterior p-form sources were investigated in\n[46, 47] for special classes of metric and p-form configurations. The uniform\napproach (based on the Iwasawa decomposition) summarized above comes\nfrom [29].\n\n34\n\n\f6\n\nKac-Moody theoretic formulation: the E10\ncase\n\nAlthough the billiard description holds for all systems governed by the action (2.1), the billiard in general has no notable regularity property. In\nparticular, the dihedral angles between the faces, which can depend on the\n(continuous) dilaton couplings, need not be integer submultiples of \u03c0. In\nsome instances, however, the billiard can be identified with the fundamental\nWeyl chamber of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody (or KM) algebra of indefinite type10 , with Lorentzian signature metric [26, 27, 23]. Such billiards are\ncalled \"Kac-Moody billiards\". More specifically, in [26], superstring models\nwere considered and the rank 10 KM algebras E10 and BE10 were shown to\nemerge, in line with earlier conjectures made in [50, 51]11 . This result was\nfurther extended to pure gravity in any number of spacetime dimensions, for\nwhich the relevant KM algebra is AEd , and it was understood that chaos\n(finite volume of the billiard) is equivalent to hyperbolicity of the underlying\nKac-Moody algebra [27]. For pure gravity in D = 4 the relevant algebra\nis the hyperbolic algebra AE3 first investigated in [38]. Further examples\nof emergence of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras, based on the models of\n[15, 21], are given in [23]. See also [32] and [40].\nThe main feature of the gravitational billiards that can be associated\nwith KM algebras is that there exists a group theoretical interpretation of\nthe billiard motion: the asymptotic BKL dynamics is equivalent (in a sense to\nbe made precise below), at each spatial point, to the asymptotic dynamics of\na one-dimensional nonlinear \u03c3-model based on a certain infinite dimensional\ncoset space G/K, where the KM group G and its maximal compact subgroup\nK depend on the specific model. As we have seen, the walls that determine\nthe billiards are the dominant walls. For KM billiards, they correspond\nto the simple roots of the KM algebra. As we discuss below, some of the\nsubdominant walls also have an algebraic interpretation in terms of higherheight positive roots. This enables one to go beyond the BKL limit and to\nsee the beginnings of a possible identification of the dynamics of the scale\nfactors and of all the remaining variables with that of a non-linear \u03c3-model\n10\n\nThroughout this section, we will use the abbreviations \"KM\" for \"Kac-Moody\", and\n\"CSA\" for Cartan subalgebra.\n11\nNote that the Weyl groups of the E-family have been discussed in a similar vein in\nthe context of U -duality [61, 65, 3].\n\n35\n\n\fdefined on the cosets of the Kac-Moody group divided its maximal compact\nsubgroup [28, 29].\nThe KM theoretic reformulation not only enables us to give a unified\ngroup theoretical derivation of the different types of walls discussed in the\npreceding section, but also shows that the \u03b2-space of logarithmic scale factors,\nin which the billard motion takes place, can be identified with the Cartan\nsubalgebra of the underlying indefinite Kac-Moody algebra. The various types\nof walls can thus be understood directly as arising from the large field limit of\nthe corresponding \u03c3-models. It is the presence of gravity, which comes with\na metric in scale-factor space of Lorentzian signature, which forces us to\nconsider infinite dimensional groups if we want to recover all the walls found\nin our previous analysis, and this is the main reason we need the theory of\nKM algebras. For finite dimensional Lie algebras we obtain only a subset of\nthe walls: one of the cushions of the associated billiard is missing, and one\nalways ends up with a monotonic Kasner-type behavior in the limit t \u2192 0+ .\nThe absence of chaotic oscillations for models based on finite dimensional Lie\ngroups is consistent with the classical integrability of these models. While\nthey remain formally integrable for infinite dimensional KM groups, one can\nunderstand the chaotic behavior as resulting from the projection of a motion\nin an infinite dimensional space onto a finite dimensional subspace.\nFor concreteness, we shall only consider one specific example here: the\nrelation between the cosmological evolution of D = 11 supergravity and\na null geodesic on E10 /K(E10 ) [28]. See Refs. [57, 58] for the extension\nof this correspondence to the two supergravities in D = 10, and Ref. [31]\nfor a complementary check of the correspondence in the case of D = 11\nsupergravity. We refer to [29] for a more general discussion of the link between\nKM billiards and KM coset models (including a discussion of the AE3 case\nrelevant for pure Einstein gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions). Note also that the\nrelevance of non-linear \u03c3-models for uncovering the symmetries of M-theory\nhas also been discussed from a different, spacetime-covariant point of view\nin [71, 68, 69], but there it is E11 rather than E10 that has been proposed as\na fundamental symmetry.\nThe action defining the bosonic part of D = 11 supergravity reads\n\u221a\nZ\nh\u221a\n\u2212G\n11\nS =\nd x \u2212G R(G) \u2212\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 F \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n48\ni\n1\n\u03b11 ...\u03b111\n+\n\u03b5\n(6.1)\nF\u03b11 ...\u03b14 F\u03b15 ...\u03b18 A\u03b19 \u03b110 \u03b111\n(12)4\n36\n\n\fwhere the spacetime indices \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 10, where \u03b501...10 = +1, and\nwhere the four-form F is the exterior derivative of A: F = dA.

All the elements entering\nthe construction of L have natural generalizations to the case where G is\nthe group obtained by exponentiation of a hyperbolic KM algebra. We refer\n12\n\nIn this section we denote the proper time by T to keep the variable t for denoting the\nparameter of the one-dimensional \u03c3-model introduced below.\n\n37\n\n\freaders to [52] for basic definitions and results of the theory of KM algebras,\nand here only recall that a KM algebra g \u2261 g(A) is generally defined by\nmeans of a Cartan matrix A and a set of generators {ei , fi , hi } and relations\n(Chevalley-Serre presentation), where i, j = 1, . . . , r \u2261 rank g(A). The elements {hi } span the Cartan subalgebra (CSA) h, while the ei and fi generate\nan infinite tower of raising and lowering operators, respectively. The \"maximal compact\" subalgebra k is defined as the subalgebra of g(A) left invariant\nunder the Chevalley involution \u03c9(hi ) = \u2212hi , \u03c9(ei ) = \u2212fi , \u03c9(fi ) = \u2212ei .\nT\nIn other words, k is spanned by the \"antisymmetric\" elements E\u03b1,s \u2212 E\u03b1,s\n,\nT\nwhere E\u03b1,s \u2261 \u2212\u03c9(E\u03b1,s ) is the \"transpose\" of some multiple commutator E\u03b1,s\nof the ei 's associated with the root \u03b1 (i.e. [h, E\u03b1,s ] = \u03b1(h)E\u03b1,s for h \u2208 h).\nHere s = 1, . . . mult(\u03b1) labels the different elements of g(A) having the same\nroot \u03b1. The (integer-valued) Cartan matrix of E10 is encoded in its Dynkin\ndiagram. See top diagram in Fig. 2.\nThe \u03c3-model is formulated in terms of a one-parameter dependent group\nelement V = V(t) \u2208 E10 and its Lie algebra valued derivative\nv(t) :=\nThe action is\n\nR\n\ndV \u22121\nV (t) \u2208 e10 \u2261 Lie E10 .\ndt\n\n(6.4)\n\ndtL with\nL := n(t)\u22121 hvsym (t)|vsym (t)i\n\n(6.5)\n\nwith a \"lapse\" function n(t) (not to be confused with N), whose variation\ngives rise to the Hamiltonian constraint ensuring that the trajectory is a\nnull geodesic. The \"symmetric\" projection vsym := 12 (v + v T ) eliminates the\ncomponent of v corresponding to a displacement \"along k\", thereby defining\nan evolution on the coset space E10 /K(E10 ). h.|.i is the standard invariant\nbilinear form on the KM algebra [52].\nBecause no closed form construction exists for the raising operators E\u03b1,s ,\n\u03b1 0\nnor their invariant scalar products hE\u03b1,s |E\u03b2,t i = Ns,t\n\u03b4\u03b1+\u03b2 , a recursive approach based on the decomposition of E10 into irreducible representations of\nits SL(10, R) subgroup was devised in [28]. [See also [57] for a decomposition\nof E10 based on its D9 subgroup, and [58] for a decomposition of E10 based on\nits A8 \u00d7 A1 subgroup.] Let \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b19 be the nine simple roots of A9 \u2261 sl(10)\ncorresponding to the horizontal line in the E10 Dynkin diagram, and \u03b10 the\n\"exceptional\" root connected to \u03b13 . [This root is labelled 10 in Fig.2.] Its\ndual CSA element h0 enlarges A9 to the Lie algebra of GL(10). Any positive\n38\n\n\froot of E10 can be written as\n\u03b1 = l\u03b10 +\n\n9\nX\n\nmj \u03b1j\n\nj=1\n\n(l, mj \u2265 0).\n\n(6.6)\n\nWe call l \u2261 l(\u03b1) the \"level\" of the root \u03b1. This definition differs from the\nusual one, where the (affine) level is identified with m9 and thus counts the\nnumber of appearances of the over-extended root \u03b19 in \u03b1 [38, 53]. Hence, our\ndecomposition corresponds to a slicing (or \"grading\") of the forward lightcone in the root lattice by spacelike hyperplanes, with only finitely many\nroots in each slice, as opposed to the lightlike slicing for the E9 representations (involving not only infinitely many roots but also infinitely many affine\nrepresentations for m9 \u2265 2 [38, 53]).\nThe adjoint action of the A9 subalgebra leaves the level l(\u03b1) invariant.\nThe set of generators corresponding to a given level l can therefore be decomposed into a (finite) number of irreducible representations of A9 . The\nmultiplicity of \u03b1 as a root of E10 is thus equal to the sum of its multiplicities\nas a weight occurring in the SL(10, R) representations. Each irreducible representation of A9 can be characterized by its highest weight \u039b, or equivalently\nby its Dynkin labels (p1 , . . . , p9 ) where pk (\u039b) := (\u03b1k , \u039b) \u2265 0 is the number\nof columns with k boxes in the associated Young tableau. For instance, the\nDynkin labels (001000000) correspond to a Young tableau consisting of one\ncolumn with three boxes, i.e. the antisymmetric tensor with three indices.\nThe Dynkin labels are related to the 9-tuple of integers (m1 , . . . , m9 ) appearing in (6.6) (for the highest weight \u039b \u2261 \u2212\u03b1) by\nS i3 l \u2212\n\n9\nX\nj=1\n\nS ij pj = mi \u2265 0\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere S ij is the inverse Cartan matrix of A9 . This relation strongly constrains\nthe representations that can appear at level l, because the entries of S ij are\nall positive, and the 9-tuples (p1 , . . . , p9 ) and (m1 , . . . , m9 ) must both consist\nof non-negative integers. In addition to satisfying the Diophantine equations\n(6.7), the highest weights must be roots of E10 , which implies the inequality\n2\n\n2\n\n\u039b =\u03b1 =\n\n9\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\npi S ij pj \u2212\n39\n\n1 2\nl\n10\n\n\u2264 2.\n\n(6.8)\n\n\fAll representations occurring at level l + 1 are contained in the product of\nthe level-l representations with the l = 1 representation. Imposing the Diophantine inequalities (6.7), (6.8) allows one to discard many representations\nappearing in this product. The problem of finding a completely explicit and\nmanageable representation of E10 in terms of an infinite tower of A9 representations is thereby reduced to the problem of determining the outer multiplicities of the surviving A9 representations, namely the number of times each\nrepresentation appears at a given level l. The Dynkin labels (all appearing\nwith outer multiplicity one) for the first six levels of E10 are\nl=1\nl=2\nl=3\nl=4\nl=5\nl=6\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n(001000000)\n(000001000)\n(100000010)\n(001000001) ,\n(000001001) ,\n(100000011) ,\n(100000100) ,\n\n(200000000)\n(100100000)\n(010001000) ,\n(000000010) .\n\n(6.9)\n\nThe level l \u2264 4 representations can be easily determined by comparison\nwith the decomposition of E8 under its A7 subalgebra and use of the Jacobi\nidentity, which eliminates the representations (000000001) at level three and\n(010000000) at level four. By use of a computer and the E10 root multiplicities listed in [53, 4], the calculation can be carried much further [39].\nFrom (6.9) we can now directly read off the GL(10) tensors making up\nthe low level elements of E10 . At level zero, we have the GL(10) generators K a b obeying [K a b , K c d ] = K a d \u03b4bc \u2212 K c b \u03b4da . The e10 elements at levels l = 1, 2, 3 are the GL(10) tensors E a1 a2 a3 , E a1 ...a6 and E a0 |a1 ...a8 with\nthe symmetries implied by the Dynkin labels. The \u03c3-model associates to\nthese generators a corresponding tower of \"fields\" (depending only on the\n\"time\" t): a zehnbein ha b (t) at level zero, a three form Aabc (t) at level\none, a six-form Aa1 ...a6 (t) at level two, a Young-tensor Aa0 |a1 ...a8 (t) at level 3,\netc. Writing the generic E10 group element in Borel (triangular) gauge as\nV(t) = exp Xh (t) * exp XA (t) with Xh (t) = ha b K b a and XA (t) = 3!1 Aabc E abc +\n1\nA\nE a1 ...a6 + 9!1 Aa0 |a1 ...a8 E a0 |a1 ...a8 + . . ., and using the E10 commutation\n6! a1 ...a6\nrelations in GL(10) form together with the bilinear form for E10 , we find up\nto third order in level\nnL =\n\n1 ac bd\n(g g\n4\n\n\u2212 g ab g cd )\u0121ab \u0121cd +\n40\n\n1 1\nDAa1 a2 a3 DAa1 a2 a3\n2 3!\n\n\f+ 12 6!1 DAa1 ...a6 DAa1 ...a6 +\n\n1 1\nDAa0 |a1 ...a8 DAa0 |a1 ...a8\n2 9!\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhere g ab = ea c eb c with ea b \u2261 (exp h)a b , and all \"contravariant indices\" have\nbeen raised by g ab .

Modulo field\nredefinitions, all numerical coefficients in (6.10) and (6.11) are uniquely fixed\nby the structure of E10 . See also [31] for a different perspective on the\nequations of motion of the E10 /K(E10 ) \u03c3-model.\nThe Lagrangian (6.5) is invariant under a nonlinear realization of E10\nsuch that V(t) \u2192 kg (t)V(t)g with g \u2208 E10 ; the compensating \"rotation\"\nkg (t) being, in general, required to restore the \"triangular gauge\". When\ng belongs to the nilpotent subgroup generated by the E abc , etc., this symmetry reduces to the rather obvious \"shift\" symmetries of (6.10) and no\ncompensating rotation is needed. The latter are, however, required for the\ntransformations generated by Fabc = (E abc )T , etc. The associated infinite\nnumber of conserved (Noether) charges are formally given by J = M\u22121 \u2202M,\nwhere M \u2261 V T V. This can be formally solved in closed form as\nM(t) = M(0) * exp(tJ).\n\n(6.12)\n\nThe compatibility between (6.12) (indicative of the integrability of (6.10))\nand the chaotic behavior of gab (t) near a spacelike singularity is discussed in\n[29].\nThe main result of concern here is the following: there exists a map\nbetween geometrical quantities constructed at a given spatial point x from\nthe supergravity fields G\u03bc\u03bd (x0 , x) and A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (x0 , x) and the one-parameterdependent quantities gab (t), Aabc (t), . . . entering the coset Lagrangian (6.10),\nunder which the supergravity equations of motion (6.3) become equivalent,\nup to 30th order in height, to the Euler-Lagrange\nequations\nof (6.10). In the\n\u221a\nR\n0\ngauge (6.2) this map is defined by t = x \u2261 dT / G and\ngab (t) = Gab (t, x)\n\n(6.13)\n\n41\n\n\fDAa1 a2 a3 (t) = F0a1 a2 a3 (t, x)\nDAa1 ...a6 (t) = \u2212 4!1 \u03b5a1 ...a6 b1 b2 b3 b4 Fb1 b2 b3 b4 (t, x)\n\nDAb|a1 ...a8 (t) =\n\n3 a1 ...a8 b1 b2\n\u03b5\n(C b b1 b2 (x)\n2\n\n+ 29 \u03b4[bb 1 C c b2 ]c (x)).\n\nP j\nThe expansion in height ht(\u03b1) \u2261 l +\nm , which controls the iterative\nvalidity of this equivalence, is as follows: the Hamiltonian constraint of\nthe coset model (6.10) contains an infinite series of exponential coefficients\nexp ( \u2212 2\u03b1(\u03b2)), where \u03b1 runs over all positive roots of E10 , and where\n\u03b2 a \u2261 \u2212ha a parametrize the CSA of E10 . The billiard picture discussed above\nis equivalent to saying that, near a spacelike singularity (t \u2192 \u221e), the dynamics of the supergravity fields and of truncated versions of the E10 coset\nfields is asymptotically dominated by the (hyperbolic) Toda model defined\nby keeping only the exponentials involving the simple roots of E10 . Higher\nroots introduce smaller and smaller corrections as t increases. The \"height\nexpansion\" of the equations of motion is then technically defined as a formal BKL-like expansion that corresponds to such an expansion in decreasing\nexponentials of the Hamiltonian constraint. On the supergravity side, this\nexpansion amounts to an expansion in gradients of the fields in appropriate\nframes. Level one corresponds to the simplest one-dimensional reduction of\n(6.3), obtained by assuming that both G\u03bc\u03bd and A\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd depend only on time\n[25]; levels 2 and 3 correspond to configurations of G\u03bc\u03bd and A\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd with a\nmore general, but still very restricted x-dependence, so that e.g. the frame\nderivatives of the electromagnetic field in (6.3) drop out [33]. In [28, 31] it is\nchecked that, when neglecting terms corresponding to ht(\u03b1) \u2265 30, the map\n(6.13) provides a perfect match between the supergravity evolution equations\n(6.3) and the E10 coset ones, as well as between the associated Hamiltonian\nconstraints. (In fact, the matching extends to all real roots of level \u2264 3.) Let\nus also mention in passing (from [31]) that the E10 coset action is not compatible with the addition of an eleven-dimensional cosmological constant in the\nsupergravity action (an addition which has been proven to be incompatible\nwith supersymmetry in [5]).\nIt is natural to view the map (6.13) as embedded in a hierarchical sequence\nof maps involving more and more spatial gradients of the basic supergravity\nfields. The height expansion would then be a way of revealing step by step\na hidden hyperbolic symmetry, implying the existence of a huge non-local\nsymmetry of Einstein's theory and its generalizations. Although the validity\nof this conjecture remains to be established, one can at least show that there\nis \"enough room\" in E10 for all the spatial gradients. Namely, the search\n42\n\n\ffor affine roots (with m9 = 0) in (6.7) and (6.8) reveals three infinite sets\nof admissible A9 Dynkin labels (00100000n), (00000100n) and (10000001n)\nwith highest weights obeying \u039b2 = 2, at levels l = 3n + 1, 3n + 2 and 3n + 3,\nrespectively. These correspond to three infinite towers of \u03b5 elements\nEa1 ...an b1 b2 b3 , Ea1 ...an b1 ...b6 , Ea1 ...an b0 |b1 ...b8\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhich are symmetric in the lower indices and all appear with outer multiplicity one (together with three transposed towers). Restricting the indices\nto ai = 1 and bi \u2208 {2, ..., 10} and using the decomposition 248 \u2192 80+84+84\nof E8 under its SL(9) subgroup one easily recovers the affine subalgebra\nE9 \u2282 E10 . The appearance of higher order dual potentials (\u00e0 la Geroch) in\nthe E9 -based linear system for D = 2 supergravity [14] indeed suggests that\nwe associate the E10 Lie algebra elements (6.14) to the higher order spatial gradients \u2202 a1 * * * \u2202 an Ab1 b2 b3 , \u2202 a1 * * * \u2202 an Ab1 ...b6 and \u2202 a1 * * * \u2202 an Ab0 |b1 ...b8 or to\nsome of their non-local equivalents. Finally, we refer to [29] for a more general discussion of the height expansion of Kac-Moody \u03c3-models, and we note\nthat the approach of [28, 29] can be extended to other physically relevant\nKM algebras, such as BE10 [26, 21] and AEn [27].\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
