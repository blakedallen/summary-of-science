To mimic the exact interstellar condition, gas grain interactions via accretion from the gas phase and desorption (thermal\nevaporation and photo-evaporation) from the grain surface are considered. We find\nthat the chemical composition of the interstellar grain mantle is highly dependent on\nthe physical parameters associated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are\nseen to play an important role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar\ngrain mantle. We consider the effects of interstellar photons (photo-dissociation and\nphoto-evaporation) in our simulation under various interstellar conditions. We notice\nthat the effects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of lower visual extinction. These photons contribute significantly in the formation of the grain mantle.\nEnergy of the incoming photon is attenuated by the absorption and scattering by the\ninterstellar dust. Top most layers are mainly assumed to be affected by the incoming\nradiation. We have studied the effects of photo-dissociation by varying the number of\nlayers which could be affected by it.

Different routes to the\nformation of water molecules are studied and it is noticed that around the dense region, production of water molecules via O3 and H2 O2 contributes significantly. At the\nend, various observational evidences for the condensed phase species are summarized\nwith their physical conditions and are compared with our simulation results.\nKey words: Astrochemistry, ISM: abundances, molecules, evolution, Stars: formation, methods: numerical\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe densities in the interstellar space (consisting of 99% gas and 1% dust), even in the densest interstellar clouds, are so low that\nthey are beyond the capabilities of the best vacuum systems on Earth. Even then, a large number of infrared absorption features\nare observed toward low and high mass protostars. Some of these features are attributed to the solid state interstellar molecules\n(Boogert & Ehrenfreund 2004). Discovery of these interstellar molecules in condensed phase demands a proper explanation for\nthe interstellar chemical composition budget. Increasing observational and experimental evidences in the gas phase points to the\ninadequacy of the gas phase chemistry and suggests the need to incorporate the grain surface processes. Interstellar dust grains\nare thought to be consisting of an amorphous silicate or carbonaceous core surrounded by a molecular ice layer (Draine et al.,\n2003; Gibb et al., 2004). Presently, very little is known about the morphology or chemistry on these grain surfaces, or the porosity of the grains themselves. Similarly, the chemical and physical processes on the grain surfaces till date are also very poorly\nknown. A number of theoretical attempts have been carried out to verify the observed abundances of the gas phase and the condensed phase species (Hollenbach & Salpeter 1970; Watson & Salpeter 1972; Allen & Robinson 1975; Tielens & Hagen 1982;\nHasegawa et al. 1992; Charnley 2001; Stantcheva et al. 2002; Cuppen & Herbst 2007; Chakrabarti et al. 2006a,b; Das et al.\n2008a,b; Das et al., 2010). Both the deterministic and stochastic approaches are tested by these studies. Observational and\nexperimental evidences suggest that almost 90% of the grain mantle is covered with H2 O, CH3 OH and CO2 . In our earlier\n\n\f2\n\nAnkan Das, Sandip K. Chakrabarti\n\npaper Das et al., (2010), (hereafter DAC10), we mentioned that it is very difficult to theoretically match the exact observed\nabundances of all the three molecules simultaneously. Results of the numerical simulations show that only in a narrow region\nof parameter space all these three molecules are produced within the observed limit.\nIt is well known that the ISM chemistry is highly influenced by the interstellar UV radiations which mainly come from\nthe nearby young stars. UV radiation affects the chemistry of the ISM through photo-dissociation and photo-ionization of\nthe molecules and atoms. Several works are carried out to study the photo-chemistry in the ice containing simple as well as\ncomplex molecules. Most of the studies (Hagen et al. 1979; D'Hendecourt al. 1982; Allamandola et al. 1988) are concentrated\nfollowing the irradiation of ice mixtures to reflect the chemical composition of the star forming regions. These types of studies\ngive us an insight about the photo effects on the interstellar ice mantles.\nStructure of the interstellar ices under various physical circumstances are yet to fully understood. Water ice is less\nabundant along some lines of sight. In the present paper, we carry out a coupled gas-grain study to fully understand the\nstructure of the interstellar grain mantle around various lines of sight. Gas-grain interactions are considered via accretion\nfrom gas phase and evaporation from grain surface. Important surface reactions, which are feasible under the interstellar\nconditions are considered in our surface chemistry network to have clear insight of the interstellar ice feature. Moreover, to\nmimic the realistic situation, the formation of several mono-layers are considered. As we are interested only around the dense\nregion of the molecular cloud, we assume that the major portion of the gas phase carbon atoms are already converted into\ncarbon monoxide and as in the other models (Stantcheva et al. 2002; Das et al. 2008b; Das et al., 2010), we also consider the\naccretion of H, O and CO from the gas phase to follow the time evolution of several chemical species. Recent experimental\nfindings of several new reaction pathways and several interaction energies involved during these process, motivate us to\nupdate our earlier DAC10 model. Our main aim in the present context is to study the formation of ice mantle under the\ninfluence of photo-processing and to make a comparative study among different routes to the water formation. This has been\nsuggested recently by some experiments (Ioppolo et al., 2008). We also compare our simulation results with other observational,\nexperimental and theoretical results carried out till date. In Section 2, we discuss the physical processes and the method used\nfor the modeling. Extensive discussions along with the results are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, a comparison between\nthe theoretical and observational results are presented. Finally, in Section 5 we have summarized our work.\n\n2\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nIn general, the rate equation method (Hasegawa et al. 1992; Roberts & Herbst 2002) is widely used to follow the surface\nprocess occurring under the interstellar condition. Main advantage of this method is that the computation is very fast. This\nmethod assumes the average concentration of species to follow the chemical evolution. Main drawback with this method is\nthat it does not consider the statistical fluctuations and discrete nature of the species. As a result, this method is very much\ndependent on the physical conditions of the interstellar cloud. In the lower accretion rate regime, where surface population is\ncomparatively lower, this method tends to overestimate the result (Chakrabarti et al. 2006a,b; Das et al. 2008b; Das et al.,\n2010). Moreover as this method deals with the average concentration, it is not able to follow the internal structure of the\ngrain mantle. However, as the time passes by, grains are expected to grow in size with several surface species. As the rate\nequation is unable to trace any particular species, it is not possible for this method to mimic the actual situation in ISM. This\nis the reason, we use the descrete-time random walk Monte Carlo method to have more accurate results. In our approach,\nfluctuations in the surface abundance due to the statistical nature of the grain is preserved and as a result this method is\nmuch more realistic to study the interstellar surface chemistry. With this method, we can follow movements of each species\nand evaluate the results at every instant.\nDetails of the processes we follow are already discussed in Das et al., (2010). For the sake of completeness, we discuss\nthem again briefly. We assume that the grains are square shaped and similar to an atom on an fcc[100] plane, each grain site\nhas four nearest neighbors. We assume the periodic boundary conditions and also allow the possibility to form multiple layers\non a grain surface. For modeling purposes, we consider classical dust grains, characterized by 1000A\u25e6 and 106 surface sites.\nFollowing Hasegawa et al. (1992), we consider the surface density of available sites to be 1.5 \u00d71015 cm\u22122 . Number density of\nthe grains are taken to be 1.33\u00d710\u221212 n (n is the concentration of H nuclei in all forms) and gas to dust ratio is taken to be\n100 by mass(Hasegawa et al. 1992). Monte Carlo method is computationally much slower than the rate equation method and\nit is quite difficult to simulate for a grain having 106 sites. To save computational time, we consider the grain having 50 \u00d7 50\nsites and the final results are extrapolated for the grain having 106 sites. Reason behind choosing the grain having 50 \u00d7 50 sites\nis that it is above the limit of the statistical fluctuating size and according to Chang et al. (2005), above this size, results are\nscalable and do not differ significantly. Location of the accreting species is dictated by generating a pair of random numbers.\nLangmuir Hinshelwood (reactions between the surface species via hopping) and Eley Rideal (reaction between the incoming\nspecies with the surface species), both types of reactions are considered. After landing on a grain, its direction towards any one\nof the four nearest neighbors is dictated by generating random numbers. Two possibilities may occur: If the site is occupied\nthen either it will react when the reaction is permitted or it will wait until its next hopping time. If the neighboring site is\n\n\fComposition and evolution of Grain mantle\n\n3\n\nvacant and it does not have any species just beneath that site then it can roll down on that grid until it touch some existing\nspecies in a layer or just the bare grain surface. If the reaction between the species touching the existing species is permitted, a\nnew species is formed and if not, then it can sit on the top of that. For the reactions having barriers, we are generating random\nnumbers upon each encounter and checking for the possibility of the reaction. Following Hasegawa et al. (1992) probability\n(P) for the reaction to happen upon an encounter is calculated and if the generated random number is less than P then the\nreaction is allowed and if the generated number is greater than P then reaction is discarded at that instant. Every species\nhas its own hopping time scale. In our simulation, we consider the hopping time scale of H atom to be the minimum. After\neach interval of H hopping time, we are checking for the evaporation (via thermal or other process) and photo-dissociation\nby generating random numbers. For example, let us consider H2 O. Its evaporation rate is Rev sec\u22121 . That means, one H2 O\ncan evaporate after each R1ev seconds of its formation on the grain. Since the smallest time scale is the hopping time scale\ntH of an H atom, after every tH , we generate a random number to find out whether the species will evaporate or stick to the\ngrain. If the generated number is smaller than tH \u00d7 Rev , then the species can evaporate. Photo-dissociations are also treated\nsimilarly, i.e., if the generated random number is under the probability of photo-dissociation of any species, that species can\nphoto-dissociate. Gas phase compositions are adjusted at every tH after taking care of the accretion onto and the evaporation\nfrom the grains.\nA major difference between our previous study and the present study is that we have updated our reaction network by\nconsidering several new reactions and have considered the effects of the cosmic rays as well. Cosmic rays have the direct/induced\neffect on the interstellar grain mantle. In our model, we consider the photo-dissociation and photo evaporation to incorporate\nthe effects of the cosmic rays. Formation of the most abundant molecules such as, H2 O, CH3 OH and CO2 are considered as\nbefore. Keeping in mind the recent experimental results (Ioppolo et al., 2008), we have also included the formation of H2 O\nvia O3 and H2 O2 routes. All the reactions considered in our present model are given in Table 1. Activation barrier energy\nused in our previous paper (Das et al., 2010), and in some other papers (Stantcheva et al. 2002; Cuppen & Herbst 2007) are\nnoted in Tab.1. We gave some comments on the most recent experimental/theoretical findings in the last column. For the\nreaction numbers 4 and 6, we normally use 2000K as the activation barrier energy (Stantcheva et al. 2002). However, the most\nrecent findings by Fuchs et al., (2009), suggest that the energy barrier could be much lower (390 \u00b1 40K for reaction number\n4 and 415 \u00b1 40K for the reaction number 6 at 12K). In our model calculation, we assume that at 10K, the energy barrier is\n390K for the reaction number 4, and 415K for the reaction number 6. So far, barrier energy 1200K was used as mentioned in\nMelius & Blint (1979). Recent experimental findings by Ioppolo et al., (2008) suggest that the reaction number 12 is barrier\nless. Recent surface chemical modelling by Cazaux et al., (2010) assumed that the reaction number 14 is also barrier less\nthough it is not experimentally verified. In our model, we assume reaction number 12 is barrier less and reaction number\n14 with barrier 1400K (Klemm et al., 1975). Reaction number 16 is considered to have the activation energy 2600K (Schiff\n1973). Binding energies of the species are the keys for the chemical enrichment of the interstellar grain mantles. Grain surface\nprovides the space for the interstellar gas phase species to land on and to react with the other surface species. If allowed,\nchemical species can return back to the gas phase after chemical reactions or in the original accreted form. Reactions between\nthe surface species is highly dependent on the mobility of the surface species, which in turn, depends on the thermal hopping\ntime scale or on the tunneling time scale. For the lighter species, tunneling time scale is much shorter than the hopping time\nscale. So for the lighter species, surface migration by tunneling method might be effective. When two surface species meet,\nthey can react. If some activation energy involved for that reaction to happen, they can react with a quantum mechanical\ntunneling probability (P). Goumans & Andersson (2010) studied the tunnelling reaction between O and CO with direct\ndynamics employing density functional theory and they obtained the activation energy 2500K for the reaction between O and\nCO. We use only thermal hopping of O atom for its mobility on the grain surface and use the same activation barrier energy,\n2500K following Goumans & Andersson (2010) for the reaction number 9 of Tab. 1. In Das et al. (2008b), a comparative\nstudy between tunneling and hopping for the mobility of H atom on the grain surface was carried out and it was noticed that\nresults did not show drastic variation within the accretion regime considered here (number density 103 -106 ). We expect that\nas long as the accretion rate is within the limit , this does not significantly affect the final results.\nThere are two types of binding energies associated with the physical processes at low temperature, namely, physisorption\nand chemisorption. Among them, physisorption energies are more probable in low temperature (\u223c 10K) condition, i.e., frigid\n(low temperature, \u223c 10K) condition. Therefore, in our model calculations, we considered the physisorption energies. We\ndefined the whole system with a lot of interaction energies. Most of the energies considered here are discussed in detail in\nDas et al., (2010) and references therein. The rest of the species which are updated in our present model are given in Table\n2. It is very difficult to find the exact binding energies for every specific surface. In Das et al., (2010), olivine surface was\nconsidered for the modeling purpose. Presently, we also considered olivine surface as a model substrate. Among the updated\nchemical species, binding energies of HO2 , O3 and H2 O2 are taken from Cazaux et al., (2010). They used the physisorbed\nenergies of these molecules for the Carbonaceous grain and here we have included their values as if those are the interaction\nenergies with the bare olivin surfaces. For C atom, we used the same binding energy as in CO. For CH3 and CH2 OH, we\nused the same binding energies as in CH3 OH and H2 CO respectively. Since the binding energies of these species are very\nhigh, we can be sure that our assumptions would not alter the final results significantly.

Due to the lack of knowledge about the different photo-dissociation rates of the\nsurface species, we assumed that the photo-dissociation rates of the surface species are the same as in the gas phase species.\nList of photo reactions along with the various parameters necessary for the direct cosmic ray photo reactions and cosmic ray\ninduced photo reactions are noted in Table 3.

Here we use\n\u03c9 = 0.6 in our all calculations. For the other Cosmic ray induced photo reactions which are marked by 'a ' in Table 3, we\ncalculate the rate by the following equation;\nRi = \u03b1\u03b3.\n\n(2)\n\nFor the direct interstellar photo reactions, the rate is derived as;\nRd = \u03b1exp(\u2212\u03b3Av ) s\u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, Av is the extinction at visible wavelengths caused by the interstellar dust.\nNormally, first few layers are assumed to be affected by the interstellar photons. Keeping this in mind, we use Monte-Carlo\napproach to investigate this aspect. Probabilities of photo reactions and photo evaporations are applied by the use of random\nnumber generators. After the photo dissociation, the heavier counterpart is allowed to replace the dissociated species and the\ncomparatively lighter counterpart is stored in the nearby vacant sites or react with other nearby suitable species of the same\nlayer. If there are no site available on the same layer to satisfy the criterion, dissociated lighter species may drop down to the\nlower vacant site or act with some other suitable reactant. After this, if it fails to find out a suitable location then the lighter\nspecies is allowed to evaporate. We notice that during our simulation time scale, the evaporation probability of the lighter\ncounterpart is close to zero, so this assumption should not result in any error. Photo-evaporation are also incorporated in our\ncode by the help of the random number generator as discussed earlier.\nMobility of a species inside the ice leads to chemical enrichment of the interstellar grain mantle. Photo-dissociation adds\nup a new dimension to the ice mantle by changing its morphology. Its contribution towards the final structure of the interstellar\ngrain mantle should not be neglected around some regions of the ISM.\n3.1.1\n\nDependence on the Extinction parameter\n\nIn Fig. 1, percentage of photo-dissociated molecules are plotted with the extinction parameter. Both the Rate equation and\nMonte Carlo methods are considered for a thorough study of these effects. Along the 'Y' axis we have shown the percentage\nof molecules which are photo-dissociated for a given species. For the better agreement of our simulated results with the\nobservations, we choose the initial conditions around the favorable zone mentioned in DAC10 (Das et al., 2010). DAC10\nparameters consist of hydrogen number density (\u223c 104 cm\u22123 ), atomic Hydrogen number density (\u223c 1.10 cm\u22123 ), atomic\nOxygen number density (\u223c 1.05 cm\u22123 ), Carbon-monoxide number density (0.375 cm\u22123 ), and temperature (10K). Unless\notherwise stated, throughout the paper we use the DAC10 parameters as the initial condition and all the results are shown\nafter evolving the system up to two million years. For the regions having other number densities, we scale the number density\nof O and CO accordingly by keeping the atomic hydrogen number density of 1.10 cm\u22123 . It is evident from Fig. 1 that the lower\nextinction regions are heavily affected by the interstellar photons. For this simulation, we assume that only first mono-layer\nof the evolving grain mantle is exposed to the interstellar gas and photo-reaction/evaporation can only occur from the first\nmono-layer. It is clear from the figure that in the Monte Carlo method, the water (1%-98%), methanol (6%-95%) and CO2\n(91%-99%) production is heavily influenced due to interstellar photons and the effects are prominent. Photo-dissociations of\nCO (0.07%-97%) and OH (0.009% \u2212 42%) are significant in the Monte Carlo method at the lower extinction region. Around\nAV = 3, the percentage of photo-dissociation of CO and OH are 2.3% and 0.19% respectively which turns into 97% and 42%\n\n\f6\n\nAnkan Das, Sandip K.

Effect of photo-dissociation on the number of layers exposed to the gas phase. Note that beyond fifty mono-layers, there is a\nsaturation in photo-dissociation.\n\nrespectively when Av = 0.5. This demonstrates how strongly the grain surface species are affected by the interstellar UV\nradiation field around the low extinction region.\nIn the Rate equation method, the trend is more or less similar. However, it is to be noted that the stable species are\nphoto-dissociated in the Rate equation method more strongly as compared to the Monte Carlo method. OH and CO are\ncomparatively less affected. The reason behind the enhanced photo-dissociation effect for the stable species in case of the Rate\nequation method is that this method is not capable of tracing the species layer wise or location wise. Hence the molecules\nare dissociated with a constant fraction always. However, for the Monte Carlo method, since we are considering the photo\neffect responsible for the first layer only, its contribution is lower than the Rate equation method. In the case of Rate equation\nmethod, trace amount of OH or CO is left over due to the formation of water but in case of Monte Carlo method, some OH\nmay be sustained due to not having the suitable reactant partner or due to the 'blocking effect' For instance, if a reactive\nspecies is surrounded by various surface species with which reactions are not allowed or require high activation barrier energies,\n\n\fComposition and evolution of Grain mantle\n\n7\n\n-2\n\nColumn density (cm )\n\n1e+21\n\n1e+18\n\n(H2O)photo\n(CH3OH)photo\n(CO2)photo\n(CO)photo\n\n1e+15\n\n(O2)photo\nH2 O\nCH3OH\nCO2\nCO\nO2\n\n1e+17\n\n1e+18\n\n1e+19\n\n1e+20\n\nDepth (cm)\n\nFigure 3.

A comparison\nbetween the consideration of with and without the photo effects is shown.\n\nthe species remains locked in until its desorption. If it overcomes the energy barrier during its lifetime on the grain or by any\nother mechanism such as evaporation or hopping of the surrounding species to free its location, then only the reactive species\nis unblocked. This is the 'blocking effect' and it is a very common feature around the dense cloud, where the surface species are\nvery much abundant. Due to this reason, in the Monte Carlo method there are some OH or CO which are photo-dissociated\nas they remain in the grain for some time. On the contrary, in the case of Rate equation method this is not possible due to\nthe production of molecules at a constant rate.\n\n3.1.2\n\nEffects of the choice of the exposed layers\n\nInterstellar radiation field is attenuated by the dust particles and thus the effects are also reduced with depth. The incoming\nparticles have the energies in the range of 20 \u2212 70MeV nucleon\u22121 which can deposit energy up to 0.4 MeV (Leger et al.,\n1985) on an average into the classical size dust particles having radius \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm. Several models are present to explain the\ninteraction of interstellar energetic particles with the dust. Depending on the energy of the interacting particle, it can penetrate\ndeep inside the grain mantle. Recent chemical model by Andersson et al., (2006) considered photo-dissociation of the top six\nlayers only. Nguyen et al., (2002) assumed a limit of one hundred mono-layers that could be reached by photo-dissociation.\nWestley et al., (1995) assumed that most of the desorption takes place only from the outermost mono-layers. In Fig. 2, we\nhave explained how the final results are altered by the assumption of the number of exposed layers to the gas phase. In all\nthe cases Photo-desorption is asumed to be effective only from the top most layer and photo-dissociation is assumed to be\neffective upon the choice of the exposed layers. Along X-axis, we plot the choice of the number of upper layers which can\nbe affected by the inter-stellar photon. Along Y-axis, we plot the percentage of photo-dissociated species at the end of the\nsimulation time (2 \u00d7 106 year). Percentage is calculated by just calculating the ratio of total number of photo-dissociated H2 O,\nCO2 or CH3 OH molecules with the total number of H2 O, CO2 or CH3 OH produced during the simulation and multiplying\nthe ratio by 100. The life time of a molecular cloud is in general few million years. We restricted our simulation time up\nto 2 \u00d7 106 year. In Fig. 2, results are presented for the intermediate density (104 cm\u22123 ) cloud after 2 \u00d7106 year, a steady\nstate of the grain surface species is reached due to the depletion of the gas phase species by that time. As the gas phase\ncomposition changes, production of stable molecules are becoming less significant on the grain but the photodissociation rate\nis not changing. As a results, percentage of photo-dissociated molecules are dependent on the simulation time. But, since we\nare presenting the results at the end of the life time of the molecular cloud, in that sense results showing the final percentage\nof the photo-dissociated molecules.\nAs expected, the percentage of photo-dissociated molecules increases as the number of exposed layers increases. Mantle\nthickness grows up to \u223c 80 \u2212 85 layers for the physical conditions considered here. This calculation is carried out assuming the\nDAC10 parameters as the initial condition. Results are plotted after evolving the system up to two million years. After sixty\nlayers the effects are slowed down. For the higher density region, where mantle grows up to several mono-layers these effects\n\n\f8\n\nAnkan Das, Sandip K. Chakrabarti\n\nshould be more enhanced. But one point should be remembered that in this case, the field strength itself will be attenuated,\nas it go deep inside the mantle and the effects might be visible for the top-most mono-layers only.\nIn our work, we have tested how the choices of number of exposed layers may affect the final results. Because the mantle\ncolumn density is very low, we assumed that all the exposed layers, considered in the respective simulations, may 'feel' the\neffects of interstellar photons in a similar manner. In principle, it should have been decreased as it is going deep inside the\nmantle, but this may be negligible. In the rest of the paper, we consider two extreme cases: When the photo-dissociation is\neffective only for (a) the outermost layer and (b) uppermost fifty layers.\n3.1.3\n\nColumn density\n\nWhen we study molecular abundances, we do not see any local molecular density, but we observe only the column densities\nof the molecules. So theoretical calculation of the column density of a given molecule should be done in order to compare the\ntheoretical and observational results. The column density of a species is given by (Shalabiea et al., (1994)),\nN (A) = \u03a3ni (A, Ri )\u2206Ri ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, ni (A,Ri ) is the local number density of species A at location Ri and \u2206Ri = Ri \u2212 Ri\u22121 is the grid spacing along the\ni)\n, where nH i is the number\nradial(R) direction. Number density of the species at the location Ri is given by, xi = ni (A,R\nnH\ni\n\ndensity of the cloud at the ith location. Following Shalabiea et al., (1994), length of the line of sight Rtot can be represented\nas;\nRtot =\n\n1.6 \u00d7 1021 \u00d7 Av\ncm,\nnH i\n\n(5)\n\nwhere, AV is the visual extinction of cloud. Taking summation over the entire grid (total k number of grids),\n\u03a3k1 xi = \u03a3k1\n\nni (A, Ri )\n.\nnH i\n\n(6)\n\nSo the column density of a species 'A' is given by,\nN (A) = \u03a3ki nH i xi \u2206Ri .\n\n(7)\n\nFor the constant density cloud, nH i = nH . We get,\nN (A) = nH \u03a3ki xi \u2206Ri .\n\n(8)\n\nFor k = 1;\nN (A) = nH xi \u2206Ri .\n\n(9)\n\nThus, by knowing the extinction parameter, we can calculate the depth of a cloud from Eqn. 5 and the corresponding Column\ndensity from Eqn. 9. In Fig. 3, we show the depth dependence of the column density of the major interstellar grain surface\nspecies with and without interstellar photo effects. We assumed the initial conditions as in DAC10. From Fig. 3, it is clear\nthat the column density increases with the depth of the cloud (measured from the outer edge), which indicates that as we are\ngoing deeper inside the cloud, production enhances. Pictures should be better interpreted if we assume that the extinction\nparameter consists of two components: the first one is 6 5 (corresponding depth 8 \u00d7 1017 cm, from Eqn. 9) and the next\none is > 5. For this figure, we have converted the final abundances into the column density after 2 \u00d7 106 years. Low value\nof the extinction parameter means diffuse or weakly translucent cloud, so it is likely to evolve the cloud with much longer\ntime (around 107 years, here we evolve the cloud only up to 2 \u00d7 106 year). In this lower region, we find out a very stiff slope\nof the column density with the extinction parameter/depth of the cloud, whereas at the moderate translucent cloud region\n(Av > 5) we have almost a linear relationship. For the lower end of the extinction parameter or equivalently when length of\nthe line of sight is smaller, we still have a significant water formation during the life time (2 \u00d7 106 year) of the molecular cloud.\nAccording to Murakawa et al., (2000), the observed column density of the condensed water molecules along the lower edge\nof the extinction parameter \u223c 0.5 is around 1017 cm \u22122 . Murakawa et al., (2000) studied the Heiles Cloud 2, which is a part\nof the Taurus molecular cloud complex. Average number density of the dense core is around 104 cm\u22123 (Onishi et al., 1996).\nFrom Fig. 3, our calculated column density of condensed phase water is around 1.1 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 . For the lower extinction\nregion, cloud may have larger life time, which means that we need to calculate the column density after much longer time\nthan the previous cases. For the sake of completeness, we tested a case for Av = 0.5 (corresponds to the depth of 8 \u00d7 1016\ncm) for 107 years and obtain the column density of water ice around 4.6\u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 . This is much better than the previous\nestimate. Photo effect can be better understood if we make a comparison of two cases. In one case we include this effect, and\nin the other case we exclude this effect. In Fig. 3, gray lines are drawn for the cases where we have not considered the photo\neffects. Difference between the two results are distinctly visible towards the low extinction region. For the better realization\nof these differences, we have tabulated the column densities of the different species at Table 4 for AV = 0.5 (corresponding\n\n\fComposition and evolution of Grain mantle\n\n9\n\nTable 4.

It is clear from the Table 4 that\nin the region of very low extinction, composition of the grain mantle is completely different due to the interstellar photo\neffect. Column densities of water & methanol are strongly affected by the interstellar photo reactions. Column densities of\nall the species are decreased except O2 . Interestingly, it is increasing around these region. The reason behind this increased\ncolumn density of O2 is that it can be easily photo-dissociated by forming two Oxygen atoms, which in turn react to form O2\nmolecules again. Source of atomic oxygen may also come from the photo-dissociation of OH, CO2 , HO2 , O3 and CO. Due to\nthe large number of O atoms on the grain surfaces, O2 abundances increased (Fig. 3).\n3.1.4\n\nRelation between Av and hydrogen number density\n\nFollowing Lee et al., (1996), the relationship between hydrogen density and visual extinction is given by,\nnH = nH 0 [1 + [(\n\nnH max 1/2\nAv\n)\n\u2212 1)\n]]2 ,\nnH 0\nAv max\n\n(10)\n\nwhere, nH = n(H) + 2n(H2 ) is the total hydrogen density in the unit of cm\u22123 , nH 0 is the cloud density at the cloud surface,\nnH max is the maximum density and AV max is the maximum visual extinction considered very deep inside the cloud. Lee et al.,\n(1996) considered the above relations for T = 30K and here for the limitation of our present model we assume that this relation\nis valid for 10K also. We assume that at the lowest depth (i.e., at the cloud surface) hydrogen density nH 0 is 103 cm\u22123 and\nit reaches its maximum nH max = 105 cm\u22123 at deep inside the cloud (corresponding AV max = 150). Composition of the\ngas phase around different regions are taken accordingly by just appropriate scaling of the DAC10 parameters. In Fig. 4,\nvariation of column density with respect to the extinction parameters are shown. Column density of the species at different\ninterstellar extinction is taken from results obtained at 2 million years. The inset shows the variation of the number density\nfor the varying extinction parameters. As in Fig. 3, here also H2 O is the major constituent of the grain mantle. Methanol\nis the 2nd abundant contributor initially but deep inside the cloud its contribution slightly decreases. The reason behind is\nthat due to the increasing number density around the region of high extinction parameters, accretion rates of O and CO\nincrease and as a result, the surface coverage of O related species increases (CO2 and O2 increases). The accretion rate of\natomic hydrogen is not increasing as we assumed that it is constant (1.10 cm\u22123 ) around the all region, though in principle,\nit should have decreased slightly around the high density region. Due to the lack of atomic hydrogen on the grain surfaces,\nall the hydrogenated species are looking to be produced less efficiently around the high density/high extinction region. As a\nresult, the surface coverage of CO increases rapidly around these regions.\n3.1.5\n\nTime dependent Case\n\nArmed with various parameters, we will now simulate more realistic case, where the density is not constant with time.\nTo start with, we assume that a cloud is collapsing from a low density region (nH 0 = 103 cm\u22123 ) to the higher density\n(nH max =105 cm\u22123 ) region. Density is assumed to be increasing linearly with time and reaches its maximum at around 2\nmillion years. We assume that around the high density region, the cloud has the maximum value of the extinction parameter\n(Avmax = 150) and the cloud is assumed to be collapsing isothermally (T = 10K). Using Eqn. 10, we can calculate the\ncorresponding extinction parameter. So in that way we now have a pseudo dynamic nature of the interstellar collapsing\ncloud where we have a relation between the time and the other parameters. The gas phase composition changes according\nto the density of the surrounding molecular cloud. The initial compositions are taken by appropriate scaling of the DAC10\nparameters and effects of interstellar photons are considered only for the uppermost layer. Interaction of the gas and the\ngrain are considered by assuming the accretion and evaporation process. Fig. 5 shows the time variations of column densities.\nColumn density of species at a particular instant is calculated by just converting the abundance by Eqn. 9. It is evident\nfrom the figure that at the beginning, since the density is pretty low and the extinction is much lower, the longevity of the\nseveral species are restricted due to the strong radiation field. Inset pictures show the variation of the (a) hydrogen number\ndensity and the (b) extinction parameter with the time. At the beginning, due to the strong UV radiation field (low extinction\nparameter), the column density of several species fluctuates. After 105 years, variations are more or less smoother due to the\n\n\f10\n\nAnkan Das, Sandip K.

As like the other cases, here also water is the most\nabundant species. Surface coverage of methanol is noticed to be reduced heavily in compare to the other results.\n3.2\n\nDifferent routes to water formation\n\nRecent experiment by Ioppolo et al., (2008) shows that there are alternative routes for the formation of water on the interstellar\ngrain other than the traditional one (H+OH \u2192 H2 O). We have visited the problem of the water production via different routes\nby using our modified Monte Carlo code. Fig. 6 shows that the water molecules are mainly formed by the well known traditional\nroute but as the density of the molecular cloud changes (for simplicity, we keep other physical constraints as constant: Av = 10\nand T = 10K), other pathways for the formation of water molecules also appears to be significant. For example, at lower\ndensity regions (n \u223c 103 cm\u22123 ), almost 100% of the water molecules are formed by the traditional route but when the number\ndensity of hydrogen is around 106 cm\u22123 , this goes down to 39%. At higher number density regions, production of O2 is\n\n\fComposition and evolution of Grain mantle\n\n11\n\n100\n\nH + H2O2 ---> H2O + OH\nH + O3 ---> O2 + OH\n\n10\n\n1e+02\n\n1\n\nO2\n\nSurface coverage (%)\n\nPercentage of water formation (%)\n\nH + OH ---> H2O\n\n0.1\n\n1e+01\n\nH2O2\nHO2\nO3\n\n1e+00\n\n1e-01\n\n1e-02\n1e+03\n\n1e+04\n\n1e+05\n\n1e+06\n-3\n\nNumber density (cm )\n\n0.01\n1000\n\n10000\n\n1e+05\n\n1e+06\n\n-3\n\nNumber density(cm )\n\nFigure 6. Different routes to H2 O.\n\nfavorable and due to the high surface coverage of solid O2 , O3 can be produced very efficiently. Since the activation barrier\nenergy for the reaction between H and O3 is very low (450K), O3 can readily react with H to form an OH, which in turn, form\nH2 O by another hydrogenation reaction. Formation of H2 O by the O3 route is very efficient at high density regions (maximum\n\u223c 48%) compare to the low density region (around \u223c 0.02%). There is another route to H2 O, namely from H2 O2 . Reaction\nNos. 12 to 14 are associated with the formation of H2 O via this route. Formation is maximum around the high density region\n(13%). At around n \u223c 106 cm\u22123 , production of O3 is highly favorable due to high surface coverage of atomic oxygen as well\nas O2 molecules. O3 molecules are produced efficiently via Langmuir Hinshelwood or via Eley Rideal method, as a result, the\nsurface coverage of O2 decreases. The inset clearly displays the above aspects showing the variation of the surface coverage of\nseveral condensed phase species with the number density of the molecular cloud. It is clear that the surface coverage of O2\nhaving a peak at around 105 cm\u22123 region and beyond this region as the density increases, rate of production of O3 enhances.\nAs a result, the surface coverage of O2 decreases.\nAround the dense region of the molecular cloud, H2 is the most abundant species in the gas phase and H2 O can be very\nefficiently produced in the gas phase via reaction number 16 of Tab. 1. But the problem with H2 is that it can not able to stick\nwell with the grain surface (Leitch & Williams 1985). So we use sticking coefficient of H2 to be zero. As like the stantcheva\n2002, Das et al., 2008b, and Das et al., 2010, here also we consider only the accretion of H, O and CO from the gas phase. In\nour model, we allow gas phase H2 to react with surface OH via Eley-Rideal mechanism. But, as H2 + OH reaction requires\nvery high activation energy (2600K) Schiff (1973) and surface abundance of OH is very low, production of water via this\nroute is negligible. H2 may produce on the grain surface via reaction between two H atom and can contribute to the water\nformation route. But if we look at the accretion time scale of H atom onto a 50\u00d750 grain kept at T\u223c10K, it comes out to be\naround 4.8 \u00d7 107 sec for 104 cm\u22123 number density cloud. The evaporation time scale at 10K is around 535 sec. So there is\nno chance for one H to meet with other H via accretion. Despite of this fact H2 may produce on the grain surface when two\nH atom meet together. For that instant one H is the accreted H atom and the second one is the product due to the reaction\nbetween O and HCO (reaction number 10 of Tab.1). Since the production of H2 by this way also not significant enough, this\nreaction does not significantly contributes to the water formation on the grain.\n\n3.3\n\nComparison with Observations and other Models\n\nNGC 7538 IRS 9, W33A, W3 IRS 5, S140 IRS 1, RAFGL 7009S were chosen to compare our results with observations. The\nreasons behind choosing these sources are that these sources are believed to be protostellar objects which are deeply embedded\ninside dense molecular clouds. Beside this, they have a very high level of extinction from dust in the dense molecular cloud\nand they exhibit infrared spectra with the molecular ice feature. In Table 5, observed column densities as well as relative\nabundances of abundant observed ice species (H2 O, CH3 OH, CO2 , CO and O2 ) along different lines of sight are compared\nwith our various modeling results. Column densities are expressed in the unit of 1017 cm\u22122 . Normally relative abundances\nof ice species are used to express the observed ice features and this is calculated by just calculating the surface abundance\nof any species with respect to the surface abundance of water and then multiplying the factor by 100. Observed relative\nabundances along various sources as well as the relative abundances obtained from our simulation results are noted inside the\nbracket. Appropriate references for the observed data are noted at the bottom of the table. For the comparison purpose, four\nmodels are considered; DAC10a, DAC10b, DAC10a(m) and DAC10b(m). In DAC10a and DAC10b model, initial conditions\nare taken around the favourable zone of the parameter space (Das et al., 2010), having number density of the cloud 104\n\n\f12\n\nAnkan Das, Sandip K. Chakrabarti\n\ncm\u22123 and temperature 10K. Difference between DAC10a and DAC10b model is that, for DAC10a model, effect of photo\nreactions/evaporations are considered only for the outermost layer and for DAC10b model, Photo-dissociation is considered\nfor the uppermost 50 layers but photo-evaporation is restricted only from the topmost layer. In DAC10a and DAC10b\nmodel, extinction parameter is assumed to be independent upon the initial number density of the cloud. In DAC10a(m) and\nDAC10b(m) model, density variation of the extinction parameters are taken into account (Eqn. 10). In the inset picture of Fig.\n4, variation of number density with respect to the extinction parameter of the cloud is shown. These models may be better\nunderstood by just referring the section 3.1.4. Difference between DAC10a(m) and DAC10b(m) model is the same as the\ndifference between the DAC10a and DAC10b model mentioned just above. Column densities from our simulation results are\ntabulated after two million years. Column density is calculated by using Eqn. 9, where column density is directly proportional\nto the extinction parameter (AV ). While we are considering the effect of photo-reactions for the uppermost 50 layers (DAC10b\nand DAC10b(m) model), production of the stable species(H2 O, CO2 , CH3 OH and O2 ) decreases for most of the cases compare\nto the cases, where only topmost layer is considered for the effective photo reactions/evaporations (DAC10a and DAC10a(m)\nmodel). Opposite trend is noticed for the CO molecule. Since in case of DAC10b and DAC10b(m) model, a large number\nof CO2 molecules can be affected by photodissociations (CO2 \u2192 CO +O) compare to the DAC10a and DAC10a(m) model\nrespectively, surface coverage of CO molecule increases.\nIn Fig. 3, DAC10a model was used, where number density of the cloud is assumed to be independent upon the extinction\nparameter. It is clear from Fig. 3 that beyond AV =10, this effect is negligible. We have carried out similar simulations for the\nDAC10b model also and noticed the similar trend. In Table 5, all the observed sources having extinction parameter beyond 10.\nDue to this reason, in Table 5, relative concentration of the ice species along different lines of sight are constant for DAC10a\nand DAC10b model. Column density for all the models varies, since it is proportional to the extinction parameter by Eqn.\n9. In case of the DAC10a(m) and DAC10b(m) model, initial number density is totally different compare to DAC10a and\nDAC10b model (Eqn. 10) and as a results, in Table 5, relative concentration along different lines of sight also differs.\nThere are several chemical models for explaining the chemical evolution of the interstellar grain mantle by Monte\nCarlo method. Our Monte Carlo model is distinctly different from the other Monte Carlo models used by several authors\n(Cazaux et al., 2010; Cuppen & Herbst 2007; Cuppen et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2005). Our initial gas phase composition is\nalso different in compare to the other models. We use initial composition of gas phase according to the favourable zone\nmentioned in Das et al., (2010). Chang et al. (2005) studied the formation of molecular hydrogen only on the grain surfaces\nby Monte Carlo procedure so it is not possible to compare our results directly with them. Main difference between ours and\nCazaux et al., (2010), is that they did Monte Carlo simulation to follow the chemistry involving H, D, and O. They did not\nconsider the chemistry involving CO. In our case, we consider the chemistry between H, O and CO on the interstellar grain\nand Deuterium chemistry yet to be considered in our model. Cuppen & Herbst (2007), studied the formation of water on\ngrain surface for diffuse, translucent and dense clouds. They did not consider the formation of CH3 OH and CO2 on the grain.\nAs a results, grain mantle was always dominated by the water. In Cuppen et al. (2009) formation of CH3 OH was considered\nand it is noticed that in our case H2 CO is under produced, in comparison with the Cuppen et al. (2009).\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation to study the formation and structural information of the interstellar\ngrain mantle. The main results of our study are as follows:\n\u2022 The effects of interstellar radiations are included to extract the information about the structure of the interstellar grain\nmantle. The effects of photo-dissociation are studied as a function of the extinction parameter. For lower values of the\nextinction parameter, the photo-dissociation effects dominate. A comparison between the Rate equation method and the\nMonte Carlo method has been made and difference in results between the two approaches is presented in Fig.1. We notice\nthat in comparison with the Monte Carlo method, the Rate equation method always overestimates the abundances of species.\nStable species like H2 O, CH3 OH and CO2 are photo-dissociating more strongly in the Rate equation method as compared to\nthe Monte Carlo method.\n\u2022 Recent chemical models assumed that the interstellar photons can have effects on the first few mono-layers only. But as the\ncolumn density of the grain mantle itself is very low, we assume that the effect may be significant also deep inside the mantle.\nWe notice that the choices of number of exposed layers can affect the chemical composition of the interstellar grain mantle\nsignificantly.\n\u2022 Column densities are calculated along different lines of sight and it is noticed that deep inside the cloud, the probability of\nfinding different grain surface species are very high. Effects of interstellar photons are extensively studied and it is noticed\nthat beyond AV =10, its contribution toward the chemical evolution is negligible.\n\u2022 Column densities of various grain surface species are studied for static as well as time dependent models.

In the time dependent model, variation of the number density and extinction parameter\nwith time is considered to follow the chemical evolution during the collapsing phase of a proto-star. It is noticed that since\ninitially the density was low, formation of several species was seriously hindered by the effects of the interstellar photon. As\nthe time passes by, the density and AV increases, which in turn enhance the production of several grain surface species.\n\u2022 Water is the most abundant species on the grain. There are several routes by which water can be formed on the interstellar\ngrain. Major parts of H2 O are formed via traditional route(H + OH). But there are also other pathways responsible for the\nH2 O production on the grain. From our simulation, we find that the formation of H2 O via O3 and H2 O2 routes are also have\nsignificant contributions, especially in high density regions.\n\u2022 A comparison between the results of our approaches and observational data has been made along different lines of sight.\nThe initial gas phase composition was chosen from the DAC10 model (DAC10a and DAC10b) as well as the modified DAC10\nmodel (i.e., by considering the variations of density with the extinction parameter, DAC10a(m) and DAC10b(m)). Some of\nour results are found to be in good agreement with different observational results obtained so far.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partly supported by a DST project (Grant No. SR/S2/HEP-40/2008).\n\nREFERENCES\nAllamandola, L.
