The production of W \u00b1 bosons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at RHIC\nprovides a new means of studying the spin-flavour asymmetries of the proton sea quark spin\ndistributions. Details of the W\u00b1 event selection through the e\u00b1 decay channel at mid-rapidity\nare presented, along with preliminary results for the production cross section and parity\u221a\nviolating single-spin asymmetry, AL , from the STAR Collaboration's 2009 data set at s = 500\nGeV. Lastly, the expected sensitivities for future running are discussed.\n\n1. Introduction\n\u221a\nHigh-energy polarized p+p collisions at s = 500 GeV at RHIC provide a unique way to\nstudy the partonic spin structure of the proton. Inclusive polarized deep-inelastic scattering\n(DIS) experiments have shown that only \u223c30% of the spin of the proton is attributable to\nthe polarization of the quarks [1]. However, these inclusive measurements do not discern\nbetween the various flavours of the quarks and their individual contributions. Semi-inclusive DIS\nmeasurements, however, can achieve separation of the quark and anti-quark spin contributions\nby flavour [2]. The extracted anti-quark polarized Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) have\nsizable uncertainties compared to the well-constrained quark and anti-quark sums [3].\nW \u2212(+) bosons are produced in p+p collisions, at leading order, through \u016b + d(d \u0304 + u)\ninteractions at the partonic level and can be detected through their leptonic decays. The parityviolating nature of the weak interaction gives rise to large single beam helicity asymmetries, AL ,\nwhich yield a direct and independent probe of the quark and anti-quark polarized PDFs. The\nsingle helicity asymmetry is defined as AL = (\u03c3 + \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 ) / (\u03c3 + + \u03c3 \u2212 ), where \u03c3 +(\u2212) refers to the\ncross section when the helicity of the polarized proton beam is positive (negative). Theoretical\nframeworks have been developed to describe the production of W\u00b1 bosons and their decay\nleptons in polarized p+p collisions [4, 5].\n2. Recent Measurements\nThe measurements described in these proceedings were done using the STAR detector [6] at\nRHIC. The used detector systems are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), which provides\ntracking of charged particles in a 0.5 T solenoidal magnetic field for pseudorapidities of |\u03b7| \u2264 1.3\nand the Barrel and Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeters (BEMC,EEMC), which are leadscintillator sampling calorimeters covering |\u03b7| \u2264 1 and 1.09 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 2, respectively. All three\ndetectors provide 2\u03c0 coverage in azimuthal angle, \u03c6. The data presented in this contribution,\nwhich correspond to 13.7 \u00b1 0.3 (stat) \u00b1 3.1(syst) pb\u22121 of sampled luminosity, were accumulated\nin 2009 when a first significant dataset was collected for polarized proton collisions at a centre\n\n\f-\n\n-\n\np+p \u2192 W \u2192 e + \u03bd e\nelectron |\u03b7| < 1\nW candidates\nBackg. est.\n\n80\n\nBackg. subtr.

During this period, the beam polarizations averaged (38 \u00b1\n3)% and (40 \u00b1 5)% for the two beams.\nIn this analysis, only the W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bd decay channel was considered. The electrons and\npositrons at mid-rapidity from these W\u00b1 decays can be detected by a large transverse energy,\nET , peaked near MW /2. In order to preferentially select the events containing a high energy\ne\u00b1 , a two-stage online BEMC trigger was required. First an event was required to satisfy a\nhardware threshold corresponding to a transverse energy, ET > 7.3 GeV, in a single BEMC\ntower. Additionally, a software level trigger then searched for a seed tower with ET > 5 GeV\nand required that the maximum 2\u00d72 tower cluster including that seed have an ET sum larger\nthan 13 GeV.\nW\u00b1 candidate events were selected offline based on kinematical and topological differences\nbetween leptonic W \u00b1 decay events and QCD background (e.g. di-jets) events. W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bd\ndecay events contain a nearly isolated e\u00b1 and an undetected neutrino opposite in azimuth,\nleading to a large missing ET . The selection proceeded in three stages : e\u00b1 candidate\nidentification, isolation, and background rejection. An e\u00b1 candidate is identified as any TPC\ntrack with pT > 10 GeV/c which originated from the event vertex with |z| < 100 cm, where\nz is the direction along the beamline from the nominal interaction point. Furthermore, it was\nrequired that this track points to a 2\u00d72 BEMC tower cluster with an ET sum, ET2\u00d72 , greater\nthan 15 GeV and whose centroid was less than 7 cm from the extrapolated track. Next, two\nisolation cuts are imposed on the candidate. First, successful candidates were required to have\nan excess ET in the surrounding 4\u00d74 tower cluster be less than 5% of ET2\u00d72 . Secondly, the\ncandidates were required to have anpexcess EMC tower + TPC track ET sum of less than 12%\nof ET2\u00d72 within a cone radius R = (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2 = 0.7 of the candidate. Two background\nrejection cuts were applied. First, the magnitude of the vector pT sum of the e\u00b1 candidate pT\nvector and the pT vectors of all the reconstructed jets with thrust axes outside the R = 0.7 cone\naround the candidate was required to be greater than 15 GeV/c. The jets were reconstructed\nusing the standard mid-point cone algorithm used in previous STAR jet measurements [7, 8].\nSecond, the away-side ET , which was defined to be the EMC + TPC ET sum over the full range\nin pseudorapidity and having \u2206\u03c6 > 3\u03c0/4 from the e\u00b1 candidate track, was required to be less\nthan 30 GeV.\n\n\f\u03c3 (pb)\n\nRun 9 STAR Preliminary p+p\n\ns = 500 GeV\ne\n\nKinematic acceptance: |\u03b7e| < 1 and E T > 25 GeV\n\n\u03c3(W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bde)\n\n90\n\nAL\n0.4\n\n80\n\nSTAR Preliminary Run9\n\ns=500 GeV\n\np+p \u2192 W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bd\ne\n\nET >25 GeV\n\nW-\n\n70\n\nW\n\n60\n\n0.2\n\n+\n\n\u03c3 - \u03c3AL= \u03c3 + + \u03c3\n+\n\n0\n\n50\n\nWSTAR Data\n\n40\n\nLumi.

The amount of background remaining in the W\u00b1\ncandidate sample, after applying the selection criteria described above, was estimated from\nthree contributions. The first contribution was from W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 + \u03bd decay where the \u03c4 \u00b1 decays\nsemi-leptonically to an e\u00b1 and two neutrinos. This background was estimated using Monte Carlo\nsimulation. Another contribution estimated the impact of the missing calorimetric coverage for\n\u22122 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u22121.09. To determine this contribution to the background, the analysis was performed\na second time with the EEMC not used as an active detector. The difference in the W\u00b1\ncandidate ET2\u00d72 distribution with and without the EEMC included in the analysis was taken\nto be the estimate for the missing calorimetric coverage. The third contribution was estimated\nby normalizing a data-driven background shape to the remaining W\u00b1 candidate signal, in the\nET2\u00d72 range below 19 GeV, after the first two background contributions were removed. This\ndata-driven background shape was obtained by inverting the last two requirements in the W\u00b1\ncandidate selection, namely by requiring that the away-side ET be greater than 30 GeV or\nthe magnitude of the vector pT sum be less than 15 GeV/c. The total background was then\nsubtracted from the W\u00b1 candidate spectrum to yield the W\u00b1 signal spectrum (see figure 1). A\nsystematic uncertainty for the background estimation was determined by varying the inverted\ncuts used to obtain the data-driven background shape and by varying the range where the\nbackground shape was normalized to the remaining W\u00b1 candidate signal.\nPreliminary results for the production cross sections and single helicity asymmetries of\n\u00b1\nW \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bd from events with |\u03b7| \u2264 1 and ET2\u00d72 > 25 GeV can be seen in figures 2 and\n3.

Future Measurements\n\u221a\nIn the future, STAR plans to take more data at s = 500 GeV. This data will place a clean\nconstraint on the quark and anti-quark polarized PDFs of the proton. The expected sensitivities\nfor the single helicity asymmetry as a function of pseudorapidity can be seen in figure 4.\nThe calculation in the figure assumed our demonstrated efficiency and background rejection\nin the mid-rapidity region while in the forward and backward rapidity regions, a worse signal to\nbackground ratio was assumed. The uncertainties are for 300 pb\u22121\n\u221a of sampled luminosity and\n70% average polarization which is the the goal of the longitudinal s = 500 GeV spin program\nat RHIC.\n4. Summary\nThe\u221aSTAR Collaboration has taken its first data with longitudinally polarized proton beams\nat s = 500 GeV in 2009. First results on the mid-rapidity cross section and single helicity\nasymmetry for W \u00b1 were presented. This opens a new era in the study of the spin-flavour\nstructure of the proton based on the production of W \u00b1 bosons.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nFilippone B W and Ji X D 2001 Adv.
