On the 2-D image, shown\nin Fig. 1, these ions constitute the innermost pair of half\nrings (I + -I). If, instead, both iodine atoms are ionized\nthe velocity of the I + ions is increased due to their internal Coulomb repulsion. On the 2-D image these ions\nconstitute the outermost pair of half rings (I + -I + ). Using Coulomb's law the I + velocity distribution from this\nchannel gives directly the internuclear distribution [9].\nProbe\npulse\nMolecular\nbeam\n\nPump\npulse\n\nI2\n\n\u03c4\n\nI+\n\nI+ - I\n\nQuantum state tomography derives its name from the\ntomographic technique in medical diagnostics by which\nthree-dimensional images of the inner parts of an object\nor a person can be derived from two-dimensional NMR or\nX-ray pictures obtained from different directions, a technique for which Cormack and Hounsfield were awarded\nthe Nobel prize in physiology and medicine in 1979. In\nquantum physics, we often deal with a phase space, characterizing the position and velocity distribution of particles, and the aim of quantum state tomography is to\ndetermine this distribution from only position and momentum measurements on the particles. As an example,\nthe oscillatory motion of a particle in a quadratic potential is described as a simple rotation in phase space,\nand hence the mathematical Radon-transform technique\n[1], used in physiology and medicine can be used to extract the phase space distribution of such a particle if\nonly position measurements are made sufficiently often\nover a time corresponding to the oscillation period. This\ntechnique has been succesfully applied to analyze bound\nmolecular states, where the internuclear distance oscillates harmonically [2], and it has been used for nonclassical states of light [3, 4], which are formally described as harmonically trapped particles. A number of\nextensions have been made to incorporate anharmonicities in the trapping potential, and to use mathematical\nreconstruction techniques which match specific detection\nschemes [5, 6, 7, 8]. In the present work we determine the\ninternuclear quantum state of dissociating I2 molecules.\nThe atomic fragments are created in a state with positive energy, and they fly apart with no confining force\nbetween them. The situation thus differs from the one\nof trapped motion, and it calls for a new theoretical approach.\nExperimentally, I2 molecules in a molecular beam are\nphotodissociated by irradiation with a 100-fs-long pump\npulse centered at 488 nm (see Fig. 1). To determine\nthe internuclear separation (position) and velocitiy (momentum) of the dissociating molecules at time \u03c4 after\nexcitation the atomic I fragments are ionized by a 20fs-long probe pulse, and the velocities of the I + ions are\nmeasured by a 2-dimensional ion detector [9].

Both laser beams are polarized vertically. The\nI + ions produced are pushed by a weak electrostatic field (not\nshown) towards a 2-D ion detector, where their positions are\nused to determine the internuclear velocity distribution (I + -I\nchannel) and the internuclear separation distribution (I + -I +\nchannel). The image shown on the detector is recorded for a\ndelay of 5 ps between the pump and the probe pulse.\n\nThe atomic density is sampled on a discrete position\ngrid with N grid points, where N = 51 in the example\nshown in Fig. 2. For the data presented here, the reconstruction is based on position distributions recorded at \u03c4\n\n\f2\n= 2, 3, 4, 5 picoseconds (ps) and the momentum distribution (which is identical at the four different delays). In\nquantum tomography on harmonic oscillator states the\nfast and slow velocity components are slushing back and\nforth, and the time dependent position distribution maps\nthe phase space distribution from all angles. In free expansion, slow particles will not be able to catch up on\nfast ones, and we have access to only sheared pictures\nof the distribution where the high velocity components\nare shifted towards larger displacements than the low velocity components. This implies that a range of angular\nviewing angles is missing, and we cannot apply the Radon\ntransform to reconstruct the phase space distribution.\nFurthermore, the data-sets are noisy due to the finite\ncounts in different position intervals, and our task is to\nestablish the most reliable estimate of \u03c1 in best possible (rather than perfect) agreement with the observed\ndata. Following Drobny and Buzek [10], we apply Jaynes'\nmaximum entropy principle which at the same time provides the smallest deviation from the measured data\nand the largest possible von Neumann entropy [10, 11]:\nS(\u03c1) = \u2212T r(\u03c1 ln \u03c1). Drobny and Buzek have used the\nmaximum entropy principle for quantum state tomography on harmonically trapped atoms detected at too few\ninstants of time to allow a normal reconstruction [12],\nand we have reformulated their method to deal with free\natoms.\nTo calculate the von Neumann entropy, one may use\nthe familiar expression in terms\nP of the eigenvalues pj of\nthe density matrix, S = \u2212 j pj ln pj , but as it was\nshown by Jaynes [11], it is not necessary to compute\nthe entropy of \u03c1 in order to use the maximum entropy\nprinciple: The density matrix with largest entropy which\nconforms best with measured values ai for a set of observables Ai , can be written on the form\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n1\n\u03bbi Ai ),\nexp(\u2212\nZ\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bbi are variables that have to be adjusted to satisfy\nthe agreement with the measured data, and Z normalizes\nthe density matrix to unit trace.\nA position distribution is the set of expectation values of projection operators on position eigenstates |xihx|.\nWe determine the position distribution at different times,\nand we need a formal representation of the projection\noperator |x, tihx, t| where |x, ti is a position eigenstate\nat time t. For free particles the momentum p = h\u0304k is\na conserved quantity, and it is convenient to represent\nthe projection operators in a momentum representation,\nsince momentum eigenstates accumulate only a trivial\nphase factor with time, |k, ti = exp(ih\u0304k 2 t/2M )|k, t = 0i:\nZ\n|xihx| = dk1 dk2 |k1 ihk1 |xihx|k2 ihk2 |\nZ\n1\n=\ndk1 dk2 exp(i(k2 \u2212 k1 )x)|k1 ihk2 |.\n(2)\n2\u03c0\n\nBoth the spatial distribution at various times and the momentum distribution, which is independent of time, are\nmeasured, and the observables Ai in Eq.(1) are precisely\nthe operators |x, tihx, t| and |kihk|, which are now given\nexplicity as N by N matrices in a discrete basis. The\nexponential in Eq.(1) is understood as a matrix power\nseries, and it has to be evaluated numerically because the\nmomentum projection operators and the position projection operators at different times do not commute.\nIn our numerical reconstruction we used four position\ndistributions and one momentum distributions, and we\nthus identified 5 * 51 variables \u03bbi so that the expectation\nvalues hAi i =Tr(\u03c1Ai ) are as close as possible to the measured distributions. We quantify the agreement with the\nmeasured data\nP ai by the sum of the squares of all deviations \u2206 = i (ai \u2212 hAi i)2 . A numerical routine identifies\nthe global minimum of \u2206 as a function of the \u03bbi variables, and we thus obtain the explicit expression for the\ndensity matrix in Eq.(1).\nTo illustrate our reconstruction of the internuclear\nquantum state of the dissociated molecules we use the\nWigner function W (x, p) [13] rather than the N by N\ncomplex density matrix, discussed above. The Wigner\nfunction is obtained by a Fourier transform with respect\nto the difference between the two momentum arguments\nin the density matrix. While still fully characterizing\nthe quantum state the Wigner function is a real function, and it has the advantage of presenting at one glance\nthe joint position and momentum distribution. Figure 2\nshows the Wigner function, W (x, p), at the earliest (2\nps) and the latest time (5 ps) for which position distributions were recorded. Note that we present the momentum dependence in units of the velocity v = p/M of the\natomic fragments to facilitate comparison of the two panels. The two Wigner functions in Fig. 2 a) and b) have\nthe same velocity distributions, but they are sheared differently in phase space due to the free motion of the two\niodine photofragments. On the side panels the marginal\nposition and velocity distribution, obtained by integrating W (x, p) over velocity and position, respectively, are\ncompared with the experimental results (open circles).\nThe agreement is excellent, and similar good agreement is\nfound between the measured data and the reconstructed\nstate at the intermediate times at 3 and 4 ps.\nWe stress that the Wigner function contains more information than what can be obtained directly from a\nsingle measured position and velocity distribution. For\ninstance, both the measured position and velocity distribution at 2 ps consists of two peaks (side panels of Fig.\n2 (A)), but without further information it is not possible\nto determine if the molecules at the larger internuclear\nseparation (the peak around 13.6 \u00c5 ) are also the ones\nmoving with the largest internuclear velocity (the peak\naround 4.6 \u00c5/ps). The tomographic reconstruction of\nthe Wigner function makes use of our knowledge of the\nposition distributions measured at 3, 4 and 5 ps, and,\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Three dimensional surface plots showing the phase\nspace distribution function W (x, p) (Wigner function) at\ntwo different times after the pump pulse dissociates the I2\nmolecule (tau=2ps in part (A) and tau = 5 ps in part (B)).\nThe marginal position and momentum distributions of the\ndissociated molecules are shown on the side panels: The full\ncurves are the reconstructed distributions (integrals over the\nWigner function with respect to momentum and position, respectively), and the open circles are the measured distributions. To provide a more intuitive view the momentum variable is presented in velocity units.\n\ndissociation by the pump pulse [9].\nIt has been emphasized in the literature [13] that the\nWigner function is not a real probability distribution because, due to complimentarity and Heisenbergs's uncertainty relation, it is not meaningful to assign precise values for both the position and velocity of a particle. This\nhas as its most striking consequence that states exist for\nwhich W (x, p) attains negative values, but these negative values always occur in phase space regions with area\nless than Planck's constant h\u0304 = h/2\u03c0. Dissociation of\nmolecules by two phase-locked femtosecond laser pulses\nwill produce photofragments in a coherent superposition\nof two localized wave packets [9], and we are currently\nworking on improvement of the experiments to enable reconstruction of the Wigner function with a sufficient resolution to display the negativities expected in this case.\nSuch an experiment constitutes a fs time resolved analogue to double-slit atom interferometer studies [14].\nQuantum state tomography has been established in\nquantum optics as a remarkable diagnostics tool that has\nprovided clear illustrations of the experimental ability to\ncontrol and manipulate selected states of fundamental\nquantum systems such as a single field mode and single\nions and atoms [4, 6, 7, 8, 12]. Our experimentally reconstructed density matrix or Wigner function provides\nthe complete information about the non-trivial quantum\nstate of the internuclear motion of the dissociating I2\nmolecules. Although our experimental method is limited to small molecules, we believe that quantum state\ntomography will be applicable also to study chemical reactions in large molecules through time resolved position\ndata obtained, e.g., by the emerging femtosecond electron and X-ray diffraction techniques [18, 19, 20, 21].\nThis will open for comparisons with theoretical calculations at a much more detailed level than probability\ndistributions of single observables, which have formed\nthe basis of comparison so far in femtosecond time resolved chemical reaction dynamics. Finally, we note that\nmodern femtosecond laser technology enables controlled\nshaping of both the electronic and the atomic structure of\nmolecules through irradiation with sequences of tailored\nlaser pulses [15, 16, 17]. To fully exploit the capabilities\nof such quantum manipulation it is crucial to completely\ncharacterize the molecular quantum states formed.\nWe acknowledge the support from the Carlsberg Foundation and The Danish Natural Science Council.\n\nindeed, the two separated peaks in W (x, p) at 2 ps show\nthat the iodine atoms roughly 13.6 \u00c5 apart have a velocity distribution centered around 4.6 \u00c5/ps whereas the\niodine atoms apparoximately 12.4 \u00c5 apart have a velocity distribution centered at 4.0 \u00c5/ps.
