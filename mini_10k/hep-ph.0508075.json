These noncommutative models can arise naturally as lowenergy effective theories from string theory and D-branes. As field theories they must\nsatisfy a number of restrictive constraints detailed below, and this makes them particularly\ninteresting and challenging for purposes of particle physics model building. For general\nreviews of noncommutative gauge theories the reader can consult e.g. Refs. [1; 2; 3].\nThere are two distinct approaches used in the recent literature for constructing quantum field theories on noncommutative spaces. The first approach uses the Weyl-Moyal\nstar-products to introduce noncommutativity. In this case, noncommutative field theories\nare defined by replacing the ordinary products of all fields in the Lagrangians of their\ncommutative counterparts by the star-products\n\u2190\u2192\ni \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\n\n(\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c6)(x) \u2261 \u03c6(x) e 2 \u03b8\n\n\u03c6(x) .\n\n(1.2)\n\nNoncommutative theories in the Weyl-Moyal formalism can be viewed as field theories on\nordinary commutative spacetime. For example, the noncommutative pure gauge theory\naction is\nZ\n1\n(1.3)\nS = \u2212 2 d4 x Tr(F\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 F \u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n2g\n\nwhere the commutator in the field strength also contains the star-product. The important\nfeature of this approach is the fact that phase factors in the star-products are not expanded\nin powers of \u03b8 and the \u03b8 dependence in the Lagrangian is captured entirely. This ability\nto work to all orders in \u03b8 famously gives rise to the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing\n[4; 5] in the noncommutative quantum field theory which we will review below.\n\nThe second approach to noncommutativity does not employ star-products. It instead relies [6; 7] on the Seiberg-Witten map which represents noncommutative fields\nas a function of \u03b8 and ordinary commutative fields. This approach essentially reduces\nnoncommutativity to an introduction of an infinite set of higher-dimensional (irrelevant)\noperators, each suppressed by the corresponding power of \u03b8, into the action. There are\ntwo main differences compared to the Weyl-Moyal approach. First, in practice one always\nworks with the first few terms in the power series in \u03b8 and in this setting the UV/IR\nmixing cannot be captured. Second, the Seiberg-Witten map is a non-linear field transformation. Therefore, one expects a non-trivial Jacobian and possibly a quantum theory\ndifferent from the one obtained in the Weyl-Moyal approach. In the rest of this paper we\nwill concentrate on the Weyl-Moyal approach.\n\n1\n\n\fIn the context of Weyl-Moyal noncommutative Standard Model building, a number\nof features of noncommutative gauge theories have to be taken into account which are\nbelieved to be generic [8]:\n1. the mixing of ultraviolet and infrared effects [4; 5] and the asymptotic decoupling of\nU(1) degrees of freedom [9; 10] in the infrared;\n2. the gauge groups are restricted to U(N) groups [11; 12] or products of thereof;\n3. fields can transform only in (anti-)fundamental, bi-fundamental and adjoint representations [13; 14; 15];\n4. the charges of matter fields are restricted [16] to 0 and \u00b11, thus requiring extra care\nin order to give fractional electric charges to the quarks;\n5. gauge anomalies cannot be cancelled in a chiral noncommutative theory [13; 16; 17;\n18; 19; 20; 21], hence the anomaly-free gauge theory must be vector-like.\nBuilding upon an earlier proposal by Chaichian et al. [22], the authors of Ref. [8]\nconstructed an example of a noncommutative embedding of the Standard Model with the\npurpose to satisfy all the requirements listed above. The model of [8] is based on the\ngauge group U(4) \u00d7 U(3) \u00d7 U(2) with matter fields transforming in noncommutatively\nallowed representations. Higgs fields break the noncommutative gauge group down to a\nlow-energy commutative gauge theory which includes the Standard Model group SU(3) \u00d7\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)Y . The U(1)Y group here corresponds to ordinary QED, or more precisely to\nthe hypercharge Y Abelian gauge theory. The generator of U(1)Y was constructed from\na linear combination of traceless diagonal generators of the microscopic theory U(4) \u00d7\nU(3) \u00d7 U(2). Because of this, the UV/IR effects \u2013 which can affect only the overall traceU(1) subgroup of each U(N) \u2013 were not contributing to the hypercharge U(1)Y . However\nsome of the overall trace-U(1) degrees of freedom can survive the Higgs mechanism and\nthus contribute to the low-energy effective theory, in addition to the Standard Model\nfields. These additional trace-U(1) gauge fields logarithmically decouple from the lowenergy effective theory and were neglected in the analysis of Ref. [8]. The main goal of\nthe present paper is to take these effects into account.\nWe will find that the noncommutative model building constraints, and, specifically, the\nUV/IR mixing effects in the trace-U(1) factors in the item 1 above, lead to an unacceptable\ndefective behavior of the low-energy theory, when we try to construct a model having the\nphoton as the only massless colourless U(1) gauge boson. Our findings rule out a class of\nnoncommutative extensions of the Standard Model.\n(a) This class is based on a noncommutative quantum gauge theory defined on a fourdimensional continuous space-time (UV cutoff sent to infinity). Within the Weyl-Moyal\napproach there are two ways to avoid our conclusions. Either one can introduce extra\ndimensions [23] or one can give up the continuous space-time.\n2\n\n\f(b) Noncommutative models we concentrate on are similar to the example in [8] and\nshould be distinguished from earlier ones studied in [22] for two reasons.1 First, we include\nthe effects of the UV/IR mixing in our analysis. Second, is that our models preserve full\nnoncommutative gauge invariance including the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. As such, the\ndifficulties related to unitarity violation discussed in [25] do not apply in our case.\n(c) Finally, as already mentioned earlier, we are not pursuing the Seiberg-Witten\nmap approach and as such our conclusions cannot be directly applied to the class of\nnoncommutative models which rely on Taylor expansion in powers of \u03b8 in [6; 7; 26; 27;\n28; 29; 30; 31; 32].\nThe UV/IR mixing in noncommutative theories arises from the fact that certain classes\n\u03bc\u03bd\nof Feynman diagrams acquire factors of the form eik\u03bc \u03b8 p\u03bd (where k is an external momentum and p is a loop momentum) compared to their commutative counter-parts. These\nfactors directly follow from the use of the Weyl-Moyal star-product (1.2). At large values\n\u03bc\u03bd\nof the loop momentum p, the oscillations of eik\u03bc \u03b8 p\u03bd improve the convergence of the loop\nintegrals. However, as the external momentum vanishes, k \u2192 0, the divergence reappears\nand what would have been a UV divergence is now reinterpreted as an IR divergence\ninstead. This phenomenon of UV/IR mixing is specific to noncommutative theories and\ndoes not occur in the commutative settings where the physics of high energy degrees of\nfreedom does not affect the physics at low energies.\nThere are two important points concerning the UV/IR mixing [5; 9; 10; 12] which we\nwant to stress here. First, the UV/IR mixing occurs only in the trace-U(1) components\nof the noncommutative U(N) theory, leaving the SU(N) degrees of freedom unaffected.\nSecond, there are two separate sources of the UV/IR mixing contributing to the dispersion relation of the trace-U(1) gauge fields: the \u03a01 effects and the \u03a02 effects, as will be\nexplained momentarily.\nA study of the Wilsonian effective action, obtained by integrating out the high-energy\ndegrees of freedom using the background field method, and keeping track of the UV/IR\nmixing effects, has given strong hints in favour of a non-universality in the infrared [9; 10].\nIn particular, the polarisation tensor of the gauge bosons in a noncommutative U(N) gauge\ntheory takes form [5; 9; 10]\n\n1\n\n\u0001\nAB 2\n2\n2\nAB\n2\n2 k\u0303\u03bc k\u0303\u03bd\n\u03a0AB\n,\n\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a01 (k , k\u0303 ) k g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 k\u03bc k\u03bd + \u03a02 (k , k\u0303 )\nk\u0303 2\n\nwith k\u0303\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bd .\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe construction in [8] of correct values of hypercharges of the Standard Model from the product\ngauge group was influenced by [22]. The authors of Ref. [22] advocated a noncommutative model which\nsatisfied criteria 2, 3 and 4 listed in the beginning of this section. Their model was based on the\nnoncommutative gauge group U(3)\u00d7U(2)\u00d7U(1) with matter fields transforming only in (bi-)fundamental\nrepresentations, and remarkably, it predicted correctly the hypercharges of the Standard Model. In many\nrespects their model is similar to the bottom-up approach of [24] to the string embedding of the Standard\nModel in purely commutative settings. Unfortunately, the noncommutative U(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u00d7 U(1) model of\n[22] ignores all the effects of the UV/IR mixing which alters the infrared behavior of the U(1) hypercharge\nsector.\n\n3\n\n\fHere A, B = 0, 1, . . . N 2 \u22121 are adjoint labels of U(N) gauge fields, AA\n\u03bc , such that A, B = 0\ncorrespond to the overall U(1) subgroup, i.e. to the trace-U(1) factor. The term in\n(1.4) proportional to k\u0303\u03bc k\u0303\u03bd /k\u0303 2 would not appear in ordinary commutative theories. It\nis transverse, but not Lorentz invariant, as it explicitly depends on \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd . Nevertheless\nit is perfectly allowed in noncommutative theories. It is known that \u03a02 vanishes for\nsupersymmetric noncommutative gauge theories with unbroken supersymmetry, as was\nfirst discussed in [5].\nIn general, both \u03a01 and \u03a02 terms in (1.4) are affected by the UV/IR mixing. More\nprecisely, as already mentioned earlier, the UV/IR mixing affects specifically the \u03a001 0\ncomponents and generates the \u03a002 0 components in (1.4). The UV/IR mixing in \u03a001 0\naffects the running of the trace-U(1) coupling constant in the infrared,\n1\nb0\n= 4\u03a001 0 (k 2 , k\u0303 2 ) \u2192 \u2212\nlog k 2 ,\n2\n(4\u03c0)2\ng(k, k\u0303)U(1)\n\nas k 2 \u2192 0 ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nleading to a logarithmic decoupling of the trace-U(1) gauge fields from the SU(N) lowenergy theory, see Refs. [8; 9; 10] for more detail.\nFor nonsupersymmetric theories, \u03a002 0 can present more serious problems. In theories\nwithout supersymmetry, \u03a002 0 \u223c 1/k\u0303 2 , at small momenta, and this leads to unacceptable\nquadratic IR singularities [5]. In theories with softly broken supersymmetry (i.e. with\nmatching number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom) the quadratic singularities\nin \u03a002 0 cancel [5; 9; 10]. However, the subleading contribution \u03a002 0 \u223c const, survives\n[33] unless the supersymmetry is exact. For the rest of the paper we will concentrate\non noncommutative Standard Model candidates with softly broken supersymmetry, in\n2\n,2 as explained\norder to avoid quadratic IR divergencies. In this case, \u03a002 0 \u223c \u2206Msusy\nin [33]. The presence of such \u03a02 effects will lead to unacceptable pathologies such as\nLorentz-noninvariant dispersion relations giving mass to only one of the polarisations of\nthe trace-U(1) gauge field, leaving the other polarisation massless.\nThe presence of the UV/IR effects in the trace-U(1) factors makes it pretty clear\nthat a simple noncommutative U(1) theory taken on its own has nothing to do with\nordinary QED. The low-energy theory emerging from the noncommutative U(1) theory\nwill become free at k 2 \u2192 0 (rather than just weakly coupled) and in addition will have\nother pathologies [8; 9; 10; 33]. However, one would expect that it is conceivable to embed\na commutative SU(N) theory, such as e.g. QCD or the weak sector of the Standard Model\ninto a supersymmetric noncommutative theory in the UV, but some extra care should be\ntaken with the QED U(1) sector [8]. We will show that the only realistic way to embed\nQED into noncommutative settings is to recover the electromagnetic U(1) from a traceless\ndiagonal generator of some higher U(N) gauge theory. So it seems that in order to embed\nQED into a noncommutative theory one should learn how to embed the whole Standard\nModel [8]. We will see, however, that the additional trace-U(1) factors remaining from\n2\n\n2\n\u2206MSUSY\n=\n\n1\n2\n\nP\n\ns\n\nMs2 \u2212\n\nP\n\nf\n\nMf2 is a measure of SUSY breaking.\n\n4\n\n\fthe noncommutative U(N) groups will make the resulting low-energy theories unviable\n(at least for the general class of models considered in this paper).\nIn order to proceed we would like to disentangle the mass-effects due to the Higgs\nmechanism from the mass-effects due to non-vanishing \u03a02 . Hence we first set \u03a02 = 0\n(this can be achieved by starting with an exactly supersymmetric theory). It is then\nstraightforward to show (see Sec. 4) that the Higgs mechanism alone cannot remove all of\nthe trace-U(1) factors from the massless theory. More precisely, the following statement\nis true: Consider a scenario where a set of fundamental, bifundamental and adjoint Higgs\nfields breaks U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(Nm ) \u2192 H, such that H is non-trivial. Then there\nis at least one generator of the unbroken subgroup H with non-vanishing trace. This\ngenerator can be chosen such that it generates a U(1) subgroup.\nWe can now count all the massless U(1) factors in a generic noncommutative theory\nwith \u03a02 = 0 and after the Higgs symmetry breaking. In general we can have the following\nscenarios for massless U(1) degrees of freedom in H:\n(a) U(1)Y is traceless and in addition there is one or more factors of trace-U(1) in H.\n(b) U(1)Y arises from a mixture of traceless and trace-U(1) generators of the noncommutative product group U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(Nm ).\n(c) U(1)Y has an admixture of trace-U(1) generators as in (b) plus there are additional\nmassless trace-U(1) factors in H.\nIn the following sections we will see that none of these options lead to an acceptable\nlow-energy theory once we have switched on \u03a02 6= 0, i.e. once we have introduced mass\ndifferences between superpartners. It is well-known [5; 33] that \u03a02 6= 0 leads to strong\nLorentz symmetry violating effects in the dispersion relation of the corresponding traceU(1) vector bosons, and in particular, to mass-difference of their helicity components. If\noption (a) was realised in nature, it would lead (in addition to the standard photon) to a\nnew colourless vector field with one polarisation being massless, and one massive due to\n\u03a02 .\nThe options (b) and (c) are also not viable since an admixture of the trace-U(1)\ngenerators to the photon would also perversely affect photon polarisations and make\nsome of them massive3 .\n3\n\nOne could hope that the trace-U(1) factors could be made massive at the string scale by working\nin a theory where these factors are anomalous. Then one could use the Green-Schwarz mechanism [34]\nto cancel the anomaly and simultaneously give a large stringy mass to these U(1) factors. This scenario\nwhich is often appealed to in ordinary commutative theories to remove unwanted U(1) factors cannot\nbe used in the noncommutative setting. The reason is that at scales above the noncommutative mass,\nthe noncommutative gauge invariance requires the gauge group to be U(N ). It cannot become just an\nSU(N ) theory (above the noncommutative scale) and remain noncommutative, see e.g. [21]. Therefore\nwe require vector-like theories as stated in item 5.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the rest of the paper we will explain these observations in more detail.\nWe end this section with some general comments on noncommutative Standard Modelling. This paper refines the earlier analysis of [8]. In that work the trace-U(1) factors\nwere assumed to be completely decoupled in the extreme infrared and, hence, were neglected. However, it is important to keep in mind that the decoupling of the trace-U(1)'s\nis logarithmic and hence slow. Even in presence of a huge hierarchy between the noncommutative mass scale MNC , say of the order of the Planck scale MP \u223c 1019 GeV, and the\nscale \u039b \u223c (10\u221214 \u2212 109 ) eV (electroweak and QCD scale, respectively), where the SU(N)\nsubgroup becomes strong, the ratio\n\u0010 2\u0011\n2\nlog \u039bk 2\ngU(1)\n\u0010 4 \u0011 & 10\u22123\n\u223c\n(1.6)\n2\nM\ngSU(N\n)\nlog \u039b2NC\nk2\n\nis not negligible. In particular, the above inequality holds for any MNC > k & 2\u039b. Hence\nthe complete decoupling of the trace-U(1) degrees of freedom at small non-zero momenta\ndoes not appear to be fully justified and the trace-U(1) would leave its traces in scattering\nexperiments at accessible momentum scales k \u223c 1 eV\u22121010 eV (see Sec. 2 for more detail).\n\n2\n\nUV/IR mixing and properties of the trace-U(1)\n\nUV/IR mixing manifests itself only in the trace-U(1) part of the full noncommutative\nU(N). For this part it strongly affects \u03a01 and is responsible for the generation of nonvanishing \u03a02 (if SUSY is not exact). In this section we will briefly review how the UV/IR\nmixing arises in the trace-U(1) sector and how this leads us to rule out options (a) and\n(c) discussed in Sec. 1.\n\n2.1\n\nRunning gauge coupling\n\nFollowing Refs. [9; 10], we will consider a U(N) noncommutative theory with matter\nfields transforming in the adjoint and fundamental representations of the gauge group.\nWe use the background field method, decomposing the gauge field A\u03bc = B\u03bc + N\u03bc into a\nbackground field B\u03bc and a fluctuating quantum field N\u03bc , and the appropriate background\nversion of Feynman gauge, to determine the effective action Seff (B) by functionally integrating over the fluctuating fields.\nTo determine the effective gauge coupling in the background field method, it suffices\nto study the terms quadratic in the background field. In the effective action these take\n\n6\n\n\fthe following form (capital letters denote full U(N) indices and run from 0 to N 2 \u2212 1) 4 ,\nZ\nd4 k A\nB\u03bc (k)B\u03bdB (\u2212k)\u03a0AB\n(2.1)\nSeff \u220b 2\n\u03bc\u03bd (k).\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n2\nAB\nAt tree level, \u03a0AB\n/g02 is the standard transverse tensor originating\n\u03bc\u03bd = (k g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 k\u03bc k\u03bd ) \u03b4\nfrom the gauge kinetic term. In a commutative theory, gauge and Lorentz invariance\nrestrict the Lorentz structure to be identical to the one of the tree level term. In noncommutative theories, Lorentz invariance is violated by \u03b8. The most general allowed structure\nis then given by Eq. (1.4). The second term may lead to the strong Lorentz violation\nmentioned in the introduction. This term is absent in supersymmetric theories [5; 9].\n\nLet us start with a discussion of the effects noncommutativity has on \u03a01 and the\nrunning of the gauge coupling. That is, for the moment, we postpone the study of \u03a02 effects by considering a model with unbroken supersymmetry5 . As usual, we define the\nrunning gauge coupling as\n\u0012 \u0013AB \u0012 \u0013AB\n1\n1\n+ 4\u03a0AB\n(2.2)\n=\n1 loop (k).\n2\n2\ng\ng0\nwhere g02 is the microscopic coupling (i.e. the tree level contribution) and \u03a0loop includes\nonly the contributions from loop diagrams. Henceforth, we will drop the loop subscript.\nTo evaluate \u03a0 at one loop order one has to evaluate the appropriate Feynman diagrams.\nThe effects of noncommutativity appear via additional phase factors \u223c exp(i p2k\u0303 ) in the\nloop-integrals. Using trigonometric relations one can group the integrals into terms where\nthese factors combine to unity, the so called planar parts, and those where they yield\n\u223c cos(pk\u0303), the so called non-planar parts.\nFor fields in the fundamental representation, the phase factors cancel exactly6 and\nonly the planar part is non-vanishing. Fundamental fields therefore contribute as in\nthe commutative theory [9]. In all loop integrals7 involving adjoint fields one finds the\nfollowing factor [10],\nM AB (k, p) = (\u2212d sin\n\nk p\u0303\nk p\u0303\nk p\u0303\nk p\u0303\n+ f cos )ALM (d sin\n+ f cos )BM L .\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nUsing trigonometric and group theoretic relations this collapses to\n\n4\n\nM AB (k, p) = \u2212N \u03b4 AB (1 \u2212 \u03b40A cos k p\u0303).\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe use euclidean momenta when appropriate and the analytic continuation when considering the\nequations of motion in subsection 2.2.\n5\nNevertheless, we will give general expressions for \u03a01 valid also in the non-supersymmetric case.\n6\nOne may roughly imagine that for each fundamental field that appears in a Feynman diagram there\nis also the complex conjugate field which cancels the exponential factor.\n7\nTo keep the equations simple we consider in this section a situation where all particles of a given spin\nand representation have equal diagonal masses. Please note that the masses for fermions and bosons in\nthe same representation may be different as required for SUSY breaking.\n\n7\n\n\fj=\n\u03b1j\nCj\ndj\n\nscalar\n-1\n0\n1\n\nWeyl fermion\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n2\n\ngauge boson\n\u2212 21\n2\n4\n\nghost\n1\n0\n1\n\nTable 1: Coefficients appearing in the evaluation of the loop diagrams.\nWe can now easily see that all effects from UV/IR mixing, marked by the presence of the\ncos k p\u0303, appear only in the trace-U(1) part of the gauge group. The planar parts, however,\nare equal for the U(1) and SU(N) parts.\nSumming everything up we find the planar contribution (the coefficients \u03b1j , Cj , dj are\ngiven in Table 1 and C(r) is the Casimir operator in the representation r)\n\u0012X\n\u0014\n8\n2\n2\n\u03b1j C(r) 2Cj + dj\n(2.5)\n\u03a01 planar (k ) = \u2212\n2\n(4\u03c0)\n9\nj,r\n\u0015\u0013\nZ 1\n\u0001\nA(k 2 , x, m2j,r )\n2\n+\ndx Cj \u2212 (1 \u2212 2x) dj log\n,\n\u039b2\n0\n\nwhere mj,r is the mass of a spin j particle belonging to the representation r of the gauge\ngroup,\nA(k 2 , x, m2j,r ) = k 2 x(1 \u2212 x) + m2j,r ,\n(2.6)\nand \u039b appears via dimensional transmutation similar to \u039bMS in QCD. We have chosen\nthe renormalisation scheme, i.e. the finite constants, such that \u03a01 planar vanishes at k = \u039b.\nFor the trace-U(1) part the nonplanar parts do not vanish and we find\n\u03a01 nonplanar =\n\nwith\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u03a0\u0302\n\u2212\n\u03a0\u0303\n,\n2k 2\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ 1\n\u221a\nC(G) 8dj\n2\n\u2212 k [12Cj \u2212 dj ]\n,\ndx K0 ( A|k\u0303|)\n\u03a0\u0302 =\n(4\u03c0)2 k\u0303 2\n0\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013Z 1\n\u221a\n\u22022\n4C(G) dj\n2\n\u2212 Cj k \u2212 d j\n\u03a0\u0303 =\ndx K0 ( A|k\u0303|) ,\n(4\u03c0)2 k\u0303 2\n\u2202 2 |k\u0303|\n0\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nwhere C(G) = N is the Casimir operator in the adjoint representation.\nFor illustration, we plot in Fig. 1 the coupling (2.2) for a toy model which is a supersymmetric U(2) gauge theory with two matter multiplets and all masses (of all fields)\ntaken to be equal. We observe that even for large masses the running of the U(1) part\n(solid lines) does not stop in the infrared.

For larger masses the running stops at the mass\n4\nscale m2 only to resume running at a scale \u223c MNC\n/m2 which is, of course, again due\nto the nonplanar parts. The dashed lines in Fig. 1 give the running of the SU(2) part\nwhich receives no nonplanar contributions and behaves like in an ordinary commutative\ntheory. For m2 = 0 the SU(2) gauge coupling reaches a Landau pole at k = \u039b, for all non\nvanishing masses the running stops at the mass scale. We observe that the ratio between\nthe SU(2) coupling and the trace-U(1) coupling is not incredibly small over a wide range\nof scales, in support of our assertion (1.6) in Sec. 1.\nFurther support comes from looking at the following approximate form for the running\n2\nof the gauge coupling.

The effective coupling g depends on\nthe momentum k.\nTo conclude this subsection, let us point out that, in a scattering experiment (as\ndepicted in Fig. 2), k is really the scale of the internal momentum, and therefore, nonvanishing. k\u0303, too, is non-vanishing in appropriate (remember that we have Lorentz symmery violation) directions of t-channel scattering.\n\n2.2\n\nThe effects of a non vanishing \u03a02 from SUSY breaking\n\nIn the previous subsection we made \u03a02 vanish by working in a supersymmetric theory.\nLet us now study, what happens, when supersymmetry is (softly) broken.\nLooking only at the trace-U(1) degrees of freedom of a generic noncommutative theory\nwe have\n\u0015\nX \u00141\n\u03a02 =\n\u03b1j (3\u03a0\u0303j \u2212 \u03a0\u0302j ) .\n(2.17)\n2\nj\nOne easily checks that\n\n\u03a02 \u223c\n\nX\n\n\u03b1j dj f (k 2 , k\u0303 2 , mj ).\n\n(2.18)\n\nj\n\nIf SUSY is unbroken, all masses are equal.

In this frame, we assume that the only\nnon-vanishing components of \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd are\n\u03b813 = \u2212\u03b831 = \u03b8.\n\n(2.24)\n\nThis yields,\nk\u0303\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bd = (0, \u03b8k 3 , 0, 0),\n\nk\u0303 2 = (\u03b8k 3 )2 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nWe start with the ordinary transverse components of A\u03bd ,\nA\u03bd1 = (0, 1, 0, 0).\n\n(2.26)\n\n(\u03a01 k 2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 \u03a02 )A1,\u03bd = 0.\n\n(2.27)\n\nIn this direction, (2.22) yields\n\nIn the other transverse direction,\nA\u03bc2 = (0, 0, 1, 0),\n\n(2.28)\n\n(\u03a01 k 2 \u2212 m2 )A2,\u03bd .\n\n(2.29)\n\nwe find\nFinally we have the third polarisation (which can be gauged away if and only if m2 = 0),\nA\u03bc = (a, 0, 0, b),\n12\n\nk0 a \u2212 k3b = 0\n\n(2.30)\n\n\fwhich results in\n(\u03a01 k 2 \u2212 m2 )A3,\u03bd .\n\n(2.31)\n\nWe note that the different polarisation states do not mix due to the presence of \u03a02 . The\nsecond and the third polarisation state behave more or less like in the ordinary commutative case. However, the first has a modified equation of motion, (2.27), in presence of a\nnon-vanishing \u03a02 10 .\nThis is another strong argument against a trace-U(1) being the photon [33]. If the\ngauge symmetry is unbroken and m2 = 0 we usually have two massless polarisations.\nHowever, a non vanishing \u03a02 reduces this to one. The other one gets an additional mass\n\u03a02 . Since only one polarisation is affected this is a strong Lorentz symmetry violating\neffect. Moreover, a negative \u03a02 would lead to tachyons while a positive mass is phenomenologically ruled out by the constraint [35]\nm\u03b3 < 6 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV\n\n(2.32)\n\non the photon mass11 .\nIf we take the trace-U(1) as an additional (to the photon) gauge boson from the\nunbroken subgroup H, we would still get strong Lorentz symmetry violation since the\ntrace-U(1) is not completely decoupled.\nIn summary, we found in this section that additional trace-U(1) subgroups are not\ncompletely decoupled and should lead to observable effects. In particular, if SUSY is not\nexact we have non-vanishing \u03a02 which gives rise to strong Lorentz symmetry violation\nwhich has not been observed. This rules out possibilities (a) and (c) of Sec. 1. Moreover,\nwe confirmed that a trace-U(1) is not suitable as a photon candidate.\n\n3\n\nMixing of trace and traceless parts\n\nFrom the previous section we concluded that the trace-U(1) groups are unviable as candidates for the SM photon. Therefore, it has been suggested to construct the photon from\ntraceless U(1) subgroups [8]. It turns out, however, that typically trace and traceless\nparts mix and the trace parts contribute their Lorentz symmetry violating properties to\nthe mixed particle.\n10\n\nOne might argue that instead of Eq. (2.27) one has to use the rescaled equation (we set m2 = 0\n\u03a02 (k2 ,k\u03032 )\n= 0. For k 2 \u2192 0, the second term vanishes since \u03a01 diverges in this limit.\nfor simplicity) k 2 \u2212 \u03a0\n2  \u03032\n1 (k ,k )\nTherefore, we find an additional solution. However, this solution is rather strange. It does not correspond\nto a pole in the propagator (it goes like a log). Moreover, if one calculates the cross section \u03a02 still upsets\nthe angular dependence quite severely compared to the ordinary commutative case.\n11\nEven fine-tuning of (2.20) to zero is not an option. Since we have only a finite number of masses\nthis is at best possible for a finite number of values of |k\u0303| and we will surely find values of |k\u0303| where \u03a02\nis nonzero.\n\n13\n\n\fFor U(2) broken by a fundamental Higgs, the standard Higgs mechanism yields the\nsymmetry breaking U(2) \u2192 U(1). However, the remaining U(1) is a mixture of trace and\ntraceless parts. If SUSY is broken, the trace-U(1) has a \u03a02 part in the polarisation tensor.\nTaking this into account we find the following matrix for the equations of motion\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb U(1) 2\n2\n2\n\u03a01\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nk \u2212 \u03a02 \u2212 m\nm2\n\nm\n\nSU(2) 2\n\n\u03a01\n\nk \u2212 m2\n\nU(1) 2\n\n\u03a01\n\nk \u2212 m2\n\nm2\n\nm2\n\nSU(2) 2\n\n\u03a01\n\nk \u2212 m2\n\nU(1) 2\nk \u2212 m2\n\u03a01\n2\n\nm\n\n2\n\nm\n\nSU(2) 2\n\n\u03a01\n\nk \u2212 m2\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere the adjoint U(2) and polarisation indices are (0, 1), (3, 1), (0, 2), (3, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3).\nWe omitted the values 1 and 2 for the adjoint U(2) indices which do not mix with the\ntrace-U(1) and are not qualitatively different from the commutative case.\nThe matrix is block diagonal and the second and third polarisation (lower right corner)\nbehave more or less like their commutative counterparts. We can concentrate on the upper\nleft 2 \u00d7 2 matrix corresponding to the transverse polarisations affected by \u03a02 .\nThis 2 \u00d7 2 matrix admits two solutions for the equations of motion. Expanding for\nsmall \u03a02 we find,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nU(1)\nSU(N )\nk 2 = \u03a02 + O(\u03a022 ),\n(3.2)\n\u03a01 + \u03a01\n\u00112\n\u0010\nU(1)\nSU(N )\nSU(N )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03a01 + \u03a01\n\u03a01\nU(1)\nSU(N )\n2\n2\n\u03a01 + \u03a01\nk =\nm + U(1) \u03a02 + O(\u03a022 ),\nU(1) SU(N )\n\u03a01 \u03a01\n\u03a01\nin analogy to (2.27). In absence of \u03a02 the first solution in Eq. (3.2) is a massless one\ncorresponding to the massless combination of gauge bosons (think of it as the photon).\nThe second is a massive combination (similar to the Z boson). The presence of non2\nvanishing \u03a02 again leads to a mass \u03a0\u03a0U(1)\nfor the first solution and rules out the \"massless\"\ncombination as a reasonable photon candidate.\nThis example demonstrates that the disastrous effects of \u03a02 are also present in any\ncombination which has an admixture of trace-U(1) degrees of freedom. Hence, this rules\nout possibilities (b) and (c) from the introduction.\n\n4\n\nTrace-U(1) factors in the unbroken subgroup\n\nIn the previous section, we learned in a specific example that even a small admixture of\na trace part spoils the masslessness of the gauge boson corresponding to the unbroken\ngauge symmetry. This shows that a viable photon candidate must have a generator with\nvanishing (small is not enough) trace.\n14\n\n\fIn our U(2) example with the gauge symmetry broken by a fundamental Higgs field\nthe trace does not vanish. The generator corresponding to the unbroken U(1) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u223c\n,\n(4.1)\n0 0\nwhich obviously has non-vanishing trace.\nOne can try to construct other symmetry breaking mechanisms with larger groups\nand products of groups as well as the other representations for the Higgs fields allowed\nby the condition 3 of the introduction. However, one always encounters one of the following situations. Either the remaining U(1) has a generator with non-vanishing trace or\nthere is more than one unbroken U(1) subgroup. Both situations are in contradiction of\nobservations, as our discussion of the previous sections shows.\nThis is generalised and more precisely formulated by the following proposition (already\nstated in the introduction): Consider a scenario where a set of fundamental, bifundamental and adjoint Higgs fields breaks U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(Nm ) \u2192 H, such that H is\nnon-trivial. Then there is at least one generator of the unbroken subgroup H with nonvanishing trace. This generator can be chosen such that it generates a U(1) subgroup.\nLet us now turn to a proof of the proposition. Let us start with the simple situation\nof one U(N) group. Since we have only one group, we have only fundamental and adjoint\nHiggs fields at our disposal. We proceed by switching on one Higgs field (component)\nafter the other. Let us start with the fundamental field. U(N) symmetry allows us to\nchose this field as\n\u03c6f = (0, . . . , 0, a)T .\n(4.2)\nCase 1: If a = 0 we have no breaking with a fundamental Higgs. In this case we are\nfinished, because the generator of the original trace-U(1) is proportional to the N \u00d7 N\nunit matrix and therefore commutes with any adjoint Higgs field. Therefore this generator\ncontinues to generate an unbroken trace-U(1) subgroup, as stated in the proposition.\nCase 2: If a 6= 0 gauge symmetry is broken down to the U(N \u22121) living in the upper N \u22121\ncomponents of any field. A set of generators for this group are the ordinary U(N \u2212 1)\nin the upper left (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 (N \u2212 1) submatrix and zero in the other components. In\nparticular, there is a new trace-U(1) with generator\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n1\nTtrace = \uf8ec\n(4.3)\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n1\n0\nUnder this subgroup an adjoint field decomposes into\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u03c6ad \u03c62f\n\u03c6ad =\n,\n(\u03c62f )\u2020 \u03c62s\n15\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fwhere \u03c62ad , \u03c62f and \u03c62s are adjoint, fundamental and singlett fields under the remaining\nU(N \u2212 1) symmetry. An additional fundamental field \u03c6\u0302f decomposes as\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u03c6\u0302f\n\u03c6\u0302f =\n(4.5)\n\u03c6\u03022s\ninto an additional fundamental \u03c6\u03022f and another singlett \u03c6\u03022s . We can now repeat the\nargument for the remaining U(N \u2212 1) group starting, again, with the fundamental fields.\nThis procedure has to stop at some point, i.e. at one point the fundamental \u03c6nf has to be\nzero, or the symmetry is broken completely and H would be the trivial group in violation\nof the assumptions.\nFor a product of more than one group the proof is analogous only that we have\nadditional bifundamental fields. Let us briefly consider the situation with a product of\ntwo groups U(M) \u00d7 U(N). Switching on fundamental fields we can end up with:\nCase 1: If all fundamentals are zero the symmetry remains unbroken U(M) \u00d7 U(N). One\ncan easily see that bifundamental and adjoint fields cannot break the trace-U(1) generated\nby the (N + M) \u00d7 (N + M) unit matrix12 .\nCase 2: Let us switch on one fundamental field. Without loss of generality we can take\nit to be an N fundamental. The symmetry is broken down to U(M) \u00d7 U(N \u2212 1) with a\nnew trace-U(1) for the U(N \u2212 1) in analogy to the simple U(N) situation discussed above.\nAll fields transforming under the U(M) remain unaffected. The fundamental and adjoint\nfields for U(N) are decomposed according to Eqs. (4.4),(4.5). Finally the bifundamental\ndecomposes as\n\u0001\n(4.6)\n\u03c6b = \u03c62b \u03c62b, f\n\ninto a bifundamental \u03c62b under U(M) \u00d7 U(N \u2212 1) and a fundamental \u03c62b, f under U(N \u2212 1).\nThe argument proceeds by induction. The case of more than two U(N) factors is completely analogous.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nNoncommutative gauge symmetry in the Weyl-Moyal approach leads to two main features\nwhich have to be taken into account for sensible model building. First, there are strong\nconstraints on the dynamics and the field content. The only allowed gauge groups are\nU(N). In addition, the matter fields are restricted to transform as fundamental, bifundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group. Finally, anomaly freedom for\n12\n\nWe can think of U(M ) \u00d7 U(N ) embedded into U(N + M ) \u00d7 U(N + M )\n\n16\n\n\fnoncommutative theories requires the theory to be vector like13 . Second, there are the\neffects of ultraviolet/infrared mixing. Those lead to asymptotic infrared freedom of the\ntrace-U(1) subgroup and, if the model does not have unbroken supersymmetry, to Lorentz\nsymmetry violating terms in the polarisation tensor for this trace-U(1) subgroup.\nWe have demonstrated that, although the trace-U(1) decouples in the limit k \u2192 0,\nthe coupling is not negligibly small at finite momentum scales k, as they appear, for\nexample, in scattering experiments. Therefore, observations rule out additional unbroken\n(massless) trace-U(1) subgroups. An example is the model considered in Ref. [8]. In\nRef. [8], the trace-U(1) groups were completely discarded before the symmetry breaking\nscheme was discussed. A more careful investigation which takes takes into account these\nsubgroups yields the symmetry breaking U(4) \u00d7 U(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u2192 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 (U(1))4\ninstead of U(4) \u00d7 U(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u2192 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). Therefore we have superfluous\nU(1) subgroups. Following the above lines explicitely one easily finds that one of the\nU(1)'s has a generator which is proportional to the 9 \u00d7 9 unity matrix.\nNoncommutativity explicitly breaks Lorentz invariance. Therefore an additional\nLorentz symmetry violating structure is allowed in the polarisation tensor. This structure is absent only in supersymmetric models. If supersymmetry is (softly) broken, this\nadditional structure is present in the polarisation tensor of the trace-U(1). It leads to\n2\nan additional mass \u223c \u2206MSUSY\nfor one of the transverse polarisation states [33]. The\ntight constraints on the photon mass therefore exclude trace-U(1)'s as a candidate for\nthe photon. It turns out that even a small admixture of a trace part to a traceless part\n(unaffected by these problems) is fatal. The only way out seems to be the construction\nof the photon from a completely traceless generator. A group theoretic argument shows,\nthat this is impossible whithout having additional unbroken U(1) subgroups. However,\nthose are already excluded from the arguments given above.\nThis result severely restricts the possibilities to construct a noncommutative Standard\nmodel extension. If all of the constraints given at the beginning are fulfilled the noncommutativity scale is pushed to scales far beyond MP . This is to be compared to the less\nrestrictive constraints MNC & 0.1\u221210 TeV (conservative estimate) obtained from tree level\namplitudes [36] or from an approach where a Taylor expansion in the noncommutativity\nparameters is used before quantization, thereby ignoring effects of ultraviolet/infrared\nmixing and possibly constraints on the field content [6; 7; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32].\nWe stress, however, that the latter approach may lead to a completely different quantum\ntheory and therefore our bounds may not be applicable.\nWe would like to conclude with a more optimistic prospect.\nIn general there is no reason to assume that the simple noncommutative model used\nhere describes correctly the physics at energies ranging from a few eV up to the Planck\n13\nIn turn, this eliminates the Green-Schwarz mechanism [34] as a possible source for a (large) mass\nterm for the trace-U(1) part of the gauge group.\n\n17\n\n\fmass. In fact, due to the ultraviolet/infrared mixing, a different ultraviolet embedding of\nthe theory would modify the theory not only in the ultraviolet, but also in the infrared\nwhich can drastically alter our conclusions [23]. In particular, our conclusions are tied\nto a slow logarithmic decoupling of the trace-U(1), but if it is changed to a power-like\ndecoupling, the U(1) factors would safely decouple and leave the Standard Model in\npeace. We expect that this can be achieved by embedding the noncommutative theory\ninto a higher dimensional theory in the ultraviolet (which will have a power-like beta\nfunction) and then appeal to the ultraviolet/infrared mixing to transport this power-like\nbehaviour to the infrared region for the trace-U(1) gauge coupling (see later work [23]).\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Steve Abel and J\u00fcrgen Reuter for useful discussions. VVK\nacknowledges the support of PPARC through a Senior Fellowship.\n\nA\n\nPolarsation directions in gauge theories\n\nIn this section we review some basics about the counting of degrees of freedom in gauge\ntheories. In particular, we show how gauge invariance reduces the number of degrees of\nfreedom from the naive 4 (4 components of the vector field) to 2 and 3 for the massless\nand massive case, respectively.\n\nA.1\n\nThe massless case\n\nIn ordinary QED, the field equations read\n\u0003A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bd A\u03bd ) = 0.\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0\n\n(A.2)\n\nUsing Lorentz gauge,\nEq. (A.1) simplifies to the wave equation\n\u0003A\u03bc = 0.\n\n(A.3)\n\nA\u03bc = C\u01eb\u03bc exp(ikx),\n\n(A.4)\n\nWriting\nany \u01eb\u03bc is a solution to (A.3) as long as\nk 2 = 0.\n\n18\n\n(A.5)\n\n\fSo far we have all 4 polarisations. However, (A.2) implies 4-dimensional transversality,\nk\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc = 0,\n\n(A.6)\n\nand reduces the allowed number of polarisations to three. This is still more than the two\npolarisation states a photon should have.\nHowever, Lorentz gauge does not completely fix the gauge. We can still use a gauge\ntransformation \u03a9 with \u0003\u03a9 = 0. This allows us to choose A0 = 0. Together with (A.6)\nthis leads us to the ordinary 3-dimensional transversality,\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\nk *\u2192\n\u01eb = 0.\n\nA.2\n\n(A.7)\n\nThe case with a Higgs field\n\nThe presence of a Higgs field modifies (A.1),\n\u0003A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bd A\u03bd ) + m2 A\u03bc + m\u2202 \u03bc \u03c62 = 0.\n\n(A.8)\n\nMoreover it supplies an additional equation for the Goldstone boson \u03c62 ,\n\u0003\u03c62 + m\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0.\n\n(A.9)\n\nOne convenient choice of gauge is unitary gauge where\n\u03c62 = 0.\n\n(A.10)\n\nWe stress from the beginning that unitary gauge implies (A.2), as can be seen from (A.9).\nIn this gauge Eq. (A.8) simplifies,\n\u0003A\u03bc + m2 A\u03bc = 0.\n\n(A.11)\n\nNow everything runs in a similar fashion to the massless case, only that\nk 2 \u2212 m2 = 0.\n\n(A.12)\n\nThe important difference is that unitary gauge fixes the gauge completely. We cannot\nmake an additional gauge choice. Therefore it is impossible to get rid of the 3rd polarisation state which satisfies Lorentz gauge k\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc = 0. Stated differently we cannot require\n3-dimensional transversality for \u01eb\u03bc and we have therefore three allowed polarisation states\nwith equal masses.\n\n19\n\n\fReferences\n[1] N.
