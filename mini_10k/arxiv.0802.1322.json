Introduction\nThe first spatial oscillations of coronal loops were discovered in extreme ultraviolet (171 \u00c5) by Aschwanden et al. (1999a). Using a MHD wave theory developed\nby Edwin & Roberts (1983), Aschwanden et al. (1999b) and Nakariakov et al.\n(1999) interpreted them as the fundamental fast (kink) mode of coronal loops.\nSubsequently, Wang et al. (2003) observed frequency spectrum of the standing\nslow modes of the loops.\nSince then theoreticians have been supplementing the observed data, oscillation periods, loop lengths, etc., with plausible auxiliary parameters, such as\nplasma density, magnetic field strength and configuration, etc., with the aim of\nobtaining reasonably realistic models for the structure of the loops (Bennett et\n1 Zanjan\n\nUniversity, Zanjan 45195, Iran,\nfor Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences, Gava\nZang, Po. Box 45195-1159, Zanjan, Iran\n2 Institute\n\n\fDadashi et al.\n\nal., 1998; Verwichte et al., 2004; D\u0131\u0301az et al., 2002, 2004; Van Doorsselaere et al.,\n2004; Andries et al., 2005a, b, Arregui et al., 2005; Dymova & Ruderman, 2005;\nErd\u00e9lyi & Fedun, 2006; D\u0131\u0301az & Roberts, 2006; McEwan et al., 2006; Donnelly\net al., 2006; Erd\u00e9lyi & Verth 2007; Dymova & Ruderman, 2005; Dymova &\nRuderman, 2006; Verth et al., 2007 Doorsselaere et al., 2007; Erd\u00e9lyi & Verth,\n2007; Safari et al., 2007; Karami & Asvar 2007).\nIn their recent work, Dymova & Ruderman (2005) and Safari et al. (2007)\nreduce the MHD wave equations to a single Sturm-Liouville equation for the zcomponent of the perturbation in the magnetic field. Here, we use the formalism\nof Safari et al. and show that, for an exponential plasma density stratification\nalong the loop axis, the problem has a closed analytical solution. The loop model,\nequations of motion, and boundary conditions are presented in Sec. 2. The closed\nsolutions, including the dispersion relation, are treated in Sec 3. Concluding\nremarks are given in Sec. 4.\n\n2. Description of the model and equations of motion\nA coronal loop is approximated by a cylinder of length L and radius R. Loop ends\nare fixed at the photosphere. Loop curvature is neglected, on account of R << L.\nNo initial flow is assumed inside the loop. A uniform magnetic field along the\naxis pervades the loop, B = B \u1e91. Gas pressure, gravity and all dissipative and\nviscous forces are neglected. The density is discontinuous on the lateral surface\nof the cylinder and varies exponentially along the axis. Thus,\n\u03c1(r, z, \u03b5) = \u03c1i (\u03b5) exp(\u2212\u03b5z/L), 0 \u2264 z \u2264 L/2, inside tube,\n= \u03c1e (\u03b5) exp(\u2212\u03b5z/L),\n\noutside tube,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the density scale height parameter, and \u03c1i , \u03c1e are the interior and\nexterior footpoint densities, respectively. The assumption of exponential density\nis in accord with the findings of Aschwanden et al. (1999). They conclude this\nfrom their stereoscopic analysis of 30 loop oscillations in EUV. Restriction of z\nto the interval [0 \u2212 L/2] is permissible on account of the symmetry of the loop\nconfiguration about its midpoint\nThe linearized ideal MHD equations are\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207.(\u03c1\u03b4v) = 0,\n\u2202t\n1\n\u2202\u03b4v\n=\n(\u2207 \u00d7 \u03b4B) \u00d7 B,\n\u2202t\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n\u2202\u03b4B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b4v \u00d7 B),\n\u2202t\n\u2207. \u03b4B = 0,\n\nContinuity Equation,\n\n(2)\n\nMomentum Equation,\n\n(3)\n\nInduction Equation\n\n(4)\n\nSolenoidal Constraint,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b4v and \u03b4B are the Eulerian perturbations in the velocity and magnetic\nfields, respectively.

The ratio of two even modes, however, begins decreasing\nquadratically with \u03b5. These features are also seen on the diagrams of Fig 3b.\nObservational verification of these points, however, has to await the availability\nof more extended and higher resolutions data. Presently only two frequencies in\nthree loops are available ( Verwitche et al. 2004, Van Doorsselaere 2007).\n2.0.2. Arbitrary stratification - Numerical approach\nWe use Newton-Raphson's numerical method to solve Eqs. (12) and (13) for the\neigenfrequencies. In the range, 0 < \u03b5 = L/H < 20, the fundamental and three\nhigher kink frequencies, \u03c9n , n = 2, 3, and 4, and the ratios, \u03c9n /\u03c91 , are computed.\nThe data are plotted in Fig. 3 for two density contrasts, \u03c1e (\u03b5)/\u03c1i (\u03b5) = 0.1 and\n0.5. As the density contrast increases the frequencies shift down. Their ratios,\nhowever, remain unchanged. The ratio \u03c9n /\u03c91 begins with n and decreases with\nincreasing \u03b5, in compliance with Eqs. (16).\n\nanal_sol.tex; 16/11/2018; 13:19; p.5\n\n\fDadashi et al.\n\nAndries et al. (2005b) maintain that the frequency ratios could be used as\na seismological tool to estimate the coronal density scale heights. From the\nTRACE data, Verwichte et al. (2004) find the ratio \u03c92 /\u03c91 to be 1.64 and 1.81\nfor loops designated by D and C in their records, respectively. Van Doorsselaere,\nNakariakov, & Verwichte (2007) revisited the same ratios from the observational\ndata to be 1.58 and 1.82 for the same loops, respectively, and 1.795 for another\nloop in their current analysis. With the help of Fig. 1, we find the corresponding\n\u03b5 to be 4.98 and 1.9, respectively. Assuming typical loop lengths, L = 100 \u2212 400\nMm, the density scale heights fall in the range of H = \u03b5\u22121 L \u2243 20\u221282 and 53\u2212210\nMm, respectively. These scale heights are slightly different from the findings of\nAndries et al. (2005a,b) and Safari et al. (2007) for a sinusoidal density profile.\nA noteworthy point is the effect of column mass on frequencies. In Fig. 1\nwe assume a constant footpoint density contrast, \u03c1e /\u03c1i = 0.1, and vary \u03b5. Consequently, the total column mass of the loop changes. Compared with variable\ndensity contrast but fixed column mass, the mode profiles and the frequency\nratios remain unchanged. The frequencies themselves, however, behave slightly\ndifferently. For variable column mass models, the frequencies increase more\nsharply with \u03b5.\nThe mode profiles, Z(z) of Eq. (8), are shown in Fig. 2 for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nFor the unstratified case, \u03b5 = 0, the profiles are sinusoidal. With increasing \u03b5,\nthey depart from the sine curves. Antinodes shift toward the footpoints. Stronger\nthe stratification, the greater the shift is, in agreement with the findings of Safari\net al. (2007) and Verth et al. (2007). Van Doorsselaere et al. (2007) point out, the\nshift of the antinodes is potentially, a coronal seismological tool to estimate the\nAn\ndensity scale heights. In Fig. 3, we have plotted the antinode shift, z\u03b5An \u2212 z\u03b5=0\n, of\nthe first overtone versus \u03b5. The shift \u2248 0.02\u03b5, grows approximately linearly with\n\u03b5. Our numerical result shows that, the shift in the antinode for different density\ncontrasts , \u03c1e /\u03c1i = 0.1 and 0.5, are the same. For typical loops, of lengths\n100 \u2212 400 Mm and density scale heights, H = 50 and 100 Mm, the antinode\nAn\nAn\nshift falls in the range 2.85 \u2264 z\u03b5An \u2212 z\u03b5=0\n\u2264 56.64 Mm and 1.35 \u2264 z\u03b5An \u2212 z\u03b5=0\n\u2264\n25.12 Mm, respectively. Observation wise, the resolution of current solar satellite\nfacilities, e.g., TRACE, SDO, SO, etc., seems adequate to detect such antinode\nshifts and estimate the density scale height of solar coronae. Verth et al. (2007)\nstudy semi circular loops of sinusoidal density profiles and find the antinode\nshifts \u2248 0.028\u03b5.\nOur numerical results show that, for a given \u03b5, the mode profiles are insensitive\nto changes in density contrast, \u03c1e (\u03b5)/\u03c1i (\u03b5). The differences between the mode\nprofiles of the stratified and unstratified cases, \u2206Zn = Zn (\u03b5, z) \u2212 Zn (\u03b5 = 0, z),\nn = 1, 2, 3, and 4 are plotted in Fig. 4. Erd\u00e9lyi & Verth (2007) maintains that\nthese differences in the mode profile are so small to be resolved by current EUV\ninstruments of TRACE mission.\nAnother interesting point is negative scale heights, suggested by Andries\n(2005a,b) on the basis of the error bars in the observations of Verwichte et\nal. (2004). Here, the density at the apex is higher than at footpoints. Unlike the\npositive scale scale height case: a) \u03c91 decreases with increasing |\u03b5|, see Fig. 5; b)\nhigher overtones, \u03c9n , n = 2, 3, * * *, however, increase with |\u03b5|, though at slower\n\nanal_sol.tex; 16/11/2018; 13:19; p.6\n\n\fExact solutions of standing kink modes\n0.2\n0.18\n0.16\n\nzAn\n\u2212 zAn\n\u03b5\n\u03b5=0\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nAn , (normalized to L) against \u03b5.

Conclusions\nSuggested theoretical models of 3D coronal loops are, still, far from the realities.\nMany complicating factors, such as variable cross sections, variable magnetic\nfields, non-zero \u03b2 plasmas, etc., are to be accounted for in a realistic study of\nboth the equilibrium structure and the perturbed state of actual loops. Here,\nwe study the oscillations of loops with exponential density variations along the\nloop axis.\n\nanal_sol.tex; 16/11/2018; 13:19; p.7\n\n\fDadashi et al.\n30\n\u03c1e/\u03c1i = 0.1\n\u03c1e/\u03c1i = 0.5\n\n25\n\n\u03c9\n\n4\n\n\u03c9\n\n20\n\n\u03c9\n\n3\n\n15\n\n10\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c9\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03b5\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 5. For the case of negative scale heights, the frequencies plotted versus \u03b5, for two\ndifferent density contrast, \u03c1e /\u03c1i = 0.1 (solid lines) and \u03c1e /\u03c1i = 0.5 (dotted lines).\n\n- Analytical dispersion relations, Eqs. (12) and (13), and analytical mode profiles, Eq. (8) and Fig. 2, are derived.\n- For weak stratifications, the kink frequencies and the frequency ratios are found\nup to the second order in \u03b5, Eqs. (15) and (16).\n- Increasing the density contrast decreases the frequencies but their ratios and\nshape of the profiles remain unchanged.\n- Models with variable total column mass, but constant footpoint densities, are\ninvestigated. Compared with models of constant total mass, the frequencies\nincrease more sharply with increasing \u03b5.\n- The case of negative scale heights is investigated and results are compared\nwith those of positive \u03b5's.\n- For 1.58 \u2264 \u03c92 /\u03c91 \u2264 1.82, and for typical loop lengths, 100-400 Mm, the density\nscale heights fall in the range of 20-210 Mm, in agreement with Andries et\nal. (2005a, b), Safari et al. (2007), McEwan et al. (2006), and Donnelly et\nal. (2006).\n- Based on our simple theoretical model and typical coronal conditions, the\nantinode shift of the first overtone mode profiles are in the range of 1.3\u221256.6\nMm. They are in the range of the detectability of the resolution of the\ncurrent observational instruments.\n\nReferences\nAndries, J.; Goossens, M.; Hollweg, J.
