They are also used for the construction\nof Collatz Series which exhibit prescribed regular graphics patterns. Finally,\nthe bearing of the present work on the question of non-trivial cycles is\ndiscussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Collatz Conjecture has been widely discussed in the mathematical literature and numerous authors have contributed to the discussion. Interesting\nreviews of the problem have been given by Lagarias (1996) and by Wirsching\n(2000).\nFor this paper a three-fold goal has been set.\nFirst, to present, within a newly developped concept, some new results\nwhich hopefully will help to deepen the understanding of the Collatz Conjecture and advance future research.\nSecond, to use key notions which appeal directly to the intuition of the\nnon-mathematician, rather than to the specialist in number theory. Thus\nwe will employ common language terms instead of scientific terms wherever\nthere is no risk of loss of precision. E.g. instead of describing an integer n\n\n1\n\n\fby the condition n \u2261 1 (mod 2) we will write 'n is odd'. To a large extent,\nscientific thinking depends on intuition and not every brain has been trained\nto think in terms of abstract formalisms.\nThird, to emphasize some facts about Collatz Series which have not been\naccorded sufficient attention in the previous literature.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notions of\nscenarios, their periods, phases, and their realizations. Section 3 explains\nthe notion of hooks and gives closed form expressions for their periods and\nphases. Section 4 lays the ground for the practical calculation of periods\nand phases for a given scenario. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are concerned with an\nimportant aspect of Collatz Backward Series. Section 5.3 gives an example\nfor the degree of control over Collatz Series which is reached with the results\nof this paper. With the exception of the outline of a proof for propositions\n2.2 and 2.3 and of the proofs for propositions 3.1, 5.1, and 5.2, no proof\nfor any of the other propositions is given. The proofs were omitted to keep\nthe length of the paper within reasonable bounds. They may be published\nelsewhere.\nTo facilitate reading the text, the ends of definitions and propositions are\nmarked by the symbol 2.\nLet us start by recalling or defining some of the basic terms and notions\nrelevant for the discussion.\nDefinition 1.1 The term Collatz Series designates the sequence of integers\nwhich is generated by recursive application of the Collatz Rules to a given\npositive integer m:\nDetermine 3m + 1 if m is odd, and determine m/2 if m is even.\nThe operation 3m + 1 will be denoted by 'u' (for 'up'), and\nthe operation m/2 will be denoted by 'd' (for 'down'). 2\nThe result of an 'u' operation, 3m + 1, is always an even integer and will,\ntherefore, undergo at least one operation 'd'.\nA few more remarks about Collatz-related jargon may be useful.\nWe will not only have to deal with Collatz Series, but also with the series generated by the inverse of the Collatz operations, i.e. the operations\n(m \u2212 1)/3 and 2m. Such a series will be called a Collatz Backward Series\nor, shorter, a 'CBS'. The ordinary Collatz Series will also be referred to as\na 'CFS' (Collatz Forward Series).\nSince the Collatz operations are involving the integers 2 and 3, divisibility by 2 or 3 will be an important property of the integers encountered.\nCommon language does already describe the divisibility by 2 in assigning\nthe properties even or odd to an integer. It will be useful as well to establish\nconvenient expressions to describe divisibility by 3.\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1.2 An integer n will be called\nRC0 if n/3 has remainder 0 (\u21d4 n \u2261 0 (mod3)),\nRC1 if n/3 has remainder 1 (\u21d4 n \u2261 1 (mod3)),\nRC2 if n/3 has remainder 2 (\u21d4 n \u2261 2 (mod3)).\nRC stands for the mathematical term Residue Class. 2\nE.g. we will say '6 is RC0', or '7 is RC1', or '8 is RC2'.\nHere are some simple algebraic properties of these classes which we will\nneed.\n(a) 2n is RC0 iff n is RC0, 2n is RC1 iff n is RC2, 2n is RC2 iff n is RC1.\n(b) RC0 + RC1 = RC1, RC0 - RC1 = RC2.\nWith this in mind we can now say that an 'up' operation will always\nresult in an even integer which is RC1. The ensuing 'down' operation will\nthen yield an integer which is RC2. Further division by 2, if it is possible,\nwill result in an integer which is RC1, and so on.\nFor this reason an integer which is RC0 cannot occur in a Collatz Series\nonce an 'up' operation has been made. An odd RC0 integer can occur at\nmost once in a Collatz Series.\nOdd RC0 integers are thus singled out among the other integers in a\nCollatz Series.\nAlso, since an odd RC0 integer can only be reached (from even RC0\nintegers) by 'down' operations, the backward extension of a Collatz Series\nfrom there is unique. This means that an odd RC0 integer determines a\nCollatz Series uniquely, both in forward and in backward direction.\nWe have to recall here that starting with an RC1 or RC2 integer, the\nCollatz Backward Series (CBS) is not unique, i.e. for each such integer\nthere is a backward tree with an infinte number of branches. However, there\nis only one way to go backwards from a RC0 integer, namely by repeated\ndoubling.\nIn view of the above it is appropriate to give the odd RC0 integers a\nproper name.\nDefinition 1.3 An integer which is odd and RC0 (i.e. divisible by 3 with\nremainder 0) will be called a handle. 2\nThe term handle was chosen since both the Collatz forward series (CFS)\nand the Collatz backward series (CBS) are determined uniquely by such an\ninteger. They are essential for the notion of the Complete Collatz Series.\nIt comes down from infinity through divisions by 2, with RC0 integers of\nthe form 2n H (H = 3M , M an arbitrary odd integer), until it reaches the\nhandle H. From thereon the series is made up of integers RC1 or RC2.\nWe shall show later (Section 5.1) that every odd integer can be reached\nin less than 8 steps by a Collatz Series starting from a handle.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nScenarios and their Realization.\n\nSince an operation 'u' is always followed by an operation 'd', the combined\noperation 'ud' will be denoted by 's' (for spike, the graphical appearance of\nthe operation).\nIt is clear that any Collatz Series can be described in terms of 'spikes'\nand 'downs'.\nDefinition 2.1 A sequence of Collatz operations connecting 2 odd integers\nwill be called a scenario. 2\nA scenario is thus described by a word, beginning with 's' and followed by\nany combination of the characters 's' or 'd'.\nDefinition 2.2 A series of integers which is described by a specified scenario\nwill be called a realization of the scenario. 2\nAs any scenario starts with an 's', the realization of a scenario starts with\nan odd integer.\nA scenario literally spells out what happens between a startnumber M\nand an endnumber N .\nFor a scenario with \u03c3 operations 's' and \u03b4 operations 'd' the general form\nis\n\nsd\u03b41 sd\u03b42 ...sd\u03b4\u03b1 ...sd\u03b4\u03c3\nwhere \u03b41 + \u03b42 +...+ \u03b4\u03c3 = \u03b4. The exponents \u03b4\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2, ...\u03c3) are describing\nthe multiplicity of the respective operation 'd'.\nWe are now arriving at a crucial point in our discussion. The simplest,\nalmost trivial question about Collatz Series is to ask, 'Given a startnumber, what is the series?' This question is, of course, the same as asking\n'Given a startnumber, what is the scenario attached to it?' Many authors of\narticles about the Collatz Conjecture have posed and answered this question.\nHere we will turn it around and ask the simple, but non-trivial question\n'Given a scenario, what are the startnumbers?'\nOur task will be to find the startnumbers which are compatible with a\ngiven scenario. In fact, we want to determine all realizations of a scenario.\n\nProposition 2.1 (Periodicity of a Realization) A scenario S uniquely\ndetermines\n- a pair of integers AM and BM , with AM even, BM odd,\n- a pair of integers AN and BN , with AN even, BN odd,\nsuch that for any k = 1, 2, 3, ......\nMk = AM * k \u2212 BM is the startnumber, and\nNk = AN * k \u2212 BN is the endnumber\n4\n\n\fof the Collatz sequence described by the scenario. 2\nCorollary 2.1 The RC-property of the startnumber Mk and the endnumber Nk is not changed under the replacement k k + 3p where p is any\n(positive) integer.2\n\n\u0019\n\nDefinition 2.3 The Collatz Series starting with Mk and ending with Nk\nwill be referred to as the kth realization of the scenario. The integer AM\n(AN ) will be called the startperiod (endperiod). The integer BM (BN ) will\nbe called the startphase (endphase). 2\nProposition 2.2 (Startperiod) Let \u03c3 and \u03b4 denote, respectively, the\nnumbers of spikes ('s') and downs ('d') in a scenario. The startperiod\ndepends on the total number of operations 's' and 'd' and is given by\nAM = 2 * 2\u03c3+\u03b4 . 2\nProposition 2.3 (Endperiod) The endperiod depends only on the number of spikes in the scenario and is given by AN = 2 * 3\u03c3 . 2\nOutline of a proof. Consider the simplest and most basic scenario which\nis just 's'. Apply the operation (3M +1)/2 to an unspecified odd startnumber\nM = 2k \u2212 1, where k may be any positive integer. The result is 3k \u2212 1 which\nis even or odd depending on k. To get an odd endnumber, re-scale k to 2k.\nThis yields Nk = 6k \u2212 1. To get the correct values of the startnumber, M\nhas to be re-scaled accordingly and then becomes Mk = 4k \u2212 1. To verify\nthat these expressions are realizations of the scenario 's' for all integers k,\njust apply the Collatz rules to Mk . \u0004\nBy similar reasoning one can derive the realizations for the next simplest\nscenarios, with k = 1, 2, 3...,\n'sd' : Startnumbers are Mk = 8k \u2212 7, endnumbers are Nk = 6k \u2212 5,\n'ss' : Startnumbers are Mk = 8k \u2212 1, endnumbers are Nk = 18k \u2212 1.\nAgain, these expressions may be verified by applying the Collatz rules to\nthe startnumbers.\nUnlike the periods, the phases are not given by simple expressions. The\nreason is that they depend on other properties of a scenario, such as the\norder in which the 's' and 'd' appear. However, the following can be said.\nProposition 2.4 Both startphase and endphase are odd integers.\nThe startphases satisfy the condition 0 <BM <AM .\nThe endphases satisfy the conditions 0 <BN <AN and, in addition, they\nare RC1 or RC2 (and not RC0). 2\nFurther remarks about endphases will be found in section 4. These con5\n\n\fditions are sufficient to assure that, in all realizations of the scenario, startnumbers and endnumbers are odd integers and, in addition, that the endnumbers are not divisible by 3.\n\n3\n\nHooks.\n\nWe will now take a look at the building blocks of any Collatz Series.\nDefinition 3.1 A \u03b4-hook is a scenario of the type sd\u03b4 . The exponential\nnotation indicates that the 'down' operation is performed \u03b4 times. 2\nHooks got their name from the way they appear in graphics. Since all\nscenarios are sequences of hooks hooked up to other hooks, this notion is\nbasic for the discussion of the Collatz conjecture.\nPeriod and phase for startnumber and endnumber of a hook are relatively easy to calculate. It turns out that the periods don't, but the phases\ndo depend on the parity of \u03b4.\nProposition 3.1 For a \u03b4-hook the following holds.\nPeriods: Startperiod: AM = 2\u03b4+2 , Endperiod: AN = 6,\nin accordance with propositions 2.2 and 2.3.\nPhases:\n\u03b4 even: Startphase: BM = (2\u03b4+1 + 1)/3 ,\nEndphase: BN = 1.\n\u03b4 odd: Startphase: BM = (5 * 2\u03b4+1 + 1)/3 , Endphase: BN = 5. 2\nProof. The startnumbers Mk and endnumbers Nk of a \u03b4-hook are given\nby\n\u03b4 even: Mk = 2\u03b4+2 * k \u2212 (2\u03b4+1 + 1)/3 ,\nNk = 6k \u2212 1\n\u03b4 odd: Mk = 2\u03b4+2 * k \u2212 (5 * 2\u03b4+1 + 1)/3 , Nk = 6k \u2212 5\nwith k = 1, 2, 3, ...\nUsing these expressions we obtain by straightforward calculation\n\u03b4 even: (3Mk + 1)/2 = 2\u03b4 (6k \u2212 1),\n\u03b4 odd: (3Mk + 1)/2 = 2\u03b4 (6k \u2212 5). \u0004\nIt should be noted that the endphase of a hook with \u03b4 even (odd) is RC1\n(RC2). Therefore, since the endperiod of a hook is always 6, the endnumber\nof a hook with \u03b4 even (odd) is RC2 (RC1).\nIn view of the relevance of the parity of \u03b4 we shall call a hook with \u03b4 even\n(odd) an even (odd) hook. Since the endnumber of any scenario and the last\nhook in it have the same RC-property, we have\nProposition 3.2 The endnumber of a scenario is RC2 (RC1) if the last\nhook is even (odd). 2\n\n6\n\n\fThis simple fact is also evident from basics since the last (in fact, any)\n's' operation in a scenario sets the RC-property of the integer reached to 2.\nValues for the periods and phases of the first 16 hooks are given in the\ntable below.\n\n\u03b4\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nStartperiod\n4\n8\n16\n32\n64\n128\n256\n512\n1.024\n2.048\n4.096\n8.192\n16.384\n32.768\n65.536\n131.072\n\nStartphase\n1\n7\n3\n27\n11\n107\n43\n427\n171\n1.707\n683\n6.827\n2.731\n27.307\n10.923\n109.227\n\nEndperiod\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n\nEndphase\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n1\n5\n\nThe first 16 hooks with their periods and phases.\nFigure 1 shows the graphics for various combinations of \u03b4-hooks with\n\u03b4 = 0, 1, 2. Each hook is pictured as the straight line connecting the startnumber with the endnumber. Since the intermediate even integers are not\nshown, the 'hook appearence' gets lost. Each column shows a number of\nrealizations for the type of hook indicated below the horizontal axis. You\nhave to imagine that each of these columns reaches upwards towards infinity! The number of realizations shown in the Figure is only limited by the\nspace available on paper.\nThe graphics shows how different hooks will connect to form new scenarios.\n1. The scenario 'ssd' which is made up of hooks from the first two columns,\nis shown with its first 10 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers\nMk = 16k \u2212 5 and endnumbers Nk = 18k \u2212 5.\n2. The scenario 'sdsdd' which is made up of hooks from the second and\nthird column, is shown with its first 4 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers Mk = 64k \u2212 47 and endnumbers Nk = 18k \u2212 13.\n3. The scenario 'sdds' which is made up of hooks from the third and fourth\n\n7\n\n\fcolumn, is shown with its first 5 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers Mk = 32k \u2212 3 and endnumbers Nk = 18k \u2212 1.\n4. The scenario 'ssdd' which is made up of hooks from the fourth and fifth\ncolumn, is shown with its first 2 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers Mk = 32k \u2212 13 and endnumbers Nk = 18k \u2212 7.\n5. The scenario 'ssdsdd' which is made up of hooks from the first three\ncolumns, is shown with its first 2 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers Mk = 128k \u2212 117 and endnumbers Nk = 54k \u2212 49.\n6. The scenario 'sdsdds' which is made up of hooks from columns 2 through\n4, is shown with its first 2 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers\nMk = 128k \u2212 47 and endnumbers Nk = 54k \u2212 19.\n7. The scenario 'ssdsdds' which is made up of hooks from columns 1 through\n4, is shown with its first 2 realizations. This scenario has startnumbers\nMk = 256k \u2212 117 and endnumbers Nk = 162k \u2212 73.\nThe trivial cycle is represented by the hook 'sd' in first realization. It is\nshown by the horizontal line at the bottom of the second column. Now, if\nthere would be a non-trivial cycle it would be shown in a similar diagram,\nwith many more hooks of various kind arranged in various order, and it\nwould have a startnumber to the left at the same hight as the endnumber\nto the right.\n\n4\n\nCalculation of Periods and Phases by Iteration.\n\nHere we will describe how the periods and phases are changed when one\noperation is appended to a scenario.\nAppending an 's' is easy because this operation is acting directly on the\nodd endnumber of the given scenario.\nAdding a 'd' is a bit more tricky since this operation does not act on the\nendnumber of the given scenario.\nBut in any case we start from a scenario S with realizations\nMk = AM * k \u2212 BM and Nk = AN * k \u2212 BN , where k = 1, 2, 3, ...\nThe enlarged scenario S \u2032 has realizations with\n\u2032 and endnumbers N \u2032 = A\u2032 * k \u2212 B \u2032 , where\nstartnumbers Mk\u2032 = A\u2032M * k \u2212 BM\nk\nN\nN\nk = 1, 2, 3, ...\nProposition 4.1 (Appending an 's') Let S \u2032 = Ss be the scenario with\none operation 's' added at the end of S.\nThe periods and phases of S \u2032 are expressed by those of S as follows.\n\n1\u20442(3B\nA\u2032M\n\nN\n\n\u2212 1) odd:\n\n\u2032 =B\n= 2AM , BM\nM ,\n\n8\n\n\f1\u20442\n\n\u2032 = (3B \u2212 1).\nA\u2032N = 3AN , BN\nN\n\n1\u20442(3B\nA\u2032M\nA\u2032N\n\nN\n\n\u2212 1) even:\n\n\u2032 =B +A\n= 2AM , BM\nM\nM ,\n\u2032 = (3B + 3A \u2212 1). 2\n= 3AN , BN\nN\nN\n\n1\u20442\n\n1\u20442\n\nIt is worth noting that in the case where (3BN \u2212 1) is odd, the startphase\nremains unchanged. Simple reasoning shows that this is true for any BN\nwhich can be written as BN = 4j \u2212 3, with any j that is RC1 or RC2 (not\nRC0!).\nLikewise, in the case where (3BN \u22121) is even, the new startphase is obtained\nby simply adding the startperiod to the startphase of the given scenario. The\ncondition is satisfied by any BN which can be written as BN = 4j \u2212 1, with\nany j that is RC0 or RC2 (not RC1!).\nThe restrictions on j are necessary to ensure that BN , and by implication\nNk = AN k \u2212 BN , is not a handle.\n\n1\u20442\n\nProposition 4.2 (Appending a 'd') Let S \u2032 = Sd be the scenario with\none operation 'd' added at the end of S.\nThe periods and phases of S \u2032 are expressed by those of S as follows.\n\n1\u20442(B + 1\u20442A\n\nN)\n\nN\n\nA\u2032M\nA\u2032N\n\n1\u20442\n1\u20442\n\n\u2032 =B + A\n= 2AM , BM\nM\nM ,\n\u2032\n= AN , BN = (BN + AN ) .\n\n1\u20442(B +1\u20442A\nN\n\nA\u2032M\nA\u2032N\n\nodd:\n\nN)\n\n1\u20442\n\neven:\n\n\u2032 = [B\n= 2AM , BM\nM + 3AM /2] mod AM ,\n\u2032\n= AN , BN = [ (BN + 3AN /2)] mod AN . 2\n\n1\u20442\n\nThe above formulas may be used (and have been used by the author)\nto write a program which calculates all periods and phases as well as the\nstartnumber and endnumber for the kth realization of any given scenario,\nsee next section.\n\n5\n\nApplications and Examples.\n\nGiven that handles are playing such a unique role in Collatz Series it is interesting to ask how far they are away from ordinary integers, i.e. integers\nwhich are even or odd, RC1 or RC2. By 'how far away' we mean the number of steps (up or down) by which the integer can be reached via a Collatz\nSeries.\nFor reasons which will become clear in the following it turns out to be ad9\n\n\fvantageous to consider separately odd and even target integers.\n5.1 Hooking up odd Integers to Handles.\nProposition 5.1 Any odd integer is located on a Collatz Series within\nless than 8 steps from a handle. (One step is either an 'up' or a 'down'\noperation.) 2\nProof. If the integer in question is odd and RC0, nothing has to be shown\nbecause it is itself a handle. We will show that hooks with \u03b4 < 6 can provide\nthe link between handles and any odd (none RC0) integer. These hooks are\nlisted in the first column of the table below, followed by the number of (up\nor down) steps in the second column. In the fifth column we have entered\nthe smallest values of k for which the corresponding startnumber Mk is a\nhandle. These startnumbers are listed in the sixth column (headed 'M ').\nThe last column shows the corresponding endnumbers.\nHook\ns\nsd\nsd2\nsd3\nsd4\nsd5\n\nSteps\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nStartnumber Mk\n4k \u2212 1\n8k \u2212 7\n16k \u2212 3\n32k \u2212 27\n64k \u2212 11\n128k \u2212 107\n\nEndnumber Nk\n6k \u2212 1\n6k \u2212 5\n6k \u2212 1\n6k \u2212 5\n6k \u2212 1\n6k \u2212 5\n\nk\n1\n2\n3\n3\n2\n1\n\nM\n3\n9\n45\n69\n117\n21\n\nN\n5\n7\n17\n13\n11\n1\n\nThe endnumbers (last column) comprise all odd non-RC0 integers which\nare in the interval (0, 18). It can be verified by direct calculation that for\neach scenario the target is reached.\nNow replace k (in col. 5, table above) by k + 3p where p is any positive\ninteger. The startnumbers will become larger, but they will remain handles.\nThe endnumbers will just be increased by 18p.\nFor p = 0 the k-values, startnumbers, and endnumbers are shown in the\ntable above (col. 5, 6, 7).\nFor p = 1 the resulting k-values, startnumbers, and endnumbers are shown\nin the table below (columns 5, 6, 7) and for p = 2 they are shown in columns\n8, 9, 10.\nHook\ns\nsd\nsd2\nsd3\nsd4\nsd5\n\nk + 3p\n1 + 3p\n2 + 3p\n3 + 3p\n3 + 3p\n2 + 3p\n1 + 3p\n\nMp\n3 + 12p\n9 + 24p\n45 + 48p\n69 + 96p\n117 + 192p\n21 + 384p\n\nNp\n5 + 18p\n7 + 18p\n17 + 18p\n13 + 18p\n11 + 18p\n1 + 18p\n\n10\n\nk\n4\n5\n6\n6\n5\n4\n\nM\n15\n33\n93\n165\n309\n405\n\nN\n23\n25\n35\n31\n29\n19\n\nk\n7\n8\n9\n9\n8\n7\n\nM\n27\n57\n141\n261\n501\n789\n\nN\n41\n43\n53\n49\n47\n37\n\n\fIf we let p run through all natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, .... all odd non-RC0\nintegers will occur as endnumbers in one of the hooks which begins with a\nhandle. \u0004\nThe result does not mean, that a hook always provides the shortest way to\nconnect an odd integer to a handle. For instance, the integer 19 is reached,\nvia a hook, from the handle 405 in 7 steps as shown in the table above. But\nit is reached in 6 steps from the handle 33 (via the scenario sdsd).\n5.2 Hooking up even Integers to Handles.\nProposition 5.1 applies to all odd integers which are not handles, i.e. the integers beginning 1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,25,29,31,35,37,41,43,47,49,53, etc. Naturally, the question arises if a similar result holds for even integers.\nProposition 5.2 Any even integer (not RC0) is located on a Collatz Series\nwithin less than 7 steps from a handle. (One step is either an 'up' or a\n'down' operation.) 2\nProof. First of all it is clear that the doubles of the odd integers above will\nbe found within less than 7 steps from a handle. These are the integers\n2,10,14,22,26,34,38,46,50,58,62,70,74,82,86,94,98,106, etc.\nBut how about the even integers in between, beginnning with\n4,8,16,20,28,32,40,44,52,56,64,68,76,80,88,92,100,104, etc.?\nNote that the above series is made up of the 2 sub-series\n12j \u2212 8 and 12j \u2212 4 where j = 1, 2, 3....\nIt is easily verified that the integers in the first sub-series are hooked up to\nhandles in the following way (with p taking the values 1,2,3...).\nFor j = 3p the endnumber 36p \u2212 8 is obtained from the handle 12p \u2212 3 in\none step ('up').\nFor j = 3p \u2212 1 the endnumber 36p \u2212 20 is obtained from the handle 48p \u2212 27\nin three steps (by the 1-hook 'sd').\nFor j = 3p\u22122 the endnumber 36p\u221232 is obtained from the handle 192p\u2212171\nin five steps (by the 3-hook 'sddd').\nSimilarly, the integers in the second sub-series are hooked up to handles as\nfollows.\nFor j = 3p the endnumber 36p \u2212 4 is obtained from the handle 24p \u2212 3 in\ntwo steps (by the 0-hook 's').\nFor j = 3p \u2212 2 the endnumber 36p \u2212 28 is obtained from the handle 96p \u2212 75\nin four steps (by the 2-hook 'sdd').\nFor j = 3p\u22121 the endnumber 36p\u221216 is obtained from the handle 384j \u2212171\nin six steps (by the 4-hook 'sdddd').\u0004\nWhat is the significance of the result?\nIt shows that handles are lurking around the corner near all integers of a\nCollatz Series. And, in the unlikely case that a non-trivial cycle should exist,\nit would be surrounded by a halo of close-by handles. People who have dealt\n11\n\n\fwith Collatz Backward Series (CBS) may have noticed that non-trivial CBS\n(i.e. those which are not obtained by merely doubling RC1 or RC2 integers)\nwill sooner or later hit a handle. And, recalling that one in 3 integers is a\nhandle, one realizes how difficult it would be for the CBS on a cycle to miss\nall the handles that are in its way.\nBut, what really counts here is the way of treating the problem: The\nperiodicity of scenarios is used to transport some property about Collatz\nSeries from one finite interval (the period of a scenario) to all intervalls,\ni.e. to infinity. The method is like a 'mathematical telescope' allowing to\nmake statements about numbers which are so large that there would not be\nenough available paper on earth to write them down, not even in fine print!\n5.3 Collatz Series Sections without Hailstones.\nSome of the publications on the Collatz conjecture have invoked the notion\nof hailstones to describe the seemingly random order in which integers are\nappearing in a Collatz Series.\nTo exemplify the benefits which can be drawn from propositions 4.1 and 4.2\nwe want to produce a startnumber which leads to the section of a Collatz\nSeries that has a perfectly regular pattern. For example, let us look at the\nscenario S = (s7 d4 )9 . The exponents indicate the multiplicity of the respective operation. So, in this scenario we have in total 7 * 9 = 63 operations\n's' and 4 * 9 = 36 operations 'd'. In terms of the traditional up- and down\noperations these figures amont to 162 steps.\nBeginning with the scenario 's', with startnumbers Mk = 4k \u2212 1 and endnumbers Nk = 6k \u2212 1, we apply the results of the previous section 4 and\nperform the 98 remaining iterations to get the periods and phases of our\nscenario. The result is the following.\nStartperiod = 1267650600228229401496703205376\nStartphase = 1039655887956965120651972413057\nEndperiod = 2289122546861674989771899392854\nEndphase = 1877409858577201070748176480485.\nEach of these 4 integers has the order 1030 .\nThe first 3 realizations of the scenario are as follows.\n1st Realization:\nStartnumber = 227994712271264280844730792319,\nEndnumber = 411712688284473919023722912369.\nEach of these 2 integers is of the order 1029 .\n2nd Realization:\nStartnumber = 1495645312499493682341433997695,\nEndnumber = 2700835235146148908795622305223.\n3rd Realization:\n12\n\n\fStartnumber = 2763295912727723083838137203071,\nEndnumber = 4989957782007823898567521698077.\nEach of these 4 integers is of the order 1030 .\nUsing a suitable software for handling large integers and the iteration\nformulas of section 4, all of the above integers were calculated in just the\nfraction of a second.\nAll-Number graphics and Odd-Number graphics. When it comes to the\ngraphical representation of Collatz Series, we have to make the choice between two options. We may plot either all integers which are generated by\nup- or down operations, creating a AN graphics (AN stands for 'All Numbers'), or we may plot only the odd integers which occur in a CFS, creating\na ON graphics (ON stands for 'Odd Numbers'). The latter has the clear\nadvantage of displaying much less jitter than we would see in the AN graphics.\nFigure 2 pictures, as ON-graphics, the first 3 realizations of the scenario.\nThe curves show a nearly horizontal and slightly increasing regular zigzag\npattern with the endnumbers less than twice the corresponding startnumbers. Once the scenario is terminated, the habitual, chaotic looking shape\nof the series is back. Figure 3 shows, also as ON-graphics, the section of the\nCollatz Series presentating the first 3 realizations of the scenario. In Figure\n4, the scenario sections of the Collatz Series are shown in full detail, i.e.\nwith all numbers pictured (AN-graphics).\nPlease note also the difference in counting steps in ON-graphics and ANgraphics. In ON-graphics (Figures 2, 3) we just count the odd integers\n(whose number equals the number of 's' operations in any section of a Collatz Series). In AN-graphics (Figure 4) we count all integers, i.e. for a\nscenario with \u03c3 's'-operations and \u03b4 'd'-operations, the number of steps\ncounted is 2\u03c3 + \u03b4.\nThe result shows that the integers appearing in a Collatz Series are not\nalways falling like 'hailstones'. Rather they are what we want them to be,\nwithin the limits of what is allowed by the Collatz rules. We could construct\nCollatz Series with much longer scenarios than the one considered here, expressing any regular pattern. Most Collatz Series are looking like random\npatterns because the startnumbers were chosen at random!\nIn the above example, the scenario was derived from the requirement that,\nin first realization, the endnumber N of the subscenario s7 d4 should be close\nto the startnumber M , i.e. satisfy the condition \u03c1 =|(M \u2212 N )/N | \u226a 1.\nFor our scenario, (s7 d4 )9 , we have \u03c1 \u2243 0.45, but for the subscenario s7 d4 it\nholds \u03c1 \u2243 0.064.\n\n13\n\n\f6\n\nEpilogue and Outlook.\n\nEpilogue. After the present work on scenarios had been done, G. J.\nWirsching pointed out that it might be related to that of Riho Terras. The\npaper of Terras appeared 1976 in Acta Arithmetica and can be found via a\nlink at the web site http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/. Terras work (which is not\nquite easy to understand by somebody who is not specialized in mathematics) is indeed related to the present work. In the following, that relation\nwill be described, employing the terminology developped in this paper. The\nencoding vector defined by Terras is closely related, but logically not the\nsame as the scenario we defined here. Both notions have in common that\nthey characterize a sequence of Collatz operations. If you consider a scenario and replace in it each operation 's' by '1' and each operation 'd' by '0',\nyou get the corresponding encoding vector. (We remark in passing that the\nencoding vector is just a sequence of Boolean numbers, but does not really\nqualify as a vector since this term has a specific meaning in geometry). The\ndifference of the two notions lies in the situations they cover. The scenario\nis defined such that the corresponding Collatz sequence will start and end\nwith an odd integer. In contrast, the encoding vector corresponds to a Collatz sequence which may end in an even or an odd integer. For this reason,\nTerras finds for the period of his encoding representation (which is his startnumber) half the value of that which we have determined for the scenario.\nIn other words, there are twice as many (numerical) realizations for an encoding vector than for a scenario. Furthermore, since the endnumbers may\nbe even, the Terras encoding vectors cannot always be connected with each\nother. In contrast, scenarios can always be connected since they always end\nwith an odd integer. Nevertheless, the result of Terras (his Theorem 1.2)\nwhich he termed himself a remarkable periodicity phenomenon stands out\nas a singular achievement.\nOutlook. Where should future work go from here?\nThe first important goal should be to disprove the existence of non-trivial\ncycles. The trivial cycle (the first realization of the 1-hook 'sd', see Figure\n1) has only one odd integer in it. If a non-trivial cycle exists it would have\na great number (at least about 107 ) of odd integers in it. Every odd integer in a cycle could be taken as the start- and endnumber of a scenario.\nIf the number of odd integers is \u03c3, there would be \u03c3 scenarios to take into\nconsideration. All these scenarios would have the same startperiod and the\nsame endperiod. Their startphases would be different from each other and\nso would be their endphases. There would be \u03c3 equations to be satisfied,\nstating for each scenario the condition that startnumber and endnumber are\nthe same. If these equations would be incompatible, the question of nontrivial cycles would be settled.\n\n14\n\n\fAnother question of interest for the Collatz problem would be the composition (i.e. the concatenation) of scenarios. How to determine the phases\nof the scenario S = S1 S2 in terms of properties of the scenarios S1 and S2 ?\nAs to the periods there is no problem, since from propositions 2.2 and 2.3\nwe simply find the startperiod AM = A1M * A2M and the endperiod AN =\nA1N * A2N . However, a much harder nut to crack would be to express the\nphases of S by the periods and phases of S1 and S2 .\nAs a first step one should try to have a look at hooks. Since hooks are the\nbuilding blocks of scenarios it would be useful to have rules for their composition. First calculations on the composition of a j-hook and a k-hook indicate\nthat the result will depend, among other factors, on the RC-property of k.\n\n1\u20442\n\n1\u20442\n\nStill another interesting question would be about flat CBS. These are obtained by performing, each time an odd RC1 or RC2 integer is reached, only\nthe minimal number of doublings necessary to get an even RC1 integer.\nThat minimal number of doublings would be equal to one if the odd integer\nis RC2 and it would be equal two if the odd integer is RC1. Consider one\nfixed integer and the set of CBS going back from there. Among all CBS emanating from that integer, the flat CBS and the hooks are the two opposite\nextremes. While hooks represent the steepest increase in a CBS, flat CBS\nare the other extreme. Can an upper limit be posed on the number of steps\nnecessary to reach a handle via a flat CBS ?\nReferences.\nJ.C.
