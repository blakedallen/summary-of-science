Other astro-\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecent work to investigate the cosmic evolution\nof the fine structure constant (\u03b1 \u2261 e2 /~c) suggests\na decrement in the past: \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 = (\u22120.574 \u00b1\n0.102) \u00d7 10\u22125 for 0.2 \u2264 z \u2264 3.7, where \u2206\u03b1 \u2261\n\u03b1(t) \u2212 \u03b1\u25e6 (Murphy, Webb, & Flambaum 2003).\nThis result applies the \"many-multiplet\" method\nto optical absorption lines in the spectra of high\nredshift quasars; \u03b1 parameterizes the strength of\nelectromagnetic interactions and a changing \u03b1 will\ncause spectral line shifts from present-day values.\n1\n\n\fphysical constraints obtain results consistent with\nno change in the fine structure constant: O III\nemission line shifts in quasars with 0.16 < z <\n0.80 from the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey obtain\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (7 \u00b1 14) \u00d7 10\u22125 (Bahcall, Steinhardt,\n& Schlegel 2004); and comparisons of H I 21 cm\n(1420 MHz) line redshifts (\u03bd \u221d \u03b14 ) to molecular\nrotation transitions (\u03bd \u221d \u03b12 ) in molecular absorption systems obtain \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22120.10\u00b10.22)\u00d710\u22125\nat z = 0.2467 and \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22120.08 \u00b1 0.27) \u00d7 10\u22125\nat z = 0.6847 (Murphy et al. 2001).\nRadio observations of molecular and H I absorption lines show much promise for exceptionally precise measurements of the value of \u03b1 across\na large span of cosmic time. These lines are generally narrow and simple. Complex molecules and\nmolecules with unbalanced electron angular momentum, like OH and CH, offer multiple transitions with differing dependence on \u03b1, providing measurements of \u2206\u03b1 from a single species including quantitative estimates of systematic velocity offsets between species (Darling 2003). These\nsame molecules can also provide simultaneous constraints on the cosmic variation of \u03b1, gp , and\nme /mp (Chengalur & Kanekar 2003; Kanekar &\nChengalur 2004).\nFurther, OH can form a natural maser across a\nwide range of physical settings, and observed ratios of the four ground state 18 cm OH lines, at\n1612, 1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz, provide clues to\nthe physical conditions associated with the masing. A special case occurs when both emission\nand absorption are stimulated in pairs of conjugate OH lines, lines that are identical except for\nthe sign of the optical depth. Conjugate lines are\na direct result of quantum selection rules and an\noptically thick far-infrared transition from a single\ndominant excited rotation state (Elitzur 1992; van\nLangevelde et al. 1995). Conjugate lines can be\nadded to obtain a perfect null, indicating that the\nlines are produced in the same molecular gas complex. Hence, conjugate lines provide a valuable\nlaboratory for precision measurements of fundamental constants: lines are guaranteed to reside\nin the same physical location at the same physical velocity, so any relative line shift in a conjugate pair indicates a change in physical constants\nrather than systematic effects.\nThe primary difficulty with the molecular absorption line approach to changing constants is the\n\ndearth of molecular absorption systems. To our\nknowledge, only six cm- and mm-detected molecular absorbers at z & 0.1 are known, only four\nof these have z > 0.2, and the highest redshift\nsystem is PKS 1830 \u2212 211 at z = 0.8858 (Wiklind & Combes 1996; Chengalur, de Bruyn, &\nNarasimha 1999). Numerous groups are currently\nsearching for additional high redshift mm molecular absorption systems (e.g. Murphy, Curran, &\nWebb (2003)).\nThis letter presents new observations of the OH\n18 cm and HI 21 cm lines toward PKS 1413+135\nat z = 0.2467 that reveal conjugate OH satellite\nlines (\u00a72,3). The conjugate lines are guaranteed to\noriginate in the same gas complex (\u00a74) and provide\na new laboratory for a measurement of the fine\nstructure constant at z = 0.2467 (\u00a75). The OH\nlines also provide quantitative estimates of the systematic velocity offsets between species (such as\nOH, HI, and CO), demonstrating that seemingly\nsignificant nonzero \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 measurements are in\nfact consistent with zero once systematic effects\nhave been removed.\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed the molecular absorption system at z = 0.2467 toward the radio source PKS\n1413+135 at the NRAO Green Bank Telescope1\non December 14, 17, and 19, 2003, simultaneously observing the four 2 \u03a03/2 J = 3/2 OH\nlines at 1612.23101, 1665.40184, 1667.35903, and\n1720.52998 MHz and the H I line at 1420.405751786\nMHz, each appropriately redshifted and tracked in\na barycentric reference frame. We observed four\n12.5 MHz bandpasses centered on the 1420, 1612,\n1667, and 1720 MHz lines in two linear polarizations in a 5 minute position-switched mode with\na winking calibration diode and data recorded every 0.5 seconds. Bandpasses were divided into\n8192 channels, but the nature of the autocorrelation spectrometer reduced the effective spectral\nresolution to 3.05 kHz or 0.80 km s\u22121 for H I at\nz = 0.2467. Fast sampling was intended to facilitate radio frequency interference (RFI) excision,\nbut the observed bands were generally clean in\nthe vicinity of the observed lines. The OH 1720\n1 The\n\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of\nthe National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n2\n\n\fin absorption at 7.9 mJy. The 1665 MHz line is\nnot detected at a similar limit to the 1667 MHz\nline (Table 1). Gaussian fits to the detected lines\nare listed in Table 1; the OH lines are well fit\nby single gaussian profiles, but the H I profile requires 4 components. The broad H I 4 component\nmay be an artifact associated with the RFI above\n\u223c 80 km s\u22121 . To within the quoted uncertainties\nin the gaussian fits, the two OH line profiles are\nindistinguishable in redshift, width, and |\u03c4 |.\nAlthough there is evidence for a nonzero spectral index across the observed bands, optical\ndepths are computed assuming a constant flux\ndensity of 1.2 Jy at 1100\u20131400 MHz for PKS\n1413+135. This assumption is broadly consistent with the observations at the 10% uncertainty\nlevel and simplifies comparisons with previous observations. The core-jet radio continuum of PKS\n1413+135 is extended on scales of 60 milliarcseconds (215 pc) and the H I absorption is certainly\nassociated with the jet, although it may extend\nacross the core as well (Carilli et al. 2000; Perlman et al. 2002). Optical depths are thus likely to\nbe lower bounds because the continuum covering\nfactor is unknown.\nDespite the uniform assumptions about the\nsource continuum level, we observe a significantly\ndeeper H I absorption (\u03c4c = 0.757 \u00b1 0.002, statistical error only) than Carilli, Perlman, & Stocke\n(1992) who obtained a peak optical depth of 0.34\u00b1\n0.04. Given the incomplete covering of the continuum source, our result is compatible with \u03c4 = 0.89\nobtained from VLBI observations by Carilli et al.\n(2000). Note that the quoted errors in the H I\nprofile fits are very conservative and take into account the blended line profile; fitting with fewer\ncomponents would give a lower uncertainty in the\nline position but a larger residual to the fit. Note\nalso that a single component gaussian fit to the\nH I asymmetric profile produces an offset from the\npeak optical depth.\n\nMHz line did show some nearby RFI, but careful\ninspection and flagging eliminated any possible\ndisruption or contamination of the line profile.\nRecords were individually calibrated and bandpasses flattened using the winking calibration\ndiode and the corresponding off-source records.\nRecords and polarizations were subsequently averaged to obtain a final spectrum. Spectra were\nHanning smoothed, and a linear or quadratic baseline was fit and subtracted from a narrow spectral\nwindow centered on each line (including the 1665\nMHz line). The total on-source integration time\nwas 90 minutes for the OH lines and 120 minutes\nfor the H I line. We reached a typical rms noise of\n1.8 mJy in 3.05 kHz channels. All data reduction\nwas performed in AIPS++2 .\nOur single dish flux density measurements of\nPKS 1413+135 are consistent with previous observations. At 1140 MHz, the observed flux density\nis 1.367 Jy, consistent with the Carilli, Perlman, &\nStocke (1992) measurement of 1.25 \u00b1 0.15 Jy. At\n1380 MHz, we obtain 1.085 Jy and Condon et al.\n(1998) measured 1.092 \u00b1 33 Jy. At 1293 and 1337\nMHz, we obtain 1.162 and 1.192 Jy respectively.\nFlux calibration of these data seems to be reliable, but can be systematically affected by in- and\nout-of-band RFI, especially in the 1140 MHz band\nwhich contains abundant strong RFI. Systematic\nflux calibration errors in these data appear to be\nwell below 10%.\n3.\n\nResults\n\nOf the five lines observed toward PKS 1413+135,\nonly three were detected: the 1612 and 1720 MHz\nlines of OH and the 21 cm line of H I (Figure\n1). The H I and 1612 MHz lines were detected\nin absorption. The 1720 MHz line has a profile\nsimilar to the 1612 MHz line profile modulo the\nspectral noise, but with a negative optical depth.\nThe 1667 MHz line is not detected, contrary to\nthe detection by Kanekar & Chengalur (2002).\nWe obtain an rms noise value of 1.1 mJy in boxcar smoothed spectra with 4.0 km s\u22121 resolution\nsimilar to the resolution obtained by Kanekar &\nChengalur (2002), who detect the 1667 MHz line\n\n4.\n\nConjugate OH Lines\n\nThe optical depths in the 18 cm OH satellite lines are of order \u00b10.01 while the main lines\nare suppressed by an order of magnitude, below \u03c4 \u223c 0.001. The observed conjugate satellite\nlines and the suppressed main lines are consistent with a scenario of radiatively pumped stimu-\n\n2 The\n\nAIPS++ (Astronomical Information Processing System) is freely available for use under the Gnu Public License.

As explained by\nElitzur (1992) and van Langevelde et al. (1995) the\n18 cm transitions compete for the same IR pumping photons. Since the population of the ground\nstates is governed by the selection rule \u2206F = \u00b11, 0\n(and a change in parity) and if the radiative decay to the ground state is optically thick, then the\nF = 2, 3 states of the J = 5/2 level overpopulate\nthe F = 2 states compared to the F = 1 states of\nthe ground J = 3/2 level (\u2206F = \u00b12 is forbidden).\nThe main OH lines follow the rule \u2206F = 0 while\nthe satellite lines have \u2206F = \u00b11. Since 1720 MHz\nemission follows F = 2+ \u2192 1\u2212 , it is seen in emission. The 1612 MHz line appears as stimulated\nabsorption via F = 2\u2212 \u2192 1+ . The conjugate behavior of the satellite lines maintains equal populations in the two F = 1 and equal populations\nin the two F = 2 states, suppressing nonthermal\n\u2206F = 0 main line (1665 and 1667 MHz) emission\nor absorption.\nExtragalactic conjugate OH satellite lines have\nbeen observed toward NGC 4945 (Whiteoak &\nGardner 1975), Cen A (van Langevelde et al.\n1995), M82 (Seaquist, Frayer, & Frail 1997), and\nNGC 253 (Frayer, Seaquist, & Frail 1998). In\nsome cases, like NGC 253, the OH satellite lines\nare conjugate over a wide range of conditions and\nshow cross-over from absorption to emission (and\nvice-versa). The 1612 MHz line changes to emission when the radiative pumping becomes dominated by the cross-ladder 79 \u03bcm transition from\nthe 2 \u03a01/2 J = 1/2 state (van Langevelde et al.\n1995).\nThe scenario proposed for PKS 1413+135 is\nvalid for an optically thick 119 \u03bcm intraladder\ntransition but requires an optically thin 79 \u03bcm\ncross-ladder transition. Since the intraladder and\ncross-ladder Einstein coefficients differ by nearly\nan order of magnitude, there is an order of magnitude range in the OH column density 1014 cm\u22122\nkm\u22121 s . NOH /\u2206V . 1015 cm\u22122 km\u22121 s for conjugate behavior with 1720 MHz in emission (van\nLangevelde et al. 1995). For \u2206V \u2248 10 km s\u22121 ,\nNOH \u2248 1015 \u20131016 cm\u22122 . Assuming an OH abundance of NOH \u223c 10\u22127 NH2 , we obtain an order\nof magnitude estimate of the molecular hydrogen\ncolumn of NH2 \u2248 1022 \u20131023 cm\u22122 . This is signifi-\n\ncantly different from CO estimates by Wiklind &\nCombes (1997) of NH2 \u2265 4\u00d71020 cm\u22122 which they\nstress may be a severe underestimate for a dense\nclumpy medium. The CO may also be in a different physical region than the OH (\u00a75). Note that\nthe usual direct determination of the OH column\nfrom the integrated optical depth (Liszt & Lucas\n1996) is inappropriate for this case of stimulated\ntransitions.\n5.\n\nMeasuring the Fine Structure Constant\n\nOH lines can provide precise constraints on cosmic evolution of the physical constants \u03b1, the proton g-factor, and the ratio of electron to proton\nmass (Darling 2003; Chengalur & Kanekar 2003;\nKanekar & Chengalur 2004). The following treatment assumes that \u03b1 evolution provides the dominant contribution to any changes in line rest frequencies. Since only the satellite 18 cm OH lines\nhave been detected in PKS 1413+135, we provide\nsupplemental equations to Darling (2003) which\nfocused on the main OH lines.\nThe 18 cm OH lines can be decomposed into a\n\u039b-doubled term which depends weakly on \u03b1 and\na hyperfine term which has the usual strong \u03b14\ndependence (Darling 2003). From these, sums and\ndifferences of lines can form pure \u039b-doubled and\npure hyperfine quantities:\n\u03a3\u03bd\n\u2206\u03bd\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\n\u03bd1720 + \u03bd1612 = 2\u039b\u03b10.4\n(1)\n+\n\u2212\n4\n\u03bd1720 \u2212 \u03bd1612 = 2(\u2206 + \u2206 )\u03b1 (2)\n\nwhere \u2206+ = 9.720353(25) \u00d7 109 MHz and \u2206\u2212 =\n9.375256(25) \u00d7 109 MHz set the strength of hyperfine splitting, \u039b = 11926.36309(51) MHz sets the\nstrength of the \u039b-doubling, and the exponents on\n\u03b1 are accurate to \u2264 5% (Darling 2003). Redshift\ndifferences between pairs of OH lines can be tied\ndirectly to changes in \u03b1, mitigating systematic effects by comparing highly correlated lines from a\nsingle species:\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a3\u03bd \u2206\u03bd\n\u2206\u03b1\nz1612 \u2212 z1720\n\u2243 1.8\n(3)\n1 + z1720\n\u03b1\u25e6\n\u03bd1720 \u03bd1612 \u25e6\nThe conjugate OH lines in PKS 1413+135 provide\nan ideal laboratory for \u03b1 measurements because\nthe lines are guaranteed to arise from the same\nmolecular gas. From the OH lines alone, we obtain\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 = (0.5 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10\u22125 , consistent with no\n4\n\n\fchange in \u03b1 (Table 2). The precision of this OHonly measurement could be significantly improved\nby comparing the 18 cm OH transitions to higher\nfrequency OH transitions at 4 and 6 GHz.\nThe OH redshifts can be compared to molecular line or H I redshifts for additional independent measurements of \u03b1, and one can employ the\npure \u039b-doubled and pure hyperfine OH quantities\nto constrain systematic velocity offsets and measurement errors between species. In particular,\nzHI \u2212 z\u2206\u03bd = 0 in the absence of systematic offsets between species. Any nonzero value obtained\nfrom this expression thus quantifies the systematic errors in other H I-OH determinations of \u03b1.\nTable 2 lists and Figure 2 plots apparent \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6\nvalues from pairs of OH, H I, and CO lines (note\nthat from four lines, there are only three independent values). These values are computed from OH\nsatellite line analogues to the main line expressions\npresented in Darling (2003):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\u03b1\n\u03a3\u03bd\nzHI \u2212 z1612\n\u2243 \u22121.8\n(4)\n1 + z1612\n\u03b1\u25e6 \u03bd1612 \u25e6\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\u03b1\n\u03a3\u03bd\nzHI \u2212 z1720\n\u2243 \u22121.8\n(5)\n1 + z1720\n\u03b1\u25e6 \u03bd1720 \u25e6\n\u0012\n\u0013\nzCO \u2212 z1612\n\u2206\u03b1 0.8 \u03a3\u03bd + \u2206\u03bd\n\u2243 \u2212\n(6)\n1 + z1612\n\u03b1\u25e6\n\u03bd1612\n\u0012\n\u0013\u25e6\nzCO \u2212 z1720\n\u2206\u03b1 0.8 \u03a3\u03bd \u2212 \u2206\u03bd\n\u2243 \u2212\n(7)\n1 + z1720\n\u03b1\u25e6\n\u03bd1720\n\u25e6\n\nwhich is 18.7 \u00b1 13.9 km s\u22121 in the rest frame of\nPKS 1413+135. This quantity, translated into a\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 offset of (+1.73 \u00b1 1.29) \u00d7 10\u22125, shows that\nthe systematic offsets, while uncertain in magnitude, can account for all of the apparent change\nin \u03b1 in OH-H I line pairs. A similar argument\napplies to the OH-CO line pairs, but since OH\nlines cannot form a quantity which depends on\n\u03b12 , the \u03a3\u03bd-CO and \u2206\u03bd-CO quantities bracket the\ntrue value of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 and should produce consistent values in the absence of systematic effects.\nSince they are not consistent in PKS 1413+135,\nwe can solve for the systematic velocity offsets between OH and CO (see Appendix A). We obtain\n\u2206zsys (OH \u2212 CO) = (6.95 \u00b1 2.57) \u00d7 10\u22125, which is\n16.7\u00b16.2 km s\u22121 in the rest frame. Hence, the OHCO systematic offsets can account for the apparent\nchange in \u03b1 in OH-CO line pairs as well. The interspecies systematic corrections have been applied\nto the appropriate line pairs and are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Figure 2. Finally, the H I-CO\npair indicates a 2.9\u03c3 deviation from \u2206\u03b1 = 0 that\nthe OH observations suggest could be completely\nattributed to systematic effects, as suggested by\nCarilli et al. (2000).\nIs is no coincidence that all corrected points in\nFigure 2 have the same value and nearly the same\nuncertainties. The correction for systematic offsets between species relies on the measurement of\n\u2206\u03bd to quantify the systematics, but this difference\nin frequencies is precisely the quantity used to derive \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 from the 1720-1612 MHz line pair of\nOH. In removing the systematic effects, we have\nused the OH redshift as a fiducial, so the corrected\npoints are only as precise as the OH zero point.\nCorrection for \u03b1-independent effects is equivalent\nto requiring all measurements to produce the same\nvalue of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 , which is exactly what the correction procedure has produced. The systematics\ncorrections thus reduce the number of independent \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 values to just two. The correction for\nsystematic effects between species reveals that -\ncontrary to the small statistical error bars on apparent measurements between species - the most\nprecise measurement involving OH lines is the OHonly measurement obtained from the OH satellite\nlines.\n\nThe expressions for comparisons of CO and H I\nto \u03a3\u03bd and \u2206\u03bd are identical to those presented in\nDarling (2003).\nOH-H I and OH-CO line pairs show highly\nsignificant offsets in the apparent value of \u03b1 at\nz = 0.24671 (\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 = (\u22121.223 \u00b1 0.054) \u00d7 10\u22125\nand \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 = (\u22122.98 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10\u22125 respectively), but are these offsets due to a changing\n\u03b1 or are they due to systematic errors and/or\nvelocity offsets between species? We are confident that the simultaneous observations of OH\nand H I conducted at the GBT produce reliable\nrelative offsets between lines and we can thus exclude many systematic effects related to the atmosphere, telescope, doppler tracking, backend,\nand data reduction pathways. To assess the possibility that the offset is a physical velocity difference between the H I and OH gas, we employ the\npure hyperfine zHI \u2212 z\u2206\u03bd estimate of the systematics: \u2206zsys (OH \u2212 HI) = (7.78 \u00b1 5.77) \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\n5\n\n\f6.\n\nthan in blind searches for intervening absorption\nline systems.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur observations of the 18 cm OH lines support a scenario of radiatively pumped stimulated\nabsorption and emission with pumping dominated\nby the intraladder 119 \u03bcm line of OH, suggesting\na column density N (OH) \u2243 1015 \u20131016 cm\u22122 . The\nOH alone, in which conjugate line profiles guarantee that both lines originate in the same molecular gas, provides a weak constraint on the evolution of the fine structure constant of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 =\n(+0.51 \u00b1 1.26) \u00d7 10\u22125 . This result illustrates the\nneed for higher frequency OH line detections to\nprovide a larger lever arm on \u2206\u03b1, but it also illustrates the power of the OH molecule to provide\nprecise measurements of the cosmic evolution of\n\u03b1 that include quantitative constraints on systematic errors. We obtain a highly significant (\u223c 25\u03c3)\nvelocity offset between the OH and H I and the OH\nand CO lines which is entirely attributable to systematic velocity offsets between species. The OHHI offset is likely to be a physical velocity offset\n(perhaps due to different physical locations in the\nextended absorber), and the OH-CO offset may be\na combination of physical and measurement-based\nsystematics. We obtain a marginally significant\n(2.9\u03c3) HI-CO offset which the OH observations\nindicate is likely due to systematic effects, as anticipated by Carilli et al. (2000).\nDetection of conjugate OH lines at higher redshifts will provide new constraints on the cosmic\nevolution of physical constants. While the detection of new centimeter and millimeter molecular\nabsorption systems has proved to be a difficult\nand thus far fruitless task, recent and future improvements in frequency coverage, instantaneous\nbandwidth, sensitivity, and RFI mitigation should\nfacilitate new discoveries in the near future. There\nis room for optimism for detecting conjugate OH\nlines at high redshift because, like absorption lines\nand weak maser lines, the strength of conjugate\nOH lines depends only on the flux density of the\nbackground radio continuum source and not on\nthe redshift. Also, as Frayer, Seaquist, & Frail\n(1998) point out, the density, temperature, and\nmolecular column density conditions required to\nform conjugate OH lines are common in the centers of active galaxies, so conjugate OH lines may\nbe most efficiently identified in searches for intrinsic absorption in radio loud active galaxies rather\n\nWe are grateful to the hardworking staff at\nNRAO Green Bank for observing and data reduction support, especially Karen O'Neil, Bob Garwood, and Carl Bignell. We also thank the anonymous referee for constructive and insightful comments.\n\n6\n\n\fA.\n\nQuantifying Systematic Offsets Between Species\n\nRedshift offsets between species with the same \u03b1 dependence will to first order quantify the net systematic\neffects, be they instrumental, propagation effects, or physical velocity differences between species. Hence, in\nthe case of H I and the (to first order) pure hyperfine quantity \u2206\u03bd derived from the frequency differences\nbetween pairs of main or satellite OH lines, we expect redshift differences to be a measure of systematics\nrather than changes in fundamental constants: zHI \u2212 z\u2206\u03bd = \u2206zsys . The derived \u2206zsys should then be\napplied as a correction to the \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 values obtained from H I-OH line pairs.\nSystematic corrections can also be measured and applied in cases where there is no convenient cancellation\nof \u03b1 terms; only different \u03b1 dependencies are required. For example, comparison of the sum and difference,\n\u03a3\u03bd and \u2206\u03bd, of an OH main or satellite line pair to a transition in species X with dependence \u03b1\u03b3 will give\nzX \u2212 z\u03a3\u03bd\nzX \u2212 z\u2206\u03bd\n\n\u2206\u03b1\n+ \u2206zsys\n\u03b1\u25e6\n\u2206\u03b1\n= \u03b2\u2206 (1 + z\u2206\u03bd )\n+ \u2206zsys\n\u03b1\u25e6\n\n= \u03b2\u03a3 (1 + z\u03a3\u03bd )\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03b2\u2206 = 4 \u2212 \u03b3, \u03b2\u03a3 = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3 with \u03b7 = 0.4 for 2 \u03a03/2 and \u03b7 = 5 for 2 \u03a01/2 states, and \u2206zsys represents an\naverage \u03b1-independent offset between species. The requirement of a consistent measurement of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 from\nboth line comparisons provides a solution for \u2206zsys :\n\u2206zsys = zX +\n\nz\u03a3\u03bd \u03b2\u2206 \u2212 z\u2206\u03bd \u03b2\u03a3\n.\n\u03b2\u03a3 \u2212 \u03b2\u2206\n\n(A3)\n\nIn the case where \u03b2\u03a3 = \u03b2\u2206 , there is no leverage on \u2206zsys and systematics cannot be quantified. In the case\nwhere \u03b2\u03a3 = 0 or \u03b2\u2206 = 0 (which is the case for H I), \u2206zsys can be measured directly from the \u03b1-canceled\nline pair.\n\n7\n\n\fPerlman, E. S., Stocke, J.

A linear or quadratic fit to the spectral baseline has been subtracted from each spectrum.\nThe H I spectrum has been scaled down by a factor of 20 and the OH spectra have been offset from zero by\n\u221215, \u22125, 5, and 15 mJy for the 1612, 1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz lines, respectively. The dashed lines show\nthe 4 gaussian components fit to the H I profile. The positive features in the H I spectrum are RFI, and\nthe broad H I component (H I 4) may be an artifact of this interference. Shaded regions in the 1720 MHz\nspectrum at 31 and 4 km s\u22121 are regions where RFI was excised and no on-sky data exists.\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 2.- Changes in the fine structure constant measured from pairs of OH, H I, and CO lines at z = 0.24671\ntoward PKS 1413+135. Circles with solid error bars are apparent changes measured from redshift pairs, and\nthe squares with dotted error bars are \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 values corrected for systematic offsets between species. Note\nthat from four lines, there are only three independent apparent \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 values, and only two independent\nsystematics-corrected values. The \u2206\u03bd/H I quantity is not a true measure of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 ; it is a measure of\nthe \u03b1-independent systematic offset between the OH and HI redshifts, translated into a \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u25e6 measure to\nindicate the magnitude of the correction applied to the apparent OH-H I values. The OH and H I lines were\nobserved in a barycentric frame, but the CO reference frame is heliocentric; the difference between frames is\nof order 10 m s\u22121 , which is an order of magnitude less than the uncertainty in the H I and CO line centroids.\nThe CO redshift refers to the strongest CO J = 0 \u2192 1 line observed by Wiklind & Combes (1997).\n\n10\n\n\fTable 1\nObserved and Fit Properties of OH and H I Lines Toward PKS 1413+135\nLine\n\nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nH\nH\nH\nH\n\nGaussian Fits\n\n1612\n1665a\n1667a\n1720\nI 1b\nI2\nI3\nI4\n\n\u03bdc\nMHz\n\nzc\n\n1293.2502 \u00b1 0.0015\n***\n***\n1380.1238 \u00b1 0.0037\n1139.3282 \u00b1 0.0014\n1139.3660 \u00b1 0.0026\n1139.2886 \u00b1 0.0193\n1139.2775 \u00b1 0.0112\n\n0.2466505 \u00b1 0.0000014\n***\n***\n0.2466490 \u00b1 0.0000034\n0.2467046 \u00b1 0.0000015\n0.2466633 \u00b1 0.0000028\n0.246748 \u00b1 0.000021\n0.246760 \u00b1 0.000012\n\nSc\nmJy\n\n\u03c4c\n\n\u221211.67 \u00b1 0.93\n(1.3)\n(1.1)\n+11.7 \u00b1 2.0\n\u2212594 \u00b1 20\n\u2212165 \u00b1 52\n\u221276 \u00b1 55\n\u221236 \u00b1 5\n\n0.0098 \u00b1 0.0008\n(0.0011)\n(0.0009)\n\u22120.0097 \u00b1 0.0017\n0.68 \u00b1 0.03\n0.15 \u00b1 0.05\n0.07 \u00b1 0.05\n0.030 \u00b1 0.004\n\n\u2206V\nkm s\u22121\n8.7 \u00b1 0.8\n***\n***\n10.1 \u00b1 1.9\n12.6 \u00b1 1.8\n8.1 \u00b1 1.2\n12.3 \u00b1 5.4\n65.8 \u00b1 6.8\n\nR\n\n\u03c4 dV\n\nkm s\u22121\n0.091\n***\n***\n\u22120.108\n13.4c\n\na The 1665 and 1667 MHz lines were not detected.
