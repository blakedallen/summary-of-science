The\ncharacteristics of bacterial motility and aggregation depend on numerous biological and chemical parameters,\nwhich include light exposure, temperature, concentration\nof food or of other substances, and lead to the existence\nof many classes of cell motion. Since a bacterium cannot utilize electromagnetic or acoustic radiation to sense\nits environment, it must rely on physical contact and its\nmotility may depend on the production, diffusion and\ndegradation of a relevant set of sensed chemicals. These\nchemicals are called chemoattractants or chemorepellants\nif they attract or repel bacteria, respectively. Examples of chemoattractants include food - sugars and amino\nacids - whereas antiobiotics, fatty acids or other noxious\nsubstances are chemorepellant.\nA prototype and well studied example of bacterial\nmotility is the run and tumble mechanism used by Escherichia coli in liquid environments. The specialized\nstructures allowing for cellular motion are known as flagellae, spinning helical tails which extend from the cellular\nmembrane into the surrounding environment: counterclockwise rotation of the flagellar motor leads to a onedirectional run whereas clockwise rotation causes tumbling along a random direction. During its run, an E.coli\ncell periodically senses for chemosensitive substances,\nand, by comparing concentration levels in new and old\nenvironments, adjusts its motion and its likelihood to\ntumble in a new, randomly chosen, direction [3, 4]. If\nthe cell is moving in the direction of increasing attractant, for instance, the probability of tumbling is lowered,\nso that the run time and 'mean free path' length in this\ndirection are increased. An E.coli cell, thus, compares\n\nchemical concentrations at nearby points, so that its future motion is determined by a chemical gradient [5, 6]\nvia the mechanism of chemotaxis.\nChemotaxis may occur in other non-acqueous systems,\nsuch as in colonies of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus or of the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum (slimemould) which crawl on agar plates [7]. The exact regulatory mechanism leading to the surface gliding of these\nrod-like and slow moving organisms is yet unknown, and\nresponses to external stimuli appear to be more complex than in enteric bacteria such as E .coli [8]. The\ncells undergo chemotaxis, but lack, or show very modest, responses to specific nutrient stimuli [9, 10], suggesting that the chemotactic behavior is due mainly to\nself-generated signaling chemicals [11]. The fact that cell\ndensity regulates typical reversal frequencies may be a\nconsequence of one bacteria sensing the higher levels of\nsignaling chemical in the presence of others [12]. In particular, under starving conditions, the cells are driven by\nauto-released fibril trails to aggregate and form multicellular compounds called fruiting bodies. These compounds raise above the agar plate and eventually sporulate into new and more resistant organisms which are\nthen released to the environment in search of new sources\nof nutrients.\nOne major difference between these systems and enteric bacteria is that the chemoattractants embedded in\nor self-deposited on the agar plates are relatively immobile on the time scale of bacterial motility, whereas\nchemoattractant substances in acqueous environments\nhave a finite diffusion constant. Like E.coli, the gliding\ncells can only sense what they come into immediate contact with, and since the chemosensitive substance diffuses\nslowly, large fibril concentration differences exist over the\nlength of the cell. The gradient driving the chemotaxis\nmechanism is then determined between positions within\na cell body length, as opposed to the large distances in-\n\n\fPhysical Review E, 68, 021925, 2003\nvolved in enteric bacteria chemotaxis.\nAnother possible mechanism driving cellular motility\nis chemokinesis. Here, changes in the direction of motion or in the cell velocity are determined locally, without recourse to the determination of concentration gradients. Chemokinesis may be a function of temperature,\nsubstrate adhesion, salt concentration or substances affecting the internal metabolism of the cell, slowing or\nenhancing its motion or turning frequency [13].\nThe observed patterns of movement of M. xanthus and\nof slime-mould suggest that the motility of these systems\nmay be affected by self-induced chemokinesis as well as\nself-induced chemotaxis. M. xanthus move by shooting\nout and retracting pili from the ends of their prolate bodies [14, 15]. In nutritionally abundant environments or\nunder conditions of high population density, both cellular systems generate repulsive fibril trails, leading to cell\ndispersion and the colonization of new regions of the agar\nplate. The mechanism is hypothesized to be dictated by\nchemokinesis [16, 17].\nPrevious theoretical studies into the collective dynamics of interacting motile bacteria, both of E. coli and M.\nxanthus type, include coarse-grained convective-diffusive\ntransport type models [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and latticetype simulations [23, 24, 25]. These studies have considered the effects of interactions with concentration fields,\nmodeling chemotaxis or chemokinesis or, as in Ref. [26],\nboth chemosensitive mechanisms. The continuum theories take into account turning rates, and changes in speed\nor direction of motion, however they generally ignore long\ntime path history effects induced by the sensed chemicals.\nIn these systems, the bias to the motion arises from an\nexternal, fixed stimulus and not a dynamical one. Similar\nstudies - with a fixed external trail - have been presented\nin different contexts, such as the aggregation of ants due\nto chemotaxis [27]. Other authors [28] have presented\nsystems in which the fibril trail that dictates the motion\nof the cells is determined over an extended area and is\nnot sensed locally.\nThe aim of this paper is to model and disentangle\nthe effects of self-generated chemotaxis and chemokinesis, acting individually or concurrently and under diverse\nattractrant and repulsive conditions. In contrast to many\nof the previous studies, the chemical trail of our systems\nwill emerge from the motion of the bacterial cells and\nevolve with the cellular motion itself. Observations of\nindividual organism paths may be more revealing of cellular dynamics than multicellular ensembles, and we restrict our attention to the behavior of a single bacterium.\nEven if isolated, the dynamics of this single cell will be\naffected by its self-secreted fibril trail, and the resulting\npattern will be that of a self-interacting random walker.\nWe shall try to understand cellular motion by developing,\nand analytically solving, the equations of motion for an\nisolated M. xanthus cell under a mean-field approximation, and by means of simple Monte-Carlo simulations,\nincorporating chemotaxis and chemokinesis to various degrees. The underlying assumption of this paper is that\n\nw\n0\n\nv0\nl\n\nX(t)\n\nFIG. 1: The trajectory of a single bacterium of width w and\nlength l crawling in one dimension and depositing chemoattractant (or repellent) on the surface. The density of shading\nof the footprint is proportional to the total attractant deposited and arises from the hypothetical trajectory depicted\nby the arrows beneath. For the sake of simplicity, we have\nneglected the cell length l in the depiction of the trajectory.\n\nthe chemosensitive material acts as a regulator of cell motion affecting only the frequency of direction reversal, via\nchemokinesis or chemotaxis. The speed of the bacterium\nis assumed constant in either direction and is controlled\nby inherent cellular bio-energetics.\nExperimental single cell trajectories show that an isolated cell travels along its axis, occasionally veering off,\nand for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider onedimensional dynamics. In order to validate our models,\ncell particle tracking can be eventually performed in onedimensional etchings or imprints into the agar plates.\n\nII.\n\nCONSTANT REVERSAL RATES\n\nIn this Section we derive a general Fokker-Planck equation for the single one-dimensional random walker. As\ndiscussed in the Introduction, we assume that the 'bacterium', or particle, travels with constant speed v0 , and\nis subject to an ad hoc directional reverse mechanism\nthat incorporates both chemotaxis and chemokinesis. To\nstart, we ignore the effect of both phenomena, and we\nsimply investigate the role of a constant reversal rate.\nThe probability that a bacterium is centered at position x at time t with velocity \u00b1v0 will be denoted by\nP\u00b1 (x, t) and the probability of a directional switch in\ntime dt is dt/\u03c4 = \u03b3 dt.

The\nFourier transform of the distribution functions yields the\nmoments of the random walker cell from which the cumulants can be extracted.\n\nIII.\n\nCHEMOKINESIS AND CHEMOTAXIS\n\nWe now consider the generation and sensing of\nchemoattactant or chemorepellant, and its effect on the\nreversal rates \u03b3\u00b1 . M. xanthus cells deposit attractant\n\nchemical matter contained within a fibril slime under the\narea of cell contact. We assume that the release of the\nchemoattractant occurs at a constant rate and uniformly\nover the cell-substrate footprint. In general, for a cell of\nlength l, the fibril concentration \u03c6(x, t) obeys the following equation:\n\u03c6\u0307(x, t) = D\u22072 \u03c6(x, t) +\nr\u0398[l/2 \u2212 |x \u2212 X(t)|] \u2212 rd \u03c6(x, t),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the chemical is generated at a constant rate r per\nunit area. The Heaviside function \u0398 in Eq. (9) limits\nthe increase in fibril concentration to the region strictly\nunder the footprint of the bacterium centered at X(t),\nwhereas degradation and diffusion are included via the\nterms proportional to rd and D. If the surface-deposited\nchemoattractant does not diffuse appreciably and D\u22072 \u03c6\nis neglected, we find:\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(x, 0)e\u2212rd t +\n(10)\nZ t\n\u2032\nr\ndt\u2032 erd (t \u2212t) \u0398[l/2 \u2212 |x \u2212 X(t\u2032 )|].\n0\n\nNote that \u03c6(x, t) depends on the entire history of the\ntrajectory X(t\u2032 ) up to time t\u2032 = t. To couple the fibril\nconcentration with cell dynamics, we must now include\na relation between \u03b3\u00b1 (x, t) and \u03c6(x, t). This relationship\nwill depend on the particular mechanism of cell direction\nreversal and various choices will be discussed in the following subsections. It is important to note that, since\nwe are assuming that fibril sensing is the main factor\nin determining direction reversals, we are also implicitly\nassuming that the sensing process, for example via a biochemical network within the bacterium, is much faster\nthan the typical time for a cell to have moved appreciably. If we further take the molecular sensing apparatus to\nbe distributed uniformly at the cell substrate footprint,\nthe total chemoattractant \u03a6(X(t), t) sensed at time t is\njust the local contribution integrated over the cellular\nlength:\n\n\u03a6(X(t), t) = w\n\nZ\n\nX(t)+l/2\n\n\u03c6(x, t)dx,\n\n(11)\n\nX(t)\u2212l/2\n\nwhere w is the width of the cell as depicted in Fig. 1.\nA.\n\nChemokinesis\n\nLet us consider the case of chemokinesis first. Here,\nthe reversal rate depends only on the integrated fibril\nconcentration. We will assume no intrinsic drift and\nset \u03b3(x, t) = \u03b3+ (x, t) = \u03b3\u2212 (x, t). It is also reasonable\nto expect the switching probability to saturate for large\nenough fibril concentration, when the cell cannot respond\nto further increases in fibril levels. A plausible functional\n\n\fPhysical Review E, 68, 021925, 2003\ndependence for \u03b3 on the total sensed chemoattractant \u03a6\nis of the type found in cooperative chemical binding, a\nMichaelis-Menten form with Hill coefficient \u03b2, so that for\na cell at position X(t) = x, the reversal rate is:\n\nleads to the conclusion that the Green's matrix function\nis given by:\n(0)\n\nG(x, t) =\n\u03b3(x, t) = \u03b30 + \u03ba(x, t),\n\u03a6\u03b2 (x, t)\n,\n= \u03b30 + \u03b4p \u03b2\n\u03a60 + \u03a6\u03b2 (x, t)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03a60 and \u03b2, the inflection parameter and transition\nsharpness (or Hill coefficient), are peculiar to the system\nbeing considered. The effect of chemokinesis is measured\nby \u03b4p; with the unbiased choice \u03b30 = 1/2, \u03b4p is limited\nto \u22121/2 \u2264 \u03b4p \u2264 1/2.\nWe must now solve Eqns. (4) and (5) with the above\nspatial and temporal dependence for \u03b3(x, t), which in\nturn depends on the concentration \u03a6(x, t) via Eqns. (10)\nand (11). The latter equations carry an explicit dependence on the past history of the walker. Our approach\nwill be to consider the \u03b30 contribution of Eq. (12) as giving rise to Eqns. (4) and (5) with constant reversal rates,\nand find its associated Green's function. The \u03ba(x, t) term\nin \u03b3(x, t) of Eq. (12) then generates non-homogeneous differential equations, whose solution may be obtained via\nthe known Green's function. We will then be able to construct an iterative process to obtain P (x, t) as a function\nof all preceeding probabilities P (x\u2032 , t\u2032 < t). To build the\nGreen's matrix function G(x, t), we note that Eqns. (4)\nand (5) can be written as:\n\u1e56(x, t) = M(x) P(x, t),\n\n(13)\n\nT\n\nwhere P(x, t) = [P+ (x, t), P\u2212 (x, t)] and\n\nM(x) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212v0 \u2202x \u2212 \u03b3+\n\u03b3\u2212\n\u03b3+\nv0 \u2202x \u2212 \u03b3\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nFor the case of generic \u03b3\u00b1 , independent of (x, t), the solution to this equation, with the initial conditions expressed by Eqns. (6) is given by Eqns. (7) and (8). In\nthe case \u03b3+ = \u03b3\u2212 = \u03b30 we refer to these solutions as\n(0)\n(0)\nP+ (x, t) and P\u2212 (x, t). The Green's function for this\nproblem stems from the modified matrix equation:\n\u0120(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t \u2265 0) = M(x) G(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t) +\n1\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(t),\nG(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t < 0) = 0.\n\nP\n\n(0)\n\n(x, t) =\n\nP+\n(0)\nP\u2212\n\n!\n\n(x, t) = G(x, t)\n\n\u0012\n\na+\na\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThis result can also be verified by direct evaluation of\nG(k, \u03c9) in Fourier space. From Eqns. (4) and (5) it\nfollows that reversal rates of the type \u03b3\u00b1 (x, t) = \u03b30 +\n\u03ba\u00b1 (x, t) yield a new matrix equation:\n\u1e56(x, t) = M(x)P(x, t) + K(x, t)P(x, t).\n\n(19)\n\nwhere:\nK(x, t) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03ba+ (x, t) \u03ba\u2212 (x, t)\n\u03ba+ (x, t) \u2212\u03ba\u2212 (x, t)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThe resulting equation for P (x, t) can be solved iteratively:\nP(x, t) = P(0) (x, t) +\n(21)\nZ t\nZ \u221e\ndt\u2032\ndx\u2032 G(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 ) K(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) P(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ).\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn the case of chemokinesis, the non-homogeneous term\n\u03ba+ (x, t) = \u03ba\u2212 (x, t) is contained in Eq. (12). In order\nto simplify the expression for \u03a6(x, t), we assume unit\ncell width and take the limit of cellular length l \u2192 0.\nWe also neglect diffusion and decay of the fibril. Under\nthese assumptions, \u03c6\u0307(x, t) = rl\u03b4(x \u2212 X(t)) and \u03a6(x, t) =\nwl\u03c6(x, t). The problem is now a deterministic one, as\nexemplified by the delta-function in the expression for\n\u03c6\u0307. In order to apply Eq. (21), which gives the statistical\nprobability for one bacterium to lie at (x, t), we need to\nknow its exact location at X(t\u2032 ) for all previous times. In\nother words, the complete history of the cell is needed to\ndetermine future motion and solutions cannot be found.\nNevertheless, we can approximate P\u00b1 (x, t) by an averaged density \u03c1\u00b1 , utilizing a mean field theory approach.\nHere, we average the probabilities P\u00b1 for a single walker\nover many distinct independent realizations, so that the\nself interaction is to be expressed on the average of all\nreplicas of the system, and does not depend on the history of individual walkers. We can now rewrite the equation for the fibril concentration as:\n\u03c6\u0307(x, t) = rl\u03c1(x, t),\n\n(22)\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere we indicate the total bacterial density by \u03c1(x, t).\nThe above relationship signifies that, on average, fibril\ngrowth is proportional to the total density of bacteria at\n(x, t).

An equation similar to Eq. (24) can be obtained for\nthe total density \u03c1(x, t), which depends on \u2206\u03c1(x, t):\n\nsystems. In the limit of cellular length l \u2192 0, the above\nexpressions are written as:\n\n\u03bc\u00b1 (x, t) = exp [\u2213\u03c3\u03c6x (x, t)]\n\nwhere the \u03c6x = \u2202\u03c6/\u2202x. We use this exponential function\nto capture the sensitive chemical signalling, such as that\nfound in E. coli [30]. Another alternative for the function\n\u03bc\u00b1 is to include a saturation in the form of \u03c6x /\u03c6 in the\nexponent of (27).\nWe assume the reversal probabilities \u03b3\u00b1 (x, t) at position (x, t) to depend on \u03bc\u00b1 (x, t) through the following:\n\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u03c1(0) (x, t) +\n(25)\nZ t\nZ \u221e\n\u2032 \u2032 \u03b2 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2206\u03c1(x , t )\u03c6 (x , t )\n.\n\u03b4p\ndt\u2032\ndx\u2032 h(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\u03c6\u03b20 + \u03c6\u03b2 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n0\n\u2212\u221e\nHere, h = \u2212g11 + g12 \u2212 g21 + g22 and is odd in x, as required by the normalization of both \u03c1(x, t) and \u03c10 (x, t).\nIt is useful to note that the above recursive equations\nmay be used to evaluate the number density n(x, t) for a\nsystem of N interacting bacteria as well. In this case, the\ndistribution function n\u00b1 (x, t) = N \u03c1\u00b1 (x, t) and the evolution equations are the same as (24) and (25) provided\nwe redefine \u03c60 = N n0 . Equations (23), (24) and (25) can\nnow be solved numerically.

Again, we must resort to the\nmean field calculation of the densities \u03c1(x, t) and \u2206\u03c1(x, t)\nby means of the Green's matrix function.

Let us consider chemotaxis as the sole reversal\nmechanism for a cell of length l traveling at v0 speed in\nthe positive direction, and situated at position X(t) = x.\nThe chemical gradient over the cellular length will drive\nthe reversal rate. To specify the relation between gradient and reversal probabilities, we first introduce the\nprobability terms \u03bc\u00b1 (x, t):\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c6(x + l/2, t) \u2212 \u03c6(x \u2212 l/2, t)\n, (26)\n\u03bc\u00b1 (x, t) = exp \u2213\u03c3\nl\nwhere \u03c3 is a constant that measures the strength of\nchemotaxis. For positive \u03c3, the above expression translates into a low reversal probability whenever \u03c6(x +\nl/2, t) > \u03c6(x \u2212 l/2, t) so that the cell is likely to keep\nmoving speed at +v0 . This means we are modeling an\nattractant fibril trail. On the other hand, negative values\nof \u03c3 will represent a chemorepellant system. The same\nargument can be presented for a bacterium traveling at\n\u2212v0 speed. In this case, the direction of motion tends\nto persist for negative gradients, hence the expression for\n\u03bc\u2212 (x, t), where positive \u03c3 values signify chemoattractant\n\nand Eq. (21) still holds. Note that since \u03bc\u2212 (x, t) =\n\u03bc\u22121\n+ (x, t), then \u03ba+ (x, t) + \u03ba\u2212 (x, t) = 0.

The\ntime scale is n = 600 time steps in units of \u2206t = 0.05. In the\nchemokinesis curves \u03c60 = 0.2, close to the saturation limit of\nthe Michaelis-Menten form of Eq. 12.\n\nculating \u2206\u03c1(0) (x, t) and by adding to it the sum over all\nprevious time steps t\u2032 < t of the integrand. Of these\nterms, the last one, at t = t\u2032 , contains the kernel function g(x \u2212 x\u2032 , 0) = \u22122\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ), which, when integrated\nover space, extracts a term proportional to the quantity of interest, \u2206\u03c1(x, t). The other contributions of the\nsum, for t 6= t\u2032 , are spatial integrals, that are evaluated as sums after the discretization over the x\u2032 variable.\nThese sums contain the known values of \u2206\u03c1(x\u2032 , t\u2032 < t),\nas well as \u03ba(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) which depends on the fibril concentration \u03c6(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ). The latter is just the integrated \u03c1(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )\nas follows from Eq. (23). In order to evaluate \u03c6(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ), a\ntime discretized summation over the \u03c1(x\u2032 , t\u2032 < t) values is\ncarried out. The assumption here is that the bacterium\nsenses the environment before laying down new fibril, so\nthat the concentration \u03c6(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) is evaluated not by the\ntrapeziodal rule, in which the extrema of the integration\nregion are weighed each as 1/2, but by weighing t = 0\nwith 1 and ignoring t = t\u2032 . In the case of chemokinesis,\nonce \u2206\u03c1(x, t) is determined, \u03c1(x, t), which depends on\n\u2206\u03c1(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ), can be calculated in the same way.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the results for \u03c1(x, t) for a system under chemokinesis. The meshes are set at \u2206x = \u2206t = 0.05\nand the maximum time step, in these units is t = 600.\nCell velocity is fixed at v0 = 1 and the parameter\n\u03c60 = 0.2. For chemoattractant fibril, or \u03b4p > 0, the\ndistribution is narrower than the bare \u03b4p = 0 case, also\nplotted in the graph. Negative values of \u03b4p represent\nchemorepulsion and broaden the distribution, eventually\nleading to a plateau-like region. The existence of the\nplateau is due to the fact that for large negative values\nof \u03b4p \u2243 \u22121/2 the reversal rate at saturation is almost\nzero, leading to ballistic motion of the cell in the region\nwhere the fibril has been deposited.

The time\nscale is n = 600 time steps in units of \u2206t = 0.05.\n\nthe edge of the plateau region of fibril concentration, the\nreversal rate increases dramatically and the cell tends to\nreverse its motion and travel backwards, until the opposite side of the plateau region is reached. This behavior\naccounts for the uniformity of the distribution function in\nthe central region. Time evolution also tends to broaden\n- and consequently lower - the plateau region, since the\nbacteria tend to build up fibril at the edges, thus increasing the range of motion.\nFor the case of chemotaxis, \u03c1(x, t), is easier to evaluate,\nsince it can be calculated without recourse to \u2206\u03c1(x, t),\nas indicated by Eq. (31). The procedure is the same as\nthat outlined for the case of chemokinesis. We take the\ngradient appearing in the expressions for \u03bc\u00b1 to be evaluated over a distance l = 2, so that for x = xi and t = ti\nof the mesh we have:\nh \u03c3\ni\n\u03bc\u00b1 (xi , tj ) = exp \u2213 [\u03c6(xi+1 , tj ) \u2212 \u03c6(xi\u22121 , tj )] . (37)\n2\n\nResults are plotted in Fig.3. As discussed in the previous\nsection, positive (negative) values of \u03c3 indicate chemoattraction (chemorepulsion). It is interesting to note that\nfor large negative values of \u03c3 two peaks develop (only\none is seen from Fig. 3, the other is its symmetrical image in the x axis), with the bacteria traveling towards\nunexplored regions of space, void of fibril.\nWhen both mechanisms are present, chemotaxis and\nchemokinesis may enforce or compete against each other\nin their localizing or spreading effects. Chemoattractant\nvalues of \u03c3 > 0 for instance, contrast the ballistic tendency of \u03b4p < 0, and viceversa, chemorepulsive values\nof \u03c3 < 0 oppose the localizing effect of \u03b4p > 0. In Figures 5 through 7, we examine the interplay of the two\nmechanisms for several values of \u03c3 and \u03b4p.\n\n\fPhysical Review E, 68, 021925, 2003\ntraveling peak is washed out and a plateau region, typical\nof large positive \u03b4p values forms (Fig. 6). Finally, in the\nregime of \u03c3 > 0 and \u03b4p < 0, the localizing tendency due\nto chemoattraction is offset by the chemokinesis-plateau\ntendency. Unusual distribution function patterns may\narise as in the case of \u03c3 = 0.5 or \u03c3 = 1 and \u03b4p = \u22120.4 or\n\u03b4p = \u22120.48 in Fig. 5.\n\n\u03c3 = \u22120.5\n\u03c60 = 0.2\n0.06\nGaussian\n\u03b4p = 0.48\n\n\u03c1(x, t = 30)\n\n\u03b4p = 0.2\n0.04\n\n\u03b4p = 0.0\n\u03b4p = \u22120.2\n\u03b4p = \u22120.48\n\nV.\n\nMONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx\n\nFIG. 6: Distribution functions under chemotaxis, set at \u03c3 =\n\u22120.5, and chemokinesis set at various \u03b4p values.

We discretize space and time and assume the random walker cell to have finite length l.

We simultaneously model chemotaxis and\nchemokinesis through the dependence of \u03b3t on the self\nsecreted fibril concentration \u03c6(x, t), as in the continuum\ncase. Discretizing equations (9) and (11) we obtain:\n\n\u03c6t (x) =\n\nt\nX\n\n\u0398(l/2 \u2212 |x \u2212 Xs |), and\n\n(40)\n\ns=0\n\nFor both \u03c3, \u03b4p > 0 the distribution functions are localized about the central position, whereas for \u03c3, \u03b4p < 0\ntwo peaks traveling in opposite directions develop. The\nsharpness of these peaks increases with increasing |\u03c3|,\nas can be seen by comparing Figures 6 through 7. and\nthe localization position increases with increasing |\u03b4p| as\neach figure also shows. Competing effects arise when \u03b4p\nand \u03c3 are of opposite signs. For large negative values of\n\u03c3, the effect of positive \u03b4p values is simply to shift the\nmean of the spreading peak towards the origin (Figures\n7). For smaller negative values of \u03c3 increasing \u03b4p tends to\nlocalize the distribution functions at the origin, until the\n\n\u03a6t (x) =\n\nl/2\nX\n\n\u03c6t (Xt + x),\n\n(41)\n\nx=\u2212l/2\n\nwhere \u03c6t (x) is the amount of chemoattractant that has\nbuilt up at location x and \u03a6t is the total amount of\nchemoattractant sensed by the cell.

At these time scales, the general trends found\nin the analytic case persist for most combinations of\n(\u03c3, \u03b4p). The simulation results are summarized in a\nphase-diagram. Positive values of \u03b4p and \u03c3 both cause\nattractiveness in the system and we expect suppressed\nspreading of the distribution function. Negative values\nof \u03b4p and \u03c3 on the other hand cause repulsion and enhanced spreading. To quantify these effects, we compared\nthe distribution function P (x, tmax ) with a normalized\nGaussian, corresponding to the parameters \u03c3 = \u03b4p = 0.\nMore specifically, we compare the integral of the reference\nGaussian at the curvature inflexion points to the integral\nof the probability distribution function between the same\nlimits. If the integral of the PDF is less than that of the\ncorresponding Gaussian, the dynamics is classified as being suppressed. This definition is shown in Fig. 9(top).\nWe explore the entire phase space \u03b4p and \u03c3 and find the\ncrossover from one regime to the other. The enhanced\nor suppressed diffusive character of the PDF curves may\nevolve from that of the early time regime, but it is found\nthat after t = 103 simulation time steps the classification\nis stable. The phase diagram is shown in Fig. 9(bottom).\nFor \u03c3, \u03b4p > 0, both kinesis and chemotaxis effects suppress the diffusivity of the trajectories. Only for \u03c3 < 0\ncan the spreading dynamics be enhanced. Due to our\nchoice of the functional forms of the effects (Eqs. 12 and\n26), the dynamics are much more sensitive to \u03c3 that \u03b4p,\nnonetheless, the effects of kinesis induces an asymmetry\nin \u03b4p in the phase diagram. The curve approaches the\nlimits \u03b4p = \u00b10.5 asymptotically.\n\n(45)\n\nIn Fig. 8 we compare the results from the Monte Carlo\nsimulations and the mean-field approximation of the\nprevious section, for small times, for a typical case of\nchemokinesis and chemotaxis.\nWe can now analyze results of the Monte-Carlo simulations for longer times than in the analytic case: tmax =\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we presented a mean field model and\nMonte-Carlo simulations for bacterial dynamics under\nthe mechanisms of chemokinesis and chemotaxis acting\nconcurrently. The bacterial motion is that of a onedimensional self-interacting random walker. The fibril\ntrail that governs the dynamics of the system is itself a\ndynamical quantity that depends on the past motion of\nthe cells. We model the two mechanisms in terms of two\ncharacterizing parameters, \u03c3 and \u03b4p, which represent, respectively, the degree of chemotaxis and chemokinesis.\nThe mean-field results agree with Monte-Carlo simulations in the limit of short times. For long times we find a\nphase-diagram in (\u03c3 - \u03b4p) space that separates enhanced\nor suppressed diffusion regimes. In contrast to the shorttime numerics displayed in Figs. 2-7, which show PDFs\nindicative of enhanced diffusion for \u03b4p < 0, the long time\nphase diagram exhibits suppressed diffusion provided \u03c3 is\nnegative and |\u03b4p| is not too large. Therefore, in the longtime limit, kinesis modeled by the logistic saturation,\nEq. (12), results in suppressed diffusion in the absence\nof chemorepellent effects (\u03c3 < 0). We have investigated\nthe effects of increased cooperativity in the biochemical\nsignaling through the \u03b2 parameter. As can be seen from\nFig.9 increased \u03b2 values do not significantly affect the\n\n\fPhysical Review E, 68, 021925, 2003\n\nEnhanced diffusion\n0.30\n\nSuppressed diffusion\n\nP(x)\n\nGaussian\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\u22121200.0\n\n0.0\n\n1200.0\n\nx\n\nphase diagram\n0.5\n\n\u03b4p\n\n\u03b2=1\n\u03b2=4\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.20\n\nsuppressed\ndiffusion\n\nenhanced\ndiffusion\n\n\u22120.60\n\n0.00\n\n0.60\n\n1.20\n\n\u03c3\n\nFIG. 9: (top) Gaussian and suppressed and enhanced PDFs.\n(bottom) \u03c3 \u2212 \u03b4p phase diagram at t = 105 for \u03b2 = 1, 4.\nThe crossover between suppressed and enhanced diffusion was\nfound by Monte-Carlo simulations and determining the point\nat which the integral of the reference Gaussian between the\ncurvature inflexion points is equal to that of the distribution\nfunctions.\n\nphase-diagram curve.\nThe model exhibits variations in shapes of the particle\nPDF.

For a single cell constrained to move along a 1D\nagar track, the relevant parameters (\u03c3, \u03b4p and \u03b2) of our\nmodel can be tuned to identify the correct mechanism of\nmotion. Moreover, the motion of freely moving A-type\nmyxobacteria cells is locally one-dimensional. Our model\n\ndoes not account for contact interactions between cells,\nrather, cells interact indirectly via trails of self-secreted\nslime. This simplification enables us to study the details\nof the effects of the history-dependent fibril concentration. Direct cell-cell signalling interactions on a 2D aggregating colony are known to lead to the formation of\ncomplex structures such as propagating rippling waves\nand spiraling fruiting bodies [10, 32]. Although the investigation of contact interactions between cells is beyond\nthe scope of this paper, our approach does not preclude\nthe formation of propagating waves and associated rippling patterns in systems where fibril-mediated cell-cell\ninteractions are included.\nThe authors are grateful for the assistance of G.\nLakatos in improving the implementation of our simulations and numerical computations.
