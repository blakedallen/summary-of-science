INTRODUCTION\n\nII. WAKE FIELD OSCILLATIONS\n\nA wakefield is generally defined as a net positive space\ncharge region residing downstream from a dust particle\nwithin a complex plasma. Wakefields are thought to be\ngenerated through an ion focusing effect created when\npositively charged ions stream from the plasma toward\nthe lower electrode and are then reflected by suspended\nnegatively charged dust particles [1, 2]. The resulting\npositive space-charge region gives rise to an attractive\ninteraction between the negatively charged particles. One\napparent effect of this attractive force is the alignment of\nthe dust particles in the vertical direction, creating twothree- or even longer particle chains. Particles within such\na chain are acted upon by the gravitational force, the\nsheath potential, the Yukawa potential, and the wake field\npotential. Therefore stable, vertical dust particle chains in\ncomplex plasmas provide an ideal platform for\ninvestigating the ion wakefield potential as well as the\nattractive/repulsive forces acting on the dust particles [3,\n4].\nA two-particle chain provides the simplest unit structure\nfor such a particle chain system. In general, a more\nmassive particle resides at the lower position within the\nchain with a less massive one directly above due to the\ngravitational force acting on the particles [3].\nMathematically a two-particle system has an exact set of\nsolutions and recent computer simulations of the\nwakefield space charge distribution for this system predict\nan attractive force region between the two dust particles\n[5].\nExperimentally, two-particle chains frequently appear\nspontaneously under typical laboratory dusty plasma\n\nThe wakefield potential downstream from a stationary\ndust particle can be theoretically described as [1]:\n\n\u2217\n\u03be\n\nemail: J_Kong@baylor.edu\nemail: Truell_Hyde@baylor.edu\n\n% w (r = 0, y ) \"\n\nQD 2 cos(y Ls )\n4#$ 0 y 1 !

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe experiment described herein was conducted\nemploying the CASPER GEC rf reference cell [6]. A\nradio-frequency, capacitively coupled discharge was\nformed between two parallel-plate electrodes, 8 cm in\ndiameter and separated by 3 cm, with the bottom\nelectrode air-cooled. The lower electrode is powered by a\n\n\fradio-frequency signal generator, while the upper\nelectrode is grounded as is the chamber. The signal\ngenerator is coupled to the electrode through an\nimpedance matching network and a variable capacitor\nattenuator network. The plasma discharge apparatus is\ndescribed in greater detail in [7].\nTo expedite data collection, multiple frequencies with\nidentical amplitude were employed to drive the lower\nelectrode, where a Fourier transformation of the particle\nresponse was then used to obtain the final frequency\nspectrum. Input voltages were calculated as a function of\ntime\nfN\n\nVin = A ! sin (2\"f i t )\n\n(7)\n\nf i = f1\n\nwhere in the above, A is a constant. Fig. 3 shows\n\nVin as a\n\nfunction of time along with its corresponding fast Fourier\ntransformation. In the figure, f i runs from 10 Hz to\n\n20 Hz with a step size of 1Hz . These calculated\n\nVin\n\nvalues, along with a time step size of !t = 1 1200 s ,\nwere fed to the lower electrode through an Agilent\n33120A function generator in order to modulate the DC\n\nFigure 4.

Upon release, particles oscillate with attenuated\namplitudes until returning to their natural bias positions.\nFig. 5 shows this process for a two-particle pair along\nwith the corresponding Fourier transformations.\nExperimental conditions are identical to the previous case\ndiscussed other than the initial DC bias being held\nnegatively at a value 10V higher than the natural bias.\n\nFigure 3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nFigs. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b) show the spectrum for the upper\nparticle to have a very strong peak at the lower particle's\nresonance frequency, while the lower particle's spectrum\nshows only a weak peak at the top particle's resonance\nfrequency. The explanation for this phenomenon can be\nattributed to the interaction forces, where both Yukawa\nand wakefield are considered. As can be seen in the\nfigures, the bottom particle's vibration amplitude is larger,\nand the vibration duration time is longer. Both of these\nindicate that the bottom particle is being acted upon by a\nsmaller frictional coefficient. Additionally, the phase\ndifference between the oscillations of the two particles\ncreate a non-stable relative separation distance as can be\nseen in both particles' Fourier transformation spectrum.\nAssuming the interaction strength felt by both particles to\nbe the same, the relative amplitude of the Fourier\ntransformation spectrum will be dependent upon the\namplitudes of the vibration. This is manifested in the top\nparticle's Fourier transformation spectrum showing a\nstrong interaction peak, while the bottom spectrum shows\nonly a relatively weak one.\nSince the wakefield is formed downstream to a standing\nparticle, only the bottom particle should be acted upon by\nthe potential. Oscillations within the wakefield potential\nwell can be created by small displacements from\nequilibrium; since the bottom of the wakefield potential\nwell (fig. 1), will move along with the top particle, only\nwhen the two particles undergo relative motion should\nthere be an oscillation in the wakefield potential described\nin equation (5). A plan for observing such possible\noscillations will be described in a subsequent paper.\n\nV. SUMMARY\nThe wakefield potential generated by a dust particle\nresiding in the sheath of a plasma has been previously\nshown to create an attractive force on the particle\nunderneath. Theoretical wakefield potential distributions\nimply the existence of a potential well within this\npotential, providing a possible oscillation field for dust\nparticles trapped in the well. The oscillation frequency for\n\nsuch a well was derived in this paper, while the conditions\nnecessary for the experimental observation of any\nresulting oscillations were discussed. The wakefield\noscillation frequency was shown to be related to the Mach\nnumber of the system, providing an experimental method\nfor determination. The wakefield oscillation frequency\nwas also shown to depend on the charge and mass of the\ndust particles and this was used to provide a possible\nexperimental method for measuring the mass and charge\ndifference between them. An experiment was conducted\nemploying an external DC bias to create a perturbation\nbetween the particles in a two-particle chain and the data\nanalyzed based on a Fourier transformation method.\nAlthough this experiment did not show wakefield\noscillations, it did introduce a new technique for\ninvestigating the interaction forces between the dust\nparticles.\n\nVI.
