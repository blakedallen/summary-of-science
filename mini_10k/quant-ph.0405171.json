The present theoretical analysis is devoted to the\ncharacterization of the transition period from the state when the engine is started up to the\nsequence of states characterizing the periodic steady state termed the limit cycle. The process has similarities to the approach to thermodynamical equilibrium of an initially displaced\nstate. This relaxation to equilibrium is accompanied by entropy production signifying the\nirreversible character of the process. Entropy is produced in the approach to the limit cycle\nbut unlike an equilibrium state entropy continues to be produced also when the limit cycle\nis reached.\nThe approach to a limit cycle is based on the concept of a basin of attraction where the\nlimit cycle is located at its minimum. The basin of attraction is set by external and internal\nconstraints. Dissipative forces cause the system to settle down to the minimum of such\na basin. A first principle study requires to determine the equations of motion governing\nthe dynamics of the engine. For this task in the study, the framework of open quantum\nsystems is employed [1, 2]. The key point is that the dynamics of the engine is governed by\na completely positive map [3]. Then the limit cycle becomes a fixed point of this map. In\norder to determine if the approach to the limit cycle is monotonic, a measure of distance\nbetween the actual state of the engine and the final limiting cycle has to be defined. Such a\nmeasure of distance between two quantum states is not obvious due to the possibility that\nthe two states do not commute. In analogy to linear response theory it is expected that\nclose enough to the limit cycle all distance measures should show the same relaxation rate\ntoward the target limit cycle. This prediction is consistent with the results of the present\nstudy. Nevertheless at large distance from the limit cycle only the quantum measures show\na monotonic approach to it.\nThe present paper is a continuation of a series of studies on a four stroke quantum engine\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The models studied were based on a first principle quantum description of\nthe dynamics. The previous studies showed that the model engine displays the irreversible\ncharacteristics of common real heat engines operating in finite time. The performance of\nthe quantum engine was found to be limited by finite heat transfer. In addition quantum\nperformance limitations on the adiabatic branches mimicked very closely macroscopic friction\n2\n\n\fphenomena [7].\nThe quantum discrete heat engine is composed of a quantum working fluid, a hot and a\ncold bath and an external field which can alter the energy levels of the working medium. The\ncontrol parameters are the time allocations on the different branches, the total cycle time\nand the extreme values of the external field. All four branches are described by quantum\nequations of motion. The thermodynamical consequences can therefore be derived from\nfirst principles. A minimum set of three thermodynamical observables was found which\nwere sufficient to characterize the performance of the engine. With two additional variables,\nthe state of the working fluid could also be characterized [8]. Knowledge of the state is\nnecessary in order to evaluate the entropy and the internal temperature, variables which are\nnecessary to establish a thermodynamic perspective.\nThe intuitive notion is that the limit cycle is characterized by the external constraints\nand internal properties of the engine. The following questions arise naturally:\n\u2022 How do the control parameters characterize the approach to the limit cycle?\n\u2022 Can conditions be found for the non-existence of a limit cycle?\n\u2022 What are the irreversible properties of the limit cycle?\nThe present paper is devoted to the study of these issues in the context of quantum thermodynamics.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM THERMODYNAMICAL OBSERVABLES AND THEIR DYNAM-\n\nICS\n\nIn the field of quantum thermodynamics, thermodynamical variables are associated with\nquantum mechanical observables. An observable h\u00c2i, is defined as the following scalar\nproduct between the operator \u00c2 and the density operator \u03c1\u0302:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nh\u00c2i = \u00c2 * \u03c1\u0302 = tr{\u00c2\u2020 \u03c1\u0302} .\n\n(1)\n\nThe dynamics of the quantum thermodynamical observables are described by completely\npositive maps within the formulation of quantum open systems [1, 2]. The dynamics is\ngenerated by the Liouville super operator, which in the Heisenberg picture becomes:\n\u2202 \u00c2\n \u0307\n\u00c2 = L\u2217 (\u00c2) +\n\u2202t\n3\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere L is a generator of a completely positive map: T (t) = eLt . The generator L can be\ndecomposed to the unitary and dissipative contributions L\u2217 = L\u2217H + L\u2217D . The second term\nin Eq. (2)\n\n\u2202 \u00c2\n,\n\u2202t\n\naddresses a possible explicit time dependence of the operator.\n\nThe thermodynamical construction follows Gibbs by seeking a minimum set of variables\nassociated with the quantum orthogonal observables {B\u0302k }. This set should be sufficient to\ncompletely determine the state of the system \u03c1\u0302. In addition the set should be closed for\nthe dynamics i.e for the operation of L\u2217 . Any cycle of a heat engine can be decomposed\ninto a sequence of four completely positive maps defining the different branches. Eventually\nthis sequence closes upon itself. A thermodynamical description therefore means that the\nset of variables should be closed for the dynamics during all branches of the operation. In\nequilibrium statistical mechanics the energy of a subsystem is sufficient to determine its\nstate. In the present non-equilibrium example, additional variables hB\u0302k i are required to\ndefine the state of the working fluid. The set of time dependent expectation values ~b(t) are\nused to reconstruct the density operator:\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nX\n1\nbk B\u0302k\n\u00ce +\nN\nk\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2020\nwhere the expansion coefficients become bk = hB\u0302k i, B\u0302k * B\u0302j = tr{B\u0302k B\u0302j } = \u03b4kj , tr{B\u0302k } =\n0, and N is the size of the Hilbert space.\n\nA.\n\nQuantum entropy\n\nThermodynamic measures require the knowledge of the state of the system \u03c1\u0302. Entropy,\nthe most common measure, is associated with the lack of knowledge or dispersion of the\nsystem [9, 10]. The entropy associated with a measurement of an observable h\u00c2i with N\npossible outcomes becomes:\nS\u00c2 =\n\n\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\npj log pj ,\n\n(4)\n\nj\n\nwhere pj = tr{P\u0302j \u03c1\u0302} and P\u0302j is the j projection operator of the operator \u00c2 =\n\nPN\nj\n\n\u03b1j P\u0302j , and\n\nwhere the spectral decomposition (\u00c2|\u03c6j i = \u03b1j |\u03c6j i, P\u0302j = |\u03c6j ih\u03c6j |) was utilized. Looking\nfor the observable which complete measurement maximizes the information on the state, is\nequivalent to minimizing the entropy with respect to all possible observables. This process\n4\n\n\fleads to the von Neumann entropy\nS\n\n=\n\n\u2212 tr{\u03c1\u0302 log \u03c1\u0302} ,\n\n(5)\n\nand the optimum operator that minimizes dispersion commutes with the state \u03c1\u0302.\nThe distance from a reference state \u03c1\u0302ref is a key component in the study of the approach\nto the equilibrium or to the steady state. The conditional entropy is associated with the\nlack of information on the state \u03c1\u0302 subject to the knowledge of a reference state \u03c1\u0302ref . The\nconditional entropy associated with a measurement of a particular observable becomes:\nS\u00c2 (\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302ref ) =\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nj\n\npj log\n\npj\n,\nqj\n\n(6)\n\nwhere qj = tr{P\u0302j \u03c1\u0302ref }. The conditional entropy is bound from above and positive:\nS\u00c2 (\u03c1\u0302) \u2265 S\u00c2 (\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302ref ) . \u2265 0\n\n(7)\n\nThe value zero is reached only when \u03c1\u0302 = \u03c1\u0302ref .\nMaximizing Eq. (6) with respect to the operator \u00c2, leads to an entropy measure which\ndepends only on the two states:\nS(\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302ref ) =\n\n\u2212 tr{\u03c1\u0302(log \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 log \u03c1\u0302ref )} ,\n\n(8)\n\nS(\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302ref ) = 0 when the two states become indistinguishable.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for the monotonic approach to the limit cycle\n\nLindblad [11] has proven that the conditional entropy decreases if a completely positive\nmap is applied to both the state \u03c1\u0302 and the reference state \u03c1\u0302ref :\nS(\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302ref ) \u2265 S(T \u03c1\u0302|T \u03c1\u0302ref ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere T is a completely positive map. An interpretation of Eq. (9) is that a completely\npositive map reduces the distinguishability between two states. This observation has been\nemployed to prove the monotonic approach to equilibrium, provided that the reference state\n\u03c1\u0302ref is the only invariant of the mapping T i.e. T \u03c1\u0302ref = \u03c1\u0302ref [12, 13].\nThe same reasoning can prove the monotonic approach to the limit cycle. The mapping\nimposed by the cycle of operation of a heat engine is a product of the individual evolution\n5\n\n\fsteps along the branches composing the cycle of operation (Cf. IV C ). Each one of these\nevolution steps is a completely positive map, so that the total evolution Ucyc that represents\none cycle of operation, is also a completely positive map. If then a state \u03c1\u0302lc is found that\nis a single invariant of Ucyc i.e. Ucyc \u03c1\u0302lc = \u03c1\u0302lc then any initial state \u03c1\u0302init will monotonically\napproach to the limit cycle. Based on Eq. (9) a monotonic decreasing series bound from\nbelow converges to a limit.\nn\nS(\u03c1\u0302init |\u03c1\u0302lc ) \u2265 S(Ucyc \u03c1\u0302init |\u03c1\u0302lc ) \u2265 S(Ucyc\n\u03c1\u0302init |\u03c1\u0302lc ) \u2265 0 ,\n\n(10)\n\nn\nwhere Ucyc\nrepresents a sequential mapping of the cycle n times.\n\nThe largest eigenvalue of Ucyc with a value of one is associated with the invariant limit\ncycle state Ucyc \u03c1\u0302lc = 1\u03c1\u0302lc , the fixed point of Ucyc . The other eigenvalues determine the rate\nof approach to the limit cycle (Cf. Sec. V A)\nThe conditional entropy has been criticized as a measure of distance since it is not symmetric in \u03c1\u0302 and \u03c1\u0302ref and therefore does not form a metric. For this reason other measures\nhave been defined.\n\nC.\n\nThermodynamic Quantum Distance\n\nThe concept of statistical distance between different pure quantum systems was introduced by W. K. Wootters [14], who followed R. A. Fisher's [15] idea to measure distance in\nprobability space. In [16] the concept of distinguishability for neighboring mixed quantum\nstates is described. H\u00fcbner [17] computed explicitly the distance between two-dimensional\ndensity operators, and gave a general formula for the N dimensional distance. A detailed\nand clear review on the subject has been presented by Di\u00f3si and Salamon [18].\n\n1.\n\nWootters Distance\n\nStatistical distance is associated with the size of the statistical fluctuations occurring in a\nmeasurements that distinguishes one state from another. Two outcomes are distinguishable\nin a given number of trials, provided that the difference in actual probabilities is larger than\nthe size of typical fluctuation. The maximal number of distinguishable states that can be\nfound between two probability distributions has been suggested by Wootters [14] to define\nthe distance between these two states.\n6\n\n\fConsider two probability distributions p and q obtained from the same complete measurement of two quantum states \u03c1\u0302 and \u03c1\u0302ref (Cf. Eq. (6)). In order to define a distance\nbetween between p and q a continuous curve is sought connecting the two distributions.\nTaking advantage of normalization and that probabilities are positive, a change of variable\n\u221a\n\u221a\nis used: xj = pj and yj = q j . The new variables allow a geometric interpretation, they\nP 2 PN 2\ndefine points on an N dimensional unit sphere, since N\nj xj =\nj yj = 1. The statistical\ndistance between p and q then becomes the shortest distance on the surface of this unit\n\nsphere between the points defined by the vectors x and y. This shortest distance is equal\nto the angle between the unit vectors x and y, given by:\n!\n!\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\u221a \u221a\nD\u00c2 (p, q) = arccos\nxj yj\n= arccos\npj qj\nj=1\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nj=1\n\nFor quantum systems Eq. (11) corresponds to the statistical distance associated with a\nmeasurement of an operator \u00c2. For two commuting states the statistical distance becomes\nthe arccos of scalar product of the square roots of the density operators.\no\u0011\n\u0010 n\n1/2 1/2\n.\nD(\u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u0302ref ) = arccos tr \u03c1\u0302 \u03c1\u0302ref\n\nFor two non-commuting states, the distance D(\u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u0302ref ) has to be redefined as [17]:\nq\nD(\u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u0302ref ) = inf (tr{(\u01741 \u2212 \u01742 )(\u01741 \u2212 \u01742 )\u2217 } ,\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all Hilbert-Schmidt operators describing all the possible\noperators which fulfill\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u01741 \u01741 = \u03c1\u0302, \u01742 \u01742 = \u03c1\u0302ref ,\n\n(14)\n\n\u2217\n\nand \u01741 \u01742 > 0. This definition of distance is symmetric in \u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u0302ref and therefore can form\na metric [17, 18]:\nD(\u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u0302ref ) =\n\ns\n\nN\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 tr\n\nq\n\n1\n2\n\n(\u03c1\u0302) \u03c1\u0302ref (\u03c1\u0302)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere N is the size of the Hilbert space.\n\nD.\n\nEntropy production\n\nOnce the limit cycle is reached any observable is cyclic including the entropy. This is the\nresult of the fact that the state of the system is completely determined by a finite number of\n7\n\n\fexpectation values which are cyclic. This means that entropy change in the complete cycle\nis zero or the total internal entropy production of the working medium is zero.\nThe external entropy production is positive for the limit cycle. It is a measure of the\nirreversible dissipation to the hot and cold baths:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQh Qc\next\n,\n+\n\u2206Scyl = \u2212\nTh\nTc\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Qh/c is the heat dissipated to the hot/cold bath and Th/c is the bath temperature.\nIII.\n\nTHE QUANTUM MODEL\n\nThe present study is based on a four stroke quantum heat engine model corresponding\nto the Otto cycle. The cycle is composed of two isochores where the working medium is in\ncontact with the hot/cold baths and the external field is constant and two adiabats where\nthe external field is varying. The motion is generated by the Liouville operator L which can\nbe decomposed to a Hamiltonian part and a dissipative part:\nL\u2217 = L\u2217H + L\u2217D ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere L\u2217H \u00c2 = i[\u0124, \u00c2]. The main feature of the Hamiltonian is that the external control\npart does not commute with the inertial internal part.\n\u0124 = \u0124int + \u0124ext (t) ,\n\n(18)\n\nand [\u0124int , \u0124ext ] 6= 0.\nThe specific choice of working medium is composed of an ensemble of noninteracting\ncoupled two-spin systems identical to the model studied in Ref. [8].\n\nA.\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nThe single particle Hamiltonian is chosen to be proportional to the polarization of a twolevel-system (TLS): \u03c3\u0302 jz . The operators \u03c3\u0302 z , \u03c3\u0302x , \u03c3\u0302 y are the Pauli matrices. For this system,\nthe external Hamiltonian will be:\n\u0124ext = 2\n\n\u22123/2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\u03c9(t) \u03c3\u0302 z \u2297 \u00ce + \u00ce \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2261 \u03c9(t)B\u03021 ,\n8\n\n(19)\n\n\fand the external control field \u03c9(t) is chosen to be in the z direction. The uncontrolled\ninteraction Hamiltonian is chosen to be restricted to the coupling of pairs of spin atoms.\nTherefore the working fluid consists of noninteracting pairs of TLS's. For simplicity, a single\npair can be considered. The thermodynamics of M pairs then follows by introducing a trivial\nscale factor. Accordingly let the uncontrolled part be:\n\u0124int = 2\u22123/2 J \u03c3\u0302 1x \u2297 \u03c3\u0302 2x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302 1y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302 2y\n\n\u0001\n. \u2261 J B\u03022 .\n\n(20)\n\nJ scales the strength of the interaction. When J \u2192 0, the model represents a working\nmedium with noninteracting atoms [5].\nThe commutation relation: [B\u03021 , B\u03022 ] =\n\n\u221a\n\n2iB\u03023 leads to the definition of B\u03023 . The analysis\n\nshows [8], that the set of operators B\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 and \u00ce forms a closed sub-algebra of the total\nLie algebra of the combined system. The Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the operators\nB\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 in the polarization representation becomes:\n\u0124\nThe eigenvalues of \u0124 are 0 , \u00b1\n\n\u03a9\n\u221a\n2\n\n=\n\n(21)\n\u03c9(t)B\u03021 + JB\u03022 .\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a9 = \u03c9 2 + J 2 . The closed Lie algebra of the set\n\n{B\u0302k } means that it is also closed for the propagation generated by the Hamiltonian (21).\nIV.\n\nTHE CYCLE OF OPERATION, THE QUANTUM OTTO CYCLE\n\nThe operation of the heat engine is determined by the properties of the working medium\nand the coupling to the hot and cold baths. The cycle of operation is defined by the\nexternal controls which include the variation in time of the field with the periodic property\n\u03c9(t) = \u03c9(t + \u03c4 ) where \u03c4 is the total cycle time synchronized with the contact times on\nthe different branches of the cycle. The cycle studied is composed of two branches where\nthe working medium is in contact with the hot/cold baths and the field is constant, termed\nisochores. In addition, there are two branches where the field \u03c9(t) varies and the working\nmedium is disconnected from the baths termed adiabats. This cycle is a quantum analogue\nof the Otto cycle. The four strokes of the cycle with the corresponding parameters are (Cf.\nFig. 1):\n1. Isochore A \u2192 B: the field is maintained constant \u03c9 = \u03c9b while the working medium\nis in contact with the hot bath of temperature Th with heat conductance \u0393h , and\ndephasing parameter \u03b3h for a period of \u03c4h .\n9\n\n\f\u03c9a\n\n\u03c9b\n\n1.2\n\n.B\n\n\u03c4c\n0.8\n\nD.\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nF.\n4\n\nSh\n\n\u03c4h\n\nSE\n\n\u03c4ba\n\nC.\n\n1\n\nTh E\n.\n\n.A\n\n\u03c4ab\n\nSc\n\nTc\n6\n\n8\n\n\u03c9\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFIG. 1: The cycle of the heat engine in the (\u03c9, SE ) plane. The upper red line indicates the\nenergy entropy of the working medium in equilibrium with the hot bath at temperature Th for\ndifferent values of the field. The blue line below indicates the energy entropy in equilibrium\nwith the cold bath at temperature Tc . The cycle in green has an infinite time allocation on all\nbranches. It reaches the equilibrium point with the hot bath (point E) and equilibrium point\nwith the cold bath (point F). The inner cycle ABCD is a typical cycle with the time allocations:\n\u03c4h = 2.5 \u03c4ba = 0.01, \u03c4c = 3. \u03c4ab = 0.01. The external parameters are: \u03c9a = 5.08364, \u03c9b =\n12.6355, J = 2., Th = 7.5, Tc = 1.5, \u0393h = \u0393c = 0.3423, \u03b3h = \u03b3c = 0\n\n2. Adiabat B \u2192 C: The field changes linearly from \u03c9b to \u03c9a in a time period of \u03c4ba .\n3. Isochore C \u2192 D: the field is maintained constant \u03c9 = \u03c9a the working medium is in\ncontact with the cold bath of temperature Tc with heat conductance \u0393c , and dephasing\nparameter \u03b3c for a period of \u03c4c .\n4. Adiabat D \u2192 A: The field changes linearly from \u03c9a to \u03c9b in a time period of \u03c4ab .\nFig. 1 displays a typical trajectory of the cycle in the plane defined by the external field\nand the entropy (\u03c9, SE ).\nThe state \u03c1\u0302 (Cf. Eq. (3)) of the working medium is completely reconstructed by the set\n{B\u0302k } , k = 1, 5 of five operators [8]. The set of the three operators B\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 is sufficient\nto describe the energy changes during the cycle of operation. The map U relates the initial\n10\n\n\fvalues of these operators to their final values for each of the engine branches. Implicitly this\nmap is obtainable by solving a set of coupled inhomogeneous equations of motion for each\nbranch [8]. An explicit description of the map is obtained by adding the identity operator\n\u00ce which transforms the inhomogeneous equations to a closed set of linear coupled 4 \u00d7 4\nequations. The equation of motion of the two additional operators B\u03024 and B\u03025 form a linear\nfirst order inhomogeneous equation depending on the time dependence of the closed set\nB\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 and \u00ce. As a result they form an additional 2 \u00d7 2 block in the map.\nA.\n\nPropagators on the isochores\n\nThe dynamical map U(\u03c4c/h ) on the isochores is generated by both the Hamiltonian and\nthe dissipative Lindblad generators representing the interaction with the bath. The 4 \u00d7 4\nblock of the map is first solved for the set B\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 and \u00ce. Since \u03c9 is constant on the\nisochores a closed form of the propagator U(\u03c4c/h ) is obtained [8]:\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n\nK X\u03c9 \u03a9+cJ\n2\n\n2\n\nK \u03c9J(X\u2212c)\n\u03a92\n\n\u2212\u0393\u03c4c/h\nK Js\nbeq\n)\n1 (1 \u2212 e\n\u03a9\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec K \u03c9J(X\u2212c) K XJ 2 +c\u03c92 \u2212K \u03c9s beq (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393\u03c4c/h ) \uf8f7\n2\n2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\uf8f7\nU(\u03c4c/h ) = \uf8ec\n\u03c9s\n\uf8ec \u2212K Js\n\uf8f7\nK\nKc\n0\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\n\u221a\nwhere K = exp{\u2212(\u0393 + 2\u03b3\u03a92 )\u03c4c/h }, X = exp(2\u03b3\u03a92 \u03c4c/h ), c = cos( 2\u03a9\u03c4c/h ) and s =\n\u221a\neq\n\u221a\u03c9\n\u221aJ\nsin( 2\u03a9\u03c4c/h ), beq\n1 = \u2212 2\u03a9\u0393 (k \u2191 \u2212k \u2193), b2 = \u2212 2\u03a9\u0393 (k \u2191 \u2212k \u2193). Finally \u03b3 is the dephasing constant, \u03c4c/h is the time spent on the cold/hot isochore , and \u0393 = k \u2191 +k \u2193 is the\nheat-conductance to the bath. The corresponding bath temperature Tc/h , enters through\nthe detailed balance relation:\n\nk\u2191\nk\u2193\n\n\u2212\n\n= e\n\nT\n\n\u03a9\n\u221a\n\n2\n\n. The block containing B\u03024 and B\u03025 can now be\n\nsolved as a 2 \u00d7 2 set of coupled inhomogeneous equation of motion [8].\nB.\n\nPropagators on the adiabats\n\nThe propagator on the adiabats is more involved. This is due to the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian. Using the Lie algebra of the set of {B\u0302k } operators it is always\npossible [19] to describe the propagator as:\n\u2020\n\n\u00c2(t) = \u00db\u00c2\u00db\n11\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere \u00db = exp(i\u03b11 (t)B\u03021 ) exp(i\u03b12 (t)B\u03022 ) exp(i\u03b13 (t)B\u03023 ) and the coefficients \u03b1i (t) include the\neffect of time ordering. The procedure is described in Appendix A. This approach leads to\nthe explicit result for the propagator of the set B\u03021 , B\u03022 , B\u03023 , \u00ce:\n\nUa (t) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\nc2 c3 \u2212s3 c1 + c3 s2 s1 c3 s2 c1 + s3 s1 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ecc s c c +s s s s s c \u2212c s 0\uf8f7\n2\n3\n3\n1\n3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n1\n3\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212s2\n\uf8f7\nc\ns\nc\nc\n0\n2 1\n2 1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere: s1 = sin(\u03b11 ), s2 = sin(\u03b12 ), s3 = sin(\u03b13 ), c1 = cos(\u03b11 ), c2 = cos(\u03b12 ), c3 = cos(\u03b13 ).\nThe coefficients \u03b1 can be integrated either numerically Cf. Eq. (A5) or closed form solutions\nare obtained for specific functional forms of \u03c9(t) [8]. The operators B\u03024 and B\u03025 commute\nwith the Hamiltonian, and therefore are constant on the adiabats .\n\nC.\n\nThe global propagator\n\nThe propagator of the cycle represents the completely positive map of the initial expectation values to the final ones after the operation of one cycle. The propagator is then\nconstructed as a sequential product of the individual propagators on the different branches:\nUcyc = Uab Uisc Uba Uish .\n\n(25)\n\nAn analytic form has been obtained for the propagators on the isochores (Eq. (22)). For\nthe adiabats the form of Eq. (24) has been used which is parametrically dependent on the\n\u03b1 parameters.\nTable I summarizes all the control parameters defining the cycle.\nThe global map enable to solve for the operator expectation values from their initial\nvalues.

The reference state \u03c1\u0302lc can be chosen on any point on\nthe engine's trajectory, on points A B C D for example or between them. The same\npoint on the trajectory is used to define the state in the n'th iteration \u03c1\u0302n . It was found that\nthe distances are invariant to the choice of the chosen point on the cycle's trajectory.\nExplicitly the quantum distance , D(\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc ), Eq.

Additional\ncomputational details are given in Appendix B 2.\nThe distance to the limit cycle can also be associated with the conditional entropy:\nS(\u03c1\u0302 |\u03c1\u0302 ) = S(\u03c1\u0302n )\u2212\n\u0010 n lc\u221a\n} log(\u03bb1 (lc)) + \u03bb2 (n) log(\u03bb2 (lc)) + \u03bb3 (n) log(\u03bb3 (lc)) + {rn +\n{rn \u2212 D2q\nlc\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\n2q\n} log(\u03bb1 (lc))\nDlc\n\n,\n(31)\n\nwhich becomes zero when \u03c1\u0302n approaches the limit cycle.\nIn all cases studied the quantum distance D(\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc ) monotonically approaches zero with\nthe increase in the number n of accumulated cycles, Cf.

Four example are shown numbered from 1 to 4. The corresponding\ninserts show the limit cycle in the energy entropy SE and \u03c9 plane. The dashed lines indicated by\nE correspond to the energy distance DE (\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc ). Cycles 1 and 3 are without dephasing. Cycle 2\nand 4 include dephasing on the isochores with \u03b3h = 0.01 and \u03b3c = 0.03. All cycles spend the same\ntime on the isochores (\u03c4h = \u03c4c = 0.6). The time on the adiabats varies form very short, cycles 1\nand 2, to very long, cycles 3 and 4.\n\ntrue for the conditional entropy as predicted by Eq. (10). The energy distance DE (\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc )\nas in case 1E in Fig. 3, shows a non-monotonic periodic oscillations in the approach to the\nlimit cycle. With sufficient dephasing the density operator is almost diagonal in the energy\nrepresentation therefore the two distances converge; D(\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc ) = DE (\u03c1\u0302n , \u03c1\u0302lc ) Cf. cases 2\nand 4 in Fig. 3.\nExamining the measures of approach to the limit cycle Eq. (28) and (31), it is found\nthat they have similar functional dependence on the expectation values of the set of {B\u0302}\noperators. In particular the two functionals contain the scalar product q. This indicates\n16\n\n\fthat all quantum convex functionals of \u03c1\u0302 will relax to the limit cycle in the same rate.\nThe dynamics of the set of operators {B\u0302} is determined by the eigenvalues of the Global\nOperator , Ucyc , Eq. (25). The eigenvector with the eigenvalue of \u03bc0 = 1 represents the\nexpectation values of the limit cycle. The decay rate to the limit cycle depends on the\neigenvalues which are smaller than one. The eigenvalue \u03bc1 \u2264 1 was found to be real and\nas expected its eigenvector does not include a component of the identity operator. Fig. 4\nshows the dependence of the eigenvalues \u03bc of the Global Operator on the time spent on the\nisochores and the coupling constants. The relationship is well fitted by \u03bc1 = e\u2212(\u0393h \u03c4h +\u0393c \u03c4c ) .\nThis means that a very weak dependence on the dephasing rate \u03b3h/c was found. \u03bc1 can\nthen be interpreted as the relaxation rate per cycle in the direction defined by the limit\ncycle vector. The eigenvalues \u03bc2/3 = |\u03bc2 |e\u00b1i\u03c6 are complex. Their amplitude can be fitted\n2\n2\nto |\u03bc2/3 | = e\u2212((\u0393h +\u03b3h \u03a9h )\u03c4h +(\u0393c +\u03b3c \u03a9c )\u03c4c ) . This suggests that \u03bc2/3 represents the rate of decay\nin a direction perpendicular to the direction of limit cycle vector. The phase \u03c6 of \u03bc2/3 is\nan accumulated phase and was found to be linearly related to the time allocated on the\nadiabats. The last two eigenvalues associated with the block of B\u03024 and B\u03025 become \u03bc4 = \u03bc1\nand \u03bc5 = (\u03bc1 )2 ( Eq. (57) and (59) of [8] ).\nThe analysis reveals that the rate of approach to the limit cycle is determined by the\naccumulated dissipation on the the hot and cold isochores. The eigenvalue \u03bc1 plays the role\nof the longitudinal relaxation analogue to 1/T1 , while the eigenvalues \u03bc2/3 play the role of\nthe transverse relaxation or 1/T2 .\n\nB.\n\nProperties of the limit cycle\n\nThe fact that the limit cycle is closed imposes a strict periodic constraint on all properties\nof the working medium. The periodicity of the energy entropy and the von Neumann entropy\nare a key to the understanding of the cycle performance.\n\n1.\n\nMinimal cycle time\n\nA limit cycle can only exist if the total internal entropy changes on the four branches\nsums up to zero.

Notice the horizontal line representing the von Neumann\nentropy. Other parameters are: J = 2, Th = 7.5, Tc = 1.5, \u03c9a = 5.0836387, \u03c9b = 12.635485,\n\u0393c = 1.7. The entropy production of the cycle is: \u2206S u = 1.889 * 10\u22122 and the power output is\nnegative P = \u22124.293 * 10\u22122 .\n\nconditions where a limit cycle cannot be closed. As was described in Sec. II B a limit cycle\nis obtained only when there is a single invariant of the propagator Ucyl . An extreme case is\nwhen no time is allocated to the hot and cold isochores (\u03c4c = \u03c4h = 0). By construction the\nmap Ucyl is unitary and all eigenvalues are modulus 1. Thus any initial state will oscillate\nindefinitely without settling to a limit cycle. The next step in the investigation is to allocate\nsome time to the cold isochore \u03c4c 6= 0 adding a dissipative branch. Analyzing the eigenvalues\nof Ucyl shows the expected invariant eigenvalue \u03bc0 = 1. All other eigenvalues are smaller\nthan one meaning that a limit cycle exists. The entropy picture is more surprising. The\nchange in the von Neumann entropy \u2206S ab/ba on the two adiabats is zero (Cf. Fig. 5) for\nany point on the cycle trajectory. Therefore the only way the cycle can be closed is that\n19\n\n\fthe change of the von Neumann entropy on the dissipative cold isochore is also zero. A\ncomplementary picture is obtained by analyzing the energy entropy SE along the trajectory.\nIf the two adiabats are not an inverse of each other, then the evolution after a sequence of\ntwo adiabats (point D \u2192 AB \u2192 C ) will lead to an increase in SE (Cf. Fig. 5). To close\nthe cycle this increase should be compensated by a decrease in the energy entropy on the\ncold isochore. How do these seemingly contradictory entropy balances coexist? The answer\nis hidden in the double role the cold bath plays in the entropy changes. If the state of the\nworking medium (point C in Fig. 5) is hotter than the temperature of the cold bath, heat\nwill transfer from the working medium to the cold bath , and thus decreasing the liquid's\nentropy. On the other hand the contact with the bath forces dephasing. This loss of phase\nincreases the von Neumann entropy. Therefore, there is a point on the cold isochore where\nthe decrease in the energy entropy is exactly compensated by the entropy increase due to\ndephasing. This scenario defines the stable limit cycle. This cycle cannot produce useful\nwork. It represents a device which converts work from the two adiabats to heat dissipated\nin the cold bath in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.\nFig. 6 shows three cycles with time allocated to all branches of the engine. The first\ncycle, \"1\" is an extension of cycle of Fig. 5. It has minimal contact with the hot bath. The\nposition of the limit cycle on the (\u03c9, SE ) plot is as far as possible from the cold equilibrium\npoint. This position maximizes the negative energy entropy change on the cold isochore.\nCycle \"2\" corresponds to a zero work cycle. The work generated by extracting heat from\nthe hot bath and ejecting at the cold bath is balanced by the work against \"friction\". This\ncycle defines the minimum operational cycle time. Cycle \"3\" is a typical cycle with positive\nwork output.\nA search was carried out for time allocations where the cycle does not close, therefore no\nlimit cycle exist. In general it was very difficult to find such conditions. These atypical cases\nwith extremely small time allocations, were characterized by a non uniqueness of the limit\ncycle. For slightly longer time allocations a unique limit cycle was found which does not\nrepresent an engine. The reason is that the cooling on the cold isochore was not sufficient\nto dissipate the energy increase on the adiabats. As a result additional cooling was required\non the hot isochore. The onset where heat is transfered by the engine from the hot to the\ncold bath was termed in the analogous engine based on a phenomenological description of\nfriction [6], as the minimal cycle time (Cf. Cycle \"1\" in fig. 6).

Cycle \"2\" in fig. 6).\n\n2.\n\nEntropy Production\n\nThe position of the limit cycle is determined by the balance of entropy. Since on the\nadiabatic branches the von Neumann entropy is constant the increase in the entropy of the\nworking medium on the hot isochore should be exactly compensated on the cold isochore.\nExamining the entropy changes on the hot isochore, one can compare the external entropy\nproduction \u2206Shext = \u2212Qh /Th to the internal change. Schl\u00f6gl suggested [20, 21], that the\ninternal entropy production is related to the difference in the conditional entropy associated\n\n21\n\n\fwith the equilibrium state:\n\u2206ShE\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= SE \u03c1\u0302A |\u03c1\u0302eq (Th ) \u2212 SE \u03c1\u0302B |\u03c1\u0302eq (Th ) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302A is the state at point A on the beginning of the hot isochore, \u03c1\u0302B is the state at\npoint B at the end of the hot isochore and \u03c1\u0302eq (Th ) is the equilibrium state at point E. Using\nthe fact that the equilibrium density operator is diagonal in the energy representation i.e.\n\u0001\nSE \u03c1\u0302A |\u03c1\u0302eq (Th ) = SE (\u03c1\u0302A ) \u2212 EA /Th + log Z, Eq. (32) takes the form:\n\u2206ShE\n\n= SE (\u03c1\u0302A ) \u2212 SE (\u03c1\u0302B ) \u2212\n\nQh\nTh\n\n(33)\n\nsince Qh = (Eb \u2212 Ea ).\nThe full quantum characteristics representing the deviation of the density operator from\nthe energy representation are obtained by the conditional entropy:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2206Shu = S \u03c1\u0302A |\u03c1\u0302eq (Th ) \u2212 S \u03c1\u0302B |\u03c1\u0302eq (Th )\n\n= S (\u03c1\u0302A ) \u2212 S (\u03c1\u0302B ) \u2212\n\nQh\n.\nTh\n\n(34)\n\nFor very long cycle times and sufficient time allocation on the isochores the system is\ndiagonal in the energy representation. As a result Eq. (34) and Eq. (32) are equivalent. The\ndifference between the internal entropy production \u2206Shu and the external \u2206Shext = \u2212Qh /Th\nrepresents the entropy increase in the working medium.

The invariant has an eigenvalue \u03bc0 = 1 and its eigenvector is expressed via the\nexpectation values of B\u03021 , B\u03022 B\u03023 and \u00ce in the limit cycle.\nQuantum measures were developed to characterize the approach to the limit cycle: the\nconditional entropy and the quantum distance. These measures show a monotonic approach\nto the limit cycle. The projected measures such as the energy distance or energy conditional\nentropy can show an oscillatory approach to the limit cycle. Close to the limit cycle the rate\nof approach of all measures converge to the same value. The quantum distance was always\nlarger than the probability distance associated with the measurement of energy. Dephasing\neroded the deviation between the two distances.\nLongitudinal and a transverse modes of approach to the limit cycle could be identified.\nThe rate of approach is associated to the eigenvalues of the propagator. The eigenvalue \u03bc1\ndetermines the longitudinal relaxation rate. \u03bc1 exponentially depends on the accumulated\nenergy relaxation on the hot and cold isochores \u03bc1 \u221d e\u2212(\u0393h \u03c4h +\u0393c \u03c4c ) . The transverse rate of\napproach is associated with the eigenvalues \u03bc2/3 . Their magnitude depends on the accumu2\n2\nlated dephasing on the hot and cold isochores |\u03bc | \u221d e\u2212((\u0393h +\u03b3h \u03a9h )\u03c4h +(\u0393c +\u03b3c \u03a9c )\u03c4c ) . The phase\n2/3\n\n\u03c6 of \u03bc2/3 is linear in the time allocation \u03c4ab + \u03c4ba . The dependence of the rate of relaxation\non other parameters such as J was found to be weak.\n\nB.\n\nCan conditions be found for non-existence of the limit cycle?\n\nWhen no time is allocated to the hot and cold isochores \u03c4h = \u03c4c = 0 then the evolution\nis unitary and the modulus of all eigenvalues of the propagator become 1. As a result\nno unique limit cycle can be found. For very short times allocated to the isochores, two\neigenvalues of the cycle propagator became equal to one, again no limit cycle is obtained in\nthese conditions. Therefore there exist a \u03b4\u03c4 \u226a 1 range of time allocation on the isochores\nfor which no unique limit cycle can be closed.\n\n23\n\n\fC.\n\nWhat are the irreversible properties of the limit cycle?\n\nHeat transport between the working medium and the baths is a common source of irreversibility for all realistic heat engines. If this is the only source of entropy generation the\nengine is classified as endoreversible [22, 23], meaning that entropy is only generated on the\ninterface and that the internal operation is reversible. The dissipative forces accompanying\nheat transfer were found to be sufficient to drive a quantum two-level endoreversible heat\nengine to a limit cycle [5].\nFriction is an additional source of irreversibility for all realistic heat engines, characterized\nby an internal entropy production. The heat generated by friction eventually has to be\ndisposed in the cold bath. The performance of the present first principle quantum engine\nhas been shown to be limited by a friction like phenomena [6]. The key to the understanding\nof the quantum origin of friction lies in the difference between the energy entropy SE and\nthe von Neumann entropy S. Since the von Neumann entropy is constant on the adiabats\none could classify the model as endoreversible (Cf. Eq. (35)). Following the engines cycle\nby observing its energy changes shows characteristics of entropy generation on the adiabats\n(Cf. Eq. (36)).\nThe most illuminating case which characterizes the irreversible character due to the\nnonadiabatic dynamics is a cycle composed of two adiabats and only a cold isochore as\ndisplayed in Fig. 5. External work is converted to internal heat which is dissipated to\nthe cold bath. The only phenomena that fits this behavior is friction. Surprisingly, the\nvon Neumann entropy for the complete cycle trajectory is constant. This is in contrast\nto a power producing cycle where the von Neumann entropy changes on the isochores. A\ndetailed analysis of the von Neumann entropy change on the cold isochore performed in the\nenergy representation unravel the picture. A decrease in the entropy of diagonal elements,\nequivalent to \u2206SE due to cooling of the working medium is exactly compensated by an\nentropy increase due to dephasing i.e. loss of the nondiagonal elements. It seems therefore\nthat friction is the result of the interplay between the unitary evolution on the adiabats\nand the dissipative dynamics on the cold isochore. Friction is found only when the state\nof the quantum engine deviates from a diagonal energy representation. Such dynamics are\na consequence of the nonadiabatic operation conditions caused by the noncommutability\nof the working medium Hamiltonian at different points along the cycle trajectory. These\n24\n\n\fobservations are the basis for a quantum control of friction which will be presented in a\nfuture study.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Lajos Di\u00f3si and Jeffrey Gordon many discussions and a critical reading.

The unitary evolution operator \u00db(t) for an explicitly time\ndependent Hamiltonians is obtained from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u2212i\n\nd\n\u00db(t) = \u0124(t)\u00db(t),\ndt\n\n\u00db(0) = \u00ce .\n\n(A1)\n\nThe propagated set of operators becomes:\n~\n~\n~\nB\u0302(t) = \u00db(t)B\u0302(0)\u00db\u2020 (t) = Ua (t)B\u0302(0) ,\n\n(A2)\n\nand is related to the super-evolution operator Ua (t). Based on the group structure Wei and\nNorman, [19] constructed a solution to Eq.
