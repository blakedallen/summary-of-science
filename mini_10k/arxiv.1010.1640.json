In the ten-dimensional bulk, the anomalies of N = 1 superstrings are successfully cancelled by the use of the well-known Green-Schwarz mechanism [1], in which the\ntwo-form B field is assumed to change with respect to the gauge and local Lorentz transformations. Anomalies of chiral matter fields supported on some branes are also known to\ncancel with inflow contributions from the bulk [2]. In this letter, we focus on the gauge,\ngravitational (tangent-bundle) and their mixed anomalies arising from the localized modes\nnear a 5-brane in the SO(32) heterotic string theory. We show that their anomalies also\ncancel with the anomaly inflow from the bulk with the use of the Green-Schwarz mechanism\non the brane, similarly [3] to the case of the E8 \u00d7 E8 5-brane. Although the argument that\nthe anomalies on a heterotic 5-brane should cancel with an anomaly inflow is an old one\n[4], the arithmetic we show below is new and different from [4], as, for instance, we do not\nconsider any \"current at infinity\". We also compare our result with Mourad's analysis [5] in\nwhich the small-instanton limit was considered. Anomaly cancellation on heterotic 5-branes\nin the K3 compactification was discussed in [6].\nLet us start with the symmetric 5-brane solution [7, 8] in the SO(32) heterotic string\ntheory. It has been known for some time that the moduli of this solution consists of D =\n6, N = 1 30 hypermultiplets [9]. The bosonic moduli are four Nambu-Goldstone modes\nassociated with the spontaneously broken translational invariance, one scale modulus and\n115 moduli coming from the arbitrariness of the choice of SU(2) subgroup of SO(32) in\nwhich the spin connection is embedded. The number of 115 can be easily counted by the\ndecomposition of SO(32) in terms of SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) as follows:\n496 = (378, 1, 1) \u2297 (1, 3, 1) \u2297 (1, 1, 3) \u2297 (28, 2, 2).\n\n(1)\n\nSuppose that the SU(2) spin connection is embedded into the last SU(2) subgroup. Then\nthe centralizer SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2) remains as the unbroken gauge group, while the rest of\n3 + 28 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 115 generators give rise to deformations, being moduli of this solution.\nThus, 28 of the 30 hypermultiplets, which contain 56 symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors,\ntransform as (28, 2) with respect to the unbroken SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2) gauge symmetry, while\nthe remaining two are gauge singlets. Anomaly polynomials for the chiral fermions belonging\n\n1\n\n\fto these hypermultiples are:\n(28,2)\n\nI8\n\nI8singlet\n\n1\n\u00c2(T \u03a3) * tr(28,2) eiF\n2\n8\n1\n1\n28\n(\u22124p2 + 7p21 ) + p1 tr(28,2) F 2 + tr(28,2) F 4 ,\n=\n5760\n96\n48\n1\n=\n\u00c2(T \u03a3) \u00d7 4\n2\n8\n2\n(\u22124p2 + 7p21 ),\n=\n5760\n=\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u00c2(T \u03a3) is the Dirac genus of the tangent bundle of the 5-brane and F is the 2-form\nfor the SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2) gauge field strength. Similarly to [3], we have ignored the normal\nbundle anomalies in (2) and (3). The total anomaly I61 is obtained by the well-known descent\nrelations:\n(28,2)\n\nI8 = I8\n\n+ I8singlet ,\n\n(4)\n\nI8 = dI7 ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b4I7 = dI6 .\n\n(6)\n\nOn the other hand, the bulk supergravity action contains the Green-Schwarz counterterm\nproportional to BX8 with\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\n2 2\n2\n2\n4\n2\n2\nX8 =\ntrR + (trR ) \u2212\ntrR TrFSO(32) + TrFSO(32) \u2212\n(TrFSO(32) ) ,\n24 8\n32\n240\n24\n7200\n(7)\nwhere FSO(32) is the 2-form for the SO(32) gauge field strength and Tr is the trace in the\nadjoint 496 representation. R is the curvature 2-form for the ten-dimensional bulk tangent\nbundle Q, which is decomposed, in the presence of the 5-brane, into a direct sum of the\ntangent bundle of the brane, T \u03a3, and the normal bundle N of it. A Pontryagin class of Q\ncan be expressed as a polynomial of Pontryagin classes of T \u03a3 and N. However, since we\nhave taken only the tangent bundle anomalies into account in (2) and (3), we may identify\nthe curvature 2-form R for the total bundle Q to be the curvature 2-form for the tangent\nbundle T \u03a3 of the brane, and examine the cancellation of the tangent bundle anomalies, as\nwell as the gauge anomalies, and the mixed ones for the gauge and tangent bundles. In the\nend of this note, we also comment on the normal bundle anomaly cancellation in the present\nsetting. With these remarks we write X8 in terms of traces of the subgroup SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\nX8 =\n3p1 \u2212 4p2 + 2p1 (tr28 FSO(28) + 2tr2 FSU (2) ) + 8(tr28 FSO(28) + 2tr2 FSU (2) ) ,\n192\n(8)\n2\n\n\fwhere p1 and p2 are now understood as the Pontryagin classes for T \u03a3.\nThe gauge and local Lorentz variations of the B field in the BX8 \u223c \u2212dBX7 term precisely\ncancel the ten-dimensional bulk anomalies in the SO(32) string theory; this is the GreenSchwarz mechanism. On the other hand, if there is no brane, the variations of X7 vanishes\nbecause d2 B = 0. However, since the 5-brane is a magnetic source for the B field, the\nvariations of X7 give rise to, in the presence of the 5-brane, \u03b4-function-like contributions\non the 5-brane known as anomaly inflows. Therefore, the total anomalies are described by\n(28,2)\nthe invariant polynomial I8\n+ I8singlet \u2212 X8 , which turns out, using (2), (3) and (8), to\nfactorize as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n(28,2)\nsinglet\n2\n2\n2\nI8\n+ I8\n\u2212 X8 = \u2212\ntrR \u2212 tr32 FSO(32)\np1 + 12tr2 FSU (2) .\n(9)\n96\n2\n2\nHere we have reexpressed tr28 FSO(28)\n+ 2tr2 FSU\n(2) as the SO(32) fundamental trace in the\nfirst parentheses. The first factor is precisely the combination that appears in the anomalous\nBianchi identity of the H field, and therefore the sum of anomalies can be cancelled by\nintroducing a local counterterm on the 5-brane, similarly to the cases of the type I [5] and\nE8 \u00d7 E8 [3] 5-branes.\n\nLet us compare the arithmetic we presented above with the known mechanism of anomaly\ncancellation on the SO(32) 5-brane in the small-instanton limit [5]. If the instanton size of\nthe heterotic 5-brane tends to zero, the theory becomes strongly coupled and the supergravity\nanalysis loses its validity. It was proposed that there would then be an enhanced Sp(k) gauge\nsymmetry [10] on k parallel 5-branes in this limit of the SO(32) theory, in addition to the full\nSO(32) gauge symmetry. This argument was supported by the proof of anomaly cancellation\nin the S-dual type I brane system [5]: The dual type I D5-branes have three kinds of zeromode\nhypermultiplets, called \u03b8, \u03bb and \u03c8 in [5]; they transform as (4+ , 2+ , 1, 1), (4\u2212 , 2\u2212 , 1, 3) and\n(4+ , 1, 32, 2), respectively, under the actions of SO(5, 1) \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 SO(32) \u00d7 SU(2), where\nthe first two factors are the ten-dimensional Lorentz group, while the last SU(2) = Sp(1) is\nthe enhanced gauge symmetry. The subscripts \u00b1 denote the chiralities of the spinors.\nLet I8\u03b8 , I8\u03bb and I8\u03c8 be the anomaly polynomials of \u03b8, \u03bb and \u03c8, respectively. If k = 1, the\ntotal anomaly turns out to be [5]\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03c8\n\u03b8\n\u03bb\n2\n2\n2\nI8 + I8 + I8 \u2212 X 8 = \u2212\ntrR \u2212 tr32 FSO(32) + 4\u03c7(N)\np1 (Q) + 12tr2 FSU (2) \u2212 2p1 (N) ,(10)\n96\nwhere \u03c7(N) is Euler class of the normal bundle.\nIf all the terms depending on the normal-bundle connections are ignored in (10), then\np1 (Q) is replaced with p1 (T \u03a3), and (10) looks superficially the same as (9). There are,\n3\n\n\fhowever, a number of significant differences between our result and Mourad's analysis as\nfollows:\n(i) In (9), FSU (2) is the field strength of the unbroken SU(2) subgroup of SO(32), whereas\nin (10) is that of the enhanced SU(2) gauge group which is independent of the bulk\nSO(32) gauge symmetry.\n(ii) Although one could decompose SO(32) representations into those of the subgroup\nSO(28)\u00d7SU(2) in (10), the supermultiplets turn out to transform quite differently from\nthose in our \"broken\" case. For instance, we have an SO(28) \u00d7 SU(2) bifundamental,\nwhile there arise no such representations in the small-instanton case.\n(iii) Mourad's proof of cancellation extends to k(\u2265 2) D5-branes, while it is not obvious to\ngeneralize our argument to the case of many heterotic 5-branes.\n(iv) It is also difficult to include the normal-bundle contributions in our case; a naive\ninclusion of them does not lead to the desired factorized form. Since it is known\nthat the mechanisms of normal bundle anomaly cancellation on M5-branes requires a\ncomplicated setting [11], we might also need to consider in heterotic string theories\nsuch a modification of the solution without small instantons.\nSince the heterotic/type I duality is a strong-weak duality, there is no guarantee that how\nanomalies cancel in one theory will be the same in the other theory. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the superficial similarity between (9) and (10) will be an accident for k = 1.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank T. Kimura for helpful discussions. We also thank Y.
