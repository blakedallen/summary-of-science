Birla Science Centre, Adarsh Nagar, Hyderabad - 500 063 (India)\nAbstract\nWe consider two situatiions that can be modeled by oscillators.\nFirst we show that the universe itself is a normal mode of Planck\nscale oscillators. Next we show that a background Zero Point Field\nor dark energy can be modeled by electromagnetic oscillators. This in\nturn leads to an observable \"fluctuational\" current in a solenoid.\n\n1\n\nPlanck Scale Oscillators\n\nIn an earlier communication [1], it was argued that a typical elementary\nparticle like a pion could be considered to be the result of 1040 evanescent\nPlanck scale particles. The argument was based on random motions and also\non the modification to the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the\nproblem from a totally different point of view, which not only reconfirms the\nabove result, but also enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire\nuniverse itself.\nWe first consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance \u2206x apart, which\nbehave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then\nhave [2, 3]\n\u221a\nr = N\u2206x2\n(1)\n1\nka2 \u2261 k\u2206x2 = kB T\n2\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, r the extent and k\nis the spring constant given by\n\u03c902 =\n\u03c9=\n\nk 2\na\nm\n\nk\nm\n\n!1\n2\n\na\n1\n= \u03c90\nr\nr\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nWe now identify the particles with Planck masses, set \u2206x \u2261 a = lP , the\nPlanck length. It may be immediately observed that use of (3) and (2) gives\nkB T \u223c mP c2 , which ofcourse agrees with the temperature of a black hole of\nPlanck mass. Indeed Rosen had shown that a Planck mass particle at the\nPlanck scale can be considered to be a universe in itself [4].\nWe now use the fact alluded to that a typical elementary particle like the pion\ncan be considered to be the result of N \u223c 1040 Planck masses (Cf.ref.[1]).\nUsing this in (1), we get r \u223c l, the pion Compton wavelength as required.\nFurther, using (2), (3) and (4), we get for a pion,\nkB T =\n\nm3 c4 l2\n= mc2 ,\nh\u0304\n\nwhich ofcourse is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for\nelementary particles like pions. In other words, this confirms the conclusions\nin [1], that we can treat an elementary particle as a series of some 1040 Planck\nmass oscillators.\nHowever it must be observed from (2) and (3), that while the Planck mass\ngives the highest energy state, an elementary particle like the pion is in the\nlowest energy state. This explains why we encounter elementary particles,\nrather than Planck mass particles in nature. Infact as already noted [5, 6],\na Planck mass particle decays via the Bekenstein radiation within a Planck\ntime \u223c 10\u221242 secs. On the other hand, the lifetime of an elementary particle\nwould be very much higher.\nUsing the fact that the universe consists of n \u223c 1080 elementary particles\nlike the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of\n10120 Planck mass oscillators? This is what we will now show. Infact if we\nuse equation (1) with\nN \u223c 10120 ,\n\n2\n\n\fwe can see that the extent r \u223c 1028 cms which is of the order of the diametre\nof the universe itself. Next using (4) we get\n(min)\n\nnh\u0304\u03c90\n\nlP\n\u2248 mP c2 \u00d7 1060\n1028\n\n(5)\n\nwhich gives the correct mass of the universe. In other words the universe\nitself can be considered to be a normal mode of Planck scale oscillators.\n\n2\n\nOscillators and Dark Energy\n\nThe existence of the Zero Point Field (ZPF) was realised even by Max Planck.\nIn its later version it has come to be known as Quantum Vaccuum, and lately\nit has been possible to identify it with the mysterious dark energy. The Zero\nPoint Field arises because of the fact that though classically, an oscillator\nin the ground state has zero energy, Quantum Mechanically, owing to the\nuncertainity principle, there is an energy fluctuation about the zero energy\nlevel.\nInterestingly there have been two schools of thought. Zero Point Field, according to Quantum theoriests is a secondary effect arising from the already\npresent oscilaltors. However according to what has come to be known as\nStochastic Electrodynamics, the ZPF is primary, and infact Quantum Mechanics can be deduced therefrom. This is a chicken and egg situation.\nRecently the ZPF has come into focus once again because of the observed\never expanding, accelerating feature of the universe. In other words there is a\nlarge scale repulsion represented by a cosmological constant \u039b once invented\nand then rejected by Einstein, and this cosmic repulsion could be attributed\nto a mysterious all pervading dark energy, which can be identified with the\nZPF: this could be the mechanism which drives the cosmic expansion and\nacceleration (Cf.ref.[7]) for a review).\nTwo of the earliest realisations of the ZPF were in the form of the Lamb shift\nand the Casimir effect.\nIn the case of the Lamb shift, as is well known, the motion of an orbiting\nelectron gets affected by the background ZPF. Effectively there is an additioinal field, over and above that of the nucleus. This additional potential,\nas is well known is given by [8]\n1\n\u2206V (~r) = h(\u2206r)2 i\u22072 V (~r)\n2\n3\n\n\fThe additional energy\n\u2206E = h\u2206V (~r)i\ncontributes to the observed Lamb shift which is \u223c 1000mc/sec.\nThe essential idea of the Casimir effect is that the interaction between the\nZPF and matter leads to macroscopic consequences. For example if we consider two parallel metallic plates in a conducting box, then we should have a\nCasimir force given by [9]\n\u2212\u03c0 2 h\u0304cA\nF =\n240 l4\nwhere A is the area of the plates and l is the distance between them. More\ngenerally, the Casimir force is a result of the boundedness or deviation from\na Euclidean topology of or in the Quantum Vaccuum. These Casimir forces\nhave been experimentally demonstrated [10, 11, 12, 13].\nReturning to the ZPF as the ubiquitous dark energy, we observe that [14], a\nfluctuating electromagnetic field can be modelled as an infinite collection of\nindependent harmonic oscillators. Quantum Mechanically, the ground state\nof the harmonic oscillators is described by\nm\u03c9\n\u03c8(x) =\n\u03c0h\u0304\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/4\n\ne\u2212(m\u03c9/2h\u0304)x\n\n2\n\nwhich exhibits the probability for the oscillator to fluctuate, mostly in the\nregion given by\n\u2206x \u223c (h\u0304/m\u03c9)1/2\nAn infinite collection of such oscillators can be modelled by\n\u03c8(\u03be1 , \u03be2 , * * *) = const. exp[\u2212(\u03be12 + \u03be22 + * * *)],\nwhich gives the probability amplitude for an electromagnetic field configuration B(x, y, z), \u03be1 , etc. being the Fourier coefficients. Finally, as a consequence there is a fluctuating magnetic field given by\n\u221a\nh\u0304c\nB= 2\n(6)\nl\nwhere l is the extent over which the fluctuation is measured. Further these\nfluctuations typically take place within the time \u03c4 , a typical elementary particle Compton time (Cf.ref.[1]). This begs the question whether such ubiquotous fields could be tapped for terrestrial applications or otherwise.\n4\n\n\fWe now invoke the well known result from macroscopic physics that the\ncurrent in a coil is given by\nNBA\n\u0131=\n(7)\nR\u2206t\nwhere N is the numer of turns of the coil, A is its area and R the resistance.\nIntroducing (6) into (7) we deduce that a coil in the ZPF would have a\nfluctuating electric current given by\n\u0131\u2248\n\nNA e\n*\nR l2 \u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nIn principle it should be possible to harness the current (8). While this\ncurrent is small, if we have a superconductor, then R would be very small\nand the current would be much larger. The question is, whether such an\napplication is possible, on the earth or in an orbiting space craft, for example.\nFinally, it may be remarked that the usual ZPF of Quantum Theory leads to\nan unduly large cosmological constant [15]. However, in the model described\nin [5, 7], we get the observed small cosmological constant.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.G. Sidharth, Found. of Phys.Lett., 15 (6), December 2002, 577-583.\n[2] Y.
