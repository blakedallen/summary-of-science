Part of the reason is that the possibility exists to use\nthe electron's spin for quantum computations [3]. The basic principle of a spin transistor\nwas formulated in Ref. [4] for a waveguide in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI)\nor Rashba coupling [5] and was recently studied for a simple semiconductor waveguide using\na tight-binding model [6] or periodically modulated waveguides [7]. Various spin-filtering [8]\nor spin-valve [9] effects have been studied and several designs have been proposed to spinpolarize electronic currents in nanostructures [8, 10] among other studies of SOI effects on the\nband structure and transport of similar systems [11, 12]. In this respect several efforts have\nbeen made using ferromagnet-semiconductor interfaces to produce spin-polarized electrons,\nbut this method must face the mismatch of physical parameters between these two quite\ndifferent materials [13]. Another idea is to employ diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS),\nwhich can match well with other extensively used semiconductors like AlGaAs, and has\ncreated a lot of interest in DMS [14, 15].\nSpin degeneracy in semiconductors results from inversion symmetry, in space and time,\nof the considered system. By introducing a spatial inversion asymmetry, one can realize spin\nsplitting for carriers of finite momentum without applying any external magnetic field. This\nso-called Rashba effect or spin-orbit interaction (SOI) [5, 16] has been confirmed experimentally in various semiconductor structures [17]. In semiconductor heterostructures this spatial\ninversion asymmetry can be easily obtained by either built-in and external electric fields or\nby the position-dependent band edges. It is found that in many cases, especially in narrow\ngap semiconductor structures, the corresponding SOI is a linear function of the electronic\n\u2192\nmomentum k expressed as the Rashba term \u2212\n\u03c3 * (k \u00d7 E) in the electron Hamiltonian, where\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c3 is the Pauli spin matrix and E the local electric field. Thus, a local electric field E acts\non the electronic spin like a local magnetic field perpendicular to the directions of E and of\nthe electron momentum. The Rashba parameter is proportional to the average value of E\nand can be well controlled by a top (back) gate over (below) the device [18].\nBallistic spinless electronic transport has been studied extensively in systems of reduced\ndimensionality [19, 20] but until recently it was not known how to effectively control the\nspin-polarized flux in the relevant systems. In previous work [7] we showed how spin2\n\n\fpolarized transport can be realized and controlled in stubbed waveguides mostly when only\nspin-up or spin-down electrons are injected and only one mode propagates in the waveguide.\nOur treatment, which showed how a square-wave and spin-dependent transmission could be\nrealized, relied on the weakness of the SOI and the neglect of subband mixing due to this\ninteraction. This put some constrains on the ranges of various parameters, namely the width\nof the waveguide, the height of the attached stubs, and the energy of the incident electrons.\nIn the present paper we build upon this work and study in detail the effects of subband\nmixing which, to our knowledge, have been dealt with only partly in Ref. [6] for waveguides\nwithout stubs. In doing so we relax substantially the constrains mentioned above. Again\nour aim is to investigate in detail the conditions for the realization of a spin transistor in\nperiodically stubbed semiconductor waveguides in the presence of SOI. As will be shown,\nwe find new results (peaks or dips) in the transmission as a function of the incident electron\nenergy or of the stub height, but its square-wave pattern, as a function of the stubs' degree\nof asymmetry, remains robust.\nIn Sec. II we present the formalism and contrast the results for the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors with those obtained without subband mixing. In Sec. III we formulate the\ntransmission problem and in Sec. IV we present numerical results. Concluding remarks\nfollow in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nWhen a typical two-dimensional (2D) electronic system, such as an InGaAs/InAlAs quantum well, is confined, e.g., by a potential V (x) along the x direction, we have a quasi-onedimensional (Q1D) electronic system such as the stubbed waveguide shown in Fig. 1.

The parameter \u03b1\nwhere \u03bb = ~2 /2m\u2217 , \u2207\nmeasures the strength of the SOI and is proportional to the interface electric field; ~\u03c3 =\n(\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) denotes the spin Pauli matrices, and p~ is the momentum operator.

The height of the stubs is h, their length b, and the\nlength between them l. The asymmetry parameter d is the distance between the centerline of the\nwaveguide and stubs.\n\nfunction can be expressed in the form\n\u03a8ky (r) = eiky y\n\nX\nn\u03c3\n\nwith |\u03c3i =\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n1\n0\n\n\u03c6n (x)Cn\u03c3 |\u03c3i = eiky y\n\nfor spin up (+) and\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n0\n1\n\nX\nn\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c6n (x) \uf8ed\n\nCn+\nCn\u2212\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(2)\n\nfor spin down (-). \u03c6(x) is the eigenfunction of\n\nthe 1D Hamiltonian h(x) = \u2212\u03bb\u22072x + V (x) with an assumed square-well confining potential\nV (x).\n\nWe insert this eigenfunction in the equation H\u03a8 = E\u03a8, multiply both sides by \u03c6m (x),\nR\nR\nand integrate over x. With dx\u03c6m (x)\u03c6n (x) = \u03b4mn and Jmn = dx\u03c6m (x)\u03c6\u2032n (x) we obtain\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n+\n+\nX\nE \u2212 E \u03b1ky\nC\n0 1\nC\n\uf8f0 m\n\uf8fb\uf8ed m \uf8f8 + \u03b1\n\uf8fb \uf8ed n \uf8f8 = 0,\nJmn \uf8f0\n(3)\n0\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03b1ky Em\n\u2212E\nCm\n\u22121\n0\nC\nn\nn\n0\nwhere Em\n= Em + \u03bbky2 ; the index m labels the discrete subbands resulting from the confine-\n\nment along the x axis.\n4\n\n\fAs shown elsewhere [7], if we neglect mixing between the subbands by assuming Jmn \u2248 0,\nwe can easily solve Eq. (3). This procedure is valid for |\u03b1Jmn | \u226a |Em \u2212 En |. The resulting\neigenvalues read\nE \u00b1 (ky ) = Em + ~2 ky2 /2m\u2217 \u00b1 \u03b1ky .\n\n(4)\n\n+\n\u2212\nThe eigenvectors corresponding to E + , E \u2212 satisfy Cm\n= \u00b1Cm\n. Accordingly, the spin eigen-\n\nfunctions can be taken as\n|\u00b1i =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011 \u221a\n/ 2.\n\u00b11\n1\n\n(5)\n\nAn important aspect in this case is that the difference in wave vectors ky+ and ky\u2212 , resulting\nfrom E + = E \u2212 = E, is constant: it reads\nky\u2212 \u2212 ky+ = 2m\u2217 \u03b1/~2 .\n\n(6)\n\nTo go beyond this limiting case, described by Jmn \u2248 0, and still have a tractable problem,\nwe neglect all Jmn terms except J21 and J12 = \u2212J21 = 8/3w = \u03b4, where w is the width of the\nwaveguide along x.

(6). We further notice that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors given\nabove reduce to those given, respectively, by Eqs. (4) and (5) if we set \u03b4 = 0.\nThe dispersion relation given by Eq. (8) for the lowest two subbands is shown in Fig.\n6\n\n\f\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n2 by the solid curves. For an electron of energy E in branches \u03b5+\n1 , \u03b51 , \u03b52 , and \u03b52 , the\n\ncorresponding wave vectors along y are k1+ (\u2212k1\u2212 ), k1\u2212 (\u2212k1+ ), k2+ (\u2212k2\u2212 ), and k2\u2212 (\u2212k2+ ),\nrespectively. When an electron with a positive wave vector ky has an energy much higher\nthan Ec = 5E1 /2 + 9~2 E12 /(8m\u2217 \u03b12 ), the value at which anticrossing due to the SOI occurs\n\u0010 \u0011\n1\n\u2212\nbetween the \u03b5+\nand\nthe\n\u03b5\nbranches,\nits\nspin\nis\nup\nalong\nthe\nx\ndirection\n(|\u03c3i\n=\n) when\n1\n2\n1\n\u0010 \u0011\n1\n\u2212\nit is in the two higher spin branches (\u03b5+\n) when it is in the\n2 , and \u03b52 ) and down (|\u03c3i =\n\u22121\nother two branches. When its energy is lower than Ec , its spin is up in the \"+\" branches\n+\n(\u03b5+\n1 , and \u03b52 ) and down in the \"-\" branches. Electrons of the same energy and the same but\n\nopposite momentum have always opposite spin orientation. Similar observations were made\nin Ref. [12] for a quantum wire with parabolic confinement. One interesting case is that\nan electron of positive momentum always has its spin pointing down and vice versa in the\nbag of each branch \u03b5\u03c3n with energy between the bottom of the branch and zero-momentum\nenergy \u03b50n . Another noteworthy feature in Fig. 2 is that mode mixing makes the wave vector\ndifferences k1+ \u2212 k1\u2212 and k2+ \u2212 k2\u2212 depend slightly on the energy. The length of the horizontal\nsegment AC between the dotted curves, given by Eq. (6), is constant and independent of\nthe energy whereas that of the segment AB between the solid curves is not and depends on\nthe energy; AB satisfies Eq. (6) only approximately.\n\nIII.\n\nFORMULATION OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM\n\nLet us consider the transmission process when an electron of energy E is incident from the\nleft to a stubbed waveguide shown in Fig. 1. The electron wave function is decomposed into\n\"+\" and \"-\" branches in all regions in Fig. 1. In each region we have \u03c6n (x) = sin(n\u03c0(x +\nw/2)/w), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 w, where w is the width along the x direction.

In this\n\npaper we study the case where the electron energy is low enough so that at most two modes\npropagate in the waveguide segments (region I and III) though more modes are considered\nin the stubs (region II). We proceed as follows.\nWe match the wave functions of different regions at y = 0 and y = b: we multiply by\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03a8+\n1h (\u03b31 ), \u03a81h (\u03b31 ), \u03a82h (\u03b32 ), and \u03a82h (\u03b32 ), respectively, the equations \u03a8s (y = 0) = \u03a81 (y = 0)\n\nand \u03a8s (y = b) = \u03a82 (y = b). Then integrating over x we obtain eight linear equations for the\neight coefficients of the wave functions of the two lowest coupled subbands denoted by the\nmatrices \u00db T = (u1 , \u016b1, v1 , v\u03041 , u2 , \u016b2, v2 , v\u03042 ), in region II, L\u0302T = (c1 , c\u03041 , d1 , d \u03041 , c2 , c\u03042 , d2 , d \u03042 ) in\n12\n\nregion I, and by\n\n12\n\nT\nR\u030212\n\n= (a1 , \u01011 , b1 , b\u03041 , a2 , \u01012 , b2 , b\u03042 ) in region III, where T denotes the transfer\n\nmatrix. This gives\nM\u030212 \u00db12 = P\u030212 L\u030212 + Q\u030212 R\u030212 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe coefficients corresponding to n > 2, \u00dbnT = (un , \u016bn , vn , v\u0304n ), can be found in a similar way\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nby multiplying by \u03a8+\nnh (\u03b3n ) and \u03a8nh (\u03b3n ) before integrating over x; the result is\n\nM\u0302n \u00dbn = P\u0302n L\u0302n + Q\u0302n R\u030212 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe matrices M\u030212 , P\u030212 , Q\u030212 , M\u0302n , P\u0302n , Q\u0302n as well as the matrices N\u030212 , N\u0302n , \u00dbn , \u03b7\u030212 , \u03b2\u030212 , appearing\nin Eqs. (14) and (15), are specified in the appendix.\nWe now match the derivatives of the wave functions at y = 0 and y = b and multiply by\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u03a8+\n1c (\u03b71 ), \u03a81c (\u03b71 ), \u03a82c (\u03b72 ), \u03a82c (\u03b72 ) the equation d\u03a8s /dy|y=0 = d\u03a81 /dy|y=0 and by \u03a81a (\u03b21 ),\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03a8\u2212\n1a (\u03b21 ), \u03a82a (\u03b22 ), \u03a82a (\u03b22 ) the equation d\u03a8s /dy|y=b = d\u03a81 /dy|y=b .

However, when a gate voltage is applied to the stubs to increase their height h, the\nsecond subband approaches the first one and the mixing between them becomes stronger.\n9\n\n\f1.0\n\n(a)\nT\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nT\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n11.2\n\n11.6\nh (100\u00c5)\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nT\n\n--\n\n(b)\n\n0.0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nh (100\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 3: Transmission T as a function of the stub height h for one stub. Panel (a) is for spin up\nand panel (b) for spin down. The solid curves include subband mixing, the dotted ones do not.\nNotice the absence of the first peak in (a) and the first dip in (b) when mixing is neglected. The\ninset in (a) is a detailed view of the first peak.\n\nIf not otherwise specified, we consider only spin-up incident electrons and the following\nparameters: width a = c = 500 \u00c5, stub height h = 1600\u00c5, stub length b = 660\u00c5, waveguide\nsegment length l = 1050\u00c5, asymmetry parameter d = 0, electron energy E = 4meV, and\n\u03b1 = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 eV m. The conductance G at zero temperature can be expressed in terms of\nthe transmission T as G = (e2 /h)T .\n\nIn Fig. 3, we show the spin-up (a) and spin-down transmission (b) through one unit\nwith one symmetric stub as a function of the stub height h when only spin-up electrons are\nincident. The solid curves denote the results with mixing and the dotted ones without it.\nThe only influence of the mixing in (a) is that a nearly zero transmission is followed by a\ntransmission peak in the range 1100\u00c5 \u2264 h \u2264 1200\u00c5. The form of the peak is shown in\ndetail in the inset. In contrast, in the same range of h the spin-down transmission in (b)\nshows a dip instead of a peak. This happens when h has such a value that the first and\nthe second subbands in the stubs are coupled with each other by the mixing term Jmn and\nboth of them are coupled well with the waveguide mode through the interface connecting\nthe stub and waveguide. The numerical result shows that the phase of the output electrons\nis changed by the shift of h when this transmission oscillation happens, which has not been\nobserved when mixing is neglected [7]. Correspondingly, the phase difference between the\n\"+\" and \"-\" branches and the spin orientation of the output electrons is changed by h but\nthe total transmission is kept constant.

Notice the wide gap for both spin states starting at about\nh=1500\u00c5. Again the results without mixing (dotted curves) miss the prominent structure near\nh=1120\u00c5. The inset in (b) is a detailed view of the region 1120 \u00c5 \u2264 h \u2264 1160 \u00c5.\n\nSOI mixing is that the precession of the electronic spins depends not only on the length of\nthe waveguide but also on its shape and width. If we change the parameter \u03b1 to shift the\nanticrossing energy Ec , the position of the oscillation does not shift but its amplitude can\nchange. For the parameters used here the electron energy is close to Ec .\nNext we evaluate the transmission of a structure composed of five units identical to the\none above. We obtain a square-wave pattern of the transmission if we neglect mixing, as\nshown by the dotted curves in Fig. 4. Surprisingly, the subband mixing does not change\nthe square-wave form of the transmission gap. Nevertheless, both spin-up and spin-down\ntransmissions shift here and there and five oscillations appear for h = 1120\u00c5. The inset in\nFig. 4 (b) shows in detail these oscillations. It is worth noting that here the transmission\nis much more sensitive to the variation of h than that in the previous one-unit case and its\noscillations may be weakened or rounded off by lateral fluctuations of h which are expected\nto occur in real nanostructures.\nNow we fix the height h so that all electrons are reflected: for one stub this happens at\nh = 1562\u00c5 and for five stubs at h = 1600\u00c5. Then we shift the stub along the x direction\nto change the asymmetry parameter d. The result is shown in Fig. 5 and the mixing effect\nis negligible. The change in curve order from (a) to (b) is due the change in the length of\nthe structure.\nThe transmission through one unit versus the electron energy is shown in Fig. 6 for d = 0.\nAs in Fig. 3, we observe similar peaks (dips) in the spin-up (spin-down) transmission due\n\n11\n\n\fT\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\nT\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nd (100\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 5: Transmission T as a function of the asymmetry parameter d for one stub in (a) and\nfive stubs in (b).

As can be seen, its qualitative behavior remains the same upon\nchanging \u03b1. The main change is in the relative contributions to the total transmission of\nthe spin-up and spin-down states. This results from the phase difference ky\u2212 \u2212 ky+ : when\n\nmixing is included, Eq. (4), ky\u2212 \u2212 ky+ = 2m\u2217 \u03b1/~2 , is only approximately satisfied, cf. Fig. 2.\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe investigated the influence of subband mixing on the spin-dependent electronic transmission through periodically stubbed waveguides in the presence of a weak spin-orbit interaction (SOI). As we saw, the mixing affects mainly the transmission as a function of the\nincident electron energy and of the stub height and gives rise to the prominent peaks (dips)\nthat are absent when this mixing is negligible. In contrast, the square-wave pattern of the\n13\n\n\ftransmission remains robust when the stubs' degree of asymmetry is varied.\nThe results we reported were obtained with parameters more easily accessible to experiments than those of Ref. [7]. For instance, the waveguide width is twice bigger and the\nincident (Fermi) energy four times smaller. We hope that this will further motivate the\nrelevant experiments especially since, as we showed, a weak mixing leaves almost intact the\nsquare-wave pattern of the transmission as a function of the stubs' degree of asymmetry.\nThough we didn't show any results as a function of the temperature T , we verified and\ncan affirm that the T dependence of the transmission is identical to that reported in Ref.\n[7]. Finite temperatures T smoothen the curves obtained at T = 0. As the ratio EF /kB T\ndecreases, the curves are smoothened or rounded off more strongly.\nFinally, we also showed that varying the strength of the SOI parameter changes only\nthe relative contribution to the total transmission of the spin-up and spin-down states.\nAlthough side gates, needed to control the height h and the distance d, may result in\nlateral fluctuations, e.g., of h, and though they do not directly address the electron spin,\nthey directly affect the phase of the wave functions in the stubs and accordingly control,\nthrough the matching procedure, the transmission profile of either spin orientation. As a\nresult, the nearly square-wave pattern of the transmission can be made more robust if we\ncombine several units. This renders the structure we considered a reasonable candidate for\nestablishing a spin transistor.\nNote added in Proof. The journal reviewers brought to our attention Ref. [21] in which\nthe effect of subband mixing, due to the SOI, on the transmission of electrons with energies\nnear the anti-crossing energy Ec was considered in one section of waveguide. The results of\nthis work, obtained in an approximate way, are similar to ours but apply only to a stubless\nwaveguide.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Canadian NSERC Grant No. OGP0121756.\n\n14\n\n\fVII.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\u2032\n\nThough not appearing explicitly, the product h\u03a8\u03c3nw (k)|\u03a8\u03c3n\u2032w\u2032 (k \u2032 )i in all matrix products\nR\n\u2032\nmentioned below denotes the integral \u03a8\u03c3nw (k, x)\u03a8\u03c3n\u2032 w\u2032 (k \u2032 , x)dx, where \u03a8\u03c3nw (x) is the wavefunction along x of a waveguide of width w, n is its subband index, k the wavevector, and\n\n\u03c3 the electron spin.
