Recently, strong interest on this issue revived\nin extreme environments especially at high temperatures\nand baryon densities, stimulated by the heavy-ion programs at GSI, CERN SPS, RHIC and LHC, see e.g.,\n[1, 2] for a review. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\nfor strong interactions is a fundamental theory for solving this problem.\nIn pure Yang-Mills theory, i.e., in the limit of infinitely\nheavy quark mass mq \u2192 \u221e of QCD, the Polyakov loop\naverage hLi, i.e., the vacuum expectation value of the\nPolyakov loop operator L, can be used as a criterion for\nquark confinement [3]. The Polyakov loop operator L is a\ngauge invariant operator charged under the center group\nZ(Nc ) of the color gauge group SU (Nc ). The Polyakov\nloop average hLi vanishes hLi = 0 and quarks are confined at low temperatures T < Td where the global center\nsymmetry Z(Nc ) is intact, while it is nonzero hLi 6= 0 and\nquarks are deconfined at high temperature T > Td where\nthe global center symmetry Z(Nc ) is spontaneously broken. Thus, we can define Td as a critical temperature for\nconfinement/deconfinement phase transition.\nWhen dynamical quarks in the fundamental representation of the gauge group are added to the Yang-Mills\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kondok@faculty.chiba-u.jp\n\ntheory, the center symmetry is no longer exact. On the\nother hand, QCD with massless quarks mq \u2192 0 exhibits\nchiral symmetry SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R . The chiral condensate h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i, i.e., the vacuum expectation value of a\ngauge-invariant composite operator \u03c8\u0304\u03c8, is used as an order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking. The chiral\ncondensate h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i is nonzero h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i 6= 0 at low temperatures T < T\u03c7 where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken, while it vanishes h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i = 0 at high temperature\nT > T\u03c7 where the chiral symmetry is restored. Thus,\nwe can define T\u03c7 as a critical temperature for chiralsymmetry breaking/restoration phase transition.\nFor realistic quark mass (with finite and nonzero mq :\n0 < mq < \u221e), there are no exact symmetries directly\nrelated to the phase transitions, since both the center\nand chiral symmetries are explicitly broken, and hLi and\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 are approximate order parameters. In this case,\nthere is no critical temperature Tc in strict sense, and\nthe transition can be a crossover transition for which the\npseudo critical temperature Tc\u2217 is defined such that the\nsusceptibility takes the maximal value at T = Tc\u2217 . If\nquarks are in the fundamental representation, deconfinement (a rise in the Polyakov loop average) happens at\nthe temperature where the chiral symmetry is restored\n(chiral condensate decreases rapidly). The chiral and deconfinement transitions seems to coincide, Td\u2217 = T\u03c7\u2217 \u2243 Tc\n[4, 5], although the property of the phase transition,\ne.g., the critical temperature and the order of the transition depend on numbers of color Nc and flavor Nf .\nWhereas, for quarks in the adjoint representation, deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration do not happen\nat the same temperature, rather T\u03c7\u2217 \u226b Td\u2217 [6]. Although\n\n\f2\nthere exist theoretical considerations on the interplay between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement at zero\nbaryon density [7], the underlying reasons for the coincidence are still unknown and uncertain at nonzero baryon\ndensity [8\u201310].\nThe hadronic properties, especially, chiral dynamics\nat low energy have been successfully described by chiral effective models such as the linear sigma model [11],\nthe Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [12\u201314], the chiral random matrix model [15], chiral perturbation theory\n[16] and so on. However, those models based on chiral\nsymmetry lack any dynamics coming from confinement\ndictated by the Polyakov loop, although there are some\nefforts to clarify the interplay between chiral dynamics\nand the Polyakov loop [17, 18].\nRecent chiral effective models with the Polyakov loop\ndegrees of freedom augmented called the Polyakov loop\u2013\nextended NJL (PNJL) model or quark-meson (PQM)\nmodel [19\u201326] are successful from a phenomenological\npoint of view to incorporate a coupling between the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop. However, these\nPNJL/PQM models are still far from treating the chiral\ncondensate and the Polyakov loop on an equal footing,\nexcept for the work [26] where the backcoupling of the\nmatter sector to the glue sector was discussed by changing the phase transition parameter. In fact, the gluonic\npart in these models has several fitting parameters which\nare determined only from lattice QCD data.\nHere we must mention a preceding work for a firstprinciple derivation of confinement/deconfinement and\nchiral-symmetry-breaking/restoration crossover phase\ntransition based on the flow equation [27] of the functional renormalization group [28, 29] given by Braun,\nHaas, Marhauser and Pawlowski [33] for the full dynamical QCD with 2 massless flavors (at zero and imaginary\nchemical potential). In this work, the Yang-Mills theory\nis fully coupled to the matter sector by taking into account the Polyakov-loop effective potential [30] obtained\nin a nonperturbative way put forward by Braun, Gies\nand Pawlowski [32] and Marhauser and Pawlowski [31].\nThe main purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework (a reformulation of QCD) which enables one to describe in a unified way the chiral dynamics and confinement signaled by the Polyakov loop. We\ngive an important step towards a first-principle derivation of confinement/deconfinement and chiral-symmetry\nbreaking/restoration crossover transition. In fact, we\ndemonstrate that a low-energy effective theory of QCD\nobtained in simple but non-trivial approximations within\nthis framework enables one to treat both transitions simultaneously on equal footing.\nThe basic ingredients in this paper are a reformulation of QCD based on new variables [34\u201341, 43\u201346, 48\u2013\n53] and the flow equation of the Wetterich type in the\nWilsonian renormalization group [27\u201329]. The reformulation was used to confirm quark confinement in pure\nYang-Mills theory at zero temperature and zero density\nbased on a dual superconductor picture [56]. In this pa-\n\nper, it is extended to QCD at finite temperature and\ndensity. In principle, our framework can be applied to\nany color gauge group and arbitrary number of flavors.\nFor technical reasons, however, we study two color QCD\nwith two flavors in this paper. The three color and/or\nthree flavor case will be studied in a subsequent paper.\nIn future publications, this framework will be applied to\ninvestigate the QCD phase diagram at finite density. We\nhope that this paper will give an insight into this issue\ncomplementary to other works, e.g., [33].\nIn sec. II, we give a reformulation of QCD written in\nterms of new variables and explain why the reformulated\nQCD is efficient to study the interplay between confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking.\nIn sec. III, we choose a specific gauge (modified\nPolyakov gauge) to simplify the representation of the\nPolyakov loop. We can choose any gauge to calculate the\nPolyakov loop average and the chiral condensate, since\nboth are gauge-invariant quantities and should not depend on the gauge chosen.\nIn sec. IV, we give a definition of the Polyakov loop\noperator and examine how the Polyakov loop average is\nrelated to the average of the time-component of the gauge\nfield.\nIn sec. V and sec. VI, we study the confinement/deconfinement phase transition in pure SU (2)\nYang-Mills theory at finite temperature. We exploit the\nWilsonian renormalization group in our framework to obtain the effective potential Veff of the Polyakov loop L,\nwhose minimum gives the Polyakov loop average hLi. It\nis known that the Weiss potential VW [30] calculated in\nthe perturbation theory to one loop exhibits spontaneous\ncenter-symmetry breaking, i.e., deconfinement, irrespective of the temperature T . This result can be used at\nhigh temperature where the perturbation theory will be\ntrustworthy due to asymptotic freedom, while nonperturbative approach is necessary to treat the low-temperature\ncase. The Weiss potential can be improved according to\nthe Wilsonian renormalization group to obtain a nonperturbative effective potential which is valid even at low\ntemperature.\nIn sec. V, we write down the flow equation of the\nWetterich type for the effective potential of the Polyakov\nloop in our framework. In fact, the effective potential\nobtained by solving the flow equation in a numerical way\nshows the existence of confinement phase below a certain\ntemperature Td . This solution was shown for the first\ntime by Marhauser and Pawlowski [31] and by Braun,\nGies and Pawlowski [32], see [54] for the previous works.\nIn this sense, this section is nothing but the translation\nof their results [31, 32] into our framework.\nIn sec. VI, we give a qualitative understanding for\nthe confinement/deconfinement transition given in sec.\nV based on the Landau-Ginzburg argument. We answer\na question why the center-symmetry restoration occurs\nas the temperature is decreased, by observing the flow\nequation for the coefficient of the effective potential.\nIn sec. VII, we describe the low-energy effective in-\n\n\f3\nteraction among quarks by a nonlocal version of the\n(gauged) NJL model in which the effect of confinement is\nexplicitly incorporated through the Polyakov loop dependent nonlocal interaction. The resulting effective theory\nis regarded as a modified and improved version of nonlocal Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL)\nmodels proposed recently by Hell, R\u00f6ssner, Cristoforetti and Weise [22], Sasaki, Friman and Redlich [23], and\nBlaschke, Buballa, Radzhabov and Volkov [24], extending the original (local) PNJL model by Fukushima [19].\nThe nonlocal (gauged) NJL model can be converted to\nthe nonlocal (gauged) Yukawa model to be bosonized to\nstudy the chiral dynamics.\nIn sec. VIII, we show that the nonlocal NJL interaction\namong quarks becomes temperature dependent through\nthe coupling to the Polyakov loop. This is a first nontrivial indication for the entanglement between the chiral\nsymmetry breaking and confinement. This feature was\noverlooked in conventional PNJL models.\nIn sec. IX, we consider how to understand the entanglement between confinement and chiral symmetry\nbreaking in our framework. This is just a short sketch\nfor our strategy following the line given in the preceding\nsections.\nThe final section is used to summarize the results and\ngive some perspective in the future works. Some technical\nmaterials are collected in Appendices.\nII.\n\nREFORMULATION OF QCD\n\nTo fix the notation, we write the action of QCD in\nterms of the gluon field A\u03bc and the quark field \u03c8:\nSQCD =Sq + SYM ,\nZ\nSq := dD x\u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc [A ] \u2212 m\u0302q + \u03bcq \u03b3 0 )\u03c8,\nZ\n\u22121\nSYM := dD x\ntr(F\u03bc\u03bd [A ]F \u03bc\u03bd [A ]),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the quark field, A\u03bc = A\u03bcA TA is the gluon\nfield with su(Nc ) generators TA for the gauge group G =\nSU (Nc ) (A = 1, * * * , dimSU (Nc ) = Nc2 \u2212 1), m\u0302q is the\nquark mass matrix, \u03bcq is the quark chemical potential,\n\u03b3 \u03bc are the Dirac gamma matrices (\u03bc = 0, * * * , D \u2212 1),\nD\u03bc [A ] := \u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc is the covariant derivative in the\nfundamental representation, F\u03bc\u03bd [A ] := \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212\nig[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] is the field strength and g is the QCD coupling\nconstant. In what follows, we suppress the spinor, color\nand flavor indices.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to give a theoretical framework for extracting a low-energy effective theory which enables one to discuss the confinement/deconfinement and chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration (crossover) transition simultaneously on\nan equal footing. We reformulate QCD in terms of new\nvariables which are efficient for this purpose. We start\nwith decomposing the original SU (N ) Yang-Mills field\n\nA\u03bc (x) = A\u03bcA (x)TA into two pieces V\u03bc = V\u03bcA (x)TA and\nX\u03bc = X\u03bcA (x)TA :\nA\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x),\n\n(2)\n\nto rewrite the original QCD action into a new form:\nZ\no\nn\nSq = dD x \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc [V ] \u2212 m\u0302q + \u03bcq \u03b3 0 )\u03c8 + gJ \u03bc * X\u03bc ,\nZ\nn \u22121\n1\nA\n\u03bdB\nSYM = dD x\n(F\u03bc\u03bd\n[V ])2 \u2212 X \u03bcA QAB\n\u03bc\u03bd X\n4\n2\no\n1\n(3)\n\u2212 (ig[X\u03bc , X\u03bd ])2 + SFP ,\n4\nwhere J \u03bcA := g \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc TA \u03c8 is the color current, D\u03bc [V ] :=\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ig[V\u03bc , *] is the covariant derivative in the adjoint\nrepresentation and\nAB\nC\nQAB\n[V ]g\u03bc\u03bd + 2gf ABC F\u03bc\u03bd\n[V ],\n\u03bc\u03bd [V ] :=G\n\nGAB [V ] := \u2212 (D\u03c1 [V ]D\u03c1 [V ])AB\n\n= \u2212 (\u2202\u03c1 \u03b4 AC + gf AEC V\u03c1E )(\u2202 \u03c1 \u03b4 CB + gf CF B V \u03c1F )\n= \u2212 \u2202\u03c12 \u03b4 AB + g 2 f AEC f BF C V\u03c1E V \u03c1F\n+ 2gf ABE V\u03c1E \u2202 \u03c1 + gf ABE \u2202 \u03c1 V\u03c1E .\n\n(4)\n\nIn what follows we use the notation A * B for two Liealgebra valued functions A = A A TA and B = B A TA\nin the sense that A * B := A A B A = 2tr(A B) and\nespecially A 2 := A * A = A A A A .\nHistorically, the decomposition of Yang-Mills theory\ninto new variables has been proposed by Cho [34] and\nDuan and Ge [35] independently, and readdressed later\nby Faddeev and Niemi [36]. The decomposition was further developed by Shabanov [37].\nThe decomposition (2) is performed such that V\u03bc\ntransforms under the gauge transformation just like the\noriginal gauge field A\u03bc :\nV\u03bc (x) \u2192 V\u03bc\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)(V\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc )\u03a9\u22121 (x),\n\n(5)\n\nwhile X\u03bc transforms like an adjoint matter field:\nX\u03bc (x) \u2192 X\u03bc\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)X\u03bc (x)\u03a9\u22121 (x).\n\n(6)\n\nIn the decomposition (2), we introduce a new field\nn(x) = nA (x)TA ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith a unit length in the sense that nA (x)nA (x) = 1,\nwhich we call the color field. In the decomposition (2),\nthe color field n(x) plays a crucial role as follows. The\ncolor field is defined by the following property. It must be\na functional or composite operator of the original YangMills field A\u03bc (x) such that it transforms according to the\nadjoint representation under the gauge transformation:\nn(x) \u2192 n\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)n(x)\u03a9\u22121 (x).\n\n(8)\n\nThe color field plays the key role in the reformulation.\nOnce a color field is given, the decomposition is uniquely\n\n\f4\ndetermined by solving a set of defining equations and\nhence V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are written in terms of A\u03bc (x)\nand n(x). For G = SU (2), the defining equations are\ngiven by\n(I) covariant constantness of color field n(x) in V\u03bc (x):\n0 = D\u03bc [V ]n(x),\n\n(9)\n\n(II) orthogonality of X\u03bc (x) to n(x):\n0 = X\u03bc (x) * n(x).\n\n(10)\n\nThen the decomposition for G = SU (2) is uniquely determined as\nV\u03bc (x) = c\u03bc (x)n(x) + ig \u22121 [n(x), \u2202\u03bc n(x)],\nc\u03bc (x) := A\u03bc (x) * n(x),\n\nX\u03bc (x) = ig\n\n\u22121\n\n[D\u03bc [A ]n(x), n(x)],\n\n[n(x), D\u03bc [A ]D\u03bc [A ]n(x)] = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nTo arrive at the result (3), we have used the following\nfacts. See Appendix A for the details.\n(i) The O(X ) terms vanish, 12 F \u03bc\u03bd [V ] * (D\u03bc [V ]X\u03bd \u2212\nD\u03bd [V ]X\u03bc ) = 0, from the property of the new variables\nas shown using the defining equations of the decomposition (2). This is somewhat similar to the usual background field method in which O(X ) terms in the quantum fluctuation field X\u03bc are eliminated by requiring that\nthe background field V\u03bc satisfies the classical Yang-Mills\nequation of motion, i.e., D\u03bc [V ]F \u03bc\u03bd [V ] = 0. In our case,\nhowever, V\u03bc do not necessarily satisfy the classical equation of motion.\n2\n(ii) To obtain QAB\n\u03bc\u03bd [V ] in (4), an O(X ) term is elim1\n\u03bcA AC\nCB\n\u03bdB\ninated, \u2212 2 X D\u03bc [V ]D\u03bd [V ]X\n= 0, by imposing\nthe condition:\nD\u03bc [V ]X \u03bc = 0.\n\n(12)\n\nFor the reformulated QCD to be equivalent to the original QCD, we must impose such a constraint to avoid\nmismatch in the independent degrees of freedom, which\nis called the reduction condition [38, 41].\n(iii) The O(X 3 ) term vanishes, 21 (D\u03bc [V ]X\u03bd \u2212\nD\u03bd [V ]X\u03bc )*ig[X \u03bc , X \u03bd ] = 0, since D\u03bc [V ]X\u03bd \u2212D\u03bd [V ]X\u03bc\nis orthogonal to [X \u03bc , X \u03bd ].\nFor G = SU (2), V can be chosen in such a way that\nthe field strength F [V ] of the field V is proportional to\nn:\nF\u03bc\u03bd [V ](x) :=\u2202\u03bc V\u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd V\u03bc (x) \u2212 ig[V\u03bc (x), V\u03bd (x)]\n=n(x)G\u03bc\u03bd (x),\n(13)\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd is a gauge\u2013invariant antisymmetric ten\u2032\nsor of rank 2, i.e., F\u03bc\u03bd\n[V ](x) = F\u03bc\u03bd [V \u2032 ](x) =\n\u22121\n\u03a9(x)F\u03bc\u03bd [V ](x)\u03a9 (x) = n\u2032 (x)G\u03bc\u03bd (x). The explicit\nform of G\u03bc\u03bd is written in term of A\u03bc (x) and n(x) as\nG\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u2202\u03bc [n(x) * A\u03bd (x)] \u2212 \u2202\u03bd [n(x) * A\u03bc (x)]\n+ ig \u22121 n(x) * [\u2202\u03bc n(x), \u2202\u03bd n(x)].\n\nIn the present approach, we wish to regard the field\ndecomposition as a change of variable from the original\ngluon field to new variables describing a reformulated\nYang-Mills theory in the quantum level [38, 40, 41] (see\n[42\u201349] for the corresponding lattice gauge formulation).\nTo achieve this goal, first of all, n(x) must be written\nas a functional of A\u03bc (x) and thereby all new fields are\nwritten in terms of the original gluon field A\u03bc (x). Such\na required relationship between A\u03bc (x) and n(x) is given\nby the reduction condition which is given as a variational\nproblem of obtaining an absolute minimum of a given\nfunctional. The condition for local minima is given in\nthe form of a differential equation. For G = SU (2),\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nThis is another form of (12). See [38] in SU (2) case and\n[41] in SU (N ) case for the full details.\nRemarkable properties of new variables are as follows.\nFirst, we remind you of the role played by the field V .\n\u2022 The variable V\u03bc alone is responsible for the Wilson\nloop operator WC [A ] and the Polyakov loop operator\nL[A ] in the sense that\nWC [A ] = WC [V ],\n\nL[A ] = L[V ].\n\nwhere the Wilson loop operator is defined by\n\u001b\u0015\n\u0014\n\u001a I\ndx\u03bc A\u03bc (x) ,\nWC [A] := N \u22121 tr P exp ig\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nC\n\nwhere P denotes the path ordering and the normalization factor N is the dimension of the representation R,\nin which the Wilson loop is considered, i.e., N := dR =\ndim(1R ) = tr(1R ). The Polyakov loop operator will be\ndefined later. In other words, X\u03bc do not contribute to\nthe Wilson loop and the Polyakov loop in the operator\nlevel. This is because the defining equation for the decomposition is a (necessary and) sufficient condition for\na gauge-invariant Abelian dominance (or V dominance)\nin the operator level. This proposition was first proved\nin [50] for SU (2) and for SU (N ) in the continuum [51]\nand for SU (N ) on a lattice [52]. On the lattice, the\nequality does not exactly hold due to non-zero lattice\nspacing \u01eb, but the deviation vanishes in the continuum\nlimit of the lattice spacing \u01eb going to zero, \u01eb \u2192 0. It\nshould be remarked that both the Wilson loop operator and the Polyakov loop operator are gauge-invariant\nquantities and that their average do not depend on the\ngauge fixing condition adopted in the calculation.\n\u2022 We can introduce a gauge-invariant magnetic\nmonopole current k in Yang-Mills theory (without matter fields) where k is the (D \u2212 3)-form. For D = 4 and\nG = SU (2),\nk\u03bc (x) :=\u2202\u03bd \u2217 G\u03bc\u03bd (x),\nG\u03bc\u03bd :=n * F\u03bc\u03bd [V ] = \u2202\u03bc c\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd c\u03bc + ig\n\n(18)\n\u22121\n\nn * [\u2202\u03bc n, \u2202\u03bd n],\n\nwhere f\u03bc\u03bd is gauge-invariant field strength. This is\nbecause the field strength F\u03bc\u03bd [V ] := \u2202\u03bc V\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd V\u03bc \u2212\n\n\f5\nig[V\u03bc , V\u03bd ] is proportional to n:\nF\u03bc\u03bd [V ] = n{\u2202\u03bc c\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd c\u03bc + ig \u22121 n * [\u2202\u03bc n, \u2202\u03bd n]}. (19)\n\u2022 The gauge-invariant \"Abelian\" dominance (or V dominance) and magnetic monopole dominance (constructed\nfrom V ) in quark confinement have been confirmed at\nT = 0 (and \u03bcq = 0) by comparing string tensions calculated from the Wilson loop average by numerical simulations by [44] for SU(2) and by [46] for SU(3). Here\nit should be remarked that the \"Abelian\" dominance is\nthe dominance for the vacuum expectation value (or average):\nhWC [A ]i \u2243 hWC [V ]i,\n\nhL[A ]i \u2243 hL[V ]i.\n\n(20)\n\nNext, we pay attention to the role played by the remaining field X .\n\u2022 In the absence of dynamical quarks (corresponding\nto the limit mq = \u221e of QCD, i.e., gluodynamics),\nX\u03bcA decouple in the low-energy regime as the correlator\nX\u03bcA (x)X\u03bcA (y) behaves like a massive correlator with\nmass MX . In fact, numerical simulations demonstrate\nfor G = SU (2) and D = 4 [45]\nMX = 1.2 \u223c 1.3 GeV.\n\n(21)\n\nWe can understand this result as follows. The field X\u03bc\ncan acquire the (gauge-invariant) mass dynamically. This\ncomes from a fact that, in sharp contrast to the field A\u03bc ,\na \"gauge-invariant mass term\" for X\u03bc can be introduced\n1 2 A\nM X (x)X\u03bcA (x),\n2 X \u03bc\n\n(22)\n\nsince X\u03bcA (x)X\u03bcA (x) is a gauge-invariant operator. Moreover, this mass term can originate from a vacuum condensation of \"mass dimension-2\", X\u03bdB (x)X\u03bdB (x) 6= 0\nas proposed in [55]. In fact, this condensation can be\ngenerated through self-interactions O(X 4 ) among X\u03bc\n2\ngluons, MX\n\u2243 X\u03bdB (x)X\u03bdB (x) , as examined in [40, 42].\nIt is instructive to remark that the value (21) agrees with\nthe earlier result of the off-diagonal \"gluon mass\" MA in\nthe Maximally Abelian (MA) gauge [60] for SU (2) case,\nMA \u2243 1.2 GeV. See [61] for SU (3) case, MA \u2243 1.1 GeV.\nIn MA gauge, it was shown that even at finite temperatures Abelian dominance (diagonal part dominance and\noff-diagonal part suppression) holds for the spatial propagation of gluons in the long distance greater than 0.4fm.\nIt was observed that the diagonal gluon correlator largely\nchanges between the confinement and the deconfinement\nphase, while the off-diagonal gluon correlator is almost\nthe same even in the deconfinement phase [62]. Although\nthe similar results are expected to hold in our formulation, this observation must be checked directly, as will be\nconfirmed in [63].\n\u2022 In the presence of dynamical quarks (mq < \u221e), X\u03bcA\nis responsible for chiral-symmetry breaking in the following sense. We consider to integrate out the field X\u03bcA in\na naive way. This helps us to obtain an intuitive and\n\nqualitative understanding for the interplay between the\nchiral symmetry breaking and confinement. Later, this\nintegration procedure will be reconsidered from the viewpoint of the renormalization group to obtain a systematic\nimprovement of the result.\nHere we neglect O(X 3 ) and O(X 4 ) terms, which will\nbe taken into account later. Then the integration over\nX\u03bcA can be achieved by the Gaussian integration according to [40]. Consequently, a nonlocal 4 fermioninteraction is generated:\nQCD\nglue\ngNJL\nSeff\n=Seff\n+ Seff\n,\nZ\n\u22121\nglue\n(F\u03bc\u03bd [V ])2\nSeff\n:= dD x\n4\ni\nAB\n+ ln det Q[V ]AB\n,\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 i ln det G[V ]\n2\nZ\n\ngNJL\nSeff\n:=\n\ndD x \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc [V ] \u2212 m\u0302q + i\u03b3 0 \u03bc)\u03c8\nZ\nZ\ng2\n\u03bd\n+ dD x dD y JA\u03bc (x)Q\u22121 [V ]AB\n\u03bc\u03bd (x, y)JB (y),\n2\n(23)\n\nglue\nwhere the last term \u2212 ln det GAB in Seff\ncomes from\nthe Faddeev-Popov determinant associated with the reduction condition (12) (see [39] for the precise form).\nThis is a nonlocal version of a gauged NJL model (realized after Fierz transformation). The chiral-symmetry\nbreaking/restoration transition and the phase structure\nof a local version of gauge NJL models were first studied by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the ladder approximation for QED-like [64\u201366] (see [67] for a\nreview) and QCD-like [68] running gauge coupling constant. They are confirmed later by a systematic approach\nof the renormalization group [69].\nThe range of the nonlocality is determined by the correlation length \u03be, which is characteristic of the color exchange through gluon fields. Therefore, this correlation\nlength \u03be is identified with the inverse of the effective mass\n\u22121\n. In fact, (Q\u22121 )AB\nMX , i.e., \u03be \u2243 MX\n\u03bc\u03bd (x, y) is the X field\ncorrelator, see (3).\nIn other words, MX is identified with the ultraviolet\ncutoff \u039b below which the effective NJL model appears\nand works well. Interesting enough, MX is nearly equal\nto the ultraviolet cutoff adopted in the NJL model\np\np2 . \u039b4 = 1.4GeV, |p| . \u039b3 = 0.6GeV,\n(24)\n\nsee [14].\nWe can decompose the gauge field A\u03bc into the the lowenergy (light) mode p < MX and high-energy (heavy)\nmode p > MX :\n\n2\n2\nA\u03bc (p) =A\u03bc (p)\u03b8(MX\n\u2212 p2 ) + A\u03bc (x)\u03b8(p2 \u2212 MX\n). (25)\n\nIn the above treatment, X\u03bc (p) is supposed to have only\nthe high-energy mode. The low-energy mode, if any, will\nbe responsible for the vacuum condensation [40]. For\nthe precise understanding, we need the renormalization\ngroup treatment as given later and the implications for\nthe nonlocal NJL model will be discussed there.\n\n\f6\nIII.\n\nGLUON SECTOR AND GAUGE FIXING\n\nThe Polyakov loop operator L and the chiral operator\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 are gauge-invariant quantities. Therefore, their average do not depend on the gauge-fixing procedure adopted\nin the calculation. We can choose a gauge in which the\nactual calculation becomes easier than other gauges.\nIn what follows, we treat the time-component V0\nand space-component Vj of V\u03bc differently to consider\nthe finite-temperature case. We consider the following\nPolyakov gauge modified for new variables in our reformulation. If the color field nA (x) is uniform in time,\n\u22020 nA (x) = 0 \u21d4 nA (x) = nA (x),\n\n(26)\n\nthen V0 reduces to\nV0A (x) = c0 (x)nA (x) (A = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(27)\n\nMoreover, if c0 (x) is uniform in time,\n\u22020 c0 (x) = 0 \u21d4 c0 (x) = c0 (x),\n\n(28)\n\n(A = 1, 2, 3),\n\nV0A (x) =c0 (x)\u03b4 A3 , c0 (x) = g \u22121 T \u03c6 + v0 (x),\nVjA (x) =0 + vjA (x),\n\nAB\nQAB\ng\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03bc\u03bd = G\n\nG\n(29)\n\nwhich satisfies\n\n(36)\n\nsuch that hc0 (x)i = g \u22121 T h\u03c6i + hv0 (x)i = g \u22121 T h\u03c6i with\nhv0 (x)i = 0 and hvjA (x)i = 0. Here the prefactor g \u22121 T =\n(g\u03b2)\u22121 was introduced just for the purpose of simplifying\nthe expression of the Polyakov loop, see (41).\n(3) We take into account the expansion up to quadratic\nin the fluctuation fields v0 and vj , which we call the\nquadratic approximation.\nIn the calculation of QAB\n\u03bc\u03bd , if we neglect all fluctuation fields v0 and vj , namely, V0A (x) = g \u22121 T \u03c6\u03b4 A3 and\nC\nVjA (x) = 0, then we can put F\u03bc\u03bd\n[V ] = 0 in QAB\n\u03bc\u03bd , and\nAB\nQ\u03bc\u03bd is diagonal in the Lorentz indices:\nAB\n\nthen V0 reduces to\nV0A (x) = c0 (x)nA (x)\n\nwhich is not time-independent, \u22020 VjA (x) 6= 0.\n(2) We expand the theory around the non-trivial uniform background g \u22121 T \u03c6\u03b4 A3 for the time-component V0A ,\nwhile the trivial background for space-components VjA :2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b4 AB \u2202\u03bc2\n\n(37)\n+ (\u03b4\n\nAB\n\n\u2212\u03b4\n\nA3 B3\n\n\u03b4\n\n2\n\n)(T \u03c6) + 2\u01eb\n\nAB3\n\nT \u03c6\u22020 .\n\nIn this approximation, we have\nGAB = \u2212\u03b4 AB \u2202l2 \u2212 D0AC [V ]D0CB [V ],\n\n(38)\n\nwith\n\n\u22020 V0A (x) = 0 (A = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(30)\n\n\u2212D0AC [V ]D0CB [V ] = \u2212 \u03b4 AB \u220202 + 2\u01ebAB3 T \u03c6\u22020\n\n+ (\u03b4 AB \u2212 \u03b4 A3 \u03b4 B3 )(T \u03c6)2 .\n\nIn this setting, Vj are given by\nVjA (x) = cj (x)nA (x) + g \u22121 \u01ebABC \u2202j nB (x)nC (x). (31)\n\nglue\nThus we rewrite the gluon part Seff\n[V ] as\nglue\nSeff\n[V ]\nZ\n1\n= \u03b2 d3 xV0 (x)(\u2212\u2202j \u2202j )V0 (x)\n2\nZ\n1\n+\nd4 xVTA (x){\u2212\u03b4 AB \u2202l2 \u2212 \u03b4 AB \u220202 }VTB (x)\n2\nZ\n1\nd4 xVLA (x){\u2212\u03b4 AB \u220202 }VLB (x),\n+\n2\ni\nAB\n+ ln det Q[V ]AB\n,\n(40)\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 i ln det G[V ]\n2\n\n(1) In order to simplify the calculation of the Polyakov\nline, we adopt the Polyakov gauge in which the gauge\nfield is diagonal and time-independent: for the background field V0A (x),\nV0A (x) = c0 (x)\u03b4 A3 ,\n\n(32)\n\n\u22020 V0A (x) = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nwhich leads to\n\nThis is realized, if we take the gauge\n\n1\n\nnA (x) = \u03b4 A3 .\n\n(34)\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse temperature \u03b2 := 1/T , and VT and\nVL denote the transverse and longitudinal components of\nV\u03bc respectively.\n\nIn this gauge, the space-component reads\nVjA (x) = cj (x)\u03b4 A3 .\n\n1\n\n(35)\n\nThis is an oversimplified choice for the color field n(x). By\nthis choice, we can not separate the non-perturbative contribution coming from topological configurations such as magnetic\nmonopole. It is desirable to take into account color field degrees\nof freedom explicitly to see the effect of magnetic monopole in\nthe confinement/deconfinement transition.\n\n2\n\nI have assumed that the spatial component of V\u03bc has a trivial background. In view of logical consistency, one must expand\nthe spatial and temporal components around non-trivial backgrounds, and then one must search for the minima of the effective\npotential calculated as a function of two variables, i.e., the temporal and spatial backgrounds. In this paper, it is assumed that\na minimum is realized at vanishing spatial background and that\nthe neglection of the spatial background does not so much affect\nthe confinement/deconfinement transition temperature. Indeed,\nit must be checked whether this assumption is good or not.\n\n\f7\nIV.\n\nPOLYAKOV LOOP\n\nFor G = SU (2), the Polyakov loop operator L(x) =\nL[V0 (x, *)] is defined by\n1\nL(x) := tr(P ),\n2\n\"\n\nP (x) :=P exp ig\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2=1/T\n\n0\n\n\u03c3A\ndx0 V0A (x, x0 )\n2\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere P P \u2020 = 1 and det P = 1. In the above gauge\nchoice,\nh\n\u03c3A i\n.\nP (x) = exp ig\u03b2c0 (x)nA (x)\n2\n\nAfter a suitable (t-independent) gauge transformation,\nthe color field nA (x) is eliminated:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\ng\u03b2c0 (x)\n\u03c33 i\n1\n) = cos\n.\nL(x) = tr(exp ig\u03b2c0 (x)\n2\n2\n2\n(42)\nOwing to periodicity and center symmetry, we can\nrestrict the Polyakov loop average to hLi \u2265 0 for\nG = SU (2). Then the Polyakov loop average hL[V ]i\nis bounded from above by L[hV0 (x, *)i]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\u03c6i\n0 \u2264 hL[V0 (x, *)]i \u2264 L[hV0 (x, *)i] = cos\n, (43)\n2\n\nwhere we have only to consider the range 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0.\nThis inequality follows from the Jensen inequality, since\ncos(x) is concave for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 \u03c0/2, see [31].\nIn the case of mq = \u221e, if the center-symmetry is broken hLi > 0, namely, deconfinement takes place, then the\nvacuum (as a minimum of the effective potential Veff (\u03c6))\nis realized at h\u03c6i < \u03c0. If the vacuum is realized at\nh\u03c6i = \u03c0, then the center-symmetry is restored hLi = 0,\nnamely, confinement occurs. The relation (42) yields the\nrelationship for the average between the gauge field and\nthe Polyakov loop operator:\nharccos L(x)i =\n\ng\u03b2hc0 (x)i\nh\u03c6i\n=\n,\n2\n2\n\n(44)\n\nwhere the left-hand side is the average of an gaugeinvariant object (since L is gauge invariant) and happens\nto agree with the average hV03 i of the gauge field in the\nPolyakov gauge. It is also shown [31] that the converse\nis true: In the center-symmetry-restored phase, h\u03c6i = \u03c0,\nsince\n\u03c0\nh\u03c6i\n= harccos L(x)i = arccoshL(x)i = .\n2\n2\n\n(45)\n\nTherefore, hV0 i or h\u03c6i in the Polyakov gauge gives\na direct physical interpretation as an order parameter for the confinement/deconfinement (order-disorder)\nphase transition. The effective potential Ueff (hLi) of the\nPolyakov loop average hLi could be different from the\n\neffective potential Veff (hV0 i) of the gauge field average\nhV0 i in the following sense. Although both potentials\ngive the same critical temperature Td as a boundary between hLi = 0 and hLi 6= 0, the value of the effective\npotential Ueff (hL[V0 ]i) does not necessarily agree with\nUeff (L[hV0 i]) = Veff (hV0 i) at a given temperature T , since\nwe have only an inequality hL[V0 ]i \u2264 L[hV0 i]. This difference could affect the critical exponent and other physical\nquantities of interest. Therefore, the result obtained from\nVeff (hV0 i) must be carefully examined.\nV. DERIVING THE\nCONFINEMENT/DECONFINEMENT\nTRANSITION\n\nIn this section, we restrict our consideration to the pure\nglue\nglue case. We show that the pure gluon part Sef\nf can describe confinement/deconfinement transition signaled by\nthe Polyakov loop average hLi. In this section, we completely follow two remarkable papers by Marhauser and\nPawlowski [31] and by Braun, Gies and Pawlowski [32],\nwhich succeeded to show the transition for the first time\nbased on the functional renormalization group (FRG).

Here STr denotes the super-trace\nintroduced to include both commutative field (gluon) and\nanticommutative field (quark, ghost). See [28, 29] for\nreviews of the functional renormalization group.\nIf we restrict our consideration to the pure glue case\nSYM under the gauge nA (x) = \u03b4 A3 , then the relevant\nfields \u03a6 are V\u03bcA (x) , X\u03bcA (x) and FP ghosts (ghost and\nantighost) C A (x), C \u0304A (x), i.e., \u03a6\u2020 = (V\u03bcA , X\u03bcA , C A , C \u0304A ).\nIn this section, we use the Euclidean formulation.

UNDERSTANDING THE EXISTENCE OF\nCONFINEMENT TRANSITION ACCORDING TO\nTHE LANDAU-GINZBURG ARGUMENT\n\nIn this section, we show that some qualitative aspects\nof the deconfinement/confinement transition found in the\nprevious section can be understood without detailed numerical works, although the precise value of the transition temperature Td cannot be determined without them.\nFor G = SU (2) in the pure Yang-Mills limit mq \u2192\n\u221e, the effective potential Vglue (L) for the Polyakov\nloop L must be invariant under the center symmetry\nZ(2). Therefore, Vglue (L) is an even function of L, i.e.,\nVglue (L) = Vglue (\u2212L) where L is real-valued L = L\u2217 .\nThus the Landau-Ginzburg argument suggests that the\nglue\neffective potential Veff\n(L) for G = SU (2) has the powerseries expansion in L near the transition point L = 0:\nglue\nVeff\n(L) = c0 +\n\nc2 2 c4 4\nL + L + O(L6 ).\n2\n4\n\n(66)\n\nAs the vacuum is specified as minima of the effective potential, the confinement/deconfinement transition temperature Td is determined from the condition c2 (Td ) = 0\nso that the low-temperature (T < Td ) confinement phase\nhLi = 0 is realized for c2 (T ) > 0, while the hightemperature (T > Td ) deconfinement phase hLi =\n6 0\nis realized for c2 (T ) < 0, provided that the positivity\nc4 (T ) > 0 is maintained across the transition temperature. Consequently, the transition is of the 2nd order.\nIndeed, we confirm that the Landau-Ginzburg\ndescription is correct and valid for the confinement/deconfinement transition, by making use of the\nflow equation given in the previous section. This is a\nmicroscopic justification of the Landau-Ginzburg argument for the confinement/deconfinement transition. In\nour treatment, however, it is more convenient to write\nglue\nthe effective potential Veff\nin terms of the angle variable \u03c6 (rather than L) around the transition point \u03c6 = \u03c0\n(instead of L = 0). Defining \u03c6\u0303 := \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0, we find that\nglue\nglue\nglue\nVeff\n(\u03c6\u0303) must be an even function Veff\n(\u03c6\u0303) = Veff\n(\u2212\u03c6\u0303)\ndue to the center symmetry and hence odd terms (e.g.,\n\u03c6\u0303, \u03c6\u03033 ) do not appear:\nglue\nVeff\n(\u03c6\u0303) = C0 +\n\nC2 2 C4 4\n\u03c6\u0303 +\n\u03c6\u0303 + O(\u03c6\u03036 ).\n2\n4!\n\n(67)\n\nAt sufficiently high temperature, we observe that\nglue\nC2 (T ) < 0 and hence Veff\nhas the minimum at \u03c6\u0303 6= 0\n(\u21d0\u21d2 L 6= 0) leading to deconfinement. In order to\nshow the existence of the confinement/deconfinement\ntransition at T = Td , C2 (T ) must change the signature\nC2 (T ) > 0 below this temperature T < Td and hence\nthe minimum occurs at \u03c6\u0303 = 0 (\u21d0\u21d2 L = 0) leading to\n\nconfinement. Therefore, the confinement/deconfinement\ntemperature Td is determined by C2 (Td ) = 0, provided\nthat the positivity C4 (T ) > 0 is maintained.\nFor this purpose, we study the scale dependent effecglue\ntive potential Veff,k\nat k > 0\nC2,k 2 C4,k 4\n\u03c6\u0303 +\n\u03c6\u0303 + O(\u03c6\u03036 ),\n(68)\n2\n4!\nand see how it evolves towards the limit k \u2192 0 according to the flow equation to obtain the physical effective\nglue\nglue\npotential Veff\n:= Veff,k=0\n.\nglue\nVeff,k\n= C0,k +\n\nglue\nAs in (56), Veff,k\nis decomposed into two pieces:\nglue\nVeff,k\n= V\u0302T,k\u0302 + \u2206V\u0302k\u0302 ,\n\n(69)\n\nwhere we have defined the dimensionless potential according to the rescaling (63). The first part V\u0302T,k\u0302 is the\n(k-dependent) perturbative part (52) obtained essentially\nby the one-loop calculation with the regulator function\nRk being included.

The temperature is distinguished by k\u0302c ranging from the smallest value at the highest\ntemperature T = 1.0GeV to the largest value at the lowest\ntemperature T = 0.001 GeV where \u03b7k \u2243 \u22121 for k\u0302 < k\u0302c and\n\u03b7k \u2243 0 for k\u0302 > k\u0302c . The discontinuity of the derivative seen at\nk\u0302c is due to the same reason as that explained in Fig. 6 and\nis not essential to see qualitative behaviors of the solution of\nthe flow equation.\n\nWe can understand qualitatively why a 2nd order\nphase transition from the deconfinement phase to the\nconfinement phase can occur by lowering the temperature.\nThe flow starts from a2,k = 0 and hence C2,k =\nA2,k + a2,k < 0 (because of A2,k < 0) at k = \u039b \u226b 1.\nWe assume C4,k = A4,k + a4,k > 0 for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u039b, as a\nnecessary condition for realizing a 2nd order transition.\nOtherwise, we must consider the higher-order terms, e.g.\nO(\u03c66 ).

(The upper panel) \u03b1k as functions\nof k. (The lower panel) \u03b1k as functions of k\u0302. For a given\ntemperature, there is a critical value k\u0302c separating the deep\nIR region (76) from the higher momentum region (75). The\ndiscontinuity of the derivative seen at k\u0302c comes from a crude\napproximation in which we have taken into account just the\nfirst linear term (i.e., c1 = c2 = * * * = 0) in the expansion (76),\nand can be avoided if we take into account higher order terms\nas explained below (76). However, this is not essential to see\nqualitative behaviors of the solution of the flow equation.\n\nThen the right-hand side of (73) is negative, since the\nrunning coupling constant \u03b1k is positive and 1 + 51 \u03b7k\nis positive, see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Consequently, a2,k\nstarted at zero becomes positive a2,k > 0 just below \u039b\nand increases (monotonically) as k decreases. See Fig. 8.\nk\n(A2,k +\nNote that the denominator can vanish 1 + 4\u03c0\u03b1\nk\u03022\n\u2217\na2,k ) = 0 at some k (since C2,k = A2,k + a2,k < 0 or\n0 < a2,k < \u2212A2,k ) where the right-hand side of (73)\nbecomes negative infinity and a2,k blows up there. To\navoid this pathology and to obtain the solution all the\nway down to the limit k \u2192 0, a2,k must grow relatively\nrapidly so that |A2,k + a2,k | \u226a 1 towards the limit k \u2192 0.\nAn important observation of the flow equation (73) is\nthat the explicit temperature-dependence comes from the\nrunning coupling constant alone. At zero temperature,\nthe running coupling constant is well parameterized by\n\n\f12\nthe fitting function [72]:\n\u03b1k =\n\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 0.709/Nc\n,\nln[e + a1 (k 2 )a2 + b1 (k 2 )b2 ]\n\na`k\n0.4\n\n(74)\n\nwhere a1 = 5.292, a2 = 2.324, b1 = 0.034, b2 = 3.169.\nin units of GeV.\nFor the perturbative region k \u226b T , i.e., k\u0302 \u226b 1, we\nadopt this form: k 2 = T 2 k\u0302 2 ,\ng2\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 0.709/Nc\n\u03b1k = k =\n.\n4\u03c0\nln[e + a1 (T 2 k\u0302 2 )a2 + b1 (T 2 k\u0302 2 )b2 ]\n\n(75)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n4\n\n2\n-A`k\n0.4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n`\nk =k\u0090T\n\nak`\n\n0.3\n\nFor the nonperturbative region k < 2\u03c0T , i.e., k\u0302 < O(1),\nwe adopt the running coupling which is governed by an\ninfrared fixed point [71]\n\u0012 \u00133\n\u0012 \u00132\nk\nk\n\u2217 k\n+ c2\n+ ***\n\u03b1k =\u03b13d + c1\nT\nT\nT\n=\u03b1\u22173d k\u0302 + c1 k\u0302 2 + c2 k\u0302 3 + * * * ,\n\n`\nA coefficient a`k of j2 in DVT,k`\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n(76)\n\nwhere coefficients c1 , c2 , ... are determined such that the\ncoupling at zero temperature (75) and its derivative with\nrespect to k are connected continuously with this ansatz\n(76) at the scale set by the lowest non-vanishing bosonic\nMatsubara-mode \u03c9 = 2\u03c0T . However, the running coupling constant at small momenta (76) does not contribute\nto the explicit T -dependence in the scaled flow equation, since it is written in terms of the scaled k\u0302 alone\nand hence denoted by a common curve going through\nthe origin for any temperature T in the second figure of\nFig. 6. Therefore, the running coupling at very small\nmomentum region can not be responsible for the confinement/deconfinement transition at finite temperature, if\nthis observation is correct. As can be seen from the second figure of Fig. 6, the dominant contribution comes\nfrom the intermediate momentum region above O(1)\nGeV. Thus, we can avoid the issue of gauge-fixing artifact in the deep IR region due to Gribov copies in the\nzero-temperature case, see e.g. [73, 74] and reference\ntherein.\nWe consider a solution of the reduced (or normalized)\nflow equation as a function of k\u0302, rather than k, for a given\ntemperature T . Then the difference between high and\nlow temperature phases attributes to the behavior of the\nrunning coupling constant \u03b1k as a function of k = T k\u0302,\nwhich brings the explicit T dependence to the reduced\nflow equation. In the case of high-temperature T \u226b 1,\nk = T k\u0302 becomes large for a wide range of k\u0302 and the\nrunning coupling constant \u03b1k remains relatively small.\nThe resulting slow increase of a2,k keeps a2,k small such\nthat C2,k = A2,k + a2,k < 0 or a2,k < \u2212A2,k even at\nk = 0. This leads to the center symmetry breaking at\nhigh-temperature.\nIn the case of low temperature T \u226a 1, k = T k\u0302 becomes small for the same range of k\u0302 and the running\ncoupling constant \u03b1k gets into the intermediate region\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n`\nk =k\u0090T\n\nFIG. 8: a2,k vs. \u2212A2,k as functions of k\u0302 for T < Td .\n\nof O(1) GeV rapidly and becomes larger as the temperature becomes smaller. At sufficiently low temperature,\na2,k increases in decreasing k\u0302 so rapidly that a2,k eventually reaches to the point A2,k + a2,k = 0 or a2,k = \u2212A2,k\nat a certain value k\u0302 = k\u03020 . In other words, the graph of\na2,k intersects with that of \u2212A2,k at k\u0302 = k\u03020 . In the region\n0 < k < k0 where C2,k = A2,k +a2,k > 0 or a2,k > \u2212A2,k ,\nthe flow equation reads\n\u2202k\u0302 a2,k \u2243 \u2212\n\n(1 + 51 \u03b7k ) (A4,k + a4,k )k\u0302 4\n,\n6\u03c0 2\n4\u03c0\u03b1k (A2,k + a2,k )2\n\n(77)\n\nthe right-hand-side gets small negative, and a2,k becomes\nflat near the IR limit. See Fig. 8. Finally, a2,k reaches the\nvalue realizing C2,k = A2,k + a2,k > 0 or a2,k > \u2212A2,k at\nk = 0. This leads to the recovery of the center symmetry.\nThe difference is clearly seen from the second figure of\nFig. 6 where the running gauge coupling \u03b1k is drawn as\na function of k\u0302 for various temperatures.\nIn our treatment, the difference between the threedimensional RG scale kT and the four-dimensional one\nk is neglected by equating two scales kT = k just for simplifying the analysis, since it is enough for obtaining a\nqualitative understanding for the transition. This is not\nbe the case for obtaining quantitative results, see Appendix C of [31] for the precise treatment on this issue.\nVII.\n\nQUARK PART AND GAUGED\nNONLOCAL NJL MODEL\n\nSint =\nR We\nRexamine the quark self-interaction part\n\u03bdB\ndD x dD y 21 J \u03bcA (x)g 2 (Q\u22121 [V ])AB\n(y).

Although the Fierz transformation induces mixings and recombinations among\noperators, the resulting theory must maintain the symmetries of the original QCD Lagrangian.

The regulator function Rk introduces a\nmass proportional to k 2 , which plays a similar role to M02\nin the above, as long as k > 0.\nThe NJL model [12] is well known as a low-energy\neffective theory of QCD to describe the dynamical\nbreaking of chiral symmetry in QCD (at least in the\nconfinement phase), see e.g.\n[13, 14].\nThe theQCD\nglue\ngNJL\nory given above by Seff\n= Seff + Seff\nis able\nto describe chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration and\nquark confinement/deconfinement on an equal footing\nglue\nwhere the pure gluon part Seff\ndescribes confinement/deconfinement transition signaled by the Polyakov\nloop average. We can incorporate the information on confinement/deconfinement transition into the quark sector\nthrough the covariant derivative D[V ] and the nonlocal\nNJL interaction G (G and C), in sharp contrast to the\nconventional PNJL model where the entanglement between chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration and confinement/deconfinement was incorporated through the covariant derivative D[V ] alone and the nonlocal NJL interaction G is fixed to the zero-temperature case. In our\ntheory, the nonlocal NJL interaction G (G and C) is automatically determined through the information of confinement/deconfinement dictated by the Polyakov loop\nL (non-trivial gluon background), while in the nonlocal\nPNJL model [22] the low-momentum (non-perturbative)\nbehavior of C was not controlled by first principles and\nwas provided by the instanton model.\nTo study chiral dynamics, it is convenient to bosonize\nthe gauged nonlocal NJL model as done [22].

IMPLICATIONS OF THE POLYAKOV\nLOOP FOR CHIRAL-SYMMETRY BREAKING\nAT FINITE TEMPERATURE\n\nThe thermodynamics of QCD can be studied based on\nour effective theory derived in this paper in the similar\n\n\f15\nway to the nonlocal PNJL model [22]. But this must be\ndone by including the effect of gluon properly. In the\nPNJL model, the effect of the gluon was introduced by\nthe standard minimal gauge coupling procedure, i.e., replacing the normal derivative \u2202\u03bc by the covariant derivative D\u03bc [A ] := \u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc . In our effective theory, the effect of the gluon is introduced through the NJL coupling\nconstant G and the nonlocality function C, in addition\nto the minimal coupling D\u03bc [V ]. The nonlocal NJL interaction among quarks are mediated by gluons at finite\ntemperature in QCD. Therefore, both G and C characterizing nonlocal NJL interaction inevitably have temperature dependence, which could be different depending\non whether quarks are in confinement or deconfinement\nphases.\nAt T = 0, QCD must be in the hadron phase where the\nchiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, which means\nthat the NJL coupling constant G(0) at zero temperature\nmust be greater than the critical NJL coupling constant\nGc :\nG(0) = g 2\n\n1\n> Gc .\nM02\n\n(100)\n\nG(T ) is (monotonically) decreasing as the temperature\nT increases, it becomes smaller than the critical NJL\ncoupling constant\nG(0) = g 2\n\n1\ng2 1\ng2\n, G\u0303(0) =\n,\n2\n2\n2 p + M0\n2 M02\n\nG(T\u03c7 ) \u2261\n\nM02\n.\np2 + M02\n\n(102)\n\nAs an immediate outcome of our effective theory, this\ndetermines the temperature-dependence of the coupling\nconstant G of nonlocal NJL model.

Below the deconfinement temperature\nTd\u2217 , i.e., T < Td\u2217 , therefore, L \u2243 0 or \u03c6 \u2243 \u03c0, the NJL\ncoupling constant G has the temperature-dependence\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2M02\n1\nG(T )/G(0) \u2243\n+ 1 (T < Td\u2217 ).

This is\nreasonable since the form factor is nearly equal to the X\ncorrelator Q\u22121 , as already mentioned in sec. II.\nFor more precise treatment, we must obtain the full\neffective potential Veff (\u03c3, \u03c6) as a function of two order\nparameters \u03c3 (or h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i) and \u03c6 (or hLi), and look for a\nset of values (\u03c3, \u03c6) = (\u03c30 , \u03c60 ) at which the minimum\nVeff (\u03c30 , \u03c60 ) of Veff (\u03c3, \u03c6) is realized. Then \u03c6 must be replaced by \u03c60 in the above consideration. For this goal,\nwe must develop the RG treatment for the full theory.\nThis issue will be studied in a subsequent paper.\n\n\f16\nIX. HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE\nENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN CONFINEMENT\nAND CHIRAL SYMMETRY BREAKING\n\nTo discuss the entanglement between confinement and\nchiral symmetry breaking, we wish to obtain the total\neffective potential V QCD of QCD written in terms of two\norder parameters, i.e., the Polyakov loop average hLi and\nchiral condensate h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i, so that its minima determine the\nvacuum for a given set of parameters mq , T and \u03bcq when\nNc and Nf are fixed. Here mq \u2191 \u221e is the pure Yang-Mills\nlimit and mq \u2193 0 is the chiral limit.\nThe effective potential for the quark part is obtained by\nintegrating out quark degrees of freedom. The simplest\nform is obtained e.g., from the bosonized model as\nV quark\no\nn\n1 2\n= \u2212 Tr ln i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + mq + C\u03c3 \u2212 gA4 \u03b3 4 + i\u03bcq \u03b3 4 +\n\u03c3 .\n2G\n(110)\nThen the RG-scale k dependent effective potential Vkquark\nfor the quark part must be given as the solution of the\nflow equation. In the same approximation as the above,\nit is written in terms of two order parameters \u03c3 and \u03c6:\nVkquark (\u03c3, \u03c6)mq ,T,\u03bcq\nh\nX Z d3 p\n=\u2212T\ntr\nln\ni\u03c9n \u03b3 0 \u2212 pj \u03b3 j + mq + C(p)\u03c3\n(2\u03c0)3\nn\u2208Z\n\n+\n\n\u2212 T \u03c6T3 \u03b3 4 + i\u03bcq \u03b3 4 + Rkquark\n\n1 2\n\u03c3 ,\n2G\n\ni\n\n(111)\n\nwhere T3 = \u03c33 /2 and Rkquark is the regulator function for\nquarks. In the limit k \u2193 0, indeed, Vkquark (111) reduces\nto V quark (110). The effective potential Vkquark (111) depends on mq , T and \u03bcq when N c and Nf are fixed. Due\nto the p0 dependence of the \"mass\" function M (p) which\nis an immediate consequence of the nonlocality of the\npresent NJL model, it is difficult to obtain the closed\nanalytical form by performing the summation over the\nMatsubara frequencies.\nQCD\nIn our strategy, a full effective potential Veff,k\n(\u03c3, \u03c6) of\nQCD is given by summing three parts:\nQCD\nVeff,k\n(\u03c3, \u03c6) = Vkglue (\u03c6) + Vkquark (\u03c3, \u03c6) + \u2206VkQCD (\u03c3, \u03c6),\n(112)\nwith the pure gluon part Vkglue (\u03c6) = VT,k (56),\n\nVkglue (\u03c6) =Tr{ln[GAB + \u03b4 AB Rk ]},\n=Tr{ln[\u2212\u03b4 AB \u2202\u03bc2 + (\u03b4 AB \u2212 \u03b4 A3 \u03b4 B3 )(T \u03c6)2\n+ 2\u01ebAB3 T \u03c6\u22020 + \u03b4 AB Rk ]},\n\n(113)\n\nthe quark part (111),\nVkquark (\u03c3, \u03c6) =\n\n1 2\n\u03c3 \u2212 Tr ln{i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + mq + C\u03c3 \u2212 T \u03c6T3 \u03b3 4\n2G\n+ i\u03bcq \u03b3 4 + Rkquark },\n(114)\n\nand a non-perturbative part \u2206VkQCD (\u03c3, \u03c6) induced in the\nRG evolution according to a flow equation.

Therefore, the QCD effective potential includes\nthe explicitly center-symmetry-breaking term. For G =\nSU (2), the center symmetry \u03c6\u0303 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6\u0303 is explicitly broken as C1 6= 0, C3 6= 0 in V g (\u03c6) and F1 6= 0 in V c (\u03c3, \u03c6).\nThe existence of the cross term is important to understand the entanglement between center symmetry and\nchiral symmetry, as pointed out by [19]. In fact, the\none-loop calculation leads to C1 = 0.97434Nf > 0 and\nF1 = \u22120.106103Nf < 0 (\u03bcq = 0 case) which appears to\nbe a good indication for this purpose and serves as the\ninitial condition in solving the flow equation.\nIn the paper by Schaefer, Pawlowski and Wambach\n[26], a sort of back-reaction from quarks has been introduced to improve the effective potential of the Polyakov\nloop, while the NJL coupling remains local. In contrast,\nthis paper introduces a back-reaction from gluons to improve the NJL interaction, leading to the nonlocal NJL\ncoupling. However, this does not mean that two treatments are considered to be alternative. In the presence\n\n\f17\nof dynamical quarks, the running coupling \u03b1 is changed\ndue to fermionic contributions. In [26], this effect has\nbeen taken into account as a modification of the expansion coefficient in the effective potential of the Polyakov\nloop, resulting in e.g., the Nf flavor-dependent deconfinement temperature Td (Nf ). Remembering that the input\nof our analysis is just a running coupling, a sort of backreaction from quarks considered in [26] is easily included\ninto our framework by using the running coupling modified by quark contributions. Thus, the treatment in this\npaper is already able to take into account back-reactions\nfrom quarks and gluons mentioned above.\nThis section is a sketch of our strategy of understanding the entanglement between center symmetry and chiral symmetry. The detailed analysis will be given in a\nsubsequent paper. 3\n\nX.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a reformulation\nof QCD and suggested a framework for deriving a\nlow-energy effective theory of QCD which enables one\nto study the deconfinement/confinement and chiralsymmetry restoration/breaking crossover transition simultaneously on an equal footing. A resulting low-energy\neffective theory based on this framework can be regarded\nas a modified (improved) version of the nonlocal PNJL\nmodel [22]. In our framework, the basic ingredients are\na reformulation of QCD based on new variables and the\nflow equation of the Wetterich type for the Wilsonian\nrenormalization group.\nA lesson we learned in this study is that a perturbative (one-loop) result can be a good initial condition for\nsolving the flow equation of the renormalization group\nto obtain the non-perturbative result. In gluodynamics,\nrecently, it has been demonstrated [31, 32] that the existence of confinement transition, i.e., recovery of the center symmetry signaled by the vanishing Polyakov loop average can be shown by approaching the phase transition\npoint from the high-temperature deconfinement phase in\nwhich the center symmetry is spontaneously broken. Indeed, the effective potential for the Polyakov loop obtained in the one-loop calculation which we call the Weiss\n\n3\n\nIt is known that appearance of a mixed-term \u03c32 \u03c6\u0303 plays an essential role in the chiral-confinement entanglement. Such a term\nappears in the original PNJL model and leads to the 2 crossovers\nhappening almost simultaneously. In the following paper posted\nto the archive after this paper was submitted for publication, it\nhas been shown that an effective Polyakov loop-dependent fourquark interaction derived by this paper yields stronger correlation between the chiral and deconfinement transitions, making\nT\u03c7 \u223c Td more tightly, than the usual PNJL model.\nY. Sakai, T. Sasaki, H. Kouno and M. Yahiro, Entanglement between deconfinement transition and chiral symmetry restoration,\ne-Print: arXiv:1006.3648 [hep-ph].\n\npotential leads to the non-vanishing Polyakov loop average, i.e., spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry.\nFor gluon sector, to understand the existence of confinement transition by approaching from the deconfinement side, we have given the Landau-Ginzburg description in the neighborhood of the (crossover) phase\ntransition point by analyzing the flow equation of\nthe functional renormalization group. The deconfinement/confinement phase transition is consistent with the\nsecond order transition for G = SU (2), while the first order transition is expected for G = SU (3). The detailed\nstudy of the SU (3) case will be given in a subsequent\npaper.\nThe input for solving the flow equation was just a running gauge coupling constant, in sharp contrast to the\nPNJL model including several parameters. From the\nviewpoint of a first-principle derivation, this is superior to\nphenomenological models with many input parameters.\nFor quark sector, it is possible to obtain the chiralsymmetry breaking/restoration transition from the first\nprinciple. However, we need more hard works, especially,\nto discuss the QCD phase diagram at finite density and\nthe critical endpoint. A possibility in this direction from\nthe first principle of QCD was demonstrated in one-flavor\nQCD based on the FRG [77]. It will be possible to treat\nchiral dynamics and confinement on an equal footing\nbased on our framework along this line [78]. Still, however, we must overcome some technical issues to achieve\nthe goal of understanding full phase structures of QCD.\nThe detailed studies will be hopefully given in a subsequent paper.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 The author would like to thank\nthe Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics at Kyoto\nUniversity where the YITP workshop \"New Frontiers\nin QCD 2010 (NFQCD10)\" was held.
