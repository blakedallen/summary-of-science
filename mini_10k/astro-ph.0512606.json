The new method treats each superstar as a single star and follows the\nevolution and motion of all individual stellar objects.

The results presented are in good agreement with theoretical\nexpectations and the results of other methods. During the evolution, the initial mass function\n(IMF) changes significantly. The local mass function (LMF) around the half\u2013mass radius\nclosely resembles the actual global mass function (GMF). At the late stages of evolution the\nmass of the evolved stars inside the core can be as high as 97% of the total mass in this\nregion. For the whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67% of the total mass. The\nevolution of cluster anisotropy strongly depends on initial cluster concentration, IMF and the\nstrength of the tidal field. The results presented are the first step in the direction of simulating\nthe evolution of real globular clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.\nKey words: gravitation \u2013 methods: numerical \u2013 celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics \u2013 globular clusters: general\n\n1 INTRODUCTION.\nDynamical modeling of real, large stelar systems, like globular\nclusters or galactic nuclei, and understanding their evolution still\nis a great challenge both for the theory and hardware/software. Basically, there are two approaches. Direct N \u2013body method, which\nrequires extremely large hardware requirements and very sophisticated software, and statistical modeling based on the Fokker\u2013\nPlanck and other approximations, which suffers from the poor understanding of the validity of assumptions.\nOn the side of N \u2013body simulations recent years brought a\nsignificant progress in both hardware and software. First, parallel\n(even massively parallel) computing has opened a route to gain\nperformance at relatively low cost and little technological advancement. Secondly, the already successful GRAPE special purpose\ncomputers (Sugimoto et al. 1990, Makino et al. 1997, Makino &\nTaiji 1998, Makino 2002, Makino & Hut 2003) have been developed in their present generation (GRAPE\u20136) and aim at the\n100 Tflops speed. NBODY6++ (Spurzem 1999), the successor of\nAarseth's NBODY6 code has been ported on massively parallel,\ngeneral purpose computers (CRAY T3E and PC clusters) and was\nused for astrophysical problems related to the dissolution of glob\u22c6\n\nE\u2013mail: mig@camk.edu.pl\n\nular clusters (Baumgardt 2001, Baumgardt, Hut & Heggie. 2002)\nand the decay of massive black hole binaries in galactic nuclei after\na merger (Milosavljevic & Merritt 2001, Hemsendorf, Sigurdsson\n& Spurzem 2002). Despite such progresses in hardware and software there is still impossible to model directly evolution of real\nglobular cluster (N \u223c 106 ) and galactic nuclei (N \u223c 109 ). Recent\nwork by Baumgardt et al (2002) and Baumgardt & Makino (2002)\nhas pushed the limits of present direct modeling to about 105 using\nboth NBODY6++ and the GRAPE\u20136 special purpose hardware.\nOn the side of Fokker\u2013Planck method with finite differences\nand an anisotropic gaseous model, recent years brought great improvements. Models can be used now to simulate more realistic\nstellar systems. They can tackle: anisotropy, rotation, a tidal boundary, tidal shocking by galactic disk and bulge, mass spectrum,\nstellar evolution and dynamical and primordial binaries (Louis &\nSpurzem 1991, Giersz & Spurzem 1994, Takahashi 1995, 1996,\n1997, Spurzem 1996, Takahashi & Portegies Zwart 1998, 2000\nhereafter TPZ, Drukier et al 1999, Einsel & Spurzem 1999, Takahashi & Lee 2000, Kim et al. 2002, Kim, Lee & Spurzem 2004,\nFiestas, Spurzem & Kim 2005). Unfortunately, the Fokker\u2013Planck\napproach suffers, among other things, from the uncertainty of differential cross\u2013sections of many processes which are important\nduring cluster evolution. It can not supply detailed information\nabout the formation and movement of all objects present in clus-\n\n\f2\n\nMirek Giersz\n\nters. Additionally, the anisotropic gaseous model assumes a certain\nform of heat conductivity and closure relations between the third\norder moments.\nThere is an elegant alternative to generate models of star clusters, which can correctly reproduce the stochastic features of real\nstar clusters, but without really integrating all orbits directly as in\nan N \u2013body simulation. They rely on the Fokker\u2013Planck approximation and (hitherto) spherical symmetry, but their data structure\nis very similar to an N \u2013body model. These so\u2013called Monte Carlo\nmodels were first presented by H\u00e9non (1971, 1975), Spitzer (1975)\nand later improved by Stod\u00f3\u0142kiewicz (1982, 1985, 1986) and in further work by Giersz (1997, 1998, 2001), and recently by Rasio and\nhis collaborators (Joshi, Rasio & Portegies Zwart 2000, Watters,\nJoshi & Rasio 2000, Joshi, Nave & Rasio 2001, Fregeau et al. 2003,\nG\u00fcrkan, Freitag & Rasio 2004), and Freitag (Freitag 2000, Freitag\n& Benz 2001, 2002). The basic idea is to have pseudo\u2013particles,\nwhich orbital parameters are given in a smooth, self\u2013consistent potential. However, their orbital motion is not explicitly followed; to\nmodel interactions with other particles like two\u2013body relaxation by\ndistant encounters or strong interactions between binaries and other\nobjects, a position of the particle in its orbit, and further free parameters of the individual encounter, are picked from an appropriate\ndistribution by using random numbers. The Monte Carlo scheme\ntakes full advantage of the established physical knowledge about\nthe secular evolution of (spherical) star clusters as inferred from\ncontinuum model simulations. Additionally, it describes in a proper\nway the graininess of the gravitational field and the stochasticity of\nreal N \u2013body systems and provides, in a manner as detailed as in direct N \u2013body simulations, information about the movement of any\nobjects in the system. This does not include any additional physical approximations or assumptions which are common in Fokker\u2013\nPlanck and gas models (e.g. for conductivity). Because of this, the\nMonte Carlo scheme can be regarded as a method which lies between direct N \u2013body and Fokker\u2013Planck models and combines\nmost of their advantages. A hybrid variant of the Monte Carlo\ntechnique combined with a gaseous model has been proposed by\nSpurzem & Giersz (1996), and applied to systems with a large number of primordial binaries by Giersz & Spurzem (2000) and Giersz\n& Spurzem (2003) and for tidally limited systems by Spurzem et\nal (2005). The hybrid method uses a Monte Carlo model for binaries or any other object for which a statistical description, as\nused by the gaseous model, is not appropriate due to small numbers of objects or unknown analytic cross sections for interaction\nprocesses. The method is particularly useful for investigating the\nevolution of large stellar systems with a realistic fraction of primordial binaries, but could also be used in the future to include, for\nexample, the build up of massive stars and blue stragglers by stellar\ncollisions.\nVery detailed observations of globular clusters which are\navailable at present or will become available in future (e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope and the new very large terrestrial telescopes)\nhave extended and will extend our knowledge about their stellar\ncontent, internal dynamics and the influence of the environment on\ncluster evolution (Janes 1991, Djorgovski & Meylan 1993, Smith\n& Brodie 1993, Hut & Makino 1996, Meylan & Heggie 1997).\nThis data covers luminosity functions and derived mass functions,\ncolor\u2013magnitude diagrams, population and kinematical analysis,\nincluding binaries and compact stellar evolution remnants, detailed\ntwo\u2013dimensional proper motion and radial velocity data, and tidal\ntails spanning over arcs several degrees wide (Koch et al. 2004).\nA wealth of information on \"peculiar\" objects in globular clusters\n(blue stragglers, X\u2013ray sources (high\u2013 and low\u2013luminosity), mil-\n\nlisecond pulsars, etc.) suggests a very close interplay between stellar evolution, binary evolution and dynamical interactions. This interplay is far from being understood. Moreover, recent observations\nsuggest that the primordial binary fraction in a globular cluster can\nbe as high as 15% \u2013 38% (Rubenstein & Bailyn 1997), and possible\nexistence of intermediate\u2013mass black holes in the centers of some\nglobular clusters (Gebhardt et al 2000). With all these observational\ndata such as King at al. (1998), Piotto & Zoccali (1999), Rubenstein & Bailyn (1999), Ibata et al. (1999), Piotto et al. (1999), Grillmair et al. (1999), Shara et al. (1998), Odenkirchen et al. (2001),\nHansen et al. (2002), Richer et al. (2002) (to mention only a few\npapers), easily reproducible reliable modelling becomes more important than before. Monte Carlo codes provide all the necessary\nflexibility to disentangle the mutual interactions between all physical processes which are important during globular cluster evolution\nand to perform in a reasonable time, detailed simulations of real\nglobular clusters.\nThe ultimate aim of the project described here is to build a\nMonte Carlo code (in the framework of the MODEST international\ncollaborations, http:/www.manybody.org/modest), which will be\nable to simulate the evolution of real globular clusters, as closely as\npossible. In this paper (the third in the series) the Monte Carlo code\n(which was discussed in detail in Papers I and II) is used to simulate\nthe evolution of stellar systems, which consist of comparable number of stars and have mass comparable to real globular clusters. The\nresults of simulations will be compared with those of Chernoff &\nWeinberg (1990, hereafter CW), Vesperini & Heggie (1997, hereafter VH), Aarseth & Heggie (1998, hereafter AH), Baumgardt &\nMakino (2002) and Lamers et al (2005).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, a short description of processes implemented into the Monte Carlo code will\nbe presented. In Section 3, the initial conditions will be discussed\nand results of the simulation will be shown. And finally, in Section\n4 the conclusions will be presented.\n\n2 MONTE CARLO METHOD.\nThe Monte Carlo method can be regarded as a statistical way of\nsolving the Fokker\u2013Planck equation. Its implementation presented\nin Giersz (1998, hereafter Paper I) and Giersz (2001, hereafter Paper II) is based on the orbit\u2013averaged Monte Carlo method developed in the early seventies by H\u00e9non (1971) and then substantially\nimproved by Stod\u00f3\u0142kiewicz (1986, and references therein), and recently by Giersz (Paper I and II), by Freitag (Freitag & Benz 2001,\n2002) and by Rasio's group (Joshi et al 2000, 2001, Fregeau et\nal 2003, 2004, Fregeau, Chatterjee & Rasio 2005, Freitag, G\u00fcrkan\n& Rasio 2005, Freitag, Rasio & Baumgardt 2005). The code is described in detail in Paper I, which deals with simulations of isolated, single\u2013mass systems and in Paper II in which additional\nphysical processes were included: multi\u2013mass systems and stellar\nevolution, mass loss through the tidal boundary, formation of three\u2013\nbody binaries and their subsequent interactions with field stars, and\ninteractions between binaries.\nFor the sake of completeness, a short description of the main\ningredients of the Monte Carlo model will follow. For more detailed\ndiscussion of the code readers should refer to Paper I and II.\n2.1 Mass Spectrum and Stellar Evolution\nTo facilitate comparison with results of other numerical simulations\nof globular cluster evolution (e.g. CW, Fukushige & Heggie 1995,\n\n\fMONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF STAR CLUSTERS III\nGiersz & Heggie 1997, VH, AH, TPZ, JNR) and for simplicity a\nsingle power\u2013low approximation of IMF was used.\nN (m)dm = Cm\u2212\u03b1 dm,\n\nmmin 6 m 6 mmax ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C and \u03b1 are constants. The mmin , minimum stellar mass\nand mmax , maximum stellar mass were chosen to 0.1M\u2299 and\n15.0M\u2299 , respectively. However, it should be noted that observations give more and more evidence that the mass function in globular/open clusters and for field stars as well is not a simple power\u2013\nlaw, but it could be rather approximated by a composite power\u2013law\n(e.g. Kroupa, Tout & Gilmore 1993, Kroupa 2002). To describe\nthe mass loss due to stellar evolution the same simplified stellar\nevolution model as adopted by CW was used. More sophisticated\nmodels of stellar and binary evolution based on fitting analytical\nformulae to the evolution tracks for stars and binaries were developed by Portegies Zwart & Verbunt (1996), Hurley, Pols & Tout\n(2000), Hurley, Tout & Pols (2003) and Belczy\u0144ski, Kalogera &\nBulik (2002). These models, among others, were used in population\nsynthesis codes (e.g. Belczy\u0144ski & Taam 2004), and simulations of\nthe evolution of real star cluster M67 (e.g. Hurley et al 2005).\nThe initial masses of stars are generated from the continuous\ndistribution given in equation (1). This ensure a natural spread in\ntheir lifetimes. To ensures that the cluster remains close to virial\nequilibrium during rapid mass loss due to stellar evolution, special\ncare is taken, that no more than 3% of the total cluster mass is lost\nduring one overall time\u2013step.\n\n2.2 Tidal Stripping\nFor tidally limited star cluster the rate of mass loss is much higher\nthan for isolated systems. This is connected with the tidal stripping\nof mass across the system boundary by the gravitational field of a\nparent galaxy. For isolated system mass loss is attributed mainly to\nrare strong interactions in the dense, inner part of the system. In the\npresent Monte Carlo code a mixed criterion is used to identify escapers: a combination of apocentre and energy\u2013based criteria (see\nPaper II). This means that no potential escapers are kept in the system. Stars regarded as escapers are instantaneously lost from the\nsystem. This is in contrast to N \u2013body simulations where stars need\ntime proportional to the dynamical time to be removed from the\nsystem. Recently, Baumgardt (2000) showed that stars with energy\ngreater than the tidal cutoff energy Et = \u2212GM/rt , in the course\nof escape, can again become bound to the system, because of distant interactions with field stars. A similar conclusion was reached\nby Fukushige & Heggie (2000), who showed that the escape time\u2013\nscale can be very long (much larger than the half\u2013mass relaxation\ntime). Additionally, during the final stages of cluster evolution or\nfor clusters with initially low central concentration, the mass loss\nacross the tidal boundary can become unstable when too many stars\nare removed from the system at the same time. To properly follow\nthese stages of evolution the time\u2013step has to be decreased to force\nsmaller mass loss.\n\n2.3 Three\u2013Body Binaries and their interactions\nIn the present Monte Carlo code (as it was described in Paper I) all\nstellar objects, including binaries, are treated as single superstars.\nThis allows to introduce into the code, in a simple and accurate\nway, processes of stochastic formation of binaries and their subsequent stochastic interactions with field stars and other binaries.\nThe procedure of binary formation in three\u2013body interactions is in\n\n3\n\ngreat detail described in Paper II. It relies on the observation that\nthe probability that the masses of the three stars involved in the\ninteraction are m1 , m2 and m3 is n1 n2 n3 /n3 (where n1 , n2 , n3\nand n are number densities of three interacting stars and the total\nnumber density, respectively) and the rate of binary formation is\nproportional to n1 n2 n3 . These considerations lead to the formula\nfor the probability of binary formation which depends only on the\nlocal total number density instead of local number densities of each\nmass involved in the interaction (see Equation 7 in Paper II). This\nprocedure substantially reduces fluctuations in the binary formation\nrate. The determination of the local number density in the Monte\nCarlo code, particularly for multi\u2013mass systems, is a very delicate\nand difficult matter (Paper I).\nThe energy generation in binary \u2013 field star interactions is\ncomputed according to the (appropriately modified for multi\u2013mass\ncase) semi\u2013empirical formula of Spitzer (Spitzer 1987). Unfortunately, for multi\u2013component systems there is no simple semi\u2013\nempirical formula which can fit all numerical data (Heggie, Hut &\nMcMillan 1996). The total probability of the interaction between\na binary of binding energy Eb consisting of mass m1 and m2 and\na field star of mass m3 was deduced from Equations (6-23), (611) and (6-12) presented in Spitzer (1987) and results of Heggie\n(1975) with an appropriately adjusted coefficient (the total probability computed is such a way gives correct value for the equal\u2013\nmass case).\n\u221a\n\u221a\n5 2\u03c0As G2 m21 m22 m123 n\nP3bf = \u221a \u221a\n\u2206t,\n(2)\n\u221a \u221a\n8 3 m12 m3 ma \u03c3Eb\nwhere m12 = m1 +m2 , m123 = m12 +m3 , ma is the mean stellar\nmass in a zone, and \u03c3 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion.\nThis procedure is, of course, oversimplified and in some situations\ncan not give correct results, for example, when a field star is very\nlight compared to the mass of the binary components.\nThe implementation of interactions between binaries in the\ncode is based on the method described by Stod\u00f3\u0142kiewicz (1986)\nand then improved in Paper II. Only strong interactions are considered, and only two types of outcomes are permitted: heavier binary\nand two single stars, or two binaries in a hyperbolic relative orbit. Stable three\u2013body configurations are not allowed. In the case\nwhen binaries are only formed in dynamical processes, and only a\nfew binaries are present, at any time, in the system, it is very difficult to use the binary density (Giersz & Spurzem 2000) to calculate\nthe probability of a binary\u2013binary interaction. Given binary can hit\nonly binaries (regarded as targets) whose actual distance from the\ncluster center lies between its pericenter and apocenter. This leads\nto the following formula for the binary\u2013binary interaction probability.\nP3b3b =\n\nw p2\n\u2206t,\n|vr | 2r 2 T\n\n(3)\n\nwhere w is the relative velocity between interacting binaries, |vr |,\nr, T and p are the radial velocity, radial position, orbital period of\na binary in the system and impact parameter (equal to 2.5 times the\nsemi\u2013major axis of the softer binary), respectively. The outcome\nof the interaction is as follows (see details in Stod\u00f3\u0142kiewicz 1986,\nPaper II and Mikkola 1983, 1984):\n\u2022 Two binaries in a hyperbolic relative orbit (12% of all interactions). Energy generation is equal to 0.4 times the binding energy\nof the softer binary.\n\u2022 One binary and two escapers (88% of all interactions). The\nsofter binary is destroyed and the harder binary increases its bind-\n\n\f4\n\nMirek Giersz\nIn order to scale the Monte Carlo time to physical units the following formula is used\n\nTable 1.

A similar procedure was introduced, with success, into the Hybrid code\n(Giersz & Spurzem 2000, 2003).\n\n3 RESULTS\nIn Paper II a survey of the evolution of N \u2013body systems influenced\nby the tidal field of a parent galaxy, by stellar evolution and by energy generation in interactions between binaries and field stars and\nbinaries themselves was discussed. Here, the first Monte Carlo simulations of million body systems are presented. The results will be\ndiscussed from the point of view of system parameters which can\nbe verified by observational data. Among others, evolution of LMF\nand GMF, anisotropy, total mass, mean mass, mass segregation and\ndensity profiles will be presented.\n\n\u0012\n\nrt\nr tM\n\n\u00131.5\n\n\u221a\n\nNT\n,\nMT ln(\u03b3NT )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere rtM is the tidal radius in Monte Carlo units, M is the total\ncluster mass and rt is the tidal radius, both are in solar mass and\npc, respectively and \u03b3 is equal to 0.11 as for single\u2013mass systems\n(Giersz & Heggie 1994). However, for multi\u2013mass systems it could\nbe much smaller (Giersz & Heggie 1996, 1997). The initial model\nis not in virial equilibrium, because of statistical noise and because\nof masses, which are assigned independently from the positions\nand velocities. Therefore, the model has to be initially rescaled to\nfulfill the virial equilibrium condition. During all the simulations\nthe virial ratio is kept within < 2% of the equilibrium value (for\nthe worst case within < 5%). Standard N \u2013body units (Heggie &\nMathieu 1986), in which the total mass M = 1, G = 1 and the initial total energy of the cluster is equal to \u22121/4, have been adopted\nfor all runs. Monte Carlo time is equal to N \u2013body time divided by\nNT /ln(\u03b3NT ). In the course of evolution, when the cluster looses\nmass, the tidal radius changes according to rt \u221d M 1/3 .\nFinally, a few words about the efficiency of the Monte Carlo\ncode presented here. The simulation of a million body systems took\nabout two/three weeks (depending on an initial model) on a Pentium 4, 2 GHz PC. This is still much faster than the biggest direct\nN \u2013body simulations performed on GRAPE\u20134 (Teraflop special\u2013\npurpose hardware). Nevertheless, the speed of the code is not high\nenough to perform large scale survey simulations in a reasonable\ntime. It is clear, that to simulate the evolution of real globular clusters with all physical processes in operation, a substantial speed\u2013up\nof the code is needed. This can be done, either by parallelizing the\ncode (in a similar way to JNR), introducing a more efficient way\nof determining the new positions of superstars, introducing superstars which contain a different number of stars, or by using a hybrid\ncode (as was done by Giersz & Spurzem 2000, 2003). However, the\nMonte Carlo code has presently a great relative advantage over the\nN \u2013body code for simulations with a large number of primordial\nbinaries. Primordial binaries substantially downgrade the performance of N \u2013body codes on supercomputers or on special\u2013purpose\nhardware. They can be introduced into the Monte Carlo code in a\nnatural way, practically without a substantial loss of performance\n(Giersz & Spurzem 2000, 2003).\n\n3.1 Initial Models\nThe initial conditions were chosen in a similar way as in the \"collaborative experiment\" (Heggie et al 1999) and Paper II. The positions and velocities of all stars were drawn from the King model\n(King 1966). All models have the same total number of stars\nNT = 1, 000, 000 and the same tidal radius rt = 33.57 pc. Masses\nof stars are drawn from the power\u2013law mass function according to\nEquation (1). The minimum mass was chosen to be 0.1M\u2299 and the\nmaximum mass 15M\u2299 . Two different values of the power\u2013law index were chosen: \u03b1 = 2.35 and 3.5. The sets of initial King models\nwere characterized by W0 = 3, 5 and 7. All models are listed in\nTable 1.\nF is the parameter (introduced by CW), which is proportional\nto the half\u2013mass relaxation time.\nF \u2261\n\nMT RG 220kms\u22121 1\n,\nM\u2299 kpc\nvg\nlnN\n\n(4)\n\nwhere RG is the distance of the globular cluster to the Galactic\nCenter, and vg is the circular speed of the cluster around the Galaxy.\n\n3.2 Global evolution.\nThe rate of cluster evolution and indirectly the strength of the tidal\nfield is described by the parameter F (Equation. 4). Generally, the\ngreater the value of F , the longer the relaxation time and the slower\nthe cluster evolution. The same relation is true also for the distance\nof a globular cluster to the Galactic Center, RG (keeping the constant total cluster mass MT and number of stars NT ). The greater\nthe F , the larger the RG . As one can see from the Table 1 distance RG is rather small This means that the galactic tidal field is\nvery strong and globular cluster evolution is very fast. These initial conditions were chosen mainly to speed up the simulations and\ndiscussed models similar to models considered by VH.\nFigure 1 presents the evolution of the total mass for all discussed models. Three phases of evolution are clearly visible. The\nfirst phase is connected with the violent mass loss due to stellar\nevolution of the most massive stars. Then, there is the long phase\nconnected with gradual mass loss due to tidal stripping.

Evolution of the total mass for models W7235, W5235, W3235\nand W335.\n\nFigure 2. Mass loss due to stellar evolution (evo) and tidal stripping (esc)\nfor models W7235, W5235, W3235 and W335\n\nnally, there is the phase connected with the tidal disruption of a\ncluster. The last phase is well visible only in model W7235, which\nevolution is followed long enough. In model W3235 on can see\na phase when the total cluster mass is nearly constant and very\nsmall (about a few thousands of the initial mass). This is an artificial effect connected with the fact that the Monte Carlo code can\nnot properly deal with systems with the total binding energy close\nto zero and consist of only a few dozen particles. It is interesting to\nnote, that the second phase (gradual tidal stripping) can be divided\ninto two subphases, clearly separated by the core collapse time.\nFor the post collapse phase the rate of mass loss is slightly steeper\nthan in the collapse phase. This can be connected with the fact that\nhard interactions, which involve binaries, start to operate introducing an additional mechanism of the mass loss (escaping stars and\nbinaries). Models with the same mass\u2013function (\u03b1 6 \u22122.35) and\nwith different W0 show very similar evolution during the phase of\ntidal stripping (except W3235). It seems that the initial mass loss\ndue to stellar evolution is not sufficiently strong to substantially\nchange the initial cluster structure. Model W3235 is not initially\nconcentrated strongly enough to survive without substantial structure changes, the violent mass loss event. Figure 1 presents qualitatively very similar features as figures shown by VH, Paper II,\nBaumgardt & Makino (2002) and Lamers et al (2005), Figure 1,\nFigures 1-3, Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.\nThe total mass loss consists of mass loss due to stellar evolution (evo) and mass loss connected with tidal stripping (esc). Results presented in Figure 2 are in a good qualitative agreement with\nthe N -body results of VH (Figure 2), taking into account that \u03b1\nadopted by VH is \u22122.5 instead \u22122.35. According to Equation 11\nof VH, the evolution of the total mass of the cluster can be fitted\nby a simple analytical expression, which consists of two terms: evo\nand esc. The amount of mass loss because of esc can be fitted (as it\nwas shown in VH) by a straight line with a coefficient \u03b2. The values of \u03b2 listed by VH are 0.828 and 0.790 for models W0 = 7, and\nW0 = 5, respectively. The equivalent values for the Monte Carlo\nmodels are 0.999 and 0.943. The bigger values of \u03b2 for the Monte\nCarlo models can be attributed mainly to the different: escape criterion, power\u2013low index of the initial mass function and slight increase of the rate of mass loss due to binary activities (see Figure 1).\nAs it was stated in Section 2.2, the escape criterion adopted in this\npaper (together with the instantaneous removal of escapers) leads to\na higher escape rate than in N \u2013body simulations. Additionally, less\n\nsteep initial mass function causes stronger mass loss due to stellar\nevolution and consequently leads to more escapers than the steeper\nmass function adopted by VH. Mass loss connected with stellar\nevolution dominates the initial phase of cluster evolution. Then the\nrate of stellar evolution substantially slows down and escape due\nto tidal stripping takes over. During this phase of evolution the rate\nof mass loss due to stellar evolution is nearly constant, and higher\nfor shallower mass functions (as expected). Energy carried away\nby stellar evolution events dominates the energy loss due to tidal\nstripping, even though the tidal mass loss is higher.\nIt is worth to note, that all models except W3235 show clear\ngravothermal oscillations in the post collapse phase. The oscillations become less and less visible when the cluster is approaching\nthe final stages of dissolution.\nGenerally, agreement throughout the evolution between the results presented here and those by AH, VH, Baumgardt & Makino\n(2002) and Lamers et al (2005) for N \u2013body models, TPZ for 2\u2013D\nFokker\u2013Planck models and by JNR and Paper II for Monte Carlo\nmodels is rather good. In all cases, the qualitative behaviour is very\nsimilar. Nevertheless, the treatment of escapers for a tidally limited system proposed by Spurzem et al (2005) can be implemented\nto properly ando more accurately follow the mass loss due to tidal\nstripping and the final stages of the cluster evolution, just before\nthe dissolution.\nAt the end of this section the evolution of the density profiles\nfor model W7235 will be discussed (see Figure 3). The very large\nnumber of particles in models allows substantial reduction in statistical fluctuations and computation (with high precision) of the\ndensity profiles in the course of cluster evolution. From the theoretical considerations it follows that, during the collapse phase the\nnearly isothermal core is building up. At the time of core bounce\n(about 3.5 Gyr) the density profile reaches the theoretically predicted power\u2013low index equal to \u22122.2. Then this index is preserved\nduring the further post\u2013collapse evolution. For models W7235,\nW5235 and W335 the evolution of density profiles is practically\nthe same. Only for model W3235, which undergoes strong mass\nloss due to stellar evolution and tidal stripping the density profiles\ndo not show any signs of power\u2013low core development. The initial\nshape of the profile is practically preserved (taking into account the\nreduction of central density and tidal radius).\n\n\f6\n\nMirek Giersz\n10000\n\n1000\n\n-2.2\n\n5\n100\n\n0.2\n\nM = 319,305 Mo\nN = 1,000,000\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 15.0 Mo\nalpha = -2.35\nRtid = 33.57 pc\nWo = 7\n\n6\n\n7\n4\n\n0.1\n40%\n\n3\n\n10\n\nAnisotropy\n\n2\n1\n\nlog(\u03c1)\n\n10%\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n0.1\n\n1 - 0 Gyr\n2 - 2 Gyr\n3 - 3 Gyr\n4 - 3.5 Gyr\n5 - 4.0 Gyr\n6 - 5.0 Gyr\n7 - 10.0 Gyr\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nM = 319,305 Mo\nN = 1,000,000\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 15.0 Mo\nalpha = -2.35\nRtid = 33.57 pc\nWo = 3\n\n-0.2\n\n99%\n\n-0.3\n0.0001\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\nlog(r)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nFigure 4.

For isotropic systems A is equal to\nzero. Systems preferentially populated by radial orbits have A positive and systems preferentially populated by tangential orbits have\nA negative. The evolution of anisotropy is presented in Figures 4 to\n6 for models W3235, W5235 and W7235, respectively. As can be\nseen in Figure 4, for systems which can not survive the violent initial mass loss without strong structural changes (see discussion in\nthe previous section), anisotropy stays close to zero with very large\nfluctuations. The system does not live long enough and the tidal\nstripping is strong enough to prevent the developing of substantial\npositive or negative anisotropy. For model W5235 the cluster is not\ninitially very strongly concentrated, so the mass loss due to stellar\nevolution and consequently by tidal stripping prevents the development of positive anisotropy in the outer and middle parts of the\nsystem (see Figure 5). From the very beginning anisotropy for these\nregions becomes negative. Stars, which are preferentially on radial\norbits, escape leaving mainly stars on tangential orbits. Finally, just\nbefore cluster disruption, the anisotropy in the whole system becomes slightly positive. At that time of cluster evolution most stars\nhave radial orbits. Clusters concentrated stronger (W7235), develop\nfrom the very beginning a small positive anisotropy in the outer and\nmiddle parts of the system (see Figure 6). In the course of evolution\nthe amount of anisotropy in the outer parts of the system is reduced\nsubstantially by tidal stripping, as stars on radial orbits escape preferentially. As tidal stripping exposes deeper and deeper parts of\nthe system, the anisotropy (for large Lagrangian radii) gradually\ndecreases and eventually becomes negative. At the same time the\nanisotropy in the middle and inner parts of the system stays close\nto zero.\nIt is interesting to note that for clusters which undergo core\ncollapse (W5235 and W7235) the anisotropy in the inner parts of\nthe system becomes slightly positive just around the collapse time.\nThis behaviour can be attributed to the binary activities, which are\n\nAnisotropy\n\nA\u22612\u2212\n\n4000\nTime (Myr)\n\nFigure 3.

Interactions between binaries and field stars (relaxation and energy generation) put stars on\nmore radial orbits.\nThe anisotropy of main\u2013sequence stars shows very similar\nbehaviour to that discussed above. Mass segregation forces white\ndwarfs and neutron stars (most massive stars) to preferentially occupy the inner parts of the system. Therefore the anisotropy for\nthem is much more modest than for the main\u2013sequence stars, and\nstays close to zero. Anisotropy evolution agrees very well with the\nresults of Paper II and qualitatively with the results obtained by\nTakahashi (1997) and Takahashi & Lee (2000).\n\n3.4 Mass segregation.\nThree main effects may be expected to govern the evolution of the\nmass function in models studied in this paper. First, there is a period of violent mass loss due to sellar evolution of the most massive stars.

Evolution of the anisotropy for 10%, 40% and 99% Lagrangian\nradii for model W7235.\n\nmainly during core collapse and is relatively unaffected by the presence of a tidal field. Thirdly, there is the effect of the tidal field\nitself, which becomes more important after core collapse or even\nearlier (for models with a shallow mass function and with low concentration). Because the tides preferentially remove stars from the\nouter parts of the system, which are mainly populated by low\u2013mass\nstars (mass segregation), one can expect that the mean mass should\nincrease as evolution proceeds, making allowance for stellar evolution.\nThe basic results are illustrated in Figure 7 for the total mean\nmass inside the 10% and 50% Lagrangian radii and the tidal radius, and in Figure 8 for the mean mass of main\u2013sequence stars\nand white dwarfs inside 10% Lagrangian radius for model W5235.\nThe violent and strong mass loss due to stellar evolution is characterized by an initial decrease of the mean mass. The evolution of the\nmost massive stars will remove a substantial amount of mass from\nthe system and, consequently, greatly lower the mean mass in the\nwhole system. This behaviour is visible also in the other models,\nbut with one exception. The mean mass inside the 10% Lagrangian\nradius for model W7235 is increasing instead of decreasing. For\nthis model, the initial concentration is high enough to force very\nquick mass segregation in the central part of the system. The most\nmassive main sequence stars (not evolved yet): white dwarfs and\nneutron stars, sink into the center. For model W3235 for most of\nthe time the mean mass stays nearly constant for the whole system. Just before the cluster dissolution it substantially increases.\nFor all models tidal stripping connected mainly with removal of\nless massive stars forces the mean mass in the middle and outer\nparts of the system to steadily increase. The much faster increase\nof the mean mass inside the 10% Lagrangian radius (mass segregation) than in the outer Lagrangian radii (50% and 99%) during\nthe collapse phase nearly stops at the core bounce time. The subsequent evolution is characterized by the slower rate of increase of\nthe mean mass (close to the time of the core bounce the mean mass\nis practically constant). This is in good agreement with results obtained by Giersz & Heggie (1997) for small N \u2013body simulations\nand for Monte Carlo simulations presented in Paper II. The reason\nfor the nearly constant mean mass is unclear. The slow increase of\nthe mean mass can be attributed to the binary activity, which leads\nto removal of some low mass stars from the core. For all models\nthe effect of tides manifests itself by a gradual increase of the mean\nmass in the halo.\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\nTime (Myr)\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\nFigure 7.

Evolution of the mean mass for 10% Lagrangian radius for model\nW5235; ms and wd means mean\u2013sequence stars and white dwarfs, respectively.\n\nThe evolution of the mean mass for main\u2013sequence stars and\nwhite dwarfs for the inner 10% Lagrangian radii is shown on Figure 8. When less and less massive main\u2013sequence stars finish their\nevolution as less and less massive white dwarfs, the mean mass of\nwhite dwarfs decreases with time. The newly created less massive\nwhite dwarfs affect the mean mass of white dwarfs more strongly\nfor the steeper mass function than for the shallower one. For the\nsteeper mass function a smaller number of massive white dwarfs\nis created comparable to the shallower mass function. At the time\naround the core bounce the average mass of white dwarfs increases.\nThis is connected with the decreasing core size and continuing\nmass segregation. Deeper in the cluster center a higher fraction\nof massive white dwarfs is present. In the post collapse phase the\nwhite dwarfs average mass is decreasing. Binaries start to be created mainly from the most massive stars (neutron stars and white\ndwarfs) deep in the core. They dynamically interact with other stars\nand in the course of evolution are removed from the system together\nwith some massive white dwarfs. This leads to the decrease of the\nmean mass of white dwarfs.\nThe mean mass of main\u2013sequence stars initially slightly de-\n\n\f8\n\nMirek Giersz\n3\n1\n2.5\nR(60-tide)\n0.8\n\nglobal\n\n2\nms/total\nM = 319,305 Mo\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 15.0 Mo\n\nN = 1,000,000\n\nalpha = -2.35\n\n\u03b1\n\nMass Ratio\n\nM = 319,305 Mo\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 15.0 Mo\n\n1\n\nR(0-30)\n\nRtid = 33.57 pc\n\nalpha = -2.35\n\n0.4\n\nR(30-60)\n\nN = 1,000,000\n\n1.5\n0.6\n\nWo = 5\n\nRtid = 33.57 pc\n\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 0.5 Mo for \u03b1\n\n0.5\n\nWo = 5\nMmin = 0.1 Mo Mmax = 0.5 Mo for \u03b1\n\nwd/total\n\n0.2\n\n(ms+wd+ns)/total\n\n0\n\n-0.5\nns/total\n\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\nTime (Myr)\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\nFigure 9.

Then, there is a period of the gradual increase of the\nmean mass due to mass segregation. At late phases of cluster evolution the rate of increase of the mean mass speeds up. Around the\ncore bounce time one can observe the break of the rate of increase\nof the main\u2013sequence average mass. This can be again attributed to\nbinary activities.\nThe evolution of the total mean stellar mass in the different\nplaces of the system (Figure 7) and the evolution of the average\nmass inside 10% Lagrangian radius for main\u2013sequence stars and\nwhite dwarfs (Figure 8) agree very well with the results obtained in\nPaper II.\nStellar evolution will change a stellar content of the cluster.\nIn the course of time main\u2013sequence stars will evolve creating first\nblack holes, neutron stars and then white dwarfs with decreasing\nmasses.

The fraction of evolved stars present\nin the system at any time results from two processes which act in\nopposite directions: stellar evolution (formation) and evaporation\nacross the tidal boundary (loss). At the beginning of cluster evolution the sharp increase of the mass ratio of evolved stars and decrease of the mass ratio of main\u2013sequence stars and the total mass\nratio are connected with the stellar evolution of the most massive\nstars in the system. Then, the steady increase of the mass ratio for\nwd and ns is observed. After the time of core bounce the ratio\nfor ns is slowly decreasing because of binary activities (the most\nmassive stars (neutron stars) are with the highest probability involved in binary formation and finally removed from the system by\ninteractions with the field stars and other binaries). The ratios for\nms + wd + ns and ms are decreasing, as expected. At the time\nclose to the dissolution time evolved stars consists of up to 75%\nof the mass of the all stars and up to 63% of the number of all\nstars. The fraction of mass/number of wd is larger for systems with\nshorter relaxation time and with stronger influence of the tidal field\nof a parent galaxy. This is in a very good agreement with the results\nobtained by VH.\nFigure 10 shows the evolution of the mass ratio of evolved\nstars to the actual total mass for different zones in the system (see\ndescription of Figure 10). As expected, the mass segregation process and removal of less massive stars due to the evaporation process across the tidal boundary cause steady increase of the mass ratios. For the inner part of the system (up to about 5% Lagrangian radius), during the core collapse time the rate of increase of the mass\nratio is the fastest in the system. However, after the core bounce\nthe rate becomes slowest The mass ratio is nearly constant. This is\nconnected with the fact that the mass segregation process is nearly\ncompleted at the time of core bounce (see Figure 7 and its discussion). Further increase of the mass ratio can be mainly attributed to\nbinary activities. For parts of the system outside 10% Lagrangian\nradius the behaviour of the mass ratio is opposite to that discussed\nearlier. During the collapse phase the rate of mass ratio increase is\nslower than in the post collapse phase. The further out 10% Lagrangian radius the ratios are smaller and faster, respectively. This\nbehaviour can be attributed to the properties of the stripping process, which is more and more effective when deeper and deeper\nparts of the system are exposed. In between these two zones (La-\n\n\fMONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF STAR CLUSTERS III\ngrangian radius between 5% and 10%) the rate of increase of mass\nratio is nearly constant during the whole evolution. The amount of\nmass in evolved stars in the core can be as high as 97% and in the\nouter parts of the system up to 55%, at the time close to the dissolution time. The same qualitative behaviour is observed for other\nmodels. However, for models with steeper initial mass function and\nfor more concentrated ones the mass ratios are smaller. For initially\nmore concentrated models the time of core bounce is much shorter\nthan for the less concentrated models. So, the process of mass segregation is less advanced and therefore the mass ratios are smaller.\nAlso, for more concentrated cluster the evaporation process is less\neffective. The ratios are about 10% smaller than for W5325 model.\nFor the model W3235, which does not enter the post\u2013collapse evolution before the cluster dissolution the mass ratios behave like for\nother models in the collapse phase, but the spread between ratios\nin different zones is much smaller. It is worth to note that cluster\nat the time 15 Gyr can consist of up to 90% of evolved stars in\nthe core and up to 10% of evolved stars in the outer parts of the\nsystem. This conclusion has very important observational consequences. The presence of a substantial number of practically invisible stars has to be taken into account when the global globular\ncluster parameters are drown from the observations.\nNow lets discuss the evolution of the local (LMF) and global\n(GMF) mass functions in comparison to the initial mass function\n(IMF). According to VH the mass slope of a mass function can be\nobtained from the numerical data in the following way:\n\u03b1=\n\nln(dN/dm1 )1 \u2212 ln(dN/dm2 )2\nln(m1 ) \u2212 ln(m2 )\n\n(7)\n\n(dN/dm)1,2 is estimated by N1,2 (t)/\u2206m1,2 , where N1,2 (t) is the\ntotal number of stars between m1,2 and m1,2 + \u2206m1,2 . According\nto VH m1 and m2 were chosen to 0.1M\u2299 and 0.5M\u2299 , respectively. The LMF were calculated for three zones (VH): up to 30%\nLagrangian radius, between 30% and 60% Lagrangian radii and\nfrom 60% Lagrangian radius up to tidal radius. In the case when\nonly mass segregation is taken into account, the LMF in the inner\nparts of the system becomes flatter and in the outer parts becomes\nsteeper. The evaporation process acts in the opposite direction. It\ntends to flatten the mass function because of the preferential removal from the system (particularly from the outer parts) of low\nmass stars. As it can be seen in Figure 11 the theoretically predicted\nbehaviour of LMF is qualitatively represented by the numerical results. For all the discussed models the LMF for the outermost parts\nof the system initially increases. The increase is slightly higher for\nmore concentrated systems with the same IMF (this is consistent\nwith the picture of mass segregation), and even more pronounced\nfor the system with the same concentration but with stepper mass\nfunction. For all models the GMF closely resembles the LMF in\nthe middle parts of the system. The IMF during dynamical cluster evolution is very quickly forgotten and practically impossible to\nrecover from the observational data. The actual GMF of globular\nclusters can be recovered from observational data for middle parts\nof the system (close to the half\u2013mass radius). The results discussed\nabove are in a very good agreement with the results obtained by\nVH for N \u2013body runs.\n\n4 CONCLUSIONS.\nThis paper is a continuation of Paper I and II, in which it was\nshown that the Monte Carlo method is a robust scheme to study,\nin an effective way, the evolution of very large N \u2013body systems.\n\n9\n\nThe Monte Carlo method describes in a proper way the graininess\nof the gravitational field and the stochasticity of real N \u2013body systems. It provides, in almost as much detail as N \u2013body simulations,\ninformation about the movement of any object in the system. In\nthat respect the Monte Carlo scheme can be regarded as a method\nwhich lies between direct N \u2013body and Fokker\u2013Planck models and\ncombines most advantages of both these methods. This is the first\nimportant step in the direction of simulating the evolution of a real\nglobular cluster.\nIt was shown that the results obtained in this paper are in qualitative agreement with these presented by CW, VH, AH, TPZ, JNR,\nPaper II, Baumgardt & Makino (2002) and Lamers et al 2005.\nParticularly good agreement is obtained with VH's N \u2013body simulations and what is not surprising, with results of Monte Carlo\nsimulations presented in Paper II. All models survive the phase of\nrapid mass loss and then undergo core collapse and then subsequent post\u2013collapse expansion (except model W3235) in a manner similar to isolated models. The expansion phase is eventually\nreversed when tidal limitation becomes important. As in isolated\nmodels, mass segregation substantially slows down by the end of\ncore collapse. Mass loss connected with stellar evolution dominates\nthe initial phase of cluster evolution. Then the rate of stellar evolution substantially slows down and escape due to tidal stripping\ntakes over. During this phase of evolution the rate of mass loss is\nnearly constant, and higher for shallower mass functions. Energy\ncarried away by stellar evolution events dominates the energy loss\ndue to tidal stripping, even though the tidal mass loss is higher. For\nthe first time, because of the large number of particles in simulations (1, 000, 000) which results in substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations, it was possible to compute in an accurate way the\nevolution of density profiles. The development of power\u2013low density profile is clearly visible and agrees very well with theoretical\npredictions. The observed power\u2013low index is equal to about \u22122.2.\nThe strongly concentrated model (W7235), shows a modest initial\nbuild up of anisotropy in the outer parts of the system. As tidal stripping exposes the inner parts of the system, the anisotropy gradually\ndecreases and eventually becomes slightly negative. Model W5235\nfrom the very beginning develops in the outer parts of the system\nnegative anisotropy. The cluster is not concentrated enough to prevent removal of stars which are preferentially on radial orbits. The\nnegative anisotropy stays negative until the time of cluster disruption, when it becomes slightly positive (during cluster disruption\nmost stars are on radial orbits). Because of mass segregation, and\ndue to evaporation across the tidal boundary, which preferentially\nremoves low mass stars, the mean mass in the cluster increases with\ntime. During the core collapse the rate of increase of the mean mass\nis highest in the central parts of the system (mass segregation). After the core bounce there is a substantial increase in the mean mass\nin the middle and outer parts of the system (tidal stripping), and\nmore modest increase in the inner parts of the system, which is\nmainly connected with binary activity. The fraction of evolved stars\nis increasing during the cluster evolution. This fraction is larger for\nsystems with shorter relaxation time and stronger influence of the\ntidal field of a parent galaxy. The mass ratio of evolved stars can be\nas high as nearly 65% at the outer parts of the system up to nearly\n98% in the core. At the time of 15 Gyr these ratios are 90% and\n10%, respectively. The presence of a substantial number of practically invisible stars has very important consequences for the interpretation of observational data and it has to be taken into account\nwhen the global globular cluster parameters are drown from the\nobservations. Because of stellar evolution, mass segregation and\nevaporation of stars the IMF is quickly forgotten and impossible\n\n\f10\n\nMirek Giersz\n\nto recover from the observational data. The actual GMF closely\nresembles the LMF for the middle parts of the system (close to\nhalf\u2013mass radius). These results are in an excellent agreement with\nN \u2013body simulations presented by VH.\nIn order to perform simulations of real globular clusters the\ndescription of some processes, already included in the code has\nto be improved, and several additional physical processes have to\nbe added to the code. Stellar and binary evolution, more accurate\ntreatment for energy generation by binaries, particularly in binary\u2013\nbinary interaction, and proper treatment of the escape process in\nthe presence of a tidal field are still waiting for improvement. One\nof the population synthesis codes developed by Hurley (Hurley et\nal 2000, 2002), Portegies Zwart (Portegies Zwart & Verbunt 1966)\nand Belczy\u0144ski (Belczy\u0144ski, Kalogera & Bulik 2002) can be used\nto follow more accurately single star and binary evolution. The implementation of techniques used in Aarseth's N BODY codes for\ndirect integrations of a few body subsystems can cure the problem\nof energy generation in 3\u2013body and 4\u2013body interactions (Giersz &\nSpurzem 2003). The treatment of escapers proposed by Spurzem et\nal (2005) can be implemented to solve the problem of escapers in\nthe tidal field (problem which is inherently connected with gaseous,\nFokker\u2013Planck and Monte Carlo codes). The tidal shock heating\nof the cluster due to passages through the Galactic disk, interaction with the bulge, shock\u2013induced relaxation, primordial binaries,\nphysical collisions between single stars and binaries are some of\nthe processes, which are waiting for implementation into the code.\nThe inclusion of all these processes does not pose a fundamental\ntheoretical challenge, but is rather complicated from the technical\npoint of view. The international collaboration called MODEST was\nsetup a few years ago to solve problems with merging all available\ncodes (hydrodynamical, stelar evolution and dynamical) into a code\nwhich can deal in detail with the evolution of real globular clusters (see http://www.manybody.org/modest). Inclusion into the\nMonte Carlo code of as much as possible physical processes will\nallow to perform detailed comparison between simulations and observed properties of globular clusters, and will also help to understand the conditions of globular cluster formation and explain how\npeculiar objects observed in clusters can be formed. These types\nof simulations will also help us to introduce, in a proper way, into\nfuture N \u2013body simulations all the necessary processes required to\nsimulate the evolution of real globular clusters on a star\u2013by\u2013star\nbasis from their birth to their death.\n\nAcknowledgments I would like to thank Douglas C.
