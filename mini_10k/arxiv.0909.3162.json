In [15], C.\nMenini and A. Orsatti asked under which conditions on P , the functors P \u2297S \u2212\nand HomR (P, \u2212) induce an equivalence between certain subcategories of R M closed\nunder factor modules (i.e. Gen(P )) and subcategories of S M closed under submodules (i.e. Cogen(Hom(P, Q)) for some cogenerator Q in R M). Such modules P are\ncalled \u22c6-modules and it is well-known that they are closely related to tilting modules\n(e.g., [7], [16]).\nBecause of the effectiveness of these notions in representation theory of finite\ndimensional algebras (see Assem [1]), various attempts have been made to extend\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. CLARK AND R. WISBAUER\n\nthem to more general situations. This was done mostly in categories which do permit\nsome technical tools needed (e.g. additivity, tensor product).\nThe purpose of this article is to filter out the categorical essence of the theory\nand to formulate the interesting parts for arbitrary categories. For this we consider\na pair (F, G) of adjoint functors between categories A and B. The crucial step is the\nobservation that these induce functors between the category BF G of comodules for\nthe comonad F G on B and the category AGF of modules for the monad GF on A\n(see 3.1). When the comonad F G (equivalently the monad GF ) is idempotent, AF G\nmay be considered as a coreflective subcategory of A and BGF becomes a reflective\nsubcategory of B and these categories are equivalent. To improve the setting one\nmay additionally require BF G to be closed under factor objects and AGF to be closed\nunder subobjects. This is achieved by stipulating that the unit of the adjunction is\nan extremal epimorphism in A and its counit is an extremal monomorphism in B.\nIn this case we say that G is a \u22c6-functor or that (F, G) is a pair of \u22c6-functors. Note\nthat no additional structural conditions on the categories are employed.\nBy definition, an (R, S)-bimodule P is a \u22c6-module provided the functor HomR (P, \u2212) :\nM\n\u2192 S M is a \u22c6-functor and our results apply immediately to this situation.\nR\nA \u22c6-module P is a tilting module if (and only if) P is a subgenerator in R M. To\ntransfer this property to a \u22c6-functor G, one has to require that every object A in\nA permits a monomorphism A \u2192 G(B) for some B \u2208 B. We will not go into this\nquestion here.\nCentral to our investigation are the idempotent monads (comonads) which have\nappeared in various places in the literature, e.g., Maranda [14], Isbell [10], Lambek\nand Rattray [12, 13], and Deleanu, Frei and Hilton [9].\n\n2. Preliminaries\nFor convenience we recall the basic structures from category theory which will be\nneeded in the sequel.\n2.1. Monads. A monad on a category A is a triple T = (T, \u03bc, \u03b7) where T : A \u2192 A is\nan endofunctor and \u03bc : T T \u2192 T , \u03b7 : IdA \u2192 T are natural transformations inducing\ncommutative diagrams\nTTT\n\nT\u03bc\n\n/ TT\n\nT B\nB\n\n\u000f\n\nTT\n\n\u03bc\n\n/ TT o\n\n\u03b7T\n\nBB\n||\nB\n\u03bc |||\n= BBB\n=\n|\n! \u000f }||\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bcT\n\nT\u03b7\n\n\u000f\n\n/ T,\n\nT\n\nT\n.\n\n2.2.

Given a monad T = (T, \u03bc, \u03b7) on the category A, an\nobject A \u2208 A with a morphism \u03c1A : T (A) \u2192 A is called a T-module (or T-algebra)\nif \u03c1A \u25e6 \u03b7A = IdA and \u03c1A induces commutativity of the diagram\nT T (A)\n\nT (\u03c1A )\n\n\u03bcA\n\n/ T (A)\n\u03c1A\n\n\u000f\n\nT (A)\n\n\u03c1A\n\n\u000f\n/ A.\n\n\fIDEMPOTENT MONADS AND\n\n\u22c6-FUNCTORS\n\n3\n\nA morphism between T-modules (A, \u03c1A ) and (A\u2032 , \u03c1A\u2032 ) is an f : A \u2192 A\u2032 in A satisfying f \u25e6 \u03c1A = \u03c1A\u2032 \u25e6 T (f ). We denote the set of these morphisms by MorT (A, A\u2032 )\nand the category of T-modules by AT .\n2.3. Comonads. A comonad on a category A is a triple S = (S, \u03b4, \u03b5) where S :\nA \u2192 A is an endofunctor and \u03b4 : S \u2192 SS, \u03b5 : S \u2192 IdA are natural transformations\ninducing commutative diagrams\nS\n\n\u03b4\n\n/ SS\n\n\u03b4\n\nS\n| CCC\nCC=\n||\n|\nCC\n\u03b4\n|\n|\nC!\n\u000f\n|~ |\no\n/ S.\nS\nSS\n=\n\nS\u03b4\n\n\u000f\n\nSS\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03b4S\n\n/ SSS,\n\nS\u03b5\n\n\u03b5S\n\n2.4.

We denote the set of these morphisms by MorS (A, A\u2032 )\nand the category of S-comodules by AS .\n2.5. Adjoint functors. Let F : A \u2192 B and G : B \u2192 A be (covariant) functors\nbetween any categories A, B. The pair (F, G) is called adjoint (or an adjunction)\nand F (resply.

(1.i), (2.i) are well-known properties of adjoint functors.\n(1.ii) describes the comparison functor. To show its properties recall that naturality of \u03b5 yields the commutative diagram (e.g. [2, Section 3])\nF GF G\n\n\u03b5F G /\n\nFG\n\u03b5\n\nF G\u03b5\n\n\u000f\n\nFG\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u000f\n\n/ Id.\n\nAction of G from the left and application to B yields the commutative diagram\nGF GF G(B)\n\nG\u03b5F GB\n\n/ GF G(B)\n\nGF G\u03b5B\n\nG\u03b5B\n\n\u000f\n\nGF G(B)\n\nG\u03b5B\n\n\u000f\n\n/ G(B).\n\nThis proves the associativity condition for the GF -module G(B). Unitality follows\nfrom the triangular identities (2.5). Again by naturality of \u03b5, for any f \u2208 B, G(f ) is\na GF -module morphism.\nThe proof of (2.ii) is dual to that of (1.ii).\n\u2293\n\u2294\n2.8. Free functor for a monad.

(a)\u21d2(b) \u03b7A is the image of Id : Fe(A) \u2192 Fe(A) under \u03c6\u0303 and hence a GF module morphism. By 3.2, this implies that \u03b7A is an isomorphism for all GF -modules\nA. Since G(B) is a GF -module for any B \u2208 B, we have \u03b7G(B) : G(B) \u2192 GF G(B)\nan isomorphism, that is, \u03b7G : G \u2192 GF G is an isomorphism.\n(b)\u21d2(c) By the triangular identities, (b) implies that G\u03b5 and G\u03b5F are also isomorphisms.\n(c)\u21d2(a) Unitality and the triangular identities yield the equalities\nGF (\u03c1A ) \u25e6 GF \u03b7A = G\u03b5FA \u25e6 GF \u03b7A = G\u03b5FA \u25e6 \u03b7GFA = IdGFA .\nGiven (c), we conclude from these that GF \u03b7A = \u03b7GFA is an isomorphism and thus\nGF (\u03c1A ) = G\u03b5FA .

Remarks. Most of these properties have been considered somewhere in the\nliterature. Perhaps the first hint of idempotent pairs is given in Maranda [14, Proposition] under the name idempotent constructions (1966). Isbell discussed their role\nin [10] calling them Galois connections (1971). In Lambek and Rattray [12] they\nare investigated in the context of localisation and duality (1975). In the same year\nthey were studied in Deleanu, Frei and Hilton [9, Section 2] where it is shown that\ntheir Kleisli categories are isomorphic to the category of fractions (of invertible morphisms). Extending these ideas, idempotent approximations to any monad are the\ntopic of Casacuberta and Frei [4].\nFor the adjoint functor pair (F, G) we use the notation (e.g. [12])\nFix(GF, \u03b7) = {A \u2208 A | \u03b7A : A \u2192 GF (A) is an isomorphism},\nFix(F G, \u03b5) = {B \u2208 B | \u03b5B : F G(B) \u2192 B is an isomorphism}.\nWe denote the (isomorphic) closure of the image of GF in A and F G in B by GF (A)\nand F G(B), respectively.\n3.6.

WISBAUER\n\nNote that the corresponding situation in complete and cocomplete abelian categories is described in [5, Theorem 1.6].\nRecall that the module P is self-small if, for any set \u039b, the canonical map\nHomR (P, P )(\u039b) \u2192 HomR (P, P (\u039b) )\nis an isomorphism, and P is called w-\u03a3-quasiprojective if HomR (P, \u2212) respects exactness of sequences\n0 \u2192 K \u2192 P (\u039b) \u2192 N \u2192 0,\nwhere K \u2208 Gen(P ), \u039b any set.\nThe following observations are essentially known from module theory.\n4.3. Proposition. For an R-module P with S = EndS (P ), the following are equivalent:\n(a) \u03b7X : X \u2192 HP TP (X) is surjective for all X \u2208 S M;\n(b) P is self-small and w-\u03a3-quasiprojective;\n(c) (TP , HP ) is an idempotent functor pair and S MHP TP is closed under submodules in S M..\nFor the proof we refer to [16], [6]. The assertions where shown by Lambek and\nRattray for a self-small object in a cocomplete additive category (see [13, Theorem\n4], [11, Proposition 1]).\nThe following corresponds to [17, 4.4].\n4.4. Proposition. For an R-module P with S = EndS (P ) the following are equivalent:\n(a) \u03b5N : TP HP (N ) \u2192 N is monomorph (injective) for all N \u2208 R M;\n(b) (TP , HP ) is idempotent and R MTP HP is closed under factor modules in R M.\nAs suggested in 3.9, we call HP a \u22c6-functor provided the unit \u03b7S M : Id \u2192 HP TP\nis an epimorphism and the counit \u03b5 : TP HP \u2192 IdR M is a monomorphism. In this\ncase, the module P is called a \u22c6-module ([15], [7]) and we obtain:\n4.5. Theorem. For an R-module P with S = EndR (P ), the following are equivalent:\n(a) P is a \u22c6-module;\n(b) HP is a \u22c6-functor;\n(c) (TP , HP ) induces an equivalence\nTP : S MHP TP \u2192 R MTP HP ,\n\nHP : R MTP HP \u2192 S MHP TP ,\n\nwhere R MTP HP is closed under factor modules in\nunder submodules in S M.\n\nRM\n\nand S MHP TP is closed\n\nThe equivalence of (a) and (b) is shown in [6, Theorem 4.1] (see also [15], [7], [1],\n[16]). For objects in any Grothendieck category they are shown in Colpi [8, Theorem\n3.2].\nAcknowledgements.
