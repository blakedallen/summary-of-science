There are emissions from human metabolism; those are moisture,\ncarbon dioxide, and bio-effluents. Other emissions are due to our well-being, high living standard\nand habits. These pollutants are humidity from cooking, body and clothes washing, and cleaning\nthe dwelling and also combustion products like the oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen.\nMany of the materials used in buildings, either as structural materials or as furnishings,\nhousehold chemical products, and some electric devices are sources of pollution. They release\nvolatile organic compounds (VOC) and ozone; over two hundred VOCs have been identified in\nthe indoor environment [1].\n\n\fIndoor pollutants of interest also include airborne particles and reactive gases from traffic and\nindustrial facilities. These may be diesel soot or the constituents of photochemical smog. The\nsources can also be radon which is a radioactive gas from the ground, and carbon monoxide from\na garage having direct access to the dwelling.\nA significant number of these pollutants, such as radon, formaldehydes, VOCs, humidity,\nairborne pollen and particles, can be hazardous for the occupants at high concentration level. To\nensure a satisfactory indoor air quality, the concentration of indoor pollutants must be kept to\nsafe, low risk levels. Ventilation provides one means for achieving this.\nFrench ventilation principle\nThree main ventilation systems can be used for this purpose:\n-\n\nmechanical ventilation with local or centralised fans for exhaust, supply or balancedventilation with/without heat recovery;\nnatural ventilation which can be performed by thermal buoyancy, or window opening;\nhybrid ventilation, a combination of both natural and mechanical ventilation.\n\nVarious strategies and principles are run to perform these systems in order to achieve good\nindoor air quality, energy efficiency, and comfort.\nSince 1969, the French regulation on residential buildings ventilation is based on general and\ncontinuous air renewal [2,3]. The outside air enters the habitable rooms, that is the living room\nand bedrooms, via natural air inlets. Polluted air leaves the dwelling in service rooms which are\nkitchen, bathroom, shower and toilets, by mechanical exhaust vents (see figure 2). In this way, air\nis transferred from the higher air quality rooms to those with a lower one; the energy loss due to\nventilation is thus reduced because heated air coming from the habitable rooms is used for\nventilating the service rooms. An other advantage of such a regulation is that, whatever the\nweather may be, the flow of ventilation remains constant and known in each service room [3].\nThis ventilation principle is so-called here CVC principle as \"Central Ventilation by air\nCirculation through the dwelling\" or central exhaust mechanical ventilation. It is allowed in all\nthe residences, single and multi-family houses, by the French ventilation regulation [2,5,6].\nInternal air movements are governed by two main factors [7]:\n-\n\nnatural driven forces: wind, stack effects due to air density difference between rooms;\nand mechanical forces driven by operating fans.\n\nIn some cases, at high concentration difference of humidity or gaseous pollutants, the flow can be\nalso governed by the concentration gradient. In mechanical systems, they result from both natural\nand mechanical effects. However, the latter should be prevalent on stack effect and infiltrations\nin order to impose internal flows direction, and then achieve mechanical ventilation purposes [7].\nThe objective of the current study is to test out, by experimental means, the CVC ventilation\nprinciple in order to check which of the above parameters are influential on the internal air flows,\nso on pollutant transport, and how they can effectively affect its operation. The lifted question is\ntherefore to known whether a pollutant coming from the living room can reach a bedroom on the\nfirst floor according to a number of conditions.\n\n\fMETHODS\nThe experimental house\nExperiments on CVC mechanical ventilation principle had been carried out in the CSTB\nexperimental house MARIA (Mechanized house for Advanced Research on Indoor Air) [9], for\nvarious conditions with regard to windows and internal doors. MARIA is a three-level house is\nlocated at the CSTB research centre in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, near Paris. It has four bedrooms, a\nshower, and a bathroom on the first floor. The living, the kitchen, and the toilets are situated on\nthe ground floor. There is a garage on the underground floor.\nPurpose-built orifices are located in the facades in order to simulate different levels of envelope\nair leakage in the house. Experimental evaluation performed gave a residual air leakage value of\n1.2 m3/h/m2, and when 30 apertures were open, air leakage was 2.2 m3/h/m2. Further information\nabout these results is available in [10].\nExperiments\nTracer gas constant injection method was used to simulate a pollutant emission in the living\nroom. Sulphur hexafluoride, SF6, was so continuously released during 3 hours at 1.5 ml/s flow\nrate to represent occupant presence or activity. Concentrations were continuously measured at six\ndifferent points within the dwelling (figure 2): measurement sensors were placed in the living,\nthe kitchen, the bathroom, the shower, the hall, and in bedroom 3. The tracer gas was considered\nabsent outside. Pollutant concentration in the bedroom aimed to show if internal flows followed\nthe theory of the CVC principle. After the injection, decay method was used to evaluate air\nchange rate.\nThese measurements were done with a six-point sampler for pumping air from measurement\npoints, and a multi-gas monitor that calculated pollutant concentrations. All devices were placed\nat the underground floor, and the analysed air from the monitor was rejected outside and far from\nthe building to avoid additional source.\n\na)\nb)\nFigure 1: The CSTB experimental house MARIA.\na) Outside view, b) Pollutant injection and measurement in the living room.\n\n\fCases studied\nDuring the experiments, all external doors, internal doors of service rooms and windows were\nkept closed. We then studied many situations with regard to internal doors of living and\nbedrooms, air leakage openings, and windows:\n-\n\nCase 1: internal doors and air leakage orifices were closed;\nCase 2: internal doors were closed and 30 orifices were open;\nCase 3: internal doors were open and orifices were closed;\nCase 4: internal doors and 30 orifices were open;\nCase 5: internal doors and 30 orifices were open, and exceptionally the window of\nbedroom 3 was open too.\n\nTo run the CVC principle in MARIA, the house was equipped with mechanical exhaust\nventilation and natural air inlets in the habitable rooms. The configuration was as follows (fig. 2):\n-\n\ncontinuous extraction in the kitchen at about 60 m3/h flowrate;\ncontinuous extraction in both shower and bathroom at a mean of 33 m3/h flowrate per\nroom;\nmechanical extraction was stopped in the toilets (in order to make some equilibrate flows\nbetween the two levels of the building).\n\nIn each case, outdoor and rooms temperatures, and wind speed were measured by the mean of the\nCSTB meteorological station. Numbers of tests have been carried out in order to check out the\nrepetitiveness of the results. The following part deals with the obtained results and their analysis.\n\n4\n\n5\nShower\n\n2\n\nBathroom\n\nToilets\n\nKitchen\n\n3\nHall\n\nDoor closed\n\ni\n\n6\n1\nBedroom 3\n\nLiving room\n\nLevel 1 : Ground floor\n\nLevel 2 : First floor\n\nFigure 2: Pollutant emission and the measurement points within the experimental house.\n\n\fRESULTS\nCase 1: The results of experiment case 1, where all doors and apertures are kept closed, are\nillustrated on figure 3a) where indoor SF6 concentrations are shown according to time. As it can\nbe seen on the picture, concentration level in the living is very different from those of the other\nrooms. One can note some fluctuations on the curve representing pollutant concentration level in\nthe living room; in the other rooms, the curves evolve in a progressive way. Following these\nobservations, an averaged value of the release zone concentration was considered for the\nanalyses, and the maximum level for the other rooms.\nIn this way, about 8 ppm of SF6 was measured in bedroom 3 and 20 ppm in the other rooms of\nthe first floor, while the averaged concentration was round about 82 ppm in the living during the\nlast hour of emission period, and roughly 15 ppm in the kitchen. In this case, air flows seemed\nseems to be well driven by mechanical ventilation forces as soon as in two other tests bedroom 3\nconcentrations dropped to 1 ppm while values grew or remained almost the same in the rest of\nthe building (figure 3b)).\n\nSF6 concentration (ppm)\n\nPollutant concentrations for Case 1 (1st test)\n100\nLivingroom\n90\n\nKitchen\n\n80\n\nHall\n\n70\n\nBathroom\nShower\n\n60\n\nBedroom 3\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n6/30/05\n08:00\n\n6/30/05\n09:00\n\n6/30/05\n10:00\n\n6/30/05\n11:00\n\n6/30/05\n12:00\n\n6/30/05\n13:00\n\n6/30/05\n14:00\n\n6/30/05\n15:00\n\n6/30/05 6/30/05\n16:00\n17:00\nTime\n\n6/30/05\n18:00\n\na)\n\nSF6 concentration (ppm)\n\nPollutant concentrations for Case 1 (2nd test)\n100\n\nLivingroom\n90\n\nKitchen\n\n80\n\nHall\n\n70\n\nBathroom\n\n60\n\nShower\nBedroom 3\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n7/12/05\n08:00\n\n7/12/05\n09:00\n\n7/12/05\n10:00\n\n7/12/05\n11:00\n\n7/12/05\n12:00\n\n7/12/05\n13:00\n\n7/12/05\n14:00\n\n7/12/05\n15:00\n\n7/12/05\n16:00\n\n7/12/05\n17:00\nTime\n\n7/12/05\n18:00\n\nb)\n\nFigure 3: Pollutant concentrations within MARIA for experiment case 1. a) Test 1, b) Test 2.\n\n\fCase 2: When the orifices were open, the concentration in the living room decreased to about 64\nppm. But, 7 ppm was measured in bedroom 3, 14 ppm in the kitchen, and up to 20 ppm in the\nservice rooms at the first floor. Like in case 1, two complementary tests gave lower than 1 ppm\nof SF6 concentration in bedroom 3. The effects of air leakage openings was visible on living\nroom concentration but not in the bedroom.\nCase 3 and Case 4: The opening of internal doors in case 3 provoked a huge growth of\nconcentration in rooms at the first floor (figure 4). In bedroom 3, as well as in the bathroom and\nthe shower, it was measured 25 ppm, more than three times the former bedroom levels. The same\nrange of concentrations was found when the air leakage orifices were open in addition to the\ndoors, that is between 21 and 24 ppm (see figure 5).

The CVC principle can be considered well as operating when\ndoors are closed. R is about 0.50 for open door configurations, where a great quantity of pollutant\nwhere measured in the experimented bedroom. The depression due to mechanical ventilation\nbecomes insufficient to totally govern the flows between rooms.\nWhen analysing table 1, inside-outside temperature difference (\u0394TIO) effect on pollutant\nconcentration in bedroom 3 is clearly notable. In case 1, when \u0394TIO is 9\u00b0C, concentration is 8\nppm; for \u0394TIO below 3\u00b0C, concentration is only 1 ppm maximum. A similar observation can be\nmade in case 2. It therefore seems that stack effect also promotes the pollutant moving towards\nthe bedrooms, thus appearing that an important parameter of internal air flows.\n\n\fTable 1: Pollutant concentrations and the ratio R, weather conditions and air renewal rate.\nLiving room Bedroom\n(ppm)\n(ppm)\nCase 1 Test 1\nTest 2\nTest 3\nCase 2 Test 1\nTest 2\nTest 3\nCase 3 Test 1\nTest 2\nCase 4 Test 1\nTest 2\nCase 5 Test 1\nTest 2\n\n82\n72\n64\n64\n62\n55\n53\n55\n42\n40\n38\n41\n\n8\n1\n0\n7\n1\n2\n25\n22\n21\n22\n6\n8\n\nR\n0,10\n0,01\n0\n0,11\n0,02\n0,04\n0,47\n0,40\n0,50\n0,54\n0,16\n0,19\n\nTBed 3 (\u00b0C)\n29\n24\n26\n27\n22\n26\n26\n25\n26\n25\n20\n20\n\nText (\u00b0C) Wind (m/s) N (vol/h)\n20\n24\n24\n19\n25\n25\n24\n25\n19\n19\n16\n16\n\n2,4\n4\n2,1\n2,4\n3,6\n1,7\n2,1\n3,2\n3,4\n2,6\n3,2\n2,8\n\n0,35\n0,40\n0,47\n0,52\n0,59\n0,43\n0,57\n0,43\n1,08\n0,92\n1,36\n1,32\n\nInfiltration due to orifices opening and wind diluted pollutant concentration and increased air\nrenewal rate (N) in the living room. Factor N, evaluated by the decay method, averagely ranged\nfrom 0.40 volume per hour in case 1 to 0.50 vol/h in case 2. When doors were open in addition\nto holes, air change was twice that value. The opening of air leakage orifices resulted in a slight\ndecrease of concentration in the living room. Ratio R was not affected when passing from case1\nto case 2; moreover, if one considers that R values higher than 0.10 in these cases were only due\nto stack effect, infiltration influence on R declines under 4%. But, one can underline a slight raise\nof R from case 3 (0.40-0.47) to case 4 (0.50-0.54). Then, pollutant concentration in bedroom 3\nseemed to be sensitive to orifices opening, thus to infiltration, only when doors were open.\nWindow airing increased air change rate (1.32-1.36 vol/h) and diluted concentration in the whole\nhouse. Its effects were prevailing to mechanical ventilation. The values of R (0.16-0.19) and\nconcentrations showed that pollutant removal in this way was not too efficient.\nDISCUSSION\nThe tests performed in the experimental house MARIA upon French ventilation principle gave\nthe following results. The air flow routes were in agreement with the CVC principle as long as\nthe internal doors were closed. The opening of these doors disturbed a lot the air pattern since\ngreat quantity of the emitted pollutant was measured in the experimented bedroom. Beside that,\nstack effect promoted the pollutant moving towards the bedrooms for higher indoor-outdoor air\ntemperature differences. In addition, the results also showed that if the opening of the bedroom\nwindow increased the air change rate, it did not guarantee a good indoor air quality; and\ninfiltration due to the purpose-built orifices mostly affected concentration in the emission room.\nNevertheless, it seems important to recall some of the simplifications made during the\nexperiments: direct flow between living and kitchen was not permitted, the door was made air\ntight, and extraction in toilets was stooped. Furthermore the openings were equally distributed\nbetween the levels, and as well as possible between rooms, in order to represent a globally leaky\nbuilding envelope. Other configurations such as a more localised distribution of orifices can lead\nto different results. Concerning the method itself, as concentrations never reached steady state, it\nwould be interesting to see the influence of such a situation.\n\n\fDespite all, one must note that the CVC principle works well. However, it remains sensitive to\nnumbers of parameters, mainly the opening of the doors which is related to occupants' behaviour.\nIt then seems important to pay more attention to these disruptive factors in order to maintain the\nwell operating conditions. Otherwise, it should be interesting to think about other ventilation\nstrategies able to achieve the purposes of good indoor air quality, energy efficiency, and comfort.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank Professor Nachida Bourabaa from ENSIAME Engineering School,\nUniversity of Valenciennes (France) for her assistance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
