Introduction\nThe recent discovery of superconductivity at 26K in the iron oxypnictide LaFeAs(O, F)\n[1] has stimulated great interests among condensed-matter physics community. Tremendous\nwork was carried out, leading to the emergence of new iron-based superconductor families\nwith different crystal structures: 1111 (REFeAs(O, F)), 122 ((Ba, K)Fe2As2) [2], 111 (LiFeAs)\n[3] and 11 (Fe(Se, Te)) [4]. The REFeAs(O, F) superconductors, which has the highest Tc\nwhen La was replaced by Sm [5], crystallize in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group with two\nformula units per unit cell. The crystal structure consists of alternating RE-O and Fe-As layers\nstacked along the c axis. Since magnetic elements such as Fe and rare earth exist in this\nsystem, relevant questions have been raised about the relationship between magnetism and\nsuperconductivity. Neutron, muon spin rotation ( \u03bcSR ) and Mossbauer measurements [6, 7]\non undoped LaFeAsO have revealed commensurate spin density wave (SDW) order of the Fe\nmoments below TN =135K with amplitude of 0.35 \uf06d B . Superconductivity can be induced\nfrom the magnetically ordered parent compound by carrier doping, external and internal\npressure. Some measurements suggest that the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed upon\ndoping and the maximum Tc is achieved just as static magnetism disappears [6, 8]. Tarantini\net\n\nal\n\nexcluded\n\nthe\n\nlong-range\n\nantiferromagnetic\n\norder\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nsuperconducting\n\nNdFeAsO0.94F0.06 [9]. However, Drew et al detected magnetic fluctuations [10] and static\nmagnetism [11] coexisting in the SmFeAsO1-xFx by muon spin rotation, and Ryan et al\ndetected the coexistence of long-ranged magnetic order and superconductivity in\nSmFeAsO1-xFx by using neutron diffraction [12]. The coexistence of magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, and the role played by magnetism in the basic superconducting mechanism\n\n3\n\n\fneed to be further investigated both theoretically and experimentally.\nBesides the studies related to the superconducting mechanism, it is also necessary to\nstudy the influence of magnetism on superconductivity. Previous reports [9, 13, 14] have\nshown the modified electromagnetic behavior by magnetism in the 1111 system. In this paper,\nboth DC and AC magnetization measurements were performed. The influence of magnetism\nbackground on the superconducting properties is investigated systematically.\n\n2. Experimental\nThe superconducting NdFeAsO1-xFx sample was prepared directly by a high-pressure\n(HP) method similar to reference [15]. The starting materials were mixed according to the\nnominal stoichiometric ratio of NdFeAsO0.88F0.12, then ground thoroughly and pressed into\npellets. The pellets were sealed in boron nitride crucibles and sintered in a high pressure\nsynthesis apparatus under 6Gpa at the temperature of 1250\u00b0C for 2 hours. The HP sample has\nthe dimensions of 1.16 \uf0b4 1.88 \uf0b4 4.50 mm3, weights 58mg and is about 82% of the theoretical\ndensity (7.21g/cm3). The transition temperature Tc determined by resistivity measurements\n(not shown here) is about 51K and the resistivity \uf072 (Tc ) is about 2.04m\uf057cm.\nThe crystal structure of HP sample was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)\non an MXP18A-HF\u2013type diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation from 20\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 with a step of\n0.01\u25e6. As shown in Figure 1, all main peaks can be well indexed based on the ZrCuSiAs\ntetragonal structure, confirming the formation of NdFeAs(O, F) phase. No impurity peak was\nobserved.\nDC magnetization M(T) and M(H) measurements were performed using a vibrating\n\n4\n\n\fsample magnetometer (VSM) of a Quantum Design Model 6000 PPMS. Magnetic critical\ncurrent densities J cm were estimated using the Bean model from the M(H) hysteresis loops\n(MHLs).By using the same PPMS equipped with an AC susceptometer, the first harmonics of\nthe AC magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature were measured at various\nfrequencies \uf06e , AC magnetic field amplitudes hac and DC fields H dc , which was parallel to\nthe AC field. Before each measurement, the sample was warmed up to 60K to fully expel the\nflux trapped inside. Sufficient waiting time was adopted to ensure the thermal homogeneity.\nDuring both DC and AC measurements, the magnetic fields were applied along the longest\ndimension of the sample.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1\n\nThe DC magnetic susceptibilities\nThe DC magnetic susceptibilities \uf063 (T ) for HP sample were measured by zero-field\n\ncooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) under 15Oe, 5KOe, 7.5KOe and 15KOe. The results are\nplotted in Figure 2. Figure 2 (a) shows the \uf063 (T ) curves measured under 15Oe. The sharp\ndiamagnetic\n\nsuperconducting\n\ntransition\n\nindicates\n\nthe\n\ngood\n\nsample\n\nquality.\n\nThe\n\nsuperconducting shielding volume fraction is about 99%, confirming bulk superconductivity\nin this sample. The transition temperature Tc determined by the onset of diamagnetic signal\nis about 50K. Figure 2 (b) shows the \uf063 (T ) curves measured under 5KOe. The magnetic\nfields suppressed the superconducting diamagnetism, and a broad peak emerged in the ZFC\ncurve at about 11K. This peak was also detected in the \uf063 (T ) curve measured under 7.5KOe\nas shown in Figure 2 (c), where the ZFC curve became positive in the whole temperature\n\n5\n\n\frange due to the strong paramagnetic background. Similar behavior was reported by several\ngroups in Nd [9], Sm [14] and Pr [16] 1111 superconductors. What to our surprise is, the\n\n\uf063 (T ) shows an abnormal behavior that the ZFC curve went above FC curve between 10K\nand 25K. Further increase of the magnetic field to 15KOe results in the increase of the\nparamagnetic component and eliminated the peak. The ZFC curve, however, was still located\nabove the FC curve in the temperature range of 5 to 30K. This phenomenon so far to our\nknowledge has not been reported in the iron-based 1111 system.\nTo investigate the origin of this behavior, the paramagnetic background was evaluated\nand subtracted from the total susceptibilities. Assuming that the paramagnetic magnetic\nmoments of the Nd3+ ions do not interact with each other, the paramagnetic magnetization is\nexpected to be given by\n\nM pm \uf03d M 0 BJ ( g \uf06dB JB / kB (T \uf02b \uf051))\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the Lande factor, \uf06d B is the Bohr magneton, kB is the Boltzmann constant, BJ ( x)\nis the Brillouin function and M 0 \uf03d NgJ \uf06dB (N is the number of Nd ions per unit volume). A\nphenomenological parameter \uf051 \uf020was introduced because the electric crystal field (CEF)\nacting on Nd 4f electrons splits and mixes the degenerated JM J\n\nstates resulting in, for\n\ng \uf06d B JB / k BT \uf03d 1 , the modification of the Curie form \uf063 \uf03d C / T to the Curie-Weiss law,\n\uf063=C/(T+\uf051) [17]. According to the Russel-Saunders coupling model the ground state term of\nthe Nd3+ ion is\n\n4\n\nI 9/2 (J=9/2).\n\nThe M(T) curve measured from 50 to 300K under 7.5KOe was plotted in Figure 3 (a),\nshowing the Curie-Weiss behavior similar to [18]. The paramagnetic background of total\nmagnetization from 5 to 50K was obtained by fitting the measured M(T) curve using equation\n\n6\n\n\f(1) with parameter \uf051 \uf03d16K and M0V=3.26emu, where V is the sample volume. After\nsubtracting the paramagnetic background, the \uf063 (T ) curves under 5KOe, 7.5KOe and\n15KOe were shown in Figure 3 (b)-(d). The \uf063 (T ) curves under 5KOe and 7.5KOe show\nnegative values below the superconducting onset temperature, indicating the diamagnetic\neffect. Besides, four features can be clearly noted: (1) The FC \uf063 (T ) curves in Figure 3\n(b)-(d) raise up below 15K. This may be caused by the underestimating of the paramagnetic\ncomponent at low temperature, where the M pm value deviates from equation (1). (2) The\nZFC \uf063 (T ) curves under 5KOe and 7.5KOe drop dramatically at low temperatures as shown\nin Figure 3 (b) and (c). In a pervious report [16], this was explained by the onset of intergrain\nsuperconductivity. (3) The ZFC \uf063 (T ) curve shows a broad peak around 16K in Figure 3 (c).\n(4) Part of the FC \uf063 (T ) curve under 5KOe and 7.5KOe goes below ZFC curve shown in\nFigure 3 (c) and (d). As for feature (3) and (4), Tarantini et al suggested the possibility of spin\nglass in the Nd-1111 system [9]. Indeed, similar complex \uf063 (T ) behavior was observed on\nsome glassy system on a much smaller field scale [19, 20], indicating different ordering\nand/or freezing processes during ZFC and FC. In order to evaluate this possibility, AC\nmagnetic susceptibilities measurements were performed.\n\n3.2\n\nThe AC magnetic susceptibilities\nFigure 4 (a) shows the AC magnetic susceptibilities \uf063 ' and \uf063 '' as a function of\n\ntemperature at frequencies of 100Hz, 500Hz and 1kHz, for DC magnetic fields H dc =7.5KOe\nand the AC magnetic field hac =8Oe. As the frequency decreases, the transition temperature\nshifts to lower value, the peak height in \uf063 '' decreased as it moves to lower temperature.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 4 (b) shows the \uf063 '(T ) and \uf063 ''(T ) curves measured at the fixed frequency\n\n\uf06e =500Hz, hac =16Oe and at various H dc =50Oe, 150Oe, 500Oe, 5KOe and 7.5KOe. As the\ndc fields increase, the transition in \uf063 '(T ) and \uf063 ''(T ) becomes broad and the peak height\nin \uf063 '' decreased as it moves to lower temperature. These features are similar to that of\nhigh-temperature superconductors [21, 22] and can be explained by flux creep and the\ntemperature dependence of shielding currents [23]. In Figure 4 (a), however, \uf063 '' was\nfrequency independent in the temperature range of 25K to 30K but frequency dependent from\n5 to 25K. This cannot be explained by flux creeping, which is weaker in lower temperatures.\nMoreover, it is also noted that an abnormal behavior of \uf063 '' evolves with increasing H dc in\nFigure 4 (b). A weak peak in \uf063 '' at about 12K emerges when H dc =500Oe, and the peak\nseems to move below 5K when H dc reaches 5KOe. One may attribute this behavior to the\nsuperconducting intergranular component, corresponding to the drop of \uf063 value at about\n10K in Figure 3 (b) and (c). However, recent report [24] investigated the granularity in\nLaFeAsO0.92F0.08, showing that the intergranular component is much larger than the\nintragranular one. On the other hand, the peak in \uf063 '' caused by the intergranular weak links\ncan only be observed under low DC fields much smaller than 5KOe. Thus, the dissipation\npeak and the drop in dc \uf063 value below 10K are not likely caused by intergranular coupling\nat low temperatures, unless there exists small amount of 'medium links', which can survive\nunder more than 5KOe. We suggest that the abnormal behavior of \uf063 '' may be caused by the\nspin glass, which shows similar frequency dependence as \uf063 '' in Figure 4 (a) [25]. To fully\ninvestigate this possibility, further study in details is under process.\n\n8\n\n\f3.3\n\nMagnetic hysteresis loops\nFigure 5 (a) shows the magnetic hysteresis loops (MHLs) of the HP sample up to 1.5T at\n\nseveral temperatures from 5 to 25K. The MHLs shows a general behavior of superconductors\nthat the hysteresis loop width \uf044M decreases with increasing temperature. However, the\nMHLs were shifted to higher value by a paramagnetic background caused by Nd3+ ions,\nresulting in a crossover of MHLs at different temperatures in the field range of 5KOe to 1T.\nThis behavior was also observed in other reports [13, 18]. The experimentally measured\nmagnetization contains two components: irreversible superconducting magnetization M sc\nand paramagnetic magnetization M pm of Nd3+ ion.\n\nM \uf03d M sc \uf02b M pm\n\n(2)\n\nThe paramagnetic magnetization M(H) not masked by superconductivity was measured\nat 53K up to 9T as shown in the inset of Figure 5 (a). M0V=2.55emu of the sample was\ndetermined by fitting the M(H, 53K) curve using equation (1) with \uf051 =0 for simplicity. The\nparamagnetic background of total MHLs measured at 5 to 25K was then calculated using\nequation (1) with parameter \uf051 \uf03d7K to 9K. After subtracting M pm from measured MHLs,\nthe superconducting MHLs were obtained and shown in Figure 4 (b). After the paramagnetic\ncorrection the MHLs show no abnormal from 5KOe to 1T, so it seems that the crossover of\nMHLs is simply caused by a superposition of paramagnetic background on the\nsuperconducting irreversible magnetization. The magnetic background related to the possible\nspin glass and/or magnetic impurities have no contributions to the flux pinning property, thus\ndo not affect the MHLs.\nIt is noted that a centre peak appears in the MHLs at each temperature. Similar zero-field\n\n9\n\n\fpeak was also observed in NdFeAsO1-\uf064 system reported by Moore et al [26] and hight\ntemperature superconductors [27]. This centre peak is speculated to be caused by the\nexistence of the Bean-Livingston surface barrier [28], and will be investigated in detail\nelsewhere.\n\n3.4\n\nEffect of paramagnetism on J c\nBecause the distribution of the flux density in the sample during the increasing B \uf02d and\n\nduring the decreasing B \uf02b field process at the same applied field is different, the\n\uf02d\nparamagnetic magnetization during the increasing field process M pm\nand during the\n\uf02b\ndecreasing field process M pm\nshould be different as well. The Bean critical state model\n\nleads to the following expressions for the magnetization in the decreasing M \uf02b and in the\nincreasing M \uf02d field branches:\n\uf02b\nM \uf02b \uf03d \uf044M sc / 2 \uf02b M pm\n\n(3)\n\n\uf02d\nM \uf02d \uf03d \uf044M sc / 2 \uf02b M pm\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \uf044M sc \uf03d M sc\uf02b \uf02d M sc\uf02d is the magnetic hysteresis if there is no paramagnetic contribution,\nand\n\n\uf0b1\nM pm\n\n\uf0b1\nis the spatial average of M pm\n, respectively. From Equation (3) and (4) the\n\nwidth of the experimentally measured magnetic hysteresis \uf044M should be:\n\n\uf044M \uf03d \uf044M sc \uf02b \uf044M pm\n\n(5)\n\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\nwhere \uf044M pm \uf03d\uf03c M pm\n\uf03e \uf02d \uf03c M pm\n\uf03e . Considering a fully penetrated infinitely long slab of\n\nthickness d along the x axis and infinite in the yz plane with the magnetic field B parallel to\nthe z axis, and using the simple Bean critical state model with Equation (2), the field\ndependence of \uf044M pm can be deduced as [29]:\n\n10\n\n\f\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf044M pm ( H ) \uf03d\uf03c M pm\n\uf03e \uf02d \uf03c M pm\n\uf03e = M 0 (\uf03c BJ (\uf068 \uf02b ) \uf03e \uf02d \uf03c BJ (\uf068 \uf02d ) \uf03e)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \uf068 \uf03d g \uf06d B B \uf0b1 / kB (T \uf02b \uf051) , B \uf02d and B \uf02b is the flux density in the sample during the\nincreasing field and during the decreasing field process respectively, and \uf03c BJ (\uf068 \uf0b1 ) \uf03e is the\nspatial average of BJ (\uf068 \uf0b1 ) .\nAs can be seen from Equation (5), the intrinsic magnetic hysteresis \uf044M sc was\nbroadened by paramagnetism to the experimentally measured (total) magnetic hysteresis\n\n\uf044M . Therefore, total magnetization critical current density J tot \uf03d 20\uf044M / a(1 \uf02d a / 3b)\ndeviates from the intrinsic critical current density J cm \uf03d 20\uf044M sc / a (1 \uf02d a / 3b) , where a and\nb are thickness and width of the sample. The field dependence of the total J tot and intrinsic\n\nJ cm at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25K were plotted in Figure 5 (a) for comparison. \uf044J cm \uf03d J tot \uf02d J cm\ndecreases monotonically with applied field as shown in the inset of Figure 5 (a). Figure 5 (b)\nshows the temperature dependence of J tot and J cm at 2KOe, 5KOe, 7.5KOe and 12KOe.\nThe inset of Figure 5 (b) shows that \uf044J cm decreases quickly with increasing temperature. In\nFigure 5, it is obvious that J tot is larger than J cm at 5K. However in high field and high\ntemperature, \uf044J cm can be neglected, the intrinsic critical current density J cm can be well\napproximated by the total critical current density J tot . The reason is that in the high field and\nhigh temperature region, magnetic hysteresis decreases quickly due to weaken pinning, so the\ndistribution of the flux density in the sample during the increasing B- and during the\ndecreasing B+ field process at the same applied field is very close, resulting in much less\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\nand M pm\n. It is worth mention that the magnetic background\ndifference between M pm\n\nshows no influence on J cm in whole temperature range as shown in Figure 6 (b), confirming\nthat the magnetic background has no contribution to the flux pinning property in this sample.\n\n11\n\n\fThe possible reason is that the magnetic background is an intrinsic one distributing\nhomogeneously among the whole sample.\n\n4. Conclusions\nIn summary, the influence of magnetism on the superconducting properties of iron-based\nsuperconductor NdFeAsO0.88F0.12 was studied by means of both DC and AC magnetization\nmeasurements. Our results lead to following conclusions: (1) The anormal behavior of\ncurves under 7.5KOe, the ac field frequency dependency of\n\n\uf063 (T )\n\n\uf063 ''(T ) around 10K and the\n\nincreasing of dissipation with dc field H dc at low temperatures suggest the possibility of spin\nglass existing in this system. (2) The paramagnetism of Nd3+ ions tiled the magnetic hysteresis\nloops and broadened the hysteresis width, therefore the magnetization critical current J cm based\non the Bean critical state model deviated from the intrinsic value. The experimental critical current\ndensity J tot derived from MHLs is larger than the intrinsic critical current density J cm at low\ntemperatures. In high field and high temperature, the magnetism influence can be neglected, and\n\nJ cm can be well approximated by J tot . (3) The flux pinning property in this sample was not\naffected by the observed magnetic background, suggesting the background is intrinsic of this\nsystem.\n\nAcknowledge\nThis work was supported by the scientific research foundation of graduate school of\nSoutheast University (Grant No. YBJJ0933), by the Natural Science Foundation of China\n(NSFC, Grant No. 10804127), by the Cyanine-Project Foundation of Jiangsu Province of\n\n12\n\n\fChina (Grant No. 1107020060) and by the Foundation for Climax Talents Plan in Six-Big\nFields of Jiangsu Province of China (Grant No. 1107020070).\n\n13\n\n\fReference\n[1] Kamihara Y, Watanabe T, Hirano M and Hosono H 2008 J.
