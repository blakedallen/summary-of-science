In one of the earliest attempts, a Hamiltonian proportional to\nthe second order Casimir operator of suq (2) has been used for the description of rotational\nmolecular [8] and nuclear spectra [9] and its relation to the Variable Moment of Inertia\nModel [10] has been clarified.\nHowever, several open problems remained:\na) Is the suq (2) Hamiltonian invariant under the usual su(2) Lie algebra, i.e. under\nusual angular momentum, or it breaks spherical symmetry and/or the isotropy of space?\nb) How does the physical angular momentum appear in the framework of suq (2)? Is there\nany relation between the generators of suq (2) and the usual physical angular momentum\noperators?\n1\n\ne-mail:\ne-mail:\n3\ne-mail:\n4\ne-mail:\n2\n\nbonat@inp.demokritos.gr\nbkotsos@teilam.gr\nraychev@phys.uni-sofia.bg, raychev@inrne.bas.bg\nterziev@inrne.bas.bg\n\n1\n\n\fc) How can one add angular momenta in the suq (2) framework? In other words, how\ndoes angular momentum conservation work in the suq (2) framework?\nAnswers to these questions are provided in the present paper, along with connections\nof the suq (2) model to other formalisms.\nIn Section 2 a brief description of the q-deformed harmonic oscillator is given, while\nin Section 3 the connection between the q-deformed harmonic oscillator and the usual\nharmonic oscillator is established through the use of q-deforming boson functionals, a tool\nwhich will be needed in the framework of suq (2) as well. The suq (2) formalism is briefly\ndescribed in Section 4, while in Section 5 a representation of suq (2) in terms of q-deformed\nboson operators is given. Based on this boson representation the connection between the\nsuq (2) quantum algebra and the usual su(2) Lie algebra is established in Section 6 and\nused in Section 7 for proving explicitly that the suq (2) Hamiltonian does commute with the\ngenerators of su(2), i.e. with the generators of usual physical angular momentum. Therefore\nthe suq (2) Hamiltonian does not violate the isotropy of space and does not destroy spherical\nsymmetry. The suq (2) basis turns out to be identical to the usual su(2) basis in the boson\nrepresentation under discussion. In addition, it turns out that the angular momentum\nquantum numbers appearing in the description of the suq (2) states are exactly the same\nas the ones appearing in the states of su(2), establishing an one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the two sets of states (in the generic case in which the deformation parameter q is\nnot a root of unity).\nTaking advantage of the results of Section 7, we write in Section 8 the eigenvalues of\nthe suq (2) Hamiltonian as an exact power series in l(l + 1) (where l is the usual physical\nangular momentum). An approximation to this expansion, studied in Section 9, leads to a\nclosed energy formula for rotational spectra introduced by Amal'sky [11].\nWe then turn in Section 10 into the study of irreducible tensor operators under suq (2)\n[12, 13], constructing the irreducible tensor operator of rank one corresponding to the\nsuq (2) generators. We also define tensor products in the suq (2) framework and construct\nthe scalar square of the angular momentum operator, a task requiring the use of q-deformed\nClebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients [12]. In addition to exhibiting explicitly how addition of angular momenta works in the suq (2) framework, this exercise leads to a Hamiltonian built\nout of the components of the above mentioned irreducible tensor operator (ITO), which\ncan also be applied to the description of rotational spectra. We are going to refer to this\nHamiltonian as the suq (2) ITO Hamiltonian.\nThe fact that the suq (2) ITO Hamiltonian does commute with the generators of the\nusual su(2) algebra is shown explicitly in Section 11. Based on the results of Section 11,\nwe express in Section 12 the eigenvalues of the suq (2) ITO Hamiltonian as an exact power\nseries in l(l + 1), where l is the usual physical angular momentum. An approximation to\nthis series, studied in Section 13, leads to a simple closed formula for the spectrum (the\n\"hyperbolic tangent formula\").\nFinally in Section 14 all the exact and closed approximate energy formulae obtained\nabove are compared to the experimental spectrum of a rotational band of HF, which exhibits\nsizeable deviations from pure rotational behavior, as well as to the results provided by the\nusual rotational expansion and by the Holmberg\u2013Lipas formula [14], which is probably\nthe best two-parameter formula for the description of rotational nuclear spectra [15]. A\ndiscussion of the present results and plans for future work are given in Section 15.\n\n2\n\nThe q-Deformed Harmonic Oscillator\n\nThe q-deformed harmonic oscillator [5, 6, 7] is defined by means of the operators a\u2020 and a,\nwhich are referred to as q-deformed boson creation and annihilation operators, together with\n2\n\n\fthe q-deformed number operator N. These operators close the q-deformed Heisenberg\u2013Weyl\nalgebra\n(1)\n[a, a\u2020 ]q \u2261 aa\u2020 \u2212 qa\u2020 a = q \u2212N ,\n[a, a\u2020 ]q\u22121 \u2261 aa\u2020 \u2212 q \u22121 a\u2020 a = q N ,\n[N, a\u2020 ] = a\u2020 ,\n\n[N, a] = \u2212a.\n\n(2)\n\naa\u2020 = [N + 1],\n\n(3)\n\nFrom Eq. (1) one can easily see that the products of operators a and a\u2020 are equal to\na\u2020 a = [N],\n\nwhere the square brackets denote q-operators, defined as\n[X] =\n\nq X \u2212 q \u2212X\n.\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(4)\n\nq-numbers are also defined in the same way. For the deformation parameter q two different\ncases occur:\na) If q is real, one can write q = e\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is real. Then one immediately sees that\n[X] =\n\nsinh \u03c4 X\n.\nsinh \u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nb) If q is a phase factor (but not a root of unity, in which case one has q n = 1, with\nn \u2208 N), one can write q = ei\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is real. Then one has\n[X] =\n\nsin \u03c4 X\n.\nsin \u03c4\n\nIn both cases one has\n\n[X] \u2192 X as q \u2192 1.\nThere exists a state |0iq (called the q-vacuum) with the properties\na|0iq = 0,\n\nN|0iq = 0.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nActing on this state with the operator a\u2020 repeatedly, one can build up the states\n\nwhere the quantity\n\n(a\u2020 )n\n|niq = q\n|0iq ,\n[n]!\n[n]! = [n] [n \u2212 1] . . . [1]\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nis the q-factorial.\nThe states (9) form an orthonormal basis\n\nq hn|miq\n\n= \u03b4nm ,\n\n(11)\n\nand are eigenvectors of the q-deformed number operator\nN | niq = n | niq .\n\n(12)\n\nFrom the last equation it is clear why the states of Eq. (9) are interpreted as states\ncontaining n q-deformed bosons.\n3\n\n\f3\n\nConnection of the q-Deformed Oscillator to the\nUsual Harmonic Oscillator\n\nIn the limit q \u2192 1 (or \u03c4 \u2192 0) Eq. (1) is reduced into the commutation relation for usual\nboson creation and annihilation operators, for which the symbols b\u2020 and b will be used\ni\n\nh\n\nb, b\u2020 = 1.\n\n(13)\n\nFurthermore, in the limit q \u2192 1 Eq. (2) is reduced into the form\n[B, b\u2020 ] = b\u2020 ,\n\n[B, b] = \u2212b,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere by B we denote the number operator, for which the following analogues of Eq. (3)\nare valid\nb\u2020 b = B,\nbb\u2020 = B + 1.\n(15)\nIn analogy with Eq. (8) one can introduce the vacuum state |0ic (the \"classical\" vacuum)\nwith the properties\nb|0ic = 0,\nB|0ic = 0.\n(16)\nThen one can build up the states\n(b\u2020 )n\n|nic = \u221a |0ic,\nn!\n\n(17)\n\nwhich form an orthonormal basis\nc hn|mic\n\n= \u03b4nm ,\n\n(18)\n\nand are eigenstates of number operator B, i.e.\nB|nic = n|nic .\n\n(19)\n\nFrom the last equation it is clear that the states of Eq. (17) are states which contain n\nbosons. The analogy between the \"standard\" and the q-deformed case is clear.\nThere is however a closer relation between the operators a\u2020 (a) and b\u2020 (b). In the space\ndetermined by the vectors of Eq. (17) one can define the operators [16]\ns\n\n[B]\na=b\nB\n\na\u2020 =\n\nand\n\ns\n\n[B] \u2020\nb.\nB\n\n(20)\n\nIt should be noticed that the definitions of Eq. (20) are meaningful only in the space\nof vectors |nic , i.e. when the operators a\u2020 and a act on the vectors of Eq. (17). As\na consequence the operator B, which appears in the denominator of Eq. (20), can be\nreplaced by the number n only when a\u2020 or a act on |nic .\nOne can now calculate the bilinear products of a\u2020 and a\na\u2020 a =\n\ns\n\n[B] \u2020\nbb\nB |{z}\nB\n\n4\n\ns\n\n[B]\n= [B] ,\nB\n\n(21)\n\n\fs\n\ns\n\n[B] [B] \u2020\nb = [B + 1] .\n(22)\naa\u2020 = b\nB\nB\nIn the derivation of the last equation the fact that for an arbitrary function f (B) one has\nb\u2020 f (B) = f (B \u2212 1)b\u2020 ,\n\nand\n\nbf (B) = f (B + 1)b,\n\n(23)\n\nas well as Eq. (15) have been taken into account.\nFrom Eqs. (21) and (22) one can easily verify that\naa\u2020 \u2212 q \u22121 a\u2020 a = q B ,\n\naa\u2020 \u2212 qa\u2020 a = q \u2212B ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich coincide with Eq. (1). Furthermore using Eqs. (14) and (20) one can verify that\n[B, a\u2020 ] = a\u2020 ,\n\n[B, a] = \u2212a,\n\n(25)\n\nwhich coincide with Eq. (2). Therefore the operators of Eq. (20) can be considered as a\nrepresentation of the q-deformed boson operators in the usual (non-deformed) space |nic of\nEq. (17). The operators of Eq. (20) are referred to as q-deforming boson functionals. From\nEqs. (1) and (24) it is also clear that in this representation the operator N is represented\nby the operator B.\nOne can now build up the q-deformed oscillator states |niq in terms of q-deforming\nboson functionals. Starting from Eq. (9) and using Eq. (20) one has\n(a\u2020 )n\n\ns\n\ns\n\n[B] \u2020 [B] \u2020\n|niq = q\n|0iq = q\nb\nb ...\nB{z\n[n]!\n[n]! | B\n1\n\nn\n\nterms\n\ns\n\n[B] \u2020\nb |0ic .\nB }\n\n(26)\n\nMaking use of the first relation in Eq.

(17) has been used. We have therefore found that in this\nrepresentation the q-deformed oscillator states coincide with the standard oscillator states,\na quite remarkable result which will play an important role in what follows.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nThe Quantum Algebra suq (2)\n\nThe quantum algebra suq (2) [17, 18, 19] is a q-deformation of the Lie algebra su(2). It is\ngenerated by the operators L+ , L\u2212 , L0 , obeying the commutation relations (see [4] and\nreferences therein)\n[L0 , L\u00b1 ] = \u00b1L\u00b1 ,\n(28)\n[L+ , L\u2212 ] = [2L0 ] =\n\nq 2L0 \u2212 q \u22122L0\n,\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(29)\n\nwhere q-numbers and q-operators are defined as in Eq. (4).\nIf the deformation parameter q is not a root of unity (see the discussion preceding Eq.\nl\n(6)) the finite-dimensional irreducible representation D(q)\nof suq (2) is determined by the\nhighest weight vector |l, liq with\nL+ |l, liq = 0,\n(30)\nand the basis states |l, miq are expressed as\n|l, miq =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n[l + m]!\n(L\u2212 )l\u2212m |l, liq .\n[2l]![l \u2212 m]!\n\n(31)\n\nl\nThen the explicit form of the irreducible representation (irrep) D(q)\nof the suq (2) algebra is\ndetermined by the equations\n\nL\u00b1 |l, miq =\n\nq\n\n[l \u2213 m][l \u00b1 m + 1] |l, m \u00b1 1iq ,\n\nL0 |l, miq = m |l, miq ,\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nand the dimension of the corresponding representation is the same as in the non-deformed\nl\ncase, i.e. dimD(q)\n= 2l + 1 for l = 0, 21 , 1, 32 , 2 . . .\nThe second-order Casimir operator of suq (2) is\n1\n(q)\nC2 = (L+ L\u2212 + L\u2212 L+ + [2][L0 ]2 )\n2\n= L\u2212 L+ + [L0 ][L0 + 1] = L+ L\u2212 + [L0 ][L0 \u2212 1],\n\n(34)\n\nl\nwhile its eigenvalues in the space of the irreducible representation D(q)\nare [l][l + 1]\n(q)\n\nC2 |l, miq = [l][l + 1]|l, miq .\n\n(35)\n\nIt has been suggested that rotational spectra of diatomic molecules [8] and deformed nuclei (see [4, 9] and references therein) can be described by a phenomenological Hamiltonian\nbased on the symmetry of the quantum algebra suq (2)\nH=\n\nh\u03042 (q)\nC + E0 ,\n2J0 2\n\n(q)\n\n(36)\n\nwhere C2 is the second order Casimir operator of Eq. (34), J0 is the moment of inertia\nfor the non-deformed case q \u2192 1, and E0 is the bandhead energy for a given band.\n6\n\n\fThe eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of Eq. (36) in the basis of Eq. (31) are then\n(\u03c4 )\n\nEl\n\n= A[l][l + 1] + E0 ,\n\n(37)\n\nh\u03042\n2J0\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the definition\nA=\n\nhas been used for brevity.\nIn the case with q = e\u03c4 , \u03c4 \u2208 R the spectrum of the model Hamiltonian of Eq. (36)\ntakes the form\nsinh(l\u03c4 ) sinh((l + 1)\u03c4 )\n(\u03c4 )\nEl = A\n+ E0 ,\nq = e\u03c4 ,\n(39)\n2\nsinh (\u03c4 )\nwhile in the case with q = ei\u03c4 , \u03c4 \u2208 R and q n 6= 1, n \u2208 N the spectrum of the model\nHamiltonian of Eq. (36) takes the form\n(\u03c4 )\n\nEl\n\n=A\n\nsin(l\u03c4 ) sin((l + 1)\u03c4 )\n+ E0 ,\nsin2 (\u03c4 )\n\nq = ei\u03c4 .\n\n(40)\n\nIt is known (see [4, 8, 9] and references therein) that only the spectrum of Eq. (40)\nexhibits behavior that is in agreement with experimentally observed rotational bands.\n\n5\n\nRepresentation of suq (2) in Terms of q-Deformed\nBoson Operators\n\nIt has been found [5, 6] that the suq (2) algebra of the last section can be represented in\nterms of two q-deformed boson operators like the ones introduced in Sec. 2. Indeed, one\ncan consider as \"building blocks\" the independent q-deformed operators a\u2020i and ai , with\ni = 1, 2, which satisfy the commutation relations\nai a\u2020i \u2212 q \u00b11 a\u2020i ai = q \u2213Ni ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere Ni , i = 1, 2 are the corresponding q-deformed number operators, satisfying the\ncommutation relations\n[Ni , a\u2020i ] = a\u2020i ,\n[Ni , ai ] = \u2212ai .\n(42)\nOne can then verify that the operators\nL+ = a\u20201 a2 ,\n\n1\nL0 = (N1 \u2212 N2 ),\n2\n\nL\u2212 = a1 a\u20202 ,\n\n(43)\n\ndo satisfy the commutation relations of Eqs. (28) and (29). In other words, Eq. (43)\nexpresses a representation of the generators of suq (2) in terms of q-deformed bosons.\nIn this representation the basis states are expressed as\n|n1 iq |n2 iq =\n\n(a\u2020 )n1 (a\u20202 )n2\n\nq1\n\n[n1 ]!\n\n7\n\nq\n\n[n2 ]!\n\n|0iq .\n\n(44)\n\n\fWith the identification\n\nn1 = l + m,\n\nn2 = l \u2212 m,\n\nthe basis states are put into the form\n(a\u20201 )l+m\n\n(a\u20202 )l\u2212m\n\nq\n|0iq ,\n|l, miq = q\n[l + m]! [l \u2212 m]!\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nwhile the highest weight vector is\n(a\u2020 )2l\n|l, liq = q 1 |0iq .\n[2l]!\n\n(47)\n\nOne can verify that the action of the operators of Eq. (43) on the states of Eq. (46) is\ndescribed by Eqs. (32) and (33).\n\n6\n\nConnection of suq (2) to the Lie Algebra su(2)\n\nIn this section we are going to use both the usual quantum mechanical operators of angular\nmomentum, related to the Lie algebra su(2) and denoted by l+ , l\u2212 , l0 , and the q-deformed\nones, which are related to suq (2) and denoted by L+ , L\u2212 , L0 , as in Sections 4 and 5. For\nbrevity we are going to call the operators l+ , l\u2212 , l0 \"classical\", while the operators L+ , L\u2212 ,\nL0 will be called \"quantum\". For the \"classical\" basis the symbol |l, mic will be used, while\nthe \"quantum\" basis will be denoted by |l, miq , as in Sections 4 and 5. Therefore l and m\nare the quantum numbers related to the usual quantum mechanical angular momentum,\nwhich is characterized by the su(2) symmetry, while l and m are the quantum numbers\nrelated to the deformed angular momentum, which is characterized by the suq (2) symmetry.\nThe \"classical\" operators satisfy the usual su(2) commutation relations\n[l0 , l\u00b1 ] = \u00b1l\u00b1 ,\n\n[l+ , l\u2212 ] = 2l0 ,\n\n(48)\n\nwhile the finite-dimensional irreducible representation D l of su(2) is determined by the\nhighest weight vector |l, lic with\nl+ |l, lic = 0,\n(49)\nand the basis states |l, mic are expressed as\n|l, mic =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n(l + m)!\n(l\u2212 )l\u2212m |l, lic .\n(2l)!(l \u2212 m)!\n\n(50)\n\nThe action of the generators of su(2) on the vectors of the \"classical\" basis is described by\nl\u00b1 |l, mic =\n\nq\n\n(51)\n\nl0 |l, mic = m|l, mic ,\n\n(52)\n\n(l \u2213 m)(l \u00b1 m + 1)|l, m \u00b1 1ic ,\n\nthe dimension of the corresponding representation being dimD l = 2l + 1 for l = 0, 21 , 1, 23 ,\n2, . . .\n8\n\n\fThe second order Casimir operator of su(2) is\n1\nC2 = (l+ l\u2212 + l\u2212 l+ ) + l02 = l\u2212 l+ + l0 (l0 + 1) = l+ l\u2212 + l0 (l0 \u2212 1),\n2\n\n(53)\n\nwhere the symbol 1 is used for the unit operator, while its eigenvalues in the space of the\nirreducible representation D l are l(l + 1)\nC2 |l, mic = l(l + 1)|l, mic .\n\n(54)\n\nOne can build a representation of su(2) in terms of independent boson operators, for\nwhich the symbols b\u2020i and bi , with i = 1, 2 will be used, in a way similar to the one used in\nSec. 3 for the harmonic oscillator. Indeed in the limit q \u2192 1 Eq. (41) is reduced into the\nusual commutation relation for independent boson operators\n[bi , b\u2020i ] = 1,\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(55)\n\nwhile Eq. (42) takes the form\n[Bi , b\u2020i ] = b\u2020i ,\n\n[Bi , bi ] = \u2212bi ,\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere by Bi we denote the number operators, for which the following relations are valid\nbi b\u2020i = Bi + 1,\n\nb\u2020i bi = Bi ,\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(57)\n\nFurthermore in the limit q \u2192 1 Eq. (43) is reduced into\nl+ = b\u20201 b2 ,\n\nl\u2212 = b1 b\u20202 ,\n\n1\nl0 = (B1 \u2212 B2 ),\n2\n\n(58)\n\nwhich is the well known Schwinger realization of su(2). In other words, a representation of\nthe generators of su(2) in terms of boson operators is obtained. One can verify that the\noperators given in Eq. (58) do satisfy the commutation relations of Eq. (48).\nIn this representation the basis states are expressed as\n(b\u2020 )n1 (b\u20202 )n2\n\u221a\n|n1 ic |n2 ic = \u221a1\n|0ic ,\nn1 ! n2 !\n\n(59)\n\nwhich can be viewed as the q \u2192 1 limit of Eq. (44). With the identification\nn1 = l + m,\n\nn2 = l \u2212 m,\n\n(60)\n\nthe basis states are put into the form\n(b\u2020 )l+m (b\u20202 )l\u2212m\nq\n|l, mic = q 1\n|0ic ,\n(l + m)! (l \u2212 m)!\n\n(61)\n\nwhich can be seen as the q \u2192 1 limit of Eq. (46).\nOne can easily verify that the operators of Eq. (58) act on the states of Eq. (61) in the\nway described by Eqs. (51) and (52).\n9\n\n\fOne can now consider the connection between the \"quantum\" basis of Eq. (44) and the\n\"classical\" basis of Eq. (59). Using Eq. (27) one has\n(b\u2020 )n1 (b\u20202 )n2\n(a\u2020 )n1 (a\u20202 )n2\nq\n\u221a\n|0iq = \u221a1\n|n1 iq |n2 iq = q 1\n|0ic = |n1 ic |n2 ic ,\nn1 ! n2 !\n[n1 ]! [n2 ]!\n\nor, in more compact form,\n\n|n1 iq |n2 iq = |n1 ic |n2 ic .\n\n(62)\n\n(63)\n\nIn other words, in this boson representation the \"quantum\" states of suq (2) coincide with\nthe \"classical\" states of su(2). A direct consequence of this result is obtained by solving\nEqs. (45) for l and m\nn1 \u2212 n2\nn1 + n2\n,\nm=\n,\n(64)\nl=\n2\n2\nand (60) for l and m\nn1 \u2212 n2\nn1 + n2\n,\nm=\n.\n(65)\nl=\n2\n2\nThe fact that the \"quantum\" states and the \"classical\" states coincide, as seen in Eq. (63),\nmeans that from Eqs. (64) and (65) one obtains\nl=l=\n\nn1 + n2\n,\n2\n\nm=m=\n\nn1 \u2212 n2\n.\n2\n\n(66)\n\nIn other words, the quantum numbers l and m, appearing in the \"quantum\" states, are\nidentical with the quantum numbers of the physical angular momentum, l and m, appearing\nin the \"classical\" states. It should be remembered that these conclusions are valid in the\ncase of q being not a root of unity, as already mentioned in Secs. 2 and 4.\nIn view of these remarks and using the identifications of Eqs. (45) and (60) one can put\nEq. (63) into the form\n(b\u2020 )l+m (b\u20202 )l\u2212m\n(a\u2020 )l+m (a\u20202 )l\u2212m\nq\nq\n|0iq = q 1\n= |l, mic ,\n|l, miq = q 1\n[l + m]! [l \u2212 m]!\n(l + m)! (l \u2212 m)!\n\nor, in more compact form,\n\n|l, miq = |l, mic .\n\n(67)\n\n(68)\n\nThe action of the generators and of the second-order Casimir operator of suq (2) on the\n\"classical\" states can be seen using Eqs. (32), (33), (35), (66), and (68)\nL\u00b1 |l, mic = L\u00b1 |l, miq =\n\nq\n\n[l \u2213 m][l \u00b1 m + 1]|l, m \u00b1 1iq =\n\nor, in short,\nL\u00b1 |l, mic =\nand in a completely analogous way\n\nq\n\nq\n\n[l \u2213 m][l \u00b1 m + 1]|l, m \u00b1 1ic ,\n(69)\n\n[l \u2213 m][l \u00b1 m + 1]|l, m \u00b1 1ic ,\n\nL0 |l, mic = m|l, mic ,\n(q)\n\nC2 |l, mic = [l][l + 1]|l, mic .\n10\n\n(70)\n\n(71)\n(72)\n\n\fIn a similar way one can obtain from Eqs. (51), (52), (54), (66), and (68) the action of\nthe generators and of the second-order Casimir operator of su(2) on the \"quantum\" states\nl\u00b1 |l, miq =\n\nq\n\n(73)\n\nl0 |l, miq = m|l, miq ,\n\n(74)\n\n(l \u2213 m)(l \u00b1 m + 1)|l, m \u00b1 1iq ,\n\nC2 |l, miq = l(l + 1)|l, miq .\n\n(75)\n\nAs a by-product, one can now show that the operators L\u0302+ and \u02c6l+ do not commute\n[L\u0302+ , \u02c6l+ ]|l, mic = L\u0302+ \u02c6l+ |l, mic \u2212 \u02c6l+ L\u0302+ |l, mic\nq\n\nq\n\n= L\u0302+ (l \u2212 m)(l + m + 1)|l, m + 1ic \u2212 \u02c6l+ [l \u2212 m][l + m + 1]|l, m + 1ic\n\n\u2212\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n= ( [l \u2212 m \u2212 1][l + m + 2] (l \u2212 m)(l + m + 1)\nq\n\n(l \u2212 m \u2212 1)(l + m + 2) [l \u2212 m][l + m + 1])|l, m + 2ic 6= 0.\n\nIn the same way one can see that\n\n[L\u0302\u2212 , \u02c6l\u2212 ]|l, mic 6= 0.\n\n(76)\n\n(77)\n\nIt should be mentioned at this point that the direct connection between the generators of\nsuq (2) and the generators of su(2) has been given in terms of q-deforming functionals in\nRefs. [20, 21], without any use of boson representations.\n\n7\n\nRotational Invariance of the suq (2) Hamiltonian\n(q)\n\nUsing Eqs. (70), (72) one can verify that the operator C2 commutes with the generators\n(q)\nL+ , L\u2212 , L0 of suq (2), i.e. that C2 is the second order Casimir operator of suq (2). Indeed\none has\n(q)\n(q)\n(q)\n[C2 , L+ ]|l, mic = C2 L+ |l, mic \u2212 L+ C2 |l, mic\n(q)\n\n= C2\nq\n\nq\n\n[l \u2212 m][l + m + 1]|l, m + 1ic \u2212 L+ [l][l + 1]|l, mic\nq\n\n= [l][l + 1] [l \u2212 m][l + m + 1]|l, m + 1ic \u2212 [l \u2212 m][l + m + 1][l][l + 1]|l, m + 1ic = 0. (78)\nIn exactly the same way one can prove that\n(q)\n\n[C2 , L\u0302\u2212 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n(79)\n\nwhile in addition, using Eqs.

We are now going to prove that the operator C2 commutes also with the generators\nl+ , l\u2212 , l0 of the usual su(2) algebra. Indeed using Eqs.

(52) and (72).\nThe following comments are now in place:\n(q)\na) The fact that the operator C2 commutes with the generators of su(2) implies that\nthis operator is a function of the second order Casimir operator of su(2), given in Eq. (53).\n(q)\nAs a consequence, it should be possible to express the eigenvalues of C2 , which are [l][l + 1]\n(as we have seen in Eq. (72) ), in terms of the eigenvalues of C2 , which are l(l + 1) (as we\nhave seen in Eq. (54) ). This task will be undertaken in the next section.\nb) Eqs. (81)-(83) also tell us that the Hamiltonian of Eq. (36) commutes with the\ngenerators of the usual su(2) algebra, i.e. it is rotationally invariant. The Hamiltonian of\nEq. (36) does not break rotational symmetry. It corresponds to a function of the second\norder Casimir operator of the usual su(2) algebra. This function, however, has been chosen\nin an appropriate way, in order to guarantee that the Hamiltonian of Eq. (36) is also\ninvariant under a more complicated symmetry, namely the symmetry suq (2).\n\n8\n\nExact Expansion of the suq (2) Spectrum\n\nLet us consider the spectrum of Eq. (40), which has been found relevant to rotational\nmolecular and nuclear spectra, assuming for simplicity E0 = 0 and \u03c4 > 0. Since the\nHamiltonian of Eq. (36) is invariant under su(2), as we have seen in the previous section, it\nshould be possible in principle to express it as a function of the Casimir operator C2 of the\nusual su(2) algebra. As a consequence, it should also be possible to express the eigenvalues\nof this Hamiltonian, given in Eq. (40), as a function of the eigenvalues of the Casimir\noperator of the usual su(2), i.e. as a function of l(l + 1). This is at first sight a nontrivial\ntask, since in Eq. (40) two different functions of the variable l appear, while we are in need\nof a single function of the variable l(l + 1), which is related to the length of the angular\nmomentum vector. In order to represent the expression of Eq. (40) as a power series of the\nvariable l(l + 1), one can use the identity\nsin(l\u03c4 ) sin((l + 1)\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n{cos(\u03c4 ) \u2212 cos((2l + 1)\u03c4 )} .\n2\n\n(84)\n\nThe last expression is an even function of (2l + 1). Therefore it is possible to express it as\na power series in (2l + 1)2 = 4l(l + 1) + 1. It turns out that the coefficients of the relevant\n12\n\n\fexpansion in powers of l(l + 1) can be expressed in terms of the spherical Bessel functions\nof the first kind jn (x) [22], which are determined through the generating function\n\u221e\n\u221a\nX\n1\ntn\ncos x2 \u2212 2xt =\njn\u22121 (x) ,\nx\nn!\nn=0\n\n(85)\n\nand are characterized by the asymptotic behavior\njn (x) \u2248\n\nxn\n,\n(2n + 1)!!\n\nx \u226a 1.\n\n(86)\n\nPerforming the substitutions\nx = \u03c4,\nwhich imply\n\nt = \u22122\u03c4 l(l + 1),\n\n(87)\n\nx2 \u2212 2xt = \u03c4 2 (2l + 1)2 ,\n\n(88)\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22122\u03c4 )n\n1\ncos((2l + 1)\u03c4 ) =\njn\u22121 (\u03c4 ) {l(l + 1)}n ,\n\u03c4\nn!\nn=0\n\n(89)\n\none gets the expression\n\nwhich in the special case of l = 0 reads\n1\ncos \u03c4 = j\u22121 (\u03c4 ),\n\u03c4\n\n(90)\n\ncos x\n.\nx\n\n(91)\n\nin agreement with the definition [22]\nj\u22121 (x) =\n\nSubstituting Eqs.

In this discussion we limit ourselves to real values of q, i.e. to q = e\u03c4\nwith \u03c4 being real, as in Refs. [12, 13].\n(q)\nAn irreducible tensor operator of rank k is the set of 2k + 1 operators Tk,\u03ba (\u03ba = k, k \u2212 1,\nk \u2212 2, . . ., \u2212k), which satisfy with the generators of the suq (2) algebra the commutation\nrelations [12, 13]\n(q)\n(q)\n[L0 , Tk,\u03ba ] = \u03baTk,\u03ba ,\n(101)\n(q)\n\n[L\u00b1 , Tk,\u03ba ]q\u03ba =\nwhere q-commutators are defined by\n\nq\n\n(q)\n\n[k \u2213 \u03ba][k \u00b1 \u03ba + 1]Tk,\u03ba\u00b11 q \u2212L0 ,\n\n[A, B]q\u03b1 = AB \u2212 q \u03b1 BA.\n\n(102)\n\n(103)\n\nIt is clear that in the limit q \u2192 1 these commutation relations reduce to the usual ones,\nwhich occur in the definition of irreducible tensor operators under su(2). It should also be\nnoticed that the operators\n(q)\n(q)\nRk,\u03ba = (\u22121)\u03ba q \u2212\u03ba (Tk,\u2212\u03ba )\u2020 ,\n(104)\nwhere \u2020 denotes Hermitian conjugation, satisfy the same commutation relations (101), (102)\n(q)\n(q)\nas the operators Tk,\u03ba , i.e. the operators Rk,\u03ba also form an irreducible tensor operator of\nrank k under suq (2).\nWe can construct an irreducible tensor operator of rank 1 using as building blocks the\ngenerators of suq (2). This irreducible tensor operator will consist of the operators J+1 , J\u22121 ,\nJ0 , which should satisfy the commutation relations\n[L0 , Jm ] = mJm ,\n[L\u00b1 , Jm ]qm =\n\n(105)\n\nq\n\n[1 \u2213 m][2 \u00b1 m]Jm\u00b11 q \u2212L0 ,\n\n(106)\n\nwhich are a special case of Eqs.

It turns out [12, 13, 23] that the explicit form of the\nrelevant operators is\n1\nJ+1 = \u2212 q q \u2212L0 L+ ,\n(108)\n[2]\n1\nJ\u22121 = q q \u2212L0 L\u2212 ,\n[2]\n\nJ0 =\n\n(109)\n\n\u0011\n1\n1 \u0010\n(q)\nq[2L0 ] + (q \u2212 q \u22121 )(C2 \u2212 [L0 ][L0 + 1]) ,\n(qL+ L\u2212 \u2212 q \u22121 L\u2212 L+ ) =\n[2]\n[2]\n\n(110)\n\nwhile the Hermitian conjugate operators are\n(J+1 )\u2020 = \u2212q \u22121 J\u22121 ,\n\n(J\u22121 )\u2020 = \u2212qJ+1 ,\n15\n\n(J0 )\u2020 = J0 .\n\n(111)\n\n\fIt is clear that in the limit q \u2192 1 these results reduce to the usual expressions for spherical\ntensors of rank 1 under su(2), formed out of the usual angular momentum operators\nlx + ily\nl+\nJ+ = \u2212 \u221a = \u2212 \u221a ,\n2\n2\n(J+ )\u2020 = \u2212J\u2212 ,\n\nl\u2212\nlx \u2212 ily\nJ\u2212 = \u221a = \u221a ,\n2\n2\n(J\u2212 )\u2020 = \u2212J+ ,\n\nJ 0 = l0 ,\n\n(J0 )\u2020 = J0 .\n\n(112)\n(113)\n\nThe commutation relations among the operators J+1 , J\u22121 , J0 can be obtained using\nEqs. (108)-(110) and (105), (106), as well as the fact that from Eq. (28) one has\n[L0 , L+ ] = L+ \u21d2 L0 L+ = L+ (L0 + 1) \u21d2 f (L0 )L+ = L+ f (L0 + 1),\n\n(114)\n\n[L0 , L\u2212 ] = \u2212L\u2212 \u21d2 L0 L\u2212 = L\u2212 (L0 \u2212 1) \u21d2 f (L0 )L\u2212 = L\u2212 f (L0 \u2212 1),\n\n(115)\n\nwhere f (x) is any function which can be written as a Taylor expansion in powers of x.\nIndeed one finds\n[J+1 , J0 ] = \u2212q \u22122L0 +1 J+1 ,\n\n[J\u22121 , J0 ] = q \u22122L0 \u22121 J\u22121 ,\n\n[J+1 , J\u22121 ] = \u2212q \u22122L0 J0 .\n\n(116)\n\nIn the limit q \u2192 1 these results reduce to the usual commutation relations related to\nspherical tensor operators under su(2)\n[J+ , J0 ] = \u2212J+ ,\n\n[J\u2212 , J0 ] = J\u2212 ,\n\n[J+ , J\u2212 ] = \u2212J0 .\n\n(117)\n\nIt is clear that the commutation relations of Eq. (116) are different from these of Eqs. (28),\n(29), as it is expected since the commutation relations of Eq. (117) are different from the\nusual commutation relations of su(2), given in Eq. (48).\nOne can now try to build out of these operators the scalar square of the angular momentum operator. For this purpose one needs the definition of the tensor product of two\nirreducible tensor operators, which has the form [12, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26]\n(q)\n\n(q) (1/q)\n\n[Aj1 \u2297 Bj2 ]j,m =\n\nX\n\nm1 ,m2\n\n(q)\n\n(q)\n\nhj1 m1 j2 m2 |jmi1/q Aj1 ,m1 Bj2 ,m2 .\n(q)\n\n(118)\n\n(q)\n\nOne should observe that the irreducible tensor operators Aj1 and Bj2 , which correspond\nto the deformation parameter q, are combined into a new irreducible tensor operator\n(q)\n(q) (1/q)\n[Aj1 \u00d7 Bj2 ]j,m , which corresponds to the deformation parameter 1/q, through the use\nof the deformed Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients hj1 m1 j2 m2 |jmi1/q , which also correspond to\nthe deformation parameter 1/q.\nAnalytic expressions for several q-deformed Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients, as well as their\nsymmetry proporties, can be found in Refs.

Furthermore\nthe last expression in Eq.

(127) ) is a function of the second order Casimir operator\n(q)\nof suq (2), C2 , which was proved to be rotationally invariant in Section 7.\nSince the Hamiltonian of Eq. (134) is rotationally invariant, it should be possible to\nexpress it as a function of C2 (the second order Casimir operator of su(2) ). It should also\nbe possible to express the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of Eq. (134) as a function of\nl(l + 1), i.e. as a function of the eigenvalues of C2 . This task will be undertaken in the\nfollowing section.\nFor completeness we mention that using Eqs. (70), (71), and (144) one can prove in an\nanalogous way that\n[H, L+ ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n[H, L\u2212 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n[H, L0 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n(147)\n\ni.e. that the Hamiltonian of Eq. (134) commutes with the generators of suq (2) as well.\nThen from Eqs. (108)-(110) it is clear that in addition one has\n[H, J+ ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n[H, J\u2212 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n[H, J0 ]|l, mic = 0.\n\n(148)\n\n[H, J0\u2032 ]|l, mic = 0.\n\n(149)\n\nThen from Eqs. (129) and (143) one furthermore obtains\n[H, J+\u2032 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n[H, J\u2212\u2032 ]|l, mic = 0,\n\n20\n\n\f12\n\nExact Expansion of the suq (2) ITO Spectrum\n\nSince the Hamiltonian of Eq. (134) is invariant under su(2), as we have seen in the last\nsection, it should be possible to write its eigenvalues (given in Eq. (139) ) as an expansion\nin terms of l(l + 1). At this point it is useful to observe that in Eq. (139) an even function\nof the variable (2l + 1) appears, which can therefore be expressed as a power series in\n(2l + 1)2 = 4l(l + 1) + 1.

The data are taken from the R branch (l \u2192 l + 1) and the P branch (l \u2192 l \u2212 1)\nof Ref. [27], using the equations [28]\nElR \u2212 ElP = El+1 (v = 1) \u2212 El\u22121 (v = 1),\n\n(180)\n\nP\nElR \u2212 El+2\n= El+2 (v = 0) \u2212 El (v = 0),\n\n(181)\n\nE = Al(l + 1) + B(l(l + 1))2 + C(l(l + 1))3 + D(l(l + 1))4 + . . . ,\n\n(182)\n\nwhere v is the vibrational quantum number. The purpose of this study is two-fold:\na) To test the quality of the approximations used in Secs. 9 and 13.\nb) To test the agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data.\nThe standard rotational expansion,\n\nfrom which only the first two terms will be included in order to keep the number of parameters equal to two, as well as the Holmberg\u2013Lipas two-parameter expression [14]\nq\n\nE = a( 1 + bl(l + 1) \u2212 1),\n24\n\n(183)\n\n\fwhich is known to give the best fits to experimental rotational nuclear spectra among all\ntwo-parameter expressions [15], will be included in the test for comparison. For brevity we\nare going to use the following terminology:\nModel I for Eq. (40) (original suq (2) formula),\nModel I\u2032 for Eq. (99) (\"the sinus formula\"),\nModel II for Eq. (139) (\"the suq (2) irreducible tensor operator (ITO) formula\"),\nModel II\u2032 for Eq. (178) (\"the hyperbolic tangent formula\"),\nModel III for Eq. (182) (the standand rotational formula), and\nModel IV for Eq. (183) (the Holmberg\u2013Lipas formula).\nIt should be emphasized at this point that in models I and I\u2032 the deformation parameter\nis a phase factor (q = ei\u03c4 , \u03c4 real), while in models II and II\u2032 the deformation parameter is\na real number (q = e\u03c4 , \u03c4 real). A consequence of this fact is the presence of trigonometric\nfunctions in models I and I\u2032 , while in models II and II\u2032 hyperbolic functions appear.\nThe parameters resulting from the relevant least square fits, together with the quality\nmeasure\nv\nu\nmax\nu 2 lX\n(Eexp (l) \u2212 Eth (l))2 ,\n(184)\n\u03c3=t\nlmax i=2\n\nwhere lmax is the angular momentum of the highest level included in the fit, are listed in\nTable 1, while in Table 2 the theoretical predictions of all models for the v = 0 band of HF\nare listed together with the experimental spectrum.\nFrom these tables the following observations can be made:\na) As seen in Tables 1 and 2, models I and I\u2032 give results which are almost identical.\nThe same is true for models II and II\u2032 . We therefore conclude that the approximations\ncarried out in Secs. 5 and 10 are very accurate.\nb) Models II and II\u2032 appear to give the best results, followed by models I and I \u2032 . Model\nIII gives reasonable results, while model IV gives the worst ones, a result which comes as a\nslight surprise, since model IV is known to provide the best fits of nuclear rotational spectra\n[15].\nThese observations lead to the following conclusions:\na) One can freely use model I\u2032 in the place of model I, and model II\u2032 in the place of\nmodel II, since the relevant approximations turn out to be very accurate. Models I\u2032 and II\u2032\nhave the advantage of providing simple analytic expressions for the energy.\nb) The fact that models II and II\u2032 are better than models I and I\u2032 indicates that within\nthe same symmetry (suq (2) in this case) it is possible to construct different rotational\nHamiltonians characterized by different degrees of agreement with the data.\nc) The relative failure of Model IV for molecular rotational spectra can be attributed\nto the fact that this model has been derived [14] from a Bohr\u2013Mottelson Hamiltonian [29],\nwhich is certainly very appropriate for describing nuclear rotational spectra, but it is not\nnecessarily equally appropriate for the description of molecular rotational spectra.\n\n15\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main results of the present work are the following:\na) The rotational invariance of the original suq (2) Hamiltonian [8, 9, 10] under the usual\nphysical angular momentum has been proved explicitly and its connection to the formalism\nof Amal'sky [11] (\"the sinus formula\") has been given.\nb) An irreducible tensor operator (ITO) of rank one under suq (2) has been found and\nused, through q-deformed tensor product and q-deformed Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficient techniques [12, 13, 24, 25], for the construction of a new Hamiltonian appropriate for the\ndescription of rotational spectra, the suq (2) ITO Hamiltonian. The rotational invariance\n25\n\n\fof this new Hamiltonian under the usual physical angular momentum has been proved explicitly. Furthermore, an approximate simple closed expression (\"the hyperbolic tangent\nformula\") for the energy spectrum of this Hamiltonian has been found.\nFrom the results of the present work it is clear that the suq (2) Hamiltonian, as well\nas the suq (2) ITO Hamiltonian, are complicated functions of the Casimir operator of the\nusual su(2), i.e. of the square of the usual physical angular momentum. These complicated\nfunctions possess the suq (2) symmetry, in addition to the usual su(2) symmetry. Matrix\nelements of these functions can be readily calculated in the deformed basis, but also in the\nusual physical basis. A similar study of a q-deformed quadrupole operator is called for.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge support from the Bulgarian Ministry of Science and Education\nunder Contracts No. \u03a6-415 and \u03a6-547.\n\nReferences\n[1] Chari, V.; Pressley, A.
