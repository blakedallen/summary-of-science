If the figure describes the sub-solar region, the vertical direction in\nthe figure is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic and the left side of the figure is in the sunward\ndirection. The plasma that fills the figure is a two\ncomponent neutral fluid that is bounded by magnetic\nfield lines that are up on the right side and down on\nthe left side of the figure, and for which, in each case,\nthere is an electric field, Eo , out of the plane of the\nfigure. Thus, the plasma on both sides of the figure\nEo \u00d7 B/B 2 drifts towards the center of the figure.\nThe two oppositely directed magnetic fields may be\nunequal in magnitude or a magnetic field component,\ncalled the guide field, may exist out of the plane of\nFig. 1. These features add complexity to the geometry without significantly modifying the basic physical\nprocesses that occur inside a few ion skin depths, so\nthe guide field is assumed to be zero and the oppositely directed magnetic fields are assumed to be\nequal in magnitude. Fig. 1 describes the boundary\nconditions for the processes that occur in the central\nregion of the figure and that will be deduced in the\nfollowing discussion.\nThe physics of reconnection depends on the electric field component out of the plane of Fig. 1 at the\n\nAbstract. The underlying concepts of collisionless magnetic field reconnection in the vicinity of the diffusion\nregions are developed qualitatively from first principles.\nOne conclusion of this analysis is that energetic ions and\nelectrons observed in the terrestrial magnetosphere or\nfrom the sun are not accelerated to the observed energies\nin the diffusion regions.\n\nIn plasmas from the laboratory to the terrestrial\nmagnetosphere, the sun, and accretion disks in astrophysics, it is observed that magnetic field geometries\nchange and particles are accelerated on time scales\nthat are short compared to magnetic field diffusion\ntimes due to classical Coulomb collisions. These observations require physical processes different from\nCoulomb resistivity. One such process is collisionless magnetic field reconnection, which is discussed in\nthis paper by defining boundary conditions in a region of space and applying first principles inside these\nboundaries to qualitatively deduce the plasma flow,\nenergy flow and the fields associated with reconnection. The goals of this approach are to remove some\nof the mystery and confusion that may surround field\nline motion and magnetic field reconnection.\nMagnetic field reconnection is defined as the process that occurs when magnetized plasmas with different magnetic field orientations flow together to alter the connectivity of the magnetic field lines. It\noccurs on spatial scales of the electron and ion skin\ndepths (c/\u03c9pe and c/\u03c9pi , where \u03c9pe and \u03c9pi are the\nion and electron plasma frequencies, respectively),\n1\n\n\fof electromagnetic energy into particle energy, which\nis what magnetic field reconnection is all about.\nWhere does the energy associated with this\npositive j*E originate? To answer this question, an\nanalogy will be made with the electric circuit of Fig.\n2, consisting of a battery and a resistor. From freshman physics, the electromagnetic energy conversion\nrate is VI where V is the battery voltage and I is the\ncurrent. A second method for computing the energy\nconversion is to integrate j*E over the resistor volume.\nWith j integrated over \u03c0r2 , the cross-sectional area of\nthe resistor, to give I and E integrated over the length\nof the resistor to become the potential drop V, the\nenergy conversion rate is again VI. A third method is\nto consider the integral of the Poynting flux through\nthe surface that surrounds the resistor. Because E\nis everywhere parallel to the axis of the cylinder and\nB everywhere circles the resistor, the Poynting flux,\nE \u00d7 B/\u03bco , is everywhere inward and its integrated\nmagnitude is Eh(2\u03c0rB)/\u03bco ). Because Eh = V and\n2\u03c0rB/\u03bco = I, the result is again VI. A fourth way\nto compute the power dissipation is to utilize a later\nproof in this paper to say that magnetic field lines\ncarry energy density B 2 /\u03bco into the resistor at the\nEo \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity, where the magnetic field is annihilated. This field line motion inserts (B 2 /\u03bco )(E/B)\nor EB/\u03bco units of energy per unit area per second,\nwhich is the same power input as given by the Poynting flux, so the answer is again VI.\nIf the EMF (in the case of Fig. 2, a battery) is\nconstant, the energy conversion rate is constant.\nThis is analogous to the case of steady state reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, where the\nenergy is continuously supplied by the solar wind as\nit slows down. In both cases, the partial derivatives\nof all fields with respect to time are zero, so it is\nconfusing to think of this process as magnetic field\nannihilation. This is just one example of problems\narising from misinterpretation of the concept of\nmoving magnetic field lines.\n\nFigure 1\n\ncenter of the figure, which is sometimes called the\ntangential electric field. If it is zero, the two plasmas\nflow around each other into or out of the plane of\nthe figure because there is no Eo \u00d7 B/B 2 flow in the\nplane of the figure in this central region. This would\nbe the case for a closed terrestrial magnetosphere\nin which the solar wind plasma flows around the\nobstacle much as water flows around a rock in a\nstream. On the other hand, if the tangential electric\nfield is non-zero, the plasmas continue flowing towards each other into the central region of the figure\nand magnetic field reconnection occurs as discussed\nbelow. The main effort in theoretical reconnection\nresearch has been the search for a large value of the\ntangential electric field in the central region (Parker,\n1957, 1963; Sonnerup et al., 1984; Birn et al., 2001;\nShay et al., 2001). Because this research is beyond\nthe scope of this article, it is assumed that the\ntangential electric field in the central region is equal\nto Eo .\n\nWhy is there so much theoretical interest\nin making Eo large? Consider the current out\nof the plane in the central region of Fig. 1, which\nWhere does the converted electromagnetic\nis required by the curl of the magnetic field. A energy go? It may generate waves or heat and/or\nnon-zero electric field results in a positive value of accelerate the plasma. Assuming that all the availj * E in the central region of the figure and conversion able energy goes into particle acceleration, the par2\n\n\fbecause of the mass ratio so electrons are much\nless accelerated than ions in the diffusion region.\n\u2022 Although the energies of particles leaving the\ndiffusion region are less than those observed in\nspace, such particles may be accelerated further after leaving the diffusion regions by utilizing the particle energy resulting from reconnection (Birn and Hesse, 2005) or by using additional energy sources and mechanisms, such as\nare available by surfing on plasma waves, particles following meandering orbits, etc.\nWhat happens to the plasma that is accelerated by the electromagnetic energy\nconversion? It must leave the central region by either flowing up/down or into/out of the plane of Fig.\n1. A convenient simplification results from assuming\nthat reconnection is a two-dimensional process, from\nwhich it follows that the plasma exits the central\nregion of Fig. 1 in the vertical direction. It is not\nnecessary that the geometry be two-dimensional\nand in the real world it isn't (Mozer et al., 2003b),\nalthough the current, j, flowing out of the plane of\nFig. 1 suggests a tendency for a two-dimensional\ngeometry. To keep the geometry simple without\nlosing any physics, it is assumed in this discussion\nthat the plasma exits the central region by flowing\nvertically. This leads to bulk plasma flows like those\nindicated by the heavy lines in Fig. 3.\n\nFigure 2\n\nticle energization is computed in a static model of a\nsingle ion species as follows. Consider a closed surface that extends between the two magnetic field lines\nof Fig. 1 and that has a length, h, along the field\nlines and width, w, out of the figure. There is a\nnet Poynting flux, 2whEo B/\u03bco , through this surface\nfrom the right and the left. The number of particles that move into this volume per second at the\nEo \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity is 2whnEo /B, where n is the\nplasma density. Thus, the energy gained per particle is (2whEo B/\u03bco )/(2whnEo /B) = B 2 /n\u03bco , and\nthe average velocity increase of a low energy ion is\nv = [2B 2 /mn\u03bco ]1/2 , where m is the ion mass. Thus,\nwithin a factor \u223c1, the bulk flow of low energy ions\nincreases at most to the Alfven speed in the diffuWhat is the magnetic field geometry assosion region after reconnection. This has many conse- ciated with the flows of Fig. 3?

Utilize a method of visualizing the magnetic\nfield geometry without having to solve Maxwell's\n\u2022 The electron bulk speed is also increased at most\nequations. One such method is to assume that\nto the ion Alfven speed to maintain neutrality in\nthe magnetic field evolves in time by magnetic\nthe absence of an outgoing current. However, the\nfield lines moving at the E \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity.\nelectron energy is about 1/1856 of the ion energy\n3\n\n\fFigure 4\nevolves as is required by Maxwell's equations if magnetic field lines move with the E \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity. It\nis noted that any velocity v\u2032 satisfying \u2207 * (Bv\u2032 ) = 0\nmay be added to E \u00d7 B/B 2 without modifying equation 1. Thus, there are an infinite number of magnetic\nfield line velocities that preserve the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field.\nThe direction of a field line moving with E \u00d7\nB/B 2 must also be the same as that obtained from\nMaxwell's equations. To find the condition under\nwhich this is true, consider two surfaces, S1 and S2 in\nFig. 4, that are perpendicular to the field at times t\nand t + \u03b4t. At time t, a magnetic field line intersects\nthe two surfaces at points a and b. Thus, the vector\n(b \u2212 a) is parallel to B(t). At the later time, t + \u03b4t,\npoint a has moved along S1 at velocity E \u00d7 B/B 2 (a)\nto point a\u2032 and it is on the illustrated magnetic field\nline. Meanwhile, point b has moved along S2 to b\u2032 at\nvelocity E \u00d7 B/B 2 (b) and it may or may not be on\nthe field line that passes through a\u2032 . The question is,\nwhat is the constraint on these motions that result in\na\u2032 and b\u2032 being on the same magnetic field line, i.e.,\nthat result in (b\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 ) being parallel to B(t + \u03b4t)?\nTo find the constraint, we start with the identity\n(b\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 ) = (b \u2212 a) + (b\u2032 \u2212 b) \u2212 (a\u2032 \u2212 a). The terms\non the right side of this equation are:\n\nFigure 3\nMethod 2 is preferable to method 1 as long as\nmethod 2 gives the same solution as method 1. If\nit does not, there is nothing magic about the situation. It is just that Maxwell's equations must be\nsolved in order to determine the magnetic field.\nIn the following discussion, a condition is found\nfor which the magnetic field geometry obtained by\nassuming that field lines move with E \u00d7 B/B 2 is\nthe same as that produced by Maxwell's equations\n(Longmire, 1963). The concept of moving magnetic\nfield lines implies that field lines do not just pop up\nin a region of increasing field strength, but that field\nlines flow into that region. Because magnetic field\nlines are conserved in this picture, they obey a continuity equation which, in a coordinate system with\nthe local magnetic field in the Z-direction, is\n\u2202BZ /\u2202t + \u2207 * (Bv) = 0\n\n(1)\n\nSelecting the field line velocity to be v = E \u00d7\nB/B 2 , the components of Bv are (Bv)X = EY and\n(Bv)Y = \u2212EX , so equation 1 becomes\n\u2202BZ /\u2202t + \u2202EY /\u2202x \u2212 \u2202EX /\u2202y = 0\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is the z-component of Faraday's law. Thus,\nwithout approximation and in the presence or absence of plasma, the magnitude of the magnetic field\n4\n\n(b \u2212 a) =\n(a\u2032 \u2212 a) =\n\n\u03b5B, because (b \u2212 a) is parallel to B.\n[E \u00d7 B/B 2 (a)]\u03b4t\n\n(b\u2032 \u2212 b) =\n=\n\n[E \u00d7 B/B 2 (b)]\u03b4t\n[E \u00d7 B/B 2 (a) +\n\n\f(b \u2212 a) \u2202(E \u00d7 B/B 2 (a)/\u2202r)]\u03b4t\n=\n\nThe existence and/or properties of plasma did not\nenter into the equation 7 requirement that field line\nmotion at E \u00d7 B/B 2 produces the same result as\nMaxwell's equations. Thus, field line motion does\nnot require the presence of plasma, contrary to what\nsome discussions of field line motion assume.\nA vacuum example in which field line motion does\nnot produce the same result as Maxwell's equations\noccurs for a magnetic dipole placed in a uniform electric field, with the dipole axis parallel to the electric\nfield direction (Falthammer, 2005). The E \u00d7 B/B 2\ndirection of a magnetic field line in the northern hemisphere is opposite to that on the same field line in the\nsouthern hemisphere, so the magnetic field lines appear to twist. This result disagrees with Maxwell's\nequations for a dipole magnetic field, so something\nis wrong. In fact, B \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 Ek ) 6= 0 everywhere,\nso the magnetic field evolution cannot be obtained\nby assuming that magnetic field lines move with the\nE \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity. There is nothing mysterious\nabout this problem. It is just that the magnetic field\nmust be obtained from Maxwell's equations and not\nfrom moving field lines.\nIn the assumed absence of a parallel electric field\nin Fig. 3, the magnetic field evolution can be determined by moving a pair of magnetic field lines with\nthe E \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity. This produces the magnetic\nfield geometry of Fig. 5, which may be thought of\nas a superposition of snapshots at times t1, * * * , t5\nof two magnetic field lines that E \u00d7 B/B 2 towards\neach other. There is the obvious problem that the\nmagnetic field lines in the center of the plot have\npassed over each other to produce points having the\nmagnetic field in two directions. This violation of\nMaxwell's equations means that there must be a parallel electric field in the central region such that the\nmagnetic field evolution in this region cannot be obtained by any means other than solving Maxwell's\nequations. There is nothing magic about the central\nregion, but only that one cannot obtain the magnetic\nfield geometry in this region by moving magnetic field\nlines.\nEliminating the magnetic field lines in the region\nhaving a parallel electric field leaves the geometry of\nFig. 6. The reader is reminded that Fig. 6 shows the\nion diffusion region while the interior of the dashed\n\n2\n\n[E \u00d7 B/B (a) +\n\u03b5B * \u2207(E \u00d7 B/B 2 (a))]\u03b4t\n\nwhere r is along the magnetic field line at time t.\nCombining terms gives\n(b\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 )/\u03b5 = B + B * \u2207(E \u00d7 B/B 2 )\u03b4t\n\n(3)\n\nAlso\nB\u2032\n\n=\n\nB (a, t + \u03b4t)\n\n=\n\nB + (\u2202B/\u2202t) \u03b4t +\n(E \u00d7 B/B 2 ) * \u2207)B\u03b4t\n\n(4)\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the constraints that\nare imposed by the requirement that the right sides\nof equations 3 and 4 have a zero cross-product. To\nfirst order in \u03b4t, this gives\nB \u00d7 [\u2202B/\u2202t + (E \u00d7 B/B 2 ) * \u2207)B \u2212\nB * \u2207(E \u00d7 B/B 2 )] =\n\n0 (5)\n\nUsing the vector identity for \u2207 \u00d7 M \u00d7 N, for any two\nvectors M and N, allows rewriting equation 5 as\nB \u00d7 {\u2202B/\u2202t + \u2207 \u00d7 (B \u00d7 (E \u00d7 B/B 2 )) +\nB(\u2207 * (E \u00d7 B/B 2 ) \u2212 (E \u00d7 B/B 2 )\u2207 * B} = 0\n\n(6)\n\nThe last term on the right is zero because \u2207 * B = 0\nand the next to last term may be neglected because\nits cross product with B is zero. Because B \u00d7 (E \u00d7\nB/B 2 ) = E \u2212 Ek and \u2202B/\u2202t = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 E, equation 6\nis\nB \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 Ek ) = 0\n\n(7)\n\nThis is the constraint that makes the direction of the\nmagnetic field during its E \u00d7 B/B 2 motion the same\nas that found from Maxwell's equations. This condition is sometimes loosely stated as the requirement\nthat the parallel electric field must be zero for field\nlines to move at the E \u00d7 B/B 2 velocity.\n5\n\n\fFigure 6\n\nFigure 5\nbox will be shown to contain one or more electron\ndiffusion regions.\nFrom the geometry of Fig. 6, magnetic field lines\nto the right of the figure in the input flow region have\nbecome connected in the outflow region to magnetic\nfield lines that were in the left input flow region. This\nis the change of magnetic field connectivity that is\nrequired by the earlier definition of magnetic field\nreconnection.\nThe only use of the concept of moving magnetic\nfield lines in the above discussion has been to aid\nin determining the magnetic field configuration. If\nmore than this use is made of moving field lines, there\nis a risk of drawing erroneous conclusions such as,\nbecause the magnetic field lines move in Fig. 6, \u2202B/\u2202t\nis non-zero. This is incorrect.\nThe change of magnetic field connectivity in terrestrial reconnection is illustrated in Fig. 7. This figure shows three differently connected regimes, type 1\nwhich contains magnetic field lines that go through\nthe sun without going through the earth, type 2\nwhich go through the earth without going through\nthe sun and type 3 which go through both the earth\nand the sun. These topological boundaries are shown\nas the dashed X-line in Fig. 8.\nThe discussion thus far has left many unanswered\nquestions. For example:\n\nFigure 7\n\nFigure 8\n\n6\n\n\f\u2022 How do the ions and electrons move to\ncreate the current, j?\n\n\u2022 Ignoring me /mi terms\ngives the Generalized Ohm's Law\n\n\u2022 How are the ions accelerated to the Alfven\nspeed?\n\nE + Ui \u00d7 B = j \u00d7 B/en \u2212 \u2207 * Pe /en +\n\n\u2022 How is the parallel electric field in the central region generated?\n\n(me /ne2 )\u2202j/\u2202t + \u03b7j\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the Coulomb or anomalous resistivity.\nThese questions will be discussed qualitatively Equivalently, because j/ne = U \u2212 U ,\ni\ne\nthrough application of the Generalized Ohm's Law\nas derived from the two-fluid equations of motion,\nwhich are (Spitzer, 1956):\nE+Ue \u00d7B = \u2212\u2207*Pe /en+(me /ne2 )\u2202j/\u2202t+\u03b7j (11)\nFor the current to be non-zero, the ions and electrons must move differently, i.e., the left side of equation 10 and/or 11 must be non-zero. Because the\nj\u00d7B force of equation 10 acts on ions and because the\nion inertial length, c/\u03c9pi , and the ion gyroradius are\nmuch larger than the electron inertial length, c/\u03c9pe ,\nand the electron gyroradius, the ion bulk motion deviates from E \u00d7 B/B 2 on the larger spatial scale,\ncalled the ion diffusion region. Meanwhile, the electron motion must include E \u00d7 B/B 2 flow perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 8 and into the figure because\nelectrons provide the major part of the out-of-plane\ncurrent. This requires an in-plane electric field, En ,\nperpendicular to the magnetic field and pointing towards the center of Fig. 8 from both sides in the ion\ndiffusion region.\nIons entering from the left or right move predominantly within the plane to be accelerated by En and\nthe j \u00d7 B force to the opposite side of the central region where they decelerate, turn around, and again\naccelerate. They bounce between the two sides to\neventually exit vertically at the Alfven speed. Because enEn \u2248 jB according to equation 10, and because the sum of the two forces times c/\u03c9pi is about\nthe energy B 2 /\u03bco gained by a unit volume of fluid,\nthe electric field is deduced as En \u2248 valf ven B/2. This\nis \u223c20 mV/m at the sub-solar magnetopause, which\nis much larger than the fraction of a mV/m reconnection field, Eo , observed in space and in simulations. En and the ion counter-streaming and acceleration have been observed in space (Mozer et al., 2002;\nWygant, 2005). It is also noted that the ions are accelerated in a region having the ion scale and not\n\nFor ions\nni mi [\u2202Ui /\u2202t + (Ui * \u2207)Ui ] =\nni Ze(E + Ui \u00d7 B) \u2212 \u2207 * Pi + Pie\n\n(8)\n\nFor electrons\nne me [\u2202Ue /\u2202t + (Ue * \u2207)Ue ] =\n\u2212ne e(E + Ue \u00d7 B) \u2212 \u2207 * Pe + Pei\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n\u2022 Ui and Ue are the ion and electron velocities\naveraged over unit volumes\n\u2022 ni and mi are the ion density and mass, respectively\n\u2022 ne and me are the electron density and mass,\nrespectively\n\u2022 Pi and Pe are the ion and electron pressure tensors\n\u2022 Pie and Pei are the momentum transferred to\nions (electrons) from electrons (ions) per unit\nvolume per unit time.\nSubtraction of (9) from (8) assuming:\n\u2022 Neglect of quadratic terms\n\u2022 Electrical neutrality (which means that the electron and ion densities are equal everywhere except in Maxwell's equation for the divergence of\nthe electric field)\n7\n\n\fin the much smaller electron diffusion region that is\ndiscussed below.\nThe electric field, En , existing along the dashed X\nin Fig. 8 over a scale size of c/\u03c9pi , has a non-zero\ndivergence so it must result from charge separation.\nThis requires that electrons move along the magnetic\nfield lines in the plane of Fig. 8 and into the dashed\nbox to create the charge separation. The parallel (to\nB) in-plane electric field in the dashed box accelerates\nthese electrons to the outgoing ion bulk velocity, after\nwhich they are ejected into the upper and lower central regions. This in-plane electron current causes the\nout-of-plane quadrupolar magnetic field that is illustrated in Fig. 8 and that has been observed in space\n(Mozer et al., 2002) and in the lab (Ren et al., 2005).\nThe j \u00d7 B/en term in equation 10, the quadrupolar\nmagnetic field, and the bipolar electric field constitute the essence of Hall MHD physics.\nFig. 9 shows a sub-solar magnetopause crossing by\nthe Polar satellite in which the Hall MHD terms are\nquantitatively present. Panel (d) gives the reconnection magnetic field which changes from \u221280 nT in\nthe magnetosheath to +80 nT in the magnetosphere.\nPanel (c) gives the out-of-plane magnetic field component which shows both a small guide field and the\nquadrupolar magnetic field. Panel (e) gives the bipolar normal electric field. It is noted that the tangential electric field of panel (f) is positive which means\nthat magnetic field lines and plasma were flowing toward the center of the magnetopause from each side.\nIt is also noted that the bipolar electric field is an\norder-of-magnitude larger than the tangential electric field.\nIt is important to note that less than 1% of\nsatellite sub-solar magnetopause crossings exhibit\nclear signatures of the quadrupolar magnetic field\nand bipolar electric field of Fig. 8 (Mozer et al.,\n2002). This is undoubtedly due to time variations, real geometries that differ from the idealized\ntwo-dimensional geometry of equal and opposite\nmagnetic fields, spacecraft crossings at distances far\nfrom the center of the reconnection region, etc.\n\nFigure 9\n\ngion because of the parallel electric field on the left\nside. Thus, the parallel electric field must be associated with either the time derivative of j (inertial\neffects), the divergence of the pressure tensor, or finite resistivity. Experimental data suggests that it\nis associated with the pressure tensor (Mozer et al.,\n2002; Mozer, 2005a), but this is an important issue\nthat remains to be fully resolved.\nIt is noted that the parallel electric field cannot\nbe balanced by an isotropic pressure gradient. This\nis because \u2207 \u00d7 Ek is non-zero and the isotropic pressure gradient that would balance Ek has a curl that is\nzero (because the curl of the gradient of any scalar is\nzero). Thus, off-diagonal terms in the pressure tensor\nare required for the pressure term to balance the parallel electric field. Consideration of these off-diagonal\nterms requires a kinetic theory that is beyond the\nscope of the present discussion.\nAn example of an electron diffusion region observed\nin the sub-solar magnetopause is given in the four\nsecond plot of Fig. 10. Panel (b) gives the reconnecting component of the magnetic field which changed\nin steps as the spacecraft passed from the magneWhat is the nature of the parallel electric tosheath to the magnetosphere.

In the largest current filament, the plasma\n8\n\n\fFigure 11\ncal conclusions should not be obtained from cartoons,\nit is important to consider that the dashed box may\ncontain a large number of electron scale structures,\neach of which is located where the magnetic field is\nnon-zero and each of which contains a parallel electric\nfield. This possibility is strongly supported by theoretical ideas (Tajima and Shibata, 2002), computer\nsimulations (Onofri et al., 2004; Daughton, 2006)\nand experimental data (Mozer et al., 2003a; Mozer,\n2005a; Mozer et al., 2005b). The locations of 117\nelectron diffusion regions found in the sub-solar magnetopause in searching three years of Polar data are\nshown in Fig. 11. The sub-solar point is at the center\nof the plot which spans a local time of eight hours\nand a latitude of \u00b140 degrees. This data suggests\nthat electron diffusion regions occur frequently and\nat all locations within the magnetopause.\nThe reconnection rate is proportional to the\nnumber of magnetic field lines crossing into the reconnection region per unit area per second. Because\nthe density of field lines is B and their velocity\nis Eo \u00d7 B/B 2 , the rate of field line entry is the\ndensity times the velocity, or Eo . This is why the\ntangential electric field is sometimes referred to as\nthe reconnection rate.\n\nFigure 10\n\ndensity of panel (a) decreased by a factor of two\nwhile there was a large, electric field with a duration\nof about 0.075 seconds, as illustrated in the bottom\nthree panels. This structure had a spatial dimension\nof \u223c c/\u03c9pe . Panel (e) shows that the parallel electric\nfield in this electron diffusion region had a magnitude\nof \u223c7 mV/m. It is also noted that the magnetic field\nstrength at the time of the event was \u223c60 nT and the\nelectron beta was much less than one.\nAs suggested by the steady state nature of the\nfields in the ion diffusion region, it is plausible that\nthe inertial terms of equation 11 are small in this\nregion. However, in the dashed box of Fig. 8, they\nare probably important because a non-zero \u2207\u00d7Ek requires non-zero terms in \u2207\u00d7E and a non-zero \u2202B/\u2202t,\nunless other terms in \u2207 \u00d7 E exactly cancel the nonzero terms, which is unlikely.\nThe scale size for which the terms on the right\nside of equation 11 become important is \u223c c/\u03c9pe\n(Vasyliunas, 1975). A single region of this size is frequently drawn at the crossing of the dashed X in Fig.\n8 to represent the electron diffusion region in which\nWhat does sub-solar reconnection do for\nelectrons are demagnetized. From such a cartoon,\nit is sometimes incorrectly concluded that the mag- magnetospheric physics? Because most of the acnetic field must be zero and the plasma beta must be celerated plasma escapes into the solar wind, it may\nlarge in the electron diffusion region. Because physi- appear that dayside reconnection is not important.\n9\n\n\fThis conclusion is incorrect because reconnection also\nmodifies the magnetic field connectivity to produce a\nlong tail in the anti-sunward direction, as illustrated\nin Fig. 7. In the southern hemisphere tail, the magnetic field points away from the earth and in the\nnorthern hemisphere tail, it points earthward. In the\npresence of a dawn-to-dusk electric field, the Poynting vector along the tail surface is everywhere inward,\nso its integral over this closed surface provides an energy source for driving magnetospheric processes. For\na tail that is 300 earth radii long and 30 earth radii\nin diameter, the energy input associated with a magnetic field of 10 nT and a cross-tail electric field of\n0.5 mV/m is \u223c 2 \u00d7 1012 watts. This is more than sufficient to drive all known magnetospheric processes\nand it is more than four orders-of-magnitude larger\nthan the energy directly available from sub-solar reconnection. The EMF that provides this energy is\nthe kinetic energy of the solar wind, which slows as\nit moves along the tail.\nFor the sub-solar region, it may seem that the reconnection rate need only be large enough to produce\nthe long tail. However, a large Poynting flux into the\ntail implies a large E \u00d7 B/B 2 flow of magnetic field\nlines into the tail and these field lines must also reconnect. Because the average reconnection on the\ndayside and in the tail must be equal, a large Poynting flux into the tail must be accompanied by a large\nsub-solar reconnection rate.\nIn summary, topics for future research on magnetic\nfield reconnection include:\n\n\u2022 The importance of electron diffusion regions\nthat are observed throughout the magnetopause\nas well as in the magnetosphere, the magnetosheath, and the bow shock (Mozer et al.,\n2006).\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks C.-G.
