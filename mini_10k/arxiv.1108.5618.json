Numerically solving Einstein's equations is\nnow quite routine [3\u20139], yet still computationally burdensome. Reference [10] suggests that there is a finite\ndensity of numerical simulations that would adequately\ncover the parameter space for certain ground-based detectors. In this work we explore this concept and extend\nthe numerical techniques presented in [11] and [12], to\ninterpolation of template waveforms using the singular\nvalue decomposition. This should allow for the construction of gravitational waveforms with parameters between\nthe numerically generated waveforms.\nThe idea of interpolating gravitational waveforms has\nexisted for over a decade. Interpolation of waveforms\ngenerated by post-Newtonian techniques was described\nin [13] and [14]. In these references analytic formulae for\nwaveform interpolation were derived for particular PN\nmodels. Since 2005 the numerical relativity community\nhas been generating a substantial number of gravitational\nwaveforms for the coalescence of binary black holes [3\u20139].\nInterpolation of these waveforms has been accomplished\nprimarily by (i) phenomenologically fitting the simulations to closed-form expressions [15\u201317] or (ii) by numerically solving simpler differential equations that capture\nthe orbital dynamics combined with numerical stitching\nof the ringdown phase [18\u201323]. In this work we propose a\ndifferent approach to interpolate a set of template waveforms. This approach does not require careful tuning\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nkipp.cannon@ligo.org\nchad.hanna@ligo.org\ndrew.keppel@ligo.org\n\nof fitting formulae or stitching of waveforms and can be\napplied to any waveform set of sufficient density.\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, we describe\nthe technique for interpolating waveforms via the singular value decomposition. Second we apply the technique\nto a set of waveforms containing all phases of the compact\nbinary coalescence, inspiral, merger and ringdown. Third\nwe discuss how these results might be applied to the contruction of waveform families, ongoing gravitational wave\nsearches, and parameter estimation.\n\nII.\n\nINTERPOLATION TECHNIQUE\n\nIt was shown in [11] that the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) reduces the number of template\nwaveforms needed to search a given parameter space. Additionally, [12] showed that arbitrary waveforms within\nthe parameter space could be reconstructed from the\nSVD of a sufficiently dense template bank. Here we\ndemonstrate a method to directly obtain approximate\nreconstruction coefficients for arbitrary waveforms in the\nparameter space via interpolation. Consider a waveform family h(x, y) described by the physical parameters\n(x, y), and consider a set of these waveforms enumerated\nby the index \u03b1 drawn from a region of the parameter\nspace, h(x\u03b1 , y\u03b1 ). Recall that a SVD of these waveforms\nallows each to be written as a linear combination of basis\nwaveforms u\u03bc with coefficients M\u03bc (x\u03b1 , y\u03b1 )\nh(x\u03b1 , y\u03b1 ) =\n\nX\n\nM\u03bc (x\u03b1 , y\u03b1 ) u\u03bc ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere, in the formalism of [11] and [12], M\u03bc (x\u03b1 , y\u03b1 ) :=\n\u03c3\u03bc (v(2\u03b1\u22121)\u03bc + iv(2\u03b1)\u03bc ) is the \u03b1th combination of singular values \u03c3\u03bc and reconstruction coefficients v(2\u03b1\u22121)\u03bc and\nv(2\u03b1)\u03bc . Recall also that waveforms with arbitrary physical parameters from the same region of parameter space\ncan also be reconstructed using the basis vectors u\u03bc by\n\n\f2\nprojecting the waveforms onto the basis vectors to obtain the reconstruction coefficients-a computationally\nexpensive procedure,\nX\nh(x, y) \u2248\n(h(x, y) * u\u03bc ) u\u03bc .\n(2)\n\u03bc\n\nThis can be used to define the arbitrary reconstruction\ncoefficients as\nM\u03bc (x, y) = h(x, y) * u\u03bc .\n\nwhere j ranges from 0 to Jmax . This choice of net reduces Runge's phenomenon when used with the Chebyshev polynomials, which, for a single dimension, are given\nas\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(x \u2212 x2 \u2212 1)J + (x + x2 \u2212 1)J\nTJ (x) =\n,\n(5)\n2w\np\nwhere w = (1 + \u03b4J0 )(Jmax + 1)/2 is a normalization\nfactor for the polynomials and \u03b4J0 is the Kroenecker\ndelta. Both xj and w depend on the choice of Jmax ,\nhowever for ease of notation we will leave this implied.\nThe polynomials TJ (x) satisfy the discrete orthogonality\ncondition\nTI (xj )TJ (xj ) = \u03b4IJ .\n\nCKL\u03bc =\n\n(6)\n\nj=0\n\nIt is straightforward to extend this to higher dimensions.\nIn order to obtain the reconstruction coefficients for\nthese locations, we project waveforms from these locations onto the basis vectors. From the values on this\nnet, we interpolate to other positions in parameter space\nusing 2D-Chebyshev interpolation for each set of reconstruction coefficients M\u03bc (x, y). Specifically, these values\n\nK\nmax\nmax L\nX\nX\nk=0\n\nTK (xk )TL (yl )M\u03bc (xk , yl ).\n\n(7)\n\nl=0\n\nThis results in coefficients for the 2D-Chebyshev polynomials which can be used to evaluate the interpolated\nreconstruction coefficients M\u03bc0 (x, y) at other points in parameter space\n\n(3)\n\nWe seek the set of interpolated reconstruction coefficients\nM\u03bc0 (x, y) that can approximately reconstruct an arbitrary waveform from that region of parameter space.\nCompact binary gravitational waveforms with negligible effects from spin and eccentricity are characterized by\ntheir component masses. We will assume for concreteness\na two parameter family of waveforms h(x, y) where x and\ny are M and q, respectively, where M = m1 + m2 is the\ntotal mass of the system and q = m1 /m2 is the mass\nratio of the system.\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind are known to\nbe good for interpolation, however other interpolation\nschemes are also possible. We start with a set of basis\nvectors uj covering the desired region of parameter space.\nWe choose a net of points, scaled such that each dimension covers the interval [\u22121, 1], located at the Jmax th\norder Chebyshev nodes. For a single dimension, these\nnodes occur at the locations\n\u0013\n\u0012\nj + 12\n,\n(4)\nxj = cos \u03c0\nJmax + 1\n\nJX\nmax\n\nare projected onto the Chebyshev polynomials\n\nM\u03bc0 (x, y) =\n\nK\nmax L\nmax\nX\nX\n\nCKL\u03bc TK (x)TL (y).\n\n(8)\n\nK=0 L=0\n\nIn the next section we explore this approximation technique using gravitational waveforms containing all three\nphases of binary coalescence, inspiral, merger and ringdown.\nA.\n\nReconstruction Errors\n\nErrors in reconstructing these waveforms come in two\ntypes: errors due to SVD truncation, and errors due to\nreconstruction coefficient interpolation. The truncation\nerrors have previously been shown to take the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\n\u03b4\u03c1(x, y)\n1 X\n=\n|M\u03bc (x, y)|2 ,\n(9)\n\u03c1(x, y) trunc\n4\n0\n\u03bc=N +1\n\nwhere the sum is over the basis vectors that are discarded.\nThe interpolation errors have a similar form\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(x, y)\n\u03c1(x, y)\n\n\u0013\ninterp\n\nN\n1X\n=\n|M\u03bc (x, y) \u2212 M\u03bc0 (x, y)|2 . (10)\n4 \u03bc=1\n\nIt should be noted that here the sum is over the basis\nvectors that are kept from the SVD. By setting the reconstruction coefficients with \u03bc > N 0 to zero, these can\nbe combined into a single expression\nN\n\u03b4\u03c1(x, y)\n1X\n=\n|M\u03bc (x, y) \u2212 M\u03bc0 (x, y)|2 .\n\u03c1(x, y)\n4 \u03bc=1\n\nIII.\n\n(11)\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe apply this procedure in two ways. In section III A\nwe investigate using this approach in the context of interpolating whitened waveforms. This would be useful in\nthe context of parameter estimation. Specifically, one\ncould obtain reconstruction coefficients that would be\nused for constructing filter outputs associated with arbitrary points in parameter space using the filter outputs\nfrom the SVD basis vectors.\nIn section III B, we apply similar techniques to interpolate raw waveforms. This is done in the context of waveforms one would receive from numerical relativity simulations (i.e., time series of \u03a82 (t) = \u2202t2 h+ (t) + i\u2202t2 h\u00d7 (t)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1. Reconstruction coefficients as a function of M and q\nassociated with the 3rd and 21st basis vectors are shown in the\nleft and right columns, respectively. The top row shows the\nreal part of the reconstruction coefficients. The bottom row\nshows the imaginary part of the reconstruction coefficients.\n\nthat are restricted to lie along lines of constant M ). This\napproach could be taken to extend numerical relativity\nwaveform catalogs at greatly reduced computational cost.\n\nA.\n\nWhitened waveforms\n\nWe apply this procedure to non-spinning phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveforms [17]\nwith M \u2208 [60M , 80M ], q \u2208 [1, 10], whitened with\nan initial LIGO amplitude spectral density (ASD), and\ntransformed to the time domain. We generate a stochastic template bank [24] with 99% minimal match for this\nrange of parameters. Since we are working with IMR\nwaveforms, there is no well defined end of the waveform.\nWe choose to align the whitened waveforms according to\ntheir peak amplitudes and compute the SVD basis vectors from these waveforms using the procedure described\nin [11]. At this intermediate stage, if we were to look at\nhow the resulting reconstruction coefficients vary in parameter space, we would see high frequency features that\nwould be difficult to resolve with interpolation without a\nhigh density interpolation net.\nFortunately, these features can be ameliorated by a\ncomplex rotation of the input waveforms, which is equivalent to a complex rotation of the reconstruction coefficients,\nM\u03bc (x, y) \u2192 e\u2212i arg M1 (x,y) M\u03bc (x, y).\n\n(12)\n\nThis rotation is chosen such that = [M1 (x, y)] = 0. Fig. 1\nshows the reconstruction coefficients associated with the\n\nFIG. 2. The upper panel shows the fitting factor residual\nassociated with using the interpolation net as templates in\na template bank. The lower panel shows the interpolation\nmismatch for waveforms from with the parameter space. The\ninterpolation mismatch is more than an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the fitting factor residual.\n\n3rd and 21st basis vectors after this complex rotation.\nThe smoothness of these reconstruction coefficients indicates that interpolation should be possible.\nIn order to perform the interpolation, waveforms from\nthe (12,12) order 2D-Chebyshev net are then projected\nonto these basis vectors to obtain the interpolation coefficients, as described by (7), and rotated as described\nabove. 40 \u00d7 40 test waveforms from within the parameter space, laid out in a grid, are used for computing\nmismatches between the interpolated waveforms, given\nby (8), and the original waveforms. Fig. 2 compares the\nfitting factor residual, which we define to be one minus\nthe fitting factor, obtained from using the net waveforms\nas templates with the interpolation mismatches associated with the test waveforms. We see that the largest\ninterpolation mismatch is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the fitting factor residual from the net\nwaveforms.\n\nB.\n\nRaw waveforms\n\nWe apply similar techniques to waveforms of a type\nthat would be provided by numerical relativity simulations. Specifically, we use non-spinning phenomenological IMR waveforms [17] with M \u2208 [60M , 80M ],\nq \u2208 [1, 6], multiplied by f 2 , which is equivalent to taking two time-derivatives, and transformed to the time\ndomain. We use the same alignment and rotation techniques described in section III A to prepare the waveforms for interpolation.\n\n\f4\nbitrary points in parameter space by interpolating reconstruction coefficients from the SVD of a set of waveforms\nuniformly covering the space.\n\nFIG. 3. The upper panel shows the locations for which waveforms were produced, chosen by a stochastic template placement algorithm. These waveforms were used in constructing\nthe basis vectors enclosing this region of parameter space. The\nlower panel shows the interpolation mismatch for waveforms\nfrom within the parameter space. Waveforms interpolation\naccuracies are below a few times 10\u22124 .\n\nTo generate the basis vectors that enclose this parameter space, we construct a stochastic template bank\nwith an additional constraint. The mass ratios of the\ntemplates are restricted to take on values q \u2208 {qj =\n5xj + 1|j \u2208 [1, 6]}, where xj are the nodes associated\nwith the 10th order Chebyshev polynomial.\nWith the basis vectors in hand, we project the waveforms from an interpolation net consisting of the (20,10)\n2D-Chebyshev nodes onto the basis vectors to obtain the\nreconstruction coefficients. These complex coefficients\nare rotated as described above, and then used to obtain the interpolation coefficients. Again, 40 \u00d7 40 test\nwaveforms from within the parameter space, laid out\nin a grid, are used for computing mismatches between\nthe interpolated waveforms and the original waveforms.\nWe find comparable interpolation mismatches for these\nnon-whitened waveforms, shown in figure 3, as for the\nwhitened waveforms.\n\nResults have been presented for both whitened waveforms, and raw waveforms. The former could be useful in the context of parameter estimation associated\nwith compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitationalwave (GW) signals, which frequently uses Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain methods to measure the likelihood ratio\nfrom many points in parameter space. This requires the\ngeneration of the waveforms for each point in parameter\nspace and the overlap computation between the waveform\nand the data. Using the interpolated reconstruction coefficients, the same computation could be approximately\nperformed with generating a subset of the total waveforms, reconstructing the overlap by appropriately recombining the filter outputs from the basis vectors. The\nlatter could be used to accurately interpolate waveforms\nthat are computationally costly to produce, as is the case\nfor numerical relativity waveforms.\nFor future work, these techniques should be expanded\nto include additional dimensions of parameter space (e.g.,\nbinary object spin parameters). In addition, other interpolation schemes that use equispaced or random points\nin parameter space might be found to be favorable for different applications. We also note that these techniques\ncould be applied to other gravitational waveforms such as\nsupernova waveforms where singular value decomposition\nhas also been applied [25], or where other methods have\nbeen used to reduce the rank of the parameter space [26].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nUsing the procedure described above, we have shown\nit is possible to produce gravitational waveforms for ar-\n\nWe would like to thank Christian R\u00f6ver and Ilya Mandel for discussions and comments related to this work.\nResearch at Perimeter Institute is supported through Industry Canada and by the Province of Ontario through\nthe Ministry of Research & Innovation.
