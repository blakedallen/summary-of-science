Introduction. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging technique which has applications, e.g., in medical imaging, process tomography,\nand nondestructive testing of materials [3, 5, 31]. The objective of EIT is to reconstruct the admittivity distribution inside a physical body \u03a9 from boundary measurements of current and voltage. The most accurate model for EIT is the complete electrode model (CEM), which takes into account electrode shapes and contact impedances\nat electrode-object interfaces [6].\nA real-life measurement setting of EIT typically contains more unknowns than the\nmere admittivity distribution: The exact electrode locations, the contact impedances\nand the shape of the imaged object are not necessarily known accurately. (As an example, consider a medical application where the body shape and the contact impedances\nvary from patient to patient.) These kinds of inaccuracies comprise a considerable\ndifficulty for establishing EIT as a practical imaging modality since it is well known\nthat even slight mismodelling can quite easily ruin the reconstruction of the admittivity [2, 4, 21]. The problems resulting from the aforementioned model uncertainties\nhave partly been resolved in earlier works: Two alternative ways to handle unknown\ncontact impedances have been introduced in [24, 33], and fine-tuning the information\non electrode positions has been considered in [8].

HYV\u00d6NEN, A. SEPP\u00c4NEN AND S. STABOULIS\n\ntackling the problem with an unknown object boundary shape is given in the following;\nfor a more extensive discussion, see [26].\nUndoubtedly the most common way to treat problems resulting from an inaccurately known boundary shape is the use of difference imaging, where the alteration in\nthe admittivity distribution is reconstructed on the basis of the difference between EIT\nmeasurements corresponding to two time instants (or frequencies) [1]. The method\nis based on the idea that the modeling errors are partly removed when difference\ndata are used - given that the boundary shape remains unchanged between the two\nmeasurements. However, the difference imaging approach is highly approximative,\nbecause it relies on a linearization of the highly nonlinear forward model of EIT.\nMoreover, even if difference data are available, the boundary shape may also have\nchanged between the measurements. This is the case, e.g., when imaging a human\nchest during a breathing cycle. A successful approach to coping with an unknown\nobject boundary in absolute EIT imaging was suggested by Kolehmainen, Lassas and\nOla [19, 20]. Their method is based on allowing slightly anisotropic conductivities and\non the use of sophisticated mathematical instruments such as quasiconformal maps\nand Teichm\u00fcller spaces. In [25] the so-called approximation error approach [18] was\nadapted to the compensation for errors resulting from an inaccurately known boundary shape in the framework of EIT. The approximation error method is based on\nthe Bayesian inversion paradigm; the governing idea is to represent the error due to\ninaccurate modeling of the target as an auxiliary noise process. The (second order)\nstatistics of the modeling error are approximated via simulations based on prior probability models for the admittivity and the boundary shape. The application of EIT to\nimaging of human thorax was considered in [25], where the approximated statistics of\nthe modeling error were computed based on an atlas of anatomical CT chest images.\nIn [26], the method was further developed to allow the reconstruction of the boundary\nshape. See also [29, 30], where an optimization based technique was applied to the\nestimation of partially unknown boundary shape in process tomography applications.\nThis work introduces an iterative Newton-type output least squares algorithm\nthat tolerates uncertainties in the geometry of the imaged object. To be more precise,\nour aim is to include the estimation of the shape of the object boundary as a part\nof the reconstruction method. The required Fr\u00e9chet derivative of the measurement\nmap of the CEM with respect to the exterior boundary shape is obtained with the\nhelp of domain derivative techniques stemming from [22, 12, 13, 16]; see also [10] for a\ngeneral theory of shape differentiation. However, unlike in [22, 12, 13, 16], the elliptic\nboundary value problem defining the derivative falls outside the standard H 1 (\u03a9)based variational theory due to Dirac delta type boundary conditions on the edges of\nthe electrodes. This difficulty is tackled following the guidelines in [8], where Fr\u00e9chet\nderivatives with respect to electrode shapes were considered, resulting in a well-posed\n'derivative problem' that is uniquely solvable in H 1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9), \u000f > 0.\nOur approach is made computationally more tractable by introducing a dual\nmethod for sampling the H 1\u2212\u000f -regular shape derivative; in particular, it turns out that\nthe reconstruction algorithm can be implemented without having to solve any forward\nproblems with distributional boundary conditions. This observation is concretized by\nthe numerical examples clearly demonstrating that the electrode measurements of\nEIT carry information on both the admittivity distribution and the object boundary\nshape. The numerical studies are based on simulated measurement data and carried\nout in three-dimensions, with the corresponding parameter choices founded on the\nBayesian paradigm [18].\n\n\fRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\n3\n\nThis text is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the CEM and its fundamental\nproperties. The main Fr\u00e9chet differentiability result is formulated in Section 3 and its\nproof is given in Section 4. Section 5 introduces the reconstruction algorithm, which is\nthen tested numerically in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 lists the concluding remarks.\n2. Complete electrode model. Let \u03a9 \u2282 Rn , n = 2 or 3, be a bounded domain\nand assume that its boundary \u2202\u03a9 is an orientable C \u221e -manifold. We denote by \u03c3 : \u03a9 \u2192\nCn\u00d7n the electrical admittivity distribution of \u03a9 and assume that it satisfies the\nfollowing, physically reasonable conditions [3]:\n\u03c3 = \u03c3T ,\n\nRe (\u03c3\u03be * \u03be) \u2265 C1 |\u03be|2 ,\n\n|\u03c3\u03be * \u03be| \u2264 C2 |\u03be|2\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor some constants C1 , C2 > 0 and for all \u03be \u2208 Cn almost everywhere in \u03a9.\nAssume that the boundary \u2202\u03a9 is partially covered with M \u2208 N \\ {1} wellseparated, open, bounded and connected electrodes {Em }M\nm=1 , i.e.,\nEm \u2282 \u2202\u03a9, m = 1, . . . , M,\n\nand E j \u2229 E k = \u2205,\n\nj 6= k.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe electrodes are modelled as ideal conductors. The union of the electrodes is denoted by E = \u222am Em , and the frequency domain representations of the time-harmonic\nM\nelectrode current and potential patterns by the vectors I = [Im ]M\nm=1 and U = [Um ]m=1\nM\nof C , respectively, where Im , Um \u2208 C correspond to the measurements on the mth\nelectrode. Take note that the current vector I, actually, belongs to the subspace\n\u001a\n\u001b\nM\nX\nM\nM\n(2.3)\nC\u0005 := [c1 , . . . , cM ] \u2208 C\ncm = 0\nm=1\n\ndue to to the current conservation law.

The definition of H1 (\u03a9) as a quotient space emphasizes\nthe freedom in the choice of the ground level of potential; in other words, one can\nnever measure absolute potentials, only potential differences.\nThe weak formulation of the CEM forward problem (2.5) is to find (u, U ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9)\nthat satisfies [28]\nB{(u, U ), (v, V )} =\n\nM\nX\nm=1\n\nIm V m\n\nfor all (v, V ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9),\n\n(2.6)\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

This procedure also provides the estimate\nk(U, u)kH1 (\u03a9) \u2264 C|I|,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the constant of continuity C = C(\u03a9, \u03c3, z) can be chosen independently of the\nelectrodes if it is assumed that\nmin |Em | \u2265 c\n\n(2.9)\n\n1\u2264m\u2264M\n\nfor some constant c > 0 (cf., e.g., [11, (2.4)]). In the rest of this work, we make the\nassumption (2.9) on the considered electrode configurations implicitly.\nAn ideal measurement corresponding to the CEM provides the electrode voltages\nU \u2208 CM /C for some applied current pattern I \u2208 CM\n\u0005 . For a given measurement\nM\nsetting {\u03a9, E, \u03c3, z}, we thus define the measurement operator R : CM\n\u0005 \u2192 C /C by\nR : I 7\u2192 U.\n\n(2.10)\n\nObviously, R is linear and bounded (cf. (2.5) and (2.8)), with a constant of continuity\nthat can be chosen independently of the electrode configuration under the assumption (2.9).\nTo conclude this section, we note that for smooth \u03c3 the interior potential has\nmore regularity, namely\n\u03bd * \u03c3\u2207u|E \u2208 H 1 (E),\n\n1/2\u2212\u000f\n\n\u03bd * \u03c3\u2207u|\u2202\u03a9 \u2208 H\u0005\n\n(\u2202\u03a9),\n\nu \u2208 H 2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9)/C\n\nfor all \u000f > 0, as reasoned in [8, Remark 1]. When appropriate, we emphasize the last\nstatement by writing (u, U ) \u2208 H2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) := (H 2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) \u2295 CM )/C.\n3. Shape derivative. In this section, we introduce the derivative of the CEM\nmeasurement map with respect to perturbations of the object boundary \u2202\u03a9. We begin\nby specifying how exactly the boundary is perturbed.\nFor h \u2208 C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) we define\nF [h](x) = x + h(x),\n\nx \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\n\n\fRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\n5\n\nand use the abbreviation \u2202\u03a9h for the perturbed boundary, that is,\n\u2202\u03a9h = F [h](\u2202\u03a9) = {y \u2208 Rn | y = F [h](x) for some x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9} .\nThe open, origin-centered ball of radius d > 0 in the topology of C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) is denoted\nby Bd , i.e.,\n\b\nBd = h \u2208 C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) khkC 1 (\u2202\u03a9,Rn ) < d .\nFollowing [10], we introduce a special family of diffeomorphisms of Rn to itself:\n\b\nF01 = F : Rn \u2192 Rn F \u2212 id \u2208 C01 (Rn , Rn ) and F \u22121 \u2208 C 1 (Rn , Rn ) ,\nwhere C01 (Rn , Rn ) denotes the space of continuously differentiable vector fields that\ntogether with their partial derivatives vanish at infinity. In particular, when equipped\nwith the natural norm, C01 (Rn , Rn ) is a Banach space (cf. [10, p. 68]). The following\nproposition lists some fundamental properties of F [h] = id + h for h \u2208 Bd with small\nenough d > 0.\nProposition 3.1. There exists d = d(\u03a9) > 0 such that the following hold:\n(a) For every h \u2208 Bd , \u2202\u03a9h is the boundary of a bounded C 1 -domain \u03a9h , and the\nmapping F [h] is a C 1 -diffeomorphism from \u2202\u03a9 onto \u2202\u03a9h ;\n(b) There exists an extension operator E : Bd \u2192 C01 (Rn , Rn ) such that\nE[h]|\u2202\u03a9 = h,\n\nkE[h]kC 1 (Rn ,Rn ) \u2264 C(\u03a9)khkC 1 (\u2202\u03a9,Rn )\n\nand the extended mapping\nF [E[h]] = id + E[h]\nbelongs to F01 for all h \u2208 Bd .\nProof. The first part of the claim follows from an application of the implicit\nfunction theorem in local coordinates on \u2202\u03a9. The second part can be deduced, e.g.,\nby first forcing h to zero in a tubular neighborhood of \u2202\u03a9 and then using similar\narguments as on page 78 of [10].\nIf there is no danger of a confusion, we abuse the notation by denoting the extensions E[h] and F [E[h]] by the original symbols h and F [h], respectively. Moreover,\nwe assume implicitly that d > 0 is as introduced in Proposition 3.1.\nObviously, the measurement operator of the CEM may be considered as a map\nM\nfrom Bd \u00d7 CM\n\u0005 to C /C, i.e.,\nR : (h, I) 7\u2192 U [h],\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere (u[h], U [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9h ) is the unique solution of (2.5) when \u03a9 is replaced by\nh\n\u03a9h and the electrodes Em by Em\n:= F [h](Em ) \u2282 \u2202\u03a9h , m = 1, . . . , M . To make\nthis definition unambiguous and to simplify the analysis that follows, we assume that\n\u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (Rn , Cn\u00d7n ) with the bounds (2.1) satisfied everywhere in Rn , i.e., that the\nadmittivity distribution is defined in everywhere in Rn - or at least in some proper\nneighborhood of \u03a9. As a further simplification, we also assume that (in the threedimensional case) the electrode boundaries \u2202Em , m = 1, . . . , M , are smooth curves.\nWe denote by h\u03c4 and h\u03bd the tangential (vector) and normal (scalar) components\nof h \u2208 Bd , respectively, that is, we have the (unique) decomposition h = h\u03c4 + h\u03bd \u03bd.\nOne might expect that it is enough to consider perturbations that belong to the\n\n\f6\n\nJ. DARD\u00c9, N. HYV\u00d6NEN, A. SEPP\u00c4NEN AND S. STABOULIS\n\nnormal bundle of the boundary, i.e., ones that have vanishing tangential components.\nHowever, this turns out to be a false intuition, because tangential vector fields typically\naffect the measurement map in the 'first order' by moving the electrodes (cf. [8]) -\neven though they only define 'second order' perturbations of the object boundary \u2202\u03a9\nitself.\nM\nTheorem 3.2. Under the above assumptions, the operator R : Bd \u00d7CM\n\u0005 \u2192 C /C\nis Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at the origin with respect to the first variable, i.e., there exists\nM\na bounded bilinear operator R0 : C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) \u00d7 CM\n\u0005 \u2192 C /C such that\nlim\n\nh\u21920\n\n1\nM\nkR[h] \u2212 R[0] \u2212 R0 hkL(CM\n=0\n\u0005 ,C /C)\nkhkC 1 (\u2202\u03a9,Rn )\n\nin C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ).\nIn the following, we will prove Theorem 3.2 in three dimensions, i.e. for n = 3,\nwhich is the more challenging case. The two-dimensional counterpart can be obtained\nby following a similar line of reasoning.\nThe derivative R0 of Theorem 3.2 can, in fact, be given explicitly. To this end,\nlet H \u2208 C \u221e (\u2202\u03a9) be the mean curvature function defined so that it is positive if the\nsurface turns away from the exterior unit normal, and consider the bounded surface\ndivergence operator (cf., e.g., [7])\nDiv : [H s (\u2202\u03a9)]n\u03c4 \u2192 H s\u22121 (\u2202\u03a9),\n\ns \u2208 R,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith the weak definition\nhDiv v, \u03c6i\u2202\u03a9 = \u2212hv, Grad \u03c6i\u2202\u03a9 ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (\u2202\u03a9),\n\nwhere Grad denotes the surface gradient (cf., e.g., [10]). We also introduce a family\n\u22121/2\u2212\u000f\nof distributions {\u03b4m }M\n(\u2202\u03a9), \u000f > 0, defined through\nm=1 \u2282 H\nZ\nh\u03b4m , vi\u2202\u03a9 =\nv ds,\nv \u2208 H 1/2+\u000f (\u2202\u03a9),\n\u2202E m\n\nfor m = 1, . . . , M . Notice that any v \u2208 H 1/2+\u000f (\u2202\u03a9), \u000f > 0, has a well defined\nrestriction v|\u2202E \u2208 H \u000f (\u2202E) due to the trace theorem, and thus the definition of the\nfamily {\u03b4m }M\nm=1 is unambiguous. Moreover, we denote the characteristic function of\nEm \u2282 \u2202\u03a9 by \u03c7m , m = 1, . . . , M , and the unit exterior normal of \u2202E in the tangent\nbundle of \u2202\u03a9 by \u03bd\u2202E .\nWith these tools in hand, let us consider the boundary value problem\n\u2207 * \u03c3\u2207u0 = 0\n\nin \u03a9,\n\nM\nm\nX\nX\n1\n1\n\u03bd * \u03c3\u2207u0 \u2212\n(U 0 \u2212 u0 )\u03c7m = f1 +\n(f2 \u03c7m + f3 \u03b4m )\nz\nz\nm=1 m\nZ\nZ\nZ m=1 m\n0\n(Um\n\u2212 u0 ) dS = \u2212\nf2 dS \u2212\nf3 ds,\nEm\n\nEm\n\non \u2202\u03a9,\nm = 1, . . . , M.\n\n\u2202Em\n\n(3.3)\nHere, the inputs f1 \u2208 H \u22121/2\u2212\u000f (\u2202\u03a9), f2 \u2208 H 1/2\u2212\u000f (E) and f3 \u2208 H 1\u2212\u000f (\u2202E) are defined\nwith the help of (u, U ) \u2208 H2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9), i.e., the unperturbed solution of (2.5):\nf1 = Div(h\u03bd (\u03c3\u2207u|\u2202\u03a9 )\u03c4 ),\n\u0010\n\u2202u \u0011\nf2 |Em = h\u03bd (n \u2212 1)H(Um \u2212 u) \u2212\n\u2202\u03bd\nf3 |\u2202Em = (h * \u03bd\u2202E )(Um \u2212 u)|\u2202Em .\n\n,\nEm\n\n\f7\n\nRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\nNotice that the claimed regularity of f1 , f2 and f3 follows from (3.2) and (consecutive)\napplications of the trace theorem. It turns out that problem (3.3) is uniquely solvable\nin H1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9), and that the corresponding solution defines the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of\nTheorem 3.2.\nTheorem 3.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, the boundary value\nproblem (3.3) has a unique solution (u0 [h], U 0 [h]) \u2208 H1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9), \u000f > 0, for any\nh \u2208 C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ). Moreover, the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of Theorem 3.2, i.e., R0 :\nM\nC 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) \u00d7 CM\n\u0005 \u2192 C /C, is given by\nR0 : (h, I) 7\u2192 U 0 [h].\nAt first sight it may seem that Theorem 3.3 is not very practical as it defines the\nFr\u00e9chet derivative of R with the help of a boundary value problem that falls outside\nthe H 1 -based variational theory. Fortunately, there also exists a dual approach for\nsampling the shape derivative.\nCorollary 3.4. Let (\u0169, \u0168 ) \u2208 H2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9), \u000f > 0, be the solution of (2.5) for some\n1\nn\nM\nelectrode current pattern I \u0303 \u2208 CM\n\u0005 . Then, for any (h, I) \u2208 C (\u2202\u03a9, R ) \u00d7 C\u0005 it holds\nthat\nM\nX\n\n(R0 (h, I))m I \u0303m = \u2212\n\nZ\nh\u03bd (\u03c3\u2207u)\u03c4 * (\u2207\u0169)\u03c4 dS\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\nm=1\n\nZ\nM\n\u0010\nX\n\u2202u \u0011\n1\nh\u03bd (n \u2212 1)(Um \u2212 u)H \u2212\n(\u0168m \u2212 \u0169) dS\n\u2212\nz\n\u2202\u03bd\nm=1 m Em\nZ\nM\nX\n1\n\u2212\n(h * \u03bd\u2202E )(Um \u2212 u)(\u0168m \u2212 \u0169) ds,\nz\nm=1 m \u2202Em\nwhere (u, U ) \u2208 H2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) is the solution of (2.5).\n4. Proof of the main result. Before moving on to prove Theorems 3.2 and\n3.3 and Corollary 3.4, we give a brief summary of the variational technique on which\nthe proof is based. A more complete reasoning in a slightly different framework can\nbe found in [8, Section 5.1].\nLet F = F [h] = id + h \u2208 F01 , with h \u2208 Bd , be as in the previous section. We\nintroduce a pullback operator F \u2217 : H 1 (\u03a9h ) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a9) defined by F \u2217 v = v \u25e6 F |\u03a9 ; it\nis easy to see that F \u2217 is a linear isomorphism. A simple change of variables applied\nto the variational equation defining (u[h], U [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9h ), cf. (3.1), shows that the\ndifference of the pullback pair (F \u2217 u[h], U [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9) and the unperturbed solution\n(u, U ) = (u[0], U [0]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9) satisfies (cf., e.g., [16])\nB{(F \u2217 u[h] \u2212 u, U [h] \u2212 U ), (v, V )}\nZ\n=\n(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2217 [h]) \u2207(F \u2217 u[h]) * \u2207v dx\n\u03a9\n\nZ\nM\nX\n1\n+\n(Um [h] \u2212 F \u2217 u[h])(V m \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 |Jac F |) dS\nz\nm\nE\nm\nm=1\nfor all (v, V ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9). Here, the pullback admittivity \u03c3 \u2217 [h] is defined as\n\u03c3 \u2217 [h] = |JF | JF\u22121 (F \u2217 \u03c3)(JF\u22121 )T ,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\f8\n\nJ. DARD\u00c9, N. HYV\u00d6NEN, A.

Moreover,\nit follows from the perturbation analysis in [12, 13] that modulo O(khk2C 1 (Rn ,Rn ) ) it\nholds that\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2217 [h] = \u03c3JhT + Jh \u03c3 \u2212 (h * \u2207 + \u2207 * h)\u03c3,\n\n(4.2)\n\n1 \u2212 |Jac F | = \u2212(n \u2212 1)Hh\u03bd \u2212 Div h\u03c4 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere h * \u2207\u03c3 is defined as the matrix (h * \u2207\u03c3ij )ni,j=1 . In consequence, in order to\nestimate the difference (F \u2217 u[h] \u2212 u, U [h] \u2212 U ), it seems reasonable to consider the\nbounded sesquilinear functional \u039b : C 1 (Rn , Rn ) \u00d7 H1 (\u03a9) \u2192 C defined by (cf. [8,\n(19)])\nZ\n\u0001\n\u039b[h](v, V ) =\n\u03c3JhT + Jh \u03c3 \u2212 (h * \u2207 + \u2207 * h)\u03c3 \u2207u * \u2207v dx\n\u03a9\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\nM\nX\n1\n(Um \u2212 u)(V m \u2212 v)((n \u2212 1)Hh\u03bd + Div h\u03c4 ) dS,\nz\nm=1 m Em\n\nand the corresponding h-parametrized variational problem\nB{(w[h], W [h]), (v, V )} = \u039b[h](v, V )\n\nfor all (v, V ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich has a unique solution in H1 (\u03a9) due to the Lax\u2013Milgram lemma. The following\nproposition is a straightforward variation of [8, Proposition 5.4].\nProposition 4.1. Let (u, U ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9) and (u[h], U [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9h ) be as defined in\nSection 3 and (w[h], W [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9) the unique solution of (4.4). Then, the estimate\nk(F \u2217 u[h] \u2212 u, U [h] \u2212 U ) \u2212 (w[h], W [h])kH1 (\u03a9) \u2264 C|I|khk2C 1 (\u2202\u03a9,Rn )\nholds with a constant C > 0 that can be chosen independently of I \u2208 CM\n\u0005 and h \u2208 Bd .\nAlthough the map h 7\u2192 W [h] is a first order approximation of h 7\u2192 (R[h] \u2212\nR[0])I = U [h] \u2212 U [0] around the origin, it does not provide a satisfactory definition\nfor the Fr\u00e9chet derivative h 7\u2192 R0 [h]. Indeed, although h 7\u2192 W [h] is clearly linear with\nrespect to the extension h = E[h] \u2208 C01 (Rn , Rn ), it is not self-evident that the same\nalso holds for the original perturbation h \u2208 C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) as required by Theorem 3.2.\nMoreover, from the computational view point, the extension of h to the whole of Rn\nis a nuisance that one wants to avoid.\nTo get rid of this problem, we proceed as in [8] and modify the first component of\n(w[h], W [h]) in an appropriate way. This procedure involves including a directional\nderivative of the interior potential component of the unperturbed solution (u, U ) \u2208\nH2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) as an argument of the sesquilinear form B : H1 (\u03a9) \u00d7 H1 (\u03a9) \u2192 C. Since the\nderivatives of u are merely in H 1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) such analysis cannot be carried out without any\nmodifications. For this reason, we introduce a sequence of smooth approximations for\nu \u2208 H 2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9)/C, and subsequently also for (w[h], W [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9). As in [8, Subsection\n5.4], we may pick a sequence (u(j) , U (j) ) \u2208 (C \u221e (\u03a9) \u2295 CM )/C, j = 1, 2, . . . , such that\n\u2207 * \u03c3\u2207u(j) = 0\n\nin \u03a9\n\nand\n\nlim (u(j) , U (j) ) = (u, U )\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nin H2\u2212\u000f (\u03a9).\n\n(4.5)\n\nMoreover, we define (w(j) [h], W (j) [h]) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9) to be the unique element of H1 (\u03a9)\nthat solves the variational problem\nB{(w(j) [h], W (j) [h]), (v, V )} = \u039bj [h](v, V )\n\nfor all (v, V ) \u2208 H1 (\u03a9),\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\n9\n\nwhere the antilinear functional \u039bj [h] : H1 (\u03a9) \u2192 C is defined via replacing (u, U ) by\n(u(j) , U (j) ) in the definition of \u039b[h]. Through a slight variation of the argument in\nthe proof of [8, Lemma 5.7], one easily obtains that\nlim (w(j) [h], W (j) [h]) = (w[h], W [h])\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nin H1 (\u03a9).\n\n(4.7)\n\nWe proceed by defining the 'augmented interior derivatives' by\nw\u0303[h] = w[h] \u2212 h * \u2207u,\n\nw\u0303(j) [h] = w(j) [h] \u2212 h * \u2207u(j) ,\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(4.8)\n\nDue to (4.5) and (4.7), it follows that\nlim (w\u0303(j) [h], W (j) [h]) = (w\u0303[h], W [h])\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nin H1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9)\n\n(4.9)\n\nfor any \u000f > 0 (cf. [23]). In the following, we will show that (w\u0303[h], W [h]) \u2208 H1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) is\nthe unique solution of (3.3) for h \u2208 Bd . In particular, the pair (w\u0303[h], W [h]) turns out\nto be independent of the extension of h \u2208 C 1 (\u2202\u03a9, Rn ) to the whole of Rn .\nProof of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3. In the first part of the proof, we show that the\nderivative problem (3.3) is uniquely solvable, with the corresponding solution being\nthe above constructed pair (w\u0303[h], W [h]) \u2208 H1\u2212\u000f (\u03a9) if h \u2208 Bd . First of all, we note\nthat the uniqueness of the solution can be proved in exactly the same way as in the\nfirst part of the proof of [8, Theorem 6.1], which means that we can focus solely on\nthe existence. In case that \u03bd * h \u2261 0 and h \u2208 Bd , the fact that (w\u0303[h], W [h]) is a\nsolution to (3.3) follows from the second and third parts of the proof of [8, Theorem\n6.1]. Due to the linearity of the right-hand side of (3.3) with respect to h, the unique\nsolvability of (3.3) thus follows if we are able to show that (w\u0303[h], W [h]) is a solution\nalso if h = h\u03bd \u03bd \u2208 Bd .

In this section, we introduce our numerical algorithm for the simultaneous reconstruction of the admittivity distribution and\nthe object boundary. It is assumed that the object of interest \u03a9 \u2282 R3 is a cylinder D \u00d7 (0, h0 ), where D \u2282 R2 is a simply connected and bounded cross-section\nshape, and h0 > 0 the known height of the body. The electrodes are of the form\nEm = \u03b3m \u00d7 (0, h0 ), with each \u03b3m being a connected part of \u2202D with a known length,\ni.e., the electrodes are rectangular, homogeneous in the vertical direction and assumed\nto be of a known width and the same height as the object itself. In particular, if the\nadmittivity distribution were also homogeneous in the vertical direction - as it is\nin our numerical experiments -, the measurement setting could be modelled by a\ntwo-dimensional forward problem. Be that as it may, we carry out all numerical computations in three dimensions in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our method\nin a realistic framework. Moreover, we only consider real-valued and isotropic electrical admittivities, i.e., \u03c3 : \u03a9 \u2192 R+ . Note that the above assumptions on the target\nare made only for the sake of simplicity; the generalization of the algorithm to more\ngeneral three-dimensional settings is conceptually straightforward.\nIn the following three sections we outline the ideas behind our reconstruction\nmethod, but do not discuss all details about, e.g., the form of the smoothness prior\nfor the admittivity; see, e.g., [17, 18] for more information.\n5.1. Parametrization of the unknowns. In many practical situations the\nexamined body has a star-shaped cross-section. In consequence, we search for the\nunknown boundary \u2202D as a C \u221e -curve parametrized by\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\nN\nX\ncos \u03c6\n(\u03b1j cos j\u03c6 + \u03b1j+N sin j\u03c6)\n\u03b3\u03b1 (\u03c6) = \u03b10 +\n,\n\u03b10 , . . . , \u03b12N \u2208 R, (5.1)\nsin \u03c6\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the polar angle and the coefficients \u03b1 = [\u03b10 , . . . , \u03b12N ]T \u2208 R2N +1 are assumed to be such that the curve does not intersect itself. Let D\u03b1 denote the bounded\nset of R2 with \u2202D\u03b1 = \u03b3\u03b1 ([0, 2\u03c0]) and furthermore define \u03a9\u03b1 = D\u03b1 \u00d7 (0, h0 ). As\nit is assumed that the width of the (rectangular) electrodes is known, we may thus\nparametrize them by their initial polar angles \u03b8m , m = 1, . . . , M , in the counterclockwise direction. The vector containing these angles is denoted by \u03b8 = [\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8M ]T .\nWe assume that the electrodes are numbered in the natural order, that is, the terminal\nangle of an electrode precedes the initial angle of the following one.\nApproximate forward solutions to (2.5) in \u03a9\u03b1 are computed by a finite element\nmethod (FEM). The FEM solver used in this work is an adaptation of the implementation in [32]. In the FE scheme, we discretize the computational domain \u03a9\u03b1 into\ntetrahedrons and approximate the distributions of admittivity and potential in piecewise linear and quadratic bases, respectively. In our reconstruction algorithm, the\ngeometric parameters \u03b1 and \u03b8 change iteratively and consequently \u03a9\u03b1 and its FEM\nmesh also change at each step. In order to fix the admittivity discretization independently of such deformations, we pick a sufficiently large cylinder \u03a3 = B \u00d7 (0, h0 ), with\na discoidal base B inside which we let the cross-section\nP D\u03b1 evolve. Given this background cylinder, we look for admittivities of the form k \u03c3k \u03c6k , where {\u03c3k } \u2282 (0, \u221e)\nand {\u03c6k } is the piecewise linear basis related to a fixed tetrahedral mesh of \u03a3. The\nadmittivity values are transformed between the fixed 'reconstruction mesh' of \u03a3 and\nthe varying ones in \u03a9\u03b1 via linear interpolation.\n5.2. Bayesian framework. Although our reconstruction algorithm, which will\nbe introduced in Section 5.3, cannot be considered purely Bayesian, its underlying\n\n\f13\n\nRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\nmotivation is statistical, and thus the basic ideas behind Bayesian inversion are outlined in the following. In the Bayesian approach, all quantities are considered as\nrandom variables with some assumed prior probability distributions. Combining the\ninformation from the prior with the measurement data, one gets the updated posterior\ndistribution for the parameters of interest [18].\n\u22121\nM\nLet {I (j) }M\nj=1 be a basis of R\u0005 . The voltages measured at the electrodes on the\nboundary of \u03a9\u03b1 are modelled as\nV (j) = U (j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) + \u03b7 (j) \u2208 RM ,\n\nj = 1, . . . , M \u2212 1.\n\n(5.2)\n\nHere, (u(j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8), U (j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8)) \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9\u03b1 ) \u2295 RM\n\u0005 is the solution of (2.5) in the domain \u03a9\u03b1 with a real-valued admittivity \u03c3, when the net electrode current pattern\nI (j) is injected through the M electrodes parametrized by their initial polar angles\n\u03b8 \u2208 RM . Notice that we have fixed the ground level of potential by requiring that\nU (j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) has vanishing mean. The components of the noise vector \u03b7 (j) \u2208 RM are\nassumed to be independent realizations of zero mean Gaussian random variables. To\nsimplify the notation, we pile the electrode currents, potentials and noise vectors into\narrays of length M 2 \u2212 M , i.e., employ the shorthand notations\nI = [(I (1) )T , . . . , (I (M \u22121) )T ]T ,\nV = [(V (1) )T , . . . , (V (M \u22121) )T ]T\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u03b7 = [(\u03b7 (1) )T , . . . , (\u03b7 (M \u22121) )T ]T\nU(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I) = [U (1) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8)T , . . . , U (M \u22121) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8)T ]T .\nThis allows us to write the noisy measurement model as\nV = U(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I) + \u03b7 \u2208 RM\n\n2\n\n\u2212M\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe discretized admittivity is given a homogeneous Gaussian smoothness prior\nwith a covariance \u0393\u03c3 and a positive homogeneous mean \u03c3 ? ; for more details about\nsmoothness priors, see [18]. To include control over the geometric information, the\ncoefficients \u03b1 are provided with a Gaussian prior with a mean \u03b1? \u2208 R2N +1 and a\ncovariance matrix \u0393\u03b1 = diag(a20 , . . . , a22N ), where\n(\nl\u2212s a,\naj =\n(l \u2212 N )\u2212s a,\n\nl = 0, . . . , N\nl = N + 1, . . . , 2N.\n\n(5.5)\n\nBy adjusting the parameters s, a > 0, one may tune the prior assumption on the\nregularity of the object boundary.

DARD\u00c9, N. HYV\u00d6NEN, A. SEPP\u00c4NEN AND S. STABOULIS\n\n5.3. The (quasi-Bayesian) iterative algorithm. According to our experience, the EIT measurements modelled by the CEM are typically more sensitive to\nthe exterior boundary shape and electrode locations than to the internal admittivity\ndistribution. As a consequence, it seems to be computationally advantageous to first\nfix a crude constant approximation for the admittivity distribution, then use a (deterministic) iterative scheme to come up with a relatively good model for the object\nboundary and electrode positions, and finally use these preliminary estimates as the\nprior expectations in the to-be-minimized MAP functional (5.6). It should be emphasized that such an initialization of the means makes our algorithm strictly speaking\nnon-Bayesian, since the choice of the priors should be independent of the data. Be\nthat as it may, according to our experience, such a preliminary step leads to faster\nand more reliable convergence. (We do not claim, however, that this kind of two-step\nimplementation is the only feasible choice.)\nTo be more precise, we first choose the covariance matrices \u0393\u03b7 , \u0393\u03c3 , \u0393\u03b1 and \u0393\u03b8\naccording to the assumed prior information on the variation of the corresponding\nparameters, pick an initial guess (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ) for the measurement geometry (corresponding to some disk-shaped cross-section in all of our numerical studies), and fix \u03c3 ?\nto be the constant admittivity that minimizes the output least squares part of \u03a6, i.e.,\n(U(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I) \u2212 V)T \u0393\u22121\n\u03b7 (U(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I) \u2212 V)\nwhen (\u03b1, \u03b8) = (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ). Subsequently, the following two-stage scheme is employed:\nFirst stage of the algorithm: choosing the prior means. We apply a\nLevenberg\u2013Marquardt type method in order to choose the geometry parameters that\nare used as the prior means (\u03b1? , \u03b8? ) when \u03a6 of (5.6) is minimized simultaneously with\nrespect to all of its variables in the second stage of the algorithm:\n1. Fix \u03c3 = \u03c3 ? in (5.6), consider \u03a6 as a function of only two variables \u03b1 and \u03b8,\nand set (\u03b1? , \u03b8? ) = (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ).\n2. Calculate the Gauss\u2013Newton minimization direction for \u03a6(\u03b1, \u03b8) of (5.6) at\n(\u03b1, \u03b8) = (\u03b1? , \u03b8? ); see, e.g., [27].\n3. Minimize \u03a6(\u03b1, \u03b8) over the line passing through (\u03b1? , \u03b8? ) in the Gauss\u2013Newton\ndirection by the Golden section line search. Redefine (\u03b1? , \u03b8? ) to be the obtained minimizer.\n4. If satisfactory convergence is achieved, terminate the iteration. Otherwise,\nreturn to step 2.\nThis part of the reconstruction algorithm is stable and does not, in particular, seem\nvery sensitive with respect to the choice of the covariance matrices in (5.6).\nSecond stage of the algorithm: finding the MAP estimate. After the\nprior means (\u03c3 ? , \u03b1? , \u03b8? ) have been chosen in the earlier parts of the algorithm, the\nfinal stage consists of minimizing \u03a6 of (5.6) by the Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm:\n1. Set k = 1 and (\u03c3 (k) , \u03b1(k) , \u03b8(k) ) = (\u03c3 ? , \u03b1? , \u03b8? ).\n2. Calculate the Gauss\u2013Newton direction for \u03a6(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) of (5.6) at (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) =\n(\u03c3 (k) , \u03b1(k) , \u03b8(k) ).\n3. Minimize \u03a6 over the line passing through (\u03c3 (k) , \u03b1(k) , \u03b8(k) ) in the\nGauss\u2013Newton direction by the Golden section line search and define\n(\u03c3 (k+1) , \u03b1(k+1) , \u03b8(k+1) ) to be the obtained minimizer.\n4. Unless satisfactory convergence is achieved, increase k by one and return to\nstep 2.\n\n\fRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\n15\n\nFor the computation of the needed Gauss\u2013Newton directions, one needs the Jacobian of U(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I) with respect to \u03c3, \u03b1 and \u03b8. By the Jacobian with respect to\n\u03c3 we mean the one with respect to the coefficients of the piecewise linear basis in\nthe 'reconstruction cylinder' \u03a3 introduced in the last paragraph of Subsection 5.1.\n(Notice that the coefficients of the basis functions supported outside \u03a9\u03b1 do not play\na role in U(\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8; I), but they do affect the last term on the first line of (5.6).) For\nthe estimation of the derivatives with respect to \u03c3 and \u03b8, we refer to [17] and [8], respectively. By the dual relation (3.4), the Jacobian with respect to \u03b1 can be sampled\nvia trivial linear algebra (a change of basis) after evaluating the expressions on the\nright-hand side of (3.4) for each triplet\nh(\u03c6) = \u03c8 (l) (\u03c6)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\ncos \u03c6\n,\nsin \u03c6\n\n(u, U ) = (u(i) , U (i) ),\n\n(\u0169, \u0168 ) = (u(j) , U (j) )\n\nover the indices l = 0, . . . , 2N and i, j = 1, . . . , M \u2212 1. Here, (u(j) , U (j) ) =\n(u(j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8), U (j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8)) is the solution of (2.5) for I = I (j) and the setting\nparametrized by (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8), and \u03c8l (\u03c6) = cos l\u03c6 if l \u2264 N and \u03c8l (\u03c6) = sin(l \u2212 N )\u03c6\nwhen l \u2265 N + 1. We emphasize that one needs not solve any extra forward problems\nfor this procedure since at each iteration step all the pairs (u(j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8), U (j) (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8)),\nj = 1, . . . , M \u2212 1, must be computed already for evaluating the functional \u03a6 of (5.6).\nBy the assumption that the electrode width is known, for any given electrode the\nterminal polar angle is a smooth function of the initial one and \u03b1. This functional\ndependence can be written explicitly by employing the arc length formula for the\nparametrization (5.1), and this information can then be included in the Jacobians\nwith the help of the Leibniz rule and the chain rule for the total derivative.\nRemark 5.1. If one chooses to skip the first stage of the above introduced algorithm and use the (simple) initial guess (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ) as the prior mean for the geometric\nparameters in the second stage, with suitable parameter choices the reconstructions for\nthe numerical experiments of the following section typically remain qualitatively the\nsame, but the convergence slows down considerably. What is more, in practice the\ninitial guess (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ) for the measurement geometry is often more accurate than\nthe ones we employ in our numerical experiments, which further reduces the practical\nrelevance of the first stage of the algorithm.\n6. Numerical experiments. Our main aim is not so much to compare the\nfunctionality of our method with reconstruction techniques presented elsewhere, but\nto make an 'internal' comparison between three cases:\n(i) the measurement geometry, i.e. the object shape and the electrode locations,\nis known;\n(ii) the measurement geometry is known inaccurately but this is not taken into\naccount in the algorithm;\n(iii) the unknown boundary shape is estimated simultaneously with the admittivity distribution.\nWe will demonstrate that (i) and (iii) give comparable results, while the quality of\nreconstructions for (ii) is intolerably bad.\nWe present three numerical experiments, in each of which M = 16 identical electrodes of known width are attached to the object of interest. We assume to know the\ncontact impedances and choose the values zm = 1, m = 1, . . . , M . The first experiment, though a bit impractical, acts as an initial probe to test the functionality of\nthe computed Fr\u00e9chet derivatives: we apply (the first part of) our algorithm to the\n\n\f16\n\nJ. DARD\u00c9, N. HYV\u00d6NEN, A. SEPP\u00c4NEN AND S. STABOULIS\n\nshape estimation of a target object with a known homogeneous admittivity distribution. In the second experiment we consider a simple shape (an ellipse) and a smooth\nadmittivity distribution. In the last experiment the object shape is moderately complicated and the admittivity phantom consists of inclusions of constant admittivity\nin a homogeneous background.\nLet \u03c2 be the to-be-reconstructed admittivity and suppose the pair (\u03b2, \u03b8) provides\na parametrization of the target measurement setting in the sense of Section 5.1. To be\nquite precise, the latter statement is a bit ambiguous because none of the considered\ntarget shapes \u2202D can be given in the form (5.1) with a finite N , but for ease of\nnotation we have decided to allow here an 'infinite' shape parameter vector \u03b2. For\neach experiment we simulate the exact data U(\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8; I) using the input current basis\nI (j) = e1 \u2212 ej \u2208 RM\n\u0005 , j = 2, . . . , M , where ej is the jth Euclidean basis vector. Notice\nthat there is no danger of an inverse crime because a new finite element mesh for the\napproximate domain \u03a9\u03b1 is generated at each iteration of the reconstruction algorithm,\nand these meshes differ considerably from the mesh of the target object \u03a9 = \u03a9\u03b2 used\nfor the data simulation.\nThe actual noisy measurement realization V is formed via (5.4), with (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) =\n(j)\n(\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8), by picking a particular noise component \u03b7m , m = 1, . . . , M , j = 1, . . . , M \u22121,\nfrom a zero mean Gaussian distribution with the variance\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\n0.012 |Um\n(\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8)|2 + 0.0012 max |Uk (\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 Ul (\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8)|2 .\n1\u2264k,l\u2264M\n\n(6.1)\n\n(j)\n\nHere, the relation between U(\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8; I) and Um (\u03c2, \u03b2, \u03b8) is as in (5.3). Sections 6.2\nand 6.3, where the cases (i\u2013iii) are compared, work with fixed realizations of the noise\nvector \u03b7 in order to allow a fair comparison.\nFor further justification of the noise model (6.1), see [16], but anyway notice that\n(6.1) corresponds to more than one percent of relative noise in the absolute data, which\nis a substantial amount for an EIT problem. In each numerical experiment we assume\nto know the covariance of the measurement noise, i.e., we use the diagonal covariance\nmatrix defined by the noise model (6.1) as \u0393\u03b7 in (5.6). We do not elaborate on the\nchoice of \u0393\u03c3 in (5.6) in further detail; it is built based on the proper (informative)\nsmoothness prior proposed in [18], reflecting the a priori assumption on the spatial\nvariations of the admittivity.\n6.1. Known homogeneous target admittivity. Figure 6.1 shows the results\nobtained when the first stage of our algorithm is applied to reconstructing the boundary shape and electrode locations for an object with a known homogeneous admittivity\ndistribution \u03c2 \u2261 1. While this situation has minor practical relevance, it serves as a\ntest of the computational techniques for obtaining the derivatives with respect to \u03b1\nand \u03b8. The cylindrical target object is \u03a9 = D \u00d7 (0, h0 ) with h0 = 1, and the curve\n\u2202D is parametrized by\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3.3\ncos \u03c6\n\u2212(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0)6\n+ 1.1e\n+ 0.88 cos \u03c6 sin(\u22122\u03c6)\n.\n\u03b3(\u03c6) =\nsin \u03c6\n(2.22 cos2 \u03c6 + 1.52 sin2 \u03c6)1/2\nThe width of the M = 16 identical electrodes on \u2202D \u00d7 (0, h0 ) is 0.3 and their initial\npolar angles are of the form \u03b8m = 2\u03c0(m \u2212 1)/M + \u03b5m , m = 1, . . . , M , where \u03b5m are\nindependent realizations of a normally distributed random variable with zero mean\nand standard deviation 0.1.\nSince the admittivity is known a priori, we do not estimate \u03c3 ? as explained in the\nbeginning of Section 5.3, but fix it to be identically 1.

(b) Comparison between\nthe exact shape (red solid) and the retrieved one (blue dashed).\nin Section 5.3 is then run with N = 15 and M = 16; in this case the final value of\n(\u03b1? , \u03b8? ) describes the reconstructed measurement geometry. In the construction of\nthe prior covariance \u0393\u03b1 we use (5.5) with the selection a = s = 1 and set \u0393\u03b8 = \u03c4 2 I\nwith \u03c4 = 2\u03c0/M , but the algorithm does not seem to be very sensitive with respect to\nthese choices. Figure 6.1(a) shows the required five iteration steps, one of which is the\neventual reconstruction, obtained by choosing the initial guesses \u03b1(0) = [2.7, 0, . . . , 0]T\n(0)\nand \u03b8m = 2\u03c0(m \u2212 1)/M , m = 1, . . . , M \u2212 1. The final iterate is drawn with solid\nline and the others with dashed line. In Figure 6.1(b), the target curve \u03b3 (red solid)\nis compared with the retrieved one (blue dashed).\nThe algorithm was run with several different target objects and in all cases the\nresults were qualitatively similar to what is illustrated in Figure 6.1, given that the\nexamined shapes were not too complicated: If there were fine structures on a scale\nsmaller than the electrode width, the results were poor. Further, the simpler the\ngeometry, the faster the convergence was. It was also observed that the number\nof coefficients in (5.1) should not be too large, at most about N = 15. A high\nnumber of coefficients results in unstable reconstructions and absurd shapes, with the\nperformance of the algorithm slowing down.\n6.2. Smooth target admittivity. In the second experiment, we apply the\n(whole) simultaneous reconstruction algorithm to data corresponding to a relatively\nsimple target shape and a smooth admittivity distribution illustrated in Figure 6.2(a).\nThe shape of the target object is \u03a9 = D \u00d7 (0, h0 ), h0 = 0.5, where D is an ellipse with\nmajor and minor semi-axes 2 and 1.5, respectively. The admittivity is homogeneous\nin the vertical direction, which allows us to only consider cross-sections in the visualizations. The electrode positions are chosen in the same manner as in the previous\nexample, with the constant electrode width being such that two fifths of \u2202D \u00d7 (0, h0 )\nis covered by the electrodes.\nIn the reconstruction process we seek for a parameter triplet (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) \u2208 RK \u00d7RN \u00d7\nM\nR with N = 7 and M = 16. Here, K is the number of nodes in the (fine enough)\ndiscretization of the background cylinder \u03a3 = B \u00d7 (0, h0 ), with B chosen to be an\norigin-centered disk of radius 3. As the initial guesses, we use \u03b1(0) = [2, 0, . . . , 0]T and\n\n\f18\n\nJ. DARD\u00c9, N. HYV\u00d6NEN, A. SEPP\u00c4NEN AND S.

The prior covariances are constructed by\nselecting a = 0.1, s = 1 for \u0393\u03b1 of (5.5) and \u0393\u03b8 = \u03c4 2 I with \u03c4 = 2\u03c0/M ; see the fourth\nparagraph of Section 6 for an explanation about the choice of \u0393\u03c3 and \u0393\u03b7 .\nThe reconstruction in Figure 6.2(b) was obtained by applying the second stage of\nthe algorithm in Section 5.3 with respect to \u03c3 to the setting where the last two terms\nof (5.6) are deleted and (\u03b1, \u03b8) is fixed to be the initial guess (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ); this approach\ncorresponds to ignoring the incompleteness of the information on the measurement\nconfiguration and assuming stubbornly that the cross-section of the target object\nis a disk with uniformly distributed electrodes on its boundary. The reconstruction\ncorresponding to the precise knowledge of the geometry is depicted in Figure 6.2(c); it\nwas obtained in the same manner as the one in Figure 6.2(b), except this time around\nthe geometry parameters (\u03b1, \u03b8) = (\u03b2, \u03b8) were fixed at the values describing the target\nconfiguration used in the simulation of the measurement data. Figure 6.2(d) visualizes\nsimultaneous retrieval of the admittivity distribution and the measurement geometry;\nthis reconstruction corresponds to application of the whole two-stage reconstruction\nalgorithm of Section 5.3, starting from the initial guess (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ) defined above.\n\n\fRECONSTRUCTION OF OUTER BOUNDARY SHAPE IN EIT\n\n19\n\nFrom Figure 6.2(b), it is obvious that ignoring the incompleteness of the information on the measurement configuration results in severe artefacts in the admittivity\nreconstruction close to the object boundary. On the other hand, a comparison of Figure 6.2(d) with Figures 6.2(c) and 6.2(b) demonstrates that the simultaneous retrieval\nof the admittivity distribution and the measurement setting provides a qualitatively\nsimilar reconstruction as knowing the exact geometry to begin with, and a far better\none than altogether ignoring the inaccuracies in the geometric information.\n6.3. Piecewise constant target admittivity. In our last experiment, we\nconsider the target object illustrated in Figure 6.3(a). It is characterized by \u03a9 =\nD \u00d7 (0, h0 ), h0 = 0.5, with \u2202D parametrized by\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3\ncos \u03c6\n\u2212(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0)6\n+\n0.75e\n+\n0.6\ncos\n\u03c6\nsin(\u22122\u03c6)\n.\n\u03b3(\u03c6) =\nsin \u03c6\n(1.52 cos2 \u03c6 + 22 sin2 \u03c6)1/2\nThe corresponding admittivity distribution, which is homogeneous in the vertical\ndirection, consists of a homogeneous unit background and two embedded inclusions\n\n(a) Phantom.\n\n(b) Incorrect geometry.\n\n(c) Correct geometry.\n\n(d) Simultaneous retrieval.\n\nFig. 6.3: Experiment with a complicated target shape and a piecewise constant\nadmittivity; each image represents a cross-section of the corresponding phantom/reconstruction that is (almost) homogeneous in the vertical direction.

STABOULIS\n\nwith the constant admittivity level 10. The target electrodes are of equal width, they\ncover two fifths of \u2202D and their locations are chosen as in the previous examples.\nIn this case we consider \u03a6 of (5.6) as a function of (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b8) \u2208 RK \u00d7RN \u00d7RM , with\nN = 15, M = 16 and K being the number of nodes in the mesh for the background\ncylinder \u03a3 = B \u00d7 (0, h0 ). Here, B is once again a disk of radius 3 centered at the\norigin. We assume the same prior information as in the previous example: \u0393\u03b1 is as\nin (5.5) with a = 0.1, s = 1 and \u0393\u03b8 = \u03c4 2 I with \u03c4 = 2\u03c0/M . The initial guesses for\nthe iterative reconstruction algorithm of Section 5.3 are \u03b1(0) = [1.5, 0, . . . , 0]T and\n(0)\n\u03b8m = 2\u03c0(m \u2212 1)/M , m = 1, . . . , M \u2212 1.\nThe results are illustrated in Figure 6.3, with the subimages organized as in\nFigure 6.2 of the previous section. The reconstruction shown in Figure 6.3(b) was\nobtained by ignoring the incompleteness of the information on the geometry, i.e., applying the second stage of the reconstruction algorithm with respect to \u03c3 when the\nsecond line of (5.6) is deleted and (\u03b1, \u03b8) = (\u03b1(0) , \u03b8(0) ) is fixed. Figure 6.3(c) corresponds to the precise knowledge of the measurement setting, i.e., again ignoring the\nsecond line of (5.6), but fixing (\u03b1, \u03b8) = (\u03b2, \u03b8) to be the parameter values describing\nthe target configuration. Finally, the reconstruction in Figure 6.3(d) visualizes simultaneous retrieval of the admittivity distribution and the measurement geometry by\nthe whole two-stage algorithm of Section 5.3.\nThe conclusions about the functionality of the different approaches are the same as\nin the previous experiment: The simultaneous retrieval of the admittivity distribution\nand the measurement geometry provides a reconstruction that is comparable to the\ncase that the object shape and electrode locations are known accurately. On the\nother hand, ignoring the uncertainties in the measurement configuration gives a poor\noutcome.\n7. Concluding remarks. We have presented the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of the measurement map of practical EIT with respect to the (exterior) object boundary shape\nas a part of the solution to a certain elliptic boundary value problem. Through\nthree-dimensional numerical studies based on simulated data, we have demonstrated\nthat utilizing such a geometric derivative, the estimation of the object shape and\nthe electrode locations can be incorporated into a Newton-type output least squares\nreconstruction algorithm in the framework on the CEM of EIT.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
