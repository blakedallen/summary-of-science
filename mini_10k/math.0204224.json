A nilpotent linear\nmap N : V \u2192 V is said to fix a flag F = {F0 \u2282 F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn\u22121 \u2282 V }\nif N Fi \u2286 Fi\u22121 for each i. The variety BN of all flags in the flag manifold\nF l(V ) fixed by a nilpotent map N is a Springer fiber. Such varieties arise\nas fibers of Springer's resolution of singularities of the nilpotent cone of a\nreductive algebraic group G.\nSpringer[25] discovered a method of constructing irreducible representations of Weyl groups on the top homology of BN . For each irreducible\nrepresentation, his construction yields a distinguished basis given by homology classes of the components of the Springer fiber BN . However, since\ntheir mere existence yields the distinguished basis, it seems that efforts to\nunderstand them have not focused on computations of their internal topological structure or that of their intersections. Only a few papers (such\nas Spaltenstein[24], Vargas[28], Wolper[30], Lorist[21], G\u00fcemes[14]) have\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nstudied the topology of the components of the Springer fibers BN and their\nintersections. We extend some of these results to describe the homological\nstructure of components of BN and their pairwise intersections for certain\ntypes of nilpotent maps N (those corresponding to hook and two-row shape\npartitions). In these cases, the components are nonsingular, and in fact are\niterated bundles of flag manifolds and Grassmannians. For more general\nnilpotent maps N , the components can be singular (see Vargas[28] and\nSpaltenstein[24]) and much more complicated.\nWe also relate our computations to the structure of the Kazhdan-Lusztig\nbases of certain representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type A. The\ninner products of these basis vectors, suitably normalized, are polynomials in t and t\u22121 that are invariant under the map t \u2192 t\u22121 . We show\nthat for irreducible representations labeled by a hook or two-row shape,\nthe (suitably normalized) inner products equal the intersection homology\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomials of pairwise intersections of irreducible components\nof Springer fibers of the general linear group. We believe it would be very\ninteresting to understand how our results might generalize to bases of other\nKazhdan-Lusztig representations of type A.\n2. SOME PROPERTIES OF NILPOTENT MAPS AND\nSPRINGER FIBERS\nWe record some properties of nilpotent maps and of the space of all flags\nBN fixed by a nilpotent map N , which is called the Springer fiber of N .\nA theorem of Vargas and Spaltenstein [28] [24] decomposes the space BN\ninto a disjoint union of locally closed subspaces, whose closures are the\nirreducible components of the space BN .\nLet N : V \u2192 V be a nilpotent map of a vector space V over C. Let b be\nthe least positive integer for which N b = 0. Then we have two filtrations of\nsubspaces on V : the image filtration im N b = 0 \u2282 im N b\u22121 \u2282 im N b\u22122 \u2282\n* * * \u2282 im N 1 \u2282 V = im N 0 and the kernel filtration ker N 0 = 0 \u2282 ker N \u2282\nker N 2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 ker N b\u22121 \u2282 V = ker N b (with proper inclusions).\n\nLemma 2.1. For a nilpotent map N , we have N \u22121 (im N k ) = ker N +\n\nim N k\u22121 .\n\nProof. If N (v) \u2208 im N k then N (v) = N k (w) so N (v \u2212 N k\u22121 w) = 0.\nNote that if im N k\u22121 contains ker N then N \u22121 (im N k ) = im N k\u22121 ;\notherwise N \u22121 (im N k ) is strictly larger. Also note that N (ker N i+1 ) \u2286\nim N \u2229 ker N i .\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n3\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let Fi be a subspace of V that is taken into itself by\nthe map N . Then there is a map Ni : V /Fi \u2192 V /Fi induced by N . We\ncall the map Ni a quotient map of N .\n\nLemma 2.2. The image im Ni of the quotient map Ni : V /Fi \u2192 V /Fi\nis equal to (im N + Fi )/Fi . Similarly, (im N k + Fi )/Fi = im Nik .\n\nProof. If N (v) \u2208 im N then N (v) + Fi \u2208 im Ni . On the other hand, if\nw+Fi \u2208 im Ni then the coset w+Fi equals the coset N (v)+Fi for some v \u2208\nV , so w + Fi is clearly in im N + Fi . Then a subspace of V that contains Fi\nand whose projection to V /Fi is im Ni must be im N + Fi . The same holds\ntrue for the nilpotent map N k .\nLemma 2.3. The kernel of the quotient map ker Ni equals N \u22121 (Fi ).\n\nProof. The kernel ker Ni is given by those vectors whose image under Ni\nis 0 + Fi , which is exactly N \u22121 (Fi ).\nLemma 2.4. We have the containment ker N \u2287 im N b\u22121 , but ker N 6\u2287\n\nim N b\u2212j for j > 1.\nProof. This is obvious from definition of b.\nLemma 2.5. If j is the largest integer for which im N j is not contained\n\nin Fi , then j is the largest integer for which (im N j + Fi )/Fi is a nonzero\nimage of the quotient map Ni .\nProof. Suppose v \u2208 im N j but is not in Fi . Then v + Fi is not zero in\nV /Fi , so (im N j + Fi )/Fi is a nonzero image of Ni . Similarly, if v + Fi is a\nnonzero element of (im N j +Fi )/Fi , then there exists an element 0 6= w \u2208 V\nwith w \u2208 im N j and w \u2208 v + Fi .\nNow we discuss the Springer fiber BN of N , which is the variety of flags\nfixed by the nilpotent element N . The ranks of the Jordan blocks of the\nnilpotent map N determine a partition of n. We form a Young shape from\nthis partition by using this partition as the lengths of the rows (opposite\nto the conventions of Vargas[28]). Let the number of columns of the Young\nshape be b; then N b = 0 and N b\u22121 6= 0.\n\n\f4\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nDefinition 2.2.\nGiven a flag F with subspaces {0} = F0 \u2286 F1 \u2286\n* * * \u2286 Fn = V , we say that N fixes F if N Fi is contained in Fi\u22121 for all i.\n\nDefinition 2.3.\nWe denote by BN the set of all flags fixed by N ,\nand call it the Springer fiber of N . It is an algebraic subvariety of the flag\nmanifold B.\n\nRecall that Young shape on n boxes is a collection of n boxes arranged\nin left justified rows of lengths t1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 tk . A standard tableau (or Young\ntableau) on a Young shape \u03c4 is constructed by filling in the n boxes with the\nnumbers 1, . . . , n such that the numbers are decreasing from left to right\nin each row, and decreasing from top to bottom in each column. Note that\nmany authors use increasing rows and columns. We typically use A and B\nto denote standard Young tableaux. Denote by Ai the tableau obtained by\ndeleting the numbers 1, . . . , i in the tableau A and subtracting i from the\nremaining numbers.\nThe following theorem of Vargas and Spaltenstein gives a decomposition\nof the Springer fiber BN into a disjoint union of locally closed subsets,\nwhose closures comprise the irreducible components of BN .\nTheorem 2.1. (Vargas[28], Spaltenstein[24]) Let N be a nilpotent map.\nThen given a standard tableau A on the Young shape of N , we construct a\nlocally closed subset SV (A) of the Springer fiber BN , whose closure SV (A)\nis an irreducible component of BN . We have a partition BN = \u222aA SV (A)\nof the Springer fiber into disjoint locally closed subsets. Thus the number\nof irreducible components of BN is equal to the number of standard tableaux\non the Young shape of N . In addition, the components are all of the same\ndimension. In fact, if the lengths of the columns of the Young shape of N\nare n1 , n2 , . . . , nb , then the dimension of each component is\n\nX ni (ni \u2212 1)\ni\n\n2\n\n.\n\nProof. Suppose A is a Young tableau on the Young shape of N . Then\nwe inductively specify a subset of BN corresponding to A, which we denote\nSV (A) (for Spaltenstein-Vargas), by describing how to choose F1 , then\nF2 /F1 , and so forth. A flag F is in the the subset SV (A) if each subspace\nof F satisfies the following conditions.\nSuppose the number i appears in the c(i)-th column in A. Then (recalling that F0 = 0) the first subspace F1 must satisfy F1 \u2282 (N \u22121 (F0 ) \u2229\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n5\n\n(im N c(1)\u22121 \u2212 im N c(1) ). In other words, F1 must be in the kernel of N ,\nand it must be in the (c(1) \u2212 1)st image of N but not in any higher image.\nThen, for any F1 satisfying the above condition, the induced map N1 :\nV /F1 \u2192 V /F1 will have the same Young shape; this shape is the shape\nobtained by deleting the number 1 in the tableau A.\nWe now choose F2 /F1 \u2282 V /F1 , using the above procedure with N1 in\nplace of N and A1 in place of A. Note that N1\u22121 (0+F1 ) = N \u22121 (F1 )/F1 . We\ncontinue inductively, choosing Fi+1 /Fi so that Fi+1 /Fi \u2282 (N \u22121 (Fi )/Fi ) \u2229\nc(i)\nc(i)\u22121\n\u2212im Ni ). Note that any such choice of Fi+1 yields a quotient\n(im Ni\nmap Ni+1 with Young shape Ai+1 .\nSee Vargas[28] and Spaltenstein[24] for the proof that this constructs a\nlocally closed subset of BN with the properties claimed in the theorem.\nThe proof is essentially an explicit calculation with the Jordan form of N .\nVargas([28], Proposition 2.2) shows that this set SV (A) is exactly the\nset of flags such that\nFi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 )\nFi \u2282 Fi\u22121 + im N c(i)\u22121 .\n\n3. DETERMINATION OF THE TOPOLOGY OF THE\nIRREDUCIBLE COMPONENTS OF SPRINGER FIBERS\nFOR NILPOTENT MAPS OF HOOK TYPE FOR GLN (C).\nSuppose N is a nilpotent map V \u2192 V whose Jordan form has at most\none Jordan block of rank > 1. Then N is said to be of hook type. For\nhook type nilpotent maps N , we can characterize the components of the\nSpringer fiber BN entirely in terms of the image and kernel filtrations of V .\nThe components and their intersections will turn out to be nonsingular. In\nfact their homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials factor as products of Poincar\u00e9\npolynomials of Grassmannians and flag manifolds.\nWe will describe each component of the Springer fiber of a nilpotent map\nN of hook type by expressing the component as a sequence of fiber bundles\nwith progressively simpler bases and fibers.\nDefinition 3.1.\nA space X1 is an iterated fiber bundle of base type\n(B1 , . . . , Bn ) if there exist spaces X1 , B1 , X2 , B2 , . . . , Xn , Bn , Xn+1 = pt\nand maps p1 , p2 , . . . , pn such that pj : Xj \u2192 Bj is a fiber bundle with\ntypical fiber Xj+1 .\n\nThe following two lemmas are straightforward.\n\n\f6\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nLemma 3.1. : The flag manifold F l(V ) admits a map to the Grassmannian Gi (V ) via F 7\u2192 Fi . The fiber of this map is a product F l(Fi ) \u00d7\nF l(V /Fi ).\n\nLemma 3.2. Consider the variety of flags X(I, K) in an n-dimensional\nvector space V such that Fi contains an a-dimensional subspace I and is\ncontained in a b-dimensional subspace K. This variety X(I, K) admits a\nmap p : X(I, K) \u2192 Gi\u2212a (K/I) via F 7\u2192 Fi /I \u2282 K/I that makes X(I, K)\nthe total space of a fiber bundle. The typical fiber of the map p is a product\nF l(Fi ) \u00d7 F l(V /Fi ). In particular, the variety X(I, K) is nonsingular.\n\nWe define some notation to simplify our intersection homology computations. Define [n] by\n[n] := t\u2212(n\u22121) (1 + t2 + t4 + * * * + t2(n\u22121) ).\nThen we define\n\u0012 \u0013\n[n]!\n[n]\n[n]! := [1][2] . . . [n] and\n:=\n.\n[k]![n \u2212 k]!\n[k]\nThe polynomial [n] is essentially the t-analogue of the number n, but\nshifted to be symmetric around the degree 0 term. Thus the flag manifold\nF l(V ) has intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial [n]! and Gk (V ) has\n\u0001\nintersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial [n]\n.\n[k]\nCorollary 3.1. Let X(I) be the variety of flags in F l(V ) such that\nthe the subspace Fi contains an a-dimensional subspace I. Then X(I) has\n\u0001\nintersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial [n\u2212a]\n[i]![n \u2212 i]!.\n[i\u2212a]\n\nProof. Clear from Lemma 3.2, since complex flag manifolds and complex\nGrassmannians have only even-dimensional homology so the Leray-Serre\nspectral sequence for p : X(I) \u2192 Gi\u2212a (V /I) with fiber F l(Fi ) \u00d7 F l(V /Fi )\ncollapses.\nLemma 3.3. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type with Jordan blocks of\nsize (b, 1, . . . , 1). Then for all 0 < i < b, we have im N b\u2212i = ker N i \u2229 im N ,\nwhich implies N (ker N i+1 ) \u2282 im N b\u2212i .\n\nProof. This follows from inspection of the Jordan form of N .\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n7\n\nWe now decompose each component of the Springer fiber BN for a hook\ntype nilpotent map N as an iterated bundle with nonsingular bases and\nfibers. Recall that the number b is the least positive integer with N b = 0.\nb(i)\nLet b(i) be the least positive integer with Ni = 0.\nTheorem 3.1. Suppose we are given a nilpotent map N of hook type\nand a Young tableau A on the Young shape of N with n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 on\nthe top row (where by convention ib = n and i0 = 0). Then the component KA of the Springer fiber BN is an iterated bundle with B2j\u22121 =\nb(i )\u22121\nGij \u2212ij\u22121 \u22121 (ker Nij / im Nij j ) and B2j = F l(Fij /Fij\u22121 ), where j = 1, 2, . . . , b\u2212\n1, and B2b\u22121 is a full flag manifold F l(V /Fib\u22121 ).\n\nThe proof will be broken up into a series of lemmas and propositions.\nProposition 3.1. (Vargas[28]) Suppose we are given a nilpotent map\nN of hook type and a Young tableau A on the Young shape of N with\nn, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 on the top row. Then the component KA = SV (A) of the\nSpringer fiber BN consists of all flags F in F l(V ) such that\n\nim N b\u22121 \u2286 Fi1 \u2286 ker N\nim N b\u22122 \u2286 Fi2 \u2286 ker N 2\nim N b\u22123 \u2286 Fi3 \u2286 ker N 3\n...\nim N 1 \u2286 Fib\u22121 \u2286 ker N b\u22121 .\n\nProof. This is Vargas[28], Theorem 4.1. The proof consists of an explicit\nlimiting argument using the structure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset\nSV (A).\nLemma 3.4. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type, and let Fi1 be a\nsubspace of V with N Fi1 \u2282 Fi1 and im N b\u22121 \u2282 Fi1 \u2282 ker N . Then we\nhave\n\nker Nid1 = ker N d+1 /Fi1\nim Nid1 = (im N d + Fi1 )/Fi1 .\n\nProof. We describe ker Nid1 \u2286 V /Fi as follows. If v \u2208 ker N d+1 then\nN d (v) \u2208 im N \u2229 ker N = im N b\u22121 . Since im N b\u22121 \u2286 Fi1 , we have N d (v) \u2208\n\n\f8\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nFi1 , so v + Fi1 \u2208 ker Nid1 . On the other hand, if Nid1 (v + Fi1 ) = 0 + Fi1 then\nN d (v) \u2208 Fi1 . Now by Lemma 3.3, the subspace Fi1 contains im N b\u22121 but\nno other element of im N . Thus N d+1 (v) = 0, and so v \u2208 ker N d+1 . Thus\nif a subspace W \u2282 V contains Fi1 then W/Fi1 \u2286 ker Nid1 iff W \u2286 ker N d+1 .\nBy Lemma 2.2 im (N d +Fi1 )/Fi1 = im Nid1 . Thus if W \u2282 V contains Fi1 ,\nthen W/Fi1 contains im Nid1 iff W contains im N d .\nLemma 3.5. Suppose we are given a nilpotent N of hook type and a\nYoung tableau A on the Young shape of N with n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 on the top row\n(where by convention ib = n and i0 = 0). Then the component KA of the\nSpringer fiber BN admits a map p1 to the Grassmannian Gi1 \u22121 (ker N/ im N b\u22121 ).\nThe fiber X2 of the map p1 : KA \u2192 Gi1 \u22121 (ker N/ im N b\u22121 ) admits a map\np2 : X2 \u2192 F l(Fi1 ). The fiber of p2 can be identified with a component\nof a Springer fiber of the quotient map Ni1 : V /Fi1 \u2192 V /Fi1 , where the\ncomponent is associated to the standard tableau Ai1 .\n\nProof. The existence of the map p1 follows from Lemma 3.2 with I =\nim N b\u22121 (which is a 1-dimensional space) and K = ker N (which is an n \u2212\nb + 1-dimensional space containing im N b\u22121 ). Let B1 be the Grassmannian\nGi1 \u22121 (ker N/ im N b\u22121 ). The fiber X2 of the map p1 : KA \u2192 B1 consists\nof all flags in the component with a fixed subspace Fi1 . We define the map\np2 : X2 \u2192 F l(Fi1 ) by taking F \u2208 X2 and forgetting all subspaces of F\nlarger than Fi1 . By inspecting Proposition 3.1 we see that p2 is surjective\nand indeed a fiber bundle projection.\nThe fiber X3 of this map p2 is the set of all flags in the component KA\nwith fixed subspaces F1 , . . . , Fi1 . Then X3 maps bijectively to a subset of\nF l(V /Fi1 ) via the map F \u2192 F \u2032 , where Fj\u2032 = Fj+i1 /Fi1 . We now show that\nX3 is the component KAi1 of the Springer fiber of the quotient map Ni1\non V /Fi1 , by showing that X3 satisfies the characterization of Proposition\n3.1.\nBy Lemma 3.4, the fiber X3 of p2 is in bijection with the set of flags\nF \u2032 \u2208 F l(V /Fi1 ) such that\nim Nib\u22122\n\u2286 Fi\u20322 \u2212i1 \u2286 ker Ni1\n1\nim Nib\u22123\n\u2286 Fi\u20323 \u2212i1 \u2286 ker Ni21\n1\nim Nib\u22124\n\u2286 Fi\u20323 \u2212i1 \u2286 ker Ni31\n1\n...\n.\nim Ni11 \u2286 Fi\u2032b\u22121 \u2212i1 \u2286 ker Nib\u22122\n1\nThus X3 is the component KAi1 of the Springer fiber BN1 .\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n9\n\nProof. (of Theorem 3.1) A typical fiber X2 of the map p2 : KA \u2192\nF l(Fi1 ) consists of flags F \u2208 KA with fixed subspaces F1 , . . . , Fi1 . This\nfiber X2 is in bijection with the set of flags in V /Fi1 that are fixed by\nNi1 : V /Fi1 \u2192 V /Fi1 .\nSo we have exhibited the component KA = X1 of the Springer fiber BN as\nthe total space of a bundle p1 : X1 \u2192 B1 with base B1 = Gi1 \u22121 (ker N/ im N b\u22121 ).\nThe fiber X2 of p1 is the total space of another bundle p2 : X2 \u2192 B2 with\nbase B2 = F l(V /Fi1 ).\nSuccessive applications of Lemma 3.5 prove that if X2j+1 is a component\nof the Springer fiber of Nij : V /Fij \u2192 V /Fij , then X2j+3 is the corresponding component of the Springer fiber for Nij+1 : V /Fij+1 \u2192 V /Fij+1 .\nFinally, since im N \u2282 Fib\u22121 , we see that the map Nib\u22121 : V /Fib\u22121 \u2192\nV /Fib\u22121 is the zero map. Thus the (unique) component of the Springer\nfiber for Nib\u22121 (which is X2b\u22121 ) is the flag manifold F l(V /Fib\u22121 ).\nTheorem 3.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type, and let A be\na standard tableau on the hook shape of N , with top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 .\nThen the component KA of the Springer fiber BN has intersection homology\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial equal to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n[n \u2212 b]\n[(n \u2212 i1 ) \u2212 (b \u2212 1)]\n[(n \u2212 ib\u22122 \u2212 2]\n[i1 ]!\n[i2 \u2212 i1 ]!\n. . . [ib\u22121 \u2212 ib\u22122 ]!\n[n \u2212 ib\u22121 ]!.\n[i1 \u2212 1]\n[i2 \u2212 i1 \u2212 1]\n[ib\u22121 \u2212 ib\u22122 \u2212 1]\n\nThis polynomial equals\n[n \u2212 b]![i1 ][i2 \u2212 i1 ][i3 \u2212 i2 ] . . . [ib\u22121 \u2212 ib\u22122 ][n \u2212 ib\u22121 ].\n\nProof.\nWe have already proven that the component in question is an iterated\nfiber bundle with B2j a complex flag manifold, with B2j\u22121 a complex\nGrassmannian for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 b \u2212 1, and with X2b\u22121 = B2b\u22121 a complex\nflag manifold. So the bundle p2b\u22122 : X2b\u22122 \u2192 B2b\u22122 with fiber X2b\u22121\nhas only even-dimensional homology in base and fiber. Therefore the\nLeray-Serre spectral sequence for p2b\u22122 collapses and the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of X2b\u22122 is the product of those for X2b\u22121 and B2b\u22122 ; in particular,\nX2b\u22121 has only even-dimensional homology. Then we do the same for\np2b\u22123 : X2b\u22123 \u2192 B2b\u22123 with fiber X2b\u22122 ; since B2b\u22123 is a complex Grassmannian, the space X2b\u22123 also has only even-dimensional homology. So\nX2b\u22123 , X2b\u22125 , . . . have only even-dimensional homology and their homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials are products of Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of flag manifolds and Grassmannians. This recursion thus unravels to give us the homology of X1 as stated above. Finally, since the space X1 is nonsingular, we\n\n\f10\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nneed only shift the homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial until it is invariant under\nt 7\u2192 t\u22121 , in order to obtain the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial.\nRemark 3. 1. We have proven that the closed subvariety of BN associated by Vargas' description to the tableau A is irreducible because this subvariety is a bundle of irreducible varieties; it also contains a SpaltensteinVargas set SV (A); hence it must be exactly the closure KA of the SpaltensteinVargas set SV (A). This is an alternative proof that Vargas' descriptions\nindeed yield the components of the Springer fiber BN .\n\n4. STRUCTURE OF INTERSECTIONS OF TWO\nCOMPONENTS OF HOOK TYPE\nTheorem 4.1. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type. Suppose we\nhave two standard tableaux A and B on the Young shape of N , where the\nstandard tableau A has top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 and the standard tableau B\nhas top row n, i\u2032b\u22121 , . . . , i\u20321 . Then the intersection of the two components\nKA \u2229 KB is nonempty iff \u03b2j = max{ij , i\u2032j } < min{ij+1 , i\u2032j+1 } = \u03b1j+1 , in\nwhich case KA \u2229 KB is an iterated fiber bundle with\nb(\u03b2j )\n\nB2j\u22121 = G\u03b2j \u2212\u03b2j\u22121 \u22121 (ker N\u03b2j / im N\u03b2j\n\n)\n\nB2j = {F \u2208 F l(F\u03b2j /F\u03b2j\u22121 ) | im Njb\u2212j\u22121 \u2208 F\u03b1j \u2212\u03b2j\u22121 }.\n\nProof.\nWe proceed as in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Let \u03b1j = min{ij , i\u2032j } and\n\u03b2j = max{ij , i\u2032j }. By superimposing the characterizations of the components KA and KB , we deduce that the intersection KA \u2229 KB is given by\nthose flags F in F l(V ) for which\nim N b\u22121 \u2286 F\u03b11 \u2286 F\u03b21 \u2286 ker N\nim N b\u22122 \u2286 F\u03b12 \u2286 F\u03b22 \u2286 ker N 2\nim N b\u22123 \u2286 F\u03b13 \u2286 F\u03b23 \u2286 ker N 3\n...\nim N 1 \u2286 F\u03b1b\u22121 \u2286 F\u03b2b\u22121 \u2286 ker N b\u22121 .\nIf there exists j for which max{ij , i\u2032j } \u2265 min{ij+1 , i\u2032j+1 } then the flag\nFmax{ij ,i\u2032j } would have to contain im N b\u2212j\u22121 yet be contained in ker N j ,\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n11\n\nwhich is impossible by Lemma 3.3. This proves the emptiness assertion of\nthe lemma.\nNow we exhibit the intersection KA \u2229 KB = X1 as an iterated bundle.\nDefine a map p1 : X1 \u2192 B1 = G\u03b21 \u22121 (ker N/ im N b\u22121 ) by F 7\u2192 F\u03b21 . The\ntypical fiber X2 of the map p1 consists of all flags F with a fixed F\u03b21 such\nthat F\u03b11 contains the 1-dimensional space im N b\u22121 . Then there is a map\ntaking X2 to the space B2 , which consists of all flags inside F\u03b21 such that\nF\u03b11 contains im N b\u22121 , given by F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn 7\u2192 F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 * * * \u2282\nF\u03b21 . We described the structure and homology of the space B2 in lemma\n3.2 above.\nThen the fiber of the map p2 : X2 \u2192 B2 is in bijection with a certain space of flags in V /F\u03b21 satisfying (as in the previous theorem) a list\nof conditions with respect to the quotient map N\u03b21 : V /F\u03b21 \u2192 V /F\u03b21 .\nAs before, these conditions are exactly the ones that specify the intersection of two components of the Springer fiber for N\u03b21 whose tableaux A\u03b21\nand B\u03b21 have top rows n \u2212 \u03b21 , ib\u22121 \u2212 \u03b21 , . . . , i2 \u2212 \u03b21 and n \u2212 \u03b21 , i\u2032b\u22121 \u2212\n\u03b21 , . . . , i\u20322 \u2212 \u03b21 respectively. Thus by descending induction we have our result.\nCorollary 4.1.

DETERMINATION OF THE TOPOLOGY OF\nCOMPONENTS OF SPRINGER FIBERS FOR NILPOTENT\nMAPS OF TWO-ROW TYPE FOR GLN (C)\nIn this section we study the Springer fibers of nilpotent maps N whose\nYoung shapes have at most two rows. Thus N has at most two Jordan\nblocks. We will find that the components are iterated bundles with CP1 as\n\n\f12\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nbase spaces, and we will relate the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of their pairwise intersections to the inner products of the KazhdanLusztig basis. In doing so, we will extend some results of Lorist[21] on the\ntopology of the components of two-row shapes with two boxes in the lower\nrow.\nLet N : V \u2192 V be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Recall that a flag\nF with subspaces 0 = F0 \u2282 F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn = V is fixed by N if for all\ni, we have N Fi \u2286 Fi\u22121 . Recall that b is defined to be the least positive\ninteger with N b = 0. Similarly let b(i) be the least positive integer such\nb(i)\nthat Ni = 0.\nDefinition 5.1.\nSuppose Ni : V /Fi \u2192 V /Fi is a quotient map of a\nnilpotent map N . Suppose that the subspace Fj /Fi contains im Nik but\nnot im Nik\u22121 . Then we call im Nik the lowest image contained in Fj /Fi\nand we denote this lowest image im Nik by Lowimi (Fj ). (Note that the\nimage of a higher power of Ni is a smaller subspace of V /Fi .) Similarly, we\ndenote the lowest image of N that is not contained in Fj by Lowim(Fj ).\n\nLemma 5.1. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Let Fi be a\nsubspace of V such that Fi \u2286 im N and N Fi \u2282 Fi . Then the quotient\nspace N \u22121 (Fi )/Fi is 2-dimensional.\n\nProof. Since N Fi \u2282 Fi , we see that indeed Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi ). Then the\ndimensionality of N \u22121 (Fi )/Fi is clear from the Jordan form of the map N ,\nsince Fi \u2286 im N .\nLemma 5.2. Suppose N is a nilpotent map corresponding to a tworow Young shape \u03c4 . Let A be a standard tableau of shape \u03c4 with top\nrow n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 . Then every flag F in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset\nSV (A) defined in 2 satisfies the following conditions: Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and\nim N b\u2212j \u2286 Fij .\n\nProof. Let the flag F be in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A).\nThen by construction of SV (A), every subspace clearly satisfies the first\ncondition.\nNow we prove the second condition by inspecting the procedure used to\nspecify the flag subspaces of F . Recall that if i is in the c(i)-th column of\nc(i)\nc(i)\u22121\nA, then Fi /Fi\u22121 must lie in ker Ni\u22121 \u2229 (im Ni\u22121 \u2212 im Ni\u22121 ).\nNow we show that if i is on the bottom row of A then, for any flag\nF in SV (A), Lowim(Fi ) = Lowim(Fi\u22121 ); in other words, the subspace\nFi will never contain a lower image than Fi\u22121 contains. There are two\n\n\f13\n\nTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\nb\n\n\u22121\n\ni\u22121\nof Ni\u22121 is\ncases. First suppose the highest non-zero image im Ni\u22121\nbi\u22121 \u22121\n2- dimensional. Then Fi /Fi\u22121 cannot exhaust im Ni\u22121 . On the other\nbi\u22121 \u22121\nis 1-dimensional, then since the\nhand, if the highest image im Ni\u22121\nnumber i is not on the top row of the tableau A, the subspace Fi /Fi\u22121\nbi\u22121 \u22121\n.\nmust not equal im Ni\u22121\nNow note that F1 , . . . , Fi1 \u22121 do not contain wholly any image of N . To\nstress our line of argument, note that these subspaces contain the same\nimage of N as F0 = {0} does. Therefore im Nib\u22121\n6= 0. Then by construc1 \u22121\nb\u22121\ntion, Fi1 /Fi1 \u22121 must contain im Ni1 \u22121 . Since Fi1 also contains Fi1 \u22121 , we\nsee by Lemma 2.2 that Fi1 must contain im N b\u22121 .\nSimilarly, Fij , . . . , Fij+1 \u22121 all contain im N b\u2212j and no lower image of N ,\nbecause each of these subspaces is constructed not to contain the highest image of the previous quotient map; and, as before, Fij+1 must contain\nim N b\u2212j\u22121 . Thus the lemma is proved.\n\nRemark 5. 1. Note that the conditions of the lemma are closed and so\nare satisfied by the closure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A), which\nis the entire component KA of the Springer fiber BN .\n\nTheorem 5.1. Suppose that N is a nilpotent map of two-row type and\nthat A is a standard tableau on the Young shape of N , with top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 .\nFor any i between 1 and n, denote by T (i) and B(i) the lengths of the top\nand bottom rows of the tableau obtained from A by deleting 1, . . . , i. Suppose the flag F is contained in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Then\nthe subspace Fi contains im N T (i) and is contained in im N B(i) .\n\nProof. The assertion about T (i) is proven above. As to the assertion\nabout B(i), we proceed by induction on i. First note that F1 is contained\nin N \u22121 (F0 ) and therefore must be contained in the lowest image which has\nnontrivial intersection with the kernel. By inspecting the Jordan form of\nN we see that this image is exactly im N B(1) .\nNow suppose Fi is contained in im N B(i) . Then there are two possibilities for Fi+1 . If i + 1 is on the bottom, then Fi+1 is within N \u22121 (Fi ) \u2286\nN \u22121 (im N B(i) ). Now by the Jordan form, we see that B(i) cannot be\ngreater than the power of the lowest image that contains ker N , so im N B(i)\ncontains ker N . Thus, by lemma 2.1,\nN \u22121 (im N B(i) ) = im N B(i)\u22121 = im N B(i+1) .\n\n\f14\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nNow if i + 1 is on the top row of the tableau A, then by Theorem 2.1,\nFi+1 /Fi is equal to (im N T (i+1) + Fi )/Fi . Since T (i + 1) \u2265 B(i), the subspace Fi+1 is still contained in im N B(i) .\nTheorem 5.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type, and let A\nbe a standard tableau on the Young shape of A with top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , i1 .\nThen the component KA of the Springer fiber BN consists of all flags whose\nsubspaces satisfy the following conditions:\n\nFi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) for each i, and\nif i is on the top row of the tableau A and i \u2212 1 is on the bottom row, then\nFi = N \u22121 (Fi\u22122 );\nif i and i \u2212 1 are both in the top row of A, then if Fi\u22121 = N \u2212d (Fr ) where\nr is on the bottom row then\nFi = N \u2212d\u22121 (Fr\u22121 )\nand if Fi\u22121 = N \u2212d (im N b\u2212i ) where 0 \u2264 i < n \u2212 b then\nFi = N \u2212d (im N b\u2212i\u22121 ).\nThe subspaces that are specified as inverse images of other spaces will\nbe called dependent; note that they are exactly the subspaces whose indices are on the top row of the tableau A. The other subspaces are called\nindependent.\nProof. Denote by K(A) the closed subset of flags that satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Note that K(A) \u2286 BN . Let F be a flag in the\nSpaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Then we prove by induction on i that\neach subspace Fi of F satisfies the above conditions, so that the flag F lies\nin K(A). Then we will show below that the closed subset of the theorem\nis in fact irreducible and of the same dimension as the (nonempty) subset\nSV (A). Thus K(A) is exactly the closure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset\nSV (A) and is thus the component KA of the Springer fiber BN .\nFirst we settle the i = 1 case. Suppose that the number 1 is in the\nbottom row of A. Then for all F in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A),\nit is the case that F1 must be in ker N , which is exactly N \u22121 (F0 ). If 1 is\nin the top row then F1 must equal the highest image im N b\u22121 ; note that\nF0 = 0 = N \u22120 (im N b ) so F1 = N \u22120 (im N b\u22121 ). Also note that the highest\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n15\n\nimage must indeed be 1-dimensional in order for 1 to be in the top row.\nThis settles the i = 1 case.\nNow suppose that F1 , . . . , Fi satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Now\nthe number i + 1 is either on the bottom row of the tableau A, or on the\ntop row of A. If i + 1 is on the bottom row of A, then the SpaltensteinVargas procedure requires only that Fi+1 /Fi be contained in ker Ni , which\nby lemma 2.3 equals N \u22121 (Fi ).\nNow suppose i + 1 is on the top row of the tableau A. Then the number\ni is either on the bottom row of A or on the top row. First we will prove\nthat if i is on the bottom row, then Fi+1 = N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ).\nRecall that Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ), and Fi+1 /Fi must be the 1-dimensional\nsubspace of V /Fi which is the highest nonzero image of Ni . (Since i was\non the bottom row, it is clear that the tableau obtained by deleting 1, . . . , i\nis not rectangular so the highest image of Ni is not 2-dimensional.)\n\u22121\nSo Fi is in N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) = Ni\u22121\n(0 + Fi\u22121 ) and by construction Fi /Fi\u22121\ncannot be all of the highest nonzero image of Ni\u22121 . Therefore there must\nbe other vectors v \u2208 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) such that v + Fi 6= 0 + Fi , and also v + Fi\u22121\nis in the highest image of Ni\u22121 , hence v is in the highest image of N which\nis in not in Fi\u22121 . Then any such v must be in the highest image of N which\nis not contained in Fi . Since N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 )/Fi is 1-dimensional, this proves\nthat N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 )/Fi must be the highest image of Ni : V /Fi \u2192 V /Fi .\nThus we have proven that if i is in the bottom row and i + 1 is in the\ntop row, then Fi+1 = N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ).\nNow suppose i + 1 is on the top row, and i is also on the top row. Then\nby induction either Fi = N \u2212d (Fr ) where r is on the bottom row, or else\nFi = N \u2212d (im N a ) (where n \u2212 b < a \u2264 b). If r is on the bottom row then,\nby Theorem 5.1, the lowest image that Fr contains is exactly the same\nas the lowest image that Fr\u22121 contains. Therefore N \u22121 (Fr\u22121 ) contains\none lower image and is of dimension exactly one larger than that of Fr .\nThus N \u2212d\u22121 (Fr\u22121 ) contains exactly one lower image and is of one larger\ndimension than N \u2212d (Fr ).\nOtherwise Fi = N \u2212d (im N a ) for some a > n \u2212 b. Since a > n \u2212 b,\nthe dimension of im N a\u22121 is exactly one larger than the dimension of\nim N a . Thus N \u2212d (im N a\u22121 ) contains one lower image and is one dimension larger than im N a . So N \u2212d (im N a\u22121 )/Fi equals the highest nonzero\nb(i)\nimage im Ni and so Fi+1 = N \u2212d (im N a\u22121 ). Finally, we prove below that\nK(A) = SV (A) = KA .\nProposition 5.1. The closed subset K(A) is irreducible, and K(A) is\nan iterated bundle of base type (CP1 , . . . , CP1 , where there are as many\nterms as there are number in the bottom row of the tableau A.\n\n\f16\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nProof. Suppose that the shape of N has exactly two rows (if it has\nonly one row, then KA is a point). Let F be a flag in the component\nKA of the Springer fiber BN . Suppose Fj1 is the smallest independent\nsubspace of the flag F . Then Fj1 \u22121 is some fixed subspace of V (necessarily in im N ), and Fj1 /Fj1 \u22121 can be any point in the fixed space\nP(N \u22121 (Fj1 \u22121 )/Fj1 \u22121 ) = CP1 . Set B1 = N \u22121 (Fj1 \u22121 )/Fj1 \u22121 . The map\np1 : KA \u2192 B1 given by F 7\u2192 Fj1 /Fj1 \u22121 is then a fiber bundle (it is clearly\na proper submersion). The typical fiber X2 of the map p1 consists of all\nflags F in KA with the subspace Fi fixed, as well as with all subspaces\nof F that are dependent on Fj1 fixed. Now find the smallest independent\nsubspace Fj2 in X2 . Again, all subspaces smaller then Fj2 are dependent,\nand thus fixed. So we see that Fj2 /Fj2 \u22121 can be any point in the fixed\nspace P(N \u22121 (Fj2 \u22121 )/Fj2 \u22121 ) = B2 , which defines the bundle projection\np2 : X2 \u2192 B2 , with fiber X3 . We continue until all independent subspaces\nare exhausted and the fiber consists of one flag with all subspaces fixed.\nTheorem 5.3. Every component KA of the Springer fiber for a nilpotent\nmap of two-row type is an iterated bundle of base type (CP1 , . . . , CP1 , where\nthere are as many terms as there are numbers in the bottom row of the\ntableau A.\n\nProof. The closed subset K(A) is irreducible, contained in BN , and\nclearly has dimension n \u2212 b, which is the dimension of the nonempty\nSpaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Therefore, by standard algebraic geometry, K(A) must equal the component KA = SV (A).\nExample 5.1.\n\nConsider the standard tableau\n5 4 1\n3 2\n\nThen the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi \u2282\nN \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ), and the conditions F1 = imN 2 and F4 = N \u22121 (F2 ), which we\ncan write compactly as\nim N 2 \u2282 F2 \u2282 F3 \u2282 N \u22121 (F2 ) \u2282 V.\nSimilarly, the standard tableau\n5 3 2\n4 1\ncorresponds to the component\nF1 \u2282 N \u22121 (F0 ) \u2282 N \u22121 (im N 2 ) \u2282 F4 \u2282 V.\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\nExample 5.2.\n\n17\n\nConsider the standard tableau\n5 4 3\n2 1\n\nThen the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi \u2282\nN \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and\nF1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 N \u22121 (F1 ) \u2282 N \u22122 (F0 ) \u2282 V.\nSimilarly, the standard tableau\n5 4 1\n3 2\ncorresponds to the component with Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and\nim N 2 \u2282 F2 \u2282 F3 \u2282 N \u22121 (F2 ) \u2282 V.\nTheir intersection is the set of flags with Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and\nim N 2 < N \u22121 (F0 ) < N \u22121 (im N 2 ) < N \u22122 (F0 ) < V.\nIn particular, the intersection is not empty, in contrast to the assertions of\nWolper[30].\n\nExample 5.3.\n\nConsider the standard tableau\n10 9 8 7 4 3\n6 5 2 1\n\nThen the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi \u2282\nN \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and\nF1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 N \u22121 (F1 ) \u2282 N \u22122 (F0 ) \u2282 F5 \u2282 F6 \u2282\nN \u22121 (F5 ) \u2282 N \u22124 (F0 ) \u2282 N \u22124 (im N 5 ) \u2282 V.\n\nExample 5.4.\nWe show how to recover Lorist's description of the\nstructure of components of Springer fibers of 2-regular nilpotent maps (that\n\n\f18\n\nFRANCIS Y.

There are two types of components KA , corresponding to\nwhether the numbers on the bottom row of A are consecutive (yielding a\nnon-trivial bundle) or not consecutive (yielding a trivial bundle). If the\nnumbers in the bottom rows A are not consecutive, say i < j, then we get\nim N b\u22121 \u2282 im N b\u22122 \u2282 im N b\u2212i+1 \u2282 Fi \u2282 N \u22121 (im N b\u2212i+1 ) \u2282 . . .\n\u2282 N \u22121 (im N b\u2212j+3 ) \u2282 Fj \u2282 N \u22122 (im N b\u2212j+3 ) \u2282 N \u22122 (im N b\u2212j+2 ) \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn .\nIf the numbers are consecutive, say i, i + 1, then we get\nim N b\u22121 \u2282 im N b\u22122 \u2282 im N b\u2212i+1 \u2282 Fi \u2282 Fi+1 \u2282 N \u22121 (Fi ) \u2282 N \u22122 (im N b\u2212i+1 ) \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn .\n\nFinally, we derive the scholium that the \"dependence\" on one subspace\non another can be thought of as symmetric: if Fi = N \u2212d (Fr ) in the above\ntheorem, then indeed Fi also determines Fr ; so given either subspace, we\ncan obtain the other. So \"independent\" can be thought of as \"smallest in\nthe chain of dependencies.\"\nProposition 5.2. Suppose Fi is specified as N \u2212d (Fr ) in Theorem 5.2.\n\nThen the map N d : Fi \u2192 Fr is surjective. Thus the subspace Fi determines\nthe subspace Fr .\nProof. In general, N (N \u22121 (W )) = W \u2229 im N . Thus we need only ensure\nthat if Fi is specified as N \u2212d (Fr ) then in fact Fr \u2286 im N d . First note that\nthe process described in the proof of Theorem 5.2 never takes an inverse\nimage of a subspace Fi unless Fi \u2282 im N . Furthermore, if Fi = N \u2212d (Fr )\nwhere Fr is independent and r > 0, then (for F in SV (A)) the subspace\nFr\u22121 is contained in one higher image of N than Fr . So if N \u2212d+1 (Fr ) \u2282\nim N k , then also N \u2212d (Fr\u22121 ) \u2282 im N k . This last statement holds in the entire component KA . Hence if Fi = N \u2212d (Fr ) then Fr \u2286 im N d , so N d (Fi ) =\nFr .\n\n6. RELATIONSHIP WITH KAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY\nLet W be a Coxeter group with simple reflections S. Denote the ChevalleyBruhat order by <. Recall [18][16] that the Kazhdan-Lusztig construction\n\u2032\nyields elements Cw\nin the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W , which give distinguished bases for certain representations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra,\ncalled left cell representations, which are associated to certain subsets C of\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n19\n\nW called left cells. In particular, this construction yields a distinguished\nbasis for each irreducible representation of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn\nof the symmetric group Sn .\nNow recall [7][22] that every irreducible representation M of the IwahoriHecke algebra Hn possesses a unique (up to a scalar) nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form h , i that is invariant under Hn , in the sense that\nfor any v, v \u2032 \u2208 M , we have hTw v, v \u2032 i = hv, Tw\u2217 v \u2032 i. (Here, the involution\n\u2217\n: Hn \u2192 Hn is defined by sending Tw 7\u2192 Tw\u22121 and then extending linearly.)\nThus we can consider the inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis\nvectors of an irreducible representation with respect to this inner product.\nWe find that they satisfy equations very reminiscent of a possible application of the Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber Decomposition Theorem.\nTo state these relations, first we determine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues\nof the elements Cs\u2032 (for s a simple reflection) acting by left multiplication\non Hn .\nLemma 6.1. The eigenvectors of the map Hn \u2192 Hn given by left multiplication by Cs\u2032 are given by\n\ncw\nwhere sw < w, and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCs\u2032 Cw\n\u2212 (t + t\u22121 )Cw\nwhere sw > w.\n\u2032\nProof. The first follows immediately from the formula for Cs\u2032 Cw\n(see\n[26]). To see the second, we calculate\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCs\u2032 Cs\u2032 Cw\n\u2212 (t + t\u22121 )Cs\u2032 Cw\n= 0.\n\nNow note that these eigenvectors span the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn .\nLemma 6.2. The eigenvectors for Cs\u2032 on a left cell representation MC\n\nare\n\u2032\nCw\nwhere sw < w, and\nCs\u2032 cw \u2212 (t + t\u22121 )cw where sw > w.\n\nProof. Immediate from Lemma 6.1.\nOur equations follow from the following\nLemma 6.3. Let V be a representation of an algebra A. Suppose V is\nequipped with an invariant symmetric bilinear form h , i. Suppose we have\n\n\f20\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nan element a \u2208 A with a = a\u2217 , and let x and y be eigenvectors of a with\ndifferent eigenvalues. Then x and y are orthogonal; i.e. hx, yi = 0.\nProof. Suppose x has eigenvalue \u03bb and y has eigenvalue \u03c1 under a \u2208 A.\nThen hax, yi = \u03bbhx, yi = hx, ayi = \u03c1hx, yi so if \u03bb 6= \u03c1 then hx, yi = 0.\nTheorem 6.1. Let C be a left cell yielding a left cell representation MC .\nLet h , i be an invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on MC .\nLet s be a simple reflection for W . Then for each pair (x, w) with s \u2208 L(x)\nand s 6\u2208 L(w) (so s descends x but not w), we have an equation between\ninner products\n\n(t + t\u22121 )hcx , cw i = hcx , Cs\u2032 cw i.\n\nProof. Given a simple reflection s, we have a large supply of eigenvectors\nfor Cs\u2032 in MC given by Lemma 6.2, namely cx where sx < x and (t+t\u22121 )cw \u2212\nCs\u2032 cw where sw > w. Then for each pair (x, w), we have two eigenvectors of\nCs\u2032 with different eigenvalues, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Therefore\nwe have the equations as claimed.\nIn fact, these equations are equivalent to Hn -invariance:\nProposition 6.1. If a bilinear form on a left cell representation satisfies\nthe equations\n\n(t + t\u22121 )hcx , cw i = hcx , Cs\u2032 cw i\nfor each pair cx , cw where sw > w and sx < x, then the inner product is\ninvariant under the action of Cs\u2032 .\nProof. The inner product of any two vectors can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of inner products of basis vectors, so we are reduced to\nproving hCs\u2032 cx , cw i = hcx , Cs\u2032 cw i for each pair (x, w).\nThere are three cases. If both cx and cw are descended by s, then clearly\nh(t + t\u22121 )cx , cw i = hcx , (t + t\u22121 )cw i.\nIf cx is descended by s but cw is not, then by the equations above\nhCs\u2032 cx , cw i = h(t + t\u22121 )cx , cw i = hcx , Cs\u2032 cw i.\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n21\n\n\u2032\nFinally suppose neither\nP basis vector in hcx , cw i is descended by Cs . Then,\n\u2032\nrecalling that Cs cx = y\u2243L x \u03bc(x, y)cy , we have\nsy<y\n\n(t + t\u22121 )hCs\u2032 cx , cw i = hCs\u2032 Cs\u2032 cx , cw i = hCs\u2032 cx , Cs\u2032 cw i,\nsince each term in Cs\u2032 cx is descended by s. Then by a symmetric argument\nhCs\u2032 cx , Cs\u2032 cw i = hcx , Cs\u2032 Cs\u2032 cw i = (t + t\u22121 )hcx , Cs\u2032 cw i.\nThis completes the proof.\nThe form of these equations is very similar to the conclusion of the\nDecomposition Theorem [1][4]. This analogy suggests an interpretation\nin terms of Poincar\u00e9 polynomials: hcx , cw i as the intersection homology\nPoincare\u00e9 polynomial of the intersection of two spaces KA and KB , (t+t\u22121 )\nas a CP1 , the left side as a CP1 bundle over KA \u2229 KB , and the right side\nas terms from the Decomposition Theorem, applied to some map from the\ntotal space of the bundle to some space.\nThus, given a W -graph for a left cell representation, we can write down\na set of equations that the Gram matrix entries of an Hn -invariant inner\nproduct must satisfy, and which determine them up to a common scalar.\nIf we can prove that the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of some collection of spaces\nsatisfy those equations, and we can calculate the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of\none of the spaces, then we can calculate the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of all the\nspaces in the collection. We will now do this for Springer fibers of hook\nand two-row type, where the W -graphs are known explicitly.\nThe W -graphs for left cells with hook shapes are very easily determined\nbecause no two standard tableaux have the same descent set. (See GarsiaMcLarnan[9], Fact 14, or Curtis-Iwahori- Kilmoyer[6].) Since all left cell\nrepresentations of Hn for a given Young shape are isomorphic([18], Theorem 1.4), we can label the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors by their tableaux.\nDefinition 6.1.\nA standard tableau of hook shape B is adjacent to\nthe standard tableau A via k if B can be obtained from A by exchanging\nk with either k + 1 or k \u2212 1 in the tableau A. Note that exactly one of A\nand B will have k as a descent.\n\nNote that for each standard tableau A and number k, there are at most\ntwo standard tableaux adjacent to A. We denote by (k \u2212 1 k)A the tableau\nobtained by switching k and k \u2212 1 in A; similarly, (k k + 1)A is the tableau\nobtained from A by switching k and k + 1.\nTherefore, in the case of hook shapes, we can explicitly exhibit the set\nof equations that the inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors\n\n\f22\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nmust satisfy. Using the above description of the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of\nthe intersection homology of the components of the Springer fibers and\ntheir intersections, we will show that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9\npolynomials of the intersections of the components satisfy the same equations. Since the equations determine the inner product up to a scalar by\nProposition 6.1, we will be able to show that the inner product matrix of\nthe Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors computes the intersection homology of\nthe Springer fibers for hook shapes.\nTheorem 6.2. Suppose A is a hook shape tableau with top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , k, . . . , i1 ,\nso that the number k is not a descent of the tableau A. Then the KazhdanLusztig basis vector cA transforms as\n\nT(k\n\nk+1) cA\n\n= \u2212cA + tc(k\n\nk\u22121)A\n\n+ tc(k\n\nk+1)A .\n\nIf (k k + 1)A or (k \u2212 1 k)A is not standard, then omit the corresponding\nterm in the formula above.\nIf B is a standard tableau that does not have k in the top row then\nT(k\n\nk+1) cB\n\n= t2 c B .\n\nProof.\nGiven two different Young tableaux A and A\u2032 of hook type, there exists a simple reflection that descends A but not A\u2032 , and a different simple reflection that descends A\u2032 but not A, because their first columns\nare distinct. Given a left cell C of hook type, there is a W -graph for\nthe left cell representation, indexed by elements of C. By ([16], Proposition 7.15), the only edges in the W -graph are those that connect elements of the form x and sx, with s a simple reflection. So in particular the only possible W -graph neighbors to A with k as a descent are\n(k \u2212 1 k)A and (k k + 1)A. Depending on which of k \u2212 1, k + 1 can be\ninterchanged with k in the tableau A, we arrive at the above possibilities.\nLemma 6.4. Given the above tableaux A, B the following are eigenvec\u2032\ntors for the action of C(k\nk+1) :\n\n(t + t\u22121 )cA \u2212 c(k\n\nk\u22121)A\n\n\u2212 c(k\n\nk+1)A\n\nwith eigenvalue 0\n\ncB with eigenvalue (t + t\u22121 )\nIf (k k + 1)A or (k \u2212 1 k)A is not standard, then omit the corresponding\nterm in the formula above.\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\nProof.\n\n23\n\nThis is immediate from Lemma 6.2 and the multiplication for-\n\nmula above.\nTheorem 6.3. Suppose we are given a nilpotent map N on V with a\nYoung shape \u03c4 of hook type. Let T OP be the standard tableau on the shape\n\u03c4 with top row n, b \u2212 1, b \u2212 2, . . . , 1. Normalize the inner products of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors so that the norm hcT OP , cT OP i has the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the Springer fiber component\nKT OP . Then the inner product hcA , cB i is equal to the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the intersection KA \u2229 KB .\n\nTo accomplish this, we define maps between certain spaces, from which\nthe Decomposition Theorem asserts that these intersection homology Poincar\u00e9\npolynomials satisfy the equations of the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products.\nWe need some geometric preliminaries.\nDefinition 6.2. A subvariety X of the flag manifold F l(V ) is a union\nof lines of type k if whenever X contains a flag F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk\u22121 \u2282 Fk \u2282\nFk+1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn , then X contains all flags of the form F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk\u22121 \u2282\nFk\u2032 \u2282 Fk+1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn where Fk\u2032 is between the given subspaces Fk\u22121 and\nFk+1 . We will, by analogy with Weyl groups, also say that k is a descent\nof X. Some authors say that X is k-vertical.\n\nDefinition 6.3. Let X be a subvariety of the flag manifold of GLn (C)\nand 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1. We will denote by CP1 \u22c6 X the variety of pairs\n\n{(Fk\u2032 , F ) where F \u2208 X and Fk\u2032 lies between Fk\u22121 and Fk+1 }.\nThis variety admits a map \u03c6 : CP1 \u22c6 X \u2192 F l(V ) given by mapping\nto the flag F \u2032 = F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk\u22121 \u2282 Fk\u2032 \u2282 Fk+1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fn .\n\n(Fk\u2032 , F )\n\nThe image \u03c6(CP1 \u22c6 X) \u2286 F l(V ) is called the ksaturation of X; this image is denoted Sk (X).\nDefinition 6.4.\n\nSo the k-saturation Sk (X) is obtained roughly by taking all flags in X\nand allowing Fk to vary freely within them. Note that \u03c6\u22121 (F ) is a CP1\nexactly when F is contained in a line of type k in X.\nLemma 6.5. The space CP1 \u22c6 X is a locally trivial fiber bundle over X\n\nwith fiber CP1 via the obvious map (Fk\u2032 , F ) 7\u2192 F .\n\n\f24\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nProof. This is clear.\nRemark 6. 1. We can also rephrase this using a minimal parabolic\nsubgroup Pk corresponding to the simple reflection (k k + 1). Then the\nmap \u03c0 : G/B \u2192 G/Pk forgets about Fk , so the preimage \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c0(X)) is\nequal to \u03c6(CP1 \u22c6 X).\nSuppose we have two standard tableaux A with top row n, ib\u22121 , . . . , k =\nij , . . . , i1 and B with top row n, i\u2032b\u22121 , . . . , k\u0302, . . . , i\u20321 (that is, k is in the jth\nposition from the right in A, but is not in the top row in B). Then k\nis a descent of the component KB but not of the component KA . Let\nthe position of k in the top row of A be ij . Then we have the adjacent\ncomponents K(k k\u22121)A and K(k k+1)A of the Springer fiber BN that have k\nas a descent. Then we shall show that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial of the k-saturation of the intersection KB \u2229 KA equals the sum\nof the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of KB \u2229 K(k k\u22121)A and\nKB \u2229 K(k k+1)A , and we shall show how this equality can be interpreted in\nterms of the Decomposition Theorem.\nTheorem 6.4. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type. Let A and B be\ntwo standard tableau on the Young shape of N such that k is a descent of\nB but not of A. Then the intersection KA \u2229 KB of the two components KA\nand KB of the Springer fiber BN is not k-saturated. Then the map \u03c6 from\nCP1 \u22c6 (KB \u2229 KA ) to the k- saturation Sk (KB \u2229 KA ) yields an equation of\nintersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials\n\nIP (CP1 \u22c6 (KB \u2229 KA )) = IP (K(k\n\nk+1)A\n\n\u2229 KB ) + IP (K(k\u22121\n\nk)A\n\n\u2229 KB ).\n\nRemember that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial IP is normalized so that the sum is centered around the degree 0 term.\nIf either (k \u2212 1 k)A or (k k + 1)A is not standard, then omit the corresponding term in the above. If both are not standard then the intersection\nKB \u2229 KA is empty.\nProof. Suppose that we have the intersection KA \u2229 KB of two components KA and KB where k is a descent of B but not of A. Let k = ij in A.\nFirst, if neither (k \u2212 1 k)A or (k k + 1)A is standard, then we can check\nby Theorem 4.1 that the intersection KA \u2229 KB is empty. In fact, suppose\nKA \u2229 KB is nonempty. Then if A has top row ij+1 = k + 1, ij = k and\nij\u22121 = k \u2212 1, then \u03b2j\u22121 = k \u2212 1 and \u03b1j+1 = k + 1. Then in the tableau\nB, the entry i\u2032j must satisfy k \u2212 1 < i\u2032j < k + 1, but i\u2032j 6= k because k is a\ndescent of B, which is a contradiction.\nSuppose first that (k k + 1)A is standard. Then ij = k, ij\u22121 < k \u2212 1\nand ij+1 > k + 1. Now the term i\u2032j in B must satisfy either i\u2032j > k or\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n25\n\ni\u2032j < k. Suppose now that i\u2032j > k (which is only possible when (k k + 1)A\nis standard), so that k = \u03b1j and i\u2032j = \u03b2j . Then for any F \u2208 KA \u2229 KB , the\nsubspaces of F satisfy\nim N b\u2212j \u2282 Fk \u2282 Fk+1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fi\u2032j \u2282 ker N j\nNote that KA \u2229 KB has a (Zariski) open subset of flags with im N b\u2212j \u2282\nFk but im N b\u2212j 6\u2282 Fk\u22121 . In such flags, Fk is determined by Fk\u22121 (and\nim N b\u2212j ), so the intersection KA \u2229 KB is not a union of lines of type k.\nSo the k-saturation of the intersection KA \u2229 KB consists of all flags\n* * * Fk\u22121 \u2282 Fk\u2032 \u2282 Fk+1 * * * , where Fk\u2032 is any subspace between Fk\u22121 and\nFk+1 . In particular, Fk\u2032 no longer need contain im N b\u2212j . However, the subspace Fk+1 must still contain im N b\u2212j in all of the resulting flags. Therefore\nthe k-saturation of KB \u2229 KA is all flags with\nim N b\u2212j \u2286 Fk+1 \u2282 Fij \u2286 ker N j ,\nand all the other conditions unaffected. Therefore the k-saturation Sk (KA \u2229\nKB ) is indeed K(k k+1)A \u2229 KB .\nIf (k \u2212 1 k)A is also standard, then there will be a nonempty subset of\nKB \u2229 KA consisting of those flags in the intersection for which\nim N b\u2212j \u2282 Fk\u22121 \u2282 Fij \u2282 ker N j\nwhich clearly corresponds to the intersection KB \u2229K(k\u22121 k)A ; this subset is\na union of lines of type k. The subvariety KB \u2229K(k\u22121 k)A is of codimension\n2 in KB \u2229 K(k k+1)A .\nTherefore we have a map \u03c6 : CP1 \u22c6 (KB \u2229 KA ) \u2192 K(k k+1)A \u2229 KB . This\nmap is generically 1 \u2212 1. The map \u03c6 is a semismall resolution, because\nthe subvariety where \u03c6 has a CP1 fiber is exactly K(k\u22121 k)A \u2229 KB , which\nis of codimension 2 in the image space K(k k+1)A \u2229 KB , and the domain is\nnonsingular.\nTherefore when we invoke the Decomposition Theorem for semismall\nmaps [3][4], we find that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial\nIP (CP1 \u22c6 (KB \u2229 KA )) equals the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial IP (K(k k+1)A \u2229 KB ) of the range, plus the intersection homology\nIP (K(k\u22121 k)A \u2229 KB ) of the smaller intersection. (Remember that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial IP is normalized so that all of\nthese sums will be centered around 0.)\nIf (k k+1)A is standard but (k\u22121 k) is not, then K(k\u22121 k)A \u2229KB is empty,\nso its term is omitted. Finally, if i\u2032j < k so k = \u03b2j (which is only possible if\n(k\u22121 k)A is standard), then the roles of K(k\u22121 k)A and K(k k+1)A will be reversed in the above argument.\n\n\f26\n\nFRANCIS Y.

STRUCTURE OF INTERSECTIONS OF COMPONENTS\nOF TWO-ROW TYPE AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH\nKAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY\nNow we compute the intersection homology Poincar\u00e8 polynomials of pairwise intersections of components and then relate them to Kazhdan-Lusztig\ntheory. In doing so, we also correct a result of Wolper[30].\nLet N be a nilpotent map with a two-row Young shape \u03c4 . In this section we prove that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of the\nintersections of the components of the Springer fiber BN coincide with the\n(appropriately normalized) inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis\nvectors of the left cell representation of Hn associated to the Young shape\n\u03c4.\nThe Kazhdan-Lusztig inner product matrix has been studied for left cell\nrepresentations of two- row type because they yield the representations of\nthe so-called Temperley-Lieb algebra[29]. We shall understand how the\ncombinatorics of the Temperley-Lieb algebra representations encodes the\nstructure of the intersections of components of the Springer fiber.\nFirst, let us review some notions from Temperley-Lieb theory[29].\n\n\f27\n\nTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\nDefinition 7.1. Suppose we have the numbers 1 to n on a horizontal\nline, increasing to the right. Then an (n, p)-cup diagram consists of p\ncups on these numbers, where each cup connects two numbers, no two\ncups intersect each other, and no number is underneath a cup and yet not\nconnected to any cup. The entire cup diagram must lie in one half- plane.\n\nLemma 7.1. Suppose \u03c4 is a Young shape with n boxes and n \u2212 b boxes in\nthe second row. Then there is a bijection between standard Young tableaux\non \u03c4 and (n, n\u2212 b)-cup diagrams. This bijection is denoted A \u2192 CupD(A).\n\nProof. Let A be a standard tableau of shape \u03c4 . We construct a cup\ndiagram as follows. Begin at the number 1 on the horizontal line. Proceed\nfrom left to right, starting a cup at i if the number i is on the bottom row of\nA, and ending a cup if i is on the top row by matching the number i with the\nclosest started cup that can be matched with i. All unpaired ends of cups\nare then left blank (these are called orphaned numbers). It is easily seen\nthat this procedure produces a bijection between cup diagrams and two-row\ntableaux.\nExample 7.1.\n\n1\n\nThe (7, 3) cup diagram\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\ncorresponds to the standard Young tableau\n7 5 4 3\n6 2 1\n\nLemma 7.2. A two-row standard tableau A has a descent at i if and only\nif the associated cup diagram CupD(A) has a cup connecting i and i + 1.\nSuch a cup will be called a minimal cup.\n\nProof. The tableau A has a descent exactly when i is on the bottom\nrow and i + 1 is on the top row. This is the case exactly when there is\ncup connecting the numbers i and i + 1 in the cup diagram CupD(A).\n\n\f28\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\nWe shall exhibit a correspondence between the cup diagram CupD(A)\nand the dependencies among the subspaces of the flags in the component\nKA . First, let us extend the cup diagram CupD(A) by adding the numbers\n0, \u22121, . . . , \u2212(n \u2212 b) to the left of the numbers 1, . . . , n. Now match each\norphaned number in the cup diagram, working from left to right, to the\nclosest possible negative number. This creates an extended cup diagram\nthat we label ECupD(A). Note that there are no additional choices here\nso these extended cup diagrams are still in bijection with the standard\ntableaux. For a point i which is an endpoint of a cup, denote by \u03c3(i) the\nother endpoint of the cup.\nDefinition 7.2.\nGiven a cup diagram CupD(A) and an index i at\nwhich a cup begins or ends, we denote by CupA (i) the cup that begins or\nends at i.\n\nRecall that a subspace Fi in a component KA is called dependent if F\nis specified by Theorem 5.2 as the inverse image of some smaller subspace\n(equivalently, the number i is on the top row of A), and is said to depend\non that smaller space. Otherwise the subspace is called independent.\nRemark 7. 1. For \u2212(n \u2212 b) \u2264 i < 0, we interpret Fi to mean im N b\u2212i .\n\nDefinition 7.3. A cup Cup1 lies directly beneath a cup Cup2 if Cup1\nis beneath Cup2 and there are no other cups that lie both above Cup1 and\nbelow Cup2 .\n\nTheorem 7.1. Consider a nilpotent map N and a two-row standard\ntableau A on the Young shape of N . Then the extended cup diagram\nECupD(A) encodes the dependencies among the subspaces of the flags in\nKA as follows. If a cup begins at i, then Fi is independent. If a cup ends\nat i then Fi is an inverse image of F\u03c3(i)\u22121 (interpreted using convention\n7.1).\n\nProof. Let i > 0. First, note that Fi is independent iff the number i\nis on the bottom row of the tableau A. This is true iff i starts a cup in\nECupD(A). The subspace Fi is dependent on a smaller subspace iff i ends\na cup in ECupD(A).\nNow suppose Fi is dependent. We apply the characterization of Theorem\n5.2. Let us proceed by induction on the length |\u03c3(i)\u2212i| of the cup CupA (i).\nIf i \u2212 1 is independent, then Fi is equal to N \u22121 (Fi\u22122 ). On the other hand,\ni \u2212 1 starts a cup and i ends the cup, so there must be a minimal cup\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n29\n\nconnecting i \u2212 1 and i, and so i \u2212 2 = \u03c3(i) \u2212 1. This proves the |\u03c3(i) \u2212 i| = 1\ncase.\nNow suppose that i is dependent and i \u2212 1 is also dependent. Then,\nsince cups cannot cross, we see that \u03c3(i) < \u03c3(i \u2212 1), so that the cup\nCupA (i \u2212 1) is shorter than the cup CupA (i). Now note that all numbers\nunder the cup CupA (i) must either begin or end a cup. So if \u03c3(i \u2212 1) 6=\n\u03c3(i) + 1, then there must exist a sequence of adjacent cups directly beneath CupA (i) beginning at \u03c3(i) + 1 and ending at \u03c3(i \u2212 1) \u2212 1. Then\nby induction, the space Fi\u22121 depends on the independent subspace F\u03c3(i) ,\nso by Theorem 5.2 the subspace Fi depends on the subspace F\u03c3(i)\u22121 .\nProposition 7.1. Suppose i > 0 begins a cup in CupD(A). If a subspace Fj depends on the (independent) subspace Fi , then i < j < \u03c3(i); that\nis, j lies strictly under the cup that begins at i. In fact, if j is the end of a\ncup that lies directly beneath CupA (i) then Fj depends in Fi .\n\nProof. Note first that j > i since Fj is to depend on the independent\nsubspace Fi . Recall that since Fj is dependent, j ends a cup, and Fj\ndepends on the subspace F\u03c3(j)\u22121 . Either that subspace is independent, or\n\u03c3(j) \u2212 1 ends another cup so F\u03c3(j)\u22121 depends on \u03c3(\u03c3(j) \u2212 1) \u2212 1, and so\nforth.\nIf j > i and j does not lie strictly under the cup starting at i then either\n\u03c3(j) < i or \u03c3(j) > \u03c3(i) so \u03c3(j) \u2212 1 cannot lie strictly under the cup either.\nIf \u03c3(j) \u2212 1 = \u03c3(i) then Fj depends on Fi\u22121 and thus not on Fi . So, F\u03c3(j)\u22121\ncannot depend on Fi unless i < j < \u03c3(i).\nAs to the last assertion, note that if j ends a cup lying directly beneath\nCupA (i), then Fj must depend on F\u03c3(j)\u22121 . Then \u03c3(j) \u2212 1 must also end\na cup lying directly beneath CupA (i) unless \u03c3(j)\u22121 = i. This completes the\nproof.\nNow we demonstrate that the intersections of components of the Springer\nfiber BN satisfy the equations for the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products.\nSuppose A is a standard tableau on the shape of N . Suppose i is not a\ndescent of A (so it is not the case that i is on the bottom row and i + 1 is\non top). The assertion that i is not a descent is equivalent to the assertion\nthat there is not a cup joining i and i + 1. Then, we can manufacture a\ncup diagram having i as a descent.\nDefinition 7.4.\nSuppose CupD(A) is a cup diagram that does not\nhave a minimal cup connecting i and i + 1. Suppose \u03c3(i) 6= i and \u03c3(i + 1) 6=\ni + 1. Then the cup diagram CupD(ui A) is defined by deleting the cups\nwith endpoints at i and i + 1, then connecting i and i + 1 with a minimal\ncup and connecting \u03c3(i) to \u03c3(i + 1) with another cup. If exactly one of\n\n\f30\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\n\u03c3(i) = i or \u03c3(i + 1) = i + 1, then we only insert the cup between i and i + 1.\nIf both \u03c3(i) = i and \u03c3(i + 1) = i + 1 then CupD(ui A) does not exist. Note\nthat this definition also defines a standard tableau ui A.\nIn Westbury[29] it is proven that the tableau ui A gives the unique W graph neighbor to A that has i as a descent; if this tableau ui A does not\nexist, then there are no neighbors to A in the W -graph with i as a descent.\nWe now show that if we i-saturate the intersection KA \u2229 KB (where KB is\ndescended by i) then we get the intersection Kui A \u2229 KB .\nTheorem 7.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Consider two\nstandard tableaux A and B on the Young shape of N such that i descends\nB but not A. Suppose ui A is the unique W -graph neighbor to A that has i\nas a descent. Then the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of the\nintersections satisfy the following equality:\n\n(t + t\u22121 )IP (KA \u2229 KB ) = IP (Kui A \u2229 KB ).\nIf there is no such neighbor ui A then the intersection KA \u2229 KB is empty.\nProof. We shall show that the i-saturation CP1 \u22c6 (KA \u2229 KB ) of the\nintersection KA \u2229KB has Fi independent, but all other dependencies among\nthe other subspaces are the same as in KA \u2229 KB . This will prove the\ntheorem. We use the fact that if Fj depends on Fi , then we can also\ndetermine Fi from knowledge of Fj (Proposition 5.2).\nThere are several cases; first note that in all cases, Fi+1 = N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 )\nbecause this dependency holds in KB .\n1. Suppose \u03c3(i + 1) < \u03c3(i) < i < i + 1 in A. First, for a flag F in the\ncomponent KA , we see that Fi+1 depends on F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 . Because Fi+1 =\nN \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) in KB , we see that Fi+1 must depend on Fi\u22121 . Now in the\ncomponent KA , the number i \u2212 1 is either equal to \u03c3(i), or i \u2212 1 lies at the\nend of a cup lying directly under CupA (i). So the subspace Fi\u22121 depends\non the subspace for the start of the cup CupA (i), namely F\u03c3(i) . Thus Fi+1\ndepends on F\u03c3(i) . Since Fi+1 depends on F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 in KA , we see that\nF\u03c3(i) must depend on F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 in the intersection KA \u2229 KB .\nThen in the transformed tableau ui A, we now have a cup connecting\n\u03c3(i + 1) to \u03c3(i) and one connecting i to i + 1. This means that for any flag\nF in the component Kui A , F\u03c3(i) is dependent on F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 . Thus the intersection Kui A \u2229 KB will have all the same dependencies between subspaces\nas KA \u2229 KB does, except that Kui A \u2229 KB will be i-saturated.\n2. Suppose \u03c3(i) < i < i + 1 < \u03c3(i + 1). Then in KA , the subspace Fi\ndepends on F\u03c3(i)\u22121 , and F\u03c3(i+1) depends on Fi and thus on F\u03c3(i)\u22121 .\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n31\n\nNow for any flag F in Kui A , the subspace F\u03c3(i+1) depends on F\u03c3(i)\u22121 as\nwell. No dependency is imposed on Fi+1 that was not present in KA \u2229 KB .\n3. Suppose i < i + 1 < \u03c3(i + 1) < \u03c3(i). Then for any flag F in the\ncomponent KA , the subspace F\u03c3(i) depends on Fi\u22121 , and the subspace\nF\u03c3(i+1) depends on Fi . Also \u03c3(i + 1) \u2212 1 is either i + 1 or is the end\nof a cup directly under CupA (i + 1). So, by Proposition 7.1, the subspace\nF\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 depends on Fi+1 . Thus in the intersection KA \u2229KB , the subspace\nF\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 depends on Fi\u22121 .\nThen in Kui A , we have that F\u03c3(i) depends on F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 . By the same chain\nof dependencies, F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121 depends on Fi+1 and thus on Fi\u22121 , so F\u03c3(i+1)\u22121\ndepends on Fi\u22121 . Finally, the subspace F\u03c3(i+1) (which in KA depended on\nFi ) does not depend in Kui A on Fi .\n4. Note that the above two arguments are identical if exactly one of \u03c3(i)\nand \u03c3(i + 1) is negative.\n5. Finally, if both \u03c3(i) and \u03c3(i + 1) are negative, then in the original\ncup diagram CupD(A), both i and i + 1 are orphans. This is exactly the\ncase where there is no W -graph neighbor to A having i as a descent (see\nWestbury[29]). So we show that the intersection KA \u2229 KB has to be empty.\nIn the component KB where i is a descent, Fi+1 = N \u22121 (Fi\u22121 ) and so Fi+1\nis chosen to contain exactly one lower image than Fi\u22121 as well as Fi .\nOn the other hand, consider a flag F in the component KA where i is not\na descent. In the original cup diagram CupD(A), both i and i + 1 are\norphans. Therefore Fi\u22121 is also dependent (otherwise i \u2212 1 would have to\nconnect to i). So Fi is chosen to contain exactly one lower image than\nFi\u22121 , and in fact Fi = N \u2212k (im N j ) for some j, k. Then Fi+1 is chosen to\ncontain exactly one lower image than Fi and in fact Fi = N \u2212k (im N j\u22121 ).\nThus, in KA , the subspace Fi+1 must contain two lower images than Fi\u22121 .\nBut in KB , the subspace Fi+1 must contain exactly one lower image then\nFi\u22121 . Therefore there are no flags in the intersection KA \u2229 KB .\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the possibilities; in each case, the relevant subdiagrams of the cup diagrams CupD(A) and CupD(ui A) are on the\ntop left and top right respectively. The relevant subdiagram of CupD(B)\nis on the bottom in all cases.\n\n\f32\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 (i+1)\n\n\u03c3 (i)\n\n\u03c3 (i)\n\ni\n\n5\n\ni+1\n\ni\n\ni+1\n\ni+1\n\n\u03c3 (i+1)\n\n\u03c3 (i+1)\n\n\u03c3 (i)\n\ni\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFRANCIS Y.

Thus the Decomposition Theorem yields the conclusion of\nthe theorem.\nAs a complement, we describe the computation of the inner product\nmatrix of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis for a two-row shape.\nTheorem 7.3. (Westbury[29], Graham-Lehrer[13]) Let \u03c4 be a two-row\nYoung shape, and let A and B be two standard tableaux on the shape of \u03c4 .\nConsider the diagram formed by placing the cup diagram CupD(A) above\nthe horizontal line, and CupD(B) below. Suppose the diagram contains r\nclosed loops, and also that the endpoints of each open arc are pointing in\nopposite directions. Then the inner product of two Kazhdan-Lusztig basis\nvectors cA and cB is hcA , cB i = (t + t\u22121 )r . If an open arc in the diagram\nhas both ends pointing in the same direction, then the inner product is 0.\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n33\n\nProof. See Westbury[29], Sections 5 and 7, and Graham-Lehrer[13],\nSection 6. Note that their answer differs from ours by a sign because\nthey use the other Kazhdan-Lusztig basis arising from the elements Cw .\nConjecture 7.1. Based on the strong evidence of the above calculations,\nwe conjecture that the pairwise intersections of components of Springer\nfibers of two-row type are also iterated CP1 bundles. It would suffice to\nshow that each pairwise intersection admits a description of the same form\nas Theorem 5.2. Of course, Theorem 5.2 shows that the intersection of\ntwo components consists of all flags that satisfy the descriptions of both\ncomponents simultaneously. So it remains to show that there is a single\ndescription of the same form for the intersection.\n\n8. FURTHER SPECULATIONS\nMuch research into the relation between the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis and\nthe Springer fibers for GLn (C) has been stimulated by the conjecture in\nKazhdan-Lusztig[18] 6.3, which states that with the tableau labelings of\nthe Springer fiber components and the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors, the\ncodimension 1 intersections of the components yield the edges of the left\ncell W -graphs. It was also conceivable that the Springer basis and the\nKazhdan-Lusztig basis were the same at the level of Sn , and that perhaps\nthere was a way to get an Iwahori-Hecke algebra action on the Springer\nbasis[25].\nRecent work of Kashiwara-Saito[17] disproved a conjecture concerning\nirreducibility of a certain characteristic variety, which implies that the\nSpringer and Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are indeed different at the Sn level,\nand disproves conjecture 6.3 in general.\nFor hook shapes, the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis is known to coincide with\nthe Springer basis for Sn (see G\u00fcemes[14]); the conjecture [18] 6.3 also\nholds for two-row shapes, because of the equations established in Chapter 5 and the work of Lascoux-Sch\u00fctzenberger[20] (see also Westbury[29]\nand Wolper[30]). In fact, for representations of Sn labeled by hooks and\ntwo-rows (and all left cells for which the Bruhat order coincides with the\nweak Bruhat order), [18] 6.3 is known in the sense that Hotta's transformation formula(see Hotta[15] and Borho-Brylinski-MacPherson[2]) for the\nSpringer basis coincides with the Kazhdan-Lusztig transformation formula\n(see Douglass[8]).\nIt is not yet clear how the results of this dissertation fit into the framework of the above results and counterexamples. The Kazhdan-Lusztig inner\nproducts, properly normalized, are always polynomials that are symmetric\n\n\f34\n\nFRANCIS Y. C. FUNG\n\naround 0; that is, invariant with respect to the map t \u2192 t\u22121 . So we would\nlike them to correspond to a method of associating a symmetric Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial to each component (and to each pairwise intersection of components) of the Springer fiber. In the cases in this work, all components\nand intersections were nonsingular, so the homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials were already symmetric, once shifted appropriately. A natural choice\nfor a symmetric Poincar\u00e9 polynomial to a singular variety is the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. In the nonsingular case, intersection\nhomology coincides with ordinary homology, except for the shift. Also, intersection homology satisfies the crucial Decomposition Theorem[1]. However, it appears that the natural conjecture extending Theorems 6.2 and\n7.2 using intersection homology alone is not correct. The first example of a\nsingular component arises in S6 (see Vargas[28] and Spaltenstein[24]). This\ncomponent X is specified in our notation by the tableau\n6 4\n5 2\n3\n1\nand X can be given the following description. The component X consists\nof flags F such that F2 \u2282 ker N , F2 \u2229 im N has dimension at least 1,\nF4 \u2229 ker N has dimension at least 3, F4 \u2282 N \u22121 (F2 ), and im N \u2282 F4 . In\nthe Spaltenstein- Vargas subset for this component, F2 \u2229 im N is a onedimensional space p and F4 is chosen in N \u22121 (p) to contain im N . Since\nF4 and ker N are both 4-dimensional subspaces of the 5-dimensional space\nN \u22121 (p), their intersection F4 \u2229 ker N = P L must have at least dimension\n3 and contain im N .\nThe singular set of the component X consists of those flags such that\nF2 = im N and F4 = ker N . In those cases, the one-dimensional subspace\np is no longer uniquely determined, nor is the 3-dimensional space P L. If,\nfor each flag in X, we choose a 1-dimensional subspace in im N \u2229 F2 and a\n3-dimensional subspace in F4 \u2229 ker N , then the resulting space X\u0303 of such\ntriples is a resolution of singularities of X. Also, the fiber over a point in\nthe singular set is a CP1 \u00d7 CP1 . The singular set has complex codimension\n4. Thus the resolution is semismall.\nWe can see that space X\u0303 has homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial equal to\n[2][2][2][2][2][2][2] as follows. The choice of a 1-dimensional subspace p in\nim N is a CP1 . Then the choice of a 3-dimensional space P L in ker N ,\ncontaining im N , is a CP1 . Then the choice of a 2-dimensional space F2\ncontaining p and contained in P L is a CP1 . The choice of a space F4\ncontaining P L and contained in the 5-dimensional space N \u22121 (p) is another\nCP1 . Finally, since X is a union of lines of types 1, 3, and 5, the other\nchoices each contribute a CP1 . This exhibits X\u0303 as an iterated fiber bundle.\n\n\fTOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS\n\n35\n\nThe semismall Decomposition Theorem says that the intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial IP (X\u0303) of the resolution X\u0303 equals the sum of IP 's\nof strata of X, each with multiplicity equal to the number of components\nof the fiber over the point in the stratum. So we can compute IP (X), since\nwe know that the fiber over each point in the stratum CP1 \u00d7 CP1 \u00d7 CP1\nis CP1 \u00d7 CP1 . Thus [2][2][2][2][2][2][2] = IP (X) + [2][2][2]. However, the\nentry in our normalized inner product matrix is [2][2][2][2][2][2][2], which is\nlarger the homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of X\u0303.\nHowever, this suggests that perhaps the inner products correspond to\nsome other semisimple perverse sheaves (see Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne[1])\nin the intersections KA \u2229 KB , since semisimple perverse sheaves also satisfy the Decomposition Theorem and have symmetric Poincar\u00e9 polynomials. We also have examples of inner products (from the same shape as the\nabove example) that are the sum of intersection homology Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of multiple irreducible components of the corresponding intersection\nof two components of the Springer fiber. This lends further weight to the\nidea of using semisimple perverse sheaves on the intersection KA \u2229 KB\nof two components of the Springer fiber, since the appropriate Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial is obtained by summing the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of the irreducible components of the intersection KA \u2229 KB . The data also suggests\nthat it would be worthwhile to investigate the structure of resolutions of\nsingularities of components of Springer fibers.\nThere is now W -graph data available up to S15 (see Ochiai-Kako[23])\nand it would be interesting to compute the inner products of the KazhdanLusztig basis vectors from them. For instance, one could check whether\nthey satisfy the Hard Lefschetz theorem.\nThere is of course more to be done on the computation of the topology of\nthe components of the Springer fibers. The techniques exposed here exploit\nthe relative simplicity of the structures of the nilpotent maps for hook and\ntwo-row types. It would be interesting to understand these components\nbetter. Even in the two-row case, it would be worthwhile to gain more\ninformation on the structure of the fiber bundles, for instance extensions\nof Lorist's theorem[21] concerning the e-invariants of the nontrivial CP1\nbundles.\nWe believe that further study of the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products and\ntheir relation to the components of Springer fibers will prove to be fruitful,\nand that there are many questions left to be answered here.\nREFERENCES\n1.
