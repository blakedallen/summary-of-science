Introduction\nThe formulation of D-brane theories in the\npresence of constant antisymmetric background\nfields and its relation to noncommutative gauge\ntheories has recently attracted a lot of interest\n[1]-[22]. It may well be that a noncommutative\nformulation of the D=11 Supermembrane and the\nSuper M5-brane may indeed improve the understanding of the quantum aspects of these theories.\nThe spectrum of the D=11 Supermembrane on\na Minkowski target space was shown to be continuous from zero to infinite [23]. However not\nmuch it is known about the spectrum of the theory when the target space is compactified [24][26]. Even less it is known about the spectrum\nof the M5-brane. Nevertheless, one may extrapolate some known aspects from the Supermembrane case since both theories are U-dual. The\ncovariant formulation of the M5-brane was found\nin [27] and [28]. However the analysis of its physical hamiltonian, the existence of singular configurations, the topological instabilities and related\nproblems have not yet been discussed in a conclu-\n\nsive way. It is possible that a formulation of these\ntheories in terms of a noncommutative geometry\nmay allow an improvement in their analysis.\nWe describe in this talk a general approach to\nreach that formulation. The first step is to introduce a symplectic geometry intrinsic to the theory. This may be done when the target space\nis suitably compactified. The non degenerate\nclosed 2-form associated to the symplectic geometry may be obtained in a general way from the\nanalysis of the Born-Infield action. We discuss\nthis problem in section 2. The second step in the\nconstruction is to obtain the hamiltonian of the\nD-brane with non trivial wrapping on the target\nspace. We perform this construction for the double compactified D=11 Supermembrane [29], [30]\nand the compactified 4 D-brane in 10 dimensions.\nIt turns out that the minima of these hamiltonians are described by the dual configurations introduced in [31] and in section 2. The final step\nis to introduce the geometrical objects describing\nthe noncommutative formulation. This is done in\nterms of a symplectic fibration and a symplectic\n\n\f2\nconnection over it. We also consider deformations\nof the brackets introduced in these theories, allowing a construction of noncommutative gauge\ntheories in terms of the usual Moyal star product. There is a precise one to one correspondence\nin the sense of Kontsevich, between the original\ntheories and their deformations.\n\nwhere n = D\n2 ,i.e we assume the dimension D of M\nto be an even natural number. (6) is the condition\nthat the Hodge dual transformation maps the set\n{Pm , m = 0, . . . , n} into itself.\nWe observe that these connections, if they exist\nin a U (1) principle bundle over M , are solutions\nof the field equations (5).\nIn fact, (6) implies\n\n2. The dual configurations\n\n\u2217 [Pm \u2227 \u2217Pm ] = km \u2217 [Pm \u2227 Pn\u2212m ] = km \u2217 Pn (7)\n\nThe Born-Infeld theory formulated over a Riemannian manifold M may be described by the\nfollowing D dimensional action\nZ \u0010p\n\u221a \u0011\nS (A) =\ndet (gab + bFab ) \u2212 g dD x\n(1)\n\nbut from (6), for m = n, we obtain\n\nwhere gab is an external euclidean metric over the\ncompact closed manifold M . Fab are the components of the curvature of connection 1-form A\nover a U (1) principle bundle on M .b is a constant\nparameter.\nWe may express the det (gab + bFab ), using the\ngeneral formula obtained in [31], as\n\nFinally, it results\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\nd W \u2212 2 \u2217Pm = km W \u2212 2 d (Pn\u2212m ) = 0,\n\nM\n\ndet (gab + bFab ) = g\n\nn\nX\n\nm=0\n\nam b2m \u2217 [Pm \u2227 \u2217Pm ]\n\n\u2261 gW,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nPm \u2261 F\n. . \u2227 F}\n| \u2227 .{z\n\n(3)\n\nm\n\nam are known constants, see [31].\nThe first variation of (1) is given by\nZ\nX\n1\n\u03b4S (A) = W \u2212 2\nmam b2m d\u03b4A\u2227Pm\u22121 \u2227\u2217Pm (4)\nM\n\nm\n\nwhich yields the following field equations\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n1\nmam b2m Pm\u22121 \u2227 d W \u2212 2 \u2217Pm = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nm\n\nWe introduce now a set A of U (1) connection\n1-forms over M [31]. They are defined by the\nfollowing conditions,\n\u2217Pm (A) = km Pn\u2212m (A)\n\n, m = 0, . . . , n, (6)\n\n\u2217 Pn = kn\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is constant. We thus have, for these connections,\nW = constant.\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nshowing that (6), if they exits, define a set of\nsolutions to the Born-Infeld field equations.\nLet us analyse a particular case of (6). Let us\nconsider n = D\n2 = 1. We then have\n\u2217P1 = \u2217F = k1 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis solution represents a monopole connection\nover the D = 2 manifold M . When M is the\nsphere S2 , (11) defines the U (1) connection describing the Dirac monopole on the Hopf fibring\nS3 \u2192 S2 . The constant k1 is determined from the\ncondition\nZ\nF = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 integer\n(12)\nM\n\nwhich is a necessary condition to be satisfied for\na U (1) connection, F being its curvature.\nThis solution was extended to U (1) connections\nover Riemann surfaces of any genus in [32] . In\n[29] it was shown that they describe the minima of\nthe hamiltonian of the double compactified D =\n11 supermembrane dual.\n3. Hamiltonian formulation\nThe hamiltonian formulation of the double\ncompactified D=11 Supermembrane dual was obtained in [30]. Its hamiltonian density in the light\n\n\f3\ncone gauge is the following\n1 1\nH= \u221a\nP M PM + det(\u2202a X M \u2202b XM )\n2 W\n\u0013\n1\n1\n+(\u03a0ar \u2202a X M )2 + (\u03a0ar \u03a0bs \u01ebab \u01ebrs )2 + W (\u2217F r )2\n4\n4\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\nc r\n\u2202a X PM + \u03a0r Fac\n\u221a\n(13)\n\u2212Ar0 \u2202c \u03a0cr + \u039b\u01ebab \u2202b\nW\nwhere PM are the conjugate momentum to X M\nwhile \u03a0ar are the corresponding momentum to Ara .\nThe index r denote the 2 compactified directions\non the target space. a is the world volume index\nwhile M label the LCG transverse directions in\nthe target space.\nIts supersymmetric extension may be obtained\nin an straightforward way from the supermembrane hamiltonian in the LCG by the procedure\ndescribed in [30].\nWe may solve explicitly the constraints on \u03a0cr\nobtaining\n\u03a0cr = \u01ebcb \u2202b \u03a0r ;\n\nr = 1, 2\n\n(14)\n\nDefining the 2-form \u03c9 in terms of \u03a0r as\n\u03c9 = \u2202a \u03a0r \u2202b \u03a0s \u01ebrs d\u03be a \u2227 d\u03be b ,\n\n(15)\n\nthe condition of non trivial membrane winding\nimposes a restriction on it, namely\nI\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0n.\n(16)\n\u03a3\n\nWith this condition on \u03c9, Weil's theorem ensures that there always exist an associated U (1)\nprincipal bundle over \u03a3 and a connection on it\nsuch that \u03c9 is its curvature. The minimal configurations for the hamiltonian (13) may be expressed in terms of such connections.\nIn [29] the minimal configurations of the hamiltonian of the double compactified supermembrane were obtained. In spite of the fact that the\nexplicit expression (13) was not then obtained,\nall the minimal configurations were found. They\ncorrespond to \u03a0r = \u03a0\u0302r satisfying\n\u221a\nn 6= 0 (17)\n\u2217 \u03c9\u0302 = \u01ebab \u2202a \u03a0\u0302r \u2202b \u03a0\u0302s \u01ebrs = n W\nThe explicit expressions for \u03a0\u0302r were obtained in\nthat paper [29]. As mentioned before, they correspond to U (1) connections on non trivial principle\n\nbundles over \u03a3. The principle bundle is characterized by the integer n corresponding to an irreducible winding of the supermembrane. Moreover\nthe semiclassical approximation of the hamiltonian density around the minimal configuration,\nwas shown to agree with the hamiltonian density of super Maxwell theory on the world sheet,\nminimally coupled to the seven scalar fields representing the coordinates transverse to the world\nvolume of the super-brane.\nAs mention in the introduction these minima\ncorrespond to the dual solutions of section 2 corresponding to 2D-brane. We now consider the\nhamiltonian of the D=10 4D-brane. It may be\nobtained by the following double dimensional reduction procedure. We start from the PST action for the super M5-brane. We consider the\ngauge fixing condition which fixes the scalar field\nto be proportional to the world volume time. We\nthen perform the usual double dimensional reduction by taking one of the target space coordinates\nX 11 = \u03c3 5 where \u03c3 5 is one of the world volume local coordinates.

We will work only with the diffeomorphisms connected to the identity.\nWe now consider a target space with 4 compactified directions, M6 xS 1 xS 1 xS 1 xS 1 . We construct the dual formulation associated to the compactified directions. We associate to each Xr ,\nr = 1, ..., 4 a B 3 3-form\ndXr \u2192 dBr3\n\n(25)\n\nIt is more convenient to work with the Hodge dual\nof the 3-form,\nBrijk \u2192 Alr\n\n(26)\n\nin the spatial world volume sector Brijo are Lagrange multipliers. We denote \u03a0rl the conjugate\nmomenta to Alr .\nThere is a constraint on \u03a0rl which yields\n\u03a0rl = \u2202l \u03a0r\n\n(27)\n\nWe may then perform a canonical transformation\nto obtain\n\u03a0rl \u0226lr = \u03a0\u0307r (\u2202l Alr )\n\n(28)\n\nthat is, \u2202l Alr is the conjugate momenta to \u03a0r :\n\u03a0r \u2261 Ar\n\n\u2202l Alr \u2261 \u03a0 r\n\n(29)\n\nWe then obtain the dual formulation to (23).\nFor the determinant of the induced metric we\nobtain\n\u00012\n1 i1 ...i4\n\u2202i1 X a1 ...\u2202i4 X a4\n\u01eb\n4!\n\u00012\n1 i1 ...i4\n\u2202i1 X b1 ...\u2202i4 X b4\n\u01eb\n\u2192\n4!\n\u00012\n1 i1 ...i4\n\u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 X b2 ...\u2202i4 X b4\n\u01eb\n+\n3!\n\u00012\n1 i1 ...i4\n+\n\u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 As \u2202i3 X b3 \u2202i4 X b4\n\u01eb\n2!\n\n\u00012\n+ \u01ebi1 ...i4 \u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 As \u2202i3 At \u2202i4 X b4\n\u00012\n+ \u01ebi1 ...i4 \u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 As \u2202i3 At \u2202i4 Au\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the index b is used to denote the non compactified directions.\nFor the terms quadratic on the momenta to the\nantisymmetric field Bij we obtain similar terms,\nthe connection 1-forms Ar replaces the corresponding terms where the compactified coordinates appear. In the same way the momenta \u03a0 r\nreplaces the conjugate momenta of the compactified coordinates. That is, in the dual formulation\n(with the additional canonical transformation we\nmentioned above) the compactified coordinates\nare replaced by the connection 1-forms Ar . However, it is clear from the dual formulation that Ar\nmay have non trivial transitions of a very specific\nform over a nontrivial bundle. This fact is difficult to realize in terms of the original maps from\nthe world volume to the compactified directions\nof the target space.\n4. The noncommutative formulation\nWe now introduce a symplectic 2-form in the\nprevious formulation. We take\nFij d\u03c3 i \u2227 d\u03c3 j\n\n(31)\n\nwhere Fij is the curvature of the connection 1form which minimize the hamiltonian of the theory. For the D=11 Supermembrane we obtained\n\u2217 F = n,\n\ni, j = 1, 2\n\n(32)\n\nas discussed before.\nFor the D=10 Super 4D-brane we obtain\nF \u221d \u2217F\n\n(33)\n\n\u2217 (F \u2227 F ) \u221d n\n\n(34)\n\nover the 4 dimensional spatial world volume.\nThese are two of the dual solutions introduced\nin [31] and explained in section 2.\nThe procedure to obtain the symplectic noncommutative formulation for the double compactified D=11 Supermembrane was explicitly introduced in [30]. We will now obtain a similar formulation for the 4 D-brane in 10 dimensions.\n\n\f5\n\u00032\n1 \u0002 i1 ...i4\n\u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 X b2 ...\u2202i4 X b4\n\u01eb\n3!\n\u00032\n1 \u0002\nDr X b2 .{X b3 , X b4 }\n\u2192\n3!\n\nThe approach uses the symplectic 2-forms previously introduced to obtain a description of the\ntheory in terms of symplectic connections over a\nsymplectic fibration.\nWe consider the metric W ij defined by\nW ij \u2261 \u03a0\u0302ir \u03a0\u0302jr\n\n\u00032\n1 \u0002 i1 ...i4\n\u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 As \u2202i3 X b3 \u2202i4 X b4\n\u01eb\n2!\n\u00032\n1 \u0002\n\u2192\nFrs .{X b3 , X b4 }\n2!\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\n\u03a0\u0302ir\n\nij\n\n\u2261 F \u2202j \u00c2r\n\n(36)\n\n\u0002\n\n\u01ebi1 ...i4 \u2202i1 Ar \u2202i2 As \u2202i3 At \u2202i4 X b4\n\u0002\n\u00032\n\u2192 Frs Dt X b }\n\nij\n\nThe metric W is taken to be the metric over the\nspatial world volume for which F ij satisfies the\nduality conditions. \u03a0\u0302ir is a well defined vielbein.\n(36) defines \u00c2r .\nWe then introduce the following Poisson\nbracket over the world volume\n{B, C} \u2261 F ij \u2202i B\u2202j C\n\n(37)\n\nIt satisfies the Jacobi identity\n{{A, B}, C} + {{C, A}, B} + {{B, C}, A}\n\u0001\n= F kl F ij + F jl F ki + F il F jk\n.Dl (\u2202i A\u2202j B\u2202k C)\n\nklij\n\n\u01eb\n= k \u221a Dl (\u2202i A\u2202j B\u2202k C) = 0\nW\n\n(38)\n\nWhere Dl denotes the covariant derivative with\nrespect to the metric W ij .

They may be rewritten in terms of the\nbracket (37), the covariant derivative and the curvature Frs .\nThe expression for the double compactified\nD=11 Supermembrane was [30]:\nZ\nZ\n1 \u0002 M 2\n\u221a\n(P ) + (\u03a0 r )2\nH=\nH=\n\u03a3 2 W\n\u03a3\n1\n+ W {X M , X N }2 + W (Dr X M )2\n2\n\u0015 Z \u0014\n1\n1\u221a\n2\n+ W (Frs ) +\nW n2\n2\n\u03a3 8\n\u0001\u0003\n\u2212\u039b Dr \u03a0 r + {X M , PM }\n(47)\n\nThe geometrical interpretation of the above formulation (47) was given in [30] in terms of symplectic fibrations and connection 1-form over it.\nWe have shown here that the same geometrical\ndescription may be given for the 4 D-brane. We\nwill discuss it in more detail shortly. Before then,\nwe would like to remark that there is a natural\ndeformation of the above formulations in terms\nof the Moyal bracket. Let us see how this deformation may be realized preserving the symplectic\nstructure on the fibration, for the case of the double compactified Supermembrane.\nWe replace in (47) the Poisson bracket\n{B, C} = F ij \u2202i B\u2202j C\n\n(48)\n\n\f6\nby the Moyal bracket {, }M . (48) is the first term\nin the expansion of the Moyal bracket. We notice\nthat under the gauge transformation generated\nby the first class constraint\n\u03b4X M = {\u03be, X M }\n\n(49)\n\n\u03b4Ar = \u2212Dr \u03be = \u2212 (Dr \u03be + {Ar , \u03be}M )\n\n(50)\n\n\u03b4Dr X M = {\u03be, Dr X M }M\n\n(51)\n\nThese properties ensure that the hamiltonian\ndensity transform as\n\u03b4H = {\u03be, H}M\n\n(52)\n\nThe integral over a compact world volume renders the canonical lagrangian invariant under the\ngauge transformations.\nWe notice that the physical degrees of freedom\nof both theories, the double compactified D=11\nSupermembrane (47) and its Moyal deformation,\nare exactly the same. Moreover it can be shown\nthat there is a one to one correspondence, in the\nsense of Kontsevich, between both theories.\nIn [30] a geometrical description of the symplectic non commutative gauge theory was introduced. The same geometrical interpretation may\nbe used to describe its deformation in terms of the\nMoyal bracket and the compactified 4 D-brane we\nhave discussed.\nWe consider a symplectic fibration with base\nmanifold the spatial world volume, which is a\nclosed (without boundary) manifold. Over the\nfibration we consider the (infinite dimensional)\nPoisson bracket of the sections X M (\u03c3), PM (\u03c3):\n[X M (\u03c3), PM (\u03c3 \u2032 )] = \u03b4(\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 )\n\n(53)\n\nThis Poisson structure is preserved under the\ntransition maps of the fibration. These maps are\ndefined by\n\u03b4X M = {\u03be, X M }\n\n(54)\n\n\u03b4PM = {\u03be, PM }\n(55)\nT\nover U\u03b1 U\u03b2 , U\u03b1 is a covering of the base manifold. We notice that the transformation maps are\ndefined in terms of the (finite dimensional) Poisson bracket or Moyal bracket over the world volume, and they preserve the (infinite dimensional)\n\nPoisson bracket on the fibration. Ar define a symplectic connection over the fibration. That is, the\nPoisson bracket on the fibration is preserved under the holonomy generated by Ar .\nThe three theories we have discussed, the\ndouble compactified D=11 Supermembrane, its\nMoyal deformation and the compactified 4 Dbrane all admit the same geometrical interpretation. They describe the dynamics of a symplectic\nconnection over a symplectic fibration.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe formulated the double compactified D=11\nSupermembrane and the compactified Super 4\nD-brane in terms of a symplectic noncommutative gauge theory. We constructed a deformation of the compactified D=11 Supermembrane\nin terms of the Moyal brackets. There exist a one\nto one correspondence between both theories in\nthe sense of Kontsevich. A unified geometrical\ndescription of these theories was given in terms\nof a symplectic fibration over the world volume\nand the dynamics of symplectic connections over\nit. We hope the analysis for the D=10 4D-brane\nmay be extended to describe the M5-brane in 11\ndimension. Once that formulation is available we\nmay start analysing the corresponding quantum\nfield theory. We hope to report on that shortly.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. A. Connes, M. R. Douglas, and A.
