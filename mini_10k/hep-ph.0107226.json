They offer the\nmost direct method to determine the weak mixing angles and to probe strong interaction\nconfinement phenomenology of hadronic transitions. Recently Vcb has been determined from\nsemileptonic B decays and becomes the third most accurately measured Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa (CKM) matrix element [1]. CLEO Collaborations [2] have made measurments of the\ndecays B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 l+ \u03bd and \u03c1\u2212 l+ \u03bd with the results\nB(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 l+ \u03bd) = (1.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\u22124\nB(B 0 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 l+ \u03bd) = (2.57 \u00b1 0.29+0.33\n\u22120.46 \u00b1 0.41) \u00d7 10\n\u22123\nand |Vub | = (3.25 \u00b1 0.14+0.21\n\u22120.29 \u00b1 0.55) \u00d7 10 .\n\nIt is known that extracting |Vub | from the measured decay rates require significant inputs from\ntheoretical estimations of the hadronic form factors which involve complex strong-interaction\ndynamics. With BaBar and Belle taking data, we are entering a new era of B physics.\nProspects for accurate measurement of these decay modes become excellent. We can foresee that the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7l\u03bd and \u03b7 \u2032 l\u03bd could be also observed at B factories in the near future.\nIn this Brief Report, we study the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7l\u03bd and \u03b7 \u2032 l\u03bd to show that many interesting\nphysical observables can be extracted from measurments of these decays.\nAmplitudes of exclusive semileptonic B \u2192 P l\u03bd (l = \u03bc, e and P = \u03c0, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) can be written\nas\nGF\nM(B \u2192 P l\u03bd) = \u221a Vub  \u0304l\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd hP (pP )|\u016b\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )b|B(pB )i,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the hadronic transition matrix can be parameterized as\nhP (pP )|\u016b\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )b|B(pB )i = F+B\u2192P (q 2 )(pB + pP )\u03bc + F\u2212B\u2192P (q 2 )(pB \u2212 pP )\u03bc .\n\n(2)\n\nB\u2192P 2\nHere, q = pB \u2212 pP , and F+(\u2212)\n(q ) are the relevant form factors.

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the calculations of F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ) with various theoretical\napproaches: quark models [3], QCD sum rules [4, 5] and lattice QCD [6, 7]. Combining the\nresults of different approaches, say, predictions of QCD sum rules in low q 2 region and of lattice\nQCD in high q 2 region, we could possibly obtain a good theoretical description of F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ) in\nthe whole q 2 region. However, both QCD sum rule and lattice calculations of the form factors\n(\u2032)\n\nF+B\u2192\u03b7 (q 2 ) are not yet available in the literature. Therefore, we will use SU(3)F symmetry to\nrelate them to F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ). For \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing, we adopt the scheme [8, 9, 10]\n|\u03b7i = cos \u03c6|\u03b7q i \u2212 sin \u03c6|\u03b7s i,\n|\u03b7 \u2032 i = sin \u03c6|\u03b7q i + cos \u03c6|\u03b7s i,\n\n(4)\n\n\u221a\n \u0304\nwhere |\u03b7q i = (u\u016b + dd)/\n2, |\u03b7s i = ss\u0304, and \u03c6 = 39.3\u25e6 is the fitted mixing angle [9]. Assuming\n(\u2032)\n\nSU(3)F symmetry, the form factors F+B\u2192\u03b7 (q 2 ) are related to F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ) by the relations\n\u2032\n\nF+B\u2192\u03b7 (q 2 ) = sin \u03c6 F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ).\n\nF+B\u2192\u03b7 (q 2 ) = cos \u03c6 F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ),\n\n(5)\n\nThe form factor F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ) is known to be dominated by B \u2217 pole in the small\u2013recoil region\n\u221a\nq 2 \u223c (mB \u2212 m\u03c0 )2 and to scale as F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 \u2243 m2B ) \u223c mB in the heavy quark limit [11]. Recent\nstudies [7, 12, 13] imply the dipole behavior for F+ (q 2 ) in the large\u2013recoil region q 2 \u223c 0.

Averging predictions from Lattice QCD and LCSR, we obtain\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7l\u03bd) = (4.32 \u00b1 0.83) \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 l\u03bd) = (2.10 \u00b1 0.40) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n(13)\n\nWe note that the ratios R1 and R2 are independent of the value of F+B\u2192\u03c0 (0), but very\n\nsensitive to the details of its q 2 dependence. We also note that to give the same numerical\n\npredictions for B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, the F+B\u2192\u03c0 (0) for dipole parameterization should be smaller than\nthat for BK parameterization. If the same value F+B\u2192\u03c0 (0) is used in both BK and dipole\nparameterizations, one will find\nR3 =\n\nBdipole (B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 l\u03bd)\n= 3.13,\nBLCSR (B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 l\u03bd)\n\n(14)\n\nwhich implies that the dipole form factor will overestimate the decay rates because \u03c0 meson is\nvery light and the lepton pair invariant mass q 2 can be very near the Bu\u2217 pole. Therefore, theoretical predictions for B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd (and B \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd in turn) are very sensitive to the q 2 dependence\n\nof F+B\u2192\u03c0 (q 2 ). It is well known that the extraction of Vub from decay rates of B \u2192 \u03c0(\u03c1)l\u03bd suffers\nfrom large theoretical uncertainities in the hadronic form factors. Testing the predictions and\neventual measurements of d\u0393/dq 2 can provide valuable information on the hadronic form factors\ngoverning b \u2192 ul\u03bd decays, and hence lead to a reliable determination of Vub . With much more\ndata to arrive soon from B factories, the q 2 and the lepton energy distributions can be precisely\n\nmeasured and be used to distinguish these form factor parameterizations, and to extract Vub .\nThe determination of Vub from B \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd would represent a powerful method complementary\nto the determination of Vub from other exclusive decay modes, e.g., from B \u2192 \u03c0(\u03c1)l\u03bd.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the q 2 distributions and the lepton energy El distributions of the decays\n\nB \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd, where we have normlized the form factors to give B(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 l\u03bd) = 9 \u00d7 10\u22125 . We\nfind that both LCSR and Lattice QCD predict very consistent lepton energy distributions as\nwell as consistent decay rates for the decays. Integrating out the lepton energy in Eq.

So the ratios R4 and R5 can be safely\nextrapolated to few GeV2 to make the phase spaces sizable. Once the ratios are measured,\n(\u2032)\n\nthey can be used to extract the form factor F+B\u2192\u03b7 (0) and the mixing angle \u03c6 from the above\nrelations.\nIn the literature, semileptonic decays Ds \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032)l\u03bd have been taken as sources of extracting\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle and testing the mixing schemes [9, 17]. We note that the decays Ds \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )l\u03bd\ninvolve strange contents |\u03b7s i of \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032), and B \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032)l\u03bd involve non-strange contents |\u03b7q i of\n\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ), therefore B \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )l\u03bd and Ds \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )l\u03bd could provide combined testing of \u03b7 \u2212\u03b7 \u2032 mixing\nscheme.\nAs it is well known that \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are too complicated objects to be reliably described within\n(\u2032)\n\nQCD yet, it may be very hard to calculate the transition form factors F+B\u2192\u03b7 (q 2 ) within the\nframeworks of lattice QCD and QCD sum rules. The experimental extraction of those form\nfactors will improve our theorectical understanding of many interesting nonleptonic B decay\nmodes involving \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , and might shed light on the problem, currently under discussion [18],\nof the puzzling large branching ratios of B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 observed by CLEO [19].\n\nFinally, we note a few experimental comments: Background for B \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd would be much\n\nsmaller than that of B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, due to much lower multiplicity, since the random background\ncaused by B \u2192 \u03b7X is about an order of magnitude smaller than that by B \u2192 \u03c0X. The\nreconstruction of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in experimental analyses may be much easier than \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, even\n\nthough the signal/noise ratio is worse, because the mass of \u03b7 is much bigger than that of \u03c0 0 .\nAnd we could even require the momentum of \u03b7 to be bigger than 1 GeV to remove combinatorial\nbackgrounds substantially.\nTo conclude, we studied semileptonic decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd, which can be used to extract the\n6\n\n\fhadronic form factors of B meson decays to \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) and the angle of \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing. The branching\nratios are found to be B(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) l\u03bd) = 4.32 \u00b1 0.83 (2.10 \u00b1 0.40) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank G. Cvetic, Hongjoo Kim and Y.J.
