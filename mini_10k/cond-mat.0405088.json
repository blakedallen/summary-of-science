The ln(1/T ) dependence of \u03c1ab is robust even in the stripe-ordered state.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMagnetic fields can tune the electronic state of\nstrongly-correlated electron systems. It is well-known\nthat magnetic fields strongly affect the superconducting\nproperties as well as the normal-state ones. For conventional superconductors, the superconducting transition\ncurve in magnetic fields shifts to the low-temperature\nside in parallel with increasing field, which is attributed\nto the small superconducting fluctuation originating from\nthe large superconducting coherence length. (This is\ncalled a parallel shift.) For the high-Tc cuprates, on\nthe other hand, the superconducting transition curve\nshows a so-called fan-shape broadening in the underdoped regime, [1, 2] which is attributed to the large\nsuperconducting fluctuation originating from the small\nsuperconducting coherence length and the quasi-twodimensional superconductivity.\nAs for magnetic-field effects on the normal-state properties, some interesting behaviors of the normal-state\nelectrical resistivity at low temperatures below the superconducting transition temperature Tc have been found\nthrough the destruction of the superconductivity by\nthe application of magnetic field. In the underdoped\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO), for example, the in-plane resistivity, \u03c1ab , in the normal state exhibits an insulating\nbehavior at low temperatures, diverging in proportion to\nln(1/T ), though the origin of the ln(1/T ) dependence has\nnot been clarified. [3, 4] The ln(1/T ) dependence has also\nbeen observed in the underdoped Bi2 Sr2\u2212x Lax CuO6+\u03b4\n\n(BSLCO) below p (the hole concentration per Cu) \u223c\n0.12, [5] suggesting that the ln(1/T ) dependence may be\na common feature of \u03c1ab in the normal state of the underdoped high-Tc cuprates at low temperatures.\nRecently, magnetic-field effects on the charge-spin\nstripe order [6, 7] have also attracted great interest.\nElastic neutron scattering measurements in magnetic\nfields for LSCO with x = 0.10 (Ref. [8]) under the\northorhombic mid-temperature (OMT) structure (space\ngroup: Bmab) have revealed that the intensity of the incommensurate magnetic peaks around (\u03c0, \u03c0) in the reciprocal lattice space increases with increasing field parallel\nto the c-axis, suggesting the stabilization of the magnetic order. For LSCO with x = 0.12, on the other\nhand, the enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic\npeaks is observable but small. [9] The magnetic order\nis considered to be almost stabilized even in zero field\nfor x \u223c 1/8, [10, 11] so that the development of the\nmagnetic order by the application of magnetic field is\nslight. The enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic peaks has also been observed for the excess-oxygen\ndoped La2 CuO4+\u03b4 (LCO) with the stage-4 and state-6\nstructures. [12, 13] For La1.6\u2212x Nd0.4 Srx CuO4 (LNSCO)\nwith x = 0.15 where the charge-spin stripe order is stabilized under the tetragonal low-temperature (TLT) structure (space group: P42 /ncm), on the contrary, field effects on neither the charge nor magnetic peaks associated\nwith the charge-spin stripe order have been observed up\nto 7 T. [14] These results suggest that a sort of spin\nstripe order in the OMT phase of LSCO and in LCO is\n\n\f2\n100\n\nT [K]\n\n80\n\nKoike et al.\nSuzuki et al.\n\nCrawford La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4\net al.\n\nLa2-xBaxCuO4\n\nPresent\nwork\n\nPresent\nwork\n\n60\n\nOMT\nTd2\n\nTd2\n\nOMT\n\nPccn\n\n40\n\nTLT\n\nTLT\n20\n\nTc\n\nTc\n0\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n0.10\n\nx (Ba)\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16 0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\nx (Sr)\n\nFIG. 1: (left) Phase diagram of La2\u2212x Bax CuO4 .

Open triangles\nrepresent the temperature between the Pccn and TLT phases.\nClosed circles and squares in the both diagrams represent the\npresent Tc and Td2 estimated from the \u03c1ab measurements,\nrespectively.\n\nstabilized by the application of magnetic field, while the\ncharge-spin stripe order in the TLT phase of LNSCO is\nalmost never affected.\nIn this paper, with the aim to clarify the relation between the superconducting and normal-state properties\nand the formation of the stripe order, we have performed\n\u03c1ab measurements in magnetic fields up to 15 T for the\nsingle-crystal La2\u2212x Bax CuO4 (LBCO) with x = 0.08,\n0.10, 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12. As shown in\nFig. 1, it is noted that both LNSCO with x = 0.12\nand LBCO with x = 0.11 are located in the regime\nwhere the superconductivity is suppressed in the neighborhood of p = x = 1/8, while LBCO with x = 0.08\nis located outside this regime. LBCO with x = 0.10\nis just at the boundary between the inside and outside\nof this regime. In the elastic neutron scattering measurements of LBCO [18] and LNSCO [6, 7], the incommensurate elastic charge and magnetic peaks associated\nwith the stripe order have been observed for x = 0.10\nand 0.12 below the structural phase transition temperature between the OMT and TLT/Pccn phases, Td2 , in\nzero field, but not for x = 0.08. These mean that the\nstatic charge-spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures below Td2 for x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12 even in zero\nfield. Moreover, it has been found that the intensity of\nthe elastic charge peaks is weaker in x = 0.10 than in\nx \u223c 1/8 of LBCO, [18, 19] suggestive of a less-stabilized\nstatic charge order in x = 0.10. For x = 0.08, on the\nother hand, the stripe order is not stabilized even at low\ntemperatures.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nSingle crystals of LBCO with x = 0.08, 0.10, 0.11 and\nLNSCO with x = 0.12 were grown by the travelingsolvent floating-zone method under flowing O2 gas of\n4 bar. The detailed procedures are described elsewhere. [20] Ba and Sr contents of each crystal were analyzed by the inductively-coupled-plasma (ICP) measurements. The \u03c1ab was measured by the standard dc fourprobe method on field cooling in magnetic fields parallel\nto the c-axis up to 15 T.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 2 displays the temperature dependence of \u03c1ab\nin various magnetic fields for LBCO with x = 0.08, 0.10,\n0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12. For x = 0.10, 0.11 and\n0.12, a jump in \u03c1ab is observed at Td2 \u223c 41 K, \u223c 51 K\nand \u223c 67 K with decreasing temperature, respectively.\nFor x = 0.08, no jump is observed, suggesting that no\nstructural transition to the TLT phase occurs and that\nthe OMT phase remains at least down to the lowest measured temperature of 1.5 K. [18]\nFocusing the attention on the superconducting transition curve, the broadening is observed with increasing\nfield for x = 0.08, as usually observed in the underdoped\nhigh-Tc cuprates. For x = 0.11, on the other hand, it\nis found that the superconducting transition curve shifts\nto the low-temperature side in parallel with increasing\nfield. [21] To be more visible, contour maps of \u03c1ab in\nthe H vs T plane are shown in Fig. 3 for LBCO with\nx = 0.08, 0.10 and 0.11. In each x, the region where the\ncolor starts to change from that at high temperatures of\n\u223c 60 K with decreasing temperature roughly corresponds\nto the onset region of the superconducting transition. For\nx = 0.08, it is found that the relatively sharp transition\nof \u03c1ab around Tc in zero field is broadened with increasing field. For x = 0.11, on the contrary, the transition\nof \u03c1ab around Tc remains sharp even in magnetic fields.\nThe parallel shift of \u03c1ab is also observed for x = 0.12 in\nLNSCO as shown in Fig. 2. These suggest an intimate\nrelation between the parallel shift and the suppression of\nsuperconductivity around p = 1/8 or the formation of\nthe charge-spin stripe order.\nA remarkable feature is for x = 0.10 that the superconducting transition curve shows the broadening in low\nfields, while it changes to the parallel shift in high fields\nabove 9 T. In Fig. 3, it is found that the broad transition of \u03c1ab around Tc below 9 T changes to the sharp one\nabove 9 T for x = 0.10. This dramatic change indicates\nthat the application of magnetic field causes a crossover\nfrom the usual state of the underdoped high-Tc cuprates\nto the peculiar state around p = 1/8.\nAnother remarkable feature observed for x = 0.10\nis that the normal-state-like behavior of \u03c1ab , characterized by the almost linear T -dependence, is observed between Td2 and the onset temperature of superconductiv-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity, \u03c1ab , in various magnetic fields parallel to\nthe c-axis for La2\u2212x Bax CuO4 with x = 0.08, 0.10, 0.11 and La1.6\u2212x Nd0.4 Srx CuO4 with x = 0.12.

For\nx = 0.11 and 0.12, on the other hand, the increase of \u03c1ab\nbetween Td2 and Tconset with increasing field is negligibly small up to 15 T, compared with that for x = 0.10.\nTo be summarized, LBCO with x = 0.08 is a typical\nunderdoped sample characterized by the broadening of\n\nthe superconducting transition curve in magnetic fields.\nBoth LBCO with x = 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12\nare peculiar samples around p = 1/8 characterized by the\nparallel shift of the superconducting transition curve in\nmagnetic fields.

It\nis well-known that the broadening of the superconducting transition curve observed for x = 0.08 is charac-\n\nteristic of the underdoped high-Tc cuprates with large\nsuperconducting fluctuation. [1, 2] On the other hand,\nthe parallel shift of the superconducting transition curve\nis observed for x = 0.11 and 0.12 and for x = 0.10\nabove 9 T. The parallel shift has also been observed\nin LNSCO with x = 0.15 (Ref. [14]) and LSCO with\nx = 0.12 (Ref. [22]) where the static stripe order of\ncharges and/or spins is formed at low temperatures.\nThese suggest that both the superconductivity with small\nsuperconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order\nare realized in one sample. Here, it is an important issue whether the superconducting region and the static\nstripe-ordered one coexist microscopically or are separated macroscopically. From the neutron scattering measurements in La1.875 Ba0.125\u2212x Srx CuO4 , the static stripe\norder has been suggested to compete with the superconductivity. [23] Moreover, from the muon-spin-relaxation\nmeasurements in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4 around x = 1/8,\nit has been suggested that the superconductivity is destroyed in a region where frequencies of the dynamical\nstripe fluctuations are lower than \u223c 1011 Hz. [24] Therefore, the superconducting region and the static stripeordered one are probably separated macroscopically.\nThe reason why the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation is realized in a sample with the\nstatic stripe-ordered region is still an open question. A\npossible origin is that the out-of-plane superconducting\ncoherence length, \u03bec , might be relatively large under the\ninfluence of the correlation of the static stripe order along\nthe c-axis, [7, 25] leading to the three-dimensional superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation.\nNext, we discuss the relation between the change of\nthe normal-state behavior of \u03c1ab in magnetic fields and\nthe field-induced stripe order. Considering the results of\nthe elastic neutron scattering measurements [6, 7, 18, 19]\nmentioned in Sec. I, the negligibly small increase of \u03c1ab\nbelow Td2 with increasing field for x = 0.11 and 0.12\nseems to indicate that the stripe order is nearly perfectly\nstabilized in zero field and is insensitive to the applied\nfield. [14] As for x = 0.10, the marked increase of \u03c1ab\nbelow Td2 with increasing field reminds us some possible\norigins. The first is the normal-state magnetoresistance.\nHowever, this is not applicable, because the normal-state\nmagnetoresistance is usually as small as an order of 1 %\nat 15 T, as in the case of x = 0.11 and 0.12. The second is the suppression of the superconducting fluctuation\nby the applied field. The positive magnetoresistance appears even at temperatures just below Td2 far from Tconset\nin high fields. On the other hand, reports on the Nernst\neffect in LSCO have suggested that the vortex state survives even at higher temperatures far above Tc , meaning\nthat the superconducting fluctuation exists even at high\ntemperatures. [26, 27] Therefore, this possible origin cannot be excluded and further measurements are needed to\nconclude. Nevertheless, it appears that this is not a candidate, because the large positive magnetoresistance is\nobserved only for x = 0.10 and not for x = 0.11 nor 0.12.\nThe third is enhancement of the localization of holes in-\n\n\f5\nfor H \u2265 11 T, as seen in Fig. 2. The slope of the\nln(1/T ) dependence is found to increase with increasing x, indicating that the localization of holes becomes\nstrong with increasing x toward x = 1/8 at 15 T. The\nln(1/T ) dependence is known to be characteristic of the\nweak localization and the electron-electron interaction in\nthe two-dimensional Anderson-localized state where the\nin-plane electrical conductivity \u03c3ab actually changes in\nproportion to ln(1/T ) even in magnetic fields. [28] For\nx = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, however, \u03c3ab does not show the\nln(1/T ) dependence below Td2 , as in the case of the underdoped LSCO. [3, 4] Although the true origin of the\nln(1/T ) dependence of \u03c1ab is not clear, the localization\nof holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence observed widely in\nthe underdoped high-Tc cuprates is robust even in the\nstripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO. [29]\n\nV.\nFIG. 4: Plot of \u03c1ab vs lnT at 15 T for La2\u2212x Bax CuO4 (LBCO)\nwith x = 0.10, 0.11 and La1.6\u2212x Nd0.4 Srx CuO4 (LNSCO) with\nx = 0.12.\n\nduced by the applied field. The localization behavior of\n\u03c1ab becomes marked with increasing field and appears to\napproach the behavior of LNSCO with x = 0.12 where\nthe stripe order is perfectly stabilized. In the long run,\nthe most probable origin is that the charge-spin stripe\norder is stabilized by the applied field in x = 0.10. This\nmay be the first experimental evidence, to our knowledge,\nof the charge stripe order stabilized in magnetic fields. To\nbe more conclusive, the neutron scattering measurements\nin magnetic fields are under way.\nFinally, we discuss the temperature dependence of \u03c1ab\nbelow Td2 . So far, it has been clarified in the underdoped\nLSCO and BSLCO [3, 4, 5] that \u03c1ab in the normal state\nshows the ln(1/T ) dependence at low temperatures in\nmagnetic fields, suggesting that the ln(1/T ) dependence\nis a common feature of the underdoped high-Tc cuprates.\nTo check this suggestion, \u03c1ab 's of LBCO with x = 0.10,\n0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 at 15 T are plotted versus lnT , as shown in Fig. 4. Below \u223c 20 K, it is found\nthat \u03c1ab in the normal state is proportional to ln(1/T ) in\neach x, though \u03c1ab deviates downward from ln(1/T ) at\nlow temperatures because of the superconducting transition for x = 0.10 and 0.11. The small deviation below 3\nK for x = 0.12 is irrelevant to the superconducting transition, because \u03c1ab is independent of the field strength\n\n[1] K. Kitazawa, S. Kambe, M. Naito, I.

These suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation\nand the static stripe order are realized in one sample for\nx = 0.11 and 0.12. For LBCO with x = 0.10, the broadening in low fields changes to the parallel shift in high\nfields above 9 T. Moreover, \u03c1ab in the normal state below Td2 increases with increasing field up to 15 T. It is\npossible that these pronounced features of x = 0.10 are\nunderstood in terms of the field-induced stabilization of\nthe charge stripe order. The \u03c1ab in the normal state at\nlow temperatures has been found to be proportional to\nln(1/T ) for x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, suggesting the localization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence of \u03c1ab\nwhich is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO\nand LNSCO.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe high magnetic field experiments were partly supported by the High Field Laboratory for Superconducting Materials (HFLSM), Institute for Materials Research,\nTohoku University.
