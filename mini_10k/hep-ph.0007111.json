As these heavy mesons have a small size it has been expected\nthat hadronic cross sections may be calculated relying on perturbative QCD. The study of\ncharmonium production became even more intense after charmonium suppression had been\nsuggested as a probe for the creation and interaction of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic\nheavy ion collisions [1].\nSince we will never have direct experimental information on charmonium-nucleon total\ncross sections one has to extract it from other data for example from elastic photoproduction\nof charmonia \u03b3p \u2192 J/\u03c8(\u03c8 \u2032 ) p . The widespread believe that one can rely on the vector\ndominance model (VDM) is based on previous experience the with photoproduction of \u03c1\nmesons. However, even a dispersion approach shows that this is quite a risky way, because\nthe J/\u03c8 pole in the complex Q2 plane is nearly 20 times farther away from the physical region\nthan the \u03c1 pole. The multichannel analysis performed in [2] demonstrates that the corrections\nJ/\u03c8 p\n\nare huge, \u03c3tot\n\nturns out to be more that three times larger than the VDM prediction.\n\nUnfortunately, more exact predictions of the multichannel approach, especially for \u03c8 \u2032 , need\nknowledge of many diagonal and off-diagonal amplitudes which are easily summed only if\none uses the oversimplified oscillator wave functions and a q q\u0304-proton cross section of the\nform \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT ) \u221d rT2 , where rT is the transverse q q\u0304 separation.\nInstead, one may switch to the quark basis, which should be equivalent to the hadronic\nJ/\u03c8 p\n\nbasis because of completeness. In this representation the procedure of extracting \u03c3tot\n\nfrom\n\nphotoproduction data cannot be realized directly, but has to be replaced by a different strategy. Namely, as soon as one has expressions for the wave functions of charmonia and the\nuniversal dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s), one can predict both, the experimentally known\nJ/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032 ) p\n\ncharmonium photoproduction cross sections and the unknown \u03c3tot\n\n. If the photopro-\n\nduction data are well described one may have some confidence in the predictions for the\nJ/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032 )p\n\n\u03c3tot\n\n. Of course this procedure will be model dependent, but we believe that this is the\n2\n\n\fbest use of photoproduction data one can presently make. This program was performed for\nthe first time in [3]. The aim of this paper is not to propose a conceptually new scheme, but\nto calculate within a given approach as accurately as possible and without any free parameters. Wherever there is room for arbitrariness, like forms for the color dipole cross section\nand those for for charmonium wave functions, we use and compare other author's proposals,\nwhich have been tested on data different from those used here.\nIn the light-cone dipole approach the two processes, photoproduction and charmoniumnucleon elastic scattering look as shown in Fig. 1 [3].

Correspondingly, \u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~rT ) is the light-cone wave function of J/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7 (only\nin Eq. 2). The dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) mediates the transition (cf Fig. 1).\n3\n\n\fIn Section 2 we review the status of the factorized light-cone approach to photoproduction\nof heavy quarkonia. Besides the well known distribution function of quarks in the photon, it\nneeds knowledge of the universal flavor independent dipole cross section which depends on\nthe transverse q\u0304q separation and energy. In Section 2.1 we introduce two parameterizations\navailable in the literature.\nMaking use of the nonrelativistic approximation for heavy quarkonia in Section 2.2 we\nsolve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with four types of relativistic potentials available in the\nliterature. The next most difficult step is a Lorentz boost to the infinite momentum frame\ndiscussed in Section 2.3. Although this procedure is ill defined and no unambiguous recipe is\nknown, we apply the standard and widely used one. We put a special emphasis on importance\nof the Melosh spin transformation, which turns out to be very important.\nThe final expression for the photoproduction cross sections is presented in Section 3.1\nand results are compared with available data for J/\u03c8 production in Section 3.2. Although\nthe calculations are parameter free they demonstrate a very good agreement with data.\nThe ratio of \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 photoproduction yields has drawn attention recently since previous\ncalculations grossly underestimate experimental values. It is demonstrated in Section 3.3\nthat the Melosh spin transformation which has been overlooked previously, and accompanies\nthe Lorentz boost may be the reason. It has a dramatic impact on the \u03c8 \u2032 photoproduction\nincreasing its yield by a factor 2 \u2212 3 in a good agreement with data.\nAfter we will have demonstrated that the approach under discussion quantitatively explains the photoproduction data, we calculate in Section 4 the total charmonium-nucleon\ncross sections for J/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7-s. We predict quite a steep energy dependence for these\ncross sections slightly varying for different charmonia. Although the cross sections correlate\nwith the mean charmonium size, this dependence is slower than \u221d hrT2 i, and this fact finds\na simple explanation. In Section 5 we compare our estimates for charmonium-nucleon cross\nsections with the effective absorption cross section of charmonium which can be extracted\nfrom data on nuclear attenuation of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 . Agreement is rather good.\n\n4\n\n\fOur results are summarized in Section 6 where we also discuss the physics of energy\ndependence of the cross sections and the status of our approach. Special attention is given\nto nuclear attenuation of charmonia which is affected by formation and coherence time\nphenomena in an important way.\n\n2\n\nLight-cone dipole formalism for virtual photoproduction of charmonia off nucleons\n\nThe light cone variable describing longitudinal motion which is invariant to Lorentz boosts\n+\n+\nis the fraction \u03b1 = p+\nc /p\u03b3 \u2217 of the photon light-cone momentum p\u03b3 \u2217 = E\u03b3 \u2217 + p\u03b3 \u2217 carried by\n\nthe quark or antiquark. In the nonrelativistic approximation (assuming no relative motion\nof c and c\u0304) \u03b1 = 1/2 (e.g. [3]), otherwise one should integrate over \u03b1 (see Eq. (1)).

Effects of the non-perturbative interaction within the q q\u0304 fluctuation\nare negligible for the heavy charmed quarks.\n5\n\n\fThe color dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) is poorly known from first principles. It is\nexpected to vanish \u221d rT2 at small rT \u2192 0 due to color screening [6] and to level off at\nlarge separations due to a finite range of gluon propagation. We employ phenomenological\napproaches described in section 2.1.\nThe charmonium wave function is well defined in the rest frame where one can rely on\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We present solutions for four potentials proposed in the literature\n(section 2.2). As soon as the rest frame wave function is known, one may be tempted to\napply the Lorentz transformation to the cc\u0304 pair as it would be a classical system and boost it\nto the infinite momentum frame. However, quantum effects are important and in the infinite\nmomentum frame a series of different Fock states emerges from the Lorentz boost. (Compare\nwith a Lorentz boost of a positronium: Weizs\u00e4ker-Williams photons appear.) Therefore the\nlowest |cc\u0304i component in the infinite momentum frame does not represent the |cc\u0304i in the\nrest frame. We rely on the widely used procedure for the generation of the light-cone wave\nfunctions of charmonia and describe it in section 2.3.\n\n2.1\n\nPhenomenological dipole cross section\n\nThe dipole formalism for hadronic interactions introduced in [6] expands the hadronic cross\nsection over the eigen states of the interaction which in QCD are the dipoles with a definite\ntransverse separation (see (1)). Correspondingly, the values of the dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT )\nfor different rT are the eigenvalues of the elastic amplitude operator. This cross section is\nflavor invariant, due to universality of the QCD coupling, and vanishes like \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT ) \u221d rT2 for\nrT \u2192 0. The latter property is sometimes referred to as color transparency.\nThe total cross sections for all hadrons and (virtual) photons are known to rise with energy. Apparently, the energy dependence cannot originate from the hadronic wave functions\nin Eqs. (1, 2), but only from the dipole cross section. In the approximation of two-gluon\nexchange used in [6] the dipole cross section is constant, the energy dependence originates\nfrom higher order corrections related to gluon radiation. On the other way, one can stay\n\n6\n\n\fwith two-gluon exchange, but involve higher Fock states which contain gluons in addition\nto the q q\u0304. Both approaches correspond to the same set of Feynman graphs. We prefer to\nintroduce energy dependence into \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) and not include higher Fock states into the wave\nfunctions.\nFor small size dipoles essential for DIS one may apply perturbative QCD and the energy\ndependence comes as an effect of of gluon radiation treated in the leading-log(1/x) approximation [7, 8]. In the opposite limit of large separations typical for light hadrons one can\nalso calculate the effects of gluon bremsstrahlung making use of smallness of the quark-gluon\ncorrelation radius [9].\nHowever, the intermediate case we are interested in, is the most complicated one as\nusual. No reliable way to sum up higher order corrections is known so far. Therefore we use\na phenomenological form which interpolates between the two limiting cases of small and large\nseparations. Few parameterizations are available in the literature, we choose two of them\nwhich are simple, but quite successful in describing data and denote them by the initials of\nthe authors as \"GBW\" [10] and \"KST\" [11].\nWe have\n\"GBW\":\n\nh\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni\n\n\u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , x) = 23.03 1 \u2212 e\u2212rT /r0 (x) mb ,\nr0 (x) = 0.4\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nx0\n\n\u00130.144\n\nfm ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere x0 = 3.04 * 10\u22124 . The proton structure function calculated with this parameterization\nfits very well all available data at small x and for a wide range of Q2 [10]. However, it\nobviously fails describing the hadronic total cross sections, since it never exceeds the value\n23.03 mb. The x-dependence guarantees Bjorken scaling for DIS at high Q2 , however, Bjorken\nx is not a well defined quantity in the soft limit. Instead we use the prescription of [12],\nx = (M\u03c82 + Q2 )/s, where M\u03c8 is the charmonium mass.\nThis problem as well as the difficulty with the definition of x have been fixed in [11].\n\u221a\nThe dipole cross section is treated as a function of the c.m. energy s, rather than x, since\n\u221a\ns is more appropriate for hadronic processes. A similarly simple form for the dipole cross\n7\n\n\fsection is used\n\"KST\":\n\nh\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni\n\n\u03c3q\u0304q (rT , s) = \u03c30 (s) 1 \u2212 e\u2212rT /r0 (s) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe values and energy dependence of hadronic cross sections is guaranteed by the choice of\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\ns 0.08\n3 r 2 (s)\n\u03c30 (s) = 23.6\n1 + 02\ns0\n8 hrch i\n\u0012 \u0013\u22120.14\ns\nfm .\nr0 (s) = 0.88\ns0\n\n!\n\nmb ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThe energy dependent radius r0 (s) is fitted to data for the proton structure function F2p (x, Q2 ),\n2\ns0 = 1000 GeV2 and the mean square of the pion charge radius hrch\ni = 0.44 fm2 . The im-\n\nprovement at large separations leads to a somewhat worse description of the proton structure function at large Q2 . Apparently, the cross section dependent on energy, rather than\nx, cannot provide Bjorken scaling. Indeed, parameterization (9) is successful only up to\nQ2 \u2248 10 GeV2 .\nIn fact, the cases we are interested in, charmonium production and interaction, are just\nin between the regions where either of these parameterization is successful. Therefore, we\nsuppose that the difference between predictions using Eq. (8) and (9) is a measure of the\ntheoretical uncertainty which fortunately turns out to be rather small.\nWe demontrate in Fig. 2 a few examples of rT2 -dependence of the dipole cross section\nat different energies for both parameterization. The KST cross section reveals a nontrivial\nbehavior, it rises with energy at rT < 3 f m2 , but decreases at larger separations. This is\n\u221a\nhowever a temporary effect, \u03c30 (s) reaches minimum at s \u2248 77 GeV and then slowly rises\nat higher energies. Such a peculiar behavior is a consequence of our original intention to\nhp\nreproduce the energy dependence of the hadronic cross sections \u03c3tot\n\u221d s0.08 keeping the form\n\n(9) of the cross section. Of course data are insensitive to the cross section at such large\nseparations.\nBoth GBW and KST cross section vanish \u221d rT2 at small rT , however considerably deviate\nfrom this simple behavior at large separations.

The equation for radial \u03a8(r) is solved with the help of the program\n[13]. The following four potentials V (r) have been used (see Fig. 3):\n\n9\n\n\f\u2022 \"COR\": Cornell potential [15],\nk\nr\nV (r) = \u2212 + 2\nr a\n\n(15)\n\nwith k = 0.52, a = 2.34 GeV\u22121 and mc = 1.84 GeV.\n\u2022 \"BT\": Potential suggested by Buchm\u00fcller and Tye [14] with mc = 1.48 GeV.

Note, however, that COR and\nPOW use mc \u2248 1.8 GeV, while BT and LOG use mc \u2248 1.5 GeV for the mass of the charmed\nquark. This difference will have significant consequences.\nThe results of calculations for the radial part \u03a8nl (r) of the 1S and 2S states are depicted in\nFig. 4. For the ground state all the potentials provide a very similar behavior for r > 0.3 fm,\nwhile for small r the predictions are differ by up to 30%. The peculiar property of the 2S\nstate wave function is the node at r \u2248 0.4 fm which causes strong cancelations in the matrix\nelements Eq. (1) and as a result, a suppression of photoproduction of \u03c8 \u2032 relative to J/\u03c8\n[3, 18].\n\n10\n\n\f1.5\n1.0\n\nV(r) [GeV]\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\nBT\nCOR\nLOG\nPOW\n\n-2.0\n-2.5\n-3.0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nr [fm]\nFigure 3: Shapes of the potentials V (r) for the four parameterizations employed\nin this paper.

This makes the problem of building the light-cone wave function for the lowest\n|cc\u0304i component difficult, no unambiguous solution is yet known. There are only recipes\nin the literature, a simple one widely used [19], is the following. One applies a Fourier\ntransformation from coordinate to momentum space to the known spatial part of the nonrelativistic wave function (14), \u03a8(~r ) \u21d2 \u03a8(~p ), which can be written as a function of the\neffective mass of the cc\u0304, M 2 = 4(p2 + m2c ), expressed in terms of light-cone variables\nM 2 (\u03b1, pT ) =\n\n11\n\np2T + m2c\n.\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(18)\n\n\f1.4\n\n1\nBT\nCOR\nLOG\nPOW\n\n1.2\n\nBT\nCOR\nLOG\nPOW\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a82S(r) [GeV3/2]\n\n\u03a81S(r) [GeV3/2]\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nr [fm]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nr [fm]\n\nFigure 4: The radial part of the wave function \u03a8nl (r) for the 1S and 2S states\ncalculated with four different potentials (see text).\n\nIn order to change integration variable pL to the light-cone variable \u03b1 one relates them via\nM, namely pL = (\u03b1 \u2212 1/2)M(pT , \u03b1).

The result is discouraging, since the \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 ratio of the photoproduction cross sections\nare far too low in comparison with data. However, the oversimplified dipole cross section\n\u03c3qq\u0304 (rT ) \u221d rT2 has been used, and what is even more essential, the important ingredient of\nLorentz transformations, the Melosh spin rotation, has been left out. The spin transformation has also been left out in the recent publication [21] which repeats the calculations of\n[20] with a more realistic dipole cross section which levels off at large separations. This leads\nto suppression of the node-effect (less cancelation) and enhancement of \u03a8\u2032 photoproduction.\n12\n\n\fNevertheless, the calculated \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 ratio is smaller than the data by a factor of two.\nThe 2-dimensional spinors \u03c7c and \u03c7c\u0304 describing c and c\u0304 respectively in the infinite momentum frame are known to be related via the Melosh rotation [22, 19] to the spinors \u03c7\u0304c\nand \u03c7\u0304c\u0304 in the rest frame:\nb\n\u03c7c = R(\u03b1,\n~pT ) \u03c7c ,\n\nb \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212~\n\u03c7c\u0304 = R(1\npT ) \u03c7c\u0304 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the matrix R(\u03b1, ~pT ) has the form:\nb\nR(\u03b1,\n~pT ) =\n\nmc + \u03b1 M \u2212 i [~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~n] ~pT\nq\n\n(mc + \u03b1 M)2 + p2T\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nSince the potentials we use in section 2.2 contain no spin-orbit term, the cc\u0304 pair is in\nS-wave. In this case spatial and spin dependences in the wave function factorize and we\narrive at the following light cone wave function of the cc\u0304 in the infinite momentum frame\n(\u03bc,\u03bc\u0304)\n\n\u03a6\u03c8\n\n(\u03b1, ~pT ) = U (\u03bc,\u03bc\u0304) (\u03b1, ~pT ) * \u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~pT ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nb\u2020\nb \u2217 (1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212~\nU (\u03bc,\u03bc\u0304) (\u03b1, ~pT ) = \u03c7\u03bc\u2020\npT ) ~\u03c3 * ~e\u03c8 \u03c3y R\npT ) \u03c3y\u22121 \u03c7e\u03bc\u0304c\u0304\nc R (\u03b1, ~\n\n(23)\n\nand \u03c7ec\u0304 is defined in (4).\n\nNote that the wave function (22) is different from one used in [23, 24, 25] where it was\n\nassumed that the vertex \u03c8 \u2192 cc\u0304 has the structure \u03c8\u03bc \u016b \u03b3\u03bc u like the for the photon \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 cc\u0304.\nThe rest frame wave function corresponding to such a vertex contains S wave and D wave.\nThe weight of the latter is dictated by the structure of the vertex and cannot be justified by\nany reasonable nonrelativistic potential model for the cc\u0304 interaction.\nNow we can determine the light-cone wave function in the mixed longitudinal momentum\n- transverse coordinate representation:\n(\u03bc,\u03bc\u0304)\n\u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~rT )\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(\u03bc,\u03bc\u0304)\n\nd2 ~pT e\u2212i~pT ~rT \u03a6\u03c8\n\n13\n\n(\u03b1, ~pT ) .\n\n(24)\n\n\fThe spatial component \u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~rT ) of Eq.

(33). The results for J/\u03c8 are compared with the data in Fig. 6. Calculations are\nperformed with GBW and KST parameterizations for the dipole cross section and for wave\nfunctions of the J/\u03c8 calculated from BT, LOG, COR and POW potentials. One observes\n\u2022 There are no major differences for the results using the GBW and KST parameterizations.\n\u2022 The use of different potentials to generate the wave functions of the J/\u03c8 leads to two\ndistinctly different behaviors. The potentials labeled BT and LOG (see sect. 2.2)\ndescribe the data very well, while the potentials COR and LOG underestimate them\nby a factor of two. The different behavior has been traced to the following origin: BT\nand LOG use mc \u2248 1.5 GeV, but COR and POW mc \u2248 1.8 GeV. While the bound\nstate wave functions of J/\u03c8 are little affected by this difference (see Fig. 4), the photon\nwave function Eq. (3) depends sensitively on mc via the argument Eq. (5) of the K0\nfunction.\nWe compare our calculations also with data for the Q2 dependence of the cross section.\n\u221a\n2\nThe data are plotted in Fig. 7 at c.m. energy s = 90 GeV as a function of Q2 + MJ/\u03c8\n, since\nin this form both, data and calculations display an approximate power law dependence. Such\n2\na dependence on Q2 +MJ/\u03c8\nis suggested by the variable \u01eb2 in Eq. (5), which for \u03b1 = 1/2 takes\n\nthe value Q2 + (2 mc )2 . It may be considered as an indication that \u03b1 = 1/2 is a reasonable\napproximation for the nonrelativistic charmonium wave function.\nOur results are depicted for BT and COR potentials and using GBW and KST cross\nsections. Agreement with the calculations based on BT potential is again quite good, while\nthe COR potential grossly underestimate the data at small Q2 . Although the GBW and KST\ndipole cross sections lead to nearly the same cross sections for real photoproduction, their\npredictions at high Q2 are different by a factor 2 \u22123.

To demonstrate these effects we present the results\n\u221a\nof our calculations at s = 90 GeV in Table 1.

Solid and dashed\ncurves are calculated with GBW and KST dipole cross sections, while thick and\nthin curves correspond to BT and COR potentials, respectively. Results obtained\nwith LOG and POW potentials are very close to that curves (LOG similar to BT\nand POW to COR, see also Fig. 6).\n\nthat these effects add 30-40% to the J/\u03c8 photoproduction cross section.\nThe spin rotation effects turn out to have a much more dramatic impact on \u03c8 \u2032 increasing\nthe photoproduction cross section by a factor 2-3. This is visible in the lower half of the\ntable which shows the ratio R = \u03c3(\u03c8 \u2032 )/\u03c3(J/\u03c8) of photoproduction cross sections, where the\nnumber in parenthesis correspond to no spin rotation effects included. This spin effects\nexplain the large values of the ratio R observed experimentally. Our results for R are about\ntwice as large as evaluated in [21] and even more than in [20].\nThe ratio of \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 photoproduction cross sections is depicted as function of c.m.\n\n18\n\n\fTable 1: The photoproduction \u03b3 p \u2192 J/\u03c8 p cross-section \u03c3(J/\u03c8) in nb and the\nratio R = \u03c3(\u03c8 \u2032 )/\u03c3(J/\u03c8) for the four different types of potentials (BT, LOG,\n2\nCOR, POW) and the three\n\u221a parameterizations (GBW, KST, rT ) for the dipole\ncross section \u03c3(rT , s) at s = 90 GeV.

Remarkably, the ratio R(s) rises with energy. This result is in\nvariance with the naive expectation based on the larger size of the \u03c8 \u2032 and on the usual rule:\nthe smaller the size of the q q\u0304 dipole, the steeper its energy dependence. There is, however,\nno contradiction, since this is another manifestation of the node in the wave function of \u03c8 \u2032 .\nIndeed, as function of energy mostly the short distance part of the dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT )\nrises. It enhances the positive contribution for distances shorter than the node position in\nthe \u03c8 \u2032 wave function. Therefore, with increasing energy the cancelation in the amplitude of\n\u03c8 \u2032 production is reduced. This effect leads to a steeper energy dependence of \u03c8 \u2032 production\ncompared to J/\u03c8.

Note that this\nsituation is specific for photoproduction because the nodeless wave function of the photon is\nprojected to the sign changing wave function of \u03c8 \u2032 . This should not happen in the case of\nelastic J/\u03c8(\u03a8\u2032)-p scattering (see below).\nSimilarly of the node effect leads to a rising Q2 -dependence of the \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 ratio in the\nphotoproduction cross sections.

However the\n\u221a\npredicted cross sections at s = 10 GeV for \u03c7c (m = 0), \u03c7c (m = 1) and \u03c8 \u2032 are about twice\nas large as ours. We believe that the disagreement originates from the too rough nonperturbative dipole cross section1 used in [40] which was not well adjusted to data. Even the\npion-nucleon cross section calculated with Eq. (1) in [40] overestimates the experimental\nvalue by factor 1.5.\nAlthough all four potentials are presented, comparison with photoproduction data in\nFigs. 6 and 7 show that two of them, BT and LOG potentials, are more trustable at least for\nJ/\u03c8. These two potentials again give very close predictions for J/\u03c8-p total cross sections but\nthe deviation from the predictions with the two other potentials, COR and POW, is much\nsmaller than in the case of photoproduction.\nNote that the cross sections calculated with the GBW parameterization demonstrate\na tendency to level off at very high energy, especially for \u03c8 \u2032 , as compared to the KST\npredictions. The reason is obvious: the GBW cross sections approach the universal limit\n\u03c3max = \u03c30 = 23.03 mb. This cannot be true, and the KST parameterization is more reliable\nthan GBW at high energies where the gluon cloud surrounding the c\u0304c pair becomes nearly\nas big as light hadrons.\nAccording to Figs. 10 and 11 for the KST parameterization the total cross sections of\n\u221a\ncharmonia are nearly straight lines as function of s in a double logarithmic representation,\nthough with significantly different slopes for the different states. Therefore a parameterization in the form\n\u03c3 \u03c8p (s) = \u03c30\u03c8 *\n1\n\n\u0012\n\ns\ns0\n\n\u0013\u2206\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\nwe are thankful to Lars Gerland who provided us with the expression for the dipole cross section used\n\nin [40].\n\n24\n\n\fseems appropriate, at least within a restricted energy interval. We use the data shown in\nFigs. 10 and 11 for the KST parameterization of \u03c3qq\u0304 and for the BT and LOG potentials and\nfit the them by the form (42) with s0 = 1000 GeV.

The exponent \u2206 which governs the energy dependence decreases monotonically with\nthe size of the charmonium state, demonstrating the usual correlation between the dipole size\nand the steepness of energy dependence. The values of \u2206 are larger than in soft interactions\nof light hadrons (\u223c 0.08), but smaller than values reached in DIS at high Q2 .\n\u221a\nOur results at s = 10 GeV (the mean energy of charmonia produced in the NA38/NA50\nexperiments at SPS, CERN),\nJ/\u03c8 \u221a\n\u03c3tot ( s = 10 GeV ) = 3.56 \u00b1 0.08 mb ,\n\u03c8\u2032 \u221a\n( s = 10 GeV ) = 12.19 \u00b1 0.61 mb ,\n\u03c3tot\n\n25\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\n\fwell agree with the cross sections extracted in [2] from photoproduction data employing\nJ/\u03c8 \u221a\nthe two-channel approximation, 2.8 \u00b1 0.12 mb < \u03c3tot ( s = 10 GeV ) < 4.1 \u00b1 0.15 mb and\n\u2032\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\n\u03c8\n/\u03c3tot \u2248 3.75 (having poorly controlled accuracy), which shows that the two channel\n\u03c3tot\n\napproach is a reasonable tool to analyze photoproduction data.\nJ/\u03c8 \u221a\nThe cross section Eq. (42)) with the parameters in Table 2 agrees well with \u03c3tot ( s =\n\n20 GeV ) = 4.4 \u00b1 0.6 mb obtained in the model of the stochastic vacuum [41].\nIt worth noting that the results for charmonium-nucleon total cross sections are amazingly\nsimilar to what one could get without any spin rotation,\n\u03c8N\n(s)\n\u03c3tot\n\n\u2248\n\nZ1\n\nd\u03b1\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nd2~rT |\u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~rT )|2 \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u03c8 (\u03b1, ~rT ) is related by Fourier transformation to Eq.

However, one should be cautious applying our results to a calculation of nuclear attenuation of charmonium. In exclusive photoproduction of charmonia\nthe uncertainty principle does not allow to resolve between J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 unless the formation\n2\ntime, tf = 2 E\u03c8 /(M\u03c82\u2032 \u2212 MJ/\u03c8\n) [3, 42], is shorter than the mean inter-nucleon separation in\n\nnuclei. Only one experiment [43] at \u223c 20 GeV satisfies this condition. Analyzed with an\nJ/\u03c8 N\n\noptical model it leads to \u03c3in\n\n= 3.5 \u00b1 0.8 mb in a good agreement with our calculations.\n26\n\n\fKST, BT\n\nGBW, BT\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\u03c3 [mb]\n\n10\n\n1\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\nwith spin rotation\nwithout spin rotation\nnon relativistic WF\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u221as [GeV]\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u221as [GeV]\n\n\u03c8N\nFigure 12: Comparison of the results for \u03c3tot\n(s) obtained with the exact expression (2) (solid curves) and with the approximations (45) (dashed) and (46)\n(dotted).\n\nThe nuclear photoproduction data [44] taken at 120 GeV cannot be treated in the same way\nsince the formation time, lf \u2248 10 f m exceeds the nuclear size. In addition, the coherence\n2\nlength, lc = 2 E\u03c8 /(MJ/\u03c8\n+ Q2 ) [3, 45], is also long, about 5 f m substantially increasing the\n\nattenuation path for the produced c\u0304c pair.\nIn the case of hadroproduction of charmonia off nuclei, the interplay of the formation\nand coherence time effects are as important as in photoproduction. On top of that, the\nsituation is complicated by decays of \u03c7s and \u03c8 \u2032 which substantially feed the yield of J/\u03c8.\nThese heavier states, even if their absorption cross sections are known from our calculations,\nare also subject to the effects of formation and coherence lengths.\nIn the analysis [46] of data from the experiment E866 of pA \u2192 J/\u03c8X collisions at 800 GeV,\nproper attention has been given to coherence and formation time effects with the result\n27\n\n\f(extrapolated to\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 10 GeV)\n\"J/\u03c8\u2032\u2032 p\n\n\u03c3ef f\n\n=\n\n5.0 \u00b1 0.4 mb ,\n\n(47)\n\n\u03c8p\n\u03c3tot\n= 10.5 \u00b1 3.6 mb ,\n\n(48)\n\n\u2032\n\nThe effective J/\u03c8-nucleon cross section which is fed by decays of heavier states can be\nestimated as follows,\n1\n\u03c3ef f\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c3ef f hT i =\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\nwi\n\u03c8i N\n\u03c3tot\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c8i N\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c3tot\n\nhT i\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere hT i \u2248 0.75 \u03c1A RA is the mean thickness of a nucleus with radius RA and the mean\ndensity \u03c1A \u2248 0.16 f m\u22123.\nEq. (49) is relevant for J/\u03c8 suppression in nuclear collisions (proton-nucleus and nucleusnucleus). In this reactions the observed J/\u03c8 arises from directly produced J/\u03c8's with probability w1 < 1 and from the other states \u03c7, \u03c8 \u2032 via decay after the charmonia have left the\ninteraction zone, where wi is the probability that the state \"i\" contributes to the finally\n\u03c8i p\nobserved J/\u03c8. Values for wi and \u03c3tot\nare given in Table 3 where m = 0, 1 is the projection\n\nof the orbital momentum of the c\u0304c pair on the direction of gluon-gluon collision in \u03c71,2 production (\u03c70 has a tiny branching to J/\u03c8). It turns out that \u03c71 and \u03c72 with m = 0 cannot be\nproduced or are strongly suppressed in gluon fusion due to the selection rules which forbid\nprojections \u00b11 for the total angular momentum (e.g. see [47]), this is why we put w2 = 0.\n\u221a\nWe calculate \u03c3ef f for tungsten used in the analysis [46] and find for s = 10 GeV\n\"J/\u03c8\u2032\u2032 p\n\n\u03c3ef f\n\n= 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 mb ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere the main uncertainty arises from the wi . This number is in a good accord with\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8p\nEq. (47), while the calculated value for \u03c3tot\nEq. (44) agrees well with (48).\n\nThe coherence effects are quite important even at the energy of the NA38/NA50 experiments (E\u03c8 \u2248 50 GeV ) at CERN, this is why the effective absorption cross section for \u03c8 \u2032\nproduction suggested by the data is about a half of the value we predict. At the energies\nof RHIC and LHC both the coherence and formation times substantially exceed the sizes of\nheavy nuclei, and shadowing becomes the dominant phenomenon.\n28\n\n\fTable 3: Values for the J/\u03c8-, \u03c8 \u2032 -, \u03c7- and effective \"J/\u03c8\"-proton cross sections at\n\u221a\nenergy s = 10 GeV.

The ingredients are (i) the factorized light-cone\n\nexpressions (1) - (2) for the cross sections; (ii) the perturbative light-cone wave functions for\nthe cc\u0304 component of the \u03b3 \u2217 ; (iii) light cone wave functions for the charmonia bound states,\nand (iv) a phenomenological dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) for a cc\u0304 interacting with a proton.\nThe dipole cross section rises with energy; the smaller is the transverse q\u0304q separation, the\nsteeper is the growth. The source of the energy dependence is the expanding cloud of gluons\nsurrounding the q\u0304q pair. The gluon bremsstrahlung is more intensive for small dipoles. The\ngluon cloud can be treated as a joint contribution of higher Fock states, |q\u0304 q nGi, however, it\ncan be also included into the energy dependence of \u03c3q\u0304q (rT , s), as we do, and this is the full\ndescription. Addition of any higher Fock state would be the double counting.\nAs function of energy the initial size of the q\u0304q source is gradually \"forgotten\" after multistep radiation, the small cross sections grow steeper and eventually approach the larger ones\nat very high energies. All the cross sections are expected to reach a universal asymptotic\nbehavior which saturates the Froissart bound.\n29\n\n\fThe effective dipole cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s) is parameterized in a form which satisfies the\nexpectations \u03c3qq\u0304 \u221d rT2 for rT \u2192 0 (color transparency), but levels off for rT \u2192 \u221e. Two\nparameterizations for \u03c3qq\u0304 (rT , s), whose form and parameters have been fitted to describe\n\u03c0p\n\u03c3tot\n(s) and the structure function F2 (x, Q2 ) are used in our calculations.\n\nWhile the description of the photon wave function is quite certain, the light-cone wave\nfunction of charmonia is rather ambiguous. We have followed the usual recipe in going\nfrom a nonrelativistic wave function calculated from a Schr\u00f6dinger equation to a light cone\nform. We have included the Melosh spin rotation which is often neglected and found that\nit is instrumental to obtain agreement, since no parameter is adjustable. In particular, it\nincreases the \u03c8 \u2032 photoproduction cross section by a factor 2 - 3 and rises the \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 ratio\nto the experimental value.\nAt the same time, the charmonium-nucleon total cross sections (J/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c7(m = 0) and\n\u03c7(m = 1)) turn out to be rather insensitive to the way how the light-cone wave function\nis formed, even applying no Lorentz transformation one arrives at nearly the same results.\nThis is why we believe that the predicted charmonium-nucleon cross section are very stable\nagainst the ambiguities in the light-cone wave function of charmonia. A significant energy\ndependence is predicted which varies from state to state in accord with our expectations.\nWe show our predictions for charmonium-nucleon cross sections in a restricted energy\n\u221a\nrange 10 GeV < s < 300 GeV , but this interval can be largely extended in both directions.\nSince the OZI rule suppresses the leading Reggeons, one can stay with gluonic exchanges\nrather far down to low energies, unless the charmed Reggeon exchanges become important\n[48].\nAcknowledgment: This work has been supported by a grant from the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr\nSchwerionenforschung Darmstadt (GSI), grant no.
