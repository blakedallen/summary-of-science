The relation between structure and\nfunction becomes a key area in the study of complex networks. In the study of networked-dynamics, the emergent synchronization of interacting oscillators generally\nhas occupied a privileged position because of its rich applications in variety of areas ranging from Neuroscience\nto Sociology [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nIn neural systems, the brain dynamics is characterized\nby synchronization phenomena for a given topology of\nsynapses. And in metabolic networks, hundreds of interconnected biochemical reactions are responsible for the\nbiomass and energy fluxes which are adjusted to optimize\nthe robustness of synchronized behavior. Other example\nis the synchronized or coordinated behavior of communication patterns in social organizations. The study of\nsynchronization provides us with insights into the key\nissue: how the collective dynamics couple the relationships between the systematic function and the underlying\ntopology.\nOne of the most successful attempts to understand synchronization phenomena is due to the Kuramoto model\n(KM) [18, 19], which is rich enough for many different\ncontexts, including superconducting currents in Josephson junction arrays, emerging coherence in populations\nof chemical oscillators, and the accuracy of central circadian pacemakers in insects and vertebrates, etc.. This\nmodel describes a population of N coupled phase oscillators which evolves in time according to the following\ndynamics\nX\nd\u03b8i\nAij sin(\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8i ) + \u03bei (t).\n= \u03c9i + \u03c3\ndt\nj\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03b8i represents the phase of the ith oscillator, \u03c9i the\nintrinsic frequency, \u03c3 the coupling constant, Aij the ef-\n\nfective coupling between the oscillators, and \u03bei (t) is the\nwhite noise due to the complicated environment, with\nexpectation and variance\nh\u03bei (t)i = 0,\nh\u03bei (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\nThere are many attractors that each oscillator rotates at\nits natural frequency when incoherent. As the coupling\nstrength increases, some units become resonant. At sufficiently strong coupling, when coherent, there is only one\nattractor of the dynamics, and all oscillators rotate at\nthe same frequency, \u03c9i , the average of \u03c9i . We call it\nfully synchronized.\nThe synchronization problem is solved mainly in the\nmean-field approach which, unfortunately, is not usually\nfulfilled in real systems. The nontrivial pattern of connectivity in complex networks brings the non mean-field\nproperties and incorporates many new questions to the\nresearch of synchronization. Because of the elegant work\nof Pecora and Carroll [20], the Master Stability Function\n(MSF) formalism allows us to analysis the dynamical synchronizability in terms of purely topological porperties,\nindependent of details of unit dynamics. However, the\nMSF requires several constraints and has limited applications that it only deals with the stability of the exact\nsynchronized states, i.e., it is used to study infinitesimal\ndeviations from the synchronization manifold of chaotic\noscillators. However, many realistic dynamics are only\nclose to or even far from the full synchronization.\nIn this work we study the KM dynamics departing\nfrom the fully synchronized state. We get the analytic\nexpression of the dynamical correlation between any two\noscillators which reveals the relation between the network dynamics and the underlying topology. It could\nbe used as a new algorithm to detect community structures. Moreover, we propose a new measure about the\nsynchronization in complex networks and scrutinize it in\n\n\f2\nin terms of the normal modes,\nd\u03b8\u03b1\n= \u2212\u03c3\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 + \u03b6\u03b1 (t),\n(3)\ndt\nP\nP\nwhere \u03b8\u03b1 = j \u03c8\u03b1j \u03b8j , \u03b6\u03b1 = j \u03c8\u03b1j \u03bej , and \u03c8\u03b1j denotes\nthe \u03b1th normalized eigenvector of the Laplacian, \u03bb\u03b1 is\nthe corresponding eigenvalue for \u03b1 = 0, ..., N \u2212 1. Considering \u03bei (t) is delta correlated, we can find easily that\n\u03b6\u03b1 (t) is also delta correlated: h\u03b6\u03b1 (t)\u03b6\u03b2 (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032 ).\nWithout loss of generalization, we set \u03c3 = 1, \u03b6\u03b1 (0) = 0.\nUsing stochastic calculus methods [21], we get\n\u03b8\u03b1 (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212\u03bb\u03b1 (t\u2212t ) \u03b6\u03b1 (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 ,\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nso that\nh\u03b8\u03b1 (t)2 i =\n15 30 45 60 75 90 105\n\n15 30 45 60 75 90 105\n\n15\n30\n45\n\n15\n30\n45\n\n60\n75\n90\n105\n\n60\n75\n90\n105\n\nZ tZ\n0\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ne\u2212\u03bb\u03b1 (t\u2212t ) e\u2212\u03bb\u03b1 (t\u2212t ) h\u03b6\u03b1 (t\u2032 )\u03b6\u03b1 (t\u2032\u2032 )idt\u2032 dt\u2032\u2032\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n2e\u22122\u03bb\u03b1 (t\u2212t ) dt\u2032\n\n0\n\n1\n=\n(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03bb\u03b1 t )\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nThus, the time scales of the dynamical relaxation of the\neigenmodes are inversely proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues. And for large t \u226b 1/2\u03bb\u03b1 , we have\nh\u03b8\u03b1 (t)2 i = 1/\u03bb\u03b1 .\n\nFIG. 1: Top row: Illustration of the Santa Fe Institute collaboration network.

Thus, we can rewrite the equation\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n(7)\n\nP\nwhere \u03b8 = N1 i \u03b8i and h...i stands for the average over\ninitial random phases. This analytic expression gives the\ndynamical correlation between any pair of oscillators just\nin terms of the properties of the underlying topology. Actually, the right term of Eq. 7 gives the pseudo-inverse of\nthe Laplacian matrix, which acts like a Green Function.\nIt could be used to detect the community structure in\nvarious complex networks.\nOne real world example with known community structure is the collaboration network of the Santa Fe Institute from ref. [22]. The top row of Fig. 1 illustrates\nthe largest component of the collaboration graph, which\nconsists of 118 scientists denoted by nodes. The edge\nis drawn between a pair of scientists if they coauthored\none or more papers. Obviously, the scientists of different\ninterests group in different communities.\n\n\f3\nwhich indicates that the time scales of the dynamical relaxation of the observed phases are inversely proportional\nto the degrees of the corresponding oscillators. The different connectivities in the topology give rise to the corresponding order of the eigenvalues, which are illustrated\nin Fig. 2. The hubs with the large eigenvalues induce the\nfast relaxations, i.e., the evolutional pattern of synchronization starts first at the hubs and then pervades almost\nthe whole network in a hierarchical structure across the\nnodes with smaller degrees. And for large t \u226b 1/2ki , we\nhave got h(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i )2 i = 1/ki , which indicates that hubs\nare synchronized more closely by the collective dynamics.\nFor a given realization of networks, we use R to denote\nthe average variance of phase variables which characterizes the collective synchronized ability of the underlying\nnetwork:\n\n120\n\n1/2k\n\nRank index i\n\n100\n\n1/2\n\n80\n\ni\n\ni\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0.02\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: (color online). Illustration of the same hierarchical structure in the eigenvalues spectra and degree series. It\nimplies a progressive cascade of the synchronization pattern\nfrom the central core to the nodes with smaller degrees. The\nnetwork data is used as the same as in Fig. 1.\n\nIn the bottom row of Fig. 1, we illustrate the dynamical correlation between any pairs of nodes on which the\nKM oscillators is placed. The left one is the analytic results from the relation Eq. 7 and the right is the results\nof numerical simulations from Eq. 1. They accord with\neach other very well. In the two figures we can identify\nthe distinct dynamics-based communities wherein nodes\nbecome strong correlated in groups, coherently with their\ntopological structure. Moreover, smaller subcommunities\ncan be found clearly in these dynamics-based communities which corresponds with the sketch map of the collaboration network. Although some nodes in the same\ndynamics-based community are not directly connected,\nthey are topologically equivalent and belong to the same\nstructural level. Therefore, they have strong correlation\non dynamics. The dynamics-based groups indicates the\ndifferent functional modules. When applied to the specific internal structure, which might be the fingerprint\nof different functional groups for social or biological networks, the dynamical correlation may help us understand\nbetter the interplay between systemic structure and function.\nIn another way, we can use the mean-field approximation to rewrite the Eq. 2 as:\nX\nd\u03b8i\n= \u2212\nAij (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) + \u03bei (t)\ndt\nj\n= \u2212ki (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03bei (t).\n\n(8)\n\nUsing the same stochastic calculus method, we get\nh(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8)2 i =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 e\u22122ki t ),\nki\n\n(9)\n\nN\n1 X\nR=\nh(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8)2 i,\nN i\n\n(10)\n\nThe smaller the value of R, the smaller the fluctuation\nof network is, i.e., the more synchronized . Substituting\nthe Eq. 7 and considering the orthonormality of \u03c8\u03b1i , we\nhave\nR=\n\nN \u22121\n1 X 1\n.\nN \u03b1=1 \u03bb\u03b1\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore, independent of details of unit dynamics, we\ncan characterize the dynamical synchronizability of networked systems just in terms of the spectra of the Laplacian matrix, i.e., the purely topological porperties. It is\nthe same as the spirit of the MSF. However, in contrast\nto the MSF, the new measure Eq. 11 considers the spectrum in its entirety, not only the extremal eigenvalues.\nWhat this new measure emphasizes is on the fluctuation\nof the process of synchronization, rather than on rigorous\nbounds for the threshold of desynchronization. In the following, we use this new quantity about synchronization,\nR to measure the synchronizable ability in small-world\n(SW) and scale-free (SF) networks, respectively.\nWe first consider the Watts-Strogatz model of the SW\nnetworks [23], which is constructed by a rewiring process\non a regular ring graph. The probability of rewiring connection is controlled by a parameter p, by tuning which\nthe obtained network possesses both short average distance and high heterogeneity that nodes no longer have\nthe same degrees, instead they follow a Poisson distribution. We define S as the standard deviation of the degree\ndistribution and D as the average network distance, averaged over all pairs of nodes. The upper layer of Fig. 3(a)\nshows the dependence of S and D on the rewiring probability p in the SW network. As p increases, the variance\nS increases, which implies that the degree distribution\nbecomes more broad and heterogeneous. And as expect,\nthe network distance D decreases as the rewiring probability p (or the heterogeneity of the degree distribution)\n\n\f4\n\n100\n\nthe underlying topology. Moreover, it also reveal the internal structure of networks that can be used as a new\nalgorithm to detect community structures. Further, we\nhave proposed a new measure about the synchronization\nin complex networks and scrutinize it in SW and SF networks. Our results indicate that the more heterogeneous\nand \"smaller\" the network is, the more closely it would\nbe synchronized by the collective dynamics. We hope our\nstudy can provide new insights into the understanding of\nthe role of synchronization between the network structure and function. We also expect it can provide new\ntools to detect community structure and to analyze the\nubiquitous synchronization phenomenon.\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\nD\n\nS\n5\n\n1\n\nD\n\nS\n\n0.1\n\n0.28\n\n1.6\n0.24\n\n1.2\n\nR\n\nR\n\n0.8\n\n0.20\n\n0.4\n0.0\n\n0.16\n0.0\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\np\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) The synchronizability of SW networks of size\nN = 1000, hki = 8. The average network distance D and\nthe new measure R decreases with the rewiring probability\np in the same trend, while the standard deviation S of the\ndegree distribution increases. (b) The synchronizability of SF\nnetworks of size N = 1000, k0 = 4. The values of D and R\nincrease with the scaling exponent \u03b3, while the values of S\nare decreased. Since less R means more synchronizable, all\nthe results in SW and SF networks indicate that the network\nwould be more synchronizable as it becomes \"smaller\" and\nmore heterogeneous. All plots are averaged over 100 realizations.\n\nincreases. In the lower layer of Fig. 3(a), R is observed\nto decrease, which implies enhancement of the synchronizable ability.\nSecondly, we implement the same measures on the SF\nnetwork. The model [24] is generated by randomly connecting nodes, forcing each nodes i to have connectivity ki \u2265 k0 which follows the probability distribution\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 . Note that decreasing \u03b3 increases S by inducing the longer tail in the connectivity distribution and\nsmaller \u03b3 gives rise to shorter D, as exhibited in the upper layer of Fig. 3(b). And in its lower layer, R is observed to increase as \u03b3 is increased, which indicates less\nsynchronized when less heterogeneous.\nThe results shown in Fig. 3 imply that the synchronizable ability on the SW and SF networks is improved as\nthe heterogeneity of the degree distribution is increased\nor as the average network distance is decreased. In other\nwords, as the network becomes more heterogeneous and\n\"smaller\", with S gets larger and D gets shorter, it would\nbecomes synchronized more closely by the collective dynamics.\nIn summary, we have investigated the synchronization\ndynamics of the KM departing from the fully synchronized state. We have got the analytic expression of the\ndynamical correlation between pairs of oscillators that\nreveals the relation between the network dynamics and\n\n[1] S.
