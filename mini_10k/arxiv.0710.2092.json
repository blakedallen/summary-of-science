In complex networks [3], scale invariance is traditionally restricted to\nthe scale-free property of the distributions of node degrees, which in a vast majority of complex networks follow power laws of the form P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2208 [2, 3]. In\nsearch for more complete self-similar descriptions, several recent works [4] introduced box-covering renormalization procedures, applied them to a few real networks,\nand found that certain networks, e.g., the Web and some\nbiological networks, have finite fractal dimensions and\ndegree distributions that remain invariant.\nDespite this promising progress, self-similarity and\nscale invariance of complex networks are still not well\ndefined in a proper geometric sense. The reason is that\nmany complex networks are not explicitly embedded in\nany physical space. As such, they lack any metric structure, except the one that their graph abstractions induce\nby the collection of lengths of shortest paths between\nnodes. However, this observable topological metric is\na poor source of length-based scaling factors. It does\nnot have large lengths as it exhibits the small-world [5]\nor even ultrasmall-world [6] property, meaning that the\ncharacteristic path lengths grow not polynomially but\n(sub)logarithmically with the network size. The apparent absence of any other metric structures supports the\ncommon belief that complex networks cannot be invariant under geometric length scale transformations.\nIn this paper, we undermine this belief by introducing\nthe concept of hidden metric spaces as natural reservoirs\nof distance scales with respect to which scale-free networks may be self-similar at all scales. At the formal\n\nlevel, hidden metric spaces are variations of hidden variables [7, 8, 9]. Specifically, we assume that all network\nnodes, in addition to forming an observed network topology, reside in an underlying hidden metric space, meaning\nthat for all pairs there are defined hidden distances satisfying the triangle inequality, which can be arbitrarily\nlarge. If hidden metric spaces do exist and play a role\nin shaping the observed network topologies, then strong\nclustering \u2013the high concentration of triangles\u2013 arises as\na natural consequence of the triangle inequality in the underlying geometry. Therefore, we focus on clustering as\na potential connection between the observed topologies\nand hidden geometries.\nConsider the following degree-thresholding renormalization procedure, which produces a hierarchy of subgraphs within a given graph G as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nFor each degree threshold kT = 0, 1, 2 . . ., first extract\nfrom G the subgraph G(kT ) induced by nodes with degrees k > kT . Second, for each node in G(kT ), compute\nits internal degree ki , i.e., the number of links that connect a given node to other nodes in G(kT ) and, finally,\nrescale ki 's by the average internal degree hki (kT )i in\nG(kT ) to obtain the rescaled quantity ki /hki (kT )i.\nWe applied this procedure to a few real complex networks and found that their main topological characteristics \u2013degree distributions, degree-degree correlations, and\nclustering\u2013 are self-similar with respect to the described\nprocedure: both before and after renormalization with\ndifferent values of threshold kT , all these characteristics\nclosely follow the same master curves describing the topological structure of the whole subgraph hierarchy. We\nnext randomized the observed topologies preserving the\ndegree distribution as in [10], and found that their degree distributions and degree-degree correlations are still\nself-similar, but clustering is not.\nWe provide examples of these empirical observations\nin Fig. 2, where we show the degree-dependent clustering\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the degree-thresholding renormalization.\n\ncoefficient of the renormalized graphs G(kT ) with different kT 's for the real and randomized topologies of the\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) map of the Internet\nat the Autonomous System level [11] and of the Pretty\nGood Privacy (PGP) social web of trust [12]. Both the\nBGP and the PGP are scale-free networks with exponents\n\u03b3BGP = 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 and \u03b3P GP = 2.5 \u00b1 0.2. For brevity, we\nomit plots showing self-similarity of degree distributions\nand degree-degree correlations. Fig. 2 shows that even\nthough the internal average degree hki (kT )i grows significantly for all networks, the average clustering coefficient\nof G(kT ) as a function of kT , c\u0304(kT ), is nearly constant\nfor the subgraphs of the real topologies, but it grows for\ntheir randomized counterparts. We also experimented\nwith airport networks [13] and found that they exhibit\nqualitatively the same results as the Internet (BGP) and\nthe social (PGP) networks. The BGP and PGP networks are more interesting and challenging for our purposes since, as opposed to airport networks, they appear\nto be not explicitly embedded in any observable physical\nspace [18].\nThe high levels of clustering observed in real networks\nand their self-similarity under the degree thresholding\nrenormalization find a plausible explanation in the assumption that some metric structures underlay the observed network topologies. Indeed, under this assumption, clustering becomes a natural consequence of the\ntriangle inequality in the metric space underneath. The\nfact that the randomized networks are not self-similar\n(cf. Fig. 2 b,d) also supports this observation. The applied degree-preserving randomization is a process that\ninvolves pairs of nodes, whereas the triangle inequality\nconcerns node triplets. Therefore, this randomization\nprocess cannot fully preserve the network properties imposed by the triangle inequality.\nIn the rest of the paper, we provide further evidence\nthat this metric space explanation is indeed plausible.\nWe do so by introducing a class of network models designed with the following three objectives: we want all\nnodes to exist in a metric space underlying the network\ntopology; we want to control the degree distribution and\nclustering, so that we can generate scale-free graphs with\nstrong clustering; and we want these graphs be smallworld. We then find that the networks generated by\nour model reproduce all the self-similar effects that we\nhave empirically observed in real networks. We empha-\n\nsize that although there are models of scale-free networks\nembedded in Euclidean lattices [14], none can simultaneously reproduce all the effects discussed above.\nTo define our model, we use the hidden variables formalism [7] taking as hidden variables nodes' coordinates\nin a metric space. Each two nodes are located at a certain\nhidden metric distance d, and connected with a probability r, which relates the network topology to the underlying metric space. This probability depends on the metric\ndistance d as r(d/dc ), where dc is the characteristic distance scale, i.e., a parameter that calibrates whether a\ngiven distance is short or long. Function r must be a\npositive integrable function of d \u2208 [0, \u221e). Consequently,\nnodes that are close to each other in the metric space are\nmore likely to be connected in the graph.\nTo engineer full control over the degree distribution,\nwe link the characteristic distance scale dc to the topology of the network. We assume that dc is not a constant\nbut depends on some topological properties of the nodes.\nSpecifically, we assign an additional hidden random variable \u03ba to each node, which corresponds to its expected\ndegree. For simplicity, let our hidden metric space be a\nhomogeneous and isotropic D-dimensional space. Then\nthe choice [15]\ndc (\u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 ) \u221d (\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 )1/D\n\n(1)\n\nguarantees that the average degree of nodes with variable\n\u03ba is k\u0304(\u03ba) = \u03ba. Therefore, the distribution \u03c1(\u03ba) of this\nvariable is asymptotically equal to the degree distribution\nP (k) in the resulting networks [7].\nEq. (1) has another important consequence: high degree nodes \u2013hubs\u2013 are likely to be connected regardless\ntheir distance in the metric space because dc (hub,hub)\nis large. Low degree nodes, on the other hand, are connected only if they are close, whereas hubs are connected\nto low degree nodes if their distances are at most intermediate. This pattern is typical of real networks embedded\nin metric spaces, such as the airport network. It is very\nlikely that two major hubs like New York and London are\nconnected, but it is very unlikely that two small airports\nare connected, unless they are close enough.\nWe can now generate graphs with any degree distribution by choosing an appropriate \u03c1(\u03ba). In particular, to\n\u03ba\u2212\u03b3 ,\ngenerate scale-free graphs we set \u03c1(\u03ba) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03ba\u03b3\u22121\n0\n\u03ba > \u03ba0 \u2261 (\u03b3 \u2212 2)hki/(\u03b3 \u2212 1), \u03b3 > 2, which after transformations described in [7] yields the degree distribution\nP (k) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03ba\u03b3\u22121\n0\n\n\u0393(k + 1 \u2212 \u03b3, \u03ba0 )\n,\nk!\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the incomplete gamma function. The asymptotic behavior of this degree distribution for large k is\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , i.e., the same as of \u03c1(\u03ba). This result is independent of the dimension of the hidden metric space\nand it is valid for any integrable connection probability\nof the form r(d/dc ), where dc \u2261 dc (\u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 ) is any function\nthat factorizes in terms of \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 .\n\n\f3\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\na\n\n0\n\n10\n\nb\n\n0\n\n10\n\na\n\n0\n\nb\n\nInternet BGP map\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nkT=5\nkT=10\nkT=20\nkT=50 PGP network\nkT=100\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nki /<ki(kT)>\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\nBGP\nBGP randomized\nPGP\nPGP randomized\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nki /<ki(kT)>\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nkT\n\n10\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nd\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nki /<ki(kT)>\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nc\n\nModel randomized\nModel\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\nki /<ki(kT)>\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nki /<ki(kT)>\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nd\n\nModel randomized\nModel\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nModel randomized\n1\n\nPGP network\nrandomized\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nkT\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\nkT\n\nf\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: a-b: Scaling of the degree-dependent clustering coefficient in a modeled network using the connection probability\ngiven by Eq.

We specify the connection probability r such\nthat we can control clustering in the generated graphs.\nSpecifically, we define r, compliant with Eq. (1), as\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\nd(\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 )\n, \u03b1 > 1,\n(3)\nr(\u03b8, \u03ba; \u03b8\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032 ) = 1 +\n\u03bc\u03ba\u03ba\u2032\nwhere d(\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) is the geodesic distance over the circle, i.e.,\nthe metric distance d between nodes discussed above,\nby the normalization condiand \u03bc = (\u03b1\u22121)\n2hki is given\nR\n2\ntion hki = N/(2\u03c0) \u03c1(\u03ba)r(\u03b8, \u03ba; \u03b8\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032 )\u03c1(\u03ba\u2032 )d\u03b8d\u03bad\u03b8\u2032 d\u03ba\u2032\nfor large N . Parameter \u03b1 controls clustering. The larger\n\u03b1, the more preferred short-distance connections; thus,\nthe more triangles are formed. The exact dependence of\nthe average clustering c\u0304 on \u03b1 is not important, but both\nour analytic and simulation results confirm that, as expected, c\u0304 \u2192 0 when \u03b1 \u2192 1, and that c\u0304 converges to a\n\nconstant value, dependent on \u03b3, when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. We skip\nthe details for brevity; they will be published elsewhere.\nWe next check whether our synthetic graphs are small\nworlds, as spatially embedded networks do not always\nhave this property [14, 16]. To this end, we compute the\nprobability p(d, \u03ba|\u03ba\u2032 ) that a node with hidden variable \u03ba\u2032\nhas a neighbor with hidden variable \u03ba at geodesic distance d on S1 . We use the hidden variables formalism [7]\nand the result reads\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\n2\nd\n\u2032\np(d, \u03ba|\u03ba ) = \u2032 \u03c1(\u03ba) 1 +\n.\n(4)\n\u03ba\n\u03bc\u03ba\u03ba\u2032\nIntegration over \u03ba gives the probability that a node has\na neighbor at distance d. For large d, this function scales\nas p(d|\u03ba\u2032 ) \u223c d\u2212\u03b1 when \u03b1 < \u03b3 \u2212 1 and p(d|\u03ba\u2032 ) \u223c d1\u2212\u03b3\nwhen \u03b1 > \u03b3 \u2212 1. The network is a small world when\n \u0304 \u2032) =\nthe\nhidden distance to nearest neighbors d(\u03ba\nR average\n\u2032\nxp(x|\u03ba )dx diverges in the large-N and, consequently,\nlarge-R limit. Such divergence indicates the presence of\nlinks connecting nodes located at all, including arbitrarily\n \u0304 \u2032)\nlarge, hidden distance scales. This average distance d(\u03ba\ndiverges when the exponent of the asymptotic form of\np(d|\u03ba\u2032 ) for large d is smaller than 2, i.e., when either\n1 < \u03b1 < 2 or 2 < \u03b3 < 3, or both. Real scale-free networks\nhave values of \u03b3 between 2 and 3, meaning that they\ncorrespond to the class of small-world networks in our\nmodel, regardless of the value of \u03b1.\nFinally, we analyze the self-similarity of networks produced by our model. Thanks to the proportionality between k\u0304(\u03ba) and \u03ba, we can work in the \u03ba-space instead of\nthe k-space. Since \u03c1(\u03ba) is a power law, the distribution\nof \u03ba for nodes in the subgraph G(\u03baT ) (with \u03ba > \u03baT ),\n\u03c1(\u03ba|\u03baT ), is given by the same power-law function but\n\n\f4\nstarting at \u03baT instead of \u03ba0 . Therefore, the average of \u03ba\nwithin G(\u03baT ) is given by h\u03ba(\u03baT )i = hki\u03baT . The number\nof nodes in G(\u03baT ) is N \u03ba1\u2212\u03b3\n, so that their density in S1\nT\n1\u2212\u03b3\nis \u03b4(\u03baT ) = \u03b4\u03baT , where \u03b4 is the density of the original\ngraph G. Since the connection probability does not depend on \u03baT , subgraphs G(\u03baT ) are replicas of G after the\nfollowing renormalization of the parameters:\n\u03ba0 \u2212\u2192 \u03baT\n\n;\n\n\u03b4 \u2212\u2192 \u03b4\u03ba1\u2212\u03b3\n.\nT\n\n(5)\n\nIn particular, the average degree of nodes with hidden\nvariable \u03ba in G(\u03baT ), k\u0304i (\u03ba|\u03baT ), and the average degree of\nall nodes in G(\u03baT ), hki (\u03baT )i, are\nk\u0304i (\u03ba|\u03baT ) = \u03ba2\u2212\u03b3\n\u03ba and hki (\u03baT )i = \u03ba3\u2212\u03b3\nhki.\nT\nT\n\n(6)\n\nThe degree distribution in G(\u03baT ) is given by the same\nanalytic expression Eq. (2), except that hki (\u03baT )i from\nEq. (6) replaces hki in Eq. (2).\nThe exact expression for clustering in G(\u03baT ) is rather\nlong and we omit it here for brevity, but it can be easily\nderived from results in [7]. What matters for our analysis is that the clustering coefficient of nodes with hidden\nvariable \u03ba in G(\u03baT ) satisfies c\u0304(\u03ba|\u03baT ) = f (\u03ba/\u03baT ), where\nf is some function. It follows that\nR the average clustering coefficient in G(\u03baT ), c\u0304(\u03baT ) = \u03baT d\u03ba\u03c1(\u03ba|\u03baT )c\u0304(\u03ba|\u03baT ),\ntakes a finite value independent of \u03baT . Using once again\nthe proportionality between the \u03ba-space and k-space and\nthe scaling relations in Eq. (6), we conclude that\nc\u0304(ki |kT ) \u2248 f (ki /kT3\u2212\u03b3 ) = f \u0303(ki /hki (kT )i),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we use the symbol \"\u2248\" to account for fluctuations\nof degrees of nodes with small values of \u03ba.\nIn Fig. 3, we show that our simulation results match\nperfectly the scaling of clustering predicted by Eq. (7).\nThe same figure demonstrates that the clustering-related\nself-similarity properties of our modeled networks and\ntheir randomizations are qualitatively the same as of real\nnetworks in Fig. 2. We emphasize that the self-similarity\nof clustering observed in our model does not depend either on the dimension of the hidden space or on the final\nform of r. The only requirements are that nodes are\nlocated in a metric space and connected under the integrable connection probability r(d/dc ) with dc given by\nEq. (1), and that the degree distribution is scale-free.\nIn summary, hidden geometries underlying the observed topologies of some complex networks appear\nto provide a simple and natural explanation of their\ndegree-renormalization self-similarity. If we take the\nmost generic interpretation of hidden distances as measures of either structural or functional similarity between\nnodes [17? ], and admit that more similar nodes are more\nlikely to be connected, then the hidden and observable\nforms of transitivity become clearly related. At the hidden geometry layer, this transitivity is the transitivity\nof \"being close,\" while at the observed topology layer, it\n\nis the transitivity of \"being connected.\" In future work,\nhidden metric spaces may find far-reaching applications\nsuch as the design of efficient routing and searching algorithms for communication and social networks. Also\nworth pursuing is studying the relationship between fractality in [4] and self-similarity under our renormalization\nprocedure.\nWe thank Romualdo Pastor-Satorras and kc claffy for\nuseful suggestions.
