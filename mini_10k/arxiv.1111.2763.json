In other words, consistent enrollment is\nmandatory in order to preserve system consistency.

It is also shown here that the fuzzy 3-valent\nmodel of iris recognition is hosted by an 8-valent Boolean\nalgebra of modulo 8 integers that represents the computational\nformalization in which a biometric system (a software agent) can\nachieve the artificial understanding of iris recognition in a\nlogically consistent manner.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nBecause the visual acuity of the human agent is doubled by its\nintelligence \u2013 both of them together ensuring an excellent\nquality in indentifying the (dis)similarity of iris images, the\ngeometry that illustrates the binary decisions given by the\nhuman agent during a Turing test [11] of iris recognition is\nvery simple (Fig. 1.a): it consists of one collection of crisp\npoints (0 and 1) and one histogram that counts how many\ntimes a decision of unitary score (1 - for the case of similar\nirides) or a null decision (0 - for the pairs of non-similar\nirides) was given by the human agent. Still, the geometry that\nillustrates the fuzzy binary decisions given by a software\nagent ([6]-[8]) during a Turing test of iris recognition is not\nthat simple: in this case, the fuzzy biometric decisions given\nby the software agent define (draw) a f-geometry [13] in\nwhich the intra- and inter-class score distributions could be a\nlittle bit confused (Fig. 1.c, Fig. 2.a, Fig. 2.b), or confused\nmuch stronger (Fig. 1.b, Fig. 1.c in [6], Fig. 10 in [4]), or not\nconfused at all. (Fig. 1.b from here, and Fig. 4.a, Fig. 4.b,\nFig. 4.c in [6]).\nA. Crisp / Fuzzy Iris Recognition\nIn fact, Fig. 1.a illustrates that iris recognition is crisp for a\nhuman agent, and consequently, the recognition function R\n(as it is perceived by the human agent) is a crisp indicator of\nthe imposter (0) and genuine (1) classes of iris pairs (P):\nR(\u2022,\u2022): P \u2192{0,1},\nIn concordance with the terminology introduced in [13], the\nfunction R (Fig. 1.a) will be referred to as the prototype\nrecognition function and it is a crisp concept. The goal of\ndesigning automated iris recognition systems is to find fuzzy\napproximations f-R for the prototype recognition function R,\n\nas close as possible to R. Such an approximation f-R will be\nfurther referred to as a fuzzy recognition function. The fuzzy\napproximations f-R obtained by applying automated iris\nrecognition methods are of the same types as those presented\nin Fig. 1.b (an excellent approximation, [7]), Fig. 1.c, Fig. 2.a,\nFig. 2.b (very good approximations, [8]), Fig. 10 in [4] (good\napproximation), Fig. 1.b - Fig. 1.c and Fig. 4.a - Fig. 4.c in [6]\n(good approximations), where the marks (good, very good,\nexcellent) were given using as a reference the result obtained\nin an approach considered nowadays as being the \"state of the\nart\" in iris recognition (and marked here as \"good\napproximation\" [4]).\nB. Why Crisp, Why Fuzzy?\nIn the case in which the recognition is made using artificial\nagents and good quality eye images, the fact that the\napproximations f-R depart from the prototype R (situation\nillustrated in Fig. 1.b - Fig. 1.b.c and Fig. 4.a - Fig. 4.c from\n[6] and in Fig. 10 from [4]) can not be caused by the lack of\nvisual acuity of the system, but only by the less intelligent\nmanner in which the system decides (understands) iris\nsimilarity or dissimilarity. Practically, the artificial agent\nfuzzifies the prototype R and the separation between genuine\nand imposter score distributions. More inadequate and\nunintelligent the image processing is, much confusion it\nintroduces in the biometric decision model. There are two\nsignificant differences between the ways in which the human\nagent and software agent decide the similarity or dissimilarity\nof two iris images:\n- Ordinary people are not aware of the numerical reality of an\nimage but only of certain meanings \u201edecoded\u201f accordingly to\ntheir experience from the chromatic variation captured in the\nimage. For the human agent the iris image is not a numerical\ndata but a set of complex knowledge about the iris texture and\nthe image quality (given by the technical acquisition\nconditions and the posture in which the eye is captured). The\nsimilarity/dissimilarity decision given by the human agent for\na pair of iris images is based on ad-hoc techniques of\ncomparing two such sets of knowledge, techniques which are\nadaptive in relation with the pair of images analyzed.\n- An artificial agent makes the biometric decision using only\nnumerical support. From its point of view, the iris image is\nnumerical data in the first place. Depending on the\nintelligence with which it is endowed, the artificial agent can\nextract (artificial) knowledge about the numerical data, which\n\n\fis usually referred to as \u201efeatures\u201f, and further encoded in a\nnumeric format. For example, the binary iris code ([1] - [4],\n[6]) is a binary encoding of the features extracted from a uint8\n(8-bit unsigned integer) iris image. The artificial agent\nperforms the comparison of two iris images indirectly, by\ncomparing encoded features of the two iris images.\nIn short, the human agent operates in a rich knowledge space,\nwhereas an artificial agent usually encodes the actual\nknowledge space in a relatively poor, partial and often\nimprecise numeric data, in a manner very similar to lossy\ncompression. This is why the fuzzification is almost inherent\nin the ordinary practice of automated iris recognition.\nC. The problem\nAs it was described above, any simple Turing test of iris\nrecognition undertaken by using good quality images [9]\nconfirms that different or identical iris images are easily and\ncorrectly recognized by human agents and fuzzy recognized\nby software agents. The cause of this happening is that the\nsame problem is represented (projected) in different spaces of\nknowledge, or in other words, as it is intuitively illustrated in\nFig. 2, humans and software agents see the iris recognition\nfrom different perspectives. For the human agent \u201egenuine\u201f\nand \u201eimposter\u201f are crisp and disjoint concepts, whereas for the\nartificial agent they are fuzzy concepts which sometimes\nshare a confusion zone. The problem is how to reconcile these\ntwo different views that humans and artificial agents have on\niris recognition. The solution is to find a suitable defuzzification of the imposter and genuine score distributions which\nguarantees that the fuzzy (and consequently the crisp)\nconcepts \u201egenuine\u201f and \u201eimposter\u201f are disjoint, the\nappartenence of a pair of irides to these fuzzy or crisp sets\nbeing, in this case, mutually exclusive events.\nD. Related Works\nThe papers investigating logical aspects of iris recognition or\nlogical aspects of biometry in general are indeed very few.\nThe situation when a pair of irides ambiguously belongs to\nboth imposter and genuine fuzzy sets is investigated in [8]. It\nis shown there that in such case, artificial understanding of\niris recognition experimental data is logically inconsistent. It\nis the case of wolf-lamb pair discussed in [12].\nIt is not the first time when we say it, what iris recognition\nreally is and how different providers of biometric solutions\ncompete to each other are two very different things. Still, due\nto this competition a lot of commented experimental data was\npublished ([5], for example), all of them together\ninvoluntarily proving that Equal Error Rate (EER) is a crisp\nconcept only in theory. The negative aspect of this\ncompetition is the fact that a lot of resources were invested to\nminimize EER value without a preliminary proper\ninvestigation of the suitable means of doing that, but as\nillustrated in Fig. 1.a and Fig. 1.d, the real improvement of iris\nrecognition technology depends on finding and accepting a\nmajor change of perspective which implicitly leads to EER\nminimization. The first steps in this direction were undertaken\nwith very good results in [8] and [7] (see Fig. 2.a, Fig. 2.b) by\ndefining and simulating Intelligent Iris Verifier (IIV)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 1.

However, the artificial\n(automated) understanding of the experimental data obtained\nin these simulations proved to be quite a difficult but\nrewarding task. The last section of this paper shows that\nclarifying the logical model of iris recognition allowed us to\ndefine iris recognition theory and the problem of designing\nimproved iris recognition systems as classical problems of\nsystem identification [10]. In this perspective, designing iris\nrecognition systems means identifying possible variables\n([10], type I.a structure identification problem), relevant\nvariables ([10], type I.b structure identification problem),\ninput-output relation as a collection of fuzzy if-then Sugeno\nrules ([10], type II.a structure identification problem), the\npartitioning of the premise space ([10], type II.b structure\nidentification problem), and doing all of these accordingly to\nthe results of a Turing test (Fig. 1.a) and in a logically\nconsistent manner.\nThe experimental data used in this paper is obtained in [8]\nand illustrated in Fig. 2.a and Fig. 2.b. The reason for using\nthese data is that the imposter and genuine score distributions\nobtained in this case are much closer to the original\nrecognition prototype function R (Fig. 1.a) than those\nobtained in other approaches.\n\n(b)\n\nII. A FUZZY 3-VALENT DISAMBIGUATED MODEL OF IRIS RECOGNITION\n\nWhen \u201egenuine\u201f and \u201eimposter\u201f (pairs / comparisons) are\nfuzzy concepts / sets that share a (narrower or a wider)\nconfusion zone, there are elements of vocabulary (irides / iris\ncodes / digital identities) which ambiguously belong in both\nof them. Such a 2-valent fuzzy model of iris recognition is\nambiguous and logically inconsistent [8]. Disambiguation is\nachieved by introducing a third fuzzy set, namely the fuzzy\nEER interval (f-EER) as a separator between the \u201egenuine\u201f\nand \u201eimposter\u201f fuzzy sets which in this way become disjoint,\nthe appartenence of a recognition score to them being, in this\ncase, mutually exclusive events.\nA. A Practical Example\nDisambiguation is a matter of system calibration and design\n(a type II.b structure identification problem, [10]) which must\nbe carried out with respect to the desired FAR / FRR (False\nAccept / Reject Rate) specification. For instance, let us\nconsider the requirement that a system must have very low\nFAR and FRR rates, 1E-10 to be more precise. Let us\nconsider that we know a way to pessimistically estimate the\nFAR and FRR for scores where experimental data is not\ndense enough, or is completely missing, as POFA and POFR\n(Pessimistic Odds of False Accept / Reject). Hence, the\nrecognition of identical / different irides will take place for all\nsimilarity scores t for which POFA(t)<1E-10, respectively for\nwhich POFR(t)<1E-10. Hence, the fuzzy EER interval\n(f-EER) is determined as (n,p), n=POFA-1(1E-10),\np=POFR-1(1E-10)) which for the case considered is well\napproximated by the interval (0.3725, 0.55). Because FAR\nand POFA are both decreasing functions, and because FRR\nand POFR are both increasing functions (with respect to the\n\n(a)\nFig. 3.

The candidates to choose from are illustrated\nin Table 5, where the empty fuzzy value (E) encodes (the\nempty set as the set of) the impossible states/decisions of a\nlogically consistent biometric system: the states/decisions in\nwhich the system accepts both the positive and the negative\nclaim regarding an iris code candidate and an identity is not\nobservable in a logically consistent biometric system.\nAn algebra isomorphic to I3 is S3=((E, I, O, D), U, \u2229, C) the Boolean algebra of strings (unsorted and with no\nrepetition) generated through concatenation, intersection and\ncomplementary by the empty string E=\u201f \u201f and the distinct\ncharacters \u201eI\u201f, \u201eO\u201f, \u201eD\u201f, corresponding to the modal values I,\nO and D.\nThe following function:\n\n[0.55, 1]\n\nMODEL OF IRIS RECOGNITION\n\nDISCOMFORT\n\nIII. 8-VALENT ISOMORPHIC BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS WHICH CAN HOST A FUZZY 3-\n\n-\n\nTABLE 2: BIOMETRIC DECISION IN A FUZZY 3-VALENT DISAMBIGUATED\n\n[0, 0.3725]\n\npair are, in fact, unenrollable, or else, the restriction of the\nsystem to the set of these pairs is logically inconsistent.

The explicit formula of the\nsum operation calculus has been further defined through\ncomplementarity:\n\nand verified against data within Table 6 and Fig. 4.d.\nAt this stage the following question appears: in what\nformal language are well-formed the strings that define the\nproduct and the sum within the Boolean algebra (Z8, P, S, N)?\nThey are well-defined in a formal language obtained by\noverloading Peano Arithmetic with the first degree logic of\nthe propositions about the natural order between modulo 8integers (\u201ea b\u201f, \u201ea \u2264 b\u201f). In this language, the expression\n(aM2n+1 2n) which interferes in the calculation of P and S\nreturns the natural value 0 or 1 accordingly with the true\nvalue associated to the inequality. Hence, it has been\nillustrated that, in order to describe the 8-valent fuzzy logic of\niris recognition, Peano Arithmetic must be extended with\nlogical support. Of course, we could see this in a reversed\nperspective: since it is normal that the arithmetic to describe\nthe Boolean algebras generated by finite subsets of natural\nnumbers, it is also normal to consider that the study of a fuzzy\nlogic model of iris recognition has lead us to an improved\nmodel of arithmetic. However, this paper is not concerned\nwith establishing these pure theoretical aspects. If the\narithmetic should or shouldn\u201ft be overloaded with logical\nsupport, it is a question for theoreticians. Here in this paper\nthe overloaded model of arithmetic is called Peano-2\nArithmetic and it is used to compute the operations within\n8-valent Boolean algebra of iris recognition (Z8, P, S, N).\n\nFig. 4.

BACK TO THE IRIS RECOGNITION PRACTICE\n\nFirst of all, the artificial understanding of the experimental\ndata obtained in iris recognition tests illustrated in Fig. 3 is\nexpressed in the following theorem (N. Popescu-Bodorin,\nV.E. Balas, [8]):\n\n\fV. CONCLUSION\n\nTheorem 1: The correspondence\n:\n\nE\n0\n\nD\n1\n\nO\n2\n\nI\n4\n\nOD\n3\n\nID\n5\n\nIO\n6\n\nIOD\n7\n\nachieves the defuzzification of the fuzzy sets I, D and O as\nthe elements 4, 1 and 2 from the 8-valent Boolean algebra\n(Z8, P, S, N), where:\n\nand \u201eM\u201f stands for modulo.\nSecondly, the artificial understanding of the experimental data\nobtained in iris recognition tests illustrated in Fig. 3 is\nlogically consistent and reflected in the following theorem:\nTheorem 2: System structure and consistency of the fuzzy\n3-valent disambiguated model of iris recognition (N.\nPopescu-Bodorin):\nLet ICP a set of iris code pairs fuzzy assigned to the fuzzy\nsets D, O and I by a recognition function f-R as in Fig. 3.b and\nTable 4. Let EICP be the set of enrollable iris code pairs,\nEICP = f-R-1(I) U f-R-1(D), i.e. the support of the fuzzy\nconcepts I and D as they appear through the fuzzy recognition\nfunction f-R, and let f-K = (EICP, f-R, {I, D}) the fuzzy\nformal theory of iris recognition defined over the vocabulary\nof enrollable iris code pairs (a restriction of the fuzzy 3-valent\ndisambiguated model to the vocabulary of enrollable pairs).\nThen the fuzzy theory f-K is f-consistent as a theory of\nrecognition (i.e. its defuzzified form is a consistent theory of\nrecognition).\nProof:\nLet us consider the following partitioning of the input space:\nInput\n(octal)\n\nState\nOutput\nOutput\n(octal)\n(octal)\n(binary)\nD\u22611\n1\n0\nEICP \u2261 5\nI\u22614\n4\n1\nICP \u2261 7\nf-K theory\nIOD \u2261 7\nK theory\nUICP \u2261 2\nO\u22612\nFuzzy 3-valent disambiguated model of iris recognition\n\nMaintaining consistency of a biometric system is a matter\nof partitioning the input space into two classes: enrollable and\nunenrollable pairs. Consistent enrollment is mandatory in\norder to preserve system consistency.\nThe fact that the fuzzy 3-valent disambiguated model of\niris recognition is incomplete (there are, indeed, undecidable\npairs in the input space) is reflected in the user discomfort\n(undecidable pairs must be discarded and the user must repeat\nthe authentication attempt) but also in the system safety.\nAs a theory of recognition, f-K is f-consistent and\ncomplete: for any pair of its vocabulary there is only one\nbiometric decision to be given, specifically the correct one.\nConsistency in iris recognition is not achievable just by\nsetting a threshold and doing one-to-one comparisons. It can\nbe guaranteed only by establishing a safety band (f-EER\ninterval) and practicing one-to-all comparisons for each\nauthentication / identification / enrollment attempt.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Donald Monro (Dept. of\nElectronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath, UK) for\ngranting the access to the Bath University Iris Image Database.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\nPartitioning\n(octal)\n\nP(4,1) = 0, and S(4,1) = 5, or equivalently, the fuzzy sets 4 and\n1 are mutually exclusive and complementary to each other in\nthe output space, which in its turn generates a subalgebra\n({0,4,1,5}, P, S, N) of (Z8, P, S, N). Consequently, the fuzzy\ntheory f-K = (EICP, f-R, {I, D}) illustrated in Fig. 3.b can by\ndefuzzified as a crisp theory K = (EICP, R, {1, 0}) like that\nillustrated in Fig. 1.a. In other words, in the vocabulary of f-K\ntheory there is no support for the concept of wolf-lamb [12]\npair (there is no support for impersonation).\u25a1\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nJ.G.
