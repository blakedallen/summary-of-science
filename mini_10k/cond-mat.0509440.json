It also plays a central role\nin the current topic of quantum information processing,\nwhere quantum bits (qubits) need to be addressed\ncoherently. While excitons confined to semiconductor\nquantum dots (SQDs) are attractive qubits [1-4], they\nalso provide a fundamental testing ground for coherent\nlight-matter interactions in the solid-state. In the linear\nexcitation regime, the confined exciton's wavefunction\ncan, for instance, be manipulated by tailored pulse-pairs\nvia quantum interference [5]. Under strong field\nexcitation, on the other hand, the upper state of a\ntwo-level exciton becomes significantly populated and,\nwith pulse-pair excitation, its dynamics involve the\nsubtle interplay between Rabi oscillations and quantum\ninterference [6,7]. Recently, such capabilities have led to\nthe SQD implementation of the one-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa\nalgorithm [8] as well as the operation of a full two-qubit\nC-ROT gate [9].\nHere we are concerned with non-linear coherent\noptical control of the fine-structure-split states, |x\u3009 and |y\u3009,\nof an excited exciton in a single SQD. These states\noriginate in SQD shape anisotropy [10,11] and play an\nimportant role in spin relaxation [12], biexciton creation\n[9,13], quantum beats and Raman beats [14]. Together\nwith the vacuum state, |v\u3009 (no exciton), they naturally\ndefine a V-type three-level system, composed of two\northogonal transition dipole moments. In atomic V-type\nsystems, important quantum effects have been pointed\nout [15,16]. Yet there appear to be few investigations in\nthe solid-state counterpart.\nIn this letter, we report on photoluminescence (PL)\nstudies of a single self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs SQDs\nwith V-type exciton energy structure. The \u041fx and \u041fy\n\ntransitions to |x\u3009 and |y\u3009 are excited simultaneously by\nstrong polarization-tailored pulses, resulting in unique\ndynamics involving the coupled transitions, Rabi\noscillations, and quantum interference. In particular, we\nshow that population oscillations between the two\northogonal states are realized, although a direct\ntransition among them is forbidden. These interpretations\nare confirmed by density matrix calculations of the\ntime-evolution of the system.\n\n(a)\n\n|x \u3009\n\n\u2206\n\u03b3 xy\nh\u03c9\n\n|y \u3009\n\u03a9x\n\n\u03b3x\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b5y(t)\n\ny\n\nr\n\n\u03b5 (t )\n\n|g \u3009\n\u03a9y\n\n\u03b3y\n\nLaser\ndetuning:\n\nh\u03c9x\nh\u03c9 y\n\n\u03b4 x = h(\u03c9 x \u2212 \u03c9 )\n\u03b4 y = h(\u03c9 y \u2212 \u03c9 )\n\nh\u03c9g\nPL(y)\n\nPL(x)\n\n|v\u3009\n\n\u03b1\n0\n\n\u03b5x(t)\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1.

For\nexperimental comparison we thus have to resort to\nnumerical integration of Eq. (1) using the two-pulse\nmatrix M(t) in which the first pulse acts as an\ninitialization pulse for the case \u03c1 xx (0) , \u03c1 yy (0) \u2260 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThe solutions of Eq.(1), in terms of the populations of |x\u3009\nand |y\u3009 then read:\n\uf8f1\uf8f4 \u03c1 yy = sin 2 \u03b1 eff sin 2 ( 1 \u03b8 eff ), \u03c1 xx (0) = \u03c1 yy (0) = 0;\n2\n(6)\n\uf8f2\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 \u03c1 xx = cos \u03b1 eff sin ( 12 \u03b8 eff ), \u03c1 xx (0) = \u03c1 yy (0) = 0;\n\nDephasing prevents initialization into a stationary state,\nand instead brings the system into a superposition state\nwhich is allowed to freely evolve in the non-rotating\nframe. Therefore, the relative phase between the two\npulses plays an important role and is reflected in the data\nby fine-time PL oscillations.\nThe polarized PL signals are shown in Fig. 3 as a\nfunction of input pulse area without any pre-pulse [Fig.\n3(a)(b)(c)], and with a y-polarized \u03c0-pre-pulse [Fig.\n3(d)(e)(f)]. In both cases, the polarization of the\nmanipulation pulse was fixed at \u03b1 = \u03c0 / 4 while its\n\n\uf8f1\uf8f4 \u03c1 yy = sin 2 (2\u03b1 eff ) sin 4 ( 1 \u03b8 eff ),\n\u03c1 xx (0) = 1;\n4\n(7)\n\uf8f2\n2\n2 1\n2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 \u03c1 xx = [1 \u2212 2 cos \u03b1 eff sin ( 4 \u03b8 eff )] , \u03c1 xx (0) = 1;\nFurthermore, if \u03b1 eff = \u03c0 / 4 , the population difference\n\nbetween the two sub-states has the general form,\n\u03c1 yy \u2212 \u03c1 xx = ( \u03c1 yy (t 0 ) \u2212 \u03c1 xx (t 0 )) cos( 12 \u03b8 eff )\n\n(8)\n\nEquations (6), (7), and (8) reveal three interesting\n\n3\n\n\fpulse area was varied by changing the laser intensity.\nIn the absence of a pre-pulse, both PL(x) and PL(y)\noscillate with the same period as expected for \u03c1 xx and\n\nThe latter behavior validates the assumption that\nspin-relaxation is negligible during the carrier relaxation\nfrom the exciton excited state to the exciton ground state.\nThe population oscillations are also strongly damped due\nto dephasing processes which have been included in the\nsimulated oscillations [solid curves in Fig. 3(a)(b)],\nobtained from numerical integration of Eq.(1). The\nsource of the oscillation damping most likely originates\nin transitions to and from the wetting layer, whose\nformation can potentially be suppressed [20].\nUsing a y-polarized \u03c0-pre-pulse, the initial\ncondition \u03c1 yy (0) = 1 can be simulated. The second\n\n\u03c1 yy [Eq. (6)], and their difference, PL(x)-PL(y) almost\nvanishes [Fig. 3(c)].\nno pre-pulse\nr\ny \u03b5 (t )\n\ny\n\nx\n\n\u03b8\n\nt0\n\n\u03c0/4\n\n(b)\n\ny-pol.

The coarse delay between the pulses was fixed\nat 12 ps to prevent mutual temporal overlap while their\nphase delay was varied with a piezo-controlled fine-time\ndelay and the maxima (diamonds) and minima (squares)\nof PL(y) and PL(x) recorded [Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 3(e),\nrespectively]. The phase-averaged values <PL(x)> and\n<PL(y)> are also plotted [dashed curves in Fig. 3(d)(e)].\nThese represent the general trend for the population\ntransfer, namely the population of state |y\u3009 decreases at\nthe expense of |x\u3009, corresponding to the population\nswapping without direct transition described by Eq. (8)\nand Fig. 2(c). Numerical integration of Eq. (1), including\ndephasing, reproduces the envelopes of the oscillations\nreasonably well [solid curves in Fig. 3(e)(f)].\nThe complex dynamics of this population transfer\nhas its roots in the coupling between the \u041fx and \u041fy\ntransitions via the common ground state |v\u3009. The strength\nof this coupling can be represented by the normalized\nquantity fc = 1-(W1, max-W2, max)/(W1, max+W2, max). There is\nno coupling (fc=0) when \u03b1eff = 0 or \u03c0/2, in which case the\nV-type three-level system reduces to a two-level system.\nThe coupling reaches a maximum (fc=1) when \u03b1eff = \u03c0/4.\nThe difference of the third component of the two coupled\noptical Bloch vectors will then oscillate in the form\nW1(t)-W2(t)=(W1(t0)-W2(t0))cos(\u03b8eff/2) [Eq. (8)], with the\ninitial value set by the polarized pre-pulse. Indeed, this is\nwhat is observed experimentally and reflected in the\ndifference <PL(y)-PL(x)> between the polarized PL\nsignals [Fig. 2(f)].\nAs is well-known in SQDs, the anisotropic\nexchange interaction is responsible for the splitting of the\noriginally degenerate heavy-hole exciton spin states |mh\n= 3/2\u3009 and |mh = -3/2\u3009, into the states |x\u3009 = (|mh = 3/2\u3009 +\n\n<PL(y)-PL(x)> (a.u.)\n\nMax envelope\nMin envelope\nPL(y)-PL(x) (a.u.)\n\n(c)\n\n3\u03c0\n\n(f)\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n|x\u3009 |y\u3009\n\n|x\u3009 |y\u3009\n\n|x\u3009 |y\u3009\n\n|x\u3009 |y\u3009\n\n|x\u3009 |y\u3009\n\n|v\u3009\n\n|v\u3009\n\n|v\u3009\n\n|v\u3009\n\n|v\u3009\n\n3\u03c0\n\nFIG.. 3.

The coherent manipulation of the populations\nof |x\u3009 and |y\u3009 with tailored pulses is thus equivalent to a\nmanipulation of the exciton's spin state, with control\nover both phase and amplitude of the quantum states.\n\n4\n\n\fIn conclusion, we have examined both\ntheoretically and experimentally the exciton dynamics\narising under polarization-tailored two-pulse excitation\nof the V-system defined by the polarization eigenstates\n|x\u3009, |y\u3009 and the crystal ground state |v\u3009. This system is\nspecial in that the coupling between the otherwise\northogonal states |x\u3009 and |y\u3009 can be polarization-tuned.\nAlthough dephasing affects the detailed time-evolution,\nthe essential characteristics are captured by the analytic\nr\nsolution to the density matrix equations with \u0393, \u039b = 0.\nThe capabilities demonstrated here present an additional\nstep towards all-optical non-linear coherent control of a\nmultilevel excitonic system.\nWe gratefully thank Prof. L.
