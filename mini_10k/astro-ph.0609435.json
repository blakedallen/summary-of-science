Black hole lensing has been emerging\nas a pretty promising tool for gravitational investigations in both weak and strong fields. On the observational side, interest in\nthis topic is mainly motivated by the super-massive black hole supposed to be hosted in the radio source Sgr A* in the Galactic\ncenter. Planned high-resolution observations at the astrometric resolution of the microarcosecond (\u03bcas) should allow in the next\nfuture a clean detection of higher order effects in gravitational lensing. It is now well understood that a photon passing near a\nblack hole can suffer either a strong or a weak deflection. The latter occurs when the minimum distance is much larger than\nthe gravitational radius. The former occurs when photons wind around the black hole making one or more loops and producing\nimages very near to the shadow.\nAnalytical treatments have been worked out for generic spherically symmetric spacetimes, just assuming that the light ray\nfollows the geodesic equations. The deflection angle always diverges logarithmically when the minimum impact parameter is\nin the very neighborhood of complete capture [1], whereas for larger distances and in the weak deflection limit a Taylor series\nexpansion works pretty well [2]. Some investigations interpolating between the two limits have been also performed [3].\nWhereas lensing by either Schwarzschild or generic spherically symmetric black holes has been extensively investigated, a\nfull analytical description of lensing by a Kerr Black hole is still missing. An intrinsic angular momentum breaks the spherical\nsymmetry heavily affecting the gravitational field. The modern era in the study of Kerr geodesics came when Carter [4] was\nable to fully separate the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Based on this technique of separation of variables, many later investigations addressed the light propagation near a rotating body [5] and numerical studies flourished. Cunningham and Bardeen [6]\nconsidered the optical appearance of a point source in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of an extreme Kerr black hole.\nViergutz [7] investigated the image positions through a code based on the quasi-analytic solution of the geodesic problem by\nelliptical integrals. Rauch and Blandford [8] provided a detailed analysis of the optical structure of the primary caustic surface.\nThe analytical extension of the strong deflection limit methodology to the Kerr black hole has been performed as well in the\nlimit of small values of the angular momentum and for sources in the asymptotically flat region of the space-time [9\u201311]. A full\ndescription of caustics and the inversion of lens mapping for sources near them has been performed up to the second order in a.\nSeveral analytical investigations in the weak deflection limit, considering the first correction due to the angular momentum,\nwere performed in the past. The null tetrad formalism of geometrical optics was used to study the optical properties of images\ninto the field of an axisymmetric system [12]. Epstein and Shapiro [13] performed a calculation based on the post-Newtonian\nexpansion. The motion equations for two spinning point-like particles, when the spin and the mass of one of the particles\nwere zero, were resolved in [14, 15] by expanding the Kerr metric in a power series of the gravitational constant G. Bray [16]\nevaluated the equations of motion for a light ray in the weak deflection limit up to and including second order corrections in m/b\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: sereno@physik.unizh.ch\naddress: fadeluca@physik.unizh.ch\n\n\f2\ne a/b, where m is the black hole mass, a the angular momentum and b is the impact parameter. Dymnikova [17] discussed the\nadditional time-delay due to rotation by integrating the light geodesics. Glicenstein [18] considered light rays passing outside\na spinning star in the framework of the Lense-Thirring metric. Kopeikin and collaborators [19\u201321] investigated the gravitomagnetic effects in the propagation of light in the field of self-gravitating spinning bodies. Asada and Kasai [22] considered the\nlight deflection angle caused by an extended, slowly rotating lens. These analyses where then extended to generic spinning mass\ndistributions, in the usual framework of gravitational lensing theory [23\u201328], i.e. i) weak field and slow motion approximation\nfor the lens and ii) thin lens hypothesis. Expressions for bending and time delay of electromagnetic waves were found for\nstationary rotating deflectors with general mass distributions.\nAt second order in m/b and a/b, the Kerr lens is observationally equivalent to the Schwarzschild one because of the invariance\nunder the global translation of the center of the lens mass [22]. In this paper we take a step forward and study the lensing up to\nthe next order. Following Bray [16], we start from the lightlike null geodesics and then move to the gravitational lensing for a\nconfiguration in which both source and observer lie in the asymptotically flat region of the spacetime. We take care of expressing\nthe results in terms of the invariants of the light ray, avoiding ambiguities connected to coordinate-dependent quantities [2, 29].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce our notation and recall some properties of the Kerr spacetime.\nIn Section III, the lens equations in the weak deflection limit are derived starting from the geodesics. Section IV is devoted to\nthe solution of the lens equations with a perturbative method. Sections V and VI discuss the magnification of the images and the\nsingularity of the lens mapping, respectively. Section VII is devoted to some considerations. Finally, Appendixes A and B report\nsome details on the evaluation of the integrals appearing in the geodesic equations. In this paper, we will use units G = c = 1,\nwith c the light speed in the vacuum.\nII.\n\nBASICS\n\nThe Kerr black hole metric in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, {t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6}, is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nrSch r\n\u03c12\narSch r sin2 \u03b8\na2 rSch r sin2 \u03b8\nds2 = 1 \u2212 2\ndt2 \u2212 dr2 \u2212 \u03c12 d\u03b82 \u2212 r2 + a2 +\nsin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 +\ndtd\u03c6,\n2\n\u03c1\n\u2206\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03c12 \u2261 r2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8,\n\u2206 \u2261 r2 + rSch r + a2 .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe constant rSch = 2m is the gravitational radius. We consider a static observer and a static emitter in the asymptotically flat\nregion of the spacetime, r \u226b rSch . The observer coordinates are denoted {ro , \u03b8o , \u03c6o = 0}, where \u03c6o has been fixed without loss\nof generality. The source coordinates are denoted as {rs , \u03b8s , \u03c6s }. In what follows, we will also use the modified polar coordinate\n\u03bc \u2261 cos \u03b8. The null geodesics for a light ray can be expressed in terms of the first integrals of motion J and Q [4, 5]. The\nphoton trajectory from the source to the observer can then be written as\nZ\nZ\nd\u03b8\ndr\n(4)\n\u00b1 \u221a = \u00b1 \u221a ,\nR\n\u0398\nZ\nZ\nJd\u03b8\na (rSch r \u2212 aJ)\n\u221a\n\u221a ,\ndr +\n(5)\n\u2212\u03c6s =\n\u00b1\u2206 R\n\u00b1 sin2 \u03b8 \u0398\nwhere\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR(r) \u2261 r4 + a2 \u2212 J 2 \u2212 Q r2 + (J \u2212 a)2 + Q rSch r \u2212 a2 Q,\n\u0001\n\u0398(\u03b8) \u2261 a2 \u2212 J 2 csc2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 + Q.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe signs of R and \u0398 are adhered to the signs of dr and d\u03b8, respectively. The signs change at the inversion points in the r\nor \u03b8-motion. We consider the standard framework of gravitational lensing, where the source of radiation and the observer are\nremote from the lens. In such a configuration the equatorial plane is crossed at least once, so that the range Q < 0 is excluded in\nour analysis.\nAlong his path from the source to the observer, the photon passes by the black hole at a minimum distance rmin which, in\nthe weak deflection limit, is much larger than the gravitational radius. This distance of closest approach is the only turning\npoint in the r-motion. Differently from the strong deflection limit, when the photon may perform several oscillations around\nthe equatorial plane, in the weak deflection limit there is just one inversion point also in the angular polar motion. \u03b8 can attain\neither a maximum or a minimum depending on the direction taken by the photon starting from \u03b8s . If \u03b8 is initially growing (\u03bc\n\n\f3\ndecreasing), the polar motion will attain a maximum \u03b8max (a minimum \u03bc) and then it will decrease to get to the observer at \u03b8o\n(\u03bc increases to get to \u03bco ), otherwise for an initially decreasing \u03b8.\nThe light ray minimum radial distance rmin to the lens is determined by R(r) = 0, whose roots represent inversion points in\nthe radial motion. In general, there can be up to four real roots with rmin being the largest one. In the weak deflection limit, there\nis just one inversion point at a distance of order of the impact parameter [16]. The impact parameter is an invariant of motion\ndefined geometrically by the perpendicular distance from thep\ncenter of the lens to the asymptotic tangent line to the light ray at\nthe observer. For the spherically symmetric case it reduces to J 2 + Q. A fundamental assumption\nin the weak deflection limit\np\nis that the point of closest approach lies well outside the gravitational radius, i.e. rSch \u226a J 2 + Q. Let us now introduce two\nindependent expansion parameters in terms of the invariants of motion\nm\n,\n\u01ebm = p\nJ2 + Q\na\n.\n\u01eba = p\n2\nJ +Q\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nIn what follows, we will expand quantities of interest in both \u01ebm and \u01eba . For the sake of brevity, we will refer to terms of order\nO(\u01ebim \u01ebja ) as terms of order O(\u01ebn ) with n = i + j . We will produce our results up to a given formal order in \u01eb, collecting terms\nof a given order in \u01eb coming from any combination of the two quantities \u01eba and \u01ebm . We recall how terms like O(a m) or O(m2 ),\nwhich according to our notation are both of formal order \u223c \u01eb2 , are not necessarily of the same physical order. This is the case\nonly for a maximal (or nearly maximal) Kerr black hole, when |a| \u223c m.\nLet us find the minimum radial distance in the weak deflection limit. We can solve the equation R(rmin ) = 0 expressing rmin\nas a power series in \u01eb.

Eq. (10) for the spherical symmetric case\n(a = 0) agrees with the result in [2]. The observer and the source lie very far from the lens in the asymptotically flat region of\nthe spacetime. It can be shown that b/ro \u223c b/rs \u223c \u01ebm [2]. This scaling relation will be useful when collecting terms rmin /ro\nand rmin /rs in the integrals. In what follows, without loss of generality, we will consider non negative values of the spin a.\nIII. LENS EQUATIONS\n\nThe geodesic equations, Eqs. (4, 5) will provide the lens equations. They can be viewed as a map between the angular position\nof the source, {\u03bcs , \u03c6s }, and the image position, which is a function of the couple of invariants {J, Q}. Details on the resolution\nof the radial and angular integrals in the weak deflection limit are given in Appendix A and B, respectively. Following [16], we\ncan recast the geodesic equation in a quite compact form. The first equation, Eq.

For a null angular momentum (a = 0) and for very distant source and observer,\nro , rs \u2192 \u221e, the parameter \u03b4 reduces to the deflection angle induced by the Schwarzschild black hole [2]. The parameter k in\nEq. (11) accounts for the direction in the polar motion of the photon at the observer. k is even (odd) if \u03b8 attains \u03b8max (\u03b8min ), i.e\nfor photons coming from below (above) the black hole.\nThe second geodesic equation, Eq.

(13, 14) have been already evaluated in [16].\nThe lens equation are usually given in terms of the apparent angular position of the image onto the plane of the sky (POS),\ni.e. the coordinate angles {\u03b81 , \u03b82 }, and of the angular position of the source in absence of the lens, {B1 , B2 }. In the asymptotic\nflat region, the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates can be thought as spherical coordinates. We can introduce a Cartesian observer\ncoordinate system centered on the black hole, with the x3 -axis running along the line of sight (LOS), i.e. the line from the\nobserver to the lens, and the x2 -axis tracing the projection of the spin axis onto the POS. Then, \u03b81 and \u03b82 are measured along\nthe x1 - and the x2 -axis, respectively. In other words, ro tan \u03b81 and ro tan \u03b82 are the apparent (length-)displacement of the image\nperpendicular to the projected axis of symmetry of the black hole and the apparent (length-)displacement perpendicular to the\nequatorial plane in the sense of the angular momentum of the black hole, respectively. The angles {\u03b81 , \u03b82 } are strictly linked to\nthe invariants of motion and to the impact parameter through the relations\ntan \u03b81\nJ\nro \u221a\n= \u2212p\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2o\n1 + tan2 \u03b8\ns\n\u03bc2o\ntan \u03b82\nk\n2 \u03bc2 \u2212 J 2\n,\nro \u221a\n=\n\u2212(\u22121)\nQ\n+\na\no\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2o\n1 + tan2 \u03b8\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwith \u03b8 being the angular separation of the image from the black hole, tan2 \u03b8 = tan2 \u03b81 + tan2 \u03b82 . The parameter k can be\nexpressed in terms of \u03b82 as\n(\u22121)k = \u2212\n\n\u03b82\n.\n|\u03b82 |\n\n(17)\n\nEquations (15, 16) can be obtained by defining the tangent to the ray at the observer through the equations of motion of the\nphoton. Photons are named prograde (retrograde) if they turn on the equatorial plane in the same (opposite) sense of the black\nhole. Prograde photons (J > 0, Q = 0) are seen by the observer on the left side of the black hole (\u03b8p\n1 < 0). The relation between\nthe angular position of the image and the impact parameter for a spherically symmetric lens, b = J 2 + Q = ro sin \u03b8, can be\neasily recovered from Eqs. (15, 16)\nThe angular position of the source {B1 , B2 } can be expressed in terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Considering the\nintercept of the line through the source and the observer with the POS, we find\np\nDs tan B1 = sin \u03c6s rs 1 \u2212 \u03bc2s ,\n(18)\n\u0010 p\n\u0011\np\n(19)\nDs tan B2 = rs \u03bcs 1 \u2212 \u03bc2o \u2212 \u03bco 1 \u2212 \u03bc2s cos \u03c6s ,\nwhere Ds is the distance along the LOS from the observer to the plane of the source, i.e. the plane through the source and\nperpendicular to the LOS.

The Di distances must be properly intended as\nangular diameter distances. The relations in Eqs. (15, 16) and Eqs. (18, 19) allows us to put the geodesics, Eqs. (11, 13), in the\nclassical form of the lens mapping\nB1 = B1 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ),\nB2 = B2 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ).\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nOnce we use angular coordinates for the image positions instead on the invariants of motion, it can be appropriate to introduce a\nseries expansion parameter in the weak deflection limit based on the angular Einstein ring,\nr\nrs\n.\n(25)\n\u03b8E \u2261 2rSch\nro (ro + rs )\nFollowing [2], we define\n\u03b8E\n,\n(26)\n4D\nwhere D \u2261 rs /(ro + rs ). We remark as differently from usual analyses in the weak deflection limit, we are adopting radial\ndistances in the definition of the Einstein radius instead of the distances measured along the LOS. Differences are of order of \u03b53 .\nAngles can be rescaled in terms of \u03b8E . We then assume that the solution of the lens equations can be written as a series in \u03b5,\n\b\n(27)\n\u03b81 = \u03b8E \u03b81(0) + \u03b81(1) \u03b5 + \u03b81(2) \u03b52 + O(\u03b53 ) ,\n\b\n2\n3\n(28)\n\u03b82 = \u03b8E \u03b82(0) + \u03b82(1) \u03b5 + \u03b82(2) \u03b5 + O(\u03b5 ) ,\n\b\n2\n3\n(29)\n\u03b8 = \u03b8E \u03b8(0) + \u03b8(1) \u03b5 + \u03b8(2) \u03b5 + O(\u03b5 ) .\n\u03b5\u2261\n\nThe above expressions must be read with the same caveats we discussed about the parameter \u01eb after introducing the proper\nexpansion parameters \u01ebm and \u01eba in Eqs. (8, 9). As a matter of fact, a coefficient of the form \u03b8(i) will be written as a polynomial\nof i-th order in a/m, collecting terms which are not necessarily of the same order.\nThe source position can be rescaled defining\n\u03b2i \u2261\n\ntan Bi\n.\n\u03b8E\n\n(30)\n\nIncluding terms up to \u223c \u03b52 , the lens equations take the very simple form\n\nB1 = \u03b81 \u2212 D\u03b1\u03021 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ),\nB2 = \u03b82 \u2212 D\u03b1\u03022 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ),\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u0302 is the bending angle, defined as the angle between the asymptotic direction of the light ray at the observer and the\nasymptotic direction at the emitter. At order \u223c \u03b53 , equations become more complicated. The deflection angle is an invariant of\nmotion and can be expressed in terms of the constants J and Q together with the mass and the spin of the black hole. On the\nother hand, by its own definition, it does not depend on the source and observer positions once they lie in the very asymptotic\nregion of spacetime. The source position can then be directly related to the deflection angle considering source and observer at\nan infinite distance. This allows us to neglect higher order contributions to the path of the light ray near the black hole. The\ntwo components of the deflection angle can then be evaluated considering the geodesics for source and observer Eqs. (11, 12) at\nro , rs \u2192 \u221e, through the equation\nDds\ntan \u03b1\u0302i .\n(33)\nDs\nIt is simple to verify that for an equatorial motion, \u03bcs = \u03bco = 0, Eq.

For the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole, Eqs. (34, 35) agree with the result\nin [2]. The spin enters in the deflection angle only if coupled with the mass. A first attempt to evaluate the term proportional to\nm2 a in the deflection angle was already performed in [30]. We remark as in the derivation in [30], some higher order geometrical\nterms are neglected or, in other words, angles are identified with their tangents. This can affect the relation between the impact\nparameter and the distance of closest approach. The discussion of the equatorial motion, b2 = 0, \u03bco = 0 is enough to understand\nsome features of how the spin affects the deflection angle. We have\n2\nrSch b1\n16 \u0010 rSch \u00113 b1\n15\u03c0 \u0010 rSch \u00112 b1\narSch\na2 rSch b1\n5\u03c0 arSch\n\u03b1\u03021 = 2\n+ O(\u01eb4 ).\n(38)\n+\n+2 2 +\n+\n+\nb b\n16\nb\nb\nb\n3\nb\nb\nb3 b\n2 b3\nWhereas the gravito-electric field is always attractive, the gravito-magnetic field attracts towards the black hole only photons\nwhich move in the equatorial plane in the opposite sense of the spinning lens (b1 > 0) . Terms directly proportional to the\nangular momentum a are strictly related to the dragging of inertial frames and then act differentially on opposite sides of the\nhole. The deflection angle is enhanced for retrograde photons (b1 > 0) and reduced for prograde photons (b1 < 0). The term\nproportional to a2 is instead related to the quadrupolar distortion caused by the black hole spin [8]. It just perturbs the spherical\nsymmetry of the system but it does not act differentially.\nTo give some numerical estimates, let us consider Sgr A* in the Galactic center, at nearly 8 Kpc from the Sun, which should\nhost a supermassive black hole with mass \u223c 3.6 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 [31]. The minimum distance of orbiting stars from the central\nblack hole is >\n\u223c 100 AU, nearly 1500 times greater than the Schwarzschild radius, so that such sources can be considered in the\nasymptotic region of the spacetime. The Einstein radius corresponding to such a configuration is \u223c 0.5 mas, i.e nearly 4 AU\n(\u223c 50 rSch ) at the distance of Sgr A*. Let us consider a light ray in the equatorial plane with an impact parameter of \u223c 50 rSch .\nThe total deflection angle is \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 radians, so that the weak deflection limit still holds. The size of the contribution to the\ndeflection due to the dragging term \u221d a m (\u221d a m2 ) is \u223c 80(a/m) as (6(a/m) as). The contribution of the term \u221d a2 m is\n\u223c 0.8(a/m)2 as. We see that corrections are sizeable even for low values of the angular momentum.\nIV. IMAGE POSITIONS\n\nLens equations can be solved term by term. At the first order in the deflection angle, Kerr lensing is pure Schwarzschild\nlensing. The lens equations take the standard form\n!\n1\n\u03b21 = \u03b81(0) 1 \u2212 2\n,\n(39)\n\u03b8(0)\n!\n1\n\u03b22 = \u03b82(0) 1 \u2212 2\n,\n(40)\n\u03b8(0)\nq\n2 , with the usual solutions\n2\n+ \u03b82(0)\nwhere \u03b8(0) = \u03b81(0)\n\u00b1\n\u03b81(0)\n\u00b1\n\u03b82(0)\n\nr\n\u0012\n1\u00b1 1+\nr\n\u0012\n1\n=\n1\u00b1 1+\n2\n\n1\n=\n2\n\n4\n\u03b22\n4\n\u03b22\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\n\u03b21 ,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03b22 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwith \u03b2 2 \u2261 \u03b212 + \u03b222 .\nThe first contribution of the angular momentum appears at the next order in \u03b5.

The lens equations are degenerate as well with those of a binary\npoint-like lens with very short separation. Then, at this order, the line joining the perturbed images always goes through the\n'shifted' Schwarzschild lens. What happens in the POS is that, due to a positive angular momentum, the two images are\napparently counterclockwisely rotated about the line of sight through the centre with respect to the line passing through the near\nunperturbed image produced in the Schwarzschild case [25].\nSuppose a source at a distance rs \u223c 10 pc beyond the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center and an Earth-based\nobserver.

Lensing\nby rotating objects has been considered a number of times in the past and with very different approaches. Here, we built up the\nlens equations starting from the geodesics for light rays and then solved for the lensing quantities with a standard perturbative\n2\ntechnique. This method allowed us to consider corrections proportional to a2 rSch and arSch\n. We showed as pure spin terms\n2\n3\n\u221d a , a do not contribute to the observable lensing quantities, in particular to the deflection angle.\nUp to the first order correction in the spin, the Kerr lens is equivalent to a displaced Schwarzschild deflector. This is a very\ngeneral property of spinning lenses [23]. To the next order, this degeneracy is broken and some particular features show up. The\ntwo perturbed images are no more aligned with a fixed position. The degeneracy between the absolute value of the spin and its\ninclination on the line of sight is also broken. All observable quantities at the first order correction in the spin are functions of\na sin \u03b8o but terms proportional to a cos \u03b8o appear at the next order in the angular coordinates of the images in the plane of the\nsky. However, the angular displacement of the images from the center is still a function of a sin \u03b8o . The shape of the critical\ncurve is still a circle displaced along the equatorial direction and the caustic is still point-like. The finite size of the caustic should\n2\nshow up at the next order due to terms \u221d a2 rSch\nas suggested by numerical results [8].\nIt could be of interest to draw some comparison with the case of the strong deflection limit [9\u201311]. Such a limit has been treated\nconsidering small values of the angular momentum and including corrections proportional to a2 . That is two orders beyond the\nSchwarzschild lens. This was enough to obtain finite shaped caustics. In the present study of the weak deflection limit, we made\nno assumptions on the absolute value of the spin and still considered two orders beyond the spherically symmetric lens but we\ndid non get the caustic structure. This is only an apparent discrepancy, as we have to remind that the minimum distance in the\nstrong deflection limit is of order of the gravitational radius. In fact the finite size of the caustic springs from terms proportional\n2\n4\nto (a2 rSch\n)/rmin\n. Since in the strong deflection limit rmin \u223c rSch , we see as these terms are included in an analysis at the second\norder in a.\nIf the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center has a significant angular momentum, some features of Kerr lensing could\nbe detected by future space astrometric mission with a planned resolution of the microarcsecond.\nIn a forthcoming paper we will present an analytical treatment of Kerr lensing in the weak deflection limit accounting for the\ncaustic structure.\nAcknowledgments\n\nM.S. is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and by the Tomalla Foundation.

Let us start with some considerations\non the radial integrals. The sign convention in the geodesic equations remind us that integrations must be performed summing\n\n\f11\nup with the same sign all contributions from paths bounded by consecutive inversion points. For a standard gravitational lensing\nconfiguration, the r-motion, rs \u2192 rmin \u2192 ro , has only one inversion point so that we have to add the contributions due to the\napproach and the departure of the photon. Integrals can be easily evaluated expanding the integrand as a Taylor series in \u01eb and\nthen performing\np the integrationpterm by term. When evaluating the expanded primitive function in the extrema rs and ro , we\nremind that J 2 + Q/rs and J 2 + Q/ro are of order of \u01eb. Let us first consider the left-hand side of Eq. (4). The integral\nreads\nZ rs\nZ ro\ndr\n2\ndr\n\u03c0\n\u221a +\n\u221a \u2243 p\n+ 2\nrSch\n(A1)\n2\nR\nR\nJ +Q J +Q\nrmin\nrmin\n\u0001\n2\na2 \u03c0 2J 2 \u2212 Q\n4JarSch\n15\u03c0rSch\n\u2212\n+\n2 +\n3/2\n5/2\n(J 2 + Q)\n16 (J 2 + Q)\n4 (J 2 + Q)\n\u0001\n3\n2\na4 6J 2 \u2212 2Q rSch\n16rSch\n15aJ\u03c0rSch\n+\n+\n2 \u2212\n3\n5/2\n3 (J 2 + Q)\n(J 2 + Q)\n4 (J 2 + Q)\n\u2212\n\nJ2 + Q J2 + Q\n1\n1\n\u2212 .\n\u2212\n\u2212\n3\n3\n6ro\n6rs\nr0\nrs\n\nLet us now consider the radial integral in the right hand side of Eq.

(A2) of order \u223c \u01eb4 . We remark as radial integrals can be more easily solved\nchanging to the variable u = rmin /r.\nAPPENDIX B: ANGULAR INTEGRALS\n\nThe angular integrals follow the photon polar trajectory from the source, \u03b8s , to the turning point, which is either the minimum\n\u03b8min or the maximum \u03b8max , to the observer at \u03b8o . As for the radial motion, the integration is a path integral over the whole\ntrajectory of the photon with all contributions\nto be summed with the same sign. The two branches, i.e \u03b8s \u2192 (\u03b8min , \u03b8max ) \u2192 \u03b8o\n\u221a\nsum up positively if we take the sign of \u0398 to be positive (negative) if integrating from \u03b8s to \u03b8max (\u03b8min ) and negative (positive)\nfrom \u03b8max (\u03b8min ) to \u03b8o . It is useful to change to \u03bc \u2261 cos \u03b8. The right hand side of Eq. (4) can be then rewritten as\nZ\n1\np d\u03bc,\nI\u03bc =\n(B1)\n\u00b1 \u0398\u03bc\nwhere\n\n\u0398\u03bc \u2261 a2 (\u03bc2\u2212 + \u03bc2 )(\u03bc2+ \u2212 \u03bc2 ),\nq\nb2JQ + 4a2 Qm \u00b1 bJQ\n,\n\u03bc2\u00b1 \u2261\n2a2\nbJQ = a2 \u2212 J 2 \u2212 Q.\nThe turning point in the polar motion is a zero of \u0398\u03bc , i.e. \u00b1\u03bc+ , with \u03bc+ corresponding to \u03b8min .

We remark as the integral in Eq. (B1) can be more easily solved in terms of the\nintegration variable \u03bc/\u03bc+ [5, 11, 16]. The function in Eq. (B6) can be expanded as\n(\n\"\n#\n)\n2J 2 \u2212 Q(1 \u2212 \u03bc2\u03c3 )\n\u03bc\u03c3\na2\n1\nQ \u2212 2J 2\n\u22121\n\u22121\np\nsin \u03bc\u03c3 \u2212\n,\n(B7)\nsin \u03bc\u03c3\nP I(\u03bc) \u2243 p\n+\n4(J 2 + Q)\n4(J 2 + Q)\nJ2 + Q\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2\u03c3\nJ2 + Q\n\np\nwith \u03bc\u03c3 \u2261 \u03bc/ Q/(J 2 + Q).

We remind that \u03bc is a decreasing function of \u03b8 so that the considerations on the signs must be accordingly updated. Using\nthe property that P I(\u2212\u03bc+ ) = \u2212P I(\u03bc+ ) and following the sign convention sum, we sum up the paths as\n\nwith k an integer number defined to be even (odd) if the photon gets to the observer from below (from the top), i.e. after having\nreached \u03b8max (\u03b8min ).\nLet us now consider the angular integral in the right hand side of Eq.
