Otherwise, well-behaved energy sources (positive energy density) that violate NDEC\n(necessarily negative pressure), have EOS parameter less\nthan minus unity [3]. NDEC-violating sources are being investigated as possible dark energy (DE) candidates\nand have been called as \"phantom\" components [4, 5].[27]\nSince NDEC prevents instability of the vacuum or propagation of energy outside the light cone, then, phantom models are intrinsically unstable. Nevertheless, if\nthought of as effective field theories (valid up to a given\nmomentum cutoff), these models could be phenomenologically viable [3]. Another very strange property of\nphantom universes is that their entropy is negative[6].\nTo the number of unwanted properties of a phantom component with \"supernegative\" EOS parameter\n\u03c9ph = pph /\u03c1ph < \u22121, we add the fact that its energy density \u03c1ph increases in an expanding universe.[28]\nThis property ultimately leads to a catastrophic (future)\nbig rip singularity[8] that is characterized by divergences\nin the scale factor a, the Hubble parameter H and its\ntime-derivative \u1e22[10]. Although other kinds of singularity might occur in scenarios with phantom energy, in\nthe present paper we are interested only in the big rip\nkind of singularity.[29] This singularity is at a finite\n\namount of proper time into the future but, before it is\nreached, the phantom energy will rip apart all bound\nstructures, including molecules, atoms and nuclei. To\navoid this catastrophic event (also called \"cosmic doomsday\"), some models and/or mechanisms have been invoked. In Ref.[12], for instance, it has been shown that\nthis singularity in the future of the cosmic evolution\nmight be avoided or, at least, made milder if quantum\neffects are taken into consideration. Instead, a suitable\nperturbation of de Sitter equation of state can also lead to\nclassical evolution free of the big rip [13]. Gravitational\nback reaction effects[14] and scalar fields with negative\nkinetic energy term with self interaction potentials with\nmaxima[3, 15], have also been considered .\nAnother way to avoid the unwanted big rip singularity\nis to allow for a suitable interaction between the phantom energy and the background (DM) fluid[16, 17]. [30]\nIn effect, if there is transfer of energy from the phantom\ncomponent to the background fluid, it is possible to arrange the free parameters of the model, in such a way\nthat the energy densities of both components decrease\nwith time, thus avoiding the big rip[16]. Models with interaction between the phantom and the DM components\nare also appealing since the coincidence problem (why\nthe energy densities of dark matter and dark energy are\nof the same order precisely at present?) can be solved or,\nat least, smoothed out[16, 17, 20].\nAim of the present paper is, precisely, to study models\nwith interaction between the phantom (DE) and background components of the cosmological fluid but, un-\n\nerence [11].\n[30] Although experimental tests in the solar system impose severe\nrestrictions on the possibility of non-minimal coupling between\n\u2217 Electronic address: rcurbelo@uclv.edu.cu;tame@uclv.edu.cu;genly@uclv.edu.cu;israel@uclv.edu.cu\nthe DE and ordinary matter fluids [18], due to the unknown nature of the DM as part of the background, it is possible to have\n[27] That NDEC-violating sources can occur has been argued decades\nadditional (non gravitational) interactions between the dark enago, for instance, in reference [9].\nergy component and dark matter, without conflict with the ex[28] Alternatives to phantom models to account for supernegative\nperimental data. It should be pointed out, however, that when\nEOS parameter have been considered also. See, for instance,\nthe stability of DE potentials in quintessence models is considreferences [7]\n[29] A detailed study of the kinds of singularity might occur in phanered, the coupling dark matter-dark energy is troublesome [19].\ntom scenarios (including the big rip) has been the target of refPerhaps, the argument might be extended to phantom models.\n\n\f2\nlike the phenomenological approach followed in other\ncases to specify the interaction term (see references\n[16, 17]), we start with a general form of the interaction that is inspired in scalar-tensor (ST) theories of\ngravity. We concentrate our investigation on solutions\nthat are free of the coincidence problem. In this paper no specific model for the phantom energy is assumed. A flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe (ds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2 \u03b4ij dxi dxj ; i, j = 1, 2, 3) is considered that is filled with a mixture of two interacting fluids: the background (mainly DM) with a linear equation\nof state pm = \u03c9m \u03c1m , \u03c9m = const.,[31] and the phantom\nfluid with EOS parameter \u03c9ph = pph /\u03c1ph < \u22121. Additionally we consider the \"ratio function\":\nr=\n\n\u03c1m\n,\n\u03c1ph\n\n(1)\n\nbetween the energy densities of both fluids. It is, in fact,\nno more than a useful parametrization. We assume that\nr can be written as function of the scale factor.\nThe paper has been organized in the following way: In\nSection 2 we develop a general formalism that is adequate\nto study the kind of coupling between phantom energy\nand the background fluid (inspired in ST theories as said)\nwe want to investigate. Models of references [16, 17] can\nbe treated as particular cases. The way one can escape\none of the most undesirable features of any DE model:\nthe coincidence problem, is discussed in Section 3 for the\ncase of interest, where the DE is modelled by a phantom\nfluid. In this section it is also briefly discussed under\nwhich conditions the big rip singularity might be avoided.\nWith the help of the formalism developed before, in Section 4, particular models with interaction between the\ncomponents of the mixture are investigated where the\ncoincidence problem is solved. The cases with constant\nand dynamical EOS parameter are studied separately. It\nis found that, in all cases, there is a wide range in parameter space, where the solutions are free of the big\nrip singularity also. It is argued that observational data\nseems to favor phantom models without big rip singularity. This conclusion is reinforced by a physical argument\nrelated to the possibility that the interaction term is always bounded. Conclusions are given in Section 5.\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM\n\nSince there is exchange of energy between the phantom\nand the background fluids, the energy is not conserved\n\n[31] Although baryons, which should be left uncoupled or weakly coupled to be consistent with observations, are a non vanishing but\nsmall part of the background, these are not being considered\nhere for sake of simplicity. Also there are suggestive arguments\nshowing that observational bounds on the \"fifth\" force do not\nnecessarily imply decoupling of baryons from DE[21].\n\nseparately for each component. Instead, the continuity\nequation for each fluid shows a source (interaction) term:\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H(\u03c1m + pm ) = Q,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c1\u0307ph + 3H(\u03c1ph + pph ) = \u2212Q,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the dot accounts for derivative with respect to the\ncosmic time and Q is the interaction term. Note that\nthe total energy density \u03c1T = \u03c1m + \u03c1ph (pT = pm + pph )\nis indeed conserved: \u03c1\u0307T + 3H(\u03c1T + pT ) = 0. To specify\nthe general form of the interaction term, we look at a\nscalar-tensor theory of gravity where the matter degrees\nof freedom and the scalar field are coupled in the action\nthrough the scalar-tensor metric \u03c7(\u03c6)\u22121 gab [22]:\nZ\np\nR 1\nSST = d4 x |g|{ \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6)2\n2\n2\n\u22122\n\u22121\n+ \u03c7(\u03c6) Lm (\u03bc, \u2207\u03bc, \u03c7 gab )},\n(4)\nwhere \u03c7(\u03c6)\u22122 is the coupling function, Lm is the matter\nLagrangian and \u03bc is the collective name for the matter\ndegrees of freedom. It can be shown that, in terms of\nthe coupling function \u03c7(\u03c6), the interaction term Q in\nequations (2) and (3), can be written in the following\nform:\nQ = \u03c1m H[a\n\nd(ln \u03c7\u0304)\n],\nda\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we have introduced the following \"reduced\" notation: \u03c7\u0304(a) \u2261 \u03c7(a)(3\u03c9m \u22121)/2 and it has been assumed\nthat the coupling can be written as a function of the\nscale factor \u03c7\u0304 = \u03c7\u0304(a).[32] This is the general form of the\ninteraction we consider in the present paper.[33] Comparing this with other interaction terms in the bibliography, one can obtain the functional form of the coupling function \u03c7\u0304 in each case. In Ref.[16], for instance,\nQ = 3Hc2 (\u03c1ph + \u03c1m ) = 3c2 H\u03c1m (r + 1)/r, where c2 denotes the transfer strength. If one compares this expression with (5) one obtains the following coupling function:\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 e3\n\nR\n\n2\nda r+1\na ( r )c\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u03040 is an arbitrary integration constant.\nIf\nc2 = c20 = const. and r = r0 = const., then \u03c7\u0304 =\n2\n\u03c7\u03040 a3c0 (r0 +1)/r0 . Another example is the interaction term\n\n[32] If SST represents Brans-Dicke theory formulated in\nthe Einstein\np frame, then the coupling function \u03c7(\u03c6) =\n\u03c70 exp (\u2212\u03c6/ \u03c9 + 3/2). The dynamics of such a theory but, for\na standard scalar field with exponential self-interaction potential\nhas been studied, for instance, in Ref.[23]. For a phantom scalar\nfield it has been studied in [24].\n[33] We recall that we do not consider any specific model for the\nphantom field so, the scalar-tensor theory given by the action\nSST serves just as inspiration for specifying the general form of\nthe interaction term Q.\n\n\f3\nin Ref. [17]: Q = \u03b4H\u03c1m , where \u03b4 is a dimensionless coupling function. It is related with the coupling function \u03c7\u0304\n(Eqn. (5)) through:\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 e\n\nR\n\nda\na \u03b4\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nand, for \u03b4 = \u03b40 ; \u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 a\u03b40 .\nIf one substitutes (5) in (2), then the last equation can\nbe integrated:\n\u03c1m = \u03c1m,0 a\u22123(\u03c9m +1) \u03c7\u0304,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c1m,0 is an arbitrary integration constant.\nIf one considers Eqn. (1) then, Eqn.(3) can be arranged in the form: \u03c1\u0307ph /\u03c1ph + 3(\u03c9ph \u2212 1)H = (3\u03c9m \u2212\n1)rH[ad(ln \u03c7\u22121/2 )/da] or, after integrating:\nZ\nda\nd(ln \u03c7\u0304)\n\u03c1ph = \u03c1ph,0 exp{\u2212\n[1 + 3\u03c9ph + ra\n]}, (9)\na\nda\nwhere \u03c1ph,0 is another integration constant. Using equations (8), (1) and (9), it can be obtained an equation\nrelating the coupling function \u03c7\u0304, the phantom EOS parameter \u03c9ph and the \"ratio function\" r:\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (\n\nR\nr\n)e\u22123\nr+1\n\nda \u03c9ph \u2212\u03c9m\na (\nr+1\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere, as before, \u03c7\u03040 is an integration constant. Therefore, by the knowledge of \u03c9ph = \u03c9ph (a) and r = r(a),\none can describe the dynamics of the model under study.\nActually, if \u03c9ph and r are given as functions of the scale\nfactor, then one can integrate in Eqn. (10) to obtain\n\u03c7\u0304 = \u03c7\u0304(a) and, consequently, \u03c1m = \u03c1m (a) is given through\nEqn. (8). The energy density of the phantom field can\nbe computed through either relationship (1) or (9). Besides, the Friedmann equation can be rewritten in terms\nof r and one of the energy densities:\n3H 2 = \u03c1ph (1 + r) = \u03c1m (\n\n1+r\n),\nr\n\n(11)\n\nso, the Hubble parameter H = H(a) is also known. Due\nto Eqn.(11), the (dimensionless) density parameters \u03a9i =\n\u03c1i /3H 2 (\u03a9m + \u03a9ph = 1) are given in terms of only r:\n\u03a9ph =\n\nr\n1\n, \u03a9m =\n,\n1+r\n1+r\n\n(12)\n\nrespectively. It is useful to rewrite Eqn.(10), alternatively, in terms of \u03a9ph and \u03c9ph :\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (1 \u2212 \u03a9ph ) e\u22123\n\nR\n\nda\na (\u03c9ph \u2212\u03c9m )\u03a9ph\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nAnother useful parameter (to judge whether or not the\nexpansion if accelerated), is the deceleration parameter\nq = \u2212(1+ \u1e22/H 2 ), that is given by the following equation:\n3 \u03c9ph + 1 + (\u03c9m + 1)r\n],\nq = \u22121 + [\n2\n1+r\n\n(14)\n\nor, in terms of \u03a9ph and \u03c9ph :\nq=\n\n1\n[1 + 3\u03c9m + 3(\u03c9ph \u2212 \u03c9m )\u03a9ph ].\n2\n\n(15)\n\nWhen the EOS parameter of the phantom field is a\nconstant \u03c9ph = \u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) < \u22121, \u03be 2 \u2208 R+ , we need to\nspecify only the behavior of the ratio function r = r(a)\nor, equivalently, of the phantom density parameter \u03a9ph =\n\u03a9ph (a). In this case the equation for determining of the\ncoupling function \u03c7\u0304 (10) or, alternatively, (13), can be\nwritten in either form:\nR\n2\nda\nr\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (\n(16)\n) e3(1+\u03be +\u03c9m ) a(r+1) ,\nr+1\nor,\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (1 \u2212 \u03a9ph ) e3(1+\u03be\n\n2\n\n+\u03c9m )\n\nR\n\nda\na \u03a9ph\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nThe deceleration parameter is given, in this case, by q =\n\u22121 + (3/2)[(r \u2212 \u03be 2 )/(r + 1)] so, to obtain accelerated\nexpansion r < 2 + 3\u03be 2 .\nIII.\n\nAVOIDING THE COINCIDENCE PROBLEM\n\nIn this section we discuss the way in which one of the\nmost undesirable features of any DE model (including the\nphantom) can be avoided or evaded. For completeness\nwe briefly discuss also the conditions under which the\ndoomsday event can be evaded.\nA.\n\nHow to avoid the coincidence problem?\n\nIt is interesting to discuss, in the general case, under which conditions the coincidence problem might be\navoided in models with interaction among the components in the mixture. In this sense one expects that a\nregime with simultaneous non zero values of the density parameters of the interacting components is a critical point of the corresponding dynamical system, so the\nsystem lives in this state for a sufficiently long period of\ntime and, hence, the coincidence does not arises.\nIn the present case where we have a two-component\nfluid: DM plus DE, one should look for models where\nthe dimensionless energy density of the background (DM)\nand of the DE are simultaneously non vanishing during a (cosmologically) long period of time. Otherwise,\nwe are interested in ratio functions r(a) that approach\na constant value r0 \u223c 1 at late times. A precedent of\nthis idea but for a phenomenologically chosen interaction term can be found, for instance, in Ref.[16], where\na scalar field model of phantom energy has been explored (a self-interacting scalar field with negative kinetic energy term \u03c1ph = \u2212\u03c6\u03072 /2 + V (\u03c6)). In this case,\nas already noted, the interaction term is of the form\nQ = 3Hc2 (\u03c1ph + \u03c1m ) = 3c2 H\u03c1m (r + 1)/r. For this\nkind of interaction, stability of models with constant ratio r0 = \u03c1m /\u03c1ph (and constant EOS parameter) yields to\n\n\f4\nvery interesting results. In effect, it has been shown in\n[16] that, if r0 < 1 (phantom-dominated scaling solution),\nthe model is stable. The solution is unstable whenever\nr0 > 1 (matter-dominated scaling solution). One can\ntrace the evolution of the model that evolves from the\nunstable (matter-dominated) scaling solution to the stable (phantom-dominated) one. As a consequence, this\nkind of interaction indicates a phenomenological solution\nto the coincidence problem [16]. Actually, once the universe reaches the stable phantom-dominated state with\nconstant ratio \u03c1m /\u03c1ph = \u03a9m /\u03a9ph = r0 , it will live in\nthis state for a very long time. Then, it is not a coincidence to live in this long-living state where, since r0 \u223c 1,\n\u03c1m \u223c \u03c1ph .\nThe above stability study can be extended to situations where no specific model for the phantom energy is\nassumed (like in the case of interest in the present paper)\nand where a general interaction term Q is considered (in\nour case Q is given in Eqn.(5)), if one introduces the\nfollowing dimensionless quantities[11]:\n\n3\n\ny\n\n-1.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nx\n1.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n1\n\n1\n\ny\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n-0.2\n\n\u03c1K\n\u03c1V\nx\u2261\n,; y \u2261\n,\n2\n3H\n3H 2\n\nk\n,\na2 H 2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\nx\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the \"kinetic\" \u03c1K \u2261 (\u03c1ph + pph )/2 and \"potential\"\n\u03c1V \u2261 (\u03c1ph \u2212 pph )/2 terms have been considered. Besides,\nif one where to consider FRW universe with spatial curvature k, an additional variable:\n\nz\u2261\u2212\n\n0\n\n(19)\n\nis needed.

The point (\u22123/2, 5/2) is an attractor. In\nthe lower part of the figure r0 > \u03be 2 (r0 = 1, \u03be 2 = 1/3).\nAll trajectories in phase space diverge from an unstable node\n(third critical point (x, y) = (\u22121/12, 7/12)). The first critical\npoint is a saddle. In any case the model has a late time phantom dominated attractor solution (the second critical point\n(x, y) = (\u22121/6, 7/6)).\n\nx\u2032 = \u2212(1 +\n\ntogether with the constrain \u03a9m = 1 \u2212 x \u2212 y \u2212 z, where\nthe comma denotes derivative with respect to the variable\nN \u2261 ln a. The parameter range is restricted to be 0 \u2264\nx + y + z \u2264 1. In the remaining part of this section, for\nsimplicity, we assume that \u03c9m = 0, i. e., the background\nfluid is dust.[34]\n\n[34] The details of the stability study will be given in a separate\npublication, where other kinds of interaction are considered also.\n\n1.\n\nFlat FRW (k = 0)\n\nLet us consider first the spatially flat case k = 0 \u21d2\nz = 0. Consider, besides, a constant ratio r = r0 and a\nconstant EOS parameter \u03c9ph = \u03c9ph,0 = \u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) < \u22121.\nAccording to (16), one obtains a coupling function of the\n2\nform: \u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (r0 /(r0 + 1)) a3(1+\u03be )/(r0 +1) . If one\nsubstitutes this expression for the coupling function into\nEqn. (5), then:\nQ=\n\n3(1 + \u03be 2 )\nH\u03c1m .\nr0 + 1\n\n(21)\n\nThe fixed points of the system (20) can be found once\nthe interaction function Q given in Eqn.(21) and the expression dpph /d\u03c1ph = \u03c9ph,0 = \u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) are substituted\ninto (20). The fixed points of the system (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = (0, 0)\nare: 1) (x, y) = (0, 1), 2) (x, y) = (\u2212\u03be 2 /2, 1 + \u03be 2 /2) and\n3) (x, y) = (\u2212\u03be 2 /[2(r0 +1)], (2+\u03be 2)/[2(r0 +1)]). Of these,\nthe first point is a saddle if r0 > \u03be 2 and an unstable node\nif r0 < \u03be 2 . The second critical point is always a stable\nnode. In this case \u03a9ph = x + y = 1 so, there is phantom\n\n\f5\n(dark energy) dominance. The third point is an unstable\nnode whenever r0 > \u03be 2 and a saddle otherwise. In this\ncase \u03a9ph = 1/(r0 +1) and \u03a9m = r0 /(r0 +1) are simultaneously non vanishing so, it corresponds to matter-scaling\nsolution. In Fig. 1 the convergence of different initial\nconditions to the attractor (phantom dominated) solution is shown in the phase space (x, y) (flat space case)\nfor given values of the parameters r0 and \u03be 2 . If r0 > \u03be 2\nall trajectories in phase space diverge from an unstable\nnode (third critical point). The first critical point is a\nsaddle. In any case the model has a late-time phantom\ndominated attractor solution (the second critical point).\n\n2.\n\nFRW with spatial curvature (k 6= 0)\n\nThe critical points (x\u2032 = 0, y \u2032 = 0, z \u2032 = 0) are:\n1) (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0) (de Sitter space), 2) (x, y, z) =\n(\u2212\u03be 2 /2, 1 + \u03be 2 /2, 0), 3) (x, y, z) = (\u2212\u03be 2 /[2(r0 + 1)], (2 +\n\u03be 2 )/[2(r0 +1)], 0) and 4) (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 1) (Milne space).\nThe first point is always a saddle, meanwhile, the second\ncritical point is always a stable node (a sink). The third\ncritical point is a saddle whenever r0 < \u03be 2 and an unstable node (a source) otherwise. This point corresponds\nto matter-scaling solution where both \u03a9m and \u03a9ph are\nsimultaneously non negligible. The fourth critical point\n(Milne space) corresponds to curved (k 6= 0) vacuum\nspace (\u03a9m = \u03a9ph = 0). This point is an unstable node if\nr0 < 2 + 3\u03be 2 and a saddle whenever r0 > 2 + 3\u03be 2 . Note\nthat, even if the evolution of the universe begins with\ninitial conditions close to the fourth critical pint (curved\nflat space), the model drives the subsequent evolution of\nthe universe to the stable node corresponding to a flat\nuniverse dominated by the phantom component.\nIn summary, the way to evade the coincidence problem when an interaction term of the general form (5) is\nconsidered, is then clear: One should look for models\nwhere, whenever expansion proceeds, both \u03c9ph and the\nratio r = \u03c1m /\u03c1ph = (1/\u03a9ph ) \u2212 1, approach constant values \u03c9ph,0 and r0 \u223c 1, respectively. Then, if trajectories in\nphase space move close to the third critical point (matterscaling solution), these trajectories will stay close to this\npoint for an extended (arbitrarily long) period of time,\nbefore subsequently evolving into the phantom dominated solution (second critical point) that is a late-time\nattractor of the model.[35]\n\nB.\n\nHow to avoid the big rip?\n\nIf we assume expansion (the scale factor grows up)\nthen, to avoid the future big rip singularity, it is necessary that the background fluid energy density \u03c1m and\nthe phantom pressure pph and energy density \u03c1ph , were\n\n[35] This argument is due to Alan Coley (private communication).\n\nbounded into the future. Once the \"ratio function\"\nr (Eqn.(1)) and the parametric EOS for the phantom\nfluid (pph = \u03c9ph \u03c1ph ) are considered, the above requirement is translated into the requirement that \u03c1ph , \u03c9ph \u03c1ph\nand r\u03c1ph were bounded into the future. Let us consider, for illustration, the case with constant EOS: \u03c9ph =\n\u03c9ph,0 = \u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) < \u22121, and the following ratio function:\nr = r0 a\u2212k ; \u03be 2 , k \u2208 R+ [17]. Integrating in the exponent\nin Eqn.(16) one obtains the following expression for the\ncoupling function:\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 r0 (ak + r0 )\u22121+3(1+\u03be\n\n2\n\n)/k\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nThe expression for the DM and phantom energy densities\nare then given through equations (see equations (8) and\n(1)):\n\u03c1m = \u03c1\u0304m,0 a\u22123 (ak + r0 )\u22121+3(1+\u03be\n\n2\n\n)/k\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nand\n\u03c1ph = \u03c1\u0304ph,0 a\u22123+k (ak + r0 )\u22121+3(1+\u03be\n\n2\n\n)/k\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0304m,0 = \u03c1m,0 \u03c7\u03040 r0 and \u03c1\u0304ph,0 = \u03c1m,0 \u03c7\u03040 . We see\n2\n2\n1/k\nthat, for a \u226b r0 , \u03c1m \u221d a\u2212k+3\u03be , while \u03c1ph \u221d a3\u03be .\n2\nFor \u03be < k/3 the DM energy density \u03c1m decreases with\nthe expansion of the universe. However, the phantom\nenergy density always increases with the expansion and,\nconsequently, the big rip singularity is unavoidable in this\nexample. The conclusion is that, for a phantom fluid\nwith a constant EOS \u03c9ph = \u03c9ph,0 and a power-law ratio\nof phantom to background (dust) fluid energy densities\n\u03c1m /\u03c1ph \u221d a\u2212k , the big rip singularity is unavoidable.\nFor a constant ratio r = r0 and a constant EOS (\u03c9ph =\n\u03c9ph,0 = \u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) < \u22121) [16], direct integration in Eqn.\n(16) yields to the following coupling function:\n\u03c7\u0304(a) = \u03c7\u03040 (\n\n3(1+\u03be 2 )\nr0\n) a r0 +1 ,\nr0 + 1\n\n(25)\n\nso, the background and phantom energy densities in Eqn.\n(8) are given by:\n\u03c1ph = r0\u22121 \u03c1m =\n\n2\n\u03c1\u0304m,0 \u22123( rr0 \u2212\u03be\n)\n0 +1 ,\na\nr0\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0304m,0 = \u03c1m,0 \u03c7\u03040 [r0 /(r0 +1)]. We see that, whenever\nthere is expansion of the universe, for r0 \u2265 \u03be 2 , there is\nno big rip in the future of the cosmic evolution, since\n2\n\u03c1ph \u221d r0 \u03c1ph \u221d \u03c9ph,0 \u03c1ph \u221d a\u22123(r0 \u2212\u03be )/(r0 +1) are bounded\ninto the future. In order to get accelerated expansion,\none should have r0 < 2 + 3\u03be 2 so, the ratio of background\n(dust) energy density to phantom energy density should\nbe in the range \u03be 2 \u2264 r0 < 2 + 3\u03be 2 .\nIV.\n\nMODELS THAT ARE FREE OF THE\nCOINCIDENCE PROBLEM\n\nIn the present section we look for a model with an\nappropriated coupling function \u03c7\u0304 that makes possible to\n\n\f6\ndensity parameters , r\n\n1\n\nequation (27), when substituted in Eqn.

The\nratio function r approaches a constant value at negative redshift r0 = 0.23. At present (z = 0) r = 0.25, which means\nthat we are already in the long living matter-scaling state.\nThe background energy density dominates the early stages of\nthe cosmic evolution. At z \u223c 0.33 both density parameters\nequate and, since then, the phantom component dominates\nthe dynamics of the expansion.

We study separately the\ncases with a constant EOS parameter \u03c9ph = \u03c9ph,0 =\n\u2212(1 + \u03be 2 ) < \u22121; \u03be 2 \u2208 R+ and with variable EOS parameter.\n\nA.\n\nm\n(1 \u2212 m\nB )a + C\n.\n(am + C)1\u22123(\u03c9m \u2212\u03c9ph,0 )/B\n\nConstant EOS parameter \u03c9ph = \u03c9ph,0\n\nIn order to have models where both \u03a9m and \u03a9ph are\nsimultaneously non-vanishing during a long interval of\ncosmological time (no coincidence issue) and that, at the\nsame time, are consistent with observational evidence on\na matter dominated period with decelerated expansion,\nlasting until recently (redshift z \u223c 0.39 [2]), we choose the\nfollowing dimensionless density parameter for the phantom component:\n\u03a9ph =\n\nam\nm\n( m\n),\nB a +C\n\n(27)\n\nwhere m, B, and C are arbitrary constant parameters.\nThis kind of density parameter function can be arranged\nto fit the relevant observational data, by properly choosing the free parameters (m, B, C) (m controls the curvature of the curve \u03a9ph (z), meanwhile C controls the point\nat which \u03a9ph (zeq ) = \u03a9m (zeq )).

In effect,\nfor large a \u226b 1, the following magnitudes\n\u03c1ph \u221d r \u03c1ph \u221d \u03c9ph,0 \u03c1ph\n\u221d a\u22123(1\u2212m(\u03c9m \u2212\u03c9ph,0 )/B) ,\n\n(31)\n\nare bounded into the future. In particular, the phantom energy density is a decreasing function of the scale\nfactor. Note that the ratio function r = \u03a9m /\u03a9ph approaches the constant value (B/m) \u2212 1 so both \u03a9m and\n\u03a9ph are simultaneously non vanishing. As explained in\nthe former section, this means that the universe is in the\nthird critical point (matter-scaling solution) which is a\nsaddle for r0 < \u03be 2 . In consequence, the universe will\nevolve close to this critical point for a sufficiently long\nperiod of time and then, the model approaches a stable\ndark energy dominated regime (second critical point).\nIn Fig. 2 we show the behavior of the density parameters \u03a9m and \u03a9ph and of the ratio function r as functions\nof the redshift (for simplicity we have considered background dust: \u03c9m = 0). The following values of the free\nparameters: m = 12, \u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1, C = 0.02 have\nbeen chosen, so that it is a big rip free solution. Besides we set the DE density parameter at present epoch\n\u03a9ph (z = 0) = 0.8 so, the following relationship between the free constant parameters B, m and C should\nbe valid: B = 1.25[m/(1 + C)]. In consequence, for\nthe values of m and C given above: B/m = 1.22 so,\n\u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1 > \u22121.22, meaning that there is no big\nrip singularity in the future of the cosmic evolution in\nthis model (see the condition \u2212B/m \u2264 \u03c9ph,0 under Eqn.\n(30)). In Fig. 3, the plot of the deceleration parameter q vs redshift is shown for three different values of\nthe EOS parameter \u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1, \u22121.5 and \u22123 respectively. It is a nice result that the solution without big rip\n(thick solid curve) is preferred by the observational evidence, since, according to a model-independent analysis\nof SNIa data[25], the mean value of the present value of\nthe deceleration parameter is < q0 >\u2248 \u22120.76.\n\n\f3\n\n1\n0.5\n\nbackground density\n\ndeceleration parameter\n\n7\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n-2.5\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nredshift\n\n0.8\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nredshift\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nphantom density\n\n5\n\nFIG. 3: The deceleration parameter q is plotted as function\nof the redshift z for the Model A (constant EOS parameter), for three different values of \u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1, \u22121.5 and\n\u22123 (thick solid, thin solid and dashed curves respectively).\nNote that the transition from decelerated (positive q) into\naccelerated (negative q) expansion occurs at z \u2243 0.4 for the\nvalue \u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1. It is apparent that this is, precisely, the\nobservationally favored solution, since, according to a modelindependent analysis of SNIa data, q(z = 0) \u2248 \u22120.76[25]. In\nconsequence, solutions without big rip are preferred by observations.\n\nB.\n\nDynamical EOS parameter\n\nWe now consider a dynamical EOS parameter \u03c9ph =\n\u03c9ph (a). In this case we should give as input the functions\n\u03a9ph (a) and \u03c9ph (a). In consequence, one could integrate\nin the exponent in Eqn.(13) so that the dynamics of the\nmodel is completely specified. In order to assure avoiding of the coincidence problem, let us consider the same\nphantom energy density parameter as in the former subsection (Eqn. (27)), but rewritten in a simpler form:\n\u03a9ph (a) =\n\n\u03b1 am\n,\nam + \u03b2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere m, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non negative (constant) free parameters. To choose the function \u03c9ph (a) one should take into\naccount the following facts: i) at high redshift and until\nrecently (z \u2243 0.39 \u00b1 0.03 [2]) the expansion was decelerated (positive deceleration parameter q) and, since then,\nthe expansion accelerates (negative q), ii) for negative\nredshifts the EOS parameter approaches a constant value\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nredshift\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n2.5\nhubble partameter\n\nThe way the coincidence problem is avoided in this\nmodel is clear from Fig.2 also. The ratio between the\nenergy density parameters of the background and of the\nDE approaches a constant value r0 = 0.23 for negative\nredshift so, both \u03a9m and \u03a9ph are non negligible. As\nalready said, this is a critical point (third critical point\nin the stability study of section 3) and the universe can\nlive for a long time in this state. Moreover, since at\npresent (z = 0); r(z = 0) = 0.25, we can conclude that\nthe universe is already in this long living state.\n\n4\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n0.5\nredshift\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 4: The plot of the energy densities of DM \u03c1m (upper part\nof the figure), phantom component \u03c1ph (middle part) and of\nthe Hubble parameter H vs redshift, is shown for three values\nof the constant parameter \u03c9ph,0 : \u22121.1 (thick solid curve),\n\u22121.5 (thin solid curve) and \u22123 (dashed curve) for the model\nwith dynamical EOS parameter. It is apparent that, only in\nthe first case the model is big rip free. Note that, due to the\nvalues chosen for the free parameters, in particular m = 12,\nthe phantom energy density vanishes as one approaches the\ninitial big bang singularity. This is true whenever m > 3 (see\nEqn.

This means that, whenever \u2212(1 +\n\u03c9m )/\u03b1 \u2264 \u03c9ph,0 (< \u22121), these functions are bounded into\nthe future and, consequently, there is no big rip in the\nfuture of the cosmic evolution in the model under study.\nIn Fig.4 the plot of the energy densities of DM \u03c1m\n(upper part of the figure), phantom component \u03c1ph (middle part) and of the Hubble parameter H vs redshift, is\nshown for three values of the constant parameter \u03c9ph,0 :\n\u22121.1 (thick solid curve), \u22121.5 (thin solid curve) and \u22123\n(dashed curve). The following values of the free parameters: m = 12, \u03b2 = 0.03, and \u03b4 = 3 10\u22124 have been\nchosen. We assume \u03a9m (z = 0) = 0.3[26] so, the following relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b2 should take place:\n\u03b1 = 0.7(\u03b2 + 1). It is apparent that, only in the first\ncase (\u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.2) the model is big rip free. Actually, as already noted, the necessary requirement for absence of big rip is, for the chosen set of parameters,\n\nFIG. 6: In the upper and middle part of the figure the EOS\nparameter \u03c9ph and the deceleration parameter q are plotted\nas functions of the redshift z (Model B), for three values of\nthe constant parameter \u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.1, \u22121.5 and \u22123 (thick\nsolid, thin solid and dashed curves respectively). It is worth\nnoting that at high redshift \u03c9ph approaches a constant value\n\u03c9ph = 0. It is a minimum at z = 0.35. The dark energy\nbecame a phantom fluid only recently, at z \u223c 0.45. Note that\nthe transition from decelerated (positive q) into accelerated\n(negative q) expansion occurs at z \u2243 0.4 for the value \u03c9ph,0 =\n\u22121.1. This last (big rip free) solution, seems to be preferred by\nobservations since, according to Ref. [25], q(z = 0) \u2248 \u22120.76.\nIn the lower part of the figure the ratio function is plotted\nfor three values of the parameter m: 12 (thick solid curve),\n8 (thin solid curve) and 4 (dashed curve) respectively. In\nany case, at present, the universe is already in the state with\nconstant ratio r.\n\n\u03c9ph,0 \u2265 \u22121/\u03b1 = \u22121.387. It is noticeable that, since\nwe chose m = 12 > 3, the DE energy density diminishes as one goes back into the past (it is a maximum at\npresent). In all cases the interaction term is negative during a given period of time in the past (see Fig.5), meaning\nthat the DM transferred energy to the DE component.\n\n\f9\nAt higher redshift the evolution proceeds without interaction. Worth noting that only in the singularity free\ncase (\u03c9ph,0 = \u22121.2) the interaction term is bounded into\nthe future.\nA physical argument against doomsday event can be\nbased on the following analysis. At late time, the interaction term Q \u2243 \u22123\u03b1 \u03c9ph,0 \u03c1m H. This means that,\nonly in the case when the evolution proceeds without big\nrip (\u03c1m and H are bounded), the interaction between\nthe components of the cosmic fluid does not become unphysically large at finite time into the future. Besides,\nfor the big rip free case, as the expansion proceeds into\nthe future, the Hubble parameter approaches a negligible\nvalue, meaning that the ratio Q/\u03c1m is small.\nIn the model the transition from decelerated into accelerated expansion takes place at z \u2243 0.4 (see Fig. 6).\nAt late times the deceleration parameter approaches the\nconstant value q0 \u2248 \u22120.8. Therefore, as in the case with\nconstant EOS parameter (Model A), the observational\nevidence (as argued in Ref. [25], q(z = 0) \u2248 \u22120.76) seems\nto favor solutions without big rip singularity. It is interesting to note that, in this model, the dark energy component behaved like dust (\u03c9ph = 0) at early times (high z),\ni. e., it behaved like an \"ordinary\" fluid with attractive\ngravity and, just until very recently (z \u2243 0.45), it has not\nbecame a phantom fluid. At present, the universe is already in a state characterized by constant \u03c9ph,0 \u223c \u22121.2\nand r0 = 0.48, meaning that \u03a9m,0 = r0 /(r0 + 1) and\n\u03a9ph,0 = 1/(r0 + 1) are simultaneously non vanishing. As\nshown before, this is a critical point of the corresponding\ndynamical system so, probably, the universe will stay in\nthis state for a long time and, consequently, the coincidence problem does not arise.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have investigated models with additional (non gravitational) interaction between the phantom component and the background. This kind of interaction is justified if the interacting components are\nof unknown nature, as it is the case for the DM and\nthe DE, the dominant components in the cosmic fluid.\nFor the sake of simplicity, baryons, a non vanishing, but\nsmall component of the background, have not been considered in the present study, however, in a more complete\nstudy these should be included also. A comment should\nbe made in this regard: There are suggestive arguments\nshowing that observational bounds on the \"fifth\" force do\nnot necessarily imply decoupling of baryons from DE[21].\nUnlike the phenomenological approach followed in\nother cases to specify the interaction term (see references [16, 17]), we started with a general form of the\ninteraction that is inspired in ST theories of gravity (see\nEqn.(5)). We have considered no specific model for the\nphantom fluid. Within this context, cosmological evolutions without coincidence problem have been the target\nof this investigation. We have studied two different mod-\n\nels: Model A, where the DE EOS parameter is always a\nconstant (phantom DE) and Model B, where we considered a dynamical DE EOS parameter (the DE became a\nphantom just recently). In these models there is a wide\nrange in the parameter space where the cosmic evolution\nis free of the unwanted big rip singularity also.\nThe interaction between the different components of\nthe cosmic mixture, enables the cosmic evolution to proceed without big rip singularity. In effect, if the interaction term is chosen so that there is transfer of energy\nfrom the phantom component to the background, then it\nis possible to arrange the free parameters of the model\nto account for decreasing energy density of the phantom\nfluid (as well as of the background fluid). A physical argument against big rip can be based on the analysis of\nthe interaction term Q. In model B, for instance, at late\ntime the interaction term Q \u2243 \u22123\u03b1 \u03c9ph,0 \u03c1m H. This\nmeans that, only whenever \u03c1m and H are bounded (no\nbig rip), the interaction between the components of the\ncosmic fluid does not become unphysically large at finite\ntime into the future. Besides, for the big rip free case,\nas the expansion proceeds into the future, the Hubble\nparameter approaches a negligible value, meaning that\nthe ratio Q/\u03c1m is small. From the observational perspective it seems that the evolution without doomsday\nevent is preferred also. For this purpose we have considered model-independent analysis of SNIa data yielding\nto a mean value of the present value of the deceleration\nparameter < q0 >\u2248 \u22120.76[25].\nInteracting models of dark energy are also useful to\naccount for the coincidence problem. In the present\nstudy, it has been shown that, a solution with simultaneously non vanishing values \u03a9m,0 = r0 /(r0 + 1) and\n\u03a9ph,0 = 1/(r0 + 1) (r0 is the constant ratio of the DM to\nDE densities), is a critical point of the corresponding dynamical system (third critical point in section 3). Hence,\nif trajectories in phase space get close to this point, these\ntrajectories will stay there during a sufficiently long period of time. This means that, once the universe is driven\ninto the state with simultaneously non vanishing \u03a9m and\n\u03a9ph , it will live in this state for a (cosmologically) long\nperiod of time until it is finally attracted into the phantom dominated phase being a stable node of the models\n(second critical point in section 3). This is the way the\ncoincidence problem is solved in the present investigation. It seems that we live already in the matter-scaling\nregime (third critical point) and will live in it for long\ntime until, finally, the phantom dominates the destiny\nof the cosmic evolution. In any case the evolution of the\nuniverse will proceed without the risk of any catastrophic\n(doomsday) destiny.\nAn obvious limitation of the present study is that only\ntwo specific models (model A and model B) have been\nconsidered. However, we think this suffices to illustrate\nhow interacting models can be constructed that avoid\nthe coincidence problem and , at the same time, fit some\nof the observational evidence. The outcome that big rip\nfree models are preferred by some of these observations\n\n\f10\nis just a nice result.\nWe are very grateful to Alan Coley and Sigbjorn\nHervik for valuable conversations that helped us to improve the original version of the manuscript.
