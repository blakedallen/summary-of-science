Regarding transport properties, magnetic ordering and spin fluctuations as well as the presumable unconventional SC iron\npnictides (IPs) are quite close to SC cuprates. In the latter\nclass at least part of the anomalous behavior emerges from\nthe proximity to the Mott-Hubbard insulator3 and from strong\ncorrelations, i.e. strong electron-electron Coulomb repulsion.\nOn the other hand, in IP correlations seem to be less severe so\nthe common point might be pronounced low-frequency spin\nfluctuations and a strong coupling of charge carriers to such\ncollective modes.\nThe experimental evidence for the magnetic order and fluctuations comes most directly from elastic and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) showing the commensurate spin-densitywave (SDW), i.e. the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order in the parent compounds.4 Recent INS results also confirm\nstrong and anomalous AFM normal-state spin fluctuations5 as\nwell as the resonant magnetic mode6,7 analogous to the well\nknown phenomenon in SC cuprates. That spin fluctuations\ndo not obey normal FL behavior follows also from NMRrelaxation results.8,9\nThe IPs show generally large normal-state d.c. electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ). Its systematics has been first studied in\nthe family emerging from the parent (undoped) compound\nLnFeAsO (LFAO) with a variety of lantanides Ln=Ce - Dy\nwhere the electron doping has been achieved either by doping\nwith F, e.g., in LnFeAsO1\u2212x Fx (LFAO)10\u201312 or via the oxygen deficiency LnFeAsO1\u2212y .13 Generally \u03c1(T ) is very high\ncomparable to underdoped cuprates.14 The behavior changes\nfrom a SDW semimetal x, y < 0.05 over to the intermediate regime x, y \u223c 0.1 with a nearly linear law \u03c1 \u221d T ,\ninto the overdoped regime with more FL-like \u03c1 \u221d T 2 behavior for y > 0.2. It is not yet evident to what extent\nvery large \u03c1(T ) are due to polycrystalline character or measured samples since only recently single-crystal data become\navailable.15 On the other hand, similar behavior appears in re-\n\ncently studied single-crystal class of electron-doped (so called\n122) family AE(Fe1\u2212x T Mx )2 As2 where various alkali elements AE=Ba, Sr, and Ca and transition metals (T M =Co,Cu)\nare at present explored. In the following we will mostly concentrate on the Ba(Fe1\u2212x Cox )x As2 (BaFeCoAs) compound\nmost investigated so far where x represents an effective electron doping. In this system the qualitative behavior of \u03c1(T ) is\nsimilar to LFAO results although the values are substantially\nsmaller.16,17 At the same time, the thermopower S(T ) is far\nfrom FL behavior S \u221d T , both in the LFAO (Refs. 10 and\n11) and in BaFeCoAs.18 The values become comparable to\nnondegenerate electrons, i.e., |S| \u223c s0 = kB /e0 = 86 \u03bcV/K\nwith the maximum typically at T \u223c 100 K, again resembling\nunderdoped cuprates.19 A similar message is emerging from\nstrongly T -dependent Hall constant RH (T ) in LFAO (Ref.\n20) and in BaFeCoAs.16,17\nOur aim is to extend the phenomenological analysis based\non the simplified two-band model coupled via spin fluctuations as introduced previously21 and apply it for a semiquantitative description of the transport properties of the\nelectron-doped IPs, here focusing on the BaFeCoAs compound. Starting with the evaluation of the anomalous T dependence of the quasiparticle (QP) damping rates, in particular in the electron band \u0393e (\u03c9), we analyze within the\nsame framework the d.c. transport quantities \u03c1(T ), S(T ), and\nRH (T ). To explain anomalous \u03c1(T ) it is essential to assume\nquite strong coupling to non-FL-type spin fluctuations. On the\nother hand large S(T ) can emerge only via a very asymmetric\n\u0393e (\u03c9) and due to the semimetal character (low effective Fermi\nenergies) of both bands. The previous approach21 is here upgraded with an explicit evaluation of T -dependent \u0393e (\u03c9) and\ncorresponding d.c. transport quantities without further simplifications. Qualitatively one can follow the development from a\nnon-FL behavior to a more normal FL-type regime by changing the carrier concentration and the character of the input\nspin fluctuations by introducing a crossover temperature T \u2217\ncontrolling the extent of non-FL vs. normal FL behavior thus\nsimulating the experimental findings in BaFeCoAs as well as\nin the LFAO system.\nIn Sec. II we describe the phenomenological model as introduced previously21 and give some justification based on a\n\n\f2\nmore complete microscopic model. Section III presents the\nlowest order approximation for the QP damping \u0393(\u03c9) being the central ingredient for the understanding of the transport properties where its temperature and energy dependence\nare essentially controlled by the (phenomenological) ansatz\nfor the spin-fluctuations mediated interband coupling as noted\nabove. In Sec. IV basic equations for the d.c. transport quantities are presented. Results in different regimes of relevant\nparameters follow in Sec. V with a discussion of the approach\nand results in Sec. VI.\n\nsponding Green's functions for \u03c3 = e, h h\u03c3\u0304 = (h, e)i electrons G\u03c3k (\u03c9) = [\u03c9 + \u2212 \u01eb\u03c3k \u2212 \u03a3\u03c3k (\u03c9)]\u22121 , where \u01eb\u03c3k = \u03b6k\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc.\nThe self-energies \u03a3\u03c3k (\u03c9) are evaluated within the lowest-order\nperturbation in the interband coupling, Eq.(1), induced by spin\nfluctuations entering via dynamical spin susceptibility \u03c7q (\u03c9),\n\nII. TWO-BAND MODEL\n\nTo proceed we make several simplifications, which are expected to apply to IPs in the low-doping regime close to the\nAFM (in the folded zone) instability, i.e., in the system without long-range AFM order. The spin fluctuations \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) in the\nnormal phase are assumed to be centered at q \u223c Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nand broad enough in the q space relative to h/e pockets. This\nis indeed well visible in recent INS results for the BaFeCoAs\nsystem.5 Hence we replace \u03c7q (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c7Q (\u03c9) = \u03c7\u0303(\u03c9). Since\nthe relevant e/h bands form only small pocket-like FS we neglect in the low \u03c9 regime also the k dependences of the selfenergies; i.e., we replace \u03a3\u03c3k (\u03c9) \u223c \u03a3\u03c3 (\u03c9) whereby k \u223c 0\nand k \u223c Q are relevant for the h- and e-bands, respectively.\nHence, with the local character of the self energies the spectral\nfunction A\u03c3k (\u03c9) = A\u03c3 (\u01ebk , \u03c9) can be expressed as\n\nFor the present analysis we adopt a simplified 2D model\nfor IP (Ref. 21) taking into account only two bands, an electron (e) band and a hole (h) band, both crossing the Fermi\nsurface22\u201324 and coupled via spin fluctuations.21 In the folded\nBrillouin zone22,25 the h-like and e-like pockets are at k \u223c 0,\nand k \u223c Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0), respectively,\nX\n\u0001\nHef = \u2212\n\u03b6ke c\u2020ks cks + \u03b6kh d\u2020ks dks\nk,s\n\n1 X\n+ \u221a\nmkq Sq * \u03c3ss\u2032 c\u2020k\u2212q,s dks\u2032 + H.c.), (1)\nN kq,ss\u2032\nand ck , dk , (\u03b6 e , \u03b6 h ) refer to electrons in e-like and h-like\nbands, respectively.\nThe following justification can be given for the above phenomenological model. The realistic electronic model for 2D\nIPs includes several (e.g., five) bands, emerging from d orbitals of Fe. The interaction term is very complicated in general. Still the low-energy description (in the case of weak\nor modest electron-electron interactions) should contain only\nboth bands at the Fermi surface (FS). So one of the relevant\ninteraction terms generating the interband coupling in Eq.(1)\ncan be written as26\nX \u2020 \u2020\nH\u0303 =\n\u0168 cks dk\u2032 s\u2032 dk\u2032\u2032 s\u2032 ck\u2032\u2032\u2032 s .\n(2)\n\nThe origin of the above interaction resides within a more complete multi-orbital model, the inter-orbital and intra-orbital\nHubbard interactions U and V , respectively, as well as in the\nHund's coupling JH . The effective interaction, Eq.(2), could\nbe rewritten as the coupling to a fluctuating SDW field\nX\nSq = \u0168\n(3)\n\u03c3ss\u2032 c\u2020ks dk+qs\u2032 .\nkss\u2032\n\nThe SDW fluctuation Sq should have in general, e.g., for the\nrelevant q \u223c Q a finite projection on the usual spin operator Sq (emerging from local moments), but this remains to\nbe shown by an explicit consideration within the full multiorbital model for IPs.\nIII.

Note that Z \u03c3 (\u03c9) and \u0393\u03c3 (\u03c9) play the role of the\nQP weight and the QP damping, respectively.\nThe above approximations simplify the expression for the\nQP damping as it follows from Eq.(4),21\nZ\n3\n\u0393\u03c3 (\u03c9) = m\u03042 d\u03c9 \u2032 g(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 )N \u03c3\u0304 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )\u03c7\u0303\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9 \u2032 ), (6)\n2\nwhere the effective interband\nP coupling is m\u0304 \u223c mQ,Q = m0,Q\nand N \u03c3 (\u03c9) = (2/N ) A\u03c3k (\u03c9) are the e/h band singleparticle densities of states (DOS).\nWithin the present analysis spin fluctuations are taken as a\nphenomenological input. In analogy with the anomalous QP\nand transport properties of cuprates3 we assume that the origin\nis in the non-FL character of \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) and a strong coupling of\ncarriers to the latter. Indeed, recent INS results in electrondoped BaFeCoAs indicate a behavior very close to the one for\nmarginal FL.5 For generality we therefore assume further-on\nthe form\n\u03c7\u0303\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03c0C(\u03c9)th\n\n\u03c9\n,\n2(T + T \u2217 )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere C(\u03c9) is (for T \u2217 = 0) the (symmetrized) dynamical\nspin correlation function.

Hence, we assume in the following calculations the simplified form for the unperturbed e/h bands,\ni.e. with 2D parabolic dispersions,\n\u01ebek = \u01ebe0 + te k 2 ,\n\n\u01ebhk = \u01ebh0 \u2212 th k 2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nThe above equations fully determine the evaluation procedure for \u03a3\u03c3 (\u03c9) at any T and consequently of transport quantities \u03c10 (T ), S(T ), RH (T ). The main input parameters are the\ne/h concentrations xe , xh and the corresponding t\u03c3 . We note\nthat coupling to spin fluctuations has a meaningful dimensionless coupling constant\nq\ng0 = m\u03042 C0 N0h N0e .\n(19)\nIn addition, results depend also on the FL temperature T \u2217 in\nEq.(7) and on the cutoff \u03c9 \u2217 , the latter mainly influencing low\u03c9 behavior through the QP weight Z(\u03c9).\nIn the following we consider the electron doped case xe >\nxh , as relevant, e.g. for the electron-doped BaFeCoAs. Obviously, here the transport properties are dominated by the transport within the e-type band, although at high T also hole pockets contribute partially. On the other hand, we realize that in\nsuch a case the treatment of minority (h) carriers is oversimplified, since even at modest g0 < 1 the hole QPs become heavily renormalized Z h (\u03c9) \u226a 1 influencing also N h (\u03c9). The\nlatter could be an artifact of the lowest order approximation\nfor the QP damping, Eq.(6). To avoid rather unphysical properties of hole QP, we introduce for the latter a simplification\n\u0393h (\u03c9) = \u0393ho . Note that \u0393h influences results only indirectly,\ni.e. entering the dominant e-band damping \u0393e (\u03c9) via N h (\u03c9).\nAt the same time, the hole contribution to d.c. transport quantities remains subleading provided that \u0393h0 > \u0393e (\u03c9 \u223c 0), in\nparticular at low T .\nOur aim is to show that the presented phenomenological\ntheory can consistently as well as semi-quantitatively account\n\n\f4\n\nT=50 K\n150 K\n300 K\n500 K\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 [eV]\n\n0.1\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393 e [eV]\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Electron-band QP damping \u0393e (\u03c9) for various T for the intermediate doping. Horizontal line represents the\nchosen hole damping \u0393h0 .\n\nLet us start with the case, representing presumably the\nanomalous intermediate doping. For actual results presented\nin Figs. 1 and 2 we choose fixed concentrations xe =\n0.2, xh = 0.08 while the remaining parameters are: g0 = 1.6,\nT \u2217 = 0, and \u0393h0 = 0.07 eV. In Fig. 1 we first present\nthe variation of \u0393e (\u03c9) around \u03c9 \u223c 0 for various T . Since\nT \u2217 = 0 the general behavior is of the MFL-type, i.e. roughly\n\u0393e \u221d max(|\u03c9|, T ).21 But as well important is a pronounced\nasymmetry with respect to \u03c9 = 0 which emerges from low\nxh \u226a 1 and from the strong scattering on \u03c9-dependent N h .\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u2192\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n250\n\n-S/S0\n\n\u2190\n\u03c1/\u03c10\n\nfor the anomalous non-FL normal-state transport properties of\n(electron-doped) IPs, in particular for the large and T -linear\n\u03c1(T ), large thermopower S(T ) reaching quasiclassical values\n|S| \u223c s0 , and T -dependent RH (T ). Evidently, in the absence\nof a better understood microscopic model and relevant input\nparameters as the effective spin fluctuations, all varying between materials and different doping levels, we here mainly\nconsider various possibilities and regimes which emerge from\nour analysis.\nWhile displaying different regimes we fix some parameters.\nIn the following we choose (unrenormalized) band parameters te = 0.4 eV and th = 0.3 eV and spin-fluctuation cutoff\n\u03c9 \u2217 = 0.5 eV. Actual levels of carrier concentrations xe , xh are\nnot directly known in particular materials, since the doping x,\ne.g., with Co in BaFeT M As, generally gives only partial information on x = xe \u2212 xh . To explain the anomalous properties it is, however, essential that xh is low leading to a very\nasymmetric damping \u0393e (\u03c9) and consequently to large values\nof S(T ). On the other hand, a disappearance of xh \u2192 0 reduces strongly the scattering within the e-band and the transport is expected to become more FL-like.\nEvidently, the crucial parameter is the coupling strength g0 .\nIt most directly influences the resistivity \u03c1(T ), and in particular its derivative d\u03c1(T )/dT . To account quantitatively for\nT \u223c 300 K experimental results for BaFeCoAs, we require\nmodest g0 \u223c O(1) as discussed further on. On the other hand,\nmuch larger resistivities within the LFAO family indicate substantially larger g0 \u226b 1, as analyzed previously.21 It should\nbe noted that due to constant \u0393h0 and xh iterations of Eq. (4)\nare not needed but still \u03bc should for each T separately be determined to keep xe fixed.\n\n0\n500\n\nT [K]\nFigure 2: (Color online) The resistivity \u03c1(T )/\u03c10 (ful line, left scale)\nand the thermopower S(T )/S0 (dashed line, right scale) for the intermediate electron-doped IP.\n\nThe corresponding \u03c1(T )/\u03c10 and S(T )/S0 are presented in\nFig. 2. Note that within a 2D layer \u03c10 = ~/e20 = 41.5 k\u03a9.\nFor actual BaFeCoAs materials with the interlayer distance\nc0 \u223c 1.3 nm this corresponds to \u03c1\u03030 = c0 \u03c10 \u223c 0.5 m\u03a9cm.\nAs a consequence of the MFL-type \u0393e (\u03c9) also \u03c1(T ) displays\na linear variation for lower T < 300 K with a tendency to a\nsaturation at higher T . Even more anomalous is S(T ) reaching a minimum at low T \u223c 150 K with anomalously large (for\na metal) value S \u223c \u22120.5s0 . The decrease in |S| at higher T\nresults mainly from the compensation effect between e-band\nand h-band contributions.\nThe effect of a nonzero FL temperature T \u2217 in Eq.(7), is\npresented in Fig. 3. At T \u2217 = 0 the MFL-type variation is\nevident in the linear resistivity \u03c1 \u221d T in Fig 3a. Finite T \u2217 > 0\ninduces more normal FL-type variation \u03c1 \u221d T 2 for T < T \u2217 .\nAt the same time also the S(T ) changes gradually from an\nanomalously large and non-monotonous variation at T \u2217 = 0\ninto more normal FL-type S \u221d T for large T \u2217 = 1000 K. The\n0\n0\nHall constant rH (T ) = RH (T )/RH\n(where RH\n= V0 /e2 , V0\nbeing the volume of the unit cell) is less sensitive on the nonFL behavior. Still it shows pronounced T variation for T \u2217 = 0\nemerging from a nontrivial electron/hole compensation and\nlinear \u03c1e (T ) \u221d T . Finally, at large T \u2217 one sees in Fig. 3c\nrather constant rH (T ) \u221d \u22121/xe as appropriate for a normal\nmetal.\nAs last, we discuss the variation with the electron doping\n\u03b4ne . We assume as the parent system the semimetal with finite x0e = x0h = 0.15. The effect of doping leads then to an\nincrease in xe where we take for simplicity xe = x0e + \u03b4ne /2\nand accordingly xh = xe \u2212 \u03b4ne . Since our treatment with a\nconstant \u0393h0 and without the possibility of an AFM ordering is\nnot adapted for an undoped system, we consider here only a\nlimited range \u03b4ne = 0.1 \u2212 0.2. The change in \u03c1(T ) in Fig. 4a\nis quite dramatic at \u03b4ne = 0.2. This is a direct consequence\nof nearly vanishing xh \u223c 0 where the interband scattering\nbecomes ineffective at low \u03c9. Such a situation in real IPs corresponds to the well overdoped case. Clearly, our simplified\nanalysis becomes insufficient beyond this point. Also S(T )\nshows a similar trend, since at highest doping it becomes entirely FL-like with S = \u03b1T with a modest \u03b1.\nFinally, let us turn to the comparison of our results with\n\n\f5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u03c1/\u03c10\n2\n\n\u03c1/\u03c10\n2\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nS/S0\n\n*\n\nT =0 K\n300 K\n500 K\n1000 K\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n-0.5\n\u03b4ne=0.1\n0.125\nS/S0\n0.15\n0.20\n\n-1\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n-10\n\n-10\n\nRH/RH0\n\n-20\n-30\n\n0\n\n250\n\n-20\n\n500\n\nT [K]\n\n-30\n\nRH/RH0\n0\n\n250\n\n(c)\n500\n\nT [K]\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) a) Resistivity \u03c1(T )/\u03c10 , b) thermopower\n0\nS(T )/S0 , and c) the Hall constant RH (T )/RH\nfor different Fermiliquid temperatures T \u2217 and fixed concentrations xe = 0.2, xh =\n0.08.\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) a) Resistivity \u03c1(T )/\u03c10 , b) thermopower\n0\nS(T )/S0 , and c) the Hall constant RH (T )/RH\nfor T \u2217 = 0 and various electron doping \u03b4ne with respect to the parent x0e = x0h = 0.15\ncase.\n\nthe experimental data on electron-doped IPs. Due to the phenomenological character of our theory as well as different IP\nmaterial classes with quite different properties only a semiquantitative comparison makes sense. Our central goal is to\nreproduce quite systematic variation of transport properties\nwith doping, from low electron doping over the intermediate\nregime (optimal doping with highest Tc ) to the overdoped one\nwhere SC disappears and IPs become rather normal FL-type\nmetals. In our approach the doping dependence enters primarily through the electron/hole concentration difference \u03b4ne .\nBut as well, it is plausible that also the spin-fluctuation spectra\n\u03c7\u0303\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) change, being strong and anomalous at low doping, and\non the other hand at intermediate doping weaker and more FLtype in the low-\u03c9 regime. Within our analysis we can partly\nsimulate the latter development with increasing T \u2217 .\n\nare reproduced within a factor of 3 \u2212 4. While the magnitude of \u03c1 is mostly governed by the spin-fermion coupling g0\nand can be fitted to experiments accordingly, it is essential\nthat our analysis also reproduces the anomalous variation of\nS(T ). Recent data on BaFeCoAs at x \u223c 0.15 reveal an abrupt\nincrease in electron-like thermopower with a maximum value\n|S| \u223c 0.6s0 at T = T0 \u223c 100 K.18 For T > T0 |S| is decreasing in value. Both these features as well as values are well\nreproduced in Fig. 2b.\nWith increasing Co-doping in BaFeCoAs, x > 0.1, the resistivity behavior becomes closer to \u03c1(T ) \u221d T 2 not so much\nreduced in value at T \u223c 300 K.16,17 In our analysis this corresponds to a change obtained by increasing the FL temperature\nT \u2217 > 0 with a simultaneous increase in \u03b4ne as presented in\nFigs. 3a and 4a. Even more pronounced change in character is\nin S(T ) (Ref. 18) since it reduces in value, loses the minimum\nand becomes FL-like, i.e., S = \u03b1T . Such a development is\nwell visible in Figs. 3b and 4b since both increasing T \u2217 > 0\nand \u03b4ne lead to a crossover to a normal FL with a moderate\nslope \u03b1.\nExperiments on the Hall constant reveal an electron-like\nRH < 0 with a pronounced T dependence17,18 which reduces\n\nIn the most challenging intermediate-doping regime our\ntransport results match reasonably recent experiments on\nsingle-crystals of the Co-doped BaFe2 As2 compound. Note\nthat BaFeCoAs with x = 0.1 at T = 300 K typically reveal \u03c1 \u223c 0.3 m\u03a9cm with a rather T -linear variation and corresponding slope d\u03c1/dT \u223c 0.5 \u03bc\u03a9cm/K.16\u201318 As shown in\nFig. 2a the value (note that \u03c1\u03030 = 0.5 m\u03a9cm) and the slope\n\n\f6\nin the overdoped regime where at the same time it becomes\n0\nconsistent with the quasiclassical picture RH /RH\n\u223c \u22121/xe .\n\u2217\nOur results in Figs. 3c and 4c show that both T > 0 as well\nas \u03b4ne > 0 lead to a constant FL-like RH . The particular\nvalue at T \u2192 0 from our analysis is less reliable. While at\n0\nweak coupling we recover the expected RH /RH\n\u223c \u22121/xe\n(for \u03c1e \u226a \u03c1h ) the value can deviate for larger coupling since\nthe approximations do not satisfy the Luttinger-volume sum\nrule. Note, however, that also the basic approximation Eq.(12)\nis not well understood yet.30,32\nQualitatively similar results for transport quantities have\nbeen previously obtained for polycrystalline samples of the\nelectron-doped LFAO family12 , discussed previously within\nthe same phenomenological framework.21 While our present\ndata with assumed parameters would quite well match the\nmeasured S(T ),10 reported \u03c1(T ) as well as the slope d\u03c1/dT\n(Ref. 12) are higher than in BaFeCoAs by a factor \u223c 5. It\nseems indicative that also recent single-crystal data15 do not\nreduce these values. From our present analysis this would require larger g0 \u226b 1 which could open the question of entering\nthe (too) strong coupling regime.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nIn conclusion, let us first put the present theoretical approach and its possible extensions in the perspective of related\ntheoretical approaches, in particular those treating the QP,\nmagnetic, and transport quantities in IPs. In contrast to many\nattempts to start with a more complete microscopic model,22\nour approach is restricted to the simplest prototype two-band\nmodel coupled via spin fluctuations. These are taken as a phenomenological input of the marginal FL type whose deviation\nfrom the normal FL behavior is controlled by the crossover\ntemperature T \u2217 . Our analysis clearly indicates that the coupling appears not to be weak [at least as deduced from observed \u03c1(T )] and that spin fluctuations are quite strong in\nthe low-\u03c9 regime as evidenced by INS experiments.5 It is\ntherefore expected that our analysis can go beyond the weakcoupling approximation, being the basis, e.g., for a randomphase-approximation-type treatment of many-orbital models.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\nY.

Jpn., 78, 043703 (2009).\n\nThe latter has been tested so far mostly on reproducing the\nproper band structure and on a qualitative description of relevant normal-state instabilities, in particular the most challenging SC onset. Evidently, our approach goes beyond the simple\nnesting scenario of the QP damping as well as of the SC pairing since in the latter wave vector (k, q) dependences would\nplay an essential role.\nInterpreting our results for anomalous transport properties\nof IPs, we argue that they emerge as the interplay of several\ningredients. First of all, observed \u03c1(T ) requires large interband coupling since the transport becomes quite normal and\nmodest when the electron doping depletes the hole band, i.e.\non approaching xh \u223c 0. The magnetic origin of the coupling\nis quite natural since it is intimately connected to the AFM\n(SDW) instability in the parent material and leads to an analogy with the physics of SC cuprates.\nHighly nontrivial S(T ) in our analysis can be mostly related to two effects: a) asymmetric variation of the QP damping \u0393e (\u03c9) being the consequence of asymmetric DOS N h (\u03c9)\ndue to the closeness of the top of the hole band, and b) small\n\u01eb0e which plays a role of the electron Fermi energy entering\ndirectly the expected FL behavior S \u223c \u03c0 2 T /3\u01eb0e .\nThere are still several open questions even within the presented framework. Generally, stronger interband coupling\nleads to strong damping of minority QP which requires the\ntreatment beyond the weak coupling. The same obstacle arises\nin the treatment of the parent and a weakly doped semimetal,\nwhere also experiments indicate very incoherent transport\nabove T > Tc . Also, a comparison with experimental results for particular compounds could lead to refined models to\nreach a closer quantitative agreement.\n\nVII.
