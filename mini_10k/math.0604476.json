We show that for a large class of knots and links with\ncomplements in S 3 admitting a hyperbolic structure, we can determine\nbounds on the volume of the link complement from combinatorial information given by a link diagram. Specifically, there is a universal\nconstant C such that if a knot or link admits a prime, twist reduced\ndiagram with at least 2 twist regions and at least C crossings per twist\nregion, then the link complement is hyperbolic with volume bounded\nbelow by 3.3515 times the number of twist regions in the diagram. C is\nat most 113.\n\n1. Introduction\nGiven a diagram of a knot or link, our goal is to determine geometric\ninformation about the complement of that link in S 3 . In particular, if the\ncomplement admits a hyperbolic structure, then by Mostow\u2013Prasad rigidity\nthat structure is unique. We ought to be able to make explicit statements\nabout the geometry of this link complement, including statements about its\nvolume. However, such results based purely on a diagram seem to be rare.\nGiven a particular diagram, there are examples of volume computations.\nFor example, Cao and Meyerhoff proved the smallest volume knot or link\ncomplement was the figure eight knot complement [4]. Given a simple diagram, computer software such as SnapPea, by Weeks, can often compute a\nhyperbolic structure, including the volume [16].\nFor particular classes of knots and links, other results on volume have\nbeen determined. Lackenby proved that in the special case in which a knot\nor link is alternating, then the volume of the complement is bounded above\nand below by the twist number of a diagram [10]. In fact, the upper bound\nis valid for all knots, not just alternating. This upper bound was further\nimproved by Agol and D. Thurston in an appendix to Lackenby's paper.\nAdditionally, they found a sequence of links with volume approaching the\nupper bound.\nRecently, the lower bound has been improved by results of Agol, Storm\nand Thurston [2]. The proof of this result still requires that the links in\nquestion be alternating, however.\nOur result is an extension of these results. We are able to prove that\na similar lower bound holds for a large class of knots and links, without\nthe requirement that these knots be alternating. We do, however, need to\nintroduce a requirement that the links be highly twisted in each twist region.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\nFigure 1. Twist regions of the diagram are encircled with\ndashed lines. For this diagram, tw(DK ) = 3.\nOur methods use explicit deformation of a hyperbolic structure through\ncone manifolds, using methods of Hodgson and Kerckhoff [8], [9]. The high\namount of twisting ensures that the explicit estimates in their papers and\nthis one will apply throughout the deformation.\nIn order to state our results, we review some definitions concerning the\ndiagram of a knot or link, following Lackenby [10].\nConsider the diagram of a knot or link as a 4\u2013valent graph in the plane,\nwhere associated to each vertex is over\u2013under crossing information. A bigon\nregion is a region of this graph bounded by only two edges.\nDefinition 1.1. A twist region of a diagram of a link K consists of maximal\ncollections of bigon regions arranged end to end. A single crossing adjacent\nto no bigons is also a twist region. Let DK denote the diagram of K. We\ndenote the number of twist regions in a diagram by tw(DK ). See Figure 1.\nOur statements concern the number of twist regions of a diagram of a\nknot or link. In order to rule out extraneous twist regions, we need the\ndiagram to be reduced in the sense of the following two definitions.\nFirst, we require the diagram to be prime. That is, any simple closed\ncurve which meets two edges of the diagram transversely must bound a\nregion of the diagram with no crossings.\nSecond, we require the diagram to be twist reduced. That is, if any simple\nclosed curve meets the diagram transversely in four edges, with two points of\nintersection adjacent to one crossing and the other two adjacent to another\ncrossing, then that simple closed curve must bound a region of the diagram\nconsisting of a (possibly empty) collection of bigons arranged end to end\nbetween the crossings.\nIf a diagram of a hyperbolic knot or link is not prime, them some crossings\nare extraneous and can be removed to obtain a prime diagram. If it is not\ntwist reduced, then a series of flypes will decrease the number of twist regions\nof the diagram, until we are left with a twist reduced diagram.\nWith these definitions, we are ready to state our results.\nTheorem 1.2. There is a universal constant C such that if K is a knot or\nlink admitting a prime, twist reduced diagram DK with at least 2 twist regions\nand at least C crossings in each twist region, then S 3 \u2212 K is hyperbolic with\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n3\n\nvolume bounded below:\nVolume(S 3 \u2212 K) \u2265 tw(DK )(3.3515).\n\nFurther, the universal constant C is at most 113.\n\nThe upper bound on volume given by Lackenby, and Agol and D. Thurston\nis also linear in the number of twist regions of the diagram [10]. Specifically,\nAgol and Thurston showed:\nVolume(S 3 \u2212 K) \u2264 10 v3 (tw(DK ) \u2212 1)\n\nwhere v3 (\u2248 1.01494) is the volume of a regular hyperbolic ideal tetrahedron.\nThus the results in this paper extend the class of knots and links for which\nvolume is bounded above and below by linear functions of tw(DK ).\nOur proof is geometric in nature. We begin with a link L whose complement is geometrically explicit. We show that S 3 \u2212 K can be obtained\nfrom S 3 \u2212 L by Dehn filling. We determine a lower bound on the volume of\nthe link complement S 3 \u2212 L. We then perform hyperbolic Dehn filling by\na cone deformation. Our final result is obtained by bounding the change in\ngeometry under this cone deformation.\nIn Section 2, we describe the link L and explain how to obtain S 3 \u2212\nK from S 3 \u2212 L by Dehn filling. In Section 3, we will review results on\ncone deformations and describe their application to our particular situation.\nFinally, in Section 4 we put these results together to conclude the proof of\nTheorem 1.2.\n2. Initial Geometric Estimates\n2.1. The augmented link L. Start with a prime, twist reduced diagram\nDK of a link K. In the rest of this paper, we will assume the diagram DK\nis fixed once and for all. To simplify notation, we will refer to this fixed\ndiagram and the knot by the same symbol K. Thus we will write tw(K)\nto mean tw(DK ). The reader should note that the twist number tw(DK )\nis dependent upon the particular choice of prime, twist reduced diagram.\nHowever, since our diagram is now fixed, this simplification should cause no\nconfusion.\nGiven our diagram of K, we obtain a new link by adding additional link\ncomponents to the diagram. At each twist region, encircle the twist region\nby a simple curve, called a crossing circle. See Figure 2 (a) and (b). Links\nwith added crossing circles have been studied by many people, including\nAdams [1]. These links were used by Lackenby, and also by Agol and D.\nThurston to improve Lackenby's volume results for alternating links [10].\nProvided the original diagram of K was prime and twist reduced with at\nleast two twist regions, then the link with crossing circles added is known\nto be hyperbolic. This can be shown either using methods of Adams [1], or\ndirectly using Andreev's theorem [12].\nLet J be the link with crossing circles added to each twist region of K.\nModify the diagram of J by removing pairs of crossings at each twist region,\n\n\f4\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2. (a) The original link diagram K. (b) Crossing\ncircles added. (c) The diagram of L.\nand let L be this new link. Now, S 3 \u2212J is homeomorphic, and thus isometric\nby Mostow\u2013Prasad rigidity, to the manifold S 3 \u2212 L. The diagram of L\nconsists of strands in the projection plane encircled in pairs by crossing\ncircles. These strands in the projection plane only cross, if at all, in pairs\nat crossing circles, and here they may only cross once. We will call such a\nlink an augmented link. See Figure 2 (c).\nThe augmented link L has a complement with nice geometric properties,\nallowing us to give estimates on the volume of S 3 \u2212 L. Before giving these\nestimates, we relate S 3 \u2212 L to the complement of the original link, S 3 \u2212 K.\n2.2. Dehn filling on S 3 \u2212 L. Let Ci be the i-th crossing circle of the link\nL. Take a horoball neighborhood Ni of the cusp corresponding to Ci in\nS 3 \u2212 L. Then Ni has torus boundary, with meridian \u03bc and longitude \u03bb. If\nwe glue a solid torus onto S 3 \u2212 L \u2212 Ni in such a way that the boundary\nof the solid torus is glued to the boundary \u2202Ni , with the curve \u03bc + ni \u03bb on\n\u2202Ni bounding a meridional disk of the solid torus, then we obtain a new\nlink complement in S 3 . The diagram of this link is the same as that of L,\nonly now ni full twists (i.e. 2ni crossings) have been inserted into the i-th\ntwist region, and the crossing circle Ci has been removed (see for example\n[14], Chapter 9). Recall that the insertion of a solid torus into the manifold\nS 3 \u2212 L in this manner is called the Dehn filling of S 3 \u2212 L along the slope\n1/ni on Ci .\nNow, since L was originally obtained from K by adding crossing circles\nand removing crossings at twist regions in a diagram, by choosing values\nfor the ni appropriately at each crossing circle, this type of Dehn filling\nperformed at each crossing circle will give us back the original link complement S 3 \u2212 K. Precisely, we perform Dehn filling of S 3 \u2212 L along the\nslopes (1/n1 , 1/n2 , . . . , 1/ntw(K) ) on crossing circle components to obtain\nthe manifold S 3 \u2212 K.\n2.3. Decomposition of S 3 \u2212 L. In their appendix to Lackenby's paper\n[10], Agol and D. Thurston describe how to decompose the link complement\nS 3 \u2212 L into totally geodesic ideal polyhedra when L happens to have no\ncrossings of strands in the projection planes (i.e., in our case, when K had an\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n5\n\nA\nA\n\nC\n\nC\n\nFigure 3. Decomposing S 3 \u2212 L into ideal polyhedra: First\nslice along the projection plane, then split remaining halves\nof two\u2013punctured disks. Obtain polyhedron on right.\neven number of crossings at each twist region). Their methods immediately\nextend to the case when single crossings of the strands in the projection\nplane are allowed at each twist region. In the following paragraphs, we\nreview the main results. See also [6] for more details and pictures.\nFirst, consider a link with no single crossings in the projection plane. Call\nthis link L\u0304. Notice that a reflection through the projection plane preserves\nL\u0304. Thus the projection plane is a totally geodesic surface in S 3 \u2212 L\u0304 (see for\nexample [11]). Now slice S 3 \u2212 L\u0304 along the projection plane. This breaks the\nmanifold into two pieces with totally geodesic boundary. Each 2\u2013punctured\ndisc bounded by a crossing circle has been sliced in half. Next slice each of\nthese halves and open them up into two triangles. Since triangles can be\ntaken to be totally geodesic, the result is two identical polyhedra, P1 and\nP2 , with totally geodesic faces.\nThe ideal polyhedra P1 and P2 have two kinds of faces. \"White faces\"\ncome from regions of the projection plane. The triangular \"shaded faces\"\nconsist of halves of the 2\u2013punctured discs bounded by crossing circles. These\ntwo types of faces intersect each other at right angles. The intersections are\nthe edges of the polyhedra. The edges meet in 4\u2013valent ideal vertices. At\nthese vertices, two white and two shaded faces lie across from each other in\npairs. See Figure 3.\nWe obtain the manifold S 3 \u2212 L\u0304 from these polyhedra by reversing the\nslicing procedure above. First, on each Pi , form the 2\u2013punctured disc halves\nby gluing back together the two shaded triangles which were opened along\ntheir common vertex. Then glue the white faces of P1 to the identical white\nfaces of P2 .\nBy changing the gluing procedure slightly, we can obtain the manifold\nS 3 \u2212 L from the polyhedra P1 and P2 as well. Recall the link L may have\nsingle crossings at some crossing circles. For each crossing circle Ci of L,\nconsider the four shaded triangles (two on P1 , and two on P2 ) making up\nthe disc bounded by the corresponding crossing circle of L\u0304. For example,\nthe shaded faces labelled with A in Figure 3 are two of the four triangles.\nThe other two lie on an identical polyhedron.\n\n\f6\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\nFigure 4. Left: Gluing 2\u2013punctured discs with no crossings.\nRight: Gluing 2\u2013punctured discs with a single crossing.\nIf there are no single crossings at the twist region of Ci , then the gluing is\nthe same as for S 3 \u2212 L\u0304: Glue the triangles of Pi , i = 1, 2, to each other across\ntheir common vertex. For example, in Figure 3, the faces labelled A would\nbe glued together. If there is a single crossing at Ci , glue each triangle of\nP1 to the opposite one of P2 , matching vertices from the crossing circle. For\nexample, if we replace the link on the left in Figure 3 with one with a single\ncrossing in the top twist region, then in the gluing of the two polyhedra the\ntop face labelled A in the figure on the right would be glued to the opposite\nface labelled A of the opposite polyhedron. This puts a \"half\u2013twist\" into\nthe manifold. See Figure 4 for another schematic picture. In either case,\nS 3 \u2212 L is then obtained by gluing corresponding white faces of P1 and P2\ntogether, as in the gluing of S 3 \u2212 L\u0304.\nNow, we wish to find lower bounds on volume. We will give a rough lower\nbound first by considering the cusp volume of S 3 \u2212 L.\n2.4. Volume estimate for S 3 \u2212 L. To give an estimate on the cusp volume of S 3 \u2212 L, we must analyze neighborhoods of the ideal vertices of the\npolyhedra. These neighborhoods were analyzed quite carefully with Futer\nin [6]. Again we record the results here.\nA horospherical torus about a cusp of the manifold S 3 \u2212 L will intersect\nthe polyhedra P1 and P2 in rectangles. This is because at a cusp, ideal\nvertices of P1 and P2 meet. These vertices are all 4\u2013valent, meaning their\nintersection with a horosphere is a quadrilateral, and all faces of the Pi meet\nat right angles, forcing the quadrilateral to be a rectangle. The sides of this\nrectangle can be colored according to the color of the faces of intersection.\nThus each rectangle will have two \"white sides\" across from each other, and\ntwo \"shaded sides\" across from each other. When we glue the polyhedra\ntogether to form S 3 \u2212 L, we glue these rectangles along white and shaded\nsides. Thus each cusp of S 3 \u2212 L is tiled by rectangles. The number and size\nof these rectangles will give us a volume estimate.\nThe following two lemmas are essentially Lemmas 2.3 and 2.6 of [6].\nLemma 2.1. A horospherical torus about a cusp in S 3 \u2212 L corresponding\nto a crossing circle is tiled by two rectangles. These rectangles are given by\nthe intersection of the horospherical torus with P1 and P2 .\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n7\n\n\u2022 A longitude of the crossing circle is isotopic to the curve given by\nstepping along two shaded sides of the rectangles.\n\u2022 A meridian is isotopic to the curve given by a white side of a rectangle plus \u01eb times a shaded side, where \u01eb = 0, \u00b11 depending on\nwhether the crossing circle bounded no crossings, or one crossing in\nthe positive or negative direction, respectively.\nLemma 2.2. A horospherical torus about a cusp in S 3 \u2212 L corresponding\nto a link component Li in the projection plane is tiled by 2 C(Li ) rectangles,\nwhere C(Li ) is the number of crossing circles, counted with multiplicity,\nthrough which Li passes in the diagram of L.\nWhen K is a knot with diagram DK , there is just one link component\nin the projection plane, and so it passes through each crossing circle twice.\nSince the number of crossing circles in the diagram of L is tw(K), in this\ncase the number of rectangles in the cusp of S 3 \u2212 L corresponding to the\nlink component in the projection plane is 4 tw(K).\nWhen K is a link, we still have two strands passing through each crossing circle. Thus the total number of rectangles in all the cusps of S 3 \u2212 L\ncorresponding to link components on the projection plane is still 4 tw(K).\nWe record these results in the following lemma.\nLemma 2.3. There are a total of 4 tw(K) rectangles tiling all horospherical tori about the cusps of S 3 \u2212 L corresponding to link components in the\nprojection plane.\nWe need the sizes of these rectangles. Again these results were previously\ncomputed. The following is essentially Corollary 3.9 of [6].\nLemma 2.4. There exists a choice of horospheres expanded about all cusps\nof S 3 \u2212 L so that given this expansion, the length of any shaded side of a\nrectangle is exactly one. The length of any white side of a rectangle is at\nleast one.\nThese lemmas immediately give the following proposition.\nProposition 2.5. Let K be a link with a prime, twist reduced diagram with\ntw(K) \u2265 2 twist regions. Then the augmented link L obtained by adding\na crossing circle to the diagram of K at each twist region has complement\nS 3 \u2212 L with cusp volume at least 3 tw(K).\nProof. We can compute the cusp volume by computing the volume of a\nregion in the universal cover H3 of S 3 \u2212 L which projects to the cusp in a\none\u2013to\u2013one manner.\nConsider the upper half space model of H3 . For any cusp, we can conjugate so that the point at infinity in this model of H3 projects to that\ncusp under the covering map. Then the rectangles tiling that cusp lift to\ngive rectangles tiling a horosphere about infinity. For each rectangle on the\ncusp, choose a representative on the horosphere projecting to that rectangle.\n\n\f8\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\nThen the volume of the cusp is given by the sum of the volumes of regions\nof H3 lying over these rectangles.\nBy Lemma 2.4, the volume over any of these rectangles is at least as large\nas the volume lying over the square with side length 1. A calculation shows\nthat the volume lying over a square of side length 1 is 1/2. So the volume is\nat least 1/2 times the total number of rectangles tiling all cusps of S 3 \u2212 L.\nTo determine the total number of rectangles tiling all cusps of S 3 \u2212 L, we\nuse the previous lemmas. By Lemma 2.3, there are 4 tw(K) rectangles tiling\nall cusps coming from link components in the projection plane. By Lemma\n2.1, there are 2 rectangles per crossing circle. But there are tw(K) total\ncrossing circles in the diagram of L. Hence there are 2 tw(K) rectangles\ntiling cusps coming from crossing circles. So the total number of rectangles\ntiling all cusps of S 3 \u2212 L is 6 tw(K).\nThus the total cusp volume is at least 6 tw(K)(1/2) = 3 tw(K).\n\u0003\nWe obtain a better estimate on volume by combining this cusp estimate\nwith B\u00f6r\u00f6czky's lower bound for the density of a horoball packing in hyperbolic space [3]. By his result, the volume of a \u221a\nmaximal cusp neighborhood in a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold M is at most 3/(2v0 ) \u2248 0.853276\ntimes the volume of the manifold M , where v0 is the volume of a regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron. Thus the volume of S 3 \u2212 L is at least\n(3 tw(K))/(0.853276) \u2248 3.51586 tw(K).\nCorollary 2.6. Let K be a link with a prime, twist reduced diagram with\ntw(K) \u2265 2 twist regions. Then the augmented link L obtained by adding\na crossing circle to the diagram of K at each twist region has complement\nS 3 \u2212 L with volume at least (3.51586) tw(K).\n3. Deformation Through Cone Manifolds\n3.1. Hyperbolic Dehn filling. In the previous section, we obtained a hyperbolic link whose geometry could be determined explicitly. This hyperbolic link was related to our original link by a Dehn filling, i.e., by gluing\nsolid tori into the cusps corresponding to crossing circles.\nThurston showed that most Dehn fillings on components of a hyperbolic\nlink complement can be obtained by a hyperbolic Dehn filling, that is, by\ndeforming the complete hyperbolic geometric structure on the cusped manifold through incomplete hyperbolic structures, yielding a new manifold with\na final complete hyperbolic structure [15]. Hodgson and Kerckhoff were able\nto make this explicit in [9]. They showed that if the normalized lengths of\nthe slopes along which the hyperbolic Dehn filling is performed are each\nlonger than a universal constant, then hyperbolic Dehn filling is possible. In\nparticular, in this case of long slopes, a special type of deformation through\nincomplete hyperbolic structures exists, called a hyperbolic cone deformation. In a hyperbolic cone deformation, each of the intermediate incomplete\nstructures of the deformation is a hyperbolic cone manifold.\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n9\n\nFor a complete description of hyperbolic cone manifolds and the metrics\ninvolved, see [8]. For our purposes, a hyperbolic cone manifold M admits a\nsmooth hyperbolic metric everywhere except along a link \u03a3. At each link\ncomponent \u03a3i of \u03a3, a tubular neighborhood has meridional cross section\nwhich is a 2\u2013dimensional hyperbolic cone, with cone angle \u03b1i . The cone\nmanifold structure on M is locally parameterized by the collection of angles\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N ).\nIn our case, recall that we wish to perform Dehn filling on S 3 \u2212L to obtain\n3\nS \u2212 K. The fillings are performed along the slopes 1/ni on the crossing\ncircles. Thus our singular locus \u03a3 will consist of the cores of the crossing\ncircles. Provided our slopes are long enough to meet the requirements found\nin [9], we will obtain a cone deformation of the hyperbolic structure on\nS 3 \u2212 L with initial cone angles all 0. Each cone angle will increase strictly\nmonotonically to cone angle 2\u03c0 under the deformation.\nIn [9], Hodgson and Kerckhoff found bounds on the change of volume\nunder certain cone deformations, in particular those with a single component\nof the singular locus \u03a3. Since we are filling along multiple cusps, with\nmultiple components of \u03a3 (one per crossing circle), we will need versions of\nthe results in [9] which allow filling along more than one cusp. We state\nthose results here.\n3.2. Change of Volume. The following theorem is Theorem 6.5 of [9],\nmodified for the case of multiple components of the singular locus \u03a3. The\nnotation is from that paper. In particular,\n(1)\n\nH(z) =\n\nand\ne\nG(z)\n=\n\n(2)\n\n1 + z2\n,\n3.3957 z(1 \u2212 z 2 )\n(1 + z 2 )2\n.\n6.7914 z 3 (3 \u2212 z 2 )\n\nTheorem 3.1. Let X be a cusped hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold and M a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold which can be joined by a smooth family of hyperbolic cone\nmanifolds with cone angles 0 \u2264 \u03b1i \u2264 2\u03c0 along the i-th component \u03a3i of a\nlink \u03a3. Suppose that \u03b1i li \u2264 0.5098 holds throughout the deformation, where\nli denotes the length of \u03a3i . Then the difference in volume\nsatisfies\n\n\u2206V = Volume(X) \u2212 Volume(M )\n\u2206V \u2264\n\nXZ\ni\n\n1\n\u1e91i\n\nH \u2032 (w)\ne\n8H(w)(H(w) \u2212 G(w))\n\ndw.\n\nHere \u1e91i = tanh(\u03c1\u0302i ), \u03c1\u0302i is the unique solution of 1.69785 tanh(\u03c1\u0302i )/ cosh(2\u03c1\u0302i ) =\n2\u03c0 l\u0302i with \u03c1\u0302i \u2265 0.531, and l\u0302i is the length of \u03a3i in M .\nSince this version of the theorem is somewhat different from that in [9],\nwe outline its proof in the appendix, Section 5.\n\n\f10\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\n4. The Volume Estimate\nIn this section, we will find conditions under which Theorem 3.1 will apply.\nUsing these conditions, we can complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.\nFor Theorem 3.1 to apply, we first need a smooth cone deformation from\nthe manifold S 3 \u2212 L to the manifold S 3 \u2212 K. We also need each pair of cone\nangle \u03b1i and length of singular locus component li to satisfy the inequality\n\u03b1i li \u2264 0.5098.\nIn fact, the existence of the deformation and the bound on \u03b1i li are both\ngiven by Hodgson and Kerckhoff in Theorem 5.12 of [9]. (More accurately,\nthese are given in the proof of that theorem.) In our situation, this theorem\nstates that provided the slopes\np 1/ni along which we perform Dehn filling have\nnormalized length at least 2(56.4696) \u2248 10.628, then a cone deformation\nexists with initial point the complete hyperbolic structure on S 3 \u2212 L, and\nextends to give the complete hyperbolic structure on S 3 \u2212 K with each cone\nangle equal to 2\u03c0.\nNormalized length is defined as follows.\nDefinition 4.1. Let s be a slope on a cusp with cusp torus T . Let \u03b1 be a\ngeodesic representative of s on T . The normalized length of s is defined to\nbe the length of \u03b1 divided by the square root of the area of T :\nLength(\u03b1)\n.\nNormalized length(s) = p\nArea(T )\n\nAt the i-th crossing circle, recall we perform Dehn filling along the curve\n\u03c3i = \u03bc + ni \u03bb, where \u03bc is a meridian of a torus about this crossing circle, and\n\u03bb is a longitude. Thus we need\np to estimate the normalized length of this\ncurve, to ensure it is at least 2(56.4696).\nIn Section 2, Lemma 2.1, we saw that a torus about a crossing circle\nis tiled by two rectangles with white and shaded sides, and meridian and\nlongitude given by steps along those sides. The longitude \u03bb is given by two\nsteps along shaded sides. If the crossing circle bounds a single crossing, then\n\u03bc is given by one step along a white side, plus or minus a step along a shaded\nside, and \u03c3i is given by a step along a white side plus (or minus) 2ni +1 steps\nalong shaded sides. If the crossing circle bounds no single crossing, then \u03bc\nis given by one step along a white side, and \u03c3i is given by a step along a\nwhite side plus (or minus) 2ni steps along shaded sides. In either case, note\nthat if ci is the number of crossings in the i-th twist region, then the curve\nthe curve \u03c3i is given by one step along a white side plus (or minus) ci steps\nalong shaded sides.\nLet w denote the length of a white side and let s denote the length of a\nb i of\nshaded side. Since the area of the torus is 2sw, the normalized length L\n\u03c3i is given by:\nr\nc2 s\nw\nb\n+ i .\nLi =\n2s 2w\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n11\n\nThis will be a minimum when w/2s equals ci /2, and that minimum value is\n\u221a\nci . Hence we need ci large enough that\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nci \u2265 2(56.4696) = 112.9392\n\nThus ci \u2265 113 will be sufficient.\nThen Theorem 5.12 of [9] will apply to X = S 3 \u2212 L to give the desired\ncone deformation and bounds on the \u03b1i li . Hence Theorem 3.1 applies to\nX = S 3 \u2212 L and M = S 3 \u2212 K, and we find:\ntw(K) Z 1\nX\nH \u2032 (w)dw\nVolume(X) \u2212 Volume(M ) \u2264\ne\n\u1e91i 8H(w)(H(w) \u2212 G(w))\ni=1\n\nNote the sum is over all components of the singular locus. In our case, these\ncorrespond to the crossing circles, and there are exactly tw(K) of these.\nIn the i-th cusp, the value of z decreases from 1 to the value \u1e91i . Recall\nfrom the statement of Theorem 3.1 that \u1e91i = tanh(\u03c1\u0302i ), where \u03c1\u0302i is the\nunique solution of some equation such that \u03c1\u0302i \u2265 0.531. In particular, \u03c1\u0302i is\nguaranteed to be at least 0.531. So \u1e91i is at least z1 = tanh(0.531). Thus the\ndecrease in volume is at most:\ntw(K)\ntw(K) Z 1\nX\nX\nH \u2032 (w)dw\n\u2264\n0.16436 = tw(K)(0.16436)\ne\n8H(w)(H(w)\n\u2212\nG(w))\nz\n1\ni=1\ni=1\nHence\n\nVolume(M ) \u2265 Volume(X) \u2212 tw(K)(0.16436)\nAlso, we know by Corollary 2.6 that Volume(X) \u2265 (3.51586) tw(K).\nHence we obtain our final result:\nVolume(M ) \u2265 (3.51586) tw(K) \u2212 tw(K)(0.16436) = tw(K)(3.3515)\n\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1.2 which we restate.\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let K be a link in S 3 admitting a prime, twist reduced\ndiagram with tw(K) \u2265 2 twist regions and at least 113 crossings per twist\nregion. Then the volume of S 3 \u2212 K satisfies:\nVolume(S 3 \u2212 K) \u2265 tw(K)(3.3515)\n5. Appendix\nIn this appendix, we sketch the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nThe proof is identical to that in [9], except for small modifications that\nneed to be made for the case in which the cone manifold has multiple components of the singular locus.\nIn particular, the following changes to that proof need to be made. First,\nin [9], the cone deformation was parameterized by t = \u03b12 . When there are\nmultiple components, we can no longer guarantee that the deformation is\nparameterized by t = \u03b12j for each \u03b1j . We do know that some parameterization exists for which the calculations of [9] go through (see the comment at\n\n\f12\n\nJESSICA S. PURCELL\n\nthe bottom of page 41 in [9], and Purcell [13]), but we don't know specifically\nwhat that parameterization will be. Thus we need to modify the calculations\nto be independent of parameterization.\nWe also need to make modifications to calculations which used the area\nestimate for a single cusp, Theorem 4.4 of [9]. As stated in that theorem,\nthe lower bound for the area is half as large when the singular locus has\nmultiple components. Thus we replace Corollary 5.1 of [9] with half that\nestimate:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ntanh(R)\ntanh(R)\n1\n.\n3.3957\n= 1.6978\n(3)\n\u03b1i li \u2265\n2\ncosh(2R)\ncosh(2R)\nWe recompute calculations using this new estimate.\nWith these two modifications, the proof goes through nearly as written\nin [9]. Following their notation, we begin by letting ui = \u03b1i /li . Hodgson\nand Kerckhoff bounded the change in ui by finding bounds on dui /dt, in\nProposition 5.6. Rather than take derivatives with respect to time t, we\ntake derivatives with respect to cone angle \u03b1i in the i-th cusp. This is\nindependent of parameterization. The half of Proposition 5.6 of [9] necessary\nfor Theorem 3.1 becomes:\n1 dui\ne i)\n\u2264 4G(z\n(4)\n\u03b1i d\u03b1i\n\ne\nwhere the function G(z)\nis defined as in (2).\nNow we are ready to modify the proof of Theorem 6.5 of [9] directly. From\nthe Schl\u00e4fli formula (see [5], [7]), the change in volume V of a hyperbolic\ncone manifold during a deformation satisfies\nX \u03b1i d\u03b1i\n1X\nli d\u03b1i = \u2212\n.\ndV = \u2212\n2\n2ui\ni\n\ni\n\nWe will rewrite ui in terms of the function H, where H is given by (1).\nH was defined so that H(tanh(R)) is the reciprocal of the function\nh(R) = 3.3957\n\ntanh(R)\n,\ncosh(2R)\n\nwhich appears in the inequality (3). Provided R \u2265 0.531, this function h(R)\nis strictly decreasing, and thus we may define its inverse for x in the interval\n(0, h(0.531)] \u2248 (0, 1.019675]. Since \u03b1i li \u2264 0.5098, 2\u03b1i li \u2264 h(0.531). We\ndefine \u03c1i = h\u22121 (2\u03b1i li ). Letting zi = tanh(\u03c1i ), we have ui = 2\u03b12i H(zi ). So\nthe term \u2212\u03b1i /(2ui ) equals \u22121/(4\u03b1i H(zi )), and we obtain:\nX\n1\nd\u03b1i\n(5)\ndV = \u2212\n4\u03b1i H(zi )\ni\n\nNow, by inequality (4), we have:\n1 dui\ne i ).\n\u2264 4G(z\n\u03b1i d\u03b1i\n\n\fVOLUMES OF HIGHLY TWISTED KNOTS AND LINKS\n\n13\n\nWe compute:\n1 dui\n1 d\ndzi\n=\n(2\u03b12i H(zi )) = 4H(zi ) + 2\u03b1i H \u2032 (zi )\n.\n\u03b1i d\u03b1i\n\u03b1i d\u03b1i\nd\u03b1i\nHence\n\u03b1i H \u2032 (zi )\nwhich implies\n(6)\n\n\u2212\n\ndzi\ne i ) \u2212 H(zi ))\n\u2264 2(G(z\nd\u03b1i\n\nH \u2032 (zi )\n1\ndzi\n\u2265\n.\ne\n\u03b1i\n2(H(zi ) \u2212 G(zi )) d\u03b1i\n\nTo see that the direction of the inequalities is correct, notice that H(zi ) \u2212\ne i ) is positive.\nG(z\nNow, multiply the inequality (6) by 1/(4H(zi )).
