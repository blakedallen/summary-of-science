The goal of this work is to provide new Lagrangian formulations of selfdual gauge theories for spacetime dimensions equal to 2 modulo 4, i.e., D = 4p +\n2, for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, * * * . This includes chiral bosons in 2D, self-dual 3-form gauge\nfield for M5-brane in M theory and self-dual 5-form gauge field in type IIB superstring\ntheory. For simplicity we will assume that the spacetime is Minkowski space. It should\nbe straightforward to generalize the formulation to curved spacetime with Lorentzian\nsignature.\nLet us recall that the dual of a tensor T in D dimensions is defined as\nT\u0303\u03bc1 ***\u03bck \u2261\n\n1\n\u01eb\u03bc1 ***\u03bcD T \u03bck+1 ***\u03bcD .\n(D \u2212 k)!\n\n(1)\n\nThe self-duality condition of a gauge field is\nF \u2261 F \u2212 F\u0303 = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nApparently the field strength must be a D/2-form, and D must be even. Self-duality\nconditions are not consistent in D = 4p (p = 1, 2, 3, * * * ) dimensional Minkowski space,\nand they will not be considered in this work.\nIt is well known that, without auxiliary fields, a manifestly Lorentz invariant action\ncannot be found for self-dual gauge theory. In the literature on self-dual theories [1, 2],\na special (but arbitrary) direction has to be singled out to write down a Lagrangian.\nRecently, in the study of M theory, a new Lagrangian formulation of M5-brane in large\nC-field background [3, 4, 5], which is a self-dual gauge field theory in 6 dimensions,\nwas derived from the BLG model [6, 7] for multiple M2-branes. In this formulation,\nthe 6 coordinates of the base space are divided into two sets of 3 coordinates {xa }3a=1\nand {x\u0227 }3\u0227=1 , in contrast with the old formulation of M5-branes [8], which uses a decomposition of base space coordinates into two sets of 1 and 5 coordinates. While\nboth decompositions 6 = 1+5 and 6 = 3+3 admit Lagrangian formulations of self-dual\ntheories, the natural question is: does there exist a formulation corresponding to the\ndecomposition 6 = 2+4? More generally, for a self-dual gauge theory in D = 4p + 2\ndimensions (so the gauge field strength is a (2p + 1)-form), can we find a Lagrangian\nformulation for all possible decompositions D = D \u2032 + D \u2032\u2032 ?\nThe answer to the question above is yes. In the following, we provide new Lagrangian formulations for arbitrary spacetime decompositions. The action is given in\nsection 2, its gauge symmetry in section 3. The proof that the theory is a theory of\n1\n\n\fself-dual gauge fields is given separately for three classes of decompositions: (i) D \u2032 = D \u2032\u2032\n(section 4), (ii) D \u2032\u2032 > D \u2032 = odd (section 5) and (iii) D \u2032\u2032 > D \u2032 = even (section 6). We\nshow in section 7 that although the action is no longer manifestly invariant under those\nLorentz transformations which mix the two sets of coordinates in the decomposition,\nthe action is invariant under certain modified Lorentz transformation laws. In section\n8, we give the interaction term in the action to describe the coupling of the gauge field\nto a charged (2p \u2212 1)-brane. Explicit examples for (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032) = (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3)\nare given in section 9. We point out the relationship between our result and the holographic action of Belov and Moore [9] in section 10 and our conclusion will be given in\nsection 11.\n\n2\n\nAction\n\nWe decompose the D-dimensional Minkowski spacetime as a product space MD =\n\u2032\nD \u2032\u2032\n\u03bc\nMD\n1 \u00d7 M2 . Correspondingly, the spacetime coordinates {x |\u03bc = 1, * * * , D} are divided into two sets\n\u2032\n\na\n\u2032\nMD\n1 : {x |a = 1, * * * , D }\n\nand\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u0227\n\u2032\u2032\nMD\n2 : {x |\u0227 = 1, * * * , D }.\n\n(3)\n\nWe assume that D \u2032 \u2264 D \u2032\u2032 , so that 1 \u2264 D \u2032 \u2264 D/2. This is just a convention except\n\u2032\nthat when D \u2032 is even, the signature of MD\n1 must be Lorentzian, and the signature of\n\u2032\u2032\nMD\nEuclidean. The Lorentzian signature of spacetime can be either (+ \u2212 * * * \u2212) or\n2\n(\u2212 + * * * +). The expressions below are valid for both conventions.\nDue to the decomposition of the coordinates, the gauge potential A\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2p is naturally\ndecomposed into fields of different types depending on the number of dotted or undotted\nindices as\n{Aa1 ...aj \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212j |j = 0, . . . , D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1, },\n(4)\nwhere\n\u03b1 = \u03b4D\u2032 ,D/2\n\n(5)\n\nso that D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 = min(D \u2032 , 2p). D \u2032 is greater than 2p only for the special case (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032 ) =\n(D/2, D/2), and the parameters \u03b1 is used to keep track of whether the decomposition\nD = D \u2032 + D \u2032\u2032 happens to be the special case (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032) = (D/2, D/2). The indices\na1 * * * aj of A in (4) should be skipped altogether if j = 0, and \u02271 * * * \u02272p\u2212j skipped\naltogether when j = 2p. All expressions below should also be interpreted in this way.\n\n2\n\n\fNaturally, the totally antisymmetrized tensor in D dimensions is naturally decomposed into a product of the totally antisymmetrized tensor in D \u2032 and D \u2032\u2032 dimensions\n\u01eba1 ***aD\u2032 \u02271 ***\u0227D\u2032\u2032 = \u01eba1 ***aD\u2032 \u01eb\u02271 ***\u0227D\u2032\u2032 .\n\n(6)\n\nFor an arbitrary tensor T\u03bc1 ***\u03bck \u03bd1 ***\u03bdl \u03bck+1 ***\u03bcm ***, we will use the notation\nT[\u03bc1 ***\u03bck |\u03bd1 ***\u03bdl |\u03bck+1 ***\u03bcm ]*** \u2261\n\n1 X\nsgn(\u03c3)T\u03bc\u03c31 ***\u03bc\u03c3k \u03bd1 ***\u03bdl \u03bc\u03c3k+1 ***\u03bc\u03c3m *** ,\nm! \u03c3\n\n(7)\n\nP\nwhere the sum \u03c3 is carried out for all permutations of m objects and sgn(\u03c3) is the\nsignature of the permutation \u03c3.

In the following we\nwill show that the equations of motion derived from varying this action are equivalent\nto the condition of self-duality, and that this action is invariant under a hidden Lorentz\nsymmetry although it is not manifestly Lorentz invariant.\nIt was pointed out in [10] that the quantum theory of a self-dual gauge field is not\nunique on a generic spacetime. Instead there is a 1-1 correspondence between the spin\nstructure on the base space (spacetime) and the path integral of a self-dual gauge field.\nThe action proposed above is presumably the action suitable for spacetime with trivial\ntopology so that the spin structure is unique. We leave the issue on topology and the\ndefinition of quantum theory for generic spacetime manifold to future works.\n\n3\n\nGauge Symmetry\n\nThe self-duality condition\nF\u03bc1 ***\u03bcD/2 = 0\n\n(16)\n\ncan be decomposed into D \u2032 + 1 different types of equations\n(j = 0, 1, * * * , D \u2032 ).\n\nFa1 ***aj \u02271 ***\u0227D/2\u2212j = 0\n\n(17)\n\n(The quantity F vanishes identically if j > D \u2032 because F is totally antisymmetrized in\nall indices.) But not all of them are independent. In fact, only \u2308(D \u2032 +1)/2\u2309, roughly half,\n4\n\n\fof them are independent. (\u2308(D \u2032 + 1)/2\u2309 denotes the smallest integer not smaller than\n(D \u2032 +1)/2.) Hence the action, if it is correct, should produce \u2308(D \u2032 +1)/2\u2309 different types\nof independent equations of motion that are equivalent to these conditions. On the\nother hand, the number of different types of gauge potential components is (D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1)\n(see eq.(4)). Varying them in the action should give us (D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1) different types of\nequations of motion. Except the special case (D \u2032, D \u2032\u2032 ) = (1, 1), for which the number\nof equations of motion equals the number of self-duality conditions, for all other cases,\n(D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1) > \u2308(D \u2032 + 1)/2\u2309. Thus, in general, the equations of motion cannot be all\nindependent. The number of equations of motion that are trivial should be\n(D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1) \u2212 \u2308(D \u2032 + 1)/2\u2309 = \u2308D \u2032 /2\u2309 \u2212 \u03b1.\n\n(18)\n\nIt turns out that the action (13-15) has the special feature that many components\nof the gauge potential appear only in total derivative terms. Therefore, in addition to\nthe ordinary gauge symmetry\nA \u2192 A + d\u039b,\n(19)\nthe action is invariant under the following gauge transformations\n\u03b4Aa1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k = 0\n\u03b4Aa1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k = fa1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k (xa )\n\u03b4Aa1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k = \u03a6a1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k (xa , x\u0227 )\n\n(k = 0, 1, * * * , \u230aD \u2032 /2\u230b \u2212 1),\n(k = \u230aD \u2032 /2\u230b),\n(k = \u230aD \u2032 /2\u230b + 1, . . . , D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the f 's are functions independent of all x\u0227 's, and the \u03a6's are arbitrary functions.\nBy choosing \u03a6 suitably, (\u2308D \u2032 /2\u2309 \u2212 \u03b1) of the (D \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1) different types of A fields\ncan be gauged away. Thus there are only \u2308(D \u2032 + 1)/2\u2309 types of nontrivial equations of\nmotion, as it should be (see (18)). The gauge transformation parametrized by the f 's\nin (20) will play an important role when D = 2. The fact that the action is invariant\nunder the transformations (20) will be checked below when we compute the equations\nof motion.\nIn the following we will show case by case that, for (1) D \u2032 = D \u2032\u2032 , (2) D \u2032 < D \u2032\u2032\nwith D \u2032 odd, and (3) D \u2032 < D \u2032\u2032 with D \u2032 even, the space of solutions to the equations\nof motion defined by the action (13) is the same as the space of all self-dual field\nconfigurations. More specifically, the equations of motion in our theory (for those gauge\npotential components that cannot be gauged away) are 2nd order differential equations\nwhich can be integrated into 1st order differential equations with arbitrary functions\nintroduced as integral \"constants\". These additional functions can be identified with\nthose components of the gauge potential that are gauged away, or as a shift of those\n5\n\n\ffields that can be absorbed by a field redefinition. After this identification, the 1st\norder differential equations are exactly identical to the self-duality conditions.\nStrictly speaking, the derivation given below only implies that every solution to the\nequations of motion of our theory correspond to a self-dual configuration, but it does\nnot immediately imply that every self-dual configuration can find its counterpart in our\ntheory. To prove that the space of solutions for our theory is really the same as the\nspace of self-dual configurations, one needs to count the number of free components\nin A and examine the constraints (equations of motion or self-duality conditions). We\nhave carried out this straightforward yet tedious proof case by case but will skip it here.\n\n4\n\nD \u2032 = D \u2032\u2032\n\nFor the special case D \u2032 = D \u2032\u2032 =\nlaws (20) are\n\nD\n2\n\n= 2p + 1 (and so \u03b1 = 1), the gauge transformation\n\n\u03b4Aa1 ...a2p\u2212k \u02271 ...\u0227k = \u03a6a1 ...a2p\u2212k \u02271 ...\u0227k (xa , x\u0227 ),\n\u03b4Aa1 ...a2p\u2212k \u02271 ...\u0227k = f a1 ...a2p\u2212k \u02271 ...\u0227k (xa ),\n\u03b4Aa1 ...a2p\u2212k \u02271 ...\u0227k = 0,\n\nk = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1,\nk = p,\nk = p + 1, . . . , 2p,\n\n(21)\n\nin addition to the usual gauge transformation (19).

The interaction between the (2p \u2212 1)-brane and the\nfield should preserve all the gauge symmetry. In particular, the new gauge symmetry\n(20) are needed in order to have first order differential equations as equations of motion.\nWe find the interaction term of the action to be given by\nint\nSD\n\u2032 +D \u2032\u2032\n\n=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nD\nX\nFa1 ...aD\u2032 \u2212j \u02271 ...\u0227D/2\u2212D\u2032 +j Qa1 ...aD\u2032 \u2212j \u02271 ...\u0227D/2\u2212D\u2032 +j\n\u2032\n\nD\n\nd x\n\n\u2032\nj=\u2308 D2 \u2309\n\n(D \u2032 \u2212 j)!( D\n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212D \u2032\n\n2\n\n+ j)!2\u03b4j,D\u2032 /2\n\n,\n\n(88)\n\nwhere\nQ = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u0303\n\n(89)\n\nis a (2p+1)-form and \u03c3 represents the source. Roughly speaking, the source term (\u03c3\nand its Hodge dual \u03c3\u0303) should be determined by a Dirac delta function which specifies\nthe location of the (2p \u2212 1)-brane. We will give explicit examples below.\nWith the interaction term (88) added, the modified equations of motion can again\nbe reduced to first order differential equation using the additional gauge symmetries\neq.(20) as\n(F + Q)a1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k \u1e03 = 0,\n\n(90)\n\nsaying that F is no longer self-dual but F + \u03c3 is. At the same time the equations of\nmotion imply\n\u2202 \u1e03 (F + Q)a1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k \u1e03 = 0,\n\n(91)\n\nBy means of the Bianchi identity, we can rewrite eq.(91) in following form which was\nobtained earlier in [9]:\n\u2202 \u1e03 (F + \u03c3)a1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k \u1e03 + \u2202 b (F\u0303 + \u03c3\u0303)ba1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c3\u0303\u03bca1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k .\n\n(92)\n\nAlthough it appears that the effect of the source term is merely to replace F by F +\u03c3\nin both equations of motion (90) and (91), one cannot redefine F to absorb \u03c3. The\nreason is that, although F and \u03c3 are both (2p + 1)-forms, F is a closed differential form\nwhile \u03c3 is not. This also explains why there is an additional term on the right-hand\nside of (92).\nTo be more explicit, let us give some examples for each type of spacetime decomposition:\n15\n\n\f1.

(95)\n\nl=2p\u2212k+1\n\nl=k+1\n\nHere the value of k is a fixed number used to specify how the 2p-dimensional world\u2032\nD \u2032\u2032\nvolume of the source brane is divided into MD\n1 \u00d7 M2 . We use the divergence of \u03c3\u0303\nto define \u03c3, with all other components of the divergence of \u03c3\u0303 vanishing. These divergence relations do not determine \u03c3 uniquely but different solutions of \u03c3 are equivalent.\u2217\nThe xl 's and \u1e8bl 's appearing in the delta functions (there are 2p + 2 of them) are the\ncoordinates transverse to the brane.\nIn order for the brane to be time-like, one should choose the non-vanishing components of \u2202 * \u03c3\u0303 to have a time-like index. This imposes a constraint on the choice of\n\u2032\n\u2202 * \u03c3\u0303 for the D \u2032 = even case because the coordinate space {xa } of MD\n1 is of Lorentzian\nsignature.\nFor the source given above, the equation of motion (92) becomes\n\u2202 \u1e03 (F + \u03c3)x1 ***xk \u1e8b1 ***\u1e8b2p\u2212k \u1e03 + \u2202 b (F\u0303 + \u03c3\u0303)bx1 ***xk \u1e8b1 ***\u1e8b2p\u2212k\n\uf8f1 2p+1\n2p+1\nY\nY\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b4(\u1e8bl ), (D \u2032 = D \u2032\u2032 ),\n\u03b4(x\n)\n\uf8f4\nl\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nl=2p\u2212k+1\nl=k+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n4p\u22122q+1\n\uf8f2 2q+1\nY\nY\n\u03b4(\u1e8bl ), (D \u2032 = odd),\n\u03b4(xl )\n=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nl=2p\u2212k+1\nl=k+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n4p\u22122r\n2r+2\n\uf8f4\nY\nY\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b4(\u1e8bl ), (D \u2032 = even).\n\u03b4(x\n)\nl\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nl=k+1\n\n\u2217\n\n(96)\n\nl=2p\u2212k+1\n\nA more familiar expression of the interaction term is of the form A * j for some current j. In (88)\nthe interaction term is of the form \u2212F * Q, and since F = dA, it is equivalent to A * dQ up to a total\nderivative. Thus dQ is the current j coupled to A.\n\n16\n\n\f9\n\nExamples\n\n9.1\n\nD = 2, (D\u2032 , D\u2032\u2032 ) = (1, 1)\n\nThe simplest example of self-dual field theory is the two-dimensional theory of chiral\nbosons. The only possible decomposition of the 2D Minkowski space is\nR1+1 = R \u00d7 R.\n\n(97)\n\nWe use x1 and x1\u0307 to denote the coordinates on each factor of R. Either x1 or x1\u0307 can\nbe time-like, and the other one space-like.\nThe gauge potential has no index and has only one component which will be denoted\nas \u03c6. The action is\nZ\n1\nd2 xF 1\u0307 F1\u0307 ,\n(98)\nS1+1 = \u2212\n2\nwhere F1\u0307 = \u22021\u0307 \u03c6 and F\u0303 1\u0307 = \u22021 \u03c6. It is the same as the action given in [2]. Note that this\naction is invariant under the gauge transformation (the second line in (20))\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + f (x1 )\n\n(99)\n\nfor an arbitrary function f (x1 ) that is independent of x1\u0307 . This is a larger gauge symmetry than the usual gauge symmetry for a 0-form gauge potential, which is restricted\nto constant f .\nThe action is not manifestly Lorentz invariant. Define the modified Lorentz transformation law\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03bba\u0227 (xa \u2202\u0227 \u2212 x\u0227 \u2202a )\u03c6 + \u03bba\u0227 x\u0227 Fa \u2261 \u03b41 \u03c6 + \u03b42 \u03c6,\n(100)\nwhere\n\u03b41 \u03c6 = \u03bba\u0227 (xa \u2202\u0227 \u2212 x\u0227 \u2202a )\u03c6,\n\n\u03b42 \u03c6 = \u03bba\u0227 x\u0227 Fa .\n\n(101)\n\nWhen F = 0, \u03b42 \u03c6 = 0 and \u03b41 \u03c6 is the usual Lorentz transformation law.

It was later extended to the full interacting M5-brane theory in [4], and the\nself-duality conditions in the nonlinear version of the pure gauge theory were explicitly\nexamined in [12], and the full theory including interactions between gauge fields and\nmatter fields is analyzed in [13].\nThe gauge potential has the following components\nAab ,\n\nAa\u0227 ,\n\nA\u0227\u1e03\n\n(a, b = 1, 2, 3; \u0227, \u1e03 = 1\u0307, 2\u0307, 3\u0307),\n\n(134)\n\nwhere the indices a = (1, 2, 3) and \u0227 = (1\u0307, 2\u0307, 3\u0307), correspond, respectively, to the SO(2, 1)\nand SO(3) subgroup of the full D = 6 Lorentz group.

Through a suitable gauge transformation (137), it\ncan be reduced to\nFa\u0227\u1e03 = 0.\n(141)\n21\n\n\fSubstituting (141) into (139), we solve the latter as\nF\u0227\u1e03\u010b = \u01eb\u0227\u1e03\u010b f (xa ),\n\n(142)\n\nwhere f (x) is a function depending only on the coordinates xa but not on x\u0227 . Since\nf (x) can always be written as \u2202 a fa for some fields fa (xb ), it can be absorbed by a\nfield redefinition Aab \u2192 Aab + \u01ebabc f c . One can check that this does not spoil the selfduality condition (141) we obtained earlier. Hence we finally have the other self-duality\ncondition,\nF\u0227\u1e03\u010b = 0.\n(143)\nTogether with (141), they constitute the full self-duality conditions for the 6D self-dual\ngauge field A.\n\n10\n\nComparison with the holographic action\n\nThe results presented above are closely related to the work of Belov and Moore [9].\n\u2020\nThey defined an action, which is called the holographic action, for self-dual gauge\nfields, based on a decomposition of the space of (2p + 1)-forms VR . In their notation,\nVR = V2 \u2295 V2\u22a5 , where V2\u22a5 = \u2217E V2 is the orthogonal complement with respect to the\nHodge metric. (The subscript E stands for Euclidean, as the formulation starts with a\nWick-rotated space with Euclidean signature.) Thus, in particular, a field strength F\ncan be decomposed as F = F2 + F2\u22a5 . (F is denoted as R in [9].)\n\u2032\nD \u2032\u2032\nThe decomposition of spacetime MD = MD\nwe considered in this paper\n1 \u00d7 M2\nalso leads to a decomposition of the space of differential forms. For (2p + 1)-forms, we\ncan choose\nV2\u22a5 = {dxa1 * * * dxak dx\u02271 * * * dx\u02272p\u2212k+1 |k = 0, 1, * * * , \u230aD \u2032/2\u230b}.\n\n(144)\n\nFor a given field strength F , the part of F2\u22a5 depends only on the components\n{Aa1 ***ak \u02271 ***\u02272p\u2212k |k = 0, 1, * * * , \u230aD \u2032 /2\u230b}\n\n(145)\n\nof the gauge potential, and these are exactly the components of the gauge potential\nthat cannot be gauged away in our formulation (see, e.g, (20)). The decomposing the\nspace of the field strength F as in the work of Belov and Moore is thus implied by our\nclassification of the gauge potential components A.\n\u2020\n\nWe thank Yuji Tachikawa for pointing out this reference to us after the first version of this paper\nappeared on arXiv.\n\n22\n\n\fAnother technical difference between these two approaches is that we used the\nequations of motion to prove the self-duality condition, while Belov and Moore used\nthe equations of motion to prove that the (2p + 1)-form F + \u2261 F2\u22a5 + \u2217F2\u22a5 , which\nis by definition self-dual, is closed. Nevertheless, since the self-dual field strength is\ncompletely fixed by the part F2\u22a5 in V2\u22a5 , the full field strength is the same independent\nof whether the rest of the components are obtained by definition as \u2217F2\u22a5 , or obtained\nby solving equations of motion which lead to self-duality conditions.\nApart from these technical details, our work can be viewed as an application of the\nholographic action [9] with a special choice of the decomposition of VR . The work of\nBelov and Moore [9] is more general and has the advantage of being able to deal with\ntopological issues more properly. They have also shown how to couple D-branes to the\nself-dual fields. Our work is on the other hand focused on a special realization of their\ngeneral formulation, giving explicit expressions of the action in terms of gauge potential\ncomponents, and explicit expressions for Lorentz transformation laws. This is achieved\nby realizing that the construction of a self-dual field theory is naturally connected with\nthe decomposition of space-time, when it is a product space.\n\n11\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this work we constructed Lagrange formulations for self-dual gauge theories in D =\n4p + 2 dimensions (p = 0, 1, 2, * * * ) for arbitrary decomposition D = D \u2032 + D \u2032\u2032 . In\naddition to the ordinary gauge symmetry\nA(2p) \u2192 A(2p) + d\u039b(2p\u22121) ,\n\n(146)\n\nthe action (13)-(15) is invariant under additional gauge transformations, which allow\nus to gauge away some of the components of A, leaving the following components\nAa1 ...ak \u02271 ...\u02272p\u2212k\n\n(k = 0, 1, * * * , \u230aD \u2032 /2\u230b)\n\n(147)\n\nas dynamical variables satisfying 2nd order differential equations. In the process of\nsolving the equations of motion for these remaining components of A, additional fields\n\u03a6 are introduced when 2nd order differential equations are integrated to 1st order\ndifferential equations. Together with those components of A in (147), the fields \u03a6 are\nto be identified with the rest of the components of the self-dual configuration. Despite\nthe fact that the action is not manifestly Lorentz invariant, it enjoys the full Lorentz\nsymmetry with a modified transformation law (81).\n23\n\n\fPotential applications of our new formulations of self-dual gauge theories include\nrewriting a self-dual gauge theory, say, the action of type IIB supergravity for decompositions other than (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032 ) = (1, 9), which was already constructed in [11] Other\ndecompositions (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032) may be more convenient when specific backgrounds are considered, e.g. when the spacetime is naturally viewed as a product space. For example,\nthe decomposition (D \u2032 , D \u2032\u2032 ) = (5, 5) will be especially convenient when we try to construct new solutions of IIB supergravity as deformations of the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Chien-Ho Chen, Kazuyuki Furuuchi, Yu-Tin Huang, Sheng-Lan Ko,\nSangmin Lee, Paolo Pasti, Dmitri Sorokin, Yuji Tachikawa, Tomohisa Takimi, Daniel\nThompson and Chi-Hsien Yeh.
