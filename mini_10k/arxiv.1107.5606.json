Introduction\nAlmost 60 % of all stellar mass in massive galaxies in the local Universe is contained in bulges and elliptical galaxies (e.g.,\nGadotti 2009).

Johnson is a guest professor at Lund University\n1\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\nit is clear that understanding the origin and evolution of bulges\nis integral to the theory of galaxy formation. The central part of\nour own Milky Way harbours a central bulge which enables us\nto study such a stellar system in a detail impossible for any other\ngalaxy (e.g., Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004 for a review of bulges\nin general). For instance, the next closest bulge stellar system\nis that of the Andromeda galaxy which is more than a hundred\ntimes more distant. In spite of its \"proximity\" and the many detailed spectroscopic and photometric studies during the last few\ndecades, the origin and evolutionary history of the Galactic bulge\nis still poorly understood. Its generally very old stellar population, metal-rich nature, and over-abundances of \u03b1-elements (e.g.,\nMcWilliam & Rich 1994; Zoccali et al. 2006; Fulbright et al.\n2007; Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2008; Bensby et al. 2010c) are consistent\nwith a classical bulge formed during the collapse of the protogalaxy and subsequent mergers, which would have resulted in\nan intense burst of star formation (e.g., White & Rees 1978;\nMatteucci & Brocato 1990; Ferreras et al. 2003; Rahimi et al.\n2010). Alternatively, the boxy/peanut-like shape of the bulge\nsuggests an origin through dynamical instabilities in an already\nestablished inner disk (e.g., Maihara et al. 1978; Combes et al.\n1990; Shen et al. 2010). Such secular evolution could possibly explain the recent discovery of chemical similarities between the bulge and the Galactic thick disk as observed in the\nsolar neighbourhood (Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2008; Alves-Brito et al.\n2010; Bensby et al. 2010c; Gonzalez et al. 2011), through the\naction of radial migration of stars (Sellwood & Binney 2002;\nSch\u00f6nrich & Binney 2009; Loebman et al. 2011).\nThe metallicity distribution function of the bulge, inferred\nfrom photometric and spectroscopic studies of red giant stars,\npeaks around the solar value with a significant fraction of supersolar metallicity stars and a low-metallicity tail extending down\nto at least [Fe/H]\u2248 \u22121 (e.g., Sadler et al. 1996; Zoccali et al.\n2003, 2008; Fulbright et al. 2007). Indeed, there are ample indications that the Bulge should harbour substantially more metalpoor stars (e.g., Bensby et al. 2010b). In fact, the very first stars,\nshould any have survived to the present day, may well preferentially be found in the central regions of Milky Way-type galaxies (e.g., Wyse & Gilmore 1992; Brook et al. 2007; Tumlinson\n2010). Unfortunately, the high stellar densities in the bulge and\nits generally high metallicity makes finding such stellar survivors\nfrom the earliest cosmic epochs very challenging although several large-scale spectroscopic surveys of the Bulge are currently\nunderway, which may discover some of these extremely old stars\n(e.g., Howard et al. 2009).\nStudies of the detailed chemistry of the bulge have so far\nmainly used intrinsically bright stars (as in the references above).\nHowever, results based on spectra from giant stars are not trivial\nto interpret as evolutionary processes erase some of the abundance information. Also, their relatively cool atmospheres result\nin spectra rich in lines from molecules, which are difficult to\nanalyse (e.g., Fulbright et al. 2006). The spectra of dwarf stars,\non the other hand, even metal-rich ones, are fairly straightforward to analyse and are the best tracers of Galactic chemical\nevolution (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993). The main difficulty with\nobserving dwarf stars in the bulge is their faintness (V = 19 \u221220,\nFeltzing & Gilmore 2000), impeding spectroscopic observations\nunder normal circumstances. To obtain a spectrum of high quality (R & 40 000 and S /N & 75) of a bulge dwarf star would\nrequire, even if using the largest 8-10 meter telescopes available\ntoday, an exposure time of more than 50 hours. Microlensing offers the unique opportunity to observe dwarf stars in the bulge.\nIn the event that the bulge dwarf star is lensed by a foreground\nobject, its brightness can increase by a factor of several hun2\n\ndred, making it possible to obtain, in 1 to 2 hours, a spectrum\nof sufficiently high resolution and S /N, adequate for an accurate\ndetailed elemental abundance analysis.\nBy observing microlensed dwarf stars in the bulge several\nrecent studies have given a new perspective on the chemical\nproperties of the bulge (Johnson et al. 2007, 2008; Cohen et al.\n2008, 2009, 2010; Bensby et al. 2009a,b, 2010b,c; Epstein et al.\n2010). Main findings so far include the first age-metallicity\nrelation in the bulge which shows that metal-poor stars are\ngenerally old, but metal-rich ones have a wide range of ages\n(Bensby et al. 2010c). In addition, abundance ratios for 14 elements studied in the bulge dwarfs at sub-solar metallicities\nare in excellent agreement with the abundance patterns in local\nthick disk stars (e.g., Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2008; Bensby et al. 2010c;\nAlves-Brito et al. 2010). Also, Bensby et al. (2010b) presented\nthe first clear detection of Li in a bulge dwarf star, showing that\nthe bulge follows the Spite plateau (Spite & Spite 1982). The\nmost striking result to date from microlensed dwarf stars is that\nthe metallicity distribution function (MDF) for dwarf stars and\ngiant stars in the Galactic bulge differs. In Bensby et al. (2010c)\nwe found that the bulge MDF appeared bimodal for the dwarf\nstars, with a paucity at the metallicity where the MDF based on\ngiant stars in Baade's window from Zoccali et al. (2008) peaks.\nUnderstanding this discrepancy is vital when studying external\ngalaxies where dwarf stars can not be studied, where we have to\nrely on the integrated light from all stars, which is dominated by\ngiant stars.\nThese results illustrate that observations of dwarf stars provide unique information on the evolution of the bulge. For example, the microlensed bulge dwarf stars will have an important impact on the modelling of the bulge, in particular regarding recent suggestions that the initial mass function (IMF) in\nthe bulge needs to be different from that in the solar neighbourhood in order to explain the MDF based on red giant\nstars (Cescutti & Matteucci 2011). Additionally, combining the\ndwarf abundances and kinematics with numerical studies, e.g.,\nRahimi et al. (2010), points to the possibility of disentangling\ndifferent formation scenarios for the bulge, e.g. secular versus\nmerger origin.\nIn this paper we report the most recent findings from our ongoing project on the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge\nas traced by dwarf and subgiant stars that have been observed\nwhilst being optically magnified during microlensing events.\nAdding eleven new events, and a re-analysis of MOA-2009BLG-259S, the sample now consists of in total 26 microlensed\ndwarf and subgiant stars in the bulge that have been homogeneously analysed.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nThe twelve (11 new and one re-analysis) microlensing events\npresented in this study were all discovered by the MOA microlensing alert system1 (e.g., Bond et al. 2001). Most stars were\nobserved on the night when the microlensing events peaked, and\nas close to peak brightness (Amax ) as possible (the light curves\nare shown in Fig. 1). Exceptions are MOA-2009-BLG-174S and\nMOA-2011-BLG-058S which were observed one day ahead of\npeak brightness as the full Moon would be very close on the\nnight of the predicted Amax . As can be seen in Fig. 1, the brightnesses for most events were almost constant, or only slowly\nvarying, when the spectroscopic observations were carried out.\n1\n\nhttps://it019909.massey.ac.nz/moa/alert/index.html\n\n\fT.

Light curves for the twelve new microlensing events. Each plot has a zoom window, showing the time intervals when the\nsource stars were observed with high-resolution spectrographs. In each plot the un-lensed magnitude of the source star is also given\n(IS ).\nThe event that showed most variation during the observations is MOA-2010-BLG-285S; from I \u2248 14.3 at the start of\nthe 2 hour exposure to I \u2248 13.3 at the end, i.e., it more than\ndoubled its brightness during the observations. Furthermore, this\nmicrolensing event has a binary lens and the UVES observations were carried out during, or very close to, a caustic crossing. In Bensby et al. (2010b), where we presented the first results for MOA-2010-BLG-285S and reported its Li abundance,\nwe showed that even though the three UVES exposures not only\ndiffered in magnification, but also in magnification across the\nstellar surface, the joint effect is an even magnification across\nthe stellar surface. Hence, the final co-added spectrum should\nnot be affected. As the model light curve for this event requires\nmore analysis, which will be published elsewhere, the light curve\nin Fig. 1 currently only contains the observed data points and\nno model fit. Due to a possible planet detection in the lens, the\nmodel light curve for MOA-2010-BLG-523S also needs more\nanalysis, and therefore also only have observed data points in\nFig. 1. MOA-2011-BLG-034S is an event with a binary lens and\n\nthe microlensing model needs more work. Hence, we have currently no Amax , T E , or model curve (but only the observed data\npoints in Fig. 1) for MOA-2011-BLG-2011-034S.\nTen of the twelve events were observed in 2010 and 2011\nwith the UVES spectrograph (Dekker et al. 2000) on the Very\nLarge Telescope as part of our ongoing Target of Opportunity\n(ToO) program. They were observed with a 1.0 arcsec wide slit\nand dichroic #2, giving spectra with a resolution of R \u2248 42 000\nand a spectral coverage between 3760-4980 \u00c5 (blue ccd), 56807500 \u00c5 (lower red ccd), and 7660-9460 \u00c5 (upper red ccd). A featureless spectrum of a rapidly rotating B star (either HR 6141 or\nHR 7830) was obtained each time. This spectrum was used to\ndivide out telluric lines in the bulge star spectrum. The signalto-noise ratios at 6400 \u00c5 are listed in Table 1 and range between\n35 and 150. Reductions were carried out with the UVES pipeline\n(Ballester et al. 2000), version 4.7.8, using the gasgano interface.\nThe UVES data were complemented with data for two stars\nobserved in 2009. MOA-2009-BLG-259S was observed with the\nHIRES-R spectrograph (Vogt et al. 1994) on the Keck telescopes\n3\n\n\fT.

The slit was 0.86 arcsec wide, giving a spectral resolution of R \u2248 48 000, a wavelength coverage from 3900 to\n8350 \u00c5, with small gaps between the orders beyond 6650 \u00c5. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio is S /N \u2248 110 per pixel around 6400 \u00c5.\nDetails of the reduction procedure can be found in Cohen et al.\n(2008). Actually, an analysis of MOA-2009-BLG-259S was first\npresented in Bensby et al. (2010c). However, that analysis was\nbased on a spectrum that was obtained with UVES and when\nonly the UVES blue arm was available due to maintenance work\non the red arm. That spectrum had a very limited blue wavelength coverage and as bulge stars are heavily reddened, it also\nhad poor S/N. As a result only a few Fe i and Fe ii could be\nmeasured and the stellar parameters were poorly constrained\nwith large uncertainties. Hence, in Bensby et al. (2010c), MOA2009-BLG-259S was excluded when discussing the metallicity distribution and abundance trends of the microlensed bulge\ndwarf stars. The first metallicity result, based on this HIRES\nspectrum, was presented in Cohen et al. (2010). For consistency,\nit has here been re-analysed with the same methods as for all the\nother events.\n\nMOA-2009-BLG-174S was observed with the MIKE spectrograph (Bernstein et al. 2003) on the Magellan Clay telescope\nat the Las Campanas observatory in Chile. A 0.7 arcsec wide\nslit was used giving a spectrum with R \u2248 42 000 and continuous\ncoverage between 3500 to 9200 \u00c5. The signal-to-noise per pixel\nat 6400 \u00c5 is around 95. Reductions were made with the Carnegie\npython pipeline2.\nIn total we are now in possession of high quality spectra for\n26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the bulge. Table 1\nlists the details for the twelve new events, while the data for the\nother 14 events can be found in Bensby et al. (2010c).\n\n3. Analysis\n3.1.

(For consistency with our previous analyses, we continue\nto use the old MARCS models. As shown in Gustafsson et al.\n2008, the differences between the new and old MARCS models are very small for our types of stars, i.e. F and G dwarf\nstars.) Elemental abundances are calculated with the Uppsala\nEQWIDTH program using equivalent widths that were measured by hand using the IRAF task SPLOT. Effective temperatures were determined from excitation balance of abundances\nfrom Fe i lines, surface gravities from ionisation balance between abundances from Fe i and Fe ii lines, and the microtur-\n\nObject\n\u2020\n\nOGLE-2006-BLG-265S\nOGLE-2007-BLG-349S\u2020\nMOA-2008-BLG-311S\u2020\nMOA-2010-BLG-049S\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S\nMOA-2010-BLG-523S\n\nlog \u01eb(Li)LTE\n\n\u2206NLTE\n\n0.96\n0.89\n2.23\n1.43\n2.21\n1.64\n\n+0.08\n+0.11\n+0.01\n+0.07\n\u22120.05\n+0.10\n\nT eff [K] [Fe/H]\n5486\n5229\n5944\n5738\n6064\n5250\n\n+0.47\n+0.42\n+0.36\n\u22120.38\n\u22121.23\n+0.09\n\n\u2020\n\nFull set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances for\nOGLE-2006-BLG-265S, OGLE-2007-BLG-349S, and MOA-2008-BLG-311S\nare given in Bensby et al.

(2010), has\nbeen performed for the microlensed dwarf stars. This method\ntakes into account the uncertainties in the four observables that\nwere used to find the stellar parameters, i.e. the uncertainty of\nthe slope in the graph of Fe i abundances versus lower excitation potential; the uncertainty of the slope in the graph of Fe i\nabundances versus line strength; the uncertainty in the difference\nbetween Fe i and Fe ii abundances; and the uncertainty in the difference between input and output metallicities.

(2004b).\n\nhow the average abundances for each element reacts to changes\nin the stellar parameters. Compared to Epstein et al. (2010), who\nused Ca i lines to constrain the microturbulence parameter, we\nuse the same Fe i lines that were used for the effective temperature. Although the variables are not fully independent, they are\nonly weakly correlated. Thus the total error bar is dominated by\nthe uncertainties in the slopes.\nStellar parameters and error estimates are given in Table 2,\nelemental abundance ratios in Table 4, and measured equivalent\nwidths and abundances for individual lines in Table 5.\nWe have also determined NLTE Li abundances in 6 of the 26\nmicrolensed dwarf stars through line profile fitting of the 7 Li i\nresonance doublet line at 670.8 nm. The 1-D NLTE corrections\nare taken from Lind et al. (2009). The Li line was not detected\nin the remaining 20 stars, and the spectra are not of sufficient\nquality to estimate interesting upper limits. The method we use\nto determine Li abundances is fully described in Bensby et al.\n(2010b) where we presented the Li abundance in MOA-2010BLG-285S. The Li abundances are listed in Table 6.\n6\n\n3.2. Stellar ages and absolute magnitudes\n\nThe determination of stellar ages has been greatly improved in\nrelation to our previous work, by the use of probability distribution functions. Furthermore, the Yonsei-Yale isochrones\n(Demarque et al. 2004) have been calibrated to reproduce the\nsolar age and solar mass for the input solar stellar parameters\n(T eff / log g/[Fe/H] = 5777 K/4.44/0.00). This is described in\ndetail in a forthcoming paper (Melendez et al., in prep.). In short,\nfor a given set of \"observed\" stellar parameters (T eff , log g,\n[Fe/H]) and theoretical isochrone points (effective temperature\nT , logarithm of surface gravity G, and metallicity M), the age\nis determined from an isochrone age probability distribution\n(APD):\nX\n1\ndP(age) =\np (T eff , log g, [Fe/H], T, G, M) ,\n(1)\n\u2206(age) \u2206(age)\nwhere \u2206(age) is an adopted step in age from the grid of\nisochrones and:\np \u221d exp[\u2212(T eff \u2212 T )2 /2(\u2206T eff )2 ] \u00d7\n\n\fT.

The 12 new microlensed stars plotted on the \u03b1-enhanced isochrones from Demarque et al. (2004). Each set of isochrones\nhave been calculated with the same metallicity and \u03b1-enhancement as derived for the stars. In each plot the solid lines represent\nisochrones with ages of 5, 10, and 15 Gyr (from left to right). Dotted lines are isochrones in steps of 1 Gyr, ranging from 0.1 Gyr\nto 20 Gyr. Error bars represent the uncertainties in T eff and log g as given in Table 2. Note that ages reported in Table 3 need not\ncoincide exactly with the ages that may be read off directly from the figures. The age determinations are based on probability\ndistribution functions and is described in Sect. 3.\nexp[\u2212(log g \u2212 G)2 /2(\u2206 log g)2 ] \u00d7\nexp[\u2212([Fe/H] \u2212 M)2 /2(\u2206[Fe/H])2 ] .\n\n(2)\n\nThe errors in the derived stellar parameters (\u2206T eff , etc.) are\nlisted in Table 2. The sum in Eq. (1) is made over a range of\nisochrone ages and in principle all values of T, G, M. In practice, the contribution to the sum from isochrone points farther\naway than T eff \u00b1 3\u2206T eff , etc., is negligible. Therefore, the sum\nis limited to isochrone points within a radius of three times the\nerrors around the observed stellar parameters.\nThe probability\nP\ndistributions are normalised so that dP = 1. The most probable age is obtained from the peak of the distribution while 1 \u03c3\nlimits are derived from the shape of the probability distribution.\nSimilar formalisms allow us to infer the stellar mass, absolute\nmagnitudes, and luminosities.\nFor three very old stars (> 12 Gyr), both the peak and the\nupper error bar of the APD are not well defined. In those cases\n\nwe adopted as the age the average of the APD peak and the median of the solutions, and the upper error bar was adopted as the\nscatter of the solutions. The probability distributions for mass,\nabsolute magnitudes, and luminosities are all well behaved.\nUsing the new improved age determination method we have\nre-determined the ages for all 26 stars. The ages, absolute magnitudes, and luminosities are reported in Table 3, and Fig. 2 shows\nthe twelve new microlensed dwarf stars together with the relevant Y2 isochrones. As can be seen, a majority of the stars are\neither main sequence turn-off stars or subgiant stars, while two\nor three are on the verge of ascending the giant branch. The latter\nones have just left the subgiant branch, and should be un-affected\nby the internal mixing processes that occur further up on the giant branch (see, e.g., Pinsonneault 1997, for a review on mixing\nin stars).\nThe masses and luminosities presented in Table 3 will yield\na \"physical\" log g, computed from the fundamental relationship\n7\n\n\fT.

The microlensing temperature for MOA-2010-BLG-311S is\nthe one based on the original (V \u2212 I)0 colour (i.e. T eff = 4750 K). Note that no attempts to match individual lines has been made.

Bayesian methods have been developed to tackle\nthese problems (e.g., Pont & Eyer 2004; J\u00f8rgensen & Lindegren\n2005; Casagrande et al. 2011) but we do not follow this approach and therefore our ages could be in principle further improved. Nevertheless, our current age determination is consistent\nwith our previous work on thin/thick disk stars so, in a relative\nsense, our discussions regarding the ages of our sample stars are\nstill reliable.\n3.3. Effective temperatures from microlensing techniques\n\nFig. 4. Comparison between out spectroscopic surface gravities\nand the \"physical\" log g that can be computed from the luminosities and stellar masses inferred from isochrones. On average the physical log g:s are 0.03 dex higher (with a dispersion of\n0.09 dex).\n\nthat relates luminosity, stellar mass, and effective temperature\n(see, e.g., Eq. (4) in Bensby et al. 2003). Because a star with the\nbest-fit age may not lie exactly at the spectroscopically measured\nT eff and log g, the the physical and spectroscopic log g:s agree\nwithin 0.03 \u00b1 0.09 dex, rather than exactly, see Fig. 4.\nProbabilistic age determinations like ours are known to\nsuffer from systematic biases mainly related to the sampling\n8\n\nAs in Bensby et al. (2010c) we confront the effective temperatures derived from spectroscopic principles with those deduced\nfrom microlensing techniques (Yoo et al. 2004). The microlensing method assumes that the reddening towards the microlensed\nsource is the same as the reddening towards the red clump, and\nthat the red clump in the Bulge has (V \u2212 I)0 = 1.08 (Bensby et al.\n2010c) and MI = \u22120.15 (David Nataf, private communication). The de-reddened magnitude and colour are then derived\nfrom the offsets between the microlensing source and the red\nclump, in the instrumental colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).\nAs the lenses for the MOA-2010-BLG-285S and -523S events\nlikely are binaries, and need more work, no absolute magnitudes could be estimated for these stars. Also, the (V \u2212 I)0\ncolour for MOA-2010-BLG-446S could not be determined because there are too few clump stars close to this star in the\n\n\fT.

(a) Difference between the spectroscopic temperatures\nand the temperatures from microlensing techniques versus effective temperature, and (b) the difference between (V \u2212 I)0\ncolours determined from microlensing techniques and those that\ncan be determined from the spectroscopic temperatures using\nthe IRF M calibration by Casagrande et al. (2010). The average\ndifferences are h\u2206T eff i = \u221280 K with a dispersion of 217 K,\nand h\u2206(V \u2212 I)0 i = 0.026 with a dispersion of 0.073 mag. The\nthree stars that show largest deviations between microlensing\nand spectroscopic parameters are marked. For MOA-2010-BLG311S (mb10311) the original values are shown with open circles,\nand the corrected value with filled circles (connected with the\noriginal values by a dash-dotted line).\n\ncolour-magnitude diagram. From the colour-[Fe/H]-T eff calibrations by Casagrande et al. (2010) we can determine which temperatures the (V \u2212 I)0 colours correspond to. The absolute dereddened magnitudes and colours and the effective temperatures\nare given in Table 3.\nEven though the effective temperatures from microlensing\ntechniques and spectroscopic principles are in reasonable agreement, there are three events for which the differences are disturbingly large; more than 400 K for MOA-2009-BLG-259S and\nMOA-2009-BLG-489S, and more than 700 K for MOA-2010BLG-311S (Fig. 5a). Note that stellar parameters for MOA2009-BLG-489S were published in Bensby et al. (2010c). To\ncheck the temperatures for these stars, and get a third opinion, we calculate synthetic spectra for the H\u03b1 line wing profiles with the latest version (v2.1 oct 2010) of the Spectroscopy\nMade Easy (SME) tool (Valenti & Piskunov 1996) using the\nlatest 1-D LTE plane-parallel MARCS model stellar atmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008), and line data from VALD\n(Piskunov et al. 1995; Kupka et al. 1999). In Fig. 3 we show the\nobserved line profiles and synthetic line profiles for the Balmer\nH\u03b1 line for these three stars, using both the spectroscopic temperatures (left-hand side plots) and the temperatures from microlensing techniques (right-hand side plots). We see that the\nsynthetic spectra based on spectroscopic temperatures reproduce\nthe wings of the H\u03b1 line almost perfectly, while the spectra based\n\non temperatures from microlensing techniques clearly do not\nmatch the observed wing profiles.\nWe could not find anything that was obviously wrong with\nthe photometry of MOA-2009-BLG259S and MOA-2009-BLG489S, although differential reddening is noticeable in the field of\nMOA-2009-BLG-489S (Nataf, private communication, see also\nTable 3). However, for MOA-2010-BLG-311S there was only\none highly-magnified V point, so the (V \u2212 I)0 colour could not be\nrobustly estimated by the standard techniques used by Yoo et al.\n(2004). In an alternative attempt to determine the (V \u2212 I)0 colour\nfor MOA-2010-BLG-311S we first determined the instrumental\n(I \u2212H) colour, making use of the H-band data that are simultaneously taken with I band on the SMARTS ANDICAM camera at\nthe 1.3 m CTIO telescope. We then converted from instrumental\n(I\u2212H) to (V\u2212I) by constructing a VIH colour-colour diagram for\nfield stars, which is analogous to the technique for optical colour\ntransformations (Gould et al. 2010). Now we find a colour of\n(V \u2212 I)0 = 0.75 for MOA-2010-BLG-311S, which is in good\nagreement with the \"spectroscopic\" value of 0.78. Note, however, that this method cannot be blindly applied to VIH transformations because (at the depth of the SMARTS H-band images)\nthe colour-colour diagram is constructed from giants and subgiants, while the transformation applies to dwarfs. Additionally,\nthere is a giant-dwarf bifurcation of the VIH colour-colour relations for (V \u2212 K)0 > 3 (Bessell & Brett 1988), which corresponds to (V \u2212 I)0 > 1.3 (see, in particular, Dong et al. 2006).\nNevertheless, since most microlensed dwarfs (including this\none), have bluer colours than this limit, the method can usually\nbe applied, if necessary.\nFor the 24 microlensed dwarf stars that have microlensing (V \u2212 I)0 colours, including the revised colour for MOA2010-BLG311S, we find that our spectroscopic temperatures are\n80 \u00b1 217 K lower than the ones based on the colour-[Fe/H]T eff relationships (see Fig. 5a). Note that the colours for the\nprevious microlensing events in Bensby et al. (2010c) were estimated under the assumption that the red clump in the bulge\nhas (V \u2212 I)0 = 1.05. Hence, those colours have been adjusted\n(by adding 0.03 mag) and new effective temperatures were determined. For clarity, all 26 events are listed in Table 3. The\nCasagrande et al. (2010) calibrations can also be used to see\nwhat (V \u2212 I)0 colours the spectroscopic effective temperatures\ncorrespond to. For the new stars these are listed in Table 3,\nand the comparison between photometric and \"spectroscopic\"\n(V \u2212 I)0 colours are shown in Fig. 5. On average the spectroscopic colours are in good agreement with the ones from microlensing techniques being only slightly lower (the difference\nis 0.02 \u00b1 0.07 mag, see Fig. 5b).\nThis difference is due to that we now use the calibrations\nby Casagrande et al. (2010), while we in Bensby et al. (2010c)\nused the ones by Ram\u0131\u0301rez & Mel\u00e9ndez (2005). If we were to\nuse the Ram\u0131\u0301rez & Mel\u00e9ndez (2005) calibrations the difference\nwould be 0.00 \u00b1 0.06 mag. This means that the (V \u2212 I)0 value\nfor the bulge red clump that was revised from 1.05 to 1.08 in\nBensby et al. (2010c) could be revised back again to 1.06.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. The metallicity distribution\n\nIn Fig. 6a we show the MDF for our sample of 26 dwarf stars\nin the bulge. Since the typical error in [Fe/H] is about 0.1 dex,\nwe choose a bin size for the histogram of 0.2 dex. This ensures\nthat any feature that we detect in the distribution is not due to\nerror statistics, i.e., features that could originate from the mea9\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\nFig. 6. a) MDF for our 26 microlensed dwarf stars in the bulge.\nb) MDF for 204 RGB stars in the bulge, from Zoccali et al.\n(2008). c) The significance for the failure of reproduce a gap\nvs. position of a gap in the dwarf star MDF (see explanation in\nSect. 4.1).\n\nsurement uncertainties are suppressed by the size of each bin. We\nnote that this MDF appears bimodal with peaks at [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.6\nand \u2248 +0.3 dex, and a gap of only two stars at [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.1. In\nFig. 6b, for comparison, we show the MDF for 204 RGB stars in\nthe bulge from Zoccali et al. (2008). Given that the MDF for the\nRGB stars only has one prominent peak (although asymmetric),\nthere is a significant difference between the RGB and the dwarf\nstar MDFs. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the two distributions yields a p-value of 0.11. Even though this is not low\nenough to reject the null-hypothesis that the MDFs are drawn\nfrom the same distribution, under the commonly used limit of\n0.05, it is low enough to warrant further investigation.\nThe most prominent difference is the deficiency of stars in\nthe dwarf star MDF, situated almost where the RGB MDF peaks.\nThe question we ask is: what is the probability of obtaining such\na deficiency, similar to the one in the dwarf star MDF, if 26 stars\nare drawn randomly from the RGB MDF? To answer this question, we construct a simple significance test. First, we draw 26\nstars randomly from the RGB MDF. Given that there are 204\nstars in the RGB sample, we assume the RGB MDF to be representative of the complete underlying MDF. Next, we check if\nthe sample of 26 randomly drawn stars has a deficiency of stars\nin the MDF at [Fe/H] = x. We define the deficiency of stars in\nthe MDF as a gap with two stars or less in a metallicity range\nof 0.3 dex (see Fig. 5a). The gap in Fig. 6 spans about 0.4 dex.\nHowever, given that the typical error in [Fe/H] for the dwarf stars\nis about 0.1 dex, we use a range of 0.3 dex. We iterate this process 105 times. We define the significance as the fraction of iterations that fail to reproduce a gap in the randomly generated\ndwarf star MDF. Finally, we sample over the position of the gap,\nx, from [Fe/H] = \u22122 to [Fe/H] = +1 in steps of 0.1 dex.\nFigure 5c shows our result from the test. As can be seen, the\nexistence of a gap of stars in the dwarf star MDF at [Fe/H] =\n10\n\nFig. 7. Top panel show ages versus [Fe/H] for the now in total 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the Bulge. Stars\nwith [Fe/H] > 0 are marked with black circles and stars with\n[Fe/H] < 0 with grey circles. Bottom panel shows age histograms for the metal-rich stars (hatched histogram) and metalpoor stars (grey histogram).\n\n\u22120.1 is unlikely. This indicates that the gap in the MDF is most\nlikely not caused by low number statistics. Additionally, we ran\nthe test with a gap range of 0.2 and 0.4 dex and found that it\ndid not affect the result significantly. Given the possibility of\nsystematic offsets in [Fe/H] for giants and dwarfs, how would a\nshift in the giant MDF affect the significance level as a function\nof [Fe/H]? As we sample over all [Fe/H] in the test above, the\nonly effect of shifting the giant MDF is a shift of the significance\ncurve in Fig. 6 by the same amount.\n4.2. Ages and metallicities\n\nFigure 7a shows the age-metallicity diagram for the 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. At sub-solar metallicities\nthe stars are predominantly old with ages between 9 and 13 Gyr\n(see Fig. 7b), and no apparent trend of increasing or decreasing\nages with [Fe/H] is seen. The average age and 1\u03c3 dispersion is\n11.0 \u00b1 2.9 Gyr. This is similar to what is found for thick disk\ndwarfs at the same metallicity in the solar neighbourhood (e.g.,\nFuhrmann 1998; Bensby et al. 2007).\nFurthermore, looking again at the metal-poor population, all\nstars, except MOA-2010-BLG-446S at [Fe/H] = \u22120.37, seem to\nhave the same age within the errorbars. If we exclude this star\nthe average age becomes 11.7 \u00b1 1.7 Gyr, indicating that the age\nspread in metal-poor population is indeed very small. Regarding\nMOA-2010-BLG-446S, we do not rule out the possibility that it\nis an interloper from the Galactic disk.\nThe stars at super-solar metallicities on the other hand show\na wide range of ages from the youngest disk, being only a few\nbillion years old, to the oldest halo, as old as the Universe (see\nFig. 7). The average age and 1\u03c3 dispersion is 7.6 \u00b1 3.9 Gyr for\nthe stars at super-solar [Fe/H].\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\nIf the ages are weighted by the inverse squares of their errors,\nthe average ages and 1\u03c3 dispersions become 5.9\u00b13.4 Gyr for the\nmetal-rich stars, and 11.7 \u00b1 1.5 for the metal-poor stars (9.5 \u00b1\n4.2 Gyr when including MOA-2010-BLG-446S).\n4.3. Absolute magnitudes\n\nIn order to further investigate whether our microlensed dwarf\nand subgiant stars are indeed in the Bulge, we have compared\nthe absolute I magnitudes obtained from the microlensing photometry with the absolute magnitudes obtained from the spectroscopic stellar parameters.\nThe spectroscopic absolute magnitudes were obtained with\nthe same methods and the same set of isochrones employed to\ndetermine the ages (see Sect. 3). The absolute magnitudes from\nthe microlensing technique, MI,\u03bclens , were obtained by comparing the instrumental I magnitude of the microlensing source,\nIinstr,s , with the instrumental I magnitude of the bulge red clump,\nIinstr,clump , assuming that the absolute magnitude of the clump is\nMI,clump = \u22120.15, i.e.\nMI,\u03bclens = Iinstr,s \u2212 Iinstr,clump \u2212 0.15\n\n(3)\n\nThis means that the MI,\u03bclens will exactly equal MI,\u03bcsource if:\n1. The instrumental clump centroid is correctly measured.\n[Clump centroids are probably accurate to about 0.1 mag.\nThis is the typical measured difference in the clump centroids of different data sets of the same field and then transformed from one to another.]\n2. The instrumental source magnitude is correctly measured.\n[In most cases this is extremely accurate (of order 0.02 mag\nor less).]\n3. The extinction towards the source is the same as the mean\nextinction towards the clump. [Most fields have modest differential extinction. There is very little systematic bias. The\nrandom error due to differential extinction is probably less\nthan 0.05 mag.]\n4. The absolute magnitude of the bulge clump is MI,clump =\n\u22120.15. [Note: MI,clump = \u22120.25 is the value that usually has\nbeen used in bulge microlensing studies. However, recent\nstudies indicate that it probably is incorrect, and should be\n\u22120.15 (D. Nataf, private communication).]\n5. The source is at the same distance as the clump. [The sources\nare certainly not at the same distance as the clump. They\nare thought to be in the bulge, and therefore at a range of\ndistances similar to the range of distances of clump stars.\nHowever, the sources must be behind the lenses. Thus, if\nthe latter are in the bulge (thought to be about 60% of lensing events) then the former must be preferentially towards\nthe back of the bulge. Hence, on these grounds alone one\nwould expect them to be of order 0.1 mag behind the clump.\nHowever, from Fig. 11 it is clear that the spectroscopic sample is drawn preferentially from positive longitudes, which\nconstitute the near side of the Galactic bar, which has a slope\nof roughly 0.1 mag deg\u22121. We take this as indicating a strong\nbias towards brighter sources (which then require less magnification to enter our sample). Of course, within any given\nline of sight, this bias is working on a much narrower baseline, i.e., the intrinsic dispersion in the bulge depth, which\nis order 0.15 mag. We therefore estimate that the two biases\napproximately cancel out, and that there is an intrinsic dispersion of source distances of 0.15 mag.]\nFigure 8 shows the difference between the absolute I magnitudes from the two methods versus stellar mass (as determined\n\nFig. 8. The difference between the absolute I magnitudes from\nmicrolensing techniques and from spectroscopy versus stellar\nmass (derived from spectroscopy). Error bars represent the uncertainties in the spectroscopic values.\nfrom spectroscopy). The spectroscopic values are on average\nhigher by \u22120.13 mag (with a dispersion of 0.56 mag). The error\nbars represent the uncertainties in the spectroscopic values. Even\nthough the individual points appears to be basically consistent at\nthe 1-\u03c3 level, there is a tentative trend in the sense that the spectroscopic values are higher for low masses while microlensing\nvalues are higher for high masses.\nTo formally evaluate the significance of the difference between the microlensing and spectroscopic estimates of MI , we\nfirst estimate an error of 0.2 mag in the microlensing MI values,\nwhich is the quadrature sum of the 5 enumerated error sources\nidentified above. We add this in quadrature to the (asymmetric)\nerrors shown in Fig. 8, and evaluate \u03c72 as a function of assumed\noffset. We find \u2206MI = \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.15, with \u03c72min = 12.48 for 21\ndegrees of freedom. The fact that the mean is within 1 \u03c3 of zero\nimplies that the sample is consistent with being entirely drawn\nfrom bulge stars. Since \u03c72 is less than the number of dof, there\nis no evidence for scatter beyond that due to measurement errors (which includes our estimate of a 0.15 mag dispersion in\ndistances relative to the clump). Of course, this does not prove\nthat all of our sources are in bulge: there could be disk interlopers. However, the fact that microlensing models place the\noverwhelming majority of lensed sources in the bulge, combined\nwith the demonstrated consistency between the MI determined\nfrom spectra and those determined from microlensing (based on\nthe assumption that they have the same mean distance as the\nbulge clump) strongly supports a bulge location for the great majority of our sources.\n4.4. Colour-magnitude diagram\n\nFigure 9 shows our stars in the HR diagram. We consider the\nmetal-poor and metal-rich stars separately, and we include dereddened colours and absolute magnitudes estimated directly\nfrom the spectra (filled circles, see Sect. 3.2) as well as from\nthe micro-lensing technique (open circles, see Sect. 3.3). The\ntwo values are connected for each star by a dotted line (note\nthat 4 stars do not have microlensing values, see Table 3). The\nmetal-poor stars (Fig 9a) are spread from the main-sequence to\nthe bottom of the red giant branch. The age of the population of\nthese stars is younger if we consider the magnitudes and colours\n11\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\nFig. 9. (a) and (b) show the (V \u2212 I)0 versus MI colour-magnitude\ndiagram using values from microlensing techniques (open circles) and spectroscopy (filled circles). (a) shows the stars\nwith [Fe/H] < 0 and (b) the stars with [Fe/H] > 0. Each\nCMD also show the Y2 isochrones (1, 5, 10, and 15 Gyr)\nfrom Demarque et al. (2004). For the metal-poor sample the\nisochrones have [Fe/H] = \u22120.6 and for the metal-rich sample\n[Fe/H] = +0.3. The spectroscopic and microlensing values have\nbeen connected with a dashed line for each star (4 stars do not\nhave microlensing values).\nderived by micro-lensing techniques (between 5 and 10 Gyr),\nwhile, if we use the spectroscopically determined colours and\nmagnitudes, the age is about 5 Gyr larger with a very nicely defined sub-giant branch. Regradless of these differences it is clear\nthat we are dealing with a population that is old.\nFor the metal-rich stars (Fig 9b) the situation is somewhat\ndifferent. Here we have no stars that have evolved sufficiently\nto trace the sub-giant branch. Additionally, the spectroscopy and\nmicro-lensing techniques yield rather similar results for almost\nall stars. The stars are clustered in the turn-off region and there\nseems to be both rather young stars (5 Gyr with very little room\nfor a large change) up to stars as old as 10 Gyr. There are quite\na few stars that potentially cluster around the 1 Gyr isochrone as\nwell.\nIn summary, when we consider the high and low metallicity\nstars as two stellar populations, and study their location in an HR\ndiagram, we see that the metal-poor population is fairly evolved\nand includes essentially older stars, whilst the metal-rich population is less evolved and tentatively includes some rather young\nstars.\n4.5. Abundance trends\n4.5.1. Similarities to the Galactic thick disk\n\nFrom the analysis of OGLE-2008-BLG-209S, which was the\nfirst microlensed subgiant star with a metallicity below solar,\nwe got the first hint from a chemically un-evolved star that\nthe metal-poor parts of the bulge might be similar to those of\nthe Galactic thick disk (Bensby et al. 2009b). In Bensby et al.\n(2010c) where the sample was expanded to 15 microlensed\ndwarf and subgiant stars, out of which 7 had [Fe/H] < 0, it\nwas clear that the metal-poor bulge, in terms of both elemental\nabundance ratios as well as stellar ages, is similar to the Galactic\nthick disk. With this study we add another five stars with subsolar metallicities, and another seven with super-solar metallicities. The updated abundance plots are shown in Fig. 10 and it\nis clear that the new stars further strengthens the similarity between the metal-poor bulge and the Galactic thick disk as seen in\n12\n\nthe solar neighbourhood. The agreement is almost perfect for all\nthe \u03b1-elements and only for the two s-process elements Ba and\nY are there some discrepancies, and then for only one or two\nstars at the lowest [Fe/H]. Given the error bars and the fact that\nit is only 1-2 stars, it is difficult to judge if the differences for\nBa and Y are real. We also note the large dispersion in [Zn/Fe]\nat high metallicities, which most likely is caused by the fact that\nthe Zn abundances for a majority of the stars are based on only\none spectral line.\nThe similarity between the bulge and the local thick disk\nabundance trends was actually first recognised from studies of\nK giants (Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2008) and later by Alves-Brito et al.\n(2010) and Gonzalez et al. (2011). Recently it has been shown\nthat this similarity also holds when comparing bulge giant stars\nwith K giant stars from the thick disk in the inner parts of the\nGalaxy (Bensby et al. 2010a).\n4.5.2. Rapid enrichment and time scale for SNIa in the bulge\n\nThe high level of \u03b1-element abundances relative to Fe are signatures of rapid star formation where massive stars, which have\nshort lifetimes, are the main contributors of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium when they explode as core collapse SNe produce and expel large amounts of \u03b1-elements (see,\ne.g., Ballero et al. 2007b). This will result in high [\u03b1/Fe] ratios\nat low [Fe/H], and we see this for the microlensed dwarf stars\nat [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.4. Once low- and intermediate-mass stars starts\nto play a significant r\u00f4le in the chemical enrichment, through\nthe explosions of SNIa, which produce relatively little of the \u03b1elements, there will be a downturn (knee) in the [\u03b1/Fe]\u2013[Fe/H]\nabundance plot. This is what we see for the microlensed bulge\ndwarfs at [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.4. This means that the star formation\nin the bulge continued for at least as long as it takes for the\nSNIa to contribute significantly to the build-up of elements.\nEstimates of the SNIa time scale depends on the type of environment and ranges from a few hundred million years to 1-2\nbillion years (e.g., Matteucci & Recchi 2001). In Fig. 7 we see\nthat the bulge dwarfs with sub-solar [Fe/H] predominantly have\nages around 10 Gyr, and the lack of an age-metallicity relation\nfor the metal-poor dwarfs (Sect. 4.2) could indicate that SNIa\nstarted to contribute to the chemical enrichment soon after star\nformation started in the bulge. Even though the internal measurement errors in the old stars of the sample is still quite large\nto be constraining timescales of 100 Myr versus 1 Gyr, this could\nmean that the timescale for SNIa in the bulge was short. If not,\nthe stars with [Fe/H] just above the knee would have been significantly younger than those on the plateau, but they are not. A\nshort time-scale of a few hundred million years for SNIa is found\nfor elliptical galaxies while the time-scale in the disks of spiral\ngalaxies are a few billion years (e.g., Matteucci & Recchi 2001).\nGiven the similarities we see between the metal-poor bulge and\nthe thick disk it is worthwhile to mention that the thick disk in\nthe solar neighbourhood shows a possible age-metallicity relation (Bensby et al. 2004a; Haywood 2006; Bensby et al. 2007),\nwith the stars that are more metal-rich than the knee having ages\nthat are 1 to 2 Gyr younger than those more metal-poor than the\nposition of the knee. Now, we have only 1-2 microlensed dwarf\nstars with \u22120.4 . [Fe/H] . 0, and it might well be, once we\nhave a larger sample, that those stars turn out to be, on average,\nyounger than the more metal-poor ones. Also note that there is\na possibility that the lack of an age-metallicity relation could be\ndue to a lot of mixing (either caused by the bar, or caused by the\nmerging of sub-clumps). Such mechanisms have been proposed\nto be responsible for both the observed age-velocity relation and\n\n\fT.

IV.\n\nthe absence of age-metallicity relation in the solar neighbourhood (e.g., Minchev & Famaey 2010).\n4.5.3. The metal-rich bulge\n\nRegarding the metal-rich bulge, most stars seem to follow the\ntrends as outlined by the thin disk as seen in the solar neighbourhood. However, there are two stars that have elevated abundance\nratios that stand out: MOA-2010-BLG-523S at [Fe/H] = +0.09\nand MOA-2010-BLG-259S at [Fe/H] = +0.37. From Table 2 we\nsee that these are two of the more evolved stars in the sample. In\norder to investigate whether the unusually high Na abundances\nin MOA-2010-BLG-523S and MOA-2009-BLG-259S for their\nmetallicities could be due to the assumption of LTE, we have\nperformed 1D non-LTE calculations following Lind et al. (2011)\nfor the four employed Na i lines. We find that while the non-LTE\neffects are significant (\u22120.1 dex) they are essentially the same in\nall our targets as well as in the Sun, leaving our derived LTEbased [Na/Fe] ratios unaffected. Non-LTE can thus not explain\nthe atypical Na abundances of these two stars. Another possibility could be that the stellar parameters for these stars are erroneous. In order to bring down the [Na/Fe] ratio from +0.19\nto zero for MOA-2010-BLG-523S, and to bring down [Na/Fe]\nratio from +0.4 to +0.2 for MOA-2009-BLG-259S, we need to\nincrease the effective temperatures with more than 500 K or increase the surface gravities by \u223c 1 dex. As the current temperatures of 5250 K and 4953 K well reproduce the wing profiles\nof their H\u03b1 lines, it is unlikely that erroneous effective temperatures are responsible for the high abundance ratios that we see\nfor some elements in this star. Also, both of these stars have more\nthan 10 Fe ii lines measured and the Fe i-Fe ii ionisation balances\nare well constrained, making a shift of 1 dex in surface gravity\nunlikely. For now we have to accept the fact that these two stars\nshow elevated levels for some elements that does not agree with\nthe other microlensed bulge dwarf stars at similar [Fe/H].\nNotable is that the uprising trends of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H] at\nvery high metallicities that are seen for the disk stars for many\nelements, e.g., [Na/Fe], [Al/Fe], and in particular the iron-peak\nelement [Ni/Fe], is also present in the microlensed bulge dwarfs\n(see Fig. 10).\nWe furthermore note that some of the characteristics of\nMOA-2009-BLG-259S and MOA-2010-BLG-523S (high Na\nand Al) seem typical of second generation globular cluster stars (e.g., Carretta et al. 2009). Stars resembling globular\ncluster second generation stars have been found in the halo\n(Martell & Grebel 2010) and their eventual presence in the bulge\nmight gauge the role that globular clusters had, through losing stars and/or disintegrating in the formation of the bulge.\nHowever, Martell & Grebel (2010) have not analysed O, Na,\nMg, and Al, so it is still to be proved whether their sample indeed originated from globular clusters. Also, a connection with\nthe globular cluster O-Na anti-correlation for MOA-2009-BLG259S and MOA-2010-BLG-523S is unlikely given that their O,\nNa, Al, and Mg abundances are all high (and several other elements too for one of the two stars).\n4.6. Positions and radial velocities\n\nFigure 11a shows the positions on the sky for the full sample\nof microlensed dwarf stars in the bulge. They are all located\nbetween galactic latitudes \u22122\u25e6 to \u22125\u25e6 , similar to Baade's window at (l, b) = (1\u25e6 , \u22124\u25e6). The reason why most stars are located\nat positive galactic longitudes and negative latitudes is related\n14\n\nFig. 11. Positions, radial velocities, and metallicities for the now\nin total 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. Grey circles\nmark stars that have [Fe/H] < 0 and black circles those that\nhave [Fe/H] > 0. The curved line in (a) shows the outline of the\nsouthern Bulge based on observations with the COBE satellite\n(Weiland et al. 1994), and the concentric dotted lines show the\nangular distance from the Galactic centre in 1\u25e6 intervals.\n\nto the extinction / geometry of the bulge. As shown in, e.g.,\nKerins et al. (2009), the optical depth, based on stars, is higher\nin these regions and therefore the chances for microlensing to\noccur is higher here. Also, MOA and OGLE have so far mainly\nsurveyed the bulge at negative latitudes as these are regions of\nlower extinction.\nWe find that there is essentially no difference in the velocity distributions between the metal-poor and metal-rich samples (see Fig. 11b). The average velocities are almost identical,\n21.9 \u00b1 98.7 and 19.7 \u00b1 109.0 km s\u22121 for the two samples. The\nhigh velocity dispersion is typical for what has been seen in large\nsurveys of the bulge, for instance the BRAVA survey, which observed and determined radial velocities for several thousand giants (Howard et al. 2008). They found velocity dispersions ranging between 80 \u2212 120 km s\u22121 at these galactic longitudes.\n4.7. Lithium abundances in the bulge\n\nAs we reported in Bensby et al. (2010b), MOA-2010-BLG-285S\nis the first metal-poor dwarf star for which Li has been clearly\ndetected in the Galactic bulge. It has a Li abundance which is\nfully consistent with what is seen in other metal-poor dwarf\nstars in the Galactic disk and halo at this effective temperature\nand metallicity (e.g., Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2010). Figure 12a shows\nthat the star lies on the metal-rich end of the Li Spite plateau\n(Spite & Spite 1982). Combined with its old age, MOA-2010BLG-285S is an excellent confirmation that the bulge did not\nundergo a large amount of Li production or astration in its earliest phases.\nThe Li abundances in the other five more metal-rich dwarf\nstars, in which it could be measured, show a wide range,\n\n\fT.

(2010c) we explored in detail whether the microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars are located in the Bulge region, or in the disk on either this side or the far side of the Bulge.\nWe concluded then that the combination of kinematics, colourmagnitude diagrams and microlensing statistics makes it highly\nlikely that the microlensed dwarfs that we are studying are members of a stellar population that belong in the Bulge. In this study\nwe have further investigated the bulge membership of the microlensed bulge dwarfs. In Sect. 4.3 we determined the absolute\nmagnitudes of the microlensed dwarfs and compared them to\nthose that can be determined from microlensing techniques. We\nfind that the two are in agreement at better than our 1\u03c3 measurement error of 0.15 mag. This is consistent with the expectation\n(based on Galactic microlensing models) that the overwhelming\nmajority of microlensed sources towards these lines of sight are\nin the bulge.\n5.2. Baade's window not representative?\n\nFig. 12. (a) Li abundance versus [Fe/H], and (b) versus T eff .\nThe large circles indicate the microlensed bulge dwarfs listed\nin Table 6. The ages of the stars have been coded by the sizes of\nthe circles as indicated in (a). Comparison data (small blue dots)\ncome from Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2010), Lambert & Reddy (2004),\nand Ghezzi et al. (2010a,b).\n\nmost of them significantly lower than the Li Spite plateau.\nMOA-2008-BLG-311S, which has a higher temperature (T eff =\n5944 K) than the other metal-rich stars, is the one with the\nhighest Li abundance. Most likely, the Li in these metal-rich\nstars represent abundances that were obtained by depletion during their main-sequence lifetimes from higher initial values.\nObservations of intermediate-age solar-metallicity stars both in\nclusters such as M67 (e.g., Jones et al. 1999) and in the field\n(e.g., Baumann et al. 2010) show that they have a large range of\nLi values, which can be explained by a range of ages, masses,\nand initial rotation values.\nThe only other detections of Li in the Galactic bulge are\nfrom observations of RGB and AGB stars (e.g., Gonzalez et al.\n2009) in which the atmospheric Li abundance have been altered.\nDwarf and subgiant stars with effective temperatures greater\nthan about 5900 K are the only reliable tracers of Li (e.g.,\nWeymann & Sears 1965; Boesgaard & Tripicco 1986).\n\n5. Why are the dwarf and giant MDFs different?\nThe MDF is a key observable used to constrain chemical evolution models (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997; Kobayashi et al. 2006).\nTherefore it is important to discuss in detail the differences in\nthe MDFs of dwarf and giant stars in the bulge. If the gap in the\ndwarf MDF is real and if the bulge MDF truly is bimodal, why\n\nCould it be that the region towards Baade's window is not representative for the Bulge, not even other close-by regions, and\nthat this is the reason for the discrepant MDFs from the RGB\nand microlensed dwarf star samples? Zoccali et al. (2008) find\ndifferent MDFs in their fields (b = \u22124\u25e6 , \u22126\u25e6 , and \u221212\u25e6 ) and\nclaim that there is a vertical metallicity gradient in the bulge.\nThe Zoccali et al. (2008) RGB comparison sample is located in\nBaade's window, which indeed is a very small region of the\nGalactic bulge. The 26 microlensed dwarf stars have a wider\nspread in l and b. However, their average distance from the\nGalactic centre coincides very well with Baade's window (see\nFig. 11). Also Brown et al. (2010) used WFC3 photometry and\ntwo-colour plots to derive MDFs for 4 fields in the bulge including some close to the Galactic plane (b = \u22122.15\u25e6, \u22122.65\u25e6,\n\u22123.81\u25e6, and \u22124.72\u25e6). They found that K-S tests ruled out the possibility that they were drawn from the same distribution. They\nwere working in reddening-free measurements, and while not\nas good as spectroscopy, obviously, it is a possible confirmation\nof MDF variations across the bulge. Interesting, some of their\nMDFs look quite metal-rich (though they had issues concerning\ntheir zero-point) and more double-peaked.\n5.3. Strong gradients in the bulge?\n\nThe RGB comparison sample in Baade's window from\nZoccali et al. (2008) is located 4\u25e6 from the Galactic plane as well\nas from the Galactic centre, while our microlensed dwarf stars\nrange 2\u25e6 -5\u25e6 from the Galactic plane and 2\u25e6 -6\u25e6 from the Galactic\ncentre (see Fig. 11). Would it be possible that there are gradients\npresent in the metal-rich bulge population that are not picked up\nby the RGB sample in Baade's window? Possibilities include:\n\u2013 There are two co-existing bulge populations - one metal-poor\nand one metal-rich. However, there is a very steep spatial\nabundance gradient in what we pick up as the metal-rich\ndwarf population, and at the distance of Baade's window the\n[Fe/H] is much lower than close to the plane or close to the\nGalactic centre. Hence, the metal-rich stars can not be seen\nin the RGB sample from Baade's window.\n15\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\n\u2013 There is a number density gradient in the metal-rich population, meaning that at the distance of Baade's window the\nnumber of very metal-rich stars has dropped and is very low.\nHence, the metal-rich population is missing in the RGB sample.\nBabusiaux et al. (2010) use the Zoccali et al. (2008) data and\nthey find a metal-rich and a metal-poor population. They mention that the metal-rich group seems to drop out as they move\naway from Baade's window, perhaps supporting the second possibility wherein the number density of metal-rich stars drops\nquickly. From the same stellar sample Gonzalez et al. (2011)\nshow that these two populations separate also in their [\u03b1/Fe]\nratios. However, the fields they are considering are located at\nb = \u22124\u25e6 , \u22126\u25e6 , and \u221212\u25e6 , is a significantly larger range than that\ncovered by the microlensed dwarf stars (b = \u22122\u25e6 , to \u22126\u25e6 , see\nFig. 11) within which the effect should be less dramatic. We also\nnote the claim by Rich et al. (2007), which is based on IR spectroscopy, that there is no metallicity gradient in the inner bulge\n(|b| < 4\u25e6 ).\n5.4. Uncertainties in the analysis?\n\nThe analysis of giants is more difficult than that of dwarf stars.\nThis is because blending is severe for giants, caused by their\nlower effective temperatures, which will result in spectra with\nstronger lines from neutral elements and a lot of molecular lines.\nThe blending will become even more severe for metal-rich stars,\nwhich could be the reason for spuriously high abundance ratios in some studies (see, e.g., Lecureur et al. 2007). Regarding\nproblems in the analysis of solar-metallicity giants, Santos et al.\n(2009) reported that their standard analysis of giant stars in open\nclusters results in a much narrower metallicity distribution (with\na total spread between different clusters of only about 0.1 dex)\nthan that obtained using dwarf stars, which show that there is\na cluster-to-cluster spread in metallicity about 2.5 times higher\nthan that found using giants. The problem seems to be related to\nblends by atomic and molecular lines, as the use of the line list by\nHekker & Mel\u00e9ndez (2007), which has been checked for blends,\nresults in a total metallicity spread derived from open cluster giants similar to that derived from dwarfs (Fig. 1 in Santos et al.\n2009). Thus, standard analysis of giant stars may result in a compression of the MDF for metallicities around solar or higher, perhaps erasing the metallicity gap we have found in the MDF of\nthe bulge.\nThe RGB star spectra of Zoccali et al. (2008) have a resolution of R \u223c 20000, whilst our microlensed dwarf stars are\nobserved with R \u223c 40000 to 60 000. That blending might be\na problem in metal-rich giants can be seen in Fig. 13a which\nshows how the line-to-line dispersion of the Fe abundances for\nthe Zoccali et al. (2008) RGB sample in Baade's window vary\nwith [Fe/H], reaching dispersions of 0.5 dex, and in some cases\neven higher.\nTo better account for the large dispersions seen in the RGB\nsample we have in Figure 13c constructed an alternative MDF\nfor the RGB sample. Instead of plotting a standard histogram,\neach star is represented by a normalised Gaussian, defined by\nthe specific mean value and error in [Fe/H] for each star. It would\nhave been be good if we had error estimates similar to the ones\nthat were calculated in Sect. 3 for the microlensed dwarfs, but the\nonly information we have from Zoccali et al. (2008) is the lineto-line dispersion for each of the 204 stars in Baade's window\nand that in average 60-70 Fe i lines have been used to determine\nthe stellar parameters and [Fe/H]. However, Bensby et al. (in\n16\n\nprep.) have performed an error analysis following Epstein et al.\n(2010) for 703 F and G stars (dwarfs, subgiants, and a handful of low-luminosity giants.). It is found that the calculated errors in [Fe/H] correlate with the line-to-line dispersion of the\nFe i abundances. As the analysis of a majority of the 703 stars\nhave used many more Fe i lines than the 60-70 that Zoccali et al.\n(2008) have used, we select a subsample of \u223c 100 stars from\nthe 703 stars that have 100 or less Fe i lines measured and used\nin the analysis. We then perform a simple linear regression between the line-to-line dispersion and the error in [Fe/H] for those\nstars. This regression line has a constant of 0.044 and a slope of\n0.50, allowing us to transform the line-to-line dispersions into\nestimated errors in [Fe/H] for the 204 RGB stars. This plot is\nshown in Fig. 13b. It should be cautioned that the spectra used\nby Zoccali et al. (2008) have lower resolutions and lower S /N\nthan the spectra used by Bensby et al. (in prep.), and that the\nstellar parameter determination methodology is different (gravity is not a spectroscopically tuned parameter in Zoccali et al.\n2008). Additionaly, and most important, the Zoccali et al. (2008)\nsample consists of giants while the Bensby et al. (in prep.) have\nanalysed dwarf and subgiant stars. However, it is likely that the\nstellar parameters are less well determined when the line-to-line\nscatter is higher.\nThe total MDF curve shown in Fig. 13c is then the sum of\nthe Gaussians for all 204 RGB stars, normalised to unit area. It\nis interesting to see how the large uncertainties smears the MDF,\nand especially, now showing a less steep drop-off at the metalrich end. The question now is what happens if the same type\nof uncertainties are added to the sample of microlensed dwarf\nstars? Can it amount for an erasure of the gap such that the dwarf\nMDF resembles the RGB MDF?\nAssigning each star in the microlensed dwarf sample an uncertainty given by the dashed line in Fig. 13b, we then construct a\nnormalised gaussian for each of the 26 microlensed dwarf stars.\nThese are merged to form a new MDF for the microlensed dwarf\nsample, and is shown in Fig. 13d. Although the double-peak still\nis present, it is clear that it has been smeared out. However, the\ndouble-peak remains. Hence, we can not blame uncertainties in\nthe giant analysis to be the sole source for the discrepant MDFs,\nunless the error consists in a compression of the [Fe/H] values\n(see discussion earlier).\n5.5. Disk contamination in RGB sample?\n\nA certain degree of contamination in the RGB sample in Baade's\nwindow is expected. Based on the Besan\u00e7on model of the Galaxy\n(Robin et al. 2003), Zoccali et al. (2008) estimated a contamination of 10 \u2212 15 % in their RGB sample in Baade's window, divided more or less equally between foreground thin disk stars,\nlocated 2 \u2212 5 kpc from the Sun, and thick disk stars located\nwithin the bulge. The estimation of the thick disk contamination\nis based on the assumption in the Besan\u00e7on model that the thick\ndisk follows an exponential radial distribution that peaks in the\nGalactic centre. As also stated in Zoccali et al. (2008), these contaminations are poorly determined as we know very little about\nthe stellar populations in the inner Galactic disk, and essentially\nnothing about possible thin and thick disk stellar populations\nwithin the bulge. We therefore find it worthwhile to investigate\nhow much contamination is actually needed for the microlensed\ndwarf MDF and the Baade's window RGB MDF to agree.\nThe bulge has a radius of about 1.5 kpc (Rattenbury et al.\n2007), meaning that the foreground disk stars, if they are located\nin front of the Bulge, should be located, at most, approximately\n6 kpc from the Sun. Baade's window is located at b = \u22124\u25e6 , which\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\nFig. 13.

Dashed red line represents the running median (extrapolated outside the\ndata limits); (c) The MDF for the 204 RGB stars. The blue line is a smoothed version where each star is represented by a Gaussian\nhaving with a width equal to the estimated random error as shown in (b); (d) The MDF for the microlensed dwarf stars. The blue line\nis a smoothed version where each star is represented by a Gaussian with a width as given by the dashed line in (b); (e) shows how\nthe sum of the minimum residual between a joint disk GCS and microlensed dwarf MDF and the RGB MDF vary with the shift of\nthe GCS disk sample. For each value, the fraction of the GCS disk MDF is shown. The minimum sum of residuals is reached when\nthe disk GCS MDF is shifted +0.075 dex, and when the fraction of GCS disk MDF is 57 %. The MDFs and the smeared MDFs for\nthe RGB sample in Baade's window (f) The smoothed MDFs for the RGB sample (red dash-dotted line), the microlensed dwarf\nsample (green long-dashed line), the GCS2011 disk sample (olive coloured short-dashed line). The solid blue line shows the mix of\nthe MDFs from the GCS2011 disk sample and the microlensed dwarf sample that best match the RGB MDF. All MDFs have been\nnormalised to unit area (hence N on the ordinates are arbitrary numbers).\nat this distance from the Sun translates into a vertical distance of\n\u223c 400 pc. Assuming that the inner disk contains both a thin and\na thick disk (see first results in Bensby et al. 2010a), and that\nthey have similar scale heights as in the solar neighbourhood,\nthis is a distance from the plane where the thin disk is dominating. Hence, it is likely that if the giant sample is contaminated\nwith foreground stars, it should presumably be by thin disk stars.\nAssigning each star an uncertainty in [Fe/H] given by the\ndashed curve in Fig. 13b, we create two normalised MDFs: one\nfor the bulge (green dashed curve in Fig. 13f.) and one for the\ndisk (olive coloured dashed curve in Fig. 13f.). The normalised\nbulge MDF is based on the 26 microlensed dwarf stars, and the\nnormalised disk MDF on the disk stars from the re-calibration\nof the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey by (Casagrande et al. 2011,\nhereafter GCS2011). In the solar neighbourhood the disk MDF\npeaks slightly below solar (e.g., Casagrande et al. 2011). As the\nGalactic disk is likely to exhibit a shallow metallicity gradient (e.g., Maciel & Costa 2010; Cescutti et al. 2007, and references therein) the disk closer to the bulge would therefore have\na slightly higher average metallicity. We will therefore leave the\nshift of the GCS2011 MDF as a free parameter.\nWe then construct a joint MDF from the smeared out dwarf\nstar MDF and the smeared out GCS2011 disk MDF, with varying fractions of the two (from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1). Then we\ncompare this mixed MDF with the Baade window RGB MDF\n(as given in Fig. 13a) and determine for which mixture the sum\n\nof the residuals is minimised. This procedure is done for several different metallicity shifts of the GCS2011 disk MDF. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 13e which shows how the minimum\nsum of the residuals changes with the degree of contamination\nfor eleven different shifts of the GCS2011 MDF. The lowest values are achieved for a shift of approximately +0.075 dex of the\nGCS2011 MDF and a mix of 57 % GCS2011 and 43 % dwarf\nMDF. As can be seen in Fig. 13f, the mixed bulge-disk MDF\nand the RGB MDF are similar and agree quite well. Note that\nthe exact shift of the GCS2011 disk MDF seems to be of little\nimportance. All shifts suggest a disk contamination fraction of\n50 to 60 %.\nIs such a high foreground contamination of the RGB sample\nrealistic? If 50 to 60% of the bulge RGB samples are actually\nforeground disk stars, this might be visible in the kinematics of\nthe RGB sample. However, the velocity dispersion (\u03c3vr ) is similar in the RGB sample and in the microlensed dwarf sample.\nAlso stars with disk kinematics would introduce a metallicitydependent bias in the RGB sample, since the foreground contamination only is significant near solar metallicity (between\n[Fe/H] of \u22120.3 and +0.1). However, Babusiaux et al. (2010)\nfound no sign of disk kinematics within that metallicity range.\nFurthermore, the BRAVA survey RGB stars should also presumably be contaminated by foreground disk stars. However, there\nis good agreement between the vr distribution of the microlensed\ndwarfs and that of the BRAVA giants.\n17\n\n\fT.

(2010) a peculiar relation between maximum\nmagnification (Amax ) and [Fe/H] was discovered. Using 16 microlensing events available at that time it was demonstrated\nthat a very strong correlation between metallicity and maximum\nmagnification existed. Several possible explanations were given,\nbut all had to be rejected, leaving the puzzle unsolved. Now, with\nadditional data points in hand, we again look at this issue. As can\nbe seen in Fig. 14 it is evident that most of the events with the\nhighest magnifications have super-solar metallicities, and that\nlower magnification events dominate at sub-solar metallicities.\nHowever, the new data points (grey circles) appears to weaken\nthe relation as we now have high-magnification events at low\nmetallicities and low-magnification events at high metallicities,\ncombinations that were not present in Cohen et al. (2010). A\nSpearman rank test between [Fe/H] and Amax now gives a correlation of 0.42 and a significance that it deviates from zero of\n0.033. A Spearman correlation of zero indicates that there is no\ntendency for [Fe/H] to either increase or decrease when Amax increases. This means that we can not rule out the null hypothesis\nthat the two properties are uncorrelated. So, even though there is\nstill a statistical significance that the two parameters are correlated, it is weaker than in Cohen et al. (2010) who found a significance of 0.005, i.e. strongly correlated. More microlensing\nevents are needed in order to resolve whether the Amax puzzle is\nreal or not.\nIn any case, assuming that it is real \u2013 how would that affect the microlensed dwarf star MDF? Since all stars observed\nso far, without exception, has turned out to be either metal-poor\nor metal-rich, the only effect would probably be that the relative sizes of the two peaks change. The most likely scenario is\nthat we are missing more low-magnification events than highmagnification events. If so, that would mean that the metalpoor peak is under-estimated. The gap around solar metallicities would probably persist. To investigate what the effects might\nbe on the results regarding a possible foreground contamination\nof the RGB sample, we repeat the analysis shown in Fig. 13f\nwith two times as many stars in the metal-poor peak of the microlensed dwarf stars MDF. This results in that the best fit is now\nfound for a mix of 65 % disk stars from GCS2011 (now shifted\n0.125 dex) and 35 % microlensed dwarf stars. Thus, if the Amax\n\u2013 [Fe/H] puzzle is real, and should be accounted for, the possible foreground contamination of the RGB sample could be even\nhigher.\n18\n\nIn summary, we find no definitive answer to why the bulge MDF\nlook different depending on if it is based on RGB stars or microlensed dwarf stars. Abundance analysis of dwarf stars is certainly coupled to smaller errors and uncertainties than that of giant stars. Also, the resolution and S /N of the microlensed dwarf\nstar spectra are higher than for the RGB stars in Baade's window.\nFurthermore, statistics show that the microlensed dwarf stars are\nhighly likely to be located in the Bulge region. However, our\nestimate of the foreground disk contamination is at least four\ntimes as high as what the Besan\u00e7on model used by Zoccali et al.\n(2008) predicts, and is hard to digest. Given that the knowledge\nof the inner disk is very poor, and also the fact that the reddening is uncertain and often very patchy, it is clear that it is very\ndifficult to get a handle on the disk contamination in the RGB\nsample.\n\n6. The origin of the bulge\nFrom our studies of 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars we\nfind that the bulge MDF is bimodal, and Table 7 summarises the\nproperties of the two sub-populations. The metal-poor sample\nhas an average metallicity of [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.60 \u00b1 0.30, which is\nin perfect agreement with the mean metallicity that is found for\nthick disk stars at the solar circle ([Fe/H] = \u22120.6, Carollo et al.\n2010). The metal-rich sample shows a very high-metallicity, and\nnarrow, MDF peaking at [Fe/H] = +0.32 \u00b1 0.16. The metallicity dispersion in the metal-poor sample is twice the dispersion in\nthe metal-rich one. For the metal-poor bulge we find that almost\nall stars are old with ages in the range 9-13 Gyr, while the stars\nof the metal-rich population have ages that span from the oldest\nstars of the Galactic halo (> 12 Gyr) to the youngest stars of the\nGalactic disk. These age and metallicity differences indicate that\nthe bulge consists of two distinct stellar populations; the metalpoor bulge and the metal-rich bulge, respectively. Furthermore\nwe find that the abundance trends of the metal-poor bulge is\nsimilar to those of the Galactic thick disk as seen in the solar\nneighbourhood, i.e., enriched [\u03b1/Fe] ratios signalling a formation on short time-scales. The presence of a \"knee\" in the [\u03b1/Fe]\nabundance plot, coupled with the lack of an age-metallicity relation, could favour a short time-scale for SN Ia in the bulge.\nThe similarity between the metal-poor bulge and nearby thick\ndisk abundance trends are also seen in studies of giant stars\n(e.g., Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2008; Alves-Brito et al. 2010; Ryde et al.\n2010) and now this similarity has also been seen between bulge\ngiants and inner Galactic disk giants, 3 to 5 kpc from the Sun\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\n(Bensby et al. 2010a, 2011). The abundance trends of the metalrich population partly resemble those of the thin disk in the solar\nneighbourhood. We see no difference in the radial velocity distributions of the two populations, both show the same high velocity\ndispersions that is expected for a bulge population (Howard et al.\n2009).\n\nThe observational constraints above points to that the Milky\nWay has a bulge with a complex composition of stellar populations. The similarities between the metal-poor bulge and\nthe thick disk suggest that they might be tightly connected.\nPossible scenarios could be that the metal-poor bulge formed\nfrom an old Galactic disk (secular evolution, evidence for secular origins of bulges have been seen in many external galaxies,\ne.g., Genzel et al. 2008), that the metal-poor bulge and the old\ndisk formed simultaneously (but separately), or that the metalpoor bulge and the thick disk are indeed the same population.\nSimulations have also shown that it is possible for thick disks\nand bulges to form together by rapid internal evolution in unstable, gas-rich, and clumpy disks (Bournaud et al. 2009), which\nfurther could explain the similarities between the Galactic bulge\nand the thick disk. Furthermore, from a differential analysis of\nK giants at Galactocentric radii 4, 8, and 12 kpc, Bensby et al.\n(2011) found that it is likely that the scale-length of the thick disk\nis shorter than that of the thin disk. This has consequences for\nthe relative fractions of thin and thick disk stars in the Galactic\nplane, implying that in the bulge region the two disks should\nbe equally present at low galactic latitudes. Interestingly, the\n26 microlensed bulge stars divide about equally into being either metal-poor or metal-rich (see Fig. 6). Could this mean that\nwhat we are seeing is a bulge solely made up of thin and thick\ndisk stars, and that the metal-rich peak in the microlensed bulge\ndwarf MDF is a manifestation of the inner thin disk? The thin\ndisk is known to show a strong metallicity gradient (see, e.g.,\nCescutti et al. 2007), and if interpolated (linearly) to the bulge\nregion it would reach [Fe/H] > +0.5. A linear relationship all the\nway to the bulge is unlikely, but the strong gradient indicates that\nthe average metallicity could end up at, or around, the metalliicty that we see for the metal-rich peak of the microlensed dwarf\nMDF ([Fe/H] \u2248 +0.3). The lack of a radial gradient in the thick\ndisk could be explained through radial migration that has had\ntime to wash out abundance gradients in this old population. For\nthe much younger thin disk, radial migration has not had enough\ntime to act, and a radial metallicity gradient is still present. These\nfindings could support the results from the BRAVA survey which\nclaim that there is no evidence of a classical bulge (Shen et al.\n2010), but that the Milky Way is a pure-disk galaxy. The formation of the bulge from a two-component stellar disk has recently\nbeen modelled by Bekki & Tsujimoto (2011). We note that also\nBabusiaux et al. (2010) find evidence for two bulge populations.\nTheir results are based on the metallicities from Zoccali et al.\n(2008), now complemented with kinematics, and they find that\nthe metallicity gradient along the bulge minor axis observed by\nZoccali et al. (2008) can be related to a varying mix a metal-rich\npopulation with average metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.13 that has\nbar-like kinematics and a metal-poor population with average\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = \u22120.3 that has thick disk-like kinematics.\nRegarding the metal-rich bulge we find a wide range of stellar\nages. As also discussed in Babusiaux et al. (2010), this is consistent with a stellar population with old stars from the inner\ndisk that have been re-distributed by the central bar, and whose\nyoung stars have formed in star bursts triggered by the central\nbar.\n\n7. Implications for the bulge IMF\nThe MDFs based on the microlensed bulge dwarfs and on red\ngiants in Baades window are clearly different. This has important consequences for chemical evolution models, as the MDF\nstrictly constrains which kind of models are plausible. In particular, the peak of the MDF depends on the slope of the initial\nmass function (IMF). The chemical evolution model of the bulge\nby Ballero et al. (2007b) is based on the photometric MDF of giant stars by Zoccali et al. (2003) and on the spectroscopic MDF\nof giant stars by Fulbright et al. (2006). Ballero et al. (2007b)\nsuggested for the bulge an IMF much flatter than in the solar\nneighbourhood, i.e., an IMF skewed towards high mass stars,\nto explain the MDF of bulge giants by Zoccali et al. (2003) and\nFulbright et al. (2006).\nA more recent model by Cescutti & Matteucci (2011), using now the spectroscopic MDF of giant stars by Zoccali et al.\n(2008), also favours a flat IMF to reproduce the peak of the MDF\nof bulge giants. However, those conclusions may have to be revised in view of our new MDF based on microlensed dwarf stars.\nOur MDF has two well-defined peaks, one that we associate with\na metal-poor old bulge, and another one at super-solar metallicities associated with a younger population. Hence, the IMF no\nlonger has to be flat to explain a single peaked solar metallicity\nMDF that was made in 0.5 Gyr, as in the Cescutti & Matteucci\n(2011) models. To reproduce the bimodal nature of the bulge\nMDF, probably a normal IMF can be used for the metal-poor\nbulge, while contributions from Type Ia SN can probably explain the younger metal-rich peak.\nNotice that our MDF is still poorly sampled (only about two\ndwarfs per metallicity bin), thus, in order to provide even firmer\nconstraints on chemical evolution models, it is important to at\nleast double the sample of microlensed bulge stars observed at\nhigh resolution and high S /N. This will provide tight constraints\non our galactic bulge, and on a broader context will also have\nimportant consequences on the modelling of external galaxies\n(e.g., Ballero et al. 2007a)\n\n8. Summary\nWith the twelve events presented in this study the sample size of\nmicrolensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge has\ngrown to 26. All stars have been observed with high-resolution\nspectrographs on 8-10 m class telescopes, which has allowed us\nto determine detailed elemental abundances for many elements.\nThe following results and conclusions can be drawn with the\ncurrent sample.\n1. The MDF based on the microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars\nis bimodal with one peak at [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.6, one peak at\n[Fe/H] \u2248 +0.3, and with essentially no stars around solar\n[Fe/H]. This is in stark contrast to the MDF provided by giant\nstars in Baade's window which peaks at this exact location.\n2. A statistical test shows that it is unlikely to have a gap in\nthe MDF based on the microlensed dwarf stars if the microlensed sample and the giant sample from Zoccali et al.\n(2008) have been drawn from the same underlying population. We find no definitive answer to why the two distributions look different. Possible explanations include: large\nuncertainties in the analysis of the giant stars (especially the\nmetal-rich ones); a higher level than predicted contamination\nof foreground disk giant stars in the giant sample (maybe as\nhigh as 60 %); low number of microlensed dwarf stars, the\ndifference will go away once more microlensing events have\nbeen observed; a mix of all above.\n19\n\n\fT. Bensby et al.: Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars. IV.\n\n3. The metal-poor bulge is very similar to the Galactic thick\ndisk in terms of mean metallicity, elemental abundance\ntrends, as well as stellar ages. The metal-rich bulge is complicated, resembling the thin disk in terms of abundance ratios, but the thin disk does not show a wide range in ages.\nThese findings could be evidence of the co-existence of\ntwo distinct stellar populations within the bulge, each which\nmight have its own formation scenario.\n4. Combining the similarities between the metal-poor\nbulge and the thick disk with additional evidence from\nBensby et al. (2011) and Shen et al. (2010), we speculate\nthat the bulge is purely made from the stellar disk, where the\nmetal-rich bulge would be the manifestation of the inner thin\ndisk. The origin of the metal-rich bulge population might\nalso be coupled to the Galactic bar, including old stars from\nthe inner disk scattered by the bar and younger stars whose\nformation was triggered by the bar.\n5. Li abundances were presented for six of the microlensed\nstars. One star is located on the Spite plateau ([Fe/H] =\n\u22121.23 and log \u01eb(Li) = 2.16), indicating that the Spite plateau\nmight be universal. The other five stars are all metal-rich and\nshow evidence of Li depletion due to their lower effective\ntemperatures.\n6. The new events presented in this study have weakened the\nrecently discovered, and un-explained, Amax -[Fe/H] puzzle.\nWe now have stars at high [Fe/H] that have low Amax and\nstars at low [Fe/H] that have low Amax . More events are\nneeded to reveal the true nature of this puzzling relation.\n7. The recent claims by Cescutti & Matteucci (2011) of a very\nflat IMF in the bulge is not supported by the MDF and abundance trends as probed by our microlensed dwarf stars.\n8. Lastly, using the new colour-temperature calibration by\nCasagrande et al. (2010) and the now in total 26 microlensing events, we find that the colour of the bulge red clump is\n(V \u2212 I)0 = 1.06.\nAcknowledgements.
