These unidentifiable polarized features are detected as\nchanges in the polarization angle of the received signal; they are generally attributed to rapid\nchanges in Faraday rotation through a foreground Magneto-Ionic Medium (MIM) acting on\npolarized emission from a smooth Galactic synchrotron background.\nFaraday rotation produces a change in polarization angle of\nZ\n2\n\u2206\u03b8 = 0.81\u03bb ne Bk dL = \u03bb2 RM radians\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ne (cm\u22123 ) is the electron density, Bk (\u03bcG) is the component of the magnetic field\nparallel to the line of sight, L (pc) is the path length, and \u03bb (m) is the wavelength. RM is\nthe Rotation Measure. Changes in Faraday rotation imply that the intervening \"Faraday\nscreen\" has structure in the intensity or direction of the magnetic field or in the density of\nelectrons or some combination. Polarization observations therefore allow us to probe physical\nconditions in the MIM.\nIn most of the regions imaged to date, the structure is chaotic, often with features\non arcminute scales. In this paper we investigate a region of extent 2\u25e6 where polarization\nangle varies smoothly over a range \u2206\u03b8 = 100\u25e6, and structure in Stokes Q and U is smooth\nwith no counterpart in total intensity. It resembles the elliptical Faraday-rotation structure\nG137.6+1.1 described by Gray et al. (1998), a region 1\u25e6 \u00d72\u25e6 where polarization angle changes\nsmoothly by 200\u25e6 . G137.6+1.1 was interpreted as a region of smooth enhancement of electron\ndensity, with a smooth magnetic field structure. The existence of two such objects suggests\nthat they may be common in the Interstellar Medium (ISM).\nThis paper uses some results from a broader discussion of CGPS polarization observations of the area 82\u25e6 < l < 95\u25e6 , \u22123.6\u25e6 < b < 5.6\u25e6 (Uyan\u0131ker et al. in preparation), which we\nrefer to as Paper 2.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Processing\n\nThe observations are part of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (Taylor et al. 2002,\nCGPS) made with the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory\n(Landecker et al. 2000). Standard data reduction algorithms are described in Willis (1999)\nand Taylor et al. (2002). The survey covers 75\u25e6 < l < 145\u25e6 , \u22123.6\u25e6 < b < 5.6\u25e6 . Within this\nregion, images are obtained on a hexagonal grid with field centers spaced by 117\u2032 . Angular\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nresolution is 49\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 49\u2032\u2032 cosec(\u03b4).\nThe telescope receives both hands of circular polarization in four bands near 1420 MHz,\neach 7.5 MHz wide, set above and below the H I frequency by offsets of \u00b16.25 MHz and\n\u00b113.75 MHz. For the observations presented here the center frequency was 1420.64 MHz.\nVisibilities are processed into images of Stokes parameters I, Q and U in each of the four\nbands using standard aperture-synthesis techniques. Q and U images are corrected for\ninstrumental polarization across the field of view, and are assembled into mosaics. Images\npresented here are averages from all four bands.\nThe telescope samples baselines from 12.9 to 617 m with an increment of 4.286 m, and\nall structure from the resolution limit of \u223c1\u2032 up to \u223c45\u2032 is represented in the images from\nthe Synthesis Telescope. Information from single-antenna data has been incorporated into\nthe I data (as is standard practice for the CGPS), but no attempt has been made to recover\ninformation corresponding to larger polarization structure, and single-antenna data have not\nbeen added to the Q and U images discussed in this paper.\n1/2\n\nPolarized intensity, P I, nominally (Q2 + U 2 ) , is calculated as\nP I = (Q2 + U 2 \u2212 (1.2\u03c3)2 )1/2 , where \u03c3 = 30 mK TB is the rms noise in the mosaiced Q and\nU images, in order to provide a first-order correction for noise bias. The polarization angle\nin each of the four bands is calculated as \u03b8\u03bb = 12 arctan (U/Q). RM can be calculated from\nthe four values of \u03b8\u03bb when the signal-to-noise ratio is adequate.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 1 shows I and P I images, and Figure 2 shows Q and U images from the CGPS\ndatabase in a region 88\u25e6 < l < 95\u25e6 , \u22123.\u25e6 6 < b < 1\u25e6 .\nObjects visible in the I image include the SNRs CTB 104A (at l = 93.\u25e6 7, b = \u22120.\u25e6 2) and\n3C434.1 (at l = 94.\u25e6 0, b = 1.\u25e6 0, partly seen at the upper edge of the image). Strong polarized\nemission from CTB 104A is evident in the P I, Q, and U images, but no polarized emission\ncorresponding to 3C434.1 has been detected. The polarized emission from CTB 104A is\ndiscussed by Uyan\u0131ker et al. (2002). An H II region, S 124, is seen at l = 94.\u25e6 5, b =\n\u22121.\u25e6 5, consisting of a bright, compact object embedded in extended emission. Diffuse, lowbrightness emission fills the I image north of b \u2248 \u22120.\u25e6 5.\nWithin the area shown in Figure 2, at l = 91.\u25e6 75, b = \u22122.\u25e6 45, is an elliptical region of\nextent nearly 2\u25e6 where the structure in Q and U changes very smoothly, indicating that\npolarization angle changes slowly and systematically. No counterpart in total intensity is\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndetectable in Figure 1. This unusual feature is the subject of this paper. To give the object\na name that reflects its appearance, we refer to it as the Polarized Lens (PL), but this is\nnot intended to suggest any particular interpretation. The contrast between the PL and the\nSNR CTB104A is very striking. The SNR shows very strong P I and chaotic, small-scale\nstructure in Q and U while the PL shows strong, smoothly structured Q and U emission but\nvery low P I. To the west and north-west of the PL there are regions of small-scale chaotic\nstructure, again with no counterpart in total intensity, whose appearance is characteristic of\nthe polarized emission in many directions in the Galactic plane (see references cited in the\nIntroduction).\nThe area shown in Figures 1 and 2 is at the southern edge of the CGPS region, and\nthe data become noisy at the extreme edge. However, we are confident that the PL does\nnot extend south beyond the limit of these images. An overlapping region was observed by\nHiggs et al. (2001); those observations are consistent with our data where they overlap, and\nextend well to the south of the field presented here, showing very low levels of Q and U.\nFigures 3 displays total intensity, I, scaled to show lower intensities than are seen in\nFigure 1. Extended emission is seen in the field; most of it is probably thermal in origin. Some\nof this emission is related to known objects, also indicated in Figure 3; these are discussed in\ndetail below. However, there is no extended emission which resembles the PL in form, and\nwe consider that the PL is a region where the polarized \"object\" has no counterpart in I; it\nis one of the Faraday objects described in the Introduction.\nFigure 3 also shows polarized intensity, P I, and polarization angle in a region centered\non the PL. Polarization vectors are superimposed on the P I image. Because the polarized\nstructure is very smooth, the P I and angle images have been derived from data convolved\nto 5\u2032 resolution. For reference, two ellipses are superimposed on the images of Figure 3, both\ncentered at l = 91.\u25e6 75, b = \u22122.\u25e6 45. The larger ellipse, 90\u2032 \u00d7 108\u2032, marks the approximate\nlimit of the smooth structure. The smaller ellipse, 72\u2032 \u00d7 42\u2032 , approximately follows the inner\ncontours in the polarization angle image of Figure 3.\nThe emission here is quite strongly polarized, but very smooth. The overall extent of\nthe polarization feature, defined as the region in which polarization angle varies smoothly,\nis about 100\u2032. Within this region the polarized intensity, P I, rises to \u223c0.08 K, while in the\nimmediate surroundings P I is mostly below the sensitivity limit of the telescope.\nFigure 4 shows the variation of polarization angle along the major axis of the larger\nellipse. The change of angle through the PL is \u223c 100\u25e6 , corresponding to a RM change of\n40 rad m\u22122 . The signal-to-noise ratio is inadequate to permit the derivation of an image of\nRM.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.\n\nPossible Relationship to Other Objects in the Field\n\nIn seeking to interpret the PL we have investigated possible associations with a variety\nof objects in this direction. There are many objects along this line of sight, which passes\nalong the local spiral arm close to the Galactic plane; some are identified in Figure 3.\n\n4.1.\n\nPossible supernova remnant\n\nKassim (1988a) reported a source at (l, b) = (92.0\u25e6, \u22122.6\u25e6 ) with an extent of 44\u2032 \u00d7 35\u2032 ,\ndetected in the Clark Lake survey at 30.9 MHz (resolution 15\u2032 ); the reported flux density at\n30.9 MHz was 23 Jy. Kassim originally identified this with 4C 47.56 at (l, b) = (92.\u25e6 23, \u22122.\u25e697).\nHowever, in a subsequent paper he suggested the Clark-Lake source might be an SNR (Kassim 1988b).\nWe note that other low-frequency surveys do not indicate the presence of an extended\nlow-frequency source corresponding to the PL. No source is detected in the 22.25 MHz\nDRAO survey (Roger et al. 1999), with resolution 1.\u25e6 1 \u00d7 1.\u25e6 7 at this sky position. The 34.5\nMHz Gauribidanur survey of Dwarakanath & Udaya Shankar (1990, resolution 26\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032 )\nshows a depression at this location. Gorham (1990) does not confirm G92.0\u22122.6 as an SNR\nfrom examination of radio continuum surveys at 1420 and 2695 MHz. However, Gorham\nnotes a possibly related infrared feature in the IRAS 60 \u03bcm data. Our examination of the\nCGPS infrared database (Cao et al. 1997) has revealed a depression in the infrared emission\ncoinciding roughly with the PL.\nNevertheless, the appearance of the PL in polarized intensity does bear some resemblance to an SNR (see Figure 3). There is a bright outer ridge of emission, and a central\nfeature, defining a morphology reminiscent of a composite SNR. The outer ridge shows strong\nbilateral symmetry about the major axis of the smaller ellipse. The integrated polarized intensity at 1420 MHz is \u223c0.9 Jy, which, assuming <50% fractional polarization, implies a\ntotal flux density of >2 Jy. With a spectral index of \u03b1 = 0.5 (S \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ), the flux density\nwould be >14 Jy at 30.9 MHz, plausibly consistent with the flux density of 23 Jy reported\nby Kassim.\nHowever, the smooth polarization structure does not resemble that of a typical SNR.\nThose SNRs whose polarized emission is seen in this vicinity show generally chaotic structure\non arcminute scales (as demonstrated by CTB 104A \u2013 see Figure 2). Young SNRs have\nradial magnetic field, producing polarization vectors which follow the circumference. Old\nSNRs have circumferential field, and radial E vectors. To produce the observed pattern of\npolarization vectors would require a very special distribution of Faraday rotation, and we\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nconsider this an unlikely circumstance.\n4C 47.56 (at (l, b) = (92.0\u25e6 , \u22122.6\u25e6 )) lies very close to the eastern boundary of the\nlarger ellipse (see Figure 3). Its location relative to the structure seen in polarized intensity\nsuggests it could be related to the PL. However, its spectral index, derived from published\nflux densities between 151 and 4850 MHz, together with values derived from our own 1420\nMHz data, is \u03b1 = 1.03\u00b10.04, typical of an extragalactic source. The predicted flux density\nat 30.9 MHz is 24.8 Jy, entirely consistent with the value obtained by Kassim (1988a). There\nis thus no excess flux density at 30.9 MHz which might require the hypothesized SNR.\n\n4.2.\n\nH I feature G92\u22124+50\n\nHiggs et al. (2001) report an unusual H I structure at (l, b)\u2243(92\u25e6 , \u22124\u25e6 ), with a velocity\nof vLSR = 50 km s\u22121 which partially overlaps the PL in position. However, we can find no\nmorphological resemblance between this H I structure, or any other H I structure in the field,\nand the PL.\n\n4.3.\n\nH II Region LBN 416\n\nLynds (1965) lists a filamentary emission nebula, LBN 416 (indicated in Figure 3)\ncrossing the position of the PL. The position and size, determined by Lynds from the Palomar\nSky Survey, are (l, b) = (91.\u25e666, \u22122.\u25e6 54) and 80\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 . The object is seen clearly in total\nintensity in our observations. CGPS data at 408 MHz confirm that the emission from\nLBN 416 has a thermal spectrum, and we therefore consider it to be an H II region.\nThe peak brightness temperature of LBN 416 is 0.2K, and the integrated flux density\nat 1420 MHz is roughly 0.7 Jy, with a measured extent of 90\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032 . We have modeled\nthe H II region as a cylinder of ionized gas (using a program written by L.A. Higgs). We\nobtain reasonable fits to the observed parameters with electron densities of 8 and 2 cm\u22123\nfor assumed distances of 0.25 and 2.5 kpc respectively, with corresponding variation for\nintermediate distances. We assume that the filament is cylindrical, so that the line-of-sight\ndepth through it is equal to its transverse extent. Further assuming a magnetic field of 2\n\u03bcG, the Faraday rotation through the filament would be 36\u25e6 at a distance of 0.25 kpc, and\n120\u25e6 at a distance of 2.5 kpc. If LBN 416 were in front of the PL, such rotations would easily\nbe detected in our data. The fact that they are not, implies that LBN 416 is behind the PL.\nIn fact, the absence of any polarization effect attributable to LBN 416 probably implies that\nit is more distant than 2 kpc (see Section 5.3 where we discuss the distance of detectable\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\npolarization features). We conclude that LBN 416 and the PL are unrelated.\n\n4.4.\n\nStars in the field\n\nAn open star cluster, M39 (NGC7092), partly overlaps the PL; its distance is 265 pc\n(McNamara & Sanders 1977) and the PL could conceivably be produced by effects of one or\nmore of its stars. The nominal cluster center is (l, b) = (92.\u25e6 2, \u22122.\u25e6 5). Of 7931 cataloged stars\nin the field, roughly 60 have a probability of membership >90% (Platais 1994), and these\nare indicated in Figure 3. The brightest 25 of these stars range in spectral type from B8 to\nA0, and their combined ionizing flux might form a Str\u00f6mgren sphere of diameter a few pc,\ndependent on local conditions of ambient density. This is too small to account for the PL.\nThere are two B stars within the boundary of the PL. The B3 star, No. 3721 in Platais\n(1994), lies at (l, b) = (92.\u25e6 12, \u22122.\u25e6 51). The Tycho catalog (H\u00f8g et al. 2000) gives its\nparallactic distance as 300 pc. Although it is at a comparable distance to M39, Platais\n(1994) did not include this star in the membership list. Its color index is (B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.m 24.\nHowever, such a star can ionize a region of order 1 pc in diameter in a region of ne = 1 cm\u22123 ,\nsubtending an angle of only \u223c10\u2032 at the distance of the star, much smaller than the PL.\nThe second is a B0 star (Platais 1994, LS +47\u25e6 47, No. 4071) close to the center of the\nPL, at (l, b) = (92.\u25e602, \u22122.\u25e6 71); this star is probably not a member of M39. The star has a\ncolor index (B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.m 13. The absolute magnitude of a main sequence B0 star, on the\nother hand, is MV = \u22123.m 4. These parameters yield a distance about 12 kpc for the star\nif it is on the main sequence. To bring this star within 1 kpc, where it might conceivably\nbe related to the PL, it must have evolved to the point where it has spawned a planetary\nnebula. No such nebula has been detected.\nThe offset between the PL and M39 makes an association between the two objects\nunlikely, and the cluster has insufficient ionizing flux to generate the PL. Of the two B stars\nin the field one has inadequate ionizing flux to explain the PL and the other is too distant.\nWe cannot explain the PL on the basis of known stars in the field.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIs the PL an isolated structure?\n\nThe images of polarized emission shown in Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the PL is\nan isolated structure. However, the DRAO Synthesis Telescope has limited sensitivity to\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nstructures larger than 45\u2032 for all Stokes parameters. It is important to consider whether our\ndata are missing any component that is vital to the correct interpretation of the PL.\nThere is no doubt that we have detected significant structure in Q and U from the PL.\nWe have also observed an absence of Q and U in the areas surrounding the PL, and this too\nis a significant result. Nevertheless, the question remains: is there a large polarized object\nin this direction, of which the Synthesis Telescope has seen only a small part? The best\nanswer to that question would be provided by complementary single-antenna observations\nwhich could be appropriately combined with the Synthesis Telescope data, but such data\nare not available. The best we can do in answering that question is to turn to the existing\nsingle-antenna data.\nWe have examined the data of Brouw & Spoelstra (1976) for this region, observed\nwith a 36\u2032 beam at 1420 MHz. In the area 90\u25e6 < l < 94\u25e6 , \u22124\u25e6 < b < 0\u25e6 there are 6\nobservations. Polarized intensity varies from 0.05 to 0.13 K, except for one corner of the\nregion where the value is 0.39 K (the mean error of these observations is quoted as 0.06\nK). The polarization angle throughout the region is 145\u25e6 \u00b1 25\u25e6 . Considering the errors\nand the severe undersampling, these data support a picture of a region of roughly constant\npolarized intensity and angle. The peak polarized intensity of the PL measured in our data,\n\u223c0.08 K, is comparable to the polarized intensity of the \"background\" measured by Brouw\nand Spoelstra. Examination of other data from the same paper at four lower frequencies\n(down to 408 MHz) also shows a low-level, fairly smooth structure. The smooth component\nis likely to be a foreground, since distant, and consequently small, structure will average to\na very low value in the broad beam of the telescope used by Brouw and Spoelstra.\nWe therefore proceed on the assumption that our observations have \"seen\" all of the PL.\nIn this connection, we note that G137.6+1.1 was apparently detected in its entirety by the\nDRAO Synthesis Telescope in the observations described by Gray et al. (1998). Observations\nwith the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope at 1420 MHz (W. Reich, private communication) confirm\nthis, and show G137.6+1.1 superimposed on a uniform but intense polarized background.\n\n5.2.\n\nIs the PL an ionized or a magnetic feature?\n\nThe morphology of the PL gives the impression of a confined region, and in the following\ndiscussion we assume that the PL has a depth along the line of sight equal to its observed\nextent on the sky, approximately 29D pc, where D is the distance in kpc. We consider it\nunlikely that the PL is produced by a long cylindrical structure at a fortuitous alignment.\nWe assume that the regular and random components of the local magnetic field have values\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n2 \u03bcG and 4 \u03bcG respectively (Beck 2001), and that the regular component is directed towards\nl \u2248 83\u25e6 (Heiles 1996).\nThrough analysis of RMs of extragalactic point sources from the CGPS database, Brown\n& Taylor (2001) have delineated a region of size \u223c2.\u25e6 5 centered on l = 92\u25e6 , b = 0\u25e6 where\nthe magnetic field reverses its direction, refining an earlier detection by Clegg et al. (1992).\nThe cause of the field reversal has not been identified. The PL lies at the southern edge\nof this magnetic anomaly and the question arises whether the two are related. The SNR\nCTB 104A also lies on the edge of this region, and Uyan\u0131ker et al. (2002) have shown that\nthe magnetic field direction in the vicinity of the SNR is opposite to that of the prevailing\nmagnetic field, and is aligned with the field in the anomaly. The SNR and the anomaly\nare therefore at the same distance. Uyan\u0131ker et al. (2002) also show that the distance to\nCTB 104A is approximately 1.5 kpc. We show below that the PL is much closer, at about\n600 pc. The PL is therefore unrelated to the magnetic anomaly.\nNevertheless, the possibility that the PL is a magnetic phenomenon must be considered.\nA change in Faraday rotation such as that generated by the PL must be associated with an\nexcess or deficit of electrons, or with a change in the magnetic field intensity or direction, or\nwith some combination of the two. If the excess RM in the PL is produced by a magnetic field\nfluctuation alone, the required change is \u223c15 \u03bcG for ne = 0.2 cm\u22123 , considerably larger than\nthe expected random field fluctuations, and we consider it unlikely that the PL is solely a\nmagnetic field phenomenon. This leaves a deficit or excess of electrons. The required change\nin ne is of the order of 1 cm\u22123 , and a deficit of this magnitude can only be accommodated\nif the surrounding electron density is quite high. Further, a region where there is a deficit of\nelectrons relative to the surroundings must be filled with neutral gas to maintain pressure\nbalance, and neither atomic or molecular material is in evidence (although the sensitivity of\navailable observations does not allow us to categorically exclude such an occurrence). We\nproceed, therefore, on the assumption that the PL is the result of a local enhancement of\nelectron density. This enhancement is possibly accompanied by a magnetic field structural\nchange, probably also an enhancement, but the magnetic field must be very smooth. In\nconsidering G137.6+1.1, Gray et al. (1998) have presented very similar arguments.\n\n5.3.\n\nGeneral remarks on the distance to polarization features\n\nIn this direction our line of sight is about 10\u25e6 from the axis of the local spiral arm,\nwhich we judge to coincide with the brightest emission from the Cygnus-X region at l = 80\u25e6 .\nThe line of sight is thus nearly parallel to the local field direction, and Faraday rotation\nis strong. It is shown in Paper 2 that the Faraday screen that generates the bulk of the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\npolarized signal in this region is within the local arm. Polarized emission originating at larger\ndistances, either in distinct synchrotron sources such as SNRs or in more distant Faraday\nscreens, is rendered undetectable by beam depolarization in the local Faraday screen. Depth\ndepolarization is also a strong effect. (Beam depolarization is also referred to as differential\nFaraday rotation and depth depolarization as internal Faraday dispersion; these effects are\ndiscussed by Sokoloff et al. (1998)). Paper 2 presents evidence that this distance, which is\nreferred to there as the polarization horizon, is about 2 kpc. Some of the evidence is seen\nin Figure 1. Polarized emission is detected from the SNR CTB 104A (G93.7\u22120.2), which is\nwithin the Local arm (Uyan\u0131ker et al. 2002), but no polarized emission is detected from the\nSNR 3C434.1 (G94.0+1.0), which is a Perseus Arm object (Foster 2000). For more detailed\narguments about the distance to the polarization horizon, the reader is referred to Paper 2.\nOur first conclusion is that the PL must be closer than about 2 kpc. However, in a\ndirection where total beam depolarization occurs over a distance of 2 kpc, a feature with the\nhighly regular polarization structure of the PL must be much closer.\n\n5.4.\n\nConsiderations based on synchrotron emissivity\n\nThe peak polarized intensity on the PL is about 0.08 K. Assuming that the emission\nis 70% polarized at source, the emitted intensity is at least 0.11 K. This emission must be\ngenerated along a path within the polarization horizon or it could not be detected. This value\nis a lower limit: when the detectable polarized emission is produced by Faraday rotation, the\nlevel of polarized intensity detected is strongly dependent on the rotation in the foreground\nscreen.\nThe synchrotron emissivity at 408 MHz has been determined by Beuermann et al.\n(1985), based on an analysis of a whole-sky survey at that frequency. These authors obtain\na value equivalent to 11 K per kpc of path at 408 MHz. When translated to 1420 MHz using\na temperature spectral index \u03b2 = 2.8, the value is 0.26 K/kpc. Roger et al. (1999) measured\nthe local synchrotron emissivity at 22 MHz by observing the brightness temperature against\nforeground H II regions, which absorb more distant emission. They observed two H II\nregions close to the PL, S 117 (G85.5\u22121.0) at a distance of 800 pc, and S 131 (G99.3+3.7)\nat a distance of 860 pc. The two values obtained were 21,800 K/kpc and 43,500 K/kpc.\nThe average value from eight H II regions, 30,000 K/kpc, well represents local conditions.\nTranslating this value to 1420 MHz, again using \u03b2 = 2.8, gives 0.33 K/kpc.\nTaking the mean of these two determinations of the local emissivity, we can calculate\nthat a path length of about 400 pc is required to generate 0.11 K of synchrotron emission.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThere must therefore be at least 400 pc of path length within the polarization horizon,\nbehind the PL. The maximum distance to the PL is therefore \u223c1.6 kpc. Again, this is not\na severe constraint, and the smooth structure implies a closer distance.\n\n5.5.\n\nDistance constraints based on the properties of ionized regions\n\nConstraints on the distance to the PL can be obtained from consideration of the properties of emission from ionized gas, and exploring the properties of a Faraday rotating region\nwhich can produce the observed rotation angle, \u03b8, at 1420 MHz while remaining undetectable\nin total intensity. We assume that the PL is a region of enhanced electron density, but note\nthat the following arguments apply equally to a deficit of electrons.\nThe optical depth of a region of free-free emission is\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121.35 \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0013\nTe\n\u03bd \u0011\u22122.1\nE\n\u22122\n\u03c4 = 8.235 \u00d7 10\nK\nGHz\npc cm\u22126\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Te is the electron temperature and E = n2e L is the emission measure (Rohlfs & Wilson\n1996). The brightness temperature is related to \u03c4 by\nTb = Te 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\n\n\u0001\n\n(3)\n\nWe assume that the PL has electron temperature Te = 7000 K, a value typical of\nGalactic H II regions, and we will consider initially a magnetic field of Bk = 2 \u03bcG. The\nangular extent of the source is \u03b8 = 100\u2032 and we assume a spherical ionized region whose\ndiameter is determined from its angular size. We then calculate ne for various values of\n\u2206\u03b8, and derive the anticipated brightness temperature and emission measure. The results\nof this calculation are plotted in the top two panels of Figure 5. Since we do not detect the\nPL optically, or as a feature in the I image, we can constrain its distance. The theoretical\ncontinuum sensitivity of the DRAO Synthesis Telescope is 0.071 sin\u03b4 K rms, where \u03b4 is\nthe declination (Landecker et al. 2000). For the present observations the value achieved in\nareas free of complex structure is \u223c0.05 K, consistent with expectation. In the top panel of\nFigure 5 we show the 2\u03c3 and 4\u03c3 values.\nThe observed value of \u2206\u03b8 = 100\u25e6 and the non-detection of the PL in I constrain the\ndistance to be larger than about 400 pc. On the other hand, we have already established\nthat it must be closer than \u223c1.6 kpc. Furthermore, if it is close to that limit, we would\nexpect superimposed foreground Faraday rotation to detract from its smooth appearance.\nWe therefore choose a somewhat arbitrary upper limit of half that distance, 800 pc. Based\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\non these arguments the distance is 600 \u00b1 200 pc, and the linear size of the PL is 18 \u00b1 6 pc.\nThe magnetic field must be very smooth over this region.\nIf the magnetic field is also enhanced within the PL, then its distance could be substantially smaller. For example, doubling the field from Bk = 2 \u03bcG to 4 \u03bcG would lower the\ndistance limit by a factor of about four; the effect of changing the assumed field is shown in\nthe lower panel of Figure 5. A lower distance would ease the problem of maintaining field\nuniformity across the PL.\nA doubling of the field inside the PL does not seem unreasonable, given the enhancement\nof electron density, which exceeds the surroundings by at least a factor of 10. Under these\ncircumstances the distance would be 150 \u00b1 50 pc. While this nearer distance would seem\na reasonable choice, we caution that the PL cannot be at a very nearby distance. If we\nassume that the source of the ionization is a star of some kind, then it would probably have\nbeen detected by existing observations. We therefore consider that the PL is at least at the\ndistance of the open cluster M39, which is 265 pc (see \u00a74.4).\nStriking a balance between these arguments, we place the PL at a distance of 350\u00b150 pc,\nin a magnetic field of Bk \u2248 3 \u03bcG. The excess electron density within the PL relative to its\nsurroundings is 1.5 < ne < 2 cm\u22123 , the emission measure is 25 < E < 34 cm\u22126 pc, the radio\nbrightness temperature is Tb \u2248 0.05 K. At 350 pc the mass of ionized gas in the PL is 23\nM\u2299 .\n\n5.6.\n\nAre there many such objects?\n\nTable 1 compares the PL, which we now designate as G91.8\u22122.5, with G137.6+1.1. The\nobjects are similar in electron density and structure. We note that the Faraday rotation per\nunit depth through the two objects is very similar. The distances are not particularly well\ndetermined in either case, but G91.8\u22122.5 is apparently closer and smaller.\nThe similarity of G91.8\u22122.5 and G137.6+1.1 suggests that they are two representatives\nof a class of object that might be quite common in the ISM. We incline to this view, and will\nuse the term PL generically to refer to them. We suggest that more PLs will be detected as\nmore of the Galactic plane is mapped with high-resolution polarimetry. The mass of ionized\ngas required to generate a PL is from a few tens to a few hundred M\u2299 . The ionizing radiation\nrequired to sustain such a region can be provided by an early B star. However, in the two PLs\ndiscovered to date, no such star has been detected. Furthermore, the turbulence in an H II\nregion around such a star would probably dictate against smooth structure, and it is likely\nthat PLs are relatively old structures. The source of ionization for these regions remains\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nto be clarified, possibly through the discovery of further examples. Their distribution in\nGalactic latitude and longitude may give clues to their origin.\n\n5.7.\n\nHow do we detect objects of this type?\n\nG137.6+1.1 is detectable because it is superimposed on the H II region W5. The dense,\nturbulent ionized gas in W5 completely eliminates any polarized emission from behind the\nH II region through its strong beam depolarization. How can we see G91.8\u22122.5 without a\nstrong H II region behind it? In this case, a strong polarization-horizon effect in the local\narm serves the equivalent function. At 1420 MHz, these backgrounds may be optically thin,\nbut they are \"Faraday thick\".\nThe regular polarization structure of PLs like G91.8\u22122.5 and G137.6+1.1 can be easily\nobscured by the chaotic small-scale structure that is seen in many directions. This will\nhappen particularly strongly if the small-scale structure is in front of the PL, but small-scale\nstructure behind it will also have an effect. The detection of PLs therefore requires more\nthan a Faraday-thick background, it also requires a path where the structure of the MIM is\nrelatively unperturbed. G137.6+1.1 appears to lie in the region between the local and Perseus\nspiral arms. Magnetic fields in the inter-arm regions can be expected to be less tangled by\nthe disruptive effects of star-formation. G91.8\u22122.5 is more difficult to understand. Given\nthe very complex structure expected within the local arm, it is surprising that magnetic field\nstructure along the line of sight is sufficiently unperturbed to allow the structure to be seen.\nThe closer the object is to us, the easier it is to explain, and this reasoning possibly favors\nthe closer distance to G91.8\u22122.5.\nIn conclusion, PLs may be quite common in the MIM, but rather special conditions are\nrequired for their detection. The detection of the PL phenomenon requires that background\nsynchrotron emission be thoroughly depolarized. Large H II regions will do this effectively,\nand the polarization-horizon phenomenon can also be effective, especially in directions near\nl = 90\u25e6 where the line of sight is parallel to the regular field component. The PL arises\nfrom the Faraday rotation in a smooth foreground feature of synchrotron emission generated\nrelatively nearby. In addition, MIM structure along the line of sight must be relatively\nuniform. Detection of nearby PLs is also easier. Only further observations will show how\noften these conditions are met.\nWe thank Andrew Gray and Russ Taylor for their comments on a draft of this paper.\nThe Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory is operated as a national Facility by the\nNational Research Council of Canada.

Vectors\nsuperimposed on the middle image have length proportional to P I and orientation \u03b8. The\nconcentric ellipses with major axes at right angles to each other are centered at l = 91.\u25e6 75,\nb = \u22122.\u25e6 45. In the upper image, the filled star symbols show the members of M39, while\noutline stars show the B0 and B3 (higher b) stars mentioned in the text.\nFig. 4.- Variation of polarization angle along the major axis of the larger ellipse in Figure 3.\nAngle has been \"unwrapped\" to remove the 180\u25e6 ambiguity over the regions more than about\n15\u2032 from the center of the plot.\nFig. 5.- Variation of brightness temperature (top) and emission measure (middle) as a\nfunction of the distance of a spherical enhancement of electron density which causes a Faraday\nrotation \u2206\u03b8 in a magnetic field Bk = 2 \u03bcG. The lowest curve corresponds to \u2206\u03b8 = 20\u25e6 and\nthe increment in angle is 20\u25e6 . The horizontal lines in the top plot indicate the 2\u03c3 and 4\u03c3\nsensitivity levels of the telescope. The bottom panel shows the effect of changing magnetic\nfield. \u2206\u03b8 = 100\u25e6 and all other assumptions are unchanged. The highest curve corresponds\nto Bk = 1 \u03bcG and the field increases in steps of 0.5 \u03bcG.\n\n\fThis figure \"f1.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0204274v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f2.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0204274v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f3.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0204274v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f4.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0204274v1\n\n\fThis figure \"f5.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0204274v1\n\n\f"}
