The crucial point is that any semigroup operation \u2217\ndefined on a discrete space X can be extended to a right-topological semigroup\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20M99, 54B20.\n1Unpublished, see [HS, p.102], [H2]\n1\n\n\f2\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\noperation on \u03b2(X), the Stone-\u010cech compactification of X. The extension of the\noperation from X to \u03b2(X) can be defined by the simple formula:\n(1)\n\nU \u25e6 V = {A \u2282 X : {x \u2208 X : x\u22121 A \u2208 V} \u2208 U},\n\nwhere U, V are ultrafilters on X and x\u22121 A = {y \u2208 X : xy \u2208 A}. Endowed\n\nwith the so-extended operation, the Stone-\u010cech compactification \u03b2(X) becomes a\ncompact right-topological semigroup. The algebraic properties of this semigroup\n(for example, the existence of idempotents or minimal left ideals) have important\nconsequences in combinatorics of numbers, see [HS], [P].\nThe Stone-\u010cech compactification \u03b2(X) of X is the subspace of the double powerset P(P(X)), which is a complete lattice with respect to the operations of union\nand intersection. In [G2] it was observed that the semigroup operation extends not\nonly to \u03b2(X) but also to the complete sublattice G(X) of P(P(X)) generated by\n\u03b2(X). This complete sublattice consists of all inclusion hyperspaces over X.\nBy definition, a family F of non-empty subsets of a discrete space X is called\nan inclusion hyperspace if F is monotone in the sense that a subset A \u2282 X belongs\nto F provided A contains some set B \u2208 F . On the set G(X) there is an important transversality operation assigning to each inclusion hyperspace F \u2208 G(X) the\ninclusion hyperspace\n\nF \u22a5 = {A \u2282 X : \u2200F \u2208 F (A \u2229 F 6= \u2205)}.\nThis operation is involutive in the sense that (F \u22a5 )\u22a5 = F .\n\nIt is known that the family G(X) of inclusion hyperspaces on X is closed in\n\nthe double power-set P(P(X)) = {0, 1}P(X) endowed with the natural product\ntopology. The induced topology on G(X) can be described directly: it is generated\nby the sub-base consisting of the sets\nU + = {F \u2208 G(X) : U \u2208 F } and U \u2212 = {F \u2208 G(X) : U \u2208 F \u22a5 }\nwhere U runs over subsets of X. Endowed with this topology, G(X) becomes a\nHausdorff supercompact space. The latter means that each cover of G(X) by the\nsub-basic sets has a 2-element subcover.\nThe extension of a binary operation \u2217 from X to G(X) can be defined in the\nsame way as for ultrafilters, i.e., by the formula (1) applied to any two inclusion\nhyperspaces U, V \u2208 G(X). In [G2] it was shown that for an associative binary\n\noperation \u2217 on X the space G(X) endowed with the extended operation becomes a\ncompact right-topological semigroup. The algebraic properties of this semigroups\nwere studied in details in [G2].\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n3\n\nBesides the Stone-\u010cech compactification \u03b2(X), the semigroup G(X) contains\nmany important spaces as closed subsemigroups. In particular, the space\n\u03bb(X) = {F \u2208 G(X) : F = F \u22a5 }\nof maximal linked systems on X is a closed subsemigroup of G(X). The space \u03bb(X)\nis well-known in General and Categorial Topology as the superextension of X, see\n[vM], [TZ]. Endowed with the extended binary operation, the superextension \u03bb(X)\nof a semigroup X is a supercompact right-topological semigroup containing \u03b2(X)\nas a subsemigroup.\nThe space \u03bb(X) consists of maximal linked systems on X. We recall that a\nsystem of subsets L of X is linked if A \u2229 B 6= \u2205 for all A, B \u2208 L. An inclusion\n\nhyperspace A \u2208 G(X) is linked if and only if A \u2282 A\u22a5 . The family of all linked\ninclusion hyperspace on X is denoted by N2 (X). It is a closed subset in G(X).\nMoreover, if X is a semigroup, then N2 (X) is a closed subsemigroup of G(X). The\nsuperextension \u03bb(X) consists of all maximal elements of N2 (X), see [G1], [G2].\nIn this paper we start a systematic investigation of the algebraic structure of the\nsemigroup \u03bb(X). This program will be continued in the forthcoming papers [BG2]\nand [BG3]. The interest to studying the semigroup \u03bb(X) was motivated by the\nfact that for each maximal linked system L on X and each partition X = A \u222a B\n\nof X into two sets A, B either A or B belongs to L. This makes possible to apply\n\nmaximal linked systems to Combinatorics and Ramsey Theory.\nIn this paper we concentrate on describing zeros and commutativity of the semi-\n\ngroup \u03bb(X). In Proposition 3.1 we shall show that a maximal linked system\nL \u2208 \u03bb(X) is a right zero of \u03bb(X) if and only if L is invariant in the sense that\n\nxL \u2208 L for all L \u2208 L and all x \u2208 X. In Theorem 3.2 we shall prove that a group\nX admits an invariant maximal linked system (equivalently, \u03bb(X) contains a right\nzero) if and only if each element of X has odd order. The situation with (left) zeros\nis a bit different: a maximal linked system L \u2208 \u03bb(X) is a left zero in \u03bb(X) if and\n\nonly if L is a zero in \u03bb(X) if and only if L is a unique invariant maximal linked\nsystem on X. The semigroup \u03bb(X) has a (left) zero if and only if X is a finite\ngroup of odd order |X| \u2264 5 (equivalently, X is isomorphic to the cyclic group C1 ,\nC3 or C5 ). The semigroup \u03bb(X) rarely is commutative: this holds if and only if the\ngroup X has finite order |X| \u2264 4.\nWe start the paper studying self-linked subsets of groups. By definition, a subset\nA of a group X is called self-linked if A\u2229xA 6= \u2205 for all x \u2208 X. In Proposition 1.1 we\n\nshall give lower and upper bounds for the smallest cardinality sl(X) of a self-linked\nsubset of X. We use those bounds to characterize groups X with sl(X) \u2265 |X|/2 in\nTheorem 1.2.\n\n\f4\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\nIn Section 2 we apply self-linked sets to evaluating the cardinality of the (rect\u2194\n\nangular) semigroup \u03bb (X) of maximal invariant linked systems on a group X. In\n\u2194\n\nTheorem 2.2 we show that for an infinite group X the cardinality of \u03bb (X) equals\n|X|\n\n22\n\n\u2194\n\n. In Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.6 we calculate the cardinality of \u03bb (X) for\n\u2194\n\nall finite groups X of order |X| \u2264 8 and also detect groups X with | \u03bb (X)| = 1.\nIn Sections 4 and 5 these results are applied for characterizing groups X whose\nsuperextensions have zeros or are commutative.\nWe finish the paper with a description of the algebraic structure of the superextensions of groups X of order |X| \u2264 5.\n\nNow a couple of words about notations. Following the algebraic tradition, by Cn\nwe denote the cyclic group of order n and by D2n the dihedral group of cardinality\n2n, that is, the isometry group of the regular n-gon. For a group X by e we denote\nthe neutral element of X. For a real number x we put\n\u2308x\u2309 = min{n \u2208 Z : n \u2265 x} and \u230ax\u230b = max{n \u2208 Z : n \u2264 x}.\n1. Self-linked sets in groups\nIn this section we study self-linked subsets in groups. By definition, a subset A\n\nof a group G is self-linked if A \u2229 xA 6= \u2205 for each x \u2208 G. In fact, this notion can be\ndefined in the more general context of G-spaces.\nBy a G-space we understand a set X endowed with a left action G \u00d7 X \u2192 X\n\nof a group G. Each group G will be considered as a G-space endowed with the\nleft action of G. An important example of a G-space is the homogeneous space\nG/H = {xH : x \u2208 G} of a group G by a subgroup H \u2282 G.\nA subset A \u2282 X of a G-space X defined to be self-linked if A \u2229 gA 6= \u2205 for all\ng \u2208 G. Let us observe that a subset A \u2282 G of a group G is self-linked if and only\nif AA\u22121 = G.\n\nFor a G-space X by sl(X) we denote the smallest cardinality |A| of a self-linked\nsubset A \u2282 X. Some lower and upper bounds for sl(G) are established in the\n\nfollowing proposition.\n\nProposition 1.1. Let G be a finite group and H be a subgroup of G. Then\np\n(1) sl(G) \u2265 (1 + 4|G| \u2212 3)/2;\n(2) sl(G) \u2264 sl(H) * sl(G/H) \u2264 sl(H) * \u2308(|G/H| + 1)/2\u2309.\n(3) sl(G) < |H| + |G/H|.\n\nProof. 1. Take any self-linked set A \u2282 G of cardinality |A| = sl(G) and consider\n\nthe surjective map f : A \u00d7 A \u2192 G, f : (x, y) 7\u2192 xy \u22121 . Since f (x, y) = xy \u22121 = e for\nall (x, y) \u2208 \u2206A = {(x, y) \u2208 A2 : x = y}, we get |G| = |G \\ {e}| + 1 \u2264 |A2 \\ \u2206A | + 1 =\np\nsl(G)2 \u2212 sl(G) + 1, which just implies that sl(G) \u2265 (1 + 4|G| \u2212 3)/2.\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n5\n\n2a. Let H be a subgroup of G. Take self-linked sets A \u2282 H and B \u2282 G/H =\n\n{xH : x \u2208 G} having sizes |A| = sl(H) and |B| = sl(G/H). Fix any subset B \u2282 G\nsuch that |B| = |B| and {xH : x \u2208 B} = B. We claim that the set C = BA is\n\nself-linked. Given arbitrary x \u2208 G we should prove that the intersection C \u2229 xC\nis not empty. Since B is self-linked, the intersection B \u2229 xB contains the coset\nbH = xb\u2032 H for some b, b\u2032 \u2208 B. It follows that b\u22121 xb\u2032 \u2208 H = AA\u22121 . The latter\nequality follows from the fact that the set A \u2282 H is self-linked in H. Consequently,\n\nb\u22121 xb\u2032 = a\u2032 a\u22121 for some a, a\u2032 \u2208 A. Then xC \u220b xb\u2032 a = ba\u2032 \u2208 C and thus C \u2229xC 6= \u2205.\nThe self-linkedness of C implies the desired upper bound\nsl(G) \u2264 |C| \u2264 |A| * |B| = sl(H) * sl(G/H).\n2b. Next, we show that sl(G/H) \u2264 \u2308(|G/H| + 1)/2\u2309. Take any subset A \u2282 G/H\nof size |A| = \u2308(|G/H| + 1)/2\u2309 and note that |A| > |G/H|/2. Then for each x \u2208 G\n\nthe shift xA has size |xA| = |A| > |G/H|/2. Since |A| + |xA| > |G/H|, the sets\nA and xA meet each other. Consequently, A is self-linked and sl(G/H) \u2264 |A| =\n\n\u2308(|G/H| + 1)/2\u2309.\n\n3. Pick a subset B \u2282 G of size |B| = |G/H| such that BH = G and observe that\nthe set A = H \u222a B is self-linked and has size |A| \u2264 |H| + |B| \u2212 1 (because B \u2229 H\nis a singleton).\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 1.2. For a finite group G\n(i) sl(G) = \u2308(|G| + 1)/2\u2309 > |G|/2 if and only if G is isomorphic to one of the\ngroups: C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C2 \u00d7 C2 , C5 , D6 , (C2 )3 ;\n\n(ii) sl(G) = |G|/2 if and only if G is isomorphic to one of the groups: C6 , C8 ,\nC4 \u00d7 C2 , D8 , Q8 .\nProof. I. First we establish the inequality sl(G) < |G|/2 for all groups G not iso-\n\nmorphic to the groups appearing in the items (i), (ii). Given such a group G we\nshould find a self-linked subset A \u2282 G with |A| < |G|/2.\nWe consider 8 cases.\n1) G contains a subgroup H of order |H| = 3 and index |G/H| = 3. Then\n\nsl(H) = 2 and we can apply Proposition 1.1(2) to conclude that\n\nsl(G) \u2264 sl(H) * sl(G/H) \u2264 2 * 2 < 9/2 = |G|/2.\n2) |G| \u2208\n/ {9, 12, 15} and G contains a subgroup H of order n = |H| \u2265 3 and index\n\nm = |G/H| \u2265 3. It this case n + m \u2212 1 < nm/2 and sl(G) \u2264 |H| + |G/H| \u2212 1 =\n\nn + m \u2212 1 < nm/2 by Proposition 1.1(3).\n3) G is cyclic of order n = |G| \u2265 9. Given a generator a of G, construct a\n\nsequence (xi )2\u2264i\u2264n/2 letting x2 = a0 , x3 = a, x4 = a3 , x5 = a5 , and xi = xi\u22121 ai\n\n\f6\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\nfor 5 < i \u2264 n/2. Then the set A = {xi : 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n/2} has size |A| < n/2 and is\n\nself-linked.\n4) G is cyclic of order |G| = 7. Given a generator a of G observe that A =\n\n{e, a, a3 } is a 3-element self-linked subset and thus sl(G) \u2264 3 < |G|/2.\n5) G contains a cyclic subgroup H \u2282 G of prime order |H| \u2265 7. By the preceding\n\n|G|\ntwo cases, sl(H) < |H|/2 and then sl(G) \u2264 sl(H) * sl(G/H) < |H|\n2 * |H| = |G|/2.\n6) |G| > 6 and |G| \u2208\n/ {8, 10, 12}. If |G| is prime or |G| = 15, then G is cyclic\n\nof order |G| \u2265 7 and thus has sl(G) < |G|/2 by the items (3), (4). If |G| = 2p for\nsome prime number p, then G contains a cyclic subgroup of order p \u2265 7 and thus\n\nhas sl(G) < |G|/2 by the item (5). If |G| = 4n for some n \u2265 4, then by Sylow's\nTheorem (see [OA, p.74]), G contains a subgroup H \u2282 G of order |H| = 4 and\nindex |G/H| \u2265 4. Then sl(G) < |G|/2 by the item (2). If the above conditions do\nnot hold, then |G| = nm 6= 15 for some odd numbers n, m \u2265 3 and we can apply\nthe items (1) and (2) to conclude that sl(G) < |G|/2.\n\n7) If |G| = 8, then G is isomorphic to one of the groups: C8 , C2 \u00d7 C4 , (C2 )3 ,\nD8 , Q8 . All those groups appear in the items (i), (ii) and thus are excluded from\nour consideration.\n8) If |G| = 10, then G is isomorphic to C10 or D10 . If G is isomorphic to C10 ,\n\nthen sl(G) < |G|/2 by the item (3). If G is isomorphic to D10 , then G contains\nan element a of order 5 and an element b of order 2 such that bab\u22121 = a\u22121 . Now\nit is easy to check that the 4-element set A = {e, a, b, ba2 } is self-linked and hence\nsl(G) \u2264 4 < |G|/2.\n\n9) In this item we consider groups G with |G| = 12. It is well-known that there\nare five non-isomorphic groups of order 12: the cyclic group C12 , the direct sum of\ntwo cyclic groups C6 \u2295 C2 , the dihedral group D12 , the alternating group A4 , and\nthe semidirect product C3 \u22ca C4 with presentation ha, b|a4 = b3 = 1, aba\u22121 = b\u22121 i.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C12 , C6 \u2295 C2 or A4 , then G contains a normal 4-element\nsubgroup H. By Sylow's Theorem, G contains also an element a of order 3. Taking\ninto account that a2 \u2208\n/ H and Ha\u22121 = a\u22121 H, we conclude that the 5-element set\n\nA = {a} \u222a H is self-linked and hence sl(G) \u2264 5 < |G|/2.\nIf G is isomorphic to C3 \u22ca C4 , then G contains a normal subgroup H of order\n3 and an element a \u2208 G such that a2 \u2208\n/ H. Observe that the 5-element set A =\n2\n\u22121\nH \u222a{a, a } is self-linked. Indeed, AA \u2283 H \u222aaH \u222aa2 H \u222aHa\u22121 = G. Consequently,\nsl(G) \u2264 5 < |G|/2.\nFinally, consider the case of the dihedral group D12 . It contains an element\n\na generating a cyclic subgroup of order 6 and an element b of order 2 such that\nbab\u22121 = a\u22121 . Consider the 5-element set A = {e, a, a3 , b, ba} and note that AA\u22121 =\n\n{e, a, a3 , b, ba} * {e, a5, a3 , b, ba} = G. This yields the desired inequality sl(G) \u2264 5 <\n6 = |G|/2.\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n7\n\nTherefore we have completed the proof of the inequality sl(G) < |G|/2 for all\n\ngroups not appearing in the items (i),(ii) of the theorem.\nII. Now we shall prove the item (i).\n\nThe lower bound from Proposition 1.1(1) implies that sl(G) = \u2308(|G| + 1)/2\u2309 >\n|G|/2 for all groups G with |G| \u2264 5.\n\nIt remains to check that sl(G) > |G|/2 if G is isomorphic to D6 or C23 . First we\nconsider the case G = D6 . In this case G contains a normal 3-element subgroup T .\nAssuming that sl(G) \u2264 |G|/2 = 3, find a self-linked 3-element subset A. Without\n\nloss of generality we can assume that the neutral element e of G belongs to A\n(otherwise replace A by a suitable shift xA). Taking into account that AA\u22121 = G,\n\nwe conclude that A 6\u2282 T and thus we can find an element a \u2208 A \\ T . This element\nhas order 2. Then\nAA\u22121 = {e, a, b} * {e, a, b\u22121 } = {e, a, b, a, e, ba, b\u22121, ba, e} =\n6 G,\nwhich is a contradiction.\nNow assume that G is isomorphic to C23 . In this case G is the 3-dimensional\nlinear space over the field C2 . Assuming that sl(A) \u2264 4 = |G|/2, find a 4-element\nself-linked subset A \u2282 G. Replacing A by a suitable shift, we can assume that\nA contains a neutral element e of G. Since AA\u22121 = G, the set A contains three\nlinearly independent points a, b, c. Then\nAA\u22121 = {e, a, b, c} * {e, a, b, c} = {e, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc} =\n6 G,\nwhich contradicts the choice of A.\nIII. Finally, we prove the equality sl(G) = |G|/2 for the groups appearing in the\nitem (ii).\nIf G = C6 , then sl(G) \u2265 3 by Proposition 1.1(1). On the other hand, we can\ncheck that for any generator a of G the 3-element subset A = {e, a, a3 } is self-linked\nin G, which yields sl(G) = 3 = |G|/2.\nIf |G| = 8, then sl(G) \u2265 4 by Proposition 1.1(1).\n\nIf G is cyclic of order 8 and a is a generator of G, then the set A = {e, a, a3 , a4 }\nis self-linked and thus sl(C8 ) = 4.\nIf G is isomorphic to C4 \u2295 C2 , then G has two commuting generators a, b such\nthat a4 = b2 = 1. One can check that the set A = {e, a, a2 , b} is self-linked and\n\nthus sl(C4 \u2295 C2 ) = 4.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8 , then G has two generators a, b\nconnected by the relations a4 = b2 = 1 and bab\u22121 = a\u22121 . One can check that the\n4-element subset A = {e, a, b, ba2} is self-linked.\n\n\f8\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the group Q8 = {\u00b11, \u00b1i, \u00b1j, \u00b1k} of quaternion units, then\n\nwe can check that the 4-element subset A = {\u22121, 1, i, j} is self-linked and thus\nsl(Q8 ) = 4.\n\u0003\nIn the following proposition we complete Theorem 1.2 calculating the values of\nthe cardinal sl(G) for all groups G of cardinality |G| \u2264 13.\nProposition 1.3. The number sl(G) for a group G of size |G| \u2264 13 can be found\nfrom the table:\nG\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nC5\n\nC4\n\nC2 \u2295 C2\n\nC6\n\nD6\n\nC8\n\nC2 \u2295 C4\n\nD8\n\nQ8\n\nC23\n\nsl(G)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\nG\n\nC7\n\nC11\n\nC13\n\nC9\n\nC3 \u2295 C3\n\nC10\n\nD10\n\nC12\n\nC2 \u2295 C6\n\nD12\n\nA4\n\nC3 \u22ca C4\n\nsl(G)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\nProof. For groups G of order\u221a|G| \u2264 10 the value of sl(G) is uniquely determined by\n\nthe lower bound sl(G) \u2265\n\n1+\n\n4|G|\u22123\n2\n\nfrom Proposition 1.1(1) and the upper bound\n\nfrom Theorem 1.2. It remains to consider the groups G of order 11 \u2264 |G| \u2264 13.\n1. If G is cyclic of order 11 or 13, then take a generator a of G and check that\n\nthe 4-element set A = {e, a4 , a5 , a7 } is self-linked, witnessing that sl(C12 ) = 4.\n2. If G is cyclic of order 12, then take a generator a for G and check that the\n4-element subset A = {e, a, a3 , a7 } is self-linked witnessing that sl(G) = 4.\nIt remains to consider all other groups of order 12. Theorem 1.2 gives us an\nupper bound sl(G) \u2264 5. So, we need to show that sl(G) > 4 for all non-cyclic\n\ngroups G with |G| = 12.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to C6 \u2295 C2 or A4 , then G contains a normal subgroup H\n\nisomorphic to C2 \u2295C2 . Assuming that sl(G) = 4, we can find a 4-element self-linked\nsubset A \u2282 G. Since AA\u22121 = G, we can find a suitable shift xA such that xA \u2229 H\n\ncontains the neutral element e of G and some other element a of H. Replacing A\nby xA, we can assume that e, a \u2208 A. Since A 6\u2282 H, there is a point b \u2208 A \\ H.\n\nSince the quotient group G/H has order 3, bH \u2229 Hb\u22121 = \u2205.\n\nConcerning the forth element c \u2208 A\\ {e, a, b} there are three possibilities: c \u2208 H,\nc \u2208 b\u22121 H, and c \u2208 bH. If c \u2208 H, then bH = bH \u2229 AA\u22121 = b(A \u2229 H)\u22121 consists of\n\n3 elements which is a contradiction. If c \u2208 b\u22121 H, then H = H \u2229 AA\u22121 = {e, a},\nwhich is absurd. So, c \u2208 bH and thus c = bh for some h \u2208 H. Since h = h\u22121 , we\n\nget cb\u22121 = bhb\u22121 = bh\u22121 b\u22121 = bc\u22121 . Then H = H \u2229 AA\u22121 = {e, a, cb\u22121 , bc\u22121 } has\ncardinality |H| = |{e, a, cb\u22121 = bc\u22121 }| \u2264 3, which is not true. This contradiction\ncompletes the proof of the inequality sl(G) > 4 for the groups C6 \u2295 C2 and A4 .\n\n4. Assume that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D12 . Then G contains\na normal cyclic subgroup H of order 6, and for each b \u2208 G \\ H and a \u2208 H we\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n9\n\nget b2 = e and bab\u22121 = a\u22121 . Assuming that sl(D12 ) = 4, we can find a 4element self-linked subset A \u2282 G. Let a be a generator of the group H. Since\na \u2208 AA\u22121 = G, we can find two element x, y \u2208 A such that a = xy \u22121 . Then the\n\nshift Ay \u22121 contains e and a. Replacing A by Ay \u22121 , if necessary, we can assume\nthat e, a \u2208 A. Since A 6\u2282 H, there is an element b \u2208 A \\ H. Concerning the\n\nforth element c \u2208 A \\ {e, a, b} there are two possibilities: c \u2208 H and c \u2208\n/ H. If\nc \u2208 H, then the set AH = A \u2229 H = {e, a, c} contains three elements and is equal\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nto bA\u22121\n, which implies bA\u22121\n= bA\u22121\n= AA\u22121 \u2229 bH = bH.\nH b\nH = AH b\nH \u222a AH b\nThis is a contradiction, because |H| = 4 > 3 = |bA\u22121\nH |. Then c \u2208 bH and hence\n\nH = H \u2229 AA\u22121 = {e, a, a\u22121 , bc\u22121 , cb\u22121 } which is not true because |H| = 6 > 5.\n\n5. Assume that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product C3 \u22ca C4 and hence\nhas a presentation ha, b|a4 = b3 = 1, aba\u22121 = b\u22121 i. Then the cyclic subgroup H\ngenerated by b is normal in G and the quotient G/H is cyclic of order 4. Assuming\nthat sl(G) = 4, take any 4-element self-linked subset A \u2282 G.\nAfter a suitable shift of A, we can assume that e, b \u2208 A. Since A 6\u2282 H, there is\n\nan element c \u2208 A \\ H. We claim that the fourth element d \u2208 A \\ {e, b, c} does not\nbelong to H \u222a cH \u222a c\u22121 H. Otherwise, AA\u22121 \u2282 H \u222a cH \u222a c\u22121 H 6= G. This implies\n\nthat one of the elements, say c belongs to the coset a2 H and the other to aH or\na\u22121 H. We lose no generality assuming that d \u2208 aH. Then c = a2 bi , d = abj for\nsome i, j \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}. It follows that\n\naH = aH \u2229AA\u22121 = {d, db\u22121 , cd\u22121 } = {abj , abj\u22121 , a2 bi\u2212j a\u22121 } = {abj , abj\u22121 , abj\u2212i }\nwhich implies that i = \u22121 and thus c = a2 b\u22121 . In this case we arrive to a contradiction looking at\n\na2 H \u2229 AA\u22121 = {c, cb\u22121 , c\u22121 , bc\u22121 } = {a2 b\u22121 , a2 b\u22122 , ba2 , b2 a2 } 6\u220b a2 .\n\u0003\nProblem 1.4.

Maximal invariant linked systems\nIn this section we study (maximal) invariant linked systems on groups. An\ninclusion hyperspace A on a group X is called invariant if xA = A for all x \u2208 X.\n\u2194\n\nThe set of all invariant inclusion hyperspaces on X is denoted by G(X). By [G2],\n\n\u2194\n\nG(X) is a closed rectangular subsemigroup of G(X) coinciding with the minimal\n\u2194\n\nideal of G(X). The rectangularity of G(X) means that A \u25e6 B = B for all A, B \u2208\n\n\u2194\n\nG(X).\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nLet N 2 (X) = N2 (X) \u2229 G(X) denote the set of all invariant linked systems on\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nX and \u03bb (X) = max N 2 (X) be the family of all maximal elements of N 2 (X).\n\n\f10\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\u2194\n\nElements of \u03bb (X) are called maximal invariant linked systems. The reader should\nbe concisions of the fact that maximal invariant linked systems need not be maximal\nlinked!\n\u2194\n\nTheorem 2.1. For every group X the set \u03bb (X) is a non-empty closed rectangular\nsubsemigroup of G(X).\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nProof. The rectangularity of \u03bb (X) implies from the rectangularity of G(X) estab\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nlished in [G2, \u00a75] and the inclusion \u03bb (X) \u2282 G(X).\n\nThe Zorn Lemma implies that each invariant linked system on X (in particular,\n{X}) can be enlarged to a maximal invariant linked system on X. This observation\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nimplies the set \u03bb (X) is not empty. Next, we show that the subsemigroup \u03bb (X)\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nis closed in G(X). Since the set N 2 (X) = N2 (X) \u2229 G(X) is closed in G(X), it\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nsuffices to show that \u03bb (X) is closed in N 2 (X). Take any invariant linked system\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nL \u2208 N 2 (X) \\ \u03bb (X). Being not maximal invariant, the linked system L can be\nenlarged to a maximal invariant linked system M that contains a subset B \u2208 M\\L.\n\nSince M \u220b B is invariant, the system {xB : x \u2208 X} \u2282 M is linked. Observe that\nB \u2208\n/ L and B \u2208 M \u2283 L implies X \\ B \u2208 L\u22a5 and B \u2208 L\u22a5 . We claim that\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nO(L) = B \u2212 \u2229 (X \\ B)\u2212 \u2229 N 2 (X) is a neighborhood of L in N 2 (X) that misses the\n\u2194\n\nset \u03bb (X). Indeed, for any A \u2208 O(L), we get that A is an invariant linked system\nsuch that B \u2208 A\u22a5 . Observe that for every x \u2208 X and A \u2208 A we get x\u22121 A \u2208 A by\nthe invariantness of A and hence the set B \u2229 x\u22121 A and its shift xB \u2229 A both are not\n\nempty. This witnesses that xB \u2208 A\u22a5 for every x \u2208 X. Then the maximal invariant\nlinked system generated by A \u222a {xB : x \u2208 X} is an invariant linked enlargement of\nA, which shows that A is not maximal invariant linked.\n\u0003\n\u2194\n\nNext, we shall evaluate the cardinality of \u03bb (X).\n\u2194\n\nTheorem 2.2.

Since U, V are\n\u03ba-uniform, |U | = |V | = \u03ba.\nFor every \u03b1 < \u03ba consider the sets U\u03b1 = {a\u03b2 \u2208 U : \u03b2 > \u03b1} \u2208 U and V\u03b1 = {a\u03b2 \u2208\nV : \u03b2 > \u03b1} \u2208 V.\nIt is clear that\n\nFU =\n\n[\n\u03b1<\u03ba\n\nx\u03b1 U\u03b1 \u2208 FU and FV =\n\n[\n\u03b1<\u03ba\n\nx\u03b1 V\u03b1 \u2208 FV .\n\nLet us show that FU \u2229 FV = \u2205. Otherwise there would exist two ordinals \u03b1, \u03b2\nand points u \u2208 U\u03b1 , v \u2208 V\u03b2 such that x\u03b1 u = x\u03b2 v. It follows from u 6= v that \u03b1 6= \u03b2.\n\nWrite the points u, v as u = a\u03b3 and v = a\u03b4 for some \u03b3 > \u03b1 and \u03b4 > \u03b2. Then we\nhave the equality x\u03b1 a\u03b3 = x\u03b2 a\u03b4 . The inequality u 6= vimplies that \u03b3 6= \u03b4. We lose\n\nno generality assuming that \u03b4 > \u03b3. Then\n\n\u22121\na\u03b4 = x\u22121\n\u03b2 x\u03b1 a\u03b3 \u2208 B\u03b4 B\u03b4 A<\u03b4\n\nwhich contradicts the choice of a\u03b4 .\nTherefore, FU \u2229FV = \u2205. Taking into account that the linked systems LU \u2283 FU \u220b\n\nFU and LV \u2283 FV \u220b FV contain disjoint sets FU , FV , we conclude that LU 6= LV .\nConsequently,\n\u2194\n\n\u03ba\n\n| \u03bb (X)| \u2265 |{LU : U \u2208 U\u03ba (A)}| = |U\u03ba (A)| = 22 .\n\u0003\n\u2194\n\nThe preceding theorem implies that | \u03bb (G)| = 2c for any countable group G.\n\u2194\n\nNext, we evaluate the cardinality of \u03bb (G) for finite groups G.\n\nGiven a finite group G consider the invariant linked system\nL0 = {A \u2282 X : 2|A| > |G|}\nand the subset\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2191L0 = {A \u2208 \u03bb (G) : A \u2283 L0 }\n\nof \u03bb (G).\n\u2194\n\nProposition 2.3. Let G be a finite group. If sl(G) \u2265 |G|/2, then \u03bb (G) = \u2191L0 .\n\n\f12\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\u2194\n\nProof. We should prove that each maximal invariant linked system A \u2208 \u03bb (G)\ncontains L0 . Take any set L \u2208 L0 . Taking into account that sl(G) \u2265 |G|/2 and\neach set A \u2208 A is self-linked, we conclude that |A| \u2265 |G|/2 and hence A intersects\n\neach shift xL of L (because |A| + |xL| > |G|). Since the set L is self-linked, we get\nthat the invariant linked system A \u222a {xL : x \u2208 G} is equal to A by the maximality\n\nof A. Consequently, L \u2208 A and hence L0 \u2282 A.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn light of Proposition 2.3 it is important to evaluate the cardinality of the set\n\u2191L0 . In |G| is odd, then the invariant linked system L0 is maximal linked and thus\n\u2191L0 is a singleton. The case of even |G| is less trivial.\nGiven an group G of finite even order |G|, consider the family\nS = {A \u2282 G : AA\u22121 = G, |A| = |G|/2}\nof self-linked subsets A \u2282 G of cardinality |A| = |G|/2. On the family S consider\n\nthe equivalence relation \u223c letting A \u223c B for A, B \u2208 S if there is x \u2208 G such that\nA = xB or X \\ A = xB. Let S/\u223c the quotient set of S by this equivalence relation\nand s = |S/\u223c | stand for the cardinality of S/\u223c .\n\u2194\n\nProposition 2.4. | \u03bb (G)| \u2265 |\u2191L0 | = 2s .\nProof. First we show that \u223c indeed is an equivalence relation on S. So, assume\nthat S 6= \u2205. Let us show that G \\ A \u2208 S for every A \u2208 S. Let B = G \\ A. Assuming\n\nthat B \u2208\n/ S, we conclude that B \u2229 xB = \u2205 for some x \u2208 G. Since |B| = |A| = |G|/2,\nwe conclude that xB = A and G \\ A = B = x\u22121 A. The equality A \u2229 x\u22121 A = \u2205\nimplies x\u22121 \u2208\n/ AA\u22121 = G, which is a contradiction.\nTaking into account that A = eA for every A \u2208 S, we conclude that \u223c is a\n\nreflexive relation on S. If A \u223c B, then there is x \u2208 X such that A = xB or\nG \\ A = xB. This implies that B = x\u22121 A or X \\ B = x\u22121 A, that is B \u223c A and\n\u223c is symmetric. It remains to prove that the relation \u223c is transitive on S. So let\nA \u223c B \u223c C. This means that there exist x, y \u2208 G such that A = xB or G \\ A = xB\n\nand B = yC or G \\ B = yC. It is easy to check that in these cases A = xyC or\nX \\ A = xyC.\nChoose a subset T of S intersecting each equivalence class of \u223c at a single point.\n\nObserve that |T | = |S/\u223c | = s. Now for every function f : T \u2192 2 = {0, 1} consider\nthe maximal invariant linked system\nLf = L0 \u222a {xT : x \u2208 G, T \u2208 f \u22121 (0)} \u222a {x(G \\ T ) : x \u2208 G, T \u2208 f \u22121 (1)}.\nIt can be shown that\n|\u2191L0 | = |{Lf : f \u2208 2T }| = 2|T | = 2s .\n\u0003\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n13\n\u2194\n\nThis proposition will help us to calculate the cardinality of the set \u03bb (G) for all\nfinite groups G of order |G| \u2264 8:\n\u2194\n\nTheorem 2.5.

We divide the proof into 5 cases.\n1. If sl(G) > |G|/2, then L0 is a unique maximal invariant linked system and\n\u2194\n\nthus | \u03bb (X)| = 1. By Theorem 1.2, sl(G) > |G|/2 if and only if |G| \u2264 5 or G is\nisomorphic to D6 or C23 .\n\u2194\n\n2. If sl(G) = |G|/2, then | \u03bb (G)| = 2s where s = |S/\u223c |. So it remains to calculate\nthe number s for the groups C6 , D8 , C4 \u2295 C2 , C8 , and Q8 .\n\n2a. If G is cyclic of order 6, then we can take any generator a on G and by\nroutine calculations, check that\nS = {xT, x(G \\ T ) : x \u2208 G}\nwhere T = {e, a, a3 }. It follows that s = |S/\u223c | = 1 and thus\n\u2194\n\n| \u03bb (G)| = |\u2191L0 | = 2s = 2.\n2b. If G is cyclic of order 8, then we can take any generator a on G and by\nroutine verification check that\nS = {xA, G \\ xA, xB, G \\ xB, C, G \\ xC : x \u2208 G}\nwhere A = {e, a, a2 , a4 }, B = {e, a, a2 , a5 }, and C = {e, a, a3 , a5 }. It follows that\n\ns = |S/\u223c | = 3 and thus\n\n\u2194\n\n| \u03bb (G)| = |\u2191L0 | = 2s = 8.\n\n2c. Assume that the group G is isomorphic to C4 \u2295 C2 and let G2 = {x \u2208 G :\n\nxx = e} be the Boolean subgroup of G. We claim that a 4-element subset A \u2282 G\nis self-linked if and only if |A \u2229 G2 | is odd.\n\nTo prove the \"if\" part of this claim, assume that |A \u2229 G2 | = 3. We claim\nthat A is self-linked. Let A2 = A \u2229 G2 and note that G2 = A2 A\u22121\n\u2282 AA\u22121\n2\n\nbecause |A2 | = 3 > 2 = |G2 |/2. Now take any element a \u2208 A \\ G2 and note that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nAA\u22121 \u2283 aA\u22121\n. Observe that both aA\u22121\n= a\u22121 A2 are\n2 \u222a A2 a\n2 = aA2 and A2 a\n3-element subsets in the 4-element coset aG2 . Those 3-element sets are different.\n\nIndeed, assuming that aA\u22121\n= A2 a\u22121 we would obtain that a2 A2 = A2 which\n2\n\u22121\nimplies that |A2 | = 3 is even. Consequently, aG2 = aA\u22121\n\u2282 AA\u22121 and\n2 \u222a A2 a\nfinally G = AA\u22121 .\n\n\f14\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\nIf |A \u2229 G2 | = 1, then we can take any a \u2208 A \\ G2 and consider the shift Aa\u22121\n\nwhich has |Aa\u22121 \u2229G2 | = 3. Then the preceding case implies that Aa\u22121 is self-linked\nand so is A.\nTo prove the \"only if\" part of the claim assume that |A\u2229G2 | is even. If |A\u2229G2 | =\n4, then A = G2 and AA\u22121 = G2 G\u22121\n2 = G2 6= G. If |A \u2229 G2 | = 0, then A = G2 a\nfor any a \u2208 A and hence AA\u22121 = G2 aa\u22121 G\u22121\n2 = G2 6= G. If |A \u2229 G2 | = 2, then\n|G2 \u2229 AA\u22121 | \u2264 3 and again AA\u22121 6= G.\nThus\n\nS = {A \u2282 G : |A| = 4 and |A \u2229 G2 | is odd}.\nEach set A \u2208 S has a unique shift aA with aA \u2229 G2 = {e}. There are exactly four\n\nsubsets A \u2208 S with A \u2229 G2 = {e} forming two equivalence classes with respect to\nthe relation \u223c. Therefore s = 2 and\n\u2194\n\n| \u03bb (G)| = |\u2191L0 | = 2s = 4.\n2d. Assume that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8 of isometries of\nthe square. Then G contains an element a of order 4 generating a normal cyclic\nsubgroup H. The element a2 commutes with all the elements of the group G.\nWe claim that for each self-linked 4-element subset A \u2282 G we get |A \u2229 H| = 2.\nIndeed, if |A \u2229 H| equals 0 or 4, then A = Hb for some b \u2208 G and then AA\u22121 =\nAbb\u22121 A\u22121 = H 6= G. If |A \u2229 H| equals 1 or 3, then replacing A by a suitable\n\nshift, we can assume that A \u2229 H = {e} and hence A = {e} \u222a B for some 3-element\nsubset B \u2282 G \\ H. It follows that G \\ H = AA\u22121 \\ H = (B \u222a B \u22121 ) = B 6= G \\ H.\nThis contradiction shows that |A \u2229 H| = 2. Without loss of generality, we can\n\nassume that A \u2229 H = {e, a2 } (if it is not the case, replace A by its shift Ax\u22121 where\nx, y \u2208 A are such that yx\u22121 = a2 ). Now take any element b \u2208 A \\ H. Since G is not\ncommutative, we get ab = ba3 . Observe that ba2 \u2208\n/ A (otherwise A = {e, b, a2, ba2 }\nwould be a subgroup of G with AA\u22121 = A 6= G). Consequently, the 4-th element\n\nc \u2208 A \\ {e, a2 , b} of A should be of the form c = ba or c = ba3 = ab. Observe that\nboth the sets A1 = {e, a2 , b, ba} and A2 = {e, a2 , b, ab} are self-linked. Observe also\nthat\n\na3 (G \\ A1 ) = a3 * {a, a3 , ba2 , ba3 } = {e, a2 , ab, b} = A2 .\n\u2194\n\nConsequently, s = |S/\u223c | = 1 and | \u03bb (G)| = 2s = 2.\n\n2e. Finally assume that G is isomorphic to the group Q8 = {\u00b11, \u00b1i, \u00b1j, \u00b1k} of\nquaternion units. The two-element subset H = {\u22121, 1} is a normal subgroup in X.\n\nLet S\u00b1 = {A \u2208 S : H \u2282 A} and observe that each set A \u2208 S has a left shift in\n\nS. Take any set A \u2208 S\u00b1 and pick a point a \u2208 A \\ {1, \u22121}. Observe that the 4-th\nelement b \u2208 A \\ {1, \u22121, a} of A is not equal to \u2212a (otherwise, A is a subgroup of\nG).\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n15\n\nConversely, one can easily check that each set A = {1, \u22121, a, b} with a, b \u2208 G \\ H\n\nand a 6= \u2212b is self-linked. This means that\n\nS\u00b1 = {{\u22121, 1, a, b} : a 6= \u2212b and a, b \u2208 G \\ H}\nand thus |S\u00b1 | = C62 \u2212 3 = 12. Observe that for each A \u2208 S2 the set \u2212A \u2208 S2\nand there axactly two shifts of X \\ A that belong to S2 . This means that the\n\nequivalence class [A]\u223c of any set A \u2208 S intersects S2 in four sets. Consequently,\ns = |S/\u223c | = |S\u00b1 |/4 = 12/4 = 3 and\n\u2194\n\n| \u03bb (G)| = |\u2191L0 | = 2s = 8.\n\n\u2194\n\n3. If |G| = 7, then L0 is one of three elements of \u03bb (G). The other two elements\n\ncan be found as follows. Consider the invariant linked system\nL1 = {A \u2282 G : |A| \u2265 5}\n\u2194\n\nand observe that L1 \u2282 A for each A \u2208 \u03bb (G). Indeed, assuming that some A \u2208 L1\n\ndoes not belong to A, we would conclude that B = G \\ A \u2208 A by the maximality\nof A. Since |G \\ B| \u2264 2 we can find x \u2208 G \\ BB \u22121 . It follows that B, xB are two\n\ndisjoint sets in A which is not possible. Thus L1 \u2282 A.\nObserve that L1 \u2282 A \u2282 L0 \u222a L3 , where\n\nL3 = {A \u2282 G : |A| = 3, AA\u22121 = G}.\nGiven a generator a of the cyclic group G, consider the 3-element set T = {a, a2 , a4 }\nand note that T T \u22121 = G and T \u22121 \u2229 T = \u2205. By a routine calculation, one can check\nthat\n\nL3 = {xT, xT \u22121 : x \u2208 G}.\n\nSince T and T \u22121 are disjoint, the invariant linked system A cannot contain both\n\nthe sets T and T \u22121 . If A contains none of the sets T, T \u22121 , then A = L0 . If A\ncontains T , then\n\nA = (L0 \u222a {xT : x \u2208 G}) \\ {y(G \\ T ) : y \u2208 G}.\nIf T \u22121 \u2208 A, then\nA = (L0 \u222a {xT \u22121 : x \u2208 G}) \\ {y(G \\ T \u22121 ) : y \u2208 G}.\n\u2194\n\nAnd those are the unique 3 maximal invariant systems in \u03bb (G).\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the following theorem we characterize groups possessing a unique maximal\ninvariant linked system.\nTheorem 2.6. For a finite group G the following conditions are equivalent:\n\u2194\n\n(1) | \u03bb (G)| = 1;\n\n(2) sl(G) > |G|/2;\n\n\f16\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\n(3) |G| \u2264 5 or else G is isomorphic to D6 or C23 .\nProof. (2) \u21d2 (1). If sl(G) > |G|/2, then L0 = {A \u2282 G : |A| > |G|/2} is a unique\nmaximal invariant linked system on G (because invariant linked systems compose\nof self-linked sets).\n(1) \u21d2 (2) Assume that sl(G) \u2264 |G|/2 and take a self-linked subset A \u2282 G with\n\n|A| \u2264 |G|/2. If |G| is odd, then L0 is maximal linked and then any maximal invariant linked system A containing the self-linked set A is distinct from L0 , witnessing\n\u2194\n\nthat | \u03bb (G)| > 1.\nIf G is even, then we can enlarge A, if necessary, and assume that |A| = |G|/2.\n\nWe claim that the complement B = G \\ A of A is self-linked too. Assuming the\nconverse, we would find some x \u2208\n/ BB \u22121 and conclude that B \u2229 xB = \u2205, which\nimplies that A = G \\ B = xB and hence x\u22121 A = B. Then the sets A and x\u22121 A are\n\ndisjoint which contradicts x\u22121 \u2208 AA\u22121 = G. Thus BB \u22121 = G which implies that\n{xB : x \u2208 G} is an invariant linked system. Since |G| = 2|A| is even, the unions\n\nA = {xA : x \u2208 G} \u222a L0 and B = {xB : x \u2208 G} \u222a L0 are invariant linked systems\nthat can be enlarged to maximal linked systems \u00c3 and B\u0303, respectively. Since the\n\nsets A \u2208 A \u2282 \u00c3 and B \u2208 B \u2282 B\u0303 are disjoint, \u00c3 6= B\u0303 are two distinct maximal\n\u2194\n\ninvariant systems on G and thus | \u03bb (G)| \u2265 2.\n\nThe equivalence (2) \u21d4 (3) follows from Theorem 1.2(i).\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Right zeros in \u03bb(X)\nIn this section we return to studying the superextensions of groups and shall\ndetect groups X whose superextensions \u03bb(X) have right zeros. We shall show that\nfor every group X the right zeros of \u03bb(X) coincide with invariant maximal linked\nsystems.\nWe recall that an element z of a semigroup S is called a right (resp. left) zero in\nS if xz = z (resp. zx = z) for every x \u2208 S. This is equivalent to saying that the\nsingleton {x} is a left (resp. right) ideal of S.\n\nBy [G2, 5.1] an inclusion hyperspace A \u2208 G(X) is a right zero in G(X) if and\nonly if A is invariant. This implies that the minimal ideal of the semigroup G(X)\n\u2194\n\ncoincides with the set G(X) of invariant inclusion hyperspaces and is a compact\n\nrectangular topological semigroup. We recall that a semigroup S is called rectangular if xy = y for all x, y \u2208 S.\nA similar characterization of right zeros holds also for the semigroup \u03bb(X).\n\nProposition 3.1. A maximal linked system L is a right zero of the semigroup\n\u03bb(X) if and only if L is invariant.\nProof. If L is invariant, then by proposition 5.1 of [G2], L is a right zero in G(X)\n\nand consequently, a right zero in \u03bb(X).\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n17\n\nAssume conversely that L is a right zero in \u03bb(X). Then for every x \u2208 X we get\n\nxL = L, which means that L is invariant.\n\n\u0003\n\nUnlike the semigroup G(X) which always contains right zeros, the semigroup\n\u03bb(X) contains right zeros only for so-called odd groups. We define a group X to be\nodd if each element x \u2208 X has odd order. We recall that the order of an element\n\nx is the smallest integer number n \u2265 1 such that xn coincides with the neutral\nelement e of X.\nTheorem 3.2. For a group X the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) the semigroup \u03bb(X) has a right zero;\n(2) some maximal invariant linked system on X is maximal linked (which can\n\u2194\n\nbe written as \u03bb (X) \u2229 \u03bb(X) 6= \u2205);\n\n(3) each maximal invariant linked system is maximal linked (which can be writ\u2194\n\nten as \u03bb (X) \u2282 \u03bb(X));\n\n(4) for any partition X = A \u222a B either AA\u22121 = X or BB \u22121 = X;\n(5) each element of X has odd order.\n\nProof. The equivalence (1) \u21d4 (2) follows from Proposition 3.1.\n\n(2) \u21d2 (4) Assume that \u03bb(X) contains an invariant maximal linked system A.\n\nGiven any partition X = A1 \u222a A2 , use the maximality of A to find i \u2208 {1, 2} with\nAi \u2208 A. We claim that Ai A\u22121\n= X.

Indeed, for every A \u2208 A and x \u2208 X we get\nxZ \u25e6 A = Z \u25e6 A, which means that Z \u25e6 A is an invariant maximal linked system. By\nProposition 3.1, Z \u25e6 A is a right zero and hence Z \u25e6 A = Z because Z is a unique\nright zero.

The superextensions of finite groups\nIn this section we shall describe the structure of the superextensions \u03bb(G) of\nfinite groups G of small cardinality (more precisely, of cardinality |G| \u2264 5). It is\nknown that the cardinality of \u03bb(G) growth very quickly as |G| tends to infinity.\n\nThe calculation of the cardinality of |\u03bb(G)| seems to be a difficult combinatorial\n\nproblem related to the still unsolved Dedekind's problem of calculation of the number M (n) of inclusion hyperpspaces on an n-element subset, see [De]. We were able\nto calculate the cardinalities of \u03bb(G) only for groups G of cardinality |G| \u2264 6. The\nresults of (computer) calculations are presented in the following table:\n|G| 1\n\n|\u03bb(G)|\n|\u03bb(G)/G|\n\n1\n1\n\n2 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2 4\n1 2\n\n12 81 2646\n3 17 447\n\nBefore describing the structure of superextensions of finite groups, let us make\nsome remarks concerning the structure of a semigroup S containing a group G. In\nthis case S can be thought as a G-space endowed with the left action of the group\nG. So we can consider the orbit space S/G = {Gs : s \u2208 S} and the projection\n\n\fALGEBRA IN SUPEREXTENSIONS OF GROUPS, I\n\n21\n\n\u03c0 : S \u2192 S/G. If G lies in the center of the semigroup S (which means that the\n\nelements of G commute with all the elements of S), then the orbit space S/G admits\na unique semigroup operation turning S/G into a semigroup and the orbit projection\n\u03c0 : S \u2192 S/G into a semigroup homomorphism. A subsemigroup T \u2282 S will be\ncalled a transversal semigroup if the restriction \u03c0 : T \u2192 S/G is an isomorphism of\n\nthe semigroups. If S admits a transversal semigroup T , then it is a homomoprhic\nimage of the product G \u00d7 T under the semigroup homomorphism\nh : G \u00d7 T \u2192 S, h : (g, t) 7\u2192 gt.\nThis helps to recover the algebraic structure of S from the structure of a transversal\nsemigroup.\nFor a system B of subsets of a set X by\nhBi = {A \u2282 X : \u2203B \u2208 B (B \u2282 A)}\nwe denote the inclusion hyperspace generated by B.\nNow we shall analyse the entries of the above table. First note that each group\n\nG of size |G| \u2264 5 is abelian and is isomorphic to one of the groups: C1 , C2 , C3 ,\nC4 , C2 \u2295 C2 , C5 .

For the group C3 the semigroup \u03bb(C3 ) contains the\nthree principal ultrafilters 1, z, \u2212z where z = e2\u03c0i/3 and the maximal linked inclusion hyperspace \u22b2 = h{1, z}, {1, \u2212z}, {z, \u2212z}i which is the zero in \u03bb(C3 ). The\nsuperextension \u03bb(C3 ) is isomorphic to the multiplicative semigroup C30 = {z \u2208 C :\n\nz 4 = z} of the complex plane. The latter semigroup has zero 0 and unit 1 which\nare the unique idempotents.\nThe transversal semigroup \u03bb(C3 )/C3 is isomorphic to the semilattice 2 = {0, 1}\nendowed with the min-operation.\n6.3.

This is not occasional.\nProposition 6.2. The semigroup \u03bb(C5 ) contains no transversal semigroup.\nProof. Assume conversely that \u03bb(C5 ) contains a subsemigroup T that projects bijectively onto the orbit semigroup \u03bb(C5 )/C5 . Then T must include the set E(\u03bb(C5 ))\np\n\u221a\nof idempotents and also the subset E(\u03bb(C5 )) \\ Z.

This contradiction completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nAnalysing the Cayley table for the set T17 we can establish the following properties of the semigroup \u03bb(C5 ).\nProposition 6.3.\n\n(1) The maximal linked system Z is the zero of \u03bb(Z).\n\n(2) \u03bb(C5 ) contains 5 idempotents: U, Z, \u039b4 , \u039b, 2\u039b, which commute.\n(3) The set of central elements of \u03bb(C5 ) coincides with C5 \u222a {Z}.\n(4) All non-trivial subgroups of \u03bb(C5 ) are isomorphic to C5 .\n\n\f26\n\nT.BANAKH, V.GAVRYLKIV, O.NYKYFORCHYN\n\n6.5.
