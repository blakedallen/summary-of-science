Let P be a random 0/1-polytope in Rd with n(d) vertices,\nand denote by \u03c6k (P ) the k-face density of P , \u0001i.e., the quotient of the\nnumber of k-dimensional faces of P and n(d)\n. For each k \u2265 2, we\nk+1\nestablish the existence of a sharp threshold for the k-face density and\ndetermine the values of the threshold numbers \u03c4k such that, for all \u03b5 > 0,\n(\n1 \u2212 o(1) if n(d) \u2264 2(\u03c4k \u2212\u03b5)d for all d\nE [\u03c6k (P )] =\no(1)\nif n(d) \u2265 2(\u03c4k +\u03b5)d for all d\nholds for the expected value of \u03c6k (P ). The threshold for k = 1 has\nrecently been determined in [1].\nIn particular, these results indicate that the high face densities often\nencountered in polyhedral combinatorics (e.g., for the cut-polytopes of\ncomplete graphs) should be considered more as a phenomenon of the\ngeneral geometry of 0/1-polytopes than as a feature of the special combinatorics of the underlying problems.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and Results\n\nOver the last decades, investigations of various special classes of 0/1-polytopes\n(convex hulls of sets of 0/1-points) have not only lead to beautiful structural\nresults on combinatorial optimization problems, but also to powerful algorithms.\nConsequently, there has been some effort to learn more about the general class\nof 0/1-polytopes (see [2]).\nIn the 1980's, e.g., several results on the graphs of 0/1-polytopes have been\nobtained, most notably Naddef's proof [3] showing that they satisfy the Hirschconjecture. A quite spectacular achievement in 2000 was B\u00e1r\u00e1ny and P\u00f3r's theorem [4] stating that random 0/1-polytopes (within a certain range of vertex\nnumbers) have super-exponentially (in the dimension) many facets. Their proof\n\u22c6\n\nThis work was done while the author was a member of the Mathematical Sciences\nResearch Institute at Berkeley, CA, during Oct/Nov 2003.\n\n\fis based on the methods developed in the early 1990's by Dyer, F\u00fcredi, and McDiarmid [5], in order to show that the expected volume of a random d-dimensional\n0/1-polytope with n vertices drops from (almost) zero to (almost) one very\nquickly with n passing the threshold 2(1\u2212(log e)/2)d .\nWhile B\u00e1r\u00e1ny and P\u00f3r's result sheds some light on the highest-dimensional\nfaces of random 0/1-polytopes, we investigate their lower dimensional faces in\nthis paper. For a polytope P with n vertices and some k \u2208 [dim P ] (with [a] :=\n{1, 2, . . . , \u230aa\u230b}), we call\nfk (P )\n\u0001\n\u03c6k (P ) :=\nn\nk+1\n\nthe k-face density of P , where fk (P ) is the number of k-dimensional faces of P .\nClearly, we have 0 < \u03c6k (P ) \u2264 1, and \u03c6k (P ) = 1 holds if and only if P is\n(k + 1)-neighbourly in the usual polytope theoretical sense (see, e.g., [6]).\nThe 1-face density \u03c61 (P ) is the density of the graph of P . In this case, a\nthreshold result for random 0/1-polytopes has recently been obtained in [1].\nHowever, for specific classes of 0/1-polytopes, high k-face densities have been\nobserved also for larger values of k. For example, the cut-polytopes of complete\ngraphs have 2-face density equal to one (and thus, also 1-face density equal to\none), i.e., every triple of vertices makes a triangle-face\n(see [7,8]). Note that the\n\u221a\ncut-polytopes of complete graphs have 2\u0398( d) vertices.\nHere, we obtain that there is a sharp threshold for the k-face density of\nrandom 0/1-polytopes for all (fixed) k. The threshold values nicely extend the\nresults for k = 1, while the proof becomes more involved and needs a heavier\nmachinery (the one developed in the above mentioned paper by Dyer, F\u00fcredi,\nand McDiarmid). As a pay-back, the proof, however, reveals several interesting\ninsights into the geometry of (random) 0/1-polytopes.\n1.1\n\nResults\n\nLet us fix some k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . }, set r := k + 1, and let n : N \u2192 N be a function\n(with n(d) \u2208 [2d ]).\nDefine\nVd := {0, 1}d\n\nand\n\nQd := [0, 1]d = conv Vd ,\n\nand consider the following two models of random 0/1-polytopes.\nFor the first one, choose W uniformly at random from the n(d)-element\nsubsets of Vd , and define P1 := conv W . This is the model referred to in the\nabstract.\nFor the second one, choose S1 , . . . , Sr , X1 , . . . , Xn(d)\u2212r \u2208 Vd independently\nuniformly at random, and define\nS := {S1 , . . . , Sr } ,\n\nX := {X1 , . . . , Xn(d)\u2212r } ,\n\nP2 := conv (X \u222a S) .\n\nThe main part of the paper will be concerned with the proof of a threshold\n1\nresult (Theorem 1) within the second model. If, for some \u03b5 > 0, n(d) \u2264 2( 2 \u2212\u03b5)d\n\n\fholds for all d, then S1 , . . . , Sr , X1 , . . . , Xn(d)\u2212r are pairwise different with high\nprobability:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP |S \u222a X| = n(d) = 1 \u2212 o(1)\n(1)\n\nThis will allow us to deduce from Theorem 1 the threshold result within the first\nmodel promised in the abstract.\nThroughout the paper, log(*) and ln(*) will denote the binary and the natural\nlogarithm, respectively. For 0 < \u03be < 1, define\nh(\u03be) := \u03be log\n\n1\n1\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03be) log\n\u03be\n1\u2212\u03be\n\n(i.e., h(*) is the binary entropy function). Let us define\nX \u0012r \u0013 i \u0001\n1\nh\nHr := r\n2 \u22122\ni\nr\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\nand\n\u03c4\u0303r = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 21\u2212r )Hr .\nNote that we have H2 = 1 and 0 < Hr < 1 for r \u2265 3.\nTheorem 1. Let r \u2208 {3, 4, . . . } and \u03b5 > 0.\n1. If n(d) \u2264 2(\u03c4\u0303r \u2212\u03b5)d holds for all d, then we have\n\nP [conv S is a face of P2 ] = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n2. If n(d) \u2265 2(\u03c4\u0303r +\u03b5)d holds for all d, then we have\n\nP [P2 \u2229 aff S is a face of P2 ] = o(1) .\nFrom the evolution result on the density of the graphs of random 0/1polytopes obtained in [1] one readily derives that the statement of Theorem 1 is\nalso true for r = 2 (note \u03c4\u03032 = 21 ).\nUsing Theorem 1 (for r \u2208 {2, 3, . . . }), we can now prove the main result of\nthe paper, where for k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . } we denote\n\u03c4k := \u03c4\u0303k+1 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u2212k )Hk+1 .\nTheorem 2. Let k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . }, \u03b5 > 0, and n : N \u2192 N be any function. For\neach d \u2208 N, choose an n(d)-element subset W of {0, 1}d uniformly at random,\nand set P := conv W . Then\n(\n1 \u2212 o(1) if n(d) \u2264 2(\u03c4k \u2212\u03b5)d for all d\nE [\u03c6k (P )] =\no(1)\nif n(d) \u2265 2(\u03c4k +\u03b5)d for all d\nholds for the expected k-face density of P .\n\n\fFig. 1. The values \u03c4k for k \u2265 1 and 1 \u2212 Hr (see Proposition 1) for r \u2265 2.\nProof. Let us first consider the case n(d) \u2264 2(\u03c4k \u2212\u03b5)d . We adopt the notation\nintroduced in order to describe the first random model; in particular, P1 = P =\nconv W . Since r = k + 1 is constant, S (from the second random model) will\nconsist of k+1 affinely independent points with (very) high probability for large d\n(see [9]). Thus, the first part of Theorem 1 here implies\n\nP [conv S is a k-dimensional face of P2 ] = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\nDue to (1) (note \u03c4k \u2264 21 ), this yields\n\nP [conv T is a k-dimensional face of P1 ] = 1 \u2212 o(1)\nfor T chosen uniformly at random from the (k + 1)-subsets of (the random n(d)set) W . But this probability obviously is a lower bound for E [\u03c6k (P1 )], which\nproves the first part of the theorem.\nNow, we consider the case n(d) \u2265 2(\u03c4k +\u03b5)d . Similarly to the first case, the\nsecond part of Theorem 1 here implies\n\u0003\n\u0002\nP P2 \u2229 aff S is a face of P2 |S| = k + 1 = o(1) .\n(2)\nFurthermore, it is easy to see that\n\nP P2 \u2229 aff S is a face of P2 |S \u222a X| = n(d)\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2264 P P2 \u2229 aff S is a face of P2 |S| = k + 1 (3)\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\nholds. From (2) and (3) one readily deduces\n\nP [P1 \u2229 aff T is a face of P1 ] = o(1)\nfor T again chosen uniformly at random from the (k + 1)-subsets of W . Since\nthe number of k-faces of a polytope is at most the number of (k + 1)-subsets of\nits vertex set for which the intersections of their affine hulls and the polytope\nare faces of the polytope, the latter probability is an upper bound for E [\u03c6k (P1 )].\nThis proves the second part of the theorem.\n\n\f1.2\n\nOverview of the proof of Theorem 1\n\nThe structure of the proof is as follows: First, we will (in Section 2) reduce the\nproof of Theorem 1 to a statement (Proposition 1) about the event that S is not\ncontained in a proper face of the cube, i.e., S is spanning. (A proper face of a\npolytope is any face that is not the entire polytope, which is considered a face\nof itself here.) This statement finally is proved in Section 5. There we need the\nresults of Section 3 (for treating the cases behind the threshold) and Section 4\n(for the cases below the threshold).\nWe will use only basic facts from polytope theory (such as in the proof of\nTheorem 2).

Thus, for some function n : N \u2192 N, we choose the points S1 , . . . , Sr , X1 , . . . , Xn(d)\u2212r \u2208 Vd independently uniformly at random, and let S := {S1 , . . . , Sr }, X := {X1 , . . . , Xn(d)\u2212r },\nand P := conv (X \u222a S). Denote by F (S) the smallest face of the cube Qd that\ncontains S. Clearly, P \u2229 F (S) is a face of P . Let d(S) be the dimension of F (S)\n(i.e., d(S) is the number of coordinates where not all elements of S agree). If\nF (S) = Qd (i.e., d(S) = d), then we call S spanning.\nIn Section 5, we will prove the following result (where \u2202 denotes the boundary\noperator).\nProposition 1. Let r \u2208 {3, 4, . . . } and \u03b5 > 0.\n1. If n(d) \u2264 2(1\u2212Hr \u2212\u03b5)d holds for all d, then we have\n\nP [conv S is a face of P | S is spanning] = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n2. If n(d) \u2265 2(1\u2212Hr +\u03b5)d holds for all d, then we have\n\nP [conv S \u2286 \u2202 P | S is spanning] = o(1) .\nFigure 1 illustrates the threshold values 1\u2212Hr . The aim of the current section\nis to show that Proposition 1 implies Theorem 1.\n\n\f2.1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet A be the r \u00d7 d matrix whose rows are S1 , . . . , Sr . Clearly, d(S) equals the\nnumber of columns of A which are neither 0 (the all-zero vector) nor 1 (the\nall-one vector).\nThe random matrix A is distributed in the same way as an r \u00d7 d matrix is\ndistributed whose columns are chosen independently uniformly at random from\n{0, 1}r . For t \u2208 {0, 1}r chosen uniformly at random, we have P [t 6\u2208 {0, 1}] =\n1 \u2212 21\u2212r .\nThe de Moivre-Laplace Theorem (see, e.g., [10, Chap. 7]) yields that, for\nevery \u03b4 > 0, there is a B\u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u221a \u0003\n\u0002\nP |d(S) \u2212 (1 \u2212 21\u2212r )d| \u2264 B\u03b4 d \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4\n(4)\nholds for all large enough d.\nFor each \u03b4 > 0, define\n\u221a\n\b\nJ\u03b4 (d) := j \u2208 [d] : |j \u2212 (1 \u2212 21\u2212r )d| \u2264 B\u03b4 d .\nThus, by (4) we have\n\nP [d(S) \u2208 J\u03b4 ] \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nfor all large enough d.\nLet us denote\nn(S) := {i \u2208 [n] : Xi \u2208 F (S)} .\n2.2\n\nThe case n(d) \u2264 2(\u03c4\u0303r \u2212\u03b5)d\n\nFrom elementary polytope theory one derives\nconv S is a face of P \u21d4 conv S is a face of P \u2229 F (S) .\n\n(6)\n\nLet \u03b4 > 0 be fixed and let jmin \u2208 J\u03b4 such that\n\nP [conv S is a face of P | d(S) = jmin ]\n\b\n= min P [conv S is a face of P | d(S) = j] : j \u2208 J\u03b4 (d) .\n\nThen we have\n\nd\u2212\n\njmin\n1 \u2212 21\u2212r\n\nWe therefore obtain\n\u0003\n\u0002\nE n(S) d(S) = jmin =\n\u2264\n\n\u22642\n\n= o(jmin ) .\n\n2jmin \u2212d (n(d) \u2212 r)\n\n2jmin \u2212d+(\u03c4\u0303r \u2212\u03b5)d+o(jmin )\n1\u221221\u2212r +\u03c4\u0303r \u22121\u2212\u03b5\njmin +o(jmin )\n1\u221221\u2212r\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe fraction in the exponent equals 1 \u2212 Hr \u2212 \u03b5\u2032 where \u03b5\u2032 :=\nMarkov's inequality, we obtain\n\n\u03b5\n1\u221221\u2212r\n\n> 0.

(9)\n\nWe omit the calculations that are necessary to prove the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 > 0 with \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 1 + \u03b2\u03b3, \u00f1(d) := \u230a2\u03b1d \u230b, j(d) = \u03b2d +\no(d), and let F be any j(d)-dimensional face of Qd . If X1 , . . . , X\u00f1(d) are chosen\nindependently uniformly at random from Vd , then we have\n\u0003\n\u0002\nP {i \u2208 [\u00f1(d)] : Xi \u2208 F } \u2265 2\u03b3j(d) = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n\nNow we can prove the second part of Theorem 1 (using Proposition 1). Let\n\u03b4 > 0 be fixed and let jmax \u2208 J\u03b4 such that\n\nP [conv S \u2286 \u2202(P \u2229 F (S)) | d(S) = jmax ]\n\b\n= max P [conv S \u2286 \u2202(P \u2229 F (S)) | d(S) = j] : j \u2208 J\u03b4 (d) .\n\nWith \u03b1 := \u03c4\u0303r + \u03b5, \u03b2 := 1 \u2212 21\u2212r , and \u03b3 := 1 \u2212 Hr + \u03b5, one easily verifies\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 > 1 + \u03b2\u03b3. Since jmax = (1 \u2212 21\u2212r )d + o(d) we thus obtain from Lemma 1\n\nP [n(S) \u2265 2(1\u2212Hr +\u03b5)jmax | d(S) = jmax ] = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n\n(10)\n\nThe second part of Proposition 1 implies\n\nP [conv S \u2286 \u2202(P \u2229 F (S)) | d(S) = jmax , n(S) \u2265 2(1\u2212Hr +\u03b5)jmax ] = o(1) .\nFurthermore, since dim(aff S) is constant, we obviously have\n\nP [P \u2229 aff S = P \u2229 F (S) | d(S) = jmax , n(S) \u2265 2(1\u2212Hr +\u03b5)jmax ] = o(1) .\nTogether with (10), the definition of jmax , and (5), the latter two equations even\nhold for the corresponding unconditioned probabilities. Thus, we have\n\nP [conv S \u2286 \u2202(P \u2229 F (S)) or P \u2229 aff S = P \u2229 F (S)] = o(1) ,\nwhich, due to (9), proves the second part of Theorem 1.\n\n\f3\n\nMembership probabilities\n\nHere, we derive (from Dyer, F\u00fcredi, and McDiarmid's paper [5]) suitable lower\nbounds on n(d) that, for specified points of Qd , guarantee their membership in\nour random 0/1-polytopes with high probability.\nFor any z \u2208 Qd , let us define\np(z) :=\n\n\b\n1\nmin |U \u2229 Vd | : U \u2282 Rd (closed affine) halfspace, z \u2208 U\nd\n2\n\n.\n\nFor each \u03b1 > 0, denote\n\n\u2212\u03b1d\nQ\u03b1\n}.\nd := {z \u2208 Qd : p(z) \u2265 2\n\nFor z = (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6d ) \u2208 int Qd (the interior of Qd ), define\nH(z) :=\n\n1 X\nh(\u03b6j ) .\nd\nj\u2208[d]\n\nFrom Lemmas 2.1 and 4.1 of [5] one can deduce the following fact. Let us mention that in particular the proof of Lemma 4.1 (needed for part (2) of Lemma 2)\nis quite hard. It is the core of Dyer, F\u00fcredi, and McDiarmid's beautiful paper.\nLemma 2. Let \u03b1, \u03b5 > 0.\n1. If \u00f1(d) \u2265 2(\u03b1+\u03b5)d holds for all d, and X1 , . . . , X\u00f1(d) \u2208 Vd are chosen independently uniformly at random, then we have\n\nP [Q\u03b1d \u2286 conv {X1 , . . . , X\u00f1(d) }] = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n2. For large enough d,\n{z \u2208 int Qd : H(z) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b5} \u2286 Q\u03b1\nd\nholds.\nThe following straight consequence (choose \u03b1 := 1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b5/2) of Lemma 2 is\nthe key to the proof of the second part of Proposition 1.\nCorollary 1. If \u03b2 > 0, \u00f1(d) \u2265 2(1\u2212\u03b2+\u03b5)d for all d, and X1 , . . . , X\u00f1(d) \u2208 Vd are\nchosen independently uniformly at random, then we have\n\nP {z \u2208 int Qd : H(z) \u2265 \u03b2} \u2286 conv {X1 , . . . , X\u00f1(d) } = 1 \u2212 o(1) .\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nShallow cuts of the cube\n\nThis section is the heart of the proof of (the first part of) Proposition 1.\nFor m \u2208 {1, 2, . . . }, let A(m) be an r \u00d7 M matrix with M := (2r \u2212 2)m that\nhas as its columns m copies of each vector v \u2208 {0, 1}r \\ {0, 1}. This choice is\nmotivated by the following fact (which is, however, irrelevant in this section):\nIf S1 , . . . , Sr are chosen independently uniformly at random from VM , then the\nmultiplicity m of each vector v \u2208 {0, 1}r among the columns of A(m) equals\nthe expected number of appearances of v as a column of the matrix with rows\nS1 , . . . , Sr - conditioned on the event that S is spanning.\nLet s1 , . . . , sr \u2208 {0, 1}M be the rows of A(m), and let, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1, L(i)\n\u0001\nbe the set of indices of columns that have precisely i ones. We have |L(i)| = ri m.\nDenote by \u03c3(i) the number of ones that any of the rows has in columns indexed\n\u0001\nby L(i) (these numbers are equal for all rows). Obviously, we have \u03c3(i) = ri ri m.\nLet b := (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2M ) be the barycenter of the rows s1 , . . . , sr . For each\nj \u2208 [M ] we thus have \u03b2j = i(j)\nr , if j \u2208 L(i(j)). Consequently (with the definition\nof H(*) from Section 3),\nH(b) =\n\n1\nM\n\nX \u0012r \u0013\ni\u0001\nmh\n= Hr .\nr\ni\n\n(11)\n\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\nFrom Section 3 (see Lemma 2) we know that no hyperplane in RM that\ncontains b can therefore cut off significantly less than 2Hr M points from VM ,\nand that there are indeed hyperplanes containing b that do also not cut off\nsignificantly more than 2Hr M cube vertices. However, for our purposes, it will\nbe necessary to know that there is a hyperplane containing not only b, but even\nthe entire set {s1 , . . . , sr }, and nevertheless cutting off not significantly more\nthan 2Hr M cube vertices.\nThe next result guarantees the existence of such a hyperplane, i.e., a certain\nshallow cut of the cube. Its proof will also reveal the basic reason for the appearance of the entropy function h(*): It is due to the well-known fact that, for\nany constant \u03b1 > 0,\nX \u0012q \u0013\n= 2h(\u03b1)q+o(q)\n(12)\np\np\u2208[\u03b1q]\n\n(see, e.g., [11, Chap. 9,Ex. 42]).\nProposition 2.

Throughout the proof, we denote the components of any vectors a, l, z \u2208\nRr\u22121 by \u03b1i , \u03bbi , and \u03b6i , respectively.\nFor every a \u2208 Rr\u22121 and l \u2208 Nr\u22121 , denote by \u03c9a (l) the number of 0/1-solutions\nto (13) with precisely \u03bbi ones in components indexed by L(i) and define\n\u0001\nY \u0012 r m\u0013\ni\n.\n\u03c9(l) :=\n\u03bbi\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\nWith\nLa :=\nwe thus have\n\n\b\n\nl \u2208 Nr\u22121 :\n\nX\n\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\n(\n\n\u03c9a (l) =\n\n\u03b1i \u03bbi \u2264\n\nX\n\n\u03b1i \u03c3(i)\n\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\n\u03c9(l) if l \u2208 La\n.\n0\notherwise\n\nConsequently, the number of 0/1-points satisfying (13) is precisely\nX\n\u03c9(l) .\n\n(14)\n\nl\u2208La\n\n\u0001\nIf, for some i, we have \u03bbi > ri m, then clearly \u03c9(l) = 0. Thus, the number of\nnonzero summands in (14) is O(mr ). Below, we will exhibit a vector a \u2208 Rr\u22121\nof (constant) coefficients that satisfies, with z \u22c6 := (\u03c3(1), . . . , \u03c3(r \u2212 1)),\n\u03c9(l) \u2264 \u03c9(z \u22c6 ) 2o(M)\n\n(15)\n\nfor all l \u2208 La .

Note that z \u22c6 itself is contained in the\ninterior int B of the box B, where \u03b7 is a differentiable function.\nIn fact, since ln(*) is monotonically increasing, we may equivalently investigate the function \u03b7\u0303 : int B \u2192 R defined via\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u03b6i ln \u03b6i + (Mi \u2212 \u03b6i ) ln(Mi \u2212 \u03b6i ) ,\nMi ln Mi \u2212\n\u03b7\u0303(z) := ln \u03b7(z) =\n\u22c6\n\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\ni\u2208[r\u22121]\n\nand thus find a vector a \u2208 Rr\u22121 of coefficients with\n\u03b7\u0303(z \u22c6 ) \u2265 \u03b7\u0303(z)\n\nfor all z \u2208 Ua \u2229 int B .\n\n(16)\n\nMi \u2212 \u03c3(i) \u2212 tvi\n.\n\u03c3(i) + tvi\n\n(17)\n\nNow we choose the vector a \u2208 Rr\u22121 to be the gradient of \u03b7\u0303 at z \u22c6 .

Define v := z \u2212z \u22c6 , and consider the function \u03b7\u0303z\u22c6 ,z : [0, 1] \u2192 R\ndefined via \u03b7\u0303z\u22c6 ,z (t) := \u03b7\u0303(z \u22c6 + tv).

If vi < 0, then \u033a(t) > \u033a(0), and\nthus, vi ln \u033a(t) < vi ln \u033a(0) = \u03b1i vi . Hence, in any case the i-th summand in (17)\nis at most as large as \u03b1i vi .
