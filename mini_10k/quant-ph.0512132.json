Both questions\nhave a scope which goes well beyond Physics, and in particular Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.\n\n1. Preliminary Remarks\nBringing Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity together is nowadays considered to be a problem of Physics, and in fact, its fundamental one. Yet not seldom when solving more fundamental problems in\nany given realm, it may well happen that the sought after solution is\nless accessible when the ways of thinking are constrained or limited to\nthe respective realm, in this case, the usual ones in Physics.\nLet us recall in this regard the celebrated 1960 paper of the Nobel\nlaureate Eugene Wigner, entitled \"The unreasonable effectiveness of\nmathematics in the natural sciences\", see [2]. There have been various\ncomments upon, and interpretations of that quite manifest and most\nimpressive \"unreasonable effectiveness\". And the issue, most likely, is\nnot that Mathematics happens to be more fundamental than Physics,\nfor instance. Rather, it could be about the fact that both Mathemat1\n\n\fics and Physics, as they stand today, come from a yet deeper mode\nof human insight, a mode which, so far, has not been formalized as a\nscience.\nIn view of such a possibility, it may indeed be useful to try to avoid the\nexclusiveness of constraining the ways of thinking to the customary\nones in Physics, when trying to bring about the unification of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.\nThe ways of thinking in both Mathematics and Physics have their\nspecific qualities and strengths. In Mathematics one is supposed to be\nperfectly precise, and also most abstract, at least when compared with\nother natural sciences. Also, creativity in bringing up new ideas and\nresults is rigorously controlled by the requirements of logic, as well as\nof proofs of conjectures. On the other hand, Physics is significantly\nmore free and protean when it comes to new ideas and hypotheses. Of\ncourse, there is again a control, and in fact, a double one this time,\nnamely, of a certain theoretical consistency and of possible supporting\nexperiments, or at least, the lack of contrary ones. The theoretical\nconsistency, however, is not of that extreme rigor as in Mathematics,\nsince much of the more fundamental Physics, among others Quantum\nMechanics or Quantum Field Theory, has a somewhat tentative or\nheuristic mathematical formulation.\nThis specific quite free and protean nature of thinking in Physics,\nrather distinct from that in Mathematics among others, brings with\nit a certain entrapping temptation. Namely, it creates the strong and\noften irresistible impression, if not in fact of certainly, not only of a\ngenerously rich self-contained realm of thinking, but implicitly also of\nthe inappropriateness of any other way of thinking when dealing with\nproblems in Physics.\nSo much, therefore, for the chance to realize that more fundamental\nproblems in Physics may seriously benefit from ways of thinking which\nare not constrained or limited to the usual ones in Physics.\nAnd now, let us turn to some of the specifics of the problem of bringing Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity together.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this regard, it may be instructive to start by recalling the way Special Relativity seems to have emerged in Einstein's thinking. It is often\nreported that, around the age of 16 or 17, Einstein started to wonder\nabout the following thought-experiment. Assume that a beam of light\nis emitted from some source S and in the direction A. Einstein then\nimagined that he himself would move next to that beam of light and\ndo so with the velocity of light. The question which kept puzzled him\nwas : what would he observe ? His answer was that he would only\nobserve some stationary states. For instance, he would keep seeing\nthe source S of light in ever the same state in which it was when it\nemitted that beam. Further, he would see the light beam next to him\nas a standing wave in space. And obviously, both of these observations where wrong. After all, the source may change its state with the\npassing of time, not to mention that standing light waves were not\ncompatible with the Maxwell equations.\nThe conclusion Einstein drew in 1905 from the above was that the\nvelocity of light could not depend on that of the observer.\nThis conclusion then became one of the two basic principles of Special\nRelativity. The other basic principle was the old Galilean one, according to which it is not possible to detect absolute rest or absolute\nmotion.\nWhat happened during the next ten years, while Einstein tried to include gravitation in relativity, may be particularly instructive today,\nwe one attempts to bring together Quantum Mechanics and General\nRelativity.\nThe various respective attempts Einstein made over a decade were\nmotivated not so much by what would later be called \"general covariance\", as rather by a number of specific physical arguments. On the\nother hand, focusing more on \"general covariance\" may have helped\nin simplifying the issues and reaching in a more direct manner the\nEinstein field equations. After all, there are only two entities invariant under \"general covariance\", namely, volume and curvature. And\nthe true essence of General Relativity is very much contained in the\n\"general covariance\" of the Einstein field equations.\nA similar situation was to happen half a century later in Quantum Mechanics with respect to the Bell Inequalities. As it turns out, Bell type\n3\n\n\finequalities were known to George Boole in the 1850s, see [1]. Consequently, the Bell Inequalities can be established without any physical\narguments. It follows that the original contribution in the Bell inequalities is not in the inequalities themselves, but in showing the fact\nthat they contradict Quantum Mechanics. On the other hand, the\nclarity of this most simple and fundamental fact is completely lost in\nthe way the Bell inequalities are rather without exception presented\nand commented upon in a considerable amount of texts written by\nphysicists. Indeed, in all such texts, which limit themselves exclusively to the exhibition of any number of arguments in Physics, the\nresulting complex buildup of arguments can only serve to obscure the\nunderlying clarity and simplicity of the mentioned fundamental fact.\n\n2. What Is the Local Point of View ?\nThere appear to be two alternatives when formulating theories of\nPhysics, namely\n\u2022 (A 1) There can only be a non-local, more precisely, global formulation, which therefore must be unique, or\n\u2022 (A 2) A variety of local observers can have valid formulations\nregarding the same physical wholeness which is the object of the\ntheory, just as it is the object in the case of the first alternative\n(A 1).\nSo far, throughout the history of Physics, the second alternative (A 2)\nhas been embraced. Moreover, there has been a significant unease, if\nnot even ill-feeling, with respect to physical phenomena which cannot\nbe localized in some suitable manner.\nLet us therefore start from the point of view of the second alternative\n(A 2).\nIn this case, each local formulation of the physical wholeness is expected to be equivalent in some appropriate way with all the other\nones. In other words, we expect a certain principle of \"relativity\" to\nhold among the set of such local formulations.\nFor instance, in Special and General Relativity this is precisely the\n4\n\n\fcase. Furthermore, in these two theories the local aspect corresponds\nto a given frame of reference, while the equivalence is expressed by the\nLorentz, respectively, general covariance.\nTurning now to the bringing together of Quantum Mechanics and\nGeneral Relativity, and doing so along the lines of the second above\nalternative (A 2), that is, by building local theories, the first question\nwhich appears to arise is as follows\n\u2022 (Q 1) : What is the appropriate local point of view ?\nClearly, the scope of this question is more general than referring only\nto Quantum Mechanics or General Relativity. In fact, the scope of\nthis question may easily go beyond the whole of Physics as such. Yet\nits importance, and in fact, priority is quite obvious, in case we start\nfrom the point of view of the second alternative (A 2).\nNow, coming again back to our problem of bringing Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity together, it is not immediate that the local\nframes of reference, so essential in both Special and General Relativity, may be sufficient in this case. Also, the non-relativistic classical,\nor special relativistic frames of reference presently used in Quantum\nMechanics may equally be insufficient.\nAnd then, before unleashing the usual protean variety of exclusively\nphysical arguments, it may perhaps be more appropriate to focus on\nthis seemingly more general and deep issue, namely, to try to understand what may an appropriate local point of view be, as asked in (Q\n1).\nHere, in this regard, it may be useful to recall the following.\nIn General Relativity there exists a \"state space\" given by a specific\nfour dimensional Einstein manifold. In non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics of finite systems there exists a \"configuration space\" given by\na suitable Euclidean space, while the \"state space\" is supposed to be\nthe Hilbert space of square integrable functions defined on the Euclidean space.\nThis difference alone, not to mention that related to the way the spaces\n5\n\n\fof \"observables\" are defined in each of these two theories, may already\nbe reason enough to consider the above question (Q 1).\nWhat has instead happened so far is the following. An exclusive focus\nwas placed on coming up with suitable new \"state\" or \"configuration\"\nspaces. String and Super-string Theory, for instance, postulate as\nground physical entities certain continuous geometric structures which\ntake place of the zero dimensional points of classical \"state spaces\".\nAlternative approaches, such as in Quantum Gravity, may postulate\nas an ultimate underlying physical ground various discrete, or locally\ndiscrete structures.\nThus none of these approaches sees as a priority answering the above\nquestion (Q 1). Consequently, none of these approaches can express\nin a suitable manner \"general covariance\", which is the hallmark of\nthe second, that is, local alternative mentioned above in (A 2).\nIt appears, therefore, that the priority is indeed with answering the\nabove question (Q 1), or in its reformulated manner\n\u2022 (Q 1\u2217 ) What is the appropriate concept of \"frame of\nreference\" ?\n\n3. Which General Covariance ?\nOnce question (Q 1), or equivalently, (Q 1\u2217 ) was answered, one is led\nto the second question\n\u2022 (Q 2) What are the requirements of \"general covariance\" ?\nIn this regard, it may be quite likely that an answer to question (Q\n1) does not necessarily determine, but only limits or conditions the\nanswer to question (Q 2).\n\n4. Conclusions\nNeedless to say, lots of physical arguments may be involved in answering the above questions (Q 1) and (Q 2).\nHowever, two facts should not be overlooked, namely\n6\n\n\f\u2022 Both questions (Q 1) and (Q 2) have a scope which goes well beyond Physics, and in particular Quantum Mechanics or General\nRelativity,\n\u2022 Both questions (Q 1) and (Q 2), in that order, seem to have the\nhighest priority when trying to bring together Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.\nWithin alternative (A 2) - which is both the traditional and present\nday view of Physics - until the emergence of Special and General Relativity it appeared most natural to start first with a view of the physical wholeness which is the object of any given theory in Physics. This\nwholeness was then modelled, among others, by one or another \"state\nspace\". Yet ironically, no such \"state space\" could be defined mathematically, unless some frame of reference was tacitly assumed and\nemployed. Typical in this regard is the absolute space and time of\nNewtonian Mechanics. In this way, the priority of \"frames of reference\" was in fact already there, even if implicitly.\nStarting with Special Relativity, \"frames of reference\" obtained an explicit priority in any mathematical model.\nA second departure happened with Quantum Mechanics, where in\naddition to the traditional \"state space\" given by a suitable Hilbert\nspace, one would now have the \"observables\" given by self-adjoint\noperators on that Hilbert space. And strangely enough, the \"state\nspace\" would now no longer be assumed directly accessible, but only\nthrough the \"observables\".\nSuch a state of affairs may further support the above point of view\nregarding the priority in asking questions (Q 1) and (Q 2).\n\nReferences\n[1] Rosinger E E : George Boole and the Bell inequalities. arXiv:\nquant-ph/0406004\n[2] Wigner E : The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences.
