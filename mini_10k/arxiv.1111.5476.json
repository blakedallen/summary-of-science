[1\u20134]) or functional renormalization group (FRG) flow equations (for reviews see Refs. [5,\n6]), or in Coulomb gauge, using DSEs [7]. In addition, variational [8\u201315] or FRG methods [16] were used in the\nHamiltonian formulation of Yang\u2013Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. All those various approaches have in common that\nthe infrared (IR) sector of the theory is dominated by the ghost degrees of freedom, which has been referred to as\n\"ghost dominance\". For this reason the ghost-gluon vertex is of crucial importance in these approaches. Inspired by\nTaylor's work [17] showing the non-renormalization of the ghost-gluon vertex in Landau gauge, in all the approaches\nmentioned above it was tacitly assumed that the ghost-gluon vertex is bare. In Ref. [18] a semi-perturbative calculation\nof the ghost-gluon vertex was carried out and it was found that its dressing is small even in the IR, a result which\nis also found on the lattice [19, 20]. Although Taylor's proof of non-renormalization formally applies also to the\nghost-gluon vertex in the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang\u2013Mils theory in Coulomb gauge, the results for the dressing\nof the ghost-gluon vertex obtained in the functional integral formulation of Yang\u2013Mills theory in Landau gauge [18]\ncannot be assumed to remain valid also in the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge. Furthermore, recently it\nwas found within the FRG-approach in Landau gauge that the dressing of the ghost-gluon vertex becomes crucial at\nhigh temperatures [21]. Since the high-temperature limit of the 4-dimensional Yang\u2013Mills theory is essentially the\n3-dimensional Euclidean Yang\u2013Mills theory and the latter provides an approximation to the Yang\u2013Mills vacuum wave\nfunctional in 3 + 1 dimensions1 [22], the dressing of the ghost-gluon vertex of the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb\ngauge should be expected to be also substantial. Therefore, in the present paper we investigate the ghost-gluon vertex\nof the Hamiltonian approach to Yang\u2013Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. We will solve the DSE for the ghost-gluon vertex\nusing as input the non-perturbative ghost and gluon propagators previously obtained in the variational approach.\nIn Sec. II we briefly summarize the basic ingredients of the Hamiltonian approach to Yang\u2013Mills theory in Coulomb\ngauge and also present the results obtained for the ghost and gluon propagators. In Sec. III we give a short derivation\nof the DSE for the ghost-gluon vertex, and introduce the truncation scheme. Our numerical results are presented in\nSec. IV. Some concluding remarks are given in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nEQUAL-TIME PROPAGATORS IN COULOMB GAUGE\n\nThe Hamiltonian approach to Yang\u2013Mills theory in Coulomb gauge is based on canonical quantization in Weyl gauge\nAa0 = 0, and results in a Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which has to be solved for the vacuum wave functional \u03c8[A] = hA|0i\nof the transverse gauge field \u2202i Aai = 0. Once \u03c8[A] is known all static (time-independent) Green's functions can be\nevaluated. In Refs. [10, 13] the Yang\u2013Mills Schr\u00f6dinger equation was solved in an approximate fashion using the\nvariational principle and assuming Gaussian-type trial wave functionals.\n\n1\n\nMore precisely, the functional integral of 3-dimensional Euclidean Yang\u2013Mills theory in Landau gauge can be interpreted as the functional\nintegral of the vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge in 3 + 1 dimensions with a vacuum wave\nfunctional given by \u03c8[A] \u223c exp(\u2212 12 Sym [A]), where Sym [A] is the classical action of 3-dimensional Euclidean Yang\u2013Mills theory. This\nwave functional was shown to provide a decent approximation to the true Yang\u2013Mills vacuum wave functional in the mid-momentum\nregime [23].\n\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\n\f2\nIn the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang\u2013Mills theory, Coulomb gauge can be implemented in the expectation value\nof any functional K[A] of the (spatial components of the) gauge field A by the Faddeev\u2013Popov method, which results\nin\nZ\nDA JA |\u03c8[A]|2 K[A] .\n(1)\nhK[A]i =\n\u03a9\n\nHere, JA = Det(G\u22121\nA ) is the Faddeev\u2013Popov determinant with\n\n\u0001\nab\nG\u22121\n(x, y) = \u2212\u03b4 ab \u2202 2 \u2212 gf acb Aci (x)\u2202i \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\nA\n\n(2)\n\nbeing the Faddeev\u2013Popov operator. Furthermore, g is the coupling constant and f acb are the structure constants of\nthe su(Nc ) algebra. The functional integration in Eq. (1) extends over transverse field configurations restricted to the\nfirst Gribov region \u03a9 or, more precisely, to the fundamental modular region [24]. Moreover, we assume that the wave\nfunctional \u03c8[A] is properly normalized, such that h1i = 1.\nTo simplify the bookkeeping we will use the compact notation Aai11 (x1 ) \u2261 A(1) and assume that a repeated label\nmeans summation over colour and spatial indices along with integration over the spatial coordinates,\nZ\nA * B = A(1)B(1) = d3 x Aai (x)Bia (x).\n(3)\nWe use the same convention for indices referring to the ghost field except that the label \"1\" represents only the colour\nindex a1 and the spatial coordinate x1 .\nThe gluon propagator D and the ghost propagator G are defined by the expectation values\nD(1, 2) = hA(1)A(2)i ,\n\nG(1, 2) = hGA (1, 2)i .\n\n(4)\n\nIn momentum space we express the gluon propagator by the gluon energy \u03a9(p)\nAai (p)Abj (q) =: \u03b4 ab (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(p + q)\n\ntij (p)\n,\n2\u03a9(p)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere tij (p) = \u03b4ij \u2212 pi pj /p2 is the transverse projector in momentum space. Furthermore the ghost propagator can\nbe represented as\nGab (p) = \u03b4 ab\n\nd(p)\n,\ngp2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere d(p) is the ghost form factor. Assuming the so-called horizon condition d\u22121 (0) = 0, the results obtained with\nGaussian-type wave functionals [13] show an IR diverging gluon energy \u03a9(p) which can be fitted with Gribov's formula\n[25]\ns\nm4\n\u03a9(p2 ) = p2 + 2A ,\n(7)\np\nwith a mass parameter m2A \u2243 0.6 \u03c3c (for Nc = 2), where \u03c3c is the Coulomb string tension, i.e. the coefficient of the\nlinear term of the non-Abelian Coulomb potential. These results compare favourably with recent lattice calculations\n[26]; in particular, the infrared regime of the gluon energy is correctly reproduced.\n\nIII.\n\nDERIVATION OF THE GHOST-GLUON VERTEX DSE\n\nIn the functional integral formulation of Yang\u2013Mills theory in Landau gauge the DSE for the ghost-gluon vertex\nhas been known for quite some time, see e.g. Ref. [27]. In the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge the DSE for\nthe ghost-gluon vertex was derived in Ref. [15]. We briefly summarize this derivation in order to fix our notation.\nThe Faddeev\u2013Popov operator Eq. (2) can be inverted to give the following operator identity for the ghost operator\nGA\ne 0 (5; 4, 6) G0 (6, 2).\nGA (1, 2) = G0 (1, 2) \u2212 GA (1, 4)A(5) \u0393\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 1.

(8) and using Eq. (10) one obtains the DSE for the ghost propagator G, which reads\n\nIf Eq. (8) is multiplied by a gauge field A(3) before taking the expectation value, we are led to\n\nwhere we have used hAi = 0. For the left-hand side of Eq. (12) the relation (10) can be used, while the expectation\nvalue on the right-hand side can be expanded in terms of vertex functions and propagators [15]. By using the DSE\n(11) for the ghost propagator, the DSE (12) for the ghost-gluon vertex becomes\ne 2, 3) = \u0393\ne 0 (1; 2, 3) + \u0393(1;\ne 4, 5)G(4\u2032 , 4)G(5, 5\u2032 )\u0393(6\ne \u2032 ; 5\u2032 , 3)D(6, 6\u2032 )\u0393\ne 0 (6; 2, 4\u2032 )\n\u0393(1;\ne \u2032 ; 2, 6)G(6, 6\u2032 )\u0393\ne 0 (5\u2032 ; 6\u2032 , 3)\n+ \u0393(1, 4, 5)D(4, 4\u2032 )D(5, 5\u2032 )\u0393(4\n\n(13)\n\ne 5; 2, 4)D(5, 5 )G(4, 4 )\u0393\ne 0 (5 ; 4 , 3),\n\u2212 \u0393(1,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne 5; 2, 4) is the ghost-gluon scattering kernel. Equation (13) is\nwhere \u0393(1, 4, 5) is the three-gluon vertex, and \u0393(1,\nrepresented diagrammatically in Fig. 1. Note that the vacuum wave functional does not explicitly enter this equation,\nbut only implicitly via the various propagators, in particular the gluon propagator.\nEquation (13) must be truncated to be feasible; in a first step we will discard the proper four-point function. Even\nthen, a fully self-consistent solution of the resulting equation together with the DSEs for the propagators is still very\nexpensive and beyond the scope of this work. To get a first estimate of the size of the dressing of the ghost-gluon\nvertex we will keep the full, non-perturbative propagators but approximate the vertices in the loop terms by their\nbare form. If the usual assumption of a bare ghost-gluon vertex is justified, the corrections to the bare vertex from\nthe one-loop terms should turn out to be small.\nThe bare three-gluon vertex is given by the three-gluon kernel \u03b33 in the exponent of the vacuum wave functional\n[15]\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\n\u03c8[A] = exp \u2212 \u03c9A2 \u2212\n\u03b33 A3 \u2212 . . .\n(14)\n2\n3!2\nwhich is found from the variational calculation to be given by [15]\nabc\n\u03b3ijk\n(p, q, k) =\n\n2f abc Tijk (p, q, k)\n,\n\u03a9(p) + \u03a9(q) + \u03a9(k)\n\nwhere T is the Lorentz structure of the three-gluon coupling in the Hamiltonian\n\u0003\n\u0002\nTijk (p, q, k) = ig \u03b4ij (p \u2212 q)k + \u03b4jk (q \u2212 k)i + \u03b4ki (k \u2212 p)j .\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nNote that \u03b33 Eq. (15) is the bare part of the three-gluon vertex \u03933 in the sense that it is the leading term in the DSE\nfor \u03933 . However, \u03b33 Eq. (15) is not the lowest-order perturbative vertex, which is obtained from Eq. (15) when the\ngluon energy \u03a9(p) is replaced by its perturbative counterpart |p|.\n\n\f4\nAfter implementing the truncations explained above and extracting the colour structure, Eq.

In Eq. (17) k, p, and q are respectively the momenta of the\ngluon and the incoming and outgoing ghost, and momentum conservation k + p + q = 0 is implicitly understood.\nWe parameterize the full ghost-gluon vertex by a dressing function h as\n\u0002\n\u0003\ne i (k; p, q) = ig tij (k)pj 1 + h(k 2 ; p2 , q 2 ) .\n(18)\n\u0393\n\nLet us stress that in the present Hamiltonian approach the Coulomb gauge condition is exactly implemented, and\nthe functional integral of the scalar product of the Hilbert space is strictly restricted to (spatially) transverse gauge\nfields. Therefore, in the present case the ghost-gluon vertex cannot develop a longitudinal part.\nContracting Eqs. (17) and (18) with pi and dividing both sides by pi pj tij (k) we obtain2\nh(k 2 ; p2 , q 2 ) = I1 (k 2 ; p2 , q 2 ) + gI2 (k 2 ; p2 , q 2 ),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\nI1 =\n\nNc\n4p2 [1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2 ]\n\nZ\n\nd\u0304 l pi tij (k)lj\n\nd(l) d(l + k) pm (p + k)n tmn (l \u2212 p)\n\u03a9(l \u2212 p)\nl2 (l + k)2\n\nis the contribution of the diagram with three ghost-gluon vertices, and\nZ\npi pj (p + k)k til (k)tjm (l)tkn (l + k)Tlmn (k, l, \u2212l \u2212 k) d(l \u2212 p)\nNc\nd\u0304 l\nI2 =\n\u03a9(l)\u03a9(l + k)[\u03a9(k) + \u03a9(l) + \u03a9(l + k)]\n(l \u2212 p)2\n4p2 [1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2 ]\n\n(20a)\n\n(20b)\n\nis the contribution of the diagram containing the three-gluon vertex; the latter is multiplied by the coupling constant\ng due to the parameterization of the ghost propagator, see Eq.

In the subsequent numerical calculations we will consider\ntwo classes of kinematic configurations, namely\nh(p2 ; p2 , xp2 )\n\nand\n\nh(xp2 ; p2 , p2 ),\n\n(21)\n\nwhere x is restricted to the interval x \u2208 [0, 4] due to momentum conservation.\nBefore concluding this section we investigate the IR limit of the ghost-gluon vertex. In the IR the ghost and gluon\npropagator can be parameterized as\nd(p \u2192 0) \u223c\n\nm\u03b2c\n,\n|p|\u03b2\n\n\u03a9(p \u2192 0) \u223c\n\nm1+\u03b1\nA\n,\n|p|\u03b1\n\n(22)\n\nwith \u03b2 > 0 to fulfil the horizon condition d\u22121 (0) = 0. These IR exponents obey the sum rule 1 + \u03b1 = 2\u03b2 [12, 28, 29].\nInserting the IR ansatzes Eq. (22) into Eqs. (20) we find that in the limit of vanishing momenta the form factor of\nthe ghost gluon vertex approaches the finite expression\nNc\nh(0; 0, 0) =\n24(1 + \u03b2)\u03c0 2\n\n\u0012\n\nmc\nmA\n\n\u00132\u03b2\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\nA fit to the numerical data [13] for the propagators with Nc = 2 and the solution \u03b2 = 1 yields mc \u2243 4.97 \u03c3c while\nmA was given below Eq.

Numerical results for the two integrals contributing to the form factor of the ghost-gluon vertex h(p2 ; p2 , xp2 ), see\nEqs. (19) and (20).\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nFor the ghost and gluon propagators we use the results obtained previously in the variational approach [13] as\ninput. In particular, for the gluon propagator we use the Gribov formula [Eq. (7)], while for the ghost form factor\n[Eq. (6)] we use the parameterization [15, 30]\n\nd(p) = a\n\ns\n\n1\np2 /\u03c3c\n\n+\n\n1\nln(p2 /\u03c3c\n\n+ c)\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwith a = 4.97 and c = 16. The factor g has been absorbed in the ghost propagator as explained in Refs. [10, 13]. This\nhas the advantage that the coupling constant g disappears from the coupled system of equations, as long as gluonic\nvertices are ignored. However, since the diagram containing the three-gluon vertex has a prefactor g 2 but only a\nsingle ghost propagator in the integral,\nin Eq. (19) there remains an explicit factor g. We will take the coupling at\n\u221a\nthe renormalization point \u03bc = 2.4 \u03c3c [13] gr = 3.5.\nFigure 2 shows the values of the two integrals I1 and I2 separately, for equal ghost and gluon momentum. The\nintegral I1 involving three ghost-gluon vertices approaches the IR value evaluated in Eq. (23), showing a modest\ndependence on the kinematic configuration. At high momenta it drops off logarithmically, due to the anomalous\ndimension of the ghost propagator. The integral I2 involving the three-gluon vertex vanishes in the deep IR, due to\nthe IR divergence of the gluon energy\n\u221a \u03a9(k) in the denominator, see Eqs. (17) and (20), and drops off in the UV more\nslowly than the ghost-loop term (1/ ln p instead of 1/ ln p), since it contains only one ghost propagator. Figure (3)\nshows the total form factor h(p2 ; p2 , xp2 ).\nMore interesting is the kinematic configuration where the ghost legs have momenta of equal magnitude and the\ngluon momentum is varied, see Fig. 4. One observes that the maximum in the mid-momentum regime gets stronger as\nthe gluon momentum approaches zero. If the gluon momentum is very small but not zero (dashed line with x = 10\u22124\nin Fig. 4), the form factor is almost indistinguishable from the case of vanishing gluon momentum in the IR and in\nthe mid-momentum regime; however, at higher momenta the term involving the three-gluon vertex dominates, and\nwe observe again the (ln p)\u22121/2 behaviour.\nAs explained in the footnote of the introduction, the 3-dimensional Euclidean Yang\u2013Mills theory in Landau gauge is\nequivalent to the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge in 3+1 dimensions using a specific vacuum wave functional,\nwhich is a decent approximation to the true one in the mid-momentum regime. Therefore we can compare our results\nwith lattice data from 3-dimensional Landau gauge [20], see Fig. 5. The vertex there displays a maximum in the\nmid-momentum regime which is somewhat stronger than in our work; furthermore, the form factor from the lattice\nseems to approach zero or even a small negative value in the IR. Qualitatively similar results have been obtained in\n3- and 4-dimensional Landau gauge both in the continuum [18] and on the lattice [19].\n\n\f6\n0.25\n\nx = 1/4\nx = 1/2\nx=1\nx=2\nx=3\n\nh(p2; p2, xp2)\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\u221a\np/ \u03c3c\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFIG. 3.

Explanation see text.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the ghost-gluon vertex of the Hamiltonian approach to Yang\u2013Mills theory in Coulomb gauge.\nThe DSE for the ghost-gluon vertex was solved in one-loop truncation using the non-perturbative ghost and gluon\npropagators obtained previously in the variational approach assuming a bare ghost-gluon vertex. The dressing of the\nghost-gluon vertex was found to increase the vertex between 15% and 25% in the IR and to vanish asymptotically in\nthe UV. Since the gluon propagator obtained in the variational approach with a bare ghost-gluon vertex is qualitatively\nsimilar to that obtained on the lattice [26] (which contains the full dressing of vertices) we expect that a fully selfconsistent solution of the coupled DSEs for the propagators and vertices yield similar results for the ghost-gluon vertex\nas obtained in the present paper. Finally it will be interesting to extend the present studies to finite temperatures [31]\nto see whether there is a similar change of the dressing of the ghost-gluon vertex at high temperatures as observed in\nthe FRG approach in Landau gauge [21].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to P.
