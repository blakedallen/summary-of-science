Efimov was inspired by the physics of the nucleus of the\ntritium atom. However, the experimental signature for the existence of such Efimov states was not\nobserved in nuclear physics, but in a gas of ultracold cesium atoms [2] by studying three-body recombination. The reason that properties predicted for nuclear physics few-body systems can be derived\nfrom ultracold atoms lies in the fact that the two systems are connected through universal relations,\nthat are irrespective of the specific nature of the interparticle interactions.\nSince the first observations in cesium, the Efimov effect has received a lot of attention [3; 4]. Several\ngroups now have observed Efimov physics by studying three-body recombination in a variety of atomic\nsystems [5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14]. Evidence for the existence of trimers appears as some distinct\nfeatures (resonances) in the recombination rate coefficient. In Fig. 1 the energies of the Efimov trimers\nare shown, as a function of the inverse two-body scattering length 1/a.\nA crucial advantage of ultracold atoms with respect to nuclear systems is that the interparticle\ninteractions can be easily manipulated using Feshbach resonances [15; 16], by varying the magnetic\nfield. The two-body scattering length, which is obtained from the scattering phase shift \u03b4(k) as a =\n\u2212 limk\u21920 tan \u03b4(k)/k, diverges on resonance to infinity, and is typically described by the dispersive\nformula\nSpecial issue devoted to Efimov physics\nEindhoven University of Technology, P.O.

The horizontal line K = 0 indicates\nthe threshold to the three-body scattering continuum (gray). Simultaneously, the blue region marks the atomdimer continuum for a > 0, and the green zone indicates the trimer region. The dimer binding energy scales\nas \u22121/a. Only a few Efimov states are shown. The figure is not to scale: for clarity reasons we plotted instead\nof K the quantity H 1/4 sin \u03be, and instead of 1/a the quantity H 1/4 cos \u03be (cf. Eq. (3)).\n\n\u0012\na = abg 1 \u2212\n\n\u2206B\nB \u2212 B0\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith abg the background value of the scattering length, B the magnetic field, B0 the resonance position,\nand \u2206B the width of the resonance. This possibility to change the scattering length allowed for the\nobservation of distinct Efimov features in the three-body recombination rate, connected to two different\nEfimov states in a row [6; 8], confirming the scaling law [1; 17] given by\nETn+1 /ETn = e\u22122\u03c0/s0 \u2248 1/515,\n\n(2)\n\nwith s0 = 1.00624 a constant. Moreover, recent developments extended the universal few-body physics\nto the domain of four-body states which was theoretically predicted [18] and experimentally verified [8;\n19].\nIn most of the experiments, Efimov physics has been observed only indirectly via three-body recombination [17]. Due to the short lifetime of these states, it is difficult to probe the Efimov states\ndirectly. These weakly-bound trimers are not only unstable in collisions with other particles, but they\nare also intrinsically unstable by itself, as trimers may decay to a deeper lying dimer state and an\nunbound atom. However, the group of Jochim in Heidelberg recently succeeded in associating Efimov\ntrimers directly via a new and promising approach using radio-frequency fields [20].\nOptical lattices might provide more experimental control, and potentially give rise to an enhanced\nlifetime of Efimov trimers. Efimov physics can be studied in this way by loading three atoms in each\nlattice site. When the lattice is deep enough, single sites act as harmonic oscillator potentials where\nindividual trimers can be trapped. A possible advantage is then that the interparticle separation of\nthe trimers can be increased to the scale of the harmonic oscillator length, while their properties are\nstill determined by Efimov physics. In this way the overlap of these states with deeply bound dimers is\nreduced, thereby suppressing the process of three-body recombination. The influence of other limiting\nprocesses, where four or more particles involved, will be reduced as well.\nJonsell, Heiselberg and Pethick were the first to introduce an harmonic oscillator term in a threebody system [21], by adapting the approach of Ref. [22]. For diverging scattering length, they found\nexact expressions for the bound states of three identical bosons, while they obtained numerical results\nfor finite scattering length. Later, Werner and Castin [23] obtained additional analytical results for\ndiverging scattering length, and complimentary first-order corrections for large scattering length. Stoll\n\n\f3\n\nand K\u00f6hler [24] performed numerical simulations with a tunable separable potential to find the bound\nstates of three particles in a trap. Th\u00f8gersen et al. found numerical solutions of three particles in a\nharmonic trap [25], mainly to study the non-universal corrections to the Efimov effect that come from\nthe effective range. More recently, Liu, Hu and Drummond derived an analytical description of three\nattractively interacting fermions in a harmonic trap [26].\nA convenient description of the Efimov effect in free space is presented in Ref. [17], in which polar\ncoordinates H and \u03be are introduced, which are related to the wave number or energy parameter K\nand the scattering length a via\nK = H sin \u03be,\n1\n= H cos \u03be.\na\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nUsing Efimov's radial law, it is derived that\nH = \u03ba\u2217 e\u2206(\u03be)/2s0 e\u2212n\u03c0/s0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nfor a function \u2206 : [\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/4] \u2192 R. Here \u03ba\u2217 is the three-body parameter that defines the trimer\nenergies exactly on resonance as ETn = \u2212e\u22122n\u03c0/s0 ~2 \u03ba2\u2217 /m, with m the mass of a single atom, and is\na result of the short-range behavior of three particles being close together. The combinations of K\nand \u03be that yield bound states describe a family of curves that can be mapped on top of each other by\nmultiplying the distance of the curves to the origin by a factor e\u03c0/s0 , see Fig. 1.\nIn this paper, we extend the description of Ref. [17] and show how by introducing the harmonic\noscillator length as a new parameter, and by using spherical coordinates in parameter space, the scaling\nbehavior in free space very naturally generalizes to a situation with three particles in a harmonic trap.\nIn particular, the curves that are shown in Fig. 1 will be replaced by surfaces that are mapped on top\nof each other. In the derivation, we use an approach slightly different from earlier work, that calculates\nthe equivalent of the function \u2206 by solving an ordinary differential equation. Additionally, we also\ninclude the coupling terms, we investigate the stability of the trimers in the lattice, and we study the\nnon-universal corrections coming from the effective range parameter.\n2 Framework\nWe consider a system of three bosons with pair interactions trapped in a harmonic potential. The\ncorresponding Hamiltonian is\nH=\u2212\n\n1 X 2 X\n1X\nri +\nVi ,\n\u2206i +\n2\n2 a4ho\ni\n\ni\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\np\nwhere aho = ~/m\u03c9 is the harmonic oscillator length, \u03c9 the trap frequency, and Vi is the interaction\nbetween the particles j, k, with (i, j, k) a cyclic permutation of (1, 2, 3). For convenience, the Hamiltonian is scaled by a factor m/~2 . Throughout this paper, we will denote the eigenvalues of H by E, and\nthe corresponding trimer energies by ET = ~2 E/m. To find the bound state energies, we closely follow\nthe method described in Ref. [22] and Ref. [17]. We denote the permutation operator corresponding to\none cyclic permutation of (1, 2, 3) by P and transform to the Faddeev operator\nF =\u2212\n\n1X\n1 X 2\n\u2206i +\nri + V (I + P + P \u2020 ).\n2\n2 a4ho\ni\n\n(6)\n\ni\n\nIf \u03a8 is an eigenfunction of F , (I + P + P \u2020 )\u03a8 is an eigenfunction of H, provided it is nonzero. In case\n(I + P + P \u2020 )\u03a8 = 0, \u03a8 is called a spurious solution. We separate the center of mass motion, and consider\nthe relative system in hyperspherical coordinates. For that, we introduce Jacobi-coordinates according\nto\nq\nri,jk = 23 (ri \u2212 12 (rj + rk )),\n(7)\nq\nrjk = 12 (rj \u2212 rk ).\n(8)\n\n\f4\n\nThe hyperradius R and the hyperangle \u03b1 are defined by\n1 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(r + rjk\n+ rki\n) = ri,jk\n+ rjk\n,\n3 ij\n= R cos \u03b1i ,\n\n(10)\n\n= R sin \u03b1i .\n\n(11)\n\nR2 =\n2\nri,jk\n2\nrjk\n\n(9)\n\nThe remaining hyperspherical coordinates are given by the unit vectors r\u0302i,jk and r\u0302jk .\nWe restrict ourselves to states with zero total angular momentum. The advantage of considering\nthe Faddeev rather than the Schr\u00f6dinger operator is that subsystem angular momentum comes in\nonly at second order in the short-range potential [27]. This motivates us to neglect the subsystem\nangular momentum, by averaging over the Jacobi coordinates r\u0302i,jk and r\u0302jk . In this approximation, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger wavefunction \u03a8 (r1 , r2 , r3 ) is given in terms of reduced Faddeev wavefunctions \u03c8(R, \u03b1):\n\u03a8 (r1 , r2 , r3 ) = \u03c8(R, \u03b11 ) + \u03c8(R, \u03b12 ) + \u03c8(R, \u03b13 ).\n\n(12)\n\nIn the differential Faddeev equation [17] we then make an adiabatic hyperspherical expansion\n\u03c8(R, \u03b1) =\n\nX\n1\nfn (R)\u03c6n (R, \u03b1).\n2\u03c0R5/2 sin(2\u03b1) n\n\n(13)\n\nFor every value R, which is treated as a parameter, the functions \u03c6n (R, \u03b1) of hyperangle \u03b1 form a\ncomplete set, and are solutions to the eigenvalue equation on L2 ((0, \u03c0/2))\n\"\n#\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ 12 \u03c0\u2212| 16 \u03c0\u2212\u03b1|\n\u221a\n4\n\u22022\n\u03c6n (R, \u03b10 )d\u03b10 , (14)\n\u2212 2 \u2212 \u03bbn (R) \u03c6n (R, \u03b1) = \u22122R2 V ( 2R sin \u03b1) \u03c6n (R, \u03b1) + \u221a\n\u2202\u03b1\n3 | 13 \u03c0\u2212\u03b1|\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions \u03c6(R, 0) = \u03c6(R, \u03c0/2) = 0. The eigenvalues \u03bbn (R) depend parametrically on R. The set of hyperangular functions \u03c6n (R, \u03b1) are generally not orthogonal functions in \u03b1.\nTherefore, we define\nZ 21 \u03c0\nGnm (R) =\n\u03c6\u2217n (R, \u03b1)\u03c6m (R, \u03b1)d\u03b1,\n(15)\n0\n\nwhich allows us to derive the following coupled set of differential equations for the functions fn\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u22022\n15\n1 1 2 \u03bbn (R) \u2212 4\n1\n\u2212 2+\n+\nR\n+\nfn (R)+\n2\n\u2202R\n4R2\n2 a4ho\n2R2\n\u0015\nX\u0014\n\u2202\n+\n2Pnm (R)\n+ Qnm (R) fm (R) = Efn (R).

[22; 17], and the harmonic oscillator term\nis taken into account as in Ref. [21]. For now, we neglect the coupling terms conform the adiabatic\nhyperspherical approximation. However, later on we wil study the coupling between different channels\nmore carefully, as the harmonic oscillator gives rise to degeneracies between the Efimov-like solutions\nin the zeroth channel and the continuum-like solutions of the first and higher channels.\n\n\f5\n\nHyperangular problem\nThe effect of the interaction potential V is now encoded in the eigenfunctions \u03bbn (R). Parametric\nsolutions for \u03bbn can be found by fixing the parameter R, while solving for the angular problem. The\nfunctions \u03bbn (R) will then serve as input for the radial equation (16), and when the coupling terms are\nignored, solutions are obtained by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE).\nTo find an approximation of \u03bbn , one can study solutions \u03c8(R, \u03b1) of Eq. (14) for small values of \u03b1\nand values of \u03b1 close enough to \u03c0/2. Matching of the solutions at intermediate values of \u03b1 then yields\nan approximation of \u03bbn . This procedure has been described in Ref. [22]. The equation found in this\nmanner is\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u221a \u22121/2\n8 \u22121/2\n1/2 \u03c0\n1/2 \u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n=\n\u2212\n2\u03bb\n(18)\nsin\n\u03bb\nsin\n\u03bb\ncos \u03bb1/2\nn\nn 6\nn\nn 2 R kR cot(\u03b4(kR )),\nn 2\n3\np\nwhere kR = \u03bbn /2R2 . Note that \u03bbn \u2261 16 always solves this equation, but it gives rise to a spurious\nsolution. The right hand side of equation (18) can be conveniently expanded using the effective range\napproximation for the s-wave scattering phase shift of the two-body problem\n1 1\n2\n4\nkR cot \u03b4(kR ) = \u2212 + rs kR\n+ O(kR\n),\na 2\n\n(19)\n\nwith rs the effective range parameter. When this parameter is neglected, we find the approximating\nequation for \u03bbn = \u03bbn (R/a) that is at the basis of the derivation in Ref. [22]:\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u221a\n\u0011\n\u0010\n8 \u22121/2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 R\n\u03c0\nsin \u03bb1/2\n(R) sin \u03bb1/2\n.\n(20)\n= 2\u03bb\u22121/2\ncos \u03bb1/2\nn 6\nn\nn 2\nn 2 \u2212 \u221a \u03bbn\na\n3\nBy taking into account the effective range as well, one obtains an approximation that is more accurate\nwith respect to the two-body physics near narrow Feshbach resonances. This has been proposed in\nRef. [28] as a regularization procedure and has been readdressed in Ref. [29]. We will come back to\nthis issue in Section 4.\nHyperradial problem\nWith the approximation of the channel eigenvalues at hand, we may turn to the hyperradial problem. In the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation, we ignore the coupling between the different\nhyperradial channels and only take the scattering length into account in the approximation of \u03bbn . In\nthis setting, the Efimov effect was derived in Ref. [22], and repeating it in this context allows for a\ncomparison in the limit of aho \u2192 \u221e. The uncoupled system of equations is given by\n\nh\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bbn (R) \u2212\n\u22022\n+\n2\n\u2202R\nR2\n\n1\n4\n\n+\n\nR2 i\nfn (R) = 2Efn (R),\na4ho\n\n(21)\n\non (R0 , \u221e), with a boundary condition\nfn (R) \u2192 0,\n\nR \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(22)\n\nand an appropriate boundary condition on the edge of the inner region R0 where the short-range\npotentials become important, which is given in terms of the three-body parameter \u03ba\u2217 . The exact\nboundary condition will be specified later.\nWe first concentrate on the zeroth channel, i.e. n = 0, which is the only channel that has an\nattractive potential, and therefore the only channel in which the Efimov effect is found. We introduce\nspherical coordinates (T, \u03b8, \u03be) according to\nK = T sin \u03b8 sin \u03be,\n1\n= T sin \u03b8 cos \u03be,\na\n1\n= T cos \u03b8.\naho\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n(23c)\n\n\f6\n\nand write down the differential equation for f (\u03c3) = f0 (\u03c3/T ) as\n\nh\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bb0 (\u03c3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03be) \u2212\n\u22022\n+\n2\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u03c32\n\n1\n4\n\ni\n+ cos4 \u03b8 \u03c3 2 f (\u03c3) = 2 sgn (\u03be) sin2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03bef (\u03c3),\n\n(24)\n\nwith long-range boundary condition\nf (\u03c3) \u2192 0,\n\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(25)\n\nFor small values of \u03c3, the model does not provide us with a natural\n\u221a boundary condition.

Only three surfaces are shown, but in fact there is an infinite number of them, which all can be mapped\non top of each other by multiplying the distance to the origin by powers of e\u03c0/s0 . These surfaces are sliced by\na plane (red transparant), for a given aho that corresponds to the height of the plane. The intersection lines\n(red) represent bound state solutions for combinations of the scattering length a and the wave vector K, for\nthis value of aho . The picture is not too scale: we used similar scaling relations as used in Fig. 1 in order to\nshow the surfaces more clearly.\n\nWe may determine for which parameter combinations a solution exists by a shooting method from\nlarge values of \u03c3. A particular convenient method makes use of a certain phase variable \u03c6. One can set\nup an equation for \u03c6 that is much alike the variable phase equation, but is adapted to fit the boundary\ncondition at short distances very well. Henceforth, it will play a role similar to the function \u2206 as we\nmentioned in the introduction. We introduce the transformation\n\n\u0001\nf 0 (\u03c3) = g(\u03c3) + h(\u03c3) cot(\u03c6(\u03c3) + \u03c8(\u03c3)) f (\u03c3).\n\n(28)\n\n\f7\n\n10\n\n\u00d1\u03a9\n\nET\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\naho\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\na\nFig. 3 The trimer bound state energies of cesium in the zeroth and first hyperspherical channels.

Given values for \u03be and \u03b8, we denote by \u03c6(\u03c3; \u03be, \u03b8)\nthe solution to (32) that satisfies \u03c6(\u03c3) + s0 log \u03c3 + \u03b10 \u2191 0. With this definition, the problem (2) has a\nsolution if and only if\n\u03c6(T R0 ; \u03be, \u03b8) = s0 log(\u03ba\u2217 /T ) mod \u03c0.\n(33)\nConsequently, eigensolutions only exist if there exists an n \u2208 Z such that\nT = \u03ba\u2217 e\u2212\u03c6(T R0 ;\u03be,\u03b8)/s0 e\u2212n\u03c0/s0 .\n\n(34)\n\nWe would like to emphasize here the similarity with the description of the Efimov effect in free space\ngiven by equation (4). Using the asymptotic behavior of \u03bb0 for small arguments, one can easily show\nthat \u03c6(\u03c3) converges to a finite value for \u03c3 \u2193 0. The function \u03c6(0; \u03be, \u03b8) can be shown to be continuous\nover the region. For \u03b8 = 0 and \u03be \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/4], the Efimov effect in free space is retained. Hence,\n\u03c6(0; \u03be, 0) is an approximation of \u2212\u2206(\u03be)/2.\nTrimer solutions in a harmonic potential\nThe trimer solutions are most easily represented by surfaces in three-dimensional (a\u22121 , K, a\u22121\nho )\nspace, as defined in Eq. (23). In Fig. 2 such surfaces are shown for the lowest channel, which can be\n\n\f8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n\u00d1\u03a9\n\nET\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\naho\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\na\nFig. 4 Crossings in Fig. 3 are replaced by avoided crossings when the coupling between the zeroth and first\nhyperspherical channels is taken into account.\n\nmapped on top of each other by multiplication of the distance to the origin by powers of e\u03c0/s0 . Fig. 2\ncan be regarded as a generalization of the two-dimensional Fig. 1. When these surfaces are sliced with\na plane corresponding to a fixed harmonic oscillator length aho , we obtain curves that express wave\nvectors K in terms of the scattering length a, and an example can be seen in Fig. 3. When taking\nthe limit of aho \u2192 \u221e, the Efimov effect in free space is obtained as depicted in Fig. 1. In the region\n\u03be \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/4], the intersections of the surfaces will tend to the curves that describe the Efimov states.\nIn the region \u03be \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0/4, \u03c0), the energy levels come closer and closer together, expressing the fact that\nin the limit, this region is filled with continuum states. The intersection of the surfaces with the a\u22121 = 0\nplane precisely corresponds to the exact results obtained by Jonsell et al. and Werner [21; 30].\nAs an example, we show in Fig. 3 the trimer binding energies of cesium as a function of scattering\nlength with a fixed oscillator length, for the lowest and next to lowest hyperspherical channels. The\nparameters are \u03ba\u2217 = 1.93 \u00d7 10\u22124 a\u22121\n[2], with a0 the Bohr radius, R0 = 100a0 , and aho = 13000a0 ,\n0\nwhich corresponds to a trap frequency of approximately 1000 s\u22121 .\nIt is interesting to note the change of energy scales in this figure. Below the thresholds of the\ntrimer and atom-dimer continuum (cf. Fig. 1), which would exist for the free-space Efimov effect, the\nbound states show the characteristic scaling law of Eq. 2. Above these thresholds, the bound states\nshow a spacing typical for the harmonic oscillator potential which is approximately 2~\u03c9. This change\nof exponential scaling to linear scaling of the trimer energies makes that the accumulation of bound\nstates in the point of zero energy and infinite scattering length disappears. Effectively, the Efimov\ntrimers are \"pushed\" out of the trimer region through the thresholds and aquire a strong harmonic\noscillator state character.\nThere is also a clear difference between the zeroth and first hyperspherical channels. In this respect,\nit is interesting to note the different limiting behavior of the solutions for small positive and negative\nscattering length. For small and negative scattering length, there is no weakly-bound dimer state\nin the interatomic potential, and the solutions have the character of three weakly-interacting atoms\nin a harmonic oscillator potential. For small and positive scattering length, there is a weakly-bound\ndimer state, and for the zeroth hyperspherical channel the solutions have the character of a weaklyinteracting dimer and an atom in a harmonic oscillator potential. These regimes are connected through\nsolutions which have a strong Efimov character. However, for the first hyperspherical channel the\nsituation is different. Here the solutions behave more as those of two particles undergoing a Feshbach\nresonance [31; 32], which as a result interpolate between two different harmonic oscillator levels.\n\n\f9\n\n10\n\nGT \u0090\u00d1 \u03a9\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n10-4\n10-5\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\naho \u0090a\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFig. 5 The width \u0393T of cesium Efimov states in a trap, with \u03c9 = 1000 s\u22121 and \u03b7\u2217 = 0.06, for the first (red),\nsecond (black), third (green) and fourth (blue) trimer states depicted in Fig. 3. Also, the width of a free Efimov\ntrimer corresponding to the first state is shown (black dashed).\n\nIt should be possible to investigate this change of character experimentally, by using similar techniques as have been done by St\u00f6ferle et al. [32]. Here the creation of dimers was investigated in an\noptical lattice while sweeping the magnetic field through a Feshbach resonance. For the trimers, such\nadiabatic sweeps through trimer solutions should allow for a creation of states with a character changing\nbetween harmonic oscillator-, Efimov- and dimer+atom- type solutions.\nSo far, we have applied the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation, in which we completely ignored\nthe coupling between the various hyperspherical channels. While this is generally a good approximation,\nwe see from Fig. 3 that there are degeneracies between the zeroth and first channel solutions, which\nshould be lifted when the coupling is taking into account. In order to demonstrate this, we introduce\nan approximation of the coupling. We calculate the coupling terms Pmn and Qmn of Eq. (17) using\nfirst order approximations of the functions \u03c6n , and find in this way combined solutions which involve\nboth channels. In free-space, the coupling between these two hyperspherical channels is directly related\nto the process of three-body recombination, where three colliding particles relax into a weakly-bound\ndimer and a third particle, with a surplus of kinetic energy [17]. Interestingly, for our lattice solutions\nwe observe that this coupling transforms the crossings in Fig. 3 into avoided crossings, as shown in\nFig. 4. This could be experimentally interesting, since using magnetic field sweeps would allow for\nadiabatic transitions from one hyperspherical channel to an other.\n\n3 Stability of trimers in a harmonic potential\nThe change of character of the trimer solutions, which was discussed above, will have a profound\nimpact on the stability of these states. So far, we implicitly assumed that the trimers in the harmonic\noscillator potential are stable. However, when the three particles are close together the trimer can\ndissociate into a deeply-bound dimer and a third atom, with large kinetic energy. Here, we investigate\nthe stability of the trimers by applying the method of Braaten and Hammer [17], that regards the\ntrimers as scattering resonances in a dimer-atom scattering process. In this respect, the trimer energy\nET acquires a width \u0393T , where the latter can be used to calculate the lifetime ~/\u0393T of the trimers. In\nthis method, an inelasticity parameter \u03b7\u2217 is introduced to account for the decay into various deeply\nbound states. which can be regarded as the imaginary part of a complex phase factor that describes\nthe reflection of hyperradial waves in the inner region. Effectively, this comes down to changing the\nboundary condition at R0 to\nf 0 (R0 )\n1\ns0\n=\n+\ncot (s0 log(\u03ba\u2217 R0 ) + \u03b10 + i\u03b7\u2217 ) .\nf (R0 )\n2R0\nR0\n\n(35)\n\n\f10\n\nFor given values for the scattering length and the harmonic oscillator length, we are then able to find\nthe associated complex eigenvalues\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393T\nm\nE = 2 ET \u2212 i\n,\n(36)\n~\n2\nwhere the trimer energy ET < 0 and the width \u0393T > 0.\nAs an example, we calculated the linewidths or cesium, with a trapping frequency \u03c9 = 1000 s\u22121 ,\n\u03ba\u2217 = 1.93 \u00d7 10\u22124 a0 , and \u03b7\u2217 = 0.06 [2]. The short-range boundary condition was implemented at a\nvalue R0 = 100a0 . For some of the Efimov trimers shown in Fig. 3, the linewidths are shown in Fig. 5.\nThe change of character of the trimers can be clearly seen from this graph: for values a/aho . \u22122 the\nstates have a harmonic oscillator character, and the widths are relatively small. However, the Efimov\neffect shows up via a strong increase of the widths towards a/aho & \u22122, which is the parameter region\nwhere in free-space a new Efimov state would enter the tree-body system. It is also the region where\na local peak in the three-body recombination rate would occur (trimer resonance). Here, we see that\nat this point the width of the lowest trimer keeps increasing, while for the higher trimer states the\nwidth saturates and displays an oscilating behavior. This is not surprising, since the latter trimers are\nmore similar to three-particle continuum states. For comparison, the linewidth of the free-space Efimov\ntrimer compared to the lowest lattice trimer state is shown in the region where it exists. These lines\noverlap mostly, and can be more than two orders of magnitude above the widths for the higher trimer\nstates. At the point where the trimer energies approach the atom-dimer threshold, around a/aho = 34,\nthe widths go down again to the level of the higher trimer states. The width of the lattice trimer is\nthere somewhat larger than the free-space trimer, probably due to the additional confinement of the\nweakly-bound dimer state caused by the lattice.\nWhile the Efimov effect shows up in the excited states by a clear deviation from the harmonic\noscillator levels, these states benefit from a much smaller linewidth than the deeply bound Efimov\ntrimers, and they should therefore be easier to study experimentally. Also the lowest trimer energy,\nwhich most closely follows a free-space Efimov state, could be easier to study in experiment. The trimer\ncould first be prepared in the lowest harmonic oscillator level for a/aho \u001c \u22121, and then the scattering\nlenght can be changed via a magnetic field sweep to the region a/aho \u2248 \u22122, where the decay is still\nmanageable.\n\n4 Effective range corrections\nIn order to improve the approximation of the channel eigenvalues \u03bbn arising in (14), one might want\nto include the influence of the effective range rs . This can be done by making the so-called effective\nrange expansion, i.e. using the expansion in Eq. (19) up to second order. In literature there have been\nvarious instances in which the effective range is taken into consideration in the determination of the\nthree-particle spectrum [33; 34].\nHaving an additional interaction parameter at hand, raises the question whether in this regime\nEfimov physics in ultracold gases can still be universal. On the experimental side, there are presently\nalso some conflicting observations. In order to understand these issues, we first need to define what we\nmean by the universal Efimov regime. In the above, we have already seen that besides the scattering\nlength, we need at least one additional parameter that fixes at least one of the Efimov trimer energies.\nThe other ones can then be derived from this position. This information is provided via the threebody parameter \u03ba\u2217 , which can be regarded as a boundary condition for the interaction potentials in\nthe regime where the three particles are very close together. It is related to the energy of the lowest\nEfimov trimer via ET = \u2212~2 \u03ba2\u2217 /m in the infinite scattering length limit, and with this only additional\nparameter the Efimov physics is universal.\nHowever, some experiments on three-body recombination do not imply universality. While the\nexperiments at Rice University did show the universal connection between Efimov states in 7 Li at one\nside of the resonance [8], the universality did not extend to the other side of the resonance. The Rice\ngroup was not alone in this observation: also in Florence [6] on 39 K, in Innsbruck [5] on 133 Cs, and in\nTokyo [13] on 6 Li this non-universality was observed. On the other hand, in three other experiments\nuniversality across the resonance was observed: in Bar-Ilan it was found that universality does extend\nacross a Feshbach resonance in 7 Li, and even that the short range physics encapsulated in \u03ba\u2217 is\n\n\f11\n\n100\n\n\u039bHR\u0090R0 L\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nR\u0090R0\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFig. 6 Eigenvalues \u03bb of F R depending on R/R0 , as calculated in three different ways. The blue lines represent\nthe approximations of the eigenvalues by a truncated Fourier expansion. The black lines and red lines are the\napproximations obtained by (20) and (37) respectively. We take for the square well parameters V0 R02 = \u22123.2.\nIt can be clearly seen that the effective range gives a much better asymptotic behavior.\n\nindependent of the nuclear spin configuration [35; 36]. Furthermore universality was also observed in\na three-component fermionic 6 Li gas in Heidelberg [9] and in State College [11].\nNow the question arises whether the effective range paramer rs can explain, in addition to the\nthree-body parameter \u03ba\u2217 , the non-universal behavior of some of the above-mentioned experiments.\nHowever, it might also be that in a certain regime, the effective range will take over the role of the\nthree-body parameter due to its regularising effect of the radial wavefunctions [33; 34]. And recently, it\nhas been shown that small experimental deviations from universality [35] can be explained by effective\nrange corrections using an effective field theory [37].\nAs it has been shown by Fedorov and Jensen [28] and more recently by Platter et al. [29], the\nintroduction of the effective range in the approximate equation (18) for the eigenvalues \u03bbn yields the\nrelation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0012 R 1 \u03bb \u0013\n\u221a \u22121/2\n8 \u22121/2\nn\n1/2 \u03c0\n1/2 \u03c0\n1/2 \u03c0\ncos \u03bbn 2 \u2212 \u221a \u03bbn\nsin \u03bbn 6 = \u2212 2\u03bbn\nsin \u03bbn 2\n\u2212 + rs\n.\n(37)\na\n2 2R\n3\nTo get an idea on the validity of the approximation (37), we have compared the results with the\neigenvalues obtained by a truncated Fourier expansion for a square well potential with height V0 and\nwidth R0 , such that V0 R02 = \u22123.2.

For R . \u2212rs , there is a\nboundary layer, in which the solution resembles the solution \u03bc of (42) (blue, dashed).\n\nIn Fig. 6, we compare the numerically calculated eigenvalues \u03bbn (R) of F R with results obtained from\nEq. (20), which depends on the scattering length only, and with the results from solving Eq. (37),\nwhich depends both on scattering length and effective range. Here the values for a and rs are taken\nfrom the effective range expansion of the square well potential. It can be seen that asymptotically,\nthat is for large hyperradius, the inclusion of the effective range in the model yields results that are\nconsiderably better than if one only takes the scattering length into account. For relatively small values\nof the hyperradius, the predictions obtained by the Fourier expansion and this simple model start to\ndeviate. Hence, we expect that for short hyperradii, additional details of the interaction potential\nbecome important, i.e. higher order expansion coefficients beyond the effective range approximation\nhave to be taken into account.\nFor rs < 0 and a fixed value for a, the lowest solution \u03bb0 to Eq. (37) can be defined as a smooth\nfunction of R for R \u2208 (0, \u221e). Moreover, \u03bb0 (R) = O(R) as R \u2192 0. Therefore, if we use this approximation in the hyperradial equation, we can find regular solutions instead of rapidly oscillating ones. This\ncould, at least in principle, remove the need for a renormalization boundary condition in terms of \u03ba\u2217 for\nR \u2192 0. In the absence of a harmonic oscillator, and in the limits of small energy and r \u2261 \u2212rs /a \u2192 0,\nwe will see that the solutions to the hyperradial equation are identical to those when the effective\nrange is not taken into account, except that the value of \u03ba\u2217 is determined by rs by boundary layer\nbehavior for small values of the hyperradius. Such a relation between \u03ba\u2217 and rs has been established\nbefore [33; 34].\nLet us, therefore, study the equation (37) more closely. We have plotted the solution \u03bb0 for the\nsituation a = \u221220rs in Fig. 7, to give a characteristic example. In the region \u2212rs \u001c R . a, the value\nof \u03bb0 satisfying (37) is close to that obtained by solving (20). Similarly, when R \u001c \u2212rs , the solution\n\u03bb0 to (37) will be close to \u03bc(\u2212R/rs ), where \u03bc(\u2212R/rs ) is the solution to\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 1 \u03bc\n\u0010\n\u221a \u22121/2\n8\n1/2 \u03c0\n\u03c0\n=\n\u2212\n2\u03bb\nsin\n\u03bc\nrs\n.\ncos \u03bc1/2 \u03c02 \u2212 \u221a \u03bc\u22121/2 sin \u03bb1/2\nn 6\nn\n2\n2 2R\n3\n\n(42)\n\nAround R \u223c \u2212rs , there is a transition from a boundary layer behavior similar to \u03bc to behavior obtained\nby ignoring the effective range (20).\nTo find the low-energy behavior of the system, which is needed to find a proper relationship between\nrs and \u03ba\u2217 [33; 34], we have to turn back to the hyperradial equation (21). Following from the above\nconsiderations, the solution f0 that decays exponentially for large hyperradius is to leading order in\n\u2212rs /a, and for R \u001d \u2212rs , equal to f out , the exponentially decaying solution to the hyperradial equation\nobtained when the effective range is ignored. This outer solution f out will have log-periodic behavior\nas R \u2192 0\n\u221a\nf out (R) \u223c R sin(s0 log(\u03baR) + \u03b10 ),\n(43)\nfor some \u03ba. The solution f0 will be similar for \u2212rs \u001c R \u001c a, and will therefore for low enough energies\nalso show log-periodic behavior. However, there is a boundary layer for R \u001c \u2212rs , which\nmakes that we\n\u221a\ncan demand the solution f0 (R) to be regular for R \u2192 0, that is, such that f0 (R) \u223c R for R \u2192 0. This\n\n\f13\n\neffectively determines the value of \u03ba. To analyze the boundary layer, we introduce the new variable\n\u03c1 = \u2212R/rs and the function f \u03030 , f \u03030 (\u03c1) = f0 (\u2212\u03c1rs ). The hyperradial equation for f \u03030 reads\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2\n\u03bb0 (\u03c1) \u2212 1/4\nrs4 2\n2  \u0303\n\u2212 2+\n+ 4 \u03c1 \u2212 2Ers f0 (\u03c1) = 0,\n(44)\nd\u03c1\n\u03c12\naho\n\u221a\nand we demand that f \u03030 (\u03c1) behaves like \u03c1 for \u03c1 \u2192 0. We consider now the case of a negligible harmonic\noscillator potential, i.e. aho = \u221e, and take the low-energy limit Ers2 \u2192 0 and a diverging scattering\nlength. The solution will then be equal to f0in , which satisfies\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bc(\u03c1) \u2212 1/4 in\nd2\nf0 (\u03c1) = 0.\n(45)\n\u2212 2+\nd\u03c1\n\u03c12\nFor \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e,\nlim f0in (\u03c1) \u223c\n\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c1 sin(s0 log(\u03c1) + \u03c60 ).\n\nWe determine the phase \u03c60 numerically, by choosing a boundary condition\n\u00130\n\u0012\n\u03bc(\u03c1) f (\u03c1)\nf (\u03c1)\n=\n\u221a\n\u221a ,\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\nfor small enough values of \u03c1, and by integrating the equation. The boundary condition ensures that\nwe pick up the right solution. The result is \u03c60 = s0 log(1.0918) + \u03b10 . In order to find what value of \u03ba\u2217\n(= \u03ba in this limit) is induced by rs , we have to match the inner and the outer solutions in the regime\nwhere \u2212rs \u001c R \u001c a. This yields that \u2212\u03ba\u2217 rs = 1.0918.\nRemarkably, this numerical value for \u2212\u03ba\u2217 rs differs from the values obtained in Ref. [33] and [34],\nwhich are \u2212\u03ba\u2217 rs \u2248 5 and \u2212\u03ba\u2217 rs \u2248 5.3062 respectively. It is unclear where the difference comes from,\nhowever, both papers use models different from the hyperspherical formalism that we used here, where\nwe base our treatment of the effective range parameter on the descriptions in Refs. [28] and [29]. More\nresearch is needed to resolve this discrepancy.\nNow we are in a good position to compare our model with earlier work on the Efimov effect in a\nharmonic potential. In the work of Th\u00f8gersen, Fedorov, and Jensen, the influence of the effective range\nis studied on the universal Efimov effect [25]. They considered a system with a Gaussian interaction\npotential, given by\nV (r) = V0 exp(\u2212r2 /R02 ),\n(48)\nwhere V0 and R0 are constants. The range R0 has been chosen to equal R0 = aho /3965.\nAlthough the main purpose of Ref. [25] is to show the influence of the effective range, their model\ncontains a harmonic trap as well. In order to make a proper comparison with our model, we take\n\u03ba\u2217 aho = 3.7. The results are shown in Figs. 8 and Fig. 9, and can be directly compared with Fig. 1\nin Ref. [25]. We observe that the numerical results are reproduced quite closely and we can assign the\nnumerically found bound states to the different hyperspherical channels. We also observed that if we\ninclude the above corrections that come from the effective range, the comparison is better than results\nobtained without these corrections.\n5 Conclusion\nWe studied the Efimov effect in a harmonic potential by using the hyperspherical formulation. In the\nfirst part of this paper, we studied the universal regime by only taking a large scattering length into\naccount, and by making the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation in that we ignored the coupling\nbetween different hyperspherical channels. The model thus obtained is simple in the sense that the\nbinding energies of the trimers result from an ordinary differential equation, with an appropriate\nboundary condition for the lowest channel encoded by the three-body parameter \u03ba\u2217 . Considering the\nlowest channel, we formulate an equation for a phase variable, the exponent of which is the radius\nin a spherical plot describing a surface of values in (a\u22121 , K, a\u22121\nho )-space (inverse scattering length,\nwavenumber and inverse oscillator length) for which bound states exists. Other such surfaces are\nobtained by multiplying the distance to the origin by a factor e\u03c0/s0 , and there is an accumulation\n\n\f14\n\n7\n6\n\nET \u0090\u00d1 \u03a9\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\nsgnHaL\u00c8aho \u0090a\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\u00904\n\nFig. 8 Trimer solutions in a harmonic oscillator, for potential parameters corresponding to the paper of\nTh\u00f8gersen et al.

In the limit aho \u2192 \u221e,\nthe Efimov effect in free space is recovered.\nInteresting differences with the situation of three particles in free space can be observed when we\nfocus at a fixed value of aho . For parameter combinations where in free-space bound states would exist,\nthe situation is very similar, except that the accumulation of energies only happens up to a typical\nenergy of ~\u03c9. The rest of the Efimov states are \"pushed out\" into the trimer continuum (which is of\ncourse only a continuum in free space). Higher hyperspherical channels give rise to additional bound\nstates, and by taking those into account as well we obtain results very close to numerical simulations\nof three-particle systems [25]. Better qualitative results are obtained by approximating the coupling\nbetween the hyperspherical channels, which lifts the degeneracies and creates avoided crossings. The\nlifetime of the trimers is highest for states with a continuum character, i.e. in the region which we\nwould denote as trimer continuum in free space. The reason for this is the small overlap of these states\nwith deeply bound states. Experimental study of Efimov-like states, however, could be feasible close to\nthe transition from this continuum region to the trimer region, where the linewidth is still quite small.\n\n\f15\n\nFor a more general Efimov model that allows for deviations from the universal regime, a natural step\nis to improve on the approximation of the hyperangular problem by taking into account the effective\nrange. By doing this, we were able to find a relation between \u03ba\u2217 and the effective range rs < 0 if\na \u001d \u2212rs \u001d R0 , where R0 is a typical range of the potential. We obtain the same qualitative behavior\nas Ref. [33] and [34] where different descriptions were used, however, the actual value of \u03bars is also\nvery different. It appears that the actual value for this relationship depends strongly on the choice\nof the model and the corresponding approximations to describe the three-particle physics, and more\nresearch is needed to understand this discrepancy. In a different parameter regime for a, rs and R0 ,\nsuch a relationship between \u03ba\u2217 and rs is not necessary. Then we have in addition to rs , the three-body\nparameter \u03ba\u2217 in the boundary condition for the hyperradial problem to our disposal. By comparing to\nnumerical calculations we find that this description indeed improves the predicted trimer energies.\nReferences\n1. V. Efimov, Phys. Lett. B 33, 563 (1970); V. Efimov, Sov. J. Nucl.
