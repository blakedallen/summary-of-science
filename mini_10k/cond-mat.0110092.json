It is based on density functional theory and on the gauge including projector augmented\nwave (GIPAW) approach to the calculation of all-electron magnetic response. The method is validated by comparison with existing quantum chemical and experimental data for a selection of\ndiatomic radicals. We then perform the first prediction of EPR g-tensors in the solid state and\nfind the results to be in excellent agreement with experiment for the E1\u2032 and substitutional P defect\ncenters in quartz.\n\nTo achieve this we introduced the gauge including projector augmented wave (GIPAW) method, which is an\nextension of Bl\u00f6chl's projector augmented wave (PAW)\nmethod [10]. In Ref. [9], we used GIPAW to compute\nthe NMR chemical shifts in molecules and solids. Here,\nwe apply the GIPAW approach to the first principles\nprediction of EPR g-tensors for paramagnetic defects in\nsolids. We validate our theory and implementation for\ndiatomic radicals, for which both all-electron quantum\nchemical calculations and experimental data exist. As,\nuntil now, there have been no first principles calculations\nof g-tensors in solids, we validate our method in the solid\nstate by a direct comparison with experiment. In particular, we interpret, from first principles, the EPR spectrum\nof the well characterized and technologically important\ndefects in quartz, the E1\u2032 and P substitutional centers.\nThe g-tensor is an experimentally defined quantity,\narising from the recognition that the EPR spectrum can\nbe modeled using the following effective Hamiltonian, bilinear in the total electron spin S, and the applied uniform magnetic field or nuclear spins, B and II , respectively:\nX\n\u03b1\nHeff = S * g * B +\nS * AI * II .\n(1)\n2\n\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), also known\nas electron spin resonance (ESR), is the most powerful\nspectroscopic technique for the study of paramagnetic\ndefects in solids. Indeed, defect centers are often named\ndirectly after their EPR spectra. Applications of EPR\nextend to any situation where there are unpaired electrons, including the understanding of reactions involving\nfree radicals in both biological and chemical contexts or\nthe study of the structure and spin state of transition\nmetal complexes.\nEPR spectra of spin 1/2 centers are made up of two\ncontributions: (i) the hyperfine parameters, which can\nbe computed from the ground state spin density, and\nhave been used to connect theoretical studies of defects\nto available experimental data [1\u20136], and (ii) the g-tensor.\nOnly recently have there been attempts to calculate the\ng-tensor in molecules from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) [7,8]. However, these approaches are valid only for finite systems and, thus, are\nnot useful for the calculation of the g-tensor for paramagnetic defects in solids, except possibly within a cluster\napproximation. In the absence of a predictive scheme,\nexperimentally determined g-tensors are, of necessity, interpreted in terms of their symmetry alone, leaving any\nremaining information unexploited. A reliable, first principles approach to the prediction of g-tensors in solids, in\ncombination with structural and energetic calculations,\nwould access this information, and could be used for\nan unequivocal discrimination between competing microscopic models proposed for defect centers. In this letter we describe an approach for the calculation of the\ng-tensor in extended systems, using periodic boundary\nconditions and super-cells.\nIn a previous paper [9] we have shown how to compute the all-electron magnetic linear response, in finite\nand extended systems, using DFT and pseudopotentials.\n\nI\n\nHere, and in the following, atomic units are used, \u03b1 is the\nfine structure constant, and the summation I runs over\nthe nuclei. The tensors AI are the hyperfine parameters (a PAW based theory for its calculation has been\ndescribed elsewhere by Van de Walle and Bl\u00f6chl [1,3]),\nand the tensor g is the EPR g-tensor.\nIn order to calculate the g-tensor we start from the\nelectronic Hamiltonian which includes terms up to order\n\u03b13 , in the presence of a constant external magnetic field\nB [11,7]:\n\n1\n\n\f\uf8f1\nX \uf8f2 [pi + \u03b1A(ri )]2\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd removing the contribution from the current of the unX\nZI\n1\n(1)\n(1)\nH=\n\u2212\n+\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe paired electron, [j\u2191 (r) \u2212 j\u2193 (r)].\n2\n|r\n\u2212\nR\n|\n|r\n\u2212\nr\n|\ni\nI\ni\nj\ni\nI\nj6=i\nWe can interpret the physical origin of deviation of the\n+HZ + HZ\u2212KE + HSO + HSOO .\n(2) g-tensor from its value in vacuum.

As in previous calculations [2,3,18], we model\nthe defect with a 71 atom (24 Si and 47 O), positively\ncharged (+1) hexagonal super-cell. We use the theoretical GGA-PBE lattice parameters (which are 1% larger\nthan in experiment) and relax the atoms. For the structural optimization we use a \u0393 only k-point sampling and\na plane-wave cutoff of 50 Ry. The resulting relaxed structure is very close to that of Ref. [3]. The EPR g-tensor is\ncalculated using our relaxed structure, a plane-wave cutoff of 70 Ry and 4 inequivalent k-points. In Table II we\ncompare our theoretical g-tensor with the experimental\nresults [16], finding excellent agreement.\nThe P2 defect center is neutral and assocated to a fourfold coordinated P atom, substituting for a Si atom. The\ncenter exists as two variants at low temperature (<140K)\nin quartz, labelled P2(I) in the ground state and P2(II)\nin the excited state [20]. Only recently have these P defect centers been examined using DFT based total energy\napproaches [6,4]. However, up until now, the connection\nwith experiment has been made using the eigenvalues of\nthe hyperfine parameters alone, and the two variants of\nthe defects, P2(I) and P2(II), have not been distinguished\ntheoretically.\nUsing the method described above, and a super-cell of\n72 atoms, 5 distinct total energy local minima are found\nas a function of the initial configuration, Table III. The\nconfiguration with the highest energy corresponds to a\nsymmetric relaxation with the P remaining tetrahedrally\ncoordinated, and O-P-O angles of about 109\u25e6 . In the 4\nother configurations the P atom moves off-center, opening up one of the 6 O-P-O angles, which reaches a value\nof about 150\u25e6 . We computed the EPR g-tensors for our\ntwo lowest energy structures and compare them with the\nexperimental results [20] in Table IV. Again, we obtain\nan excellent agreement between theory and experiment,\nwhich confirms that the two lowest energy theoretical\nstructures correspond to the two lowest energy experimental structures. However, the comparison between gtensors shows that the energy ordering between the P2(I)\nand P2(II) species is not correctly described by theory.\nThis is not surprising given the small energy separation\nbetween the two configurations. This is expected to be\nsensitive to both the size of the super-cell and the use of\napproximated DFT functionals.\n\n(10)\n\nThe potentials V (r) and \u1e7c (r) in Eqs. (10) and (11) are\nthe screened atomic all-electron and local channel pseudopotentials respectively.\nThe evaluation of the paramagnetic correction term\n\u2206p\n\u2206gSO\nis more involved as it requires the first order linear response wavefunctions. However, the required evaluation can be described by analogy with the calculation\nof paramagnetic correction to the NMR chemical shifts,\n\u2206p\nI\n\u03c3GIPAW\n, replacing the weights fn,m\nin Eq. (60) of Ref.\n[9] by\nI\nfn,m\n= h\u03c6I,n |\n\ng \u2032 L \u2202 \u1e7c (r)\ng\u2032 L \u2202V (r)\n|\u03c6I,m i \u2212 h\u03c6\u0303I,n |\n|\u03c6\u0303I,m i,\n2 r \u2202r\n2 r \u2202r\n(11)\n\nwhere L is the angular momentum operator.\nThe electron Zeeman kinetic energy correction term\n\u2206gZ\u2212KE is evaluated by combining a straightforward\nPAW correction with the quantity evaluated from the\nground-state pseudo valence wavefunctions using Eq. (5).\nIn this work the SOO term is evaluated from the induced\nfield B(1) (r) derived from the bare induced current, and\nthe spin density due to the pseudo wavefunctions. It is\nexpected that a full GIPAW treatment would result in\nonly minor corrections since (i) the SOO term is small\nin comparison to the SO term, and (ii) both the induced\nfield and the spin density do not diverge at the nuclei.\nTo validate our new expressions for the evaluation of\nthe g-tensor, and our implementation of them into a\nparallelized plane-wave pseudopotential code, we compare with the all-electron gauge including atomic orbital\n(GIAO) DFT results obtained by Schreckenbach and\nZiegler [7] for a series of diatomic radicals. We use their\ncalculated bond lengths for the dimers, but approximate\nthe isolated dimers by using large super-cells. TroullierMartins pseudopotentials [14] and the (spin polarized)\ngeneralized gradient approximation due to Perdew et al\n[15] (GGA-PBE) are used throughout our calculations.\nTable I shows the excellent agreement between our two\napproaches. The exception is the AlO radical, for which\nwe obtain much closer agreement with experiment. The\notherwise close agreement between these two very different approaches suggests a technical rather than fundamental problem in the GIAO calculation for AlO. Comparison with experiment is made through Table 2 of Ref.\n[7], while acknowledging that most measurements are\nperformed in solid matrices, which strongly influence the\ng-tensor (most notably the \u2206gk components), and that\nthe experimental errors are of the order of several hundred parts per million (ppm).\n3\n\n\fTABLE I.

On applying\nthe method to the P2 defect, we show that comparison\nwith experimental g-tensors can provide structural information where the accuracy of DFT for energetics is\ninsufficient. Combined with the calculation of hyperfine\nparameters [1\u20136], we expect that our GIPAW based first\nprinciples approach to the prediction of EPR g-tensors\nwill be of great use in the assessment of models proposed\nfor less well characterized paramagnetic defects, and add\nsignificantly to the tools available to the electronic structure community.\nC.J.P. would like to thank the Universit\u00e9 Paris 6 and\nthe Universit\u00e9 Paris 7 for support during his stay in Paris.\nThe calculations were performed at the IDRIS supercomputing center of the CNRS and on Hodgkin (SGI\nOrigin 2000) at the University of Cambridge's High Performance Computing Facility.\n\nNc\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\nEnergy (meV)\n730\n243\n178\n79\n0\n\nspecies\n\nP2(I)\nP2(II)\n\nTABLE IV.
