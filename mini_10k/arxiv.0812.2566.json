For an R-module M , we use pdR (M ) to denote the classical\nprojective dimension of M . It is convenient to use \"local\" to refer to (not necessarily Noetherian)\nrings with a unique maximal ideal.\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with the Gorenstein homological dimension theory. Some\nreferences are [6, 7, 8, 13]. Nevertheless, it is convenient to give a brief history of the Gorenstein\ndimension theory.\nIn the sixties, Auslander and Bridger introduced an homological dimension, called G-dimension,\nfor finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings [1, 2]. Several decades later, this homological\ndimension was extended, by Enochs et al. [9, 10, 12], to Gorenstein projective dimension of modules\nthat are not necessarily finitely generated and over not necessarily Noetherian rings. And, dually,\nthey defined the Gorenstein injective dimension. Then, to complete the analogy with the classical\nhomological dimensions, Enochs et al. [11] introduced the Gorenstein flat dimension.\nIn the last years, the Gorenstein homological dimensions have become a vigorously active area of\nresearch (see [6] and [8] for more details). In 2004, Holm [13] generalized several results which are\nalready obtained over Noetherian rings to associative rings. Recently, in [3], the authors introduced a\nparticular case of Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules, which are defined, respectively,\nas follows:\n*Journal of Algebra and Its Applications, To appear\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. Bennis and N. Mahdou\n\nDefinition 1.1 ([3])\n\u2022 An R-module M is said to be strongly Gorenstein projective (SGprojective for short), if there exists an exact sequence of projective modules\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nP = * * * \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 * * *\nsuch that M \u223c\n= Im(f ) and such that HomR (\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence P exact whenever Q is\na projective R-module.\n\u2022 The strongly Gorenstein injective (SG-injective for short) modules are defined dually.\n\u2022 An R-module M is said to be strongly Gorenstein flat (SG-flat for short), if there exists an\nexact sequence of flat R-modules\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nF = * * * \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 * * *\nsuch that M \u223c\n= Im(f ) and such that I \u2297R \u2212 leaves the sequence F exact whenever I is an\ninjective right R-module.\nIt is proved that the class of all strongly Gorenstein projective modules is an intermediate class\nbetween the ones of projective modules and Gorenstein projective modules [3, Proposition 2.3]; i.e.,\nwe have the following inclusions\n{projective modules}\n\n\u2286\n\n{SG\u2212projective modules}\n\n\u2286\n\n{G\u2212projective modules}\n\nwhich are strict by [3, Examples 2.5 and 2.13]. The principal role of the strongly Gorenstein\nprojective, injective, and flat modules is to give a simple characterization of Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules, respectively (see [3, Theorems 2.7 and 3.5]). For example, we\nhave, in the Gorenstein projective case, that a module is Gorenstein projective if and only if it\nis a direct summand of a strongly Gorenstein projective module \u2217 . The strongly Gorenstein modules confirm that there is an analogy between the notion of \"Gorenstein projective, injective, and\nflat modules\"and the notion of the usual \"projective, injective, and flat modules\". This is, in\nfact obtained, because the strongly Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules have simpler\ncharacterizations than their Gorenstein correspondent modules [3, Propositions 2.9 and 3.6]. For\ninstance, a module M is strongly Gorenstein projective if and only if there exists a short exact\nsequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 P \u2192 M \u2192 0, where P is a projective module, such that the short sequence\n0 \u2192 Hom(M, Q) \u2192 Hom(P, Q) \u2192 Hom(M, Q) \u2192 0 is exact for any projective module Q.\nThe aim of this paper is to generalize the notion of \"strongly Gorenstein projective modules\"to\nn-strongly Gorenstein projective modules (Definition 2.1). We generalize some results of [3] (see\nTheorem 2.8 and Proposition 2.2), we establish some change of rings results (Theorem 2.10 and\nCorollary 2.11), and we give some examples of n-strongly Gorenstein projective modules over not\nnecessarily Noetherian rings (see Examples 2.4 and 2.6).\n\n2\n\nn-Strongly Gorenstein projective modules\n\nIn this section, we introduce and study n-strongly Gorenstein projective modules which are defined\nas follows:\n\u2217 In [3] the rings are assumed to be commutative. However, one can show easily that this assumption is\nnot necessary for some results such as the principal one [3, Theorem 2.7] and [3, Proposition 2.9], which we\nneed in this paper.\n\n\fA generalization of strongly Gorenstein projective modules\n\n3\n\nDefinition 2.1 Let n be a positive integer. An R-module M is said to be n-strongly Gorenstein\nprojective (n-SG-projective for short), if there exists an exact sequence of R-modules\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0,\nwhere each Pi is projective, such that HomR (\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q is a\nprojective R-module.\nConsequently, the 1-strongly Gorenstein projective modules are just the strongly Gorenstein\nprojective modules (by [3, Proposition 2.9]).\nRecall that a Gorenstein projective module is projective if and only if it has finite projective\ndimension [13, Proposition 2.27]. For the n-strongly Gorenstein projective modules, we have the\nfollowing result, which is a generalization of [3, Corollary 2.11].\nProposition 2.2 Let n be a positive integer. An n-strongly Gorenstein projective module is projective if and only if it has finite flat dimension.\nProof. The \"only if\" part is trivial.\nWe prove the \"if\" part. Let M be an n-strongly Gorenstein projective module with finite flat\ndimension. Then, there exists an exact sequence of modules\n(\u03b1)\n\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0,\n\nwhere each Pi is projective, and, by standard arguments, M is flat. We decompose the above\nsequence (\u03b1) into short exact sequences\n(\u03b1i )\n\n0 \u2192 Hi \u2192 Pi \u2192 Hi\u22121 \u2192 0,\n\nwhere Hn = M = H0 and Hi = Ker(PL\ni \u2192 Hi\u22121 ) for i = n \u2212 1, ..., 1. It is evident that each Hi is\nHi . Now, by adding the short exact sequences (\u03b1i ), we\nflat, so is the finite direct sum H =\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nobtain the following short exact sequence:\n0 \u2192 H \u2192 P \u2192 H \u2192 0,\nwhere P =\n\nL\n\nPi . Finally, [4, Theorem 2.5] gives the desired result.\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nCorollary 2.3 If R has finite weak dimension, then the class of all projective R-modules and the\nclass of all Gorenstein projective R-modules are the same class.\nProof. Apply Proposition 2.2 and [3, Theorem 2.7].\n\nThe following gives an example, over a not necessarily Noetherian ring, of a 1-strongly Gorenstein\nprojective module which is not projective.\nExample 2.4 Let R be a local ring and consider the ring S = R[[X]]/(X 2 ). Denote by X the\nresidue class in S of X. Then, the ideal (X) is strongly Gorenstein projective but it is not projective.\n\n\f4\n\nD. Bennis and N. Mahdou\n\nProof. First, since R is local, S is also local, and so the ideal (X) is not projective (since (X)2 = 0).\nNow, we prove that (X) is strongly Gorenstein projective.\nLet x be the homothety given by multiplication by X. We have the exact sequence:\nx\n\nx\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 * * *\nsuch that Ker x = Im x = (X).\nSince S is local, every projective S-module is free. Then, consider a free S-module S (I) , where I is\nan index set, and applying the functor HomS (\u2212, S (I) ) to the above sequence, we get the following\nsequence:\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Hom(S, S (I) )\n\nHomS (x,S (I) )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nHom(S, S (I) ) \u2212\u2192 * * *\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nBy the natural isomorphism Hom(S, S (I) ) \u2212\u2192 S (I) , we get the following commutative diagram:\n***\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n***\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nHom(S, S (I) )\n\u223c\n=\u2193\nS (I)\n\nHomS (x,S (I) )\n\n\u2212\u2192\nx\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nHom(S, S (I) )\n\u223c\n=\u2193\nS (I)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n***\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n***\n\nEvidently, the lower sequence in the diagram above is exact, then so is the upper sequence, which\nmeans that the ideal (X) is strongly Gorenstein projective.\nProposition 2.5 Let n be a positive integer.\n1. Every strongly Gorenstein projective module is n-strongly Gorenstein projective.\n2. Every n-strongly Gorenstein projective module is Gorenstein projective.\nProof. 1. Let M be a strongly Gorenstein projective module. Then, there exists, by [3, Proposition\nf\n\ng\n\n2.9], a short exact sequence: 0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0, where P is a projective module, such\nthat the short sequence 0 \u2192 Hom(M, Q) \u2192 Hom(P, Q) \u2192 Hom(M, Q) \u2192 0 is exact for any\nprojective module Q. Thus, we get an exact sequence:\nf\n\nf \u25e6g\n\nf \u25e6g\n\ng\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0,\nsuch that Hom(\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q is a projective module. This, shows\nthat M is n-strongly Gorenstein projective for every positive integer n.\n2. Let M be a n-strongly Gorenstein projective module. Then, there exists an exact sequence\nfn+1\n\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nn\n1\n2\nM \u2212\u2192 0,\n* * * \u2212\u2192\nP1 \u2212\u2192\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 Pn \u2212\u2192\n\nwhere each Pi is a projective module, such that Hom(\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q\nis a projective module. Thus, we get an exact sequence:\nf\n\n2\n* * * \u2212\u2192\nP1\n\nfn+1 \u25e6f1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nfn\n\nf\n\n2\nPn \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192\nP1\n\nfn+1 \u25e6f1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nfn\n\nPn \u2212\u2192 * * * ,\n\nsuch that Hom(\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q is a projective module. This shows\nthat M is Gorenstein projective.\nThe following is an extension of [3, Example 2.13], such that we give an example of 2-strongly\nGorenstein projective modules, over a not necessarily Noetherian ring, which are not 1-strongly\nGorenstein projective.\n\n\f5\n\nA generalization of strongly Gorenstein projective modules\n\nExample 2.6 Let R be a local ring and consider the ring S = R[[X, Y ]]/(XY ). Then:\n1. The two ideals (X) and (Y ) are 2-strongly Gorenstein projective, where X and Y are the\nresidue classes in S of X and Y , respectively.\n2. (X) and (Y ) are not strongly Gorenstein projective.\nProof. The proof of the statement (1) is similar to the one of Example 2.4. We only need to note\nthat we have two exact sequences:\n0\n0\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(X)\n(Y )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\nR\nR\n\ny\n\n\u2212\u2192\nx\n\u2212\u2192\n\nR\nR\n\nx\n\n\u2212\u2192\ny\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(X)\n(Y )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\n0\n0\n\nwhere x and y are the multiplications by X and Y , respectively.\nThe proof of the statement (2) is the same as the one of [3, Example 2.13 (2)].\n\nObviously, any example of an injective module which is not projective is an example of (strongly)\nGorenstein injective module which is not (strongly) Gorenstein projective. From the following,\nwhich is a generalization of [14, Exercise 4.2, p. 115], we can construct an example of an (n-strongly)\nGorenstein injective module which is neither injective nor (n-strongly) Gorenstein projective.\nProposition 2.7 If R is an integral domain but not a field, an R-module that is simultaneously\nGorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective must be 0.\nProof. Assume that an R-module M is simultaneously Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective. Then, as a Gorenstein projective R-module, M embeds in a projective R-module, and so it is\ntorsion-free (since R is an integral domain). On the other hand, as a Gorenstein injective R-module,\nM is a quotient of an injective R-module, and so it is divisible (by [14, Exercise 3.14, p. 69]). Thus,\nby [14, Exercise 3.19, p. 70], M is an injective R-module, then it is also projective (since it embeds\nin a projective R-module). Finally, by [14, Exercise 4.2, p. 115], M must be 0.\n\nThe next result is a characterization of n-strongly Gorenstein projective modules. It is a generalization of [3, Proposition 2.9].\nTheorem 2.8 For any module M and any positive integer n, the following are equivalent:\n1. M is n-strongly Gorenstein projective;\n2. There exists an exact sequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0, where each Pi is a\nprojective module, such that Hom(\u2212, Q\u2032 ) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q\u2032 is a module\nwith finite projective dimension;\n3. There exists an exact sequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0, where each Pi is a projective module, and there exists a positive integer j such that Extj+1 (M, Q) = Extj+2 (M, Q) =\n* * * = Extj+n (M, Q) = 0 for any projective module Q;\n4. There exists an exact sequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0, where each\nPi is a projective module, and there exists a positive integer j such that Extj+1 (M, Q\u2032 ) =\nExtj+2 (M, Q\u2032 ) = * * * = Extj+n (M, Q\u2032 ) = 0 for any module Q\u2032 with finite projective dimension.\n\n\f6\n\nD. Bennis and N. Mahdou\n\nProof. 1 \u21d4 2. Obviously the second condition is stronger than the first, then only the implication\n1 \u21d2 2 merits a proof. So, let M be an n-strongly Gorenstein projective module. Then, there exists\nan exact sequence\nP = 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0,\nwhere each Pi is a projective module, such that Hom(\u2212, Q) leaves the sequence exact whenever Q\nis a projective module. Let Q\u2032 be a module with pd(Q\u2032 ) = m < \u221e and consider a short exact\nsequence 0 \u2192 K \u2192 F \u2192 Q\u2032 \u2192 0, where F is a free module, then pd(K) = m \u2212 1. Thus,\n0 \u2192 Hom(P, K) \u2192 Hom(P, F ) \u2192 Hom(P, Q\u2032 ) \u2192 0\nis an exact sequence of complexes (the exactness of Hom(P, F ) \u2192 Hom(P, Q\u2032 ) \u2192 0 follows by [13,\nProposition 2.3], since M is n-strongly Gorenstein projective then Gorenstein projective). Now, by\ninductive hypothesis, the complexes Hom(P, K) and Hom(P, F ) are exact, then so is Hom(P, Q\u2032 )\n(by [14, Theorem 6.3]), as desired.\nTo prove the equivalences 1 \u21d4 3 and 2 \u21d4 4, it suffices to apply the following remark. If there exists\nan exact sequence of the form:\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0,\nwhere each Pi is a projective module, we get Exti (M, G) \u223c\n= Extn+i (M, G) for all i \u2265 1 and all\nmodules G (from [14, Theorem 9.4]). This implies that Exti (M, G) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 whenever n\nsuccessive terms of Ext(M, G) vanish.\nRecall that a ring R is called Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring (or simply a Gorenstein ring), if R is both\nleft and right Noetherian and if R has finite self-injective dimension on both the left and the right\n[8, Definition 9.1.1]. Over Gorenstein rings, n-strongly Gorenstein projective modules have the\nfollowing characterization:\nCorollary 2.9 If R is a Gorenstein ring, then an R-module M is n-strongly Gorenstein projective\nif and only if there exits an exact sequence of the form 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0, where\neach Pi is a projective R-module.\nProof. Simply apply Theorem 2.8 and the fact that over a Gorenstein ring every projective module\nhas finite injective dimension [8, Proposition 9.1.7].\nNow, we give change of rings results.\nTheorem 2.10 Let R \u2192 S be a homomorphism of commutative rings with pdR (S) < \u221e. If M is\nan n-strongly Gorenstein projective R-module (n \u2265 1), then S \u2297R M is an n-strongly Gorenstein\nprojective S-module.\nProof. Let M be an n-strongly Gorenstein projective R-module. Then, there exists, by Theorem\n2.8 and its proof, an exact sequence of R-modules 0 \u2192 M \u2192 Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 0, where each\nPi is projective, and ExtiR (M, Q\u2032 ) = 0 for any i \u2265 1 and for any R-module Q\u2032 with finite projective\ndimension.\nAs the end of the proof of Theorem 2.8, TorR\ni (S, M ) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 whenever n successive terms\nof TorR (S, M ) vanish. This holds since pdR (S) < \u221e, which shows that the following sequence of\nS-modules:\n0 \u2192 S \u2297R M \u2192 S \u2297R Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 S \u2297R P1 \u2192 S \u2297R M \u2192 0\n\n\fA generalization of strongly Gorenstein projective modules\n\n7\n\nis exact. Note that each S \u2297R Pi is a projective S-module.\nOn the other hand, for any S-module N , ExtiS (S \u2297R M, N ) = ExtiR (M, N ) or all i \u2265 1 (by [5,\nProposition 4.1.3]). If the S-module N is projective, then it has finite projective dimension as an\nR-module. Indeed, pdR (S) < \u221e implies that pdR (S (I) ) < \u221e for any index set I, and so does\nN being a direct summand of a free S-module. Then, ExtiS (S \u2297R M, N ) = ExtiR (M, N ) = 0 by\nthe observation above. Therefore, by Theorem 2.8, S \u2297R M is an n-strongly Gorenstein projective\nS-module.\nCorollary 2.11 Let R \u2192 S be a homomorphism of commutative rings with pdR (S) < \u221e. If M is\na Gorenstein projective R-module, then S \u2297R M is a Gorenstein projective S-module.\nProof. Let M be a Gorenstein projective R-module. Then, it is a direct summand of a strongly\nGorenstein projective R-module G (by [3, Theorem 2.7]). Then, S \u2297R M is a direct summand of\nthe S-module S \u2297R G which is, from Theorem 2.10, strongly Gorenstein projective. Therefore, from\n[3, Theorem 2.7], S \u2297R M is a Gorenstein projective S-module, as desired.\nFinally, it is convenient to mention that one could define and study the n-strongly injective and\nflat modules as we have done in the Gorenstein projective case, and so Proposition 2.5, Theorems\n2.8 and 2.10, and Corollaries 2.9 and 2.11 have the Gorenstein injective and flat counterparts.\nAcknowledgements.
