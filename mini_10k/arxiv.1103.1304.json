They are\ncharacterised by millisecond radio bursts with flux densities\nat 1.4 GHz of \u223c 0.1 \u2212 10 Jy. The bursts are infrequent, with\nintervals of as long as a few hours to as short as a few minutes (Keane et al. 2010). The rotation periods, inferred by\ndividing the burst intervals by the largest common denominator, lie in the 0.1 \u2212 7 s range. Of the 22 RRAT sources\nin the PMPS with known periods, 11 have periods greater\nthan 4 s, compared to just \u223c 2% of radio pulsars (Keane\n2010). These long periods are reminiscent of the (X-ray dim)\nisolated neutron stars and the magnetars (see Haberl 2007\nand Mereghetti 2008). Using their dispersion measure, the\nRRATs are found to lie approximately 1\u20137 kpc distant in\nthe Galactic plane (Keane 2010).\n\n?\n\nE-mail: vik.dhillon@sheffield.ac.uk\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nThe nature of RRATs is still an open question. A simple estimate of their Galactic population suggests that they\nmay be more abundant than the radio pulsars. In fact, if\nwe consider RRATs and the other known classes of neutron\nstars as distinct populations, a birthrate problem arises, i.e.\nneutron stars appear to be formed faster than the observed\nsupernova rate. This problem may be resolved, however, if\nthe various neutron star types are instead regarded as different evolutionary phases (Keane & Kramer 2008). Two\nmain models have been proposed for the intermittent pulses\nexhibited by RRATs, with some researchers assigning the\nphenomenon to detection issues and others favouring intrinsically transient emission. Weltevrede et al. (2006) suggest\nthat RRATs are distant analogues of PSR B0656+14, i.e.\npulsars with regular emission that is below our detection\nlimit but which show large amplitude pulses drawn from an\nextended pulse-energy distribution. Alternatively, Cordes &\nShannon (2008) suggest that the bursts in RRATs are powered by the episodic injection of material from a circumpolar asteroid belt, formed from supernova fallback material,\nthat temporarily reactivates a quiescent region of the mag-\n\n\f2\n\nV. S. Dhillon et al.\n\nnetosphere. Similarly, Luo & Melrose (2007) propose that\nRRATs may be surrounded by planetary-like radiation belts,\nand the trapped plasma in this belt is episodically disrupted\n(e.g. by starquakes or stellar oscillations) causing particle\nprecipitation towards the star and hence bursts. Besides\nexternal triggers, it has also been suggested (Zhang et al.\n2007) that RRATs are old pulsars approaching the 'death\nvalley' (Chen & Ruderman 1993), where pulsar emission is\nthought to switch off.\nOf the 56 known RRATs (Keane 2010), J1819\u22121458 is\nthe most prolific, brightest and thus best-studied source.\nJ1819\u22121458 has a rotation period of 4.263 s and shows\n\u223c 3 ms pulses every \u223c 3 min, amounting to \u223c 1 s of\nradio emission per day. From its measured period derivative, J1819\u22121458 has an inferred magnetic field strength of\nB = 5 \u00d7 1013 G, just below that of the magnetars, providing another link between these two classes of neutron stars.\nAs well as in the radio (e.g. Lyne et al. 2009), J1819\u22121458\nhas been observed in X-rays on several occasions (Reynolds\net al. 2006, McLaughlin et al. 2007, Rea et al. 2009). The\nX-ray observations show a thermal spectrum consistent with\nwhat is expected from a cooling neutron star, and the X-ray\nflux exhibits the same rotation period as derived from radio\nobservations. Observations of J1819\u22121458 at wavelengths\nother than radio and X-ray are also highly desirable in order to measure the spectral energy distribution and help\nconstrain the pulsar emission mechanism. Deep infrared observations have revealed very tentative evidence for a counterpart at Ks \u223c 21 magnitude (Rea et al. 2010). There is\nno evidence of an optical counterpart, but this could be due\nto the rather modest magnitude limit of I = 17.5 (Reynolds\net al. 2006).\nTaking longer exposures to go deeper, however, is not\nnecessarily the best solution, as the RRATs may have very\nfaint persistent optical/IR emission and only emit strongly\nat these wavelengths during bursts1 . In this case, the best\nstrategy would be to reduce the contribution of the sky and\ntake a continuous sequence of extremely short exposures on\na large-aperture telescope covering a number of burst cycles\nin order to catch a burst in one or two of the frames. In paper I (Dhillon et al. 2006), we tried such an approach using\nthe high-speed CCD camera ULTRACAM (Dhillon et al.\n2007) on the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). We\nfound no evidence for bursts brighter than i0 = 16.6. This\nlimit may not appear to be particularly deep, but it must\nbe remembered that it refers to the burst magnitude, not\nthe persistent magnitude. In fact, there is only one way in\nwhich it is possible to significantly improve upon the ULTRACAM+WHT burst limit: observing in the optical simultaneously with the radio, which would allow just those\noptical frames coincident with the dispersion-corrected radio bursts to be searched for optical bursts. In this paper we\nreport on such observations, obtained with ULTRACAM on\nthe WHT and the 3.5-m New Technology Telescope (NTT),\nsimultaneously with the 76-m Lovell Telescope at Jodrell\nBank Observatory (JBO).\n\n1 The main optical pulse of the Crab pulsar, for example, is \u223c 5\nmagnitudes brighter than its persistent light level.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nThe observations of J1819\u22121458 were obtained on the nights\nof 2008 August 6 (WHT+ULTRACAM and JBO) and 2010\nJune 14 (NTT+ULTRACAM and JBO). In addition to shot\nnoise from any object flux, every ULTRACAM data frame\nhas noise contributions from the sky and CCD readout noise.\nThe sky noise can be reduced by reducing the exposure time,\nbut the readout noise cannot. Hence it makes sense to expose each data frame for as long as the readout noise is the\ndominant noise source, thereby maximising the chances of\nobserving a burst in a single frame without significantly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. ULTRACAM\nwas hence used in drift mode, which gives the highest frame\nrate (see Dhillon et al. 2007), with one window centred on\nthe X-ray position of the RRAT (Rea et al. 2009) and the\nother on a nearby comparison star, as shown in the top panel\nof Fig. 1. An SDSS i0 filter and the slow readout speed were\nused in the red arm of ULTRACAM on both nights, and the\nfocal-plane mask was used to prevent light from bright stars\nand the sky from contaminating the windows (see Dhillon\net al. 2007). On 2008 August 6, the CCD windows were\nunbinned and of size 60 \u00d7 60 pixels, where each pixel on\nthe WHT is 0.3\". A total of 112 588 frames were obtained\nbetween 21:11\u201322:49 UTC on this night, each of 51.1 ms exposure time and 1.4 ms dead time. The data were obtained\nin photometric conditions, with no Moon and seeing of 0.9\".\nOn 2010 June 14, the CCD windows were binned 2 \u00d7 2 and\nof size 150 \u00d7 150 pixels, where each unbinned pixel on the\nNTT is 0.35\". A total of 68 274 frames were obtained between 01:32\u201302:14 UTC and 02:45\u201303:46 UTC; the gap in\nthe middle of the run was due to a GRB override observation (Dhillon et al. 2010). Each frame had an exposure time\nof 86.5 ms and a dead time of 3.5 ms. Conditions on this\nnight were not as good as in 2008, with seeing of 1.9\" at the\nstart of the run, dropping to 1.2\" at the end. The night was\nphotometric and there was no Moon.\nSimultaneous radio observations at JBO were made at\nan observing frequency of 1.4 GHz using a dual-channel cryogenic receiver sensitive to left- and right-handed circular\npolarisation. In 2008 an analogue filterbank (AFB) backend was used with an observing bandwidth consisting of\n64 \u00d7 1 MHz channels and a time sampling of 100 \u03bcs. Since\n2009, pulsar observations at JBO have upgraded to using a\ndigital filterbank (DFB) backend. Thus the 2010 observations used the DFB with a bandwidth of 1024 \u00d7 0.5 MHz\nchannels, half of which (\u223c 250 MHz) were usable, and a\ntime sampling of 1 ms. In both cases, the polarisations were\nsummed to give total intensity (Stokes I) and the output\nwas either 1-bit digitised (in 2008) or 2-bit digitised (in\n2010). In both radio datasets the zero dispersion-measure\nsubtraction algorithm (Eatough et al. 2009) was used in an\nattempt to remove sources of broadband radio frequency interference, as described by Keane et al. (2010). The 2008\ndataset suffers less from radio frequency interference than\nthe 2010 observations due to the narrower bandwidth of\nthe former. The pulse times of arrival at JBO were then\nobtained by cross-correlating the single-pulse profiles with\na smooth single-component template. In addition to the\nlight travel time from the source to the Earth, radio signals\ntraversing the interstellar medium suffer an extra frequencydependent delay of the form: tDM = 4150 s DM\n, where f is\nf2\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fA search for optical bursts from RRAT J1819\u22121458: II.\nthe observing frequency in MHz, and DM is the dispersion measure (the integrated electron density along the line\nof sight to the source measured by convention in units of\ncm\u22123 pc). At 1.4 GHz, this delay is 415 ms for J1819\u22121458\n(DM = 196.0(4) cm\u22123 pc) with respect to a signal at infinite\nfrequency, and differs by 38 ms (250 ms) between the top\nand bottom of our band for the 2008 (2010) observation. The\noptical signal is not subject to such a delay. Thus the radio\nsignal is de-dispersed to infinite frequency (i.e. this delay is\nremoved according to the known dispersion measure of the\nsource) before comparison is made with the optical times.\n\n3\n\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nThe ULTRACAM frames were first debiased and then flatfielded using images of the twilight sky. The list of JBO\npulse arrival times on each night were corrected for dispersion, converted to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) at\nthe solar system barycentre, and then compared with the\nbarycentred ULTRACAM times. Note that each ULTRACAM frame is time-stamped to a relative (i.e. frame-toframe) accuracy of \u223c 50 \u03bcs and an absolute accuracy of \u223c 1\nms using a dedicated GPS system (see Dhillon et al. 2007). It\nwas found that 24 and 25 dispersion-corrected radio bursts\nhad corresponding optical frames on 2008 August 6 and 2010\nJune 14, respectively, and these ULTRACAM images were\nthen shifted to correct for telescope guiding errors and coadded (see Section 4).\nAperture photometry at the X-ray position of\nJ1819\u22121458 (Rea et al. 2009) was performed using the ULTRACAM pipeline data reduction system. To do this, we\nhad to determine the pixel position of J1819\u22121458 on the\nULTRACAM CCD. This was achieved by transforming the\nx, y pixel coordinates to equatorial coordinates using the\nknown positions of bright stars in the field. We estimate that\nthe uncertainty in the resulting pixel position of J1819\u22121458\nis 0.5\". We extracted a light curve for both the comparison\nstar and the position of the RRAT using variable-sized apertures with diameters set to 3 times the seeing, as measured\nfrom the FWHM of the comparison star, which is \u223c 3 \u2212 6\ntimes larger than the error in the RRAT position on the\nULTRACAM frames. The sky level was determined from an\nannulus surrounding each aperture and subtracted from the\nobject counts.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nRadio observations\nThe radio pulses detected from J1819\u22121458 are known to\narrive preferentially at three distinct rotation phases (Lyne\net al. 2009). The left-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows a grey-scale\nintensity plot of the individual pulses detected during the\n2010 June 14 observation with the Lovell Telescope, as well\nas the combined profile from adding these pulses together.\nThe three 'sub-pulses' are clearly visible. The right-hand\npanel of Fig. 2 shows a histogram of pulse arrival times in\nrotation phase with respect to the long-term radio-derived\nephemeris at JBO (Lyne et al. 2009). This is essentially\na probability distribution in rotation phase for the radio\npulses. The unshaded histogram denotes all pulses detected,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nas part of our regular timing observations (Lyne et al. 2009),\nin the time interval between the optical observations in 2008\nand in 2010. The shaded histogram shows the corresponding\ndistribution for the pulses detecting during the optical observations. The two histograms are similar, implying that the\npulses detected during the simultaneous observations were\ntypical and J1819\u22121458 seems to have been no more nor\nless 'active' in the radio than at other times.\n\nOptical observations\nThe sum of the 24 and 25 ULTRACAM i0 -band frames containing radio bursts on 2008 August 6 and 2010 June 14 are\nshown in the right-hand central and lower panels of Fig. 1.\nFor comparison, the sum of all the ULTRACAM frames obtained on each night are shown in the corresponding lefthand panels.\nThe circles plotted in Fig. 1 indicate the expected position of J1819\u22121458, with the radius equal to the error in\nthis position on our ULTRACAM frames. Inspecting the\nzoomed-in boxes to the right of each panel reveals no visual\nevidence for the RRAT in either burst (right) or persistent\n(left) light. Note the significantly worse quality of the NTT\ndata (bottom panels in Fig. 1) compared to the WHT data\n(central panels) due to the poorer seeing, which forced us to\non-chip bin these data by a factor of 2.\nSo far, we have implicitly assumed that the optical and\nradio bursts are coincident, and that the radio bursts are\nequal or shorter in duration than the putative optical bursts.\nThis is a reasonable assumption given, for example, the behaviour of the Crab pulsar, which shows that the optical\npulse is approximately 5 times wider than the radio pulse\nand leads the radio pulse by only \u223c 200 \u03bcs (Shearer et al.\n2003; Slowikowska et al. 2009). Since we know precisely when\nthe radio bursts occured, it is a simple matter to search for\noptical bursts lagging/leading the radio bursts and/or of\ndifferent widths to the radio bursts by combining the appropriate optical frames. Hence, as well as summing the ULTRACAM frames coincident with the radio bursts, n, we\nalso co-added the frames n \u2212 1, n + 1 and n \u00b1 1. None of the\nresulting images show any evidence of the RRAT.\nThe searches described so far have relied on the ability\nof the eye to identify a star in a summed image. A different\napproach is to inspect the light curve obtained by extracting\nthe counts in an aperture centred on the position of the\nRRAT. Fig. 3 shows the light curves obtained on each night.\nThe signature of an optical counterpart to the radio bursts\nwould be a series of deviant points lying approximately 5\u03c3\nor greater from the mean2 and aligned temporally with the\nradio bursts (indicated by the vertical tick marks near the\ntop of Fig. 3). Given that the exposure time is significantly\nlonger than the radio burst duration, one would expect only\none, or at most two, points per burst.\nThe dashed line in Fig. 3 shows the +5\u03c3 deviation level.\nIt can be seen that there are no points lying above this\nline. Moreover, the optical points coincident with the radio\nbursts, marked by the stars in Fig. 3, appear to be randomly\n\n2\n\nWe have chosen 5\u03c3 as we have \u223c 105 data points and only one\npoint in \u223c 106 would be expected to be greater than 5\u03c3 from the\nmean in a Gaussian distribution.\n\n\f4\n\nV.

Fig. 3 also shows the\npoints lying 4\u03c3 above the mean: none of these are coincident\nwith the radio bursts, none of the images show any obvious\nsign of a star, and the intervals between the 4\u03c3 points are not\nrelated to the rotation period. The implication of the preceding results is that we have not detected any evidence for\noptical counterparts to the radio bursts from J1819\u22121458.\nWe also searched for periodicities in the light curves using a\nLomb-Scargle periodogram (Press & Rybicki 1989). No evidence for a significant peak around the 4.263 s rotation period, or any other period, was found. As stated in Section 2,\nthe dead-time of ULTRACAM during our J1819\u22121458 ob-\n\nservations was always an insignificant fraction of the exposure time and approximately the same duration as the radio\nbursts shown in Fig. 2. This makes it unlikely we missed a\nsingle optical burst whilst ULTRACAM was reading out, let\nalone the expected 24\u201325 bursts.\nIt is useful to place a magnitude limit on the optical\nbursts from J1819\u22121458 in order to constrain the spectral\nenergy distribution. From the summed images of the burst\nframes, we find that the RRAT shows no evidence for optical\nbursts brighter than i0 = 19.3 at the 5\u03c3 level in the deeper\nWHT observations. As expected, the simultaneous opticalradio observations have enabled us to impose a significantly\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fA search for optical bursts from RRAT J1819\u22121458: II.\n\n5\n\n40\nThis Work\nJBO: 2008/08-2010/07\n35\n\nNumber of pulses\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n-0.015\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.005\n\n0\nRotation phase\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\nFigure 2.

Note the difference in the scale of the ordinate.\nThe increased scatter at the start of the run was due to poor seeing. To plot the dashed +5\u03c3 curve in this case, the standard deviation\nwas calculated for groups of 100 points and the result fitted with a polynomial. The gap in the centre of the run was due to a GRB\noverride observation with ULTRACAM.\n\ndeeper limit than the optical-only observations of paper I,\nwhen we derived i0 > 16.6. The corresponding flux density\nlimit is i0 < 70 \u03bcJy, where the flux has been calculated using\nequation 2 of Fukugita et al. (1996) and the effective wavelength of the observation is 7610\u00c5 (see Dhillon et al. 2006).\nWe can now compare this to the burst radio flux density of\n3600 mJy at 1.4 GHz measured by McLaughlin et al. (2006)\nto deduce that the spectral slope must be steeper than approximately f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.9 . Note that the X-ray emission of\nJ1819\u22121458, which exhibits pulsations rather than bursts,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nis 10 nJy at 0.3-5 keV (Rea et al. 2009), and also lies very\nclose to the line f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.9 . For comparison, the radio-tooptical slope of the pulsed radiation from the Crab has a\nmuch shallower slope of \u223c \u22120.2 (measured from Fig. 9.3 of\nLyne & Graham-Smith 2005).\nFor completeness, we have also calculated the i0 magnitude limit of J1819\u22121458 from the sum of all of the WHT\nobservations. We derive a magnitude limit of i0 > 21.9 at 5\u03c3\nconfidence, significantly deeper than the limit on the persistent light of I = 17.5 derived by Reynolds et al. (2006). Of\n\n\f6\n\nV. S. Dhillon et al.\n\ncourse, our limit could have been substantially deeper had\nwe decided not to look for bursts and instead taken just a\nfew long exposures.\n\nBased on observations collected at ESO, Chile (Programme\n085.D-0429) and the ING, La Palma.\n\nREFERENCES\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn paper I, we used aperture photometry centred on the Xray position of J1819\u22121458 to search for the RRAT. With\nno way of knowing in which frames the bursts occurred, this\nsearch strategy was relatively insensitive, as we were relying on detecting individual optical bursts above the noise.\nIn this paper, we present a far more sensitive technique: simultaneous radio observations of the RRAT bursts to tag\nthe corresponding optical frames. These tagged frames were\nthen co-added to produce a summed 'burst' frame. Unfortunately, even though the resulting summed frame allowed us\nto probe nearly 3 magnitudes deeper than before, we find no\nevidence for the RRAT to a 5\u03c3 limit of i0 = 19.3. This limit\nallows us to say that the slope of the pulsed radio-optical\nspectrum must be steeper than \u22120.9 and that extrapolating this slope correctly predicts the X-ray flux. A more detailed comparison with RRAT emission models is unjustified\nwithout unambiguously determined fluxes in the optical and\ninfrared.\nIn comparison to our other detections of pulsars with\nULTRACAM, e.g. i0 = 25.3 for AXP 1E 1048.1\u20135937\n(Dhillon et al. 2009), our limit on J1819\u22121458 does not appear to be particularly deep. To place it in some context,\ntherefore, it should be noted that if we had taken a single\n1 hour exposure of the field with the WHT under identical conditions, and assuming the object emitted 24 bursts,\neach of i0 = 19.3 and 51.1 ms duration, we would have have\nobtained a signal-to-noise ratio of only \u223c 0.02\u03c3. Using the\nhigh-speed photometry technique described in this paper, on\nthe other hand, we would have detected the source at 5\u03c3.\nThe difference in sensitivity between the two techniques is\ndue to the fact that the long exposure would be sky limited,\nwhereas the data presented in this paper are readout-noise\nlimited, and the former noise source is over twenty times\nlarger than the latter. The only way we can now significantly\nimprove upon our magnitude limit with ULTRACAM is to\nobserve simultaneously for a longer period of time (in order\nto detect and co-add more bursts) and/or use larger optical and radio telescopes (in order to increase the number of\ncounts detected from each burst in the optical and to detect\nmore bursts in the radio). The discussion above assumes, of\ncourse, that the optical and radio light behave in a similar manner. If, however, the optical light has only a low (or\nno) pulsed fraction, then deep, long-exposure imaging might\nprove fruitful, as might deeper searches for pulsed light on\nthe proposed rotation period of the neutron star, e.g. Dhillon\net al. (2009).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nULTRACAM, VSD, TRM, CMC, SPL and PK are supported by the STFC. SPL also acknowledges the support\nof an RCUK Fellowship.
