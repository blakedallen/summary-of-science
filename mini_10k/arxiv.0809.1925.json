Introduction\nThere has been an enormous progress in the determination of the quark\nmasses in the recent years due to improved experimental results, many highorder calculations in perturbative QCD and precise lattice simulations.1 In\nthis contribution we describe two recent analyses which lead to the most\nprecise results for the MS charm quark mass.\nThe first method2\u20134 is based on four-loop perturbative calculations for\nthe moments of the vector correlator which are combined with moments extracted from precise experimental input for the total hadronic cross section\nin electron positron collisions.\nAlso the second method5 relies on four-loop calculations, however, for\nthe pseudo-scalar rather than for the vector current correlator. It is combined with data obtained from simulations on the lattice with dynamical\ncharm quarks. The latter are tuned such that the mass splitting between\nthe \u03a5\u2032 and \u03a5 and the meson masses m2\u03c0 , 2m2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 , m\u03b7c and m\u03a5 are correctly reproduced. Thus the underlying experimental data are completely\ndifferent from the first approach.\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018\n\n7:39\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\ncaqcd\n\n2\n\n2. R(s) and perturbative QCD\nThe basic object for the first method is the total hadronic cross section in\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation. Normalized to the production cross section of a muon\npair it defines the quantity\nR(s) =\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons)\n,\n\u03c3pt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3pt = 4\u03c0\u03b12 /(3s).\nA compilation of the experimental data contributing to R(s) in the\ncharm region can be found in Fig. 1. For our analysis it is of particular\nimportance to have precise values for the electronic widths of the narrow\nresonances J/\u03a8 and \u03a8\u2032 which have been measured by various experiments.1\nFurthermore, we rely on the excellent data provided by the BES collaboration6,7 in the region between 3.73 GeV (which is the onset of D meson\nproduction) and about 5 GeV which marks the end point of the strong\nvariations of R(s). Above 5 GeV R(s) is basically flat and can be described\nvery well within perturbative QCD taking into account charm quark effects.\nThus in this region we use rhad,8 a fortran program containing all stateof-the-art radiative corrections to R(s) since between 5 GeV and 7 GeV no\nreliable data is available.\nSince we are interested in the extraction of the charm quark mass we\nhave to consider the part of R(s) which corresponds to the production\nof charm quarks, usually denoted by Rc (s). Rc (s) is used to compute the\nso-called experimental moments through\nZ\nds\nexp\nRc (s) .\n(2)\nMn \u2261\nsn+1\nIt is clear that in order to perform the integration in Eq. (2) one has to\nsubtract the contributions from the three light quarks. This has to be done\nin a careful manner which is described in detail in Ref.4\nThe theoretical counterpart to Eq. (2) is given by\n\u0013n\n\u0012\n1\nC\u0304n .\n(3)\nMth\n=\nn\n4m2c\nwhere the C\u0304n are obtained from the Taylor coefficients of the photon polarization function for small external momentum.\nLow moments are perturbative and have long been known through threeloop order 11\u201313 (see Ref.14,15 for moments up to n = 30). More recently also\nthe four-loop contribution for n = 116,17 and n = 2 could be evaluated18\n(see also Ref.19 ).\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018\n\n7:39\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\ncaqcd\n\nR(s)\n\n3\n\n5\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\npQCD\n2\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\n3\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u25b2\n\u274d\n\u25bc\n\u25a0\n\n,\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u221a\n\uf8e5s (GeV)\n\n6\n\n7\n\nBES (2001)\nMD-1\nCLEO\nBES (2006)\n8\n\n9 10\n\nFig. 1.

The uncertainties, which are indicated by the dashed curves, are\nobtained from the variation of the input parameters and of \u03bc. The inner and outer error\nbars give the statistical and systematical uncertainty, respectively. Next to the data from\nBES6,7 we also show the results form MD-19 and CLEO.10 The narrow resonances are\nindicated by dashed lines.\n\nIn the perturbative calculation we renormalize the charm quark mass\nin the MS scheme. This enables us to extract directly the corresponding\nshort-distance quantity avoiding the detour to the pole mass and the corresponding intrinsic uncertainty.\nThe results obtained for the charm quark mass from equating the experimental and theoretical moments are collected in Tab. 1. In order to obtain\nthese numbers we set the renormalization scale to \u03bc = 3 GeV and extract\nas a consequence mc (3 GeV). The uncertainties are due to the experimental\nmoments, \u03b4\u03b1s (MZ ) = \u00b10.002, the variation of \u03bc between 2 GeV and 4 GeV\nand the non-perturbative gluon condensate.\nIn contrast to the corresponding table in Ref.4 we included in Tab. 1\nthe new four-loop results from Ref.18 for n = 2. This leads to a shift in the\ncentral value from 0.979 GeV to 0.976 GeV. Furthermore the uncertainty\nof 6 MeV which was due to the absence of the four-loop result is removed.\nThe results in Tab. 1 show an impressive consistency when going from\nn = 1 to n = 4 although the relative weight form the various energy regions\ncontributing to Mexp is completely different: whereas for n = 1 the region\n\u221a\nfor s \u2265 5 GeV amounts to about 50% of the resonance contribution it is\nless than 4% for n = 3.

Lattice gauge theory and perturbative QCD\nIn the recent years there has been a tremendous progress in developing\nprecise QCD simulations on the lattice. In particular, it has been possible\nto simulate relativistic charm quarks using the so-called Highly Improved\nStaggered Quark (HISQ) discretization of the quark action.20,21 In Ref.5\nthis has been used to evaluate moments of the pseudo-scalar correlator\nwith an uncertainty below 1%. The moments from the lattice calculation\nare equated with the ones computed within perturbative QCD. In Ref.19\nthe second non-trivial moment could be evaluated with the help the axial\nWard identity from the first moment of the longitudinal part of the axialvector current. Very recently this trick could be extended in order to arrive\nat the third moment for the pseudo-scalar current.22\nTab. 2 summarizes the results obtained for mc (3 GeV) (for n = 2 and 3)a\ntogether with the corresponding uncertainties from the lattice, \u03b1s , missing\nhigher order perturbative corrections and the gluon condensate.b\nLike in the previous section we find also here an excellent agreement in\nthe central values which leads us to the final result\nmc (3 GeV) = 0.986(10) GeV .\n\n(5)\n\nLet us mention that the dimensionless first moment can be used to\nextract a value for the strong coupling. We can furthermore consider ratios\nof moments in order to get rid of the overall dependence on mc and again\nextract \u03b1s . In Ref.5 this has been done for the ratio of the second to the\nthird moment which is known to four-loop order within perturbative QCD.\nThe two determinations lead to\n\u03b1(4)\ns (3 GeV) = 0.251(6) ,\n\n(6)\n\na Note that for n = 1 no charm quark mass can be determined since, in contrast to the\nvector correlator, the corresponding moment is dimensionless.\nb For the presentation in this Section the notation of Ref.5 for the numeration of the\nmoments has been translated to the one of Ref.4\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018\n\n7:39\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\ncaqcd\n\n6\n\nwhich corresponds toc\n\u03b1(5)\ns (MZ ) = 0.1174(12) .\n\n(7)\n\nThis value agree well with the particle data group result1 and other recent\ndeterminations (see, e.g., Refs.24,25 ).\n4. Summary\nIn this contribution we have presented the two to date most precise determinations of the charm quark mass. Let us stress once again that, although in both cases moments of current correlators are considered, the two\nmethods rely on completely different experimental input and on different\ntheory calculations. Whereas in one case perturbative QCD is compared\nwith experimental data for R(s), in the second case high precision lattice\nsimulations with dynamical charm quarks are crucial ingredients. It is quite\nimpressive that the final results as given in Eqs. (4) and (5) coincide both\nin the central value and the uncertainty.\nIn Fig. 3 we compare the results of Section 2 and Section 3 with various\nother recent determinations. One observes a good agreement, however, our\nresults are by far the most precise ones, as can be seen by the grey band.\nUp to this point we have presented results for the MS charm quark\nmass evaluated at the scale \u03bc = 3 GeV. In general, the comparison of\nresults from various analyses are performed for the scale-invariant mass,\nmc (mc ) (see, e.g., Ref.1 ). Note, however, that the scale \u03bc = mc is quite\nlow and the numerical value of \u03b1s is relatively big. Thus, it would be more\nappropriate to perform the comparison at a higher scale like \u03bc = 3 GeV.\nLet us nevertheless present the scale-invariant charm quark mass. From\n0.986(10) GeV one obtains\nmc (mc ) = 1.268(9) GeV .\n\n(8)\n\nThe method described in Section 2 can also be used to extract the\nbottom quark mass. The analysis of Ref.4 leads to\nmb (mb ) = 4.164(25) GeV .\nAfter including the new four-loop results from Ref.\nbecomes\nmb (mb ) = 4.162(19) GeV ,\n\n(9)\n18\n\nthe result of Eq. (9)\n(10)\n\nwhich has a significantly reduced uncertainty.\nc The\n\ncalculation of the running and decoupling is easily done with the help of RunDec.23\n\n\fNovember 23, 2018\n\n7:39\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\ncaqcd\n\n7\n\nHPQCD + Karlsruhe 08\nlattice + pQCD\n\nKuehn, Steinhauser, Sturm 07\nlow-moment sum rules, NNNLO\n\nBuchmueller, Flaecher 05\nB decays \u03b1s2\u03b20\n\nHoang, Manohar 05\nB decays \u03b1s2\u03b20\n\nHoang, Jamin 04\nNNLO moments\n\ndeDivitiis et al. 03\nlattice quenched\n\nRolf, Sint 02\n\nlattice (ALPHA) quenched\n\nBecirevic, Lubicz, Martinelli 02\nlattice quenched\n\nKuehn, Steinhauser 01\n\nlow-moment sum rules, NNLO\n\nQWG 2004\nPDG 2006\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\nmc(3 GeV) (GeV)\nFig. 3.\n\nComparison of recent determinations of mc (3 GeV).\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Konstantin Chetyrkin, Hans K\u00fchn, Peter Lepage,\nChristian Sturm and the HPQCD lattice group for a fruitful and pleasant\ncollaboration.
