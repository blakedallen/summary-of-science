In this way, we can implement pure quantum\ncommunication in directly sending classical information, Ekert's quantum cryptography and\nquantum teleportation without the help of classical communications channel.\n\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a\n\nIndistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states is at the heart of quantum\ncomputation and quantum information[1]. Although it is possible for distinguishing\nnon-orthogonal quantum states some of the time[1-3], the proof[1] and no-cloning\ntheorem[4] that we cannot exactly clone an unknown quantum state prohibit distinguishing\nnon-orthogonal quantum states with perfect reliability.\nSo far, all quantum communications that can be implemented have to be helped with\nclassical communications channel[1] (CCC) in which information can be sent by\nelectromagnetic wave or broadcast, or sending quantum system (or qubit). For examples,\nsuppose Alice communicates with Bob, quantum cryptography or quantum key\ndistribution[5-9] includes CCC used in communicating the information of choice of\nmeasurement bases between Alice and Bob, and used in sending qubit. Quantum\nteleportation[10-13] includes CCC in which Alice must transmit her measurement result to\nBob. Dense coding[14-16] includes CCC in which Alice sends qubit to Bob.\nIf a quantum communication can be implemented without the help of CCC, we call it\npure quantum communication (PQC). It is indistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum\nstates that prevents PQC in Ekert's quantum cryptography[9] and the quantum\nteleportation[10-13] that need sending information but need no sending qubit. Sending qubit\nmust be in CCC, therefore it prevents PQC in the quantum cryptography[5-8] and the Dense\ncoding[14-16].\nIn this letter, I design a simple way of distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with\nperfect reliability using only quantum CNOT gates in one condition. In ref. 17, I have designed\n\n\fa way of doing same things using single qubit gates and quantum CNOT gates in the condition.\nSo we can surpass the confine of the proof and no-cloning theorem and make use of the ways\nin PQC in directly sending classical information, Ekert's quantum cryptography[9] and the\nquantum teleportation[10-13] without the help of CCC.\nSuppose Alice and Bob are separated in space. They share an EPR[18] pair |\u03c8>=\n(|00>+|11>)\u2215 2 . Alice wants to send a bit classical information to Bob, she can measure\nher qubit by selecting one of the two bases: {|0>, |1>}, or {(|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2 }. If Alice\nmeasures her qubit by selecting the first base, then Bob's qubit will be in state|0> or |1>\ninstantaneously [1]. If Alice selects the other base, then Bob's qubit will be in state (|0>+|1>)\n\u2215 2 or (|0>-|1>)\u2215 2 instantaneously. For getting a bit classical information from Alice,\nBob must distinguish the two set states {|0>, |1>} and {(|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2 }.\nIn the case of distinguishing two arbitrary non-orthogonal states, we should be given one\ncondition that we know one of the two arbitrary non-orthogonal states being in eigenstate and\nthe direction of the eigenvector. In communications, Bob knows the directions of two\neigenvectors, and he can do projective measurements on his qubit on one direction of an\neigenvector.\nHere is the step. After Alice measures her qubit, Bob's qubit is in one of the four states\ninstantaneously, Bob's task is to distinguish the two set states. Bob lets his qubit to control\nqubit line and an ancilla qubit to target qubit line of a quantum\n\nCONT\n\ngate (Fig. 1a). After\n\noperation of a gate, he does projective measurement on the output of target qubit on one\ndirection of an eigenvector, then Bob lets the output of control qubit to control qubit line of\nsecond one, then does same thing again.\nNext is the detail of the step. Fig.1b shows the quantum circuit. Bob selects each ancilla\nqubit (target qubit) being in the state (|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5 (or a|0>+b|1>) . If Bob's qubit is\ninitially in state |0>, he measures each target qubit passed through each gate in state |0> with\nprobability 1/5. After 5 measurements, Bob gets one target qubit in state |0>. If Bob's qubit is\ninitially in state |1>, then each target qubit passed through each gate will be in state\n(2|0>+|1>)\u2215 5 or in state |0> with probability 4/5. After 5 measurements, Bob gets 4\n\n\ftarget qubits in state |0>. So if Alice selects the base {|0>, |1>}, then Bob will get the\nnumber of target qubits in state |0> tending to 1 or 4.\nIf Bob's qubit is initially in one of the two states (|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2 , then the two output\nqubits will be in one of the two entangled states:\n{|0> (|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5 \u00b1|1> (|1>+2|0>)\u2215 5 }\u2215 2 =\n{ [(|0>\u00b12|1>)\u2215 5 ]|0>+ [(2|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 5 ]|1>}\u2215 2 .\n\n(1)\n\nBob measures the target qubit passed through the first gate in state |0> with probability 1/2.\na\nControl qubit line\nTarget qubit line\nQuantum CNOT gate\n\nBob's qubit is initially in one\n\nQuantum circuit symbol for measurement\n\nb\n\nof the four states: |0>, |1>,\n(|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2\n(|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5\n\n(|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5\n(|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5\n\n......\n\nFIG. 1. Quantum CNOT gate and quantum circuit symbol for measurement (a) and quantum\nmeasurement circuit for Bob's qubit (b).\n\nIf Bob gets the first target qubit in state |0>, then the state of control qubit becomes one of\nthe two states (|0>\u00b12|1>)\u2215 5 from Eq.(1); otherwise becomes one of the two states\n\n\f(2|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 5 . Bob lets the qubit in one of the four states (|0>\u00b12|1>)\u2215 5 and\n(2|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 5 and the second ancilla qubit in state (|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5 to the control\nqubit line and target qubit line of the second gate respectively. In the case of (|0>\u00b12|1>)\u2215\n5 , the two output qubits will be in one of the two entangled states:\n{|0> (|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5 \u00b12|1> (|1>+2|0>)\u2215 5 }\u2215 5 =\n{ [(|0>\u00b14|1>)\u2215 17 ] 17 |0>+ [(|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2 ]2 2 |1>}\u22155.\n\n(2)\n\nBob measures the target qubit passed through the second gate in state |0> with probability\n17/25. In the case of (2|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 5 , the two output qubits will be in one of the two\nentangled states:\n{2|0> (|0>+2|1>)\u2215 5 \u00b1|1> (|1>+2|0>)\u2215 5 }\u2215 5 =\n{ [(|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 2 ]2 2 |0>+[(4|0>\u00b1|1>)\u2215 17 ] 17 |1>}\u22155.\n\n(3)\n\nBob measures the target qubit passed through the second gate in state |0> with probability\n8/25. This method that only tests ancilla qubit has been used in quantum error-correction[1].\nIntuition and calculations tell us that after 5 measurements, Bob gets that the number of target\nqubits in state |0> will not tend to 1 or 4, but in the case that Bob's qubit is initially in one of\nthe two states |0> and |1>, he will get the number of target qubits in state |0> tending to 1 or\n4.\nAlthough in this way, Bob still cannot distinguish the two set states with perfect reliability,\nAlice and Bob can use a group of EPR pairs to send a bit classical information, that is, Alice\nselects same base on the group of EPR pairs. So, Bob can get a group of numbers\ncorresponding to the base Alice selected or one set states. Bob can do statistics on these\nnumbers (or second level statistics) and get result that the statistical distribution of these\nnumbers is discrete corresponding to the set states {(|0>\u00b1 |1>)\u2215 2 }, or has two\nconvergent values 1 and 4 corresponding to the set states {|0>, |1>}. Finally, he can make\nuse of the difference to distinguish the two set states with perfect reliability and get a bit\nclassical information.\nQuantum communication can send both classical and quantum information. By use of\n\n\fthis way, we can implement pure quantum communication in directly sending classical\ninformation, Ekert's quantum cryptography[9] and the quantum teleportation[10-13] without\nthe help of classical communications channel.\nBell's inequality[19] continues to be examined[20]. If Bell's inequality can be proved\nand we can get long time EPR pairs against decoherence in future, pure quantum\ncommunication implies that sending information can be fast than light! We believe that this\nwill excite much studies on many relative issues.\nIn summary, I design a simple way of distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with\nperfect reliability using only quantum CNOT gates in the condition. We emphasize that the key\nof distinguishing the two set states is the difference of discrete and two convergent values of\nthe statistical distribution. We expect that the conditional quantum distinguishability will be\nproved in experiments and those pure quantum communications can be implemented.\nI thank B. Shao, J. Zou and J. F.
