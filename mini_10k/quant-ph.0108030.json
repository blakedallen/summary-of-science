In systems\nin which the spatial reflection invariance is broken by the\npresence of a group velocity term, local perturbations of\nthe steady state can be advected more rapidly than their\ngrowth rate. If the system is deterministic then at any\nfixed point any initial localized perturbation decays and\nthe system approaches the undisturbed steady state. In\nthis case macroscopic patterns can arise and be observed\nonly if noise is continuously applied, the structure now\nbeing regenerated at any time, hence the name noisesustained patterns. These structures are the result of\nnoise self-organization, with magnification factors of several order of magnitudes. They are thus interesting candidates for the study of quantum correlations in spatially\nstructured systems.\nAny system with an advection (or drift or walk-off)\nterm that is also not translationally invariant will, in\ngeneral, be convectively unstable when operating sufficiently close to and above the onset of the instability of\nthe steady state. Hence, this type of instability has been\npredicted in a number of optical systems including Kerr\nmedia with a tilted pump [9,12] and optical parametric\noscillators (OPO) with walk-off [12\u201314].\nModeling quantum effects in the regime of convective\ninstability for a nonlinear optical device presents a double\nchallenge. First, the system has a broad spectrum both\nin frequency (at a fixed point) and in wave-vectors (far\nfield at a fixed time), thus it cannot be studied within\na few-mode approximation. Second, we should be able\nto follow the evolution of the fluctuations from the microscopic level through the amplification into the macroscopic pattern. In order to do this we introduce, in Sect.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nNonlinear optics has provided an ideal testing ground\nfor ideas in both nonlinear dynamics and quantum optics. It provides fast nonlinearities and a degree of control that allow fundamental dynamical systems to be realized and nonlinear phenomena like pattern formation\nto be demonstrated [1]. It also provides systems with\nvery low levels of noise so that fluctuations can be limited by quantum effects. The combination of these features has led to the study of quantum phenomena in optical pattern formation [2,3] and of noisy precursors of\nthe patterns, which have been termed quantum images\n[4\u20136]. The accurate modeling of such quantum nonlinear\nsystems presents a significant challenge. Pattern formation and dynamics is usually associated with excitation\nof a large number of transverse modes and a fully quantum description of each of these is required in order to\nproperly treat the quantum fluctuations. The Heisenberg picture produces a hierarchy of coupled nonlinear\noperator equations that usually defies analysis. The preferred method to date has been to linearize the quantum\nfluctuations about a classical field amplitude that usually\ntakes a constant value below threshold [6,7], but may be\nassociated with a stable pattern above threshold [8].\nA more difficult situation arises if the system displays\nmacroscopic features driven by noise. In such cases we\ncannot expect linearization of the quantum fluctuations\nto give reliable results and a new approach is needed. A\nsimple device demonstrating macroscopic, noise-driven\npatterns is the degenerate optical parametric oscillator\nin the presence of walk-off. The semi-classical analysis\nof this device reveals a region of convective instability,\nabove the threshold for oscillation, in which noise sustained structures are seen in the transverse field distribution [9,10]. The aim of this paper is to develop a suit1\n\n\fIV, a suitable non-linear approximation with which to\ntreat the convective regime of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator. In order to fix the terms of reference for\nthis approximation we begin, in Sect. II, with a review of\nthe semi-classical features of the device and its convective\ninstability. This is followed, in Sect. III, by a quantum\ndescription of the device. Once we have introduced our\nmethod we discuss quantum features of the device in its\nvarious regimes of operation (Sect. V), paying particular\nattention to the demanding convective regime (Sect. VI).\n\nHere \u03bei (i = 0, 1) are additive Gaussian white sources of\nnoise, with non-vanishing correlations of the form:\n< \u03bei (~x, t)\u03bej\u2217 (~x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) >= \u03b4ij \u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe level of noise introduced is fixed by the parameters\n\u01eb0 and \u01eb1 . Our fully quantum analysis will produce equations of similar form in which these parameters are fixed.\nE0 is the amplitude of the driving field which we take\nto be real. The remaining parameters in these equations\nare the cavity decay rates \u03b3i , the cavity detunings \u2206i , the\ndiffraction ai , the walk-off v and the nonlinear coefficient\ng. It is convenient to introduce scaled variables\n\nII. SEMI-CLASSICAL DESCRIPTION AND\nCONVECTIVE REGIME\n\nv\n~x\n(4)\n~x\u2032 = \u221a , v \u2032 = \u221a ,\na\na\ng\ng\ng\nA\u2032i = Ai ,\n\u01eb\u2032i = 3/2 D/4 \u01ebi ,\nE0\u2032 = 2 E0 ,\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3 a\n\nt\u2032 = \u03b3t ,\n\nWe consider a Degenerate Optical Parametric Oscillator (DOPO), a device consisting of a cavity filled with\na \u03c7(2) nonlinear medium, which converts a pump at frequency 2\u03c9 into a sub-harmonic signal at frequency \u03c9.\nThe possibility of phase matching the down-conversion\nprocess depends on the birefringence of the crystal that\nprovides a difference of refractive index for differently polarized fields. We can exploit this difference in order to\navoid the effects of dispersion by selecting the same index of refraction for the pump and signal n2\u03c9 = n\u03c9 . In\nthis paper we consider type-I phase matching for which\nordinary polarized pump photons are down-converted to\nproduce pairs of extraordinary polarized photons that are\ndegenerate both in frequency and in polarization.\nIn anisotropic media rays do not necessarily travel in\na direction perpendicular to their wavefronts [15]. As a\nconsequence the extraordinary-polarized signal generated\nin our DOPO will walk off, that is it will propagate in the\ntransverse direction relative to the ordinarily-polarized\npump. This transverse walk-off effect is described in the\ndynamical equations by a term which accounts for a velocity relative to the frame of reference fixed by a pump\nof finite transverse width.\nThe quantum effects we wish to study are associated\nwith the convective regime and it is important to define\nthis carefully. The different regimes of operation of a\nDOPO can be understood within a semiclassical theory\nand this section provides a brief (semi-classical) analysis\nof the convective and other regimes. A more complete\ndiscussion can be found in [13]. The intra-cavity field\nis described by two slowly varying complex field amplitudes A0 (~x, t) and A1 (~x, t) for the pump and signal respectively. These depend on the transverse spatial coordinates ~x = (x, y) and the time t. Within the paraxial\napproximation (for propagation in the z direction), the\nmean field limit and for single longitudinal mode operation the dynamical equations become [13,16,17]:\ng\n\u2202t A0 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b30 [1 + i\u22060 \u2212 ia0 \u22072 ]A0 (~x, t) \u2212 A21 (~x, t)\n2\n+E0 (~x) + \u01eb0 \u03be0 (~x, t),\n(1)\n2\n\u2202t A1 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b31 [1 + i\u22061 \u2212 ia1 \u2207 \u2212 v\u2202y ]A1 (~x, t)\n+gA0 (~x, t)A\u22171 (~x, t) + \u01eb1 \u03be1 (~x, t).\n(2)\n\nwhere we have restricted the cavity decay rates and\ndiffraction coefficients such that \u03b3 = \u03b30 = \u03b31 and\na = a0 = a1 /2. Our equations are valid either for one or\ntwo transverse spatial dimensions (D = 1, 2). On omitting the primes, our amplitude Eqs. (1) and (2) become\n1\n\u2202t A0 (~x, t) = \u2212[1 + i\u22060 \u2212 i\u22072 ]A0 (~x, t) \u2212 A21 (~x, t)\n2\n+E0 (~x) + \u01eb0 \u03be0 (~x, t),\n(5)\n2\n\u2202t A1 (~x, t) = \u2212[1 + i\u22061 \u2212 2i\u2207 \u2212 v\u2202y ]A1 (~x, t)\n+A0 (~x, t)A\u22171 (~x, t) + \u01eb1 \u03be1 (~x, t).\n(6)\nFor a uniform driving field E0 , the equations (5) and (6)\nadmit the homogeneous stationary solution\nAs0 =\n\nE0\n,\n1 + i\u22060\n\nAs1 = 0 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe threshold for parametric oscillation can be determined by a linear stability analysis of this solution. The\nlinearized equations for signal and pump fluctuations\n\u03b4Ai (~x, t) = Ai (~x, t) \u2212 Asi (i = 0, 1) are decoupled, and\nthe fluctuations of the pump are always damped. For the\n~\n~\nsignal, we consider perturbations of the form eik*~x+\u03bb(k)t\nand find the dispersion relation\nq\n\u03bb\u00b1 (~k) = \u22121 + ivky \u00b1 F 2 \u2212 (\u22061 + 2|~k|2 )2 ,\n(8)\nwhere we have introduced a scaled pump\nE0\nF = p\n.\n1 + \u220620\n\n(9)\n\nWe find that there is an instability at F = 1. For\nF < 1, Re(\u03bb) < 0 and the solution (7) is absolutely\nstable. For F > 1, there is a positive growth rate of\nfluctuationsp\n(Re(\u03bb+ ) > 0) which takes a maximum value\n\u2212\u22061 /2 if the signal detuning is negative\nfor |~kc | =\n2\n\n\f(\u22061 < 0), and for k = 0 if \u22061 > 0. In this paper we\nare interested in the case of pattern formation and we\nrestrict our analysis to the case \u22061 < 0. The instability\nat F = 1 when v = 0 is a Turing instability, in which a\nstationary pattern appears [16]. If v 6= 0 then the eigenvalue becomes complex and we find a Hopf bifurcation in\nwhich a traveling pattern emerges [13].\nThe direction of instability is determined by the eigenfunctions V\u00b1 (~k, \u2212~k) of the linear problem \u2202t V\u00b1 (~k, \u2212~k) =\n\u03bb\u00b1 (~k)V\u00b1 (~k, \u2212~k). Solving this gives\n\nof the calculation of the absolute instability threshold as\nfunction of the signal detuning \u22061 , for different values of\nthe walk-off parameter v.\nWalk-off has three main effects in this process of pattern formation [12,13]. The first is the existence of the\nconvective regime in which patterns are sustained by\nnoise. Second is that it breaks the rotational symmetry, favoring the formation of stripes orthogonal to the\nwalk-off direction and traveling in this direction. Thirdly\nthe selected wave-vector, that is the most intense mode\n~kM of the pattern, depends on the walk-off parameter.\nAn approximate expression for ~kM can be obtained in\nthe context of front propagation into an unstable state\n[10,18].\nThere are two important characteristics of the noise\nsustained patterns that exist in the convective regime.\nThe first is a broad spectrum, both in frequency and in\nwave-vectors [19]. Second is the presence of macroscopic\namplified signal fluctuations around the unstable reference state (7). These characteristics imply that the\nconvective regime cannot be studied within a few-mode\napproximation, because many modes contribute significantly to the spectral properties. The presence of macroscopic fluctuations also invalidates approximations based\non linearization schemes. These facts make a quantum\nformulation of the convective regime especially difficult.\nWe face a situation in which nonlinearities determine the\ndynamics of fluctuations around the reference state, with\nfundamental quantum noise being amplified by several\norders of magnitude to produce a macroscopic pattern in\nthe signal.\n\n(10)\nV\u00b1 (~k, \u2212~k) = ei\u03a6\u00b1 \u03b4A1 (~k) \u00b1 \u03b4A\u22171 (\u2212~k)\nq\ni\u22061 + 2i|~k|2 \u2213 |As0 |2 \u2212 (\u22061 + 2|~k|2 )2\n~\n.\nei\u03a6\u00b1 (k) = \u2213\nAs0\nThe solution V+ (~k, \u2212~k) gives the direction of amplification of fluctuations, while fluctuations are damped for\nV\u2212 (~k, \u2212~k). In particular, for the critical wave-vector\n|~kc | and for a real pump E0 and \u22060 = 0, we obtain\nV\u00b1 (~kc , \u2212~kc ) = \u03b4A1 (~kc ) \u00b1 \u03b4A\u22171 (\u2212~kc ). Therefore, in this\ncase, the difference of real parts and the sum of imaginary parts of field in ~kc and \u2212~kc will show damped fluctuations at threshold. We also note that the instability\ndirection is independent of the walk-off term.\n\nIII. QUANTUM FORMULATION\n\nIn the quantum formulation of the DOPO the intracavity pump and signal fields are given by operators \u00c20 (~x, t)\nand \u00c21 (~x, t) that satisfy standard equal-time commutation relations [6]\nh\ni\n\u00c2i (~x, t), \u00c2\u2020j (~x\u2032 , t) = \u03b4ij \u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 ) ,\n(11)\n\nFIG. 1. Stability diagram as a function of the signal detuning \u22061 . The different lines correspond to the threshold\nof absolute instability (Fc ) for different values of the walk-off\nparameter: v = 0.2 (dotted line), v = 0.42 (continuous line),\nv = 0.6 (dashed line). When F < 1 the solution (7) is absolutely stable, while for 1 < F < Fc the solution is convectively\nunstable.\n\nwhere the indices i, j stand for 0, 1. Following the techniques described in [6], we can introduce a model Hamiltonian for the device. This will include the effects of\ndiffraction together with the driving by a real, classical external field, nonlinear interaction between the fields\nand cavity damping. Our model, however, also requires\nthat we take account of the effects of walk-off. The resulting Hamiltonian gives, on making the usual Markov\napproximation, the coupled Heisenberg equations:\n\nAbove the instability threshold (F=1) the steady state\n(7) is convectively unstable: any perturbation grows\nwhile travelling in the direction fixed by the walk-off term\nand eventually leaves the system [13]. In this regime a\ncontinuous perturbation such as a source of noise, gives\nrise to a noise-sustained pattern consisting in disordered\ntravelling stripes in the signal. On increasing the pump\na second threshold is reached at F = Fc . Beyond this\nthreshold the pattern is sustained by the nonlinear dynamics, being also present in the absence of perturbations, once it is formed. The state (7) is absolutely unstable in this regime [13]. In Fig. 1 we plot the result\n\n\u2202t \u00c20 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b30 [(1 + i\u22060 ) \u2212 ia0 \u22072 ]\u00c20 (~x, t)\ng\n\u2212 \u00c221 (~x, t) + E0 (~x) + F\u03020\n(12)\n2\n\u2202t \u00c21 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b31 [(1 + i\u22061 ) \u2212 ia1 \u22072 \u2212 v\u2202y ]\u00c21 (~x, t)\n+g \u00c20 (~x, t)\u00c2\u20201 (~x, t) + F\u03021\n\n3\n\n(13)\n\n\fNote that these are very similar in form to the semiclassical Eqs. (5) and (6). The Langevin operators F\u0302i\ndescribe the quantum noise added as a consequence of\nthe interaction with the bath of external modes.

A standard alternative approach to this Heisenberg\npicture is to consider the evolution equation of the reduced density operator \u03c1\u0302 of the system in the Schr\u00f6dinger\npicture and to use quasi-probability functionals. In this\napproach to the quantum dynamics of open problems, the\nintracavity dynamics is described by a master equation\n[20]:\n\n(14)\n\n1\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n= [\u0124, \u03c1\u0302] + \u039b\u03c1\u0302,\n\u2202t\nih\u0304\n\nA direct solution of these non-linear Langevin equations of operators is impractical, requiring the solution of\nan infinite hierarchy of equations for the evolution of all\nthe products of operators that are coupled by the dynam\u0124 = h\u0304\n\nZ\n\nd2 ~x\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u0124 is the Hamiltonian\n\ni\nX h\n2\ng\n\u03b3j \u00c2\u2020j (~x)(\u2206j \u2212 aj \u22072 )\u00c2j (~x) + i\u03b31 v \u00c2\u20201 (~x)\u2202y \u00c21 (~x) + iE0 (~x)(\u00c2\u20200 (~x) \u2212 \u00c20 (~x)) + i (\u00c20 (~x)\u00c2\u20201 (~x) \u2212 h.c.).\n2\nj=0,1\na minimum allowed width [21]. Generally these problems have been avoided by using linearization schemes\n[22]. Such linearization approximations, however, are\nvalid only for small damped fluctuations. They cannot\nbe used in a convective regime as the reference state is\nunstable and the fluctuations, far from being small, are\namplified. The alternative of the P positive representation [24] is not suitable for the same reason and the\nunstable reference state results in diverging trajectories.\n\nThe Liouvillian \u039b accounts for dissipation through the\npartially reflecting mirrors of the cavity and is given by\n[6]\nn\no\nX Z\n\u039b\u03c1\u0302 =\nd2 ~x\u03b3j [\u00c2j (~x), \u03c1\u0302\u00c2\u2020j (~x)] + [\u00c2j (~x)\u03c1\u0302, \u00c2\u2020j (~x)] .\nj=0,1\n\nThe master equation (15) can be mapped onto an equation of motion for one of a number of quasi-probability\ndistributions in the phase-space of the system [20\u201322].\nThese distributions are functionals of the c-number fields\n\u03b1i (~x) associated with the operators \u00c2i (~x). This evolution equation is obtained by substituting products of field\noperators and the density operator, depending on the ordering, by suitable operations on the distribution functionals [6,8].\nThe evolution equations obtained in this way for the\ndistributions are functional partial differential equations.\nThese are not in general of the Fokker-Planck type and\ndo not lead to well-behaved stochastic representations in\nterms of Langevin equations driven by Gaussian white\nnoise. In particular the Hamiltonian term describing the\n\u03c72 interaction gives a contribution:\n\u0012\n2\n\u03b42\n1 \u2212 s2 \u03b4 3\n[\u00c20 (~x)\u00c2\u20201 (~x) \u2212 h.c., \u03c1\u0302]\u21d0\u21d2 s\u03b10 2 +\n\u03b4\u03b11\n4 \u03b4\u03b121 \u03b4\u03b1\u22170\n\u0013\n\u03b4\n\u03b4 2\n\u03b11 \u2212 2\u03b10 \u03b1\u22171\n+ c.c. Ws .\n+\n\u03b4\u03b10\n\u03b4\u03b11\n\nThese problems of the convective regime can be illustrated by comparison with the situation of a DOPO below the threshold of signal generation. In this case the\nstable solution is a homogeneous pump with an amplitude that depends on the coherent driving field. The\nsignal field is zero on average, but its fluctuations show a\nlevel of self-organization that increases near the threshold. This is the regime of quantum images [4\u20136], noisy\nprecursors generated by quantum noise. These images\nreflect the presence of eigenmodes of the linearized equations, whose eigenvalues are such that their negative real\npart approaches zero at threshold. The fluctuations of\nthese eigenmodes are the least damped ones and dominate the dynamics of the signal. The important point is\nthat the intensity of such quantum images of the signal\nis of the order of quantum noise, while the pump has a\nmacroscopic mean value. It is then possible to neglect the\nfluctuations in the pump, approximating it by a classical\ncoherent field [22]. In this approximation the Hamiltonian is a quadratic function of the quantum operators.\nThe consequence is that a well defined Fokker-Planck\nequation for the Wigner distribution is obtained. Such\nFokker-Planck equations can be represented in terms\nof stochastic Langevin equations for the c-number field\n\u03b11 (~x) [6]. The same type of approximation, linearizing\naround a pattern solution [8], is generally possible in the\nabsolutely unstable regime above threshold. A common\nfeature of these two regimes (absolutely stable and unstable) is that quantum noise does not change drastically the\nsolution with respect to the stable deterministic solution.\nThis means that in the stochastic representation, fluctu-\n\nwhere the parameter s depends on the ordering. This\nterm does not fulfill the requirements that guarantee a\npositive definite solution for Ws : in the Wigner representation (s = 0) we find third order derivatives, while it\nis known [23] that positiveness requires a Fokker-Planck\nform of the master equation (only first and second order\nderivatives) or to include derivatives to all orders. For\nthe P (s = 1) and Q (s = \u22121) representation third order\nderivatives disappear, but the diffusion matrix is not positive definite so that positive solutions are again not guaranteed, although the Q retains positivity through having\n4\n\n\fations only induce the trajectory to visit a small region in\nphase space in the neighborhood of the deterministic solution. In the convective regime the classical deterministic solution is unstable and macroscopically different from\nthe stochastic solution. In this regime quantum noise in\nthe DOPO is amplified, destroying the zero-valued homogeneous deterministic solution for the down-converted\nfield and driving the system into noise sustained states\nhaving a macroscopic number of photons.\n\nthis regime. Our aim is to be able to treat the macroscopic quantum fluctuations associated with the signal\nfield in the convective regime.\nIn the convective regime there are large signal fluctuations around the unstable solution A1 = 0. The coupling of signal and pump gives the nonlinear saturation\nfor these amplified fluctuations. On the other hand, the\npump field is always macroscopic and stable, with small\ndamped fluctuations. This suggests the approximation of\nneglecting quantum noise in the pump and approximating it by a classical field A0 (~x, t). In this way we obtain\na Hamiltonian that is quadratic in the operators describing the quantum dynamics of the signal field. For such\nquadratic Hamiltonians, the Wigner quasi-probability\nfunctional of the complex function \u03b11 (~x, t) obeys the\nfollowing Fokker-Planck equation in which the classical\npump field A0 (~x, t) appears parametrically:\n\nIV. TIME DEPENDENT PARAMETRIC\nAPPROXIMATION\n\nIn this section we we propose an approximate description of the quantum dynamics of the DOPO in the convective regime, based on the main physical features of\n\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0015\n\u2202W (\u03b11 ; A0 )\n\u03b4\n\u03b42\n2\n\u2217\n\u03b31 [(1 + i\u22061 ) \u2212 ia1 \u2207 \u2212 v\u2202y ]\u03b11 (~x, t) + gA0 (~x, t)\u03b11 (~x, t) + c.c. + \u03b31\n= \u2212\nW (\u03b11 ; A0 )).\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03b11\n\u03b4\u03b11 \u03b4\u03b1\u22171\nbe the same should be choose to use a different quasiprobability. This procedure gives a partial differential\nequation for the \"classical\" pump field driven by the cnumber representation of the quantum signal field:\n\nThe associated Langevin equation that represents the\nstochastic dynamics of the signal field \u03b11 (~x, t) is\n\u2202t \u03b11 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b31 [(1 + i\u22061 ) \u2212 ia1 \u22072 \u2212 v\u2202y ]\u03b11 (~x, t) +\n\u221a\n(16)\ngA0 (~x, t)\u03b1\u22171 (~x, t) + \u03b31 \u03be1 (~x, t),\n\n\u2202t A0 (~x, t) = \u2212\u03b30 [(1 + i\u22060 ) \u2212 ia0 \u22072 ]A0 (~x, t)\ng\n\u2212 \u03b121 (~x, t) + E0 (~x)\n(17)\n2\n\nwhere \u03be1 (~x, t) is a complex Gaussian white noise (see\nEq.(3)). This noise term accurately represents the effects of vacuum fluctuations associated with cavity losses\non the signal field. We note that treating the pump field\nclassically in this way is a natural extension of the parametric approximation to three-mode interactions, which\ntreats a strong mode classically and has been widely used\nin quantum optics for many years [25].\nIt is important to note that A0 (~x, t) cannot be replaced\nby an expectation value of h\u00c20 i as would be possible in\nthe regime of absolute stability (quantum images). Such\nan ansatz decorrelates the pump modes from the subharmonic ones and eliminates the saturation effect of the\npump. In fact, with such an ansatz Eq. (16) becomes\nlinear, giving a Gaussian probability distribution for the\nsignal modes. This distribution would always be centered on zero, but with statistical moments that diverge\nabove threshold because the signal modes are undamped\nin the convective regime. Therefore, the stochastic differential equation must be solved self-consistently with\nan equation defining the dynamics of the classical field\nA0 . The equation we propose for A0 is suggested by the\nHeisenberg equation (12), with \u00c20 replaced by a classical\nfield A0 . We first neglect the noise source in (12) since\nquantum fluctuations entering in the cavity are unimportant, as compared with the macroscopic fluctuations\nof the signal term \u00c221 . Secondly we replace the operator \u00c221 by the c-number function \u03b121 associated with\nour stochastic representation of the signal. This replacement is independent of operator ordering and hence will\n\nA justification for this equation is that its mean value coincides with the expectation value for \u00c20 obtained from\nthe operator equation (12). This procedure is reminiscent of the time-dependent refinement of the parametric\napproximation described in some detail by Kumar and\nMehta [26]. This approach allows for the quantum evolution of the weak fields to feed back and affect the classical\nstrong field. In the approach of Kumar and Mehta, this\nfeedback is via quantum expectation values of operators\nfor the weak fields. Here, however, we are required to take\nexplicit account of the noisy properties of the quantum\nsub-harmonic field. We do this by using the c-number\nrepresentation of the quantum field, associated with our\nstochastic simulation of it, as a term in equation (17).\nIn summary, our time dependent parametric approximation is defined by stochastic classical equations in the\nWigner representation for the fields A0 and \u03b11 , which,\nwith the scaling (4), are:\n\u2202t A0 (~x, t) = \u2212[(1 + i\u22060 ) \u2212 i\u22072 ]A0 (~x, t)\n1\n\u2212 \u03b121 (~x, t) + E0 (~x)\n2\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202t \u03b11 (~x, t) = \u2212 (1 + i\u22061 ) \u2212 2i\u22072 \u2212 v\u2202y \u03b11 (~x, t)\n1 g\n+A0 (~x, t)\u03b1\u22171 (~x, t) + D/4 \u03be1 (~x, t).\n\u03b3\na\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nStochastic averages of the c-number variable \u03b11 (~x, t) will\nprovide symmetrically ordered averages of the quantum\n5\n\n\fpresent such numerical simulations working with a single\ntransverse dimension (D = 1) [27].\nFig. 2 is a space-time plot of the near-field for the\nsignal in the below-threshold, convective and absolutely\nunstable regimes. Fig. 3 gives the far-fields associated\nwith the same simulations. In the following we discuss\nthe different properties of these trajectories and how they\nare reflected in the associated Wigner distribution. In\nparticular, we consider the phase space dynamics of the\nmost intense modes of the signal pattern. The Wigner\nprobability distribution associated with these modes displays distinctly non-Gaussian features in the convective\nregime. These are a result of the interplay of non-linear\nand walk-off effects. It is clear that they cannot be described within a linearization scheme that does not take\naccount of this interplay between the signal and pump\nfields.\n\nfluctuations in the signal field as driven by the \"classical\" pump field. The classical pump field is driven by the\nmacroscopic quantum fluctuations in the signal as represented by the c-number representation \u03b11 (~x, t). This\ntime dependent parametric approximation appears useful in situations in which there are large fluctuations of\nthe signal that cannot be described by approximations\nbased on linearization.\nV. STOCHASTIC TRAJECTORIES AND\nWIGNER DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION\n\nNumerical simulation of the stochastic trajectories associated with the Langevin equations (18) and (19) gives\na good intuitive understanding of the dynamical properties of the regime below threshold, the convective regime\nand the absolutely unstable regime.

Same parameters as in Fig. 2\n\n6\n\n\fspace trajectory for the slowly varying amplitude of the\ndominating Fourier component, \u03b1\u20321 (kc , t), is shown in Fig.\n4(a).\nThe linear stability analysis of Sect. II also identified\nthe direction of instability V+ . In particular, in the case\nof a real pump, and for the critical mode kc , this direction\nis given by [\u03b11 (+kc )+\u03b1\u22171 (\u2212kc )]. As a consequence the superposition of modes [\u03b11 (+kc ) + \u03b11 (\u2212kc )] can be decomposed in two quadratures, one corresponding to the direction of instability that becomes undamped at threshold (Re[\u03b11 (+kc )+\u03b11 (\u2212kc )]), and the orthogonal quadrature (Im[\u03b11 (+kc ) + \u03b11 (\u2212kc )]) that remains damped. We\nobserve that the superposition of slowly varying modes\n\u03b1\u20321 (\u00b1kc , t) can be decomposed into damped and undamped quadrature in the same way. In fact due to\nthe symmetry \u03c9(k) = \u2212\u03c9(\u2212k) we have V\u00b1 (~k, \u2212~k) =\n~\nei\u03c9(k)t [ei\u03a6\u00b1 \u03b4A\u20321 (~k)\u00b1\u03b4A\u2032\u2217\n1 (\u2212k)], so that the relative phase\nei\u03a6\u00b1 between the slowly varying modes is the same as\nthat in the equation (10). Hence, we can also identify\nthe real and imaginary quadratures of the superposition of modes [\u03b1\u20321 (+kc ) + \u03b1\u20321 (\u2212kc )] as damped and undamped at threshold. The corresponding time trajectory\nof this superposition of modes displays very clearly the\nexpected reduction of fluctuations in the damped imaginary quadrature (see Fig. 4(b)).\n\nA. Below threshold\n\nBelow but close to threshold we find weakly damped\nfluctuations which are a precursor to the traveling pattern that appears at threshold. The fluctuations impose\na degree of spatial self-organization in those regions in\nwhich the pump is sufficiently strong to bring the OPO\nclose to threshold. In Fig. 2(a) we plot the real part\nof the stochastic variable \u03b11 (x, t) for a single trajectory.\nThis is a realization of these fluctuations for a pump with\na supergaussian profile [28]. Noisy patterns of this form\nhave been predicted for the below-threshold OPO without walk-off and have been termed quantum images [4\u20136].\nNot too close to threshold, the damped fluctuations can\nbe analyzed with linearization procedures [6] in the limit\nof small fluctuations. Our nonlinear quantum equations\nenable us to study also the regime closer to threshold,\nwhere large critical fluctuations are expected to occur.\nNote, in particular, that the results in Fig. 2(a) were\nobtained for F = 0.999.\nThe selection of a preferred wave-number in the\nstochastic pattern of Fig. 2(a) becomes more evident\nin the far field shown in Fig. 3(a). It is clear that there\nare preferred values of the wave-number but that a broad\ndistribution of weakly damped modes around these preferred kc and \u2212kc modes is apparent.\n\nFIG. 4.

Parameters of Fig.4. Total time\n2.000.000 units. Note the factor 10 difference in the scale of\nthe two axes.\n\nAn interesting characterization of the stochastic dynamics in the far field, Fig. 3(a), is obtained by looking\nat the time evolution of the stochastic amplitudes for the\nmost intense modes \u03b11 (kc , t). We first recall that the linear stability analysis of Sect. II identifies the existence\nof a non-vanishing frequency (\u03c9(k) = vk) at threshold\ncaused by the walk-off. This implies that a traveling\npattern will emerge above threshold and that the corresponding Fourier modes will oscillate at this frequency.\nWe can remove this time-dependence by working in a\nframe rotating at this frequency. This corresponds to\nfactoring out a time factor ei\u03c9(k)t to obtaining the slowly\nvarying amplitude \u03b1\u20321 (k, t) = \u03b11 (k, t)e\u2212i\u03c9(k)t . A phase\n\nFrom the stochastic trajectories that randomly visit\nthe different points of phase space it is easy to construct\na relative histogram giving a probability density in this\nphase space. This density is identified with the Wigner\ndistribution. As with all Wigner functions, the marginal\ndistributions, obtained for one field quadrature by integrating over the orthogonal quadrature, are true probability distributions for the remaining quadrature. At\na finite distance from threshold the Wigner distribution\nW (\u03b11 (k)) for the field \u03b11 (k) obtained in this way has\n7\n\n\fThe continuous changes in intensity from zero to macroscopic values originate in the fact that, in the convective regime, a given mode is not constantly switched-on\n(see Fig.3(b)). The pattern is sustained by noise and is\nsubject to a continuous renovation: different stripe patterns (with different wave-numbers) grow, travel in the\nsystem starting from noise and die out. This has an important consequence in the time scales of the far field\ndynamics: below threshold these scales are determined\nby noise, while in the convective regime they are determined by the time needed for a perturbation to travel\nthrough the system. Another indication of the nonlinear dynamics of fluctuations that occur in this regime is\nthat the quadrature displaying reduced fluctuations is no\nlonger the one determined by the linear analysis. This is\nseen in Fig. 6(b) where the ellipse of fluctuations is tilted\nwith respect to the corresponding one below threshold\nFig. 4(b).\n\na Gaussian shape consistent with a linearized analysis\nof fluctuations. Such a Gaussian Wigner distribution is\na solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner\nrepresentation of linear signal fluctuations. If we consider\nthe Wigner distribution for the superposition of modes\ndiscussed above W (\u03b11 (+kc )+\u03b11 (\u2212kc )), then we obtain a\nGaussian centered on the origin but with a variance that\ndepends on the orientation in phase space [29]. There\nis an axis with a reduced variance ('squeezed') and the\northogonal one with a larger variance ('anti-squeezed')\n(see Fig. 5). These features reflect the asymmetry or\nphase-sensitivity of the fluctuations already visualized in\nthe stochastic trajectory.\nB. Convective regime\n\nDifferences between the regime below threshold and\nthe convective regime are clearly seen both in the near\nand far signal fields. We observe a macroscopic traveling\npattern in the near field (Fig. 2(b)). This is clearly associated with wave-numbers distributed around the value\nof the selected one (kM ) in the far field (Fig. 3(b)). The\nspectrum of excited wave-numbers is clearly narrower in\nthe convective regime than below threshold. This is reflected in the more regular pattern appearing in the near\nfield. Our simulations display the typical features associated with the convective regime [13]:\n\u2022 The noise sustained pattern does not fill the whole\nregion in which the pump has a value above threshold. This is because the pattern grows while traveling in the walk-off direction. Note that the space\npoint at which the pattern reaches a macroscopic\nobservable value changes randomly from time to\ntime. This reflects the origin of the pattern in\n(quantum) noise.\n\nFIG. 6.\n(a) Trajectory of slowly varying amplitude of \u03b1\u20321 (+kc ) during 100.000 time units.

There is competition between the\nmodes within this broad spectrum and hence it\nis not possible to define, in this regime, a single\nwave-number kM corresponding to the most excited modes. Modes with different wave-numbers\ncompete to form the pattern, switching on and off\nas the pattern evolves.\nFIG. 7.\nW(\u03b11 (+k) + \u03b11 (\u2212k)), for an excited mode\nk = 1.04kc , obtained from a trajectory during 10.000.000 time\nunits. Other parameters as in Fig. 6.\n\nPhase space trajectories for this regime are shown in\nFig. 6. We find that there are random changes in the\nphase and amplitude of the slowly varying signal \u03b1\u20321 (+kc )\naround a zero mean value (Fig. 6(a)). This is similar to\nthe behavior depicted in Fig. 4(a) below threshold. The\ndifference is that in the convective regime macroscopic\nintensities are reached, with the signal amplitude taking\nvalues comparable to those reached in the absolutely unstable regime (compare scales of Figs. 4(a), 6(a), and 9).\n\nThe probability distributions obtained from the trajectories of Fig. 6 also reflect the nonlinear nature\nof the fluctuations in this regime. In Fig. 7 we\nshow the W distribution for the superposition of modes\n[\u03b11 (+k) + \u03b11 (\u2212k)] for one of the most excited wave8\n\n\fnumbers, namely k = 1.04kc. A most noticeable feature\nis the non-Gaussian shape of the distribution for large\nvalues of the amplitude in the direction of undamped\nfluctuations. The wings of the distribution originate in\nthe macroscopic fluctuations of the mode under consideration when it switches-on. Its most probable value is still\nzero, reflecting the fact that most of the time the mode\nremains switched-off. We can view these nongaussian features in the wings of our Wigner functions as precursors\nof the pair of peaks appearing in the absolutely unstable regime. These wings become more pronounced as we\napproach the absolutely unstable regime.\nFinally, we note that the modes that become excited\nand contribute to the dynamics seem to reach a common maximum amplitude. This is probably fixed by the\nmaximum value of the energy exchanged with the pump\nmode in the nonlinear interaction. This is shown in Fig.8\nwhere the possible values of different modes are seen to\nbe cut-off at essentially the same amplitude. The nongaussian form of these distributions is also clear and this\nagain demonstrates that we are dealing with nonlinear\neffects associated with the quantum fluctuations.\n\ntensity are maintained. Although there is essentially only\nthe phase diffusion for kM , the critical mode, with wavenumber kc , displays a second frequency superimposed on\nthe phase diffusion process.\n\nFIG. 9.

We\nobserve that fluctuations are not uniformly distributed\naround a zero value as they were in the below threshold\n(Fig. 4) and convective (Fig. 6) regimes. Instead, they\ndescribe a closed curve around the origin. The associated W distributions display peaks at two values. These\ncorrespond to the two points of maximum curvature of\nthe elliptical ring.\n\nFIG. 8. Section of the Wigner distribution along the imaginary axis W (0, Im(\u03b11 (k))) for 3 excited modes: kc (dashed\nline), k\u2032 = 1.04kc (dash dot line), k\u2032\u2032 = 1.06kc (continuous\nline). Same parameters as Fig. 6.\n\nC. Absolutely unstable regime\n\nIn the absolutely unstable regime we observe from the\nnear field plot, Fig. 2(c), that a macroscopic and stable\ntraveling pattern fills the whole of the above threshold\nregion. This behavior is reflected in the far field, Fig.\n3(c), which shows a well-defined and fixed dominant wave\nnumber and a narrow spatial spectrum. We should note\nthat the dominant wave-number kM does not coincide\nwith the most unstable wave-number at threshold (kc ).\nThis is a consequence of the interplay between nonlinearities and walk-off. Phase space trajectories for the amplitudes of these two modes are shown in Fig. 9.

Note the\ndifferent vertical scales in the figures.\n\nThe main characteristics of the trajectories in phase\nspace are reflected in the associated Wigner distributions.\nFor the less intense modes contributing to the dynamics we can approximate the associated Wigner function\nW (\u03b11 (k)) by a Gaussian, displaced from and orbiting\nabout the origin in phase space. In Fig.11(a) we show\na cut along the real direction of the Wigner distribution\nfor the critical mode (W (Re[\u03b11 (kc )], 0)). By contrast,\nthe most intense mode (with wave-number kM ) displays\nsome interesting new features. Fig.11(b) shows an asymmetry in the distribution of fluctuations around the mean\namplitude in each of the peaks, with a sharp decay of the\ndistribution at some maximum amplitude. These facts\nindicate the existence of nonlinear properties associated\nwith the quantum fluctuations in the absolutely unstable\nregime. These features would necessarily be absent in\nany analysis based on a linearization about a deterministic macroscopic state.\n\nIt is helpful, in looking for non-classical effects, to keep\nin mind the manner in which such effects appear below\nthreshold. We will also restrict ourselves to the study\nof quantum correlations in the far field. Conditions for\nsqueezing and associated non-classical effects are usually\nexpressed in terms of normally ordered moments of operators (indicated by : :). These can be obtained from\nthe symmetrically ordered moments (indicated by S()),\nthat are associated with the Wigner function, by use of\nthe commutation relations (11):\nh: \u00c2(k, t)\u00c2(k \u2032 , t) :i = hS(\u00c2(k, t)\u00c2(k \u2032 , t))i\n\n1\nh: \u00c2(k, t)\u00c2\u2020 (k \u2032 , t) :i = hS(\u00c2(k, t)\u00c2\u2020 (k \u2032 , t))i \u2212 \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 )\n2\nThe \u03b4 function appearing in the second of these equations\nis a signature of the shot or vacuum noise. Our approximation scheme is based in the Wigner representation and\ngives results for correlations of symmetrically ordered operators for the intracavity fields. In order to obtain results for the corresponding normally ordered products\nand to test for the presence of non-classical effects, we\nneed to establish a reference shot noise level. This level\ncan be obtained for each quadrature correlation from the\nvariance of the linear stochastic process associated with\nthe empty cavity:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 g\n\u2202t s(x, t) = \u2212 (1 + i\u22061 ) \u2212 2i\u22072 s(x, t) + 1/4 \u03be1 (x, t).\na \u03b3\n\nVI. NON-CLASSICAL PROPERTIES IN THE\nCONVECTIVE REGIME.\n\nThe convective regime is characterized by amplified\nfluctuations and macroscopic noisy patterns. It is interesting to ask, therefore, if any of the low-noise quantum\nfeatures found below threshold can survive in this noisy\nenvironment. Quantum effects in the OPO have been\nobserved as sub-shot noise fluctuations both in the field\nquadratures and intensity differences associated with the\ndown-converted light [30]. Examples of the noisy features\nassociated with the real part of the signal field in this\nregime are plotted in Fig. 12 for three different values of\nthe driving field, all within the convective regime. Note\nthe different scales on the vertical axes in these figures.\n\nHere we have omitted the walk-off term as it does not\naffect the shot noise level. Squeezing in our simulations\nwill be associated with a quadrature probability distribution that is narrower than the Gaussian associated with\nthis linear process. In general we can consider a different\nquadrature for each wave-number k. It is useful to define\na pair of (superposition mode) quadratures for each k parameterized by the angle \u03b8. For the critical wave-number\nthese take the form\ni\n1h\nX\u0302\u00b1 (\u03b8) =\n\u00c21 (kc , t) \u00b1 \u00c21 (\u2212kc , t) ei\u03b8 + h.c..\n(20)\n2\nWe expect, in general, that the most strongly squeezed\nquadrature should depend on the value of \u03b8 [7].\nWe begin our investigation of the convective regime\nat a point that is just above threshold with F = 1.001\n(Fig. 12(a)). Fluctuations associated with the pattern\nare in this case still relatively small and we find that the\nWigner distribution has a Gaussian shape as shown in\nFig.13. We find that there is quadrature squeezing, with\nthe squeezed quadrature X\u0302\u2212 (0) exhibiting the same level\nof squeezing as is found just below threshold. In particular, for F = Fthr \u00b1 0.001 we find that the intracavity\nfield is squeezed by 50% below the shot noise limit for\na flat pump and by 37% for a supergaussian pump [31].\n10\n\n\fThis indicates a smooth variation across threshold for the\nsqueezed quadrature variance. For excited modes, other\nthan the critical one, we also find squeezing below the\nshot noise level for the appropriate quadrature.\n\nA further indication of the nonlinear nature of the fluctuations in the convective regime is given by the fact that\nthe angle \u03b8, for which there is the greatest reduction in\nthe fluctuations, changes with the strength of the pump\nvalue. This has already been discussed in connection with\nFig. 6(a). In particular, for the critical wave-number,\nX\u0302\u2212 (\u03b8) shows strongest squeezing for \u03b8 = 0 in the linear regime below threshold. In the convective regime,\nhowever, the greatest reduction in the quadrature fluctuations occurs for a value of \u03b8 < 0. This is shown in\nFig. 14 in which we plot the variance Var(X\u0302\u2212 (\u03b8)) in normal ordering and normalized to the shot noise level, for\nF = 1.025.\nThe OPO can also exhibit strong correlations between the far field intensities associated with opposite wave-numbers. We have calculated the fluctuations in the intensity difference for opposite wavenumbers associated with the normally ordered moment\n\u00112\n\u0010 \u2020\n\u2020\nh: \u00c21 (k)\u00c21 (k) \u2212 \u00c21 (\u2212k)\u00c21 (\u2212k) :i. A negative value for this quantity indicates a non-classical effect sometimes referred to as twin beams or intensity-difference\nsqueezing [32]. As in our discussion of quadrature squeezing, we find that this quantity is only negative very near\nto threshold (F = 1.001). Further into the convective\nregime we find that the macroscopic noise associated with\nthe formation of a pattern increases the noise in the intensity difference. For F = 1.01 we find that the intensitydifference squeezing has been replaced by fluctuations in\nexcess of the shot noise level.\nIn summary, we have shown that quantum effects can\nsurvive above threshold in the convective regime but only\nvery near to threshold. On increasing the pump and entering further into the convective regime, we find that\nnon-linear effects associated with the fluctuations tend to\ndistribute part of the macroscopic fluctuations into the\nobservables that are squeezed nearer to threshold. This\nidentifies walk-off as an effective mechanism of quantum\ndecoherence in which the macroscopic nonlinear fluctuations present in the convective regime overwhelm quantum effects associated with noise reduction.\n\nFIG. 13. W (Re(\u03b11 (kc , t) \u2212 \u03b11 (\u2212kc , t)), 0). Continuous line\nis obtained for F = 1.001, and dotted line for F = 1.01. The\ndashed line represents the distribution for the vacuum state,\ncorresponding to the shot noise level. The distributions are\nrelative to trajectories of 2.000.000 time units. Other parameters as in Fig. 12.\n\nIncreasing the value of the pump, so as to move further\ninto the convective regime, leads to a rapid increase in\nthe magnitude of the signal field. Indeed, for (F = 1.01)\nwe observe, in Fig. 12(b) that the signal field has grown\nby two orders of magnitude. Fluctuations are still extremely phase sensitive and, as depicted in Fig. 6(a)\nthere is a strong reduction in the fluctuations for some\nquadratures. This reduction is insufficient, however, to\nreach below the shot noise level and there is no squeezing.\nIn fact, we find residual fluctuations +27% above the shot\nnoise level. This is comparable with the value associated\nwith the coherent states. These enhanced fluctuations\nare associated with a much broader Wigner distribution\nas shown in Fig. 13. It is remarkable, however, that this\nenhanced but still small level of fluctuation can coexist\nwith the macroscopic fluctuations in orthogonal quadrature. If we move still further above threshold then we\nfind, for F = 1.025 (Fig. 12(c)), a variance which is 159\ntimes the shot noise level and both quadratures display\nfluctuations that are well above the level usually associated with quantum effects. We note that for the parameter values used here, the threshold of absolute instability\nfor an infinite system occurs at F \u223c 1.035.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have introduced a suitable method to describe the\nquantum properties of macroscopic patterns sustained\nby quantum fluctuations in a degenerate optical parametric oscillator with walk-off. These patterns appear in\nthe convective regime and are characterized by a broad\nfar field spectrum with continuous competition between\nseveral wave-numbers (thus, few mode approximations\nare not adequate) and by being the result of amplified\nquantum fluctuations around a unstable reference state.\nTraditional linearization techniques cannot be applied in\nthese situations. Instead we use a time dependent parametric approximation in which the pump field is treated\n\nFIG. 14. Var(X\u0302\u2212 (\u03b8)) at F = 1.025 for the critical wavenumber k = kc . The minimum occurs for \u03b8 < 0.\n\n11\n\n\fciety of Edinburgh and the Scottish Executive Education\nand Lifelong Learning Department for financial support.\n\nas a c-number variable but driven by the c-number representation of the quantum sub-harmonic signal field. The\nkey point is that this includes the effects of the fluctuations in the signal on the pump which in turn act back\non the signal.\nUsing this method we have described the quantum fluctuations in type-I OPO with walk-off in three regimes:\nbelow the threshold of instability, in the convective unstable regime and in the absolute unstable regime.\nBelow threshold we find that the Wigner representation has a Gaussian shape centered at the origin. This is\nthe result previously found in a OPO without walk-off [6]\nfrom a linearized analysis. We also find that the walk-off\ndoes not destroy the existence of squeezing in suitable\nquadratures.\nIn the convective regime the macroscopic character of\nthe fluctuations is reflected in a extremely broad Wigner\ndistribution where the probability is still centered at the\norigin but the nonlinear effects lead to the appearance of\nwings in the distribution which is no longer a Gaussian.\nThese wings are in fact precursors of the pair of peaks\nappearing in the absolutely convective regime. We show\nthat squeezing in the appropriate observables can be also\nobtained in this regime but only just above threshold.\nThe walk-off and the nonlinearities act as quantum decoherence mechanism, distributing part of the macroscopic\nfluctuations into the observables that were squeezed below threshold. Another nonlinear effect appears in the\nselection of the quadrature displaying reduced fluctuations, that is no longer the one determined linearly.\nIn the absolutely unstable regime there are also clear\nindications of nonlinear properties associated with quantum fluctuations. The interplay between walk-off and\nnon-linearity results in a complex dynamics in which the\nfrequencies of far-field modes are not constant, giving a\ncomplicated variation of the phases. Also, the most intense mode is not the critical mode. We find that while\nthe Wigner distribution for the less intense modes can be\napproximated by a Gaussian (displaced from the origin\nand orbiting about it) this is not the case for the most\nintense modes for which the distribution of fluctuations\nis asymmetric around the mean amplitude with a sharp\ndecay at some maximum amplitude.\nFinally, our method can be used in other situations and\nsystems in which there are large fluctuations of the signal\nthat cannot be described by approximations based on linearization. This includes situations in which the critical\nfluctuations appear at threshold for pattern generation.\n\n[1] S. Ducci, N. Tr\u00eaps, A. Ma\u0131\u0302tre, and C. Fabre, Phys.
