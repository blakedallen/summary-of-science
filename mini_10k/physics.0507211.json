The SEM is a\nsegmented grid made with 5 \u03bcm Ti foils, intended for use in the 120 GeV NuMI\nbeam at Fermilab. Similar to previous workers, we found that the full collection of\nthe secondary electron signal requires a bias voltage to draw the ejected electrons\ncleanly off the foils, and this effect is more pronounced at larger beam intensity. The\nbeam centroid and width resolutions of the SEM were measured at beam widths\nof 3, 7, and 8 mm, and compared to calculations. Extrapolating the data from this\nbeam test, we expect a centroid and width resolutions of \u03b4xbeam = 20 \u03bcm and\n\u03b4\u03c3beam = 25 \u03bcm, respectively, in the NuMI beam which has 1 mm spot size.\nKey words: particle beam, instrumentation, secondary electron emission\nPACS: 07.77Ka, 29.27Ac, 29.27Fh, 29.40.-n\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeam profiles may be measured via the process of secondary electron emission[1].\nA secondary electron monitor (SEM) consists of a metal screen of low work\nfunction from which low (<100 eV) energy electrons are ejected.

Schematic of a segmented secondary emission monitor (SEM): electrons\nejected by the signal planes are drawn away by bias planes at a positive voltage.\n\npass through the device, permitting their use as beam monitors[2]. Furthermore, the process of secondary electron emission is a surface phenomenon[3],\nso that electron emitting foils or wires of very thin (1-10 \u03bcm) dimensions may\nbe used without penalty to the signal size[4]. Often a positive voltage on a\nnearby foil (\"clearing field\") is used to draw the secondary electrons cleanly\naway from the signal screen. A schematic SEM is shown in Figure 1.\nSecondary electron emission monitors have replaced ionization chambers as\nbeam monitors for over 40 years[2]. An ionization chamber monitors beam intensity by measuring the ionized charge in a gas volume collected on a chamber\nelectrode. Such a device places a large amount of material (\u223c 10\u22122 \u221210\u22123 \u03bbint )\nin the beam which results in emittance blowup and beam loss, both of which\nare unacceptable in high intensity beams. A further limitation of ionization\nchambers is that space charge buildup limits them to measurements of beams\nwith intenstities of < 1016 particles/cm2 /sec[5], nearly 5 orders of magnitude\nbelow requirements of present extracted beamlines. SEM's, in contrast, are\nextremely linear in response [2,6], and the prototype SEM discussed in this\nnote is 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 interaction lengths thick.\nFor the NuMI beam [7], we desire a segmented SEM which measures the\nbeam intensity, the beam centroid position, and the beam's lateral profile.\nThe beam spot is anticipated to be \u223c1mm. The required SEM segmentation\nis of order 1mm. The two SEM's near the NuMI target require segmentation\nof 0.5mm in order to specify the beam position and angle onto the target at\nthe 50 \u03bcrad level. The segmented SEM will measure profile out to 22 mm\nin the horizontal and vertical. A single, large foil will cover the remaining\naperture out to 50 mm radius in order to measure any potential beam halo.\nAdditional thin foil SEM's are envisaged for the 8 GeV transport line for\nthe MiniBooNE experiment [8] and for the transfer line between the 8 GeV\nBooster and 120 GeV Main Injector at FNAL.\n2\n\n\fA prototype SEM was tested in the 8 GeV beam transport line for the MiniBooNE experiment in May 2003. While the MiniBooNE beam parameters\ndiffer from those anticipated for NuMI (see Table 1), this test permitted early\nverification of the foil SEM design. Some differences, listed in Table 1, exist\nbetween the foils designed for the prototype and the final SEM chambers installed in the NuMI line. Further details of the prototype design are given in\nSection 2, while the final SEM design description can be found in Ref [9].\nDuring the beam tests, the SEM was used to measure beam position and size\nat one location in the MiniBooNE line. Because it was the only profile monitor\nin that portion of the transport line, no independent measurement existed to\ncorroborate the prototype's beam size measurements. A pair of nearby capacitative Beam Position Monitors (BPM's) was able to corroborate the SEM's\nbeam centroid measurement. The SEM's expected beam centroid resolution\nand beam width resolution are related, however, because both depend upon\nseveral aspects of the SEM design, such as readout noise and the position\naccuracy of the segmented SEM grid assembly. In this note, we analyze the\nSEM's centroid and width resolution during the test in the MiniBooNE line.\nThese measurements are compared to calculations of expected centroid resolution performance. Following the validation of the calculations using the test\nbeam data, we extrapolate the expected beam size resolution achievable from\nthe SEM's to the case for the narrow NuMI beam.\n\nBEAM\n\nMiniBooNE\n\nNuMI\n\nProton energy (GeV)\n\n8\n\n120\n\nIntensity (\u00d71012 ppp)\n\n5\n\n40\n\nSpill Rate (Hz)\n\n5\n\n0.5\n\nSpill Duration (\u03bcs)\n\n1.56\n\n8.67\n\nHorizontal beam size (mm)\n\n6-8\n\n1.0\n\n3\n\n1.0\n\nPrototype\n\nFinal SEM\n\nStrip width (mm)\n\n0.75\n\n0.15\n\nStrip pitch (mm)\n\n1\n\n1\n\nVertical beam size (mm)\nSEM\n\nFoil thickness (\u03bcm)\n5\n5\nTable 1\nComparison of MiniBooNE and NuMI beam lines and of the prototype and final\ndesign SEM's.

Photograph of the prototype segmented Foil SEM. At right is the signal\nconnection feedthrough box. At center is the lid of the vacuum chamber for the SEM,\nand at left is the paddle with the foils. The foil paddle moves in and out of the beam\non rails, and the vacuum during the motion is maintained by a bellows feedthrough\nmounted to the vacuum chamber lid. The assembly shown is approximately 75 cm\nlong by 30 cm tall.\n\n2\n\nSEM Prototype\n\nBorrowing from a design in use at CERN [10], the foil SEM built for this\nbeam test had five planes of 5 \u03bcm thick Titanium foils, as in Figure 1. The\nfirst, third, and fifth planes were solid foils biased to as much as 100 Volts.\nPlanes 2 and 4 were segmented at 1 mm pitch (0.75 mm wide strips with\n0.25 mm gaps between adjacent strips). The strips were mounted on ceramic\ncombs with rectangular grooves which mechancally held the strips and aligned\nthem onto the grid. Each strip had an accordion-like spring to tension it and\ncompensate for beam heating. The foil strips for the prototype were quite long,\nranging from 15-25 cm in length. Each strip was read out separately into a\ncharge-integrating circuit[11] gated around the beam spill.\nA new aspect of the present SEM design is that the foils were mounted on\na frame which does not traverse the beam as the SEM is inserted into or retracted from the beam. The segmented foils are mounted at \u00b145\u25e6 to provide\nboth horizontal and vertical beam profiles, and these are mounted on a hexagonal frame which encloses the beam at all times, leaving a clear space when\nit is desired to retract the foils away from the beam, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe signals from the foils are routed through a vacuum bellows feedthrough\n4\n\n\fvia kapton-insulated cables to a signal feedthrough box shown at the right of\nthe photo. While the final NuMI SEM chambers have stepper motor-driven\nactuators [9] to move the foils into or out of the beam, the prototype required\nmanual manipulation of the bellows feedthrough to insert the foil paddle. A\nphotograph of the SEM, mounted in its rectangular vacuum chamber and\ninstalled in the 8 GeV transport line, is shown in Figure 3.\nThe use of Titanium as the active medium was motivated by the loss of Secondary Electron Emission (SEE) signal from other materials after prolonged\nexposure in the beam [12,13,14,15]. For beam nominally on center through a\nlong run, such signal loss results in degraded beam centroid magnitude and\nalso results in artificially enhanced beam tails, since the beam tails irradiate\nthe SEM to a lesser extent. Titanium suffers less from the loss of SEE signal,\neven for relatively simple cleaning and handling procedures for the foils [15].\n\n3\n\nData analysis\n\nFigure 4 shows a schematic of the 8 GeV MiniBooNE transport line elements\nnear the foil SEM location. To analyse the SEM data we wanted to correlate\nit with data from nearby BPM's. However, there is no simple linear relation between all the BPM and SEM data. Changing magnet currents, beam\nposition and intensity causes both the slope and the offset in the relation between SEM and BPM to change. The situation is worse for horizontal than\nfor vertical plane since there are magnets in between the SEM prototype and\n\nFig. 3.

The beam current transformer Tor860 was\nused for intensity monitoring. Only the spills with sufficiently high intensity\n(\u223c 1012 ppp) were analysed.\nFigure 5 shows one example of the horizontal and vertical beam profiles as seen\nby the SEM in one spill with 4.5 \u00d7 1012 protons per pulse (ppp). The vertical\naxis on these plots is the pulse height from a given strip[16]. The beam was\nbroader in the horizontal direction and narrower in the vertical direction. Both\nhorizontal and vertical beam widths roughly agree with expectations based on\nthe \u03b2 functions for the transport line.\n\nFig. 5. Horizontal and verical beam profiles during one spill at 4.5 \u00d7 1012 ppp. The\nfitted beam centroid, width and amplitude are noted in the plots.\n\n6\n\n\fFig. 6. (Normalized) total charge collected from the SEM summed over all 44 strips,\nplotted as a function of the applied bias voltage. The data were taken at several\nbeam intensities, ranging from 4\u00d71011 protons/pulse to 4\u00d71012 protons/pulse.\n\n4\n\nBias Voltage Study\n\nThe voltage applied to the SEM's bias foils was typically 100 Volts, greater\nthan the typical 20-30 eV kinetic energy of secondary electrons emitted from\na foil surface.[1] To understand the effect of the bias voltage on the signal\ncollection efficiency, we accumulated data at several fixed beam intensities\nvarying from 4 \u00d7 1011 protons/pulse (ppp) to 4 \u00d7 1012 ppp. During each period\nof fixed beam intensity, the voltage applied to the bias foils was varied and\nthe total charge collected from all the signal strips measured. The results are\nplotted in Figure 6. The signal collected from the SEM is normalized to 100%\nefficiency by dividing by the signal collected at 4 \u00d7 1012 ppp and 100 Volts.\nBoth the horizontal and vertical signal foils agree within 1.5%. As can be\nseen, applying a voltage increases the efficiency, as has been noted by others\n[12,17]. Also, our data suggest that the required applied voltage to achieve\n100% efficiency increases as the beam intensity increases. The magnitude of\nthis effect may reflect surface impurities on the foils or be caused by the\nrelatively poor vacuum in this chamber, which was several 10\u22127 Torr during\nthe test.\n7\n\n\fFig. 7. (left) The correlation between positions measured by the vertical BPM and\nthose measured by the SEM. (right) The residuals from the best fit line. From the\nresiduals we can infer that the sum in quadrature of BPM and SEM resolutions is\n127\u03bcm.\n\n5\n\nMeasured SEM Centroid Resolution\n\nThe centroid resolution of the SEM depends upon the width of the beam, the\nintensity of the beam, and upon the electronics readout noise on the SEM\nchannels. The beam width in vertical direction was nearly constant at \u03c3x =\n3.4 mm, while the horizontal beam size varied between \u03c3y = 7.4 mm and\n\u03c3y = 8.2 mm, during the test period. This gives us 3 different beam widths\nfor which we try to find the SEM centroid resolution.\nTo find the beam centroid resolution in the vertical plane we correlate its\nreported beam position with that of the BPM labelled VP871. Figure 7 shows\nthe BPM data ploted versus SEM data over a range of spills in which the\nbeam was observed to move substantially across the chambers. The residuals\nof the data from the best fit line are also shown in a figure, and show an RMS\nof 127 \u03bcm. The residuals should be a measure of the two devices' resolutions,\nadded in quadrature:\nq\n\n2\n\u03c3SEM\n+ (\u03b1\u03c3BP M )2 = 127 \u03bcm.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3SEM and \u03c3BP M are the intrinsic resolutions of the detectors, and \u03b1 =\n1.1 is a scale factor between the SEM and BPM which is taken from the slope\nof the line in Figure 7. This scale factor can result from either optics of the\ntransport line or miscalibrations between the SEM and BPM.\nIn order to separate the individual BPM and SEM resolutions, we select a\ndifferent time span of spills in which the beam position at the detectors was\n8\n\n\fFig. 8. Comparison of the reported beam position from the SEM and BPM during\na time period of 1329 spills when beam position is nearly constant.\n\nobserved to be consistent from spill to spill (to within <0.5mm). Figure 8 shows\na histogram of the beam positions, as measured in each of the detectors, for\none such interval of 1329 spills in which the beam motion was relatively small.\nThe RMS of the beam centroid positions spill-to-spill is a measure of both the\nbeam wandering and the device resolution, ie.\n\nRMSSEM =\nRMSBP M =\n\nq\n\n2\n2\n\u03c3SEM\n+ \u03c3wander\n= 97.8\u03bcm\n\n(2)\n\nq\n\n2\n(\u03b1\u03c3BP M )2 + \u03c3wander\n= 129.1\u03bcm\n\nwhere \u03c3wander is a measure of the RMS variation of the beam motion spillto-spill due to variations in the beamline performance, \u03c3BP M is the intrinsic\nresolutions of the BPM, \u03c3SEM is the intrinsic resolutions of the SEM, and\n\u03b1 is the scale factor to account for differences between the SEM and BPM\ncalibrations. The quantity \u03c3wander is not a priori known and varies from time\ninterval to time interval but it should be the same for both devices because of\ntheir proximity. As may be seen in Figure 8, the BPM spread is larger than\nthe SEM spread, suggesting \u03c3SEM < \u03c3BP M . 1\nCombining the expressions in Equation 1 and Equation 2, and using \u03b1 = 1.1\nfor the scale factor between BPM and SEM positions, we may obtain:\n\u03c3SEM = 67 \u00b1 5\u03bcm\n\u03c3BP M = 98 \u00b1 5\u03bcm\n1\n\nIn fact, we selected over 20 such time spans of relatively stable beam and found\nthat the spill-to-spill variation reported by the BPM was greater than that reported\nby the SEM.\n\n9\n\n\fWe have repeated this analysis of the vertical beam data for several time\nintervals. The resolutions are observed to vary by an RMS of 5 \u03bcm, with the\nvariation possibly due to beam-related effects or variation in resolution across\nthe aperture of the SEM or BPM.\nIn the horizontal view the presence of the focusing quadrupoles 870A and\n870B, as well as the trim magnet HT870, complicates direct comparison of the\nbeam position reported by the prototype SEM and the nearby horizontal BPM\nlabelled HP870. Furthermore, the beam width varied between 7.4 mm and 8.2\nmm, and was correlated with two different beam intensities. The expected\nSEM centroid resolution is quite different for those two beam widths, so we\nsplit data into two sets. We looked at 32 intervals with 1000 spills each. We\nassumed that the resolution for the horizontal BPM HP870 is the same as\nfor the identically-constructed vertical BPM VP871. In each time interval we\ncould find beam wandering (\u03c3wander ) from the BPM measurements and then\nplug that into SEM data and find \u03c3SEM . As a result we find:\n\u03c3SEM (\u03c3x = 7.4mm) = 151 \u00b1 5\u03bcm\n\u03c3SEM (\u03c3x = 8.2mm) = 171 \u00b1 5\u03bcm\n\n6\n\nExpected SEM Resolution\n\nThe previous section measured the centroid resolution at three different beam\nwidths. A less reliable estimate was also made of the beam width resolution\n(see below). The beam centroid and width resolutions of a SEM grid are\naffected by several instrumental factors[18]:\n\u2022 The signal noise on each individual SEM strip (\u03b4yi ).\n\u2022 The non-uniformity in strip spacing (\u03b4xi )\n\u2022 The number of SEM strips per beam \u03c3\nThe first effect listed above smears\nq the pulse height yi observed on an individual strip i by an amount \u03b4yi = \u03b4 2 + (\u03b5yi )2 , where \u03b4 is a presumed constant\npulse height resolution and \u03b5 describes a signal size-dependent resolution. The\nsecond effect, which arises due to the fact that the foil strips are not perfectly\npositioned on the grid, causes a smearing of the actual position xi of the strips.\nThis form of strip placement error we accounted for by assuming an additional\nuncertainty of the strip pulse heights of \u03b4yi = f \u2032 (x) * \u03b4xi where f \u2032 (x) is the\nderivative of the gaussian fitting function that we use to describe the beam\nprofile and \u03b4xi is the uncertainty in the strip positions.\nWe fit our beam test data to a model of expected beam centroid resolution\nwhich incorporates the above effects. We simulated beam spills in a 44-channel\n10\n\n\fFig. 9. Comparison of the measured resolution of the centroid position from this\nbeam test to a calculation based on simulated data for different beam widths. The\nquantity \u03b4x is the amount by which the foil strips are misplaced on the grid. Constant intensity is assumed in the calculation.\n\ndetector whose signals were smeared to account for electronics noise and foil\nstrip misalignments. Such simulated data was generated for different beam\nwidths, and for different assumptions on the electronics noise and strip misalignments. By comparing to our data, we could in effect measure the electronics noise.\nOur test beam data is overlaid with the corresponding calculations in Figure 9\nand 10. As can be seen, we anticipate smaller centroid and width resolutions\nfor narrower beams, until the beam width \u03c3beam = 1.0 mm, which corresponds\nto the strip-to-strip spacing for our SEM. As the beam becomes narrower, the\ncentroid and width resolutions are more sensitive to the placement accuracy\n\u03b4xi of the strips in the SEM grid. Our calculation is performed for three\ndifferent accuracies, \u03b4xi = 10, 50, and 100 \u03bcm. We expect \u03b4xi = 50 \u03bcm for\nthe prototype and \u03b4xi = 10 \u03bcm will be achieved for the final NuMI SEM's.\nFigure 9 indicates a centroid resolution of order 20-30 \u03bcm may be anticipated\nin the NuMI beam line, where the beam width \u03c3beam is about 1.0 mm.\n11\n\n\fFig. 10. Comparison of the measured resolution of the beam width from this beam\ntest to a calculation based on simulated data for different beam widths. The quantity\n\u03b4x is the amount by which the foil strips are misplaced on the grid. Constant\nintensity is assumed in the calculation.\n\nWe have also tried to understand the expected resolution of the beam width\nmeasured by the SEM grid. Figure 10 shows the expected resolution of the\nbeam width as a function of the beam width. Overlaid on the plot in Figure 10\nare two points derived from the MiniBooNE test beam run which are the\nvariation of the width in the vertical plane as observed over two ranges of\nbeam spills. A similar procedure was not possible in the horizontal, as the\nbeam width was observed to vary dramatically at high beam intensity to to\nemittance variation from the 8 GeV Booster accelerator, an effect confirmed\nby other instrumentation in the transport line.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the prototype data we observe that the beam centroid resolution of\nthe 1 mm pitch SEM prototype is around 64 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm for the beam with\n12\n\n\f\u03c3 = 3.5 mm. From the extrapolation in Figure 9 to beam widths relevant\nfor NuMI, we anticipate a centroid resolution of 20-25 \u03bcm for a 1 mm beam.\nAlthough the beam intensity will be a factor of 5 larger in the NuMI beam,\nwhich might be expected to improve the SEM resolution due to increased\nsignal size, this signal increase will be compensated by a signal decrease arising\nfrom the narrower foil strip size in the NuMI SEM's. Thus, the extrapolation\nshown in Figures 9 and 10 should be approximately correct.\nThe two SEM's just upstream of the NuMI target will have finer pitch than the\nprototype SEM (0.5 mm compared to 1.0 mm), and also wider strips (0.25mm\nas compared to the 0.15mm of the transport line SEM's). One therefore expects\nthat (a) the mechanical assembly details of the 0.5mm SEM's shall not be as\ncritical, since the beam size will be larger than the strip spacing, and (b) the\npulse height smearing will not as greatly affect their resolutions because the\nwider strips will yield a 1.7 times greater signal. The results of the present\nstudy suggest that these 0.5 mm SEM's should behave in a 1.0 mm beam\nmuch like the 1.0 mm prototype performance for a 2.0 mm beam. That is,\nan approximate scaling relation should exist between the strip pitch and the\nbeam width.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Gianfranco Ferioli of CERN for extensive advice and consultation\non segmented SEM's and for sharing his designs, upon which the present\nprototype is based.
