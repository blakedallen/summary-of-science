Coalescing neutron\nstar binaries are considered among the strongest and\nmost likely sources of gravitational waves to be seen by\nVIRGO/LIGO interferometers [1, 2]. Due to the emission of gravitational radiation, binary neutron stars decrease their orbital separation and finally merge. Gravitational waves emitted during the last few orbits of inspiral could yield important informations about the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter [3, 4, 5, 6]. With\naccurate templates of gravitational waves from coalescing binary compact stars, it may be possible to extract\ninformation about physics of neutron stars from signals\nobserved by the interferometers and to solve one of the\ncentral but also most complex problem of physics - the\nproblem of the absolute ground state of matter at high\ndensities. It is still an open question whether the core of\na neutron star consists mainly of superfluid neutrons or\nexotic matter like strange quark matter, pions or kaons\ncondensates (see e.g. Ref. [7] for a recent review). The\npossibility of the existence of quark matter dates back\nto the early seventies. Bodmer [8] remarked that matter consisting of deconfined up, down and strange quarks\ncould be the absolute ground state of matter at zero pressure and temperature. If this is true then objects made\n\n\u2217 Francois.Limousin@obspm.fr\n\u2020 Dorota.Gondek@obspm.fr\n\u2021 Eric.Gourgoulhon@obspm.fr\n\nof such matter, the so-called strange stars, could exist\n[9, 10, 11]. Strange quark stars are currently considered\nas a possible alternative to neutron stars as compact objects (see e.g. [12, 13, 14] and references therein).\nThe evolution of a binary system of compact objects\nis entirely driven by gravitational radiation and can be\nroughly divided into three phases : point-like inspiral, hydrodynamical inspiral and merger. The first phase corresponds to large orbital separation (much larger than the\nneutron star radius) and can be treated analytically using\nthe post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to general relativity (see Ref. [15] for a review). In the second phase the\norbital separation becomes only a few times larger than\nthe radius of the star, so the effects of tidal deformation,\nfinite size and hydrodynamics play an important role. In\nthis phase, since the shrinking time of the orbital radius\ndue to the emission of gravitational waves is still larger\nthan the orbital period, it is possible to approximate the\nstate as quasi-equilibrium [16, 17]. The final phase of the\nevolution is the merger of the two objects, which occur\ndynamically [18, 19, 20, 21]. Note that quasi-equilibrium\ncomputations from the second phase provide valuable initial data for the merger [5, 18, 20, 22].\nAlmost all studies of the final phase of the inspiral\nof close binary neutron star systems employ a simplified EOS of dense matter, namely a polytropic EOS\n[3, 4, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. There are only two\nexceptions: (i) Oechslin et al. have used a pure nuclear\nmatter EOS, based on a relativistic mean field model and\na 'hybrid' EOS with a phase transition to quark matter at high density [5]; (ii) Bejger et al. have computed\nquasi-equilibrium sequences based on three nuclear mat-\n\n\f2\nter EOS [6]. In this article we present results on the hydrodynamical phase of inspiraling binary strange quark\nstars described by MIT bag model. The calculations are\nperformed in the framework of Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews\napproximation to general relativity (see Ref. [29] for a\nreview). We consider binary systems consisting of two\nidentical stars. We choose the gravitational mass of each\nstar to be 1.35 M\u2299 in infinite separation in order to be\nconsistent with recent population synthesis calculations\n[30] and with the current set of well-measured neutron\nstar masses in relativistic binary radio pulsars [31, 32].\nWe compare the evolution of a strange star binary system\nwith a neutron star binary in order to find any characteristic features in the gravitational waveform that will help\nto distinguish between strange stars and neutron stars.\nWe consider two limiting cases of velocity flow in stellar\ninterior: the irrotational and the synchronized case in order to exhibit the differences between these two extreme\nstates. The irrotational case is more realistic since the\nviscosity of neutron star matter (or strange star matter)\nis far too low to ensure synchronization during the late\nstage of the inspiral [33, 34]. Due to the finite density\nat the surface of bare strange stars, we had to introduce\na treatment of the boundary condition for the velocity\npotential (in the irrotational case) different from that of\nneutron stars, where the density vanishes at the stellar\nsurface.\nThe paper is organized in the following way: Sec. II\nis a brief summary of the assumptions upon which this\nwork is based, Sec. III is devoted to the description of the\nEOS used to describe strange stars and neutron stars. In\nSec. IV we briefly describe the basic equations for quasiequilibrium and derive the boundary condition required\nfor solving the fluid equation of irrotational flow with finite surface density, which is relevant for strange stars.\nIn Sec. V we present the numerical results for corotating\nand irrotational strange stars binaries and compare their\nquasistationary evolution with that of neutron stars, as\nwell as with that of post-Newtonian point-masses. Section VI contains the final discussion. Throughout the\npaper, we use geometrized units, for which G = c = 1,\nwhere G and c denote the gravitational constant and\nspeed of light respectively.\nII.\n\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe first assumption regards the matter stress-energy\ntensor T , which we assume to have the perfect fluid\nform:\nT = (e + p)u \u2297 u + p g,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere e, p, u and g are respectively the fluid proper\nenergy density, the fluid pressure, the fluid 4-velocity, and\nthe spacetime metric. This is a very good approximation\nfor neutron star matter or strange star matter.\nThe last orbits of inspiraling binary compact stars\ncan be studied in the quasi-equilibrium approximation.\n\nUnder this assumption the evolution of a system is approximated by a sequence of exactly circular orbits. This\nassumption results from the fact that the time evolution\nof an orbit is still much larger than the orbital period\nand that the gravitational radiation circularizes an orbit\nof a binary system. This implies a continuous spacetime\nsymmetry, called helical symmetry [35, 36] represented\nby the Killing vector:\nl=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u03a9 ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the orbital angular velocity and \u2202/\u2202t and\n\u2202/\u2202\u03c6 are the natural frame vectors associated with the\ntime coordinate t and the azimuthal coordinate \u03c6 of an\nasymptotic inertial observer.\nOne can then introduce the shift vector B of coorbiting coordinates by means of the orthogonal decomposition of l with respect to the \u03a3t foliation of the standard 3+1 formalism:\nl = N n \u2212 B,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n is the unit future directed vector normal to \u03a3t ,\nN is called the lapse function and n * B = 0.\nWe also assume that the spatial part of the metric\n(i.e. the metric induced by g on each hypersurface \u03a3t )\nis conformally flat, which corresponds to the IsenbergWilson-Mathews (IWM) approximation to general relativity [37, 38, 39] (see Ref. [36] for a discussion). Thanks\nto this approximation we have to solve only five of the\nten Einstein equations. In the IWM approximation, the\nspacetime metric takes the form:\nds2 = \u2212(N 2 \u2212 Bi B i )dt2 \u2212 2Bi dt dxi + A2 fij dxi dxj , (4)\nwhere A is some conformal factor, fij the flat spatial\nmetric and Latin indices run in {1, 2, 3} (spatial indices).\nThe comparison between the IWM results presented here\nand the non-conformally flat ones will be performed in a\nfuture article [40].\nThe fourth assumption concerns the fluid motion inside each star. We consider two limiting cases: synchronized (also called corotating) motion and irrotational\nflow (assuming that the fluid has zero vorticity in the\ninertial frame). The latter state is more realistic.\nWe consider only equal-mass binaries consisting of\nidentical stars with gravitational masses M1 = M2 =\n1.35 M\u2299 measured in infinite separation. The main reason for choosing these particular masses is that five out of\nsix observed binary radio pulsars have mass ratio close to\nunity and gravitational masses of each star \u223c 1.3\u22121.4M\u2299\n[31, 32]. In addition population synthesis calculations\n[30] have shown that a significant fraction of the observed\nbinary neutron stars in gravitational waves will contain\nstars with equal masses \u223c 1.4 M\u2299 and systems consisting\nof a low and a high mass neutron star.\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\nM [Msol]\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nR [km]\nFIG. 1: Gravitational mass M versus areal radius R for sequences of static strange quark stars described by the simplest MIT bag model (solid line) and neutron stars described\nby polytropic EOS with \u03b3 = 2.5 and \u03ba = 0.0093 m0 n1.5\nnuc\n(dashed line). The two sequences are crossing at the point\nM = 1.35 M\u2299 and R = 10.677 km (marked by a circle).\n\nIII.\n\nIt has been shown [3, 4] that the evolution of equalmass binary neutron stars depend mainly on the compactness parameter M/R, where M and R are the gravitational mass measured by an observer at infinity for a\nsingle isolated neutron star and the stellar radius respectively. It is therefore interesting to check if the properties\nof inspiraling strange stars can be predicted by studying\nbinaries consisting of polytropic neutron stars having the\nsame mass and the same compactness parameter. Therefore we perform calculations for two different equations\nof state of dense matter: a strange quark matter EOS\nand a polytropic EOS.\nTypically, strange stars are modeled [10, 11] with an\nequation of state based on the MIT-bag model of quark\nmatter, in which quark confinement is described by an\nenergy term proportional to the volume [41]. The equation of state is given by the simple formula\n\n\u0014\n\n1+a p\nn(p) = n0 * 1 +\na \u03c10\n\n(5)\n\u00151/(1+a)\n\n,\n\np = \u03ban\u03b3 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03ba and \u03b3 coefficients are some constant numbers:\n\u03ba represents the overall compressibility of matter while\n\u03b3 measures the stiffness of the EOS. The total energy\ndensity is related to the baryon density by\n\nTHE EQUATION OF STATE AND\nSTELLAR MODELS\n\np = a(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 ),\n\nIt was shown that different strange quark models can be\napproximated very well by Eqs (5) and (6) [42, 43].\nIn the numerical calculations reported in the present\npaper we describe strange quark matter using the simplest MIT bag model (with massless and non-interacting\nquarks), for which the formula (5) is exact. We choose the\nvalue of the bag constant to be B = 60 MeV fm\u22123 . For\nthis model we have a = 1/3, \u03c10 = 4.2785 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123\nand n0 = 0.28665 fm\u22123 . In general for the MIT bag\nmodel the density of strange quark matter at zero pressure is in the range \u223c 3 \u00d7 1014 \u2212 6.5 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 and\na between 0.289 and 1/3 (for 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0.6 and 0 \u2264 ms \u2264\n250 MeV) [43]. The higher value of a and of \u03c10 the higher\ncompactness parameter of a star with fixed gravitational\nmass.\nUp to now, the majority of calculations of the hydrodynamical inspiral phase [3, 4, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]\nand all calculations of the merger phase [18, 19, 20, 21]\nhave been performed for binary systems containing neutron stars described by a polytropic EOS:\n\n(6)\n\nwhere n is the baryon density and a, \u03c10 , n0 are some\nconstants depending on the 3 parameters of the model\n(the bag constant B, the mass of the strange quarks ms\nand the strenght of the QCD coupling constant \u03b1). In\ngeneral this equation corresponds to a self-bound matter\nwith mass density \u03c10 and baryon density\n\u221a n0 at zero pressure and with a fixed sound velocity ( a) at all pressures.\n\ne(n) =\n\n\u03ba\nn \u03b3 + \u03bc0 n ,\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the chemical potential at zero pressure.\nIn order to compare results for strange stars with those\nfor neutron stars, we determine the values of \u03ba and \u03b3\nwhich yield to the same radius for the gravitational mass\nM = 1.35 M\u2299 as that obtained for a static strange star.\nIt was shown [6] that the properties of inspiraling neutron stars described by realistic EOS can be, in a good\napproximation, predicted by studying binaries with assumed polytropic EOSs with \u03b3 = 2 or 2.5. For a 1.35\nM\u2299 strange star we have a high value of compactness\nparameter M/R = 0.1867 so we have choosen \u03b3 = 2.5,\nfor which we found \u03ba = 0.00937 m0 n1.5\nnuc , with the rest\nmass of relativistic particles m0 := 1.66 \u00d7 10\u221227 kg and\nnnuc = 0.1 fm\u22123 .\nIn Fig. 1 we present the mass-radius relation for a sequence of static stars described by the simplest MIT bag\nmodel (solid line) and the polytropic EOS (dashed line)\nparametrized by central density. For small mass strange\nstars M \u223c R3 since density is almost constant inside\na star \u223c \u03c10 . In the top panel of Fig. 2 we show the\nmass density distribution inside the strange star (solid\nline) and the neutron star described by polytropic EOS\n(dashed line) having gravitational mass 1.35 M\u2299 and\nareal radius 10.667 km (the configurations corresponding to the crossing point on Fig. 1). The huge density\njump at the surface of the strange star corresponds to\n\u03c10 = 4B. The value of density at the surface describes\nstrongly or weakly bound strange matter, which in each\ncase must be absolutely stable with respect to 56 Fe.\n\n\f4\nof strange stars are very large and for \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c10 we have\n\u03b3 = a + \u03c1/(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 ) \u2192 \u221e. The EOS of neutron stars\nfor densities lower than \u223c 1014 g cm\u22123 (the crust) is well\nestablished [7]. In the outer crust of an ordinary neutron\nstar the pressure is dominated by the ultra-relativistic\nelectron gas, so we have \u03b3 = 4/3. The values of the local\nadiabatic index in the inner crust of a neutron star depends strongly on density and varies from \u03b3 \u2243 0.5 near\nthe neutron drip point to \u03b3 \u2243 1.6 in the bottom layers\nnear the crust-core interface.\nIn our calculations we use equation of state in the form:\n\n14\n\n14\n\n-3\n\n\u03c1 [10 g cm ]\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\nn = n(H),\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nr [km]\n\np = p(H),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere H is pseudo-enthalpy (the log-enthalpy) defined\nby:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne+p\nH(n) := ln\n,\n(11)\nnE0\nwhere the energy per unit baryon number is E0 = m0\nfor a polytropic EOS, and E0 = \u03c10 /n0 = 837.26 MeV for\nstrange quark model described above.

The vertical dotted line\ncorresponds to the stellar surface.\n\nAn important quantity relevant for evolution of binary\ncompact stars is the adiabatic index:\n\u03b3 = d ln p/d ln n.\n\n(9)\n\nWe assume that matter is catalized so the adiabatic index can be calculated directly from EOS (see Refs. [44]\nand [45] for discussion on different kind of adiabatic indices and corresponding timescales). Note that for the\npolytropic EOS given by Eq. (7) the index \u03b3 coincides\nwith the adiabatic index of a relativistic isentropic fluid.\nDependence of the adiabatic index \u03b3 on stellar radii for\nboth EOS is shown in the bottom pannel of Fig. 2. The\nadiabatic index of strange matter is qualitatively different from the adiabatic index for polytropic EOS or\nfor realistic EOS.

[46] for the derivation of\nthe equations describing quasi-equilibrium binary stars\nwithin the IWM approximation to general relativity. After recalling these equations, we mainly concentrate on\nthe equation for the velocity potential of irrotational\nflows. Actually this equation has a different structure for\nstrange stars than for neutron stars. This results from\nthe non-vanishing of the density at the stellar surfaces of\nstrange stars (cf. the top panel in Fig. 2).\nA.\n\nThe gravitational field equations\n\nThe gravitational field equations have been obtained\nwithin the 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein's equations [47, 48], taking into account the helical symmetry\nof spacetime. The trace of the spatial part of the Einstein\nequations combined with the Hamiltonian constraint results in two equations:\ni\n\n\u2206\u03bd = 4\u03c0A2 (E + S) + A2 Kij K ij \u2212 \u2207i \u03bd\u2207 \u03b2, (13)\n3\n\u2206\u03b2 = 4\u03c0A2 S + A2 Kij K ij\n4\n1\ni\ni\n\u2212 (\u2207i \u03bd\u2207 \u03bd + \u2207i \u03b2\u2207 \u03b2),\n(14)\n2\nwhere \u2207i stands for the covariant derivative associated\ni\nwith the flat 3-metric fij and \u2206 := \u2207 \u2207i for the associated Laplacian operator. The quantities \u03bd and \u03b2 are\n\n\f5\ndefined by \u03bd := ln N and \u03b2 := ln(AN ), and Kij denotes\nthe extrinsic curvature tensor of the t = const hypersurfaces. E and S are respectively the matter energy density\nand the trace of the stress tensor, both as measured by\nthe observer whose 4-velocity is n\u03bc (Eulerian observer):\nE := T\u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc n\u03bd ,\n2 ij\n\nS := A f Tij .\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nIn addition, we have also to solve the momentum constraint, which writes\n1 i\n\u2206N i + \u2207 (\u2207j N j ) = \u221216\u03c0N A2 (E + p)U i\n3\n+2N A2 K ij \u2207j (3\u03b2 \u2212 4\u03bd),(17)\n\nwhere N i := B i + \u03a9(\u2202/\u2202\u03c6)i denotes the shift vector of\nnonrotating coordinates, and U i is the fluid 3-velocity.\nB.\n\nApart from the gravitational field equations, we have\nto solve the fluid equations. The equations governing the\nquasi-equilibrium state are the relativistic Euler equation\nand the equation of baryon number conservation. Both\ncases of irrotational and synchronized motions admit a\nfirst integral of the relativistic Euler equation:\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03930 is the Lorentz factor between the co-orbiting\nobserver and the Eulerian observer and \u0393 is the Lorentz\nfactor between the fluid and the co-orbiting observers\n(\u0393 = 1 for synchronized binaries).\nFor a synchronized motion, the equation of baryon\nnumber conservation is trivially satisfied, whereas for an\nirrotational flow, it is written as\ni\n\n\u03b6H\u2206\u03a8 + \u2207 H\u2207i \u03a8\n= A2 h\u0393n U0i \u2207i H + \u03b6H\ni\n\n\u00d7[\u2207 \u03a8\u2207i (H \u2212 \u03b2) + A2 hU0i \u2207i \u0393n ], (19)\n\nwhere \u03a8 is the velocity potential, h := exp(H), \u03b6 the\nthermodynamical coefficient:\nd ln H\n\u03b6 :=\n,\n(20)\nd ln n\nand \u0393n denotes the Lorentz factor between the fluid and\nthe Eulerian observer and U0i is the orbital 3-velocity with\nrespect to the Eulerian observers:\nU0i\n\nBi\n=\u2212 .\nN\n\n(21)\n\nThe fluid 3-velocity U i with respect to the Eulerian\nobserver is equal to U0i for synchronized binary systems,\nwhereas\n1\ni\nUi = 2\n\u2207\u03a8\n(22)\nA \u0393n h\nfor irrotational ones.\n\nBoundary condition for the velocity potential\n\nThe method of solving the elliptic equation (19) for\nthe velocity potential is different for neutron stars and\nstrange stars. In the case of neutron stars, the coefficient\n\u03b6H in front of the Laplacian vanishes at the surface of\nthe star so Eq. (19) is not merely a Poisson type equation\nfor \u03a8. It therefore deserves a special treatment (see Appendix B in [26] for a discussion). In the case of strange\nstars, the coefficient \u03b6H = 1/3 in whole star so we have\nto deal with a usual Poisson equation and consequently\nwe have to impose a boundary condition for the velocity\npotential at the stellar surface.\nWe can define the surface of the star by n|surf = n0 =\nconstant. The surface of the fluid ball is obviously Liedragged along the fluid 4-velocity vector u, so that this\nlast condition gives\n(\u00a3u n)|surf = 0,\n\nThe fluid equations\n\nH + \u03bd \u2212 ln \u03930 + ln \u0393 = const.,\n\nC.\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u00a3u is the Lie derivative along the vector field u.\nLet us decompose u in a part along the helical Killing\nvector l and a part S parrallel to the hypersurface \u03a3t :\nu = \u03bb(l + S).\n\n(24)\n\nThe condition (23) is then equivalent to\n\u03bb(\u00a3l n + \u00a3S n)|surf = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nNow, if the fluid flows obeys to the helical symmetry\n\u00a3l n = 0; inserting this relation into Eq. (25) leads to\n(\u00a3S n)|surf = 0 or equivalently (since S is a spatial vector):\n(S i \u2207i n)\n\nsurf\n\n= 0.\n\n(26)\n\nNow, let us express S in terms of the spatial vectors U\nand B. First, Eq. (24) implies n * u = \u03bbn * l. Secondly,\nthe fluid motion u can be described by the orthogonal\ndecomposition u = \u0393n (n + U ) which yields n * u = \u2212\u0393n .\nFinally, from Eq. (3), we have n * l = \u2212N so that the\nfactor \u03bb can be expressed as \u03bb = \u0393n /N and Eq. (24)\nbecomes\nu=\n\n\u0393n\n(l + S).\nN\n\n(27)\n\nNow, combining Eq. (27) and Eq. (3), we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nu = \u0393n n + (S \u2212 B) .\nN\n\n(28)\n\nComparing with the orthogonal decomposition u =\n\u0393n (n + U ), we deduce that S = N U + B. Inserting this\nrelation into Eq. (26) leads to the boundary condition\n(N U i \u2207i n + B i \u2207i n)\n\nsurf\n\n= 0.\n\n(29)\n\nNow, using Eq. (22), we obtain a Neumann-like boundary condition for \u03a8:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393n hA2 i\ni\nB \u2207i n\n(\u2207 n\u2207i \u03a8)\n=\u2212\n.\n(30)\nN\nsurf\nsurf\n\n\f6\nConsidering the elliptic equation (19) for \u03a8 we see that\nthe boundary condition we have obtained is consistent\nwith the case n = 0 (or equivalently \u03b6H = 0) at the\ni\ni\nstellar surface since, from Eq. (20), \u2207 H = \u03b6H\nn \u2207 n.\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\nA.\n\nThe method\n\nThe resolution of the above nonlinear elliptic equations is performed thanks to a numerical code based on\nmultidomain spectral methods and constructed upon the\nLorene C++ library [51]. The detailed description of\nthe whole algorithm, as well as numerous tests of the\ncode can be found in [46]. Additional tests have been\npresented in Sec. 3 of [4]. The code has already been\nused successfully for calculating the final phase of inspiral of binary neutron stars described by polytropic EOS\n[4, 17, 27, 49, 50] and realistic EOS [6]. It is worth\nto stress that the adaptation of the domains (numerical\ngrids) to the stellar surface (surface-fitted coordinates)\nused in this code is particulary usefull here, due to the\nstrong discontinuity of the density field at the surface of\nstrange stars (cf. the top panel in Fig. 2). Adapting\nthe grids to the stellar surface allows to avoid the severe\nGibbs phenomenon that such a discontinuity would necessary generate when performing polynomial expansions\nof the fields [52].\nThe hydrodynamical part of the code has been\namended for the present purpose, namely to solve\nEq. (19) for the velocity potential \u03a8 subject to the\nboundary condition (30). Let us recall that in the original version of the code, the treatment of Eq. (19) was\ndifferent due to the vanishing of the density field at the\nstellar surface (see Appendix B of Ref. [46]).\nWe have used one numerical domain for each star and\n3 (resp. 4) domains for the space around them for a small\n(resp. large) separation. In each domain, the number of\ncollocation points of the spectral method is chosen to be\nNr \u00d7N\u03b8 \u00d7N\u03c6 = 25\u00d717\u00d716, where Nr , N\u03b8 , and N\u03c6 denote\nthe number of collocation points (= number of polynomials used in the spectral method) in the radial, polar,\nand azimuthal directions respectively. The accuracy of\nthe computed relativistic models has been estimated using a relativistic generalization of the virial theorem [36]\n(see also Sec. III.A of Ref. [4]). The virial relative error\nis a few times 10\u22125 for the closest configurations.\n\nB.\n\nEvolutionary sequences\n\nFor each EOS we construct an evolutionary sequence,\ni.e. a sequence of quasi-equilibrium configurations with\nfixed baryon mass and decreasing separation. Such a\nsequence is expected to approximate pretty well the true\nevolution of binary neutron stars, which is entirely driven\n\n-0.02\n\nEbind [Msol]\n\nV.\n\nSQS MIT\nPolytrope \u03b3 =2.5\n3PN (Blanchet 2002)\n\n-0.025\n\n-0.03\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nfGW[Hz]\nFIG. 3: Binding energy as a function of gravitational wave\nfrequency along evolutionary sequences of corotating binaries.

The evolution of inspiraling corotating (irrotational) binaries is\nshown in Fig. 3 (Fig. 4). Fig. 3 and upper panel of\nFig. 4 show the binding energy Ebind versus frequency of\ngravitational waves fGW and lower panel of Fig. 4 show\nthe total angular momentum of the systems as a function\nof fGW . The binding energy is defined as the difference\nbetween the actual ADM mass of the system, MADM ,\nand the ADM mass at infinite separation (2.7 M\u2299 in our\ncase). The frequency of gravitational waves is twice the\norbital frequency, since it corresponds to the frequency of\nthe dominant part l = 2, m = \u00b12. Solid and dashed lines\ndenote quasi-equilibrium sequences of strange quark stars\nbinaries and neutron stars binaries respectively. Dotted\nlines in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 correspond to the 3rd PN\napproximation for point masses derived by [53]. Finally\nin Fig. 7 we compare our results with third order postNewtonian results for point-mass particles obtained in\nthe effective one body approach by Damour et al. 2000\n[54], Damour et al. 2002 [55] and in the standard nonresummed post-Newtonian framework by Blanchet 2002\n[53].\nA turning point of Ebind along an evolutionary sequence indicates an orbital instability [36]. This instability originates both from relativistic effects (the wellknown r = 6M last stable orbit of Schwarzschild metric)\nand hydrodynamical effects (for instance, such an instability exists for sufficiently stiff EOS in the Newtonian\n\n\f7\n\n-0.036\n\n-0.038\n\n-0.04\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nIrrotational binaries\n\nIn Fig. 4 we present the evolution of the binding energy and angular momentum for irrotational sequences\nof binary neutron stars and strange stars. We also verify\nthat these sequences are in a good agreement with PN\ncalculations for large separations.\nWe note important differences in the evolution of binary systems consisting of strange stars or neutron stars.\nThe strange star sequence shows a minimum of the binding energy at fGW \u2243 1390 Hz, which locates a dynamical\ninstability [36] and thus defines the ISCO. The minimum\nof Ebind coincides with the minimum of total angular\nmomentum J.

For both sequences we find a minimum of the\nbinding energy. In the present rotation state, this locates a secular instability [36]. The important difference\nbetween neutron stars and strange stars is the frequency\nat which this instability appears. Indeed, there is a difference of more than 100 Hz: 1020 Hz for strange stars\nand 1140 Hz for neutron stars. The binding energy is\nthe total energy of gravitational waves emitted by the\nsystem: a corotating binary strange star system emits\nless energy in gravitational waves and loses less angular\nmomentum before the ISCO than a binary neutron star\none with the same mass and compaction parameter in\ninfinite separation.\nComparison of our numerical results with 3rd order\nPN calculations reveals a good agreement for small frequencies (large separations) (see Fig. 3 and 7). The\ndeviation from PN curves at higher frequencies (smaller\nseparation) is due to hydrodynamical effects, which are\nnot taken into account in the PN approach.\n\nD.\n\nSQS MIT\nPolytrope \u03b3 = 2.5\n3PN (Blanchet 2002)\n\n-0.034\n\nJ / M0 [G/c]\n\nC.\n\n-0.032\n\nEbind [Msol]\n\nregime, see e.g. [49] and references therein). It is secular\nfor synchronized systems and dynamical for irrotational\nones.\nIn the case where no turning point of Ebind occurs\nalong the sequence, the mass-shedding limit (Roche lobe\noverflow) marks the end of the inspiral phase of the\nbinary system, since recent dynamical calculations for\n\u03b3 = 2 polytrope have shown that the time to coalescence\nwas shorter than one orbital period for configurations at\nthe mass-shedding limit [19, 28]. Thus the physical inspiral of binary compact stars terminates by either the\norbital instability (turning point of Ebind ) or the massshedding limit. In both cases, this defines the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The orbital frequency\nat the ISCO is a potentially observable parameter by the\ngravitational wave detectors, and thus a very interesting\nquantity.\n\n0.88\n\n0.86\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\nfGW [Hz]\nFIG. 4: Binding energy (top panel) and angular momentum\n(bottom panel) as a function of gravitational wave frequency\nalong evolutionary sequences of irrotational binaries.

Although the crust of a 1.35 M\u2299 neutron\nstar contains only a few percent of the stellar mass, this\nregion is easily deformed under the action of the tidal\nforces resulting from the gravitational field produced by\nthe companion star. The end of inspiral phase of binary\nstars strongly depends on the stiffness of matter in this\nregion. It has been shown that the turning-point orbital\ninstability for irrotational polytropic neutron stars binaries can be found only if \u03b3 \u2265 2.5 and if the compaction\nparameter is smaller than certain value ([4], [25]). In fact,\nas shown in Fig. 31 of paper [4], they didn't find ISCO for\nirrotational binary neutron stars with \u03b3 = 2.5 or \u03b3 = 3\nfor compaction parameter as high as M/R = 0.187.\nIn Fig. 6 we present the evolution of two different stellar radii: the equatorial radius Rx , defined as half the\ndiameter in the direction of the companion and the po-\n\nlar radius, defined as half the diameter parallel to the\nrotation axis. For spherical stars Rx = Rz . We see\nthat at the end of the inspiral phase, neutron stars are,\nfor the same separation, more oblate (more deformed)\nthan strange stars. Binary neutron stars reach the massshedding limit (the point at which they start to exchange\nmatter - a cusp form at the stellar surface in the direction\nof the companion) at coordinate separation d \u223c 25km.\nWe don't see any cusps for strange stars even for distances slightly smaller that the distance corresponding\nto the ISCO \u223c 23.5 km.\nIt is worth to remind here the results on rapidly rotating strange stars and neutron stars. The Keplerian limit\nis obtained for higher oblatness (more deformed stars),\nmeasured for example by the ratio of polar and equatorial radius, in the case of strange stars than in the case\nof neutron stars [42, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60].\nThe differences in the evolution of binary (or rotating)\nstrange stars and neutron stars stem from the fact that\nstrange stars are principally bound by another force than\ngravitation: the strong interaction between quarks.\nAs already mentioned the frequency of gravitational\nwaves is one of potentially observable parameters by the\ngravitational wave detectors. We can see from Fig. 7 that\nthe 3rd PN approximations for point masses derived by\ndifferent authors are giving ISCO at very high frequencies of gravitational waves > 2 kHz. Since in the hydrodynamical phase of inspiral the effect of a finite size\nof the star (e.g. tidal forces) is very important we see\ndeviation of our numerical results from point-masses calculations. The frequency of gravitational waves at the\nISCO strongly depends on equation of state and the ro-\n\n\f9\ntational state. For irrotational equal mass (of 1.35 M\u2299\nat infinite separation) strange stars binaries described by\nthe simple MIT bag model this frequency is \u223c 1400Hz\nand for neutron stars binaries described by four different\nrealistic EOS it is between 800Hz and 1230Hz [5, 6].\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have computed evolutionary sequences of irrotational and corotating binary strange stars by keeping the\nbaryon mass constant to a value that corresponds to individual gravitational masses of 1.35 M\u2299 at infinite separation. The last orbits of inspiraling binary strange stars\nhave been studied in the quasi-equilibrium approximation and in the framework of Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews\napproximation of general relativity. In order to calculate\nhydrodynamical phase of inspiraling irrotational strange\nstars binaries, i.e. assuming that the fluid has zero vorticity in the inertial frame, we found the boundary condition for the velocity potential. This boundary condition\nis valid for both the case of non-vanishing (e.g. self-bound\nmatter) and vanishing density at the stellar surface (neutron star matter). In our calculations strange stars are\nbuilt by strange quark matter described by the simplest\nMIT bag model (assuming massless and non-interacting\nquarks).\nWe have located the end of each quasi-equilibrium sequence (ISCO), which corresponds to some orbital instabilities (the dynamical instability for irrotational case or\nthe secular one for synchronized case) and determined the\nfrequency of gravitational waves at this point. This characteristic frequency yields important information about\nthe equation of state of compact stars and is one of the\npotentially observable parameters by the gravitational\nwave detectors. In addition, the obtained configurations\nprovide valuable initial conditions for the merger phase.\nWe found the frequency of gravitational waves at the\nISCO to be \u223c 1400 Hz for irrotational strange star binaries and \u223c 1000 Hz for synchronized case. The irrotational case is more realistic since the viscosity of strange\nstar matter is far too low to ensure synchronization during the late stage of the inspiral. For irrotational equal\nmass (of 1.35 M\u2299 ) neutron star binaries described by realistic EOS [5, 6] the frequency of gravitational waves\nat the ISCO is between 800Hz and 1230Hz, much lower\nthan for a binary strange quark star built of self-bound\nstrange quark matter. We have considered only strange\nquark stars described by the simple MIT bag model with\nmassless and non-interacting quarks. In order to be able\nto interpret future gravitational-wave observations correctly it is necessary to perform calculations for different\nstrange star EOS parameters (taking also into account\nthe existence of a thin crust) and for large sample of\nneutron stars described by realistic equations of state.\n\nFor some MIT bag model parameters one is able to obtain less compact stars than considered in the present\npaper. In this case the frequency of gravitational waves\nat the end of inspiral phase will be lower than obtained\nby us. It should be also taken into account that stars in\na binary system can have different masses [30]. The case\nof binary stars (with equal masses and different masses)\ndescribed by different strange quark matter models will\nbe presented in a separate paper [61].\nWe have shown the differences in the inspiral phase\nbetween strange quark stars and neutron stars described\nby polytropic equation of state having the same gravitational mass and radius in the infinite separation. It was\nalready shown by Bejger et al. 2005 [6] that the frequency\nof gravitational waves at the end point of inspiraling neutron stars described by several realistic EOS without exotic phases (such as meson condensates or quark matter)\ncan be predicted, in a good approximation, by studying\nbinaries with assumed polytropic EOSs with \u03b3 = 2 or 2.5.\nFor realistic EOS and polytropes with \u03b3 \u2264 2.5 [4, 25]\na quasi-equilibrium irrotational sequence terminates by\nmass-shedding limit (where a cusp on the stellar surface\ndevelops).\nWe found that it wasn't the case for inspiraling strange\nstar binaries which are self-bound objects having very\nlarge adiabatic index in the outer layer. For both synchronized and irrotational configurations, we could always find a turning point of binding energy along an\nevolutionary sequence of strange quark stars, which defines an orbital instability and thus marks the ISCO in\nthis case. In the irrotational case for the same separation\nstrange stars are less deformed than polytropic neutron\nstars and for the same ratio of coordinate radius Rx /Rz\ntheir surfaces are more smooth. A cusp doesn't appear\non the surface of a strange star in a binary system even\nfor separation corresponding to orbital instability. The\nfrequency of gravitational waves at the end of inspiral\nphase is higher by 300 Hz for the strange star binary system than for the polytropic neutron star binaries. The\ndifferences in the evolution of binary (or rotating) strange\nstars and neutron stars stem from the fact that strange\nstars are principally bound by an additional force, strong\ninteraction between quarks.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank our anonymous referee for helpful comments.\nPartially supported by the KBN grants 5P03D.017.21\nand PBZ-KBN-054/P03/2001; by \"Ayudas para movilidad de Profesores de Universidad e Invesigadores espanoles y extranjeros\" from the Spanish MEC; by the\n\"Bourses de recherche 2004 de la Ville de Paris\" and by\nthe Associated European Laboratory Astro-PF (Astrophysics Poland-France).\n\n\f10\n\n0\nSQS MIT irrot.\nSQS MIT corot.\nPolytrope \u03b3 = 2.5 irrot.\nPolytrope \u03b3 = 2.5 corot.\n3PN irrot.
