PANIN, A. STAVROVA, AND N.VAVILOV\n\n1. Artin's neighborhood\nIn this section we prove Theorem 3.2, Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.4 of [PaSV].\nThe following Bertini type theorem is an extension of Artin's result [A, Exp.XI,Thm.2.1].\nTheorem 1. Let k be an infinite field, and let V \u2282 Pnk be a locally closed sub-scheme of pure\ndimension r. Further, let V \u2032 \u2282 V be an open sub-scheme such that for each point x \u2208 V \u2032 the\nscheme V is k-smooth at x. Finally, let p1 , p2 , . . . , pm \u2208 Pnk be a family of pair-wise distinct closed\npoints. For a family H1 (d), H2 (d), . . . , Hs (d), with s \u2264 r, of hypersurfaces of degree d containing\nall points pi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, set Y = H1 (d) \u2229 H2 (d) \u2229 * * * \u2229 Hs (d).\nThen there exists an integer d depending on the family p1 , p2 , . . . , pm such that if the family\nH1 (d), H2 (d), . . . , Hs (d) with s \u2264 r is sufficiently general, then Y intersects V transversally at\neach point of Y \u2229 V \u2032 .\nIf, moreover, V is irreducible (respectively, geometrically irreducible) and s < r then for the\nsame integer d and for a sufficiently general family H1 (d), H2 (d), . . . , Hs (d) the intersection Y \u2229 V\nis irreducible (respectively, geometrically irreducible).\nProof.\n` Let k\u0304 be an algebraic closure of k. Given a k-scheme X, we will write X\u0304 for X \u2297k k\u0304. Let\np = pi , let p\u0304 be the corresponding scheme over k\u0304, and let qj (j = 1, 2, . . . , s) be all its closed\npoints.\nFirstly we prove the Theorem for the case of the field k\u0304, the k\u0304-schemes V\u0304 and V\u0304 \u2032 and the family\nof closed points qj (j = 1, 2, . . . , s). Given that we will be able to choose a sufficiently general\nhyperplanes H1 (d), H2 (d), . . . , Hs (d) of the same degree d which are defined over the field k such\nthat the family H\u03041 (d), H\u03042 (d), . . . , H\u0304s (d) solves our problem for the k\u0304-schemes V\u0304 and V\u0304 \u2032 and the\nfamily of closed points qj (j = 1, 2, . . . , s). Then, clearly, the family H1 (d), H2 (d), . . . , Hs (d) solves\n\u2032\nour problem for the\n` k-schemes V andnV and the family of points pn1 , p2 , . n. . , pm .\nNow set q := qi and let H \u2282 Pk\u0304 be a hyperplane. Let \u03c0 : P\u0303k\u0304 \u2192 Pk\u0304 be the blow up of Pnk\u0304\nat q and let E = \u03c0 \u22121 (q) be the exceptional divisor on P\u0303nk\u0304 . By [Ha, Ch.II, Sect.7, Prop.7.10] there\nexists an integer N >> 0 such that for each c > N the invertible sheaf O(cH \u2212 E) on \u03c0 : P\u0303nk\u0304 \u2192 Pnk\u0304\nis very ample relatively to Pnk\u0304 . Take such an integer c and set d = c + 1. It is easy to see that the\nsheaf O(dH \u2212 E) is very ample on P\u0303nk\u0304 . It follows that its global sections define a closed embedding\nP\u0303nk\u0304 \u0592\u2192 Prk\u0304 . One has\nH 0 (Prk\u0304 , O(1)) = H 0 (P\u0303nk\u0304 , O(dH \u2212 E))\n= H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , \u03c0\u2217 (O(dH \u2212 E)))\n= H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , \u03c0\u2217 (O(\u2212E)) \u2297 O(dH))\n= H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , I(d)),\nwhere I is the ideal sheaf defining q in Pnk\u0304 . These identifications of H 0 (Prk\u0304 , O(1)), H 0 (P\u0303nk\u0304 , O(dH \u2212\nE)) and H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , I(d)) show that the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree d vanishing at all\npoints of q defines a locally closed embedding f : Pnk\u0304 \u2212 q \u0592\u2192 Prk\u0304 . Let Li be a hyperplane in Prk\u0304\ncorresponding to a degree d hypersurface Hi (i = 1, 2, . . . , s) via the identification of H 0 (Prk\u0304 , O(1))\nand H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , I(d)).\nA. Stavrova and N.Vavilov are supported by RFBR 09-01-00878; I.Panin is supported by the joint DFG\u2013RFBR\nproject 09-01-91333-NNIO-a.\n\n1\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK-SERRE CONJECTURE I: APPENDIX\n\n2\n\nSet V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 := V\u0304 \u2032 \u2212 (V\u0304 \u2032 \u2229 q), V\u0304 \u0304 \u2032\u2032 := f (V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 ). Then V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 is isomorphic to V\u0304 \u0304 \u2032\u2032 and the construction of f\nimplies the following: if L1 \u2229 L2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Ls intersects V\u0304 \u0304 \u2032\u2032 transversally, then Y = H1 \u2229 H2 * * * \u2229 Hs\nintersects V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 transversally. Let V\u0304 \u0304 be the closure of V\u0304 \u0304 \u2032\u2032 in Prk\u0304 . Now the item (i) of Theorem [A,\nExp.XI, Thm. 2.1] applied to the pair V\u0304 \u0304 \u2032\u2032 \u2282 V\u0304 \u0304 implies our theorem with V\u0304 \u2032 replaced by V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 . It\nremains to consider points from V\u0304 \u2032 \u2229 q. At these points V\u0304 is k\u0304-smooth.\nIf we replace the integer d by a larger one, our result is still valid with V\u0304 \u2032 replaced by V\u0304 \u2032\u2032 . At\nthe same time, enlarging d we may achieve the following: among those hypersurfaces of degree d in\nPnk\u0304 that contain q, each one that is sufficiently general, intersects V\u0304 transversally at every point of\nV\u0304 \u2229 q. This can be easily deduced from the fact that, for a sufficiently large d, the sheaf sequence\n0 \u2192 I 2 (d) \u2192 O(d) \u2192 (O/I 2 )(d) = O/I 2 \u2192 0\ninduces an exact sequence of global sections\n0 \u2192 H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , I 2 (d)) \u2192 H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , O(d)) \u2192 H 0 (Pnk\u0304 , O/I 2 ) \u2192 0.\n\u0003\nNext we extend a result of Artin from [A] concerning existence of nice neighborhoods. The\nfollowing notion is due to Artin [A, Exp. XI, D\u00e9f. 3.1].\nDefinition 1. An elementary fibration is a morphism of schemes p : X \u2192 S that can be included\nin a commutative diagram\n(1)\n\nj\ni\n/Xo\nY\nX MM\nqq\nMMM\nq qqqq\nMMM\np\nqq\np MMM\nMM& \u000f xqqqqq\nS\n\nof morphisms satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) j is an open immersion dense at each fibre of p, and X = X \u2212 Y ;\n(ii) p is smooth projective all of whose fibres are geometrically irreducible of dimension one;\n(iii) q is finite \u00e9tale all of whose fibres are non-empty.\nUsing Theorem 1, one can prove the following result which is a slight extension of Artin's result\n[A, Exp.XI,Prop.3.3].\nProposition 1. Let k be an infinite field, X/k be a smooth geometrically irreducible variety,\nx1 , x2 , . . . , xn \u2208 X be closed points. Then there exists a Zariski open neighborhood X 0 of the\nfamily {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } and an elementary fibration p : X 0 \u2192 S, where S is an open sub-scheme of\nthe projective space Pdim X\u22121 .\nIf, moreover, Z is a closedTco-dimension one subvariety in X, then one can choose X 0 and p in\nsuch a way that p|Z T X 0 : Z X 0 \u2192 S is finite surjective.\nProof. The proof literally follows the proof of the original Artin's result. Shrinking\n`n X may assume\nthat X \u2282 Ar is affine and still contains the points x1 , x2 , . . . , xn . Set x := j=1 xi . Let X0 be\nthe closure of X in Pr . Let X\u0304 is the normalization of X0 and set Y = X\u0304 \u2212 X with the induced\nreduced structure. Let S \u2282 X\u0304 be the closed subset of X\u0304 consisting of all singular points. Then\none has\n(i) S \u2282 Y ,\n(ii) dim X\u0304 = dim X = n,\n(iii) dim Y = n \u2212 1,\n(iv) dim S \u2264 n \u2212 2.\nEmbed X\u0304 in a projective space Pt . Let M be the restriction of the invertible sheaf OPt (t) to X\u0304.\nTake the sheaf M \u2297d with the integer d from Theorem 1. Consider the embedding Pt \u0592\u2192 PN via\nthe full linear system of hypersurfaces of degree d in Pt . By Theorem 1 there exist hyperplanes\nH1 , H2 , . . . , Hn\u22121 on PN such that x \u2282 Hi , L := H1 \u2229 H2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Hn\u22121 has dimension N \u2212 n + 1\nand intersects X\u0304 and Y transversally. The intersection X\u0304 \u2229 L is a smooth geometrically irreducible\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK-SERRE CONJECTURE I: APPENDIX\n\n3\n\ncurve by Theorem 1. The intersection Y \u2229 L has dimension zero. Choose one more hyperplane H0\nin PN such that H0 intersect X\u0304 \u2229 L transversally and H0 \u2229 Y \u2229 L = \u2205.\nLet hi be a linear form in N + 1 variables t\u03bd , \u03bd = 1, . . . , N + 1, defining the hyperplane Hi\nq\nin PN . Consider a rational map PN \u2212\n\u2192 Pn\u22121 sending a point [t0 : t1 : * * * : tN ] to the point\n[u0 : u1 : * * * : un\u22121 ], where ui = hi (t0 , t1 , . . . , tN ). That morphism is a rational projection with\nthe projector center C = H0 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Hn\u22121 . Let \u01eb : P\u2032 \u2192 PN be the blow up of PN with the center\nC. Then the diagram\n(2)\n\nn\u22121\nP\nbEE\n;\nx\nx\nEE \u03c0\nq x\nx\nEE\nx\nx\nEE\nxx\n\u01eb\no\nP\u2032\nPN\n\ncommutes as a diagram of rational morphisms and the arrows \u01eb and \u03c0 are regular maps. Let\nX\u0304 \u2032 \u2282 P \u2032 be the proper preimage of X\u0304, that is the closure of \u01eb\u22121 ((X\u0304 \u2212 (X\u0304 \u2229C))). By the hypotheses\nmade C intersects X\u0304 transversally, and the morphism X\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 X\u0304 is the blow up at the k-smooth\nfinite center X\u0304 \u2229 C. The k-smoothness means that the scheme X\u0304 \u2229 C consists of finitely many\npoints, and their residue fields are finite separable field extensions of k.\nIdentify X \u2032 := X \u2212 (X\u0304 \u2229 C) with an open subscheme of X\u0304 \u2032 . Let Y \u2032 := X\u0304 \u2032 \u2212 X \u2032 be the closed\nsubscheme of X\u0304 \u2032 with the reduced subscheme structure. We claim that on the diagram\n(3)\n\nj\n/ X\u0304 \u2032 o i\nX\u2032 E\nY\u2032\nEE\ny\ny\nEE\ny\nf \u0304\u2032 yy\nE\nf \u2032 EE\" \u000f |yyy g\u2032\nPn\u22121\n\nthere exists an open neighborhood V of the point v = f \u2032 (x) such that the restriction of the diagram\n(3) to V satisfies the conditions (i), (ii), (iii) of Definition 1. If this claim is true, it completes the\nproof of the Proposition. We proceed to verify it.\nThe condition (i) is trivial. To obtain (ii), note that X\u0304\u2229L is a k-smooth geometrically irreducible\ncurve by the hypotheses. It follows that the morphism ((f \u2032 )\u22121 (v)) \u2192 X\u0304 \u2229 L induced by \u01eb is\nbiunivoque. Whence (f \u2032 )\u22121 (v))red \u2192 X\u0304 \u2229 L is bijective. To check that f \u0304\u2032 is smooth over a\nneighborhood of v, it suffices by a Lemma of Hironaka [SGA1, Exp.II, 2.6] to verify that f \u0304\u2032 is\nsmooth at a generic point of (f \u0304\u2032 )\u22121 (v). At that point X\u0304 \u2032 is isomorphic to X\u0304 and the morphism is\nsmooth, since L intersects X transversally.\n\u2032\nIt remains to prove that g \u2032 is \u00e9tale over a neighborhood\n` of v. It is clear that each fibre of g\nis non-empty since dim Y = n \u2212 1.

Here j and i are the same as in Definition 1, while prS \u25e6\u03c0 = p, where prS is the\nprojection A1 \u00d7 S \u2192 S.\nIn particular, \u03c0 : X \u2192 A1 \u00d7 S is a finite surjective morphism of S-schemes, where X and\n1\nA \u00d7 S are regarded as S-schemes via the morphism p and the projection prS , respectively.\nProof. To prove this Proposition it suffices to construct a finite surjective S-morphism \u03c0\u0304 : X \u2192\nP1 \u00d7 S such that Y = \u03c0 \u22121 ({\u221e} \u00d7 S) set-theoretically. To do that, we first note that, under the\nhypotheses of the Proposition, Y \u2282 X is an effective Cartier divisor. We will construct a desired\n\u03c0\u0304 using two sections t0 and t1 of the sheaf O(nY ) for a sufficiently large n. Assume that t0 and\nt1 are such that the vanishing locus of t0 is nY and the vanishing locus of t1 does not intersect Y .\nThen the pair t0 , t1 defines a regular map \u03c6 := [t0 : t1 ] : X \u2192 P1 . Set \u03c0\u0304 = (\u03c6, p\u0304) : X \u2192 P1 \u00d7 S.\nClearly, \u03c0\u0304 is an S-morphism of the S-schemes. It is a projective morphism since both S-schemes\nare projective S-schemes. It is a quasi-finite surjective morphism. In fact, for each point s \u2208 S the\nmorphism \u03c0\u0304 induces a non-constant morphism X s \u2192 P1s of two k(s)-smooth irreducible projective\nk(s)-curves. Thus \u03c0\u0304 is finite surjective as a quasi-finite projective morphism. It remains to find an\nappropriate integer n and two sections t0 and t1 with the above properties.\nFirstly, for each point s of the scheme S set X s := (\u03c0\u0304)\u22121 (s) scheme-theoretically and note that\nX s is a k(s)-smooth irreducible projective k(s)-curve. The morphism \u03c0\u0304 is smooth. In particular, it\nis flat. Whence the function s 7\u2192 \u03c7(X s , OX s ) is constant by Corollary [Mu, Ch.II, Sect.5, Cor.1].\nThe latter means that the genus g(X s ) is the same for all points s \u2208 S. Set g = g(X s ).\nAssume that n \u2265 2g \u2212 1, then h0 (X s , OX s (nYs )) = \u03c7(X s , OX s (nYs )) = n \u2212 g + 1. Let En :=\np\u0304\u2217 (OX s (nYs ))). By Corollary [Mu, II, Sect.5, Cor.1] and Lemma [Mu, II, Sect.5, Lem.1] the sheaf\nEn on S is locally free of rank n \u2212 g + 1, and for each point s \u2208 S one has En \u2297OS k(s) \u223c\n=\nH 0 (X s , OX s (nYs )).\n`\nQ\nLet s = si , where si are all closed points of the semi-local scheme S. Let k(s) =\nk(si ),\nwhere k(si ) is the residue field of the point si . Consider a commutative diagram\n(5)\n\nH 0 (S, En )\n\nid\n\n\u03b1\n\n/ H 0 (X, O (nY ))\nX\n\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n\nEn \u2297OS k(s)\n\ncan\n\n\u000f\n/ H 0 (X s , O (nYs )),\nXs\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 and can are the canonical homomorphisms. As it was mentioned in the previous\nparagraph, the map can is an isomorphism. The map \u03b1 is surjective, since s is a closed subscheme\nof an affine scheme S. Whence the map \u03b2 is surjective.\nFor each si \u2208 s the curve Xsi is a smooth geometrically irreducible curve of genus g. Whence\nthere exists an integer n0 such that for each n \u2265 n0 the sheaf OX s (nYs ) is very ample. By the\nBertini type theorem [A, Exp.XI,Thm.2.1] there exists for any i a section t1,i of OX s (nYsi ) that\ni\ndoes not vanish on Ysi . By the surjectivity of \u03b2 we may choose a section t1 of OX (nY ) such that\n\u03b2(t1 )|X s = t1,i for any i. The vanishing locus of t1 does not intersect Ys , whence it does not\ni\nintersect Y . Clearly, t1 is the desired section of OX (nY ). It remains to take for t0 a section of\nOX (nY ) with the vanishing locus nY .\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK-SERRE CONJECTURE I: APPENDIX\n\n5\n\n2. Equating group schemes\nThe following result is Proposition 9.1 of [PaSV].\nProposition 3. Let S be a regular semi-local irreducible scheme and let G1 , G2 be two semi-simple\nsimply connected S-group schemes which are twisted forms of each other. Further, let T \u2282 S be\na closed subscheme of S and \u03c6 : G1 |T \u2192 G2 |T be an S-group scheme isomorphism. Then there\n\u03c0\nexist a finite \u00e9tale morphism S\u0303 \u2212\n\u2192 S together with a morphism \u03b4 : T \u2192 S\u0303 of schemes over S, and\na S\u0303-group scheme isomorphism \u03a6 : \u03c0 \u2217 G1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 G2 such that \u03b4 \u2217 (\u03a6) = \u03c6.\nSince the proof of the Proposition is rather long we first give an outline. Clearly, G1 and G2 are\nof the same type. By [SGA3, Vol.153, Exp.XXIV, Cor.1.8] there exists an S-scheme IsomS (G1 , G2 )\nrepresenting the functor that sends an S-scheme W to the set of all W -group scheme isomorphisms\nfrom W \u00d7S G1 to W \u00d7S G2 .

By Lemmas 3 and 1\nbelow there exists a closed subscheme S\u0303 of IsomS (G1 , G2 ) which is finite \u00e9tale over S and contains\n\u03b4(T ).

Clearly, G1 and G2 are of the same type. Let G0 be a split semi-simple\nsimply connected algebraic group over the ground field k such that G1 and G2 are twisted forms\nof the S-group scheme S \u00d7Spec(k) G0 . Let Autk (G0 ) be the automorphism scheme of the algebraic\nk-group G0 . It is known that Autk (G0 ) is a semi-direct product of the algebraic k-group Gad\n0 and\na finite group, where Gad\n0 is a group adjoint to G0 . Also, Autk (G0 ) is a smooth affine algebraic\nk-group (for example, by [SGA3, Vol.153, Exp.XXIV, Cor.1.8]). Set for short Aut := Autk (G0 )\nand AutS for the S-group scheme S \u00d7Spec(k) Aut.\nConsider an S-scheme IsomS (G0,S , G2 ) constructed in [SGA3, Vol.153, Exp.XXIV, Cor.1.8] and\nrepresenting a functor that sends an S-scheme W to the set of all W -group scheme isomorphisms\n\u03c62 : W \u00d7S G0,S \u2192 W \u00d7S G2 .

There is a closed embedding of algebraic groups \u03c1 : Aut \u0592\u2192\nGLV,k for an n-dimensional k-vector space V .

If M is a trivial H \u2032 -bundle, then there exists a principal Hbundle F0 over W such that pr\u2217 (F0 ) \u223c\n= F , where pr : P1W \u2192 W is the canonical projection.\nProof. Set X = H \u2032 /j(H).

By results of Haboush [Hab] and Nagata [Na] (see Nisnevich\n\u2032\n/H0,k is an affine k-scheme.

The Lemma is proved.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK-SERRE CONJECTURE I: APPENDIX\n\n9\n\nProof of Theorem 2. Let U = Spec(O). The U -group scheme G is given by a 1-cocycle \u03be \u2208\nZ 1 (U, Aut), where Aut is the k-algebraic group from Section 2 (the automorphism group of the\nsplit group G0 from that Section). Recall that Aut \u223c\n= Gad\n0 \u22ca N , where N is the finite group of\nad\nautomorphisms of the Dynkin diagram of G0 , and G0 is the adjoint group corresponding to G0 .\nSince Aut \u223c\n= Gad\n0 \u22ca N , we have an exact sequence of pointed sets\n1\nad\n1\n{1} \u2192 H 1 (U, Gad\n0 ) \u2192 H (U, G0 \u22ca N ) \u2192 H (U, N ).\n\nThus there is a finite \u00e9tale morphism \u03c0 : V \u2192 U such that GV := G \u00d7U V is given by a 1-cocycle\n\u03beV \u2208 Z 1 (U, Gad\n0 ).\nFor each fundamental weight \u03bb of G0 , there is a central (also called center preserving, see [PS])\nrepresentation \u03c1\u03bb : G0 \u2192 GLV\u03bb ,k , where V\u03bb is the Weyl module corresponding to \u03bb. This gives a\ncommutative diagram of k-group morphisms\n(14)\n\n\u03c1\u03bb\n\nG0\n\u000f\nGad\n0\n\n/ GLV\u03bb ,k\n\u000f\n/ P GLV\u03bb ,k .\n\n\u03c1\u0304\u03bb\n\nConsidering the product of \u03c1\u03bb 's with \u03bb running over the set \u039b of all fundamental weights, we obtain\nthe following commutative diagram of algebraic k-group homomorphisms:\nQ\n\u03c1\n/ \u03bb\u2208\u039b GLV\u03bb ,k\n(15)\nG0\n\u000f\nGad\n0\n\n\u03c1\u0304\n\n/\n\nQ\n\n\u000f\nP\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b GLV\u03bb ,k .\n\nNote that \u03c1 is a closed embedding. This fact will be used below.\nTwisting the\nQ k-group morphism \u03c1 with the 1-cocycle \u03beV we get an V -group scheme morphism\n\u03c1V : GV \u2192 \u03bb\u2208\u039b GL1,A\u03bb , where the product is taken over V , and each A\u03bb is an Azumaya\n1\nalgebra\nQ over V obtained from End(V\u03bb ) via the 1-cocycle \u03b8\u03bb = (\u03c1\u0304\u03bb )\u2217 (\u03beV ) \u2208 Z (V, P GLV\u03bb ). Set\nH = \u03bb\u2208\u039b GL1,A\u03bb . One has\nHomV (GV , H) = HomU (G, RV /U (H)),\nwhere RV /U is the Weil restriction functor. Thus \u03c1V determines an U -morphism\n\u03c1U : G \u0592\u2192 RV /U (H).\nWell-known properties of the functor RV /U imply that \u03c1U is a U -group scheme morphism. Note\nthat, since \u03c1 is a closed embedding, \u03c1U is a closed embedding as well (by \u00e9tale descent).\nRecall that we are given with a principal G-bundle E \u2208 H 1 (P1 , G). The map\n(\u03c1U )\u2217 : H 1 (P1 , G) \u2192 H 1 (P1 , RV /U (H))\nproduces a principal RV /U (H)-bundle (\u03c1U )\u2217 (E) over P1 .\nBy the Shapiro-Faddeev Lemma (for example, [SGA3, Exp. XXIV Prop. 8.4]), there is an\nisomorphism of pointed sets\n(16)\n\nH 1 (P1 , RV /U (H)) \u223c\n= H 1 (P1 \u00d7U V, H).\n\nLet F be a principal H-bundle Q\nover P1 \u00d7U V corresponding to the bundle (\u03c1U )\u2217 (E) via the latter\nisomorphism. Recall that H = \u03bb\u2208\u039b GL1,A\u03bb . Consider the compositions of the closed embeddings\nY\nj : H \u0592\u2192\nGLA\u03bb \u0592\u2192 GL\u2295A\u03bb ,\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nwhere GLA\u03bb (resp. GL\u2295A\u03bb ) is the V -group scheme of automorphisms of A\u03bb (resp. \u2295A\u03bb ) regarded\nas an OV -module.\nRecall that the original G-bundle E is trivial on P1l = P1 \u00d7U x \u2282 P1 . It follows that the\nRV /U (H)-bundle (\u03c1U )\u2217 (E) is trivial on P1 \u00d7U x \u2282 P1 . Hence the H-bundle F is trivial on\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK-SERRE CONJECTURE I: APPENDIX\n\n10\n\nP1 \u00d7U \u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2286 P1 \u00d7U V . Hence the GL\u2295A\u03bb -bundle j\u2217 (F ) is trivial on P1 \u00d7U \u03c0 \u22121 (x). The\nV -group scheme GL\u2295A\u03bb is just the ordinary general linear group, since V is semi-local. Thus\nj\u2217 (F ) corresponds to a vector bundle M over P1 \u00d7U V . Moreover, this vector bundle is trivial on\nP1 \u00d7U \u03c0 \u22121 (x). By Horrocks' theorem the bundle M is trivial on P1 \u00d7U V . Thus j\u2217 (F ) is a trivial\nGL\u2295A\u03bb -bundle.\n\u2217\nNow, applying Lemma 4 to\nQ the embedding j : H \u0592\u2192 GL\u2295A\u03bb , we see that F = pr (F0 ) for some\n1\nF0 \u2208 H (V, H). Since H = \u03bb\u2208\u039b GL1,A\u03bb and V is semi-local, the bundle F0 is trivial by Hilbert\n90 for Azumaya algebras. Whence F is trivial as well. The isomorphism (16) shows that (\u03c1U )\u2217 (E)\nis trivial too. Now, applying Lemma 4 to W = U , j = \u03c1U : G \u0592\u2192 RV /U (H) and F = E, we see\n\u2217\nthat there exists a principal G-bundle E0 over U such that prU\n(E0 ) \u223c\n= E. The theorem is proved.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[A] M. Artin, Comparaison avec la cohomologie classique: cas d'un pr\u00e9sch\u00e8ma lisse. in SGA4, Exp. XI, 64\u201378.\n[B] N.
