Introduction\nEffective theories provide a convenient tool to analyze the low-energy properties of\nsystems characterized by a separation of scales. If the scattering length a of two\nnon-relativistic particles is much larger than the typical low-energy scale l of the\nsystem, one can use an effective theory with contact interactions only to compute\nlow-energy observables in an expansion in l/a. A particular feature of this theory\nis that a three-body force is needed at leading order for consistent renormalization\nonce one considers systems with more than two particles. Its renormalization group\nflow is governed by a limit cycle 1,2 . Once this three-body is force introduced this\nEFT gains predictive power and can be used to calculate three-body observables. In\n3,4,5 we have applied this effective theory to the four-body system with short-range\ninteractions. Here we will summarize the most important results without going into\nthe technical details of the calculations.\n2. The Two- and Three-Body System\nUsing an effective potential approach we are able to use familiar quantum mechanical equations to solve for observables. The bare EFT potential in the two-body\nS-wave sector at leading order is given by\nhk|VEF T |k\u2032 i = \u03bb2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis potential has to be regulated to handle appearing divergences and to separate\nthe low-momentum degrees of freedom from the high-momentum degrees of free\u2217 current\n\naddress Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701, USA\n1\n\n\fOctober 11, 2018\n\n16:55\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nproceedings\n\n2\n\ndom. The regulated potential at leading order is hk|V |k\u2032 i = g(k) \u03bb2 g(k\u2032 ), where\ng(k) = exp(\u2212k 2 /\u039b2 ) is the regulator function suppressing momenta with k \u226a \u039b.\nThe resulting interaction is separable which allows to solve the two-body problem\nexactly. The two-body t-matrix can be written as\nt(z) = |gi\u03c4 (z)hg| ,\nhere \u03c4 denotes the two-body propagator\nZ\nq 2 exp(\u22122q 2 /\u039b2 )\n1\n\u2212 4\u03c0 dq\n\u03c4 (z)\u22121 =\n\u03bb2\nz \u2212 q2\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere and in the following we use units with ~ = m = 1. The coupling constant \u03bb2\ncan be fixed by matching either to the binding energy or the scattering length of the\ntwo-body system. The three-body force (which is needed to renormalize the threebody system) is given by V3 = |\u03bei\u03bb3 h\u03be| , where \u03be(u1 , u2 ) = exp(\u2212(u21 + 43 u22 )/\u039b2 ) is\nthe corresponding regulator function and u2 represents the second Jacobi momentum in the three-body system. The three-body coupling constant \u03bb3 can be fixed\nby demanding that the binding energy of the shallowest three-body bound state\nstays constant as the cutoff \u039b is changed.\nVarious three-body observables have been calculated using an equivalent fieldtheoretical approach 1,2,6 , the charge form factor and radius has been computed\nusing an effective potential approach 7 .\n3. The Four-Body System\nWe have computed the binding energies of the 4 He tetramer and the \u03b1-particle by\nemploying the Yakubovsky equations. As three-body input we used the energy of\nthe shallowest three-body bound state as calculated by Blume and Greene (BG) 8\nand the triton binding energy, respectively. An analysis of the cutoff dependence\nof the results for the binding energies shows that no four-body force is needed\nto renormalize the four-body sector. Further, a comparison of our 4 He tetramer\nresults with the values obtained by BG 8 is shown in Table 1. The results of their\ncalculation for the trimer and tetramer are given in the two right columns of Table 1,\nwhile our results are given in the two left columns. In general, our results are in\ngood agreement with the values of BG. We also analyzed the correlation between\nthree-body and four-body binding energies.\nFor the \u03b1-particle binding energy, we find B\u03b1 = 29.5 MeV. If the deuteron binding\nenergy Bd is used as input instead of the triplet scattering length at , we obtain\nB\u03b1 = 26.9 MeV. This variation is consistent with the expected 30% accuracy of a\nleading order calculation in l/|a|. Our results agree with the (Coulomb corrected)\nexperimental value B\u03b1exp = (29.0 \u00b1 0.1) MeV to within 10%.\nIn addition, our framework allows for an analysis of universal properties of these\nsystems by keeping observables in the two-body system fixed and changing the\nproperties of the three-body system. The result of this is shown in Fig. 1. The\n\n\fOctober 11, 2018\n\n16:55\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nproceedings\n\n3\nTable 1.

This phenomenon has been known for a long\ntime in nuclear physics (Tjon-line). It follows immediately from the absence of a\nfour-nucleon force at leading order in this approach.\nLow-dimensional systems are center of interest in various fields of physics. By\nrelying on the asymptotic freedom of non-relativistic bosons in 2D with attractive short-range interactions, some interesting universal properties of self-bound\nN -boson droplets were predicted for N \u226b 1 14 .

More recently, they were recalculated\n(0)\nwith higher precision 16,14 : the ground state has B3 = 16.522688(1) B2 and there\n35\n\n600\n\n30\nB\u03b1 [MeV]\n\n(0)\n\nB4 [B2]\n\n500\n\n400\n\n25\n\n300\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n(0)\nB3 [B2]\n\n130\n\n20\n7,5\n\n8\n\n8,5\n\n9\n\nBt [MeV]\n\nFigure 1.\nThe left plot shows the correlation between the ground state energies of the 4 He\ntrimer and tetramer.

The value of the ground state\n(0)\nenergy B3 differs from the prediction in Eq. (4) by a factor of two, indicating\nthat the three-body system is not in the asymptotic regime. We have calculated\nthe binding energies of the four-boson system in 2D using the same approach as in\nthree spatial dimensions. In contradistinction to the 3D case no three-body force\nand therefore no three-body input is needed. Similar to the three-body system,\n(0)\nwe find exactly two bound states: the ground state with B4 = 197.3(1) B2 and\n(1)\none excited state with B4 = 25.5(1) B2 .

Summary\nWe have shown, that four-body systems with large scattering length can be described within the framework of an effective theory with contact interactions only.\nOur results for the binding energies of the 4 He tetramer and the \u03b1-particle are\nin good agreement with theoretical calculations and the experimental value, respectively. The linear correlation between the three-body binding energies and the\nfour-body binding energies (Tjon-line) turns out to be a universal result of systems\nwith large scattering length and can be understood by the absence of a four-body\nforce at leading order.\nFurther, we computed the binding energies of the four-boson system in two spatial dimensions and showed that the four-body results lie significantly closer to the\nassymptotic value for BN /BN \u22121 than the three-body results.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was done in collaboration with H.-W.
