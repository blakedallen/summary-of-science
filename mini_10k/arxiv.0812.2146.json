We present synthetic FeH band spectra in the z-filter range for several M-dwarf models\nwith log g = 3.0 \u2212 5.0 [cgs] and Teff = 2800 K \u2212 3450 K. Our aim is to characterize convective velocities in M-dwarfs and to give a rough estimate of the range in which 3D-atmosphere treatment\nis necessary and where 1D-atmosphere models suffice for the interpretation of molecular spectral features. This is also important in order to distinguish between the velocity-broadening and\nthe rotational- or Zeeman-broadening. The synthetic spectra were calculated using 3D CO5BOLD\nradiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) models and the line synthesis code LINFOR3D. We used complete\n3D-models and high resolution 3D spectral synthesis for the detailed study of some well isolated\nFeH lines. The FeH line strength shows a dependence on surface gravity and effective temperature and could be employed to measure both quantities in M-type objects. The line width is related\nto the velocity-field in the model stars, which depends strongly on surface gravity. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the velocity-field in the 3D M-dwarf models together with the related micro- and\nmacro-turbulent velocities in the 1D case. We also search for effects on the lineshapes.\nKeywords: Radiative transfer - Line: profiles - Stars: atmospheres, low-mass, kinematics\nPACS: 95.30.Jx, 95.30.Ky, 95.30.Lz, 95.75.Fg\n\nSINGLE 3D- AND <3D>- FeH LINES\nIn this work, we use the radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) model-atmospheres (see Tab. 1)\nwhich were computed with the CO5BOLD-code employing opacity binning (see e.g. [1]\nor [2]) with five bands to take into account the wavelength dependence of the radiative energy exchange. To calculate the spectral lines, we use the line synthesis code\nLINFOR3D1, which is able to use the 3D capacity of the CO5BOLD-atmosphere models. We investigated 10 FeH lines between 9950 \u00c5 and 9990 \u00c5 which were chosen from\n[3] (see Tab. 2). The resolution of the synthetic spectra is \u2206\u03bb = 5 * 10\u22123 \u00c5 corresponding\nto a Doppler velocity of \u2248150 m/s at the wavelength of the considered lines. We averaged over the spatial x-y directions in the 3D-model to receive a 1D-model, which we\ncall the <3D>-model. This model is used for comparison between the modelled 3D and\n<3D> FeH lines to investigate the effect of micro and macro turbulent velocities. The\n3D velocity fields are not taken into account in the <3D>-models, and line broadening\nis treated within the classical scheme of micro- and macro-turbulence. In Fig. 1 one can\nsee that there is a strong influence of surface gravity and effective temperature on the\nlineshape for the 3D-models. Regarding the <3D>-models, the effect on line depth with\n1\n\nsee http://www.aip.de/~mst/Linfor3D/linfor_3D_manual.pdf\n\n\fchanging log g is less obvious. Line depth changes in the 3D case can be explained by\nline broadening by the hydrodynamical velocity field. The equivalent width of the lines\nis not strongly affected since they are only mildly saturated (see Fig. 2).\n\nFIGURE 1.

A run\nof these quantities is plotted in Fig. 2.\nEquivalent width (Fig. 2 top): The equivalent width shows little difference between the\n3D and the <3D> lines. This difference stays almost constant in both cases (different\nTeff and log g). This indicates that the deviations between the FeH lines are due to\nvelocity broadening, which should only mildly affect the equivalent width. The run of\nthe equivalent width in the log g-series seems to stay almost constant and is only weakly\n\n\fdependent on surface gravity. With different effective temperatures the number of FeH\nmolecules varies strongly and hence the equivalent width. It decrease with increasing\nTeff due to the dissociation of the FeH-molecules.\nGaussian FWHM (Fig. 2 middle): The dependence of the line width (FWHM) on the\nsurface gravity is very different for 3D- and <3D>-models. In the 3D case the FWHM\ndecreases but in the <3D> case the FWHM increases with increasing surface gravity. The\ndifference between 3D and <3D> lines at log g = 3.0 is around 1 km/s. We point out\nthat in the <3D>-model we did not add any micro- or macro-turbulence. The increasing\nline width in the 3D case is a consequence of the hydrodynamic velocity fields which\nincrease strongly with decreasing log g. In the Teff series, the effect of velocity related\nbroadening is not as strong as in the log g case, but we believe that the difference between\n3D- and <3D>-models stems from the appearing velocity fields, too.\nLine depth (Fig. 2 bottom): The difference in line depths between 3D- and <3D>models is consistent with the velocity fields present in the atmospheres of the models.\nIn the log g series the run of the line depth is very similar to the equivalent width and\nreflects the almost constant number of FeH molecules. In the Teff series, the line depth\nshows a strong dependence on effective temperature and decreases with increasing Teff .\n\nFIGURE 2. Left: Run of the equivalent width (top), the gaussian width (middle) and the line depth\n(bottom) for a model with Teff = 3300K and log g values of 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 [cgs]. Plotted are the\naforementioned quantities of the ten FeH-lines explained in Tab.2. For more information see text.\nRight: Same quantities and lines for Teff 's of 2800 K, 3300 K and 3450 K and a log g value of 5.0 [cgs].\n\nVELOCITY FIELDS\nThe velocity broadening has a noteworthy influence especially at low log g values. To\ninvestigate the velocity fields in the models, we use the curve of growth method. This\nemploys the artificial increase of the line strenght of a Ca I-line. Ca I-lines produced\non <3D>-models with different micro-turbulent velocities enable us to determine a\nmicro-turbulent velocity for the 3D-model. We use the Ca I micro-turbulent velocities\nto convolve the <3D>-model lines with gaussian velocity profiles. A comparison with\n<3D> lines which include the afore determined micro-turbulent velocities computed\nwith LINFOR3D, shows that the difference between both lines is insignificant. We\nbroaden these lines by convolution with a Gaussian profile again until they match the\n\n\f3D lines and obtain an effective macro-turbulent velocity this way. The dependence of\nthe micro- and macro-turbulent velocities on surface gravity and effective temperature\nis plotted in Fig. 3. One can see that the velocity field represents the behavior of the\nquantities investigated above and gives an explanation for the differences between 3Dand <3D>-models.\n\nFIGURE 3. Left: Micro- and macro-turbulent velocities as a function of log g. Right: Micro- and macroturbulent velocities as a function of Teff .\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe have investigated ten single well isolated FeH lines between 9950 \u00c5 and 9990 \u00c5 on\na set of 3D-CO5BOLD models, with the spectral sythesis code LINFOR3D. We found\nthat the FeH lines react on different effective temperatures as one would expect due\nto the change in the FeH molecule number. The lines also show a weak dependence on\nsurface gravity but if one includes the velocity-fields in the models, the log g dependence\nis strong due to the strong velocity broadening. This means for the 1D spectral synthesis\nthat one has to include correct micro- and macro-turbulent velocities for small surface\ngravities or the line width would be to small up to 1 km/s. At high surface gravities, the\nFeH lines show a significant difference between <3D> and 3D models only for higher\neffective temperatures. This means that in the considered atmospheres thermal Doppler\nbroadening is the dominant velocity-related broadening mechanism.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSW would like to acknowledge the support from the DFG Research Training Group\nGrK - 1351 \"Extrasolar Planets and their host stars\".
