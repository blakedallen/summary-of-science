The\nP\nlight-front momentum fractions xi = ki+ /P\u03c0+ = (k 0 + kiz )/(P 0 + P z ) with ni=1 xi = 1\nP\nand ~k\u22a5i with ni=1 ~k\u22a5i = ~0\u22a5 represent the relative momentum coordinates of the QCD\nconstituents; the scalar light-front wavefunctions \u03c8n/p (xi , ~k\u22a5i , \u03bbi ) are independent of\nthe proton's momentum P + = P 0 + P z , and P\u22a5 . The physical transverse momenta\nare p~\u22a5i = xi P~\u22a5 +~k\u22a5i . The \u03bbi label the light-front spin S z projections of the quarks and\ngluons along the quantization z direction. The spinors of the light-front formalism\nautomatically incorporate the Melosh-Wigner rotation. Light-cone gauge A+ = 0 is\nused to eliminate unphysical gauge degrees of freedom. The gluon polarization vectors\n\u01eb\u03bc (k, \u03bb = \u00b11) are specified in light-cone gauge by the conditions k * \u01eb = 0, \u03b7 * \u01eb =\n\u01eb+ = 0. The quark and gluon degrees of freedom are all physical; there are effectively\nno ghost or negative metric states.\nAn important feature of the light-front formalism is that the projection Jz of the\ntotal angular momentum is kinematical and conserved. Each light-front Fock state\nP\nPn\u22121 z\ncomponent satisfies the angular momentum sum rule: J z = ni=1 Siz + j=1\nlj . The\nz\nsummation over Si represents the contribution of the intrinsic spins of the n Fock\nstate constituents. The summation over orbital angular momenta\nljz\n\n= \u2212i\n\nkjx\n\n\u2202\ny \u2202\ny \u2212 kj\n\u2202kj\n\u2202kjx\n\n!\n\n(2)\n\nderives from the n \u2212 1 relative momenta. This excludes the contribution to the\norbital angular momentum due to the motion of the center of mass, which is not an\nintrinsic property of the hadron. The light-front eigensolution corresponds to a spin\nJ particle in the hadron rest frame P + = P \u2212 = M, P~\u22a5 = ~0, not the constituent\nP\nP\nrest frame i ~ki = ~0 since i kiz 6= P z . The numerator structure of the light-front\n2\n\n\fwavefunctions is in large part determined by the angular momentum constraints.\nThus wavefunctions generated by perturbation theory[2, 3] can provide a template\nfor the numerator structure of nonperturbative light-front wavefunctions.\nHadronic amplitudes can be computed by inserting a sum over a complete sets\nof free Fock states for each external hadron, thus representing the dynamics of each\nhadron as a convolution of its light-front wavefunctions with the corresponding nparticle irreducible quark-gluon matrix elements, summed over n. For example, in\nthe case of spacelike form factors, the matrix elements of local currents are given by a\nsimple overlap of light-front wavefunctions. If one chooses the frame with q + = 0, then\nmatrix elements of currents such as j + in electroweak theory and have only diagonal\nmatrix elements n\u2032 = n. Thus once one has solved for the light-front wavefunctions,\none can compute hadron matrix elements of currents between hadronic states of\narbitrary momentum. Remarkably, quantum fluctuations of the vacuum are absent\nif one uses light-front time to quantize the system, so that matrix elements such\nas the electromagnetic form factors only depend on the currents of the constituents\ndescribed by the light-cone wavefunctions. As I discuss below, the degrees of freedom\nassociated with vacuum phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking in the\nHiggs model have their counterpart in light-front k + = 0 zero modes of the fields.\nMatrix elements of spacelike currents such as spacelike electromagnetic form factors thus have an exact representation in terms of simple overlaps of the light-front\nwavefunctions in momentum space with the same xi and unchanged parton number\nn.[4, 5, 6] The Pauli form factor and anomalous moment are spin-flip matrix elements\nof j + and thus connect states with \u2206Lz = 1.[6] Thus, these quantities are nonzero only\nif there is nonzero orbital angular momentum of the quarks in the proton. The Dirac\nform factor is diagonal in Lz and is typically dominated at high Q2 by highest states\nwith the highest orbital angular momentum. In the case of nuclear form factors, Fock\nstates with \"hidden color\" play an important role, particularly at large momentum\ntransfer.[7] The formulae for electroweak current matrix elements of j + can be easily\nextended to the T ++ coupling of gravitons. In, fact, one can show that the anomalous gravito-magnetic moment B(0), analogous to F2 (0) in electromagnetic current\ninteractions, vanishes identically for any system, composite or elementary.[2] This\nimportant feature, which follows in general from the equivalence principle [8, 9, 10],\nis obeyed explicitly in the light-front formalism.[2]\nThe light-front Fock representation is especially advantageous in the study of\nexclusive B decays. For example, we can write down an exact frame-independent\nrepresentation of decay matrix elements such as B \u2192 Dl\u03bd from the overlap of n\u2032 = n\nparton conserving wavefunctions and the overlap of n\u2032 = n\u22122 from the annihilation of\na quark-antiquark pair in the initial wavefunction.[11] The off-diagonal n + 1 \u2192 n \u2212 1\ncontributions give a new perspective for the physics of B-decays. A semileptonic\ndecay involves not only matrix elements where a quark changes flavor, but also a\ncontribution where the leptonic pair is created from the annihilation of a qq \u2032 pair\n3\n\n\fwithin the Fock states of the initial B wavefunction. The semileptonic decay thus\ncan occur from the annihilation of a nonvalence quark-antiquark pair in the initial\nhadron. Intrinsic charm | bucci states of the B meson, although small in probability,\ncan play an important role in its weak decays because they facilitate CKM-favored\nweak decays.[12] The \"handbag\" contribution to the leading-twist off-forward parton\ndistributions measured in deeply virtual Compton scattering has a similar light-front\nwavefunction representation as overlap integrals of light-front wavefunctions.[13, 14]\nIn the case of hadronic amplitudes involving a hard momentum transfer Q, it is\n2\n/Q2 .\noften possible to expand the quark-gluon scattering amplitude as a function of k\u22a5\nThe leading-twist contribution then can be computed from a hard-scattering amplitude TH where the external quarks and gluons emanating from each hadron can be\ntaken as collinear. The convolution with the light-front wavefunction and integration \u03a0i d2 k\u22a5i over the relative transverse momentum projects out only the Lz = 0\ncomponent of the light-front wavefunctions. This leads to hadron spin selection rules\nsuch as hadron helicity conservation.[15] Furthermore, only the minimum number\nof quark and gluon quanta contribute at leading order in 1/Q2 . The nominal scaling of hard hadron scattering amplitudes at leading twist then obeys dimensional\ncounting rules.[16, 17, 18] Recently these rules have been derived to all orders in\nthe gauge coupling in conformal QCD and large NC using gauge/string duality.[19]\nThere is also evidence from hadronic \u03c4 decays that the QCD coupling approaches an\ninfrared fixed-point at low scales.[20] This may explain the empirical success of conformal approximations to QCD. The distribution amplitudes \u03c6(xi , Q) which appear in\nfactorization formulae for hard exclusive processes are the valence LF Fock wavefunctions integrated over the relative transverse momenta up to the resolution scale Q.[21]\nThese quantities specify how a hadron shares its longitudinal momentum among its\nvalence quarks; they control virtually all exclusive processes involving a hard scale Q,\nincluding form factors, Compton scattering, semi-exclusive processes,[22] and photoproduction at large momentum transfer, as well as the decay of a heavy hadron into\nspecific final states.[23, 24]\nThe quark and gluon probability distributions qi (x, Q) and g(x, Q) of a hadron can\nbe computed from the absolute squares of the light-front wavefunctions, integrated\nover the transverse momentum. All helicity distributions are thus encoded in terms of\nthe light-front wavefunctions. The DGLAP evolution of the structure functions can\nbe derived from the high k\u22a5 properties of the light-front wavefunctions. Thus given\nthe light-front wavefunctions, one can compute[21] all of the leading twist helicity and\ntransversity distributions measured in polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering. Similarly, the transversity distributions and off-diagonal helicity convolutions are defined\nas a density matrix of the light-front wavefunctions.\nHowever, it is not true that the leading-twist structure functions Fi (x, Q2 ) measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are identical to the quark and gluon distributions. It is usually assumed, following the parton model, that the F2 structure\n4\n\n\ffunction measured in neutral current deep inelastic lepton scattering is at leading\nP\norder in 1/Q2 simply F2 (x, Q2 ) = q e2q xq(x, Q2 ), where x = xbj = Q2 /2p * q and\nq(x, Q) can be computed from the absolute square of the proton's light-front wavefunction. Recent work by Hoyer, Marchal, Peigne, Sannino, and myself shows that\nthis standard identification is wrong.[25] In fact, one cannot neglect the Wilson line\nintegral between currents in the current correlator even in light-cone gauge. In the\ncase of light-cone gauge, the Wilson line involves the transverse gluon field A\u22a5 not\nA+ .[26] Gluon exchange between the fast, outgoing partons and the target spectators\naffects the leading-twist structure functions in a profound way. The final-state interactions lead to the Bjorken-scaling diffractive component \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 pX of deep inelastic\nscattering. The diffractive scattering of the fast outgoing quarks on spectators in the\ntarget in turn causes shadowing in the DIS cross section. Thus the depletion of the\nnuclear structure functions is not intrinsic to the wave function of the nucleus, but\nis a coherent effect arising from the destructive interference of diffractive channels\ninduced by final-state interactions. Similarly, the effective Pomeron distribution of\na hadron is not derived from its light-front wavefunction and thus is not a universal\nproperty. Many properties involving parton transverse momentum are also affected\nby the Wilson line.[27]\nMeasurements from the HERMES and SMC collaborations show a remarkably\nlarge single-spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive pion leptoproduction \u03b3 \u2217 (q)p \u2192 \u03c0X\nwhen the proton is polarized normal to the photon-to-pion production plane. Hwang,\nSchmidt, and I [28] have shown that final-state interactions from gluon exchange between the outgoing quark and the target spectator system lead to single-spin asymmetries in deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering at leading twist in perturbative QCD;\ni.e., the rescattering corrections are not power-law suppressed at large photon virtuality Q2 at fixed xbj . The existence of such single-spin asymmetries requires a phase\ndifference between two amplitudes coupling the proton target with Jpz = \u00b1 12 to the\nsame final-state, the same amplitudes which are necessary to produce a nonzero proton anomalous magnetic moment. The single-spin asymmetry which arises from such\nfinal-state interactions does not factorize into a product of distribution function and\nfragmentation function, and it is not related to the transversity distribution \u03b4q(x, Q)\nwhich correlates transversely polarized quarks with the spin of the transversely polarized target nucleon. In general all measures of quark and gluon transverse momentum\nrequire consideration of final-state interactions as incorporated in the Wilson line.\nThese effects highlight the unexpected importance of final- and initial-state interactions in QCD observables-they lead to leading-twist single-spin asymmetries,\ndiffraction, and nuclear shadowing, phenomena not included in the light-front wavefunctions of the target. Alternatively, as discussed by Belitsky, Ji, and Yuan,[26] one\ncan augment the light-front wavefunctions by including the phases induced by initial\nand final state interactions. Such wavefunctions correspond to solving the light-front\nbound state equation in an external field.\n5\n\n\f2\n\nThe Light-Front Quantization of QCD\n\n\u2202\nIn Dirac's \"Front Form\"[29], the generator of light-front time translations is P \u2212 = i \u2202\u03c4\n.\n\u2212\nBoundary conditions are set on the transverse plane labelled by x\u22a5 and x = z \u2212 ct.\nGiven the Lagrangian of a quantum field theory, P \u2212 can be constructed as an operator\non the Fock basis, the eigenstates of the free theory. Since each particle in the Fock\nk 2 +m2\nbasis is on its mass shell, k \u2212 \u2261 k 0 \u2212 k 3 = \u22a5k+ , and its energy k 0 = 21 (k + + k \u2212 )\nis positive, only particles with positive momenta k + \u2261 k 0 + k 3 \u2265 0 can occur in the\nP\nFock basis. Since the total plus momentum P + = n kn+ is conserved, the light-cone\nvacuum cannot have any particle content.\nThe Heisenberg equation on the light-front is\n\nHLC | \u03a8i = M 2 | \u03a8i .\n\n(3)\n\nThe operator HLC = P + P \u2212 \u2212P\u22a52 , the \"light-cone Hamiltonian\", is frame-independent.\nThis can in principle be solved by diagonalizing the matrix hn|HLC |mi on the free\nFock basis: [30]\nX\nhn|HLC |mi hm|\u03c8i = M 2 hn|\u03a8i .\n(4)\nm\n\n0\nThe eigenvalues {M 2 } of HLC = HLC\n+ VLC give the squared invariant masses of\nthe bound and continuum spectrum of the theory. The light-front Fock space is\nthe eigenstates of the free light-front Hamiltonian; i.e., it is a Hilbert space of nonm2 +k 2\ninteracting quarks and gluons, each of which satisfy k 2 = m2 and k \u2212 = k+ \u22a5 \u2265 0.\nThe projections {hn|\u03a8i} of the eigensolution on the n-particle Fock states provide\nthe light-front wavefunctions. Thus solving a quantum field theory is equivalent to\nsolving a coupled many-body quantum mechanical problem:\n\n\"\n\nn\nX\n\n2\nX\nm2 + k\u22a5\n\u03c8n =\nM \u2212\nxi\ni=1\nn\u2032\n2\n\n#\n\nZ\n\nhn|VLC |n\u2032 i \u03c8n\u2032\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the convolution and sum is understood over the Fock number, transverse momenta, plus momenta, and helicity of the intermediate states. Light-front wavefunctions are also related to momentum-space Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions by integrating over the relative momenta k \u2212 = k 0 \u2212 k z since this projects out the dynamics at\nx+ = 0.\nA review of the development of light-front quantization of QCD and other quantum field theories is given in the references.[30] The light-front quantization of gauge\ntheory can be most conveniently carried out in the light-cone gauge A+ = A0 +Az = 0.\nIn this gauge the A\u2212 field becomes a dependent degree of freedom, and it can be eliminated from the Hamiltonian in favor of a set of specific instantaneous light-front time\ninteractions. In fact in QCD(1 + 1) theory, this instantaneous interaction provides\n6\n\n\fthe confining linear x\u2212 interaction between quarks. In 3 + 1 dimensions, the transverse field A\u22a5 propagates massless spin-one gluon quanta with polarization vectors[21]\nwhich satisfy both the gauge condition \u01eb+\n\u03bb = 0 and the Lorentz condition k * \u01eb = 0.\nPrem Srivastava and I[31] have presented a new systematic study of light-frontquantized gauge theory in light-cone gauge using a Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion\nbased on light-front-time-ordered products. The Dirac bracket method is used to\nidentify the independent field degrees of freedom.[32] In our analysis one imposes the\nlight-cone gauge condition as a linear constraint using a Lagrange multiplier, rather\nthan a quadratic form. We then find that the LF-quantized free gauge theory simultaneously satisfies the covariant gauge condition \u2202 * A = 0 as an operator condition\nas well as the LC gauge condition. The gluon propagator has the form\nD\n\nE\n\n0| T (Aa\u03bc (x)Ab \u03bd (0)) |0 =\n\ni\u03b4 ab\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\nd4 k e\u2212ik*x\n\nD\u03bc\u03bd (k)\nk 2 + i\u01eb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we have defined\nD\u03bc\u03bd (k) = D\u03bd\u03bc (k) = \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd\n\nk2\nn\u03bc k\u03bd + n\u03bd k\u03bc\n\u2212\nn\u03bc n\u03bd .\n+\n(n * k)\n(n * k)2\n\n(7)\n\nHere n\u03bc is a null four-vector, gauge direction, whose components are chosen to be\nn\u03bc = \u03b4\u03bc + , n\u03bc = \u03b4 \u03bc \u2212 . Note also\nD\u03bc\u03bb (k)D \u03bb \u03bd (k) = D\u03bc\u22a5 (k)D \u22a5 \u03bd (k) = \u2212D\u03bc\u03bd (k),\nk \u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (k) = 0, n\u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (k) \u2261 D\u2212\u03bd (k) = 0,\nD\u03bb\u03bc (q) D \u03bc\u03bd (k) D\u03bd\u03c1 (q \u2032 ) = \u2212D\u03bb\u03bc (q)D \u03bc\u03c1 (q \u2032 ).\n\n(8)\n\nThe gauge field propagator i D\u03bc\u03bd (k)/(k 2 + i\u01eb) is transverse not only to the gauge\ndirection n\u03bc but also to k\u03bc , i.e., it is doubly-transverse. Thus D represents the polarization sum over physical propagating modes. The last term proportional to n\u03bc n\u03bd in\nthe gauge propagator does not appear in the usual formulations of light-cone gauge.\nHowever, in tree graph calculations it cancels against instantaneous gluon exchange\ncontributions.\nThe remarkable properties of (the projector) D\u03bd\u03bc greatly simplifies the computations of loop amplitudes. For example, the coupling of gluons to propagators carrying\nhigh momenta is automatic. In the case of tree graphs, the term proportional to n\u03bc n\u03bd\ncancels against the instantaneous gluon exchange term. However, in the case of loop\ndiagrams, the separation needs to be maintained so that one can identify the correct one-particle-irreducible contributions. The absence of collinear divergences in\nirreducible diagrams in the light-cone gauge greatly simplifies the leading-twist factorization of soft and hard gluonic corrections in high momentum transfer inclusive\nand exclusive reactions[21] since the numerators associated with the gluon coupling\nonly have transverse components.\n7\n\n\fThe interaction Hamiltonian of QCD in light-cone gauge can be derived by systematically applying the Dirac bracket method to identify the independent fields.[31]\nIt contains the usual Dirac interactions between the quarks and gluons, the threepoint and four-point gluon non-Abelian interactions plus instantaneous light-fronttime gluon exchange and quark exchange contributions\ni\n\nHint = \u2212g \u03c8 \u03b3 \u03bc A\u03bc ij \u03c8 j\ng\n+ f abc (\u2202\u03bc Aa \u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa \u03bc )Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd\n2\ng 2 abc ade\n+ f f Ab\u03bc Ad\u03bc Ac\u03bd Ae\u03bd\n4\n1\ng2 i\n\u2032\n\u2212 \u03c8 \u03b3 + (\u03b3 \u22a5 A\u22a5\u2032 )ij\n(\u03b3 \u22a5 A\u22a5 )jk \u03c8 k\n2\ni\u2202\u2212\n2\ng\n1\nj+\n\u2212 j +a\n2\n(\u2202\u2212 )2 a\nwhere\n\ni\n\nj + a = \u03c8 \u03b3 + (ta )ij \u03c8 j + fabc (\u2202\u2212 Ab\u03bc )Ac\u03bc .\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nThe renormalization constants in the non-Abelian theory have been shown [31]\nto satisfy the identity Z1 = Z3 at one-loop order, as expected in a theory with only\nphysical gauge degrees of freedom. The renormalization factors in the light-cone\ngauge are independent of the reference direction n\u03bc . The QCD \u03b2 function computed\nin the noncovariant LC gauge agrees with the conventional theory result.[33, 34]\nDimensional regularization and the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription[35, 36, 37]\nfor LC gauge were used to define the Feynman loop integrations.[38] There are no\nFaddeev-Popov or Gupta-Bleuler ghost terms.\nThe running coupling constant and the QCD \u03b2 function have also been computed\nat one loop in the doubly-transverse light-cone gauge.[31] It is also possible to effectively quantize QCD using light-front methods in covariant Feynman gauge.[39] It is\nwell-known that the light-cone gauge itself is not completely defined until one specifies\na prescription for the poles of the gauge propagator at n * k = 0. The MandelstamLiebbrandt prescription has the advantage of preserving causality and analyticity,\nas well as leading to proofs of the renormalizability and unitarity of Yang-Mills\ntheories.[40] The ghosts which appear in association with the Mandelstam-Liebbrandt\nprescription from the single poles have vanishing residue in absorptive parts, and thus\ndo not disturb the unitarity of the theory.\nA remarkable advantage of light-front quantization is that the vacuum state | 0i of\nthe full QCD Hamiltonian evidently coincides with the free vacuum. The light-front\nvacuum is effectively trivial if the interaction Hamiltonian applied to the perturbative\nvacuum is zero. Note that all particles in the Hilbert space have positive energy\nP\nk 0 = 21 (k + + k \u2212 ), and thus positive light-front k \u00b1 . Since the plus momenta ki+\n8\n\n\fis conserved by the interactions, the perturbative vacuum can only couple to states\nwith particles in which all ki+ = 0; i.e., so called zero-mode states. Bassetto and\ncollaborators[41] have shown that the computation of the spectrum of QCD(1 + 1) in\nequal time quantization requires constructing the full spectrum of non perturbative\ncontributions (instantons). In contrast, in the light-front quantization of gauge theory,\nwhere the k + = 0 singularity of the instantaneous interaction is defined by a simple\ninfrared regularization, one obtains the correct spectrum of QCD(1 + 1) without any\nneed for vacuum-related contributions. Zero modes of auxiliary fields are necessary\nto distinguish the theta-vacua of massless QED(1+1) [42, 43, 44], or to represent a\ntheory in the presence of static external boundary conditions or other constraints.\nZero-modes provide the light-front representation of spontaneous symmetry breaking\nin scalar theories.[45]\n\n3\n\nLight-Front Quantization of the Standard Model\n\nPrem Srivastava and I have also shown how light-front quantization can be applied to\nthe Glashow, Weinberg and Salam (GWS) model of electroweak interactions based on\nthe nonabelian gauge group SU(2)W \u00d7 U(1)Y .[46] This theory contains a nonabelian\nHiggs sector which triggers spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). A convenient\nway of implementing SSB and the (tree level) Higgs mechanism in the front form\ntheory was developed earlier by Srivastava.[47, 48, 49] One separates the quantum\nfluctuation fields from the corresponding dynamical bosonic condensate (or zerolongitudinal-momentum-mode) variables, before applying the Dirac procedure in order\nto construct the Hamiltonian formulation. The canonical quantization of LC gauge\nGWS electroweak theory in the front form can be derived by using the Dirac procedure\nto construct a self-consistent LF Hamiltonian theory. This leads to an attractive new\nformulation of the Standard Model of the strong and electroweak interactions which\ndoes not break the physical vacuum and has well-controlled ultraviolet behavior. The\nonly ghosts which appear in the formalism are the n * k = 0 modes of the gauge\nfield associated with regulating the light-cone gauge prescription. The massive gauge\nfield propagator has good asymptotic behavior in accordance with a renormalizable\ntheory, and the massive would-be Goldstone fields can be taken as physical degrees\nof freedom.\nFor example, consider the Abelian Higgs model. The interaction Lagrangian is\n1\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + |D\u03bc \u03c6|2 \u2212 V (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)\n4\n\n(11)\n\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc ,\n\n(12)\n\nV (\u03c6) = \u03bc2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 + \u03bb(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\nand\n\n9\n\n\fwith \u03bc2 < 0, \u03bb > 0. The complex scalar field \u03c6 is decomposed as\n1\n1\n\u03c6(x) = \u221a v + \u03c6(x) = \u221a [v + h(x) + i\u03b7(x)]\n2\n2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere v is the k + = 0 zero mode determined by the minimum of the potential:\n2\nv 2 = \u2212 \u03bc\u03bb , h(x) is the dynamical Higgs field, and \u03b7(x) is the Nambu-Goldstone field.\nThe quantization procedure determines \u2202 * A = MR, the 't Hooft condition. One can\nnow eliminate the zero mode component of the Higgs field v which gives masses for\nthe fundamental quantized fields. The A\u22a5 field then has mass M = ev and the Higgs\nfield acquires mass m2h = 2\u03bbv 2 = \u22122\u03bc2 .\nA new aspect of LF quantization, is that the third polarization of the quantized\nmassive vector field A\u03bc with four momentum k \u03bc has the form E\u03bc(3) = n\u03bc M/n * k. Since\nn2 = 0, this non-transverse polarization vector has zero norm. However, when one\nincludes the constrained interactions of the Goldstone particle, the effective longitu(3)\ndinal polarization vector of a produced vector particle is Eeff \u03bc = E\u03bc(3) \u2212 k\u03bc k * E (3) /k 2\nwhich is identical to the usual polarization vector of a massive vector with norm\n(3)\n(3)\nEeff * Eeff = \u22121. Thus, unlike the conventional quantization of the Standard Model,\nthe Goldstone particle only provides part of the physical longitudinal mode of the\nelectroweak particles.\nIn the LC gauge LF framework, the free massive gauge fields in the electroweak\ntheory satisfy simultaneously the 't Hooft conditions as an operator equation. The\nsum over the three physical polarizations is given by K\u03bc\u03bd\nK\u03bc\u03bd (k) =\n\nX\n\nE\u03bc(\u03b1) E\u03bd(\u03b1) = D\u03bc\u03bd (k) +\n\n(\u03b1)\n\n= \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd +\n\nM2\nn\u03bc n\u03bd\n(k + )2\n\n(15)\n\nn\u03bc k\u03bd + n\u03bd k\u03bc (k 2 \u2212 M 2 )\n\u2212\nn\u03bc n\u03bd\n(n * k)\n(n * k)2\n\nwhich satisfies: k \u03bc K\u03bc\u03bd (k) = (M 2 /k + ) n\u03bd and k \u03bc k \u03bd K\u03bc\u03bd (k) = M 2 . The free propagator of the massive gauge field A\u03bc is\nh0|T (A\u03bc (x)A\u03bd (y)) |0i =\nZ\ni\nK\u03bc\u03bd (k)\nd4 k 2\ne\u2212i k*(x\u2212y) .\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n(k \u2212 M 2 + i\u01eb)\n\n(16)\n\nIt does not have the bad high energy behavior found in the (Proca) propagator in the\nunitary gauge formulation, where the would-be Nambu-Goldstone boson is gauged\naway.\nIn the limit of vanishing mass of the vector boson, the gauge field propagator goes\nover to the doubly transverse gauge, (n\u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (k) = k \u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (k) = 0), the propagator\nfound [31] in QCD. The numerator of the gauge propagator K\u03bc\u03bd (k) also has important\n10\n\n\fsimplifying properties, similar to the ones associated with the projector D\u03bc\u03bd (k). The\ntransverse polarization vectors for massive or massless vector boson may be taken to\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n(k) \u2261 \u2212D\u22a5\n(k), whereas the non-transverse third one in the massive case is\nbe E(\u22a5)\nfound to be parallel to the LC gauge direction E\u03bc(3) (k) = \u2212(M/k + ) n\u03bc . Its projection\nalong the direction transverse to k\u03bc shares the spacelike vector property carried by\n\u03bc\n(k). The Goldstone boson or electroweak equivalence theorem becomes transparE(\u22a5)\nent in the LF formulation.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian of the Standard Model can be written in a compact\nform by retaining the dependent components A\u2212 and \u03c8\u2212 in the formulation. Its\nform closely resembles the interaction Hamiltonian of covariant theory, except for the\npresence of additional instantaneous four-point interactions. The resulting DysonWick perturbation theory expansion based on equal-LF-time ordering has also been\nconstructed, allowing one to perform higher-order computations in a straightforward\nfashion. The singularities in the noncovariant pieces of the field propagators may\nbe defined using the causal ML prescription for 1/k + when we employ dimensional\nregularization, as was shown in our earlier work on QCD. The power-counting rules\nin LC gauge then become similar to those found in covariant gauge theory.\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking is thus implemented in a novel way when one\nquantizes the Standard Model at fixed light-front time \u03c4 = x+ . In the general case,\nthe Higgs field \u03c6i (x) can be separated into two components:\n\u03c6i (\u03c4, x\u2212 , ~x\u22a5 ) = \u03c9i (\u03c4, ~x\u22a5 ) + \u03c6(\u03c4, x\u2212 , ~x\u22a5 ),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c9i is a classical k + = 0 zero-mode field and \u03c6 is the dynamical quantized field.\nHere i is the weak-isospin index. The zero-mode component is determined by solving\nthe Euler-Lagrange tree-level condition:\nVi\u2032 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u2202\u22a5 \u2202\u22a5 \u03c9i = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nA nonzero value for \u03c9i corresponds to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The nonzero\n\u03c9i couples to the gauge boson and Fermi fields through the Yukawa interactions of\nthe Standard Model. It can then be eliminated from the theory in favor of mass\nterms for the fundamental matter fields in the effective theory. The resulting masses\nare identical to those of the usual Higgs implementation of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking in the Standard Model.\nThe generators of isospin rotations are defined from the dynamical Higgs fields:\nGa = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\ndx\u22a5 dx\u2212 (\u2202\u2212 \u03c6)i (ta )ij \u03c6j .\n\n(19)\n\nNote that the weak-isospin charges and the currents corresponding to Ga are not\nconserved if the zero mode \u03c9i is nonzero since the cross terms in \u03c6, and \u03c9 are missing.\nThus [HLF , Ga ] 6= 0. Nevertheless, the charges annihilate the vacuum: Ga | 0iLF = 0,\n11\n\n\fsince the dynamical fields \u03c6i have no support on the LF vacuum, and all quanta have\npositive k + . Thus the LF vacuum remains equal to the perturbative vacuum; it is\nunaffected by the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nIn effect one can interpret the k + = 0 zero mode field \u03c9i as an x\u2212 -independent\nexternal field, analogous to an applied constant electric or magnetic field in atomic\nphysics. In this interpretation, the zero mode is a remnant of a Higgs field which\npersists from early cosmology; the LF vacuum however remains unchanged and unbroken.\n\n4\n\nNon-Perturbative Methods\n\nAs noted in section 2., solving a quantum field theory at fixed light-front time \u03c4 can\nbe formulated as a relativistic extension of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. If one\nimposes periodic boundary conditions in x\u2212 = t + z/c, then the + momenta become\nP\ndiscrete: ki+ = 2\u03c0\nn , P + = 2\u03c0\nK, where i ni = K.[50, 51] For a given \"harmonic\nL i\nL\nresolution\" K, there are only a finite number of ways a set of positive integers ni can\nsum to a positive integer K. Thus at a given K, the dimension of the resulting lightfront Fock state representation of the bound state is rendered finite without violating\nLorentz invariance. The eigensolutions of a quantum field theory, both the bound\nstates and continuum solutions, can then be found by numerically diagonalizing a\nframe-independent light-front Hamiltonian HLC on a finite and discrete momentumspace Fock basis. The continuum limit is reached for K \u2192 \u221e. This formulation\nof the non-perturbative light-front quantization problem is called \"discretized lightcone quantization\" (DLCQ).[51] The method preserves the frame-independence of the\nFront form.\nThe DLCQ method has been used extensively for solving one-space and one-time\ntheories[30], including applications to supersymmetric quantum field theories[52] and\nspecific tests of the Maldacena conjecture.[53] There has been progress in systematically developing the computation and renormalization methods needed to make\nDLCQ viable for QCD in physical spacetime. For example, John Hiller, Gary McCartor, and I [54, 55, 56] have shown how DLCQ can be used to solve 3+1 theories\ndespite the large numbers of degrees of freedom needed to enumerate the Fock basis.\nA key feature of our work is the introduction of Pauli Villars fields to regulate the UV\ndivergences and perform renormalization while preserving the frame-independence of\nthe theory. A recent application of DLCQ to a 3+1 quantum field theory with Yukawa\ninteractions is given in the references.[54] One can also define a truncated theory by\neliminating the higher Fock states in favor of an effective potential.[57, 58, 59] Spontaneous symmetry breaking and other nonperturbative effects associated with the\ninstant-time vacuum are hidden in dynamical or constrained zero modes on the lightfront. An introduction is given by McCartor and Yamawaki [60, 42]\nThe pion distribution amplitude has been computed using a combination of the\n12\n\n\fdiscretized DLCQ method for the x\u2212 and x+ light-front coordinates with a spatial\nlattice [61, 62, 63, 64] in the transverse directions. A finite lattice spacing a can be\nused by choosing the parameters of the effective theory in a region of renormalization group stability to respect the required gauge, Poincar\u00e9, chiral, and continuum\nsymmetries. Dyson-Schwinger models [65] can also be used to predict light-front\nwavefunctions and hadron distribution amplitudes by integrating over the relative k \u2212\nmomentum of the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions. Explicit nonperturbative light-front\nwavefunctions have been found in this way for the Wick-Cutkosky model, including\nspin-two states.[66] One can also implement variational methods, using the structure\nof perturbative solutions as a template for the numerator of the light-front wavefunctions.\n\n5\n\nA Light-Front Event Amplitude Generator\n\nThe light-front formalism can be used as an \"event amplitude generator\" for high\nenergy physics reactions where each particle's final state is completely labelled in\nmomentum, helicity, and phase. The application of the light-front time evolution operator P \u2212 to an initial state systematically generates the tree and virtual loop graphs\nof the T -matrix in light-front time-ordered perturbation theory in light-cone gauge.\nGiven the interactions of the light-front interaction Hamiltonian, any amplitude in\nQCD and the electroweak theory can be computed. For example, this method can be\nused to automatically compute the hard-scattering amplitudes TH for the deuteron\nform factor or pp elastic scattering.\nAt higher orders, loop integrals only involve integrations over the momenta of\nQ\nphysical quanta and physical phase space d2 k\u22a5i dki+ . Renormalized amplitudes can\nbe explicitly constructed by subtracting from the divergent loops amplitudes with\nnearly identical integrands corresponding to the contribution of the relevant mass\nand coupling counter terms \u2013 the \"alternating denominator method\".[67] The natural renormalization scheme to use for defining the coupling in the event amplitude\ngenerator is a physical effective charge such as the pinch scheme.[68] The argument of\nthe coupling is then unambiguous.[69] The DLCQ boundary conditions can be used to\ndiscretize the phase space and limit the number of contributing intermediate states\nwithout violating Lorentz invariance. Since one avoids dimensional regularization\nand nonphysical ghost degrees of freedom, this method of generating events at the\namplitude level could provide a simple but powerful tool for simulating events both\nin QCD and the Standard Model. Alternatively, one can construct the T \u2212matrix\nfor scattering in QCD using light-front quantization and the event amplitude generator; one can then probe its spectrum by finding zeros of the resolvant. It would\nbe particularly interesting to apply this method to finding the gluonium spectrum of\nQCD.\n13\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWork supported by the Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC0376SF00515.
