Gamma rays: bursts \u2013 Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal \u2013 ISM: structure\n\n1. Introduction\nOn the 4th of October 2002 at 12:06:13 UT, HETE II detected a burst of \u223c100 s duration (Shirasaki et al. 2002)\nwith a 7\u2013400 keV fluence of 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 erg cm\u22122 (Lamb\net al. 2002). The fast accurate localization allowed the\nrobotic telescope Oschin/NEAT to detect the optical afterglow (OA) \u223c9 minutes after the trigger (Fox 2002), at\nthe level of R = 15.52. Observations performed earlier by\nTorii et al. (2002) yielded upper limits around R \u223c 13.6,\n\u223c3.5 minutes after the trigger. The prompt OA identification allowed a very dense sampling of its light curve\nat early times (see the references listed in the caption of\nFig. 1), and spectroscopic observations at medium to high\nresolution (Matheson et al. 2002; M\u00f8ller et al. 2002; Fox\net al. 2002; Anupama et al. 2002; Eracleous et al. 2002;\nChornock & Filippenko 2002; Mirabal et al. 2002b; Sahu et\nal. 2002c; Salamanca et al. 2002; Djorgovski et al. 2002;\nSavaglio et al. 2002). The spectra revealed an emission\nline interpreted as Ly-\u03b1 at z = 2.328 and several absorption lines at slightly different redshifts, corresponding to\nvelocity differences up to 3000\u20134000 km s\u22121 , suggesting\nthat the absorbing material could be either a clumpy wind\nejected by a massive star progenitor or a clumpy remnant\nof a precursor supernova explosion (Salamanca et al. 2002;\nMirabal et al. 2002b). The X-ray afterglow (XA), observed\n\nby Chandra (Sako & Harrison 2002) decays in time as\nt\u22121\u00b10.2 with an average flux of 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nA preliminary spectral analysis shows no distinct features.\nThe peculiarity of this OA is the presence of a major rebrightening, with a rise time trise \u223c tstart where tstart is the\nmoment in which the rebrightening starts (see the central\npanel of Fig. 1). The flux then reconnects to the extrapola<\n<\ntion of the early time observations for 15 \u223c\nt\u223c\n100 hours\nafter the GRB. In this time span, the lightcurve shows at\nleast one (maybe two) additional bumps, but with smaller\ncontrast. Such a behavior is unprecedented and is not due\nto a calibration problem (Henden 2002b).\nIn the lightcurve of GRB 970508, a major rebrightening was observed from the optical to the X-rays (Galama\net al. 1998; Piro et al. 1998); in this case, however, after the\nrebrightening the flux remained larger than the extrapolation of the early time data and no additional feature was\ndetected for a long time. Such a behavior was interpreted\nas due to the impact of a late shell of the fireball that\ngave additional energy to the forward shock (Panaitescu\net al. 1998). In the case of GRB 000301C an achromatic\nrebrightening was observed. It had a very small time scale\ncompared to the time at which it took place and was consequently interpreted as due to a micro-lensing effect (Loeb\n& Perna 1998; Garnavich et al. 2000).\n\n\f2\n\nLazzati et al.: GRB 021004\n\nFig. 1. ISM model and fits to the R-band light curve of GRB 021004. The left panel shows the density model, with\nan enhancement at R \u223c 5 \u00d7 1017 cm. The dashed line shows the evolution of the Lorentz factor of the fireball. The\ncentral panel shows a compilation of R-band photometry from GCNs. The solid line shows the lightcurve predicted for\nthe density structure shown in the left panel, while the dashed line shows how the lightcurve would be in a uniform\nISM. The right panel shows an emphasized version of the central one, in which the lightcurve variability is enhanced\nby dividing the data and the model by the uniform ISM case (the dashed line in the central panel). A third bump\nmay be present at t \u223c 105 s, but we did not attempt to model it given the paucity of the data. In addition, further\ncomplications should be considered, since our model predicts the transit of the cooling break at t \u223c 2 d (possibly\n<\n<\nobserved by Matheson et al. 2002), and a jet break is expected to appear at 1.5 \u223c\nt\u223c\n10 d (Malesani et al. 2002).\nAll the times are in the rest frame of the GRB host, and no correction for reddening was applied. Magnitudes are\ncalculated using the calibration of Henden 2002a. Data from: Anupama et al. 2002; Balman et al. 2002; Barsukova et\nal. 2002; Bersier et al. 2002; Cool & Schaefer 2002; Di Paola et al. 2002; Fox 2002; Halpern et al. 2002a, 2002b; Holland\net al. 2002b, 2002c; Klotz & Boer 2002; Klotz et al. 2002; Malesani et al. 2002; Masetti et al. 2002; Matsumoto et\nal. 2002a, 2002b; Mirabal et al. 2002a, 2002b; Oksanen & Aho 2002; Oksanen et al. 2002; Sahu et al. 2002a, 2002b;\nStanek et al. 2002; Stefanon et al., 2002; Uemura et al. 2002; Weidinger et al. 2002; Winn et al. 2002; Zharikov et al.\n2002.\nIn this Letter we propose that the rebrightenings observed in the lightcurve of GRB 021004 are the result of\nthe interaction of the fireball with density enhancements\n(and possibly gaps) in the surrounding medium (Wang &\nLoeb 2000; Dai & Lu 2002). These inhomogeneities may\neither be in the form of spherical shells \u2013 possibly due to\ninstabilities in the wind ejection history of the progenitor\nstar \u2013 or of clumps and filaments \u2013 possibly associated\nto a cooling supernova remnant (SNR). This latter interpretation seems to be corroborated by multiwavelength\nphotometry and spectroscopy.\n\n2. The model\nWe applied a numerical code to compute the lightcurve.\nThe code takes fully into account the light traveltime effects, and assumes standard synchrotron emission equations to compute the comoving frame intensity\n(Panaitescu & Kumar 2000; Granot & Sari 2002). The fireball dynamics in a non uniform medium is treated by a\nnumerical integration of the energy and momentum conservation equations (Rhoads 1999; Kumar & Panaitescu\n2000), with the possibility of adding a reverse shock if a\nlarge density contrast is present.\nThe code assumes spherical symmetry for the environment properties and therefore we can model only radial\n\ninhomogeneities in the external medium. The results can\nbe extended to a clumpy geometry with simple considerations (see \u00a7 3). We did not include the detailed treatment\nof the fireball impact (Dai & Lu 2002) since the transient features that are predicted have a time scale much\nsmaller than that due to the curvature of the fireball and\nare therefore smeared out by the integration on the equal\narrival time surface.\nWhen the fireball impacts on an overdensity, it goes\nthrough a transient phase, in which the flux increases\nsharply, relaxing asymptotically to the solution for an unperturbed medium with the higher density (Sari & Piran\n1995). The effect of the interaction depends on the spectral range, on the radial dependence of the average density\n(wind or interstellar medium, hereafter ISM) and on the\ncooling regime of the electrons. Since the transitory increase is smeared out, the increase in the flux can be estimated with the asymptotic solution. In a uniform density\nISM for the slow cooling electron regime, an observation\nat a frequency above the cooling break will be insensitive\nto the density variation, while an observation between the\npeak (in F\u03bd vs \u03bd) and the cooling frequency will yield a flux\nincrease F1 /F0 \u221d (n1 /n0 )1/2 , where the subscripts 0 and\n1 refer to the smaller and larger densities, respectively. In\na wind environment, the same observation would depend\n\n\fLazzati et al.: GRB 021004\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Same as Fig. 1 but for a wind environment.\nlinearly on the density contrast. In the case of fast cooling electrons any observation above the peak frequency\nwill be insensitive on the density, both for the ISM and\nwind environments. In the radio band, the behavior can\nbe even more complicated, since below the self-absorption\nbreak the flux will decrease in response to a density increase, while above the self-absorption the flux will increase. Finally, the situation can be made even more complicated by the fact that the break frequencies are shifted\nby the overdensity and may cross the observational band\nduring the rebrightening.\nAs mentioned above, if the fireball bumps up against a\ndensity jump, a reflected (as well as a forward) shock can\nbe generated, which propagates back into the hot relativistic shell. Its capability of modifying the fireball dynamics\ndepends on the density contrast n1 /n0 . If n1 /n0 > 250\nthe bulk Lorentz factor of the reverse shocked hot shell is\nsignificantly (\u223c 0.3) lower than that of the unshocked hot\nshell (at a fixed radius), since the relative Lorentz factor\nof the two shells is \u0393rel > 2. Therefore such a relativistic reverse shock substantially slows down the incoming\nfireball, converting most of the initial kinetic energy into\ninternal energy. Its contribution to the emission must be\ntaken into account. This is not the case with GRB 021004:\nthe fireball encounters smaller density contrasts (see below\nand the left panels of Figs. 1 and 2) and the hot shell continues its run with an asymptotically almost unchanged\nLorentz factor. Therefore in the following we will neglect\nany contribution from the reverse shock emission.\n\n3. Results\nFigures 1 and 2 show our model in the cases of an ISM\nand wind environment, respectively. Let us first discuss\nthe wind case in Fig. 2, which we consider less likely.\nAs discussed above, a requirement in order to observe\na rebrightening in a given band (R in our case) is that the\nelectrons must be in the slow cooling regime and the band\nmust lie between the peak and cooling frequencies. Such a\nconstraint is easily fulfilled in a wind environment, since\nthe cooling frequency increases with time. Under these\n\nconditions, the lightcurve should decay as a power law\nwith an index1 \u03b4w = (p + 8)/8 where p is the powerlaw index of the electron distribution [n(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212p ] and\n\u03b4w is defined through F (t) \u221d t\u2212\u03b4 . The fitted lightcurve\ndecay is \u03b4 \u223c 0.75, which would imply an unphysical distribution with p < 0. In addition (see Fig. 2) the density\nenhancements take place at a fairly large distance from\nthe progenitor star, when the wind density is very small\n(n \u223c 0.3 cm\u22123 ). In these conditions, a more complicated\ndensity structure, due to the interaction of the wind with\nthe ISM, would be expected (Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2001).\nWe consider the case of a uniform environment more\nlikely. In this case, the relation between the temporal decay of the OA and the electron distribution is \u03b4ISM =\n3(p \u2212 1)/4, yielding p \u2248 2. This value is theoretically\nacceptable, and is comparable to the values derived in\nother afterglows (Panaitescu & Kumar 2002). Moreover,\nit is consistent with the X-ray spectrum and temporal decay detected by Chandra at later times (Sako & Harrison\n2002), if the X-ray band lies above the cooling frequency.\nAgain, this is usual in observed XAs (see e.g. GRB 010222,\nin't Zand et al. 2002). The required density contrast to explain the bump is: n1 /n0 \u2248 8.5 (Fig. 1).\nThe density of the ISM and the other afterglow parameters can be constrained by requiring that the optical\nR band lies between the peak and cooling frequencies and\nthat the OA flux is consistent with observations. Such a\nprocedure yields a moderately low density, n \u223c 1 cm\u22123 ,\nof the uniform part of the environment. For the fit shown\nin Fig. 1 we also assumed an electron energy fraction\n\u01ebe = 0.01, a magnetic field energy fraction \u01ebB = 0.001,\nand an efficiency of converting the kinetic energy of the\nfireball into photons during the prompt phase of \u03b7 = 5%.\nIt should be emphasized, however, that modeling with the\nstandard afterglow theory is sensitive to some simplistic\nassumptions about the shock physics and about the magnetic field generation mechanisms (see, e.g., Rossi & Rees\n1\n\nThis relation holds if p < 2 (Dai & Cheng 2001). We use it\nsince the p > 2 relation \u03b4w = (3p \u2212 1)/4 yields inconsistently\np = 1.35.\n\n\f4\n\nLazzati et al.: GRB 021004\n\n2002). Due to the lack of a complete broad-band coverage\nof the lightcurve, a larger density could be envisaged. A\nrobust upper limit to the average density can however be\nset by considering that a non-relativistic transition was\nnot observed several days after the explosion. This yields\nn \u2264 106 cm\u22123 . It should also be mentioned that, even\nthough all the magnitudes are corrected for the comparison star discussed by Henden (2002b), the data we are\nattempting to model have been taken with different telescopes and therefore absolute values and errors should be\ntaken with caution. In addition, significant fast variability\nwas detected (Halpern et al. 2002a). For these reasons we\ndid not attempt to perform a formal fit to the data set,\nbut rather to reproduce its general behavior. We also did\nnot try to model the very small time scale variability of\nthe lightcurve, which may be produced by small scale ISM\nturbulence as in GRB 011211 (Holland et al. 2002a).\nWhat can be safely concluded from the observed rise\ntime is that the overdensity lays at a distance R \u223c 5 \u00d7\n1017 (E54 /n)1/4 cm from the explosion centre, a value that\nis fairly independent of the assumed density. Interestingly,\nthe value of the Lorentz factor at the beginning of the interaction is even more robustly constrained, being \u03931 \u223c\n50 (E54 /n)1/8 . This, together with the fact that we can\nreproduce the bump shape with a spherical overdensity\n(we do not see the edges of the clump), allows us to put\n> 1\u25e6 .\na lower limit to the angular size of the clump \u03b81 \u223c\nInterestingly, the Gaussian density enhancement we used\nhas a radial width \u03b4R/R = 0.04, comparable to the inferred lower limit on the angular size. Two more considerations support the idea that the density structure is indeed\nclumpy rather than made by under and over-dense shells.\nFirst, we had to include in the radial density structure an\nunder-dense part, due to the need of reproducing at best\nthe decaying part of the first enhancement. The same behavior can be due to a clump that has an angular size similar to the relativistic beaming of the fireball (\u03b8 \u223c 1/\u0393). As\nsoon as the fireball is slowed down by the interaction with\nthe clump, the edges of the clump can be detected, with\na corresponding decrease of flux. Secondly, the luminosity\nratio of the second (and possibly the third) bump with\nrespect to the underlying power-law is smaller than the\ncontrast of the first bump (see right panel of Fig. 1). Our\nradial overdensity had therefore to be smaller (see Fig. 1).\nHowever, should a clump with the same overdensity and\nsize of the first one be present at a larger distance, it would\nproduce a bump in the lightcurve with a flux increase of a\nfactor R2 \u2248 1+R1 (\u03932 /\u03931 )2 , where R1 is the flux ratio for\nthe main bump and \u03932 < \u03931 is the Lorentz factor of the\nfireball at the moment of the interaction with the second\nclump. This is due to the fact that the second bump would\ninteract with a smaller portion of the visible area of the\nfireball. The predicted ratio is (\u03931 /\u03932 )2 \u2248 7 (left panel of\nFig. 1), in excellent agreement with the data (right panel\nof Fig. 1). As a consequence, the lightcurve should evolve\nto a smooth decay due to (i) the smaller area of the visible\nfireball that would be affected by the interaction with a\n\nclump and (ii) the possibility of interaction with more and\nmore clumps simultaneously.\nWe therefore conclude that the most likely environment for GRB 021004 is a uniform medium with clumps\nof density contrast of order 10 and size \u2206R \u223c 1016 cm.\nSuch an environment may be quite typical for relatively\nyoung SNRs (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2002). This evidence adds\nto the multiple high velocity absorption systems detected\nin the optical spectra (Salamanca et al. 2002), suggesting that the explosion of the burst took place within the\nremnant of a former explosion, likely a SN.\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nWe have presented a model to fit the OA of GRB 021004,\nwhich is characterized by the presence of bright bumps\non top of the usual power-law decay. We suggest that\nthe most likely origin for the bumps is the interaction of\nthe fireball with density clumps, with a density contrast\nn1 /n2 \u223c 10 and size \u2206R \u223c 1016 cm. These clumps should\nlie at a distance of the order of \u223c 5 \u00d7 1017 cm from the\nexplosion site, even though this number is uncertain due\nto the lack of a precise measure of the average density of\nthe environment.\nOne possible alternative to this explanation is the\npresence of a very narrow and energetic component of\nthe fireball, lying slightly off-axis from the line of sight\n(Panaietscu et al. 1998). In this case such a bump should\nbe a common feature of all OAs that an unprecedented\nearly monitoring has now disclosed. Such a component,\nwas however not seen in GRB 990123. In addition, the\nequality of tstart with the rise time trise would be a mere\ncoincidence. It would also be difficult to explain the second (and possible third) rebrightening. Alternatively, the\nbump may be produced by a neutron decay trail ahead\nof the external shock (Beloborodov 2002). Again, a single\nbump would be expected in the simplest case.\nEvidence for a clumpy geometry of the medium surrounding the GRB explosion site comes also from the detection, in the optical spectra, of multiple absorption features from intermediate ionization ions (e.g. CIV). The\nlarge velocity spacing of \u223c 3000 km/s, suggests a clumpy\nmedium outflowing from the explosion site (Mirabal et\nal. 2002; Salamanca et al. 2002). The possible physical association of the absorbing clouds with those producing the afterglow rebrightenings is tantalizing, even\nthough the former should lie at a larger distance, since\nall the carbon atoms are completely ionized within a dis> 1019 cm from the explosion site (a density of\ntance R \u223c\n7\n\u223c 10 cm\u22123 would be required to have recombination of\nfree electrons onto the carbon nuclei in \u223c 1 day).\nWe speculate that the burst exploded within a Crablike SNR, produced by a supernova that exploded 10\u2212100\nyears before the GRB. Such a time interval is in the upper extreme, yet consistent, with what predicted by the\nSupranova scenario (Vietri & Stella 1998). This possibility\nwas also suggested to account for the possible detections\nof X-ray lines (Piro et al. 1999, 2000; Antonelli et al. 2000;\n\n\fLazzati et al.: GRB 021004\n\nReeves et al. 2002) in the early XA of several GRBs. In\nthose cases, the SN-GRB delay should have been smaller\n(Lazzati et al. 1999, 2002). Consistently, no X-ray feature\nis detected in the X-ray spectrum of GRB 021004 (Sako &\nHarrison 2002) since the remnant is too far from the explosion site and its density too small. Also, the outflow velocity of the SNR inferred for this burst is much smaller than\nthat required in bursts with X-ray features, consistent\nwith the slow-down of the SN ejecta with time. Finally,\nif this interpretation is correct, the OA of GRB 021004\nshould not have a SN component in its lightcurve (see,\ne.g., Bloom et al. 2002), even though such a component\nwould be in any case difficult to detect given the large\nredshift of the event.\nAcknowledgements.
