Introduction and Preliminaries\nAlgebras, coalgebras and Hopf algebras are some of the interesting objects with\nstructure in representation categories of commutative rings. In the representation\ncategory of a noncommutative ring, these objects become ring extensions, corings\nand Hopf algebroids. Some basic algebras of interest are the cohomological dimension 0 and \u221e cases of separable algebra and Frobenius algebra; which become\nseparable extensions and Frobenius extensions in noncommutative representation\ntheory. Also, QF rings, semisimple rings, and Azumaya algebras generalize to ring\nextensions; however depth is not such a notion, originating as a tool of induced\nrepresentation theory. Depth is essentially constant on (especially projective) algebras over a commutative ring, but gives different and interesting outcomes for ring\nextensions.\nThe depth of many subgroups are recently computed, both as induced complex\nrepresentations [6] and as induced representations over general commutative rings of\ngroup algebras [1]. For example, the depth of the permutation groups Sn \u2282 Sn+1 is\n2n\u22121 over any ground ring and depends only on a combinatorial depth of subgroups\ndefined in terms of bisets in [1]. The authors of [1] show that combinatorial depth\ndc (H, G) of a subgroup H in a finite group G satisfies dc (H, G) \u2264 2n for n \u2265 1\n(respectively, dc (H, G) \u2264 2n \u2212 1 for n > 1) \u21d4 for any x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 G, there is\nn\u22121\n= H \u2229i=1\nyi Hyi\u22121 (respectively, the\ny1 , . . . , yn\u22121 \u2208 G such that H \u2229ni=1 xi Hx\u22121\ni\n\u22121\n\u22121\nlatter condition and additionally x1 hx1 = y1 hy1 , all h \u2208 H \u2229ni=1 xi Hx\u22121\ni ). All\nnotions of depth \u2264 2 are the same and occur precisely if H is a normal subgroup.\nHowever, depth of subalgebras over base rings (of varying characteristic denoted\nby a subscript) for R = k[G] and S = k[H] and combinatorial depth diverge in a\nIn memory of Gerhard Hochschild.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLARS KADISON\n\nstring of inequalities given in [1] as follows:\n(1)\n\nd0 (H, G) \u2264 dp (H, G) \u2264 dZ (H, G) \u2264 dc (H, G) \u2264 2[G : NG (H)].\n\nAlso dk (H, G) \u2264 dc (H, G) showing that all extensions of finite dimensional group\nalgebras have finite depth.\nThe authors begin in [1] with a new notion of subring depth d(S, R), given below\nin (4). They show in an appendix how it is based on and equal to a previous notion\nwhere S and R are semisimple complex algebras given below in (5). Such a pair R \u2287\nS is a special case of (split separable) Frobenius extensions; in Theorem 5.3 below\nwe show that subring depth is equal to tower depth of Frobenius extensions [15]\nsatisfying a generator module condition. The authors of [1] define a left and right\neven depth and show these are the same on group algebra extensions; Theorem 3.4\nbelow shows this equality holds for all QF extensions.\nIn this paper an obvious change is made to the definition of subring depth; we\ndefine an I-depth dI (S \u2192 R) of a ring homomorphism S \u2192 R with R-bimodule I,\nwhich we use in place of R in the n-fold tensor products over S in the definition (4)\nof d(S, R) (as well as a converse, automatic in the presence of units). When I is an\nideal of a semisimple complex algebra R with semisimple subalgebra S the I-depth\ndI (S \u2192 R) gives a lower bound, dI (S \u2192 R) \u2264 d(S, R) discussed in Section 2 in\nterms of the part of the bipartite graph of the inclusion which is directly below the\nideal I.\nThere are tantalizing similarities and intriguing relations between relative homological algebra and the subring depth definition and theory. For example, the\ndepth two condition on a subring S \u2286 R leads in [14] to an isomorphism of differential graded algebras between the relative Hochschild R-valued cochains with\ncup product and the Amitsur complex of a coring with grouplike element (on the\nendomorphism ring End S RS over the centralizer subring RS ). Also the paper [16]\ncontains some relations between depth 2 and notions of relative homological algebra\ncarried over to corings in [4]. The tower of iterated endomorphism rings above a ring\nextension becomes in the case of Frobenius extensions a tower of rings on the bar\nresolution groups Cn (R, S) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) with Frobenius and Temperley-Lieb\nstructures explicitly calculated from their more usual iterative definition in Section 4.1. At the same time Frobenius extensions of depth more than 2 are known to\nhave depth 2 further out in the tower: we extend this observation in [15] with new\nproofs to include other ring extensions satisfying the hypotheses of Proposition 4.3.\n1.1. H-equivalent modules. Let R be a ring. Two left R-modules, R N and R M ,\nh\nare said to be h-equivalent, denoted by R M \u223c R N if two conditions are met. First,\nfor some positive integer r, N is isomorphic to a direct summand in the direct sum\nof r copies of M , denoted by\n(2)\n\nRN\n\n\u2295\u2217\u223c\n= RM r\n\n\u21d4\n\nN | Mr \u21d4\n\n\u2203fi \u2208 Hom (R M, R N ), gi \u2208 Hom (R N, R M ), i = 1, . . . , r :\n\nr\nX\n\nfi \u25e6 gi = idN\n\ni=1\n\nSecond, symmetrically there is s \u2208 Z + such that M | N s . It is easy to extend this\ndefinition of h-equivalence (sometimes referred to as similarity) to h-equivalence of\ntwo objects in an abelian category, and to show that it is an equivalence relation.\n\n\fIDEAL DEPTH OF QF EXTENSIONS\n\n3\n\nh\n\nIf two modules are h-equivalent, R N \u223c R M , then they have Morita equivalent\nendomorphism rings, EN := End R N and EM := End R M . This is quite easy to\nsee since a Morita context of bimodules are given by H(M, N ) := Hom (R M, R N ),\nwhich is an EN -EM -bimodule via composition, and the bimodule EM H(N, M )EN ;\nthese are progenerator modules, by applying to (2) or its reverse, M | N s , any of\nthe four Hom-functors such as Hom (R \u2212, R M ) from the category of left R-modules\ninto the category of left EM -modules showing that EM H(N, M ) is finite projective;\nsimilarly, generator. Then the explicit conditions on mappings for h-equivalence\nshow that H(M, N ) \u2297EM H(N, M ) \u2192 EN and the reverse mapping given by composition are both bimodule isomorphisms as required. Since EM and EN are Morita\nequivalent rings, their centers are isomorphic:\nEnd R ME \u223c\n= End R NE .\nN\n\nM\n\nh\n\nThe theory of h-equivalent modules applies to bimodules T MS \u223c T NS by letting\nR = T \u2297Z S op which sets up an equivalence of abelian categories between T -Sbimodules and left R-modules. Two additive functors F, G : C \u0592\u2192 D are h-equivalent\nif there are natural split epis F (X)n \u2192 G(X) and G(X)m \u2192 F (X) for all X in C.\nWe leave the proof of the lemma below as an elementary exercise.\nh\n\nLemma 1.1. Suppose two R-modules are h-equivalent, M \u223c N and two additive\nh\nfunctors from R-modules to an abelian category are h-equivalent, F \u223c G. Then\nh\nF (M ) \u223c G(N ).\nh\n\nFor example, the following substitution in equations involving the \u223c -equivalence\nrelation follows from the lemma:\n(3)\n\nR PT\n\nh\n\n\u223c\n\nR QT\n\nT US\n\nh\n\n\u223c\n\nT VS\n\n\u21d2\n\nRP\n\nh\n\n\u2297 T US \u223c\n\nRQ\n\n\u2297T VS\n\nExample 1.2. If R is a semisimple artinian ring with simples {P1 , . . . , Pt } (representatives from each isomorphism class), all finitely generated modules MR and NR\nhave a unique factorization into simple components. Denote the simple constituents\nof MR by Simples (M ) = {Pi | [Pi , M ] 6= 0} where [Pi , M ] is the number of factors in\nM isomorphic to Pi . Then M | N q for some positive q if Simples (M ) \u2286 Simples (N );\nh\n\nand M \u223c N iff Simples (M ) = Simples (N ).\nSuppose R has central primitive idempotents e1 , . . . , et such that each [Pi , ei R] =\nni , so that R decomposes into the product of matrix rings over each of the division\nrings Di := End (Pi )R : R \u223c\n= Mn1 (D1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Mnt (Dt ). If M and N are hequivalent f.g. R-modules, then the endomorphism rings EM and EN are explicitly\nMorita equivalent as they are both products of matrix rings over the same subset\nof division rings D1 , . . . , Dt .\nExample 1.3. Via some more category theory, we may see that positive integers\nn and m are h-equivalent if n | mr and m | ns for some positive integers r, s; whence\nthere are primes p1 , . . . , pk such that n and m lie in the same h-equivalence class\n{pr11 * * * prkk | r1 , . . . , rk \u2265 1}. This explains the notation for eq. (2).\n1.2. Depth two. A subring pair S \u2286 R is said to have left depth 2 (or be a left\nh\ndepth two extension [13]) if R \u2297S R \u223c R as natural S-R-bimodules. Right depth\n2 is defined similarly in terms of h-equivalence of natural R-S-bimodules. In [13] it\nwas noted that the left condition implies the right and conversely if R is a Frobenius\n\n\f4\n\nLARS KADISON\n\nextension of S. Also in [13] a Galois theory of Hopf algebroids was defined on the\nendomorphism ring H := End S RS as total ring and the centralizer C := RS as\nbase ring. The antipode is the restriction of the natural anti-isomorphism stemming\nfrom following the arrows,\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nEnd RS \u2212\u2192 R \u2297S R \u2212\u2192 (End S R)op .\nThe Galois properties may then be summarized by the invariants under the\nobvious action of H, RH = S if RS is faithfully flat, and End RS \u223c\n= R#H a smash\nproduct product ring structure on R \u2297C H: the details are in [13]. There is also\na duality structure by going a step further along in the tower above S \u2286 R \u0592\u2192\nEnd RS \u0592\u2192 End R \u2297S RR , where the dual Hopf algebroid H \u2032 := (R \u2297S R)S plays a\nrole [13].\nConversely, Galois extensions have depth 2, which is most easily seen from the\nGalois map of an H-comodule algebra A with invariant subalgebra B and finite\n\u223c\n=\ndimensional Hopf algebra H over a base field k, which is given by A \u2297B A \u2212\u2192\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndim\nH\nA \u2297k H, a \u2297 a 7\u2192 a a(0) \u2297 a(1) , whence A \u2297B A \u223c\nas A-B-bimodules.\n= A\nThe Hopf subalgebras within a finite dimensional Hopf algebra which have depth\n2 are precisely the normal Hopf subalgebras; if normal, it has depth 2 by applying\nthe Hopf-Galois observation just made. The converse follows from an argument\ndiscovered by [2, Boltje-K\u00fclshammer] which divides the normality notion into right\nand left just like depth 2, where left normal is invariance under the left adjoint\naction. Note their argument given in the context of any augmented algebra A\n(such as a quasi-Hopf algebra) next. Let \u03b5 : A \u2192 k be the algebra homomorphism\ninto a base ring k. Let A+ denote ker \u03b5, and for a subalgebra B \u2286 A, let B + denote\nker \u03b5 \u2229 B. For example, it may be shown that if a (quasi-)Hopf algebra H has left\nnormal (quasi-)Hopf subalgebra, then HK + \u2286 K + H.\nProposition 1.4. Suppose B \u2286 A is a subalgebra of an augmented algebra. If\nB \u2286 A has right depth 2, then AB + \u2286 B + A.\nProof. To A\u2297B A | Aq as A-B-bimodules, apply the additive functor k\u03b5 \u2297A \u2212, which\nresults in A/B + A | k q as right B-modules. The annihilator of k q restricted to B is\nof course B + , which then also annihilates A/B + A, so AB + \u2286 B + A.\n\u0003\nThe opposite inclusion is of course satisfied by a left depth 2 extension of augmented algebras.\nAlso subalgebra pairs of semisimple complex algebras have depth 2 exactly when\nthey are normal in a classical sense of Rieffel. We note the theorem in [6] below\nand give a new proof in one direction along the lines of the previous proposition.\nTheorem 1.5. [6, Theorem 4.6] Suppose B \u2286 A is a subalgebra pair of semisimple\ncomplex algebras. Then B \u2286 A has depth 2 if and only if for every maximal ideal\nI in A, one has A(I \u2229 B) = (I \u2229 B)A.\nProof. (\u21d0) See [6, Section 4]. (\u21d2) Given maximal ideal I in A, there is an ideal\nJ with identity element 1J such that A = I \u2295 J, and algebra homomorphism\n\u03b5 : A \u2192 A/I \u223c\n= J.

Thus AB \u2286 B + A. The opposite inclusion follows from a similar\nargument applied to the left depth 2 condition.\n\u0003\nP\n\n2. Ideal depth of a ring homomorphism\nLet S and R be unital associative rings and S \u2192 R a ring homomorphism where\n1S 7\u2192 1R . Suppose R IR is a bimodule. With no further ado, we will restrict I to\nbimodules S IR , R IS or S IS via the homomorphism S \u2192 R. Note that the kernel\nof S \u2192 R is contained in the annihilator ideal in S of the left (or right) S-module\nI denoted by ann S I.\nWe let C0I (S \u2192 R) = S, and for n \u2265 1,\nCnI (S \u2192 R) = I \u2297S * * * \u2297S I\n\n(n times I)\n\nCnI (S\n\nFor n \u2265 1, the\n\u2192 R) has a natural R-R-bimodule (briefly R-bimodule)\nstructure which restricts to S-R-, R-S- and S-bimodule structures occuring in the\nnext definition.\nDefinition 2.1. The ring homomorphism S \u2192 R has I-depth 2n + 1 \u2265 1 if as\nh\nI\nS-bimodules CnI (S \u2192 R) \u223c Cn+1\n(S \u2192 R). The ring homomorphism S \u2192 R has\nh\n\nI\n(S \u2192 R) as S-R-bimodules\nleft (right) I-depth 2n \u2265 2 if CnI (S \u2192 R) \u223c Cn+1\n(respectively, R-S-bimodules).\n\nIt is clear that if S \u2192 R has either I-depth 2n, it has I-depth 2n+1 by restricting\nthe h-equivalence condition to S-bimodules. If it has I-depth 2n + 1, it has I-depth\n2n + 2 by tensoring the h-equivalence by \u2212 \u2297S I or I \u2297S \u2212. The minimum I-depth\nis denoted by dI (S \u2192 R).\nNote that the minimum left and right minimum even I-depths may differ by 2\n(in which case dI (S \u2192 R) is the least of the two). In the next section we provide\na general condition, which includes a Hopf subalgebra pair S \u2286 R of symmetric\nFrobenius algebras with I an ideal in R, where the left and right minimum even\nI-depths coincide.\nI\nWe also remark that once S \u2192 R has I-depth 2n + 1 the Cn+m\n(S \u2192 R)'s\nstop growing as m \u2192 \u221e in terms of adding new indecomposables in a category\nh\nI\nof modules with unique factorization, since CnI (S \u2192 R) \u223c Cn+m\n(S \u2192 R) for all\nm \u2265 0 (see the example in the previous section). This corresponds well with the\nclassical notion of finite depth in subfactor theory.\nLemma 2.2. Let S \u2192 R have kernel K, S := S/K and S \u0592\u2192 R be the induced ring\nmonomorphism. Then the left or right minimum depth dI (S \u2192 R) = dI (S \u0592\u2192 R)\nunless dI (S \u0592\u2192 R) = 1, in which case equality holds if the quotient homomorphism\np : S \u2192 S has a section.\nProof. Note that if MR | NRq , then ann NR \u2286 ann MR . Since K is in ann CnI (R, S)\nh\nfor all n \u2265 1 and CnI (R, S) \u223c\n= CnI (R, S) as S-modules, it follows that CnI (R, S) \u223c\n\n\f6\n\nLARS KADISON\nh\n\nI\nI\n(R, S) for the bimodules at issue. The conCn+1\n(R, S) implies CnI (R, S) \u223c Cn+1\nverse is easy by pullback along p.\nS \u2192 R has I-depth 1 iff there are central\nelements wj , zi \u2208 I S and\nP\nP mappings\nfj , gi \u2208 Hom (S IS , S SS ) such that x = i zi gi (x) for all x \u2208 I and j fj (wj ) =\n1S . By composing with the quotient homomorphism S \u2192 S, we obtain f \u0303j , g\u0303i \u2208\nP\nP\nHom (S IS , S S S ) and zi \u2208 I S such that x = i g\u0303i (x)zi and j f \u0303j (wj ) = 1S . The\nconverse may be proven with the extra hypothesis in the lemma, since all mappings\nin Hom (S IS , S S S ) have a lifting to Hom (S IS , S SS ) along p via a section \u03c3 : S \u0592\u2192 S\nsatisfying p \u25e6 \u03c3 = idS .\n\u0003\n\nExample 2.3. Suppose S is a subring of R (where 1S = 1R ). Let S \u2192 R be\nthe inclusion monomorphism and I = R, the natural R-bimodule. The minimum\ndepth of the subring S \u2286 R as defined in [1, Boltje-Danz-K\u00fclshammer] is denoted\nby d(S, R). We note that d(S, R) = dR (S \u0592\u2192 R). In fact, CnR (S \u2192 R) = R \u2297S\n* * * \u2297S R := Cn (R, S) (n times R) for n > 0, and the depth 2n + 1 condition in [1]\nis that\n(4)\n\nCn+1 (R, S) | Cn (R, S)q\n\nas S-bimodules (some q \u2208 Z + ). The left depth 2n condition in [1] is (4) more\nstrongly as natural S-R-bimodules (and as R-S-bimodules for the right depth 2n\ncondition). But (using a pair of classical face and degeneracy maps of homological\nalgebra) we always have Cn (R, S) | Cn+1 (R, S) as R-S-, S-R- or S-bimodules, so\nthat the depth 2n as well as 2n + 1 conditions coincide in the case of subring with\nthe I-depth 2n and 2n + 1 conditions above where I = R. (Note though that\nR-depth 1 is slightly stronger than subring depth 1 since R is not just centrally\nprojective over S (i.e., R | S q as S-bimodules) but also R is a split extension of S\nas S-bimodules since S | Rq implies S | R; the split extension condition is satisfied\nby all group algebra extensions and subfactor examples of finite depth.)\nExample 2.4. Let S \u2286 R be a subring pair of semisimple complex algebras.\nThen the minimum depth d(S, R) may be computed from the inclusion matrix M ,\nalternatively an n by m induction-restriction table of n S-simples induced to nonnegative integer linear combination of m R-simples along rows, and by Frobenius\nreciprocity, columns show restriction of R-simples in terms of S-simples). The\nprocedure to obtain d(S, R) given in the paper [6] is the following: let M [2n] =\n(M M t )n and M [2n+1] = M [2n] M (and M [0] = In ), then the matrix M has depth\nn \u2265 1 if for some q \u2208 Z +\n(5)\n\nM [n+1] \u2264 qM [n\u22121]\n\nThe minimum depth of M is equal to d(S, R) by [1, appendix] (or Theorem 5.3\nbelow combined with [5, 6]).\nIn terms of the bipartite graph of the inclusion S \u2286 R, d(S, R) is the lesser of\nthe minimum odd depth and the minimum even depth [6]. The matrix M is an\nincidence matrix of this bipartite graph if all entries greater than 1 are changed\nto 1, while zero entries are retained as 0: let the S-simples be represented by n\nwhite dots in a bottow row of the graph, and R-simples by m black dots in a top\nrow, connected by edges joining black and white dots (or not) according to the 01-matrix entries obtained from M . The minimum odd depth of the bipartite graph\nis 1 plus the diameter in edges of the row of white dots (indeed an odd number),\n\n\fIDEAL DEPTH OF QF EXTENSIONS\n\n7\n\nwhile the minimum even depth is 2 plus the largest of the diameters of the bottom\nrow where a subset of black dots under one white dot is identified together.\nNow suppose I is an ideal in R. Let the primitive central idempotents of R\nbe given by e1 , . . . , em and those of S by f1 , . . . , fn . Then I is itself a semisimple\ncomplex algebra with unit e = e1 + * * * + er (assumed with no loss of generality).\nNow suppose fi ej = 0 for i > s and all j \u2264 r, while fi ej 6= 0 for i \u2264 s and some\nj \u2264 r. Let J = f1 S \u2295 * * * \u2295 fs S, a semisimple subalgebra of S: this ideal satisfies\nJ \u2295 ann (S I) = S. Then it is not hard to see that I-depth of S \u2286 R is computed as\nthe depth of the subring pair of semisimple algebras J \u0592\u2192 I via s 7\u2192 es:\n(6)\n\ndI (S, R) = d(J, I),\n\nthe minimum depth of the s \u00d7 r submatrix M1 in the upper lefthand corner of M .\nThis follows from the lemma where S/K = J and the realization that I \u2297J * * * \u2297J I\nis induction and restriction n times of I-simples as explained in the appendix of [1].\nExample 2.5. As a sub-example of the previous example, let R = C S4 , the\ncomplex group algebra of the permutation group on four letters, and S = C S3 . The\ninclusion diagram pictured below with the degrees of the irreducible representations,\nis determined from the character tables of S3 and S4 or the branching rule (for the\nYoung diagrams labelled by the partitions of n and representing the irreducibles of\nSn ).\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u0005 \u25e6 999\n\u0005 \u25e6 999\n\u0005\n\u0005\n9\n9\n\u0005\n\u0005\n99\n99\n\u0005\n\u0005\n99 \u0005\u0005\u0005\n99\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\n\u2022\u0005\n\u2022\u0005\n\u2022\n1\n2\n1\nThis graph has minimum odd depth 5 and minimum even depth 6, whence d(S, R) =\n5. Alternatively, the inclusion matrix M is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 1 0 0 0\nM =\uf8ed 0 1 1 1 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 1 1\nwhose bracketed powers defined above satisfy a depth 5 inequality (5).\nNow let I be the ideal in R associated with the two-dimensional representation,\nthe white dot labelled 2. Then d(J, I) is the depth of the matrix (1), so dI (S, R) = 1.\nIf I is the ideal of R associated with the first three white dots in the diagram above,\nthen J is the ideal in S associated to the first two black dots, and d(J, I) is the\nminimum depth of the (upper-left hand corner) matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 0\n\u2032\nM =\n0 1 1\n\nwhich has minimum depth 3. If I is the ideal associated to the three white dots labelled 3,2, and 3, we similarly compute dI (S, R) = 4. Finally, if I is ideal associated\nto the first four white dots in the diagram above, the dI (S, R) = 5.\nProposition 2.6. Suppose S \u2286 R is a subring pair of semisimple complex algebras\nand I \u2286 R is an ideal. Then dI (S, R) \u2264 d(S, R).\nProof. This follows from the observation above that dI (S, R) = d(J, I) where J \u2286 S\nand I \u2286 R are both subring pairs of semisimple algebras. But d(J, I) is the depth\nof a subgraph of the inclusion graph of S \u2286 R. By the description of depth of a\n\n\f8\n\nLARS KADISON\n\nbipartite graph as the minimum of the odd and even depths in terms of diameter\nof the row of black dots, it is clear that d(J, I) \u2264 d(S, R) .\n\u0003\n3. Even depth of QF extensions\nA proper ring extension is taken to be a monomorphism S \u0592\u2192 R; stretching\nthis terminology slightly, a ring homomorphism S \u2192 R is referred to as a ring\nextension, denoted by R | S. A ring extension R | S is a left QF extension if the induced module S R is finitely generated projective and the natural bimodules satisfy\nq\nR RS | R Hom (S R, S S)S for some positive integer q. A right QF extension is oppositely defined. A QF extension R | S is both a left and right QF extension and may\nbe characterized by both RS and S R being finite projective, and two h-equivalences\nh\nh\nof bimodules given by R RS \u223c R Hom (S R, S S)S and S RR \u223c S Hom (RS , SS )R\n[19, 20]. For example, a Frobenius extension S \u2192 R is a QF extension since it is\nleft and right finite projective and satisfies the stronger conditions that R is isomorphic to its right S-dual R\u2217 and its left S-dual \u2217 R as natural S-R-bimodules,\nrespectively R-S-bimodules.\n3.1. \u03b2-Frobenius extensions vs. QF extensions. In Hopf algebras and quantum algebras, examples of Frobenius extensions often occur with a twist foreseen\nby Nakayama and Tzuzuku, their so-called beta-Frobenius extension. Let \u03b2 be an\nautomorphism of the ring S and S \u2286 R a subring pair. We next denote the pullback module of a module S M along \u03b2 : S \u2192 S by \u03b2 M . A proper ring extension\nR | S is a \u03b2-Frobenius extension if RS is finite projective and there is a bimodule\nisomorphism S RR \u223c\n= \u03b2 Hom (RS , SS ). One shows that R | S is a Frobenius extension\nif and only if \u03b2 is an inner automorphism. A subring pair of Frobenius algebras\nS \u2286 R is \u03b2-Frobenius extension so long as RS is finite projective and the Nakayama\n\u22121\nautomorphism \u03b7R of R stabilizes S, in which case \u03b2 = \u03b7S \u25e6 \u03b7R\n[22]. For instance\na finite dimensional Hopf algebra R = H and S = K a Hopf subalgebra of H are\na pair of Frobenius algebras satisfying the conditions just given: the formula for \u03b2\nreduces to the following given in terms of the modular functions of H and K and\nthe antipode S [11, 7.8]:\nX\nmH (x(1) )mK (S(x(2) ))x(3)\n(7)\n\u03b2(x) =\n(x)\n\nWhen a \u03b2-Frobenius extension is a QF extension is addressed in the next proposition.\nProposition 3.1. A \u03b2-Frobenius extension R | S is a left QF extension if and only\nif there are ui , vi \u2208 R (i = 1, . . . , n) such that sui = ui \u03b2(s) and vi s = \u03b2(s)vi for all\ni, s \u2208 S, and\n(8)\n\n\u03b2 \u22121 (s) =\n\nn\nX\n\nui svi .\n\ni=1\n\nProof. Suppose R | S is \u03b2-Frobenius extension. Then the bimodule isomorphism\ngiven above applied to 1R has value E : R \u2192 S, a cyclic generator of \u03b2 Hom (RS , SS )R\nsatisfying E(s1 rs2 ) = \u03b2(s1 )E(r)s2 for all s1 , s2 \u2208 S, r \u2208 R. If x1 , . . . , xm \u2208 R and\n\u03c61 , . . .P\n, \u03c6m \u2208 Hom (RS , SS ) areP\nprojective bases of RS , and E(yj \u2212) = \u03c6j the equam\nm\ntions j=1 xj E(yj r) = r and j=1 \u03b2 \u22121 (E(rxj ))yj = r hold for all r \u2208 R. (Call\n\n\fIDEAL DEPTH OF QF EXTENSIONS\n\n9\n\n(E, xj , yj ) a \u03b2-Frobenius coordinate system of R | S. Note that also S R is finite\nprojective.)\nGiven the elements ui , vi \u2208 R satisfying the equations above, let Ei = E(ui \u2212)\nwhich defines n mappings in (the untwisted)PHom (S RS , S SS ). Also define n mapm\npings \u03c8i \u2208 Hom (R (\u2217 R)S , R RS ) by \u03c8i (g) = j=1 xj g(vi yj ) where it is not hard to\nP\nshow using the \u03b2-Frobenius coordinate equations that j xj \u2297S vi yj \u2208 (R \u2297S R)R\nPn\nfor each i (a Casimir element). It follows that i=1 \u03c8i (Ei ) = 1R and that R | \u2217 Rn\nas natural R-S-bimodules, whence R is a left QF extension of S.\nConversely, assume the left QF condition S R\u2217 R | Rn , equivalent to R RS | \u2217 Rn\nby applying the right S-dual functor and noting (\u2217 R)\u2217 \u223c\n= R as well \u2217 (R\u2217 ) \u223c\n= R.\nAlso assume the slightly rewritten \u03b2-Frobenius condition \u03b2 \u22121 RR \u223c\n= S (R\u2217 )R , which\nthen implies \u03b2 \u22121 RR | Rn . So there are n mappings\ngi \u2208 Hom (\u03b2 \u22121 RR , S RR ) and n\nP\nmappings fi \u2208 Hom (S RR , \u03b2 \u22121P\nRR ) such that ni=1 fi \u25e6 gi = idR . Equivalently, with\nui := f (1R ) and vi := g(1R ), ni=1 ui vi = 1R , and the equations in the proposition\nare satisfied.\n\u0003\nThe following corollary weakens one of the equivalent conditions in [7]. It implies that a finite dimensional Hopf algebra that is QF over a Hopf subalgebra is\nnecessarily Frobenius over it; nontrivial examples of QF extensions occur for weak\nHopf algebras over their separable base algebra [10].\nCorollary 3.2. Let H be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and K a Hopf subalgebra. In the notation of (7) the following are equivalent:\n(1) The automorphism, \u03b2 = idK .\n(2) The algebra extension H | K is a QF extension.\n(3) The modular functions mH (x) = mK (x) for all x \u2208 K.\nProof. (1 \u21d2 2) A Frobenius extension is aPQF extension. (2 \u21d2 3) Applying the\ncounit \u03b5 to (8), one obtains \u03b5\u25e6\u03b2 = \u03b5, since \u03b5( i ui vi ) = 1. Applied to (7) uniqueness\nof inverse in convolution algebra Hom (K, k) shows that mH = mK on K. (3 \u21d2 1)\nThis follows from (7).\n\u0003\nIt is well-known that for a Frobenius extension R | S, coinduction of a module MS\n(to the right R-module Hom (RS , MS )) is naturally isomorphic to induction of MS\n(to the right R-module M \u2297S R). Similarly, a QF extension has h-equivalent coinduction and induction functors, which is seen from the naturality of the mappings\nin the next proof.\nProposition 3.3. Suppose A MS is a bimodule and R | S is a QF extension. Then\nthere is an h-equivalence of bimodules,\n(9)\n\nAM\n\nh\n\n\u2297S RR \u223c\n\nA Hom (RS , MS )R .\n\nProof.

If R | S is QF extension, then R | S has left depth 2n if and only if\nR | S has right depth 2n.\nh\n\nProof. The left depth 2n condition on S \u2192 R recall is Cn+1 (R, S) \u223c Cn (R, S) as SR-bimodules. To this apply the additive functor Hom (\u2212R , RR ) (into the category\nof R-S-bimodules), noting that Hom (Cn (R, S)R , RR ) \u223c\n= Hom (Cn\u22121 (R, S)S , RS )\nvia f 7\u2192 f (\u2212 \u2297S * * * \u2212 \u2297S 1R ) for each integer n \u2265 1.

This is true as well if R is a commutative ring with S a subring,\nsince the ordinary tensor algebra on R \u2297S R may be extended to any number of\ntensor products.\nProposition 4.3. Let R | S be a ring extension. Suppose that there is a ring\nstructure on each Rn := Cn (R, S) for each n \u2265 0, a ring homomorphism Rn\u22121 \u2192\nRn for each n \u2265 1, and that the composite R \u2192 Rn induces the natural bimodule\ngiven by r * (r1 \u2297 * * * rn ) * r\u2032 = rr1 \u2297 r2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 rn r\u2032 . Then R | S has depth 2n + 1 if\nand only if Rn | S has depth 3.\nh\n\nProof. If R | S has depth 2n + 1, then Rn \u223c Rn+1 as S-bimodules. By induction\nh\n\u223c Rn \u2297S Rn . Then Rn | S\nof modules, also Rn \u223c R2n as S-bimodules. But R2n =\nhas depth three.\nh\nConversely, if Rn | S has depth 3, then R2n \u223c Rn as S-bimodules. But Rn+1 | R2n\nvia the split S-bimodule epi r1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 r2n 7\u2192 r1 * * * rn \u2297 rn+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 r2n . Then\n\u0003\nRn+1 | Rnq for some q \u2208 Z + . It follows that R | S has depth 2n + 1.\nWe may in turn embed a depth three extension into a ring extension having\ndepth two. The proof requires the QF condition. Retain the notation for the\nendomorphism ring introduced earlier in this section.\nTheorem 4.4. Suppose R | S is a QF extension. If R | S has depth 3, then E | S\nhas depth 2. Conversely, if E | S has depth 2, and RS is a generator, then R | S has\ndepth 3.\nh\n\nProof. Since R is a QF extension of S, we have E \u223c R \u2297S R as E-R-bimodules.\nh\nThen E \u2297S E \u223c R \u2297S R \u2297S R \u2297S R as E-S-bimodules. Given the depth 3 condition,\nh\nh\nR \u2297S R \u223c R as S-bimodules, it follows by two substitutions that E \u2297S E \u223c R \u2297S R\nh\nas E-S-bimodules. Consequently, E \u2297S E \u223c E as E-S-bimodules. Hence, E | S has\nright depth 2, and since it is a QF extension by the endomorphism ring theorem\nand transitivity, E | S also has left depth 2.\nConversely, we are given RS a progenerator, so that E and S are Morita equivalent rings, where S Hom (RS , SS )E and E RS are the context bimodules. If E | S has\nh\n\nh\n\ndepth two, then E \u2297S E \u223c E as E-S-bimodules. Then R \u2297S R \u2297S R \u2297S R \u223c R \u2297S R\nas E-S-bimodules. Since Hom (RS , SS ) \u2297E R \u223c\n= S as S-bimodules, a cancellah\n\ntion of the bimodules E RS follows, so R \u2297S R \u2297S R \u223c R as S-bimodules. Since\nR \u2297S R | R \u2297S R \u2297S R, it follows that R \u2297S R | Rq for some q \u2208 Z + . Then R | S has\ndepth 3.\n\u0003\n\n\fIDEAL DEPTH OF QF EXTENSIONS\n\n15\n\n5. Tower depth vs. depth of subrings\nIn this section we review tower depth from [15] and find a general case when it is\nthe same as subring depth defined in (4) and in [1]. We first require a generalization\nof left and right depth 2 to a tower of three rings. We say that a tower R | S | T where\nh\n\nR | S and S | T are ring extensions, has generalized right depth 2 if R \u2297S R \u223c R as\nnatural R-T -bimodules (where mappings T \u2192 S \u2192 R are composed to induce the\nmodule RT ). (Note that if T = S, this is the definition of the ring extension R | S\nhaving right depth 2. )\nThroughout the section below we suppose R | S a Frobenius extension and Ei \u0592\u2192\nEi+1 its tower above it, as defined in (14) and the ensuing discussion in Section 4.\nFollowing [15] (with a small change in vocabulary), we say that R | S has right tower\ndepth n \u2265 2 if the sub-tower of composite ring extensions S \u2192 En\u22123 \u0592\u2192 En\u22122 has\ngeneralized right depth 2; i.e., as natural En\u22122 -S-bimodules,\n(36)\n\nq\nEn\u22122 \u2297En\u22123 En\u22122 \u2295 \u2217 \u223c\n= En\u22122\n\nfor some positive integer q, since the reverse condition is always satisfied. Since\nE\u22121 = S and E0 = R, this recovers the right depth two condition on a subring S of\nR. To this definition we add that a Frobenius extension R | S has depth 1 if it is a\ncentrally projective ring extension; i.e., S RS | S q for some q \u2208 Z + . Left tower depth\nn is just defined using (36) but as natural S-En\u22122 -bimodules. By [15, Theorem 2.7]\nthe left and right tower depth n conditions are equivalent on Frobenius extensions.\nFrom the definition of tower depth and a comparison of (16) and (2.1) with\nI = R, the following lemma is obtained:\nLemma 5.1. Suppose S \u2286 R is a subring such that R is a Frobenius extension of\nS. If R | S has tower depth n, then S \u2286 R has depth 2n \u2212 2 for each n = 1, 2, . . ..\nq\nProof. From (36) we obtain Rn | Rn\u22121\nas R-S-bimodules; the rest of the proof is\nsorting out notation and indices.\n\u0003\n\nFrom [15, Lemma 8.3], it follows that if R | S has tower depth n, it has tower\ndepth n + 1. Define dF (R, S) to be the minimum tower depth if R | S has tower\ndepth n for some integer n, dF (R, S) = \u221e if the condition (36) is not satisfied for\nany n \u2265 2 nor is it depth 1. Notice that if S \u2286 R is a subring with R a Frobenius\nextension of S, then dF (R, S) = d(S, R) if one of d(S, R) \u2264 2 or dF (R, S) \u2264 2.\nThis is extended to dF (R, S) = d(S, R) if one of d(S, R), dF (R, S) \u2264 3 in the next\nlemma.\nNotice that tower depth n makes sense for a QF extension R | S: by elementary\nh\nconsiderations, it has right tower depth 3 if S \u2192 R \u0592\u2192 E satisfies E \u2297R E \u223c E as\nE-S-bimodules. It has been noted elsewhere that a QF extension has right tower\ndepth 3 if and only if it has left tower depth 3 by an argument essentially identical\nto that in [15, Th. 2.8] but replacing Frobenius isomorphisms with quasi-Frobenius\nh-equivalences.\nLemma 5.2. A QF extension R | S such that RS is a generator has tower depth 3\nif and only if S has depth 3 as a subring in R.\nProof. Since RS is a generator, R | S is a proper extension by a short argument.\nAssume S \u2286 R.\n\n\f16\n\nLARS KADISON\nh\n\n(\u21d2) By the QF property, E \u223c R \u2297S R as E-S-bimodules.

Since RS is a progenerator, we cancel bimodules E RS as in the\nh\nproof of Theorem 4.4 to obtain R \u2297S R \u223c R as S-bimodules. Hence S \u2286 R has\ndepth 3.\nh\nh\n(\u21d0) Given S RS \u223c S R \u2297S RS , by tensoring with E R \u2297S \u2212 we get R \u2297S R \u223c\nh\n\nR \u2297S R \u2297S R as E-S-bimodules. By the QF property, E \u2297R E \u223c E as E-S-bimodules\nfollows, whence R | S has tower depth 3.\n\u0003\nThe theorem below proves that subring depth and tower depth coincide on Frobenius generator extensions. At a certain point in the proof, we use the following\nfundamental fact about the tower Rn above a Frobenius extension R | S: since\nthe compositions of the Frobenius extensions remain Frobenius, the iterative constructions of E-multiplication on tensor-squares isomorphic to endomorphism rings\napplies, but gives isomorphic ring structures to those on the Rn . For example, the\ncomposite extension S \u2192 Rn is Frobenius with End (Rn )S \u223c\n= R2n ,\n= Rn \u2297S Rn \u223c\nisomorphic in its E \u25e6 E1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 En\u22121 -multiplication or its E-multiplication given in\n(17) [12].\nTheorem 5.3. Let S \u2286 R be a subring such that R is a Frobenius extension of S\nand RS is a generator. Then R | S has tower depth m for m = 1, 2, . . . if and only\nif the subring S \u2286 R has depth m. Consequently, dF (R, S) = d(S, R).\nProof. The cases m = 1, 2, 3 have been dealt with above. We divide the rest of the\nproof into odd m and even m. The proof for odd m = 2n + 1: (\u21d2) If R | S has\nq\nas R2n -S-bimodules. Continuing\ntower depth 2n + 1, then R2n \u2297R2n\u22121 R2n | R2n\nwith R2n \u223c\n= R2n\u22121 \u2297R2n\u22122 R2n\u22121 , iterating and performing standard cancellations,\nwe obtain\n(37)\n\nq\nR2n+1 | R2n\n\nas End (Rn )S -S-bimodules. But the module (Rn )S is a generator for all n by\nLemma 4.1, the endomorphism ring theorem for Frobenius generator extensions and\ntransitivity of generator property for modules (if MR and RS are generators, then\nrestricted module MS is clearly a generator). It follows that (Rn )S is a progenerator\nand cancellable as an End (Rn )S -S-bimodule (applying the Morita theorem as in\nthe proof of Theorem 4.4). Then S (Rn+1 )S | S (Rn )S after cancellation of Rn from\n(37), which is the depth 2n + 1 condition in (4).\n(\u21d0) Suppose Rn+1 \u2295 \u2217 \u223c\n= Rn as S-bimodules. Apply to this the additive functor\nRn \u2297S \u2212 from category of S-bimodules into the category of End (Rn )S -S-bimodules.\nWe obtain (37) which is equivalent to the tower depth 2n + 1 condition of R | S.\nThe proof in the even case, m = 2n does not need the generator condition (since\neven non-generator Frobenius extensions have endomorphism ring extensions that\nare generators):\n(\u21d2) Given the tower depth 2n condition R2n\u22121 \u2297R2n\u22122 R2n\u22121 \u223c\n= R2n is isoq\nmorphic as R2n\u22121 -S-bimodules to a direct summand in R2n\u22121\nfor some positive\ninteger q. Introduce a cancellable extra term in R2n \u223c\n= Rn \u2297R Rn+1 and in\nR2n\u22121 \u223c\n= End (Rn )R which is Morita equivalent\n= Rn \u2297R Rn . Now note that R2n\u22121 \u223c\nto R. After cancellation of the End (Rn )R -R-bimodule Rn , we obtain Rn+1 | Rn as\nR-S-bimodules as required by (4).\n\n\fIDEAL DEPTH OF QF EXTENSIONS\n\n17\n\n(\u21d0) Given R (Rn+1 )S | R (Rn )S , we apply End (Rn )R Rn \u2297R \u2212 obtaining R2n | R2n\u22121\nas R2n\u22121 -S-bimodules, which is equivalent to the tower depth 2n condition.\n\u0003\nA depth 2 extension R | S often has easier equivalent conditions, e.g., a normality\ncondition, to fulfill than the S-R-bimodule condition R \u2297S R | Rq [2]. Therefore the\nnext corollary (or one like it stated more generally for Frobenius extensions) is interesting in pursuing questions of whether a special type of ring extension has finite\ndepth (and placing finite depth ring extensions in the context of a Galois-normal\nextension). The corollary follows from [15, 8.6], Proposition 4.3 and Theorem 4.4.\nCorollary 5.4. Let K \u2286 H be a Hopf subalgebra pair of finite dimensional unimodular Hopf algebras. Then K has finite depth in H if and only if there is a tower\nalgebra Hm such that K \u2286 Hm has depth 2.\nIn practice, the depth is n or less if m \u2265 n \u2212 1 where Hm denotes H \u2297K * * * \u2297K H\n(m times H); cf. [6, Theorem 3.14]. In particular, when H = k[G] and K = k[J]\nare group algebras of a subgroup pair G \u2265 J, K \u2286 Hm has depth 2 for some\nm > 2[G : NG (J)] [1].\n5.1. Acknowledgements.
