These abundance results are\nconsidered in the discussion of the chemical inhomogeneity and nucleosynthetic\nhistory of M15.\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDetections of multiple main sequences and giant branches in globular clusters (GC;\ne.g. \u03c9Cen, NGC 2808, and NGC 1851; Bedin et al. 2004(9), Piotto et al. 2007(72), Han\net al. 2009(42)) have challenged the notion that these objects are uniformly mono-metallic\nstellar systems of unique age. In addition to the metallicity variations observed in certain\nclusters, the anomalous abundance behaviors of globulars include star-to-star scatter of light\nelement [el/Fe] ratios (for C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al) in both main sequence and giant\nstars (this is in contrast to the abundance trends of halo field stars; e.g. Carretta et al.\n2009a(18) and Gratton, Sneden, & Carretta 2004(36))1 . These departures in the relative\nabundances (found in stars of different evolutionary stages) imply that there are multiple\nstellar generations present within the globular cluster and that an initial generation may have\ncontributed to the intracluster medium. It is possible that three sources are responsible for\nthe aggregate chemical makeup of a globular cluster: a primordial source that generates the\ninitial composition of the protocluster cloud, a pollution source that deposits material into the\nICM from highly-evolved asymptotic branch stars, and a mixing source that is independent\nof the other two and the result of stellar evolution processes. Further discussion of these\nscenarios may be found in, e.g. Bekki et al. (2007)(10) and Carretta et al. (2009b)(15).\nOn the other hand in the vast majority of globular clusters, minimal scatter in the\nelement abundance ratios with Z>20 has been observed. The abundances for the neutron(n) capture elements europium and barium have been measured in several GC's, and only in\na few, exceptional cases have significantly large intracluster differences in these values been\nseen (e.g. M22; Marino et al. 2009(65)). The predominant mechanism of Eu manufacture is\nthe rapid n-capture process (r-process) whereas the primary nucleosynthetic channel for Ba is\nslow n-capture (s-process; additional information pertaining to these production mechanisms\nmay be found in e.g. Sneden, Cowan, & Gallino 2008(83)). Consequently, the abundance\nratio of [Eu/Ba] is used to demonstrate the relative prevalence of the r- or s-process in\n1\n\nWe adopt the standard spectroscopic notation (Helfer, Wallerstein, & Greenstein 1959(46)) that for\nelements A and B, [A/B] \u2261 log10 (NA /NB )? - log10 (NA /NB ) . We also employ the definition log \u000f(A) \u2261\nlog10 (NA /NH ) + 12.0.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nindividual stars. In globular clusters with a metallicity of [Fe/H]. \u22121, a general enhancement\nof [Eu/Ba] \u223c +0.4 to +0.6 dex is detected, which indicates that n-capture element production\nhas been dominated by the r-process (Gratton, Sneden, & Carretta 2004(36) and references\ntherein). This in turn is suggestive of explosive nucleosynthetic input from very massive\nstars.\nThe very metal-deficient globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078; [Fe/H]\u223c \u22122.3) has been\nsubject to several abundance investigations including the recent study by Carretta et al.\n(2009a(18)). They employed both medium-resolution and high-resolution spectra of over 80\nred giant stars to precisely determine the metallicity of this cluster: <[Fe/H]>= \u22122.314 \u00b1\n0.007. Additionally, they detected variations in the light element abundances (Na and O)\nfor stars along the entirety of the Red Giant Branch (RGB). Prior studies have also observed large scatter in the relative Ba and Eu (intracluster) abundances. With the spectra\nof 17 RGB stars, Sneden et al. (1997(86)) found a factor of three spread in both ratios:\n<[Ba/Fe]>= 0.07; \u03c3 = 0.18 and <[Eu/Fe]>= 0.49; \u03c3 = 0.20.2 They were able to exclude\nmeasurement error as the source for the scatter and determined that the variations were\ncorrelated: <[Eu/Ba]>= 0.41; \u03c3 = 0.11. In a follow-up study of 31 M15 giants by Sneden,\nPilachowski & Kraft (2000b(88)), the scatter in the relative Ba abundance was confirmed:\n<[Ba/Fe]>= 0.12; \u03c3 = 0.21 (limitations in the spectral coverage did not permit a corresponding analysis of Eu).\nThe majority of M15 high-resolution abundance analyses have employed yellow-red visible spectra to maximize signal-to-noise (stellar flux levels are relatively high for RGB targets\nin this region). In order to precisely derive the neutron capture abundance distribution in\nM15, Sneden et al. (2000a(85)) re-observed three tip giants in the blue visible wavelength\nregime (which contains numerous n-capture spectral transitions). The abundance determinations of 8 n-capture species (Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Dy) were performed and\nlarge star-to-star scatter in the all of the [El/Fe] ratios was measured. They also found that\nthe three stars exhibited a scaled solar system r-process abundance pattern. Additional\nverification of these abundance results was done by Otsuki et al. (2006(71)) in an analysis\nof six M15 RGB stars (the two studies had one star in common, K462). Consistent with\nSneden et al. (2000a(85)), they detected significant variation in the [Eu/Fe], [La/Fe] and\n[Ba/Fe] ratios. Furthermore, Otsuki et al. found that the ratios of [(Y,Zr)/Eu] show distinct anticorrelations with the Eu abundance. Finally employing an alternate stellar sample,\nPreston et al. (2006(73)) examined six red horizontal branch (RHB) stars of M15.3 For the\n2\n\nThe anomalously nitrogen-enriched star K969 is omitted; see Appendix A of Sneden et al. 1997(86)\n\n3\n\nThe papers from Sneden et al. (1997), Sneden, Pilachowski, & Kraft (2000b), Sneden et al. (2000a),\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nelements Sr, Y, Zr, Ba and Eu a large (star-to-star) spread in the abundances was measured.\nIn essence, all of these investigations have observed considerable chemical inhomogeneity in\nthe n-capture elements of the globular cluster M15.\nTwo issues are brought to light by the M15 abundance data: the timescale and efficiency\nof mixing in the protocluster environment; and, the nucleosynthetic mechanism(s) responsible for n-capture element manufacture. In this globular cluster, large abundance variations\nare seen in the two stellar evolutionary classes as well as in both the light and heavy neutron\ncapture species. There is a definitive enhancement of r-process elements found in some stars\nof M15 (e.g. K462), yet not exhibited in others (e.g. B584). Taking into consideration the\nentirety of the M15 n-capture results, these data hint at the existence of a nucleosynthetic\nmechanism different from the classical r- and s-processes. Evidence of such a scenario (with\nmultiple production pathways) may be also found in halo field stars of similar metallicity\nsuch as CS 22892-052 (Sneden et al. 2003(84)) and HD 122563 (Honda et al. 2006(47)),\nwhich have displayed similar abundance variations. Indeed, several models have advanced\nthe notion of more than one r-process formation scenario (e.g. Wasserburg & Qian 2000,\n2002(95; 74), Thielemann et al. 2001(90), and Kratz et al. 2007(55)).\nTo further understand the implications of the M15 results, the spectra from the three\nRGB stars of Sneden et al. (2000a)(85) and the six RHB stars of Preston et al. (2006)(73)\nare re-analyzed. A single consistent methodology for the analysis is employed and an expansive set of recently-determined oscillator strengths is utilized (e.g. Lawler et al. 2009(62),\nSneden et al. 2009(87), and references therein). As the pre- and post-He core flash giants\nare examined, the relative invariance of abundance distributions will be ascertained for r\u2212\nand s-process species. In consideration of the M15 investigations cited above, a few data\nanomalies have come to light. The two main issues to be resolved include: large discrepancies in the log \u000f(El) values between the studies of Sneden et al. (2000a)(85) and Otsuki et\nal. (2006)(71); and, the significant disparity in the derived metallicity for the M15 cluster\nbetween Preston et al. 2006 (<[Fe/H]>RHB = \u22122.63) and the canonically accepted value of\n<[Fe/H]>= \u22122.3 (e.g. Carretta et al. 2009a(18), Sneden et al. 2000a(85)). It is suggested\nthat these differences are mostly due to selection of atomic data, model atmosphere, and\ntreatment of scattering.\nand Preston et al. (2006) are from collaborators affiliated with institutions in both California and Texas.\nHereafter, these papers and other associated publications will be referred to as CTG.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL DATA\n\nFor the three RGB stars of the M15 cluster, the re-analysis of two sets of high resolution\nspectra was performed: the first from Sneden et al. (1997(86)) with approximate wavelength\ncoverage region of 5400\u00c5 . \u03bb . 6800\u00c5 and the second from Sneden et al. (2000a(85)) with a\nwavelength domain of 3600\u00c5 . \u03bb . 5200\u00c5. All spectral observations were acquired with the\nHigh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES; Vogt et al. 1994(94)) at the Keck I 10.0-m\ntelescope (with a spectral resolving power of R \u2261 \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb ' 45000). The signal-to-noise (S/N)\nrange of the data varied from 30 . S/N . 150 for the shorter wavelength spectra to 100\n. S/N . 150 for the longer wavelength spectra (the S/N value generally increased with\nwavelength). The three giants, K341, K462, and K5834 , were selected from the larger stellar\nsample of Sneden et al. (1997)(86) due to relative brightness, rough equivalence of model\natmospheric parameters, and extreme spread in associated Ba and Eu abundances.\nRe-examination of the high resolution spectra of six RHB stars from the study of Preston\net al. (2006)(73) was also done. The observations were taken at the Magellan Clay 6.5-m\ntelescope of the Las Campanas Observatory with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle\n(MIKE) spectrograph (Bernstein et al. 2003)(11). The data had a resolution of R' 40000\nand the S/N values ranged from S/N \u223c25 at 3600 \u00c5 to S/N \u223c120 at 7200 \u00c5 (note that\nalmost complete spectral coverage was obtained in the region 3600\u00c5 . \u03bb . 7200\u00c5). The six\nRHB targets were chosen from the photometric catalog of Buonanno et al. (1983)(13) and\naccordingly signified as B009, B028, B224, B262, B412 and B584. It should be pointed out\nthat these stars have significantly lower temperatures than other HB members (and thus,\nmatch up favorably with the RGB).\nFigure 1 features the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the M15 globular cluster\nwith a plot of the V versus (V \u2212 K) magnitudes. The V magnitudes for the RGB stars\nare taken from the prelimiary results of Cudworth (2011) and verified against the data\nfrom Cudworth (1976(25)). Alternatively, the RHB V magnitude values are obtained from\nBuonanno et al. (1983(13)). The K magnitudes for all M15 targets are taken from the Two\nMicron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006(81)). Cluster members with both B\nand V measurements from Buonanno et al. are displayed in the plot (denoted by the black\ndots) and the stars of the current study are indicated by large, red circles. Note that the\nidentifications of RGB and RHB members are based upon stellar atmospheric parameters as\nwell as the findings from Sneden et al. (1997(86)) and Preston et al. (2006(73); please consult\nthose references for additional details). Also in Figure 1, two isochrone determinations are\noverlayed upon the photometric data: Marigo et al. (2008(64); with the age parameter set to\n4\n\nThe Kustner (1921)(58) designations are employed throughout the text.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n12.5 Gyrs and a metallicity of [M/H]=-2.2; shown in green) and Dotter et al. (2008(27); with\nthe age parameter set to 12.5 Gyrs and a metallicity of [M/H]=-2.5; shown in blue). These\nare the best-fit isochrones to the general characteristics ascribed to M15 and no preference\nis given to either source.\nAdditional observational details of the aforementioned data samples may be found in\nthe original Sneden et al. (1997,2000a)(86; 85) and Preston et al. (2006)(73) publications.\nThese papers also contain descriptions of the data reduction procedures, in which standard\nIRAF5 tasks were used for extraction of multi-order wavelength-calibrated spectra from the\nraw data frames, and specialized software (SPECTRE; Fitzpatrick & Sneden 1987(30)) was\nemployed for continuum normalization and cosmic ray elimination.\nFigure 2 features a comparison of the spectra of all M15 targets. Displayed in this\nplot is a small wavelength interval 4121 \u2212 4133 \u00c5, which highlights the important n-capture\ntransitions La II at 4123.22 \u00c5 and Eu II at 4129.72 \u00c5. The spectra are arranged in decreasing\nTeff from the top to the bottom of the figure. As shown, the combined effects of Teff and\nlog g influence the apparent line strength, and accordingly, transitions which are saturated\nin the RGB spectra completely disappear in the warmer RHB spectra.\n\n3.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND MODEL DETERMINATION\n\nSeveral measures were implemented in order to improve and extend the efforts of Sneden\net al. (1997, 2000a)(86; 85) and Preston et al. (2006(73)). First, the modification of the line\nanalysis program MOOG was performed to accurately ascertain the relative contributions to\nthe continuum opacity (especially necessary for the bluer wavelength regions and the cool,\nmetal-poor RGB targets). Second, the employment of an alternative grid of models was done\nto obtain an internally consistent set of stellar atmospheric parameters for the total M15\nsample. Third, the utilization of the most up-to-date experimentally and semi-empiricallyderived transition probability data was done to determine the abundances from multiple\nspecies.\n\n3.1.\n\nAtomic Data\n\nSpecial effort was made to employ the most recent laboratory measurements of oscillator\nstrengths. When applicable, the inclusion of hyperfine and isotopic structure was done for the\n5\n\nIRAF is distributed by NOAO, which is operated by AURA, under cooperative agreement with the NSF.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nderivation of abundances. Tables 2 and 3 list the various literature sources for the transition\nprobability data. Some species deserve special comment. The Fe transition probability values\nare taken from the critical compilation of Fuhr & Wiese (2006(33); note for neutral Fe, the\nauthors heavily weigh the laboratory data from O'Brian et al. 1991(69)). No up-to-date\nlaboratory work has been done for Sr, and so, the adopted gf-values are from the semiempirical study by Brage et al. (1998(12); these values are in good agreement with those\nderived empirically by Gratton & Sneden 1994(37)). Similarly, the most recent laboratory\neffort for Y was by Hannaford et al. (1982(43)). Yet these transition probabilities appear to\nbe robust, yielding small line-to-line scatter.\nA particular emphasis of the current work is the n-capture element abundances, for\nwhich a wealth of new transition probability data have become recently available. Correspondingly, the extensive sets of rare earth gf -values from the Wisconsin Atomic Physics\nGroup were adopted (Sneden et al. 2009(87), Lawler et al. 2009(62), and references therein).\nThese data when applied to the solar spectrum yield photospheric abundances that are in\nexcellent agreement with meteoritic abundances. For neutron capture elements not studied by the Wisconsin group (which include Ba, Pr, Yb, Os, Ir, and Th), alternate literature\nreferences were employed (and these are accordingly given in the two aforementioned tables).\n\n3.2.\n\nConsideration of Isotropic, Coherent Scattering\n\nIn the original version of the line transfer code MOOG (Sneden 1973(82)), local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was assumed and hence, scattering was treated as pure absorption. Accordingly, the source function, S\u03bb , was set equal to the Planck function, B\u03bb (T ),\nwhich is an adequate assumption for metal-rich stars in all wavelength regions. However\nfor the extremely metal-deficient, cool M15 giants, the dominant source of opacity switches\nfrom H\u2212 BF to Rayleigh scattering in the blue visible and ultraviolet wavelength domain\n(\u03bb . 4500\u00c5). It was then necessary to modify the MOOG program as the LTE approximation was no longer sufficient (this has also been remarked upon by other abundance surveys,\ne.g. Johnson 2002(50) and Cayrel et al. 2004(20)).\nThe classical assumptions of one-dimensionality and plane-parallel geometry continue\nto be employed in the code. Now with the inclusion of isotropic, coherent scattering, the\nframework for solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) shifts from an initial value to\na boundary value problem. The source function then assumes the form6 of S = (1 \u2212 \u000f)J + \u000fB\n6\n\nTo re-state, the equation terms are defined as follows: S is the source function, \u000f is the thermal coupling\nparameter, J is the mean intensity, and B is the Planck function.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nand the description of line transfer becomes an integro-differential equation. The chosen\nmethodology for the solution of the RTE (and the determination of mean intensity) is the\napproach of short characteristics that incorporates aspects of an accelerated convergence\nscheme. In essence, the short characteristics technique employs a tensor product grid in\nwhich the interpolation of intensity values occurs at selected grid points. The prescription\ngenerally followed was that from Koesterke et al. (2002(52) and references therein). The\nAppendix provides more detail with regard to the MOOG program alterations.\nPrior to these modifications, for a low temperature and low metallicity star (e.g. a RGB\ntarget), the ultraviolet and blue visible spectral transitions reported aberrantly high abundances in comparison to those abundances found from redder lines. With the implementation\nof the revised code, better line-to-line agreement is found and accordingly, the majority of\nthe abundance trend with wavelength is eliminated for these types of stars. Note for the\nRHB targets, minimal changes are seen in abundances with the employment of the modified\nMOOG program (as the dominant source of opacity for these relatively warm stars is always\nH\u2212 BF over the spectral region of interest).\n\n3.3.\n\nAtmospheric Parameter Determination\n\nTo obtain preliminary estimates of Teff and log g for the M15 stars, photometric data\nfrom the aforementioned sources (Cudworth 2011; Buonanno et al. 1983(13); 2MASS) were\nemployed as well as those data from Yanny et al. 1994(40). To transform the color, the colorTeff relations of Alonso et al. (1999)(1) were used in conjunction with the distance modulus\n((m \u2212 M )0 = 15.25) and reddening (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10) determinations from Kraft & Ivans\n(2003(54)). Note that an additional intrinsic uncertainty of about 0.1 dex in log g remains\namong luminous RGB stars owing to stochastic mass loss of order 0.1 dex. Consequently,\ninitial masses of 0.8 M and 0.6M were assumed for RGB and RHB stars respectively. The\nphotometric V and (V-K) values as well as the photometrically- and spectroscopically-derived\nstellar atmospheric parameters are collected in Table 1.\nWith the use of the spectroscopic data analysis program SPECTRE (Fitzpatrick &\nSneden 1987(30)), the equivalents widths (EW) of transitions from the elements Ti I/II, Cr\nI/II, and Fe I/II were measured in the wavelength range 3800-6850 \u00c5. The preliminary Teff\nvalues were adjusted to achieve zero slope in plots of Fe abundance (log (\u000fF eI )) as a function\nof excitation potential (\u03c7) and wavelength (\u03bb). The initial values of log g were tuned to\nminimize the disagreement between the neutral and ionized species abundances of Ti, Cr,\nand Fe (particular attention was paid to the Fe data). Lastly, the microturbulent velocities\nvt were set as to reduce any dependence on abundance as a function of EW. Final values of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nTeff , log g, vt , and metallicity [Fe/H] are listed in Table 1, as well as those values previously\nderived by Sneden et al. (2000a(85)) for the RGB stars and Preston et al. (2006)(73) for the\nRHB stars.\n\n3.4.\n\nSelection of Model Type\n\nTo conduct a standard abundance analysis under the fundamental assumptions of onedimensionality and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), two grids of model atmospheres\nare generally employed: Kurucz-Castelli (Castelli & Kurucz 2003(19); Kurucz 2005(57)) and\nMARCS (Gustafsson et al. 2008(41)).7 The model selection criteria were as follows: the\nreconciliation of the metallicity discrepancy between the RGB and RHB stars of M15, the\nderivation of (spectroscopic-based) atmospheric parameters in reasonable agreement with\nthose found via photometry, and the attainment of ionization balance between the Fe I and\nFe II transitions. For the RHB targets, interpolated models from the Kurucz-Castelli and\nMARCS grids were comparable and yielded extremely similar abundance results. However,\nthere are a few notable differences between the two model types for the RGB stars with\nregard to the Pgas and Pelectron content pressures. Though beyond the scope of the current\neffort, it would be of considerable interest to examine in detail the exact departures between\nthe Kurucz-Castelli and MARCS grids. To best achieve the aforementioned goals for the\nM15 data set, MARCS models were accordingly chosen.\n\n3.5.\n\nPersistent Metallicity Disagreement between RGB and RHB stars\n\nFor the RHB stars, the presently-derived metallicties differ slightly from those of Preston\net al. (2006): <[FeI /H]> = -2.69 (a change of \u2206 = \u22120.03) and <[FeII /H]> = -2.64 (a change\nof \u2206 = \u22120.04). However for the RGB stars, the [Fe/H] results of the current study do vary\nsignificantly from those of Sneden et al. (2000): <[FeI /H]> = -2.56 (a downwards revision of\n\u2206 = \u22120.26) and <[FeII /H]> = -2.53 (a downwards revision of \u2206 = \u22120.28). The remaining\nmetallicity discrepancy between the RGB and RHB stars is as follows: \u2206(RGB \u2212 RHB)F eI\n= 0.13 and \u2206(RGB \u2212 RHB)F eII = 0.11. Even with the employment of MARCS models and\nthe incorporation of Rayleigh scattering (not done in previous efforts), the offset persists.\nRepeated exercises with variations in the Teff , log g, and vt values showed that this metallicity disagreement in all likelihood cannot be attributed to differences in these atmospheric\n7\n\nKurucz models are available through the website: http://kurucz.harvard.edu/ and MARCS models can\nbe downloaded via the website: http://marcs.astro.uu.se/\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nparameters. As a further check, the derivation of [FeI,II /H] values was performed with a\nlist of transitions satisfactorily measurable in both RGB and RHB spectra. No reduction in\nthe metallicty disagreement was seen as the offsets were found to be: \u2206(RGB \u2212 RHB)F eI\n= 0.11 (with 45 candidate FeI lines) and \u2206(RGB \u2212 RHB)F eII = 0.14 (with 3 candidate Fe\nIIII lines).\nThe data from the M15 RGB and RHB stars originate from different telescope/instrument\nset-ups. Additionally, somewhat different data reduction procedures were employed for the\ntwo samples. Possible contributors to the iron abundance offset could be the lack of consideration of spherical symmetry in the line transfer computations and the generation of\nsufficiently representative stellar atmospheric models for these highly evolved stars (which\nexist at the very tip of the giant branch and/or have undergone He-core flash). Indeed, it\nis difficult to posit a single, clear-cut explanation for the disparity in the RGB and RHB\n[Fe/H] values. In an analysis of the globular cluster M92, King et al. (1998(51)) derived an\naverage abundance ratio of <[Fe/H]>= -2.52 for six subgiant stars, a factor of two lower\nthan the <[Fe/H]> value measured in the red giant stars. Similarly, Korn et al. (2007)(53)\nsurveyed turn off (TO) and RGB stars of NGC 6397 and found a metallicity offset of about\n0.15 dex (with the TO stars reporting consistently lower values of [Fe/H]). They argued that\nthe TO stars were afflicted by gravitational settling and other mixing processes and as a\nresult, the Fe abundances of giant stars were likely to be nearer to the true value. While the\nTO stars do have Teff values close to that of the M15 RHB stars, they have surface gravities\nand lifetimes that are considerably larger. Accordingly, it is not clear if the offset in M15\nhas a physical explanation similar to that proposed in the case of NGC 6397.\n\n4.\n\nABUNDANCE RESULTS\n\nFor the extraction of abundances, the two filters of line strength and contaminant presence were used to assemble an effective line list. Abundance derivations for the majority\nof elements employed the technique of synthetic spectrum line profile fitting (accomplished\nwith the updated MOOG code as described in \u00a73.2). For a small group of elements (those\nwhose associated spectral features lack both hyperfine and isotopic structure), the simplified\napproach of EW measurement was used (completed with both the MOOG code and the\nSPECTRE program; Fitzpatrick & Sneden 1987(30)). Presented in Tables 2 and 3 are the\nlog \u000f abundance values for the individual transitions detected in the M15 RGB and RHB\nstars respectively. These tables also list the relevant line parameters as well as the associated\nliterature references for the gf -values employed.\nIn addition to the line-to-line scatter, errors in the abundance results may arise due\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nto uncertainties in the model atmospheric parameters. To quantify these errors in the M15\ndata set, a RGB target, K462, is first selected. If alterations of \u2206Tef f = \u00b1100 K are applied,\nthen the abundances of neutral species change by approximately \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.15 whereas\nthe abundances of singly-ionized species change by about \u2206[XII /H] ' \u00b10.04. Variations\nof \u2206log g = \u00b10.20 yield \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.04 in neutral species abundances and \u2206[XII /H]\n' \u00b10.05 in singly-ionized species abundances. Changes in the microturbulent velocity on\nthe order of \u2206vt = \u00b10.20 result in abundance variations of \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.08 and \u2206[XII /H]\n' \u00b10.04. The exact same procedure is then repeated for the RHB star, B009. Modifications\nof the temperature by \u2206Tef f = \u00b1100 K lead to abundance changes of \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.09 in\nneutral species and \u2206[XII /H] ' \u00b10.02 in singly-ionized species. Alterations of the surface\ngravity by \u2206log g = \u00b10.20 engender variations of \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.01 and \u2206[XII /H] ' \u00b10.07.\nFinally, variations of \u2206vt = \u00b10.20 produce abundance changes of \u2206[XI /H] ' \u00b10.08 and\n\u2206[XII /H] ' \u00b10.04.\nTo discuss the abundance results in the following subsections, the elements are divided\ninto four groupings: light (Z = 8; 11 \u2264 Z \u2264 21; Figure 3), iron-peak (22 \u2264 Z \u2264 28; Figure 4),\nlight/intermediate n-capture (29 \u2264 Z \u2264 59; Figure 5), and heavy/other (60 \u2264 Z \u2264 70;\nZ = 72, 76, 77, 90; Figure 6). The measurement of abundances was completed for a total\nof 40 species. Note that for the elements Sc, Ti, V, and Cr, abundance determinations\nwere possible for both the neutral and first-ionized species. In light of Saha-Boltzmannn\ncalculations for these elements, greater weight is given to the singly-ionized abundances (i.e.\nfor the stars of the M15 data set, only a small fraction of these elements predominantly\nreside in the neutral state).\nFigures 3, 4, 5, and 6 exhibit the abundance ratios for the M15 sample in the form\nof quartile box plots. These plots show the interquartile range, the median, and the minimum/maximum of the data. Outliers, points which have a value greater than 1.25 times the\nmedian, are also indicated. For all of the figures, RGB abundances are signified in red while\nRHB abundances are denoted in blue. Note that the plots depict the abundance results in\nthe [Elem/H] form in order to preclude erroneous comparisons of the RGB and RHB data,\nwhich would arise from the iron abundance offset between the two groups.\nTable 4 contains the <[Elem/Fe]> values for elements analyzed in the M15 sample along\nwith the line-to-line scatter (given in the form of standard deviations), and the number\nof lines employed. The subsequent discussion will generally refer to these table data and\nas is customary, present the relative element abundances with associated \u03c3 values. The\nreference solar photospheric abundances (without non-LTE correction) are largely taken from\nthe three-dimensional analyses of Asplund et al. (2005, 2009(5; 6)) and Grevesse et al.\n(2010(39)). However, the photospheric values for some of the n-capture elements are obtained\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nfrom other investigations (e.g. Lawler et al. 2009(62)). Table 5 lists all of the chosen\nlog \u000f numbers. Note that in the derivation of the relative element abundance ratios [X/Fe],\n<[FeI /H]> are employed for the neutral species transitions while <[FeII /H]> are used for the\nsingly-ionized lines. This is done in order to minimize ionization equilibrium uncertainties\nas described in detail by Kraft & Ivans (2003)(54).\n\n4.1.\n\nGeneral Abundance Trends\n\nWithin the RGB sample, the neutron capture element abundances of K462 are consistently the largest whereas those of K583 are the smallest. The two RHB stars, B009 and\nB262, exhibit abundance trends similar to those of the RGB objects. The expected anticorrelations in the proton capture elements (e.g. Na-O and Mg-Al) are seen. The greatest\nabundance variation with regard to the entire M15 data set is found for the neutron capture elements. Indeed, the star-to-star spread for the majority of n-capture abundances is\ndemonstrable for all M15 targets and is not likely due to internal errors.\nInspection of Table 4 data indicates that RHB stars generally have higher r-process\nelement abundances than RGB stars (on average \u2206[Elem/Fe]RHB\u2212RGB \u2248 0.3 dex). A sizeable portion of the discrepancy is attributable to the difference in the iron abundances as\n<[Fe/H]>RHB is approximately 0.12 dex lower than <[Fe/H]>RGB . The remaining offset is\nmost likely a consequence of the small number of targets coupled with a serious selection\neffect. The original sample of RHB stars from Preston et al. (2006(73)) was chosen as a\nrandom set of objects with colors and magnitudes representative of the red end of the HB.\nThese objects were selected without prior knowledge of the heavy element abundances. On\nthe other hand, the three RGB stars from Sneden et al. (2000a(85)) were particularly chosen\nas representing the highest and lowest abundances of the r-process as predetermined in the\n17 star sample of Sneden et al. (1997(86)).\n\n4.2.\n\nLight Element Abundances\n\nThe finalized set of light element abundances include: C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and ScI/II .\nIn general, an enhancement of these element abundances relative to solar is seen in the entire\nM15 data set.\nAn underabundance of carbon was found in one RHB and three RGB targets of M15\nbased on the measurement of CH spectral features. As the forbidden O I lines were detectable\nonly in RGB stars, the average abundance ratio for M15 is <[O/Fe]>RGB = +0.75. This\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nvalue is substantially larger than that found by Sneden et al. (1997)(86). A portion of the\ndiscrepancy is due to the approximate 0.15 dex difference in the <[FeI /H]> values between\nthe two investigations. The remainder of departure may be attributed to the adoption of\ndifferent solar photospheric oxygen values: the current study employs log \u000f(O) = 8.71 (Scott\net al. 2009(79)) while Sneden et al. uses log \u000f(O) = 8.93 (Anders & Grevesse 1989(2)).\nFor the determination of the sodium abundance, the current study relies solely upon the\nD1 resonance transitions. Table 4 lists the spuriously large spreads in the Na abundance for\nboth the RGB and RHB groups. The Na D1 lines are affected by the non-LTE phenomenon\nof resonance scattering (Asplund 2005b(4); Andrievsky et al. 2007(3)), which MOOG does\nnot take into account. Also, Sneden et al. (2000b(88)) made note of the relative strength\nand line profile distortions associated with these transitions and chose to discard the [Na/Fe]\nvalues for stars with Teff > 5000 K. Consequently, the sodium results from the current study\nare given little weight and are not plotted in Figure 3.\nAluminum is remarkable in its discordance: <[AlI /FeI ]>= 0.37 for one RHB and three\nRGB targets whereas <[AlI /FeI ]>= \u22120.43 for five RHB stars. Now, the relative aluminum\nabundances for the RHB stars match well with the values found by Preston et al. (2006(73)).\nSimilarly, the Al abundances from the current analysis agree favorably with the RGB data\nfrom Sneden et al. (1997(86)). Though relatively strong transitions are employed in the\nabundance derivation, the convergence upon two distinct [Al/Fe] values is nontrivial and\ncould merit further exploration.\nA decidedly consistent Ca abundance ratio is found for the RGB sample: < [CaI /F eI ] >RGB =\n0.29; and, also for the RHB sample: <[CaI /FeI ]>RHB = 0.53. After consideration of the iron\nabundance offset, the RHB stars still report slightly higher calcium abundances than the\nRGB stars. Overall, a distinct overabundance of Ca relative to solar is present in the M15\ncluster. Note that the ScI abundance determination was done for only one M15 star (and\ngives a rather aberrant result compared to the ScII abundance data from the other M15\ntargets).\n\n4.3.\n\nIron Peak Element Abundances\n\nThe list of finalized Fe-peak element abundances consists of TiI/II , VI/II , CrI/II , Mn, Co,\nand Ni. Due to RGB spectral crowding issues, derivations of [NiI /FeI ] ratios are performed\nonly for RHB stars.\nAchievement of ionization equilibrium did not occur for any of the perspective species:\nTiI/II , VI/II , or Cr I/II . In consideration of the entire M15 data set, the best agreement\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nbetween neutral and singly-ionized species arises for titanium, with all <[Ti/Fe]> ratios being\nsupersolar. The VII relative abundances compare well with one another for the RGB and\nRHB targets (comparison for VI is not possible as there are no RHB data for this species).\nBoth of the RGB and RHB <[CrI /FeI ]> ratios are underabundant with respect to solar and\nthe neutral chromium values match almost exactly with one another (after accounting for\nthe [Fe/H] offset). On the other hand, the worst agreement is found for CrI/II in RHB stars\nwith \u2206(II \u2212 I) = 0.47.\nSubsolar values with minimal scatter were found for the <[MnI /FeI ]> ratios in both the\nRGB and RHB stellar groups. However in comparison to RGB stars, manganese appears to\nbe substantially more deficient in RHB targets. The discrepancy may be attributed to both\nthe RGB/RHB iron abundance disparity as well as the employment of the MnI resonance\ntransition at 4034.5 \u00c5 for the RHB abundance determination. In particular, Sobeck et al.\n(2011(89)) have demonstrated that the manganese resonance triplet (4030.7, 4033.1, and\n4034.5 \u00c5) fails to be a reliable indicator of abundance. Consequently, the RHB abundance\nresults for MnI are given little weight and are not plotted in Figure 4.\n\n4.4.\n\nLight and Intermediate n-Capture Element Abundances\n\nFinalized abundances for the light and intermediate n-capture elements include Cu,\nZn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, and Pr. In general, the RGB element abundance ratios are\nslightly deficient with respect to the RHB values. Also, enhancement with respect to solar\nis consistently seen in all M15 targets for the elements Ce and Pr.\nAn extremely underabundant copper abundance relative to solar was found in the RGB\nstars: <[CuI /FeI ]>RGB = \u22120.91. A similar derivation could not take place in the RGB\ntargets as the CuI transitions were too weak. A large divergence between RGB and RHB\nstellar abundances exists for zinc. Detection of the Zn transitions was possible in only one\nRHB target, which could perhaps account for some of the discrepancy.\nFor the entire M15 data set, YII exhibits lower relative abundance ratios in juxtaposition\nto both SrII and ZrII . With regard to the three average elemental abundances (of Sr, Y, Zr),\nmoderate departures between the RGB and RHB groups are seen. Also, a large variation in\nthe <[SrII /FeII ]> ratio was found for the members of the RGB group.\nThough different sets of lines are employed, the RGB and RHB <[BaII /FeII ]> ratios\nare consistent with one another. A portion of the RHB abundance variation is due to the\nexclusive use of the resonance transitions in the determination (two lowest temperature\nRHB stars report quite high \u03c3 values; these strong lines could not be exploited in the RGB\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nanalysis). Notably for this element group, the greatest star-to-star abundance scatter was\nfound for lanthanum: \u2206RGB = 0.46 and \u2206RHB = 0.61 (excluding the one RHB outlier). The\nrelative cerium abundances also exhibit a wide spread in the RGB sample.\n\n4.5.\n\nHeavy n-Capture Element Abundances\n\nThe list of finalized <[El/Fe]> ratios for the heavy n-capture elements is as follows:\nNd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Hf, Os, Ir, Pb and Th. All of these element\nabundance ratios are enriched with regard to the solar values. As shown in Figure 6, a larger\nabundance spread is found for this group in comparison to the other element groups.\nNote that as Teff increases, the strength of the heavy element transitions rapidly decreases and as a consequence, the use of these lines for abundance determinations in the\nwarmest stars becomes unfeasible. It was possible to obtain robust abundances for Nd,\nSm, Tb, and Tm in a single RHB target. On the other hand, abundance extractions for\nthe species Os and Ir were done only in RHB stars (measurements of these element transitions were attainable as less spectral crowding occurs in these stars). Nonetheless, minimal\nline-to-line scatter is seen for the bulk of RGB and RHB n-capture abundances.\nA rigorous determination of the europium relative abundance was performed for all M15\nstars: <[EuII /FeII ]>RGB = 0.53 and <[EuII /FeII ]>RHB = 0.88. Despite the iron abundance\noffset, the largest departure between the two stellar groups is found for the element HoII .\nFurther, the greatest star-to-star scatter in the heavy n-capture elements is seen for the\n[YbII /FeII ] ratio: \u2206RGB = 0.55 and \u2206RHB = 0.58.\n\n4.6.\n\nComparison with Previous CTG efforts and Otsuki et al. (2006)\n\nThese new abundance results are now compared to those from the four prior CTG\npublications. For the majority of elements, the current data are in accord with the findings\nof Sneden et al. (1997, 2000a(86; 85)) and Preston et al. (2006(73)). In this effort, abundance\nderivations are performed for 13 new species: ScI , VII , CuI , PrII , TbII , HoII , ErII , TmII ,\nYbII , HfII , OsI , IrI , and PbII . For elements re-analyzed in the current study, the abundance\ndata have been improved with the use of higher quality atomic data, additional transitions,\nand a revised version of the MOOG program. A few large discrepancies in the [El/Fe] ratios\ndo occur between the current study and the previous M15 efforts. These departures can be\nattributed to the employment of different [Fe/H] and solar photospheric values as well as the\nupdated MOOG code. Accordingly, the results from the current analaysis supersede those\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nfrom the earlier CTG papers.\nAs in Sneden et al. 1997(86), the abundance behavior of the proton capture elements\nappears to be decoupled from that of the neutron capture elements. Notably for M15,\nsignificant spread in the abundances was confirmed for both Ba and Eu. The scatter of\n\u2206log\u000f(Ba) = 0.48 and \u2206log\u000f(Eu) = 0.90 from the current effort is in line with that of\n\u2206log\u000f(Ba) = 0.60 and \u2206log\u000f(Eu) = 0.73 from Sneden et al. (1997)(86).\nComparison of the findings from the current study to those from Otsuki et al. (2006)(71)\nhas also been done and will be limited to the only star that the two investigations have\nin common, K462. Due to differences in the <[Fe/H]> values, the log (\u000f) data of the\ntwo analyses are compared. The model atmospheric parameters for K462 differ somewhat\nbetween the current effort (Teff /log g/vt = 4400/0.30/2.00) and Otsuki et al. (Teff /log g/vt\n= 4225/0.50/2.25). However, the agreement in the abundances for the elements Y, Zr,\nBa, La and Eu is rather good between the two studies, with the exact differences ranging:\n0.01 \u2264| \u2206(Otsuki\u2212Current) |\u2264 0.16. The largest disparity occurs for Sr, with both analyses\nemploying the resonance transitions. As mentioned previously, these lines are not the most\nrigorous probes of abundance.\n\n4.7.\n\nGeneral Relationship of Ba, La, and Eu Abundances\n\nSneden et al. (1997)(86) claimed to have found a binary distribution in a plot of [Ba/Fe]\nversus [Eu/Fe], with 8 stars exhibiting relative Ba and Eu abundances approximately 0.35\ndex smaller than the remainder of the M15 data set. To re-examine their assertion, Figure 7\nis generated, which plots [(Ba, La)/H] as a function of [Eu/H] for the entire data sample\nof the current study. It also displays the re-derived/re-scaled Ba, La, and Eu abundances\nfor all of the giants from the Sneden et al. (1997)(86) publication. No decisive offset is\nevident in either panel of Figure 7. For completeness, the equivalent width data from Otsuki\net al. (2006)(71) were also re-analyzed and the abundances were re-determined. Again, no\nbifurcation was detected in the Ba and Eu data.8\n8\n\nTo avoid duplication, the stars from Ostuki et al. are not plotted as they are a subset of the original\nsample from the Sneden et al. (1997(86)) study.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n5.\n\nDATA INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS\n\nA significant amount of r-process enrichment has occurred in the M15 globular cluster.\nFigure 8 plots the average log \u000f values of the n-capture elements (with 39 \u2264 Z \u2264 70) for three\nRGB stars (K341, K462, K583; signified by red symbols) and three RHB stars (B009, B224,\nB262; denoted by blue symbols).9 The solid black line in this figure indicates the scaled,\nsolar r-process prediction as computed by Sneden, Cowan, & Gallino (2008)(83). All of the\nelement abundances are normalized to the individual stellar log (\u000fEu ) values (Eu is assumed\nto be an indicator of r-process contribution). For the n-capture elements with Z = 64 \u2212 72,\nthe RGB stellar abundance values strongly correlate with the solar r-process distribution.\nSimilarly for the RHB stars, these abundances match well to the solar r-process pattern for\nmost of the elements in the Z = 64 \u2212 72 range.\nFigure 8 also displays the scaled, solar s-process abundance distribution (green, dotted\nline). The s-process predictions are also taken from Sneden, Cowan, & Gallino and the\nvalues are normalized to the solar log (\u000fBa ) (Ba is considered to be an indicator of s-process\ncontribution). As shown for the Z = 64 \u2212 72 elements, there is virtually no agreement\nbetween the solar s-process pattern and either the RGB or the RHB stellar abundances. The\ns-process predictions compare well to the RGB abundances for only two elements: Ce and\nLa. Thus, it follows that the nucleosynthesis of the heavy neutron capture elements in M15\nwas dominated by the r-process. In addition, the abundance pattern for the light n-capture\nelements (Sr, Y, Zr) does not adhere to either a solar r-process or s-process distribution.\n\n5.1.\n\nEvidence for Additional Nucleosynthetic Mechanisms Beyond the\nClassical r- and s-process\n\nTo further examine the anomalous light n-capture abundances in the M15 cluster, Figures 9 and 10 are generated. For the stars of current effort and those from Otsuki et al.\n(2006)(71), these two plots display the abundances of the n-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr and\nLa) as a function of the [Ba/H] and [Eu/H] ratios, respectively. Moreover, the abundance\nresults from five select field stars which represent extremes in r-process or s-process enhancement are plotted (CS 22892-052 [Sneden et al. 2003, 2009(84; 87)]; CS 22964-161 [Thompson\net al. 2008](91); HD 115444 [Westin et al. 2000(97), Sneden et al. 2009(87)]; HD 122563\n[Cowan et al. 2005(23), Lai et al. 2007(60)]; HD 221170 [Ivans et al. 2006(49), Sneden et\n9\n\nB028, B412, and B584 are not included in the figure as these stars lack abundances for most of the\nelements in the specified Z range.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nal. 2009(87)]).\nIn Figure 9, an anti-correlative trend is seen for Sr, Y and Zr with Ba while no explicit\ncorrelative behavior is apparent for La. The correlation coefficient, r, is indicated in each\npanel. Likewise, La and Eu appear un-correlated in Figure 10. The [(Sr, Y, Zr)/Eu] ratios\nall exhibit anti-correlation with [Eu/H] in this figure. As shown, the elements Sr, Y, and Zr\nclearly demonstrate an anti-correlative relationship with both the markers of the s-process\n(Ba) and the r-process (Eu).\nFigures 9 and 10 collectively imply that the production of the light neutron capture\nelements most likely did not transpire via the classical forms of the s-process or the r-process.\nThis finding is not novel. The abundance survey of halo field stars by Travaglio et al.\n(2004)(92) previously established the decoupled behavior of the light n-capture species to\nboth Ba and Eu. Further, they postulated that an additional nucleosynthetic process was\nnecessary for the production of these elements (Sr, Y , Zr) in metal-deficient regimes (coined\nthe Lighter Element Primary Process; LEPP).\nThe overabundances of Sr and Zr (see Figure 8) could have been the result of a small\ns-process contribution to the M15 proto-cluster environment. To investigate this possibility,\nan abundance determination is performed for Pb, a definitive main s-process product. The\nupper panel of Figure 11 illustrates the synthetic spectrum fits to the neutral Pb transition\nat a wavelength of 4057.8 \u00c5 in the M15 giant, K462. An upper limit of log \u000f(P b) . -0.35\ncan only be established for this star. For the remaining two RGB targets, upper limits were\nalso determined and accordingly for all three, the average values of log \u000f(P b) . -0.4 and\n<[Pb/Eu]> . -0.15 were found.\nThe lower panel of Figure 11 plots [Pb/Eu] as a function of [Eu/Fe] for the three M15\nRGB stars and the five, previously-employed halo field stars. In a recent paper, Roederer\net al. (2010(77)) suggest that detections of Pb and enhanced [Pb/Eu] ratios should be strong\nindicators of main s-process nucleosynthesis. In turn, they contend that non-detections of\nPb and depleted [Pb/Eu] ratios should signify the absence of nucleosynthetic input from\nthe main component of the s-process (see their paper for further discussion). With the\nabundances of 161 low-metallicity stars ([Fe/H] < -1), Roederer et al. empirically determined\na threshold value of [Pb/Eu] = +0.3 for minimum AGB contribution. As shown in the figure,\nthe M15 giants lie below this threshold and accordingly, are likely devoid of main s-process\ninput. Thus in the case of the M15 globular cluster, the light neutron capture elements\npresumably originated from an alternate nucleosynthetic process (e.g. \u03bd \u2212 p process, Frohlich\net al. 2006(32); high entropy winds, Farouqi et al. 2009(29)).\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nM15 Abundances in Relation to the Halo Field\n\nThe upper panel of Figure 12 displays the evolution of the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio\nwith [Fe/H] for all M15 targets as well as for a sample of hundreds of field stars. For this\nfigure, halo and disk star data have been taken from these surveys: Fulbright (2000)(34),\nReddy et al. (2003)(76), Cayrel et al. (2004)(20), Cohen et al. (2004)(22), Simmerer et\nal. (2004)(80), Barklem et al. (2005)(8), Reddy, Lambert & Allende Prieto (2006)(75),\nFran\u00e7ois et al. (2007)(31), and Lai et al. (2008)(59). As shown, the scatter in the [Mg/Fe]\nabundance ratio is fairly small: \u2206([Mg/Fe])M AX \u2248 0.6 dex for all stars under conisderation\nand \u2206([Mg/Fe])M AX \u2248 0.1 dex for the M15 data set. In the metallicity regime below\n[Fe/H] . -1.1, the roughly consistent trend of [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio is due in part to\nthe production history for these elements: magnesium originates from hydrostatic burning\nin massive stars while iron is manufactured by massive star, core-collapse SNe. If the short\nevolutionary lifetimes of these massive stars are taken into context with the abundance\ndata, it would seem to indicate that the core-collapse SNe are rather ubiquitous events in\nthe Galactic halo. Accordingly, the products that result from both stellar and explosive\nnucleosynthesis of massive stars should be well-mixed in the interstellar and intercluster\nmedium. The apparent downward trend in the [Mg/Fe] ratio, in the metallicity region with\n[Fe/H]& -1.1, is due to nucleosynthetic input from Type Ia SNe, which produce much more\niron in comparison to Type II events.\nIn a similar vein, the lower panel of Figure 12 plots [Eu/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]\nand demonstrates that as the metallicity decreases, the spread in the [Eu/Fe] abundance\nratio increases enormously10 . By contrast, the scatter in the M15 [Eu/Fe] ratios is large and\ncomparable to the spread of the halo field at that metallicity. Specifically in the metallicity\ninterval -2.7 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 -2.2, the scatter in the [Eu/Fe] ratio is found to be \u03c3 = \u00b10.27\nfor the nine stars of the M15 sample and similarly for the 23 halo giants, the associated\nscatter is \u03c3 = \u00b10.33. This variation in the relative europium abundance ratio (as first\ndetected by Gilroy et al. 1988(35) and later confirmed by others, e.g. Burris et al. 2000(14),\nBarklem et al. (2005)(8)) indicates an inhomogeneous production history for Eu and other\ncorresponding r-process elements. These elements likely originate from lower mass SNe and\ntheir production is not correlated with that of the alpha elements (Cowan & Thielemann\n2004(24)). Furthermore, it seems that nucleosynthetic events which generated the r-process\nelements were rare occurrences in the early Galaxy. As a consequence, these elements were\nnot well-mixed in the interstellar and intercluster medium (Sneden et al. 2009(87)). Note\n10\n\nThough the data sample of Figure 12 is compilation of several sources, the scatter in the [Mg/Fe] and\n[Eu/Fe] ratios duplicates that found by such large scale surveys as, e.g. Barklem et al. (2005)\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nthat r-process enhancement seems to be a common feature of all globular clusters (e.g.\nGratton, Sneden, & Carretta 2004(36)). On the other hand, the scatter in select r-process\nelement abundances, as found in M15, is not.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA novel effort was undertaken to perform a homogenous abundance determination in\nboth the RGB and RHB members of the M15 globular cluster. The current investigation\nemployed improved atomic data, stellar model atmospheres, and radiative transfer code. A\nresolute offset in the iron abundance between the RGB and RHB stars on the order of 0.1\ndex was measured. Notwithstanding, the major findings of the analysis for both the RGB\nand RHB stellar groups include: a definitive r-process enhancement; a significant spread in\nthe abundances of the neutron capture species (which appears to be astrophysical in nature);\nand, an anti-correlation of light n-capture element abundance behavior with both barium\n([Ba/H]) and europium ([Eu/H]). Accordingly, the last set of findings may offer proof of\nthe operation of a LEPP-type mechanism within M15. To determine if these abundance\nbehaviors are generally indicative of very metal-poor globular clusters, a comprehensive\nexamination of the chemical composition of the analogous M92 cluster should be undertaken\n([Fe/H] \u223c -2.3, Harris et al. 1996(44); the literature contains relatively little information\nwith regard to the n-capture abundances for this cluster).\nTo date, the presence of multiple stellar generations within the globular cluster M15 has\nnot been irrefutably established. In a series of papers, Carretta et al. (2009a, 2009c, 2010(18;\n16; 17)) offered compelling proof in the detection of light element anti-correlative behavior\n(Na-O) in numerous members of the M15 RGB. Lardo et al. (2011(61)) did find a statistically\nsignificant spread in the SDSS photometric color index of u \u2212 g, but yet they were not able\nto demonstrate a clear and unambiguous correlation of (u \u2212 g) with the Na abundances in\nthe RGB of the M15 cluster (which would have provided further evidence). To wit, recent\ninvestigations of M15 have revealed several atypical features including: probable detection\nof an intermediate mass black hole (van der Marel et al. 2002(93); though the result is under\nsome dispute); observation of an intracluster medium (Evans et al. 2003(28)); detection of\nmass loss (Meszaros et al. 2008, 2009(67; 66)); identification of extreme horizontal branch\nand blue hook stars (Haurberg et al. 2010(45)); and, observation of an extended tidal tail\n(Chun et al. 2010(21)). It would be worthwhile to examine these peculiar aspects of the\nglobular cluster in relation to the abundance results of M15. Further scrutiny is warranted in\norder to understand the star formation history and mixing timescale of the M15 protocluster\nenvironment.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nWe are deeply indebted to L. Koesterke for his extensive advice with regard to the modification of the MOOG code. We are grateful to the referee for several valuable suggestions.\nWe also thank I. Roederer for helpful comments pertaining to drafts of the manuscript.\nThe current effort has made use of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), the NIST\nAtomic Spectra Database (ASD), and the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD). Funding\nfor this research has been generously provided by the National Science Foundation (grants\nAST 07-07447 to J.C. and AST 09-08978 to C.S.).\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nA.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe essential approach to the solution of radiative transfer in the MOOG program\nhas been altered with the employment of short characteristics and the application of an\naccelerated lambda iteration (ALI) scheme. Original development of the short characteristics (SC) methodology in the context of radiative transfer was done by Mihalas, Auer, &\nMihalas (1978(68)). Improvement of the SC approach in the explicit specification of the\nsource function (at all grid points) was made by Olson & Kunasz (1987)(70) and Kunasz &\nAuer (1988(56)). As a supplemental reference, the current version of MOOG draws upon\nthe concise treatment of Auer & Paletou (1994(7)). The implementation of the ALI technique within the framework of radiative transfer and stellar atmospheres was first done by\nWerner (1986(96)) and subsequently refined by both e.g., Rybicki & Hummer (1991(78))\nand Hubeny (1992(48)). The main SC and ALI prescription followed by the MOOG code\nis that from Koesterke et al. (2002(52) and references therein). Since the text below is a\ngeneral description and pertains to the specific coding in MOOG, the reader should consult\nthe aforementioned references as they contain significantly more information.\nThe primary modification to MOOG is the creation and incorporation of four new\nsubroutines. The names and purposes of the new subroutines are as follows: AngWeight.f,\nwhich determines the Gaussian weights and integration points; Sourcefunc_scat_cont.f,\nwhich incorporates both a scattering and an absorption component to compute the source\nfunction and resultant flux for the continuum; Sourcefunc_scat_line.f, which incorporates\nboth a scattering and an absorption component to compute the source function and resultant\nflux for the line; and, Cdcalc_JS.f, which calculates the final line depth via the emergent\ncontinuum and line fluxes. To accommodate these additions, several key subroutines were\nalso revised. Further details and the publicly-available MOOG code may be found at the\nwebsite: http://verdi.as.utexas.edu/moog.html. Note that MOOG still retains the\ncapacity to operate in pure absorption mode with the source function set simply to S = \u000fB.\n\nB.\n\nContributions to the Continuous Opacity\n\nTo remind the reader, in the visible spectral range, the two principal sources of opacity\nin stellar atmospheres are the bound-free absorption from the negative hydrogen ion (H\u2212 )\nand Rayleigh scattering from neutral atomic hydrogen. The standard expression (e.g. Gray\n1976(38)) for the H\u2212 BF absorption coefficient is\n\u03ba ' 4.1458 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u03b1BF Pe \u03985/2 100.754\u0398\n\n(B1)\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nwhere \u03b1BF is the bound-free atomic absorption coefficient (which has frequency dependence),\nPe is the electron pressure, and \u0398 = 5040/T (note that Eq. B1 is per neutral hydrogen atom).\nWith regard to Rayleigh scattering, the scattering cross-section of radiation with angular\nfrequency \u03c9 incident upon a neutral H atom is given by the Kramers-Heisenberg formula in\nterms of atomic units as\n\u03c3(\u03c9)\n=\n\u03c3T\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c91\n\n\u00134\n\n\u0012\nA0 + A2\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c91\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\n+ A4\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c91\n\n2\n\n\u00134\n+ ***\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thompson scattering cross-section and \u03c91 is the angular frequency corresponding to the Lyman limit. Numerical calculations of the Ai coefficients and the generation\nof an exact expression for Eq. B2 have been done by Dalgarno & Williams (1962(26)) and\nmore recently by Lee & Kim (2004(63)).\nThe H\u2212 BF and Rayleigh scattering opacity contributions depend on temperature and\nmetallicity (and to some extent, on the surface gravity). Rayleigh scattering also has a \u03bb\u22124\ndependence, and as a consequence, it greatly influences blue wavelength transitions. For the\nmajority of stars (such as dwarfs and sub-giants), H\u2212 BF is the dominant opacity source in the\nvisible spectral regime. However for low temperature, low metallicity giants, the Rayleigh\nscattering contribution becomes comparable to and even exceeds that from H\u2212 BF in the\nultraviolet and blue visible wavelength regions. Therefore, to accurately determine the line\nintensity with the correct amount of flux and opacity contribution for all stellar types and\nover a wide spectral range, isotropic, coherent scattering must be considered.\n\nC.\n\nForm of the Radiative Transfer Equation and Implementation of the ALI\nScheme\n\nThe source function is then written as: S = (1 \u2212 \u000f)J + \u000fB (where \u000f is the thermal\ncoupling parameter, J is the mean intensity, and B is the Planck function). To commence\nwith the formal solution of the radiation transfer equation, a fundamental assumption is\nmade in that the source function is specified completely in terms of optical depth. After\nsome mathematical manipulation, the radiative transfer equation becomes\n\u03bc2\n\nd2 j\n=J \u2212S\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the directional cosine and \u03c4 is the optical depth. Eq. C1 is an integro-differential\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nequation (and subject to boundary conditions). To obtain the numerical solution of Eq. C1,\na discretization in angle and optical depth is necessary. As a consequence, the solution is\nsimplified and a Gaussian quadrature summation is done instead of an integration. Though\nit is eventually possible to evaluate Eq. C1 in a single step, the use of an iterative method\nto arrive at a solution is preferred as it is computationally faster than a straightforward\napproach. For the MOOG program, the ALI technique is employed with the application of a\nfull acceleration. In the context of ALI scheme, the transfer equation takes the form of J =\n\u039b[S], where \u039b represents the matrix operator. Through the concept of preconditioning, ALI\nallows for the efficient, iterative solution of a (potentially) large system of linear equations.\nThe main steps of the iterative cycle are the evaluation of J = \u039b[S], the computation of the\n\u2206S quantity, and the corresponding adjustment to the source function.\n\nD.\n\nShort Characteristic Solution of Line Transfer\n\nFrom a general viewpoint, radiative transfer can be thought of as the propagation of\nphotons along a ray on a two-dimensional grid. Note that the number of rays corresponds to\nthe number of quadrature angles. Determination of radiation along a ray is done periodically\nat ray segments, or short characteristics. Essentially, SC start at a grid point and proceed\nalong the ray until a cell boundary is met. At these cell boundaries, the intensity, opacity,\nand source function values are established. Then with the knowledge of the cell boundary\nintensities, the intensity at other non-grid points can be calculated.\nSpecifically with regard to MOOG, the intensity determination is a function of depths\n(i) and angles (j). It is performed for both an inward (i\u22121) and an outward (i+1) direction.\nAlong the characteristic, the opacity quantity is assumed to be a linear function. In effect,\nthe intensity for the ray can be expressed as\n\u2212\u2206\u03c4 (i)\n\nI = Ie\n\nZ\n+\n\nS(\u03c4 )e\u2212\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n(D1)\n\nThe optical depth step \u2206\u03c4 can be thought of as the path integral of the opacity\nalong the characteristic (the entire, involved definition of the \u2206\u03c4 quantity is found in the\nSourcefunc_scat_* subroutines). Now, the evaluation of Eq. D1 requires the interpolation\nof the source function. A linear interpolation is sufficient to satisfy the various boundary\nconditions. Interpolation over [S(i), S(i \u2213 1)] then entails\nZ\n\nS(\u03c4 )e\u2212\u03c4 d\u03c4 = S(i)w1 (i) + S(i \u2213 1)w2 (i)\n\n(D2)\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nThe weights are given by the relations\n\nw0 (i) = (e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 (i) \u2212 1)/\u2206\u03c4 (i)\n\n(D3)\n\nw1 (i) = 1 + w0 (i)\n\n(D4)\n\nw2 (i) = \u2212e\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c4 (i)\n\n\u2212 w0 (i)\n\n(D5)\n\nThese weights are found by recursion. The use of linear interpolation does not generate\nsignificant error (as normally would occur) due to the optically-thin nature of the boundary\nlayer. The expression for the mean intensity, J, subsequently becomes\nJ(i) = J(i) + 0.5wGau (j)I\n\n(D6)\n\nwhere the wGau are the Gaussian quadrature weights (these are distinct from the weights of\nEq. D2). The summation over all depth points and angles(/rays) is necessarily performed.\nThe SC formal solution of the transfer equation then proceeds in an iterative manner.\nOngoing and future improvements to the MOOG code include: the incorporation of\nthe Lee & Kim (2004(63)) formulation for Rayleigh scattering (for atomic hydrogen), the\nemployment of a further discretization with regard to frequency, and the implementation of\nspherically-symmetric geometry in the solution of radiative transfer.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nA.

ApJ, 530:783\u2013799, February 2000.\n\nThis preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros v5.2.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- A color-magnitude diagram for the globular cluster M15. For cluster members\n(indicated by small black dots), V magnitudes are taken Buonanno et al. (1983) while the\nK magnitudes are obtained from the 2MASS database (Skrutskie et al. 2006). Note that\nstars with both B and V magnitudes from Buonanno et al. are shown in the plot. The\nprogram stars are signified by large, red circles. Also displayed are the isochrone data from\nboth Marigo et al. (2008; labeled PM2008; shown in green) and Dotter et al. (2008; labeled\nAD2008; shown in blue).\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- A small wavelength region shown for all program stars. For the purposes of display,\nthe relative fluxes of target stars (other than K341) have been shifted by additive constants.\nVertical dotted lines denote the spectral features of La II at a wavelength of 4123.22 \u00c5 and\nof Eu II at 4129.72 \u00c5. Note that these transitions appear to be more pronounced in the\nspectra of the lower temperature RGB targets.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Binned abundances for the elements with Z = 6, 8, 12 \u2212 14, 20 \u2212 21 displayed\nas quartile boxplots. For each species, the boxplot shows the median, the upper and lower\nquartiles, and the extremes for both the RGB (denoted in red) and RHB (signified in blue)\nsamples. Outliers, data points with values greater than 1.25 times the median, are indicated\nby star symbols. Note that there are no RHB points for C I and O I. Note that a depletion\nin the relative carbon abundance with respect to solar is found.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Binned abundances for the elements with 22 \u2264 Z \u2264 27 displayed as quartile\nboxplots. For each species, the boxplot shows the median, the upper and lower quartiles,\nand the extremes for both the RGB (denoted in red) and RHB (signified in blue) samples.\nNote that no RHB data exist for V I. Also, the Mn I results have been set aside for the RHB\nstars (consult the text for further information). The most consistent agreement between\nneutral and first-ionized species is found for Ti in all M15 stars.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Binned abundances for the elements with Z = 29, 30, 38 \u2212 40, 56 \u2212 59 displayed\nas quartile boxplots. For each species, the boxplot shows the median, the upper and lower\nquartiles, and the extremes for both the RGB (denoted in red) and RHB (signified in blue)\nsamples. Outliers, data points with values greater than 1.25 times the median, are indicated\nby star symbols. Note that there are no RHB data points for Cu I and also, only one RHB\nabundance value for Zn I.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Binned abundances for the elements with 60 \u2264 Z \u2264 70 displayed as quartile\nboxplots. For each species, the boxplot shows the median, the upper and lower quartiles,\nand the extremes for both the RGB (denoted in red) and RHB (signified in blue) samples.\nOutliers, data points with values greater than 1.25 times the median, are indicated by star\nsymbols. Note that only one RHB abundance value was found for the elements Nd II, Sm\nII, and Tm II. In the case of Tb II, no RHB measurements were possible.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Plots of [(Ba, La)/H] as a function of [Eu/H] for the M15 stars of the current\nstudy as well as those from the original Sneden et al. (1997) paper. Also shown are the\nassociated error bars for the abundances (these are the standard deviation values given in\nTable 4). Note that the Eu and La abundance determinations for the 1997 stellar sample\nare based upon one transition only (and consequently, no error bars are plotted). Contrary\nto Sneden et al., no clear evidence of a binary distribution in the abundances is detected.\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Comparison of the n-capture abundances of six M15 targets to the Solar System rand s-only abundance distributions. The abundances of the three RGB stars (K341, K462,\nand K583) are signified by red symbols while the abundances of the three RHB stars (B009,\nB224, and B262) are designated by blue symbols. The solid black line denotes the r-process\nonly abundance pattern, which is scaled to the solar log \u000f(Eu), and the dotted green line\nindicates the s-process only abundance pattern, which is scaled to the solar log \u000f(Ba) (all\npredictions are taken from Sneden, Cowan, & Gallino 2008). The heavy element abundances\nof the M15 stars compare well to the r-process predictions, but not those of the s-process.\nNeither abundance distribution consistently matches the stellar abundances for the elements\nSr, Y, and Zr.\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Plot of the relative abundances of the light n-capture elements Sr, Y, and Zr as\nfunction of the traditional s-process indicator, Ba. All M15 stars from the current effort\nare shown. Also displayed are the abundance results from Otsuki et al. (2006) as well as\nthose for a few halo field stars (taken from various literature references; see text for further\ndetails). The correlation coefficient, r, is exhbited in each of the panels and as seen, Sr, Y ,\nand Zr demonstrate a clear anti-correlative behavior with Ba while La does not.\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Plot of the relative abundances of the light n-capture elements Sr, Y, and Zr as\nfunction of the traditional r-process indicator, Eu. All M15 stars from the current effort\nare shown. Also displayed are the abundance results from Otsuki et al. (2006) as well as\nthose for a few halo field stars (taken from various literature references; see text for further\ndetails). The correlation coefficient, r, is exhbited in each of the panels and as seen, Sr, Y ,\nand Zr demonstrate a clear anti-correlative behavior with Eu while La does not.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Upper panel: Comparison of synthetic and observed spectra for the Pb I transition\nat 4057.8 \u00c5 in the M15 K462 giant. Four incremental changes in abundance are shown for\nthe specified Pb feature. It is only possible to establish an upper limit of approximately log \u000f\n(Pb)\u2248 -0.35 for this star. A CH contaminant is present in the blue wing of the Pb transition\nand accounts for a definitive portion of the signal. Accordingly, it appears that the s-process\nelement Pb is nominally detected in K462. Lower Panel: Plot of [Pb/Eu] as a function of\n[Eu/Fe] for three M15 giants and 5 halo field stars. The empirically determined threshold\nratio, which indicates the occurrence of AGB enrichment, is shown by the short-dashed line\nat [Pb/Eu] \u2265 +0.3 (this value is taken from Roederer et al. 2010; see the text for further\ndetails). Notice that all of the M15 stars fall below this line (and correspondingly, should\nlack main s-process material).\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Comparison of the distribution [(Mg, Eu)/Fe] relative abundances as a function\nof metallicity for M15 targets (denoted by the blue and red circles) as well as for halo and\ndisk stars (signified by the green, filled circles). Field star data have been taken from large\nsample surveys (see the text for further information). As per convention, the dotted lines\nrepresent the Solar abundance ratios. In in the lower panel, the two dashed black lines\nindicate the approximate ranges of the [Eu/Fe] data. The spread in the [Mg/Fe] values is\nsmaller for M15 than that for the field. Yet for [Eu/Fe], the M15 scatter is comparable to\nthat of the field (for that particular metallicity).\n\n\f5300\n5750\n5600\n4950\n6200\n6000\n\n1.65\n2.40\n2.10\n1.30\n2.70\n2.70\n\n-2.50\n-2.50\n-2.50\n-2.50\n-2.50\n-2.50\n\n-2.25\n2.60\n2.85\n2.60\n1.90\n3.30\n2.90\n\n1.90\n\n2.00\n\n2.00\n\n4200\n4225\n4225\n4275\n4275\n4275\n5300\n5750\n5600\n5000\n6250\n6000\n\n0.15\n0.30\n0.15\n0.45\n0.15\n0.30\n1.65\n2.40\n2.10\n1.50\n2.70\n2.70\n\n-2.20\n-2.20\n-2.20\n-2.20\n-2.20\n-2.20\n-2.30\n-2.50\n-2.50\n-2.30\n-2.50\n-2.30\n\n[M/H]\n\n2.15\n1.85\n2.10\n2.00\n2.20\n1.90\n2.50\n2.75\n2.60\n1.70\n3.30\n2.70\n\nvturb [km/s]\n\nRGB V magnitues are taken from Cudworth (2011) and those for the RHB targets are obtained from Buonanno et al.
