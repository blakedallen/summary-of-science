Introduction\nBragg diffraction of cold atoms at propagating standing light waves is used in two distinct\nways, as Bragg spectroscopy to measure the momentum distribution of ultracold gases [1]\nand as beamsplitter for coherent atom optics [2]. Bragg spectroscopy has developed into\na powerful tool for measuring the dispersion relation and the dynamic structure factor of\ncold gases. It was used to observe the momentum distribution of trapped Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BEC) [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], the structure factor of molecular condensates [7] and to\nstudy signatures of vortices [8, 9]. Furthermore, the technique is discussed for measuring\nthe dynamic structure factor in the presence of long-range particle correlations, such as\nsuperfluid pairing in a Fermi gas or fermionic condensation [10, 11, 12].\nBecause Bragg diffraction coherently couples two momentum states, it is frequently\nused as a beamsplitter for matter waves in interferometric experiments [13]. A BEC\nseems the optimal candidate for such an interferometer, because the macroscopically\npopulated wavefunction yields a high interferometric contrast. Consequently, a number\nof interferometric experiments have been done using Bragg diffraction of a BEC, e.g.\n[14, 15]. However, in the case of a BEC, the two momentum states resulting from the\nBragg diffraction interact with each other via s-wave collisions [16]. This interaction\nis prominently observed in time-of-flight (TOF) absorption images as a halo forming\nbetween the diffraction peaks. The typical lifetime of coherent superposition states due\nto interatomic interactions therefore is limited to only a few tens of microseconds [17].\nSuch experiments are thus performed during TOF or in very weak traps.\nSuperposition states in a Fermi gas, however, can live for a very long time as has\nbeen observed for potassium atoms in an optical lattice [18]. Since fermions do not\ninterfere, the matter wave contrast is necessarily limited to single-particle interference,\nbut the long coherence lifetime nevertheless makes fermions excellent candidates for\ninterferometric experiments.\nIn this paper we report on Bragg diffraction of ultracold fermions from a light\ngrating realized by two slightly detuned counterpropagating laser beams. The diffraction\nwas analyzed by studying Rabi oscillations between the two coupled momentum states\nfor low intensities of the Bragg lasers. Increasing the intensity of the Bragg light\neventually leads to Kapitza-Dirac scattering. We also studied the transition between\nBragg and Kapitza-Dirac scattering. Here, the system is no longer well described as\n\n\fCONTENTS\n\n3\n\na two-level system and a multilevel ansatz has to be used. Experimental results of\nscattering in the Kapitza-Dirac regime and their theoretical description are presented.\nFurthermore, we used Bragg spectroscopy to map the momentum distribution of\n6\nthe Li cloud. As there is no interaction between identical fermions in the ultracold\nregime, the momentum distribution directly reflects the thermal distribution given by\nthe Fermi-Dirac statistics. With a temperature of T /TF = 0.6 the onset of degeneracy\ncan be found by comparing Maxwell-Boltzmann and Fermi-Dirac fits to the measured\nmomentum distribution [19].\nThe diffracted momentum states oscillate in the trap for several seconds nearly\nunperturbed, which is only possible because of suppression of s-wave collisions due to\nthe Pauli principle. Higher partial waves are frozen out at the ultralow temperatures\nrealized in the experiment. The oscillation is eventually destroyed by dephasing due\nto the anharmonicity of the trap. Furthermore, the lifetime of oscillating atoms is\ndramatically reduced in the presence of 87 Rb atoms that collide with the 6 Li atoms.\nWe also report on Ramsey interferometry with ultracold fermions, based on Bragg\ndiffraction of trapped 6 Li atoms. A complete Ramsey spectrum can be taken in a\nsingle experimental cycle and is recorded by absorption imaging after TOF. We observe\nRamsey fringes for holding times of more than 30 \u03bcs. For longer times, the fringes\ncannot be resolved by the imaging system.\nThe limitation can be overcome by echo techniques similar as in NMR [20]. This\nmethod has already been applied in atomic beam experiments [13] as well as in\ninterferometric experiments with BECs [15]. In our experiment a diffraction echo is\ngenerated by a two-photon Bragg pulse located halfway in time between the Ramsey\npulses. Hence, we realize a motional wavepacket echo by optical means in a similar way\nas it is done in a Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 interferometer [21]. Our paper extends previous work\npresented in [22].\n2. Experimental procedure\nTo achieve simultaneous quantum degeneracy of 6 Li and 87 Rb, we use a procedure\ndetailed in previous papers [22, 23]. 6 Li atoms provided by a Zeeman slower and\n87\nRb atoms ejected from dispensers [24] are simultaneously collected by a magnetooptical trap. They are subsequently transferred via several intermediate magnetic traps\ninto a Ioffe-Pritchard type trap, where they are stored in their respective hyperfine\nstates |F, mF i = |3/2, 3/2i and |2, 2i. This (compressed) trap is characterized by the\nsecular frequencies (\u03c9x , \u03c9y , \u03c9z )/2\u03c0 = (762, 762, q\n190) Hz for 6 Li and the magnetic field\noffset 3.5 G. For 87 Rb the trap frequencies are 87/6 times lower. The 87 Rb cloud is\nselectively cooled by microwave-induced forced evaporation and serves as a cooling agent\nfor the 6 Li cloud, which adjusts its temperature to the 87 Rb cloud through interspecies\nthermalization. However, due to the small interspecies scattering length, a = \u221220 aB\n[23, 25], the thermalization is slow. Therefore, at low temperatures, when the size\nof the evaporated 87 Rb cloud becomes small or in shallow traps, where the different\n\n\f4\n\nCONTENTS\n\ngravitational sag separates the two species, the clouds thermally decouple. For the\nexperiments described below, we typically reach temperatures of below 1 \u03bcK with 2.5*106\n87\nRb atoms and 1.5 \u03bcK with 2*105 6 Li atoms. The respective densities are 2*1013 cm\u22123 for\n87\nRb and 4*1012 cm\u22123 for 6 Li, which corresponds to the critical temperature Tc = 0.7 \u03bcK\nand the Fermi-temperature TF = 2.4 \u03bcK.\n\nFigure 1. Schematics of a Bragg diffraction experiment. (a) Dispersion parabola\nof (quasi-) free particles. Shown is the initial Gaussian momentum distribution of\nthe atoms and the Bragg transition between the initial state 1 and the final state\n2 with a momentum shift of 2h\u0304q. (b) Typical pulse sequence of a Bragg diffraction\nexperiment. For single-pulse experiments only the first Bragg pulse is applied. For\na Ramsey experiment two \u03c0/2 pulses are used. For a diffraction echo experiment, a\nthird pulse (shaded area) is centered between the Ramsey pulses.\n\nFor most experiments (unless stated otherwise) we use a decompressed magnetic\ntrap with trap frequencies (\u03c9x , \u03c9y , \u03c9z )/2\u03c0 = (236, 180, 141) Hz. Decompression lowers\nthe temperatures of the clouds, but increases their gravitational sags. 6 Li is much\nlighter than 87 Rb, so that the two clouds separate in space, and the 6 Li cloud thermally\ndecouples from the 87 Rb cloud. Since 6 Li cannot thermalize by itself, the adiabatic\ncooling upon decompression becomes anisotropic. The temperature measured along the\nz-axis, along which the Bragg diffraction is performed, is then Tz \u2243 0.9 \u03bcK.\n2.1. Bragg diffraction\nThe 6 Li atoms are Bragg-diffracted by means of two counterpropagating laser beams\naligned along the z-axis of the Ioffe-Pritchard trap. The laser beams are frequencyshifted by acousto-optic modulators (AOM). One AOM is driven by a stable quartz\noscillator at 100 MHz. The other AOM is driven by a voltage-controlled oscillator,\nwhich is phase-locked to the quartz oscillator by means of an electronic feedback loop.\nThe frequencies of the two laser beams are set to differ by an amount \u03b4 = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91 =\n2h\u0304q 2 /m = 2\u03c0 * 295 kHz, with q = 2\u03c0/\u03bb and \u03bb is the resonant wavelength of the D2 line\nof 6 Li. The Bragg beams have intensities of I1 = I2 = 13.7 ... 132 mW/cm2 . The laser\nfrequencies are tuned \u2206L /2\u03c0 \u2243 1 GHz red to the D2 line, so that the two-photon Rabi\nfrequency reaches values between \u03a9R = 3\u03c0c2 \u0393I/h\u0304\u03c9 3 \u2206L \u2243 2\u03c0 * 47 ... 450 kHz. The pulse\n\n\f5\n\nCONTENTS\n\nduration is chosen to generate specific pulse areas \u03a6 = \u03a9R \u03c4 /2\u03c0. In most experiments,\nbefore applying the Bragg pulse, the 87 Rb atoms are removed from the trap by means of\na resonant light pulse. After the Bragg pulse we wait for a time tw before switching off\nthe trapping field and recording absorption images revealing the momentum distribution\nof the 87 Rb and 6 Li clouds. In some (Ramsey) experiments, we apply a second Bragg\npulse separated from the first one by a time interval \u2206t, or even a third one at half time\nbetween the two others (see figure 1).\n(a)\n0\n(b)\n)\n\n0.4\n(c)\n0.7\n(d)\n\n1\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\nkz (q)\n\n2\n\nFigure 2.

Theoretical model\n3.1. Free particles\nWe describe our experimental observations with the following model [26]. We assume\nthat during a Bragg pulse only two discrete momentum states j = 0, 1 of an atom are\ncoupled and that the impact of the trapping potential can be neglected. This is justified\nfor sequences much shorter than the trap oscillation period, i.e. \u03c4, \u2206t \u226a 2\u03c0/\u03c9z .

They correspond to atoms\nwith initial momentum h\u0304kz that are coupled to states with momentum h\u0304kz\u2032 = h\u0304(kz + 2q).\nThe time evolution of the amplitudes under the action of the Bragg light is given by the\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\na0,kz (t)\na1,kz (t)\n\n!\n\na0,kz (0)\na1,kz (0)\n\n\u2212iH\u03c4 t/h\u0304\n\n=e\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the Hamiltonian\nH\u03c4 =\n\nh\u0304 2\nk\n2m z\n1\n\u03a9\n2 R\n\n1\n\u03a9\n2 R\nh\u0304 \u20322\nk \u2212\n2m z\n\n\u03b4\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nWhen the Bragg light is turned off, the Hamiltonian simplifies to\nh\u0304 2\nk\n2m z\n\nH\u2206t =\n\n0\n\n0\nh\u0304 \u20322\nk\n2m z\n\n\u2212\u03b4\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nBy concatenating time evolutions described by e\u2212iH\u03c4 t/h\u0304 and e\u2212iH\u2206t t/h\u0304 the phase evolution\nof individual atoms in a superposition of momentum states can be calculated for\narbitrary sequences of pulses separated by times of free evolution, e.g. Ramsey type\nsequences.\nInitially the atoms are inhomogeneously distributed in momentum space. This\ndistribution is governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the temperature range of our\nexperiments (T /TF \u2265 0.6) however, the distribution does not deviate much from\nMaxwell-Boltzmann statistics, such that the momentum distribution can be assumed as\n2 2\nkz /2mkB T\n\n\u03c6(kz ) = h\u0304/ (2\u03c0mkB T )1/2 e\u2212h\u0304\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nTo obtain the momentum distribution of the atoms after an applied pulse sequence, we\ncalculate the evolution of the amplitudes aj,kz for a variety of initial momenta and weight\nthe final populations of the momentum states with the distribution function \u03c6(kz ). The\nnumber of atoms in the zeroth and first order Bragg-diffracted modes is then\nNj (t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(kz ) |aj,kz (t)|2 dkz .\n\n(5)\n\nThe procedure neglects atomic interactions, which certainly is a good assumption for\nan ultracold Fermi gas [27].\n3.2. Trapped particles\nIf trapped atoms are considered, the problem arises that the momentum eigenstates are\nsimultaneously coupled by two interactions, the moving optical lattice and the harmonic\ntrap. However, the situation is simplified, if a separation of scales is possible. In general,\nthe duration of a pulse is very short, \u03c4 \u226a 2\u03c0/\u03c9z . In contrast, the duration of a waiting\ntime period \u2206t can be such that it is no more negligible compared to a trap oscillation\nperiod. For these time intervals, the action of the trapping potential must explicitly be\ntaken into account.\nBecause the trap couples the atomic momenta and positions, the initial spatial\ndistribution of the atoms must now be considered. For simplicity we describe it\n\n\f7\n\nCONTENTS\n\nas a thermal Gaussian function, similar as done in Equation (4) for the momentum\ndistribution,\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8(z) = m\u03c9z2 /2\u03c0kB T\n\n\u00111/2\n\n2 2 /2k\n\ne\u2212m\u03c9z z\n\nBT\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nStarting from initial positions z and momenta kz , a diffraction pulse transfers the recoil\n2q to a part of the atoms. If the pulse length is short enough, the atomic position is not\naltered. The atoms then follow the classical trajectories\nh\u0304\u03c9z\nz sin \u03c9z t ,\n(7)\nk\u0303z (t) = kz cos \u03c9z t \u2212\nm\nh\u0304\u03c9z\nk\u0303z\u2032 (t) = (kz + 2q) cos \u03c9z t \u2212\nz sin \u03c9z t ,\nm\nwhere the first expression holds for undiffracted atoms and the second for diffracted\natoms. These values are used instead of kz and kz\u2032 respectively, in the Hamiltonians (2)\nand (3). As the Bragg pulses are short compared to the oscillation period, \u03c4 \u226a 2\u03c0/\u03c9z ,\nthe effect of the trapping potential can be neglected for the description of the Bragg\ndiffraction. This means that the Hamiltonian H\u03c4 depends on k\u0303z (t), but can be treated\nas time-independent during the short time intervals \u03c4 . In contrast, the free propagation\nHamiltonian H\u2206t gets time-dependent if \u2206t is long. In this case, the phase evolution\nof the atoms in both coupled momentum states can be described by writing the timeevolution operator as\n\uf8eb\n\ne\u2212iH\u2206t t/h\u0304 = \uf8ed\n\n\u0010\n\nexp \u2212i\n\nRt\n\nh\u0304 2\n0 dt 2m k\u0303z (t)\n\n0\n\n\u0011\n\n0\n\u0010\n\nexp \u2212i\n\nRt\n0\n\ndt\n\nh\n\nh\u0304 \u20322\nk\u0303 (t)\n2m z\n\n\u2212\u03b4\n\n\uf8f6\n\ni\u0011 \uf8f8\n\n. (8)\n\nSince the amplitudes aj,z,kz now also depend on the initial atomic positions, the\nfinal populations of the momentum states must additionally be weighted by the initial\nspatial distribution. Therefore, Equation (5) for the expectation values of the diffracted\nand non-diffracted atom numbers now reads\nNj (t) =\n\nZZ\n\n\u03c6(kz )\u03c8(z) |aj,z,kz (t)|2 dkz dz .\n\n(9)\n\n4. Single pulse experiments\n4.1. Bragg diffraction\nWe first study diffraction with a single Bragg pulse. Having applied a pulse of a given\nlength, we observe an axial modulation of the momentum distribution. This is due\nto the fact that different velocity classes of the atomic clouds have different Doppler\nshifts with respect to the Bragg lasers and therefore are subject to different Rabi\nflopping frequencies. The initial momentum distribution thus leads to an inhomogeneous\npopulation of the two momentum states after the pulse.\nFor small pulse areas \u03a6 only momenta around h\u0304kz = 0 are diffracted. With\nincreasing \u03a6 nonresonant velocity classes are also coupled by the Bragg beams as can be\nseen in figure 3(a) and (c).

The measured difference between the number of atoms in the first and\nzeroth order normalized to the total atom number is shown in figure 4 (crosses) as a\nfunction of pulse duration. The observed damped Rabi oscillations are reproduced by\ntheory doing the same integration for the simulated momentum distribution according\nto Equation (5), as can be seen in figure 4 as a (red) dashed line. Note that the damping\nis solely due to the initial inhomogeneous momentum distribution, decoherence was not\nincluded in the simulations.\n4.2.

The\nresulting dynamics can be described by a simple extension of the model detailed in\nSection 3. In particular the Hamiltonian (2) is replaced by\n\uf8eb\n\nH\u03c4 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n..\n..\n\n.\n.\n\n..\n\n\uf8f6\n\n.\n\nh\u0304(kz \u22122q)2\n2m\n\u03a9R\n2\n\n+\u03b4\n\n\u03a9R\n2\nh\u0304kz2\n2m\n\u03a9R\n2\n\n\u03a9R\n2\nh\u0304(kz +2q)2\n2m\n\n..\n\n.\n\n\u2212\u03b4\n\n..\n\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nThe crossover from the Bragg-diffraction regime to Kapitza-Dirac scattering is a smooth\ntransition. As we will see below, for intermediate Rabi frequencies (here 1 MHz >\n\u03a9R /2\u03c0 > 100 kHz) the neighboring diffraction states, corresponding to momentum\nshifts of 4h\u0304q and \u22122h\u0304q (second and minus first order), are scarcely populated. For\nincreasingly higher Rabi frequencies, \u03a9R /2\u03c0 > 1 MHz, the scattering populates more\nand more diffraction orders.\nWe performed Bragg-diffraction at the transition between the Bragg and KapitzaDirac regime by increasing the Bragg laser intensity beyond the value used in\nthe experiments discussed in the previous sections. Figure 5(a) shows the atomic\ndistribution as a function of \u03a6 after 2 ms TOF for such an experiment. A simulation\n\n\f10\n\nCONTENTS\n\n)\n\nusing Equation (12) is shown in figure 5(b).

(a) False color map of measured momentum distributions similar to figure 3.\nThe Rabi frequency was chosen such that the system is approaching the Kapitza-Dirac\nregime. While the main diffraction is between the momentum states of 0h\u0304q and 2h\u0304q\n(zeroth and first order diffraction states), diffraction into the \u22122h\u0304q and 4h\u0304q states\nalso occur.

Momentum distribution of the trapped 6 Li cloud measured by Bragg\nspectroscopy. The blue (solid) line is a Gaussian fit to the data, revealing a temperature\nof 1.5 \u03bcK. The red (dashed) line is a simulated Fermi-Dirac momentum distribution\nfor 2 * 105 atoms at 1.4 \u03bcK. These two curves are nearly indistinguishable in the plot.\n\nFigure 6 shows a spectrum resulting from such a series of measurements, performed\nin the compressed trap. In this experiment, the pulse duration was chosen such that\nthe pulse area was \u03a6 \u2243 0.5. The frequency detuning of the two Bragg lasers was\nchanged between 40 kHz and 550 kHz in 15 kHz steps, which is small compared to the\nRabi frequency \u03a9R \u2243 2\u03c0 * 58 kHz. In figure 6 the amount of scattered atoms is plotted\nversus the resonant atomic momentum derived from Equation (14). The data show a\ndistinctive Gaussian shape, corresponding to the temperature T = 1.50 \u03bcK \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcK\n(blue, solid curve), in good agreement with TOF measurements.\nAt low temperatures T \u226a TF , the momentum distribution is expected to deviate\nfrom a Gaussian profile and to adopt the shape of an inverted parabola. However, in our\nexperiments the temperatures were not far below the Fermi temperature of TF \u2243 2.4 \u03bcK.\nIn this regime, the distributions, integrated in the two dimensions perpendicular to the\nz-axis, have quite similar shapes. A fit based on a Fermi-Dirac distribution for 1.8 * 105\natoms is also shown in figure 6 as red (dashed) curve. This fit yields a temperature of\nT = 1.39 \u03bcK \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcK.\nThe two curves, for the Gaussian and the Fermi-Dirac distribution are nearly\ncongruent. Although the shape of the momentum distribution thus provides no clear\nsignal for degeneracy in this regime, the result suggests that the temperatures due to\nGaussian fits are overestimated by 5..10 %.\nBragg spectroscopy yields the same information as standard TOF absorption\nimaging. However, this technique reveals the momentum distribution inside the trap.\nAdiabatic cooling and magnetic field distortions during trap switch-off do not affect the\nsignal, which is particularly important for light and fast atoms such as lithium.\n\n\f12\n\nCONTENTS\n4.4. Trap dynamics\n\nBy Bragg diffraction the atoms acquire additional momentum and begin to oscillate\ninside the trap. This oscillation has been analyzed in the following experiment. A\nfraction of the atoms, stored in the compressed trap, is Bragg-scattered by a single\n\u03c0-pulse. The atoms are then held inside the trap for variable holding times tw before\nbeing imaged (see figure 7).\nSeveral observations are made: If no 87 Rb is in the trap, the 6 Li atoms oscillate\nfor times on the order of seconds; however, the distribution of the diffracted atoms\nsmears out. Also, the oscillation period of the diffracted atoms differs from the period\nof undiffracted atoms. The momentum distribution of these undiffracted atoms is\ndepleted around kz = 0, because atoms in low momentum states are Bragg-scattered\npreferentially. Atoms in the zeroth order oscillate with an average amplitude given by\nthe width of the thermal distribution of the original cloud, as can be seen in figure 7.\n\n5\n\n505\n\nt\n\nw\n\n(ms)\n\n500\n\n10\n510\n\u22122\n\n0\nk (q)\n\n2\n\nz\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\nk (q)\nz\n\nFigure 7. Momentum distribution after a \u03c0-pulse and a variable waiting time tw\nin the trap. Diffracted and undiffracted atoms oscillate in a potential given in good\napproximation by Equation (15). The equation of motion for this oscillation has been\ncomputed and is shown as (white and magenta) curves. The oscillation period for the\ntwo amplitudes differ, as can be seen for large waiting times tw \u226b 2\u03c0/\u03c9z . The (red)\nlines indicate the area in which the atom numbers were counted for analysis in figure 8.\n\nThe broadening of the momentum distribution as well as the different oscillation\nperiods for the two diffraction orders are due to anharmonicities in the magnetic trap.\nThe magnetic potential of the trap is a combination of the quadrupole field generated\nby a pair of coils in anti-Helmholtz configuration and the field generated by four wires\nparallel to the rotational axes of the coils. The numerically calculated field geometry is\nin very good approximation given by [28]\nBz (z) = B0 \u2212 \u03b1(z + a) + \u03b2a2 ez/a ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith the gradient \u03b1, the curvature \u03b2 and a = \u03b1/\u03b2. With the resulting potential, the\noscillation of the atoms in the cloud can be numerically simulated and compared to\nthe anharmonic motion observed in the experiment. From this we derive values of\n\u03b1 = 135 G/cm \u00b1 25 G/cm for the gradient and \u03b2 = 1.402 * 103 G/cm2 \u00b1 4 G/cm2 for the\n\n\f13\n\nCONTENTS\nq\n\ncurvature, leading to the trap frequency \u03c9z = \u03bcB \u03b2z /m = 2\u03c0 * 181.6 Hz. The numerical\ncalculation of the magnetic field configuration confirms the measured gradient [28].\nSimple harmonic fits to the oscillation result in the same oscillation frequency with an\nerror better than 10\u22122 . This implies that the effect of the anharmonicity on the atomic\nmotion is less than 1%.\n\nFigure 8. Rephasing of the momentum distribution in the trap in the absence (a) and\nin the presence (b) of 87 Rb. Plotted are the integrated numbers of Bragg-diffracted\natoms found at a given time tw after an initial Bragg \u03c0-pulse in a restricted area of the\nmomentum space. The fit is a combination of an error function with linearly increasing\nGaussian width and an exponential damping of the peak height. This damping is best\nobserved in (c), where the integrated number of atoms in each peak is plotted versus\ntime in a logarithmic plot. Only small damping is observed in the absence of 87 Rb\n(black, dash-dotted curve), while the presence of 87 Rb induces a fast damping (red,\ndashed curve).\n\nWe also analyzed the data by counting the number of atoms in a certain area\nof momentum space. This area was chosen as a box completely encompassing the\ndiffracted atomic cloud at their highest momentum as indicated by the (red) lines in\nfigure 7. The result of this analysis is shown in figure 8. Here, the fraction of atoms\nin the evaluation area relative to the total number of atoms is plotted as a function of\ntime. The peaks are separated by a trap period and represent a revival of the original\nmomentum distribution, directly after the Bragg pulse. For the fit in figure 8 (red\ndashed curve) we assume a Gaussian cloud shape oscillating in and out of the detection\nvolume. The convolution of the Gaussian and the rectangular shape of the detection\nvolume is described by a combination of two error functions with opposite slopes shifted\nwith respect to each other by the time it takes for the cloud to oscillate in and out of\nthe detection volume. The steepness of the slopes is given by the width of the cloud,\n\n\fCONTENTS\n\n14\n\nand this feature is repeated every trap period.\nAs one can see from figure 8(a), the width \u03c3 of the cloud's Gaussian momentum\ndistribution broadens with time. If we assume a linear broadening, the fit to the data\nyields\nt\n(16)\n\u03c3(t) = \u03c30 (1 + 5 * 10\u22126 )\n\u03bcs\nwhere \u03c30 is the initial width. This broadening is the main reason for the reduction in\namplitude and is due to the anharmonicity of the trap. The integrated number of atoms\nin each peak, on the other hand, decreases much slower. This can be seen in figure 8(c),\nwhere the integrated number of atoms per peak is plotted against time. In the absence\nof 87 Rb we find a damping time of 3.2 s corresponding to more than 500 oscillations \u2021.\nThe exponential decrease of the atom number is due to p-wave collisions between\ndiffracted and undiffracted atoms, since s-wave collisions are forbidden for a spinpolarized Fermi gas. The damping time therefore corresponds to a collision rate of\n\u03b3coll 6p = 0.3 Hz. From this the p-wave scattering cross section can be calculated\n[23, 29]. Here we assume a Gaussian density distribution for the undiffracted atoms\nand a harmonic oscillation of the diffracted atoms. The relative scattering velocity\nvsc = 2h\u0304q/m in this system corresponds to a scattering energy of 5 \u03bcK * kB . We derive\na p-wave scattering cross section of \u03c3p = 1.4 * 10\u221213 cm2 , which agrees with similar\nmeasurements performed on 40 K [27] and calculations made for 6 Li [30].\nIn the presence of a cloud of 87 Rb, we find a dramatic reduction of the damping\ntime, as can be seen in figure 8(b) and (c). The 6 Li atoms may collide with 87 Rb atoms if\nthese are not initially removed from the trap. The collision time constant calculated from\n\u22121\nthe heteronuclear s-wave scattering length [23] is \u03b3coll\n6,87 = 107 ms. The exponential\ndamping in the fit of figure 8(b) and (c) resulted in a damping time of 113 ms, while\nthe broadening is of the same order as in the case without 87 Rb. There is excellent\nagreement between the calculated collision rate and the observed damping.\n5. Atomic coherences\n5.1. Ramsey interferometry\nThe observed revivals of the density distributions after long times indicate that the 6 Li\natoms are free from any kind of perturbation, which in turn suggests long decoherence\ntimes for quantum mechanical superpositions. The existence and the stability of such\nstates can be tested by interferometric experiments.\nTo this end, we apply a Ramsey sequence of two \u03c0/2 pulses, like in an atomic MachZehnder (or Ramsey-Bord\u00e9) type interferometer. The beamsplitters are Bragg pulses\nwith a duration equivalent to a pulse area of \u03a6 = 0.25, and the interferometric paths\n\u2021 In the decompressed trap, we found damping times without 87 Rb atoms exceeding 13 s, which is on\nthe order of the magnetic trap lifetime. However, in those traps the presence of a 87 Rb cloud has no\nimpact on the 6 Li because of gravitational sag.\n\n\f15\n\nCONTENTS\n\nare closed by the kinetic energy released during time-of-flight. We proceed as follows.\nAt time t = 0 in the decompressed trap, a first \u03c0/2 pulse of duration \u03c4 is applied. Then\nwe wait for a variable amount of time \u2206t after which a second \u03c0/2 pulse is applied. The\nmomentum distribution is recorded after the delay of half a trap cycle and 2 ms ballistic\nexpansion.

The temperature used\nfor the simulation is T = 1.2 \u03bcK and the Rabi frequency is \u03a9R = 2\u03c0 * 58 kHz.\n\nThe initial momentum distribution of the atoms gives rise to an inhomogeneous\nDoppler shift, which detunes the atoms from Bragg resonance. This allows to observe\nall Ramsey fringes in a single shot. We do observe Ramsey fringes for time separations\nof the Ramsey pulses on the order of up to 30 \u03bcs. For longer times, the fringe spacing\nfalls below the resolution limit of the imaging system.\nUsing Equation (3) the phase difference for the two momentum states of an atom\nmoving at velocity h\u0304kz /m accumulated after a time \u2206t is given by\n2h\u0304(q + kz )q\n\u2206t \u2212 \u03b4 .\n(17)\nm\nAdjacent fringes are produced by atoms whose velocities differ by an amount h\u0304\u2206kz /m\nsuch that \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0, yielding the condition\n\u03c0\nh\u0304\u2206kz\n=\n.\n(18)\nm\nq\u2206t\n\u03c6=\n\n\fCONTENTS\n\n16\n\nAfter ballistic expansion time during a time ttof the fringes are separated in space by an\namount \u03c0ttof /q\u2206t, which must exceed the \u2206x = 14 \u03bcm resolution of our optical system.\nFrom this follows the condition for the maximum allowable Ramsey pulse separation,\n\u03c0ttof\n= 48 \u03bcs .\n(19)\n\u2206tmax =\n\u2206x * q\nThe realistic value is additionally subject to noise.\nTo a certain extent the contrast can be enhanced by longer TOFs. However this also\ndilutes the cloud and reduces the quality of the absorption image. Lower temperatures\nmay allow for longer TOFs, but as the temperature of the cloud is below the Fermi\ntemperature already, the width of the momentum distribution cannot be reduced by\nmuch due to the Pauli exclusion principle.\nThe maximum detectable evolution time could be slightly improved by a better\nimaging system, however, the general problem remains. It can be circumvented by an\necho technique described in the following section.\n5.2. Diffraction echo interferometry\nInterferometry of particle ensembles is subject to decoherence and dephasing.\nDecoherence destroys quantum mechanical superpositions due to coupling to a reservoir.\nIn contrast, dephasing results from divergent phase space trajectories for different\nparticles and may be reversed if the trajectories can be inverted [31]. This is possible\nwith echo techniques well known in NMR spectroscopy [20]. They have been successfully\napplied in cold atom experiments [13] and BEC interferometry [15]. In an echo\nexperiment the free evolution time between two Ramsey pulses is split in two intervals\nby an additional \u03c0-pulse inverting the phase evolution of atomic states. Diffraction echo\ninterferometry is robust against dephasing.\nIn our case the signature for diffraction echo is the almost complete revival of the\nzeroth order momentum state. Such an experiment is shown in figure 10. It is similar\nto the Ramsey experiment described above, but the waiting time between the pulses is\nnow divided into two waiting times \u03c41 (20 \u03bcs in figure 10(a)) and \u03c42 , separated by an\nadditional \u03c0-pulse. After completion of a pulse sequence, the atoms are held in the trap\nfor half a trap period, then the trap is turned off and the atoms are imaged after 2 ms\nballistic expansion time.\nThe Rabi frequency in this experiment is \u03a9R = 2\u03c0 * 220 kHz. This ensures Bragg\nresonance for all atoms according to Equation (10). However, for this Rabi frequency\nKapitza-Dirac scattering already occurs, as can be seen in figure 10. For times \u03c42 6= \u03c41\nthe zero-momentum revival is incomplete, it appears as a central peak (dip) in the zeroth\n(first) order Bragg-diffracted portion. This peak (dip) broadens until for \u03c42 = \u03c41 the\nrevival is most pronounced. This effect is also seen in figure 10(b), where the difference\nbetween atom numbers in the zeroth and first diffracted state is shown.\nThe revival is seen for times up to \u03c4tot = \u03c41 + \u03c42 =100 \u03bcs. In a harmonic trapping\npotential momentum states are no eigenstates, which leads to a mixing of position and\n\n\f17\n\nCONTENTS\n(a)\n\n1.6\n\n\u03c4 =14\u03bcs\n\n(b)\n\n1.4 \u03c4 =20\u03bcs\n\n2\n\ntot\n\n(N \u2212N )/N\n\n1\n\n1\n\n20\u03bcs\n\n30\u03bcs\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\ndensity (arb. units)\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n40\u03bcs\n\n0.4\n26\u03bcs\n0.2\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nkz (q)\n\n2\n\n0\n\u221210\n\n50\u03bcs\n0\n\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 (\u03bcs)\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFigure 10.

This process is responsible for the\ndecay of the diffraction echo rather than decoherence. The coherent theoretical model\nbased on Equation (8) fully describes the experimental observation, which leads us to\nclaim \u03c4tot as a lower bound for the coherence time.\nSetting the waiting times to a multiple of the oscillation period \u03c41 = \u03c42 = 2\u03c0n/\u03c9z\ncan compensate the effect of the trapping potential as has been shown in [32]. In our\nexperimental setup, revivals of the diffraction echo could not be observed. This might\nbe due to the large momentum spread of the initial cloud.\n6. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we presented Bragg scattering of fermions from a moving optical lattice.\nWe were able to show the coherence between the zeroth and first order diffracted\nmomentum states. Our work presents the first study of interferometry with fermionic\natoms using separate interferometric arms and a variable evolution time. The coherence\nis also observed with a diffraction echo experiment, where a lower bound for the\ncoherence time of ttot > 100 \u03bcs was found. A longer observation was hampered by\nthe fact that the studied momentum states are no eigenstates of the harmonic trapping\npotential. The diffracted atoms, however, oscillate in the trapping potential for very long\ntimes with a single atom damping time of about 3.2 s. This leads us to the assumption of\na similarly long coherence time, which is consistent with the observation made by Roati\net al. [18]. Thus fermionic 6 Li is a promising candidate for interferometric experiments\n\n\fCONTENTS\n\n18\n\nwith long coherence times using schemes similar to [15].\nMoreover, we successfully applied Bragg spectroscopy to fermions, measuring the\nmomentum distribution of an ultracold degenerate Fermi gas. Although not deep in the\ndegenerate regime (T /TF = 0.6), the momentum distribution revealed signs of quantum\ndegeneracy. For even lower temperatures it is conceivable to observe degeneracy from\nthe shape of the distribution directly. In addition, Bragg spectroscopy allows for in-situ\nprobing of specific momentum classes of trapped atoms.\nFuture work will be devoted to studying the 87 Rb+6 Li mixture in a crossed\nbeam dipole trap, using Bragg scattering in the vicinity of one of the recently found\nheteronuclear Feshbach resonances [33]. Signatures of the interaction energy of the\nensemble should be visible in the profile of a Bragg spectrum, similar to the frequency\nshift observed in Bragg spectroscopy on BECs [1]. Furthermore, Bragg spectroscopy\npermits to measure the atomic dispersion relation, which is particularly interesting in\ncase of many-body correlations. Bragg spectroscopy should also be applicable to take\nexcitation spectra of fermionic spin mixtures in the BEC-BCS crossover regime which\ncould be realized in our experiment as well.\n\nAcknowledgements\nDuring the completion of this paper, we learned that Bragg spectroscopy on fermionic\nspin mixtures has been done in Tokyo [34] and Melbourne [35].
