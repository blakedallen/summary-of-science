The first\nsix sections are introductory, presenting the notations and general group theoretical methods applied to SU(3). The following eight sections are devoted\nto a detailed treatment of the carrier spaces of the irreducible representations\nand their direct product.\n\nI. Introduction\nThe first applications of the SU(3) group theory have occurred in nuclear\nphysics, following the attempts to describe the nuclear collective properties\nin the frame of the shell model. The complex problem of the states classification and determination of the energy spectrum was simplified by using the\ndynamical symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This is reflected by certain regularities observed in the spectra, and indicates the existence of a set of operators\nwhich commute with the many-body Hamiltonian and generate a Lie algebra.\nBecause the new \"constants of motion\" are not related to the already present\ngeometrical symmetries of the physical system, the spectrum shows an additional degeneracy. The subspace of the states with the same energy carries\na representation of this extended algebra, integrable to the Lie group of dynamical symmetry. The group SU(3) represents the dynamical symmetry\nof the isotropic 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator, whose degenerate energy\n1\n\npublished in Romanian in St. Cerc. Fiz. 36, 3 (1984)\n\n1\n\n\feigenstates provide the basis of a space of irreducible representation (irrep).\nThe irreducible spaces and representations will be denoted by V (P, Q) and\nD(P, Q), respectively, where P and Q are positive integers. The classification of the harmonic oscillator states may be obtained by using the complete\nset of commuting operators, whose eigenvalues are the indices of the basis\nvectors of the SU(3) irreducible representations [1] ch. 13. The classification\nof the states of the nucleon system in the harmonic oscillator potential was\nobtained by Elliott [2], and it was applied to the light nuclei. Bargmann\nand Moshinsky have considered in addition to the harmonic oscillator potential also the residual two-particle interaction [3]- [5]. This Hamiltonian is\nSU(3)-invariant, and to obtain the eigenfunctions of a system consisting of 3\nnucleons it is necessary to know the SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients\nfor the product D(P, Q) \u2297 D(P1 , 0).\nThe coupling of the oscillator wave functions in the 2s-1d shell was obtained by Hecht [6] by using the CG coefficients for the products\nD(P, Q) \u2297 D(P1 , 0) , D(P, Q) \u2297 D(P1 , 1) , D(P, Q) \u2297 D(0, Q1 ) . (1)\nFor even-even nuclei was used with success the interacting boson model [7].\nIn this model only the symmetry of the valence nucleons is considered, supposing that they are coupled in s and d- boson pairs. At a fixed number of\nbosons the most general Hamiltonian of this system has the SU(6) symmetry,\nand the states are labeled by the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators for a\nsubgroup chain of SU(6). There are only three possible subgroup chains, one\nof them starting with SU(3). The energy levels calculated by using this chain\nare in a good agreement with the experiment for the nuclei with half-filled\nvalence shell. In this case the SU(3) symmetry describes rotational spectra,\nand is independent of the degeneracy of the single-particle levels.\nThe importance of the simple Lie group theory for the elementary particle\nphysics was exposed in detail in ref. [8]. The discovery of the flavor quantum\nnumbers such as the isospin, hypercharge, charm, conserved by the strong\ninteractions has lead to the introduction of the dynamical symmetry models\nbased on SU(2), SU(3), and SU(4), respectively. These symmetries are only\napproximate, because the particles assigned to the multiplets have different\nmasses. However, the classification is correct, because the symmetry breaking interactions do not change the values of the internal quantum numbers.\nIn general, a hadronic model with nF constituent quarks (flavors) is related to the SU(nF ) symmetry. The nF quarks can be distinguished by the\n2\n\n\fvalues of a set of nF flavor quantum numbers. If there are no charmed particles, the hadronic systems are correctly described by the octet model, based\non the flavor symmetry group SU(3)F . A basic reference to this model and\nits applications is [9]. In this reference several tables of CG coefficients are\nincluded, and are used to calculate the matrix elements of the mass operator.\nThis leads to a relationship between the strengths of the coupling between\nthe pseudoscalar meson octet and the barionic currents in the case of the\nYukawa coupling. The tables are also used to express the hadronic wave\nfunctions in terms of quarks.\nThe SU(3) invariance of the strong interactions leads also to useful equations for the calculus of the multiplet dependent factor of the hadron scattering amplitude [10]. In a many-quark system, these amplitudes can be\nobtained only by knowing the CG series and coefficients for the direct product of two arbitrary representations.\nIn the octet model the barions are L\u03c0 = 0+ states of a three quark system, contradicting the expected behavior of a system of three particles of spin\n1/2, obeying the Fermi-Dirac statistics. This puzzling situation was solved\nby introducing the color quantum number taking three possible values, in\naddition to the flavor and Dirac spinor indices of the relativistic quark wave\nfunction [11]. The colored quarks are usual spin 1/2 Fermions, but unobservable, because by postulate, only the \"white\" systems can be free. The system\nof three colored quarks is antisymmetric to the permutation of the color indices, and is invariant to their transformation by SU(3). However, contrary\nto SU(3)F , the global color transformation group, SU(3)C , is an exact symmetry. Assuming that the quark Lagrangean is invariant not only to global,\nbut also to local SU(3)C transformations, it is possible to formulate a YangMills theory of the strong interactions, the quantum chromodynamics [12].\nAlthough based on SU(3), this theory does not rely on the SU(3) irreducible\nrepresentations, and the commutation relations between the gauge fields and\ncurrents are completely specified by su(3), the Lie algebra of SU(3).\nIn certain physical situations the SU(3) group is too restrictive, and it is\nnecessary to use larger semisimple Lie groups, as SU(n). The general theory of semisimple Lie groups was elaborated in the classical works of Cartan\nand Weyl [13]. The development of the quantum theory of angular momentum has determined the intensive study of SU(2). The results obtained by\nWigner [14] and Racah [15] in the theory of the SU(2) representation and\nirreducible tensor operators, have solved practically all the problems of the\n3\n\n\fatomic spectroscopy. The extension of these results to SU(n) was given in\nthe series of papers [16], by Baird abd Biedenharn. In ref. [16]-II the method\nof boson generators is applied to recover the general formulas of Gel'fand and\nZetlin for the matrix elements of the generators. A particular attention is\ngiven to SU(3), because in its study are encountered features characteristic\nfor SU(n) in general, but which are not revealed by the simple structure of\nSU(2). The last papers [16]- IV,V concern the calculus of the CG coefficients\nas matrix elements of the irreducible tensor operators in the Gel'fand basis,\nby using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The main difficulty, represented by the\noccurrence of the multiplicities, is solved by the classification of the tensor\noperators using a conjugation operation.\nThe computational method used to obtain the SU(3) and SU(4) CG\ncoefficients was presented in ref. [17], [18] and [19], respectively. An alternative procedure, based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, is presented in ref.\n[20]. There nonorthonormal isoscalar factors are calculated by using the recurrence formulas satisfyed by the matrix elements of the irreducible tensor\noperators.\nA general method for the calculus of the CG coefficients for every group\nSU(n), based on the properties of the projection operators associated to the\nmatrix elements of the irreducible representations is presented in ref. [1], ch.\n7. The CG coefficients obtained this way are expressed as linear combinations of integrals over the group parameters [21].\nThe products of Eq. (1) have been reduced by Hecht, using the recurrence\nformulas between the CG coefficients. Isoscalar factors of particular interest,\nas well as formulas for the general ones, have been derived in [22], by using\nexpansions of SU(3) invariant polynomials.\nThe results presented in these works solve completely the problems related to the SU(3) irreducible representations and the related CG coefficients.\nHowever, I have considered that a self-contained presentation of some of these\nresults, as well as of a simple and general method to calculate the isoscalar\nfactors, might be useful. The sections II-VI are devoted to the basic definitions. The notations used for the SU(3) algebra, its fundamental and general\ntensor representations, as well as the CG series, are introduced. The sections\nVII-IX contain a detailed study of the irrep spaces and their direct product,\nwhile in sect. X-XIV the formulas obtained before are applied to the explicit\ncalculation of the CG coefficients in particular situations of interest.\n\n4\n\n\fII. The SU(3) group\nThe group SU(3) consists of the linear unimodular transformations of the\ncomplex space C 3 which leave invariant the Hermitian bilinear form\n< a, b >= a\u22171 b1 + a\u22172 b2 + a\u22173 b3 , a, b \u2208 C 3 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe matrices of the unitary linear operators associated to these transformations in the basis\n{xj \u2208 C 3 , j = 1, 2, 3; < xj , xk >= \u03b4jk }\n\n(3)\n\nare unitary unimodular matrices U which give a 3-dimensional representation\nof the group SU(3). An analytic structure on this group can be introduced\nby considering the real and the imaginary part of the 9 complex elements of\nthe matrix U as analytical coordinates of a point in the space R18 . These 18\nreal parameters are constrained by 10 algebraic relations determined by the\nconditions\ndetU = 1 , UU \u2020 = I ,\n(4)\nsuch that only eight of them are independent. The remaining parameters\ncan be expressed as analytical functions of them, and therefore, SU(3) is a\nreal, eight-dimensional, analytical manifold.\nIf U1 , U2 \u2208 SU(3), then the coordinates of U = U1 U2\u22121 are analytical\nfunctions of the coordinates of U1 and U2 . Thus, SU(3) is a real Lie group.\nBy using the continuity of the matrix elements and Eq. (4) it can be\nshown that SU(3) is homeomorphic with a compact set in R8 [23]-IV. Moreover, it can be proved by recurrence that SU(n) is simply connected if\nSU(n \u2212 1) is simply connected [23]-(VIII sect. 4). As SU(1) = {I} is simply\nconnected, then every SU(n), and in particular SU(3), is simply connected.\nThe coordinates on SU(3), {qj , j = 1, 8}, are defined such that the origin\nof the space R8 corresponds to the unit matrix I. Their choice is simplified\nby the existence of the subgroups SU(2) and SUD(3) = D(3) \u2229 SU(3) (\nconsisting of the diagonal 3 \u00d7 3 unitary unimodular matrices), for which the\ncoordinates are known. The four remaining parameters are chosen usually in\nthe form given by Nelson [24]. Other parametrizations are given in [25]-[27].\nEvery SU(3) matrix can be obtained from the identity I by a series of\ninfinitesimal transformations corresponding to a continuous variation of the\n5\n\n\fgroup parameters, and can be represented in the form\ni\n\nU(q1 , ..., q8 ) = e 2\n\nP8\n\nq \u03bb\nk=1 k k\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe parameters qk , k = 1, 8 of this representation define a canonical system\nof coordinates [23]-(IX, sect. 3), and the matrices of the generators of the\ninfinitesimal transformations\n1\nFk = \u03bbk , k = 1, 8\n2\n\n(6)\n\ngive a representation in C 3 of the real Lie algebra su(3). These matrices are\nthe elements of a basis in the real linear space of the trace 0, 3 \u00d7 3 Hermitian\nmatrices.

Consequently, the\ncharacters for the elements of SU(3) will be analytical functions of the two\nvariables which parameterize SUD(3). An invariant measure, normalized in\nthe character space, can be found in [28].\nThe matrices \u03bb satisfy the relationship\n8\nX\n2\n(dijk + ifijk )\u03bbk .\n\u03bbi \u03bbj = \u03b4ij I +\n3\nk=1\n\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fHere dijk is a real, symmetric, tensor of order three, fijk is also real, but antisymmetric, and \u03b4ij is the Kronecker symbol.

The two commuting elements of su(3) are F3 and\nF8 , the basis in Eq. (3) being chosen such that their matrices are diagonal.\nTheir diagonal elements are related to the quantum numbers characteristic\nto the systems with SU(3) symmetry, and can be used to label the states.\nFor the hadron classification the states are labeled by the eigenvalues i3 and\ny of the operators I3 and Y ,\n2\nI3 = F3 , Y = \u221a F8 .\n3\n\n(14)\n\nThe structure constants cijk , i, j, k = 1, 8, defined by the commutation relations\n[iFj , iFk ] =\n\n8\nX\n\nj=1\n\n7\n\ncljk (iFl )\n\n(15)\n\n\fare cljk = \u2212fjkl .

Therefore the Killing form\n(X, Y ) =\n\n8\nX\n\ngij X i Y j\n\n(17)\n\ni,j=1\n\nis non-degenerate, negative definite, and the algebra su(3) is semisimple.\nThis means that su(3) contains no commutative ideal, and implies that SU(3)\nis also a semisimple Lie group [23], Ch. XI, sect. 4.\nThe properties summarized above show that SU(3) is a real, compact,\nsimply connected, semisimple Lie group. Such a group has no proper connected invariant subgroup, but it may have a discrete one. For SU(3) this\nsubgroup is\n2\n4\nZ3 = {I, e 3 i\u03c0 I, e 3 i\u03c0 I} .\n(18)\nThe factor group SU(3)/Z3 is obtained by identifying the elements of SU(3)\n4\n2\nwhich are different by a factor e 3 i\u03c0 or e 3 i\u03c0 , and is triply connected. This\nfactor group is important in the elementary particle physics, because only\nthe hadron states assigned to its irreps have integer charge and hypercharge.\nIII. The su(3) algebra\nThe linear representations theory of the semisimple Lie algebras L, and\nthe corresponding groups, rely on the decomposition of L in a direct sum of\ninvariant subspaces with respect to the restriction of the adjoint representation\nX \u2192 adX = [X, \u2217] , X \u2208 L\n(19)\nto the nilpotent subalgebra\n\nH = {X, Y \u2208 L/(adX )k Y = 0, 0 < k \u2208 Z} .\n\n(20)\n\nAn important example is provided by the Gauss decomposition, L = N + +\nH + N \u2212 , where N \u00b1 are nilpotent subalgebras, while N \u00b1 + H are solvable [1],\nch. 1, sect. 6.\n8\n\n\fThe su(3) algebra and the SU(3) group have no Gauss decomposition\nbecause are semisimple compact ( [1], ch. 3, sect. 6), but they represent\ncompact real forms of the algebra sl(3, C), respectively the group SL(3, C),\nwhich are semisimple complex, and have a Gauss decomposition. The representations of su(3) and SU(3) which appear in applications are completely\ndetermined by the representations of sl(3, C), respectively SL(3, C) by the\nunitary Weyl trick [23], XI, XII.\nThe Lie algebra sl(3, C), (A2 ), is the subalgebra of gl(3, C) generated\nby the traceless 3 \u00d7 3 matrices. A basis of sl(3, C) is represented by the\nmatrices Fk , k = 1, 8 introduced in the previous section, but this choice is\nnot appropriate for the Gauss decomposition. Instead, it is convenient to\nexpress the basis elements as linear combinations of the basis of the gl(3, C)\nalgebra. The Weyl basis of gl(3, C) is represented by nine 3 \u00d7 3 matrices\n{eik , i, k = 1, 3} which have a single non-vanishing element, equal to 1,\n(eik )\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4i\u03b1 \u03b4k\u03b2 .\n\n(21)\n\n[eik , ejl ] = \u03b4kj eil \u2212 \u03b4il ejk ,\n\n(22)\n\nTheir commutator\nis a matrix of sl(3, C), and therefore the same commutation relations will be\nsatisfied by the nine traceless matrices Aik = eik \u2212 \u03b4ik I/3,\n[Aik , Ajl ] = \u03b4kj Ail \u2212 \u03b4il Ajk .\n\n(23)\n\nFor applications in nuclear physics it is useful to remark that operators\neik which satisfy the commutation relations (22) can be constructed by using\nboson operators. Thus, if a\u2020i and ai , i = 1, 2, 3, denote the creation and\nannihilation boson operators, ([ai , a\u2020k ] = \u03b4ik , [ai , ak ] = [a\u2020i , a\u2020k ] = 0), which\nappear in the Hamiltonian of the isotropic harmonic oscillator,\nh0 = h\u0304\u03c9\n\n3\nX\n\n1\n(a\u2020i ai + ) ,\n2\ni=1\n\n(24)\n\nthen eik = a\u2020i ak satisfy Eq. (22), and [eik , h0 ] = 0.\nThe relationship between the two basis sets for sl(3, C), {Aik ; i, k = 1, 3\nand {Fk , k = 1, 8} takes a simple form in terms of the complex combinations\nI\u00b1 = F1 \u00b1 iF2 , K\u00b1 = F4 \u00b1 iF5 , L\u00b1 = F6 \u00b1 iF7 .\n9\n\n(25)\n\n\fBy using these new operators, the relationship between the two basis sets is\ngiven by the equations\n1\n1\n2\nA11 = \u221a F8 + F3 , A22 = \u221a F8 \u2212 F3 , A33 = \u2212 \u221a F8 ,\n3\n3\n3\n\n(26)\n\nA12 = I+ , A13 = K+ , A23 = L+ ,\nA21 = I\u2212 , A31 = K\u2212 , A32 = L\u2212 .\n\n(27)\n\nThe algebra sl(3, C) decomposes in the Cartan subalgebra H, which is\ngenerated by the elements F3 and F8 , and the subalgebras N \u00b1 , generated by\nI\u00b1 , K\u00b1 and L\u00b1 . By using the expansion\nF\u03c1 =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03a6k (\u03c1)ekk\n\n(28)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03c1 is 3 or 8, the sl(3, C) commutation relations in the Cartan-Weyl\nbasis are expressed by\n[F\u03c1 , Ajk ] = \u03b1jk (\u03c1)Ajk\n(29)\n[Aik , Ajl ] = \u03b4kj Ail \u2212 \u03b4il Ajk , i 6= k , j 6= l .\n\n(30)\n\nThe coefficients \u03b1jk are linear functions on H, defined by\n\u03b1jk (\u03c1) = \u03a6j (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03a6k (\u03c1) ,\n\n(31)\n\n\u2206 = {\u03b1jk ; j, k = 1, 2, 3}\n\n(32)\n\nand the set\nrepresents the root system.\nThe linear combinations of the roots generate the dual space of H, denoted H\u0303. If \u03b112 , \u03b113 and \u03b123 are chosen positive, then \u03b112 and \u03b123 are the\nsimple roots. The new structure constants\n(ik)\n\nC\u03c1(jl) = \u03b1jl (\u03c1)\u03b4ij \u03b4kl\n\n(33)\n\ngive the restriction of the metric tensor to the Cartan subalgebra\ng\u03c1\u03c3 = (F\u03c1 , F\u03c3 ) =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03b1jl (\u03c1)\u03b1jl (\u03c3) = 3\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n\nj,l=1\n\n10\n\n(34)\n\n\fwith \u03c1, \u03c3 = 3 or 8. Thus, the restriction of the Killing form to H is nondegenerate, and for every \u03b1 \u2208 H\u0303 exists an unique element h\u03b1 \u2208 H, denoted\nin the following also by \u03b1, such that \u2200h \u2208 H\n\u03b1(h) = (h\u03b1 , h) , (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2261 (h\u03b1 , h\u03b2 ) , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 H\u0303 .\n\n(35)\n\nReciprocally, this relationship associates linear functions to the elements of\nH. The linear functions \u03b13 and \u03b18 associated by Eq. (29) to F3 and F8 are\nidentically zero. However, Eq. (34) and (35) lead to a covariant orthogonal\nbasis \u011d\u03c3 , \u03c3 = 3 or 8, in H\u0303, defined by \u011d\u03c3 (\u03c1) = g\u03c3\u03c1 . The covariant coordinates\nof the roots from \u2206 in this basis are given by Eq. (35).\nAnother covariant\n\u221a basis in H\u0303 is represented by the simple roots. These\nhave the length 1/ 3 with respect to the Killing form, and span an angle of\n120 degrees. The matrices associated by Eq.

Fundamental representations\nThe irreducible representations of a Lie group G which admits a Gauss\ndecomposition of the form G = Z \u2212 DZ + , with Z \u00b1 , D, generated by N \u00b1 , H,\n11\n\n\frespectively, are induced by the one-dimensional representations (characters)\n\u03c4 (\u03b4), \u03b4 \u2208 D of the subgroup D. Let Rg , g \u2208 G, a representation of G on the\nfinite dimensional linear space V . The elements of V which are eigenstates of\nthe operators R\u03b4 , \u03b4 \u2208 D are called weight vectors. In particular, the weight\nvectors |M >,\nR\u03b4 |M >= \u03c4M (\u03b4)|M > , \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D\n(40)\nwhich remain invariant to the action of the subgroup Z + ,\nRz |M >= |M > , \u2200z \u2208 Z + ,\n\n(41)\n\nare called highest weight vectors.\nIn the linear irreps theory of the group GL(n, C) are proved the following\nimportant theorems:\nTh. I. Every carrier space V of a finite dimensional irrep R of GL(n, C)\ncontains an unique highest weight vector, cyclical for V .\nTh. II. The irrep induced by the character \u03c4M occurrs in the decomposition\nof an reducible representation on the space V with a multiplicity equal to\nthe number of the highest weight vectors |M > contained by V [23] ch. VI,\nsect. 3.1.\nTh. III. The analytical complex inductive characters for the representations\nof the group GL(3, C) have the expression\n\u03c4 (\u03b4) = \u03b31m1 \u03b32m2 \u03b33m3\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03b31 0 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n, \u03b4 = \uf8f0 0 \u03b32 0 \uf8fb \u2208 D ,\n0 0 \u03b33\n\n(42)\n\nwith m1 \u2265 m2 \u2265 m3 , integers [1] ch. 8 sect. 3.\nThe finite dimensional irreps of the group SU(3) can be realized on the\nirrep spaces of its complex extension, SL(3, C). The restriction of the characters \u03c4 of D \u2282 GL(3, C) to SUD(3) \u2282 D defines a character \u03c4 0 which specifies\ncompletely the irreps of SU(3). This restriction is obtained by considering\nonly matrices \u03b4 with elements \u03b3i , i = 1, 2, 3 such that\n|\u03b3i| = 1 , \u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b33 = 1 .\n\n(43)\n\nIf the simple roots are \u03b112 and \u03b123 , then every matrix d \u2208 SUD(3) can\nbe written as\nd = eih , h = t12 \u03b112 + t23 \u03b123 ,\n(44)\n12\n\n\fwhere the real parameters t12 and t23 are\nt12 = 2\n\n(h, \u03b123 )\n(h, \u03b112 )\n, t23 = 2\n.\n(\u03b112 , \u03b112 )\n(\u03b123 , \u03b123 )\n\n(45)\n\nReplacing \u03b112 and \u03b123 from Eq. (44) by the expressions of Eq. (36), (37),\nthe matrix elements of d take the form\ni 12\n\n\u03b31 = e 6 t\n\ni\n\n12 \u2212t23 )\n\n, \u03b32 = e\u2212 6 (t\n\ni 23\n\n, \u03b33 = e\u2212 6 t\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\nThese elements satisfy the conditions of Eq. (43), and therefore, by Th. III,\nthe inductive character can be written in the form\n0\n\u03c4M\n(d) = ei(M ,h) ,\n\n(47)\n\nwith M \u2208 H\u0303 defined by M = (m1 \u2212 m2 )\u03b112 + (m2 \u2212 m3 )\u03b123 . The element M\nof H\u0303 is called highest weight. Therefore, every irrep of SU(3) is completely\nspecified by two non-negative integers, P = m1 \u2212 m2 and Q = m2 \u2212 m3 ,\nand is denoted D(P, Q). The carrier space of this irrep will be denoted in\nthe following by V (P, Q). By using the same notation for the elements of\nthe su(3) algebra and the corresponding representation operators in V (P, Q),\nthe expansion of Eq. (40) and (41) for SU(3) near the identity leads to the\nequations\n\u03b112 |M >= (\u03b112 , \u03b112 )P |M > , \u03b123 |M >= (\u03b123 , \u03b123 )Q|M > ,\n\n(48)\n\nand, respectively\nI+ |M >= 0 , L+ |M >= 0 .\n\n(49)\n\nThus, according to Eq. (36), (37), |M > is an eigenvector of F3 and F8 , and\nby Eq.

The couple (i3 , y) of the eigenvalues labels the vectors |m >,\nand will be denoted in the first part of this work by m. These eigenvalues are\nrelated to the components m13 and m32 of the weight m in the contravariant\nbasis by\nm13 + m32\nm13 \u2212 m32\ni3 =\n, y=\n.\n(53)\n2\n3\nAccording to Th.

Mixed tensors can be obtained by\nthe direct product of the covariant and contravariant tensors. These spaces\ncarry SU(3) representations which are in general reducible. Therefore, of a\nparticular interest are those tensors, called irreducible, whose components\nare the basis elements in spaces of SU(3) irreducible representation.\nThe action of SU(3) defined by Eq. (70),(71) commutes with the action\nof the permutation group on the set of tensor indices. Therefore, irreducible\nare only the tensors which, as functions of indices, provide an irreducible\nrepresentation of the permutation group. Such tensors are obtained by linear\ncombinations of the type - I and II tensors. The resulting tensor should be\neither symmetric, or antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of welldefined subsets of indices.\nObjects with the transformation properties of the tensors I and II are\nrepresented by the set of basis elements in the spaces obtained by the multiple\ndirect product of the spaces V (3) and V (3\u2217 ), respectively. The spaces\nV (P ) = V 1 (3) \u2297 ... \u2297 V P (3) , V (Q) = V 1 (3\u2217 ) \u2297 ... \u2297 V P (3\u2217 ) ,\n\n(72)\n\nhave as basis elements\n(1)\n\n(P )\n\n(a) Ti1 ...iP = xi1 ...xiP , (b) T j1 ...jQ = y (1)j1 ...x(Q)jQ .\n\n(73)\n\nThe generators of the infinitesimal transformations in V (P ) have the form\n(1)\n\n(P )\n\nFk = Fk \u2297 I (2) \u2297 ... \u2297 I (P ) + ...I (1) \u2297 I (2) \u2297 ... \u2297 Fk\n(i)\n\n,\n\n(74)\n\nwhere Fk , k = 1, 8, and I (i) denote the su(3) generator, and, respectively,\nthe unit operator, in the space V i (3). Similarly is defined the action on V (P )\n17\n\n\fof the su(3) operators {Aik , i, k = 1, 2, 3}.\n(k)\nThe direct product of the highest weight vectors x1 , k = 1, ..., P give\nthe element of the tensor T \u2297P\n(1)\n\n(P )\n\n\u2297P\nT11...1\n= |M >= x1 ...x1\n\n,\n\n(75)\n\nwhich is a highest weight vector in V (P ), with (i3 , y)M = (P/2, P/3).

Therefore, their\n\u2297P\naction on the highest weight component T11...1\ngenerates the components of\na symmetric, irreducible, covariant tensor. The symmetry with respect to\nthe permutation of the lower indices allows to replace the Kronecker product\n(k)\nof Eq. (73) by the Young product. In the Young product, the vectors xi\n(j)\nand xi , from V k (3) and V j (3), with k 6= j, are supposed to be the same,\nand are both denoted by xi . This procedure leads to a mapping T \u2297P \u2192 T P ,\nwhere T P is a polynomial of degree P in three variables having the same\ntransformation properties under SU(3) as the basis elements of V (3),\nTiP1 ...iP = xi1 ...xiP = (x1 )p1 (x2 )p2 (x3 )p3 ,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere p1 , p2 , p3 are non-negative integers such that\np1 + p2 + p3 = P .\n\n(77)\n\nThe components of T P are eigenvectors of the operators F3 and F8 , and\ngenerate an orthogonal basis in V (P, 0).

X sect. 13.4, [1] ch. 8 sect. 8.\nThe weight diagram of V (P, Q) is obtained by substracting from the highest weight (i3 , y)M = ((P +Q)/2, (P \u2212Q)/3) linear combinations with integer\ncoefficients of the simple roots \u03b112 , \u03b113 , and \u03b132 . This diagram has three\nsymmetry axes, and is bounded by the polygonal line drawn in Fig. 2.

The main difficulty which appears with respect to the case of the\ngroup SU(2) is due to the fact that in general, for certain representations\nD(Pk , Qk ), mk can be greater than 1.\nThe basis of the direct product space has the form of a mixed tensor,\nwithout permutation symmetry. The linear combinations of the components\nof this tensor obtained by contraction and antisymmetrization generate subspaces which are SU(3) invariant. Therefore, the basis of the irrep spaces is\ngenerated by those mixed tensors which are symmetric at the permutation\nof the upper and lower indices, and traceless with respect to any contraction.\nThe tensors which give the decomposition of the direct product can be constructed explicitly below, for each particular case.\n(A).

The action of the operators Aik\non the boundary lines of the diagram of Fig. 3 cannot lead to weights outside\nthe diagram, and therefore, the values of \u03c7 and \u03ba on the boundary will be\nused to initiate the recurrence formulas. Denoting by (\u2206, \u03c4 ) and (\u03a9, \u03b8) the\ncoordinates (i, y) of the points placed on the line d, respectively \u03bd, the initial\nconditions are\n\u03c7\u2206\u03c4 = 0 , \u03ba\u03a9\u03b8 = 0 .\n(163)\nThese conditions indicate the fact that \u03c6iy and \u03c8iy vanish on d, respectively\n\u03bd, while Eq.

Therefore, to calculate \u03c7 and \u03ba at any point of the diagram\nof Fig. 3 it is enough to know the values of z on u or \u03bd, and of w on d or \u03b4.\nWhen the expressions of \u03c7 and \u03ba given by Eq.

In the following the action of the generators K\u00b1 and L\u00b1 will\nbe expressed by using the notation of ref.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients\nThe Clebsch-Gordan series and the explicit form of the basis tensors in the\nirrep spaces appearing in the decomposition of the direct product V (P1 , Q1 )\u2297\nV (P2 , Q2 ) have been presented in sect. VI. The expressions obtained for\nthese tensors become cumbersome when the dimension of the factor spaces\nincreases, and therefore, the tensor representation is useful only in simple\ncases. However, the canonical basis of the spaces V \u03b3 (Pk , Qk ) in Eq. (104) can\nbe constructed by using the theorems I-III presented in sect. IV. According\nto these theorems, the basis can be constructed by following a three-step\nprocedure:\n1. Find the subspaces W (Pk , Qk ) generated by the vectors given in Eq. (122)\nwhich satisfy Eq. (48),(49), namely\nI+ |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 = 0 ,\n\n(180)\n\nK+ |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 = 0 , L+ |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 = 0 ,\n\n(181)\n\nand\nI3 |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 = i|Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3\n\n,\n\nY |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 = y|Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3\n\n,\n\n(182)\n\nwhere \u03b3 takes values from 1 to mk = dim W (Pk , Qk ), i = Pk /2, y = (Pk +\n2Qk )/3, and\n(1)i\n\nAik = Ak\n\n(2)i\n\n\u2297 I (2) + I (1) \u2297 Ak\n\n, i, k = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(183)\n\n2. Chose an orthonormal basis in each space W (Pk , Qk ), such that\n\u03b3\n\n< Pk Qk i i y|Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 = 1, mk .\n\n(184)\n\n3. Generate the basis of the subspaces V \u03b3 (Pk , Qk ) by applying the operators\nI\u2212 , K\u2212 , L\u2212 on the highest weight vectors |Pk Qk i i y >\u03b3 .\nIf the tensor product is simply reducible, ( mk is 0 or 1), the decomposition\nis obtained simply by the transition to a basis of V (P1 , Q1 ) \u2297 V (P2 , Q2 ) in\nwhich the Casimir operators constructed with the generators of Eq. (183)\nare diagonal. Because F and G are Hermitian, the subspaces corresponding\nto different eigenvalues f , g, and implicitly with different indices (P, Q), are\n36\n\n\forthogonal and irreducible. The matrix of the linear transformation from the\neigenvectors of the set of operators\n(a) : {F1 , F2 , G1 , G2 , I 2 , I12 , I22 , I3 , Y1 , Y2 }\nto the eigenvectors of the set\n(b) : {F, G, F1 , F2 , G1 , G2 , I 2 , I3 , Y }\nis the matrix of the isoscalar factors, and it can be obtained by finding the\ncommon eigenvectors of the set (b).\nThe multiplicities appear when the space obtained by the direct product\nhas a symmetry higher than SU(3). This means that it exists a Hermitian\noperator X which commutes with all the operators of the set (b), and is\nindependent of them, which should be added to obtain the complete set of\ncompatible observables. The expression given by Moshinsky for this operator\nis\n3\n1 X\n(1)i (1)j (2)k\n(1)i (1)k (2)j\nX=\n(Ak Ai Aj + Ak Aj Ai ) .\n(185)\n2 i,j,k=1\nThe subspaces generated by the eigenvectors of the set (b) of operators can\nbe further decomposed by diagonalizing the operator X. This method is\ncumbersome, and in practice it is not used, but is equivalent to the threestep procedure presented above. Thus, every vector satisfying the system\nof Eq. (180)-(182), is also an eigenvector of the operators F and G. This\nfollows by using the commutation relations of Eq. (23) to rearrange the\noperators appearing in Eq. (54) such that I+ , K+ and L+ are placed to the\nright of I\u2212 , K\u2212 , L\u2212 . When the resulting expression is applied on the vectors\nwhich satisfy the Eq. (180)-(182), the only non-vanishing terms will be those\ndependent only on I3 and Y , which lead to multiplication by a constant.\nBecause F and G are Hermitian, the solutions of Eq. (180)-(182), denoted\nby |s >, which correspond to different sets (P, Q), will be orthogonal. The\nremaining eigenvectors are generated in the step 3. They will be eigenvectors\nof F and G with the same values as |s >, because F and G commute with\nall Aik . This shows that the solutions |s > corresponding to different values\nP and Q are highest weight vectors in orthogonal irreducible subspaces.\nWhen there are multiplicities, there are several independent solutions,\n{|s >\u03b3 ; \u03b3 = 1, dim(Ws )}, with the same indices (P, Q). In this case, one of\n37\n\n\fthe vectors |s > is arbitrarily chosen, and then the other can be obtained\nby the Gram-Schmidt procedure, such that are orthonormal. This leads to a\ndecomposition of the product space in a direct sum of irreducible orthogonal\nsubspaces, and to an unitary matrix of isoscalar factors. The vectors of the\ncanonical basis in these subspaces are linear combinations of the form of Eq.\n(126)\n|sii3 y >=\n\nX\n\niyss1 s2 j\n\u03b1\u03bcjk\nCm\n\n\u03bc,m,j,k\n\nk i\ni3 \u2212m i3 |s1 jm\u03bc\n\n> |s2 k i3 \u2212 m y \u2212 \u03bc > .\n\n(186)\n\nFor given values of s1 and s2 , s in Eq. (186) can take all the values\nappearing in the Clebsch-Gordan series. Fixing a certain value of s means to\nspecify the allowed intervals for the variation of i and y. These intervals have\nbeen determined in sect. VII, and the result is presented in the diagram of\nFig. 3.\nThe possible values of the summation indices {j, \u03bc} and {k, y \u2212 \u03bc} can\nbe represented in similar diagrams, denoted A and B, corresponding to the\ncarrier spaces of the irreps s1 , respectively s2 . In the orthogonal frame of axes\n(k, \u03bc, j), the possible values of these indices are represented by the points \u03c0\nfor which the projection in the plane (j, \u03bc) is a node of the lattice A, and in\nthe plane (k, \u03bc) a node of the lattice B. This condition is expressed by the\ninequalities\nP1 + 2Q1\n2P1 + Q1\n\u2264\u03bc\u2264\n(187)\n\u2212\n3\n3\n2P2 + Q2\nP2 + 2Q2\n\u2212\n\u2264y\u2212\u03bc\u2264\n,\n(188)\n3\n3\nor, in compact form,\nmax(\u2212\n\n2P1 + Q1\nP2 + 2Q2\n,y \u2212\n)\n3\n3\n\n(189)\n\n2P2 + Q2\nP1 + 2Q1\n,y +\n) .\n3\n3\nHowever, not all the points (k, \u03bc, j) which satisfy this inequality appear as\nsummation indices in Eq. (186), but only those for which\n\u2264 \u03bc \u2264 min(\n\nk + j \u2265 i , |k \u2212 j| \u2264 i .\n38\n\n(190)\n\n\fGeometrically, this means that not all the points selected by Eq. (189),\nrepresented by the 3D lattice of Fig. 6, appear as indices of the isoscalar\nfactors, but only those which satisfy also Eq. (190). This condition selects\nthe points which are inside and on the border of the space bounded by three\nplanes which are parallel to the \u03bc-axis, and cross the k and j axes at the\npoints with coordinates (k, j) = (i, 0), (0, i), and (0, \u2212i) (Fig. 7). The final\nlattice obtained by this selection procedure is complicated in general, and it\nchanges at the variation of i and y.\nWith these considerations, we can proceed by following the three-step\nprocedure presented at the beginning of this section.\n1.

(194) and (195), with the constraints of\nEq. (196), (197). Let \u03bcmin and \u03bcmax be the effective extreme values of \u03bc,\ndifferent in general from the limits appearing in Eq. (196). One can see that\nthe recurrence relationships determine completely the factors \u03b1 only in two\ncases:\nI. The lattice of Fig. 6 attached to the highest weight (i, y) is bounded at\n\u03bcmin by a segment parallel to the axis k, and at \u03bcmax by an arbitrary figure.\nII. The lattice of Fig. 6 is bounded at \u03bcmin by an arbitrary figure, and at\n\u03bcmax by a segment parallel to the axis j. In any other case the multiplicity\nwill be greater than 1, equal to the minimum number of factors \u03b1 required\nto initiate the recurrence relationships.\nAs an example, in Fig. 6 is represented the diagram associated to the\nhighest weight in the case P = P1 = P2 , Q = Q1 = Q2 . It is easy to see that\nthe multiplicity of the representation D(P, Q) in the decomposition of the\ndirect product is equal to the number of nodes of the lattice A placed on the\nj - axis. If (P \u2212 Q)/3 is an integer, this number represents the multiplicity\nof the weight i3 = 0, y = 0 from the space V (P, Q), which is 1 + min(P, Q).\nBy this, one recovers the result stated in ref. [28].\n2. The highest weight vector |s >\u2261 |P Q i i y > given by Eq. (194) - (197)\ndepends in general on free parameters which cannot be specified by the SU(3)\nsymmetry alone. In principle, it is possible to chose these parameters such\nthat to specify an orthonormal basis in W (P, Q). However, the result has\na physical meaning only if there is a Hermitian operator associated to an\nobservable, commuting with all the operators of the set (b), which has a\ndiagonal matrix in this orthonormal basis.\n3. Every point of the lattice of Fig. 3 is associated by Eq. (186) to a row in\ns\nthe matrix of the isoscalar factors. The calculation of the factors \u03b1\u03bcjk\nalong\niys\nthe row (i, y) was presented at step 1. The factors \u03b1\u03bcjk from other rows can\ns\nbe related to \u03b1\u03bcjk\nby an additional set of recurrence formulas.\n41\n\n\fActing by L\u2212 on both sides of Eq.

(244), and have the values\n\u221a\n\u221a\n6\n2\n1\n1\n00(00)\n00(00)\n00(00)\n00(00)\n, \u03b1\u22121 1 1 = \u2212 , \u03b1000 = \u2212\n, \u03b11 1 1 =\n. (261)\n\u03b1011 =\n22\n22\n4\n2\n4\n2\nThe same result can be obtained by using the recurrence formulas.\nConcluding remarks\nThe expressions of the isoscalar factors given in Eq. (215) and (237), derived here by using Eq. (202), are the same as in ref. [22]. Also, the isoscalar\nfactors determined in sect. XIV have the values given in the tables [9].\nThe symmetry properties of the SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can\nbe found by using the symmetry properties of the recurrence relationships for\nthe isoscalar factors. However, it is easier to derive them from the integral\nrepresentation of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, given by the projection operators associated to the matrix elements of the irreducible representations\n54\n\n\f[9], [28], [34], [35].\nIn general, for the group SU(n), n > 2, the canonical factorization\nSU(n) \u2283 U(1) \u00d7 SU(n \u2212 1) can only solve the problem of the multiplicity for\nthe weights, but not for the representations appearing in the Clebsch-Gordan\nseries. Therefore, whatever method is used for reduction, it is not possible\nto obtain numerical values for all the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, without\nmaking additional assumptions. Biedenharn and Louck [36] have shown that\nby using the general property of canonical embedding for U(n),\nU(n2 ) \u2283 U(n) \u00d7 U(n) \u2283 U(n)\n\n(262)\n\nit is possible to solve the problem of the multiplicities such that all ClebschGordan coefficients are determined.\nThe recurrence equations for the SU(n) isoscalar factors obtained by using the canonical factorization can be derived by acting on the weight vectors\nwith the representation operators for the sl(n, C) generators associated to the\nn \u2212 1 simple roots. The action of the sl(n, C) operators associated to the\nremaining positive roots leads to an additional set of\n(n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2)\nn(n \u2212 1)\n\u2212 (n \u2212 1) =\n2\n2\n\n(263)\n\nequations, which are identically satisfied due to the properties of the SU(n \u2212\n1) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Therefore, these relationships may provide in\ngeneral only the dependence of the isoscalar factors on arbitrary parameters,\nbecause for n > 3, SU(n \u2212 1) is not simply reducible. In the treatment of\na specific quantum system, the use of a complete set of compatible observables might eliminate the ambiguities, leading to well-defined values of these\nparameters in each physical situation.\nAcknowledgements.
