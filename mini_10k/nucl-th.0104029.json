INTRODUCTION\n\nThe modification of the free space properties of a vector meson in hadronic or nuclear\nmatter is an important problem which has attracted much attention. Among the properties\nof immediate interest are the mass shift and width broadening of the particle in a medium.\nMany authors have studied these questions for the \u03c1 meson, and also in some cases the \u03c9\nmeson, at zero temperature in equilibrium nuclear matter, see the reviews of Ref. [1] and\nRefs. [2\u20136]. More closely related to this paper is the finite temperature work of Rapp et al.\n[7,8] who have considered the medium modification of the pions comprising the meson, as\nwell as additional medium scattering contributions. There have also been studies [9,10] of \u03c9\nand \u03c1 mesons in a pion heat bath, although we shall see that nucleons produce a larger effect.\nQCD sum rules have also been employed [1,3], but these are tailored to the small distance\nbehavior whereas, as Eletsky and Ioffe [2] have pointed out, the self-energy is determined\nby meson-nucleon scattering at relatively large distances of order 1 fm; see also Ref. [11].\nMany of these works have relied on effective Lagrangians; however, we would like to\nadopt as model-independent an approach as possible. Therefore we use experimental data\nto construct the amplitude for vector mesons scattering from pions and nucleons. The low\nenergy region is described in terms of resonances plus background, while at high energies\na Regge model is employed. In principle the amplitude should be completely determined\nby the data. In practice there are uncertainties because the data are often inaccurate and\nincomplete, particularly for the \u03c9 meson. It is therefore important to check that the real\nand imaginary parts of our amplitudes approximately satisfy the dispersion relation which\nfollows from the analytic properties of the amplitude. Using our amplitude the in-medium\nself-energy of the \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons can be calculated at finite temperature and density. We use\nthe leading term of the exact self-energy expansion [12] which requires that the densities be\nsufficiently small that only single scatterings are important. Where possible we will compare\nwith results from the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model [13]\nwhich has been extensively tested. For the \u03c1 meson this paper represents an updated and\nimproved version of earlier work [14] hereinafter referred to as EIK.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the formalism, parameters and\nresults for the scattering amplitudes. These are employed in Sec. III where the self-energies\nof the \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons are presented. Concluding remarks are given in Sec. IV.\nII. SCATTERING AMPLITUDES\nA. Low Energy Amplitude\n\nWe assume that the self-energies of the isovector \u03c1 and isoscalar \u03c9 vector mesons are\ndominated by scattering from the pions and nucleons present in a heat bath. Accordingly\nwe need four scattering amplitudes. We will adopt the two-component duality approach due\nto Harari [15] (see also Collins [16]) which states that while ordinary Reggeons are dual to\n1\n\n\fs-channel resonances, the Pomeron is dual to the background upon which the resonances\nare superimposed. Taking for definiteness the case of a \u03c1 meson scattering from particle a,\nwe write the forward scattering amplitude in the c.m. system as\ncm\nf\u03c1a\n(s)\n\nqcm rP\u03c1a (1 + exp\u2212i\u03c0\u03b1P ) \u03b1P\n\u0393R\u2192\u03c1a\n1 X R\n\u221a\n\u2212\ns .\nW\n=\n2qcm R \u03c1a MR \u2212 s \u2212 12 i\u0393R\n4\u03c0s\nsin \u03c0\u03b1P\n\n(1)\n\nHere the first term involves a sum over a series of Breit-Wigner resonances of mass MR\nand total width \u0393R , while the second term is the Pomeron background contribution which\nis discussed in Sec. II B below. No background contribution was included in EIK [14].\nFor the\u221aBreit-Wigner term we have used the non-relativistic form which amounts to setting\nMR + s \u2243 2MR in the relativistic denominator MR2 \u2212\n\u221as \u2212 i\u0393R MR . This has a negligible\neffect on the results we present. In the usual notation s is the total c.m. energy and the\nmagnitude of the c.m. momentum is\nqcm =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u221a\n[s \u2212 (m\u03c1 + ma )2 ][s \u2212 (m\u03c1 \u2212 ma )2 ]/ s .\n\nq\n\n(2)\n\nThe statistical averaging factor for spin and isospin is\nR\nW\u03c1a\n=\n\n(2tR + 1)\n(2sR + 1)\n,\n(2s\u03c1 + 1)(2sa + 1) (2t\u03c1 + 1)(2ta + 1)\n\n(3)\n\nin an obvious notation. Since we are averaging over all spin directions we shall not distinguish\nlongitudinal and transverse polarizations. The isospin averaging implies that all charge states\nof particle a are equally populated so there is no medium-induced mixing [17] between the \u03c1\nand \u03c9 mesons. In eq. (1) \u0393R\u2192\u03c1a represents the partial width for the resonance decay into the\nR\nR\n\u03c1a channel. If we denote the c.m. momentum at resonance by qcm\n, then for qcm \u2265 qcm\nwe use\nthe value obtained from the total width and the branching ratio on resonance. However the\nR\nthreshold behavior of the partial width is known and we incorporate this for qcm \u2264 qcm\nby\nR 2l+1\nreplacing \u0393R\u2192\u03c1a by \u0393R\u2192\u03c1a (qcm /qcm )\n, where l is the relative angular momentum between\nthe \u03c1 and the a. Since the total width is the sum of the partial widths this dependence\nshould be incorporated in \u0393R . We do this in the case that a is a pion, but when a is a\nnucleon there are many decay channels and it becomes impractical, so we simply take \u0393R to\nbe a constant.\nFor the case of \u03c1N scattering we use the N \u2217 and \u2206\u2217 resonances from Manley and Saleski\n[18] which are listed in Table I. These provide a better match onto the high energy region\nthan the fit of Vrana et al. [19]. It is also necessary to include the \u2206(1232) and the N(1520)\nsubthreshold resonances since they make a substantial contribution. In order to estimate\nthe widths we assume that the vector dominance model is valid, even though it is better\nsuited to high energies. This allows us to relate the photon and \u03c1 widths. Specifically, since\nboth resonances are close to the \u03c1N threshold, we can write for each of them \u0393\u03c1N = qcm \u03b3\u03c1N\nand \u0393\u03b3N = kcm \u03b3\u03b3N , where kcm is \u03b3N c.m. momentum. Then vector dominance gives\n2\n\n\f\u03b3\u03b3N\n\ng\u03c12\n1\n= 4\u03c0\u03b1 2 1 + 2 \u03b3\u03c1N ,\ng\u03c1\ng\u03c9\n!\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fine structure constant. For the coupling to the photon we take g\u03c12/4\u03c0 = 2.54\nand g\u03c12 /g\u03c92 = 1/8. The value of \u03b3\u03b3N can be deduced from the decay width and the photon\nbranching ratio of the resonances [20].\nFor the case of \u03c9N much less information is available, although better data is expected\nin the future [21]. Therefore we adopt two extreme models with the expectation that reality\nlies somewhere between the two. The first we refer to as the two resonance model since, in\naddition to the subthreshold N(1520), we include the two resonances reported by Manley\nand Saleski [18]. These are the N(1900) [\u0393R = 498 MeV, branching ratio to \u03c9N 0.30]\nand the N(2190) [\u0393R = 547 MeV, branching ratio 0.49]. It must be stressed that there is\nuncertainty in these assignments; for example, Vrana et al. [19] report \u03c9N strength only\nfor the N(2190) with a roughly similar width and branching ratio. For the second model,\nmotivated by the fact that the \u03c1 and \u03c9 differ only in isospin, we use for the \u03c9 the same\nT = 21 N \u2217 resonances as for the \u03c1 with the same partial widths, except that we omit the\nN(1720) since it decays 75\u201380% in the \u03c1N channel [20]. In the other cases the errors are\nsufficiently large that similar \u03c1 and \u03c9 decays could be accomodated. We refer to this as\nthe multi-resonance model. We also examined the alternative procedure of adopting the\ndecay widths in the \u03c9N channel for the resonances found in the quark model calculations\nof Capstick and Roberts [22]. We found, however, that the cross section was too small for\nsatisfactory matching onto the high energy part.\nTurning now to the \u03c1\u03c0 amplitude, Eq. (1) indicates that a Breit-Wigner contribution\nfor s-waves in the limit qcm \u2192 0 is a constant since a factor of qcm is included in the partial\nwidth. According to Adler's theorem the pion scattering amplitude on any hadronic target\nvanishes when qcm \u2192 0 in the limit of massless pions. In the framework of an effective\nLagrangian this can be achieved if a derivative coupling is used for the pion field, \u2202\u03bc \u03c0.\nWe assume that the term in the Lagrangian responsible for \u03c1\u03c0 \u2192 a1 (1260) involves \u2202\u03bc \u03c0\nmultiplied by the \u03c1-meson field strength tensor \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd and a\u03bd for the a1 field. This gives an\nadditional factor which should be included for an s-wave partial width of\ns \u2212 m2\u03c1 \u2212 m2\u03c0\ns0 \u2212 m2\u03c1 \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nfor s \u2264 s0 , where s0 is a normalization point. When s \u2265 s0 this factor is replaced by unity.\nSince this is a soft pion effect it is reasonable to cut it off when qcm \u223c 1 \u22122m\u03c0 , hence we take\nthe normalization point to be s0 = (m\u03c1 + 2m\u03c0 )2 . We believe this is more reasonable than\n\u221a\ntaking the resonance mass for s0 as in EIK [14]. The analogous factor is also introduced\nfor the h1 (1170) resonance. The parameters [20] for these and the other meson resonances\nincluded in the calculation are listed in Table I. For the \u03c9\u03c0 amplitude only the b1 (1235) is\nlisted as having appreciable strength [20]. We take it to decay 100% to \u03c9\u03c0 with a width of\n142 MeV and apply the Adler factor as outlined above.\n3\n\n\fB. High Energy Amplitude\n\nThe high energy forward scattering amplitude is known [23] to be well approximated by\nthe Regge form\ncm\nf\u03c1a\n(s) = \u2212\n\nqcm X 1 + exp\u2212i\u03c0\u03b1i \u03c1a \u03b1i\nri s .\n4\u03c0s i\nsin \u03c0\u03b1i\n\n(6)\n\nWe shall consider a Pomeron term P and a Regge term P \u2032. In order to obtain the intercept \u03b1i\nand the residue ri for the i'th Regge pole trajectory we use the relation between the amplitude\ncm\nand the total cross section given by the optical theorem: \u03c3\u03c1a = 4\u03c0Imf\u03c1a\n/qcm . High energy\nscattering is dominated by contributions from individual quarks \u2013 the additive quark model.\nTherefore it is reasonable to average over charge states and take the cross section \u03c3\u03c1N \u2243 \u03c3\u03c0N .\nUsing the Particle Data Group listing [20] this gives intercepts \u03b1P = 1.093 and \u03b1P \u2032 = 0.642\nwith rP\u03c1N = 11.88 and rP\u03c1N\u2032 = 28.59 (the units yield a cross section in mb with energies in\nGeV). We would like to take \u03c3\u03c1\u03c0 \u2243 \u03c3\u03c0\u03c0 , averaged over charge states. Of course data for\nthe latter are not available, but for Regge exchange in the t-channel it is appropriate to\ninvoke factorization [24] so that the residue rP\u03c1\u03c0 \u2243 rP\u03c0\u03c0 \u2243 (rP\u03c0N )2 /rPN N = 7.508, using Ref.\n[20]. Similarly rP\u03c1\u03c0\u2032 = 12.74. The intercepts \u03b1i are universal. These parameters yield cross\nsections which are roughly 30% smaller than in EIK [14] where the \u03b3N and \u03b3\u03c0 cross sections\nwere employed along with vector dominance. This, together with the background term in\nEq. (1), allows us to satisfy the dispersion relation (see below) significantly more accurately\nthan with the EIK parameterization [14].\nSince the different isospin structure of the \u03c1 and the \u03c9 is expected to be insignificant at\nhigh energy, we adopt the same parameterization for the \u03c9\u03c0 and \u03c9N scattering amplitudes\nas for the \u03c1\u03c0 and \u03c1N amplitudes. The parameters for the Pomeron obtained here are also\nused for the background term in Eq. (1). Note that if the Pomeron intercept \u03b1P were\nexactly 1, the Pomeron amplitude would be pure imaginary.\nC. Results\n\nSince we shall work in the rest frame of the heat bath we will give the scattering amplitude\nfor the case that particle a is at rest. This is related to the c.m. amplitude by\n\u221a\ns cm\nf\u03c1a (E\u03c1 ) =\nf (s) ,\n(7)\nma \u03c1a\nwhere\nE\u03c1 \u2212 m\u03c1 =\n\ns \u2212 (m\u03c1 + ma )2\n.\n2ma\n\n(8)\n\nThe imaginary parts of f\u03c1a and f\u03c9a are shown in Fig. 1. In most cases the low energy\npart contains a number of overlapping resonances so that the structure is washed out. The\n4\n\n\fexception is the case of the \u03c9\u03c0 amplitude where the single b1 resonance is clearly visible (note\nthat this amplitude is the same in the middle and lower panels). Because of the kinematics,\nEq. (8), the resonance region ends at E\u03c1 \u2212 m\u03c1 \u223c 1 GeV for \u03c1N and \u223c 4 GeV for \u03c1\u03c0 and it is\nmatched onto the Regge part slightly beyond these points. At low energies the \u03c1N amplitude\nis of similar magnitude to the \u03c9N amplitude in the multi-resonance model, but it is much\nsmaller in the two-resonance model. This is less marked for the real part of the amplitude,\ngiven in Fig. 2, where the two \u03c9N amplitudes are more similar and both are smaller in\nmagnitude than the \u03c1N amplitude in this resonance region. The pion scattering amplitudes\ndisplay the change in sign expected for Breit-Wigner resonances. This is not seen in the\nnucleon case because of the subthreshold resonances included here. These are neglected by\nKondratyuk et al. [4] which may be the reason that their \u03c1N amplitude becomes slightly\npositive at small momenta; it is also somewhat larger in magnitude at large momenta. They\nobtained their result from a dispersion integral over an imaginary amplitude constructed\nfrom resonances at low energy and vector dominance together with photon cross sections at\nhigh energy.\nThe scattering amplitude should obey a once-subtracted dispersion relation relating the\nreal part to a principal value integral over the imaginary part:\n\u221e\n\nZ\n2E\u03c12\nImf\u03c1a (E \u2032 )dE \u2032\nP.V.\n.\nRef\u03c1a (E\u03c1 ) = Ref\u03c1a (0) +\n\u2032 (E \u20322 \u2212 E 2 )\n\u03c0\nE\n\u03c1\nm\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c1\n\nThus one can compare the analytical real part of Secs. II A and B with the result from\nEq. (9); the difference should be the constant Ref\u03c1a (0). This does not hold if one uses the\nRegge form for f at all energies, the difference only becomes exactly constant if the lower\nlimit of the integration is arbitarily taken to be the point where s = 0 [16]. Alternatively,\nif one assumes a pure resonance form for the amplitude the aforementioned difference is\nnot constant either. In both cases noticeable deviations from constancy start to appear at\nenergies E\u03c1 \u2212 m\u03c1 below about 2 GeV. This trend is also seen for the differences when the\nactual amplitudes are used, as displayed in Fig. 3. The nucleon amplitudes give the most\nreasonable account of the dispersion relation, with the \u03c9N two-resonance case showing a\nlarger deviation from constancy than the other two cases. For pion scattering the deviations\nare larger, although it should be borne in mind that the amplitudes themselves are larger\ntoo. Of course one would not expect phenomenological approximations to precisely obey\nthe stringent constraints which follow from the analytic properties of the amplitude, and in\nthat light we view the results in Fig. 3 as reasonable. We remark that we have considered\nvariations in the parameters involved in the amplitude and have not obtained improvement.\nIn particular, omission of the background Pomeron term in Eq. (1) gives much worse results.\nThere are inevitable uncertainties in a phenomenological parameterization of a scattering amplitude so it is useful to compare with other work. Here we contrast total cross\nsections calculated from the imaginary parts of the amplitudes discussed above with those\nused in the UrQMD model [13]. The latter employs a resonance description at the lower\n5\n\n\fenergies without, however, a background term. At the higher energies the CERN\u2013HERA\nparameterizations [20] are used, together with the additive quark model, leading to color\nstring excitations. Comparison of the cross sections for scattering from pions in Fig. 4\nshows quite close agreement except at the lowest energies. Here the UrQMD cross sections\nR 2l+1\n)\nis included in the width, nor is the Adler factor\nincrease because no factor of (qcm /qcm\nincluded. Since physically the cross section should go to zero in the chiral limit of massless pions we\n\u221a prefer our result where the cross sections are small. Note that precisely at\nthreshold, s = m\u03c1 + m\u03c0 , both approaches give a divergent cross section which, however,\nis of no consequence for the calculation of the self energies. The corresponding results for\nthe nucleon cross sections are given in Fig. 5. Again there is very close agreement at high\nenergies, but less good agreement at low energies. For the \u03c1 the basic difference is that\nUrQMD joins the string region to the resonance region at a lower energy. In fact our cross\nsection compares better with that of Kondratyuk et al. [4]. For the \u03c9 cross section only the\nN(1900) resonance is included in the UrQMD model, whereas we also include the N(2190).\nThis can be seen rather clearly in the lower panel for the two-resonance model. Naturally\nour multi-resonance model for the \u03c9 bears little resemblance to UrQMD (middle panel) at\nlow energies, being closer to the \u03c1N case. Apart from this we would say that there is broad\nagreement between UrQMD and the present results.\nIII. SELF-ENERGIES OF THE VECTOR MESONS\n\nFor a \u03c1 meson scattering from hadron a in the medium the contribution to the retarded\nself-energy [12,14] is:\n\u221a\nZ\ns cm\nd3 k\nn\n(\u03c9)\nf (s) ,\n(10)\n\u03a0\u03c1a (E, p) = \u22124\u03c0\na\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u03c9 \u03c1a\nwhere E and p are the energy and momentum of the \u03c1 meson, \u03c9 2 = m2a + k 2 , and na is\neither a Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac occupation number as appropriate for particle a. If\nthe self-energy is evaluated on shell in the rest frame of a it is possible to do all the angular\nintegrations, giving\nZ\u221e\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nm\u03c1 \u03c9\nm\u03c1 ma T\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c9+ /T )\nf\u03c1a\n\u03a0\u03c1a (p) = \u2212\nd\u03c9 ln\n\u03c0p m\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c9\u2212 /T )\nma\na\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u00b1 = (E\u03c9 \u00b1 pk)/m\u03c1 and a is a boson. If a is a fermion \u03c9\u00b1 has an additional chemical\npotential contribution \u2212\u03bc and the argument of the logarithm becomes [1+exp(\u2212\u03c9\u2212 /T )]/[1+\nexp(\u2212\u03c9+ /T )].\nThe total self-energy is given by summing over all target species and including the vacuum\ncontribution\nvac\n\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (E, p) = \u03a0\u03c1 (M) + \u03a0\u03c1\u03c0 (p) + \u03a0\u03c1N (p) .\n\n6\n\n(12)\n\n\f\u221a\nHere the vacuum part of \u03a0 can only depend on the invariant mass, M = E 2 \u2212 p2 , whereas\nthe matter parts can in principle depend on E and p separately. However, in the approximation we are using the scattering amplitudes are of necessity evaluated on the mass shell of\nthe \u03c1 meson. This means that the matter parts only depend on p because M is fixed at m\u03c1 .\nThe dispersion relation is determined from the poles of the propagator with the self-energy\nevaluated on shell, i.e. M = m\u03c1 . Taking again for definiteness the case of the \u03c1 we have\nE 2 = m2\u03c1 + p2 + \u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (p) .\n\n(13)\n\nSince the self-energy has real and imaginary parts so does E(p) = ER (p) \u2212 i\u0393(p)/2. The\nwidth is given by\n\u0393(p) = \u2212Im\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (p)/ER (p) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwith\n2ER2 (p) = p2 + m2\u03c1 + Re\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (p) +\n\nq\n\n2\ntot\n2\n[p2 + m2\u03c1 + Re\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (p)] + [Im\u03a0\u03c1 (p)] .\n\n(15)\n\nThe width of the \u03c1-meson in vacuum, \u0393vac\n= \u2212Im\u03a0vac\n\u03c1\n\u03c1 /m\u03c1 , is 150 MeV (the width of the\n\u03c9-meson in vacuum is 8.4 MeV). We define the mass shift to be\n\u2206m\u03c1 (p) =\n\nq\n\nm2\u03c1 + Re\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 (p) \u2212 m\u03c1 .\n\n(16)\n\nWe assume that the hadronic matter can be considered to be a weakly interacting gas\nof pions and nucleons. In order to test this assumption we have run the UrQMD code in\na box for baryon densities up to twice normal nuclear matter density at temperatures up\nto 150 MeV. The results show that more than 95% of all \u03c1-meson scatterings occur from\npions and nucleons so that it is reasonable to focus on these interactions. We will consider\nnucleon densities of nN =0, 1 and 2 in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density (n0 = 0.16\nnucleons/fm3 ). We assume that the system is in thermal equilibrium with a temperature\nbelow 170 MeV so that hadrons are the approriate degrees of freedom rather than quarks\nand gluons. For densities of 1 and 2 the nucleon chemical potentials are, respectively, 747\nand 821 MeV at T = 100 MeV, and 543 and 650 MeV at T = 150 MeV. Anti-nucleons are\nnot included.\nThe vector meson widths are shown as a function of momentum in Fig. 6 for two\ntemperatures and three nucleon densities. Note that the widths given here are defined to\nbe in the rest frame of the thermal system. (The present results replace those of Eletsky\nand Kapusta [14] since the weighting of the pion contribution was too small there due to\na computer code error. The nucleon contributions still dominate, however.) For \u0393\u03c1 the\nnN = 0 results are little changed from the vacuum value until temperatures of the order of\nthe pion mass are reached. At T = 150 MeV the width generated by collisions with pions is\nabout 50 MeV. This is a factor of two larger than obtained by Haglin [9] using an effective\nLagrangian, but a little less than the 80 MeV reported by Rapp and Gale [7]. Interactions\n7\n\n\fwith nucleons give a 100 MeV contribution to the width at nN = 1, similar to the zero\ntemperature estimate of Kondratyuk et al. [4], and about twice that at nN = 2. Thus at the\nhighest temperatures and densities the width is 2\u20133 times the vacuum value and is becoming\ncomparable to the mass. The middle and lower panels of Fig. 6 are the same for nN = 0\nsince nucleons are not involved in this case. Here the effect of increasing the temperature,\nand therefore the pion density, is much more marked than for the \u03c1 since the vacuum width\nof the \u03c9 is so small. At T = 150 MeV the width is about 50 MeV which is similar to the\nvalue obtained by Schneider and Weise [10] in an effective Lagrangian approach, but a factor\nof two larger than given by Haglin [9] . When the nucleon density is non-zero we expect\nnature to lie somewhere between the larger widths given by the multi-resonance model\n(middle panel) and the smaller widths given by the two-resonance model (lower panel). The\nfunctional dependence on p differs in the two cases. However, for a temperature of 150 MeV\nand nN = 1, \u0393\u03c9 is expected to lie between 100 and 150 MeV. This is an enhancement of the\nvacuum width by a factor of 12\u201318, which is in line with Rapp's estimate [8] of a factor of\n20 at a slightly higher temperature of 180 MeV.\nIn the UrQMD model collisional widths can be obtained by allowing a volume of matter\nto come to equilibrium at a given temperature and baryon density [25]. Then the average\ntime between collisions of a \u03c1 meson with a given species, N or \u03c0, can be determined. The\nreciprocal of this gives the width due to collisional broadening (in units with h\u0304 = 1). In\norder for the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium to make sense detailed balance must\nhold. Therefore, for present purposes, it is necessary to drop the string contribution and\nretain only the resonance contribution [25]. Thus the results should be most reliable at\nlow momenta. We show the UrQMD results for the collisional broadening due to scattering\nfrom pions and nucleons separately in Fig. 7. They are compared with the results discussed\nabove for two representative cases of baryon density, nB , and temperature. For nB = 21\nwith T = 100 MeV and nB = 2 with T = 150 MeV, the baryon chemical potentials are\n630 and 479 MeV, respectively, which correspond to nucleon densities nN \u2243 13 and nN \u2243 32 ,\nwith all densities in units of n0 . The present results agree quite nicely with UrQMD at\nlow momenta, suggesting that interference between sequential scatterings can be ignored at\nthese temperatures and densities as we have done. The deviations at larger momenta give\nsome measure of the role played by the high energy Regge part of the scattering amplitude.\nThe mass shifts for the vector mesons are displayed in Fig. 8. They turn out to be quite\nsmall, at most a few tens of MeV. For both the \u03c1 and the \u03c9 mesons the interaction with\npions alone (nN = 0) produces a small negative \u2206m, while the introduction of nucleons\ngives a positive contribution. For the two \u03c9 models at zero momentum \u2206m\u03c9 is in the range\n\u221215 to +15 MeV. On the other hand at p = 1500 MeV for nN = 2, \u2206m\u03c9 is 30 MeV in\nthe two-resonance model and 50 MeV in the multi-resonance model, somewhat smaller than\n\u2206m\u03c1 = 60 MeV. These trends and numbers for the vector meson mass shifts are roughly\nconsistent with other analyses [5,7,8,10]. However, in nuclear matter at zero temperature\nthe coupled-channel calculation of Friman et al. [6] gives larger shifts and, for the \u03c9, so does\nthe chiral approach of Klingl et al. [3].\n8\n\n\fThe rate of dilepton production is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the\nphoton self-energy [26,27] which is itself proportional to the imaginary part of the \u03c1 meson\npropagator because of vector meson dominance [28,29].\nE+ E\u2212\n\n\u2212Im\u03a0tot\ndR\n\u03c1\n\u221d\n,\n2\ntot 2\nd 3 p+ d 3 p\u2212\n[M 2 \u2212 m2\u03c1 \u2212 Re\u03a0tot\n\u03c1 ] + [Im\u03a0\u03c1 ]\n\n(17)\n\nwhere, as before, M is the invariant mass. For the \u03c1-meson the vacuum part \u03a0vac\ncan\n\u03c1\nbe obtained from the Gounaris-Sakurai formula [28,29]. This formula gives a very good\ndescription of the pion electromagnetic form factor, as measured in e+ e\u2212 annihilation [30],\nup to 1 GeV apart from a small mixing with the \u03c9 meson which we are ignoring in this\npaper.\nRe\u03a0vac\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013#\n\np0 3\n\u03c9 0 + p0\n\u22122\n,\nln\n\u03c90\nm\u03c0\n\u00113/2\ng\u03c12 M 2 \u0010\n1 \u2212 4m2\u03c0 /M 2\n=\u2212\n.\n48\u03c0\n\u0012\n\nIm\u03a0vac\n\u03c1\n\nq\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u00113/2\n1 + 1 \u2212 4m2\u03c0 /M 2\ng2M 2 \u0010\n1\n1\nq\n+ 8m2\u03c0\n\u2212\nln\n= \u03c1 2 \uf8f0 1 \u2212 4m2\u03c0 /M 2\n48\u03c0\nM 2 m2\u03c1\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4m2\u03c0 /M 2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n!\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nq\n\n2\n3\nHere 2\u03c90 = m\u03c1 = 2 m2\u03c0 + p20 . The vacuum width is \u0393vac\n\u03c1 = (g\u03c1 /48\u03c0)m\u03c1 (p0 /\u03c90 ) and the real\npart vanishes on shell. Since the vacuum decay of the \u03c9 into three pions is more complicated,\nwhile the width is tiny, we simply treat it as a constant except for the application of a nonrelativistic phase space factor [(M 2 \u2212 9m2\u03c0 )/(m2\u03c9 \u2212 9m2\u03c0 )]2 from threshold to M = m\u03c9 . A\npossible real vacuum contribution is ignored.\nThe imaginary part of the propagator, proportional to the spectral density, is plotted as\na function of M in Fig. 9 for a temperature of 150 MeV. Pions alone have a small effect\non the spectral density so we display results at nN = 21 , 1 and 2. These parameters are\ncharacteristic of the final stages of a high energy heavy ion collision. As seen from Fig. 9\nthere is little change in the position of the peak, but the spectral density is greatly broadened.\n(In nuclear matter at T = 0 Refs. [5,6] obtain a more complicated structure.) Figure 9 shows\nthat for nN = 1 the width of the \u03c1 peak (full width, half maximum) is 345 MeV which is\nbecoming comparable to the mass of \u03c1 meson and is consistent with the results of Rapp [8].\nFor the \u03c9 meson at this density the peak width is 150 MeV in the multi-resonance model\nand 90 MeV for the two-resonance model, while Rapp's width is intermediate between these\nvalues.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have described the scattering amplitudes for \u03c1 and \u03c9-mesons in terms\nof resonances plus background at low energies matched onto a Regge form at high energies\n9\n\n\f(our amplitudes are available upon request). The parameters were taken from experimental\ndata in order to be as model independent as possible. Of course the data are imperfect,\nparticularly for the \u03c9 meson where we adopted two extreme models with reality expected\nto lie somewhere between the two. Assuming that only single scatterings are important, as\nappears to be justified by comparison with the UrQMD results, it is then straightforward\nto obtain the self-energy at finite density and temperature.\nOur results indicate for the shift in the pole mass a negative contribution from interactions with pions and a positive contribution from interactions with nucleons. The net result\nis small, at most a few tens of MeV. Thus the peak of the spectral density is little shifted,\nbut the width is increased considerably due to collisions in the medium. Collisions with\nnucleons dominate, but the effect of pions is not negligible. At equilibrium nuclear matter\ndensity and a temperature of 150 MeV the width of the spectral density is 345 MeV for\nthe \u03c1 meson, about twice the vacuum width. For the \u03c9 meson the width is expected to lie\nbetween the values of 90 MeV and 150 MeV given by our two extreme models, a considerable\nchange from the vacuum width of just 8.4 MeV. Where possible we have compared with the\nUrQMD model and found quite reasonable agreement. Our results are also quite consistent\nwith those of Rapp and coworkers [7,8] and Schneider and Weise [10].\nThe next step is to use our results in a space-time model of the evolution of matter in\nhigh energy heavy ion collisions. This will allow us to study the extent to which our spectral\ndensities are able to reproduce the observed e+ e\u2212 mass spectra [31]. Such work is underway.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are indebted to B. L. Ioffe for valuable discussions.
