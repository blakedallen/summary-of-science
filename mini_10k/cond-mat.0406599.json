These systems also have\ntechnological importance such as in sensor applications, and especially for increasing\ndata storage by increasing the sensitivity of hard disk drive read heads [1,2]. These\nmanganites become ferromagnetic (FM) at an optimal value of x (or Mn4+ content) and\nundergo metal-insulator (MI) transition around the ferromagnetic transition temperature.\nEffects of divalent alkaline-earth element substitution in the stoichiometric perovskite\nmanganites Ln1-xAxMn1-yMyO3 have been extensively studied [3,5]. These studies show\nthat the Curie temperature, TC, and the magnetoresistance are optimized for Mn4+ content\nof about 33%. These properties are attributed to the double exchange (DE) interaction\nassociated with electron hopping from Mn3+ to Mn4+. The double exchange interaction,\nwhich favors itinerant electron behaviour, is opposed by the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of\n\n1\n\n\fthe Mn3+. Recent studies have shown that DE alone cannot explain the observed behavior\nin manganites [6] and other effects also play an important role. These include charge\nordering, average A-site cationic radius <rA> [7,8], A-size cationic size mismatch [9,10],\noxygen deficiency [11], electron-lattice coupling [12], polaron effect due to strong\nelectron\u2013phonon interaction arising from the Jahn-Teller distortion [6], etc. The average\nsize of the A-site cation of these perovskites and the size mismatch at the A-site modify\nthe Mn-O-Mn bond angle and affect the eg electron hopping between Mn3+ and Mn4+\ndegenerate states. The effect of ionic size variation can also be understood by the\ntolerance factor defined as, t = (<rA> + rO)/\u221a2 (rB+rO), where rO and rB are radii of the\noxygen and the B-site transition metal ions, respectively.\nThe electronic properties of the manganites can be tuned either by substituting\ncations at the A- or B-sites or by varying the oxygen content in the regular perovskites\nstructure [13-15]. The A-site cation is responsible for structural distortions while the Bsite cation is responsible for the magnetic interactions. Mixing cations of different\ncharges at the A-site is the most straightforward experimental method for systematically\ntuning the properties of these materials. There are many ways to achieve this with\nLn3+/M2+ combinations (Ln = rare earth and M = Ca, Ba Sr and Pb) or with rare earth ion\ncombinations. This has led to efforts to unify the properties of compositions from\ndifferent chemical phase diagrams within a single framework by using a simple ionic\ndescription of the A-site cations [16].\nA lot of work has been done on manganites with the single rare earth ion at the Asite. In the present work, we have undertaken to substitute two rare earth ions, namely, Pr\nand Sm at the A-site in a fixed ratio and vary the alkaline earth ion. In this context, we\nhave chosen the series (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) for present studies.\n\nExperimental Details\nThe polycrystalline (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) samples were\nsynthesized by the chemical citrate-gel route using high purity Pr6O11, Sm2O3, CaCO3,\nBaCO3, SrCO3 and Mn-acetate. The as prepared powders were calcined at 1000\u00b0C in air\nfor two hours. The powders were pelletized in the form of rectangular bars and sintered at\n1200oC in air. X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded using Cu-K\u03b1\nradiation (PW 3040/60 Philips, PANalytical). Resistivity measurements at different\napplied magnetic fields were carried out from 320 to 5 K using the standard four-probe\ndc method (PPMS, Quantum Design). Magnetic measurements were made using\n2\n\n\fvibrating sample magnetometer (Oxford, Maglab VSM) at different fields and in the\ntemperature range of 300 K to 5 K.\n\nResults and Discussion\nCrystal Structure\nFigure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns for (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca,\nSr and Ba) compositions. All the lines in the patterns could be indexed on the basis of an\northorhombic structure (space group Pnma No. 62). In Ca-substituted sample, splitting of\nsome of the X-ray lines is observed which is due to increased orthorhombicity of this\ncompound (compared to that of other two). This in turn is due to smaller ionic size of Ca\nion (1.18 \u00c5) in comparison to those of Sr(1.31 \u00c5) and Ba(1.47\u00c5) ions. The average Asite ionic radius, < rA > varies from 1.158 \u00c5 for Ca-, 1.202 \u00c5 for Sr- and 1.255 \u00c5 for Basubstituted samples. The mean radius has been calculated using the coordination number\nnine [17]. The tolerance factors for Ca, Sr and Ba containing compounds are 0.9018,\n0.9173 and 0.9360, respectively. This indicates that the structure tends towards pseudocubic symmetry as one goes from Ca to Ba substituent. The cell volume decreases with\ndecreasing A-site ionic radius.\nThe cell and structural parameters of all the (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr\nand Ba) compounds were refined by the Rietveld method using the computer code\nFULLPROF [18]. The refinement was carried out in the space group Pnma (No. 62) with\nthe following atomic positions: Pr/Sm/A: 4c(x,y,1/4), Mn: 4b(0,0,1/2), O(1): 4c(x,1/4,z)\nand O(2):(x,y,z). The refined lattice parameters are given in Table 1. The oxygen\npositions, derived from the refinement have high errors due to the presence of strong\nscatterers Pr and Sm ions [19]. The best-fit \u03c72 values for Ca, Sr and Ba-substituted\ncompounds are 2.89, 1.54 and 2.62, respectively. A typical refined pattern for one\nsample, namely, the Sr-substituted compound, is shown in Fig. 2.\nElectrical Resistivity\nThe temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, \u03c1(T), for all the\n(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) compounds is shown in Fig. 3. The\nresistivity values are very high for Ca and Ba- substituted compounds over the entire\ntemperature range from 320 K to 50 K and these compounds show semiconducting like\n\n3\n\n\fbehaviour (d\u03c1/dT<1). The typical metal-insulator transition is observed only for Srsubstituted compound.\nIn Ca-substituted sample, (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Ca1/3MnO3, a small anomaly in the\ndln\u03c1/d(kBT)-1 plot is seen around 195 K (inset of Fig. 3) which is a typical feature of\ncharge ordering as also reported for the parent compound Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 [20,21]. It has\nbeen reported that the compounds having tolerance factor around or less than 0.907, may\nexhibit charge order phenomena [22]. The tolerance factor for Ca-substituted sample is\n0.9018 and therefore it is probably the reason for its charge ordering behavior. As\nmentioned earlier, the size of the Ca2+ ion is smaller than those of the Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions,\nwhich in turn creates more structural distortions in the orthorhombic lattice of the Casubstituted compound. Because of this, the Mn-O-Mn bond angle deviates more from\n1800 in this compound. The transfer integral (t) of the eg electrons hopping from Mn3+ to\nMn4+, defined as t = t0 cos(\u03b8/2) (where t0 is the normal transfer integral and \u03b8 is the angle\nbetween two neighbouring spin directions [23]) reduces more drastically in the case of\nCa- and Ba-substituted compounds as compared to that in Sr- substituted compound. This\nleads to suppression of the DE interaction between the Mn3+ and Mn4+ and to higher\nresistivity values in Ca- and Ba- substituted compounds. However, anomaly in\ndln\u03c1/d(kBT)-1 is absent in Ba-substituted compound.\nThe Sr- substituted sample, (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3, exhibits the M-I transition\nsimilar to that observed in parent Pr0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (PSMO) [24], but the TMI is shifted\ntowards lower temperatures. The TMI for Sr-substituted sample, estimated from the\naverage value between minima and maxima of d\u03c1/dT plot, is 156 K which is in between\nthat of 265 K for the parent compounds Pr0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and 100K for Sm2/3Sr1/3MnO3\n(SSMO) [25]. The drop in TMI is due to the variation in the A-site ionic radius <rA> of the\ncompounds. The <rA> for the Sr- substituted sample, (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3, is found to\nbe 1.202 \u00c5 which is in between the <rA> of PSMO (1.223 \u00c5) and SSMO (1.191 \u00c5). The\ndifference between the A-site ionic radius of (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 and SSMO is lower\n(0.011 \u00c5) as compared to that between (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 and PSMO (0.021 \u00c5).\nTherefore, the TMI of 156K for (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 sample is closer to TMI of 100K\nfor SSMO rather than to TMI of 265K for PSMO.\nAlthough metal to insulator transition is observed only in Sr-substitued\n(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 compound, all the (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba)\ncompounds show paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition (see in\n4\n\n\fmagnetization section). In Sr-substituted (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 compound, the TMI and\nTC are very close to each other, which is evidence of long range ferromagnetism. Thus\nfor Ba and Ca \u2013substituted compounds (where MI is not observed), long range\nferromagnetism, due to double exchange, disappears and consequently hinders metallicity\nleading to monotonous increase in resistivity [26].\nThe transport data in semiconducting regime of (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca,\nSr and Ba) compounds has been analyzed by Mott Variable Range Hopping model (MottVRH) [27] according to which\n\u03c1 = \u03c10m exp (T0m/T)1/4\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03c10m is the Mott residual resistivity and T0m is the Mott characteristic temperature.\nEquation (1) is found to fit the data well as shown in Fig. 3b. The values of \u03c10m and T0m\nare listed in Table 2. A small deviation in theoretical fit is observed in Ca-substituted\nsystem at the charge ordering temperature (TCO = 195 K) as indicated by arrow in Fig. 3b.\nThe metallic region in Sr-substituted (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 system has been\nfitted to a Zener-double exchange polynomial\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03c12T2 + \u03c1nTn\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, \u03c10 is the temperature independent residual resistivity due to scattering by\nimpurities, defects, grain boundaries and domain walls. The second term with coefficient\n\u03c12 is ascribed to the electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering mechanism [28] and\nthe third term with coefficient \u03c1n corresponds to the electron-magnon scattering [27]. The\nvalue of n is found to be 7.2 in the Sr- substituted system. The fitted plot is shown in the\ninset of Fig. 3b. The typical fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2.\nMagneto-Resistance\nFigure 4a shows the electrical resistivity behaviour of Sr- substituted,\n(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Sr1/3MnO3 sample in different applied magnetic fields. In the presence of an\nexternal field, the resistivity decreases significantly and TMI shifts to a higher value from\n156 K in zero field to 192 K in 8 T field. This suggests that the external magnetic field\nfacilitates the hopping of eg electron between the neighbouring Mn ions, which agrees\nwith the DE model [29]. The magnetoresistance (MR) is defined as\n% MR = 100 \u00d7 [\u03c1(H, T)- \u03c1(0,T)]/ [\u03c1(0, T)]\n\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere, \u03c1(H,T) and \u03c1(0,T) are the resistivities at a temperature T, in applied magnetic\nfield H and in zero applied magnetic field, respectively. The temperature dependence of\nMR for Sr-substituted compound is showing in Fig. 4b. The MR is quite high (> 95 % at\n8T) at the metal insulator transition temperature. The manganese ions are\nferromagnetically ordered below TC, therefore, within a single magnetic domain, the eg\nelectron transfer between Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions is easy. The pairs of Mn3+ and Mn4+ spins,\nwhich may not be parallel in the vicinity of domain wall boundaries, will act as a\nhindrance for electron transport. The magnetic domains tend to align along the field\ndirection in the presence of sufficiently strong magnetic field. As a result, hopping of\nelectrons become easy across the domain wall boundaries and resistivity decreases, which\nin turn leads to significant MR at low temperatures. Unlike in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3, the MR in\nSr-substituted compound does not drop to a low value at low temperatures but rather\nremains high and weakly temperature dependent below 100 K due to the inter grain\ntunneling at low temperatures [15].\nThe\n\ntemperature\n\ndependence\n\nof\n\nMR\n\nfor\n\nBa-\n\nand\n\nCa-\n\nsubstituted\n\n(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 compounds is shown in Fig. 4c. It is remarkable to note that for\nBa substituted sample, MR is ~99% at low temperatures in 8 Tesla magnetic fields while\nthe same is around 60% for Ca-substituted sample though the temperature dependence of\nMR exhibits similar nature in the two. The continuous rise in MR with decreasing\ntemperature and its large value in Ba- and Ca- substituted samples appear to be due to\nelectronic phase separation, where presumably the ferromagnetic (FM) clusters start\ngrowing at the expense of anti ferromagnetic clusters with decreasing temperature in high\nfield of 8T. Similar MR behavior has been observed in (La0.6Ho0.4)0.7Sr0.3MnO3 [30].\nMagnetization\nThe plots of magnetization (M) as a function of temperature (T) for\n(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) compounds are shown in Fig.5 a-c. In Casubstituted sample, at low fields (0.01T), the magnetization (M) shows irreversibility\nbetween the zero-field cooled (ZFC) and the field cooled (FC) state below 150 K. This\nirreversibility becomes very strong below around 40 K. At higher field (above 0.2 T), as\nshown in the inset (a) of Fig.5a, the irreversibility is observed only below 40 K. The\nmagnetic transition temperatures have been determined from the minima in the dM/dT\nplots. In Pr0.65Ca0.35MnO3, a charge ordering (CO) transition at 230 followed by AF\ntransition around 165 K has been reported [31]. In the Ca- substituted sample,\n6\n\n\f(Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Ca1/3MnO3, we observe a weak signature of AF transition below 150 K,\nwhere also setting in of irreversibility between ZFC and FC magnetization is seen. The\nappearance of irreversibility in M could be attributed to magnetic frustration generated\ndue to competing FM and AFM moments as found in the neutron diffraction studies on\nPr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 [32].\nFor Ba-substituted (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3Ba1/3MnO3 sample, the irreversibility between\nZFC and FC magnetization is seen below 50 K both in 0.01T and 0.1T field (Fig. 5c).\nThis behavior is similar to that found in cluster glasses. In the case of Sr-substituted\nsample, a ferromagnetic transition is observed at Tc=158 K ( Fig. 5b), which is same as\nthe metal-insulator transition temperature in zero field. Below TC, irreversibility between\nZFC and FC magnetization is observed, which could be due to domain wall pinning.\nFurther, below around 25 K, M(T) drops presumably due to competing superexchange\nand double exchange interactions resulting in the formation of localized spin clusters.\nFigure 6 shows the isothermal magnetization at 5 K for (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3\n(A = Ca , Sr and Ba) compounds. The magnetization of Sr-substituted compound shows\nnear saturation and its value is 3.62 \u03bcB/Mn , which is close to the theoretical value (3.7\n\u03bcB/Mn). The magnetization of Ba and Ca-substituted samples do not saturate even in a\nfield of 4 T. The Ba-substituted sample shows a large remanence in M(H=0) indicating\npresence of strong FM phase in it. The non-saturating near linear behavior is observed in\nCa-substituted system at 5 K even up to 5 T magnetic field, which is expected in a AF or\nspin-glass like state. The non saturating M-H behavior for Ca and Ba\u2013substituted samples\nmay also result due to the presence of well-separated charge delocalized ferromagnetic\nclusters in the antiferromagnetic insulating matrix [33]. These clusters start growing\nwithin the matrix with increasing magnetic field.\nThe field dependence of magnetization as shown in Fig. 6 supports the MR\nbehavior, i.e Sr-substituted sample is ferromagnetic, the Ba-substituted sample has a spin\nglass (or cluster glass) type of disorder giving rise to a non saturating behavior even at 8\nT (Presumably in this compound electronic phase separation is quite significant). In the\nCa-substituted compound, the charge ordered state is much more robust, having a nearly\nAF state. However the large MR (~ 60 %) at low temperature suggests that, there is\nelectronic phase separation in this compound too.\n\n7\n\n\fConclusions\nWe have investigated the effect of alkaline earth ion substitution on the structural\nand magneto-transport properties of (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba)\ncompounds. Synthesized samples crystallize in the orthorhombic structure (space group\nPnma No. 62). The Ba- and Ca-substituted, (Pr1/3Sm2/3)2/3A1/3MnO3, (A = Ca and Ba)\nsamples show an insulating behavior. However, a small anomaly due to charge ordering\nis observed around 195 K for Ca- substituted sample only. Unlike Ba- and Ca-substituted\nsamples, the Sr- substituted sample shows metal to insulator transition. Spin glass/cluster\nlike behavior is observed in Ca- and Ba-substituted samples, which is also supported by\nthe non saturating behavior in M-H plots. The non saturating MR value at low\ntemperatures is observed in the case of Ca and Ba-substituted samples. In addition, Basubstituted sample exhibits a very high MR (~99%) in 8T magnetic field. The magnetic\nbehavior is attributed due to the electronic phase separation.\n\nAcknowledgement\nTwo of authors (SA and DB), are thankful to the Department of Science and Technology\n(DST) India for support of the project.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n1.
